As some of the readers of my other thread have requested to see my other, much longer fic in progress, I now present "A Crown Of Stars", the authorized continuation of LVDB's excellent "A Throne of Bayonets", available here on FFnet. I highly, highly recommend this excellent, post-Third Impact continuation fic. It perfectly captures the bleak, despairing-with-only-the-faintest-glimmers-of-hope-at-the-very-end feel of Neon Genesis Evangelion, so much so that when I read it I felt Shinji and Asuka deserved a happier ending. I asked LVDB if they minded me trying my hand at a sequel, and was granted permission to try. That was 2 years and 232,000 words ago.
正如我在其他帖子的一些读者所请求，希望看到我正在创作的另一部更长的作品，现在我呈现给大家《星辰之冠》，这是 LVDB 的杰作《权杖之座》的官方续集，可在 FFnet 上找到。我强烈推荐这部优秀的、第三次冲击后的续集。它完美地捕捉了《新世纪福音战士》中那种绝望中仅存一丝希望的末世氛围，以至于当我阅读时，我觉得真嗣和明日香应该有一个更幸福的结局。我问过 LVDB 是否介意我尝试续写，并得到了尝试的许可。那已经是两年前的事了，字数已达 232,000 字。

Giving them a happy ending was harder than I thought.
给他们一个幸福的结局比我想象的要难。

This was also a never-meant-to-be-published way to kill time while I was deployed to Afghanistan, so it features a good deal of me taking out an original universe I'd built to play with. But I kept the focus on our Evangelion Pilots: this is their story, not the OU's.
这原本也是一种未打算发表的消磨时间的方式，当时我被派往阿富汗，所以其中包含了我大量地运用自己构建的原宇宙来娱乐的内容。但我始终将焦点放在我们的福音战士驾驶员身上：这是他们的故事，而非原宇宙的。

I'm going to start putting the still-incomplete (95% done) work up here. "A Throne of Bayonets" is just 27k words, but if you really can't pop over to read it, here's my attempt at a summarized condensation of both Neon Genesis Evangelion and "A Throne of Bayonets" in 1600 words or so:
我打算开始在这里发布尚未完成（已完成 95%）的作品。《刺刀王座》虽然只有 2.7 万字，但如果你实在无法抽空阅读，这里是我尝试将《新世纪福音战士》与《刺刀王座》浓缩在约 1600 字左右的概述：

Once there was a boy named Shinji. He had a hard life.
从前有个名叫真嗣的男孩，他的生活很艰难。
His mother died and his father abandoned him at age 4. At 14, his father summoned him back to fight aliens bent on ending the world. His father neglected to mention that he planned to end the world anyway too.
他的母亲去世了，父亲在他四岁时抛弃了他。到了 14 岁，他的父亲召他回来与一心毁灭世界的异形作战。他的父亲却未曾提及，他自己也计划着毁灭世界。

Once there was a girl named Asuka. She had a hard life. Her mother died and her father abandoned her at age 4. At 13, she was sent to fight aliens bent on ending the world. Her commander neglected to mention that he planned to end the world anyway too.
从前有一个名叫明日香的女孩。她的生活很艰难。她的母亲去世了，她的父亲在她四岁时抛弃了她。十三岁时，她被送去与一心想要毁灭世界的异形生物战斗。她的指挥官没有告诉她，他自己也计划毁灭世界。

They fought aliens because they had to. They fought each other because they were each convinced they were terrible, unlovable people, and afraid of opening up lest the vulnerability thereby exposed lead to more pain. They could not communicate, and never learned just how alike they were. So they fought together, but alone in spirit, because fear of pain and miscommunication kept them from connecting. Even a shared kiss only led to more tears and distance.
他们之所以与异形战斗，是因为他们不得不这么做。他们之所以彼此争斗，是因为他们都确信自己是糟糕的、不可爱的人，害怕敞开心扉，唯恐因此暴露的脆弱会带来更多痛苦。他们无法沟通，也从未意识到彼此有多么相似。因此，他们并肩作战，精神上却孤独，因为对痛苦的恐惧和沟通不畅使他们无法建立联系。即使是一个共同的吻，也只带来了更多的泪水和距离。

Then things got worse. Their pain and the war beat them down until they both broke, with catatonia and suicidal depression the only ends in sight.
然后情况变得更糟。他们的痛苦和战争将他们击垮，直到他们都崩溃了，只有紧张症和自杀性抑郁症是可见的结局。

Then the world ended. Shinji's pain led to him betraying Asuka when she needed him most. Asuka's pain led to her betraying Shinji when he needed her most. And because the power of a god had been given into Shinji's hands right as he was betrayed, he told the world it could just go die, if pain was all it offered him.
最终，世界毁灭了。真嗣的痛苦导致他在明日香最需要他的时候背叛了她。明日香的痛苦导致她在真嗣最需要她的时候背叛了他。而就在真嗣被背叛的同时，神的力量被赋予了他，他告诉世界，如果痛苦是它所能给予的全部，那么它大可以去死。

But his mother's spirit spoke to him, and convinced him that despite all the pain he'd suffered, happiness was still possible, but only in a world where pain could also find him. Shinji decided that the chance of happiness was worth the trial, and restored the world.
但他的母亲之灵向他诉说，并使他相信，尽管他遭受了所有的痛苦，幸福仍然是可能的，但只有在痛苦也能找到他的世界里。真嗣决定，追求幸福的机会值得一试，于是他恢复了世界。

But the restored world was still a wreck, a depopulated, chaos-ridden mess of warlords, bandits, and the terrified, starving masses. Six months of keeping a nearly-catatonic and bitterly angry Asuka alive in this world drained Shinji. Then one warlord, General Winthrop, more ruthless and clever than the rest, seized the remnants of NERV-Berlin, its MAGI, and control of the UN's remaining N2 warhead stockpile. He 'acquired' the former Evangelion Pilots from their latest warlord 'hosts', and began work on completing three remaining Mass Production Evangelions.
然而，恢复后的世界依旧是一片废墟，一个无人居住、混乱不堪、充斥着军阀、强盗和恐惧饥饿民众的烂摊子。在这个世界中维持近似于木僵状态且满怀怨恨的明日香的生命六个月，让真嗣精疲力尽。随后，一个比其他军阀更为残忍狡猾的温思罗普将军，夺取了 NERV 柏林的残余部分、其 MAGI 系统以及联合国剩余的 N2 弹头储备。他从最近的军阀“主人”那里“获得”了前 EVA 驾驶员，并开始着手完成三台剩余的量产型 EVA。

A desperate Asuka, not yet 16 and convinced Shinji could not protect her or would inevitably let her down again, 'voluntarily' went to Winthrop for protection. She spent over a year as his toy before he tired of her and gave her to his chief of staff, Colonel Jinnai. She spent two years with him before Shinji was allowed to return to Berlin. He had been left in exile in Boston, a precaution by Winthrop to ensure the former Third Child did not do anything like try to 'rescue' Asuka.
绝望的明日香，未满 16 岁，深信真嗣无法保护她或终将再次让她失望，“自愿”前往温斯洛寻求庇护。她在那里作为他的玩物度过了一年多，直到他厌倦了她，将她转给了他的参谋长，金井上校。在真嗣被允许返回柏林之前，她与他共度了两年时光。真嗣此前被流放在波士顿，这是温斯洛为确保这位前第三适格者不会试图“营救”明日香而采取的预防措施。

His return was because the Mass Production Evas were nearly complete, and as the last two Evangelion Pilots in the world, Winthrop expected them to Pilot for him, so that he could subdue the last parts of the ravaged world that were not yet under his control. But Colonel Jinnai had other plans, and blackmailed Shinji and Asuka into taking part in a coup against Winthrop. Blackmail by means of news about the fate of Shinji's father... and Asuka's reincarnated mother. Learning that she had been brought back to life in the restoration of the world, but then executed by Winthrop's orders drove Asuka to attempt suicide. She was bitterly angry when Shinji stopped her, so much so that she lashed out hard at him, accusing him of never wanting anything from her but selfish comfort and blaming his inaction during the Battle of the Geofront for leading to her death. In the end, she dares him to kill her for real, just like he started to during Instrumentality and on the beach where they awoke.
他的归来是因为量产型 EVA 即将完工，作为世界上最后两位 EVA 驾驶员，温斯洛期望他们为自己驾驶，以便征服那些尚未被他掌控的残破世界。然而，金井上校另有图谋，利用有关真嗣父亲命运的消息以及明日香转世母亲的信息，胁迫真嗣和明日香参与针对温斯洛的政变。得知自己在世界恢复中被复活，却又被温斯洛下令处决，明日香悲愤至极，试图自杀。真嗣阻止她时，她愤怒至极，激烈指责真嗣只图自我安慰，从未真正需要她，并归咎于他在地底都市战役中的无所作为导致了她的死亡。最终，她激将真嗣，要求他像在人类补完计划中及他们苏醒的海滩上那样，真正地杀死她。

Leaving the apartment before Asuka blurts out anything about the impending coup to listening ears, Shinji falls asleep in a park nearby. He has a dream-conversation with Rei Ayanami that he isn't sure is real, wherein Rei reveals that she is saddened to hear he is still with Asuka, even though she does not care for him... while Rei does. Shinji is surprised by the revelation, but tries to decline Rei's offer to harvest his soul when he dies. Rei says she will wait for him.
在明日香泄露即将发生的政变消息之前离开公寓，真嗣在附近的公园睡着了。他做了一个与绫波丽对话的梦，不确定是否真实，梦中绫波丽透露她听到他仍与明日香在一起感到难过，尽管她并不在乎他...而绫波丽却在意。真嗣对这一发现感到惊讶，但试图拒绝绫波丽在他死后收集他灵魂的提议。绫波丽说她会等他。

Waking and returning to the apartment, Shinji decides it's time to take responsibility for his sins, and writes a fake note to Asuka, claiming he was in on the coup and that she knew nothing, in the hope that if the coup fails it will insulate her from reprisal. But when he hides the note in her room, she sees him, reads the note, and assumes he's about to leave. She tries to preempt him, leaving when he falls asleep, and going to Jinnai to make the same offer; start the coup now and I'm in, but leave him out of it.
醒来后回到公寓，真嗣决定是时候为自己的罪行负责，于是给明日香写了一封假信，声称他参与了政变而她一无所知，希望如果政变失败，这能保护她免受报复。但当他把信藏在她的房间时，她看到了他，读了信，并以为他即将离开。她试图抢先一步，在他睡着时离开，去找神无去提出同样的提议；现在就开始政变，我加入，但把他排除在外。

She is seen by one of Withrop's watchers, and the coup starts a week before Jinnai was ready. Asuka is shot in the stomach in the opening moments, and Jinnai orders Shinji be picked up to pilot the Mass Production Eva in case Asuka is useless. She does not take the implication well, but survives the hazardous trip to NERV-Berlin, where she is reunited with Shinji. He is shocked to see her trying to move with a seeping gunshot wound in her belly, and carries her through the hallways of NERV Central while they are shot at. Asuka tries to get him to leave her, but Shinji adamantly refuses. They crawl through the ducts to reach the Eva cages, only to find two of the three MP Evas have been taken by Winthrop's forces.
她被威思洛普的一名监视者发现，政变在阵内准备就绪前一周开始。在开场时刻，明日香腹部中弹，阵内命令将真嗣接来驾驶量产型 EVA，以防明日香无法行动。她对这一暗示反应不佳，但幸存下来，艰难抵达 NERV 柏林分部，在那里与真嗣重逢。看到她带着渗血的枪伤试图移动，真嗣震惊不已，并抱着她穿过 NERV 总部的走廊，同时遭到射击。明日香试图让他丢下自己，但真嗣坚决拒绝。他们爬过管道到达 EVA 机库，却发现三台量产型 EVA 中有两台已被威思洛普的部队夺走。

When Asuka tries to synchronize with the last MP Eva, she can barely manage 14%, not enough to activate it. Shinji joins her in the Entry Plug, knowing the two of them together can reach the threshold. They launch, and for a while their presence turns the tide.
当明日香试图与最后一台量产型 EVA 同步时，她仅能达到 14%，不足以激活它。真嗣与她一同进入插入栓，知道两人合力能跨过门槛。他们出击后，一度扭转了战局。

Then the other two Evas appear.
随后，另外两台 EVA 出现了。

Shinji balks when Asuka tries to move them into urban Berlin to fight, preferring to avoid civilian casualties even if they lose. Asuka almost attacks him, and gets him to fight only by pointing out that if he really wanted her to die, he shouldn't have stopped her suicide attempt. He reluctantly urges the Eva into battle.
当明日香试图将他们转移到柏林市区作战时，真嗣犹豫不决，宁愿冒着失败的风险也要避免平民伤亡。明日香几乎要攻击他，最终通过指出如果他真的希望她死去，就不应该阻止她的自杀企图，才勉强说服他投入战斗。他无奈地催促着 Eva 投入战斗。

Asuka's hand-to-hand combat skills and a last minute idea with the Positron Rifle and their S2 engine gives them a narrow victory. In the aftermath, Shinji tries to ask Asuka if she loves him at all... and she says 'no' before he even finishes the question. She avoids thinking even to herself that it's because she feels she does not deserve to. But nevertheless, she tells Shinji, 'You win by default. There's no one else alive I can relate to. You're all I've got left,' and surrenders to a psuedo-relationship with him. She even offers sex, but no love, no intimacy at all. Asuka does not expect him to accept it.
明日香的近战技巧以及利用阳电子步枪和 S2 引擎的最后一刻策略，为他们带来了险胜。战后，真嗣试图询问明日香是否真的爱他，然而他还没问完，她就回答了“不”。她甚至不愿在内心承认，这是因为她觉得自己不配拥有爱。但无论如何，她告诉真嗣：“你赢了，因为没有其他人活着我可以交流。你是我仅剩的一切。”她屈服于一种伪关系，甚至提出性关系，但绝无爱情或亲密。明日香并不期待他接受。

Desperate, lonely, and needing her just as much, Shinji tiredly says 'It's better than nothing.' Asuka even tiredly jokes about a kiss. Shinji wonders if they can even trust their memories of their lives before Instrumentality. The thought unsettles Asuka.
绝望、孤独，同样迫切需要她，真嗣疲惫地说：“总比什么都没有好。”明日香甚至疲惫地开了个关于接吻的玩笑。真嗣怀疑他们是否还能信任自己对统一体之前生活的记忆。这个想法让明日香感到不安。

On their return to the hangar, Asuka tells Shinji she has an urgent task to attend to, and leaves. The task is the other part of her bargain with Jinnai: That she gets to personally finish off Winthrop. In a dark sub-basement, she confronts the captured dictator with a pistol. He taunts her as a slut, and questions why she is doing this. When she tells him it's for her mother, Winthrop doesn't believe her, sure it's for someone else... someone she's closer to. Asuka empties the pistol into his face, then leaves, reminding Jinnai that Shinji can never hear about any of this.
返回机库后，明日香告诉真嗣她有一项紧急任务要处理，随即离开。这项任务是她与阵内交易的另一部分：她要亲自终结温斯洛普。在昏暗的地下室里，她手持手枪面对被俘的独裁者。他辱骂她是荡妇，并质疑她为何这么做。当她说是为了母亲时，温斯洛普不相信，认为是为了更亲近的人。明日香将手枪子弹尽数射入他的脸庞，随后离去，并提醒阵内，真嗣永远不能知道这一切。

A month later, Shinji and Asuka are visited by Aoba, the only other surviving NERV Member they know of. He's being promoted and sent to a well-paid sinecure job, lest he get ideas about being part of another coup. Shinji and Asuka are about to set sail from Marseilles for South America with the UN fleet Jinnai as assembled to bring the warlords of that region under his control. Shinji was going to be sent alone, but Asuka threatened to go on strike if Jinnai tried to separate them. They argue about Shinji's giving money to people the secret police haul away as possible subversives, and Asuka leaves, telling Shinji 'if you need to use me for sex, I'll be in the tent. '
一个月后，真嗣和明日香被他们所知的唯一幸存的 NERV 成员直子拜访。他即将被提拔并派往一个高薪闲职，以免他产生参与另一次政变的念头。真嗣和明日香即将从马赛启航前往南美，与联合国舰队一起，这是神奈为了将该地区的军阀置于其控制之下而集结的。原本真嗣将独自前往，但明日香威胁说如果神奈试图将他们分开，她将罢工。他们就真嗣给那些被秘密警察当作可能的颠覆分子抓走的人送钱一事发生争执，明日香离开时告诉真嗣：“如果你需要利用我进行性行为，我会在帐篷里。”

He falls into a doze, and has another dream-vision of Ayanami. She asks if this is the life he wanted, and tells him again she will wait for him.
他陷入瞌睡，又梦见了绫波。她问他这是否是他想要的生活，并再次告诉他她会等他。

In the tent, he and Asuka argue again when he mentions he bought her a copy of the Time Machine. She knows he is trying to start a discussion about how their lives might have been different, happier, and doesn't want to think about it. She smiles just the slightest bit when he reveals the entire bag of rare working videogames he bought for her. Asuka hints that Shinji's father might not have been executed like her mother. As the sun sets, she asks him to play his cello for her as she falls asleep: Bach's Cello Concerto No.1, the song he was playing the day they kissed, in days long since, before these last so bad.
在帐篷里，他和明日香再次争吵，当他提到为她买了一本《时间机器》时。她知道他试图开启一个关于他们的生活可能如何不同、更幸福的讨论，而她不想去想这些。当他透露为她买了一整袋稀有的工作用视频游戏时，她微微一笑。明日香暗示真嗣的父亲可能没有像她母亲那样被处决。随着太阳落山，她请求他为她拉大提琴，让她入睡：巴赫的第一号大提琴协奏曲，那是他们很久以前接吻那天他演奏的曲子，在那些糟糕的日子之前。

And with that, my story begins, just after the last notes of Bach fade away.
随着巴赫的最后一个音符消逝，我的故事就此开始。

### Chapter 01 "Long is the way and hard,..."
“道路漫长且艰难，……”

A wide tent sat on a seashore near what was left of Marseilles, the wan light from a camp lantern faintly glowing inside. On one wall the light threw a silhouette of a thin young man with a cello, slowly sawing his way through Bach's Cello Suite No. 1. Within, a red-haired young woman lay on her side in a sleeping bag, facing away from the young man so he would not see the tense, worried expression on her face. But the deep notes of the cello gently worked their magic on her, and her face slowly began to relax into a calm, restful state. She began to truly relax, and allowed herself let go of the day and her legion of worries, not a few of which orbited around the cellist. Asuka Langley Sohryu was nearly asleep by the time Shinji Ikari reached the end of the piece, and silently rose to place his cello back into its case.
一顶宽大的帐篷坐落在马赛残迹附近的海岸上，营地灯的微弱光线在里面隐约闪烁。在一面墙上，灯光投射出一个瘦削年轻人的剪影，他正拿着大提琴，缓缓地演奏着巴赫的大提琴组曲第一号。帐篷内，一位红发少女侧躺在睡袋里，背对着年轻人，以免他看到她脸上紧张而忧虑的表情。然而，大提琴的深沉音符温柔地施展着它们的魔力，她的面容逐渐放松，进入一种平静、安详的状态。她开始真正放松，让自己放下一天和无数的忧虑，其中不少是围绕着这位大提琴手。当碇真嗣演奏完这首曲子时，惣流·明日香·兰格雷几乎已经睡着了，他默默地起身将大提琴放回琴盒。

Asuka's rest did not last long undisturbed. Shinji was just rising from replacing his cello in its padded trunk when the sun rose in their tent.
明日香的休息并未持续太久，未被打扰。当太阳在他们帐篷中升起时，真嗣刚把大提琴放回加垫的箱子里起身。

Shinji whirled around. "What?" He blinked his eyes repeatedly against the sudden blaze of gold. A perfect seven-foot circle of seeming daylight stood on the far side of the tent, filling the tent with noontime brightness. Shading his eyes with his hand allowed Shinji a slightly better look at it. Almost too bright to look at directly, it seemed for all the world like a floodlit pool stood on its side. Shinji had only a moment to stare in confusion when the light dimmed as a man stepped out of it. This did not diminish his puzzlement.
真嗣猛地转过身来。“什么？”他对着突如其来的金色光芒不停地眨眼。一个完美的七英尺圆圈，仿佛白昼一般，矗立在帐篷的另一侧，将帐篷内照得如同正午般明亮。用手遮住眼睛，真嗣得以稍微清晰地观察那光芒。它亮得几乎无法直视，看起来就像是一池被照亮的水竖立起来。真嗣刚来得及困惑地凝视片刻，光芒就随着一个男人从中走出而减弱了。但这并没有减少他的困惑。

"Pilot Ikari Shinji-san?" The man inquired in Japanese.
"碇真嗣驾驶员，是吗？"那人用日语询问道。

"Third, what's th-" Asuka blinked awake in her suddenly brightly lit sleeping bag, then bolted upright. "Who the hell are you?! What is that?"
第三，这是什么——"明日香在突然被照亮的睡袋中醒来，随即猛地坐起。"你他妈是谁？！那是什么东西？

"Fr?ulein Pilot Asuka Langley Sohryu? I'm sorry to interrupt your rest, but this is the earliest I could arrive." Shinji still could hardly see the backlit figure, just a caped silhouette. The figure noted his squint. "Ah, my apologies for the brightness of the portal. Rather a large energy differential between here and home. Let me get that." He snapped his fingers and the glowing mini-sun shrank to a point and vanished. The near-daylight illumination dropped to just the solitary camp lantern hanging at the tent's entryway.
"明日香·兰格雷·索拉尔小姐？很抱歉打扰您休息，但我只能在这个时间到达。" 真嗣仍然几乎看不清背光中的身影，只是一个披着斗篷的轮廓。那身影注意到他眯起了眼睛。"啊，抱歉，门户的光线太亮了。这里和家的能量差异相当大。我来调整一下。" 他打了个响指，那发光的小太阳缩小成一个点然后消失了。近乎白昼的照明减弱到只剩下帐篷入口处悬挂的一盏孤灯。

Shinji and Asuka now had a much better view of their strange guest. The gold-trimmed royal blue armor-and-cape outfit the stranger wore was in keeping with the bizarre nature of his entrance. His face was rather more normal in appearance, blue eyes calmly regarding them over a short red beard. The dim light of the tent hid further details. He met their stares for a moment, then began again.
真嗣和明日香现在能更清楚地看到这位奇怪的访客了。这位陌生人穿着金边皇家蓝的盔甲斗篷装，与他奇特的入场方式相符。他的面容相对正常，蓝色的眼睛在短红胡须上方平静地注视着他们。帐篷内的昏暗光线隐藏了更多细节。他迎着他们的目光看了一会儿，然后再次开口。

"Good evening, Pilots. Please allow me to introduce myself. I am a man of wealth and ta… great power." He smiled for second. "My name is Daniel. I come from …mm…far outside your world. I have heard your story and consider you two to have been very poorly treated by your gods and your fate. I have a passionate interest in justice, so I have come in the hope that you will allow me to help you. I would like to be your friend. I would like to offer you…well, as much as I can, I'd like to give back everything that has been taken from you."
晚上好，飞行员们。请允许我自我介绍。我是个富有的男人，拥有巨大的权力。"他微笑了一秒。"我叫丹尼尔。我来自……嗯……远离你们的世界。我听说了你们的故事，认为你们的神和命运对你们非常不公。我对正义充满热情，因此我来到这里，希望你们能允许我帮助你们。我想成为你们的朋友。我想给予你们……嗯，尽我所能，我想把你们失去的一切都还给你们。

"What are you talking about? Who are you? What do you want?" Asuka snapped at him. 'Damn it, why didn't I make sure I had a weapon?' she thought urgently. There was nothing in the tent more dangerous than a pocketknife, forget an actual pistol or anything. She shot a look at Shinji. He was close to the tent door, still standing next to the trunk holding his cello. 'Baka could make it out to get someone, but probably won't want to 'leave me defenseless''.
你在说什么？你是谁？你想要什么？"明日香对他厉声说道。'该死，为什么我没确保自己有武器？'她急切地想。帐篷里除了一个小折刀外，没有任何比这更危险的东西，更别提真正的手枪或任何东西了。她瞥了一眼真嗣。他站在帐篷门口附近，仍然站在放着他大提琴的箱子旁边。'笨蛋可能会出去找人，但可能不想'让我毫无防备'。

"'Who are you?' and 'What do you want?' are the questions I want to ask you, actually. I wish to restore everything; your faith, your hope, your innocence, your friends, your…families. I have powers that can do almost anything, and I want to help you both. I realize that my odd manner of arrival and the intrusion may make it difficult to believe, but I assure you I mean you no harm," Daniel replied. "I know that given your pasts, you are hardly likely to trust someone just popping up and offering to help you, so I'll promise you two things right up front; I'll never lie to you, and I won't look into your minds without permission. As for believing me, I brought with me a couple of people that I hope you will trust enough to extend at least a little to me as well." He snapped his fingers again. A spark of light in the air behind him swiftly expanded into the golden portal again. He stuck his hand back through it and gestured.
"其实，我想问你们的是'你是谁？'和'你想要什么？'。我希望恢复一切：你们的信仰、希望、纯真、朋友，还有你们的家人。我拥有几乎无所不能的力量，真心想帮助你们。我明白，我这突如其来的方式和闯入可能让人难以置信，但我保证，我对你们绝无恶意。"丹尼尔回答道，"我知道鉴于你们的过去，你们不太可能轻易相信一个突然出现并表示要帮助你们的人。所以，我先向你们承诺两件事：我永远不会对你们撒谎，也不会未经允许窥探你们的思想。至于是否相信我，我带来了几个人，希望你们能信任他们，从而至少对我也有一点信任。"他再次打了个响指，身后空中的一道光迅速扩展成金色传送门。他伸手穿过传送门，做了个手势。

The light dimmed again as two more people stepped through. Asuka could just make out a man and a woman, holding hands. Daniel snapped again. The portal once more shrank out of existence, and Asuka and Shinji's eyes widened. The new pair were smiling nervously, and very familiar. Impossibly familiar. Shinji's first thought after a long, stunned pause was 'Am I really that tall?'
灯光再次暗淡，又有两人走了进来。明日香勉强能辨认出一男一女，手牵手。丹尼尔再次打了个响指。传送门又一次缩小消失，明日香和真嗣的眼睛瞪得更大了。新来的两人紧张地微笑着，非常熟悉。熟悉得不可思议。在长时间的震惊之后，真嗣的第一个念头是：‘我真的有那么高吗？’

Shinji and Asuka stared back at Shinji and Asuka. "Um….hi," the new Shinji ventured. He glanced aside at Daniel. "You were right, this is really strange from the other side," he said quietly.
真嗣和明日香回望着真嗣和明日香。“呃……嗨，”新来的真嗣试探着说。他瞥了一眼丹尼尔。“你是对的，从另一边看真的很奇怪，”他轻声说道。

"You get used to it, Shinji. And technically, I will be right. I haven't said that yet. This is six months in my past, too." He smiled again and waved towards the stunned pair on the other side of the tent. "You kids talk for a bit. I'll go make some other pick-ups and be back shortly." He snapped his fingers again and vanished.
“你会习惯的，真嗣。而且严格来说，我将会是对的。我还没说过那句话。这也是我六个月前的过去。”他再次微笑，向帐篷另一边震惊的两人挥手。“你们年轻人聊一会儿。我去接其他人，很快就回来。”他再次打了个响指，消失了。

Asuka's mouth was still hanging open. Her mind was nearly as paralyzed as her body, stuck in a repeating loop of 'What….how…we…they…holding hands? …is she…am I pregnant?! What…how…' The newly arrived pair looked at each other, smiled, and broke their handclasp to each walk towards their counterpart. Asuka watched her…self?...approach with the frozen focus of a mouse watching a hawk swoop closer. Her eyes kept snapping between the other Asuka's face and the distinct bulge to her abdomen. The loose red dress she wore had an intricate, swirling pattern, but that did not conceal the unmistakable bulge of a little guest. The doppelg?nger stopped next to her sleeping bag and sat down. "Good evening, 'me'." She laughed weakly.
明日香的嘴巴依旧张着，她的思绪几乎和身体一样僵硬，陷入了'什么…怎么…我们…他们…牵手了？…她…我怀孕了吗？！什么…怎么…'的循环中。新来的两人相视一笑，松开了紧握的手，各自走向对方。明日香目不转睛地看着…自己？…带着一种老鼠看着鹰俯冲而来的凝固专注。她的目光在另一个明日香的脸和明显隆起的腹部之间来回跳跃。她穿的宽松红裙有着复杂旋涡图案，但并未遮住那明显的小客人。这个分身在她的睡袋旁坐下，虚弱地笑道：“晚上好，‘我’。”

"I…I…" Asuka couldn't even begin. It was her own voice, speaking plain German. Asuka felt dizzy. Her double looked at her for a moment, then sighed.
"我…我…" 明日香甚至开不了口。那是她自己的声音，说着流利的德语。明日香感到眩晕。她的分身看了她一会儿，然后叹了口气。

"Ok, you're in shock, I know. I remember. So I'm going to say the same thing I heard when I was sitting where you are: He can give us Mama back."
好吧，我知道你很震惊。我记得我当时也是这样。所以我会说同样的话，就像我坐在你现在这个位置时听到的那样：他能把妈妈还给我们。

Asuka's mind slammed to a stop. "W..what?"
明日香的思绪戛然而止。"什…什么？"

"He…didn't bring it up at first because he knew we'd think it was crazy. Or that he was. But he told…is telling the truth. He can give us everything back! Including Mama!" The smile on the double's face was fragile but intense. "He…he…does it. He brings her back. Shinji's mother too. And more…I'm not supposed to say too much. Too many good surprises I would give away. But you can trust him. He hasn't lied to us yet. And wait until you see Avalon! You won't believe…I mean, you will…the world he takes us to…" She trailed off, noting her counterpart's confusion. "Right, now you've gotten as far as wondering 'How do I know you're me?' I remember. So here, something that only I know because only I was there: When I ran into the bathroom to 'wash my mouth out' after I kissed the Third Child that first time, I did it to hide the fact I was about to break down in tears because he hadn't held me. I was turned on and wanted the embrace, and he froze. And I thought he was rejecting me. Do you remember that?"
他起初没有提起，因为他知道我们会认为这太疯狂，或者他疯了。但他说的……是真的。他能让我们的一切都回来！包括妈妈！" 双胞胎脸上的笑容脆弱却强烈。"他……他做到了。他把她带回来了。还有真嗣的母亲。还有更多……我不该说太多。太多美好的惊喜会被我泄露。但你可以相信他。他还没对我们撒过谎。等你看到阿瓦隆就知道了！你不会相信的……我是说，你会的……他带我们去的世界……" 她停了下来，注意到对方的困惑。"对，现在你开始怀疑'我怎么知道你是我的？' 我记得。所以这里，只有我知道的事情，因为只有我在场：第一次亲吻第三适格者后，我跑进浴室说要'漱口'，其实是为了掩饰我即将崩溃的泪水，因为他没有抱我。我被激起了欲望，渴望拥抱，他却僵住了。我以为他在拒绝我。你还记得吗？"

"My God…you are me." Asuka finally got out. Her eyes widened again. "Shit! Did he hear that?" She turned to look at… the Shinjis. They were likewise quietly talking across the tent. The new Shinji was talking, rather, and hers was staring at him as wide eyed as her.
"我的天啊…你就是我。" 明日香终于开口了。她的眼睛再次睁大。"糟糕！他听到了吗？" 她转头看向…那些真嗣们。他们也在帐篷的另一边静静地交谈着。新来的真嗣正在说话，而她的真嗣则像她一样瞪大了眼睛看着他。

"No, he didn't hear. You tell him later, after you kiss him."
不，他没听到。你晚点再告诉他，亲吻他之后。

Asuka's gaze snapped back to her double. "What?!"
明日香的目光猛地转回她的分身。"什么？！"

The other pair turned to look at her shriek. The new Shinji smiled, then turned back and resumed talking. Hers shook himself and refocused on his double.
另一对转头看向她的尖叫。新来的真嗣微笑了一下，然后转回去继续谈话。她的真嗣摇了摇头，重新集中注意力看向他的分身。

"What the Hell were you thinking?!" Asuka hissed "How could you-"
你到底是怎么想的？！" 明日香低声怒斥，"你怎么能——

Her double snorted. "A lot of things are different between Baka-Shinji and I now. Or are you going to pretend you didn't notice?" She gestured at her belly. Her face softened as the wave became a caress. Her stare was aimed far away from Asuka now, inward. "I told him... I told him because I wanted to. Because he'd just told me something I wanted to hear from him. Because he deserved to know. Because I wanted him to know. Because I…" She stopped, and looked back in Asuka's eyes. "Look, 'me', you can tell yourself whatever you want, but we both know what we were thinking. We liked it. We liked him. Don't…that's something else they told us. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Of anything. And 'you're allowed to be happy now.' Don't miss this chance."
她的分身嗤笑一声，"现在我和笨蛋真嗣之间有很多不同了。还是说你要假装没注意到？" 她指了指自己的肚子。她的表情柔和下来，原本的嘲讽变成了一种抚慰。她的目光不再盯着明日香，而是转向了内心深处。"我告诉他...我告诉他是因为我想这么做。因为他刚告诉了我一些我想从他那里听到的话。因为他有权利知道。因为我希望他知道。因为..." 她停顿了一下，然后重新看向明日香的眼睛。"听着，'我'，你可以对自己说任何你想说的话，但我们俩都知道我们当时是怎么想的。我们喜欢他。我们喜欢他。别...这是他们告诉我们的另一件事。你不必再害怕任何事了。你现在被允许快乐。别错过这个机会。"

"A month ago I took on an entire army and two Evas with nothing but a half-functioning Mass Production Unit that couldn't produce an AT-Field and the Third Child. Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything already," Asuka said disdainfully.
"一个月前，我只用了一台半功能性的量产型机体，连 AT 力场都产生不了，再加上第三适格者，就对抗了整个军队和两台 EVA。害怕？我早就不怕任何事了，" 明日香轻蔑地说。

"Right." Her double's tone became slightly mocking. "Sleeping all right? No bad dreams? No little bad moods grabbing your attention?"
是啊。" 她的分身语气略带嘲讽，"睡得好吗？没有噩梦吗？没有小情绪打扰你吗？

Asuka gave her double a nasty glare. "Shut up."
明日香向她的分身投去恶狠狠的目光。“闭嘴。”

"There's no point in telling me you're not afraid. You're me. I know what I feared. Every time I closed my eyes I'd have to relive what Arael did to me, or Zeruel tearing me apart, or Winthrop getting ready to shove into me, or see Mama…"
“告诉我你不害怕是没有意义的。你就是我。我知道我害怕什么。每次我闭上眼睛，我都不得不重温阿拉尔对我所做的事，或者塞路尔将我撕碎，或者温索普准备插入我，或者看到妈妈……”

"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" Asuka glared at herself. "I do not need to hear this!"
“闭嘴！闭嘴！闭嘴！”明日香怒视着自己。“我不需要听这些！”

Her double looked back sadly. "Yeah, you do. That's what I'm talking about. I had a lot of wounds locked up inside. He helped. So did Doctor Leibshott. So did Shinji. It's not half as bad as you think, to face it, once you know you are not alone."
她的分身悲伤地回望着。“是的，你需要。这就是我要说的。我内心锁着很多伤口。他帮助了我。莱布斯霍特医生也帮助了我。还有真嗣。面对它，一旦你知道你并不孤单，它就不像你想象的那么糟糕。”

"I can be alone! I've always been alone! I don't need anyone!" Asuka almost shouted back at her. "And I've got the Third right here anyway!" She waved angrily towards the two young men at the door.
"我可以一个人！我一直都是一个人！我不需要任何人！" 明日香几乎是对着她喊回去的。"而且我这里还有第三个人在呢！" 她生气地向门口的两个年轻人挥手。

"He may be sleeping next to you, but you know damned well you're not exactly 'together'," the pregnant Asuka retorted. "He's almost had sex with you, Hell, he's practically almost had sex at you for all you were part of it, but you've never made love together. That was part of the deal, right? He gives you everything, and you don't have to give anything back. Because I was too burned-out and soul-weary to even try anymore. And I didn't even feel worth it, deep down. But I still wanted someone to be there with me. So I wouldn't have to be alone."
他可能睡在你旁边，但你知道得很清楚，你们并不真正'在一起'，" 怀孕的明日香反驳道。"他几乎和你发生过关系，天哪，他几乎是对着你发生关系，而你几乎没有参与其中，但你们从未真正相爱过。这是交易的一部分，对吧？他给你一切，而你无需回报。因为我已经筋疲力尽，灵魂疲惫到连尝试都不想再尝试了。我甚至觉得自己不值得，内心深处。但我仍然希望有人能陪在我身边。这样我就不必孤单了。

She leaned back. "You just had that argument with him about The Time Machine, right? About going back in time to change things?
她向后靠了靠。"你刚刚不是和他争论过《时间机器》吗？关于回到过去改变事情的争论？

"Yes," Asuka replied, still angry. "It was a stupid attempt by the Third to make us go over 'what-might-have-beens' that were bad enough the first time. I don't want to have to waste time going over them again."
是的，" 明日香回答，仍然带着怒气。"那是第三个人愚蠢的尝试，想让我们重温那些第一次就够糟糕的'如果'。我不想浪费时间再去回顾它们。

"Well, now you might want to. Daniel can't…stop some things from happening that we remember happening because that would mean changing our past and we'd be someone else. But he can…change things, at least mitigate the harm. In a world with Evangelions, mitigation is wonderful. And now you'll have an army at your back, and gods on your side."
嗯，现在你可能想要这么做。丹尼尔无法……阻止一些我们记得发生过的事情，因为那意味着改变我们的过去，我们就会变成另一个人。但他可以……改变事情，至少减轻伤害。在一个有福音战士的世界里，减轻伤害是美好的。现在你将有一支军队支持你，还有众神站在你这边。

"There is no God, and he's for sure not on my side. Look at this place, does it look like 'God's In His Heaven, All's Right With The World?'" Asuka wearily quoted NERV's old motto with more than a little bitterness. "The half-starved wretches ruled by rapists and thugs are the lucky survivors."
没有上帝，而且他肯定不会站在我这边。看看这个地方，它看起来像‘上帝在他的天堂，世界一切安好吗？’" 明日香疲惫地引用 NERV 的旧口号，带着不止一点苦涩。"那些被强奸犯和暴徒统治的半饥饿的可怜人是幸运的幸存者。

"I didn't say 'God's'. I said 'gods'." Asuka looked up in confusion to see her double beginning to grin hugely. "A whole Family of them, in fact. They're really nice."
我没说‘上帝’。我说的是‘众神’。" 明日香困惑地抬头，看到她的分身开始咧嘴大笑。"实际上是一整个家族的众神。他们真的很友好。

"What are you talking about?" Asuka finally said, her brow furrowed in bewilderment.
"你在说什么？" 明日香终于说道，她的眉头因困惑而皱起。

"That's the biggest thing Daniel didn't mention, because it would sound way too crazy. He's not some 'man of wealth and power'. He's a god."
那是丹尼尔没有提及的最大问题，因为这听起来太疯狂了。他并非什么‘富有与权势之人’，他是神。

"Hi, 'me'." Shinji had barely blinked since 'he' stepped out of the portal. The greeting snapped him out of the freeze.
"嗨，‘我’。" 自从'他'从传送门中走出后，真嗣几乎没有眨过眼。这声问候让他从僵直中回过神来。

"H…how…you…" 怎…怎么…你…

Well, sort of. 算是吧。

"You're not any crazier than you were yesterday, you're not dreaming, and this isn't Instrumentality again. This is real. And yes, I'm you. Or you're me. Whatever you like. And yup, this is just as weird the second time around from this end. This is six months ago to me. Six months from now, you'll be standing on this side, watching yourself try to figure this out and saying what you're hearing." The new arrival scratched the back of his head in a mannerism Shinji found disorientingly familiar to watch from outside. "Man, he was right. This is a lot harder to make sense of in Japanese."
你并不比昨天更疯狂，你没有做梦，这也不是再次的‘人类补完计划’。这是真实的。是的，我就是你，或者你就是我，随你怎么想。没错，从这边看第二次经历同样的事情也挺诡异的。对我来说，这是六个月前。六个月后，你将站在这一边，看着自己试图弄清楚这一切，并听到你现在所听到的。"新来者挠了挠后脑勺，这个动作让真嗣从外部看起来感到异常熟悉，令人困惑。"天哪，他说的没错。用日语来理解这一切确实难多了。

"What….why are you here? 怎么…你为什么在这里？

"To convince...uh, 'us' that this is a good idea. I remember how weird this felt before, and how neither of us is really the kind to accept that this kind of out-of-nowhere offer is real. But it is. Daniel's real, he means what he said. He…gets mother's spirit out of Eva Unit-01. He gets Asuka's mother back too. Heals a lot of her wounds. Asuka, I mean. I know I tried to reach out to her, a little, after that fight with Winthrop's forces, but…you know how that went. She said she didn't love me, but I'd 'won by default'. She was with me, but she wasn't 'there'. She was still too broken up inside and hurt to let anyone in. And I was too afraid to push. He helps with that a lot. There are things Asuka and I talk about now that I'd never dreamed we would—"
为了说服...呃，'我们'相信这是个好主意。我记得之前这种感觉有多奇怪，我们俩都不是那种会轻易接受这种突如其来的提议是真实的人。但它是真的。丹尼尔是真的，他说的话是真心的。他...让母亲的精神从 Eva Unit-01 中解脱出来。他也让明日香的母亲回来了。治愈了她很多创伤。我是说明日香。我知道我试图在那次与温斯洛普势力的战斗后向她伸出援手，但...你知道那结果如何。她说她不爱我，但我'默认获胜'。她和我在一起，但她'不在那里'。她内心仍然太破碎和受伤，无法让任何人进入。而我太害怕去推动。他在这方面帮了很多。现在明日香和我谈论的事情，我从未梦想过我们会谈及——

"Was?!" 是吗？！

They both turned to look at Asuka's shriek. Shinji knew only a little German, despite years spent living with Asuka, but he knew enough for that, and it was hard to mistake the shock in her tone. The other Shinji just smiled a bit and turned back to face his present day self. "Things like that, for example. I've got a pretty good idea what my Asuka just told yours, and it's the kind of thing I wish I'd known back before the Third Impact. I might have been able to help her back then if I'd known."
他们俩都转头看向明日香的尖叫。尽管与明日香共同生活多年，真嗣只会一点点德语，但他对那句话足够了解，而且很难错认她语气中的震惊。另一个真嗣只是微微一笑，然后转回身面对现在的自己。“比如那种事情。我大概能猜到我的明日香刚刚告诉了你的什么，那是我希望在第三次冲击之前就知道的事情。如果我当时知道，或许就能帮到她。”

"What was it?" Shinji asked, his eyes still wide as saucers.
“那是什么？”真嗣问道，眼睛仍然睁得像铜铃一样大。

"Oh, Asuka will tell you when she's ready. She was even more hurt inside than I was, she's just a lot better at holding it in. …than you are, whatever. And I know how bad I felt. I blamed myself for failing to protect everyone. Asuka, Rei, Misato, Kaji...everyone in the world. But…it's not all my…your fault. You were a kid in an impossible situation, and you did well to do as much as you did."
“哦，明日香会在她准备好的时候告诉你的。她内心的伤痛甚至比我还深，只是她更擅长隐藏。……比你强，不管怎样。我知道我当时的感受有多糟。我责怪自己没能保护好大家。明日香、绫波、美里、加持……全世界的人。但是……这并不全是你的……你的错。你当时只是个孩子，面对着不可能的局面，你已经尽力了。”

"I didn't...I could have done more." Shinji looked down and to his side. "I should have done more. If I hadn't run away before the JSSDF attacked, Misato wouldn't—"
“我本可以……我本可以做得更多。”真嗣低头看向一边。“我应该做得更多。如果我在自卫队攻击前没有逃跑，美里就不会——”

"If you hadn't run away, you'd still have been stuck with Eva Unit-01 trapped in the Bakelite, and Misato would have died with everyone else in the NERV command bridge when the Third Impact hit. You'd just have been stuck in the Entry Plug instead of on the catwalk. Father was not going to let anything stop his precious Scenario, and that includes Eva Unit-01 being loose before the end. Even if they somehow managed to launch Eva Unit-01, even if you'd made it to the fight and helped Asuka, father would still have been able to trigger the Third Impact down in Terminal Dogma," The other Shinji interrupted. "Just because we were piloting the most powerful weapon on the planet, that didn't make us God. And when Rei dumped something like that power on our head in the middle of the Impact, we weren't exactly in the best state of mind to handle it. It's easy to look back now and think what we might have done differently."
如果你没有逃跑，你还会被困在巴克兰中的 EVA 初号机里，而美里也会和 NERV 指挥桥上的所有人一起在第三次冲击中丧生。你只会被困在插入栓中，而不是在走道上。父亲不会让任何事情阻止他珍视的计划，这其中也包括在结束前让 EVA 初号机失控。即使他们设法启动了 EVA 初号机，即使你赶到了战场并帮助了明日香，父亲仍然能够在中央教条区触发第三次冲击，"另一个真嗣打断道。"仅仅因为我们驾驶着地球上最强大的武器，这并不意味着我们是神。当零在冲击中将如此强大的力量倾泻在我们头上时，我们的精神状态并不适合应对。现在回顾起来，很容易想到我们本可以采取不同的行动。"

Then he grinned. "And now it's not only easy, it means something. You can trust Daniel. Go with him. He really can let you go back and make things better. Time travel is the least of what he can do." He laughed. "And doing that's almost as hard as getting Asuka to admit she really thinks I'm kind of hot sometimes."
然后他咧嘴笑了。“现在不仅变得容易，而且有了意义。你可以信任丹尼尔。跟他走吧。他真的能让你回去，让事情变得更好。时间旅行只是他能做的最基本的事情。”他笑了起来。“要做到这一点，几乎和让明日香承认她有时真的觉得我还挺帅一样难。”

"She what?" “她说什么？”

Elsewhere, five years prior...
在别处，五年前...

"Yo, aren't you late?" “喂，你不是迟到了吗？”

A pistol barked. A man fell bleeding, dying. The pair of black suited SEELE agents lowered their semi-automatics, and one who hadn't fired knelt to feel for a pulse on the neck of the man they'd just shot. He rose, nodded to his partner, and they left without a look back. The blue-armored man standing in the deep shadows off to the side in the dilapidated warehouse waited until they'd slammed the far off exit door before stepping over to look down at the ponytailed man in the pool of his own blood.
一把手枪发出咆哮。一名男子倒下，血流不止，濒临死亡。两名身着黑色西装的 SEELE 特工放下他们的半自动武器，其中未开枪的那位跪下，探查刚刚被他们击中的男子颈部的脉搏。他起身，向同伴点头示意，随后两人头也不回地离开。在破败仓库深处阴影中，一位身着蓝色装甲的男子静静等待，直到他们砰地一声关上远处的出口门，才迈步上前，低头看着那位马尾男子躺在自己的血泊中。

"Idiot. Death-seeking idiot. Do you have any idea how many people you just disappointed by standing there like that?" He sighed. "I guess you are 'late' now, eh? All right, on your feet, look alive!"
蠢货。寻求死亡的蠢货。你可知道，就因为你那样站着，有多少人会感到失望？" 他叹了口气。"看来你现在是真的'迟到'了，嗯？好吧，站起来，振作点！

Nothing. 无。

"And here I am, punning at a dead guy. Oh well, work work work..." He crouched down and placed his hand on the dead man's chest. He closed his eyes, and the air went still. The pool of blood stopped spreading, then began to retreat. The scent of blood and gun smoke faded, and the air began to smell of ozone.
"而我，竟然在死人面前开玩笑。唉，工作工作工作……" 他蹲下身，将手放在死者的胸口。他闭上眼睛，空气顿时凝固。血泊停止扩散，随后开始回缩。血腥味和枪烟味消散，空气中开始弥漫着臭氧的气息。

The dead man gasped and blinked his eyes open again. "Hunh,...ah...ahh. Ungh...wha...what?" He slowly rolled over and sat up, hands patting at his chest, and stopping to poke a finger through the distinct bullet hole in his still bloody shirt. And feeling around on his skin underneath the hole to very definitely not find a matching hole in his skin. His eyes finally noted the pair of armored feet next to him, and travelled up to meet the blue eyes staring back down at him.
那个死去的人喘着气，再次眨眼睁开了眼睛。“呃……啊……啊。嗯……什……什么？”他慢慢地翻身坐起，双手拍打着胸口，停下时用手指戳了戳血迹斑斑的衬衫上明显的弹孔。在弹孔下的皮肤上摸索，却明显没有找到对应的伤口。他的目光最终注意到身旁那双装甲靴，顺着向上看去，与俯视他的蓝眼睛相遇。

"Hi! Can I interest you in a really fine set of encyclopedias? It's a little late to sell you life insurance," the stranger greeted him cheerfully.
“嗨！您有兴趣购买一套精美的百科全书吗？现在向您推销人寿保险有点晚了，”陌生人兴高采烈地向他打招呼。

"What? Who are you? What just happened to me? They shot me, and...and? What?" The no longer dead man trailed off in total confusion. He looked back down at his bloody shirt, then back up, still at a loss.
“什么？你是谁？我刚刚经历了什么？他们向我开枪，然后……然后？什么？”这个不再死去的人完全困惑了。他低头看了看自己血迹斑斑的衬衫，然后又抬头，依旧茫然。

"They shot you, you died. This is what comes after. You've been judged, and found deserving," the armored man intoned solemnly. He stuck his hand down to the man. "On your feet, Kaji-san."
“他们向你开枪，你死了。这就是之后的事情。你已经被审判，并被判定为值得。”装甲男子庄重地说道。他伸出手给那人。“站起来，Kaji 先生。”

Kaji Ryoji took his hand and hauled himself up. He looked around in confusion. "So, I'm dead? This is the afterlife?"
加治良治握住他的手，用力将自己拉起来。他困惑地环顾四周，心想：“所以，我死了吗？这里是死后世界？”

"While I could probably get hours of entertainment out of messing with your head on that note; no. Most people hope to see their God or somesuch after they die. You got luckier and got me instead. My name's Daniel. And I take that 'luckier' part back. You're going to have to face something worse than all the tortures of Hell on our next stop."
“虽然我可能可以从捉弄你的思绪中获得数小时的乐趣；但不是的。大多数人死后都希望能见到他们的神或其他什么。你运气更好，遇见了我。我叫丹尼尔。不过，我要收回那句‘运气更好’的话。接下来你得面对比地狱所有折磨还要糟糕的东西。”

"...the Third Impact? The end of the world? ...Commander Ikari coming on to me?"
“……第三次冲击？世界末日？……还是碇司令向我表白？”

"Your pissed off ex-ex-girlfriend." He snapped his fingers, and the warehouse was empty of movement save the whirling vent fan.
“你那愤怒的前前女友。”他打了个响指，仓库里除了旋转的通风扇外，再无其他动静。

In a tent on the shore, a pair of identical exchanges was underway.
在岸边的帐篷里，一对完全相同的交换正在进行中。

"Seriously?" 真的吗？

"Yes." 是的。

"...Bullshit." ...胡说。

"No, seriously, it's true."
不，说真的，这是真的。

"Right, sure. In those exact words, that's what you've heard?"
对，当然。你听到的就是这些确切的词吗？

"Ask Daniel. He'll confirm it."
问问丹尼尔。他会证实的。

Eventually, divergence. 最终，分歧。

"So he's going to heal the sick, raise the dead, and feed us all with a few loaves and fishes?" Asuka asked, voice dripping with sarcasm.
"所以他打算治愈病人，复活死者，用几块面包和几条鱼喂饱我们所有人？" 明日香问道，语气中充满了讽刺。

"As a matter of fact, yes." Her double's grin sharpened. "Though that 'loaves and fishes' part may have been just for you saying that." She held out her right arm. "Notice anything missing?"
事实上，是的。" 她的分身笑容更加锐利。"虽然那个'面包和鱼'的部分可能只是因为你这么说。" 她伸出右臂。"注意到有什么不见了吗？

Asuka stared, at first seeing nothing. "I don't...wait. No scar?" She looked up.
明日香盯着看，一开始什么也没发现。"我没...等等。没有疤痕？" 她抬头看去。

"Yes! They healed up all those little leftover scars from fighting the Mass Production Evas, took care of the bullet scar from the coup, and gave me a full once-over on nerves and bones. I'm as healthy as I can possibly be, and undamaged, intact everywhere." She giggled for some reason. "Well, not intact everywhere. And raising the dead? Heh. Mama's just the beginning. But if you don't come along, you'll never know." Her double stared the dare at her and waited.
"是的！他们治愈了所有那些与量产型 EVA 战斗留下的微小疤痕，处理了政变中的子弹疤痕，并对我的神经和骨骼进行了全面检查。我尽可能地健康，全身完好无损。" 她不知为何咯咯笑了起来。"好吧，并不是全身都完好无损。至于复活死者？呵呵。妈妈只是开始。但如果你不加入，你永远不会知道。" 她的分身用挑战的眼神盯着她，等待着。

"...you are low, nasty bitch. Alright, I'll go." Asuka looked over at the other pair. "And I bet the Third is just jumping to go, the idiot."
...你真是个低贱的贱人。好吧，我走。" 明日香看向另一对。"我敢打赌，第三个家伙肯定迫不及待要去，那个白痴。

"She told you she thinks I'm hot? Are we talking about the same Asuka?"
她告诉你她觉得我很性感？我们说的是同一个明日香吗？

"Come with us, or you may never know." The other Shinji smiled. "I know she's going to go. For the chance to get her mother back, Asuka would definitely go for it." His smile faded. "And this will also give you a chance to make a lot of things right."
跟我们来，否则你可能永远都不会知道。" 另一个真嗣微笑着说。"我知道她会去的。为了有机会找回她的母亲，明日香肯定会去。" 他的笑容消失了。"这也给你一个机会，去纠正很多事情。

"Like what?" Shinji asked quietly
"比如什么？" 真嗣轻声问道

"Like everything I held myself responsible for. Misato, Kaji, not being there for Asuka when she needed me. More, but I'm not supposed to ruin a lot of happy surprises. But I'm betting you can guess at least one." He looked over at the Asuka in the flowing red dress and smiled tenderly.
"就像我对所有事情都自责一样。对美里、加持，还有在明日香需要我时没能陪在她身边。还有更多，但我不能破坏太多惊喜。但我相信你至少能猜到一个。" 他看向穿着飘逸红裙的明日香，温柔地笑了。

Shinji looked at her more closely himself. Her leaning back made it even more apparent.
真嗣自己也更加仔细地打量着她。她向后靠的姿势让情况更加明显。

"Is she..." 她是...

"Yes." 是的。

"...how?" ...怎么回事？

"You see, when a man and a woman love each othe—"
你看，当一个男人和一个女人彼此相爱时——

Shinji flushed bright red. "That's not what I mean!"
真嗣的脸涨得通红。"我不是那个意思！"

"I know, I just couldn't resist." The other Shinji chuckled. "How? All I'm supposed to say is 'Be honest, be there for her, and don't be afraid.' Remember the Fifth Angel? 'Aim for the center, and pull the trigger'? Just like that, focus on what you really want, and follow through. Remember all those times back in Misato's apartment when you wanted to do something to help her, and do it, even if she pushes you away. Because in the end, she was afraid that I'd abandon her like everyone else in her life had. She needed to know I'll never leave her." He looked back at Shinji. "'I mustn't run away,' right? I was...you were ready to take all the risk in that coup to protect her. Now you just have to be ready to face her and your own fears. Willing to try?"
我知道，我只是忍不住。"另一个真嗣轻笑道，"怎么？我应该说的只是'要诚实，要陪伴她，不要害怕。'还记得第五使徒吗？'瞄准中心，扣动扳机'？就像那样，专注于你真正想要的，并付诸行动。记得在美里小姐的公寓里，有多少次你想做些什么来帮助她，那就去做，即使她推开你。因为最终，她害怕我会像她生命中的其他人一样抛弃她。她需要知道我永远不会离开她。"他回头看着真嗣，"'我不能逃避'，对吧？我...你已经准备好承担那次政变中的所有风险来保护她。现在你只需要准备好面对她和你自己的恐惧。愿意尝试吗？

Shinji took a couple of deep breaths. "I mustn't run away. Right. If she's going, I'm going too." His right hand flexed and released, flexed and released.
真嗣深吸了几口气。“我不能逃跑。对，如果她要去，我也去。”他的右手一紧一松，一紧一松。

The pair of newcomers looked at each other. New-Shinji nodded, and they stepped back towards each other. Their hands met, and they folded smoothly into a close embrace, their heads on each other's shoulders, eyes closed. Shinji flushed again at the sight of an image from too many wistful dreams come to life in front of him. He dared a glance over at the redhead still sitting up in her sleeping bag. She was staring as well, the look on her face half aching, half angry. She glared at Shinji for a moment when she noticed him looking at her, then stood up muttering, and began to pull on a dress and shoes.
两位新来者对视一眼。新真嗣点头，他们便向后退去，彼此靠近。双手相触，他们流畅地拥入一个紧密的怀抱，头靠在对方肩上，双眼紧闭。真嗣看到这幅画面，心中涌起无数渴望梦境成真的激动，脸颊再次泛红。他鼓起勇气瞥了一眼仍在睡袋中坐着的红发女孩。她也正凝视着，脸上的表情半是痛苦，半是愤怒。注意到真嗣的目光，她瞪了他一眼，然后站起身来，嘴里嘟囔着，开始穿上裙子和鞋子。

Daniel's sudden reappearance in the tent broke the slightly awkward silence. All four jumped as he abruptly was standing right where he'd been before. "And we're back, ladies and gentlemen. Who's ready to see the other side of the multiverse?"
丹尼尔突然回到帐篷中，打破了略显尴尬的沉默。他突然出现在原来的位置，四人都吓了一跳。“女士们先生们，我们回来了。谁准备好去看看多元宇宙的另一面了？”

The hugging pair looked at each other, then softly kissed before turning to face him. "All set here." The pregnant Asuka looked over at her double, who was stuffing clothes into a backpack. "Oh, don't worry about that, 'me'. This trip's 'all-inclusive'. You don't have this dress yet, yes?" She flared the skirt out with her left hand. Her right never left her Shinji's touch.
拥抱的两人对视一眼，然后轻吻一下，转身面对他。"这里都准备好了。"怀孕的明日香看向她的分身，后者正往背包里塞衣服。"哦，别担心那个，'我'。这次旅行是'全包'的。你还没有这件裙子，对吧？"她用左手展开裙摆。她的右手始终没有离开她的真嗣。

Asuka opened her mouth to make a sharp retort. The she stiffened, her mouth hanging half open in shock again. For the first time there was enough light on her doppelg?nger's hand for her to see it. There was a tiny sparkle of light on the third finger of her left hand. "Impossible..." was all she managed, a bare whisper.
明日香张开嘴想要尖锐地反驳。接着她僵住了，嘴巴半张着再次陷入震惊。这是她第一次有足够的光线照在她分身的手上，让她能看清楚。她左手的无名指上有一小点闪光。"不可能……"她只能发出微弱的低语。

Her double noticed her paralysis. She flicked her eyes at her Shinji and winked. Asuka felt dizzy, then shook herself. 'I am not going to pass out, damn it!' Anger was always close to hand to help block out thinking of such... madness. She stood up and walked over. "Fine!" she bit out. "Let's go, then!" She glared at Daniel, then looked over at the boy still standing by the tent door. "Come on, Third!"
她的分身注意到了她的僵硬。她朝她的真嗣眨了眨眼。明日香感到一阵眩晕，然后摇了摇头。'我绝不会晕倒，该死！'愤怒总是近在咫尺，帮助她屏蔽掉思考这种……疯狂的事情。她站起来走了过去。"好吧！"她咬牙说道。"那我们走吧！"她瞪了丹尼尔一眼，然后看向还站在帐篷门口的男孩。"快点，第三！"

Daniel snapped his fingers once more, and the golden portal flared open. He nodded at the two that had come through with him. "You two first."
丹尼尔再次打了个响指，金色传送门随之闪耀开启。他向与他一同过来的两人点头示意，“你们先请。”

They stepped through, and vanished into the light. Daniel looked at Asuka and Shinji. "Alright, kids, follow me." He stepped into the light himself.
他们踏入其中，消失在光芒之中。丹尼尔看向明日香和真嗣，“好了，孩子们，跟我来。”他自己也迈入了光芒。

Shinji nervously glanced at Asuka. She was staring fixedly at the glowing portal.
真嗣紧张地瞥了一眼明日香，她正目不转睛地盯着那闪烁的传送门。

"Let's go, Third." “我们走吧，第三适格者。”

Shinji made a tentative motion to take her hand, but she was already stepping forward.
真嗣试探性地伸手去牵她的手，但她已经向前迈步了。

Shinji followed after her.
真嗣跟在她后面。

### Chapter 02 欢迎来到阿瓦隆

真嗣盲目地走进了光中，穿了过去。当他踏入时，皮肤上有一种微弱的刺痛感，随后很快又被黑暗几乎再次致盲。他撞上了一团散发着草莓香脂气息的头发，立刻通过熟悉的香味辨认出那是明日香那浓密的长发。他用力眨眼，向她的右边迈步，嘴巴张开想要再次道歉，但他的眼睛适应得足够快，发现明日香甚至根本没有注意到他撞到了她。她正仰望着天空，下巴张开，满是敬畏。真嗣抬头望去。

星条旗点缀的夜空璀璨夺目。三道巨大的弧线相隔几度，从地平线横跨至另一端，宛如从高空俯瞰地球的切片，日光照耀下的绿蓝交错，与对应的阴影轮廓交相辉映，轮廓中闪烁着城市灯光，犹如地球的夜面。这三道拱门似乎在天顶附近汇聚，将天空分割成多个区域，每个区域中至少漂浮着十几个卫星。它们都是云雾缭绕的蓝白地球状星球。无数灯光穿梭其间，必是飞船无疑。这一切背景是一片巨大的蓝绿星云，点缀着比地球夜空中最密集的银河部分还要多的星星。

真嗣这才明白为何明日香甚至没注意到他走进来。他不知道自己在明日香身边站了多久，凝视着天空。一声欢呼终于将他从这令人目眩神迷的景象中拉回现实。

欢迎，我的朋友们，来到这永远胜利的英雄之地，光辉之境，我的家园！" 丹尼尔欢快地说道，他挥手划过天际，笑容满面。"欢迎来到阿瓦隆！

"我觉得我需要坐下来。" 明日香虚弱地说。真嗣木然地点了点头。坐下来，这听起来是个不错的主意。哦，她指的是她自己。他终于环顾了一下四周。

他们身处一片海滩，小浪轻轻拍打着几米开外的平坦沙滩。棕榈树散布在他面前，部分遮挡了一座被更多热带植物环绕的简朴海滨小屋。岛屿在房屋后方延伸，他能看到远处其他建筑的灯光。幸运的是，为了满足他当前的需求，在他左边离沙滩不远处有一套沙滩椅和一张带伞的桌子。他牵起明日香的手，领着她顺从地坐到其中一把椅子上，然后自己也坐了下来。

另一对站在丹尼尔旁边的海滩上。另一个明日香似乎觉得她对应者的震惊状态很有趣。“喂！我们要回到我们该在的时候了。有人在等我们参加派对！你们玩得开心。试试这个，'我'；是他问你了吗？还是你问他了？”她喊道。另一个真嗣挥了挥手。“记住，你可以改变事情。抓住机会！待会儿见！”他们身后的空中出现了一个苍白的灰色圆盘。他们和丹尼尔交谈了一分钟。真嗣因为海浪声和距离听不见任何声音。他们手牵手穿过新出现的传送门，然后消失了。

真嗣咀嚼着这句话，一时无言，他看向明日香。“她在说什么？”

明日香仍然盯着传送门曾经所在的海滩。“我不想谈论这个，第三。”

有人在他们身后轻轻咳嗽了一声。真嗣和明日香转过身去。一个身穿太空黑制服的苗条亚洲年轻女子站在他们的桌子后面。她优雅地鞠了一躬，并向他们微笑。

"晚上好，碇先生，索龙小姐。我是蓝青浩飞行中队的少尉。陛下让我在你们逗留期间担任你们的同伴和向导。"她微微侧头，注意到他们略显疲惫的神态。"需要我给你们拿点喝的吗？你们看起来可能需要。"她的日语是标准的东京标准语。

"嗯，是的，请给我茶。" 真嗣勉强说道。

"白兰地。" 明日香厉声说道，然后揉了揉鼻梁，用德语低声嘀咕。

请给我一杯 12 年的图拉摩尔戴夫加冰，少尉，"丹尼尔说着，拉出另一把椅子坐下。"给自己也拿点什么，请加入我们。

"是的，陛下。"她再次鞠躬，然后走进了海滨别墅。

"'陛下'？"真嗣问道。

丹尼尔再次咧嘴笑道："我说的是'财富与权力'，碇先生。我没有详细说明，我承认。这是我的家园...世界。欢迎来到我的王国首都。阿瓦隆帝国。"

我看到了分身，人们凭空出现，现在一个魔法王国的皇帝想要满足我的愿望。"明日香用紧张的声音说道，她把头埋在手里，手肘撑在桌子上。"我因为你的大提琴演奏而睡着了，现在我正在经历一生中最奇怪的梦。这是唯一合理的解释。

'天地间有许多奇事，哈姆雷特，远超你的哲学所能梦见，'丹尼尔引用道，'既然你在做梦，何不放松享受一番？若这是现实，那就接受奇妙之事已闯入你的生活。就像突然被召唤去驾驶对抗来自另一个世界的'天使'的巨型机甲，不是吗？啊，谢谢你，中尉。'

莱布施托中尉将一个圆形的陶瓷茶杯和三个半满的玻璃杯放在桌上，然后坐下最后一张椅子。"当然，陛下。能为您服务是我的荣幸。"

像这样的双关语会让你升职，也可能被流放到南极洲。干杯！"丹尼尔举起杯子，抿了一口。"啊，非常不错。那么！"他直视着明日香的双眼。"我注意到我刚到时你迅速环顾四周的眼神，碇真嗣小姐。让我做一个希望能让你更自在的手势。看这里。"他拉了拉右大腿，掏出一把手枪、枪套和腰带。他在手中旋转了一下，然后轻轻放在桌上，枪柄朝向明日香。"这是我的一件古董武器。如果手边有枪让你感觉不那么脆弱，尽管拿去用，用多久都行。这是一把基础款的 M1911，老式美国政府.45 口径，略有升级。比如，你永远不需要给它换弹，因为弹匣内部比外部大得多。里面大约有两百万发子弹。请不要将枪口对准任何你不真心想伤害的东西。它已经上膛并装弹了。"

真嗣端着茶杯停在唇边，僵住了。明日香警惕地看着那把枪。她的目光转向了平静等待她反应的丹尼尔。她缓缓伸手去拿枪，将其拉到桌边。她抬头看向丹尼尔，脸上是一副难以捉摸的表情。

丹尼尔回以同样难以捉摸的表情，然后向那位身穿紧身黑制服的女性挥了挥手。“莱布肖特中尉因病从帝国海军休假。这位好中尉因为另一个宇宙的敌对登陆行动中受伤，作为客人来到这里。我们的治疗师让她恢复了健康，但她仍需要一些休息时间来适应她重建的身体。这让她恰好能在这里帮助你们两位，我已请求她在她在这里的时候在各种能力范围内协助，比如她的精神病学博士学位。叫她医生、中尉或她喜欢的任何称呼，但她不是来当你们的医生的。她在这里是为了在我不在的时候成为朋友和向导，恐怕我会间歇性地不在。但你们在这里无需有任何担忧。”

他挥臂指向他们身后的岛屿其余部分，说道：“你们现在正坐在星座群岛之一，这是一个结合了临终关怀和度假村的地方，专为那些需要远离带来伤害的一切、寻求休息和恢复的人而设。而你们两位无疑赢得了这份宁静。我们距离任何可能打扰你们的地方都有数千英里之遥。从这里能看到的其他岛屿和木屋，要么是其他同样在恢复中的人，要么就是空置的。”

帝国海军在轨道上及整个星系中保持着持续的存在，任何试图接近行星的人都将不得不面对帝国卫队，他们会非常不悦有人试图打扰我们的客人。简而言之，未经你的允许，没有人会在这里打扰你，你的安全保护程度是你从未有过的。

真嗣心中有太多疑问，不知从何问起。他看向明日香，但她正大口喝着她的烈酒。无论她的分身说了什么，显然都让她心情恶劣。最后那句话？问了什么？真嗣微微摇头。那个以后再担心。“陛下，我们为什么在这里？”

你们作为我的私人宾客来到这里，碇君，并非作为臣民或向皇冠祈求的外国使者。请叫我丹尼尔。至于原因，最直接的是你们俩确实需要一次全面体检，一点宁静和休息，以及一些独处的时间。这将给我们机会更详细地讨论你们的需求，尽管今晚在你们各自休息之前，我想先了解一下基本情况。既然这些自然都是你们心中所愿，如果你们不介意的话，我想单独与你们交谈。

真嗣犹豫了一下；这并不是他问题的本意，但还是点了点头。经过稍长时间的犹豫后，明日香也点了点头。

丹尼尔喝完了最后一口饮料，站起身来。"那么，就这样吧。中尉，请带索龙小姐参观一下他们的舱室设施。碇君，请你陪我走几分钟好吗？"他向后退了几步，朝着海浪的方向。

真嗣站起身，跟随他沿着海滩走去。

### Chapter 02.1 第三适格者的遗憾

他们沉默地走了几分钟。真嗣的脑海里仍然充斥着太多疑问，他的目光不断飘向那令人分心的壮观天空。最终，他选择了惯常的低头走路姿势，以免自己只是呆望着天空。

让我猜猜，碇君。你还在试图确定自己是否真的相信这一切正在发生，甚至不知道该从何问起吧？

嗯，请叫我真嗣，您...嗯，丹尼尔。如果...嗯...这是我至少能做的。

丹尼尔微笑着说：“真嗣，我很荣幸能这样称呼你。认识你让我感到自豪。”

真嗣抬起头，奇怪地盯着他。“我？”

丹尼尔点头道：“我对政变前几天的情况相当了解，还有我接你那天的对话。看到明日香因为你一再冒险被逮捕、审讯，甚至更糟，只为给那些你明知多半是陷入国家恐怖机器的无辜穷人提供金钱、援助和保护而对你大发雷霆...我总是为认识像你这样的人而感到骄傲，真嗣。那些不顾危险，坚持做正确事情的英雄。”

真嗣再次低头看向自己的脚。他总是觉得被表扬很尴尬，尽管内心对此感到欣喜，因为这种情况对他来说太少见了。当他觉得自己只是做了应该做的事情却被表扬时，这种不适感更是被放大了。“我……我做不到……对那种事情视而不见。我不喜欢看到别人受伤，尤其是当我能做些什么的时候。明日香可能说得对，我只会给我们带来麻烦，但是……我做不到……”

丹尼尔转过头来直视着他。“我完全明白你的意思。我们所有人，”他指向天空，“整个帝国，这就是我们的使命。不再逃避。永远做正确的事。这就是我为你感到骄傲的原因，真嗣。我这么做，背后有整个帝国的支持。而你在全球性灾难的余波中，面对压迫和死亡，仅凭自己的正义感和一点零花钱就做到了。”

真嗣耸了耸肩，依旧低着头。“我不得不这么做。”

我也是。" 丹尼尔停顿了一下。 "我对于与使徒战斗中的事情，以及从第二次冲击到第三次冲击期间的一些事件，了解得相当多。我知道你有遗憾，对于你做过或未做的事情，或者对于你觉得自己辜负了的人。所以，真嗣，你想从哪里开始让事情变得更好呢？

真嗣试图整理自己的思绪。 "我...那个...我与之交谈的真嗣，那是来自未来的'我'吗？"

丹尼尔再次点头。 "是的，大约在你个人时间线上的六个月后。我知道要说服你跟随一个突然冒出来的陌生人很难，所以我确保带上了'你们自己'。"

他...提到了...我母亲的精神，在 EVA 初号机里？还有...还有美里，和加持..." 他的声音渐渐低至几乎听不见 "...绫波？渚薰？

某种特定的恐怖，即只有通过吸收人类灵魂才能激活福音战士，是的。我确信我能从 Eva 初号机中取出你母亲的灵魂。它在第三次冲击后随着朗基努斯之枪漂离地球。这为我们提供了一个相当接近的空间区域来寻找它，一旦我们找到它，我就能轻松地提取她的灵魂。当我们回到你的世界时，我会从第三次冲击开始进行分子洞回溯。葛城小姐和加持先生？不难。我可以从他本应死亡的时刻将他带到现在。葛城少校，我得从灵魂之环中提取，因为她是在死亡前被拉入人类补完计划的。绫波小姐……嗯。"他闭上眼睛片刻。"我需要到那里再做进一步检查。我不确定，因为她不仅仅是被卷入了第三次冲击，她还是其中的一部分。她那半天使的本质可能会使事情变得棘手。此外，我还不能确定你的梦境是否真的是她在与你对话，或者只是愿望驱使的幻觉。

真嗣正要开口，突然眼睛瞪大了。"等等，你怎么知道我梦见了什么？"

只是那些涉及绫波小姐与你交谈的部分。'如何'这个问题解释起来很复杂，今晚我不想深究。但你在哲学上的研究或许会在我解释时派上用场。'先有鸡还是先有蛋的因果困境'甚至不足以涵盖它。但我不在你的脑海里。我承诺过。

 但那又是怎么回事...？

我觉得这并不能让你安心..."他犹豫了一下。真嗣示意他继续说下去。"但简而言之...唉，根本就没有简短的版本。想象一下，有一个无限的图书馆，里面记录着每个世界中的每一个故事。假设我拿起了一个你写的关于政变前后日子的故事。我会知道你做了什么，你的想法，以及你在梦里看到了什么。但仅限于你写下来的内容，所以我不会知道你没看到的事情，或者你没允许自己去思考的事情，等等。我读了你的故事，并决定你和明日香不应该那样结束。于是我追溯了故事的来源，并打开了一个通往你帐篷的传送门。这就是我所说的我能到达的最早时间。这确实是真的。那就是你的'故事'结束的地方。

他看着真嗣明显的困惑表情。"我确实告诉过你，这不会让你安心。"

"嗯。" 真嗣再次摇了摇头。他以为自己之前已经有很多疑问了。

"但我之前说的仍然有效。到了那里我会尽力帮助绫波，并确定你的梦境是真实的，还是仅仅是一个愿望。无论哪种情况，我都会尽我所能让她回来，如果她愿意的话。" 他深吸了一口气，然后叹息。

渚薰……更复杂。他有一半以上是使徒，从某种意义上说，他也是你的敌人，但同时也是你的朋友。他确实试图终结你的世界，如果不是绫波在你到达之前阻止了他，他本可以做到的。真嗣，你是一名士兵。你被征召入了一场只能以人类的灭绝或使徒的灭亡告终的战争。有时在战争中，你会喜欢上对立面的人。这是对你极其残酷的要求，但为了人类的生存却是必要的……我很抱歉，你不得不在如此年轻的时候，在已经被其他使徒所造成的伤害之后，面对这样的选择……

丹尼尔的声音因愤怒而变得沙哑。"你的父亲是疯狂的。让你们这些孩子承受如此痛苦，在彻底的孤立中坚持下去...这无疑是通往疯狂的捷径。我在一个又一个世界中目睹了这一点。没有支持网络，没有与他人的联系，即使是再坚强的战士也可能崩溃成疯狂和绝望。我们绝不会让任何人在这里独自面对这一切。帝国军队的座右铭是'永不孤单。我们始终是军团'，即使我们独自一人，也从不感到孤独，因为我们知道有其他人陪伴着我们，与我们相连。"

他摇了摇头，让愤怒消退。"对你要求得太多了，真嗣。但现在我可以尝试确保你得到尽可能多的回报。我会看看是否有办法至少让你有机会与渚先生交谈，当我们为寻找绫波而搜索灵魂之环时。"

"我...我想这就是我能要求的全部了。"真嗣的声音很轻，他的眼神遥远，迷失在痛苦的回忆中。

"关于那个特定话题，确实如此。你现在拥有巨大的力量和选择权。你可以有更大的梦想，真嗣。"丹尼尔温和地说。

 更大？

仍有许多人被困在第三次冲击的灵魂之环中。您希望我尝试将他们全部救出吗？当我们尝试与绫波小姐交谈时，我或许能了解这一行动的可行性。如果他们只是因为缺乏意识或意愿而被困，我应该能够使他们实体化。关于您和她即将出发的远征军，我知道您不想杀人，但您同意了明日香关于使用 EVA 比常规战争更能减少伤亡的合理观点。我可以确保一个帝国陆军师与我们一同返回。我的士兵在技术上比 EVA 对常规部队的优势还要大。他们可以帮助您迅速结束地球上的所有战斗，并在重建工作中提供帮助。我们能帮助您恢复整个世界。

真嗣感到异常麻木，头脑嗡嗡作响。太多，太快。这么多遗憾真的有可能如此轻易地得到弥补吗？当丹尼尔将手臂搭在他的肩膀上时，他吓了一跳。他抬头看向丹尼尔，后者正关切地注视着他。

你看起来真的很需要一个拥抱，真嗣。我决定来帮助你和明日香，部分原因是你们俩经历了太多。如果你们不是那么孤独无助，至少可以减轻多少痛苦？你和她，你们为了保护这个世界战斗得如此艰难，承受了那么多，尽管团队和指挥都严重失灵...你们都值得更好的。你应该得到幸福。

"这就是我在第三次冲击后选择脱离人类补完计划的原因。我意识到我可以这么做。第三次冲击后的世界并没有提供太多机会。有时我在想，我是否做出了正确的选择，"真嗣若有所思地说。

我认为你做的是对的。人类真的不适合作为一个没有自我界限的集体意识存在。尽管冲击后的世界充满了残酷，但至少它还是人类的世界。如果你没有做出这个选择，就不会再有任何选择的机会。每个人都将只是单一集体意识的一部分，无法对外界采取任何行动。那里甚至不可能有幸福，只有存在。

他回头望向真嗣，脸上露出一抹微笑。“如果你能从中获得更多实质性的好处，你可能会对此更有信心。那么，你自己的幸福呢，真嗣？在这方面我能帮上什么忙吗？我明白你希望明日香能对你更加敞开心扉。你们目前的‘安排’几乎比孤独还要糟糕。她就在你身边，但情感上却相隔万里。这几乎和没有她一样糟糕。”

真嗣感到心口一阵刺痛，伴随着熟悉的忧郁。明日香。自从温斯洛的命令将他们分开后，他每天都在想念她。尽管在柏林她的公寓里他曾对她说过那些话，但他从未完全放弃过希望，期待有一天能再次凝视那位异国风情的美艳红发女子，并看到她回以微笑。她是唯一一个让他想要走出自己惯常的孤僻、隔离外壳的人。那个与他并肩作战，自彩虹之上相遇那天起就出现在他梦中的人，甚至在人类补完计划的深渊中，他都恳求她伸出手来帮他分担痛苦。然而她依旧拒绝了他，当他在海滩上醒来，躺在她身边时，那份痛苦太过沉重，他几乎失去理智地开始掐住她。

然而，她曾轻抚他的脸颊，如此温柔。仅是指尖的轻触。她的关切，如羽毛般轻盈。那一刻，他崩溃了，伏在她身上，痛哭流涕。他们本可以交谈，彼此敞开心扉。但在人类补完计划中，直视彼此及所有人心灵的景象过于赤裸，审视内心幻象的严酷使他们比以往更害怕讨论。他渴望与她交谈，但每次鼓起勇气尝试时，害怕再次受伤的恐惧便将他吞噬。在人们逐渐从灵魂之海中苏醒的六个月混乱初期，他几次几乎试图与明日香谈论所见所闻。他有时希望她能开口，免去他寻找勇气的负担。但明日香已支离破碎，她拒绝交谈。他们的铁律形成：绝不提及第三次冲击。她甚至连续几天都不愿看他一眼。

随后，第一位新军阀找到了他们。真嗣竭尽全力让他们活下去。明日香似乎有一半时间不在乎他们是生是死，所以这全是他的责任。数月来睡在冰冷的牢房里，几乎不吃东西，永远不知道是否还能见到新的一天。只有他们作为世界上唯一的福音战士驾驶员的潜在价值，才使他们免于被当场枪决。温思罗普恢复了一定程度的稳定，但对真嗣来说，却从难以忍受变成了噩梦。

温思罗普最终告诉他，明日香不会被简单地扔给他的手下当另一个妾，而是她已经“自愿”接受他的个人关注。当他宣布这一点时，绝望中的真嗣试图提出自己作为替代。温思罗普嘲笑了他，并让他的警卫将真嗣打昏。第二天，他们就把真嗣留在了波士顿，让他远离柏林、明日香和他自己。那已经是真嗣三年多来最后一次见到他们中的任何一个人，直到他们召他回来驾驶剩余的修复量产型福音战士。

他试图不在流亡期间让对自己未能保护任何他所关心之人的最终失败的持续沉思吞噬自己。出于同情，他给了街头饥饿的老人一些食物，但得知老人曾是哲学教授后，便请他担任导师。关于心灵和身份本质的深奥理论帮助他理解了在人类补完计划中的经历……并让他不再每时每刻想起她。

当他终于飞回柏林，看到她在停机坪上等候时，仿佛他从未离开过。她更高挑、曲线更美，甚至更加迷人，她的声音依旧尖锐，眼神中依旧充满恼怒……当它们不充满冷酷、苦涩的痛苦时。她对待他的方式与他们在美里公寓生活时如出一辙。考虑到他们所经历的一切，这本应有所改变。现在她的言行更加尖锐，将在人类补完计划中学到的知识如他在医院床上对她所做的那样抛向他，但变化还不够。因此，真嗣比以往任何时候都更清楚，这一定是一副面具。

他们俩依然带着同样的伤痕。当他在柔道比赛中短暂地将她压制，她随即反击令他窒息昏迷的那一刻，两人都僵住了……那些过于鲜活的记忆，如同在血色海水中的沙滩上醒来。她在政变前试图在浴缸中溺水自尽。她对他救她一命的干预充满怨恨。总是这样。每当他试图接近她，她要么推开他，要么伤害他。“世界上仍有无数女孩躺在医院病床上。”该死。她用他曾伤害过她的事情来伤害他，就这样，永远永远，阿门。

在政变中与被 Dummy Plug 控制的 EVA 战斗后，他终于鼓起勇气问她对他的感觉。她说她不爱他。但她的声音听起来如此疲惫，最终还是向他屈服了。'屈服'这个词恰如其分。这远非他五年来梦寐以求的喜悦胜利。恰恰相反，它感觉就像一个充满裂缝的陶俑，只等最后一击便支离破碎。

搭在真嗣肩上的手臂再次紧了紧。“嘿，真嗣，在亚法隆我们不谈绝望。我看得出你的表情。我们可以帮忙。我知道你在那场战斗后问过她，她是否爱你，对吧？”他停顿了一下。真嗣勉强地点了点头。“但你没有反过来问过吗？你有没有直接告诉过她你对她的感情？”

真嗣闭上了眼睛。“没有。过去四年里我们大部分时间都是分开的。”“我害怕。”“而在第三次冲击之后，情况就……很困难。”

丹尼尔轻声笑了起来。“我本想叫你胆小鬼，但我知道你的感受。让我给你讲个关于我如何遇见我妻子的故事。”他的手臂终于从真嗣的肩膀上移开，举起左手，向真嗣展示了一枚磨损严重的银色戒指，中间镶着金带。“很久很久以前，在我成为皇帝、旅行者或任何其他身份之前，我是一名士兵。我在战时入伍，我知道自己将面临什么，但我并不害怕。我上了战场，被枪击过数百次。有一次，我勉强躲过了一枚火箭弹，最终带着国家颁发的战斗伤痕勋章回家。我在战区两次重新入伍，完成了五次轮换。多年的战火洗礼让我明白，我几乎无所畏惧……”

他的双手故作紧张地摆弄着。"...除了穿过拥挤的舞池去邀请那位极其美丽的红发女子共舞。"他嗤笑一声。"我算什么'英雄'。不怕子弹和炸弹，只怕鼓起勇气走向一个漂亮女孩与她交谈。幸好有位战友及时给了我一个鼓舞人心的推搡，否则我永远不会遇到我将要娶的女人。所以我不会说你没告诉她是错的。我只想问，经历了这一切之后，你是否还愿意向她伸出援手？"他再次看向真嗣。

我...我们...我们有一个世界要重建。你不认为我们应该先完成更重要的事情吗？"真嗣回避道。"明日香是...我不想失去我现在拥有的。

而你们俩都清楚，这种稳定是岌岌可危的，都在想它能维持多久。你们俩仍然在痛苦中。'似乎有一条不可违背的法则，不冒险者无以取胜，'约翰·保罗·琼斯曾说，他深知孤注一掷的意义。大胜往往需要大冒险，真嗣。我完全有能力同时应对一场战争、重建工作，以及照顾两个我在乎的人。你们俩怎么会不重要呢？重建一个破碎的世界固然是崇高的事业，但最终，只有灵魂才是关键。你们俩已经承受了足够的苦难，理应从神那里得到一些好报。"他嘴角右侧微微上扬，露出一丝半笑。"正如我夫人所说，'诚然如此！'

 真嗣眨了眨眼。"啊？"

丹尼尔挥手打消了他的疑惑。"别介意。我认为她带来的希望可能比你想象的要多。你注意到没有，当神奈在给你看你父亲的'审判'视频时，是她让神奈关掉，让你一个人静一静？无论她当面怎么说，她仍然在乎你，试图保护你不受伤害。"

"她自己就够让我痛苦的了。而且当我问她是否爱我时，她直截了当地说了'不'，" 真嗣疲惫地回答道。

你注意到当青叶先生来接你时，她并不在场，当政变开始时。但你知道为什么吗？

 真嗣摇了摇头。

你已经意识到，当你试图偷偷把那封信放进她的抽屉时，她其实是醒着的，试图在政变出错时给她留一条后路。她读了信，以为她明白了你的意图，就在你睡着后立刻离开了。她不知道你写信是为了以防政变失败。她以为那张纸条意味着你要向温思罗普自首并乞求宽恕。她打算抢先一步，自己去神谷那里，用自己的方式解释你在做什么；把你排除在外，以免你受到伤害。由于她积极要求参与政变，神谷立刻抓住了这个机会。但温思罗普的一个 BABYKA 手下在到达神谷的地方时发现了她的意图。这使得政变提前了一周开始。她试图做的正是你所做的；保护她唯一在乎的人。

真嗣回头望向他，眼中满是沮丧、痛苦与困惑。“那她为什么要说‘不’？她本可以告诉我的！为什么不说呢？”

她……你不知道她内心承受了多少痛苦。她说‘不’是因为她内心深处觉得自己根本不配被爱。所以她不让任何人靠近。但她仍然希望你留在她身边。别放弃。推开你，推开所有人，这是她十六年来唯一知道的方式，为了保护自己的心。她的心比你想象的还要脆弱，真嗣。只是她更擅长隐藏罢了。”丹尼尔抬头望向繁星点点的夜空。“你一直试图保护她免受痛苦。这是她所知最深的痛苦。她坚信自己绝对不值得被爱。她确信如果有人了解‘真正的她’，就会立刻永远地拒绝她。”

他们正沿着海岸线转弯，刚刚离开的海滨别墅又重新映入眼帘。丹尼尔再次低头看向真嗣。“虽然不常表现出来，但我知道你内心有着足够强大的勇气来面对这一切。你曾准备唾弃你父亲，放弃驾驶初号机，但为了保护绫波而选择留下。当你为了保护他人时，你能展现出惊人的勇敢，却对自己不够。我见过你毫不犹豫地跳进活火山去救她。你是否准备好面对更糟的情况，只为拯救她受伤的灵魂？”

真嗣沉默了许久。“我……‘我不能逃避’，是吗？那是我……‘我告诉自己的’。”他向丹尼尔挑了挑眉。“‘受伤的灵魂’？”

丹尼尔微微点头，“如果你能透过我的眼睛看世界，你就会知道这绝非比喻。她受伤了，真嗣，比你严重得多。你的伤口至少大部分已经结痂，而她的伤口还很新鲜，有些甚至尚未愈合。”他的嘴角再次勾起微笑，“只要尽量少说‘对不起’，她就不会对你怎么样。”他们走到了通往海滩小屋门口的小径上，“我们明天再详谈，关于你父亲那导致你经历如此多磨难的‘宏伟计划’，以及他与之对弈的那些人。你所了解的远不及真相的复杂。你之所以饱受折磨，很大程度上是因为你父亲和他的对手们在追求人类补完计划时，真的不在乎谁会受到伤害。”

“我知道，”真嗣悲伤地回答，“真希望一切能有所不同。”

“明天我们看看能为此做些什么。”丹尼尔拉开海滩小屋的门，跟随真嗣走了进去。

A/N：我试图为角色们跟随一个陌生人穿越传送门找到一个合理的理由，心想，‘他们会信任谁呢？哦，或许是他们自己？’特别是明日香，她需要被震撼，从而摆脱自己心理上固守的角落。因此，我利用这一点暗示她，是的，她可以快乐。

### Chapter 03 给上帝一拳

Doubts of the Second Child
第二个孩子的疑虑

+++++++++++
Lieutenant Leibshott led Asuka in to the beach house through the simple iron-strapped wood door and into the open sunken living room. Asuka liked the plush cream-colored carpet, indirect lighting, and central fireplace, but she puzzled over the lack of anything unfamiliar as she looked into the relatively large kitchen. Clouds of spacecraft overhead and multiple Niven rings in the sky, but the kitchen contained nothing that would have looked at all out of place in any kitchen on her Earth. In fact, the only thing she could see that couldn't have been found in her own Berlin apartment was the large black panel in the living room the couches faced which she assumed was some sort of large television.
中尉莱布肖特带领明日香穿过那扇简单的铁箍木门，进入海滩别墅的开阔下沉式客厅。明日香喜欢那柔软的米色地毯、间接照明和中央壁炉，但她对厨房里缺乏任何陌生事物感到困惑。头顶是飞船云集，天空中有多重尼文环，但厨房里的东西在她的地球上任何厨房都不会显得格格不入。事实上，她唯一能看到在她柏林公寓里找不到的东西，就是客厅里沙发面对的那块大黑板，她猜想那可能是一台大型电视。

"Would you like another round, Fr?ulein Sohryu?" Leibshott asked as she opened the liquor cabinet to extract a bottle.
"您还要再来一轮吗，索龙小姐？" 莱布肖特问道，同时她打开酒柜取出一瓶酒。

"Yes, I...wait, you speak German too?" Asuka blinked as she realized she'd been addressed in her native tongue.
"是的，我...等等，你也会说德语吗？" 明日香眨了眨眼，意识到自己被用母语搭话了。

"20th Century Japanese, German, and English were three of the languages I picked for my diploma requirements. I've picked up a few more since then, but those are my best, and come in handy here. Part of why I believe the Emperor asked me to volunteer for this," she replied. She poured three fingers of amber liquid into her own tumbler, then retrieved the bottle of schnapps for Asuka's. "Which I was only too glad to do, especially after I read the brief on your world's recent history and the Angel War. You and Ikari-san have had a Hell of a time." She poured the schnapps into Asuka's tumbler.
"20 世纪的日语、德语和英语是我为满足学位要求选择的三种语言。此后我又学了几种，但那三种是我最擅长的，在这里也派上了用场。这也是我相信皇帝让我自愿参与此事的原因之一，"她回答道。她给自己的杯子倒了三指宽的琥珀色液体，然后又拿过一瓶果酒给明日香倒上。"我非常乐意这么做，尤其是在我读了你们世界近期的历史和天使战争的简报之后。你和碇先生经历了一段艰难的时光。"她将果酒倒入明日香的杯子中。

Asuka regarded her coolly. "Do I get any choice on whether I want a therapist? That's not why I agreed to come along, Frau Doctor." She placed the holstered pistol and belt on the counter next to her drink.
明日香冷冷地看着她。"我有选择是否需要治疗师的权利吗？我同意来这里并不是为了这个，博士夫人。"她把装着手枪的皮套和腰带放在吧台上的饮料旁边。

"Just 'Fr?ulein', I'm still a single lady. But please, call me Ching. His Majesty mentioned my doctorate, but as he said, I'm not here to be your therapist. I'm here to be your guide when you need it and friend if you'll allow it. Not to get into your head, professionally or otherwise, unless you ask. My doctorate is a bonus, not the focus. I'm here because I'm available, speak the relevant languages, and might be someone you can relate to a bit." She indicated her uniform. "We're both female mecha pilots and combat veterans who've had some harsh wounds in battle, for example."
只是'Fr?ulein'，我还是个单身女士。但请叫我 Ching。陛下提到了我的博士学位，但正如他所说，我不是来当你的治疗师的。当你需要时，我是你的向导；如果你允许，我是你的朋友。除非你要求，否则我不会以专业或其他方式进入你的内心。我的博士学位是额外的，不是重点。我在这里是因为我有空，会说相关的语言，而且可能是你能稍微理解的人。"她指了指自己的制服。"我们都是女性机甲驾驶员，都是战斗老兵，都在战斗中受过一些严重的伤。

Asuka grinned grimly. Familiar ground at last. "Hmph, maybe," she said proudly, "But I bet you didn't start as young as I did."
明日香冷笑一声，终于回到了熟悉的领域。"哼，也许吧，"她自豪地说，"但我敢打赌，你开始得没我早。"

Ching acknowledged the point with a tip of her drink. "Hardly. You were what, not yet four when you started training, and fourteen in your first battle? I didn't join the Navy until I was a lot older than that, done with my degree, and had done a little travelling. But I know I've been at it longer. The landing I got mangled up in was my fifteenth assault landing. Got as badly roughed up as you did in that fight with the Mass Production Evas I saw."
青以举杯示意承认了这一点。“当然不是。你开始训练时还不到四岁，第一次战斗时才十四岁吧？我加入海军时年纪比那大得多，已经完成了学位，还旅行了一段时间。但我确实比你从事这行时间长。我受伤的那次登陆是我第十五次突击登陆。就像我看到的你与量产型 EVA 战斗时那样，我也受了重伤。”

"You saw? How?" Asuka was mildly shocked. '"Saw?" 'How could she have seen that fight? Did some of NERV's cameras make it through the Third Impact?'
"你看到了？怎么看到的？" 明日香有些吃惊。"看到？" 她怎么可能看到那场战斗？难道是 NERV 的某些摄像头在第三次冲击中幸存了下来？

Ching paused. "The file His Majesty had me review contained among other things combat footage of all the major engagements of the Angel War. That included your fight against the Mass Production models just before the Third Impact. That was a thing of power and beauty, Fr?ulein Sohryu. Nine on one, and you tore through them like a tornado!" She smiled briefly, but it faded just as quickly. "It was an unfair shame that your power ran out just then. I think you could have completely destroyed them if you hadn't been halted by that."
青停顿了一下。“皇帝陛下让我审阅的文件中，包含了天使战争中所有重大战役的战斗录像，其中就有你在第三次冲击前夕对抗量产型机体的战斗。那是一场力量与美的展现，碇真嗣小姐。九对一，你却如龙卷风般横扫它们！”她微笑片刻，但随即笑容消逝。“遗憾的是，你的力量恰在那时耗尽，实在不公。我想，若非如此，你本可以彻底摧毁它们。”

Asuka took a sip of her schnapps and looked out the wide windows at the waves. Her once favorite topic; her prowess in an Eva unit. And the battle that was both her greatest victory and most terrible defeat. The pain of being beaten and torn apart by the MP Evas mixed with her bitterness at the Third Child's failure to come to her aid and smothered any lingering pride she might have felt at remembering that fight. The joy of finally having her mother truly there with her in the fight was the only good memory to come from it. Still, she would not admit such to someone else. "Yeah, I was the best in the world," she finally bragged.
明日香轻啜了一口她的烈酒，透过宽阔的窗户凝视着波涛。她曾最引以为傲的话题：她在 Eva 机体中的英勇表现，以及那场既是她最辉煌的胜利，也是最惨痛的失败的战斗。被 MP 使徒击败并撕裂的痛苦，与对第三适格者未能前来救援的怨恨交织，扼杀了她回忆那场战斗时可能残留的任何自豪感。唯一值得珍藏的美好记忆，是终于在战斗中真正与母亲同在的喜悦。尽管如此，她绝不会向他人承认这一点。“没错，我是世界上最强的，”她最终自夸道。

"And that was in an Evangelion. If you can turn out that level of a fight in an Evangelion Unit, I'd love to see what you could do in one of our mecha." Asuka gave her an angry look, and she held up a pacifying hand. "I'm not saying anything bad about your Unit-02! I'm just making the observation that it was a product of early 21st Century technology, and had the additional bonus of a unique link between you and your mother's soul. We put you in the pilot's harness of a front line Imperial Battle Mecha like my NAM-91 StarStrider, and you'll be in a far faster, better armed, and much more powerful unit that has the benefit of tens of thousands of years of development behind it. Nine to one? Ha! You're as good as you looked in that fight, you'll be able to go through ninety to one without breaking a sweat!"
那可是在驾驶 EVA 的情况下。如果你能在 EVA 机体中展现出那样的战斗水平，我很想看看你驾驶我们的一台机甲会有怎样的表现。"明日香对她投去愤怒的目光，而她则举起一只手以示安抚。"我并不是在贬低你的二号机！我只是指出，它是 21 世纪初期的技术产物，并且额外拥有你与你母亲灵魂之间的独特联系。如果我们让你坐进像我的 NAM-91 星际行者这样的前线帝国战斗机甲的驾驶舱，你将驾驭一个速度更快、武装更精良、力量更强大的单位，背后有着数万年的发展成果作为支撑。九比一？哈！你在那场战斗中的表现正如你所展现的那样出色，你将能毫不费力地应对九十比一的挑战！"

Asuka considered the idea. The MP Eva waiting for her back on their Earth was a far cry from her old, vanished Unit-02 Production Model. It was still more than a match for anything in the world, as its mere presence had let the coup against Winthrop succeed. It might not be a bad thing to have an even more potent weapon at her disposal. "Hmm, I'd like that. When could we get me into one of your ah...mecha?"
明日香考虑了这个想法。在他们的地球上等待她的 MP 初号机与她那已消失的老款零二生产型相去甚远。尽管如此，它仍然足以匹敌世界上的任何事物，其存在本身就促成了对温斯洛政变的成功。拥有一件更强大的武器或许并非坏事。“嗯，我挺喜欢的。我们什么时候能让我进入你们的那种……机甲？”

"I'll ask His Majesty when they get back, but I don't think in just right away. He definitely wanted to give you two some peace and quiet first. I'll be happy to show you my ride when you can get away from here, though." Ching hesitated, then said in a softer tone, "As an Imperial Subject and sworn Naval officer, I'd hardly be doing the right thing to go around the spirit of something the Emperor promised. So I'm going to be careful not to lie to you, even by omission, Fr?ulein Sohryu; there's more in that file than just combat footage."
我会等陛下他们回来再询问，但我想不会立刻就有答案。他肯定想先给你们俩一些安宁。不过，一旦你能离开这里，我很乐意带你看看我的座驾。" 青犹豫了一下，然后用更柔和的语气说，"作为帝国臣民和宣誓效忠的海军军官，我不能违背皇帝承诺的精神。所以我会小心，不会对你撒谎，哪怕是遗漏，苏尔尤因小姐；那份文件里不仅仅是战斗录像。"

Asuka stared at her. The slightly lighter mood she'd gained speaking to the closest thing to a new peer she'd met in years faded at the slightly ominous words. The protective mask she'd worn so often over the years after the Third Impact slid into place. "Like what?" she asked calmly.
明日香凝视着她。与多年来遇到的第一个近乎新同伴交谈所带来的略微轻松的氛围，在听到那略带不祥的话语后消散了。在第三次冲击之后这些年里她经常戴上的保护面具悄然就位。“比如什么？”她平静地问道。

"Everything we know about you and Ikari-san. Everything we saw between the Second Impact and when the Emperor came to see you. Even some of what went on during Instrumentality, to the extent that it could be recorded. I am not free to say how we acquired all of it yet, but we know a lot about you and him. Probably some things you'd rather were not public. But I promise you, we will not reveal anything to Ikari-san that you don't want us to, or use anything we know to hurt you. But that's how we knew you could use our help. "
关于你和碇真嗣的一切，从第二次冲击到皇帝来见你之间的所见所闻，乃至在人类补完计划期间能被记录下来的部分，我们都了如指掌。我目前还不能透露我们是如何获取这些信息的，但我们对你和他知之甚详，或许有些事情你更希望保密。但我向你保证，未经你同意，我们绝不会向碇真嗣透露任何信息，也不会利用我们所知来伤害你。正是基于此，我们确信你能借助我们的帮助。

Asuka's heartbeat pounded in her ears. 'What did they know?' She had no idea how to respond.
明日香的心跳在耳边砰砰作响。'他们知道什么了？'她完全不知道该如何回应。

Lieutenant Leibshott held up one hand. "Fr?ulein Sohryu, don't be afraid. We will not hurt you. The Emperor promised you 'no lies', and I will not break that. There are more ways to lie than with overt falsehoods. Not telling you we know things you don't want known would be just another way to lie, and therefore be unconscionable to us. We keep our oaths, and we protect our friends. That includes you. I know it is difficult in the extreme for you to trust people you've just met, but please, trust us at least that we will not hurt you by our will. The Emperor has placed you under his aegis. Every person for a thousand kilometers in any direction would die to protect you. And I may not be your doctor, but I'll keep your secrets as tight as any confessor or friend you could ever have would."
莱布施特中尉举起一只手。“苏琉露小姐，不要害怕。我们不会伤害你。皇帝承诺过你‘不说谎’，我也不会违背这一点。谎言不仅仅通过明显的虚假来表达。不告诉你我们知道你不想为人所知的事情，也是一种谎言，对我们来说这是不可原谅的。我们遵守誓言，保护我们的朋友。这其中也包括你。我知道，对你来说，信任刚认识的人极其困难，但请至少相信我们，我们绝不会出于本意伤害你。皇帝已将你置于他的庇护之下。方圆一千公里内的每一个人都愿意为你而死。虽然我不是你的医生，但我会像任何你所能拥有的告解神父或朋友一样，严守你的秘密。”

Asuka took several deep breaths. "Alright." 'I lived through warlords and the end of the world. I can live through this.' "Alright. What kind of things?"
明日香深吸了几口气。“好吧。”‘我经历过军阀混战和世界末日。我能挺过这个。’“好吧。什么样的东西？”

Leibshott looked out at the sea now herself. "We don't know everything. There are large gaps, from the Third Impact to when Ikari-san returned to Berlin. But we know about things like Ikari-san interrupting you in the bath before the coup. We know you personally finished off Winthrop. We know what happened to you when that Angel attacked your mind. We know...there are a lot of things in your past that hurt you, especially when you were very young, with your...family. That's the Emperor's top priority for you; to rescue your mother. He doesn't like to see good people hurt, and you've been hurt a lot. That's why he decided to come to you and Ikari-san. Neither of you deserved the fate you got, so little given back to you after so much was taken. We believe very strongly in justice in the Empire, Fr?ulein Sohryu. Your world did not give you much. We will."
绫波丽现在自己也望向大海。"我们并非无所不知。从第三次冲击到碇先生返回柏林，这段历史存在巨大空白。但我们知道碇先生在你沐浴时打断你的情景，知道是你亲手终结了温斯洛普。我们知道当那个使徒攻击你的心灵时，你经历了什么。我们知道……你的过往中有许多伤痛，尤其是你年幼时与你的……家庭。这是皇帝对你的首要关注；拯救你的母亲。他不愿见到好人受苦，而你已承受太多。这就是他决定来找你和碇先生的原因。你们都不应承受所遭遇的命运，付出如此之多却回报甚少。我们帝国坚信正义，苏芮小姐。你的世界未曾给予你多少。我们将给予你。"

Asuka put her tumbler down gently. Her pulse had slowed a little from the pounding beat it had surged to when panicked visions of all the darkness of her past being exposed flooded her mind, but her throat was still uncomfortably tight, and only her familiar old mask kept her face calm and her breathing mostly steady. 'He promised no lies. Mama back with us, 'she' said.' She fought herself under control. "Nothing I don't want him to know to Shin-...the Third Child, yes?"
明日香轻轻放下她的杯子。她的心跳已从恐慌中涌起的剧烈跳动稍稍放缓，那时她脑海中充斥着过去所有黑暗被揭露的可怕景象，但她的喉咙依旧紧绷得难受，只有那张熟悉的旧面具让她面容保持平静，呼吸也大体稳定。“他承诺过不说谎。妈妈回来了，‘她’说。”她努力控制住自己。“没有什么是我不想让他知道，对真嗣……第三适格者，是的？”

"I can't speak for what His Majesty might tell him, but I promise I won't tell him anything you haven't told me I can. That was explicit in my instructions, Fr?ulein Sohryu. I'm here to be a friend for you. Even to taking your side in silence."
我无法代表陛下可能会告诉他什么，但我保证，我不会告诉他任何你未曾允许我透露的信息。我的指示中明确提到这一点，苏流英小姐。我来这里是为了成为你的朋友，甚至会在沉默中站在你这一边。

"What happened to not lying even by omission?" Asuka cynically retorted.
"不是说连遗漏都不算撒谎吗？" 明日香讽刺地反驳道。

"When I've been specifically and directly ordered by my Lord and sovereign to do just that? His Majesty said you needed a confidant and friend even more than Ikari-san. And I agreed." She knocked back the last of her drink. "I'm impressed at how much you've survived and still come out as whole as you are. I don't know if I could have done the same."
当我的主宰和国王明确直接地命令我这么做时？陛下说你比碇先生更需要一个知己和朋友。我对此表示赞同。" 她一饮而尽杯中酒。"我很惊讶你经历了这么多还能保持如此完整。我不知道我是否能做到同样的事。"

Asuka's control still couldn't completely suppress the cold feeling that rippled across her skin. "Whole?" She picked up her drink and let the sharp bite of the schnapps try to warm the cold pit of her stomach. "I'm very tired. I've had to...accept a lot of pieces of myself getting whittled away to stay this 'whole'. Or did you miss what was going on in the episode in the bathtub you say you know about?"
明日香的控制力仍无法完全压制住皮肤上泛起的寒意。“完整吗？”她拿起饮料，让烈性白兰地的辛辣尝试温暖她胃中的冰冷。“我很疲惫。我不得不……接受自己的许多部分被削减，以保持这种‘完整’。还是说，你错过了你在谈论的那一集中浴缸里的情节？”

Ching looked at her a little sadly. "No. I confess that for all I know intellectually what was going on there, it's still hard for me to understand what you were going though on a gut level. We're...not very familiar with despair here in the Empire. Rather the opposite, we always, always know the Lord is watching over us, and that none of us will ever be lost, or forgotten. That's why it's not precisely required, but a very strong tradition here to travel outside the Empire or even the Associated Realms to see what life's like for non-Imperials. The experience for many, as it was for me, is eye-opening. We aren't ignorant of pain in the Empire, but we always know at the bottom that the world the Lord gives us is fair. Virtue is rewarded, evil is punished, justice is done. To see worlds upon worlds where this is not so...awakens in us the same fieron that fills the Emperor too; to see justice done. To make things right."
青看着她，略带忧伤地说：“不，我承认尽管我理智上知道那里发生了什么，但我仍然难以从内心深处理解你所经历的一切。在我们帝国，我们并不太熟悉绝望。恰恰相反，我们始终坚信主在注视着我们，我们中没有人会迷失或被遗忘。这就是为什么虽然不是严格要求，但在我们这里却有着强烈的传统，鼓励人们走出帝国甚至联合领域，去了解非帝国人民的生活。对许多人来说，就像我一样，这种经历是令人大开眼界的。在帝国，我们并非对痛苦一无所知，但我们始终坚信，主赐予我们的世界是公平的。美德得到奖赏，邪恶受到惩罚，正义得以伸张。看到一个又一个这样的世界……唤醒了我们与皇帝心中同样的激情；看到正义得以实现，让一切变得正确。”

Asuka regarded her with a mix of cynicism and wistfulness. Nobody talked like that on post-Third Impact Earth. Not without it being a blatantly dishonest cloak for the usual brutality and manipulation of the warlord-du-jour. It had been a long, long time since Asuka had even heard something as idealistic. Well, that hadn't come out of the Third Child's mouth, right after he'd done or said something suicidally stupid like give money to people who'd been beaten as subversives by the secret police. Ching sounded like that. She also sounded like she honestly meant it. Asuka stumbled a bit over that last part in her head. "'Fieron?'"
明日香带着一丝讥讽和怀旧看着她。在第三次冲击后的地球上，没有人会这样说话。除非这是为了掩盖当下军阀惯用的残暴和操纵手段而故意为之的虚伪外衣。明日香已经很久很久没有听到过如此理想主义的言论了。当然，这并非出自第三适格者之口，在他做出或说出那些自杀般愚蠢的事情之后，比如把钱给那些被秘密警察当作异端殴打的人。青的声音就像那样。而且听起来她是真心实意的。明日香在脑海中对最后一点感到有些困惑。"'费隆？'"

Ching blinked at her for a second, then tapped herself on the forehead. "Ah, sorry. Some words in Avaloni don't have good analogues in German. 'Fieron' translates as...mmm, 'the fires that drive' I suppose. The burn you feel deep inside that pushes you onward. What makes you go on when all reason says you can't. For a lot of Imperials, it's to go out and do good, to bring justice to places where it is not found. That's why I joined the Navy. Because after seeing the worlds out there where people suffer without hope, places like yours, to stay home and not do something to help was a moral choice I couldn't make. My fieron won't let me."
青眨了眨眼，然后拍了拍自己的额头。“啊，抱歉。阿瓦隆语中有些词汇在德语里找不到很好的对应词。‘Fieron’翻译过来大概是……嗯，‘驱动之火’吧。那种深藏在内心的燃烧感，推动你前行的力量。当所有理智告诉你无法继续时，是什么让你坚持下去。对许多帝国人来说，是为了出去做好事，将正义带到那些缺失它的地方。这也是我加入海军的原因。因为在目睹了那些人们绝望受苦的世界，像你的家乡那样的世界后，选择留在家中无所作为，对我来说是无法做出的道德抉择。我的驱动之火不允许我这样做。”

"Places like mine...yeah, not a lot of hope there," Asuka agreed. "I guess mine would have been to be an Eva Pilot. Most of my life was devoted to that. Gott, I was stupid." Asuka looked at the bottle of schnapps, and thought 'Why the fuck not? How long has it been since I've had a chance to drink anything decent just because I wanted to? And today's had more than enough reasons for me to want one!' She filled her tumbler again. 'Pregnant? "Did he ask you? Or did you ask him?"' Gott! That couldn't have been real. No. No way. He'd never-' She felt like she was down the rabbit hole, alright. She took a sip of schnapps.
"像我这样的地方...是啊，没什么希望可言。" 明日香同意道，"我猜我曾经的梦想是成为 Eva 驾驶员。我大半辈子都献给了这个目标。上帝，我真傻。" 明日香看着那瓶烈酒，心想：'为什么不呢？我有多久没机会因为自己想喝而喝点好酒了？今天有太多理由让我想喝上一杯！' 她再次斟满了自己的酒杯。'怀孕了？"是他问你的吗？还是你问他的？"'天啊！那不可能是真的。不可能，绝对不可能。他永远不会——' 她感觉自己仿佛掉进了兔子洞，没错。她抿了一口烈酒。

Ching watched her brood for a moment. "There are worse things to be than a mecha pilot, Fr?ulein Sohryu, such as being one of the Poor Bloody Infantry, or a corpse. I thought being an Eva Pilot was what kept you alive after the warlords got a hold of you?" she said.
青凝视着她的孩子们片刻，说道：“成为一名机甲驾驶员总比成为步兵炮灰或尸体要好，索伦小姐。我以为成为 EVA 驾驶员是在军阀控制你之后让你活下来的原因？”

Asuka snorted. "Yeah, and it got me into an Entry Plug again, but it also put me through plenty of shit in the meantime. Things I'd rather not remember. You may not know despair, but it's far too familiar to me. And even being an Eva Pilot still didn't make me..." 'worth anything. I can't even make it move now without Shi—the Third Child there to help. Help. Me, needing that idiot to make an Eva move. And what happens when he gets tired and leaves like everyone else? What can I-' She stopped herself. She had run that line of thinking around in her head too many times in the last month anyhow. "Anyway, aren't you supposed to be showing me around here?"
明日香哼了一声。“是啊，又让我坐进了插入栓，但这期间也让我经历了太多不堪回首的事。那些我宁愿忘记的事情。你可能不知道绝望，但它对我来说太熟悉了。即使成为 EVA 驾驶员，我仍然没有……”‘有什么价值。现在没有第三适格者的帮助，我甚至无法让 EVA 动起来。需要那个笨蛋来帮我操作 EVA。如果他累了，像其他人一样离开，我该怎么办？我能做什么——’她打断了自己的思绪。无论如何，上个月她已经在脑海中反复思考过这个问题太多次了。“话说回来，你不是应该带我参观这里吗？”

Ching eyed her in a way that Asuka knew meant her none too subtle change of subject hadn't gone unnoticed. She nodded her head anyway. "Jawohl, Fr?ulein Sohryu." She looked up and appeared to talk to the ceiling. "Bee Aitch! Call to Lord Privy Secretary Verfico, please." There was a quiet chime, and the large screen in the living room area came to life. A white heraldic shield with two red upward-pointed chevrons and three red square crosses, wreathed by oak leaves and fronted by a hollow four-pointed star with an infinity symbol at the center occupied the screen, with 'CALLING' flashing underneath it.
青木以一种让明日香明白她那并不太巧妙的转移话题并未被忽视的方式盯着她。她还是点了点头。"遵命，索龙小姐。"她抬头似乎对着天花板说话。"Bee Aitch！请呼叫内阁大臣维菲科。"一声轻响后，客厅区域的大屏幕亮了起来。屏幕上是一个白色的纹章盾牌，上面有两道红色向上指的楔形和三个红色方形十字，周围环绕着橡树叶，前面是一个空心的四角星，中心是无限符号，下方闪烁着"正在呼叫"的字样。

"The house has a low-grade AI, voice controlled. Just preface anything you mean for it with 'bee aitch'. Beach House, see? It controls the com screen, lights, fireplace, whatever you need. It's smart enough to ask for help from better systems if it can't parse what you said." The screen cleared to reveal a hawk-faced older man, the dark hair graying at his temples a match for his weathered face.
这栋房子配备了一个低级人工智能，声控操作。只需在你想让它执行的指令前加上“bee aitch”。明白了吗，Beach House？它能控制通讯屏幕、灯光、壁炉，以及你需要的任何东西。如果它无法解析你的指令，它足够智能，会向更高级的系统求助。屏幕上出现了一位面容如鹰的老人，他鬓角斑白的黑发与他饱经风霜的面庞相得益彰。

"Good evening, Lieutenant Leibshott, Fr?ulein Sohryu. How may I assist you?" His German was perfect, but his gruff voice had a slight, strange American accent of all things.
晚上好，莱布什特中尉，索龙小姐。有什么可以帮到您的吗？他的德语非常标准，但那粗犷的嗓音中却带着一丝奇怪的美国口音。

"Good evening, m'lord. I just wanted to introduce you to Fr?ulein Sohryu and show her the house's com screen functions." She turned to Asuka. "Lord Verfico is the Emperor's Privy Secretary. He always knows where to find him. If you're ever looking for him, just call Lord Verfico and he can get you in touch. Or for anything you need, if I'm not around or something comes to mind you need fast. He can make anything you need happen."
晚上好，大人。我想向您介绍索龙小姐，并展示她如何使用家中通讯屏幕的功能。"她转向明日香，"维菲科大人乃皇帝的私人秘书，他总能知道皇帝的行踪。若您需要找皇帝，只需联系维菲科大人，他便能帮您联络。或者，无论您有何需求，若我不在或您急需某事，他都能帮您实现。"

He nodded greetings to Asuka. "I'm hardly a wizard, Lieutenant. But I'm sure I can adequately field any questions or requests Fr?ulein Sohryu may have. Might I inquire as to the whereabouts of Herr Ikari?"
他向明日香点头致意，说道：“我当然不是什么巫师，中尉。但我确信我能妥善回答或处理绫波丽小姐可能提出的任何问题或请求。请问，碇先生现在在哪里？”

"He's walking around for a bit with His Majesty, m'lord. They should be back in a few more minutes."
他正与陛下四处走走，大人。他们应该再过几分钟就回来了。

"Very good. Do please remind our liege there's a Privy Council meeting he called at twenty-seven hundred, and that Her Majesty is due in tomorrow morning."
非常好。请务必提醒我们的君主，他召集的枢密院会议定于二十七点举行，并且女王陛下将于明早到达。

"I shall, m'lord. I doubt he'll have forgotten the latter, though! Goodnight, m'lord."
我会的，大人。不过我怀疑他还没忘记后者呢！晚安，大人。

"Goodnight, Lieutenant, Fr?ulein Sohryu." And the screen went black once more.
"晚安，少尉，苏流玉小姐。" 屏幕再次变黑。

"The com screen will do video, computer work, Net access, calls, that sort of things. You can do audio calls from anywhere in the house or close around it. The kitchen's fully stocked with most things you might need, and BH can get anything you ask for delivered in a hurry. Come on, I'll show you the rest of the house." She headed down the hallway off the back of the living room area with Asuka in tow.
"这个屏幕可以进行视频、电脑工作、上网、通话等操作。你可以在房子内任何地方或其附近进行音频通话。厨房备有你可能需要的绝大多数物品，而且 BH 可以迅速为你订购所需物品。来吧，我带你看看房子的其他部分。"她带着明日香沿着客厅后面的走廊走去。

"What did he mean by 'twenty-seven hundred'?" Asuka asked.
“他说的'二十七百'是什么意思？”明日香问道。

"The time, of course. Oh, right, Earth has a shorter day. Avalon has a thirty hour day. Twenty-seven hundred is in about an hour from now. The Emperor will have to go to that Privy Council meeting, but he'll be back by dawn." She waved Asuka into the door on her left. Asuka's eyes widened a bit at the size of the room and bed. The bed on the left side of the room was easily larger than any she'd slept in or seen in her life.
当然是时间问题。哦，对了，地球的一天较短。阿瓦隆的一天有三十个小时。现在是二十七百小时左右，大约一小时后。皇帝得去参加那个御前会议，但他会在黎明前回来。"她挥手示意明日香进入她左边的门。明日香看到房间和床的大小，眼睛微微睁大。房间左侧的床比她一生中睡过或见过的任何床都要大得多。

The single bed. 单人床。

Asuka locked her eyes on it for a long moment. She partly heard Ching talking about the bathroom's large whirlpool tub and features. She snapped her eyes away from it when she noticed that Ching had fallen silent and was staring at her with a faintly sad expression.
明日香久久地凝视着它。她隐约听到青在谈论浴室里的大型漩涡浴缸及其特点。当她察觉到青已经沉默下来，并用略带忧伤的表情注视着她时，她才将目光移开。

"What?" Asuka managed to keep her voice neutral.
"什么？" 明日香尽力保持声音中立。

Ching stepped closer and placed a hand lightly on her shoulder. "...We can get another bed or room for you, if you want," Ching said just as neutrally.
青走近一步，轻轻地将手放在她的肩上。“……如果你愿意，我们可以为你再准备一张床或一个房间，”青同样平静地说道。

Asuka met her eyes for another long moment. "No. This is fine. The Third Child and I...have an arrangement," she said eventually, her voice devoid of emotion.
明日香与她对视了片刻，最终说道：“不，这样就好。第三适格者和我……有约定。”她的声音毫无情感。

Ching raised her right eyebrow just a hair, but declined to argue the statement. "As you wish, Fr?ulein Sohryu."
青只是微微扬起了右眉，但没有反驳这句话。“如您所愿，索龙小姐。”

"Just...call me Asuka." 就...叫我明日香吧。

A genuine smile crossed her face. "As you wish, Asuka." She walked past her out the door of the room. "This way. Let me show you the workout room. Its set up as a dojo right now, but BH can swap out weights or other workout gear..."
她脸上露出了真挚的笑容。"如你所愿，明日香。"她从她身边走过，出了房间门。"这边请。我带你去看看健身房。现在布置成了一个道场，但 BH 可以更换成重量器械或其他健身设备……"

Asuka trailed behind her, half listening. The spartan workout room, couple more bedrooms, and a small library rounded out the rest of the house. Returning to the kitchen counter where they'd left their drinks, Asuka ventured a question.
明日香跟在后面，半听半不听的。简朴的健身房、几间卧室和一个小图书馆构成了房子的其余部分。回到厨房台面，他们之前放饮料的地方，明日香鼓起勇气问了一个问题。

"My double said... that he... that Daniel was a god. She seemed to mean that literally. Was she telling the truth?"
我的分身说……他……说丹尼尔是神。她似乎是字面上这么认为的。她是在说实话吗？

Ching gave her an amused look. "You think you are the kind of person who'd tell yourself that big a whopper if it wasn't?"
青给了她一个好笑的表情。“你以为你是那种人，如果不是的话，会对自己撒这么大的谎吗？”

"She said plenty of other things that make me wonder if she was messing with me. If I was messing with me. I. Whatever."
她说了很多其他的话，让我怀疑她是不是在捉弄我。如果我在捉弄我自己。我。随便吧。

Ching snorted into her drink, then took a sip. "20th Century German can't handle discussing time loops very well. Avaloni has tenses for that, if you get a chance to learn it. But yes, you were telling yourself the literal truth. His Majesty is not just my secular ruler. He's also the creator of my Avaloni ancestors, everything you see around you, this whole cosmos, all of it. He's cosmic and spiritual creator of, intercessor for, and final judge of my soul and everyone in the Empire. He is the Alpha and the Omega of this universe. He's da Boss." She grinned at Asuka's increasingly funny look. "Ok, I threw in that last one as a gag. But yes, he's just what 'you' told yourself. When you hear me refer to the Lord, that's him in his more divine aspect. He's the Emperor when we're talking in more secular terms. And he's decided that your world screwed you over, and wants to help you get some back."
青轻蔑地哼了一声，随即抿了一口饮料。“20 世纪的德语并不擅长讨论时间循环。如果你有机会学习，阿瓦隆尼语有专门为此设立的时态。但没错，你刚才对自己说的确实是字面上的真相。陛下不仅仅是我的世俗统治者，他还是我的阿瓦隆尼祖先的创造者，你所见周围的一切，整个宇宙，都是他创造的。他是我的灵魂以及帝国中每个人的宇宙和精神创造者、调解者和最终审判者。他是这个宇宙的阿尔法和欧米伽，他就是老大。”她对着明日香越来越滑稽的表情咧嘴一笑，“好吧，最后那句是我加进去的玩笑。但确实，他就是你告诉自己的那个人。当你听到我提到主时，那是他在更神圣的一面。当我们用更世俗的术语交谈时，他就是皇帝。他认定你的世界亏待了你，想要帮你讨回一些公道。”

"And you have sat down and had a drink with him. I...I'm having a hard time accepting that a god randomly walks into my tent one night and offers to give me everything I could possibly want. That doesn't happen, or the story usually has a catch somewhere." Asuka shook her head.
你还坐下来和他喝了杯酒。我……我实在难以接受，一个神明某天晚上突然走进我的帐篷，提出要给我所有我可能想要的东西。这种事不会发生，或者故事里通常会有什么陷阱。" 明日香摇了摇头。

"No catch here. He just hates seeing bad things happen to good people. And everything happens somewhere. This time your luck came up with a real jackpot." Ching played with her empty glass on the counter. "Your story isn't unknown, Asuka. Or rather, the Angel War isn't. The fuzziness of all the different worlds of what came after is the subject of a modest number of stories in the library of all things that could happen. Yours is one of the darker ones, but not the worst, from what the Emperor has told me. And he felt you and Ikari-san shouldn't have had to go through all the pain of the Angel War and then everything that came after it without someone balancing the scales at the end. So he decided he'd provide that weight on your side."
这里没有陷阱。他只是讨厌看到坏事发生在好人身上。而且，万事皆有发生之地。这次你的运气碰上了真正的头奖。"青在柜台上摆弄着她的空杯子。"你的故事并非无人知晓，飞鸟。或者更确切地说，天使战争不是。所有可能发生的世界之后的那种模糊性，是图书馆中为数不多的故事主题之一。你的故事算是比较黑暗的，但并非最糟，据皇帝告诉我。他认为你和碇先生不应该在经历了天使战争及其后的一切痛苦后，没有人来平衡结局的天平。因此，他决定为你们这边提供那份重量。"

"Mine's 'one of the darker ones'? Darker what?" Asuka asked.
"我的'是其中较暗的一个'？暗指的是什么？" 明日香问道。

"Infinite universes, almost anything happens. 'Doctor Faustus' happened somewhere, 'The Illiad' happened somewhere, and 'Evangelion' happened somewhere. Your world was a darker story of what might have come next."
无限宇宙中，几乎任何事情都可能发生。《浮士德博士》在某处上演，《伊利亚特》在某处发生，《新世纪福音战士》也在某处存在。而你的世界，则是那个可能后续更为阴暗的故事。

"I'm...a story?" Asuka said skeptically.
“我……是个故事？”明日香怀疑地说。

Ching shrugged. "In infinite universes, everyone's story is written down somewhere. Ours may be somewhere too. You're not fictional, Asuka. No more than anyone else is. Don't worry about it too much."
青耸了耸肩。“在无限宇宙中，每个人的故事都在某个地方被记载着。我们的故事也许也在某个角落。你不是虚构的，明日香。并不比其他人更虚构。别太担心这个了。”

"But I know Thomas Mann wrote 'Doctor Faustus'. If that isn't fictional, how do I know I'm..." She trailed off in bafflement.
但我知道托马斯·曼写了《浮士德博士》。如果那不是虚构的，我怎么知道我……"她困惑地停了下来。

"Questions like that keep the Philosophy and Theology Research Departments over at Avalon Imperial University going all night. That's why I went into Psychiatry. For all the twists and caverns, the human mind is a damn sight simpler."
类似的问题让阿瓦隆帝国大学的哲学与神学研究部门整夜忙碌。这也是我选择精神病学的原因，尽管人类思维有诸多曲折和深邃之处，但它比起那些问题要简单得多。

"You're making me glad I got my degree in Mathematics. All that Philosophy is the Third's idea of fun." She sighed, and rubbed her forehead. "And so now I've got a god on my side."
你让我庆幸自己拿到了数学学位。所有那些哲学，不过是第三者的娱乐方式。她叹了口气，揉了揉额头。"而现在，我有了一个神站在我这边。"

"There are benefits to having Avalon on your side, Asuka. When you are a friend of the Emperor, your enemies are his too. And the amount of furious, holy wrath the Emperor alone can unleash on your enemies is awesome to behold. Sinners in the hands of a very angry god, indeed. Justice will be done, amen." Ching said with a smile.
拥有阿瓦隆站在你这边，飞鸟，好处多多。当你成为皇帝的朋友，你的敌人也就成了他的敌人。而皇帝一人所能释放的狂怒神圣之怒，对敌人来说，实在是令人敬畏。罪人在一个非常愤怒的神手中，确实如此。正义必将得到伸张，阿门。" 青笑着说道。

Her smile got sharper. "And then his wife gets a turn," she said. "The Lord may show mercy sometimes. The Lady is less...forgiving. Particularly of those who hurt children."
她的笑容变得更加锐利。“然后就轮到他妻子了，”她说，“主有时会施以怜悯。而女神则不那么……宽容。尤其是对那些伤害孩子的人。”

The door opened behind Asuka, and she turned to see Daniel and the Third walk in.
门在明日香身后打开，她转头看见丹尼尔和第三个人走了进来。

Part 5 第 5 部分
Punching God In The Face
打上帝的脸

A brief discussion with Lieutenant Leibshott asking her to show Shinji the place as well, and Daniel asked Asuka out into the night with him. She hadn't done more than exchange a look with the silent Third Child. He seemed downbeat, and deep in thought. Hardly different than his usual demeanor, but he'd stared at her with odd intensity. She dropped the thought, letting the warm sea breeze clear a bit of the light buzz the schnapps were beginning to set up in her head.
与莱布施特中尉简短交谈，请她带真嗣也去那个地方看看，而丹尼尔则邀请明日香与他一同夜游。她与沉默寡言的第三适格者之间仅限于眼神交流。他显得情绪低落，沉思着。与平时的举止并无太大差异，但他以一种奇特的强烈目光注视着她。她抛开这个念头，任由温暖的海风驱散了些许烈酒在脑海中引起的轻微醉意。

They walked slowly in silence until Asuka broke it with a flat statement in German. "So, you're a god."
他们默默地缓步前行，直到明日香用德语平淡地打破了沉默：“那么，你是神。”

He nodded. "For most values of the word. The details are more complicated."
他点头道：“对于这个词的大多数含义来说是这样。但细节更为复杂。”

"And you...can bring back Ma-...my mother?"
而你……能带回妈妈……我母亲吗？

He nodded again. "I can." He was silent for another moment. "Fr?ulein Sohryu, her madness from the partial absorption of her soul into Unit-02 and her death hurt you deeply, and affected the rest of your life. It was the first of too many harsh injuries to your soul. I am a healer, when possible. I can ease your pain by bringing your mother back to you, so I will. I care about you two. I don't want to see you hurting." Asuka was unsurprised by now that his German was as clear as hers.
他再次点了点头。“我可以。”他沉默了片刻。“惣流小姐，她因部分灵魂被吸入二号机而陷入疯狂，以及她的去世，给你带来了深重的伤害，影响了你的余生。这是你灵魂遭受的众多严酷伤害中的第一道。我是一名治疗者，在可能的情况下。我能通过让你母亲回到你身边来减轻你的痛苦，所以我会的。我关心你们俩。我不想看到你们受苦。”到这时，明日香已经不惊讶他的德语和她的一样清晰了。

After a few hundred meters, he grimaced slightly. "It's hard to walk next to you, Fr?ulein Sohryu. You're radiating pain like a city on fire."
走了几百米后，他微微皱了皱眉。“和您并肩行走真不容易，明日香小姐。您散发出的痛苦如同燃烧的城市一般。”

At her suspicious look he protested. "I'm not reading your mind; I promised. But I can feel it pouring off you, see it in every line of your face, the way you hold yourself...It's like the heat coming off a flame. I hate seeing people I care for in pain."
面对她怀疑的眼神，他辩解道：“我没有读你的心，我承诺过的。但我能感受到你的情绪如潮水般涌来，从你脸上的每一道线条，你保持自己的方式中都能看出来……就像火焰散发的热量一样。我讨厌看到我在乎的人受苦。”

"So what are you waiting for? If you can bring back my mother, do it!" Asuka bit out.
“那你还在等什么？如果你能把我母亲带回来，那就去做吧！”明日香急切地说道。

"We'll go back to your world and do that tomorrow morning. But there's more in your life that's causing you pain than just that loss. What else do you want?"
我们明天早上会回到你的世界去处理那件事。但你的生活中还有其他事情正在给你带来痛苦，不仅仅是那个损失。你还想要什么？

Asuka exploded. "I want you to explain what the Hell all that was! That, that...her! Why was 'I' pregnant? Why was she wearing a ring? Why...why..."
明日香爆发了。“我要你解释清楚那到底是怎么回事！那个，那个...她！为什么‘我’怀孕了？为什么她戴着戒指？为什么...为什么...”

"Why was she happy?" Daniel said gently.
“她为什么高兴？”丹尼尔温和地说。

"Yes! What happened to her? To me! I..." Asuka burst out in frustration.
“是的！她怎么了？我呢！我……”明日香沮丧地爆发了。

"I honestly don't know, Fr?ulein Sohryu. They are from six months in my future too. They said they came back by prior arrangement to when I was about to start this. But I can make some educated guesses. What did she tell you?"
老实说，我也不清楚，明日香小姐。这些信息也是来自我六个月后的未来。他们说他们是按照事先的安排，在我即将开始这一切之前回来的。但我可以做一些有根据的猜测。她告诉了你什么？

"Nothing! She just fucking winked at me when I saw the ring! And said she...she told him..."
什么都没有！当我看到戒指时，她居然朝我眨了眨眼！还说她……她告诉他……

"Shinji? Told him what?"
真嗣？告诉他什么了？

"Yes! She told him...Grraagghh!" Asuka broke into garbled sounds of anger. "I can't believe she...I...gah! That I'd...Was I screwing with myself? Why would I do that?"
是的！她告诉他了...啊啊啊！" 明日香突然爆发出愤怒的含糊声音。"我真不敢相信她...我...啊！难道我一直在自欺欺人吗？我为什么要这么做？

"You/she seemed very happy. I think you were messing with yourself to some extent at least because you thought it would be amusing."
你/她似乎非常开心。我想你至少在某种程度上是在自娱自乐，因为你觉得这样会很有趣。

"It's not funny!" Asuka growled.
"这一点都不好笑！" 明日香咆哮道。

"I imagine it must be and will be to you when you go back to talk to the you of six months ago." Daniel said calmly. "Given the amount of frustration you're boiling over with now. Maybe she just wanted to shake you into thinking about things you'd rather not?"
我想当你回去和六个月前的你交谈时，它对你来说一定是而且将是如此。”丹尼尔平静地说。“考虑到你现在所承受的巨大挫败感。也许她只是想让你思考那些你宁愿不去想的事情？

"Do you think that was funny?"
你觉得那很好笑吗？

"No, Fr?ulein Sohryu," he said very quietly. "I'd never mock your pain. Not when I can feel it almost as acutely as you can."
不，惣流小姐，" 他轻声说道，"我绝不会嘲笑你的痛苦。当我几乎能像你一样深切地感受到它时，我怎么会呢。

The frustrated energy that had propelled Asuka suddenly ran out of her. "Then you can start by not calling me 'Fr?ulein Sohryu'. Just use my name. 'Fr?ulein' doesn't feel right, and I won't be Pilot Sohryu for much longer."
推动明日香前进的挫败感突然从她身上消失了。"那你先从不要叫我'惣流小姐'开始吧。直接叫我的名字。'小姐'感觉不对，而且我也不会再当多久的惣流驾驶员了。"

"The Dummy Plug system? Does it bother you that it will take away the leverage that comes from being the only Eva Pilots in the world and guarantees your safety, or is it the loss of the identity as a Pilot that has defined you for so long?"
"Dummy Plug 系统？它是否会困扰你，因为它将剥夺你作为世界上唯一 Eva 驾驶员所享有的安全保障和优势，还是说，失去长期以来定义你的驾驶员身份才是你担忧的？"

"Both." Asuka said after a bit. "What else is there left of me...for me after that?"
"两者都是。" 过了一会儿，明日香说道，"在那之后，我还有什么剩下的...留给我自己的？"

"Ok, so we wipe out the Dummy Plug system. Next?"
好的，那么我们废除 Dummy Plug 系统。接下来呢？

"What?" "什么？"

"We stop that system from ever coming on line. No one will take your position as Eva Pilot from you. What's next that I can do for you?"
我们阻止那个系统上线，没有人会取代你作为 Eva 驾驶员的位置。接下来我还能为你做些什么？

The wave of relief at the potential elimination of the threat to her lifelong position was far weaker than Asuka would have expected. "I don't know. I don't know anything anymore." She stopped and sank down on her knees in the sand. "I'm just tired."
对于可能消除威胁她终身地位的这一波宽慰，其强度远低于明日香所预料的。“我不知道。我现在什么都不知道了。”她停下脚步，跪倒在沙滩上。“我只是累了。”

Daniel likewise sat down next to her, facing her. "The nights on Avalon are long. You'll get plenty of rest."
丹尼尔同样在她旁边坐下，面对着她。"阿瓦隆的夜晚很长，你会得到充分的休息。"

"That's not what I meant."
那不是我的本意。

"I know." He leaned back on his hands and looked up at the sky. "What do you think of my handiwork?"
"我知道。" 他双手撑地，仰望天空，"你觉得我的手艺怎么样？"

Asuka's gaze slowly rose from the sand immediately in front of her knees to the blazing night sky. Some of the moons had set, but the enormous arcs of night and day rectangles still gave more light than the brightest full moon Asuka had ever seen.
明日香的目光缓缓从她膝盖前的沙地移向炽热的夜空。一些月亮已经落下，但昼夜巨大的矩形弧线依然散发着比明日香所见过的最亮的满月还要强烈的光芒。

"It...all seems unreal." She stared at the lights in the sky. "This morning I was watching a patched-together armada getting ready for another war that I'd be 'starring' in. And that war was the best thing I could look forward to in the rest of my life. In a matter of months the Dummy Plug system would make me obsolete and I'd have nothing. The Third Child would get tired of me and leave, just like everyone else I've ever known. Now I've got a man who 'I' told myself is a god offering anything I want sitting next to me..."
“这一切……似乎都不真实。”她凝视着天空中闪烁的灯光。“今早我还在看着那支拼凑起来的舰队准备迎接另一场战争，而我将在这场战争中‘主演’。那场战争曾是我余生中唯一能期待的美好。几个月后，Dummy Plug 系统将使我变得过时，我将一无所有。第三适格者也会对我厌倦，离我而去，就像我认识的所有人一样。现在，一个自称是神的男人坐在我身边，承诺给我想要的一切……”

"And you don't know what you want?" Daniel asked.
"你不知道自己想要什么吗？" 丹尼尔问道。

"And I don't know what to think of anything. That...if that was me from six months in the future...why would I just...why couldn't I just say what was going on? And Lieutenant Leibshott tells me my 'story isn't unknown', that my whole world and all I've known is a story to you like 'Doctor Faustus' is to me. That you and who knows who else already knows all the darkest secrets of my life. That you know I was desperate enough before the coup to try killing myself and the Third had to stop me..." She closed her eyes. "And yet somehow, in six months, I'm pregnant, wearing a ring...his ring? And I'm...happy..."
我不知道该如何思考任何事情。如果那是六个月后的我……为什么我不能直接说出发生了什么？莱布施托中尉告诉我，我的“故事并非未知”，我的整个世界和我所知道的一切对你来说就像《浮士德博士》对我一样。你和不知名的其他人已经知道了我生活中最黑暗的秘密。你知道在政变之前，我绝望到试图自杀，而第三者不得不阻止我……”她闭上了眼睛。“然而不知怎么的，六个月后，我怀孕了，戴着戒指……他的戒指？而我……很幸福……”

"I think I'm beginning to understand why your older self hit you with all that. You're not happy now, and you find the idea that you could be impossible to grapple with. If she hadn't shown you all that, would you have believed it if I just told you?"
我想我开始明白为什么你的年长自己会对你说那些话了。你现在并不快乐，而且你发现要接受自己可能变得快乐的想法难以把握。如果她没有向你展示那些，如果我只是告诉你，你会相信吗？

Asuka considered it. "Probably not. I'd have said you were crazy. Or trying to make me angry."
明日香考虑了一下。“可能不会。我会觉得你疯了，或者想惹我生气。”

"Well, I'm not trying to make you angry, and I want to make you happy. I care about you two. Almost as much as he cares about you."
“嗯，我不是想惹你生气，我是想让你开心。我很在乎你们俩，几乎和他一样在乎你。”

Asuka's look would have been a glare if there had been any heat to it. "Don't."
如果眼神能带有温度，那明日香的眼神一定是怒视。“别这样。”

"Asuka, how long has it been since you've had a friend? Or even just someone to talk to?"
明日香，你有多久没有朋友了？或者仅仅是有人可以交谈？

Asuka's eyes pinched shut. "I don't need friends. I don't need anybody. Everyone leaves." Faces flashed in her mind's eye. Father, practically abandoning her after Mother went away. Kaji, vanished and according to Shinji probably dead in his idiotic quest for 'the truth'. Hikari, evacuated while Asuka was catatonic from mind-rape, never heard from again. Hans, Winthrop's subordinate she'd tried to latch on to as a protector, who just left her cold when Winthrop promoted him to send him away. Shinji, staying in Boston for years after she'd approached Winthrop...
明日香的眼睛紧紧闭上。“我不需要朋友。我不需要任何人。每个人都会离开。”她脑海中闪过一张张面孔。父亲，在母亲离开后几乎抛弃了她。加持，消失无踪，据真嗣所说，可能在他那愚蠢的追求“真相”之旅中丧生。班长，在明日香因精神侵犯而陷入木僵时撤离，从此杳无音讯。汉斯，温思罗普的下属，她曾试图依附他为保护者，却在温思罗普提拔他并将其调走时冷酷地离开了她。真嗣，在明日香接近温思罗普后，留在波士顿多年……

"Is that what you want, Asuka? I can take them all away. I can take him away. Do you want to be alone?"
这就是你想要的吗，明日香？我可以把他们都带走。我可以把他带走。你想一个人吗？

She hadn't cried, not even the day they buried her Mama. She would not cry now. She would not. 'Don't take him away. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be alone.' "I don't... ...need anyone. My arrangement-"
她没有哭，甚至在埋葬她妈妈的那天也没有。她现在也不会哭。她不会的。'不要带走他。我不想孤单。我不想孤单。' "我不... ...需要任何人。我的安排——"

"Is a hollow shell, that you both fear and expect to collapse at some point. Then what? Water again? Or this time the barrel of a gun in your mouth?" Daniel said quietly, his words hitting Asuka harder than if he'd been shouting them. "Or a twist of hemp like your mother, feet in the air?"
是一个空壳，你们既害怕又期待它随时会崩溃。然后呢？再次沉溺于水中？还是这次换成枪口对准嘴巴？" 丹尼尔轻声说道，他的话比大声喊叫更让飞鸟感到沉重。"或者像你母亲那样，用一根麻绳结束，双脚悬空？

"NO! Nononononono! I...I...STOP IT!"
"不！不不不不不！我...我...停下来！"

"Is that what you want?"
那是你想要的吗？

"SHUT! UP!" Asuka's fist swung wildly at his face. He made no attempt to dodge. The soft meaty slap of her fist on his cheek was louder than the gentle lapping of the small waves. They sat like that for several seconds, Asuka's eyes burning into his over her trembling arm.
"闭嘴！"明日香挥拳猛击他的脸，他丝毫没有躲避的意思。她拳头打在脸颊上的肉感声响，甚至盖过了轻柔的波浪声。两人就这样僵持了几秒，明日香颤抖的手臂上方，她的目光如炬，直刺他的眼底。

Daniel finally spoke. "It hurts, doesn't it? Everyone leaving. If you care about someone, let them get close, you'll just get hurt when they leave, like they always do. So you keep everyone away so you won't get hurt." Asuka's fist finally left his cheek, collapsing limply into her lap. "But you need that contact to live, and to want to keep living, Asuka. Never letting anyone in to avoid getting hurt is like never eating to avoid being poisoned. That's what you've been doing, child, and you're starving yourself to death."
丹尼尔终于开口了：“很痛，对吧？每个人都会离开。如果你在乎某人，让他们靠近，当他们离开时，你就会受伤，就像他们总是做的那样。所以你让所有人都远离，这样你就不会受伤。”明日香的拳头终于从他的脸颊上移开，无力地垂落在她的膝上。“但你需要那种接触来生活，以及想要继续生活，明日香。从不让人进来以避免受伤，就像从不进食以避免中毒一样。这就是你一直在做的，孩子，你正在饿死自己。”

"I don't need it," she whispered.
"我不需要它，"她低声说。

"And a rock feels no pain/ and an island never cries/...I've been there before too, Asuka. More than once. I fought demons and monsters alone for decades, more, so no one else would get hurt. I didn't like who I became. I went to...some very bad places. I didn't turn the anguish inward like you, but outward, and that loosed a terrible evil. Friends pulled me out. People who cared enough about me to face that darkness and bring me out. I built this entire Empire so they and I would never fight alone again. I became a god so I could protect them, and reach out to protect others who suffered. I am not alone. You are not alone."
而岩石感受不到痛苦，岛屿也从不流泪……我也曾到过那里，明日香。不止一次。我独自与恶魔和怪兽战斗了几十年，甚至更久，只为不让他人受到伤害。我不喜欢那样的自己。我曾去过……一些非常黑暗的地方。我没有像你那样将痛苦内化，而是外化，这释放出了可怕的邪恶。是朋友们将我拉了出来。那些足够关心我的人，敢于面对那黑暗，将我带出深渊。我建立了这个帝国，就是为了确保他们和我永远不会再孤军奋战。我成为神，是为了保护他们，也是为了伸出援手，保护那些受苦的人。我并不孤单。你也不孤单。

Asuka refused to lift her eyes from the sand. "You're an emperor. You're a god. I'm not like you."
明日香拒绝将目光从沙地上移开。“你是皇帝，你是神。我和你不一样。”

"'For you have but mistook me all this while; I live with bread like you, feel want, taste grief, need friends: subjected thus, how can you say to me, 'I am a king?'' I may be all those things, Asuka, but I'm still human too. I could be alone. But after a while, I wouldn't even recognize myself. Without the people I love, I wouldn't even want to."
"其实你们一直误会我了；我和你们一样靠面包生活，感受匮乏，品尝悲伤，需要朋友：既然如此，你们怎能对我说，'我是个国王'呢？" 我或许拥有那些身份，飞鸟，但我同样也是人。我可能会孤单。但过不了多久，我甚至会认不出自己。如果没有了我所爱的人，我甚至都不想活下去。

Daniel scooted closer and put his arm around the shaking young woman. "You are not alone. I am with you. He is with you."
丹尼尔挪近了一些，将手臂环绕在颤抖的年轻女子身上。“你并不孤单，我和你在一起，他也在你身边。”

Asuka gave a single bitter laugh. "He left too. He may have come back, but he'll leave again. He always did when I needed him. The first thing he did after we came back from Instrumentality was try to kill me."
明日香发出一声苦涩的笑。“他也离开了。他或许回来了，但还会再次离开。每当我需要他时，他总是这样。我们从人类补完计划回来后，他做的第一件事就是试图杀了我。”

"And the merest touch of your hand on his cheek broke him. His heart is as fragile as yours, Asuka. And the days after the Impact burned a lot out of him. Do you know why he was left in Boston after Hans dropped you?"
你轻轻触碰他脸颊的手就足以让他崩溃。他的心和你的一样脆弱，明日香。冲击之后的日子让他失去了很多。你知道为什么汉斯把你放下后，他留在了波士顿吗？

Asuka shook her head once. "He was just gone one day. Not a word. It was right after I...went to Winthrop, for protection. He ran away because I wouldn't give him what he wanted."
明日香摇了摇头。“他就是有一天突然消失了。一句话也没留下。就在我去温沃特寻求保护之后。他逃走了，因为我没有给他想要的东西。”

"Winthrop came to Shinji and told him that he was going to be giving you his 'personal attentions'. Shinji thought he was just dressing up his intent to rape you. He tried anything, even offered himself as a substitute, if Winthrop would leave you alone. Winthrop just laughed, and sicced the guards on him. Winthrop's guards beat Shinji unconscious and you left with Winthrop on a transport for Berlin the next day. Shinji had a skull fracture, two broken ribs, and a fractured arm. He was unconscious for over a week. Winthrop left him in Boston to keep him thousands of miles from you and any other potential foolish efforts on his part."
温思罗普找到真嗣，告诉他将对你给予“特别关照”。真嗣认为这只是他美化强奸意图的说辞。他尝试了各种方法，甚至提出自己作为替代，只求温思罗普放过你。温思罗普对此嗤之以鼻，并命令守卫对付真嗣。温思罗普的守卫将真嗣打至昏迷，第二天你便与温思罗普一同乘运输机前往柏林。真嗣遭受了颅骨骨折、两根肋骨断裂和手臂骨折，昏迷超过一周。温思罗普将他留在波士顿，让他远离你数千英里，以防他再做出任何愚蠢的举动。

Asuka flinched. She hadn't known that.
明日香吓了一跳。她之前并不知情。

"You have no idea how much that boy has bled for you. You were still mostly out of it for months after the Third Impact. You don't know the things he had to do to keep you both alive. And he didn't leave that note in your room so he could go surrender. He left it as insurance, so if the coup failed, he could try to protest you had nothing to do with it. He did it to protect you. You told him he's all you've got left? You're all he has left too. He thinks he's failed everyone else in his life. Suzuhara-san, Ryoji, Ayanami-san, Major Katsuragi...the old fears have to some extent been burned out of him. You're all he has now, and the one he cares about the most. He's going to try to protect you from anything that might hurt you for the rest of his life. He's not going to let go. Remember Mount Asama. He'd jump headfirst into a live volcano for you. Again."
你根本不知道那个男孩为你流了多少血。第三次冲击后，你昏迷了好几个月。你不知道他为了让你俩活下来不得不做了哪些事。他没在你的房间留下那张纸条是为了去投降。他留下它作为保险，万一政变失败，他可以试图证明你与此无关。他这么做是为了保护你。你告诉他，他是你仅剩的一切？你也是他仅剩的一切。他认为自己已经辜负了生命中的其他人。铃原先生、相田、绫波、葛城少校……那些旧日的恐惧在某种程度上已从他心中燃尽。现在，你成了他唯一的牵挂，也是他最在乎的人。他将会用余生尽力保护你，不让任何可能伤害你的事情发生。他绝不会放手。记得浅间山。他愿意为你一头扎进活火山，再跳一次。

Asuka's voice had all the heat and life of the ashes of a week-old forest fire. "He'll...leave. Everyone does. All I do is hurt him."
明日香的声音就像一周前森林大火的余烬，充满了灼热与生机。“他会……离开的。每个人都会。我所做的只是伤害他。”

"He won't. I won't. Tomorrow I'm going to turn back time and raise the dead for you. And maybe Shinji will surprise you. You are not alone. Numquam Soli, 'Never Alone', the motto of the Imperial Army. And we're on your side now, Asuka. In six months, you'll be her. Think about what that means; you and your betrothed will be telling your mother and all your friends what you're going to be naming your child, while you show off your ring."
他不会。我不会。明天我将为你逆转时光，复活亡者。或许真嗣会给你惊喜。你并不孤单。"永不独行"，帝国陆军的座右铭。现在我们站在你这边，明日香。六个月后，你将成为她。想想这意味着什么；你和你的未婚夫将向你的母亲和所有朋友宣布你们孩子的名字，同时炫耀你的戒指。

"I...can't." 'That can't be me. I don't know how. I'm not worth it. If anyone knew the real me, they'd leave. They'd run.
我……做不到。那不可能是我。我不知道怎么做。我不配。如果有人了解真正的我，他们会离开。他们会逃跑。'

"You will." His arm came away from her shoulders. "I know you can. I know you, somewhat. The Great Asuka Langley Sohryu, at least. You're not the first Asuka I've met. I've talked with and helped others. So I know something about how you might have the strength in you. Bell curves and infinities, you know these well. Most Asukas have that strength. You'd never have survived as long as you have without it."
"你会的。" 他的手臂从她肩上移开。"我知道你能行。我对你有所了解，至少是大名鼎鼎的明日香·兰格雷。你不是我遇到的第一个明日香。我和其他人交谈过，也帮助过他们。所以我了解你可能拥有的力量。正态分布和无限，你对这些了如指掌。大多数明日香都具备这种力量。如果没有它，你不可能存活这么久。"

Asuka's response was silence. Daniel sighed a little.
明日香的回应是一片沉默。丹尼尔轻叹了一声。

"You can be happy, Asuka. I've seen that too." He waved at the sky in general. "I've seen a lot of worlds with Evangelions. Lots of worlds with endings different than yours; Some worse, many much happier. Worlds where you two are together happen fairly often. You are usually..." He smiled gently. "Quite happy together. And your children are wonderful. Usually daughters, but always joys to see. You are always...a great mother."
你可以幸福的，明日香。我也见过那样的场景。"他向天空挥了挥手。"我见过许多有福音战士的世界，许多结局与你不同的世界；有些更糟，但许多都更加幸福。你们俩在一起的世界相当常见。你们通常……"他温和地笑了笑，"非常幸福。而你们的孩子都很棒。通常是女儿，但总是让人感到喜悦。你总是……一个伟大的母亲。"

Asuka finally looked up at him again. Her face under her eyes was slick with tears, though she had not made a sound. "A mother," she said very quietly.
明日香终于再次抬头看向他。尽管她没有发出任何声音，但她的脸颊在眼底滑过泪水的痕迹。“一个母亲，”她极其轻声地说道。

"It's the usual end result of pregnancy." Daniel said with gentle irony. "I'm sorry I made you cry, Asuka. You're holding in a lot of pain, and pulling off the bandage is going to hurt a bit. On the other side of this you'll find everything you've been missing, I promise." He stood up and put his hand out to her. "We will make everything alright. That's what we do."
"这是怀孕的常见结果。"丹尼尔带着温和的讽刺说道，"对不起，让你哭了，明日香。你承受了很多痛苦，撕开绷带会有点疼。但在这之后，你会发现你一直所缺失的一切，我保证。"他站起来，向她伸出手，"我们会把一切都处理好。这就是我们所做的。"

Asuka took his hand and stood up unsteadily. She scrubbed at her face with the back of her hand, erasing the signs of her weakness. 'Damn him.'
明日香握住他的手，摇摇晃晃地站了起来。她用手背擦了擦脸，抹去了脆弱的痕迹。'该死的他。'

"Tomorrow we start turning your world around. By tomorrow night, you'll feel like you're a whole new woman." He grinned briefly. "And my lady wife will be here. I haven't seen my wife in too long. I should introduce you to her. She'll go completely 'mom' at you. You'd get along well, I think. A fellow redhead. And huge bitch, by her own declaration. My Witch Queen." His eyes went far away, and his smile got even bigger. "My undounamata."
明天我们开始让你的世界翻天覆地。到明晚，你会感觉自己焕然一新，如同换了个人似的。"他短暂地咧嘴一笑，"而我亲爱的妻子也会来。我已太久未见我的妻子了。我应该介绍你们认识。她会对你母爱泛滥。我想你们会很合得来，都是红发。而且，用她自己的话说，是个大泼妇。我的女巫王后。"他的目光飘向远方，笑容更加灿烂。"我的无可言喻之人。"

Daniel started slowly walking back towards the beach house. Asuka caught up to his side and fell into step. "That's an unusual name," Asuka said in a low voice. "Is she from some exotic planet of your wild space empire? A green skinned space babe? It'd be the perfect capper to today's weirdness."
丹尼尔开始缓缓地向海滩别墅走去。明日香赶上了他的步伐，与他并肩而行。“那是个不寻常的名字，”明日香低声说道，“她是来自你那狂野太空帝国中的某个异星吗？绿皮肤的太空宝贝？这简直是今天怪异事件的完美收尾。”

Daniel laughed. "Not exactly exotic; she's from Earth too. That's not her name, that's what she is to me. It's a very old Avaloni word. Undounamata: The part without which you are not complete, that gives purpose to life, the complementation of your heart and spirit. She is my other half. The reason I can laugh at gods of chaos and death and madness. The reason I can go on when there is no light."
丹尼尔笑了。“并不算异国情调；她也是地球人。那不是她的名字，而是她对我的意义。这是一个非常古老的阿瓦隆尼亚词汇。Undounamata：那个让你不完整的缺失部分，赋予生活目的，是你心灵与精神的补全。她是我的另一半。是我能嘲笑混沌、死亡和疯狂之神的原因。是我能在没有光明时继续前行的理由。”

He chuckled again. "And it will be an interesting meeting. Her name is Raye."
他再次轻笑道：“这将是一次有趣的会面。她的名字叫雷伊。”

"As long as she doesn't have blue hair," Asuka replied.
"只要她没有蓝头发，" 明日香回答道。

### Chapter 04 同床异梦

丹尼尔为明日香扶着门，两人一同返回。明日香一进门便听到哀伤的大提琴声弥漫在海滨别墅中。她从柜台上拿起枪套和枪，跟随丹尼尔前往音乐的源头——屋内的小图书馆。他们在图书馆门口站了几分钟，沉浸在复杂的旋律中，直到真嗣睁开眼睛，随着最后一个音符的消逝。

巴赫的大提琴组曲第 4 号，降 E 大调。非常出色，真嗣。"丹尼尔轻声鼓掌说道。他朝那深棕色的大提琴点了点头，"看来莱布施托中尉教会了你如何从屋内系统请求物品。

真嗣点头道："就在她几分钟前离开去自己的船舱之前。演奏有助于我思考。我问是否可以从我们的帐篷里取我的大提琴，她立刻就让家庭 BH 系统给我拿了一把。她说她会在早上见我们。"

很好。我一会儿也要走了。得去参加枢密院会议。我大概会在黎明时分，也就是大约 0700 回来。厨房里备足了食材，如果你想做早餐的话，或者可以让家里送来。如果有任何需要或想联系我，就给卢卡斯打电话。

 "卢卡斯？"真嗣问道。

"维菲科勋爵。"丹尼尔说，"莱布斯霍特中尉本应将他介绍给飞鸟，我的私人秘书。他总是知道我在哪里。你们俩休息一下，明天我们会给你们做体检，并开始营救你们失踪的亲友。晚安，我的朋友们。"他后退一步，向他们半鞠躬，然后消失在走廊里。

飞鸟看着他离开，然后转回身面对真嗣。他再次以那种奇特的专注目光看着她一会儿，然后站起来，将大提琴靠在架子上。当他转回身面对她时，飞鸟问道："所以，这是梦吗？"

真嗣摇了摇头。"我不这么认为。这也是我想尝试演奏一小段的原因之一。第四组曲是我所知道的最具技术挑战性的作品之一。我曾在梦中演奏过，但从未有过需要真正思考自己在做什么的梦。这不是梦。"他苦笑一声，"我就是这样告诉自己的。这不是梦，不是心灵统一，也不是发疯。这是真的。"

他绕过她，朝卧室走去。明日香跟了上去，却在门口停下脚步，看着他坐在床沿，凝视着窗外整面外墙的景色。远处依稀可见几座岛屿小屋的灯光。真嗣凝视着远方，但明日香能感觉到他并没有在看那些灯光。

“如果这是真的……我们可以改变很多。他说他能救美里，还有加持，还有……我的母亲。”他抬头看向明日香。“他说你的母亲也是。”

明日香努力控制着自己的表情。"是的，他也这么告诉过我。"她木然地说道。她走到床的另一侧，将枪和枪套放在伸手可及的床头柜里，然后开始脱鞋和衣服。

"他还说，他...或许能够...或许能够救出绫波。甚至是渚薰。或许还能救出所有仍被困在灵魂之环中的人！我...如果他真的能做到...我犯下的那么多错误。他真的能做到吗？"真嗣看着她脱完衣服，钻进被窝，急切地寻求着不可能希望的确认。

她几乎没在听到昔日死敌飞行员的名字时退缩，而真嗣正朝她这边看过来。明日香拒绝与他对视。他眼中的赤裸希望太过刺眼。十六年来一直将那份痛苦深锁心底，与丹尼尔谈论的那些事让她的情感过于脆弱，无法承受这样的目光。十六年的压抑，以及世界末日后四年噩梦般的野蛮生活，希望带来的却是痛苦。

她能感觉到他在背后盯着她，当她蜷缩着背对他时。他不会让她就这样不回答就逃脱的，对吧？"他说他能做到。他只需打个响指就能在不同世界间开启门户，能穿越时间带来我们的分身。为什么怀疑他做不到其他的事呢？" 她终于回应道。

"明日香？他说他能...你的...我知道..." 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

"说出来吧，第三适格者，" 她说。她的头在痛。她的胃在痛。她浑身都痛。

你为什么不兴奋？他说他能让我们母亲复活。我知道失去母亲是什么感觉..." 他犹豫了，知道他们之间关于下一个话题的禁忌已经形成。他试图一口气说出来。"我从人类补完计划中记得，关于...你的母亲。你难道不为此感到高兴吗？

……我不知道。我对这一切都不知道该怎么想。他说了很多事情。

他对你说了什么？

他说..." '"你如同燃烧的城市般散发着痛苦。" "你并不孤单。" "你知道为什么汉斯把你留在波士顿后他还在那里吗？" "你不知道那个男孩为你流了多少血。" "你可以快乐，明日香。"' "他说他能帮助我们，而且他知道我们'故事'的所有细节。" '他仍然认为我们值得帮助。' "也许他真的可以。

你'自己'告诉你什么了？她指的是什么，什么问题？

'"我们喜欢它。我们喜欢他。" "我告诉他...我告诉他是因为我想这么做。因为他应该知道。因为我想让他知道。因为我是…" "你不必再害怕任何事了。你现在被允许快乐。不要错过这个机会。"' "很多难以置信的事情。" '别再问我无法回答的问题了，Third。别再纠缠这些问题了。' "你告诉自己什么？" 她轻声问道。

真嗣沉默了。胜利了。但随后他又开口了。"他说丹尼尔能带回许多我们失去的人...我们认识的所有人...然后丹尼尔告诉我，他将派遣一支帝国军队师团随我们前往，使南美洲的入侵变得简单，然后继续前进，帮助我们重建整个世界...不再有'如果'..."

他说他将归还从我们这里夺走的一切...并告诉我应该..."他又停了下来。然后他更加轻声地，与其说是对她，不如说是对自己说，"'要诚实，要在场，不要害怕'...

沉默再次持续了许久，随后明日香感觉到他把手放在了她的肩上。他的触碰比她温暖，但她只感受到自己刺痛的皮肤。“晚安，明日香。”他的触碰消失了。她听见他脱衣上床。灯光在他们静默良久后熄灭，两人躺在那张巨大柔软的床上，互不触碰，相隔数寸，却仿佛相隔千里。

他们俩都久久未能入睡。

最终，睡意还是征服了他，但真嗣知道自己至少在黑暗中躺了几个小时，凝视着窗外天空，或是又一次陌生的天花板。当他醒来时，外面的天空才刚刚开始泛白，尽管他的身体告诉他时间已经很晚了。他坐起身，望向明日香。她在某个时刻终于在睡梦中翻了个身，他能看到她的脸。她的枕头上有一块湿痕，她又在睡梦中哭泣了。

真嗣暗自叹了口气。自从他们开始同床共枕以来，他通常比她早起，因此这种情景他见得比他愿意的还要多。他想要改变这一切。然而，她仍将他情感上拒之千里。他们只是字面意义上的同床共枕。他曾试图接受她提出的性关系提议，那是他们“关系”中的一部分。结果却是一场可悲的失败。她躺在那里，如同一个会呼吸的人偶，当他试图俯身在她之上时，她那双甚至没有看向他的眼睛里透出的千山万水般的冷漠，让真嗣失去了继续向她靠近的欲望。他只是躺在了她旁边，拉过被子盖住两人。他试图拥抱她，但她却转过身去。他尽量不去听她的抽泣和低声啜泣，躺在那里，同样憎恨着自己。第二天早上，他们彼此没有交谈，尽管她偶尔会提及那个提议依然有效，就像丹尼尔出现前的那个晚上一样。

他确实有道理。这几乎更糟。几乎；这种令人心痛的、近乎讽刺的关系，仍然比之前那些充满痛苦和悔恨的孤独岁月要好。但仍然很痛。真嗣看着她睡觉，希望他能触碰到她，让她再次微笑。当他们在道场练习或玩明日香最喜欢的消遣——电子游戏时，她的脸有时会放松。当真嗣带着更多极其罕见的能用的游戏出现在她的系统前时，她总是显得惊喜。她总是问他为什么要在她的玩具上花这么多钱。他从未当面对她说，这一切都值得，只为看到那一丝微笑，再次听到她用更柔和的声音叫他“笨蛋”。

他把脚从床上伸出来，低头看向昨晚扔衣服的地方。他看到它们时愣住了。它们不是他离开时的样子。他把它们扔在床边，堆成一团。现在它们被整齐地折叠和压平，看起来几乎像新的一样。

碇真嗣弯腰捡起它们。一闻之下便确认了；那是淡淡的洗涤剂香味。无声无息，甚至没有惊醒他，有人竟能在他们熟睡时将衣服取走、清洗、折叠并放回原处。看向床的另一侧，确认了明日香的衣服也受到了同样的待遇。连他们的鞋子都被清洁过了。碇真嗣最终耸了耸肩，去浴室洗澡。'真是奇怪，全套服务的幽灵，'他想。

他走进厨房，打算尽可能做出他们学生时代早餐的味道。快速翻找橱柜和冰箱，轻易就找到了他甚至只是隐约想到可能需要的所有东西。他再次摇头。太诡异了。他甚至有新鲜的鸡蛋、橙汁和西红柿，在第三次冲击后的世界里，这些都是难得的奢侈品。

他听到淋浴开始的声音，等到明日香从卧室出来时，屋子里已经弥漫着烹饪早餐的香味。

"早上好，明日香。" 他得到了一声咕哝和模糊的挥手作为回应。她坐在厨房旁的小桌边，碇真嗣端上了他们的早餐。两人默默地吃着。

终于，明日香显露出一丝生机。“有人来了吗？”

真嗣摇了摇头。“他说大概黎明时分。看来应该快了。”自从他醒来后，外面的天空已经明显亮了许多。“我在想……BH，现在几点了？”

一声轻柔的响声后，一个冷静的合成声音用日语回答道：“提示音后，当地时间将是 0647。”几秒钟后，传来了一声哔响。

“看来我们还有几分钟。”真嗣说。“而且我们还在这里，所以我想这意味着这不是梦。”

明日香坐在那里，凝视着空空如也的盘子。“不是梦，”她重复道，声音毫无起伏。当敲门声响起时，她抬头看去。真嗣打开门，只见莱布施托特中尉站在门口，穿着与昨晚相同的太空黑制服。晨光渐盛，使得她左胸上那一小排战役勋章以及喉部的军衔标志更加清晰可见。

早上好，真嗣，明日香。希望你们在我们这片美好的领域度过的第一晚是宁静的。

真嗣侧身让中尉进来。"早上好，中尉——呃，青。我想我昨晚能睡成那样已经算是不错了。呃，我们是应该去某个地方见丹尼尔，还是就等着他出现？"他问道。

陛下应该很快就会到。我们可能还会有个难得的惊喜。我相信女王陛下也会来短暂停留。他们已经有一段时间没见面了，所以他们的重逢将会是一个有趣的体验。

"是不是应该有什么仪式之类的？" 真嗣问道。

不，没有那种事。但当领主和夫人分开一段时间后，他们通常会非常高兴再次相见。当他们再次相聚时，方圆数里的人都能感受到他们的喜悦。我以前从未有机会见到女王陛下，也没有见过国王陛下，所以我很期待亲眼目睹这一幕。" 她的嘴唇勾起一抹渴望的微笑。"真希望我有个爱人可以一起分享这份喜悦。

真嗣不知道该如何理解这番话。他注意到明日香奇怪的表情。她正盯着中尉，好像突然间对方开始说起了方言。"明日香？你还好吗？"

明日香从恍惚中回过神来，目光猛地转向真嗣。"我...没事，第三。" 她又看向那位帝国官员。"那我们接下来该做什么呢？"

我们都去诊所岛，做个快速体检，然后你和陛下一起回地球执行首次回收任务。这是陛下今早给我的计划。之后，他说看下一步感觉如何再定。昨晚给你太多信息后，他不想一下子让你承受太多。即使是好事，累积太多也不行，他说。

莱布施托特中尉闭上眼睛。"他来了。"她再次睁开眼，对两位 Eva 驾驶员微笑道："我们去迎接他吧。"

"你能...感觉到他来了吗？" 真嗣问道。

她点头。"正是如此。我母亲那边是星际后裔，所以当他靠近时我能感觉到。走吧。"

'星际之子？' 真嗣将这个问题记下以便稍后询问，随后他们跟随她来到了门口。他们鱼贯而出，来到了前一晚抵达的海滩。那奇特弯曲的东边地平线上，第一缕曙光正从平静的海面上缓缓升起。

列兵莱布施托特扫视天空，然后指向一处。"那里。"

真嗣和明日香顺着她的手臂所指的方向望去，却什么也没看见。远处海面上，一只海鸟的白色翅膀依稀可见，除此之外别无他物。

"哪里？我什么也没看到，" 真嗣说。

"是的，只有一只海鸥和很多水。它是不是离我们太远，以至于看不见了？" 飞鸟问。

海鸥？" 莱布斯霍特中尉困惑地看着她。"什么海鸥？

"那里只有那只海鸥，对吧——" 飞鸟的声音渐渐消失。那只海鸥现在变得更加显眼，也远非普通海鸟。翅膀上没有黑色尖端是一个很好的线索，而翅膀间那身宝蓝色斗篷的身影更是表明这不是常见的海鸟。

在一对超过 15 米宽的彩虹色白色翅膀上，他们的主人向岸边翱翔而来。他拉起身体，翅膀向后拍打，迅速降落在离他们不远的海岸线上。他着陆时扬起的沙尘让保持距离的原因一目了然。

真嗣和明日香交换了一个震惊的眼神，然后目不转睛地看着丹尼尔向他们走来，他的翅膀似乎随着他的接近而收进了背部。当他到达他们面前时，翅膀已经消失在他的斗篷下。

"早上好！睡得好吗？" 他兴高采烈地向他们打招呼。

"呃，" 真嗣流畅地回应道。他似乎忘记了如何眨眼。

丹尼尔对他们的目瞪口呆投以一个苦笑。"哎，现在的孩子们。你告诉他们你是来自时空之外的皇帝，他们就点点头。你挥动翅膀飞进来，突然间他们就忘了怎么说话了。"

"呃...翅膀？"是明日香机智的反驳。她的眼睛也没有眨动。

是的，翅膀。通过大量的基因工程，一些新颖的生物压缩技术用于储存，你就拥有了一种在技术、魔法或心灵传送方法不可用或无效的环境中便捷移动的紧凑方式。而且，正如你们两位所体验到的，它们有时确实是给人留下深刻印象的好方法。我将它们编入了阿瓦隆尼斯人的基因组中，因此任何本土出生的帝国人也有它们。" 他向莱布肖特中尉示意，"比如这位好中尉。

明日香和真嗣缓缓转头看向她。她礼貌地对他们微笑。她看向丹尼尔，"早上好，陛下。"

早上好，中尉。今天的事项都准备好了吗？

是的，陛下。女王陛下很快会来与我们汇合吗？

很快。你可能想往后站一点。

哦不，陛下。我无论如何都不会错过这个。我只是希望我也能有这份幸运。

随你便。真嗣，明日香，你们两个准备好了吗？

真嗣和明日香再次交换了一个困惑的眼神。真嗣转回身，向丹尼尔问道：“准备好什么？”

丹尼尔张开嘴正要回答，一道火柱便填满了天空。火柱直冲云霄，高达他们所能见到的极限，落在离他身后二十英尺的地方。火焰逐渐收窄，形成旋风般的尖端，突然完成最后一圈旋转后消失了。在它所描绘的圆圈中心，站着一位高挑、曲线优美的女子，她那长长的红色秀发中穿插着精美的珠宝，身着紧身的绿黑相间的长袍……她正平静地从一团漂浮在旁的蓝色毛线中编织着什么。

丹尼尔带着满心的喜悦，终于说完了：“准备好迎接她的到来。”

阿瓦隆的巫后睁开她那榛色的眼睛，目光锁定在丹尼尔身上。“你好，亲爱的。”

"乌多纳玛塔……"他低声说道，随即向她冲去。丹尼尔奔向她，两人如被大炮发射般猛烈相撞。真嗣目睹了一股无声的冲击波从那对激烈拥抱、亲吻的情侣处扩散开来，形成一个迅速膨胀的圆顶，几乎瞬间将他们淹没。

突然间，他心中充满了喜悦。他的心轻盈如羽毛。泪水开始自由地顺着他的脸颊流淌，当她的手握住他的手时，他的整个身体开始从那触碰处向外发麻。他无法抑制那仿佛要撕裂脸庞的笑容。他还活着，阳光明媚，而她与他同在。永远，永远在他身边。永不分离，永不遗弃。她是他的，他是她的，他们在一起，世界一切安好。他们转向彼此，她的眼睛如同蓝宝石磁铁般将他吸引。他可以在那双眼中迷失自我。他总是如此，一直如此，永远，永远都会……

世界上的一切都不及她重要。他的心跳加速。他向她靠近，头微微倾斜，而她也恰好做出同样的动作。话语在他唇边颤抖。他必须告诉她，必须说些什么。但言语已失去所有力量。无论他说什么，都无法接近表达他对她的感情。他那被压抑的舌头只能勉强说出“A-Asuka...”

她的名字打破了魔咒。她眨了两下眼，脸上那同样巨大的笑容转为困惑。她低下头。真嗣的目光随之移动。他何时握住了她的手？是她做的吗？她猛地抽回手，紧贴在胸前，仿佛被烫伤了一样。“什么……”她用一种迷茫的声音说，“刚才发生了什么？”

“他们已经分开数月。现在，主人和女士重聚了。我明白，分开的时间越长，重逢的效果越强烈。如果超过几年，你们现在可能已经迫不及待地要脱掉对方的衣服了。”中尉莱布肖特的眼中闪着泪光。她深吸一口气。“不可言喻……一即是二，二即是一。我们只是感受到了他们时刻感受到的回声。我希望有一天我也能找到我的另一半。我听说那感觉……美妙极了。”

真嗣在她突然开口时吓了一跳。他们并没有移动，但有那么一刻，他和明日香仿佛是世界上仅存的人。他努力抓住那些迅速消散的感觉。自从……自从……有生以来？他曾有过如此……如此……轻松的感觉吗？心中没有一丝负担，只有一种翱翔的感觉……

明日香脸上的表情看起来更加困惑，就像有人偷走了孩子最心爱的玩具。她显得完全迷失和悲伤。她的脸颊还是湿的，所以真嗣不能确定，但他觉得她可能还在哭泣。她不愿与他对视。他不知道该怎么办。他自己也感到失落和困惑，这让他动弹不得。一种想要将她拥入怀中的冲动，只来得及抬起半只手，她就转过身去，遮住了脸。

丹尼尔和他的妻子终于松开了拥抱，手牵手走回他们身边。在他们身后，编织物和线团像一只听话的小狗一样在空中跳跃。真嗣注意到他们仍然笑容满面，心中不禁掠过一丝羡慕。

重逢总是更美好，当你的爱人来迎接你，无论是在机场还是海边，对吧？" 女士说道，她的声音温暖而低沉。"很高兴见到你们，飞行员们。还有你，莱布斯霍特中尉。

她将真嗣拉入一个短暂的拥抱。一股震撼穿过他的身体，感觉类似于他在狄拉克海中漂浮时母亲手臂伸向他的触感。他站在那里，试图理清这意味着什么，而她则将明日香拉入一个更长的拥抱。他看到明日香颤抖着，犹豫地回应了拥抱，然后紧紧抓住，就像有人抓住救生圈一样。女士在明日香的头发里低语了些什么，然后放开了她。他更清楚地看到了她的脸。她仍在哭泣。她用手背擦了擦脸，而他及时移开了视线，没让她注意到他在盯着她。他知道，根据长期的经验，她讨厌任何人看到她脆弱的样子。他也不愿看到她那样，但出于不同的原因。他讨厌自己总是只是旁观。

"啊...也很高兴见到您，陛下。" 真嗣急忙说道，并深深鞠了一躬。

她轻轻地拍了拍他的头，说道：“既然我丈夫让你直呼其名，我自然也不便坚持这种礼节。请叫我雷耶，真嗣。”

他从鞠躬中起身，一脸困惑。“零？你的名字是零？”这似乎是个奇怪的巧合。

她对他的困惑半带微笑。“也不尽然。如果你愿意，可以叫我雷亚娜，这是简称。和你朋友绫波并不完全一样。”

丹尼尔哼了一声。“确实不太像。”他转向莱布施托特中尉，“中尉，劳驾？”

莱布肖特中尉立刻立正，说道：“遵命，陛下。”她用手指触碰了缠绕在左手腕上、本应佩戴手表位置的宽阔金属带。

真嗣听到一阵微弱的嗡鸣声，一个影子掠过他们头顶。一块带有不协调木质甲板的宽阔金属圆盘从上方缓缓降下，在离他们旁边的沙地几英寸处停稳。

莱布肖特中尉向圆盘挥手，“真嗣，明日香，请上船，我们将前往诊所岛。”

真嗣小心翼翼地踏上圆盘，它丝毫没有因他的重量而摇晃。他感觉自己仿佛踏在坚硬的石头上。明日香紧随其后，其余队员也陆续跟上。待所有人都站上圆盘后，莱布施特中尉再次触碰了手腕上的带子，世界仿佛从他们脚下抽离。真嗣本能地想要抓住什么支撑，但随即停下，意识到尽管眼睛所见在动，内耳却告诉他其实并未移动。

他们以极快的速度上升，却丝毫感觉不到移动。连因移动而产生的风都没有。当高度看起来达到几千米时，他们停止上升，向西飞去。真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，她正俯视着下方飞速掠过的小岛。

我想让你们俩看看这些岛屿，所以今天我们选择了传送盘，而不是直接跳跃或其他方式，"丹尼尔说。"给你们一些空间感，这样你们就不会觉得太'困在岛上了'。如果你们想在地面周围转转，这里有小型摩托车之类的可供使用。

零星的小岛，或独处或成环成群，遍布他们下方的海域。真嗣可以看到远处有较大的开阔水域，但他们正朝着一大片岛群中心的一组较大的岛屿前进。他们的目的地似乎是一个相当大的岛屿，上面有几座较大的低矮建筑。

他们的圆盘像之前一样在一块大草坪前的一座建筑旁停稳，那座建筑上的标志真嗣无法辨认。虽然是用西文字母写的，但并不是英语。标志上的大红十字很容易让人猜到这就是莱布肖特中尉提到的诊所。他们下了圆盘，莱布肖特中尉引导他们走向前门，门在他们走近时自动打开了。

当他们走进去时，真嗣差点撞见了自己。

差点撞上的真嗣转过身来，正要道歉，却同样震惊地瞪大了眼睛。“对不……呃……我？”

“真嗣，那是谁……”另一个明日香从右边的走廊走出来，话说到一半就停住了。

“呃……我……你……”两个真嗣异口同声地说。

“在无限宇宙的连续体中，你遇到自己的次数比你想象的要多，尽管我承认，我没想到会在这里看到另一对你们，真嗣，明日香。”丹尼尔显得有些惊讶。“列布肖特中尉，请务必查明这里的情况。据我所知，他们今天上午的任何类似预约都不应该有重叠。”

"哎呀，陛下，"她轻声回答，随后一边走开一边轻敲手腕上的带子。

呃，"新来的真嗣开始说道，"我想这就是他们所说的。你好。

你，你好。"真嗣的自我感觉开始有些扭曲。"我猜你是来自...另一个世界的我？

一定是...哇。是的。我...我们...我们在第三次冲击后的几年里到了俄罗斯。情况...相当糟糕。"他看着他的明日香。"我...我们被分开了，当我们在，呃，被救，可以说，当我们在被救时，一些俄罗斯军阀正把我吊起来。他们带我们到这里来治疗，并让我们休息一下，然后我们回去重建。呃，你是谁，先生？"他转向丹尼尔。"我认得你盔甲上的徽章。它出现在救我们的飞行战车上。还有，呃，追它的警车上。你是这里的政府官员吗？

...你可以说是的，"丹尼尔在长时间的停顿后干巴巴地说道。他伸出手。"丹尼尔·约瑟夫·奥布莱恩爵士，皇冠骑士，帝国游侠首席，奥布莱恩家族族长，普里马斯特拉国王，万阳之主，光辉领域的统治者，至高无上的宇宙君王，阿瓦隆的皇帝。我就是这里的政府。欢迎来到我的地盘。有什么能为你效劳的吗？

新来的真嗣握住了他的手以示握手。他的眼睛睁得更大，握手也变得更慢，因为他的耳朵跟上了手的动作。"呃..."

他身后的明日香开始瘫倒在地。瑞安娜轻弹手指，一团淡淡的蓝雾围绕着墙边的椅子。在明日香倒下之前，椅子迅速移到她身下。"我想我需要坐下来，"她说。

"您就那么做吧，伊卡里夫人。" 雷亚娜温柔地说道。她从丹尼尔手中接过新真嗣那冰冷的手，轻轻地摇了摇。"请原谅我丈夫利用他众多头衔来逗乐。他有时喜欢这样捉弄人。我是雷亚娜·基利斯·哈特-奥布莱恩女爵，隐秘多维行动中心骑士指挥官，阿瓦隆帝国大学音乐奥秘女主人，帝国至尊女巫，纳里亚大公爵夫人，母怒女士，最神秘的女王，阿瓦隆的巫后。您想喝点什么吗？" 这次是丹尼尔的手指一弹，为真嗣拉来一把椅子让他坐下。

很高兴你回家了，亲爱的，" 丹尼尔对妻子低声说道，他们从把椅子推到摇摇晃晃的新一对旁边后退了一步。"没有你，很难恰到好处地表演那个套路。

"我也爱你，亲爱的。" 她同样轻声回答。真嗣羡慕他的同伴能有椅子坐。他的膝盖虽然更稳，但主人超凡脱俗的种种迹象已经深到足以让他的平衡感也感到压力。他转头查看他的明日香。

她僵硬地静止着，直勾勾地盯着另一个索龙。雷亚娜跪在那个人旁边，对着坐在椅子上茫然的明日香低声说着什么。她站起来，把手放在年轻女子的头上，闭上眼睛低语了几句。雷亚娜转向明日香，示意她靠近。“你的另一个自己想和你说话，明日香。”

明日香稍微走近了一些，坐着的明日香抓住了她的手。她的手冰凉。“别放开你的手，”她低声说道。

 什么？

我离开了那片海滩。我醒来时他不在那里，我以为他抛弃了我。所以我离开了。他只是离开了短短几分钟，他后来找到我时告诉我。那是六年后的事了。在那六年里，我每分每秒都在想我活着的理由是什么。我之所以还活着，只是因为我害怕死亡。

她深吸一口气，继续说道：“我们一找到彼此，我就再次逃跑了。情况变得更糟。一个俄罗斯军阀抓住了我，把我关进了他的后宫。几周后，我设法摆脱了药物的影响，杀了一个守卫逃了出来。我回到了真嗣身边。军阀的手下跟踪我，抓走了真嗣，杀死了斯维特拉娜……我和尤里跟着他们回到了赤塔。我们找到了真嗣，但他已经……”泪水开始滴落在他们紧握的手上。“……奄奄一息。我们给了他慈悲……他在我怀里去世了。不要让你的亲人离开。”

另一个真嗣的手抓住了她的肩膀。“我现在和你在一起，明日香。我再也不会离开你了，永远。”他用一种强烈的语气说道。

她用空着的手抓住他的手，抬头看着他。“那明怎么办？”

真嗣看着他的新分身，问道：“明？”

另一个人一直凝视着他的明日香，但回答了真嗣。"当我在那片海滩失去明日香时，我花了五年时间寻找她，为她哀悼。我以为她死了。我埋葬了每一个看起来有点像她的女性的尸体。最终我……放弃了。我再也做不到。我遇到了一个名叫明的中国女人。在明日香再次找到我的前一天，我向她求婚了。"他的眼神变得阴郁。"那天晚上，一些袭击者找到了我们。他们开枪打我，强奸并杀害了她。明日香和尤里找到了我们，救了我，也试图救她。她死了。"他的声音平淡无奇。

"然后那些好女孩和那个男孩救了你们三个，把万尼亚、斯维特拉娜和我带回了这里，"一个带有中国口音的声音在他们身后说道。一只纤细的手放在了明日香的肩膀上，加入了他们。"我们还活着，还在一起。我们会把剩下的问题解决的，明日香。"这位瘦小的中国女子抬头看着真嗣和明日香。"你们好。我想我知道你们的名字，你们是我朋友的镜像。我叫明·切黄。很高兴见到你们。"她鞠了一躬。

明日香从她的替身那里抽回手，向后退了一步。真嗣一点也不介意这意味着她会撞到他。"什么？我...呃...你好。" "她死了吗？什么？" 真嗣不知道该说什么。他通常依赖明日香鲁莽地与新人打交道。但现在她看起来和他一样震惊。莱布施托特中尉的归来救了他。她手腕上方的屏幕上有一份快速滚动的报告，并向他们读出了摘要。

陛下，昨晚的紧急入院。他们几个小时前才刚到，伤得很重。救援队到达时，他们中活着的比死去的少。他们刚刚把最后一批人抬上来。现在他们对我们来说是安全的。

"救援队？我不记得昨晚有授权任何行动。而且他们的故事与最近受到关注的任何福音战士衍生品都不符。中尉，故事的其余部分是什么？" 丹尼尔冷静地说，扬起了一边的眉毛。

她的唇角勾起一抹浅笑。“那是因为您没有授权，陛下。这并非正式的游侠任务、海军突袭或陆军干预。是那位私生公主和她的两个朋友闯入了男爵 V'Tkanatey 庄园的个人竞选博物馆，偷走了一架过时的帝国海军 MAL-58 悬浮突击登陆艇，并驾驶它兜风。显然，当阿瓦隆市警察开始追捕他们时，他们启动了维度门户发生器。他们穿越到了一个遥远的福音战士变种系列，并出现在俄罗斯赤塔上空，正值两位军阀争夺该城。他们利用 MAL-58 将双方的部队撕裂，并借助其机翼让半个城市的人相信他们正遭受天国的入侵，直到警方的飞行器追上。她利用自己作为私生公主的权威，宣称该地区为新近平定的帝国领土，并强迫他们在允许逮捕她和她的朋友之前，帮助她稳定局势，罪名是‘借用’登陆艇、未经允许让帝国未成年人流亡以及逃学。”

我发誓，你只是在跨维度以太中留下几道涟漪，突然间所有人都不小心撞到了你刚离开的地方，"丹尼尔喃喃自语。"好吧，所以她招募了一群阿瓦隆市的警察来帮助治疗病人，喂养饥饿者，吊死残暴和邪恶之人，让这个地方再次像人类社会一样运转。然后呢？

她借助血之力量复活了这位勇者，召集了一些同样需要复活的家族成员，并让阿瓦隆市警察把她和她的朋友们带回家。警察把伤员带到这里，法官对她严惩不贷。她抗议说那很痛，书砸在头上。'罪与罚'可不是一本小书。法官告诉她：'正是如此。现在或许你会明白，不要在课堂上跳过文学隐喻的讲解。'然后他让他们回到家人身边。显然，他们的家人既愤怒又自豪，还让他们停课一周。

帝国又迎来了一个新的黎明，"丹尼尔叹息道。"三个未成年人，显然试图在成年之前成为游侠。是谁呢？

私生女公主黛安娜·雅典娜·希波吕塔'幸运'李，陛下。私生女公主伯爵夫人雅典娜·丹妮拉·李最小的女儿。还有她的两位同学，伊莉亚'冒险'苏恩海德小姐和巴拉坦'鲁莽'肖拉坎先生。

"又是那三个孩子？看来我得再次和我那年轻的孙女谈谈了。我上次告诉过她，她未成年之前不能成为帝国游侠！还拉着苏恩海德小姐一起？她才十三岁！孩子们！他们快把我逼疯了！" 丹尼尔抱怨道。

"亲爱的，你不是四百毫秒前才说过吗？而且你也清楚，用撬棍也分不开那三个孩子。可以预见，一旦他们成年，那三个孩子就会形成一个三人组。那两个女孩也能看出来。我觉得那个男孩可能看不出来，但这有点可爱。不管怎样，我以为你赞成这种行为，那种近乎疯狂的游侠英雄行为之类的？" 雷亚娜温和地说，一只眉毛轻轻挑起。

我确实这么认为！是她缺乏耐心这一点让人恼火！这女孩就不能像我们这群傻瓜中的大多数一样等到成年吗？唉。好吧，中尉，联系 MilNetCom，看看能否派出一个中型旅前往那个世界帮助伊卡里斯人，并立即派一对二等游侠到这里来接手这个案子。也带上几个游侠学员。

"遵命，陛下。" 她又开始敲击手腕，低声下达命令。

我发誓，有时候这就像管理一个幼儿园一样……" 丹尼尔揉了揉鼻梁。"伊卡里先生，伊卡里女士，一对帝国游侠和他们的学生很快就会到这里来照顾你们。他们会确保你们的需求得到满足，你们的世界恢复正常。听起来你们四位需要一些时间来谈话，如果你们得出结论，我们在这个岛上的小教堂里有一位女神的祭司。

'四个？' 真嗣心想。'但这里只有三个人...难道我们还有隐形人或鬼魂吗？到这个地步，我也不会感到惊讶了。'

三人犹豫地点了点头。丹尼尔话音刚落，真嗣就感到有人轻拍他的肩膀。他转过身，发现一个皮肤黝黑、身穿与丹尼尔相似的金边蓝甲的年轻人站在他们队伍后面，礼貌地对他微笑。“碇真嗣先生？”他询问道。

 呃，是的？

我是二等游侠海勒·麦康奈尔，先生。我的指挥官要求并命令我和我的搭档帮助您的家人进入这里的船舱，并协助您解决您世界的情况。

"啊...不是吧？"真嗣完全不知道该如何开始解释这件事。''你们找的不是我，是那边那个不是我的我，'或许？这听起来还是有点疯狂。'

"这边，Ranger。搞错人了，" 丹尼尔在真嗣身后说道。

"是，长官。抱歉，碇先生。" Ranger 绕过真嗣走了过去。

真嗣感觉比他在传送盘上一千米高空时还要心神不宁。他迅速环顾四周，寻找他的明日香，确认她是他醒来时身边的那个人。他开始担心自己可能会跟错人。他发现她正站在一旁，与雷亚娜低声交谈。明日香仍然盯着她的新分身，但偶尔会迅速点头回应雷亚娜的话。真嗣向她们走去。

"...不是她。她的生活六年前就与你的分道扬镳了。你在这里是安全的。我是母亲之怒的女士。我会像照顾自己的孩子一样守护你，" 雷亚娜说完。

"Asuka，你...你还好吗？" 真嗣问道。

她的目光终于从自己的倒影上移开，与真嗣的目光相遇。"我...我不知道。" 她转过头去。"我以为见到自己已经够奇怪了。如果那是六个月后的'我'...她似乎比我面前的'Asuka'更不同。而且她的世界听起来比我们的还要糟糕。她...我不知道，Sh-..第三。"

'而我...死了？但那不是我，我...' 真嗣摇了摇头。他想抱住 Asuka 让她感觉好些。他想逃跑。他想尖叫。他不知道自己想要什么。"我也不知道该怎么想，Asuka。我们现在该怎么办，Rayana？"

她看了看 Daniel，其他飞行员，以及新到的游骑兵，然后摇了摇头。"我的丈夫会处理这件事几分钟。我带你们两个回检查和治疗室。这边走。" 她又给了 Asuka 一个短暂的拥抱，拉着她朝另一个 Asuka 出现的走廊走去。真嗣回头担忧地看了自己一眼，跟了上去。

### Chapter 05 检查的结果

明日香试图让自己振作起来。又是另一个“她”，这次不那么快乐。她不知道自己还能忍受多少，而不至于尖叫出来。她的故事……如果她当初就那样离开真嗣，离开那片海滩，会发生什么？她从未想过自己会如此怀念温斯洛普的统治。“他……快要死了。我们给了他慈悲……他在我怀里死去。不要让你的（真嗣）离开。”真嗣，死了？“给了他慈悲”？而“她”又如此受影响？明日香用裙子擦去脸上的泪水痕迹。她不需要这些。今天早上已经经历了足够的情感冲击。

在那片海滩上，他们究竟遭遇了什么？那无声的浪潮席卷而来，突然间，她感到一种解脱。她因纯粹的喜悦而开始哭泣。真嗣的手握着她的手，他的目光紧紧锁定着她。他正视着她，真正地注视着她，正如她一直默默梦想的那样。那双深蓝色的眼睛，如同夜空中闪烁的钴蓝色电光，熠熠生辉地凝视着她。他向她微笑，她的心在歌唱。他的声音，结结巴巴地唤着她的名字。她几乎要张开双臂拥抱他，拥抱属于她的他。

随后，现实猛然回归。他们正在做的事情突然意识到了。她猛地抽回手，不知道它是怎么伸到他那里的。从她意识到 Unit-02 中是她母亲的灵魂在与日本自卫队战斗时感受到的极度喜悦，到最低谷的困惑和绝望，这种突如其来的崩溃让她痛苦不堪，就像她打开母亲病房门看到那个玩偶自缢时的糟糕回声。她转过身去，不让真嗣看到她止不住的泪水。她所能做的就是不在沙滩上崩溃。她几乎没听见莱布施托特中尉说话，也没听见皇后向他们打招呼。但青的话一直在她脑海中回响，'我们只是感受到了他们一直感受到的回声。'

接着，皇后拥抱了她，就像止血带一样抚慰着她流血的情感伤口。她感到安全，仿佛再次回到了母亲的怀抱。她像受惊的孩子一样紧紧抓住不放。皇后在她耳边低语，“孩子，你会再次感受到那种感觉的。我发誓，很快。”她声音中的平静和确信足以让明日香振作起来。

但这掌控是脆弱的。热带群岛如海般掠过眼前，却无丝毫动感，这奇景足以让她分心，然而再次遇见自己，这次状态远非积极，几乎又让她崩溃。皇后的拥抱再次带来了安全感，宁静感，但明日香仍需努力保持面容平静。“别让你的他离开”？好像我曾拥有过他。好像我曾拥有过任何人。

皇后领着他们沿走廊走了不远，来到一扇半开的门前，径直走了进去。医院日常活动的这种变化，足以让明日香振作起来，讽刺地想：“当皇后的好处就是，这地方是你的，所以无需敲门。”

实验室里那位美丽的黑发女子，身穿白大褂，本想开口打招呼，却在认出进来的人时惊叫一声，倒吸一口气。她用一种复杂而悦耳的语言说了些什么，连明日香那受过良好教育的多语种耳朵也无法辨识。是带有爱尔兰口音的英语？还是盖尔语？她能听出两者的痕迹，但都不是。

20 世纪的日本地球人，请了，梅特利亚医生。我们的客人昨晚刚到。请为他们进行全面体检，快速治疗，并确保基本安全措施。先从苏琉龙小姐开始。

"啊，是的，陛下。但我以为我们刚处理完他们呢？"医生困惑地看着两位驾驶员。

你们是处理完了。这是另一对。同源不同分支变体。请给予他们最好的关注。为了让你准备好，是的，我的丈夫很快就会加入我们。

梅特利亚医生微微脸红，示意明日香躺在房间中央的检查台上。明日香跳上去，躺了下来。垫子感觉像柔软的记忆棉，温暖而光滑。医生走到一个小讲台后面，更多的悬浮屏幕在她周围形成。明日香可以看到其中一个屏幕上自己的绿色透明图像。她的心跳、心电图以及众多其他生命指标占据了屏幕的其他部分，还有许多她甚至猜不到的指标。

我不用脱衣服吗？"她成功地给了真嗣一个鄙视的眼神。"虽然有些变态可能很想看。

完全不用，苏利云小姐。我们的医疗传感器可以很好地读取您的信息。"她停顿了一下，更仔细地盯着一些读数。"嗯...主要脊神经有轻微神经损伤，左眼、右臂、躯干和腹部有来自交感神经反馈的疤痕...其他部位有轻微神经损伤…中脑腹侧被盖区的影响更严重...神经化学水平有点偏差...血清素和催产素水平非常低，哎呀...最近腹部的枪伤已经基本愈合，经过一些外科修复...旧骨折...有旧营养不良的迹象...但仍然比你的另一个自我好，年轻的女士。她是个受过粗暴对待的女孩。

"我怀孕了吗？"明日香再也忍不住爆发了。

真嗣吓了一跳，然后快速眨眼。那家伙肯定不会以为她在责怪他吧，是吗？又不是他曾经...

"怀孕了？是的，我们已经检查过了，"梅特利亚医生心不在焉地回答。

"什么？"明日香几乎喊了出来。医生显得很吃惊。真嗣看起来快要晕倒了。

皇后也用扬起的眉毛看着医生。"再检查一次，医生。如果她怀孕了，我会知道的，"她平静地说。

梅特利亚医生急忙纠正自己。"哦！对不起，小姐。那是上一个，呃，你。不，你没有怀孕。你怎么可能怀孕呢？你-"

皇后轻轻地清了清嗓子。

- 考虑到你所经历的一切，你是个健康的年轻女孩，但肯定没有怀孕，"梅特利亚医生继续说道，没有停顿。"请保持不动，让我帮你处理一下。

"就这样？"明日香问道。

就这样，小姐，是的。"梅特利亚医生又在讲台上触碰了几处。明日香的视线变暗，随后房间再次清晰起来。"完成了！你现在可以下来了，小姐。碇先生，请您来接替她的位置。

明日香坐起身来。“就这样？”她看向自己的右臂，那条从量产型 Eva 复制品长枪刺穿二号机时留下的细长疤痕已经消失。后颈处持续的疼痛也不见了。她拉出衣领往下看，腹部的疤痕网络和子弹留下的凹痕也消失了。

“就是这样，小姐。你的身体花了好几个月的主观时间来再生受损组织，所以我关闭了你的意识以进行手术。你的身体在加速的时间里大部分已经长回来了，我做了精细调整。你已经昏迷了大约 15 分钟，按照地球时间。你现在感觉如何？”

“我……”明日香停下来思考。她感觉……很好。没有小痛感，左眼也不再模糊。她的头脑感觉……更清晰，不那么分心。就像她一直在脑海深处苦苦思索某个问题，突然间停止了在这上面的无谓思考。“我感觉很好。”她微笑着说。

她注意到真嗣正用一种奇怪的表情盯着她。“怎么，我头发上有东西吗，第三？”

真嗣摇了摇头，低头看着自己的脚趾，嘴里嘟囔着什么。明日香叹了口气。有些事情从未改变。要让第三适格者变成一个结结巴巴、满脸通红的小可怜，还是不需要太多功夫。他拖着步子走到桌边替换她，全程不时用眼角余光偷瞄她，却突然间似乎很难直视她的脸。

明日香对他的这种回归经典“老真嗣”行为嗤之以鼻。这让她回忆起那些更明媚的日子，那时她唯一需要担心的是使徒终结世界。当然，她一生都在训练，驾驶世界上最先进的战争机器与使徒战斗。那些更明媚的日子，她是王牌驾驶员，保护人类，是地球上最伟大表演的明星。甚至那时的真嗣也更有趣，如此容易捉弄。那时，她只需要穿一件宽松的上衣，在他面前弯下腰，就能让他彻底失去思考能力。呵呵。总是能逗人发笑，也暗自兴奋。

她看着他躺回桌上，医生梅特利亚开始进行扫描。她几乎要笑出声来，因为他看起来如此紧张。讲台周围漂浮的屏幕显示他的心跳明显加快了不少。

"好了，让我们来看看你的情况，碇君。腹侧被盖区同样有神经损伤的影响...还是那些营养不良的迹象...血清素和催产素水平也非常低，他们到底让你参加了什么样的驾驶训练？...几根旧肋骨、手臂、线性颅骨骨折，哎呀..." 梅特利亚医生越说越感到沮丧。

明日香皱了皱眉。'对不起，真嗣！我之前不知道！'

一些非常奇怪的神经化学和心理灵性后遗症...索龙君也有，但你的情况严重得多，碇君。你到底经历了什么？哎呀...好吧，保持不动，碇君，我们也会把你治好的。

她再次轻敲讲台，真嗣的眼睛闭上了。他的身体周围出现了一圈金色光晕，明日香听到一种逐渐升高的嗡嗡声开始响起。她对真嗣感到担忧，但自己刚刚经历过的那一切……平息了……她的……思绪。

 她的思绪。

她感觉到自己的心跳再次加速。她担心真嗣。她担心真嗣？什么？她什么时候开始……从未有意识地……为什么她的情绪突然变得好多了？他们对她的大脑做了什么？他们对她做了什么？！

她感觉到女皇的手放在她的手臂上，抬头望进充满关切的双眼。“明日香，我能看到你的气场从快乐变为担忧，再到接近恐慌，我想我知道原因。别担心。我们没有给你下药，也没有未经允许就改变你的思维。我们发誓不会对你的思维做任何事情。”

明日香的脉搏稍稍放缓。那位女士流露出的母性关怀，犹如一层温暖的毯子包裹着她的心。"好吧。那到底是怎么回事？为什么我突然感到担忧...或者说，感觉不一样了？"

你记得 Metelya 医生提到过你的血清素和催产素水平吗？这两种关键的神经化学物质与幸福感、快乐、性欲、社交识别、配对结合以及焦虑感有关。你已经习惯了血清素和催产素水平很低，当医生将它们提升回正常水平时，你突然感觉好多了。

她轻捏了一下明日香的肩膀，然后收回了手。"接下来的这一两天，你会感到更快乐、更开放，可能还会更加性欲旺盛。注意控制最后这一点。过几天，你自身的神经递质分泌就会超过检查带来的提升效果。那时你的感受将取决于你的心态。如果你感觉良好，你可能根本不会注意到效果的消退。如果你情绪低落，水平可能会回落到原来的状态。"

皇后微笑着说：“我们这里非常重视自由意志，飞鸟。我们不会剥夺你的自由。恰恰相反，我们会尽可能地恢复你的选择自由。”

“如果我选择保持原样呢？我……无论我有什么感受，我都不希望它永远被怀疑只是我的神经化学物质被调整的结果！”飞鸟急切地说。

“无论你选择什么，孩子。在做出选择时拥有清晰的头脑几乎不会有害。这只是一种……情感支撑，让你重新站稳脚跟。接下来几天你的所作所为和感受，以及你未来的方向，都完全取决于你。你一直承受着许多心灵上的创伤和伤害。你不必再害怕了。你现在有权快乐。”

个人的精神自由去追求幸福和正义，可以说是我们的指路明灯，明日香，"丹尼尔说着，关上了身后的门。"做正确的事，因为那是正确的。为朋友做好事通常是一个不错的额外奖励。这次我们会和你一起跑。你再也不用害怕任何事了。如果我们做了什么，你以后想改，我们总是可以改的。你现在感觉怎么样？

我想还不错。"明日香伸了个懒腰，感觉自己的背咔嚓作响。"比很久以来都要好。

那就好。因为真嗣一完成，就到时候了。

明日香的心又开始跳得更快了。这一切真的要发生了。"到时候了？"

治愈循环的嗡鸣声开始减弱并消失在她身后，金色的光芒逐渐黯淡。真嗣坐起身，微笑着说：“哇……我感觉……相当不错……”

丹尼尔点头道：“是时候去救你的母亲们了。”

.

.

他们从诊所前门走出，距离到达不到一个小时。大厅里其他与他们相似的身影已经不见了，但一个穿着皇家蓝盔甲的年轻女孩——明日香推测那一定是帝国游骑兵的制服——正在外面等候他们。当他们走近时，她向丹尼尔敬礼。“早上好，陛下们。二等游骑兵麦克康奈尔请求报告，碇一伙已被安置在 C431 号小屋，第 3021 中型机械化旅正在动员，将在 48 小时内出发前往他们的世界。他在您离开后不久就与其他游骑兵一起前往进行先期侦察了。”

丹尼尔回敬了一个礼。“很好，冯·梅尔维茨学员。快去赶上他们。请通过你的协调员链定期报告，如果可以的话。他们会确保任何重要信息都能传达给我。祝狩猎愉快。”

"是的，先生。"一个漆黑的传送门在她身后如虹膜般展开。她再次敬礼，然后迈了进去。

她多大了？"明日香好奇地问道。"她看起来比我还年轻。

"确实如此。游骑兵学员冯·梅尔维茨刚过十五岁。她在十五岁生日那天就报名成为学员。在帝国，十六岁是法定成年年龄，但大多数地方，以及所有的帝国服务机构，都有学员项目，如果你已经确定了自己的方向，你可以提前报名开始训练。"丹尼尔说。

"你认识她？"真嗣问道。

"从未见过她，直到此刻。但在此情形下，我不只是她的君主，更是她的最高军事指挥官。游骑兵队长是我的第二职责。所有学员的录取都必须经过我的办公室批准。我记得几个月前看过她的档案。第一代帝国出生，父母是来自一个由德波联合帝国统治大部分欧亚地区的世界的移民。与我们关系友好，因此移民并不困难。他们的第一个在这里出生的女儿，在符合资格的第一天就尝试加入帝国游骑兵，这相当有抱负。我们昨晚那位小捣蛋公主，再过一年也可以申请了，但她就是缺乏耐心，"丹尼尔回答道。

他们停在了传送盘降落的地方。传送盘已不见踪影，取而代之的是一张小桌，上面放着一把熟悉的装在枪套里的手枪。丹尼尔拿起它递给飞鸟。"是时候进入荒野地带了，孩子们。系好安全带，我们出发。"

明日香拿起手枪，凝视了一会儿。她耸了耸肩，将腰带扣上。它轻易地套在了她的长裙上。'谁知道呢，或许我能射中一个本就该死却从未有机会对付的人，'她想。她看向真嗣，他正注视着她...还微笑着。他的笑容真的很可爱。当她感到自己快要回以微笑时，她咬了咬脸颊内侧。'现在不行，该死。别像个傻乎乎的女学生似的。妈妈！'她看向丹尼尔，点了点头。"准备好了。"

另一个黑色传送门在他们旁边开启，丹尼尔率先走了进去。雷亚娜紧随其后，他们一同踏入黑暗之中。

---
### Chapter 05.1 想要遗忘的瞬间

明日香的视线清晰起来，再次看到了那个熟悉的帐篷内部，依旧被传送门这一侧的金色光芒照得通亮。太过熟悉了；她一天前留在地上的半满背包仍然在那里。从帐篷半开的门向外一瞥，确认外面仍是漆黑一片。

难道没有人注意到我们不见了吗？舰队本应在早晨起航，"明日香焦虑地环顾四周。"帐篷应该已经被拆除了，我们现在应该都在海上才对。

他们还没来得及注意到任何事情。这只是我们的返回点。我刚在我们离开后不久就把我们带回来了。这里仍然是日落后的一个小时。你只离开了大约十秒钟，"丹尼尔回答道。"现在是时候开始我们来这里的目的了；拯救母亲们。真嗣，你和雷亚娜一起。明日香，你跟我来。我们完成任务后再汇合，然后返回岛屿。

女皇点了点头，把手放在真嗣的肩上，两人随即消失不见。

"等等，我——" 明日香说道，但已经太迟了。她意识到自己的失态，身体前倾，一只手半举着。这是自政变以来他们第一次分开。

突然感到焦虑，因为他不在附近了？我理解那种感觉，明日香。以前每次随军出征时，我都会有这种感觉。" 丹尼尔温柔地将手放在她的肩上。"让我们去消除一些加诸于你的伤害吧。

帐篷再次空无一人。

他们出现在一个明日香熟悉的地方，但记忆中并不愉快；温沃普的卧室。那个她为了生存而做出可怕事情的地方。仅仅是再次来到这里，她的皮肤就感到一阵阵发麻。

"我们在这里做什么？这救不了我母亲。我不认为温思罗普曾带她来过这里，"她说着，交叉双臂摩擦肩膀，仿佛能驱散这个地方带来的心理寒意。

中途停留而已。今晚我们要救的不只是你母亲的灵魂，明日香，"丹尼尔说。"我已经屏蔽了我们的存在感，所以不用担心他们看到或听到我们。

"谁？"明日香刚问出口，门就打开了。她看着自己再次走进房间。紧随其后的是温思罗普，手里拿着一杯威士忌。

明日香感到内脏一阵扭曲。她现在完全清楚他们所处的时间点。三年前，温思罗普第一次带她上床的那晚。那不是强奸，不完全算，因为明日香主动接近了他，请求"保护"。他曾提拔了上一个她试图依附的保护者汉斯，汉斯在欣然接受晋升时说"这无关个人情感"，并不在乎这意味着让她别无选择，只能"自愿"去找温思罗普。

"我不想看到这个，丹尼尔。我知道今晚这里会发生什么，" 明日香说道，牙齿紧咬。

"是吗？你对这个夜晚记得些什么？" 丹尼尔平静地说。

我那时甚至不满十六岁！我没有其他选择！你以为这是我想要失去童贞的方式吗？" 明日香喊道，"为了一个满手血腥的独裁者，只是为了让他不至于直接射杀我们？为了一个只要我稍有冒犯就能置我于死地，把女人当作物品的男人？

 你记得什么？

 这个！

"别告诉我你自以为知道的事情，明日香！告诉我你记得的。"丹尼尔更加激动地说。

我记得这一幕，和他一起走进房间。"明日香看着自己站在床边，双手颤抖。"他坐在椅子上，命令我脱衣服上床。"他们看着温斯洛坐进椅子，轻蔑地向明日香下达命令。"我照做了。然后他...脱了衣服，压在我身上...做了他带我来这里的目的。

他们看着房间里的场景随着她的描述展开。明日香无法忍受。她不打算再次目睹这一切发生。她的手垂向腰间手枪的握把。这就是丹尼尔在离开阿瓦隆之前确保给她枪的原因吗？她肯定要使用它了。

她的手刚握住手枪，正要拔出时，就感觉到丹尼尔的手阻止了她。"好，暂停！"他坚定地说。温沃思僵住了。床上的飞鸟也僵住了。墙上的钟摆和壁炉中的火焰都凝固了。房间瞬间寂静无声。

"我告诉过你，我会把从你那里夺走的一切都还给你。这就是我们开始的地方。对不起，我现在不能让你射杀他，因为你以后还得这么做。我不能完全改变你记忆中的事情。我们的记忆定义了我们。如果我改变了你实际记得的关于你过去的事情，那就会改变现在的你，我就会和另一个人交谈，"丹尼尔有些悲伤地说。

"那我们为什么在这里?!"飞鸟对着他的脸尖叫。

飞鸟，你是个天才，十四岁前就精通三种语言并拥有大学学位。别只顾反应，动动脑筋。我说过我会帮助你。你认为我会带我们来到这里，只是为了目睹你一生中最糟糕的夜晚之一吗？我们在这里是为了'保护你的贞洁'。

这他妈是什么意思？

明日香，你是处女。

不，我不是！这就是我们正在看的！

是的，你是。这就是我可爱的妻子轻咳一声的原因，为了阻止医生在那一刻引入更多混乱。但这就是为什么我们先绕道这里再去见你母亲的原因。你不可能怀孕，因为你从未有过性行为。实际上，你的处女膜还是完好的。

明日香困惑地盯着丹尼尔，摇着头说：“但是……但是我……温思罗普让我在他的床上待了一年多！然后他又把我踢出去，让我在神无身边又待了近两年！”

“而且每次他们来找你发生关系时，你都在真正进入之前昏过去，对吧？”

“……你怎么知道的？”

“因为我们即将让它发生。看着。”丹尼尔走到床边，温思罗普庞大的身躯悬在明日香张开的双腿之间。她的身体周围笼罩着一层淡淡的蓝雾，床上的女孩从温思罗普身下飘出，悬在床旁。丹尼尔将手掌平放在她的头部高度，然后沿着她的身体一直扫到脚趾。当他这样做时，另一个明日香以相同的姿势出现在他们旁边的空中。蓝雾包围了新的复制体，丹尼尔引导它回到第一个女孩躺着的位置。丹尼尔脱下斗篷，把它裹在仍然漂浮的女孩身上，将她旋转成垂直姿势。

"好了，她已经披上斗篷和我们在一起了，替补选手也上场了。比赛开始！"时钟重新开始滴答作响，温沃斯开始猛烈地推进。床上的复制版明日香静静躺着，只是眨眼和呼吸，勉强维持着生命的假象。

原本的女孩，现在站在丹尼尔身边，裹着他的斗篷，突然眨了眨眼，环顾四周。她看起来很不高兴，对眼前的一切感到非常困惑。"什...什么鬼？！你...你是谁？还有谁——"她停了下来，先是盯着床上的自己，然后又看向床尾持枪的明日香。"什么？什么？我...我？"

当丹尼尔触碰她的肩膀时，她吓了一跳。"对不起，明日香，这里面涉及到了一点时间旅行。你的未来自我和我来这里是为了阻止温沃斯从你这里夺走他无权得到的东西。嗨，我叫丹尼尔。"他向她伸出手。

裹着斗篷的明日香看了看他的手，又看了看他的脸，再看了看她持枪的另一个自己，然后用双手抓住自己的头发。"我正在经历一场可怕的噩梦。我要被这一切逼疯了……"

丹尼尔松开手，叹了口气。他向飞鸟招手，示意她靠近。“飞鸟，请说服自己，你没有疯，你就是你所看到的样子。”

飞鸟走近一步，抓住自己的肩膀，转过身来。“听着，‘我’，别慌。我就是你。对我来说，这是三年前。昨晚，这个男人从一个发光传送门里出现，自称是过路的神，告诉我还有第三适格者，他是来帮我们救妈妈的。就在这之后，另一个来自未来的我……哦，算了，太混乱了。简而言之：我就是你。我来自未来，我们似乎是为了阻止我不得不和温斯洛普或神奈发生关系。”她向丹尼尔投去一个不满的眼神。“如果能提前知道这些就好了。”

“但是……但是……如果你是来自未来的我，为什么这会是个意外？你怎么不记得这些？”披着斗篷的飞鸟勉强问道。“过路的神？什么？”

飞鸟又向丹尼尔投去一个不满的眼神。“是的，为什么我不记得这些？每次我都昏过去了。这是你的手笔，我猜？”

丹尼尔点了点头。“你记得必须做出选择来到这里，接下来的几年里，你还基于‘得知’今晚起将被迫陷入性奴役这一‘知识’做出了许多其他决定。这一‘知识’在接下来的几年里极大地塑造了你的生活。我无法改变那一点。但我可以消除你认为它产生的大部分影响。”他直视着披着斗篷的飞鸟的眼睛。“对不起，但直到你遇见我之前，你将无法完全记得这次谈话或任何其他谈话。如果这加剧了你对性的心理问题，我真的很抱歉。如果做得恰当，这其实是很有趣的。等着看和你真正关心的人一起时是什么样子吧。”

年轻的飞鸟已经停止了颤抖，但似乎仍然不知道该说什么。“我……其他谈话？你还会再这样做吗？”

每一次都是如此。你为了生存不得不考虑采取这种行动，本身就是极大的不公。你已经承受了足够的痛苦，明日香。我不会让温斯洛这样的野蛮人或如阵内这样的狡猾之徒，在死亡的威胁下夺走你的贞操。这是你应能自由选择给予谁、何时给予、因何给予的独特礼物。作为你自由做出的选择，而非作为保命的筹码。我将从此处顺流而下，每当这种情况发生时，我都会拉动这个开关。你将再次与真嗣相遇，如同你离开第三新东京市时一样完整无缺。

"那我什么时候能记起这一切？"年长的明日香尖锐地问道。

只要你决定是否愿意与我一同经历接下来数百次的这种例行公事。从你的视角来看，我只需一瞬间就能回到这里与你重逢。

明日香停顿了一下。"你走吧。如果你要让这一切不发生，我不想再记得比现在更多的了。"

好吧，你不会说俄语，对吧？

两位明日香都盯着他。年长的那位终于开口了：“不会，怎么了？”

"这是鸡的嘲笑。" 丹尼尔消失了。

年长的明日香抓住自己的头。那句话在她脑海中打开了一扇紧锁的门，一波隐藏的记忆涌了出来。感觉就像有人在她脑中打开了消防水带。“呃。”

另一个明日香将她瞪大的眼睛从丹尼尔曾站立的空气裂缝处移开。她朝温斯洛仍在猛烈攻击的假人床上看了一会儿，然后转头看向未来的自己。“好吧，这到底是怎么回事？”

“嗯……我现在想起来了。全部。天啊……每次他们快要插入我时，他就会出现，换上一个假人，然后在我离开前掩盖我的记忆。至少有几百次了。现在我还头疼得厉害。”

丹尼尔再次出现。“都搞定了。”

两个女孩都吓了一跳。“啊！现在连心脏病都要犯了！”“啊！别这样！”

对不起。你的贞洁已恢复，明日香。是时候结束这里的事情，去救你的母亲了。

"你...你要去救妈妈吗？" 披着斗篷的女孩问道。

明日香点了点头。"是的。他说他会帮助我们。这是最关键的一次。"

"...那么这一切都是值得的。你现在要把我放回去了吗？" 年幼的明日香指着床说道。温思罗普发出一连串的咕哝声后，从假人身上滚了下来。

"是的。首先，让我们彻底把他打晕。"Daniel 打了个响指，Winthrop 的眼皮便垂了下来。"然后把你换回来……"假人飘到了一边。

年轻女孩将斗篷递给 Daniel 后躺下，"好了，开始吧。然后去救妈妈。"

"你不会记得中间发生的事，Asuka，但当我出现时，你会记起一切。下次见。"他把手放在她的额头上，她的眼睛随之闭上。

Asuka 看着过去的自己渐渐入睡。仍有件事困扰着她。"如果这一切第一次发生时，为什么我会醒来时感到酸痛和不适？床单上甚至有血迹。那不是我的幻觉。"

丹尼尔将手移至熟睡女孩的腹股沟上方，悬停着。他的手微微发光了一秒，床单上出现了一滩血迹。“适当的组织明天早上会感到疼痛和发炎，是的。为了维持这个假象。”他起身走回床角她的位置。“但你从未被强奸，飞鸟。那对你的罪行已被洗清。”

飞鸟看着床边仍漂浮着的假人。“那她呢？”

"那个。这是我很久以前专门为此类情况设计的工具。" 他再次打了个响指，假人便消失了。"里面内置了许多有趣的把戏。动作逼真到足以迷惑目标，但又尽可能地减少快感。她的‘阴道分泌物’中充满了微型研磨剂，会撕裂他的私处，同时还会通过化学手段对目标造成一系列恶劣影响；降低中枢神经功能，增加攻击性和偏执，降低智力，削弱免疫系统，并破坏他行为中涉及的关键功能神经。他最后不是因为对你失去兴趣才把你赶出床的。经过几百次这种剂量后，他基本上已经完全性无能了。无论他怎么尝试，他再也没有过性生活。然后你就有机会朝他头上开枪了。不错的复仇，嗯？"

明日香的笑容微小而扭曲，却很确定。"哼，活该。混蛋。" "所以我现在又成了处女？还是说，现在怎么办？" 她僵硬了。她和第三适格者的"约定"。该死。她甚至在那晚丹尼尔出现之前就提出过性关系。真嗣只尝试过和她做一次。结果并不好。她脑海中不断浮现出温沃斯以同样的方式压在她身上的画面。她不得不移开视线。她一直在等待黑暗吞噬她，就像以往那样。但黑暗并未降临。真嗣在开始之前就停了下来，然后离开了她。他甚至不想要她。没有人想要她。他再次拒绝了她，就像他们很久以前的那个吻一样。她从他身边滚开，没能忍住泪水。她仍然时不时地提出这个建议，担心如果不提供这个选项，他会离开，但他再也没有碰过她。

但现在整个世界都变了。该死。她想坐下来思考。她想喝一杯。她想和青谈谈。她想要...妈妈。她猛地抬起头。现在。就是现在。

我们去接我妈妈吧。

丹尼尔微笑着说："如你所愿。" 他打了个响指。

房间里静悄悄的，只有时钟的滴答声和温思罗普的鼾声。

他们出现在医院的走廊里，淡淡的背景中传来广播呼叫和医疗监护仪的声音，夹杂着消毒水和地板清洁剂的气味。对于明日香来说，这条走廊再次变得异常熟悉。这家医院。自从她母亲在与二号机的接触实验中受伤后，她经常来这里。但从那以后就再也没有来过……自从她被命名为第二适格者那天起。

她看着他们所站房间门上的号码牌。303 号。她母亲的房间。"这就是那一天，对吧？" 明日香轻声问道。

是的。我们来得比你跑进来的时候早一点。我不能太早行动。如果我提取你母亲剩余的灵魂，她的身体就会死去。" 他把手放在她的肩膀上。"你不必非得进来。如果你不想再次目睹这一切，我理解。

明日香闭上了眼睛。“谢谢你。”

他的手从她的肩膀上移开，然后穿过了那扇紧闭的门。

明日香能透过门听到母亲的声音。她几乎能听清母亲在说什么。明日香移到走廊的另一边，用手捂住耳朵。她不想再听。她已经知道母亲在说什么了。她已经在太多噩梦中，以及在第三次冲击的诡异时刻听过太多次，在那个人类集体意识中，母亲在自杀前疯狂的呓语如同鞭子般抽打着明日香的内心，撕裂了她所有的内在防御，直到她崩溃哭泣，乞求与母亲一同死去，只为了不再孤单。她再也不需要听到这些。永远不要。

她刚刚开始担心，自己可能得开始哼唱，以确保能盖过任何可能的噪音，这时丹尼尔又从门口走进了走廊。他手里拿着一个发着白光的球体。明日香试图集中注意力去看它，但仅仅是尝试就让她的眼睛流泪。它看起来是三维的，实体的，但又像是她试图看到一个不存在的拐角后的半真半假的物体。

"那是..." 明日香的话音渐渐消失。她甚至不知道该问什么。'她？她的灵魂？妈妈？'

丹尼尔点了点头。"所有不属于肉体的部分。至少留在她体内的那部分。我不知道你能看到多少，但你可能能看出它是不完整的。"

而她的其余部分在二号机的核心里吗？

在第三次冲击后转世重生。这解释了你看到的视频中她奇怪的行为。她带着一个不完整的灵魂转世。她会像在这里一样扭曲，只是方向相反。一旦我将她灵魂的碎片重新融合，她应该就会变回你记忆中事故发生前的母亲。

明日香伸出手向着光芒，却又犹豫了。"我可以触摸它吗？"

请便。要温柔。这种感觉应该和你驾驶的 EVA 单元相似。

明日香将手伸进光芒中，寻找着表面。她的指尖触碰到了一个光滑的表面，没有任何可辨别的纹理。它感觉温暖而熟悉，很像她回忆中与失落的二号机同步时的感觉。这也是她记得在对抗量产型 EVA 时疯狂攻击时的感觉。"妈妈..."她轻声说道。

她收回手，看向丹尼尔。“现在怎么办？”

他双手合拢，将发光的球体围住。当他再次张开手时，一颗核桃大小的钻石躺在他的右手掌心，中心同样闪烁着光芒。他将它放入腰间的小袋中。“我们去柏林司法大楼地下室的牢房，救出你母亲转世的身体和她的其他灵魂。然后我开始着手真正棘手的部分；将她灵魂的碎片重新融合为一体。”

 “我们走吧。”

片刻之后，一个红发小女孩跑进空荡荡的走廊，告诉妈妈她几个月来听到的最好的消息。然后她打开 303 房间的门，尖叫起来。不停地尖叫。

### Chapter 06.1 Mothers

A note before we start: The scene with Asuka and Daniel in the tent was the very first scene I wrote, because it wouldn't leave me alone. Then I had to go back and write everything before it to catch up. Then I wanted to see where it went. So please forgive if this section is rough, it is very truly the earliest.
在我们开始之前的一个说明：帐篷里阿苏卡和丹尼尔的场景是我写的第一场戏，因为它一直挥之不去。然后我不得不回头去写之前的所有内容以赶上进度。接着我想看看它会发展到哪里。所以如果这一部分显得粗糙，请见谅，它确实是最早期的作品。

Rayana and Shinji appeared on a hill above a gigantic crater. Shinji looked down and immediately recognized the vast, kilometers deep pit where the Geofront had once been. They were overlooking the ruins of Tokyo-3. Rayana waved her hand, and a window appeared in the air in front of them. Through it, Shinji could see his nightmares.
蕾雅娜和真嗣出现在一个巨大的陨石坑上方的小山上。真嗣向下望去，立刻认出了那个深达数公里、曾经是地下都市的巨大坑洞。他们俯瞰着东京-3 的废墟。蕾雅娜挥了挥手，一个窗口出现在他们面前的空气中。透过它，真嗣看到了他的噩梦。

He watched a titanic Rei Ayanami gather all the souls of humanity into a ball surrounding the Black Moon that had risen from under Tokyo-3. He watched Evangelion Unit-01, with him inside, be absorbed by the vast white body and then erupt from Ayanami's eye. He saw Unit-01 drift away into space, the unraveled Lance of Longinus spinning in front of it. He closed his eyes. He saw all that in his sleep too many nights. The ones where he merely had to watch Misato die or listen to Asuka be violated by Arael or fight the Mass Production Series alone were no better, but there the other nights.
他目睹了巨大的绫波丽将所有人类的灵魂聚集成一个球体，围绕着从东京-3 下方升起的黑月。他看到自己驾驶的 EVA 初号机被巨大的白色身躯吸收，然后从绫波丽的眼睛中爆发出来。他看到初号机漂向太空，解开的朗基努斯之枪在它前面旋转。他闭上了眼睛。他在太多夜晚的睡梦中也看到了这一切。那些他只能眼睁睁看着美里死去，或是听着明日香被阿拉尔侵犯，或是独自对抗量产机系列的夜晚，同样糟糕，但还有其他那些夜晚。

"I'm not trying to give you flashbacks to old horrors, Shinji. I'm getting a lock on Eva Unit-01's trajectory and speed, so we can just skip to where it is now in 2020," Rayana said apologetically. "Got it." The window disappeared, and she looked up at the sky. She put her hand back on Shinji's shoulder. And the ground dropped away again.
"我不是想让你回忆起过去的恐怖，真嗣。我正在锁定初号机的轨迹和速度，这样我们就可以直接跳转到它在 2020 年的位置。" 雷亚娜歉意地说道，"明白了。" 窗口消失了，她抬头望向天空，再次将手放在真嗣的肩上。地面再次迅速远离。

They shot upwards faster than a speeding bullet. Shinji looked down and saw the Second- and Third Impact-diminished coastline of Japan rapidly shrink behind them. They accelerated some more, and the moon quickly flashed by, blackness and stars before them.
他们以比子弹还快的速度向上冲去。真嗣低头望去，看到因第二次和第三次冲击而缩小的日本海岸线迅速在身后缩小。他们进一步加速，月亮迅速闪过，眼前是无尽的黑暗和繁星。

For a panicked moment Shinji thought about holding his breath, but then realized he probably didn't need to worry. He was already moving faster than he'd ever seen any human vehicle go and the moon was dwindling behind him. Breathable air likely wasn't a problem when the woman holding his shoulder had casually introduced herself to another world's copy of himself as 'Imperial Sorceress Supreme'.
有那么一瞬间，真嗣惊慌地想屏住呼吸，但随即意识到自己可能无需担忧。他正以超越任何人类交通工具的速度移动，而月球正在他身后逐渐缩小。既然那位轻描淡写地向另一个世界的自己介绍自己是“帝国至高魔法师”的女性正抓着他的肩膀，呼吸空气大概不成问题。

Shinji turned his head to catch sight of a distant reddish blur shooting past to their left that might have been Mars. Looking back forward, he could just see the instantly recognizable rings of Saturn coming into view far ahead. A few moments later, Rayana pointed. "There she is."
真嗣转头望去，只见一道遥远的红色模糊掠过左侧，那或许是火星。他回过头向前看，远处隐约可见的土星环正逐渐映入眼帘。片刻之后，雷亚娜指向前方，“她就在那儿。”

Shinji couldn't see anything but pitch blackness. Then it seemed like Unit-01 rushed forward out of space to hang right in their face. The Lance spun lazily between them. Rayana moved them up and closed the gap until they hung within arm's reach of Unit-01's Core.
真嗣眼前一片漆黑，什么也看不见。突然，零号机仿佛从虚空中冲出，直逼眼前。长矛在他们之间缓缓旋转。雷亚娜操控着机体靠近，直至与零号机的核心近在咫尺。

"Hello, Dr. Ikari. This is your stop." Rayana reached out and laid her hand on Unit-01's exposed red Core and closed her eyes. "Shinji, please place your hand on her like I have. It will help me with the extraction." Shinji reached his hand out. The surface of the red crystal was ice cold and faintly gritty under his touch. He tried to concentrate and reach out like he had when he would start up the synch process. He could feel...something. A stirring, something like the feeling from his memories of piloting.
"你好，碇博士，到站了。"雷亚娜伸出手，放在零号机暴露的红色核心上，闭上了眼睛。"真嗣，请像我这样把手放在她的核心上，这有助于我进行提取。"真嗣伸出手，红色晶体的表面冰冷而略带粗糙。他试图集中精神，像启动同步过程时那样去感受。他能感觉到...某种东西，像是驾驶时的记忆中那种涌动的感觉。

"Ahh, there you are, Dr. Ikari. Now, just take my hand, and..." Rayana threw them both backward off Unit-01's chest. As they shot backwards, Shinji felt someone take his hand and grip hard. Out of Unit-01's Core came a tall, slender, brown-haired woman with a strong resemblance to Rei Ayanami. Shinji's eyes widened as he recognized her from Instrumentality.
"啊，你在这儿，碇博士。现在，只需握住我的手，然后……" 雷亚娜将他们两人从零号机的胸前向后抛出。当他们向后飞去时，真嗣感觉到有人握住了他的手，紧紧抓住。从零号机的核心中走出一位高挑、苗条、棕色头发的女性，与绫波丽有着惊人的相似。真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他认出她来自人类补完计划。

"Mother?" 妈妈？

The woman's eyes locked onto Shinji. "Shinji?" Her grip on his hand pulled them into a hug. The first time he'd been in his mother's arms since he was three. He basked in the warmth of his mother's embrace, drinking in his first taste of maternal affection in over sixteen years.
女人的目光锁定在真嗣身上。"真嗣？"她紧握着他的手，将他拉入怀中。这是他自三岁以来第一次被母亲拥抱。他沉浸在母亲怀抱的温暖中，十六多年来第一次感受到母爱的滋味。

Right up until he realized his mother was still mother-naked.
直到他意识到母亲仍然一丝不挂。

Shinji jerked back, his face reddening. A mass of black fabric hit the side of his face, interrupting his imminent exclamation of alarm. "Here, you can put this on, Dr. Ikari. I think your son would appreciate it," Rayana smoothly interjected.
真嗣猛地后退，脸颊泛红。一大块黑色布料击中他的脸颊，打断了他即将发出的惊呼。“来，您可以穿上这个，碇博士。我想您儿子会喜欢的，”雷亚娜流畅地插话道。

"Oh! Thank you." Yui Ikari slipped herself into Rayana's removed outer robe. "How did you get here, Shinji? And how did you just do that? Who is this?"
哦！谢谢你。" 碇唯将自己裹进雷亚娜脱下的外袍中。"真嗣，你是怎么来到这里的？还有，你刚才做了什么？这位是谁？

"Mother, this is Rayana Hart-O'Brien. She...um... It's complicated."
妈妈，这是雷亚娜·哈特-奥布赖恩。她...呃...情况有点复杂。

"Hi!" Rayana chirped brightly. "I'm an ancient and powerful sorceress from a vast mutli-dimensional space empire who traveled across space and time to raise the dead, smite the wicked, and help your son get a date."
嗨！"雷亚娜兴高采烈地说，"我是一位来自庞大多维空间帝国的古老而强大的女巫，穿越时空来到这里，为了复活死者，惩罚恶人，并帮助你儿子找到约会对象。

Yui Ikari stared at her.
绫波丽凝视着她。

"Have I mentioned I'm part space-alien?" Rayana added cheerily.
"我有没有提过我是半个外星人？" 蕾安娜愉快地补充道。

"Uh... huh?" Shinji contributed.
"嗯……啊？" 真嗣插话道。

"Ok, just kidding on that last part. That would be silly. I'm part dragon-demon, naturally."
好吧，刚才那部分是开玩笑的。那太傻了。我自然是有龙魔血统的。

Yui looked back at Shinji. "Son, what...tell me what's going on, please?"
绫看着真嗣，回头问道：“儿子，到底……告诉我发生了什么，好吗？”

"Um, except for that last part, which I hadn't heard yet, she's telling the truth. Wait, what was that part about getting me a date?"
嗯，除了最后那部分我没听到，她说的都是真的。等等，那部分关于给我安排约会的又是怎么回事？

Rayana snapped her fingers, and space was empty again.
拉亚娜打了个响指，空间再次变得空无一物。

In a damp subbasement, five men raised sub-machineguns at a struggling, pleading woman handcuffed to a ring hanging from the low ceiling. The crying woman kept begging to see her daughter as the firing squad sighted in on her chest.
在潮湿的地下室里，五名男子举起冲锋枪对准一个挣扎着、哀求着的被手铐铐在低矮天花板上吊环的女人。哭泣的女人不断恳求见她的女儿，而行刑队则瞄准了她的胸膛。

The officer of the detail raised his hand. "Ready. Aim. Fire!"
队列的军官举起手。"准备。瞄准。开火！"

"NO!" Asuka leapt at the nearest gunman.
"不！" 明日香扑向最近的枪手。

Five guns barked. The muzzle flares lit the room like daylight.
五支枪齐声轰鸣。枪口焰照亮了房间，宛如白昼。

"Time Out!" Daniel said sharply.
"暂停！"丹尼尔厉声说道。

Asuka checked her headlong lunge for the closest man as the flame of the muzzle flare from his weapon hung in the stilled air like a blossom made of fire. The copper gleam of the bullet shone in the light at the tip of the flare.
明日香检查了自己冲向最近那人的猛烈一击，枪口火焰的余晖如同火焰之花悬挂在静止的空气中。子弹尖端在火光中闪烁着铜色的光芒。

Asuka whirled. "Are you trying to give me a heart attack?! Why the Hell did you cut it so close? Couldn't we have showed up five minutes ago?"
明日香猛地转身。“你想吓死我吗？！为什么非要这么近才出现？我们不能早五分钟到吗？”

"Sorry, Asuka. I didn't mean to worry you. But relax. I can raise the dead and control space and time. A bullet is hardly a threat to you anymore. Nothing is going to hurt you or your mother. I brought us in this close to avoid anyone else interfering with the puzzler I'm going to give them." He stepped next to where Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu stood chained. He repeated the wave along her body that he'd used in Winthrop's bedroom, and a copy of Kyoko stood next to them, right down to the handcuffs on her wrists. He snapped her cuffs with his fingertips, and swapped their positions. He pressed a hand to her forehead, and she unfroze, but went limp and unconscious. He looked back to Asuka. "Get that guy's pistol out of his holster, please."
对不起，明日香。我不是故意让你担心的。但放心吧，我能复活死者，操控时空。子弹对你来说已不再是威胁。你和你母亲都不会受到任何伤害。我带我们到这里来，是为了避免其他人干扰我将要给他们的谜题。" 他走到被锁链束缚的绢野琴子身边，重复了在温索普卧室使用过的身体扫描，一个与绢野一模一样、连手铐都复制得丝毫不差的复制体出现在他们旁边。他用指尖轻弹，解开了复制体的手铐，并交换了她们的位置。他把手放在复制体的额头上，她解冻了，但随即瘫软昏迷。他回头看向明日香，"请把那人枪套里的手枪拿出来。

Asuka looked behind her, and yanked the stubby Makarov out of the man's holster. She handed it to Daniel. "What are you going to do with it, shoot them?"
明日香回头一看，迅速从那人枪套中抽出短小的马卡洛夫手枪，递给丹尼尔。"你要用它做什么，开枪打他们吗？"

He took it, chambered a round, and fired a half-dozen shots into the dirt at the far end of the room. Daniel then placed it in the copy's hand. "Nope. I leave that privilege of reciprocity to you."
他接过枪，上膛后向房间远端的泥土开了五六枪。随后，丹尼尔将枪放在复制体手中。“不，我留给你这个相互回报的特权。”

Asuka started. "What?" 明日香一惊：“什么？”

"I think you've got a bit more right to shoot the men who were just fine with carrying out the death sentence on your mother than I do. I'm just setting up a marginally plausible explanation for how they all end up dead for Winthrop's goons to try to figure out. They all show up dead with no other guns around to explain it, they might do something weird. This way, at least they can grasp at some sort of 'she got the officer's gun and somehow shot all six of them while they shot her' scenario. While handcuffed, no less."
我认为你比我有更多理由去射杀那些对你母亲执行死刑毫无顾忌的人。我只是为温斯洛的手下们构思一个勉强说得通的解释，让他们去揣摩这些人是怎么死的。如果他们都死了，周围又没有其他枪支来解释，他们可能会做出奇怪的推断。这样至少他们可以设想一个'她夺取了警官的枪，并在被手铐铐住的情况下，不知怎么地射杀了他们六人'的场景。

Asuka slowly drew the heavy .45 from her own holster. She looked at the frozen faces of the firing squad. Three looked bored. Two of them were grinning. 'You were going to kill my mother. Again. And you just pulled the trigger.' Asuka found what little reluctance she had for the idea evaporating. She backed up a couple of steps, raised the gun, and thumbed off the safety. The .45 bucked in her hand as she methodically fired at each man's face. She briefly halted halfway through the line when she noticed the bullets she'd fired hanging in the air just past the end of the muzzle.
明日香缓缓地从自己的枪套中拔出那把沉重的.45 手枪。她看着行刑队那些凝固的面孔，其中三人显得无聊，两人在咧嘴笑。'你们曾要再次杀害我的母亲。你们刚刚扣动了扳机。'明日香发现自己对这个想法的犹豫几乎消失了。她后退几步，举起枪，拨开保险。随着她有条不紊地瞄准每人的脸部射击，.45 手枪在她手中猛烈震动。当她注意到刚射出的子弹在枪口外不远处悬停时，她在中途停顿了一下。

"The bullets will just keep going once we're gone?"
子弹在我们离开后还会继续飞吗？

"Yup. They'll hit all at once this way. No need to worry about somebody dodging or surviving long enough to sound an alarm.
是的。它们会同时击中目标，这样就不用担心有人躲避或幸存下来发出警报了。

"Good." Asuka resumed her aim, sighting in on the next man's grin. Three more shots and gobbet of spit for the officer as an extra and her mother's interrupted third death was preemptively avenged. She holstered the pistol and turned back around. Daniel picked up her mother's limp body, and walked back to her.
"好。" 明日香重新瞄准，对准下一个男人的笑容。再开三枪，再给军官一口唾沫作为额外奉送，她母亲被中断的第三次死亡就提前得到了报复。她收起手枪，转身回去。丹尼尔抱起她母亲瘫软的身体，向她走来。

Asuka looked down at her mother's half-remembered face, seeing the unmistakable evidence of their relationship in the blurred mirror of her own features. "Mama," Asuka whispered.
明日香低头看着母亲那张半模糊的脸，从自己模糊的倒影中看到了他们关系的无可辩驳的证据。"妈妈，"明日香轻声唤道。

"Let's go somewhere a bit more hospitable to do the real work. Put your hand on your mother, please," Daniel said.
"我们找个更适宜的地方去做真正的工作吧。请把手放在你母亲身上，"丹尼尔说。

Asuka reached out and gently took her mother's hand.
明日香伸出手，轻轻握住了她母亲的手。

They vanished. An unmeasureable instant later, six men died, leaving the world no poorer for their loss.
他们消失了。转瞬之间，六人丧生，世界并未因他们的离去而显得更加贫瘠。

Daniel and Asuka reappeared in the tent by the shore. Daniel laid Asuka's mother out on the air in front of him at waist height like there was an unseen hospital bed. He took the pulsing diamond out of his belt pouch and reversed the change of forms in his closed hands. He handed it to Asuka. "Hold this carefully for me, if you please."
丹尼尔和明日香在湖边的帐篷里重新出现。丹尼尔将明日香的母亲平放在面前，仿佛有一张看不见的病床支撑着她。他从腰间的袋子里取出那颗跳动的钻石，双手紧握，逆转了形态变化。他将钻石递给明日香，说道：“请小心帮我拿着这个。”

Asuka gingerly took it in her cupped hands. Its warmth and familiar feeling brought a small smile to her lips. She didn't notice the tears running down her face until Daniel's voice snapped her attention back up.
明日香小心翼翼地用双手捧起它。它的温暖和熟悉的感觉让她的嘴角露出一丝微笑。直到丹尼尔的声音将她的注意力拉回，她才意识到自己脸上流淌的泪水。

"Asuka...Asuka?" 明日香...明日香？

"Uh! I..." Asuka blinked away the blurring in her eyes. "I'm...I'm sorry. I can't believe this is happening...Mama..."
啊！我……" 明日香眨眼驱散眼前的模糊。"我……我很抱歉。真不敢相信这正在发生……妈妈……

"It's alright, child. I can feel it coming off you. I... that joy is why I do this," he said gently. "Put that piece of her soul on her chest in a moment when I tell you to." He spread his hands above Kyoko's body like he was dropping an invisible sheet over her. Soft gold light began to pour out from his hands and spill over her, waving and roiling like liquid. Once it had completely covered her mother, Daniel continued, "Now, put it right over her heart and press it down slowly."
没关系，孩子。我能感受到你的情绪。我……那份喜悦是我做这件事的原因，" 他温和地说道。"等我指示时，把那片她的灵魂放在她的胸口上。" 他双手在恭子身体上方展开，仿佛在铺一张无形的床单。柔和的金色光芒开始从他的手中倾泻而出，覆盖在她身上，像液体一样波动翻滚。当光芒完全包裹住她的母亲后，丹尼尔继续说："现在，把它正好放在她的心上，然后慢慢按下。

Asuka carefully raised the orb and centered it over her mother's chest. She lowered it until it touched her skin, then slowly pressed it down against a strange, fluid resistance. It passed through into her body and vanished. "Now what?" she asked.
明日香小心翼翼地举起球体，将其置于母亲胸前正中。她缓缓下压，直至触及皮肤，随后慢慢施力，克服一种奇异的流动阻力。球体穿透皮肤，没入体内，消失不见。“接下来怎么办？”她问道。

"I very carefully meld them back into one. This is something I've haven't done in a while, and it isn't quick. This will take me some time. Most of my mind is going to be deep within during this. Don't let anyone overly disturb us," Daniel said distractedly. "It may help if you just talk to me a bit. That will keep me from getting too deep within and lose track of where I am.
“我会非常小心地将它们融合回一体。这事儿我有一阵子没做了，而且并不迅速。这需要我花费一些时间。我的大部分心神都将沉浸其中。别让任何人过分打扰我们，”丹尼尔心不在焉地说，“如果你能和我聊聊天，或许会有所帮助。这样能让我不至于过于深入，从而迷失自我。”

"Talk to you? About what?"
跟你谈谈？谈什么？

"Anything you like, Asuka. This is a good time for any questions you might have."
你想聊什么都行，Asuka。现在是提问的好时机。

"Okay, here's my biggest one: Why are you doing this? An omnipotent god just wants to take pity on some mortals? Why are you doing all this, righting all my wrongs, turning the world upside-down for me with no demand for anything in return? Why?" Asuka asked.
"好的，这是我的最大疑问：你为什么要这么做？一个全能的神只是想怜悯一些凡人吗？你为什么要做这一切，纠正我所有的错误，为了我而颠覆世界，却没有任何回报的要求？为什么？" 明日香问道。

Daniel's face had a wry, weary sadness to it. "We get that question a lot. People are always asking Imperial Rangers, Soldiers, Marines... seeing all the things that we do, jumping into other peoples wars and struggles with no possible gain for us... they see us helping the innocent, the weak, and the downtrodden, and they always ask us, 'Why are you doing this?' We always reply, sometimes with confusion, sometimes sadness, 'Why aren't you?' I'm doing this because it's just. Because I can. And because I can, to not do so is to actively decide against doing something good. I'm not that person. I can't not do this."
丹尼尔的脸上带着一种苦涩而疲惫的悲伤。"我们经常被问到这个问题。人们总是问帝国游侠、士兵、海军陆战队员……看到我们所做的一切，跳入他人的战争和斗争中，对我们没有任何可能的利益……他们看到我们帮助无辜者、弱者和受压迫者，他们总是问我们，'你为什么要这么做？' 我们总是回答，有时带着困惑，有时带着悲伤，'为什么你不这么做呢？' 我这么做是因为这是正义的。因为我能做到。而且，因为能做到，不去这么做就是主动选择不做善事。我不是那种人。我不能不这么做。"

"But why me? There are hundreds of thousands with sad stories like mine on my world alone. And from what you've told me, there are an infinity of worlds out there just as bad or more."
但为什么是我？在我所在的这个世界，有成千上万像我这样有着悲伤故事的人。而根据你告诉我的，外面还有无数的世界，情况同样糟糕，甚至更糟。

"Welcome to my world," he said very softly.
"欢迎来到我的世界，" 他非常轻柔地说。

Asuka stared at him across the shifting golden blanket of light that played across her mother's floating form. '"Welcome to my world."' He hadn't said that even when it was literally true, the night before. No, he'd waved grandly at the blazing night sky, the three Niven rings of the system making immense arcs across the vault of the heavens. '"Welcome to Avalon!"' he'd said, the picture of cheer. This was far more naked than just introducing her to his home. She kept her face a mask, a habit that had kept her alive these last few years, but suppressed a shiver. 'Does he really mean that the way it sounded?'
明日香凝视着他，透过那层在母亲漂浮身影上舞动的金色光毯。“欢迎来到我的世界。”他昨晚那夜，即便这话字面意义成真时，也未曾说过。不，他只是豪迈地挥手向着炽热的夜空，系统中的三道尼文环在天穹上划出巨大的弧线。“欢迎来到阿瓦隆！”他欢快地说道，神情愉悦。这比单纯带她认识他的家要赤裸得多。她保持着面无表情，这是过去几年让她得以生存的习惯，但内心却抑制不住一阵颤栗。“他真的像听起来那样意味深长吗？”

His hands were steady over her mother, the golden light still softly pouring out from them over her. "The old saying, 'Against stupidity, the gods themselves strive in vain.'" He sighed, "No, it's not stupidity for me, its infinity. It's like trying to push a river back to its source one quark at a time. And every time you move one, two more appear. But you can't stop. I can't stop. I didn't go through all the trouble of apotheosis because I wanted to be glorified. I did it because I needed the power to fight at a level higher than I could do as 'merely' immortal and powerful. I could be in a thousand places at once, create my own universe to be a base for those that followed me, be at hand for every crisis… 'No Sparrow Shall Fall, That We Do Not Save It' was the battle cry. A mad god's dream, to stand against infinity… Until The Day We All Rise Up..."
他的双手在她母亲上方稳稳地移动，金色的光芒依旧柔和地从他手中倾泻而出，洒落在她身上。“有句老话说，‘面对愚蠢，诸神也徒劳无功。’”他叹息道，“不，对我来说，这不是愚蠢，而是无限。就像试图一点一滴地将河流推回源头。每次你移动一个夸克，就会出现两个新的。但你不能停下。我也不能停下。我历经千辛万苦达到神化，并非为了追求荣耀。我这么做是因为我需要拥有超越‘仅仅是’不朽和强大的力量，去战斗在更高的层次。我可以同时出现在一千个地方，创造自己的宇宙作为追随者的基地，随时应对各种危机……‘没有一只麻雀会坠落，如果我们不去拯救它’是我们的战斗口号。一个疯狂之神的梦想，去对抗无限……直到我们所有人崛起的那一天……”

He broke off, and looked Asuka in the eye for the first time since he'd started. "Humph. I'm supposed to be helping you relax from your sixteen-year defensive clench of the soul, maybe talking you into giving Shinji-kun an honest chance at connecting to the real you, not letting you hear me whine about how my little crusade is so hard. I do things like this as much as I can to remind me why I do this. To remind me how to be human. But this is what happens when I spend too long compressed into a mortal body. The futility gets to me a bit more."
他突然停下，自开始以来第一次直视明日香的眼睛。“哼，我本该帮你从十六年来的灵魂防御紧握中放松下来，或许说服你给真嗣一个真诚接触真实自我的机会，而不是让你听我抱怨我的小小奋斗有多艰难。我尽可能做这些事，是为了提醒我为何这么做，提醒我如何成为人。但当我长时间被压缩在凡人之躯时，就会发生这种情况。那种徒劳感对我影响更大了。”

Asuka's wide-eyed stare at him finally blinked. "Mein Gott… y-you… I've watched you stop time like it had a pause button, travel through time like you're walking from room to room, teleport us around the world in a blink with no more apparent effort than talking, control Winthrop's mind so much he didn't even notice we were standing within arm's reach of him while he fucked a dummy of me you'd just created out of thin air and replaced for my past self so that he never raped me, retrieve my mother's damaged soul from her…her hanging body…" She shook her head slowly. "And now you complain that you can't fix every injustice in reality? And I thought the Third Child acted like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders!"
明日香睁大眼睛盯着他，终于眨了眨眼。“我的天哪……你……我见过你像按暂停键一样停止时间，像从一个房间走到另一个房间一样穿越时间，毫不费力地一眨眼就把我们传送到世界各地，控制温思罗普的思想，以至于他甚至没有注意到我们站在他伸手可及的地方，而他却在操一个你刚刚凭空创造出来并替换了我过去自我的我的假人，这样他就永远不会强奸我了，从她……她悬挂的尸体中找回我母亲的受损灵魂……”她缓缓摇头。“而现在你却抱怨你不能修复现实中的每一个不公？我还以为第三适格者表现得好像肩负着世界的重担呢！”

"Just one world? Wimp. I've got trillions. And a constant bodyguard of a few score billion ghosts from my past errors. That's why I said I'd never mock your pain, Asuka. I know it too well. I know everyone's too well. You live as long as I have, you get to make all sorts of interesting mistakes." He sighed. "Sometimes mistakes that get up and run off all by themselves."
“只有一个世界？懦夫。我有数万亿个。还有一群数十亿来自我过去错误的鬼魂作为我的常备保镖。这就是为什么我说我永远不会嘲笑你的痛苦，明日香。我太了解了。我太了解每个人的痛苦了。你像我一样活了这么久，你会犯下各种各样有趣的错误。”他叹了口气。“有时候，这些错误会自己站起来跑掉。”

"What?" "什么？"

"I made a big mistake, once upon a time, before founding the Empire, that had far reaching consequences. Nietzsche was right about the 'he who fights with monsters' thing. I fought monsters alone so long I couldn't even see what I was turning into. Friends pulled me back from a final descent into chaos, but coming back from that had... costs. My darkness is still out there, doing damage all its own. I am still fighting the repercussions of that to this day."
我曾犯下一个大错，那是在建立帝国之前，其后果深远。尼采关于'与怪物战斗'的说法是正确的。我独自与怪物战斗太久，以至于看不清自己变成了什么。朋友们将我从彻底陷入混乱的边缘拉了回来，但从中恢复过来……是有代价的。我的黑暗仍在那里，造成它自己的伤害。至今我仍在与那后果抗争。

"Now I know why you had Lieutenant Leibshott talking to me instead of yourself."
现在我知道为什么是你让莱布施托特中尉来跟我谈话，而不是你自己了。

"Hey, I'm usually much more fun. I'm a lot less powerful than full creator-god level away from Avalon itself, so it's taking a lot of me to do this here. Ninety-five percent of my mind is busy working on your mother's soul, so you're really only getting about twentieth of me. I've spent way too long compressed to mortality this time, and haven't taken a real break to see friends or just get lost for a while in about two thousand years. I'm due." He laughed. "Heh, come to think of it, part of why I was in your 'vicinity' to pick up on your 'story' was that my last vacation brought me into an 'Evangelion' based universe. Very far from your own and the baseline one we use as a marker, but it still had NERV, Angels, and recognizable analogs for yourself and most of the crew. I had some fun there, gave them a hand, helped a few scared kids find their undounamatas, and even tried my hand at a test plug, just for curiosity's sake. Dr. Akagi's curiosity, not mine. I knew what my results would be."
嘿，我通常可有趣多了。我离阿瓦隆本身的全能造物主级别还差得远，所以在这里做这些事消耗了我很多力量。我百分之九十五的心思都忙于你母亲灵魂的工作，所以你实际上只得到了我大约二十分之一的部分。这次我压缩到凡人的状态太久了，已经有大约两千年没有真正休息过，去见见朋友，或者只是漫无目的地迷失一段时间。我该休息了。"他笑道，"呵，想想看，我之所以能出现在你附近，接触到你的故事，部分原因是我上一次休假带我进入了一个以《新世纪福音战士》为背景的宇宙。离你所在的和我们用作基准的那个宇宙非常远，但那里仍有 NERV、使徒，以及对你和大部分船员的可识别的类似角色。我在那里玩得很开心，帮了他们一把，帮助几个害怕的孩子找到了他们的命运，甚至还出于好奇尝试了一次插入栓测试。那是赤木博士的好奇心，不是我的。我知道我的测试结果会是什么。"

"How? It took months of tries and training before I could synch well enough with Unit-02 to be effective in combat, and that was my mother's soul. I thought it was supposed to be almost impossible to synch just out of the blue like that?" Asuka said quizzically.
"怎么可能？我花了好几个月的时间尝试和训练，才终于能与二号机同步，在战斗中发挥作用，那还是因为我母亲的灵魂。我以为这种突然之间就能同步的情况几乎是不可能的？" 明日香疑惑地说道。

"While you were out of it after the 15th Angel's attack, Shinji had that encounter with Kaworu, so you missed it. When they put him in a test plug loaded with the profile for Unit-02, he had a perfectly high synch ratio. That was due to him being an Angel. He could manipulate his own AT-field enough to match Unit-02 to whatever level he wanted. The ability to modify the 'light of his soul' made that easy. Once I knew that soul mechanics was what the Evangelion Series was based on, it was pretty easy for me too." He nodded at Asuka's mother as the gold light-blanket continued to flow out from his hands over her prone form. "Like I'm doing here. The ability to create, modify, and if need be destroy souls is part of the package of godhood. So once I got in the test plug I could set my own synch ratio with little effort."
在你被第十五使徒攻击后昏迷期间，真嗣遇到了薰，所以你错过了那一段。当他们让他进入装载了二号机配置文件的测试插入栓时，他的同步率出奇地高。这是因为他是使徒。他能够操纵自己的 AT 力场，使二号机与他想要的任何同步水平相匹配。他能够改变自己灵魂之光，这使得一切变得容易。一旦我知道了 EVA 系列是基于灵魂机制的，对我来说也就很简单了。" 他向明日香的母亲点头示意，同时金色的光芒继续从他的手中流出，覆盖在她躺着的身体上。"就像我现在做的这样。创造、修改，必要时甚至摧毁灵魂的能力，都是神性的组成部分。所以一旦我进入测试插入栓，我就能轻松地设定自己的同步率。

"So Dr. Akagi loads me up with the profile for Unit-00, and the first result she gets for my synch ratio is '2.718%'."
于是，赤木博士给我加载了零号机的资料，她得到我的同步率第一个结果是'2.718%'。

Asuka raised her eyebrow. "2.718% synch doesn't sound like much worth talking about. Wait...the natural logarithm root?"
明日香挑起眉毛说：“2.718%的同步率听起来没什么好谈的。等等……自然对数的底数？”

"Bingo, Fr?ulein Math Major!" He grinned. "Then, after thirty seconds, my synch ratio shifted to 'i'."
宾果，数学专业的女士！"他咧嘴笑道，"然后，三十秒后，我的同步率变成了'i'。

"The square root of -1? What was that supposed to mean for synching with an Eva? That's not even on the scale! It goes from zero to a theoretical 400%."
负一的平方根？这对与 Eva 同步意味着什么？那甚至不在量表上！它从零到理论上的 400%。

"Thirty seconds later, back to '2.718%'. Thirty seconds later, back to 'i'. Then it went to zero." He started laughing. "About a minute later, Dr. Akagi started throwing things at me because she figured out I was screwing with her. It didn't help that I started whistling."
三十秒后，又回到了'2.718%'。再过三十秒，又回到了'i'。然后它归零了。"他开始笑起来。"大约一分钟后，赤木博士开始朝我扔东西，因为她意识到我在捉弄她。更糟糕的是，我开始吹口哨。

"What are you-...wait, e-i-e-i-0?" Asuka eyes opened wide. "Seriously? That's...that's..." She couldn't help it. She started laughing out loud. The first time she'd honestly done so in as long as she could remember, years. She wiped at her eyes to clear the tears of laughter.
"你这是在...等等，e-i-e-i-0？"明日香睁大了眼睛。"真的吗？这...这..."她忍不住了，开始放声大笑。这是她多年来第一次如此真诚地笑出声来。她擦了擦眼角的笑泪。

Daniel wore a huge grin. "Yup. I told Dr. Akagi it wouldn't work the way she thought it would. I warned her that even if I just sat there, the results wouldn't make any sense, since my soul is not at all like a baseline human's anymore. She didn't want to listen. Even with all that, I don't think she really caught on that I was completely making up the results until I made the reading come out as '++Divide By Cheese Error++, ++Please Delete And Reinstall Universe++'. Boy, did she lose it then. Even Major Katsuragi snorted coffee out her nose at that one. It was so worth it."
丹尼尔脸上挂着大大的笑容。“没错。我告诉赤木博士，她的想法行不通。我警告过她，即使我坐在那里什么都不做，结果也会毫无意义，因为我的灵魂已经完全不同于普通人类了。她就是不听。即便如此，我想她直到我让读数显示为‘++除以奶酪错误++，++请删除并重新安装宇宙++’时，才真正意识到我完全是在捏造结果。那时她可真是气坏了。连葛城少校都笑得把咖啡从鼻子里喷了出来。真是太值了。”

Asuka cracked up, falling to her knees and howling with laughter.
明日香笑得前仰后合，跪在地上放声大笑。

### Chapter 06.2 Sins Of The Father

Shinji and his party appeared in space once more. This time Earth hung off in the distance in front of Shinji, and twisting his head around he could just make out the bone-white shine of Luna over Unit-01's shoulder.
真嗣和他的同伴再次出现在太空中。这一次，地球在真嗣面前遥遥悬挂，他扭头望去，透过初号机的肩膀，隐约可见月亮的苍白光芒。

"Shinji, I'm going to leave Eva Unit-01 here at the L4 point until we decide what to do with it. This is also a nice quiet spot for us to have a talk about you, your parents, and the things they were up to that led up to the Third Impact," Rayana said briskly. She snapped again, and a round table and chairs appeared between them. Shinji found gravity returning enough to allow him to sit down.
"真嗣，我打算将 Eva 初号机暂时留在 L4 点，直到我们决定如何处理它。这里也是个安静的好地方，我们可以谈谈你、你的父母，以及导致第三次冲击的那些事情。" 雷亚娜干脆地说道。她再次打了个响指，一张圆桌和椅子出现在他们之间。真嗣感觉到重力恢复到足以让他坐下的程度。

Rayana turned to Yui. "And I'm sure you'll want to hear some of what your husband got up to in the time you were stuck inside Eva Unit-01. What do you remember of that time, Dr. Ikari?"
绫波转向唯说：“我相信你一定想听听你丈夫在你被困在 Eva 初号机期间所做的事情。你对那段时间还记得些什么，碇博士？”

"A lot of it is rather fuzzy. Unless Eva Unit-01 was powered up, my awareness was rather restricted to what was right in front of me, and that only in a very limited way. But please, tell me who you are and what is going on? We're floating in space and sitting at a table like we're about to have a tea ceremony!" Yui exclaimed.
“很多记忆都相当模糊。除非 Eva 初号机启动，否则我的意识只能局限于眼前的事物，而且非常有限。但请告诉我，你是谁，这里发生了什么？我们漂浮在太空中，坐在桌前，仿佛即将举行一场茶道仪式！”唯惊呼道。

"I am Dame Rayana Kylise Hart-O'Brien, Knight Commander of the Centre for Covert Multi-Dimensional Operations, Avalon Imperial University Mistress of Musical Arcanum, Imperial Sorceress Supreme, Duchess of Narya, Lady of Mothers' Fury, Her Most Mystic Majesty, Witch Queen of Avalon. Please call me Rayana. Would you like something to drink?" She reeled off her titles again with a smile.
"我是雷亚娜·凯莉丝·哈特-奥布莱恩女爵，隐秘多维行动中心骑士指挥官，阿瓦隆帝国大学音乐奥秘女主人，帝国至尊女巫，纳里亚公爵夫人，母之怒女士，至高神秘女王，阿瓦隆巫后。请叫我雷亚娜。您想喝点什么吗？" 她带着微笑再次报出自己的头衔。

Yui Ikari blinked at her several times. Then she rubbed her forehead. "Yes, coffee, please," she said. "Now, what does that mean?"
绫波丽眨了几次眼，然后揉了揉额头。"好的，请给我咖啡，" 她说，"那么，那是什么意思呢？"

Rayana snapped softly at the table, and a steaming carafe of coffee and trimmings appeared. "Good recovery time, Dr. Ikari. You were reported to be a smart lady. To summarize, the tale of your son's experiences in the Angel War and the Third Impact came to my husband the Emperor's attention, and was of interest enough to him that he spent the effort to find the universe where it had happened. He considered the end result," she waved at the towering bulk of Unit-01 behind them and at the red ring of souls around Earth in front of them, "to be unfairly tragic and dark in view of the suffering they endured. He makes rather a living of righting wrongs and seeing justice done. So he came here, to offer his help to your son and his companion in rectifying some of the harsher legacies of the Angel War and the Third Impact."
蕾雅娜轻声敲了敲桌子，一壶热气腾腾的咖啡和配套用具便出现了。"恢复得真快，碇博士。据报道，您是个聪明的女士。简而言之，您儿子在天使战争和第三次冲击中的经历引起了我的丈夫——皇帝的注意，他对这些故事产生了足够的兴趣，以至于他费尽心思找到了这个宇宙。他认为最终结果，"她挥手指向身后高耸的初号机和眼前环绕地球的红色灵魂之环，"鉴于他们所承受的苦难，显得过于悲惨和黑暗。他一生致力于纠正错误，伸张正义。因此，他来到这里，向您的儿子及其同伴提供帮助，以纠正天使战争和第三次冲击留下的某些更为严酷的遗产。"

Yui served herself a cup of coffee and took a slow sip. The first thing she'd tasted in sixteen years. "Well, as I didn't dream in Eva Unit-01, I'm going to operate on the assumption that this is all real. And if you can pull me out of Unit-01 in deep space, then the next moment have us drinking coffee at Earth's L4 point, I'd say I have to accept the rest of what you're saying too."
绫波给自己倒了一杯咖啡，缓缓地啜了一口。这是她十六年来尝到的第一样东西。“既然我在 Eva 初号机里没有做梦，那我就姑且认为这一切都是真实的。如果你们能从深空中的初号机里把我拉出来，下一刻又让我们在地球 L4 点喝咖啡，那我也就不得不接受你们所说的其他事情了。”

Rayana rolled her eyes. "Good, that will save time. You probably wouldn't be surprised at how many people have much more trouble accepting such rather obvious events. It gets rather silly sometimes. It's not like people claim they're the Witch Queen of Avalon every day, do they? Anyhow, I think it's time that Shinji learn about a few key things, like what SEELE was really up to, the changes you, Professor Fuyutsuki, and Gendo made in your counter-plans, and what resulted from all that." Her voice was rather cold when she finished.
雷亚娜翻了个白眼。“很好，这样能节省时间。你可能不会惊讶于有多少人更难以接受这些相当明显的事件。有时候真是挺可笑的。又不是每天都有人声称自己是阿瓦隆的巫后，对吧？不管怎样，我想是时候让真嗣了解一些关键的事情了，比如 SEELE 真正的目的，你、冬月教授和源堂在你们的反计划中做出的改变，以及这一切的结果。”她最后的话语带着几分寒意。

Yui seemed unruffled by the unwelcoming tone. She met Rayana's cool look squarely. "SEELE's plan would have wiped out humanity and tried to make themselves into gods. We did what we had to in order to disrupt this plan."
面对不友好的语气，结似乎不为所动。她直视着蕾安娜冷淡的目光，坚定地说：“SEELE 的计划本欲灭绝人类，并试图将自己塑造成神。我们为了破坏这一计划，不得不采取行动。”

"Hence my questions as to how much you can remember, as I believe that whatever plan you may have come up with, it began to go rather awry once Gendo was forced to deal with the actuality of losing you. He seems to have gone rather mad." Rayana's tone was a shade less chill, but still not very kind.
因此我才问你能记得多少，因为我相信，无论你构思了什么计划，一旦源堂被迫面对失去你的现实，计划就开始出现偏差，他似乎已经变得相当疯狂。蕾安娜的语气略微缓和，但依旧不甚友好。

"Mad?" 疯了吗？

"After you essentially died, and all his efforts to extract your soul from Eva Unit-01 failed, he convinced Dr. Fuyutsuki to cooperate with him on a plan he called the Scenario. Beginning with abandoning Shinji on the doorstep of a tutor, he had next to no contact with your son for the next ten years. He very quickly began sleeping with Naoko Akagi, apparently entirely as a way of controlling her to work on his project to create a clone of you mixed with Angel DNA. The first product of which then informed Dr. Akagi the elder of Gendo's manipulations to the point she flew into a homicidal rage and strangled the child, then threw herself off the top of the NERV command deck to her death. So Gendo then began sleeping with her daughter, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, to ensure the massive cloning project continued. He went out of his way to be actively neglectful of Shinji, to the point of abuse. He forced Shinji to nearly kill one of his friends, and then locked Eva Unit-01 down in the Geofront hangar rather than let Shinji take you out and try to protect a girl who actually meant something to him who was being mind-raped. Was that part of your plan?"
在你几乎死去之后，尽管他竭尽全力试图从 Eva Unit-01 中提取你的灵魂，但都以失败告终，他便说服了福音博士与他合作，共同实施他所谓的'剧本'计划。他首先将真嗣遗弃在一位家庭教师的门前，随后十年间几乎与儿子断绝了所有联系。他很快便与直子·赤木开始同居，显然完全是为了控制她，让她参与他的项目——将你与天使 DNA 混合克隆。第一个克隆体向赤木博士透露了源渡的操纵行为，导致她陷入狂怒并勒死了孩子，随后从 NERV 指挥塔顶跳下自尽。于是源渡转而与她的女儿，律子·赤木博士同居，以确保庞大的克隆计划继续进行。他刻意忽视真嗣，甚至到了虐待的地步。他迫使真嗣差点杀死自己的朋友，然后将 Eva Unit-01 锁在 Geofront 机库中，不让真嗣带你出去保护一个对他真正有意义的女孩，而那个女孩正遭受精神上的侵犯。这是你计划的一部分吗？

Shinji's face darkened as Rayana listed some of his father's 'greatest hits'. Nothing else in his entire life had cut as deep as his father's treatment of him as some sort of unfortunate mistake in his past, only of value to him as long as he was useful to him. His mother's eyes had widened as Rayana listed his sins, but her face betrayed nothing else. She did shift her eyes to Shinji as Rayana finished. "Is that true, Shinji?" she asked quietly.
当雷亚娜列举出他父亲的一些“杰作”时，真嗣的脸色阴沉了下来。他一生中没有任何事情比他父亲将他视为过去的一个不幸错误更伤他的心，只有在他有用时才对他有所价值。他母亲的眼睛随着雷亚娜列举的罪行而睁大，但她的脸上没有流露出其他情绪。雷亚娜说完后，她将目光转向真嗣，轻声问道：“真嗣，这是真的吗？”

Shinji could only nod, his eyes in his lap.
真嗣只能点头，目光落在自己的膝上。

Rayana's mouth twisted like she'd bitten something sour. She snapped at the air to her left, and a glass and pitcher appeared. The pitcher poured her a glass of dark amber tea, and she took a sip before continuing. "I am the Lady of Mothers' Fury. I do not like those who hurt children. So I am not very happy with Commander Ikari. But We are fair. My husband would like to offer some mitigating information. It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so I'll let him do it. Ahem."
蕾雅娜的嘴角扭曲，仿佛尝到了什么酸涩之物。她朝左边猛地一咬，一只玻璃杯和一只水壶凭空出现。水壶为她倒了一杯深琥珀色的茶，她抿了一口后继续说道：“我是母怒之主。我不喜欢那些伤害孩子的人。所以我对伊卡里指挥官并不满意。但我们公正无私。我的丈夫希望提供一些减轻罪责的信息。这仍让我感到不快，因此我将发言权交给他。咳咳。”

Her voice dropped a couple octaves and her body language shifted. "Good to meet you, Dr. Ikari. I am Daniel, Rayana's other half. I'm away right now, helping… a friend of Shinji's with a different family problem. But let me offer something in Commander Ikari's defense." Rayana's head turned to Shinji. "Shinji, while you were in the hangar and Asuka was fighting for her life on the surface, your father was deep within the Geofront, down in Terminal Dogma with Rei III, the third copy of Ayanami-san. He was there to trigger the Third Impact himself."
她的声音降低了几个八度，身体语言也随之改变。“很高兴见到你，碇博士。我是丹尼尔，蕾雅娜的另一半。我现在正忙于帮助……真嗣的一位朋友处理另一个家庭问题。但请允许我为伊卡里指挥官辩护几句。”蕾雅娜的目光转向了真嗣。“真嗣，当你在机库，而明日香在地表为生存而战时，你的父亲正深入到 Geofront 的终端教条，与第三代绫波在一起。他去那里是为了亲自引发第三次冲击。”

"…no…" Yui whispered. "…不…" 结城小声说道。

"He shot Dr. Akagi when she tried to stop him. He tried to begin the ritual that would unite all of humanity in Instrumentality. Rei III refused him. She initiated Instrumentality, but decided that Gendo was not worthy of that power. She gave it to you instead, Shinji. Because you had showed her empathy, because you had reached out to her and treated her like a person rather than a tool." Rayana'a body sighed. "But as he watched ten years of desperate, detailed, at-all-costs planning crumble and what he thought was the last hope he had of seeing Yui again disappear…do you know what his last words were? 'Shinji, forgive me.'"
他在赤木博士试图阻止他时开枪了。他试图开始那个将全人类统一于‘人类补完计划’的仪式。第三代绫波拒绝了他。她启动了‘人类补完计划’，但认为源渡不配拥有那种力量。她将它转交给了你，真嗣。因为你曾向她展示过同情，因为你曾伸出援手，将她当作一个人而非工具来对待。" 蕾亚娜的身体叹了口气。"但当他目睹十年间绝望、详尽、不惜一切代价的计划土崩瓦解，以及他认为再见结城一面的最后希望消失时……你知道他最后的话是什么吗？'真嗣，原谅我。'

Shinji slowly raised his head. "What?"
真嗣缓缓抬起头。“什么？”

"To be blunt, your father was a monster, and he knew it. He initially approached your mother because she was the daughter of a member of SEELE, and he wanted to get closer to them. But along the way he actually fell in love with her. All his plans and intentions from before that went out the window. Your mother became his whole world. When she was absorbed into Eva Unit-01, he pretty much lost his mind. Everything he did for the next ten years was shaped around one goal; reuniting with her. And he would not allow concern for anything to stand in the way of that goal. Not even you. He knew he was a monster, and would do horrible things in the name of that goal. He believed that if he kept you near him, he would do only harm to you. So he sent you as far from him as he could, and kept out of all contact with you until he had no choice but to bring you back in to keep his plan going. He didn't mean to be cruel by sending you away. He knew he was a bad man, and was actually trying to protect you. He was trying to be a good person. He was just really, really bad at it."
坦白说，你父亲是个怪物，他自己也清楚这一点。他最初接近你母亲是因为她是 SEELE 成员的女儿，他想借此接近他们。但中途他真的爱上了她。之前所有的计划和意图都烟消云散。你母亲成了他的整个世界。当她被吸入 Eva 初号机时，他几乎失去了理智。接下来的十年里，他所做的一切都是围绕着一个目标：与她重聚。他不允许任何事情阻碍这个目标，甚至包括你。他知道自己是个怪物，会为了这个目标做出可怕的事情。他认为如果让你留在他身边，只会对你造成伤害。所以他把你送得离他尽可能远，并切断了所有与你联系，直到他别无选择，只能把你带回来继续他的计划。他送你离开并不是有意要残忍。他知道自己是个坏人，实际上是想保护你。他试图成为一个好人。只是他真的，真的很不擅长。

Shinji felt a sick feeling growing in the pit of his stomach as he listened. He knew his father was a monster. He'd known it every day since his father left him with a tutor and walked away from him. He'd known it every day as a Pilot. Being told his father had not intended to hurt him did not erase sixteen years of bitter anger and pain. 'Forgive him? Why? Father, why couldn't you see what you were doing?'
真嗣感到一种恶心的感觉在胃里蔓延，他听着这一切。他知道他的父亲是个怪物。自从父亲把他留给一个家庭教师并离他而去的那天起，他每天都知道这一点。作为驾驶员，他每天都知道这一点。被告知父亲并非有意伤害他，并不能抹去十六年来苦涩的愤怒和痛苦。'原谅他？为什么？父亲，为什么你看不到自己在做什么？'

"We thought you both should know that. Done on your end with her, love? Ah, good. See you again later, Dr. Ikari, Shinji." Rayana's voice shifted back up to a contralto. "Ah, that poor girl. Well, I hope my husband's words help somehow. I'm less inclined to be forgiving than he is. But even I will admit, Shinji, that does show something I bet you never thought of."
我们认为你们俩都应该知道这一点。你这边和她结束了，亲爱的？啊，好的。再见，碇博士，真嗣。" 雷亚娜的声音又变回了女低音。"啊，那个可怜的女孩。好吧，我希望我丈夫的话能有所帮助。我比他更不愿意原谅。但即使是我，也得承认，真嗣，这表明了一些我敢打赌你从未想过的事情。

"What? That my father was just as much a monster as I thought?" Shinji asked bitterly.
"什么？难道我父亲和我所想的一样，也是个怪物？" 真嗣苦涩地问道。

"That you and your father are very much alike."
你和你父亲非常相似。

Shinji's head snapped back up and his eyes burned with affronted anger. "I am not," he spat. "I am nothing like him! I would never do what he did!"
真嗣猛地抬起头，眼中燃烧着被冒犯的怒火。“我不是，”他厉声说道，“我一点也不像他！我绝不会做出他那种事！”

"It's been said before; many men grow up to become their fathers," Rayana observed. "You are more alike than you'd think. You would never do what he did, Shinji? You already have."
人们常说，许多男人长大后会变成他们的父亲，”拉亚娜评论道，“你比你想象的更像他。你永远不会做他那样的事，真嗣？你已经做过了。”

"What are you talking about?"
你在说什么呢？

"You would both…no, there's no 'would'. You both did decide something the same way; you'd burn the world before you'd go on living without the woman you love. Remember, that's what broke you, during the Third Impact; reaching the surface and seeing the shredded wreck of Unit-02 being chewed on. So when Ayanami-san asked you what you wanted to make of Instrumentality, you told her what?"
你们俩都...不，没有'会'。你们俩确实做出了同样的选择；宁愿焚毁世界，也不愿在没有心爱女人的情况下苟活。记住，这就是在第三次冲击时击垮你的原因；到达地面，看到被撕碎的零号机残骸正在被吞噬。所以当绫波问你想要如何处理人类补完计划时，你告诉了她什么？

Shinji stared endlessly past her into deep space. "'They can all just die,'" he quoted himself.
真嗣无休止地凝视着她，望向深邃的太空。“‘他们都可以去死，’”他引述自己的话。

Rayana's voice was far more gentle now. "And yet you are not him in important ways as well, Shinji. Even after all the Hell you'd gone through, you still rallied at the end, and chose to allow humanity to return to their separate existences if they had the will, and to try for happiness even against the odds.
雷亚娜的声音此刻温柔了许多。“然而，在重要方面，你也不是他，真嗣。即使经历了所有的地狱般的磨难，你最终还是振作起来，选择让人类如果愿意，可以回归各自的生活，并尽力在逆境中寻求幸福。”

"And look what it led to; the famines, scattered families, the meltdowns, the warlords, Winthrop...all of it was my fault because I said that," Shinji said hollowly, his eyes still fixed on the infinite black.
"看看这一切导致了什么；饥荒、离散的家庭、核泄漏、军阀、温思罗普……所有这些都是我的错，因为我那样说了。" 真嗣空洞地说道，目光依旧凝视着无尽的黑暗。

Yui looked out at the blue and white globe hanging in the sky. "Gendo, you fool," she said sadly. "It was all for Shinji, you should have known that. I did it for him. For the future. For all of us, so that someone would always be able to bear witness that we were here."
唯望着天空中悬挂的蓝白星球，悲伤地说："元渡，你这个傻瓜。这一切都是为了真嗣，你本该明白的。我这么做是为了他，为了未来，为了我们所有人，为了让总有人能见证我们曾存在过。"

"Dr. Ikari, it's been four years since Eva Unit-01 began drifting away from Earth, and you had only made it as far as just short of the orbit of Saturn. It would take centuries at your speed to even make it to the heliopause. While I can understand your desire to be a lasting monument to the existence of humanity, aside from your solitary consciousness, how were you doing anything that Pioneer 9 and 10 and Voyager 1 and 2 were not? Their first-contact plaques and records not sufficient proof enough that we lived? Was it worth giving up everything that you did for?"
伊卡里博士，自从 EVA 初号机开始远离地球已经四年了，而你仅仅到达了土星轨道附近。以你的速度，要到达太阳风层顶甚至需要几个世纪。尽管我能理解你想要成为人类存在的长久纪念碑的愿望，但除了你孤独的意识之外，你做的事情与先驱者 9 号、10 号以及旅行者 1 号、2 号有何不同？他们的首次接触铭牌和记录难道不足以证明我们曾经存在过吗？为了这一切，你放弃所有值得吗？

"I didn't have much choice at that point. We knew we couldn't stop SEELE. I wanted something to remain of humanity after they erased us all as individuals," Yui replied. "One of us had to do it. SEELE was on to the fact we knew of their plans and what we were doing. I had very little time left before they were going to kill me. I'm sorry I had to leave you like that, Shinji. I didn't know it would do so much to your father."
在那个时刻，我并没有太多选择。我们知道无法阻止 SEELE。我希望在它们将我们作为个体全部抹去之后，人类还能留下些什么。" 唯回答道，"总得有人去做这件事。SEELE 已经察觉到我们知道了他们的计划和我们正在做的事情。在我被他们杀害之前，我剩下的时间非常有限。真对不起，我不得不那样离开你，真嗣。我不知道这会对你的父亲造成如此大的影响。

"If it is so important to you that a human soul be there as the eternal monument of mankind, we can put you back when you die. But in the meantime, we think Shinji and a few others would miss you if you left too soon."
如果对你来说，人类的灵魂作为永恒的纪念碑如此重要，我们可以在你死后将你复活。但在此之前，我们认为真嗣和其他几个人会因为你的过早离去而感到难过。

"I was his son. All I wanted was for him to look at me. He was my father. How could he just send me away, and only call me back because he needed something from me? He wouldn't even let me try to stop the Angel attacking Asuka. He was just fine risking me every other time," Shinji said into the table. "I hate him."
我是他的儿子。我所希望的只是他能看我一眼。他是我的父亲。他怎么能就这样把我送走，只在我对他有用时才叫我回来？他甚至不允许我尝试阻止攻击明日香的使徒。他每次都愿意冒险让我去，" 真嗣对着桌子说道，"我恨他。

"Would you like to see him burn? I can do that, have done that in a universe where Gendo was... too far gone to be brought back from evil. He killed the Shinji of that world, pulled the trigger himself because he thought killing his own son was the only way to save his precious Scenario. I set him aflame and kept him alive as he burned, and I would do it again with little remorse. Is that what you wish?" Rayana asked levelly. "He's still alive right now, down on your Earth. Winthrop had him tossed into a deep cell just in case he ever needed him again. That is why I stopped us here; to decide if our next stop would be to retrieve him, or let him rot. And we need not retrieve him just to rescue him. We could make your… displeasure felt."
你想看他燃烧吗？我可以做到，在某个宇宙中，源堂已经……堕落得太深，无法从邪恶中挽回。他亲手杀死了那个世界的真嗣，扣动扳机，因为他认为杀死自己的儿子是拯救他宝贵计划的唯一方法。我让他燃烧并保持他活着，直到火焰吞噬他，如果需要，我会毫不犹豫地再次这样做。这是你希望的吗？" 雷亚娜平静地问道。"他现在还活着，就在你们的地球上。温沃斯把他关进了一个深牢，以防将来还需要他。这就是我带我们来到这里的原因；决定我们的下一站是去救他，还是让他腐烂。而且我们不必仅仅为了救他而去救他。我们可以让你……的不满得到宣泄。

Yui sat up straight. "He's still alive?! We have to rescue him!"
唯坐直了身子。"他还活着？！我们必须去救他！"

Rayana regarded her coolly. "He did some terrible things to your son and those around him in the name of his Scenario, and he must answer for those many sins. You may be his wife, but are you not Shinji's mother too? In either case, you do not get to make the decision. We are here as Shinji's friends, not yours. You may plead Gendo's case, but Shinji is the judge."
雷亚娜冷冷地看着她。“他为了他的剧本，对你的儿子以及周围的人做了很多可怕的事，他必须为此付出代价。你可能是他的妻子，但你也是真嗣的母亲，不是吗？无论哪种情况，你都没有决定权。我们作为真嗣的朋友来到这里，而不是你的。你可以为元渡辩护，但真嗣才是审判者。”

Shinji watched his right hand clench and release on the table. What did he want to do with his father? Revenge for all the years of pain? Walk away? 'Father, who am I to you?'
真嗣看着自己的右手在桌上紧握又松开。他到底想怎么对待自己的父亲？是为了多年来痛苦而复仇？还是转身离开？'父亲，我对你来说是谁？'

"If it helps, Shinji, the failure of his plan and the realization that Rei III, whom he regarded as something of a proxy for your mother, rejected him and everything he was trying to do seems to have broken him. You saw that clip of his so-called 'trial'. Did he seem the man you remember? Or was he more like you, withdrawn and carrying terrible pain? He almost broke down having to read off a list of people he was accused of murdering that included your mother," Rayana said. "'A heart set on love can do no wrong,' Confucius said. Your father seemed to have taken that as his justification. He may have been mad…but he had acted as a man in love. He would do anything to get his undounamata back. And for full and certain do I know that love can make madmen of any of us."
如果这有助于理解，真嗣，他的计划失败以及意识到第三代绫波，他视其为某种意义上的你母亲的替身，拒绝了他和他所做的一切，似乎已经让他崩溃了。你看过他所谓的'审判'片段。他还是你记忆中的那个人吗？还是更像你，退缩并承受着巨大的痛苦？他几乎崩溃，不得不念出一份包括你母亲在内的被指控谋杀的人名单，"雷亚娜说。"'心中有爱，便不会做错事'，孔子说。你父亲似乎将此作为他的辩护理由。他可能疯了……但他确实是以爱的名义行事。他会不惜一切代价找回他的'未竟之志'。我确信无疑，爱能让我们任何人都变成疯子。

Shinji drew a deep breath and let it out. "I…I don't want him to die. I don't want anyone to die. I did what I had to in the coup for Asuka's sake. I'd rather not kill at all."
真嗣深吸了一口气，然后缓缓呼出。"我……我不想他死。我不想任何人死。为了明日香，我在政变中做了我必须做的事。我宁愿不杀人。"

Rayana tilted her head. "How about we just make sure you get a chance to give him a god-almighty punch in the face when we pick him up?"
拉亚娜歪了歪头，“要不我们就确保你有机会在我们接他的时候给他一记重重的耳光？”

Shinji considered it for a moment. "I think I can do that."
真嗣考虑了一会儿，“我觉得我能做到。”

Rayana smiled. "Then so mote it be." She stood up from the table and drained her cup of tea. It and the pitcher vanished when she tossed the cup over her shoulder. "Shall we go pay him a visit, then?"
瑞亚娜微笑着说：“那就这么办吧。”她从桌边站起身，喝完了杯中的茶。当她将茶杯向后抛去时，茶杯和茶壶都消失了。“我们去拜访他一下如何？”

Yui placed her coffee mug on the table. "Let's. It appears I will have a lot to talk about with my husband. He always was lost without me."
结衣将咖啡杯放在桌上。“走吧。看来我有很多话要和丈夫谈了。他总是离不开我。”

Shinji stood up a moment later. "Let's go."
片刻后，真嗣站了起来。“我们走吧。”

Rayana snapped her fingers, and Eva Unit-01 was alone at the L4 point with the Lance still spinning slowly in front of it.
蕾安娜打了个响指，零号机独自留在了 L4 点，朗基努斯之枪仍在其前方缓缓旋转。

### Chapter 07 Hurting Each Other

"I think you needed that, Asuka."
我觉得你需要那个，明日香。

Asuka finally picked herself up off the floor of the tent, still giggling and wiping at her eyes. "Gott, I wish I could have seen that. Hee hee. Dr. Akagi always did need to loosen up."
明日香终于从帐篷的地板上站起来，依旧咯咯笑着，擦着眼角的泪水。"天哪，真希望我当时能看到那一幕。嘻嘻。赤木博士确实需要放松一下。"

"A bit too much of my capacity is tied up right now, but remind me when we get back home to Avalon and I'll be sure you get to see that. My memory is a pretty good archive," Daniel said. His voice gained a stronger note of concern. "Asuka, how long is it since you've had a good laugh like that?"
我现在大部分的容量都被占用了，但提醒我等我们回到阿瓦隆家时，我一定会让你看到那个。我的记忆是一个相当不错的档案库，"丹尼尔说。他的声音中多了一丝担忧。"明日香，你有多久没有那样开怀大笑了？

Her laughter finally quieted and a pensive look grew on her face. "Ah…I can't remember. A long while."
她的笑声终于平息，脸上浮现出沉思的表情。"啊……我不记得了。已经很久了。"

"Years? At all since the Angel War?"
多年了？自从天使战争以来？

"….no. Not that I can think of," Asuka eventually admitted. Her voice was much more subdued.
"……不，我想不起来，" 明日香最终承认道。她的声音变得低沉许多。

"Too many years of sacrificing all pride, hope, dignity, and self-respect in the name of survival leaves little spark left for laughter, mm?"
为了生存，牺牲了所有的骄傲、希望、尊严和自尊，这么多年下来，留给笑声的火花已经所剩无几了，嗯？

"I guess something like that, yeah."
我想大概是这么回事，嗯。

"And you bore it all alone."
而你独自承受了这一切。

"Yes." Asuka could hear the fatigue in her voice. "I did. I always have. I don't need anyone."
是的。" 明日香能听出她声音中的疲惫。"我确实如此。我一直是这样。我不需要任何人。

"That doesn't mean it wouldn't be nice to have someone to bear it with. Shared burdens are halved. Shared joys are squared," Daniel replied.
"这并不意味着有人分担不会更好。共同承担的负担减半，共享的喜悦倍增，" 丹尼尔回答道。

"If I'd had anyone close to me, Winthrop would just have used them as more leverage against me. I don't need anyone."
如果我身边有亲近的人，温思罗普只会利用他们来进一步对我施压。我不需要任何人。

"Asuka, do you remember why you started to say that in the first place?" He pointedly looked down at her mother. "You're going to have her back. You're going to have at least one person you know loves you unconditionally. You won't have to be so hard anymore."
明日香，你还记得最初为什么要说那些话吗？" 他刻意地低头看向她的母亲。"你会重新拥有她的。你至少会拥有一个你认识的、无条件爱你的人。你不必再那么坚强了。

Asuka was silent, staring at her mother's face.
明日香沉默着，凝视着母亲的脸庞。

Daniel continued more gently. "It's a sad piece of irony, that one of the things that hurt you so much was caused by how much your mother loved you. That was the part that was absorbed by Unit-02 during the Contact Experiment. It was such a big part of her that what was left was damaged and insane…. and after the Experiment she could only see that doll as you. But even with everything in her that recognized you torn out of her, she still tried to comfort and care for her Asuka…Even with that part of her soul gone, she still loved you."
丹尼尔继续温和地说道："这是一种悲哀的讽刺，让你深受伤害的一件事，恰恰是因为你母亲太爱你了。那部分在接触实验中被二号机吸收了。那是她如此重要的一部分，以至于剩下的部分变得残缺和疯狂……实验后，她只能把那个玩偶看作是你。尽管她灵魂中识别你的那部分被撕裂，她仍然试图安慰和照顾她的明日香……即使那部分灵魂消失了，她依然爱你。"

Asuka made no attempt to stop her tears now. "Mama… I…"
明日香不再试图抑制自己的泪水。"妈妈……我……"

"You can be alone, Asuka. It's just much better not to have to be. Your mother will always love you, no matter what. I hope that having her back will give you the courage to take a chance at more. A mother's love is a low fire that you always can count on. The love of another that freely chooses you, and you freely choose them… is something else entirely. It gives you wings. You just need the courage to jump off the edge, and never worry about the fall."
你可以独自一人，明日香。只是不必要地独处会更好。无论发生什么，你的母亲永远爱你。我希望她的归来能给你勇气去尝试更多。母爱是你可以永远依靠的温暖火焰。而另一个自由选择你，你也自由选择他们的人的爱……则是完全不同的存在。它赋予你翅膀。你只需要勇气跳下边缘，永远不用担心坠落。

Asuka shook her head. "If I have Mama back, I don't need anyone else."
明日香摇了摇头。"如果妈妈回来了，我就不需要其他人了。"

"You shouldn't be so quick to reject the idea, Asuka. You don't even know what you're missing. Wait a second, yes you do. I heard Lieutenant Leibshott tell you this morning on the beach. That wave that hit you all? That's what Raye and I feel all the time. You felt a small echo of what every moment of our lives together have been like."
明日香，你不应该这么快就拒绝这个想法。你甚至不知道你错过了什么。等一下，你确实知道。我听到莱布施特中尉今天早上在海滩上告诉你。那个击中你们的波浪？那就是雷伊和我一直感受到的。你感受到了我们共同生活中每一刻的一小部分回声。

Asuka winced and closed her eyes tightly. "That was…that was cruel, to make me feel something like that, then take it away so fast. Why did you do that to me?"
明日香皱眉并紧紧闭上眼睛。"那真是……太残忍了，让我感受到那样的东西，然后又那么快地夺走。你们为什么要这样对我？"

"That was an echo, Asuka. You can't listen to an echo for long. If you want that for yourself, you're going to have to reach out and grasp it. You have that power. Do you recall what my lady wife said to you on the beach this morning?"
那是一个回声，明日香。你不能长时间聆听回声。如果你想要那样的事物，你就必须伸出手去抓住它。你有那样的力量。你还记得今天早上在海滩上我妻子对你说了什么吗？

"…how do you know she said anything?"
…你怎么知道她说了什么？

Daniel's smile was slight, and his eyes were far away. "When you talk to one of us, you talk to both of us, Asuka. Raye and I were finishing each other's sentences and deep in each other's heads before we were married, and while we were still unaltered mortals! We've been so close and married so long, it's only gotten stronger. That's part of what it means, to be undounamata; one is two are one. She knows what I know. I know what she knows. We feel each other's presence, thoughts, and spirits constantly. But do you recall what she said?"
丹尼尔的微笑微弱，眼神遥远。"当你与我们中的一个交谈时，你就是在与我们两个交谈，明日香。雷伊和我结婚前，甚至在还是未被改造的凡人时，就已经能互相接完对方的话，深入对方的心灵！我们如此亲密，结婚这么久，这种联系只会变得更强烈。这就是成为'undounamata'的一部分含义；一即是二，二即是一。她知道我所知道的。我知道她所知道的。我们不断地感受到彼此的存在、思想和灵魂。但你还记不记得她说了什么？"

"How nice for you," Asuka said, tired envy in her voice. "She promised I would feel that way again soon."
真好啊，"明日香带着疲惫的羡慕说道，"她承诺我很快也会再次感受到那种感觉。

"And have we kept our promises so far?" He looked down again.
"我们至今是否遵守了承诺？" 他再次低头看去。

"…yes. So what are you going to do, hit me with that 'echo' again? That would satisfy the letter of your promise."
……是的。那你打算怎么办，再用那个'回声'来打击我吗？那样确实符合你承诺的字面意思。

"Rather cynical to suggest that, Asuka. Though given the last few years you've had, I can't say you don't have a well-founded fear of pious rhetoric. But we are not a society of rules lawyers. I'd say your self of six months hence seemed to bear out my wife's promise to you. You have a better advantage than most people; you know in six months what you will be like."
阿苏卡，你这么提议未免太悲观了。不过考虑到你过去几年的经历，我不能说你对虔诚言辞的恐惧没有根据。但我们不是一个只讲规则的社会。我可以说，你六个月后的自己似乎证实了我妻子对你的承诺。你比大多数人有优势；你提前六个月就知道自己会变成什么样。

"But I don't know!" she exclaimed. "I have no idea how I could turn into her! I don't have that in me! I told him to his face I don't love him, and I meant it! I've given up so much of myself to stay alive I don't even think I can love anyone anymore! Why the Hell would he want me? All I ever do is hurt him. I say stupid, ugly things to him without even thinking! He gives money and food like an idiot wanna-be Buddha to people the secret police are dragging off, and I'm too scared of them dragging us off too to do anything but yell at him for doing it! I watch them break people and stick them up on wheels over the market and don't even care anymore! I sold myself to Winthrop to save my own skin!"
但她不知道！"她惊呼道，"我根本不知道自己怎么会变成她！我没有那样的本事！我当面对他说我不爱他，我是认真的！为了活下去，我已经放弃了自己太多，甚至觉得再也无法爱上任何人了！他到底为什么要我？我只会伤害他。我总是不经大脑地对他说些愚蠢、丑陋的话！他像个傻瓜似的想当佛陀，给那些被秘密警察抓走的人钱和食物，而我因为害怕我们也被抓走，除了对他大吼大叫什么也做不了！我看着他们折磨人，把人挂在市场上的轮子上，却已经麻木不仁！为了自保，我把自己卖给了温思罗普！

"And he still wrote that note he put in your dresser, taking all the blame for being part of the coup."
而他还是写了那张放在你抽屉里的纸条，把参与政变的责任全揽在自己身上。

"So he could still be the fucking hero-martyr-wannabe the way he always did!"
这样他就能继续像以前那样，当个该死的英雄-烈士-模仿者！

"He did it for you. He did it because the world he blamed himself for creating was killing you. You were the only thing in his life he still had to protect. He felt he had failed everyone else in the Angel War. He didn't do it to be a hero. Did he ever once sound like he wanted to be an Eva Pilot? He hated every minute of it, even when the safety of humanity was on the line. But he did it anyhow. You've seen it yourself; within weeks of meeting you, he was willing to jump headfirst into a live volcano against orders for the chance to save you."
他为你做了这件事。他这么做是因为他自责创造的世界正在伤害你。你是他生活中唯一还需要保护的东西。他觉得自己在天使战争中辜负了所有人。他这么做并非想成为英雄。他可曾有一次听起来像是想成为 Eva 驾驶员？他痛恨每一分钟，即使人类的安危岌岌可危。但他还是这么做了。你自己也看到了；在遇见你几周内，他就愿意违抗命令，为了救你而跳进活火山。

Asuka looked away. "And I paid him back for that on the next angel! Anyway, that idiot would have done it for Wondergirl too. It wasn't because it was me."
明日香转过头去。“而且我在下一次面对使徒时就回报了他！再说，那个笨蛋也会为 Wondergirl 做同样的事。并不是因为那是我。”

"He might, but not for the same reasons. He'd have done the same to save Ayanami-san because she was a fellow Pilot, and someone he wanted to protect. He was ready to spit in his father's face and walk away the first time Commander Ikari told him to pilot Eva Unit-01. He did it anyway, because otherwise they would have yanked Ayanami-san out of her hospital bed and sent her into battle with the same kind of wounds you had when you woke up on that beach. He always was willing to fight to protect others. But you…he dove into that volcano, he volunteered himself as a replacement for you in Winthrop's bed, he wrote that note, because he'd rather die than see you get hurt. That's what finally broke him, when Commander Ikari set off the Third Impact; getting to the surface and seeing Unit-02 torn to pieces, after he had to hear you fight the Mass Production Evas alone. He tried to come to your aid. Eva Unit-01 was shoulder deep in Bakelite."
他或许会这么做，但理由不同。他会为了拯救绫波而采取同样行动，因为她也是一名驾驶员，是他想要保护的人。当碇司令第一次命令他驾驶 EVA 初号机时，他本已准备好唾弃父亲并转身离开。但他还是照做了，因为如果不这样，他们就会把绫波从病床上拖起来，让她带着和你醒来时在海滩上一样的伤势投入战斗。他总是愿意为保护他人而战。但你……他跳进火山，自愿代替你躺在温索普的床上，写下那张字条，因为他宁愿自己死去也不愿看到你受伤。正是这最终击垮了他，当碇司令引发第三次冲击时；当他浮出水面，看到零号机被撕成碎片，而他不得不听着你独自对抗量产型 EVA。他试图前来援助。EVA 初号机已经深陷在聚合树脂中。

"No he didn't! I saw it! During Instrumentality, I saw everything! He just sat there! He sat on the gangway, wallowing in self-pity, and just stared at Eva Unit-01 while I was fighting for my life!
不，他没有！我亲眼所见！在人类补完计划期间，我看到了一切！他就坐在那里！他坐在通道上，沉浸在自怜之中，只是盯着 EVA 初号机，而我却在为生存而战！

"So you're mad at him for not helping you when you really needed it, and you think he could have done something, but didn't?" Daniel's tone was still perfectly even.
"所以你因为他没有在你真正需要的时候帮助你而生气，你认为他本可以做些什么，但却没有做？" 丹尼尔的语气依然非常平稳。

"Yes!" Asuka's was not. "是的！" 明日香的语气则不然。

"So when he was literally begging you for help during Instrumentality, and you could have done something, but you refused to help him, that was different... how?"
那么，当他实际上在求你帮助他度过人类补完计划时，你本可以做些什么，但你却拒绝帮助他，这又有什么不同呢？

"It... that... I didn't try to kill him after he didn't help me!"
那...那...我并没有在他没有帮助我之后试图杀了他！

"There are a lot of ways to kill someone that leaves a perfectly healthy breathing body behind, Asuka. You should know that; you got yours at the hands of the 15th Angel. He was in the middle of a total psychological collapse when you were fighting on the surface. He had just watched Major Katsuragi die protecting him, and a few days before he had to kill Nagisa-san, the only person in his whole life's memories that had ever shown him any affection. Where were you in the hour before that moment? Sitting at the bottom of a lake in Unit-02, catatonic." Daniel looked up at the ceiling. "When you were being... violated by Arael, Shinji demanded his father release the freeze on Eva Unit-01 while you were under attack, so he could go to you, try to help you. Commander Ikari refused him. Shinji knew the risks. He'd just seen it happen to you. He still wanted to help you. Mmm, that's another thing we need to 'discuss' with Commander Ikari shortly."
有很多种方法可以在杀死某人后留下一个完全健康的呼吸着的身体，明日香。你应该知道这一点；你的遭遇是在第 15 使徒手中。当你在地面上战斗时，他正处于完全的心理崩溃之中。他刚刚目睹了葛城少校为了保护他而死去，而在几天前，他不得不杀死渚薰，这是他一生记忆中唯一一个曾对他表示过任何关爱的人。在那之前的那个小时，你在哪里？坐在二号机的底部，处于湖底，处于紧张性精神症状态。"丹尼尔抬头看向天花板。"当你被...阿拉尔侵犯时，真嗣要求他的父亲解除对初号机的冻结，以便在你受到攻击时去帮助你。伊卡里指挥官拒绝了他。真嗣知道风险。他刚刚目睹了你的遭遇。他仍然想帮助你。嗯，这是我们不久需要与伊卡里指挥官'讨论'的另一件事。

His gaze came back down to Asuka, who was glaring at him.
他的目光回到明日香身上，她正瞪着他。

"Like I said last night, you have no idea how much that boy has bled for you. And will. He won't give up on you. He won't leave you, Asuka. Not for anything. Protecting and being with you gives meaning to his life."
就像我昨晚说的，你根本不知道那个男孩为你流了多少血，而且还会继续。他不会放弃你，不会离开你，明日香。无论什么情况都不会。保护你并与你在一起，赋予了他生命的意义。

"I don't need protecting! I don't need anyone!"
我不需要保护！我不需要任何人！

"Then his job will be easy. Unless you want him to go away? I can make him vanish, put him on a world so far away he'll never see you again. Is that what you want?"
那他的任务就简单了。除非你希望他离开？我可以让他消失，把他送到一个遥远的世界，他再也见不到你。这是你想要的吗？

A spike of fear shot through her. "No! Stop saying that! I don't want...him... to go away." She ended much softer than she began, surprised at her own vehemence.
她心中突然涌起一阵恐惧。"不！别这么说！我不想...他...离开。"她结束时比开始时温柔得多，对自己激烈的反应感到惊讶。

Daniel cocked his head to the side and his lips curled in a half-smile. "You know, you're so contrary I wonder if the best way to make you grab onto Shinji harder is to forbid you to see him. Worked for Prospero, no? Alas, you are not Miranda." His smile faded. "He'd do anything for you. That's why he wrote that note; dying bothered him less than the idea of you getting hurt when he could do something about it. But as brave as he can be facing death, he can be as big a chicken as I was when it comes to something much more scary: telling the girl you like how you feel about her."
丹尼尔歪着头，嘴角勾起一丝半笑。“你知道吗，你这么倔强，我怀疑让你更紧地抓住真嗣的最好办法就是禁止你见他。对普洛斯彼罗来说这招有效，不是吗？唉，你不是米兰达。”他的笑容消失了。“他愿意为你做任何事。这就是他写那张纸条的原因；比起自己死去，他更害怕你因为他能做些什么而受到伤害。但面对死亡他可以勇敢，面对更可怕的事情——向你表白他的感情时，他却像我一样胆小。”

"In his usual half-assed cowardly way, he tried it, in the Entry Plug after the fighting during the coup. I told him the truth; I don't love him. I just didn't want to be alone, and he was all that's left for me."
以他一贯的懦弱方式，他在政变战斗后的插入栓里尝试了。我告诉他真相；我不爱他。我只是不想孤单，而他是我仅剩的一切。

"Actually, he chickened out even more than you think. Didn't you notice? He didn't tell you how he felt. He got halfway towards asking what you thought of him. He never told you what he felt about you. He would be a lot more to you if you'd let him. He'd give you everything."
实际上，他比你想象的还要胆小。你没注意到吗？他并没有告诉你他的感受。他只是半途而废地问你对他的看法。他从未向你表达过他对你的感情。如果你允许他，他会为你付出一切。

"Then he's an idiot. I don't love him. I don't need him to push that kind of thing on me. It was painful enough when he rejected me again."
然后他就是个白痴。我不爱他。我不需要他向我施加那种压力。当他再次拒绝我时，我已经够痛苦了。

"...Do you mean when he stopped when he was about to have sex with you?"
...你是说当他即将和你发生性关系时停下来了吗？

Asuka tried to meet his eyes. After a few seconds, her attempt at a glare faded into staring at her mother's hands. "Yes," she said very quietly.
明日香试图直视他的眼睛。几秒钟后，她那试图瞪视的眼神变成了盯着母亲的手。"是的，"她非常轻声地说。

"He didn't reject you. I know it may have seemed like that to you, but you need to keep a couple things in mind. For one, he has never had sex with anyone. He's only even ever had three kisses in his life: you, that night in Major Kasturagi's apartment, her, right before she died, and giving you mouth-to-mouth in your Berlin apartment. He's been attracted to you since the moment he set eyes on you, but never done anything with anyone. So having his first sexual experience be with you has literally been a dream of his for years. Two-"
他没有拒绝你。我知道在你看来可能是那样，但你需要记住几件事。首先，他从没有和任何人发生过性关系。他一生中只有过三次接吻：你，那晚在葛城少校的公寓里，她，就在她去世前，还有在你柏林的公寓里给你做人工呼吸。自从他第一眼看到你，他就对你产生了吸引力，但从未与任何人有过任何行为。所以，能和你共度他的第一次性经历，对他来说已经是多年的梦想。第二点——

Asuka's eyes shot back up to burn at Daniel's. "So why the fuck did he just stop, lay down, and pull the covers over himself?! I wasn't stopping him! I offered him everything he wanted and he just...he didn't even want me! He wouldn't even touch me! He wouldn't even look at me! WHY WOULDN'T HE LOOK AT ME?" Asuka was honestly screaming at him now.
明日香的目光猛地回到丹尼尔身上，怒视着他。“那他妈的为什么他突然停下来，躺下，还拉上被子盖住自己？！我又没阻止他！我给了他想要的一切，而他只是……他甚至不想要我！他甚至不愿意碰我！他甚至不愿意看我！为什么他不愿意看我？”明日香现在真的是在对他尖叫。

"Because he could see your eyes." Daniel's level tone was just adding to her fury now.
“因为他能看到你的眼睛。”丹尼尔平静的语气现在只是让她更加愤怒。

"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!"
“这他妈的是什么意思？！”

"He could see your eyes. You weren't there; you were looking as far from him as you could, and trying to be a thousand miles away. He could see in your eyes that you were the farthest thing from enjoying yourself. He knew what Winthrop had done to you. He wanted to be with you, so much so he could taste it. But he didn't want it at the cost of hurting you more. He didn't stop because he doesn't want you. He stopped because he'd rather not have you if that means he has to hurt you to do so."
“他能看见你的眼睛。你不在那里；你尽可能地远离他，试图让自己离他千里之外。他能从你的眼神中看出你根本没有享受。他知道温斯洛对你做了什么。他非常想和你在一起，以至于他能感受到那种渴望。但他不想以伤害你为代价来得到你。他停下来不是因为他不想要你。他停下来是因为他宁愿不要你，也不愿通过伤害你来得到你。”

Silence reigned in the tent for a moment.
帐篷里一时寂静无声。

"That's as close to a simple definition of love that I've arrived at that I can tell you in plain German, Asuka; when their happiness matters more than yours. When their happiness is yours. Why do you think he buys you all those video games and math books?"
那就是我能用简单的德语告诉你的关于爱的定义，明日香；当他们的幸福比你的更重要。当他们的幸福就是你的幸福。你认为他为什么要给你买那么多电子游戏和数学书？

"Because I told him to look for them for me." Her fury had deserted her. Her voice faded to merely sullen.
"因为我让他帮我找这些东西。" 她的怒气已经消散，声音变得只是有些闷闷不乐。

"Because you give him the tiniest wisp of a smile and call him 'baka' in that tone of voice when you get them from him."
因为你从他那里拿到这些东西时，给他一个最微小的微笑，并用那种语气叫他'笨蛋'。

"Then he's just what I call him, an idiot! I don't love him! I told him that!"
然后我就叫他傻瓜，一个白痴！我不爱他！我告诉过他了！

"And he does it anyway. Another thing I learned a long time ago, Asuka: Just because you love someone, doesn't mean they have to love you back. But sometimes... you don't mind."
可他还是这么做了。很久以前我就学到了一点，明日香：即使你爱一个人，也不意味着他们必须爱你。但有时候...你并不介意。

"So what? After a while he'll realize I'm not going to be what he wants and leave, find someone else. Someone who will give him what he's looking for."
那又怎样？过不了多久他就会意识到我不是他想要的人，然后离开，去找别人。找一个能给他想要的人。

"So why shouldn't that be you? You told him you don't love him. Fine. You're allowed to change your mind. You know why he froze that time you kissed him during the Angel War?"
那为什么不能是你呢？你告诉他你不爱他。好吧。你有权改变主意。你知道为什么那次在天使战争中你吻他时他会愣住吗？

"He was rejecting me, just like later. He didn't want me. If he'd wanted me he would have held me."
他当时在拒绝我，就像后来那样。他并不想要我。如果他真的想要我，他就会抱住我。

"Wrong. He thought you were gorgeous, brilliant, fiery, exotic, and braver than he thought he could ever be. And then one night he's just playing his cello, listening to his old SDAT, and suddenly, out of nothing, the girl of his dreams demands a kiss. From him. You felt too good to be real. His brain just flat locked up because he couldn't believe you were really there in front of him, offering your lips. Total blue-screen-of-death." Daniel gave her another half-smile. "You have no idea how completely you could have claimed him if you'd just grabbed him that night. He'd have been utterly yours forever, instantly. I've seen that in more than a few worlds. One time a 'you' did that, it caused a chain of events that resulted in Suzuhara-san and Horaki-san getting married within a few months." He laughed. "And you two nearly gave Major Kasturagi grey hair trying to stop you and Shinji from having constant horny-teenagers-in-love sex in the apartment. The apartment with very thin walls, mind you. You two were having the time of your lives every night, she was getting zero sleep, and was more than a little envious."
错了。他觉得你美艳绝伦、才华横溢、热情如火、异国风情，而且比他想象中自己能有的勇气还要勇敢。然后有一天晚上，他只是在拉大提琴，听着旧的 SDAT 播放器，突然间，毫无预兆地，他梦中的女孩向他索吻。你给他的感觉太美好了，简直不真实。他的大脑直接宕机，因为他无法相信你真的就在他面前，献上你的唇。简直是彻底的蓝屏死机。"丹尼尔对她又露出了半笑。"你根本不知道，如果你那晚真的抓住了他，你完全有可能彻底拥有他。他会立刻、永远地属于你。我在多个世界中见过这种情况。有一次，一个'你'这么做了，引发了一系列事件，导致铃原先生和洞木小姐在几个月内就结婚了。"他笑了起来。"而你们俩差点让葛城少校因为阻止你们和真嗣在公寓里不断上演热恋中的青少年性爱而白了头。要知道，那公寓的墙非常薄。你们俩每晚都过得无比快乐，她却完全睡不着，而且相当嫉妒。"

Asuka boggled slightly at the idea of Hikari and Touji getting married while still in school with her. She managed to contain her amusement at picturing Misato losing sleep trying to stop her to a simple snort. She still didn't feel like playing along with where Daniel was going with this.
明日香对光和冬二在学校期间结婚的想法略感困惑。她勉强忍住笑意，想象着美里为了阻止自己而失眠的情景，只发出了一声轻笑。她仍然不想顺着丹尼尔的思路走。

"Good for them," she said sourly. "I'm not her. I was a fool back then. I thought I could save the world. Look where it is now."
“他们真行，”她酸溜溜地说，“我不是她。我那时真傻，以为自己能拯救世界。看看现在成了什么样子。”

"You can tell me you don't care, Asuka, but I did notice from the glimpses of your thoughts the days before and during the coup that you spent a bit of time very carefully not thinking about some things."
“你可以告诉我你不在乎，明日香，但我从政变前后的几天里，从你思绪的片段中注意到，你花了不少时间非常小心地不去想某些事情。”

She snorted again, this time not in amusement. "Like what?"
她再次嗤之以鼻，这次不是因为好笑。“比如什么？”

"You were just getting rid of an old SDAT player that was laying around when you left it on Shinji's bed, mm? Even he noticed the week old price sticker."
你刚好在清理一个闲置的 SDAT 播放器，然后就把它放在了真嗣的床上，对吧？连他都注意到了那张已经贴了一个星期的价格标签。

Asuka reddened slightly. "So I got him a tape player, so what? It was just a welcoming present."
明日香微微脸红，说：“所以我给他买了个磁带播放器，那又怎样？只是个欢迎礼物而已。”

"One that you felt it necessary to lie about why you gave it to him? And an SDAT tape player, in 2020 Berlin? That must have been about as easy as finding mint-condition Space Shuttle parts. And for Avalon's sake, even Winthrop noticed that you had to have a different, personal reason for joining the coup besides just to avenge your mother."
有必要为此撒谎吗？在 2020 年的柏林，一个 SDAT 磁带播放器，那简直比找到崭新的航天飞机零件还难。而且，为了阿瓦隆的名义，连温思罗普都注意到，你参与政变除了为母亲报仇之外，肯定还有其他个人原因。

She got redder, but this time held her tongue. She couldn't think of anything to rebut that with. Then she rallied, "My mother's not enough?"
她的脸更红了，但这次她没有反驳。她想不出任何可以反驳的话。然后她振作起来，问道：“难道我母亲的理由还不够吗？”

"Not when I know you were lying when you told Shinji that it was what got you to join the coup. I don't know for sure what you were thinking then, but I do know that saying it was for your mother was an excuse you'd had to grope for."
并非如此，我知道你告诉真嗣是因为这个才加入政变时在撒谎。我不确定你当时是怎么想的，但我知道说为了你母亲只是你不得不找的借口。

Asuka shifted uncomfortably. "I don't want to talk about this anymore."
明日香不安地挪动了一下。“我不想再谈这个了。”

"Fair enough. Think about it, though, please. Let me ask you a question: Do you like the way your personal life was before I walked in to your tent?"
好吧。但请考虑一下，让我问你个问题：你喜欢我走进你帐篷之前你的个人生活吗？

"It was as good as I could hope for in that world. I was needed, an Eva Pilot, and I wasn't alone," Asuka said with little conviction.
"在那样的世界里，我已经很满足了。我被需要，是一名 EVA 驾驶员，而且我并不孤单。" 明日香说着，语气中缺乏信心。

"But you don't really like the way things are? Then change them. Change the whole world. The gods are on your side now. We can rearrange the stars for you. All you need is the courage to say what you want. You say you don't need anyone. Are you afraid to reach out?"
但你真的不喜欢现状吗？那就改变它。改变整个世界。现在神明站在你这边。我们可以为你重新排列星辰。你所需要的只是勇气，说出你想要什么。你说你不需要任何人。你害怕伸出援手吗？

"I'm not...I don't need..."
我并不是...我不需要...

Daniel broke in on her stuttering reply. "You don't need to say anything. Hold on for a moment, my wife and I need to switch sides so I can talk to Shinji and party for a bit."
丹尼尔打断了她结结巴巴的回答。"你不需要说什么。稍等一下，我和我妻子需要换一下位置，这样我才能和真嗣他们聊一会儿。"

"What are you talking about now?" Asuka stiffened. "Is she about to show up here again? I thought you weren't going to do that to me!"
你现在又在说什么？" 明日香紧张起来。"她又要来这里了吗？我以为你不会再这样对我了！

"Not at all. Most of me is still working on your mother. She'll just be borrowing my voice here while I talk there. I need to talk to Shinji's mother, and she's got something she wants to say to you on this topic. Hello, dear." Daniel's voice suddenly rose to a contralto. "Ah, thank you, love. Hello, Asuka. Good to see your mother again, I bet."
一点也不。我大部分还在忙你母亲的事。她只是借用我的声音在这里说话，而我需要和真嗣的母亲交谈，她在这个话题上有些话想对你说。你好，亲爱的。" 丹尼尔的声音突然提高到了女低音。"啊，谢谢你，亲爱的。你好，明日香。再次见到你母亲，你一定很高兴吧。

Asuka blinked and shook her head. These people were strange.
明日香眨了眨眼，摇了摇头。这些人真奇怪。

"So you're afraid," Rayana's voice said. Asuka bristled, but was abruptly derailed when the other woman added a touch wryly. "Welcome to the club."
所以你害怕了，" 雷亚娜的声音说道。明日香感到愤怒，但当另一个女人带着一丝戏谑地补充时，她突然被打断了。"欢迎加入俱乐部。

"Er, what?" Asuka blinked, startled. Rayana's voice chuckled.
"呃，什么？" 明日香眨了眨眼，感到惊讶。雷亚娜的声音轻笑起来。

"What, were you expecting me to say something like, 'Fear is the mind-killer, the little death, the destroyer'?" she said, her tone just faintly teasing. "The truth is it's not unusual to be afraid of being happy. When I first met Daniel... well, for all my sensitivity to the Energies of the Universe, I was still very young and Young, and the connection between me and a complete stranger was so... strong, so powerful, far more so than with any other I had connected with previously... I was terrified, afraid that I was imagining things, that if I made a move it would blow up in my face... I was so cautious that I very nearly Friend Zoned him in what I believed to be self-defense, and even when it became obvious that he would stay with me, I feared it. I told him flatly that he couldn't ask me to marry him until we had been together five years."
"怎么，你以为我会说些类似'恐惧是心灵的杀手，是微小的死亡，是毁灭者'的话吗？" 她说道，语气中带着一丝淡淡的戏谑。"事实上，害怕幸福并不罕见。当我第一次遇见丹尼尔时...尽管我对宇宙能量的感知很敏锐，但我那时还很年轻，与一个完全陌生的人之间的联系竟如此...强烈，如此有力，远超过我之前与任何人的联系...我感到非常害怕，担心自己是在幻想，担心一旦有所行动就会适得其反...我过于谨慎，几乎出于自我保护的本能将他归入了朋友区，即使后来明显看出他会留在我身边，我仍然害怕。我直截了当地告诉他，在我们在一起五年之前，他不能向我求婚。"

Daniel's body blushed faintly. "There were extenuating circumstances surrounding that, but I was determined to hold to it... except I couldn't." He smiled softly, his eyes shining. "I got impatient and began to ask him to marry me. Occasionally in the most awkward, inappropriate places, like the middle of watching a live performance of 'Othello'. He was rather dismayed by that one," Rayana's voice giggled. "The point is, I took a chance that what I was feeling, what I was trying to pretend I didn't feel, might be real and true and requited, and it was worth everything. Yes, I could have lost him at any number of points, and I know all too well how losing him would utterly shatter me, but the joy I have with him is worth the possibility of pain. Being apart from him hurts, yes, but that only makes our reunions sweeter. As you may recall." Daniel's body smiled softly. "It's okay to be afraid sometimes, Asuka, but never let that fear hold you back from the chance of true happiness."
丹尼尔的身体微微泛红。“那件事周围有一些情有可原的情况，但我决心坚持下去……只是我做不到。”他温柔地笑了，眼中闪着光。“我变得不耐烦，开始向他求婚。偶尔在最尴尬、不合适的地方，比如在观看《奥赛罗》现场表演的中间。他对那一次感到相当沮丧，”雷亚娜的声音咯咯笑着说。“关键是，我冒险相信我所感受到的，我试图假装没有感受到的，可能是真实、真诚且得到回应的，这一切都是值得的。是的，我本可以在许多时刻失去他，我也非常清楚失去他将如何彻底摧毁我，但与他在一起的快乐值得承受痛苦的可能性。与他分离确实痛苦，但这也让我们的重逢更加甜蜜。正如你可能记得的那样。”丹尼尔的身体温柔地笑了。“有时候害怕是正常的，明日香，但永远不要让那种恐惧阻止你追求真正的幸福。”

"But what if you're wrong?!" Asuka demanded, almost desperately. "What if you're wrong, and he rejects me?" 'Again...'
"但如果你错了呢？！"明日香几乎绝望地问道。"如果你错了，他拒绝了我怎么办？" '又一次...'

"But what if I'm right? What if it all goes incredibly, wonderfully right?" Rayana's voice asked, raising an eyebrow. "The Shinji of six months from now was quite obviously still with the you of that time point. Rather thoroughly, in fact. He's brave, kind, devoted to you...and he has a cute little butt. You could do much worse than to claim him as yours. You don't want him to get grabbed up by Wondergirl, do you?" Daniel's body smiled gently at Asuka. "Think on it, child. My husband is ready to return to his body now. Yes, dear, I'm done."
但如果我是对的呢？如果一切都非常非常顺利呢？" 雷亚娜的声音问道，挑起了一边的眉毛。"六个月后的真嗣显然还和你在一起。事实上，非常彻底。他勇敢、善良、对你忠诚……而且他有一个可爱的小屁股。你找不到比他更好的了。你不想他被那个神奇女孩抢走吧？" 丹尼尔的身体温柔地对明日香微笑。"想想吧，孩子。我的丈夫现在准备回到他的身体了。是的，亲爱的，我结束了。

Daniel's voice deepened again. "Hmm, I'd forgotten what he'd done to you. You have your own grievances against Commander Ikari. We may have to start a line for people to punch him."
丹尼尔的声音再次低沉下来。"嗯，我忘了他对你的所作所为。你也有自己的理由对碇司令不满。我们可能得排队去揍他了。"

"Now what are you talking about?" Asuka asked in exasperation.
"你现在又在说什么？" 明日香不耐烦地问道。

"My wife and Shinji have retrieved his mother's soul from Eva Unit-01, and after some discussion Shinji has decided that his father is worthy of rescue from the hole that he's still stuffed into. There's still the little matter of all the horrible things he did to you and your companions during the Angel War, like preventing Shinji or anyone else from helping you while Arael was attacking your mind. Shinji gets first shot, but I'm betting you'd like a chance to give him a good punch in a tender spot before we get him out of there."
我的妻子和真嗣已经从 Eva 初号机中取回了他的母亲的灵魂，经过一番讨论后，真嗣决定他的父亲值得被从那个他仍被困的地方救出。尽管他曾在天使战争中对你和你的同伴做了那么多可怕的事，比如在阿拉尔攻击你的心灵时阻止真嗣或其他人帮助你。真嗣有优先权，但我打赌你也会想在把他救出来之前给他一个温柔的地方来一拳。

Asuka cracked her knuckles. "Oh, I think I could see my way to letting him know how I feel about that, yes."
明日香活动了一下手指关节。"哦，我想我能让他知道我对那件事的感受，是的。"

"We'll catch up to them in time for that, then. We have another couple of stops before that once I get done with your mother. I think you'll like that. It will be a chance to do some good things for someone you like."
我们会及时追上他们的。在我处理完你母亲的事情后，我们还有几个地方要去。我想你会喜欢那里的。这将是一个为你喜欢的人做些好事的机会。

"Why are you going to force me to do things for the Third Child?"
你为什么要强迫我为第三适格者做事？

"Please take note that I didn't mention him. We're going to go do something to help out your former guardian, the one you were so fond of."
请注意，我没有提到他。我们打算去做点什么来帮助你以前的监护人，那个你非常喜欢的人。

"I was hardly fond of Misato."
我几乎不喜欢碇真嗣。

"Try again." 再试一次。

"Wait, we're going to help Kaji?" Asuka showed a little more enthusiasm for the prospect.
"等等，我们要去帮助加持先生吗？" 明日香对这个前景表现出了一丝兴奋。

"You're far from the only person in NERV with regrets in their past. Kaji had his own. His regrets are what gave him his fieron to seek the truth behind SEELE and the Second Impact. We can do something about those regrets to help him."
你并不是 NERV 中唯一一个对过去抱有遗憾的人。加持也有他自己的遗憾。正是这些遗憾给了他寻求 SEELE 和第二次冲击背后真相的决心。我们可以做些什么来帮助他弥补这些遗憾。

"You're going to bring him back too, aren't you? It wouldn't do a lot of good for...someone who's gone," Asuka ventured.
"你也会把他带回来的，对吧？对于一个已经离去的人来说，这并没有多大意义，" 明日香试探着说。

"I already did. Where do you think I went while I left you to talk to yourself when I first came to this tent?"
我已经这么做了。你以为我第一次来到这个帐篷时，把你留下来自言自语的时候去了哪里？

"If you already did, where is he?!" Asuka was practically bouncing.
"如果你已经做了，那他现在在哪里？！" 明日香几乎是在跳脚。

"Well, he was a bit dead, so I had to patch him up a bit. Then he was really dead, after Major Katsuragi ripped his head off for getting killed in the first place and making her cry. The two of them are resting back on Avalon, about two islands down from yours."
嗯，他当时有点死了，所以我得给他修补一下。然后他真的死了，因为葛城美里少校因为他一开始就死了而让她哭泣，所以把他的头扯了下来。他们俩现在安息在阿瓦隆，离你的岛大约两个岛屿远的地方。

"Her too?! Why didn't you say so earlier?!"
她也一样？！你怎么不早说？！

"I did mention I'd be giving you back everything that had been taken, didn't I? You should have thought of that. We're going to bring back everyone you miss," Daniel said with a smile. "Who do you think was at that party you and Shinji had to get back to in six months?"
我不是说过我会把你失去的一切都还给你吗？你应该想到这一点。我们会让你想念的每个人都回来，" 丹尼尔微笑着说，"你认为六个月后你和真嗣必须回去参加的那个派对上是谁？

Asuka looked back at her mother's face. "Everyone..." she said softly.
明日香回头看着她母亲的脸。"每个人……" 她轻声说道。

"I didn't tell you earlier since you were already pretty emotionally exhausted last night and didn't need any more twists piled on. But by this evening, you and Shinji are going to have a lot of catching up to do with people you had to say goodbye to before."
我之前没告诉你，是因为你昨晚已经很心力交瘁了，不需要再添波折。但到了今晚，你和真嗣将有很多与之前不得不告别的人要叙旧。

Daniel looked down at Kyoko Sohryu's face too. "To be honest, Asuka, I admit I did think about holding back on this or other things until you had cleared some of the tensions between you and Shinji. But I couldn't emotionally blackmail you like that. That kind of cruelty is just anathema to me, and worse, forcing you like that could even poison whatever bond you did form with him. I won't force you to talk to him, or even make it part of some price for your mother's return. But I will ask you to. You two are like Rayana and I in a way. Yin and Yang. Alone, you both are lonely, unbalanced, incomplete. But together you cover each other's gaps, and become so strong that Angels would fear you. I think that's part of why Shinji ultimately rejected Instrumentality, and left the door open for everyone else to leave it; because in a ego-borderless mass mind, you were all together, no one alone, but in the most horrible way possible. It's only as individuals... it's only because we are alone, that we can reach out to another... that we can love."
丹尼尔也低头看着京子·索拉鲁的脸。“说实话，明日香，我承认我确实想过在这件事或其他事情上有所保留，直到你和真嗣之间的一些紧张关系得到缓解。但我不能那样情感勒索你。那种残忍对我来说是极其反感的，更糟糕的是，那样强迫你甚至可能毒害你与他之间形成的任何纽带。我不会强迫你和他交谈，甚至不会将此作为你母亲回归的条件之一。但我希望你能这么做。你们俩就像我和拉亚娜一样。阴阳相生。独自一人时，你们都是孤独的、不平衡的、不完整的。但在一起，你们弥补了彼此的不足，变得如此强大，以至于天使都会畏惧你们。我认为这就是为什么真嗣最终拒绝了一体化，并为其他人离开它留下了机会；因为在没有自我界限的集体意识中，你们都在一起，没有人是孤独的，但这是最可怕的方式。只有作为个体...只有因为我们孤独，我们才能向另一个人伸出援手...我们才能去爱。”

Asuka sighed. "Alright, I'll think about it. I'm not promising anything."
明日香叹了口气。“好吧，我会考虑的。我不承诺任何事。”

"Thank you, Asuka. That's the most I can ask. You won't regret it. The other side is wonderful. Lieutenant Leibshott wasn't kidding. That's what we feel like all the time."
谢谢你，明日香。这是我所能要求的极限了。你不会后悔的。另一边真的很美好。莱布斯霍特中尉并没有开玩笑。我们一直都有这种感觉。

The golden light flowing out of his hands thinned and faded away. Daniel finally lowered his hands and took a deep breath. "Alright. Her soul is in one piece again."
从他手中流出的金色光芒逐渐变细并消失。丹尼尔终于放下双手，深吸了一口气。“好了。她的灵魂又完整了。”

Asuka gently took one of her mother's hands. "Mama? Can you hear me?" she asked hopefully.
明日香轻轻握住母亲的一只手。“妈妈？你能听见我吗？”她满怀希望地问道。

Kyoko's face did not stir.
绫波丽的脸庞没有丝毫动静。

"It won't be that quick, Asuka, I'm sorry. Her mind and soul took a lot of damage from the sundering. I've melded the pieces back together, but it will take a little more time before she'll be herself again. Think of it like this: I've just finished the surgery, and stitched her wound closed, but she's not going to hop out of bed right away. She's not instantly healed by the process, just begun. I'll be able to tell you more closely how long that will be when we get back to Avalon. We did this here because I didn't want the risks involved in taking her soul across a dimensional boundary when it was in pieces like that. But she'll heal faster and better on Avalon. We do share the name of 'that magical island who's healing never fails', after all. Let's go get her settled into a bed there."
不会那么快的，明日香，对不起。她的心灵和灵魂在分裂中受到了极大的伤害。我已经将碎片重新融合，但还需要一些时间她才能恢复如初。可以这样想：我刚完成手术，缝合了她的伤口，但她不会立刻下床活动。她并非瞬间痊愈，只是开始恢复。当我们回到阿瓦隆时，我将能更准确地告诉你需要多久。我们在这里进行是因为我不想在她灵魂破碎的状态下冒险穿越维度边界。但在阿瓦隆，她会更快更好地恢复。毕竟，我们共享着‘那个治愈永不失败的魔法岛屿’之名。让我们带她去那里安顿下来吧。

Asuka tried to contain her suddenly dashed hopes. "I see. Fine, let's take her there."
明日香试图抑制突然破灭的希望。"我明白了。好吧，我们带她去那里。"

The brilliant light of the portal flashed over them, and Asuka followed her mother's floating form through.
传送门的耀眼光芒笼罩着他们，明日香紧随其后，跟随母亲漂浮的身影穿越过去。

### Chapter 08 Souls, Old Friends, & Dark Places
灵魂、老友与黑暗之地

They placed Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu in the back bedroom of the beach house, just down the hall from the room Asuka had slept in the night before. A gesture from Daniel had swapped her filthy and torn street clothes with a plain white robe. The dirt on her hands and face were gone, and her hair now done up in a simple ponytail. Her chest rose and fell easily. She looked for all the world to be peacefully sleeping.
他们将绫波丽放置在海滨别墅的后面卧室里，就在昨晚明日香睡觉的房间的走廊对面。丹尼尔的一个手势便将她那破烂肮脏的街头服装换成了朴素的白色长袍。她手脸上的污垢消失了，头发也简单地束成了马尾。她的胸膛轻松地起伏着。她看起来就像是在安详地沉睡。

Asuka had pulled a chair close to the edge of the bed and watched as Daniel laid his hand on her forehead and closed his eyes. She felt her hair stand on end up the back of her neck. Daniel held his other hand out to her. "Take my hand for a moment, Asuka. You'll see what I meant earlier."
明日香拉了一把椅子靠近床边，看着丹尼尔将手放在她的额头上并闭上了眼睛。她感到后颈的头发竖了起来。丹尼尔向她伸出了另一只手。“握住我的手一会儿，明日香。你会明白我之前所说的。”

She reached up and took his hand. Suddenly she could see her mother far more than before. She blinked her eyes and tried to focus them on the strange new layer of sight she suddenly had. She could see her mother's... soul? There was now a thin image superimposed on her mother's body that was behind, above, and within her all at once. It looked like sheer fabric spun out of ultra-thin silvery thread, faintly rippling as she breathed. It was…Asuka couldn't even find words to frame its beauty, but it was utterly fascinating to look at. The smooth swoop of the material was marred by a livid ultraviolet scar running from her right shoulder to her left thigh. The edges of the scar were tightly pressed together, and she could see a nearly transparent film bridging the gap and sparkling slightly.
她伸手握住了他的手。突然间，她能比以往更清晰地看到母亲。她眨了眨眼，试图将视线聚焦在突然获得的新一层视觉上。她能看到母亲的...灵魂？现在，母亲的身体上叠加了一层薄薄的影像，它同时位于母亲身后、上方和体内。那看起来像是由极细的银色丝线织成的透明薄纱，随着呼吸微微波动。它是如此...明日香甚至找不到词语来形容它的美，但看着它令人着迷。那平滑的织物曲线被一道从右肩延伸至左大腿的紫外光疤痕所破坏。疤痕边缘紧贴着，她能看到一道几乎透明的薄膜连接着缝隙，并微微闪烁。

"That's the rip the Contact Experiment left in her soul. I've bound up the wound, and its healing fine. A week, give or take two days, and she'll wake naturally." Daniel's voice was... Asuka realized she wasn't hearing him. The voice was just in her head.
“那是接触实验在她灵魂上留下的裂痕。我已经包扎了伤口，它正在良好愈合。大约一周，或者多两天，她就会自然醒来。”丹尼尔的声音...明日香意识到自己并没有真的听到他的声音。那声音只是在她脑海中响起。

She turned her head to look at him. "What happened to staying out of my-"
她转过头看向他。“你不是说不会插手我的...”

It was like trying to stare at the sun. She could see in the center of the nearly blinding light a similar sheet overlaid on Daniel's form, but it was a deeper grey that seemed far away at the same time. No, it wasn't grey, it was gold at the edges, but the entire middle was made up of a chaotic web of criss-crossing, overlapping scar lines. A thread of silvery material ran out of the center of his darkness off into an infinite distance. Asuka yanked her hand out of Daniel's and her normal vision returned.
那感觉就像直视太阳一般。在几乎令人目眩的光芒中心，她能看到一张类似的光幕覆盖在丹尼尔的形体上，但那是一种更深沉的灰色，同时又似乎遥不可及。不，那不是灰色，边缘泛着金色，但整个中间部分是由纵横交错、重叠的疤痕线条构成的混乱网络。一根银色的丝线从他黑暗的中心延伸出去，消失在无尽的远方。明日香猛地从丹尼尔手中抽回自己的手，她的正常视觉随之恢复。

She shook her head to clear the strange visions out and looked up at him. "What was that?!"
她摇了摇头，试图驱散那些奇怪的幻象，抬头看向他。“那是什么？！”

"That was the wound in her soul. And if I'd thought you'd look away from her, I'd have warned you about me. I told you, my soul's not like a baseline human's anymore. Hasn't been for a very long time. And here on Avalon I'm at the seat of my power. I know it was hard on your eyes. Sorry about that."
“那是她灵魂上的伤口。如果我以为你会避开她，我就会警告你关于我的事。我告诉过你，我的灵魂已经不再像普通人类那样了。很久以前就不是了。而在阿瓦隆这里，我处于我的力量之巅。我知道那对你的眼睛来说很困难。对此我很抱歉。”

"What...why does yours look like that? All those scars?"
“为什么……为什么你的看起来那样？那些疤痕是怎么回事？”

"The light is what your mind tried to interpret apotheosis as. I'm very old. My soul is a lot deeper than your mother's. I am this entire cosmos and tied to every soul born in it. The scars...are older. Part of what drove me to seek godhood. I needed it to keep doing what I kept doing. The legacy of trying to do things that only a god should do."
那光芒是你心中试图解读为神化的东西。我非常古老。我的灵魂比你母亲的要深邃得多。我就是这整个宇宙，与其中诞生的每一个灵魂紧密相连。那些伤痕……更为久远。它们驱使我追求神性。我需要它来继续我一直在做的事情。试图做只有神才能做的事，这是我的遗产。

"Creating your own universe?" Asuka guessed.
"创造你自己的宇宙？" 明日香猜测道。

Daniel shook his head, his hand still on Kyoko's forehead. "Making a cosmos is comparatively easy. Only a god can create a new soul ex nihilo, from nothing. But I kept running into places and people that needed them. There is...a way to create a new soul without being a god, but it's not easy, and it has costs, but sometimes I decided that the cost was worth it. A wounded soul properly cared for heals. It can even grow back from being ripped in half. You can give someone a soul...if you're willing to give them half of one to start from. Before I ascended, I must have done that...dozens of times, scores."
丹尼尔摇了摇头，手依旧放在恭子的额头上。"创造一个宇宙相比之下还算容易。只有神能从无中创造新的灵魂。但我不断遇到需要它们的地方和人。有一种方法可以在不成为神的情况下创造新灵魂，但这并不容易，且有代价，但有时我决定这代价是值得的。一个受伤的灵魂得到妥善照顾就能愈合。它甚至能从被撕裂的状态中恢复过来。你可以给予某人一个灵魂……如果你愿意从半个灵魂开始。在我升格之前，我一定这么做过……几十次，甚至更多。"

Asuka's eyes widened. She looked at her mother. Having her soul ripped in two had driven her mother mad to the point of suicide. Instrumentality and re-embodiment had felt like putting her own through a wringer. He'd done this repeatedly? Willingly? To himself? Just what had that felt like? "And that leaves scars?"
明日香的眼睛睁大了。她看着她的母亲。灵魂被撕裂成两半的经历已将她的母亲逼至疯狂，甚至企图自杀。融合与再实体化的过程就像将自己的灵魂拧干一样。他竟反复这样做？心甘情愿？对自己？那究竟是怎样的感受？“那会留下伤痕吗？”

Daniel removed his hand from her mother's forehead and straightened up. "That does. Some are from other things that I faced in years gone by. In my younger days, I had failures, mistakes. Sometimes it cost many lives, in times and places I could not rescue them. You know well yourself how some things can wound your soul." He looked over at her. "That's what I see when I look at you. I can't look at you or Shinji and not see the wounds you bear. And I can't leave you to bear them alone when I can help. That's another reason why I'm doing this."
丹尼尔从她母亲的额头上移开手，直起身来。“确实会。有些伤痕来自我早年面对的其他事情。年轻时，我有过失败，犯过错误。有时这导致了许多生命的损失，在那些时刻和地点，我无法拯救他们。你自己也很清楚，有些事情能深深伤害你的灵魂。”他看向她。“这就是我看到你时的感受。我无法看着你或真嗣而不看到你们所承受的创伤。我不能在能帮助你们的时候，让你们独自承受这些。这也是我这么做的原因之一。”

"What do I look like?" Asuka asked quietly.
“我看起来是什么样子？”明日香轻声问道。

"Worn. Tattered. Tired. You have a number of visible wounds. I'm bandaging them as I can. Rescuing your mother is one way, destroying the Dummy Plugs and preventing your rapes another. That's also why I asked you to give Shinji a chance. You both have a big hole in your souls thanks to the loss of your mothers at such a young age. Your holes match up. The wounds are symmetrical, opposite, and complimentary. You'd literally complement each other, covering each other's gaps and filling the ache."
破旧。褴褛。疲惫。你身上有许多明显的伤口。我正尽力为你包扎。救出你的母亲是一种方式，摧毁 Dummy Plugs 并阻止你的侵犯是另一种。这也是为什么我让你给真嗣一个机会。你们俩因为年幼时失去母亲而在灵魂上留下了巨大的空洞。你们的伤口是对称的，相反的，也是互补的。你们会真正地互补，互相填补对方的空缺，缓解彼此的痛苦。

Asuka looked back to her mother. "Having her back won't do the same? Fill the hole losing her gave me?"
明日香回头看向她的母亲。“让她回来不会同样填补失去她给我的空洞吗？”

"The wound shaped a lot of who you are. Like bending a tree early in its growth, it affected a lot of the ways you grew over the years. Having your mother back will heal a lot of the wounds, but she won't fill the gaps entirely. It won't be the same. She'll love you because you're her daughter, not because she needs you. Not the way a true partner would."
这个伤口很大程度上塑造了你的性格。就像在树苗早期生长时弯曲它一样，它影响了你多年来成长的许多方式。让你的母亲回来会治愈很多伤口，但她不会完全填补那些空缺。那不会是一样的。她会爱你，因为你是她的女儿，而不是因为她需要你。不是像真正的伴侣那样。

He stood up and walked to the door. Asuka stayed in the chair, watching her mother sleep.
他站起来走向门口。明日香留在椅子上，看着她的母亲睡觉。

"Asuka?" 明日香？

"I don't want to leave her. I just got her back."
我不想离开她。我刚把她找回来。

Daniel stepped back and put his hand on her shoulder. "The house systems will keep her fed and comfortable, Asuka. Sitting here and staring won't heal her faster. You'll see her every night until she wakes, and I promise you'll be here when she does. Seven days. Come, there's good works to do and friends to rescue."
丹尼尔后退一步，将手放在她的肩上。“家里的系统会照顾好她，让她吃得饱穿得暖，明日香。坐在这里盯着她看也不会让她更快康复。你每晚都能见到她，直到她醒来，我保证你会在她醒来时在场。七天。来吧，还有很多好事要做，还有朋友需要救助。”

"I can't leave her alone..."
我不能把她一个人留下……

"And she won't be. Sean?" Daniel addressed the empty air.
"而她不会的。肖恩？" 丹尼尔对着空无一人的空气说道。

The empty air answered. "Yes, Sire?"
空无一人的空气回应道："是的，陛下？"

"A priestess of your mother's to watch over our healing guest, if you please."
如果您愿意，请派您母亲的一位女祭司来照看我们这位正在康复的客人。

"Aye, Sire." 遵命，陛下。

(I) . . j p g
(我) . . j p g

Seconds later, a soft rapping on the doorframe heralded the entrance of a slight woman in a white robe with blue and gold edging. She bobbed a smooth bow. "Good morning, my Lord, Miss Sohryu. I am Mother Sriyana D'Ganreth-Hawes, priestess of the Lady Mother. It will be my pleasure to watch over your mother, Miss." Her German had no accent, of course.
片刻之后，门框上传来轻柔的敲击声，预示着一位身着白袍、饰有蓝金边饰的纤细女子步入房间。她优雅地鞠了一躬，说道：“早上好，大人，苏瑞尤小姐。我是斯里亚娜·D·甘瑞斯-霍斯修女，女神母亲的祭司。很荣幸能照顾您的母亲，小姐。”她的德语当然没有任何口音。

Asuka stopped herself from staring. The woman had light blue hair like a certain fellow pilot once had, tied into a long braid, and distinctly pointed ears. The thin sword at her side was less strange than her almost elven ears. 'Oh well, at least she doesn't have red eyes,' Asuka thought. "Are you a doctor?"
明日香克制住自己不要盯着看。这位女士有着浅蓝色的头发，像某位曾经的同僚飞行员一样，扎成一条长辫子，耳朵明显尖尖的。她腰间的细剑比起她那近乎精灵般的耳朵来说，还不算太奇怪。'哦，好吧，至少她没有红眼睛，'明日香心想。"您是医生吗？"

The woman gently tapped the elaborate triple moon pendant on her chest. "No, Miss. I am a Donna, a 'Mother' in your tongue, a senior priestess of the Lady. I have medical skills, but my main calling is magical and spiritual healing, much more needed than medical matters for this sort of injury. Through me the Lady will watch over her as well. And in any mundane emergency, I can jump us to the clinic island in moments."
女子轻轻敲了敲胸前精美的三重月亮吊坠，回答道：“不，小姐。我是多娜，用您的话说就是‘母亲’，是女神的高级祭司。我具备医疗技能，但我的主要职责是魔法和精神上的治愈，对于这种伤势来说，这比医疗事务更需要。通过我，女神也会看顾她。而在任何世俗紧急情况下，我都能瞬间带我们前往诊所岛。”

Asuka still hesitated. She had only minutes of memories of being with her mother. Most of them half-forgotten remnants from when she was very young, and the rest the glorious, chaotic blur of her mother being there with her in the fight with the Mass Production Evas. Less than a minute of watching her be beaten in the video of her 'trial'. Minutes against sixteen years of loss. The few minutes she'd had her watching her sleep made up a not inconsiderable part of the total now. The last thing she wanted to do right now was leave her side.
明日香仍然犹豫不决。她只有几分钟与母亲在一起的记忆。其中大部分是她很小的时候半遗忘的片段，其余则是与量产型 Eva 战斗时母亲陪伴在身边的辉煌而混乱的模糊记忆。在她的“审判”视频中，看着母亲被打败的时间不到一分钟。几分钟的记忆与十六年的失去相比。如今，她看着母亲睡觉的那几分钟构成了其中不可忽视的一部分。此刻，她最不想做的就是离开母亲的身边。

"She needs time to heal, Asuka. As do you. What I've got planned for next will help you and people you would like to call friends. Your mother will be safe and well cared for here. Trust me." Daniel gave a gentle tug on her shoulder. She rose reluctantly.
“她需要时间来恢复，明日香。你也一样。我接下来计划的事情将有助于你和你愿意称之为朋友的人。你的母亲在这里会很安全，得到很好的照顾。相信我。”丹尼尔轻轻地拉了拉她的肩膀。她不情愿地站了起来。

She felt a cool metallic surface brush against her left wrist. She looked down to see Daniel sliding a smooth silver band onto her arm that looked like the matching ones on his and Lieutenant Leibshott's wrists. "What?"
她感觉到一个冰冷的金属表面轻触她的左手腕。她低头一看，只见丹尼尔正将一个光滑的银色手环滑到她的手臂上，看起来与他自己和莱布施托特中尉手腕上的手环相匹配。“什么？”

"This is an interface band. I've set it to voice commands for now. Think combination cell phone, watch, computer, everything you might need. Just tell it what you need. See this little green square in the corner? Touch that, and it will bring up a live 3D feed of this room and your mother's vital signs. You can check on her at any time, or call us, whatever you want." Daniel gave her a kind look. "I know you want to sit here until she wakes, but there is more to do, child. You're not the only one who needs help. Ready to be a part of it?"
这是一个多功能界面带。我目前将其设置为语音指令模式。它集手机、手表、电脑等功能于一身，满足你所需的一切。只需告诉它你需要什么。看到角落里那个小绿方块了吗？轻触它，就能调出这个房间的实时 3D 影像和你母亲的体征数据。你可以随时查看她的情况，或者联系我们，随你所愿。" Daniel 向她投去一个温和的眼神，"我知道你想一直坐在这里等她醒来，但还有更多事情要做，孩子。需要帮助的不止你一个。准备好参与进来了吗？

Asuka rubbed the band and stared at her mother again. Others, huh? 'Kaji. Misato. Hikari. Shin- damn it.' "Alright."
明日香摩挲着带子，再次凝视母亲。其他人，是吗？'加持、美里、光、真嗣——该死。' "好吧。"

"Let's go see something that might give you a bit more energy to get motivated." He walked through the door and down the hall. Asuka gave her mother one more look, and followed him.
"我们去看看能让你更有动力的东西。" 他穿过门，沿着走廊走去。明日香又看了母亲一眼，然后跟了上去。

She caught up to him standing on the path just outside the beach house. "So now what?" she asked.
她赶上他时，他正站在海滩屋外的小径上。"那现在怎么办？" 她问道。

"Scenic route, or quick jump?" he replied.
"风景路线，还是快速跳跃？"他回答道。

"Ah... scenic route?" she guessed.
"啊...风景路线吗？"她猜测道。

"As you wish." They shot into the air. Asuka bit down on a shriek. 'I've fought Angels and monsters with a snarl on my lips.' Shooting through the air with no visible means of support was not going to-... to... boy the ground looked far away. And now it was rapidly getting much closer. 'Ok, maybe a little shrieking was in order.'
"如你所愿。"他们一跃而起。明日香紧咬牙关，差点尖叫出来。'我曾与天使和怪兽战斗，嘴角挂着冷笑。'在空中疾驰，却无明显支撑，这可不妙...地面看起来好遥远。而现在，它正迅速逼近。'好吧，或许尖叫一下也无妨。'

Asuka opened her mouth to start, when the ground finished rushing up at them and they were suddenly standing perfectly still again. Not even a bump. She looked around, but there was no one around but her and Daniel. A similar looking beach house to hers stood in front of them. She turned to Daniel to vent some of her alarm. "Next time you need to warn me when the 'scenic route' involves me possibly having a heart attack!"
明日香正要开口，地面却已迎面扑来，转眼间他们又稳稳地站住了，连一丝颠簸都没有。她环顾四周，除了她和丹尼尔，别无他人。眼前是一座与她家相似的海滨别墅。她转向丹尼尔，试图发泄心中的惊慌："下次你所谓的'风景路线'可能会让我心脏病发作，你得提前告诉我！"

"And you need to put your genius IQ to work. You know I'm a god and this is my domain. I'm not going to allow any harm to come to you here. A supernova could go off in your face, and you wouldn't be so much as sunburned. Around here, Death works for me," Daniel retorted. "You're just upset because what your hindbrain knows hasn't quite caught up withwhat your mind has learned. Now, watch quietly." He pointed at the door to the cabin facing the patio.
"你需要运用你那高智商的头脑。你知道我是神，这里是我的领域。我不会允许任何伤害降临到你身上。即使超新星在你面前爆炸，你也不会被晒伤。在这里，死神为我工作，"丹尼尔反驳道。"你只是因为你的本能还未完全跟上你心智所学到的知识而感到不安。现在，安静地看着吧。"他指向面对露台的小屋的门。

A second after Asuka focused on the door, it swung open. Two people she knew were dead came out.
阿苏卡刚一集中注意力在门上，门就打开了。两个她以为已经死去的人走了出来。

And moments after the shock of seeing Kaji and Misato alive and well had registered, Asuka got another one. The beer bottles in their hands were no surprise. The fact their other hands were tightly clasped was. As was the prominent sparkle on Misato's left. 'No...No way. He couldn't...'
在震惊于看到卡吉和美里安然无恙之后不久，阿苏卡又受到了一次冲击。他们手中的啤酒瓶并不令人惊讶。令人惊讶的是，他们的另一只手紧紧相握，以及美里左手上那枚显眼的戒指。'不...不可能。他不会...'

"Major Katsuragi was rather upset with him when I picked them up, for going off on his little suicide mission in pursuit of 'the truth' and getting killed. She calmed down when he kept his promise last night."
当我接他们时，葛城少校对他在追求'真相'的小小自杀任务中丧生感到非常生气。但昨晚他遵守了承诺，她也就平静下来了。

"What promise?" Asuka asked hollowly. Her teenage crush was walking along holding someone else's hand, and she was wearing a ring. Now she had nobody.
"什么承诺？" 明日香空洞地问道。她的青春期暗恋对象正牵着别人的手走着，而她手上戴着戒指。现在她一无所有。

"Before he left on that last mission he left a message on the answering machine at the apartment. He promised Major Katsuragi that if he saw her again, he'd say the words he couldn't say eight years before, when they broke up in college. After she was done beating him silly for dying and making her cry, she held him to that promise. He did."
在他执行最后一次任务前，他在公寓的答录机上留下了一条信息。他向葛城少校承诺，如果再次见到她，他会说出八年前他们在大学分手时未能说出的话。在她因他死去而哭泣并狠狠地揍了他一顿之后，她坚持要他履行那个承诺。他做到了。

"How nice for her," Asuka spat.
"她真幸运，" 明日香嘲讽道。

Daniel faced her. "You didn't 'lose' him, Asuka. He was never yours to have. You knew that perfectly well the night they came home from that wedding together. He and Major Katsuragi had a bond before you ever met either of them. They were both just afraid of making that last step to really connect to each other. So they both buried themselves in their work to try and find meaning in living alone. It got him killed and turned her into an alcoholic mess. That's how she coped. She drank to keep the feelings away. Death has a way of making you reassess your priorities, so they had a long talk. Now they've both said a few things they were afraid to before." Daniel spoke kindly, but Asuka tried not to listen.
丹尼尔面对着她。“你并没有‘失去’他，明日香。他从来就不属于你。你很清楚，那天晚上他们从婚礼回来时，他和葛城少校之间就已经有了羁绊。在你遇到他们之前，他们就已经如此。他们都害怕迈出那最后一步，真正地彼此连接。因此，他们都埋头于工作，试图在孤独的生活中寻找意义。这导致了他丧命，而她则变成了酗酒的烂摊子。那就是她应对的方式。她喝酒是为了逃避那些感觉。死亡有一种方式让你重新评估你的优先事项，所以他们进行了一次长谈。现在，他们都说了一些之前害怕说出口的话。”丹尼尔温和地说，但明日香尽量不去听。

He paused. "You coped by being angry at the world, and driving yourself to be the best so people would have to pay attention to you. You said yourself that wasn't the healthiest way to live. Drinking a case of beer every other day wasn't either. And look on the bright side; yesterday morning you knew he was dead. Now you've got him back in the land of the living. He still thinks the world of you, and will be your friend. And so will she."
他停顿了一下。“你应对的方式是向世界发怒，逼迫自己成为最优秀的人，这样人们就不得不关注你。你自己也说过，这不是最健康的生活方式。每隔一天喝一箱啤酒也不是。但往好处看；昨天早上你知道他已经死了。现在你又让他回到了活人的世界。他仍然非常看重你，并且会继续做你的朋友。她也会。”

"Can we go now?" She turned away. "I really don't want to see any more."
我们现在可以走了吗？"她转过身去，"我真的不想再看下去了。

"Where would you like to go?"
你想去哪里？

"I don't care. Away from here. You dragged me away from Ma- my mother for this?"
我无所谓，只要离开这里。你把我从妈妈身边拖走就是为了这个？

"Kaji was one of the few people to treat you as more than just a precocious child. He was handsome, charming, paid attention to you, and took you more seriously than anyone else around you. So you liked him, a lot. But he was never for you. You still like him?"
卡吉是少数几个不把你仅仅当作早熟孩子的人之一。他英俊、迷人，关注你，并且比周围任何人都更认真地对待你。所以你很喜欢他，非常喜欢。但他从来不属于你。你现在还喜欢他吗？

Asuka was silent for a long minute. "Yes, damn me. I've got few enough happy memories of people in my past. He's still the best man I ever knew."
明日香沉默了许久。“是的，该死，我过去的人生中快乐的回忆本就不多。他依然是我认识的最好的人。”

"And Misato was the closest thing you had to a mom in the last decade. You want to go pick up some engagement presents for them?"
“而美里是你过去十年里最接近母亲的存在。你想去给他们挑些订婚礼物吗？”

"I suppose." 'Anything to get away from here. I know I'll have to deal with this later, but right now I don't care. Fuck, he's been dead for four years to me. I've known that long I'd never have him. I shouldn't let this get to me so much.'
“我想是的。”'只要能离开这里就好。我知道迟早要面对这一切，但现在我不在乎。该死，他已经去世四年了。我早就知道我永远得不到他。我不该让这件事如此影响我。'

"I said we'd get to do something good for your friends. And you might get to shoot at some more bad people." Another pitch black portal opened in front of them. "Back to your world we go. We're going to have to go a bit further back for these gifts."
“我说过我们会为你的朋友们做些好事。而且你也许还能再对付一些坏人。”又一个漆黑的传送门在他们面前打开。“我们这就返回你的世界。为了这些礼物，我们得稍微回溯一些时间。”

"What are we going shopping for? There's not exactly a thriving economy on my world to pick from. The pre-Impact video games the Third digs up for me are about the best you'll find."
我们去购物要买什么？我的世界里可没有繁荣的经济可供选择。第三为我挖掘的那些前冲击时代的电子游戏，算是你能找到的最好的东西了。

"We're going hunting for the only true source of wealth, Asuka. Things beyond price."
我们正要去追寻真正的财富，飞鸟。那些无价之宝。

"Somehow I doubt you're taking us to rob a bank or seize a diamond mine, so what are we after?"
我怀疑你并不是要带我们去抢劫银行或夺取钻石矿，那我们到底要找什么？

"Friends and family, my child, friends and family." They stepped through the portal back into the tent.
"朋友和家人，我的孩子，朋友和家人。"他们穿过传送门回到了帐篷里。

"...if I call that trite and sappy, you're going to point out what we just did for me, aren't you?"
...如果我说这很俗套又煽情，你会指出我们刚刚为我所做的事情，对吧？

"I knew you were a genius. Let's go shopping." The portal closed as silently as it had opened. They missed Misato blindfolding Kaji with her bikini top and playing Marco-Polo with the beer she stole from his hand. Things proceeded from there.
"我知道你是天才。我们去购物吧。" 传送门悄无声息地关闭了，就像它开启时一样。他们错过了美里用比基尼上衣蒙住加持眼睛，并从他手中偷走啤酒玩马可波罗的一幕。事情就这样继续发展下去。

There was no light in the cell. No light reached this far underground. There usually wasn't any light at all, unless the guards had one of their infrequent needs to come down the hall to slide his meal tray through the slot in the door, or much less often, open it to let him hand out his honey bucket. They never opened it to take him out of the cell. Not in the more than a year since he'd entered it. Not that he'd have been able to see much if there was light. The cell was little more than a hollow concrete cube with a few ratty blankets in a corner, and his glasses were long gone anyhow.
牢房里没有光。地底深处，光线无法到达。通常这里完全没有光，除非守卫偶尔需要下来走廊，通过门上的槽口滑进他的餐盘，或者更少见地，打开门让他交出便桶。他们从未打开门将他带出牢房。自从他进入这里以来，已经超过一年了。即使有光，他也看不见多少东西。牢房不过是一个空心的混凝土立方体，角落里有几条破旧的毯子，而且他的眼镜也早已不见了。

So when the cell was flooded with a sudden sparkle of starlight through the window in the cell's door, it was nearly as if someone had turned on full daylight to the man who'd once been known as Commander Gendo Ikari née Rokubungi, Supreme Commander of the UN agency called NERV. He threw his hand up in front of his eyes and tried to sit up straighter. He did not exclaim his surprise, or ask questions. He'd never been a man given to much talk in any case, and a year of solitary captivity after three years of wandering a world left after all his most desperate, detailed plans had failed to give him back the one thing that made him a tolerable human being had left him with little urge to talk to anyone at all. He was beyond all desire anymore. He simply waited to see what would happen. He did not expect what he got.
当星光突然透过牢房门上的窗户洒满整个空间时，对于曾被称为源堂元帅、联合国机构 NERV 最高指挥官的源堂元帅（原名六分仪源堂）来说，几乎如同有人将白昼的强光全然打开。他举起手遮挡在眼前，试图坐得更直一些。他没有惊呼，也没有提问。无论如何，他向来不是多言之人，而在他那些最绝望、详尽的计划都未能让他重新获得那个使他成为可容忍之人的东西后，三年的流浪与一年的单独监禁生活已让他几乎不想与任何人交谈。他已超越了所有欲望。他只是静静等待，看接下来会发生什么。他并未预料到即将发生的事情。

The lock screeched, and the door of the cell swung open to let a beautiful red haired woman in elaborate green and black robes step into the cell. She was definitely not one of Winthrop's black-uniformed prison guards. She planted her fists on her hips as she stood over him. She regarded him with a look of cold contempt like one he might have given his son in days long past. "Ikari Gendo?" the stranger addressed him icily.
锁链嘎吱作响，牢门打开，一位美丽的红发女子身着华丽的绿黑相间长袍步入牢房。她显然不是温斯洛监狱那些身着黑制服的狱警之一。她双手叉腰站在他面前，用一种冷酷轻蔑的眼神打量着他，就像他很久以前可能对他的儿子投去的目光一样。“碇源堂？”这位陌生人冷冰冰地称呼他。

He managed to twitch his head in a nod, then realized that it might be invisible in the dim cell. "Yes?" he croaked hoarsely.
他勉强点了点头，随即意识到在这昏暗的牢房里可能看不清楚。“是的？”他嘶哑地回应。

"Get up. It's time for your parole hearing," the woman said flatly in perfect Japanese. "And keeping the board waiting won't do you any favors."
“站起来。是时候参加你的假释听证会了，”女子用流利的日语平淡地说道，“让委员会等待对你没有任何好处。”

Gendo struggled to his feet. A parole hearing? That did not sound like something he would be given in Winthrop's prison. This had to be something else. He may have given up on all his worldly desires, but his wits had not left him. He had little energy or impulse to worry; if Winthrop wanted him dead, he didn't need to indulge in any more charades to accomplish that. So whatever this woman meant, it would not be one of Winthrop's plans. That alone made it worth investigating.
碇源堂挣扎着站起身。假释听证会？这听起来不像是在温斯洛监狱会给予他的待遇。这必定是别有用心。尽管他已经放弃了所有的世俗欲望，但他的智慧并未离他而去。他几乎没有精力或冲动去担忧；如果温斯洛想要他死，根本无需再上演任何把戏来达成目的。因此，无论这位女子意欲何为，都不会是温斯洛的计划。仅此一点，就值得探究一番。

The woman turned and walked out of the cell. Gendo blinked. His eyesight was not at its best after such prolonged darkness and lack of glasses, but it looked like the woman had walked through the door and right outdoors. He could see the scattered pinpoints of light of a night sky out the cell door. He knew perfectly well it should be a blank concrete hallway leading to his right. He shrugged slightly, and followed.
女人转身走出了牢房。源堂眨了眨眼。长时间处于黑暗中且没有眼镜，他的视力并不理想，但看起来女人穿过了门，直接走到了户外。他能看到牢房门外夜空中散布的点点星光。他非常清楚，那里本应是一条通往右侧的空白混凝土走廊。他微微耸肩，跟了上去。

And fell off the world.
然后就从世界上消失了。

He stepped out into space, nothing apparent below his feet but stars. His brief scream of alarm at finding himself stepping out into the infinite abyss of empty space was cut short by a lifetime of iron self-control. Those years were not enough to prevent his jaw from dropping as he squinted his eyes at the young man in front of him. He looked like... "Shinji?" he asked in confusion.
他迈步踏入虚空，脚下除了星星什么也没有。发现自己踏入无尽虚空的瞬间，他本能地发出一声惊恐的尖叫，但多年的钢铁般自制力立刻将其打断。尽管如此，他的下巴还是不由自主地掉了下来，当他眯起眼睛看着面前的年轻人时。他看起来像是...“真嗣？”他困惑地问道。

The young man who looked like his son stepped closer and stared at him for a few seconds. Then he curled his arm back and whipped it forward in a sharp jab at Gendo's face. Reflexes the legacy of years spent brawling as a younger man tried to bring his arms up to protect his face, but he found his arms lightly but irresistibly held from behind his back by the cold faced woman. Additional stars exploded in his head as the fist impacted on his nose.
那个看起来像他儿子的年轻人走近了几步，盯着他看了几秒钟。随后，他弯曲手臂，猛地向前一击，直击源堂的脸部。多年街头斗殴留下的本能反应试图让他的手臂抬起保护脸部，但他发现自己的双臂被身后那位面无表情的女子轻柔却不可抗拒地束缚住了。随着拳头击中他的鼻子，他的脑海中仿佛又炸开了更多的星星。

The woman's grip released him as soon as he was hit, and he crumpled to his knees. If that was his son, he'd gotten a lot better at throwing a punch since he last saw him. His nose felt like it was quite possibly broken. Again.
女子一击中他，便立刻松开了手，他随即跪倒在地。如果那真是他的儿子，那么自从上次见面以来，他的拳击技巧显然大有长进。他的鼻子感觉很可能又被打断了。

"Hmm, we can't have you squinting like Mister Magoo at everyone. Hold still," the strange woman said behind him. He felt her hand grab his chin and yank it to stare straight up at her face above him. She jabbed her two fingers into his eyes simultaneously, and not very gently. But once he stopped blinking away the pain of that assault, he found his vision clear and sharp as a teenager's again. He refocused on the young man in front of him, who was glaring down at him, his right hand clenching over and over like he was deciding whether to take another swing at him. It was Shinji. He finally noticed the tall, slender woman standing a short distance behind his son.
"嗯，我们不能让你像马古先生那样眯着眼睛看人。别动，"那位陌生女子在他身后说道。他感觉到她的手抓住他的下巴，用力将他的脸转向她，迫使他直视她高悬在他上方的脸。她用两根手指同时戳进他的眼睛，动作并不温柔。但当他停止因疼痛而眨眼后，他发现自己的视力变得清晰锐利，如同少年时期。他重新聚焦在面前的年轻人身上，那人正怒视着他，右手不断握紧，似乎在考虑是否要再次挥拳。那是真嗣。他终于注意到他儿子身后不远处站着的那个高挑苗条的女人。

His heart stopped. It was not possible. She was not possible…
他的心跳停止了。这不可能。她不可能出现……

"Y... Yui?" He could barely find the breath to talk. He couldn't move. He couldn't blink, or she might vanish. He struggled to his feet again, and took the first step towards her. His eyes and all his attention locked on her-
"Y... Yui？"他几乎找不到说话的气息。他动弹不得。他不敢眨眼，生怕她会消失。他挣扎着站起来，迈出了向她靠近的第一步。他的目光和全部注意力都锁定在她身上——

And thus his surprise was great when an angry German-American girl slammed him in the temple with the grip of a borrowed .45. Great, but brief. He dropped to the invisible floor, unconscious.
因此，当一个愤怒的德裔美国女孩用借来的.45 手枪的握把猛击他的太阳穴时，他的惊讶是巨大的。但这种惊讶转瞬即逝。他倒在了看不见的地板上，失去了意识。

The redheaded girl with the pistol smiled in satisfaction. "Verfluchter arschloch." She gave him a hard kick to the ribs and looked up from Gendo Ikari's limp form. She smirked at Shinji. "Hey, Third. I guess you found your mom. Wait until you hear what I've been up to." Asuka giggled. "I've been shopping!"
那个红发女孩手持手枪，满意地笑了。"该死的混蛋。"她狠狠地踢了他的肋骨一脚，然后从源堂元渡瘫软的身体上抬起头来。她对真嗣咧嘴一笑："嘿，第三。我猜你找到了你妈妈。等着听我最近在忙什么吧。"明日香咯咯笑道："我一直在购物！"

Part 15 第 15 部分
Lunch and Ideas 午餐与想法

Rayana's arm checked Yui's rush to Gendo's side before it could get going. "I told you your husband had a lot of sins to answer for, Doctor. Meet one of the other victims of his Scenario: Asuka Langley Sohryu, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-02. Asuka, child, I'd appreciate it if you could keep any further beatings of Commander Ikari on hold until we can convince Dr. Ikari not to try tackling you."
雷亚娜的手臂及时阻止了唯冲向元渡身边的动作。"我告诉过你，你的丈夫有很多罪孽要偿还，博士。见见他计划中的另一位受害者：惣流·明日香·兰格雷，二号机驾驶员。明日香，孩子，如果你能暂时停止对元渡指挥官的进一步打击，直到我们能说服唯博士不要试图攻击你，我将不胜感激。"

Asuka humphed. "Fine. I reserve the right to kick him in the balls a few times later, though."
明日香哼了一声。"好吧。但我保留稍后踢他几脚的权利。"

Shinji stared at the redhead with the gun in surprise. Daniel was right behind her. They hadn't been there when Rayana had opened the portal to his father's cell. They must have come in when his attention was focused on his father. Admittedly, Shinji had been rather intensely zeroed in on him stumbling out of the dank hole he's been drawn from. He looked down as his father. A small puddle of blood was forming under his head. If his nose hadn't been broken from Shinji's punch, it sure was now after Gendo had landed flat on his face. Shinji found it hard to care.
真嗣惊讶地盯着那个拿着枪的红发女孩，丹尼尔就在她身后。在雷亚娜打开通往他父亲牢房的传送门时，他们并不在那里。他们一定是在他全神贯注于父亲蹒跚走出潮湿洞穴时进来的。诚然，真嗣当时非常专注地盯着他父亲从那肮脏的洞穴中蹒跚而出。他低头看着父亲，一小滩血正在他头下形成。如果他的鼻子没有被真嗣的拳头打断，那么在源渡脸朝下摔倒后，现在肯定断了。真嗣发现自己很难在意这一点。

He looked back up at Asuka. She was wearing a huge smirk and twirling the .45, her other hand cocked on her left hip. 'Sweet gods, she looks hot. Even hotter than back on Over The Rainbow. She's even wearing a yellow dress like back then. Wait, what the Hell did I just think? Oh, crap, say something, you've been standing here like a dummy.' "Um, hi Asuka. Yeah, I did. 'Oh, real smooth, Ikari. At least you haven't dropped your pants like Touji.' Which right now would have been really bad; that medical treatment this morning had rejuvenated a lot of things, at least one of which was very happy to see the Second Child. 'Good thing it's kind of dark here in space. I think she'd kill me, and this time she has a gun.'
他抬头再次望向明日香。她脸上挂着大大的坏笑，手里转着那把.45 手枪，另一只手叉在左腰上。'天啊，她看起来真性感。甚至比在《彩虹之上》时还要火辣。她还穿着和那时一样的黄色裙子。等等，我刚在想什么鬼东西？哦，糟糕，说点什么吧，你已经像个傻瓜一样站在这里了。' "呃，嗨，明日香。是的，我确实这么想。'哦，真会说话，碇。至少你没有像东治那样脱裤子。'现在这么做可就糟透了；今天早上的医疗处理让很多东西恢复了活力，至少有一件东西见到第二适格者非常兴奋。'幸好太空里光线有点暗。我觉得她会杀了我，这次她手里还有枪。'

"Sharp and witty conversation as always, Third." Asuka finally holstered the pistol and got out of the way for Yui to drop to her knees at Gendo's side. She flatly returned Yui's hostile glare. Yui suddenly broke the staring contest off when Gendo began to rise, still face down. Yui stood up in confusion as Gendo floated to waist height and started to drift towards Daniel and Rayana.
"一如既往地尖锐机智，第三适格者。" 明日香终于收起了手枪，给绫波让路，让她跪在元渡身边。她冷冷地回应了绫波充满敌意的瞪视。当元渡开始起身，仍然面朝下时，绫波突然停止了对视。绫波困惑地站起来，元渡浮起到腰际高度，开始向丹尼尔和蕾雅娜漂去。

"And now I get to say 'hello' in the flesh, Dr. Ikari. Let's get you and your husband somewhere you can have a nice long talk alone. Please don't be too upset with Pilot Sohryu for knocking him cold. I did talk her out of just kneecapping him. He's got a lot to answer for. Once you hear the full story, you may be rather upset with him too," Daniel said. A bright gold portal opened next to him. "And this has been a rather busy morning, I think. Time for lunch."
现在我终于能当面说声'你好'了，碇博士。让我们找个地方，让你和你的丈夫好好单独谈谈。请不要对飞行员惣流因为把他打昏而太过生气。我确实劝她不要只是打断他的腿。他有很多事情需要解释。一旦你听完整个故事，你也许也会对他感到相当生气。" 丹尼尔说道。一个明亮的金色传送门在他旁边打开。"今天上午真是忙碌，我想是时候吃午饭了。

Asuka turned away from Shinji and called back over her shoulder at him. "C'mon, Third. I've had a wild day already, and I'm hungry."
明日香转过身去，背对着真嗣，回头对他喊道：“快点，第三适格者。我今天已经够疯狂了，现在饿了。”

Shinji shook himself out of his paralysis, and hastily tried to re-arrange his pants as he brought up the rear. He'd flown through half the solar system, drawn his mother's soul out of his old Evangelion Unit, had tea in high Earth orbit, rescued his father from durance vile, and then punched him in the face. She'd had a wild day?
真嗣从僵硬中回过神来，急忙整理了一下裤子，跟在后面。他穿越了半个太阳系，从旧的福音战士机体中抽出了母亲的灵魂，在地球高轨道上喝了茶，从牢狱中救出了父亲，然后给了他一拳。她的一天很疯狂？

He stepped into the brightness of the portal and exited on the patio of their beach house. Ching was sitting at the umbrella shaded table with a picnic basket. His parents were nowhere to be seen.
他踏入传送门的明亮光芒，出现在他们的海滩别墅的露台上。青正在遮阳伞下的桌旁，旁边放着一个野餐篮。他的父母不见踪影。

He looked up and down the beach without result. "Daniel, where did my parents go? Why aren't they here?"
他上下打量着海滩，却一无所获。“丹尼尔，我父母去哪儿了？为什么他们不在这里？”

"They're getting settled into their own cabin a short distance away. Your mother needs to have a long talk with your father, and frankly you father's going to be useless for anything for a while now that he has her back. Reuniting with her has been the single-minded obsession that controlled every waking moment of his life for most of the last sixteen years, the justification for every horrible thing he did. For the last four years he has had to live with the knowledge that every sin he committed in that name was pointless once he had failed. Now that he's had that failure undone in a moment and he has your mother back, he may go completely to pieces, especially once he has to reckon with the costs of what he did. He could live with anything but your mother's disapproval, which he now has to face the real chance of."
他们正在不远处的小屋安顿下来。你母亲需要和你父亲进行一次长谈，坦白说，你父亲现在对她回来后将一事无成。与她重聚是他过去十六年中大部分清醒时刻的唯一执念，也是他为所做的一切可怕事情辩解的理由。过去四年里，他不得不忍受着这样的认知：一旦失败，他为此犯下的所有罪行都变得毫无意义。现在他的失败被瞬间逆转，你母亲回来了，他可能会彻底崩溃，尤其是当他不得不面对自己所作所为的代价时。他可以忍受任何事，唯独不能忍受你母亲的责备，而现在他不得不面对这种可能性。

Shinji joined Asuka at the table. Asuka was staring at the plate of small steaming fresh loaves of bread and cuts of sushi that Ching had just served her. She gave Daniel a sardonic look. "Really?"
真嗣加入到明日香所在的餐桌。明日香正盯着青刚刚端上来的热腾腾的小面包和寿司切片。她向丹尼尔投去一个讽刺的眼神。“真的吗？”

Daniel just grinned back. "You provoke the Duke of Puns at your peril, young lady," Rayana snarked. "You put out a straight line like that, he's going to swing at it."
丹尼尔只是回以一笑。"你敢挑衅双关公爵，年轻的小姐，你可要当心了，"雷阿娜嘲讽道，"你抛出这么直白的梗，他肯定会接招的。"

Shinji helped himself to a bit off his own plate. Fresh tuna sushi. It had been a long time since he'd seen that. He chewed on what Rayana had said as well. They had been speaking in Japanese. It must have been some joke in German. "So you saw the end. We got my dad out of a down deep cell that Winthrop has hidden him in. I guess he wanted him alive in case he ever needed a public scapegoat or something. And Rayana flew us past Mars to get my mother's soul out of Eva Unit-01. Did you and Daniel get your mother back too? Where is she?"
真嗣从自己的盘子里夹了些食物。新鲜的金枪鱼寿司。他已经很久没见过这个了。他一边咀嚼，一边思考雷阿娜的话。他们一直在用日语交谈。那一定是德语里的某个笑话。"所以你看到了结局。我们把我父亲从温思罗普藏匿的深牢中救了出来。我想他留我父亲一命，以防将来需要一个公开的替罪羊什么的。然后雷阿娜带我们飞越火星，从 EVA 初号机中取出了我母亲的灵魂。你和丹尼尔也找回你们的母亲了吗？她在哪里？"

"Oh, yeah, we did, plus a few other stops." Asuka gave him a shark-like grin. He hadn't seen her smile like that in years. "A little of this, and little of that, a couple of heroic rescues, I shot a few people, and then we went shopping." She chomped down on an improvised sandwich she'd made, still smiling. "Mmm, lunch."
哦，是的，我们也找回了，还顺路去了几个地方。"明日香给了他一个鲨鱼般的笑容。他已经好几年没见过她这样笑了。"一点这个，一点那个，几次英勇的救援，我开枪打了几个人，然后我们去购物了。"她大口吃着自己做的即兴三明治，依然面带微笑。"嗯，午餐。

Shinji dropped his next bite. "Y-you shot some people?!"
真嗣吓得掉了下一口食物。"你——你开枪打人了?!"

"The firing squad about to execute my mother? Fuck yes I did. You can't tell me there is anything wrong with that, Third!" Asuka shot back hotly. "I'd do it again, too."
行刑队即将处决我母亲？我当然干了。你不能告诉我这有什么不对，第三！" 明日香激烈地反驳道，"我还会再做一次。

"Nemo Me Impune Lacessit, ne, Asuka?" Rayana observed. "I know you very much do not like to kill, Shinji, but you have to admit, there are some times and situations where its justified. Plenty of the people working for Winthrop, for example. Or Jinnai now, come to that. And people about to shoot your mother? I don't think Asuka's done any wrong on that one."
无人能无伤我，不是吗，明日香？" 蕾雅娜评论道，"我知道你非常不喜欢杀人，真嗣，但你必须承认，有些时候和情况下，这是有理由的。比如为温思罗普工作的人，或者现在为神谷工作的人。还有那些即将射杀你母亲的人？我认为明日香在那件事上没有做错。

Shinji stared down at his plate. He couldn't disagree with her. But he still didn't like it. He had too much blood on his hands already. It was his despairing choice that had led to the world that Winthrop and his type now ruled. 'Could I have done the same? For my mother? Or my father?' A different thought struck him. 'Or for her?' He'd been willing to die for her. His mind shied away from considering if he'd kill for her. He didn't think he'd like the answer either way. Especially as a tiny voice firmly whispered 'You were ready to when you wrote that note.' "No, I guess not. But we used to work for Winthrop too. And still do for Jinnai."
真嗣低头盯着他的盘子。他无法反驳她。但他仍然不喜欢这样。他的手上已经沾满了太多鲜血。正是他绝望的选择导致了现在温思罗普和他这类人统治的世界。'我也会这么做吗？为了我的母亲？还是我的父亲？' 另一个念头击中了他。'还是为了她？' 他曾愿意为她而死。他的思绪回避了考虑是否愿意为她杀人的问题。他也不认为他会喜欢这个答案。特别是当一个微小的声音坚定地低语 '你写那张纸条时已经准备好了。' "不，我想不是。但我们以前也为温思罗普工作过。现在仍然为神谷工作。"

"Which is why target discrimination and appropriate levels of force are integral parts of our military's training. We know that purely evil people and groups are thankfully rare. So we exercise careful attention when it comes to meting out judgment on those who become our enemies." Daniel swallowed a bit of his own fish. "And as for Jinnai, we'll see to him later. Death may be a little too merciful for him."
这就是为什么目标识别和适当的武力级别是我们军事训练中不可或缺的部分。我们知道纯粹邪恶的人和团体幸好是罕见的。因此，在对待那些成为我们敌人的人时，我们会格外小心地做出判断。" 丹尼尔咽下了自己鱼的一部分。"至于阵内，我们稍后再处理他。死亡对他来说可能太仁慈了。

"You still brood too much, Third. And my mother's inside. She's still got healing to do before she'll be awake. But I've got her back. And I got my revenge on the people who were about to take her from me again. That's all that matters to me, that I've got my Mama back." Asuka finished off her sandwich with a soft smile.
"你还是太忧郁了，第三。我母亲在里面。她还需要恢复才能醒来。但我已经保护好她了。我已经对那些即将再次夺走她的人进行了报复。对我来说，最重要的是我已经把妈妈带回来了。" 明日香带着温柔的微笑吃完了她的三明治。

Shinji stared in amazement. This was a very different Asuka than the one he'd gone to sleep next to. It was rather disconcerting. 'Damn. I need some time to think about suddenly having my parents back to deal with. And now add a radically revised Asuka on top of that,' he thought to himself.
真嗣惊讶地盯着。这是与他同床共枕的那个明日香截然不同的一个人。这相当令人不安。'该死。我需要一些时间来思考突然要面对父母的问题。现在再加上一个彻底改变的明日香，' 他自言自语道。

Asuka noticed his downcast eyes again. "This will cheer you up; I've got a surprise for you. We've got a dinner date for tonight, Third. The closets in this place are full of stuff in our sizes. They raided my Berlin apartment's closets via remote scan. I'll pick out your outfit, since your fashion sense has always been about as sparkling as your witty banter."
明日香再次注意到他低垂的眼神。"这会让你振作起来；我给你准备了一个惊喜。今晚我们有个晚餐约会，第三。这里的衣柜里装满了适合我们尺码的衣服。他们通过远程扫描洗劫了我的柏林公寓的衣柜。我会帮你挑选衣服，因为你的时尚感和你机智的谈吐一样闪耀。"

Shinji blinked at her again. "What? We're going on a date? Us?" 'Did I miss something? A day ago she barely let me touch her.'
真嗣再次眨眼看着她。"什么？我们要去约会？我们俩？" '我错过了什么吗？一天前她几乎不让我碰她。'

"Not that kind of date, baka. I've got a surprise for you at this dinner. I told you, I went shopping. Once again, I'm miles ahead of you. I've been a busy girl, rescuing those in peril and piloting the hottest ride in the world."
不是那种约会，笨蛋。我在晚餐上给你准备了惊喜。我告诉过你，我去购物了。我又一次领先你很多。我一直很忙，拯救那些处于危险中的人，驾驶着世界上最酷的座驾。

"Technically, you're about six hours ahead of him, Asuka," Daniel interjected. He looked at Shinji. "Our little shopping trip took a while, and we made other stops besides her mother, but I'd promised Asuka she'd get the second shot in on your father after you, so we've doubled back a bit to make it there. You'll need the extra rest tonight, Asuka."
从技术上讲，你大约领先他六个小时，明日香，"丹尼尔插话道。他看着真嗣。"我们的小购物之旅花了一些时间，除了她母亲那里，我们还去了其他地方，但我答应过明日香，在你之后她会得到第二次机会对付你父亲，所以我们稍微绕了点路去那里。今晚你需要额外的休息，明日香。

Asuka waved her hand. "I'll be fine. After that ride, I feel like a million Euros."
明日香挥了挥手，“我没事。经历了那次骑行，我感觉自己像是赚了一百万欧元。”

"What ride?" Shinji asked. 'Great, what else have I missed?'
"什么骑行？" 真嗣问道。'太好了，我还错过了什么？'

"Ching promised to show me what she drives. So after Daniel and I got done shopping, we went aboard my ship," Asuka's grin almost made Shinji blink it was so bright. "And she let me tool around for a couple of hours in the trainer variant of her StarStrider mecha. Forget our creaky, patchwork MP Eva, I'm taking one of those home! Ha! Fast as hell, transformable, loaded with weapons, and way more than just an AT-Field generator for defenses. It's a two-seater too, so I'm not kicking you out, Third. You'll be in the backseat, but I'll still let you come along."
“青承诺要给我展示她驾驶的东西。所以在丹尼尔和我购物结束后，我们登上了我的船，”明日香的笑容几乎让真嗣眨眼，因为它太耀眼了。“她让我在她的星际骑手机甲的训练版上玩了几个小时。忘记我们那破旧不堪的 MP 初号机吧，我要带一台那种回家！哈！快得要命，可变形，装满了武器，防御力远不止一个 AT 力场发生器。还是双座位的，所以我不会把你赶出去，第三。你会坐在后座，但我还是会让你一起来的。”

Asuka was...practically bubbling. He hadn't seen her like this since they'd beaten Matariel together with Rei. Asuka had been at the peak of her days as an Eva Pilot, and had led them through the blackout of the Geofront to a successful battle based on her plan of attack. Things had gotten darker after that, but for that day at least Asuka had been living her dream of being the ace Pilot, savior of humanity, and leader. She'd glowed that night, when they were all sitting on the overlook hill, watching the city light up again. Shinji had had to force his eyes away to look at the city. He could have spent the whole night staring at her.
明日香那时简直是兴高采烈。自从他们和绫波一起击败了马特里尔以来，他还没见过她这样。明日香作为 Eva 驾驶员的巅峰时期，带领他们穿越了 Geofront 的停电，并根据她的攻击计划取得了一场胜利的战斗。那之后事情变得更加黑暗，但至少在那一天，明日香实现了她成为王牌驾驶员、人类救世主和领袖的梦想。那天晚上，当他们一起坐在俯瞰山丘上，看着城市再次亮起灯光时，她光彩照人。真嗣不得不强迫自己移开视线去看城市。他本可以整晚都凝视着她。

But that was a long time and a lot of vicious trauma ago. She'd been an uncommunicative wreck after the Third Impact, and a harsh, brittle companion in Winthrop's Berlin. This...would take getting used to. And he'd have to make sure to keep his lap covered, again. Damn it. Oh, crap, their hosts were getting up.
但那是很久以前的事了，经历了许多残酷的创伤。第三次冲击后，她变得沉默寡言，在温沃斯的柏林成了一个严厉而脆弱的同伴。这...需要一段时间去适应。而且他还得确保再次遮住自己的膝盖。该死。哦，糟糕，他们的主人站起来了。

"We've hit you two with a lot this morning, so I think that's enough for today in terms of wild rescues and travels. Relax and enjoy the rest of the day. We'll see you at the dinner tonight. We'll pick you up at 2300," Daniel said. "Eat all you like; the basket has as many as you want."
今天早上我们已经给你们俩安排了很多活动，所以我想关于惊险救援和旅行的部分就到此为止吧。放松一下，享受剩下的时光。我们晚餐时见。我们会在 2300 来接你们，" 丹尼尔说。"尽情吃吧；篮子里的食物应有尽有。

Asuka snorted. "Very funny."
明日香嗤笑一声。"真好笑。"

"If you want funny, ask the house system to show you 'Daniel's Eva Synch Test clip #1'. You might need to explain the 'Old MacDonald' thing to Shinji first," Daniel said.
"如果你想找乐子，就让家居系统给你播放'丹尼尔的 Eva 同步测试片段#1'。你可能得先向真嗣解释一下'老麦克唐纳'的事情，" 丹尼尔说。

"I'm glad you had a good time flying with me this morning, Asuka. I'll be just down the trail if either of you need me for anything." Lieutenant Leibshott bowed her way out.
"很高兴你今早和我一起飞行时玩得开心，明日香。如果你们俩需要我帮忙，我就在小径的那头。" 莱布施托中尉鞠躬告辞。

"And we're just a call away. We'll see you tonight," Rayana said, and snapped her fingers. She and Daniel vanished in a pillar of fire.
"我们只需一通电话就能赶到。今晚见，" 雷安娜说道，并打了个响指。她和丹尼尔在一柱火焰中消失了。

That quickly, they were alone. Shinji met Asuka's eyes. She grinned like a shark again. Shinji gulped. He knew that look. It usually meant Asuka had a great idea that she was about to hit him with.
转眼间，他们就孤身一人了。真嗣与明日香对视，她再次露出了鲨鱼般的笑容。真嗣咽了口口水，他知道那种表情，通常意味着明日香有了一个绝妙的主意，正准备对他施展。

"Eat up, Third. I'm too full of energy to sit still for long, and as soon as we're done eating I'm taking you to see something awesome." She made another fish sandwich and started chewing.
"快吃吧，第三。我精力充沛得坐不住，吃完饭我就带你去看些超棒的东西。" 她又做了一个鱼肉三明治，开始大口咀嚼。

Yup, she had an idea. He was going to get dragged all the way through it somehow, he just knew. He reached into the basket for more sushi. He had a feeling he was going to need the energy.
没错，她有了主意。他有种预感，自己将会被卷入其中，他只是知道。他伸手从篮子里拿出更多的寿司，他觉得他需要这些能量。

Asuka kept darting glances at her watch as they ate. 'Wait a minute, she doesn't wear a watch.' Shinji finally really looked at her wrist. She now had a broad silver band around her left wrist, just like the ones he'd seen Ching and Daniel wearing. Asuka kept looking at it every few minutes and pressing a green icon on one corner. Every time she did, she smiled in a way Shinji had never seen on her face outside of the stranger parts of Instrumentality, the parts where a Rei-Misato-Asuka blurring had been sitting in/on his chest. A smile devoid of any shadows. A smile Shinji wished more than anything she'd turn on him.
明日香一边吃饭一边不停地瞥着手表。'等等，她不戴手表的。' 真嗣终于认真地看了看她的手腕。现在她的左手腕上戴着一条宽大的银色手环，就像他之前看到阿静和丹尼尔戴的那种。明日香每隔几分钟就看一眼，并按下角落里的一个绿色图标。每次这样做时，她都会露出真嗣从未在除了人类补完计划中那些奇怪部分之外见过的笑容，那些部分里，零、美里和明日香的身影模糊地融合在一起，坐在他的胸口上。那是一种没有阴影的笑容。真嗣无比希望她能对他露出这样的笑容。

Whatever she was looking at on it had her fascinated. She eventually noticed his stare when she looked up. Shinji looked away quickly. Most of the time, Asuka noticing him staring at her resulted in a tirade at the least. This time it resulted in something else. There was a rustle of cloth and a slender white arm stuck itself under his nose.
她所注视的东西显然让她着迷。当她抬头时，终于注意到了他的目光。真嗣迅速移开视线。大多数时候，明日香发现他盯着她看，至少会引发一阵怒斥。但这次却有了不同的结果。一阵布料摩擦声后，一条纤细的白色手臂伸到了他的鼻子底下。

"You wanna see, Third, you'd better look down," Asuka said with odd pride. Shinji complied, and gasped. It was like her wrist wasn't there, and he was looking down into a window to the interior of a room. A woman that Shinji recognized from flashes of Asuka's memories in Instrumentality as her mother lay on a bed with another woman sitting by the bed, watching her and reading a book in her lap. The other woman's hair was the same color and Rei's, but the pointed ears said it was definitely not her. A heartbeat indicator and a few other vital stats lit up the corner of the image.
"你想看的话，第三，最好往下看，"明日香带着奇怪的骄傲说道。真嗣照做了，倒吸一口凉气。她的手腕仿佛不存在，他正透过一扇窗窥视着房间内部。床上躺着一个女人，真嗣从人类补完计划中明日香的记忆片段中认出那是她的母亲，旁边坐着另一个女人，守在床边，膝上放着一本书。另一个女人的头发颜色与绫波相同，但尖尖的耳朵表明那绝不是她。心跳指示器和其他几项生命体征在图像的角落亮起。

Asuka's voice was...warm? He had never heard her talk like this before. Shinji shook himself and focused on what she way saying. "My mother is sleeping in our cabin. Daniel said she needs about a week of healing sleep for the tear in her soul to close, and then she'll be with me again. The priestess is there to watch over her whenever I'm not there, so she's never alone."
明日香的声音……是温暖的吗？他从未听过她这样说话。真嗣摇了摇头，集中注意力听她的话。"我母亲在我们的船舱里睡觉。丹尼尔说她需要大约一周的恢复性睡眠，以便灵魂的裂痕愈合，之后她就能再次与我同在。女祭司在那里照看她，当我不在时，她永远不会孤单。"

Shinji tried not to move. To keep the image from being upside-down to his perspective, Asuka had moved to stand right behind his chair and lean over him so she could wrap her arm around his left side, presenting the image on her wristband right-side up. It also nearly put Shinji into a close embrace. He could feel her breath tickling his left ear. He could feel a few other things, too. He quickly crossed his legs. "Ah, that's...that's wonderful, Asuka."
真嗣尽量保持不动。为了让图像不至于颠倒过来，明日香已经移动到他的椅子后面，俯身越过他，用胳膊环绕他的左侧，这样她手腕上的图像就能正过来。这几乎让真嗣陷入了亲密的拥抱。他能感觉到她的呼吸轻拂着他的左耳。他还感觉到了其他一些东西。他迅速交叉双腿。“啊，那真是……太棒了，明日香。”

The arm withdrew and she stood up, smacking him on the back of the head. "Pervert. I saw that. Hurry up, I wanna get going."
手臂抽回，她站直身子，朝他后脑勺拍了一下。“色狼。我看到了。快点，我想走了。”

"Ow. Going where?" He rubbed the back of his head. She still smelled good.
“哎哟。去哪儿？”他揉着后脑勺。她身上还是那么好闻。

"I told you, to show you something awesome. Two things. Hurry up, I'm calling to set it up now." She pressed her finger to the band again and spoke into it as she held it up to her mouth. "Call Ching-Hao Leibshott." The band beeped softly.
“我告诉过你，要给你看些很棒的东西。两样。快点，我现在就打电话安排。”她再次用手指触碰腕带，并将其举到嘴边说话。“呼叫秦浩·莱布肖特。”腕带轻轻地哔了一声。

"'Allo?" 喂？

"Hallo, Ching! K?nnen wir nochmal mit dem übungsmech raus? Jetzt?"
你好，Ching！我们还能再出去练习一下吗？现在？

Shinji could just hear Ching's tiny voice replying."Oh, meinst du 'du und ich', oder 'du und Shinji'?" She was asking about him? She sounded amused.
真嗣只能听到 Ching 微弱的声音回答道："哦，你是说'你和我'，还是'你和真嗣'？" 她在问关于他的事？她听起来很开心。

"Der Dritte und ich. Ich will ihm mein Schiff zu zeigen!" Good gods, she sounded...cheery. What had she been doing while he was with Rayana? He heard Ching laugh, and respond with "Ich sorge dafür dass euch wer abholt.."
第三位和我。我想向他展示我的飞船！" 天哪，她听起来...很高兴。他和 Rayana 在一起时她做了什么？他听到 Ching 笑了，并回应说："我会确保有人来接你们的。

"Gut! Danke! Und tschüs!" Asuka lowered her arm and smirked at him. "Our pickup will call in a few minutes, Third. Hurry and finish. If you're done before it gets here, I'll show you that clip...On second thought, hurry up, I want to see it too. Daniel described it to me while we were out, and it sounds great. Dr. Akagi throwing a screaming fit, heh. Wish I could have done that to the bitch. Come on." She walked into the house. "I can look in on Mama, too!"
太好了！谢谢！再见！" 明日香放下手臂，朝他咧嘴一笑。"我们的接应几分钟后会打电话来，第三。快点结束。如果你在它到达之前完成，我会给你看那个视频...再一想，快点，我也想看。丹尼尔在我们出去的时候向我描述了，听起来很棒。赤木博士大发雷霆，呵呵。真希望我也能对那个贱人那样做。快点。" 她走进屋子。"我也可以去看看妈妈！

Shinji swallowed the last bite of his sushi, and followed her. This day was working on catching up to the day of the Third Impact as the strangest one in his life.
真嗣咽下最后一口寿司，跟了上去。这一天正逐渐成为他一生中最奇怪的一天，堪比第三次冲击的那天。

### Chapter 09 New Toys, Old Fears

Ten minutes later, Shinji was still wiping his eyes from the best laugh he'd had in years. Once Asuka had checked in on her mother, she'd sat him down on the living room couch and explained the 'Old MacDonald' song from America to him, then told the house system to show them the funniest synch test he'd ever seen. The sight of Misato snorting coffee out her nose when she caught the joke had him almost rolling on the floor. He had no idea Dr. Akagi could swear so thoroughly like that. He was about to ask Asuka to play it again when her wristband chimed.

十分钟后，真嗣仍因多年来最畅快的一次笑声而擦拭着眼睛。在明日香探望完母亲后，她让他在客厅沙发上坐下，向他解释了来自美国的“老麦克唐纳”歌曲，随后让家居系统播放了他所见过的最搞笑的同步测试视频。看到美里因领会到笑话而将咖啡从鼻子里喷出的情景，他差点笑得在地上打滚。他没想到赤木博士竟能如此彻底地咒骂。正当他准备请求明日香再放一遍时，她的腕带响起了提示音。

She tapped it and spoke into it again. "Hallo, hier spricht Pilot Sohryu."

她轻敲了一下，再次对着它说道：“喂，这里是飞行员惣流。”

"Guten tag, Pilot Sohryu. Dies ist ALS Flugbetrieb. Sie und ein Gast transportbereit?" said a woman's voice.

"您好，碇真嗣飞行员。这里是 ALS 飞行操作。您和一位客人准备好了吗？"一个女人的声音说道。

"Ja, wir sind soweit." She stood up and waved at Shinji. "Stand up, Third, or you're going to fall on your ass when we get there."

"是的，我们准备好了。"她站起来向真嗣挥手，"站起来，第三，否则我们到那里时你会摔个屁股墩。"

"Huh?" Shinji had no idea what she was talking about, but stood up anyway. His world abruptly went electric blue and fuzzy, and the beach house disappeared. When his sight cleared again, he was standing on a metal deck in a cavernous hangar. He looked around in wonder at the huge compartment big enough to have parked several blocks of Tokyo-3 in with ease.

"嗯？" 真嗣完全不明白她在说什么，但还是站了起来。他的世界突然变成了一片电光蓝和模糊，海滨别墅消失了。当他的视线再次清晰时，他正站在一个巨大的机库中的金属甲板上。他惊讶地环顾四周，这个巨大的空间足以轻松容纳几个东京-3 的街区。

A tug on his collar swung him around. "This way, Third." Asuka pulled him through the doorway behind him into one wall of the massive bay and down a short hallway to another door. Slightly humid air and the sound of dripping water let him know it was a locker room he'd been dragged into even before he turned around. Asuka finally let him go at the first bank of lockers. "Get dressed, and if you look around the other side before I come get you, I'll rip your arm off and beat you with the gooey end." She disappeared around the corner without a look back.

他领子上的拉扯让他转过身来。"这边，第三。"飞鸟拉着他穿过他身后的门口，进入巨大舱室的一面墙，然后沿着一条短走廊到达另一扇门。略带湿气的空气和滴水声让他还没转身就知道被拖进了一个更衣室。飞鸟终于在第一排储物柜前放开了他。"换好衣服，如果我在来接你之前你敢往另一边偷看，我就扯下你的胳膊，用黏糊糊的那头揍你。"她头也不回地消失在拐角处。

Shinji looked after her for a second in confusion. 'Get dressed? In what?' He looked at the smooth locker door next to him. The nameplate read S. Ikari. The metal, engraved nameplate. It still looked sharp-edged and new, but... Curious, he pressed the green button that opened the locker. A round glass-fronted half-helmet and a plugsuit-like outfit were neatly stacked on the top shelves with a towel and shower gear below. Shinji had the grim certainty that the helmet and suit would fit him perfectly. He shrugged and started to undress.

碇真嗣困惑地盯着她看了一会儿。'穿什么？'他看向身旁光滑的储物柜门。名牌上写着 S. 碇。那金属材质、雕刻而成的名牌依旧锋利如新，但……出于好奇，他按下了打开柜子的绿色按钮。柜子顶部整齐地摆放着半圆形玻璃面罩的头盔和类似插入栓服的装束，下面则是毛巾和洗浴用品。真嗣有种不祥的预感，那头盔和衣服会完美贴合他的身形。他耸了耸肩，开始脱衣服。

He'd just sealed up the surprisingly light flight suit and picked up his helmet when Asuka came back around the corner. Shinji was not surprised in the least that her suit was the same bright red as her still-worn A10 interface headset. She'd even somehow gotten 02 printed on it below her throat. He looked down at his own chest. Yup, 01, right where it always had been.

他刚封好那件出奇轻的飞行服，拿起头盔，这时明日香又从拐角处回来了。真嗣一点也不惊讶她的飞行服和仍然戴着的 A10 接口耳机一样鲜红。她甚至不知怎么在喉咙下方印上了 02 的字样。他低头看向自己的胸前。没错，01，一如既往地在那里。

Asuka was smiling in that predatory way again. It was starting to make Shinji nervous, since he seemed to be the usual target. "Ready for me to blow your mind, Third? Let's get into my new hot rod." She turned him around and pushed him back out into the bay.

明日香又露出了那种捕食者般的微笑，这让真嗣开始感到不安，因为他似乎总是那个目标。“准备好让我震撼你的心灵了吗，第三？让我们一起体验我的新座驾。”她转过他的身子，推着他重新回到了机库。

"Your new hot rod?" Shinji asked as she finished pushing him to the railing of the walkway where they'd first appeared.

"你的新跑车？" 真嗣问道，此时她刚把他推到他们初次出现的走道栏杆旁。

She struck a proud pose like the one she'd done when she unveiled Unit-02 to him the day they'd met. She pointed, the same glow of pride on her face. "There! Meet my new baby, Der Roter Wirbelsturm!"

她摆出了一个骄傲的姿势，就像她初次向他展示二号机那天一样。她指向某处，脸上洋溢着同样的自豪光芒。“看那儿！来见见我的新宝贝，‘红色旋风’！”

Shinji's eyes went to the tall red wall she was pointing at. 'Wait, that's not a wall, that's a...oh sweet gods, she's even had it painted the same way.'

真嗣的目光顺着她所指的方向，落在了那堵高大的红墙上。'等等，那不是墙，那是……哦，天哪，她甚至让人把它漆成了同样的样式。'

Asuka's new toy was an eighty meter tall mecha that already had the same red, orange, and white color scheme as her vanished Unit-02. Shinji swallowed again. He had a strong suspicion about what was about to happen. At least this time he wasn't wearing a girl's plugsuit. That had pinched in awkward places.

明日香的新玩具是一台高达八十米的机甲，其红、橙、白三色涂装与她那消失的二号机如出一辙。真嗣再次咽了咽口水，他强烈预感到即将发生的事情。至少这次，他没有穿着那件不合身的女孩驾驶服，那东西曾在尴尬之处勒得难受。

Asuka grabbed his hand and led him up the gantry to the lower of two ports on the back of the mecha's lower torso. "This is the pilot's access port. Get in and get ready. I've already got piloting this thing nailed. Wait until you see what it can do!"

明日香抓住他的手，领着他沿着步道走向机甲下躯干背部的两个入口中较低的那个。“这是驾驶员入口。进去做好准备。我已经完全掌握了驾驶这玩意儿的技巧。等着瞧它的厉害吧！”

"Wait, I don't know anything about how to drive one of these things!" He protested futilely.

"等等，我根本不知道怎么开这种东西！" 他徒劳地抗议道。

Asuka snorted. "And you didn't know anything about how to pilot an Evangelion when you tore apart the third Angel. Since when has not knowing anything slowed you down? Besides, I'll be doing the driving from the trainer's spot. In the mecha, Third!" She manhandled him around and shoved him feet first into the narrow port.

明日香哼了一声。“你摧毁第三使徒时，对驾驶初号机一无所知。什么时候无知成了你的绊脚石？再说，我会从训练员的位置操控。机甲里，第三！”她粗暴地将他转过来，把他双脚先推进狭窄的入口。

Shinji worked his feet into the foot braces blindly and let out a startled gasp as the chest frame clamped around him. His blind fingers wrapped around two joysticks and two more frames tightened around his upper arms. Displays started lighting up around him and a huge screen that seemed to be the entire front of the cockpit lit up with a view of the bay.

真嗣盲目地将脚伸进脚踏板，当胸架紧紧夹住他时，他惊呼一声。他看不见的手指握住两个操纵杆，另外两个框架随之收紧，固定住他的上臂。周围的显示屏开始亮起，一个巨大的屏幕，仿佛占据了整个驾驶舱的前方，亮了起来，展现出机库的景象。

"Um, Asuka, how do you know how to pilot one of these things? You didn't this morning!" Shinji worried.

"呃，明日香，你怎么会驾驶这东西的？你早上还不会呢！" 真嗣担忧地问。

"And I've had a whole morning to learn. Relax, Third, I know this beautiful beast inside and out. They've got some awesome learning gear around here. I've already had the full basic piloting and technical course zapped into my head. Now hold on tight while I take us out." Asuka switched channels and languages to the flight ops net. "Bay G5-791 Launch Control, this is Red Crown flight 2, ready to sortie," she said in English.

我整个上午都在学习。放心吧，老三，我对这头美丽的野兽了如指掌。这里有些超棒的学习设备。我已经完成了基础驾驶和技术课程的全面灌输。现在抓紧了，我要带我们出去了。" 明日香切换频道和语言到飞行操作网。"G5-791 发射控制，这里是红冠飞行 2 号，准备出击，" 她用英语说道。

"Glad to have you back with us so fast, Pilot. Lane clear and we are monitoring. You may launch when ready," said the clear response in the same tongue in his ear. "Show the Third Child a good time."

"很高兴你这么快就归队了，飞行员。跑道已清空，我们正在监控。准备好了就可以起飞。" 耳边传来清晰的回应，同样使用着这种语言，"给第三子一个愉快的时光。"

"Oooh, I always do," Asuka cooed back. "Red Crown 2, launching now." The mecha began walking swiftly towards the cavernous bay doors that slid aside to their left.

"哦，我总是这样。" 明日香柔声回应，"红冠 2 号，现在出发。" 机甲开始迅速向左侧滑开的巨大舱门走去。

All of a sudden, Shinji regretted learning English during his time in Boston. He really didn't want to have heard that. As Asuka rapidly accelerated the giant machine down the tunnel, he knew she'd make him pay for it somehow.

突然间，真嗣后悔在波士顿期间学了英语。他真希望自己没听到那句话。随着明日香驾驶着巨型机器在隧道中飞速前进，他知道她会以某种方式让他为此付出代价。

Six hours earlier... 六小时前...

"Wow." Asuka stared straight up. She could barely even see the roof of the vast bay they stood in. You could have dropped the entire Reichstag in here a dozen times and not even taken up a majority of the space. And according to what Ching had said, the bay they stood in was a minor one on this ship, which was itself bigger than Luna. "Christ!"

"哇。" 明日香直直地向上望去。她几乎看不到他们所处巨大船坞的顶棚。这里足以将整个国会大厦丢进来十几次，空间还绰绰有余。而根据青所说，他们所在的这个船坞在这艘船上只是一个小角色，而这艘船本身就比月球还要大。"天哪！"

Ching had been waiting on the beach when she, Daniel, and the second 'engagement gift' they'd just rescued had returned from her world. Daniel had taken their rescuee off to the clinic, and Ching had told her she'd made arrangements to give her a ride in the trainer variant of her usual battle mecha. Asuka had asked where, and Ching had pointed at the faintly visible glow of one of the half-moons overhead. That was no moon, it turned out. It was a ship, part of the Imperial Navy squadron in orbit. A ship big enough to have looked like a smooth bronze-colored moon from the ground. A word from Ching into her interface band, and they'd been teleported right up to her.

晴在海滩上等待时，她和丹尼尔以及刚从她的世界救出的第二个“订婚礼物”已经返回。丹尼尔带着被救者去了诊所，而晴告诉她，她已经安排好让她乘坐她常用战斗机甲的训练版。明日香询问地点，晴指向天空中隐约可见的半个月亮的光辉。那并非月亮，结果发现是一艘船，属于帝国海军轨道中队的舰船。一艘从地面看去宛如光滑青铜色月亮的巨舰。晴通过接口带发出指令，他们便被直接传送到了那艘船上。

And now Asuka found herself suited up and standing in one of its launch bays, waiting for Ching to return from speaking to the bay chief about their sortie. Asuka ran her eyes over the mecha again, and tried not to drool. It was gorgeous. Gleaming silver with blue trim, easily much larger than her Evangelion's 50 meters, far sleeker looking, and it just oozed speed. Much thicker bodied, too. Ching assured her it was armor, internal weapons systems, and a huge, almost unlimited powerplant that gave it the much heftier lines than the anorexic-looking Evas. She couldn't wait to take it out. She cradled the headset Ching had handed her and tried it on again. An open-topped partial helmet, it didn't even require her to remove her omnipresent red A10 interface headset. The transparent band across her eyes would work as a HUD, too. All the functionality she could ask for, and it didn't give her helmet-hair. Nice. Even the pilot's suit she'd put on felt easy to move in, and had a lot more life support gear than her plugsuit.

此刻，明日香已身着装备，站在其中一个发射舱内，等待青从与舱室负责人的交谈中归来，商讨他们的出击事宜。她再次将目光投向那台机甲，竭力抑制住内心的垂涎。它美得令人窒息——银光闪闪，蓝边点缀，远超她那五十米高的福音战士，外观更为流线，仿佛速度的化身。机身也更为厚实。青向她保证，这厚重的线条源于其坚固的装甲、内置武器系统以及庞大到近乎无限的能源核心，与纤细的 EVA 截然不同。她迫不及待想要驾驭它。她把玩着青递给她的头戴设备，再次尝试佩戴。这是一款开放式的半盔，无需摘下她常戴的红色 A10 接口头带。横亘眼前的透明带还能充当抬头显示器。功能一应俱全，又不会弄乱她的发型，实在贴心。就连身上的驾驶员服也活动自如，携带的生命维持装备远超她的插入栓服。

Ching walked back to her from the control booth. "They're ready for us on this end. They've cleared out a block of space for us to run around in, and their flight ops controllers are happy to have something to do besides the usual routine."

青从控制室走回她身边，“这边已经准备好了。他们为我们腾出了一块空间供我们活动，飞行操作控制员们也很高兴能有事情打破日常的常规。”

"And they're happy to just let a random Pilot from another world borrow one of their trainers? I didn't know Lieutenant was such a high rank around here."

他们就这么乐意让一个来自异世界的随机飞行员借用他们的教练机？我没想到中尉在这里竟是如此高阶的军衔。

"Well, the magic words 'a personal guest of the Emperor' open a lot of doors, funnily enough. It's his fleet, and they're on this station to be on call for orders anyhow. We're not interrupting anything, and they can recall us in moments if something does come up."

有趣的是，那句神奇的话“皇帝的私人宾客”确实能打开许多门。毕竟这是他的舰队，他们驻扎在这个空间站就是为了随时待命。我们并没有打断任何事情，如果真有什么紧急情况，他们也能立刻召回我们。

"Is that likely?" Asuka asked as they walked to the access gantry.

"那有可能吗？" 飞鸟边走边问，他们正前往通道栈桥。

"No, but we do try to encourage anyone who has hostile intent towards us to come here as much as possible. We even give out coordinates and portal generator plans."

不，但我们确实尽力鼓励任何对我们怀有敌意的人尽可能多地来这里。我们甚至会提供坐标和传送门生成器的计划。

Asuka gave her a crazy look. "Wait, you give out directions and plans to people who want to attack you?"

明日香用一种疯狂的眼神看着她。“等等，你给那些想要攻击你的人提供方向和计划？”

Ching nodded with a grin. "Sure do. If someone's mad enough to want to take a swing at us, we make it easy. You'd be surprised how few are smart enough to question their 'good fortune' that some third party always pops up to give them the information. Then they spend incredible amounts of resources to get here, and never have much time to wonder why we give them coordinates that walk them right into our strongest defenses and a major fleet presence. It makes our enemies waste their energy, brings them within easy reach of tons of our weapons, and gives the Imperial Navy units stationed here some nice, reliably appearing live-fire exercises to play with. The mice never question why the cheese is sitting there, do they? Snap!" She laughed. "Boy, I remember my first run against one of those invasion fleets. They actually demanded our surrender! Hee hee! Yeah, they lasted about ninety minutes, and that was only because the fleet commander decided to let the mecha corps take them out instead of the main fleet combatants or the system defenses. Ah, good times..." She continued chuckling as she helped Asuka into the narrow pilot access port, then climbed up into the trainer-leader's port.

青点头笑道：“当然有。如果有人气得想对我们动手，我们就让他们轻松上钩。你可能会惊讶，有多少人聪明到会怀疑他们的‘好运’，总有个第三方跳出来提供信息。然后他们耗费大量资源来到这里，却没多少时间去想为什么我们给他们的坐标正好让他们走进我们最强的防御和主力舰队的包围圈。这使得我们的敌人浪费精力，把他们引到我们众多武器的射程内，还给驻扎在此的帝国海军单位提供了一些不错的、定期出现的实弹演习机会。老鼠从不会质疑为什么奶酪就摆在那儿，对吧？咔嚓！”她笑了起来，“哎呀，我记得第一次对抗那种入侵舰队。他们居然要求我们投降！嘻嘻！是啊，他们撑了大约九十分钟，那还是因为舰队指挥官决定让机甲部队去解决他们，而不是用主力舰队或系统防御。啊，美好的时光……”她边笑边帮明日香进入狭窄的驾驶员入口，然后爬进了训练领队的位置。

The tight cockpit was not as roomy as her old Entry Plug. The space she slid into was almost like a full body glove-suit. She slid her feet into semi-boot braces that gently snugged themselves against her calves while a matching frame secured itself around her torso. She put her hands on the joystick at the end of two movable arms that likewise gripped her upper arms. She faintly heard Ching strapping in above her, and the hatches sealing as the Lieutenant brought the huge machine to humming life. A variety of holographic displays and virtual controls sprang to life around her head and in front of her hands. She felt a tingle around her head like the start-up sequence in an Evangelion unit and her sense of body-space expanded until she felt over 50 meters tall again.

狭小的驾驶舱并不如她旧时的插入栓宽敞。她滑入的空间几乎像是一件全身紧身衣。她将双脚伸进半靴式支撑架，这些支撑架轻柔地贴合在她的小腿上，同时一个相配的框架固定在她的躯干周围。她将双手放在可移动臂末端的操纵杆上，这些臂同样紧握着她的上臂。她隐约听到 Ching 在上方的固定声，以及舱门封闭的声音，随着中尉启动这台巨型机器，它开始嗡嗡作响。各种全息显示屏和虚拟控制装置在她头部周围及手前激活。她感到头部周围有一种启动序列的刺痛感，就像在驾驶福音战士单元时一样，她的身体空间感扩展，直到再次感觉自己高达 50 米。

She used to love the rush she got when her Unit-02 came to life around her. Once she'd been torn to shreds by the Mass Production series and lost her mother again, the memory of that rush had become a painful mockery. Now her mother slept alive and well on the planet below, and she was strapping herself into a mecha that would put her old Production Model to shame. She was actually starting to feel a faint stirring of the old excitement again. 'Iku wa yo, Asuka,' she thought to herself.

她曾深爱着，当她的二号机在她周围苏醒时，那种澎湃的激情。自从被量产机型撕裂，再次失去母亲后，那份激情的记忆便成了痛苦的嘲讽。如今，母亲安然无恙地在下方星球沉睡，而她正将自己固定在一台足以令旧生产模型相形见绌的机甲中。她竟开始感受到一丝久违的兴奋在心头悄然萌动。“要出发了，明日香。”她心中默念。

Ching's voice was crystal clear in her ear. "Bay G5-791 Launch Control, this is Red Crown flight 1, ready to sortie."

青的声音在她耳边清晰无比：“湾 G5-791 发射控制中心，这里是红冠飞行 1 号，准备出动。”

A different woman's voice came right back. "Roger, Red Crown 1. Your lane is clear and we're monitoring. You may launch when ready." Accented, but perfect German.

另一个女性的声音立刻回应：“罗杰，红冠一号。你的跑道已清空，我们正在监控。准备好了即可发射。”带着口音，但德语非常标准。

Asuka snorted. 'Does everyone here just happen to speak German, or am I just lucky?' "Hey, Ching, does everyone here learn German or something? This is easier than dealing with the refugees in Berlin these days."

明日香哼了一声。“这里的人是不是都会说德语，还是我运气好？”“嘿，阿静，这里的人是不是都学过德语什么的？这比最近在柏林应付难民还容易。”

"To graduate from basic schooling around here, you need to be literate and fluent in at least four languages besides your birth tongue, so you might get luckier than you think amongst Terran-derived families. But no, you're not getting lucky. I told them to make sure they did all flight communications in German for us. I didn't want any chance of any communications mix-up. If they didn't have someone already on the flight ops staff who knew German, I'm sure they could have had some one learn it before we came up."

在此地完成基础教育，需具备读写能力并至少精通母语之外的四种语言，因此在源自地球的家庭中，你或许比想象中更幸运。然而，幸运并未降临。我已吩咐他们确保所有飞行通讯使用德语。我不希望有任何通讯混淆的可能。若飞行操作团队中无人懂德语，我确信他们能在我们升空前安排人学习。

"Just like that, hmm?" Asuka said with amusement.

“就这样，嗯？”明日香带着戏谑的语气说道。

"Learning a language that's been well mapped to a human neural template for cenmills? Not a problem for us. A few minutes in a NILS and they're good enough to do most things, though it's really better to learn a language the old fashioned way if you want to really understand it. A quick brain blast from a NILS is a good platform to start, though."

学习一种已经很好地映射到人类神经模板上的语言，对于我们来说不是问题。在 NILS 中待上几分钟，他们就能应付大多数事情，尽管如果你真的想深入理解一门语言，还是传统的学习方式更好。从 NILS 快速脑波冲击是一个很好的起点。

"A what?" "一个什么？"

"Neural Induction Learning System. Sufficiently well mapped knowledge sets and species neural sets can just have the information popped into your head with a little magnetic induction on the right neurons. Good for basic learning on most topics. You want to learn Mandarin Chinese later?" Ching said with a smile in her voice. "Anyhow, I've set most of your controls to the closest analogue of an Evangelion. Weapons, some of the more exotic sensors, and the jump drives are slaved to my controls until we're clear a good distance and you're more prepped to handle them. The neural feedback system is getting a good read on your headset, and you're already synched. Take us out the bay doors to the left. Just start us running down the tunnel for now, and I'll talk you through transfiguration for flight ops."

"神经诱导学习系统。充分映射的知识集和物种神经集只需通过适当神经上的微弱磁诱导，信息便能直接传入你的大脑。适用于大多数主题的基础学习。你稍后想学普通话吗？" Ching 带着笑意说道。"不管怎样，我已经将你的大部分控制设置调整为最接近福音战士的模拟。武器、一些更奇特的传感器以及跳跃驱动器都暂时由我控制，直到我们远离足够距离，你更准备好处理它们。神经反馈系统正从你的头戴设备中获取良好读数，你已经同步了。带我们出左边的舱门。现在先让我们沿着隧道跑起来，我会指导你进行飞行操作的变形。"

"Roger," Asuka answered. A decade's worth of military and piloting training came back to her easily. "Beginning movement." She pushed the joysticks forward and thought through the motions of walking. The NAM-91T StarStrider answered her mental push readily, and she felt her 40 meter legs easily step forward. She rapidly reached the already opened entrance of the deep tunnel that led through the ships armor layers to the outside vacuum. A faint tickle at the back of her mind and a text popup at the bottom right of her HUD told her she'd passed through the atmosphere barrier at the edge of the bay. She pushed the mecha into a run. The speedometer in her HUD ticked up, up, up...300 kmh...400...500...she broke Mach 1 and kept accelerating. She was leaning well forward when she felt her feet leave the floor of the tunnel and saw the sides of the tunnel light up. Broad blue bands on the floor, walls and ceiling lit up, and she felt gravity rotate as 'down' became just another wall, and they started picking up even more speed. "Ching, this is supposed to be happening, right?"

"罗杰，"飞鸟回答道。十年的军事和驾驶训练轻易地回到了她的脑海中。"开始移动。"她推动操纵杆向前，脑海中模拟着行走的动作。NAM-91T 星际行者迅速响应了她的意念，她感受到自己那四十米长的双腿轻松地迈出了步伐。她迅速到达了已经打开的深邃隧道入口，这条隧道穿过飞船的装甲层，通向外部真空。脑海后方微微一颤，抬头显示器右下角弹出的文字提示她已穿过舱内的气压屏障。她将机甲推入奔跑状态。抬头显示器上的速度计不断攀升，300 公里/小时...400...500...她突破了音速，并持续加速。当她感觉到机甲的双脚离开隧道地面，看到隧道两侧亮起时，她已经大幅度前倾。地面、墙壁和天花板上的宽阔蓝色光带亮起，她感受到重力方向的旋转，"下方"变成了另一面墙，他们的速度更是急剧提升。"青，这应该是正常现象吧？"

Ching's face appeared in a small com window on the main display that extended from over her head to below her feet in a smooth arc in front of her. "You've got us moving fast enough the launch catapult has kicked in and it will do the rest. The armor layer is over 200km thick. Even running at top speed, it would take us a while. Hit the button marked 'F' in front of your left grip, and we'll start transfiguring to fighter mode. Visualize your legs folding back under your body and your arms extending into wings."

青的脸庞出现在主显示屏上的一个小通讯窗口中，该显示屏从她头顶延伸至脚底，呈流畅的弧形展现在她面前。“你已经让我们加速到足以启动发射弹射器的程度，剩下的它会自动完成。装甲层厚度超过 200 公里。即使全速前进，也需要一段时间。按下你左手握把前标记为‘F’的按钮，我们将开始转换为战斗机模式。想象你的双腿向后折叠至身体下方，双臂延伸成翅膀。”

Asuka hit the button, next to its mates marked 'B' and 'G'. She pushed with her mind again, and felt the mecha's shape begin to shift as it accelerated ever more. She felt the cockpit she was in roll forward as the mecha's legs folded back and what had been 'above' became 'forward'. The speedometer ticked past 2500 kmh and she was suddenly a huge falcon, flying down a blue-lit tunnel towards a speck of black. 3000...4000...10,000 kmh!

明日香按下了按钮，旁边标有'B'和'G'的同伴们。她再次用意念推动，感觉到机甲的形态开始变化，速度不断加快。她所在的驾驶舱向前滚动，机甲的双腿折叠回缩，原本的“上方”变成了“前方”。速度计指针划过 2500 公里/小时，她瞬间化作一只巨大的猎鹰，沿着蓝色照明的隧道向着一点黑色疾飞而去。3000...4000...10000 公里/小时！

They shot out of the planetoid's surface doing over 18,000 kmh and accelerating as Asuka's banshee howl of triumph filled the cockpit.

他们以超过 18,000 公里每小时的速度从行星表面射出，加速之际，阿苏卡胜利的尖啸充斥着驾驶舱。

Two hours later, Asuka felt like she was vibrating. 'This thing can move like lightning, strike like thunder, and can't be touched! Holy shit I want one!' Ching had released the weapons to her controls once they gotten clear of the ship and reached a small asteroid cluster. Ching started up a training program, and her HUD declared some of the asteroids as targets. Asuka brought her targeting reticule around and went to town. Unlike the Evangelion series, the StarStrider had a whole suite of integral weapons, from small lasers mounted on the 'head' of the mecha to forward facing anti-proton cannons in fighter mode. Ching told her that even bigger weapons were available for external mounts, like a plasma cannon longer than the mecha itself. She couldn't wait to try that one out. She'd spent a good forty five minutes blasting asteroid targets with increasingly faster maneuvers and stronger weapons. The defensive shields were not exactly like an AT-Field, but she could sense and push them just the same, and she could feel how strong they were. She'd blown up one asteroid with a plasma blast at point blank range, and the shields kept her from so much as a scorch mark.

两小时后，明日香感觉自己仿佛在颤动。'这玩意儿动如闪电，击如雷霆，触之不及！天啊，我真想拥有一台！'在远离飞船，抵达一小片小行星群后，青已经将武器控制权交给了她。青启动了一个训练程序，她的头盔显示器将一些小行星标记为目标。明日香调整瞄准框，开始大展身手。与福音战士系列不同，星际骑兵拥有一套完整的内置武器，从机甲'头部'的小型激光器到战斗机模式下的前向反质子炮。青告诉她，还有更大的武器可供外部挂载，比如比机甲本身还长的等离子炮。她迫不及待想尝试那一款。她花了四十五分钟，用越来越快的机动和更强大的武器轰击小行星目标。防御护盾虽不完全像 AT 力场，但她能感知并推动它们，感受到它们的强度。她曾用等离子炮在极近距离炸毁一颗小行星，护盾让她连一丝焦痕都未留下。

Ching had walked her through the steps and course for a speed run too. She'd bounced off 0.01c before she had to ramp it back down and turn around. Even the spirit animating the thing was fast and nimble, reacting to her mental commands like an eager puppy. Ching had said it was an AI, not a soul like in an Eva, but Asuka couldn't feel any difference. It lacked the welcoming, familiar feeling of synching to her mother's spirit in Unit-02, but was a whole lot better than the brain-damaged apathy of her current rebuilt Mass Production Eva.

青也指导她完成了速度跑的步骤和路线。她曾一度加速至 0.01 倍光速，但随后不得不减速并掉头。即便驱动这东西的精神体也敏捷异常，对她的意念指令反应迅速，如同一只热切的小狗。青曾说这是一个 AI，并非像 Eva 中那样的灵魂，但明日香感觉不出差别。它虽没有与二号机中母亲灵魂同步时的那种亲切熟悉感，却远胜于她当前那台重建的量产型 Eva 所表现出的脑损伤般的冷漠。

She'd finally shut down the weapons and turned the mecha back towards their launch point when Ching spoke up again.

她终于关闭了武器系统，将机甲调头朝向发射点，这时青又开口了。

"Asuka, I've shut down the external comms, and we're fifty thousand miles from anything. Nobody can hear us right now but the Lord and Lady, and they're going to be very much not listening to anything we say."

明日香，我已经关闭了外部通讯，我们现在距离任何地方都有五万英里。此刻除了主和夫人，没人能听见我们，而他们显然不会听我们说任何话。

"And why would we need that kind of solitude, Ching?" Asuka asked neutrally.

"我们为什么需要那种孤独，阿星？" 明日香中性地问道。

"Because I wanted to say some things to you that I don't think you'd want anyone else to hear." Ching's face in the comm screen was tight with concern. "I want to be your friend, Asuka, but I'm a doctor too, and I can't just shut that off when we talk. My specialization is in Childhood Trauma. His Majesty asked me to be a part of helping you and Shinji recover and acclimatize to the Empire because he thought you'd need a friend, and I'm a lot closer in age to you than he is, but also because I might be able to help you come to terms with some of the deepest scars you have."

因为我想对你说些话，我觉得你不会希望别人听到。屏幕上，Ching 的面容紧绷着关切。“我想成为你的朋友，Asuka，但我也是一名医生，我们交谈时我无法关闭这个身份。我的专长是儿童创伤。陛下让我参与帮助你和 Shinji 恢复并适应帝国，因为他认为你需要一个朋友，而且我比你和陛下的年龄更接近，也因为或许我能帮你面对一些最深的伤痕。”

"I've got my mother back. That will be more than enough for me for now." Asuka replied tensely.

"我找回了母亲。这对我来说，眼下已经足够了。" 明日香紧张地回答道。

"Losing your mother hurt you a lot, but more than that, to really heal yourself you're going to have to do something much harder."

失去母亲让你深受伤害，但要想真正治愈自己，你将不得不面对更艰难的挑战。

"I swear to Gott, if one more person tells me I have to be nicer to the Third Child, I'm going to find the self-destruct on this thing and push it."

我发誓，要是再有一个人告诉我得对老三好点，我就要找到这玩意儿的自毁按钮，然后按下去。

"Asuka, you're going to have to forgive yourself."

明日香，你必须原谅自己。

A tense silence filled the mecha's cockpit.

机甲驾驶舱内弥漫着紧张的沉默。

"What?" Asuka's voice was dangerously even.

"什么？" 明日香的声音异常平静，却暗藏危险。

Ching calmly met her eyes in the comm window. "I went through all the recordings and files on your world and the Angel War last night. That included all the strangeness of Instrumentality. So I've got a better look at the inside of your heart than anyone besides your closest lover should have. And I kept seeing one very harsh thing."

青平静地迎上了通讯窗口中她的目光。"昨晚我查看了你所在世界和天使战争的所有记录和文件，包括关于工具性的所有奇异之处。所以我对你内心的了解，除了你最亲密的爱人之外，无人能及。而我反复看到的是一件非常残酷的事情。"

"Do tell..." Asuka's tone was far less than welcoming. 'Gott damn it, Third Child, your fucking Instrumentality put my whole heart on display to the entire fucking universe. Thanks ever so much.'

"说来听听……" 明日香的语气绝非欢迎。'该死的，第三适格者，你那该死的补完计划把我的整个心都展示给了整个该死的宇宙。真是太感谢了。'

"Asuka, you hate yourself."

“明日香，你憎恨自己。”

Asuka's mouth dropped open. "I...I do not!" she hissed.

明日香的嘴巴张大了。“我……我没有！”她低声反驳。

"Deep down, the worst part of your heart hates yourself. The loss of your mother hit you when you weren't even four, and deep inside you concluded that if your mother doesn't want you, you must be a terrible person not deserving of love. You hate yourself for being unlovable, and you keep everyone away from your heart because you are utterly convinced that if anyone knew the 'real you' they'd agree you're as repulsive as you're convinced you are and leave you. You hate yourself for betraying yourself by giving up, both for wanting to die with your mother but still living. You hate yourself for failing as a Pilot, letting Shinji and even Ayanami surpass you towards the end of the war. You hate yourself for ever having gone to Winthrop, selling out another piece of your soul to keep on living. You hate yourself so much it made me weep last night, Asuka. Sweet Lord and Lady, I wish you'd let me or someone hug you."

内心深处，你最痛恨的是自己。母亲在你未满四岁时离世，那一刻你便认定，若母亲都不要你，你定是个不配被爱的可憎之人。你因自己的不可爱而憎恨自己，你将所有人拒之心门外，因为你坚信，一旦有人了解真实的你，便会如你所想，认为你令人厌恶至极并离你而去。你恨自己因放弃而背叛了自己，既渴望与母亲同逝却又苟活于世。你恨自己在战争末期作为驾驶员的失败，让真嗣甚至绫波都超越了你。你恨自己曾前往温思罗普，为了生存而出卖灵魂。你对自我的憎恨之深，令我昨夜为你落泪，明日香。仁慈的天地之神啊，我多么希望你能让我或他人拥抱你。

Asuka gave her only a frigid silence in return. Her glare through the comm window could have melted steel.

明日香回以她的是一片冰冷的沉默。她透过通讯窗口的目光，仿佛能将钢铁熔化。

"You have to forgive yourself, Asuka. You are not unlovable. You are brilliant, strong, fierce, you fought with your friends against terrible odds to protect your whole world...You're a hero, Asuka." Ching said sincerely. She worked at the mecha's controls for a moment. Asuka maintained her silence. "You're not unlovable. And I'm going to show you proof." Ching paused for a second, then highlighted something on the screen. The ship they'd launched from was swelling as they rapidly vectored towards it. "Look ahead. That's the ship we launched from..."

你必须原谅自己，明日香。你并非不可爱。你才华横溢，坚强勇敢，与朋友们并肩作战，面对重重困难，只为守护整个世界……你是英雄，明日香。”青木真诚地说道。她在机甲控制台上操作了一会儿，明日香依旧沉默不语。“你并非不可爱，我会向你证明。”青木停顿了一下，然后在屏幕上突出显示了某个东西。他们迅速向其靠近的那艘飞船正在逐渐变大。“看前面，那是我们出发的飞船……”

Asuka flicked her glare away from Lieutenant Leibshott to the display. The bronze planetoid grew from a dot to a ball to a globe as they swung closer. Closer, until she could make out an image and some letters on the hull. Given the size of the ship, the letters must have been scores of kilometers tall and broad. She could almost read them...And suddenly the image was clear to see.

明日香将目光从莱布斯霍特中尉身上移开，转向显示屏。随着他们逐渐靠近，那颗青铜色的天体从一个小点变成一个球体，再变成一个完整的地球仪。越来越近，直到她能辨认出船体上的图像和一些字母。考虑到飞船的尺寸，那些字母必定有数十公里高和宽。她几乎能读出它们……突然间，图像清晰可见。

It was her. The hull of the giant ship, bigger than Earth's moon, had a 1000 kilometer tall picture of her on it, wearing her old plugsuit, hair eternally streaming in the cosmic wind. The name was now easy to see, too.

是她。那艘巨舰的船体，比地球的月亮还要庞大，上面绘有一幅高达一千公里的她的画像，身着旧式插头服，头发在宇宙风中永恒飘扬。舰名此刻也清晰可见。

"...the HMS Asuka Langley Sohryu. A Hero-class planetoid, Hull Number 2HPN259, known to her crew as 'The Red Demon'. Her motto is 'I Will Fight Beyond Death'," Lieutenant Leibshott finished. "I told you your story was known here, Asuka. We have seen your heart, the 'real you', scars, flaws, and all...and we love you. You've got friends...you've got fans here, Asuka. There are literally tens of thousands of people on that ship alone who know everything your story can tell about you, and think you are wonderful. That's not my ship, I'm off the HMS Saragarhi, but I'm one of them too. You made it through so much alone. Now you'll never have to fight alone again, unless you want to."

“...HMS 飞鸟真嗣总流号。英雄级行星要塞，船体编号 2HPN259，其船员昵称为‘赤红恶魔’。她的座右铭是‘我将战斗至死不渝’，”莱布斯霍特中尉总结道。“我告诉过你，你的故事在这里广为人知，明日香。我们看到了你的内心，真实的你，带着伤痕与瑕疵...我们爱你。你有了朋友...你在这里有了粉丝，明日香。仅那艘船上就有数以万计的人了解你的故事所揭示的一切，并认为你非常出色。那不是我的船，我来自 HMS 萨拉加希号，但我也是其中一员。你曾独自经历了那么多。现在，你再也不用孤军奋战了，除非你愿意。”

Asuka blinked away the prickling feeling in her eyes. A few drips still made it down her cheeks. She made no attempt to fight the smile growing on her lips. She just kept staring at the gold-rimmed red letters stretching across the curve of the ship's hull. "'I Will Fight Beyond Death', huh?" she whispered. "Yeah, that's me. Dead and back again, still kicking."

明日香眨了眨眼，试图驱散眼中的刺痛感。仍有几滴泪水滑落脸颊。她没有抗拒嘴角逐渐扩大的笑容，只是继续凝视着船体曲线上那排金边红字。“'我将战斗至死而后生'，是吧？”她低语道，“没错，这就是我。死去又归来，依旧勇往直前。”

Ching spoke up again. "Shinji knows the 'real you' too. He saw everything in Instrumentality. He was there with you in the whole war, and every step since. The only time you and he have been apart since you met, the only time in almost six years is when Winthrop kept him on the other side of the world from you. He has seen every dark part of you, everything you think is a disqualification from ever being worthy of love, and he loves you even more. I think part of why you push him away so hard is because you know he's a good person, and you want him close, but you're even more afraid that because he is he'd hurt you even worse if or when he left you."

青又开口了：“真嗣也了解真正的你。他在人类补完计划中看到了一切。战争全程，以及之后的每一步，他都与你同在。自相遇以来，你们几乎六年未曾分离，唯一一次分开是温思罗将他留在世界的另一端。他见证了你内心所有的阴暗面，那些你认为使自己不配被爱的部分，而他却更加深爱着你。我想，你之所以如此强烈地推开他，部分原因在于你知道他是个好人，你渴望他靠近，但更害怕的是，正因为他是好人，一旦他离开，对你的伤害会更甚。”

"But I wasn't lying then, after the battle. I don't love him. I don't even think I can," Asuka finally whispered. "I don't know how." She felt cold.

但战后那时，我并未说谎。我不爱他。我甚至觉得我做不到，”明日香终于低声说道，“我不知道如何去爱。”她感到一阵寒意。

"You do, you don't...you won't be able to do either fully until and unless you let go of at least some of what you've got wrapped up inside you. If you hate yourself, you'll never believe deep inside that anyone else could love you. You don't love him, maybe, but you still hate the idea of him not being near you. You won't let yourself make a commitment one way or the other if you can't forgive yourself. When you have, you'll find the other side is wide open. So much freedom it can be scary, but you can leave the pain behind. And you can face that fear." Ching laughed. "Fear, heh. The motto all Imperial Armed Forces as a whole is something we all take to heart, a truth and a magic chant that gives us strength in dark places. You can use it too, Asuka."

你做，你不做...直到你放下内心深处的一些包袱，你才能完全做到其中任何一种。如果你憎恨自己，你内心深处永远不会相信有人能爱你。你可能不爱他，但仍然讨厌他不在你身边的想法。如果你不能原谅自己，你就不会让自己做出任何承诺。当你做到时，你会发现另一边是敞开的。如此多的自由，可能会让人害怕，但你可以将痛苦抛在身后。你可以面对那种恐惧。”青笑了。“恐惧，呵呵。整个帝国武装部队的座右铭是我们都铭记于心的，一个真理和一个在黑暗中给予我们力量的咒语。你也可以使用它，飞鸟。”

"I hope it's better than 'God's In His Heaven, All's Right With The World'. What is it?"

我希望它比“上帝在他的天堂，世界一切安好”更好。是什么呢？

"Illic Non Est Quod Timor."

那里无须畏惧。

Asuka's brow knitted. Her Latin was rusty, but..."There is no... thing that is...fear?" she attempted.

明日香的眉头紧锁。她的拉丁语已经生疏，但……“没有……什么东西是……恐惧？”她尝试着翻译。

"There Is No Such Thing As Fear." Ching agreed.

"没有所谓的恐惧。" 青同意道。

"There is no such thing as fear..." Asuka slowly echoed.

"没有所谓的恐惧这种东西……" 明日香缓缓地重复道。

"Keep that in your mind, and there won't be anything you can't do. There Is No Such Thing As Fear, the gods are on your side, and an Empire has your back. You're the Great Asuka Langley Sohryu. Nothing can stop you. Nothing but you."

铭记此言，你将无所不能。世上无惧，神明庇佑，帝国为盾。你是伟大的飞鸟·兰利·明日香。无物可阻，唯你自限。

"You say it like it's so easy."

你说得好像很容易似的。

"Very little worthwhile ever is, Asuka. But you've got all the backup you could ever want. Don't be afraid of the possibility of pain when you're already hurting. The other side is free."

值得的东西很少是轻易得来的，明日香。但你拥有你想要的一切支持。当你已经在痛苦中时，不要害怕疼痛的可能性。另一边是自由的。

Asuka tugged at the joysticks and brought the mecha to a halt hanging in front of her gigantic portrait. "The other side...may not be there. The Third Child is...he...he's with me because I gave up, and he's too withdrawn to ever find anyone for himself. He's the only person left who understands what I went through. He's just desperate for company like I am. He's just hanging around me because he doesn't know anything else to do and no one has told him to do anything." 'You're just two depressed grown-ups licking each other's wounds.' Her own ancient mockery of Misato's erratic relationship with Kaji echoed harshly in her mind. Gott, she hated that little fifteen-year-old bitch now.

明日香拉扯着操纵杆，让机甲停在了她巨大的肖像前。“另一边……可能并不存在。第三适格者……他……他和我在一起是因为我放弃了，而他太过内向，永远无法为自己找到任何人。他是唯一一个理解我所经历的人。他和我一样，只是渴望陪伴。他只是在我周围徘徊，因为他不知道还能做什么，也没有人告诉他该做什么。”‘你们只是两个沮丧的成年人互相舔舐伤口。’她对美里与加持间不稳定关系的古老嘲讽，在她脑海中刺耳地回响。天哪，她现在讨厌那个十五岁的小婊子。

"And yet you threatened to quit Piloting and go on strike if you weren't allowed to go with him on the South America mission? He may have said he knows 'that boat has sailed', but knowing something intellectually and knowing it in your gut can be very far apart sometime. He was...you know how much he hates the idea of killing, how much he hated the entire idea of being a Pilot? He was still ready to volunteer to partake in Jinnai's coup because the world he'd been responsible for was driving you to suicide. He may have intellectually accepted the idea, or at least become resigned to the fact you don't love him, but he still...always looks at you."

然而，你曾威胁要放弃驾驶并举行罢工，如果不允许你随他执行南美任务？他或许会说“那艘船已经起航”，但理智上的认知与内心的感受有时相去甚远。他……你知道他多么厌恶杀戮，多么憎恶成为驾驶员的想法吗？他仍愿意自愿参与神无的政变，因为那个他所负责的世界正将你推向自杀的边缘。他可能在理智上接受了这一观念，或至少对“你不爱他”这一事实感到无奈，但他仍然……始终注视着你。

"'Looks at me'?" Asuka asked, puzzled.

"‘看着我’？" 明日香困惑地问道。

"Haven't you noticed? I'm a D-cup and easy on the eyes, I know. And the Empress, woof! I'm mostly straight and she makes me reach for the ice water and a fan. But the whole time he's been around all of us...he only ever looks at you. If I didn't talk to get his attention, I don't think he'd even notice I was there. I mean, come on, the Lord flies in and greets him personally, the Lady appears before him in a sky-high column of fire...and within less than a minute his eyes are back on you! He didn't even remember I was there until I said something. There's no one else."

你没发现吗？我可是 D 罩杯，长得也挺养眼，这我知道。至于皇后，哇，我虽大多时候直得像根棍，但她让我都忍不住要找冰水和扇子来降温。可他自从来到我们中间，自始至终，目光只落在你一个人身上。要不是我开口吸引他的注意，他恐怕根本察觉不到我的存在。说真的，主神亲自降临向他问好，女神以冲天火柱之姿出现在他面前……不到一分钟，他的视线又回到了你身上！直到我出声，他才想起我也在场。除了你，没有别人。

Asuka was silent for a long time, staring at her giant self on the hull. "I...we've been like this too long. I'm still yelling at him and hurting him like we were both still fourteen. I don't even mean to say it half the time. And he always says exactly the wrong thing. It's worse now, really, since we've both got so many hideous memories we both know all about to pound each other on, things we shared whether we wanted to or not in Instrumentality," she finally said. "I don't even know where to start."

明日香沉默良久，凝视着船体上自己巨大的影像。“我……我们这样已经太久了。我还是像我们十四岁时那样对他大吼大叫，伤害他。很多时候我甚至不是故意的。而他总是说出最不合时宜的话。现在更糟了，真的，因为我们都有那么多不堪回首的记忆，彼此都了如指掌，可以用来互相攻击，那些我们在人类补完计划中无论愿不愿意都共同经历的事情。”她终于开口说道，“我甚至不知道该从何开始。”

"Start small. Even little steps can add up. And one of the little steps might be the snowflake that starts the avalanche. Apologize for something. Let him do the same. Forgive him something. Forgive yourself something. A regret, a sin, a missed chance, something." Ching hesitated for a second, but continued. "If you two are... undounamata's are often drawn to each other, for years, against all circumstances. If you two really are such for each other, it can be a source of unlimited strength. You won't believe how strong you can feel, when you know, utterly and beyond all doubt that that person has your back, no matter what. The win is worth the risk. I'm your friend, Asuka. I want you to be happy. Take the chance."

从小处着手。即使小步也能积少成多。而其中的一小步可能就是引发雪崩的那片雪花。为某事道歉。让他也这么做。宽恕他某件事。宽恕自己某件事。一个遗憾，一个罪过，一次错过的机会，某件事。"青犹豫了一秒，但继续说道。"如果你们俩是……undounamata 往往会被彼此吸引，多年如此，不顾一切环境。如果你们俩真的是彼此的 undounamata，那可以成为无穷力量的源泉。你不会相信，当你确信无疑地知道那个人无论如何都会支持你时，你能感受到多么强大。胜利值得冒险。我是你的朋友，飞鸟。我希望你幸福。抓住这个机会。

Ching twisted her own controls and brought the communications suite back online. "Red Crown 1 to Sohryu flight ops, we're ready for recovery."

青调整了自己的控制装置，重新启动了通讯系统。“红冠一号呼叫苏儒飞行指挥中心，我们已做好回收准备。”

"Enjoying ogling our gorgeous hull emblem, Red Crown 1? Opening the hull port. Lock on to beacon gamma-791 and follow it in."

欣赏我们华丽的船体徽章，红冠一号？正在打开船体舱门。锁定信标伽马-791 并跟随它进入。

"Roger." She started the mecha moving again and closed the channel. "In the meantime, Asuka, think of all the fun you could have playing with Shinji's head. He'll have no idea what you're up to, and probably wouldn't believe it even if he did. Relax and have fun."

"收到。" 她重新启动了机甲，并关闭了通讯频道。"与此同时，明日香，想想你可以如何尽情捉弄真嗣。他根本猜不到你的意图，即便猜到了，恐怕也不会相信。放轻松，好好享受吧。"

"You want me to reach out the Third by messing with him?" Asuka asked with more than a little disbelief.

"你想让我通过招惹他来接近第三个人？" 明日香带着不止一点的不信问道。

"Why not? You used to. You had some of your best moments back during the Angel War when you were teasing and flirting with him. Remember how much you blew his mind with your little 'Thermal Expansion' demo?" Ching grinned. "Just tease him a little. You'll be in your comfort zone, he may recall better days, and he'll never see you coming."

为什么不呢？你以前常这么做。在天使战争期间，你和他调情逗趣，那可是你最美好的时光。还记得你用那个小小的“热膨胀”演示让他多么震惊吗？”青笑着说，“稍微逗逗他。你会感到自在，他或许会回忆起美好的日子，而且他绝对预料不到你的举动。”

"I did a lot of bitchy hurting of him that way too. I doubt he'd appreciate that reminder."

我也曾那样刻薄地伤害过他，我怀疑他不会愿意回忆起这些。

Ching gave a little shrug. "So keep it light and be careful. Having a goal should keep you more on target."

青轻轻耸了耸肩，“那就保持轻松，小心行事。有个目标应该能让你更专注。”

Asuka was still thinking hard in silence as they hit the launch tunnel and the catapult slowed them down for landing.

当他们进入发射隧道，弹射器减缓速度准备着陆时，明日香仍在默默地苦苦思索。

### Chapter 10 Apologies & Promises
歉意与承诺

Two hours after their own launch, Shinji felt like his brain had been strung on a line and was bouncing around in their wake. Asuka had whipped the NAM-91T through a hair-raisingly breakneck set of maneuvers around and through an asteroid cluster, blasting some of the rocks with the bewildering array of weapons built into the mecha itself and with a huge rifle-like gunpod in the mecha's right hand.

两小时后，真嗣感觉自己的大脑仿佛被悬挂在一条线上，随着他们的尾迹颠簸不已。明日香驾驶 NAM-91T 在小行星群中穿梭，进行了令人心惊肉跳的极速机动，不仅利用机甲内置的多种武器，还用机甲右手握持的巨大枪械型枪炮轰击了部分小行星。

Unlike the tired apathy he felt when they cooperated to synch with the MP Eva they had now, this machine's animating spirit practically leaped to follow their commands. Even stranger, Shinji had a much clearer feeling of Asuka through the link than he'd ever had before. She felt...red, unsurprisingly, and spiky, hot. At the same time he somehow got the impression that she was...fencing with him? Pushing against him, drawing back, pressing against his will through the link.

与之前与 MP Eva 同步时的疲惫冷漠截然不同，这台机体仿佛灵动非凡，几乎是一跃而起，紧随他们的指令。更奇异的是，通过链接，真嗣对明日香的感知异常清晰。她给他的感觉是……红色，这并不出奇，而且尖锐、炽热。同时，他隐约觉得她仿佛在和他……击剑？她通过链接与他对抗，时而退却，时而压迫他的意志。

'What the hell,' he wondered. 'Is she...flirting with my brain?' She certainly was in speech. The entire two hours had been a string of double entendres, snarky remarks at his own attempts at piloting the mecha, and crowing over her own admittedly much superior performance. Shinji felt like he was in free fall in more ways than one. The Asuka he'd fallen asleep next to yesterday had been an angry, tired, bitter shell, hating what was left of her life and yet still fearful of losing what little she had. This Asuka was... on fire. A headlong ball of confidence and spirit, the girl who'd been his wingman in the Angel War.

'他不禁疑惑：“这到底是怎么回事，她难道在……跟我玩脑内暧昧？”她的言辞确实如此。整整两个小时，她不断抛出双关语，对他的机甲操控尝试冷嘲热讽，并得意地夸耀自己明显更出色的表现。真嗣感觉自己在多重意义上都像是自由落体。昨天还睡在旁边的明日香，是个愤怒、疲惫、充满怨恨的空壳，既憎恨着残存的生活，又害怕失去仅剩的一点东西。而眼前的明日香……却热情似火。她自信满满、充满活力，是那个在天使战争中与他并肩作战的女孩。'

What the Hell had gone on with her in six damn hours?

短短六个小时内，她究竟遭遇了什么？

The worst part is now he felt like he was twisting in the wind. He didn't know who to react to now; the bitter, fragile, and tired woman he'd been about to board the fleet with, or the wild and confident girl who was hot dogging all over space in her new toy. All his post-Third Impact inner vows to protect her felt foolish to apply to the balls-to-the-wall Pilot who was currently turning asteroids into gravel with rapid-fire plasma blasts while zooming past at 500,000 kmh.

最糟糕的是，他现在感觉自己像是被风吹得无所适从。他不知道该如何面对眼前的人：是那个苦涩、脆弱、疲惫，即将与他一同登舰的女人，还是那个在太空中驾驶新玩具四处狂飙、自信满满的女孩。在第三次冲击后，他曾发誓要保护她，但现在面对这位以每小时 50 万公里的速度穿梭，用快速发射的等离子束将小行星化为碎石的无所畏惧的飞行员，这些誓言显得愚蠢至极。

Not to mention the fact his parents were now waiting back on Avalon, his dad might go crazy...-er, and he had a completely inexplicable date tonight. With Asuka? She'd said it wasn't that sort of date, but what the heck was it then? He'd thought last night had been strange.

更别提他的父母此刻正在阿瓦隆焦急等待，他的父亲可能都要急疯了...-呃，而且他今晚还有个完全摸不着头脑的约会。和明日香？她之前说这不是那种约会，那到底是什么意思呢？他觉得昨晚已经够离奇了。

One last asteroid blown to shards, and Asuka shut down the weapons. She did not send the mecha blasting off towards any new destination immediately afterwards, though. Shinji could see her shifting her eyes around through the comm window, but for a long moment she didn't say anything. He watched her take a deep breath and mutter something to herself, then finally meet his eyes.

最后一颗小行星炸裂成碎片，明日香随即关闭了武器。她并未立刻操纵机甲前往新的目的地。通过通讯窗口，真嗣注意到她眼神飘忽，沉默良久。他见她深吸一口气，低声自语，最终目光与他交汇。

"I've shut off the radio, and we're a million miles from anyone, Third. Only the gods can hear us up here, and they're not supposed to be listening in. So... this is... just between us, got it?" she rattled of tensely.

"我已关闭收音机，我们身处无人之境，相隔百万里，第三。唯有神明能在此处聆听，但他们不应偷听。因此...这番话...仅限于你我之间，懂了吗？"她紧张而急促地说道。

"Okay?" Shinji agreed. To what, he wasn't sure.

"好的？" 真嗣应声道，至于具体是什么，他心里也没底。

"I... I'm... sorry for that crack about Misato not being sober," she mumbled.

"我...我为之前说美里可能没醒酒的话道歉，"她低声说道。

"What?" That had been hard to hear, and even harder to believe it could be what he thought it sounded like.

"什么？" 那声音难以听清，更难以相信那竟是他所猜想的意思。

"I'm sorry about that crack I made about Misato, baka... when I was showing you around the Berlin NERV base. I... just said it to get under your skin. You were... I didn't like all the attention you were getting as 'the new Eva Pilot slash Great Hero' and I wanted to take you down a peg and make you pay attention to me. So I'm sorry," Asuka spit out in one long breath and looked away.

"对于之前在柏林 NERV 基地带你参观时，我拿美里开玩笑的事，真的很抱歉，笨蛋...我那么做只是想激怒你。你...我不喜欢你作为'新 EVA 驾驶员兼大英雄'受到那么多关注，我想让你降降温，让你注意到我。所以，对不起，" 明日香一口气说完，然后转过头去。

Shinji stared at her. The background hum of the mecha's life support systems was the only sound. "...Who are you and what have you done with the Asuka I came here with?"

真嗣凝视着她，四周唯有机甲生命维持系统低沉的嗡鸣声。"...你究竟是谁？你把跟我一起来的明日香弄到哪里去了？"

"What the fuck are you talking about, Third? I'm trying to apologize here!" Asuka growled.

"你到底在说什么，第三？我正努力在这里道歉！" 明日香怒吼道。

'And that's way out of line for the Asuka I know. Who the heck am I talking to?' Shinji wondered. But having no reason besides his own confusion to reject it..."I... um... thank you, Asuka. I..." Crap, confusion wasn't a good reason to reject it, but now he had even less idea of how to respond. "...I don't know what to say."

'这完全不像我所了解的明日香。我究竟在和谁对话？' 碇真嗣心中疑惑。然而，除了自己的困惑外，并无其他理由拒绝..."我...呃...谢谢你，明日香。我..." 意识到仅凭困惑拒绝并不妥当，他更加茫然，不知如何作答。"...我真不知道该说什么好。"

"You could try forgiving me, Third Child."

你不妨试着原谅我，三少爷。

Shinji almost asked 'why?', but held himself. She'd sounded actually uncomfortable in making the apology, it was out of character, and she'd gone to some trouble to make it when they were in a place that no one could possibly overhear them, all of which suggested it was genuine. That only made it even more confounding. "I...forgive you, Asuka. I know she still meant something to you too."

真嗣差点脱口而出“为什么？”，却还是克制住了。明日香道歉时的语气明显带着尴尬，这并不像她的作风，而且她特意挑选了一个绝不会有人偷听的场合来表达歉意，这一切都暗示着她的诚意。这反而更令人费解。“我……原谅你了，明日香。我明白她对你同样重要。”

For an instant, Asuka flinched in the comm window. 'Was that because it wasn't true, or because it was and you just now are feeling it?' But her gaze quickly steadied and she looked at him expectantly. It was kind of unnerving. "What?"

刹那间，明日香在通讯窗口中微微一缩。'这是否因为那并非事实，或者因为那是事实，而你此刻才有所感触？'然而，她的眼神迅速恢复坚定，满怀期待地注视着他。这让人感到有些不安。"怎么了？"

Her eyes narrowed. "Well? It's your turn," she said sharply.

她目光一紧，催促道：“该你了，快说。”

"Um...my turn for what?" 呃...我该做什么？

"To apologize, baka!" 快道歉，你这个笨蛋！

"Uhh…For what?" Shinji mentally scrabbled for anything to grab on to.

"呃…这是为什么？" 真嗣在心里急忙寻找可以抓住的任何线索。

"Pick something!" Asuka said angrily. "I stuck myself out there first, now you should too!"

挑点东西吧！" 明日香怒气冲冲地说，"我先站出来了，现在你也该行动了！

"I'm sorr-..." Damn it. For once his reflexive habit of apologizing was at the same time exactly what he should say and the last thing he should say. "I... I don't know what to say, Asuka. Every other time I tell you 'I'm sorry', you say I make you sick."

我……真是抱歉……" 该死。他习惯性的道歉这次既是他该说的，也是最不该说的。"我……我不知道该说什么好，明日香。每次我对你说'对不起'，你都说我让你感到恶心。

That actually seemed to take her back a notch. She visibly throttled her anger. "Well, this time I'm asking you to, so go ahead. Find something you want to actually tell me you're sorry about. It's the way you fold and apologize for every time you so much as sneeze that bugs me."

那似乎真的让她退了一步。她明显地抑制住了怒火。"好吧，这次是我让你这么做的，开始吧。找一件你真心觉得需要向我道歉的事情。你每次稍微有点小错就急忙道歉，这让我很烦。"

"I..." Shinji wracked his brain furiously...and came up empty. 'Shit. What do I want to ask her forgiveness fo-' It hit him. Something that he'd wanted to apologize about for the last four years. 'Fuck it. 'I' told myself 'be honest and be there for her'. Might as well swing for the upper deck.'

"我..." 真嗣拼命地思索着...却毫无头绪。'该死。我究竟想为哪件事向她道歉呢-' 突然，他意识到了。那是他四年来一直想道歉的事情。'豁出去了。我告诉自己'要真诚，要支持她'。索性放手一搏，争取最好的结果。'

"I'm sorry for...failing you. When you were fighting the Mass Production Series, I should have gotten into the Entry Plug and tried to do something, but I didn't even do that. I've made Eva Unit-01 move before when it shouldn't have been able to, but I was falling apart from losing Misato and Kaworu and Rei and you...and when I should have tried anything to save the last person alive in the world who meant something to me, I just... gave up. I should have tried. I failed you. I'm sorry, Asuka. I'm so sorry. Reaching the surface and seeing what my failure had cost you broke me. That's why I wrotethat note. You were going crazy from seeing you mother taken away from you again, and I couldn't stand it. I wasn't going stand there and not do something when I could have helped you again. I tried to talk to you, but you just reminded me of how I should have done something before. I wasn't going to fail you again. I was going to take responsibility for what I'd done and failed to do in the past, and I was going to go to Jinnai to tell him that I was ready to do anything he needed as long as you didn't get hurt. I would do anything to take your pain away. I wasn't going to fail you again. Not again. Never again."

我为...让你失望而深感歉意。当你与量产机型激战时，我本应挺身而出，尝试有所作为，但我却袖手旁观。我曾让本不该动弹的初号机动起来，但失去了美里、薰、丽和你之后，我心力交瘁...而当我本应竭尽全力去拯救世界上最后一个对我有意义的人时，我却...选择了放弃。我本应尝试的。我辜负了你。对不起，明日香。真的非常对不起。当我抵达地面，目睹我的失败给你带来的沉重代价，我彻底崩溃了。这就是我留下那张纸条的原因。你因再次失去母亲而陷入疯狂，我无法坐视不管。我不能只是站在那里，当我本可以再次伸出援手时却无动于衷。 我曾试图与你沟通，然而你却让我意识到，我本应在之前有所行动。我决心不再辜负你。我将为自己的过往行为及其缺失负责，并打算去见神无井，表明我愿意为他做任何事，只要能确保你安然无恙。我愿竭尽所能，只为减轻你的痛苦。我绝不允许自己再次让你失望。绝不再有，永不再有。"

A long, long silence filled the mecha. Shinji felt panic slowly starting to rise in him. 'Oh shit oh shit oh shit did I say too much?' He tried to swallow with a throat gone suddenly bone dry.

机甲内弥漫着长久的沉默，真嗣感到恐慌在心中悄然蔓延。'糟糕，糟糕，糟糕，我是不是说得太多了？' 他试图吞咽，却发现喉咙突然干得像骨头一样。

"Damn you, Ikari...you were supposed to start small." Asuka's voice was like ash. Her eyes were invisible behind her hanging bangs.

"该死的碇，你本该从点滴做起。"明日香的声音沙哑无力，她的双眼被垂落的刘海遮掩，无法看见。

"I'm done with small, Asuka. Me trying to be small is what got us the world we had. I always tried to curl up in a ball and shut out the whole world, like it would stop bothering me if I was small enough. I'm done. I got to see my mother today for the first time since I was three years old. I got to punch my father in his stupid face. If this is a dream or I'm going crazy or whatever, I'm going to take advantage of it. This is my chance to undo some of the damage I did by being small. I'm going to take it."

我已厌倦了渺小，明日香。正是我一味追求渺小，才让我们陷入了那样的世界。我总是想把自己缩成一团，与世隔绝，好像只要我足够渺小，世界就不会再来打扰我。现在，我受够了。今天，我自三岁后首次见到了母亲。我狠狠地给了父亲那张愚蠢的脸一拳。如果这只是一场梦，或者我疯了，无论怎样，我都要利用这个机会。这是我弥补因渺小而造成的伤害的时机。我不会放过。

Shinji stopped himself as his voice began to rise. His heart was hammering in his chest. 'Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid,' hammered counterpoint in his head. He had a growing sense that he'd flown way off whatever script Asuka had been running on, but the last day's worth of events had pushed him way off balance. But, Hell, if he was off balance, he was going to run with it. He was way over the cliff now, might as well start flapping and hope for a soft landing. Asuka had already gotten as mad at him as possible the night of the coup. He could hardly do worse than then if he made her mad again. "Asuka, my failure got you killed. It's only by a miracle that I can talk to you now. Then you got shot during the coup... I can't see you hurt because of me again. I can't... it destroyed me once. I ended the whole world it hurt so much. So I'm never going to let myself just sit there when could help you again. I don't know if you can forgive me, but I'm sorry I let you down anyway."

真嗣抑制住自己声音的升高，心跳如鼓点般在胸中敲击。'别害怕。别害怕。别害怕。' 这句反调在他脑海中不断回响。他意识到自己已完全偏离了明日香原本的计划，过去一天的事件让他彻底失衡。然而，既然已经失衡，他决定顺势而为。既然已经跳下悬崖，不如挥动双臂，期待一个软着陆。在政变之夜，明日香已对他怒火中烧。如果他再次惹怒她，情况也不会更糟。"明日香，是我的失误导致了你的死亡。现在我能与你对话，简直是奇迹。接着你在政变中遭到枪击... 我不能再让你因我而受伤。我做不到..." 它曾一度将我击垮。我因无法承受那剧痛，甚至毁灭了整个世界。因此，我不会再坐视不管，当有机会再次助你一臂之力时。我不确定你是否能宽恕我，但我仍要为辜负了你而深表歉意。"

Shinji found himself almost panting when he finally ran down. "I... even if it had been futile, I should have tried. I can't abandon you like that again, Asuka. So I won't. Ever."

真嗣跑下楼时，几乎喘不过气来。"我...即便明知徒劳，我也该去尝试。我不能再那样抛弃你了，明日香。所以，我绝不会再这么做。"

Shinji hung his head low and to the side, so he almost missed Asuka's twitch at his last words. He couldn't identify the intense look in her eyes as she raised her head to lock eyes with him, but he couldn't break away. She had him pinned as effectively as if she'd nailed him to the wall.

真嗣垂头侧目，差点没注意到明日香在他最后那句话时的微颤。她抬头凝视他，眼中闪烁着难以名状的强烈情感，让他无法移开视线。她仿佛用钉子将他钉在墙上，牢牢掌控着他。

"Do you swear, Third?" she grated, her stare cold and hard. "You've got my back, no matter what?"

你敢发誓吗，第三？"她语气严厉，目光如冰。"无论发生什么，你都会站在我这边吗？

Shinji swallowed. "Y-yes. I swear. No matter what." The cockpit was evenly cool, but he felt a trail of sweat trickling down his temple. It took all of his will to keep looking her in the eye.

真嗣咽了咽口水，说道：“是、是的，我发誓，无论如何。”尽管驾驶舱内温度适宜，他仍感到汗水沿着太阳穴缓缓流下。他竭尽全力，才勉强直视她的眼睛。

Asuka held his gaze for a long moment. "Fine," she said, finally looking away. "I... I can't forgive you, Shinji. Not yet."

明日香久久地凝视着他，最终移开目光，说道：“好吧，我...我现在还无法原谅你，真嗣。”

"You don't have to, Asuka. My inaction hurt you. Until I can make it right, I don't even feel like you should forgive me."

明日香，你无需勉强。我的沉默伤害了你。在我能弥补过错之前，我甚至认为你不应该轻易原谅我。

"It cost me my life, Third. That's going to be hard to 'make right'," she said almost dryly.

"这让我赔上了性命，Third。要'弥补'这个损失，可不容易，"她近乎冷淡地说道。

"Then I'll have to do something just as good. I was ready that night. If my life would save yours, I was ready to give it," Shinji said softly.

"那么，我也得做出同样出色的行动。那天夜里，我已做好准备。若我的生命能换取你的安全，我随时准备献出。" 碇真嗣轻声说道。

"Stop being such a fucking martyr, Third," she said, but softly. She shook herself, and kicked the mecha into motion again. A little of her previous brash attitude crept back into her voice. "We've got a dinner appointment to make tonight. No getting yourself killed when I still have need of you." She lined the mecha's nose back up where they'd come from and kicked in the jump drive. The stars blurred around them as they instantly accelerated.

"别再做这种无谓的牺牲了，第三，" 她轻声说道。她摇了摇头，再次启动机甲。之前那种鲁莽的态度又悄然回到了她的声音中。"我们今晚还有个晚餐约会。在我还需要你的时候，别轻易送命。" 她将机甲的头部重新对准来时的方向，启动了跳跃驱动器。星星在他们周围变得模糊，因为他们瞬间加速了。

"I'll be right here as long as you need me, Asuka."

只要你需要，我就会一直在这里，明日香。

She just humphed at that, and steered them back to their launch point. A short, silence-filled flight later the bronze hull of the ship they'd flown from an hour ago hove into view on Shinji's screen. He saw Asuka's guarded, neutral expression shift back into a grin. "Check this out, Third. Take a good look at the ship."

她对此只是轻哼一声，随即引导他们返回出发点。经过一段短暂的沉默飞行，一小时前他们搭乘的那艘船的青铜色船身再次映入真嗣的眼帘。他注意到明日香那原本警惕而中立的表情，又转变成了笑容。“瞧瞧这个，第三。仔细看看这艘船。”

Shinji tried to play with the controls for some sort of zoom function, but Asuka swept them in closer before he got very far. There were English letters across the hull and some kind of image, but they were all upside-down. But that image couldn't possibly be what he thought...

真嗣尝试操控控制器，想利用缩放功能，但阿苏卡抢先一步将画面拉近。船体上印有英文字母和某种图案，可惜全是倒置的。然而，那图案绝不可能是他心中所想的那般...

Asuka noted the same problem and rolled the mecha over. The letters were abruptly readable, and the image was now unmistakable... An enormous image of a plugsuited Pilot grinned back at him from underneath huge letters reading HMS Asuka Langley Sohryu. "Isn't that the greatest thing you've ever seen, Third?" she said proudly. "At least these Imperials seem to appreciate me properly."

明日香同样发现了这个问题，随即翻转了机甲。字母顿时清晰起来，图像也变得一目了然...一个巨大的插电式飞行员形象，下方赫然写着“HMS 明日香·兰格雷·惣流”，正咧嘴笑着回望他。“这难道不是你见过的最棒的东西吗，第三？”她自豪地说。“至少这些帝国人似乎真的懂得欣赏我。”

Shinji goggled for a minute. At last he rallied to ask quietly, "Is... is there an HMS Shinji Ikari?"

真嗣凝视了一会儿，终于鼓起勇气，轻声问道：“是不是有一艘叫 HMS 真嗣·碇的船？”

Asuka shrugged. "I didn't ask. After we landed, there was a huge crowd in the launch bay to welcome me back, and that's when they gave me this beautiful baby we're in now and the training course to fly it. They'd even painted it the right color! Right after that, Daniel showed back up, and we jumped back six hours to meet up with you and I hit your dad in the head. Which, by the way, felt great. I can't wait to do it again, maybe with a mallet. I guess that means that right now they still haven't given me this mecha until later... weird. Anyhow, it's time to park this wonderful toy of mine and get back to our cabin. I'm starting to feel like a nap."

明日香耸耸肩：“我没多问。我们着陆后，一大群人在发射舱迎接我，那时他们给了我这架漂亮的机甲，还有驾驶培训。他们甚至按我的喜好涂了色！紧接着，丹尼尔回来了，我们一起跳回六小时前与你汇合，我还打了你爸的头。说真的，那感觉太爽了，真想再来一次，或许下次用个木槌。看来现在他们还没把机甲给我，得到后面才给……挺奇怪的。总之，该把这宝贝停好，回舱休息了。我都有点想打个盹了。”

Shinji carefully sawed his bow through the Adagio of Beethoven's Cello Sonata No. 1 in F Major and tried to think. The deep notes of his instrument calmed him, but his thoughts kept going in erratic circles.

真嗣细心地拉动弓弦，演奏着贝多芬 F 大调第一大提琴奏鸣曲中的柔板，试图集中思绪。大提琴深沉的音色让他感到宁静，然而他的思绪依旧飘忽不定。

His mother was alive. He'd been in her arms this morning, for the first time that he could remember. His father...well, Shinji was less glad that he was alive as much as just slightly amazed he wasn't dead. Venting some of his sixteen years of anger and pain into his father's nose had felt better than he'd have thought. Now his father had his mother back, but had to face both her and the rest of the world's judgment of the legion of sins he had committed in the name of getting her back, a plan that had ultimately been futile until Rayana had given him what was divine intervention in all but name. Did that make those sins worse for being in the end pointless? On the other hand, success would hardly have redeemed them if all that had meant was his mother and father's being able to see each other again. Such a reunion built on a mountain of bodies and treachery would be a mountain for Hell, not Heaven.

他的母亲尚在人世。今早，他首次记得自己曾在母亲的怀抱中。至于父亲...真嗣与其说是因他活着而高兴，不如说是对他未死感到些许惊讶。将十六年的愤怒与痛苦倾泻在父亲的鼻子上，感觉比预想的还要畅快。如今父亲虽与母亲重逢，却不得不面对她及世人对他为寻回她而犯下诸多罪行的审判，这一计划本已注定徒劳，直到雷亚娜近乎神迹般的介入。这些罪行是否因最终的无意义而更显深重？ 另一方面，若成功仅意味着他的父母能重聚，这样的成功几乎无济于事。建立在众多牺牲与背叛之上的团圆，是地狱的堆积，而非天堂的景象。

And getting his mother back had been his father's obsessive goal for over a decade. He'd built his whole life around that aim. What would he be like with that fixation gone? Would he regret any of it? Would there be the slightest remorse from the man for essentially throwing away the life of everyone else in his path including his own son for the chance to be with his mother again? Without remorse, what if his mother decided that what he had done made her turn him away? Would his father fall apart?

十多年来，父亲一心只想让母亲回到身边，生活完全围绕这一目标展开。若这执念消散，他将何去何从？是否会心生悔意？为了与母亲重聚，他牺牲了包括儿子在内的所有人，对此他是否会有半点悔恨？若无悔意，万一母亲因他所为而决绝，父亲是否会因此崩溃？

His grip on the bow tightened as a darker thought struck Shinji; what would he say to them if his mother didn't reject what his father had done? Would he even want to see her then? He hated the idea of having her alive, but not being someone he'd want to be around.

真嗣握弓的手越发用力，一个阴暗的念头突然袭来：如果母亲没有拒绝父亲的行为，他该如何面对他们？那时，他还会想见她吗？他无法接受母亲虽活着，却成了他不愿接近的人。

And Asuka...what had happened to her this morning? She'd smiled at him on the beach at dawn in a way that broke his heart when he watched in collapse into confusion and loss. He'd been a heartbeat away from reaching out to touch her when she turned away. And yet she'd been so much more... bright, fiery like her old self after retrieving her mother and 'going shopping' (something she was still being maddeningly vague about), that he'd felt like he was talking to a different person. She'd been acting like the Asuka of his happier memories, the girl who took on Angels like it was a party, a chance to show off how great she was to everyone around, especially a certain Third Child. A girl who'd never been mind-raped into catatonia by an Angel or torn to pieces by SEELE's Evas. A girl who acted like she didn't have all the shadows in her heart that Shinji now knew too, too well were there.

而明日香...今早她究竟怎么了？她在黎明的海滩上向他微笑，那笑容在他目睹她陷入迷茫与失落时撕裂了他的心。就在她转身离去的那一刻，他差点伸出手去触碰她。然而，在找回母亲并“购物”（她对此仍然含糊其辞，令人抓狂）之后，她变得如此明亮、炽热，仿佛回到了过去的她，以至于他觉得自己在和另一个人交谈。她表现得像他记忆中更快乐的那个明日香，那个把对抗使徒当作派对，抓住机会向周围的人，尤其是某个第三适格者，展示自己有多么出色的女孩。那个从未被使徒精神摧残至木僵状态，也未被 SEELE 的 EVA 撕成碎片的女孩。 一个女孩，她装作心中没有真嗣如今深知确实存在的那些阴影。

What had happened in that mecha? She'd honestly apologized for something. Had that ever happened before? And he'd responded by...asking too much. He regretted his failure to come to her aid more than anything else in his life. When she'd asked him to think of something to apologize for, naturally that had popped to the surface before any other candidate. But what made him regret it so much was that it had hurt her so much, been such a betrayal. That very nature made it the hardest possible thing for her to forgive him for. Shinji sighed. 'I shouldn't have done that. It was too much. Why couldn't I have picked something else?' But another thought in his head argued right back, 'What else, you idiot? 'I'm sorry I was a better Pilot than you and made you go into a depression-spiral when my synch score beat yours?' 'I'm sorry my father was a titanic asshole and wouldn't risk my mother's spirit to let me come help you while you were begging for my help while you were being mind-raped?' 'I'm sorry I jerked off over you while you were in a coma?' 'I'm sorry I couldn't stop Winthrop from turning you into his personal sex-toy?' Face it, Ikari. Asking her to forgive you getting her killed was probably the least bad option. You're lucky she hasn't actively tied to kill you instead of herself. You can't even kiss her right. You tried to kiss her in her sleep when she was crying for her mother. What is with you and unconscious chicks?'

在那台机甲里究竟发生了什么？她为某事诚恳地道歉了。以前是否也有过类似情况？而他却回应得过于苛求。他一生中最悔恨的，莫过于未能给予她更多援助。当她让他想一件需要道歉的事时，这件事自然而然地首先浮现。然而，令他深感懊悔的是，此举对她造成了极大伤害，无异于背叛。正是这种性质，使得她难以宽恕他。真嗣叹息道：“我本不该那么做，太过分了。为何我不能选择其他事情呢？”但内心另一个声音立刻反驳：“你这个傻瓜，还能有什么其他选择？” '抱歉，我作为飞行员比你更优秀，我的同步率超越你让你陷入抑郁的漩涡？抱歉，我父亲是个极端自私的人，不愿冒险让我母亲的精神受牵连，所以没来援助你，而你却在绝望中呼唤我？抱歉，你在昏迷期间我自慰了？抱歉，我未能阻止温思罗普将你变成他的私人玩物？面对现实吧，碇。请求她原谅你导致她死亡，这或许已是最轻微的过错。你真幸运，她没有选择积极地报复你，而是自我了断。你甚至不懂如何正确地吻她，在她梦中呼唤母亲时试图吻她。你对昏迷中的女孩有何执念？''

And then what had he sworn to? "You've got my back, no matter what?" "Y-yes. I swear. No matter what." Easier said than believed, maybe, given how many times he'd let her down before. How could he demonstrate that he meant every word? He'd seen and done impossible things today already. Maybe Daniel or Rayana would have some idea. The impossible seemed to be their speed.

他曾发誓要做什么？"无论怎样，我都会支持你？" "是的，我发誓，无论如何。" 说起来容易，但要让人信服可能就难了，毕竟他之前让她失望过多次。他该如何证明自己的每一句话都是真心的呢？今天他已见证并完成了许多看似不可能的事。或许丹尼尔或拉亚娜能给出些建议，毕竟处理不可能之事似乎是他们的专长。

And just to make his morning even more surreal, there had been a cheering crowd when they pulled into the bay they'd launched from. Hundreds of people in black uniforms with a crimson ship's badge on their shoulders, loudly greeting their ship's namesake. Asuka had soaked it up like a plant given its first touch of water in years. Or at least she had been, until something made her stiffen, wave a quick farewell to the crowd, and call on her wristband for a sudden transport back to the surface. Asuka had muttered something about checking on her mother, and walked away. They hadn't even changed back into their clothes. He'd had to ask the house system to get their stuff sent down to them and his flight suit and helmet sent back.

为了让他的清晨更加超现实，当他们驶回出发的港湾时，竟有一群欢呼的人群迎接。数百人身着黑色制服，肩上别着鲜红的船徽，热情地向这艘船的同名人致意。明日香仿佛久旱逢甘霖的植物，尽情享受着这份热情。然而，某事突然让她身体一僵，她匆忙向人群挥手告别，并利用腕带紧急传送回地面。明日香低语着要去查看母亲的情况，随即离去。他们甚至未来得及换回常服。他只好请求房屋系统将他们的物品送至地面，并收回他的飞行服和头盔。

She'd reappeared for a moment a short time later to ask him to play her more Bach to help her fall asleep again, and for her mother in the back room. He'd obliged, and for the last hour had been steadily playing through several pieces by various composers as he tried to order his thoughts. He looked in at her mother just before he began, getting a quiet greeting from the priestess who'd left after they'd arrived. Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu looked like Asuka, minus the red hair. He'd left the doors open so the ladies could hear. The soundproofing in the house had proved too effective at quieting all sound when he'd closed the door.

不久后，她短暂地再次出现，请他再弹些巴赫的曲子，助她再次入眠，也为里屋的母亲。他应允了，过去一小时里，他持续弹奏着多位作曲家的作品，同时整理思绪。开始前，他探望了里屋的她母亲，得到了那位在他们抵达后离去的女祭司的轻声问候。Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu 与明日香相像，只是少了那一头红发。他特意让门敞开，以便女士们能听见。他发现房子的隔音效果过于出色，一旦关门，所有声音便被隔绝。

Reaching the end of the piece, he sighed and put the bow down. His head was still buzzing. Asuka's comment about a nap sounded good. He rested the cello against its stand, and walked to the bedroom. Asuka was...oh dear.

乐章终了，他轻叹一声，将弓放下。脑海中的嗡鸣依旧。飞鸟提议的小憩显得格外诱人。他将大提琴倚在架旁，缓步走向卧室。只见飞鸟...哎呀。

Her helmet and red pilot's suit were piled on the floor next to the bed, and the silky sheets made it abundantly clear she'd just dropped the suit and gotten into bed. The way the sheets clung to every curve of her made it very, very clear, oh yes. Shinji let his eyes play over her for a moment and again desperately wished their one attempt at sex hadn't been such a pathetic disaster. The most beautiful girl he'd ever talked to or even seen, who'd stolen his heart the minute he'd seen her on the deck of the Over The Rainbow, and she only either snarled or cried when he so much as touched her.

她的头盔和红色飞行服凌乱地堆在床边，丝滑的床单昭示着她刚褪下制服便匆匆入眠。床单紧贴着她的身形，勾勒出每一处曲线，清晰无比。真嗣的目光在她身上停留片刻，心中再次涌起对那次失败的性爱尝试的遗憾。她是他所遇见过最美丽的女孩，自从在彩虹号甲板上初见，便已俘获他的心。然而，每当他试图触碰，她要么怒吼，要么泪流。

Her tears were what had brought him to a halt now. She was crying in her sleep again, and starting to whimper. He liked playing his cello for her. It helped her fall sleep, and in the month since the coup he'd never seen her have a nightmare as long as he was playing. Once he stopped, however, her nightmares usually started, like now. He hated having to listen to her like that, mostly because he had never found the courage to do anything about it. Just like that long ago night in Misato's apartment, all he ever did was cover his ears and try not to listen.

她的泪水此刻让他止步。她又在睡梦中哭泣，开始呜咽。他喜欢为她拉大提琴，这能助她安然入睡。自政变以来，只要他在演奏，她便未曾有过噩梦。然而，一旦他停下，她的噩梦往往随之而来，正如现在。他厌恶听到她如此哭泣，主要是因为他从未鼓起勇气去改变现状。就像很久以前在三里户的公寓里那个夜晚，他所能做的只是捂住耳朵，尽量不去听。

He stripped down to his undershirt and boxers and slid into the other side of the bed. Asuka kept whimpering. Every sound made Shinji hurt. 'So why aren't you doing something about it, Ikari? Didn't you just say you'd do anything to take her pain away?' his brain yelled at him. He rolled over to face her, his heart stating to race as he contemplated what he was about to do. 'Why is this so scary? Because you'd be lucky if she only slapped you for this if she was awake, maybe? You swore, Ikari. You going to let her down again, not even two hours later? Do it!' Shinji took a deep breath and scooted closer. He raised one shaking hand to her shoulder and tugged to roll her over. His small tug got far more motion than he expected. Asuka rolled completely over, one of her legs flopping over his and her right arm ending up across his chest.

他脱到只剩背心和内裤，滑到床的另一侧。明日香依旧呜咽着，每一声都刺痛真嗣的心。'你为何还不动手，碇？你不是才说过愿意为她做任何事以减轻痛苦吗？'他的内心在质问。他转身面对她，心脏因即将的行动而狂跳。'为何这般恐惧？或许是因为，若她清醒，你可能会因此挨她一巴掌？你曾发誓，碇。难道你又要让她失望，连两小时都坚持不了？行动吧！'真嗣深吸一口气，靠近了些。他颤抖着伸出手，轻触她的肩膀，试图让她翻身。他那轻轻的一拉，却出乎意料地让她翻了过来。 明日香整个身子翻了过去，一条腿不经意间搭在了他的腿上，右臂顺势横放在他的胸口。

Shinji froze solid. Asuka was now wrapped completely around him. He hesitantly tried to slide backwards a little. She made an unhappy noise and pulled him tighter. No escape there. Her face was inches from his. He could see the hints of tears in her eyes...but she'd stopped whimpering. Instead she now gave a quiet sigh and burrowed her head into his shoulder.

真嗣僵住了。明日香紧紧地缠绕在他身上。他犹豫着试图向后挪动，她却不满地哼了一声，把他抱得更紧。显然，他无处可逃。她的脸近在咫尺，他看到她眼角的泪光，但她已不再啜泣，而是轻叹一声，将头埋进他的肩窝。

'Well, it worked. Now I'm just a dead man when she wakes up.' The adrenaline pounding through him kept him awake and staring with a little contentment at her peaceful face for a long time, but eventually even that faded and sleep took him. Asuka had never let go.

'嗯，成功了。现在她醒来时，我不过是个已死之人。' 他体内的肾上腺素让他保持清醒，长时间带着一丝满足凝视着她安详的面容，但最终这种感觉也消退了，睡意袭来。明日香始终没有放手。

Part 18 第十八部分

Going To Confession 前往忏悔

Asuka slowly roused to a drowsy half-waking. She felt... warm. Usually she woke up covered in cold sweat more than once a night from her chronic nightmares. On the rare occasions Winthrop or Jinnai had required her to remain after...finishing, she had only felt clammy and filthy lying next to them. But now she just felt gently and comfortably warm. She hadn't even had the usual slate of bad dreams, just pure rest, calm and soothing. She felt better on this waking than she had in...in years, really. Her mind half-heartedly tried to hold on to sleep, not wanting to give up on such a nice repose. But she was inexorably waking, finally becoming aware that she had moved in her sleep.

明日香渐渐从半梦半醒中苏醒，感到一种久违的温暖。往常，她常因噩梦连连而在冷汗中惊醒。即便偶尔温斯洛或阵内让她留宿，她也只觉得浑身不自在。然而此刻，她只感到一种温柔而舒适的暖意。这一夜，她未被噩梦侵扰，享受了纯粹的安宁与抚慰。醒来时，她感到前所未有的舒畅，仿佛多年未有。她的意识虽不舍这般美梦，却也渐渐清醒，意识到自己在睡梦中曾挪动过。

And that she was completely naked and now wrapped around the Third Child.

她一丝不挂，此刻正紧紧缠绕在第三个孩子身上。

She froze. The feeling of fabric against her hands reassured her that he at least was still wearing some clothes. Her gaze crawled up to his face. His eyes were closed. His heartbeat and breathing that she could clearly hear under her head were steady. He was still asleep. She started to very carefully pull away, only to stop short as his right arm turned out to be wrapped around her back, holding her in place.

她愣住了。手触碰到布料的感觉让她稍感安心，至少他身上还穿着衣物。她的视线慢慢上移，看到他闭着眼睛。她枕在他胸前，能清楚地听到他平稳的心跳和呼吸，他还在熟睡中。她小心翼翼地试图挪开，却突然停下，因为他的右臂正环绕在她背后，将她紧紧抱住。

She was stuck. 'Fuck.' 她陷入了困境。'真糟糕。'

A snide little voice in her head asked if that was perhaps the last word she should be thinking right now. She told it to shut up. Another traitorous voice inquired petulantly 'What's the problem? He's asleep and you feel great.' She told that voice to shut up too. Defiantly, that voice retorted 'Shinji smells good, he's nice and warm, and if you have a problem with all that, you can go fuck yourself.' Lacking a counterargument to that, she flushed slightly when she realized that some parts of her were quite happy with how she was situated. They hadn't showered after their flight. He did smell good. Um. 'Okay, Sohryu, you are not thinking about that.' 'Why not? Holding Mama's hand doesn't make me feel like this.' 'Because... because... I can't, damn it!'

她脑海中一个尖酸的声音质疑，这或许不是她此刻最该思考的问题。她让那声音闭嘴。另一个叛逆的声音不耐烦地插话：“有什么问题？他正熟睡，你感觉很好。”她也让这声音闭嘴。那声音反驳道：“真嗣身上味道很好，他温暖又舒适，如果你对此不满，那你自己解决吧。”她发现自己无法反驳，意识到自己某些部分对现状颇为满意，脸上不由得泛起红晕。他们下飞机后还未沐浴。他确实闻起来很舒服。呃。“好吧，明日香，别想那些。”“为什么不能想？握着妈妈的手并不会让我有这种感觉。”“因为...因为...我就是做不到，该死！”

A convulsive twist and roll brought her off the Third's body and stood her up next to the bed. Asuka held herself stock still, holding her breath and hoping he would stay asleep. He just rolled towards the warm spot her body had vacated and fumblingly felt around for what he'd lost. She kept holding her breath, leaving the room quiet enough for her to hear it quite clearly when he mumbled "Asuka..."

她一阵痉挛般的扭动和翻滚，从第三者的身体上挣脱下来，站到了床边。明日香僵直地站着，屏住呼吸，祈祷他能继续沉睡。他只是向她留下的温暖空位翻去，笨拙地摸索着失去的温暖。她继续屏息静气，房间静谧得让她清晰地听见他低声呢喃“明日香……”

Now her breath caught in her throat even harder. With a sudden gasp, she broke free of her paralysis and fled to the bathroom. "Asuka, you fucking coward," she whispered to herself as she started the water. No one could see you cry in a shower, so it didn't count, right?

此刻，她的呼吸愈发艰难地卡在喉咙。猛然间，她深吸一口气，挣脱了僵硬，奔向浴室。“明日香，你这个懦夫，”她低声自语，同时打开了水龙头。在淋浴中流泪无人知晓，所以这不算哭泣，对吧？

He was still asleep when Asuka darted back into the room long enough to throw on fresh clothes out of the dresser and closet by her side of the bed, then leave quickly. She wasn't fleeing, damn it. She just... wanted to see Mama. Right. She found Mother Sriyana sitting silently by the bed, head bent over the same book in her lap.

当他仍在沉睡之际，明日香疾步返回房间，迅速从床侧的衣柜和衣橱中取出干净衣物换上，随即匆匆离去。她并非逃避，绝非如此。她只是……渴望见到母亲。没错。她看到母亲斯里亚娜静坐床畔，低头凝视着膝上那本翻开的书。

She looked up from her reading as Asuka entered the room. "Hello, daughter. Your mother rests well." She tilted her head to one side, her grey-pupiled eyes examining Asuka's face. "Is there something wrong, child? You look...upset."

她从书本中抬起头，见明日香走进房间，便说：“你好，女儿。你妈妈睡得很安稳。”她侧着头，灰眸仔细打量着明日香的面庞，问道：“孩子，怎么了？你看起来...有些不高兴。”

"I... I'm fine, Mother Sriyana. I just woke up."

我...我没事，斯里亚娜母亲。我刚醒。

"You are 'fine', mm?" The priestess regarded her kindly for a moment. "There is no one awake for more than a mile around but you and I, child. You can speak without fear if you like. Anything you say will be bound by seal of confession."

你'还好'吧，嗯？"女祭司温和地注视着她。"方圆一英里内，除了你我，别无他人醒着。孩子，你若愿意，尽可畅所欲言，无需顾虑。你所言之事，将受忏悔之印的守护。

Asuka's mouth twisted sourly. "What good is that if everybody on this planet already knows everything about my 'story'? What could I tell you that you don't already know?"

明日香嘴角扭曲，带着一丝苦涩。“如果这星球上的人都已经对我的‘故事’了如指掌，那我还能告诉你们什么新鲜事呢？”

Mother Sriyana shook her head. "I do not know much about you, my child."

斯里亚娜母亲摇摇头说：“孩子，我对你了解不多。”

Asuka blinked. "What?" 明日香眨了眨眼，问道："什么？"

"When His Highness, Crown Prince Sean, summoned me, he advised me that you seemed uncomfortable with everyone you met knowing so many things about you that you'd prefer were not so public. So I did not delve into your story. I merely accepted knowledge from the Lord about your mother's name and condition, and left it at that. I do not know more about you than you have told me or that I have seen with my own senses. So you may tell me what you like, or not tell me. But I do not know any secrets about you that you wish were still hidden."

尊贵的王储肖恩殿下召见我时，提到您对每个人都了解您不愿公开的私事感到不适。因此，我并未深究您的过往。仅从领主处得知您母亲的名字和健康状况，便未再追问。我对您的了解，仅限于您所述或我亲眼所见。您可以选择分享或保留，我并不知晓您希望继续隐藏的秘密。

Asuka felt somewhat mollified by this, but still hesitated. "I'm not a very 'sharing' kind of person."

阿苏卡因此感到些许宽慰，但依旧犹豫。"我其实不太喜欢与人分享。"

"So I can see, child. But you also have the look of someone who very much wants to talk to someone to make sense of what is going on in their heart. That, or scream."

孩子，我能看见。不过，你似乎也很想找人倾诉，以便梳理内心的纷扰。或者，你只是想大声呐喊。

"That's starting to sound attractive, yeah," Asuka said, half to herself. She walked to the bedside and sat on the edge. She took one of her mother's hands and held it like a lifeline. She took a deep breath and held it. "Fine. You want to know what's on my mind, what has me upset?"

那开始听起来挺吸引人的，是吧，" 明日香喃喃自语。她走到床边，坐在床沿，紧紧握住母亲的手，如同抓住了救命稻草。她深吸一口气，屏住呼吸。"好吧。你想知道我心里在想什么，是什么让我心烦意乱吗？

"Only as much as you want to tell me, child."

孩子，你想告诉我多少就说多少。

"Hell, everyone else knows, why not you too? I'm a fucking mess! Two days ago I was a washed-up former child soldier, months from being made obsolete and losing the only life I'd even known, a life that I now hated as much as I'd once loved, but was still the only pleasure left to me! I was a worthless slut who's own mother didn't want her, who whored herself out to the biggest brute in the world to save her own neck! I was so repulsive that everyone in my life that I'd ever cared about had either died or betrayed me or both! I had a boy sleeping next to me I don't love, who doesn't want me, who's failed me in every way possible, and he was the best thing in my life! And I just fucking ran away from the only time anyone's held me in years because I was scared of how good it felt!" Only the presence of her sleeping mother kept Asuka from raising her voice into a shout.

地狱，其他人都知道，为何你却不知？我简直一团糟！两天前，我还是个被淘汰的前儿童兵，几个月后就要变得过时，失去我唯一熟悉的生活，一个我既憎恨又曾深爱的生活，但仍是仅存的乐趣！我是个连母亲都嫌弃的废物，为了保命而出卖自己给世上最野蛮的人！我如此令人厌恶，以至于我生命中所有我曾关心的人要么死去，要么背叛我，或者两者兼有！我身边躺着一个我不爱的男孩，他也不想要我，他在各方面都让我失望，而他竟是我生活中最好的存在！而我只是因为害怕那种美好的感觉而逃离了多年来唯一一次有人拥抱我的时刻！正是她熟睡的母亲的存在，才让明日香没有提高声音变成喊叫。

"And then...a guy who's supposed to be a fucking god walks into my room, turns my whole life upside-down, makes all that not true anymore...all of a sudden I'm a virgin, pure as the snow again, my mother is alive, my future as a Pilot is secure, he promises he'll resurrect or save all my friends, the boy swears he won't ever abandon me again on pain of his life, there's a fucking ship the size of a moon named after me with thousands of people aboard cheering my name... and I still ran away because I'm scared. I don't even know who I am anymore." Asuka faded to a stop. Her grip on her mother's hand was clenched so tight it was shaking. She made herself relax.

"接着...一个自诩为神的家伙闯入我的房间，彻底颠覆了我的世界，让一切化为泡影...转眼间我又恢复了处女之身，纯洁无瑕，母亲尚在人世，成为飞行员的未来稳如泰山，他承诺将复活或拯救我所有的朋友，那男孩誓言绝不再因生命之痛而离我而去，还有一艘以我命名的巨舰，其庞大如月，上面成千上万的人为我欢呼...然而我依旧因恐惧而逃离。我甚至迷失了自我。" 明日香的话语渐渐停歇。她紧握母亲的手因用力过猛而颤抖，她努力让自己放松下来。

Mother Sriyana took in her outburst with placid calm. "Well, child, when you confess, you do not do it by halves, do you?" she said. "So you were unhappy with what your life had become, but now feel adrift because all those unpleasant things were at least certainties?"

母亲斯里亚娜以平和的冷静面对她的爆发。“孩子，你坦白时总是这么彻底，不是吗？”她说。“你曾对生活的现状感到不满，而现在却因失去了那些不愉快的确切感而感到迷茫？”

"Yes." Asuka's look never left her mother's face.

"是的。" 明日香一直凝视着母亲的面部。

"All those certainties now replaced with things you would think would make you happier, but you feel too unsettled to accept them?"

那些曾经的确定性已被你认为能带来更多快乐的事物所替代，然而内心的不安让你难以接纳这些变化，是吗？

"Yes." Hardly more than a whisper now.

"是的。"此刻声音微弱得几乎听不见。

"Are you afraid?" 你感到害怕吗？

"'There is no such thing as fear'," Asuka grimly quoted. "Maybe if I say that constantly the way the Third Child used to chant 'I mustn't run away', I'll start to believe it."

‘不存在恐惧这回事’，明日香冷冷地引用道。‘或许我若像第三适格者过去常念叨‘我不能逃避’那样，反复说这句话，我也会开始相信它。’

"Ah, been hanging out with some of our service members, hm? That squid 'aviator' I saw earlier?"

哦，和我们的服务人员一起出去玩了，是吧？之前我看到的那个'飞行员'章鱼？

"What?" 什么？

The priestess gave her a look whose intensity was weirdly at odds with her prior calm. "Beat Navy."

女祭司凝视着她，眼神异常强烈，与先前的平和形成鲜明对比，"要战胜海军。"

Now Asuka was just confused. "What?"

此刻，明日香一头雾水。“什么啊？”

"I was in the Imperial Army," the Mother said with quiet pride.

母亲带着平静的自豪说：'我曾是帝国军队的一员。'

"I thought priestesses were supposed to be non-violent?"

我以为女祭司本应避免使用暴力呢？

"Do not be silly. She is not the 'Lady of Mothers' Gentle Chiding'. We are a martial order as well as a healing one. I served my five hundred as a chaplain, healer, and battle priestess with the Imperial Army. In any case, levity about our traditional inter-service rivalry is hardly what you need right now, child. You sound like you are about to fly apart at the seams from internal pressures and badly want something to hold on to."

别傻了。她可不是什么‘慈母般温柔责备的女士’。我们既是战士也是医者。我在帝国军队里当了五百年的随军牧师、治疗师和战斗女祭司。说到底，现在你需要的不是拿我们内部传统竞争开玩笑，孩子。你内心的压力似乎要让你四分五裂，急需找到支撑。

Asuka nodded slowly. "Yeah, that's about right. Right now the only thing that makes me feel good is piloting the mecha the crew of 'my' ship gave me... or..."

明日香缓缓点头，说道：“嗯，差不多吧。现在唯一能让我感到欣慰的，就是驾驶‘我的’船员赠予的机甲……又或者是……”

"Or?" Sriyana asked after Asuka's pause grew long.

"怎么样？"见飞鸟沉默良久，斯瑞亚娜追问道。

'Or waking up right now being held by someone. Or listening to them play for me.' Asuka thought to herself, still lacking the will to say it aloud. It was hard enough to even think it. 'Someone not a power-hungry dictator or his even more ruthless subordinate.' '"Someone", or him?' asked that traitorous voice again.

'或者此刻醒来，正被某人拥入怀中。或者聆听他们为我弹奏。'飞鸟心中默想，依旧没有勇气说出口。光是想到这些就已足够艰难。'不是贪恋权力的暴君，亦非其更为冷酷的副手。'“某人”，抑或“他”？那叛逆的声音再次在耳边响起。

"Or I don't know. Holding Mama's hand helps. No matter what else happens, this makes it all worth it."

或许我也不太明白。但握着妈妈的手确实能带来安慰。不管其他事情如何，这份温暖让一切都显得值得。

"Or something you are still too frightened of to say out loud?" the priestess asked gently. "I can hear things you are not saying, child."

还是有什么你至今仍因恐惧而未敢明言的？"女祭司温柔地询问，"孩子，我能感知到你心中的未言之语。

Asuka was well aware her silence spoke volumes. She kept her eyes on her mother's face. It was like looking into a mirror of her future. She could see a lot of her own face there.

明日香清楚，她的沉默胜过千言。她专注地望着母亲的脸，如同在镜中预见自己的未来，那张脸上有着太多她自己的影子。

"What of the boy?" 那孩子怎么样了？

Asuka's mind refused to even grapple with the question. The whole array of thoughts orbiting the idea of the Third Child skittered around in her brain like a marble on ice. "I don't know."

明日香的思绪完全回避了这个问题，关于第三适格者的种种念头在她脑海里如同冰上滚动的弹珠，四处跳跃。她只能回答：“我不清楚。”

"That is the center of it, is it not? Was he your familiar thing to lean on, and now even that is changing in ways that scare you? What is he to you?"

那不正是核心所在吗？他曾是你的依靠，如今连这份依靠也在变化，让你感到不安。他对你意味着什么？

"I don't know." 'The Third Child. A fellow Pilot. A wingman. A rival. The one who could have saved me but didn't. The one who tried to choke the life out of me,' she mentally listed.

我不清楚。'第三个孩子。一位飞行员伙伴。我的僚机。我的对手。本可以救我却袖手旁观的人。那个曾试图置我于死地的人，'她在心中默默数着。

'Someone who looks at you. The one who jumped into a volcano to save you. The one who offered himself to Winthrop in your place. The one who carried you and wouldn't let go when you were wounded during the coup. The one who's help let you be a Pilot again. The one who had the idea about the S2 engine that saved both of your lives in that fight,' the voice argued back.

'凝视你的人。那个为了救你，奋不顾身跳入火山的人。那个在你面前挺身而出，代替你面对温斯洛的人。那个在你政变受伤时，紧紧抱住你不放的人。那个助你重拾飞行员身份的人。那个在激战中提出 S2 引擎方案，挽救你俩生命的人。'

Asuka wasn't about to leave that alone. 'The one who betrayed me, who let me die! He could have saved me!'

明日香绝不会善罢甘休。'那个背叛我，眼睁睁看我死去的人！他本可以救我的！'

'The one who apologized and swore never to desert you again. Has anyone else ever done that?' the voice asked with acid clarity. 'The one you were happy when you woke up next to, who took away your nightmares.'

'那个向你道歉并发誓永不离开的人，还有谁曾这样做过？' 声音尖锐而清晰地问道。'那个让你醒来时感到幸福的人，他驱散了你的噩梦。'

Asuka's thoughts skittishly shied away from examining that last too closely. 'He apologized, but can't I forgive him just like that. We've hurt each other too much, too often.'

明日香的思绪羞涩地避开了深入那最后一点的念头。'他虽然道了歉，但我难道就能如此轻易地原谅他吗？我们彼此伤害得太深，太频繁了。'

"Is he the one who held you?"

他是抱过你的那个人吗？

Panic. "What?! I didn't...He...I...how did you...what?!"

惊慌道："什么？！我...他...我...你怎么知道的...什么?!"

"You just told me, child. You 'just ran away from the only time anyone has held you in years because you were scared of how good it felt'? Was he the one?"

你刚不是说了吗，孩子。你是因为害怕那种久违的温暖感觉太好，才逃离了多年来唯一一次有人拥抱你的时刻吗？是他吗？

"I... I..." 'Yes. He smelled nice and was warm.' 'Shut UP, you!' "I... yes. The Third Child and I have an arrangement. We both are the last survivors of… our unit. No one else in the world can understand what we went through. So after the last battle, when he asked... I told him that I didn't love him... but that he won by default. That he could have me. I didn't expect him to say yes. We just both don't want to be alone. So we're… together." Asuka was morbidly proud of how even she kept her voice.

"我...我..." "是的。他身上有股好闻的味道，也很温暖。" "闭嘴，你！" "我...是的。第三适格者和我，我们都是各自部队的最后幸存者。这世上再无人能理解我们的遭遇。所以在最后一战后，当他提出...我告诉他我不爱他...但他赢了，默认地赢了。他可以拥有我。我没想到他会接受。我们只是都不愿孤单。所以我们...在一起。" 明日香对自己能如此平静地保持声音感到一种病态的自豪。

"You did not expect him to say yes? Does that not make you offering him such just an attempt to push him away? If you do not love him, you sound awfully upset with yourself for running away from a good thing due to being scared," Sriyana said, sounding curious.

"你没料到他会同意吧？这岂不是意味着你提出这样的建议，只是为了将他拒之门外？如果你并不爱他，你对自己因恐惧而错失良机感到异常自责，"斯里亚娜好奇地说道。

"I don't. I told him I didn't," Asuka said flatly.

"我没有。我明确告诉他我不愿意," 明日香冷冷地说。

"Now you sound like you are trying to repeat something until you start to believe it." Sriyana moved the closed book off of her lap to the bedside table. "I did not get to be a Donna by being bad at hearing what people are not saying, child. You are scared of him being the cause of good feelings in you? Hmm. You say you do not love him, but I think you are frightened that you might. Love can be quite frightening, particularly if it is your first, even more so if it might be your undounamata, your One True. That can make cowards of even the bravest. The Lord Himself, who has never shied from battle and death, was frozen by fear when He first saw the Lady."

现在你听起来像是在不断重复某些话，直到自己都信以为真。" 斯里亚娜将合上的书从膝上挪到床头柜。"我之所以能成为多娜，是因为我擅长听出人们未言明的意思，孩子。你害怕他成为你心中美好情感的源头吗？嗯。你声称不爱他，但我看你是害怕自己可能会爱上他。爱情确实令人畏惧，尤其是初次经历，更不用说，如果他可能是你的命中注定。这足以让最勇敢的人也心生怯意。主自己，虽从未在战斗和死亡面前退缩，但当他第一次见到女士时，也被恐惧所困。

Sriyana chuckled. "Though who would not be? The Lady can be quite terrifying as the Destroyer. But He was frozen by Her beauty, and the way She made the whole world around Her shine. If He had not found the courage to speak to Her, Avalon would lack half of what makes it whole, the day without the night. Do not let fear stop you, child."

斯里亚娜轻声笑道：“谁又能不为之动容呢？作为毁灭者的女神确实令人敬畏。然而，他被她的美貌所震撼，她让周围的世界都变得光彩夺目。如果他没有勇气与她对话，阿瓦隆就会失去构成其完整性的一半，如同白昼缺失了黑夜。孩子，别让恐惧成为你的绊脚石。”

"I'm... not ..." 'Yes, you are, you fucking coward. You didn't get out of that bed because you were hungry or you wanted a shower; you got out so you wouldn't get caught!' The voice was getting angrier and harder to suppress. 'You're just scared if he gets close he'll find out how ugly you are inside! Why the Hell would he even want someone like you? You're a whore! An ugly, black-hearted bitch that doesn't care about so-called 'subversives' being publicly tortured to death, like he still does! You called him weak and selfish for begging you to help him during Instrumentality. You need him even worse than that! Without him you couldn't even Pilot anymore! You'd be useless, all over again! Useless! No one wants to look at a useless, ugly little girl! NO ONE!'

"我...不是...”“没错，你就是，你这该死的懦夫。你起床并非因为饥饿或想洗澡；你起来是怕被逮个正着！”那声音愈发愤怒，难以抑制。“你只是害怕他一旦靠近，就会看穿你内心的丑陋！他凭什么要你这样的人？你是个荡妇！一个丑陋、心黑的贱人，对那些所谓的‘异见者’被公开折磨至死视若无睹，就像他依旧做的那样！你在统一体期间因为他求你帮忙而骂他软弱自私。你比那更需要他！没有他，你连驾驶都不能了！你会再次一无是处！一无是处！没人愿意看一个无用、丑陋的小女孩！没人！”

"What is his name?" Sriyana asked.

"他叫什么名字？"斯里亚娜问道。

Asuka almost sobbed in relief as the question snapped her out of another depressive spiral. They'd been coming more often after the coup, far more often once they'd heard that the new Dummy Plug project was nearing completion. She'd managed to keep the Third from ever seeing one, usually confining them until she was alone in a shower. This one had come on faster, and she'd nearly broken down in front of a virtual stranger. She blinked fast to clear the incipient tears from her eyes. "Uh...his name is..." 'God damn it, Sohryu, just spit it out! It's just a name!' 'No, it's just his name.' "...Shinji."

当问题将她从又一次的抑郁漩涡中拉出来时，明日香几乎要哭出声来。政变之后，这些情绪来得更加频繁，尤其是当他们听说新的 Dummy Plug 项目即将完成时。她设法让第三个人从未见过这些，通常将他们限制在她独自洗澡的时候。这一次来得更快，她差点在一个完全陌生的人面前崩溃。她快速眨眼，试图清除眼中的泪水。“呃……他的名字是……”‘该死的，惣流，快说出来！只是一个名字而已！’‘不，只是他的名字。’“……真嗣。”

"Have you known him long?"

你和他认识很久了吗？

"About five years, but we were...kept apart for most of the last three." Asuka forced her voice even. "We fought in a war together, and lived together during it. That lasted a little under two years."

大约五年了，但过去三年里我们大多时候被迫分开。" 明日香努力让声音保持平稳。"我们曾一同参战，并在战时共同生活，那段时光持续了不到两年。

"Why do you call him 'Third Child' instead of his name?"

为什么你称呼他为'老三'，而不直接叫他的名字呢？

"I... I always do. He's used to it." Asuka could hardly even explain why to herself anymore, let alone to this woman.

"我...我总是这样。他已经习以为常了。" 明日香自己都难以向自己解释清楚，更不用说向这位女士说明了。

"That does not answer my question," Sriyana noted with a fractionally raised eyebrow.

"那并未解答我的疑问，"斯里亚娜微挑眉毛表示。

'Damn all people who pay attention and use logic.' "I...don't know." 'Because his name makes you feel things, bitch.'

'真烦那些关注细节又讲逻辑的人。"我...真不清楚。"就因为他的名字让你心有所感，贱人。'

Sriyana looked towards the bedroom. "Perhaps I should speak to him once he wakes."

斯里亚娜朝卧室看去，心想：“他醒来后，我或许该跟他谈谈。”

Asuka firmly suppressed the wave of panic that shot through her at that. That firm suppression was a lot less firm than it should have been, thanks to her mental fingers already being fully involved in other cracks in the dam. "You aren't going to mention any of this, are you?"

阿苏卡竭力压制住那一刻袭来的恐慌。然而，由于她的心智已全力应对堤坝的其他裂缝，这种压制远不如应有的坚定。“你不会提及这些的，对吧？”

"You have nothing to worry about on that front, child. The seal of confession is breakable only by the Lord and Lady Themselves, and the Prince informed me They have promised to you that They will conduct Themselves with only the most scrupulous honesty with you and your friend Shinji. Prying into our discussion here would not be in keeping with that." Sriyana said reassuringly. "Give me your hand, child."

孩子，你在这方面大可放心。告解的封印唯有主神和女神能解，王子已向我确认，他们向你承诺，在与你及你的朋友真嗣相处时，将恪守最严格的诚信。探听我们之间的对话并不符合这一承诺。" 斯里亚娜温和地安慰道，"孩子，把手伸给我。

Asuka reached out her right hand and Sriyana took it, then used her own right to grasp Kyoko's left. The three of them now made a triangle. Asuka felt her panic and turmoil subside as a peaceful, calm feeling spread throughout her from her hands.

明日香伸出右手，斯里亚娜随即握住，并用她的右手牵起了京子的左手，三人由此形成了一个三角。随着手与手的相触，明日香内心的慌乱与纷扰渐渐平息，一股宁静安详的感觉自掌心蔓延至全身。

The priestess closed her eyes and spoke softly and with certainty. "I am here. You are here. Your mother is here. The Lady is here. We are not alone. No matter what burdens we must bear, we never have to bear them alone. The Lady Mother is always there for her children, and all of Avalon. Be at peace, child. Mother is always with you."

女祭司闭上双眼，声音柔和而坚定：“我在此，你在此，你的母亲亦在此，女神亦在此。我们并非孤立无援。无论肩负何等重担，我们都不必孤身承受。女神母亲永远守护着她的子民，守护着整个阿瓦隆。孩子，安心吧，母亲永远与你同在。”

Asuka gratefully used the calm feeling to reestablish some emotional equilibrium. Her pulse finally crept back down from the pounding beat it had risen to under her own self-inflicted emotional lashing.

明日香感激地借助这份宁静，重新找回了情绪的平衡。她的心跳终于从因自我情绪折磨而加速的剧烈状态中慢慢平复下来。

Mother Sriyana gently let go of her hand. "That should help you a little, my child. I could sense your distress. You can always call on the Lady Mother for strength when you have need. She will be there. Now, you have told me some of your troubles. Would you like my counsel, or is the sharing of your pain enough for now?"

母亲斯里亚娜温柔地松开了她的手，说道：“这或许能稍稍缓解你的痛苦，我的孩子。我能感受到你的困扰。当你需要力量时，随时可以向圣母求助，她会与你同在。你已经向我倾诉了一些烦恼，是否还需要我的建议，或者仅仅是倾诉就已经足够？”

Asuka considered it. She had always held all of this inside. She did not trust anyone to be close enough to understand her to have any meaningful discussion about any of it. But she knew all too well that she was reaching the limit of her strength to maintain that hold. She could feel herself starting to lose her grip on herself. If something didn't change soon she'd be back in the same passively suicidal abyss she'd been in right before they shoved her back into Unit-02 for the last time. Two days ago, she'd been keeping herself together with the prospect of one more chance at glory in battle, taking her patchwork MP Eva into the fight for South America, one more opportunity to show the world how good she was...before the Dummy Plugs would come online, and she and Shinji would be superfluous, useless. She'd be an Eva Pilot with no more Eva, and all too aware she had no other value in the world.

明日香沉思着。她始终将这些心事深埋。她不信任任何人，不愿让人接近到能理解她的程度，去展开任何有意义的对话。但她清楚，自己维持这种控制的力气已近极限。她感到自己开始失去对自己的掌控。若不尽快改变现状，她将重陷之前那种被动的自杀性深渊，就在他们最后一次将她送入二号机之前。两天前，她还靠着在南美战场上再争荣耀的希望支撑自己，驾驶着拼凑的 MP 版 EVA，再次向世界证明她的实力……在 Dummy Plugs 投入使用前，她和真嗣将沦为无用之人。她将是一个没有 Eva 可驾驶的 Eva 驾驶员，深感自己在这个世界上已无其他价值。

'If this goes on-' "I would... appreciate your advice," she finally managed. Mama was here, she'd make everything better. She just had to last the week. Just hold on.

'如果这种情况继续下去——"我...真的很希望能得到您的建议,"她终于鼓起勇气说道。要是妈妈在这里,她定能让一切好转。她只需熬过这个星期。坚持住。'

"You have a very low opinion of yourself. You called yourself a whore, repulsive, a worthless slut, unwanted by your mother...and you ran from feeling good. You hate yourself for compromises you chose to make in the name of survival. You are afraid this boy will turn away from you because of this. I think this worries you more than the rest; you cannot even say his name without difficulty. He is important to you, and you fear he will desert you if he comes to view you as you do yourself. You do not love him, but it is still important to you that he be there. He is your familiar point to hold yourself around when all is changing," Sriyana laid out calmly. "Am I incorrect on any point so far?"

你对自己评价极低，自称为妓女、令人作呕、毫无价值的荡妇，甚至被母亲所拒。你逃避了任何美好的感受。你因为了生存而做出的妥协而憎恨自己。你害怕这个男孩会因此离你而去。这比其他任何事都更让你忧心；你甚至难以启齿他的名字。他对你至关重要，你担心如果他开始像你自己那样看待你，他会离你而去。你并不爱他，但他是否在场对你依然重要。他是你在一切都在变化时，围绕自己保持的熟悉支点，"Sriyana 平静地陈述道。"我刚才说的有哪里不对吗？

Asuka's stomach roiled. Hearing it all put in front of her at once nearly made her want to run for the bathroom and empty her stomach. The fact she'd have to run past the Third Child held her in place. "No."

明日香的胃一阵翻江倒海。突然间听到这么多信息，她几乎要冲进洗手间呕吐。然而，想到必须从第三适格者面前跑过，她才勉强站住。"不行。"

"Then I suggest you talk to him. I do not think he will call you as terrible as you call yourself. I would not. I see strength in you, child, but you are breaking yourself trying to be so strong that you do not need anyone. If he is your center, then trust in him. Tell him you need his support, and he will share your burden. You fear his refusal, but you are already suffering in the same solitude that refusal would bring you. You would not lose anything by asking but that bit of hope, and that hope is just as absent if you never reach for it. "There Is No Such Thing As Fear"? Perhaps. Do not fear the pain, child, but the paralysis it brings. Fear means nothing if you can keep moving anyway. Remember the motto of the Imperial Army, for it now guards you too; 'Numquam Soli. Semper, Sumus Legio', 'Never Alone. Always, We Are Legion'. You are not unworthy, child. The Lady would not have embraced you if so. I can feel her arms around you. You will never be rejected here, never so low that we will not hold you with us. Reach out to him, and we will be with you. You will be no worse off than you are now, and you may find more than you believe possible in him."

我建议你和他谈谈。我相信他不会像你自责的那样看待你。我在你身上看到了力量，但你在试图变得过于坚强而独立时，正在伤害自己。如果他是你的依靠，那就信任他。告诉他你需要他的支持，他会与你共同承担重担。你担心他的拒绝，但其实你已经在经历那种被拒绝后的孤独。开口请求并不会让你失去什么，除了那一线希望，而如果你不去争取，那希望也本就不存在。'没有恐惧这回事'？或许如此。不要害怕痛苦本身，而是要害怕它让你停滞不前。只要你能继续前行，恐惧便无足轻重。记住帝国军队的座右铭，它现在也守护着你：'永不孤单'。 “Semper, Sumus Legio”，意为“永不孤单，我们始终是军团”。孩子，你绝非不配，若非如此，女神不会拥抱你。我能感受到她双臂的温暖环绕着你。在这里，你永远不会被拒之门外，无论多么低落，我们都会与你同在。向他伸出援手吧，我们将与你同行。你不会比现在更糟，或许还能在他身上发现超乎想象的希望。"

The tension in Asuka uncoiled all at once, snapping out into whipcrack anger as it had so often before, keeping away anything that might break through her defenses. "You think it's that easy? If it was so simple, I would have done it already! Tell me something I don't know!" she snarled at the priestess. "Nobody good enough for me to want would want me if they knew what I was like inside!"

明日香的紧张情绪瞬间爆发，如同往常一样化作鞭打般的愤怒，阻挡着任何可能突破她防线的东西。“你以为这很简单？要是那么容易，我早就行动了！给我说点我不知道的！”她冲着女祭司怒吼。“那些我看得上的人，一旦了解我内心的真实，肯定不会愿意接近我！”

"How do you know if you never have?" Sriyana said soothingly. "You say he has been with you for years. He accepted you even when you thought he would turn you down. It felt good when he held you. Take the risk for more. Stasis only keeps you where you are now; hurting."

你从未尝试，又怎会知晓结果？" 斯里亚娜温柔地劝慰道。"你提到他与你相伴多年，即便在你担心被拒之时，他依然接纳了你。他拥抱你时的温暖，你还记得吧。为了更深的情感，不妨勇敢一试。停滞不前，只会让你困于当前的痛苦。

"We've hurt each other before, too many times, too many betrayals," Asuka said sadly, her anger fading into familiar fear. "We're not the people we were back then. There's too much to forgive now." She stared at her mother's hand. 'How can he forgive me, or I him, when I can't even forgive myself?'

"我们曾多次彼此伤害，背叛无数，" 明日香哀伤地说，怒气渐消，熟悉的恐惧涌上心头。"我们已非昔日之人。如今，需要原谅的太多。" 她凝视着母亲的手。'他如何能原谅我，我又怎能原谅他，若我连自己都无法宽恕？'

"To err is divine, to forgive is human," Sriyana stated with complete conviction.

"犯错乃神性，宽恕乃人性，"斯里亚娜坚定地宣称。

Asuka gave Mother Sriyana a puzzled look. "Isn't that supposed to go the other way?"

明日香疑惑地看向斯里亚娜母亲，问道：“那不应该是反过来的吗？”

"Not around here. The Lord Himself would be the first one to admit He has made mistakes. His own hubris led to the loosing of the Adversary on the cosmos. When He recovered from that error, and found the Lady again, She still forgave Him as long as he dedicated Himself to making it right. Gods judge. Man forgives. Why do you think the Lord devotes so much effort to remaining human?"

这里并非事发之地。主本人也会首先承认自己曾犯过错。正是他的傲慢导致了对手在宇宙中的肆虐。当他从那次错误中恢复，再次寻回女神时，只要他矢志改正，她依然宽恕了他。神明裁决，人类宽恕。你可曾想过，主为何如此执着于保持人性？

Again, Asuka had no ready answer. Mother Sriyana let the silence hang for a moment, then offered her one last piece of advice. "You run as long as you can. When you cannot run anymore, you crawl... and when you cannot do that, you find someone to carry you. You are not alone, daughter. Life is in the living of it. Seize yours."

又一次，明日香哑口无言。母亲斯里亚娜让沉默弥漫片刻，随后给出了最后的忠告：“竭尽所能地奔跑吧。当无力再跑时，就爬行……若连这都做不到，那就寻求他人的扶持。你并非孤身一人，女儿。生活的真谛在于活出自我。把握住你的生活。”

With that, the grey-eyed priestess stood up and walked around the bed to lay her hand lightly on Asuka's head. She whispered a blessing, and left Asuka with her mother.

于是，灰眸的女祭司起身，绕到床的另一侧，轻抚飞鸟的额头。她轻声念出祝福，之后便让飞鸟与母亲相聚。

### Chapter 11 Kung-Fu Flirting

Children You Never Had, Things That Didn't Happen

未曾拥有的孩子，未曾发生的事

Shinji blinked awake. He was slightly surprised about that.

真嗣眨了眨眼，醒了过来。对此他略感惊讶。

After finally falling asleep with Asuka clamped around him like he was a giant teddy bear, he'd expected to either be pounded awake by Teutonic fury, or not wake up all because she'd instantly murdered him when she opened her eyes. To just drowsily blink at yet another unfamiliar ceiling was frankly amazing. He'd even managed to relax enough before sleep claimed him to enjoy the almost unique treat of her warmth against him. Though they'd shared a bed for a month since the coup and the start of their 'arrangement', she always slept on the far side from him, almost never even within arm's reach, let alone touching. At least when she slept facing him he could look at her face. She was beautiful in rest, when the nightmares didn't seize her.

终于在明日香如巨型泰迪熊般紧紧环绕下入睡后，他本以为要么会被条顿式的怒火猛烈唤醒，要么就因为她在睁眼的瞬间将他即刻杀害而永远沉睡。然而，仅仅是慵懒地眨眼望向又一个陌生的天花板，这本身就堪称奇迹。甚至在睡意袭来前，他已足够放松，得以享受她紧贴身旁的温暖，这种近乎独一无二的体验。尽管政变以来，他们已同床共枕一个月，按照他们的“安排”，她总是睡在离他最远的那一侧，几乎从不曾近到伸手可及，更别提触碰了。至少当她面朝他入睡时，他还能凝视她的面容。她静谧时的美丽，若非噩梦侵扰，宛若画中人。

He rolled his head to the right, but found only an empty bed. He felt the spot where she'd been, but it was cool. She hadn't left recently. The bedroom door was closed. He wondered what time it was. He looked at his watch and puzzled over its report that it was past 4pm, but noontime bright outside. 'Oh, right, longer day here.' "BH, what time is it?"

他向右转头，却只见一张空床。他触摸她曾躺过的地方，但已是一片凉意。她并非刚离开。卧室门紧闭着。他纳闷现在是什么时间。他看向手表，对它显示的下午四点多感到困惑，而外面却是正午般的明亮。“哦，对了，这里白天更长。”“BH，现在几点了？”

"At the tone, the local time will be 1538," the system coolly replied, then beeped.

"提示音响起时，当地时间将是 1538 分，"系统冷静地回答后，发出了一声哔响。

Maybe it knew where she was..."Where's Asuka?"

或许它知道她在哪儿……“明日香在哪？”

"Asuka Langley Sohryu is in the second bedroom of this building with Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu."

明日香·兰格雷与京子·齐柏林·兰格雷在这栋建筑的第二个卧室里。

Sitting with her mother, probably. Shinji shrugged and got dressed in the same clothes he'd started the day in. If Asuka was going to pick his outfit for this mysterious 'dinner date', there was no point in bothering to spend time picking a new outfit now. He'd just stepped into the hallway when the house system chimed at him.

大概正和母亲坐在一起吧。真嗣耸了耸肩，穿上了与清晨相同的衣物。既然明日香要为这次神秘的“晚餐约会”挑选他的着装，现在花时间挑选新衣服就毫无意义了。他刚踏入走廊，家中的系统便向他发出了提示音。

"Ikari-san, you have an incoming comm call from Senior Fleet Commander of the White Ikari on the living room screen."

"碇先生，您有一通来自白碇舰队高级舰队指挥官的通讯呼叫，正在客厅屏幕上显示。"

Senior Fleet who? Was his father calling him? Did he even want to answer if it was?

高级舰队是谁？是他父亲在叫他吗？如果是的话，他甚至想不想回答？

"Is it my father?" he asked suspiciously.

"是我父亲吗？" 他怀疑地问道。

"Negative, Senior Fleet Commander Ikari is not your father, sir," the house replied without inflection.

"否定，高级舰队指挥官碇源堂并非您的父亲，先生，"房屋毫无感情地回答道。

"Fine. I'll answer it, I guess." He walked into the living room.

“好吧，我想我会回答的。”他走进了客厅。

The white and red shield with the elaborate wreathing that he'd seen on Daniel's armor was on the screen with 'INCOMING CALL' flashing underneath. "Um, BH, answer it?" Another chime, and the screen cleared.

他曾在丹尼尔的盔甲上见过的那面白红相间的盾牌，此刻正带着精美的花环装饰出现在屏幕上，下方闪烁着“来电呼叫”的字样。“呃，BH，接听吗？”又一声提示音后，屏幕上的画面消失了。

Asuka stared back at him from the bridge of a starship.

明日香从一艘星舰的舰桥上回望着他。

He blinked. Wait, no, it wasn't her. She had the same thick red mane and he could distinctly see Asuka's cheekbones in her, but the dark blue eyes, darker than Asuka's sapphire, the pointed chin, the jawline were his... There was no doubt to it; this 'Commander Ikari' was the daughter of Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu. A daughter who looked at least twice his age and was wearing the same space-black uniform as Lieutenant Leibshott. She certainly grinned at him like Asuka did, though.

他眨了眨眼。等等，不，不是她。她有着同样浓密的红发，他清晰地看到了她脸上的明日香颧骨，但那深蓝的眼睛，比明日香的蓝宝石还要深邃，尖尖的下巴，轮廓分明的下颌线，都是他的特征……毫无疑问，这位“碇司令”是碇真嗣和明日香·兰格雷的女儿。一个看起来至少比他大两倍的女儿，穿着与莱布施托特中尉相同的太空黑制服。她确实像明日香一样对他咧嘴笑了。

"Hi there!" she said jauntily.

"嗨，你好呀！" 她轻快地说道。

"... uh... um..." Shinji at least remembered to close his mouth after a few seconds.

"...呃...嗯..." 至少真嗣在几秒钟后还记得合上嘴巴。

"Yeah, mom always said you weren't the sharpest conversationalist when you were younger, dad."

是啊，妈妈以前总说你年轻时不是最会聊天的，爸爸。

Shinji's brain went on strike at this. His mouth joined in, refusing to get back to work until someone explained what the heck was going on.

渚薰的脑子此时罢工了。他的嘴巴也加入其中，拒绝复工，直到有人解释清楚这到底是怎么回事。

The woman in the thick command chair grinned at his stunned silence for a bit, then started to snicker. "Oh, Lord, I know I shouldn't have done that, but it was too funny! Ahem!" She cleared her throat and started over. "Good afternoon, Ikari-san. I am Senior Fleet Commander of the White Misato Sohryu-Ikari, Fifth Officer of the HMS Shinji Ikari. A school friend called me a few hours ago to tell me that you and a certain German-American redhead had dropped in to visit her ship and take one of their mecha for a spin. Given that we hadn't received a similar such courtesy call, and going by what my mother has said she and my father were like when they were kids, I concluded that you likely didn't know our ship also existed and was in-system. Therefore, I decided to call and welcome you to our fair Realm, and extend an offer of a visit to your own namesake ship."

坐在厚实指挥椅上的女子对他的震惊沉默笑了片刻，随后开始窃笑。“哦，天哪，我知道我不该那么做，但实在太有趣了！咳咳！”她清了清嗓子，重新开始。“下午好，碇君。我是白舰队高级指挥官，HMS 真嗣碇号第五指挥官，白美里惣流·碇。几小时前，一位学友告诉我，你和一个德裔美国红发女孩突然造访了她的船，并试驾了他们的机甲。鉴于我们没有收到类似的礼节性通知，再结合我母亲描述的他们年轻时的样子，我推测你可能不知道我们的船也存在于此星系。因此，我决定联系你，欢迎你来到我们美丽的领域，并邀请你访问以你命名的船只。”

"Gleeg." Nope, brain and mouth still not cooperating.

"咕噜。" 不，大脑和嘴巴还是没配合好。

"Wow, I think I broke you. To put your mind back in order, you're not my father. My dad is Shinji Ikari, he's just not you. You're a lot skinnier, for example. My mother is Asuka Langley Sohryu, but she's not the one I hear is with you down there. They're from a different worldline very similar to yours, but yours is a rather darker one, I understand. But if you're anything like my parents, I can make some pretty good guesses as to how you'd act. So, I called. Sorry, the temptation to play with your head is definitely something I inherited from mom." Her smile had the same sharp edge to it, too.

哇，我觉得我把你搞糊涂了。为了让你头脑清醒，你不是我父亲。我爸爸是碇真嗣，他只是不是你。比如说，你瘦多了。我妈妈是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，但她不是我听说和你在一起的那位。他们来自一个与你的世界线非常相似但更黑暗的平行世界。但如果你和我父母有任何相似之处，我大概能猜到你会怎么反应。所以，我打了这个电话。抱歉，捉弄你的冲动绝对是遗传自妈妈的。她的笑容也带着同样的锋芒。

'Oh thank the GODS...' Shinji's brain breathed a sigh of relief and called off the strike. "Um... hello... er, Commander Ikari." This was still way too strange. 'Commander Ikari' was not something he was supposed to be calling a beautiful redhead who kept smiling at hi-Focus, Ikari! "Um...i-it is good to meet you."

'哦，感谢神明……' 真嗣的脑海中松了一口气，取消了罢工。"呃……你好……那个，碇司令。" 这还是太奇怪了。'碇司令' 不是他应该用来称呼一位一直对他微笑的美丽红发女子的——集中注意力，碇！"呃……很高兴见到你。"

"Good to meet you too, young analogue-of-my-father. It's considered polite good form in the Empire to look out for your 'other selves' if they're new or seem at a loss. Family is important to us. Mom and dad are on leave right now, so when I heard about your visit to our mate-ship, I thought I'd uphold the family name and look in on you. I'm betting your counterpart to my mom is running you a bit ragged. Anything I could do to help?"

也很高兴见到你，年轻的我父亲对应体。在帝国，如果遇到初来乍到或显得迷茫的“另一个自己”，给予关照被视为礼貌之举。家庭对我们很重要。我父母现在休假，所以听说你要来我们的伴侣船，我想维护家族名誉，来看看你。我猜你对应我母亲的那位可能让你忙得团团转。有什么我能帮忙的吗？

Shinji looked back down the hallway. The door to the room where Asuka's mother slept was open, but the angle prevented him from seeing anything. He turned back to... Commander Ikari. "Ah, n-no, nothing I can think of. I'm sorry."

真嗣回头望向走廊深处。明日香母亲所在房间的门敞开着，但角度所限，他无法窥见任何东西。他转回身面对……伊卡里指挥官。“啊，不，没什么，我想不到什么。对不起。”

"Yup, you sound like mom's stories. This is kind of funny on my end too. You're what, about twenty? I've got kids your age. But anyway, there is something I can give you that I think might help you out. Mom sometimes mentions how rough it was for her and dad early on, how hard it was to get together despite how much they were attracted to each other, due to all the Scheiße they'd been through in their Angel War...so I wanted to give you something to give you some confidence, something to remind you that there's a better future still ahead." She glanced at her chair's right armrest and pressed a control. An electric blue sparkle flared on the table in front of the couch, fading into a small book-shaped box of polished wood. The cover had an enameled ship's badge on it. "A little gift from semi-family who crew your namesake ship. I do hope you come visit us too, Ikari-san. We are always ready at your back. Have fun, and if you do think of something, call me at any need."

嗯，你说话的口气跟妈妈的故事很像。在我这边听起来也挺有趣的。你大概二十岁左右吧？我的孩子都跟你差不多大了。不过，我倒是有样东西，我觉得或许能帮到你。妈妈有时会提起她和爸爸早年的艰辛，尽管彼此深爱，却因天使战争中的种种磨难而难以相聚。所以我想送你一份礼物，给你一些信心，提醒你未来仍有美好在等着你。"她瞥了一眼椅子的右扶手，按下一个控制键。沙发前的桌子上闪现出一道电蓝色的光芒，逐渐消散后留下一个精致的小木盒，形状像本书。盒盖上镶嵌着一枚珐琅制的船徽。"这是来自你同名舰船上的半亲人们的一点心意。真希望你也能来拜访我们，碇先生。我们随时都在你身后支持你。玩得开心，如果有任何需要，随时给我打电话。"

Shinji picked up the box and examined the cover badge. 'HMS Shinji Ikari' the top read in English lettering. The badge image was a shot of Eva Unit-01's head against a black, starry background, with himself in his plugsuit in front of it, a far more fearsome look on his face than he'd ever seen in a mirror. A bit more unusual was the motto at the bottom. It was in proper kanji and hiragana for a change, and read 'Here I Stand And Here I Remain'. 'Sounds a little better than 'I Mustn't Run Away', I guess,' he thought. "Um, thank you," he said to the smiling woman.

真嗣拿起盒子，仔细端详封面徽章。顶部用英文写着“HMS 真嗣·碇”。徽章图案是零号机头部置于黑色星空背景前，自己身穿插入栓服站在其前方，脸上流露出比镜中更为严峻的神情。底部铭文则稍显特别，这次采用了规范的汉字与平假名，写着“我在此立誓，亦将永驻此地”。“听起来比‘我不能逃’要好一些吧，”他暗自思忖。“嗯，谢谢您，”他对那位面带微笑的女士说道。

"Look inside." 往里看。

Shinji opened the cover. Inside was a family photo. 'He' was in it. That Shinji, looking at least twenty or more years older than him, sat on a plush couch, his arms around a distinctive red-haired woman. The 'Commander Ikari' he was talking to was standing behind the couch in the same black uniform, flanked by five apparent siblings, male and female, with multiple different uniforms, but matching features. On the outside stood various men and women he guessed were their husbands and wives. In front of the couch an entire baseball team's worth of young kids clustered at their feet. Grandchildren? More than a few redheads, but most had his dark brown. They all were beaming at the camera. Well, except for the kids who were trying to give each other bunny ears or staring off to the side.

真嗣打开了封面，里面是一张全家福。'他'也在其中。照片中的真嗣，看起来比他至少年长二十岁，坐在一张豪华沙发上，手臂环绕着一位醒目的红发女子。与他交谈的“碇司令”站在沙发后，身着同样的黑色制服，两侧站着五位显然是兄弟姐妹的男女，他们穿着各式制服，但面容相似。外围站着一些男女，他猜测是他们的配偶。沙发前，一群小孩聚集在他们的脚边，足足有一个棒球队那么多。是孙子孙女吗？其中不乏红发的孩子，但大多数继承了他的深棕色头发。他们所有人都对着镜头微笑。当然，除了那些试图互相做兔耳手势或眼神游离的孩子。

On the inside of the cover was a note. 'Family is always with you. You get what you give, so give it all. And don't forget to push back! -Love, the Sohryu-Ikari family PS: You have to send us yours in 30 years! June 6th, 2375 MR43, Iacon City, Vilya'

封面内侧夹着一张便条：“家人永远与你同在。你付出什么，就会收获什么，所以倾尽全力吧。别忘了要勇于反抗！——爱你的，惣流-碇家 附言：三十年后你也要寄给我们哦！2375 年 6 月 6 日 MR43，维利亚，艾康市”

Shinji spent a few seconds looking at 'himself' and 'Asuka'. He looked happy. She wore the same smile 'his' Asuka had so briefly worn on the beach this morning. Shinji closed his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat. "Thank you for the gift."

真嗣凝视着“自己”和“明日香”几秒钟。他看起来很幸福。她带着今早在海滩上“他的”明日香曾短暂展露过的同样笑容。真嗣闭上眼睛，咽下了喉咙里的哽咽。“谢谢你的礼物。”

"Shinji, who are you talking t-..." Asuka said as she came out of the hallway. She trailed off to a halt as she saw the screen. "Is... is that 'me'?"

“真嗣，你在和谁说话……”明日香从走廊里走出来时说道。当她看到屏幕时，话音戛然而止。“那……那是‘我’吗？”

"Hi mom!" "嗨，妈妈！"

Shinji covered his face. He knew he was somehow going to pay for this too.

真嗣捂住了脸。他知道，自己这次也免不了要为此付出代价。

'Then again, this may be worth it,' Shinji thought to himself two hours later. Asuka had declared she wanted to go swimming in the waters surrounding their beach house after the cheerful teasing of 'Commander Ikari' had prodded her from a blank mask over an unfathomable mood into aggravated counter-snarking. Asuka had growled when their caller had finally bid farewell, and announced that only a swim would clear her mind. A simple search of their bedroom's dressers had quickly turned up a selection of swimwear, and it had not done Shinji's blood pressure any favors when Asuka had emerged in a close copy of that red-and-white striped two-piece she'd worn the day before they'd fought Sandalphon in the depths of Mount Asama. The extra four years of growth since then had only added to her curves in all the best possible places. 'Wow.'

两个小时后，真嗣暗自思忖：“不过，这或许值得。”明日香在“碇司令”欢快的调侃下，从一副难以捉摸的面无表情转为激动的反唇相讥，随后宣布想去海边别墅周围的水域游泳。当通话终于结束时，明日香低吼一声，宣称只有游泳才能让她头脑清醒。他们在卧室的抽屉里迅速翻找出几件泳装，而当明日香穿着那件与之前在浅间山深处与桑德枫战斗前一天所穿的红色白条纹比基尼极为相似的泳装出现时，真嗣的血压并未因此得到缓解。这四年来，她的身材在最佳之处愈发丰满，令人惊叹。

Asuka had merely smirked triumphantly at his stunned silence, and ordered the beach house to provide her with scuba gear and accessories. It had made him feel more comfortable to note the return of a bit of the same spark in her eyes as she'd had back then beside the NERV HQ pool. It also terrified him, just like back then. Her arch comment about his own bone-dry swimsuit and t-shirt combination had been like old times too.

明日香只是得意地对他那震惊的沉默笑了笑，并命令海滩别墅为她提供潜水装备和配件。注意到她眼中再次闪现出当初在 NERV 总部泳池旁的那种光芒，让他感到些许安心。这也同样令他感到害怕，就像那时一样。她关于他那干巴巴的泳裤和 T 恤搭配的尖锐评论，也像是回到了往昔时光。

Once kitted out, she'd happily waded into the lapping wavelets and disappeared under the crystal clear water. A BH-provided pair of sunglasses and binoculars let him easily follow her around the shallow waters between their island and its neighbors. Still never having learned to swim, he had to be satisfied with watching her dart around like a redheaded mermaid. He was watching her for safety's sake, really. Not at all because that swimsuit had his eyes completely glued to her tight, bouncy—'Oh, who are you kidding, Ikari? She looks hotter than the sand out here feels, and you can't stop staring.'

装备齐全后，她便开心地踏入轻拍岸边的细浪，消失在清澈见底的水中。由 BH 提供的一副太阳镜和望远镜让他能轻松地在岛屿及其邻近浅水区追踪她的身影。尽管自己仍未学会游泳，他只能满足于观看她如红发美人鱼般穿梭。他其实是在确保她的安全，真的。绝不是因为那件泳装让他目不转睛地盯着她紧致、弹跳的——“哦，你在骗谁呢，碇？她看起来比这里的沙子还要热辣，你根本无法移开视线。”

He lowered the binoculars and flopped his head back against the beach chair he'd taken up station in under another umbrella a short bit down the shore from their cabin. Gods, she was so beautiful. If only...

他放下双筒望远镜，将头重重地靠在沙滩椅上，这把椅子是他从离小屋不远处的另一把遮阳伞下搬来的。天啊，她真是美极了。要是……

He frowned. She was apparently enjoying herself, popping up out of the water every so often to wave at him, and shout half-heard things about the fish she was seeing or something. But before she'd been teased by 'Commander Ikari', he'd seen that mask-like expression on her face again, her eyes as stormy as her face was calm. She had not said a word to him that indicated in the slightest that she had any awareness of what he'd done while she slept to try to quiet her nightmares. When she woke this morning she was cool and as brittle as the day before. Then she showed up to beat his father over the head and she was cheery and bouncy. She took him for a ride in her new toy, and apologized for something. He'd wildly overshot on his reply, but she hadn't exploded at him, just quietly and forcefully accepted his oath to never abandon her again. She'd been like a starlet in the spotlight before the bay full of cheering crew, then suddenly had them both transported back here without another word after something made her stiffen. She'd been crying in her sleep, clinging to him like a safety blanket, then left him sleeping like she hadn't noticed. She was flipping back and forth between different Asukas, and he had no idea how to react to any of them. 'Then again, it's not like you were ever very good at figuring out what was going on in her head even when she was the same all day long. Except for when it came to coming up with exactly the wrong thing to say or do. Then you were a damn expert.'

他皱起眉头。她显然玩得很开心，时不时从水中冒出来向他挥手，大声说着她看到的鱼或别的什么，声音半清不楚。但在被“伊卡洛斯指挥官”逗弄之前，他又看到了她脸上那副面具般的表情，眼神如风暴般汹涌，而面容却异常平静。她没有向他透露丝毫意识到他在她熟睡时所做的努力，试图平息她的噩梦。今早醒来时，她冷淡而脆弱，一如昨日。随后她出现，对他的父亲大发雷霆，又变得欢快活泼。她带他体验了她的新玩具，并为某事道歉。他的回答过于激烈，但她并未爆发，只是平静而坚定地接受了他的誓言，承诺永不再抛弃她。她在满是欢呼船员的港湾前，如同聚光灯下的明星，随后因某事突然僵硬，一言不发地将两人传送回此地。她在睡梦中哭泣，紧抓着他如同抓住安全毯，然后又悄然离开，仿佛未曾察觉。 她不断在不同的明日香之间切换，而他完全不知道该如何应对任何一种。'话说回来，即使她整天保持一致，你也从没擅长过揣摩她的心思。除了在说出或做出完全错误的事情时，那时你简直是该死的高手。'

So now what? His own six-months-older self had implicitly showed him that he and Asuka could be apparently quite happy together, a message weirdly reinforced by a call from the daughter of yet another alternate of himself. He still felt like he was trying to walk a tightrope blindfolded. He didn't know what to do! He could feel Asuka's strain at times. She'd go so rigid she was almost vibrating. This morning on the beach she'd looked like someone had just shot her dog. 'And what did you do, Ikari? Nothing, that's what. 'Be there for her', 'you' said. Well, that would have been a good time, jackass!' Next time, he'd- 'Next time? That's what you said last time. How soon is now?' Hey, I did reach out and help her just now! 'In her sleep. What do you want, a damn cookie? And again with Asuka while she's unconscious! How about while she's got her eyes open next time?'

那现在怎么办？比他大六个月的自己已经暗示了他和明日香可以明显地过得很幸福，而来自另一个自己的女儿的电话又奇怪地强化了这一信息。他仍感觉自己像是在蒙着眼睛走钢丝。他不知道该怎么办！有时他能感受到明日香的紧张。她会变得如此僵硬，几乎在颤抖。今天早上在海滩上，她看起来就像有人刚射杀了她的狗。“你做了什么，碇？什么也没做，就是这样。”“在她身边”，“你”说。好吧，那本该是个好时机，蠢货！下次，他会——“下次？你上次也是这么说的。现在有多快？”嘿，我刚才确实伸出手帮了她！“在她睡觉的时候。你想要什么，一块该死的饼干？又是明日香昏迷的时候！下次她睁开眼睛的时候怎么办？”

Shinji sighed. He wished some of the boiling self-loathing he could lash himself with could finally be turned, if not into a useful impulse to do something in time to make a difference, at least outward onto some deserving target. Instead it just sloshed around inside him until it built up so high that he snapped at some final straw. 'Maybe I should go beat the stuffing out of my father again. Even if it's not exactly productive, it felt good and he certainly deserves it.'

真嗣叹了口气。他多么希望那些沸腾的自我厌恶，那些他可以用来鞭笞自己的情绪，最终能转化为哪怕不是及时行动的有用冲动，至少也能向外发泄到某个应得的目标上。然而，这些情绪只是在他内心翻腾，直到积累到一定程度，最终因为某根最后的稻草而爆发。“或许我应该再去痛打父亲一顿。虽然这并不算什么建设性的行为，但感觉很好，他确实活该。”

Asuka's splashing up out of the water towards him broke him out of his introspection. Shinji's eyes told the rest of him to shut up and pay attention; Aphrodite was being born out of the waves again. Shinji watched in rapt fascination as she walked up past the high tide line, shrugging off the scuba tank to drop it next to the other beach chair under the umbrella. She stretched her hands over her head and arched her back right in front of Shinji, like she was taking care to flaunt her newly scar-free stomach and perfect body at him. She relaxed from her stretch to give him a very knowing stare. "Having fun, Third? Enjoying the view?"

明日香从水中跃出，朝他泼水，打断了他的沉思。真嗣的眼神告诉自己要闭嘴并集中注意力；阿佛洛狄忒仿佛再次从波浪中诞生。他目不转睛地注视着她走过高潮线，卸下潜水罐，将其放在遮阳伞下的另一把沙滩椅旁。她双手高举过头，在真嗣面前优雅地弓背伸展，仿佛刻意炫耀她那新近无疤的腹部和完美身躯。伸展完毕后，她放松下来，用一种了然于心的眼神凝视着他，“玩得开心吗，第三适格者？这景色还满意吗？”

Shinji finally realized that he was still staring at her, and snapped his eyes away. "I'm sor—"

真嗣终于意识到自己还在盯着她看，急忙移开目光。“对不——”

"You say 'I'm sorry', and I'm throwing you into the lagoon," she said, irritation edging into her voice.

你说“对不起”，我就把你扔进泻湖，”她说道，声音中带着一丝恼怒。

"I'm—" 'Do you have a death wish, Ikari?' "...very much enjoying myself, yes. I'm happy for you."

"我——" '碇，你是活腻了吗？' "...非常享受，是的。我为你感到高兴。"

Asuka looked like she'd heard that little mental swerve, but blinked at the borderline compliment from the usually quiet young man. "Happy for me?"

明日香似乎听到了那突如其来的心声转折，但对这位平日沉默寡言的年轻人近乎赞美的言语眨了眨眼。“为我高兴吗？”

"All those marks you got in the...the fight with the SEELE's Evas. They're gone now, and you are wearing that suit. And, um, you really look good." Shinji fought to keep his voice from turning into a squeak. "It's good to see you getting to swim again."

你在与 SEELE 的 EVA 战斗中留下的那些痕迹，现在都消失了，你穿着那套泳装。呃，你看起来真的很棒。" 真嗣努力让自己的声音不变成尖细的颤音。"看到你又能游泳了，真好。

"Not a lot of chances for swimming pools or scuba in the last few years," Asuka replied tartly. "But yes, I really didn't feel like showing off all the scarring the MP Evas left me with. Now that's gone, and I'm whole again. Hooray." She dropped into the chair next to his.

"这几年游泳池和潜水的机会不多，"明日香尖锐地回答，"不过没错，我确实不想展示那些 MP 使徒给我留下的疤痕。现在那些都没了，我又完整了。万岁。"她坐到了他旁边的椅子上。

They both stared out at the gently lapping waters and weirdly distant horizon for a minute before Asuka spoke up again. "Those old broken bones the doctor mentioned this morning... Daniel said you got them from Winthrop's guards beating you after... after you... tried to convince him to take you instead of me? In Boston?" she asked hesitantly.

两人凝视着轻拍岸边的水面和遥远得诡异的地平线，沉默了一分钟后，明日香再次开口：“医生今早提到的那些陈旧断骨……丹尼尔说，是温斯洛普的守卫在你……在你试图说服他带你而不是我之后，把你打伤的？在波士顿？”她迟疑地问道。

The tropical heat suddenly deserted Shinji and he felt cold. He slowly nodded. "Yes. He told me you'd 'volunteered' for his 'personal attentions'. I knew what he meant. The look on his face didn't even try to disguise it. I begged him not to do it. I offered to take your place, anything as long as he'd leave you alone. I think it just made him angry. He told the guards to 'teach me some respect'. I blacked out when one of them kicked me in the temple. You and he were gone before I came to. I was out for about a week, they told me. That's the last I saw of you for three years until they ordered Aoba to escort me to Berlin. I'm sorry. I failed you again. At least that time I tried, for all the good it did." Faint, anguished bitterness colored his voice as he finished. "I tried not to think of what he was doing to you while I was stuck in Boston. Sometimes I succeeded. That's part of why I started studying Philosophy; it took my mind off...things."

热带的酷热突然离真嗣而去，他感到一阵寒意。他缓缓地点了点头，“是的。他告诉我，你‘自愿’接受他的‘特别关照’。我明白他的意思。他脸上的表情甚至懒得掩饰。我恳求他不要这么做。我提出代替你，只要他放过你，我什么都愿意做。我想这反而激怒了他。他命令守卫‘教我学会尊重’。其中一个守卫踢中我的太阳穴时，我昏了过去。我醒来之前，你和他已经不见了。他们告诉我，我昏迷了大约一周。那是我三年里最后一次见到你，直到他们命令青叶护送我前往柏林。对不起，我又让你失望了。至少那次我尝试了，尽管没什么用。”他结束时，声音中带着淡淡的、痛苦的苦涩。“我被困在波士顿时，尽量不去想他对你的所作所为。有时候我能做到。这也是我开始研究哲学的原因之一；它让我暂时忘却那些事情。”

Asuka kept staring out to sea for a long time. "Thank you for trying," she said quietly after a while. "You didn't... fail me, Third, I did. I made the choice to go to Winthrop. I thought it was necessary for my own protection. I thought I was... making sure I wouldn't be killed. I didn't know about... your part. All I knew is we left for Berlin and you didn't come, and I didn't hear anything from you at all. Just secondhand bits when people reported to Winthrop, like with the Philosophy professor thing. I... was pretty mad at you for abandoning me again."

明日香长时间凝视着大海。过了一会儿，她轻声说道：“谢谢你尝试了。”“你没有……让我失望，第三，是我自己。我选择了去温沃斯，以为那是为了自我保护的必要之举。我以为我在……确保自己不会被杀。我并不知道……你的那部分。我只知道我们去了柏林，而你没有来，我完全没有收到你的任何消息。只有人们向温沃斯报告时传来的二手信息，比如那个哲学教授的事情。我……对你再次抛弃我感到非常愤怒。”

"But I didn't!" Shinji protested.

"但我没有！" 真嗣抗议道。

Asuka snapped her head around to glare right at him. "I fucking know that now, Third! And now I know that my 'choice' got you beat unconscious and may have been pointless!" Asuka shut her mouth with a snap and suddenly looked away.

明日香猛地转头瞪着他，厉声说道：“我现在他妈的知道了，老三！而且我现在知道，我的所谓‘选择’让你被打得不省人事，可能还毫无意义！”明日香啪地一声闭上嘴，突然别过头去。

Shinji watched the back of her head, waiting for her to continue. "Pointless?" he asked once it became clear she wasn't going to immediately resume.

真嗣注视着她的后脑勺，等待她继续说下去。“毫无意义？”当意识到她不会立即继续时，他问道。

She kept looking at the horizon away from him. "Winthrop... lost interest in me after about a year. He 'gave me' to Jinnai. Jinnai was...less bad than Winthrop. He kept me sane, anyway. But I still... I still had accepted the 'choice' I made. You didn't do that. I did. And now... now I'm fucking innocent of a sin I still committed, or chose to, at least."

她一直凝视着远离他的地平线。“温思罗普……大约一年后对我失去了兴趣。他将我‘让给’了阵内。阵内……比温思罗普好一些。无论如何，他让我保持了理智。但我仍然……我仍然接受了那个‘选择’。你没有那样做。我做了。而现在……现在我对于一个我仍然犯下，或至少选择去犯的罪行，却他妈的成了无辜者。”

'Innocent?' "Asuka, what are you talking about?"

'无辜？' "明日香，你在说什么？"

"...He made it un-happen."

"...他让它未曾发生。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"Daniel. This morning, while we were doing our separate things, he made it not have happened, at least not how I thought it did," she said, her voice somewhere between guilt and confusion. "He made a dummy, switched it for me every time they would have... taken me. He did it hundreds of times. I'm... untouched, now, completely intact. Again." She paused for a moment and gave a disgusted snort. "'Not intact everywhere', she said. I'm a verdammt comedienne."

丹尼尔。今早，当我们各自忙碌时，他让那件事仿佛未曾发生，至少不是我以为的那样，”她说道，声音夹杂着内疚与困惑。“他制作了一个假人，每次他们本该带走我时，就用它替换了我。他这样做了数百次。我现在……完好无损，彻底未被触碰。又一次。”她停顿片刻，发出一声厌恶的嗤笑。“‘并非处处完好’，她说。我真是个该死的喜剧演员。”

She abruptly stood up and grabbed the scuba gear. "I'm going to shower off the salt," she said as she rapidly walked towards the cabin without looking back.

她突然站起来，抓起潜水装备。“我要去洗掉身上的盐分，”她说着，快步向船舱走去，没有回头。

Part 20 第 20 章

Kung-Fu Flirting 功夫调情

Shinji sat on the beach chair staring at the seagulls himself for a good while, trying to unpack Asuka's cryptic revelations. She 'chose' to go to Winthrop? It wasn't hard to tell how much of a 'choice' it was. Their various warlord-hosts before Winthrop had often been the kind to 'give you a choice' with a gun in their hand. The only difference with Winthrop was he had N2 mines.

真嗣坐在沙滩椅上，凝视着海鸥良久，试图解开明日香那番隐晦的启示。她“选择”去温索普？不难看出这“选择”有多少自由。在温索普之前的那些军阀主人，常常是那种“给你选择”时手里拿着枪的人。与温索普唯一的不同，是他拥有 N2 地雷。

'"He made it un-happen."' So Daniel had somehow... what, un-raped her? A dummy, switched in... intact, she said... His eyes popped open. 'Wait, does that mean she's back to...I mean still a virgin? What does that mean?' No wonder she'd been so... withdrawn, on their one attempt at sex. 'Wait, no, that was before Daniel came. She still thought she was... she was just hating it anyhow.' Gods, the look on her face... it felt like he was violating her. He couldn't do that to her. But she still offered, even after that. Why? She couldn't want him to hurt her, not like that.

"他让它未曾发生。" 所以丹尼尔不知怎么地...什么，撤销了那次强奸？用一个假人替换...完好无损，她说的...他的眼睛猛地睁开。"等等，那是否意味着她回到了...我是说还是处女？这到底意味着什么？" 难怪她之前在唯一一次尝试性爱时那么...退缩。"等等，不，那是在丹尼尔来之前。她仍然以为自己是...她只是无论如何都讨厌它。" 天啊，她脸上的表情...感觉就像他在侵犯她。他不能那样对她。但她仍然主动提出，即便在那之后。为什么？她不可能希望他那样伤害她，绝不会。

He was just giving himself a headache like this. He stood up and headed inside. The sound of the shower told him where Asuka was. He stood in the living room and thought. Wait, there was something he wanted to find out about; where were his parents?

他这样只会让自己头疼。他站起身，朝屋内走去。淋浴的声音告诉他明日香在哪里。他站在客厅里沉思。等等，有件事他想弄清楚；他的父母在哪里？

He faced the black screen and asked, "BH, can I call my mother and father?"

他面对着漆黑的屏幕问道：“BH，我能给爸爸妈妈打电话吗？”

The screen came to life with the heraldic shield emblem and "CALLING" flashed at the bottom. After a few seconds, the shield vanished and Rayana looked at him. "Hello, Shinji. I'm sorry, your mother is not available right now." There was the sound of breaking glass from somewhere behind her and a woman's scream of 'How COULD you? How could you DO that to him? How could you do that to HER? THREE TIMES?' Rayana looked off to her right, and turned back to him. "They're having a... ah... frank discussion at the moment."

屏幕亮起，出现了纹章盾徽，底部闪烁着"呼叫中"的字样。几秒后，盾徽消失，雷亚娜看向他。"你好，真嗣。很抱歉，你妈妈现在没空。"她身后某处传来玻璃破碎声和一位女性的尖叫：'你怎么能这样？你怎么能对他那样？你怎么能对她那样？三次了？'雷亚娜向右瞥了一眼，然后转回来看着他。"他们现在正进行一场……呃……坦率的讨论。"

"Can I talk to my mother later?" he asked hopefully.

"我晚点能和我妈妈说话吗？"他满怀希望地问道。

"She'll be" ~CRASH~ "there at the dinner. I think your father..." Shinji heard his father's voice in the background. "I HAD to! It was the only way!" "...will be staying in tonight. Your mother is not very happy with him. She'll explain more then," Rayana concluded.

"她会" ~砰~ "在晚宴上。我想你父亲..." 真嗣听到他父亲在背景中的声音。 "我不得不这么做！这是唯一的办法！" "...今晚不会出门。你母亲对他很不满意。她到时候会解释更多，" 蕾雅娜总结道。

Shinji tried not to show his disappointment. "I see. Thank you, Rayana. You'll come get us then?"

真嗣尽量不表现出失望。“我明白了。谢谢你，雷亚娜。那你来接我们吗？”

"That we shall. Just try to relax, talk to Asuka for a bit. We'll see you this evening."

我们会的。试着放松一下，和明日香聊会儿天。我们晚上见。

'I think those two things are mutually exclusive.' Shinji thought morosely. "Thank you. Goodbye." The screen went black once more.

“我认为这两件事是互斥的。” 真嗣闷闷不乐地想。“谢谢你。再见。” 屏幕再次变黑。

Relaxed was the last thing he felt like right now. Hearing his parents apparently having a screaming match plus Asuka's unsettling information had left him feeling unable to sit still. He jittered around the room for a few minutes before deciding to try sweating off some of his energy. He found a gi in the bedroom wardrobe, changed while Asuka was still showering, and went to the cabin's workout room.

此刻，他感到的绝非放松。父母的争吵声不绝于耳，加上明日香带来的令人不安的消息，让他坐立难安。他在房间里来回踱步了几分钟，最终决定通过锻炼来消耗一些精力。他在卧室衣柜里找到一件道服，趁明日香还在洗澡时换上，然后前往小屋的健身房。

Forty minutes of judo katas and exercise left him feeling considerably calmer. He came up from a set of sit-ups and caught a flicker of red out of the corner of his eye. He turned to find Asuka leaning against the doorframe in her own red gi, her hair already tied up.

四十分钟的柔道型和锻炼让他感到平静了许多。他从一组仰卧起坐中起身，眼角余光瞥见一抹红色闪过。他转头一看，发现明日香正倚在门框上，穿着她自己的红色柔道服，头发已经束好。

"Feel like a few rounds, Third?" she challenged.

"来几轮怎么样，老三？" 她挑衅道。

Shinji paused, still breathing a little harder than when he'd started most of an hour ago. He was a little worn down, but he could tell Asuka needed to blow off nervous energy at least as much as he had. And the way her face would relax sometimes in their bouts was almost worth it by itself to be able to see. Her face had the sharp clarity of a knife blade at such times, scary and beautiful, blessedly absent of the tension and bitterness that marked it too often otherwise. "Sure, Asuka." He took up a ready stance in the middle of the mats.

真嗣停了下来，呼吸比一个小时前开始时还要急促一些。他感到有些疲惫，但他能看出明日香至少和他一样需要释放紧张的能量。而且，在他们交手时，她脸上偶尔露出的放松表情，几乎就足以让人感到值得。那时她的面容如刀刃般清晰锐利，既令人畏惧又美丽，庆幸地摆脱了平日里常有的紧张和苦涩。“当然，明日香。”他在垫子中央摆好了准备姿势。

She stepped to opposite him, and brought her hands up. Neither one of them moved for a second. Asuka took the initiative and tried for a leg sweep. Shinji evaded and reached for her right arm, but she spun out of the way.

她迈步站到他对面，双手抬起。两人静止了一秒。明日香主动出击，试图扫腿。真嗣躲开并伸手抓她右臂，但她旋身避开了。

Shinji managed two throws by occasionally surprising her, but was well aware his style remained mostly technical and defensive. Asuka kept pressing the attack, catching him well enough several times for two throws of her own, plus a couple more holds that forced him to tap out. Shinji grimaced internally as he once again passed up an exploitable opening for a conversion to a choke pin. He'd found himself shying away from such maneuvers ever since their first match. The choke then had awakened too many ugly echoes for both of them. 'Damn it. Another thing to apologize for; 'I'm sorry I tried to choke you to death because I was crazy from ending the world.''

真嗣偶尔出其不意地完成了两次投掷，但他深知自己的风格仍以技术性和防御性为主。明日香持续进攻，多次抓住机会，不仅成功反制两次，还施加了几次迫使他认输的擒拿。真嗣内心苦笑，又一次错过了转化为扼颈固定的好机会。自从他们的首场比赛后，他发现自己越来越回避这类动作。那次扼颈唤醒了两人心中太多不堪的回响。“该死，又多了一件需要道歉的事；‘对不起，我曾因世界末日而疯狂，试图将你扼死。’”

At least her face had relaxed again. He tried not to spend too much time staring. He'd made that mistake before, and Asuka had ruthlessly exploited it. His back still twinged in painful memory. He passed up another attack opening. This time Asuka growled.

至少她的表情又恢复了平静。他尽量不让自己盯着看太久。他以前犯过这样的错误，而明日香则无情地利用了这一点。他背上的痛楚仍在记忆中隐隐作痛。他再次放弃了攻击的机会。这次，明日香低吼了一声。

"Damn it, Third, come at me! I'm not made of glass!" She followed up with a couple of faster than usual kicks at his head, pushing into his space. He caught her foot on the last one, flipping her over and moving into a pin. She twisted and bucked against the mat, trying to throw him off, but failing. Once he had the pin incontestably established, she slapped the mat in surrender.

该死，老三，来啊！我又不是玻璃做的！" 她紧接着以比平时更快的速度朝他的头部踢去，逼近他的空间。最后一脚被他抓住，顺势将她翻转并压制住。她在垫子上扭动挣扎，试图将他甩开，却未能成功。一旦他无可争议地确立了压制，她便拍垫认输。

They rolled apart and stood, panting. Asuka glared at him. "Quit making me do all the work, Third! Fight me! Hit me!"

他们分开后站起身，喘着粗气。明日香怒视着他。“别让我一个人忙活，三号！跟我打！打我！”

"It's hard! I don't like feeling like I'm going to hurt you!"

这太难了！我不喜欢感觉自己会伤害到你！

"It's a fucking judo sparring match, not a knife fight! Hit me!" She swung at his head again. "'It's hard!'" she mocked. "'I might hurt you!' Well, fuck, Third, who ever told you anything in this life was easy was lying to you!" A snap kick connected with his gut and knocked him stumbling back to a fall. "You want something, you have to push for it!" She pounced and tried to pin him before he could rise.

这他妈是柔道对练，不是刀战！打我啊！" 她再次挥拳向他的头部。"'太难了！'" 她嘲讽道。"'我可能会伤到你！' 得了吧，老三，谁要是告诉你这世上的事容易，那他就是在骗你！" 一记快踢正中他的腹部，将他击退几步跌倒在地。"想要什么，就得去争取！" 她趁势扑上去，试图在他起身前将他制服。

Shinji rolled out from under her leap and jumped back to his feet, his seldom roused pride sparking to life again. "Fine!" He went on the offensive, catching Asuka off guard. After an exchange of blows, he caught her wrist when she tried a block and spun her into an arm bar. "That more like it?" he asked angrily.

真嗣从她的跳跃下滚出，迅速站起身来，他那难得激起的自尊心再次燃起。“好！”他转守为攻，让明日香措手不及。经过一番交手，在她试图格挡时抓住了她的手腕，将她旋转成一个手臂锁。“这样满意了吗？”他愤怒地问道。

Shinji was puzzled as he saw a smile crawl onto her face.

当真嗣看到她的脸上慢慢爬上一抹微笑时，他感到困惑不解。

"Didn't we have a deal, Third? You give me everything I want, and take what I give you?" She suddenly wiggled and somehow slid out of the arm bar. She was on him again almost before Shinji could recover, punches and kicks coming as fast as he could handle. "I reserve the right to change my mind, you know. Things can change. Things changed today. Things could change more tonight. Tomorrow could be a whole new deal..." She was driving him back, blow by blow towards the door to the room. Asuka tapped into a new top gear and threw even faster moves at him. "If you wanna 'love me', Third, you better be ready! to! push! BACK!" She grabbed his lapels and threw herself backwards as she stuck her foot in his stomach. The throw sent him halfway across the room to slam into the mat. Shinji lay there, too stunned to move, and watched upside-down as Asuka walked out the door without a backwards glance. "I'm going for a walk. Tschüsch."

我们不是有协议吗，真嗣？我给你我想要的一切，你接受我给你的东西。"她突然扭动身体，不知怎么地从手臂束缚中滑了出来。她几乎在真嗣还没反应过来时就再次扑向他，拳脚如疾风骤雨般袭来。"你要知道，我有权改变主意。事情会变的。今天事情就变了。今晚可能还会有更多变化。明天可能就是全新的局面了……"她一步步将他逼向房间的门口。明日香切换到新的极限速度，向他发起更迅猛的攻势。"如果你想'爱我'，真嗣，你最好准备好！反！抗！"她抓住他的衣领，向后一跃，同时一脚踹在他的肚子上。这一摔将他抛到房间的另一头，重重地撞在垫子上。真嗣躺在那里，惊呆了无法动弹，倒看着明日香头也不回地走出房门。"我去散个步。再见。"

Asuka was making great time, heading nowhere. She'd snatched Shinji's sunglasses off the kitchen counter as she passed, and shot out the door. Her 'walk' rapidly evolved into a full on sprint, the sand flying up under her toes. She wasn't running away exactly, she was just running.

明日香正以极快的速度，朝着无目的地方前进。她顺手从厨房台面上抓走了真嗣的太阳镜，然后冲出了门。她的“行走”迅速演变成了全力冲刺，沙子在她脚趾下飞扬。她并非在逃避，只是单纯地在奔跑。

Her breath came rapidly, her body humming. Half of her mind wanted to giggle madly over the look in the Third's face as she hit him with that last statement and her own audacity in doing so. The other half wanted to just panic over that last statement and her own madness in doing so. 'What the Hell am I doing? Why did I say that?'

她的呼吸急促，身体微微颤抖。一半的心思想要为最后那句话击中第三者时他脸上的表情，以及自己如此大胆的行为而疯狂窃笑。另一半则因那句话和自己的疯狂行为而想要惊慌失措。'我到底在做什么？为什么要说那样的话？'

It hadn't been something she planned. It had just slipped out when her blood got going in that match. He'd been his usual passive, defensive self, passing up easy openings over and over. She'd pushed at him just to get him to push back. Sometimes she'd been able to goad him into anger back in Misato's apartment. She'd push and poke until he blew a fuse and started to push back at her. For some reason that always made her feel alive, alive in a way she hadn't felt since her violation at the hands of the 15th Angel, like every nerve was lit up. If she couldn't have enough of those rare moments where she could display her superiority over the Third, she could at least grab a few where he'd at least show some energy and fight back with her.

这并非她有意为之。只是在那场比赛中，热血上涌，话便脱口而出。他一如既往地被动防守，一次次错失良机。她不断挑衅，只为激他反击。有时在美里家，她能成功激怒他。她不断推搡、挑逗，直至他爆发，开始与她对抗。不知何故，这总让她感到生机勃勃，自第十五使徒侵犯后未曾有过的感觉，仿佛每根神经都被点燃。若无法拥有足够多展现对第三适格者优越感的珍贵时刻，至少也要抓住几个，让他至少展现出些许活力，与她抗衡。

But this was a little different. There hadn't been any 'arrangement' back in those days. Just the unspoken, nebulous boundaries you'd find between members of the opposite sex sharing a house. Now, tonight, just like the month of nights before it, she'd be sleeping in the same bed as the boy she'd just maybe-kinda-sorta hinted to that he should...chase her a little.

但这次有些不同。那时候并没有什么“安排”。只是异性合租者之间那种不言而喻、模糊不清的界限。如今，今晚，就像之前一个月的每个夜晚一样，她将与那个她刚刚或许有点含蓄地暗示他应该……稍微追求一下她的男孩同床共枕。

'What the fuck was I thinking? I told him 'no' before. Why the Hell do I want him to come at me? I don't love him. I don't. I can't. I don't need him.' Sweat stung her eyes. Another beach house came into view ahead on her right. As she began to pass it, another figure in shorts and a swimsuit came out the door at an easy lope and matched speed with her.

我他妈当时在想什么？我之前已经拒绝过他了。为什么我还想让他来找我？我不爱他。我不爱。我不能。我不需要他。汗水刺痛了她的眼睛。前方右侧又出现了一栋海滨别墅。当她开始经过时，另一个穿着短裤和泳装的人轻松地跑出门，与她并肩而行。

"Howdy, stranger!" Ching greeted her. "Hmm, red gi, sprinting down the beach full speed, barefoot...I know, you're doing a martial arts movie training-montage gag! Shouldn't you do this at sunset for the maximum dramatic backdrop?" Ching was matching her headlong run, not even breathing hard.

"你好啊，陌生人！" 青向她打招呼。"嗯，红色道服，全速沿着海滩奔跑，赤脚...我知道了，你是在模仿武术电影里的训练蒙太奇吧！难道不应该选择在日落时分进行，以获得最戏剧化的背景吗？" 青与她并肩疾跑，连呼吸都未见急促。

"Har... har... every... one... on... this... fucking... planet... is... a... Gott… damn... comedian!" Asuka panted.

"哈...哈...这...个...该...死...的...星...球...上...的...每...个...人...都...是...个...该...死...的...喜...剧...演...员！" 明日香喘息着说。

"Blame Their Majesties. That whole Founder Effect; Snark is practically a holy art around here." Ching spun around to run backwards, facing her from a couple paces ahead. "More seriously, what's got you running out here today? You're moving like you've got bill collectors and the sheriff on your tail and you apparently just left your dojo in a hurry. What's chasing your afterburners so hard you didn't even stop to change?" Ching's eyebrows went up. "Did Shinji do something more than usually foolish? Or did you?"

怪他们的君主吧。那个所谓的奠基者效应；在这里，讽刺几乎成了一种神圣的艺术。" 青转身倒着跑，面对着她，距离几步之遥。"说正经的，今天是什么风把你吹到这儿来了？你跑得好像有债主和治安官在后面追似的，显然你是急匆匆地离开了道场。是什么让你这么拼命，连换衣服的时间都没有？" 青的眉毛挑了起来。"是真嗣又做了什么特别愚蠢的事吗？还是你？"

Asuka managed not to stumble. "I... just... felt... like a... run... after I... kicked... the... Third's... ass." Her pace was slowing. A long bout in the dojo with the Third after two hours of swimming around were finally adding up. After another half-mile, she jogged to a halt at the next set of beach chairs and collapsed into one, her chest pumping like bellows.

明日香总算没有绊倒。“我……只是……觉得……想跑一跑……在我……踢了……第三的……屁股之后。”她的步伐正在放缓。在道场与第三激烈对练后，再加上之前两小时的游泳，疲惫终于累积起来。又跑了半英里后，她在下一排沙滩椅旁慢跑停下，瘫坐在其中一张椅子上，胸口剧烈起伏，如同风箱一般。

Ching easily lowered herself into the other chair. She watched Asuka pant for a moment, then murmured something into her interface band. A pair of bottles sparkled into being on the chair beside her, and quickly grew a film of condensation. Ching opened one bottle and handed it to Asuka. "Here. Navy sports grog, better than Gatorade."

青轻松地坐进了另一把椅子。她看着飞鸟喘息了一会儿，随后对着自己的接口带低语了几句。两瓶饮料随即在旁边的椅子上闪现，并迅速凝结出一层水珠。青打开一瓶递给飞鸟：“给，海军运动饮料，比佳得乐好喝。”

Asuka took the chilled bottle and gratefully chugged the slightly tart liquid. Her stomach twitched, reminding her she hadn't had anything since the 'loaves and fishes' lunch joke. "Thanks," she gasped. She looked at Ching in surprise. She'd kept up with Asuka's best speed for over a mile, and showed not a drop of sweat or the slightest increase in breathing rate. "How are you cheating? You're not even breathing hard from that."

明日香接过冰凉的瓶子，感激地大口灌下那略带酸味的液体。她的胃一阵抽搐，提醒她自从那次“面包与鱼”的午餐玩笑后就没吃过东西。“谢谢，”她喘着气说。她惊讶地看着青，她竟然能跟上明日香最快的速度跑了一英里多，而且没有一滴汗，呼吸也没有丝毫加快。“你怎么作弊的？你甚至都没喘粗气。”

Ching smiled. "I'm active duty Navy. I've got a whole set of combat implants and nanoware boosters. On top of that, you're Homo Sapiens, I'm Homo Avalonis. It not really a fair contest. Even without my military gear, I could outrun cheetahs without much trouble."

青微笑道：“我是现役海军。我有一整套战斗植入体和纳米增强剂。除此之外，你是智人，而我是阿瓦隆人。这真的不是一场公平的较量。即使没有我的军用装备，我也能轻松跑赢猎豹。”

"You're not even human? No fair. And I was already tired, too."

你甚至不是人类？这不公平。而且我已经很累了。

Ching gave her a sharp look. "'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?' I'm human, Asuka, I'm just not Homo Sapiens. Mere species is neither the measure nor definition of humanity here. Human is as human does. There are plenty of people on this planet alone who don't have even a single codon of Homo Sapiens DNA in them, but are very human. And you know damn well there are plenty of people walking around on your world that are one hundred percent Homo Sapiens that are not human in the least. Be careful, some might take what you said as rather an insult."

青给她一个锐利的眼神。“‘如果我们被刺，难道不会流血吗？如果我们被逗，难道不会笑吗？如果我们中毒，难道不会死吗？如果我们被冤枉，难道我们不会复仇吗？’我是人，飞鸟，我只是不属于智人。仅仅的物种既不是衡量也不是定义这里的人性的标准。人如其行。仅在这个星球上，就有许多人身上没有智人的一个核苷酸，但他们非常人性化。而你非常清楚，在你的世界上，有许多百分百的智人，他们根本没有人性。小心点，有些人可能会把你刚才的话视为极大的侮辱。”

Asuka was a bit taken aback by Ching's sharp tone. "Sorry."

明日香对青的尖锐语气有些吃惊。“对不起。”

Ching's face relaxed and she waved Asuka's apprehension away. "Forget about it, you didn't know. So, you kicked his ass, hmm? And then ran out here? Are you sure you're 19? This almost sounds like kindergarten stuff; you pulled his pigtails and ran away because that's how you show him you like him," she said with a small grin.

青的脸色缓和下来，她挥手打消了明日香的担忧。“别放在心上，你之前不知道。所以，你揍了他一顿，嗯？然后就跑出来了？你确定你已经 19 岁了吗？这听起来简直像是幼儿园的把戏；你扯了他的辫子然后跑掉，这就是你表达喜欢他的方式。”她带着一丝微笑说道。

"I don't know what the heck I just did."

我不知道我刚才到底干了什么。

"Oh? Details, girl, details!" Ching said excitedly.

"哦？说详细点，姑娘，详细点！" 青激动地说。

"It's your fault anyway. Your little pep talk this morning really did cause 'the snowflake that starts the avalanche' alright. It damn near killed half the skiers on the hill. I apologized for a bitchy comment I made a month ago just to get under his skin. He apologized for failing to even try to come help me when I was fighting for my life against the whole Mass Production series! So much for starting small! The Third Child went from zero to Mach three, trying to apologize for the worst thing he ever did to me!" Asuka burst out.

反正都是你的错。你今早那番鼓舞人心的话确实引发了“那片引发雪崩的雪花”，差点害得山坡上一半的滑雪者丧命。我为一个月前的一句刻薄话道歉，只是为了刺激他。他则为自己在我与整个量产系列拼命时，连尝试来帮忙都没有而道歉！说好的从微小处开始呢！第三适格者从零直接飙到三倍音速，拼命为他对我的最糟糕行为道歉！" 明日香爆发道。

Ching blinked "He did? Wow. I'm... kind of impressed."

青眨了眨眼：“他真的这么做了？哇，我有点佩服他了。”

Asuka gave her a funny look.

明日香给了她一个滑稽的眼神。

Ching shrugged. "It must have been eating him up inside, Asuka. That is a big deal to apologize for. For him to just come out with it like that, right off the bat, it must have been on his mind. I didn't think he'd find the resolve to do that for a while yet." Ching tilted her head. "So, did you forgive him?"

青耸了耸肩。“那一定让他内心煎熬不已，明日香。道歉这件事对他来说意义重大。他能这样直截了当地说出来，一定是深思熟虑过的。我没想到他这么快就能下定决心这么做。”青歪了歪头。“那么，你原谅他了吗？”

"...I couldn't. It's too big. He forgave a bitchy dig at Misato. I...can't just forgive something he did that cost me my life. Not just like that."

"...我做不到。这太沉重了。他原谅了对美里的一次刻薄挖苦。我...无法就这样原谅他让我付出生命代价的行为。不会就这么简单。"

"He's got to die for you before you can forgive him? You got it back after the Impact."

他必须为你而死，你才能原谅他吗？冲击之后你又得到了它。

Asuka glared at her. "That's not the same and you know it!"

明日香瞪着她。“那根本不一样，你自己心里清楚！”

"I know, Asuka. But what can he do besides dying for you? He was ready to in that coup. His life for yours."

我知道，明日香。但他除了为你而死还能做什么呢？在那场政变中，他已做好了准备。用他的生命换取你的。

Asuka blew out her breath in a sigh. "I know! But...it's hard." She took another gulp of the bottle and looked out at the sea. "I didn't know until today that he tried to... to offer himself in my place when he thought Winthrop was forcing me into his bed. He got beaten unconscious trying to... take that hit for me. I thought he just left me one day. I hated him for the next three years for that. Now it turns out it wasn't even his fault. He was left there and kept there on Winthrop's orders. I chose to go to Winthrop, out of... 'safety'." Asuka gave a disgusted snort. "And now Daniel undid all that, and I'm a virgin all over again, but still have the guilt of 'choosing' to submit to that. So Shinji ended up paying for a sin I chose but now didn't actually commit. I don't know if I need to apologize to him for unintentionally inflicting that on him, forgive him for a failure that was my fault, or just leave it at thanking him for trying to 'defend my virtue' when even I wouldn't."

明日香叹了口气，吐出一口长气。“我知道！但是……这很难。”她又喝了一大口瓶中的酒，望向大海。“直到今天我才知道，他以为温斯洛强迫我上床时，曾试图……试图以自己代替我。他为了替我挡下那一击，被打得昏迷不醒。我以为他有一天就这样离开了我。为此，我恨了他三年。现在看来，那根本不是他的错。他是按照温斯洛的命令被留下的。我出于……‘安全’考虑，选择了去温斯洛那里。”明日香厌恶地哼了一声。“而现在，丹尼尔解开了这一切，我又成了处女，却仍背负着‘选择’屈服的罪恶感。所以，真嗣最终为我的选择买单，尽管我现在并没有真正犯下那个罪。我不知道是否需要为无意中让他承受这一切向他道歉，原谅他因我的过错而导致的失败，还是仅仅停留在感谢他试图‘捍卫我的贞操’，即使那并非他所愿。”

"So now it's just one giant ball of awkward?" Ching asked.

“所以现在就变成了一大团尴尬？”青问道。

Asuka snorted again. "Yeah, that's us. I'm trying to act more like back then, like you suggested. Sometimes it works for a while, but I keep running into things that make me remember that it's not like it was back then, and I suddenly snap back."

明日香再次哼了一声。“是啊，就是我们。我正试着像你建议的那样，表现得像以前一样。有时候能坚持一会儿，但我总是遇到一些事，让我想起现在和以前不一样了，然后我就突然回过神来。”

"Like what?" “比如什么？”

"After the Third and I got back to 'my' ship, there were hundreds of the crew in the bay to greet us. A whole crowd, cheering my name...and then I heard somebody yell 'I love you, Asuka!'" She shivered. "I... wasn't ready to hear something like that, especially not from some random person in a crowd. How sad is that? That I'm scared off by just hearing that?"

与第三号返回'我的'飞船后，船坞里有数百名船员迎接我们。一大群人，高呼我的名字……然后我听到有人大喊“我爱你，明日香！”她颤抖着说：“我……还没准备好听到这样的话，尤其不是来自人群中的某个陌生人。这多可悲啊？仅仅因为听到那句话就让我害怕。”

"They're scary words, Asuka, if they mean it. They're even more scary when it's from someone who means something to you. Then they can be really scary."

这些话很可怕，明日香，如果他们是认真的。当这些话来自对你有意义的人时，它们甚至更可怕。那时，它们真的可以非常可怕。

"Anyone ever said it to you?" Asuka asked hesitantly.

"有人这么对你说过吗？" 明日香迟疑地问道。

"Of course, but not in the way I think you mean. I've had lovers, I've had people who loved me, but I've never met that one, the one who will love me beyond all else," Ching said wistfully. "Never one who said it that way, the way we all long to hear. That's why I envy you; you're so young. You two met when you were barely even teenagers, and you're still just nineteen and twenty. I've waited centuries, and I still haven't been so lucky."

当然，但并非你所想的那种方式。我有过情人，也有人爱过我，但我从未遇到那样一个人，那个会无条件爱我的人，"青感慨地说道，"从未有人那样说过，那种我们内心渴望听到的承诺。这就是我羡慕你的原因；你还这么年轻。你们俩相遇时还只是十几岁的少年，如今也不过十九和二十岁。而我等待了数个世纪，却仍未有如此幸运。"

"Wait, what? You've waited centuries? How old are you?" Asuka asked in disbelief.

"等等，什么？你等了几个世纪？你多大了？" 明日香难以置信地问道。

"I'm 432 years old. I'll be 433 in five months," Ching said matter-of-factly.

"我 432 岁了，再过五个月就 433 岁。" 青实事求是地说道。

"Bit...wha...guh?" "啥...呃...啊？"

"That's kind of unusual for your world?" Ching asked, somewhat confused.

"在你的世界里，这种情况算是挺不寻常的吧？" 青有些困惑地问道。

Asuka finally got control of her tongue again. "Gec...Yes! Yes it fucking is! Nobody lives that long! I thought you were supposed to be 'closer in age' to me!"

明日香终于再次控制住了自己的舌头。“该死……是的！没错，就是这样！没人能活那么久！我以为你应该和我‘年龄相仿’才对！”

"I am! How old do you think the Emperor is?"

我是！你觉得皇帝多大年纪了？

Asuka began a reply, and then stopped herself. "Do I even want to know?"

明日香开始回答，然后又停了下来。“我甚至想知道吗？”

"If my being a mere four thirty two freaked you out, probably not!"

如果我只是个四点三十二就让你吓到了，那倒未必！

Asuka pressed the cool bottle against her forehead. "Against him being a god-emperor, this shouldn't surprise me as much, but go ahead; how old is he?"

明日香将冰凉的瓶子贴在额头上，“面对他那神皇的身份，我本不该如此惊讶，但说吧，他多大了？”

Ching looked at her for a second, then shrugged. "Okay, you asked for it. He's soooo old, he...just kidding. His 452,000th birthday celebration was when I was ah... forty four. The Empress is slightly younger, thanks to the time they were separated during the years before the Founding. Ten or twenty thousand years or so, I think."

青看了她一眼，然后耸了耸肩。“好吧，你问的。他太老了，他……开玩笑的。他 45 万岁生日庆典时，我大概是……四十四岁。女皇稍微年轻一些，多亏了建国前那些年他们分开的时间。我想大概十万年或者二十万年左右吧。”

Asuka stared at her, eyes wide as they could go. "Gott's little fish in trousers..."

明日香瞪大眼睛盯着她，"穿着裤子的上帝小鱼……"

"So, then what happened?" Ching asked briskly.

"那么，后来发生了什么？"青问得干脆利落。

"What? Happened when?" Asuka's brain was still refusing to process that number. He was 452,388 years old?! Stone tools weren't that old! Fire wasn't that old!

"什么？什么时候发生的？"明日香的大脑仍然拒绝接受那个数字。他竟然已经 452,388 岁？！石器时代都没那么古老！火的使用也没那么久远！

"When he apologized, and you couldn't forgive him, what did he say?"

当他道歉时，你无法原谅他，他说了什么？

Asuka just blinked at her.

明日香只是朝她眨了眨眼。

Ching sighed. "Look, if I just let you sit here, you're going to sprain your brain trying to wrap your head around the idea that His Majesty is older than your head can handle. So let's just lay that aside, and get back to the merely impossible business of getting you and Shinji to talk to each other like normal people, hmm? What did he say when you told him you couldn't forgive him? You did tell him that, right?"

青叹了口气。“听着，如果我让你坐在这儿，你只会绞尽脑汁也无法接受陛下比你想象的还要年长这一事实。所以我们先把这个放一边，回到仅仅是难以置信的任务上来——让你和真嗣像正常人一样交流，嗯？你告诉他你无法原谅他时，他怎么说的？你确实告诉他了吧？”

Asuka shook her head and tried to reset herself. "Uh, yes, I did. I told him I couldn't forgive him, not yet. And then he said 'I can't abandon you like that again, Asuka. So I won't. Ever.'" Asuka met Ching's eyes. "What do I say to that? He meant it. No one's ever..."

明日香摇了摇头，试图调整自己的情绪。“呃，是的，我说了。我告诉他我还不能原谅他，现在还不行。然后他说‘我再也不会那样抛弃你了，明日香。永远不会。’”明日香迎上了青的目光。“面对这样的话，我该怎么回应？他是认真的。从来没有人……”

Ching bit her lip. "Okay, I'm torn here. I've got one thing I want to say as 'snarky girlfriend', and one as 'doctor and sympathetic girlfriend'."

青咬了咬嘴唇。“好吧，我纠结了。我心里有一句话想以‘刻薄女友’的身份说，还有一句想以‘医生兼体贴女友’的身份说。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Go for it."

明日香翻了个白眼。“去吧。”

"Well, 'snark' says what you should say to that is 'Oh, Shinji, my dawling, take me into your scrawny arms and show me you lurrrrve me!'" Ching said, trying not to grin.

“嗯，‘尖酸刻薄’会告诉你对此应该回答：‘哦，真嗣，我的宝贝，把我拥入你那瘦弱的双臂中，向我展示你的爱意吧！’”青说这话时，努力不让自己笑出来。

Asuka bounced her now empty plastic drink bottle off Ching's head. "Very funny," she said darkly.

明日香将空塑料饮料瓶弹到 Ching 的头上，阴沉地说：“真有趣。”

Ching's expression shifted to a much more serious look. "And 'doctor and sympathetic' says 'If he meant it, you should accept it.'"

青的表情变得严肃起来。“而‘医生和同情’说，‘如果他是认真的，你应该接受。’”

"...I did. I asked him if he really meant it, if he swore that he had my back from now on, no matter what. He swore."

“...我确实问了。我问他是真的这么想吗，他是否发誓从今往后无论发生什么都会支持我。他发誓了。”

Ching sat back a bit. "Wow. He really did it. And he meant it? Wow. You're...pretty lucky, Asuka. People here hope most of their lives for an oath of devotion like that."

青往后靠了靠。“哇。他真的做到了。而且他是认真的？哇。你……真是挺幸运的，明日香。这里的人们大多一生都在期盼着这样的忠诚誓言。”

"Lucky. Right." Asuka said disgustedly. "He's an idiot and a spineless wimp. I'm a repulsive bitch and a whore. We're perfect. When I told him I couldn't forgive him just like that for something that cost my life, he just agreed with me, and said he didn't even feel like I should until he 'made it right'. Gott! It's like trying to punch a cloud of smoke, sometimes, trying to hate him...He'll do something stupidly decent like that...And then he'll do something to remind me of all the other things he's done, and it's so easy again to despise him."

"幸运。没错。"明日香厌恶地说道，"他是个白痴，一个没骨气的懦夫。我是个令人作呕的婊子，一个妓女。我们真是绝配。当我告诉他，我无法就这样原谅他，因为那件事毁了我的生活时，他竟然同意我的看法，还说直到他'弥补了过错'之前，他都不觉得我应该原谅他。天哪！有时候，想要恨他就像试图击打一团烟雾一样徒劳...他会做出那种愚蠢却正派的事...然后又会做出一些事来提醒我他以前的所有劣迹，让我再次轻易地鄙视他。"

"Just as hard to forgive him, eh?"

同样难以原谅他，是吧？

Asuka nodded tiredly. "Yeah. It feels like the rug's been pulled out from under me right now, though, to find out something I held against him so hard for years was something I caused." 'Through my own fears. Damn you, Third. You make me feel bad without you actually even doing a damn thing.'

明日香疲惫地点了点头。“是啊。感觉就像现在有人突然抽走了我脚下的地毯，发现自己多年来一直对他耿耿于怀的事情，竟然是我自己造成的。”“都是因为我的恐惧。该死的，第三者。你让我感到难受，而你甚至什么都没做。”

"An old fundamental of intelligence; 'It's not what you don't know that'll get you, it's what you think you know that isn't so,' as His Majesty has said. So you based a long and intense emotion on false assumption. Now that you know it was false, you have to let it go. But you're finding that difficult, since that means forgiving yourself for blaming him in the first place," Ching observed.

情报学的一个古老基本原则是：“不会让你陷入困境的，不是你不知道的东西，而是你自以为知道但实际上并非如此的东西，”正如陛下所言。因此，你基于一个错误的假设，建立了一段长久而强烈的情感。现在既然知道那是错误的，你就必须放手。但你觉得这很难，因为这意味着首先要原谅自己当初对他的责怪，”青观察道。

Asuka said nothing. 明日香一言不发。

Seeing she was not ready to continue on that topic, Ching moved on. "So was that what got you running out here like your ass was on fire, or was it something else?"

见她无意继续那个话题，青便转移了话题。“那么，是什么让你像屁股着火一样跑出来，还是另有原因？”

Asuka flushed. "Ah... something else."

明日香脸红了。“啊……还有别的事。”

Ching raised an eyebrow. "Mmm?"

青扬起一边眉毛。“嗯？”

"I took a nap after we got back. When I woke up... I was holding on to him..." Asuka said in a very small voice. 'And he called my name in his sleep,' she couldn't dare to say. She waited, and was somewhat surprised not to hear any snickers or snarky comments from Ching. She looked up at her.

我们回来后我小睡了一会儿。当我醒来时...我正抱着他..." 明日香用很小的声音说道。"他在睡梦中叫了我的名字," 她不敢说出口。她等待着，有些惊讶地发现没有听到青的窃笑或尖酸的评论。她抬头看向她。

Ching was watching her, an intent but calm expression on her face. "That didn't send you running out here in a gi. What happened next?"

青凝视着她，脸上带着专注而平静的表情。“那并没有让你穿着道服跑出来。接下来发生了什么？”

"I... got up and talked to the priestess that's watching my mother whenever we're not there. I... kind of told her my troubles. She said it sounded like the Third was important to me, and that I should talk to him. She asked me what he was to me... and I didn't know. I don't know what he is. I... I just don't know anything. I don't even know who I am anymore."

我...起身与那位在我们不在时照看母亲的祭司交谈。我...向她倾诉了我的烦恼。她说听起来第三位对我很重要，建议我与他谈谈。她问我他对我意味着什么...我不知道。我不清楚他究竟是什么。我...我什么都不明白。我甚至不知道自己是谁了。

"I know who you are," Ching said firmly. "You are Asuka. The Great Asuka Langley Sohryu, the girl who does. Not. Give. Up. The girl who in the middle of being mind-raped still said she'd rather die than retreat. The girl who faced down an entire JSSDF brigade and nine Mass Production Evas alone, with a sneer and her mother's spirit. That's something else I saw, looking through all those records; Pinned to the ground, a fucking spear through your eye, bleeding from a dozen wounds, surrounded by foes who just wouldn't go down... you were still fighting, still swearing death on your enemies. Asuka Langley Sohryu would die before she gave up. And not even death will stop you, so it proved. It doesn't matter that your motivation may have been a desperate need to prove yourself to the whole world to justify your own existence. You grew that determination all by yourself. As long as you can fix a goal in your mind, you have the will to achieve it."

"我知道你是谁，" 青坚定地说道，"你是明日香。伟大的明日香·兰格雷·惣流，那个永不言弃的女孩。在被精神侵犯的痛苦中，你依然宁愿选择死亡也不退缩。那个独自面对整个日本自卫队旅和九台量产型 EVA，带着嘲讽和母亲的灵魂的女孩。这也是我在翻阅那些记录时看到的：被钉在地上，一根该死的矛穿透你的眼睛，身上遍布伤口，四周是不断涌来的敌人……你仍在战斗，仍在诅咒着敌人。明日香·兰格雷·惣流宁死不屈。即使死亡也无法阻止你，事实证明了这一点。无论你的动力是否源于一种绝望的渴望，想要向全世界证明自己存在的价值。你独自培养出了那份决心。只要你能明确心中的目标，你就拥有实现它的意志。"

"So why am I such a mess? If I was so great, Section 2 would never have had to drag me out of that bathtub when my synch rate flatlined. And I gave up after Jinnai made me watch that damn video of my mother being dragged away to die. I hate my life, all my friends are dead, and the boy who I don't love and doesn't want me is the best thing I've got in my life right now. That doesn't sound like I'm doing so great," Asuka bitterly retorted.

“那我为何如此狼狈？若我真的出色，第二部门就不会在我同步率骤降时，不得不将我从浴缸中拖出。而且，在看到真奈让我目睹母亲被拖走赴死的该死视频后，我就放弃了。我厌恶自己的生活，所有朋友都已离世，而那个我不爱且不想要我的男孩，却成了我此刻生活中最好的部分。这听起来，我可不像是过得很好。”明日香苦涩地反驳道。

"You got up and fought again after the bathtub, and you were better than ever before. Dead friends we can and will fix. And the boy who 'doesn't want you'? Is that the same one who can't take his eyes off you? I saw you two on the beach earlier. You were swimming around for a good couple of hours. He sat on the beach with binoculars and had his eyes glued to you the whole time," Ching said with a smile.

你从浴缸中站起来，再次战斗，比以往任何时候都更出色。逝去的朋友，我们能够并且将会修复。那个所谓的“不想要你”的男孩，是不是就是那个无法将目光从你身上移开的人？我早些时候在海滩上看到你们俩了。你在水里游了足足几个小时。他坐在海滩上，用望远镜，全程目不转睛地盯着你，"青笑着说。

"Ahem!" Asuka cleared her throat loudly and tried to cover her flush. "Anyhow, after I washed off the salt, I found him in the workout room, and challenged him to a few rounds. He was barely fighting me at all, said he 'didn't like feeling like he was going to hurt me.' I had to nearly tear his head off to get him to take the fight seriously and come at me. And he finally did. It was... pretty good. And then I... then I said something kind of... I don't know..."

"咳咳！"明日香大声清了清嗓子，试图掩饰自己的脸红。"反正，我洗掉盐分后，在健身房找到了他，向他发起了几轮挑战。他几乎没怎么认真跟我打，说他'不喜欢感觉自己会伤到我'。我差点把他脑袋拧下来，才让他认真对待这场战斗，向我发起攻击。他最终还是这么做了。那场战斗……挺不错的。然后我……然后我说了些有点……我不知道怎么说的话……"

"What? What did you say?" Ching looked at her and gave her a squint. "Wait, is this the thing that got you running out here in such a hurry? What did you say to him?"

"什么？你刚才说什么了？"青看着她，眯起了眼睛。"等等，这就是让你这么急匆匆跑出来的原因吗？你跟他说了什么？"

Asuka nodded and stared at her feet. "I said..." She took a deep breath and said it all in one rush, "'If you wanna 'love me', Third, you better be ready to push back!' And then I threw him, hard. Then, well, that's when you saw me running by."

明日香点了点头，目光紧盯着自己的脚尖。“我说……”她深吸一口气，一口气把话说完，“‘如果你想‘爱我’，第三，你最好准备好反击！’然后我就狠狠地把他摔了出去。接着，嗯，就是你看到我跑过去的时候。”

"Sweet Lady on a pogo stick, really? You actually said that to his face? While both of you were awake?"

"弹跳杆上的甜美女神，真的吗？你居然当着他的面说出来了？而且你们俩都醒着？"

Asuka nodded. "And I have no idea what the Hell I was thinking! Why did I do that?"

明日香点头道：“而且我完全不知道我当时是怎么想的！我为什么要那么做？”

"So you flirted with him, kicked his ass, and then ran away? Good Lord, you are doing the kindergarten routine. ...Okay, you are way too wound up. You're going to go sproing unless you can relax some. As your friend and doctor, I have two possible suggestions for what we should do next, and since we've got that dinner party tonight us getting completely shitfaced is out. Maybe next week, I hear Their Majesties throw epic parties. So we go with plan B: You and I go play video games until our eyes fall out, then get ready for the dinner. Sound good?"

所以你撩了他，踢了他的屁股，然后就跑了？天啊，你这是在玩幼儿园的把戏。...好吧，你太紧张了。你要是不放松点，就要绷断了。作为你的朋友兼医生，我有两个建议供我们接下来选择，既然今晚我们有晚宴，那彻底喝醉就不行了。也许下周吧，听说陛下们办的派对很壮观。所以我们选择方案 B：你和我去打电子游戏打到眼珠子掉出来，然后再准备晚宴。听起来不错吧？

Asuka stared at her like she was crazy for a minute and then shrugged. "Fuck it, why not?" She stood up. "Let's go blow up some digital bad guys."

明日香盯着她看了一会儿，仿佛她疯了似的，然后耸了耸肩。“管他呢，为什么不？”她站起身来。“走，我们去炸掉一些数字坏蛋。”

### Chapter 12 Not A Date, Just Dinner & Friends

shinji let the shower's multiple jets pound on his skull. The roar of the water against his scalp was perfect numbing white noise in his head, keeping his mind a blank slate. Blank was good. He could handle blank. He was a post-grad expert on not thinking. Long stretches of the Angel War and his lonely exile in Boston had been given over to deep sessions of not thinking at all. Not thinking was his preferred way of not dealing with a lot of deep, painful topics in the life of Shinji Ikari.

真嗣任由淋浴的多重水流猛击着他的头颅。水流撞击头皮的轰鸣声在他脑海中形成了完美的麻木白噪音，让他的思绪保持一片空白。空白是好的。他能应对空白。他是个不思考的研究生专家。天使战争的漫长时期以及在波士顿孤独流亡的日子，都被他用来进行长时间的彻底不思考。不思考是他避免处理真嗣·伊卡里生活中许多深层痛苦话题的首选方式。

He'd laid there on his back in the workout room, eyes still looking upside-down through the door to the hallway, for the better part of an hour. Asuka's last throw hadn't stunned him for even a tenth as long as her statement right before it.

他仰面躺在训练室里，眼睛透过倒置的门望向走廊，这样过了大半个小时。明日香最后那一摔甚至没让他晕眩十分之一的时间，而她摔之前的那句话却久久萦绕不去。

"If you wanna 'love me', Third, you better be ready! to! push! BACK!"

如果你想“爱我”，第三，你最好准备好！反！击！

He'd spent at least thirty minutes straight with his mind in a static loop, that energetically punctuated statement just echoing over and over in his head. "If you wanna 'love me'... Did she... did she just say... she couldn't be...

他至少花了三十分钟，脑海中一直循环着那句充满活力的断言，一遍又一遍地在耳边回响。“如果你想‘爱我’……”她……她刚才是不是说……她不能……

Was she giving him the slightest possible hint of something?

她是否在向他透露最微妙的暗示？

No way. Winged Emperors appearing in their tent, his mother's soul extracted from Eva Unit-01 in the depths of space past Mars, him getting to land a perfect punch right on his father's nose, sure, he could buy all that...

不可能。翼皇帝出现在他们的帐篷里，他母亲的灵魂从火星之外深空中的 Eva Unit-01 中被抽取出来，他竟然能一拳完美地打在他父亲的鼻子上，这些他都能接受...

But Asuka hinting that... "If you wanna 'love me'... She... she wouldn't hint like that... if... it wasn't possible. If she was actually hinting that... Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods...

但明日香暗示说……“如果你想‘爱我’……”她……她不会那样暗示……如果……不是有可能的话。如果她真的在暗示那一点……哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊……

Yeah, not thinking was much easier. He'd finally pried himself up off the floor and staggered like a punch-drunk zombie past the room where Asuka's mother lay. The priestess inside had nodded at him as he passed. He'd... kept zombie-stepping on by. He found himself eventually in the large bathroom off their bedroom, and some part of his brain not busy not thinking had gotten him undressed and into the shower. Now the water pounding on his head helped with the not-thinking, and things were fine. Just fine. Everything was fine.

是啊，不去思考容易多了。他终于从地板上挣扎起来，像一个被打得晕头转向的僵尸一样，踉跄着经过放置着明日香母亲遗体的房间。里面的女祭司在他经过时向他点头致意。他……继续像僵尸一样蹒跚前行。最终，他发现自己来到了他们卧室旁的大浴室，大脑中某个未被思考占据的部分让他脱掉衣服，走进了淋浴间。现在，水流猛烈地打在头上，有助于不去思考，一切都好。挺好的。一切都挺好的。

Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods

哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊

Ok, maybe not so fine.

好吧，也许没那么好。

Back to not thinking for a few more minutes. Everybody take five, and we'll reset for another try.

回到放空几分钟的状态。大家休息五分钟，我们再来一次尝试。

Unfortunately, at that point an unhelpful little reminder popped up in Shinji's brain that he'd gotten into the shower to wash off the sweat of the beach and the workout because he had to be clean for a dinner date, to be followed later in the evening by sleeping next to her.

不幸的是，就在那时，一个不请自来的小提醒在真嗣脑海中闪现：他之所以冲进淋浴间，是为了洗去海滩和锻炼后的汗水，因为他必须为即将到来的晚餐约会保持清洁，而晚上还要与她同床共枕。

Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods

哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊

Another urgent thought now called out from the back that it had been waiting five minutes for its request to blink to be acted on, and his eyes were starting to hurt. Ow. Okay... slowly and carefully now... Asuka... the girl who he'd been literally dreaming about for years... who had just last month flatly denied loving him when asked... who had nevertheless entered (surrendered?) into a fragile, tense, precarious 'arrangement' with him and had been sleeping next to him for the last month... had just... maybe, possibly... hinted... that she was perhaps not entirely opposed to the idea of... of...

另一个急迫的念头此刻从脑海深处呼喊，它已等待了五分钟，期待着对眨眼请求的回应，而他的眼睛开始感到疼痛。哎哟。好吧……现在要缓慢而谨慎……明日香……那个他多年来梦寐以求的女孩……就在上个月，当被问及时，她断然否认了爱他……尽管如此，她还是与他进入了一种脆弱、紧张、岌岌可危的“安排”，并在过去一个月里一直睡在他旁边……她刚刚……或许，可能……暗示了……她可能并不完全反对……那个想法……

"If you wanna 'love me'"... He didn't know whether to scream for joy, scream in panic, or just pass out. All three were doing pretty well in internal polling right now, although just plain screaming was gaining.

"如果你想'爱我'"... 他不知道是该欢呼雀跃，还是惊慌失措地尖叫，或者干脆昏过去。这三种反应在内心的民意调查中都表现不错，尽管单纯的尖叫声正在逐渐占据上风。

'Alright, alright, calm down, Ikari. You're good at calm. You spend lots of time calm. True, it's usually because you've got a pair of headphones in your ears and an SDAT player blocking out the world, but you're calm, right? Breathe, breathing is good... not going to panic...'

好了好了，冷静下来，碇。你擅长冷静。你花很多时间保持冷静。确实，通常是因为你戴着耳机，用 SDAT 播放器隔绝了世界，但你很冷静，对吧？呼吸，呼吸是好的……不要慌张……

'Almost five years since you've met, three years since you've seen her...h ow does she still instantly cut to the center like that? Thirteen little words, and she knocked you flat on your back for an hour. Thirteen little words, and she re-ignited the most terrifying flame of hope in you. One little sentence, and she strikes right to the core of you, just like her beauty does every time you look at her.'

自你们相遇已近五年，而最后一次见她已是三年前……她为何仍能如此瞬间直击你的心扉？短短十三个字，便让你瘫倒在地长达一小时。仅仅十三个字，就重新点燃了你心中最可怕的希望之火。一句简单的话，便如她的美貌每次映入眼帘时那样，直击你的灵魂深处。

'Oh Gods, please don't let me fuck this up!'

哦，天哪，千万别让我搞砸了！

"So, do you think you can help me?"

那么，你觉得你能帮我吗？

"Absolutely! This is exactly what I was talking about before! And it's only fitting after her little advantage that you get one of your own, ne?"

当然！这正是我之前所说的！既然她有了小小的优势，你也应该得到自己的一份，对吧？

He took a deep breath, and tried to calm himself. "Okay, when can we start?"

他深吸了一口气，试图让自己平静下来。“好的，我们什么时候可以开始？”

"How's 'now' grab you? I'm on bridge duty right now, but I'll have one of your semi-nephews meet you and get you set up. Ready for transport?"

"现在这个时间点怎么样？我正在执行桥楼值班，但我会让你们的一个半侄子来接你并帮你安顿好。准备好传送了吗？"

He nodded. The world went electric blue and hazy again, and he was gone.

他点了点头。世界再次变成朦胧的电光蓝，然后他便消失了。

Three hours later... 三小时后...

Asuka cautiously opened the door to their cabin and peered inside. No one was in the living room, and peek via her interface band showed only her mother and Mother Sriyana in the second bedroom, but she could hear the notes of Shinji's cello filling the house, so he was probably in the library playing again. Not nearly as somber as usual, he was oddly playing a rather upbeat tune. Asuka gently closed the door and followed the sound to the library.

明日香小心翼翼地打开舱门，向内窥视。客厅空无一人，通过界面带窥探，只见母亲和斯里雅娜母亲在第二间卧室，但耳边传来真嗣大提琴的旋律，充盈着整个屋子，他大概又在图书馆里演奏了。与往常的沉郁不同，他竟在弹奏一首颇为欢快的曲子。明日香轻轻关上门，循声前往图书馆。

Shinji was indeed playing, his eyes closed and a definite smile on his face. Asuka was momentarily stunned by the unusual sight. The Third Child and smiles usually went together about as commonly as donkeys and ice skating. She just stood and watched in fascination for several minutes. He was smiling. His face was... lit up. He looked like a whole different person. On the rare occasions where the Third was angry or serious, she could see his father's face in his, especially in his burning eyes. But now, wearing a smile, she could see his mother's much more gentle face, although she'd been rather mad at Asuka during their brief encounter in space this morning.

真嗣确实在玩耍，他闭着眼睛，脸上挂着明显的笑容。这一不寻常的景象让明日香一时愣住了。第三适格者与笑容通常就像驴子和滑冰一样罕见。她只是站着，好奇地观察了几分钟。他在微笑，他的脸庞……焕发着光彩。他看起来像是完全不同的人。在极少数真嗣生气或严肃的时刻，她能在他身上看到他父亲的影子，尤其是在他那炽热的目光中。但现在，带着微笑，她看到了他母亲更为温柔的面容，尽管今早在太空中的短暂相遇时，她对明日香颇为恼火。

Shinji reached the end of the piece and opened his eyes. He finally registered her presence at the door to the library. "Hello, Asuka. Welcome back." He looked at her more closely. "What are you smiling about?"

真嗣演奏完曲子，睁开了眼睛。他终于注意到她站在图书馆门口。“你好，明日香。欢迎回来。”他更仔细地打量着她，“你在笑什么？”

Asuka blinked. Her hand rose to touch her face. She was. She was smiling at him, from just watching his face. Quick, cover story, um..."I, uh, just had a good time hanging out with Ching. It's time to get dressed for this dinner, baka. Come on." 'Yeah, that ought to fool him, if he's blind and stupid. Damn it.' She turned and walked back to the bedroom and started rifling through the wardrobes and dressers. She found a decently stylish jacket and pants for him and tossed them behind her at the bed without looking back. "Those ought to make you look good enough to be seen with me, so get dressed."

明日香眨了眨眼，手不自觉地摸向自己的脸。她确实在笑，仅仅因为看着他的脸就露出了笑容。快，找个借口，呃……“我，嗯，只是和阿静玩得很开心。该换衣服去吃晚餐了，笨蛋。快点。”“是啊，这应该能骗过他，如果他既瞎又蠢的话。该死。”她转身走回卧室，开始翻找衣柜和抽屉。她找到一套还算时髦的夹克和裤子，头也不回地朝床上一扔。“这些应该能让你看起来配得上和我一起出现，快换上吧。”

"Mmrph," came from right behind her.

"呣呣呣," 从她身后传来。

"What?" Asuka spun around. The Third Child was right behind her, already 'wearing' the jacket and pants, though not in the usual method. Her blind toss had draped both of them right over his face and head. The coat hanger gave him rather nice antlers. Asuka barked a laugh. "Hey, looks good on you, Third. Covers up all the less pretty parts."

"什么？"明日香转过身来。第三适格者就在她身后，已经"穿上"了夹克和裤子，但并非寻常方式。她那随意一扔，恰好将两者披挂在他脸上和头上。衣架给他添了一对相当不错的鹿角。明日香忍不住笑出声来。"嘿，这身打扮挺适合你的，第三。遮住了所有不那么好看的部分。"

He clawed the clothes off his face and gave her a dirty look, but stepped back to sit on the bed and begin taking his shirt off. She threw him an undershirt and a button-up white shirt, then closed his wardrobe to begin digging for a dress for herself. She carefully selected a sleeveless yellow dress that echoed her favorite sun dress that she used to wear back during the war. It seemed fitting to evoke memories of that time, considering who they were going to see.

他用力扯开遮住脸的衣服，对她投去一个不悦的眼神，但还是退后坐到床上，开始脱下自己的衬衫。她扔给他一件打底衫和一件白色纽扣衬衫，然后关上衣柜，开始为自己翻找裙子。她精心挑选了一条无袖的黄色裙子，这条裙子让她想起了战时最喜欢穿的太阳裙。考虑到他们即将见的人，这样的回忆似乎恰如其分。

She hesitated longer over the dresser of underclothes. She dashed a look over her shoulder to confirm the Third Child wasn't watching before looking back into the drawer herself. The drawer was full of bra and panty sets from basic white cotton to very racy lace and silk items. The years she'd been kept in Winthrop's or Jinnai's beds the choice hadn't even been hers. For the last month, she'd just worn whatever, the Third would see it anyway, and it didn't matter. Now, suddenly, it did. With her little challenge cum hint at the end of their sparring, her selection of underwear had suddenly gone from mere clothing to a deliberate, chosen signal. And she had no idea what she wanted to say with that signal right now. Bland? Daring?

她在内衣抽屉前犹豫了更久。她迅速回头瞥了一眼，确认第三子没有在看，才又转头看向抽屉。抽屉里满是各式内衣套装，从基本的白色棉质到极为性感的蕾丝和丝绸款式。这些年被囚禁在温斯洛普或金奈的床上时，选择权根本不在她。过去一个月，她只是随便穿，反正第三子总会看到，也无所谓。但现在，突然之间，这变得重要了。在他们的较量结束时，她那小小的挑战兼暗示，让她的内衣选择突然从单纯的衣物变成了一个刻意选择的信号。而她此刻完全不知道自己想通过这个信号表达什么。是平淡无奇？还是大胆挑逗？

Her hand hovered over the spicy race-car-red lace bra in one corner. Did she want to hint like that? Did she want to draw his attention? Would it work? How would she react if it did? Every memory related to sex that she had was at the same time a filthy, ugly vision of coercion and violation, yet balanced now by always being rescued in the nick of time. Add in the increasingly strong effects of the medical exam resetting her neurochemistry and hormones, for the first time in years Asuka felt aware of her body in a good way, and the idea of men (and one male in particular) staring at her aroused more than just her ego. It finally belonged to her again. This time—

她的手悬停在角落里那件火辣赛车红蕾丝胸罩上方。她想这样暗示吗？想吸引他的注意吗？这招会奏效吗？如果真的奏效，她又该如何反应？她所有与性相关的记忆，同时都是一幅肮脏丑陋的强迫与侵犯画面，但如今总在千钧一发之际被救赎所平衡。再加上医疗检查不断增强的调整她神经化学物质和激素的效果，多年来，明日香第一次以一种美好的方式感受到自己的身体，而男人们（尤其是某位男性）注视她的想法，激起的不仅仅是她的自尊。她的身体终于再次属于她自己。这一次——

"Asuka?" he said from behind her. "You've been standing there staring at your underwear for five minutes. Is something wrong?"

"明日香？" 他从她身后问道，"你已经站在那儿盯着你的内衣看了五分钟了。有什么问题吗？"

She jumped. "No, of course not. I'm just picking carefully!" Her hand darted into the drawer half-blindly and grabbed at the first pair under her fingertips. She wadded it into her hands to hide it from his sight and snatched her selected dress out of the wardrobe, stalking towards the bathroom. "I'm going to be a bit getting ready in here. No peeking or you die!"

她吓了一跳。“不，当然不是。我只是挑得仔细点！”她的手半盲地伸进抽屉，随手抓起触到的第一双袜子。她将袜子揉成一团藏在手中，不让他看见，同时从衣柜里抓出选好的裙子，快步走向浴室。“我得在这儿准备一会儿。不许偷看，否则你就死定了！”

Even her fixed stare ahead as she marched into the bathroom couldn't miss the Third's smile. He'd seen her jump. Damn, he must have guessed something. She'd have to come up with some way to regain the upper hand when she emerged. Some push to keep the initiative in her hands even before they got to the dinner and his brain would go totally to pieces.

即便她昂首阔步走进浴室时那凝视前方的目光，也未能错过第三者的微笑。他肯定看到了她的惊跳。该死，他一定猜到了什么。她得想个办法，待会儿出来时重新掌握主动权。得来个先发制人，哪怕在晚餐前，也要让他的思绪彻底乱成一团。

An idea popped into her head and a small smile grew on her lips. This could be... fun.

一个念头突然闪现在她的脑海中，她的嘴角不由自主地浮现出一抹浅笑。这或许会……很有趣。

Shinji sat on the living room's couch and fidgeted. Asuka had sent him out of the bedroom so she could finish getting ready, and he'd wandered out to sit on the couch and think. A dinner date. A date. With her. This was the subject of he didn't know how many dreams both before and during Instrumentality. After, well, not so much. Exile and the fragile nature of their 'arrangement' had never allowed for anything like that. But now he was sitting in fancier clothes than he'd worn in years, waiting for her to emerge from the bathroom. Had the path of his life ever allowed for a more normal experience, he guessed this is what his prom night might have been like, right down to the sweating palms and dry throat. At least Asuka's father was probably dead and definitely in another universe, and not polishing a shotgun next to him.

真嗣坐在客厅的沙发上，坐立不安。明日香把他赶出卧室，好让她完成准备，于是他便游荡到沙发上坐下思考。一次晚餐约会。与她约会。这曾是他在融合前后的梦境中不知多少次幻想过的场景。之后，嗯，就不那么多了。流亡和他们的“安排”脆弱性从未允许过这样的事情发生。但现在，他穿着多年未穿的更考究的衣服，等待着她从浴室出来。如果他的生活轨迹曾允许过更正常的经历，他猜想这可能就是他的毕业舞会之夜的样子，从手掌出汗到喉咙发干，无一不似。至少明日香的父亲可能已经去世，肯定在另一个宇宙，而不是在他旁边擦拭着猎枪。

He heard the sound of the bedroom door opening and stood up. A faint rustle of cloth came down the hallway. Followed by an angel. Or possibly a demon, if his old school friends had been correct.

他听到卧室门打开的声音，站起身来。走廊里传来一阵轻微的布料摩擦声。随后，一个天使出现了。或者，如果他那些老同学说得没错，可能是个恶魔。

Asuka's hair had been brushed until it nearly glowed. She still wore her Eva A10 interface headset like a crown. Slight touches of make-up made her already brilliant blue eyes shine and gave her blood-red lips. A long sleeveless silk dress in the same yellow as the dress she'd worn the day they met on the Over The Rainbow hugged her every curve and highlighted most of them with delicate embroidery. And where had she found jewelry? She sparkled with diamond earrings, bracelets, and a necklace. She walked partway into the room and stopped to give him a raised eyebrow, fists on her hips.

明日香的秀发被打理得几乎闪耀着光芒，她依旧戴着 Eva A10 接口耳机，宛如一顶王冠。淡淡的妆容让本就明亮的蓝眼睛更加闪耀，也为她那血红色的双唇增添了色彩。一件无袖的黄色丝绸长裙紧贴着她的每一寸曲线，这件裙子与他们在“彩虹之上”相遇那天她所穿的款式相同，精致的刺绣更是突出了她的身姿。至于珠宝，她是从哪里寻得的呢？钻石耳环、手镯和项链让她整个人熠熠生辉。她缓缓步入房间，停下脚步，挑起一边眉毛，双手叉腰，向他投去挑衅的目光。

"I thought you were supposed to stand up when a lady enters the room, Third, not sit down?"

我以为女士进屋时你应该站起来，老三，而不是坐下？

"Huh?" Shinji looked down. Yup, he was sitting down again. When had that happened? His legs had quit on him and he hadn't even noticed the fall. "Um, I'm sorry."

"嗯？" 真嗣低头一看，果然，他又坐下了。这是什么时候的事？他的腿已经不听使唤，连摔倒都没察觉到。"呃，对不起。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "We travel to another world, hopscotch all over space and time, raise the dead, rocket around in the hottest mecha in the universe, and still all you say is 'I'm sorry.' I despair of improving you, Third. Am I going have to throw you in the lagoon like I said earlier?"

明日香翻了个白眼。“我们穿梭到另一个世界，在时空里跳房子，让死者复活，驾驶着宇宙中最酷炫的机甲四处飞驰，而你却只会说‘对不起’。我对你改进的希望都破灭了，第三。难道真要像我之前说的那样，把你扔进泻湖里吗？”

Shinji stood up and made sure his knees didn't forget what they were supposed to be doing this time. "I'm..." 'Stop right there, idiot. Try again.' "Ah, You look really nice, Asuka." 'Well, that's better than "I'm sorry", I guess.'

真嗣站起身来，确保这次膝盖不会忘记它们该做的事情。“我……”‘停，笨蛋，重新说。’“啊，你看起来真的很漂亮，明日香。”‘嗯，这比说“对不起”好多了，我想。’

Asuka's doubtlessly sarcastic reply was interrupted by a knocking at the door. Shinji walked over and opened it. Ching gave a little half-bow and smiled hello to the both of them. Her usual Imperial Navy black uniform was tonight topped by a plain black peaked cap that a chauffeur might wear. "Good evening, friends. You both look ready for a fine meal with old companions. May I offer you a ride?"

明日香的回答无疑带着讽刺，却被敲门声打断。真嗣走过去开了门，青微微鞠了一躬，向他们俩微笑问好。她平日里穿的帝国海军黑色制服今晚配了一顶朴素的黑色尖顶帽，像是司机常戴的那种。“晚上好，朋友们。你们俩看起来已经准备好和老朋友共进美餐了。需要我载你们一程吗？”

"A ride?" Shinji asked. He looked behind Ching when she turned to gesture at the perfectly ordinary looking limousine sitting on the beach beside the house. It was even a Mercedes-Benz. Shinji blinked. The multiple moons and the three Niven rings threw off more than enough light to see by, and there were distinctly no tire tracks behind the car. "How did you get that here?"

"坐车？" 真嗣问道。当晴转过身来指着停在房子旁边的海滩上那辆外观普通的豪华轿车时，他朝她身后望去。那甚至是一辆梅赛德斯-奔驰。真嗣眨了眨眼。多个月亮和三个尼文环提供了足够的光线，可以清楚地看到，车后明显没有轮胎痕迹。"你是怎么把这车弄到这儿来的？"

"I drove it, of course," Ching said. "How else?"

"当然是我开的，" 青说，"不然呢？"

"Stop asking silly questions, Third. You're going to make us late." Asuka grabbed his hand and pulled him along as she brushed past him. "Come on."

"别问傻问题了，三号。你会让我们迟到的。" 明日香抓住他的手，一边从他身边擦过一边拉着他走。"快点。"

Ching held the door open for them to climb into the back of the limousine. Daniel and Rayana were already inside waiting for them.

青为他们扶着车门，让他们爬进豪华轿车的后座。丹尼尔和拉雅娜已经在里面等着他们了。

"'Allo, sailor! Y'goin' my way then?" Rayana greeted them.

"喂，水手！你是往我这个方向去吗？" 雷亚娜向他们打招呼道。

"Duuuuuuudes! Howza hangin'? Bitchin' righteous party comin', amiright?" Daniel added. "Wanna brewski?"

伙计们！最近咋样？超正点的派对要来了，我说得没错吧？" 丹尼尔补充道，"想来瓶啤酒吗？"

Shinji stared at them in complete confusion. He turned to Asuka and asked, "That was English, wasn't it?"

真嗣一脸茫然地盯着他们。他转向明日香问道：“那是英语，对吧？”

Asuka was giving Daniel and Rayana's cheerful grins a similarly confused look. "I... don't know? It sure wasn't German."

明日香同样困惑地看着丹尼尔和蕾安娜的欢快笑容，说道：“我……不知道？肯定不是德语。”

Daniel just laughed. "Just messing with you a little, dude and dudette. I grew up talking this way. Rayana... well, she's just nuts. Royalist hussy!"

丹尼尔只是笑了笑。“开个小玩笑，兄弟姐妹们。我从小就是这么说话的。至于雷亚娜……嗯，她就是个疯子。保皇派的轻佻女子！”

His wife bopped him on the head. "Coconuts, thank you! Hush your Colonial foolishness! God save the Queen!"

他的妻子在他头上轻拍了一下，“椰子，谢谢你！别再说那些殖民地的蠢话了！上帝保佑女王！”

"You are both crazy," Asuka said.

"你们俩都疯了，"明日香说道。

"Nope... well, yes, but in this case, we are both very thoroughly off duty," Rayana said. "No interruptions tonight, we get to have a few hours of peace having dinner with friends." She banged on the partition to the driver's compartment. "Oi! Let's get this floating circus underway, me hearties! Vamanos and stuff!"

"不...嗯，是的，但这次我们俩都彻底下班了，" 雷亚娜说。"今晚不会有任何打扰，我们可以享受几个小时与朋友共进晚餐的宁静。" 她敲了敲与驾驶舱隔开的隔板。"喂！让这个漂浮的马戏团动起来吧，伙计们！出发吧，还有其他什么的！"

A muffled "Aye aye, Your Majesty," came back from up front, and the limousine started rolling. Then the horizon dropped away and back, and they were airborne.

前方传来一声低沉的“遵命，陛下，”随即轿车开始缓缓前行。紧接着，地平线向后退去，他们腾空而起。

Part 22 第 22 章

Dinner With Friends 与朋友共进晚餐

A short flight later the limousine settled down on a broad green lawn beside a building with wide windows permitting a good view to the large table set up inside. No one was at the table as yet, no anywhere inside, as far as Shinji could see. Asuka allowed him to take her hand assisting her out of the vehicle, but quickly pulled it out of his grasp once they were both out. Daniel had already offered Rayana his arm and they were calmly walking to the door of the building. Ching closed the door and aimed the key fob at the limousine. She pushed a button, and with a double chirp the car shimmered like a dissolving mirage and vanished.

短暂的飞行后，豪华轿车降落在一片宽阔的绿草坪旁，旁边是一座有着宽大窗户的建筑，透过窗户可以清晰地看到里面摆放着一张大桌子。然而，桌子周围以及室内似乎空无一人，至少真嗣没有看到任何人。明日香允许他牵着她的手帮助她下车，但一旦两人都出来后，她便迅速抽回了自己的手。与此同时，丹尼尔已经向蕾雅娜伸出了手臂，两人平静地向建筑的大门走去。青关上车门，用钥匙扣对准轿车，按下一个按钮，随着两声鸣叫，车子如同消散的海市蜃楼般闪烁着消失了。

"I bet that makes parking easy," Asuka commented. She grabbed Shinji's arm. "Come on, Third Child. We've got an entrance to make."

"我打赌这停车肯定方便，"明日香评论道。她抓住真嗣的胳膊，"走吧，第三适格者，我们得去亮相了。"

Ching brought up the rear as they walked inside, tossing her cap onto the hat rack beside the door. "Drinks, Your Majesties?" she said, moving towards the bar.

青走在后面，进门时顺手把帽子扔到门旁的帽架上。“陛下们，要喝点什么吗？”她说着，朝吧台走去。

Daniel waved her down. "Stand down, Lieutenant. You're relieved of duties for the evening too. You're here as a friend of our guests, not on the clock. Imperial Residence staff will be handling the serving duties for tonight." As if summoned by his words, the door to the kitchen swung open and a white coated bartender came in. "Good evening, Yutha'rik! My usual, if you please."

丹尼尔向她挥手示意。“中尉，你也退下吧。今晚你也被免除了职责。你是作为我们客人的朋友来这里的，不是在工作时间。皇家居所的工作人员将负责今晚的服务工作。”仿佛被他的话召唤一般，厨房的门打开了，一位身着白色外套的调酒师走了进来。“晚上好，尤塔瑞克！请给我来杯常喝的。”

Shinji tried not to stare at the new arrival. He was black. Not dark brown like an African, but actually jet black with yellow cat-eyes and leathery, plated skin. His face had a pronounced snout. His answering smile and nod at Daniel's order revealed a flash of many sharp, pointed teeth before he turned to pick up a bottle off the shelf above the bar. "Anyone else have anything they'd like?" he growled pleasantly, his voice like a rock tumbler full of sand and stones. His tall, mobile ears twisted back to keep in their direction as he turned.

真嗣尽量不去盯着新来的那位。他肤色漆黑，不是非洲人那种深棕色，而是真正的乌黑，黄色的猫眼，皮肤像皮革般有鳞片状纹理。他的脸有着明显的长鼻。在丹尼尔的命令下，他微笑点头回应，露出一排锋利尖牙，随即转身从吧台上方的架子取下一瓶酒。“还有谁想要点什么吗？”他愉快地咆哮着，声音如同装满沙石的滚筒。他那高耸灵活的耳朵随着转身而转动，始终保持朝向。

An agonizingly familiar voice called out from behind Shinji, "I'll have an ice cold Yebi—SHINJI! ASUKA!"

一个令人痛苦地熟悉的声音从真嗣身后传来：“我要一杯冰镇的 Yebi——真嗣！明日香！”

Shinji found himself tackled hard from behind by someone who began trying to squeeze the life out of him. Or possibly suffocate him; he was spun around long enough for the attacker to renew the attack-hug from his front, and he was saved from marshmallow Hell only by the few inches he'd grown since he'd last been grabbed by someone this endowed.

真嗣突然被人从背后猛烈扑倒，对方开始试图勒紧他的生命。或者说可能是想让他窒息；他被旋转得足够久，以至于攻击者得以从前方重新发起拥抱攻击，而他仅凭自上次被如此丰满之人抓住后长高的几英寸，才得以从棉花糖地狱中幸免。

He finally managed to pull back far enough to get a better look at his attacker. Long purple hair framed sparkling brown eyes. Eyes he'd last seen as she pushed him into an elevator during that last, disastrous battle in the Geofront. "Mi...MISATO-SAN!" He pulled her into the hug this time, squeezing back as fiercely as she'd gotten him. "You're alive! How?!"

他终于设法后退到足够远，以便更清楚地观察袭击者。长长的紫色头发映衬着闪烁的棕色眼睛。那双眼睛，他最后一次见到是在那场灾难性的最终战役中，她将他推进了第三新东京市地下的电梯里。“美……美里小姐！”这次他主动将她拥入怀中，像她之前紧紧抓住他那样用力回抱。“你还活着！怎么可能？！”

"My, my, I know you like her, Shinji-kun, but you're going to have to let her go eventually. I saw her first," said another ghost's voice behind Misato. Shinji's tightly squeezed shut eyes popped open to see the perpetually stubbled chin and roguish grin of Ryoji Kaji in the doorway. "And yesterday I called 'dibs' on her. Or maybe it was she on me. Ah, Asuka-chan, been a while, ne? OOF!"

哎呀，我知道你喜欢她，真嗣君，但总有一天你得放手。我可是先看上她的，"另一个幽灵般的声音在美里身后响起。真嗣紧闭的双眼猛地睁开，只见门口站着的是永远带着胡茬的下巴和那副不羁笑容的加持良治。"昨天我还先声夺人了呢。或者说是她先看上我的。啊，明日香，好久不见了，对吧？哎哟！"

Asuka tackled her former guardian as hard as Misato had hit him. Her rapid fire squeals of happy greeting in German quickly passed any intelligibility to Shinji, or Otto von Bismarck for that matter.

明日香以与美里同样猛烈的势头扑向她曾经的监护人。她那连珠炮似的德语欢快问候声，迅速超越了真嗣或俾斯麦所能理解的范围。

"'Though they go mad within Instrumentality, they shall be sane, Though they sink through the sea of LCL, they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost, love shall not; And death shall have no dominion'," Daniel paraphrased. "Not in my realm. I told you we'd try to give everything back, Shinji. We'd hardly forget the closest you had to family in your life. Good evening, Major Katsuragi, Inspector Kaji. You're right on time." It still took several minutes for Shinji to halt his tears and let go of his surrogate mother. She didn't fight him very much; she was crying just as hard. But she did let go after a few minutes to pull a somewhat less enthusiastic Asuka away from Kaji and give her a just as tight embrace. Asuka looked not as happy with it as her glomp of Kaji had been, but unbent enough to hug Misato back eventually, if briefly. Shinji hesitated, torn between a bow, a handshake, and a hug when Kaji just gave him a backslapping hug.

"'尽管他们在人类补完计划中陷入疯狂，他们将保持理智；尽管他们沉入 LCL 之海，他们将再次升起；尽管爱人可能失去，爱却不会消逝；死亡将不再有主宰'," 丹尼尔引述道，"在我的领域里并非如此。我告诉过你，我们会尽力归还一切，真嗣。我们绝不会忘记你生命中最近的家人。晚上好，葛城少校，加持巡查官。你们来得正是时候。" 真嗣花了好几分钟才止住泪水，松开了他的代理母亲。她并没有过多抗拒；她自己也哭得厉害。但几分钟后，她还是松开了手，把略显不情愿的明日香从加持身边拉开，给了她一个同样紧实的拥抱。明日香对此并不如之前对加持的拥抱那般高兴，但最终还是软化了，短暂地回抱了美里。真嗣犹豫着，在鞠躬、握手和拥抱之间徘徊，而加持则直接给了他一个拍背的拥抱。

"It's good to see you too, Shinji-kun. You've gotten taller," he said with a smile.

“真高兴见到你，真嗣君，你长高了，”他微笑着说。

"Kaji-san! Y...you just disappeared one day, and left that message! What happened?" Shinji said plaintively.

"加濑先生！你...你有一天突然消失了，只留下那条消息！发生了什么事？" 真嗣哀怨地说道。

"I got a little too close to things SEELE and your father wanted hidden. My rescuing Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki from SEELE's kidnapping was the last straw. Seems I got someone mad. Our hosts told Katsuragi and I that you and Asuka-chan had a rough time of it since I saw you last. Sorry to have worried you all like that." He nodded his head at Asuka and Misato. "Are you and Asuka together, finally? I always thought you would go well together. You two were as bad as Katsuragi and I."

我过于接近了 SEELE 和你父亲想要隐藏的事情。从 SEELE 手中救出副司令冬月是我最后的过激行为。看来我惹恼了某人。我们的东道主告诉我和葛城，自从我上次见到你们后，你和明日香经历了不少困难。很抱歉让你们担心了。" 他向明日香和美里点头致意。"你和明日香终于在一起了吗？我一直觉得你们会很般配。你们俩就像我和葛城一样。"

Shinji looked down at his shoes. "It's...not like that. We're just..." ''Together'? Are we honestly even 'Friends'? I don't know what we are to each other. We're certainly not 'lovers', that's for sure.' "We have an arrangement, but it's not like you two," he said, eyes downcast.

碇真嗣低头看着自己的鞋子。“这……并不是那样。我们只是……”“在一起”？我们真的算是“朋友”吗？我不知道我们彼此之间算什么。我们肯定不是“恋人”，这点可以确定。”“我们有个约定，但和你们俩不一样，”他说着，目光低垂。

"Oh ho? And you don't look very happy about it, either. You'll need to tell me more when we have a chance, Shinji-kun."

哦嚯？看来你对此也并不开心。有机会的话，真嗣君，你得跟我多说说。

The group filtered to seats around the only set table, a long straight one. Daniel and Rayana took the head and foot, Ching at Daniel's immediate right, and the other couples the center of the sides, leaving three empty seats. Before they actually sat, Shinji looked the question at Daniel, who nodded his head at the door behind Shinji. Shinji turned in time to see his mother enter, alone.

众人陆续落座于唯一的长桌旁，这是一张笔直的长桌。丹尼尔和拉雅娜分别坐在首尾，青坐在丹尼尔的右手边，其他夫妇则坐在两侧中央，留下三个空位。在他们真正坐下之前，真嗣向丹尼尔投去询问的目光，丹尼尔朝真嗣身后的门点头示意。真嗣及时转身，看到他的母亲独自走了进来。

Shinji ran to her embrace. "Hello, Shinji," she said into his hair as she hugged him.

真嗣跑向她的怀抱。“你好，真嗣，”她拥抱着他，轻声说道。

"Father?" he asked quietly.

"爸爸？" 他轻声问道。

Yui's face tightened. "Your father will not be joining us tonight. I am not very pleased with him. Some of the things he did to you and your sister..." She shook her head. "It's almost unforgivable."

结城的面容紧绷起来。“你父亲今晚不会来。我对他很不满意。他对你和你妹妹所做的一些事情……”她摇了摇头，“几乎不可原谅。”

Shinji had to run that statement over in his head a few times to be sure that he'd heard it right. "Sister? What sister?"

碇真嗣不得不在脑海中反复回想那句话，以确保自己没有听错。“妹妹？什么妹妹？”

His mother looked even sadder. "Ayanami Rei. She was...created by your father and Dr. Akagi out of some of my DNA, mixed with Lilith's. She was half me, half Angel. She had the soul of Lilith within her, but she was your half-sister by blood, Shinji. And your father...had her created just to use her as a tool to trigger the Third Impact on his own terms. He let her die twice to advance his plans, and was ready to do it again at the end." Yui looked at Shinji with a sad smile. "But she rejected him, and chose to give the choice of humanity's fate to you, my son. Because you were a better person, the only one to show her compassion and treat her like more than a tool. I'm proud of you, Shinji."

他的母亲看起来更加悲伤了。“绫波丽。她是由你的父亲和赤木博士用我的部分 DNA 与莉莉丝的混合创造出来的。她一半是我，一半是天使。她的体内拥有莉莉丝的灵魂，但从血缘上讲，她是你的同父异母妹妹，真嗣。而你的父亲……创造她只是为了利用她按照自己的意愿引发第三次冲击。他为了推进自己的计划，让她死了两次，并在最后时刻准备再次牺牲她。”唯带着悲伤的微笑看着真嗣。“但她拒绝了他，选择将人类的命运交给你，我的儿子。因为你是一个更好的人，是唯一一个向她展示同情，把她当作人而非工具对待的人。我为你感到骄傲，真嗣。”

Shinji's head swam. Rei was his...half-sister? Created by father? And had an Angel's soul? He knew something like that last part had to be true, after the mind-bending sights he'd experienced in the Third Impact and how intimately Rei had been a part of that, but that she was his sister as well? 'Wow... I didn't think it was possible for me to hate father even more than I already did, but look at that, mother just found me a way.'

真嗣感到头晕目眩。绫波是他的……同父异母的妹妹？由父亲创造？还拥有天使的灵魂？他知道最后那部分一定是真的，经历了第三次冲击中那些令人心智扭曲的景象，以及绫波在其中扮演的亲密角色，但没想到她还是自己的妹妹？'哇……我本以为自己对父亲的恨意已经无法再加深了，但看看这个，母亲刚刚为我找到了一个理由。'

He distantly felt his mother take him by the shoulders and guide him back to the table. He snapped out of his spinning thoughts to take his seat. Asuka gave him a questioning look, but he just stared at his plate. His mother sat down to his right. She continued, "There's too much he did to you to forgive without repentance. Things he did to you, your sister, and you too, Sohryu-san." Yui's eyes flicked to Asuka. "In trying to 'protect' me from any possibility of contact with an Angel, he forced you to face the 15th Angel by yourself, and would not allow Shinji and I to even attempt a rescue of you. He forced you to sortie against the 16th when you were in no shape to do anything at all. I...I apologize for thinking so badly of you this morning when you hit him. You were more than justified." Yui bowed her head to Asuka.

他隐约感觉到母亲抓住他的肩膀，引导他回到桌前。他从纷乱的思绪中回过神来，坐回座位。明日香投来询问的目光，但他只是盯着盘子。母亲坐在他的右边，继续说道：“他对你所做的一切，没有悔改就无法原谅。那些事，对你，对你的妹妹，还有你，惣流小姐。”绫波的目光转向了明日香。“为了‘保护’我，不让我有任何接触使徒的可能，他迫使你独自面对第 15 使徒，甚至不允许真嗣和我尝试营救你。当你状态不佳时，他又强迫你出击对抗第 16 使徒。我……我为今早你打他时我对你有如此糟糕的看法而道歉。你完全有理由这么做。”绫波向明日香低头致歉。

Asuka looked rather nonplussed. "I don't feel any guilt for what I did, Dr. Ikari. He deserves far worse. " She blinked. "Wait, what sister?" She turned to Shinji. "You have a sister?"

明日香看起来相当困惑。“我对我所做的事并不感到内疚，碇博士。他应得的远不止这些。”她眨了眨眼。“等等，什么姐姐？”她转向真嗣。“你有姐姐？”

Shinji looked bleakly into her eyes. "Ayanami."

真嗣黯然地凝视着她的眼睛。“绫波。”

"What?!" Asuka and Misato burst out in stereo. Kaji raised his eyebrows.

"什么?!" 明日香和美里异口同声地喊道。加持挑起了眉毛。

Yui explained Rei's origins for the three still in the dark.

结衣向仍蒙在鼓里的三人解释了绫的来历。

Misato was the first to recover. "Oh God, Shinji, I'm so sorry... we never knew. All those clones in Terminal Dogma... there must have been dozens... scores..."

美里第一个回过神来。“哦，天哪，真嗣，我真的很抱歉……我们完全不知道。特遣教条区里的那些克隆体……肯定有几十个……甚至更多……”

Asuka seemed in shock, just staring at Yui. "Your sister..." she whispered repeatedly.

明日香似乎惊呆了，只是盯着唯看。“你的妹妹……”她一遍遍地低声重复着。

Misato watched Rayana finishing a large glass of something with a vile green color. "Yutha'rik! Another 'Alien Secretion' or I'm not going to be able to stop myself from smiting someone's dad," she called.

碇真嗣注视着绫波丽喝完一大杯颜色恶心的绿色液体。“尤塔瑞克！再来一杯‘外星分泌物’，否则我可控制不住要揍某人的老爸了，”她喊道。

Shinji didn't notice any of it. His clenched fist on the table was shaking. Yui laid her hand on it and he raised his head.

真嗣并未察觉到这一切。他紧握的拳头放在桌上，微微颤抖。绫波轻轻地将手放在他的拳头上，他这才抬起头来。

"Which is why I have told him that my forgiving him is contingent on you. I can't forgive him if he can't win the forgiveness of those he wronged the most; you and Rei. Until he convinces you, I won't."

这就是为什么我告诉他，我对他的宽恕取决于你。如果他无法赢得那些他伤害最深的人——你和零的原谅，我就不能原谅他。在他说服你之前，我不会这么做。

"Forgive him?!" Shinji exploded. "He threw me away for over ten years like I was garbage! He only brought me back because I was 'useful to him'! He made me fight or he'd have forced Rei to when she could barely get out of a hospital bed! He made me nearly kill my friend! He forced Asuka into a fight when she could barely synch as bait! And when she was being violated by the 15th Angel, he wouldn't let me save her! He made me sit there and listen while she screamed!" His voice rose to a yell by the end. Facing his mother, he missed Asuka's flinch. "He can go to Hell!"

"原谅他？！" 真嗣爆发了，"他把我像垃圾一样抛弃了十多年！只有当我对他有用时，他才把我带回来！他逼我战斗，否则就会强迫连医院床都下不了的绫波去战斗！他让我差点杀死我的朋友！他强迫同步率极低的明日香去当诱饵！当第十五使徒侵犯她时，他甚至不允许我去救她！他让我坐在那里，听着她的尖叫声！" 到最后，他的声音变成了怒吼。面对着母亲，他没有注意到明日香的颤抖。"他可以去地狱了！"

"Be careful what you wish for around here, Shinji. If that's what you want, I can make it happen. I maintain and operate my own Hell, for those truly unworthy or unwilling to seek penance and redemption. And I know of even worse places than that." Daniel's quiet interruption snapped Shinji's head around. "My wife thinks I am a fool sometimes, because I choose to believe that everyone can be redeemed. There are days that choice is hard to maintain, but I must believe it. I fight until the day we all rise up. All of us. Nobody falls. So please, give him at least the chance of convincing you to forgive him."

在这儿，真嗣，小心你的愿望。如果那是你想要的，我可以让它成真。我维持并操控着自己的地狱，专为那些真正不配或不愿寻求忏悔与救赎之人。而且我知道还有比那更糟的地方。"丹尼尔平静的插话让真嗣猛地转过头来。"我妻子有时认为我是个傻瓜，因为我选择相信每个人都能得到救赎。有些日子，这个信念难以坚守，但我必须相信。我会战斗到我们所有人崛起的那一天。我们所有人。没有人坠落。所以，请至少给他一个说服你原谅他的机会。"

"That's not to say you can't make him work for it," Rayana added.

“这并不是说你不能让他为此努力，”雷亚娜补充道。

Shinji's look of murderous fury faded a notch, but not far. "One of the few fucking times I got over my own stupid funks and was ready and trying to help Asuka and he stopped me? Do you know how many times I've had to hear her screaming in my sleep? I've got too many of my own sins to win forgiveness for. I don't need his. Forgive him? Not until Asuka does first."

真嗣那充满杀意的怒容稍稍缓和了一些，但并未消散多少。“难得我克服了自己的愚蠢情绪，准备并试图帮助明日香，他却阻止了我？你知道我有多少次在睡梦中听到她的尖叫吗？我自己的罪孽已经太多，无法得到宽恕。我不需要他的。原谅他？除非明日香先原谅他。”

Shinji's uncharacteristic outburst startled the rest of the table. Asuka was surprised enough at the usually pathologically quiet Third Child actually angry and swearing that she at first missed his final statement. "Wait, me?"

真嗣这反常的爆发让桌边的其他人吃了一惊。明日香对平时病态沉默的第三适格者竟然发怒并咒骂感到足够惊讶，以至于一开始没听清他最后的话。“等等，我？”

Shinji nodded. "He wants my forgiveness? He can start with you. I've got more than enough things I need to gain my own forgiveness for from you. He can damn well get in line. Or he can go to Hell, I don't care."

真嗣点了点头。“他想要我的原谅？那就从你开始吧。我需要从你这里得到自我宽恕的事情多得是。他大可以排队等着，或者他可以去地狱，我不在乎。”

Asuka seemed unsure of how to respond to this. She opened and closed her mouth several times without ever getting a sound out. She stared at Shinji's face with an odd look before shaking her head to clear whatever she'd been thinking. "Why don't you ask for something easy, like reversing the Third Impact, Third?" she said with faint amusement.

明日香似乎不知道该如何回应。她张了几次嘴，却始终没能发出声音。她用一种奇怪的眼神盯着真嗣的脸，然后摇了摇头，仿佛要驱散脑海中的思绪。“你怎么不要求些简单的事，比如逆转第三次冲击呢，第三？”她带着一丝淡淡的戏谑说道。

"Eh, we can and can't do that Asuka, sorry," Rayana said. To everyone else's look of surprise she shrugged and continued, "You all remember it happening. If we actually totally undid it or prevented it, it would force your worldline to preclude your current existence. We can undo as many of the effects as you like, but we're not going to do something that would unmake yourselves. We've prevented the Third Impact in other worldlines, but you are the product of one where it did happen, and we have to work from there. Don't worry, there's not a lot of the effects we can't fix or mitigate in at least some way."

"呃，明日香，我们能做也做不到，抱歉。"雷亚娜说。面对众人惊讶的表情，她耸了耸肩继续道："你们都记得那件事的发生。如果我们完全撤销或阻止它，将会迫使你们的世界线排除你们当前的存在。我们可以消除尽可能多的影响，但我们不会做任何可能抹去你们自身的事情。我们在其他世界线阻止了第三次冲击，但你们是发生过那次冲击的世界线的产物，我们必须从那里开始。别担心，没有太多我们无法修复或至少以某种方式缓解的影响。"

"In any case, forgiveness for Gendo is not likely to happen tonight, so I think we'll go ahead with dinner," Daniel said. "Order anything you want, there's a whole kitchen staff standing by to have it made as you like, and a quick time loop to have it here as soon as your order hits the kitchen."

无论如何，今晚对源堂的宽恕似乎不太可能发生，所以我想我们还是继续安排晚餐吧，"丹尼尔说。"你想吃什么就点什么，整个厨房团队随时待命，按照你的喜好制作，而且还有快速时间循环，确保你的订单一到达厨房，食物就能立刻送到这里。

Dinner orders took just a few moments. The former GEHRIN and NERV members were all digesting the pre-dinner revelations and declarations well before the food could arrive. Even the offered delight of Black Forest Cake for dessert hardly got a reaction from Asuka. Shinji kept looking at her as they ate, but the redhead was remarkably quiet. He looked at Kaji and Misato, but they mostly were looking at each other with goofy smiles. Rayana spotted his stares and reached across one of the empty places to poke Kaji in the arm. His questioning look in return got just a significant glance at his hand from the Empress.

晚餐点单仅用了片刻时间。前 GEHRIN 和 NERV 成员们早在食物送达之前，就已经消化了餐前的启示与宣言。即便是作为甜点提供的黑森林蛋糕，也几乎未能引起明日香的反应。进餐时，真嗣不断看向她，但这位红发少女异常沉默。他又望向加持和美里，他们大多时候只是彼此对视，脸上挂着傻笑。蕾雅娜察觉到真嗣的目光，便从空位那边伸手轻戳了加持一下。加持疑惑地回望，只得到皇后意味深长的一瞥。

He brightened considerably after a moment's thought. "Oh! Ah...heh. Shinji-kun, Asuka-chan, Dr. Ikari, we'd like you to be the first to hear; Misato-chan agreed to marry me last night. After she had finished hitting me over the head for having the stupidity to get killed on her before, of course."

他沉思片刻后，脸上顿时明朗起来。“哦！啊...呵。真嗣君，明日香酱，碇博士，我们希望你们第一个知道；昨晚，在米萨托酱因为之前我愚蠢到在她面前死去而打了我一顿之后，她同意嫁给我了。”

"Congratulations, Kaji-san! You finally let him catch you, Misato-san!" Shinji said, smiling. His mother offered polite congratulations as well. Noticing her silence, Shinji looked at Asuka, who was looking at the newly engaged couple with a sad smile that slowly changed to a sharper one.

“恭喜你，加持先生！你终于让他抓住你了，美里小姐！”真嗣笑着说。他的母亲也礼貌地表示了祝贺。注意到她的沉默，真嗣看向明日香，她正带着悲伤的微笑注视着这对新订婚的情侣，那微笑渐渐变得更为尖锐。

"Congratulations to both of you," Asuka finally said. "It's not a surprise to me, Third. Daniel showed me this afternoon," she said to his stare. She looked at Misato. "Right about the time he was chasing you out the door of your cabin, both of you holding beers of course."

"恭喜你们两位，"明日香终于开口说道，"对我来说并不意外，第三适格者。丹尼尔今天下午已经给我看过了，"她回应着他的目光。她转向美里，"就在他追着你跑出你宿舍门口的时候，你们俩当然都拿着啤酒。"

"I hope you left before I blindfolded him! It took him a while to find his beer after that!" Misato laughed. "It's good to see you two again. It's pretty strange for me. To my eyes, it looks like you two got four years older overnight!"

“希望你在我给他蒙上眼睛之前就离开了！那之后他花了好一会儿才找到他的啤酒！” 美里笑着说，“再次见到你们俩真好。对我来说挺奇怪的，在我眼里，你们俩好像一夜之间就长大了四岁！”

"You didn't miss anything you'd want to see," Asuka said a little bitterly. "They weren't the best years. Warlords, near starvation, meltdowns, chaos, everything that was still left to go wrong in a fucked-up world did."

"你没错过任何你想看的，"明日香有些苦涩地说，"那不是最好的年头。军阀割据，濒临饥荒，核事故，混乱不堪，在这个糟糕透顶的世界里，所有可能出错的事都发生了。"

"Yeah, our hosts gave us a brief overview of things in general and a few things about you two; mostly that you both had a key role in getting rid of that dictator by the pair of you Piloting a leftover MP Eva. Bet you were glad for all that synch training I put you through, ne?" Misato said with amusement.

是啊，我们的东道主给我们大致介绍了情况，还有关于你们俩的一些事情；主要是你们俩在驾驶那台废弃的 MP 版 EVA 联手除掉那个独裁者中扮演了关键角色。想必你们很庆幸我之前让你们进行的同步训练吧，对吧？" 三佐带着戏谑的口吻说道。

"That's all they told you?" Shinji asked. He looked at Daniel, who nodded.

"他们就告诉你这些？" 真嗣问道。他看向丹尼尔，后者点了点头。

"It's your lives. I wanted to give you the option of telling as much or as little as you cared to. I'm sure you had your fill of overexposure during Instrumentality," he said.

这是你们的人生。我想给你们选择，想说多少就说多少，只要你们愿意。我相信在人类补完计划期间，你们已经受够了过度曝光。

"Um, thank you,' Shinji mumbled. 'Yeah, and there's plenty I'm just as happy that Kaji-san and Misato-san not see from that,' he thought, picturing a particular hospital scene with mortification.

"呃，谢谢你，" 真嗣喃喃道。"是啊，还有很多事情我宁愿葛城小姐和加持先生没看到，" 他想着，脑海中浮现出医院里那令人尴尬的一幕。

"I thought I saw you during... all that?" Asuka said.

“我以为在……那一切中看到了你？”明日香说道。

Misato tilted her head. "I remember...parts of it, but it's mostly really blurry. I was bleeding out in the corridor near the R-20 elevator I'd shoved Shinji into, and I saw Rei-chan standing over me. Then it all gets...weird. The next thing I can remember clearly is I was underwater in some waves on a beach. I stood up, and Daniel was standing on the shore a few meters away with a towel, waiting for me. And this baka was standing right next to him, staring at me like I'd just fallen out of the sky! According to what Daniel told me, that's apparently what happened; he...pulled me out of the...'Ring of Souls'?" She looked to Daniel for confirmation. He nodded and she continued, "After I beat this dummy's head for a while, Daniel brought us here and let us have a day to ourselves. I let him grovel apologies for a while, and then graciously accepted his request to be my husband. He promised he'd say what he failed to eight years ago, and I let him."

惣流微微侧头，“我记得……部分片段，但大部分都很模糊。我在 R-20 电梯附近将真嗣推进去后，自己却血流不止，然后看到零站在我上方。接着一切变得……诡异起来。我能清晰记得的下一个场景是，我在一片海浪中的水下。我站起来，发现丹尼尔站在几米外的岸边，手里拿着毛巾等我。而这个笨蛋就站在他旁边，盯着我看，好像我是从天而降似的！据丹尼尔所说，那似乎就是发生的事情；他……把我从……‘灵魂之环’中拉了出来？”她向丹尼尔求证，他点头后她继续道，“在我对这个傻瓜的脑袋进行了一番敲打后，丹尼尔带我们来到这里，给了我们一天的私人时间。我让他好好道歉了一番，然后大度地接受了他的求婚。他承诺会说出八年前未能说出口的话，我便允许了。”

"I see," Asuka replied. "Well, since I saw you two this morning, I had time to do some shopping for 'engagement presents', which I obtained by great travel , difficulty, and danger."

"我明白了，"明日香回答道，"既然今早见到了你们俩，我就有时间去买了些'订婚礼物'，这些礼物可是我历经长途跋涉、重重困难和危险才得到的。"

Daniel snorted. Asuka waved in his direction. "Yes, yes, you helped a bit too," she allowed. "But I did the heroic rescue of the present for Misato!"

丹尼尔哼了一声。明日香朝他挥了挥手。“是是，你也帮了点忙，”她承认道，“但拯救礼物的英雄行为可是为了美里哦！”

"Heroic rescue of a present?" Kaji asked. "How do you rescue a present?"

"英雄救美式的救援？" 卡吉问道，"你怎么救一个礼物？"

"By getting there before the blast wave with a bit of time travel and picking up the present right after he sealed the escape pod," Daniel said.

通过一点时间旅行，在冲击波到来之前到达那里，并在他密封逃生舱后立即捡起礼物，"丹尼尔说。

"Huh?" Misato asked. "You mean like my—" A large hand fell on her right shoulder and she turned her head to look at the man now standing behind her. "—daddy?"

"嗯？" 葛城问道，"你是说像我的——" 一只大手落在她的右肩上，她转过头去看向此刻站在她身后的男人。"——爸爸？"

"Hello, Misato. You've grown up," said Dr. Hideaki Kasturagi. "Are you goin—" He got no further before Misato launched herself out of the chair and hugged him even tighter than she'd grabbed Shinji.

"你好，美里。你长大了，" 日裔博士日高英机说道，"你这是要去——" 他话还没说完，美里就从椅子上跳起来，比抱住真嗣时还要用力地紧紧抱住了他。

"Is...is that..." Kaji tried to ask after he managed to close his hanging jaw.

"这...这是..." 在好不容易合上自己张大的嘴巴后，卡吉试图问道。

"Her dad, yes." Asuka said with a grin. "I grabbed him from the Antarctic camp right before the blast from the First Angel hit. Daniel said he couldn't be the one to do it, so I did."

"她爸爸，没错。" 明日香笑着说，"我在第一使徒攻击前的爆炸中，从南极营地把他救了出来。丹尼尔说他不能这么做，所以我就去了。"

Daniel nodded. "Too many potential problems if I was that close to an entity as powerful as ADAM even for the miniscule fraction of non-time it would have taken for the pick-up. So I stayed on the far side of the portal and let Asuka do the actual snatch. We dropped him off at the clinic for healing this morning, and let him get briefed on the idea that he's been dead to the rest of the world for the last twenty years, as well as what his daughter had been up to in that time."

丹尼尔点了点头。“如果我离像 ADAM 这样强大的实体太近，哪怕只是为了那短暂到几乎不存在的瞬间去执行拾取任务，也存在太多潜在问题。所以我留在传送门的远端，让明日香去实际执行抓捕。今早我们把他送到诊所进行治疗，并让他了解到自己对世界其他部分而言已死去二十年，以及他的女儿在这段时间里的所作所为。”

Asuka was smiling, but Shinji noticed that it was edged with some sadness. 'Guess she still feels for Kaji-san, even if Misato-san has him and isn't letting go,' Shinji thought. 'I'm glad to see him alive, though. She did not like it or me very much when I tried to tell her he was gone. Hell, I'm glad to see him too. He was more of a father to me than my own ever was.'

明日香虽然在笑，但真嗣察觉到那笑容中夹杂着一丝哀愁。'看来她对加持先生还是念念不忘，即使美里小姐已经拥有了他，并且不愿放手，'真嗣心想。'尽管如此，看到他活着，我还是感到高兴。当初我试图告诉她加持先生已经不在时，她既不喜欢这个消息，也不太喜欢我。说实在的，我也很高兴能再见到他。他对我来说，比我的亲生父亲更像一个父亲。'

Asuka's smile brightened as she shifted her gaze from the nearly sobbing Major to her other former guardian. "You didn't think I'd forget you, my dear Kaji-san? I got something for you too." She pointed at the teenage boy coming in through the far door of the building.

明日香的笑容更加灿烂，她将目光从几乎要哭出来的少校移向了另一位曾经的监护人。“你不会以为我忘了你吧，亲爱的加持先生？我也有东西要给你。”她指向了从远处门口进来的那个少年。

Kaji's jaw dropped again. "...Kenji?" He stood up slowly. Misato and her father turned to see the newcomer. "Who's that, Kaji?" she asked.

薰的下巴再次惊得掉下来。“……健二？”他缓缓站起身。美里和她父亲转头看向新来者。“那是谁，薰？”她问道。

The new arrival looked like a much younger Kaji. He'd stopped a few paces back from the table and looked at him in uncertainty. "Ryoji? Big bro? Is... is that you?"

新来者看起来比加治年轻许多。他在离桌子几步远的地方停下，不确定地看着他。“绫司？大哥？是……是你吗？”

Kaji closed the gap and wrapped shaking hands around the younger man. "Kenji... you're alive..." He suddenly pulled back to arm's length and looked him in the face. "What about the rest of the guys?!"

加治迅速靠近，用颤抖的双手环抱住年轻人。“健二……你还活着……”他突然拉开距离，直视对方的脸。“其他人呢？！”

The younger man pointed up and behind him. "They're back on Second Chance, all of us. They're trying to explain where we are and get us used to the idea of what just happened. What happened to you, big bro? You're... old! You almost look like dad!"

年轻人指了指身后上方，说道：“我们又回到了‘第二次机会’上，所有人都在。他们正试图解释我们在哪里，让我们适应刚刚发生的事情。大哥，你这是怎么了？你……变老了！你看起来几乎像爸爸了！”

"I'm so sorry, Kenji, I'm sorry. I... couldn't... they caught me, they made me tell them where you guys were..." Kaji's voice started to break down.

"真的很抱歉，健二，对不起。我……没能……他们抓住了我，逼我说出了你们的下落……" 薰的声音开始崩溃。

Shinji looked at Asuka. "Asuka, what... who is that? Kaji-san's brother?"

真嗣看着明日香。“明日香，那是谁？是加持先生的兄弟吗？”

Asuka kept looking at her former guardian, her sad smile back. Still, she seemed to welcome the excuse to look away after a moment. "Yeah, that's his 'little brother' Kenji. He and Kaji-san were part of a gang of kids in Japan after the Second Impact. He was trying to steal some food from a JSSDF base and got caught. The soldiers tortured him until he gave up the location of the rest of the gang. They went and killed them all, but Kaji-san got away. He felt guilty the rest of his life for breaking like that. Daniel and I dropped in right before the JSSDF guys arrived, evacuated the whole gang, and left a bunch of fake puppet-things to take their place. The JSSDF shot up all the fakes, and Kaji-san's past is the way he remembers, but we saved his brother and their friends. That's the 'shopping' I got to do this morning, Third; Misato's father from ground zero of Second Impact, and Kaji's brother and friends from the Impact Wars." She looked at Daniel. "I think I'm starting to get why you do this. This does feel good. Giving back what he lost, I mean."

明日香一直凝视着她曾经的监护人，那抹悲伤的微笑再次浮现。不过，她似乎很快就找到了借口移开视线。“嗯，那是他的‘弟弟’健二。他和加持先生在第二次冲击后的日本，曾是街头一帮孩子的成员。他试图从日本自卫队基地偷食物时被抓。士兵们折磨他直到他说出了其他同伙的位置。他们去把那些人都杀了，但加持先生逃脱了。他余生都为那一刻的崩溃感到内疚。丹尼尔和我恰好在自卫队到达前赶到，把整个团伙都撤离了，并留下一堆假人偶来替代他们。自卫队把所有假人都打烂了，加持先生的过去就这样被记住了，但我们救了他的弟弟和朋友们。这就是我今早‘购物’的内容，第三；来自第二次冲击原爆点的葛城父亲，以及来自冲击战争的加持的弟弟和朋友。”她看向丹尼尔，“我开始明白你为什么做这些了。这感觉真好。我是说，归还他所失去的。”

Daniel gave her a slow nod. "Like I said, 'welcome to my world', Asuka." He looked at the still crying Kaji brothers. Misato was holding on to her fiancé's back and trying to comfort him. "Now he just has to get used to the idea can let go of that guilt, and that he's now 14 more years older than his 'little' brother. The rest of their gang is up on Second Chance, one of Avalon's moons. As the name hints, they're mainly involved in rescuing people who die or were about to die from whatever 'verse they come from and integrating them into new lives. They're coming straight from the middle of the Impact Wars, so they've got a little adjusting to do, even if they just go right back to your world in the end."

丹尼尔缓缓地点了点头，“就像我说的，‘欢迎来到我的世界’，明日香。”他望向仍在哭泣的加持兄弟。美里紧抓着未婚夫的背，试图安慰他。“现在他只需要适应这个想法，放下那份罪恶感，意识到自己比‘小’弟弟大了 14 岁。他们那伙人现在在阿瓦隆的一颗名为‘第二次机会’的卫星上。正如其名，他们主要负责救助那些来自各个‘宇宙’中死去或即将死去的人，并帮助他们融入新生活。他们直接从冲击战争中来，所以即使最终直接回到你的世界，也需要一些时间来适应。”

He took another bite of his Dodo Alfredo. "In any case, once they get over the shock, we'll have a nice dinner with old friends and family, and an overall pleasant evening. I know your day has been somewhat stressful, Dr. Ikari, but at least it's a day not spent in an Evangelion Unit slowly drifting in the vague direction of Antares. Things can only get better." He looked at Shinji and Asuka. "I hope you two have had a good day at least. You've even got a new toy, Asuka. And I hear you got a comm call from the daughter of your analogue. How did that go?"

他再次咬了一口自己的渡渡鸟阿尔弗雷多意面。“无论如何，一旦他们从震惊中恢复过来，我们将与老朋友和家人共进一顿愉快的晚餐，度过一个总体上令人愉快的夜晚。我知道你今天有些压力，碇博士，但至少这不是在初号机中缓慢漂向心宿二方向的一天。事情只会变得更好。”他看向真嗣和明日香。“我希望你们俩至少今天过得不错。明日香，你甚至得到了一个新玩具。我听说你还接到了你模拟对象女儿的通讯。那通电话怎么样？”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "I learned the supposed daughter of another universe's 'me' is almost as annoying as the Third Child on a mope, just in the opposite direction. And it's even harder to picture her as a 'daughter' when she had to be at least twice my age."

明日香翻了个白眼。“我得知另一个宇宙中‘我’的所谓女儿，几乎和第三适格者情绪低落时一样烦人，只是方向相反。而且，当她年纪至少是我的两倍时，更难以想象她会是‘女儿’。”

"Senior Fleet Commander Sohryu-Ikari is a good deal more than that, yes. I think we'll leave the specifics out," Rayana commented. "Ready to sit and have a meal with your family, Mister and Misses-Kaji-to-be?"

“是的，远不止如此，高级舰队指挥官苏龙-伊卡里。我想我们还是不谈具体细节了，”雷亚娜评论道。“准备好和你的家人一起坐下来用餐了吗，未来的卡吉先生和夫人？”

Misato managed a tearful smile and a nod. Kaji seemed to still be in a bit more shock, but gathered his younger brother with him to the table. The table became much more animated, Kaji and Misato's joy at the return of their once-lost family members drawing in the others. Dr. Katsuragi was amazed to hear what had happened to his old research companion, Dr. Ikari, after the Second Impact. Somewhat to his own surprise, Shinji found himself enjoying the meal, surrounded by family for the first time in years. So much so that he missed the thoughtful looks his mother occasionally shot towards him and Asuka.

美里勉强挤出一个含泪的微笑并点了点头。加持似乎仍有些震惊，但还是带着他的弟弟一起坐到了桌旁。餐桌上的气氛顿时活跃起来，加持和美里因失而复得的家人归来而流露出的喜悦感染了其他人。葛城博士听到他的老研究伙伴碇博士在第二次冲击后的遭遇，感到非常惊讶。令他自己也有些意外的是，真嗣发现自己很享受这顿饭，这是多年来他第一次被家人环绕。以至于他错过了母亲偶尔投向他和明日香那深思的目光。

A tap on his shoulder after dinner had dwindled to drinks and conversation brought Shinji out of his quiet enjoyment of the more talkative table members' chatter. He looked over his shoulder to see Daniel motioning him to follow. He rose from his chair, missing Asuka's curious look. He followed Daniel out the door facing the shore. Daniel was waiting just above the high tide line on the beach.

晚餐后，当酒水与交谈逐渐减少时，有人轻拍了下真嗣的肩膀，将他从静静享受那些健谈桌友闲聊的愉悦中拉了出来。他回头一看，见丹尼尔示意他跟随。他起身离开椅子，错过了明日香好奇的目光。他跟随丹尼尔走出门，来到面朝海岸的地方。丹尼尔正站在海滩上，恰好高于涨潮线。

"Sorry to draw you away, Shinji, but there's something I wanted to mention that we didn't really have a good opportunity for before. Something about Asuka I think is important for you to know about and keep in mind over the next few days," he said.

“抱歉把你叫过来，真嗣，但有件事我想提一下，之前我们一直没有合适的机会。是关于明日香的事，我觉得对你来说很重要，接下来的几天里你要记在心上，”他说道。

Shinji felt slightly apprehensive at that kind of potentially ominous preface. "Um, okay. Like what?"

真嗣对这种可能带有不祥预兆的开场白感到有些忐忑。“呃，好吧。比如说？”

"You know Asuka is frankly, a genius, yes? College graduate in mathematics at thirteen, spoke multiple languages by the same time, and so on?"

你知道明日香其实是个天才，对吧？十三岁就大学毕业，专业是数学，同时还会说多种语言，诸如此类

Shinji nodded. "Yes. It's kind of scary sometimes when I hit reminders of how smart she is."

真嗣点头道：“是的。有时候我突然意识到她有多聪明，感觉挺吓人的。”

"Indeed, that kind of thing can be a little intimidating. But there's a flip side to it that you need to keep in mind; in some ways Asuka assumes everyone else is as smart as she is. That's why she gets mad at you and others sometimes. She unconsciously assumes everyone else is at her level, and she gets upset when you fail to correspondingly interact with her because she thinks that means you're being deliberately dense. She's sometimes surprisingly upset, even if she doesn't show it, when people are oblivious to references and hints she makes," Daniel explained. "For example, do you remember the first night you two were alone together in Misato's apartment, in the middle of your synch training?"

确实，那种事情可能会让人有些胆怯。但你需要记住，这其中也有另一面：在某些方面，明日香会默认其他人跟她一样聪明。这就是为什么她有时会对你们发火。她无意识地认为每个人都与她水平相当，当你未能相应地与她互动时，她会感到沮丧，因为她认为这意味着你在故意装傻。即使她没有表现出来，当人们对她所做的暗示和提及无动于衷时，她有时会感到出乎意料的沮丧。"丹尼尔解释道，"比如，你还记得你们俩第一次单独在美里公寓的那晚，当时你们正在进行同步训练吗？

Shinji looked away at the horizon, embarrassed. "Ah, yes, I do." That hadn't been one of his prouder nights. Asuka had sleepwalked onto his futon, and bedazzled by her curves and face in the moonlight, he'd almost kissed her in her sleep...and stopped cold when he saw she was crying in her sleep and whimpering for her Mama. He'd spent the rest of the night sleeping on the other side of the room from her under a blanket, trying not to listen to her soft, pitiful cries.

碇真嗣尴尬地望向地平线，回答道：“啊，是的，我确实有过。”那并不是他值得骄傲的一晚。明日香梦游到了他的蒲团上，月光下她曼妙的身姿和面容让他几乎在她熟睡时吻了她……但当他看到她在睡梦中哭泣，呜咽着呼唤妈妈时，他猛地停住了。那晚剩下的时间里，他睡在房间的另一边，裹着毯子，尽量不去听她那轻柔而可怜的哭泣声。

"I'm not talking about you nearly kissing her, Shinji." Shinji flushed even more at the reminder that some of the most embarrassing moments of his life were known to too many people here. "I'm talking about earlier. Do you remember what she said?"

"我不是说你差点吻她那件事，真嗣。" 真嗣听到这话，脸更红了，意识到自己人生中最尴尬的时刻之一竟被这里太多人知晓。"我是说之前，你还记得她说了什么吗？"

Shinji could recall that night all too well. "'If I took one step into her room, I was a dead man.' And then she almost sleepwalks on top of me!"

真嗣对那个夜晚记忆犹新。“如果我踏进她的房间一步，我就死定了。”然后她几乎梦游般地压在了我身上！

"Your sensei missed a key part of you education that might have helped you there. Being Japanese, I'm assuming you picked up a little Buddhism and Shinto, but not much more than a cursory awareness of other religions?" Daniel asked.

你的老师在你教育中遗漏了一个关键部分，那或许能帮到你。作为日本人，我猜你接触过一些佛教和神道教，但对其他宗教的了解恐怕只是略知皮毛吧？丹尼尔问道。

"Yeah, Sensei really didn't go into religion much at all. Why?"

是的，老师确实没怎么谈及宗教。怎么了？

Daniel had a half-smile. "If he'd had you study the Christian Bible, you might be a happier guy today. Asuka grew up in a predominantly Christian country. I don't think she's very religious herself, but she most definitely would have a pretty good knowledge base on the Bible. The 'Walls of Jericho' thing she said right before the 'you're a dead man' line was a Biblical reference."

丹尼尔脸上挂着半笑。“如果他让你研究过基督教圣经，你今天或许会更快乐些。明日香在一个以基督教为主的国家长大。我不认为她自己非常虔诚，但她对圣经肯定有相当不错的了解。她在你被威胁'你死定了'之前提到的'耶利哥城墙'是圣经中的典故。”

"So? I didn't need to know the story, I got the idea anyhow. Impenetrable walls, don't come in or I'm dead. It wasn't exactly subtle. And then she almost steps on me. If I'd sleepwalked into her room, she'd have ripped my head off."

所以呢？我并不需要了解整个故事，反正我已经明白了。坚不可摧的墙壁，别进来，否则我就没命了。这并不算太隐晦。然后她差点踩到我。如果我梦游进了她的房间，她肯定会把我的头拧下来。

"On the contrary; it was not a blunt warning to stay away, it was actually a subtle hint and a come on," Daniel said with some amusement.

“恰恰相反；这并非直白的警告让人远离，实际上是一个微妙的暗示和邀请，”丹尼尔带着几分戏谑地说道。

"What?" Shinji looked at him like he'd suddenly revealed Rei was a closet heavy metal fan.

"什么？" 真嗣看着他，仿佛他突然揭露了绫波是个隐藏的重金属乐迷一样。

"Shinji, the 'impenetrable' Walls of Jericho were anything but. The 'Walls of Jericho' appear in the Book of Joshua, and are chiefly notable for how easily the walls simply collapsed all at once at the sound of the Hebrew army's trumpets, after which Jericho was completely conquered by the invaders. She wasn't telling you to stay out, Shinji. She was somewhat subtly asking you to come in."

真嗣，所谓的“坚不可摧”的耶利哥城墙其实名不副实。《约书亚记》中提及的“耶利哥城墙”，最引人注目的是它们在希伯来军队的号角声中轻易地同时倒塌，随后耶利哥城便被入侵者完全征服。她并非让你止步门外，真嗣。她是在以一种微妙的方式邀请你进入。

Shinji stared at him in silent shock for a long time. "...no. No way."

真嗣盯着他，长时间沉默地震惊着。“...不。不可能。”

"She didn't know you were almost completely ignorant of the Bible. I do know she was pretty upset when you didn't even try anything. From her point of view, she made a rather up front offer, you coldly ignored it, and rejected her. She was crushed. She'd risked her heart putting the offer out there and gotten flatly shut down."

她不知道你对圣经几乎一无所知。我确实知道，当你甚至没有尝试时，她非常沮丧。从她的角度来看，她提出了一个相当直接的提议，你却冷漠地忽视了它，并拒绝了她。她心碎了。她冒着心碎的风险提出了那个提议，却遭到了彻底的拒绝。

"I...I didn't reject anything! I didn't know!" Shinji cried. "I thought she was telling me to stay out! She always was talking about how all boys were perverts! I thought that was just more of the same! How could I have known?"

“我……我没有拒绝任何事！我不知道！” 真嗣哭喊道，“我以为她是在让我走开！她总是说所有男生都是变态！我以为那只是同样的话！我怎么可能知道？”

"Just keep that sort of thing in mind going forward, Shinji. She assumes you and everyone else catch all her references. I think she might still be doing it, to some extent. For example, what piece did she ask you to play for her just before I arrived?"

今后要记住这类事情，真嗣。她以为你和所有人都能理解她所有的暗示。我觉得她现在在某种程度上还是这样。比如，在我来之前，她让你为她演奏了哪首曲子？

"Bach's Cello Suite No.1. Why?"

巴赫的大提琴组曲第一号。为什么？

"And what piece were you playing the night she demanded that kiss from you?"

"那天晚上她向你索吻时，你演奏的是哪首曲子？"

"Bach's Ce-...Oh gods." "巴赫的 C 大...哦天哪。"

"Maybe she just likes that piece. Or maybe it has good memories associated with it. If you are ever unsure about something, try asking her or finding out on your own. The house system can answer a lot of research questions, for one possible source," Daniel said calmly. "Asuka is a very smart girl, but she's also afraid of ever unmasking her heart for fear of someone getting inside. She'll rarely say directly what she means, as kind of a way she can just pretend she was 'only kidding' or 'didn't really mean it' if or when her tentative essays like that are ignored or missed. You need to step up your game if you're going to really try to play in her league. I won't tell any more of her secrets, but that's the kind of thing you're going to need to keep your eyes open for."

或许她只是喜欢那件作品，又或许它承载着美好的回忆。若你对某事存疑，不妨试着向她询问或自行探寻。房屋系统能解答许多研究问题，至少是一个可能的信息来源。”丹尼尔平静地说道，“明日香是个非常聪明的女孩，但她害怕揭开心扉，唯恐有人窥探其中。她很少直抒胸臆，仿佛这样就能在那些试探性的表达被忽视或错过时，假装自己只是‘开玩笑’或‘并非真心’。如果你想真正与她并肩作战，就必须提升自己的水平。我不会透露更多她的秘密，但你需要保持警觉，留意这类细节。”

Shinji gulped. All of a sudden 'if you wanna love me' took on even more terrifying weight than it already had. 'No pressure, Ikari. Shit, how many other 'subtle hints' did I miss back then? Or now? 'If you wanna love me...' Push back? Wait, that's what 'Commander Ikari' put in her note...Did she know? Was that something her parents had said?'

真嗣咽了口唾沫。突然间，“如果你想爱我”这句话承载的重量比之前更加令人恐惧。“别有压力，碇。该死，当时我还错过了多少其他‘微妙的暗示’？或者现在？‘如果你想爱我……’推回去？等等，这就是‘碇司令’在她的便条里写的……她知道吗？那是她父母说过的话吗？”

Daniel's large hand clapping down on his shoulder broke Shinji's train of thought. "One more thing, young lad. Useful advice in any situation: Don't Panic. Now come on, let's get back inside. Family's waiting."

丹尼尔宽大的手掌拍在真嗣肩上，打断了他的思绪。“还有一件事，小伙子。任何情况下都适用的忠告：不要慌张。现在走吧，我们回屋去，家人在等着呢。”

Shinji again frantically tried to put his head back in functioning order in light of this unbelievable new revelation. That unhelpful voice again reminded him about the sleeping next to her that would be coming at the end of the night, which put an end to all attempts at order. He dropped back into his seat at the table half-aware of what was going on...right up until Asuka's finger flicked him in the side of the head. "Ow!" He rubbed his temple and turned to face her.

真嗣再次疯狂地试图在面对这个令人难以置信的新发现时恢复理智。那个无益的声音再次提醒他，夜晚结束时将会有与她同眠的时刻，这彻底打消了他恢复秩序的所有尝试。他半知半觉地跌坐回桌边的座位上……直到明日香的指尖弹在他脑袋一侧。“哎哟！”他揉着太阳穴，转头面对她。

"I called you three times, Third. Are you in there?" Asuka said. "What was all that about? You look like you've just seen a ghost."

我给你打了三次电话，三号。你在里面吗？"明日香说道，"这都是怎么回事？你看起来像是刚见了鬼似的。

'Oh crap I really can't give you a straight answer about that right now, not without you killing me in front of my mother and everybody.' "Um...personal advice he wanted to give me. About...g—" 'Don't say 'guy stuff', she'll instantly figure out that means 'how to deal with women', which she'll know means her! 'Don't Panic', he says. Like that's easy right now! Crap crap crap...what else have we got?' An earlier bit of advice cropped up as Shinji's thoughts speedily veered towards panic. ''Be honest.' Ok, how? Ah!' "About...er ...respecting your intelligence, sort of."

哦糟糕，我现在真的没法给你一个直接的答案，不然你会在我妈和所有人面前杀了我。"呃...他想要给我一些个人建议。关于...呃..." '别说“男人之间的事”，她会立刻猜到那意味着“如何处理与女人的关系”，她肯定知道那是指她自己！'“别慌”，他说。现在哪有那么容易！糟糕糟糕糟糕...我们还有什么办法？' 之前的一些建议在真嗣的思绪飞速转向恐慌时浮现出来。'要诚实。'好吧，怎么做？啊！"关于...呃...尊重你的智慧，算是吧。"

Asuka's right eyebrow crept up in suspicion at this. "Oh?"

明日香的右眉因怀疑而微微上扬。“哦？”

'Don't Panic Don't Panic Don't Panic She can't read your mind, right? Right?' "Um...he said you're a genius, and I should keep that in mind. That I'd have to um...'step up my game' if I'm going to play in your league."

别慌别慌别慌她读不了你的心，对吧？对吧？"呃...他说你是天才，我得记住这点。就是说如果我想跟你一较高下，我得...'提升我的水平'。"

Asuka looked at him a little strangely, but seemed to accept that. "As well you should, Third. You should have figured that out a long time ago."

明日香有些奇怪地看了他一眼，但似乎接受了这一点。“你早该如此，第三。你本该很久以前就明白的。”

Shinji breathed a sigh of relief. He was safe...for now. But the end of the day loomed. And tomorrow, dealing with his father and... his sister. His fist clenched again.

真嗣松了一口气。他现在是安全的...至少目前如此。但这一天的结束即将到来。而明天，他不得不面对他的父亲和...他的妹妹。他的拳头再次紧握。

### Chapter 13 Whatever Helps You Sleep At Night


The limousine lifted away from the lawn outside the now emptied building with just Shinji and Asuka as passengers. Kaji had gone with Daniel, leaving with his brother to see his old gang and introduce them to his fiancée and father-in-law-to-be. Shinji's mother had departed with Rayana for another 'talk' with his father.

豪华轿车从已空无一人的大楼外的草坪上驶离，只载着真嗣和明日香两位乘客。加持已经和丹尼尔一起离开，去见他的老帮派成员，并介绍他们给自己的未婚妻和未来的岳父。真嗣的母亲则与蕾雅娜一同前往，与他的父亲进行另一场“谈话”。

Asuka stared out the window at the horizon without seeing anything. 'Misato wearing a ring. It must be something in the bloody water around here.' She still felt a sense of loss, but it felt less than she'd have once thought. 'I guess his being dead for a few years got me a little used to the idea he was gone. At least he's still around, now.'

明日香凝视着窗外远方的地平线，却什么也没看见。'美里戴着戒指。这里的血水肯定有问题。'她仍感到一种失落，但比她曾经想象的要轻。'我想他死了几年，我已经有点习惯他不在了。至少现在他还在。'

'He'd never want you anyway. He turned you down even before the Third Child did, remember?' The black and bitter voice argued right back. 'How is this different from any other day? Misato is much more what he wants than you. You're more of a whore than you ever accused her of being. He never looked at you like that. Just another person who doesn't want you.'

他反正也不会想要你。早在第三适格者之前，他就拒绝过你了，记得吗？那个阴暗而尖刻的声音反驳道。这和平时有什么不同？美里比你要更符合他的喜好。你比自己曾指责她的还要更像一个荡妇。他从未那样看过你。只是又一个不想要你的人罢了。

Asuka crushed the voice back with an effort of will. It was getting harder. Every good thing she was seeing just seemed to remind her of how much she wasn't. She cast about for some other topic to get her mind off her current down note. Fortunately this evening had provided plenty of other notable moments that by themselves would have fully occupied her mind on other nights.

明日香努力用意志压制住那个声音。这变得越来越难。她所看到的每一件好事似乎都在提醒她自己有多么不足。她四处寻找其他话题，以转移自己当前的低落情绪。幸运的是，这个晚上已经提供了许多其他值得注意的时刻，这些时刻在其他夜晚本就足以占据她的全部思绪。

She turned to the Third. "So Wondergirl was your half-sister?" she queried to open the topic.

她转向第三位。“那么，神奇女孩是你同父异母的妹妹？”她以此问题开启了话题。

Shinji had retreated into his more typical quiet and withdrawn state since the meal. He didn't look up at her question. "Yeah." He shifted uncomfortably in the plush seat. "I always felt a connection to her whenever I looked at her that I could never explain, even to myself. Now I know why. She reminded me of my mother one time..." He gave a tiny, bitter laugh. His fist clenched in his lap until his arm shook again and his face twisted in anger. "He knew. He knew the whole time! Rei was his daughter and he made her into spare parts! No wonder he sent her out to hand an N2 mine to the Fourteenth Angel! He had a roomful of spares in Terminal Dogma!"

饭后，真嗣又恢复了他那典型的沉默寡言、内向的状态。他没有抬头回答她的问题。“嗯。”他在柔软的座位上不安地挪动着。“每当我看着她时，总感觉有一种无法解释的联系，即使是对我自己。现在我知道为什么了。有一次，她让我想起了我的母亲……”他发出了一声微小而苦涩的笑声。他的拳头紧握在膝上，直到手臂再次颤抖，脸上露出愤怒的表情。“他知道。他一直都知道！绫波是他的女儿，他把她变成了备用零件！难怪他派她去给第十四使徒递送 N2 地雷！他在终端教条里有一屋子的备用零件！”

"She said she'd die if your father ordered it. Gott, no wonder she acted the way she did. So she was a doll after all...she was a verdammt puppet. And your father made her dance for his damn plan to end to world." Asuka said. "I always thought she was his favorite for some normal reason. It's amazing she wasn't as crazy as him."

她说如果父亲下令，她宁愿去死。上帝啊，难怪她会那样行事。原来她终究只是个玩偶……一个该死的傀儡。而你的父亲让她为他的毁灭世界计划起舞。”明日香说道，“我一直以为她之所以受宠，是因为某些正常的原因。她竟然没有他那么疯狂，真是令人惊讶。

Shinji looked up at this, but the heat in his glare wasn't aimed at her. "Rei, you, me, we were all fucking puppets to him. Touji wasn't even that! We were all pawns to advance his 'Scenario', no matter who he crushed in his way." Shinji halted as another thought stuck him. "That's why he ordered you to be the one to go into Mount Asama... you weren't Rei or Eva Unit-01. You were 'expendable'. With the 15th he wouldn't let me help you because it might risk Unit-01 and my mother. 'I don't care,' he said when I demanded to sortie. Like listening to you scream was nothing to him. Forgive him?" he spat. "Next time I see him I'm going to hit him with a gun."

真嗣抬头看着这一切，但他的怒火并非针对她。“绫波，你，我，我们都是他的傀儡。东治甚至都不算！我们都是他推进‘剧本’的棋子，无论他在路上碾碎了谁。”真嗣停顿了一下，另一个念头击中了他。“这就是为什么他命令你进入浅间山……你既不是绫波也不是零号机。你是‘可牺牲的’。第 15 次时，他不会让我去帮你，因为那可能会危及零号机和我母亲。当我要求出击时，他说‘我不在乎’。仿佛听你尖叫对他来说毫无意义。原谅他？”他唾弃道，“下次见到他，我非用枪砸他不可。”

Asuka tried to conceal her surprise at the Third Child's continuing anger. She had no love for Gendo Ikari herself, but it was unsettling to see the usually passive Third vibrating with almost patricidal fury, and for so long. "Did you mean that, during dinner? You'll tell him to go to Hell unless I forgive him first?"

明日香试图掩饰她对第三适格者持续愤怒的惊讶。她自己对源渡没有好感，但看到平时温顺的第三适格者几乎带着弑父般的愤怒颤抖，而且持续这么久，实在令人不安。“你晚餐时是认真的吗？除非我先原谅他，否则你会让他下地狱？”

Shinji's look focused in on her with alarming intensity. "I had to sit and listen to you be raped once. And then I failed you against the JSSDF and SEELE. That's why I tried to get Winthrop to take me instead. I couldn't sit and let it happen again. So if my father is ready to throw away you, me, Rei, the whole world to get mother back, then he can choke on it. Daniel and Rayana may be able to undo what happened, but we'll still remember. I'll forgive him when I don't have to hear you screaming in my sleep anymore. I'll forgive him when I get to see Rei smile again. I'll forgive him when remembering it all doesn't bother you anymore."

碇真嗣的目光以惊人的强度聚焦在她身上。“我曾不得不坐着听你被侵犯，之后我又在对抗日本自卫队和 SEELE 时让你失望。这就是为什么我试图让温思罗普带走我，而不是你。我无法再次坐视不管。所以，如果我的父亲为了找回母亲，准备牺牲你、我、绫波，乃至整个世界，那他大可自食其果。丹尼尔和雷亚娜或许能逆转所发生的一切，但我们仍将铭记于心。我会原谅他，当我在睡梦中不再听到你的尖叫；我会原谅他，当我再次看到绫波的笑容；我会原谅他，当回忆这一切不再困扰你。”

'Where was this Third Child in the War and after when I needed him?' Asuka turned her head away to look out the windows again, keeping him in sight though just the corner of her eye. She'd never had this... difficulty meeting his eyes before. "Glad to see you growing a bit of a spine, Third. You want me to hold your dad's arms when you punch him next time?"

'在我需要他的时候，这个第三适格者究竟在哪里？'明日香再次转头望向窗外，尽管只是用眼角余光，却仍让他保持在视线内。她以前从未有过这种……难以直视他眼睛的困难。“很高兴看到你终于有点骨气了，第三。下次你想揍你爸的时候，要我帮你按住他的胳膊吗？”

"Should I hold them for you? Would beating him some more bring you closer to forgiving him? All you did this morning was hit him in the head, but you seemed to like that," he said with much less fire.

"要我帮你抓住他们吗？再打他一顿会让你更愿意原谅他吗？你今早只是打了他头，但你似乎挺喜欢那样。" 他说话的火气明显小了许多。

Asuka snorted. "Probably not, but it would sure feel pretty good. We should do it just in case. Maybe several times, just to be sure."

明日香哼了一声。“可能不会，但肯定会感觉很不错。我们应该以防万一去做。也许要做几次，只是为了确保。”

His gaze lost the burning anger; this somehow unsettled Asuka even further. "I meant it, Asuka. Unless he convinces you and Rei to forgive him, I won't. He's not my father. He's just the madman my mother was married to for a while." Shinji gave another grim laugh. "'Man lives by forgetting his memories, but there are some things a man should never forget. Yui taught me about the irreplaceable things.' He told me that when we were standing at my mother's 'grave'. A grave he knew damn well was a lie, he even said so. Well I guess mother taught me too. I'm going to remember this, father. I'm going to remember everyone that was important to me that he destroyed to get what he wanted. I'll forgive when all of them are happy again."

他的目光失去了炽热的愤怒，这反倒让明日香更加不安。“我是认真的，明日香。除非他让你和绫波原谅他，否则我不会。他不是我父亲，只是我母亲曾一度嫁过的疯子。”真嗣又发出一声冷笑，“‘人靠遗忘记忆而活，但有些事人绝不该忘记。’唯教过我关于不可替代之物的事。他站在我母亲的‘墓前’时这么告诉我，那墓他心知肚明是谎言，他自己都这么说了。我想母亲也教会了我。我会记住这一切，父亲。我会记住每一个因他追求所愿而被摧毁的重要之人。我会原谅，当他们全都再次幸福时。”

Asuka still didn't know what to make of this. It was like a different person sat across from her; not the usual Third Child, a constant brooding doormat, nor the cocky hero persona she'd seen him slip into before battle, though that was closer. She'd never seen his hero attitude come out on him except right before getting into an Entry Plug. But now it had emerged right in front of her at the dinner, and mixed with more anger than almost any other time she'd seen in Shinji. Not that the target wasn't deserving, but it was still a version of Shinji she'd never seen before.

明日香仍然搞不清楚这是怎么回事。坐在她对面的仿佛是另一个人；既不是平日里那个总是忧郁的第三适格者，也不是她在战斗前见过的那种自负的英雄形象，尽管后者更接近一些。她从未见过他在进入插入栓之前展现出那种英雄态度。但现在，这种态度却在晚餐时突然在她面前显现，而且夹杂着她几乎从未在真嗣身上见过的愤怒。虽然目标确实该受此对待，但这仍然是她前所未见的真嗣的一面。

Asuka had the uncertain sensation that control of things between was slipping out of her grasp. She hated not having the initiative, the upper hand when it came to matters between her and the Third Child. Things could become... unstable if she wasn't in control. Stability was good. Instability meant surprises, and that could mean pain. She considered her options. Normally she'd push him on one of his all-too-easy to hit buttons, get him angry and off balance, and focused back on her. But she had the distinct feeling that making her initially considered crack about 'that doll' would only draw the Third's unusual anger.

明日香有种不确定的感觉，仿佛事情的掌控正从她手中滑落。她讨厌在与第三适格者的较量中失去主动权，处于下风。如果她不能掌控局面，情况可能会变得……不稳定。稳定是好的，不稳定意味着意外，而意外可能带来痛苦。她权衡着自己的选择。通常她会触碰他那些极易被激怒的痛点，让他愤怒失衡，再将焦点引回自己身上。但她明显感觉到，如果一开始就提及她曾考虑过的关于“那个玩偶”的讽刺，只会激起第三适格者异常的怒火。

'Okay, let's see where another track leads.' "Not forgiving him unless I do, swearing you've got my back no matter what, that you're never going to abandon me again; you're giving me an awful lot of power over you here, Third," she mused out loud.

好的，看看另一条轨迹会通向何方。"除非我原谅他，否则你不会原谅他，无论发生什么，你都誓言会支持我，再也不会抛弃我；你在这里给了我太多控制你的权力，Third，"她若有所思地大声说道。

"I owe you. You're right, Asuka; I wasn't there when you needed me, and you got hurt because of it. So I'm going to make it up to you. He can go to Hell. You matter more to me than he does." Shinji's stare was going out the window behind Asuka's head, aimed a thousand miles away. His right hand kept clenching and releasing.

我欠你的。你是对的，明日香；在你需要我的时候我没在，因此你受伤了。所以我要补偿你。他可以去地狱了。你对我来说比他重要得多。" 真嗣的目光越过明日香头顶，透过窗户望向千里之外。他的右手不断握紧又松开。

A sarcastic and haughty 'That's how it should be' died unsaid on her lips. How it ought to be, maybe, but almost never was between her and the Third. Before, he'd always just folded and gone where she pushed him. This was new, different. He was pushing out, going beyond his familiar boundaries. 'If you're supposed to be my 'familiar point to hold around when all is changing', Third, it doesn't help when you start changing on me too!'

她唇边未出口的讽刺与傲慢的“本该如此”悄然消逝。或许理应如此，但她与第三者之间却几乎从未如此。以往，他总是顺从地随她推动。这次不同，他开始反抗，超越了熟悉的界限。“如果你本该是我‘在万变中紧握的熟悉支点’，第三者，当你也开始变化时，这便毫无助益了！”

'I told him to 'push back'...is this what I wanted?' Asuka was acutely aware now that her hastily grabbed set of undergarments had happened to be one of the spicier ones. How would that 'signal' be interpreted tonight? They suddenly felt far too tight on her. 'This is too fast, and I don't know where we're going or who's driving. Mama, help me!' No. No, she isn't doing this. She's not going to start calling for Mama, just because she's now just a room away. She's been a strong, independent person for the last sixteen years. She was not going to break down and turn into a little girl now.

'我让他'推迟'了...这是我想要的吗？'明日香此刻敏锐地意识到，她匆忙抓起的那套内衣恰好是其中较为性感的一套。今晚这样的'信号'会被如何解读呢？它们突然让她感到异常紧绷。'这太快了，我不知道我们要去哪里，也不知道是谁在掌控。妈妈，帮帮我！'不，不，她不会这么做。她不会因为现在只隔着一个房间就开始呼唤妈妈。过去十六年里，她一直是坚强独立的个体。她现在不会崩溃，也不会变回小女孩。

As if to give the lie to her own mental argument, she found herself pressing the green dot on her interface band to see into her mother's room again. Mother Sriyana still sat beside the bed, reading her thick hardcover book by the light of a bedside lamp. Her mother still slept as she had been lying all day, hands folded across her chest. Asuka felt a little of her... nervousness subside as she looked at Mama's face. Things were going to be okay. Mama would be with her soon.

仿佛要反驳自己内心的争论，她发现自己正按下界面带上的绿色圆点，再次窥视母亲的房间。母亲斯里亚娜依旧坐在床边，借着床头灯的光线阅读那本厚重的精装书。她的母亲仍如整天那样躺着，双手交叠在胸前沉睡。看着妈妈的脸，明日香感到一丝紧张消退了。一切都会好起来的。妈妈很快就会回到她身边。

Asuka stood at the foot of the bed, trying not to bounce with anticipation. Daniel took his hand off Kyoko's forehead as her eyelids began to flutter. She sat up and looked around.

明日香站在床脚，努力抑制着因期待而想要跳跃的冲动。丹尼尔从恭子的额头上移开手，她的眼皮开始颤动。她坐起身来，环顾四周。

"Where am I? Who are all you people?" she asked.

“我在哪儿？你们都是些什么人？”她问道。

"My name is Daniel, Dr. Sohryu. You've been... ill for some time since the Contact Experiment. Your daughter has been very worried about you," their host replied.

我叫丹尼尔，碇博士。自从接触实验以来，您已经病了一段时间。您的女儿非常担心您。

"Where is my baby? Where is my Asuka?" Kyoko eagerly said.

"我的宝贝在哪里？我的明日香在哪里？" 绫急切地说道。

"I'm... I'm right here, Mama," Asuka said, tears welling in her eyes.

"我...我就在这儿，妈妈，" 明日香说道，泪水在她的眼中打转。

Kyoko Sohryu's eyes flicked over her for a moment, then dismissed her. "I don't know who that girl is. Where is my Asuka?"

京子·索拉尔的目光在她身上停留了片刻，随即移开。“我不认识那个女孩。我的明日香在哪里？”

Mother Sriyana handed her a button-eyed doll. "Here you are, Doctor."

斯里亚娜母亲递给她一个纽扣眼睛的娃娃。“给你，医生。”

"Ah, my Asuka. You never left me. You are all I need." Her mother cradled the doll tenderly in her arms and smiled at it. Then she looked up at Asuka, eyes narrowing. "Go away, girl. I don't want you staring at me. Only my Asuka gets to look at me like that. Go away!"

啊，我的明日香。你从未离开过我。你是我所需要的一切。"她的母亲温柔地将娃娃抱在怀里，对着它微笑。然后她抬头看向明日香，眼神变得锐利。"走开，女孩。我不想你盯着我看。只有我的明日香可以那样看着我。走开！"

"Ma...ma?" Asuka said in disbelief. She started shaking.

"妈...妈妈？" 明日香难以置信地说道。她开始颤抖起来。

"Go away! I don't want any filthy whores like you near me! My Asuka is pure and a good girl! Get that girl away from me! No one wants you! You're vile, worthless, useless! Away! Go away! I don't want you!"

滚开！我不想让你们这些肮脏的妓女靠近我！我的明日香纯洁又善良！把那个女孩从我身边带走！没人需要你！你卑鄙、无价值、无用！走开！滚开！我不想要你！

Asuka tried to reach out for her mother's hand as the bed began receding away from her, faster and faster. "No no no no no no Mama! Come back, come back please! PLEASE! DON'T LEAVE ME MAMA!"

明日香试图抓住母亲的手，但床开始离她越来越远，速度越来越快。“不不不不不不妈妈！回来，回来请回来！求求你！妈妈，别离开我！”

Asuka catapulted upright in the dark of their room, a frozen scream trapped in her throat by its own paralysis. It took several seconds of frantic blinking and wiping at her eyes before she could clear enough of the tears to even see where she was. It took even longer to stop them flowing down her face and to control the gasping sobs.

在房间的黑暗中，明日香猛地坐起身，一声凝固的尖叫被自身的麻痹困在喉咙里。她疯狂地眨眼、擦拭眼睛，过了好几秒才勉强擦掉足够的泪水看清自己所在。而要止住脸上的泪水，控制住急促的抽泣，则花了更长的时间。

A frantic glance at her bedmate showed him still asleep, not even the violence of her awakening shifting him from his slumber. The glow of the various moons and rings in the night sky reflected more than enough light off the sea outside to throw his features into sharp relief as he lay on his back next to her, his right arm over his head.

她急忙瞥了一眼身旁的床伴，只见他依旧沉睡，她那剧烈的醒来动作也未能将他从睡梦中惊扰。夜空中各个月亮和光环的辉映，透过窗外的大海反射出足够的光线，将他仰卧在她身旁的面容映照得轮廓分明，他的右臂横在头顶。

She carefully lay back down, flipping her cold and damp pillow over. But even several minutes of lying there in the dark could not stop her shaking, or keep away the terrifying image of her mother turning to her with contempt-filled eyes and rejecting her all over again. That had never happened before. She'd had nightmares regularly for almost as long as she could remember. This was a new wrinkle.

她小心翼翼地重新躺下，将冰冷潮湿的枕头翻了个面。然而，即便在黑暗中躺了好几分钟，她的颤抖依旧无法停止，母亲那充满蔑视的眼神再次转身拒绝她的恐怖画面挥之不去。这从未发生过。她几乎从记事起就经常做噩梦。这次却是个新情况。

"No. No. It won't happen. Mama loves me. Mama won't leave me. No. One week. I'm a good girl. Mama loves me," she tried whispering to herself, trying even harder to keep out the growing note of desperation that wanted to creep in to it. The shaking continued. She felt so cold.

"不，不会的。妈妈爱我，妈妈不会离开我。不，就一周。我是个好女孩，妈妈爱我。" 她试图低声自语，竭力阻止那股逐渐蔓延的绝望感侵入心扉。颤抖依旧，她感到彻骨的寒冷。

Her eyes traced over the Third's face. 'He's warm,' the traitorous little voice reminded her. "No," she whispered again. "I don't... I don't need..." 'That was the second time tonight! You didn't have any nightmares when you woke up there! At all!' "I... I can't... he..." 'He won't know. He didn't find out about this afternoon, did he?' Asuka bit her lip. He wouldn't know. There'd be nothing to explain. It'd be just like this afternoon. She just needed something to help her sleep. That's all.

她的目光扫过第三位的面庞。'他很温暖，'那个叛逆的小声音提醒她。"不，"她再次低语。"我...我不需要..." '今晚已经是第二次了！你在那里醒来时根本没有做噩梦！一次也没有！' "我...我不能...他..." '他不会知道的。他没发现今天下午的事，对吧？' 明日香咬着嘴唇。他不会知道的。没有什么需要解释的。就像今天下午一样。她只是需要一些帮助她入睡的东西。仅此而已。

She scooted across the gap between them, an inch at a time. Even before she fully closed the distance, she could feel the warmth coming off him. She gingerly scooted the last inch to lay up against his side. Her eyes stayed fixed on his face, ready to roll away and feign sleep at the slightest flicker of his eyelids. But even when she very, very slowly laid her head on his shoulder he did not stir.

她一点一点地挪过两人之间的空隙，每次只移动一英寸。在她完全拉近距离之前，就能感受到他散发出的温暖。她小心翼翼地挪动最后那一英寸，紧贴在他身旁。她的目光始终锁定在他的脸上，随时准备滚开并假装睡着，只要他的眼皮有丝毫颤动。然而，即便她极其缓慢地将头靠在他的肩上，他也没有任何动静。

She, however, nearly levitated to the ceiling when his right arm flopped down off the pillow to reclaim the same place it had been when she awoke this afternoon, holding her close against him behind her back. Her eyes snapped to his face, but he kept right on breathing deeply and slowly. Her heartbeat slowly came down from near-tachycardia to merely rabbit-fast. She was in. And now held in place, true, but she no longer felt cold. Quite the contrary, she now felt quite comfortably warmed.

然而，当他的右臂从枕头上滑落，重新回到她下午醒来时所在的位置，紧紧地从背后将她拥入怀中时，她几乎要飘到天花板上了。她的目光迅速转向他的脸，但他依旧深沉而缓慢地呼吸着。她的心跳也逐渐从近乎心动过速降到了只是像兔子般快速。她已经完全融入了这份温暖。现在虽然被紧紧抱住，但她不再感到寒冷。恰恰相反，她现在感到非常舒适和温暖。

'I would do anything to take your pain away.' 'I swear. No matter what.' 'You matter more to me than he does.' Asuka suppressed the echoes. She wasn't even sure who was thinking them anymore. She relaxed into the warmth and drifted towards sleep. He did smell good...

我愿做任何事来消除你的痛苦。我发誓，无论如何。你对我来说比他更重要。明日香压抑着这些回响。她甚至不确定是谁在想这些。她放松地沉浸在温暖中，渐渐向睡意靠拢。他的确闻起来很舒服...

Part 24 第 24 章

Waking Up 醒来

Shinji woke up, opened his eyes, and was then absolutely certain that he hadn't done either. He could not possibly have woken up, for several reasons. Number one, that he was still alive. Number two, this was exactly like other dreams he'd had in the past, so it must be one. Number three, it had to be a dream, since the likelihood of him actually being awake, alive, and having Asuka not just in his arms but also smiling in her sleep must have been astronomical. That he was in fact holding her tightly against him and looking at the impossibly beautiful smile on her sleeping face from a few inches away, pre-dawn light giving her a surreal pale glow, was so unlikely that he must still be asleep. Q.E.D.

真嗣醒来，睁开双眼，随即确信自己并未做到这两点。他不可能醒来，原因有几。首先，他还活着。其次，这与以往的梦境如出一辙，必定是梦。再者，这只能是梦境，因为现实中他清醒、存活，且明日香不仅在他怀中，还带着睡梦中的微笑，这种可能性微乎其微。他确实紧紧拥抱着她，从几英寸外凝视着她睡颜上那不可思议的美丽笑容，破晓前的光线为她披上一层超现实的苍白光晕，这一切太过离奇，他必定仍在梦中。证毕。

Right? 对吧？

Right. Had to be. So, since this was one of the nice dreams, he might as well enjoy it. He cuddled Asuka closer and took a deep breath of the scent of her hair. Strawberry Balsam, it never failed to make him think of her. Gods, she smelled good and felt so warm. He could feel her pressed against him all the way down his body. This was a very nice dream.

没错，一定是这样。既然这是美好的梦境，他不妨尽情享受。他更紧地拥抱着明日香，深深吸入她发间的香气——草莓凤仙花，这总让他想起她。天啊，她闻起来真香，感觉如此温暖。他能感受到她紧贴着自己的全身。这真是个美妙的梦。

It might have been due to what she had been wearing under the dinner dress. Shinji had still been too wrapped up in anger at his father about Rei to pay the attention he would have liked, but as they undressed for bed he'd still noticed her usual plain and practical brassiere and panties had been switched out for a lacy red and black set for that evening. Asuka had not met his eyes or said anything, but had somewhat unusually kept the lacy wear on as she got into bed rather than her more common stripping down fully.

或许是因为她晚餐裙下所穿的衣物。真嗣当时仍沉浸在对父亲关于绫波的怒气中，未能如愿给予关注，但当他们准备就寝更衣时，他注意到她平日里朴素实用的胸罩和内裤已被一套红黑相间的蕾丝内衣取代。明日香没有与他对视，也未发一言，而是有些反常地穿着那套蕾丝内衣上了床，而非像往常那样完全脱掉。

She'd curled up under the covers facing away from him, as usual. He'd watched her for a while. Studying her helped his simmering rage against his father slowly subside until he was relaxed enough to sleep. He'd faded out still looking at her.

她一如既往地蜷缩在被子里，背对着他。他凝视了她一会儿，研究她的身影有助于他心中对父亲的怒火慢慢平息，直到他放松到足以入睡。他就这样望着她，渐渐进入了梦乡。

And now he was back in one of his favorite dreams; holding her, just enjoying having her near him. This was even better than most; more vivid and strong than they usually were. There was none of the fuzzing around the edges there usually was. He didn't even have to imagine any of the details of her smile this time. It was there, right in front of him, the tiniest, cutest, most heartwarming thing he'd ever seen.

如今他又回到了自己最钟爱的梦境中；拥抱着她，仅仅享受着她近在咫尺的感觉。这个梦甚至比大多数时候都要美好；更加生动和强烈，没有了往常边缘的模糊。这次，他甚至无需想象她笑容的任何细节。那笑容就在眼前，是他所见过的最微小、最可爱、最温暖人心的景象。

Oh, hey, she was waking up. Her eyelids fluttered a few times and crept open a crack. Gods, he loved that shade of crystal blue her eyes were. He never got tired of staring at them. What could he do to make her happy in this dream? Hmm...

哦，嘿，她醒了。她的眼皮颤动了几下，缓缓睁开一条缝。天啊，他多么喜爱她那双晶莹剔透的蓝色眼睛。他从未厌倦凝视它们。在这个梦中，他能做些什么让她开心呢？嗯……

"Hey, beautiful. I'm going to make you breakfast in bed. Your favorites, all German food. How about some waffles? And if you're in the shower when I bring it in, maybe I'll help wash your back." He gave her a quick kiss, rolled over, and got out of the bed. He gave one look back. Asuka was lying as he'd left her, her wide blue eyes locked on him, a completely stunned look on her face. He winked and headed to the kitchen. Yeah, this was definitely a dream, a good dream. He was only this smooth in his dreams. If this was real, she'd have killed him by now, or he'd have said something really stupid that made her twitch. Man, this was great. Hopefully when he woke up the day would be this good too. Mmm, waffles.

嘿，美人儿。我要给你做一顿床上早餐，全是德国美食，你最爱的那种。来点华夫饼怎么样？如果你在我端进来时正在洗澡，或许我还可以帮你搓搓背。"他迅速吻了她一下，翻身下床。回头一瞥，只见明日香仍保持着他离开时的姿势，那双湛蓝的大眼睛紧紧盯着他，脸上满是震惊。他眨了眨眼，朝厨房走去。没错，这绝对是个梦，一个美梦。他在现实中可没这么潇洒。要是真的，她早就把他宰了，或者他说了什么蠢话让她翻白眼。哎呀，这感觉真棒。希望醒来后，这一天也能如此美好。嗯，华夫饼。

Asuka kept staring at the door he'd left through for a long time. "What the fuck just happened?" she finally asked the empty room.

明日香久久凝视着他离开的那扇门。"刚刚到底发生了什么鬼？"她最终向空荡荡的房间发问。

Ten minutes later, Shinji was still standing in the kitchen, staring fixedly at the tiny red spot on his hand where the sizzling grease from the bacon had spattered hot oil onto him. That had hurt. His hand hurt, he was hungry, and he had to go to the bathroom. Those things never happened in dreams. Ergo, this was not a dream. Everything that had happened since he had opened his eyes had been real. He'd just... he'd just... oh gods...

十分钟后，真嗣仍站在厨房里，目不转睛地盯着手背上那一点微小的红斑，那是煎培根时溅起的滚烫油脂留下的痕迹。那真的很痛。他的手在痛，他饿了，他还得去洗手间。这些事情在梦里从不会发生。因此，这不是梦。自从他睁开眼睛以来所发生的一切都是真实的。他只是……他只是……哦，天啊……

He'd kissed her. He'd kissed Asuka Langley Sohryu. While they were both awake and breathing just fine. On the upside, it had been really nice, much better than the other three kisses he'd ever had, and no one involved had been in danger of dying immediately afterward. Downside: that last part might only be until she saw him again. 'Oh gods, what did I just do? More importantly, what is she going to do?' So he'd frozen solid as soon as the realization had washed over him, and had stayed stuck that way until something worse had happened.

他吻了她。他吻了惣流·明日香·兰格雷。当时他们俩都清醒着，呼吸正常。从好的方面看，这个吻真的很美好，远胜于他此前的三次亲吻经历，而且事后双方都没有立即面临死亡的危险。不利的一面是：这最后一点可能只持续到她再次见到他为止。“哦，天哪，我刚刚做了什么？更重要的是，她会怎么做？”意识到这一点后，他立刻僵住了，一直保持那种状态，直到发生了更糟糕的事情。

He'd heard the shower start.

他听到了淋浴开启的声音。

He started to sweat. Daniel's talk last night about subtle signals started running through his head. She had just started the shower, and he'd just offered to wash her back. He'd just offered to wash her back. 'Ok, now either I'm still dreaming, or she just wants to be clean before she kills me.'

他开始冒汗。昨晚丹尼尔关于微妙信号的谈话开始在他脑海中回响。她刚打开淋浴，而他刚刚提出要帮她洗背。他刚刚提出要帮她洗背。“好吧，现在要么我还在做梦，要么她就是想在杀我之前先把自己洗干净。”

In the shower, an extremely confused Asuka Langley Sohryu washed her hair while her mind buzzed away at something else entirely. Or maybe not entirely; that was part of the problem.

在淋浴间，极度困惑的惣流·明日香·兰格雷一边洗着头发，一边心不在焉地思索着其他事情。或许并非完全无关；这正是问题的一部分。

She'd woken up feeling... great. Warm, comfortable, no nightmares... actually rested and peaceful. She'd just lain there, enjoying the pricelessly rare pleasant awakening. After a few minutes, she finally had registered the sensation that she was pressed up against something, there were still arms around her back, and there was gentle breath tickling at her eyelashes. She'd cracked her eyes open a slit to see the blurry face of the Third Child inches from her own. He'd said... something impossible, something about calling her beautiful, breakfast, waffles, and... OK, that last part couldn't be real. Offering to wash her back in the shower? The Third Child had then kissed her, immediately gotten out of bed, winked at her, and left the room. That couldn't have happened. That sort of behavior wasn't just impossible to imagine coming from the Third Child she knew, it was like something out of those ridiculous romance novels Hikari had used to read back in school, and occasionally foisted off on Asuka, over her protests of distaste.

她醒来时感觉……棒极了。温暖、舒适，没有噩梦……真正地休息和平静。她只是躺在那里，享受着这难得的愉悦苏醒。几分钟后，她才意识到自己紧贴着某物，背后仍有手臂环绕，还有轻柔的呼吸轻拂着她的睫毛。她微微睁开眼睛，看到第三适格者的模糊面庞近在咫尺。他说了些不可思议的话，关于赞美她美丽、早餐、华夫饼，还有……好吧，最后那部分肯定不是真的。提出在淋浴时帮她洗背？然后第三适格者吻了她，立刻下床，向她眨了眨眼，离开了房间。那不可能发生。这种行为不仅难以想象来自她所认识的第三适格者，更像是光在学校时读过的那些荒谬言情小说中的情节，偶尔还会不顾明日香的反感硬塞给她看。

The fact she'd surreptitiously read them herself late at night in her own room was irrelevant. And bitterly mocking and ironic considering what her 'love life' had turned into after the kaleidoscope of horrors that was the Third Impact and Instrumentality, plus four subsequent years of survival in the brutal and chaotic remnant world they left behind.

她自己深夜在房间里偷偷阅读这些信件的事实并不重要。考虑到第三次冲击和人类补完计划带来的恐怖万花筒，以及随后四年在残酷混乱的废土世界中的求生经历，她那所谓的“爱情生活”变得多么讽刺和可笑。

But now... she'd gone to sleep just hoping to exploit the blessed relief from her worsening nightmares that the Third's warmth by some means granted ...and somehow woken up in one of those novels? Or one of the similarly sentimental movies they'd sometimes watched at Hikari's house? She couldn't think of another explanation. She'd just stared at the Third's retreating back in shock as the most impossible bit of all still burned on her lips.

但现在……她只是希望借助第三者的温暖，以某种方式获得缓解日益恶化的噩梦的宝贵慰藉，便沉沉睡去……却不知怎地醒来时，发现自己仿佛置身于那些小说之中？或是他们有时在光家里观看的那些感伤电影之一？她想不出其他解释。当那最不可思议的部分仍灼烧在唇边时，她只是震惊地凝视着第三者离去的背影。

He'd... kissed her. The Third Child, Shinji Ikari, the most spineless, pathetic wimp she'd ever met, the emotionally crippled total doormat she'd always been able to cow into doing anything she'd demanded, had mutated overnight into a warm and confident Casanova who'd held her tight, called her beautiful, and then gently, briefly kissed her before strolling out of the room with a wink to make her breakfast in bed, with or without complimentary back washing as she desired.

他竟然吻了她。那个她所见过的最软弱、最可悲的窝囊废，第三适格者，碇真嗣，那个情感上残缺不全、总是任她摆布的受气包，一夜之间蜕变成了一个温暖而自信的卡萨诺瓦。他紧紧拥抱着她，称赞她美丽，然后温柔地、短暂地吻了她一下，眨眼间走出房间，去为她准备床上早餐，无论她是否需要额外的背部清洗服务，都随她心意。

The obvious explanation that it had to be a cheesy old-romance-novel-inspired dream had lasted until she'd dazedly stumbled into the shower and had the first blast of hot water smack her in the face. This was only after she'd laid there in the bed in the same pose she'd been in as he left for several minutes, trying to figure out what had just happened. And get her humming body to stop vibrating. Um.

显而易见的解释是，这必定是一场受老套言情小说启发的梦境，这一想法一直持续到她昏昏沉沉地走进浴室，被第一股热水迎面击中。在此之前，她躺在床上，保持着他离开时的姿势，一动不动地过了好几分钟，试图弄清楚刚刚发生了什么，并让那嗡嗡作响的身体停止颤动。嗯。

Ok, this kiss had been an entirely different character than the hollow, fake ones she'd endured with Jinnai, or the disgusting, intrusive ones from Winthrop. It had been more like her long ago first kiss, only natural as that too had been the Third Child. The kiss that had left her sobbing in the tiny bathroom she'd fled to, where his seeming frozen indifference had sent her fleeing to hide her crushing sadness at the rejection. The kiss that had left her body humming with the same burning interest in more, and weeping in agony that neither it nor her heart would be satisfied.

好吧，这个吻与她忍受过的与阵内那些空洞、虚假的吻，或是温思罗普那些令人厌恶、侵扰性的吻完全不同。它更像是她很久以前的初吻，同样自然而然，那也是与第三位孩子的吻。那个吻让她逃到狭小的洗手间里哭泣，他的冷漠似乎将她冻结，使她逃离以隐藏被拒绝的沉重悲伤。那个吻让她的身体因对更多的渴望而燃烧，痛苦地哭泣，因为无论是身体还是心灵都无法得到满足。

This kiss had been far more like that. If she hadn't been frozen in utter shock, she might not have been able to stop her hands from grabbing his shirt before he'd gotten out of range and dragging him back in for more, the far, far more that her body suddenly and insistently demanded. Even its brevity had only made the burn worse somehow, like the first touch of a match to dry tinder.

这个吻与此更为相似。若非她因极度震惊而僵住，或许她便无法抑制双手在他逃离范围之前抓住他的衬衫，将他拽回索取更多，那突然而强烈要求着的更多。即便其短暂，也莫名加剧了内心的灼热，犹如火柴初触干柴。

Asuka got a grip on herself and turned the water down colder. Ok, time to face it; for the first time since before the Third Impact she was no-doubt-about-it horny... and weirdest of all, the Third Child had been the cause. Maybe she'd once had daydreams like that, when tuning out he class's sensei's interminable droning about life before the Second Impact, usually featuring Kaji, but more and more before the end featuring a certain dark-haired Pilot...

明日香努力控制住自己，将水温调得更冷。好吧，是时候面对现实了；自从第三次冲击之前以来，她第一次毫无疑问地感到性欲旺盛……而最奇怪的是，第三适格者竟然是诱因。或许她曾经有过那样的白日梦，在课堂上无视老师关于第二次冲击前生活的无休止的唠叨时，通常主角是加持，但到最后，越来越多地出现了一个特定黑发驾驶员的身影……

She turned the water still colder. She did not need her body making her mind up for her right now. She needed to think straight. Not start wondering if she was really interested in seeing if the Third would actually come in here to wash her back if she stayed too long... and...

她将水温调得更冷了些。此刻她不需要身体替她做决定。她需要清醒思考。而不是开始琢磨自己是否真的好奇，如果她停留太久，第三者是否会真的进来帮她洗背……还有……

Where was she, again? She blinked and angrily twisted the water even colder. If the 'twins' were going to be obstinately perky, she was at least going to have it be for a nice, deniable reason. Ahem!

她又在哪里呢？她眨了眨眼，气愤地把水温调得更冷。如果那对“双胞胎”非要固执地保持活泼，她至少要让这成为一种可以否认的美好理由。咳咳！

She grasped at her anger, trying to bring her old familiar shield back to where it had so long ridden. Anger, and the fear that helped cement it in place. But now the fear wasn't the aid it had been for so long. It was stronger than the anger now. After years of just herself, all of a sudden she had so much more to lose; Her mother was just ten meters away, Kaji was alive, she was safe, her position as Pilot was secure. She should have felt more comfortable than ever. Instead... everything was changing. 'Damn it ,Third, you were supposed to be the constant, the reliable same old wimp. Now you've turned into Shinji the Casanova. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Better question; what am I going to do if he actually walks in here to 'wash my back'? Scheiße, what do I want to happen?' Adrenalin had her heart pounding now, equal parts fear he would come in and fear he wouldn't.

她试图抓住愤怒，试图将那久经沙场的熟悉盾牌重新竖起。愤怒，以及那曾长久巩固它的恐惧。但如今，恐惧已不再是曾经的助力，它比愤怒更为强大。多年来，她只有自己，突然间，她有了太多可失去的东西；母亲仅在十米之外，加持还活着，她安全无虞，驾驶员的地位稳固。她本应感到前所未有的安心。然而……一切都在改变。“该死，第三，你本该是那个不变的、可靠的胆小鬼。现在你却变成了情场高手真嗣。我他妈该怎么办？更确切的问题是；如果他真的走进来要‘帮我擦背’，我该怎么办？该死，我到底希望发生什么？”肾上腺素让她的心跳加速，一半是害怕他进来，一半是害怕他不进来。

She found herself starting to shake, and not from the near ice water she'd turned the shower down to. 'Too fast...too fast.' Sudden decision seized her, though perhaps only a shade's difference between it and panic. She wasn't... she wasn't ready for that. Not yet. Maybe not never, but definitely not yet. There was too much undone and unsaid between them. She didn't want anything to start this way. Not like this. ''Forgive yourself'. That's something I forgot to do yesterday. It's...maybe it's time to try some of that.'

她发现自己开始颤抖，并非因为将淋浴调至近乎冰冷的水温。'太快了...太快了。'突如其来的决定攫住了她，尽管这决定与恐慌之间仅一线之隔。她还没有...还没有准备好。至少现在不行。或许永远也不会，但绝对不是现在。他们之间还有太多未完成和未说出口的事。她不希望任何事情以这种方式开始。不是这样的。'原谅自己'。那是昨天我忘记做的事。现在...或许是时候尝试一下了。

She shut down the water. She stepped out of the spacious shower stall and pulled on the fluffy, crimson bathrobe that hung on a hook next to it. No need to ask who that was meant for; a purple mate hung right next to it. The cold water had kept the mirror from fogging, and Asuka stared back at her reflection. 'Forgive myself? Who are you? What do you want?' she thought. 'I am... I am Asuka. I am the Great Asuka Langley Sohryu, the Second Child, Slayer of Angels. I shot the dictator Winthrop. I want my mother back; done. I want... I want my life back in my own hands. I'm tired of being afraid of going to sleep. I'm tired of constantly waking up from nightmares every fucking night. 'That was an echo of what they feel all the time'? Then I want that. I want to feel like that again. I want to wake up and feel like that every morning. If the Third Child... ...no. No more of that, you damn coward. I'm tired of that. If Shinji has the guts to do that, to 'push back' just like I said, then I better have just as much. There's no way I'm not going to match him. I'm not going to let him beat me, not even at something like this. Not one step back!

她关闭了水源。从宽敞的淋浴间走出，披上挂在旁边挂钩上的蓬松深红色浴袍。无需问这是为谁准备的；旁边就挂着一件紫色的。冷水使镜子免于雾气，明日香凝视着镜中的自己。'原谅自己？你是谁？你想要什么？'她思索着。'我是...我是明日香。我是伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索菲尔，第二适格者，天使杀手。我射杀了独裁者温斯洛普。我想要母亲回来；完成。我想要...我想要自己的生活重回掌控。我厌倦了害怕入睡。我厌倦了每晚从噩梦中不断惊醒。'那一直是他们的常态感受'？那我也要那样。我想再次那样感受。我想每天早晨醒来都有那种感觉。如果第三适格者... ...不。不再那样了，你这该死的懦夫。我厌倦了。如果真嗣有勇气去做，像我说的那样'反击'，那我必须同样有。我绝不会在这点上输给他。我不会让他在这件事上胜过我。一步也不退让！

The part of Asuka that had spent the last sixteen years keeping everyone away from her heart tried to scream, tried to slam the door closed again. She would be hurt. No one wants her. Everyone leaves. He'd leave. She was an evil, useless, unlovable, worthless bitch. She'd be safer the way she always had been. No one close. Keep him away. Keep Mama away. They could hurt her the most.

十六年来一直将所有人拒之心门之外的那部分明日香试图尖叫，试图再次将门紧闭。她会受伤的。没人想要她。每个人都会离开。他也会离开。她是个邪恶、无用、不可爱、毫无价值的贱人。像往常一样，没有人靠近她会更安全。让他远离。让妈妈远离。他们最能伤害她。

Suddenly, Asuka found her anger again, and turned it on the fear. 'No! No no no! I will not! Nightmares be damned, I will not run and hide from my own mother! I felt her when I fought! Mama loves me! She will not reject me! She's right down the hall now! I can see her, touch her, hold her hand! She is mine! And the Third swore to me!' You're going to trust in the word of the wimp who left you to fight alone and die? 'He will not leave me! He looks at me! He always looks at me! And now he held me! He kissed me! Me! Not Wondergirl, not anyone else, me!' He left. He'll do it again. 'He did not leave me, Winthrop took him! He fought for me! He protected my life when no one else would, not even me!' He owed you a life anyway. 'And he was ready to give another one for me in the coup! 'Don't let yours go,' that other 'me' said. No one is going to take him from me!' You're not worth it. He doesn't want you. 'He is mine! Mine! Do you hear me? No one is taking anything from me! I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I am not afraid! Because...'

突然，明日香再次找到了她的愤怒，并将之转向恐惧。'不！不不不！我绝不会！噩梦去死吧，我不会因为自己的母亲而逃跑和躲藏！我在战斗中感受到了她！妈妈爱我！她不会拒绝我！她现在就在走廊那头！我能看见她，触摸她，握住她的手！她是我的！而且第三适格者向我发过誓！'你打算相信那个把你丢下独自战斗至死的懦夫的话吗？'他不会离开我！他看着我！他总是看着我！现在他抱过我！他吻了我！是我！不是 Wondergirl，不是其他人，是我！'他离开了。他会再次这么做。'他没有离开我，是温思罗普带走了他！他为我和我战斗！当没有人，甚至我自己都不愿意时，他保护了我的生命！'他本来就欠你一条命。'而且在政变中，他准备再为我牺牲一次！'不要放弃你的，'那个另一个'我'说。没有人能把他从我身边夺走！'你不值得。他不需要你。'他是我的！我的！你听见了吗？没有人能从我这里夺走任何东西！我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我不害怕！因为……'

"There Is No Such Thing As Fear," she growled to her reflection. She was almost surprised to see her reflection starting to grin back at her. Her heart was pounding again, but this time the fear was pushed far, far down, and just the adrenalin of excitement powered her. The nervousness was still there, but now it had the tingle of anticipation flavoring it, the same way she used to feel before a fight. Was this a battle, now? She was at the controls, either way.

"没有所谓的恐惧,"她对着镜中的自己低吼。她几乎惊讶地看到自己的倒影开始向她咧嘴笑。心跳再次加速，但这次恐惧被深深压下，只剩下兴奋的肾上腺素驱动着她。紧张感依旧存在，但现在它被期待的刺痛所调味，就像她过去战斗前的感觉一样。这难道是一场战斗吗？无论如何，她现在掌控着局面。

'Alright, then where am I going?' She hurriedly dried her hair and wrapped it up in a red towel. 'Who am I going to find out there; Don Juan or Don Wimp? I may not be ready for him to wash my back, but I feel like breakfast in bed, alright. Let's see who brings it in and give him another push.' She nodded at herself in the mirror. "Let's go, Asuka." She turned to the door to the bedroom and opened it.

“好吧，那我该去哪儿呢？”她急忙擦干头发，用一条红毛巾裹起来。“我要去找谁呢，唐璜还是唐懦夫？我可能还没准备好让他帮我擦背，但我现在想在床上吃早餐，行吧。看看是谁送来的，再给他点动力。”她对着镜子里的自己点了点头。“走吧，明日香。”她转向卧室的门，打开了它。

### Chapter 14 The Only Question That Ever Matters

shinji heard the water stop, and didn't know whether he should sigh in relief or disappointment. He'd had the breakfast tray filled and ready for the last couple of minutes, minutes that he'd spent staring at the dishes he'd readied and the rose in a small vase he had the house system provide on his request, trying to nerve himself up to pick it up and carry it into the bedroom. It had proved to be a difficult struggle. But now the water had stopped. Either Asuka didn't want him to come redeem his offer, or she'd gotten tired of waiting. In either case, he wasn't going to gain anything by standing here until she came out to find him. Picking up the tray and holding it in front of him like a shield, he carried it into the bedroom.

真嗣听到水声停了，不知道是该松一口气还是感到失望。他早已将早餐托盘装满，准备就绪，这几分钟里，他一直盯着那些准备好的餐盘和那朵由家居系统应他要求提供的小花瓶中的玫瑰，试图鼓起勇气拿起托盘走进卧室。这成了一场艰难的挣扎。但现在水声已停。要么是明日香不想让他来履行承诺，要么是她等得不耐烦了。无论哪种情况，他站在这里等她出来找自己都无济于事。他拿起托盘，像举着盾牌一样端在身前，走进了卧室。

Asuka was waiting for him. Wrapped in a blood-red bathrobe and towel, she was curled up in the bed like a ruby cat, slender fingers tapping gently together as she watched him like a hawk as he carried the tray in. Good gods,she looked hot. Her oh gods long, smooth legs peeking out from the edge of the robe were—'FOCUS, Ikari!' He saw her eyebrow rise when she spotted the rose.

明日香正在等他。她裹着一件血红色的浴袍和毛巾，蜷缩在床上，宛如一只红宝石般的猫，纤细的手指轻轻地相互敲击，目光如鹰隼般紧盯着他端着托盘进来。天哪，她看起来真性感。那双修长光滑的腿从浴袍边缘露出——“集中精神，碇！”当他注意到她看到玫瑰时，她的眉毛微微一挑。

"My, my, Third. How fancy. Finally treating me as you should, I see," was all she said.

哎呀，第三，真讲究。终于像样地对待我了，我明白了。

'Alright, she hasn't killed me yet. So far, so good. She's not giving me a lot of cues to go by either, though. She doesn'tlookmad, but this is Asuka, so it's probably a safe assumption. Please don't let me screw this up!' He carefully placed the tray on the bed between them. The bed was wide enough that they could have the breakfast tray in the middle and still have plenty of space to lie on each side. Shinji lay down opposite her and fiddled with his own small plate of toast. "Well, we had an... um... unusual day yesterday. I got my parents back, but your day seemed a bit more... um... filled with difficult revelations. I figured you should have a nice and easy day today. Breakfast in bed felt like a good place to start." 'Don't say 'I'm sorry', or she'll kill me. Don't say 'I'm sorry', or she'll kill me. Don't say 'I'm sorry', or she'll kill me.'

好吧，她还没杀我。到目前为止，一切顺利。她也没给我太多暗示，不过她看起来并不生气，但考虑到这是明日香，这个假设应该还算安全。千万别让我搞砸了！他小心翼翼地将托盘放在两人之间的床上。床足够宽敞，中间放着早餐托盘，两边仍有充足的空间躺下。真嗣在她对面躺下，摆弄着自己的一小盘吐司。“嗯，我们昨天经历了一个……呃……不寻常的一天。我找回了父母，而你的日子似乎更……呃……充满了艰难的真相。我想你今天应该过得轻松愉快。床上早餐是个不错的开始。”“别说‘对不起’，否则她会杀了我。别说‘对不起’，否则她会杀了我。别说‘对不起’，否则她会杀了我。”

Asuka gave him a level stare. "Careful, Third, I might get used to this." Her eyes drifted to the dish at the center of her side. "Well, well. Waffles. As... promised." She looked him right in the eyes again, very calmly challenging him without a word.

明日香平静地盯着他，说道：“小心点，老三，我可能会习惯这个。”她的目光飘向自己面前的那盘食物，“哦，哦，是华夫饼。正如……所承诺的。”她再次直视他的眼睛，平静地用沉默向他发出挑战。

Shinji managed to keep himself from audibly swallowing, but could not stop the bead of sweat he felt trickling down his left temple. He had the strong feeling that squeaking 'Oh, you were awake for that?' would not get a positive reaction. Alas, her lack of cues was leaving him completely unsure if he should even mention... the... rest... oh dear. If she was awake enough to hear and remember the 'waffles' bit, she had to be awake for the 'wash your back' part... and the kiss. 'Oh gods... 'Don't say 'I'm sorry', or she'll kill me. 'Don't say 'I'm sorry', or she'll kill me. But now what? Is she mad? Think FAST, Ikari!'

真嗣努力控制住自己没有发出吞咽声，却无法阻止一滴汗水从左太阳穴滑落。他强烈感觉到，如果怯生生地问一句“哦，你那时候醒着啊？”恐怕不会得到什么好反应。唉，她毫无提示，让他完全不确定是否该提及……剩下的……哦天哪。如果她清醒到能听见并记住“华夫饼”那部分，那她肯定也听到了“帮你洗背”和那个吻。“哦，天啊……”“别说‘对不起’，否则她会杀了我。”“别说‘对不起’，否则她会杀了我。”但现在怎么办？她生气了吗？快想，碇！

"It... it took me a little while to make it all. I'm sorry..." Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "...if I took too long. You got out of the shower fairly quickly." Her eyes widened right back up. 'Whew! Ok, ball's back in your court, Asuka. You'vegotto give me some clue how you feel about all this to reply to that! ...right?'

“这...我花了点时间才弄好。对不起...”她的眼神变得危险起来，“...如果我耽搁太久了。你倒是很快就洗完澡出来了。”她的眼睛随即又睁大了。“呼！好吧，球又回到你那边了，明日香。你得给我点提示，让我知道你对这一切的感受，我才能回应啊！...对吧？”

Shinji spared a second's thought at how lucky he was that he found her sapphire eyes so captivating. The red bathrobe was clinging to all her curves, and the relatively loose tie up front was giving an extremely tempting glimpse of her ivory skin and cleavage, especially as she was now half reclined to start taking bites of the breakfast he'd brought in. Yes, this would probably be a bad time for his eyes to get caught diving between her slightly exposed breasts, that still had little drops of water clinging—Eyes UP, Ikari!

碇真嗣不禁感慨自己何其幸运，竟能被她那双蓝宝石般的眼睛深深吸引。红色浴袍紧贴着她的曲线，而前襟相对宽松的系带更是诱人地透露出她象牙色的肌肤和乳沟，尤其是此刻她半躺着开始享用他带来的早餐时。没错，这时候他的目光若被她微露的胸脯间那几滴未干的水珠吸引过去，可就不妙了——抬头，碇！

She finished her bite of waffle and looked back up at him, thankfully one second after he'd managed to bring his own eyes back from their little safari south. Her oh-so-damn-blue eyes were boring into his in a frightening new way; there was barely a trace of the bitterness or cynical anger that nearly always haunted them since they'd awoken on that blood-tinted beach four years ago. She was just looking at him, her gaze as plain and clear as he'd ever seen it. And it was terrifying in its openness. Shinji fought not to start shaking.

她吃完那一口华夫饼，抬头望向他，幸好是在他刚把目光从那短暂的南方探险中收回的一秒后。她那双该死的蓝眼睛以一种令人心悸的新方式直视着他；自从四年前在那片血色染红的沙滩上醒来后，几乎一直萦绕其间的苦涩或愤世嫉俗的怒火已不见踪影。她就那样看着他，眼神是他从未见过的坦率与清澈。这份坦诚无遮，令人心生畏惧。真嗣努力克制着不让自己颤抖起来。

"So," Asuka said with frightening calm, "If I'd still been in the shower, would I be seeing you coming in?"

“那么，”明日香以令人不安的平静说道，“如果我还在洗澡，我会看到你进来吗？”

Shinji's pulse stated climbing a little further towards the ionosphere. This was not quite giving him any clues as to how to jump. Or if it was, they were clues in a very scary direction. One that he was definitely not sure he was ready for outside of his dreams. The last step he'd tried in that direction had ended with Asuka weeping next to him in the bed for half the night, and himself feeling little better.

真嗣的心跳继续向电离层攀升。这并未给他任何关于如何跳跃的线索。即便有，也是指向一个极其可怕的方向，一个他在梦境之外绝不确定自己是否准备好的方向。上次他尝试朝那个方向迈出的一步，结果是明日香在床边哭泣了半个夜晚，而他自己也感觉好不到哪里去。

Asuka continued in that same terrifying calm after the barest pause, "I seem to recall you saying something about 'washing my back', right before you..."

明日香在短暂的停顿后，依旧保持着那令人胆寒的平静，继续说道：“我记得你好像说过什么‘帮我洗背’，就在你……之前。”

'I'm sor—' Shinji bit his tongue, hard. 'Don't say it! Don't say it! Don't even think it! Not now! This is what I've spent the last three yearsdreamingabout! She's here, right in front of me, and talking right to me, just like I wanted! If only I had some idea of what tosay!'

'我很抱——' 真嗣狠狠地咬了下舌头。'别说！别说！连想都别想！现在不行！这是我过去三年里梦寐以求的！她就在我面前，正对着我说话，就像我期望的那样！要是我知道该说什么就好了！'

"Right before I kissed you," he heard himself say.

就在我吻你之前，"他听到自己说道。

The air in the room positively rang in the silence that followed. Asuka's eyes were absolutely magnetic now. He could not look away.

房间里的空气在随后的寂静中仿佛发出回响。明日香的眼神此刻极具磁性，他无法移开视线。

"Yes," she finally said, after a long, heart stopping moment for Shinji. "Before you kissed me. Did you mean it?"

"是的，"她终于说道，在让真嗣心跳停止的漫长时刻之后。"在你吻我之前。你是真心的吗？"

"I... I m-meant it. Do... do you want me to?" Shinji could not prevent his voice from climbing some, but at least kept it from withering to a squeak.

"我...我是认真的。你...你想让我这么做吗？" 尽管声调不由自主地升高了些，但至少没有变成尖细的颤音。

Asuka held his eyes for another agonizingly long moment. "No."

明日香又痛苦地凝视了他良久，“不。”

Shinji could not contain the almost octave-higher "No?" that escaped him.

真嗣无法抑制那几乎高了一个八度的“不？”从他口中逃逸而出。

Asuka calmly took another bite of waffle and looked back at him. "Not yet."

明日香平静地又咬了一口华夫饼，然后回头看向他。“还没。”

Shinji's heart filed a formal complaint about all the near-heart-attacks he was registering this morning, and threatened to pull the plug on him staying conscious if he kept this up.

真嗣的心脏今早正式投诉了那些差点引发心脏骤停的惊吓，并威胁说如果他再这样下去，就要让他失去意识。

"I'm rather impressed you'd make the offer, Third. I didn't think you had it in you, or wanted to," she continued. "You haven't even so much as tried to touch me since... that first time. Even though I offered." He could now detect a faint, strained note underlying her calm tone. She looked up from her plate and stopped. Her stare bore a close resemblance to a laser, now.

我倒是挺佩服你提出这个建议的，老三。我没想到你会有这心思，或者说愿意这么做，"她继续说道，"自从那第一次之后，你甚至都没有试图碰过我。尽管我曾主动过。"他现在能听出她平静语调下隐约的紧张。她从盘子上抬起头，停了下来。此刻，她的目光犀利得如同激光一般。

"I'm sorry." The laser took on a painfully familiar hostile edge. Shinji swallowed through a suddenly bone dry throat and pressed on. "I... I want to. You are beautiful, Asuka. You are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I... I want to be with you, but I can't... I can't... I won't do things that hurt you. That night, when we... when I tried to... to..." He looked down and flushed bright red. "To have sex with you... I could see... that what I was doing was hurting you. I... I... I want to help you somehow and be with you forever. But I can't do anything that hurts you, not like that. When you are hurt, I feel it too. I can't hurt you, Asuka. I've already hurt you enough before, and you... mean too much ...to me." Shinji couldn't look up from the spot on the sheets in front of him. "I know you don't think much of philosophy, Asuka, but that's something I learned when I was studying in Boston; I can't accept happiness that is bought with someone else's pain. Especially if it's yours. When you are unhappy, I'm unhappy too."

"对不起。" 那道激光带着一种令人痛苦地熟悉的敌意。真嗣咽了咽突然干涩的喉咙，继续说道："我...我想。你很美，明日香。你是我见过的最美丽的女孩。我...我想和你在一起，但我不能...我不能...我不会做伤害你的事。那晚，当我们...当我们试图...试图..." 他低下头，脸涨得通红。"试图和你发生关系...我能看出...我所做的正在伤害你。我...我...我想以某种方式帮助你，永远和你在一起。但我不能做任何伤害你的事，绝不能那样。当你受伤时，我也能感受到。我不能伤害你，明日香。我之前已经伤害你够多了，而你...对我来说意义重大。" 真嗣无法从面前的床单上抬起头来。"我知道你不太看重哲学，明日香，但那是我曾在波士顿学习时学到的东西；我无法接受以他人痛苦为代价换来的幸福。尤其是你的。当你不快乐时，我也不快乐。"

Shinji trailed off into silence. When the quiet grew long, he finally nerved himself to look back up at her.

真嗣的声音渐渐消失在沉默中。当寂静持续了一段时间后，他终于鼓起勇气再次抬头看向她。

She was staring at him, eyes as wide as he'd ever seen. Her lips were moving as if she was whispering something, but he didn't hear anything. She blinked and focused back in on him, eyes narrowing a bit. "'I want to help you somehow and be with you forever.' You've said that before, during... Instrumentality. I refused you then. You just wanted someone, anyone to take care of you. It could have been Misato, Wondergirl, anybody."

她凝视着他，双眼睁得比以往任何时候都要大。她的嘴唇在动，仿佛在低语着什么，但他什么也没听见。她眨了眨眼，重新将注意力集中在他身上，眼神略微变得锐利。“‘我想以某种方式帮助你，永远和你在一起。’你曾在……在人类补完计划时说过这话。我当时拒绝了你。你只是想找个人，任何人来照顾你。可以是美里，可以是绫波，任何人都可以。”

"No," Shinji somehow found the will to reply. "Just you... just you. I lost Rei and I kept going. I lost Kaworu and I kept going. I lost Misato and I kept going. Then I lost you... I failed you... and I couldn't..." He pinched his eyes shut, unable to keep looking her in the eye when saying this. "I... when I begged you to help me... and you refused, with the whole human race being destroyed... I'm no better than you, Asuka. They were only being destroyed because of me in the first place." 'Rayana was right. I'm no better than my father. I'd destroy the whole world for one person.'"I... I attacked you because it hurt so much. I thought you, you of all people would understand. I needed you. You were the one who was so much like me. When you rejected me... I thought… if you would reject me, then no one else could possibly want me. You were all my hope, Asuka."

"不，" 真嗣不知怎地找到了回应的勇气。"只有你...只有你。我失去了绫波，我继续前行。我失去了薰，我继续前行。我失去了美里，我继续前行。然后我失去了你...我辜负了你...我做不到..." 他说到这里，紧闭双眼，无法再直视她的眼睛。"我...当我恳求你帮助我时...而你拒绝了，整个人类即将毁灭...我并不比你强，明日香。他们之所以毁灭，归根结底是因为我。" 蕾雅娜说得对，我并不比我父亲好。我愿意为了一个人毁灭整个世界。"我...我攻击你是因为太痛苦了。我以为你，你这样的人会理解。我需要你。你是最像我的那个人。当你拒绝我时...我以为…如果连你都拒绝我，那就没有人会接纳我了。你是我全部的希望，明日香。"

"I rejected you. Even at that price. The whole of humanity's survival wasn't enough to overcome my pride." Asuka's voice was as dry as ash. "I'd rather see everyone lost than unbend enough to help even someone as low as you. ...so why are you still here? I'm terrible. I sold myself to Winthrop rather than talk to you. Why... why are you still looking at me? I've never given you anything. Your whole life would be better without me. Why do you keep coming back? Why are you still looking at me?" When Shinji raised his head again, it was her this time that couldn't meet his gaze. He could see her starting to shake. "I'm filthy. I call you stupid and yell at you for trying to protect people. I hurt you without even thinking. Why did you hold me? Why did you call me beautiful? Why did you... kiss me?" Her eyes snapped back to his. "Tell me why," she said, her voice barely audible.

"我拒绝了你。即便代价如此。整个人类的存亡都不足以让我放下自尊。"明日香的声音干涩如灰烬。"我宁愿看着所有人迷失，也不愿屈尊去帮助像你这样卑微的人。...那你为什么还留在这里？我很糟糕。我宁愿把自己卖给温思罗普，也不愿与你交谈。为什么...为什么你还看着我？我从未给予你任何东西。没有我，你的整个人生会更好。为什么你还要回来？为什么你还看着我？"当真嗣再次抬头时，这次是她无法直视他的目光。他看到她开始颤抖。"我肮脏。我骂你愚蠢，对你试图保护他人大发雷霆。我甚至不经思考就伤害了你。为什么你要抱住我？为什么你要说我美丽？为什么你要...吻我？"她的目光猛地回到他身上。"告诉我为什么，"她低声说，声音几乎听不见。

"You... you're not terrible, Asuka. I called you beautiful because... because you are. I spent I don't know how long after I woke up just staring at your smile, because it was the most wonderful thing I've seen in years. I held you because I felt more... happy, more alive when I did it than any other time in my life. I kissed you because..." He closed his eyes to pen in the tears that threatened to escape. 'Because I've wanted to for years. Because I dream about it all the time. Because a world without you lacks any other meaning for me. Because I think I love you. Saysomething, Ikari!'"Because I thought I was dreaming a good dream, and I wanted to make you happy. I know I was awake now...and I would still do it again."

你...你并不糟糕，明日香。我称你为美丽是因为...因为你确实如此。我醒来后不知过了多久，只是凝视着你的笑容，因为那是我多年来见过的最美好的事物。我拥抱你是因为我感到比以往任何时候都更...快乐，更有生机。我吻你是因为...”他闭上眼睛，忍住即将溢出的泪水。“因为我多年来一直渴望这样做。因为我总是梦见它。因为一个没有你的世界对我来说失去了所有意义。因为我可能真的爱上了你。说点什么，碇！”“因为我以为我在做一个美梦，我想让你快乐。现在我知道我是清醒的...我仍然愿意再次这样做。”

The silence stretched until Shinji could barely stand it. Behind his still closed eyes, he waited for the slap, the scream at him to get out, to get his perverted face away from her, to leave her alone. Everything he'd always gotten, always expected from her. He tensed himself to run the moment it began.

沉默持续到真嗣几乎无法忍受。他紧闭双眼，等待着那一巴掌，等待着她尖叫着让他滚出去，让他那变态的脸远离她，让他别再烦她。这一切，他总是从她那里得到，也总是预料到的。他绷紧身体，准备在那一刻开始时逃跑。

It did not come. He faintly heard Asuka whispering something, over and over. He forced his eyes open. She was staring at the tray, her lips moving over and over in one repeated phrase.

它没有到来。他隐约听到明日香在低声重复着什么。他强迫自己睁开眼睛。她正盯着托盘，嘴唇不停地重复着同一句话。

Abruptly she stopped, took a deep breath, and looked up at him again. Her eyes glittered as she coolly and steadily laid out damning words. "I have been a hideous bitch to you since the moment we first saw each other. I hurt you every time I open my mouth. I turned your First Kiss into a mockery because I told you I was bored. I was too much a coward to say what I really wanted. I fell apart as a Pilot because I couldn't keep ahead of you. I cursed you for failing to help me when I needed you, even though you were as much a wreck as I had been an hour before. You kept me alive for six months after the end of the world, and in return I sold my body to a brutal thug because I was a coward. I blamed you for leaving me when it wasn't your fault. I called you a fool for caring about anyone but yourself when the secret police hauled away random people in the streets. I hurt you as badly as I could possibly think of when you had the gall to stop me from killing myself in despair. I forced you to kill with me when I knew how much you hated it. I wouldn't even let you finish asking me if I cared about you before I told you 'No'. I told you 'No' and still surrendered to you when I thought I didn't deserve it and did not even expect you to say 'Yes'. I have never had the courage to ask the reverse. I demanded unconditional affection and closeness from you and did not give anything back because I was too afraid to let anyone near me, but couldn't bear to let you go. I just demanded you be there for me. I have brought you nothing but pain from the day we met. I am a liar, a whore, and an evil black-souled bitch whose own mother and father didn't want her. I am undeserving of any love. And I have flatly said to your face that I do not love you. All that, and you are still here."

她突然停下，深吸一口气，再次抬头望向他。她的双眼闪烁着冷静而坚定的光芒，字字诛心：“自我们初见那一刻起，我就对你刻薄至极。每次开口，都伤你至深。我将你的初吻变成了一场嘲弄，只因我告诉你我感到无聊。我太过懦弱，不敢吐露真心。作为飞行员，我崩溃了，因为我无法超越你。我责怪你在我需要时未能伸出援手，尽管一小时前你也同样狼狈不堪。在世界末日后，你让我活了六个月，而我却因懦弱将身体出卖给了一个残暴的恶棍。我怪你离我而去，却不知那并非你的错。我骂你愚蠢，只因你在秘密警察当街抓人时还关心他人。当你大胆阻止我绝望自杀时，我想尽办法伤害你。我逼你与我一同杀人，明知你对此深恶痛绝。甚至在你还未问完我是否在乎你之前，我就断然回答‘不’。” 我曾对你说“不”，却仍在自认为不配时向你屈服，甚至未曾期待你会说“是”。我从未有勇气反问。我向你索取无条件的关爱与亲近，却因害怕让人靠近而未曾回报，但又无法忍受失去你。我只要求你在我身边。自我们相遇之日起，我带给你的只有痛苦。我是个骗子，是个荡妇，是个内心邪恶、连父母都不愿要的贱人。我不配得到任何爱。我曾当面对你直言我不爱你。即便如此，你仍在这里。"

She closed her eyes for a long breath. She pushed the breakfast tray out from between them and locked eyes with him more intensely than he'd ever seen before. "And you are still looking at me, Shinji. So no more running away. I've finally found the courage to ask; Shinji Ikari, do..." Her fists tightened around handfuls of the sheets until they were shaking and white. They shook, but her eyes never wavered. "Do you... love me?"

她闭上眼睛深吸了一口气。她将早餐托盘从两人之间推开，然后以一种他从未见过的强烈目光与他四目相对。“而你仍在看着我，真嗣。所以不要再逃避了。我终于鼓起了勇气问你；碇真嗣，你……”她的拳头紧紧攥着床单，直到它们颤抖着变得苍白。尽管手在颤抖，但她的眼神始终坚定不移。“你……爱我吗？”

Holding her gaze was the hardest thing Shinji had ever done. The hardest thing he'd ever do, besides answering her. His heart pounded until it threatened to burst out of his chest. He licked dry lips and gathered every scrap of courage he had into the willpower to force one word out past his trembling lips.

直视她的目光是真嗣所做过的最艰难的事。除了回答她之外，这是他将要做的最艰难的事。他的心跳得如此剧烈，仿佛要破胸而出。他舔了舔干涩的嘴唇，将所有的勇气汇聚成一股意志力，强迫自己颤抖的嘴唇吐出一个字。

"Yes." 是的。

"S-say it. P-please...I need to hear you say it."

说出来吧，求你了……我需要听到你亲口说。

"...I love you, Asuka Langley Sohryu," he breathed like a prayer.

"...我爱你，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，" 他低语如祷告。

"...why?" she said in a very soft whisper.

"...为什么？"她轻声细语地说。

"What?" "什么？"

She didn't seem aware of the tear that had started to trickle down her face. "Why? I didn't have to tell you all those horrible things about me. I did most of them to you. How can you still bear to look at me? I've hurt you in every way I could to keep you away. How can you still love me?"

她似乎并未察觉到脸颊上悄然滑落的泪珠。“为什么？我本不必向你吐露那些关于我的可怕事情。我大多都是对你做的。你怎么还能忍受看着我？我用尽一切方式伤害你，只为让你远离。你怎么还能爱我？”

"Because just being around you makes me feel more alive. Because you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Because when I see you smile, the whole world glows. Because when I kiss you I feel like I'm on fire. Because when I held you I didn't care about anything else. Because I can't imagine a world without you. Because..." His voice broke. "Because when you are happy, it makes me feel the same. When you cry, I cry. When you hurt, I hurt."

因为仅仅是待在你身边，我就感觉自己更加生机勃勃。因为你是我见过的最美丽的女孩。因为当我看到你微笑时，整个世界都亮了起来。因为当我吻你时，我感觉自己像着了火。因为当我抱着你时，我不在乎其他任何事。因为我无法想象一个没有你的世界。因为……”他的声音哽咽了，“因为当你快乐时，我也感同身受。当你哭泣，我也哭泣。当你受伤，我也受伤。”

She was shaking like a leaf in a sharp breeze. 'Be honest and don't be afraid covered. Time to be there for her,'he thought. Shinji pushed the breakfast tray further out of the way and scooted across the gap between them. He tried to ignore how badly his hands were shaking as he pulled her to rest against his chest. The tingling buzz he started to get from feeling her damp hair against his t-shirt and her warm weight against his body helped.

她颤抖得如同疾风中的树叶。'要诚实，别害怕，是时候支持她了，'他心想。真嗣将早餐托盘推得更远，挪动身体跨越了他们之间的距离。他试图忽略自己双手的剧烈颤抖，将她拉到胸前倚靠。感受到她湿漉漉的头发贴在 T 恤上，以及她温暖的身体重量，这种微妙的触感让他开始感到一丝慰藉。

"When I woke up, I was holding you, and you were smiling. I've had dreams like that, so I thought... it was another one. So I did what I liked to do in those dreams; I tried to make you happy," he said.

当我醒来时，我正抱着你，而你在微笑。我做过那样的梦，所以我想……这又是其中一个。于是我做了那些梦里我喜欢做的事；我试图让你开心，”他说。

Asuka placed her arms on his where they wrapped around her and pulled them tighter. "I... I kept having nightmares last night," she said. "Bad ones, worse than usual. I kept waking up. And...and when we were napping yesterday, I didn't have any. And I think it was because..." Asuka took a deep breath. "Because I was holding on to you when I woke up. I was so cold, and didn't want to have more nightmares, so I... I... moved over so you could keep me warm. You put your arm around me. I wasn't cold anymore, and I didn't have more nightmares. I... used you, but... thank you."

明日香将手臂放在他环绕着自己的手臂上，用力拉紧。“我……昨晚一直在做噩梦，”她说，“很糟糕，比平时更甚。我不断醒来。而且……昨天我们小憩时，我一个梦都没做。我想那是因为……”明日香深吸了一口气，“因为当我醒来时，我正紧紧抓着你。我感到非常冷，不想再做噩梦，所以我就……我……挪过去，希望你能让我保持温暖。你伸手揽住了我。我不再感到寒冷，也没有再做噩梦。我……利用了你，但是……谢谢你。”

Shinji was glad she couldn't see him blush with her head tucked under his chin. "You were crying in your sleep again yesterday, during that nap. You do that... too much. I hate hearing it. But yesterday, when I heard you doing it again, and I'd just swore to you I'd do anything to take away your pain... I couldn't just listen anymore. I swear I was just trying to pull you a little closer to... to... I don't know, give you a hug in your sleep, hoping it would help. You rolled all the way over and grabbed on to me. You stopped crying, so I just stayed like that. You seemed happy."

真嗣庆幸她看不见自己脸红，她的头正埋在他的下巴下。“你昨天午睡时又梦里哭了。你这样……太频繁了。我讨厌听到。但昨天，当我再次听到你哭泣，我刚向你发誓要尽我所能消除你的痛苦……我再也无法只是听着。我发誓我只是想把你拉近一点，为了……为了……我不知道，想在你睡着时给你一个拥抱，希望这能有所帮助。你完全翻过身来，紧紧抓住了我。你停止了哭泣，所以我就那样保持不动。你看起来很开心。”

She twisted enough in his arms to get a look at his face. "You did what, Third Child? You? Reached out to me?" A familiar cynical flavor had reappeared in her voice, but he could hear the amused note with it this time.

她在他怀里扭动着，足以看清他的脸。“你做了什么，第三适格者？你？主动联系我？”她声音中熟悉的讽刺意味再次出现，但这次他也能听出其中的笑意。

He felt a smile growing as he nodded down to her upturned face. "I promised."

他感受到微笑在脸上蔓延，低头看着她仰起的脸，点头道：“我承诺过。”

She met his smile for a moment, then untwisted to her previous position. "When I woke up, I couldn't believe what happened. I thought I was dreaming. I couldn't imagine the Third Child talking like that, kissing me, and walking off with a wink like you'd suddenly turned into Kaji-junior. I don't know what I'd have done if you'd actually walked into the bathroom while I was in the shower. It might not have been pretty. I didn't know who to expect when you came back in. The Third Child I'd always known, or the one I'd just woken up next to. I just wanted to give you a little push to see how you'd react when I asked. I didn't expect it to turn into... this." She left that thought incomplete, and they sat in silence for a while. The dawn light outside slowly brightened.

她短暂地回应了他的微笑，随后扭回原来的姿势。"当我醒来时，我简直不敢相信发生了什么。我以为自己在做梦。我无法想象第三适格者会那样说话，吻我，然后眨眼离开，仿佛你突然变成了小加持。如果你真的在我洗澡时走进浴室，我真不知道自己会做出什么来。那场面可能不会太好看。你再次进来时，我不知道该期待哪个你——是我一直认识的第三适格者，还是刚与我同床共枕的那个人。我只是想稍微试探一下，看看当我提问时你会如何反应。我没想到会演变成……这样。"她没有把话说完，两人沉默地坐了一会儿。窗外的曙光渐渐明亮起来。

"Shinji..." she began much more cautiously, "...this... isn't going to be easy. I know...I can be hard to live with. And you… we've both got... a lot of problems."

"真嗣……" 她开始更加谨慎地说道，"……这……不会容易。我知道……我可能很难相处。而你……我们俩都有……很多问题。"

She looked at him in surprise as he started to laugh quietly. "Asuka, both of our parents practically dumped us by the side of the road before we were four. Both of us have actually died in combat with alien monsters before we were fifteen. We outlived the end of the world, and then some. Why should anything in our lives be easy, even the good things?"

他开始轻声笑起来，她惊讶地看着他。"明日香，我们俩的父母几乎在我们四岁前就把我们丢弃在路边。我们俩在十五岁之前都曾在与外星怪物的战斗中死去。我们不仅活过了世界末日，还活得更久。为什么我们生活中的任何事情，哪怕是好事，都应该是容易的呢？"

"And this is a good thing?" she asked as she squeezed his arms around her again.

"而且这是件好事吗？" 她问道，再次紧紧地抱住他的双臂。

"The best, Asuka. The best in the world."

最好的，明日香。世界最佳。

Neither one felt much like moving for quite some time. After Shinji's stomach began to rumble, Asuka did briefly lean forward enough to drag the breakfast tray back within reach, and they finished their breakfast still leaning against each other. Even after all the food had been finished, they were both reluctant to move, lest the spell that had somehow let them get there be broken. But eventually the demands of Asuka's drying hair and Shinji's bladder won out, and they rose from the bed.

两人很长一段时间都不愿动弹。直到真嗣的肚子开始咕噜作响，明日香才短暂地向前倾身，将早餐托盘拖回伸手可及之处，他们就这样依偎着吃完了早餐。即便食物已尽，他们仍不愿分开，生怕打破那不知何故让他们走到一起的魔咒。但最终，明日香干枯的头发和真嗣的膀胱需求占了上风，他们才从床上起身。

Asuka was finishing brushing out her hair in the bathroom when Shinji returned with the flat wooden box he'd been holding yesterday when she'd walked in on his video call with 'Commander Ikari'. She shot him a questioning look.

明日香正在浴室梳理完头发，这时真嗣带着昨天她无意中撞见他与“碇司令”视频通话时手里拿着的那个扁平木盒回来了。她向他投去一个询问的眼神。

He handed her the box with a small smile. "Turns out, there is an HMS Shinji Ikari. Right before you came in during that call yesterday, she sent me this."

他带着一丝微笑递给她一个盒子。“结果还真有一艘名为 HMS 碇真嗣的船。就在你昨天进来接电话之前，她把这个寄给了我。”

Asuka rolled her eyes at the fearsome expression on the Third Child on the cover emblem. "That's a look I haven't seen on you much." She wrestled with her rusty knowledge of kanji to read the motto on the bottom of the emblem. "'Here I Stand And Here I Remain'?" She snorted. "Appropriate for you."

明日香对着封面徽章上第三适格者那可怕的表情翻了个白眼。“这种表情在你脸上可不多见。”她费力地调动起生锈的汉字知识，试图读出徽章底部的格言。“‘我站在此，我留在此’？”她嗤笑一声。“对你来说倒是挺合适的。”

"Take a look inside. Our analogues' daughter sent that to give me hope and confidence in the future."

看看里面吧。我们同类的女儿寄来这个，是为了给我未来的希望和信心。

Asuka opened the box and stared at the picture inside. "I don't think I've ever smiled like that in my life," she said after a long, silent look.

明日香打开盒子，凝视着里面的照片。“我觉得我这辈子都没那样笑过，”她沉默良久后说道。

"You have," Shinji said. She looked at him with an expression of mild disbelief on her face. "Yesterday, on the beach. It was so amazing, I didn't know what to say. I almost..." He looked away and rubbed the back of his head, blushing. "I almost reached out to hold you right then. You looked so hurt when that smile faded."

"你确实有," 真嗣说道。她带着一丝难以置信的表情看着他。"昨天，在海滩上。那场景太震撼了，我不知该说什么好。我差点……" 他转过头，揉了揉后脑勺，脸颊泛红。"我差点就伸出手去抱你了。当那笑容消失时，你看起来那么受伤。"

Asuka expression shifted to a narrow-eyed glare reminiscent of ones she used to give him in school. "Let that be a lesson to you, Third; you see me feeling like that again, you are now under orders to hold me and make me feel better. Got it?"

明日香的表情转为眯眼怒视，这眼神让她想起了在学校时她常给他的那种。“让这成为你的教训，第三；如果你再看到我那样，你现在被命令要抱住我，让我感觉好些。明白了吗？”

"Zu Befehl, L-liebling." Shinji stuttered, reddening further.

"遵命，亲爱的。" 真嗣结巴着说道，脸更红了。

"Gut." Asuka looked back down at the picture, blinked, and snapped her head back up. "Wait, since when do you know German?"

"好。" 明日香低头看了看照片，眨了眨眼，然后猛地抬头。"等等，你什么时候学会德语的？"

"Um... since yesterday. A-after you said... what you said in the dojo, I called her to ask for advice. She transported me to... um, 'my' ship, and one of her kids gave me a crash course in German and a few other things, plus some family stories about how 'their' you and me got together."

呃...从昨天开始。在你说了...在道场说的那些话之后，我打电话向她求教。她把我传送到了...嗯，“我的”飞船上，她的一个孩子给我恶补了德语和一些其他知识，还讲了一些关于“他们的”你和我如何走到一起的家庭故事。

"Hmm, clever, Thir-...Shinji. Still full of surprises, you are. A NILS course?"

嗯，聪明，Thir-...真嗣。你总是充满惊喜。NILS 课程吗？

"Yeah. How did you know?"

是啊，你怎么知道的？

"How do you think I learned how to fly my new toy so fast? Yes, I am a naturally expert genius, but I still need more than a few hours to get that good that fast," she said, and looked back down at the note inside the front cover. "Flurgen kanji. I'll need to get a course in Japanese so I never have to worry about kanji again. What's the note say?"

你以为我怎么这么快就学会操控我的新玩具了？没错，我天生就是个专家级天才，但即便如此，要达到这种熟练程度，几个小时还是远远不够的，”她说着，目光又落回到封面内侧的便条上。“弗鲁根汉字。看来我得去学个日语课程，这样以后就再也不必为汉字烦恼了。这便条上写的是什么？”

"'Family is always with you. You get what you give, so give it all. And don't forget to push back! -Love, the Sohryu-Ikari family PS: You have to send us yours in 30 years!'" Shinji blushed again at the last part. "The 'push back' part is what made me think to call her, after you said that."

"家人永远与你同在。你付出什么，就会收获什么，所以全力以赴吧。别忘了要反抗！——爱你的，碇真嗣-碇唯家族 附言：三十年后你也要寄给我们哦！" 看到最后一句，真嗣再次脸红。"正是那句'反抗'让我决定给她打电话，你说了之后我就想到了。"

"Good... wait, she sent this before I went swimming. I didn't say that until hours later. Huh?"

好的...等等，她是在我去游泳之前发的这条消息。我几个小时后才说的那句话。嗯？

"Yeah, that was kind of weird. I guess their Asuka said something like that too."

是啊，那有点奇怪。我猜他们的明日香也说了类似的话。

Asuka shook her head. "This place gets weirder every time I turn around. Witch Queens, people with wings, people back from the dead, at least three copies of us running around, and a bartender that looked like a dragon. I'd ask 'what's next?', but I bet that would count as tempting fate around here."

明日香摇了摇头。“这个地方每次我转身都变得更诡异。巫后、长翅膀的人、死而复生的人、至少三个我们的复制品四处游荡，还有一个长得像龙的酒保。我想问‘接下来是什么？’，但在这里，我敢打赌这算是挑衅命运。”

"What is next? I mean, yesterday was pretty wild, but what are we doing today?" Shinji asked.

接下来要做什么？我是说，昨天已经够疯狂了，那我们今天干什么？” 真嗣问道。

"I don't know what we're doing today, but for now you are getting a shower. I don't care how good you smell, you still need to be clean before we go out for anything," Asuka insisted. "I'm getting dressed."

“我不知道我们今天有什么安排，但现在你得去洗个澡。不管你闻起来有多香，出门前你还是得保持干净，”明日香坚持道，“我要去换衣服了。”

Shinji nodded. "Okay, I'll... wait, what did you just say?"

绫波点了点头。“好的，我……等等，你刚说什么？”

Asuka blinked at him, then reddened. "Um. Nothing," she said quietly.

明日香眨了眨眼，脸颊泛起红晕。“嗯，没什么，”她轻声说道。

Shinji had frozen two steps towards the shower stall. "You think I smell good?"

真嗣向淋浴间迈了两步便僵住了。“你觉得我闻起来香吗？”

Asuka's face started to resemble the color of her hair. "Maybe a little..." My, the floor tiles were fascinating this morning. "You did smell kind of... good. It was kind of nice waking up feeling warm and... stuff. Um. Get in the shower, Th-" Shinji's arms circling around her cut her off.

明日香的脸上开始泛起与她发色相似的红晕。“可能有一点...”天哪，今早的地砖真是迷人。“你闻起来确实...挺好的。醒来时感觉温暖又...那种感觉。嗯。快去洗澡，真——”然而，她的话被真嗣环绕过来的双臂打断了。

"That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me, Asuka. Thank you." He squeezed her for a moment, then returned to heading for the shower.

那可能是你对我说的最动听的话了，明日香。谢谢你。" 他紧握了她一会儿，然后继续向浴室走去。

It took several seconds for her to unfreeze and quickly walk into the bedroom to find clothes for the day. It was shock that held her in place as he shucked off his t-shirt and boxers and got in the shower. Not at all an interest in checking out his buns, really. Nice.

她愣了几秒才回过神来，快步走进卧室寻找当天的衣物。他脱掉 T 恤和内裤进入淋浴间时，她之所以愣住，完全是出于震惊，绝非有意欣赏他的臀部，真的，挺不错。

Finding the breakfast tray gone and the bed already made as she returned to the bedroom caused only a moment's check to her stride. She shrugged and tossed her robe on the bed before tearing into the dresser and wardrobe. She felt a different sort of nervousness selecting undergarments today than she'd had last night. The knowledge that yes, Shinji was definitely looking at her put a whole new spin on it. Knowledge that was still frightening, but in an exciting, wholly different way.

回到卧室发现早餐托盘已不见，床铺也已整理好，这仅让她步伐稍顿片刻。她耸耸肩，将睡袍扔在床上，随即翻箱倒柜地寻找衣物。今天挑选内衣时感受到的紧张与昨晚截然不同。确信无疑，真嗣正在注视着她，这让一切变得截然不同。这份认知依旧令人心悸，却带着一种全新的、令人兴奋的刺激感。

She was lingering over the more interesting end of that drawer when the ceiling pinged at her. "Apologies for the intrusion, Pilot Sohryu. You have an incoming call from Junior Flight Lieutenant of the Blue Ching-Hao Leibshott. Would you like to take it in here as audio-only?" the house system inquired.

她正沉浸在那抽屉更有趣的一端时，天花板对她发出了声响。“抱歉打扰，碇真嗣驾驶员。您有一通来自蓝清浩少尉的来电，请问您是否愿意在此仅以音频方式接听？”家居系统询问道。

"Yes, put her through, BH." She pulled on a pair of panties.

好的，让她接通，BH。" 她拉上了一条内裤。

"Good morning, Asuka," her friend's voice greeted her. "Forgot to mention last night, I'm going to be at the doc's for a medical procedure this morning, but I'll be back around lunchtime. You two going to be good for the morning without me?"

"早上好，明日香，"她朋友的声音向她问候道，"昨晚忘记说了，今天上午我要去医院做个小手术，不过午饭前就能回来。你们俩上午没我行吗？"

Asuka was very glad this was an audio-only call. She didn't even have to try to hide her grin. "Oh, I think we're going to be okay." She shrugged the bra on. The idea of watching the Thir— Shinji trying to get it off her almost made her snicker.

明日香非常庆幸这是一次只有声音的通话。她甚至不需要刻意掩饰自己的笑容。“哦，我觉得我们应该没问题。”她套上了胸罩。想象着真嗣试图帮她脱下它的场景，她差点笑出声来。

There was a long pause on the other end. "Asuka, why are you smiling?"

电话那头沉默了许久。“明日香，你为什么在笑？”

Asuka whipped her head around to look out the window. No Ching staring at her from outside. "How did...?"

明日香猛地转头望向窗外，没有程的目光从外面盯着她。“怎么会……？”

"I can hear it in your voice. You're damn near singing at me. What's the story?"

从你的声音里我听得出来，你几乎是在对我唱歌。有什么故事吗？

"Still figuring it out. I had a good morning, though. I'll tell you later."

还在摸索中。不过，我今天早上过得挺好的。晚点告诉你。

"Alright, but I demand juicy details. You sound happy about something. See you later."

好吧，但我要求听到劲爆细节。你听起来对某事感到开心。回头见。

"Later." A beep, and the connection ended. "Yeah, definitely still figuring it out." 'What did that woman say at the clinic? 'We're alive and together. We'll figure the rest out.' Yeah. I don't know what to say yet, Ching. I'm still not sure what just happened. But...I don't think that baka even knowshowto lie. He sure can't lie to me. He meant it. I can tell. Oh mein Gott, he loves me.'

"待会儿见。"一声嘟响，通话结束。"嗯，确实还在摸索中。"那位女士在诊所说的是什么来着？'我们还活着，在一起。剩下的我们会弄明白的。'是啊。我现在还不知道该说什么，Ching。我仍然不确定刚刚发生了什么。但是...我觉得那个笨蛋甚至不知道怎么撒谎。他肯定骗不了我。我能感觉到，他是认真的。哦，我的天，他爱我。'

The realization was still sinking in. Asuka was finding it harder and harder not to smile. 'He loves me. He swore he'd never abandon me, ever, no matter what. He's mine. Mine! Not Wondergirl's, not Misato's, not anyone's, justmine!'

这个认知还在逐渐沉淀。明日香发现自己越来越难以抑制笑容。'他爱我。他发誓永远不会抛弃我，无论发生什么。他是我的。我的！不是 Wondergirl 的，不是美里的，不属于任何人，只属于我！'

Hers. She couldn't wait to tell Mama. She pulled on a summery dress and headed for the back bedroom, no longer even trying to fight her smile. The door to her mother's room swung open to reveal Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu sleeping just as she had been left last night. Mother Sriyana was not sitting by the bed, as she had left when the returned last night, quietly assuring Asuka she'd be back once they called or left the house. Asuka was just as happy for this. She wanted to talk to Mama alone.

她的。她迫不及待想告诉妈妈。她穿上一条夏日连衣裙，朝后卧室走去，不再试图抑制自己的笑容。通往母亲房间的门一打开，就看到京子·齐柏林·苏尔瑞正在睡觉，就像昨晚被留下的样子。母亲斯里亚娜并没有坐在床边，正如她昨晚回来时悄悄离开的那样，她保证一旦他们打电话或离开家就会回来。明日香对此同样感到高兴。她想单独和妈妈谈谈。

She sat in the chair by the bedside and took her mother's hand. "Mama... I... the boy I told you and Mother Sriyana about yesterday... he held me. He told me I'm beautiful and kissed me." She wiped at her eyes. "He said it, Mama. He said he loves me! And I know he meant it!"

她坐在床边的椅子上，握住了母亲的手。“妈妈……我……昨天我跟您和斯里雅娜师母提到的那个男孩……他抱住了我。他说我很美，还吻了我。”她擦了擦眼睛。“他说了，妈妈。他说他爱我！我知道他是真心的！”

She paid no further attention to the tears dripping off her smile as she told her mother everything; he felt warm, he looked at her, he kept her nightmares at bay, he swore to her, he loved her, he loved her, he loved her...

她对那些从笑容中滴落的泪水不再理会，向母亲倾诉了一切；他感到温暖，他注视着她，他驱散了她的噩梦，他向她发誓，他爱她，他爱她，他爱她……

Outside, Avalon's primary, Primastra, rose. It was a bright new day.

外面，阿瓦隆的主星普里玛斯特拉升起了。这是一个明亮的新日子。

Author's Note 23OCT16: Orrrr I can get super busy at work and forget entirely. Oops. Sorry about that, everyone. Here's the promised major talk at last. Updates will resume more regularly, I hope.

作者注 2016 年 10 月 23 日：或者我可能因为工作超级忙而完全忘记了。哎呀，抱歉各位。终于带来了承诺中的重要谈话。希望更新能更规律地继续。

### Chapter 15 Philosophy & Choices

A trail of footprints stretched far behind them along the beach, in places smudged or erased by the gentle waves. Shinji enjoyed the warm water lapping over his feet as they walked almost as much as the feeling of Asuka's hand in his. He felt so light he was faintly surprised he wasn't bobbing on top of the water.

沙滩上，一串脚印远远地延伸在他们身后，有些地方被轻柔的波浪模糊或抹去。真嗣享受着温暖的海水轻拍脚面的感觉，几乎与握着明日香的手的感觉一样美好。他感到如此轻盈，以至于有些惊讶自己没有漂浮在水面上。

He'd emerged from the shower and dressed to find Asuka with a newly BH-furnished sun hat and glasses, insisting that a walk on the shore was what they should do next. Having no better idea and perfectly happy to just walk near her, they'd headed out down the beach, past Ching's cabin and onward. He'd reached out to take her hand as they passed the spot where they'd stood the previous dawn. Asuka had jumped like he'd touched her with a live wire, but smiled back and gripped his hand too. They'd walked for a good while before either of them spoke a single word.

他洗完澡穿戴整齐后，发现明日香戴着新添置的宽檐帽和墨镜，坚持认为接下来应该去海边散步。没有更好的主意，也乐意与她并肩而行，他们便沿着沙滩出发，经过秦的木屋继续前行。当他们经过前一天黎明站立的地方时，他伸出手去牵她的手。明日香像是被电流击中般跳了一下，但随即回以微笑，也紧紧握住了他的手。他们走了好一会儿，才有人打破沉默，开口说话。

"Thank you," Asuka said after a while.

"谢谢你，" 过了一会儿，明日香说道。

Shinji looked at her. "For what?"

真嗣看着她。“为什么？”

"For not giving up on me. I spent so long trying to keep everyone away. You more than most. I pushed at you harder because you...always got under my skin somehow. I gave you more than enough reasons to never want to talk to me again."

为了不放弃我。我花了很长时间试图让所有人都远离我。你尤其如此。我对你推得更狠，因为你……不知怎么总能触动我。我给了你足够多的理由，让你再也不想和我说话。

Shinji shrugged. He looked down as he tried to pick his words carefully. "After the fighting, when I mentioned worrying about false memories? That had always preyed at my mind in Boston; worrying that all the pain, all the things that drove so much silence between us might have been something that had never been real. I started getting into philosophy because of thinking like that. What if all the things we thought were such great pieces of how we acted towards each other were something that had just been put together when we came out of Instrumentality? How would we know the difference in our own heads? I always felt like something was missing. It just... didn't feel right that we would end that way. So I held myself together somehow. The philosophy helped. Just having some of the things put into words helped, like 'Go on or go under'."

真嗣耸了耸肩，低头斟酌着措辞。“战斗结束后，我提到过担心虚假记忆的事吗？在波士顿时，这念头一直困扰着我；担心那些痛苦，那些让我们之间沉默寡言的一切，可能根本就不曾真实存在过。正是这种思考让我开始涉猎哲学。如果那些我们认为塑造了我们彼此行为的重大片段，只是我们在补完计划后拼凑出来的呢？我们又如何在内心分辨真假？我总感觉缺了点什么。我们以那样的方式结束，感觉就是不对劲。所以我努力维持着自己。哲学给了我帮助。仅仅是将一些想法诉诸言语，比如‘继续前行或沉沦下去’，就已足够。”

He looked sidelong at her. "When Rei put all that power in my hands, asked me what I wanted... I'd just seen the MP Evas chewing on the shredded pieces Unit-02. I snapped, just started screaming... I don't think I was all there when I begged you to help me. But... at the end... what brought me out of it, what gave all of us the chance to come out of Instrumentality... was when I realized I could be happy. That I could choose to change things, and that I wanted to try..." He stopped and turned to face her. "And that I wanted to try with you. You saved the world, Asuka."

他斜眼看着她。"当丽将所有力量交到我手中，问我想要什么时...我刚看到那些 MP 使徒在啃食零号机二号机的碎片。我崩溃了，开始尖叫...我觉得那时我并不完全清醒，当我恳求你帮助我。但是...到最后...让我清醒过来，让我们所有人有机会脱离人类补完计划...是因为我意识到我可以快乐。我可以选择改变，我想要尝试..."他停下，转向面对她。"而且我想和你一起尝试。你拯救了世界，明日香。"

She looked at him, stunned. "What? I... how? I refused you! I threw it all back in your face, treated you as badly as anyone ever had."

她看着他，惊呆了。“什么？我……怎么可能？我拒绝了你！我把你的一切都扔回你脸上，对你像任何人一样恶劣。”

"I barely remember my mother. My father abandoned me with hardly a word. My sensei was just that and that only. Before I came to Tokyo-3, I had no one. Even there, I had only a few friends, and by accident. I didn't connect to anyone. And then you appeared. You yelled at me, called me 'baka', pushed me as a Pilot... but no matter what, you were there. You didn't just let me drift. You were always there, in my face, so... so alive, so real... before you came, I'd just retreat into my music, hide away... I'd be small. Before you came, I just... existed. You made me live. And I knew that it was possible to be happy; I'd seen others find it. So when I decided that I wanted to try, there was no one else in my life that I'd want to try it with more than you. Misato-san, Ayanami-san... I... they didn't make me live the same way you did." He squeezed her hand and smiled at her. "I saw you, when I was in the hospital after I came out of the 12th Angel. I saw the way you were listening at the door when Ayanami-san left, and jumped when she opened it. It made me laugh. I knew you cared, even if you didn't show it directly much. And that First Kiss was pretty nice. I mean, it was really, really nice. I held on as long as I could. I'd have kissed you all night if I could have held my breath that long."

我对母亲的记忆已模糊不清，父亲将我抛弃时几乎未留一言。我的师父亦仅此而已。在来到第三新东京市之前，我孑然一身。即便在那里，我的朋友也寥寥无几，且多是偶然相识。我与任何人都不曾深交。然后你出现了。你对我大声呵斥，叫我“笨蛋”，逼我成为驾驶员……但无论如何，你始终在身边。你没有任由我漂泊无依。你总是那么鲜活，那么真实，直面我的一切……在你出现之前，我只会沉溺于音乐，躲藏起来……让自己变得渺小。在你到来之前，我只是……存在着。是你让我真正活了过来。我明白了幸福是可能的；我见过他人寻得它。所以当我决定尝试追求时，我生命中没有其他人比与你一同尝试更让我渴望。美里小姐，绫波小姐……我……她们并未以你那样的方式让我活过来。”他紧握她的手，对她微笑。“我在医院里，从第十二使徒事件后醒来时见过你。我看到你在绫波小姐离开时贴门倾听的样子，以及她开门时你惊跳的反应。那让我笑了。我知道你在乎，即使你并不常直接表露。而那初吻，真的很美好。 我是说，那真的很美好。我尽力坚持了。如果我能憋气那么久，我愿意整晚都亲吻你。"

Asuka blushed and started walking again, pulling him along by his hand. "I'm... I..." She fought with what she was trying to get out. "Ahem! I'm... sorry. I... didn't... why didn't you hold me?" She looked at him out of the corner of her eye as they kept moving.

明日香脸颊泛红，重新迈开步伐，拉着他的手前行。“我……我……”她挣扎着想要表达。“咳！我……对不起。我……没……你为什么没抱我？”她边走边用眼角余光瞥向他。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"That's how kisses are supposed to go! You're supposed to hold the person you're kissing! I...I...I didn't run to the bathroom because I really had to rinse my mouth out. I ran so you wouldn't see me break down," she said in a rush. "I waited and waited for you to put your arms around me! When you didn't move, I though you didn't want me. I ran because I was about to start crying."

这才是亲吻应有的样子！你应该抱住你亲吻的人！我……我……我跑去洗手间并不是真的需要漱口。我跑是因为不想让你看到我崩溃的样子，"她急促地说道，"我等啊等，就盼着你伸手抱我！你一动不动，我还以为你不要我了。我跑是因为我快要哭出来了。"

"You were holding my nose! I..." His indignant reply abruptly ran out of steam in the face of her obvious vulnerability at making this revelation. "I... I'm sorry. You held my nose because my breathing tickled you. It felt so good to kiss you, I was afraid of doing anything else that might make you stop, so I froze. I wanted it to go on as long as I could. I didn't know. If I had, I'd have held you..." He smiled again. "...tighter than this morning, even. I..." A thought struck him. "Wait, is this what you told yourself in the tent that made you scream?"

你刚才捏着我的鼻子！我……"他愤愤不平的回答在面对她揭露真相时的明显脆弱时戛然而止。"我……对不起。我捏你鼻子是因为你的呼吸让我发痒。亲吻你感觉太美妙了，我害怕做其他任何事会让你停止，所以我僵住了。我希望它能持续得越久越好。我不知道。如果我知道，我会抱住你……"他又笑了。"……比早上还要紧。我……"一个念头闪过他的脑海。"等等，这就是你在帐篷里告诉自己然后尖叫的原因吗？"

She looked at him. "Ah... yeah, it was. I... er, she used the fact I broke down in the bathroom, alone, when no one else could have known as a way to prove she was 'me'. When I... um... worried that you'd heard her mention that, she said that 'I' told you later... which would be now, I guess. But at the time I was just shocked at the idea I'd ever tell you... that I wanted you to... hold me." She shook her head. "Wow. And two days later, here we are. Wow... I even told myself it was going to happen, and I still couldn't believe it."

她看着他。"啊...是的，确实如此。我...呃，她利用我在浴室独自崩溃的事实，那时没人能知道，以此证明她就是'我'。当我...嗯...担心你听她提起过这事时，她说'我'后来告诉了你...也就是现在，我想。但当时我一想到自己会告诉你...希望你...抱住我，我就震惊不已。"她摇了摇头。"哇。两天后，我们竟然在这里。哇...我甚至预感到了会发生，却还是难以置信。"

Shinji gave her a sad smile. "Yeah, that's what 'I' said about it, that it was 'the kind of thing I wish I'd known' back then that could have let me help you. 'I' was right. If I'd known..." He snorted softly. "Back during the dinner last night, when Daniel pulled me away for a few minutes? He was pointing out a few critical gaps in my education, and that you were a genius who sometimes forgot that I wasn't one too. Sensei never covered the Bible much. I didn't know anything about the 'Walls of Jericho'. I thought it meant what you said, that they were impenetrable. I wish I was as smart as you, Asuka. If I'd known..." His free hand rubbed at the back of his head. "Well, I might still have chickened out, but...I'm sure I would have been awake all night trying to get the nerve to knock on your door. I wouldn't have been able to believe that someone as hot as you wanted me to come in. I still wish I was smarter. I'm sorry I missed it."

真嗣向她露出了一个悲伤的微笑。“是啊，那就是‘我’对此的看法，说那是‘我希望当时就知道’的事情，那样我就能帮到你了。‘我’是对的。如果我那时知道……”他轻声嗤笑。“昨晚晚餐时，丹尼尔拉我出去几分钟那会儿？他指出了我教育中的几个关键漏洞，还说你是天才，有时会忘记我并非如此。老师从没怎么讲过《圣经》。我对‘耶利哥之墙’一无所知。我以为它就是你说的那样，坚不可摧。真希望我能像你一样聪明，明日香。如果我那时知道……”他空着的那只手摩挲着后脑勺。“嗯，我可能还是会临阵退缩，但……我确信我会整夜辗转反侧，鼓起勇气敲你的门。我不敢相信像你这样火辣的人会希望我进去。我仍然希望自己能更聪明些。很抱歉我错过了。”

"See, Third Child? That's what you get for not being a genius like me; you miss out on chances to get the hottest, smartest, best Pilot in Tokyo-3 into your arms!" Asuka preened for a moment. Then her smile dropped a bit. "It... hurt when you didn't. I had no idea you didn't know that story. Everybody in a university in Germany knows enough of the Bible for that. I thought you'd get it. I waited for almost an hour for you to knock. I... had a bad night when I finally fell asleep. If I'd known how much holding you kept nightmares away, I'd have opened the door myself!" She squeezed his hand back.

看，第三适格者？这就是你不如我这样的天才的后果；你错过了把东京-3 最炙手可热、最聪明、最优秀的驾驶员拥入怀中的机会！”明日香得意了一会儿。随后她的笑容稍稍收敛。“你没来，我心里挺难受的。我没想到你不知道那个故事。德国大学里的每个人对圣经都略知一二。我以为你会明白。我等了你将近一个小时，等你敲门。我……最后睡着的那晚过得很糟糕。如果我知道抱着你能驱散噩梦，我早就自己开门了！”她紧握着他的手回应。

"I know," Shinji replied. Asuka made a questioning noise. "You got up to go to the bathroom, and sleepwalked back to my futon. I... um... remember after the 7th Angel, when you accused me of trying to kiss you in your sleep, and I said I thought you were asleep?" She gave him a mild glare, but nodded. "That was it. You came out of the bathroom and flopped onto my futon. Must have been since that room was where we'd been sleeping all week doing the synch training. But you looked absolutely gorgeous in the moonlight, and you were so close... I did try to kiss you. But..."

"我知道，" 真嗣回答道。明日香发出了一声疑问的哼声。"你去上厕所，然后梦游回到了我的被褥上。我...呃...记得第七使徒事件后，你指责我在你睡着时试图吻你，我说我以为你睡着了？" 她给了他一个温和的瞪视，但点了点头。"就是那样。你从浴室出来，直接倒在了我的被褥上。可能是因为那个房间是我们整个星期进行同步训练时一直睡觉的地方。但你在月光下看起来美极了，而且你离我那么近...我真的试图吻你。但是..."

"Pervert. I knew it. But what?"

变态。我就知道。但究竟是什么呢？

"...you were crying. And you called for... for your Mama. I... couldn't . I picked up my pillow and blanket and moved to the other side of the room for the night."

"...你在哭泣，呼唤着...呼唤着你的妈妈。我...无能为力。我拿起枕头和毯子，移到了房间的另一侧过夜。"

Asuka walked silently next to him for a bit. "Baka. You should have held me." She poked his shoulder with her free hand. "You've got orders now, remember!"

明日香默默地走在他身边一会儿。“笨蛋。你应该抱住我的。”她用空着的手戳了戳他的肩膀。“你现在有命令了，记住！”

"Au! Jawohl, L-liebling," he smiled. 'Maybe one day I'll be able to say that without stuttering in embarrassment. Eh, I've only been saying it out loud for an hour. Practice, practice, practice.'

"哎呀！好的，亲爱的，"他微笑着说，'也许有一天我能毫不结巴、毫不尴尬地说出这句话。唉，我才大声练习了一个小时。练习，练习，练习。'

"And don't you forget it!" She brightened. "Hey, that's right, you know German now! We can finally speak properly! Only German for the rest of today! You need to practice your tiny non-genius brain, baka-Shinji!"

"你可别忘了！"她眼前一亮，"嘿，对啊，你现在会德语了！我们终于能好好交流了！今天剩下的时间只说德语！你那点儿不聪明的小脑瓜得好好练练，笨蛋真嗣！"

"Wie du wünschst, Asuka."

如你所愿，明日香。

The coast of their island's shore curved around and brought them back towards their own cabin's end. They'd sighted a few other cabins along the way, but saw no other people or signs of activity until they reached a point near the next cabin up the island from Ching's. Under a wide sunshade two beach chairs were occupied by figures that grew more familiar, but puzzling as they walked closer.

他们岛屿的海岸线蜿蜒曲折，引领他们返回自己的小屋尽头。沿途他们瞥见了其他几间小屋，但直到接近 Ching 家上方岛上的下一间小屋时，才看到其他人和活动的迹象。在宽阔的遮阳伞下，两把沙滩椅上坐着的人影随着他们走近而愈发熟悉，却也愈发令人困惑。

Asuka tilted her head and tried to reconcile what she was seeing with what she knew. The blonde hair and red beard were the same, but it was still hard to believe that the man in the first chair with the aviator sunglasses, white and red short-sleeved tropical shirt, and ratty shorts was their usually armored and caped host. Just as normal yet thereby odd was the Witch Queen next to him, now in a colorful sarong and backless swimsuit.

明日香歪着头，试图将眼前所见与她所知的一切相调和。金发与红须依旧，但很难相信那位戴着飞行员墨镜、身穿白红相间的短袖热带衬衫、搭配破旧短裤坐在第一把椅子上的男子，竟是平日里身披盔甲、披风飘扬的主人。同样寻常却又因此显得古怪的是他身旁的巫后，此刻她身着色彩斑斓的莎笼，搭配着露背泳装。

Daniel raised a coconut and paper umbrella drink at them as they drew near. "G'day, howdy-do, and hiya, kids. Having a good morning?" He nodded at their still joined hands. "Or are you still sort of feeling your way into things?" he asked in jaunty Japanese.

当他们走近时，丹尼尔举起了一杯椰子和纸伞饮料向他们打招呼：“早上好，你们好，嗨，孩子们。早上过得愉快吗？”他点头示意他们依旧牵着的手。“还是说，你们还在摸索着适应彼此呢？”他用轻快的日语问道。

Asuka fought down the sudden embarrassed urge to jerk her hand away from Shinji and protest that it wasn't what they thought, an impulse made only stronger by the fact that it really was. 'No, damn it! He's mine!' She couldn't prevent the flush that ran up her neck and face, though. "Um... yes," she quietly answered in German.

明日香努力抑制住突然涌起的尴尬冲动，想要抽回被真嗣握着的手并抗议说事情并非他们所想的那样，而这一冲动因事实确实如此而愈发强烈。'不，该死！他是我的！'尽管如此，她还是无法阻止那股红晕从脖子蔓延至脸颊。"嗯...是的，"她用德语轻声回答。

"No surprise you'd give us the Mathematician's Answer, Asuka," Rayana observed as she sat up. She'd smoothly switched to German. "Take your time. It took me months, back when."

"难怪你会给我们那个数学家的答案，明日香。" 雷亚娜坐起身来，流畅地切换到了德语。"慢慢来，我当初也花了好几个月。"

Daniel chuckled. "Not me. I saw her, I fell. Game Over, I surrendered. It did take me a few years to convince her to say 'Yes' to a certain question, though." His smile faded and his face grew serious. "We've got a lot of important things to cover soon, Shinji, Asuka. I've got some good news for you too, but we need to talk about some things before we can get to that. Please have a seat."

丹尼尔轻笑一声：“不是我。我一见到她，就沦陷了。游戏结束，我投降了。不过，确实花了几年时间才让她对某个问题说出‘愿意’。”他的笑容渐渐消失，神情变得严肃起来。“我们很快有很多重要的事情要讨论，真嗣，明日香。我也有好消息要告诉你们，但在那之前，我们得先谈谈一些事情。请坐吧。”

Asuka could feel Shinji stiffen through their mutual grip. A quiet, unsettled feeling went through her too as they broke their handclasp for the first time in most of an hour to take a couple of the empty chairs under the shade. The feeling got a little stronger as she watched the brighter, happy look on his face fade back into something far more familiar, his usual blank, withdrawn expression.

明日香能感觉到真嗣在他们紧握的手中变得僵硬。当他们第一次在一个多小时后松开手，坐到树荫下的几把空椅子上时，一种不安的静默感也掠过她的心头。她看着他脸上原本明亮、快乐的表情逐渐消退，变回了他那熟悉的、空洞而退缩的神情，这种感觉变得更加强烈。

"Talk about what?" Shinji finally asked after they'd sat in silence for a minute.

"说什么呢？" 终于，在沉默了一分钟后，真嗣开口问道。

Daniel put his coconut down on the sand and moved his sunglasses to the top of his head to look Shinji right in the eye. "''The time has come', the walrus said, to talk of many things'," he quoted. "Of wars and ships, and people whacked, of casualties and kings-of-the-mountain. We need to talk about your world, the campaign for South America you were about to embark on before I arrived, and how that will go. But that discussion itself must be prefaced by more general ones about how much you two want to be involved in that, and more importantly, what you are prepared to do and to risk towards that end." He gestured at the beach in general. "This is a nice place, a place to rest and recover. You two have more than paid your dues in terms of personal pain, sacrifice, and saving your world. The Imperial Army can more than handle the pacification of South America without you having to be involved at all, if you want. You do not have to fight anymore if you don't want to. I want to at the very least give you two the option you never had at the beginning, to volunteer or not. You can say no; free will and free choice is meaningless if there are no truly viable alternatives to choose from. The 'choice' your father gave you when he summoned you back, for example, Shinji. So first question is: do you want to be a part of this at all?" He stopped and looked the question at them both.

丹尼尔将椰子放在沙滩上，把太阳镜推到头顶，直视进真嗣的眼睛。“‘时辰已到’，海象说道，‘来谈谈诸多事宜’，”他引述道，“谈及战争与舰船，被击倒的人们，伤亡与山巅之王。我们需要谈谈你的世界，在我到来之前你即将启程的南美战役，以及那将如何展开。但这场讨论本身必须以前提更为广泛的议题开始，关于你们两人究竟有多想参与其中，更重要的是，你们为此准备做什么，愿意冒怎样的风险。”他向海滩挥了挥手，“这是个好地方，一个休憩与恢复之所。你们在个人痛苦、牺牲以及拯救世界方面已付出太多。帝国军队完全有能力在不需你们介入的情况下平定南美，如果你们愿意。如果你们不想，就不必再战斗。我希望至少给予你们最初未曾拥有的选择权，自愿与否。你们可以说不；若无真正可行的替代方案，自由意志与自由选择便毫无意义。” 例如，真嗣，你父亲召你回来时给你的所谓“选择”。那么第一个问题是：你到底想不想参与这一切？”他停下来，将这个问题同时抛给了他们两人。

Asuka opened her mouth to voice an immediate and firm 'yes', but stopped herself before a sound could emerge as she saw Shinji blanch out of the corner of her eye. She was suddenly torn between the urge to bop the Third Child over the head and demand he follow through on his vow to have her back, no matter what, to help her complete her almost vanished hope for one more chance at glory and validation in battle, and the novel impulse to actually take Shinji's hatred of war and killing into consideration. 'Damn it, Shinji, this was simpler when you were just the annoying Third Child.'

明日香本想立刻坚决地回答“是”，但瞥见真嗣脸色发白时，她硬生生止住了即将出口的声音。她突然陷入两难：一方面想敲打这位第三适格者的脑袋，要求他遵守承诺，无论发生什么都要支持她，帮助她实现那几乎消逝的、再次在战斗中获得荣耀与认可的希望；另一方面，她又罕见地想要考虑真嗣对战争和杀戮的厌恶。“该死，真嗣，你只是那个烦人的第三适格者时，事情简单多了。”

"I... don't know," Shinji said. "I don't like fighting. I like killing even less."

"我...不知道，" 真嗣说，"我不喜欢战斗，更讨厌杀人。"

"I know. I saw your fight during the coup, and how Asuka had to drag you into the fight, and how much you wanted to avoid innocents getting caught in the conflict. But something in that also worries me a great deal," Daniel replied. "I dislike having to hammer you on this, Shinji, but I'd have thought someone who's devoted serious time to study of philosophy would have a better appreciation for the implications of his choices."

我知道。我目睹了你在政变中的战斗，以及明日香是如何把你拖入战斗的，还有你多么希望避免无辜者卷入冲突。但这一点也让我非常担忧，”丹尼尔回答道。“我不愿就此对你严加指责，真嗣，但我本以为一个花了大量时间研究哲学的人，会对自己的选择所蕴含的深意有更深的理解。”

"What do you mean?" Shinji asked.

"你什么意思？" 真嗣问道。

"I am, and always have been, a soldier. A fighter. And yes, a killer. I long ago made peace with the fact that what I do will cause death and destruction, and that will sometimes spill over on those perhaps innocent. I became the greatest killer in the omniverse so that in the end I wouldn't have to at all because opposing me would be futile. I take every possible measure to minimize innocent suffering. But choosing inaction is a moral choice too, Shinji. I find myself in agreement with Asuka here, though she made the same point much less delicately in that battle; 'You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs', she said. Even when she pointed out to you that by refusing to fight the other MP Evas in Berlin you'd be condemning far more innocents to death under Winthrop's rule than the fighting in the city could possibly cause, it wasn't that logical conclusion that got you, if not to take up the fight yourself, to at least stop preventing her from taking action. What got you to stop holding her back was her reminding you of the choice you'd made to stop her from killing herself earlier that night, and her pointing out that stopping her from dying then would be meaningless if you got the both of you killed in the name of not getting blood on your hands. Wanting to avoid innocent blood being shed is a noble thing, Shinji, but you were choosing to avoid personal responsibility for such to the extent that you didn't seem to care if your choice would cause more people to suffer or die because of that."

我一直是，也将永远是，一名战士。一个斗士。没错，还是一个杀手。我早已接受了这个事实：我所做的一切将导致死亡与毁灭，有时甚至会波及到那些或许无辜的人。我成为了全宇宙最伟大的杀手，这样最终我就不必再杀戮，因为与我对抗将是徒劳的。我尽一切可能减少无辜者的苦难。但选择不作为也是一种道德抉择，真嗣。我发现自己在这里与明日香意见一致，尽管她在那场战斗中表达得更为直接；她说：“不打破鸡蛋就做不成煎蛋卷”。即使当她向你指出，在柏林拒绝与其它 MP 使徒战斗，你将使更多的无辜者在温斯洛普的统治下丧生，这比城市中的战斗可能造成的伤亡还要多，让你动摇的并非那个逻辑结论，而是至少不再阻止她采取行动。 让你放手的原因，是她提醒你那晚早些时候你做出的选择——阻止她自杀，以及她指出，如果为了不沾染血迹而让你俩丧命，那么阻止她死亡的行为将变得毫无意义。避免无辜者的鲜血流淌固然高尚，真嗣，但你逃避个人责任的程度，似乎已不在乎你的选择是否会导致更多人因此受苦或死亡。"

Asuka winced as Shinji seemed to shrink into himself as Daniel relentlessly pounded the point home. It was almost as painful to watch as it had been when she had done it to him herself by accident at times. She found herself split again, wanting to say something in his defense, and yet still in full agreement with what Daniel was saying. Shinji had been ready to let Winthrop crush the coup rather than fight in Berlin's urban center. "At least that'll be on Winthrop's conscience rather than mine," he'd said at the time. She'd almost punched him. His precious conscience was worth how many lives?

明日香皱眉看着真嗣似乎在丹尼尔毫不留情的指责下缩成一团。这场景几乎和她自己无意中对他做过的一样令人心痛。她感到内心再次分裂，既想为他说话，又完全同意丹尼尔的观点。真嗣曾准备让温斯洛镇压政变，而不是在柏林市中心战斗。“至少那会是温斯洛的良心负担，而不是我的，”他当时这么说。她差点就给了他一拳。他那宝贵的良心，值多少条人命？

Rayana noticed her conflict. "It speaks well to the strength of his feeling for you, Asuka, that even with his aversion to killing, there's still one thing, one person he's still willing to put that aside for; you."

蕾安娜察觉到了她的矛盾。“这充分说明了他对你的感情之深，明日香，即便他厌恶杀戮，仍有一件事，一个人，他愿意为此放下那份厌恶；那就是你。”

Asuka didn't know exactly how to take this. She'd been training to fight as an Eva Pilot since before she was four years old. She had never spared much time on worrying about the ethical niceties of fighting the Angels. And she felt even fewer qualms about fighting and killing Winthrop's thuggish Guard Regiments and other forces; killing brutes like them had been a pleasure and a privilege. Still... 'The thing he hates more than anything, killing... and he's willing to kill for you. Are you worth that, bitch?' the fear still argued. She shook that thought off, fighting back with anger again. 'Yes. If I'm not yet, then I will be. And if he's not willing to kill, then let me take that role. I'm willing and able. He's bled for me? I can bleed for him.' Decision firming within her, Asuka spoke up. "He doesn't have to. I can. He's not a killer? Fine. I am. If there's killing that needs to be done, I'll do it."

明日香不知该如何理解这一切。她从四岁前就开始训练，以成为一名 Eva 驾驶员。她从未过多考虑过与天使战斗的伦理细节。而对于与温斯洛的暴徒卫队和其他势力战斗并杀死他们，她更是毫无顾忌；杀死这些恶徒既是乐趣也是特权。尽管如此……‘他最痛恨的事情，莫过于杀戮……而他却愿意为你而杀。你配得上这份牺牲吗，贱人？’恐惧仍在内心争辩。她甩开这个念头，再次以愤怒反击。‘是的。如果我现在还不够格，那我将来一定会。如果他不愿杀人，那就让我来承担这个角色。我愿意并且能够。他为我流过血？我也能为他流血。’决心在心中坚定，明日香开口说道：“他不必这么做。我可以。他不是杀手？没关系，我是。如果有杀戮需要执行，我来承担。”

Shinji looked at her a mix of relief, shame, and protest. "Asuka? No! You... you don't need to..."

真嗣看着她，眼神中交织着宽慰、羞愧与抗议。“明日香？不！你……你不用……”

"It's alright, Shinji. It's good to see that you care enough about him to want to shield him from harm, Asuka, but it may not be necessary. We can structure the force for your world with a host of non-lethal weapons and gear, and we're fine with the challenge of aiming for a true 'Nobody Dies' scenario in South America." Daniel's lips quirked in a small smile at this. "And there's the pure 'shock & awe' value a sky full of 80 meter tall mecha can have on some wanna-be generalissimo who might have half a dozen tanks at his disposal when we call for his surrender. I'll get into the details of that this afternoon, but I raised the point of Shinji's predilection for choosing not to fight even if it might do more harm in the long run for a more specific reason. Shinji, when did things really start to turn for the worse in the Angel War? What one event more than anything else started the downward spiral that led to Ayanami's death, Asuka's coma, and your spiritual breakdown after the last Angel?"

没事的，真嗣。看到你如此关心他，想要保护他免受伤害，明日香，这很好，但或许并不必要。我们可以为你的世界构建一套配备大量非致命武器和装备的力量，我们乐于接受在南美洲实现真正“无人死亡”场景的挑战。”丹尼尔说到这里，嘴角勾起一丝微笑。“而且，当我们在要求某个自命不凡的独裁者投降时，满天 80 米高的机甲所带来的纯粹‘震撼与威慑’价值，对于那些可能只拥有半打坦克的妄想将军来说，无疑是巨大的。今天下午我会详细讨论这一点，但我提出真嗣倾向于选择不战斗，即使这可能在长远看来会造成更多伤害，是有更具体原因的。真嗣，天使战争中情况真正开始恶化是在什么时候？是哪一事件，比其他任何事件都更导致了事态的恶化，最终导致了绫波的死亡、明日香的昏迷以及你在最后一战后的精神崩溃？

Shinji was nearly curled in around himself at this point. He didn't even look up from staring at his lap to answer. "I know what you're getting at. It was the 13th Angel. When father ordered them to activate the Dummy Plug, and I had to feel Eva Unit-01 tear Unit-03 apart with my hands... when father nearly made me kill my friend with my own hands."

此时的真嗣几乎蜷缩成一团。他甚至没有抬头，只是盯着膝盖回答道：“我知道你想说什么。那是第 13 使徒。当父亲命令他们启动 Dummy Plug 时，我不得不感受着 Eva 初号机亲手撕裂三号机的痛苦……那一刻，父亲几乎让我亲手杀死了我的朋友。”

Daniel nodded. "That's when things started to go to Hell. And your father had to order the Dummy Plug into use because the Angel had already wiped out Units 00 and 02, and Unit-01 was the only thing between the Angel and NERV HQ. You may not have known then, but you know now what an Angel making it into Terminal Dogma would have meant; a Third Impact even worse than the one you lived through. Humanity wiped out. You can blame your father for the cruelty that he handled you with, Shinji, but you've got to admit the necessity of what he did. If not for the Dummy Plug, your refusal to fight back because your friend might be hurt could have doomed him, you, and everyone to die anyway, so that your hands would be clean. 'When you choose an action, you also choose the consequences of that action', another reluctant warrior once said. You've got to be aware of the consequences of your choices beyond your immediate moral dilemmas. Choosing not to fight is not always the moral choice."

丹尼尔点了点头。"那就是事情开始变得糟糕的时候。你的父亲不得不下令启用傀儡插件，因为使徒已经摧毁了 00 和 02 号机，而 01 号机是使徒与 NERV 总部之间的唯一屏障。那时你可能不知道，但现在你知道了，如果使徒进入终端教条区，将会意味着什么；一场比你所经历的还要糟糕的第三次冲击。人类将被毁灭。你可以责怪你父亲对你采取的残酷手段，真嗣，但你得承认他所做的是必要的。如果不是傀儡插件，你因为担心朋友受伤而拒绝反击，可能会导致他、你以及所有人丧生，只为了让你的双手保持干净。'当你选择一个行动时，你也选择了那个行动的后果'，另一位不情愿的战士曾这样说过。你必须意识到你的选择所带来的后果，超越你眼前的道德困境。选择不战斗并不总是道德的选择。"

Shinji face was a mask of anguish. "Touji was my friend! I couldn't..."

真嗣的脸上满是痛苦。“东治是我的朋友！我做不到……”

Asuka growled at herself internally. 'And if I hadn't been so chicken about telling the Third Touji was the Fourth after I found out, I wouldn't have been distracted when the Angel hit me and gotten knocked out so embarrassingly fast. I would have enjoyed having Kaji with us the night before a Hell of a lot more without that on my mind, too.'

明日香内心对自己咆哮着。'如果我不是那么胆小，在我发现后立刻告诉第三适格者冬二是第四适格者，我就不会在天使攻击我时走神，也不会那么丢人地迅速被击倒。我也能更享受前一晚与加持先生在一起的时光，而不必为此心事重重。'

Daniel raised a hand in a calming gesture. "Easy, Shinji. You were set up for failure by nearly everyone around you. Anyone in NERV or Touji himself could have at least told you he was the Fourth Child. That alone would have lessened the shock. And whatever his strengths as a schemer and political maneuverer, your father was shit as a tactical commander. There's a reason he had Major Katsuragi as the Operations Commander. Sending you in one by one was the last thing he should have done. Asuka was your best close-quarters fighter, Ayanami a sniper...you should have all been in one coordinated attack. You could have overwhelmed the Angel all at once, disabled it, and saved Touji without it costing him a leg, and you your confidence to continue as a Pilot. And even alone, you should have been better trained and had ways to disable the Angel without ripping it apart the way the Dummy Plug did. I just wanted you to go over that fight again and ask yourself if you would have done anything differently."

丹尼尔举起一只手，做出安抚的手势。“冷静点，真嗣。你几乎被周围所有人设局陷入了失败的境地。无论是 NERV 内部的人还是东治本人，至少都应该告诉你他就是第四适格者。仅这一点就能减轻你的震惊。至于你父亲，尽管他在策划和政治手腕上颇有能耐，但作为战术指挥官却糟糕透顶。这就是为什么他有葛城少校担任作战指挥官的原因。让你们一个个上阵是他最不该做的决定。明日香是你最佳的近战战士，绫波是狙击手……你们本应协同作战。你们本可以一举压倒使徒，使其瘫痪，救下东治而不至于让他失去一条腿，也不至于让你失去继续作为驾驶员的信心。即使单独行动，你也应该接受更好的训练，有办法在不破坏使徒的情况下使其失能，就像 Dummy Plug 所做的那样。我只是想让你重新审视那场战斗，问问自己是否会有不同的做法。”

Shinji's eyes were pinched tightly shut. "I go over that battle in my head at least once a week. I've gone over it about a thousand times since that day. I know, I ran away. I ran away from responsibility in that fight, and I ran away again right afterward. I left Asuka and Rei to face the next angel alone in the name of anger at my father and petty vanity in my own decision never to Pilot an Eva again. Unit-02's head landed right on the shelter I was in! You think there's a week that goes by I don't see all the people who were crushed right in front of me? Or wish I hadn't let my father use my hands to rip my friend apart?! I..." He stopped in shock and looked down at his left hand in shock.

真嗣的双眼紧紧闭合。“我每周至少会在脑海中重温那场战斗一次。自那天起，我已反复回想了大约千遍。我知道，我逃了。在那场战斗中，我逃避了责任，之后又再次逃离。我让明日香和绫波丽独自面对下一个使徒，只因我对父亲的愤怒和对自己不再驾驶 EVA 决定的狭隘自尊。二号机的头部正好砸在我藏身的避难所上！你以为有哪一周我能不看到那些在我面前被压碎的人们吗？或者希望我没有让父亲利用我的双手撕裂我的朋友？！我……”他震惊地停下，低头看着自己的左手，满脸惊愕。

The hand that Asuka's now rested on top of.

此刻，明日香的手正搭在上面。

"But you realized your mistake just in time, thanks to a bit of good advice from Ryoji Kaji. Good thing you were at that shelter," Daniel pointed out. "You got back in time to avert total disaster. You found the will to fight. Although I'm sure Asuka would have appreciated if you'd been there with her for a combined attack. The two of you together would have been able to take Zeruel, I think, especially with Ayanami-san as a booster."

但你及时意识到了错误，多亏了加持良治的一点好建议。好在那时你在那个避难所，"丹尼尔指出，"你及时回来避免了彻底的灾难。你找到了战斗的意志。虽然我敢肯定，如果你能和明日香一起发动联合攻击，她会更感激。你们两个联手，再加上绫波的助力，我想应该能对付得了雷里尔。

Asuka's grip on his left hand tightened and she growled, "You leave me hanging like that again, Ikari, and I get to rip your head and arms off." Her grip relaxed again. "And don't you dare ever vanish for a month like what happened after that, either. You made me worry, Third. And you're sworn to watch my back from now on, until I let you go, got it?"

明日香紧握着他的左手，低吼道：“再敢让我这样悬着，碇，我就把你的头和胳膊都扯下来。”她的手劲又松了下来。“还有，你也不许像上次那样消失一个月。你让我担心了，老三。从今往后，你得发誓保护我，直到我放你走，明白了吗？”

Shinji finally snapped out of his freeze, and jerked his stare up from his hand to Asuka's face, blushing. "Uh... yes. Yes, my l-l-love."

真嗣终于从僵硬中回过神来，猛地将目光从自己的手上移到明日香的脸庞，脸颊泛红。“呃……是的。是的，我、我、我的爱人。”

"'My l-l-love', nothing! This is an order from your squad leader, understand?" Asuka retorted, inwardly glad she was managing to keep the grin off her face that wanted to break out on hearing him say it again, and in front of other people!

"'我的爱'，少来这套！这是你班长下的命令，明白了吗？" 明日香反驳道，内心庆幸自己成功抑制住了在听到他再次当众说出那句话时想要绽放的笑容！

Daniel raised an eyebrow. "Squad leader? Would you like us to switch out your new toy for a pair of single-seat NAM-91A's instead of the two-seat trainer you've got? You don't have to fight together in one mecha if you'd rather be at the head of a squad."

丹尼尔挑了挑眉。“小队长？你想让我们把你的新玩具换成一对单座的 NAM-91A，而不是你现在用的双座教练机吗？如果你更愿意带领一个小队，不必非得和别人共乘一台机甲。”

Asuka jerked at the suggestion, and smothered an unpleasant pang of dismay at the idea. She groped for an excuse. "No! I... I mean, I just got my pretty Red Whirlwind as a present yesterday! I can't just put that aside so quickly! It would insult the gift the fine people on 'my' ship gave me to do that!"

明日香对这个提议猛地一惊，随即压抑住内心的不快与失望。她急忙寻找借口：“不！我……我是说，我昨天才收到漂亮的红色旋风作为礼物！我不能这么快就把它搁置一边！那样做会辜负了船上那些好人送给我的礼物！”

"Of course, we cannot offer insult to the good crew of the 'Red Demon', can we?" Rayana agreed. "Shame on you for making such a suggestion, dear."

"当然，我们不能对'红魔'号的优秀船员们不敬，对吧？" 雷亚娜赞同道，"亲爱的，你提出这样的建议真是太不应该了。"

"Lawks, where is my head? Of course we can't take away your brand new ride. Consider the idea tossed, Asuka," Daniel said dryly, not batting an eye. He leaned forward and looked hard at Shinji. "Now, Shinji, I didn't bring up the 13th Angel because I wanted you to have to relive bad memories. I need to ask you; knowing what you know now about Touji being the Pilot of Unit-03, the threat an Angel getting into NERV HQ represented, and how your refusal to fight led to Rei and Asuka facing the next Angel without you, would you do the same again? Or would you fight for your friends and family, even if you had to risk harming Touji?"

"哎呀，我这脑子怎么了？当然不能夺走你崭新的座驾。这个提议作废，飞鸟。"丹尼尔干巴巴地说道，眼睛都没眨一下。他倾身向前，目光锐利地盯着真嗣，"那么，真嗣，我提起第 13 使徒并非想让你重温不愉快的记忆。我需要问你：现在你知道了，当知道东治是 03 号机的驾驶员，使徒入侵 NERV 总部的威胁，以及你拒绝战斗导致零和飞鸟在没有你的情况下面对下一个使徒，你会再次做出同样的选择吗？还是你会为了朋友和家人而战，哪怕这意味着可能伤害到东治？"

"...No. I wouldn't do it the same. It's easy to say now that I'd fight, knowing how bad it would turn out if I didn't. But... yes, I would fight. There were no civilians around to get hurt, and I wouldn't let my father turn the Dummy Plug on someone like that. I couldn't have been as bad as the Dummy Plug. And... gods, I wouldn't have to spend all the time since regretting how my actions led to people getting hurt like those ones in the shelter."

“不，我不会以同样的方式去做。现在说我会反抗很容易，因为我知道如果不反抗，结果会有多糟。但是……是的，我会反抗。周围没有平民会受伤，我不会让父亲那样的人使用傀儡插入栓。我不可能像傀儡插入栓那样糟糕。而且……天哪，我就不用自那以后一直后悔我的行为导致像那些在避难所里的人受伤。”

"Don't worry about them, we've got a Ranger doing a rescue-swap out on the people in that shelter already. Anyone who was going to get hurt we'll rescue and replace with a meat-puppet to take the hit. They'll be on Second Chance and getting prepared for repatriation as part of the Army push on South America," Rayana said comfortingly.

别担心他们，我们已经派了一位游侠去那个避难所进行救援交换。任何可能受伤的人我们都会救出并用替身顶替，让他们在“第二次机会”计划中准备重返，作为军队南美推进的一部分。雷亚娜安慰道。

"And I'm very glad you could say you've thought about it, and that you'd do it differently. It would be hard for you to deal with what we're about to do next if you hadn't. You may still have the urge to let him punch you in the face in the name of karmic balance, though," Daniel said with a smile. He tapped his interface band once, and sat back.

我很高兴你能说你已经考虑过这个问题，并且你会用不同的方式去做。如果你没有这样想过，接下来我们要做的事情对你来说可能会很难处理。尽管如此，你可能仍然有冲动让他以因果报应的名义打你的脸，”丹尼尔微笑着说。他轻触了一下接口带，然后向后靠去。

"What are you talking about? What's next?" Shinji asked.

“你在说什么？接下来呢？” 真嗣问道。

"A couple of friends are going come back out of the cabin they're in behind me, and bring out some more drinks. You like anything?"

几个朋友正要从我身后的木屋里出来，再带些饮料。你想要点什么吗？

"Um, no, I'm good. Asuka?"

呃，不用了，我挺好的。明日香呢？

She shook her head as well. "No. What do drink orders have to do with the fight with the 13th Angel?"

她也摇了摇头。“不，点饮料和与第 13 使徒的战斗有什么关系？”

"Drink orders, not very much, but the people bringing the drinks will probably be happier to hear that Shinji would fight this time. Might save some trouble anyway, if you don't have a drink in your hand when she tackles you," Daniel said absently, reaching down for his coconut. "Four, three, two..."

"点的不多，但送饮料的人听到这次真嗣会反抗，大概会更高兴些。至少，如果她扑过来时你手里没拿着饮料，能省点麻烦。"丹尼尔心不在焉地说着，伸手去拿他的椰子。"四，三，二……"

This did not clear up Asuka's confusion. "What are you tal—" The tackle took her right out of the chair and into the sand beside her.

这并未消除明日香的困惑。“你在说——”话音未落，她就被撞得从椅子上摔了下来，跌落在旁边的沙地上。

"ASUKA!OHMIGODYOU'REALIVEYOU'REALIVEI'MSOGLADTOSEEYOU!" The blue and brunette blur that had struck her finally resolved itself into an extremely excited Hikari Horaki.

"ASUKA!天啊你真的活着你真的活着我太高兴见到你了！"那个蓝发和棕发交织的模糊身影终于清晰起来，原来是异常激动的堀木光。

"Ack! What? Who? Hikari?" Asuka collected herself as best she could while half upside-down and with Hikari still all over her. "Hikari! It's great to see you too, but could you let me up?"

"啊！什么？谁？光？" 明日香尽可能地让自己镇定下来，尽管她半倒挂着，身上还缠着光。"光！见到你我也很高兴，但你能不能先让我起来？"

"Sorry! Sorry! I'm just so happy to see you! You too, Ikari-kun!" Hikari untangled herself from Asuka and stood back up. In doing so she nearly backed into the boy right behind her who was holding a couple of cans of soda.

"对不起！对不起！我只是太高兴见到你了！还有你，碇君！" 光子从明日香身边挣脱出来，站起身来。在这个过程中，她差点撞到站在她身后、手里拿着几罐汽水的男孩。

"Careful, Class Rep! Yo, Shinji. You've gotten taller. And you got older, Demon." Touji Suzuhara put the sodas on the small table in between the chairs.

"小心点，班长！哟，真嗣。你长高了。还有，你变老了，恶魔。" 铃原东治把汽水放在两把椅子之间的小桌上。

Asuka gave him a sharp death-glare, but said sweetly, "What? I'm sorry, could you come closer and speak into my good ear? My hearing isn't what it used to be."

明日香狠狠地瞪了他一眼，语气却甜美地说：“什么？对不起，你能靠近点，对着我那只好耳朵说吗？我的听力不如从前了。”

Touji obligingly stepped nearer and bent down to talk right into her ear. "I said, you go—GLURK-"

冬至顺从地走近，弯腰对着她的耳朵低语：“我说，你走——咕噜——”

Asuka's grip on his collar twisted and easily cut off his breath, and she bashed him on the head hard enough to drop him into the sand. "Stooge," she said dismissively.

明日香紧抓着他的衣领，轻易地切断了他的呼吸，然后用力猛击他的头部，使他一头栽进沙子里。“走狗，”她不屑地说道。

Part 27 第 27 章

Angels & Demons 天使与魔鬼

Rayana shook her head and said, "He's just a charmer with women, isn't he? You think he'd learn after she nearly pulled his ear off on the beach. Poor form to drool over a woman like that, especially when her husband is standing right there. Horaki-chan helpfully reminded him of his manners."

蕾亚娜摇了摇头说：“他只是对女人有一套，不是吗？以为在海滩上她差点把他的耳朵扯下来之后，他会学乖。那样当着人家丈夫的面垂涎一个女人，真是太失礼了。堀木小妹妹还热心地提醒了他注意礼貌。”

Asuka turned back to her friend. "Hikari, I...wow...um, you don't look any different."

明日香转头看向她的朋友。“光，我……哇……呃，你看起来没什么变化。”

Hikari sat in the chair next to her and looked back at her in matching confusion. "And you do look older, Asuka. What happened to both of you?"

光坐在她旁边的椅子上，同样困惑地回头看着她。“而且你看起来确实更成熟了，明日香。你们俩都发生了什么？”

Asuka shot a glance at their hosts. Rayana just nodded and gave her a 'go ahead' gesture. "Let me guess, your first clear memory in a long while is waking up underwater on a beach, with these two waiting for you? Preceded by a bunch of really strange dreams, memories that don't feel like yours, and weird perspectives on things in your head?"

明日香瞥了一眼他们的主人。雷亚娜只是点了点头，并给了她一个“继续”的手势。“让我猜猜，你很久以来的第一个清晰记忆是在海滩上醒来，发现自己泡在水里，而这两位正在等你？在这之前是一连串非常奇怪的梦境，感觉不属于自己的记忆，以及脑海中对事物的奇怪视角？”

Asuka ignored Touji's angry look as he sat in one of the empty chairs on the far side of Hikari and brushed the sand off himself. Hikari nodded. "And then they brought us here said you'd be here in a little while to explain things. Are we really on another world?"

明日香无视了东治坐在光旁边远处空椅子上时愤怒的表情，拍掉了身上的沙子。光点了点头。“然后他们把我们带到这里，说你一会儿会来解释情况。我们真的在另一个世界吗？”

Asuka blew out a breath of air. "That's going to take a bit of explaining. Ah..." She looked at Daniel and Rayana again. "A little help?"

明日香吐出一口气。“这得费点口舌解释了。啊……”她再次看向丹尼尔和雷亚娜。“帮点忙？”

Rayana shrugged and said, "Short version for now; The Angels were trying to get at their father-progenitor creature, ADAM, which was hidden under NERV HQ. If they could do that, it would trigger the Third Impact, wipe out all human life on Earth, and make the Angel that did it into a god, for all practical purposes. A group calling itself SEELE controlled the UN and figured out the Angels' nature and intent well before the Second Impact, which SEELE in fact caused, because they knew that if all the Angels were killed, they could hijack the process and make themselves gods instead. Gendo Ikari screwed everybody when he did it himself to have a chance to reunite with Shinji's mother, Yui. When he set off the Third Impact it collapsed all human souls into one single mass-consciousness. Ayanami-san, who was in fact a half-Angel clone of Shinji's mother, refused him the control he intended and gave control of the Third Impact to Shinji here. He eventually decided that all of humanity living as one giant blob of souls with no ego borders was not the way to go and told Ayanami-san to make it possible for everyone to return to their bodies and seek happiness. Shinji and Asuka were the first to return, and over the last four years more people have also incarnated, but about two-thirds of the population is still in the Ring of Souls around Earth. People pulled out of that, such as yourselves, return to bodies that match your last mental self-image. So Suzuhara-san gets his arm and leg back intact, and you both haven't aged at all. Asuka and Shinji came out four years ago, so they really are a bit older than you now. Oh, and yes, you really are on another world. Welcome to Avalon. Take off your shoes and stay awhile." She looked back to Asuka. "Good enough for the moment?"

雷亚娜耸了耸肩，说道：“现在简单说一下；天使们试图接近他们父亲般的始祖生物——ADAM，它隐藏在 NERV 总部下方。如果他们成功，将引发第三次冲击，抹去地球上所有人类生命，并使引发这一事件的天使实际上成为神。一个自称 SEELE 的组织控制了联合国，并在第二次冲击之前就已洞悉了天使的本质和意图，事实上第二次冲击正是 SEELE 所为，因为他们知道如果所有天使都被消灭，他们就能劫持这一过程，让自己成为神。源堂元帅在为了有机会与真嗣的母亲唯重聚时，把所有人都坑了。当他启动第三次冲击时，所有人类的灵魂都坍缩成了单一的集体意识。实际上是真嗣母亲半天使克隆体的绫波小姐拒绝了他原本的控制意图，并将第三次冲击的控制权交给了真嗣。最终，真嗣认为全人类作为一个没有自我界限的巨大灵魂团块生活并非正道，于是告诉绫波小姐让每个人都能回到自己的身体，去追求幸福。 真嗣和明日香是最先回来的，过去四年里也有更多人转生，但仍有约三分之二的人口留在环绕地球的灵魂之环中。像你们这样被拉出来的人，会回到与你们最后心理自我形象相符的身体里。所以，铃原先生恢复了完好的手臂和腿，而你们俩都没有任何衰老。真嗣和明日香四年前就出来了，所以他们现在确实比你们大一点。哦，对了，你们确实来到了另一个世界。欢迎来到阿瓦隆。脱掉鞋子，留下来吧。"她回头看向明日香，"暂时这样解释可以吗？"

Hikari looked back and forth between Rayana and Asuka. "...That made no sense. What?"

光在蕾雅娜和明日香之间来回看了看。“……这根本说不通。什么？”

"Wait until we tell you about how Asuka and Shinji were instrumental to the success of a coup against a brutal world dictator by Piloting a half-working Evangelion Unit," Daniel chimed in with a smile.

"等着听我们讲讲明日香和真嗣是如何驾驶着半残的 EVA 机体，对一个残暴的世界独裁者发起政变并取得成功的故事吧，"丹尼尔笑着插话道。

Hikari and Touji regarded the two Pilots with wide eyes. "Asuka," Hikari finally said, "What in the world has been going on?"

光和东治睁大眼睛看着两位驾驶员。“明日香，”光终于开口，“这到底是怎么回事？”

"Yeah, Shinji, what's is all thi-" Touji cut off in surprise as Shinji suddenly stood up and moved over to Touji's chair and hugged him.

"嗯，真嗣，这是怎么回事——" 当真嗣突然站起来，走到东治的椅子旁并拥抱他时，东治惊讶得话都没说完。

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry," Shinji said into his friend's shoulder. "I...because I...wouldn't fight when your Eva was taken over by that Angel...I'm sorry..."

"对不起，真的很对不起，" 真嗣将头埋在朋友肩上说道，"我……因为我……在你的 Eva 被使徒控制时没有战斗……对不起……"

"Hey, hey, what are you talking about? All I remember is trying to start the synch test with Unit-03, I got a blinding headache, and then I woke up in the hospital with one leg and a smashed arm."

"嘿，嘿，你在说什么呢？我只记得试图用三号机进行同步测试，突然一阵剧烈的头痛，然后醒来就在医院里，一条腿没了，手臂也碎了。"

"An Angel somehow took over your Eva. NERV deployed us in ours to stop you. We didn't do so well," Asuka explained. "Wondergirl and I got taken out, and baka-Shinji didn't want to fight the Angel because he was worried he'd hurt whoever the Pilot was. He didn't know it was you until the end, Stooge. But his Arschloch father kicked in an autopilot system called a Dummy Plug, and it went totally berserker on your Eva. Ripped it apart way past when the fight was over, then crushed your Entry Plug. Baka-Shinji here is just feeling guilty that he didn't fight himself, and blames himself for you getting hurt. We just had a little talk on that topic." She looked significantly at Daniel.

"不知怎的，一个天使控制了你的 EVA。NERV 派我们驾驶自己的 EVA 去阻止你。我们表现得并不好，"明日香解释道，"我和绫波都出局了，而笨蛋真嗣不想与天使战斗，因为他担心会伤害到驾驶者。直到最后他才知道是你，小丑。但他那混蛋父亲启动了一个叫 Dummy Plug 的自动驾驶系统，结果你的 EVA 彻底失控了。战斗结束后还把你的 EVA 撕得粉碎，然后压扁了你的插入栓。笨蛋真嗣现在只是因为自己没有亲自战斗而感到内疚，并自责让你受伤。我们刚刚就这个话题稍微聊了一下。"她意味深长地看了丹尼尔一眼。

"But I'm okay now, Shinji! Relax! See, I got my leg back and everything." Touji pulled Shinji away and sat him back up. "Hey, wait! If I got my leg back, can you do the same for my sister?" he asked their hosts.

但我现在没事了，真嗣！放松点！看，我的腿回来了，一切都好。” 东治拉着真嗣，让他坐直。“嘿，等等！如果我的腿能回来，那你能也帮我妹妹恢复吗？”他向主人询问道。

"Sure can. We'll do a pickup on both of your families after we're done here, maybe this afternoon," Rayana said. "For lunch, we've got a campaign to plan. We'll collect you four and the other two, and we'll go over how much you are ready to be involved."

当然可以。我们这边结束后，或许今天下午，就会去接你们两家的家人。" 雷亚娜说道， "至于午餐，我们得策划一下行动。我们会接上你们四个和其他两位，然后讨论你们准备参与的程度。

"Other two?" Hikari asked.

"还有两个？"光问道。

"They picked up Misato and Kaji-san yesterday. They're on one of the other islands around here," Asuka said. "And be ready for them to be annoyingly cute; Misato got him to ask her to marry her. She's got a huge ring on now." Funny, that didn't bother her as much as it had yesterday. Not after this morning.

他们昨天接到了美里和加持先生。他们就在这附近的一个岛上，”明日香说，“准备好迎接他们那烦人的甜蜜吧；美里让他向她求婚了。她现在戴着一枚超大的戒指。”说来奇怪，这事儿今天没昨天那么让她心烦了。毕竟今早之后。

Asuka had underestimated Hikari's romantic streak. "Really?" her friend squealed happily. Asuka suddenly found herself pinned by Hikari's alarmingly bright grin. "Ne, Asuka, didn't I just also see you and Ikari-kun holding hands? Something going on, hmm? It's been four years for you, are you together now? Tell me tell me tell me!"

明日香低估了光的热恋倾向。"真的吗？"她的朋友开心地尖叫道。明日香突然发现自己被光那异常灿烂的笑容所困。"呐，明日香，我刚才不也看到你和碇君牵手了吗？是不是有什么情况，嗯？你们已经四年了，现在在一起了吗？快告诉我告诉我告诉我！"

Shinji turned the color of a ripe tomato. "Ah HAH!" Hikari pounced. "There is something going on! I knew you two cared about each other! Everyone could see it!" She let out a string of ecstatic noises. It was the first time in her life Asuka had actually heard someone 'squee'.

真嗣的脸红得像熟透的番茄。"啊哈！" 明日香趁机追问，"果然有情况！我就知道你们俩互相关心！大家都看得出来！" 她发出一连串兴奋的尖叫声。这是明日香有生以来第一次听到有人发出"斯奎"的声音。

"Say it ain't so, Shinji! You've made a deal with the Devil?!" Touji wailed.

“说这不是真的，真嗣！你和魔鬼做了交易？！”东治哀嚎道。

"Um...um...that is...we..." Shinji mumbled into the ground at his feet.

"呃...呃...就是...我们..." 真嗣低头对着脚下的地面喃喃自语。

"We were...separated for most of the last four years. Yes, we were in the middle of overthrowing the thug who'd appointed himself head of the UN after he seized the stockpile of N2 mines. After the coup, ah...the Third and I came to an arrangement. That was a month ago. We're still working out the details," Asuka said carefully. She was proud of herself. She'd managed to redden only a fraction as much as the Third had, and could still form a coherent sentence. "Things have changed a bit recently since our mysterious hosts appeared in our tent and offered to give us a hand at um...rebuilding our world and such, undoing all the damage Commander Ikari and SEELE did to us all. In the last couple of days..." Asuka felt herself starting to lose the fight with the grin that was threatening to grow on her face. Her pulse was already racing ahead. "Um...we've...um...said a few things to each other. He...promised he'd watch my back from now on, and...hey, I've got this great new mecha they gave me, way more powerful than an Evangelion, and they even painted it to look like my Unit-02!"

我们过去四年里大部分时间都是分开的。没错，我们当时正忙于推翻那个自封为联合国首脑并控制了 N2 地雷储备的暴徒。政变之后，呃……我和第三号达成了某种协议。那是一个月前的事了。我们仍在敲定细节，”明日香小心翼翼地说道。她为自己感到骄傲，因为她的脸只比第三号红了一点点，而且还能组织出连贯的句子。“最近情况有些变化，自从我们神秘的主人出现在帐篷里，提出要帮助我们重建世界，消除碇司令和 SEELE 对我们造成的所有伤害。就在这两天里……”明日香感觉到自己快要抵挡不住那即将在脸上绽放的笑容了。她的心跳已经加速。“嗯……我们……嗯……互相说了些话。他……承诺从今往后会保护我，而且……嘿，我得到了他们给我的这台超棒的新机甲，比 EVA 强大得多，他们甚至还把它涂成了我二号机的样子！”

Hikari wasn't going to be thrown off the scent that easily. She brushed aside Asuka's attempted diversion like a shark that had smelled blood in the water. Her grin was the same, too. "Is that all, Asuka? Just 'said a few things', mm?" She looked at Shinji, and Asuka could almost see the tumblers click in her head. Hikari's eyes widened. "Ohmigod! Asuka, did he confess to you?!"

光并不是那么容易就被转移注意力的。她像嗅到水中血腥味的鲨鱼一样，轻易地拨开了明日香的转移话题。她的笑容依旧。“就这样吗，明日香？只是‘说了几句话’，嗯？”她看向真嗣，明日香几乎能看见她脑海中的齿轮转动。光的眼睛瞪大了。“天啊！明日香，他向你表白了吗？！”

Shinji's face edged towards incandescent. Asuka's started to follow. She managed a very tiny nod.

真嗣的脸庞逐渐变得炽热如火。明日香的脸色也开始随之变化。她勉强点了一下头，幅度极小。

This time Hikari's squeals probably were heard by any dogs nearby and any dolphins offshore. Daniel wiggled a finger in his ear and looked at Rayana. "Wow, that was less than five minutes. I owe you a foot massage."

这次，光的声音恐怕连附近的狗和近海的海豚都听见了。丹尼尔用手指掏了掏耳朵，看向瑞安娜。“哇，还不到五分钟。我欠你一次足部按摩。”

Rayana managed not to look too smug. "Told you so. Want to go double or nothing on Asuka's counter?"

蕾安娜尽量不显得太得意。“早就告诉你了。要不要再赌一把明日香的反击，赌注翻倍还是归零？”

"No bet." “不赌。”

"Chicken." 鸡。

Asuka reddened further and almost threw a 'counterattack' at the quietly smiling couple. She instead froze entirely when she felt Shinji's hand take hers again. Touji's mouth was hanging open as he watched the terrifying sight of his buddy falling under the power of the dreaded Red Demon. Hikari had both hands over her mouth and looked like she was about to unleash some more squees that bats on the other side of Avalon would pick up. And Shinji...was looking at her and smiling again. "Yes, I did. Just this morning." he said just loud enough for them to hear.

明日香的脸更红了，几乎要向那对微笑着的情侣发起“反击”。然而，当她再次感受到真嗣握住她的手时，她整个人都僵住了。东治目瞪口呆地看着他的好友在可怕的红魔力量下沦陷的惊人一幕。而光双手捂着嘴，看起来她即将发出更多连阿瓦隆另一边的蝙蝠都能捕捉到的尖叫。至于真嗣……他再次看着她，微笑着。“是的，我确实这么做了。就在今天早上。”他大声说道，刚好让他们听见。

A shrinking but still vocal part of Asuka's mind wanted to hit him over the head for embarrassing them in front of other people like that and storm off, or flee, whatever was faster. But a growing part shouted it down and practically wallowed in the wave of emotion that left her feeling like her blood was fizzing. 'He's mine! He's mine! He likes me! He looks at me!' His hand in hers did calm her vibrating brain enough to organize a counter-sally against Hikari's relentless romantic questioning. Asuka Langley Sohryu never backed down from a fight. This was just another kind. 'You wanted romantic details? Fine, open wide, sister...'

尽管阿苏卡心中仍有一小部分在叫嚣着，想要为了他在众人面前让他们难堪而给他当头一棒，然后愤然离去，或是逃离，哪种更快就选哪种。但越来越多的声音将这念头压了下去，几乎沉溺于那股让她感觉血液都在沸腾的情感浪潮中。'他是我的！他是我的！他喜欢我！他在看我！'他的手握着她的，确实让她的思绪平静到足以组织起对光子那无休止的浪漫追问的反击。阿苏卡·兰格雷·索尔修从不退缩于任何战斗。这只是另一种形式。'你想听浪漫细节？好啊，姐姐，张大嘴吧……'

"Yes. Yes he did. After he made me breakfast in bed. Our bed; we've been sleeping together for the last month. He did offer to wash my back, but I got out of the shower before he was done cooking," Asuka said, far more coolly than she felt. 'What they don't know about the specifics therein of how we got in that situation is just fine,´ she thought. Hikari turned puce. Touji seemed on the verge of passing out. 'Excellent. Now for the killing strike.' "So, Hikari...Shinji finally manned up and told me how wonderful he thinks I am. How about you? Have you told Touji about how you feel?"

"是的，他确实这么做了。在我床上给我做了早餐。我们的床；过去一个月我们一直睡在一起。他确实提出要帮我洗背，但我趁他还在做饭时从浴室出来了。" 明日香说，比她实际感觉的要冷静得多。"他们不知道我们是如何陷入那种情况的细节，这正好。" 她心想。光的脸色变得通红。东治似乎快要晕过去了。"很好，现在来个致命一击。" "那么，光...真嗣终于鼓起勇气告诉我他觉得我有多么出色。你呢？你有没有告诉东治你的感受？"

If Touji's eyes got any wider, they'd pop. His head robotically creaked around to stare at Hikari. "C-c-class Rep?"

如果东二的眼睛再睁大一点，恐怕就要掉出来了。他的头机械地吱嘎作响，转向盯着光。“班、班、班长？”

Hikari said nothing. She didn't make a sound or move...until she fell over, out cold, and landed with her head in Touji's lap.

光一言不发，她没有发出任何声音，也没有动弹……直到她突然倒下，昏迷不醒，头落在了东二的腿上。

"And it's a solid hit and a KO! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Germany wins!" Daniel dryly commented. "Looks like you're going to have to wait for a bit to get an answer on that one, kid. But hey, at least she landed in your lap. Maybe that's a good sign?"

“这是一记重拳，直接击倒！弗雷泽倒下了！弗雷泽倒下了！德国赢了！”丹尼尔干巴巴地评论道，“看来你得等会儿才能得到答案了，孩子。不过，至少她落到了你怀里，说不定这是个好兆头呢？”

Touji's eyes rolled up and he slumped over on top of Hikari.

冬二的眼睛翻了上去，整个人瘫倒在小光身上。

"Yup, smooth with the ladies," Rayana said, in German again. "That'll teach her to dive into a battle she's not ready for, eh, Asuka?"

"嗯，对女士们挺有一套的，" 雷亚娜用德语再次说道，"这会教会她，不要贸然投入自己还没准备好的战斗，对吧，明日香？"

Asuka clenched her free hand to hide the shaking. "Yeah, shows her."

明日香紧握着空着的那只手，以掩饰颤抖。“对，让她看看。”

Daniel stood up and picked Touji up off of Hikari. Rayana picked Hikari up. "Well, let's get these two shrinking violets inside," he said. "Your call, Asuka: Do we put them in separate beds, or set them on the couch with their arms around each other?"

丹尼尔站起来，把图吉从光身上抱起。雷亚娜则抱起了光。“好了，我们把这两个害羞的家伙带进屋吧，”他说，“你决定，明日香：我们是让他们分开睡，还是让他们坐在沙发上互相拥抱？”

"Heh. That would be funny to get on video, but I don't need to rub in my victory that much," Asuka smirked. "Them just waking up holding hands will be sufficient."

“嘿，要是能录下来肯定很有趣，不过我也不至于非得这么炫耀我的胜利，”明日香得意地笑了笑，“他们醒来时手牵手就足够了。”

Part 28 第二十八章

All In 全力以赴

Asuka did decide that a set of pictures and a video of them waking up were good for teasing Hikari with later. They did blush hilariously when they woke almost simultaneously. Hikari and Touji both paled white as sheets as Asuka and Shinji gave them the history of the events after Touji's hospitalization at the hands of Eva Unit-01 and the 13th Angel and the evacuation of most of Tokyo-3's population after the destruction from the 14th, 15th, and 16th; the Third Impact, a brief account of Instrumentality shorn of the more personal bits, and a likewise edited summary of the post-Third Impact wasteland of warlords, starvation, and chaos. Hikari may have been her closest friend in school, but Asuka was far from ready to tell her the ugly details of what she'd gone through once Winthrop had solidified his control of the UN N2 stockpile and Berlin. Their shocked faces at even the edited account were bad enough. Asuka had no problem accepting Hikari's tearful hug by the end.

明日香确实认为，拍下他们醒来的照片和视频，日后用来逗弄光是个不错的主意。他们几乎同时醒来时那羞涩的模样实在令人捧腹。当真嗣和明日香向光和冬二讲述了冬二在初号机与第十三使徒手中住院后的事件经过，包括第十四、十五、十六使徒造成的破坏，以及东京三大部分人口的撤离；还有第三冲击，一个剔除了个人细节的关于人类补完计划的简述，以及同样经过编辑的第三冲击后军阀割据、饥荒与混乱的荒芜景象时，光和冬二的脸色苍白如纸。尽管光可能是她在学校最亲密的朋友，但明日香远未准备好向她透露自己在温思罗普巩固了对联合国 N2 武器库和柏林的控制后所经历的那些不堪回首的细节。即便是经过编辑的叙述，也足以让他们震惊不已。最终，明日香毫不介意接受了光泪眼婆娑的拥抱。

Daniel and Rayana had slipped out after Asuka and Shinji had begun their tale. They returned just after she'd finished with Misato and Kaji in tow. Both couples wore serious expressions that set Shinij's stomach to churning. Misato wore a look like that before missions.

丹尼尔和雷亚娜在明日香和真嗣开始讲述他们的故事后悄悄溜了出去。她刚一讲完，两人就带着美里和加持回来了。两对情侣都面色凝重，让真嗣感到一阵胃痛。美里在执行任务前也常是这种表情。

Daniel noted Shinji's anxious look and gave him a comforting wave. "Relax, Shinji. We're not about to roll out to start the war this afternoon. This is just for planning. We need to know how much you all want to be involved before we start detailed operations planning." Shinji relaxed a bit, but the prospect of war still on the horizon would not let him let go of the tension completely.

丹尼尔注意到真嗣焦虑的神情，便向他投去一个安慰的手势。“放松点，真嗣。我们今天下午并不是要出征开战。这只是计划阶段。在我们开始详细作战规划之前，我们需要了解你们希望参与的程度。”真嗣稍微放松了一些，但战争的阴影仍在地平线上徘徊，让他无法完全释放紧张感。

The cabin evidently prepared for Hikari and Touji had much the same appearance as their own. They settled themselves around the chairs and couches in the living room. The prosaic setting of the living room as where they'd choose their roles in a war, maybe just the preamble to rebuilding their world, only heightened Shinji's unease. He felt his hand start twitching like it wanted to begin clinching and relaxing again. He stilled it with conscious effort.

显然为光和冬二准备的这间小屋与他们自己的住所颇为相似。他们在客厅的椅子和沙发上安顿下来。在这个平凡的客厅里选择他们在战争中的角色，或许只是重建他们世界的序幕，这更加剧了真嗣的不安。他感到自己的手开始不由自主地想要握紧又放松。他刻意控制住，让它静止下来。

"We are not going to be setting off until you all are ready for whatever part you feel ready to play in all this," Daniel began, standing with his back to the comm screen. "So don't get too wound up and tense. Our arrival timeframe on your world is something we can control as part of the portal generation. We don't have to advance a day there for a day here, we can spend a month here and still be back there before the next dawn on your world. So you have all the time you need to prepare yourselves. But this is when you start to make choices. This is your world, and once again, the power of its future is in your hands."

"我们不会在你们准备好承担各自角色之前出发，"丹尼尔背对着通讯屏幕说道，"所以不必过于紧张。我们到达你们世界的时间框架，作为门户生成的一部分，是可以控制的。我们不必一天换一天，我们可以在这里待一个月，仍然能在你们世界下一次黎明前返回。因此，你们有足够的时间来准备自己。但现在是你们开始做出选择的时候了。这是你们的世界，未来又一次掌握在你们手中。"

"I've been there before," Shinji said in a low voice. "I nearly destroyed everything and doomed everyone. I don't want that kind of burden again."

"我曾到过那里，" 真嗣低声说道，"我差点毁了一切，让所有人陷入绝望。我不想再背负那样的重担了。"

Rayana spoke gently. "And it is exactly because you do not want that kind of power that we feel we can trust you with it, Shinji. The kind of people who want power over others are those we try hardest to keep away from such, and the kind most likely to abuse if they do obtain it. Look at Winthrop, or Jinnai. They wanted power badly, and you know what kind of world that created. You're worried because the last time you had this kind of power in your hands you think you handled it badly. We disagree; it could have been far, far worse. Imagine if that power had been in your father's hands, or worse, Lorenz Keel's? We've seen the worlds where they won; you wouldn't like them. In one world where your father won he literally remade the world as an almost ideal life for everyone he knew… and erased you from existence, Shinji." Rayana tilted her head and smiled at the two of them. "Although even in that world, a certain genius redhead who didn't even remember a Pilot who'd never existed at all to her still developed an entire Dirac Sea theory to open a portal to the world Gendo had left behind. She deduced why Chancellor Ikari of her university was trying to shut down her project, confronted him in a perfect Holmesian trap to get the truth about the son he'd condemned to living in the emptied Earth alone until he died, and jumped through the portal before Chancellor Ikari could shut it down to rescue the comrade she kept remembering fighting alongside in her dreams of a world that hadn't happened. Even a universe where you'd been edited out of reality couldn't keep Asuka from finding you."

蕾雅娜轻声说道：“正因为你并不渴望那种力量，我们才觉得可以将它托付给你，真嗣。那些渴望掌控他人的人，是我们最尽力阻止接近这种力量的，也是最有可能滥用权力的人。看看温斯洛普或金奈吧，他们极度渴望权力，你也知道那创造了怎样的世界。你担心是因为上次你掌握这种力量时，你认为自己处理得很糟糕。我们并不这么认为；其实情况本可能更糟。想象一下，如果那种力量落在你父亲手中，或者更糟，洛伦兹·基尔的手中？我们见识过他们胜利的世界；你不会喜欢的。在一个你父亲获胜的世界里，他几乎将世界重塑成了他所认识的每个人的理想生活……而你，真嗣，被从存在中抹去了。”蕾雅娜侧着头，对两人微笑道：“尽管在那个世界里，一位连记忆中都不曾有过你这位从未存在的驾驶员的天才红发少女，仍然发展出了一整套狄拉克海理论，只为打开通往源堂所遗留世界的门户。” 她推断出大学校长伊卡里为何试图关闭她的项目，巧妙地设下福尔摩斯式的陷阱与他对峙，揭露了他将儿子流放到荒芜地球直至死亡的真相，并在伊卡里关闭传送门之前跳入其中，去拯救那个在未曾发生的梦境世界中与她并肩作战的同伴。即便是在你被现实抹去的宇宙里，也无法阻止明日香找到你。"

Her smile faded away. "Shinji, you were at the lowest possible psychological and spiritual ebb when Ayanami-san gave you that power. You know the costs now. Do you feel that defeated anymore, or do you think your life is a little better and you a little stronger now? You are far from alone this time. You will not make these choices alone, nor will you have to bear that burden alone. Have faith in yourself, your friends, and in us as well. We will not let you despair and fail. No sparrow shall fall, that we do not see it."

她的笑容逐渐消失。"真嗣，当绫波给了你那份力量时，你的心理和精神正处于最低谷。你现在知道了代价。你还觉得自己被打败了吗，还是你认为生活变得更好，自己也变得更强大了？这次你并不孤单。你不会独自做出这些选择，也不必独自承担那份重担。相信自己，相信你的朋友，也相信我们。我们不会让你绝望和失败的。没有任何一只麻雀坠落，是我们看不见的。"

"This is also where you can choose to have as large or as little a part as you care to. You can lead the troops from the frontlines or opt out entirely and leave it all to us. But we're giving you right of first refusal. You are at a point of complete freedom. You, Asuka, and all of you," Daniel continued. "So again one of the ultimate questions; what do you want?"

这也是你可以选择参与多少的地方，你想扮演多大的角色就扮演多大的角色。你可以从前沿指挥部队，或者完全退出，把一切都交给我们。但我们给你优先拒绝权。你处于完全自由的状态。你，明日香，还有你们所有人，”丹尼尔继续说道，“所以再次提出那个终极问题：你想要什么？”

Misato and Kaji looked at each other and held hands tightly. "We're in. We both were ready to die to uncover the truth behind the evil bastards controlling our world before, and hey, I did!" said Kaji with a lopsided grin. "We can hardly leave it in the hands of people like Jinnai if we can do something about it. I'm not quite the soldier Misato is, but I'm sure there will be a role for a charming gentleman such as myself."

碇真嗣和加持相互对视，紧紧握住彼此的手。“我们进来了。我们俩都曾准备为揭露那些操控我们世界的恶棍背后的真相而牺牲，看，我真的做到了！”加持歪着嘴笑道。“如果我们能有所作为，就不能把事情交给像神无这样的人。我虽不及美里那样的战士，但我确信像我这样迷人的绅士定会有用武之地。”

Misato snorted. "Who was it who ninja'd his way into breaking Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki out of SEELE's hands? And you get yourself killed in the line of duty again, I'm going to let them bring you back to life so I can kill you myself for being so stupid twice! But yeah, I'm in, if you've got any use for a slightly-out-of-practice Operations Officer."

美里嗤笑一声。“当初是谁像忍者一样潜入，从 SEELE 手中救出副司令冬月？你要是再因公殉职，我就让他们把你复活，好让我亲自为你的愚蠢行为两次送你上路！不过，如果你觉得一个略显生疏的作战指挥官还有用武之地，那我加入。”

"I was an Eva Pilot for all of about three days, and one activation test that went bad in a real hurry. Hikari wasn't a Pilot or a soldier or nuthin'. What could we do?" Touji asked a little nervously.

我当 EVA 驾驶员总共也就三天，外加一次很快就搞砸的启动测试。光既不是驾驶员，也不是士兵，啥都不是。我们能怎么办？”东治有些紧张地问道。

"What do you want to do? We could train you up as a mecha pilot in less time than you'd believe," Rayana said. "If you want to go into the fight at your friends' side, we can do that. If you'd rather sit this war out, you can. Hikari... well, she might be more of a Pilot than you think."

“你想做什么？我们可以在你难以置信的短时间内把你训练成机甲驾驶员，”雷亚娜说。“如果你想与你的朋友们并肩作战，我们可以做到。如果你宁愿避开这场战争，也可以。光……嗯，她可能比你想象的更像一个飞行员。”

Hikari blinked. "Me?" she pointed to herself. "A Pilot?"

光眨了眨眼。“我？”她指着自己。“飞行员？”

Daniel nodded. "Everyone in your class was in there because they were a high-rated potential Pilot. I'm sure it was something of a taboo topic, but if you'd compared notes you'd likely have found that no one in your class had a living mother. And we're really hoping that was a filter effect and not an arranged circumstance."

丹尼尔点了点头。"你们班上的每个人之所以在那里，都是因为他们是高潜力飞行员。我敢肯定这是个禁忌话题，但如果你比较一下就会发现，你们班上没有人有活着的母亲。我们真心希望这只是筛选的结果，而非人为安排的情况。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes. That sounded ominous. "What do you mean?"

明日香眯起了眼睛。这话听起来不祥。“你什么意思？”

"In the set-up you were using, it took a mother's soul being placed in an Eva's core for the Pilot to synch with it. And we're hoping you were in that class and regarded as potential Pilots because your mothers were dead, and not that your mothers were killed and you placed in that class because you were potential Pilots," Rayana said darkly.

在您所使用的配置中，需要将一位母亲的灵魂置于 Eva 的核心内，驾驶员才能与之同步。我们希望您是因为母亲已故而被视为潜在驾驶员，从而进入那个班级，而不是因为您被视为潜在驾驶员，母亲才被杀害并被安排进那个班级，”雷亚娜阴沉地说道。

Touji and Hikari looked at each other. "You too?" they said simultaneously.

透二和光相互对视。“你也是？”他们异口同声地说。

Misato laughed, then frowned and nodded. "All of their classmates. Another little fact Ritz somehow never mentioned to me until after the 13th Angel."

碇真嗣笑了，随后皱起眉头，点了点头。“他们所有的同学。还有一个小细节，丽不知怎么的，直到第十三使徒之后才告诉我。”

"We figured something like that had to be the case after I proved the entire Marduk Institute was a hollow shell. Suzuhara-kun just 'happening' to be picked as a Pilot should have tipped us off," Kaji said evenly.

在我证实整个马杜克研究所不过是个空壳之后，我们便料到事情必定如此。铃原君恰好被选为驾驶员，这本该让我们警觉的。" 加持平静地说道。

Hikari looked at her hands in her lap for a moment. "I... I don't know. You've had a couple of days to think about this, haven't you, Asuka? Ikari-kun? I don't know if... or what I can do. Can we have some time to think about it?" she asked Daniel.

光低头凝视着自己膝上的双手，片刻后开口：“我……我不知道。你已经思考了几天这个问题，不是吗，明日香？碇君？我不确定……或者我能做些什么。我们能有些时间来考虑吗？”她向丹尼尔问道。

"Take your time. Nothing major will happen for at least a couple of days. I don't think any of you are quite ready to jump in an Entry Plug and take off tomorrow. Well, maybe Asuka," he conceded with a smile.

慢慢来，至少这几天不会有什么大事发生。我想你们谁也没准备好明天就跳进插入栓出发吧。嗯，也许明日香除外。" 他笑着让步道。

Everyone's eyes turned to the pair opposite Daniel and Rayana. Shinji tried to resist the urge to shrink into the cushions and disappear with all those eyes on him. He succeeded slightly more than he would have in past years, but only so much. "Um..." he hesitated. "I... you said you can set up the unit that goes with us with non-lethal gear? We can do this without killing innocents?" Daniel and Rayana nodded in unison. "Then I'm in if Asuka's in. I promised to watch her back. And... I think we've spent enough time apart. I go where she goes."

众人的目光齐刷刷地转向了丹尼尔和雷亚娜对面的那对。真嗣试图抵抗那种想要缩进靠垫里消失的冲动，在这么多双眼睛的注视下，他比往年稍微成功了一些，但也仅此而已。“呃……”他迟疑着开口，“我……你说过可以为我们配备非致命装备的单位？我们可以做到不伤害无辜者吗？”丹尼尔和雷亚娜同时点头。“那么，如果明日香加入，我也加入。我承诺过要保护她。而且……我想我们已经分开得够久了。她去哪儿，我就去哪儿。”

Everyone's eyes swung to Asuka. Shinji kept his head mostly down, but he too turned his head enough to watch her face closely. He could see a small, tight smile on her lips, and the beat of her pulse in her throat speeding up. He knew what she was going to say already. She'd want to be in the thick of it, winning glory and praise in the heat of battle. She was a fiery, unstoppable valkyrie, dancing in blood and death like a redheaded avatar of Kali... and he trailing right along with her, drawn to her fire even more than he was pushed away by her bloodlust and his own dislike of fighting.

众人的目光齐刷刷地转向明日香。真嗣虽大部分时间低头，但也侧过头来，紧盯着她的面庞。他注意到她唇边挂着一丝紧绷的微笑，喉间的脉搏加速跳动。他已预感到她将说出的话。她定会渴望置身激战之中，在战火中赢得荣耀与赞誉。她犹如一位炽热无畏的女武神，在血与死亡中翩翩起舞，宛若红发化身卡莉……而他，则紧随其后，被她的火焰吸引，甚至超越了对她嗜血及自身厌恶战斗的排斥。

"I'm in..." Shinji sighed. "...as long as we can keep casualties down." Shinji's head snapped up to meet her eyes. She looked back at him calmly. "No need for people to get caught in the crossfire if we can avoid it without compromising the mission, after all." She gave Shinji the barest ghost of a smile. 'Okay, this is a weird new aspect. Asuka giving a damn about what I think?'

"我加入..." 真嗣叹了口气。"...只要我们能尽量减少伤亡。" 真嗣猛地抬头，与她的目光相遇。她平静地回望着他。"毕竟，如果能不牺牲任务的前提下避免无辜者卷入，就没必要让他们受牵连。" 她对真嗣露出了几乎难以察觉的微笑。'好吧，这真是个奇怪的新情况。明日香竟然在乎我的想法？'

Daniel nodded. "A girl after my own heart. Alright, we'll start putting things in motion based on the four of you being involved, with provision for Horaki-san and Suzuhara-san to join in if desired in whatever capacity they feel comfortable with. Right now we're looking at an Army light division augmented with additional non-lethal attachments so we can focus our tactics as much as possible on incapacitation, forced immobility, and massive 'show of force' scares to keep as close as possible to the 'Nobody Dies' goal. You two in der Roter Wirbelsturm," he indicated Shinji and Asuka, "with a few squadrons of Army mecha behind you should make an impressive enough display to convince most anyone that fighting us is not a good idea. A StarStrider is considerably larger than the Army's standard Black Knight , and yours being bigger and red will make a good show as flight leader."

丹尼尔点头道：“真是心有灵犀的女孩。好吧，我们将根据你们四人参与的情况开始行动，并预留空间让洞木小姐和铃原先生在感到舒适的情况下以任何形式加入。目前我们计划组建一支陆军轻装师，并增配非致命性装备，以便尽可能专注于使对手丧失行动能力、强制固定以及大规模‘示威’恐吓，力求紧贴‘无人伤亡’的目标。你们两位在红色旋风中，”他指向真嗣和明日香，“再加上几支陆军机甲中队作为后盾，足以构成令人印象深刻的阵势，让大多数人明白与我们对抗并非明智之举。星际飞翔者比陆军的标准黑骑士要大得多，而你们那更大且红色的机体作为飞行领队，定能展现出良好的威慑效果。”

"Flight leader?" Asuka asked, slightly surprised. Misato also looked a little curious.

"飞行队长？" 明日香略带惊讶地问道。美里也显得有些好奇。

"It's your world. We are all here right now because you and Shinji caught Daniel's attention. So we're putting you two in charge of this circus. Once the operation's set up on your world, you tell us what the priorities and targets are. Our officers will command their units and such in combat, but you're the ones telling us where to go," Rayana said. "To that end, we'll be setting you all up with temporary commissions in the Army. You'll be officially Imperial Army officers for the duration of the operation. You two, Kaji, and Misato as First Lieutenants." She dipped her head in an apologetic gesture to Misato. "Sorry about the drop in grade, Major, but your JSSDF commission isn't exactly equivalent to one of ours in years or expectation of abilities, and you've been out of circulation as to the situation on your world for the last several years. So you'll still be Ops boss for them, but top command is the Pilots' prerogative."

这是你的世界。我们此刻齐聚于此，全因你和真嗣吸引了丹尼尔的目光。因此，我们将这场马戏团交由你们两人掌管。一旦在你的世界部署好行动，你们就告诉我们优先事项和目标。我们的军官会在战斗中指挥各自的部队，但你们要指引我们去向何方。雷亚娜说道。为此，我们将授予你们所有人陆军临时委任状。在行动期间，你们将正式成为帝国陆军军官。你俩，加上加持和美里，都将担任一等中尉。她向美里低头致歉，抱歉降了你的级，少校，但你的日本自卫队军衔与我们并不完全等同，无论在年资还是能力预期上，况且你已多年未涉足你所在世界的情况。所以你仍将是他们的行动负责人，但最高指挥权归于驾驶员们。

"Eh, I can deal with that," Misato shrugged. "I trust them a lot more than I trusted Commander Ikari, plus they've got four more years of growing up under their belts. And it's not like you two listened to your 'superior officer' all that much." She gave the two Pilot's an ironic look. Shinji squirmed a bit, recalling some such moments, including his nearly disastrous encounter with the 12th Angel. Only the miracle of his mother's soul aiding his escape had saved him from never returning from the Sea of Dirac. Asuka, never one to be much cowed by Misato's admonitions, stuck her tongue out at her in return.

"哎，这我能应付，" 葛城美里耸了耸肩，"我对他们的信任远超对碇司令的信任，何况他们还多了四年的成长经历。再说，你们俩也没怎么听从过'上级军官'的命令。" 她带着一丝讽刺地看了两位驾驶员一眼。真嗣有些局促不安，回想起一些类似的时刻，包括他与第 12 使徒那场差点致命的遭遇。正是他母亲灵魂的奇迹般帮助，才让他得以从狄拉克之海中逃生，免于一去不返。而明日香，向来不怎么受葛城美里的训诫所慑，反倒是对她吐了吐舌头。

"Okay, maybe not so much on the growing up part," Misato retorted.

"好吧，也许在长大这方面没那么明显。" 美里反驳道。

Shinji shivered internally. 'More 'grown-up' and experienced in the nastiness of the world than we ever wanted to be, Misato. We're both just too used to keeping it hidden and under a mask. You're the closest thing either of us had to a mother for years, and I don't know if we'll ever feel comfortable telling you exactly what the last four years did to us.'

真嗣内心颤抖着。'比我们曾希望的更加'成熟'和深谙世间的丑恶，美里。我们都太习惯于隐藏和戴着面具。多年来，你对我们中的任何一个来说都是最接近母亲的存在，我不知道我们是否能坦然地告诉你过去四年对我们做了什么。'

### Chapter 16 Sharing Burdens & Sins

Shinji poked at the silvery band around his left wrist and shook his head as his wrist reported only the sensation of his fingernail on skin. It was like he wasn't wearing it at all. Rayana had handed each of them an interface band like the one Asuka had been wearing for the last day and explained their use and capabilities to them. Water-, fire-, and impact-proof, powered off their own bioelectricity, able to tie right into their own nervous system with a little training for false video calls or silent communication, capable of near interplanetary range when there were other Imperial communications systems nearby to boost off of, and more, all in an impossibly thin film wrapped around his arm.

真嗣轻触左腕上那圈银色带子，摇头间，手腕只传来指甲触碰皮肤的触感，仿佛他根本没戴着它。雷亚娜将类似明日香佩戴了一天的接口带分发给每个人，并向他们解释了其用途和功能。这些带子防水、防火、抗冲击，依靠自身生物电能驱动，稍加训练便能直接接入神经系统，实现虚拟视频通话或无声交流，在有帝国通讯系统辅助的情况下，其通讯范围可覆盖至近地行星际，种种功能尽藏于缠绕臂间的超薄薄膜之中。

He'd only been playing with it for a few minutes when it buzzed against his skin. He saw 'INCOMING CALL; IKARI GENDO' appear on the display. He angrily stabbed at the red 'REJECT?' button that had appeared underneath. His expression and sharp motion drew Asuka's attention. "My father," he snarled quietly through a twisted mouth. "I don't feel like taking his calls."

他才玩了几分钟，手机就在他皮肤上嗡嗡作响。屏幕上显示出“来电：碇源堂”。他愤怒地戳向下面出现的红色“拒接？”按钮。他那扭曲的表情和急促的动作引起了明日香的注意。“我父亲，”他咬牙切齿地低声说道，“我不想接他的电话。”

"Let him sweat for a while, Shinji, but you should give him a chance eventually," Daniel said.

让他先紧张一会儿，真嗣，但最终你应该给他一个机会，"丹尼尔说。

Shinji shook his head. "Not yet. Not nearly yet. I've had not even a day to deal with the idea that Ayan-... Rei was my sister. Less time than that to actually think about it." He gave Asuka a weak smile. "Most of the morning I've had something else on my mind."

真嗣摇了摇头。“还没有，远远没有。我连一天的时间都还没来得及去接受绫波……丽是我妹妹这个事实。实际上，思考这个问题的时间甚至更少。”他向明日香露出一个无力的微笑。“今天上午，我大部分时间都在想别的事情。”

"Pervertierter Dummkopf," Asuka replied, but without the bite it would have had even a week ago. The previous week would not have seen her returning the smile either.

"变态的傻瓜，"明日香回答道，但语气已不如一周前那般尖锐。若在上周，她也不会回以微笑。

"And I'm betting you'd like to have a good deal more time to think about that little topic," Daniel continued. "Think about it, but think about Ayanami-san too. We're going to head back to your world to try contact with her this afternoon."

"我敢打赌，你肯定希望能有更多时间来思考这个小话题，"丹尼尔继续说道，"好好想想，同时也想想绫波小姐。我们打算今天下午回到你的世界去尝试与她联系。"

Shinji felt Asuka stiffen next to him. He did too. "Contact?" he asked, startled.

真嗣感觉到身边的明日香身体一僵，他自己也是如此。“接触到了？”他惊问。

"We've felt her presence a bit when we did the retrievals of your friends. We're going to pick up the rest of the NERV bridge crew, Aida-san, and Suzuhara-san and Horaki-san's families this afternoon. While we're there, we figured it would be a good time to bring you two and Dr. Ikari along and try direct contact with her," Rayana said.

在我们营救你朋友的时候，已经隐约感觉到她的存在了。今天下午，我们将去接剩下的 NERV 指挥室成员，相田先生、铃原先生和洞木先生的家人。既然到了那里，我们觉得这是个好时机，带上你们两位和碇博士，尝试与她直接接触。”雷亚娜说道。

"Why me?" Asuka asked. "Shinji and Dr. Ikari I can see, but why me too?"

"为什么是我？" 明日香问道，"我能理解真嗣和碇博士，但为什么也包括我？"

"I have a very strong feeling this conversation will involve you too, Asuka. You'll be one more familiar face for her to see. She may want to talk to you too."

我有种强烈的感觉，这次谈话也会牵涉到你，明日香。你将是她能见到的又一个熟悉面孔。她可能也想和你谈谈。

"It's not like Wondergirl and I had much to say to each other the last time we saw each other, or that she was ever that talkative in the first place. Whatever. When?" Asuka shrugged.

上次见到奇迹女孩时，我和她之间也没什么好说的，她本来就不是多话的人。无所谓了。什么时候？”阿苏卡耸了耸肩。

"A bit after lunch. There's no need for rushing right now. The whole point of bringing you all here to Avalon was to give you a chance to decompress and relax. You've had years of events tossing you around like papers in a storm. Now's your chance for a honest holiday and a chance to decide what is going to happen next, instead of it just happening to you. And you might have more to say to Ayanami-san than you think, Asuka. When Commander Ikari tried to order her to begin the Third Impact on his instructions, you know what she said to him?" Daniel asked her.

午餐后不久，此刻无需匆忙。带你们所有人来到阿瓦隆的全部意义，就是给你们一个放松和减压的机会。你们经历了多年如同风暴中纸片般被事件抛来抛去的日子。现在，是时候真正享受一个假期，并决定接下来会发生什么，而不是任由事情发生在自己身上。而且，明日香，你可能比想象中更有话要对绫波说。当碇司令试图命令她按照他的指示引发第三次冲击时，你知道她对他说了什么吗？”丹尼尔问她。

Asuka shook her head. "I was kind of busy at that point, dealing with SEELE's own little play in that direction." She looked at Shinji. "I'm still not ready to give you a pass on that one, Shinji."

明日香摇了摇头。“那时候我有点忙，正应付着 SEELE 在那方面的自导自演。”她看向真嗣，“我还是不打算就此放过你，真嗣。”

He winced. 'Yeah, I don't think I'm ready to be forgiven for that either, Asuka. You don't have to rub it in thou-'

他皱了皱眉。“是啊，我也不认为我值得被原谅，明日香。你不必再强调这一点——”

"But I'm getting closer. You've got the rest of our lives to watch my back. That ought to give you a chance to make up for costing me my last one." She missed Shinji's shocked look as she turned her face back to Daniel. "So what did she say that was so important?"

但我正逐渐接近。你还有余生来为我守望。这应该给你机会弥补让我失去上一个的过失。"她没看到真嗣震惊的表情，转而面向丹尼尔，"那么，她到底说了什么这么重要？"

Rayana gave Asuka's little aside a raised eyebrow, but answered, "When he ordered her to do what he wanted, what he'd created her for and raised her for, to the pathetic extent that he did, anyway, Ayanami-san told him 'I am not your doll.' Then she gave control to Shinji instead. Sound familiar?"

绫波对明日香的小声嘀咕挑了挑眉，但还是回答道：“当他命令她做他想让她做的事，做他创造她、培养她所为的那点可怜的事时，绫波小姐告诉他‘我不是你的玩偶。’然后她把控制权交给了真嗣。听起来熟悉吗？”

Asuka blinked. "She said what?"

明日香眨了眨眼。“她说什么了？”

Daniel cocked his head. "It may not have been as direct an effect as her conversations with Shinji, but you did influence the First Child more than you might have thought. She listened more than you'd guess. There have been worlds where you two got along much better when you reached out to her, too. There have even been worlds where she specifically adopted you as her role model on how to dress like, walk like, and act like a normal teenage girl since she decided you were the most impressive example of such she knew of." He laughed. "Your eyes almost popped out of your head the first time you watched her dress fashionably and strut down the street like you do, absolutely confident in your looks and your attitude. The fact she walked up to Shinji and gave him a hug almost made you contemplate strangling her for...um, 'touching your stuff', as you put it. She ended up fairly happy dating Aida-san, actually."

丹尼尔侧了侧头。“虽然可能不像她与真嗣的对话那样直接，但你确实对第一适格者的影响比你想象的要大。她比你想象的要听得多。在某些世界里，当你向她伸出援手时，你们俩相处得更好。甚至在某些世界里，她特意将你作为她的榜样，学习如何像一个普通少女那样穿着、走路和行为，因为她认为你是她所知道的最令人印象深刻的例子。”他笑了起来。“第一次看到她穿着时尚，像你一样自信地走在街上时，你的眼睛几乎要瞪出来了。她走到真嗣面前给他一个拥抱，几乎让你考虑要勒死她，因为你觉得她‘碰了你的东西’，就像你说的那样。实际上，她最终和相田先生约会时相当幸福。”

Asuka looked surprised but accepting until the end of that news. "Ok, now that's even less believable. Wondergirl and the nerdiest Stooge are probably the two people in the world least likely to ever get a date, let alone with each other. Once more, somebody was walking around in a dream there."

明日香看起来既惊讶又接受了这个消息，直到最后。"好吧，这更难以置信了。奇迹女孩和最书呆子的笨蛋可能是世界上两个人最不可能约会的人，更不用说彼此了。又一次，有人在梦中漫步了。"

"You'd be surprised at what a variety of things the multiverse can throw up that still contains recognizable analogues of yourselves. I think we'll hold off telling you about any of the more outlandish ones, though I get the feeling if I tell you not to ask, you'll do it anyway. I'll try not to say 'I told you so' if that happens. In any case, we'll head for your world this afternoon. For now, do anything you like. We'll be around should you call, and maybe see you for lunch. Ready, love?" Rayana nodded, and the two waved a goodbye as they walked out the door.

多元宇宙中涌现出的各种事物，仍包含着与你们相似的熟悉影子，这或许会让你感到惊讶。我想，关于那些更为离奇的版本，我们还是暂且不提为妙。尽管我预感，一旦我劝你别问，你反而会追问不休。若真如此，我会尽量忍住不说“我早告诉过你”。无论如何，我们今天下午将前往你的世界。现在，你大可随心所欲。若有需要，我们随时待命，或许午餐时再见。准备好了吗，亲爱的？" 雷亚娜点头回应，两人挥手告别，一同走出了门。

Shinji was still staring at Asuka. It took him a minute to realize that they were now alone again. They'd left Misato and the others at their cabin after the 'campaign conference' broke up, but Daniel and Rayana had come with them back to their own. But now they were alone again, and unlike all the times before it now had all sorts of different possibilities and implications that it hadn't yesterday... especially because now their friends knew it too. Shinji blushed again remembering the amazingly dirty wink Misato had given him as he and Asuka had left. Kaji-san right next to her giving him a thumbs-up hadn't helped.

真嗣依旧凝视着明日香。过了一会儿，他才意识到他们再次独处了。在“作战会议”结束后，他们将美里和其他人留在他们的木屋里，但丹尼尔和蕾雅娜跟着他们回到了自己的住处。然而现在，他们又独处了，与以往任何时候不同，此刻充满了各种不同的可能性和含义，而这些在昨天还不存在……尤其是因为现在他们的朋友们也知道了。回想起美里在他们离开时那令人难以置信的狡黠眨眼，真嗣再次脸红，而旁边的加持先生竖起大拇指的举动更是让他尴尬不已。

"Wondergirl and the geek-Stooge?" Asuka snorted. "And that's not the craziest world they've seen?" Her expression faded into a more perplexed look. "So she was listening to me. She was not a doll at the end after all."

"神奇少女与书呆子斯图奇？"明日香嗤之以鼻。"这还不是他们见过的最疯狂的世界？"她的表情逐渐转为困惑。"这么说她一直在听我说话。她最终并不是一个玩偶。"

"And you may have saved the world again," Shinji said. "You helped convince Rei she wasn't a doll, and me that happiness was worth the risk of pain." He took Asuka's hand again. He was finding doing that, being able to touch her, feel her warm hand against his, was rapidly becoming almost addictive. From the way Asuka quickly grasped his hand in return, he wasn't alone in that feeling.

"或许你又拯救了世界一次，" 真嗣说道，"你帮助丽相信她不是玩偶，也让我明白，为了幸福去冒痛苦的风险是值得的。" 他再次握住明日香的手。他发现，能够触碰她，感受她温暖的手掌紧贴自己的，这种感觉正迅速变得几乎令人上瘾。从明日香迅速回握他的手的动作来看，这种感觉并非他一人独有。

"So..." they both began, and stopped. Shinji paused, then nodded at her to go first.

"那么..." 两人同时开口，又都停了下来。真嗣顿了顿，然后向她点头示意先说。

"So, you go where I go? 'We've spent enough time apart'?" she asked lightly. "Are you a man or a puppy dog, Third?"

所以，你跟我走？“我们已经分开得够久了”？她轻声问道。“你是男人还是小狗，老三？”

"So you're willing to kill so that I don't have to?" he responded, his voice much flatter.

"这么说，你愿意杀人，好让我不必动手？"他回应道，语气平淡了许多。

Asuka's small smile died. "Way to bring down the mood, Third." She looked down at their hands. "Yes. I... I've trained most of my life to fight as a Pilot. I never worried about the choice that I'd made. Not about that part of it, anyway. You were dragged into it by your father, and forced into the Entry Plug by blackmail and desperation. I was ready to slug you during that fight for being so stupid, letting the chance of collateral casualties freeze us in place, and give Winthrop twenty more years to fuck up the world because you wouldn't... I know you don't like it, Shinji, but that's war, and we were the only ones who could have made that coup succeed. Jinnai may only be an improvement by comparison, but I'd still make that choice again. I... know you hate to kill. I... can. So if it comes down to it, I'll take that shot for you."

明日香那抹浅笑消逝了。“真会破坏气氛，三号。”她低头看着他们的手。“是的。我……我大半生都在训练，为了成为一名飞行员而战。我从未担心过自己所做的选择。至少那部分没有。你是被你父亲拖进来的，被勒索和绝望逼进了插入栓。在那场战斗中，我真想揍你一顿，因为你太愚蠢，因为担心附带伤亡而让我们停滞不前，让温索普再多二十年去搞砸这个世界，就因为你不愿意……我知道你不喜欢这样，真嗣，但这就是战争，我们曾是唯一能让那场政变成功的人。即使神无可能只是相比之下有所改进，我仍然会再次做出那个选择。我……知道你厌恶杀人。我……可以。所以如果真到了那一步，我会为你承担那一击。”

"I owe you a life, you offer to take a death in my place... I wish I'd looked more at Taoism than Philosophy of Mind right now," Shinji said, a little sadly. "And as for time apart... yeah, after the last three and a half years... I'm sorry I disappeared that month. I'd have come back sooner if I'd been able to. I didn't know I made you worry so much."

"我欠你一条命，你却愿代我赴死...真希望此刻我更懂些道教而非心学。" 真嗣略带伤感地说道，"至于分别的时光...是啊，经历了过去三年半...抱歉那个月我消失了。若能早些回来，我定会回来。我不知道让你如此担忧。"

"You start in on that philosophy crap and I'll make you disappear again. Yes, you worried me! Who was I supposed to beat to be best Pilot if you vanished, Wondergirl? Come on! I..." her usual arrogance ran out of steam when her eyes drifted to their hands again. "It wouldn't have been the same, alright? And without the Great, Invincible Shinji-sama, who knows how the 13th and 14th Angels would have gone? Or the coup?" Asuka tried to keep the superior tone in her voice, but it faded. "Don't you get killed on me, Third. You still owe me a life, and until you pay me back you're under orders not to die. Not after you say something like you said this morning. Got it?"

你再扯那些哲学废话，我就让你再次消失。是的，你让我担心了！如果你不见了，我该打败谁来成为最棒的飞行员，奇迹女孩？拜托！我……"当她的目光再次落在他们的手上时，她一贯的傲慢气势消散了。"没有你，一切都不会一样，明白吗？没有伟大的、无敌的真嗣大人，谁知道第 13 和 14 使徒会怎样？还有那场政变？"明日香试图保持她那高人一等的语气，但它逐渐减弱了。"别给我死了，第三。你还欠我一条命，在你还清之前，你得听令不准死。尤其是在你今早说了那样的话之后。明白了吗？"

He squeezed her hand. "Understood." He stared at her hands for a moment before he said more quietly, "You... thank you for offering to take that burden for me, Asuka... but... like I said, I can't accept happiness bought with someone else's pain."

他紧握她的手，“明白了。”他凝视着她的双手片刻，然后更轻声地说：“你……谢谢你愿意为我承担那份重担，明日香……但是……就像我说的，我无法接受用他人痛苦换来的幸福。”

Asuka looked a little annoyed. "I'm trying to do something nice for you, baka."

明日香看起来有些恼火。“我这是在为你做好事，笨蛋。”

"I know. Thank you. But I can't ask you to carry my sins for me. I..."

我知道。谢谢你。但我不能让你为我承担罪孽。我……

"I wasn't asking," Asuka said more firmly.

"我不是在请求，"明日香更加坚定地说。

Shinji shook his head. "You can't. More philosophy, I'm sorry. I'm just as guilty of a sin if I'm complicit. If I let you kill in my place, I still have that sin myself, and I've also made you take it on too. I'll never look for a fight with the same eagerness you will, Asuka, but I'll never make you take on my guilt. I promised to watch your back. You're a fighter. I know that I'll have to fight next to you to fulfill my promise. I owe you. If it comes down to it, I think I've decided that your life means more to me than... well, a spotless conscience would be cold comfort. I'll accept what I have to do to make that happen. I'll worry about my own forgiveness after that."

真嗣摇了摇头。“你不能这么做。更多的哲学问题，我很抱歉。如果我默许，我同样有罪。如果我让你替我杀人，我仍然背负着那份罪孽，还让你也承担了它。我永远不会像你那样渴望战斗，明日香，但我永远不会让你承担我的罪责。我承诺过要保护你。你是个战士。我知道，为了履行我的承诺，我必须与你并肩作战。我欠你的。如果真到了那一步，我想我已经决定，你的生命对我来说比……一个清白的良心更为重要。那只会是冷淡的慰藉。我会接受为了实现这一点我必须做的事情。至于我自己的宽恕，之后再去担心吧。”

Asuka just stared at him in amazement. "I don't believe you, Third. You try to turn down my offer to take on something you hate, throw more of your damn philosophy at me, yet still manage to make it sound noble and tie it to your promise to never desert me. I've never seen anyone else who can brood at me like it's a Gottdamn superpower!"

明日香只是惊讶地盯着他。“我不相信你，老三。你试图拒绝我让你接受你讨厌的事情，又向我灌输你那该死的哲学，却仍能将其说得高尚，并与你永不抛弃我的承诺联系起来。我从没见过有人能像你这样，把忧郁当成天赐的超能力来对我！”

"I'm sor—" He cut off at her warning look that was edging toward a glare. "I... l-love you, Asuka. I won't add to your own burdens to carry. I will help you carry yours."

"我很抱——" 他话未说完，便在她逐渐转为怒视的警告眼神中住了口。"我...我-我爱你，明日香。我不会给你增添负担。我会帮你分担你的重担。"

"Baka-Shinji, the perpetual hero-martyr. Just remember you're not allowed to get killed, baka. And-" She stopped abruptly and colored a bit. "This is going to take getting used to. And you keep saying that. I like hearing it."

"八嘎真嗣，永远的英雄殉道者。记住，你不许死，笨蛋。还有——"她突然停下，脸上泛起红晕。"这需要时间适应。而你总是这么说。我喜欢听。"

Shinji essayed a small smile. "What, 'I'm sorry'?"

真嗣尝试着挤出一个微笑。“什么，‘对不起’？”

"Baka! I... like hearing it, and... I'm pretty sure I'm going to need all the reminders I can get. And... and... you're damn well holding me tonight, Third Child! I don't want more nightmares!"

"笨蛋！我...喜欢听这个，而且...我敢肯定我需要尽可能多的提醒。还有...还有...你今晚绝对要抱着我，第三适格者！我不想再做噩梦了！"

"Anything you want, Asuka. Those I'll gladly take from you."

你想要什么，明日香，我都会欣然接受。

"You take what I give you, and give me everything I want, that was the arrangement," she agreed. "And now what I want is... is... I want you to..." Shinji watched her swallow, and fought down the impulse to do the same. Sometimes the legacy of their synchronization training had strange effects. His hand was sure shaking in time with hers in their joined grip.

"你接受我给予的，给我我想要的一切，这是我们的约定，"她同意道。"而现在我想要的是...是...我希望你..." 真嗣看着她吞咽，努力抑制住自己也想这么做的冲动。有时他们的同步训练留下的影响真是奇怪。他的手在与她紧握中，确实在同步颤抖。

"I want you to hold me," Asuka finally finished in a mumble.

"我想让你抱抱我。"明日香终于含糊地说完了。

'She wants me to... okay, we're through the looking glass now, Ikari. This is starting to be even weirder and more terrifying than Instrumentality was.' Shinji did gulp now, and somewhat to his own surprise tugged on her hand to pull Asuka closer against him.

她想让我……好吧，碇，我们现在是透过镜子了。这开始变得比人类补完计划还要诡异和恐怖。”这次，真嗣确实咽了口唾沫，并且有点出乎自己意料地拉了拉她的手，把明日香拉得更靠近自己。

Apparently Asuka hadn't expected that move either, and 'eep'-d slightly in surprise as she was pulled over to thump against his chest. Shinji broke their grip and wrapped his arms around her. 'Again.' He thought. 'Just a bit more adrenalin involved than last time, though.' Asuka had to be just as aware of his jackhammering heartbeat with her head against his chest like that. Both of them froze as his arms settled into place. After a long, tense pause, he felt her slowly relax and adjust herself to lie more comfortably.

显然，明日香也没料到这一招，被拉过去撞在他胸口时，她轻声“咦”了一下，显得有些惊讶。真嗣松开握着的手，转而将她紧紧拥入怀中。“再来一次。”他心想，“只是这次比上次多了点肾上腺素。”明日香的头紧贴着他的胸膛，一定也能感受到他那如擂鼓般剧烈的心跳。两人都僵住了，直到他的手臂稳稳地环抱住她。经过一段紧张的沉默后，他感觉到她渐渐放松下来，调整姿势让自己躺得更舒服些。

"That's better, Th-... Shinji. Good boy." Asuka's voice was trying for a brash, arrogant note, but the increasing blush on her face beat that back into a half-hearted softer tone.

“这样好多了，Th-... 真嗣。好孩子。”明日香试图用一种傲慢自大的语气说话，但她脸上越来越红的羞涩将这种语气压了回去，变成了一种半心半意的柔和声调。

'Oh gods, she feels warm and... soft.' He fractionally loosened his arms around her for a second when he felt her own arms wiggle around his own sides and clamp on fiercely.

'哦，天哪，她感觉温暖又……柔软。' 当他感觉到她的手臂绕过他的两侧，紧紧地环抱住他时，他微微松开了环绕她的双臂。

"Um..." he said hesitantly after another taught pause.

“嗯……”在又一次紧张的停顿后，他迟疑地说道。

"Just... shut up and stay put, baka. That's... that's an order."

就...闭嘴待着，笨蛋。这是...这是命令。

"Yes, Asuka." 是的，明日香。

Part 29 第二十九章

Two Pairs, Full House 两对，满堂红

Elsewhere, two other young people were having an entire extended and hesitant negotiation session without a single word. Or even looking at each other, for that matter.

在别处，另外两个年轻人正在进行一场漫长而犹豫的谈判，全程未发一言。甚至，他们连看都没看对方一眼。

Touji Suzuhara sat on the couch in the small house on the beach they'd been told was theirs for as long as they needed and desperately tried to get his leg to stop bouncing. He wasn't winning the fight, but staring at his knee was a lot easier than looking less than a meter to his right and trying to keep his flaming red face pointed at his former Class Representative Hikari Horaki. The fact she seemed to be likewise engaged in a silent starting contest with her own lap didn't even register on his mind, which had been busily whirring over a single paralyzing thought since he regained consciousness.

铃原冬二坐在那栋海边小屋的沙发上，被告知这房子他们可以随意使用多久。他拼命想让不停抖动的腿停下来，却未能如愿。盯着膝盖发呆总比向右看要容易得多，因为那里不足一米处，他正试图让自己的脸不要那么通红，对着曾经的班长洞木光。她似乎也在与自己的膝盖进行无声的对视比赛，这一事实甚至未曾进入他的脑海，自从他恢复意识以来，他的思绪就一直被一个令人瘫痪的念头占据着。

True, the thought had been pushed to the back of his head while Shinji and the Red Demon filled them in on what had been going on in their world since the incomprehensible strangeness of the Third Impact had swallowed them all up. The immediately following discussion on joining in the war to set their battered world right had added a host of new questions to answer, but once their strange hosts and his two classmates had left, the first question had reasserted itself.

确实，当真嗣和红魔向他们详细叙述自那令人费解的第三次冲击将他们全部吞噬以来，他们的世界所发生的一切时，这个念头被暂时搁置了。紧接着关于加入战争以纠正他们满目疮痍的世界的讨论，又带来了一连串新的问题需要解答。但当他们那奇特的主人和两位同学离开后，最初的问题再次浮现心头。

The spectacle of himself and the Class Rep sitting on the couch and blushing furiously while they both tried to work up the nerve to even look at each other had left Major Katsuragi in stitches while Kaji-san had tried to hold her up.

他和班长坐在沙发上，满脸通红，两人都鼓起勇气才敢互相看一眼，这一幕让葛城少校笑得前仰后合，而加持先生则试图扶住她。

After she finally got control of herself, at least to the point of only occasional giggles, Major Katsuragi had wiped at her eyes and sat down on the couch across the cocktail table from them.

在终于控制住自己，至少偶尔才发出几声轻笑后，葛城美里少校擦了擦眼睛，坐到了他们对面的沙发上，中间隔着一张鸡尾酒桌。

"So, I'm going to go waaaay out on a limb here and guess that what Rayana told me about how Asuka knocked you two out with one shot was accurate," she asked with great amusement. The intensification of their blushes was all the answer she needed to start snickering again. "Hee hee hee! Oh, you kids are hilarious! Even more fun than those two! Here's some relationship advice; talk-" She swatted at Kaji when he started to laugh at her saying that. "Quiet! And grab me a beer! Talk to each other, don't hold back, be careful, and if you can't be careful, name it after me."

所以，我打算大胆猜测一下，雷亚娜告诉我的关于明日香一击就把你们俩打晕的事应该是真的，"她带着极大的乐趣问道。他们脸红的加深就是她需要的全部答案，让她又开始咯咯笑起来。"嘻嘻嘻！哦，你们这些孩子真有趣！比那两个还有趣！这里有些恋爱建议；说话——"当她说到这里时，她拍了拍开始笑起来的卡吉。"安静！给我拿瓶啤酒！互相交流，别藏着掖着，要小心，如果做不到小心，就以我的名字命名吧。"

Hikari looked like she was thinking about passing out again. Touji was about to vote in favor of that himself. Misato started cracking up again, but cooled down suddenly as Kaji-san pressed a beer into her lifted hand.

光看起来又要晕过去了。冬二自己也差点投赞成票。这时，美里又开始笑起来，但突然间，随着卡吉先生将一瓶啤酒塞进她举起的手中，她又冷静了下来。

"Now," she began, "besides that, it sounds like they won't need just another Pilot, Suzuhara-kun, so you don't have to jump in on this if you don't want to. But I'm sure Shinji-kun would appreciate having a friend he trusts fighting with him." Her completely composed and cool Operations Officer persona was a stunning switch for Touji, but it helped calm his blushing as he turned his thinking back to less...confusing matters.

“现在，”她开口道，“除此之外，听起来他们不只是需要另一个飞行员，铃原君，所以如果你不愿意，不必非得参与进来。但我相信，真嗣君会很高兴有一个他信任的朋友与他并肩作战。”她那完全镇定自若、冷静的操作员形象，对东治来说是一个惊人的转变，但这有助于平复他因思绪重回不那么令人困扰的事情而泛起的脸红。

"I...yeah, I know Shinji would like a buddy in a fight, but I wasn't so hot in my only shot at it," Touji said slowly. "And the Class Rep...I mean, I don' wanna see her have to go into a fight like that. She might get hurt, and I really don' wanna see that! She's too prett-Um..." His blush slightly returned.

“我……嗯，我知道真嗣在战斗中需要个伴，但我那次机会表现并不出色，”东治缓缓说道，“至于班长……我是说，我不想看到她不得不参与那样的战斗。她可能会受伤，我真的不想看到那一幕！她太漂亮了——呃……”他的脸颊微微泛红。

"Looks like you two really need to talk this out. Okay! Kaji, we're outta here!" Misato said cheerfully and stood up.

看来你们俩真的需要好好谈谈。好的！卡嘉，我们走吧！” 惣流·明日香·兰格雷开心地说着，站起身来。

"What? Where are you going? You're going to leave us alone?" Hikari asked apprehensively.

"什么？你要去哪儿？你要丢下我们不管吗？" 光不安地问道。

"You two aren't going to be able to make a good decision until you can at least look at each other. So my fiancé," she trilled the word, "and I are going to go back to our cabin and play 'Who gets tired first?', and you two are going to sit here until you talk to each other. Call us later when you've made up your minds as to what you want to do. Apart from each other, that is." The blushes returned full strength.

你们俩要是不肯正视对方，就别想做出什么明智的决定。所以呢，我的未婚夫——她故意把这个词说得抑扬顿挫——和我打算回我们的船舱玩“谁先累趴下”的游戏，而你们俩就坐这儿，直到愿意开口交流为止。等你们想清楚了要怎么做，再给我们打电话吧。当然，我是说除了彼此之外的事。两人的脸颊再次涨得通红。

She and her lover departed, still laughing. After a long, even more embarrassed interval, Touji finally turned his head to find Hikari already staring at him. "Class Re-"

她和情人离去时依旧笑语盈盈。经过一段更长的、愈发尴尬的沉默后，冬二终于转过头，发现光早已凝视着他。“班级重...”

"You think I'm pretty?" she asked him quietly.

"你觉得我漂亮吗？" 她轻声问他。

"Um...um...um...yes?" He coughed and tried again "Yes."

"呃...呃...呃...是的？" 他咳嗽一声，再次尝试道："是的。"

Hikari sat silently for a moment. "Suzuhara Touji-san, I have been trying to get you to ask me out for months. If you think I'm pretty, why didn't you say anything?"

光静静地坐了一会儿。“铃原东治先生，这几个月来我一直试图让你约我出去。如果你觉得我漂亮，为什么不说出来呢？”

Touji looked anywhere but in her eyes. "Um...I'm no good at talkin' to girls."

冬二目光四处游移，就是不敢看她的眼睛。“呃……我不太会跟女孩子说话。”

"And I'm no good at talking to boys," Hikari replied. "That's why I tried to get you to talk to me; making you lunch, offering to go with you to deliver papers to Ayanami-san's home, and such."

"我对和男生聊天也不在行，" 光回答道，"所以我才想方设法让你跟我说话，比如给你做便当，提议陪你一起去给绫波小姐送文件之类的。"

"I...um...I kinda guessed...somethin' like that. I was gonna talk to you after the Eva test, but...y'know how that went."

我...呃...我有点猜到了...类似的事情。我本打算在 Eva 测试后和你谈谈，但...你知道那情况怎么了。

Hikari nodded, and scooted a little closer to him. "Touji...do you think that was a little mean, how Asuka...umm...mumble mumble mum..."

光点了点头，稍微向他挪近了一些。“冬二……你觉得那样是不是有点过分，就是明日香她……呃……咕哝咕哝咕……”

"Um...yeah, it was, I guess...um..so...how do you..."

"呃...是的，我想是吧...呃...那么...你怎么..."

Hikari rallied, and went on much more assuredly, "So...if we're both bad at talking...I have an idea about what we can do next."

光鼓起勇气，更加自信地说：“那么……既然我们都不擅长交谈……我有个关于接下来我们可以做什么的想法。”

"What kind of..." Hikari slid her hand into his lap and took his hand in hers. He swallowed nervously. "...idea?" he ended in a soprano squeak.

"什么样的..." 光将手滑入他的膝间，握住了他的手。他紧张地咽了咽口水。"...想法？" 他以一种尖细的颤音结束了问话。

Hikari smiled wickedly. Touji shivered, in fear or anticipation, he wasn't sure.

光邪恶地笑了。透二颤抖着，是恐惧还是期待，他自己也说不清楚。

Asuka was losing an argument with herself, and it was great.

明日香正在和自己争论，而且这感觉棒极了。

She was lying comfortably, and had been for at least an hour, in Shinji's arms. 'This is humiliating. It's the fucking Third Child, the spineless, useless wimp! He's not a man, he's a fucking sponge, a parasite!' Except he'd sworn never to desert her again, and pledged her a life for the one his paralysis had cost her.

她舒适地躺在真嗣的怀里，已经至少一个小时了。'这太丢脸了。他是那个该死的第三适格者，一个软弱无用的懦夫！他不是男人，他就是个该死的海绵，一个寄生虫！' 然而，他发誓再也不会抛弃她，并承诺用一生来偿还他因瘫痪而夺走她的那段生命。

He was so warm, and holding her. 'You don't need this! This is stupid! He's just using you to make himself feel better!' Except she was the one feeling better, and using him to keep the nightmares at bay.

他如此温暖，拥抱着她。“你不需要这个！这太愚蠢了！他只是利用你来让自己感觉好些！”然而，真正感觉好转的是她，她利用他来抵御噩梦的侵袭。

He'd taken her hand unprompted and confirmed in front of their best friends that he had in fact confessed his love for her that very morning. 'He's lying! He's just saying that so you'll be nice to him! He doesn't care about you, he just wants anyone who'll coddle and comfort him! Except he had said it was her and only her that he looked to in the end. He'd gone on after Touji, Rei, Kaworu and even Misato had been lost to him. Losing her had broken his mind.

他未经提示便牵起了她的手，在他们最好的朋友面前证实，他确实在那天早上向她表白了爱意。'他在撒谎！他只是这么说，好让你对他好一点！他不在乎你，他只是想要一个能溺爱和安慰他的人！' 然而他曾说过，最终他只看向她，只有她。在失去了东治、丽、薰甚至美里之后，他继续前行。失去她，却让他心智崩溃。

He'd called her beautiful and kissed her. 'He thought he was dreaming! You know what he'd do if he thought you were asleep! He'd take every filthy advantage of you he could!' Except he hadn't. He'd been sleeping next to her for a month, and hadn't touched her at all except for their one failed attempt. He didn't even especially ogle her when she dressed.

他曾赞美她美丽，并吻了她。'他以为自己在做梦！你知道如果他以为你睡着了会怎么做！他会趁机占尽你的便宜！'然而他并没有。他已在她身边睡了一个月，除了那次失败的尝试外，他根本没有碰过她。就连她更衣时，他也没有特别地盯着她看。

And he'd stopped because he was hurting her. 'He doesn't want you! You're a filthy whore!' Except he'd had a really hard time keeping his eyes off her legs and chest this morning when he thought she wasn't looking. And he'd plain said he wanted her when she asked.

他停了下来，因为他弄疼了她。“他不要你了！你就是个肮脏的妓女！”可今早他以为她没注意时，却着实费了好大劲才没让自己的目光在她腿上和胸前游移。而且当她问起时，他直截了当地说过他想要她。

He smelled kind of spicy-musky, and it was getting absolutely intoxicating. 'No he doesn't! It's...It's...you're imagining it! They fucked with your brain at that clinic! He's just the fucking Third Child! He's just a man like Winthrop and Jinnai! He'll just use you and discard you when he loses interest, just like everyone else!' Except no, not like them. Very much not like them, in fact. She knew he'd never do anything to her that she didn't want him to, and would happily accept anything she wanted to do to him. And some parts of her were getting very, very interested in that idea. This time there was no cold water or question about who she was dealing with to cool her down. And she was rapidly losing the argument that she shouldn't be thinking about doing any of those things.

他身上散发着一种辛辣而麝香的味道，愈发令人陶醉。“不，他没有！这是……这是……你在幻想！那家诊所对你的大脑动了手脚！他不过是那个该死的第三子！他和温思罗普、金井一样，只是个男人！他也会像其他人一样，一旦失去兴趣就会利用你然后抛弃你！但不对，并不像他们。实际上，完全不像他们。她知道他永远不会对她做她不愿意的事，也会欣然接受她想对他做的任何事。她内心的一部分对此越来越感兴趣。这次，没有冷水，也没有关于她面对的是谁的疑问来让她冷静下来。她正迅速输掉这场不该去想那些事情的内心辩论。

She'd never exactly even had a sex life. She'd been just starting to think about such things when she'd headed straight into the Angel War. Her attempt to get Kaji to help her out there one buzzed night on the Over The Rainbow had been gently declined by him. She'd had just one kiss in her life that didn't make her want to wash her mouth out with disinfectant, which made it only sadder that she actually had. And her tentative hints to the Third Child had been missed when she aimed too high for his education level, or mistaken his panicked, oxygen-deprived paralysis for rejection. Learning just this morning that he'd have enthusiastically responded if she'd just grabbed him instead of running out of the room was hugely frustrating. How differently would their lives have gone if there'd just been that little deviance from the world they knew?

她从未真正有过性生活。当她直奔天使战争时，才刚刚开始思考这些事情。有一次在彩虹之上的一晚，她试图让卡吉帮忙，却被他婉拒了。她一生中只有一次接吻没有让她想用消毒剂漱口，这反而更让人感到悲哀。她对第三适格者的试探性暗示要么因她对他的教育水平期望过高而未被察觉，要么被误认为是对他因恐慌和缺氧而导致的瘫痪的拒绝。今早得知，如果她当时不是跑出房间而是直接抓住他，他会热情回应，这让她感到极大的挫败。如果他们的世界稍有偏离，他们的生活又会有多么不同呢？

Her 'sex life' had gone downhill from there. A despairing and nearly grief-mad Third Child jerking off over her catatonic body in the hospital before the final battle of NERV had been the high point before the years that came after of being the subject of Winthrop's and Jinnai's 'attentions', attentions that were only technically not rape because of her barely, never-actually-asked-for silent acquiescence.

自那以后，她的“性生活”便每况愈下。在 NERV 最终战役前夕，绝望至近乎悲痛欲绝的三号少年在医院里对着她那僵直的身躯自慰，竟成了之后数年中的高潮——那几年，她成了温斯洛和阵内“关注”的对象，这些行为仅因她那几乎未曾明确要求、始终沉默的默许，才勉强算不上强奸。

But now that was gone, undone in a still not-fully-processed miracle. Her body was hers and hers alone again. She could do what she wanted with it. And Shinji would do whatever she wanted of him. Five years of nearly destroyed sex drive and teenage hormones was coming back at her with a vengeance. She now had available to her a large bed, privacy, and carte blanche from a willing, free, and (though she couldn't think of anything that would make her admit it out loud) not entirely unattractive partner.

但如今，这一切已不复存在，在一个尚未完全理解其奇迹的静默中消散。她的身体再次完全属于她自己，她可以随心所欲地支配。而真嗣，将任她差遣。五年来几乎被摧毁的性欲和青春期的荷尔蒙正以复仇之势回归。现在，她拥有了一张大床、私密的空间，以及一个愿意、自由且（尽管她不愿承认，但确实）并非全无魅力的伴侣所给予的全权委托。

She had secured her place as a Pilot. She had her Mama. She had Shinji. She had the open-ended backing of people who had offered her anything she asked for. She could do whatever she wanted. She was free. The thought struck her with almost physical force. Shinji's arms around her notwithstanding, she felt like she was floating...no, flying. ''Jump off the edge, never worry about the fall', eh? I think I'm starting to like this.' She felt marvelously relaxed and yet at the same time energized. She was feeling...her eyes got wide.

她已稳坐飞行员之位，有母亲相伴，有真嗣相依，更有那些愿意满足她一切要求的人给予的无条件支持。她可以随心所欲，自由自在。这个念头如重击般袭来，即便真嗣的怀抱环绕着她，她仍感觉自己仿佛在漂浮……不，是在飞翔。“跃出边缘，无需忧虑坠落”，是吗？我开始喜欢这种感觉了。她感到无比放松，同时又充满活力。她感受到……她的眼睛睁得大大的。

She was starting to feel like she had on the beach.

她开始感觉自己仿佛置身于海滩。

Now her pulse kicked into fifth gear. '...well, Rayana did promise.' some tiny portion of her mind noted absently. She was feeling like she had on the beach...and her arms were now already around Shinji. So what did she want to do next? 'I can do anything I want...so what do I want?' she thought tensely. 'I...I want...more.' Decision firmed in her breast. She loosened her hands from behind Shinji and slid them and herself higher, bringing his face to a level closer to hers.

此刻，她的心跳骤然加速，如同换上了五档。'......毕竟，雷亚娜确实承诺过。' 她脑海中一小部分漫不经心地提醒着。她感觉自己仿佛回到了海滩上......而她的双臂已经环抱住了真嗣。接下来她想做什么呢？'我可以随心所欲......那我到底想要什么？' 她紧张地思索着。'我......我想要......更多。' 决心在胸中坚定。她松开环抱真嗣的双手，带着自己向上挪动，将他的脸庞拉近至与自己平视的高度。

Shinji had looked down in surprise as her arms loosened and she moved higher against him. "Asuka?"

真嗣惊讶地低头，只见她的手臂松开了，她更紧地贴向他。“明日香？”

When her head was even with his she locked eyes with him from inches away. "Baka-Shinji, haven't you been listening today?" she said softly.

当她的头与他齐平时，她从咫尺之遥与他四目相对。“八嘎真嗣，你今天没在听吗？”她轻声说道。

Shinji just looked confused. "Y-yes, Asuka!" His eyes were really a very nice dark blue, like deep, cool water just begging you to jump in on a hot day...Um! Focus!

真嗣看起来一脸困惑。“是-是的，明日香！”他的眼睛真是非常漂亮的深蓝色，就像炎炎夏日里诱人跃入的深邃清凉水域...呃！集中注意力！

"When someone kisses you, you're supposed to hold them!" she said more sharply.

当有人吻你时，你应该抱住他们！" 她更加尖锐地说道。

"Um...I am?" "呃...是我吗？"

"And it goes the other way too," she said softly again. 'There, let's see what you make of that, baka-Shinji...and I hope you don't miss this 'little signal', or I'm throwing you into the lagoon for sure.'

"而且反过来也是一样，"她再次轻声说道。'那里，让我们看看你对此有何反应，笨蛋真嗣……希望你别错过这个'小信号'，否则我肯定把你扔进泻湖里。'

Shinji's eyes got a lot wider. They searched hers wildly for any sign of manipulation, a trick, finally settling to meet her gaze with intense focus. She felt his hands slide up her back. She felt one slide behind her head and press her closer. She felt his lips meet hers. She felt every nerve on her body light up.

真嗣的眼睛睁得更大了。他急切地在她的眼中寻找任何操纵的迹象，一个诡计，最终定下心来，以强烈的专注与她对视。她感觉到他的手沿着她的背滑上来。她感觉到一只手滑到她脑后，将她拉得更近。她感觉到他的唇与她的相触。她感觉到全身的每一根神经都亮了起来。

She felt like she was soaring.

她感觉自己仿佛在翱翔。

### Chapter 17 Earning What You Deserve

Asuka lounged on the soft couch and tried not to giggle. 'I can't believe I've just spent the last two hours making out with the Third Child. Wheee! Oh God, this is better than being drunk! Wait, being drunk is pretty fun too...note to self; sample what making out while buzzed feels like tonight!' She felt fairly dizzy already. Of course, much more of this and she was going to need to change her underwear pretty soon. She hadn't been this turned on in years, maybe ever.

明日香慵懒地躺在柔软的沙发上，努力忍住不笑出声。'真不敢相信，我居然和第三适格者亲热了整整两个小时。哇哦！天哪，这比喝醉了还要爽！等等，喝醉了也挺好玩的...记下来，今晚得试试微醺时亲热是什么感觉！'她已经感到相当晕眩了。当然，再这样下去，她很快就得换内裤了。她已经好几年，甚至可能从未如此兴奋过。

The two of them would probably still be going at it if their growling stomachs hadn't made themselves heard. They'd oh-so-reluctantly parted to allow Shinji to rise and cook them something to eat in the kitchen. It may not have been midday yet, but it was certainly twelve o'clock, and whatever plans there were in store for 'lunchtime', they were hungry now. Asuka idly wondered how the locals dealt with it. Were two meals before and after midday normal? One really big meal at noon? Or did being Homo Avalonis mean they didn't need to eat so much period? 'And who knew you could work up such an appetite with just your mouth and hands?' she thought with a lazy smile. Turns out the Third Child's hands were pretty good at setting her neck and back on fire in a nice, tingling way, just tracing random patterns up and down as they kissed.

若非腹中雷鸣抗议，两人或许仍沉浸其中。他们颇为不舍地分开，让真嗣起身去厨房准备食物。虽未至正午，时针却已指向十二，无论午餐有何安排，此刻他们饥肠辘辘。明日香闲思，当地人如何应对？是正午前后各一餐，还是正午一顿大餐？抑或身为亚瓦隆人，本就不需过多进食？她带着慵懒的笑意暗想：“谁知仅凭口与手便能激起如此食欲？”原来，第三适格者的双手在亲吻间随意游走于她颈背，竟能带来一阵阵令人愉悦的酥麻。

Three days ago, there'd been nothing. She'd had the prospect of one more campaign, hardly a fight, as the mere appearance of her mostly functional MP Eva would likely have frightened whatever warlords ran their petty fiefdoms in South America into submission just by coming over the hill. One more day in the sun as the mighty Evangelion Pilot, then nothing, the Dummy Plugs sure to replace her as soon as they were operational. Jinnai had ample reason to think that if the Pilots were willing to overthrow one UN Chairman, they might not be so hard to persuade to do the same to a second. If she was unlucky, Jinnai would just have her shot. If she was lucky, she'd be shuffled off to some gaudy, pointless job title that would have meant nothing at all of any meaning would be allowed to come near her for the rest of her life. Shinji would get tired of their arrangement and leave. And she'd be left alone with every filthy, mocking memory of a life that she'd sacrificed her soul to keep afloat for just a handful of years past the end of the world and the entire human race getting to see what she looked like inside.

三天前，一切还是空白。她本以为还能再经历一次战斗，其实算不上真正的战斗，只要她那多半功能正常的 EVA 单位 Eva 一露面，就足以吓得南美那些小打小闹的军阀们望风而降。再享受一天作为强大福音战士驾驶员的荣耀，然后便是一片虚无，待 Dummy Plugs 一上线，她注定会被取代。金井有充分的理由认为，既然驾驶员们愿意推翻一位联合国主席，那么说服他们再推翻第二个也不会太难。如果她不幸，金井可能会直接将她处决。如果她幸运，她会被调到一个华而不实、毫无意义的职位上，从此任何有意义的事物都将与她无缘。真嗣终会厌倦他们的关系而离去。而她，将独自面对那些肮脏、嘲讽的记忆，那是她为了在末日之后、整个人类得以窥见她内心真容的短短几年里，牺牲灵魂所维系的生活。

Now... she had everything. A bigger, badder, wilder mecha than ever. Crowds cheering her name. Her body healed of every scar and blemish. Her purity reclaimed. Her mother restored. Her last campaign re-imagined not as a pathetic swan-song for her brief career as a Pilot, but as the mere beginning of the liberation and rebuilding of her whole world. And a boy who looked at her, swore to her, held her, and told her he loved her. A world without any shadows left that she could not erase.

如今……她拥有了一切。比以往更大、更凶猛、更狂野的机甲。人群高呼她的名字。身体上的每一道疤痕和瑕疵都已痊愈。纯洁得以重获。母亲得以复原。她最后的战役被重新构想，不再是她短暂飞行员生涯的悲凉终曲，而是她整个世界解放与重建的序幕。还有一个男孩，他凝视着她，向她发誓，拥抱着她，告诉她他爱她。一个没有任何她无法抹去的阴影的世界。

'A world you don't deserve.'

你不配拥有的世界。

Except perhaps one, it seemed. Asuka suddenly grit her teeth against the vicious wave of self-loathing that tried to crawl back up from where she'd banished it. "No! I do deserve it! It was all taken from me! It's mine! I deserve to be happy! Haven't I suffered enough?" she whispered to herself.

或许只有一个人例外。明日香突然咬紧牙关，对抗着那股试图从她驱逐之地爬回来的自我厌恶的狂潮。“不！我确实应得！这一切都是被夺走的！它是我的！我值得幸福！难道我受的苦还不够吗？”她自言自语道。

'I, I, I! Selfish bitch. The whole world revolves around you? You deserve to be happy because you've suffered? Look around! Who in your world hasn't? Most have suffered worse than you! You have seen people you knew were innocent broken on wheels in the market and all you did was keep your head down! At least the Third Child tried to talk about how that was wrong. You told him to shut up! You're the high and mighty Evangelion Pilot the UN Chairman keeps close because of that ability. Slut. Winthrop or Jinnai, you don't even care what kind of monsters you serve and spread your legs for, as long as you get your little piece of petty luxuries.'

我，我，我！自私的贱人。整个世界都围着你转吗？就因为你受过苦，你就该幸福？看看周围！你世界里的人谁没受过苦？大多数人都比你受的苦更甚！你见过那些你明知无辜的人在市场里被折磨得体无完肤，而你只是低头不语！至少第三适格者试图谈论那是多么错误。你却让他闭嘴！你这个高高在上的福音战士驾驶员，联合国主席因为你的能力而将你紧握在手。荡妇。无论是温斯洛还是阵内，你甚至不在乎你为哪种怪物服务，只要能得到你那点微不足道的奢侈享受。

"Shut up shut up shut up!"

"闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴！"

'Selfish, worthless bitch.'

自私无用的贱人。

Asuka stood up and started for the door. "I'm going to walk around outside for a bit, Shinji. I'll be back before you're done cooking."

明日香站起身，朝门口走去。“我去外面转转，真嗣。你做好饭前我就回来了。”

Shinji looked up at her in a little surprise, but just nodded. "Ok, it'll be about another ten or fifteen more minutes."

真嗣略带惊讶地抬头看向她，只是点了点头。“好的，大概还要十到十五分钟。”

Asuka headed out without another word. She kept her silence until she was out on the sand, at least. ''That's it, Shinji. Run away again,' you sneered at him. Who's running away now, bitch? 'Oh, become one with me, Shinji! Let me hold you! Let me comfort you and be your mommy and fulfill all your emotional needs whenever you feel like it!' you mocked him. Now what are you demanding from him? Now what are you doing? Is that all he means to you? Your own personal Shinji doll? Hold you, love you, make you feel better... you told him he could never understand you? Bullshit! You're afraid he would! He'd know every little thing about you! You're far more guilty of everything you've ever accused him of, you bitch!' "Shut up shut up shut up!"

明日香一言不发地走了出去，至少在踏上沙滩之前，她一直保持着沉默。“就这样，真嗣，再次逃避吧。”你嘲讽地对他说。现在是谁在逃避，贱人？“哦，与我合为一体吧，真嗣！让我拥抱你！让我安慰你，做你的妈妈，随时满足你所有的情感需求！”你嘲弄他。现在你对他有何要求？你现在在做什么？他对你来说就只是这样吗？你个人的真嗣玩偶？拥抱你，爱你，让你感觉更好……你告诉他他永远无法理解你？胡扯！你是害怕他真的会！他会了解你的一切！你对你所指控他的一切，自己更是罪责难逃，贱人！”“闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴！”

"I didn't think I was being too loud, but I'll try to keep it down if you like," Ching drawled from the beach table.

"我倒没觉得自己太吵，不过你要是喜欢，我会尽量小声点。" 青格懒洋洋地从沙滩桌那边说道。

Asuka jumped. "Oh! Um, hello, Ching." She hastily composed her face and shoved her thoughts aside. "I was... um, talking to myself. How... er, how long have you been sitting out here?"

明日香跳了起来。“哦！嗯，你好，青。”她急忙整理了一下表情，把思绪推到一边。“我刚才……嗯，在自言自语。你……呃，你在这里坐了多久了？”

Ching gave her an amused look. "Oh, about an hour. I was coming by to tell you some good news, and all of a sudden I got the strongest feeling I should just sit out here for a bit and not interrupt anything."

青给她一个好笑的眼神。“哦，大概一个小时吧。我本来是顺路来告诉你一些好消息的，突然间就有种很强烈的感觉，觉得应该在外面坐一会儿，不要打扰到什么。”

Asuka felt her cheeks heating up. "A sudden feeling?" she asked skeptically.

明日香感到自己的脸颊开始发烫。“突然的感觉？”她怀疑地问道。

"No, I didn't peek in the window and see you making out with your boyfriend," Ching said with a smile.

"不，我没有偷看窗户，看到你和男朋友亲热，"青笑着说。

Asuka turned fully red, and mumbled something resembling, "He is not my boyfriend! I mean... we haven't talked about it… I don't know."

明日香满脸通红，含糊地嘟囔着：“他不是我男朋友！我的意思是……我们还没谈过这个……我不知道。”

Ching's eyebrows went up and she laughed. "I was kidding! I just got a call from the Emperor to wait outside before I even got close to knocking. He didn't say why, and I didn't ask. I assumed he had a good reason. But judging by the color you just turned, I really hit the bull's-eye. I thought you sounded rather happy this morning when I called! So I take it you did have a good morning?"

青的眉毛一挑，她笑了起来。“我开玩笑的！我还没来得及敲门，皇帝就打电话让我在外面等着。他没说为什么，我也没问。我想他肯定有他的理由。不过看你刚才那脸色，我真是说中了。我早上打电话时，你听起来挺高兴的啊！看来你早上确实过得不错？”

"Um... yes," Asuka said as she took the chair facing Ching. "Shinji woke up holding me, gave me a kiss before he said he was going to make me breakfast in bed, and offered to wash my back if he got back before I was done with the shower."

"嗯...是的，"明日香说着，坐到了面对阿静的椅子上。"真嗣醒来时抱着我，亲了我一下，然后说他要给我做床上早餐，还提出如果他回来得比我洗澡早，就帮我洗背。"

Ching stared at her. "Okay, whiskey tango foxtrot? Are you shitting me? Did you slip him some mind-control aphrodisiacs or something?"

青盯着她。“好吧，威士忌探戈福克斯？你在逗我吗？你是不是给他下了什么心控催情药之类的？”

"Well, when he came back with the breakfast, after I got out of the shower, I asked him if he still meant it. He said he did and he asked me if I wanted him to. I... I told him 'not yet'."

嗯，他带着早餐回来后，我洗完澡出来，就问他是否还是那个意思。他说是的，还问我是否需要他那么做。我……我告诉他“还不用”。

"'Not yet'? What are you waiting for? He's on the thin side, but pretty yummy. Nice firm buns for sure."

"还没？你在等什么？他虽然瘦，但挺可口的。结实的臀部肯定不错。"

The mental image of just how nice Shinji's rear was distracted Asuka for a second. "Um, yes, but we've... never..." She took a steadying breath. "We've had our 'arrangement' for about a month. He's only tried touching me once, and it didn't... go well. I had some bad memories. Daniel helped out with the worst of them yesterday, but Shinji hadn't tried anything since that one time. I... was starting to wonder if he was even interested in me or my body anymore. This morning I finally asked him, and he said yes, he was, but he didn't want to hurt me. That he couldn't hurt me, because it hurt him too. That he was sad when I was sad, happy when I was happy."

光是想象真嗣的臀部有多迷人就让明日香分神了一秒。“嗯，是的，但我们从没……”她深吸一口气稳住情绪，“我们的‘约定’已经持续了一个月。他只尝试过一次触碰我，但那并不顺利。我有些糟糕的回忆。昨天丹尼尔帮我缓解了最严重的部分，但从那次之后真嗣就没再尝试过。我开始怀疑他是否还对我或我的身体感兴趣。今早我终于问了他，他说是的，他确实感兴趣，但他不想伤害我。他说他不能伤害我，因为那样他也会受伤。他说我难过时他也会难过，我快乐时他也会快乐。”

Ching's eyebrows couldn't go any higher. "Whoa. That sounds like..."

青的眉毛简直要飞起来了。“哇。听起来像是……”

"I asked him why he could feel like that, when I'd told him I didn't love him, when I'd pushed him away every time he tried to talk to me, when I refused him when he'd begged for me to help him when the whole world was crushing him into dust. I asked him why, after all that, he could hold me, call me beautiful, and kiss me. It turned out he thought he was dreaming, so he tried to make me happy in his dream. Then he said he'd do it again, now that he knew he was awake. All that, and he still wanted to make me happy. I told him every horrible thing I could think of that I'd done to him for years, every reason why he should walk away from someone like me as fast as he could... and then I asked him if he loved me."

我问他，在我告诉他我不爱他，每次他试图与我交谈时我都推开他，在他苦苦哀求我帮助他，当整个世界将他碾成尘埃时我拒绝了他之后，他怎么还能那样感受。我问他在经历了这一切之后，他怎么还能拥抱我，称我为美丽，并亲吻我。原来他以为自己在做梦，所以在梦中他试图让我快乐。然后他说，既然他知道自己是清醒的，他会再次这样做。所有这些，他仍然想让我快乐。我告诉他我能想到的这些年我对他做的所有可怕的事情，以及他应该尽快远离我这样的人的每一个理由……然后我问他是否爱我。

Ching sat in rapt silence as Asuka reeled off the emotional storm of her morning until she finished. Nothing but the gentle rustling of the palm trees in the breeze sounded after she stopped. Ching couldn't stand the hanging tension, and burst out with "And? What did he say?!"

静坐在一旁，青听着明日香倾诉她早晨的情感风暴，直至她讲完。四周只剩下微风拂过棕榈叶的沙沙声。青无法忍受这悬而未决的紧张气氛，脱口而出：“然后呢？他说了什么？！”

Asuka blinked back threatening happy tears. "He said 'yes'."

明日香眨着眼，忍住即将涌出的幸福泪水。“他说‘愿意’。”

Ching threw her hands in the air. "Halle-freaking-lujah! That's awesome! Then what happened? What did you say?"

青举起双手，欢呼道：“哈利路亚！太棒了！然后呢？你说了什么？”

"...I asked him why." "...我问他为什么。"

"Uh... beg pardon?" Ching blinked in confusion.

"呃... 对不起，您说什么？" 青眨了眨眼，一脸困惑。

"I asked him why." 我问他为什么。

"Ah... what did he say?"

"啊... 他说了什么？"

"That I made him feel alive. That I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. That when he holds me he doesn't care about anything else."

我让他感受到了生命的活力。我是他见过的最美丽的女孩。当他拥抱着我时，他不在乎其他任何事情。

"Wow. Yeah, that sounds like love. So what did you tell him?"

哇，听起来真像是爱情。那你跟他说了什么？

"That it wasn't going to be easy. And I thanked him for not giving up on me. You called right after he told me how he felt. That's why I was so happy."

那就是不会容易。我感谢他没有放弃我。他告诉我他的感受后不久，你就打来了电话。所以我才那么高兴。

Ching grinned at her. "And who wouldn't be after getting a confession of love like that? Then what?"

青对她咧嘴一笑。“听到那样的爱的告白，谁会不高兴呢？然后呢？”

"We went for a walk on the beach until we ran into Daniel and Rayana. He chewed Shinji out a bit for balking at fighting where innocent bystanders might get hurt, even if that lets the enemy win, and then brought out our best friends, Suzuhara and Hikari, that they'd just brought back from our world. Daniel and Rayana asked us all if we were 'in' on being part of the South America operation on our world. Suzuhara and Hikari asked for more time to think about it, but the rest of us were in."

我们在海滩散步时偶遇了丹尼尔和雷安娜。他因为真嗣犹豫在可能伤及无辜旁观者的地方战斗，即使这意味着让敌人得逞，而责备了他一番。随后，他们带来了刚从我们世界带回的我们的挚友——铃原和光。丹尼尔和雷安娜询问我们所有人是否愿意参与我们世界在南美洲的行动。铃原和光请求更多时间考虑，但其余的我们都已决定加入。

"The good news I was coming to tell you was related to that. The medical check I went in for this morning was my final certification. I'm fully medically cleared to return to duty. But since I'm already here and still on convalescent leave, I applied to be part of the op too. I'm going with you guys," Ching said. "But wait, is that all you said to each other?"

我要来告诉你的好消息正是与此相关。今天早上我参加的体检是我最后的认证。我已完全获得医疗许可，可以重返岗位。但既然我已经在这里，而且还在休养假期间，我就申请也参与这次行动。我会和你们一起去的，”青说。“但等等，你们就只说了这些吗？”

It was Asuka's turn to stare in puzzlement. "'Is that all'? Um... I told him that when I kissed him back during the war and ran, I was wishing that he'd held me." She blushed again at the more recent memory of the use she'd put that phrase to. "And he said he wished he'd known enough about the Bible to recognize that I was kind of hinting at him when I mentioned the 'Walls of Jericho' back then, too. I gave him standing orders to hold me and make me feel better in the future when I'm sad. Oh! And he's learned German thanks to your NILS thing, which is... kind of sweet of him." She looked at Ching, who was still waiting like she was supposed to say something else.

轮到明日香困惑地凝视了。"'就这些'？嗯...我告诉他，在战争期间我回吻他并逃跑时，我曾希望他能抱住我。"她再次因最近使用那句话的记忆而脸红。"他还说他希望当时对《圣经》足够了解，能意识到我提到'耶利哥城墙'时是在暗示他。我给他下达了命令，以后当我难过时，他要抱住我，让我感觉好些。哦！还有，多亏了你的 NILS 项目，他学会了德语，这...算是他挺贴心的。"她看着青，后者仍在等待，仿佛她还有话要说。

Ching was actually starting to look a little concerned. "And then you came back here to make out for the next couple of hours?"

青实际上开始显得有些担忧了。“然后你就回来这里，接下来几个小时都在亲热？”

Asuka bristled a little. Who was she to question their 'propriety'? They were adults! "Is there something wrong with what we were doing? I didn't think you'd be as prudish as our Earth about 'unmarried couples'. Hell, you gave us one bed for us yourself!"

明日香略显不悦。她有什么资格质疑他们的“礼节”？他们可是成年人！“我们做的事情有什么问题吗？我没想到你们会像地球上那样对‘未婚情侣’如此保守。天哪，你们自己还给我们安排了一张床呢！”

"That's not what I'm worried about, Asuka. You two want to snog until you swallow each other's tonsils? Shag until you both run out of bodily fluids? Go right ahead. I'm all for that. But I'm concerned about something more important."

那不是我所担心的，明日香。你们俩想亲吻到吞下对方的扁桃体？缠绵到双方都耗尽体液？尽管去吧。我完全赞成。但我担心的是更重要的事情。

"Good, because I happen to be enjoying what we were doing. A lot. The only reason we stopped was we were getting hungry for something to eat besides each other's faces," Asuka said firmly.

"好，因为我恰好很享受我们正在做的事情。非常享受。我们停下来的唯一原因是我们开始饿得想吃点别的，而不是只顾着亲吻对方的脸。" 明日香坚定地说。

"I'm worried about something I didn't hear. What did you tell him?" Ching said calmly.

"我担心我没听到的某件事。你告诉他什么了？" 青平静地说。

"About what?" Asuka asked, still slightly defensive. She felt a little odd that her friend didn't seem happier for her.

"关于什么？"明日香问道，仍然略带戒备。她感到有些奇怪，朋友似乎并没有为她感到更高兴。

"From looking at the stuff in the file on you two, it's not hard to see you've been at the least interested in each other since practically the day you met. After years of some of the most horrible shit dumped on you two that I can imagine, you found the impetus to ask him if he loved you, and he found the courage to say yes, which I bet wasn't easy for either of you. All of which is great to hear...but what did you say back to him?"

从翻阅关于你们俩的档案资料中不难看出，自相遇之日起，你们对彼此至少抱有兴趣。经历了数年我所能想象到的最糟糕的事情后，你鼓起勇气问他是否爱你，而他也有勇气回答是，我敢打赌这对你们俩都不容易。听到这一切真好……但你又是如何回应他的呢？

"I just told you." 我刚告诉过你了。

Ching sighed. "That's what I was afraid of."

青叹了口气。“这正是我所担心的。”

"What are you talking about? How is it bad that he told me he loves me?" Asuka said more sharply.

"你在说什么？他告诉我他爱我，这有什么不好的？" 明日香语气更尖锐地说。

"He's told you he loves you. Have you told him anything like the same?"

他已向你表白了他的爱意。你是否也向他表达了类似的心意呢？

"I..." Asuka froze. "...no. I haven't" 'You haven't. Because you don't. Because you don't deserve him...' whispered in the back of her mind.

"我..." 明日香愣住了。"...不，我没有。" '你没有。因为你没有。因为你配不上他...' 这声音在她脑海深处低语。

"And if you are having such a good time with Shinji, what brought you out here muttering to yourself to 'shut up shut up shut up!'?" Ching asked carefully.

"如果你和真嗣在一起这么开心，是什么让你独自来到这里，喃喃自语着'闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴！'呢？" 青小心翼翼地问道。

"It's... complicated," Asuka said.

"这事儿...挺复杂的，"明日香说道。

"Ah, one of those." “啊，又是那种。”

"This isn't easy!" Asuka exclaimed in frustration.

"这可不容易！"明日香沮丧地喊道。

"I'm not mocking you, Asuka. I can't even say anything simple and annoying like 'just say it!', because I understand exactly what you mean. Like I said yesterday, they can be scary and powerful words." Ching paused. "Do you want to talk about any of it? If you were having such a good time His Majesty warned me off from even knocking, it must have been something pretty unpleasant to get you walking out here in a hurry talking like that."

我不是在嘲笑你，明日香。我甚至说不出像“直说吧！”这样简单又烦人的话，因为我完全明白你的意思。就像我昨天说的，那些话可能既可怕又强大。”青停顿了一下。“你想谈谈吗？如果你玩得那么开心，陛下甚至警告我不要敲门，那一定是非常不愉快的事情，让你急匆匆地走到这里，用那种语气说话。”

Asuka gave a bitter snort. "'Talk about it'? That's what he always says."

明日香苦涩地哼了一声。“‘谈一谈’？他总是这么说。”

"But you don't, do you? You can't talk about a lot of it with him because it's about him? Or things you don't want him to know?"

但你不会，对吧？你无法和他谈论很多事情，因为那些事与他有关？或是你不想让他知道的事情？

Asuka gave her a wary look. "You sure you're not reading my mind?"

明日香警惕地看了她一眼，“你确定你不是在读我的心思？”

Ching stuck her tongue out at her. "They didn't give you a degree in Mathematics just because you were cute, and they didn't give me a PhD in psych just because I've got nice legs. I've got years of training in this, remember? I joined the Navy after I had a few decades of practice under my belt. I'm intuitive and good at reading people, even absent any psionic assists."

青对她吐了吐舌头。“他们不会因为你可爱就给你数学学位，也不会因为我腿好看就给我心理学博士学位。我在这方面可是有多年训练的，记得吗？我在积累了几十年的经验后加入了海军。我直觉敏锐，擅长洞察人心，即使没有心灵感应的帮助。”

"Thanks for the reminder that you people are really strange. Yes, it's stuff I don't want to talk about, especially with the Third. Yes, some of it's about him. It's... complicated because some of it is that the only person who could understand a lot of it is him, but he's also the person I least want to know some of it."

多谢提醒，你们这些人确实挺奇怪的。没错，有些事我不想谈，尤其是跟老三。是的，其中有些事与他有关。这很复杂，因为能理解其中大部分的人只有他，但他也是我最不想让他知道某些事的人。

"Do you trust him?" "你信任他吗？"

Asuka looked at her hands. "...I'm not even sure I trust myself at the moment, let alone anyone else."

明日香看着自己的双手。“……我现在甚至都不确定是否信任自己，更别提别人了。”

"That will make talking about it or telling him anything rather... complicated, yeah," Ching said with a mordant smile. "If you're reluctant to say anything out loud, would you mind if I made some educated guesses?"

“那会让谈论这件事或告诉他任何事情变得相当……复杂，没错，”青带着一丝讥讽的微笑说道，“如果你不愿意大声说出来，介意我做一些有根据的猜测吗？”

"Can I stop you?" "我能打断一下吗？"

Ching held up one palm. "Sure, you can, but that just leaves you right where you are; arguing with yourself and running away from what you just told me was a pretty nice morning. I'm betting you'd much rather be able to go back inside and keep doing what you were doing for the last hour plus, but you won't be able to until and unless you put down whatever demon chased you out here."

青举起一只手掌。“当然，你可以这么做，但这只会让你停留在原地；与自己争论，逃避你刚才告诉我的那个相当美好的早晨。我敢打赌，你更愿意能够回到屋里，继续你过去一个多小时所做的事情，但除非你放下那个把你赶出来的恶魔，否则你无法做到。”

"Great. Fine. 'Lay on, Macduff.'" Asuka waved at her to proceed.

很好。行。“来吧，麦克白夫人的丈夫。”阿苏卡向她挥手示意继续。

"'And damned be him that first cries 'Hold, enough!''?" Ching finished the quote. "Let's hope it's not that bad." She leaned back and closed her eyes. "Hmm...since it's bad enough to make you leave at least an hour of making out with a boy who's been in to you for years and just told you this morning that he loves you, it's got to be pretty bad. And it has you talking to yourself, so it was something internal. You didn't sound too happy with yourself either..." She sat silently for a moment. Her eyes opened again. "You've got some part of you saying 'you're a nasty, evil person who doesn't deserve all this happiness'?"

"'And damned be him that first cries 'Hold, enough!''?" 青完成了这句引述。"希望情况不会那么糟。" 她向后一靠，闭上了眼睛。"嗯...既然糟糕到让你放弃至少一个小时的亲吻时光，和一个暗恋你多年、今早刚向你表白的男孩，那肯定相当严重。而且你还自言自语，说明是内心的困扰。听起来你对自己也不太满意..." 她沉默了一会儿，然后睁开眼睛。"是不是有某个声音在说'你是个卑鄙邪恶的人，不配拥有这一切幸福'？"

"I'm starting to get tired of every other person on this planet knowing all of my deepest secrets," Asuka growled sourly.

"我开始厌倦这个星球上的每个人都知道我所有的深藏秘密，"明日香酸溜溜地咆哮道。

Ching shrugged a little. "I will confess this is easier than it would be coming in blind since I got to see the file with all your records. And we did talk about this yesterday. I take it from your terribly cheerful reaction that I'm pretty on-target?"

青耸了耸肩。“我得承认，比起一无所知地进来，现在要容易些，因为我看过你所有的档案资料。而且我们昨天也讨论过这事。从你那异常欢快的反应来看，我猜我应该是相当准确吧？”

"Yeah. It was a pretty nice morning. The last couple of hours... Do you know how long it's been since I kissed someone because I just wanted to? I was feeling good, really good for the first time in longer than I can remember... then suddenly I'm fighting off... everything I hate about myself. I deserve this, damn it! I've fought long enough! I've been unhappy most of my life! Why shouldn't I be happy now?" Asuka rose and started pacing back and forth.

是啊，那是个相当美好的早晨。过去的几个小时里……你知道我有多久没因为纯粹想吻而吻过别人了吗？我那时感觉很好，真的很好，久到我都记不清上一次这么好是什么时候了……然后突然间，我就在与……所有我讨厌的自己作斗争。我活该这样，该死！我已经斗争得够久了！我大半辈子都不快乐！为什么我现在就不能快乐呢？”明日香站起身，开始来回踱步。

"I agree. You and Shinji have more than earned a lot of love and happiness. Your whole world was practically built to make you all miserable. You've seen the ship named after you. The Lady herself has held you and blessed you. You have no idea how many people here think of you as a hero and someone worthy of love. But that won't mean a lot unless you can convince yourself too." Ching put her chin on her fist and thought. "You may not trust yourself right now, but... he tells you he loves you, you sleep next to him, you've fought next to him, and you are ready to keep on doing both. Do you trust him?"

我同意。你和真嗣已经赢得了许多爱与幸福。你们的世界几乎就是为了使你们痛苦而构建的。你见过以你命名的那艘船。那位女士亲自拥抱过你，为你祝福。你不知道这里有多少人视你为英雄，认为你值得被爱。但这些都不足以说明什么，除非你也能说服自己。"青将下巴搁在拳头上，沉思着。"你现在可能不信任自己，但是……他告诉你他爱你，你与他同床共枕，你与他并肩作战，而且你准备继续这样做。你信任他吗？"

Asuka stopped pacing and stared at the horizon. "As much as I trust anyone at all right now, yeah."

明日香停止了踱步，凝视着地平线。“尽管我现在对任何人都没有完全的信任，但，是的。”

"Then trust in him. He knows all these things about you, and loves you anyway. He thinks you're worthy. If you don't trust your own judgment right now, have faith in his."

那么就信任他吧。他了解你的一切，却依然爱你。他认为你值得。如果你现在对自己的判断没有信心，那就相信他的吧。

Asuka sighed. "I don't know if that will work. Shinji...he can be a spineless jellyfish a lot of the time. When he decides something is important he can be incredibly stubborn to the point of death on it, but I don't know if I can rely on this being one of them."

明日香叹了口气。“我不知道这招是否管用。真嗣他……很多时候就像个没骨头的海蜇。一旦他认定某件事重要，就会固执到哪怕为之送命也在所不惜，但我不知道这次他是否也会如此。”

"He said those incredibly scary and powerful words right to you this morning. After all the things I know you two have been through, I'd say that's a pretty good sign he's decided you are important to him."

他今早当面对你说了那些极其可怕且有力的话。考虑到我所知的你们俩经历的一切，我认为这相当明显地表明他已经决定你对他很重要。

"Maybe." Asuka sounded less than confident. "He's sure given me a lot of power over him. Swearing to never desert me, owing me a life, telling me that I make him feel alive, that he doesn't want to be apart from me...'

"或许吧。"明日香的声音听起来并不自信。"他确实给了我很多控制他的权力。发誓永不抛弃我，欠我一条命，告诉我我让他感觉活着，说他不想与我分离……"

"Mmm..." Ching grunted. "嗯..." 青哼了一声。

Asuka looked at her. "What? That was not a good noise. What else is wrong now?"

明日香看着她。“什么？那不是个好声音。现在又出什么问题了？”

"Have faith in at least this; Shinji does love you. Of that I have no doubt. But...I think that besides that love, another reason he's so ready to give so much power over him away to you is...well, while Shinji doesn't actively hate himself the way you are struggling with, he does have an abysmally low sense of self-worth. He thinks he's nothing. I think that's something that was keeping him from ever telling you before; he'd never felt worthy of you. Now that he's confessed, he still may have little regard for himself, so he'll rely on you."

至少请相信这一点：真嗣确实爱你。对此我毫不怀疑。但是……我认为，除了那份爱之外，他之所以如此轻易地将如此大的权力交给你，还有一个原因……嗯，尽管真嗣并不像你那样挣扎着憎恨自己，但他确实有着极低的自我价值感。他认为自己一无是处。我想这可能是他之前从未向你坦白的原因；他从未觉得自己配得上你。如今他已表白，尽管他可能仍不看重自己，但他会依赖你。

"Well that's just great! If we're both so reliant on the other to hold it together, how are we still going to be able to stand up straight at all?" Asuka complained.

“这可真是太好了！如果我们俩都这么依赖对方来维持现状，那我们到底还怎么站得直啊？”明日香抱怨道。

"Do what you said yesterday: Push back."

践行昨日之言：坚决回击。

"What?" "什么？"

"A binary relationship is all about the bonds between you, about being there for each other, and covering, reinforcing, and supporting each other's weaknesses and soft spots. Pushing back isn't about pushing the other away, it's about not being afraid to push in to them, about letting them into your defenses and letting them help build you up from within. That's why trust is such a big piece of any relationship. You're letting them inside, and they're letting you inside them. You cover each other, build each other up, make each other stronger, all based on the fact that when you do so, you know, you know at a deep, deep level, that that one, your one will always be there for you, always support and protect you above all else and all others. So push back, not just the things you want from him, but the good things too. Building him up builds you up too. Love depends on what you give, not what you take."

二元关系的核心在于彼此间的纽带，在于相互扶持，弥补、加固和支持对方的弱点与软肋。所谓的推拒并非将对方推离，而是不畏惧深入彼此，敞开防御，让他们从内部助你成长。这便是信任在任何关系中占据重要地位的原因。你允许对方进入内心，对方亦然。你们相互守护，共同成长，使彼此更为坚强，这一切都基于一个深信不疑的事实：无论何时，你的那位，总会无条件地支持你、保护你，超越一切。因此，不仅要向他索取所需，也要回馈美好。助他成长，亦是自我提升。爱情的本质在于付出，而非索取。

"'You get what you give, so give it all.'?" Asuka echoed as she stared at the horizon.

"你付出什么，就得到什么，所以全力以赴吧。" 明日香重复着，凝视着地平线。

Ching cocked her head. "Exactly. Where did you hear that?"

青青歪着头问道：“没错。你是从哪儿听来的？”

"I think I may have been talking to myself. Or at least family."

我想我可能一直在自言自语。或者至少是在和家人说话。

Ching blinked for a second. "Um... oh, you talked to one of your analogues?"

青眨了眨眼，迟疑了一下。“呃……哦，你和你的一个相似体交谈了？”

"Yeah, or at least the daughter of one. She sent us a family photo with a note attached that had that in it," Asuka said thoughtfully. "And it also mentioned the 'push back' thing a few hours before I actually said it, but I didn't see the note until this morning. I wonder if I'm telling myself something that another 'me' found good advice."

"是啊，或者至少是其中一位的女儿。她给我们寄了一张全家福，附带的便条上提到了这个，" 明日香若有所思地说。"而且便条还提到了'推回去'的事，比我实际说出口早了几个小时，但我直到今早才看到那便条。我在想，我是不是在给自己传达另一个'我'认为的好建议。"

"Sounds good to me. I really do envy you, Asuka, to be so young and have someone who feels like that for you, especially after all you've been through. You should grab on to all the happiness you can with both hands and hang in there tight. And I'm proud to get the chance to fight alongside you both in this campaign." Ching stood up. "You feel ready to go back inside now? I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the boy who told you this morning that he loves you probably liked spending the last couple hours making out with you, and would like to do it some more before we take off for your world." Ching's smile shifted into a sly grin. "So tell me, is he a good kisser?"

听起来不错。我真的很羡慕你，明日香，如此年轻就有人对你有那样的感觉，尤其是在你经历了那么多之后。你应该用双手紧紧抓住你能得到的每一份幸福。我很荣幸有机会与你们俩一起参与这次行动。"青站了起来。"现在准备好进去了吗？我大胆猜测，今早告诉你他爱你的那个男孩，可能喜欢过去几个小时与你亲吻，而且在我们启程前往你的世界之前，他还想再亲吻你一会儿。"青的笑容变成了狡黠的笑。"告诉我，他吻技如何？"

Asuka felt her cheeks heating up again. "Um...no comment?"

明日香感到自己的脸颊又热了起来。“呃……无可奉告？”

"Two straight hours, hmm?"

"整整两个小时，嗯？"

"Don't we have important strategic meetings to get to?" Asuka started walking quickly back towards the door inside.

"我们不是还有重要的战略会议要参加吗？" 明日香加快脚步，朝门内的方向走去。

"Can I kiss him myself and find out?"

我能亲自吻他并找出答案吗？

"No!" "不！"

"How about just a quick feel to check his buns for firmness?"

来个快速感受，检查下他的面包是否够结实？

"NO!" "不！"

"You're no fun." 你真没趣。

### Chapter 18 Family Arguments

Shinji Ikari was having a good day, despite the occasional terror. Considering how most of the last six years of his life had gone, the fact that the terror was toned down to just 'occasional', involved no immediately direct threats to his life, and had some really nice parts in between, today was making a bid to be named 'the best day ever' in his life.

碇真嗣今天过得不错，尽管偶尔还是会感到恐惧。考虑到过去六年生活的常态，如今恐惧感只是偶尔出现，且并未直接威胁到他的生命，期间还穿插着一些美好的时刻，今天简直可以竞选他人生中“最美好的一天”。

He'd told her. She'd asked him and he'd told her. And she'd been happy about it. They walked around in the sun and surf for over an hour just holding hands. He'd confirmed what he'd said in front of some of his old friends, back from nothing. And then they'd come back to their beach house and... and... wow.

他告诉了她。她问了他，而他告诉了她。她为此感到高兴。他们在阳光和海浪中手牵手漫步了一个多小时。他当着一些旧友的面确认了他所说的话，这些朋友曾一无所有。然后他们回到了他们的海滨别墅，然后……然后……哇。

He now had some idea of why kids in his class had been so fond of going out on dates all the time, and knew why that couple he'd seen in the movie theater during one of his 'running away' periods had shown no interest in the movie. He'd found a much, much more interesting way to kill two hours.

他现在有些明白为什么班上的孩子们总是热衷于外出约会，也理解了那次在电影院“逃离”期间看到的那对情侣为何对电影毫无兴趣。他找到了一种远比电影有趣得多的方式来消磨两个小时。

He'd been somewhat saddened to see Ching follow Asuka back in from her walk. He'd had happy hopes of resuming where they'd left off after they'd had something to eat. But he'd been happily surprised when a determined-looking Asuka had simply marched into the kitchen, grabbed him by the shirtfront, and pulled him into a thorough kiss in front of Ching. She stuck her tongue out at Ching right afterward, which had only made Ching giggle. Shinji was puzzled, but decided he didn't feel like worrying about it right then. He didn't feel like worrying about anything.

看到 Ching 跟随 Asuka 从散步中回来，他有些失落。原本满心期待在用餐后能继续之前未完的温存。然而，当 Asuka 一脸坚决地走进厨房，一把抓住他的衬衫前襟，在 Ching 面前给了他一个深吻时，他惊喜不已。随后 Asuka 还对 Ching 吐了吐舌头，这举动只让 Ching 咯咯笑了起来。尽管 Shinji 感到困惑，但他决定此刻不想为此烦恼。他什么都不想担忧。

But he knew he should be worrying about something. He tried to suppress the smile that kept breaking out on his face and focus his mind on the upcoming meeting with Rei. Rei... he'd always felt that sense of connection with her, that odd longing. He'd thought it was the closest he'd know to romantic love back then. Now, it was reforming as another piece building into the... the family? He had his mother back. His father too, albeit a bit provisionally. He had his friends, foster mother, and the man who'd been more of a father to him than his own flesh and blood back then. He even had, though he'd only barely dared think it today, a girlfriend. And now they were about to go meet his sister.

但他知道自己应该担心些什么。他努力抑制着不断在脸上绽放的笑容，集中精神思考即将与零见面的情景。零……他一直与她有着那种奇妙的联系和莫名的渴望。他曾以为那是他对浪漫爱情的最近理解。如今，这份情感正转变为构建……家庭的一部分？他的母亲回来了，父亲也是，尽管有些暂时性。他有朋友，有养母，还有那个在那时比亲生父亲更像父亲的人。他甚至，尽管今天才敢稍稍这么想，有了女朋友。而现在，他们即将去见他的妹妹。

Daniel, Rayana, and his mother had arrived while they'd still been eating their pre-noon meal with Ching, and said they'd be going to their Earth as soon as they were done. Their lunchtime planning session was being punted to later, to give Touji and Horaki-san time to think.

丹尼尔、雷亚娜和他母亲在他们与晶共进午前餐时抵达，并表示一吃完就会前往他们的地球。原定的午餐计划会议被推迟，以便给东治和崛山先生时间思考。

Shinji tugged at his fresh white shirt. Asuka had donned her close imitation of her old yellow sun dress. They stood on the beach just outside their house, hands joined, waiting for Daniel and Rayana to finish some quiet conversation they'd suddenly begun as they all walked outdoors. Their discussion, whatever it was, quickly concluded with an embrace and a farewell kiss, and Rayana vanished.

真嗣拉了拉他崭新的白衬衫。明日香则穿上了她那件与旧日黄色太阳裙极为相似的仿制品。两人手牵手站在屋外的海滩上，等待着丹尼尔和瑞亚娜结束他们突然开始的私密对话。他们的谈话内容不得而知，但很快就以一个拥抱和告别之吻告终，随后瑞亚娜便消失了。

"Rayana won't be coming with us on this trip. One chapter of her followers has sent out a call for emergency help in a far foreign worldline, so she's gone to aid them," Daniel explained as he joined them. "You all as ready as you're going to be?"

雷亚娜这次不会和我们同行。她的一位追随者在遥远的异世界线发出了紧急求助，因此她已前去支援，"丹尼尔边解释边加入他们，"你们都准备好了吗？

Yui nodded. "Let's go find my daughter."

结城点了点头。“我们去找我女儿吧。”

The black portal flared open in front of them once again, and they stepped through. Shinji blinked as they exited the portal into a grassy field in starlit blackness, not the familiar interior of their shoreside tent. The terrain that he could make out in the dimness held little resemblance to the area near old Marseille that Jinnai's UN fleet had been assembling off of.

黑色传送门再次在他们面前猛然开启，他们迈步穿了过去。走出传送门，真嗣眨了眨眼，发现自己置身于一片星光下的草地上，而非熟悉的岸边帐篷内。昏暗中能辨认出的地形与金井的联合国舰队在老马赛附近集结的区域大相径庭。

"Where are we?" Asuka asked, having reached the same conclusion.

"我们在哪儿？"明日香问道，她也得出了同样的结论。

"Fifty kilometers north-northwest of what's left of Buenos Aires. The UN fleet is supposed to be heading there, so we're going to set up our intervention force's base camp here. I figured this was a little better than turning your tent into a transit terminal, and trying to contact Ayanami-san is as good from this location as any other," Daniel said.

在布宜诺斯艾利斯残存地带西北偏北五十公里处。联合国舰队预计将前往那里，因此我们打算在此设立干预部队的营地。我觉得这比把你的帐篷变成中转站要好一些，而且从这个位置联系绫波小姐和其他任何地方一样方便，”丹尼尔说道。

"How are we going to do that, exactly?" Yui asked. She looked up at the red Ring of Souls arcing across the sky. "Fly up and see her?"

"我们究竟要怎么做呢？" 结衣问道，抬头望向天空中横跨的红色灵魂之环，"飞上去见她吗？"

Daniel shook his head. "She contacted Shinji on the ground through his dreams. We won't need to go up to the physical location of the Ring to get in touch with her. I'll reach out to her from down here on a less physical plane, and bring you three along."

丹尼尔摇了摇头。“她通过梦境在地面上联系了真嗣。我们不需要亲自前往环的物理位置与她接触。我会在这里以一种不那么实体的方式联系她，并带上你们三个。”

"How? From what you've shown me, Rei is some kind of god now. How are we going to get a hold of her?" Yui asked.

"怎么找？从你展示给我的来看，零现在简直成了某种神明。我们怎么才能联系上她呢？" 结城问道。

"Fortunately, I'm an old hand at talking to such. Come up from time to time in my job. Everyone join hands, please. It will make it easier to keep you in the link."

幸好，我与这类人交谈已是老手，工作中不时会遇到。请大家手拉手，这样更容易让你们保持在联系中。

Shinji took his mother's hand, and Asuka took Daniel's. They stood watching Daniel, waiting for something to happen. Daniel closed his eyes, and the world... went misty. Eerie fog seemed to fill every space around them. Nothing else seemed to have... wait. Shinji narrowed his eyes and looked at their party more closely. Asuka was still in her yellow dress... but now it was the old dress, down to the bows on her shoulders and band of blue velvet at her throat. She was younger, back to fourteen again. He looked down at himself. Yeah, himself too. His mother had gained a white lab coat. Daniel... Shinji blinked. Daniel looked the same... but odd, like he was a 3D image receding into the distance, but at the same time right in front of them.

真嗣握住母亲的手，明日香则牵起丹尼尔的手。他们站立着，注视着丹尼尔，等待着某种变化的发生。丹尼尔闭上双眼，世界……变得朦胧起来。诡异的雾气似乎充斥着四周每一个角落。其他的一切似乎都……等等。真嗣眯起眼睛，更仔细地观察着他们的队伍。明日香依旧穿着那件黄色裙子……但现在，那是她旧时的裙子，连肩上的蝴蝶结和颈间的蓝色天鹅绒带都一模一样。她变年轻了，回到了十四岁。他低头看向自己。没错，他自己也是。他的母亲穿上了一件白色实验服。丹尼尔……真嗣眨了眨眼。丹尼尔看起来没变……但又有些奇怪，就像是一个逐渐远去的 3D 影像，同时又近在咫尺。

"Alright, you can break the circle here, it won't affect the one in our physical bodies. That will stay until we return. And we should see Ayanami-san... there." Daniel pointed into the mist behind Shinji.

好了，你可以在这里打破圆圈，这不会影响我们肉体中的那个。那个会一直保留到我们回来。我们应该能看到绫波小姐...在那里。"丹尼尔指向真嗣身后迷雾中的方向。

Shinji turned... and there she was. Exactly as she had been before in his dream-visions, student uniform and all. "Rei..." he said softly.

真嗣转过身...她就站在那里。和他在梦境中所见一模一样，连学生制服都分毫不差。“绫波...”他轻声唤道。

"Hello, Ikari. It is good to see you again. Dr. Ikari," she nodded politely to his mother. Whatever faint warmth there was in her voice when she spoke to him faded. Her tone chilled to utter flatness. "Pilot Sohryu."

"你好，碇。再次见到你真好。碇博士，"她礼貌地向他的母亲点头致意。她对他讲话时声音中那微弱的一丝温暖消失了，语气变得冰冷而平淡。"明日香驾驶员。"

"Hello to you too, Wondergirl," Asuka said slightly sarcastically. Shinji felt her grip on his hand tighten. "Been a while."

"你也好啊，神奇女孩，"明日香略带讽刺地说道。真嗣感觉到她握住他的手紧了紧。"好久不见。"

Rei's eyes took in their handclasp without visible expression for a moment, then returned to Shinji's face. "I have been... worried, Ikari. You have vanished from my awareness several times in the last few hours. And now you return with your mother somehow retrieved from her Evangelion." She looked behind him at Daniel. "Who are you? You are... I do not know you." For the first time Shinji could recall since the time he'd asked her to smile, Rei looked confused.

绫波的目光在他们紧握的手上一时未见波澜，随后又回到真嗣的脸上。“我一直……很担心，碇。你在过去的几个小时里多次从我的感知中消失。而现在，你带着你的母亲，不知怎么从她的 EVA 中回来了。”她越过他看向丹尼尔。“你是谁？我……不认识你。”这是真嗣自请求她微笑以来，首次记得绫波露出困惑的神情。

'He's... um, 'not from around here', Rei,' Shinji thought. 'You should know every soul on Earth, and you don't know him. No wonder you look confused.'

他...呃，“不是本地人”，丽，真嗣心想，“你应该认识地球上的每一个灵魂，却不认识他。难怪你看起来很困惑。”

"My name is Daniel, Ayanami-san. I'm... a friend of the family, as it were. I've been helping your fellow Pilots with some problems. My lady wife helped Shinji regain his mother from Eva Unit-01. And it is their joint concern for you that brings us here now."

我叫丹尼尔，绫波小姐。我算是……家族的朋友吧。我一直在帮助其他驾驶员解决一些问题。我的夫人帮助了真嗣从初号机中找回了他的母亲。正是他们对你共同的关心，让我们此刻来到这里。

Rei looked between Shinji and Yui. "Joint concern?" she asked without inflection.

绫波在真嗣和唯之间来回看了看，语气平淡地问道：“共同的担忧？”

"Rei... I...you... you're..." Shinji couldn't even think of how else to say it. "...my sister."

"绫波...我...你...你是..." 真嗣甚至想不出其他方式来表达。"...我的妹妹。"

Rei looked at him, still expressionless. "I do not understand."

绫看着他，依旧面无表情。“我不明白。”

Yui stepped up next to him. "Rei, I think you are my daughter. Gendo used my DNA as half of the basis for your body. You are Shinji's half-sister by blood. You are family."

绫波丽身边，她开口道：“丽，我想你是我的女儿。碇源堂用我的 DNA 作为你身体的一半基础。你和真嗣是血缘上的半兄妹。你是我们的家人。”

Rei just looked back at her. "That is... I do not understand why you think this knowledge will change anything for me. I no longer have nor require a body."

绫只是回头看着她。“那是……我不明白为什么你会认为这些知识会对我有任何改变。我既不再拥有，也不再需要一个身体。”

"I am adept and experienced at solving such dilemmas, Ayanami-san. I can provide a body as you need," Daniel said.

“我擅长且经验丰富，能解决这类难题，绫波小姐。我可以提供您所需的躯体，”丹尼尔说道。

"I am the guardian of the many souls in the Ring. I cannot leave that station. However much I may care to." Rei looked directly at Shinji.

我是众多灵魂在戒指中的守护者。我不能离开那个岗位，无论我多么想要离开。" 绫波丽直视着真嗣。

Daniel spread his hands. "It may take further exploration, Ayanami-san, but I believe I can assist you in shepherding the remaining souls in the Ring back into corporeal existence. The large number of people makes it impractical to do all at once, but once we stabilize and rebuild this world a bit, we can return humanity to its original state and free you from the requirement of maintaining your place as gatekeeper and framework of the Ring."

丹尼尔摊开双手：“可能需要进一步探索，绫波小姐，但我相信我能帮助你引导环中剩余的灵魂回归实体存在。人数众多，一次性完成不切实际，但一旦我们稳定并重建这个世界，我们就能让人类恢复原状，并解除你作为守门人和环框架的职责。”

"And then I might return to a body like I possessed before?" Rei continued to stare at Shinji, her gaze gaining maybe a flicker of interest. Asuka's eyes started to narrow.

"那我或许能回到之前那样的身体？" 绫波继续凝视着真嗣，她的目光中似乎闪过一丝兴趣。明日香的眼睛开始眯了起来。

"I believe we can accomplish that, or at least a body very close to what you once had. We might have to see about how your return to flesh and blood might risk the chance of a disaster like the Third Impact again, but I'm sure it will not prove insuperable. Another issue we wanted to ask you about though; is the same possible for Shinji's brief fiend Nagisa-san? Does he still exist as a separable entity within you?"

我相信我们能够实现这一点，或者至少创造出一个与你曾经拥有的身体极为接近的躯体。我们可能需要探讨一下，你恢复血肉之躯是否会再次引发类似第三次冲击那样的灾难风险，但我确信这并非不可逾越的难题。此外，我们还想询问你另一个问题：对于真嗣短暂的朋友渚薰先生，是否也有可能实现同样的分离？他是否仍作为可分离的实体存在于你之中？

Rei's unblinking look finally left Shinji and shifted to Daniel. She said nothing for a moment, then her eyes shifted right back. Nagisa Kaworu stepped out of the mists behind her to stand next to Rei, the same easy smile on his face that he had so often worn for the few days Shinji had known him. "I am here. We are both here. The process of Instrumentality has bound us together, but possibly not inextricably. Hello, Shinji. I told you death and life were the same to me. Perhaps you will trust what I say a bit more next time?" He smiled.

绫波的目光终于从真嗣身上移开，转向了丹尼尔。她沉默了一会儿，随后眼神又转了回来。渚薰从她身后的迷雾中走出，站在绫波旁边，脸上依旧是那副真嗣所熟悉的、这几日来常见的轻松微笑。“我在这里。我们都在这里。人类补完计划将我们联系在一起，但或许并非不可分割。你好，真嗣。我曾告诉你，对我而言，生与死并无区别。或许下次，你会更相信我的话？”他微笑着。

Shinji's gaze had finally escaped Rei's eerie stare to lock on Kaworu's face. His stomach churned. He felt thrilled to again see the one person in his life who had offered him affection while asking nothing in return, and been his only friend when his whole world had been going to pieces. He felt like falling down and begging forgiveness of another good person his actions had hurt or killed. And he felt again the boiling despair and hatred that had filled him to learn his friend was a liar, a traitor, and his enemy. "Trust? I did trust you. Then you tried to end the world and kill everyone I know. Then I had to destroy my own heart and kill you."

真嗣的目光终于从绫波诡异的凝视中挣脱，锁定在薰的脸上。他的胃里翻江倒海。再次见到生命中唯一一个不求回报给予他关爱，并在他整个世界支离破碎时成为他唯一朋友的人，他感到无比激动；他觉得自己仿佛要跪倒在地，向另一个因他而受伤或丧生的善良之人乞求宽恕。同时，他又再次感受到得知朋友是骗子、叛徒和敌人时那种沸腾的绝望与憎恨。“信任？我确实信任过你。然后你试图毁灭世界，杀害我所认识的每一个人。接着，我不得不摧毁自己的心，亲手杀了你。”

Kaworu's smile never faltered. "I am sorry that it had to come to that, Shinji. We cannot escape who we are. I could not forever resist the Call in my blood to unite with Father. I did find joy in my time with you. Joy enough that in the end I could not accept that completing my mission would cost you your existence. I do not regret having met you, even after that. I was and am happy that I could at least make the choice to let you go on living. And now we are together again." He nodded at Daniel. "I appreciate your kind offer, but I do not think our two souls can coexist on the same world at the same time. Our nature will drive us to either expel or overcome the other as long as we are on the same world."

薰的微笑始终未曾动摇。“真嗣，我很抱歉事情发展到了这一步。我们无法逃避自己的本质。我无法永远抗拒血液中与父亲合一的呼唤。与你共度的时光里，我确实找到了快乐。这份快乐足以让我在最后关头，无法接受完成使命将牺牲你的存在。即使在那之后，我也没有后悔遇见你。我感到幸福，至少我能做出选择，让你继续活下去。而现在，我们又重逢了。”他向丹尼尔点头致意。“感谢你的好意，但我认为我们两个灵魂无法在同一个世界中共存。只要身处同一世界，我们的本性将驱使我们排斥或征服对方。”

"Let me do some exploring of options, Nagisa-san. What you say may be true now, but I might be able to learn how that imperative was built into your nature from your progenitors and possibly how to remove that compulsion from you," Daniel said with a matching smile.

“让我探索一下各种可能性，渚小姐。你所说的现在可能是真的，但我或许能从你的先祖那里了解到这种命令是如何植入你本性的，甚至有可能帮你解除这种强迫，”丹尼尔带着同样的微笑说道。

Kaworu shook his head. "Our progenitors sent us from their world over four billion years ago. They are likely long vanished."

渚薰摇了摇头。“我们的祖先在四十亿年前从他们的世界派遣我们来到这里。他们可能早已消逝。”

"I didn't say it would be easy, just that I could do it. Life and death are the same to you? Time is just another axis of travel to me. Four billion years ago isn't the impossibly distant past, it's just a long distance to go."

我没说这事容易，只是说我能做到。生死对你而言无异吗？时间于我不过是另一条旅行轴线。四亿年前并非遥不可及的过去，它只是路途漫长罢了。

Kaworu and Rei looked surprised. They both looked at Shinji again. "My, my, Shinji, where did you find this person? It would be nice to be able to listen to music again. Experiencing it through the mass of all humanity's memories is not the same as listening with my own ears. And it would be nice to see you find love." He looked at Shinji and Asuka's still linked hands. "It is already beautiful to see its beginning."

薰和绫波显得很惊讶，两人再次看向真嗣。“哎呀，真嗣，你从哪儿找到这个人的？能再次聆听音乐该多好。通过全人类记忆的集体体验，终究不同于用自己的耳朵聆听。而且，看到你找到爱情也令人欣慰。”他望向真嗣和明日香依旧紧握的手。“这爱情的萌芽，已然美不胜收。”

"I also would like to be with you again." Rei said calmly. "I was ready to wait as long as it took to see you again, Ikari. I would like it if that was soon." Her eyes were still locked on Shinji.

"我也希望能再次与你相聚。" 绫波平静地说道，"我已做好准备，无论等多久都要再次见到你，碇。如果这能很快实现，我会很高兴。" 她的目光依旧紧锁在真嗣身上。

It was starting to really annoy Asuka. "Stop looking at him like that, Wondergirl," she growled.

这让明日香越来越恼火。“别那么看着他，奇迹少女，”她低吼道。

For the first time Rei looked at her. "Why?" Her question was perfectly cool. And ice cold.

这是雷伊第一次看向她。“为什么？”她的提问冷静得恰到好处，却又冰冷彻骨。

Asuka bristled. "He's not yours," she said, heat growing in her voice.

明日香怒气冲冲地说：“他不是你的。”她的声音中带着逐渐升腾的怒火。

"Neither is he yours. You have never treated him with care. I can see the light of your souls. Ikari is opening, and he points toward you. It is beautiful to see. But you are still closed. You do not care for him like I will."

他也不属于你。你从未对他悉心照料。我能看见你们灵魂的光芒。伊卡里正在开启，它指向你，这景象美极了。然而你仍旧封闭，你对他的关怀不及我。

"You 'will', huh? I don't think so. He told me he loves me. Me!" She looked at Shinji for a moment and he reveled in the warmth of the smile she gave him. Her eyes shone...

"你会'愿意'吗？我不这么认为。他告诉我他爱我。我！" 她看了真嗣一会儿，他沉浸在她给予的温暖微笑中。她的眼睛闪闪发亮...

Yui's eyebrows rose as she heard this piece of news. "Shinji?" she began to ask.

听到这个消息，绫波的眉毛微微上扬。“真嗣？”她开始问道。

Rei didn't look like she was getting angry... much. The faintest furrow appeared between her eyebrows. Her voice hardened just the slightest bit, and somehow got still colder. "You have always been cruel to him. You hurt him with your hands and with your words every day in class. You have always abused him for your own needs and fears. He begged you for the slightest bit of help or care during Instrumentality and you rejected him out of your own pride and fear of pain. Your heartless rejection almost dissolved humanity's individuality forever. His courage restored it. You have never been kind to him, ever. A month ago Ikari told me you hated him. And even now your soul is still closed to him. I can see it clearly. You do not deserve him."

丽看起来并没有太生气……只是眉间微蹙。她的声音略显生硬，却莫名更加冷冽。“你一直对他残忍。在课堂上，你每天用手和言语伤害他。你总是为了自己的需求和恐惧而虐待他。在人类补完计划期间，他恳求你给予哪怕一丝帮助或关怀，你却因自己的骄傲和害怕痛苦而拒绝了他。你那无情的拒绝几乎让人的个性永远消解。是他的勇气将其恢复。你从未对他仁慈过，从未。一个月前，碇告诉我你恨他。即便到现在，你的灵魂依旧对他封闭。我看得一清二楚。你不配拥有他。”

Shinji felt Asuka jerk like she'd been struck at the end of Rei's indictment. "How dare you say something like that? You know nothing about what I feel!" Asuka yelled back at her.

真嗣感觉到绫波的话语刚落，明日香就像是被击中一般猛地一震。“你怎么敢这么说？你根本不懂我的感受！”明日香冲着她吼回去。

"I can see your soul, and I have seen all of your mind. You cannot lie to me. You do not love him." Shinji had never seen anyone convey so much venom and dislike without so much as a raised voice or sharp tone. Rei's cool, almost detached way of speaking was stabbing Asuka deeper than any knife ever could.

我能看见你的灵魂，我已洞悉你全部的心思。你无法对我撒谎。你并不爱他。" 真嗣从未见过有人能如此充满恶意与厌恶，却连声音都未曾提高，语气也未见尖锐。绫波那冷静得近乎疏离的说话方式，比任何利刃更能刺痛明日香。

"You shut the fuck up, Wondergirl! He loves me! He's mine! You hear me? You are not going to take him from me!" Asuka hissed, more viciously than he'd ever heard from her before. Her free hand was starting to curl into claws and he felt her trembling on the edge of swinging at Rei.

"你他妈的闭嘴，奇迹女孩！他爱的是我！他是我的！你听见了吗？你休想把他从我身边夺走！" 明日香咬牙切齿地说道，语气比以往任何时候都要恶毒。她空着的那只手开始紧握成爪，他感觉到她正颤抖着，几乎要向绫波挥拳过去。

Rei betrayed no sign of fear of any strike. "He is not yours. I will not let you hurt him. That is all you have ever done to him."

零没有流露出对任何攻击的恐惧。“他不是你的。我不会让你伤害他。你对他所做的，从来只有伤害。”

Shinji raised his free hand and tried to stop the two girls. "Rei, please stop! She asked me. I told her that I love her. I meant it." Rei flicked her eyes to him for a second, but returned to staring at Asuka, who squeezed Shinji's hand in gratitude.

真嗣举起空着的手试图阻止两位女孩。“绫波，请停下！是她问我的。我告诉她我爱她。我是认真的。”绫波瞥了他一眼，但随即又转回盯着明日香，后者感激地紧握了真嗣的手。

"Do pardon the interruption, ladies," Daniel slid between them. "But this is not a productive line of discussion right now. Please calm yourselves." He faced Rei. "Ayanami-san, you can rest your fears, please. Shinji is in good hands that care about him. While he is in my world, nothing will harm him. We will return tomorrow morning to begin the stabilization and rebuilding of this Earth. I will investigate what we would need to do to allow the Ring of Souls to be emptied and you and Nagisa-san given the chance to enjoy life in human bodies again, for as long as you care to. Shinji and Asuka are together right now and both of them are satisfied with how their arrangement is progressing lately. Please give them the chance to explore that themselves."

"女士们，请原谅我的打断，"丹尼尔插话道，"但此刻这不是一个有成效的讨论方向。请你们冷静下来。"他转向绫波。"绫波小姐，请放下你的担忧。真嗣现在得到了关心他的人的照顾。在我的世界里，他不会受到任何伤害。我们将在明早回来，开始稳定和重建这个地球。我会调查我们需要做什么，才能让灵魂之环清空，让你和渚君有机会再次以人类之躯享受生活，只要你愿意。真嗣和明日香现在在一起，他们俩对近来的安排进展感到满意。请给他们机会自己去探索。"

Rei stared her thousand-meter stare at him. "I do not approve of how Pilot Sohryu treats him. She will only harm him. That is all she has ever done to him. And you take him away from where I can see them. Who are you?"

瑞以她那千米的凝视盯着他。“我不赞成飞行员惣流对待他的方式。她只会伤害他。她对他所做的仅此而已。而你却把他带离了我的视线。你是谁？”

"A friend, if you will let me be. We will return tomorrow."

朋友，若你允许我如此称呼。我们明日再来。

Rei's not-a-glare returned to Asuka. "I do not like how you treat him, Pilot Sohryu. And I will not accept you holding him for yourself, but remaining closed to him. Nor will I tolerate you or this person taking him away."

绫波的非怒视再次投向明日香。“我不喜欢你对待他的方式，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我不会接受你将他据为己有，却又对他封闭心扉。我也不会容忍你或这个人将他带走。”

"I don't care what you think," Asuka snarled back at her. "I'm happier now than I've been since you and fucking Commander Ikari blew up the world. I've gone through more shit in the last four years than any person should have to face in their whole lives, while you played Gott-in-Heaven here. You don't get to decide my life."

"我不在乎你怎么想，"明日香对她反唇相讥，"自从你和该死的碇司令毁灭世界以来，我现在比任何时候都要快乐。过去四年里我经历的破事比任何人一辈子都多，而你却在这里扮演着上帝。你没资格决定我的人生。"

"I will do whatever I can to keep him near and to protect him, Pilot Sohryu, even from your selfishness," Rei said coolly. "Until you convince me that you will no longer hurt him."

“我会尽我所能让他留在身边并保护他，碇真嗣飞行员，即使这意味着要对抗你的自私，”绫波丽冷静地说道，“直到你让我相信你不会再伤害他。”

Asuka got redder. She opened her mouth to launch into a new attack on Rei, but this time Yui interceded. "Both of you, stop it! Rei, I am Shinji's mother, just like I am yours. You can trust that I will look after him and not let anyone harm him. Sohryu-san, you and I will talk about this later. But right now both of you need to stop fighting!"

明日香的脸更红了。她张开嘴准备对绫波丽发起新一轮攻击，但这次，唯介入了。“你们俩，都别吵了！绫波，我是真嗣的母亲，也如同是你的母亲。你可以相信我会照顾好他，不让任何人伤害他。惣流小姐，我们稍后再谈这件事。但现在，你们俩必须停止争吵！”

"Indeed, this isn't getting us anywhere," Daniel added. "I think we'll break this up for now and pick up again tomorrow. We will come back in the morning. Hopefully you both will be a little cooler then." He eyed Asuka and Rei.

"确实，这样下去毫无进展，"丹尼尔补充道，"我想我们暂时先到这里，明天再继续。明早我们会回来。希望到时你们俩能冷静一些。"他目光扫过明日香和绫波。

"I do not want you to take him where I cannot see him," Rei said.

"我不想让你带他去我看不见的地方，" 蕾说。

"It is just for the night, Ayanami-san. No harm will come to them on my world. And we will return with my soldiers tomorrow to begin rebuilding this world. I aim to help everyone here, you and Nagisa-san included. This world has seen a lot of death and misfortune. I hope to undo much of it."

只是借住一晚，绫波小姐。在我的世界里，他们不会受到任何伤害。明天我会带着我的士兵回来，开始重建这个世界。我的目标是帮助这里的每一个人，包括你和渚先生。这个世界经历了太多的死亡和不幸，我希望能够挽回许多。

"It is difficult to trust someone I do not know who takes Ikari away where I cannot see him. I can see you, and your soul is not normal. Much of your light is hidden. Why? Why are you here?" Rei said.

“我不认识的人把碇带走，让我看不见他，这很难让人信任。我能看见你，你的灵魂并不寻常。你大部分的光芒都被隐藏了。为什么？你为什么在这里？”绫波说道。

"I do this because I care about you all and I can. I hide much of myself because most of your friends are not ready to see all of me. My soul is not normal because I am very old, and it has a lot of scars," Daniel said placatingly. "Shinji and Asuka have trusted me so far. I hope their trust in me will be enough of a validation of my intentions for you."

我这么做是因为我在乎你们大家，而且我能够做到。我隐藏了许多自己的部分，因为你们大多数朋友还没有准备好看到全部的我。我的灵魂不寻常，因为我非常古老，它布满了伤痕，”丹尼尔安抚地说道。“真嗣和明日香至今都信任我。我希望他们对我的信任足以证明我的意图。”

Rei stared at him silently for a long time. "I promise nothing. For now, I will watch. If I am family, I will have even more reason to care for Ikari's well being."

绫波丽长久地沉默地凝视着他。“我什么也不承诺。目前，我会观察。如果我是家人，我将更有理由关心碇的安危。”

Daniel sighed. "I hope you will accept what we're saying when you see us return in the morning, Ayanami-san. Until then, goodnight. To you too, Nagisa-san. Try to convince Ayanami-san of the value of trust, if you can," he said with a sad smile.

丹尼尔叹了口气。“我希望当你看到我们早上回来时，能接受我们所说的话，绫波小姐。在那之前，晚安。还有你，渚君，如果可以的话，试着让绫波小姐明白信任的价值。”他带着一丝忧伤的微笑说道。

Kaworu nodded, still smiling. Rei gave one last flat stare at Asuka as they and the mists faded away.

渚薰点头微笑，而绫波则向明日香投去最后一瞥，随后她们连同雾气一同消散。

They were once again holding hands in a circle in the darkness. Daniel let go and rubbed his forehead. "Well, that could have gone better."

他们又一次在黑暗中手拉手围成一圈。丹尼尔松开手，揉了揉额头。“嗯，那本可以更顺利些。”

Part 32 第三十二章

Making Up For Uncertainty

弥补不确定性

They stepped out of the portal back to Avalon to encounter a somewhat surprised Lieutenant Leibshott. "You're back rather quickly, Your Majesty. That was less than an hour."

他们从传送门回到阿瓦隆，迎面遇到了略显惊讶的莱布施特中尉。“陛下，您回来得真快，这还不到一个小时。”

"Our discussion with Ayanami-san could have gone more smoothly, Lieutenant. There were some touchy issues that arose." He frowned. "And that portal was harder to open than it should have been. I think Ayanami-san was trying to stop us from leaving." He sighed. "Would you accompany Dr. Ikari back to her cabin, if you please? I think our two young friends need some time alone together." At Yui's protesting sound he turned to her and added, "Please, Dr. Ikari. There things they need to talk about that I doubt they'll feel comfortable saying in front of one of their mothers. I'll be along in a bit to talk with you too." Yui did not look happy, but nodded. Lieutenant Leibshott stepped next to her, and murmured into her interface band. Electric blue sparkles surrounded them and they vanished.

与绫波小姐的讨论本可以更顺利些，中尉。出现了一些敏感问题。"他皱起眉头，"而且那个传送门比预想的要难打开。我认为绫波小姐试图阻止我们离开。"他叹了口气，"如果您愿意，请陪碇博士回她的舱室好吗？我想我们这两位年轻朋友需要一些独处的时间。"听到碇博士的抗议声，他转向她补充道，"拜托了，碇博士。他们有些事情需要私下交谈，我怀疑他们不会愿意在母亲面前说出口。我稍后也会去找你谈谈。"碇博士虽然不悦，但还是点了点头。莱布施特中尉走到她身边，对着她的接口带低语。电光蓝的火花环绕着他们，随即两人消失不见。

Daniel turned back to the two Pilots. They were still holding hands, but Shinji had a troubled look on his face. Asuka's was drifting towards a similar expression as her anger faded now that the target was no longer around and consciousness of just what had been said was starting to seep in. Her head snapped around to shoot an almost frightened look at Shinji.

丹尼尔转回身面对两位驾驶员。他们依旧手牵手，但真嗣脸上带着困扰的神情。随着目标的消失，明日香的怒气逐渐消退，她开始意识到刚才所言的含义，表情也趋向于与真嗣相似的忧虑。她猛地转头，用几乎带着惊恐的眼神望向真嗣。

Before Asuka could say anything, Shinji raised his head and looked at her, his face nearly blank. "Is what Rei said true, Asuka?" he asked, his voice almost hollow.

在明日香开口之前，真嗣抬起头，目光空洞地望着她。“绫波说的话是真的吗，明日香？”他问道，声音空洞得几乎不带情感。

Asuka paled. "I... I..." She looked almost lost. "I don't know!"

明日香脸色苍白。“我……我……”她看起来几乎迷失了方向。“我不知道！”

"You don't know?" "你不知道吗？"

Her grip on his hand was shaking.

她握着他的手在颤抖。

Daniel broke in gently. "Shinji, if you'd been asked that question two months ago, would you have been able to answer it any more clearly?"

丹尼尔温和地插话道：“真嗣，如果两个月前有人问你这个问题，你能回答得更清楚吗？”

"I don't... maybe... but this isn't the same! Two months ago I hadn't just had her tell me what I told her this morning! And... and Rei said she was looking at the 'light of our souls'! That we couldn't hide or lie!" Shinji voice was wavering between pain, confusion, and anger.

"我不...或许...但这不一样！两个月前，她还没有像今早那样告诉我那些话！而且...而且绫波说她在凝视'我们灵魂的光芒'！说我们无法隐藏或撒谎！" 真嗣的声音在痛苦、困惑与愤怒之间摇摆不定。

"And in two months things have changed. Shinji, look at her. Does she look happy, or does she look hurt, lost, and upset?"

两个月间，一切已变。真嗣，看看她。她是显得快乐，还是显得受伤、迷失、心烦意乱？

"What does that have to do-"

"那有什么关系-"

"Don't you have standing orders for this sort of situation?" Daniel hinted.

"这种情况下，你们不是有常规指令吗？"丹尼尔暗示道。

Shinji froze and really looked at her. Asuka locked her eyes back on his with an almost pleading look.

真嗣愣住了，真正地注视着她。明日香也紧紧地回望着他，眼中几乎带着恳求的神情。

"And didn't you two say something about promises earlier?" he went on.

"你们俩之前不是提到过什么承诺吗？"他接着说。

Slowly, Shinji brought his other hand up and pulled Asuka into an embrace. His eyes closed as he felt her arms wrap around him and cling to him like a life preserver. She shivered against him and whispered, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't know, I'm sorry," desperately into his shoulder over and over. Even in his confusion and the terrifying spectre of his fragile feelings being betrayed once again, it still felt so good to hold her. 'I don't want to stop this. Am I betraying myself by doing this? She's holding on so tight, like she needs me. Isn't that what I've wanted?'

缓缓地，真嗣抬起另一只手，将明日香拥入怀中。他闭上眼睛，感受到她的双臂环绕着自己，紧紧抓住他，如同抓住救生圈一般。她在他怀里颤抖着，一遍又一遍地对着他的肩膀低声呢喃：“对不起，对不起，我不知道，对不起。”即便在困惑与恐惧中，担心自己脆弱的情感再次被背叛，拥抱她的感觉依然如此美好。“我不想停止这样。我这样做是在背叛自己吗？她抱得这么紧，仿佛需要我。这不正是我所渴望的吗？”

As if to echo his thoughts, Asuka's whispers had trickled to a stop before she said softly but clearly, "I don't know, Shinji. But I do know that right now, I need this. I need you and I don't want you to go. Please." Shinji squeezed her tighter almost without thinking. Her shaking slowly subsided.

仿佛在回应他的思绪，明日香的低语在清晰而轻柔地说出“我不知道，真嗣。但我知道现在我需要这个。我需要你，我不想你离开。求你了。”之前已经渐渐停息。真嗣几乎不假思索地更紧地拥抱着她。她的颤抖慢慢平息下来。

"Do you regret anything you said this morning, Shinji? Would you take any of it back?" Daniel said.

"你对你今天早上说的话感到后悔吗，真嗣？你会收回其中任何一句吗？" 丹尼尔说。

Shinji pulled his head back far enough to look Asuka in the face. "No," he said. "I don't, and no I wouldn't. I meant it."

真嗣将头后仰，直视明日香的脸庞。“不，”他说，“我不，也不会。我是认真的。”

"Thank you," Asuka said quietly.

"谢谢你，"明日香轻声说道。

"Good," Daniel said. "Let's get in out of the sun. This is the kind of talk I think you'll want to do sitting down comfortably." He held the door open for them to file inside. Neither one moved, or showed much indication of wanting to let go of the other. "...orrrr we could keep standing out here for a while."

"好，"丹尼尔说，"我们进屋避避太阳吧。这种谈话，我想你会希望舒舒服服地坐着进行。"他为他们推开门，示意他们进去。然而，两人都未挪动，也没有表现出想要放开彼此的迹象。"...或者，我们可以继续在这里站一会儿。"

Daniel eyed them half-grin for a moment, then said, "Hey, Shinji. I bet you've wanted to do this for a while; just pick her up and carry her in here. That way you don't have to let go of each other."

丹尼尔半笑着看了他们一会儿，然后说：“嘿，真嗣。我打赌你早就想这么做了；直接把她抱起来带进来。这样你们就不用放开彼此了。”

'Why not? Today's been weird enough.' Shinji dipped far enough to put one of his arms behind Asuka's knees and hefted her up with a grunt of effort. After a second, the weight of her in his arms seemed to get easier to lift. He carefully carried her into the beach house.

'为什么不呢？今天已经够奇怪的了。' 真嗣俯身将一只手臂伸到明日香的膝后，用力一提，伴随着一声努力的声音将她抱起。片刻后，她在他怀中的重量似乎变得更容易承受。他小心翼翼地抱着她走进了海滩小屋。

Shinji maneuvered himself into one corner of the couch so he could lower himself down in such a way that Asuka could stay in his lap with her arms still latched tightly around him and her back slightly braced against the armrest of the couch. Daniel took a seat facing them across the cocktail table. No one moved or spoke for a moment, Asuka not relaxing her clasp on him at all, just holding on and seeming to draw strength from the grip.

真嗣巧妙地将自己挪到沙发的一角，以便他能缓缓坐下，让明日香仍能坐在他腿上，双臂紧紧环抱住他，背部略微倚靠着沙发的扶手。丹尼尔则在对面的茶几旁坐下，与他们相对。一时间，无人动弹，也无人言语，明日香丝毫没有放松对真嗣的紧抱，仿佛从这紧握中汲取着力量。

"I'm sure I don't need to tell you that the most prominent facet of Asuka's personality is her fierce, indomitable will, do I, Shinji?" Daniel said. Shinji nodded. "You two are a lot alike in ways. You were both hurt badly and deeply when you were very young, practically abandoned by your fathers after the loss of your mothers. In some ways her case was worse; you just had to watch your mother vanish, while she had to endure months of the slow torture of watching her mother succumb to madness ending in suicide. You reacted by drawing away from the world to avoid further pain. Asuka responded by focusing her will on herself, telling herself what she would feel; 'I am not sad. I will not cry. I am not afraid. I do not need mommy or daddy. I will live alone. I will be the best, to make people look at me. I am not lonely. I will never cry.' She kept on doing this in the aftermath of the Third Impact, even as badly hurting as she was, as things got worse and you were afraid to reach out to her; 'I don't need him. I am not lonely. I am not in pain. I am not afraid. I am doing what I have to in order to survive. I don't care. I don't hurt.' This may not have been healthy, but it kept her going."

"我确信无需赘述，明日香性格中最显著的特质便是她那强烈而不屈的意志，对吧，真嗣？"丹尼尔说道。真嗣点头表示认同。"你们俩在某些方面颇为相似。你们都在幼年时遭受了深重的伤害，几乎被失去母亲后的父亲遗弃。从某种程度上说，她的遭遇更为严重；你只是目睹了母亲的消失，而她却不得不忍受数月之久，眼睁睁看着母亲陷入疯狂直至自杀。你的反应是远离世界以避免更多痛苦。明日香则将意志集中于自身，不断告诫自己：'我不悲伤，我不会哭泣，我不害怕，我不需要爸爸妈妈，我将独自生活，我要成为最出色的，让人们注视我，我不孤独，我永不流泪。'即使在第三次冲击后，她身受重创，情况愈发恶化，而你因恐惧不敢向她伸出援手时，她依然坚持：'我不需要他，我不孤独，我不痛苦，我不害怕，我只是在为生存而做必须之事，我不在乎，我不受伤。'"这或许并不健康，但足以支撑她前行。"

"But now I show up and turn every sure thing in her life upside-down in the space of a few days. Something about you that always infuriated her is the way you always were so passive about things, just letting the world happen to you. Right now that passivity is letting you accept the things that are happening more easily than she has. Asuka's very sense of self has always been an active construct of her will. But things are happening to her now, fast and strong, faster than she can easily adapt to. It is badly cracking the constructed mask she has made the shield for her heart for so long, and this is both frightening and confusing for her. The events of the last few days and especially your actions and words are a big part of that."

然而如今，我一出现便在短短数日内将她生活中的确定性彻底颠覆。你总有一种特质让她怒不可遏，那就是你对事物的被动态度，任由世界摆布。此刻，正是这种被动让你比她更容易接受正在发生的一切。明日香的自我的构建一直是她意志的积极产物。但如今，事情正迅速而强烈地发生在她身上，快到她难以轻易适应。这严重地破坏了她长期以来用作心灵护盾的精心构筑的假面，这对她来说既令人恐惧又感到困惑。过去几天的种种事件，尤其是你的言行，正是这一变故的重要部分。

Shinji's head rose from staring at Asuka's face for the first time since they'd sat down. "Me?"

自从坐下后，真嗣首次将目光从明日香脸上移开，抬头问道：“我？”

Daniel gave him a small nod. "Asuka has been alone for a long time, just like you. Three years of forced physical proximity to men like Winthrop and Jinnai only increased her emotional isolation. In the last couple of days you've promised her things...that she has very much wanted to hear for years…her whole life. But the very strength of that desire and the potential for pain also scares her. And while I am sure your statements of feeling are true, they are happening to her, not by her, yet still affecting her deeply. She cannot simply tell herself how she feels anymore. She is losing her tight hold on the anchors of her life, and you, who was a key part of the familiar and stable in her life right now, has also suddenly become one of the biggest and most potent changes. She is highly uncertain of herself, her feelings, and where she is at all. So what Ayanami-san said is true, at least to that extent. She is still very closed up, and not sure of anything, particularly of how she feels about you after this morning. After all, she's only had a handful of hours to even think about it. So remember to consider Ayanami-san's accusations in that light."

丹尼尔向他微微点头。"明日香和你一样，已经孤独很久了。与温斯洛普和金井这样人三年的被迫身体接触，反而加深了她的情感孤立。最近几天，你对她许下的承诺，是她多年来渴望听到的……甚至是一生的渴望。但这种渴望的强烈程度和可能带来的痛苦也让她害怕。尽管我相信你的情感表达是真挚的，但这些感受是发生在她身上，而非她主动，却依然深深影响着她。她再也无法简单地告诉自己她的感受了。她正逐渐失去对生活支柱的紧握，而你，作为她生活中熟悉而稳定的关键部分，也突然变成了最大的、最具影响力的变化之一。她对自己、自己的感受以及所处的位置感到极度不确定。所以，绫波丽女士所说的至少在这一点上是正确的。她仍然非常封闭，对一切都拿不准，尤其是今早之后对你的感觉。毕竟，她只有几个小时来思考这一切。所以，请记住从这个角度考虑绫波丽女士的指责。"

"And as for how serious he is, Asuka, I'd like you to keep in mind something my wife told him yesterday that Shinji didn't like to hear very much; that he's a lot like his father in a key way. They both have made the decision that the entire rest of the world isn't as important to them as one particular woman and that life isn't worth living without her. Now," he said, leaning forward, "we again come to one of the ultimate questions; what do you want, Asuka?"

至于他有多认真，明日香，我希望你记住我妻子昨天对他说的话，真嗣对此并不太喜欢听；他在关键的一点上很像他的父亲。他们都决定，对于他们来说，世界上其他所有人都不如那一个特定的女人重要，没有她，生活就不值得过。现在，"他身体前倾，"我们再次面临一个终极问题；你想要什么，明日香？"

Asuka twitched faintly at the redirection of attention to her. "I... want to stay right here for a while. Then... I don't know." A tiny, twisted smile hesitantly crept onto her face. "Maybe slap Wondergirl in her stupid face again."

听到话题转向自己，明日香微微一颤。“我……想在这里待一会儿。然后……我不知道。”一丝扭曲的微笑犹豫地爬上她的脸庞。“或许再给那个奇迹女孩一巴掌。”

"Then may come dinner with your friends and family, later this evening at least," Daniel said. "And tomorrow, we'll watch the first parts of the Imperial Army division start deploying to your world. Beyond that, nothing is required of you. I want you two to be happy, but that is hardly a demand. What about you, Shinji? What do you want?"

"那么，至少今晚晚些时候，你可以和亲朋好友共进晚餐，"丹尼尔说。"而明天，我们将观看帝国军队分部开始部署到你们世界的第一部分。除此之外，你无需承担任何责任。我希望你们俩幸福，但这绝非命令。你呢，真嗣？你想要什么？"

'I want to go back to this morning. It was much nicer,' he thought. Out loud he said, "I want... I want Asuka to be happy. I want Rei to be happy. I want all my friends to be happy."

我想回到今天早上，那时候美好多了，他心想。他大声说道：“我希望……我希望明日香幸福。我希望绫波幸福。我希望我所有的朋友都幸福。”

"What about yourself? Don't you count?"

你自己呢？难道你不算数吗？

He shook his head. "If they're happy, I'll be too."

他摇了摇头。“如果他们幸福，我也会感到幸福。”

"You think they don't feel the same, Shinji?" Daniel replied. "When you are happy, they feel better too. You think it makes Asuka happy when you act all mopey?"

"你以为他们感受不到同样的情绪吗，真嗣？" 丹尼尔回答道，"当你快乐时，他们也会感觉更好。你认为你一副闷闷不乐的样子会让明日香开心吗？"

"I guess not," Shinji said quietly.

"我想不是吧，" 真嗣轻声说道。

"No more guessing Shinji. Uncertainty is what's tearing her up right now, and you as well. Asuka was very angry and accused you of never loving anyone seriously during Instrumentality. Do you think you not being serious would be a good thing right now?"

别再猜测了，真嗣。不确定性正是此刻让她和你都痛苦不堪的原因。明日香非常愤怒，在人类补完计划中指责你从未认真爱过任何人。你认为现在这种不认真的态度会是好事吗？

Asuka's grip squeezed him tighter. "No, it wouldn't," he admitted.

明日香的握力越发紧了。“不，不会的，”他承认道。

"So if you want to help Asuka and yourself right now, you need to be very serious about it, like you were this morning." He shifted his eyes down to the occupant of Shinji's lap. "Asuka, do you feel better yet?"

所以，如果你想现在帮助明日香也帮助你自己，你就得非常认真对待，就像你今天早上那样。”他目光下移，看向坐在真嗣腿上的人。“明日香，你现在感觉好些了吗？”

"A little." 一点点。

"Only a little? Tsk, Shinji. You are not fulfilling your orders to make her feel better. I think you need to step it up a notch."

"就这点儿？啧，真嗣。你并没有完全按照指令让她感觉好些。我觉得你得加把劲了。"

"How?" “怎么？”

Daniel flinched slightly at something and put a hand to the side of his head. "Ow. Alright, before half my children jump in with suggestions, I'm going to head them off with at least one of my own; You need to stand right up, put your right hand on your hip, your left hand in the air, and start signing the 'I'm A Little Teapot' song while Asuka throws pies at you and I play the accordion."

丹尼尔因某事微微一缩，用手捂住了头侧。“哎哟。好吧，在我一半的孩子们提出建议之前，我先来一个自己的主意；你得站直了，右手叉腰，左手举向空中，开始唱《我是一只小茶壶》，同时让明日香朝你扔派，我来弹手风琴。”

Shinji stared at him. Asuka's head came up off Shinji's chest and joined in. "What," they said flatly in stereo.

真嗣盯着他，而明日香也从真嗣的胸前抬起头来，一同加入。“什么？”他们异口同声地平淡回应。

Daniel rolled his eyes. "Well, hooray, your ears are still working, even if your brains are running a little behind. That was a joke, kids, although I bet it would probably get Asuka to laugh at you. Come on, Shinji. How did you make her feel better this morning?"

丹尼尔翻了个白眼。“好吧，万岁，你的耳朵还能用，尽管你的脑子有点跟不上。那是个笑话，孩子们，虽然我敢打赌这可能会让明日香嘲笑你。来吧，真嗣。你今天早上是怎么让她感觉好点的？”

"I held her like this."

我这样抱着她。

"And...?" "然后呢？"

"Um." Shinji turned a little red. So did Asuka. She did turn her head to face him, though, a hopeful look dawning on her face.

"嗯。" 真嗣的脸微微泛红。明日香也是。她转过头来面对他，脸上渐渐浮现出期待的表情。

Daniel stood up and started for the door. "I'm going to leave you two alone to ah, 'talk' for a while. Two last things, Shinji. One; in her whole life, there have been exactly four people Asuka has kissed. Only one of them was because she just wanted to. And two; consider the word 'yet'. Asuka? Just remember who you are. I'll see you in a couple hours." He closed the door behind him.

丹尼尔站起身，朝门口走去。“我要让你们俩单独待会儿，好好‘谈谈’。真嗣，最后两件事：一；在她的一生中，阿苏卡总共亲吻过四个人。其中只有一次是她真心想这么做。二；想想‘尚未’这个词。阿苏卡？记住你是谁。几小时后见。”他关上了门。

A more hopeful look grew on Shinji's face too. 'Because she just wanted to?' "Is what he said true, Asuka?"

真嗣的脸上也浮现出更加充满希望的神情。“因为她只是想这么做？”“他说的真的吗，明日香？”

"Baka." She slid one hand behind his head and pulled him closer. "You're supposed to be making me feel better. Orders." Just before their lips touched again, she whispered very softly, "And yes."

"笨蛋。" 她将一只手滑到他脑后，拉近他的距离。"你应该让我感觉好些的。命令。" 就在他们的唇再次相触之前，她极轻地耳语道，"还有，是的。"

**********************

"Aah...ahh...Ok, that's it, I'm done. You win. Just bury me here."

啊……啊……好了，就这样，我认输了。你赢了。就把我埋在这儿吧。

"Woohoo! Yes! Seventeen to six, plus a submission! Misato wins! Victory dance, victory dance! BH, beer me!"

哇哦！太棒了！十七比六，外加一次降服！美里赢了！胜利之舞，胜利之舞！BH，给我啤酒！

"How the Hell can you still move? I had no idea you could get more insatiable after college. BH, a glass of orange juice and an IV drip, please."

"见鬼，你怎么还能动？真没想到你大学毕业后更加贪得无厌了。BH，来杯橙汁，再加个点滴。"

"Um...wow. I mean...wow. That was...Um...C-c-c...I mean, H-Hikari?"

呃...哇。我是说...哇。那真是...呃...C-c-c...我是说，H-Hikari？

"Mmmm, yes, Su-...Touji?"

"嗯嗯，是的，苏...头儿？"

"Can...can we do that some more?"

"我们...我们能再来一次吗？"

"MMmmm, that sounds like a very nice idea."

"嗯嗯，听起来真是个不错的主意。"

"Wait, weren't we supposed to be doing something?"

“等等，我们不是应该做点什么吗？”

"I can't remember. Now c'mere."

我记不清了。现在过来吧。

### Chapter 19 Plans, Battles, & Knowing What You Want
第 19 章：计划、战斗与明确目标

Two and a half hours later, Asuka came up for air. She broke their kiss, but didn't pull her face away or open her eyes. "Thank you, Shinji. I think I feel a bit better now."  
两个半小时后，明日香终于抬起头来。她结束了他们的吻，但没有移开脸庞或睁开眼睛。“谢谢你，真嗣。我觉得我现在感觉好些了。”

"Yeah, me too," he replied just as softly.  
“嗯，我也是，”他同样轻声地回答。

_'Not as good as I'm feeling, I'd bet. If I don't stop us now, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to keep my hands outside your clothes, Ikari.'_ Out loud, she said, "He was right. I've always been able to just tell myself what to feel, what to think. Now, I don't know, I'm sorry Shinji."  
“我敢打赌，我现在的感觉比你好多了。如果我现在不阻止我们，我不知道还能坚持多久不把手伸进你的衣服里，真嗣。”她大声说道，“他说得对。我总是能告诉自己该有什么感觉，该想什么。现在，我不知道，对不起，真嗣。”

"We're both in unexplored territory, Asuka. You don't... have to tell me anything. What we're doing right now is more than I could have done anything but dream about a week ago."  
"我们都在未知的领域里，明日香。你不必……告诉我任何事。我们现在所做的，是我一周前只能梦想的事情。"

She cracked her eyes open a slit to peek at him. "Dream about, hmm?"  
她微微睁开眼睛偷看他。"梦想，嗯？"

"Ahh... let me put it this way; there were a few nights in Boston where I _didn't_ fall asleep thinking of you."  
"啊……这么说吧；在波士顿有几晚，我躺下时满脑子都是你。"

"Pervert. What happened to 'I know that ship has sailed'?" she asked a little archly.  
"变态。你说的'那艘船已经开走了'呢？"她略带挑衅地问道。

"I'd just kind of given up hoping. Not thinking."  
"我只是有点放弃了希望。不再去想。"

"How come you never tried to contact me or anything? Three years and all I ever heard was third-hand."  
"你怎么从来没试着联系我或什么的？三年了，我听到的全是二手消息。"

Shinji shrugged. "I _did_ try. Every day, right after you left, and at least a couple times a week later on. They'd never let me use any of the long-range communication systems, my emails never got a reply, and it's not like there's a reliable postal service anymore. I tried sending letters and stuff, but…" He shrugged helplessly.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我确实尝试过。每天，就在你离开之后，至少每周还有几次。他们从不让我使用任何远程通讯系统，我的邮件从未得到回复，而且现在也没有可靠的邮政服务了。我试着寄信和一些东西，但是……”他无奈地耸了耸肩。

_'And I never got a thing. Another little link in my chains, Winthrop? I spent three years damning Shinji every other night for something that wasn't his fault.'_ "Mm... nothing ever got through."  
“而我什么也没收到。这是我的又一条锁链吗，温斯洛普？我花了三年时间，每隔一晚就咒骂真嗣，尽管那不是他的错。”“嗯……什么也没传过来。”

"Did you try to reach me?" Shinji asked cautiously.  
“你尝试过联系我吗？”真嗣小心翼翼地问道。

"Not... a lot. I thought it was... I didn't want to hear from you, because I didn't know it was Winthrop's orders keeping you in Boston. I thought it was you, so I was pissed at you for... leaving me." Asuka winced internally. _'Great, I just managed to sound petty, bitchy, and stupid, all in one shot. Good job, Sohryu.'_  
"不是...很多。我以为那是...我不想听到你的消息，因为我不知道是温特沃斯的命令让你留在波士顿。我以为是你自己的决定，所以我对你...离开我感到很生气。" 明日香内心一紧。'太好了，我一下子显得小气、刻薄又愚蠢。干得漂亮，惣流。'

"'Asuka's mad at me, all's right with the world,'" Shinji joked. "That should be my personal motto."  
"'明日香对我生气了，世界又恢复正常了，'” 真嗣开玩笑地说。“这应该是我的个人座右铭。”

"Baka." Asuka said gently. "I... I'm sorry for blaming you for that, alright?"  
“笨蛋。”明日香温柔地说。“我...我为责怪你这件事道歉，好吗？”

Shinji just shrugged again. "You didn't know. And being angry at Winthrop probably wouldn't have been healthy. I'm kind of glad that I drew your blame, if it helped keep you safer."  
真嗣只是再次耸了耸肩。“你当时不知道。而且对温思罗普生气可能也不健康。如果我替你承担了责备能让你更安全，我其实挺高兴的。”

"You are such a martyr-wannabe, Third. You're not allowed to get yourself killed doing anything stupid, remember?" She poked him in the chest. "Just for that, it's your turn to apologize for something again. Try not to give me a heart attack like last time."  
“你真是个想当烈士的第三号，不许再做任何蠢事让自己丧命，记住了吗？”她戳了戳他的胸口。“就因为这个，你又得为某件事道歉了。别像上次那样让我心脏病发作。”

Shinji looked thoughtful for a minute, then hesitantly grinned. "I'm sorry I didn't pick up on your hints back then. We could have been doing this a lot sooner."  
真嗣沉思了一会儿，然后犹豫地笑了笑。“对不起，我当时没领会你的暗示。我们本可以更早就开始的。”

Asuka couldn't stop her grin in response. "See, that's much better. And that's what you get for being a baka; you miss out on the hotness." She luxuriantly stretched out and arched her back in his lap, making sure her chest went right past his face. Shinji's eyes were helplessly dragged along. _'Oh yes, this is fun. You are_ _**mine**__, Third Child. You can blow it out your ass, Wondergirl.'_ She almost jumped when she felt Shinji's hand run along under the arch of her spine. _'Oh, so you_ can _learn, Third. How nice.'_ She shivered happily.  
明日香忍不住露出了得意的笑容。“看吧，这样好多了。这就是你当笨蛋的下场；错过了我的魅力。”她慵懒地在他腿上伸展身体，背部优雅地弯曲，确保自己的胸部正好从他脸前掠过。真嗣的目光不由自主地被吸引。“哦，没错，这很有趣。你是我的，第三适格者。你那点小心思就留着吧，奇迹少女。”她几乎要跳起来，当她感觉到真嗣的手沿着她脊椎的弧度滑过时。“哦，看来你也能学乖，第三。真不错。”她快乐地颤抖着。

Another attempted boil of _'You don't deserve this'_ was easier to push down now that it had the First Child's face associated with it. But it was enough to bring Asuka down from considering spending another hour in hedonistic enjoyment and back to thinking about the more serious topics that had landed them sitting on the couch. "I'm sorry I don't know yet, Shinji. You 'wanted to try with me' to see if you could be happy? Well, I... want to... find out... um..." _'God damn it, Sohryu, if you pussy out on this, I will jump out of your skull and kill you myself!' 'Wait, you're my own brain, how does that even work?' 'Shut up! I'll find a way! Now keep going!'_ "...what... the answer is to the question. That you asked me. Earlier." Suddenly it was very _hard_ to look him in the eye. _'No! No it isn't! I am Asuka Langley Sohryu! I am not afraid of anything! ...except maybe this. No! I am not wimping out in front of Shinji! If he can do this, I can!'_ She forced her head up.  
又一次试图涌出的‘你不配拥有这个’变得更容易压制了，现在它与长子的面孔联系在一起。但这足以让明日香从考虑再沉迷享乐一小时的想法中抽离，回到那些让他们坐在沙发上的更严肃话题上。“对不起，我还不知道，真嗣。你‘想和我试试’看看是否能快乐？嗯，我……想……找出……呃……”‘该死，惣流，如果你在这事上退缩，我会从你脑子里跳出来亲手宰了你！’‘等等，你是我自己的大脑，这怎么可能？’‘闭嘴！我会找到办法的！现在继续！’“……什么……是那个问题的答案。你之前问我的。”突然间，直视他的眼睛变得异常困难。‘不！不是这样的！我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！我什么都不怕！……除了这个。不！我不会在真嗣面前退缩的！如果他能做到，我也能！’她强迫自己抬起头。

Shinji was looking at her with a combination of surprise and ...apprehension? He swallowed nervously, but met her gaze, and said, "Me too."  
真嗣看着她，眼神中混合着惊讶和……忧虑？他紧张地咽了咽口水，但迎上了她的目光，说道：“我也是。”

Asuka laid her head back down on his shoulder. "Say it again," she asked quietly. "Please."  
明日香将头靠回他的肩上。“再说一遍，”她轻声请求，“请。”

He smiled. "I love you, Asuka."  
他微笑着。“我爱你，明日香。”

"Good." "很好。"

They both might have happily sat there for a good deal longer, but both their interface bands started to buzz. Asuka frowned and tapped hers. "Hello?"  
他们本可以愉快地在那里多坐一会儿，但两人的接口带突然开始嗡嗡作响。明日香皱了皱眉，轻敲自己的接口带。“喂？”

"Good afternoon, Pilots," Rayana's voice greeted them. "Are you two done 'talking' enough to be ready for the campaign planning meeting yet? We're just waiting for you."  
"下午好，飞行员们，" 雷安娜的声音向他们问候。"你们俩聊够了没？准备好参加作战计划会议了吗？我们正等着你们呢。"

Asuka grumbled at the interruption of the nicest afternoon she'd had in too long, but said, "Yes, I suppose. Where do we need to go?"  
明日香对这个打断她许久未有的美好下午感到不满，但还是说："是的，我想是的。我们需要去哪儿？"

"Misato and Kaji's cabin. Sit tight, we'll have you here in a moment."  
"美里和加持的小屋。稍等，我们马上就到。"

"Wait, what? Hold on a s-" The world went electric blue and fuzzy again. "-econd! We're not... scheiße."  
"等等，什么？等一下——" 世界再次变成电光蓝和模糊一片。"——秒！我们不是... 该死。"

She was still sitting in Shinji's lap on the couch, but now it was the couch in Misato and Kaji's cabin. They, Touji & Hikari, and Daniel & Rayana were in the other couches and seats around the cocktail table, watching them appear. Even the final member of Shinji's old Stooges, Kensuke, had somehow joined in. Silence reigned for a moment as their friends took in their rather surprising seating arrangement. Then Misato started laughing, Kensuke's jaw dropped, and Touji & Hikari turned red.  
她仍然坐在真嗣的腿上，但现在是坐在美里和加持的小屋里的沙发上。他们，剑介和光，还有丹尼尔和瑞亚娜，都坐在周围的沙发和椅子上，看着他们出现。甚至连真嗣以前的“三傻”中的最后一位，健介，也不知怎么地加入了进来。朋友们对他们的意外坐姿沉默了一会儿。然后美里开始笑，健介的下巴掉了下来，剑介和光脸红了。

Asuka went even redder as she rapidly made sure her clothes were still decently arranged, scooted out of Shinji's lap, and onto the couch to sit next to him. "A little more warning would have been nice!" she grated at the Empress.  
明日香的脸更红了，她迅速确认自己的衣服还算整齐，从真嗣的腿上挪开，坐到沙发上挨着他。"如果能提前一点警告就好了！"她对女皇咬牙切齿地说。

Rayana had a small, unrepentant smile. "I asked if you were ready, and you said 'yes'."  
瑞亚娜露出了一个微小却毫无悔意的微笑。“我问你是否准备好了，你回答‘是的’。”

"It would have been nicer to know we were about to be in public! What if we'd bee- shutting up now." Asuka tried not to turn completely as red as her hair.  
“要是早知道我们即将在公共场合，那就更好了！万一我们被蜜蜂——现在闭嘴。”明日香努力不让自己的脸红得像她的头发一样。

"Nicer maybe, but not nearly as funny," Daniel chuckled. "Don't worry. To be fair, next time we'll do it to Touji and Hikari."  
“或许更好，但绝对没这么有趣，”丹尼尔轻笑道，“别担心。公平起见，下次我们就对真治和光这么做。”

The named pair blushed in stereo and Kensuke's head snapped around to them, jaw still on the floor. "Not you too!" he bleated. He noticed for the first time that they were quietly holding hands between them on their couch. He looked around and noticed that he was the only single person in the room beside Lieutenant Leibshott. "Oh, man... if I stay here two days am I going to end up with a girl next to me too? ...wait, that doesn't sound like a bad deal." He looked at the curvy Lieutenant and smiled hopefully.  
那对公认的情侣双双脸红，同步得如同立体声，这让剑介的头猛地转向他们，下巴还惊得合不拢。“连你们也这样！”他哀叹道。他这才注意到，他们正悄悄地在沙发上手牵手。他环顾四周，发现自己竟是房间里除了莱布肖特中尉外唯一的单身汉。“哦，天哪……我要是再待两天，会不会身边也多了个女孩？……等等，这听起来好像还不错。”他看向那位曲线玲珑的中尉，满怀希望地笑了。

Ching snorted. "Not me, kid. You're a few hundred years too early to try for me. And I'm worried you might start leg-humping my mecha." She turned to Shinji. "Your friend here volunteered to join the campaign as a mecha pilot before the Emperor had even finished the sentence. Then he started drooling once he found out what he'd be piloting."  
青子嗤笑一声。“别打我的主意，小子。你还早了几百年呢。我担心你可能会开始对我机甲的腿部发情。”她转向真嗣。“你这位朋友在皇帝还没说完话之前就自告奋勇要加入机甲驾驶员的行列。然后一听说自己要驾驶什么，就开始流口水了。”

Asuka barked a laugh. "Ha! You haven't changed at all, geek."  
明日香大笑出声。“哈！你一点都没变，书呆子。”

Kensuke's enthusiasm was undiminished by Asuka's sarcasm. "They're going to give me my own mecha! An Imperial Army _M-269 Black Knight Mk. VII_! Sixty meters of mecha-awesome! I think I've died and gone to Heaven!"  
尽管受到明日香的讽刺，健介的热情丝毫未减。“他们要给我自己的机甲了！帝国陆军 M-269 黑骑士 Mk. VII 型！六十米的机甲巨人！我觉得我已经死了，上了天堂！”

"Yes, yes, I've already got my own mecha. It's an Imperial Navy _StarStrider_. Much bigger," Asuka mercilessly informed the Stooge. "And it's red, of course."  
“是啊，是啊，我已经有自己的机甲了。是帝国海军的星际漫步者。大得多，”明日香无情地告诉那个跟班。“当然，还是红色的。”

Kensuke turned a hurt look on Daniel. "Sorry, Aida-kun. She's the combat-experienced Pilot here. And if you're in on this campaign, she and Shinji are going to be your joint commanders as well," he said. "Don't worry, this is going to be a mostly Army affair, so there will be whole squadrons of _Black Knight_s for you to fall in with."  
健介转向丹尼尔，露出受伤的表情。“抱歉，相田君。她是这里战斗经验丰富的驾驶员。如果你参与这次行动，她和真嗣将是你的联合指挥官，”他说。“别担心，这主要是陆军的事务，所以会有整队的黑骑士让你加入。”

Kensuke looked shocked. "The Red Demon is going to be my commander? Oh no..."  
健介看起来震惊了。“红魔将成为我的指挥官？哦不……”

Asuka's smile grew vicious. "And I will rule with an iron fist! No mercy for slacking perverts!" she crowed.  
明日香的笑容变得狰狞。“我将用铁腕统治！对偷懒的变态绝不宽容！”她得意地喊道。

"'All will love me, and despair', Asuka?" Rayana raised an eyebrow. "Or are you going for a more blood-soaked-barbarian-queen vibe?"  
“‘所有人都会爱我，并绝望’，明日香？”雷亚娜挑了挑眉。“还是说你想要更血腥野蛮女王的风格？”

Daniel gave Rayana a quelling look as he interrupted the spiraling argument. "In either case, Second Lieutenant Aida has already accepted a commission on the Imperial Army. Rather alarmingly quickly, in fact. He's had the same quick brief-in that your other friends got earlier. Fill him in on the rest as you care to. We'd like to give you all a briefing on the overall campaign plan the 791st Independent Division plans shop has worked up. They're the unit that will be under your control. The first units will start setting up camp on your Earth tomorrow morning. In a few days, you all will head over to get acquainted and start on the more detailed work for the first moves, as well as get you two," he pointed to Shinji and Asuka, "inserted back in to your fleet that was about to depart Marseille. The time it takes your fleet to cross the Atlantic will give the 791st plenty of opportunity to have a good chunk of South America already under control by the time you two 'publicly' land. You won't be missing out, though. We're setting up a quick covert transport line so you two can still be a part of it while you're still 'officially' at sea."  
丹尼尔用一个制止的眼神打断了愈演愈烈的争论，对拉亚娜说道：“无论如何，二等兵艾达已经接受了帝国军队的委任。实际上，速度快得令人惊讶。他接受了与你们其他朋友之前相同的快速简报。至于剩下的细节，你愿意的话可以给他补充。我们希望就 791 独立师计划部制定的总体作战方案给你们做一个简报。他们将是受你们指挥的部队。第一批部队将于明早开始在你们地球上搭建营地。几天后，你们将前往熟悉情况，并开始为首次行动做更详细的准备工作，同时让你们两位”，他指向真嗣和明日香，“重新回到即将离开马赛港的舰队中。你们的舰队横渡大西洋的时间将给 791 师足够的机会，让南美洲的大部分地区在你们两位‘公开’登陆前就已处于控制之下。不过你们不会错过行动。我们正在建立一条快速的秘密运输线，这样你们两位在‘官方’航行期间仍能参与其中。”

He paused and tapped his interface band. Another cloud of sparks lit up behind him and became the form of a short, red-skinned humanoid in a dark green uniform. "This is Senior Colonel of the Blue Istvaaz Mu-Bulegtia'nshok, the 791st Division's Chief of Plans. He'll be giving you the overview of what there is planned so far." The officer nodded politely. "Proceed, Colonel, if you please."  
他停顿了一下，轻敲自己的界面带。他身后又亮起一片火花，逐渐形成一个身穿深绿色制服的红色皮肤矮小类人形生物。“这位是蓝星斯特瓦兹高级上校穆-布勒格提亚'恩肖克，第 791 师计划处处长。他将向您概述目前计划的概况。”这位军官礼貌地点头。“请继续，上校。”

"Yes, Your Majesty." He touched his wrist, and a detailed map of the River Plate region sprang to life on the table. "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our base of operations will be here, fifty kilometers north-northwest of the remains of Buenos Aires..."  
“是的，陛下。”他轻触手腕，一张详细的拉普拉塔河流域地图随即在桌上跃然呈现。“下午好，女士们先生们。我们的行动基地将设在这里，布宜诺斯艾利斯废墟西北偏北五十公里处……”

The briefing took hours. Asuka and Misato took it all in easily, but when Kaji noted Shinji, Hikari, and Touji struggling to keep up, he wisely asked for and got digital tablets handed to everyone for note-taking and individual explanation sidebars. They needed them; recon reports, suggested approaches for gaining control of what few population centers still existed, assessments of various warlords' forces, and more bombarded them. Misato and Asuka drank it in, one by training and experience, the other by native intelligence. The rest kept up as best they could, but knew who would be the ones with the knowledge to call the plays. Even Ryoji shook his head at how easily Misato absorbed the torrent of information. He'd always been more on the intelligence and espionage side than main force combat, and this was definitely Misato's field.  
简报持续了数小时。明日香和美里轻松吸收了所有信息，但当加持注意到真嗣、光和冬二努力跟上进度时，他明智地要求并获得了数字平板电脑，分发给每个人用于做笔记和个别解释。他们确实需要这些；侦察报告、夺取少数仍存人口中心的建议方案、各路军阀势力的评估，以及其他大量信息不断涌来。美里和明日香如饥似渴地吸收着，一个凭借训练和经验，另一个则依靠天生的智慧。其余人尽力跟上，但心里清楚谁将掌握决策所需的知识。连凉二都摇头感叹美里吸收信息的速度之快。他一直更偏向情报和间谍活动而非主力战斗，这无疑是美里的强项。

Extensive equipment in non-lethal gear was covered. Sonic stunners, sleep- and paralysis-inducing chemical agents, hypnotic and psionic immobilizers, an entire array of items to provide alternatives to the division's even wider selection of energy and kinetic weapons. But the combination of non-lethal gear and shows of force built into the plan made Daniel's promise to aim for a 'Nobody Dies' scenario more possible than Asuka would have thought. Even her _Red Whirlwind_ could carry a large-scale sonic stunner or neural-induction-flechette anti-personnel cannon as a rifle-pod.  
大量非致命装备被涵盖其中。声波震撼器、催眠与麻痹化学剂、催眠与心灵控制固定器，以及一系列为替代部门更广泛的能量与动能武器而设的替代品。然而，计划中非致命装备与武力展示的结合，使得丹尼尔承诺追求的“无人丧生”情景比明日香原先所想的更具可行性。即便是她的红旋风，也能搭载大规模声波震撼器或神经诱导飞镖反人员加农炮作为步枪吊舱。

_'Well, that ought to make Shinji happier,'_ Asuka thought as she finally laid her tablet aside at the end. Colonel Mu-Bulegtia'nshok had wrapped up his briefing and departed with a short bow to the party. _'And I won't have to worry about restraining the urge to punch him in the head in the middle of a battle again.'_ They wouldn't fight without a couple of familiar faces along with them, either; both Kensuke and Touji had signed on as Pilots, and Hikari as well, though in a support capacity rather than as a combatant. Touji had been less reluctant once the non-lethal tactics planned had been laid out for him. He'd fight for his friends, but he was almost as hesitant to kill as Shinji.  
“嗯，这应该会让真嗣更开心些。”明日香在最后终于把平板电脑放在一边时想道。穆-布莱格提亚上校已经结束了他的简报，向众人微微鞠躬后离开了。“而且我也不用再担心在战斗中忍不住想揍他脑袋的冲动了。”他们也不会在没有几个熟悉面孔的情况下作战；健介和阿薰都签约成为驾驶员，光也是，尽管是以支援而非战斗的身份。阿薰在得知计划中的非致命战术后，就不那么犹豫了。他会为朋友而战，但他几乎和真嗣一样不愿杀人。

Asuka should have expected the next attack. Almost as soon as the Colonel had departed, an evil grin had started to grow on Misato's face. Their former guardian never missed a chance to stir up this variety of trouble when the three of them had all lived together, when relations between her and Shinji had never been even half as good as they were now. And now that there _was…_ something, it was just fuel for the fire. "Ne, Asuka, so what _were_ you and Shin-chan up to just before Rayana called?"  
明日香本该预料到接下来的攻击。几乎在上校刚离开，美里脸上就露出了邪恶的笑容。他们曾经的监护人从不放过任何一次制造这种麻烦的机会，尤其是在他们三人同住时，她和真嗣的关系从未像现在这样好过。而现在有了……某种情况，这无疑是火上浇油。“呐，明日香，雷亚娜打电话之前，你和真嗣在做什么呢？”

Asuka rapidly fought her blush as much as she could and rallied her counterattack. "Oh, not much. Nothing near what I'm sure you two were up to. Nice new hairstyle."  
明日香迅速压制住自己的脸红，发起反击。“哦，没什么。肯定比不上你们俩在忙的事。新发型不错。”

Misato's hair was certainly not in its usually sleek and smooth style. It was considerably wilder, and looked like she'd hastily brushed it back into shape with her fingers after falling out of bed. "Er, when you're older..." Misato's rebuttal ran headfirst into the new reality. Her former charges _were_ older. Her favorite counter no longer had any bite. Asuka's sneer let her newly engaged opponent know she'd scented the weakness.  
美里头发显然没有平时那么光滑柔顺，显得相当凌乱，像是起床后匆匆用手指梳理过。“呃，等你长大点……”美里的反驳直接撞上了新的现实。她曾经照顾的孩子们已经长大了。她最喜欢的回击不再有威力。明日香的一丝冷笑让她的新对手知道，她已经察觉到了弱点。

"Ladies, please! Wait!" Daniel interrupted. He reached behind the couch he and Rayana were sitting on and retrieved a large bowl of popcorn. He placed it in his lap and Rayana took a handful. "Alright, continue."  
“女士们，请稍等！”丹尼尔打断道。他从沙发后面拿出一碗爆米花，放在腿上，雷亚娜抓了一把。“好了，继续吧。”

Asuka dove right back at it. "Yes, we _are_ older, Misato. Shinji and I have been sleeping together for a month now. He made me breakfast in bed this morning. It was very nice. I got out of the shower before he could help wash my back, though he did offer. Has Kaji-san done something similar for you today?"  
明日香立刻回击道：“是的，我们年纪大了，美里。真嗣和我已经同居一个月了。他今天早上还给我做了床上的早餐，非常贴心。虽然他提出要帮我洗背，但我先洗完澡了。加治先生今天为你做过类似的事吗？”

Misato's eyes widened at this. She glanced at Kaji for a moment. "Ah, no, he hasn't." She faced Asuka again and tried again. "But we've been very busy enjoying the benefits of being properly engaged and back together. There's eight years of missing out to catch up on! I'm just worried you're going to set a bad example for your friends, who are still so much younger." Misato smiled after that sally.  
美里听到这话，眼睛瞪大了。她瞥了加治一眼，“啊，没有。”她再次面对明日香，试图解释：“但我们一直忙于享受正式订婚和重归于好的好处。我们有八年的空白要弥补！我只是担心你会给你的朋友们树立不好的榜样，他们还那么年轻。”美里说完后笑了笑。

Asuka snorted dismissively. "Who, geek-Stooge with no girlfriend?" Asuka ignored Kensuke's hurt "Hey!" "Or jock-Stooge and the Class Representative, who's more proper than that? And Ching isn't younger than I am."  
明日香不屑地哼了一声。“谁，没有女朋友的书呆子斯托伊？”明日香无视了真希的受伤的“嘿！”“还是那个比那更正经的班长和体育生斯托伊？而且青并不比我年轻。”

"Ooh, powerful counter by Germany! And she scored some bonus points off the new kid too!" Daniel mock-muttered to Rayana.  
"哦，德国队的反击真有力！还顺便从新来的孩子那里赚了些额外分数！" 丹尼尔向拉亚娜打趣道。

Hikari spoke up. "I know we're still just kids now compared to you and Shinji, I mean, you're four years older, sleeping in the same bed, and he offers to wash your back in the shower?! That's so... so... adult!"  
光开口了。"我知道我们现在和你们比还是孩子，我是说，你们大了四岁，睡在同一张床上，他还在洗澡时主动提出帮你洗背？！这真是...太...成人了！"

Asuka smirked triumphantly. "Yeah, well, it took us a while to get things settled, but..."  
明日香得意地笑了。"是啊，虽然我们花了些时间才安定下来，但是..."

Hikari kept going. "And I couldn't let you get _that_ far ahead, no matter what. So after you all left I tied Touji up and for the last few hours rode him like he's my little pony. Three times. Did you ever think he'd be a screamer?"  
光继续说道。“而且我不能让你跑那么远，无论如何都不行。所以在你们都离开后，我把真嗣绑了起来，在过去的几个小时里像骑小马一样骑着他。三次。你有没有想过他会是个尖叫者？”

Asuka's jaw dropped further than Kensuke's had when they arrived. So did Misato's, Ryoji's, and Shinji's. Daniel and Rayana had more popcorn. Ching just raised an eyebrow and softly said, "Really? Fast work, Horaki-san." Touji's face flared almost incandescent and couldn't look up from his shoes.  
明日香的嘴巴张得比他们刚到时健介的还要大。美里、加持和真嗣也是如此。丹尼尔和瑞亚娜又抓了一把爆米花。青只是挑了挑眉毛，轻声说道：“真的吗？动作真快，班长。”真嗣的脸几乎红得发亮，不敢抬头看自己的鞋子。

Asuka tried to get her mouth to close. "Hi-...Hi-...Hikari?!"  
明日香试图合上嘴巴。“光...光...光？!”

Hikari let her hang for a minute, then grinned. "Gotcha." She broke up laughing.  
光让她们挂了一会儿，然后咧嘴一笑。“抓到你了。”她笑得前仰后合。

"And that's a solid hit and a game point for Horaki! Payback! Japan's second team is back in the game! Team Katsuragi's early attack ran into stiff resistance, but maybe they'll have better luck in the next round," Rayana commented from the sidelines.  
“这一击稳稳命中，为洞木赢得了比赛点！复仇成功！日本二队重回赛场！葛城队的早期进攻遭遇了顽强抵抗，但也许下一轮他们会更幸运，”雷亚娜在场边评论道。

"Ne, Shinji-kun, so it looks like you and Asuka-chan are a bit closer than you were just yesterday?" Kaji asked with a smile. "Breakfast in bed, offering to wash her back? Seems you didn't need my advice after all."  
“呐，真嗣君，看来你和明日香的关系比昨天更近了一步？”加持笑着问道，“床上早餐，主动帮她洗背？看来你根本不需要我的建议嘛。”

"Um, yes," Shinji mumbled into his lap. "We... talked. It was a good morning." He shyly smiled at Asuka.  
"嗯，是的，" 真嗣喃喃地对着自己的膝盖说。"我们... 聊了聊。那是个美好的早晨。" 他羞涩地对明日香笑了笑。

"Yeah, it was pretty nice." Asuka rolled her eyes. "Wondergirl was a giant bitch and tried to ruin it, though."  
"是啊，挺不错的。" 明日香翻了个白眼。"不过三无少女真是大混蛋，差点毁了这一切。"

"You talked to Rei-chan? Where? What happened?" Misato asked.  
"你和丽聊了？在哪里？发生了什么？" 美里问道。

"We took Dr. Ikari, Shinji, and Asuka to make contact with her a few hours ago, feel her out about retrieving humanity from the Ring, and tell her that Dr. Ikari considered her a daughter, among other things. It... didn't go as well as we could have hoped. She ah... objected to how Asuka had treated Shinji in the past, and such," Daniel said delicately.  
"我们几小时前带了碇博士、真嗣和明日香去与她接触，试探她关于从环带中拯救人类的意愿，并告诉她碇博士视她如女儿，以及其他一些事情。结果...并不如我们期望的那样顺利。她啊...对明日香过去对待真嗣的方式表示反对，以及其他一些情况，" 丹尼尔小心翼翼地说道。

"Blue-haired _bitch_ said I didn't deserve him!" Asuka growled. "That all I'd do was hurt him! That _she'd_ take care of him. Over my dead body!" She possessively grabbed on to Shinji's arm. _'He's mine! My Shi...fuck. I still can't even think it to myself, let alone say it out loud. You're pathetic, Sohryu. ...He's still mine. You can't take him, Wondergirl. I don't care what you say about my being 'closed up'.'_  
"那个蓝毛婊子说我配不上他！" 明日香咆哮道，"她说我只会伤害他！说她会照顾他。除非我死了！" 她占有性地抓住了真嗣的手臂。'他是我的！我的真...该死。我甚至都无法在心里想，更别说大声说出来了。你真可悲，惣流。...他还是我的。你抢不走他，奇迹少女。我才不在乎你怎么说我是'封闭'的。'

"Nagisa-san was also there. He seemed in a bit better mood. We asked him to try to convince Ayanami-san to play nice. We'll try again tomorrow. We're going to need their help if we're to get everyone out of the Ring of Souls smoothly," Daniel continued. "In any case, we've got your respective families retrieved from the Ring individually or resurrected in the case of your parents. They're all being settled in on Second Chance, and I'd bet you'd like to get a chance to visit before tonight."  
渚君也在那里。他看起来心情稍微好些了。我们请他试着说服绫波同学友好相处。明天我们会再试一次。如果我们想顺利让所有人离开灵魂之环，我们需要他们的帮助。" 丹尼尔继续说道，"无论如何，我们已经将你们的家人从灵魂之环中救出，或者在你们父母的情况下复活了。他们都在‘第二次机会’上安顿下来，我敢打赌你们今晚之前会想去看望一下。"

Touji, Hikari, and Kensuke sat up excitedly. Misato, her father already returned to her last night, kept her cool enough to ask, "What happens tonight?"  
阿薰、光和健介兴奋地坐了起来。美里，她的父亲昨晚已经回来了，保持冷静地问道："今晚会发生什么？"

Rayana smiled. "You all get to dress up fancy again. 2200, you are all invited to the 791st Division Departure Ball, and your commissioning ceremonies. Your new dress uniforms, if you'd like them over other formal wear, will be at your cabins. This is officially a social occasion, so it's your choice for whatever you think flatters you more."  
拉亚娜微笑道："你们又要盛装打扮了。2200 点，你们都受邀参加第 791 师团的告别舞会和授衔仪式。如果你们愿意，新的礼服制服会放在你们的舱房里。这正式是一个社交场合，所以你们可以选择任何你们认为更适合自己的服装。"

"In the meantime, say hello to your families, and welcome back from the undiscovered country all your once lost relatives. Lieutenant Leibshott will take you all to the site on Second Chance where you can link up with them," Daniel said, waving her forward.  
"与此同时，向你们的家人问好，并欢迎你们所有曾经失去的亲人从那未被发现的国家归来。莱布肖特中尉将带你们前往‘第二次机会’的地点与他们汇合，"丹尼尔说道，示意她上前。

"All aboard, next flight leaving immediately," Ching quipped. The three youngest guests eagerly crowded over to her. Misato and Kaji were still seated. "They picked up your mother from just before the Second Impact hit, Major. Don't you think you should introduce your intended to her?"  
"全体登机，下一班航班立即出发，"青打趣道。三位最年轻的客人急切地围拢到她身边。美里和加持还坐在那里。"他们在第二次冲击发生前接到了你的母亲，少校。你不觉得你应该把你未婚夫介绍给她吗？"

Misato blinked. "Mom?" She sprang to her feet, and hauled her fiancé upright as well. "Let's go!" She dragged him over to the group and waited impatiently as Ching spoke into her interface band. A mass of sparks and they were gone.  
美里眨了眨眼。"妈妈？"她猛地站起身，也把她的未婚夫拉了起来。"我们走吧！"她拽着他走到人群中，不耐烦地等待着青通过她的接口带说话。一阵火花闪过，他们消失了。

"Considering he may have been the worst dad out of your whole group, we've left your father alone for now, Asuka," Daniel said. "Let us know what you want done later."  
“考虑到他可能是你们所有人中最糟糕的父亲，我们暂时没有打扰你的父亲，明日香，”丹尼尔说。“稍后告诉我们你希望怎么处理。”

"And when the group includes Ikari Gendo, that's saying something," Rayana said. "Gendo was at least a bad man trying to do good, just really badly. Pieter Langley had no such excuse. I mean, cheating on your mom in the next room with the doctor? Being married to her by your mother's funeral? Abandoning you after that? Say the word, and I'll smite the piss out of him."  
“而且这个团体里还包括碇源堂，这么说来可不简单，”雷亚娜说。“碇源堂至少是个试图做好事的坏人，只是做得非常糟糕。皮特·兰利可没有这样的借口。我是说，在你妈妈隔壁房间和医生偷情？在她葬礼那天和她结婚？之后又抛弃了你？只要你说一声，我就会狠狠教训他一顿。”

_'Oh yes, my wonderful and supportive father, who ditched Mama before she was even gone, and me before she was two weeks in the ground. He can rot in Hell in the cell next to Shinji's father. They can swap 'cheating on your child's mother' tips.'_ "He can stay wherever the Hell he is now. He'll get all the care from me that he gave my mother and I," she said rather bitterly.  
“哦，是的，我那美妙且支持我的父亲，妈妈还没走他就抛弃了她，我还没过两周他就离开了。他可以和真嗣的父亲一起在地狱里腐烂。他们可以交流‘如何背叛你孩子的母亲’的经验。”“他现在爱待哪儿就待哪儿。我会给他和我母亲一样的待遇，”她相当苦涩地说。

"Fair enough," Daniel said. "On another parental front, we held off Dr. Ikari earlier with the promise you'd talk to her later, once you two had some time alone. Feel up to knocking that out now?"  
“说得有理，”丹尼尔说道，“在另一个家长问题上，我们之前用你会稍后和她单独谈谈的承诺拖住了碇医生。现在准备好去解决这件事了吗？”

'_That oh-so-lovely awkward chat with my might-possibly-be-my-boyfriend's mother, sure, that'd be just dandy!'_ Asuka sighed. "Not really, but I doubt I'll feel better anytime soon, so let's get it over with. Let's go." She grasped Shinji's had firmly. _'And I really don't want to even try it without baka-Shinji with me.'_  
“和可能是我男朋友的妈妈进行那场尴尬至极的对话，当然，那真是太棒了！”明日香叹了口气，“其实并不想，但我怀疑自己短时间内也不会感觉好些，所以还是赶紧搞定吧。走吧。”她紧紧握住真嗣的手，“而且我真的不想在没有笨蛋真嗣的情况下尝试。”

Asuka stood up and took one step before her brain caught up with her last thought. She stopped dead. _'Wait, what the_ _**fuck**_ _did I just think?'_  
明日香站起来迈出一步，随后她的思绪才跟上刚才的想法。她突然停住，“等等，我刚刚到底在想什么鬼东西？”

Shinji stopped beside her. "Asuka?" He looked at her shocked expression. "What is it?"  
真嗣停在她身边。“明日香？”他看着她震惊的表情。“怎么了？”

_'Flurgen. Scheiße, what do I say?'_ Asuka scrabbled for something. "You're coming with me, right?" _'Close enough.'_  
‘弗尔根。该死，我该说什么？’明日香急忙寻找着话题。“你要跟我一起去，对吧？”‘差不多吧。’

Shinji looked at her a little funny. "Of course. Where else would I go?"  
真嗣有点奇怪地看着她。“当然。我还能去哪儿？”

Asuka just jerked brief nod. "Right." She faced their hosts again. "Ready when you are."  
明日香只是简短地点了点头。“好的。”她再次面对他们的主人。“随时可以开始。”

Daniel put the popcorn bowl down on the table and stood up with Rayana. "Don't look quite so tense, Asuka. This _probably_ won't be the worst 'meet the parents' moment we've seen, and we've seen some weird ones."  
丹尼尔把爆米花碗放在桌上，和瑞亚娜一起站了起来。“别那么紧张，明日香。这可能不会是我们见过的最糟糕的‘见家长’时刻，我们见过一些奇怪的。”

"Most of them didn't involve a crazy father that tried to end the world, I bet," Shinji muttered.  
“我打赌，大多数都没涉及一个试图毁灭世界的疯狂父亲，”真嗣低声说道。

"You're not the first one for that, either." Rayana snapped her fingers, and the world jumped around them.  
“你也不是第一个为此而来的。”雷亚娜打了个响指，周围的世界随之跳跃变换。

They were out on a beach again, in front of another cabin like their own. Rayana pointed them toward the umbrella-covered table nearby, while Daniel headed inside. "Have a seat. We'll bring your mother out. I think it's best if your father doesn't make an appearance just right now. Your mother has sort of placed him under 'house arrest'."  
他们又一次来到了海滩上，面前是另一间类似他们自己的小屋。雷亚娜指引他们走向附近的遮阳伞桌，而丹尼尔则走进了屋内。“请坐。我们会把你们的母亲带出来。我想现在最好让你父亲暂时不要露面。你们的母亲已经把他软禁在家里了。”

"That's fine," Shinji said, low and angry.  
“那很好，”真嗣低沉而愤怒地说。

"Hmm... I'm not going to argue too hard for you to forgive you father in any way, Shinji. I'm very much with you on this. But my husband would, so I'll play devil's advocate in his stead for a moment," Rayana said. "In worlds where he never lost your mother, Ikari Gendo was a pretty good father. He turned all his calculating, secret-planning ways to looking after you and your sisters. _Your_ father was convinced that no one could love him and that he would only hurt you, so he sent you as far from him as he could. He wasn't _trying_ to hurt you. He's just a mess as a human being."  
“嗯……我不会太强烈地要求你原谅你父亲，真嗣。在这点上我完全支持你。但我的丈夫会这么做，所以我会暂时扮演一下魔鬼的代言人，”雷亚娜说。“在那些他没有失去你母亲的世界里，碇源堂是个相当不错的父亲。他把所有计算和秘密策划的方式都用来照顾你和你的姐妹们。你父亲深信没有人会爱他，而他只会伤害你们，所以他尽可能地把你们送得离他远些。他并不是想伤害你。他只是作为一个普通人很混乱。”

"He managed to hurt me plenty anyhow," Shinji coldly retorted. "He'll have to do better than _good intentions_ after everything he did to us."  
“反正他还是让我伤透了心，”真嗣冷冷地反驳道，“经历了他给我们带来的一切，光有善意是不够的。”

Rayana shrugged. "Like I said, you'll get no argument from me. I'm still in favor of setting him aflame and letting him burn until he learns better behavior. My spoony love would insist on the effort, though. Good afternoon, Doctor Ikari."  
雷亚娜耸了耸肩，“就像我说的，你不会从我这里听到反对意见。我还是赞成把他点着，让他烧到学会规矩为止。不过，我那痴情的爱人会坚持要他付出努力。伊卡里医生，下午好。”

Yui Ikari sat down at the table with them. "Good afternoon, Your Majesty. Hello, Shinji, Asuka." She tapped her fingers on the table for a moment. "Ah... from what I can remember of my brief part of Instrumentality, you two weren't exactly getting along very well. Then this morning I hear you say Shinji told you he loves you, and you seemed pretty happy about it." She looked at Asuka calmly, but with great force behind it. "His father made quite a mess of raising him, or not, really. And I know that by the Third Impact he was very unhappy. I can't imagine life on Earth after that was easy. So I want to know, as his mother, just what are you doing with my son?"  
碇唯坐到了他们桌旁，“陛下，下午好。真嗣，明日香，你们好。”她用手指轻敲着桌面片刻，“啊……根据我对融合过程中短暂片段的记忆，你们俩当时相处得并不融洽。然后今天早上我听到你说真嗣告诉你他爱你，你似乎对此很高兴。”她平静地看着明日香，但目光中蕴含着强大的力量，“他的父亲在抚养他这件事上确实搞得一团糟，或者说根本没怎么抚养。我知道在第三次冲击后他非常不快乐。我无法想象地球上的生活在那之后会有多艰难。所以，作为他的母亲，我想知道，你究竟打算怎么对待我的儿子？”

Asuka met her eyes without flinching, but Shinji could feel her hand shaking a little in their handclasp below the level of the tabletop. "Shinji and I have been on our own for a long time, Dr. Ikari. We both have learned not to look for or want other people close to us. Our personal business is our own."  
明日香毫不退缩地迎上她的目光，但真嗣能感觉到她在桌下握手时手有些颤抖。“真嗣和我已经独自生活很久了，碇医生。我们都学会了不去寻求或渴望他人的亲近。我们的私事是我们自己的。”

"And it's my son and my daughter that are integral parts of it. Or are you going to claim that I have no involvement in my own family's affairs?"  
“而我的儿子和女儿是其中不可或缺的部分。还是说，你要声称我对自家事务没有参与权？”

_'So much for a politely worded 'Don't ask','_ Asuka thought. _'Fine. She wants to know?'_ "Then if you insist... I don't know."  
“看来客气的‘别问’是没用了，”明日香心想，“好吧，她想知道？”“那么如果你坚持……我不知道。”

"You don't _know_?" "你不知道吗？"

"Is _every_ _flurgen person_ I tell going to say that?" Asuka asked, irritated. "Yes! I don't know! We've known each other for years, and not known anything about each other at the same time! We've been apart for years, and constantly on each other's minds! I've straight said to him that I didn't love him a month ago. And yet this morning _I_ asked _him_ if he loved me, and he said yes, damn it! And I'm not sure of anything anymore, but if that blue-haired bi-..." Asuka stopped herself and cleared her throat. "If the First Child thinks she's going to declare that I don't deserve Shinji and _she'll_ take him away, she's got another thing coming. I don't know what Shinji and I are now, but it's _our_ right to find out on our own. Not hers, yours, or _anyone_ else's."  
"是不是每个我告诉的人都会这么说？" 明日香恼怒地问道，"是的！我不知道！我们认识多年，却对彼此一无所知！我们分开多年，却始终挂念着对方！一个月前我直接告诉他我不爱他。然而今天早上我问他是否爱我，他居然说是，该死！我现在什么都不确定了，但如果那个蓝头发的双……" 明日香顿住了，清了清嗓子，"如果那位第一少女认为我不配拥有真嗣，她想把他抢走，那她可就想错了。我不知道真嗣和我现在算什么，但这是我们自己发现的权利。不是她的，你的，或是任何其他人的。""

Yui sat back, eyes widened by the fierceness of Asuka's speech. "Well..." she said eventually, "You seem very sure about something you don't know, young lady."  
Yui 向后靠了靠，明日香激烈的言辞让她瞪大了眼睛。"嗯……"她最终说道，"你似乎对一个你不知道的事情非常确定，小姑娘。""

Asuka's grip on Shinji's hand was tight, but her poker face showed nothing. "You are a scientist, Doctor Ikari. Do you ever know the results of an experiment before you try it? You do the experiment even if you don't, _especially_ if you don't, because that's the only way to find out. I don't know what we are, but I do know I want to find out. No one's taking him from me. Until he and I are _both_ satisfied with the answer we find, no one else gets to butt in."  
明日香紧握着真嗣的手，但她的扑克脸毫无表情。“你是科学家，碇博士。你在尝试实验之前知道结果吗？即使你不知道，尤其是你不知道的时候，你还是会去做实验，因为那是唯一能找到答案的方法。我不知道我们是什么，但我知道我想弄清楚。没有人能把他从我身边带走。直到我和他都对找到的答案满意为止，没有人可以插手。”

Yui looked at her son. "Shinji?"  
唯看着她的儿子。“真嗣？”

Shinji was silent a long time. Asuka found her own heart pounding, trying to guess what he'd say, hanging on it as much as Yui was. "What you saw in Instrumentality... was not us at our best, mother. Both of us had been pushed to, and past, our breaking point back then. I desperately needed Asuka to give me some sign that I wasn't alone... and she was just as much afraid that I'd just hurt her because she believed that I was only turning to her out of my own need and I'd abandon her as soon as those needs were eased, that I'd hurt her because I was just using her, not because I wanted her. I don't want to hurt her at all, and I want to stay beside her always and help her. I told her I loved her because she asked me and I meant it, mother. I don't know where we go from this either, but I'm going with her, wherever it is." He looked his free hand, curled loosely on the table. "I nearly wiped out everything during Instrumentality when I thought that Asuka had rejected me. She was the only person who could have understood what I'd gone through, because she'd gone through so much of it too, sometimes with me... and if she couldn't accept me, who could? Why go on existing at all? ...But... I still wanted to try, to find happiness. I want to try with her, more than anyone else in the world. I can't remember when I've been happier since I told her this morning. And now she wants me to stay with her? That's more than I could have hoped for even just a little while ago. She doesn't know? 'Doubt is the origin of wisdom', Descartes said. I'm willing to trust her. You should too."  
真嗣沉默了许久。明日香感到自己的心跳加速，试图猜测他会说什么，就像唯一样紧张地等待着。“你在人类补完计划中看到的我们...并不是我们最好的一面，妈妈。那时我们都被逼到了，甚至超过了我们的极限。我迫切需要明日香给我一些迹象，让我知道我不是孤单一人...而她也同样害怕我会因为认为我只是出于自己的需要才转向她，一旦这些需求得到满足就会抛弃她，认为我只是利用她，而不是因为我想要她。我根本不想伤害她，我想永远陪在她身边，帮助她。我告诉她我爱她，是因为她问了我，而且我是真心的，妈妈。我不知道我们接下来会去哪里，但我会和她一起去，无论那是什么地方。”他看着自己空闲的手，松松地蜷在桌上。“在人类补完计划中，当我以为明日香拒绝了我时，我差点毁灭了一切。她是唯一能理解我所经历的人，因为她自己也经历了那么多，有时是和我一起...如果她都不能接受我，还有谁能呢？为什么还要继续存在？...但是.."“我仍然想尝试，去寻找幸福。我想和她一起尝试，胜过世界上任何其他人。自从今早告诉她以来，我记不清自己何时如此快乐过。而现在她希望我留在她身边？这比我在不久前所能希望的还要多。她不知道吗？‘怀疑是智慧的源泉’，笛卡尔曾说。我愿意相信她。你也应该如此。”"

Asuka stared at Shinji with as much surprise as Yui. _'Where the Hell did that come from, Shinji?'_ they unknowingly thought in concert.  
明日香盯着真嗣，惊讶程度不亚于绫波。‘真嗣，这到底是从哪儿冒出来的？’她们不约而同地想道。

Yui looked thoughtful for a long moment, then turned to Asuka again. "Be careful. Be true. And you'll know when you know. I did." She stood up. "I think I need to go talk to your father again, Shinji. I'll see you both tonight." With that, she walked back inside.  
Yui 沉思良久，然后再次转向 Asuka。“小心行事。保持真诚。当你真正明白时，你会知道的。我就是这样。”她站起身来。“我想我需要再去和你父亲谈谈，Shinji。今晚见。”说完，她走回了屋内。

_'Well, that was a little less nerve-wracking than I expected.'_ She looked at Shinji. _'And more revelatory...You really do always look at me. At just me.'_ She felt a tap on her shoulder. Daniel and Rayana had returned from the short walk away they'd retreated to when Yui had come out.  
“嗯，这比我想象的要少些紧张。”她看着 Shinji。“而且更让人领悟……你真的总是在看着我。只看着我。”她感到有人轻拍她的肩膀。Daniel 和 Rayana 已经从 Yui 出来时他们退开的那段短暂散步中回来了。

"Could I borrow you for a moment, Asuka?" he asked. "There are a couple things I'd like to talk to you about by yourself."  
“我能借用你一会儿吗，Asuka？”他问道。“有几件事我想单独和你谈谈。”

"And I've got a word or two for you, Shinji," Rayana said. "It should only take a few minutes."  
"我有些话要对你说，真嗣，" 绫波说道，"应该不会花太多时间。"

Asuka looked at Shinji, who shrugged. Asuka stood up and followed Daniel down the shore, leaving Rayana to sit down across from Shinji. They walked just a hundred meters down the beach and halted under a leaning palm tree.  
明日香看着真嗣，他耸了耸肩。明日香站起身，跟着丹尼尔沿着海岸走去，留下绫波坐在真嗣对面。他们沿着海滩走了大约一百米，在一棵倾斜的棕榈树下停了下来。

"We've thrown a lot at you in a very short period of time, Asuka, and you had an eventful morning. How are you feeling?" Daniel asked.  
"在这么短的时间内我们给了你很多信息，明日香，而且你今早经历了不少事。你现在感觉如何？" 丹尼尔问道。

She shook her head. "I really don't know. Better than I did a week ago, at least. It still feels unreal. My mother is alive. My friends too... and Shinji..." She didn't know how to even end that sentence.  
她摇了摇头。“我真的不知道。至少比一周前好些了。这一切还是感觉不真实。我妈妈还活着。我的朋友们也是……还有真嗣……”她不知道该如何结束这句话。

"Loves you. Never doubt that, Asuka. You may have honestly worried he was turning to you in the past merely as a last-resort source of comfort, but he really does care for you. You weren't his last resort, Asuka, you were his _foundation_. He reaches out to you because you're _you_, the one he cares about more than anyone else. It's even why he tried to strangle you on that beach."  
“他爱你。永远不要怀疑这一点，明日香。你可能真的担心过他过去只是把你当作最后的安慰来源，但他真的在乎你。你不是他的最后选择，明日香，你是他的基石。他向你伸出手，是因为你是你，是他最在乎的人。甚至在那个海滩上他试图掐死你，也是因为这个。”

Asuka gave him a funny look. "Odd way to show he cares."  
明日香给了他一个奇怪的表情。“奇怪的表达关心的方式。”

Daniel looked aside at her. "You of all people should know how deep it bites when the person you love most rejects you. You hurt him almost more than his mind could stand, there, and he wasn't in good mental shape to start with. But you can count on his love now, Asuka. He's told you. His heart is freed from the prison it was locked in for his whole life. You have it now. Take care of it."  
丹尼尔侧目看向她。“你是所有人中最清楚的，当你最爱的人拒绝你时，那种痛有多深。你在那里几乎让他心碎到无法承受，而他原本心理状态就不佳。但现在你可以依靠他的爱，明日香。他已经告诉你了。他的心从一生被囚禁的牢笼中解放出来了。现在它是你的了。好好珍惜它。”

"And I'm already getting 'the talk' from his mother. Like he's my boyfriend or something." She gave a weak laugh.  
“而且他妈妈已经开始给我‘那番谈话’了。好像他是我的男朋友似的。”她虚弱地笑了笑。

Daniel gave a stronger one. "If you want to see his face light up, just call him that where he can hear it. To him or to others, it won't matter. Just watch, he'll practically glow, I bet."  
丹尼尔笑得更强烈了。“如果你想看到他脸上发光，只要在他能听到的地方那样称呼他。无论是对他还是对别人，都没关系。等着看吧，我打赌他会几乎发光，我敢说。”

"He may have a heart attack at the sudden switch from 'Baka-Shinji', or the thousand other horrible things I've called him before."  
"他可能会因为从‘笨蛋真嗣’突然转变，或是我之前叫他的那一千种糟糕称呼而心脏病发作。"

"Yes, you've hurt him in the past. And he still comes back. He always will. He could no more stop loving you than he could give up breathing. And now you have the power to make him feel even better than the worst of the bad you ever hit him with."  
"是的，你过去伤害过他。但他依然回来。他永远都会。他不可能停止爱你，就像他不能停止呼吸一样。而现在，你有能力让他感受到比以往任何一次伤害都更深的快乐。"

"I... want to. Why do I want to?" Asuka looked at him in confusion. "I'm still so angry with him for what he did and didn't do back then, but still…I've never wanted to make someone else feel better like this before, to make someone else happy. Not since... Mama."  
"我...想这么做。为什么我想这么做？" 明日香困惑地看着他。"我仍然对他当时所做和未做的事情感到愤怒，但尽管如此…我从未像这样想要让别人感觉更好，让别人快乐。自从...妈妈之后。"

"Why do you think your mother would hold you? It's hardly unusual to want to make those you care for feel happier. He didn't say to you 'I want to help you somehow and be with you forever' just to seek comfort for himself. He said it because he cared for you and wanted to make you feel better."  
为什么你认为你母亲会抱你？想让你关心的人感到更快乐，这并不罕见。他对你说‘我想以某种方式帮助你，永远陪伴你’，并不是为了寻求自己的安慰。他说这话是因为他关心你，想让你感觉更好。

Asuka looked at the sand for a few steps. "That's... another thing that's hard to deal with. I keep feeling like it's too good to be true, like I can't deserve something that feels that good so easily. Or it's some kind of trick. Or I get worried that he's in love with the mask I always tried to project and not the real me."  
绫波看着沙地走了几步。“那……是另一件难以处理的事。我总觉得这好得不像真的，好像我不配轻易得到这么美好的东西。或者这是一种诡计。或者我担心他爱的是我一直试图展现的面具，而不是真正的我。

Daniel shook his head. "Who, the brave, vibrant, indomitable genius he knew? He knows the real you more than anyone else. Or at least can feel the things he doesn't fully understand are in there. He knows you have pains inside you try to hide from everyone. He wants to help you, to take away those pains, or at least bear them together. Don't worry about what 'Asuka' he's in love with. The answer is still 'yes'. You can make yourself into that mask. Free will is the ne plus ultra in my realm. You can be who you want to be. And you have amazing will, Asuka. Just defeat your doubts and remember who you are; the girl who even death can't stop. I didn't choose the motto for your ship idly. The past defines you but does not determine you. Put it aside and _decide_ who you are. Act as you would want to be. Or to put it a more vernacular way; fake it 'til you make it."  
丹尼尔摇了摇头。“谁，那个勇敢、充满活力、不屈不挠的天才他认识？他比任何人都更了解真正的你。或者至少能感受到那些他不完全理解的东西。他知道你内心有痛苦，你试图向所有人隐藏。他想帮助你，消除那些痛苦，或者至少一起承担。别担心他爱上的‘明日香’是谁。答案仍然是‘是的’。你可以把自己变成那个面具。在我的领域里，自由意志是至高无上的。你可以成为你想成为的人。你有着惊人的意志，明日香。只要战胜你的疑虑，记住你是谁；那个连死亡都无法阻止的女孩。我并不是随意选择你船上的座右铭。过去定义了你，但并不决定你。把它抛开，决定你是谁。按照你想成为的样子行事。或者用更通俗的话说；假装直到你成功。”

Asuka's mouth twisted in a wry smile. "Right. I've got the 'unlovable neurotic bitch' thing down, now I just need to wish myself into being the 'hot ace pilot' again and I'm set."  
明日香嘴角扭曲，露出一丝苦笑。“对。我已经掌握了‘不可爱的神经质婊子’这个角色，现在我只需要希望自己再次成为‘炙手可热的天才飞行员’，我就搞定了。”

"Don't forget 'dashing commander' and 'passionate lover' while you're at it," Daniel added with a smile. "Whatever you want to be. We will help you make it happen. My soldiers will be under your and Shinji's direction starting tomorrow. Knowing you two, most of the initiative will be from you, but Shinji's there to balance you. Trust in him. He'll back you in anything. If he has a bad feeling about something, don't just dismiss it."  
"别忘了还有'英勇的指挥官'和'热情的恋人'，" 丹尼尔笑着补充道。"无论你想成为什么，我们都会帮你实现。从明天起，我的士兵们将由你和真嗣指挥。有你们俩在，大部分决策会来自你，但真嗣会平衡你的决定。信任他，他会在任何事情上支持你。如果他对某事有不好的预感，不要轻易忽视。"

"Why are you talking like you're not going to be there?"  
"为什么你说话的语气好像你不会在场一样？"

"I'll be in and out. No fear, you're never alone. You'll have solid troops with you, and your friends beside you. You'll have a co-Pilot that loves and trusts you, a more powerful war machine than anything else on the planet, and us at your back. A force that marches under the banner of Avalon is invincible. But that's for tomorrow. Tonight, we eat, drink, and be merry."  
"我会进进出出。别担心，你永远不会孤单。你会有可靠的士兵陪伴，还有朋友在你身边。你会有一个深爱你并信任你的副驾驶员，一台比地球上任何其他战争机器都强大的战甲，还有我们在你背后。一支在阿瓦隆旗帜下行进的队伍是无敌的。但那是明天的事。今晚，我们吃喝玩乐，尽情享受。"

Asuka snorted. "That doesn't sound like the most optimistic way to phrase that."  
明日香哼了一声。“这听起来可不像是最乐观的说法。”

"We die, we die. We live, we live. Live every day like it was the last, and you will have few regrets. And death works for me, remember? No one dies around here without my permission. But that's not what you need to worry about tonight. The 791st Division Ball is going to be something you've never had to face before; a formal dance where you two are the center of attention."  
“我们死，我们死。我们活，我们活。把每一天都当作最后一天来过，遗憾就会少些。而且死亡为我所用，记得吗？这里没人能在未经我允许的情况下死去。但今晚你不需要担心这个。第 791 师团舞会将会是你从未面对过的场合；一个正式舞会，而你们两位将是焦点。”

"Great, nothing to worry about. I'm sure the Third is a fabulous dancer," Asuka said sarcastically.  
"“太好了，没什么可担心的。我敢肯定第三是个出色的舞者，”明日香讽刺地说。”

"He might surprise you. He has before, after all. No one will begrudge you the dancing, no matter how it goes. But I mean your commissionings. Normally, to be commissioned as Imperial Army officers, that includes swearing an oath of service to myself and the Crown. I'm not going to require that of you, Shinji, or your friends. I've just handed these commissions to you out of the blue, so I can't in good conscience compel you to swear to receive them. I won't say no if you do want to, though. It will win the approval of the unit, for sure. My personal trust in you will more than satisfy the legal end of things, either way. It's up to you."  
"他可能会让你惊讶。毕竟，他以前也这样做过。无论舞会进展如何，没有人会责怪你跳舞。但我说的是你的委任。通常，被任命为帝国军队军官，这包括向我本人和皇冠宣誓效忠。我不会要求你或你的朋友们这样做。我刚刚突然把这些委任交给你，所以我不能良心上强迫你宣誓接受它们。不过，如果你想宣誓，我不会拒绝。这肯定会赢得部队的认可。无论哪种方式，我个人对你的信任将完全满足法律上的要求。这取决于你。"

"Are these permanent oaths, or for a specific term?"  
"这些誓言是永久的，还是特定期限的？"

"Indefinite, usually, but we can set a term if you like." He raised an eyebrow. "Six months, perhaps?"  
"通常是无限期的，但如果你愿意，我们可以设定一个期限。" 他挑了挑眉。"或许六个月？"

Asuka thought it over for a moment, then laughed. "Ha! Sounds right. But you're just going to loan me an army on my word as bond? I met you not even three days ago."  
明日香思索片刻，随即笑出声来。“哈！听起来没错。但你真的会仅凭我一句话就借给我一支军队吗？我们见面还不到三天呢。”

"You may have met me about three Earth-days ago, but I've known Asuka Langley Sohryu for cenmills. I trust you. And I trust beyond reason to get results beyond hope. A wise lady told me that once."  
“你可能是在地球上三天前才认识我，但我对惣流·明日香·兰格雷已经了解很久了。我相信你。而且我信任你，超越理智，只为得到超越希望的结果。一位智者曾这样告诉我。”

"Trust... I've had little reason for trust and hope in my world." Asuka sounded more depressed than bitter, for a change. "That's a big part of why all this seems so unreal, I think. This much good news just never happens to me, not without a huge catch." _'I get named an Eva Pilot, and find my mother's body. I defeat the entire Mass Production series in less than four minutes, then they get right back up anyway. I survive the end of the world, then I go through Hell for the next four years.'_  
“信任……在我的世界里，信任和希望的理由少之又少。”明日香这次听起来比以往更加沮丧而非怨恨。“我想，这也是为什么这一切显得如此不真实的原因之一。这么多好消息从未在我身上发生过，除非伴随着巨大的代价。”‘我被任命为 EVA 驾驶员，却发现母亲的遗体。我在不到四分钟内击败了整个量产系列，然后它们又重新站了起来。我幸存于世界的终结，接下来的四年却如同经历了地狱。’

"Trust Shinji. Trust your friends. Trust yourself."  
"相信真嗣。相信你的朋友。相信你自己。"

Asuka tilted her head. "Not going to put yourself on that list?"  
明日香歪了歪头。"不把自己也加到那个名单上吗？"

Daniel shrugged. "That's up to you. I'm not the kind of man or god who's going to _make_ you trust me. That's what the other side does."  
丹尼尔耸了耸肩。"那取决于你。我不是那种会强迫你信任我的人或神。那是另一边的人的做法。"

"The other side?" “另一边？”

Daniel waved it aside. "I'll tell you after you come back from rebuilding your world if you want. It's too much to go into now, and it's just depressing. Tonight is your last chance for a party before a long mission, so have fun. It'll be the prom you and Shinji never got to have, if you like."  
丹尼尔挥手将其搁置一旁。“如果你愿意，等你从重建世界回来后我会告诉你。现在谈这个太复杂了，而且只会让人沮丧。今晚是你执行长期任务前的最后一次派对，所以尽情享受吧。如果你愿意，这将是你们和真嗣从未有过的毕业舞会。”

Asuka looked somewhat dubious. "...you want me to take Shinji to the prom? When did I walk into a high school drama show?" _'And no, that idea did not just scare me. It did not. Shut up.'_  
"明日香看起来有些怀疑。“……你想让我带真嗣去参加舞会？我什么时候走进了一部高中校园剧？”‘而且不，这个主意并没有吓到我。真的没有。闭嘴。’”

Daniel smiled. "Look at it this way, it's a chance to wear a fancier dress than you've probably ever gotten a real excuse for, take out for public viewing a boy who's declared he loves you, and melt his brain with your outfit, looks, and moves, all in front of a huge crowd."  
丹尼尔笑了。“这么想吧，这是一个机会，穿上比你以往任何真实场合都更华丽的礼服，带着一个公开宣称爱你的男孩亮相，用你的装扮、外表和舞步让他神魂颠倒，而且这一切都在一大群人面前。”

"Ok, that sounds more like it."  
“好吧，听起来更像那么回事了。”

"Oh, one last thing I wanted to show you, might come in handy if a close fight comes up in your mission..."  
“哦，还有最后一样东西我想给你看看，如果你的任务中遇到近身搏斗的话可能会派上用场……”

### Chapter 20 Philosophy & Understanding Women... 

Oh, Who Are You Kidding?

哲学与理解女性……哦，你在开谁的玩笑？

The Empress just looked at Shinji for a moment, head tilted to one side. "A philosopher, hmm?" she said eventually. "Did you cover more than just the nature of mind and consciousness, or was that your sole focus? I can see the interest in that field, given the strangeness of Instrumentality."

皇后只是看了真嗣一会儿，头微微一侧。“哲学家，嗯？”她最终说道，“你探讨的不仅仅是心智与意识的本质，还是说那是你唯一的焦点？考虑到人类补完计划的奇异性，我能理解你对这一领域的兴趣。”

"Um, that was where I put most of my studies, yes." Shinji was glad for the decidedly academic topic. Today's combined several hours of intense 'talking' with Asuka after years of miserable, celibate isolation had his hormones on fire, and keeping his mind on philosophy would help keep his mind off the Empress's extravagant... features. Mostly. "Um, we did get into a survey of the major classic schools, but mostly on the nature of consciousness and the soul."

"嗯，那是我大部分学习的地方，是的。" 真嗣很庆幸话题转向了学术性。今天与明日香多年悲惨的独身隔离后连续数小时的激烈"交谈"让他的荷尔蒙沸腾，而将思绪集中在哲学上能帮助他不去想女皇那奢华的……特质。多半如此。"嗯，我们确实涉及了主要古典学派的概览，但主要还是探讨意识与灵魂的本质。"

"Did you ever get into Nietzsche? And I'm up here, Shinji."

你曾深入了解过尼采吗？而我，在这里，真嗣。

He jerked his eyes back up. 'I wasn't! Um... crap, are her breasts magnetic? This is as bad as Misato and her shower towels & short-shorts!' "Um! I mean, some, not very much. Just a survey of his work, the outlines, really, and a few key quotes."

他猛地抬起视线，'我没有！呃...糟糕，她的胸部是磁性的吗？这简直和美里洗澡时的浴巾和超短裤一样糟糕！' "呃！我是说，不多，真的不多。只是对他的作品做了个概览，大概的框架，还有几句关键的引述。"

"A pity. He was quite mad from syphilis by the end, but interesting work before that. A quote you might want to bear in mind: "Whom hateth woman most?-Thus spake the iron to the loadstone: "I hate thee most, because thou attractest, but art too weak to draw unto thee."" A part of why you used to drive Asuka so mad back in the Angel War was that you attracted her, but you'd never push back at her. That's why she'd push at you so much. She really wanted you to push back, to react, to look at her. If you're going to love her, Shinji, don't half-ass it. Don't make her feel like you're just using her to make yourself feel better. Make her feel like she's the world to you. It will come back the same way."

可惜了。他到后来因梅毒而变得相当疯狂，但之前的工作颇有意思。这里有句话你或许该铭记于心：“谁最恨女人？——铁对磁石如是说：‘我最恨你，因为你吸引我，却无力将我拉近。’”你在天使战争时期之所以让明日香那么抓狂，部分原因是你吸引了她，却从不对她有所抗拒。正因为如此，她才会不断向你施压。她真心希望你能反击，能有所反应，能关注她。如果你要爱她，真嗣，就别半途而废。别让她觉得你只是在利用她来让自己感觉好些。要让她感受到，她对你而言就是整个世界。这样，她也会以同样的方式回应你。

Shinji felt his mental tires screech at the sudden conversational swerve. "I..."

真嗣感到自己的思维仿佛轮胎在急转弯时发出尖锐的摩擦声。“我……”

"You know why she was so mad at you during Instrumentality about that little incident in her hospital room?"

"你知道她在统一过程中为什么对你那么生气吗？就是因为她病房里那件小事。"

Shinji grimaced and looked down at the table. My, the wood grain was fascinating. He sighed. That little incident had been one of his lowest moments, in every sense. And Instrumentality had shown it to all of mankind; his classmates, strangers, and worst of all, Asuka. Rayana waited him out. "Because I was just using her to make myself feel better?" he hazarded.

真嗣皱着眉头，低头凝视着桌面。哎呀，这木纹真是迷人。他叹了口气。那次小插曲无论从哪个角度看，都是他人生中的最低谷。而人类补完计划竟将这一切公之于众；他的同学、陌生人，最糟糕的是，还有明日香。蕾雅娜耐心地等待着他的回应。“因为我只是利用她来让自己感觉好一点？”他试探性地问道。

"That, the whole 'consent' thing, ...and that you never asked her..."

关于那个，就是“同意”的问题，……还有你从未问过她……

Shinji winced again. 真嗣再次皱起了眉头。

"...if she wanted to join in."

"...如果她想加入的话。"

Shinji jerked his head back up and gave her a very confused and disbelieving look.

真嗣猛地抬起头，用一种极其困惑和不信任的眼神看着她。

"I believe my husband has mentioned the various times she a little-too-subtly tried to get you to come to her? I already mentioned she was attracted to you. And then you just whip it out and jerk off over her without so much as a 'by-your-leave'? Shinji, she felt not just rejected but insulted. To her eyes, you deliberately ignored her every tease, hint, and offer, and then when you had the chance, you brought out the idea of sexual pleasure that used her in a way that seemed to pointedly exclude her having any part in it! It certainly seemed to justify her feeling that you were always just using her for your own neediness, and never would care for her. You lived with her for months on end, she ran around wearing nothing but a towel sometimes, and your other roommate was Misato, but you never so much as made a pass at her? You barely even looked at her, no matter what she wore. And then you use her like a blow-up doll to get yourself off? Of course she was hurt!"

我相信我丈夫已经多次提到过，她曾过于含蓄地试图让你接近她。我之前也说过，她对你有好感。然后你就这么直接掏出来，在她面前自慰，连一句“打扰了”都没有？真嗣，她不仅感到被拒绝，还受到了侮辱。在她看来，你故意忽视了她每一次的挑逗、暗示和邀请，而当你有机会时，你却提出了一个利用她的性快感方式，这种方式似乎刻意排除了她参与其中的可能！这无疑让她觉得你一直只是在利用她满足自己的需求，永远不会真正关心她。你和她同住数月，有时她只围着一条毛巾四处走动，而你的另一个室友是美里，但你从未对她有过任何表示？无论她穿什么，你几乎都不曾正眼看过她。然后你却把她当作充气娃娃来满足自己？她当然会受伤！

"But... but... but... s-she always was yelling at me for even trying to look at her!" Shinji protested. "'Baka-Shinji, the total hentai'!"

但...但...但她总是因为我试图看她一眼就对我大吼大叫！" 真嗣抗议道。"'笨蛋真嗣，十足的变态'！"

"News flash, Shinji; Women do not always say out loud what you're supposed to hear. In fact, sometimes quite the opposite. Sometimes what they say is just so they can claim to have said it, and what they mean they won't say out loud."

快讯，真嗣；女人并不总是大声说出你应该听的话。事实上，有时恰恰相反。有时候她们说的话只是为了表明她们已经说过，而她们真正想表达的，却不会大声说出来。

Shinji stared at her for a minute, then sank his head into his hands. "Women are crazy. I'm dead. What am I supposed to do, develop super-psychic powers so I know what the Hell she means?"

真嗣盯着她看了一分钟，然后双手抱头。“女人真是疯了。我完蛋了。我该怎么办，难道要开发出超心理能力才能明白她到底是什么意思吗？”

"Mmm, that's one solution, but I think this time we're going to go with 'you get some advice from a very thoroughly female fertility goddess, and keep doing what you've been doing lately' for your case," Rayana said amusedly. "Keep being forthright and honest with Asuka, and listen with more than just your ears. Remember what Ayanami-san asked you in the middle of all that strangeness? 'Did you try to understand, Ikari?'"

"嗯，那是一个办法，但这次我想我们会选择‘你从一位非常彻底的女性生育女神那里得到一些建议，并继续做你最近在做的事’来处理你的情况，"雷亚娜打趣地说道。"继续对明日香坦率真诚，倾听时不仅要用心听。记得在所有那些奇怪的事情中，绫波丽问过你什么吗？‘你尝试去理解了吗，碇？’"

Shinji's head came up from his hands, but he gave her a less than happy look. "Yes, I did. And if you know that, you know what came from that."

真嗣从双手中抬起头，但他的眼神并不愉快。“是的，我做了。既然你知道这个，那你应该也知道由此带来的后果。”

"And your protest was that Asuka never told you anything, and that made it impossible to understand."

你的抗议是明日香从未向你透露任何信息，这使得理解变得不可能。

"It did! How am I supposed to know anything if she doesn't mean what she says, and doesn't say what she means?!" Shinji complained.

“真的！如果她说的不是她想的，想的又不说出来，我怎么可能知道呢？！” 真嗣抱怨道。

"As I said, listen with more than just your ears. Pay attention to how she says something, not just what. Watch her body language, think about why she says or does things, and notice what she doesn't talk about. For example; when she says 'I don't want to talk about it' for a given topic, what does that say to you?"

正如我所说，倾听不仅仅是用耳朵。要注意她是如何表达的，而不仅仅是内容。观察她的肢体语言，思考她为何这么说或这么做，并留意她避而不谈的话题。例如，当她对某个话题说“我不想谈论这个”时，这对你传达了什么信息？

"Um, 'I don't want to talk about it'?"

"呃，'我不想谈论这个'？"

The Empress winced and put her hand against her face. "You are such a male, Shinji. No, that does not mean strictly what the words say. It more commonly means 'this is a very sensitive and important topic to me, so if you are going to ask about it, be careful and honest when you do, but preferably not just right now, as I am emotionally tense from even thinking about it'."

皇后皱眉，手抚面颊。“真是个男人啊，真嗣。不，这并非字面之意。更常见的是指‘此事对我极为敏感且重要，若你欲探询，务必谨慎诚实，但最好不是现在，因我仅是思及便已情绪紧张’。”

Shinji blinked at her. "...And I'm supposed to figure that all out from 'I don't want to talk about it'?"

真嗣眨了眨眼看着她。“……就凭一句‘我不想谈这个’，我就得全猜出来？”

"Welcome to dealing with the women in your life, Shinji. Pay attention, there will be a test later. We call it 'Real Life'," the Empress said slightly sarcastically. "Don't feel too bad. There are rewards and benefits to persevering and paying close attention. Such as unbounded love, limitless happiness, and most powerfully, absolute trust."

欢迎来到与生活中的女性打交道的世界，真嗣。注意听好了，稍后会有测试，我们称之为“现实生活”，”女皇略带讽刺地说道，“别太沮丧，坚持并细心观察会有回报的，比如无边的爱、无尽的幸福，以及最强大的——绝对信任。”

"Trust," Shinji echoed woodenly. "My trust has been abused before, and I've just gotten hurt. About the only person I trust at all now is Asuka." He sighed again. "I guess that's a good thing, right?"

"信任，" 真嗣木然地重复道，"我的信任曾被辜负，只换来伤害。如今，我唯一能信任的人，恐怕只有明日香了。" 他再次叹息，"或许，这也是件好事吧？"

"The best, Shinji. Light years beyond simple attraction, warm fuzzy feelings of being cared for, and all the other pieces, by far the most important and powerful part of 'love' is trust," Rayana said with utter conviction. "You know something of how powerful it can be. Do you think you and Asuka would fight with such close and smooth synchronization without it? The trust of a battle-friend is different from that for a lover, but not so far as all that. And when you are so lucky as to have both, as it sounds you might be feeling your way towards, you have the best of both worlds. You should look up the Sacred Band of Thebes sometime, for example. You trust Asuka and I think she trusts you. Hold on to that, and much will grow from it." She waved down the beach where Shinji could see Daniel and Asuka talking. "If Daniel were to come running back here screaming and swinging a sword at my head, I wouldn't even think, I'd know he had a good reason for it. I trust him enough to never worry about him intentionally harming me without very good reason."

"最棒的，真嗣。超越简单的吸引、被关怀的温暖模糊感觉，以及所有其他部分，到目前为止，'爱'中最重要和最强大的部分是信任，"雷亚娜坚定地说道。"你多少知道它有多强大。你认为你和明日香能如此紧密和顺畅地同步战斗，没有它吗？战斗伙伴的信任与恋人的信任不同，但并非完全不同。而当你如此幸运地同时拥有两者，听起来你似乎正摸索着走向这种感觉，你就拥有了两个世界的最佳。你应该找个时间了解一下底比斯的神圣军团。你信任明日香，我想她也信任你。抓住这一点，许多美好将由此生长。"她向海滩那边挥手，真嗣可以看到丹尼尔和明日香正在交谈。"如果丹尼尔跑回来尖叫着挥剑砍向我，我甚至不会思考，我会知道他有充分的理由。我信任他到从不担心他会无缘无故故意伤害我。"

"If Asuka came running back here screaming and waving a sword at me, I think that would just count as 'Thursday' for me," Shinji said. "It seems like the best I could do, some days."

"如果明日香跑回来对我尖叫并挥舞着剑，我想那对我来说不过是'周四'的日常罢了，" 真嗣说，"有些日子，这似乎是我能做的最好的事了。"

"Maybe in the past, but what about the last couple of days? Specifically, today? Anger doesn't seem to have been Asuka's emotion of the day. Something much nicer instead, really. Things change in life, Shinji. Just listen with more than your ears, pay attention to more than just what is said out loud," Rayana gave him a sly smile. "And the next time you think about bringing out 'Little Shinji', you might want to make sure Asuka is involved. A girl likes to feel that her boy appreciates her beauty, you know." She laughed. "You had better be ready the next time 'washing her back' comes up, in case she says 'yes, now get to it!'."

或许在过去是这样，但最近几天呢？特别是今天？愤怒似乎并非明日香的主导情绪。反而是更美好的情感，真的。生活中的事物是会变的，真嗣。用心聆听，不仅仅是用耳朵，留意那些未曾大声说出口的。"蕾雅娜狡黠地笑了笑，"下次你若想让'小真嗣'亮相，最好确保明日香也在场。女孩子喜欢感受到她的男孩欣赏她的美，你懂的。"她笑了起来，"下次提到'帮她洗背'时，你最好做好准备，万一她说'好啊，现在就来吧！'"

Shinji squirmed. "I'll... I'll try. It's... scary. We've... not had the best of luck on that front."

真嗣扭动着身体。“我……我会试试的。这……很可怕。我们……在那方面运气一直不太好。”

Rayana's voice was gentle. "I know. That's why I wanted to talk to you about trust and sex, Shinji. Nearly everything about sex has been up until now badly tainted and desecrated for Asuka, so much so that even when it was you, she couldn't stand someone touching her. But things have changed, both from our help, and your words. So the next time, it won't be something she is forced to do with someone she hates or fears. Next time, it will be with someone she knows loves her and that she wants to have touch her."

绫波的声音温柔而细腻：“我明白。这就是我想和你谈谈信任与性爱问题的原因，真嗣。几乎所有关于性的事情，对明日香来说，至今都受到了严重的玷污和亵渎，以至于即使是你在触碰她，她也难以忍受。但情况已经发生了变化，既有我们的帮助，也有你的话语影响。所以下一次，她不会再被迫与她憎恨或恐惧的人发生关系。下一次，将会是与一个她知道深爱着她、并且她愿意让其触碰自己的人。”

'Right. It will only be something I've dreamed about for years with the girl I've been in love with since the day we met after I've failed her in every way possible and ended the world. A girl who has had sex hundreds of times, all of them practically rape, except how they didn't exactly happen. And I've never had sex with anyone or anything but Mrs. Rosie Palms. No pressure. What could go wrong?'

没错。这不过是我多年来梦寐以求的与那个女孩的邂逅，自从我们相遇的那天起我就爱上了她，尽管我在各个方面都辜负了她，甚至毁灭了世界。这个女孩经历了数百次性关系，几乎每一次都近乎强奸，只不过这些并未真正发生。而我，除了与自己的右手罗茜·帕尔姆斯夫人有过亲密接触外，从未与任何人或物有过性经历。毫无压力。还能出什么岔子呢？

'...I am so dead.' 我死定了。

Rayana dipped her head to catch his lowered eyes. "Hey, none of that! I know that look. You're already convinced you'll fail, or it will be a disaster, or you'll make her cry again, aren't you?"

蕾安娜低下头，捕捉到他垂下的目光。“嘿，别这样！我知道那种眼神。你已经认定自己会失败，或者会搞砸，或者又会让她哭泣，对吧？”

Shinji sadly nodded. 真嗣悲伤地点了点头。

Rayana blew a raspberry at him. "Will not. Things are different than they were before. Did she have any objections to what you two have been doing so far, or did she seem rather pleased?"

蕾安娜朝他吹了个嘲讽的口哨。“不会的。现在的情况和以前不同了。她对你们俩到目前为止所做的事情有没有反对意见，还是她似乎挺满意的？”

Shinji felt his face starting to redden. "Ah, I think she liked it." 'I sure did. I think that was the most fun I've ever had, and I am really looking forward to more of it.'

真嗣感到自己的脸开始发红。“啊，我觉得她很喜欢。”我确实很喜欢。我认为那是我有过的最愉快的经历，我真的很期待能有更多这样的时光。

"And did she ever say 'Stop! I am tired of this and you're doing it wrong!', hmm?"

她可曾说过“停下！我厌倦了，你这么做不对！”，嗯？

"Um, no." 呃，不。

"If we hadn't called you two for that meeting, do you think you'd still be there right now, going at it full speed?"

如果我们没有叫你们俩来参加那个会议，你们觉得现在还会在那里全力以赴地干吗？

'Please?' he thought hopefully. "Um... maybe?"

'请？' 他满怀希望地想。"呃... 也许？"

Rayana rolled her eyes. "One more thing, Shinji. Confidence is sexy. No more 'maybe'. Next time Asuka suggests, hints, asks for, or knowing her, demands your attentions of this nature, are you going to say 'um, maybe?'"

绫波翻了个白眼。“还有一件事，真嗣。自信很迷人。别再说‘也许’了。下次明日香提议、暗示、请求，或者以她的性格，直接要求你给予这种关注时，你难道还要说‘呃，也许吗？’”

"Um, may-.." Shinji stopped himself before his reflexive answer could sound any more foolish. "No. I mean yes. I mean..." He took a steadying breath. "I'm going to do whatever makes her happy."

"呃，可...” 真嗣在脱口而出更愚蠢的回答前止住了自己。“不，我是说，是的。我是说...” 他深吸一口气，稳住情绪，“我会做任何让她开心的事。”

"Good boy. You're going to give her a firm and definite 'yes!' Remember, girls have a sex drive too. Asuka's going to have some strong wants and desires. When that girl puts her mind to something, she pushes hard. So be ready. If and when Asuka decides she wants more from you than a kiss, it's probably going to be pretty intense. Don't panic, don't freeze, and trust her. You think kissing is fun? Sex with someone you love is going to melt your brain. Enjoy yourself, make sure she's enjoying herself, and you'll be fine, I promise." Rayana's smile turned impish. "Just start gentle and stay gentle until she says 'harder!' If you need, I have some helpful pamphlets. Here, let me show you some..."

好孩子，你要坚定明确地回答她“是！”记住，女孩也有性欲。明日香会有强烈的渴望和欲望。一旦她下定决心，就会全力以赴。所以要做好准备。如果明日香决定她想要的不仅仅是你的吻，那可能会非常激烈。不要慌张，不要僵住，要信任她。你认为接吻有趣吗？与你所爱的人做爱会令你神魂颠倒。享受吧，确保她也享受，我保证你会没事的。雷亚娜的笑容变得淘气起来。“只需从温柔开始，并保持温柔，直到她说‘用力！’如果需要，我这里有些有用的宣传册。来，我给你看看……”

Shinji's eyes got wider and wider as Rayana brought out some alarmingly colorful and detailed pamphlets. His brain just flatly refused to process half of what his ears rapidly tried to forget they'd heard before terminal embarrassment set in.

当雷亚娜拿出一些色彩鲜艳、细节详尽得令人吃惊的小册子时，真嗣的眼睛越睁越大。他的大脑干脆拒绝处理耳朵迅速试图忘记的一半内容，以免陷入无法挽回的尴尬之中。

"...then run your fingers up her..." "...it'll stretch, don't worry..." "...never too slippery..." "...whatever you do, don't sneeze at this point..." "...if this gives you the hiccups, that's normal..." "...until you both pass out. Any questions, Shinji?"

"...然后手指沿着她向上滑动..." "...会有些拉伸，别担心..." "...永远不会太滑腻..." "...无论做什么，此时千万别打喷嚏..." "...如果这让你打嗝，那是正常的..." "...直到你们俩都昏过去。还有问题吗，真嗣？"

Shinji felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into crystal blue eyes. "Hey, Thir-... Shinji. We're done. How about you?" Asuka glanced at the bewildering array of papers on the table. "What have you been talking about?"

真嗣感到一只手搭在肩上，抬头望进一双晶莹的蓝眼睛。“嘿，三……真嗣。我们结束了。你呢？”明日香瞥了一眼桌上令人眼花缭乱的文件。“你们在讨论什么？”

"I... she..." Shinji gave up in total confusion about how to say anything about their topic of discussion without sounding perverted, nuts, or both. "Um... philosophy, listening, and trust. And s-stuff."

"我... 她..." 真嗣在如何不显得猥琐、疯狂或两者兼而有之的情况下谈论他们的话题上完全陷入了混乱。"嗯... 哲学，倾听，还有信任。以及... 诸如此类的东西。"

Asuka's eyes narrowed a bit. "So why do you look like you just got caught sneaking out of the girl's locker room? Not that you'd ever have the guts to try something like that." She didn't sound very angry or suspicious, just a little wary of the fact his perfectly innocent answer was paired with stuttering and fire-engine-red blushing.

明日香的眼睛微微眯起。“那你为什么看起来像是刚被抓到从女生更衣室溜出来似的？当然，你也没那个胆子去尝试那种事。”她的语气并不怎么生气或怀疑，只是对他那看似无辜的回答伴随着结巴和火警红般的脸红感到有些警觉。

"We discussed the things he listed, and how that all relates to sex, young lady. And poor innocent Shinji was just a tad bit embarrassed and overwhelmed by my helpful pamphlets and slightly silly advice. I told you not to panic, Shinji. Most of the things I just said were in fun," Rayana commented. She glanced at Shinji, one eyebrow raised. "You do realize I was messing with you about the trampoline, I hope? You were so cute and innocent, I just wanted to see how far I could go before you caught on that I was playing with you," Rayana said with a broad smile. "You've got a true innocent here, Asuka. Careful breaking him in. Hmm, would you like some of my helpful pamphlets?"

我们讨论了他列出的那些事，以及它们与性的关联，小姑娘。而可怜无辜的真嗣，只是略微感到尴尬和不知所措，面对我那些助人为乐的小册子和略带戏谑的建议。我告诉过你不要慌张，真嗣。我刚才说的多数都是玩笑话。”雷亚娜评论道。她瞥了一眼真嗣，眉毛微挑。“希望你意识到我关于蹦床的那番话是在逗你玩，你那么可爱又天真，我只是想看看在你察觉到我在逗你之前，我能做到什么程度。”雷亚娜带着宽厚的笑容说。“你这儿可真有个纯真无邪的家伙，明日香。小心点儿，别把他带坏了。嗯，要不要来点我的实用小册子？”

Shinji frantically shook his head. Asuka looked a little more closely at the ones spread out on the table. "Wait, there are way too many legs in that picture..."

真嗣疯狂地摇头。明日香更仔细地看了看桌上摊开的那些图片。“等等，那张图里的腿太多了……”

"Just the right number for three people," Rayana corrected.

"正好适合三个人。" 雷亚娜纠正道。

"...Three?" Asuka sounded astonished, from disgust or interest Shinji couldn't tell.

"...三个？"明日香听起来很惊讶，是厌恶还是兴趣，真嗣分辨不出。

"I wanted to be prepared for any questions you might have. After all, there was that one worldline where you, Shinji, and Rei-chan were in a very enthusiastic threesome," Rayana said cheerfully. "You spent most nights together playing 'who can wear out Shinji first?' Shinji never got much sleep, but never seemed to complain."

我想为你们可能提出的任何问题做好准备。毕竟，在那个世界线里，你、真嗣和零酱可是热情洋溢的三人组，”蕾雅娜愉快地说道，“你们大多数夜晚都在一起玩‘谁能先让真嗣筋疲力尽’的游戏。真嗣虽然没怎么睡过好觉，但似乎从未抱怨过。”

Asuka's expression now matched Shinji's of a few minutes prior. "Sex with... Wondergirl?! But... the fuck... I've never... she's his sister!"

明日香的表情此刻与几分钟前真嗣的如出一辙。“和……奇迹女孩做爱？！但……这他妈的……我从没……她是他妹妹啊！”

"The protection of ignorance; none of you knew. No one ever bothered to tell Rei-chan about her heritage. And she only shares twenty-five percent of Shinji's genome anyhow. You'd be surprised how little being related slows down the 'shippers sometimes... in any case, it had positive effects."

无知的保护；你们无人知晓。从未有人费心向绫波玲透露她的血统。况且，她与真嗣的基因也只有四分之一的相似度。你可能会惊讶，血缘关系有时对“配对者”的影响微乎其微……无论如何，这带来了积极的效果。

Asuka stared at her like she'd just sprouted antlers. "What possible positive effects could there be to me in a threesome with that bitch?"

明日香瞪着她，仿佛她头上突然长出了鹿角。“跟那个贱人搞三人行，对我能有什么好处？”

"It sure made Rei-chan like being human more. In particular, she loved you both very much. When Commander Ikari tried to get her to set off the Third Impact, she told him to go copulate with himself, then flew to help you two fight SEELE's forces. Fighting together, you three beat them all easily. Averted the Third Impact entirely. The three of you were very happy together for a long time afterward."

这确实让绫波丽更喜欢做人了。尤其是，她非常爱你们俩。当碇司令试图让她引发第三次冲击时，她让他自食其果，然后飞去帮助你们俩对抗 SEELE 的势力。并肩作战，你们三人轻松击败了他们，完全避免了第三次冲击。之后很长一段时间，你们三个都非常幸福地生活在一起。

"I still don't think even saving the world is worth having to touch the First Child." Asuka shook herself. "Ick."

"我还是觉得，就算拯救世界也不值得去碰那个第一适格者。" 明日香打了个寒颤，"真恶心。"

"Infinite worlds, Asuka. Everything that can happen does somewhere, in all the myriad ways," Rayana said calmly. "Since we're done here, shall we drop you back at your cabin so you can enjoy a couple more hours to rest or 'talk' before tonight's ball?"

“无限的世界，明日香。一切可能发生的事情，在某个地方，以无数种方式上演，”雷亚娜平静地说道。“既然这里的事情已经结束，我们送你回舱房，让你多享受几个小时的休息或‘交谈’，然后迎接今晚的舞会，如何？”

"Yes." Shinji and Asuka looked at each other. They'd spoken in stereo again. And they both sounded pretty eager to get away.

"是的。" 真嗣和明日香对视了一眼。他们又一次异口同声地回答。而且听上去两人都急切地想要离开。

Rayana smiled again. "You two are just precious. Have fun. We'll see you at 2100 or so. Ja ne!" She lightly snapped her fingers, and they vanished.

蕾安娜再次微笑道：“你们俩真是可爱极了。玩得开心点。我们大概 2100 见。再见啦！”她轻轻打了个响指，两人便消失了。

Part 36 第 36 章

Knowing Who You Are 了解自我

They were back in their cabin's living room, just as suddenly as they'd been removed from it hours ago. Shinji was again sitting in the corner of the couch, with Asuka now standing next to him. Shinji looked up at Asuka as she tugged on his hand to get him to rise. "Come on, Shinji, stand up."

他们突然回到了小屋的客厅，就像几小时前突然离开时一样。真嗣再次坐在沙发的一角，而明日香此刻正站在他旁边。真嗣抬头看向明日香，她正拉着他的手，示意他站起来。“快点，真嗣，站起来。”

Shinji rose, but asked "Why?" as he did.

真嗣站起身来，同时问道：“为什么？”

Asuka pulled him after her towards the hallway to the bedrooms. Shinji gulped.

明日香拉着他朝卧室的走廊走去。真嗣咽了口唾沫。

"Because I really want something better to wash out my brain after the disgusting idea of sex with her polluted it. And we just had 'the talk' from yours, so I want to..." Asuka slowed her quick walk to barely a shuffle. "...to introduce you to... my mother."

"因为我实在想找些更好的东西来清洗我那被和她发生关系的恶心念头污染的大脑。而且我们刚从你那里听了'那番话'，所以我想……" 明日香放慢了急促的步伐，几乎变成了拖步。"……想带你见见……我的母亲。"

Shinji gulped harder. "O-okay."

真嗣更加用力地咽了口唾沫。“好……好的。”

Donna Sriyana looked up from her book and smiled at them as they entered Kyoko's room. "Good afternoon, Asuka. Your mother rests and heals well." Her smile grew a small fraction when she sighted their handclasp. "You look happier than yesterday, inside and out."

多娜·斯里亚娜从书本中抬起头，对他们进入京子的房间时微笑着说：“下午好，明日香。你妈妈休息得很好，正在康复。”当她注意到他们紧握的手时，她的笑容又微微加深了一些。“你看起来比昨天更快乐了，内外都如此。”

''Inside and out'?' Shinji wondered.

“内外兼修？” 真嗣疑惑着。

The priestess's eyes drifted to Shinji. "And is this young man the Shinji you spoke of yesterday?"

女祭司的目光飘向了真嗣。“这位年轻人就是你昨天提到的真嗣吗？”

'Asuka talked about me? I wonder how many times 'baka' was used in that conversation?' Shinji nervously bowed "Um, hello, ma'am. I am Shinji Ikari, yes."

明日香提到我了？不知道那次对话里用了多少次“笨蛋”这个词？” 真嗣紧张地鞠了一躬，“呃，您好，女士。我是碇真嗣，是的。”

"Don't 'ma'am' her, baka, she's a priestess. Call her 'Donna' or Mother," Asuka muttered to him as she gently elbowed him.

别叫她'夫人'，笨蛋，她是祭司。叫她'唐娜'或母亲，" 明日香小声对他说，同时轻轻用胳膊肘碰了他一下。

"Ow. Um, Mother." “哎哟。呃，妈妈。”

"Gently, Asuka dear. Boys are slow learners, and easily breakable. I sense you want to talk to your mother about something important, so I'll leave you alone." As she stepped around them to leave, she lightly placed her hand on Shinji's shoulder. "And you be gentle with her, young man. She depends on you," she said quietly, her voice pitched just loud enough for his ears. She vanished down the hall.

“轻点儿，明日香。男孩子学得慢，又容易受伤。我感觉到你想和你妈妈谈些重要的事，所以我就不打扰你们了。”她绕过他们准备离开时，轻轻地将手放在了真嗣的肩上。“你也要对她温柔些，小伙子。她依赖着你。”她轻声说道，声音刚好能让他的耳朵听见。随后她便消失在了走廊尽头。

Asuka had missed the priestess's parting comment to him, settling into the chair next to the bed that Mother Sriyana had just vacated. "Hello, Mama. I'd like to introduce you to Shinji. He's the one I told you about earlier. The one who...loves me."

明日香错过了女祭司临别时对他说的话，坐进了床边母亲斯里亚娜刚空出的椅子。“你好，妈妈。我想向你介绍真嗣。他就是我之前跟你提过的那个人。那个……爱我的人。”

Shinji pulled another chair closer to sit next to Asuka. He looked at Kyoko's face, once again struck by the resemblance to Asuka's familiar features he could see there. He looked at Asuka's face again and his jaw dropped.

真嗣又拉了一把椅子过来，坐在明日香旁边。他再次凝视着绫波丽的脸庞，又一次被那与明日香熟悉面容的相似之处所震撼。他再次看向明日香的脸，不禁惊讶得张大了嘴巴。

Asuka was crying. She was still smiling and wasn't making the sound of even a single sniffle, but to two trails of tears traced their way down her cheeks as she held her mother's hand. Shinji had never seen Asuka cry without trying to hide it in the entire time he'd known her, outside of her sleep. Now she was not making even the slightest such attempt, just holding her mother's hand, smiling, and talking happily to her, telling her mother how they'd volunteered for the campaign to rebuild their world, how they were going to be commissioned as officers at a ball tonight, how they were going to be dancing in front of everyone, how Shinji was a pretty good kisser...

明日香在哭泣。她依旧面带微笑，甚至没有发出一丝抽泣声，但两行泪水却悄然滑过她的脸颊，而她正紧握着母亲的手。真嗣从未见过明日香在他认识她的这段时间里，除了在睡梦中，不试图隐藏自己的哭泣。此刻，她丝毫没有掩饰的意图，只是握着母亲的手，微笑着，愉快地与母亲交谈，告诉她他们如何志愿参与了重建世界的运动，今晚他们将作为军官在舞会上被授衔，他们将在众人面前翩翩起舞，还有真嗣其实是个相当不错的接吻者……

Shinji's ears sent an urgent alert that he should stop staring at the tender spectacle of a smiling, teary Asuka and pay attention to those last few bits. 'Wait, what? Dancing? And what was that last one?' "Asuka, wait, don't tell her that kind of thing!" Shinji blushed brightly.

真嗣的耳朵发出紧急警报，提醒他别再盯着阿苏卡那泪眼含笑的温柔场景，该注意那最后几句话了。'等等，什么？跳舞？还有最后那是什么？' "阿苏卡，等等，别跟她说那种事！" 真嗣顿时满脸通红。

Asuka turned to look at him, her smile shifting to a grin. "Why not, Shinji? Mama's not going to hold it against you. And I tell Mama everything." Her free hand shot out to grab his collar and pull him into a thorough kiss. She released him slowly. "Mm, and why shouldn't I tell her that? She's going to be seeing more than a little of it when she wakes up in a few days. I don't feel like stopping doing something that makes me feel that good no matter who we're in front of; Mama, our weird hosts, Misato and Kaji, Wondergirl, anybody." She snorted. "Maybe especially her. What's the matter, Third? Not enjoying it? You're not ashamed to be seen kissing the hottest Pilot on Earth, are you?"

明日香转头看向他，笑容转为咧嘴一笑。“为什么不呢，真嗣？妈妈不会怪你的。我可是什么都跟妈妈说的。”她空着的手迅速伸出，抓住他的衣领，将他拉入一个深吻。她缓缓放开他。“嗯，我为什么不能告诉她呢？她过几天醒来时，会看到更多。不管我们在谁面前，我都不想停止做让我感觉这么好的事；妈妈、我们那些奇怪的主人、美里和加持、奇迹少女，任何人。”她嗤笑一声。“或许尤其是她。怎么了，第三适格者？不享受吗？你不会因为被看到亲吻地球上最火辣的驾驶员而感到羞耻吧？”

"N-no, Asuka! I'm really, really enjoying it! I don't want to stop...um."

不，明日香！我真的，真的很享受！我不想停下来...呃。

She laughed. "Dummkopf pervertieren! Get a few naughty ideas from talking to Rayana? Did you sneak a few of those pamphlets home?"

她笑道：“傻瓜变态！跟雷亚娜聊天学了些坏点子？是不是偷偷带了几本小册子回家？”

Shinji tried not to turn any redder. "We did talk about things besides sex, you know."

真嗣努力不让自己脸更红。“我们确实也聊了些与性无关的事，你知道的。”

"I'm sure you did, but watching you get so embarrassed is funny. Like what?"

"我肯定你这么做了，但看你这么尴尬的样子真有趣。比如什么？"

"How to ...listen to girls, sort of. How girls don't always say out loud what they mean you to hear."

如何……倾听女孩的心声，有点儿这个意思。女孩们并非总是直白地说出她们希望你理解的话。

"Oh?" Asuka's smile had dimmed a little from the almost predatory peak it had just hit, but didn't go away. Somehow Shinji still felt almost as nervous. "Like what, oh great philosopher baka-Shinji?"

"哦？" 明日香的笑容从刚才几乎掠食者的顶峰稍稍黯淡了一些，但并未消失。不知怎的，真嗣仍然感到几乎同样紧张。"比如说什么，哦伟大的哲学家傻瓜真嗣？"

"Like when you say 'I don't want to talk about it', you can mean 'this is important, so I do want to talk about it, but not right now'," he ventured cautiously. "So when you said it the night we arrived, it was too much for you to talk about then." 'And do I dare do it now? I mean, it was us, right? So shouldn't I know? Rayana wouldn't have mentioned it if there wasn't a reason, right?' "Do you want to now?"

就像当你说“我不想谈论这件事”时，你的意思可能是“这件事很重要，所以我确实想谈论它，但现在不行”，他小心翼翼地试探道。“所以当我们到达那晚你这么说时，那对你来说太沉重了，无法立即谈论。”“那我现在敢说吗？我是说，那是关于我们，对吧？那我难道不应该知道吗？如果不是有原因，拉亚娜不会提及的，对吧？”“你现在想谈吗？”

Asuka's smile did fade out now, and a serious look replaced it. She looked back at her mother. "…No, not really. But Daniel and I just talked about trust and …doubt. And choosing who you are. So…" Asuka took a deep breath. "I saw… She was wearing a ring. The other me."

明日香的笑容此刻确实消失了，取而代之的是一脸严肃。她回头望向母亲。“……不，也不全是。但丹尼尔和我只是谈到了信任和……怀疑。还有选择自己是谁。所以……”明日香深吸了一口气。“我看见了……另一个我戴着戒指。”

"The 'you' from when we came? A ri-" His brain caught up. 'A ring. She was wearing a ring. She was holding hands with, kissing, and very close to 'me'. And, let's not forget, pregnant. A ring. With me. Ergo, at some point in the next six months….Oh Gods…' 'Did he ask you? Or did you ask him?' suddenly made terrifying sense. 'Oh Gods…what's the answer to that?!' Shinji stared at Asuka wide-eyed.

我们刚来时的那个'你'？一个环——他的思绪跟上了。'一个戒指。她戴着戒指。她正与'我'牵手、亲吻，关系非常亲密。而且，别忘了，她还怀孕了。一个戒指。和我。因此，在接下来的六个月里……哦，天啊……' '是他向你求婚的？还是你向他求婚的？'这个问题突然变得可怕起来。'哦，天啊……这个问题的答案是什么？！' 真嗣睁大眼睛盯着明日香。

She just nodded. "Now do you see why I said that? And all she did when I saw it was look at …her 'you' and wink. I think I was screwing with myself." She shook her head to clear it. "And right now, I'm not going to worry about it. The future will take care of itself. Six months from now I'll worry about it. For now, I'm with Mama, you've told me…and we're about to ride out to save our world with an army on our side…I'm happier than I've been in too long. And I choose to stay that way." She looked at Shinji again. "What else did you talk about, perv?" Her smile was back. "How to listen to girls when they say 'harder!'?"

她只是点了点头。“现在你明白我为什么那么说了吧？当我看到那一幕时，她只是看着……她的‘你’，眨了眨眼。我想我是在自寻烦恼。”她摇了摇头，试图清醒一下。“而现在，我不会为此烦恼。未来自有安排。六个月后再去担心吧。眼下，我和妈妈在一起，你已经告诉我了……我们即将率领大军去拯救我们的世界……我比很久以来都要快乐。我选择保持这种状态。”她再次看向真嗣。“你们还聊了些什么，变态？”她的笑容又回来了。“比如怎么听懂女孩子说‘再用力点！’时的意思？”

'Rayana lied! Women do have psychic powers!' "Um...um…yes? H-how did you know that? Wait, she told you what we talked about!"

'雷亚娜撒谎了！女性确实拥有心灵感应能力！' "呃...呃…是的？你...你怎么知道的？等等，她告诉你我们谈论的内容了！"

"Yeah, but it's fun watching your turn red as a tomato when I ask you about sex," Asuka grinned. "You are way too easy, Third. Gimme details."

"是啊，但看你被我问到性话题时脸红得像番茄一样，还挺有趣的，" 明日香咧嘴笑道，"你也太好对付了，第三。给我说说细节。"

'I was right, she is trying to kill me by terminal embarrassment.' "You…you're just teasing me again." He turned away, getting ready to stand up and leave.

我猜对了，她正试图通过极度尴尬来置我于死地。"你……你又在逗我了。"他转过身，准备站起来离开。

Asuka's hand grabbed his and pulled him back down. She looked him straight in the eye with a dead serious expression this time. "Not this time, Shinji. I can't say 'not anymore', because it's still too much fun, but this time I'm serious. I want to know what she told you because…because Daniel reminded me I am the one who decides who I am. That I choose how to be who I am every moment. I am tired of being alone, of being afraid of feeling good, of hating everything in my life and still fearing to change any of it. He keeps asking us what we want? I want my life back. Fuck Wondergirl, fuck Winthrop, fuck the whole Third Impact, and fuck the Angels too. I'm reclaiming my life from all of them. I don't know what we are yet, Shinji, but I am going to decide what I feel, not the scars they left in me. I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I choose my fate."

明日香的手紧紧抓住他的，将他拉了回来。这一次，她直视他的眼睛，表情异常严肃。“这次不行，真嗣。我不能说‘不再’，因为这仍然太有趣了，但这次我是认真的。我想知道她告诉了你什么，因为……因为丹尼尔提醒了我，我是决定自己是谁的人。我选择每一刻如何成为我自己。我厌倦了孤独，厌倦了害怕感受美好，厌倦了憎恨生活中的每一件事，却仍然害怕改变任何一点。他一直在问我们想要什么？我想要回我的生活。去他的奇迹少女，去他的温斯洛普，去他的第三次冲击，还有那些该死的天使。我要从他们所有人手中夺回我的生活。我还不知道我们是什么，真嗣，但我会决定我的感受，而不是他们留给我的伤痕。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我将选择我的命运。”

Shinji was doing his best impersonation of a deer in the high-beams of a Mack truck, pinned to his chair by the force of Asuka's rant. Not that he had any intention of moving an inch now. 'This…is the girl I fell for. Welcome back, Asuka.'

真嗣正竭力模仿一只被麦卡车前灯照得目瞪口呆的鹿，被明日香的长篇大论牢牢钉在椅子上。并非他此刻有丝毫移动的打算。“这就是我为之倾心的女孩。欢迎回来，明日香。”

She stared far past Shinji for a moment. "I know who I am," she whispered. She focused back in on him. "And when I want to know what Rayana talked to you about sex, it's not just because you are fun to watch squirming in embarrassment. It's also because…I might want to know it too." The laser-focus look was back, but a lot less hostile than he was used to. It was even more intimidating now, though.

她凝视着新二身后的远方片刻，轻声道：“我知道自己是谁。”随即目光重新聚焦在他身上，“而当我想要了解雷亚娜和你谈论的关于性的话题时，并非仅仅因为你尴尬扭捏的样子有趣。还因为……我也可能想要知道那些。”那激光般的专注眼神再次出现，却比他习惯中的少了许多敌意，如今反而更令人心生畏惧。

He swallowed again. "S-she talked about…um, you. A-and how I need to listen with more than my ears, and pay attention to you."

他再次咽了咽口水。“她谈到了……呃，关于你。还有我需要用不止耳朵去倾听，要更加关注你。”

Her right eyebrow rose. "Go on."

她右边的眉毛挑起。“继续。”

"How I was…sort of insulting you and hurting you when I would ignore you, not even look at you when you were…being sexy, even when it was to tease me. How when I ignored you for so long when you were trying to get my attention, then…did that in the hospital, it was like I was pointedly using you for my own pleasure, but refusing to give you the same. She told me I was hurting you without even meaning to by kind of throwing your sexuality back in your face." Asuka's look wasn't darkening or getting angry, but it was distinctly more tense. He pushed on. "And that if I was going to love you, I'd better not 'half-ass it' and I should make it really clear I appreciate your hotness and what you mean to me and…and… when you decide you want more than a kiss, you're probably going to come at me with the same fierceness you do with everything you set your mind to. So the next time 'washing your back' comes up I better be ready when you say 'get to it'. That I better be ready to push back, but not to be afraid, because I trust you." Shinji held his breath. 'Please don't explode, please don't explode…'

我如何……在忽视你、甚至不看你的时候，无意中伤害了你，即使你当时……是在性感地挑逗我。当我长时间无视你，试图引起我的注意时，就像在医院里那样……我似乎是在故意利用你来满足自己的欲望，却拒绝给予你同样的回应。她告诉我，我无意中伤害了你，仿佛将你的性感抛回你面前。"明日香的表情并未变得阴沉或愤怒，但明显更加紧张。他继续说道："如果我打算爱你，就不能'半途而废'，我应该明确表示我欣赏你的魅力以及你对我意味着什么，还有……当你决定想要的不只是一个吻时，你可能会以你对待任何决心的那种强烈方式来面对我。所以下次提到'帮你洗背'时，我最好在你说'开始吧'时做好准备。我应该准备好回应，但不要害怕，因为我信任你。"真嗣屏住呼吸。'请不要爆发，请不要爆发……'

But Asuka just held that sharp focus right at him. "Damn right you better be ready, Third. Didn't I tell you, if you wanna love me, you better be ready to push back? I won't accept a half-ass boyfriend, you understand me? You better put as much into this as I will."

但明日香只是紧紧地盯着他，目光锐利。“你最好做好准备，第三。我不是告诉过你吗，如果你想爱我，你最好准备好反击？我不会接受一个半吊子的男朋友，你明白我的意思吗？你最好像我一样全力以赴。”

Shinji's ears insisted over the stubborn objections of his brain that yes, that was exactly what Asuka had just said. His brain objected again that Asuka couldn't possibly have said what the ears had reported she'd just said, ergo, he must be dreaming again. This was an even better dream than this morning. 'Then again, the last time I thought I was dreaming something this nice, I was just a little wrong. But it still ended up really good in the end. Therefore, I'm going to run with it as far as I can. …oh, crap. What do I say?' "I… will. I always will."

真嗣的耳朵坚持认为，尽管他的大脑顽固地反对，但没错，那就是明日香刚刚说的话。他的大脑再次反驳，认为明日香不可能说出耳朵所报告的内容，因此，他一定又在做梦了。这比今早的梦还要美妙。“不过，上次我以为自己在做这样的美梦时，其实我有点弄错了。但最终结果还是非常好的。所以，我要尽可能地沉浸其中。……哦，糟糕。我该说什么？”“我……会的。我永远都会。”

"Good," Asuka said firmly, but a smile spread back across her face to match the one Shinji could feel on his own. She squeezed his hand and her mother's and looked back down at her mother's face. "Because I've got everything I want now, and I am going to keep it."

"好，"明日香坚定地说，但笑容又在她脸上绽放，与真嗣自己感受到的笑容相映成趣。她紧握着他的手和母亲的手，再次低头看向母亲的容颜。"因为我现在拥有了所有我想要的，而且我会守护好这一切。"

### Chapter 21 Clothes & The Firsy Yime In Years

They sat silently with Kyoko for a long while, Asuka never releasing her grip on either person. Eventually, she let go of her mother's hand and stood. "Come on, Shinji. We've only got a few hours to get ready for this ball, so we'd better get started."

他们默默地与京子坐了许久，明日香始终未曾松开紧握两人的手。最终，她放开了母亲的手，站起身来。“走吧，真嗣。我们只有几个小时准备这场舞会，得抓紧时间了。”

He stood with her and let himself be pulled along by her hand. "'Only a few hours'? How long does it take to put on a set of clothes?" he said, very puzzled.

他站在她身边，任由她牵着手前行。“‘只有几个小时’？穿一套衣服需要多久？”他十分困惑地说。

Asuka sighed and rolled her eyes. "You are such a boy, Third Child. A formal dress ball, hundreds of people there, and you'd just show up with an outfit you threw on? You have no idea what you are talking about, I can see." She sniffed. "I'm sure you can just put on the uniforms they're supposed to have sent… us. Oh, they're already here."

明日香叹了口气，翻了个白眼。“你真是个孩子，第三适格者。正式的舞会，几百人参加，你就打算随便穿件衣服去？你根本不知道自己在说什么，我看出来了。”她哼了一声。“我敢肯定，你只要穿上他们本该送来的制服就行……哦，已经到了。”

Asuka trailed off as she pulled Shinji into their bedroom and sighted the two sets of dark green uniforms already there, standing by the foot of their bed on a pair of basic mannequins, one male, one female , making easy to see whose was whose. Small gold-embroidered black nametapes on the right breast confirmed it. Asuka peered closer at her uniform. There was already a set of small campaign ribbons on hers, and a gold pendant of a lion with a couple of short spears in its flank pawing at the air hung around the uniform's neck on a scarlet ribbon. Shinji looked at his. His had a similar set, but at the top line had only one gold and one or two silver stars on each of the two ribbons there, where Asuka had two gold and two sliver on the first.

明日香一边说着，一边拉着真嗣走进他们的卧室，目光落在床脚旁的两套深绿色制服上，它们分别挂在男女基本款的人体模型上，一目了然地标明了归属。右胸上小小的金色刺绣黑色名牌证实了这一点。明日香凑近自己的制服细看，上面已经缀有一排小战役勋带，一条猩红色缎带上悬挂着一枚金质狮子吊坠，狮子侧腹插着几支短矛，正挥舞着爪子。真嗣看向自己的制服，上面也有类似的勋带，但在最顶端的两个勋带上，他只有一颗金星和一两颗银星，而明日香的第一条勋带上则有两颗金星和两颗银星。

"Huh. Our own uniforms, and I have no idea what these ribbons mea-" He brushed his fingers across the ribbons and suddenly the knowledge of exactly what they meant was there in his head. 'Ikari Shinji, Evangelion (Mecha) Pilot. Seven Angel kills, six assists. Four Purple Hearts. 2015 Angel War, 2020 UN Revolution Campaign medals. Evangelion Pilot Badge, Third Impact Survivor Badge, Lifesaving Medal…' He yanked his hand back like the ribbons had bit him. It was like someone reading off his record in his head. "Wow… Asuka, try touching your ribbons."

“哈？我们自己的制服，可我完全不知道这些绶带是什么意思——”他手指轻抚过绶带，突然间，关于它们确切含义的知识涌入脑海。‘碇真嗣，EVA（机甲）驾驶员。七次天使击杀，六次助攻。四枚紫心勋章。2015 年天使战争，2020 年联合国革命运动勋章。EVA 驾驶员徽章，第三次冲击幸存者徽章，救生奖章……’他猛地抽回手，仿佛绶带咬了他一口。就像有人在他脑海中宣读他的履历。“哇……明日香，试试触碰你的绶带。”

She looked at him, shrugged, and touched her hand to her own. She stiffened and her eyes glazed over for a moment. She shook her head as she pulled her hand away. "That's… weird. But handy. Heh, Twelve kills, six assists, and the Wounded Lion for going down still fighting. Looks like I beat you, Third Child."

她看着他，耸了耸肩，用手触碰了自己的手。她身体一僵，眼神瞬间呆滞。她摇了摇头，抽回手说：“这……真奇怪。但挺方便的。嘿，十二次击杀，六次助攻，还有‘受伤的狮子’称号，因为我倒下时还在战斗。看来我赢了你，三号孩子。”

"Twelve?" "十二？"

"Three Angel kills, nine Mass Production Evas. Looks like you and I split credit for the two MPs in the coup and a couple of the Angels. See, if you gotten off your ass and come help me in that battle, you might have gotten an assist or two. I'd still have slaughtered all of SEELE's Evas myself, of course," Asuka said haughtily. "You'd better step up next time, or I'll leave you even further in the dust."

三只天使击杀，九台量产型 EVA。看来你我平分了政变中的两台量产机和几只天使的功劳。瞧，要是你当时能动动屁股来帮我，或许还能蹭到一两次助攻。当然，SEELE 的所有 EVA 我还是会独自屠戮干净，”明日香傲慢地说道，“下次你最好加把劲，否则我会把你甩得更远。

Long acquaintance with her allowed Shinji to all too easily hear the note of bitterness in her voice that still underscored any thinking of that long ago battle. And now he was sworn to make up that debt however he could. "Jawohl, my darling. I promised, remember? Every battle from now on, I'm there."

与她长久相处的经历让真嗣轻易就能听出她声音中那抹挥之不去的苦涩，每当回忆起那场久远的战斗时，这苦涩总会悄然浮现。如今，他誓言无论如何都要弥补这份亏欠。“遵命，亲爱的。我承诺过的，记得吗？从今往后的每一场战斗，我都会在场。”

"Good. I'm still probably going to wear a dress, but let's see how we look in these. Ah, they're already tailored, I think. Excellent." Asuka reached up behind her back and unzipped her dress. She was bent over facing away from him and down to her underwear before she noticed Shinji's red-faced paralysis. Her eyes flicked downward for a second to confirm her guess. "Something on your mind, Third?" she said amusedly.

"好。我可能还是会穿裙子，但先看看我们穿这些的效果吧。啊，它们似乎已经量身定做了，我想。太棒了。" 明日香伸手到背后拉下拉链，脱下裙子。她弯着腰，背对着他，直到只剩内衣时，才注意到真嗣满脸通红地僵在那里。她的目光向下扫了一秒，确认了自己的猜测。"有什么心事吗，第三适格者？" 她带着戏谑的语气问道。

'Stop staring at her ass, stop staring at her ass… oh gods it's soooo nice.' "Um…. um… yes?"

别盯着她的屁股看了，别盯着她的屁股看了……哦天哪，真是太棒了。"呃……呃……是的？"

Asuka looked slightly surprised. She straightened up from pulling her socks off and turned to face him, hands on her hips in a pose that had never failed to drive him nuts in the past. "Oh?" she asked lightly. "Feeling brave after that talk?" Her eyes narrowed a hair. "Show me," she challenged him.

明日香看起来略感惊讶。她从脱袜子的姿势中挺直身子，转过身来面对他，双手叉腰，这个姿势在过去从未失效，总能让他心神不宁。“哦？”她轻声问道，“那番谈话后感觉勇敢了？”她的眼睛微微眯起，“让我看看，”她向他发出挑战。

'I think this is the point where 'be honest' and 'appreciate her hotness' are going to combine to get me killed if I'm wrong here,' Shinji thought. 'Oh well, at least I'll go out in memorable style.' He squared his shoulders. "I was looking at your… your ass. It's… really hot."

我想这就是“诚实”和“欣赏她的魅力”交汇之处，如果我判断失误，可能会要了我的命，”真嗣心想。“唉，至少我会以一种难忘的方式离开。”他挺直了肩膀。“我刚才在看你的……你的臀部。它……真的很迷人。”

Asuka took a couple steps toward him, stopping with her just centimeters in front of him. "And?"

明日香向前走了几步，停下时与他仅相隔几厘米。“然后呢？”

"'And?'" he managed to echo with his voice rising only halfway to a squeak. "You asked what was on my mind. That was it."

"‘还有呢？’" 他勉强重复道，声音只勉强提高到半尖叫的程度。"你问我在想什么。就是那个。"

"Oh?" she purred. "Nothing else? No plans? Not going to do anything? Not going to …push?"

"哦？" 她柔声道，"没别的了？没计划？不打算做点什么？不打算……推动一下？"

'Oh gods, please don't let me screw this up!' Shinji closed the remaining space between them to put his hands around Asuka's waist and pull her to him. Asuka's expression didn't flicker, but he could see the pulse at her throat speed up. "Well, I did think…" 'Well, she didn't kill me for it this morning.' "…that you might want to take a shower before dressing for the ball …and wash your back."

'哦，天啊，千万别让我搞砸了！' 碇真嗣缩短了他们之间的最后一点距离，双手环住明日香的腰，将她拉向自己。明日香的神情没有丝毫波动，但他能看见她喉咙处的脉搏加速跳动。"嗯，我确实想过……" '至少今早她没因为这个杀了我。' "……你可能想在换上舞会服装前洗个澡……顺便帮你洗洗背。"

Asuka stared right back into his eyes for a moment that Shinji steadfastly assured himself only felt like eternity. "Yes, that might be a good idea … Start the water, …Shinji."

明日香直视着他的眼睛，那一刻，真嗣坚定地告诉自己，虽然感觉像是永恒，但实际上只是一瞬。“是的，这或许是个好主意……开始放水吧，……真嗣。”

He turned and headed into the bathroom. His feet and hands were fortunately working pretty well under automatic control, which was great news, since his brain was now entirely occupied with a steady loop of, "Holy shit! This is happening! Holy shit!". He turned on the shower and set it to moderately warm. He stood there for a minute trying to think of what he should do next, besides his growing impulse to pinch the Hell out of his arm to really, really ensure that he wasn't dreaming. He was so lost in his furiously, futilely spinning thoughts that he almost jumped a foot in the air when he felt a hand hesitantly touch his shoulder. He spun in place.

他转身走进浴室。幸运的是，他的手脚在自动控制下运作得相当不错，这真是个好消息，因为他的大脑此刻完全被“天哪！这真的发生了！天哪！”的循环占据。他打开淋浴，调至适中的温度。站在那里，他试图思考接下来该做什么，除了那股越来越强烈的冲动——狠狠地掐自己的手臂，以确保这不是一场梦。他沉浸在疯狂而徒劳的思绪中，以至于当一只手犹豫地触碰他的肩膀时，他几乎吓得跳了起来。他原地转过身去。

Asuka looked back at him with a mix of slight sarcasm and partly-hidden nervousness. "You planning to get in that shower with all your clothes on, Third? I'm not undressing you for you."

明日香回头看着他，眼神中带着些许讽刺，又隐约透露出紧张。“你打算穿着衣服进淋浴间吗，三号？我可不会帮你脱衣服。”

Shinji was completely unable to stop his eyes from yo-yoing down and back up her body. Yup, she was naked. Gloriously, stunningly naked, that perfect body that had been in so many of his dreams, and yes, a few shameful memories, now totally on display. He'd seen her body before; comatose in a hospital gown, drowning herself in her bathtub in Berlin, most nights they'd gone to sleep next to each other over the last month, or even their one disastrous try at sex. This wasn't like any of those times. This was something as different as it could get. She wasn't avoiding his gaze and he wasn't invading. She was right in front of him, looking right back at him, hands on her hips again.

真嗣完全无法控制自己的目光在她身上上下游移。是的，她一丝不挂。那具曾在无数梦境中出现、完美无瑕的身躯，如今毫无遮掩地展现在他眼前，令人目眩神迷。他曾见过她的身体：在医院昏迷时穿着病号服，在柏林的浴缸中试图溺水自尽，过去一个月里大多数夜晚他们相拥而眠，甚至还有那次失败的性爱尝试。但这次截然不同。她没有回避他的目光，他也没有侵犯之意。她就站在他面前，直视着他，双手再次叉在腰间。

A frantically active part of his brain finally got through with the message that he'd been staring at her in silence for almost thirty seconds. "Um! Yes! Right, clothes!" He shrugged out of his shirt and pants in record time. His hands froze for a second as he got to his boxers. He usually slept in them, so he'd hardly been as naked in front of Asuka as much as she had been in front of him. 'Another signal I missed?' flitted through his mind. And he wouldn't just be naked in a moment; he'd be rather obviously showing off his 'interest' as well. And he was a lot more 'interested' than he'd been during their awkward attempt at sex. He got a grip on his nerves and slid his boxers off.

他脑海中一个极度活跃的部分终于传达出信息：他已经沉默地盯着她看了近三十秒。“呃！对！衣服！”他以破纪录的速度脱掉衬衫和裤子。当手触到内裤时，他的动作停滞了一瞬。他通常穿着内裤睡觉，所以在明日香面前，他几乎不曾像她在他面前那样裸露。‘我又错过了什么信号吗？’这个念头一闪而过。而且，他不仅即将赤裸，还会明显地展示出他的‘兴趣’。与他们那次尴尬的性尝试相比，他此刻的‘兴趣’要强烈得多。他稳住心神，将内裤也褪去。

His head came back up to not meet Asuka's eyes. She was still looking down at him. This time Shinji got to be on the other end of the awkward pause before Asuka blinked and snapped her head back up. "Ah! Er… I… never um, looked before. I didn't want to see, so I hadn't ever… you're… um… a bit more than… the other two. A lot more… um… let's get in the shower, baka!" She turned him around and pushed him towards the shower door.

他的头再次抬起，却避开了明日香的目光。她依旧低头看着他。这次，轮到真嗣体验尴尬的沉默了，直到明日香眨了眨眼，猛地抬头。“啊！呃…我…从没，嗯，仔细看过。我不想看，所以从未…你…嗯…比那两个要…多很多…嗯…去洗澡吧，笨蛋！”她将他转过身，推着他朝淋浴间门走去。

"I'm what?" Shinji got out before he was inside, facing the spray from the multiple showerheads.

"我这是怎么了？" 真嗣还没完全进入浴室，就迎面遭遇了多个花洒喷出的水雾。

"Never mind," Asuka said, getting directly under the spray from the largest showerhead and wetting herself down thoroughly. She pointed towards a shelf at the back of the stall with an array of soaps and shampoos on it. "Grab the cream body wash and the scrub mitts."

"没关系," 明日香说着，直接站在最大的花洒下，让水流彻底打湿自己。她指向隔间后部的一个架子，上面摆满了各种肥皂和洗发水。"拿那瓶乳状沐浴露和搓澡巾。"

She gathered her hair into her hand and pulled it over her right shoulder to offer him unimpeded access to the silky smooth skin of her back all the way down to the swell of her perfect, smooth- FOCUS, Ikari!

她将头发拢入手中，拉至右肩前，让他得以毫无阻碍地触及她那光滑如丝的背部，直至完美无瑕、平滑的曲线——集中注意力，碇！

He squirted some of the body wash into the mitts and rubbed them together to work up a lather. He tried to keep his hands from shaking too badly as he gingerly reached out and placed his mitt-covered hands on her back. She jumped a little at his touch too, but began to relax as he slowly, slowly began to rub his hands in circles across her back.

他将一些沐浴露挤入手套中，搓揉双手以起泡沫。他努力控制着不让手颤抖得太厉害，小心翼翼地伸出手，将戴着手套的双手放在她的背上。她在他触碰时也微微一跳，但随着他缓慢地、缓缓地在她的背上以圆周运动揉搓双手，她开始放松下来。

"Mm… harder," was all she said. He pressed a little more firmly.

"嗯……再用力点，"她只说了这么一句。他便稍加用力地按了下去。

"Asuka?" He asked after a few minutes, his hands ever so slowly and carefully starting to drift lower and wider.

"明日香？" 几分钟后他问道，双手开始缓慢而谨慎地向下并向两侧移动。

"Mm?" she replied vaguely, starting to arch a bit into his strokes.

“嗯？”她含糊地应了一声，开始微微弓起身子迎向他抚摸的动作。

"I'm not dreaming, am I?"

我不是在做梦，对吧？

She turned her head to glance at him over her left shoulder. "You have dreams like this before, Third?"

她扭头从左肩上瞥了他一眼，“你以前做过这样的梦吗，老三？”

"A couple of times a month, when it wasn't nightmares about… things you can probably guess. I didn't like either kind."

每月有那么几次，当它不是关于……你可能猜得到的事情的噩梦时。这两种我都不喜欢。

Her left eyebrow rose skeptically. "You didn't like having dreams about a hot, naked redhead showering with you?"

她左边的眉毛怀疑地挑起。“你不喜欢梦见和一个火辣的赤裸红发女郎一起淋浴吗？”

"Because I always woke up alone."

因为我总是独自醒来。

"I didn't. It wasn't better." He could feel her back tense up a bit under his hands. She shook herself and turned around to face him. "No. I'm not going to start thinking of that. We're done with that. I… you really spent that much time dreaming of me?"

"我没有。那并不好。"他能感觉到她的背在他的手下微微绷紧。她抖了抖身子，转过来面对他。"不，我不会开始想那些。我们已经结束了。我……你真的花了那么多时间梦见我吗？"

Shinji nodded. "I did like those dreams when I had them. It was just the loss of you over and over every time I woke up that I hated. Some of those dreams were… nice." He looked to the side. He wanted to stare at his usual spot on the floor in front of him, but that would have been a different field of view right now.

真嗣点了点头。“我确实喜欢那些梦，只是每次醒来都反复失去你，这让我痛恨。有些梦……挺美好的。”他侧目而视。他本想凝视面前地板上惯常的位置，但此刻那已不是他视野中的景象。

Asuka's hand came up to his cheek and pushed his head back around to face her. "Shinji, look at me. I want you to look at me. You always have."

明日香的手伸向他的脸颊，将他的头推转过来面对自己。“真嗣，看着我。我要你看着我。你一直都是这样。”

"It's… different now." 现在……不一样了。

"Yes. It's better." The shower kept smoothly spraying them, washing the last of the soap off Asuka's back. "You told me this morning you thought I was beautiful, Shinji. Don't you find me attractive anymore?" She flicked her eyes down again at the prominent evidence and smirked.

"是的，这样更好。" 淋浴持续平稳地喷洒着，冲去了明日香背上最后一点肥皂沫。"你今早还说我漂亮，真嗣，你现在不觉得我吸引人了吗？" 她再次垂眸看向那明显的迹象，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑。

He nodded. "More than anyone else in the world."

他点头道：“比世界上任何人都多。”

"Then don't turn your eyes away. You were doing pretty good at pushing back to ask me in here. Don't wimp out now. If I was going to kill you, I'd have already done it." She tilted her head a little. "What else was in your dreams, perv?" she said with a small smile.

那就别移开你的目光。你刚才坚持要我进来的勇气还不错。现在别退缩。如果我想杀你，早就动手了。”她微微歪了歪头，“你梦里还有什么，变态？”她带着一丝微笑说道。

"You're going to laugh." "你要笑出来了。"

"Try me, Third." “试试我，第三。”

"It wasn't as perverted as you'd think." Shinji pulled off the scrub mitts and placed them back on the shelf, then stunned Asuka as he slid his arms around her back and pulled her close against him. They both shivered at the sensations. "It had parts like this…" He moved his face lower to seek her lips. "…but it was more about being close… less about the sex…" He halted just before making contact. "…more about loving you." He met her lips.

"并没有你想象中那么变态。" 真嗣脱下擦洗手套，放回架上，随后出其不意地从背后环抱住明日香，将她紧紧拥入怀中，两人因这突如其来的触感而微微颤抖。"就像这样……" 他俯下脸庞，寻找她的唇。"……但更多的是想要亲近……而非仅仅为了性……" 在即将触碰之际，他停了下来。"……更多的是爱你。" 最终，他们的唇相接。

Asuka's moan into his kiss would probably have surprised Shinji more…if he hadn't dreamed this already, and if wasn't already echoing it himself. What did surprise him was that all the pleasure of nearly five cumulative hours of intensely kissing Asuka so far today was completely blown away by a single kiss.

明日香在他的吻中发出的呻吟，或许本会让真嗣更加惊讶……如果不是他早已梦见过这一幕，如果不是他自己也在回应着这吻。真正让他惊讶的是，今天迄今为止近五个小时的激烈亲吻所带来的所有快感，竟被这一吻彻底超越。

Part 38 第三十八章

The First Time In Years

多年来的第一次

'Ok, whatever's in the water here that's making him act like this, I want him drinking at least a gallon a day,' was Asuka's only semi-coherent thought. 'I don't know where the old Third Child went, but he can stay gone. Oh Gott, his hands…'

好吧，不管这里的水里有什么让他变成这样，我希望他每天至少喝一加仑，这是明日香唯一半清醒的想法。我不知道原来的第三适格者去了哪里，但他可以消失了。哦，天哪，他的手……

Shinji's hands were indeed busy, once again tracing lines of fire up and down her back, and starting to venture elsewhere. They felt almost good enough to overwhelm her all by themselves, and likely would have, if that set of sensations hadn't been in competition with the ones generated by his equally burning lips and tongue, or the all new ones coming from her breasts and groin as she and Shinji pressed together increasingly firmly. Her blood was practically fizzing. She could feel his rampant 'interest' pressing against her stomach. She wrapped her own hands around his lower back and pulled him even closer. One of his legs slid between hers, and her motion ground her groin very firmly against his thigh. And just like that, Asuka Langley Sohryu went off like an atom bomb.

碇真嗣的双手确实忙碌，再次沿着她的背部勾勒出火焰般的线条，并开始探索其他领域。它们几乎足以单独将她淹没，若非与他的炽热唇舌所引发的感官竞争，或是随着两人愈发紧密相贴，从她的胸部和下体涌出的全新感觉，或许真能如此。她的血液几乎在沸腾。她能感受到他那勃发的“兴趣”紧贴着她的腹部。她用自己的双手环抱住他的腰背，将他拉得更近。他的腿滑入她的双腿之间，她的动作使她的下体紧紧地压在他的大腿上。就这样，惣流·明日香·兰格雷如原子弹般爆发了。

Her head snapped back and broke the so far uninterrupted kiss, which was for the best; her throaty moans were suddenly replaced by a howl that rose to a near scream. Shinji's hands around her back sharply tightened, which was also good, as right on the heels of her howl her legs gave out and only Shinji's grip saved her from sliding limply to the floor. He did stumble forward to pin her up against the wall with his body weight. She was muzzily grateful for the save, and actually rather enjoyed being firmly pressed against the wall with his body up against hers once her mental fuses reset about a minute later. She just kind of rested in his arms for another couple of minutes, not feeling at all interested or capable of moving just yet. "Mein Gott…" she mumbled. 'Oh holy fuck, that was good… How long has it been?'

她的头猛地后仰，打断了迄今为止未曾间断的吻，这反而是好事；她那低沉的呻吟声突然被一声嚎叫取代，声音高亢几近尖叫。真嗣环抱在她背上的双手骤然收紧，这也恰到好处，因为紧随嚎叫之后，她的双腿一软，若非真嗣紧握，她早已瘫软滑落地面。他踉跄前倾，用身体重量将她紧压在墙上。她昏昏沉沉地感激这次拯救，实际上，大约一分钟后，当她的思绪重新接通时，她相当享受这种被他坚实身躯紧贴墙壁的感觉。她就这样在他的臂弯里又静默了几分钟，丝毫没有动弹的意愿或能力。"我的天啊……"她喃喃自语。'天哪，那感觉太美妙了……已经多久没有这样了？'

"Asuka, are you alright?" Shinji asked.

"明日香，你没事吧？" 真嗣问道。

'Am I alright?' She managed a weak laugh. "Alright? Heh… I'm better than 'alright', Shinji. Mein Gott, it's been years..."

'我没事吧？' 她勉强挤出一丝虚弱的笑声。"没事？呵呵…我比'没事'还要好，真嗣。天哪，已经好几年了……"

"Years?" 多年？

"You think I ever got off with Winthrop? Or Jinnai? They weren't attractive even under the best circumstances, much less the ones I was in! They kind of killed sex at all for me. I haven't had an honest-to-Gott climax since my room in Misato's apartment!" Asuka slowly raised her head off Shinji's shoulder.

"你以为我曾和温斯洛普或阵内有过什么？即便在最好的情况下，他们也毫无魅力可言，更别提我当时所处的境遇了！他们几乎让我对性完全失去了兴趣。自从搬进美里公寓的房间后，我就再也没有过真正的高潮了！" 明日香缓缓地从真嗣的肩膀上抬起头来。

"Um… you didn't…" Shinji began.

"呃……你没……" 真嗣开口道。

"I was by myself, baka. Girls do it too, you know." 'Every fucking night, in fact. And back then I was fantasizing about Kaji ...and you.' she didn't say out loud. 'Fuck, Shinji, if you only knew how many times I thought about just sneaking across the hall one night and rocking your world, making you mine…' "This… was better." A little strength was flowing back into her limbs. "And you are going to be doing that again, Third. Multiple times. That… That's an order."

我一个人，傻瓜。女孩也会这么做，你知道的。实际上，每晚都如此。那时我幻想着碇真嗣……还有你。她没有大声说出来。该死，真嗣，如果你知道有多少次我想过只是偷偷穿过走廊，一夜之间震撼你的世界，让你属于我……"这样……更好。"一丝力量正重新流入她的四肢。"而你将会再次这么做，第三适格者。多次。那……那是命令。"

"I think I like those kind of orders, Asuka," Shinji said with a small smile. His arms kept her held closely against him. Asuka vaguely noted with a little pleasure that he indeed had very little spare fat on him, and what mass he did have was fairly taut muscle.

"我想我喜欢这种命令，明日香。" 真嗣带着一丝微笑说道。他的手臂紧紧地抱着她。明日香隐约带着一丝愉悦注意到，他身上确实几乎没有多余的脂肪，而他拥有的肌肉则相当紧实。

"Mmm, good, because you're going to be getting them a lot," Asuka purred. She put her left hand on his lower back again and pulled him hard against her. "C'mere." She grabbed the back of his head with her right and yanked him down into another scorching kiss.

"嗯，好，因为你以后会经常得到它们，"明日香低声说道。她再次将左手放在他的后腰上，用力将他拉向自己。"过来。"她用右手抓住他的后脑勺，猛地拉下，再次与他激烈地亲吻。

They stayed like that for a long time, Asuka positively wallowing in a kaleidoscope of sensual pleasure, feeling herself pressed up against the wall by Shinji, her nipples hard as drill bits, boring into his chest. She was grinding herself against his leg again, rapidly climbing to that sweet, sweet peak once more… when the house system beeped at them.

他们就这样持续了许久，明日香沉浸在感官愉悦的万花筒中，感受着自己被真嗣紧贴在墙上，乳尖硬如钻头，深深嵌入他的胸膛。她再次磨蹭着他的腿，迅速攀升至那甜蜜的巅峰……就在这时，屋内的系统发出了哔哔声。

"Scheduled reminder," the cool voice of the system said in German. "The time is now 1930. The 791st Independent Division Ball is scheduled to begin in two point five hours."

"预定提醒，"系统那冷静的声音用德语说道，"现在是 1930 时。第 791 独立师舞会预定在两小时三十分后开始。"

"Oh Gott damn it!" Asuka growled. "We… nggg… don't have time for this." Her body steadfastly ignored her mouth, and if anything ground against Shinji faster and harder. "We've… Gott, yes... have to get dressed!"

"哦，该死！" 明日香低吼道。"我们……呃……没时间了。" 她的身体却坚决不听从她的嘴巴，反而更加快速激烈地贴紧真嗣。"我们得……天啊，对……得穿衣服了！"

"We have to stop? Should I…" Shinji shifted his weight back and prepared to pull away.

我们得停下吗？我该……” 真嗣将重心后移，准备抽身离开。

Asuka's arms clamped down like steel. "Oh no no no… don't stop, don't you dare stop, Shinji. I'm close. I'm close. I'm close! Oh Gott, I'm so close! I'mmmmmmyyyyYEEESSSSS!" Asuka finished in a yell and slumped in his arms again. She pulled herself together slowly. "Whew. Okay… now we can get dressed. Once I can move."

明日香的臂弯紧箍如铁，“不不不……别停，你不许停，真嗣。我快到了，我快到了，我快到了！哦，上帝，我太接近了！我……是……的！”明日香一声大喊，完成了释放，再次瘫软在他的怀中。她缓缓地整理好自己，“呼。好了……现在我们可以穿衣服了。等我能动的时候。”

She could feel Shinji shake in frustration. 'Okay, no, I'm not that big of a bitch. Not this time. Not after what you just did for me, Shinji.' Her hand left his lower back and traced a line along his hip around to his front.

她能感觉到真嗣因挫败而颤抖。‘好吧，不，我没那么狠心。这次不会。在你为我做了那些之后，真嗣。’她的手从他的后腰移开，沿着他的臀部划过，绕到他的前方。

Shinji jumped as he felt her hand wrap around him. "Ah! Asuka…"

真嗣一惊，感觉到她的手环绕住了自己。“啊！明日香……”

"Shh…you got me off, twice. My turn." She tightened her grip just ever so slightly and started to move her hand. 'Mmm, quite a nice handful.'

"嘘……你让我高潮了两次，该我了。"她微微收紧了握力，开始移动她的手。"嗯，手感真不错。"

Shinji's hands on her back dug in harder. "Oh, Asuka… I'm…I! AAAAH!" He slumped forward against her, his forehead resting against the wall over her shoulder. "Oh gods," he panted. "I've never… that was… Thank you, Asuka."

真嗣的手在她背上抓得更紧了。“哦，明日香……我……我！啊啊啊！”他向前倾倒，额头抵在她肩上的墙壁上。“哦，天啊，”他喘息着说，“我从没……那真是……谢谢你，明日香。”

"Isn't it better when you let me do it, instead of just looking at me, hmm? Are we learning yet, Third Child?" Asuka said, her voice still a husky purr.

"让我来做不是更好吗，而不是只盯着我看，嗯？我们学会了吗，第三适格者？" 明日香说道，她的声音依旧带着沙哑的低吟。

"I think," Shinji panted back, "You are right. And… I think I need to sit down now."

“我想，” 真嗣喘着气回答，“你说得对。而且……我想我现在需要坐下来。”

Now it was her turn to hold him up. "No time for lying around," 'Or more playtime, more's the pity. Damn it, I feel so good if you had any clothes on right now, Third, I'd be tearing them off you. Instead we've got to put some on. It's not fair.'"We've got to get dressed and ready to walk out of here. We… we can play later." 'Don't argue with me, Shinji. I don't think I could really argue that we shouldn't keep going very hard right now. …and maybe I shouldn't think 'very hard' right now. Damn it.'

现在轮到她支撑他了。“没时间躺着了，”“更别说玩耍了，真是可惜。该死，如果你现在穿着衣服，第三，我肯定会把你衣服撕掉。相反，我们得穿上衣服。这不公平。”“我们得穿好衣服，准备离开这里。我们……我们可以晚点再玩。”“别跟我争，真嗣。我觉得现在我们真的很难坚持不继续前进。……也许我现在不该想‘很难’。该死。”

Much to her simultaneous relief and disappointment, Shinji just nodded. "Right."

令她既松了一口气又感到失望的是，真嗣只是点了点头。“对。”

Asuka pushed against his chest and turned him around. "You go get started. I'm going to wash my hair as fast as I can. And I'm pretty sure if I don't get you out of this shower right now, our resolve isn't going to hold up. Scoot."

明日香推着他的胸膛，将他转了个身。“你先开始吧。我要尽快洗个头。我敢肯定，如果现在不把你从这淋浴间弄出去，我们的决心就要动摇了。快点，走吧。”

Shinji got out and pulled on the purple robe hanging next to her crimson one. "Aww, I can't even stand here and watch?" he mock-complained. His German had the cutest weird accent.

真嗣穿上旁边那件紫色长袍，与她的绯红色长袍相映成趣。“哎呀，我连站在这里看都不行吗？”他半开玩笑地抱怨道，那口德语带着一种可爱又奇特的口音。

"Get moving, perv." 'But don't you stop looking at me. Don't you ever stop, baka-Shinji.'

快点走，变态。'但你别停下看我。你永远都别停，笨蛋真嗣。'

Asuka got out of the shower and followed Shinji into the bedroom faster than she thought she could, but it still took her a while. A request to the house for a hair dryer had gotten her a wand to be waved over her hair that took it from dripping wet to just damp enough to be styled in a single pass. Rapid but careful hairstyling and makeup application occupied her before she managed to get done with the bathroom end of preparations. She found Shinji still wrapped in his robe, staring at his uniform. He sighed and started to take it off the mannequin.

明日香洗完澡后，比自己预想的还要快地跟着真嗣走进了卧室，但仍然花了一些时间。她向屋子请求一个吹风机，却得到了一根魔杖，只需在头发上挥动一次，就能让滴水的头发变得刚好湿润到可以造型。快速而细致地打理发型和化妆占据了她的时间，直到她完成了浴室的准备工作。她发现真嗣仍然裹着浴袍，凝视着自己的制服。他叹了口气，开始从人偶上取下制服。

"You'll look good in it," she said.

"穿上它你会很好看，"她说。

He sat on the bed and started putting on the socks that had been in the shoes at the mannequin's feet. "I'm still not very comfortable with the idea of being a soldier. I never liked being a Pilot. But just like back then, it's something I have to do. To protect my friends. To make up for my past sins." He shrugged and pulled the undershirt on over his head. "And I've got more to protect now. I promised I'd be there beside you."

他坐在床边，开始穿上那些原本放在模特脚边鞋子里的袜子。“对于成为一名士兵的想法，我还是不太适应。我从来就不喜欢当飞行员。但就像那时一样，这是我必须做的。为了保护我的朋友。为了弥补我过去的罪行。”他耸了耸肩，将打底衫套过头。“现在我有更多需要保护的了。我承诺过，我会一直陪在你身边。”

Asuka walked to her wardrobe, opened it, and began to rifle through the dresses inside. It kept her back to Shinji. "That's right. You swore," she said, keeping her voice carefully steady. "You're going to stay with me until I release you. You owe me."

明日香走向她的衣柜，打开柜门，开始翻找里面的裙子。这让她背对着真嗣。“没错，你发过誓，”她说话时小心翼翼地保持声音平稳，“你要一直陪着我，直到我放你走。这是你欠我的。”

"And I love you. I go where you go."

我爱你，你去哪儿，我去哪儿。

Asuka's hand froze in its search for a dress. She pulled out the red silk full length backless gown and stepped back to see how it looked against her in the mirror built into the inside of the wardrobe door. Liking the look, she hung it on a hook on the other door as a possibility. "Then it's a good thing you're already going with me."

明日香寻找裙子的手突然停住了。她抽出那件红色真丝长款露背礼服，后退一步，想看看它在衣柜门内嵌的镜子中与自己相映成趣的样子。满意于这番景象，她将其挂在对门的挂钩上，作为备选。“那你已经决定跟我一起去，真是太好了。”

"Yeah. Lucky me," Shinji said softly and smiled just a little. Asuka quickly shifted her eyes away from the mirror before he could see her watching, and pulled out another dress.

"是啊，我真幸运。" 真嗣轻声说道，嘴角微微上扬。明日香迅速将目光从镜子上移开，以免他发现自己正在观察，随即又抽出另一件裙子。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" she replied vaguely, holding the new, forest green dress up against herself in the mirror.

"嗯？" 她含糊地应了一声，将那件崭新的森林绿裙子在镜子前比对着自己。

"Hikari was kidding, right?"

"光是在开玩笑，对吧？"

'Oh Gott I hope so.' "...yes. Yes she was." Asuka knew she didn't sound as sure as her words implied. 'And even if she wasn't, I'm…. we're catching up pretty fast.'

哦，上帝，希望如此。"...是的，她确实是。"明日香知道自己的语气并没有话语所暗示的那么确定。"即使她不是，我...我们也在迅速追赶。"

A few more minutes of searching and sampling produced nothing that Asuka liked more than the first red silk gown, so she peeled off her robe and tossed it on the bed. A quick glance in the mirror showed Shinji's back to her, taking the coat and trousers of the uniform off the bed and putting them on. She quickly pulled open her underwear drawer for a white garter belt and stockings that would go with the dress and pulled them on before Shinji could see. 'A little surprise for you later, Shinji,' she thought with a smile. That shower still had her happily glowing a bit.

又搜寻试穿了几分钟后，明日香发现没有哪件比最初那件红色丝绸礼服更合心意，于是她脱下浴袍，将其扔在床上。匆匆一瞥镜中，只见真嗣背对着她，正从床上拿起制服外套和裤子穿上。她迅速拉开内衣抽屉，取出与裙子相配的白色吊袜带和长筒袜，赶在真嗣转身前匆匆穿上。“待会儿给你个小惊喜，真嗣。”她微笑着想。沐浴后的余韵仍让她容光焕发。

She slid the dress on and snapped the choker portion that held the top up closed around her neck. A pair of elbow-length gloves in matching red and a pair of stilettos that gave her enough extra inches to almost match heights with Shinji completed the outfit. Asuka thought it over for a second as she looked at her reflection. 'No, not quite complete,' she decided. She walked over to her uniform and removed the Wounded Lion medal from around the mannequin's neck. She placed it around her own, letting the heavy gold lion rest on her chest just above her bust.

她穿上裙子，将支撑上衣的项圈部分扣紧在脖子上。一双红色及肘手套和一双高跟鞋，让她增加的身高几乎与真嗣持平，完成了装扮。明日香对着镜子审视了一会儿，心想：“不，还不算完全。”她走向制服，从模特脖子上取下“受伤的狮子”勋章，戴在自己颈间，让那沉甸甸的金色狮子徽章垂于胸前，恰好在胸部上方。

"Do you like that one?" Shinji asked from behind her.

"你喜欢那一个吗？" 真嗣在她身后问道。

"According to what that little flash informed me, the Wounded Lion is awarded for valor above and beyond the call of duty in last stands, usually posthumously. I earned this the hard way, and it's a military ball, so I'm going to wear…" She turned around. "…it?" she finished in surprise. 'Oh…very nice, Third.'

根据那短暂闪现的信息，受伤的狮子勋章是授予在绝境中展现出超越职责的英勇行为，通常是死后追授。我艰难地赢得了它，而这是一场军事舞会，所以我打算佩戴……”她转过身来，“……它？”她惊讶地结束了话语。“哦……非常漂亮，第三。”

The close-fitting dark green with gold and black trim looked very good on Shinji. He even seemed to be standing up straighter. That was the only explanation Asuka could think of for why he seemed taller. His father's broad shoulders were starting to show in him, too. He looked good enough to eat. "Not bad, baka-Shinji. Not bad," she told him. "You look good enough to be seen in public with."

深绿色搭配金黑边饰的紧身衣在真嗣身上显得格外好看，他甚至似乎站得更直了。这是明日香能想到的唯一解释，为何他看起来更高了。他父亲宽阔的肩膀也开始在他身上显现。他看起来帅气得让人想咬一口。“不错嘛，笨蛋真嗣。不错，”她对他说，“你看起来够格和我一起出现在公众场合了。”

Shinji looked at her with much brighter eyes. "You look… really good, Asuka," his soft tone saying far more than his words.

真嗣用更加明亮的目光看着她，轻声说道：“你看起来……真的很不错，明日香。”他的语气比言语传达了更多。

"Of course I do," she replied confidently. She told the small voice that wanted to cheer because it was him saying it to keep it down. The voice that just marveled, 'He really looks at me,' was not nearly as easy to subdue anymore. So she didn't.

"我当然知道，"她自信地回答。她告诉那个想要欢呼的小声音，因为是他说的，要它安静下来。那个只是惊叹着，“他真的在看我”的声音，如今已不再那么容易压制。所以她没有。

The house beeped at them again. "Apologies for the intrusion, guests. You have an incoming call from Senior Marshal of the White His Imperial Highness Lord Sir Lucas Verfico nó O'Brien. Would you like to take it in here as audio-only?"

屋子再次对他们发出哔哔声：“抱歉打扰了，客人们。您有一通来自白袍帝国高级元帅，尊贵的卢卡斯·维尔菲科·诺·奥布莱恩爵士的来电，请问您是否愿意在此仅以音频形式接听？”

"Put him through, BH," Asuka said, still admiring Shinji's new look.

"给他接通，BH，" 明日香说道，目光依旧欣赏着真嗣的新造型。

"Good evening, Pilots. Their Majesties have charged me with ensuring you both make it to the 791st Independent Division Ball in proper style and show. Are you both finished preparing for the event?"

晚上好，飞行员们。陛下们委托我确保你们俩都能以恰当的风采和表现出席第 791 独立师舞会。你们俩都准备好参加活动了吗？

"Yes we are, Lord Verfico," Asuka said.

"是的，我们是，维菲科大人，"飞鸟说道。

"Most excellent. My vehicle will be outside your cabin momentarily to pick you up and transport you to the 791st Division Headquarters complex at Fort Schelbert. Just step outside, and we'll be right with you."

非常出色。我的车辆将即刻抵达您的舱室外，接您前往施尔伯特堡 791 师总部综合区。只需走出舱门，我们便立刻与您同行。

Shinji held out his hand. "Darf ich bitten?"

真嗣伸出手。“我可以邀请你吗？”

"Bitte," Asuka said with a smile, and took his hand.

"请吧," 明日香微笑着说, 并握住了他的手。

Part 39 第三十九章

To The Ball 前往舞会

Lord Verfico proved to be shorter than he'd looked in the video call Ching had made on their first night on Avalon, but just as weathered looking, and a charming gentleman. He'd warmly greeted them after the large, heavily armed aircraft bigger than a NERV Command Truck had lightly settled onto the beach outside their cabin, and ushered them aboard. Shinji seemed slightly apprehensive at Lord Verfico's blithe statement that he was piloting the "Company Command Dropship" while standing behind the pilot's seat, talking to them without even looking forward.

维尔菲科勋爵在视频通话中看起来比实际要高，那是他们在阿瓦隆的第一晚，程进行的通话。但他的面容同样饱经风霜，且是一位迷人的绅士。当一架比 NERV 指挥卡车还要庞大的重型武装飞机轻盈地降落在他们小屋外的海滩上时，他热情地迎接了他们，并引导他们登机。真嗣对维尔菲科勋爵站在驾驶座后，边与他们交谈边驾驶“公司指挥空降艇”而不向前看的行为略感不安。

Lord Verfico noted his nervousness and laughed softly. "Relax, Pilot Ikari. I was born a very long time ago as a combat flight AI. There's not a military vehicle or ship in the multiverse I can't fly with my eyes closed."

维尔菲科勋爵注意到他的紧张，轻声笑了起来。“放松，飞行员碇。我很久以前出生时就是战斗飞行人工智能。多元宇宙中没有一种军事载具或飞船是我闭着眼睛开不了的。”

"You were 'born' an AI?" Asuka asked curiously from her comfortable seat behind the command stations. "How does that work?"

"你是'诞生'出来的 AI 吗？" 飞鸟好奇地坐在指挥台后的舒适座位上问道，"那是怎么一回事？"

"Just as it sounds, young miss. The Emperor created me long ago, before the founding of the Empire as a combat assistant computer for his Veritech fighter, to allow him to conduct other tasks while I flew it or operated the weapons. He created me and gave me awareness, and I am one of his oldest children. Much later on after he had learned how, he also gave me a soul and later a flesh and blood body for when I cared to use one, such as tonight. It would hardly be proper for Their Majesties to attend a unit Ball and their Privy Secretary not be there as well. But to reassure Pilot Ikari, I have been flying more kinds of combat aircraft than you can imagine for longer than you'd believe. Piloting this old runabout of mine is no more difficult for me than drinking tea might be for you." His hand gestured at the impressive array of ribbons on his own dark green breast. "I earned all of these flight medals the hard way. I can claim without any exaggeration to be one of the best pilots in the Empire. Don't worry at all."

正如您所听到的，小姐。皇帝在帝国建立之前很久就创造了我，作为他的变形战斗机上的战斗辅助计算机，以便我在驾驶或操作武器时，他能执行其他任务。他赋予了我意识，我是他最古老的孩子之一。后来，在他学会如何做之后，他还给了我灵魂，以及后来一个血肉之躯，当我愿意使用时，比如今晚。皇帝和皇后陛下出席部队舞会，而他们的私人秘书不在场，这显然不合适。但为了让飞行员碇君放心，我驾驶过的战斗机型种类之多，飞行时间之长，远超您的想象。驾驶我这辆老式跑车对我来说，并不比您喝茶更困难。他指着自己深绿色胸前那排排令人印象深刻的勋章说：“这些飞行奖章都是我辛苦得来的。我毫不夸张地说，我是帝国中最优秀的飞行员之一。请完全不必担心。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him. "You're a son of your Emperor, and you're playing chauffeur for us? Should we be calling you 'Prince Lucas' or such?"

明日香朝他挑了挑眉。“你是皇帝的儿子，却来给我们当司机？我们是不是该称呼你为‘卢卡斯王子’之类的？”

"If you must. I'm not a Prince Of The Blood, as the Empress is not my mother …biologically, she just reminded me. I technically didn't even have blood when I was born. Nor am I one of the Bastard Princes, as I do not technically have a mother at all. We crafted children of the Emperor are known as the Blood-Forged. While technically princes and princesses, we mostly prefer titles we've earned as a better mark of our existence. We are who we are by our own hands, not by circumstance of birth. I am a Senior Marshal of the White by virtue of combat experience and duration of service, and Lord Privy Secretary because I am good at it and it pleases Their Majesties to have me serve as such. As for my being a mere chauffeur tonight? We all serve 'at the pleasure of the Crown', as the old cant goes. And I enjoy the chance to fly some of my father's friends to a party. The privileges of being an old constructed intelligence, Pilot Sohryu; a part of my awareness is still at home in the Imperial Residence, overseeing housekeeping, while the rest of me gets to enjoy a gala ball with my friends and sovereign." He laughed gently. "And should you two be accepting commissions as Imperial Army officers tonight, you'll be addressing me as 'sir' in official circumstances and 'm'lord' in social ones. I may be inactive at the moment, but I am still far senior to a pair of brand new First Lieutenants of the Green."

若你坚持如此称呼的话。我并非皇族血脉，因为皇后并非我生母……从生物学上讲，她刚刚提醒了我。严格来说，我出生时甚至没有血液。我也并非私生子王子之一，因为我根本就没有母亲。我们这些由皇帝亲手创造的孩子被称为“血铸之子”。虽然严格意义上是王子和公主，但我们大多更喜欢通过自己努力赢得的头衔来标记我们的存在。我们之所以成为我们，是靠自己的双手，而非出生的偶然。我之所以成为白军高级元帅，是因为我有丰富的战斗经验和服务年限，而成为内阁秘书则是因为我擅长此职，且陛下们乐于让我担任此职。至于今晚我只是个司机？正如古老的行话所说，我们都在“皇权的愉悦”下服务。我喜欢有机会载着父亲的朋友们去参加派对。作为一台古老的构造智能，飞行员苏龙，我的部分意识仍在家中的皇室住所监督家务，而其余的我则可以与朋友和君主一起享受盛大的舞会。”他温和地笑了。 若你二人今晚接受帝国军官委任，在正式场合须称我为“长官”，社交场合则称“大人”。我虽目前处于不活跃状态，但论资历仍远高于两位初出茅庐的绿军少尉。"

"You're going to have to explain the green and white thing," Asuka said. "Seniority system?"

"你得解释一下那个绿白相间的东西，" 明日香说，"是论资排辈的制度吗？"

Lord Verfico nodded. "Any officer rank in our services goes from Green to White, with Violet, Red, and Blue as intermediate grades. You'll be Green, the most junior. Stay in service a few years, and you'll be promoted to Violet, and so on."

维尔菲科勋爵点头道：“我们服务体系中的任何军官级别都从绿色到白色，紫色、红色和蓝色作为中间等级。你将是绿色，即最低级别。在服务中待上几年，你将被提升为紫色，以此类推。”

Shinji finally spoke up, a slightly puzzled look on his face. "A few years to go up one grade? How long does it take to get promoted to an actual higher rank?"

真嗣终于开口了，脸上带着些许困惑。“几年才能升一级？要晋升到真正的更高级别需要多久？”

"Mmm, a decade or two, if you're in a very active unit, or if you're a hot-shot hero like you two were. I've seen your records, you two would have made rank quickly given what your war was like."

嗯，如果你们在一个非常活跃的单位，或者像你们俩这样是炙手可热的英雄，大概需要十年或二十年。我看过你们的档案，考虑到你们所经历的战争，你们俩本可以迅速晋升。

Shinji blinked. "A decade or two? But… that's… How old are you?"

真嗣眨了眨眼。“一、二十年？但是……那……你多大了？”

Asuka interrupted before Lord Verfico could answer. "Don't ask, Third. You don't want to know."

明日香在维菲科大人回答之前打断了他。“别问了，老三。你不会想知道的。”

"Uh…" "呃…"

Lord Verfico smiled. "'Old enough to know better' is the joke my father always gives when the exact answer would cause confusion. But to answer the question behind your question, young sir, we live a long time in the Empire. You enlist for five hundred years to earn your Citizenship, and a few decades from time to time to maintain it. Thus, years between promotions is not a big problem. You two would be granted yours on request if you desired, as you've both already literally given your lives to save your world. And you both have volunteered to go back to save it again and rebuild it. You have my admiration and thanks."

维尔菲科勋爵微笑道：“‘老到该懂事了’是我父亲常开的玩笑，当确切答案会引起混淆时，他就会这么说。但为了回答你问题背后的问题，年轻的先生，在帝国，我们的寿命很长。你需服役五百年以获得公民身份，偶尔再花几十年时间来维持它。因此，晋升之间相隔的岁月并不是什么大问题。如果你们愿意，只要提出请求，你们二位就能获得晋升，因为你们已经实实在在地为拯救自己的世界献出了生命。而且你们都自愿回去再次拯救它，并重建它。我对此表示钦佩和感谢。”

"Ah, your thanks?" Shinji asked.

"啊，你的感谢呢？" 真嗣问道。

"It's a big infinity out there, Pilot Ikari. Avalon never turns down allies in the fight for all that is right; we need all the friends we can find."

外面的世界广阔无垠，碇真嗣驾驶员。阿瓦隆从不拒绝为正义而战的盟友；我们需要尽可能多的朋友。

"Um… you're welcome," Shinji mumbled.

"呃……不客气，" 真嗣嘟囔道。

Asuka rolled her eyes. 'Okay, so the old Third Child isn't totally gone. We'll have to work on that. Push back, baka-Shinji. I will not stand for you being a wimp. Not anymore. If you're going to be the one by my side in every fight from here until I release you, you're damn well going to be more than the wuss who turns into mush when someone thanks you. 'The Great, Invincible Shinji-sama' may have been almost as big a joke as you were, but I'm going to make it real. I won't have anything less by my side. You've always been a good Pilot, Shinji. I'm going to make you into a hero.'

明日香翻了个白眼。'好吧，看来旧时的第三适格者还没完全消失。我们得在这方面下功夫。反击吧，笨蛋真嗣。我可不会再容忍你当个懦夫。从今往后，如果每次战斗你都要站在我身边，那你绝不能只是那个别人一感谢就软成一滩泥的家伙。'伟大的、无敌的真嗣大人'或许曾和你一样是个笑话，但我会让它成真。我身边不容许有任何逊色。你一直是个出色的驾驶员，真嗣。我会把你打造成一个英雄。'

A faint glow appeared on the horizon in the forward viewscreen. "Fort Schelbert," Lord Verfico said. "We'll be there in a few moments. Ready to make your big entrance, Pilots?"

前方视窗的地平线上出现了一抹微光。“舍尔伯特堡，”维菲科勋爵说道，“我们马上就到。准备好惊艳登场了吗，飞行员们？”

Asuka stood up. The glow was rapidly growing into a huge fortress complex below them. She noticed Shinji's right hand doing his nervous rhythmic-clench thing. 'At least he's treating this as a battle. Better your combat persona than a doormat tonight, Third. I plan to show you off.' The dropship flared into a vertical landing after what would have been a dizzyingly swift and sharp dive towards the landing pad outside the lit-up great hall at the center of the base if Asuka hadn't already seen stranger things like yesterday's transit disc in action. The ramp at the back of the dropship silently lowered to reveal they were already lined up with a red carpet leading right to the large double doors.

明日香站起身来。下方，光芒迅速扩展成一座庞大的堡垒综合体。她注意到真嗣的右手正做着紧张的节奏性握拳动作。‘至少他把这当作一场战斗。今晚宁可是战斗姿态，也别当个受气包，第三适格者。我打算让你大放异彩。’飞船在垂直降落时猛地展开，若非明日香已见识过如昨日传送圆盘般的奇异景象，那向着基地中心灯火辉煌的大厅外停机坪的急速陡峭俯冲定会令人晕眩。飞船后部的坡道悄然放下，显露出一条红毯，笔直通向那扇巨大的双开门。

Asuka took Shinji's hand to stop the clenching. "Showtime," she said quietly. "Let's go, Shinji."

明日香握住真嗣的手，阻止了他的紧握。“好戏开场了，”她轻声说道，“我们走吧，真嗣。”

He just nodded and fell into step with her. When they reached the foot of the ramp, Lord Verfico was waiting for them. Asuka blinked and looked behind her. The dropship was empty. How…?

他只是点了点头，便与她并肩而行。当他们走到坡道底部时，维尔菲科勋爵正在那里等候。明日香眨了眨眼，回头望去。登陆艇空无一人。怎么……？

"Side door, and I move quickly," Lord Verfico smiled when she turned her head back to him. "Follow me. Officially, since you are still technically civilians right now, you're attending as my guests, and I'm here as an Imperial Army officer. Oh, just a moment, Pilot Ikari," He reached out to touch Shinji's ribbons and hooked his finger behind them. He pressed a tiny dot on the back of the rack and Shinji's uniform changed; the gold and black trim grew bigger and more elaborate, and the ribbons expanded into full medals. "There's a button on the back of the rack for swapping between simple and full formal dress modes, Pilot Ikari. Handy, no?" He stepped off down the carpet, the Pilots in tow, sweeping past a mass of people in formal wear and uniforms flanking the red carpet who eagerly peered at the new arrivals. Asuka noted with slight amusement the same red-carpet standard of flickering camera flashes could be found on Avalon as on Earth.

"侧门，我动作要快。" 当她回头看向他时，维尔菲科勋爵微笑着说。"跟我来。正式来说，既然你们目前还是平民身份，你们是以我的宾客身份出席，而我则是以帝国军官的身份到场。哦，稍等一下，碇真嗣驾驶员，" 他伸手触碰了真嗣的绶带，用手指勾住它们。他在绶带架背面轻按一个小点，真嗣的制服随即变化；金色与黑色的装饰变得更加宽大且繁复，绶带也扩展成了完整的勋章。"绶带架背面有个按钮，可以切换简单和全套正式礼服模式，碇真嗣驾驶员，很方便吧？" 他沿着地毯大步前行，驾驶员们紧随其后，穿过一群身着正装和制服、簇拥在红毯两侧的人群，这些人热切地打量着新来者。明日香略带戏谑地注意到，阿瓦隆上的红毯标准与地球无异，同样伴随着闪烁的相机闪光灯。

Lord Verfico handed a tiny card to the Colour-Sergeant at the door to the ballroom, and waited. The sergeant stepped inside and to one side of the doors and announced them to the moderate crowd of uniforms, gowns, and more exotic finery within. "Senior Marshal of the White His Imperial Highness Blood-Forged Prince Lord Sir Lucas Verfico nó O'Brien, and the Division Guests of Honor, Evangelion Pilots Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu!" A good part of the crowd turned to watch and applaud as they walked through the door.

维尔菲科勋爵向宴会厅门口的军旗中士递上一张小卡片，静候着。中士步入厅内，侧身于门旁，向厅内身着制服、礼服及更为奇异华服的中等规模人群宣告：“白袍高级元帅，帝国血铸王子，尊贵的卢卡斯·维尔菲科·诺·奥布莱恩爵士，以及荣誉嘉宾分部，福音战士真嗣·碇与明日香·兰格雷·索尔修！”随着他们步入厅堂，不少人转头注目并报以掌声。

"And Certified School Crossing Guard, thank you very much!" muttered Lord Verfico as they entered.

"还有认证的学校路口护导员，非常感谢！" 维菲科勋爵嘟囔着走进去。

"I thought you were here as an Army officer?" Asuka muttered back.

"我以为你是以军官身份来这里的？" 明日香低声回道。

"I am, but since Their Majesties are going to be attending too, they're required to announce at least some of my civil titles as well. I held out for just the top couple. At my age, the titles can pile up. Have you ever seen Their Majesties hit someone with their full array? Father loves that joke."

我确实如此，但由于陛下们也将出席，他们必须至少宣布我的一些民事头衔。我坚持只提最顶级的几个。在我这个年纪，头衔可以堆积如山。你见过陛下们用全副头衔来压人吗？父亲最爱这个玩笑了。

"I think they did it to another copy of the Third Child and I yesterday. Poor dummy looked like he was going to pass out," Asuka said, looking around at the cavernous hall. The dance floor had to be the size of a half dozen Olympic swimming pools put together. She could feel Shinji's tight grip on her hand. He'd never liked big crowds of people except as a place to disappear into. "Where are we supposed to sit?"

"我觉得他们昨天又对另一个第三适格者和我们做了同样的事。可怜的傀儡看起来快要晕过去了，"明日香说着，环顾着这巨大的大厅。舞池的面积得有六七个奥运会游泳池那么大。她能感觉到真嗣紧握着她的手。他除了作为消失其中的场所外，从不喜爱人群。"我们该坐哪儿呢？"

He nodded towards a set of large tables on a small stage at the far side of the dance floor. "You'll be up at the high table with Their Majesties and I, but for now, it's just mingle and chat time. Part of the reason you're here tonight is to get a chance to meet the officers of the 791st command staff and subordinate units before things kick off tomorrow." He gestured ahead of them at a cluster of people gathered around someone or something too short to see from outside the circle. "Such as her."

他朝舞池远端小舞台上的几张大桌子点了点头。“你将和陛下们以及我一起在高桌上就座，但现在，只是交际聊天的时间。今晚你来这里的目的之一，就是有机会在明天活动开始前，与 791 指挥部的军官及其下属单位的人员见面。”他指向前方，一群人围着某个太矮以至于从圈外看不见的人或物。“比如她。”

The circle parted enough for the two Pilots to see the focus point of the group was a short, petite red-headed woman with a chest full of a ridiculous array of medals, including a Wounded Lion around her neck like Asuka's, save that hers had three small diamonds under the lion's belly. She was finishing off some speech to her assembled listeners with a schoolgirlish giggle that was somehow oddly frightening coming from her.

人群稍稍散开，让两位飞行员得以看清焦点所在——一位娇小玲珑的红发女子，胸前挂满了琳琅满目的勋章，其中包括一条与明日香相似的“受伤狮子”勋章，只是她的那枚在狮子腹部下方镶有三颗小钻石。她正以一种学童般的咯咯笑声结束对众人的演讲，这笑声出自她口，竟莫名透着几分令人心悸的气息。

"That is Senior Colonel of the White Dame Moira Dufault, Baroness Waltham, commander of the 791st's lead infantry unit, the 2873rd Heavy Infantry Regiment. She'll be your primary heavy power armor unit commander. Amazingly fierce woman. Some people say battle-crazy, after she killed a krogan that irritated her, but I think she's just… flamboyant. An old friend of Their Majesties."

那是白女士莫拉·杜福奥特高级上校，沃尔瑟姆男爵夫人，791 部队先锋步兵单位 2873 重型步兵团的指挥官。她将是您主要的重型动力装甲单位指挥官。一位极其勇猛的女性。有人说她战斗狂热，自从她杀死了一个激怒她的克洛根人之后，但我认为她只是……张扬。陛下的老朋友。

"What's a krogan?" Shinji said.

"克洛根是什么？" 真嗣问道。

"About five hundred pounds of muscle, armor, and bloodlust. Warrior species from a rather interesting worldline we've run into in the last millennium. They have three spines, redundant organs, et cetera. She got the 'battle-crazy' reputation after she killed it with her teeth."

约五百磅的肌肉、盔甲与嗜血欲望。这是我们在过去千年间偶遇的一个颇为有趣的世界线上的战士种族。他们拥有三根脊椎，器官冗余等特征。她因用牙齿杀死对手而赢得了“战斗狂人”的名声。

"Her teeth? Was she handcuffed or something?" Shinji asked in disbelief.

"她的牙齿？她是被铐住了还是怎么的？" 真嗣难以置信地问道。

"No, just angry. He'd demanded a mighty human warrior for some honor challenge, and made disparaging remarks about her height when she showed up. She got upset. On the upside, between her and Commander Shepherd, krogans now consider red-haired human women to be incredibly deadly by default. They're very popular."

不，只是生气了。他要求一位强大的人类战士来应对某种荣誉挑战，而当她出现时，他却因她的身高而发表了贬低言论。她感到不快。不过，从好的方面看，在她和指挥官谢泼德之间，克洛根人现在认为红发人类女性默认就是极其致命的。她们非常受欢迎。

Shinji looked more confused than ever. "Why does your Empire have so many terrifying red-headed women running around?"

真嗣比以往任何时候都显得更加困惑。“为什么你的帝国里有这么多令人畏惧的红发女子四处奔走？”

"What's the matter, Third? I find that a perfectly sensible way to run a country. I approve," Asuka grinned. "Why does her Wounded Lion have the diamonds?"

"怎么了，老三？我觉得这是个非常合理的治国之道。我赞同，" 飞鸟咧嘴笑道，"为什么她的'受伤的狮子'会有钻石呢？"

"Multiple awards." 多项大奖。

Asuka stopped and looked at him. "How do you get multiple awards of a medal you get for dying in a last stand?"

明日香停下脚步，看着他。“你怎么能因为最后一次抵抗而牺牲获得多枚奖章呢？”

Lord Verfico gave her a half-smile. "The same way you did, miss; she got better. Death never keeps her for long. She's an old friend of the Lady, who will hardly let her spirit be lost."

维菲科勋爵对她露出一丝半笑。“就像你一样，小姐；她康复了。死亡从未长久留住她。她是女神的老朋友，女神几乎不会让她的灵魂迷失。”

"You people are really, really strange."

你们这些人真是太奇怪了。

### Chapter 22 Guests of Honor, Drinks & Dancing

asuka refused to let go of Shinji's hand for the next hour's parade of introductions. She told herself it was to force the terminally-averse-to-new-faces Third Child to man up and stand with her to get to know the startling array of Lieutenant Colonels, Colonels, Brigadiers they were introduced to. It had nothing to do with any impulse that decidedly did not like the idea of him being out of her sight. Better than half of them were visibly not Homo Sapiens. A few weren't even humanoid. All spoke perfectly good Japanese to them, even the Major that was a one hundred fifty centimeter tall insect. Asuka and Shinji shared a very confused look after shaking…hands... with that one.

在接下来的一小时里，阿苏卡拒绝放开真嗣的手，两人一同经历了接连不断的介绍。她告诉自己，这是为了让极度抗拒新面孔的第三适格者鼓起勇气，与她并肩站在一起，去认识那些令人震惊的陆军中校、上校和准将们。这与她内心深处不愿让他离开视线的冲动毫无关系。超过半数的人明显不是智人，甚至有几位连人形都不是。尽管如此，所有人都用流利的日语与他们交谈，就连那位身高仅一百五十厘米的昆虫型少校也不例外。与那位少校握手后，阿苏卡和真嗣交换了一个极其困惑的眼神。

Even the mildly familiar was strange. They were approached by a slightly tired looking woman who was an exact twin of Rayana, but had shorter hair, and was wearing a more formal rendition of Mother Sriyana's priestess robes with more white and pale green, and some green and gold knotted braid loops at the right shoulder. Lord Verfico introduced her to them as Predes Anna Shimegami Henderson. She greeted them in good German, but Asuka could hear a distinct British accent in it.

即便略显熟悉的事物也透着陌生。一位略显疲惫的女性向他们走来，她与雷亚娜如出一辙，只是头发更短，身着一套更为正式的祭司袍，以白色和淡绿色为主，右肩上点缀着绿色与金色的编织绳结。维尔菲科大人向他们介绍，这位是普雷德斯·安娜·希梅加米·亨德森。她用流利的德语向他们问好，但明日香能听出其中明显的英式口音。

She quickly cleared up their initial confusion, but introduced some more. "No, I'm not Rayana. I'm her analogue from a world where her life substantially diverged from the one that produced her." She tapped a finger on a gruesome scar on her neck just under her left ear. "The Empress never had to have a bout of lycanthropy, or get shot by a silver bullet, for example. I took it as a learning experience; a reminder to bloody duck. You can't heal other people when you're too busy healing yourself. I work at her Centre for Covert Multi-Dimensional Operations." She gave them an approving look. "So you're the pair that my other self has been talking about so much the last few days. You two look to be doing well together."

她迅速澄清了他们最初的困惑，却又引入了新的疑问。“不，我不是蕾雅娜。我是来自一个平行世界的她的对应体，在那里，她的生活与原本的世界产生了重大分歧。”她用手指轻敲着左耳下方一道骇人的疤痕，“比如，女皇从未经历过狼人症发作，或是被银弹击中。我将其视为一次学习经历；一个血淋淋的教训，提醒我要及时躲避。当你忙于自我疗愈时，就无法治愈他人。我在她的秘密多维行动中心工作。”她赞赏地看了他们一眼，“看来你们就是我的另一个自我最近几天频繁提及的那对搭档。你们俩看起来合作得不错。”

"You're in the Army too? A Chaplain?" Asuka asked. 'And what the fuck was that about lycanthropy? These people are weird!'

"你也在军队？还是个牧师？" 明日香问道。"还有，那什么狼人症是怎么回事？这些人真奇怪！"

Predes Anna shook her head. "Healer Adept. Magical and medical specialization. I'll be with the medical sections. I'm doing a decade to keep my Citizenship current. It's my first chance to get away from having to deal with the Centre's operatives and that lunatic Sam in two hundred years.

普雷德斯·安娜摇了摇头。“治疗师精通者，魔法与医学双重专长。我将加入医疗部门。我得服役十年以保持公民身份的有效性。这是我两百年来第一次有机会摆脱中心特工和那个疯子山姆的纠缠。”

You both seem like nice kids, but I'd just as soon not have to see you professionally if possible. No offense, but an 'easy' campaign like this is supposed to be my vacation. And now I get to spend my 'vacation' with you, or in the same operational area."

你们俩看起来都是好孩子，但如果可能的话，我宁愿不以专业身份见到你们。无意冒犯，但像这样“轻松”的任务本该是我的假期。现在，我却要和你们一起，或者在同一个行动区域度过我的“假期”。

"Going with an army to invade South America and rebuild our world is a 'vacation'?"

率领军队入侵南美，重建我们的世界，这算是“度假”吗？

Anna pointed to a couple more people in the crowd with Wounded Lions around their necks. "See the medal a few of them have, a seven-pointed star imperfectly surrounded by three ellipses? That's the Joint Service Medal – Centre. When the Centre needs heavy help in the guns and boots department, they call the Imperial Army. We don't call unless things are bad. Too many blokes earn their Lion with us. This operation of yours looks to be a tad simpler than some of our nasty ones. A relatively simple stabilize and rebuild campaign like this will be hopefully much calmer. I've seen too many bad ones in my seventy millennia. Give my best to the Empress when you see her next." She held her palm up to them, quietly blessed them in the name of the Lady as Lover, and left them.

安娜指向人群中脖子上挂着“受伤的狮子”勋章的几个人。“看到他们中有些人佩戴的勋章了吗？那是一颗七角星，周围环绕着三个不规则的椭圆。那是联合服务勋章——中心。当中心在火力和人力方面需要大力支援时，他们会召唤帝国军队。除非情况严重，否则我们不会轻易求援。太多人通过我们获得了狮子勋章。你这次的行动看起来比我们的一些棘手任务要简单一些。像这样相对简单的稳定和重建战役，希望会平静得多。在我这七万年里，我见过太多糟糕的情况了。下次见到女皇时，请代我向她问好。”她向他们举起手掌，以女神之爱之名默默祝福他们，然后离开了。

As the priestess walked away from them, Shinji spoke up. "Asuka, I want to ask you a question."

当女祭司离开他们时，真嗣开口了。“明日香，我想问你一个问题。”

Asuka looked at him out of the corner of her eye. "So spit it out, Third."

明日香斜眼瞥了他一眼，“那就直说吧，老三。”

He hesitated. "Well, you said I didn't want to know."

他犹豫了一下。“嗯，你说过我不想知道。”

'Oh, that. Well, better now than some comically awkward future moment.' "Try not to freak out." Asuka took a deep breath. "Ching told me yesterday that she was envious of me, for meeting you when we were so young. She said she's 'waited centuries' and not been lucky enough to have met anyone that…feels for her the way you do for me."

哦，那个啊。嗯，现在说总比将来某个尴尬得可笑的时刻说好。"尽量别慌。" 明日香深吸了一口气。"晶昨天告诉我，她很羡慕我，因为我们那么年轻就遇见了你。她说她'等了几个世纪'，却没那么幸运能遇到一个像你对我这样对她有感觉的人。"

Shinji stared at her. "Centuries? How old is she?"

真嗣盯着她。“几个世纪？她多大了？”

"Four hundred thirty-two." Shinji's eyes got wider. "She'll be four thirty-three in five months," Asuka added with morbid amusement.

"四百三十二。" 真嗣的眼睛瞪得更大了。"再过五个月，她就四百三十三了。" 明日香带着一种病态的幽默补充道。

"She's four hundred thirty-two and she's a Lieutenant?"

她四百三十二岁，还是个中尉？

"She did say she had a few decades of practice as a psychiatrist before she joined up. But see why they don't mind years between ranks?"

她确实说过，在加入之前，她作为精神科医生已有数十年的实践经验。但你看，为什么他们不在乎军衔间的年数差距呢？

Shinji rubbed his forehead. "And Lord Verfico is a Senior Marshal…how long would that take?" he asked weakly.

真嗣揉了揉额头。“而维菲科大人是一位高级元帅……那需要多长时间？”他无力地问道。

"A long damn time is my guess," Asuka said. She thought for a moment. "Given what Ching told me next about Daniel's age, I can make a fair guess as to Lord Verfico's."

"我猜是很长一段时间了，"飞鸟说。她想了一会儿。"鉴于青接下来告诉我的关于丹尼尔的年龄，我可以大致推测出维菲科领主的年龄。"

"Do I want to know?" Shinji sighed. "You did warn me. Alright, hit me."

"我想知道吗？" 真嗣叹了口气。"你确实提醒过我了。好吧，说吧。"

Asuka grinned, and punched him in the shoulder.

明日香咧嘴一笑，朝他肩膀上捶了一拳。

"Ow! Hey!" He rubbed at the injury.

"哎哟！嘿！" 他揉着受伤的地方。

"Oh, don't be a baby, Third." She grinned and gave him a quick kiss to remove the sting. "You just gave me a straight line, and I had to use it. It took your mind off the strangeness of their crazy long lives, didn't it? Alright, Lord Verfico is probably at least four hundred thousand years old, given that Ching said Daniel is 452,388 years old if my math is right, which of course it is."

“哦，别像个小孩子似的，老三。”她咧嘴一笑，迅速吻了他一下以消除刺痛。“你刚才给了我一个直截了当的回答，我当然得利用一下。这不就把你从他们那漫长到不可思议的生命带来的怪异感中拉回来了吗？好了，维菲科勋爵很可能至少有四十万岁，既然秦说丹尼尔如果我没算错的话是 452,388 岁，而我当然不会算错。”

"Gleep," was Shinji's insightful response. He stared into the distance without making further comment.

"格利普，"是真嗣的深刻回应。他凝视着远方，没有再发表任何评论。

"Ooh, they've got champagne," Asuka said as she snagged a flute off a passing waiter's tray. "You want any, Shinji?"

"哦，他们这里有香槟，" 明日香说着，从经过的服务员托盘上顺手拿了一杯。"你要来点吗，真嗣？"

"Guh." “呃。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. 'Well, this usually works in those old movies, and I've always wanted to try it.' She put down the champagne flute on a nearby table, grabbed Shinji by both sides of his head, then pulled his face down to hers and did her best to suck out his tonsils.

明日香翻了个白眼。“好吧，这在老电影里通常很管用，我一直想试试。”她将香槟杯放在旁边的桌上，双手抓住真嗣的脑袋两侧，然后用力将他的脸拉向自己，尽力去吸他的扁桃体。

A few seconds of that, and Shinji's hands came up behind her back to hold her to him. It was a good bit longer before Asuka slowly pulled back from the kiss. "Feel better now?" she asked.

经历了片刻的温存，真嗣的双手绕到她背后，将她紧紧拥入怀中。而明日香则过了好一会儿才缓缓从亲吻中抽离，她问道：“现在感觉好些了吗？”

"If I say no, do I get another one?" Shinji asked with a small smile.

"如果我说不，能再给我一个吗？" 真嗣带着一丝微笑问道。

Asuka was still debating whether to reward him for having the guts to ask or chastise him for pushing his luck when her response was cut off by a polite cough behind her.

明日香还在犹豫是该因为他有勇气提出而奖励他，还是因为他得寸进尺而责备他时，一声礼貌的咳嗽打断了她的回应。

Asuka turned to give the speaker, an Imperial Army Captain, a mild glare. He was probably apologetic, but his blue, plated face made it hard to tell.

明日香转头向那位帝国陆军上尉投去一个温和的瞪视。他或许是在道歉，但他那蓝色铠甲覆盖的面庞让人难以分辨。

"Pardon me, Pilots. Didn't mean to interrupt you. I'm sorry to bother you in the middle of a happy moment. I wanted to introduce myself before tomorrow morning. I'm Junior Captain of the Red John Farthe-M'tenga. I command the 17th Division Headquarters Support Company, and I'll be your company commander for this campaign. You'll fall under my company for chain of command and administration purposes, and to support you and your friends' mecha. We're attached to Division HQ, so you'll have easy access to the Division Commander for operational guidance and such." He indicated the ordinary looking human in uniform behind him. "Senior Sergeant First Class Bir will meet you tomorrow at the base site and be your base crew platoon sergeant. His crew will take care of your mecha and keep you in touch with the rest of the unit."

抱歉打扰了，飞行员们。无意打断你们。在你们欢乐的时刻打扰，实在不好意思。我想在明早之前自我介绍一下。我是红约翰·法瑟-门加的少尉队长，负责指挥第 17 师总部支援连，本次战役中我将担任你们的连长。你们将归入我的连队，以便于指挥和行政管理，同时支持你们及朋友们的机甲。我们隶属于师部，因此你们可以轻松接触到师指挥官，获取作战指导等。他指了指身后那位穿着制服的普通人类。“一等军士长比尔明天将在基地与你们会面，担任你们的基地班组军士长。他的团队将负责维护你们的机甲，并保持你们与部队的联系。”

The tall man with the red crew-cut nodded politely to them. "A pleasure to meet you, Pilots. We'll be ready to meet you as soon as you come through tomorrow morning."

那位留着红色平头的魁梧男子礼貌地向他们点头致意。“很荣幸见到各位飞行员。明天早上你们一到，我们就会准备好迎接。”

The Captain spoke up again. "Apologies for the interruption. We'll see you in the morning, Pilots." They both gave a half-bow and left.

船长再次开口：“抱歉打断一下。我们明早见，飞行员们。”两人微微鞠躬后便离开了。

"That…that guy was blue," Shinji said.

“那…那家伙是蓝色的，”真嗣说道。

"Yes, yes he was, Third. Still less weird than the one that was a giant insect.'

是的，他确实是，第三位。仍然没有那个变成巨型昆虫的那么怪异。

A hand tapped Asuka on the shoulder. "Hey, I've got wings. Don't I get a little weirdness badge too?"

一只手轻拍了拍明日香的肩膀。“嘿，我有翅膀。我是不是也该得到一个怪异徽章呢？”

Asuka spun around. "Ching!"

明日香转身道：“叮！”

The StarStrider pilot sparkled in her space-black Navy dress uniform with its own impressive set of medals as she gave her friend a hug. "Wow, I leave for a few hours, and you go wild! Look at you! You look like a million bucks!" She stepped back and gave Shinji a wicked smirk. "And you look pretty happy too, Shinji. You two have an evening as good as your morning, mmm?"

星际航行者号的飞行员身着带有耀眼勋章的海军黑色制服，光彩照人，她给朋友一个拥抱，说道：“哇，我才离开几个小时，你就放飞自我了！看看你！看起来价值百万啊！”她后退一步，对真嗣露出一抹狡黠的微笑，“而且你也看起来很开心嘛，真嗣。你们俩的晚上和早上一样美好，嗯？”

Shinji blinked at her for a second, then went bright red. Ching laughed. "He's just so cute, Asuka! What did you do to him?"

真嗣愣愣地看了她一秒，随即满脸通红。青笑了起来。“他真是太可爱了，明日香！你对他做了什么？”

Asuka was less red than Shinji was at least. She hoped so, anyhow. "We did have a good evening, yes. He, ahem, washed my back, since he didn't get the chance this morning."

至少明日香的脸没有真嗣那么红。她希望如此。“我们确实度过了一个愉快的夜晚，是的。他，呃，帮我洗了背，因为早上没机会。”

Ching's grin got even bigger. "I think I'll withhold my high-fiving you and getting any further into the details until it looks less like Shinji's going to have a meltdown." She nodded at the retreating backs of the two departing soldiers. "Who were the two that had you marveling at that guy's blueness?"

青的笑容更加灿烂了。“我想我还是先不和你击掌庆祝，也不深入了解细节了，免得真嗣看起来快要崩溃。”她朝那两个离去的士兵背影点了点头。“让你惊叹那人蓝得惊人的那两位是谁？”

"The commander for our assigned support company and the sergeant who's going to be our base crew, they said," Asuka replied. She squeezed Shinji's hand to try to help him recover from the blush.

"我们分配到的支援部队的指挥官和即将成为我们基地班组长的中士，他们说的，"明日香回答道。她紧握着真嗣的手，试图帮他从脸红中恢复过来。

"Really? Hmm, I guess that means I'll see them again tomorrow. Good. The tall one has a really nice backside. I'd like to see more of it."

"真的吗？嗯，那看来我明天又能见到他们了。太好了。那个高个子的背影真不错。我还想多看几眼。"

"You just have a dirty mind, Ching."

你只是心术不正，青。

Ching gave her a mock-pout. "Hey, I'm the one who's single right now. I get to look. Besides, it's a plain crime not to look at prime beefcake like that. Woof!"

青对她做了个假装的撅嘴表情。“嘿，我现在可是单身。我有权利看。再说了，面对那样的极品鲜肉还不看，简直是罪过。汪！”

"Prime beefcake? Where?" Misato eagerly looked around as she joined them. She then leapt a good six inches in the air as her fiancé pinched her.

"顶级肌肉男？在哪？" 碇真嗣急切地四处张望，加入他们后。随即，她被未婚夫捏了一下，惊得跳起足有六英寸高。

"Right behind you, Misato. You're not as single anymore, remember?" Ryoji Kaji teased her. "But if you still want to window shop, that's okay."

"就在你后面，美里。你现在可不再是单身了，记得吗？" 渚薰调侃她道，"不过如果你想继续逛逛橱窗，那也没问题。"

Misato looked surprised. "Really?"

葛城美里显得很惊讶。“真的吗？”

Kaji shrugged. "Sure." 加治耸了耸肩。“当然。”

"Ooh, my boy is too nice! Point me towards the beef-"

哦，我的孩子太善良了！指给我看那牛肉——

"I'll be right over here talking to that stunning blonde with the big-"

我就在这儿和那位惊艳的金发美女聊着，她有着大大的——

Misato spun right back around and latched onto Kaji's arm. "On second thought, I think we should keep our eyes on who were talking to at the table. Oh, hello, Horaki-chan, Suzuhara-kun!"

碇真嗣立刻又转过身来，紧紧抓住加持的手臂。“转念一想，我觉得我们应该留意一下我们桌上的谈话对象。哦，你好，洞木同学，铃原同学！”

The Eva Pilots' former classmates joined the group. Asuka blinked in surprise. Suzuhara was wearing a dark green Imperial Army cadet's uniform just like Shinji, but had just a single row of three ribbons on his. 'A Purple Heart, 2015 Angel War Campaign ribbon, and the Eva Pilot's Badge. Well, I guess he gets all three from his one technical mission,' Asuka noted. But it was her friend Hikari who was the stunner. Her habitual pig-tails and student uniform look was gone, replaced with an elegant black cheongsam with a dragon coiled around her body picked out in silver embroidery, and her hair was now styled into a slightly longer than shoulder length cut with a fringe above her eyes, set off by thin lighter brown highlights throughout. "Wow, Hikari. You look good. And Suzuhara almost looks like a civilized person worthy of hanging out with you, instead of an overgrown monkey in a track suit."

前同窗们加入了队伍，明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼。铃原穿着与真嗣相同的深绿色帝国陆军学员制服，但胸前仅有一排三枚勋章：紫心勋章、2015 年天使战争战役勋带以及 EVA 驾驶员徽章。“看来他仅凭一次技术任务就获得了这三项荣誉，”明日香心想。然而，真正令人惊艳的是她的好友光。她一贯的马尾辫和学生制服形象已不复存在，取而代之的是一件优雅的黑色旗袍，上面银线绣着一条盘绕全身的龙，头发也剪成了略长于肩膀的长度，刘海轻覆额前，发间点缀着淡淡的浅棕色挑染。“哇，光，你看起来真美。而铃原也几乎像个能与你相配的文明人，不再是那个穿着运动服的大猴子了。”

Suzuhara ignored the barbs from Asuka save for a dirty look and focused on his friend. "Yo, Shinji. Lookin' pretty good in the uniform too, huh? You seen Kensuke yet?"

铃原无视了明日香的嘲讽，只是回以一个不悦的眼神，然后转向他的朋友。“哟，真嗣。穿上制服也挺帅的嘛，你见到剑介了吗？”

"Come to think of it, no," Shinji said. He looked to Ching. "Did you see him anywhere?"

“这么一想，确实没有，”真嗣说道。他看向青。“你在哪儿见过他吗？”

She nodded. "Yes, about five minutes ago he was um…'geeking out' when we ran into some officers from one of the Black Knight regiments. When he found out they were all combat veterans piloting the same mecha he was going to get, he kind of went nuts and started bugging them with questions." Ching snorted. "If he thinks a Black Knight is hot stuff, he's going to shit himself when he sees your new ride, Asuka."

她点头道：“是的，大约五分钟前，我们偶遇了一些黑骑士团的军官，他就开始……‘兴奋不已’。得知他们都是驾驶着他即将拥有的同款机甲的战斗老兵后，他就有点失控了，不停地向他们提问。”青哼了一声，“如果他认为黑骑士很了不起，那他看到你的新座驾时，怕是要惊掉下巴了，明日香。”

Asuka smiled, envisioning the looks of awe and shock on the military-otaku Stooge's face when she showed him what her mecha could do tomorrow. She was about to share her happy thought with Ching when Lord Verfico appeared at her elbow. "Please follow me, everyone. They're about to start seating everyone for the dinner, and it's time to make our way to the head table."

明日向军事宅斯图奇展示她的机甲实力时，他脸上那惊愕与震撼的表情，让明日香不禁微笑起来。她正想与青分享这份喜悦，维菲科勋爵却悄然出现在她身旁：“请大家随我来，晚宴即将开始安排座位，我们该前往主桌了。”

The group fell in behind him as they started to move towards the large table on the stage across the dance floor. Lord Verfico tapped Aida on the shoulder as they passed his circle and he fell in at the trail end of their group. The constant background noise of the crowd began to fade as the population of the ballroom spotted their party crossing the dance floor heading for the stage, and took that as the signal to begin heading to their own tables. Aware they were very much on public display, Asuka threaded her arm through Shinji's and threw her shoulders back. If people were watching, then she was going to strut. She saw Hikari do the same with Touji out of the corner of her eye, and heard an ironic snort from Ching as she was left to be paired with Aida. "Don't get any funny ideas, kid," she warned him, but allowed him to take her arm anyway.

众人跟随他向舞台上的大桌移动，穿过舞池。经过维尔菲科勋爵的圈子时，他轻拍了艾达的肩膀，随后加入到队伍末尾。随着宴会厅的人群注意到他们穿过舞池走向舞台，背景的嘈杂声逐渐减弱，人们开始向各自的桌子移动。意识到自己正被公众注视，明日香挽起真嗣的手臂，挺直了肩膀。既然有人在看，她就要昂首阔步。她眼角瞥见光也与冬二做着同样动作，而听到青一声讽刺的哼声，她被留下来与艾达配对。“别动歪脑筋，小子，”她警告道，但还是让他挽住了自己的手臂。

They mounted the stage and found name cards at each seat. Shinji and Asuka found themselves to the right of the seat marked for Daniel, but he was not in evidence, nor Rayana. Before they could sit, a tall man with Caucasian features but coal-black skin and canary yellow eyes shook their hands and introduced himself. "Good evening, Pilots, friends. I am Major General of the Red Sir Connor O'Farrell nó O'Brien, the 791st Division Commander. This is my senior wife, Lady Daria de Beckwith." He indicated the slender brunette standing behind the seat next to his, who gave them a smile and a wave. "I look forward to a smooth, if challenging, operation for us. I don't think we've ever attempted a continental-scale Nobody Dies scenario. Ought to be interesting in the attempt, at least."

他们登上舞台，发现每个座位上都放着名牌。真嗣和明日香发现自己位于标记着丹尼尔名字的座位右侧，但丹尼尔和瑞亚娜均未现身。在他们坐下之前，一位高大的男子，拥有高加索人的面部特征，但皮肤如煤炭般漆黑，眼睛呈鲜黄色，与他们握手并自我介绍：“晚上好，驾驶员们，朋友们。我是红衣少将康纳·奥法雷尔·诺·奥布赖恩，第 791 师指挥官。这位是我的高级妻子，贝克维思夫人达莉亚。”他指向站在他旁边座位后方的苗条棕发女子，她向他们微笑并挥手致意。“我期待我们能顺利，尽管充满挑战的行动。我想我们从未尝试过大陆规模的‘无人死亡’情景。至少在尝试中应该会很有趣。”

Asuka found herself at a loss for words. The pure ink-black skin and yellow eyes of the man was the final straw of weirdness for the night. She and Shinji mechanically shook his hand and just stared.

明日香发现自己无言以对。那人纯黑的肌肤和黄色的眼睛，成了这个夜晚怪异之极的最后一根稻草。她和真嗣机械地握了握手，只是呆呆地望着。

"What, have I got something in my hair?" he asked after a moment's awkward pause.

"怎么，我头发上有东西吗？"他尴尬地停顿了一会儿后问道。

"I think they're hitting their strangeness saturation for the evening, dear. They are from a rather baseline Earth, after all. I doubt they've seen anyone like you before," Lady Daria commented.

“亲爱的，我想他们今晚的奇异感已经饱和了。毕竟他们来自一个相当普通的地球。我怀疑他们以前从未见过像你这样的人，”达莉亚夫人评论道。

"What, your world doesn't have any dragons? How boring!" he exclaimed.

"什么，你们的世界没有龙？真无聊！"他惊呼道。

"You're….a dragon?" Asuka was starting to get the same stunned look that Touji, Hikari, and most of the others had.

"你……是龙？" 明日香也开始露出和东治、光以及大多数人一样的震惊表情。

Sir Connor quirked his lips. "No, I'm a platypus that's really good at shapeshifting," he said dryly. "Of course I'm a dragon. Black skin, yellow eyes, dragon-shaped aura? I'm shapeshifted down to human form because my natural body would take up most of the dance floor, and I'd look silly trying to fit into my dress uniform."

康纳爵士撇了撇嘴：“不，我是一只擅长变形的鸭嘴兽。”他干巴巴地说，“我当然是龙。黑皮肤，黄眼睛，龙形气场？我现在变成人形是因为我的自然形态会占据大部分舞池，而且穿着礼服制服会显得很滑稽。”

Shinji started to pull out Asuka's chair for her, but a headshake from Lord Verfico stopped him. "Don't take your seats just yet. You'll just have to get back up in a second if you do," he quietly told them.

真嗣正要为明日香拉开椅子，但维尔菲科勋爵的一个摇头动作阻止了他。“先别坐下，如果现在坐下，一会儿还得站起来。”他轻声对他们说道。

"Why?" Asuka asked, just before the first blast of brass instruments sounded.

"为什么？" 明日香问道，就在铜管乐器的第一声轰鸣响起之前。

"Because They are arriving," he nodded towards the main doors to the hall.

"因为他们要到了," 他朝大厅的主门点头示意。

"General and Lady O'Farrell, Ladies and Gentlemen; Their Majesties, the Emperor and Empress of Avalon!" a herald shouted from across the room. Accompanied by the triumphal notes of what Asuka guessed was their national anthem or such, the large double doors at the end of the hall swung wide, and Daniel and Rayana walked in.

"奥法雷尔将军与夫人，女士们、先生们；阿瓦隆的皇帝与皇后陛下驾到！"传令官在房间另一头高声宣布。伴随着阿苏卡猜测为国歌或类似曲目的凯旋旋律，大厅尽头那对巨大的双开门缓缓敞开，丹尼尔和雷亚娜步入其中。

Asuka shook her head for a second. No, her odd hosts and new friends Daniel and Rayana didn't walk in, the Emperor and Empress did. Their eclectic array of outfits from the last few days had been replaced by two circlets of silvery metal and gems on their brows, and opposite, complimentary sets of armor on their bodies; His silver and black, Hers black and silver. They even felt different to look at; their hosts' casual, welcoming expressions were likewise replaced by cool, imperious masks and an aura of authority. For the first time, Asuka was really conscious that her hosts were also Heads of State. Who'd offered her and Shinji a blank check of total support, come to think of it. ''An Army at your back, and gods on your side', I told myself. I should have asked for a pony while I was at it.'

明日香摇了摇头，片刻间意识到，并非她那奇特的主人和新朋友丹尼尔与雷安娜走了进来，而是皇帝与皇后驾到。过去几天里他们那五花八门的服饰已被两顶镶嵌着银色金属与宝石的额冠所取代，两人身上则穿着相映成趣的盔甲套装；他的银黑相间，她的黑银搭配。就连看着他们，感觉也迥然不同；主人们原本随意亲切的表情，此刻已被冷漠威严的面具所替代，周身散发着权威的气息。这是明日香第一次真正意识到，她的主人同时也是国家的元首。回想起来，他们还曾向她和真嗣提供了一张无条件支持的空白支票。“背后有军队，身边有神明，”我暗自思忖，“当时真该顺便要匹小马的。”

Reaching the stage, the couple paused at the leading edge and turned to face the crowd. In unison, the crowd bowed to their sovereigns, as did the others on the stage around them. Asuka and her friends followed suit after a beat of confusion. They'd never had to consider that part before when their hosts had come in. The Emperor held out the Empress's chair for her, then seated himself.

抵达舞台后，这对夫妇在台前边缘停下脚步，转身面向人群。人群齐刷刷地向他们的君主鞠躬，舞台上其他人也如此。明日香和她的朋友们在一瞬间的困惑后，也跟着鞠躬。他们以前从未考虑过主人到来时需要这样做。皇帝为皇后拉开椅子，然后自己坐下。

"Take! Seats!" barked the Division Command Sergeant Major from the far side of their table. There was an extended rustle throughout the room as everyone sat down.

"坐下！"师部指挥军士长在桌子对面厉声命令。房间里随即响起一阵持续的窸窣声，所有人都坐了下来。

Sir Connor stood with his glass of wine in hand. "Ladies and Gentlemen…to the Lord and Lady!"

康纳爵士手持酒杯站立着，“女士们，先生们……敬领主与夫人！”

"To the Lord and Lady!" the crowd chorused.

"敬祝领主与夫人！"人群齐声合唱。

Dinner began. 晚宴开始了。

"That's pretty close to the exact truth, Shinji. Before I started travelling, I would have called myself a firm believer in physicalist monism, even a functionalist. But like you said, things like the Third Impact really put a whole new spin on the mind-body question. Empirical confirmation of the soul as an entity that is not necessarily tied to the body really changed the parameters of the debate on your world, didn't it?"

这几乎就是确切的事实，真嗣。在我开始旅行之前，我会自称为坚定的物理主义一元论者，甚至是功能主义者。但正如你所说，像第三次冲击这样的事件确实为心身问题带来了全新的视角。灵魂作为不一定与身体绑定的实体得到实证确认，确实改变了你所在世界对此辩论的参数，不是吗？

Shinji nodded in agreement to Daniel's question. After living through many of Asuka's tirades on the pitiful state of his mathematical knowledge or Doctor Akagi's old lectures on how Evangelions worked, he was quietly enjoying the experience of being the one without the blank look for a change. Misato and his former classmates were looking totally at sea. Kaji-san was keeping up by virtue of a few college philosophy courses. Asuka was much the same, bolstered by her formidable intelligence, though she had shot Shinji quite a look when their hosts had turned the dinner conversation to his field. But for once he was holding his own on an advanced topic, and his friends were struggling to keep up.

真嗣对丹尼尔的问题点头表示同意。经历了明日香对他数学知识贫乏的多次抨击，或是赤木博士关于使徒的旧讲座，他现在难得地享受着不再是茫然表情的角色。美里和昔日的同学们显得一头雾水。加持先生凭借几门大学哲学课程勉强跟上。明日香也差不多，她那卓越的才智让她不落下风，尽管当主人将晚餐话题转向真嗣的专业领域时，她曾向真嗣投去意味深长的一瞥。但这一次，他在一个高深话题上站稳了脚跟，而他的朋友们则在努力追赶。

"Confirmation of the existence of the soul certainly shook the philosophical and theological worlds. For me it certainly made war even more unpleasant than it had already been. When you know that any person you kill is a unique soul snuffed out, it becomes very hard to even contemplate fighting and killing," Shinji replied. He looked at Asuka. "That's why I hated the idea so much, Asuka. I couldn't ever get that out of my mind."

灵魂存在的证实无疑震撼了哲学和神学界。对我来说，这无疑让战争变得更加令人不快。当你知道你所杀的每一个人都是一个独一无二的灵魂被扼杀时，就连想象战斗和杀戮都变得异常艰难。" 真嗣回答道。他看着明日香，"这就是为什么我如此厌恶这个想法，明日香。我始终无法将它从脑海中抹去。

Asuka grimaced. "But like he said this morning, Shinji, sometimes refusing to do it is the worse option."

明日香皱了皱眉。“但就像他今早说的，真嗣，有时候拒绝去做反而是更糟的选择。”

"I know…I'll be glad when we don't have to be soldiers anymore. I'd rather just study and play music for you."

我知道……当我们不必再当士兵时，我会很高兴。我宁愿只是学习和为你演奏音乐。

Asuka smiled at that more gently than Shinji would have believed a week ago as she swirled the wine in her glass. "Maybe someday in the future, Shinji, but for now it's the season of the sword. Winthrop and Jinnai aren't the kind of people I want running the world that you, me, our families, or our friends will have to live in."

明日香对着酒杯中旋转的葡萄酒露出了比真嗣一周前所能想象的还要温柔的微笑。“也许将来有一天，真嗣，但现在仍是剑的季节。温索普和阵内不是那种我希望掌管我们、我们的家人和朋友将要生活的世界的人。”

"Hmm, as far as his distaste for killing, he sounds like he might be a good candidate for a course in Shield Theory, Sire," Sir Connor observed.

“嗯，就他对杀戮的厌恶而言，他听起来可能是盾理论课程的好人选，陛下，”康纳爵士评论道。

"Shield Theory?" Asuka asked.

"盾构理论？"明日香问道。

"Mmm, we don't exactly have anything like political parties here in the Empire, but we do have two broad philosophical schools that people subscribe to," Daniel said. "Sword and Shield; Sword followers are all about taking apart bad people, Shield followers about protecting the good. More a matter of approach, really. Shield Theory is a full practical and theoretical course that takes a few subjective years that…well… students learn multiple ways of defending against attacks on physical, mental, magical, and spiritual planes using deflection, shielding, wards, judo and aikido-style diversion techniques for physical and conversational confrontations, et cetera. Advanced students then move on to ways and theory on how to prevent opponents from attacking in the first place; temporal interrupts, quick mute spells, hypnotic blocks on attack initiation, direct physical induction blocks on key impulse neurons, pax effectors, and so on. Graduates are expected to have learned methods of operation in full-magic, low-magic, non-magic, full or non-psionic, or purely non-corporeal environments that make it almost impossible to for another entity to initiate any attack that can actually contact them. Think of it as a defensive martial art that also includes philosophical and mental approaches to the same end. If you have to fight, but don't like to kill, Shield Theory would be right up your alley, Shinji. I get the feeling Asuka might be more interested in the inverse course, Weapon Theory."

"嗯，我们帝国里并没有像政治党派那样的东西，但我们确实有两种广泛流行的哲学流派，人们会追随其中之一。" 丹尼尔说，"剑与盾；剑派追随者致力于拆解邪恶之人，而盾派追随者则专注于保护善良。这更多是方法论上的差异。盾理论是一门全面的实践与理论课程，需要数年时间来主观学习，学生们会掌握多种防御技巧，以应对来自物理、心理、魔法及精神层面的攻击，运用偏转、护盾、结界、柔道和合气道风格的转移技巧来处理身体和言语上的冲突等等。高阶学生随后会学习如何从一开始就阻止对手发起攻击的理论与方法；时间干扰、快速沉默咒语、攻击启动时的催眠阻断、直接对关键冲动神经的物理诱导阻断、和平效应器等等。" 毕业生应已掌握在全魔法、低魔法、无魔法、全或非灵能、以及纯粹非实体环境中操作的方法，这些环境几乎使其他实体无法发起能实际接触到他们的攻击。将其视为一种防御性武术，同时包含哲学和心理层面的应对策略。如果你必须战斗，却不喜欢杀戮，那么盾理论正合你意，真嗣。我感觉到明日香可能对相反的课程——武器理论更感兴趣。"

Asuka perked up. "That sounds like philosophy more my speed. Tell me more."

明日香顿时来了精神。“这听起来更像是我的哲学风格。多给我讲讲。”

Rayana took up her request. "Just like it sounds; the inverse course. You learn hundreds of different weapons and how to use them. Then you start learning the philosophy behind how, when, and why to do damage to your opponents. With the higher level stuff you start moving past needing actual material weapons to do the damage, and into direct energy and spatial manipulation. The goal is to make you realize that there is really only one weapon; Will. By definition, a Weapon Theory graduate cannot be disarmed."

蕾安娜接受了她的请求。“正如其名，逆向课程。你学习数百种不同的武器及其使用方法。随后，你开始学习关于何时、如何以及为何对对手造成伤害的哲学。到了高级阶段，你将超越依赖实体武器造成伤害的层次，进入直接操控能量和空间的领域。其目的是让你领悟到，真正的武器只有一个——意志。因此，武器理论的毕业生无法被解除武装。”

"Yeah, that is definitely more 'me'. Sign me up!" Asuka declared.

"对，这绝对更'我'。算我一个！" 明日香宣布道。

"Maybe later, Asuka. The course takes at a minimum a sidereal year, several years subjective time, most of it compressed in rapid-feed mental simulations and such. It's not something you're going to toss off between here and the beginning of your mission," Rayana said.

“或许晚些时候吧，明日香。这门课程至少需要一个恒星年，主观时间则是数年，大部分内容都压缩在快速反馈的思维模拟等环节中。这不是你在前往任务开始地点的路上就能轻易完成的，”雷亚娜说道。

"Speaking of the mission, if everyone's done with the meal, then it's about time to start the official part of tonight's program," Daniel put in. When everyone had nodded, he waved a hand towards Sir Connor. "Take it away, General."

提到任务，如果大家都用完餐了，那么今晚的正式环节也该开始了，”丹尼尔插话道。见众人点头，他向康纳爵士挥了挥手，“开始吧，将军。”

Sir Connor dipped his head and stood up. He began to speak in the same complex tongue they'd heard from Doctor Metelya during their visit to the clinic. Shinji looked at his friends who looked back with matching confusion. Rayana noticed their puzzlement and whispered a few words into the air. Suddenly Sir Connor's words were understandable Japanese. "-nd now, Your Majesties, Ladies and Gentlemen, comrades and guests, we are about to begin tonight's commissioning ceremony." He spoke at just a conversational volume level, but somehow his words reached the farthest corners of the vast hall, and an attentive silence quickly spread through the crowd. "Colonel Hus, the invocation, please."

康纳爵士低头起身，开始用他们曾在诊所拜访时从梅特利亚医生那里听到的复杂语言讲话。真嗣看向他的朋友们，他们回以同样困惑的表情。雷亚娜注意到他们的困惑，轻声对着空气说了几句。突然间，康纳爵士的话变成了可理解的日语：“-现在，陛下、女士们、先生们、同志们和嘉宾们，我们即将开始今晚的委任仪式。”他的声音仅维持在日常交谈的音量，但不知何故，他的话语传遍了宏伟大厅的每个角落，随之而来的是全场迅速蔓延的专注静默。“胡斯上校，请进行祈祷。”

At the next table over another officer stood up, his dark green uniform including complicated blue and white knotted braid loops at the right shoulder. His equally quiet words also were easily audible despite the distance. "Please bow your heads and pray with me."

邻桌的另一位军官站了起来，他深绿色的制服上，右肩处装饰着复杂蓝白相间的编织穗带。尽管距离不近，他同样低沉的话语却清晰可闻：“请低头与我一同祈祷。”

'Lord and Lady with us

与我们同在的领主与夫人

To watch over us 守护我们

And stand beside us 并肩而立

As we fight for the right,

当我们为正义而战，

Without question or pause

毫无疑问或停顿

Willing to march into Hell,

甘愿踏入地狱，

For a Heavenly cause 为了天国的使命

Be with us this hour

请在此刻与我们同在

From the first brightness of the sun

从太阳初升的第一缕光芒

To the last dying of the light

直至最后一抹光华消逝

Until the day we all rise up

直到我们共同奋起的那一天

So mote it be.' 心愿如此，必成现实。

"So mote it be," the crowd echoed softly. Colonel Hus sat down, and Sir Connor spoke again. "Tomorrow we will begin deploying to an Earth that has seen a lot of damage and cataclysmic events in the last twenty subjective years. In just the last month, there has been a coup against a brutal United Nations Secretary-General, a coup that largely succeeded thanks to the actions and choices of the two Evangelion Pilots that are here with us tonight as our Guests of Honor. Pilot Sohryu, Pilot Ikari, could you please rise and take a bow?"

"诚如所愿,"人群轻声回响。赫斯上校坐下，康纳爵士再次发言。"明日我们将开始部署到一个在过去二十年主观时间里遭受重创和灾难性事件的地球。仅在过去一个月内，就发生了一场针对残暴的联合国秘书长的政变，这场政变得以大体成功，多亏了今晚与我们同为贵宾的两位福音战士驾驶员的行动和选择。驾驶员惣流，驾驶员碇，请起立并鞠躬致意。"

Shinji stood up and managed a rather self-conscious bow. Asuka, he noted, stood almost regally and gave a curtsey that was far more pleasant to watch. The wave of applause still made him blush.

真嗣站起身，略显拘谨地鞠了一躬。他注意到，明日香几乎是以一种高贵的姿态站立着，行了一个远比他优雅的屈膝礼。那阵阵掌声仍让他脸颊泛红。

"These two veteran Pilots and their friends will be joining us as special advisors to the command staff and other capacities. Tomorrow we will ride out with them to begin the stabilization and rebuilding of their world. To that end, they have accepted six month appointments as Auxiliary Officers in the Imperial Army, at the rank of Junior First Lieutenants of the Green." He looked at the group of former NERV members and friends at the table. "Would those of you swearing in to accept your commissions tonight please rise and form a line at the front of the stage, please?"

这两位资深飞行员及其朋友们将作为特别顾问加入我们的指挥团队及其他职能部门。明日我们将与他们一同出发，开始他们世界的稳定与重建工作。为此，他们已接受为期六个月的帝国陆军辅助军官任命，担任绿带少尉军衔。他望向桌前的前 NERV 成员及朋友们，说道：“请今晚宣誓接受委任的各位起立，在前台排成一列，谢谢。”

Shinji and the others shuffled around the table to form a line as directed, facing the audience. "About! Face!" the Division CSM barked again. Asuka, Misato, and Kaji pivoted around smoothly, Shinji and the others more raggedly.

真嗣和其他人按照指示在桌子周围移动，排成一行面对观众。"转过来！面对！"分部军士长再次大声命令。明日香、美里和加持流畅地转身，而真嗣和其他人则显得有些笨拙。

Daniel was already standing in front of them when they had all turned, Rayana half a step behind him to the left. "Raise your right hands and repeat after me," he said calmly.

当他们全部转过身时，丹尼尔已经站在他们面前，雷亚娜在他左后方半步之遥。“举起你们的右手，跟着我重复，”他平静地说道。

Shinji raised his right hand. 'This is certainly a bit more formal than Misato-san handing me an ID card and Father yelling at me to 'get in the damn robot!''

真嗣举起了右手。“这确实比美里小姐递给我一张身份证，还有父亲冲我吼‘快给我进那该死的机器人！’要正式一些。”

Daniel began, halting every sentence or two to allow Shinji and the others to echo. "I, Shinji Ikari, do solemnly swear to serve, support, and defend the Crown of Avalon against all enemies for not less than six months; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter; and that I will obey the orders of the Crown and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Imperial Code of Military Justice. So help me..." Gott, Buddha, Lord, Kami, and Tek were cited from their group as the individual deities of choice.

丹尼尔开始宣读誓词，每说完一两句便停顿一下，让真嗣和其他人跟着复述：“我，碇真嗣，郑重宣誓，将效忠、支持并捍卫阿瓦隆王冠，对抗一切敌人，期限不少于六个月；我将忠诚于王冠，毫无保留地奉献我的信仰与忠诚；我自愿承担此义务，绝无任何心理保留或逃避之意图；我将恪尽职守，忠实履行即将就任的职责；我将遵从王冠的命令及上级军官的指令，依照规章及帝国军事法典行事。愿……”他们各自选择了神祇——上帝、佛陀、主、神明与泰克，作为誓言的见证。

That last one got Kensuke a funny look from Touji. "What? I liked that book," he muttered defensively.

最后一个问题让健介从透治那里得到了一个奇怪的眼神。“怎么了？我喜欢那本书，”他有些防备地嘟囔道。

"Congratulations, Lieutenants, and welcome to the service of the Crown," Daniel said more naturally. "Do remember to give a coin to the first enlisted member who salutes you. Now, as Guests of Honor, you may have the first dance."

"祝贺你们，中尉们，欢迎加入王室服务，"丹尼尔更自然地说道，"别忘了给第一个向你们敬礼的士兵一枚硬币。现在，作为贵宾，你们可以率先起舞。"

Shinji was mostly sure his legs were still there, since he hadn't fallen to the floor. But all of a sudden everything below his neck was completely numb. "Who? Us?" he squeaked.

真嗣多半确信自己的腿还在，毕竟他没倒在地上。但突然间，他颈下的一切都彻底失去了知觉。“谁？我们？”他尖声问道。

"Yes, you, Lieutenant Ikari," Daniel said. "This ball is in honor of the mission on your world we're about to start and you are the Guests of Honor, after all. If you're feeling a bit nervous, here." He produced a small tumbler from behind his back. "Drink this. There's a small Charm of Courage on it. It'll give you a little boost for a bit, get you over that first wave of nerves."

"是的，就是你，碇中尉，"丹尼尔说，"这场舞会是为了庆祝即将在你所在星球上开始的任务，而你们毕竟是贵宾。如果感到有些紧张，来。"他从背后拿出一个小酒杯，"喝了这个。上面附有一点勇气符咒，能让你短暂振奋，帮你度过最初的紧张。"

Shinji debated for a second, then grabbed the glass and downed the clear liquid. It burned its way down his throat and immediately warmed his stomach. He felt his nervousness fade as he recalled his analogue-daughter's advice from yesterday. He knew he could handle this. 'And haven't I had a dream or two like this? Running on dreams has worked out better than I'd have thought today. Might as well keep going.'

绫波犹豫了片刻，随即抓起杯子，一饮而尽那清澈的液体。它如烈焰般灼烧着他的喉咙，旋即温暖了他的胃。随着回忆起昨日养女般的她给予的忠告，他的紧张感逐渐消退。他坚信自己能够应对这一切。“况且，我不也做过类似的梦吗？在梦境中奔跑，今日看来，效果远超预期。不妨继续前行。”

He took Asuka's hand. "May I have this dance, my love?"

他牵起明日香的手，问道：“亲爱的，我可以请你跳这支舞吗？”

She looked at him warily. "Do you have any idea what the Hell you're doing, Third?"

她警惕地看着他。“你到底知不知道自己在做什么，老三？”

"Trust me." 相信我。

The laser-focus look was back again, with another long, silent pause. Shinji faced it without trouble this time. He really did know what he was doing. He was dreaming. That liquid courage sure helped.

那激光般专注的眼神再次出现，伴随着又一次长久的沉默。这次，真嗣面对它毫无困难。他确实知道自己正在做什么。他在做梦。那种液体勇气确实帮了大忙。

"Alright." Asuka gently took his hand and they walked off the low edge of the stage and out onto the dance floor. The lights in the hall dimmed and spotlight's beam fell on them as they reached the center.

"好的。" 明日香轻柔地握住他的手，两人从舞台低矮的边缘走下，步入舞池。大厅的灯光渐渐暗淡，聚光灯的光束在他们抵达中央时恰好落在他们身上。

Shinji placed his free hand on Asuka's waist and held their joined hands off to the side. "Ready?" he asked her as the first stirrings of a waltz began to fill the hall.

真嗣将空闲的手搭在明日香的腰间，将两人紧握的手移至一旁。“准备好了吗？”他问道，此时华尔兹的最初旋律开始在大厅中回荡。

"Me? I know how to dance, Third. I taught you everything you know when we were synch training," Asuka retorted. "And I don't recall teaching you a waltz. What do you think you're doing?"

“我？我当然会跳舞，第三。我们同步训练时，你学的一切都是我教的，”明日香反驳道，“而且我不记得教过你华尔兹。你这是在做什么？”

He smiled. "What am I doing? I'm dreaming. Let's just say that learning how to speak German isn't the only NILS course I took yesterday. Shall we dance?" Shinji gently took the lead and they stepped off right on the beat into a swirling dance.

他微笑着说：“我在做什么？我在做梦。不妨告诉你，昨天我上的不仅仅是学习德语的 NILS 课程。我们跳舞吧？”碇真嗣温柔地引领着，两人恰好踩着节拍，旋即融入了一场旋转的舞蹈中。

Misato watched her two former charges move to the center of the dance floor, led by a confidently striding Third Child, and begin a perfectly performed waltz. She walked closer to Daniel. "Ah, …sir? Just what the Hell did you give him?"

美里看着她曾经的两位学生被自信迈步的第三适格者引领至舞池中央，开始了一段完美演绎的华尔兹。她走向丹尼尔，问道：“啊，…先生？您到底给了他什么？”

"Exactly what I said, Lieutenant Katsuragi; there was indeed a Charm of Courage on that glass."

正如我所说，葛城中尉；那块玻璃上的确附有勇气符咒。

Misato looked at the dancing couple again. "Wow. That's what a little courage can do?"

葛城美里再次望向那对翩翩起舞的情侣，心想：“哇，这就是一点点勇气能做到的吗？”

"Of course," the Emperor continued, "In about five minutes the Charm will wear off. Right about then the rest of that 'liquid courage' will kick in."

"当然，"皇帝继续说道，"大约五分钟后，那魅力就会消退。差不多那时候，剩下的'液体勇气'就会起作用了。"

Misato slowly turned her head back to him. "You didn't…"

葛城美里缓缓地将头转回他那边。“你没有……”

He grinned. "Well, I had to put the Charm on something. The 100 proof Nenya Argentum Grande rum in the glass was the perfect carrier."

他咧嘴一笑：“嗯，我总得把魅力施加在什么东西上。那杯中 100 度的南雅银辉特级朗姆酒，正是完美的载体。”

Misato tried not to laugh as she looked at the dancing pair again. "Oh, this is going to be wonderful. He's not a Lieutenant thirty seconds and you're already screwing with him?"

美里努力忍住笑意，再次看向那对跳舞的人。“哦，这将会很精彩。他才不是中尉三十秒，你就开始捉弄他了？”

"Welcome to the Imperial Army, Lieutenant Katsuragi. 'If you can't take the joke, you shouldn't have signed up', as we say." He shrugged. "It's one glass, and if he's really still flying high from the Charm when it wears off, he may not even notice the transition. Some people really do benefit from a little liquor to keep down the nerves. If we can keep his mind off his own insecurities, his love for that girl will keep him rolling hot all evening. And it's about time you collect your fiancé and get out there too. Off with you." He shooed them away. Misato grabbed Ryoji's hand with a grin and pulled him along.

欢迎加入帝国军，葛城中尉。正如我们所说，“如果受不了玩笑，就不该报名。”他耸了耸肩。“就一杯酒，如果他魅力消退后还飘飘然，可能都不会注意到过渡。有些人确实需要一点酒精来平复紧张。只要我们能让他不去想自己的不安，他对那女孩的爱会让他整个晚上都热情高涨。你也该去接你的未婚夫，一起出去了。快去吧。”他挥手让他们离开。葛城带着笑容，一把抓住了绫波的手，拉着他一同前行。

Newly-minted Lieutenant Suzuhara was sweating nervously as he gave his new commander-in-chief a good imitation of a deer in headlights. "I…I don't know how to dance!" he stuttered, near panic.

新晋中尉铃原紧张得满头大汗，面对新任总指挥，他那副模样活像一只受惊的小鹿。“我……我不会跳舞！”他结结巴巴地说，几乎要陷入恐慌。

The Empress chuckled. "Neither did my husband, the night we met. Just do what he did."

皇后轻笑道：“我丈夫初次遇见我那晚也是如此。照他那样做便是。”

Touji shifted his panicky stare to her. "What did he do?"

冬二慌张地转而盯着她。“他做了什么？”

The Emperor snorted. "I faked it. It's amazing what a snappy uniform and remembering not to look down will accomplish."

皇帝哼了一声。“我装出来的。一套帅气的制服加上记得不要低头，能创造奇迹。”

"Don't let him fool you," the Empress murmured, sidling up to her husband to wrap an arm around his waist, surprisingly silent for being in full armor. "This one needed a boot to the backside from a Chaplain's Assistant to ask me to dance that night."

"别让他骗了你，"皇后低声说着，悄悄靠近丈夫，伸手环住他的腰，身着全副盔甲却出奇地沉默。"那晚他可是被牧师助理踢了一脚才来请我跳舞的。"

"Hey, I'm sure Lieutenant Suzuhara will agree with me when I say 'talking to pretty girls is scary!'" Daniel protested. Touji nodded frantically.

"嘿，我敢肯定，当我说'和漂亮女孩说话很可怕'时，铃原中尉会同意我的！"丹尼尔抗议道。东治疯狂地点头。

"Touji?" Hikari said quietly from behind him. He whirled in place to stare at her, still sweating furiously. "I know how to dance. Just follow my lead."

"投掷？" 光在他身后轻声说道。他原地转身盯着她，依旧汗流浃背。"我知道怎么跳舞。跟着我的节奏就行。"

Touji looked at her for a minute, the swallowed. "O-okay," he stuttered again. Hikari's face lit up as she took his hand and led him out onto the dance floor.

透二凝视了她一会儿，然后咽了口唾沫。“好-好的，”他再次结巴道。光的脸庞顿时亮了起来，她牵起他的手，领着他走向舞池。

Kensuke Aida gave Ching a hopeful look. She rolled her eyes, and took his hand. "Never say I never did you any favors, kid," she told him, taking his hand. He nodded, beaming.

相田剑介向阿静投去一个充满希望的眼神。她翻了个白眼，握住了他的手。“别说我没帮过你，小子，”她边说边握住他的手。他点头微笑，满面春风。

She held his arm up in the air and shouted to the crowd, "Hey! Ladies! He's single! And needs a dance partner!"

她高举他的手臂，向人群喊道：“嘿！女士们！他单身！还需要一个舞伴！”

Several voices eagerly called back in response from the far side of the dance floor. Aida gulped, but didn't totally lose his smile.

舞池对面，几道声音急切地回应着。艾达咽了口唾沫，但笑容并未完全消失。

Part 41 第四十一章

Drinks & Dancing 饮品与舞蹈

Shinji was still feeling pretty good. His feet smoothly found their way through the steps of the dance almost without having even to think of it, he thrilled at the way Asuka swung and swayed with him, and he could have sworn his hands on her hip and clasped with hers were tingling. The one of hers that was lightly laid on his shoulder sure felt like it was made of electricity, the way it had his head buzzing. He just kept feeling better and better, dizzy and floating. This was a very nice dream.

真嗣依旧感觉相当不错。他的双脚几乎无需思考便流畅地踏出舞步，与明日香一同摇摆旋转令他兴奋不已，他敢肯定，自己放在她腰间与她相握的手掌正微微发麻。她轻搭在他肩上的那只手，仿佛带着电流，让他的头脑嗡嗡作响。他只觉得越来越好，晕眩而飘然。这真是个美妙的梦境。

Asuka's eyes had never left his, the laser-like focus never drifting. He wasn't finding it intimidating anymore. Now it was just a wonderful, endless chance to lose himself in her eyes. He'd always loved the crystal shade of blue that her eyes were, deep as an endless sky...

明日香的目光从未离开过他的双眼，那激光般的专注始终未曾游移。他不再觉得这有任何威慑力，如今这成了一个美妙无比、无穷无尽的机会，让他沉醉于她的眼眸之中。他一直钟爱着她那如水晶般湛蓝的眼色，深邃如同无垠的天空...

After long minutes of them twirling across the floor, more and more couples and some trios had joined the dance. She hadn't said anything since they started dancing, and while her eyes had never shifted from his, a pensive look had grown on her face.

经过数分钟在舞池中旋转，越来越多的情侣和一些三人组加入了舞蹈。自开始跳舞以来，她一直未发一言，尽管她的目光始终未曾离开他，但脸上却逐渐浮现出沉思的神情。

"Who are you?" she asked suddenly, her eyes continuing to search his.

"你是谁？"她突然问道，目光依旧在他眼中探寻。

"What?" "什么？"

"Who are you? The Third Child that was my roommate in Misato's apartment would have retreated to his room, put in his SDAT, and curled into his shell for hours if someone had told him to take me out on a public dance floor like this. The Third I knew a month ago would have already apologized a dozen times and gotten me hugely pissed off doing or saying something idiotic by now. The Shinji Ikari I woke up next to this morning admitted to staring at my ass, blew my mind in the shower twice, and now just asked me 'May I have this dance, my love?' in German he didn't even know yesterday! I've remembered who I am now. But who are you? If you are going to be watching my back in every fight from here until I release you, I want to know who the Hell it is I'm… talking to."

你是谁？如果是住在美里公寓里那个与我同寝的三号孩子，若有人让他带我上这样的公共舞池，他定会退回房间，戴上 SDAT，蜷缩起来数小时。一个月前我所认识的三号，此刻恐怕已道歉十几次，并因说些蠢话做些傻事而让我大为光火。而今早与我同床醒来的碇真嗣，竟坦承偷瞄我臀部，在淋浴间两次让我心神荡漾，现在又用他昨天还不会的德语问我：“亲爱的，能请你跳支舞吗？”我已记起自己是谁。但你又是谁？若从此刻起直至我释放你，你都将守护我身后，我必须知道与我对话的究竟是何方神圣。

"Who am I? I thought philosophical musings were my department," he joked quietly.

"我是谁？我以为哲学沉思是我的领域呢，"他轻声打趣道。

"I'm serious, Shinji!" "我是认真的，真嗣！"

"I know, Asuka. I'm sorry." He paused to try to collect his thoughts. "I…don't quite know. You know I've never been good at expressing myself in words."

我知道，明日香。对不起。"他停顿了一下，试图整理思绪，"我……不太清楚。你知道我向来不擅长用言语表达自己。"

Asuka snorted. "Do tell, Third."

明日香哼了一声。“说来听听，老三。”

"I'm…yours. That much I'm very sure of. The rest…I'm still figuring out. Everything I used to blame myself for, all the deaths I held myself responsible for, all the fears I had….right now we're undoing them all. I still feel the guilt, but at least the consequences are being healed…and with that, maybe I can forgive myself some of it, too. So I'm Shinji Ikari, the clean slate. I want my friends and…my family to be happy. I want to love you and make you happy. I want to give you everything. Everything about me is yours."

我……属于你。这一点我非常确定。其余的……我仍在摸索中。过去我自责的一切，所有我为之负责的死亡，所有的恐惧……此刻我们正在一一解开。我仍感愧疚，但至少后果正在愈合……随之而来，或许我也能宽恕自己一部分。所以我是碇真嗣，一张白纸。我希望我的朋友和……我的家人幸福。我想爱你，让你快乐。我想给你一切。我的一切都属于你。

"Don't." 别。

Shinji's brow furrowed. "What?"

真嗣的眉头紧皱。“什么？”

"Don't… just give yourself away to me like that. Don't let yourself be defined by events. That's what you've done all the time, Shinji. You… react. You let the world tell you who you are. You're ready to give all of yourself away to me? Don't. I don't want you to give so much of yourself away to me that there's no one left to push back at me. You want to be my… my boyfriend, then be that, not my appendage. You want to make me and everyone else happy? Decide who you are, then make the world change to be what you want from it. I want you to do those things because you're the kind of man who does them.

别…就这样轻易将自己交给我。别让事件定义了你。你一直都在这么做，真嗣。你…只是反应。你让世界告诉你你是谁。你准备好将全部的自己交给我了吗？不要。我不希望你将太多的自己交给我，以至于没有人能反抗我。你想成为我的…我的男朋友，那就去做，而不是我的附属品。你想让我和大家都快乐吗？那就决定你是谁，然后让世界改变成你想要的样子。我希望你做这些事，因为你就是那种会做这些事的人。

Shinji hesitated slightly, uncertain. "So I want to be the man who can make that all happen, whoever that is."

真嗣略显迟疑，心存疑虑。“所以我想成为那个能让这一切成真的人，无论那人是谁。”

Asuka held him with a very serious look. "And is that man Shinji Ikari?"

明日香用非常严肃的表情抓住他，问道：“那人就是碇真嗣吗？”

Shinji managed to bite down on saying 'Is that what you want?', getting the idea that would be exactly proving the point Asuka had just said not to. 'She just told me to decide myself who I am. So is that who I want to be? Who am I right now?' He smiled at her and sighed happily. "I love you, Asuka."

真嗣忍住了脱口而出“这就是你想要的吗？”的冲动，意识到这恰恰印证了明日香刚刚告诫他不要做的事情。“她刚刚告诉我，要我自己决定我是谁。那么，这就是我想成为的人吗？我现在是谁？”他微笑着，幸福地叹了口气。“我爱你，明日香。”

Her serious expression flickered to a slightly warmer one for a second, but came back. "And I like hearing that, but don't think that gets you out of answering my question."

她严肃的表情瞬间闪过一丝暖意，但很快又恢复如初。"我喜欢听你这么说，但别以为这样就能让你免于回答我的问题。"

"I don't think that. I just wanted to say that because I'm feeling better right now that I think I ever have before. I'm dancing with the girl I'm in love with, who I've finally had the guts to tell that to, my friends are around us, and you just asked me a deep, important philosophical question like 'who are you?' in complete seriousness and want a serious answer. This has been the best day of my life."

我不这么认为。我只是想说，此刻我感觉比以往任何时候都要好。我正与我深爱的女孩共舞，我终于鼓起勇气向她表白了，我的朋友们就在我们周围，而你刚刚认真地问了我一个深刻而重要的哲学问题——“你是谁？”并期待一个认真的回答。这真是我生命中最美好的一天。

Asuka colored a bit. "You're getting better at the sweet talk, Third. Now answer me."

明日香微微脸红。“你甜言蜜语的本事见长了，老三。现在回答我。”

"Who am I? I am Shinji Ikari. I am the man who is going to make you happy and stand by you, because that's who I want to be."

我是谁？我是碇真嗣。我是那个将要让你幸福并与你并肩站立的人，因为那是我想要成为的人。

Asuka held his eyes for a few more seconds, then slid her hand from his shoulder to the back of his head to pull him down for a short, soft kiss. "Good."

明日香又凝视了他几秒，随后将手从他的肩膀滑至脑后，轻轻一拉，让他低下头来，两人交换了一个短暂而温柔的吻。“很好。”

After a long, wonderful time on the dance floor, a pause in the music and their own thirst finally drove them back to their table for something to drink. Shinji had found a second small glass at his place, and had gone with that. Asuka had finished her wine and asked for some of what he was having from a literally hovering waiter bot. They'd just clinked glasses in a silent, shared toast when Shinji looked up to find his mother sitting down next to them. "Mother!"

在舞池中度过了一段漫长而美妙的时光后，音乐的停顿和自身的口渴终于促使他们回到桌边，想要喝点什么。真嗣在自己的位置上找到了第二只小酒杯，便选择了它。明日香喝完了她的葡萄酒，向一位实际上悬浮着的侍者机器人要了些真嗣正在喝的东西。他们刚碰杯，无声地共饮一杯时，真嗣抬头一看，发现母亲正坐到他们旁边。“妈妈！”

"Hello, Shinji. You both looked wonderful out there. I'm sorry I couldn't be here for the dinner and earlier, but we watched your commissioning on the screen in our cabin." Yui Ikari's pleased maternal smile faded. "I've been talking to your father, and he hasn't been taking it well, but he did want me to tell you both that he will find a way to make amends."

你好，真嗣。你们俩在那边表现得真棒。很抱歉晚餐和之前没能来，但我们已经在船舱的屏幕上观看了你的就职仪式。" 碇唯那充满母爱的满意笑容渐渐淡去，"我一直在和你父亲交谈，他情绪不太好，但他确实想让我告诉你们俩，他会找到办法弥补的。

The pleasant buzz in Shinji's head was not enough to keep his face and his mood from darkening somewhat at this. "And my answer hasn't changed from yesterday, mother. I'll forgive him if and when Asuka does. You can probably add Rei to that, if she still even thinks about it."

新治脑海中的愉悦嗡鸣不足以阻止他的脸色和心情在此刻略显阴沉。“我的回答和昨天一样，母亲。我会原谅他，如果和当明日香原谅他时。你或许还可以加上零，如果她对此还有所思的话。”

"I know. I think he understands a bit now about how badly he hurt you both. After we talked this afternoon, I explained to him that Sohryu-san is to you what I am to him. He…he just sat staring at the wall for an hour after that. He wouldn't respond to me at all. Then Rayana just stared at him until he looked up at her and started crying. Rayana said…'neither madness nor death are allowed to you as an escape, Commander, until your sins are redeemed.' After that, he just said that he'd find some way to begin trying to atone."

我知道。我想他现在多少明白了，他给你们俩造成了多大的伤害。今天下午我们谈过之后，我向他解释了，对于你来说，明日香小姐就如同我对他一样重要。他……他就那样呆呆地盯着墙壁坐了一个小时，对我的话毫无反应。然后雷亚娜就一直盯着他，直到他抬头看向她，开始哭泣。雷亚娜说……“指挥官，在你赎清罪孽之前，疯狂和死亡都不是你的逃避之路。”之后，他只是说他会找到某种方式，开始尝试赎罪。

Asuka snorted. "He's going to have to come up with something pretty impressive to make up for planning to end the world and stepping all over Shinji's entire life in pursuit of that. And as for me and Wondergirl? Good luck there too. I don't know if my existence ever even registered as more than background noise in his mind. I wasn't his end-the-world doll or your soul in Eva Unit-01, so I might as well have been furniture to him, like every other person in the world. Shinji and I could have been lovers, blood enemies, or about to start a hockey team back then, and I'm not sure he would have noticed, or cared if he did." Suddenly a nasty grin dawned on Asuka's face. "Ooh, there's an evil idea… ne, Shinji, how about we forgive your dad after he gets to go through everything we had to?"

明日香嗤之以鼻。“他得拿出相当惊人的东西来弥补策划毁灭世界，以及为了这个目的践踏真嗣整个人生的行为。至于我和 Wondergirl？祝他好运。我不知道我的存在在他心中是否曾留下过比背景噪音更深的痕迹。我不是他用来结束世界的玩偶，也不是 Eva 初号机里的灵魂，所以我对他来说可能就像家具一样，跟世界上其他人没什么两样。那时候，真嗣和我可以是恋人、血仇，或者正准备组建一支曲棍球队，我都不确定他是否会注意到，或者即使注意到了，他是否会在乎。”突然，明日香脸上露出了一个邪恶的笑容。“哦，有个邪恶的想法……呐，真嗣，不如等你爸经历了我们所经历的一切后，我们再原谅他如何？”

Shinji looked warily puzzled. "What do you mean?"

真嗣带着戒备的困惑问道：“你什么意思？”

"I mean, all the stuff we had to suffer because of him, he gets too. First he gets abandoned by everyone for ten years, then gets his arm broken and an energy spike through his right eye and out the back of his head, blown up, stabbed through the chest with two electric tentacles, shot in the chest with a terawatt laser, chewed on by a giant fish, pile-drivered headfirst into the dirt twice, blown up again, dunked into a volcano, splashed with acid, smashed from orbit, stuffed into a sensory deprivation tank for a night, choked, gets his arms and head ripped off, dissolved into LCL for a month, mind-raped, stabbed in the neck and chest, and then disemboweled by nine winged monsters with spears! Oh, and a spear through the head, too."

我是说，我们因为他遭受的所有苦难，他也得承受。先是被人抛弃十年，然后手臂骨折，右眼被能量冲击贯穿后脑，被炸飞，胸口被两条电触手刺穿，被太瓦级激光射穿胸膛，被巨鱼啃咬，头部两次被砸进土里，再次被炸，被投入火山，被酸液溅射，从轨道上被砸下，被塞进感官剥夺舱一夜，被勒住，手臂和头部被撕裂，溶解成 LCL 一个月，精神被侵犯，颈部和胸部被刺，最后被九只持矛的翼兽开膛破肚！哦，还有一矛穿头而过。

Picturing the morbidly funny spectacle in his head of his father getting put through all the tortures they had been through in their Evas actually got Shinji to laugh. "Sounds like a good start!" He took another drink. "Should we make him wear a leotard and learn a synchronized dance routine with Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki, too?"

想象着父亲被迫经历他们在 EVA 中所受的种种折磨，那荒诞可笑的场景竟让真嗣笑出声来。“听起来是个不错的开始！”他又喝了一口。“我们是不是也该让他穿上紧身衣，和副指挥官冬月一起学个同步舞蹈呢？”

Yui looked saddened at the litany of terrors her son and his fellow Pilot had suffered through, but carried on. "I'd like you to at least come see him some time in the next few days, both of you. He's more aware of how much he did to you both, and the idea of losing me not by the separation of death but by you and I both rejecting him has very thoroughly got his attention. I think Rayana was right in at least that respect about you both, Shinji. Your father's personal vision of Hell is life without me, and I think you'd feel something like the same way if you two were separated."

结城看着儿子和他的战友所经历的一系列恐怖，面露悲伤，但仍继续说道：“我希望你们至少在接下来的几天里能来看看他，你们俩都来。他现在更清楚自己对你们俩造成了多大的伤害，而失去我并非因死亡的分离，而是你我共同拒绝他的想法，已经彻底引起了他的注意。我认为拉雅娜至少在这一点上对你们俩的看法是正确的，真嗣。你父亲个人眼中的地狱就是没有我的生活，我想如果你们俩分开，你也会有类似的感觉。”

Shinji suppressed the spike of terror that shot through him on hearing that, and shared a very unhappy look with Asuka at even the spectre of the idea. Their hands quickly sought each other and linked tightly together. "Won't happen," Shinji said.

听到这话，真嗣强压下心头涌起的恐惧，与明日香交换了一个极为不悦的眼神，仿佛那念头只是幽灵般的幻影。两人的手迅速寻找彼此，紧紧相扣。“不会发生的。”真嗣说道。

"Not going to happen," Asuka said almost simultaneously. "He's sworn."

"不会发生的，"明日香几乎同时说道，"他发过誓。"

Yui smiled a little at that. "But I'm sure that gives you some idea of how the loss would feel. He treated you all horribly, but he's still the man who fell in love with me. Don't punish him forever, Shinji."

绫波微微一笑，说道：“但我想这能让你多少体会到失去的感觉。他虽然对你们很糟糕，但他毕竟是对我倾心的男人。别永远惩罚他，真嗣。”

"I'll think about it, mother. But not tonight. Today's been a very good day, and I don't want to bring down the mood now worrying about father. I've got happier things to focus on tonight." He smiled as he rubbed the back of Asuka's hand.

我会考虑的，妈妈。但不是今晚。今天过得很愉快，我不想现在就担心爸爸而破坏了气氛。今晚我有更开心的事情要关注。" 他微笑着，轻抚着明日香的手背。

"Fair enough. I'm going to get back to keeping an eye on your father. I don't want to leave him alone for too long in his state. Goodnight." Yui rose along with Shinji, gave him a hug, and left.

"说得也是。我得回去继续留意你父亲了，他现在这样，我不放心让他一个人待太久。晚安。" 绫波丽随着真嗣站起身，给了他一个拥抱，然后离开了。

Shinji took another sip of his drink. "Hmm…maybe I should have some of this before I try talking to my father. A little extra courage couldn't hurt."

绫波又抿了一口饮料。“嗯……或许在尝试和父亲交谈之前，我应该先喝点这个。多一点勇气总没坏处。”

Asuka snorted. "Easy on the liquid courage, Third. I want you functional later." She looked at him with her head cocked slightly. "I never would have figured you for a rum guy, Third."

明日香哼了一声。“少喝点壮胆酒，三号。我待会儿还需要你干活呢。”她歪着头看着他，“真没想到你会是喜欢朗姆酒的那种人，三号。”

Shinji blinked at her. "What are you talking about?"

真嗣眨了眨眼看着她。“你在说什么？”

She gestured at his half-full glass with her own. "Your drink. That's some pretty smooth rum we're having."

她举起自己的杯子，朝他那半满的酒杯示意。“你的酒。这朗姆酒喝起来真是顺滑。”

Shinji looked at his glass in surprise. "Is that what this is? Daniel just said it had a 'charm of courage' on it."

真嗣惊讶地看着手中的玻璃杯。“这就是所谓的‘勇气之符’吗？丹尼尔只是说它上面有‘勇气之符’。”

Asuka looked at him like he was joking. "Are you seriously telling me you didn't recognize that as alcohol as soon as you tasted it? That's like your third glass already, baka-Shinji. Be careful. I don't want you falling asleep on me later. I have a serious question I want to ask you."

明日香看着他，仿佛他在开玩笑。“你真的告诉我，你一尝就知道那是酒精吗？这已经是你的第三杯了，笨蛋真嗣。小心点。我不想你待会儿在我面前睡着。我有个严肃的问题要问你。”

Shinji's head was buzzing a little more. "It's… my head is buzzing and I feel kind of floaty."

真嗣的头嗡嗡作响得更厉害了。“就是……我的头嗡嗡响，感觉有点飘飘的。”

Asuka nodded. "Yup. It's hitting you. You didn't notice?"

明日香点点头。“嗯，你感觉到了。没注意到吗？”

"I've never been drunk before."

我从未醉过。

Now Asuka looked surprised. "Seriously? Never?"

此刻，明日香显得很惊讶。“真的吗？一次也没有？”

Shinji shook his head a little carefully. "Seriously. Never had the desire or interest before. And in Boston… well, what they had mostly went to Winthrop's troops."

真嗣小心翼翼地摇了摇头。“说真的，以前从未有过这种欲望或兴趣。在波士顿嘛……嗯，他们大部分都归温索普的部队了。”

"Wow… You really didn't notice how your head was getting kind of fuzzy?"

"哇…你真的没注意到你的头开始有点晕乎乎的吗？"

"I… just thought it was being with you, and having an awesome night," Shinji said with a slight flush.

“我……只是觉得和你在一起，度过一个美妙的夜晚，” 真嗣略带羞涩地说道。

Asuka snorted. "Being around me makes you feel like you're drunk?"

明日香哼了一声。“在我身边让你感觉像喝醉了似的？”

"I feel like I'm floating, my head is buzzing, and I want to kiss you? Yeah, that's pretty much the usual. Just more and… stuff."

我感觉自己仿佛在漂浮，脑袋嗡嗡作响，还想吻你？嗯，这基本上是常态了。只是更强烈些，还有……其他的感觉。

"In vino veritas, Third? I make you drunk, huh? Heh." Asuka's look at her glass turned pensive. "It… it was never hard to get in Berlin. Winthrop and Jinnai always had it around. I… it helped me stay… numb, sometimes."

"酒后吐真言，对吧，第三？我让你醉了，嗯？嘿。" 明日香看着她的杯子陷入了沉思。"在柏林，这从来都不难弄到。温沃斯和阵内总是有存货。我……它有时帮我保持……麻木。"

Shinji scooted his chair closer so he could put an arm around her shoulders. "I'm sorry."

真嗣把椅子挪近，伸手揽住她的肩膀。“对不起。”

Asuka shook her head. "I'm not going to let the past rule me. It…it's different now. I'm enjoying the buzz in a different way, Shinji. Misato said something about it back when, something like how being drunk with friends is a whole different deal. She was right." Asuka suddenly smiled at him. "And I was thinking earlier how I felt kind of drunk when we were making out, and how I wanted to try it when I actually was drunk, to see what it was like. So c'mere, you." She grabbed the front of his uniform and pulled him to her.

明日香摇了摇头。“我不会让过去束缚我。现在……现在不同了。我在以不同的方式享受这种兴奋，真嗣。美里以前说过一些关于这的话，大概是说和朋友一起喝醉是完全不同的体验。她是对的。”明日香突然对他微笑。“我之前在想，当我们亲热时，我感到有点醉意，我想在我真的喝醉时尝试一下，看看是什么感觉。所以，过来吧，你。”她抓住他的制服前襟，将他拉向自己。

The buzzing in Shinji's head kicked into high gear and he had no idea how long they remained lip-locked before Misato's sitting down in Kaji's lap at her spot at the table broke into his awareness. It was still a long moment before he and Asuka separated to look at them. Misato's ear-to-ear grin made Shinji flush, but he couldn't stop his own grin in response.

真嗣脑海中的嗡鸣声骤然加剧，他完全不知道他们唇齿相依了多久，直到美里坐到加持腿上，占据了餐桌旁的位置，这一幕才闯入他的意识。又过了好一会儿，他和明日香才分开，转头看向他们。美里那咧到耳根的笑容让真嗣脸颊泛红，但他自己也不禁露出了回应的笑容。

"Well, well, well. Feeling frisky, Asuka?" Misato laughed at her.

“哎呀，哎呀，哎呀。感觉很活泼嘛，明日香？” 美里笑着对她说。

Asuka stuck her tongue out at her. "Just the results of the fine upbringing your example provided us, oh sterling guardian."

明日香朝她吐了吐舌头。“这可都是拜您那模范般的监护所赐，哦，光辉的守护者。”

Misato waved her be-ringed left hand at her. "You haven't followed my fine example all the way yet."

美里向她挥了挥戴着戒指的左手，“你还没完全效仿我的好榜样呢。”

"I think we'll do better than waiting eight years and a break-up," Asuka shot back.

"我觉得我们不会像等了八年还分手那样，" 明日香反驳道。

"I hope so," Misato said, turning more serious. "Kaji and I got scared, and let that drive us apart for too damn long. And then I lost him, just when we'd come back together. We let our fears get in the way of our happiness. Don't make that mistake."

"希望如此，" 美里说，神情变得严肃起来。"我和加持因为害怕，让那恐惧把我们分开得太久了。然后，就在我们重归于好时，我却失去了他。我们让恐惧阻碍了我们的幸福。别犯同样的错误。"

"We've already done that, too, Misato," Asuka said as she pulled her glass closer for another sip. "We had a bad few years that you missed out on. We're making up for lost time too."

"我们也已经那样做了，美里，"明日香说着，将她的杯子拉近，又抿了一口。"你错过的那几年，我们过得很糟糕。我们也在弥补失去的时光。"

Misato determinedly put a smile back on. "At least we've found a nice place to do it in. Daniel already promised me a never-ending supply of Yebisu for our campaign. And they'll cover the bill for whatever kind of wedding reception we want."

碇司令坚定地重新挂上笑容。“至少我们找到了一个不错的地方来办这件事。丹尼尔已经答应我，会为我们提供源源不断的惠比寿啤酒。而且，无论我们想要什么样的婚礼招待会，他们都会承担费用。”

"Which is good, since I haven't gotten paid in a few years on account of being slightly dead. I don't think I could pay for much of a ceremony right now," Kaji put in, which earned him a poke in the temple from his fiancée.

"这倒是好事，毕竟我因为稍微死了几年，已经好几年没领到工资了。现在我可办不起什么像样的仪式，"卡吉插话道，结果被他的未婚妻在太阳穴上戳了一下。

"None of that anymore, you. Remember, you get killed again, and I bring you back to life so I can kill you myself. And Rayana said they can really do that kind of thing around here, so watch it, mister!" Misato took some of the impact out of her threat by finishing it up with a long kiss.

“别再那样了，你。记住，你要是再被杀，我就把你复活，好让我亲自干掉你。而且雷亚娜说这里的人真能办到这种事，所以小心点，先生！” 三笠用一个长吻缓和了她威胁的语气。

"Same goes for you, Third. You're not allowed to get killed. You're mine now," Asuka said before dragging him in likewise.

"你也是，老三。你不许被杀。你现在属于我了，" 明日香说完，同样将他拽了进去。

Misato heard her comment and laughed as she pulled away from her man. "Sounding kind of possessive, Asuka. Thinking about staking a claim?"

听到这话，明日香笑了笑，从男人身边退开。“听起来有点占有欲啊，明日香。在考虑宣示主权吗？”

Asuka's eyes stayed locked on Shinji's. "Maybe I am," she said softly. "Maybe I am."

明日香的目光紧紧锁定在真嗣的眼睛上。“也许我是，”她轻声说道，“也许我是。”

Shinji swallowed, and reached for more 'courage'. 'That is somehow terrifying and wonderful at the same time. Yet… there's no one else I'd rather hear that from more than Asuka.'

真嗣咽了咽口水，伸手去寻找更多的“勇气”。‘这既令人恐惧又美妙无比。然而……我更愿意从明日香那里听到这些。’

A darker shadow flitted across Asuka's face for a moment, but she likewise grabbed her glass and finished the remainder at a single gulp. She held the cool glass against her forehead for a moment, then stood up and pulled Shinji's hand along. "Come on, Third Child. They've switched from waltzes to slow dances. I feel like some more dancing."

阿苏卡脸上瞬间掠过一丝阴霾，但她同样抓起酒杯，一饮而尽。她将冰凉的杯子贴在额头上片刻，随后站起身，拉着真嗣的手说：“走吧，第三适格者。他们已经从华尔兹换成了慢舞，我想再跳会儿舞。”

### Chapter 23 Courage, Shonichi

Warning, slightly lemon ahead.

前方微虐预警。

Courage 勇气
t was most of an hour later before fatigue and thirst again returned them to their table. This time their hosts were waiting before the young Pilots sat down. The Emperor waved Shinji aside before he could do more than pull out Asuka's chair for her. She gave them a questioning look, to which Daniel said, "Sorry, Asuka. I need to talk to Shinji for a few minutes. Boy talk."

大约一个小时后，疲惫和口渴再次将他们带回桌前。这次，他们的主人已经在等待，年轻飞行员们还未坐下。皇帝在真嗣能为明日香拉开椅子之前就挥手让他退到一旁。明日香投去询问的目光，丹尼尔回应道：“抱歉，明日香，我需要和真嗣谈几分钟，男人间的谈话。”

Asuka rolled her eyes at this a little, but waved a slightly tired acknowledgement and brightened up as Ching sat down on her other side. Daniel gestured for Shinji to follow him a bit down the stage to the next table, currently empty but for the Division Command Sergeant Major, who smartly nodded and vacated the table for them as they approached. Shinji eagerly accepted a glass of ice water from Daniel as they sat. He had never imagined he could work up such a thirst just dancing.

明日香对此略翻白眼，但带着些许疲惫挥手示意，当青坐在她另一侧时，她又精神起来。丹尼尔示意真嗣跟着他稍稍走下舞台，来到下一张桌子旁，那里除了分区指挥军士长外空无一人，他们走近时，军士长机敏地点头并为他们腾出了位置。真嗣坐下时，急切地接过丹尼尔递来的冰水。他从未想过仅仅是跳舞就能让自己如此口渴。

"Did you ever see the old Disney animated film 'Dumbo', Shinji?"

"真嗣，你看过迪士尼的老动画电影《小飞象》吗？"

Shinji shook his head. What a strange question. He had to leave Asuka for film study now?

真嗣摇了摇头。这问题真奇怪。他现在得为了电影研究离开明日香吗？

Daniel sighed. "Kids these days, just no classical education. Ah well, telling you 'there is no magic feather' won't have the same impact, then. Anyhow, after seeing how much a little 'liquid courage' helped you out, I thought it would be a good point to share with you the 'secret' to beating fear without having to check the proof on the bottle."

丹尼尔叹了口气。“现在的孩子，就是缺乏古典教育。唉，告诉你‘没有魔法羽毛’也不会有同样的效果了。不管怎样，看到一点‘液体勇气’对你帮助这么大，我觉得是时候和你分享一下不用查看瓶子证明就能战胜恐惧的‘秘诀’了。”

"The 'secret' to beating fear'?" Shinji echoed doubtfully. "Does that come in a pill instead of a bottle?"

"战胜恐惧的'秘诀'？" 真嗣怀疑地重复道，"难道是用药片代替瓶子吗？"

Daniel gave a short chuckle at Shinji's sardonic counter. "Good to see you're feeling better enough to joke back at me. You're going to need all the snark you can find over the next few months to keep yourself and Asuka mentally together, I'm sure. Hell, snarky commentary is one of your subtle strengths in quite a few worlds, you might as well run with it here if you've got it. I use an entire Empire to cover my end. Whatever strength you can find, son, you use it. So. You want to know the secret of how to beat your fears?"

丹尼尔对真嗣的讽刺反驳轻笑了一声。"看到你能恢复到跟我开玩笑，真是太好了。接下来的几个月里，你和明日香要想保持精神上的稳定，肯定需要你所有的尖酸刻薄。说起来，在不少世界里，尖刻的评论是你的一项隐秘优势，如果你有这本事，在这里不妨也发挥一下。我用整个帝国来支撑我的立场。无论你能找到什么力量，孩子，你都要用上。那么。你想知道如何战胜恐惧的秘密吗？"

"I don't know, have an entire Empire at your beck and call, maybe? That's got to help. What have you got to be afraid of if you've got ships the size of small planets on standby and an Army you can loan out on a few days' notice?" Shinji said.

"我不知道，或许拥有一个任你调遣的庞大帝国？这肯定有帮助。如果你有随时待命、大小堪比小行星的舰队，还有一支几天内就能借出的军队，你还有什么好怕的？" 真嗣说道。

"That just makes doing things easy. It doesn't make the fear go away."

那只是让做事变得简单。并不能让恐惧消失。

Shinji looked at him, frowning. "You've got an Army, a Navy, wings, magic, you can raise the dead, travel through time, and you expect me to believe you're scared of something?"

真嗣皱着眉头看着他，说道：“你拥有陆军、海军、空军、魔法，你能复活死者，穿越时空，你还指望我相信你有什么害怕的？”

"I'm always afraid, Shinji. I've just learned the secret; it doesn't matter."

我总是害怕，真嗣。我刚得知了那个秘密；其实无关紧要。

"'It doesn't matter'? You're always afraid? Afraid of what?"

"‘没关系’？你总是害怕？害怕什么？"

"I'm sure you ran across Sir Francis Bacon at some point in studying philosophy, yes?"

"在学习哲学的某个阶段，你肯定遇到过弗朗西斯·培根爵士，对吧？"

Shinji nodded. "Of course."

真嗣点了点头。“当然。”

"And did you ever run across one of his more quoted lines, on families?" Daniel asked

你可曾遇到过他那句常被引用的关于家庭的话？丹尼尔问道

Shinji shook his head. "I may have, but I can't remember it right now."

真嗣摇了摇头。“我可能有过，但现在记不起来了。”

"'He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune, for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.' I'd disagree with the rest of his argument, that family men are hindered by having such from doing truly great things. I find that having a family, especially one as large as mine, gives all the greater need to make the universe better for them. Eh, but my arguments with Sir Francis can wait."

“有妻儿者，已向命运交出人质，因其成为伟大事业之障碍，无论美德或恶行。”我不同意他其余的观点，即家庭之人因拥有这些而无法成就真正伟大的事业。我认为拥有一个家庭，尤其是像我这样庞大的家庭，反而更需努力让宇宙变得更好，以造福他们。唉，但我与弗朗西斯爵士的争论可以暂且搁置。

Daniel took a sip from his own glass. "I'm sure you've figured out by now that I'm quite old. And in that time I've had many children. Hundreds the old fashioned way; nearly as many adopted, created, found, and other gatherings. And I'm old enough that they have had children of their own, and so on for many generations. There are by this point quintillions on quintillions of my direct descendants at loose in the omniverse. And that's not even counting the almost uncountable numbers of Subjects and Citizens that are my children in spirit. I cannot be everywhere at once, outside of Avalon itself. So I live with the constant worry that somewhere, at some time I will fail them. I know that it can and will happen because it has before."

丹尼尔轻啜了一口自己的酒。“我相信你现在已经明白，我非常年长。在这漫长的岁月里，我拥有过许多孩子。传统方式生育的就有数百人；而通过收养、创造、发现及其他方式聚集起来的，也几乎同样多。我已足够年迈，他们也已各自繁衍后代，如此代代相传，至今我的直系后裔已遍布全能宇宙，数以千万亿计。而这还未计入那些在精神上视我为父，数量几乎无法统计的臣民与公民。我无法同时出现在每一个地方，除非是在阿瓦隆本身。因此，我时刻担忧着，在某个时刻、某个地点，我会让他们失望。我知道这会发生，也必将发生，因为过去已有先例。”

"You've failed?" Shinji was slightly surprised. "All the power you've got that I've seen, your own Army and Navy and I don't know what else, and it's still not enough? How….if you're trying to tell me not to be afraid, you seem to be going about it badly. This isn't exactly filling me with courage to hear that I could be as powerful as you and it still wouldn't save the people I care about. What good is it if all it means is you get to fail bigger?"

"你失败了？" 真嗣有些惊讶。"你所拥有的所有力量，我见过的你的陆军、海军，还有其他我不知道的，这些还不够吗？这……如果你是想告诉我不要害怕，你似乎做得不太对。听到即使我像你一样强大，也无法拯救我在乎的人，这并不能给我勇气。如果这一切只意味着你能以更大的规模失败，那又有什么用呢？"

"Because my children make me proud enough to weep. Ask some of my people about the CGS Ibthan's Dragonfly sometime, or cases like that. You already know the 'secret', Shinji. I'm just walking you through the logic to let you understand it. You ran away once, after the 13th Angel, because you didn't want to have to face Piloting anymore, because it hurt the people around you, yes?"

因为我的孩子们让我骄傲到足以落泪。有空问问我的部下关于 CGS Ibthan 的蜻蜓，或是类似案例。你已经知道那个“秘密”了，真嗣。我只是带你梳理逻辑，让你理解。你曾在第 13 使徒事件后逃离，因为你不想再面对驾驶，因为它伤害了你周围的人，对吧？

Shinji looked away. "Yes. I did. It didn't work. Asuka and Rei stayed and fought the 14th Angel, and it tore them both apart. My pride and cowardice, but they paid the cost."

真嗣转过头去。“是的，我试过了。但没成功。明日香和绫波留下来与第 14 使徒战斗，结果两人都被撕碎了。是我的骄傲和懦弱，而她们却为此付出了代价。”

"But you came back. You saved everyone just in time. Weren't you afraid?"

但你回来了。你及时救了所有人。你难道不害怕吗？

Shinji's eyes burned into his. "Of course I was! Afraid I'd screw up again! Afraid I'd fail! I was practically screaming the entire time, and then I was absorbed by Eva Unit-01 when I couldn't finish the Angel fast enough! If it hadn't been for mother…" Shinji looked down at his hands wrapped tightly around his glass.

真嗣的目光灼灼地盯着他。“我当然害怕！怕自己又搞砸！怕自己失败！我几乎全程都在尖叫，然后因为没能迅速击败使徒，被初号机吞噬了！如果不是因为妈妈……”真嗣低头看着自己紧紧握着杯子的双手。

"So you've learned running away is no good. The world keeps going without your permission anyhow, and running just leaves those you care for vulnerable to the threats you refuse to face. You could have died or failed at any point, yes. But you still came back," Daniel said equably.

所以你已经明白逃避并非良策。世界无论如何都会继续运转，无需你的允许，而逃避只会让你关心的人暴露在你拒绝面对的威胁之下。你本可能在任何时刻死去或失败，是的。但你终究还是回来了，”丹尼尔平静地说道。

"I had no choice!" "我别无选择！"

"Yes, you did. You were afraid, but did it anyway."

是的，你做到了。你虽然害怕，但还是去做了。

"Yes!" "是的！"

Daniel just stared at him. Shinji calmed his heaving breaths and stared back. "What? That's it? That's your 'secret'?!"

丹尼尔只是盯着他。真嗣平复了急促的呼吸，回以凝视。“什么？就这样？这就是你的‘秘密’？！”

Daniel raised an eyebrow. "You were expecting some sort of mystic wisdom from beyond the boundaries of time and space?"

丹尼尔挑了挑眉。“你期待着来自时空边界之外的某种神秘智慧吗？”

"I was hoping for a bit more than 'do it anyway'!"

我本希望得到的建议不止是“无论如何去做”！

"Consider the motto of all my forces; Illic Non Est Quod Timor. 'There is no such thing as fear.' There's a lot of complexity in that simple statement, Shinji. Be afraid all you want. As long as it doesn't stop you, you can make it not matter. It's not that I'm not afraid; it's that I don't mind being afraid. Courage isn't the absence of fear; it's the disregard of it. I fear that every time one of my people goes out there to face danger, it will be the time I can't help them when they need me. They know it too. They do it anyway. So do I. So did you. It's not being unafraid, it's feeling the fear and letting it fall aside and you choosing what to do regardless. Courage is an act of will, Shinji. You know how to do it. You've done it before. And now you've got more reason than ever before to do it again."

思考我所有力量的座右铭：Illic Non Est Quod Timor，意为“恐惧并不存在”。这个简单的表述蕴含着深刻的复杂性，真嗣。你尽可以感到害怕，只要它不阻碍你前行，你就能让它变得无关紧要。并非我不感到害怕，而是我不在乎自己是否害怕。勇气并非无所畏惧，而是对恐惧的漠视。我害怕每一次我的部下面临危险时，可能会是我无法在他们需要时伸出援手的那一刻。他们也明白这一点，但他们依然勇往直前，我也一样，你也曾经如此。这不是无所畏惧，而是在感受到恐惧的同时，任其消散，然后你自主选择行动。勇气是意志的体现，真嗣，你知道如何去做，你以前也做到过。而现在，你有了比以往更充分的理由再次展现勇气。

"You mean Asuka." 你是说明日香。

"I do, and not just the way you might think. There's more to courage than just on the battlefield. You two look pretty happy together tonight. But deep inside she's still afraid. I think sooner than you might expect, she's going to ask you for something serious, something scary, and you better be ready."

我确实这么认为，而且不仅仅是你可能想到的那种方式。勇气不仅仅体现在战场上。今晚你们俩看起来很幸福。但内心深处，她仍然害怕。我想，比你预期的要早，她会向你提出一些严肃的、令人害怕的事情，你最好做好准备。

"Serious and scary like what?"

严肃而可怕，像什么？

"Serious and scary like this morning. That kind. She needs…she needs love, essentially, Shinji. Badly. She's been putting up a harsh front for most of her life to hide an almost desperate wish for someone to love her."

像今早那样严肃而可怕。就是那种。她需要……她本质上需要爱，真嗣。非常迫切。她一生中大部分时间都在用严厉的外表来掩饰内心几乎绝望的渴望，希望有人能爱她。

"I do! She knows that now!" Shinji said firmly. "I've told her!"

"我愿意！她现在知道了！" 真嗣坚定地说，"我已经告诉她了！"

"Words are powerful, it's true, but she's going to need proof beyond words. Hearing it and knowing it are different things. She's going to need to know. So I think very soon she's going to ask you, maybe not with words, for something that proves it to her on a deep level, a level of belief. Don't let fear cripple you when that happens. The reward is more than worth the risk."

言语的力量确实强大，但仅凭言语她需要更多的证据。听闻与确信是两码事。她需要的是深信不疑。因此，我想她很快就会向你索要，或许不是用言语，而是某种能让她从内心深处信服的证明。当那一刻来临时，切莫让恐惧束缚了你。回报远超风险，绝对值得。

Shinji looked over at their table, watching Asuka laugh with Ching and Hikari at something. "I…I know. I want…I want to give her everything. Anything she needs, anything she wants."

真嗣望向他们的桌子，看着明日香与阿静和光因为某事而笑得正欢。“我……我知道。我想要……我想要给她一切。她需要的，她想要的，任何东西。”

"So when she asks, just push the fear aside and be there for her. Everything else will be easy."

所以当她开口时，只需将恐惧抛诸脑后，陪伴在她身边。其他一切都将变得简单。

"'There is no such thing as fear', huh?" Shinji muttered. "Guess it's time for me to get something better than 'I mustn't run away'."

"‘不存在恐惧这种东西’，是吗？" 真嗣喃喃自语。"看来是时候找一句比‘我不能逃避’更好的话了。"

Daniel stood up. "Whatever you want as a personal motto, Shinji. Remember that we are who we choose to be. Just keep in your head that the reward is worth more than the fear, and you'll be alright. Now let's get back to our ladies before they start plotting mayhem on us for keeping them waiting."

丹尼尔站起身来。“真嗣，无论你想要什么样的个人座右铭，记住，我们是我们选择成为的人。只要铭记在心，回报比恐惧更有价值，你就会没事的。现在，我们得赶紧回到女士们身边，免得她们因为等待而开始策划对我们不利的事。”

Part 43 第 43 章

初日- Shonichi 初日 - 朔日
everal hours later.. 几小时后...

The door to the beach cabin banged open from Asuka's kick and rebounded against the wall fast enough she gave it a hip check as she pulled Shinji along by the hand after her through the door. Their progress was slower than it might have been thanks to the fact that Shinji was only slightly more steady on his feet by this point than she was. Ergo, there was a certain amount of sideways involved in every step forward as they stumbled and giggled their way across the living room and towards the hallway to the bedrooms. Neither one of them noticed the small smile on Mother Sriyana's face as she silently bowed and exited as they passed her in the hall, nor really registered her presence at all.

沙滩小屋的门被明日香一脚踹开，重重地反弹到墙上，她拉着真嗣的手，用臀部顶了一下门，带着他穿过门。由于此时真嗣的脚步比她稳不了多少，两人的行进速度比预想的要慢。每迈出一步，都伴随着些许踉跄和欢笑，他们穿过客厅，向卧室走廊走去。两人都没注意到斯里亚纳妈妈脸上那抹淡淡的微笑，她默默地鞠了一躬，从他们身边悄然离去，而他们甚至未曾真正意识到她的存在。

It was just as well that the ridiculously oversized bed in their room was also nicely soft, as their joint and parallel landing definitely left something to be desired in terms of gracefulness. Shinji congratulated himself for only landing partly off the bed and face-first. He considered it a rather neat bit of navigation considering how steadily his head felt like it was spinning and the way the floor kept sliding about under his legs. He rolled himself onto his side so he could open his eyes again. Asuka was even more fun to look at tonight than she usually was; with relatively infrequent exceptions, she'd spent much of the remainder of the evening smiling. And not even anything like the usual sarcastic, bitter, or biting grins she had sometimes worn in the month since their reunion, but a real, happy smile. The kind that had flickered across her face on all too rare occasions back in the good days of living in Misato's apartment, before things had begun their terrible slide into madness and death. He'd loved seeing that look on her face, even as he'd always damned himself back then for never doing much to bring it out. The other, crueler smiles she had were aimed at him too often to make him feel confident enough to dare searching after the brighter kind.

房间里那张大得离谱的床倒是挺柔软，这对他们同时并排着陆来说算是万幸，毕竟优雅程度实在不敢恭维。真嗣庆幸自己只是半身掉下床且脸先着地，考虑到他感觉头一直在转，地板又在脚下晃动，这已经算是相当巧妙的着陆了。他翻身侧躺，再次睁开眼睛。今晚的明日香比往常更令人赏心悦目；除了偶尔的例外，她余下的夜晚大多面带微笑。这笑容并非她重逢后一个月里时而露出的那种讽刺、苦涩或尖刻的笑，而是真正幸福的微笑。那种曾在美好时光中，住在美里公寓时难得一见的笑容，那时一切尚未滑向疯狂与死亡的深渊。他喜欢看到她这样的表情，尽管那时他总在自责，为何没能多做些什么来唤起这样的笑容。 她那些更为残忍的笑容也常常是冲着他来的，这让他不敢有足够的信心去追寻那种更明亮的笑容。

The kind of smile she wore now, or at least as far as he could tell. She had likewise landed mostly face-first on the mattress, though she evidently found it very amusing, as she kept giggling until she also rolled onto her back and caught him staring at her.

她此刻露出的笑容，至少在他看来是这样。她同样几乎是脸朝下扑倒在床垫上，但她显然觉得这非常有趣，一直咯咯笑个不停，直到她也翻过身来仰面躺着，发现他正盯着她看。

"Noooo shooezz on the bed, Baka-Shinnnnji!" she slurred at him, and raised one of her legs as she rolled onto her back to demonstrate she'd kicked off her red stilettos by wiggling her toes at him. He only peripherally noted the wiggling digits, though. The long, long, perfectly formed leg that was revealed as her motion caused her dress to ride up and pile around her hips was far more attractive to his attention. The sheer white stocking encasing the leg hid the silky smooth skin he knew lay underneath, but was also nice to look at, so he did. He spent long enough running his eyes up and down the arch of her leg that Asuka started laughing at him.

"不许把鞋子放床上，笨蛋真嗣！" 她醉醺醺地冲他嚷道，一边翻身仰躺，抬起一条腿，向他展示自己已踢掉红色高跟鞋，脚趾还调皮地扭动着。然而，他只是略微注意到那些扭动的脚趾。随着她的动作，裙子卷至腰际，露出那条修长完美的大腿，更吸引他的目光。包裹在透明白色丝袜下的肌肤，虽遮掩了其下丝滑细腻的触感，却同样赏心悦目，令他不禁凝视良久。直到明日香开始嘲笑他，他才回过神来。

"You have the stupidest look on your face right now, Shinji. Can't take your eyes off my luscious legs?" She brought her leg back down as she rolled towards him, wrapping it around him and hooking him closer. "But you're looking at me. You're always looking at me. Why didn't you do that back then?" Asuka hiccupped. "I always worried you were looking at that shtupid blue-haired bitch. Acting so perfect. Who tha' fuck does she think she is, telling me I can't have you? Yer mine. You said so. I'm tha' one who gets to dance with you. I'm tha' one who gets to have you in my bed. Mine. Mmm… in my bed, in my shower, anywhere I want you. Mine. Yer mine. …aren't you?"

你现在脸上那副蠢样，真让人受不了，真嗣。是不是挪不开眼，盯着我这诱人的腿呢？她边说边翻身向他靠近，将腿缠绕在他身上，把他拉得更近。“可你在看我，你总是在看我。为什么那时候不这么做呢？”明日香打了个嗝。“我总担心你在看那个愚蠢的蓝发贱人。装得那么完美。她以为她是谁啊，还敢说我不能拥有你？你是我的。你说过。只有我才能和你共舞。只有我才能让你躺在我的床上。我的。嗯……在我的床上，在我的浴室里，我想让你在哪就在哪。我的。你是我的。……对吧？”

Shinji managed a wobbly nod, rubbing his face against the blanket. "I'm yours in the shower, bed, and stuff. Wait, you can't dance in a shower. Can you?"

真嗣勉强地点了点头，脸颊蹭着毯子。“洗澡、睡觉还有其他时候，我都是你的。等等，洗澡时不能跳舞吧。你能吗？”

Asuka released her leg from around him and sat up, giving him a serious look. "You are still funshkshion… functioning, right, Third Child? I'm supposed to ask you something."

明日香松开缠绕在他身上的腿，坐起身来，严肃地看着他。“你还在正常运作吧，第三适格者？我有事要问你。”

Shinji struggled upright and fought with his uniform jacket for a minute. "Yes. I am. Preefectly fin," he said carefully, nodding in agreement with himself. "You can ask nee manything."

真嗣挣扎着坐直，与他的制服外套搏斗了一分钟。“是的，我很好，”他小心翼翼地说，边点头边自我确认。“你可以问我任何事。”

Asuka stood up and carefully removed her Wounded Lion and hung it back around the neck of the mannequin still wearing her unused uniform before removing her gloves and continuing with undoing the choker and zipper of her dress. Shinji happily stared at her as the red silk dress slid down her body to puddle at her feet. The sight of the stunning redhead in white lace undergarments, a garter belt, and thigh-high stockings was enough to freeze him in place from raw beauty alone. Add in the unwavering stare she was directing right at him and it utterly removed any power he had to do anything but drink in the sight of her. After a while he did have to remind himself to breathe, though.

明日香站起身，小心翼翼地将她的“受伤的狮子”取下，重新挂回仍穿着她未使用制服的人台上，随后脱下手套，继续解开裙子的领结和拉链。红色丝绸长裙顺着她的身体滑落，堆叠在脚边。眼前这位红发美人，身着白色蕾丝内衣、吊袜带和及膝长筒袜，仅凭其纯粹的美貌便足以令他凝固。再加上她那毫不避讳直视他的目光，彻底剥夺了他除了尽情欣赏她之外的任何行动能力。过了一会儿，他不得不提醒自己呼吸。

"Yer lookin' at me again, Shinji."

“你又在看我了，真嗣。”

Shinji was nearly betrayed by too-deep reflexes. He broke his gaze away from her and mumbled, "I'm sorr-.."'Oh shit… aaaand I'm too buzzed to help. You're on your own, buddy,' his brain unhelpfully observed, a second too late. 'Well, a fat lot of good you are, thanks,' he thought at himself.

真嗣差点被过于深刻的本能所背叛。他移开目光，喃喃道：“我……对不起。”“哦，糟糕……而且我醉得太厉害，帮不上忙。你自求多福吧，伙计。”他的大脑不甚及时地评论道。“哼，真有你的，多谢了。”他暗自腹诽。

He was saved by the unexpected agency of Asuka grabbing his head with her hands and dragging him back to look at her. "Don't you ever dare say you're sorry for looking at me, Shinji. I want you to look at me. Always. Not her, not anyone else. You look at me. Please."

他意外地被明日香用双手抓住头部，拉回来直视她的眼睛。"真嗣，你永远不要因为看我而道歉。我希望你看着我，永远。不是她，也不是其他人。你只看着我。求你了。"

Before he could even try nodding in stunned agreement, she looked aside herself. "I want to ask you something, Shinji. And I want you to answer me honestly. I…I've been thinking about it all night, so don't get the idea that it's just something that… that's the drinks talking, ok?" She took a deep breath and let her hands fall away from his head to grasp his hands. She hauled him up off the bed. "Get undressed. I want us both lying down comfortably when I ask you this."

在他还未来得及尝试震惊地点头同意之前，她已将目光移向一旁。“真嗣，我想问你件事，希望你诚实地回答我。我……我整晚都在思考这个问题，所以别以为这只是酒后胡言，好吗？”她深吸一口气，双手从他头上移开，转而紧握他的手，用力将他从床上拉起。“把衣服脱了。我想在我们都舒服地躺下时再问你这个问题。”

Even stone sober Shinji would have hardly been inclined to argue with a command from Asuka, especially one like that. As he was currently by his best count at least four sheets to the wind, he was even less likely to question it. As quickly as he could he stripped out of his shirt and pants, tossing them to the floor on the far side of the bed. He wobbled to an uncertain stop when he got down to his boxers. 'Crap crap crap… do I… how far… oh, fuck it, roll the dice for once in your life, Ikari. It's worked out so far today. All the rules are out the window and you're down the rabbit hole. If this is another Instrumentality-induced dreamworld, I'm starting to lose any care if it's not real. If this is a dream, I don't want to wake up anymore.' He steeled himself and slid the last of his clothing off. ''There is no such thing as fear', he says. Please don't let me fuck this up!'

即便是清醒无比的真嗣，也几乎不会违抗明日香的命令，尤其是这样的命令。而此刻，据他最好的估计，自己至少已是四杯酒下肚，更是无意质疑。他迅速脱掉衬衫和裤子，扔到床的另一边。当只剩下内裤时，他摇摇晃晃地停了下来，心中忐忑不安。'糟糕糟糕糟糕……我该……到什么程度……哦，去他的，这辈子就赌一次吧，碇真嗣。今天到目前为止一切顺利。所有规则都已抛诸脑后，你已坠入兔子洞。如果这又是由人类补完计划引发的梦境，我已经开始不在乎它是否真实了。如果这是梦，我再也不想醒来。'他鼓起勇气，脱掉了最后一件衣物。'他说，没有什么可怕的。请别让我搞砸了！'

Turning back to face Asuka, he was suddenly gripped by terror that he'd overestimated his hand. Asuka was still standing in her white lace underwear, no expression on her face as she watched him. She didn't even overtly seem to react to his nudity, merely smoothly waving him towards the bed. He lay down and tried not to self-consciously cover himself with his hands.

他转过身面对明日香，突然被一种恐惧攫住，担心自己高估了自己的处境。明日香依旧站在那里，只穿着白色蕾丝内衣，脸上没有任何表情，只是静静地看着他。她似乎并没有对他的裸露做出明显反应，只是流畅地示意他朝床边走去。他躺下，尽量不让自己下意识地用手遮掩身体。

"Relax, Third. I've seen it, remember?" Asuka said softly as she lay down next to him. She laid her head down exactly even with his and just looked at him for a long silent moment. "Shinji… I want to ask you… to make me another promise."

"放松点，真嗣。我见过那场景，记得吗？" 明日香轻声说着，躺在他身边。她将头放得与他齐平，静静地凝视了他好一会儿。"真嗣……我想让你……再给我一个承诺。"

"Anything, Asuka." "任何事，明日香。"

"No, not 'Anything, Asuka'. I want you to think about this, and I want an answer more serious than anything you've ever said before," she firmly cut him off. "I… need to be able to trust your answer on this more than any other one."

"不，不是'什么都行，明日香'。我希望你认真考虑这个问题，我希望得到的答案比你以往任何一次都要严肃，"她坚定地打断了他。"我……需要能够比以往任何一次都更加信任你的这个回答。"

Shinji fought the urge to panic as he feverishly tried to marshal his thoughts on what she might be asking that could be so serious. The way his thoughts were wobbling around like a not-so-precision drill team made entirely of Jello soldiers was not helping. "I will, Asuka. What do you want me to promise that's more serious that owing you a life and watching your back until I do?"

真嗣极力抑制住内心的恐慌，拼命整理思绪，试图揣测她究竟要问什么如此严重的问题。他那如同由果冻士兵组成的、不甚精准的仪仗队般的思绪摇摆不定，这可帮不上忙。“我会的，明日香。你想让我承诺什么，比欠你一条命、直到还清之前一直守护你更严肃的事情？”

Asuka tried to hold her eyes on his, wavered, then looked past him over his head. "I want you to… I want you to…" She pinched her eyes closed and locked them back on his when she opened them again. "Can you promise me you'll always be there, Shinji? Promise me you'll never leave me again?"

明日香试图将目光锁定在他的眼睛上，却犹豫了，随后越过他的头顶望向远处。“我想要你……我想要你……”她紧闭双眼，再次睁开时又将目光牢牢锁回他的眼睛。“你能答应我，你会一直在那里吗，真嗣？答应我，你永远不会再离开我？”

Shinji managed not to jerk as his whole body froze in place. Even his 'I've never been this drunk before'-muddled thought processes were aware enough to sound every alarm bell in his head at that question. Asuka wasn't just asking for reassurance of his physical presence by her in the future. She was asking for far, far more.

真嗣努力控制住自己，没有因为全身僵硬而抽搐。即便是他那因“从未如此醉过”而混乱的思绪，也足够清醒地在他脑海中拉响了所有警报。明日香不仅仅是在寻求他未来身体上陪伴的保证。她所求的，远比这多得多。

'Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods'

哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊

Shinji tried to get a grip on himself. She… she wanted him to promise to stay with her. To never leave her. Wasn't that what he'd always wanted to give her? Hadn't he already made that offer during the strangeness of Instrumentality, an offer she'd rejected back then? But now she was asking him. She'd surrendered to his being around her for the foreseeable future a month ago, but in a defeated, resigned way. A foreseeable future that they'd both sensed the fragility and tenuousness of. He'd spent the next month desperately trying to find a way closer to her, terrified that she'd get tired of his presence as nothing more than a painful reminder of better times. 'O! Him she stores, to show what wealth she had… In days long since, before these last so bad.' flitted through his head.

真嗣试图让自己冷静下来。她……她希望他承诺留在她身边，永不离开。这不正是他一直想给予她的吗？在人类补完计划那段奇异时期，他不是已经提出过这样的提议，只是当时被她拒绝了吗？但现在，她却在请求他。一个月前，她已经无奈地接受了他在可预见的未来里陪伴她的事实，但那是一种失败和放弃的态度。他们都察觉到了这段未来脆弱而不稳定。接下来的一个月里，他拼命地试图找到更接近她的方法，害怕她会厌倦他的存在，将其视为美好时光痛苦的提醒。'哦！她珍藏着他，以展示往昔的富足……在那些久远的岁月，比这最后的糟糕时光更美好。'这句话在他脑海中掠过。

"I… 'I want to help you somehow, and stay with you forever', I said once," he said slowly. "I've made this offer before, Asuka."

"我……'我想以某种方式帮助你，并永远和你在一起'，我曾经这样说过，"他缓缓地说道，"我以前也提出过这个提议，明日香。"

She winced and her eyes dropped away from his again, but fought their way back after a moment. "Yes, you did. And I ripped your heart out and then you tried to strangle me. I'm… sorry. I was… I didn't need to… hurt you like that. You…"

她皱了皱眉，目光再次从他身上移开，但片刻后又努力地转了回来。“是的，你确实那么做了。而我撕碎了你的心，然后你试图掐死我。我……对不起。我当时……我本不必……那样伤害你。你……”

"I'd just let you die because I was in a damn-near suicidal self-pitying funk that Misato died trying to snap me out of. You… I owe you more an apology than you owe me."

我本会让你死去，因为我陷入了近乎自杀式的自怜深渊，而美里为了让我摆脱这种状态而牺牲了。你……我欠你的道歉远比你欠我的多。

She didn't seem to hear him. "And I… I'm sorry! I'm sorry I hurt you so fucking much every time I open my stupid fucking mouth and I'm tired of it hurting all the damn time and having to drink myself numb every week so I don't try putting Winthrop's gun in my mouth or running a hot bath and grabbing a razor and waking up fucking screaming every goddamn night… and… and… it doesn't hurt when you hold me. You make it stop hurting. I want you… I don't want you to ever go! Promise me, Shinji! Please!" She sat partway up and grabbed him by the shoulder, her grip desperately tight.

她似乎没听见他的话。“而我……对不起！对不起我每次一开口就他妈的伤你那么深，我厌倦了这该死的痛楚无时无刻不在，厌倦了每周都得把自己灌醉才能不去想用温斯洛的枪对准自己嘴巴，或是放一缸热水拿起剃刀，厌倦了每个该死的夜晚醒来时尖叫……还有……还有……当你抱着我时，它就不痛了。你让它停止了疼痛。我需要你……我不想你离开！答应我，真嗣！求你了！”她半坐起身，紧紧抓住他的肩膀，那握力充满了绝望。

Shinji hardly felt it as he tried to swallow through a suddenly dry throat. 'I make it stop hurting?' "Asuka. I… I'm… I owe you a life. And I just said tonight I want to be the one who makes you happy and stands by you. I promise I won't ever leave you until you make me go, and if that's forever, then that's what I'm going to do. I love you. I'm yours."

真嗣几乎没感觉到自己试图吞咽时喉咙突然的干燥。'我能让你不再痛苦吗？' "明日香，我……我……我欠你一条命。我今晚才说过，我想成为让你快乐、陪伴在你身边的人。我承诺，除非你让我离开，否则我永远不会离开你，如果那意味着永远，那我就会这么做。我爱你，我是你的。"

Asuka eyes just burned into his almost feverishly for a long minute. She slowly nodded, released his shoulder, and sat all the way up. "Then… I want you to do something for me, Shinji." She turned away from him to face the wall. Shinji had just long enough to wonder if she was about to leave or something before Asuka pulled her hair up over her left shoulder. She looked back over her right shoulder and said very softly, "I want you to take my bra off."

明日香的目光仿佛带着炽热，紧紧地盯着他，持续了许久。她缓缓点头，松开了他的肩膀，坐直了身子。“那么……我想让你为我做件事，真嗣。”她转过身去，面对着墙壁。真嗣刚来得及疑惑她是否要离开或做什么，明日香便将头发撩至左肩之上。她回过头，从右肩望向他，声音轻柔地说：“我想让你帮我解开胸罩。”

A roaring sound overtook the buzzing in Shinji's head, followed by the sound of his pulse, which rose to a sound like rapid thunder, drowning out all thought. 'She's not asking me to just remove her bra, oh gods…' And he wanted to answer a resounding 'yes!' to the silent, implied question; are you willing to try again?

一阵轰鸣声盖过了真嗣脑海中的嗡嗡声，紧接着是他的脉搏声，急促如雷鸣般响起，淹没了一切思绪。'她不是让我仅仅解开她的胸罩，哦，天啊……' 他渴望对那个无声而含蓄的问题给予响亮的肯定回答：你愿意再试一次吗？

He raised shaking hands to fumble with the hooks at the middle of the strap. He suddenly had all the manual dexterity of a half-blind tipsy sloth; it took him more than three tries to undo all three hooks. The straps fell away and down her arms. Asuka raised her arms enough to let the now loosened bra slip off her hands and onto the floor. She kept facing the wall for a second, then swiveled her legs and body around to face him again.

他颤抖着双手摸索着带子中间的挂钩。突然间，他的手巧得像半瞎又微醺的树懒；解开三个挂钩竟让他尝试了不止三次。带子松脱，顺着她的手臂滑落。明日香抬起手臂，让已松开的胸罩从手中滑至地板，她仍面朝墙壁片刻，随后转动双腿和身体，再次面向他。

"Now… I want you to… take my… my panties off too."

现在……我想让你……也把我的……我的内裤脱掉。

The half-blind sloth had a few more drinks and his dexterity dropped a few more notches. 'Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods Oh Gods' was all his brain was contributing to the moment. His hands trembled like he'd abruptly contracted palsy as they hesitantly, carefully traced a trail up her legs toward the fine white lace edge of Asuka's panties. His fingers carefully hooked around the top edge and tugged them slowly down again. The lace caught for the barest second on her toes, to slightly bounce against Shinji's hands as it sprang free.

半盲的树懒又喝了几杯，他的灵巧度又下降了几分。'哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊哦天啊'，他的大脑此刻只能提供这样的反应。他的双手颤抖得仿佛突然患上了痉挛，犹豫而小心翼翼地沿着她的腿向上摸索，直至触及明日香内裤那精致的白色蕾丝边缘。他的手指谨慎地勾住蕾丝顶部，缓缓向下拉扯。蕾丝在她的脚趾上轻轻卡顿了一瞬，随即弹开，轻轻拍打着真嗣的手。

Asuka was down to just the garter belt and stockings, and he to nothing but his skin. He was worried for an instant that the alcohol and terror flashing through him would combine to prevent him from 'rising to the occasion', but a matching nanosecond check confirmed that he was in absolutely no danger on that front. Quite the contrary, he could probably have used it as a flagpole or a harpoon right now.

明日香只剩下了吊袜带和长筒袜，而他则一丝不挂。他瞬间担心酒精和恐惧交织会让他无法“振作起来”，但几乎同时的自我检查确认，在这方面他完全无需担忧。恰恰相反，他此刻的状态甚至可以用作旗杆或鱼叉。

He spared a moment to stare at the scrap of white lace dangling from his fingers before he dropped it off the edge of the bed behind him. As soon as he'd finally let it go, Asuka pushed sharply against his shoulder to knock him back down flat to the bed again. He lay slightly stunned on the soft mattress looking up at her. She looked right back down at him for a second, before she swung her leg high over him again to come back down on the other side, leaving her straddling him. Shinji's head spun and he bit down on a moan as he felt her incredible, fiery heat press against his shaft. He'd never been this aroused, not desperately staring at her in the Geofront hospital, not sadly fantasizing in his Boston exile, not during their pathetic, disastrous attempt at sex a couple of weeks ago, not even earlier that day in the shower together. Right now, Asuka Langley Sohryu owned him, mind, body, and soul. He'd do anything for her at this point, anything that would make her happy. 'Oh gods, please don't let me fuck this up! That's all that matters! I don't care anymore what happens to me! Let her be happy, please!'

他停顿片刻，凝视着指间垂下的那片白色蕾丝，随后将其丢弃至身后床沿之外。刚一放手，明日香便猛地推他的肩膀，将他再次推倒在柔软的床垫上。他略显恍惚地躺在那里，仰望着她。她低头凝视了他一瞬，随即高高抬起腿，再次跨过他，落在他另一侧，就这样骑坐在他身上。真嗣感到一阵眩晕，咬紧牙关压抑住呻吟，因为她那炽热无比的体温正紧贴着他的下体。他从未如此兴奋过，无论是绝望地凝视着她在 Geofront 医院的身影，还是在波士顿流亡时的悲伤幻想，亦或是几周前那次可悲而失败的性爱尝试，甚至当天早些时候一起淋浴时，都不曾有过。此刻，明日香·兰格雷·索拉尔完全占据了他的心神、肉体与灵魂。此时此刻，他愿为她做任何事，只要能让她快乐。“哦，神啊，请别让我搞砸这一切！这才是最重要的！我不在乎自己的命运如何！让她幸福吧，求你了！”

"Shinji…" Asuka raised herself up with a flex of her thighs as her hand grabbed hold of him and held him in position at her entrance. "You are mine. Always."

"真嗣…" 明日香大腿一用力，撑起身子，手抓住他，将他固定在自己的入口处。"你是我的。永远都是。"

"Always, Asuka. I always have been."

一直都是，明日香。我一直都是。

Her eyes glistened, just a hint. "Thank you," she whispered. Asuka's legs relaxed their tension, and she lowered herself down onto him.

她的眼中闪过一丝光芒，轻声道：“谢谢你。”明日香的腿放松了紧绷，缓缓地坐到了他身上。

And there was light. And it was good.

于是有了光。这光是好的。

### Chapter 24 Everyone Can See It

suka didn't want to open her eyes. She was warm, comfortable, and had been having some really nice dreams all night long. When was the last time she'd had a dream involving sex that she'd liked? …wait, she didn't have those kind of dreams. She hadn't had a good sex dream since before the Third Impact, and even that one had involved the Third Child too. She just had her constant bodyguard of nightmares… except for yesterday night. She hadn't had any dreams then. So where had a dream of all-night marathon sex come fro-…

明日香不想睁开眼睛。她感到温暖舒适，整夜都在做着一些非常美好的梦。她上一次梦到自己喜欢的性爱场景是什么时候？……等等，她不会做那种梦。自从第三次冲击之前，她就再也没有做过美好的性梦，即使有，也总是和第三适格者有关。她只有那些挥之不去的噩梦守护着她……除了昨晚。她那时并没有做梦。那么，这个关于整夜马拉松式性爱的梦是从何而来的呢？……

Asuka's eyes snapped completely open. 'Oh. Oh Gott. That wasn't a dream.'

明日香的眼睛猛地完全睁开了。哦。哦，天哪。那不是梦。

Her head was lying on Shinji's shoulder and she was still wrapped around him like he was a body pillow. Pre-dawn light was just beginning to filter in through the windows, so the room was not overly bright as yet. But there was already more than enough light to see Shinji's sleeping face, just inches away from hers. He looked completely at peace. She, on the other hand, felt… almost dizzy.

她的头枕在真嗣的肩上，依旧像抱着抱枕一样紧紧依偎着他。黎明的微光开始透过窗户洒入，房间尚未过于明亮。但已有足够的光线看清近在咫尺的真嗣安睡的面庞。他看起来无比宁静。而她，却感到……几乎有些眩晕。

'Holy fucking tap-dancing Jesus Christ on a pogo stick, that was no Gottdamned dream. I really did just spend all night riding Shinji Ikari like he was the Tokyo-3 subway system,' she marveled, halfway between disbelief and a growing urge to start giggling madly. 'He's mine, he's mine, he's mine, all mine! I claimed him, he's mine, go fuck yourself, Wondergirl, he's mine now, always and forever! And I feel… fucking amazing. I thought your first time was supposed to hurt, not be ridiculously multi-orgasmic. Scheiße, and Hikari was joking about Touji being a screamer! I'm lucky Ching's cabin is a good kilometer away and my mother's in a coma, or everyone would know what we were up to last night… although, come to think of it, I'm not sure I care who knows about… us. I'm happy. The rest of the world can go to Hell, I've got…' she looked at Shinji's sleeping face again. '…mine.'

神圣的操蛋踢踏舞耶稣基督在蹦床上，那绝不是他妈的梦。我真的整晚都在驾驭碇真嗣，就像他是东京 3 号线的地铁系统一样，'她惊叹道，半信半疑间又忍不住想疯狂地笑出声来。他是我的，他是我的，他是我的，全都是我的！我占有了他，他是我的，去你的，奇迹少女，他现在是我的了，永远永远！而我感觉……棒极了。我以为第一次应该是痛苦的，而不是荒谬地多重高潮。该死，而光还开玩笑说东治是个尖叫者！幸好秦的船舱离这儿有一公里远，我母亲又处于昏迷状态，否则所有人都会知道我们昨晚干了什么……不过，想想看，我其实不在乎谁知道我们……的事。我很快乐。剩下的世界可以去地狱了，我拥有了……'她再次看向真嗣熟睡的脸庞。'……我的。'

She squeezed her arms around him and happily burrowed her face into his shoulder. The squeeze and motion roused him from sleep and he slowly blinked his eyes open. When his gaze finally cleared enough to focus, he instantly locked eyes with Asuka and his eyes likewise widened completely. "Um… good morning?" he hesitantly asked.

她紧紧地抱住他，幸福地将脸埋进他的肩头。这拥抱和动作将他从睡梦中唤醒，他缓缓地睁开眼睛。当视线终于清晰到足以聚焦时，他立刻与明日香四目相对，眼睛也完全睁大。“呃……早上好？”他迟疑地问道。

'He looks like he's afraid I'm going to bite him. Hmm… what an excellent idea.' She raised herself up on her arm a little and teased at his neck with her tongue before closing in to nip and suck at his throat. Shinji's rapidly increasing pant suddenly swerved into a startled squeak as she applied her teeth, not pulling away until she was certain she'd left a nice, distinct mark well above where his shirt collar could possibly cover. "Good morning to you too, Shinji. No, that wasn't a dream. If it was, boy, are you a giant perv. Ravaging a poor innocent girl all night long like that…"

他看起来像是怕我会咬他似的。嗯……真是个绝妙的主意。' 她稍稍支起身子，用舌尖轻撩他的颈项，随后凑近轻咬并吮吸他的喉咙。当她用牙齿施加压力时，真嗣急促的呼吸突然转为惊慌的尖叫，直到她确信留下了一个清晰可见的印记，远高于他的衬衫领子所能遮掩的范围，才松开牙齿。"早安，真嗣。不，那不是梦。如果是的话，那你可真是个超级大变态。整夜蹂躏一个无辜的女孩……"

"'Poor innocent girl', huh? I think I recall somebody else doing most of the ravaging," he replied, a hesitant smile growing across his face.

"‘可怜的无辜女孩’，是吗？我记得好像是别人做了大部分的摧残，"他回答道，脸上渐渐浮现出一丝犹豫的微笑。

"Base lies and slander," Asuka said lightly. She flicked him in the nose and sat up to stretch. She was slightly surprised she didn't feel sore or overstretched at all, her body just kind of faintly humming with energy. She gave Shinji a crooked look as she noticed him staring rapturously at her arching stretch. "Lech. Come on, we're supposed to be starting our little adventure today. No lying in bed all morning shamelessly staring at my tits, Third."

"卑鄙的谎言和诽谤，"明日香轻描淡写地说道。她轻弹了一下他的鼻子，坐起身来伸展身体。她略感惊讶，自己竟然一点也不觉得酸痛或过度拉伸，身体只是隐约地充满活力。注意到真嗣正入迷地盯着她伸展的曲线，她斜睨了他一眼，"色狼。快点，我们今天应该开始我们的冒险了。别一大早就厚颜无耻地躺在床上盯着我的胸部看，三号。"

He smiled back for a moment, but Asuka could almost hear the onset of his perpetual self-doubt as the smile dimmed to his more common pensive introspection. "Asuka, last night…"

他回以微笑，但那笑容转瞬即逝，取而代之的是他惯有的沉思内省，明日香几乎能听见他内心不断滋生的自我怀疑。“明日香，昨晚……”

Asuka held his mouth shut with her hand. "Don't. Don't even start. No more doubts. I had fun, Shinji, both at the ball and after we got back here. You have any idea how long it's been since I had fun? I liked last night. Or did you miss the part where I was screaming at you for 'more! more!' in five languages? I want to keep on doing that. If you want to stay in my bed," 'And mmmm do I like the sound of that…' "Then don't be afraid of it. There is no such thing as fear, not for us, not anymore. I plan to take control of my life and live it at full speed. And I nn-" 'need?' "Ahem, I want you there with me. You're mine now, remember? You're going to have to learn how to run to keep up with me. You promised." 'Damn it, Third, don't you backslide now, not after last night. Yesterday may have been the 'best day of your life', but it wasn't that bed… I mean bad for me, either. Keep pushing, damn it!'

明日香用手捂住他的嘴。“别，别说出口。别再怀疑了。我很开心，真嗣，无论是舞会上还是我们回来之后。你知道我有多久没这么开心过了吗？我喜欢昨晚。还是说你没注意到我用五种语言对你喊‘还要！还要！’的部分？我想继续那样。如果你想留在我的床上，”嗯，我喜欢这个提议……“那就别害怕。对我们来说，恐惧已不复存在，不再有。我打算掌控我的生活，全速前进。而我——”需要？“嗯，我希望你在我身边。你现在属于我了，记得吗？你得学会如何跟上我的步伐。你承诺过的。”该死，第三，别在这时候退缩，尤其是在昨晚之后。昨天可能是你‘一生中最美好的一天’，但对我来说也不赖。继续前进，该死的！'

Shinji blushed at the specific reminder of some of what they'd done last night. Asuka had been demanding more out of him in every language she knew, ending with extremely loud and urgent German. Good thing he'd learned that yesterday, although it would have been pretty hard for anyone to mistake Asuka's intent when she was shrieking 'Mehr! Härter! Ja! Ja!' at the top of her lungs while doing her best to pound him through the bottom of the mattress. "I… right!" He rubbed the back of his head as he fumbled for what to say. "I… really liked last night too. And I promised… but…"

真嗣因昨晚某些行为的特定提醒而脸红。明日香用她所知的每种语言向他索求更多，最后以极其响亮而急迫的德语结束。好在昨天他学了这些，尽管当明日香竭尽全力将他压在床垫下，同时声嘶力竭地尖叫着“更多！更猛！是的！是的！”时，她的意图已经很难被误解了。“我……对！”他边揉着后脑勺边结巴地寻找着该说的话。“我……真的很喜欢昨晚。而且我承诺过……但是……”

"No, no buts. Damn it, Shinji, you were a man last night. You took me out on the dance floor and were everything you should have been years ago. Don't fold up now. Do I have to get you drunk for you to grow a pair? Hell, that worked as a coping mechanism for Misato." Asuka suddenly grimaced. 'Oh, fuck, why the Hell did I just say that? But if I start saying 'I'm sorry' all the damn time, I'll just sound like him. Think fast, Sohryu... crap, nothing else for it.' "I'm… I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry." She sighed. "I said this wasn't going to be easy, didn't I?"

不，别找借口。该死，真嗣，你昨晚可是个男子汉。你带我上了舞池，表现得就像几年前就该有的样子。现在别退缩。难道非得把你灌醉你才能硬气起来吗？见鬼，这对美里来说可是个有效的应对机制。"明日香突然皱起眉头。哦，该死，我他妈为什么要说那话？但如果我开始不停地道歉，那不就跟他一样了吗。快想，惣流...糟糕，没别的办法了。"我…我不该那么说的。对不起。"她叹了口气。"我早说过这不会容易，不是吗？"

Shinji gave her a weird little smile. "Yes, you did. Asuka, since the day we met, have you ever seen a day when I wasn't besieged by doubt? It's kind of what I do. Another reason I went for philosophy; doubt is a helpful bonus there." He looked her up and down, deliberately. "And you don't have to get me drunk. Last night was… not something I want to lose. And when it also means I get to wake up to mornings like this? I'm going to learn to keep up with you one way or another. I've got the great example of how messed up my father became when he lost my mother as an object lesson on what I don't want to become. I'm not going to lose you for anything."

碇真嗣对她露出了一个奇怪的微笑。“是的，你确实做到了。明日香，自从我们相遇以来，你见过哪一天我不是被怀疑所困扰吗？这几乎成了我的常态。这也是我选择哲学的原因之一；怀疑在那里是个有益的附加品。”他故意上下打量着她。“而且你不必把我灌醉。昨晚……是我不愿失去的。如果这意味着我能像这样迎接每一个清晨，我会想方设法跟上你的步伐。我父亲因失去母亲而变得一团糟，这成了我避免重蹈覆辙的反面教材。我绝不会因为任何事而失去你。”

Asuka threw a few more gratuitously esthetic stretches at him, enjoying the attention. "You keep bringing up philosophy, and I'm going to make you learn tensor calculus and number theory, see if I don't." She looked at him thoughtfully. "Hmm… you don't want to lose me, and end up like your father… You want to make that happen, you might want to take up some of what he gave you. If you're going to be like him, take the good parts."

明日香又向他展示了几下刻意追求美感的伸展动作，享受着他的注目。“你老提哲学，小心我让你学张量微积分和数论，说到做到。”她若有所思地看着他，“嗯……你不想失去我，不想落得和你父亲一样的下场……如果你想避免那种结局，或许该拾起他留给你的那些东西。若要像他，就取其精华吧。”

Shinji gave her a look of shock and disgust. "What are you talking about? Why the Hell would I want to be slightest bit like him?"

真嗣带着震惊和厌恶的表情看着她。“你在说什么？我为什么会有半点想像他那样？”

"You're going to grow up with at least part of you being a lot like where you came from. My father was an ass. I choose not to be like him. My mother was a genius. I get it from her, but I make it part of me. You… you can say your father was a lot of things, but knowing all the years of incredible focus and will it had to take to do it… you can't say he ever seemed afraid. Your father had iron will, your mother was a genius almost as good as mine… you don't get to choose your parents, Shinji, but you can own your own life. Take what you've inherited and make it your own. You can do it, Shinji. You'd better, to keep up with me." 'If I have to drag you kicking and screaming, you're coming with me from now on, Shinji. You're mine. I'm not letting you go.' She kept the pleading current of that thought far, far down. Not that there was one. No. There wasn't.

你长大后，至少有一部分会与你来自的地方相似。我父亲是个混蛋，我选择不像他。我母亲是个天才，我继承了她的才智，并将其融入自我。你……你可以形容你父亲是很多种人，但考虑到他多年来所展现的惊人专注与意志力……你不能说他曾显得害怕。你父亲意志如铁，你母亲几乎和我母亲一样是天才……你无法选择父母，真嗣，但你可以主宰自己的人生。接受你所继承的，并将其变为自己的。你能做到，真嗣。你最好做到，才能跟上我。如果我必须拖着你，又踢又叫，从今往后，你都要跟我一起，真嗣。你是我的。我不会放你走。' 她将那恳求的思绪深埋心底，尽管那并不存在。不，没有。

She grabbed the edge of the sheet and whipped it off him. "Now hop up, Third Child. We've got places to go and worlds to save. There's an army waiting for us to lead it, glory to be won, and Mama to see before we go anywhere." She gave him a fierce grin. "And I'm not starting any of it without a well-washed back."

她抓住床单边缘，猛地一掀，将其从他身上扯下。“现在快起来，三娃子。我们有地方要去，世界要拯救。有一支军队正等着我们去领导，荣耀等着我们去赢取，还有妈妈要看望，然后才能去任何地方。”她朝他露出一个坚定的笑容。“而且，我不会在没洗干净背之前开始任何事情。”

His smile returned as he visibly banished thoughts of similarities between himself and his despised parent. "Can't have that, no. No time for breakfast in bed today, either. Guess I'll just have to make your back really clean to make up for it." He followed her into the bathroom.

他的笑容重现，明显地将他与自己所憎恶的父母之间的相似之处抛诸脑后。“不能这样，不。今天也没时间在床上吃早餐了。看来我只能把你的背擦得特别干净来补偿了。”他跟着她走进了浴室。

"That's the spirit, Third. Begin as you mean to go on. We've got an army at our back, gods on our side, and nothing is going to stand in our way." She pushed him into the shower stall ahead of her. "Now get me wet," she said with a half-grin.

这才是我的好三儿，开始就要有始有终。我们背后有军队，身边有神明，没有什么能阻挡我们。" 她推着他先走进淋浴间。"现在让我湿身吧，" 她半笑着说。

Asuka pulled the napkin from her uniform collar and tossed it onto her emptied plate and swallowed the last of her toast as she looked at her interface band. "Almost eight o'clock. Maybe we need to call for a lift?"

明日香从制服领口抽出餐巾，随手扔在已空的盘子上，咽下最后一口吐司，目光投向手腕上的界面带。“快八点了。或许我们得叫个电梯？”

Shinji collected her plate and put it in the sink with his own. "We could, but I thought they were supposed to get us around now anyway." He looked at the ceiling as he rubbed the back of his head. "I think. My memory's a little fuzzy by that point in the evening. I think I'd had at least five glasses of 'courage' by then."

绫波收起她的盘子，和自己的一起放进水槽。“我们本可以的，但我想他们本来就该在这个时候来接我们。”他一边揉着后脑勺，一边望向天花板。“我觉得。那天晚上到那会儿我的记忆有点模糊。我想那时我已经喝了至少五杯‘勇气’了。”

"Didn't affect your dancing, fortunately. Well, you call and see if we're supposed to get a ride. I'm going to see Mama again." Asuka rose and headed towards the hallway, but hadn't gotten more than a few steps when there was a knock at their door. "Or not. That's probably our ride. Leave the dishes, Third. The invisible cleaning staff will get it, I'm sure." She opened the door, revealing a tall, blonde young man smiling politely at her. He wore a dark green Imperial Army uniform like hers, but surprisingly had even fewer ribbons. After the ball last night, Asuka half-expected to see nearly everyone with a good hand's-width of ribbons and medals on their breast. This young man had just a couple, and a small pair of green-rimmed gold bars on his uniform collar.

幸好没影响你跳舞。嗯，你打电话问问我们是不是该搭车了。我再去看看妈妈。" 明日香起身朝走廊走去，没走几步就听到敲门声。"或者不用了。这应该是我们的车。放下碗筷吧，老三。隐形清洁工肯定会处理的。" 她打开门，一个高个金发青年礼貌地对她微笑。他穿着和她一样的深绿色帝国军装，但令人惊讶的是，他胸前的勋章和绶带更少。昨晚舞会之后，明日香本以为几乎每个人胸前都会挂满一手宽的勋章和绶带。而这个年轻人只有寥寥几枚，以及一对金色领边的小绿杠。

He gave her a brief salute. Asuka automatically returned it, absently grateful for years of military-related training that made it a reflex. "Good morning, ma'am. I'm Junior Second Lieutenant of the Green Thaddeus O'Brien, Imperial Army General Staff. My great-grandfather has tasked me to conduct you to the mission site whenever you are ready."

他向她简短地敬了个礼。明日香本能地回礼，心不在焉地感激多年军事训练形成的条件反射。“早上好，女士。我是帝国陆军总参谋部少尉二等兵，绿·撒迪厄斯·奥布赖恩。我的曾祖父派我来，随时待命带您前往任务地点。”

Asuka gave him a faintly suspicious look. "You people always seem to turn up at our door exactly at the right moment. You're not just loitering outside waiting for your cue or something, are you?"

明日香给了他一个略带怀疑的眼神。"你们这些人总是恰好在关键时刻出现在我们门前。你们不会是一直在外面徘徊，等着时机出现吧？"

The new Lieutenant looked a little confused. "Ah, no, ma'am. My great-grandfather just said to show up no earlier than this time to escort you. He was pretty specific, but didn't mention why."

新来的中尉看起来有些困惑。“啊，不，女士。我的曾祖父只是说不要早于这个时间来护送您。他非常明确，但没提为什么。”

Asuka's eyes narrowed further. "Did he now? Your great-grandfather, I assume, is a certain Emperor?"

明日香的眼睛眯得更细了。“是吗？我猜，你的曾祖父就是那位皇帝吧？”

"Yes, ma'am, he is." 是的，夫人，他正是。

"Your great-grandfather is the Lord of the whole Empire, and you're a Lieutenant so junior even I outrank you?" Asuka said with mild amusement.

你的曾祖父是整个帝国的君主，而你却只是个连我都比你军衔高的低级中尉？" 飞鸟带着几分戏谑地说道。

"I only just started my term of service, ma'am. Even a Prince Of The Blood doesn't start except at the bottom, and has to serve to earn his Citizenship. And I'd be a very poor reflection on the Family if I didn't. That's why I'm assigned to the General Staff as an unattached aide, which is a more dignified title than 'gopher', if the same in essence. It's a good place to see a variety of situations and learn the ropes. And why I'm here today, as well. I'm a low-level gopher who's also good enough in my powers to serve as an unassisted courier for a pair of new Auxiliary Officers with a meeting to catch and a campaign to start." He smiled. "Plus I've got a couple of dispatches to courier to His Majesty for the IAGS. So at your pleasure, ma'am, we can depart. You'll have to step outside, though. My control's not quite good enough yet to be reliably used indoors in a building this small."

我才刚开始我的服务期，女士。即便是皇室血脉的王子，也得从基层做起，通过服务来赢得公民身份。如果我做得不好，那对家族来说就是个很差的映像。这就是为什么我被分配到总参谋部担任未定岗的副官，虽然本质上与“跑腿”无异，但头衔更为体面。这里能接触到各种情况，学习门道。这也是我今天在这里的原因。我是个低级别的跑腿，但我的能力足以独立为两位新任辅助军官担任信使，他们有会议要赶，有战役要启动。"他微笑着说，"另外，我还有几份急件要递交给国王陛下，供国际联合参谋部使用。所以，女士，您准备好了我们就可以出发。不过您得走到外面去，我的控制力还不够稳定，在这类小建筑内使用还不太可靠。"

Asuka looked back over her shoulder. Shinji nodded from just behind her. She turned back to their new guest. "Let's head out, then. Time for us to save our world."

明日香回头望了一眼，身后的真嗣点头示意。她转回面对新来的客人，说道：“那我们就出发吧，是时候去拯救我们的世界了。”

Lieutenant O'Brien nodded and led them a short distance out onto the beach. He stopped, raised his hand chest high out in front of him, and closed his eyes. After a brief silence, another pitch-black portal slowly irised open in front of them. He stepped to the side and waved for them to precede him through.

奥布赖恩中尉点头示意，带领他们向海滩走了一段距离。他停下脚步，将手举至胸前，闭上眼睛。片刻沉默后，一个漆黑的传送门缓缓在前方展开。他侧身一步，挥手示意他们先行通过。

They emerged on the other side into the mist and nighttime cool of the Pampas. Asuka instantly picked out the welcome and pleasing silhouette of her wonderful new toy in the still dark sky. Red Whirlwind wore a faint coat of dew, indicating it had been waiting for her a little while. Asuka looked closer, noting a handful of figures working around the feet of the immense mecha at some mysterious support machinery. She could see a little less clearly the much smaller shapes of two other mecha in the distance behind hers. 'Jock-Stooge and Geek-Stooge's mechas, maybe? Bah, mine's still far bigger and better, and those two cherries aren't going to do more than make me look even better when they start stumbling around,' she thought dismissively.

他们穿越而出，进入了潘帕斯草原的薄雾与夜凉之中。明日香立刻在静谧的夜空中辨认出了她那美妙新玩具的迷人轮廓。红色旋风披着一层淡淡的露水，表明它已在此等候她片刻。明日香凝神细看，注意到几个身影在巨型机甲的脚下忙碌着，围绕着某种神秘的辅助机械。她隐约能看见远处还有两台体型较小的其他机甲。是乔克-斯托和极客-斯托的机甲吗？哼，我的依然更大更出色，那两个新手除了在我开始行动时显得更加笨拙外，别无他用，她不屑地想道。

"Greetings, Starfighter! You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada! Are you ready to begin?" Daniel said cheerily from behind them.

"你好，星际战士！你已被星际联盟征召，保卫边境免受徐尔和科丹舰队的侵袭！准备好开始了吗？" 丹尼尔在他们身后欢快地说道。

Shinji and Asuka turned and looked at him in complete confusion. "What?" they said in perfect unison.

真嗣和明日香转过身来，满脸困惑地看着他。“什么？”他们异口同声地说道。

"Never saw that one either? Kids these days, no classical education, I swear…" Daniel sighed and shook his head at them. "Good morning, Lieutenants. You're the last to arrive of your gang. Sergeant Bir already has your support section and gear up and running. He's got your whole 'pit crew' here and ready to rock before anyone else in the entire 791st Division has even set up the commander's coffee maker. I think he's trying to impress us." He looked down from the glistening red StarStrider to examine the two young Pilots more closely, a grin growing on his face. "And you two seem like you passed a very pleasant night. Get any sleep?"

"也没见过那个吗？现在的孩子，一点古典教育都没有，我敢说……" 丹尼尔叹了口气，对他们摇了摇头。"早上好，中尉们。你们是你们那伙人中最后到的。比尔军士已经让你们的支援分队和装备运转起来了。他把你们整个'维修团队'都召集到这里，准备就绪，比整个 791 师任何人都早，甚至连指挥官的咖啡机都还没架好。我看他是想给我们留下深刻印象。" 他从闪亮的红色星际飞船上俯视下来，更仔细地打量着两位年轻的飞行员，脸上露出了笑容。"你们俩看起来像是度过了一个非常愉快的夜晚。睡得好吗？"

They blinked at him for a moment before it hit them. Shinji turned the same color as Asuka's mecha. Ching, standing behind and to Daniel's right, grinned and started coughing to cover her laugh at Shinji's sudden flush.

他们愣愣地看了他一会儿，才恍然大悟。真嗣的脸色变得和明日香的机甲一样红。站在丹尼尔右后方的小青咧嘴一笑，开始咳嗽以掩饰对真嗣突然脸红的笑声。

'Oh Gott, is it written all over my face or something?' Asuka wondered as she struggled to keep her face from going as red as Shinji's. She blinked in surprise again, at herself this time. As much as she was trying not to blush as red as her fellow Pilot, she found herself at the same time wearing a defiant grin right back at Daniel and Ching. She was embarrassed, yes, but she was also feeling the urge to trumpet the news to everyone. 'He's mine! I claimed him! And it was great!' Asuka lifted her chin in a faint imitation of her old arrogant Prima Donna Pilot attitude and met his look. "Ah, yes, we did get some sleep. It was a very nice night. A most entertaining ball."

哦，天哪，难道这一切都写在我脸上了吗？' 明日香一边努力不让自己的脸变得像真嗣那样通红，一边暗自思忖。她再次惊讶地眨了眨眼，这次是对自己。尽管她极力避免像同伴驾驶员那样脸红，却发现自己同时对丹尼尔和青露出了挑衅的笑容。她确实感到尴尬，但同时也迫不及待地想要向所有人宣告这个消息：他是我的！我拥有了他！而且感觉棒极了！明日香微微抬起下巴，模仿着昔日傲慢的首席驾驶员姿态，迎上了他的目光。"啊，是的，我们确实睡了一会儿。那是个非常美好的夜晚。一场极为有趣的舞会。"

"And there was a pretty good party at Fort Schelbert, too," Ching quietly snarked as Daniel chuckled and excused himself to talk to their escort. Ching cocked her head as she regarded the two of them. "So, should I give you that high five now, miss conquering heroine? Or did he make you ask nicely? Oh, and how was he?" she added with a wicked grin.

"在谢尔伯特堡也有个挺不错的派对呢。"青轻声讽刺道，丹尼尔轻笑一声，借口去和他们的向导交谈。青歪着头打量着他们俩，"那么，现在要给你这位征服女英雄一个击掌吗？还是他让你礼貌地请求了？哦，他怎么样？"她坏笑着追问。

"Ching!" Asuka squawked at her, but subsided. "Are we that obvious?" she asked more quietly.

"哐！"阿苏卡对她尖叫了一声，但随即安静下来。"我们这么明显吗？"她压低声音问道。

"Well, His Majesty knows because it happened on Avalon, and therefore he knows about it. And what he said and your reactions made it easy for me to figure it out. Congratulations, by the way. You both look so damn happy I'm envious all over again. You two both needed last night, I think. You're practically glowing, and giving off a cloud of very specific pheromones so powerful I'm practically getting a contact high from standing downwind of you. Every Imperial here is going to be able to tell because of things like that. There's also the hundred subtle cues of posture, facial expression, and body language that tell say, trained psychiatrists, for example, that things between you two are different from yesterday." Ching's smile curled up on one side. "Like the fact you two haven't let go of each other since you arrived." She gestured at their hands.

嗯，陛下知道是因为这事发生在阿瓦隆，所以他对此了如指掌。他所说的话以及你们的反应让我很容易就猜到了。顺便恭喜你们，看你们俩幸福得让人又羡慕了。我想你们俩昨晚都得到了所需。你们现在简直是容光焕发，散发出的特定费洛蒙强烈到我站在下风处都能感受到那种愉悦。这里的每个帝国人都能通过这些迹象察觉到。还有那些细微的姿态、表情和肢体语言，比如受过训练的精神科医生就能看出，你们俩之间的关系和昨天不一样了。"青的笑容歪向一边，"就像你们俩自从来到这里就没放开过彼此的手。"她指了指他们的手。

Asuka looked down, registering for the first time that she and Shinji were tightly holding hands. When had they done that? She also found herself curiously unwilling to let go, but eventually forced herself to. She didn't want to give too much away to Misato and their friends until she'd decided how much she wanted to tell, and how.

明日香低头一看，第一次注意到她和真嗣正紧紧握着对方的手。他们是什么时候这样做的？她发现自己竟然好奇地不愿放手，但最终还是强迫自己松开了。在她决定要透露多少以及如何透露之前，她不想让美里和朋友们察觉太多。

Daniel rejoined them, trailed by the young Lieutenant. "I'm going to have to pop back to the Empire for a little while. The General Staff has a situation that requires my particular attention and power. Let me link you up with your support crew before I head off, so you can get set up for your insertion back to the UN fleet and the means for slipping away undetected between now and their arrival in the area in a couple of months."

丹尼尔带着年轻的副官重新加入他们，说道：“我得回帝国一趟，时间不会太长。总参谋部有个情况需要我特别关注和处理。在我离开前，我会帮你们联系支援团队，这样你们就可以准备潜回联合国舰队，并在接下来的几个月里，直到他们抵达该区域之前，找到不被察觉的逃离方法。”

They fell in behind him as they headed towards the structure that had been raised near the base of Red Whirlwind. It would have looked like a decently sized aircraft hangar if it hadn't been so far overshadowed by the 80 meter tall mecha. Inside they found dozens of Imperial Army soldiers working at setting up more indecipherable machinery and huge cases of unknown supplies, some moving the shipping-container-sized boxes around by themselves with the help of man-sized power armor they wore.

他们紧随其后，朝着红旋风基地附近搭建的结构物前进。若非那 80 米高的机甲过于庞大，这建筑本可被视为一座大小适中的飞机库。内部，数十名帝国军士兵正忙碌着安装更多难以辨认的机械设备和未知物资的巨大箱子，其中一些人借助身穿的成人大小动力装甲，独自搬运着集装箱大小的箱子。

They approached a small command pit centered around a waist-high table, the top of which was entirely one large display screen, at the moment showing a diagram of the UN fleet at anchor in and around Marseille's harbor. Looking up as they approached, Asuka was distantly amused to watch Sergeant Bir's eyes widen and him snap to the most rigid position of attention she'd ever seen. "Sir!"

他们走近一个围绕着齐腰高桌子的小指挥坑，桌面上完全是一块巨大的显示屏，此刻正展示着联合国舰队在马赛港内外停泊的图示。随着他们的接近，明日香抬头望去，远远地看到中士比尔的眼睛瞪大，并以她所见过的最僵硬的立正姿势迅速站好。“长官！”

"Carry on, Sergeant. Your Pilots have arrived, and I'm putting them in your hands for the moment. I've got to drop back to Avalon for a short while, so until I get back or the rest of the Division staff arrives, Lieutenant Sohryu is in command, with Lieutenant Ikari as her second." He gave Ching a slightly apologetic nod. "You outrank them and you're more senior, Lieutenant Leibshott, but this is their operation."

继续吧，中士。你的飞行员已经到了，现在我把他们交给你。我得暂时回阿瓦隆一趟，所以在我回来或师部其他人到达之前，少尉惣流将担任指挥，碇少尉作为她的副手。”他对青木略带歉意地点了点头，“你军衔比他们高，资历也更深，莱布施特少尉，但这是他们的行动。”

Ching shrugged, not at all discommoded. "This is an Army show, sir. I'm here as a volunteer, friend, and doc, not as a naval officer. And it's your Empire. You could put a purple-arsed baboon in command, and I'd just salute."

青耸了耸肩，丝毫不觉尴尬。“这是陆军的事，长官。我来这里是以志愿者、朋友和医生的身份，并非海军军官。而这是您的帝国。您就算任命一个屁股紫红的狒狒当指挥官，我也只会敬礼。”

"Duly noted; I'll make sure your next commanding officer is an unusually colored simian, just for you,' he dryly replied. "Sergeant Bir, brief the Pilots on their transport pad setup, and get them situated. We've only got a bit more than two hours before someone will likely come looking for them, so they'll have to be in their tent before that. We've got a whole world to rescue without casualties to the fullest extent possible, per Lieutenant Ikari's wishes. Thereafter, give them all the support they need for their mission."

“记下了；我会确保你下一任指挥官是一只颜色异常的猿猴，专为你准备，”他干巴巴地回答道。“比尔中士，向飞行员们简要说明他们的运输平台设置，并安置好他们。我们只剩下两个多小时，之后就可能会有人来找他们，所以他们必须在那之前进入帐篷。我们要尽最大可能，按照伊卡里中尉的意愿，拯救整个世界，避免任何伤亡。之后，为他们提供执行任务所需的一切支持。”

"We'll have them briefed and in place with time to spare, sir!"

"我们会让他们提前做好准备并就位，长官！"

Daniel regarded him with some amusement before asking, "Sergeant, if I ordered you to relax, would the paradox make you spontaneously combust?"

丹尼尔带着几分戏谑地看着他，然后问道：“中士，如果我命令你放松，这种悖论会不会让你自燃呢？”

"Only if you ordered me to, sir!" Sergeant Bir responded in the same rigidly energetic tone, but a faint smile at least snuck its way onto his face.

"只有您命令我，长官！" 比尔中士以同样刚劲有力的语气回应，但至少一丝微笑悄悄爬上了他的脸庞。

"Lieutenant Leibshott, if Sergeant Bir does catch fire, do please put him out."

“莱布肖特中尉，如果比尔中士真的着火了，请务必帮他灭火。”

"Aye aye, sir. I'll stand by to hose him down thoroughly," Ching said brightly.

"是，长官。我会准备好彻底给他冲洗一番，" 青说得很是爽快。

Daniel raised an eyebrow at this, but held his commentary to, "You haven't been at sea that long, Lieutenant."

丹尼尔对此扬了扬眉毛，但只是评论道：“中尉，你还没在海上待那么久。”

He shook his head. "Anyhow, Lieutenant Sohryu, Lieutenant Ikari, you have command until relieved. I've got to go back to settle this peculiar situation, but I'll see you as soon as I can return." He looked up at the ceiling with a slightly troubled expression. "And I'll try to figure out what Ayanami-san is doing. She's been very …deliberately blank all morning, and she doesn't feel very happy with us to me right now. Something's not right."

他摇了摇头。“无论如何，碇中尉，明日香中尉，你们暂时负责指挥。我得回去处理这个特殊情况，但我会尽快回来见你们。”他抬头望向天花板，脸上带着些许忧虑。“我也会试着弄清楚绫波在做什么。她今天一早上都显得特别……刻意地冷漠，而且她现在给我的感觉是对我们不太满意。肯定有什么不对劲。”

Asuka waved her hand. "Wondergirl's in a snit because she doesn't like me and Shinji being together. So what? I'm happy, Shinji's happy, and if she doesn't like that she can deal with it."

明日香挥了挥手：“绫波心情不好，因为她不喜欢我和真嗣在一起。那又怎样？我开心，真嗣也开心，她要是不喜欢，自己解决去。”

"Hmm, careful, Lieutenant Sohryu. Ayanami-san may be personally not happy with you, but when she's pretty much a local god, that can have bigger effects than just a tiff with your boyfriend's sister," Daniel said as he stared at the display table, a gesture shifting it to a map of the River Plate Estuary. "The rest of the Division elements should begin arriving soon. Sergeant Bir will show you what you need to get re-inserted to the UN fleet before anyone notices you've gone wandering. I'll be back as soon as I can. Someone needs a smiting, and I'm the one who needs to administer it. Lieutenant O'Brien? Let's get back."

“嗯，小心点，碇真嗣中尉。绫波丽小姐可能对你个人有些不满，但当她几乎成了当地的神明时，这带来的影响可不仅仅是和你男友的妹妹闹别扭那么简单。”丹尼尔一边说着，一边盯着显示屏，手势一挥将其切换成拉普拉塔河口的地图。“其他分队成员应该很快就会到达。比尔中士会带你了解如何重新融入联合国舰队，以免有人发现你曾擅自离开。我会尽快回来。有人需要受到惩罚，而我就是执行者。奥布赖恩中尉？我们回去吧。”

The young officer nodded, and a portal opened behind him out in the more open area of the hangar, away from the more crowded command pit. The Emperor and his great-grandson stepped into the brilliant gold light just as another shadow stepped back out of it.

年轻的军官点头示意，在他身后，机库中较为开阔的地带开启了一道传送门，远离了拥挤的指挥区。皇帝和他的曾孙刚踏入那耀眼的金光中，另一个身影便从光中退了出来。

Part 45 第 45 章

Dragonfly 蜻蜓

When the portal snapped closed, a gold-furred felinoid in a khaki Marine uniform blinked several times before darting a glance back over his shoulder. "Hey, was that just…"

当传送门啪的一声关闭时，一个身着卡其色海军制服、金色毛发的猫科生物眨了几下眼睛，然后迅速回头瞥了一眼。“嘿，那刚刚是……”

"Yes, that was our Lord and sovereign you just passed, and didn't even salute. Tisk tisk, jarhead. Now, what are you doing in my nice clean command post, Marine?" Sergeant Bir deadpanned at him.

"没错，你刚经过的是我们的主上和国王，连个礼都没敬。啧啧，愣头青。那么，你在我这整洁的指挥所里做什么，陆战队员？" 比尔中士面无表情地对他说道。

"Great, that's going to look good… Corporal Vasraith, HMS Saragarhi Marine Detachment, Sergeant. I'm looking for Flight Lieutenant Leibshott. Senior Fleet Captain Singh sent me as a courier for her leave packet and a message for her."

太好了，这看起来会很不错……瓦斯拉斯下士，HMS 萨拉加里号海军陆战队分遣队，中士。我在找莱布施托特飞行中尉。高级舰队上尉辛格派我来给她送休假包裹和一条口信。

Ching stuck her hand up. "Right here, Corporal. You've found me. What's the Skipper got for me? You going to be my personal Marine detail while I'm away?"

青举起手说：“就在这儿，下士。你找到我了。上尉有什么吩咐？你会在我外出期间担任我的私人海军陆战队护卫吗？”

Asuka's attention was pulled away by a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see one of the more hideous things she'd ever seen, and that was a tall order given her last few years; a positively beaming Kensuke Aida in uniform, giving her a sharp salute so firm he was nearly vibrating.

明日香的注意力被肩膀上的一下轻拍吸引过去。她转过身，看到了她有生以来见过的最丑陋的东西之一，考虑到她过去几年的经历，这可真是个高难度的挑战；那是穿着制服、正灿烂笑着的相田剑介，他坚定地向她敬了一个礼，力度之大几乎让他整个人都在颤抖。

"Junior Second Lieutenant of the Green Aida reporting for duty, commander!" he nearly squealed at her.

"绿艾达二等兵向指挥官报到！" 他几乎尖声对她喊道。

"Oh for Gott's sake…number one, we're indoors, you don't have to salute, idiot. Number two… just… stop." Asuka felt a bizarre headache starting. "Or I'll have you court-martialed for being a Stooge."

“哦，看在上帝的份上……第一，我们在室内，你不必敬礼，白痴。第二……就……停下。”明日香感到一种奇怪的头痛开始发作。“否则我会因为你是个小丑而把你送上军事法庭。”

"I'm finally a mecha pilot! I'm living my greatest dream! How can I contain myself?" he said with undaunted cheer. He finally dropped the salute.

我终于成为机甲驾驶员了！我正活在我最大的梦想中！我怎能抑制住自己的激动？" 他带着无畏的喜悦说道。他终于放下了敬礼。

"It ain't all it's cracked up to be, Kensuke. You'll learn that pretty fast. I just hope not the way I did. C'mon, you remember how much it sucked for Shinji when we saw him in the Entry Plug, right?" Touji chimed in from behind him, Hikari following close behind as they walked up.

这并不像传闻中那么美好，健介。你很快就会明白的。我只希望你不是以我那样的方式。来吧，你还记得我们看真嗣在插入栓里的样子有多糟糕吧？” 后藤从后面插话，而光紧随其后，他们一起走了上来。

"My Black Knight has a giant plasma cannon! Your argument is invalid!"

我的黑骑士装备了巨型等离子炮！你的论点无效！

Asuka fought down the urge to hit herself in the face until he disappeared. "Shinji, please find a way to cool geek-Stooge down before I take der Roter Wirbelsturm out and step on him?"

明日香强忍着扇自己一巴掌的冲动，直到他消失。“真嗣，拜托你找个办法让那个书呆子冷静下来，不然我就要拿出红色旋风，踩扁他了？”

"Yes, Asuka," he said with a small smile. Shinji took Kensuke by the shoulder and led him away from Asuka, Touji trailing them.

"是的，明日香，" 他带着一丝微笑说道。真嗣抓住了健介的肩膀，将他带离了明日香，而东治则跟在他们后面。

Asuka's incipient headache faded a little as she took in the site of her former Class Representative and close friend in a dark green uniform like her own. "I know you're not going to be a Pilot, Hikari, but have you figured out what you are going to be doing on this mission?"

当明日香看到她曾经的班长兼密友穿着和自己一样的深绿色制服时，她初起的头痛似乎减轻了一些。“我知道你不会成为驾驶员，光，但你有没有想好这次任务中你要做什么？”

Hikari nodded. "I'm a pretty good cook, so I can help out there, and Ching...er, I mean Lieutenant Leibshott has offered to teach me as a nurse on the medical side. I figure we'll have some chance to do more good than fighting for the people on our Earth that way. I'm still having a hard time coming to grips with how horrible it's been since…um…"

光点了点头。“我厨艺还不错，可以在那方面帮忙，还有，呃，我是说莱布肖特中尉，他提出要教我做医护工作。我想这样我们或许能比直接战斗为地球上的人们做更多好事。自从……呃……以来，我一直难以接受这糟糕的现实。”

"Since the end of the world and everything that came after. I understand, Hikari." 'Though I doubt you ever will. Not that I'll hold that against you. I wouldn't want anyone I know to have to live through what Shinji and I did.' Asuka pushed away a torrent of unpleasant memories with a well-worn flicker of will. No more of that. Time to fight back.

"自从世界末日以及之后的一切发生以来，我明白了，光。" 尽管我怀疑你永远不会明白。并不是我会因此责怪你。我不希望我认识的任何人不得不经历真嗣和我所经历的。" 明日香用一种久经磨练的意志力，推开了一波不愉快的回忆。不再去想那些了。是时候反击了。

"Well, yesterday afternoon, after I had…" Hikari paused to blush. "Um… introduced Touji to my father and… I still can't believe I can even say this now, to my mother, Lieutenant Leibshott had me sit in one of those NILS chairs, and taught me a basic nursing course. I mentioned how Touji had been injured, and she suggested it as something I could do besides Piloting like you and the boys. It's really weird to have all that knowledge in my head like I just dumped a book in there, but I think I could do it."

昨天下午，在我……"光停顿了一下，脸颊泛红，"呃……把冬二介绍给了我的父亲，还有……我到现在都不敢相信我能说出这些，我的母亲，莱布施特中尉让我坐进了 NILS 椅，并教了我基础护理课程。我提到了冬二受伤的事，她建议我可以做这个，除了像你和男生们那样驾驶。感觉脑袋里突然塞满了知识，就像刚把一本书倒进去一样奇怪，但我觉得我能行。

"I am very sure you can, Lieutenant Horaki. You've got the perfect combination of iron authority and compassion that makes a good bedside manner for a nurse," Ching said as she rejoined them. "You'll do great."

“我非常确信你能行，堀崎中尉。你拥有铁一般的权威与同情心的完美结合，这对护士来说是一种极佳的床边态度，”青说，她重新加入了他们。“你会做得很好的。”

Hikari stared in amazement at the six-limbed felinoid Marine following Ching. The Imperial Navy Pilot took advantage of Hikari's distraction to lean closer to Asuka. "Have you told her?" she quietly asked. When Asuka shook her head, Ching added, "You might want to before she sees you two together and figures it out. She's pretty observant about such things, if I recall right."

光惊讶地盯着紧随青之后的六肢猫科类海军陆战队员。帝国海军飞行员趁光分神之际，悄悄靠近明日香。“你告诉她了吗？”她轻声问道。见明日香摇头，青补充道：“你或许该在她看到你们俩在一起并自己猜出来之前说清楚。我记得她对这类事情挺敏锐的。”

"I know," Asuka hissed back. 'But I think I'll prepare the ground a bit before I charge right in.' "Hey, Hikari, you and Joc-…ah, Suzuhara looked pretty cozy when you left the ball last night together. Have a fun evening?" she ever-so-sweetly inquired of her friend.

"我知道，"明日香低声回应。"但我想在直接冲进去之前先铺垫一下。" "嘿，光，你和乔斯...啊，和铃原昨晚一起离开舞会时看起来挺亲密的。晚上玩得开心吗？" 她极其甜美地向朋友询问。

Hikari blushed again, and put a hand over her mouth to try to hide her smile. "Um… yes, we did. We went back to our cabin and… umm… talked a lot."

光再次脸红了，她用手捂住嘴试图掩饰自己的笑容。“嗯……是的，我们确实去了。我们回到小屋，然后……嗯……聊了很多。”

"'Talked', hmm?" Asuka said with an evil smirk. "Touji a persuasive 'talker'?" 'You 'talked', huh? I guess that means I sang opera! Ha!'

"‘谈过’，嗯？”明日香带着邪恶的笑容说，“东治是个有说服力的‘谈话者’？你‘谈过’了？那我猜这意味着我唱过歌剧了！哈！”

"Asukaaaaa!" Hikari wailed. "You are being mean… and why are you smiling like that?"

"阿苏卡！"光悲鸣道，"你太坏了……为什么还笑得那么诡异？"

'Uh oh. Caught.' Asuka shot a look at Ching, who had gone admirably stone-faced, but a plain 'told-you-so' vibe came off her new friend. "Uh, no reason."

'哎呀，被逮个正着。' 明日香瞥了一眼静，后者已经非常出色地摆出了一副面无表情的样子，但她这位新朋友身上还是明显散发出一种'早就告诉你了'的气息。"呃，没什么原因。"

Hikari looked at her sharply for a few seconds. "What is it? Did you discover Ikari-kun is a screamer too?" she joked.

光盯着她看了几秒钟，语气尖锐：“怎么了？难道你发现一辉君也是个尖叫者？”她打趣道。

'Not as much as I am!' Asuka couldn't stop her laugh, nor her huge grin that now burst across her face. 'He's mine! Oh Gott, can't wait for tonight, and we get to do it again! And again, and every night for as long as I want. Mine!'

“哪有我这么爱！”明日香忍不住笑出声来，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。他是我的！哦，上帝，迫不及待想等到今晚，我们又可以再做一次！一次又一次，只要我愿意，每个夜晚都如此。我的！

Hikari's eyes went completely wide. "OHMIGOD! Asuka did you-?!" Only Asuka's desperately fast hand clamped over Hikari's mouth halted further extremely loud squeals from pouring out of her friend's mouth.

光的眼眸瞪得溜圆，“天哪！明日香，你难道——？！”幸亏明日香急速伸手紧紧捂住了光的嘴巴，才阻止了她那即将爆发的尖叫声从口中倾泻而出。

'I can keep my thoughts a secret from Winthrop and Jinnai for years, yet can't keep Hikari from figuring out Shinji and I are actually sleeping together in more than just the literal sense for even five minutes. Some poker face I've got.' "Hikari, I do not want the whole world to know until I know what I want to say about it," Asuka tried to turn her best threatening growl on her friend, but she kept running into her own broad smile. "Yes, Shinji and I… did a little more than 'talk'. I asked him to promise me something. He did. And then… we did."

我能将心思对温思罗普和神奈保密多年，却连五分钟都瞒不过光，让她察觉到我和真嗣不仅仅是字面意义上的同床共枕。我这副扑克脸也太差劲了。"光，我不想让全世界都知道，直到我清楚自己想说什么，"明日香试图用她最具威胁性的低吼来警告朋友，但她自己那宽阔的笑容却一再阻挠。"是的，我和真嗣……不仅仅是'谈了谈'。我让他答应我一件事。他答应了。然后……我们就做了。"

"Yhhn dhhnd?!" Hikari's eyes were still incredibly wide. Asuka carefully removed her hand. Hikari took the hint, and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Um…" She turned a brilliant red. "W… what was it like?"

"Yhhn dhhnd?!" 光的眼神依旧异常睁大。明日香小心翼翼地移开她的手。光领会了暗示，将声音压低成耳语：“嗯…” 她的脸颊泛起一片绯红。“那…那是什么感觉？”

'The best night of my life.'"It was… everything you could imagine. I might owe Misato an apology for calling her disgusting for spending a whole week that way with Kaji-san in college." Asuka looked at Hikari more squarely. "So you and your Stooge haven't actually done more than 'talk'?"

我一生中最美好的夜晚。”“那是……你能想象到的一切。我可能得向美里道歉，因为我曾说她与大学时的卡吉桑那样共度一整周很恶心。”明日香更直接地看着光。“所以你和你的跟班实际上还没做过比‘聊天’更多的事？”

"No!" Hikari couldn't meet Asuka's eyes anymore, and instead intensely studied her feet. "We... we've... we… um, 'talked' a lot last night, but we've never…I mean… I kept my panties on…" she finally mumbled. "We're not as adult as you and Ikari-kun… even if now you've got me thinking about it! Would you have done this at our age?"

"不！"光无法再直视明日香的双眼，转而专注地盯着自己的脚尖。"我们...我们昨晚...我们...呃，聊了很多，但我们从没...我是说...我穿着内裤的..."她终于含糊地说出口。"我们不像你和碇君那样成熟...即使现在你让我开始考虑这些了！你们在我们这个年纪会这么做吗？"

'Knowing what I know now? In a red hot minute. Hell, I even tried to get his attention back then!' "Yes. Yes, I would. Knowing how he looks at me…we were both too tangled up in our own scars back then." Asuka shook her head ruefully. "Hell, who knows what it might have changed if we had?"

现在我知道了？一秒钟都不用。天啊，我那时甚至试图引起他的注意！" "是的，是的，我会。知道他看我的眼神……我们那时都太纠结于自己的伤痕了。" 明日香苦笑着摇了摇头。"谁知道如果我们那时那样做了，一切会有什么不同呢？"

"Why didn't you? I could tell you… you both were interested in each other, at least."

你为什么不说呢？我能看出来……你们俩至少都对彼此有意思。

'Because we're both only slightly less terrified of opening up and being that close to someone now than we were four years ago? Because now we've already lived through Hell, madness, and the end of the world and thereby had our priorities reset? Because…' "It was in the middle of a war. We…" 'I tried. He missed it because he's a dense baka who can't pick up on anything less subtle than a brick to the head. And I'm… I'm…' "I don't want to talk about it right now."

因为我们现在对敞开心扉、与某人如此亲近的恐惧，仅比四年前稍减几分？因为如今我们已历经地狱、疯狂与世界末日，从而重置了生活的优先级？因为……”“那是在战争期间。我们……”我试图解释。他却错过了，因为他是个迟钝的笨蛋，除非是迎头一击，否则难以察觉任何微妙之事。而我……我……”“我现在不想谈论这个。”

Hikari backed off a step to look at her. "You're still happy about it, right?" she asked softly.

光往后退了一步，仔细端详着她。“你还是为此感到高兴的，对吧？”她轻声问道。

She backed off another step in surprise as Asuka hit her with an absolutely blinding smile. "He loves me, Hikari. He loves me. Every part of him is mine." Asuka blinked and looked around the command pit. "Let's go find them."

她惊讶地又后退了一步，因为明日香向她投来了一个灿烂到令人目眩的笑容。“他爱我，光。他爱我。他的每一部分都属于我。”明日香眨了眨眼，环顾指挥室。“我们去找他们吧。”

Hikari smiled herself. "Missing him already?" she asked with just a hint of teasing in her voice.

光自己笑了笑。“已经开始想他了？”她问道，声音中带着一丝戏谑。

'Yes.' "No, I just want to make sure those other two numbskulls haven't gotten him into more trouble. He always does when he's out of my sight. Come on." She tugged Hikari after her. She vaguely sensed Ching, Sergeant Bir, and the new Marine fall in behind her as they headed for the main door of the building.

是的。”“不，我只是想确认那两个笨蛋没有让他陷入更多麻烦。他一离开我的视线就会这样。快点。”她拉着光跟在后面。她隐约感觉到青、伯尔中士和新来的海军陆战队员跟在她后面，一起朝大楼的主门走去。

Waiting there were her former guardians, and newly betrothed couple, Misato and Kaji. Asuka tried to school her face back from the huge smile Hikari's last question had sent it into. She didn't want to give things away that easily, especially to the woman she suspected would tease her the most mercilessly over it. She had mostly succeeded by the time Misato noticed their approach and turned around.

那里等候着的是她的前任监护人，以及新订婚的情侣，美里和加持。明日香努力将脸上因光最后一个问题而绽放的巨大笑容收敛起来。她不想这么轻易地泄露心思，尤其是对那个她怀疑会最无情地以此取笑她的女人。当美里注意到他们的接近并转过身来时，她已基本成功地控制住了表情。

Asuka did grudgingly admit in the privacy of her head that Misato did look almost as good in the dark green uniform as she did. And Kaji-san of course looked quite yummy, no matter what, even if he was now 'off the market'. She was of mixed feelings as she spotted their tight handclasp; jealousy of Misato for having what she'd once wanted, envy that they could so easily do that in public, and a small but growing current of glee that she could do that now too, if she could find the courage to overcome her embarrassment in doing something like that in front of her friends and the public at large.

明日香在内心深处不得不承认，三佐穿上那身墨绿制服的样子确实与她不相上下。而加持先生嘛，无论何时都那么迷人，尽管他现在已是“名草有主”。当她注意到他们紧握的双手时，心情复杂：既嫉妒三佐拥有她曾渴望的一切，又羡慕他们能在公众面前如此自然地表达情感，同时，一股微小却逐渐壮大的喜悦在心头涌动——如果她能鼓起勇气克服在朋友和大众面前亲昵的羞涩，她也能做到那样。

Going with her usual choice of tactics, Asuka went on the offensive. "Such shameful little displays of public affection will not be tolerated under my command, Lieutenant Katsuragi, Lieutenant Kaji! 'Not unless I get to do them first, damn it.' "Compose yourselves!"

遵循一贯的策略，明日香采取了攻势。“在我的指挥下，绝不容忍这种丢人的公开示爱行为，葛城少尉，加持少尉！除非我先来，该死。”“都给我收敛点！”

Misato gave her a raised eyebrow. "'Your' command, Asuka?"

惣流挑起了一边的眉毛。“'你的'指挥，明日香？”

"Afraid so, Lieutenant Katsuragi," Ching put in from behind Asuka. "From His Majesty's lips directly; Lieutenant Sohryu is in charge until relieved by Himself or the Division command staff arrive. Even I'm just an attachment. She's the chief for here and now."

"确实是这样，葛城中尉，"青从明日香身后插话道，"这是陛下亲口所言；直到陛下或师部指挥官到来之前，苏里尔中尉负责一切。连我也是临时附属于此。她现在是这里的负责人。"

Misato looked rather nonplussed at having her former ward's authority over her confirmed, but released her fiancé's hand and came to attention with a precise salute. "Alright then, Lieutenant Sohryu, your orders?" She kept all but the faintest trace of ironic mockery out of her voice.

美里对于自己曾经的被监护人的权威得到确认显得有些不知所措，但她还是放开了未婚夫的手，以一个精确的敬礼站直了身体。“那么，少尉相良，您的命令是什么？”她尽量让自己的声音中只留下一丝微弱的讽刺。

Asuka returned the salute and ignored the half-mocking question. "We're looking for the Stooges. Seen them recently?"

明日香回了个礼，对那半带嘲讽的问题置之不理。“我们在找斯托吉斯，最近见过他们吗？”

Misato pointed towards the closer of the two Black Knights parked beyond Red Whirlwind. The three Stooges were visible in the floodlights at the foot of the mecha, and even at this distance, Asuka could hear Kensuke excitedly describing his new mecha to Shinji. Asuka's smile broke free again, this time with a flavoring of schadenfreude. She could more than sympathize with the look of glazed anguish he wore as Kensuke expounded on his mecha's abilities at great length, even as she was glad it kept it from being aimed at her, and kept Kensuke occupied far away. But if she wanted to rescue Shinji and get him back next to her like he was supposed to be, she'd have to get within range herself.

明日香指着停在红色旋风后方的两台黑色骑士中较近的那一台。三笨蛋在机甲脚下的泛光灯中清晰可见，即使隔着这段距离，明日香也能听到剑介兴奋地向真嗣描述他的新机甲。明日香的笑容再次绽放，这次带着一丝幸灾乐祸的味道。她完全能理解真嗣在剑介长篇大论地阐述其机甲能力时所流露出的痛苦茫然，同时她也庆幸这让他无法将注意力转向自己，也让剑介无暇他顾。但如果她想救出真嗣，让他回到本应所在的她身边，她自己也必须进入有效范围。

"Careful, sister. You're smiling hard enough to give the game away," Ching said softly from just behind Asuka's shoulder, her voice amused despite her cautioning words. "I love seeing you this happy, but you'll have to play it a little cooler if you don't want her to catch on that you and Shinji are something more to each other than you were yesterday."

"小心点，姐姐。你笑得这么开心，都快露馅了。" 青从飞鸟的肩后轻声说道，尽管话语中带着提醒，但语气中却透着笑意。"我喜欢看你这么高兴，但如果你想让她不察觉你和真嗣之间的关系比昨天更进一步，你得表现得再淡定些。"

"I know," Asuka muttered back as they started to walk towards the boys. "But it's hard. I'm feeling fucking great." 'I'm too happy to stop for the first time in too long. I don't want to stop feeling like this,' Asuka realized.

"我知道，"飞鸟低声回应，两人开始向男孩们走去。"但真的很难。我现在感觉棒极了。"太久以来第一次，我太快乐了，不想停下来。飞鸟意识到，他不想失去这种感觉。

The feeling only got stronger when their party got closer. Shinji caught sight of her approaching over Kensuke's shoulder, and positively lit up, a huge smile that looked almost goofy on the Third Child's face bursting out. Asuka couldn't stop herself from answering with one of her own. She was vaguely aware she probably looked funny to the group of people who'd known the far different Asuka of the Angel War. She didn't care. His hand came up to meet hers as she got within arm's reach. She couldn't tell who'd made the first move. She just wrapped her fingers around his and they glowed at each other for a timeless instant.

当他们的队伍逐渐靠近时，这种感觉愈发强烈。真嗣透过健介的肩膀瞥见了她，顿时容光焕发，那张第三适格者的脸上绽放出几乎显得滑稽的灿烂笑容。明日香情不自禁地以自己的微笑回应。她隐约意识到，在那些熟悉天使战争中截然不同的明日香的人群看来，自己可能显得颇为有趣。但她毫不在意。当她走近到伸手可及的距离时，他的手迎了上来，与她的相触。她已分不清是谁先伸出的手，只是紧紧握住彼此的手指，在那一刻，他们彼此凝视，仿佛时间静止。

"What happened to 'no shameful little displays of public affection', oh mighty commander?" Misato asked archly.

"什么'不搞丢人的公开秀恩爱'，哦，伟大的指挥官？" 碇真嗣戏谑地问道。

'You know what, Misato? Fuck you. You're going to rub being happy with Kaji in my face? Have a little of your own medicine.' Asuka used her grip on Shinji's hand to draw him into a close embrace and wrapped her other hand around the back of his head to pull him into a deep, intense kiss. Shinji's eyes widened at the first tug on his hand, but very quickly and enthusiastically threw himself into matching her. Asuka could hear gasps of shock from her friends behind her, and smiled into the kiss. She let worrying about their reaction fade for a long moment, just enjoying herself, before she slowly pulled away.

你知道吗，美里？去你的。你要在我面前炫耀和加持的幸福？那就尝尝自食其果的滋味吧。' 明日香紧握着真嗣的手，将他拉入一个亲密的拥抱，另一只手绕到他脑后，将他拉进一个深沉而热烈的吻中。真嗣在手被拉扯的瞬间瞪大了眼睛，但很快便热情地回应起来。明日香能听到身后朋友们惊讶的吸气声，她在吻中微笑。她暂时抛开了对他们反应的担忧，尽情享受这一刻，然后才缓缓分开。

She whirled around to face the still stunned group with a triumphant smirk on her face. "Because you were doing it wrong, Lieutenant Katsuragi! That's how we do public displays of affection in this unit! No tiny, shameful hand-holding around here! I want to see big, shameless, sincere expressions of how we feel! There is no such thing as fear in my company!"

她猛地转身，面对着仍处于震惊中的众人，脸上挂着胜利的微笑。“因为你们做错了，葛城中尉！这才是我们部队表达爱意的方式！这里可不兴那种偷偷摸摸、羞于见人的牵手！我要看到的是大胆、无耻、真诚地表达我们的感情！在我的连队里，没有恐惧这个词！”

The blazing gold light from a portal opening a few dozen meters behind them washed over the still dark field and finally snapped the crowd out of its shock. Lieutenant O'Brien stepped back out and called to the group when he spotted them, "The first mecha regiments are moving out, Lieutenant Sohryu! The 315th Heavy Mechanized is coming in now! Heads up!" He pointed into the air. About a hundred meters into the sky, another, much larger portal flared open and the silver gleam of the chest of a Black Knight began to slowly edge its way through.

身后数十米处开启的传送门中迸发出的炽烈金光，照亮了依旧昏暗的田野，终于让惊呆的人群回过神来。奥布赖恩中尉再次走出传送门，一看到他们便向众人喊道：“第一批机甲部队正在出动，苏瑞中尉！第 315 重机械化部队即将抵达！注意上方！”他指向天空。在百米高空，一个更大的传送门猛然展开，一具黑骑士胸甲的银色光芒开始缓缓穿透而出。

Misato grinned as their eyes returned to ground level. "Looks like your reign of terror will be over soon, Asuka. Such a shame, I think I liked your new policy on public displays of affection." She grabbed her fiancé and gave him a kiss as thorough as the one she'd just watched Asuka give Shinji. "Mmm. So, 'how you feel', eh? Between last night and now, you seem to feel pretty good about Shin-chan all of a sudden. What's going on with you two?" Misato's eyes suddenly narrowed. "Wait, have you..?"

美里笑着，当他们的视线回到地面上时。"看来你的恐怖统治很快就要结束了，明日香。真可惜，我觉得我还挺喜欢你对公开示爱的政策。"她抓住她的未婚夫，给了他一个和刚才看到明日香给真嗣的一样深情的吻。"嗯。那么，'你感觉如何'呢？从昨晚到现在，你似乎突然对真酱感觉很好。你们俩是怎么回事？"美里的眼睛突然眯了起来。"等等，你们已经……？"

Asuka grin got even bigger. "How do I feel? I feel better than I have in years. I feel," she reached back to take his hand again. "Like Shinji is mine, until I say he can go. I'm claiming him! Until I say otherwise, Shinji is mine and mine alone!"

明日香的笑容愈发灿烂。“我怎么感觉？我感觉比这些年都要好。我感觉，”她伸手再次握住他的手，“就像真嗣是属于我的，直到我说他可以离开。我要占有他！除非我另有说法，否则真嗣就是我一个人的！”

The air went taut and shook without a sound. A strange, electric snap ran through everyone's head, gone before it could be fully perceived. Asuka watched Lieutenant O'Brien collapse to his knees, clutching at his head with his face twisting in pain. Sergeant Bir, behind Misato, was barely in better shape, his hands likewise clamped on either side of his head as he let out a anguished, "GNngg! Ah!" and struggled to stay upright. Beside Asuka, Ching put her own hands to her head and swayed badly. "Ungh… Wha… what was… ow…"

空气骤然紧绷，无声地震颤着。一股奇异的电流瞬间穿透每个人的脑海，未及完全感知便已消逝。明日香目睹奥布赖恩中尉跪倒在地，双手紧抱头部，面容因痛苦而扭曲。站在 Misato 身后的比尔军士状况稍好，但也双手紧按太阳穴，发出痛苦的呻吟：“GNngg！啊！”并竭力保持站立。在明日香身旁，青也用手捂住头，摇摇欲坠。“呃……什……什么……啊……”

There was simultaneously a tremendous CRACK and rumble like thunder in the air over their heads and seconds later a chunk of shallow-curved metal the size of a garage door slammed to the earth near them, every line on the inside of the slice glowing orange-red with heat. Asuka didn't jump too badly at the impact; it was too much like things she'd seen before involving chunks of Angel or buildings in her past battles. But she knew instantly something was very much not right. That was the front two meters of the Black Knight that had been coming through the portal. 'Where is the rest of it?!'

头顶上空同时传来一声巨响和雷鸣般的轰鸣，几秒钟后，一块浅曲面金属，大小如车库门，猛地砸在他们附近的地上，切面内侧的每条纹路都因高温而泛着橙红色的光芒。明日香并未因撞击而过分惊跳；这太像她以往战斗中遭遇的天使碎片或建筑残骸了。但她立刻意识到情况极为不妙。那正是黑骑士穿过传送门的前两米部分。其余的部分呢？！

Senior Sergeant First Class Bir was the first to recover, shaking his head like a punch-drunk boxer, but coming back upright and holding his head. He looked at the red-hot and smoking chunk of mecha and Lieutenant O'Brien struggling back to his feet with blood dripping from his nose. "Fuck," he said flatly.

高级军士长比尔第一个回过神来，他像被打懵的拳击手一样摇了摇头，随即挺直身子，手扶着脑袋。他望向那块红热冒烟的机甲残骸，以及正挣扎着站起、鼻血直流的奥布赖恩中尉，面无表情地骂了句：“该死。”

Asuka blinked away a small headache of her own. "What just happened?" She pointed at the sizzling piece of Black Knight. "I'm betting that's not supposed to have happened, so what does it mean?"

明日香眨了眨眼，驱散了自己的一点小头痛。“刚才发生了什么？”她指着那块还在滋滋作响的黑骑士残骸问道，“我敢打赌，这不该发生，这意味着什么？”

Sergeant Bir gave Asuka a very weary look. "It means I think you just got promoted, ma'am." He brought his wristband up to his mouth and touched a button. "MilNetCom, come in… MilNetCom, come in…" He paused, the comm's silence stretching for most of a minute. "Shit... Break, break, break, this is Panther Seven to all Imperial units; Dragonfly. I say again, Dragonfly. All leadership elements conduct a count, equipment check, and skill listing for the commander and send it to this push ASAP."

比尔中士向明日香投去一个非常疲惫的眼神。“这意味着，我想您刚刚晋升了，女士。”他举起手腕上的通讯器，按下一个按钮。“军网通讯，请回答……军网通讯，请回答……”他停顿了一下，通讯的沉默持续了近一分钟。“该死……紧急呼叫，紧急呼叫，紧急呼叫，这里是黑豹七号呼叫所有帝国单位；代号蜻蜓。我再说一遍，代号蜻蜓。所有指挥层级立即进行人员清点、装备检查和技能清单整理，并尽快发送至此频道。”

Asuka heard Ching hiss a curse behind her, then begin trying to raise other call signs on her own wristband. She focused on Sergeant Bir. "What do you mean? What is 'Dragonfly'?"

明日香听到青在她身后低声咒骂，随后开始尝试通过自己的腕带呼叫其他代号。她将注意力集中在比尔军士身上：“你什么意思？‘蜻蜓’是什么？”

Sergeant Bir ran his hand through is close-cropped red hair. "Code Dragonfly means we're cut off, ma'am. The portal home just slammed shut hard and fast enough to cut a Black Knight in half, I can't raise Avalon on our comms, and whatever that little wave was, it just cut all of us from mental and spiritual contact with Avalon as well. I can't feel the Empire anymore, just everyone right here. That portal wasn't closed by our people, and since it hasn't reopened already, we have to assume it can't. We're cut off, and I have no clue how long that will last."

比尔中士用手捋过他那剪得短短的红发。“代号蜻蜓意味着我们被切断了，女士。回家的传送门突然关闭得如此猛烈，足以将一名黑骑士一分为二，我无法通过通讯联系到阿瓦隆，而刚才那阵波动，它切断了我们所有人与阿瓦隆之间的心灵感应和精神联系。我再也感受不到帝国的存在，只能感受到这里的每一个人。那传送门不是我们的人关闭的，而且既然它没有重新开启，我们必须假设它无法再开启。我们被切断了，我不知道这种情况会持续多久。”

He braced to attention. "And in accordance with His Majesty's last instructions from His own lips, you are in command until relieved, Lieutenant. Orders, ma'am?"

他立刻挺直了身子。“根据陛下亲口传达的最后指示，您将指挥直到被替换，中尉。请下令，女士。”

Asuka stared at him in shock. "Scheiße!"

明日香震惊地盯着他。“该死！”

A/N: Things just got a little more complicated, didn't they?

### Chapter 25 Though I Be The Lone Survivor

-and I don't want anyone to disturb us until dinner!" Asuka shouted as she slammed and locked the door to the former 'owner's cabin' suite on the commandeered cargo ship that now served as a transport for their mostly-restored Mass Production Eva Unit.

"——还有，我不希望任何人打扰我们，直到晚餐时间！" 明日香大声喊着，砰地一声关上并锁住了那艘被征用的货船上原'主人舱'套房的门，这艘船现在被用作他们大部分已修复的量产型 EVA 机体的运输工具。

Shinji dumped the last armload of their baggage on the deck near the slightly-larger-than-Double bunk at the rear of the room and massaged his arms. Their arrival back in their beachside tent following Asuka's 'assumption of command' after they had been cut-off had been rapid; Sergeant Bir had shown them how to work the dedicated transport pad that could flicker the two of them back to the South American base site and the suite of acoustic and holographic spoofing gear to fake their presence when they were gone, then packed them off before they could be missed at the fleet assembly site. The transport pad had been disguised to look like a thick, rubber-backed rug about the size of a bathmat, so they could leave it in plain sight in their cabin. Sergeant Bir had promised he, Misato, and their other Pilots would continue to try to re-establish contact with Avalon, or failing that, come up with a new plan by the time Shinji and Asuka could get away once they had some privacy in their cabin several hours later.

真嗣将最后一抱行李扔在房间后部略大于双人床的铺位旁，揉了揉胳膊。在遭到切断联系后，明日香“接管指挥”，他们迅速返回海滨帐篷。比尔中士教会了他们如何操作专用的传送垫，能将两人瞬间送回南美基地，以及如何使用声学和全息欺骗设备，在他们离开时伪造存在感。随后，在中士的催促下，他们赶在舰队集结点被人发现之前匆匆离去。传送垫被伪装成一块厚实的橡胶背地毯，大小与浴室垫相仿，以便他们将其公然放置在舱内。比尔中士承诺，他和美里以及其他驾驶员将继续尝试与阿瓦隆重新建立联系，或者在无法实现时，制定新计划，以便真嗣和明日香几小时后在舱内获得私密空间时能够脱身。

Shinji had just enough time to turn around before he was nearly tackled onto the bunk by a flying Eva Pilot. Asuka wrapped her arms around him and clung fiercely tight. "Wha-?" Shinji blurted in surprise.

真嗣刚来得及转身，就被一个飞扑而来的 Eva 驾驶员差点撞倒在铺位上。明日香紧紧抱住他，用力地搂着。"什——？"真嗣惊讶地脱口而出。

"I just know this is going to go to Hell somehow. It always does. Something good happens, and then the world shits all over us again. You and I meet, then spend years missing each other's signals. We're beating the Angels easily, coming together as a team, and then your asshole father springs the Dummy Plug system on us. We survive the Third Impact, then get a world of thugs, rapists, and warlords. And now we finally… talk to each other, and then this… I just know something more is going to go wrong here, because this world hates us," Asuka said wearily into his chest.

"我就知道这事儿准得搞砸，总是这样。好事一发生，世界就又把我们踩在脚下。你我相遇，却多年错过彼此的信号。我们轻松击败使徒，团队凝聚力强，结果你那混蛋父亲突然祭出傀儡插入栓系统。我们挺过了第三次冲击，迎来的却是一个充斥着暴徒、强奸犯和军阀的世界。现在我们好不容易……能坦诚对话，却又遇上这档子事……我就知道，肯定还有更糟的在等着我们，因为这个世界就是容不下我们。"明日香疲惫地靠在他胸前说道。

"This world may be against us, Asuka, but I think we've already survived the worst it can do to us. What could beat the Third Impact and the last four years? At least now we've got allies, and our friends back."

这个世界或许与我们为敌，明日香，但我想我们已经挺过了它最残酷的考验。还有什么能比第三次冲击和过去四年更糟糕的呢？至少现在我们有了盟友，还有我们的朋友们回来了。

Asuka buried her face into his shirt some more. "I want to burn the last twenty-four hours in to my mind. I was happier than I've ever been, Shinji. I want to hold on to that, against whatever is coming next."

明日香将脸更深地埋进他的衬衫里。“我想把过去二十四小时的记忆烙印在脑海中。我从未如此快乐过，真嗣。我想紧紧抓住这份幸福，无论接下来要面对什么。”

His arms wrapped themselves around her back and held her close. "I'm happy too, Asuka. I meant everything I said yesterday; I'm yours. I'll be whatever you need me to be. I'm no good at doing anything for myself, but I can do things that surprise even me when it's not for me. You need me by you, to be with you and take on the world with you? I promised I would. I need you right back. I'm going to use you to push myself forward. I can do anything if it's for you. You are my fire, Asuka. You give me the heat and light I need to be more than an ember."

他的双臂环抱住她的背，紧紧拥她入怀。“我也很快乐，明日香。昨天我说的一切都是真心的；我属于你。我会成为你需要的任何样子。我为自己做事总是笨手笨脚，但当不是为了自己时，我甚至能做出连自己都惊讶的事情。你需要我陪伴在侧，与你并肩作战，共同面对世界吗？我承诺过我会。我也同样需要你。我要借助你来推动自己前进。只要是为了你，我无所不能。你是我的火焰，明日香。你给予我所需的热量与光芒，让我不止是一颗余烬。”

She pulled her face out far enough to give him a faint smile."I'm your fire, huh? Did you learn that word from Ching too?"

她把脸伸得足够远，给了他一个淡淡的微笑。“我是你的火，对吧？这个词你也是从 Ching 那儿学来的吗？”

Shinji shook his head. "What word?"

真嗣摇了摇头。“什么词？”

"An Avaloni word she mentioned the night we arrived; fieron. Means 'the fires that drive you', she said. The burn that motivates you when good sense tells you to stop or give up. So I'm yours, now?"

她在我们抵达那晚提到的一个阿瓦隆尼语词汇：fieron。意为“驱使你的火焰”，她说。那种在理智告诉你停下或放弃时，仍能激励你的燃烧。所以，我现在属于你了？

He nodded. "I like that. I guess you are. I'm going to use you to make me more like the man who can stand by you. I'm nothing, Asuka. But I can use you to make me into someone better. The reward ...my friends safe, the world without people like Jinnai or my father in charge, being with you… is everything I've ever wanted.

他点头道：“我喜欢这样。我想你是的。我要利用你，让我变得更像那个能站在你身边的人。我一无是处，明日香。但我可以利用你，让我成为更好的人。回报是……我的朋友们安全，世界上不再有像阵内或我父亲那样的人掌权，与你相伴……这就是我一直以来所渴望的一切。”

Asuka's eyes snapped with as bit of anger, matched in her voice. "Don't you ever say you're 'nothing', Shinji. You're…" She shook her head to flick a thought away. "…you're not 'nothing' to me. You have to stay with me from now on. I won't stand for a 'nothing' boyfriend, remember? Or a… a lover. So you aren't allowed to be 'nothing'. I am who I am by choice. If you say you are 'nothing', you are choosing such and then you will be. Choose better. I want you with me. You are going to be with me. You promised me you weren't going anywhere. So you better be more than 'nothing'."

明日香的目光中闪过一丝怒意，声音中也带着同样的情绪。“真嗣，你绝不能说自己‘什么都不是’。你是……”她摇了摇头，仿佛要甩掉某个念头。“……对我来说，你绝不是‘什么都不是’。从今往后，你必须留在我身边。我无法忍受一个‘什么都不是’的男朋友，记住了吗？或者说……爱人。所以你不允许成为‘什么都不是’。我是我自己选择的结果。如果你说自己‘什么都不是’，那就是你自己的选择，然后你就会变成那样。要做出更好的选择。我要你在我身边。你将会和我在一起。你答应过我，哪里都不会去。所以，你最好不只是‘什么都不是’。”

"I better be a better man, or you'll 'better' me upside the head until I am?" Shinji asked with a small smile.

“我最好变得更好，否则你会一直敲打我的脑袋直到我变好吗？”真嗣带着一丝微笑问道。

"If that motivates you, Third Child, yes." She pulled him along with her as she stepped backwards onto the disguised transport pad. "Now let's get back to our company of lost souls and find out what they've come up with." Standing close to each other, purely in order to both fit on the small pad at once, of course, Asuka tapped a button on her wristband, and the cabin was empty.

“如果这能激励你，三弟，那就好。”她一边后退踏上伪装过的传送台，一边拉着他。“现在让我们回去看看那群迷途羔羊们想出了什么办法。”为了两人能同时挤上这狭小的平台，当然只是出于这个原因，他们紧挨着站在一起。随后，明日香按下手腕带上的按钮，舱室内便空无一人。

They appeared on the matching dedicated pad in the hangar from that morning, but this time there was no bustle of activity around the mecha or people moving cargo about to lighten the atmosphere. A quick look around revealed a crowd around the command pit near them, some of them already expectantly looking over at them, waving for them to join. Shinji and Asuka walked to the side of the map table as the crowd parted to allow their nominal commander and XO to the center of the ring.

他们出现在那天早上机库中对应的专用垫上，但这次周围没有机甲旁忙碌的活动，也没有人搬运货物来活跃气氛。环顾四周，只见一群人围在附近的指挥坑旁，其中一些人已经期待地望向他们，挥手示意他们加入。真嗣和明日香走向地图桌旁，人群为他们名义上的指挥官和副指挥官让出一条通往中心的路。

Sergeant Bir looked up from staring at the map of South America displayed on the table to nod greetings to them. Ching, Misato, and the rest of their friends were spread around the inner ring around the table as well, matching grim expressions on everyone's faces. Sergeant Bir shook his head sadly and met Asuka and Shinji's gaze.

比尔中士从凝视着桌上展示的南美洲地图抬起头，向他们点头致意。青、美里以及他们的朋友们也围坐在桌子的内圈，每个人的脸上都带着同样凝重的表情。比尔中士悲伤地摇了摇头，与明日香和真嗣的目光相遇。

"Ma'am, I think our carefully crafted operational plan got completely defenestrated by this morning's event. We've been completely unable to make any kind of contact with the Empire or other friendly forces outside this worldline. We're a fragmentary unit not prepared for separate ops, cut off, out of contact with the Empire, no idea how long it will be before relief or reinforcements can reach us, trapped on an entire planet of warlords, madmen, and starving masses of desperate people, with one working StarStrider trainer mecha, two Black Knights, one hundred fifty seven personnel, all of which are equipped with mostly non-lethal gear, and two junior officers with serious combat scars and personal issues in command. The only reason I won't say 'we're fucked' is that implies we might enjoy any part of this. I don't see any reasonable alternatives to this plan we've developed in the last couple of hours."

女士，我认为我们精心制定的行动计划今早的事件中彻底被抛出了窗外。我们完全无法与帝国或其他世界线外的友军取得任何联系。我们是一支未准备独立行动的零散部队，与帝国失联，不知何时能得到援救或增援，被困在一个满是军阀、疯子和饥饿绝望民众的星球上，仅有一台能用的星际飞行者训练机甲，两台黑骑士，一百五十七名人员，且装备多为非致命性武器，指挥官是两位有着严重战斗伤痕和个人问题的年轻军官。我之所以不说“我们完蛋了”，是因为这暗示我们可能会享受其中任何一部分。我看不出有任何比过去几小时我们制定的计划更合理的替代方案。

He pressed a virtual button on the map table and the view zoomed in to a much closer map showing their base's location. A red arrow traced a path from their base deep into the Amazon Basin. "We'll abandon the base site here and retreat as far into the Amazon interior as we can manage, then dig in. We can cannibalize the powerplant in the StarStrider to give us an energy supply that we should be able to stretch out for years, and that will give us the juice to build a deep bunker we can fort up in. Hopefully, no one will notice us at all, and we can do our best impression of a pack of door-mice and hide out for years if need be while we wait for rescue."

他在地图桌上轻触虚拟按钮，画面随即放大，显示出他们基地位置的更详细地图。一条红箭头从基地出发，深入亚马逊盆地。"我们将放弃这里的基地，尽可能撤退至亚马逊腹地，然后深挖固守。我们可以拆用星际飞船上的发电厂，为我们提供能维持数年的能源，这样就有足够的电力来建造一个深入地下的堡垒，供我们坚守。希望无人察觉我们的存在，我们可以像一群胆小的老鼠一样，必要时隐藏多年，静待救援。"

Shinji grimaced, but found it hard to argue with the distasteful necessity. He stared at the map, trying to come up any other ideas. He drew a blank and looked up at Misato. The former NERV Operations Officer was one of the sharpest military minds he knew. Surely she had some more palatable alternative to mind. But no, Misato was covering her face with her hands and her shoulders were shaking. Was she crying?

真嗣皱了皱眉，却难以反驳这令人不快的必要性。他盯着地图，试图想出其他办法。然而一无所获，他抬头看向美里。这位前 NERV 作战部长是他所知最敏锐的军事头脑之一。她肯定有更可接受的替代方案吧。但并没有，美里正用手捂着脸，肩膀在颤抖。她是在哭泣吗？

Misato suddenly slumped onto the table and started pounding it with her hand, laughing hysterically. "I can't hold it! Bwhahahaahaha! Oh God, the look on your faces! Hahahaha!"

突然，葛城美里猛地趴在桌子上，用手猛拍着桌面，歇斯底里地大笑起来。“我忍不住了！哇哈哈哈哈哈！天哪，看看你们的表情！哈哈哈哈！”

Asuka glared death at her. "Misato, this isn't very fucking funny. What the Hell are you laughing at?"

明日香怒目而视，杀气腾腾。“美里，这他妈的一点也不好笑。你到底在笑什么？”

"You! I can't believe you're buying this! Hahahaha!"

"你！我真不敢相信你居然买这个！哈哈哈哈！"

Shinji looked from Sergeant Bir to Lieutenant O'Brien and the others around the table. All were suddenly grinning and laughing, his classmates less so than the Imperials, but still far from saddened. Ching was absolutely smirking at Asuka's consternation. "That's not the plan? What is, then?" he asked.

真嗣从伯尔中士望向奥布赖恩中尉以及桌边的其他人。他们突然都咧嘴笑了起来，他的同学们虽然不如帝国军官们笑得开怀，但也绝非沮丧。青对明日香的不悦显然是在偷笑。“那不是计划吗？那计划是什么？”他问道。

Sergeant Bir grinned like a wolf. "'Provide any and all support they need to assist my friends in toppling Jinnai, reestablishing peace and security, and rebuilding their world', He said. I'm a soldier of the Empire and a TrueBorn of Avalon. His Majesty gave me a mission, sir, and I will complete it. Unprepared, inadequate, cut-off unit? One hundred fifty thousand of them versus one hundred fifty seven of us? No plan, no backup, or support from home? That's no excuse! What have we got to worry about? Afraid? There is no such thing as fear. The impossible is just another challenge. And if you can't take a joke, you shouldn't have joined the Army! Heh." He chuckled darkly. "They're never going to see us coming."

比尔中士咧嘴一笑，宛如狼一般。“‘提供他们所需的一切支持，帮助我的朋友们推翻阵内，恢复和平与安全，重建他们的世界’，他说。我是一名帝国士兵，也是阿瓦隆的真生。陛下赋予了我任务，长官，我必将完成。准备不足、资源匮乏、孤立无援的部队？十五万对一百五十七？没有计划，没有后援，也没有来自家乡的支持？这些都不是借口！我们有什么好担心的？害怕？恐惧根本不存在。不可能只是另一个挑战。如果你开不起玩笑，就不该加入军队！”他阴沉地轻笑，“他们永远也料不到我们的到来。”

Asuka blinked at him. "You intend to continue a mission planned out for thousands of soldiers and your Empire on call, and take on all the warlords of South America and the UN forces with one hundred fifty seven soldiers?!"

明日香瞪大眼睛看着他。“你打算继续一个原本为数千士兵和帝国随时待命而制定的任务，用一百五十七名士兵去对抗整个南美的军阀和联合国军队？！”

Sergeant Bir nodded. "I do."

比尔中士点头道：“是的。”

Corporal Vasraith pointedly coughed "Ooh-rah!".

瓦斯雷斯下士故意咳嗽一声，喊道：“哦啦！”

Bir rolled his eyes. "Correction, I plan to do it with one hundred fifty five soldiers, one squid, and one noisy jarhead. We're going to successfully complete our mission, and not only that, we're going to do our damndest to uphold the 'Nobody Dies' restriction stipulated by Lieutenant Ikari while we're at it."

比尔翻了个白眼。“纠正一下，我计划用一百五十五名士兵、一只鱿鱼和一个吵闹的海军陆战队员来完成任务。我们不仅要成功完成任务，还要尽最大努力遵守伊卡里中尉规定的‘无人死亡’限制。”

Asuka shook her head. "That's even more impossible. You're all crazy."

明日香摇了摇头。“那更不可能了。你们都疯了。”

The shark-like grin spread even wider on Sergeant Bir's face. "No, we're Avaloni! Retreat and hide in the jungles? Ha! This is the Imperial Army!"

中士比尔那鲨鱼般的笑容咧得更开了。“不，我们是阿瓦隆尼人！撤退并躲进丛林？哈！这是帝国军队！”

Shinji shook his head in disbelief. "How? We don't have even one hundredth of what we were planned for, so how can we do this? In fact, what do we have?"

真嗣难以置信地摇了摇头。“怎么可能？我们拥有的连计划中的百分之一都不到，这要怎么进行下去？实际上，我们到底有什么？”

"One StarStrider trainer with non-lethal gear. Two Black Knight Mk. VIIs with non-lethal gear and one plasma cannon. Four Pilots, one Ops Officer, one nurse, one spy, one Navy Flight Lieutenant, one Prince Of The Blood, one jarhead, and me. A technical support platoon for the mecha, three dozen strong, gives us a good technological base for making friends around here. A signal platoon, fourteen strong, that can do computer and communication network infiltration and subversion. A medical platoon, capable of running up to a Class II MASH, also very good for winning friends and influencing people. Supply platoon, three dozen strong. Psi Ops platoon, one dozen operators. They're going to be key to our plans. A Scout platoon, two dozen Scouts in light power armor, our only other actual frontline combat section. And a hardboiled egg, honk. We might also have a partridge in a pear tree in one of the boxes of supplies, I'll have to check. We obviously can't do the broad program of 'shock and awe' we were templated for that Lieutenant Katsuragi showed us, so force majeure is out. We're going to have to go with far more subtle techniques like extensive use of hypnosis, targeting key leaders with psionics, smaller piece-by-piece taking of territory, and getting a good portion of the local population actively on our side."

一架配备非致命装备的星际行者训练机。两架配备非致命装备及一具等离子炮的黑骑士 Mk. VII。四名飞行员，一名作战官，一名护士，一名间谍，一名海军飞行中尉，一名王室血脉，一名海军陆战队员，还有我。一个三十六人的技术支援排，为我们在此地结交朋友提供了坚实的技术基础。一个十四人的信号排，擅长计算机与通信网络的渗透与颠覆。一个能运营至二级移动陆军外科医院的医疗排，同样利于赢得人心与影响他人。一个三十六人的补给排。一个十二人的心灵特工排，他们将是计划实施的关键。一个二十四人、身着轻型动力装甲的侦察排，我们唯一的另一前线战斗单位。还有一颗硬煮蛋，呜呼。或许补给箱中还藏有一只鹧鸪在梨树上，我得查查。显然，我们无法执行加津美中尉展示的那种大规模“震慑与敬畏”计划，因此不可抗力策略已不可行。 我们将不得不采用更为微妙的技术，如广泛运用催眠术、针对关键领袖使用心灵感应、逐步蚕食领土，以及争取相当一部分当地民众积极支持我们。"

"Not very much for taking on the whole world with," Asuka noted.

"用来挑战全世界，似乎不太够呢。"明日香评论道。

"Could be worse, ma'am." Sergeant Bir replied. "If this was an Imperial Ranger First Class Final Certification Exam, the Ranger would be expected to do what we're aiming for by themselves, with absolutely no beginning support. They usually start tied-up naked in the middle of a desert or something, in fact. This kind of situation is what they do regularly, albeit with the Empire on call for assistance. We're starting off a little better. And as you demonstrated during that coup you and Lieutenant Ikari headlined, it doesn't matter if the UN has 150,000 troops on paper if they can only bring a small portion to bear at once, and we've got mecha support on hand that far outstrips what you had to work with."

"情况可能更糟，女士。" 比尔中士回答道，"如果这是帝国游骑兵一级最终认证考试，游骑兵将被要求独立完成我们的目标，完全没有任何初始支援。实际上，他们通常一开始就被赤身裸体地绑在沙漠中央之类的地方。这种情形是他们常规训练的一部分，尽管帝国随时提供援助。我们的起点已经算不错了。正如您和伊卡里中尉在政变中所展示的那样，如果联合国在纸面上有 15 万兵力，却只能一次性投入一小部分，那么这些数字并无意义，而我们手头的机甲支援远超您当时所拥有的。"

He tapped a few more buttons on the map table, and the view swept in to a closer shot of Buenos Aires. "We've worked up a couple of approaches while you've been setting the scene for everyone to think you're aboard the UN fleet, but they all start with Buenos Aires. The question for you and Lieutenant Ikari, ma'am, is what sort of approach you want to go with for at least the initial movements; stealthy, aliens, or angels."

他在地图桌上又轻敲了几个按钮，画面随即拉近至布宜诺斯艾利斯的特写。“在你为让大家相信你已登上联合国舰队而布局的同时，我们已制定了几个方案，但它们都以布宜诺斯艾利斯为起点。女士，您和碇中尉需要决定的是，至少在初期行动中，你们希望采取哪种方式：隐秘行动、外星人介入，还是天使降临。”

"...You're going to have to explain that part, Sergeant," Asuka said after a puzzled pause.

"...你得解释一下那部分，中士，" 明日香在困惑的停顿后说道。

At Sergeant Bir's nod, Ching spoke up. "We're going to pick up the whole operation here and fly it to the city, but how we go in is one of those three choices. We can go in hiding the mecha and the noticeably not-Homo Sapiens soldiers, and not let anyone know this is a force from outside this world until later. That's 'stealthy'. 'Aliens' is we go in publically, show off the mecha and the more exotic looking soldiers, and tell everyone up front this is an Imperial Army unit and what that means. 'Angels' is a bit of the same, but we lead with Lieutenant O'Brien, myself, and the rest of the Homo Avalonis soldiers who can show off their wings and convince the locals that we're 'agents of Heaven' or something. That way is likely easier for swaying people in the immediate term, but may have drawbacks later on when we have to explain we're not working for the Christian God or such. Although it still might be a good way to take down some of the more ugly warlords even if we don't go with it as a main strategy."

在比尔中士的点头示意下，青开口了：“我们将在这里接管整个行动，并将其飞往城市，但如何进入有三种选择。我们可以秘密携带机甲和明显非智人士兵进入，不让任何人知道这是一支来自外部世界的部队，直到后来。这称为‘隐秘’。‘外星人’则是公开进入，展示机甲和外观更为奇特的士兵，并直接告诉所有人这是一支帝国军队单位及其含义。‘天使’方式与此类似，但我们首先由奥布赖恩中尉、我以及其余能展示翅膀的阿瓦隆智人士兵领头，说服当地人我们是‘天堂的使者’之类。这种方式短期内可能更容易说服人们，但日后解释我们并非为基督教上帝服务时可能会有弊端。尽管如此，即使不作为主要策略，它仍可能是打击一些残暴军阀的有效手段。”

"Again, you people are strange, and now I'm having to turn into one of you. These are not the sorts of tactical decisions I was expecting to have to make," Asuka said dryly.

"再次，你们这些人真奇怪，现在我不得不变成你们中的一员。这些并不是我预期中需要做出的战术决策，"明日香干巴巴地说道。

Sergeant Bir smiled again. "Welcome to the Imperial Army, ma'am. And if you think this is weird, wait until we tell you about the rock concert."

比尔中士再次微笑道：“欢迎加入帝国军队，女士。如果您觉得这很奇怪，那等我们告诉您关于摇滚音乐会的事，您会更惊讶的。”

Shinji and Asuka shared a look, then returned to Sergeant Bir. "Rock concert?" they asked in confused unison. Misato started laughing again.

真嗣和明日香对视一眼，随后转向比尔中士。“摇滚音乐会？”他们困惑地异口同声问道。美里再次笑了起来。

Part 47 第 47 章

Bienvenido A La Reina Del Plata

欢迎来到银后之城

Eventually Misato managed to stop snickering, and a half-hour of briefing led Asuka to select stealth as the program for their immediate plan at least as far as their insertion to Buenos Aires went. Sergeant Bir snapped out some orders, and the company's soldiers fanned out to prepare the building for movement. They had only a few more hours of darkness to move into their target site before dawn would make stealth much more tricky. Shinji shook his head in amazement again. They were literally picking up stakes and moving on; using the gravity manipulation capabilities of their three mecha, they were going to simply pile everyone into their hangar building and lift it into the air for the flight to Buenos Aires.

最终，美里止住了窃笑，经过半小时的简报，明日香决定至少在潜入布宜诺斯艾利斯的过程中采用隐身方案。伯尔中士迅速下达命令，连队的士兵们四散开来，为建筑物的移动做准备。他们只剩下几个小时的黑暗时间来潜入目标地点，一旦黎明来临，隐秘行动将变得更加困难。真嗣再次惊讶地摇头。他们简直是拔寨而起，继续前行；利用三台机甲的重力操控能力，他们打算将所有人装进机库建筑，然后将其升空，飞往布宜诺斯艾利斯。

Shinji and Asuka's part was to pilot der Roter Wirbelsturm when they were ready to move, so he found himself standing with Asuka by the foot of the mecha with little to do until then. Not that this bothered the Third Child much; it gave him the chance to stand next to the immense red mecha holding Asuka's hand and standing close enough to feel her warmth in the pre-dawn chill. He glanced downward at their hands and gave a small smile. Unthinkable a week before, holding her hand now felt as good and as natural as breathing. And almost as painful and difficult to stop for very long. They both seemed to draw strength from the constant grip.

真嗣和明日香的任务是在准备行动时驾驶红色旋风，因此在那之前，他发现自己与明日香并肩站在机甲脚下，无事可做。这并未让第三适格者感到困扰；相反，这让他有机会紧握明日香的手，站在巨大的红色机甲旁，在黎明前的寒意中感受她的温暖。他低头看向他们的手，露出一丝微笑。一周前还难以想象的事，如今握着她的手，感觉就像呼吸一样自然和美好，却又同样痛苦和难以长时间放手。他们似乎都从这持续的紧握中汲取了力量。

"Guess I may have been overstating it a bit about 'personal issues' in that joke briefing, the way you two are looking. I don't think I've seen non-Imperials as close as you two in a long time."

看来我在那个笑话简报中提到的“个人问题”可能有点夸大其词了，看你们俩这表情。我很久没见过像你们俩这么亲密的非帝国人士了。

Shinji jumped slightly at Sergeant Bir's comment as he walked up behind them. Sergeant Bir's approach had been almost silent. He hadn't any hint of his presence until he'd spoken. He felt a little less embarrassed when he felt Asuka jump too. The tall NCO gave a half-nod of apology. "Sorry if I startled you. We're almost ready for you to start your StarStrider up."

听到比尔中士的话，真嗣微微一跳，这时比尔中士已经悄悄走到他们身后。他几乎没有察觉到比尔中士的到来，直到对方开口说话。感觉到明日香也吓了一跳，他稍微不那么尴尬了。高个子士官半点头表示歉意：“抱歉吓到你们了，我们马上就准备好让你启动星际飞行器了。”

It stuck Shinji that the three of them were alone for the first time since the portal had snapped shut. Time to ask a couple questions that had been nagging at his mind since the briefing of their rather ambitious new plan had been laid out. "Sergeant Bir, can we really do this? One hundred fifty seven of us against the world? And keeping up my request for no one getting killed, no less? Aren't we taking a pretty gigantic risk in all this?"

新吉意识到，自从传送门关闭后，他们三人还是第一次单独在一起。是时候问几个自简报会上提出那个颇为大胆的新计划以来一直困扰他的问题了。“比尔中士，我们真的能做到吗？我们这一百五十七人对付整个世界？而且还要坚持我的请求，确保无人丧生？我们在这件事上不是冒了相当大的风险吗？”

Bir shrugged. "The Emperor protects, sir. Imperial Rangers take on worse missions all the time and are expected to accomplish the impossible regularly. We're the Imperial Army. We don't believe in anything like an 'impossible mission'. A lot of Rangers get their start with us. We can take on almost any force this Earth can throw at us with high expectations of success. Keeping to a non-lethal protocol makes it tougher, but we're not exclusively about laying waste to the landscape. In a crisis, we can revert some of our systems to direct damage modes, and in true extremis we can pull some variation of the retreat-and-bunker program we outlined earlier. But from the briefing notes on the original plan, it looks like this world needs our help. Warlords, brutes, and madmen running things, public medieval torture for 'subversives' in the capital of the UN, and the new boss was ready to use N2 mines to blow up a city block by block rather than lose a coup? We can't sit back and passively wait for rescue with something like that in front of us, and not even try to help. Not us."

比尔耸了耸肩。“皇帝庇护着我们，长官。帝国游侠时常接手更为艰巨的任务，并被期望能常规性地完成看似不可能的使命。我们是帝国军队，从不相信有所谓的‘不可能任务’。许多游侠都是从我们这里起步的。我们能应对地球上几乎任何力量，并对其成功抱有高度期望。坚持非致命性协议虽然增加了难度，但我们并非只专注于摧毁一切。在危机时刻，我们可以将部分系统切换至直接破坏模式，而在极端情况下，我们还能采取之前概述的撤退与固守方案。但从最初的计划简报来看，这个世界需要我们的援助。军阀、暴徒和疯子掌权，联合国首都公开对‘异见者’实施中世纪式的酷刑，而新上任的领导人宁愿逐街区引爆 N2 地雷，也不愿在政变中失势？面对这样的局面，我们不能袖手旁观，坐等救援，而不去尝试施以援手。我们做不到。”

"I'd have thought you'd all be more cautious, given how long you seem to live," Shinji wondered at him. "The moral risk so far overshadows the physical that you have to act?"

"考虑到你们似乎寿命很长，我还以为你们会更加谨慎呢，" 真嗣对他感到疑惑。"道德风险远超身体风险，你们非得采取行动吗？"

Sergeant Bir gave him a level look. "You even need to ask, Lieutenant? 'Only the soul matters, in the end. All else is dross,' the Lord says, and I am a faithful TrueBorn of Avalon. The Emperor faces that fire every day. How can I, one of his children, do any less? And I thought you felt the same way, that the moral costs are at least as high as the physical? Why else would you have us aiming for a 'Nobody Dies' scenario?"

比尔中士平静地看了他一眼。“你还需要问吗，中尉？‘最终，唯有灵魂重要。其余皆为糟粕，’主如是说，而我作为阿瓦隆的忠实真生者，皇帝每日都面对那火焰。我身为他的子民，又岂能做得更少？我原以为你也有同感，认为道德代价至少与肉体代价相当。否则，你为何要我们追求‘无人伤亡’的局面？”

Shinji acknowledged the point with a nod. "I do feel that way. It's just kind of new to me to see a whole nation that feels the same way. We haven't seen anything like that on our world for a long time, even more so after the Third Impact. An entire country that devoted to helping the downtrodden rather than ruling them like barbarian chieftains is really strange for us. After the Second Impact, most countries were pretty ruthless in the name of maintaining stability."

真嗣点头表示认同。“我确实有这种感觉。只是对我来说，看到一个整个国家都有同样感受的情况很新鲜。在我们那个世界，已经很久没有见过这样的景象了，尤其是在第三次冲击之后。一个全心全意帮助弱势群体，而不是像野蛮酋长那样统治他们的国家，对我们来说真的很奇怪。第二次冲击之后，大多数国家为了维持稳定都相当无情。”

Sergeant Bir gave him a wry smile. "Well, one of the Founders, His Grace Grand Duke John Henry Drake, once said 'sometimes we're less a nation than a really big militant Holy Order', and he was only half-joking. The Lord founded us with a mission, and we have never lost sight of that. Do right. Uphold justice. Protect the good and punish the wicked. Bring the light and fight for the right until the day we all rise up. To turn away and hide when we can help isn't just a negative moral choice for us, it's practically apostasy. So we will hold on to our faith, and trust in the Lord and Lady, and do our damnedest to do what they have taught us is right."

比尔中士朝他苦笑了一下。“嗯，创始人之一，尊贵的约翰·亨利·德雷克大公爵曾说过，‘有时候我们与其说是一个国家，不如说是一个庞大的军事化神圣组织’，而他这话只说对了一半。主赋予我们使命而建立，我们从未忘记这一点。行正义之事，维护公正，保护善良，惩治邪恶。传播光明，为正义而战，直至我们共同崛起之日。在我们有能力帮助时转身逃避，对我们来说不仅是一种消极的道德选择，几乎等同于背弃信仰。因此，我们将坚守信念，信赖主与女神，竭尽全力去做他们教导我们的正确之事。”

"And you just wake up on Second Chance or one of those other moons if you die here, right?" Asuka asked. "Your gods restore you and you can go right back at it. That's how Ching… I mean, Lieutenant Leibshott made it sound when she explained it to me."

"如果你在这里死了，就会在第二次机会或其他那些月亮上醒来，对吧？" 明日香问道。"你的神会复活你，然后你就可以立刻重新开始。这就是青……我是说，莱布肖特中尉向我解释时的说法。"

"Ehh… usually, yes, ma'am. Not now, though. 'Dragonfly' means we're cut-off, totally. Even spiritual avenues are blocked. Our souls can't reach home right now. There's some chance if we are killed on this world we'll end up in whatever the local afterlife is, but it's not a good one. We're too different. We die here, we probably die in truth."

呃……通常来说，是的，女士。但现在不行。“蜻蜓”意味着我们完全被切断了，彻底的。甚至连精神通道都被阻塞了。我们的灵魂此刻无法回归家园。如果我们在这个世界死去，或许会进入当地的来世，但那并不是个好去处。我们太与众不同了。在这里死去，可能就真的死了。

Shinji took a deeper breath and heard Asuka's matching gasp. "But you're not going to change anything about what we're about to start here, are you?" he asked. "That's what you meant by all that. Even true death of your souls won't sway you from doing what your faith demands."

真嗣深吸一口气，听到了明日香同步的喘息。“但你不会改变我们即将开始的事情，对吧？”他问道，“这就是你所说的意思。即使灵魂真正的死亡，也无法动摇你们按照信仰所要求的去做。”

Sergeant Bir just solemnly nodded. "When we win the glory will be all the greater for the odds we overcame. And whether we win or we fall, we will never be forgotten by the Empire. If we are to be the only light in a world of darkness, then it's time to shine." He raised his left wrist to his mouth and keyed the unit broadcast. "Saddle up, Avaloni! We've got a world to save! Lord and Lady with us! Numquam Soli!"

比尔中士只是庄重地点了点头。“当我们赢得胜利时，因为我们所克服的困难，荣耀将更加辉煌。无论我们胜利还是倒下，帝国永远不会忘记我们。如果我们注定要成为黑暗世界中的唯一光明，那么现在就是闪耀的时刻。”他抬起左手腕，对着嘴边的单位广播键说道：“上马，阿瓦隆人！我们要拯救一个世界！愿主与女士与我们同在！永不孤单！”

From around them Shinji could hear various soldiers' responses, led by a shouted unit response; "Never Alone!" "I'll quit when the Emperor does." "...though I be the lone survivor." "Anybody got a copy of the Anabasis?" "As long as I can see the light..."

四周传来士兵们各式各样的回应，领头的是一声高喊的部队口号：“永不孤单！”“皇帝不退，我亦不退。”“即便我成为唯一的幸存者。”“有人带了《远征记》吗？”“只要我还能看见光明……”

Sergeant Bir nodded at them again. "Start her up, ma'am. Time to ride out and chastise the evildoer. And in honor of our mission, I've found a nice classical piece to play over the unit push as we start off…"

比尔中士再次向他们点头。“女士，启动吧。是时候出发去惩戒恶人了。为了纪念我们的使命，我找到了一首优美的古典乐曲，在我们出发时播放给全队听……”

"Don Barceló! Don Barceló! There's something you… oh! I'm sorry if I interrupted, sir."

堂巴塞洛！堂巴塞洛！有件事您……哦！抱歉，先生，如果我打扰了。

The current ruler of what remained of Argentina's capital city turned away from the weeping wreck of a human being still chained to the rack against the wall of his office. The man known to the people of the people of Argentina as Don Barceló, once of the Dominican Replublic's nastier prisons, and after the chaos following the Third Impact lord of Buenos Aires, waved a dismissive hand at his aide's apology. "It is nothing, Juan, I was done with this one. Now she knows better than to be insolent or slow when I give her an order. Get one of the nurses in here to patch her up and then throw her in the harem so that she might provide an educational example to the others. We'll throw her out later if she expires. Now, what was so important you came running in here?" He carefully placed the bloodied knife back in its rack with its mates and wiped his hands on a towel.

阿根廷首都残存之地的现任统治者，转身离开那仍被锁链束缚在办公室墙壁刑架上、哭泣不止的人类残骸。这位被阿根廷人民称为唐·巴塞洛的人物，曾隶属于多米尼加共和国最阴暗的监狱，在第三次冲击后的混乱中成为布宜诺斯艾利斯的领主，他挥手打发了助手的道歉。“无妨，胡安，我对这个人已经处理完了。现在她明白，在我下达命令时，绝不敢再有傲慢或迟缓。叫个护士进来给她包扎一下，然后扔进后宫，让她给其他人做个教训。如果她死了，我们再把她扔出去。说吧，什么事这么急，让你跑进来？”他小心翼翼地将沾血的刀放回刀架，与其他刀具并列，随后用毛巾擦了擦手。

The aide tore his eyes away from the bleeding woman and blinked, trying to regain his train of thought. Even years of service as Don Barceló's assistant proved unable to fully desensitize him to what he'd just seen his boss doing. The woman had had a nose and both breasts intact when she'd arrived at the Casa Rosada, the former Presidential Palace last week as part of the latest 'tribute' from the countryside, for one.

助手将目光从流血的女子身上移开，眨了眨眼，试图恢复思绪。即便多年来作为唐·巴塞洛的助理，也未能让他完全对刚才目睹老板所为无动于衷。那女子上周作为乡村最新“贡品”抵达玫瑰宫——前总统府时，还拥有完整的鼻子和双乳。

"Ah, there's something strange going on in the city around the Monumental Stadium, Don Barceló. And none of the patrols we've sent to investigate are answering their phones or radios."

啊，纪念碑体育场周围的城市里似乎发生了些奇怪的事，堂巴塞洛。我们派去调查的巡逻队没有一个接电话或对讲机的。

The Don's eyebrows rose. "Really? It has been a while since anyone has tried anything so foolish as attacking my men. Perhaps we've got some new friends out from the sea looking to make trouble, no?"

教父的眉毛挑了起来。“真的吗？已经很久没有人敢这么愚蠢地攻击我的人了。或许是从海上来了些新朋友，想找麻烦，不是吗？”

Juan Garcia fidgeted nervously. "This… we don't know why the patrols have not been coming back, sir. But this is something more than just someone ambushing them. This is something… I don't even know what to tell you. Look out the window towards the Belgrano district. You should be able to see it from here." He walked over to the north-facing window and pulled aside the thick drapery.

胡安·加西亚紧张地扭动着身体。“这……我们不知道为什么巡逻队没有回来，先生。但这不仅仅是有人伏击他们那么简单。这是……我甚至不知道该怎么跟您说。朝贝尔格拉诺区窗外看去，您应该能从这里看到。”他走向朝北的窗户，拉开了厚重的窗帘。

"Eh, what are you babbling about?" the Don rumbled, trailing after him to peer out the window. He followed his aide's pointing finger towards the huge football stadium up the coast from the Casa Rosada. The stadium itself was obscured by tall buildings in the way, but he could see something in the air over where it must be to the northwest. "They have something ne- ...Name of God, what is that?"

"哎，你在嘀咕什么呢？"唐低沉地问道，跟在他后面向窗外望去。他顺着助手指向的方向，望向海岸边从玫瑰宫往上的巨大足球场。球场本身被沿途的高楼遮挡，但他能看到西北方向上空有什么东西。"他们有什么新...天啊，那是什么？"

Over the distant mass of the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti, suspended somehow in the air, hung a huge red billboard, facing them flat-on. No, wait, it was rotating… the next side slowly came into view. Four sides spun slowly in the air over the stadium, each at least one hundred meters on a side. 'Coming Friday! Open Rock Concert! Free Food & Drink For All! Free Medical Clinic On Site! Bring Everyone!' it proclaimed in letters that had to be tens of meters high, with a running countdown timer at the bottom.

在遥远的安东尼奥·韦斯普奇·利贝尔蒂纪念体育场上空，悬浮着一块巨大的红色广告牌，正面朝向他们。不，等等，它在旋转……下一面缓缓进入视野。四面缓缓在体育场上空旋转，每面至少有一百米见方。“本周五开幕！露天摇滚音乐会！免费食物与饮料供应！现场免费医疗诊所！带上所有人！”广告上的文字高达数十米，底部还有一个倒计时器在不断跳动。

"How long has that been there? How the Hell is it floating like that? What is going on in my city?!" the Don quickly raised his voice to a shout. "Get my personal guards ready! And the ready company of the Militia! I'm going down there to settle this myself!"

"那东西在那儿多久了？它到底是怎么飘起来的？我的城市里到底发生了什么？！" 唐迅速提高嗓门喊道。"给我召集私人卫队！还有民兵预备队！我要亲自下去解决这件事！"

"Yes, Don," Juan bobbled nervously, and scooted out of the office. Don Barceló hated things that disrupted his little kingdom. When it was one of the infrequent uprisings by the peasantry or attacks by rival gangs, the Don took out his frustrations on their enemies and prisoners afterward. When there was no such targets to be had, or he was just bored, he relieved his tensions on people closer to hand. Juan Garcia had survived three years as Don Barceló's aide by making sure he was never the closest candidate for such when the mood took the Don. Being efficient at his job was another good survival method. He had the Don's personal troops ready to move in less than ten minutes.

“是的，唐，”胡安紧张地结巴着，迅速离开了办公室。唐·巴塞洛讨厌任何扰乱他小王国的事物。当遇到农民的零星起义或敌对帮派的袭击时，唐会将怒火发泄在敌人和俘虏身上。若无此类目标，或仅仅是无聊时，他便将压力释放在身边人身上。胡安·加西亚作为唐·巴塞洛的助手，已幸存三年，全靠确保自己绝非唐情绪来袭时的首选目标。高效完成工作是另一生存良策。他能在十分钟内让唐的私人军队整装待发。

The Don spared him the merest flicker of a glance as he swept past still strapping on his favorite machine pistols and vaulted onto the hood of his armored HMMWV and up into the .50 cal gunner's spot. "Let's go!" he yelled at the driver, and the ten other armored cars of his guards began to roll.

教父只是在他身边匆匆一瞥，便继续扣上他钟爱的机关手枪，一跃而上装甲悍马的车头，再顺势攀入.50 口径机枪手的位置。“出发！”他对着司机大喊，随即他那十辆护卫装甲车也纷纷启动。

Garcia took a breath in relief as the last truck left the plaza and headed north. He'd been slightly worried the Don would shoot the messenger of this strange news. He'd done it before. Wiping the nervous sweat off his brow, Garcia turned to head back upstairs and clean up the Don's leavings before he returned. The woman might even still be alive. What had been her name again?

加西亚松了一口气，当最后一辆卡车离开广场向北驶去时。他稍有担心，唐会因为这奇怪的消息而射杀信使。他以前就这么做过。擦去额头上的紧张汗水，加西亚转身回到楼上，在唐回来之前清理他的遗留物。那个女人可能还活着。她叫什么名字来着？

Sergei Andropov wiped his sweating brow again and muttered a few more curses in Russian. He hated the heat in this fucking city. He hated this city, the madman's polyglot buffet of languages the rag-wrapped mass of people that filled it spoke, and the wretches that spoke it. He missed Russia. He missed winter, God damn it. Cool, snowy winter, not this constant sodden tropical heat this damned city was always awash in. He missed speaking proper Russian, and speaking it to a properly beautiful Russian girl. He hadn't found more than a handful of former Russian Army men in his entire four years in Buenos Aires, but even their few faces were a welcome addition to his group of Don Barceló's Militia. Being able to talk to them reminded him at least a little of home. It kept the homesickness at bay a bit, and was one of the nice parts of being a platoon leader in the Militia.

谢尔盖·安德罗波夫再次擦去额头上的汗水，用俄语低声咒骂了几句。他讨厌这座城市的热浪。他讨厌这座城市，讨厌那些裹着破布的人群所使用的疯狂多语种大杂烩，以及那些使用这些语言的可怜虫。他怀念俄罗斯，怀念冬天，该死的。他想念凉爽的雪季，而不是这座城市永远浸泡在其中的潮湿热带高温。他怀念说一口纯正的俄语，以及与一位真正美丽的俄罗斯女孩交谈。在布宜诺斯艾利斯的整整四年里，他没遇到过几个前俄罗斯军队的士兵，但即使是这些寥寥几张面孔，也为他的唐·巴塞洛民兵组织增添了温暖。能与他们交谈，至少让他略微想起了家乡。这让他对家乡的思念稍有缓解，也是作为民兵排长为数不多的美好之处。

His ears perked up as he heard the steady growl of a car's engine approaching the checkpoint his platoon was manning this morning. His eyes widened a bit as the amazingly clean and shiny Cadillac convertible purred towards the checkpoint with a complement of pretty women inside, not a man or a gun in sight. A nasty smile spread across his face. There were some other nice parts to being a Militia leader, too. He waved at the car to halt at the checkpoint and brought his AK-47 around to easy reach on his chest as he got ready to exercise one of those privileges right now.

当他听到一辆汽车引擎平稳的轰鸣声逐渐接近他所在排今早守卫的检查站时，他的耳朵立刻竖了起来。随着一辆异常干净闪亮的凯迪拉克敞篷车缓缓驶向检查站，车内坐着几位漂亮女士，不见任何男子或武器的踪影，他的眼睛不禁睁大了几分。一丝狡黠的笑容在他脸上蔓延开来。作为民兵领袖，还有些其他美妙之处。他挥手示意车辆停在检查站前，同时将 AK-47 调整至胸前便于取用，准备立即行使其中一项特权。

His eyes narrowed a bit as the car came closer. There was a large sign fixed to the trunk of the car, advertising a 'FREE CONCERT'. The sign was, amazingly, in Russian. Did one of these women speak Russian? Was one of them from the Motherland? That would be a rare treat. He hadn't seen a true Russian beauty in years. The driver had such wonderful blonde hair… she looked like a girl he'd known back in Chelyabinsk!

当汽车逐渐靠近时，他的眼睛微微眯起。车后座固定着一个巨大的广告牌，上面写着“免费音乐会”。令人惊讶的是，这广告牌竟是用俄语写的。难道这些女士中有人会说俄语？其中一位来自祖国吗？那可真是难得的惊喜。他已经多年未曾见过真正的俄罗斯美人了。那位司机拥有如此迷人的金发……她看起来就像他在车里雅宾斯克认识的那个女孩！

The car slowed to a halt right beside him. The stunning blonde in the driver's seat blinked impossible blue eyes right at him. "Good morning, officer. How can we help you fine men this lovely day?" She did speak Russian! Perfectly! And her voice was like music.

汽车缓缓停在他身旁，驾驶座上那位惊艳的金发女郎眨着不可思议的蓝眼睛直视着他。“早上好，警官。在这美好的一天，我们能帮您什么忙吗？”她确实会说俄语！说得完美无瑕！而且她的声音宛如天籁。

His intent rapidly shifted from 'inviting' her into the checkpoint shack with a half raised rifle to hesitantly asking, "H-hello, miss. I'm Sergei. What is your name?"

他的意图迅速从用半举的步枪“邀请”她进入检查站小屋转变为迟疑地询问：“你、你好，小姐。我叫谢尔盖。请问您贵姓？”

"Hello, Sergei," the woman said in perfect Russian. "I'm Ekaterina. We're going around the city telling everyone about the free concert we're putting on this Friday. We've got a sneak preview for all Militia members going on right now if you'd like to see what we're all about. Would you like to follow us back?"

"你好，谢尔盖，"女子用流利的俄语说道，"我是叶卡捷琳娜。我们正在城里四处宣传，告诉大家我们这周五将举办一场免费音乐会。如果你愿意，我们现在为所有民兵成员提供了一个抢先预览的机会，让你了解我们的活动。你想跟我们回去看看吗？"

Sergei could feel another prickle of sweat forming on his brow, but didn't want to even blink long enough to wipe it away. That would take away precious seconds from looking at Ekaterina and drowning in her eyes. Her Russian was even accented just like his, a faint rural tinge far from Moscow's standard. Wait, follow her back? Back where? "Follow you?" he mumbled.

谢尔盖能感觉到额头上又冒出了一层细汗，但他甚至不愿眨眼去擦掉。那会从凝视叶卡捷琳娜、沉醉于她眼眸中的宝贵时间里夺走几秒。她的俄语口音和他一样，带着淡淡的乡村气息，远离莫斯科的标准。等等，跟她回去？回哪里？“跟你走？”他喃喃道。

"Yes, back to the Monumental Stadium. We've got all the free drinks and entertainments you could want, and if you boys come with us now, you get a sneak preview of what we have to offer; we've got a fleet coming in from Europe in two months, and there will be lots of room for anyone who wants a ride back when they go. Would you like to see the Motherland again, Sergei, to go home?" Her question was almost softly pleading.

是的，回到纪念碑体育场。我们提供您想要的所有免费饮料和娱乐活动，如果你们现在跟我们来，还能提前一睹我们的风采；两个月后，我们将有一支船队从欧洲抵达，届时会有足够的空间供任何想要搭乘返回的人。你想再次见到祖国吗，谢尔盖，想回家吗？”她的提问几乎带着温柔的恳求。

Homesickness flared like a blast of heat in him. He swallowed. Go with her… er, them? Home? Yes, home sounded good. "Yes, let's go with you," his mouth numbly echoed. His head was buzzing. He looked around at his men. Several of them were likewise crowded around the car, talking to the other occupants. Most had a similarly unfocused look on their faces, matching his own. For some reason this failed to bother him. "Everybody mount up! We're following them to the Stadium." His men vaguely nodded, and they all began clambering into the checkpoint's motley collection of jeeps, pickup trucks, and his own HMMWV.

思乡之情在他心中如烈焰般燃烧。他咽了口唾沫，跟她……不，跟他们走？回家？对，回家听起来不错。“好，我们跟你们走。”他木然地重复着。脑海中嗡嗡作响，他环顾四周的同伴。好几个人也围在车旁，与其他乘客交谈。大多数人脸上都带着与他相似的茫然表情，不知为何，这并未让他感到困扰。“大家上车！我们跟着他们去体育场。”他的同伴们含糊地点头，随即纷纷爬上检查站那各式各样的吉普车、皮卡和自己的悍马车。

As his own vehicle rumbled to life and began to move out, Sergei briefly cast an eye at the radio mounted between the front seats. Should he report this in to his commanders? He dismissed it from his thoughts after only a moment. No, they didn't need to be disturbed by this. If it turned out to be nothing, they'd be upset at even mentioning it. Yes, he'd just see what it was first. And if there truly was a boat home to the Motherland in this somewhere, maybe he'd never have to report in at all. Home… so far away, he'd never thought he'd ever see it again… yes, home sounded good. Follow the pretty girl, Sergei… yes.

当自己的车辆轰鸣启动，开始驶出时，谢尔盖短暂地瞥了一眼安装在前排座椅间的无线电。他应该向指挥官报告这件事吗？仅一瞬间，他便打消了这个念头。不，他们无需为此被打扰。如果最终证明这只是虚惊一场，他们甚至会因为提及此事而感到不悦。是的，他先去探个究竟再说。如果这里真的有通往祖国的归途，或许他根本就不必汇报。家……如此遥远，他从未想过还能再次见到……是的，回家听起来真好。跟着那位美丽的女孩，谢尔盖……没错。

Senior Lance Corporal Wong looked back over the trunk of the Cadillac and nodded with approval. All four vehicles at the checkpoint were falling into line behind them, heading for the stadium. He turned back to the driver. "Good job, Ektheria. Looks like they all took the bait."

高级下士王回头望了望凯迪拉克的车尾，满意地点了点头。检查站的四辆车都跟在他们后面，正朝着体育场驶去。他转头对司机说：“干得好，埃克塞里亚。看来他们都上钩了。”

The Psi platoon Junior Private First Class at the wheel shrugged her shoulders and brushed one hand back through her long silver-white hair. "Between the pheromone cloud and the combined psi field we're putting out, I think I could have said I was Gorgoth the Devourer here to eat his soul, and he'd still have happily followed us back. Hitting him with the subsonics and pushing his homesickness and horny-lizard-brain buttons just made it simple. They were so bowled over, they didn't even notice most of us weren't Homo Sapiens or female." She shook herself. "How many more of these patrols do we have to sweep up? The inside of that guy's head was disgusting."

驾驶座上的超能小队初级一等兵耸了耸肩，一手捋过她那银白色的长发。“在费洛蒙云和我们共同释放的意念场之间，我觉得就算我说我是吞噬者戈格斯来吃他的灵魂，他也会乐意跟我们回来的。用次声波刺激他，再加上触动他的思乡之情和本能欲望，事情就简单多了。他们完全被迷住了，甚至没注意到我们大多数人既非智人也不是女性。”她抖了抖身子，“我们还得收拾多少这样的巡逻队？那家伙的内心世界真是令人作呕。”

Wong flicked his eyes over the map his interface band was projecting on the back of the seat in front of him. "Looks like this is the last one for our sector. Scout platoon has picked out a few more in other parts of the city, but they're not our problem. We get this band of thugs back to the stadium and let the rest of the company neuter them, and we've taken care of most of the local warlord's mobile forces in the city."

黄瞥了一眼他的接口带在前方座椅背上投射出的地图。“看来这是我们区域最后一个了。侦察排还在城市的其他部分找到了几个，但那不是我们的问题。我们把这帮恶棍押回体育场，让连队其他人处理他们，这样我们就解决了本地军阀在城中的大部分机动部队。”

"Good. You don't want to know what that guy was thinking when he thought he saw just a carload of 'cute, defenseless girls' pulling up. Ick. I'll be glad when they're not in any shape to cause trouble anymore."

好。你不会想知道那家伙以为自己看到一车“可爱无害的女孩”时在想什么。真恶心。等他们再也无法惹麻烦时，我会很高兴的。

Sergeant Qwi!Tanak clacked her beak and ruffed out her crest in agreement. "We can probably guess, Private. Good job concealing us anyhow. The idea of some of them perving on me is halfway between funny and disgusting on its own. I lay eggs, for Lady's sake! Now floor it. The sooner we get these guys back to base, the sooner we can have lunch, and I'm starving."

中士 Qwi!Tanak 咔哒一声合上喙，竖起羽冠表示赞同。“我们大概能猜到，列兵。不管怎样，隐蔽工作做得不错。他们中有些人对我垂涎三尺，这事儿本身就介于好笑和恶心之间。我可是会下蛋的，看在女神的份上！现在加速吧。我们越早把这些家伙送回基地，就能越早吃上午饭，我都快饿死了。”

"Roger, sarge." The Cadillac's V8 roared as she stomped on the gas. The militia trucks obligingly sped up to follow.

"收到，中士。"随着她猛踩油门，凯迪拉克的 V8 引擎轰鸣起来。民兵的卡车也顺从地加速跟上。

### Chapter 26 Party At The Stadium

hinji wiped away the sweat the morning sun was already spawning on his forehead and shook his head. He didn't know why Sergeant Bir had called the first song they'd taken off to 'classical'. German heavy metal hardly fit his definition of 'classical', especially a song called 'Engel'. Asuka had certainly gotten into it, though, headbanging along to the pounding beat. When he'd commented on the choice of music and requested real classical, they'd put on Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' for their final approach to the battered cityscape of Buenos Aires.

真嗣擦去额头上的汗水，清晨的阳光已经开始在那里滋生。他摇了摇头，不明白为什么比尔中士会将他们起飞时听的第一首歌称为“古典”。德国重金属音乐几乎不符合他对“古典”的定义，尤其是那首名为《天使》的歌曲。不过，明日香显然很喜欢，随着那震撼的节奏摇头晃脑。当他评论音乐选择并要求真正的古典音乐时，他们为接近布宜诺斯艾利斯那破败的城市景观的最后阶段播放了瓦格纳的《女武神的骑行》。

"Gott knows I don't want to be an angel…" Asuka sang quietly next to him, still carrying the tune. "Heh. I like Sergeant Bir's choice of music. And properly German, too. Pity the band didn't survive the Second Impact on our world. I'd never heard of them before." She looked up at the enormous, slowly rotating holographic billboard hanging over the bulk of the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. "And it's pretty nice the way that holographic sign hides the mecha inside the stadium. I can't wait to properly impress the locals with Red Whirlwind's public debut flight."

"上帝知道我不想成为天使……"明日香在他身旁轻声唱着，旋律依旧。"嘿，我喜欢比尔中士选的音乐，而且很德国。可惜乐队没能在第二次冲击中幸存下来。我以前从未听说过他们。"她抬头望向那座巨大的、缓缓旋转的立体全息广告牌，它悬挂在纪念碑球场的大部分上方。"而且，那全息标志巧妙地隐藏了体育场内的机甲，真是不错。我迫不及待想用红色旋风的首次公开飞行给当地人留下深刻印象。"

The Imperial force had made the athletic fields and sports complex around the slightly dilapidated Argentine national stadium their new base. The lack of power, scattered garbage, and general air of abandonment made it clear that there hadn't been any other residents or sporting events at the costal complex since the Third Impact. No one had objected to or even seemingly noticed their midday arrival, thanks to the mecha's combined active holo-camouflage making them appear as nothing more than a shimmer in the air. One of the open fields near the stadium easily served as a new plot for their hangar, and they parked the mecha inside the walls of the stadium.

帝国军队已将略显破败的阿根廷国家体育场周边的运动场和体育综合体作为新基地。自第三次冲击以来，这里因电力缺失、垃圾散落和一片荒废的氛围，显然未曾有其他居民或体育赛事在此沿海综合体举行。得益于机甲联合启动的全息伪装，使其在空中仅呈现为微弱闪烁，他们的正午抵达既未遭到反对，也似乎未被察觉。体育场附近的一片开阔地便成了他们机库的新址，机甲被停放在体育场的围墙内。

Now, after a few hours work had rendered at least a few of the buildings habitable again, they'd dispatched teams of soldiers out into the city designed to lure the local warlord's militia into their reach. Like flies to flypaper, it hadn't taken long before there was a growing motley collection of trucks, jeeps, and former military vehicles clustered around the stadium complex, and a likewise growing crowd of glassy-eyed militiamen being carefully relieved of their weapons and guided into a cordoned off section of the stands inside the stadium. Plentiful drugged food and drink kept them passive and easily suggestible. All Shinji and Asuka had had to do for the last couple of hours was stand by and watch their 'pit crew' conceal their mecha inside the stadium and listen to occasional status reports relayed through Ching.

如今，经过数小时的努力，至少部分建筑得以重新入住。他们派遣了多支士兵小队深入城市，旨在引诱当地军阀的民兵进入他们的掌控范围。如同苍蝇被粘蝇纸吸引，不久便有一群五花八门的卡车、吉普车和前军用车辆聚集在体育场周围，同样数量渐增的目光呆滞的民兵被小心翼翼地解除武装，引导至体育场内被隔离的看台区域。充足的下药食物和饮料使他们保持温顺且易受操控。过去几个小时里，真嗣和明日香只需站在一旁，观看他们的“维修团队”将机甲隐藏在体育场内，并偶尔通过 Ching 接收状态报告。

Said Imperial Lieutenant walked over to them once more with another report. "Heads up, sir and ma'am. The king rat seems to have finally noticed all his men have suddenly become ardent football fans who don't answer their radios. Or maybe they finally noticed our subtle little ad campaign here. A convoy of military vehicles just left the Casa Rosada and are headed this way. ETA is fifteen minutes. Time for you two to get out of sight. Your Pilot suits stand out a bit, and we don't want anything too odd to distract him from Lieutenant Katsuragi's little routine."

帝国中尉再次走过来，手里拿着另一份报告。“长官，女士，注意了。那只大老鼠似乎终于发现他的手下突然都成了狂热的足球迷，不再接听无线电。或者他们终于注意到了我们这里的小小广告攻势。一队军车刚从玫瑰宫出发，正朝这边来。预计十五分钟后到达。你们俩该躲起来了。你们的飞行员制服太显眼，我们可不想有什么太奇怪的东西分散他对葛城中尉表演的注意力。”

"What about you, Ching? You're still in uniform. Isn't that going to look a little odd to him?" Asuka replied.

"你呢，青？你还穿着制服。这在他看来不会显得有点奇怪吗？" 明日香回答道。

Ching smiled. She'd shown them another tiny stud on the underside of their uniform's collar that shifted it from 'low-grade dress uniform' to 'field' setting. The ribbons vanished, the rank insignia became smaller and subdued, and a lot more pockets appeared on now smeary camouflage fabric. Ching's Navy uniform wasn't quite the same as the rest of the Army ones, but it was still very noticeably a uniform in a place where it would surely stand out from the urban ruins and grubbily dressed people around them. "No worries, ma'am. I found some native disguise for my too lovely self to hide in. Check it out."

青微笑着，她向他们展示了制服领子下方的一枚小巧别针，轻轻一拨，便将“低级礼服”模式切换成了“野战”模式。顿时，勋带消失，军衔标志缩小并变得低调，而原本平整的迷彩布料上则多出了许多口袋。青的海军制服虽与陆军同袍们的有所不同，但在这片城市废墟和衣衫褴褛的人群中，依然醒目异常。“别担心，女士。我为自己找到了一套本地伪装，足以掩盖我这过于出众的外表。瞧瞧吧。”

She unfurled a dingy bundle that she'd had under her arm, revealing a dirty, striped poncho and mashed up broadbrimmed hat. She pulled the poncho on over her head and added the hat. "Ta da! Thus I will just blend into the background, catching any of this lot who still have their wits about them. How do I look?"

她展开了夹在腋下的一个脏兮兮的包裹，露出了一件脏兮兮的条纹披风和一顶压扁的宽边帽。她将披风套在头上，又戴上了帽子。“看好了！这样我就能完美融入背景，捕捉那些还保持清醒的家伙。我看起来怎么样？”

"Like an extra from a bad Western," Asuka drawled. She shook her head. "Come on, Third. Let's find a spot we can watch from out of sight." She grabbed his hand and started to lead him up the ramp of the car park behind them. "The second floor of this thing ought to do it."

"就像西部烂片里的龙套一样。"明日香拖着长音说道。她摇了摇头，"走吧，三号。我们找个能隐蔽观察的地方。"她抓住他的手，开始领着他沿着身后的停车场坡道向上走。"这地方的二楼应该合适。"

'Four years after the end of the world, and somehow I'm still getting pulled along by Asuka while we're both wearing what are pretty much plugsuits,' Shinji mused. 'Of course, there are some nice differences.' His eyes drifted downward. He'd always quietly enjoyed how Asuka looked in a plugsuit. Four more years of growing up had only made the view even nicer. A view that now sparked memories of last night and oh gods tonight they'd-

世界终结四年后，不知怎的，我仍被明日香拉着前行，两人都穿着几乎等同于插入栓服的装束，' 真嗣暗自思忖。当然，也有一些美妙的差异。' 他的目光不由自主地向下游移。他一直默默欣赏着明日香身着插入栓服的模样。又四年的成长，让这景象愈发赏心悦目。此刻的景象勾起了昨晚的回忆，哦，天哪，今晚他们将——

A view that suddenly got much closer as he walked right into the back of her when she stopped.

他走着走着，突然间那景象变得近了许多，因为她停下脚步，他径直撞到了她身后。

"Ow! Watch it, Third!" "哎哟！小心点，老三！"

"I'm sorr-" "我很抱歉-"

"I bet I could fling you off this spot hard enough to hit the roof of that truck, Third Child. What gives?"

我敢打赌，我能把你从这个地方狠狠地甩出去，让你直接撞上那辆卡车的车顶，第三子。怎么了？

"Um… I wasn't watching where I was going?"

"呃……我没注意自己往哪儿走？"

"….you were staring at my ass again, weren't you?"

"……你又在盯着我的屁股看了，对吧？"

"…yes?" "……是的？"

She smirked wickedly at him. "Good. But eyes up, we're on a mission. Playtime later." Asuka looked at her interface band. "Or… what the Hell, we've got at least five minutes before anything happens. C'mere." She grabbed his shoulders and yanked him into another intense kiss.

她邪魅地朝他一笑：“很好。但注意了，我们还有任务在身。玩乐的事稍后再说。”明日香瞥了一眼她的界面带，“或者……管他呢，至少还有五分钟才有什么动静。过来。”她一把抓住他的肩膀，猛地将他拉入一个热烈的吻中。

Shinji was all too happy to fall into the embrace, snaking his arms around her almost as fast as she did around him. They stumbled back a couple of steps before fetching up against one of the concrete roof pillars next to the low barrier overlooking the space between the car park and the stadium. Asuka's body felt warm and solid against him, pressed up against the pillar. He felt her right leg come up to wrap around his hip and pull him against her tighter.

真嗣几乎是迫不及待地投入了拥抱，他的双臂迅速环绕着她，几乎与她环绕他的速度一样快。他们踉跄后退几步，最终背靠在屋顶混凝土柱子上，旁边是俯瞰停车场与体育场间空地的低矮护栏。明日香的身躯紧贴着他，温暖而坚实。他感觉到她的右腿抬起，缠绕在他的腰际，将他更紧密地拉向自己。

It felt to him like only moments, but it had to have been a good bit more before a slightly awkward cough snapped the two of them out of their trance and got them to look around. Sergeant Bir stood a short distance away regarding them with some amusement. "We have got to stop meeting like this, Lieutenants. You two may start thinking of me as some terrible crimp on your relationship, or worse, a buzzkill. I really am sorry to interrupt."

对他来说仿佛只是片刻，但实际上肯定过了好一会儿，直到一声略显尴尬的咳嗽才将两人从恍惚中惊醒，让他们环顾四周。不远处，比尔中士正带着几分戏谑地看着他们。“我们得停止这样见面了，中尉们。你们俩可能会开始觉得我是个破坏你们关系的人，甚至更糟，是个扫兴的家伙。真的很抱歉打扰到你们。”

Asuka sighed in annoyance. "Sergeant Bir, if I'm in command of this unit now, can I order you to go the Hell away and come back later?"

明日香不耐烦地叹了口气。“比尔中士，既然我现在指挥这个单位，我能命令你滚开，晚点再回来吗？”

"Technically, yes, ma'am, but right now I think I should warn you that the local jefe's convoy is about to pull into our front yard, and you should probably put your game face on. Lieutenant Katsuragi is the one who's supposed to be distracting them, not you."

从技术上讲，是的，女士，但现在我想提醒您，当地首领的车队即将驶入我们的前院，您可能需要摆出应对的表情。应该是葛城中尉负责分散他们的注意力，而不是您。

Asuka just had time to nod before the deep rumble of multiple military-grade diesel engines could be heard approaching around the bend of the stadium. Asuka took a half-step back further into shadow and pulled Shinji by his arm with her. The column of heavily armed HMMWVs, guns pointing in all directions, screeched to a halt just below their position. A large, shaved-bald man with an extensive array of scars and tattoos quickly jumped out of the turret of the lead vehicle. He stood on the hood of the HMMWV and fired a burst from his sub-machine gun into the air as two-dozen equally heavily armed men piled out of the vehicles and took up a perimeter around him, glaring at everyone nearby, weapons raised and ready.

就在明日香来得及点头之际，一阵低沉的轰鸣声从体育场拐角处传来，那是多台军用级柴油发动机的声音。明日香半步退入阴影，同时拉住真嗣的手臂。一列武装到牙齿的悍马车，枪口指向四面八方，在他们下方戛然而止。一个光头大汉，身上布满疤痕与纹身，迅速从领头车辆的炮塔跳下，站在悍马车的引擎盖上，向空中连射一梭子冲锋枪。紧接着，二十多名同样全副武装的男子从车中涌出，围绕着他形成警戒圈，目光凶狠地扫视四周，武器高举，蓄势待发。

"I am Don Juan Ruiz de la Cruz Barceló, and this is my city!" he shouted. "Who the fuck are you people, and what the fuck is that thing?!" he added, pointing to the holographic billboard silently rotating over the stadium. Shinji spared a moment's thought to be glad their interface bands could do on-the-fly translation of his Spanish and pipe the understanding of what was being said into their ears. The effect was a bit like hearing a running UN-style second voice translating everything for him. He still didn't know how he was supposed to speak Spanish, but he could hear just fine.

我是唐璜·鲁伊斯·德拉·克鲁兹·巴塞洛，这座城市属于我！"他高声宣布。"你们他妈的是谁，那玩意儿又是什么鬼东西？！"他补充道，手指向体育场上方无声旋转的全息广告牌。真嗣分神片刻，庆幸他们的接口带能实时翻译他的西班牙语，并将理解的内容直接传入他们耳中。效果有点像听到联合国风格的同步口译，为他解说一切。他仍不清楚自己该如何说西班牙语，但听懂倒是不成问题。

The barrel of Don Barceló's gun sweeping back and forth in front of him stopped suddenly as he spotted a familiar face slouched in the shade of the stadium entryway. "Andropov, you fucking idiot! What the hell are you doing here?! Where are your men?!"

唐·巴塞洛的枪管在他面前来回扫动，突然停了下来，因为他发现一个熟悉的身影蜷缩在体育场入口处的阴影中。“安德罗波夫，你这个该死的蠢货！你他妈在这里干什么？！你的人呢？！”

The blond Russian militiaman wobblingly stood up and sloppily saluted Don Barceló with his cup, managing to only spill a little in the process. "Hellllooo, Don, sir," he slurred in barely recognizable Spanish. "Theses nice ladies invited us to their party. My mens are inside having some drinks. They've got good stuff!" Sergei's sloppy grin went perfectly well with his agreeable nodding at his own cheerful announcement. His smile vanished as Don Barceló leapt down from the hood of the HMMWV, rapidly strode over to right in front of him, and then pistol-whipped him across the face with his gun. Sergei staggered back a couple of steps and dropped his drink. He brought his hands up to his now bleeding nose and looked at the Don in some confusion. "You hit me," he said in tones of drunken bewilderment.

金发的俄罗斯民兵摇摇晃晃地站起来，用杯子向唐·巴塞洛草率地敬了个礼，过程中只洒出了一点。“哈喽，唐，先生，”他用几乎无法辨认的西班牙语含糊地说，“这些好心的女士邀请我们来参加派对。我的弟兄们已经在里面喝酒了。她们有好货！”谢尔盖那邋遢的笑容与他对自己喜讯的满意点头相得益彰。然而，当唐·巴塞洛从悍马车的引擎盖上跳下，快步走到他面前，并用枪托猛击他的脸颊时，他的笑容消失了。谢尔盖踉跄后退几步，手中的饮料也掉落在地。他双手捂住流血的鼻子，困惑地看着唐。“你打我，”他用醉醺醺的迷茫语气说道。

"Of course I hit you, you stupid little shit! Do you think I'm a fucking psychic?!"

我当然打你了，你个蠢小鬼！你以为我是他妈的通灵师吗？！

"Whuh...?" "啊...？"

"Do you think I'm a goddamn psychic?! Half my fucking men think it's time for a fucking fiesta down at the football stadium, and nobody reports it?!" He pointed at the floating billboard again. "And what the hell is that thing?! 'Free concert'?! Who the fuck is behind all this?!"

"你以为我是他妈的通灵师吗？！老子一半的混蛋手下都以为该去足球场搞个狂欢节了，居然没人报告？！" 他再次指向漂浮的广告牌，"那他妈的又是什么玩意儿？！'免费音乐会'？！这背后到底是谁在搞鬼？！"

"That would be me, Don Barceló," said a sultry voice in Japanese-accented Spanish from further in the darkened entryway behind them. Misato Katsuragi, wearing a tight chocolate-colored silk dress that would have gotten her arrested in some of the more polite parts of Tokyo 3, stepped from the shadows of the stadium's entryway into the daylight.

“那应该就是我，堂·巴塞洛，”一个带着日本口音的西班牙语声音从他们身后更深的昏暗入口处传来。葛城美里身着一件紧身的巧克力色丝绸连衣裙，这件衣服若在第三新东京市更为礼貌的地区穿着，恐怕会让她被逮捕，她从体育场入口的阴影中步入阳光之下。

Shinji's hand tightened on Asuka's. This was the part of the plan he did not like. Misato-san had to put herself in a fair amount of danger to get close enough for what she was supposed to do. Sergeant Bir and the other Imperials had assured him they had plenty of contingency plans in case anything violent happened, but Shinji couldn't help feeling fairly apprehensive at someone he cared about being that close to a strange tattooed man who thought a burst of sub-machine gun fire was a good conversation starter. He had to bite down on a shout when the barrel Don Barceló's sub-machine gun swung around to point at her face. His lunge forward to grab the barrier was arrested by Asuka's firm grip. She muttered in his ear, "Don't move, baka! You'll blow this whole thing! She knows what she's doing." Shinji would have felt more reassured if he hadn't heard her immediately mutter, "I hope."

真嗣紧握着明日香的手，这是他计划中最不喜欢的部分。为了执行她的任务，美里小姐不得不将自己置于相当大的危险之中。比尔中士和其他帝国士兵向他保证，他们有充足的应急计划以防任何暴力事件发生，但真嗣仍无法抑制对他在乎的人如此接近一个陌生纹身男子的担忧，尤其是那人认为用冲锋枪扫射作为开场白是件好事。当巴塞罗的冲锋枪枪口转向美里面庞时，他几乎要喊出声来。是明日香坚定的握力阻止了他冲向障碍物的动作。她在耳边低语：“别动，笨蛋！你会搞砸一切的！她知道自己在做什么。”如果明日香没有紧接着嘀咕一句“希望如此”，真嗣或许会感到更安心些。

Misato's eyes widened a bit as the gun snapped towards her, but she betrayed no other signs of fear. "My name is Misato, Don Barceló," she said smoothly. "But you can call me whatever you want. We are part of a new group in town and we wanted to announce ourselves with a big splash. If you will follow me, I'll take you inside and show you everything."

当枪口猛地指向自己时，葛城美里的眼睛微微睁大，但她并未流露出其他恐惧的迹象。“我叫葛城，堂·巴塞洛，”她流畅地说道，“不过你想怎么称呼我都行。我们是镇上新来的团体，想以一场轰动的方式亮相。请跟我来，我会带你进去，让你看个明白。”

"'Come into my parlour, said the spider to the fly'," Asuka muttered just loud enough for Shinji to hear. Misato made a half-turn away as if to lead him into the stadium entryway, but Don Barceló's other hand snapped out to grab her around the upper arm. He yanked her up against his body and pushed the muzzle of his gun up under her chin. Misato gave out an uncharacteristic squeal of distress and looked nervously down at the gun carefully without moving her head, her left hand flailing limply at the side of his neck.

"'来我的网里吧，蜘蛛对苍蝇如是说'," 明日香低声嘀咕，刚好让真嗣听见。美里半转身，仿佛要引领他进入体育馆入口，但唐·巴塞洛的另一只手突然伸出，抓住她的上臂。他猛地将她拽向自己，用枪口顶住她的下巴。美里发出一声不寻常的惊恐尖叫，紧张地低头看着枪，头不动，左手无力地在对方脖颈旁挥动。

"I don't think so, bitch," Don Barceló growled. "For some reason, I do not trust strange women who-..." the Don began, but trailed off to silence.

"我看未必，贱人，"唐·巴塞洛低吼道，"不知为何，我对那些来路不明的女人就是信不过……"唐说到一半，却戛然而止，陷入沉默。

There was a brief, still pause where no one moved. Shinji watched Misato breathe a sigh of relief and turn her head towards Sergei, suddenly ignoring the gun still pressed underneath her chin. "Sergei, be a good boy and go back inside with the others and get another drink," Misato ordered him gently. Her head turned back as Sergei nodded his head agreeably and stumbled his way back inside the stadium. "Don Barceló? Lower your weapon and take your hand off my arm." Misato's hand stayed on the side of his neck, as if she was gently caressing it. The Don silently complied with her instructions. Misato gave a small nod and started to smile. "Good. Now that we're all friends here, listen carefully..." she said quietly, her fingers idly stroking the small, pulsing indicator light on the casing of the Imperial pacifier she'd carefully placed on his neck right below his ear.

短暂的静默中，无人动弹。真嗣注视着美里松了口气，转头望向谢尔盖，全然不顾下巴下还顶着的枪。“谢尔盖，乖孩子，跟其他人一起回里面去，再喝一杯吧。”美里温和地命令道。谢尔盖点头同意，步履蹒跚地返回体育馆内。“堂·巴塞洛？放下武器，松开我的胳膊。”美里的手仍停留在他的脖颈旁，仿佛在轻柔抚摸。堂默默遵从了她的指示。美里微微点头，开始微笑。“很好。既然我们都是朋友了，仔细听我说……”她轻声细语，手指随意地摩挲着帝国安抚器外壳上那颗微弱跳动的小指示灯，它正巧妙地安置在他耳下颈间。

Shinji sighed in relief and made himself relax his worried grip on Asuka's hand a bit. A flicker of motion out of the corner of his eye made him turn to see Sergeant Bir lowering the sleek pistol Shinji hadn't even seen him raise. Sergeant Bir noticed his look and tapped the pistol as he re-holstered it on his hip. "I told you we wouldn't let anything happen, Lieutenant. She's got the pacifier on him now. He'll follow whatever instructions she gives him and is no longer even capable of harming her."

真嗣松了口气，稍稍放松了紧握明日香手的那份担忧。眼角余光中闪过一丝动静，他转头一看，只见比尔中士正将那把他甚至未曾察觉已被举起的流线型手枪放下。比尔中士注意到他的目光，一边将手枪重新插回腰间的枪套，一边轻敲着枪身说道：“我告诉过你，我们不会让任何事情发生，少尉。现在她已经给他戴上了安抚器。他会遵从她下达的任何指令，并且再也无法伤害到她了。”

They watched for a moment as Misato gave Don Barceló some specific instructions. When she finished, he turned and ordered his men to dismount, leave a minimum guard, and go inside to join the fiesta. A few of the more alert-looking guards gave him strange looks, but even they relaxed as he wrapped one arm around Misato's shoulders and smiled broadly. Misato gamely kept up the act, smiling and nodding right along with him. Shrugging his acceptance to his boss's odd orders, the commander of Don Barceló's guard company left a handful of guards with the vehicles as the rest trooped inside the stadium entranceway.

他们注视着，只见三佐向堂·巴尔塞洛下达了具体指示。待她交代完毕，他转身命令手下下马，留下最少警卫，并进入场内参加庆典。几名警觉的卫兵向他投去异样目光，但随着他一手搭在三佐肩上，露出宽厚的笑容，连他们也放松下来。三佐配合地维持着表演，与他一同微笑点头。尽管对老板的奇怪命令有些不解，堂·巴尔塞洛的卫队指挥官还是留下几名卫兵看守车辆，其余人则鱼贯进入体育场入口。

"Lieutenant Katsuragi and the Psi platoon will have them drugged up and handled in no time. A few 'free beers' offered by scantily dressed women will take care of those leftover guards. And on the off chance any of them are paranoid enough to turn those down, we'll congratulate them on their smarts and just nail them with the stunners," he continued. He raised his interface band and spoke into it. "Lieutenant Kaji, that's your cue, sir. Get your team in motion to the Casa Rosada and inform them of the change in city management."

葛城少尉和 Psi 小队很快就会让他们服下药物并处理妥当。几个穿着暴露的女性提供的“免费啤酒”就能搞定那些剩下的守卫。万一有人过于多疑拒绝接受，我们就夸他们聪明，直接用眩晕枪解决。”他继续说道。他举起接口带，对着它说：“加持先生，轮到你了，长官。让你的队伍前往玫瑰宫，并通知他们城市管理层的变动。”

Shinji couldn't hear Kaji's reply, but it satisfied Sergeant Bir. "We'll have a QRF on standby if you need backup, but there shouldn't be anything there your group can't handle, particularly Lieutenant O'Brien. Good hunting. Panther Seven out." He looked back up at Shinji and Asuka as he lowered his hand. "Once they've got ex-Don Barceló's command center, such as it is, occupied, that should put us in effective control of the city. Scout sections and some of the Support Platoon troops are taking control of the radio station and other city utility nodes, as much as are left. We're already tapped into the city power mains here, but they're dead. Doesn't look like there are any functioning power plants still feeding the city. Judging from the radiation scan we got when we passed the Atucha Nuclear Power Station on our way in, both reactor complexes fried themselves with a meltdown shortly after your Third Impact event. Pity, a working nuclear plant would have given us a power supply that could have simplified things here a lot. I'd rather not have to sideline one of our three mecha to use it as a power source, but that's an option. Maybe we can get one going out of some of our spare parts stockpile. Unfortunately, we didn't bring in a full spare engine for a StarStrider."

真嗣听不到卡吉的回答，但那让伯尔中士感到满意。"我们会有一支快速反应部队待命，以防你需要支援，但那里应该没有什么是你们小组处理不了的，尤其是奥布赖恩中尉。祝狩猎愉快。黑豹七号，通话结束。"他放下手，抬头看向真嗣和明日香。"一旦他们占领了前多恩·巴塞洛的指挥中心，尽管它简陋，那应该就能让我们有效控制这座城市。侦察分队和一些支援排的士兵正在接管广播电台和其他城市公用设施节点，只要还有剩余的。我们这里已经接入了城市的主电源，但它们已经断电。看起来似乎没有还在向城市供电的运转中的发电厂。根据我们进城途中经过阿图查核电站时进行的辐射扫描判断，两座反应堆综合体在你们第三次冲击事件后不久就因熔毁而自毁了。可惜，一个运转中的核电站本可以为我们提供一个能大大简化此地情况的电力供应。我宁愿不把我们三台机甲中的一台作为电源使用，但那是可行的选项。" 或许我们可以利用一些备用零件库存来组装一个。遗憾的是，我们没有带全套的星际飞翔者备用引擎。"

"Or an S2 Engine like they're using to power Berlin since we tore apart that Mass Production Eva during the coup," Asuka said. "Too bad we don't have one here. Maybe we can recycle the one in our MP Eva that's coming with the UN fleet. But that won't arrive for two months."

"或者像他们用来给柏林供电的那种 S2 引擎，毕竟我们在政变期间拆解了那台量产型 EVA。" 明日香说道，"可惜我们这里没有。或许我们可以回收我们那台量产型 EVA 中的 S2 引擎，它正随联合国舰队一起过来。但那要等两个月后才能到。"

'An S2 Engine... wait...' Shinji thought. "What about the one in Eva Unit-01?"

'一个 S2 引擎...等等...' 碇真嗣心想。"那初号机里的那个呢？"

Asuka and Sergeant Bir looked at him. "Eva Unit-01?" Sergeant Bir asked.

明日香和比尔中士看着他。“Eva 初号机？”比尔中士问道。

"Evangelion Unit-01. But you left it floating... Hell, I don't know where in deep space. Wherever it was that you recovered your mother that morning, Shinji," Asuka said.

“福音战士初号机。但你让它漂浮着……见鬼，我甚至不知道它在深空中的具体位置。无论那是哪里，你就是在那个早晨找回了你的母亲，真嗣。”明日香说道。

"Rayana brought it back with us when we first ah... teleported, I guess, back from someplace past Mars. She said she was just going to leave it parked at the L4 point until we figured out what to do with it. It should still be there," Shinji said.

“当我们第一次，呃……传送回来时，雷亚娜把它带回来了，我想，是从火星之外的某个地方。她说她打算先把它停在 L4 点，直到我们决定如何处理它。它应该还在那里，”真嗣说。

"And my Red Whirlwind is more than capable of a little trip to deep orbit like that," Asuka replied, eyes narrowing in thought. "We could go retrieve Eva Unit-01 and bring it right back here. Then we could tap it's S2 Engine right here, correct, Sergeant?"

"而我的'红色旋风'完全有能力进行那样一次深入轨道的短途旅行，"明日香回答道，眼中闪过思索的光芒，"我们可以去取回初号机，并将其直接带回这里。然后我们就能在这里直接利用它的 S2 引擎，对吧，中士？"

Bir nodded. "Yes, ma'am. The Support platoon shouldn't have much trouble getting some sort of patch set up to connect it to the city grid."

比尔点头道：“是的，女士。支援排应该不难搭建一套接口，以便接入城市电网。”

Asuka grinned triumphantly. "Well what are we waiting for, then? Come on, Shinji! Let's get into Red Whirlwind and go grab your old clunker! We'll have the lights on in this city in no time!"

明日香得意地咧嘴一笑：“那我们还等什么呢？快点，真嗣！让我们进入红色旋风，去取回你的老古董吧！很快这座城市就会灯火通明了！”

Shinji shrugged. "Better than just standing around here until Kaji and his team report back, I guess." 'And that means we'll be alone in Red Whirlwind for hours. Spending time alone with Asuka is rapidly becoming my favorite thing anyway. Oh gods, I can't wait for tonight.' A grin threatened to take over his face again as Asuka grabbed his hand and led the way towards the ramp down.

真嗣耸了耸肩。“总比在这里干等着卡吉和他的团队回来要好吧。”这意味着我们将独自在红色旋风号里待上几个小时。无论如何，与明日香独处的时光正迅速成为我最喜欢的时刻。哦，天哪，我迫不及待地期待今晚的到来。”当明日香抓住他的手，领着他走向斜坡时，他的脸上又差点露出笑容。

Part 49 第 49 章

It's Not Going To Be That Easy

没那么容易

Shinji Ikari considered himself a relatively reasonable man, after all he'd been through. He tried to look at all the reasons why things happened, and find the core truth of any conflict he found himself faced with. Given the mind-breaking events he'd been central to already in his short life, he sometimes considered it rather an achievement that he wasn't locked in a rubber room and arguing with invisible rabbits already. He tried to maintain a 'there is a reasonable explanation for this' approach to everything he faced.

碇真嗣自认为是个相对理性的人，毕竟他经历了那么多。他试图探究事情发生的原因，寻找自己所面对的任何冲突的核心真相。考虑到他短暂生命中已经身陷其中的那些令人崩溃的事件，他有时觉得，自己没有被关进精神病院与看不见的兔子争论，已经算是一种成就了。他努力保持一种“凡事皆有合理解释”的态度来面对一切。

None of which really helped when he once again found himself piloting a giant robot …again …with his girlfriend… correction, his lover, and heading into outer space to recover his previous giant robot so its infinite power supply could be used to power an entire city back on Earth.

当他再次发现自己驾驶着一台巨型机器人……又一次……与他的女友，更正，他的爱人一起，前往外太空去回收他之前的巨型机器人，以便利用其无限能量供应为地球上的整座城市供电时，这些帮助都不大。

Some days Shinji was rather amazed he wasn't wearing a custom straightjacket.

有些日子，真嗣颇为惊讶自己竟然没穿上特制的紧身衣。

Adding to today's weirdness, on top of all the aforementioned strangeness he was already engaged in, his as-of-yesterday-after-years-of-longing lover was apparently trying to give him a brainjob.

在今天这股怪异氛围中，除了他原本就参与的种种离奇之事外，他那经过多年渴望终于在昨天成为恋人的对象，显然正试图给他来一场脑力激荡。

The first time Shinji had been in Red Whirlwind, Asuka had seemingly been flirting with him via the mecha's AI through the mental link. Her thoughts had felt red, spiky, and hot. Now he was no longer flailing in confusion, theoretically trained up on how to operate the mecha they rode in, and his sense of Asuka through the mental link was much more clear. And no less confusing.

第一次进入红旋风时，明日香似乎通过机甲的 AI 借助精神链接与真嗣调情。她的思绪给真嗣的感觉是鲜红、尖锐且炽热。如今，他不再因困惑而手足无措，理论上已经训练有素，能够熟练操控他们所乘坐的机甲，通过精神链接感知到的明日香也更加清晰。然而，这并未减少他的困惑。

Asuka was… stroking him? Her mental impression kept warmly pulsing against Shinji over and over, undulating like an endless sea… or her supple body last night. He had distinct visual flashes of that image amidst the impressions of back-and-forth movement. It was… distractingly arousing. He tried to shake his head, to clear out the impression, but it just returned stronger than before. He clutched at the control grips and eyed Asuka's face through the comm window. The display was so sharp it was like looking though a gap in the air right into her face.

明日香在……抚摸他吗？她的心灵触感持续不断地温暖地涌向真嗣，如同无垠的海浪或昨夜她柔软的身躯般起伏不定。在来回的印象中，他清晰地闪现出那一幕。这感觉……令人分心且撩人。他试图摇头，驱散这印象，但它却比之前更加强烈地回归。他紧握操纵杆，透过通讯窗口凝视着明日香的脸庞。显示屏如此清晰，仿佛透过空气中的缝隙直视她的面容。

He tried to focus against the sensual, pulsating images that kept flooding at him across the link. "Asuka, what the heck are you doing?"

他努力集中精神，对抗着通过链接不断涌向他的感官刺激和跳动画面。“明日香，你到底在搞什么鬼？”

"Who, me, Shinji? I'm not doing anything. Just blasting into space in my unstoppable giant death robot with my boy toy. Just another day for the mighty and awesome Asuka Langley Sohryu." She grinned smugly.

“我，真嗣？我可没干什么。只是和我那小男友一起，驾驶着我的无敌巨型死亡机器人冲向太空。对于强大又了不起的惣流·明日香·兰格雷来说，这只是平常的一天。”她得意地咧嘴笑道。

'I've been demoted from 'boyfriend' and 'lover' to 'boy toy'?' he thought. 'Come on, Asuka. I'm not going to take a drop back like that sitting down. Alright, time for me to 'push back' again, I guess.' "Okay, fine. Take this…" He started to press back, carefully visualizing giving Asuka a slow, thorough back massage, fingers running up and down her back as lightly as possible.

他心想：“我从‘男友’和‘情人’被降级成了‘玩物’？”来吧，明日香，我可不会就这么坐以待毙。好吧，看来又到了我“反击”的时候了。“好吧，行。接招吧……”他开始回击，脑海中细致地想象着给明日香做一次缓慢而周到的背部按摩，手指尽可能轻柔地在她的背上上下游走。

Asuka jumped in the window, then her eyes slitted. She gave a very catlike purr. "Ooh, very nice, Shinji. So you can learn…"

明日香从窗户跳了进来，随即眯起了眼睛。她发出了一声猫般的咕噜声。“哦，很不错嘛，真嗣。看来你还是能学的……”

"I'm not a complete baka, you know. I do pay attention sometimes. You know, like when a certain redhead actually tells me something about what she's thinking."

我也不是完全的傻瓜，你知道的。我有时候还是会留意的。比如，当某个红发女孩真的告诉我她心里想的事情时。

"Yes, you are. Completely Baka-Shinji. You're a totally spineless marshmallow unless you're in an Eva. Or my new toy, it seems. Then all of a sudden you're a cocky jerk who's a lot more confident."

没错，你就是。彻头彻尾的笨蛋真嗣。除非你坐在 Eva 里，或者成了我的新玩具，否则你就是个毫无骨气的软棉花糖。一旦那样，你突然就变成了一个自大的混蛋，自信满满。

"We're both such different people in the cockpit, aren't we?" he asked, keeping up the push,

"我们在驾驶舱里都变得截然不同，不是吗？"他问道，继续保持着推力

"Ummm?" Asuka vaguely responded, her eyes losing focus and her mental impression easing back, receiving and riding his push rather than sending into his.

"嗯？" 明日香含糊地应了一声，眼神开始涣散，心神逐渐放松，顺从地接受并随他的推动而行，而非主动投入其中。

He let a small smile creep onto his face. "I'm more assertive and confident, doing the one thing I know how to do well besides playing the cello. You're in your element, doing what you've trained for your whole life. We're both more…whole than we are on the ground. A weird statement on us, don't you think?"

他让一丝微笑悄然爬上脸庞。“我变得更加果断自信，除了拉大提琴，这是我唯一擅长的事情。你则在自己的领域里，做着你一生所受训练的事情。我们俩都比在地面上时更加……完整。这话说得挺奇怪的，你不觉得吗？”

"Mmmm… Stuff the psychoanalysis and keep doing what you're doing, Third. Mmm… Gott, yessss…" Her eyes started to close in pleasure.

"嗯……别管什么心理分析了，继续保持，第三。嗯……上帝，是的……" 她的眼睛开始因愉悦而闭上。

Asuka's death glare at the flashing and beeping message alert was an impressive example even amongst the many he'd seen. Asuka's finger stabbed at the 'acknowledge' button like she was trying to kill it. "WHAT?!"

明日香对闪烁鸣响的信息提醒投去的死亡凝视，即便在他所见众多之中，也堪称惊人范例。她那根手指猛戳“确认”按钮的架势，仿佛要将其置于死地。“什么？！”

"Asuka? Ah… er… sorry, did I interrupt something?" Ching said from a new comm window.

“明日香？啊…呃…抱歉，我是不是打扰到什么了？”青从新的通讯窗口说道。

"Ching! You… Gott damn it, you have shitty timing." Asuka buried her frustration and got a grip on herself. "What is it?" she bit out.

"铛！你…该死的，你来的真不是时候。" 明日香压下心中的烦躁，努力控制住自己。"什么事？"她没好气地问道。

"Sergeant Bir just mentioned your trip to me, and I had a suggestion I think you should try out since you're up there already. Could you two kick in the jump drive on Red Whirlwind and head out-system for a few light-years? Try to contact the Empire once you're out that far, see if you can get through whatever is blocking us here."

伯尔中士刚向我提到了你们的行程，既然你们已经到了那里，我想提个建议你们不妨试试。你们能否启动“红色旋风”号的跳跃驱动器，向星系外航行几光年？试着在那样的距离外联系帝国，看看能否突破这里阻碍我们的障碍。

He knew he shouldn't do it. But it was too much fun, and he was feeling a bit fired up from last night. Shinji sent a pulse through the link, the feeling of Asuka sinking on to him that first time.

他明知不该这么做。但实在太有趣了，昨晚的兴奋劲儿还在心头萦绕。真嗣通过链接发送了一股脉冲，那是第一次与明日香交融的感觉。

Asuka's eyes went wide and her face red as she choked a reply back at Ching. "R-right! We'll… we'll do that. R-right away." He could feel her mingled arousal and annoyance through the link. He could almost hear the 'what are you, stupid?!' and indignant promise of revenge from Asuka. He smiled, adding in images of her bouncing on top of him last night.

明日香的眼睛瞪得大大的，脸颊涨得通红，她勉强回呛了程一句：“对……对！我们就……就那么办。马上。”通过链接，他能感受到她交织的兴奋与恼怒。他几乎能听见她那句“你傻吗？！”以及愤愤不平的复仇誓言。他微笑着，脑海中浮现出昨晚她在他身上欢快跳跃的画面。

Ching nodded. "Good. Let us know as soon as you get through if it works. Panther 5 out." Her window winked shut.

青点了点头。“好的，一旦成功就立刻通知我们。黑豹 5 号通话结束。”她的窗口随即关闭。

Asuka turned her glare on Shinji. "Gott damn it, Shinji! That wasn't funny! I'm trying to get rid of her and you almost made me c…." Asuka coughed in embarrassment. "Ahem, lose my composure."

明日香将怒视转向真嗣。“该死的，真嗣！这一点都不好笑！我正努力摆脱她，你差点让我……”明日香尴尬地咳嗽了一声。“呃，失态。”

Shinji smirked back at her. "Sorry. Next time I'll try harder. Can't have an 'almost' success on our record, can we?"

真嗣朝她咧嘴一笑：“抱歉。下次我会更努力的。我们的记录上可不能有‘几乎’成功这种事，对吧？”

"I will get you for this."

我会为此找你算账的。

"Promise?" His smirk faded as he thought over Ching's request. "You want to do that first? I think it will be easier to pick up Eva Unit-01 on the way back rather than try hauling it along."

"承诺？" 他想到程的请求时，嘴角的笑意逐渐消失。"你想先做那件事？我觉得回去的路上顺便捡起 Eva Unit-01 会更容易，而不是试图一路拖着它。"

Asuka looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded in agreement. "Yeah, let's try that first. Bringing the jump drive online. I'm aiming us just up and out of the plane of the system to just a couple of light-years out. Then we'll stop and try the comms."

明日香沉思片刻，随即点头同意。“好的，我们先试试这个办法。启动跳跃驱动器，我打算将我们直接提升到系统平面之外，距离几光年的地方。然后我们停下来尝试通讯。”

"Roger. Ready when you are."

"收到。随时待命。"

Shinji could hear the massive engines behind him spinning up, a nearly ultrasonic whine growing louder and louder. Asuka swung the nose of the StarStrider around until Luna hung in his lower left field of view, with the blood-colored Ring of Souls arcing at an angle across the sky. She brushed the controls for the jump drive with her fingers and waited for the moon to shoot away from their sight as they were suddenly elsewhere.

真嗣能听到身后巨大的引擎正在加速旋转，那近乎超声波的尖啸声越来越响。明日香操纵着星际飞船的机头转向，直到月球悬挂在他的左下方视野中，血色的灵魂之环斜贯天际。她轻触跳跃驱动器的控制杆，等待着月球从视线中消失，而他们将瞬间置身于另一处。

And waited. 然后等待着。

Asuka frowned in the comm window. She pressed the controls again more firmly, but the moon stayed right where it was and the halo of distortion from the drive his NILS training course on the mecha told him to expect did not materialize.

明日香在通讯窗口中皱起了眉头。她再次用力按下控制键，但月亮依旧纹丝不动，而根据 NILS 训练课程中机甲所教，本应出现的驱动器引起的扭曲光晕也未显现。

"Why isn't the jump drive engaging?" He asked her after a moment.

"为什么 U 盘没有反应？" 他过了一会儿问她。

"I don't know. I'm doing everything right. Maybe we're too close to Earth's gravity well, though that shouldn't affect it… hmm. I'll move us out a bit on the regular drives and we'll try again." She tilted the flight stick in her right hand forward and shoved the throttle control joystick in her left all the way up. Luna quickly zoomed closer.

"我也不清楚。我操作得没错。或许是我们离地球引力井太近了，尽管这本不该有影响……嗯。我先把我们往外挪一点，用常规推进器，然后再试一次。" 她将右手中的飞行操纵杆向前倾斜，同时将左手边的节流阀控制杆推至最高。月球迅速逼近。

They were just past lunar orbit when they were both suddenly thrown briefly forward against their body harnesses before the inertial damper kicked in. Something had abruptly slammed them to a complete halt. Something octagonal that turned the forward view brightly orange.

他们刚过月球轨道，两人突然被猛地向前抛出，撞在身体固定带上，随后惯性阻尼器才启动。有什么东西突然将他们完全拦停。那是一个八角形物体，令前方视野变得一片橙亮。

Shinji's eyes widened and he gasped. "An AT-Field! How…?"

真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他倒吸一口凉气。“一个 AT 力场！怎么会……？”

Asuka's eye's narrowed just as sharply. "I don't kn-….Wondergirl," she suddenly growled, her voice filled with loathing.

明日香的眼神同样锐利地眯了起来。“我不知……”她突然咆哮道，声音中充满了憎恶，“奇迹少女。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Who else could it be, Shinji? Who's the only entity left in this world who could do it? And who also has already demonstrated she's a stupid fucking tight-assed little bitch who doesn't like me?"

还能是谁，真嗣？这世上还有谁能做到这一点？而且谁已经证明了她就是个愚蠢至极、死板又讨厌我的小贱人？

Asuka swung the controls around again more viciously, trying to push through the AT-Field in their path. She revved Red Whirlwind's engines up higher and higher, pressing the mecha forward as strongly as she could, sliding them all around the limit of their advance. She got nowhere. The AT-Field blocking them was too strong for their own shields to erode to any useful extent. The immense orange octagons blocked them from getting any farther from Earth. Asuka snarled again in frustration and rage.

明日香再次猛烈地转动操纵杆，试图突破前方的 AT 力场。她将红色旋风的引擎加速至极限，竭尽全力推动机甲前进，不断试探着推进的极限。然而，一切努力皆是徒劳。阻挡他们的 AT 力场过于强大，以至于他们的护盾无法对其造成实质性削弱。巨大的橙色八角形屏障将他们与地球的距离牢牢锁定，无法再靠近半分。明日香因挫败与愤怒再次咆哮起来。

"Gott damn you, you snotty fucking blue-haired prig! I say Shinji's mine, and you decide you're going to pass judgment on us all like a fucking half-assed tin-pot god? You just can't accept that this is what we want? You don't get to rule my life you gigantic raging bitch! Shinji's free to choose whoever he wants! You're just pissed it wasn't you!" she screamed at the throbbing orange glow.

该死的你，你这满头蓝发、自以为是的混蛋！我说了真嗣是我的，你却自作主张像一个半吊子的破铜烂铁神一样对我们所有人评头论足？你就不能接受这就是我们想要的吗？你没资格掌控我的生活，你这个狂怒的巨型婊子！真嗣有权选择他想要的任何人！你只是因为那个人不是你而恼羞成怒罢了。她对着那跳动的橙色光芒尖叫道。

'Rei, why are you doing this?' Shinji thought. 'Asuka's probably right about this being you, but why?' Realizing Asuka's verbal tirade likely wasn't going to stop anytime soon unless he made her, he decided to try giving her something else to focus on. "Asuka, stop."

绫波，你为什么要这么做？' 真嗣心中疑惑。'明日香说的可能是对的，这就是你，但为什么呢？' 意识到明日香的言语攻击可能不会很快停止，除非他让她停下来，他决定试着给她找点别的焦点。"明日香，停下。"

"-gonna grab that Lance and shove it up your ass!" Asuka finally registered his voice and her eyes snapped back to his in the comm window. "What?! Why, Third?"

“-就要抓住那杆长矛，捅进你的屁股！”明日香终于听出了他的声音，她的目光猛地转回到通讯窗口中他的眼睛上。“什么？！为什么，老三？”

"I don't think you yelling at her is going to work. Let me try."

我觉得你对她大喊大叫不会有效果，让我来试试。

"Fucking bitch. Fine, go for it." Asuka ground out. She settled back into her harness and glared death at the glowing octagons.

"该死的贱人。好，去吧。" 明日香咬牙切齿地说道。她重新调整好安全带，恶狠狠地瞪着那些发光的八角形。

'Great. Now if only I had some idea of what to say, or confidence that she can hear me at all.' "Rei, are you there? Can you hear me?"

太好了。现在要是我知道该说什么，或者确信她能听见我就好了。' "绫，你在吗？你能听见我吗？"

His only answer was silence. The AT-Field faded out, but only because they were no longer pressing forward against it. They hung in space, drifting slowly backwards from their last rebound.

他唯一的回应便是沉默。AT 力场逐渐消散，但这只是因为他们不再向前推进与之抗衡。他们悬浮在空中，缓缓地从最后一次反弹中向后漂移。

"Rei, don't do this. We're trying to help people. I can do something to save lives! Don't stop us because you're angry at me or Asuka! Please!"

"绫，别这样。我们正试图帮助人们。我能够做些什么来拯救生命！不要因为你对我或明日香生气就阻止我们！求你了！"

He tried every comm channel the system had, even the external speakers, likely useless in the vacuum. Nothing got a response. After several minutes of fruitless effort, Asuka stopped him.

他尝试了系统中的每一个通信频道，甚至包括在真空中可能无用的外部扬声器。但没有任何回应。经过数分钟徒劳的努力后，明日香阻止了他。

"This is pointless, Shinji. It's pretty obvious Wonderbitch isn't listening. Fine. Let's go collect Eva Unit-01 and get back down where we can do some good. She's not going to help us." The acid bitterness in her voice could have cut steel. She twisted the flight stick around.

“这毫无意义，真嗣。很明显，那个‘神奇贱货’根本没在听。算了，我们去回收初号机，回到地面才能有所作为。她不会帮我们的。”她声音中的尖酸刻薄足以切开钢铁。她猛地扭动操纵杆。

'Is she right? Are you doing this because of us, Rei? Trying to 'protect me' from Asuka?' The faint red sparkle of the Ring of Souls offered no answer as Red Whirlwind swung back towards the L4 point.

她说的对吗？Rei，你这么做是因为我们吗？试图从 Asuka 那里‘保护我’？灵魂之环微弱的红色闪光没有给出答案，红色旋风号则朝着 L4 点回旋而去。

There was one more unpleasant surprise waiting for them when they arrived at the L4 point. Collecting Eva Unit-01 was simple. Asuka shifted the StarStrider back to humanoid mode and gathered the smaller Evangelion into their arms, cradling it in Red Whirlwind's arms like a child. But when Asuka reached out to grasp the slowly spinning Lance of Longinus, another angry orange octagon barrier sprang up before they could touch it. Asuka snarled another round of curses at Ayanami, and turned them back Earthwards.

当他们抵达 L4 点时，还有一个不愉快的惊喜在等着他们。收集 Eva 初号机很简单。明日香将星际行者切换回人形模式，将较小的福音战士揽入怀中，像抱孩子一样在红色旋风的怀抱中轻轻摇晃。但当明日香伸手去抓那缓缓旋转的朗基努斯之枪时，又一个愤怒的橙色八角屏障在他们触碰之前突然出现。明日香对着绫波丽又是一连串咒骂，随后转身向地球方向返回。

With Eva Unit-01 acquired, they'd slowly descended on contra-gravity to gently place it in a giant throne-like seat in one end of the stadium. Asuka carefully guided their mecha back to its parking spot at the other end of the stadium, shut it down, and rapidly slid out the hatch on its back. She practically flew down the temporary gantry their pit crew had set up, and had reached the ground almost before Shinji could even pull himself out of his own hatch. Once on the ground, Asuka threw her half-helmet at the foot of Red Whirlwind and resumed swearing at Ayanami with increasing inventiveness, pacing back and forth. When Shinji finally caught up with her she whirled on him, her eyes blazing with fury that was all too familiar from many previous encounters with Asuka's wrath.

获得 Eva 初号机后，他们借助反重力缓缓下降，将其轻柔地安置在体育场一端一个巨大的王座般的座位上。明日香小心翼翼地将他们的机甲引导回体育场另一端的停放位置，关闭了系统，并迅速从背部舱门滑出。她几乎飞一般地沿着维修团队搭建的临时通道冲下来，以至于真嗣还没来得及从自己的舱门中爬出，她就已经到达地面。落地后，明日香将半盔扔向红色旋风的脚下，开始更加有创意地咒骂绫波，来回踱步。当真嗣终于赶上她时，她猛地转身，眼中燃烧着怒火，这种熟悉的愤怒在以往多次遭遇明日香的怒火中已屡见不鲜。

"GRAAAH! The next time I get my hands on her, I'm going to belt her so hard they'll have to call it the Fourth Impact! Who does that uptight bitch think she is?!" she shouted at him and the world in general.

"嗷！下次我逮到她，非得狠狠揍她一顿，那得叫第四次冲击了！那个死板的女人以为自己是谁啊？！" 她对着他以及全世界咆哮道。

'At least this time it's not aimed at me,' Shinji tried to console himself. But now came the harder part: defusing the still exploding Sohryu. And he knew his track record on that was poor at best. Ok, so he was about zero for three hundred, but there was always next time, right? 'Which would be right now. Great.' He squared his shoulders and prepared to stick his foot in his mouth.

至少这次不是针对我，' 真嗣试图安慰自己。但现在更难的部分来了：平息仍在爆发的惣流。他知道自己在那方面的记录最多只能算糟糕。好吧，他大概是零胜三百负，但总会有下一次，对吧？那就是现在。太好了。' 他挺直肩膀，准备自找麻烦。

"Asuka-" "明日香-"

"No. Don't even start, Third. I'm already apocalyptically pissed at her. Don't even try to 'help' here, or I'm going to end up adding you to the target list. You always manage to say exactly the wrong thing. So just don't," she said, her voice suddenly icily calm.

“不，别插手，老三。我对她已经怒不可遏了。别试图‘帮忙’，否则我连你一起算账。你总是能说出最不合时宜的话。所以，什么都别说。”她的话语突然间冰冷而平静。

Shinji tried to think fast. He was more than certain 'I'm sorry' would get him killed. And just about anything else he usually said to her when Asuka was in a mood like this was just the wrong thing, like she said… but he still had to say something. It had just better be the right thing this time.

真嗣试图快速思考。他非常确定，一句“对不起”足以让他丧命。而平时在这种时候对明日香说的任何话，都像是她说过的那样，完全是错误的，但他仍然必须说些什么。这次，最好是正确的话。

"Asuka," he began. When her eyes narrowed dangerously, he hurriedly pressed on. "I'm with you."

"明日香，" 他开口道。见她眼神锐利起来，他急忙接着说："我站在你这边。"

She didn't rip his head off, but she didn't relax her fierce stare either. "Explain. Rapidly."

她没有撕下他的头，但也没有放松她那凶狠的瞪视。“解释。快点。”

"I chose this. I chose this and I'm not giving it up." He carefully reached out and took Asuka's hand, which she allowed. "Yesterday was the best day I've ever had. We talked, really talked, we danced, w-we…" He blushed. "We did the other stuff… I'm not giving up on that. Rei will have to accept that this is what I want. I still feel something for her, but…if she's doing this because she's mad at you, she's wrong. This is my choice too, and I refuse to give it up."

"我选择了这个。我选择了这个，我不会放弃。" 他小心翼翼地伸出手，握住了明日香的手，她默许了。"昨天是我有生以来最美好的一天。我们交谈，真正地交谈，我们跳舞，我们……" 他脸红了。"我们还做了其他的事……我不会放弃那些。绫波必须接受这是我想要的。我仍然对她有感觉，但是……如果她这么做是因为生你的气，那她错了。这也是我的选择，我拒绝放弃。"

Asuka gripped his hand back and appeared to calm down a shade from her boiling fury. "Pretty smooth, Baka-Shinji. Who are you and what having you done with the Third Child?"

明日香回握住他的手，似乎从她那沸腾的怒火中稍稍平静了一些。“挺会装的嘛，笨蛋真嗣。你到底是谁，你对第三适格者做了什么？”

"All that philosophy and logic is good for something, you know," he said, smiling slightly. The smile dropped away as he went on. "And she's not just affecting us with this. She's affecting everyone on the whole planet by being upset with us. That's just not right. So if you want to be mad at Rei, I'm not going to tell you you're wrong. I'm with you." The smile came back, stronger. "I'm yours until you say I can go, remember?"

“你知道，那些哲学和逻辑还是有用的，”他微笑着说。但随着他继续说下去，笑容消失了。“她不仅仅是因为对我们不满而影响我们。她因为对我们不满而影响了整个星球上的每个人。这就不对了。所以，如果你想对丽生气，我不会说你错了。我支持你。”笑容再次浮现，更加强烈。“记得吗？只要你不说让我走，我就是你的。”

Asuka colored a bit, this time not from anger. She looked away. "Baka."

明日香微微脸红，这次并非因为愤怒。她别过头去，轻声道：“笨蛋。”

She turned and started towards the tunnel off the field, pulling him along by their linked hands. "Let's go report this to the others. Come on."

她转身朝着田野旁的隧道走去，拉着他们紧握的手，拖着他前行。“我们去向其他人报告这件事。快点。”

"…so we headed back here. The pit crew is swarming over Eva Unit-01 right now, so they should be able to get it hooked up and producing power for us in short order. If the people in NERV-Berlin can hack it, I'm sure your people can figure it out."

…于是我们返回了这里。维修团队正忙于检修 Eva 初号机，相信他们很快就能将其连接并为我们提供电力。如果 NERV 柏林分部的人能破解，我相信你们的人也能搞定。

Sergeant Bir and Lieutenant Leibshott wore matching flat expressions as Asuka finished her report, but nodded. Sergeant Bir ran a hand over his crew cut and rubbed the back of his head. "Well, we can try sending Red Whirlwind back up tomorrow with just Lieutenant Leibshott at the stick. If it really is just about you and Ikari, maybe the Lieutenant alone can get through. Though judging by how hard and fast the portal was cut off here this morning, and what the Lieutenant remembers the Emperor saying about her apparently trying to prevent you from leaving that first time, I don't think we should get our hopes up. We've already had Lieutenant O'Brien try a few times to open a portal from this side. No joy. He says he can't even get any purchase at all. He had no luck on the mental or spiritual lines either, even just to get a message through. And if a Prince Of The Blood can't get even a crack from our end, we're down to either the Empire breaking through from their side or Ayanami dropping whatever this block is she's thrown up." Asuka was unsurprised at this point that he spoke perfectly fluent German. He looked at both of the Pilots and Ching. "I don't suppose any of you have a good idea what might get her to do that, or exactly why she's doing this in the first place?"

比尔中士和莱布斯托特中尉在明日香汇报完毕时，脸上挂着相同的平淡表情，却点了点头。比尔中士伸手抚过他的平头，揉了揉后脑勺。“好吧，我们可以尝试明天只让莱布斯托特中尉驾驶红色旋风号再次升空。如果问题真的只在于你和碇，或许中尉一个人能通过。不过，考虑到今早门户关闭得如此迅速且彻底，以及中尉回忆起皇帝关于她第一次试图阻止你离开的言论，我认为我们不应抱太大希望。我们已经让奥布赖恩中尉尝试了几次从这边打开门户，但毫无进展。他说他甚至无法取得任何进展。他在心理或精神层面也未能成功，连传递一条信息都做不到。如果一位皇室血脉的成员都无法从我们这边打开哪怕一丝缝隙，那我们只能寄希望于帝国从他们那边突破，或者绫波撤掉她所设置的这道屏障。”此时，明日香对于比尔中士能说一口流利的德语已不再感到惊讶。他看着两位驾驶员和青。 我想你们中没人知道有什么办法能让她这么做，或者她最初为什么要这么做吧？"

Asuka snorted. "Wondergirl is a sad, jealous bitch who can't stand seeing Shinji and I together."

明日香哼了一声。“那个‘奇迹女孩’就是个悲哀又嫉妒的贱人，见不得我和真嗣在一起。”

Sergeant Bir raised an eyebrow at this. So did Ching. "Do tell," she said.

比尔中士对此扬了扬眉毛，青也是。“说来听听，”她说。

"When we had that little meeting yesterday, she was practically undressing him with her eyes. I told her to knock it off. She said Shinji wasn't mine and that I didn't deserve him. That she'd treat him better! Like Hell! I told her he was mine, that he loved me, but she…" Asuka broke off. ''You do not love him. ... I will not let you hurt him. That is all you have ever done to him.'' She clenched her fists and tried not to grind her teeth. 'Damn you, Wondergirl. I don't know, Gott damn it! This just happened all of a sudden! Three days ago I hated him for all the times he'd failed me, but still wanted him to stay with me. Now… I don't know!' A nasty scrap of darkness deep in the back whispered 'She's right. You don't deserve him. Worthless…'

昨天我们那次小会面时，她简直是用眼神在给他宽衣解带。我叫她别这样了。她说真嗣不是我的，我不配拥有他，她会对他更好！简直是胡扯！我告诉她真嗣是我的，他爱我，但她……”明日香突然停住。“你不爱他。……我不会让你伤害他的。你对他所做的，从来都只是伤害。”她紧握拳头，努力不让自己咬牙切齿。该死的，奇迹女孩。我不知道，天杀的！这一切突然就发生了！三天前我还因为他屡次让我失望而恨他，但仍希望他留在身边。现在……我不知道！”内心深处一个阴暗的角落低语着：“她是对的。你不配拥有他。一无是处……”

"Lieutenant Sohryu? Are you all right?" Ching asked.

"相田中尉？你还好吗？" 青问。

Asuka shook herself. "I'm… fine. She said she would not tolerate Shinji and I together, or Shinji being taken where she couldn't see him. She was going to 'protect him', even from me, she said.

明日香摇了摇头。“我……没事。她说她不能容忍我和真嗣在一起，或者真嗣被带到她看不见的地方。她说她要‘保护他’，甚至从我这里保护他。”

Sergeant Bir sighed and looked over at Ching. "Family squabbles are ever so much fun when one party has god-like powers." He looked back at the Pilots. "She's the one that was the trigger for the 'Third Impact' event, controlled Instrumentality, et cetera, correct?"

比尔中士叹了口气，看向青。“当一方拥有神一般的力量时，家庭纷争可真是乐趣无穷。”他回头看向飞行员们。“她就是引发‘第三次冲击’事件、操控人类补完计划等等的那个人，对吧？”

Shinji blinked. "Yes. How did you know?"

绫波眨了眨眼。“是的。你怎么知道的？”

Bir nodded towards Ching. "Lieutenant Leibshott has been filling me in on the recent history of your world, with some help from Lieutenant Katsuragi. She's taken pains to stress that she was only telling me what was operationally necessary, and was keeping back sensitive details that pertained to you two for both professional and personal reasons." He threw a wry look at Misato, who was pretending to study the map on the battle table's display. "Although Lieutenant Katsuragi was only too happy to offer her own observations and speculations on that front at times. Some of them were very exotic and creative."

比尔向静点了点头。"莱布肖特中尉一直在向我介绍你们世界的近期历史，还有加藤中尉的一些帮助。她特别强调，她只告诉我操作上必需的信息，并保留了与你俩相关的敏感细节，这既有职业上的考虑，也有个人原因。"他向假装在研究战术桌上地图显示的葛城投去一个揶揄的眼神。"尽管加藤中尉有时非常乐意提供她自己的观察和猜测。其中一些非常奇特且富有创意。"

Asuka glared at Misato, who gave her a cheerful and unrepentant smile. "I wonder if I can get Kaji to spank you for that."

明日香瞪着美里，后者则回以一个欢快而无悔的微笑。“我在想，能不能让加持为了那事给你来个屁股开花。”

"Oooh, promise?" Misato cackled in response.

"哦哦，真的吗？" 葛城美里笑着回应道。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Ignore everything she said. Beer-soaked crazy talk, all of it, I'd bet."

明日香翻了个白眼。“别理她说的那些，全是啤酒灌出来的疯话，我敢打赌。”

"I'm shocked! You mean you and the First Child weren't sleepover buddies and pen-pals?" Ching asked with a smile.

"我太惊讶了！你是说你和长女并不是通宵好友兼笔友？" 青笑着问道。

"And I'm sure the part about you both flashing the penguin was completely unintentional, no matter what Lieutenant Katsuragi says," Sergeant Bir said.

"我敢肯定，你们俩对企鹅使眼色的那部分绝对是无意的，不管加藤木中尉怎么说，"比尔中士说道。

Asuka met Shinji's equally nonplussed look for a second, and then turned back to Sergeant Bir. "Ahem… er, yeah, total nonsense."

明日香与真嗣同样困惑的眼神对视了一秒，随后转回向比尔中士。“呃……嗯，完全是胡说八道。”

"Don't worry, Lieutenant. I kept her from getting too silly," Ching added. "Sergeant Bir is tracking on the Angels, the players involved, and the relevant parts of the Third Impact. Your personal business I kept out of it as much as possible." She looked down at her interface band. "In any case, it's getting on time for you two to be back aboard your ship so you can be seen for the evening. You should head off for the night, and we'll see you back here right after breakfast tomorrow."

"别担心，中尉。我没让她太离谱，"青补充道，"比尔中士正在追踪天使、涉事人员以及第三次冲击的相关部分。你的私事我尽量避开了。"她低头看了看自己的接口带，"无论如何，你们俩该回船上了，晚上还得露个面。你们应该去休息了，明早吃过早餐我们再见。"

Asuka gave Misato one last dirty look before nodding to Ching. "Right. I think I've had about enough crazy for one day as it is. You've got the watch until then, Lieutenant Leibshott?" At Ching's nod, Asuka took Shinji's hand again and started to lead him towards the transport pad. "We'll see you guys tomorrow. Goodnight." She tapped her band and they were elsewhere.

明日香在向葛城投去最后一瞥不满的目光后，向青点了点头。“好吧，我觉得今天已经够疯狂了。那么，中尉莱布施托特，你负责守望到那时？”在青点头确认后，明日香再次牵起真嗣的手，开始引领他走向运输平台。“我们明天见，各位。晚安。”她轻触手环，两人随即消失在别处。

### Chapter 27 Kung Fu Flirting Redux - Judge & Jury
 
ven once they were alone in their cabin aboard ship, Asuka could not relax. She'd been snappish and curt to the few crew of the ship they'd seen when they picked up dinner trays, and even after the poor meal could not sit still. Her anger at Ayanami kept her practically bouncing off the walls. She ended up pacing back and forth in the limited space until Shinji had looked up from a virtual book on his interface band to ask if she'd like him to play something on his cello for her.

即便在船舱内独处，明日香仍无法放松。她对那些在取晚餐托盘时遇到的寥寥几位船员态度尖刻，即便面对那顿糟糕的饭菜，她也坐立不安。对绫波的怒气让她几乎要撞墙。她最终在有限的空间里来回踱步，直到真嗣从他的界面带上抬起头，从虚拟书籍中抽身，询问她是否愿意听他拉一段大提琴。

She'd almost leapt on the offer, and now tried to cool her jangling nerves by lying on the bed as he played a nice Beethoven piece for her. She did feel calmer listening to the smooth, somber notes of his playing. His music always soothed her. Peaceful memories of lying in her bed in Misato's apartment listening to him play had been one of the few pleasant things she'd held to her heart to comfort herself with in the darkest days of her time as Winthrop's plaything, though even now she could hardly think of anything that would make her actually tell Shinji that. Somehow, even after what they'd already said to each other, sharing the fact that memories of him had been her lifeline in her worst days still felt like exposing too much of a vulnerability. And even at the moments it didn't, all the unresolved and unforgiven anger she still held towards the Third Child would come rushing in to swamp any thinking that she might.

她几乎是一跃而起接受了提议，此刻正躺在床上，试图通过他为她演奏的一曲优美的贝多芬来平复自己紧张的神经。听着他那流畅而沉郁的演奏，她的确感到了一丝平静。他的音乐总能抚慰她。躺在美里公寓的床上，聆听他演奏的宁静回忆，是她作为温思罗普玩物时最黑暗日子里，少数珍藏于心、用以慰藉的美好事物之一。尽管如此，她几乎想不出有什么能让她真正向真嗣吐露这些。不知何故，即便他们已经彼此坦诚，分享那些关于他的记忆曾是她最艰难时刻的救命稻草，这仍像是暴露了太多脆弱。即便在那些不觉得如此的时刻，她对第三适格者仍未释怀、未原谅的怒火也会汹涌而至，淹没她所有的思绪。

When he reached the end of the piece, Shinji paused and looked up at her to see if she wanted more. Asuka did feel calmer, but the line of thought she'd been following wouldn't let go. She knew this was something they'd have to face, and letting it fester would just taint what happiness she might have enjoyed until she did. She didn't want to just throw something like this out between them after the great day they'd had yesterday, but the day had already been brought down from the sunny start it had had when they were cut off from the Empire by Wonderbitch. She gave herself a mental shake, and decided it might as well be now. She rolled onto her side and looked Shinji right in the eye.

当真嗣弹完那曲，他停下并抬头望向她，看她是否还想继续。明日香确实感到平静了些，但她所思索的问题仍挥之不去。她明白这是他们必须面对的，任其发酵只会玷污她本可享受的幸福，直到真正面对它。她不想在昨天美好的一天之后，就这样把问题抛在他们之间，但自从被 Wonderbitch 切断了与帝国的联系后，这一天已从阳光明媚的开端变得黯淡。她内心一震，决定不如就现在解决。她侧过身，直视着真嗣的眼睛。

"I still hate you, you know," she said quietly, almost emotionlessly.

"你知道的，我依然恨你，" 她轻声说道，几乎不带任何感情。

Shinji jerked his head back in surprise. But after a few seconds of shocked silence, his expression changed to sad understanding. He just nodded at her.

真嗣惊讶地猛然抬头。但几秒钟的震惊沉默后，他的表情转为悲伤的理解。他只是向她点了点头。

"You're mine and I want you right next to me… but I'm still so angry you weren't there too many times before, that you didn't have the guts to do this years ago. You confuse me, Th- Shinji. One minute you're a spineless wimp that makes me sick to be around, then you tell me… you love me… but there's still so much to forgive."

你是我的，我要你就在我身边……但我仍然对你之前太多次不在而感到愤怒，你没有勇气在多年前就做出这样的决定。你让我困惑，真嗣。一分钟前你还是个让我难以忍受的懦夫，然后你告诉我……你爱我……但还有太多需要原谅。

"I know," he said just as quietly.

"我知道，" 他同样轻声说道。

"'I know'?" Asuka said after a minute dragged on with nothing further from him. "That's all?"

"‘我知道’？" 过了好一会儿，见他再无下文，明日香开口道，"就这些？"

"What do you want me to say, Asuka? I know all too well how much pain I caused you too many times. My paralysis cost you your life. I…" His eyes dropped away from hers for a moment, but came back after a visible struggle. "You want me to protest? Claim its unfair? Yell at you that you've done just as much to me? I'm well aware of my sins."

"你想让我说什么，明日香？我太清楚自己多少次给你带来了痛苦。我的瘫痪让你失去了生命。我……" 他的目光从她的眼睛移开了一瞬，但经过明显的挣扎后又回到了她的视线中。"你想让我抗议吗？声称这不公平？对你大喊你也对我做了同样的事？我深知自己的罪孽。"

'Yes, damn it. Fight back at me, Shinji! Don't be a Gott damn doormat! Push back at me! Look at me!' "Haven't I? Done as much?"

是的，该死的。反击我，真嗣！别当个该死的受气包！反抗我！看着我！" "难道我没有吗？做得还不够吗？"

"You didn't decide to end the world, Asuka. I did."

你并没有决定要终结这个世界，明日香。是我决定的。

"And then you pulled back. And are you going to try and tell me with a straight face that I didn't contribute to your choosing that at first? I'm the one who said 'No' when you asked… begged for help."

然后你退缩了。你打算一本正经地告诉我，最初做出那个选择时我没有一点影响吗？是我，在你请求——甚至可以说是乞求帮助时，说了“不”。

He stared at her with that oddly intense look again. It made her wonder if she'd said something that would finally bring out the Pilot Ikari who she saw through the comm window, the cocky and determined Evangelion Pilot who hammered Zeruel into submission, who rode unafraid with her into Gaghiel's jaws, who caught and held the plunging Sahaquiel by himself until she and Ayanami helped kill it. That she'd finally be face-to-face in the flesh with the boy who'd leapt into a volcano without a moment's hesitation to save her, instead of forever seeing him only on the other side of a comm screen into a Entry Plug. She really wanted to finally meet him…

他再次以那种异常专注的眼神凝视着她，让她不禁思索，是否自己说了什么话，终将引出透过通讯窗口所见的那个碇真嗣——那位自信而坚定的福音战士驾驶员，曾将力天使萨基尔击溃，无畏地与她一同冲入鱼天使加吉尔的巨口，独自一人抓住并牵制住坠落的空天使萨哈魁尔，直至她与绫波丽助其终结。她渴望着，能真正面对面地见到那个毫不犹豫跳入火山只为救她的少年，而非永远隔着通讯屏幕，望着插入栓另一端的他。她真心期盼着与他相遇的那一刻……

He had that same steady gaze as he looked at her now, even as his voice had a note of confusion. "Asuka… are you… trying to take some of the blame for what came next?" He looked at her like he couldn't believe what he was hearing.

他此刻凝视她的眼神依旧坚定，尽管声音中带着一丝困惑：“明日香……你是在……试图为接下来发生的事承担一部分责任吗？”他看着她，仿佛不敢相信自己所听到的。

'Am I? What the Hell amI asking here? Why the Hell am I asking this?' "You can't tell me what I said wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back, can you? You… Why don't you hate me back? I hurt you more than anyone. Why don't you hate me?"

我这是在问什么鬼问题？我为什么要问这个？" "你不能否认我说的那些话不是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，对吧？你……为什么你不恨我呢？我伤你比谁都深。为什么你不恨我？"

"You touched my face." 你触碰了我的脸。

She just stared at him. Neither of them liked to bring up the memory of that blood-colored beach. As her vicious, panicked reaction in their first judo match had shown them both, the scars from that awakening still lingered raw and fresh, even years later. So why…?

她只是盯着他。两人都不愿提起那血色海滩的记忆。正如他们在第一次柔道比赛中她那激烈而恐慌的反应所揭示的，那次觉醒留下的伤痕依旧鲜活如初，即便多年过去。那么，为什么……？

After a second he went on, seeing she was still looking for him to explain. "You touched my face… Yes, it hurt so much it pretty much broke my mind when you said that. I was in the middle ofchoking you to death, nothing left in me but rage and pain… and you touched my face. One little caress. You… Asuka, no one, no one had ever acknowledged my pain like that before. You… understood. And showed that you felt it. At my lowest point… I… don't think I could ever hate you again after that, no matter what." His look softened a little, a tiny smile forming. "Plus there's the part where you're the stunningly beautiful, incredibly brilliant, amazing girl of my dreams that I'm in love with…"

过了一会儿，他继续说道，意识到她仍在等待他解释。"你触摸了我的脸……是的，当你那么说时，那痛楚几乎让我崩溃。我正要掐死你，心中只剩下愤怒和痛苦……而你触摸了我的脸。一个小小的抚摸。你……明日香，以前从未有人像那样承认过我的痛苦。你……理解了。并表达了你的感受。在我最绝望的时刻……我想，无论发生什么，我再也无法恨你了。"他的表情柔和了一些，嘴角露出一丝微笑。"再加上，你是那个令我倾倒的梦中女孩，美丽绝伦、才华横溢，我爱着你……"

"Baka. Of course I am." Asuka tried to preen like she used to, but found her heart wasn't in it. It was different, knowing he utterly truly meant it. Now hearing something like that was almost terrifying.

"傻瓜。我当然是。" 明日香试图像往常一样自鸣得意，却发现自己的心不在焉。知道他是完全真心实意地说出这话，感觉已经不同了。现在听到这样的话，几乎让人感到害怕。

"You break me open, Asuka. Nobody gets at me like you. I… I charged at the 12th Angel because you challenged me. I don't think I'd have managed half of the things I did fighting the Angels without you pushing me. I can be angry with you for hurting me, but I can't hate you. You challenge me…. you make me move. I threw in with the coup because of you, because of what the world I was responsible for was doing to you. You practically had to beat me over the head to get me to do it, but you got me to fight in Berlin because you reminded me I owed you a life. You got me to finally tell you how I felt about you. I asked you to dance because you made me want to. You tell me I can't be nothing because you won't have it… and that works. I'd probably still be sitting on that beach if not for you."

你让我彻底敞开心扉，明日香。没有人能像你这样触及我。我……我冲向第十二使徒是因为你向我发起了挑战。如果没有你不断推动我，我想我在与使徒的战斗中做不到那么多。我可以因为你伤害了我而生气，但我无法恨你。你挑战我……你让我行动起来。我参与政变是因为你，因为那个我负责的世界对你所做的一切。你几乎得把我打醒才能让我去做，但你让我在柏林战斗，因为你提醒我欠你一条命。你让我终于向你坦白了我的感情。我邀请你跳舞是因为你让我想要这么做。你告诉我不能一事无成，因为你不会允许……而这奏效了。如果没有你，我可能还会坐在那片海滩上。

'And you, Third Child, keep doing things like this. You used to be so easy to is not what I expected. I just wanted to remind you and myself that there's still a lot of blood and problems between us. Instead I got… this.' Asuka noticed for the first time her breath was heaving and her heart was pounding. She couldn't tell if she wanted to throw a punch at him or drag him down onto the bed and rip his clothes off. She was furious at him, furious at Wondergirl, she wanted him, she wanted to apologize to him, she wanted to cling to him and demand love and reassurance. The net result of all the swirling emotions left her paralyzed on the bed, watching him.

而你，第三适格者，继续这样行事。你曾是多么单纯，这出乎我的意料。我只是想提醒你我，我们之间还有许多血债和纠葛。结果却……如此。' 明日香第一次注意到自己的呼吸急促，心跳如鼓。她分不清自己是想给他一拳，还是将他拽到床上撕扯他的衣物。她对他怒火中烧，对那个完美女孩也怒不可遏，她渴望他，想要向他道歉，想要紧抱他索求爱与慰藉。所有纷乱的情绪交织在一起，让她僵卧在床上，凝视着他。

His right hand was starting to do his pre-battle rhythmic clenching, and she could almost sense the nervousness increasing in him, but he still kept that steady look on her. "I… want to apologize… for balking during the fight in Berlin. I almost made the same mistake again, letting my own selfishness dump the burden of my choices on others. I don't want to risk hurting civilians, so I was ready to give up and let a war go on that would hurt even more, but as long as it wasn't directly on my hands, it was ok…" He sighed. "I never liked being a Pilot, Asuka. I truly hated it after what happened to Touji. And then there was the Third Impact… I don't like hurting people, Asuka, and I hate even the thought of killing. I had too much innocent blood on my hands already. I didn't want more. But you were right. Putting my personal conscience above what it would cost… especially that it would cost you… you knocked me out of it. It was the fact it would hurt you that tipped it. Thank you."

他的右手开始做起了战前有节奏的握拳动作，她几乎能感觉到他内心的紧张在加剧，但他依然保持着沉稳的目光注视着她。“我……想要道歉……因为在柏林战斗中退缩了。我差点又犯了同样的错误，让自己的自私把选择的负担推给了别人。我不想冒险伤害平民，所以我准备放弃，任由一场会伤害更多人的战争继续，只要不是直接由我造成……”他叹了口气。“我从来不喜欢当驾驶员，明日香。在东治出事后，我更是深恶痛绝。然后是第三次冲击……我不喜欢伤害人，明日香，连杀人的念头都让我厌恶。我手上已经沾染了太多无辜者的鲜血。我不想再添新的。但你是对的。把个人良知置于可能付出的代价之上……尤其是那代价可能是你……你让我清醒了。正是那会伤害到你的事实让我改变了主意。谢谢你。”

'Selfish mistakes, Shinji? I almost made you end the world because I didn't believe you really wanted to reach out to me. Then I gave myself to Winthrop to save my own neck and damn yours. I almost killed myself because I couldn't stand the pain of watching my mother die again and the endless strain of waiting for the day BABYKA decided I was a threat to security and shot me. If I'd succeeded, I'd never have seen Mama again. You stopped me.' But aloud she only growled, "If we hadn't been soaking in LCL, I'd have knocked it out of you directly, Third." She tried to sound flippant. "You're going to be right next to me from now on, so you'd be risking me again. Don't do that again. But don't worry. I'm always willing to beat some sense into your thick head."

自私的错误，真嗣？我差点因为你没让我相信你真心想与我沟通而让你毁灭世界。然后我为了自保委身于温斯洛，却置你于不顾。我差点自杀，因为我无法忍受再次目睹母亲离世的痛苦，以及等待 BABYKA 判定我为安全威胁并射杀我的无尽压力。如果我成功了，我将再也见不到妈妈。是你阻止了我。”但她只是低吼道：“如果我们不是浸泡在 LCL 中，我早就直接把你打醒了，第三适格者。”她试图显得轻描淡写，“从今往后，你得紧挨着我，所以你又在冒险牵连我。别再这样了。不过别担心，我随时都乐意给你这榆木脑袋敲敲警钟。”

"Even I get a hint eventually. Especially when you hit me over the head with it."

连我最终也能察觉到一丝端倪。尤其是当你直接用它敲打我的头时。

She smirked at him. "Or throw you across a judo mat?"

她朝他咧嘴一笑：“还是把你摔在柔道垫上？”

"That worked too. I think I just kind of sat there for about an hour before I could even move."

那也奏效了。我想我大概就那样坐在那里，大约一个小时后才能动弹。

"Aww, did I break something?"

"哎呀，我是不是弄坏了什么？"

"Just my brain." He looked out the tiny porthole over her head in the wall above the bed at the full moon. "And now Ayanami is breaking my heart."

"只是我的大脑。" 他透过她头顶上方床头墙壁上的小舷窗，望向满月。"而现在，绫波正在撕碎我的心。"

Her face twisted back into a scowl. "Good job, Third. You were doing so well in getting my mind off Wonderbitch."

她的脸又扭曲成一副怒容。“干得好，老三。你可真擅长让我不去想那个神奇贱人。”

"I'm sorry. It's just… there was a time when knowing Ayanami cared about me this much would have made me happy. It would have been something I welcomed. Now… I don't know whether to be angry at her for putting us all in danger or sad that she just doesn't understand. I wonder if she even can," he said sadly.

“对不起。只是……曾经有一段时间，知道绫波如此关心我，会让我感到幸福。那是我所期盼的。但现在……我不知道是该对她将我们置于危险中感到愤怒，还是为她根本不理解而感到悲哀。我在想，她是否真的能够理解，”他悲伤地说道。

Asuka rolled her eyes a bit. "Well she damn well better learn. We need to talk her into stopping this shit and soon, because I just claimed you and I'm not just giving you up on her say-so. You're mine." 'Don't love him… don't deserve him…' echoed Ayanami's voice in her head.

明日香略微翻了个白眼。“她最好赶紧学会。我们得说服她停止这种破事，而且要快，因为我刚刚宣布你是我的，不会仅凭她一句话就把你让出去。你是我的。”不要爱他…不配拥有他…”绫波的声音在她脑海中回响。

She shook her head once, sharply, then re-locked eyes with Shinji. He was still looking at her that way… She'd never had this Shinji in front of her in person before. Maybe it was time to take a chance herself. Years of reflexive fear keeping anyone from knowing what she was really thinking warred with the desire broken loose by the last couple of day's shocks to tell Shinji things she'd had on her mind for years, and lost. 'Come on, Sohryu. Take the chance for once in your life!' She cleared her throat nervously.

她猛地摇了摇头，随即再次与真嗣对视。他依旧那样看着她……她从未在现实中面对过这样的真嗣。或许，是时候自己冒险一试了。多年来，本能的恐惧让她从未让人窥见自己真正的想法，而这两天接二连三的冲击却让她的渴望挣脱束缚，想要告诉真嗣那些积压心头多年的思绪，那些已逝去的东西。来吧，惣流，就这一次，抓住机会吧！她紧张地清了清嗓子。

"I… after you came back from being stuck inside Eva Unit-01 for a month, I saw you and Wondergirl at the train station. You were talking with her, looking at her, and… you looked happy. I… I thought I'd… 'lost' you to her. I think… I think that's where it started to go bad for me. It made me depressed, my synch rate started to drop, which made me feel worse, which accelerated it… a nice little vicious feedback cycle. And then even she passed my synch rate…. Gott, I hated her then. Surpassing me at Piloting, the thing that defined my life… taking you away from me… I didn't even realize how much I wanted you until then… That's why I told her to stop looking at you like that. I couldn't stand the idea of it all happening again. You're mine. Not hers."

在你被困在 Eva 初号机一个月后回来的那天，我在火车站看到了你和 Wondergirl。你们在交谈，你看着她，看起来很开心。我……我以为我……失去了你给她。我想……我想那就是我开始变得糟糕的地方。这让我陷入了抑郁，同步率开始下降，这让我感觉更糟，从而加速了这一过程……一个恶性循环。然后，就连她也超越了我的同步率……天啊，那时我恨她。在驾驶上超越我，这是我生命的定义……把你从我身边夺走……直到那时我才意识到我有多么想要你……这就是为什么我告诉她不要再那样看着你。我无法忍受这一切再次发生。你是我的。不是她的。

Shinji looked at her with more than a little surprise, like the notion that she'd wanted him back then was almost too foreign to contemplate. Unable to say anything to that, he answered instead about Ayanami. "I'd always felt a connection with her. She was someone who I… I wasn't scared to talk to. You… I remember that conversation at the train station, it was right after I left the hospital. You know what I was talking to Rei about?"

真嗣带着几分惊讶看着她，仿佛她曾希望他回来的想法陌生得几乎难以想象。他无言以对，转而谈起了绫波。“我总觉得与她有种联系。她是那种我……我不害怕交谈的人。你……我记得在火车站的那次对话，那是我出院后不久。你知道我当时和绫波在聊什么吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

"You." 你。

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

Shinji continued. "I was asking her about you, where you were. I… you were there when I woke up after coming out of the 12th Angel, even if you were sort of hiding in the hallway. It made me laugh." He smiled softly. "I was wondering why I didn't see you this time, after I'd been gone so much longer. I… wanted to see you."

真嗣继续说道：“我当时在问她你在哪里，你之前在我从第十二使徒那里醒来后出现过，哪怕只是躲在走廊里。那让我笑了。”他温柔地微笑着，“这次我离开得更久，却没见到你，我……很想见你。”

Asuka winced internally, then lashed out. "Gott damn it, Third! Why didn't you say something?! " she barked at him.

明日香内心一紧，随即爆发了。“该死的，第三！你为什么不说点什么？！”她冲他吼道。

Shinji responded to her anger by heating up a little himself. "Why didn't you?! I was scared to say anything to you, Asuka! You were so damn alive, so beautiful, it scared me to try even talking to you beyond plain day-to-day stuff!" He broke off, and looked away. "Asuka, you are the most beautiful girl I've ever met. I was afraid to touch you, talk to you, because I always felt like everything we said to each other had so much more weight than talking to anyone else that it was like a mine field. I was so attracted to you, but I had no idea what to do about it! It almost hurt to look at you, live with you every day, and not have you. When you kissed me, I was scared! I wanted more so bad I froze because I was scared of doing anything that might stop it!"

真嗣对她的怒气做出了反应，自己也有些激动起来。“为什么我不敢？！我害怕对你说任何话，明日香！你那么充满生机，那么美丽，我连和你谈些日常之外的事情都感到害怕！”他停了下来，转过头去。“明日香，你是我见过的最美丽的女孩。我害怕触碰你，和你交谈，因为我觉得我们之间的每一句话都比和其他人说话要沉重得多，就像走在雷区一样。我被你深深吸引，却完全不知道该如何是好！每天看着你，和你生活在一起，却无法拥有你，这几乎让我感到痛苦。当你吻我时，我害怕极了！我如此渴望更多，却因为害怕做错任何事而僵住了，生怕那一切会停止！”

His anger blew itself out as quickly as it had arisen. His eyes lost the steady look and started to dart away from hers. "You were a fireball of confidence and energy, and I was nothing, nobody, just Baka-Shinji."

他的怒气来得快去得也快，眼中的坚定逐渐消散，开始避开她的目光。“你曾是自信与活力的火球，而我什么都不是，只是个愚蠢的真嗣。”

'No, damn it. Not now.' Asuka could see his eyes starting to drop away, the forceful Pilot Ikari fading back into the doormat 'Baka-Shinji', and hated it. She finally had the Ikari she'd wanted to meet in front of her. She wasn't going to let him slip away. She could hardly deny that having this Shinji within arm's reach was at least as much a part of what was making her heart pound as the anger was.

不，该死。别现在。'明日香能看见他的眼神开始游离，那个强势的碇真嗣飞行员正逐渐退回成懦弱的'笨蛋真嗣'，这让她厌恶至极。她终于得到了她一直想见的那个碇真嗣。她绝不会让他溜走。她几乎无法否认，这个触手可及的真嗣，至少和愤怒一样，是她心跳加速的原因之一。

He turned away to place his cello in its case. When he turned back around she grabbed his hand hard enough to make his eyes widen again. "No. I told you none of that, Ikari. You're not 'nothing' to me, and I'm not… perfect." 'Worthless…' She ignored the voice and pushed on. "I want you, this you, right here. The Shinji who jumped into Mount Asama to save me, not the wimp who folded up when I was fighting for my life. I want the Shinji who wants me, who loves me, and can say it to my face. If I'm going to be in command of this forlorn hope while we take on the whole world, I'm going to need you to be a damn hero, the one I know you can be at the most irritating of times. That's why you annoy me so much, Third. I know you can be. I've seen you do it! You were everything I could want last night. That's why it pisses me off when you don't! So you'd better be everything I've seen you be, or I'm going to make you into a hero!"

他转身将大提琴放入琴盒。当他再次转过身时，她紧紧抓住他的手，力度之大让他再次瞪大了眼睛。“不，我告诉过你，那些都不是真的，碇。你对我来说绝非‘无足轻重’，而我也不是……完美的。”她无视了内心的那个声音，继续说道：“我要的是你，现在的你，就在这里。是那个为了救我而跳进浅间山的真嗣，而不是在我为生存而战时退缩的懦夫。我要的是那个渴望我、爱我，并能当面对我表达的真嗣。如果我要带领这支绝望的队伍对抗全世界，我需要你成为一个真正的英雄，那个在最恼人的时刻我知道你能成为的英雄。这就是你让我如此恼火的原因，第三适格者。我知道你能做到。我亲眼见过！昨晚的你就是我想要的一切。这就是为什么当你做不到时我会生气！所以你最好展现出我所见过的你的一切，否则我会把你打造成一个英雄！”

Shinji would have taken a step back, but her ironclad grip on his hand didn't loosen a hair. He settled for a wide-eyed stare at her panting lips and heaving chest. It took a moment before he could tear his eyes away from that last distracting location and meet her gaze again. "'Make me into a hero'?" he asked, his voice hovering between indignation at her accusation and curiosity. He tried to pull his hand away, but her hand only tightened. His eyes narrowed. "Do I get any say in this?" he asked, anger rising a bit in his tone. His pulling suddenly became a jerk, and he spun her around until her arm was pulled up behind her. "I don't even get to decide who I am?"

真嗣本想后退一步，但她那铁钳般的手紧紧抓住他的手，丝毫未松。他只能睁大眼睛，盯着她喘息的嘴唇和起伏的胸膛。过了好一会儿，他才勉强将视线从那令人分心的部位移开，重新与她对视。"'把我变成英雄'？"他问道，声音介于对她指控的愤慨与好奇之间。他试图抽回手，但她的手反而握得更紧。他的眼神变得锐利。"我在这件事上有没有发言权？"他质问，语气中带着些许怒意。突然间，他用力一拉，将她旋转过来，直到她的手臂被反扭在背后。"我连自己是谁都不能决定吗？"

Asuka tried to suppress the sharp grin that curled her lips for a moment, then abandoned the effort. 'If you can find the spine to push back against me that much, so much the better, Shinji.' She swung her legs up and used the close wall of their small cabin as a springboard to launch herself over his shoulder, breaking free of his grip in the process. She kicked at the back of his knee to drop him, but he'd already begun to turn and dodged the blow. They both brought their hands up into guard positions.

明日香试图压制住嘴角那一瞬勾起的狡黠笑容，但很快放弃了努力。'如果你有勇气这样反抗我，那再好不过了，真嗣。'她双腿一摆，利用狭小舱室紧贴的墙壁作为跳板，从他肩头翻越而过，顺势挣脱了他的抓握。她瞄准他膝盖后方踢去，试图让他跪下，但他已开始转身，巧妙地躲开了这一击。两人随即举起双手，进入防御姿态。

She licked her lips and grinned. 'Yes yes yes yes!' "You said you wanted to be the man who could stand beside me, Third Child. I choose that Shinji too. So I'm going to help push. I'm the Great Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I won't accept anything but the best! So if I want my boyfriend to be a hero…" Asuka surprised him by quickly moving inside his guard as they circled around each other, grabbing his left wrist with her right hand. "He's damn well going to be!" She suddenly yanked on his hand and rolled him around on her hip as she pivoted, throwing him onto the bed. He landed with a thump, blinking in surprise as she followed it up with a leap that landed her astride him.

她舔了舔嘴唇，咧嘴笑道：“是的是的是的！”“你说过你想成为能站在我身边的男人，第三适格者。我也选择了那样的真嗣。所以我要推你一把。我可是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我只接受最好的！所以如果我希望我的男朋友是个英雄……”明日香在他们相互绕圈时迅速切入他的防守，用右手抓住了他的左手腕，让他吃了一惊。“他绝对得是！”她突然猛拉他的手，利用转身的势头将他甩到床上。他砰的一声落在床上，惊讶地眨着眼，而她紧接着一跃而上，跨坐在他身上。

She lightly grabbed the sides of his head and lowered her face to within inches of his, staring hard into his eyes. And for once, he was staring back at her just as hard, his eyes blazing at her like burning pieces of deep ocean. She grinned wider. "And that goes double for my lover, Shin-chan. You think you've got the guts to fight me, you go right ahead and try. By all means, push back. Now shut up and kiss me." She shivered as she felt his hands come up to grip her waist and dig in, almost as much from the fire in his look. 'Oh, it is sonice to finally get to meet you, Shinji Ikari.' Their lips met, and her worries and fears fled for the night.

她轻柔地抓住他的头两侧，将脸贴近至离他仅几寸之遥，目光如炬地凝视着他的双眼。这一次，他也同样坚定地回望着她，眼中闪烁着深海般炽热的火焰。她笑得更开了。“而对于我的爱人，真嗣君，你若自认为有勇气与我一战，那就尽管放马过来。尽你所能，反抗吧。现在，闭嘴，吻我。”当他的手攀上她的腰际，紧紧抓住，几乎与他的目光同样炽热时，她不禁颤抖。哦，终于能与你相遇，真嗣·碇，真是太美妙了。'他们的唇相触，她的忧虑与恐惧在这一夜烟消云散。

Part 51 第 51 章

Judge & Jury 法官与陪审团

Asuka didn't want to get up. She was warm, almost satiated, relaxed, had had nothing but pleasant dreams, and was wrapped around someone who loved her. She was happy. And thanks to the past several years of her life, she had the inescapable feeling that once she opened her eyes, something was going to happen that day that would rob her of just as much happiness as she was now feeling. Since she was feeling fucking great, she knew that meant somehow today would be terrible. She felt the persistent darkness deep inside her welling up again. The universe didn't want her to be happy.

明日香不想起床。她感到温暖，几乎心满意足，放松自在，整夜只有美梦相伴，还被一个深爱她的人拥抱着。她很幸福。然而，由于过去几年的生活经历，她有一种无法摆脱的感觉：一旦睁开眼睛，那天就会发生什么事，夺走她此刻所感受到的同等幸福。既然她现在感觉棒极了，她知道这意味着今天必定会发生糟糕的事。她感到内心深处那股持续的黑暗再次涌起。宇宙似乎并不希望她幸福。

Drowsy anger bubbled up within her in response. 'Well, fuck the universe, then. Especially Wondergirl. I'm going to be happy just to spite her, if nothing else. And if the nights are all like the last two, I think I've got a good base for that.' Last night had been even more fun than the one before; this time they'd both been sober, fully aware of what they were doing from the moment they started, and eager. Even the awkward nervousness Asuka had been half-fearing would come had been washed away at her excitement at finally being face-to-face with the Shinji she'd seen for so long only in a combat situation. He'd met her aggressively, almost angrily. She'd responded just as hard. It had been wonderful. She finished her thought with a nasty grin. 'Hey, if Wondergirl is practically Gott around here now, I wonder if she sawus last night? Ha! I hope she did, and got good and jealous. Up yours, First Child. I hope you were watching, and saw everything you're never going to get. He's mine.' She burrowed her face into his shoulder and smiled to herself. 'Just a few more minutes.'

她心中涌起一股昏昏欲睡的怒气作为回应。好吧，去他的宇宙，尤其是那个神奇女孩。就算只是为了气她，我也要快乐。如果每个夜晚都像前两晚那样，我想我有了一个很好的基础。昨晚比前一晚还要有趣；这次他们都清醒着，从一开始就完全知道自己要做什么，并且充满渴望。就连明日香半是担心会出现的尴尬紧张，也在她终于面对面见到那个长久以来只在战斗场景中见过的真嗣时，被她的兴奋冲刷得一干二净。他以一种近乎愤怒的攻击性迎接她。她同样强硬地回应。那感觉美妙极了。她带着一丝恶意的笑容结束了思绪。嘿，如果神奇女孩现在几乎成了这里的上帝，我倒想知道她昨晚有没有看到我们？哈！我希望她看到了，并且嫉妒得要命。去你的，第一适格者。我希望你当时在看，看到了你永远得不到的一切。他是我的。她把脸埋进他的肩膀，独自微笑。再过几分钟就好。

Moments later, her interface band began to buzz the alarm she'd set. She grimaced. 'No more time for lounging in bed, damn it.' She was already missing Avalon's much longer nights. They'd had to stop themselves enjoying each other for sleep after just three measly hours! She sat up and nudged Shinji, who was already blinking his eyes open. "Come on, Third. Time to be seen, then get on back to saving the world."

片刻后，她的接口带开始嗡嗡作响，提醒她设定的闹钟。她皱了皱眉。'没时间在床上闲躺了，该死。'她已经开始怀念阿瓦隆那更漫长的夜晚。他们不得不在仅仅三个小时后就停止享受彼此，为了睡眠而克制！她坐起身，轻推了推真嗣，他已经开始眨眼醒来。"起来吧，第三适格者。露个面，然后回去继续拯救世界。"

"Why does saving the world always seem to involve me having to get up annoyingly early?" Shinji grumbled. He sat up beside her and swung his legs out of bed. "I can pick up the breakfast trays for both of us if you don't want to have to sit through the meal and go on ahead without me," he said as he reached for a set of pants and a shirt.

"为什么拯救世界总是要我一大早起来，烦死了。" 真嗣嘟囔着。他坐起身，把腿从床上挪下来。"如果你不想坐下来吃早饭，可以先走，我来收拾我们俩的餐盘。" 他说着，伸手去拿裤子和衬衫。

Asuka smothered a unhappy yowl from a part of her she didn't want to look at too closely which didn't like that idea at all, and merely said, "I let you out of my sight and I'm half-certain Wondergirl will try to kidnap you or beam you to the dark side of wherever she's hiding. No way. Let's just go eat in a hurry and get out of here. At this hour there shouldn't be enough people to make it truly irritating." She finished settling her A10 band into her hair. "Then we can get back to our friends and find out what new disaster today probably already has in store for us." 'And you can just chokeon this, First Child. I didn't let dying alone in battle, your Third Impact, or life after the end of the fucking world beat me. I'm not going to lose to you.'

明日香压抑住内心深处不愿深究的那部分所发出的不满低吼，只是说道：“我一旦让你离开视线，就有一半把握那个‘奇迹女孩’会试图绑架你，或是把你传送到她藏身之处的阴暗面。绝无可能。我们还是赶紧去吃点东西，然后离开这里。这个时间应该不会有太多人，不至于让人太烦躁。”她整理好头上的 A10 带。“之后我们再回去找朋友们，看看今天又有什么新灾难在等着我们。”而你，第一适格者，就自食其果吧。无论是孤身战死、你的第三次冲击，还是末日之后的生活，都没能击垮我。我绝不会输给你。

Their awakening and departure from the UN fleet were timed off of the local breakfast time, still matched to an hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, but that translated to an arrival between three and four in the morning at their base in Buenos Aires. Asuka knew Ching would be awake on watch, but she was still a little surprised to find her friend not just awake but waiting for them at the battle table at attention. She even gave Asuka a precise salute as they walked off the transport pad.

他们的苏醒与离开联合国舰队的时间，是按照当地时间早餐时刻安排的，仍比格林尼治标准时间提前一小时，但这意味着他们将在凌晨三到四点抵达布宜诺斯艾利斯的基地。明日香知道青会值夜班醒来，但仍有些惊讶地发现，她的朋友不仅醒着，而且还在战斗桌旁立正等候他们。当他们从运输平台走下时，青甚至向明日香精确地敬了一个礼。

"Good morning, ma'am. I'm afraid we have a situation that falls on you to make the call. You're not just the commander at the moment, you see. As Auxiliary Officers and the top local officials in contact with the Empire, you're also the highest judiciary authority on this planet at this time, as far as Imperial law is concerned. So any judicial questions also fall under your survey."

早上好，女士。恐怕我们遇到了一个需要您做出决定的情况。您现在不仅仅是指挥官，您知道。作为与帝国联系的辅助官员和当地最高官员，就帝国法律而言，您也是这个星球上此刻的最高司法权威。因此，任何司法问题也都在您的管辖之下。

"What are you talking about?" Shinji asked, puzzled.

"你在说什么呢？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

Asuka's mind was already racing ahead. "You've come up with some sort of legal issue since this afternoon? What happened? What kind of situation could you have come up with since we left that demands us to act as judges?"

明日香的思绪早已飞速运转。“你从下午开始就遇到了某种法律问题？发生了什么？自从我们离开后，是什么情况需要我们充当法官的角色？”

Any further questions by the two Pilots were interrupted as a bloodcurdling scream echoed through the hangar from the direction of the Monumental Stadium. Ching just nodded in the direction it had come from. "That situation."

两位飞行员还想继续提问，却被从纪念碑体育场方向传来的凄厉尖叫声打断。青只是朝着声音传来的方向点了点头。“就是那个情况。”

The thrashing body of the large man writhing on the floor of the cage was difficult to identify as the same person as the man who'd rolled up to their base waving a submachine gun and claiming he ruled the city, but the tattoos and scars left little doubt. And they were all too easy to see.

笼中地板上扭动挣扎的魁梧身躯，让人难以辨认出他就是那个曾挥舞着冲锋枪，驱车来到他们基地，宣称自己统治着整座城市的男人，但那些纹身和伤疤却无疑揭示了他的身份。这一切都太过显眼。

"Why is he naked?" Shinji asked. His face was screwed up in a mask of confusion and horror.

"他为什么光着身子？" 真嗣问道，脸上交织着困惑与惊恐的表情。

The former Don Barceló had not stopped screaming, thrashing, and weeping since they'd entered the stadium stands where their growing collection of prisoners were being held. The object of their inspection lay on the floor of a metal cage sitting just in front of the area holding his former soldiers. He was stripped bare, and was covered instead in copious amounts of sweat, vomit, and blood. Asuka steeled herself to look a bit closer in the wan light thrown by the glow of the still spinning holographic sign over their heads.

前唐·巴塞洛自进入关押着越来越多囚犯的体育场看台以来，一直尖叫、挣扎、哭泣不止。他们审视的对象躺在金属笼子的地板上，笼子就位于他昔日士兵所在区域的前方。他全身赤裸，取而代之的是大量汗水、呕吐物和血迹。在头顶旋转的立体全息标志投下的微弱光线下，明日香鼓起勇气，凑近了些仔细观察。

'Yup, he's actually crying blood.' "I'm going to guess he's naked because the way he's carrying on, he's already puked, shit, and pissed all over himself, and it's just easier to hose him off this way?" she asked at Ching, who nodded.

没错，他真的在流血泪。"我猜他现在光着身子，是因为他这样折腾，已经吐了、拉了、尿了自己一身，这样直接用水管冲洗更方便吧？"她向 Ching 问道，后者点了点头。

"But why is he doing this? Why is he screaming?" Shinji asked.

“但他为什么要这么做？为什么要尖叫？” 真嗣问道。

"We let him scream both to drive home the lesson to the others, and because it lets him vent enough of the stress to avoid him going into cardiac arrest too easily," Ching said levelly. "As to why he's doing this? Well, seems he was a very bad man."

"我们让他尖叫，既是为了给其他人一个深刻的教训，也是因为他需要释放足够的压力，以免轻易引发心脏骤停，"青平静地说，"至于他为什么要这么做？看来，他是个非常坏的人。"

Asuka tore her eyes away from the former warlord of the city and stared at her friend. "Explain."

明日香将目光从昔日的城主身上移开，凝视着她的朋友。“解释一下。”

Ching again pulled herself to attention. "Ma'am. Lieutenant Kaji and party reported back from the Casa Rosada about an hour after you'd left. They'd finished taking control of the city apparatus, such as it was, and had started checking out the rest of Don Barceló's headquarters. And they found… his harem and dungeon, I guess you'd call it. Most of the women were in pretty bad shape. The survivors, anyway. Lieutenant Kaji asked for medical assistance as quickly as possible, so Lieutenant Horaki took most of her people from the Medical platoon over there. She came back several hours later and had a long talk with me. She was pretty shaken up by what she'd seen, but you'd be proud of her, she kept it together and did her job. They managed to save most of the ones that were still alive when they got there."

青再次挺直身板，报告道：“长官，您离开大约一小时后，中尉卡吉和队伍从玫瑰宫返回。他们已经控制了城市的行政机构，尽管那并不复杂，并开始检查唐·巴塞洛总部的其他部分。他们发现了……或许可以称之为他的后宫和地牢。大多数女性状况相当糟糕，至少那些幸存者如此。卡吉中尉请求尽快提供医疗援助，因此堀木中尉带领医疗排的大部分人员赶了过去。几小时后她回来，与我进行了长时间的交谈。她对所见情景感到非常震惊，但您会为她感到骄傲，她保持了镇定并完成了任务。他们设法救治了大部分在他们到达时还活着的人。”

Ching's calm report had caused Shinji to slowly turn and rest his horrified gaze on her. "What?"

静的平静报告让真嗣缓缓转过身，惊恐地凝视着她。“什么？”

"He seems to have made quite a hobby of doing absolutely medieval things to women for his entertainment. There was a collection of instruments and devices in his nest that would have done the Spanish Inquisition proud. We recovered six bodies and thirty five survivors from his rooms at the Casa Rosada, along with plenty of evidence that they were far from the first victims. He's been in charge of Buenos Aires for the last three years, and it looks like he started in on this a while back," Ching said, her voice cool and professional, but Asuka could easily hear the undercurrent of razor-edged anger.

他似乎将做些极其中世纪的事情来娱乐自己，尤其是针对女性，变成了一种嗜好。在他的巢穴里，有一批刑具和装置，足以让西班牙宗教裁判所感到自豪。我们在玫瑰宫的房间里找到了六具尸体和三十五名幸存者，还有大量证据表明，他们绝非第一批受害者。过去三年里，他一直掌控着布宜诺斯艾利斯，看起来这种行径早已开始，”青木说道，声音冷静而专业，但明日香轻易就能听出其中潜藏的锋利怒意。

Asuka looked back at the shuddering man in the cage with new disgust. Winthrop had never been nearly that bad, but he hadn't gone out of his way to stop that sort of thing amongst his underlings either. He only intervened in their 'private amusements' if they began to threaten the UN-Warden power structure. And then there was the way he'd treated her for so long, always making it clear he'd have her shot without losing a moment's sleep if he thought she was even possibly a 'problem'. She'd also heard very, very quiet rumors of how things were in the Russian and Chinese Warden's seats of power that sounded like this. She felt no sympathy for Don Barceló. She'd been on the receiving end of people too much like him. "So what is happening to him right now, then?" she asked.

明日香回头厌恶地瞥了一眼笼中颤抖的男子。温斯洛普从未如此恶劣，但他也未曾刻意阻止下属间的此类行径。唯有当这些“私人娱乐”开始威胁到联合国狱长权力结构时，他才会介入。更别提他长期以来对她的态度，总是明确表示，若认为她可能成为“问题”，他会毫不犹豫地命人将她击毙。她还隐约听闻过俄罗斯和中国狱长权力中心那些与此相似的传闻。她对唐·巴塞洛毫无同情，因为她已多次遭遇过类似他这样的人。“那他现在到底遭遇了什么？”她问道。

"Karma," Ching replied, some satisfaction seeping into her tone.

"因果报应，" 青回答道，语气中透出一丝满足。

Asuka raised an eyebrow and gestured for her to go on.

明日香挑了挑眉，示意她继续说下去。

"Standard preliminary punishment under Imperial law in cases like this. Psi platoon put him into a memory fugue state with a little aid from some past-viewing wormholes. He's now reliving every rape, torture, and murder he's ever committed, from the victim's point of view, including sensory feeds. And too bad for him, it looks like there were a lot of them. He's been going steady like this for nine hours now." She pointed to a small blinking module on the other side of his neck from the pacifier. "The pacifier is a redundant safety at this point, and the medical clip there will prevent him from passing out or dehydrating. Wouldn't want him to find any escape by those means from his just desserts."

帝国法律下此类案件的常规预惩措施。心灵战队借助过往窥视虫洞，将他置于记忆混乱状态。如今，他正从受害者的视角，重历每一桩强奸、折磨与谋杀，包括感官反馈。不幸的是，看来他犯下的罪行颇多。他已这样持续了九小时。她指向他颈侧另一边的小型闪烁模块，“此时安抚器已是多余的安全措施，而那医疗夹能防止他昏迷或脱水。我们可不希望他通过这些方式逃避应有的惩罚。”

Shinji's stare drifted mechanically back to Don Barceló. "How… how long will…"

真嗣的目光机械地飘回到唐·巴塞洛身上。“多久……会持续多久……”

Ching shrugged. "Hard to say exactly. He's been ruling this city for most of the time since people started drifting back from the Ring of Souls, and he seems to have indulged his 'habit' more days than he didn't. Several hundred victims, sometimes hours each… he could be like this for several weeks, months probably, if you just let it run."

青耸了耸肩。“很难说具体。自从人们开始从灵魂之环返回以来，他大部分时间都在统治这座城市，而且他似乎沉溺于自己的‘习惯’的日子比不沉溺的日子要多。受害者有好几百，有时每个受害者要花上几个小时……如果你任其发展，他可能会这样持续几周，甚至几个月。”

Asuka nodded in grim satisfaction. 'I almost wish I could bring Winthrop back so I could make him suffer this treatment.' She turned towards Shinji to voice the thought… and stopped.

明日香带着一丝冷酷的满足点了点头。我真希望我能把温思罗普带回来，让他也尝尝这种待遇。' 她转向真嗣，正想说出这个想法……却突然停住了。

Shinji was staring at Don Barceló like a man watching a car crash. "Months?" he asked quietly.

真嗣盯着堂·巴尔塞洛，仿佛目睹了一场车祸。“几个月？”他轻声问道。

Ching nodded again. "Yes, sir. The end of the first run through will probably take at least that long."

青再次点头。“是的，先生。第一次过场结束可能至少需要那么长时间。”

Shinji's eyes widened a little more. "'First run through'? How many times are there going to be?"

真嗣的眼睛睁得更大了。“‘第一次运行’？还会有多少次？”

"Until all the ghosts are satisfied?" Ching shrugged. "That's really up to you two, sir. He could go as long as you want him to. You two are the court here." She paused and pursed her lips slightly. "Well, technically, Lieutenant Sohryu is the commander and has final say, but I strongly recommend as both your executive officer and your friend that you both be in agreement on this, considering how things between you have changed over the last couple of days."

"直到所有鬼魂都满意为止？"青耸了耸肩，"这真的取决于你们两位，先生。他可以按照你们的意愿待多久。你们两位就是这里的法庭。"她停顿了一下，微微抿了抿嘴唇，"嗯，从技术上讲，苏龙中尉是指挥官，拥有最终决定权，但我强烈建议作为你们的执行官和朋友，考虑到最近几天你们之间的关系变化，你们应该在这件事上达成一致。"

'Which means as much as I may be fine with leaving him like this until the sun burns out, Shinji probably won't be quite as open to the idea, so I'll have to throttle it back a bit. But there's only so much I'm willing to give on that, even for him. This man is even worse scum than Winthrop. He just doesn't have access to an N2 mine stockpile, thank Gott. So I'm going to have to push for as much as Shinji will stomach,' Asuka thought. Aloud she said, "I'm not unhappy with leaving him like this for the time being. He's earned every second of this. Let him have a full run through for every woman he did this to and then hang him or something. What do you think, Shinji?"

这意味着，尽管我可能愿意就这样把他留到太阳燃尽，但真嗣可能不会那么容易接受这个想法，所以我得稍微收敛一些。但即便为了他，我能退让的也有限。这家伙比温斯洛普还要卑劣。他只是没有接触到 N2 地雷库存，感谢上帝。因此，我必须争取真嗣能容忍的最大限度，'明日香心想。她大声说道：“我并不介意暂时就这样把他留下。他每一秒都是罪有应得。让他为每一个被他如此对待的女性彻底受一遍，然后再吊死他或怎样。你觉得呢，真嗣？”

Shinji kept staring at him. "I… don't know. I don't like to hurt people, you know that…" He trailed off, sounding uncertain.

真嗣一直盯着他。“我……不知道。我不喜欢伤害别人，你知道的……”他越说声音越小，显得犹豫不决。

Asuka's eyes narrowed. "Shinji, as someone who until a few days ago was convinced she'd been raped hundreds of times for years on end, I am just fine with scum like this suffering every memory of pain he's inflicted on others. He's not getting anything he didn't earn. I am just fine with hurting people like the ones who hurt me. "

明日香的眼睛眯了起来。“真嗣，就在几天前，我还坚信自己多年来被强奸了数百次，对于这种人渣遭受他所施加给他人的每一份痛苦记忆，我完全接受。他没有得到任何不应得的东西。我对于伤害那些曾伤害我的人毫无顾忌。”

Shinji jerked. His right hand stopped its rhythmic clenching and balled into a fist held tremblingly tight. "I… have to go think," he said in a strangled voice.

真嗣猛地一震，他那原本有节奏地握紧的右手突然紧握成颤抖的拳头。“我…得去想想，”他用哽咽的声音说道。

"Fine, we'll go find some place to…"

好吧，我们去找个地方……

"Alone," he said in a harsh, angry voice. Shinji suddenly sprinted off down the stairs away from her and Ching.

"独自一人，"他用严厉而愤怒的声音说道。随即，真嗣突然从她和青身边冲下楼梯，疾驰而去。

Hand half raised, Asuka stood frozen in shock. He was running away. Again. He was running from her… leaving her. 'I… no! NO!' But only a tiny, whispered "Wait…" escaped her lips.

手半举着，明日香僵立在震惊中。他又在逃跑。又一次。他在逃离她……抛下她。我……不！不！然而，只有一声微弱的“等等……”从她唇间逸出。

Ching's hand on her shoulder halted her before she could start running right after him. "Let him go, Asuka," she said gently. "I think he needs to think something over without you seeing him do it."

青的手搭在她的肩上，阻止了她紧随其后的冲动。“让他去吧，明日香，”她温和地说。“我想他需要在没有你看着的情况下思考一些事情。”

"What? Why?" Asuka asked plaintively.

"什么？为什么？" 明日香哀怨地问道。

"One of the same reasons you wanted to be alone after the 15th Angel, I think. No one likes to come to uncomfortable realizations about themselves, and even less so in front of someone they care about. I think something about what you just said struck Shinji pretty hard." She tugged Asuka in the other direction. "Come on. Let's get back to the command pit and get some coffee. I think we should talk too." She spared a last disgusted look at the thrashing prisoner. "And you stop shouting so loud. You're disturbing the commanders."

我想，这和你十五号使徒事件后想要独处的原因之一相同。没人愿意面对自己不愉快的真相，尤其是在关心的人面前更是如此。我觉得你刚才的话对真嗣打击很大。" 她拉着明日香朝另一个方向走去。"走吧，我们回指挥室喝点咖啡，我觉得我们也该谈谈。" 她最后厌恶地瞥了一眼挣扎的囚犯。"还有，你别喊那么大声，你打扰到指挥官们了。"

Asuka ignored him as his cries dropped from shouts and howls to a quieter but more desperate begging for the Mother of God to help him. She fell into step with Ching as she led her away from the cage. His frantic babbling, filled with indescribable pain, followed them down the concrete hall.

明日香对他的哀求置若罔闻，那声音从呼喊和嚎叫逐渐变为更为绝望的低语，恳求圣母玛利亚的援助。她与青一同迈步，远离了牢笼。他那充满难以言喻痛苦的狂乱呓语，随着她们在混凝土走廊中渐行渐远。

Asuka tried likewise to ignore the matching echo that was beginning to rise from her own heart.

明日香同样试图忽视自己心中逐渐升起的共鸣回响。

### Chapter 28 Just Like Him - Family Matters

Shinji was good at running. Except for the last few years in Boston, where he'd been held in place on pain of being shot, he'd been running away his whole life. From the pain of losing his mother, of being abandoned by his father, from his sensei, from the weight of being needed as a Pilot, from the harm he caused others by being a Pilot at all, from facing his feelings for Asuka… He was good at running. It took a lot to make him turn at bay and go roaring back at what he was afraid of, unleashing his seldom roused anger. An anger so violent and unrestrained that he let it loose even less often than his meager pride.

真嗣擅长奔跑。除了在波士顿的最后几年，他因害怕被枪击而被迫停留，他的一生几乎都在逃离。逃离失去母亲的痛苦，逃离被父亲抛弃的孤寂，逃离师父的期望，逃离作为驾驶员的重负，逃离因成为驾驶员而给他人带来的伤害，逃离面对自己对明日香的感情……他擅长奔跑。需要极大的勇气才能让他转身迎战恐惧，释放那罕被激发的愤怒。那愤怒如此猛烈且不受约束，他甚至比展现自己微薄的骄傲还要少地将其释放。

But now that anger was what was fueling this run. Anger, and the realization filling him with such self-disgust that he'd nearly vomited all over his feet.

但现在，正是这股愤怒在推动着他奔跑。愤怒，以及那种让他几乎要吐在自己脚上的自我厌恶感。

'I'm just like him. Just like him.

我和他一样。就像他一样。'

He'd been hesitant. He didn't like causing pain in anyone. That Don Barceló apparently richly deserved it made it more complicated, but it was still hard to watch. He'd been torn on how to treat him…until Asuka spoke. ''Raped hundreds of times for years on end… I am just fine with hurting people like the ones who hurt me'…And so am I. Asuka just wants to hang him? I want him to bleed. I want everyone who hurt her to burn!' There hadn't even been any thought process to it. As soon as she'd said that, the fierce, burning desire to just get in Eva Unit-01, power it up, and use it to crush every person who'd ever hurt Asuka had flashed through him like lightning.

他一直犹豫不决，不愿给任何人带来痛苦。尽管唐·巴塞洛似乎罪有应得，但这让情况更加复杂，看着这一切依旧难以忍受。他纠结于如何对待他……直到明日香开口。“多年来被强奸了数百次……我完全不介意伤害那些伤害过我的人”……我也是。明日香只想吊死他？我想要他流血。我想要所有伤害过她的人都遭受烈焰焚身！”那一刻甚至没有任何思考的过程。她一说完，那种强烈如闪电般划过的欲望就涌上心头，只想进入初号机，启动它，用它来碾碎每一个曾伤害过明日香的人。

'Crush…destroy…kill…all of them. They hurt her. Make them PAY.

摧毁……毁灭……杀戮……所有人。他们伤害了她。让他们付出代价。'

It was really hard to run away when it was your innermost heart that was the cause. He had fallen for her beauty from the moment he'd seen her on the Over The Rainbow's flight deck, and been captured by her vulnerability when he watched her in the moonlight, crying in her sleep for her mother. He loved Asuka. And now she knew it. Confessing at her question had only made the feeling stronger than ever. But he'd failed her so deeply and so badly before that now he'd sworn his life and soul to making that up. All his banked rage and furious anger had finally found a cause that his entire soul could wholeheartedly and joyfully endorse. He'd do anything to protect her and keep her from harm. Anything. There could be no sin in that cause. He'd destroy anyone or anything he had to, to keep the one he loved beyond all others safe.

当内心深处成为逃离的缘由，逃离便变得异常艰难。自他在彩虹之上飞行甲板初见她，便沉醉于她的美貌；而当他目睹月光下她梦中为母亲哭泣的脆弱时，更是被深深俘获。他爱着明日香，如今她已知晓。在她的追问下坦白，让这份情感愈发强烈。然而，他曾深深地辜负过她，如今他誓言倾尽生命与灵魂去弥补。所有积压的愤怒与狂怒终于找到了一个全心全意、乐意为之奋斗的目标。他愿做任何事来守护她，免她受伤害，无论何事。为此目的，绝无罪孽可言。为了保护那个他深爱至极的人，他愿意摧毁任何必须摧毁的人或物。

Just like his father. 就像他父亲一样。

'I don't want to be like him! No no no no no no no!' Gendo Ikari was a monster. No one but his mother had even pretended he was, could be, or had ever been anything but. And apparently no one besides her had ever loved him, either. 'And now I've got inarguable evidence that I'm exactly like him. I'd call down the Third Impact again if it meant saving her. How the Hell could I ever hope for her to love someone like that? How can I pretend to be worthy of her when I could turn into a red-handed berserker at any moment?' He was having a very hard time keeping the thought from his head of asking Daniel and Rayana if he could somehow get his hands personally on Winthrop and Jinnai and make them go through the same thing Don Barceló was suffering right now, or more. He was having an even harder time not savoring the idea.

我不想成为他那样的人！不不不不不不不！'源堂元是一个怪物。除了他的母亲，没有人假装他是，能是，或曾经是任何别的东西。显然，除了她，也没有人爱过他。而现在，我有无可辩驳的证据证明我跟他一模一样。如果这意味着能救她，我宁愿再次引发第三次冲击。我怎么可能指望她会爱上这样的人？我怎能假装自己配得上她，当我在任何时刻都可能变成一个血手狂徒？'他极力阻止自己去想是否可以请求丹尼尔和雷亚娜，让他亲自对温索普和神谷下手，让他们经历与唐·巴塞洛现在所受相同的，甚至更甚的痛苦。他更难以抗拒不去品味这个念头。

He stumbled his way out of the stands and down onto the field. 'I think I might even be starting to understand my father now. Oh Gods. The last thing Asuka needs is yet another evil bastard in her life. She'd be better off without me. Everyone would. All I do is hurt people. Touji and his sister, Kaworu, Asuka, everyone in the world….I should just end it all, and leave forever.' It had been a while since the cold kiss of a gun barrel against his head had felt attractive. There had been some dark points of despair at times in Boston, especially early on, right after Asuka…left. It couldn't be that hard to find one here, amongst so many soldiers…

他跌跌撞撞地从看台走出，下到球场。我想我可能开始理解我的父亲了。哦，天啊。明日香最不需要的就是生活中再多一个恶毒的混蛋。没有我，她会更好。所有人都会。我所做的只是伤害别人。东治和他的妹妹，薰，明日香，全世界的每个人……我应该结束这一切，永远离开。' 自从枪管冰冷的触感贴在头上变得诱人以来，已经有一段时间了。在波士顿，尤其是在明日香离开后不久的早期，有时会有绝望的黑暗时刻。在这里，在这么多士兵中，找到一把枪应该不会太难……

His headlong run was finally slowing from exhaustion and nerves, leaving him midfield between the looming masses of Rote Wirbelsturm and Eva Unit-01. 'Just…like…HIM. Oh Gods, I don't want to be him!' His stomach finally rebelled. He doubled over and began to vomit up the meager shipboard breakfast.

他那不顾一切的奔跑终于因疲惫和紧张而放缓，使他处于红色旋风和伊娃零号机庞大身躯之间的中场位置。就像……他一样。哦，天啊，我不想成为他！他的胃终于反抗了。他弯下腰，开始呕吐出那点可怜的船上早餐。

"I know how you feel, sir. If I wasn't keeping my stomach in line by will, I'd be right there next to you. I have never had a headache this bad," Lieutenant O'Brien said from his seat on a box just to Shinji's left.

"我理解您的感受，先生。如果不是靠意志力控制着胃，我也会和您一样。我从没经历过这么严重的头痛，" 奥布赖恩中尉坐在信二左边的一个箱子上说道。

Shinji's head was killing him, but how the Hell would Lieutenant O'Brien know about why and feel the same? A few more bile-filled heaves and his head came up. He stared at the Lieutenant with a puzzled look as the heaves subsided. "What?" he hesitantly mumbled, wiping at his mouth with his sleeve.

真嗣的头痛得要命，但奥布赖恩中尉怎么会知道原因，又怎能感同身受呢？再几次充满胆汁的干呕后，他抬起头来。随着干呕平息，他困惑地盯着中尉。“什么？”他迟疑地嘟囔着，用袖子擦了擦嘴。

"I've got the world's worst killer super-migraine headache from that separation effect Miss Ayanami slammed us with. Isn't that's what's hitting you?" The young princeling eyed him sympathetically. "I wish I had some painkillers to offer, but I wasn't expecting company." He pinched his eyes shut and massaged his temples. "Man, I have never had a headache like this before. But then, I've never been cut off from home like this before either."

我被绫波小姐那招分离效应搞得头痛欲裂，简直是世界级的超级偏头痛。你不是也中招了吗？"年轻的王子同情地看着他，"真希望能给你点止痛药，但我没想到会有客人来。"他紧闭双眼，揉着太阳穴，"天哪，我从没经历过这么严重的头痛。不过，我也从未像这样与家隔绝过。"

Shinji was shakily grateful for the chance to pull his mind onto a different topic. "This doesn't happen often?"

真嗣对于有机会将思绪转移到其他话题上感到颤抖的感激。“这种情况不常发生吗？”

"Nope. I think I can count the number of actual Code Dragonflies I've heard of on my fingers. We tend to take a lot of measures to prevent this sort of thing from happening. We instituted a lot of them after the first one."

没有。我想我能用手指头数出我听说过的真正的代码蜻蜓的数量。我们倾向于采取很多措施来防止这种事情发生。在第一次事件后，我们实施了很多这样的措施。

"What was the 'first one'? Was that the CGS Ibthan's Dragonfly Daniel, I mean, your great grandfather mentioned?" Shinji asked, wanting his mind diverted by something, anything else. But Lieutenant O'Brien shook his head.

"那个'第一个'是什么？是指 CGS 伊布坦的蜻蜓丹尼尔吗，我是说，你曾祖父提到的那位？" 真嗣问道，希望自己的思绪能被其他任何事情所转移。但奥布赖恩中尉摇了摇头。

"Sergeant Bir said he wanted to tell all of you NERV folks that story at once, later today. Said it might give you some hope."

比尔中士说他想在今天晚些时候，立刻向你们 NERV 的所有人讲述那个故事。他说这或许能给你们带来一些希望。

"So there was a happy ending at least?"

所以至少有一个幸福的结局吗？

The Imperial tilted his head and twisted his mouth a bit. "Weeeelll….mostly? They kept that Earth from getting completely destroyed, and a bit more than half of the crews were still alive when the rescue fleet arrived. Took some casualties doing it, though. It still doesn't happen a lot, fortunately." He snorted. "Figures. First time I'm on an assignment out of the Empire, and I get caught in an 'interesting adventure'."

皇帝侧了侧头，嘴角微挑：“嗯……算是吧。他们保住了那颗地球免于彻底毁灭，救援舰队抵达时，还有超过半数的船员幸存。不过，为此也付出了一些伤亡。所幸，这种情况并不常见。”他轻哼一声，“不出所料。我第一次出帝国执行任务，就卷入了这场‘惊险冒险’。”

Shinji looked at him oddly. "First time? You've never done this before? How old are you?"

真嗣奇怪地看着他。“第一次？你以前从没做过这个？你多大了？”

"Um, I'm nineteen, sir. Why?"

"嗯，我十九岁，先生。为什么问这个？"

"Because the last time I asked how old one of you people were, I got told it was something above 400,000 years. It's kind of thrown my scale off."

因为上次我问你们中某一位的年龄时，被告知是超过 40 万年。这让我对时间的衡量标准都乱了套。

"Sorry to throw it back on, I guess? I'm just nineteen standard years old, sir. I've only been a Lieutenant for four months. You're older than I am, I think."

"抱歉，我这就接上话，我想？我刚满十九标准岁，先生。当上中尉才四个月。您应该比我年长，我想。"

He shook his head and looked more carefully at Shinji. "But you didn't come running down here because of a headache, did you, sir? You've got something much more painful written all over your face. Anything I can do to help?"

他摇了摇头，更加仔细地打量着真嗣。“但您并不是因为头痛才跑下来的，对吧，先生？您的脸上写满了更深的痛苦。有什么我能帮忙的吗？”

"….Did you know you father well?"

"……你和你父亲熟吗？"

"Um, yeah, he raised me, right there with mom. I talked to him yesterday. Why?"

嗯，是的，他把我养大的，就和妈妈一起。我昨天还和他聊过。怎么了？

"Did you ever worry about turning into him?"

"你有没有担心过自己会变成他那样？"

"Worry? No, my father's a really decent guy. He taught me a lot about how to face the world. And it's a pretty common saying in the Empire that 'a lot of men grow up to become their fathers'. I'm guessing your dad wasn't the sort of man you'd want to end up like?"

担心？不，我父亲是个非常正派的人。他教会了我许多面对世界的方法。帝国里有句俗话，“很多男人长大后都变成了他们的父亲”。我猜你父亲不是那种你想成为的人吧？

Shinji managed a single, bitter laugh. "No. He's not. He's one of the greatest murderers and deceitful bastards this planet has ever seen. But I just realized I'm much more like him than I ever wanted to contemplate." He waved his hand towards Unit-01. "When I was not yet four years old, I watched my mother be absorbed, body and soul, into that mecha. She knew it was going to happen and did it anyhow. My father went crazy, dumped me off without any explanation to live with a tutor, and spent the next ten years away from me plotting to end the world and erase humanity as individuals so he could have the chance to get back to her side. He lied to, plotted against, blackmailed, and murdered anyone he had to, to make that happen." Shinji took a deep breath. "And I just realized I wouldn't hesitate one second to do all that and more to protect Asuka. I already nearly ended life on this world as we know it when I thought she rejected me after I begged her for help when I really needed her, and was going to leave me alone for the rest of our lives."

真嗣勉强挤出一丝苦笑：“不，他不是。他是这个星球上最伟大的杀手和最狡诈的混蛋之一。但我刚刚意识到，我其实和他很像，远超我所愿去深思。”他挥手示意着零号机，“我不到四岁时，亲眼看着母亲被那台机甲吞噬，肉体与灵魂皆不剩。她明知会发生什么，却还是选择了这条路。父亲因此疯了，将我毫无解释地丢给一个家庭教师，之后的十年里，他远离我，策划着毁灭世界，抹去人类个体，只为有机会回到她身边。为了达到目的，他欺骗、算计、勒索、杀害，无所不用其极。”真嗣深吸一口气，“而我刚刚意识到，为了保护明日香，我也会毫不犹豫地做出同样甚至更甚的事情。当我以为她在我最需要帮助时拒绝了我，并打算余生都让我孤独一人时，我差点就毁灭了我们熟知的世界。”

"….ok, I missed the mission brief on the situation here, so you're going to explain just whiskey tango foxtrot you're talking about, sir."

……好吧，我错过了这里的任务简报，所以请你解释一下，你到底在说什么，长官。

Shinji took another deep breath and started to explain the Second Impact and subsequent events to the first person he'd ever met who didn't know what that was. His abysmal mood lifted a little, albeit with black amusement, as he watched Lieutenant O'Brien's expression go from shock at the Second Impact's three billion dead, to sick fascination as he described the endless parade of horrors that was the Angel War, to pained sadness at the brutal, anarchy-and-warlords mess of the last few years after the Third Impact, and then to sympathy and admiration for his description of the week of the coup against Winthrop. Finally, when Shinji tried to describe the kaleidoscopic strangeness that was his experience at the heart of Instrumentality, Lieutenant O'Brien's expression was a study in confusion and sympathy.

真嗣深吸一口气，开始向他所遇见的第一个对此一无所知的人解释第二次冲击及其后续事件。他那阴郁的心情略微好转，带着一丝黑色幽默，观察着奥布赖恩中尉的表情变化：从震惊于第二次冲击导致的三亿死亡，到对天使战争中无尽恐怖景象的病态好奇，再到对第三次冲击后几年间残酷无序、军阀混战的痛苦哀伤，直至对他描述政变周对抗温索普时的同情与钦佩。最后，当真嗣试图描绘他在人类补完计划核心所经历的千变万化的奇异景象时，奥布赖恩中尉的表情充满了困惑与同情。

"Lord's balls, sir! This world is seriously frakked up. I'm amazed you're all as well as you are after all that. No wonder we were about to drop an entire light division on this place. You guys really need the help!"

"天哪，先生！这个世界真是乱七八糟。经历了那么多，你们还能保持这样，我真是惊讶。难怪我们差点要派一个轻装师来这里。你们确实需要帮助！"

'And my father and I were right in the middle of the mess, helping it end up this way. Have I ever made anything better?' Shinji's mood darkened again. He studied his still shaking hands. "She's had enough of evil men wrecking her life. She doesn't need another one. Maybe she'd be better off without me."

我和父亲正处在混乱的中心，促成了这样的结局。我可曾让事情变得更好过？' 真嗣的心情再次阴沉下来。他注视着自己仍在颤抖的双手。"她已经受够了恶人毁掉她的生活。她不需要再有一个。或许没有我，她会更好。"

"That's a pretty harsh and final way to try and avoid the problem, sir. How long have you been together?"

先生，那是一种相当严苛且决绝的方式来试图逃避问题。你们在一起多久了？

"Um… We've known each other for over five years, lived together for a bit, fought together, but we were separated shortly after the Third Impact for years. We only really got together, I mean I told her I love her just… two days ago? Avalon days, so nearly three or four Earth days, I think." Shinji shook his head in disbelief. Had his life really turned upside down in just that little time?

“呃……我们认识已经超过五年了，一起生活过一段时间，共同战斗过，但在第三次冲击后不久就被迫分离，多年未见。直到……两天前？阿瓦隆的日子，差不多相当于地球上的三四天吧，我才真正向她表白，说我爱她。” 真嗣难以置信地摇了摇头。难道他的生活真的就在这么短的时间内彻底翻转了吗？

"Seriously? You two sure don't look like three T-days. Or even five years. You looked like you've been linked for a lifetime. You two frakking glow when you look at each other, sir. It's a pretty cool thing to see from our point of view. A beauty beyond the visible." He gave Shinji a cockeyed look. "And I got to say, thinking about telling her 'you'd be better off without me' three days after telling her you love her is kind of a dumb move. So now you're feeling tons of self-loathing because you're worried you might be more like your dad than you ever thought, and you're feeling guilty over how you nearly destroyed the world when you got handed the powers of a god at the worst moment of your life?"

真的假的？你们俩怎么看都不像才过了三个 T 日，甚至不止五年。你们看起来就像已经相伴了一生。你们互望时那种光芒四射的样子，长官，从我们的角度看，真是美得不可方物。他斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼，“而且我得说，三天前才向她表白，现在又想着告诉她‘没有我你会更好’，这招可真够蠢的。所以你现在满心自责，担心自己可能比你想象的更像你父亲，还因为差点在人生最糟糕的时刻，被赋予神一般的力量而毁灭世界而感到内疚？”

Shinji just nodded. Asuka was right. This world hated them. He'd been so happy this morning…

真嗣只是点了点头。明日香说得对。这个世界憎恨着他们。他今早还那么开心……

"Honestly, I'm… actually pretty impressed , sir."

老实说，我……其实挺佩服您的，先生。

Shinji raised his head to see if he was being mocked. 'He can't be serious.'

真嗣抬起头，想看看自己是否遭到了嘲笑。他不可能当真。

"You'd just lost everything, failed to save the girl you love, watched the enemy chewing on her, then got your heart smashed flat when you tried once last time to reach out to her….and you still chose to reach for hope? And then you were ready even after four years of life in the most brutal world I've ever run into to try again and risk it all for her? Sir, I'm a Prince Of The Blood of Avalon. I know I could do something like that, because I've got the whole Empire at my back and the power of gods in my blood. But I'd still have to steel myself. You did it despite emotional and spiritual terrors that should have crippled most men! I'm damn near in awe, sir."

你刚失去了一切，未能救出心爱的女孩，眼睁睁看着敌人吞噬她，最后一次试图触及她时，心被彻底击碎……即便如此，你仍选择伸手去抓取希望？然后，在经历了我所遇过的最残酷世界中四年的生活后，你依然准备再次尝试，为她冒一切风险？先生，我是阿瓦隆的皇族血脉之子。我知道我能做到那样的事，因为我背后有整个帝国，血液中流淌着神的力量。但我仍需坚定意志。而你，在那些足以令多数人崩溃的情感与精神恐怖面前，却做到了！先生，我几乎对你肃然起敬。

Shinji blinked at him. 'He can't be serious.' "Didn't you hear me? I said the whole world could just go die when Rei asked me what I wanted! I nearly sent the whole world to oblivion because I couldn't stand the pain!"

真嗣眨了眨眼，看着他。他不可能当真吧。' 你没听见我说的吗？当绫波问我想要什么时，我说全世界都可以去死了！我差点因为无法忍受痛苦而让整个世界化为乌有！

"But you didn't. You pulled back and chose hope instead, even in the depths of all that should have broken you. You had every reason to just fold up and consign everything to nothingness…but you didn't. I can do something like that because I know at the ultimate end, the Lord and Lady are watching, and 'no sparrow shall fall, that they do not save it.' You did it with nothing but hope that the world could get better and your own heart. That's frankly amazing, sir."

但你没有。你选择了退后一步，选择了希望，即便在那些足以摧毁你的深渊之中。你有无数理由就此屈服，将一切归于虚无……但你没有。我能做到这一点，是因为我知道在最终的尽头，主与女神在注视着，“没有一只麻雀坠落，是他们不去拯救的。”你仅凭着世界会变好的希望和自己的心做到了这一切。坦白说，先生，这真是令人惊叹。

'Asuka was right again. These people arenuts.'

明日香又对了。这些人真是疯了。

"And being ready to do anything you must to protect the one you love? That doesn't make you a bad person, sir, it makes you a man in love. You asked if I know my dad? He's a Ranger First Class, but he's the quiet, subtle, diplomacy and talk-things-out sort, not the fire-and-storm kind. But he's very devoted to mom. He told me once he'd leave the Empire behind and smash open the gates of Hell alone to rescue her if he had to. Though he admitted in the next breath in such a case he'd probably meet her coming out the gates after she finished kicking her way out, since mom was also a Ranger on top of being a Princess Of The Blood and perfectly capable of taking care of herself." He laughed to himself for a second. "Then there's what mom had to say on the topic: 'Let man fear woman when she loves for when she loves she makes every sacrifice and all else becomes meaningless. Let man fear woman when she hates because man in his innermost soul is merely evil, woman, however, is mean.'"

为了保护所爱之人，不惜一切代价，这并不会让你成为坏人，先生，这只会让你成为一个深陷爱河的男人。你问我是否了解我父亲？他是陆军游骑兵一等兵，但他是个沉默寡言、善于外交、喜欢通过对话解决问题的人，而非那种雷厉风行之辈。但他对母亲极为忠诚。他曾告诉我，如果有必要，他会抛弃帝国，独自砸开地狱之门去救她。尽管他紧接着承认，在那种情况下，他很可能会遇到母亲自己从门里出来，因为她已经踹开门出来了，毕竟母亲不仅是皇室血统的公主，还是一名游骑兵，完全有能力自保。"他自顾自地笑了笑。"至于母亲对此事的看法则是：'当女人爱时，男人应感到畏惧，因为那时她会做出一切牺牲，其他一切变得无足轻重。当女人恨时，男人也应感到畏惧，因为在男人内心深处只是邪恶，而女人则是刻薄。'"

"Nietzsche," Shinji recognized. His survey of the German philosopher's material may have been less deep than it could have been, but he remembered running across that line.

"尼采，" 真嗣辨认出来了。他对这位德国哲学家的研究或许不如预期深入，但他记得曾偶然读到过那句话。

Lieutenant O'Brien nodded. "And mom always said if anything ever happened to dad she'd go full 'wrath of grandma' mode and unload as much holy wrath as her bloodline allowed on the cause. And being a 'Bloody Princess', as she always put it, meant she really could bring down Armageddon if she felt it needful. My parents aren't bad people because they're willing to go to extremes for each other. They're just really in love. I mean, look at it this way, sir; you wouldn't just unload violence on some random innocent, would you? Or for personal gain, or just because you felt like it?"

奥布赖恩中尉点了点头。“而我妈总是说，如果爸爸出了什么事，她会彻底进入‘奶奶的愤怒’模式，倾泻出她血脉所允许的全部神圣怒火于肇事者。自称‘血腥公主’的她，确实有能力在必要时引发末日。我的父母并非恶人，他们只是为了彼此愿意走向极端。他们真的深爱着对方。我的意思是，长官，您不会无缘无故对某个无辜者施暴吧？或者为了个人利益，或者仅仅因为一时兴起？”

Shinji searched inside himself for a moment to be sure, before saying with relief, "No, no I wouldn't. But…for her…" 'I'd do anything.'

碇真嗣在内心深处探寻了片刻，确认后才如释重负地说：“不，我不会。但是……为了她……”我愿意做任何事。

"So you still know the difference, and your moral compass hasn't been thrown out. It just has a new pole."

看来你仍能分辨是非，你的道德指南针并未丢失，只是有了新的指向。

"That's still just like my father," Shinji replied listlessly. "He only cared about getting my mother back. Nothing else mattered, not even me."

"那还是像我父亲的做法，" 真嗣无精打采地回答，"他只在乎把我母亲找回来。其他什么都不重要，连我也不例外。"

"Well, I can think of a couple of things that will ease your worries, sir."

嗯，我能想到几件事可以缓解您的忧虑，先生。

Shinji shrugged his shoulders a bit. "Go ahead, maybe it will help. And could you stop calling me 'sir'? I'm only a year older than you, and I've been a Lieutenant about a day and a half."

真嗣微微耸了耸肩。“说吧，或许会有帮助。还有，你能别叫我‘先生’吗？我只比你大一岁，而且我当上中尉才一天半。”

The young Imperial grinned. "Well, the rules are specifically loosened under a Code Dragonfly, si….er, Shinji?" Shinji nodded his permission. "I mean, we have no idea how long we'll be isolated, so the degree of military spit and polish discipline required in the unit is really up to the commander, which happily is you and Lieutenant Sohryu. So if you want to be more informal, you can just order such. In which case…" He stuck out his hand to Shinji. "Hi, I'm Thaddeus Jayne Ramius O'Brien, Prince Of The Blood. My friends call me TJ."

年轻的帝国成员咧嘴一笑：“嗯，在龙蜻蜓指令下，规则确实有所放宽，对吧……呃，真嗣？”真嗣点头表示同意。“我是说，我们不知道会被隔离多久，所以部队所需的严格军事纪律程度，实际上取决于指挥官，而幸运的是，就是你和苏赫尔尤中尉。所以，如果你想更随意一些，只需下令即可。那么……”他向真嗣伸出手，“嗨，我是萨德乌斯·杰恩·拉米乌斯·奥布赖恩，皇室血脉的王子。朋友们都叫我 TJ。”

Shinji took his hand and gently shook it. "'Let's be good friends'?" he said, wistfully remembering another meeting.

真嗣握住他的手，轻轻摇了摇。“‘让我们成为好朋友’？”他若有所思地回忆起另一次相遇。

TJ looked puzzled. "Um, sure?"

TJ 显得困惑。“呃，当然？”

Shinji gave him a weak smile. "Something Asuka said a long time ago when she first met Rei. It didn't go as well as it might."

真嗣对他露出了一个无力的微笑。“这是很久以前，明日香第一次见到绫波时说的话。结果并不如人意。”

"Eh, I'm sure we can get along. Anyway, one of the things that I bet will help is her. I mean, you trust her, right?"

"哎，我相信我们能相处得来。不管怎样，我敢打赌，有她在肯定能帮上忙。我是说，你信任她，对吧？"

Shinji nodded. "Yes. More than anyone, I think. We know each other too well and have already done our worst to each other. And I feel-" 'Alive. Happy. Buzzing. Like I'm on fire in a good way.' "…so much better with her."

真嗣点头道：“是的，我想比任何人都更甚。我们彼此太过了解，已经对对方做过最糟的事。而我感觉——”活着。快乐。兴奋不已。就像以一种美好的方式燃烧着。”“……和她在一起，感觉好多了。”

"So trust her. If you think you're about to do something truly nasty, run it past her. Is she likely to approve something too evil?"

那就相信她吧。如果你觉得自己即将做出什么极不道德的事，先和她商量一下。她会同意过于邪恶的事情吗？

"Er…." “呃…”

"Um… ok. Well, there's also us. We won't let you go too evil. If it's something bad, we'll stop you. If it's something righteous, we'll probably help you. You can count on us to keep you from going Darkside, don't worry. And you trust your friends, the other NERV folks, right? I bet they won't let you go bad if you talk to them."

嗯…好吧。还有我们呢。我们不会让你变得太邪恶的。如果是坏事，我们会阻止你。如果是正义之事，我们或许会帮你。放心，有我们在，你不会堕入黑暗面的。而且你信任你的朋友们，NERV 的同事们，对吧？我敢打赌，如果你和他们谈谈，他们也不会让你变坏的。

"If I can. I've never been the best guy for communicating. And there's things about the last four years I don't want to ever lay on anyone else." Shinji suppressed a shiver at some of the memories that tried to rise up.

如果我能的话。我从来不是沟通的高手。而且关于过去四年的某些事情，我不想让任何人承担。" 真嗣压抑着因某些试图浮现的记忆而产生的颤抖。

"Fair enough. Just remember you're never alone, dude. That's not just the Army motto. We mean it. We all watch out for each other. We'll keep you from turning too much into your dad, I promise. At the least, we'll give you an outside set of eyes and tell you when you're running off course. And I feel safe in betting Lieutenant Sohryu will do the same even more so."

说得有理。但要记住，你永远不会孤单，兄弟。这不只是军队的口号。我们是认真的。我们互相照应。我保证，我们会防止你变得太像你父亲。至少，我们会给你提供外部的视角，告诉你何时偏离了轨道。而且我敢打赌，早乙女少尉会更加如此。

Shinji snorted softly. "Yeah, Asuka's never exactly been restrained in telling me what she thinks of me. I'm hoping it will be a little different from now on, though. It used to be mostly questioning my intelligence or manhood."

真嗣轻声哼了一下。“是啊，明日香向来直言不讳地告诉我她对我的看法。不过，我希望从今往后能有所不同。以前她大多是在质疑我的智商或男子气概。”

"Really? You must have had a really good last few days. You two look amazing together. Oh yeah, almost forgot the biggest thing that will stop you from being your dad; awareness. Do you want to be your dad?"

真的吗？你们最近几天一定过得很不错。你们俩看起来真是天造地设。哦对了，差点忘了最重要的一点，它能阻止你变成你父亲那样；那就是意识。你想成为你父亲那样的人吗？

"No!" Shinji hunched his shoulders in horror. 'I'd rather be back to lonely exile in Boston, Asuka lost to me again, than turn into my father. I'd hurt her less.'

"不！" 真嗣惊恐地缩起肩膀。我宁愿回到波士顿孤独的流放，明日香再次输给我，也不愿变成我父亲那样。那样我伤害她会少一些。

"Well, there you go. You're aware of yourself, aware of who your father was, and you know you don't want to be him. So don't. We are who we decide we want to be, after all…So if you've already decided you don't want to be him, just decide who you do want to be."

好了，你已经明白了。你意识到自己的存在，知道你父亲是谁，也清楚你不想成为他那样的人。那就别成为他。毕竟，我们最终成为什么样的人，是由我们自己决定的……既然你已经决定不想成为他，那就决定你想成为什么样的人吧。

"'Who am I?'" Shinji said, half to himself. "Seems to be the question everyone wants me to answer lately. I'm still half-afraid to even check to closely if I'm still the same person I think I remember being from before the Third Impact put all of our souls in one big mixing pot. I really wish I knew who I am."

"'我是谁？' 真嗣自言自语道。'最近似乎每个人都想让我回答这个问题。我甚至害怕仔细审视自己，是否还是我记忆中的那个人，自从第三次冲击将所有灵魂投入一个大熔炉之后。我真的希望我知道自己是谁。"

Part 53 第 53 章

Family Matters 家庭事务

"Heh. Me too." “嘿，我也是。”

Shinji raised his head again to give TJ a funny look. "You didn't have to go through anything like Instrumentality, did you? And I thought you got along with your parents?"

真嗣再次抬头，用一种滑稽的眼神看着 TJ。“你并没有经历过像人类补完计划那样的事情，对吧？我以为你和你的父母相处得很好呢？”

"Eh… my problem's kind of the opposite extreme of yours. Yeah, I got on fine with my folks. And my extended family. But they're also the problem; Mom and Dad are both Rangers First Class, Mom's a Princess Of The Blood, a granddaughter of the Lord and Lady, my aunts, uncles, sibs, et cetera are all major heroes, warriors, scientists, healers… frakking legends, some of them. Me? I'm the nineteen year old with no direction and a titanic family legacy to live up to. I've got the entire omniverse open to me, incredible powers at my command… and I have no idea what I want. The paralysis of total freedom…"

呃……我的问题和你的正好相反。是啊，我和父母相处得很好，还有我的大家庭。但问题也出在他们身上；爸妈都是一级游侠，妈妈是皇族血统的公主，祖父母辈的贵族后裔，我的姑姑、叔叔、兄弟姐妹等等，都是大英雄、战士、科学家、治疗师……有些甚至是传奇人物。而我呢？一个十九岁，毫无目标，却背负着家族巨大遗产的年轻人。我面前是整个多元宇宙，拥有惊人的力量……可我根本不知道自己想要什么。这种完全自由带来的瘫痪感……

TJ sighed and sat back against the stack of crates behind the one he was sitting on. "We're totally cut off from home and support, so I suppose I should be scared or worried or something, but I've been trained so much that I'm not. I just don't know where I want to go. I've got all these powers, but no certainty of my heading. And because of those powers I'm probably going to have a Hell of a lot of responsibilities fall on my head because I'm the only one who can do them. So I kind of know what you mean about having all that power in your hands and not being sure about handling it. And like you, I'm not at all sure I'm who I need to be to be ready for that."

TJ 叹了口气，向后靠在身后的一堆板条箱上。“我们完全与家和支持隔绝了，所以我应该感到害怕或担忧之类的，但我受过太多训练，以至于我并不害怕。我只是不知道我想去哪里。我拥有这些超能力，却没有明确的方向。而且，因为这些能力，我可能将要承担一大堆只有我能完成的职责。所以我有点理解你说的，手握如此力量却对如何驾驭它感到不确定。就像你一样，我完全不确定自己是否已经准备好迎接这一切。”

Shinji tried to figure out what he meant, but gave up after a minute. "What are you talking about? What responsibilities? I thought Asuka and I are the ones who are stuck with being the judges for these," he waved at the crowd of militiamen in the upper stands, "these men, prisoners, thugs, whatever."

真嗣试图理解他的意思，但一分钟后就放弃了。“你在说什么？什么责任？我以为我和明日香才是被迫担任这些人的评委，”他朝着看台上那群民兵挥了挥手，“这些人，囚犯，恶棍，随便怎么称呼。”

TJ shook his head. "No, that's still your burden to carry, man. I'm talking about later on, if we start running into things that cause casualties, or such. We've got no chaplain or other clerics with us. Thanks to my bloodline, I'm the only one here who can even try to do any soul work. But I've had no training, I just know that I have that ability. I really, really hope that when the time comes, I don't screw it up."

TJ 摇了摇头：“不，那仍是你的负担，兄弟。我说的是以后，如果我们开始遭遇导致伤亡的情况，或者类似的事情。我们这里没有牧师或其他神职人员。多亏了我的血统，我是唯一一个能尝试做灵魂工作的人。但我没有受过训练，我只知道自己有这种能力。真的，真的希望到时我不会搞砸。”

"'Soul work'?" Shinji turned that over in his head for a bit. He knew thanks to the Third Impact that souls were very real, and not necessarily tied to a physical form. But the only entity he'd ever seen manipulating souls directly had been Rei at the height of that strange period, and he hadn't been in the best shape mentally to really watch what she'd been doing. He supposed that his father and NERV had to have been doing something with souls to do what they'd done with the Evangelions and the souls they'd placed in their Cores to make them work, but what did that mean here? "You mean… you can… do something with souls? Like if we have to try getting Eva Unit-01 active again?"

"灵魂工作？" 真嗣在脑海中反复琢磨这个词。他知道，由于第三次冲击，灵魂是真实存在的，并不一定与肉体相连。但他唯一见过的直接操纵灵魂的实体是那个奇怪时期巅峰状态的零，而那时他的精神状态并不适合真正观察她在做什么。他猜想，他的父亲和 NERV 肯定在灵魂方面做了些什么，才能让那些被植入核心的灵魂驱动使徒，但在这里这意味着什么呢？"你的意思是……你能……对灵魂做些什么？比如如果我们需要尝试重新激活初号机？"

TJ nodded. "Yeah, that kind of thing. If anyone gets a lethal hit, I'm the only one who might be able to catch them and hold them before they fall into the Ring," he pointed skyward, "if we're lucky, or truly dissipate if we're not. Putting a soul into Unit-01's core? I think I could do that, maybe. I don't know who would be crazy enough to be the subject for that. I mean, that requires the complete absorption of the physical form, right?"

TJ 点了点头。“对，就是那种情况。如果有人遭受致命一击，我是唯一可能在他们坠入环带之前抓住并稳住他们的人，”他指向天空，“如果我们幸运的话，或者彻底消散，如果我们不走运。将灵魂注入零号机的核心？我想我或许能做到。不知道谁会疯狂到愿意成为那个实验对象。我的意思是，那需要完全吸收肉体，对吧？”

Shinji nodded with a grimace, uncomfortable memories of his month spent absorbed into Unit-01's core himself surfacing. "Um, yeah, I think so. And then the Pilot has to have enough of a connection with the soul in the Core to synch with it. How did you know that?"

真嗣皱着眉点了点头，一个月前自己被吸入零号机核心的不适记忆涌上心头。“嗯，我想是的。而且驾驶员必须与核心中的灵魂有足够的联系才能同步。你怎么知道的？”

TJ shrugged. "Lieutenant Leibshott assigned me command of the Support platoon, which means hooking it up to the city grid for power generation is my job. So I've been looking at its systems all day since you brought it in and I've gotten to know a little about it. Lieutenant Katsuragi helped out where she could, telling me what she knew, and there's this one new Private in my platoon who really seems to grasp how the thing works, so we've been getting it done faster than I thought we might. I'm stunned it has as much soul technology as it does considering the pretty low conventional tech base and practically non-existent spiritual tech base you guys had here. But if you made it work before, we might be able to do something with it. We'd really have to be in deep shit before we'd try it, though. We'd practically have to do a human sacrifice to make it move, and boy do I not want to ask for volunteers for that."

TJ 耸了耸肩：“莱布肖特中尉指派我负责支援排，这意味着将它接入城市电网进行发电是我的任务。所以自从你把它带进来后，我一整天都在研究它的系统，对其有了些了解。葛城中尉在她所知范围内给予了帮助，向我解释了她所了解的情况，而且我排里有个新来的列兵，他对这东西的工作原理似乎理解得很透彻，所以我们比预想的要快地完成了任务。考虑到你们这里相当低下的常规技术基础和几乎不存在的灵能技术基础，我惊讶于它竟拥有如此多的灵魂技术。但如果你们之前能让它运转，我们或许也能有所作为。不过，除非真的到了山穷水尽的地步，否则我们不会尝试。我们几乎得进行人祭才能让它动起来，而我绝对不想为此征集志愿者。”

Shinji looked up at the purple and green titan he'd once Piloted. He suppressed a shiver. "And I'm the only person who's ever driven it. So if it comes to it, I'll probably be the one everyone asks to do it again." 'And I really don't want to do that again, especially after the last time. I'd rather make my father suffer through it. Let him see what it was like for once.'

真嗣抬头望向那紫绿相间的巨人，他曾驾驶过的存在。他强压下颤抖。“而我是唯一一个曾驾驶过它的人。所以，如果真到了那一步，大家可能都会来求我再次驾驶。”‘而我真的不想再经历一次，尤其是在上次之后。我宁愿让我父亲去承受这一切。让他也体验一次那是什么感觉。’

"You sound like you'd rather chew your own leg off than do that. I'll see if we can find someone else to volunteer for that slot if it comes to it," TJ said.

你听起来宁愿咬断自己的腿也不愿做那事。如果真到了那一步，我会看看能否找到其他人自愿填补那个空缺。

"Thank you." 谢谢。

"Besides, wouldn't the Pilot have to be someone who had a bond with the soul I put in the core? We probably won't be using anyone on your list, so you're out of the running anyway."

再说了，驾驶员不应该是与核心中我注入的灵魂有联系的人吗？我们大概不会用你名单上的人，所以你也没戏了。

Shinji shrugged wary acceptance. "I guess so." He looked back up at TJ. "'The soul you put in it', huh? Where do you learn how to do 'soul work' anyway?"

真嗣带着戒备接受了这一说法，耸了耸肩。“我想是的。”他抬头看向 TJ。“‘你注入的灵魂’，是吗？你到底是从哪儿学会做‘灵魂工作’的？”

"That's just the problem. I didn't learn it anywhere. I just know I can do it because I'm a Prince Of The Blood. Spiritual powers come with the territory."

问题就在这里。我并非从何处习得。我只是知道我能做到，因为我是皇族血脉的王子。精神力量是与生俱来的。

"How do you mean? How does being a Prince Of The Blood mean you have powers like that?"

你这是什么意思？作为皇室血脉的王子，怎么就意味着你拥有那样的力量呢？

TJ looked at him strangely. "Um, I'm a direct descendant of the Lord and Lady? The whole divine heritage thing? It's part of my genome, built in."

TJ 奇怪地看着他。“呃，我是领主和夫人的直系后裔？那个神圣血统的事？它是我基因的一部分，天生就有的。”

Shinji blinked. That couldn't be what it sounded like. Well, it did sound a bit like the official legend of the Emperor of Japan's family origin; descended from the goddess Amaterasu and such. Avalon must have a similar legend. But wait… TJ was saying he had actual powers to work with people's souls from it. That's a lot of faith to put in just a story. So ask the question, Ikari. "The Lord and Lady are the gods of Avalon?" he asked hesitantly. TJ nodded. "Does… I mean, is it like the Amaterasu legend from my country? Does your great grandfather, the Emperor, claim descent from the Lord and Lady like the Emperor of Japan does from the Sun Goddess?"

真嗣眨了眨眼。那不可能是他所理解的意思。确实，这听起来有点像日本天皇家族起源的官方传说；据说是从天照大神等神祇那里传承下来的。阿瓦隆一定也有类似的传说。但等等……TJ 是在说他真的拥有从这些传说中获得的力量，能够影响人们的灵魂。这可是对一个故事极大的信任。所以，问出来吧，碇。“领主和夫人，他们是阿瓦隆的神吗？”他迟疑地问道。TJ 点了点头。“那……我的意思是，它像我国关于天照大神的传说吗？你的曾祖父，也就是皇帝，是否也像日本天皇宣称从太阳女神那里继承血统一样，宣称自己是从领主和夫人那里传承下来的？”

TJ looked even more puzzled. "No, how could they claim descent from themselves?"

TJ 看起来更加困惑了。“不，他们怎么可能声称从自己那里继承血统呢？”

"What?" "什么？"

"My mother's maternal grandparents are the Lord and Lady."

我母亲的祖父母是勋爵和夫人。

"I thought you said those were the gods of Avalon?"

我以为你说那些是阿瓦隆的神明呢？

TJ paused and held his finger up. "Are you messing with me or is one of us missing something?"

TJ 停顿了一下，竖起手指：“你是故意逗我，还是我们中有人漏掉了什么？”

Shinji shook his head. "I'm not messing with you. But it's sounding like you're saying your great-grandparents don't claim descent from gods, but that they aregods."

真嗣摇了摇头。“我不是在跟你开玩笑。但听起来你好像在说，你的曾祖父母并非声称来自神的后裔，而是他们本身就是神。”

TJ nodded again. "Right."

TJ 再次点头。“对。”

The two young men stared at each other for a long moment. Shinji's thoughts boggled as he tried to fit TJ's apparent confirmation into what he thought he knew. "I'd heard them addressed as 'Lord and Lady' a few times over the last few days, but I'd assumed it was a title or something. It's not just a title, is it? They really are gods, spiritual entities, and you have spiritual powers because you're descended from them," he ventured carefully.

两位年轻人长久地凝视着对方。新二思绪纷乱，试图将 TJ 明显的确认与他自以为知晓的事实相融合。“过去几天里，我几次听到他们被称为‘主和夫人’，但我以为那只是一个头衔或什么的。它不仅仅是一个头衔，对吧？他们真的是神，是灵体，而你拥有灵力，是因为你是他们的后裔，”他小心翼翼地试探道。

TJ nodded once more. "Ah… yeah. No one told you? I would have thought their auras made it rather obvious. It's pretty distinctive. You talked to the Lord yesterday morning, face to face."

TJ 再次点了点头。“啊…对。没人告诉你吗？我以为他们的气场已经很明显了。相当独特。你昨天早上和那位大人面对面交谈过。”

"I… can't see auras or anything like that."

我……看不到气场之类的东西。

"You can't? Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense. You wouldn't have grown up with it since the spiritual background on this world is pretty low level, right? No gods or such around, except for that weird background presence that I guess is Miss Ayanami. Wait, if she's your sister, how is talking to a god a surprise for you? For that matter, why aren't you more spiritually aware yourself? You've got some really strange traces of something in your aura that are sort of like her flavor." He peered at the air around Shinji's head more closely.

你做不到？哦，也对，这倒说得通。你在这个世界长大，这里的灵性背景相当低级，对吧？没有神明之类的存在，除了那位背景中奇怪的存在，我想应该是绫波小姐。等等，如果她是你的姐姐，你为何会对与神交谈感到惊讶？话说回来，你自己为何没有更敏锐的灵性意识？你的气场中有些非常奇怪的痕迹，有点像她的气息。他更仔细地审视着真嗣头顶的空气。

Shinji shrugged. This was a very strange conversation. "Rei is my… half-sister. Her power comes from her being Lilith, not from the blood we share. And she wasn't… obviously powerful when I knew her before the Third Impact. I guess what you're seeing on me is leftovers from Instrumentality. I was… sort of a god for a few minutes, I think. I didn't handle it very well." He waved a hand at the world in general. "This is what came of it."

真嗣耸了耸肩。这是一场非常奇怪的对话。“绫波是我的……同父异母的妹妹。她的力量源自她是莉莉丝，而非我们共有的血脉。而且在我认识她时，在第三次冲击之前，她并没有表现出明显的强大。我想你现在在我身上看到的，应该是人类补完计划后的残留。我曾经……算是当了那么几分钟的神吧，我觉得。我处理得并不好。”他挥手示意着周围的世界，“这就是结果。”

TJ shrugged back at him. "Eh, I've heard of worse. You sounded like you weren't in the best mental place to handle that sort of power at the time. You didn't destroy the world, we're here now to fix what's wrong, and if we can make it all right in the end, it's far better than it could have ended up if your father or SEELE had gotten that power instead, right?" He gave Shinji a wry smile. "For a dude who grew up on a world without gods, you're sure taking this calmly. Does having one for a half-sister help?"

TJ 朝他耸了耸肩，“哎，我听过更糟的。当时你听起来精神状态不佳，难以驾驭那种力量。你没毁灭世界，我们现在来修复问题，如果能最终让一切恢复正常，这总比让你父亲或 SEELE 得到那力量要好得多，对吧？”他向真嗣露出一个苦笑，“对于一个在无神论世界长大的人来说，你倒是挺镇定的。有个半神姐姐是不是有帮助？”

"Instrumentality set a high bar of 'strange' for me. I saw whole other worlds in there. I don't think anything else in my life is going to match that. And I've had a strange last few days anyhow. Four days ago, a me from six months in my future convinced me to follow a guy who appeared out of thin air through a portal to a whole new world, and it's all been through the looking glass since then. That he's apparently a god seems like par for the course right now…" TJ barked a laugh, but Shinji sighed. "I suppose in six months I'll understand why I didn't just tell myself that up front."

《工具理性》为我设定了“奇异”的高标准。我在其中窥见了截然不同的世界。我想我此生再难有经历与之匹敌。何况，最近几天我也过得颇为离奇。四天前，来自未来六个月后的我，说服我跟随一个凭空出现的家伙，穿越门户，踏入一个全新的世界，自那以后，一切仿佛都颠倒了过来。而他显然是一位神明，如今看来，这似乎也不过是情理之中……”TJ 发出一声干笑，但真嗣却叹了口气。“或许六个月后，我会明白为何当初没有直接告诉我自己。”

"Would you have done anything differently if you'd known?" TJ asked.

"如果当时知道，你会不会做出不同的选择？" TJ 问道。

Shinji thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. "I don't know. I don't think so. It's just really weird to think about it. It seems like the kind of thing that would be one of the first things you'd tell somebody when you meet them."

真嗣思索了片刻，随后耸了耸肩。“我不知道，我觉得不是。只是想想都觉得挺奇怪的。这似乎是那种你一见面就会告诉别人的事情之一。”

"What, like 'Hi there! I'm a god! Derp derp!'" TJ laughed. "I can't imagine why he doesn't just announce that every time he enters a room. Seriously, it's not like anyone on Avalon doesn't know, so he really doesn't have to. And in your case, I can only guess here, but maybe it's so it wouldn't blow your mind too much. Or maybe why you didn't tell 'yourself' at the beginning; it doesn't matter, since you wouldn't have done anything differently."

"什么，就像'嗨，这里！我是神！得儿得儿！'" TJ 笑道，"我真想不出他为什么每次进房间不直接宣布这个。说真的，在阿瓦隆没人不知道，所以他真的没必要这么做。至于你，我只能猜测，或许是为了不让你太震惊。或者你一开始没告诉'自己'的原因；这无关紧要，因为你也不会因此做出什么不同的事。"

"I guess so." Shinji sank his head into his hands. 'A couple of gods have been having us as guests for the last few days. Just one more thing Asuka was right about: these people are really strange. Oh gods, Asuka… what am I going to say to her? I just freaked out and ran off. She must be incredibly angry at me for doing that. Now I'll have to explain to her why, tell her 'I'm sorry' yet again, and ask her to help me avoid turning into my damn father.' He wrapped his arms around himself and rubbed his shoulders. He really wanted to feel her arms around him right now. The whole world felt better when she was touching him, like it could all work out somehow. Having the redheaded beauty in his arms had been an impossible dream for so long, now that he'd actually tasted it, when he held her he could imagine he could do anything. He hoped fervently he hadn't somehow screwed things up with this. 'She's going to want an answer as to what to do with Don Barceló, too.' He grimaced at the reminder of the ethical question that had sparked his uncomfortable realization about his similarity to his father. 'I suppose I'll just have to try to consider it as dispassionately as I can… and agree with whatever Asuka wants. I sure as Hell trust her judgment on this more than my own. She can't possibly want to do worse to him than I do.'

"我想也是。" 真嗣将头埋进双手中。过去几天，几位神明一直将我们当作宾客款待。正如明日香所言，这些人确实古怪。哦，神啊，明日香……我该如何向她解释？我只是一时慌乱逃跑了。她一定对我此举怒不可遏。现在我必须向她解释缘由，再次道歉，并请求她帮我避免变成我那该死的父亲。" 他双臂环抱自己，轻抚肩膀。此刻，他多么渴望感受到她的拥抱。当她触碰他时，整个世界似乎都变得美好，仿佛一切都能迎刃而解。长久以来，将那位红发美人拥入怀中一直是遥不可及的梦想，如今终于实现，每当他拥抱她，仿佛就能无所不能。他热切希望自己没有因此搞砸一切。她还会要求我给出一个关于如何处理唐·巴塞洛的答案。" 想到这个引发他对自己与父亲相似之处不安认识的道德难题，他不禁皱起了眉头。 我想我只能尽可能冷静地考虑这件事……并同意明日香想要的一切。我绝对比相信自己的判断更信任她在这件事上的决定。她不可能想对他做的比我还狠。'

The press of a cold can against the back of his hand brought him out of his reverie. He lifted his head to stare at the can of soda. TJ was holding out to him. "I don't know if you're a drinking man, so I'll hold off on the flask of whiskey, but you look like you could use a drink, dude," he said.

冰凉的饮料罐贴在手背上，将他从沉思中唤醒。他抬起头，目光落在 TJ 递过来的汽水罐上。"我不知道你是不是喝酒的人，所以先不给你威士忌，但老兄，你看起来正需要喝上一口。"他说道。

Shinji blinked as he reached up to take the can. He was sure TJ hadn't moved from where he'd been sitting across from him. He was just as sure TJ hadn't been holding drinks either, and there was nowhere right around them where he could have grabbed them from. "Where did you get this?" His hands automatically opened it and he took a drink.

碇真嗣眨了眨眼，伸手接过罐子。他确信 TJ 并没有从对面坐的位置移动过，也同样确信 TJ 并没有拿着饮料，而且他们周围也没有任何地方可以让他拿到饮料。“你这是从哪儿弄来的？”他的手不由自主地打开了罐子，随即喝了一口。

TJ reached under his arm like he was pulling something out from a jacket pocket and pulled a second can out of thin air. He popped the top with a hiss of carbonation and smiled. "Holdout Pocket technique. A little spatial fold tied to your personal space, good for keeping an emergency backup weapon or something handy. I also keep cold drinks in mine. It's not a hard trick to learn. First year Weapon Theory stuff. I could probably teach you pretty quickly if you've got a gun or a knife you'd like to try it on."

TJ 伸手仿佛从夹克口袋中抽出某物，凭空又掏出一罐饮料。他啪地一声打开，伴随着碳酸的嘶嘶声，微笑道：“这是藏匿口袋技巧，将一小块空间折叠与个人领域相连，适合存放紧急备用武器或随手可取之物。我还在里面放了冷饮。这技巧不难学，属于武器理论一年级的内容。如果你有枪或刀，我或许能很快教会你如何使用这招。”

"I don't really like guns."

我其实不太喜欢枪。

"Neither did my father, but he always had one on him. He always said 'better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.' We're going to be in hostile country for the foreseeable future, so you might want to be ready for unhappy natives."

我父亲也没有，但他总是随身携带。他常说“有备无患总比需要时却无备要好。”我们未来一段时间将处于敌对地区，所以你或许应该准备好应对不友好的当地人。

"Um, thanks, but I'll pass for tonight. I need to find Asuka and apologize for running off like I did. I need her to… I need her to…"

"呃，谢谢，但今晚我就不去了。我得找到明日香，为之前那样跑掉向她道歉。我需要她……我需要她……"

"You need her." TJ grinned. "So go to her, dude. We can talk later. She's in the command pit with Top and Lieutenant Leibshott."

"你需要她。" TJ 咧嘴一笑，"那就去找她吧，伙计。我们晚点再聊。她和 Top 还有 Lieutenant Leibshott 在指挥所里。"

Shinji drained the rest of his can and put it down where he'd been sitting as he rose. The cold drink had calmed his still-roiling stomach a little. "Thank you, TJ." He took off running towards the command pit, with a little less headlong speed than he'd arrived on the field and a steadier look on his face.

真嗣喝完了罐中剩余的饮料，将其放在起身处的地面上。冰冷的饮品稍稍平息了他仍在翻腾的胃。“谢谢你，TJ。”他开始向指挥坑跑去，速度虽不及他刚到战场时那般急促，但脸上的表情却更加坚定。

### Chapter 29 Hold Me Up, Hold Me Back - Feelings

"See? Good advice for any occasion." Ching put the small leather-bound e-guidebook with 'DON'T PANIC' written in large, friendly letters on the cover back in her hip pocket. "I'm just saying, Asuka, you don't need to worry too much about this. Whatever's eating Shinji, I am one hundred percent positive he's not going to let it get between him and the best thing in his world."

"看吧？任何场合都适用的忠告。" 青将那本封面印有"别慌"二字的小巧皮革电子指南书放回裤兜。"我只是想说，明日香，你不必对此过于担忧。无论是什么困扰着真嗣，我百分百确信他不会让它妨碍到他生命中最美好的事物。"

"Me," Asuka replied quietly, though the tone was far closer to a question than she'd have liked.

"我，"明日香轻声回答，尽管语气更接近于疑问，这并非她所愿。

Ching still nodded firmly. "You. Come on, Asuka. You really think he's going to be so crazy as to decide he doesn't want to be around you anymore two days after finally confessing how he's felt about you for years? I think it's more likely I'll be named Chief Abbott of Saint Cream-Muffin-up-the-Bum-with-Jam next Thursday. Or that Sergeant Tightpants here is going to even protest when I decide to grab his firm bums, haul him into my bunk, and make him say my name."

青依然坚定地点头。“你，明日香，你真的认为他会疯狂到在终于向你坦白多年感情后的两天就决定不想再见到你了吗？我觉得下周四我被任命为圣奶油松饼夹心酱寺院首席住持的可能性还大些。或者，当我要抓住这位紧身裤警官的结实臀部，把他拖进我的铺位，让他叫出我的名字时，他甚至都不会抗议。”

Sergeant Bir looked up from the battle table and gave Ching a raised eyebrow. "Excuse me, ma'am?"

比尔中士从战术桌前抬起头，对青挑了挑眉毛。“不好意思，女士？”

Ching grinned wickedly back at the taller NCO. "I've seen you checking out my 'thrusters', Top. Almost as much as I've been checking out yours. Not that I'm displeased, either."

青对着那位高个子士官邪魅一笑：“我可看见你老盯着我的‘推进器’了，头儿。几乎跟我盯你的频率一样。倒也不是我不乐意。”

Asuka gave Ching her own look. "Don't you guys have rules about fraternization or something?" Ching was reminding her a bit of Misato at the moment.

明日香给了阿静一个自己的眼神。“你们难道没有关于交往之类的规定吗？”此刻，阿静让她想起了美里。

Ching was still smiling as she looked back to Asuka. "We do, but I'm technically in another service branch anyway, the rules are relaxed a bit under a Code Dragonfly, subject to further modification according to the commander's wishes as well, and ultimately governed by good sense and Avaloni custom regarding affairs of the heart. Happily, the commander here is you, and you're not going to tell me I can't lasso this tasty hunk of man-meat and ride him around the corral a few times when we're both off duty, will you?" Ching batted her eyes at Asuka with a comical innocent look on her face.

青依然面带微笑地回头看向飞鸟。“我们确实有规定，但我实际上隶属于另一个部门，在龙飞指令下，规则会宽松一些，还可以根据指挥官的意愿进一步调整，最终受制于理智和阿瓦隆习俗对情感事务的约束。幸运的是，这里的指挥官是你，你不会告诉我，我不能在我们都下班后，用套索套住这块美味的男子肉，骑着他绕马厩转几圈吧，对吗？”青眨巴着眼睛，脸上带着滑稽的无辜表情。

"Do I get a vote in this, ladies?" Sergeant Bir put in dryly.

"在这件事上我有投票权吗，女士们？" 比尔中士干巴巴地插话道。

"You going to say no?" Ching asked sweetly.

"你要拒绝吗？"青儿甜甜地问道。

"Not likely, but it makes a girl feel special when a handsome boy asks, you know," he deadpanned right back at her.

"不太可能，但一个英俊的男孩来邀请，总能让女孩感觉自己很特别，你懂的。" 他一本正经地回敬她。

"Heh. Anyhow, Asuka, just stay calm. Shinji's talking to Lieutenant O'Brien down in the football pitch right now, and I think he's calming down."

呵呵，总之，明日香，保持冷静。真嗣现在正在足球场上和奥布赖恩中尉谈话，我觉得他正在平静下来。

"How do you know that?" Asuka asked, puzzled. Ching had been walking with her since they'd left the area with the prisoners, and hadn't made any calls on her wristband or anything.

"你怎么知道的？"明日香困惑地问道。自从他们离开囚犯区域后，青就一直和她一起走着，并没有用她的腕带打电话或做其他事情。

Ching tapped the side of her head lightly with a finger. "Imperial military mental link. Great for keeping in contact in combat, just as handy other times too. Most native Avaloni are strong natural telepaths anyway, and the Imperial Family even more so. He sent me a 'head's up' that he'd run into him when I put out a call for anyone who saw him to keep an eye on him. He was upset enough we weren't going to let him run off alone and maybe do something rash. I told you you didn't need to worry, Asuka. We watch out for each other."

青轻轻地用手指敲了敲自己的头。“帝国军事心灵链接。战斗中保持联系非常方便，平时也同样好用。大多数阿瓦隆本地人本来就是强大的自然心灵感应者，皇室成员更是如此。当我发出通知，要求任何看到他的人留意他时，他给我发了个‘提醒’，告诉我他遇到了他。他很不安，因为我们不会让他独自跑掉，可能会做出什么冲动的事。我告诉过你，你不用担心，飞鸟。我们互相照应。”

"Numquam Soli," Sergeant Bir murmured. "We take it seriously, ma'am."

"永不孤单，"比尔中士低声说道，"我们对此非常认真，女士。"

'The last thing I want to be right now is alone,' Asuka thought. 'But it's not Ching and Sergeant Bir I want with me. Damn it, Shinji. Why did you just leave all of a sudden? Why did you have to run away from me like that? And why did it make me nearly lose it when he did? Gott damn it, Sohryu, you're tougher than that! Keep it together!' It was hard, though. Her hand twitched, seeking the newly familiar grip she was rapidly becoming accustomed to. It didn't feel right, not to have him there beside her anymore. She wanted him back, now! She tried to channel the intense desire into some kind of anger, her old friend, but the feeling stubbornly remained a gnawing ache instead.

此刻我最不想的就是孤单，'明日香心想。但陪伴我的不该是青和伯尔中士。该死，真嗣，你为何突然离去？为何要那样逃离我？而他那样做时，我几乎崩溃，这又是为何？该死的，惣流，你比这更坚强！振作起来！'然而，这很难。她的手不由自主地抽动，寻找着那个她正迅速习惯的新触感。没有他在身边，感觉就是不对。她渴望他回来，立刻！她试图将这强烈的渴望转化为某种愤怒，她昔日的伙伴，但这种感觉却顽固地停留在一种啃噬般的痛苦中。

Ching lightly bonked her on the top of the head with a cup of coffee. "Oi. Here. Drink." When Asuka raised her head, Ching thrust the cup into her hands. "Plus," she continued, "I'm a bloody psychiatrist. I'm not doing any of this by accident, Asuka. I know better than to let someone in that much emotional distress run completely loose, but also not to box him in too tight. Whatever was upsetting him, you were too close to the cause to be the one to go after him just then. He needed to run away before he burst a seam in front of you, something I think he'd rather not do. So I let him run himself tired, then had Lieutenant O'Brien talk to him since he was closest, to cool him down and get his mind off whatever was tearing him up. I'm also flirting with Sergeant Bir because it's something lighthearted and fun for you to think about instead of worrying yourself into either a rage or a depression. Ok, I'll admit it's also because he's got a really cute ass. But it's mostly to keep you distracted for as long as it takes Shinji to pull himself together and get his carcass back here."

青轻轻地用一杯咖啡在她头顶轻敲了一下。“喂，给，喝吧。”当明日香抬头时，青将杯子塞进她手里。“再说，”她接着说，“我可是个正经的心理医生。我这么做绝非偶然，明日香。我知道不能让情绪极度困扰的人完全放任自流，但也不能把他逼得太紧。无论是什么让他心烦意乱，你离原因太近，当时不该去追他。他需要先逃离，以免在你面前崩溃，我想他宁愿不这么做。所以我让他跑累了，然后让离他最近的奥布赖恩中尉去跟他谈谈，让他冷静下来，忘掉那些让他心烦意乱的事。我也在和比尔中士调情，因为这是件轻松有趣的事，让你不必陷入愤怒或抑郁。好吧，我承认也是因为他有个非常可爱的屁股。但主要是为了让你分心，直到真嗣自己振作起来，把他的身体拖回来。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes as she took a sip of the surprisingly decent coffee, the hot liquid burning its way down to her knotted stomach. Ching acted so much like a slightly more mature Misato most of the time that it was very easy to forget she was a four-century-old PhD and veteran mecha pilot. "Should I thank you for the effort, or be annoyed that you're manipulating me?" she asked, a little sharply.

明日香眯起眼睛，抿了一口意外不错的咖啡，滚烫的液体一路灼烧至她纠结的胃部。大多数时候，青的行为与稍显成熟的美里极为相似，以至于很容易忘记她其实是一位拥有四百年智慧的博士和资深机甲驾驶员。“我是该感谢你的用心，还是该恼火你又在操控我？”她略带尖锐地问道。

"Well, since I'm telling you about exactly what I'm doing step by step as I do it, I'm not sure it counts as manipulation, exactly," Ching said with a droll expression. "Or maybe that's exactly what I'm doing with a clever double-back fake out. But maybe I know you know that, so I really am being apparently honest and manipulating you even more secretly!"

“好吧，既然我正在一步一步地告诉你我正在做什么，我不确定这算不算操纵，”青用一种戏谑的表情说道，“或者这正是我用一个巧妙的回马枪来操纵的方式。但也许我知道你已经意识到了这一点，所以我其实是在表面上坦诚，而更隐秘地操纵你！”

Asuka just rolled her eyes. "Come on, Ching."

明日香只是翻了个白眼。“得了吧，阿静。”

Ching's face became more serious. "Seriously, Asuka, I'm under direct orders from the Emperor himself to be your friend before I'm your doc, and not to lie to you. You think I'm going to even try being dishonest with you or mess with your thinking? He'd be….ah, rather cross with me if I did. And the Empress would go to work on me. I really am just trying to keep your spirits up and your mind occupied to keep you from getting depressed or worried right now. My professional skills just let me do that more consciously and deliberately than if I was just a friend winging it." Ching sighed and rubbed the side of her neck. "Though I'd really rather we had Lieutenant Horaki here to talk to you too, but she had a rough day yesterday after all the stuff she saw at the Casa Rosada. I had to give her something to sleep after she talked with me about it. She'll probably still be knocked out for a little longer."

青的脸色变得严肃起来。“说真的，明日香，皇帝亲自下令，让我先做你的朋友，再做你的医生，并且不得对你撒谎。你认为我会试图对你不诚实或扰乱你的思绪吗？如果我那样做，他肯定会……啊，对我相当不满。而皇后也会对我下手。我确实只是想提振你的精神，让你的思绪忙碌起来，以免你陷入抑郁或焦虑。我的专业技能让我能更自觉、更有意识地做到这一点，而不只是作为朋友随意为之。”青叹了口气，揉了揉脖子侧面。“虽然我更希望堀木中尉也能在这里和你交谈，但她昨天在玫瑰宫目睹了一切后，情绪很糟糕。我和她谈过后，不得不给她用了些助眠的东西。她可能还得再睡一会儿。”

Asuka closed her eyes for a moment. Hikari. She had to have seen evidence of at least some of what Don Barceló was now suffering through the reliving of. It had to have been a very nasty shock for her now much younger friend. Asuka had had four years of living through the brutality that the post-Third Impact warlords could come up with to become, if not accustomed, at least no longer shocked by it. Hikari had essentially walked straight out of their mostly normal life in Tokyo-3 into the horrors with almost no warning. "I…Gott, I'm glad she's here, but just as much I wish she wasn't."

明日香闭上眼睛片刻。光。她必定目睹了唐·巴塞洛如今在回忆中经历的某些苦难。这对她那位年轻许多的朋友来说，必定是一次极其恶劣的震惊。明日香经历了四年的战后军阀暴行，即便未能习惯，至少不再为之震惊。而光几乎毫无预警地，直接从他们在第三新东京市相对正常的生活踏入了这些恐怖之中。“我……天啊，我很高兴她在这里，但同样地，我也希望她不在。”

Ching nodded. "You want to protect your friends from the kind of evils you had to go through. I understand. But this is your world. It's broken and battered, but we've got to fix it if you and yours are going to be able to live in it. For all the shock I'd say it's better that Lieutenant Horaki is here than not. She'd learn about all this nastiness one day, and it's better that she's here with us and with the rest of your friends. As bad as running into all this is, it would only be worse if she was helpless and impotent to do anything about it. As long as she's here with us, she can heal the afflicted and punish the wicked. Agency is a powerful antidote to the shock of encounters with evil like this."

青点了点头。"你想保护你的朋友们，不让他们经历你所遭遇的那些邪恶。我理解。但这是你的世界，它支离破碎，伤痕累累，但如果你们要在这里生活，我们就必须修复它。尽管这一切令人震惊，但我认为霍拉基中尉在这里总比不在要好。她总有一天会了解到这些丑恶，而她在这里，与你们和其他朋友在一起，情况会更好。尽管面对这一切很糟糕，但如果她无能为力，无法对此做出任何反应，那只会更糟。只要她与我们同在，她就能治愈受苦者，惩戒邪恶之徒。拥有行动的能力，是对抗这种邪恶遭遇带来的冲击的强大解药。"

'The topic of 'punishing the wicked' is what made Shinji run off. What am I supposed to think about that?' Depression surged forward again, warring with her disgust at Don Barceló's crimes and desire to punish him. She could not let a man like that, like Winthrop and too many others, simply escape the full measure of justice due him. But what about Shinji and his reaction? Why had he run? Why- Gott, she wished Hikari was awake. Or away from here. Or even Misato or somebody was here to talk to…No. She knew what she wanted. 'Good Gott, I really do want that baka right here with me. I want to talk to him. Damn me, I even want him to hold me and make me feel better. Get back here, baka-Shinji! I n-…want you here! How dare you leave me like this?' Asuka used the faint flicker of anger under the worry to get a grip on herself. She refused to let herself break down in front of people like Winthrop for years. She could handle this. But doing so was hard, harder than it had been for a long time. Ching was right about that much, at least; she needed to keep herself occupied.

关于'惩恶'的话题让真嗣跑掉了。我该怎么想这件事？'抑郁再次涌上心头，与她对唐·巴塞洛罪行的厌恶及惩罚他的欲望交战。她不能让那样的人，像温思罗普和太多其他人一样，轻易逃脱应有的正义制裁。但真嗣和他的反应呢？他为什么要跑？为什么——天啊，她希望明日香醒着。或者离开这里。甚至美里或某人在此交谈也好……不。她知道自己想要什么。天啊，我真的希望那个笨蛋就在我身边。我想和他说话。该死，我甚至希望他抱着我，让我感觉好些。回来吧，笨蛋真嗣！我——想你在这里！你怎么敢就这样离开我？'明日香利用担忧之下微弱的愤怒来控制自己。多年来，她拒绝在温思罗普这样的人面前崩溃。她能应对这个。但这样做很难，比长时间以来都要难。青说得对，至少这一点；她需要让自己忙起来。

She shook herself and turned to Sergeant Bir, still quietly standing at a semi-parade rest by the battle table. "What are we doing today? We've got the city under control, correct?"

她抖了抖身子，转向仍静静地以半立正姿势站在战术桌旁的比尔中士。“我们今天有什么安排？城市已经在我们的掌控之中，对吧？”

He nodded sharply. "Yes, ma'am." He touched a virtual button on the table and several icons flashed. "We've got Don Barceló's arsenal and vehicle park taken care of, the city utilities are getting back online under Lieutenant O'Brien's Support Platoon, and we're sending patrols out to La Plata, Zarate, and Lobos this morning. We might need you and Lieutenant Ikari in Red Whirlwind for a show of force if any of them put up resistance, but we don't anticipate-"

他果断地点了点头。“是的，女士。”他轻触桌上的虚拟按钮，几个图标随即闪烁。“我们已经处理了唐·巴塞洛的武器库和车辆场，城市公用设施正在奥布赖恩中尉支援排的协助下恢复运行，今天早上我们正派遣巡逻队前往拉普拉塔、扎拉特和洛沃斯。如果他们中有人抵抗，可能需要您和伊卡里中尉驾驶红色旋风进行武力展示，但我们预计不会——”

Asuka let her mind absorb the plan for the day's maneuvers and forced the rest of her thoughts down. Shinji would come back. He would come back and be with her and everything would be alright. He had to. He'd promised.

明日香让自己的思绪吸收了当天行动的计划，并强行压制了其他杂念。真嗣会回来的。他会回来，与她在一起，一切都会好起来的。他必须这么做。他承诺过。

It was at least thirty minutes of plans and operations briefings later when Ching and Sergeant Bir both suddenly raised their heads and nodded to each other. Asuka watched them curiously as they walked over to the double doors that were the entrance to the room they'd chosen for the command pit without a word. They each took a hold of one of the door handles and simultaneously pulled the doors open, revealing a panting Shinji just raising his hand to push the door open. His headlong run trailed off into a confused halt just inside the doors. However, he did not look to his sides to see why the doors had opened for him. His eyes instantly locked with Asuka's as he ran in, and stayed fixed right there as he came to a stop across the battle table from her.

至少过了三十分钟的计划和行动简报后，Ching 和 Bir 中士突然同时抬头，互相点头示意。Asuka 好奇地看着他们一言不发地走向他们选作指挥所的房间入口的双开门。两人各自握住一个门把手，同时拉开大门，露出正要推门而入、气喘吁吁的 Shinji。他那急促的奔跑在门内戛然而止，显得有些困惑。然而，他并没有向两侧看去探究门为何为他打开。他的目光一进门就与 Asuka 的相遇，并在他停下脚步，隔着战斗桌与她对峙时，始终紧紧锁定。

She bit the inside of her cheek sharply to keep a relieved smile from breaking out on her face, and did her best to convert her look of surprise into a familiar glower. Keeping her hands firmly planted on the surface of the table was even tougher, but it was necessary to keep her from running over to his side of the table, dragging him into her arms, and filling his ears with apologies and pleas he never do that again. She couldn't do that. She just couldn't.

她用力咬住脸颊内侧，以防释然的笑容在脸上绽放，竭力将惊讶的神情转为熟悉的怒视。双手紧贴桌面更是难以维持，但她必须克制自己，不冲到他那边，将他拥入怀中，在他耳边不断道歉和恳求他再也不要那样做。她不能那么做，就是不能。

'Why can't I? He's mine, and I want him.' But she couldn't show weakness like that. Not even to him. Especially not to him. 'Not yet.' Wait, 'not yet'? To that baka? 'The one you just admitted you want to hold you and make you feel better? The one you're already uncomfortable without him by your side? The one you're already counting the hours until you can be back in bed next to? Face it, Sohryu, you want him. He's the only one who can possibly understand you. And somehow still wants you. And yes, 'not yet', because you already trust him more than anyone else around here. Even Kaji or Hikari.' That…that can't be true. He…he let me die because he was spineless wimp. He almost did it again in Berlin! I-

我为什么不能？他是我的，我想要他。'但她不能那样示弱，甚至不能在他面前，尤其是不能在他面前。'还不是时候。'等等，'还不是时候'？对那个笨蛋？那个你刚承认想要拥抱你、让你感觉好些的人？那个你已经不习惯他不在身边的人？那个你已经在计算着何时能再次躺在他身边的人？面对现实吧，惣流，你想要他。他是唯一可能理解你的人。而且不知怎么地，他仍然想要你。是的，'还不是时候'，因为你已经比这里的任何人都更信任他。甚至超过加持或光。'那……那不可能是真的。他……他让我死去，因为他是个懦弱的胆小鬼。在柏林他差点又这么做！我——

Her groping for an excuse to counter the seductive voice of weakness in her head was abruptly cut short when the world suddenly got better. Her racing pulse began to slow, and she felt herself relaxing, tensed muscles unclenching. A small sigh did escape her lips this time…

她正摸索着借口来反驳脑海中那诱人的软弱声音，世界突然变得更好，这一过程戛然而止。她的心跳开始放缓，感到自己逐渐放松，紧绷的肌肉也松弛下来。这次，她的小嘴不禁发出了一声轻叹……

Shinji's arms were around her.

真嗣的双臂环绕着她。

He'd come around the battle table while she'd been arguing with herself and wrapped his arms around her from her left. Asuka was faintly surprised that he was shaking. His breath tickled her ear as he just held her, his mouth working like he was searching for words.

他趁她自言自语之际，从左侧悄然靠近，双臂环抱住她。明日香微感惊讶，因为他竟在颤抖。他紧抱着她，气息轻拂她的耳畔，嘴唇翕动，似在寻找合适的言语。

Eventually, he spoke. "Asuka… I… I… I'm sorry. I didn't mean to run off like that, I just…" His voice dropped to an even softer level. "I think… I'm learning who I am, and I don't like some of what that is. I need you. I need you to help me." His own shaking had subsided as he held her. A quiet, bitter laugh escaped him. "You'd think the philosophy would help deal with it. Or I would have thought. You'll just point out that the math would have shown it perfectly clearly and I should have known already…"

最终，他开口了：“明日香……我……我……对不起。我不是故意那样跑掉的，只是……”他的声音变得更加低沉，“我想……我正在了解自己，但有些方面我并不喜欢。我需要你。我需要你来帮助我。”当他拥抱着她时，自己的颤抖已经平息。他发出了一声苦涩的轻笑，“你可能会认为哲学能帮助应对这一切。或者说我本该这么想。你会指出，数学本已清晰地揭示了一切，我早该明白……”

Asuka managed not to jerk the first time when Shinji said 'I need you'. The second time had echoes of his plea to her during Instrumentality that brought a wave of unpleasant feelings to her…but it was even more terrifying now that things were different. She knew he really was asking her because it was her, not just because he was afraid of the First or Misato. She was the only one who could understand him, too, after all. But he really was still frightened enough about something to be holding her like a life preserver. And now he was saying something about math? Huh?

明日香第一次听到真嗣说“我需要你”时，勉强没有做出反应。第二次时，他的恳求让她想起了在人类补完计划期间的情景，激起了一阵不愉快的情绪……但现在情况不同了，这更加令人恐惧。她知道他真的是在向她求助，是因为她，而不是因为害怕初号机或美里。毕竟，她是唯一能理解他的人。但他现在显然因为某种事情仍然害怕到紧紧抓住她，仿佛她是救生圈。而现在他又提到了数学？什么？

"What are you talking about, baka?" She struggled to keep at least a little bite to her tone. She wanted, more strongly than she'd wanted to think about right now, to bury her face into his chest, shut the world away for a while, and enjoy the feeling of someone holding her that she wanted to have hold her. But if he was asking her for help, it might be a bad time for her to lean on him as well. Damn it. "And why the Hell did you run off? You left me!" Damn it again. That had slipped out. She badly wanted an answer to that, but…

"你在说什么傻话，笨蛋？" 她努力让自己的语气保持一丝锐利。她此刻比她愿意承认的更渴望将脸埋进他的胸膛，暂时隔绝世界，享受那份她渴望的拥抱。但如果他是在寻求她的帮助，那么她依赖他也许并不合时宜。该死。"还有，你他妈为什么要跑掉？你丢下我了！" 该死，这话脱口而出。她迫切想要一个答案，但……

Shinji's tension and shaking had likewise eased as he held onto her. He took a steadying breath and fumbled for an answer. "I ran off because…" Dark, anguished laughter escaped him again. "Because I don't want to be my father. But I still do. I… I don't know."

当真嗣紧握着她时，他的紧张和颤抖也逐渐平息。他深吸一口气，试图寻找答案。“我逃跑是因为……”他再次发出苦涩的笑声。“因为我不想成为我父亲那样的人。但我还是想。我……我不知道。”

"Third, you had better start making sense, or I'm going to lock you in a room with geek-Stooge and have him jabber about his mecha at you until your ears bleed. What the fuck are you talking about, turning into your father? " She tried to ignore the fact her hands had left the table and come up to wrap over his, and how nice that felt.

第三，你最好开始说点有意义的话，否则我就把你关进房间，让那个极客斯图奇对着你滔滔不绝地讲他的机甲，直到你耳朵流血。你他妈到底在说什么，变成你父亲那样？”她试图忽略自己的手已经离开桌面，缠绕在他的手上，以及那种感觉有多么美好。

"We… when we were talking about Don Barceló, and what to do with him? And you said he was like the ones who hurt you? When you said that, I… I wanted to burn him."

我们……在讨论唐·巴塞洛的时候，关于如何处置他？然后你说他就像那些伤害过你的人？当你那么说的时候，我……我真想把他烧了。

Asuka let her hands drop and twisted around inside his arms to bring their faces together. She squinted at Shinji's face. Both the words and the sudden savage tone were very uncharacteristic of the pathologically quiet and violence-averse Third Child. The Shinji Ikari who'd been willing to consider surrendering to Winthrop's goons rather than possibly cause civilian casualties in Berlin now sounded eager to tie Don Barceló to a stake and light it up? But she found nothing but anger and conviction in his expression.

明日香松开双手，扭转身躯，使两人的脸庞贴近。她眯起眼睛审视着真嗣的面容。无论是言辞还是那突如其来的凶狠语气，都与那个病态般安静、极力避免暴力的第三适格者大相径庭。那个曾考虑向温斯洛的爪牙投降，以免在柏林可能造成平民伤亡的真嗣·伊卡里，如今却似乎急切地想要将唐·巴塞洛绑在火刑柱上点燃？然而，她在他脸上看到的只有愤怒与坚定。

"That is… not very like you, Shinji," she slowly.

“那可真不像你啊，真嗣。”她缓缓地说。

He shook his head slowly. "Yes, it is. That's what I found out when you said that, Asuka. He was like the people who hurt you, so I wanted to hurt him. A lot. Because of that. I should have known, after Berlin, and being his son. It all adds up… it must be in the blood." Shinji's eyes finally met hers again, and he looked… strange. "I love you, Asuka. I failed you once, you were the only thing in the world that I cared about for years, and now that you know I love you, and we're in danger... when you said that, I suddenly realized there was absolutely nothing I wouldn't do to protect you now." His voice was low and almost sorrowful now. "I'd burn down Heaven for you. Just like my father. You were right. I am going to grow up to be just like him."

他缓缓摇头。“是的，就是这样。当你那么说时，我意识到了，明日香。他就像那些伤害过你的人，所以我想要伤害他，很深。正因为如此。我早该明白，经历了柏林的事，还有作为他的儿子。这一切都串联起来了……一定是流淌在血液里。”真嗣的目光终于再次与她交汇，他的神情显得……异样。“我爱你，明日香。我曾辜负过你，多年来，你是这世上我唯一在乎的。现在你知道我爱你，而我们身处险境……当你那么说时，我突然明白，如今为了保护你，我愿意做任何事。”他的声音低沉，几乎带着哀伤。“我愿为你焚尽天堂。就像我父亲一样。你是对的。我终将成长为他那样的人。”

Asuka's mind whirled. The doormat Third Child was ready, willing, and it even sounded like dead certain that he would commit any sin or trample any opposition in the name of protecting her. Where had the old Third gone? Growing up into Gendo Ikari's son after all? And now he was… afraid of that, more than before? He needed her? "You… and you want me to keep you from being your father?"

明日香的思绪一片混乱。那个被称为第三适格者的少年，如今不仅准备就绪、心甘情愿，甚至听起来像是铁了心要为了保护她而不惜犯下任何罪行，践踏一切阻碍。曾经的那个他去了哪里？终究还是成长为了碇源堂的儿子吗？而现在，他竟然……比以往更加害怕这一点？他需要她？“你……你是想让我阻止你成为你父亲那样的人吗？”

Shinji nodded and a weak smile grew on his face. "I should have bet you'd get it right away. You…yes. I love you. You're brilliant. I think I might act like my father, and lose all sense of restraint when it comes to keeping you from ever getting hurt again and tearing apart anyone who's ever hurt you in the past, and I know that's bad but I want to make up for the past and I'd do anything for you but I don't want to be him…"

绫波点点头，脸上浮现出一抹无力的微笑。“我早该料到你能立刻明白。你……是的，我爱你。你太出色了。我担心自己会像父亲那样，在保护你不再受伤害这件事上失去所有克制，对曾经伤害过你的人恨不得将其撕成碎片，我知道这不好，但我想要弥补过去，愿意为你做任何事，只是不愿成为他那样的人……”

Asuka put her hand over his mouth. "Shinji! Shinji! Stop it, you're babbling."

明日香用手捂住他的嘴。“真嗣！真嗣！别说了，你这是在胡言乱语。”

He blinked rapidly at her and took several more deep breaths, calming a bit. He swallowed several times before he gently removed her hand from his mouth. "I…my father was ready to destroy the world for my mother. I… feel just as strongly about you, Asuka. I want you to know that, but… I also want you to stop me if I ever do start turning into him. He was willing to do anything for her, and I know I'd do just as much for you. I don't doubt it at all. So I need you to stop me, to be my… moral anchor. Because I know I could easily do anything, any sin in the name of protecting you… and damn me, I don't want to hold back when it comes to what I feel for you. This… I should have told you years ago. Now that I have, I feel… unleashed, like I've broken free of something restraining me. I feel like I could do anything, and I don't want that to stop. I feel…free." His eyes finally lost their worried look and shifted to a much warmer gaze, locked on to her eyes. "Because of you."

他快速眨眼望着她，深呼吸了几次，稍稍平静下来。他吞咽了几次，才轻柔地移开她捂在他嘴上的手。“我……我父亲曾为了我母亲不惜毁灭世界。我……对你也有同样强烈的感情，飞鸟。我希望你知道这一点，但……如果我真开始变得像他，我也希望你能阻止我。他愿意为她做任何事，我知道我也会为你做到同样的地步。对此我毫不怀疑。所以我需要你阻止我，成为我的……道德锚点。因为我知道，为了保护你，我可能轻易做出任何事，犯下任何罪行……而我，该死地，不想在对你感情上有所保留。这……我早该在多年前告诉你。现在说出来了，我感觉……释放了，像是打破了束缚我的枷锁。我觉得我可以做任何事，我不想这种感觉停止。我感觉……自由。”他的眼神终于不再忧虑，转而变得温暖，紧紧锁定她的双眼。“因为你。”

It was Asuka's turn to blink. 'What the Hell?' This was not the conversation she'd expected to have with Shinji when he returned from running off like that. She'd been expecting a loud argument, more like their old days, full of shouting and anger over how much justice she could get him to agree to over Don Barceló. Not this… whatever this naked confession was. 'He needs me?' Once Asuka would have been disgusted at a declaration like that, dismissing it as weakness, like she'd rejected his plea to her during Instrumentality. Now it was not disgusting, it was terrifying. 'He's that devoted to me already, willing to do anything for me, even to become his father, someone he hates more than anyone else in the world? Am I… do I even deserve that?'

轮到明日香眨眼了。'这到底是什么鬼？'这并非她预想中与真嗣重逢后的对话。她本以为会是一场激烈的争吵，就像他们过去的那些日子，充斥着关于唐·巴塞洛问题上她能让他认同多少正义的怒吼和争执。而不是这种……无论这种赤裸裸的坦白是什么。'他需要我？'曾经的明日香会对这样的宣言感到厌恶，将其视为软弱，就像她在人类补完计划中拒绝他的恳求一样。如今，这不再令人反感，而是令人恐惧。他已如此深陷于对我的忠诚，愿意为我做任何事，甚至变成他那令他深恶痛绝的父亲？我……我配得上这样的付出吗？'

She ruthlessly crushed down the dark voices that denied it, and almost desperately seized on the remaining fragments of her anger as a means of avoiding that line of thought and its causes until she'd had time to think about it. "I told you not to give yourself away to me, Shinji. I don't want…'You have to be there for me, Third Child. You don't know how much I nee- want that.' "I want a boyfriend and a partner, not a sidekick or a dependant."

她无情地压制了那些否认的声音，近乎绝望地抓住残存的怒气，以此逃避那条思路及其缘由，直到她有时间去思考。“我告诉过你，别向我暴露自己，真嗣。我不想要……你得为我而在，第三适格者。你不知道我有多么需要——想要你。”“我想要的是男友和伴侣，而非跟班或依赖者。”

Shinji's eyes just kept getting warmer and brighter as his expression lightened. His arms tightened around her, too. "I'm not going to, Asuka. I just need you to stop me from going too far, because while I'm not quite sure who I am yet, I think I know how to get there. The philosophy is coming in handy, now. I doubt myself, everything, all the time… but not this. Not loving you. I have absolutely no doubts there at all and I never will. And I can build from that." His eyes glowed at her now. "You want a hero? I can be one. You want the Shinji who eats Angels for breakfast? That can be me. That will be me. I can do anything now. Now that I have a cause, a reason to start over new."

真嗣的眼神愈发温暖明亮，表情也变得轻松起来。他的双臂紧紧环绕着她，说道：“我不会的，明日香。我只是需要你在我走得太远时阻止我，因为尽管我还不完全确定自己是谁，但我想我知道如何到达那里。哲学现在派上用场了。我怀疑一切，无时无刻不在怀疑……但不是这个。不是爱你。对此我绝对没有丝毫疑虑，永远不会。我可以从这里开始构建。”此刻，他的目光闪烁着对她的承诺，“你想要一个英雄？我可以成为那样的人。你想要那个以天使为早餐的真嗣？那可以是我，那将会是我。现在我无所不能。既然我有了一个目标，一个重新开始的理由。”

Asuka's pulse skyrocketed back up to where it had slowly dropped back down from, and kept going. This…this was getting intense, and scary. She jerked a look over to where Ching and Sergeant Bir had been standing beside the door. They were gone. They had apparently slipped out silently while she and Shinji had been preoccupied. No one was here to witness this but she and Shinji. That only made it even more frightening. 'He can't be for real… this can't be true. This couldn't possibly happen to me…' "Shinji, I…"

明日香的脉搏再次飙升至先前缓慢回落的水平，且持续上升。这……这愈发激烈，令人恐惧。她猛地朝门口望去，原本站在那里的青和伯尔中士已不见踪影。显然，在她和真嗣专注之际，他们悄无声息地离开了。此刻，除了她和真嗣，无人见证这一切，这使得情况更加令人胆寒。他不可能来真的……这不可能是真的。这种事绝不可能发生在我身上……"真嗣，我……"

He didn't seem to hear her. He looked… happy. She'd almost never seen his face lit up like this. His eyes were positively electric, so blue... He laughed. "I… feel more than free, Asuka. I… I'm starting to feel like I did on that beach the first morning."

他似乎没有听见她的话。他看起来……很快乐。她几乎从未见过他的脸庞如此明亮。他的眼睛闪烁着电光般的蓝，如此明亮……他笑了。“我……感觉到的不仅仅是自由，明日香。我……我开始感觉像是在那个海滩上的第一个早晨。”

Asuka's heartbeat spiked, then resumed merely rabbit-fast. 'To feel like he did on the beach?' She knew exactly what beach he meant. Not the blood red one in the twilight after the end of the world they'd once woken on. He meant the dawn-lit one where she'd felt happy for the first time in years, where she'd felt like she was soaring, looking into his eyes. She knew very well just how badly she wanted that feeling back, and for it to go on forever. If that was how this confession was making him feel, she knew exactly how much he wanted it too, because there was almost nothing she wouldn't do to get that feeling back. '…with him? Please?,' whispered a very, very quiet voice far in the back.

明日香的脉搏骤然加速，随后又恢复到仅如兔子般急促。'感受到他在海滩上的那种心情？'她完全明白他指的是哪片海滩。并非那片末日黄昏后血红色的沙滩，他们曾在那里醒来。他指的是那片晨曦照耀下的海滩，她在那里多年后首次感受到幸福，仿佛翱翔于天际，凝视着他的双眼。她深知自己多么渴望重获那种感觉，并让它永恒延续。如果这份告白让他感受到同样的渴望，她清楚他对此的渴望有多深，因为她几乎愿意做任何事来重拾那份感觉。'……和他一起？求你了？'一个极其微弱的声音在内心深处低语。

That voice became a spark she used to push back against the fear and paralyzing uncertainty. 'No. No question marks. With him. He's mine. I claimed him, and he swore. He's going to be right where I want him until I say otherwise. I told him to push back, and he has. Can I do any less? I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, damn it! I will not lose to the Third Child! And no Wondergirl, Dons, or my own terrors are going to stop me.' So now what, then? Asuka hesitated for a second, controlling the fear with will. This was way too much to process right now. She needed time to think about it all. So in the absence of any other plans (and, importantly, no audience she still wasn't really ready to do this in front of), Asuka went with her usual tactic; offense. She snaked her own arms around him and pulled him tightly against her, looking right into his eyes with their faces inches apart.

那声音成了她用来抵抗恐惧和瘫痪的不确定性的火花。不，没有问号。和他一起。他是我的。我宣称了他，他发誓了。他会一直在我想要他的地方，直到我说不。我告诉他要反击，他也做到了。我能做得更少吗？我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，该死！我不会输给第三适格者！无论是 Wondergirl、Dons，还是我自己的恐惧，都无法阻止我。'那么现在怎么办？明日香犹豫了一秒，用意志控制住恐惧。现在要处理的事情太多了。她需要时间来思考这一切。在没有其他计划的情况下（更重要的是，没有她还没准备好面对的观众），明日香采取了惯用的策略：进攻。她伸出自己的手臂环绕住他，紧紧地将他拉向自己，脸庞相隔仅几英寸，直视他的眼睛。

"Alright, Shinji. I'm going to hold you to that. You're going to become the Great Invincible Shinji-sama for real, and I'm going to keep you from turning into your dad. We'll tell Ching to let Don Asshole suffer for a while, then give him a nice clean hanging along with any of his men like him. And you will be explaining yourself to me tonight, along with an extensive massage to apologize for making me worry by running off. Deal?" she breathed right against his mouth. She waited only as long as it took for him to blink and give a small nod before mashing her lips against his. His answering vigor made her breath come even faster. Yes, thinking could wait.

好吧，真嗣。我会让你遵守承诺的。你要成为真正的大无敌真嗣大人，而我则会阻止你变成你父亲那样。我们会告诉青，让那个混蛋唐受点苦，然后给他一个干净利落的绞刑，连同他的那些同伙一起。而你今晚得向我解释清楚，还得给我做个长长的按摩，以补偿你让我担心而跑掉的事。成交？" 她贴着他的嘴唇轻声说道。她只等他眨眼并微微点头，便猛地吻了上去。他热烈的回应让她的呼吸更加急促。是的，思考可以等一等。

art 55 第五十五章

Feelings and First Missions

情感与首次任务

.

Hours later, thinking had eventually resumed, but Asuka was still far from any sure conclusions. Shinji's confession of love for and now devotion to her had her mental wheels fighting for traction, as well as a good amount of effort at steadfastly containing the fearful whimper that denied she was worthy of receiving any such words. Asuka grimaced. While her rekindled sense of self and formidable will were holding the dark voices at bay, she was having far less success at making any sort of progress on the other side of things. 'So just what do I want, here? I had demanded unconditional closeness and affection from the Third, and he gave it. I 'surrendered' to him, more out of fatigue than any real feeling, or at least I thought. And now he's declared he loves me and is willing to do anything for me, up to and including turning into his father, unless I say the word to hold him back. I have Mama and my friends back, a brand new hot rod mecha, and even a starring role in another fight, this time with allies and a decent cause, too. Theoretically, I have everything I ever wanted. So why do I feel hollow and adrift? What do I really want? What do I feel about him?' Her eyes slid again to the comm window in Red Whirlwind's screen. Shinji met her eyes briefly with the kind of steady look she expected from him in the cockpit, and returned to watching the outside world skim past as they flew south. They'd said little to each other the whole flight, Shinji clearly sensing her need to be alone with her thoughts through the mecha's link. His own just as clear warm mental embrace back at her had been both welcome and added further fuel to her confusion.

数小时后，思绪终于重新运转，但明日香仍未得出确切结论。真嗣对她的爱慕与如今矢志不渝的承诺，让她的心绪如同车轮在泥泞中挣扎，同时还要努力抑制那因自认不配承受如此情话而生的恐惧呜咽。明日香皱起眉头。尽管重燃的自我意识与坚强的意志力将那些阴暗的声音拒之门外，她在处理另一面的事情上却进展甚微。'那么，我到底想要什么？我曾向第三要求无条件的亲近与爱意，而他给予了。我'屈服'于他，更多是出于疲惫而非真实情感，至少我是这么认为的。现在他宣称爱我，愿意为我做任何事，甚至不惜变成他父亲那样，除非我开口阻止。我找回了母亲和朋友，拥有了一台崭新的强力机甲，甚至再次成为战斗的主角，这次还有盟友和正当的理由。理论上，我已拥有所有曾经渴望的一切。那为何我仍感到空虚和迷茫？我真正想要的是什么？我对他的感觉又是如何？她的目光再次滑向红旋风屏幕上的通讯窗口。真嗣短暂地与她对视，驾驶舱中那种她所期待的坚定眼神一闪而过，随后又转回去，注视着他们向南飞行时掠过的外界景象。整个飞行过程中，他们几乎没有交谈，真嗣显然通过机甲的链接感受到了她想要独自沉浸在思绪中的需求。他那清晰而温暖的思维拥抱回应，既让她感到欣慰，又进一步加剧了她的困惑。

She'd spent years not thinking about the Third Child in any way save to be angry at him. Anything else hurt too much. She'd become quite expert at avoiding thinking of him in any of a number of more painful ways, like what they might have been to each other if they'd just talked, or the kinds of looks he used to give her when he thought she couldn't see. Now...now she couldn't keep those thoughts from her mind. He was reaching out to her...but she had no idea how to respond. Pushing him into an active response like last night worked for a stopgap (and oh, were the results nice), but to move forward she had to figure out where she stood herself. What was he to her? And a much more troubling question, what was she to him? She'd called him her 'boyfriend', even her 'lover', and he'd glowed in response, but how would she react if he said something like that of her?

多年来，她除了对他感到愤怒外，从未以任何方式思考过第三子。其他任何想法都太过痛苦。她已变得相当擅长避免以任何更痛苦的方式想起他，比如如果他们只是交谈过，他们之间可能会是什么关系，或者当他以为她看不见时，他曾经给她的那种眼神。现在……现在她无法阻止这些思绪涌入脑海。他在向她伸出援手……但她不知道该如何回应。像昨晚那样迫使他做出积极回应可以作为一种权宜之计（哦，结果是多么美好），但要向前迈进，她必须弄清楚自己的立场。他对于她来说是什么？而一个更令人困扰的问题是，她对他来说又是什么？她曾称他为她的“男朋友”，甚至是她的“爱人”，他对此感到欣喜，但如果他这样形容她，她又会作何反应呢？

She'd been so tired before the coup in Berlin. Tired of having to keep up her mask of fearless arrogance, tired of the endless parade of nightmares and tear-soaked pillows that ruled her nights, tired of worrying every day that Winthrop or BABYKA had finally decided she was a security threat or problem they no longer wanted to deal with and were coming to finish off what the Mass Production series had begun. The Third Child arriving in Berlin after years of being separated had been a painful reminder of better days. Jinnai showing her the video of her mother being condemned to die again had been too much additional pain to bear. A few moments of water in her lungs in the bath, and she'd stop hurting and being afraid forever...

政变前的柏林，她已疲惫至极。厌倦了维持那副无所畏惧的傲慢面具，厌倦了夜夜噩梦连连、泪湿枕巾的折磨，厌倦了日复一日担忧温斯罗普或 BABYKA 最终认定她为不再愿处理的安全威胁或问题，从而来终结“量产系列”未竟之事。与阔别多年的第三子在柏林重逢，成了对往昔美好时光的痛楚提醒。而神无展现给她母亲再次被判死刑的视频，更是雪上加霜，痛彻心扉。只需在浴缸中让水灌入肺部片刻，她便能永远摆脱痛苦与恐惧……

And Shinji had stopped her. Somehow he'd known, and stopped her before she could finally end it all. She lashed out hard at him afterward, for making her go on hurting and fearing. She'd wanted to hurt him badly, so he'd know the kind of pain his actions were forcing her to keep living with. She knew she'd succeeded, too. The flash of pain in his eyes had been nearly as sharp as the one she'd similarly inflicted on him in the depths of Instrumentality. He'd left that stupid note and been ready to surrender to BABYKA, taking the martyr's way out again, leaving her again... Or so she'd thought. Daniel had said Shinji really intended to fight and had left the note as insurance that he thought would leave her blameless, as though it would have fooled anyone. He'd been ready to die for her, rather than see her die. She'd gotten him to get moving again when he balked at fighting in the city with the same threat; if he didn't, she'd die. Instrumentality had shown her the same thing; Shinji would rather die than live in a world without her.

而真嗣阻止了她。不知怎的，他预感到了，并在她彻底终结一切之前阻止了她。事后，她狠狠地反击了他，因为他让她继续承受痛苦和恐惧。她想要让他深刻体会到，他的行为迫使她继续活下去的那种痛苦。她知道自己成功了，他眼中的痛苦闪现，几乎和她曾在人类补完计划深处给予他的那一击一样尖锐。他留下了那张愚蠢的便条，准备向 BABYKA 投降，再次选择殉道者的道路，再次离她而去……至少她是这么认为的。丹尼尔说真嗣其实打算战斗，留下那张便条是为了确保她无罪，仿佛这能骗过任何人。他宁愿为她而死，也不愿看到她死去。当他在城市中犹豫是否战斗时，她用同样的威胁让他重新行动起来；如果他不战斗，她就会死。人类补完计划也向她展示了同样的事实；真嗣宁愿死去，也不愿活在一个没有她的世界里。

Things had hardly improved much after the coup. Even getting to put an entire pistol magazine of bullets through Winthrop's head had barely lessened her heartache. It hadn't brought Mama back, and she could feel all too well how fragile her arrangement with the Third had been. She'd tried offering sex, both as a desperate attempt to keep him with her, and just to have someone want to hold her, even so briefly. But he'd stopped after barely beginning. Even he didn't want her. Except he did; he'd said so when she finally asked, and ohGott had he shown it the last two nights. A grin clawed its way onto her face as she thought that last part over. He looked at her and touched her like she was a priceless china work of art, and his eyes absolutely burned when they met hers. She had to admit, at least to herself, that the mind-bendingly good sex was not the smallest reason she wanted Shinji to stay with her. Two nights had been great, but he owed her years of that, damn it.

政变之后，情况并未有太多改善。即便将一整匣子弹射入温思罗普的脑袋，也未能减轻她内心的痛苦。母亲无法因此复活，她深知与第三方的协议是多么脆弱。她曾试图以性作为手段，既是绝望地想留住他，也是渴望有人哪怕短暂地拥抱自己。然而，他刚一接触便戛然而止。连他也不想要她了。可事实并非如此；当她终于开口询问时，他承认了，而且过去两晚的表现更是淋漓尽致。想到这里，她的嘴角不由自主地勾起一抹笑意。他看她、触碰她，仿佛她是无价之宝的瓷器艺术品，目光交汇时，他的眼神炽热如火。她不得不承认，至少对自己承认，那令人神魂颠倒的性爱绝非她希望真嗣留下的最微不足道的理由。两晚虽美妙，但他欠她的，是数年的陪伴，该死的。

Her grin faded. He owed her? Mount Asama, the bath in Berlin, carrying her through the fighting in NERV Berlin while she was gutshot...she owed him just as much, if not far more, and she knew it. Yet that was why his failure to come to her aid against the MP Evas had bit so deep, even beyond the physical pain of the combat itself. Every other time, he'd been there for her. But then, when the stakes were highest and her need the greatest, he'd folded, crumpling into a weepy mess on the catwalk overlooking Eva Unit-01. And she'd died fighting alone, even her impossible, whirlwind victory snatched away by the MP Evas' S2 engines and regeneration.

她的笑容消失了。他欠她的？浅间山，柏林的浴室，在 NERV 柏林的战斗中，她腹部中弹时他背着她……她欠他的，如果不是更多，至少也是同样多，她心知肚明。然而，这正是为什么他在对抗 MP 使徒时未能援助她，那痛苦之深，甚至超越了战斗本身的肉体痛苦。每一次，他都曾站在她这边。但就在赌注最高、她最需要他的时候，他却崩溃了，在俯瞰 EVA 初号机的走道上泣不成声。而她孤身奋战至死，连那不可能的、旋风般的胜利也被 MP 使徒的 S2 引擎和再生能力夺走。

The pain of that singular failure and betrayal still left her so angry at him. She had been telling the truth when she told him last night that she still hated him. 'Yet that was the very first thing he thought of when I demanded he apologize for something. And he's sworn himself to make it up to me or die trying at my side until I say I'm satisfied. Gaaahhh...' Asuka wished she'd gotten a chance to talk to Hikari this morning. Circumstance had thwarted her.

那次独特的失败与背叛带来的痛苦仍让她对他怒火中烧。昨晚她告诉他，她依然恨他，这话是真心的。然而，当我要求他道歉时，这却是他首先想到的事情。他发誓要弥补我，或者在我身边努力至死，直到我说我满意为止。啊啊啊……' 明日香希望今早有机会和光谈谈。但情况却让她未能如愿。

After a long and enjoyable moment to 'seal the deal', it had finally occurred to Asuka to wonder where Ching and Sergeant Bir had gotten to. They turned up just outside the command pit's room, quietly having their own conversation. When Asuka came out, Ching was snickering at an embarrassed-looking Sergeant Bir for being an 'Imperial fanboy', whatever that was. Asuka had asked her where Hikari was resting, hoping to catch her friend before things got moving for the day. She'd dragged Shinji along behind her, more reluctant than ever to have him outside of her reach.

经过一段漫长而愉快的“敲定交易”时刻后，明日香终于想起要问问青和伯尔中士去了哪里。他们就在指挥坑室外的角落里，正悄悄地交谈着。当明日香走出来时，青正对着一脸尴尬的伯尔中士窃笑，戏称他为“帝国迷弟”，尽管明日香并不清楚那是什么意思。她询问了光休息的地方，希望能赶在当天事务开始前见到好友。她拖着真嗣跟在身后，比以往任何时候都更不愿让他离开自己的视线。

A bit of walking had found Hikari's room in one of the other buildings in the complex around the stadium. But just before they'd made it to her door, they'd halted on hearing voices inside already quietly talking. Asuka had peeked around the door jamb to see Touji already at Hikari's bedside, stroking her hand as they talked.

在体育场周围的综合建筑群中，一段步行后，他们找到了光所在的房间。然而，就在他们即将到达她的门前时，听到里面已经有人在低声交谈，于是停下了脚步。明日香悄悄探头望向门框，只见东治已经在光的床边，轻抚着她的手，两人正交谈着。

"…Kaji-san was amazing. He kept everyone together, made sure I had all the supplies I needed. He and Lieutenant O'Brien got all of the women who could still walk on their own out of there as we arrived and brought them and the… more hurt ones here after I stabilized them. I… I just knew what to do." Hikari's voice was a bit shaky, but she kept talking to Touji in a low tone. "It's like my hands were working on their own. It… its good, too, because if I let myself think about how they got some of those injuries… Touji, I… There was a dungeon in that place! It was like something out of medieval times! And, and…some of the women said they'd been there for months, and that things like this had been going on since right after the Third Impact!"

……卡吉先生太厉害了。他让大家团结一致，确保我拥有所需的一切物资。他和奥布赖恩中尉在我们到达时，将那些还能自己行走的女性全部救出，并在我稳定她们伤势后，把她们和……更严重的伤者带到了这里。我……我只是知道该怎么做。”光的声音有些颤抖，但她仍低声向冬二倾诉，“仿佛我的双手自己在行动。这……这样也好，因为如果我让自己去想她们是如何受的那些伤……冬二，我……那里有个地牢！就像中世纪的东西！而且，而且……有些女性说她们已经被关了几个月，自从第三次冲击后，这种事情就一直发生！

Touji had sounded stunned. "But… but… Shinji and the Red Demon lived through it, for four years, right? Why… why haven't they said anything?"

冬二听起来很震惊。“但是……但是……真嗣和红魔不是活过了那四年吗？为什么……为什么他们什么都没说？”

"I tried to ask Asuka about it last night at the ball, but she looked at me without saying anything for a long time, then just said 'It was bad'. She refused to say anything else." Hikari had said softly. "What sort of Hell have they lived through? Stuff so bad she doesn't even want to talk to her best friend about it?"

“昨晚在舞会上，我试图向明日香询问这件事，但她长时间地看着我，一言不发，最后只说了句‘那很糟糕’。她拒绝再说任何其他的话。”光轻声说道。“他们究竟经历了怎样的地狱？糟糕到连她都不愿向最好的朋友提起？”

"Maybe it's somethin' too ugly for them to talk about because they don't want us to pity them, or it hurts to talk about. Maybe they just don't want to share that sort of pain with us. We've come out of the past to their eyes. Maybe that was a happier time, and they don't want to pile the horrors they saw on us. Maybe we'll need to lean on them after we've seen some of it ourselves. All we can do is still be their friends, and help where we can. If they want to talk about it with us, they can," Touji had said gently. Despite her and Shinji being out of sight in the hall, Asuka could practically hear the look of surprise Hikari gave her new boyfriend for his surprisingly insightful statement.

“或许那是他们难以启齿的丑陋之事，因为不想我们同情，或谈及便痛彻心扉。或许他们只是不愿与我们分享那种痛苦。在他们眼中，我们来自过去。那或许是更快乐的时光，他们不愿将所见的恐怖加诸于我们。或许当我们亲历一些后，会需要依靠他们。我们能做的，仍是作为朋友，尽我们所能去帮助。若他们愿意向我们倾诉，自然会开口，”东治温和地说道。尽管她和真嗣在走廊里已不见踪影，明日香几乎能感受到光对新男友这番出乎意料的深刻见解所流露的惊讶。

There had been a pause, then Hikari had quietly replied, "A while back, Asuka asked me what I saw in you. I told her it was your compassion. I'm so glad I've finally got you, Touji. I think… I'm really glad you're here now." The sounds of an embrace and kisses had followed, and Asuka had judged it time to withdraw. She'd have to try talking to Hikari later.

短暂的沉默后，光轻声回应道：“不久前，明日香问我看中了你什么。我告诉她是你的同情心。终于能拥有你，东治，我真的很高兴。我想……此刻你在这里，我真的很欣慰。”随后是拥抱与亲吻的声音，明日香判断此时应悄然离开。她得另找机会和光谈谈了。

They'd ended up just walking around the stadium complex hand in hand, talking to each other. She'd told him the details of her mission with Daniel the first day after their arrival, how she'd rescued Misato's father and Kaji's brother. He'd talked, with growing confidence, about his worries about acting just like his father, and how he had trust in her to keep him from going too far. She'd said little during that part, confusion still swirling in her head.

他们最终只是手牵手在体育场综合区里漫步，彼此交谈。她向他讲述了抵达后第一天与丹尼尔执行任务的细节，如何救出了美里父亲和卡吉的兄弟。他则越来越自信地谈起自己对变得像父亲一样的担忧，以及他相信她能防止他走得太远。在那部分谈话中，她几乎没说什么，心中仍是一片困惑。

That confusion had persisted for the morning, until a call for them had come from Ching in the command pit. The patrol of Scouts under Misato sent to establish control in La Plata, southeast of Buenos Aires itself, had run into a remnant force of Don Barceló's men, with some armored personnel carriers. Rather than try to subdue them with force of arms, Misato had judged it a good time to call in her Pilots for a show of force.

混乱持续了整个上午，直到从指挥坑传来青的召唤。由美里派遣前往拉普拉塔建立控制的侦察队，在布宜诺斯艾利斯东南部遭遇了唐·巴塞洛手下的一支残余部队，携带着几辆装甲运兵车。美里判断，与其试图用武力制服他们，不如召集她的飞行员们展示实力。

Asuka had been only too happy to have an actual mission to focus on, and she'd dragged Shinji into Red Whirlwind and launched as quickly as she could. Which had led to her current position, zooming southeastward over the city, still unsure of what she wanted and felt. She shoved those thoughts aside and wrapped her hands back around the joysticks, signaling Shinji with a mental nudge that she was resuming control. She felt his answering nod through the link, along with something that felt like squeezing her hand.

明日香一直非常乐意有实际任务来集中精力，她迅速拉着真嗣加入红色旋风并尽快启动。这导致她现在正朝着东南方向疾驰在城市上空，内心仍不确定自己的愿望和感受。她将这些思绪推到一边，重新握紧操纵杆，用心灵感应轻触真嗣，表示她要重新掌控。她通过链接感受到他回应的点头，以及一种仿佛握住她手的触感。

'Damn it, Third, right now your little gestures of affection are only adding to my trouble thinking. Don't you dare stop, though. Ever.' She was glad that the link through the mecha only seemed to carry thoughts she actually pushed through it. Shinji getting to listen in on her thinking right now was a level of intimacy she was far from prepared to handle just yet.

该死，三号，你此刻的小小爱抚只让我思绪更乱。但你可别停，永远别停。' 她庆幸通过机甲的连接似乎只传递了她主动推送的想法。真嗣此刻若能听到她的心声，那将是她远未准备好面对的亲密程度。

Shaking her head, she tapped a new comm window open and called Misato. "Hey, Misato, we're here. We'll be overhead in a minute. What's our lineup?"

她摇了摇头，打开一个新的通讯窗口，呼叫了美里。“嘿，美里，我们到了。一分钟内就会在上空。我们的阵容是什么？”

Their former roommate and Ops boss gave her a grim smile. "We've got at least dozen armored vehicles in front of us with some supporting infantry. Give them a close flyover with your big red machine, and we'll call on them to surrender. If they don't, you can hit them with your flechette cannon, and see what that does. Sending coordinates of their position now."

他们以前的室友兼行动负责人向她露出了一个冷酷的微笑。“我们面前至少有十几辆装甲车，还有些步兵支援。你驾驶那架红色巨机低空飞越他们，我们就向他们发出投降的最后通牒。如果他们不从，你就用你的飞镖炮轰击，看看效果如何。现在发送他们的坐标给你。”

Asuka smiled. Red Whirlwind had its usual gigantic plasma cannon replaced with a neural-induction flechette pod for this campaign. It fired thousands of independently-tracking needle-sized projectiles at a shot, each one able to deliver a specific electrical jolt to its target. It was perfect for their 'Nobody Dies' parameters; each flechette was capable of tuning its electric shock from 'mild discomfort' to 'pain to unconscious' to 'completely dead'. While it was not so great as anything but an anti-personnel weapon, it was perfect for keeping casualties to a minimum. Strafing a group of Don Barceló's troops would be a breeze. She set the pod for 'pain to unconsciousness' and made sure to reduce the speed of the pulse so the affected targets would have time to scream first. She just wanted to maximize the psychological effect, really.

明日香微笑着。这次行动中，红旋风机甲将其惯用的巨型等离子炮替换为了神经感应飞镖发射器。该发射器一次可发射数千枚独立追踪的针状弹丸，每一枚都能向目标传递特定的电击。这完美契合了他们的“无人死亡”参数；每枚飞镖都能调节其电击强度，从“轻微不适”到“痛苦至昏迷”再到“彻底死亡”。尽管它作为反人员武器之外并不出色，但对于将伤亡降至最低却恰到好处。扫射唐·巴塞洛的部队将轻而易举。她将发射器设定为“痛苦至昏迷”，并特意减缓脉冲速度，确保受击目标有足够时间先发出尖叫。她只是想最大化心理效应而已。

She took their first pass over the target coordinates low and slow in humanoid-mode, knowing there was precious little on this entire planet that could even scratch Red Whirlwind's shields. The sight of the one hundred meter tall mecha appearing over the treeline certainly gave their opposition pause. Machine gun and autocannon fire from the APCs darted up from the enemy line after a moment of stunned disbelief, but even the small portion that actually managed to impact their shields deflected off without doing any harm. Asuka snorted contemptuously. She took another few slow passes over their line, and drifted to a halt in front of them, slightly ahead of Misato's position. She fired up the external speakers and took a deep breath. English seemed a safe bet. "EVERYONE IN FRONT OF ME BETTER SURRENDER IN THE NEXT THIRTY SECONDS, OR I'M GOING TO BLOW A NEW CRATER IN THIS LITTLE PLANET."

她以人形模式低速掠过目标坐标，深知这颗星球上鲜有能撼动“红色旋风”护盾的存在。当这百米高的机甲现身于树梢之上，无疑令对手一时愕然。片刻震惊后，敌方的装甲运兵车开始喷吐机枪与自动炮火，然而即便有零星弹雨触及护盾，也不过徒劳无功地反弹开来。明日香轻蔑地哼了一声，又几次缓缓掠过敌阵，最终停在对方前方，稍稍领先于美里所在位置。她启动外部扬声器，深吸一口气，英语应是稳妥之选：“我面前诸位，三十秒内最好投降，否则我将在这小星球上炸出个新坑。”

She saw at least half of the vehicles' hatches popping open and the crews running for the hills or just throwing themselves flat on the ground. The five remaining trained their guns on her and fired again. She laughed and mentally sketched out her plan to Shinji. She felt his agreement, and together they slid the mecha forward to pick up the one in the center with their hand. They lifted it up to Red Whirlwind's eye level, and turned it upside-down, one hundred meters in the air. It stopped futilely firing it's autocannon at her once she had it turned over. "DO YOU WANT TO SURRENDER NOW, OR SHALL WE SEE HOW FAR I CAN PUNT THIS THING?" Asuka dryly asked over the speakers. After a moment, a hand with a white handkerchief emerged from the commanders hatch and wagged it back and forth.

她目睹至少半数战车的舱门弹开，乘员们或奔向山丘，或直接扑倒在地。剩余五辆则将炮口对准她再次开火。她嗤笑一声，心中与真嗣共同勾勒出计划。感受到他的赞同，两人操控着机甲向前滑行，伸手抓住中央那辆，将其举至红色旋风视线高度，倒悬于百米高空。一旦被翻转，它便停止了徒劳的自动炮射击。“现在投降，还是想看看我能把这玩意儿踢多远？”明日香透过扬声器冷冷问道。片刻后，指挥官舱口伸出一支挥舞白旗的手。

"Damn. They're surrendering already. I didn't even get a chance to try out the flechette cannon," Asuka mock-pouted. She still grinned widely as the rest of the force in front of them likewise abandoned their vehicles.

"该死，他们这就投降了。我连飞镖炮都没机会试一试。" 明日香假装撅嘴说道。尽管如此，她还是满脸笑容地看着前方其余的敌军也纷纷弃车投降。

Shinji rolled his eyes at her in the comm window. "Oh no, you didn't get to try out your new toys. Are you turning into Kensuke? What happened to 'clean, elegant, and without waste', oh great warrior?"

真嗣在通讯窗口中对她翻了个白眼。“哦不，你没能试试你的新玩具。你这是要变成健介吗？那个‘干净、优雅、不浪费’的伟大战士怎么了？”

"Oh, stuff it, Third. We won, and with no casualties, just like you wanted. I'll get to play with all the things this baby can do next time or something." She sighed. "I just wanted my new debut battle to be a bit more flashy than hopping around Berlin on one leg or getting pile-drivered headfirst into the dirt by Israfel. This was too easy."

“哦，得了吧，第三。我们赢了，而且没有伤亡，正如你所愿。下次我就能玩转这宝贝的各种功能了，或者别的什么。”她叹了口气，“我只是希望我的新首战能比单脚跳跃在柏林或是被伊斯拉斐尔头朝下猛击进土里更炫酷一些。这次太轻松了。”

"Oh, now you've done it. Next time it will be Godzilla because you said that. I know how these movies work," Shinji dryly commented.

“哦，这下你可闯祸了。下次肯定是哥斯拉，就因为你这么说了。我了解这些电影的套路。” 真嗣干巴巴地评论道。

Asuka snorted. "After the Angels, we'll make short work of that cupcake."

明日香哼了一声。“搞定使徒之后，我们很快就能收拾掉那个小甜心。”

### Chapter 30 How You Know - Holding The Line

Shinji sat high in the upper stands of the Monumental Stadium and stared at Eva Unit-01, deep in thought. Meditating on the titanic cyborg he had once been the Pilot for was oddly soothing, the endless stare of Unit-01's blank eyes easier to meet than his father's dead gaze or the fiery, fury-filled glare a certain redhead used to hit him with. Considering that Unit-01 had held his mother's soul for most of his life put it in a different light, especially now that she was freed from it. It was still the chariot he had ridden in through some of the worst moments of his life, though, which kept it a figure of peculiar horror even with the rest in mind.

真嗣坐在纪念碑体育场的上层看台上，深思地凝视着 Eva 初号机。沉思于这台他曾驾驶过的巨型机甲，竟有种奇异的抚慰感，初号机空洞的双眼比父亲冷漠的目光或是某位红发少女充满怒火的瞪视更容易面对。考虑到初号机在他生命的大部分时间里承载着他母亲的灵魂，如今她已从中解脱，这让他对它有了不同的看法。尽管如此，它仍是真嗣在生命中最糟糕时刻所驾驭的战车，这使得它即便在其他思绪中，仍是一个特别的恐怖象征。

Hikari had pounced on them as soon as they'd returned from their mission, dragging Asuka away for 'girl talk' as she'd put it. At loose ends, Shinji had made his way to the upper deck of the stadium, now cleared of their crowd of prisoners, relocated to a more secure building in the sports complex, in search of a quiet place to sit and think. Today had been far too filled with things he really wanted to mull over already, and it wasn't even noon. He'd settled into one of the highest rows of seats and tried to put his thoughts in order.

光一回来就扑向了他们，拉着明日香去进行所谓的“女孩谈话”。无所事事的真嗣便走向体育馆的上层甲板，那里的人群已被转移到体育中心内一个更安全的建筑中，他寻找一个安静的地方坐下思考。今天的事情实在太多，他急需好好思索，而此时连中午都还没到。他找了个最高处的座位坐下，试图整理自己的思绪。

Asuka still, quite justifiably, hated him. He had failed her in a way that cost her her life, but still left her able to bitterly hold it against him afterward. And yet she was also adamant about him not leaving her side or her bed, and seemed very pleased to hear him say he loved her. She wanted him to hold her. She wanted him to stop apologizing for everything. She wanted him to truly make up for his monumental failure to come to her aid when she most needed him. She wanted him to be a hero. She… just plain wanted him? That was hard to really believe, the idea that as far back as that first kiss, she'd wanted him to be with her, wanted him that way. If only he'd… "Gods, I'm such a coward. I should have known. I felt it for her. Why didn't I see it?" Unit-01 did not answer.

明日香依然，相当有理由地，憎恨着他。他以一种让她失去生命却又让她能痛苦地对此耿耿于怀的方式辜负了她。然而，她又坚决要求他不离她左右，不离她的床榻，听到他说爱她时显得非常高兴。她希望他拥抱她。她希望他停止为一切道歉。她希望他真正弥补那次在她最需要帮助时未能伸出援手的巨大失败。她希望他成为英雄。她……只是单纯地想要他？这真的很难相信，从那个初吻开始，她就希望他陪伴在身边，以那种方式想要他。如果他当初……“天啊，我真是个懦夫。我早该明白。我对她有感觉。为什么我没看出来？”初号机没有回应。

To add to his troubles, he now had to face the ugly truth that he was much more like his father than he had ever expected. He knew, with a certainty he'd never had for anything else in his life, that he was ready and able to do anything for Asuka. Just like his father would and had done for his mother. He shuddered to think that it was not very farfetched that he might one day do or order something as terrible as his father had done to him and the other Pilots, something as hideous as ordering the Dummy Plug activated against the 13th Angel, and not hesitate for a second, because it was for her. That facet was both terrifying and exhilarating, to know he truly cared for her, without any reservations or doubts. He'd never had anything in his entire life he hadn't doubted, until this. It was crazy. "'Love is a temporary madness', Shakespeare said. I guess he was right," Shinji muttered into the breeze.

更令他烦恼的是，他不得不面对一个丑陋的真相：他比自己预想的更像他的父亲。他确信无疑，这是他一生中对任何事物都未曾有过的坚定，他已准备好并有能力为明日香做任何事。正如他父亲会做且已经为他母亲所做的那样。他战栗地想到，有朝一日他可能会像父亲对他和其他驾驶员所做的那样，下达或命令执行某种可怕的事情，比如命令激活对抗第十三使徒的傀儡插头，并且毫不犹豫，只因这一切都是为了她。这种认知既令人恐惧又令人振奋，他真心在乎她，毫无保留，毫无怀疑。他一生中从未对任何事物不曾怀疑，直到此刻。这太疯狂了。“爱情是一种暂时的疯狂，”莎士比亚曾说。“我想他是对的，”真嗣对着微风喃喃自语。

"Who was right?" Shinji blinked out of his fugue as Touji came up the steps to join him. "Yo, Shinji. Talkin' to yourself?"

"谁是对的？" 真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，此时，东治走上台阶来与他汇合。"哟，真嗣。在自言自语吗？"

Shinji suppressed a twinge of lingering guilt, but smiled at the fact his friend was walking up on two perfectly good legs. "Hey, Touji. Yeah, trying to figure some things out. Love, madness, the usual. I was quoting Shakespeare."

真嗣压下心头残留的一丝愧疚，但看到朋友用两条完好的腿走过来，还是露出了微笑。“嘿，东治。是啊，我在琢磨些事情。爱情，疯狂，老生常谈了。我刚引用了莎士比亚的话。”

His friend took a seat next to him and joined him in staring at the Evangelion. "Hikari's still havin' her girl talk with the Red Demon, and they both told me to take my testosterone and get lost for a while. I figured you could use the company if Asuka was wrapped up in that." Touji fidgeted nervously. "And… and there was a question I wanted to ask you, especially if you're thinkin' about love and madness and stuff."

他的朋友在他旁边坐下，与他一同凝视着福音战士。“光还在和红魔女聊女生话题，她们俩都让我带着我的荷尔蒙暂时消失一会儿。我想如果你被明日香缠住了，可能会需要人陪。”东治紧张地扭动着。“而且……而且我有个问题想问你，特别是如果你在思考关于爱情和疯狂之类的事情。”

Shinji regarded Touji with a sidelong look and a sad half-smile. "I'm hardly any kind of expert on love. Maybe on madness."

真嗣侧目看着东治，带着一丝苦笑。“我对爱情几乎一无所知。或许对疯狂还有点了解。”

"Madness ain't what I want to ask you about, man. It's the other stuff," Touji said. "Tho' I think they gotta be pretty close together. You and the Red Demon? I mean, even in school I could tell you two had something going on between ya, but the real thing?" He shook his head. "Yer a braver man than I, mister Ikari, to play with fire like that."

"疯狂不是我想问你的，伙计。是其他的事，"东治说。"虽然我觉得这两者应该挺接近的。你和红魔？我是说，即使在上学时我就能看出你们俩之间有点什么，但真的吗？"他摇了摇头。"你比我勇敢，碇先生，敢那样玩火。"

Shinji snorted. "More crazy than brave there, I think. And… it's a good kind of crazy. I can make something of it, make something of myself."

真嗣哼了一声。“与其说是勇敢，不如说是疯狂。而且……这是一种好的疯狂。我能从中创造出什么，也能塑造自己。”

Touji looked at him with a little surprise. Shinji had sounded much more sure of himself than the athletic boy was used to hearing. "You uh….you sound pretty happy about the crazy part."

冬二略带惊讶地看着他。真嗣的声音听起来比这位运动型男孩习惯听到的要自信得多。“你，呃……你听起来对这疯狂的部分挺开心的。”

Shinji's smile didn't fade at all. "Yeah," he said quietly. "The good part, anyway. There's bad too. I might be more like my father than I thought. I'm counting on Asuka keeping me from being like him. And you can call it crazy if you want, but I trust her to do that."

真嗣的笑容丝毫未减。“嗯，”他轻声说道，“至少是好的一面。也有不好的一面。我可能比我以为的更像我父亲。我指望明日香能阻止我变得像他那样。你要是觉得这很疯狂，就尽管说吧，但我相信她能做到。”

"Um… that's sorta what I wanted to ask about," Touji began hesitantly. "You and her… I mean, bein' together the way you are, you… you seem really happy, both of ya." He looked at Shinji. "How… I mean, it just sort of happened when you told her how you felt, right?"

"呃……这其实就是我想问的，" 东治有些迟疑地开口，"你和她……我是说，像你们这样在一起，你……你们看起来真的很幸福。" 他看向真嗣，"怎么……我是说，当你向她表达了你的感情后，事情就自然而然地发生了，对吧？"

Shinji nodded. "It... yeah. There was a lot more complicated stuff, but what really brought us together was just a few days ago. She asked me. I told her the truth. That was it."

真嗣点了点头。“嗯……是啊。其实还有很多复杂的事情，但真正让我们走到一起的，就是几天前。她问我。我告诉了她真相。就这样。”

Touji looked even more nervous. "How… how did you know?"

冬二看起来更加紧张了。“你…你怎么知道的？”

"Know what?" 知道吗？

"That… um… th-that you love her."

那就是……呃……你爱她。

"How did I know?" Shinji tore his gaze away from the Evangelion to look at Touji directly. Telling Touji about what he'd seen and done at the heart of Instrumentality, or the deadly years afterward, or even the desperate days of the coup, while true, would not provide the answers his friend was looking for. He'd have to try summarizing years of longing, miscommunication, and angry back-and-forth into something he was only barely past grasping himself. "I… we were separated for years after Third Impact. And I…nearly lost her a couple of times before and during the coup. I saw what life was like without her. I didn't like it. She means more than life to me, Touji. Even if she never tells me she loves me back, I'll still do whatever I have to, to stay by her side. I owe her for times I've failed her in the past, but I'd still be there anyway. Being with her is what makes life worth living for me."

"我怎么知道？" 真嗣将目光从福音战士身上移开，直视着东治。向他讲述自己在人类补完计划核心的经历，或是那致命的几年，甚至是政变的绝望日子，虽然都是事实，却无法给出朋友所寻求的答案。他必须尝试将多年的渴望、误解和愤怒的争执浓缩成他自己也仅勉强理解的东西。"我……我们在第三次冲击后分离多年。我……在政变前后差点失去她几次。我见识了没有她的生活是怎样的。我不喜欢那样。她对我来说比生命更重要，东治。即使她从不回应我的爱，我也会尽我所能留在她身边。我欠她过去未能守护她的时光，但无论如何我都会在那里。与她相伴，对我而言，才是生活的意义所在。"

Touji looked anything but comforted by this speech. His leg kept bouncing nervously as his hands kept flitting around restlessly, seemingly unable to find anyplace to rest for more than a few seconds. "I… um… man… Hikari and me…"

透二对这番话显然没有感到丝毫安慰。他的腿不停地紧张地弹跳着，双手也焦躁不安地四处游移，似乎找不到任何能停留几秒钟的地方。“我……呃……天哪……光和我……”

"You and Hikari," Shinji nodded. "Yes, you two?"

"你和光," 真嗣点头道，"是的，你们俩？"

"We… um… I… she…" Touji's face was bright red by now.

"我们…呃…我…她…" 此时，冬二的脸已经涨得通红。

Shinji sighed with a smile and decided to throw his flailing friend a line. "You and Hikari are suddenly growing really close, you've liked her for a long time, and you think you might even love her, but you're worried that its happening so quickly and you're not sure she feels the same way back at you, and so on?"

真嗣带着微笑叹了口气，决定向挣扎中的朋友抛出救生索。“你和光突然变得非常亲近，你已经喜欢她很久了，甚至觉得自己可能爱上了她，但又担心这一切发生得太快，不确定她是否也对你有同样的感觉，诸如此类的担忧？”

Touji flushed further, but calmed his halting babble. "Uh, yeah, pretty much."

冬二脸更红了，但还是平复了结巴的胡言乱语。“呃，是啊，差不多。”

"Welcome to my world," Shinji said in a slightly tired voice.

"欢迎来到我的世界，" 真嗣用略带疲惫的声音说道。

"Uh, what?" "呃，什么？"

"That sounds pretty familiar. Like I know what I'm doing? Asuka and I have only really been together for two and a half days! And we've got a lot of issues still between us." Shinji sighed. "I'm happier being with her than I've ever been before, Touji, but it's not like my confessing magically fixed everything between us. Last night she didn't tell me 'I love you.' She never has. She said 'I still hate you, you know'."

这听起来挺熟悉的。就像我知道自己在做什么似的？我和明日香真正在一起的时间才两天半！我们之间还有很多问题。” 真嗣叹了口气。“和她在一起，我比以往任何时候都要快乐，东治，但这并不意味着我的表白就神奇地解决了我们之间的一切。昨晚她没有对我说‘我爱你’。她从没说过。她说的是‘我还是讨厌你，你知道的’。”

"She… hates you? What?" Touji rubbed his temples in confusion. "But, but…you two have been practically joined at the lips since we got here! This is the first time I've seen you more than five meters from her in two days! And, and Hikari said…" His voice dropped to an embarrassed whisper as he blushed again. "She said you two have even… um, gone all the way!"

她……恨你？什么？”冬二困惑地揉着太阳穴，“但是，但是……自从我们到这里以来，你们俩几乎形影不离！这是我两天来第一次看到你离她超过五米！而且，而且光她说……”他的声音降到了尴尬的耳语，脸再次泛红，“她说你们甚至已经……嗯，彻底在一起了！”

Shinji felt his cheeks burning, but couldn't totally stop his grin. "Ah… yes, the night of the ball. And last night," he managed to say with only a slight blush. 'I never thought I'd be able to say something like that, either.'

绫濑感到脸颊发烫，却无法完全抑制住笑容。“啊……是的，舞会那晚。还有昨晚，”他勉强说道，脸上带着一丝红晕。我也没想到自己能说出这样的话。'

Touji stared wide-eyed at him. "But… but… huh? If… if… she hates you, then… huh?"

冬二瞪大眼睛看着他。“但是…但是…啊？如果…如果…她讨厌你，那…啊？”

"When SEELE sent their nine Evas to attack NERV, Asuka fought alone to stop them. I… failed her. I couldn't do it. I'd just watched Misato die trying to get me there, and I couldn't make myself get back in the Entry Plug again. I just fell apart on the catwalk, staring at Eva Unit-01. It was trapped in Bakelite, but I didn't even try to break it out until it was too late. Asuka was… when I got to the surface, the Mass Production Eva were chewing on Unit-02's pieces. Asuka was… gone. I… kind of lost it then. But she's hated me since then for failing to come to her aid when she needed me most, both then and when the 15th Angel ripped into her mind. She's been through terrible pain because of my failures. I can't argue with it. Her hating me is justified. But I've sworn to her I'll make it up."

当 SEELE 派出九台 EVA 攻击 NERV 时，明日香孤身奋战试图阻止他们。我……辜负了她。我做不到。我眼睁睁看着美里为了送我到达那里而牺牲，而我却无法让自己再次进入插入栓。我只是在天桥上崩溃，凝视着 EVA 初号机。它被困在树脂中，但我直到为时已晚才尝试解救它。明日香她……当我到达地面时，量产型 EVA 正在撕咬着二号机的残骸。明日香她……消失了。我……那时几乎崩溃了。但她从那以后就恨我，因为我没有在她最需要我的时候伸出援手，无论是那时还是当第十五使徒侵入她心灵的时候。她因为我的失败承受了巨大的痛苦。我无法辩驳。她恨我是理所应当的。但我已向她发誓，我会弥补这一切。

"But… I've seen how you two look at each other! You both freakin' light up when you do! Why does she want you around her if she hates you?" Touji looked utterly confused.

但是……我见过你们俩看对方的眼神！你们一对视就整个人都亮起来了！如果她讨厌你，为什么还要你待在她身边呢？” 东二看起来完全摸不着头脑。

Shinji shrugged. "I don't think she wants to hate me, but I have a lot to make up to her. I want to believe that she trusts my promise to make it right. And she told me…she's sorry for when she hurt me before, and that I make it stop hurting when I hold her. She made me swear to never leave her. That was easy, because I never want to. Making her happy makes me happy." He raised his head to meet Touji's eyes. "That it. That's what made me sure. When she hurts, I hurt. I would do anything to take away her pain. And when she's happy, that makes me happier than anything. She's everything to me."

真嗣耸了耸肩：“我觉得她并不想恨我，但我欠她的太多了。我愿意相信她信任我会弥补一切。她告诉我……她为之前伤害我而道歉，还说当我抱着她时，痛苦就停止了。她让我发誓永远不会离开她。这很容易，因为我从未想过要离开。让她快乐，我也会快乐。”他抬起头，直视东治的眼睛，“就是这样。这让我确信无疑。她痛苦时，我也痛苦。我愿意做任何事来消除她的痛苦。而当她快乐时，那比什么都让我更快乐。她就是我的全部。”

Touji gulped. "S-so if… if… me and Hikari… um…"

冬二咽了咽口水。“那…那如果…我和光…呃…”

Shinji held up his hand. "Hold it. Let's try this one step at a time. Do you feel better when your near her? Does it feel right when you hold her? When she's sad, are you sad too? Do you think you'd ever hurt her on purpose?"

真嗣举起手：“等等。我们一步一步来。你靠近她时感觉好些吗？你抱着她时感觉对吗？她难过时，你也难过吗？你觉得你会故意伤害她吗？”

Nods, at first tentative, then firmer, and one vigorous shake of negation.

起初是试探性的点头，随后愈发坚定，最后是一个有力的否定摇头。

Shinji pressed on. "Do you feel like you'd do anything to protect her from pain and harm?"

真嗣继续追问：“你是否觉得，为了保护她免受痛苦和伤害，你愿意做任何事？”

"Yes." 是的。

"When she's happy, are you?"

她开心时，你呢？

"Yes." 是的。

"Does making her happy and safe feel like the most important thing in the world to you?"

让她快乐和安全对你来说是否感觉是世界上最重要的事？

Touji gulped again. "Yes," he said, sounding almost afraid.

冬至再次咽了咽口水。“是的，”他说，声音里几乎带着恐惧。

"Well, I'm not exactly an expert, but that sounds like what I feel for Asuka. And I'm pretty sure I'm in love. So…" Shinji said slowly.

“嗯，我虽算不上专家，但那感觉就像我对明日香的感情。而且我非常确定，我爱上了她。所以……” 真嗣缓缓地说道。

Touji looked like he was about to pass out again, his chest heaving like he'd just sprinted up from the lowest floor of the stadium. "So… so what should I do?!"

透吉看起来又要晕过去了，他的胸膛剧烈起伏，仿佛刚从体育馆的最底层冲刺上来。“那……那我该怎么办？！”

"Um… tell her, maybe?" Shinji hazarded.

"呃……告诉她，或许？" 真嗣试探着说。

Touji paled. He opened and closed his mouth repeatedly without any words emerging. "I... I… w-want to, b-but… it's scary!" he eventually stuttered. "What if I screw it up? What if she says 'no'?" His eyes bugged out. "What if she says 'yes'?! She might want to…" He slammed to a verbal halt as it hit him. "Um… what's it like?"

冬二脸色苍白，嘴巴张合数次，却发不出声音。"我...我…想，但…太可怕了！"他终于结巴着说出口。"万一搞砸了怎么办？万一她说'不'呢？"他的眼睛瞪得老大。"万一她说'是'呢？！她可能也想…"他突然语塞，仿佛意识到了什么。"呃…那感觉是怎样的？"

"What's what like?" Shinji asked.

"那是什么样的？" 真嗣问道。

Touji turned red. "Um… um… sex?"

冬二脸红了。“呃……呃……性？”

Shinji gave Touji a mildly amused look. "Blushing at just saying the word? What happened to the Touji who couldn't stop drooling over Ayanami's calves, thighs, and breasts, or Misato's….everything?"

真嗣带着几分戏谑地看了东治一眼。“只是说说就脸红了？那个对绫波的小腿、大腿和胸部，还有美里姐的……所有一切，都垂涎三尺的东治去哪儿了？”

"This is different! Hikari is… is…" His friend trailed off, at a total loss for words.

这不一样！光是……是……" 他的朋友话音渐弱，完全词穷了。

Shinji let a small smile spread on his face. As funny as it was to watch his friend squirm, a prisoner of his own inarticulate nature, he felt a lot of sympathy for him. He might have had a better vocabulary, but he hadn't been much better at communicating with Asuka either, after all. "Let me guess; the idea of just holding her and being close is more important than just trying to get into her panties?"

真嗣的脸上露出一丝微笑。尽管看着朋友因不善言辞而陷入窘境颇为有趣，但他内心充满了同情。毕竟，他自己与明日香交流时也并未表现得更好，词汇虽丰富，沟通却同样困难。“让我猜猜，仅仅是抱着她、靠近她，比试图进入她的心房更为重要吧？”

Touji gave a sheepish nod, as if being caught having feelings was more embarrassing than talking about sex. "Um, yeah. Like that. But I… still wanna know, y'know? I mean, after the ball, Hikari and me… um… she…" He gulped again. "She… um… was really… um… intent. We didn't…do it, but we came close. So… so I'm kinda lookin' for… um… I wanna know what it's like before… er… I can't hold out no more."

透二尴尬地点了点头，仿佛被人发现有感情比谈论性事还要尴尬。“嗯，就是这样。但我……还是想知道，你懂的吧？我是说，舞会之后，我和光……呃……她……”他再次咽了口唾沫。“她……呃……真的很……呃……认真。我们没有……做到那一步，但已经很接近了。所以……所以我在寻找……呃……我想在……呃……我再也忍不住之前知道那是什么感觉。”

"'Can't hold out no more'?" Shinji repeated, blinking. He started to laugh, building and building until he was holding his sides and crying. He hadn't laughed this hard in years. "Whahahaha! Oh no, poor Touji! Whatever will you do? The girl you've been crushing on for months wants to throw you into bed and ride you all night! Oh, but will she still be there in the morning to make an honest woman of you?"

"'再也坚持不住了？'真嗣重复道，眨了眨眼。他开始大笑，笑声越来越大，直到他捧腹流泪。他已经好几年没有笑得这么厉害了。'哈哈哈！哦不，可怜的东治！你该怎么办呢？你暗恋了几个月的女孩想把你扔到床上，整夜骑着你！哦，但到了早上，她还会在那里让你成为一个正直的女人吗？"

"Hey! It's not funny! Quit laughing!" Touji grabbed Shinji into a headlock and tried applying a noogie, but Shinji still couldn't stop laughing and smiling. Touji was using his left arm. Shinji would happily have taken anything Touji cared to dish out that way.

"嘿！这不好笑！别笑了！" 东治一把将真嗣拉进头锁，试图给他一个脑瓜崩，但真嗣还是止不住地笑。东治用的是左臂。真嗣乐意接受东治用这种方式给予的任何惩罚。

Shinji's left wrist began to vibrate and chime at him, interrupting the friendly abuse. He managed to get his right hand across his body to tap the 'answer' button. "Hello? Ow! Quit it, Touji!"

真嗣的左手腕开始震动并发出响声，打断了友好的调侃。他费力地用右手横过身体，轻触了“接听”按钮。“喂？哎哟！别闹了，东治！”

"Oi! Baka! Where the Hell are you?" Asuka's voice greeted him.

"喂！笨蛋！你到底在哪儿？" 明日香的声音迎面而来。

"Up in the top deck of the stands, watching the world. Touji's giving me a noogie. Where are you?"

在看台的最高层，俯瞰世界。东治正在给我揉头。你在哪儿？

"The command pit. Get your firm little buns down here on the double. Sergeant Bir wants to give us the story on the 'Code Dragonfly' thing, and we've only got an hour or two before we need to be back aboard the ship. Bring that overgrown monkey, too."

"指挥坑。赶紧把你那紧实的小屁股挪到这儿来，快点。伯尔中士要给我们讲讲那个'蜻蜓代码'的事，我们只有一两个小时就得回船上了。把那只发育过度的猴子也带上。"

"Roger, we'll be down in a few minutes." There was a tiny beep as Asuka ended the call. Shinji stood up and stretched.

"罗杰，我们几分钟后就下去。" 通话结束时，明日香那边传来一声微弱的哔声。真嗣站起身，伸了个懒腰。

Touji snickered at his friend. "'Firm little buns', huh?"

透二窃笑地看着他的朋友。“'结实的小圆面包'，是吧？”

Shinji blushed a little, but shot back, "Wait until Hikari starts talking that way about you, mister basketball star." He laughed again as Touji swallowed and started to sweat.

真嗣脸颊微红，反驳道：“等你听到光那样谈论你的时候，篮球明星先生。”他再次笑了起来，而东治则是咽了口口水，开始冒汗。

Part 57 第 57 章

Holding The Line 坚守防线

A few minutes heading down stairs and across the compound got them back to the command pit. The two young men didn't make it five meters into the room before Hikari intercepted Touji and latched on to his side. He didn't look at all upset by her proximity. Neither did she by the broad smile she was wearing. Shinji gave one last chuckle at them, and moved to the edge of the battle table next to Asuka, who greeted him with a mere nod, but quickly linked her hand in his below the rim of the table.

下楼梯穿过院子，几分钟便回到了指挥所。两位年轻人刚踏进房间不到五米，光就截住了冬二，紧贴在他身旁。他对她的靠近丝毫不显困扰，而她脸上挂着的灿烂笑容也未见半分不悦。真嗣对着他们轻笑一声，然后走到战斗桌边，挨着明日香。明日香仅以点头示意，但很快在桌下悄悄握住了他的手。

Sergeant Bir and Ching were right across the table from them. Sergeant Bir also nodded as Shinji arrived, and glanced around to be sure he had all the former NERV personnel and Shinji's classmates gathered. Shinji looked around too, and was suddenly struck by an oddity; of his friends and colleagues gathered here, only Kensuke wasn't paired up with someone. He didn't seem to be upset at the moment, though. He was standing on Kaji's left, bouncing and beaming happily. He'd gotten to fly his Black Knight in support of Kaji's group to the west of the city, for a smaller incident like the one Red Whirlwind had settled.

比尔中士和青坐在他们对面。比尔中士在真嗣到来时也点了点头，环顾四周确保所有前 NERV 人员和真嗣的同学都已聚集。真嗣也环视了一圈，突然注意到一个奇怪的现象：聚集在此的朋友们和同事中，只有健介没有伴侣。不过他此刻似乎并不沮丧，而是站在加持的左边，兴奋地跳跃着，满脸笑容。他得以驾驶他的黑色骑士支援加持的团队前往城市西侧，处理一起类似红色旋风解决的小事件。

Sergeant Bir rapped his knuckles on the table and began. "Alright, now that you're all here, and the commanders have to be back aboard the fleet in the near future, I'm going to take the chance to tell you about how we got 'Code Dragonfly' as the call for a unit that's been cut off." He touched a couple of virtual buttons on the table's surface.

中士比尔敲了敲桌子，开始说道：“好了，既然大家都到齐了，指挥官们也即将返回舰队，我趁这个机会告诉你们，我们是如何将‘蜻蜓代码’作为与被切断联系的部队联络的代号。”他触碰了桌面上的几个虚拟按钮。

A black starfield filled the tabletop's display. A pair of spacecraft swam into view; a large, ovoid-hulled ship and a smaller, more angular one that had a pair of smaller hulls alongside its main one like outriggers. The overall appearance was that of a whale being escorted by a shark. The blue and white globe of Earth was visible behind them. "This happened a long time ago, about sixty thousand years after the Founding. The CGS Ibthan's Dragonfly was a light corvette trade protection ship assigned to escort the merchantman IMS Brass Slipper on a far-reach trade mission, just heading out to a random set of worldines that hadn't been surveyed before. They'd just reached a near-baseline Earth, essentially like your world, pre-Second Impact, when they suddenly went dark. All contact with them was cut off. Despite the Empire's best efforts, we couldn't open a portal to them or make any sort of contact for what turned out to be three years on their side. When the rescue fleet, which was half of Home Fleet and most of the Imperial Guard in Primastra, managed to get a portal open to their worldline, it was over two hundred light-years away from Earth. That was a close as they could get even after what the lost ships had finally done to weaken the block."

一张黑色星域图填满了桌面显示屏。两艘飞船映入眼帘：一艘大型卵形船体飞船与一艘较小的、棱角分明的飞船，后者主船体两侧各有一对小型船体，宛如外伸支架。整体形象犹如一头鲸鱼正被鲨鱼护送。地球的蓝白球体在它们后方清晰可见。“这发生在很久以前，大约是建国后六万年。CGS 伊布桑的蜻蜓号是一艘轻型护卫舰，负责保护商船 IMS 黄铜拖鞋号执行一次远距离贸易任务，正前往一系列之前未曾勘测过的世界线。他们刚抵达一个接近基准地球的环境，基本上与你的世界相似，处于第二次冲击前，突然间便失去了联系。与他们的所有联络都被切断。尽管帝国竭尽全力，我们无法为他们开启传送门，也无法以任何方式取得联系，结果在他们那边过去了三年。当救援舰队——由半数家园舰队及普里马斯特拉大部分帝国卫队组成——终于成功为他们所在的世界线开启传送门时，却发现距离地球已超过两百光年。” 即便在那些失踪船只最终削弱了封锁之后，他们也只能接近到这种程度。"

"When the fleet reached Sol, they found an entire armada of a very strange alien species with a never-before-seen type of drive on their ships. That was what had been screwing with the portals, something about their drive. The block had been weakened when the armada's mothership had been destroyed." Sergeant Bir paused for a moment. "We got the full story from the Second Mate of the Brass Slipper after the fleet finished wiping the armada out."

当舰队抵达太阳系时，他们发现了一整支由一种极其奇特的外星物种组成的大型舰队，这些舰船装备了一种前所未见的推进系统。正是这种推进系统干扰了传送门，具体原因不明。当这支舰队的母舰被摧毁后，干扰效应有所减弱。伯尔中士停顿了一下，继续说道：“在舰队彻底消灭了这支外星舰队后，我们从‘黄铜拖鞋号’的二副那里得知了整个事件的来龙去脉。”

"They'd lost contact with us just before their long-range sensors picked up the armada's approach. They had time to get every Imperial off the planet and run. They were fast enough they could have probably stayed ahead of the fleet, found the edge of the effect, and escaped, especially if the whole fleet stopped to slag Earth. All they had to do was abandon Earth and seven billion souls to their fate." Bir smiled grimly. "This, of course, never even crossed their minds. Someone on that Earth had to point it out and ask why they didn't. The crew just looked at him like he was nuts. That Earth had practically no defenses. Leaving would not only be cowardice, it would be tantamount to seven billion murders by depraved indifference. So they stayed, and became the nucleus of Earth's defenses. Managed a pretty decent set of ground and orbital defenses by the time the fleet actually entered the system."

就在他们的远程传感器探测到舰队逼近前不久，他们与我们失去了联系。他们有时间将所有帝国人员撤离地球并逃离。他们的速度足够快，本可以领先于舰队，找到效应边缘并逃脱，尤其是在整个舰队停下来摧毁地球的情况下。他们所要做的就是抛弃地球和七十亿灵魂的命运。"比尔冷笑道。"当然，他们甚至从未考虑过这一点。地球上有人不得不指出这一点并询问他们为什么不这么做。船员们只是像看疯子一样看着他。那个地球几乎没有任何防御。离开不仅是懦弱，更是对七十亿人因极度冷漠而导致的谋杀。所以他们留了下来，成为了地球防御的核心。在舰队实际进入系统之前，他们已经建立了一套相当不错的地面和轨道防御体系。"

He tapped the button again. An array of icons populated the globe of Earth, showing a worldwide set of ground bases and multiple space stations at various orbital heights. The two ships hung further out from the ring of Luna's orbit, the Dragonfly intermittently dashing out to strike at parts of the hostile fleet. "Attempts at contact for negotiation got nowhere. The invaders had some sort of religious conviction that wiping out all other sentients pleased their gods." The icon for the Dragonfly slowly turned yellow,then red, then almost black. Gaps began to appear in the rings of stations and bases on Earth. Large circular craters formed in spots in Siberia, Africa, and other places. The corner of Australia where Sydney lay abruptly became a huge circular bay. "The Ibthan's Dragonfly was just a Clan O'Brien trade-protection ship, very small and lightly armed by Imperial Navy standards, but more than a match for what the invaders could throw at them. But they had tens of thousands of ships. After most of a year of holding them off, they'd eventually taken crippling damage to the Dragonfly, and eventually the Brass Slipper too, when damage to the Dragonfly forced her to be pressed into service as an improvised warship. The invaders had slowly been chipping away at Earth's defenses as well. With both ships out of action, and no sign of help coming, it had become only a matter of time before they could no longer effectively protect the planet."

他再次轻触按钮，地球模型上涌现出一系列图标，展示了遍布全球的地面基地和多个位于不同轨道高度的空间站。两艘飞船悬停在月球轨道之外，其中“蜻蜓号”不时冲出，突袭敌对舰队的部分区域。“尝试进行谈判的接触毫无进展，入侵者似乎抱有某种宗教信念，认为消灭所有其他智慧生命体能取悦他们的神明。”蜻蜓号的图标逐渐由黄变红，直至近乎黑色。地球上的空间站和基地环带开始出现缺口，西伯利亚、非洲等地出现了巨大的圆形陨石坑，而悉尼所在的澳大利亚一角骤然化作一个巨大的圆形海湾。“伊布坦人的蜻蜓号原本只是奥布莱恩氏族用于贸易保护的小型舰船，按帝国海军标准来看装备轻简，却足以应对入侵者所能派遣的任何力量。然而，他们拥有数以万计的战舰。” 经过大半年的顽强抵抗，他们最终让“蜻蜓号”遭受了重创，而当“蜻蜓号”受损被迫改装成临时战舰时，“黄铜拖鞋号”也难逃厄运。入侵者逐渐削弱了地球的防御力量。随着两艘飞船均无法行动，且救援无望，他们有效保护地球的日子已屈指可数。"

"So Junior Lieutenant Commander of the Red Zenia Delaney, the deputy commander of the Dragonfly's flight wing and senior surviving military officer at that point, had a proposal. Once she explained it, the UN Secretary-General made one attempt to dissuade her… but stopped. There were no other choices." Bir looked up from the table at Shinji and Asuka. "There is power in death, as I'm sure you're aware. Even on a world like this, where magic and spiritual powers are pretty low, it's there. You've felt it yourselves, in what you went through. And even when they are low, you all know how extraordinary things can be achieved when you know that everything you hold dear is riding on that one final effort. With a little application of Imperial technology, every TV, radio, PA speaker, cell phone… every sound system on Earth was linked in to hear their Death Ride. All of Terra, six and a half billion people, could hear them." A sub screen with sheet music appeared in the corner of the display.

于是，红泽尼亚号的少尉指挥官德莱尼，作为蜻蜓飞行队的副指挥官及当时最高级别的幸存军官，提出了一个建议。在她解释完毕后，联合国秘书长曾试图劝阻她……但最终停了下来。别无选择。"比尔从桌前抬头看向真嗣和明日香，"正如你们所知，死亡中蕴含着力量。即便在这个魔法与灵力相对稀薄的世界，它依然存在。你们在经历中所感受到的，便是这种力量。即便力量微弱，当你们深知所珍视的一切都寄托在那最后的努力上时，非凡之事便能成就。借助帝国科技的少许应用，地球上每一台电视、收音机、扩音器、手机……所有音响系统都被连接起来，共同聆听着他们的死亡冲锋。整个地球，六十五亿人，都能听到他们的声音。"显示屏一角出现了一个带有乐谱的子屏幕。

Shinji's eyes quickly recognized the melody. "'O Fortuna!'?," he asked. "From 'Carmina Burana'?"

真嗣的眼睛迅速识别出了旋律。“《噢，命运女神！》？”他问道，“来自《布兰诗歌》？”

"Every living person on Earth could hear their song and give them their strength. The prayers and will of six and a half billion souls… If they were going to face the end, humanity would do it with a sword in hand, taking them down with them. They might fall, but they would not be defeated. Not for nothing is the motto of the Clan Guards, and all of Clan O'Brien, 'Morior Invictus'."

地球上的每个生灵都能听见他们的歌声，并赋予他们力量。六十五亿灵魂的祈祷与意志……如果人类将要面对终结，他们将手持利剑，与之同归于尽。他们或许会倒下，但绝不会被击败。这正是奥布莱恩家族及其所有卫队的座右铭“Morior Invictus”（虽死犹荣）的真谛。

Latin definitely not being on his skill list, Shinji looked at Asuka. She was still watching the display on the table. "'I Die Unconquered'," she said without looking up.

拉丁语显然不在他的技能清单上，真嗣看向明日香。她仍在注视着桌上的显示屏。“‘我死而未败’，”她没有抬头地说道。

Shinji looked back at Sergeant Bir. "They were cut off like we are here. You said there was no way for their souls to go home, that they couldn't be revived. They knew this was a one-way trip."

真嗣回头望向比尔中士。“他们就像我们一样被切断了联系。你说过他们的灵魂无法回家，也无法复活。他们知道这是一次单程旅行。”

Bir nodded. "They were Clan Guards. Every member of the remaining crew of both ships volunteered, even the merchantmen on the Brass Slipper." On the display a broad wedge of tiny icons left the Dragonfly and headed straight for the largest invader ship, deep in the center of their fleet. "Lieutenant Commander Delaney led the remaining seventy-three Star Hawk IVs of the Dragonfly's original one hundred on an all-or-nothing strike at their mothership, every fighter running at 100% past redline on their engines." The icons drew together and became a single broad arrowhead. "They tore through the invaders blocking ships like a plasma torch through paper. Their attack culminated with a ram of the entire squadron as a single unit into the mothership, bonded together into a single giant wedge of energy by all they'd called on…" The arrowhead reached the mothership icon, and dove into it without slowing at display went white. When the glow faded, the mothership and the center of the invader's fleet were gone. So was the arrowhead.

比尔点头道：“他们是氏族卫士。两艘船上剩余的每一位成员都自愿参加了，就连‘黄铜拖鞋’号上的商人们也不例外。”显示屏上，一大群小图标从“蜻蜓”号出发，直奔敌方舰队中心最大的入侵船只而去。“德莱尼中尉指挥着‘蜻蜓’号原本一百架星鹰 IV 型战机中剩余的七十三架，对敌人的母舰发起了孤注一掷的攻击，所有战机引擎都以超过红线的 100%功率运转。”这些图标汇聚成一个巨大的箭头。“他们像等离子切割器穿透纸张一样撕裂了阻挡的敌舰。他们的攻击以整个中队作为一个整体冲撞母舰而达到高潮，所有力量凝聚成一个巨大的能量楔子……”箭头触及母舰图标，毫不减速地冲入其中，显示屏随之变得一片空白。当光芒消退，母舰及敌方舰队中心已不复存在，箭头也随之消失。

"The attack succeeded. The destruction of the mothership diminished the blocking effect enough that we could get Imperial Navy units in to that worldine, albeit very far away. They come across as close as they could, and came screaming into the Sol system at full speed." The display zoomed out until the Earth and the Moon filled only a small bit of the center. Huge icons for Imperial Navy planetoid-type warships appeared moving in from the edges. The lead ship was visibly larger than Luna. "The rescue force was led by the Imperial Navy flagship, the HMS Avalon. No one heard their approach until they were almost on top of the invaders because all channels near Terra were still taken up by the Death Ride song. They landed on the invaders like the Lady's own fury." The engagement was less a battle than an extermination. None of the invader's fleet even tried to flee. "They were in time to recover seventeen survivors from the charge, all in bad shape. Lieutenant Commander Delaney was not among them. They'd shot right through the mothership and out the other side, all of them in crippled wrecks of mecha."

攻击成功了。母舰的毁灭减弱了阻塞效应，使得我们能够将帝国海军单位派遣至那个世界线，尽管距离非常遥远。他们尽可能地靠近，然后以全速呼啸着冲入太阳系。显示屏缩放至地球和月球仅占据中心一小部分，巨大的帝国海军行星型战舰图标从边缘涌入。领头的战舰明显比月球还要庞大。救援行动由帝国海军旗舰 HMS 阿瓦隆号率领。由于地球附近的通讯频道仍被“死亡冲锋”之歌占据，直到他们几乎抵达入侵者头顶，才有人察觉到他们的到来。他们如同女神的怒火般降临在入侵者身上。这场交锋与其说是战斗，不如说是灭绝。入侵者的舰队甚至未曾尝试逃跑。他们及时救出了十七名幸存者，状况都十分糟糕。其中并没有中尉指挥官德莱尼的身影。他们直接穿透了母舰，从另一侧冲出，所有机甲都已残破不堪。

Asuka had been staring intently at the screen. When Sergeant Bir fell silent, she hesitated for a minute waiting for him to continue. When he said nothing, she raised her head to fix him with a stare. "If this story is supposed to give us hope, it's rather grim," she said flatly.

明日香一直专注地盯着屏幕。当比尔中士沉默下来时，她犹豫了一分钟，等待他继续。见他一言不发，她抬起头，目光紧锁在他身上。“如果这个故事本意是给我们带来希望，那它可真是阴郁。”她平淡地说道。

"Grim? They won. They saved that Earth, and six and a half billion lives. We will complete our mission, ma'am, no matter what tries to oppose us. And the Empire will come for us. But that's not the end of what I wanted to tell you about this. One of the crew of the Dragonfly was Eliza Elise O'Brien, Princess Of The Blood and daughter of the Emperor and Empress. When they called for volunteers, nine members of the crew had to restrain her when she demanded the honor of taking point. Lieutenant Commander Delaney wouldn't let her lead the charge. That was her privilege. And when the Emperor arrived with the rescue fleet, the Empress herself had to stop him from pushing back up the timestream into the blocked zone to try to save them. The effort would likely have destabilized and collapsed the local reality, but He was ready to do it. 'No sparrow shall fall, that We do not save it', he'd promised all of us." Sergeant Bir looked right back at her. "The Emperor protects, ma'am. That's what's looking out for us, and is coming to our aid; a loyalty and will that can bend the cosmos and break the stars in order to save his people. And no member of the Imperial Family will ever ask someone else to die for them. They always try to be out front, always between us and any threat. And because they will never ask, we are only too proud to."

严峻吗？他们赢了。他们拯救了那个地球，以及六十五亿生命。我们将完成使命，女士，无论什么试图阻挠我们。帝国也会来救我们。但这并非我想告诉你的全部。蜻蜓号上的一名船员是伊莉莎·伊莉斯·奥布莱恩，皇族血脉的公主，皇帝与皇后的女儿。当他们征集志愿者时，九名船员不得不制止她，因为她要求获得冲锋的荣誉。海军中校德莱尼不允许她带头冲锋，那是她的特权。而当皇帝带着救援舰队抵达时，皇后本人不得不阻止他逆时间流而上，试图进入封锁区去拯救他们。此举很可能导致当地现实的不稳定和崩溃，但他已做好准备。“没有一只麻雀坠落，而我们不去拯救”，他曾向我们所有人承诺。”伯尔中士直视着她。“皇帝守护着我们，女士。这就是在关照我们，并即将前来援助我们的力量；一种忠诚与意志，足以扭曲宇宙、粉碎星辰，只为拯救他的人民。 皇室家族的任何成员都不会要求他人为自己而死。他们总是身先士卒，始终站在我们与任何威胁之间。正因他们从不要求，我们才更自豪地愿意如此。"

"'Course, that ain't exactly 'Plan A'," TJ said coolly from the right side of the table. He gave Sergeant Bir a more determined look than any Shinji had ever seen on the young prince's face before. "Rajadharma, Sergeant. Protection of his subjects is the first and foremost duty of a king. We cannot pretend to any right to be the Imperial Family if we fail at that most basic calling. I will not be one who brings shame on my house. There are centillions on centillions of Citizens and Subjects that pledge us their loyalty and service, and we will be worthy of it. I too will do whatever I have to to protect all of us, no less than any of my ancestors."

"当然，那并非真正的'A 计划'，"TJ 冷静地从桌子的右侧说道。他向比尔中士投去了一个比真嗣以往在年轻王子脸上见过的任何表情都要坚定的目光。"拉贾达摩，中士。保护臣民是国王首要且最重要的职责。如果我们连这最基本的使命都未能履行，就无权自称皇室。我不会成为给家族蒙羞的人。有无数亿的公民和臣民向我们宣誓效忠与服务，我们必须配得上这份信任。我也会尽我所能保护我们所有人，绝不逊色于我的任何一位祖先。"

Bir just dipped his head in acknowledgement, a faint smile on his face. "I would expect no less from you, sir, or anyone else who carries the Name."

伯尔微微点头致意，脸上带着淡淡的微笑。“我对您，或任何拥有名号的人，都不会有更高的期望。”

TJ's eyes narrowed and he tilted his head to the side a little. "This little story-time wasn't just aimed at the NERV folks, was it?"

TJ 的眼神微微眯起，他略微侧了侧头。“这个小故事时间，不只是针对 NERV 的人吧？”

"Now, why would an innocent little NCO like me do something like that, sir?" Sergeant Bir said, utterly deadpan.

"长官，像我这样无辜的小士官，怎么会做出那种事呢？" 比尔中士面无表情地说道。

TJ just shook his head. "Message received, Top. Rajadharma. Dad drilled that into my head good and hard. Like I'd ever forget. Mom just sort of laughed." He snorted. "Hell, Lieutenant Leibshott and Corporal Vasraith are off the Saragarhi. Dad drilled that one in too."

TJ 只是摇了摇头。“收到消息，头儿。拉贾达尔玛。老爸把这个观念狠狠地灌输给我了。我怎么可能忘记。老妈只是笑了笑。”他哼了一声。“见鬼，莱布肖特中尉和瓦斯拉斯下士都来自萨拉加希。老爸也把这个故事讲给我听了。”

"He drilled the ship into you?" Shinji asked, confused. "Was it part of the rescue fleet?"

"他把船钻进你体内了？" 真嗣困惑地问道，"那是救援舰队的一部分吗？"

"Not the ship, the battle it's named for. At Saragarhi, twenty one Sikh soldiers of the British Army of India held their post against an attack by 12,000 Afghans for five hours. Almost six hundred to one odds, and they all volunteered to stand and fight. Died to a man, but they took hundreds of men down before they did, and gave the rest of their brigade time to rally. They stopped the invasion cold. The senior man was a buck sergeant. One of the greatest 'last stands' in pre-space Terran history. My dad trained under a Sikh Gatka master, and his mom was actually from northern India, so they made damn sure I knew all about Sikh heroes." TJ shook his head again and looked over at Shinji. "Guess I just needed a little reminder about who I am. Huh, dude?"

不是那艘船，而是它命名的那场战役。在萨拉戈希，英属印度军队的二十一名锡克士兵坚守阵地，抵御了一万二千名阿富汗人的进攻长达五小时。几乎是六百比一的悬殊比例，他们却都自愿留下战斗。全员壮烈牺牲，但在倒下前他们击倒了数百敌人，为其余部队集结争取了时间。他们彻底阻止了入侵。其中最高军衔者是一名中士。这是太空时代前地球历史上最伟大的“最后一战”之一。我父亲曾师从一位锡克剑术大师，而他母亲实际上来自印度北部，因此他们确保我熟知锡克英雄的事迹。”TJ 再次摇头，看向真嗣，“看来我只是需要一点提醒，让我记起自己是谁。嗯，伙计？”

Shinji just met his look and tried to keep 'I mustn't run away…' from running through his head. He was supposed to be in command with Asuka of a group like this? All of them ready to take on the whole world and die if need be, at his order? 'I don't want this sort of responsibility! I don't want anyone to die! Not for me!' He didn't quite manage to keep his hand from shaking and twitching in Asuka's grip. His free hand had no such limitation.

真嗣只是与他对视，努力不让“我不能逃跑……”的念头在脑海中闪过。他本应与明日香一起指挥这样一个团队吗？所有人都准备好了，只要他一声令下，就与整个世界为敌，必要时甚至牺牲生命？我不想承担这种责任！我不想任何人因我而死！' 他没能完全控制住自己的手，在明日香的紧握中颤抖抽搐。而另一只自由的手则没有这样的限制。

He saw Asuka's eyes flick towards him out of the corner of his own. She squeezed his hand and looked back to Sergeant Bir. "Good to know you're all the good kind of crazy. We'll see you in the morning. You've got the watch, Ching?" The Navy lieutenant nodded. "Then it's time for us to be seen on the UN fleet. Goodnight." She turned towards the transport pad, pulling Shinji with her by their linked hands.

他瞥见明日香的目光从眼角扫向他。她紧握他的手，转头看向比尔中士。“很高兴知道你疯得恰到好处。我们明早见。今晚是你值班，清？”海军中尉点头。“那我们该在联合国舰队露个面了。晚安。”她转身朝运输平台走去，牵着他们紧握的手，拉着真嗣一同前行。

### Chapter 31 Living The Dream - Face Your Demons

'So I'm just as capable as my father of deciding nothing in the world is as important to me as one woman. If I can be as unrestrained in protecting Asuka as he was in trying to get mother back… but I don't want to turn as evil towards everyone else like he did. So I'll use Asuka to stop myself. Is that what father tried to do with mother? Was she all that kept him really human? And why he went mad when she disappeared? Losing Asuka drove me mad once already. …Without her, would I become just like him? Empty, angry, and alone? Who am I, when everything is taken away?'

因此，我与父亲一样，能够认定世上没有任何事物比一个女人更重要。如果我能像他试图挽回母亲那样，毫无顾忌地保护明日香……但我不想像他那样对其他人变得邪恶。所以我会利用明日香来阻止自己。父亲是否也曾试图通过母亲来做到这一点？她是否是他保持人性的唯一支柱？这就是为何母亲消失后他会发疯的原因吗？失去明日香已让我疯狂过一次。……没有她，我会不会变得和他一样？空虚、愤怒且孤独？当一切都被剥夺后，我又是谁？

"You're thinking, Shinji," Asuka said from her position lying on the bed.

"你在想什么呢，真嗣。" 明日香躺在床上说道。

Shinji snapped out of his brown study and focused on Asuka. After their brief dinner in the galley to be seen by the crew, they'd returned to their cabin. Asuka had laid on the bed, listening to him play. He'd been deep in thought, but had kept smoothly playing his cello. Years of practice almost let his hands play simpler pieces without him even having to think about it, so he'd let them while he tried to process today's events. "I'm sorry?"

真嗣从沉思中回过神来，将注意力转向明日香。他们在船员可见的餐厅匆匆用过晚餐后，便回到了自己的舱室。明日香躺在床上，聆听着他的演奏。他虽心事重重，却依旧流畅地拉着大提琴。多年的练习几乎让他在演奏简单曲目时无需思考，于是他便任由双手自行其是，同时试图梳理今日发生的一切。“对不起？”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Don't start that again, Third. Now, what's with you? When you're thinking about what you're playing, you close your eyes. You've been staring into space for a good half hour. What's up?" Her eyes narrowed. "Are you philosophizing again?"

明日香翻了个白眼。“别再来了，老三。说吧，你怎么了？一思考你玩的东西就闭眼。你已经盯着空气发呆半小时了。怎么回事？”她眯起眼睛，“又在搞哲学思考了？”

"Um, maybe?" When her look sharpened further, he hurried to explain. "I was thinking about the question you asked me, the one everyone seems to want me to anwer these days, including myself; who am I?" Asuka's expression lightened up, and she gestured conditional permission to continue. "I think… you were right, what you said a couple days ago. 'You make yourself.' Third Impact…" Even now Shinji had to clamp down on an instinctive twitch he felt in breaking their long taboo about the topic, but he pressed on. "Third Impact showed undeniably that the soul and self aren't tethered to the physical body. Self… your very identity is not dependent on the biology or chemistry of your brain, but rather a product of thought. Self is a construct of will inherent to mind. 'Who am I?' is a question I can choose the answer to. All I needed was a strong enough reason, something to start from, to focus on… and now I know I have it."

"呃，可能吧？" 见她目光更加锐利，他急忙解释道，"我在思考你问我的那个问题，那个最近似乎所有人都想让我回答，包括我自己也在追问的问题：'我是谁？' 明日香的表情缓和了些，她示意他可以继续说下去。"我想……你几天前说的没错，'你是自己塑造的'。第三次冲击……" 即便此刻，真嗣在触及他们长久以来的禁忌话题时，仍需压制内心的本能抗拒，但他还是继续说道，"第三次冲击无可辩驳地证明了灵魂和自我并非依附于肉体。自我……你的身份并非取决于大脑的生物或化学结构，而是思想的产物。自我是意志内在于心灵的一种构建。'我是谁？' 这个问题，我可以自主选择答案。我所需要的只是一个足够强烈的理由，一个起点，一个聚焦点……而现在我知道我找到了。"

"You're going to say me, aren't you?" Asuka said.

"你要说我了，对吧？" 明日香说道。

He smiled. "'Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth,' Archimedes said. All I needed was that one point of certainty, and I can do anything. And as much as I've ever doubted everything else in my life, I don't have any doubt about loving you." He watched Asuka avoid his gaze. "I'm starting to realize how that makes me a lot like my father, but like you said the morning after the ball, I can take that and use it to build who I want to be."

他微笑着说：“阿基米德曾言：‘给我一个支点，我将撬动地球。’我所需要的，正是那一点确定性，有了它，我便无所不能。尽管我一生中对其他事物多有疑虑，但在爱你这件事上，我从未有过丝毫怀疑。”他注意到明日香避开了他的目光。“我开始意识到，这让我在某种程度上很像我的父亲，但正如你舞会翌日早晨所说，我可以接受这一点，并以此塑造我想要成为的自己。”

"You know all the philosophy bores me, Third," Asuka said slightly wearily, but her voice was oddly soft, lacking the bite the words should have had. She still couldn't meet his eyes.

"你知道所有的哲学都让我厌烦，第三，"明日香略显疲倦地说道，但她的声音出奇地柔和，缺乏了这些话本应有的锋芒。她依旧无法直视他的眼睛。

"I'm sorry. I'm not a genius like you, Asuka. I have to work my way step by step to the conclusion you intuited in one leap of thought. But I'm getting there. I really want to answer the question you asked me at the ball. I really want to be…I am going to be the hero you want by your side. I know what I want now, and I'm going to keep my promises to you, to make up for everything else. And I want this. For the first time I'm running towards something I want, not from something in fear. Nothing matters more to me than making you happy." His face brightened. "Ah! I just remembered!" He laid his cello aside for a second and began tapping at his interface band.

对不起，我不如你那般天才，明日香。我必须一步步地走向你一跃而思的结论。但我正在接近。我真的很想回答你在舞会上问我的问题。我真的很想成为……我将成为你身边所期望的英雄。我现在明白自己想要什么了，我会遵守对你的承诺，弥补其他一切。我渴望这样。第一次，我朝着渴望的事物奔跑，而非因恐惧逃离。没有什么比让你幸福更重要。" 他的脸上露出光彩。"啊！我刚想起来了！" 他暂时放下大提琴，开始敲击他的界面带。

After a moment Asuka's own band beeped to signal the receipt of a message from Shinji's. She looked at in curiously, and tapped the button to open the e-book he'd apparently sent her.

片刻后，明日香自己的手环响起，提示收到来自真嗣的消息。她好奇地看了一眼，随即按下按钮，打开了真嗣显然发给她的电子书。

"I talked to TJ, Lieutenant O'Brien, for a few minutes when you were off with the Class Rep. He gave me a few books on my wristband on philosophy after I mentioned studying it, and he also gave me a book on a field of math I've never even heard of when I asked if he had anything you might like. It's called… um… 'Multi-Dimensional Curved Field Vector Calculus,' I think."

你和班长出去的时候，我和 TJ 中尉聊了几分钟。我提到正在学习哲学后，他通过我的腕带传了几本哲学书籍给我，当我询问是否有你可能会喜欢的书时，他还给了我一本关于我从未听说过的数学领域的书。那本书叫……呃……《多维曲面场向量微积分》，我想是这个名字。

Asuka glanced up at him for a second, her eyes widening a little. "Hm? I've never heard of that either…" She snapped her head back down and expanded the display, diving right into the book. Her expression smoothed itself out into one of intense thought as her eyes eagerly swept back and forth across diagrams and formulae Shinji couldn't even begin to decipher. His mathematical studies had stopped at their junior high Trigonometry, and he'd only managed a B+ there. She blinked after a minute, and raised her head to look at him, smiling slightly. "Thanks, baka." She dove back in.

明日香抬头瞥了他一眼，眼睛微微睁大。“嗯？我也没听说过…”她猛地低下头，展开显示屏，一头扎进书本中。她的表情逐渐转为深思，双眼热切地在难以解读的图表和公式间来回扫视，而真嗣的数学学习仅停留在初中三角函数，且成绩仅为 B+。一分钟后，她眨了眨眼，抬头看向他，嘴角微扬。“谢了，笨蛋。”随即又埋首其中。

Shinji smiled. Asuka was deep into the book already, and looked like she was enjoying it thoroughly. He tapped a few more complicated commands into his band and placed his bow back against the strings of his instrument. He played a mellow Beethoven cello sonata for her as she intently studied a whole new field of mathematics, his wristband providing an amazingly realistic sounding piano accompaniament to his playing. His playing grew more passionate as his smile broadened. They were together, he was playing for her, and she was happy because of something he'd done for her. He'd had dreams… no, fantasies like this. His sleeping dreams were too often filled with nightmares or spectres of loss. But his daydreams… the brightest of them had been like this. After he reached the end of the sonata, he started to laugh softly as he put away his cello.

真嗣微笑着。明日香已经完全沉浸在书本中，看起来非常享受。他又输入了几个复杂的指令到手腕上的装置，然后将弓放回乐器弦上。他为她演奏了一曲柔和的贝多芬大提琴奏鸣曲，而她正专注地探索着数学的新领域，他的腕带提供了极为逼真的钢琴伴奏。随着笑容的扩大，他的演奏也愈发充满激情。他们在一起，他在为她演奏，而她因为他的付出而感到快乐。他曾有过这样的梦……不，是幻想。他夜间的梦境常常充斥着噩梦或失去的幽灵。但他的白日梦……最明亮的那部分，就像现在这样。奏鸣曲结束时，他轻声笑着，收起了大提琴。

The unusual sound brought Asuka back from her reading. "What are you laughing at, Baka-Shinji?" she asked with a smile as he rose and turned towards her.

那不寻常的声音让明日香从阅读中回过神来。“你在笑什么，笨蛋真嗣？”她带着微笑问道，而他站起身转向她。

"You. Me. This. This, this is what I've always dreamed about, Asuka. Being here with you, making you happy, and you knowing how I feel. This is what I've always wanted. It's better than sex." He beamed at her.

你，我，此刻。这就是我一直梦寐以求的，明日香。与你同在，让你快乐，让你知晓我的情感。这正是我始终渴望的。它胜过性爱。" 他向她展露笑容。

Asuka looked away again and reddened. "W… well you better be ready for more of that too, a lot more, since I've decided I like it," she retorted. She paused, then more quietly said, "Say it again."

明日香再次移开视线，脸颊泛红。“你……你最好也准备好迎接更多，很多更多，因为我已经决定我喜欢这样，”她反驳道。她停顿了一下，然后更轻声地说，“再说一遍。”

He knew what she wanted him to say. He had no hesitation in saying it, either. "I love you, Asuka."

他知道她想听他说什么。他毫不犹豫地说出了口：“我爱你，明日香。”

She leapt off the bed and reached for him, grinning…

她从床上跳下来，伸手去抓他，咧嘴笑着……

Part 59 第 59 章

Face Your Demons 直面心魔

Asuka stared at the ceiling of the cabin as she listened to Shinji's slow, even breathing next to her. She still had a lazy, sated smile on her face, and she could feel the sweat slowly drying on her body. 'Mmm… lo~ve that afterglow. Gott, that just keeps getting more and more fun.' She grinned into the darkness for a second. 'So, looks like I'm not the only screamer. I wonder what the crew thinks of all the noise we're making? Heh.' She couldn't wait to share that little tidbit with Hikari. Maybe tease Misato with it too.

明日香凝视着船舱的天花板，聆听着身旁真嗣缓慢而均匀的呼吸声。她脸上依旧挂着慵懒满足的微笑，能感觉到身上的汗水正慢慢干去。嗯……喜欢这种余韵。天啊，这真是越来越有趣了。她在黑暗中咧嘴一笑。看来，我并非唯一的尖叫者。不知道船员们对我们制造的噪音有何感想？嘿。她迫不及待想与光分享这个小趣闻，或许还可以逗逗美里。

She frowned slightly. Having her closest female friend back to indulge in girl-talk with was great, but by that very closeness Hikari also wanted to know about some things Asuka was less eager to share. After they'd returned from their easy mission to La Plata, Hikari had dragged Asuka off for some supposed girl-talk right away. Having a few ideas of what Hikari might want to talk about, Asuka had already started smirking as she considered how to reply to what she expected would be a torrent of breathless questions about sex and related topics.

她微微皱眉。与最亲密的女性朋友重聚，享受闺中密语固然美好，但正是这份亲近，让光也想了解一些明日香不太愿意分享的事情。从拉普拉塔的轻松任务归来后，光立刻拉着明日香去进行所谓的闺中密语。明日香心中已有些许预感光想谈论的话题，她一边考虑着如何回应，一边已经开始窃笑，准备迎接那些关于性及关联话题的连珠炮般急促提问。

But Hikari had found a quiet corner for them to sit in, and with a nervous and serious expression had told Asuka about what she'd seen the day before in Don Barceló's dungeon. About the traumatized, brutalized women she'd had to sew back together. About things she'd seen in the streets and in the public squares on the way to and from the former Presidential Palace. Then, with a deep breath, she'd asked what Asuka had seen in the last four years. Asked, with careful but doggedly persistent inquiry, if Asuka had endured anything similar.

但光找到了一个僻静的角落坐下，带着紧张而严肃的表情，向明日香讲述了前一天在唐·巴塞洛的地牢里所目睹的一切。关于那些遭受创伤、被摧残的女性，她不得不为她们缝合伤口。关于她在往返前总统府的街道和公共广场上所见的种种。随后，她深吸一口气，询问明日香过去四年里所见所闻。小心翼翼却执着地追问，明日香是否也经历过类似的苦难。

While some part of her did want to pour out a confession of all the horrors she'd seen, tolerated, or been subject to, Asuka very much did not want to reveal, even to her closest friend, the worst evils of that time. She told Hikari about the first six months, of chaos and hunger, of her being a barely-communicative wreck after the events of Instrumentatily and the Third Child somehow keeping them alive until Winthrop had appeared on the scene and somewhat stabilized things. She mentioned that Winthrop had… separated her and Shinji, and that had been the last time she'd seen him until they were reunited in Berlin just before the coup.

尽管她内心的一部分确实渴望倾诉所目睹、忍受乃至遭受的所有恐怖，但明日香极不愿意向最亲密的朋友透露那段时期最恶劣的罪行。她向光讲述了最初六个月的混乱与饥饿，以及自己在第二次冲击和第三适格者事件后几乎无法交流的状态，还有第三适格者如何设法让他们存活，直到温思罗普出现并稍稍稳定了局势。她提到温思罗普曾将她和真嗣分开，那也是她最后一次见到他，直到政变前夕在柏林重逢。

Hikari had clutched Asuka's hand then, sympathizing over how hard it must have been to be separated from Shinji like that, seeing how close they were now. Asuka had been unable to contain a dark, bitter laugh at that. Hikari's eyes had widened as Asuka recounted how she had latched on to Winthrop as a protector, how Shinji had simply vanished as far as she knew, and how she'd spent the next three years blaming him for it, and cursing him for leaving her.

那时，光紧紧握住了明日香的手，同情地想到她与真嗣分离的痛苦，毕竟他们现在如此亲密。明日香对此却发出了一声阴郁而苦涩的笑。光惊讶地睁大了眼睛，听着明日香讲述她如何将温斯洛视为保护者，真嗣在她所知中如何消失无踪，以及接下来的三年里，她如何责怪他，咒骂他抛弃了自己。

She'd been unable to stop. She'd told Hikari about her final battle. Of her desperate, solitary defense of the Geofront against an entire division of JSSDF troops. Of her impossible, bloody, magnificent berserkergang against the nine Mass Production Evas. And of how it had all been for nothing in the end, as they simply stood back up again, took to the skies, dove down on her pinned Eva like the Harpies she always remembered them as, and tore her apart. Of how she could feel everything as they ripped her Eva apart.

她无法停止讲述。她向光描述了那场最终的战斗，她孤身一人为保卫第三新东京市地底都市而对抗日本自卫队一个师团的绝望抵抗；她以不可能、血腥而又壮丽的狂战士姿态迎战九台量产型 EVA；以及这一切最终化为泡影，那些 EVA 再次站起，飞上天空，如她记忆中的哈耳庇厄般俯冲下来，将她那被束缚的 EVA 撕成碎片。她能感受到它们撕裂她 EVA 的每一刻。

How Shinji had never come. Until she was dead.

直到她死去，真嗣也未曾来过。

Hikari had stared at her in mute horror, eyes and mouth wide O's of shock. Her expression stayed that way as Asuka poured out how she'd seen, during Instrumentality, what had been happening inside the Eva cages during all that. Of how while she'd been fighting for her life and the lives of everyone at NERV, calling for Shinji to come help her, to save the day like he always did, Shinji saw Misato die and simply… crumbled, folding up into a weeping ball of misery on the catwalk overlooking the Bakelite-encased Unit-01. Leaving Asuka to fight and die alone… with her mother.

光呆滞地盯着她，眼中满是惊恐，嘴巴张成了震惊的 O 形。在明日香倾诉她在人类补完计划中所目睹的一切时，她的表情始终如此——关于在 NERV 所有人为了生存而战斗之际，她呼唤真嗣前来相助，期待他如往常般拯救世界，而真嗣却目睹了美里之死，心碎地蜷缩在俯瞰着被 Bakelite 包裹的零号机的高架走道上，化作一团悲泣的痛苦。留下明日香独自战斗，直至孤寂地与母亲共赴黄泉。

Hikari had frozen at this. Asuka's reminder of how the Evas really worked, and why no one in their class had a living mother had brought her friend close to tears of pain and rage. Asuka had finally run down, explaining in ashen tones how even as close as she and Shinji had become, and how yes, he had confessed that he loved her and she had accepted, even claimed him as hers and hers alone… that she still hated him for the betrayal that cost her and her mother's soul their existence.

光在这番话前愣住了。明日香提醒她关于 EVA 的真相，以及为何班上无人拥有在世的母亲，这让她几乎泪流满面，痛苦与愤怒交织。明日香终于说完了，她用苍白的语气解释，尽管她与真嗣的关系变得多么亲密，尽管他确实向她表白了他的爱，而她也接受了，甚至宣称他是她一个人的……但她仍然憎恨他，因为那场背叛让她和母亲的灵魂失去了存在的意义。

"I even told him to his face last night, Hikari. He knows and he knows why. I hate him. But I don't want to. It would be simpler if I did. There's still so much to forgive," she'd wearily finished.

她疲惫地结束了这段话：“昨晚我甚至当面告诉了他，光。他知道，也知道原因。我恨他。但我并不想这样。如果我真的恨他，事情反而简单了。还有太多需要原谅的地方。”

"But… but… Asuka, the way you two look at each other! You're hardly ever not holding hands or near each other! And… and… I haven't seen a kiss that passionate outside of a movie! Are you sure you don't love him?" Hikari had protested.

但是…但是…明日香，你们俩对视的眼神！你们几乎无时无刻不手牵手或彼此靠近！还有…还有…我还没在电影之外见过那么激情的吻！你确定你不爱他吗？”光抗议道。

"I don't know." 我不知道。

Hikari had visibly bit down on asking 'You don't know?', for which Asuka was grateful. "Asuka, watching you two together… you look like I want Touji and I to look, like just being together makes you happy. And you said… I mean… if you don't love him, how can you… um…" Hikari had blushed furiously. "How can you be sleeping together for real?!"

光明显地忍住了没有问出“你不知道吗？”这让明日香感到庆幸。“明日香，看着你们俩在一起的样子……就像我希望我和东治能有的样子，仿佛只要在一起就感到幸福。而且你说过……我是说……如果你不爱他，你怎么能……呃……”光的脸红得厉害。“怎么能真的睡在一起呢？！”

"I… he loves me, Hikari. He… I… I don't want to hate him! And when he actually looks at me like that, and comes out of his shell to reach for me… I can feel how much he loves me. It's like… like my blood's on fire, and everywhere he touches me just lights up. His hands can do the most amazing things to me… and when we kiss, I never want to stop. After the ball, we went back to our cabin and… and he was looking at me. He'd been looking at me like that all evening. Really looking at me. No one looks at me like that, Hikari, like I'm some kind of… wonderful person." Asuka's face had darkened. She'd taken a breath and gone on. "I… I told him I want him to stay with me. I asked him to promise me he'd never leave me. He did. And then…" she trailed off, an unfocused look and warm smile spreading across her face.

我…他爱我，光。他…我…我不想恨他！当他真的那样看着我，从他的壳里走出来向我伸手时…我能感受到他有多爱我。就像…就像我的血液在燃烧，他触碰我的每一处都亮了起来。他的手能给我带来最奇妙的感受…而当我们接吻时，我永远不想停下来。舞会后，我们回到小屋，他…他那样看着我。整个晚上他都那样看着我。真正地看着我。没人那样看我，光，好像我是某种…美妙的人。明日香的脸色变得阴沉。她深吸了一口气，继续说道：“我…我告诉他我想让他留在我身边。我请求他承诺永远不会离开我。他答应了。然后…”她停了下来，脸上露出一种失焦的温暖笑容。

Hikari had been increasingly leaning forward, her face flushed. When Asuka had paused, she'd nearly fallen off her seat. "And?! And?!"

光的脸色越来越红，身体不由自主地前倾。当明日香停顿时，她差点从座位上摔下来。“然后呢？！然后呢？！”

"And it was… good. Really good. Like 'I can't believe I get to do this every night from now on' good," Asuka had said with a grin.

“而且这感觉……很棒。真的非常棒。就像是‘我简直不敢相信从今往后每晚都能这样’的那种棒，”明日香笑着说道。

Hikari had blushed furiously, but nevertheless pelted her friend with questions, demanding all the details. Her eyes had widened when Asuka smugly held her hands apart to demonstrate a key measurement. And again when Asuka described the next night. "Three times?!"

光的脸涨得通红，但仍然不停地向朋友抛出问题，要求了解所有细节。当明日香得意地双手比划出一个关键尺寸时，她的眼睛瞪大了。而当明日香描述第二晚的情形时，她再次震惊：“三次？！”

Asuka had nodded, even more smug. "In the first hour."

明日香点了点头，更加得意地说：“就在第一小时。”

"The first hour?!" Hikari's eyes lost their focus and a faint smile had appeared on her lips.

"第一个小时？！" 光的眼神失去了焦点，唇边浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑。

Asuka brought her back down to Earth. "Hey, stop imagining my…" She'd managed not to stumble on the phrase, but only just. "…my boyfriend's… special features. He's mine. You've got your own pet Stooge to play with."

明日香把她拉回了现实。“嘿，别再幻想我……”她好不容易才没让那个词卡壳，“……我男朋友的……特别之处。他是我的。你也有自己的宠物呆子可以玩。”

"But I wasn't! …ok, maybe I was. But he's so nice and cute, too, Asuka! You're so lucky to have him!" Hikari had gushed. "I always knew you two liked each other!"

但我真的没有！……好吧，可能有一点。但他又好又可爱，明日香！你真幸运能拥有他！" 绫波激动地说道，"我一直知道你们俩互相喜欢！"

"Yeah… lucky." The amusement drained out of her. 'You do not deserve him' in Ayanami's voice echoed through her head again, this time in stereo with her own darkness. "I… needed him to promise me that, Hikari. I… don't want him to… decide I'm not who he thinks I am, sometime in the future."

"嗯……幸运。" 她脸上的笑意消散了。"你不配拥有他"，绫波的声音再次在她脑海中回响，这次与她内心的阴暗面形成了立体声。"我……需要他向我承诺，光。我……不想他将来某一天……决定我不是他所认为的那个人。"

Hikari's smile faded as she observed her friend's darkening mood. "What are you talking about, Asuka?"

光观察到朋友情绪变差，笑容也随之消失。“你在说什么呢，飞鸟？”

"I… it wasn't as bad as what you saw yesterday, in Berlin. Not quite. But… they used to do… ugly things to 'subversives' and such. In the public squares. I… learned not to complain. I'd already sold my body and soul to monsters for my own safety, what was I to care about someone else's? I…. I looked the other way on a lot of terrible things. I spent three and a half years acting…acting like I did when I stayed with you, after the 15th Angel. I compromised my every moral sense in the name of fear and…weakness. And one of the things that made me hate Shinji even more when he finally came to Berlin is that he...hadn't. He was still horrified at people being buried alive in Boston, or broken on wheels in the market. I just looked away and told him 'Oh, yeah. They do that here.'" She'd wrapped her arms around herself and rubbed her upper arms. "I defended Winthrop's regime to him. I justified it. I sold my soul to the biggest thug on the block to save my own skin… I sold my soul… and he didn't. He gave money to a starving beggar, and then took him on as a teacher since he'd been a philosophy professor. He got the family addresses of subversives being hauled off by the secret police so he could send their families money. He… never stopped thinking the world shouldn't be like this. He never accepted all the evil. I did. He was a better person… than me. And I'm afraid one day he'll wonder what he's doing with someone like me. Someone who did accept all that. So I needed him to promise me…" She'd suddenly had to swallow against a throat that wanted to close up.

我……那并不像你昨天在柏林看到的那样糟糕，不完全一样。但是……他们过去常常对“颠覆分子”之类的人做些丑陋的事情。在公共广场上。我……学会了不去抱怨。为了自身安全，我早已将身体和灵魂出卖给了怪物，别人的事我又何必在意呢？我……我对于许多可怕的事情都视而不见。我花了三年半的时间，表现得……就像我与你同住时那样，在第十五使徒之后。我以恐惧和软弱之名，一次次妥协了自己的道德底线。而当真嗣最终来到柏林时，让我更加憎恨他的一点是，他没有妥协。他仍然对波士顿活埋人或市场里车轮刑感到震惊。我只是转过头去，告诉他：“哦，是的。这里就是这样的。”她双臂环抱自己，摩挲着上臂。“我为温思罗普的政权辩护，我为其正名。我为了保全自己，将灵魂出卖给了街区里最大的恶霸……我出卖了灵魂……而他没有。他给了一个饥饿的乞丐钱，并因为他曾是哲学教授，便请他做自己的老师。 他获取了那些被秘密警察逮捕的颠覆分子家庭的地址，以便能给他们的家人寄钱。他……从未停止思考世界不应如此。他从未接受所有的邪恶。我接受了。他是个比我更好的人……我担心有一天他会疑惑自己为何与像我这样的人在一起。一个接受了这一切的人。所以我需要他向我承诺……"她突然间不得不咽下喉咙想要闭合的冲动。

"Asuka…" Hikari had seemed at a loss for what to say. "Has… has he ever said anything that makes you think he'd ever hold it against you?" she finally asked.

"明日香……" 光似乎不知该如何开口。"他……他有没有说过什么，让你觉得他会因此对你有看法？" 她终于问道。

She'd shaken her head. "No. Never. He's… like a Gottdamn Buddha like that. He just… lets it all go, somehow. He only ever blames himself for things. He lets me use him like an emotional punching bag sometimes. And yet, after all the pain between us, after all the times I've hurt him, he still… loves me." She'd looked up from her toes to meet Hikari's eyes again with a fragile smile. "I don't know why. And I still hate him for other things, but… he makes me happy. He's sworn to me he'll make up to me for everything he's ever done, like that fight in the Geofront. He says he'll do anything for me, even turn into his father if it means saving me. I want him with me until he keeps those promises."

她摇了摇头：“不，永远不会。他就像个该死的佛陀那样。他只是……不知怎么地，让一切都过去了。他只怪自己。有时候，他让我把他当作情感的出气筒。然而，尽管我们之间有过那么多痛苦，尽管我无数次伤害了他，他依然……爱我。”她从脚尖抬起头，再次迎上光的眼神，露出一丝脆弱的微笑：“我不知道为什么。我仍然因为其他事情恨他，但……他让我快乐。他向我发誓，会弥补他所做的一切，就像在 Geofront 的那场争吵。他说他愿意为我做任何事，哪怕是变成他父亲，只要能救我。我希望他留在我身边，直到他兑现那些承诺。”

Hikari had still looked troubled, but put on a determinedly positive face. "Asuka, you and he have had a connection since the day you showed up in school. If after this many years of all the horrible things you've been through, and he's still with you, I don't think anything is going to make him leave your side. It… sounds like the bigger problem is in your heart. Shinji doesn't think you're a bad person. I don't think you're a bad person. I don't think Touji or Aida-san or Katsuragi-san or Kaji-san do either. You're…" Hikari had looked at her feet for a moment, trying to put her concern for her friend into the right words. "You're being the hardest on yourself. And if you were a heartless person, you wouldn't be feeling bad about what you think you did wrong. I… it helped me, yesterday, when I talked to Doctor Leibshott about the things I saw. Have you done that?"

光仍然显得有些困扰，但努力摆出了一个坚定的积极表情。“明日香，你和他从你第一天出现在学校起就有了联系。经历了这么多年的苦难，如果他依然在你身边，我想没有什么能让他离开你。这……听起来你内心的困扰才是更大的问题。真嗣不认为你是坏人。我也不认为你是坏人。我相信东治、相田先生、葛城小姐或加持先生也不会这么认为。你……”光低头看了一会儿自己的脚，试图将她对朋友的关心用恰当的话语表达出来。“你对自己最苛刻。如果你是一个无情的人，你就不会因为自认为做错的事而感到难过。我……昨天和莱布肖特医生谈论我所见的事情时，对我有所帮助。你有没有这样做过？”

Asuka had snorted. "Wondergirl seems to think I'm a bad person. But she can go to Hell if she thinks her disapproval is going to make me... give... him… up." She'd drifted to a halt as the implications of her declaration had hit her. Ayanami's disapproval didn't dissuade her in the least, in fact it added to her determination, but even if it hadn't been a factor at all, she'd have felt the same way. She did. She wanted him to stay with her. Not just for keeping his promises, not just for the admittedly very nice pleasures they shared in bed, but because she wanted him there. She wanted baka-Shinji with her. Because he accepted everything about her. He really loved her. 'Why? Why does he…' She felt her hands shaking, and squeezed them into fists to still them.

明日香嗤之以鼻：“那个冰山美人似乎觉得我是个坏人。但她要是指望她的反对能让我放弃……他……”她的话戛然而止，因为意识到自己宣言的含义。绫波的反对丝毫没有动摇她，反而坚定了她的决心，即便这根本不是影响因素，她的感受也不会改变。她确实如此，她希望他留在自己身边。不仅仅是为了遵守承诺，也不仅仅是为了他们床上确实美妙的欢愉，而是因为她渴望他在。她想要笨蛋真嗣陪伴左右。因为他接纳了她的一切。他是真心爱她。为什么？为什么他……’她感到双手在颤抖，于是紧握成拳以平复它们。

She had been saved from trying to articulate her realization to Hikari or having to answer the question by a call on her interface band from said doctor, asking them to round up the other Pilots and meet in the command pit for the promised briefing on the origins of Code Dragonfly. But the thought had not left her, even after they'd returned to the ship. She'd laid on the bed thinking, letting Shinji's playing once again soothe her as she pondered. She'd been deep enough in thought in had taken her quite a while to notice Shinji was just as absorbed, his eyes focused a thousand miles beyond their cabin's walls, instead of his usual eyes-closed manner when he was really focused on what he was playing.

她本要向光表达自己的领悟，或是回答那个问题，却被那位医生通过界面带打来的电话所救，让他们召集其他飞行员，到指挥坑参加关于龙飞代码起源的预定简报。但这个念头并未随他们返回飞船而消散。她躺在床上沉思，任由真嗣的演奏再次抚慰心灵，陷入深思。过了许久，她才注意到真嗣同样沉浸其中，他的目光穿透了舱壁，遥望千里之外，而非像往常那样闭眼专注地演奏。

He'd proved again to be really thinking hard about what he could do to make himself into the confident, determined man she'd seen him be when it really mattered in an Entry Plug. 'I don't have any doubt about loving you… I am going to be the hero you want by your side.'

他再次证明了自己确实在深思熟虑，思考如何让自己成为她在插入栓中真正关键时刻所见的那种自信、坚定的男人。我对你毫无保留地爱着……我将成为你身边所期望的英雄。

Asuka rolled onto her side and stared at his sleeping profile. Four years ago, he wouldn't have been able to even frame the thought, much less say it out loud, and she'd have laughed cruelly or screamed abuse at him if he had. A month ago… he wouldn't have had the guts to say anything like that. And she'd still probably have screamed at him in bitter fury anyway. Now… when he said it, he said it with the expression and tone of voice she'd only ever seen him use during a mission in an Eva. He had none of the doubt, fear, or hesitation that he had always displayed when it came to interacting with her. And he'd sworn to never leave her side until she said he could go. But the idea of him not sleeping next to her was almost physically painful, now. The idea of him being by her side only because of his promise was almost as frightening. He wanted to be there now, but would actually being there change his mind? Every time they'd spent more than a few minutes together in the past had resulted in one of them hurting the other some way. Every time he'd tried to reach out to her before now she'd hurt him, usually deliberately. Even when he'd saved her life and then surprisingly tried to talk to her, she'd just lashed out, wanting to hurt him, hurt him as much as he was hurting her by making her keep going. To hurt him like he'd hurt her too many times by too many betrayals of her hopes and unspoken entreaties to really see her, the real Asuka behind the mask she always wore in fear of anyone she might love leaving her like Mama had and…

明日香侧身躺着，凝视着他熟睡的侧脸。四年前，他连想都不敢想，更别说大声说出来了，如果他真的说了，她要么会残忍地嘲笑，要么会恶毒地辱骂。一个月前……他也没有勇气说出那样的话。而她可能依然会出于痛苦的愤怒对他大吼大叫。现在……当他这么说时，他用的表情和语气，是她只在驾驶 Eva 执行任务时见过的。他不再像以往与她互动时那样，表现出任何的疑虑、恐惧或犹豫。并且他发誓，除非她允许，否则永远不会离开她身边。但现在，想到他不在身边入睡，几乎感到身体上的痛苦。想到他只是因为承诺而留在她身边，同样令人恐惧。他现在确实想在那里，但实际的相处会改变他的想法吗？过去每次他们在一起超过几分钟，总会以某种方式伤害对方。在此之前，每当他试图接近她，她总是伤害他，通常是故意的。 即便他曾救她一命，且出乎意料地试图与她交谈，她却只是猛烈反击，想要伤害他，就像他让她坚持下去那样深深地伤害她。像他无数次背叛她的希望和未曾言说的恳求那样伤害他，让她无法真正看到她，看到那个总是戴着面具的真正的明日香，因为害怕任何她可能爱上的人会像妈妈那样离她而去……

'Gott damn it, Sohryu, knock it off!' She halted yet another depressive spiral dead in its tracks. ''You're allowed to be happy now.' A fucking goddess said it to you. Your own future self said it to you. Why can't you believe it?'

该死的，惣流，别再这样了！' 她及时阻止了又一次的消沉情绪。'你现在有权快乐。一个他妈的女神这么对你说了。你未来的自己也是这么对你说的。为什么你就是不信呢？'

Because once Shinji started to understand how ugly and worthless she was inside, he'd be gone as soon as she released her hold on him, if he still even felt bound to keep his promise to someone who'd only ever lashed out at him.

因为一旦真嗣开始明白她内心的丑陋和无价值，一旦她松开对他的束缚，他就会立刻离开，如果他仍然觉得有必要遵守对一个只会向他发泄的人的承诺的话。

'Not this time. Not anymore. 'There Is No Such Thing As Fear', Gott damn it. I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I am tired of being ruled by my fears. I've spent every fucking day of the last sixteen years afraid I was going to die alone and unloved by anyone. I have had enough of that. He loves me. He's finally said it to my face and I damn well believe him. I have felt it. I know it. He knows almost every sin I've committed, even the ones against him, and if he thinks I'm worthy of that love then I believe him.'

这次不行，再也不会了。'恐惧根本不存在'，该死的。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我厌倦了被恐惧支配。过去十六年里的每一天，我都害怕自己会孤独终老，无人爱怜。我受够了。他爱我。他终于当面对我说了，我绝对相信他。我感受到了，我知道。他几乎了解我所犯下的每一个罪行，包括那些针对他的，如果他认为我值得这份爱，那我就相信他。

Then he's just as big an idiot as you've always called him. Even if he doesn't just leave you, this is a war. He could be dead tomorrow. You let him into your heart, when he goes away it will destroy you. And nothing will end that pain but the sweet release of death.

那他跟你一直骂他的那样，也是个十足的傻瓜。即便他不只是离开你，这可是战争。他明天就可能丧命。你让他走进了你的心，他一走，你就会被摧毁。除了死亡那甜蜜的解脱，没有什么能结束这痛苦。

'And we could both get hit by a bus tomorrow! If… wait, no, we couldn't get hit by a bus tomorrow! Shinji won't die tomorrow. I know in six month's he'll be with me because I've already seen it! I tell myself to walk through that portal! I know how this ends! Wonderbitch can go fuck herself! Shinji and I are going to win!'

我们俩明天都可能被公交车撞到！如果……等等，不，我们明天不会被公交车撞到！真嗣明天不会死。我知道六个月后他会和我在一起，因为我已经看到了！我告诉自己要穿过那扇门！我知道这个结局！Wonderbitch 可以滚蛋了！真嗣和我将会胜利！'

It doesn't matter. You don't deserve him. You do not love him. You hate him. You don't even know if you know how to love anyone.

没关系。你不配拥有他。你不爱他。你恨他。你甚至不知道自己是否懂得如何去爱任何人。

Asuka clenched her hands harder and harder until she felt her nails biting into her palms as she silently screamed at her own darkness. 'I don't know if I know how to love him! I do know I don't want to hate him! If I hate him for his sins in the past then I will Gott damn well learn how to forgive him! I don't deserve him? Then I'll fucking well earn it! I don't want to hate him, I want to love him!'

明日香越握越紧，直到感到指甲深深嵌入手掌，她无声地对着自己的内心黑暗尖叫。我不知道我是否懂得如何爱他！但我确实知道我不想恨他！如果我因他过去的罪孽而恨他，那我他妈的就要学会如何原谅他！我不配拥有他？那我就他妈的要争取到！我不想恨他，我想爱他！'

Asuka's eyes went wide and she bolted upright in bed. Did she really just think that? She turned the thought over in her head a few times. She did. She really did. She wanted to make him feel the way he made her feel every time he said it to her. She didn't know how yet, but she knew she wanted it, and she had the will to do anything. The darkness rallied once more, trying to remind her that her whole life had been nothing but failures at every good thing she'd ever tried. That her every seeming triumph was always immediately followed by destruction, pain, and emptiness. That no one needed her for anything. That Shinji was a good person making himself into an even better one, while she'd literally gotten into bed with murderers, torturers, and psychotics. 'And he forgives me all that. No one needs me? He does. He said so. He ended the world rather than live without me. He'd burn down Heaven for me, he said. I want to make him happy. If he can face the pain of everything the world has beaten him down with and still believe he can be happy in the end, then I will not let him beat me in that either. I can face anything he can.' She felt a warm drip of blood trickle out past her fingers from where her nails had finally pierced the skin of her shaking fists. 'I choose this. I have everything I have ever wanted within my reach and I will grasp it. I want this and I will have it. I will no longer let myself be ruled by fear. I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I am not afraid!'

明日香的眼睛瞪得大大的，她猛地从床上坐起。她真的那么想了吗？她反复在脑海中思索着这个念头。她确实这么想了。她真的这么想了。她想要让他感受到他每次对她说话时她所感受到的那种情感。她还不知道该怎么做，但她知道自己渴望这样，并且她有决心去做任何事。黑暗再次聚集，试图提醒她，她的一生中尝试过的每一件好事都以失败告终。她的每一次看似胜利总是紧接着毁灭、痛苦和空虚。没有人需要她做任何事。而真嗣是一个好人，正在让自己变得更好，而她却与杀人犯、施虐者和精神病患者同床共枕。而他原谅了我这一切。没有人需要我？他需要。他是这么说的。他宁愿结束世界也不愿没有我而活。他说，他愿意为我焚烧天堂。我想让他快乐。如果他能面对世界给予他的所有痛苦，仍然相信自己最终能幸福，那么我也不会在这点上输给他。我能面对他所面对的一切。她感到一股温热的血滴从指缝间渗出，那是她颤抖的拳头因指甲终于刺破皮肤而流出的。“我选择这条路。我渴望的一切已近在咫尺，我将紧紧抓住。我想要它，我必将拥有它。我不会再让恐惧支配自己。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我无所畏惧！”'

The only sound in the dark cabin was the distant thrum of the ship's engines and her own panting breaths. Her pounding pulse roared in her ears, but her darkness… was silent. Asuka waited, tensed for another wave of self-hatred, but it did not come. Had she won? Her heartbeat slowly eased and her breathing steadied, but she got no answer. She fell back onto the mattress and let out a long breath. She unclenched her hands and looked at the dribble of blood in her palms, black in the dim cabin. 'On the honor of Asuka Langley Sohryu, sworn in blood. Ow.' She licked away the trails across her skin, and rolled back over to press her body up against Shinji's warmth. 'I will learn how to forgive. I will learn how to love. And I will learn how to become who I've already seen myself be.'She let herself finally relax. As sleep finally overtook her, she had one last thought that made her smile.

昏暗舱室中唯一的声响，是远处船只引擎的低沉轰鸣和她自己急促的呼吸声。她剧烈的心跳在耳边轰鸣，但她的黑暗……却是寂静无声。明日香等待着，紧张地准备迎接另一波自我厌恶的浪潮，但它并未到来。她赢了吗？心跳逐渐平缓，呼吸也稳定下来，但她没有得到任何答案。她倒回床垫上，长长地呼出一口气。她松开紧握的双手，看着掌心在昏暗舱室中显得漆黑的一抹血迹。以碇真嗣之名，以血起誓。'她舔舐掉皮肤上的血痕，翻身再次贴近真嗣的温暖。我将学会如何宽恕。我将学会如何去爱。我将学会成为那个我已目睹自己成为的人。'她终于让自己放松下来。在沉睡最终征服她之前，她脑海中闪过最后一个念头，让她露出了微笑。

'I hate waiting. I wonder… How long it will be before he asks me?'

我讨厌等待。我在想……他还要多久才会问我呢？

### Chapter 32 Worth Losing Sleep Over No More Fear

Asuka groaned as the buzzing alarm of her interface band woke her. She gave real thought to just ripping it off and flinging it across the cabin. Only the realization that it would make it harder to hit the snooze button stayed her hand. She blinked her eyes open to find herself still firmly wrapped around Shinji from behind. She carefully let go and rolled away onto her back to stretch. 'Mmmm…I could get used to waking up like this.'

明日香呻吟着，被接口手环的嗡嗡闹铃声唤醒。她真想一把扯下手环，扔到船舱的另一头。但想到这样会让自己更难按下贪睡键，才忍住了冲动。她眨了眨眼，睁开眼睛，发现自己依然紧紧地从背后抱着真嗣。她小心翼翼地松开手，翻身仰面躺下，伸了个懒腰。'嗯……我可能会习惯这样醒来。'

Once again she'd awoken from a sleep free of nightmares, feeling energized, warm, and content. This was a lot better than the month before, where she'd always carefully kept a distance between herself and Shinji as they slept, and had tried to hide her tears and whimpers in her sleep. It was far, far better than the years before. Winthrop would sometimes have a hard, cold grip on her arm in his sleep, preventing Asuka from even rolling away to go clean herself off in the shower. She didn't sleep at all, those nights. Jinnai had been better than Winthrop, but only in comparison. Even so, it had been a relief to be in his…care, after Winthrop had finally tired of her and her increasingly poorly hidden relief when he could no longer 'rise to the occasion' towards the end. Jinnai's own… odd tastes had still kept it from being much better.

她再次从无梦的睡眠中醒来，感到精力充沛、温暖而满足。这比上个月好多了，那时她总是小心翼翼地与真嗣保持距离入睡，并试图在睡梦中隐藏自己的泪水和呜咽。这远比之前的岁月要好。温思罗普有时会在睡梦中紧紧抓住她的手臂，冰冷而坚硬，让明日香甚至无法翻身去浴室清洗自己。那些夜晚，她根本无法入睡。神谷比温思罗普好一些，但也只是相对而言。即便如此，在温思罗普终于厌倦了她，以及她越来越难以掩饰的当他无法“振作”时的解脱感之后，能得到神谷的“照顾”也算是一种慰藉。然而，神谷自己的……奇特癖好，仍让情况没有太大改善。

Now? Now was even better than the days before the Third Impact when a weekend rolled in. Asuka didn't even want to get out of bed. She wanted to just pull the covers back over the both of them, cuddle in, and go back to peaceful sleep. 'Gott, I really do want to cuddle him. I like just having him hold me.' She looked over at her slowly stirring bedmate with a smile, and poked him in the side. "Oy. Wake up, Third. Time for some delicious ship breakfast slop."

现在？现在甚至比第三次冲击前的周末还要美好。明日香甚至不想起床。她只想把被子重新拉过头顶，依偎在一起，回到宁静的梦乡。“天哪，我真的想抱抱他。我喜欢他就这样抱着我。”她微笑着看向床上渐渐醒来的同伴，轻轻戳了戳他的侧腰。“喂，醒醒，第三。该吃美味的船上早餐糊了。”

Shinji opened his eyes reluctantly, but smiled back at her once he did. "Good morning to you too." As he sat up next to her, his eyes caught the small bloodstains on the sheets left from her midnight battle. "Oh. Um…did we do that?" He twisted and tried to look over his own shoulder at his back. There were more than a few sets of marks on his back. "I didn't think you drew blood, quite."

真嗣不情愿地睁开眼睛，但一看到她便回以微笑：“你也早安。”他坐起身来，目光落在床单上她午夜战斗留下的点点血迹上。“哦。呃……是我们弄的吗？”他扭动身体，试图回头看自己的背。背上确实有不少伤痕。“我没想到你会弄出血来，真是。”

Asuka grinned at the wicked memory. She had been a little energetic last night. Mere pleasure hadn't been the only reason Shinji gave a scream or two. She knew better where that blood had come from, though. She looked at her hands and squinted at them in slight surprise. There was no sign of any cuts on her palms. There was a little blood dried under her nails and on the skin of her hands, but no apparent place it had been drawn from. Weird. "Um, yeah, that must have been it," she replied after a moment's confusion. 'I didn't dream that part, did I? Guess I just thought I cut them more than I did or something.' She looked back up and smiled at him. "Must have been. After all, nothing happened after that last night, did it?"

明日香回想起那邪恶的记忆，不禁咧嘴一笑。昨晚她确实有些精力过剩。真嗣那一两声尖叫，可不仅仅是因为快感。至于那血迹的来源，她心里清楚得很。她低头审视自己的双手，微微眯起眼睛，略感惊讶。手掌上并无任何割伤的痕迹。指甲下和手部皮肤上虽有些干涸的血迹，却找不到明显的出血点。真是奇怪。“嗯，应该是这样吧，”片刻迷茫后，她回应道。‘那部分我没做梦吧？可能我以为自己割得比实际更深或者怎样。’她抬头望向他，微笑着。“肯定是的。毕竟，昨晚那之后什么也没发生，不是吗？”

Shinji shrugged and stopped trying to look at his back. He did look at her a little suspiciously at her uncharacteristically cheery demeanor. "Asuka, what is it?"

真嗣耸了耸肩，不再试图看自己的背。他确实有些怀疑地看了她一眼，因为她那不同寻常的欢快态度。“明日香，怎么了？”

She rolled her eyes at him, but still kept smiling. "Typical Baka-Shinji. I fight and win a literally bloody battle against my inner demons, and you sleep right through it."

她朝他翻了个白眼，却依旧保持着笑容。“典型的笨蛋真嗣。我与内心的恶魔进行了一场血淋淋的战斗并取得胜利，而你却一觉睡过去了。”

His eyebrows rose. "What?"

他眉毛一挑，“什么？”

She stretched again and got out of bed. "I'll tell you later. Get dressed. We need to be seen by the scurvy crew of this tub before we get out of here. And I think its time we tell them to just start leaving breakfast and dinner trays at the door so we don't have to keep to this time zone's clock as much." She kept the grin on her face as she dug out some clothes for breakfast. 'Of course, not explaining that is going to bake his brain for a bit. This will be fun.'

她再次伸了个懒腰，从床上爬起来。“待会儿告诉你。快穿衣服。我们得在这破船的那些讨厌船员面前露个脸，然后才能离开这里。我想是时候让他们把早餐和晚餐托盘直接放在门口了，这样我们就不用非得按这个时区的时间来。”她一边翻找着早餐要穿的衣服，一边保持着脸上的笑容。‘当然，不解释这一点会让他脑子转不过弯来。这可真有趣。’

Changing into their uniforms before they returned to Buenos Aires delayed them only a minute. Asuka was still smirking at a still puzzled Shinji when they transported into the command pit hand-in-hand to find a haggard looking Touji and an only slightly less tired-looking Sergeant Bir nursing steaming cups of coffee, with Kensuke staring at them quizzically.

换上制服再返回布宜诺斯艾利斯只让他们耽搁了一分钟。当他们手牵手传送进指挥坑时，明日香仍在对一脸困惑的真嗣窃笑，却发现东治面容憔悴，而中士比尔也略显疲惫，正捧着热气腾腾的咖啡，而健介则好奇地盯着他们。

"What happened to you two?" Shinji asked after neither even looked up at them. Kensuke shrugged.

"你们俩怎么了？" 真嗣问道，因为两人甚至都没有抬头看他们一眼。健介耸了耸肩。

"Lieutenant Liebshott," grumbled Sergeant Bir.

"利布肖特中尉，"比尔警官嘟囔道。

"Hikari," Touji mumbled. "光," 冬二喃喃道。

They both looked up from their cups to stare at each other with matching confused looks.

他们俩从各自的杯子上方抬起头，用同样困惑的表情互相凝视。

"Really?!" Kensuke blurted at Touji, eyes going wide. "Dude!"

"真的假的?!" 健介冲着徹二脱口而出，眼睛瞪得老大。"老兄！"

Touji blushed furiously. "Not like that! She kept me up all night just holding on to me and crying a bit, talking about the stuff she saw yesterday, and how horrible it must have been for Shinji and the Red Demon!"

冬二满脸通红，急忙解释：“不是那样的！她整晚都紧紧抱着我，边哭边讲述昨天看到的可怕事情，还有真嗣和红魔的遭遇一定很恐怖！”

"Oh... sorry," Kensuke winced apologetically. "Is that what happened to you, Sergeant Bir?"

"哦...对不起，" 健介歉意地皱了皱眉，"这就是您遭遇的事情吗，比尔中士？"

"No," the Imperial growled, looking back to his coffee and taking a sip.

"不," 帝国君主低吼一声,转头啜了一口咖啡。

"Then what...?" "那然后呢...？"

Bir raised his head and gave Kensuke a long, flat stare.

比尔抬起头，向健介投去长久的、毫无波动的凝视。

Kensuke stared back at him for a minute, then turned red. "Oh," he said meekly.

健介盯着他看了一会儿，然后脸红了。“哦，”他怯生生地说。

Bir put his hand over his eyes for a moment and sighed. Lowering his hand, he nodded to Shinji and Asuka. "Good morning, commanders. Nothing elsesignificant to report for the night."

比尔用手遮住眼睛片刻，叹了口气。放下手后，他向真嗣和明日香点头致意。“早上好，指挥官们。昨晚没有其他重要事项报告。”

Already fighting down a grin, Asuka couldn't resist a tease. "Just a bit worn down, are you, Sergeant?"

已经忍不住要笑出来的明日香，还是忍不住调侃了一句：“只是有点疲惫了，是吧，中士？”

"Lady's half my age and apparently doesn't need to sleep." He craned his neck until it popped. "Somehow I'll endure." He eyed them. "There's blood under your fingernails, ma'am. Should I call one of the medics to check on Lieutenant Ikari? Lieutenant Horaki, maybe?"

"女士年纪只有我的一半，显然不需要睡觉。" 他伸长脖子直到发出咔哒声。"不管怎样，我会坚持下去。" 他打量着他们。"夫人，您的指甲下有血迹。需要我叫一名医护人员来检查一下碇中尉吗？或许堀木中尉？"

'How the Hell did he spot that? It's not super bright in here and I haven't brought my hands up,' she wondered. Aloud, she replied, "Ah, no, that's quite alright, Sergeant. Shinji is not as frail as he might look. He'll be alright." Return fire, with a grin. "Are you likewise injured?"

她心中疑惑：“他到底是怎么发现的？这里并不算太亮，我也没把手举起来。”她大声回答道：“啊，不，完全没问题，中士。真嗣并不像看起来那么脆弱。他会没事的。”她带着一丝笑意反击道：“您也受伤了吗？”

Bir acknowledged the sally with a tip of his coffee cup. "I'm an old soldier, ma'am. Plenty of previous battle scars. I'll march on."

比尔举起咖啡杯微微示意，回应了这番调侃。“我是个老兵，女士。身上有的是过往战斗的伤痕。我会继续前行的。”

Kensuke looked between them with a confused look before he worked it out. His mouth dropped open when he did, and he shot a look at Shinji like he was about to say something. Shinji just gave him a 'don't ask' look and shook his head. He closed his mouth with a snap, and looked back and forth between Shinji, Touji, and Sergeant Bir. "Man, I have got to find me a girlfriend," he eventually muttered.

健介来回打量着他们，一脸困惑，随后恍然大悟。他嘴巴惊讶地张大，随即向真嗣投去一个似乎要说什么的目光。真嗣只是回以一个“别问”的眼神，并摇了摇头。健介啪地一声合上嘴巴，目光在真嗣、亨和比尔中士之间来回扫视。“唉，我得赶紧找个女朋友了。”他最终嘟囔道。

Sadly not on cue for the still-unattached Stooge, Ching picked that moment to walk in the door from the hallway with her own steaming mug of coffee, singing cheerfully. "With a rebel yell, she cried m-…Oh, good morning, Lieutenant Sohryu, Lieutenant Ikari." In contrast to Sergeant Bir and Touji, Ching was bright-eyed and cheery. Her gaze sharpened as she took a better look at the pair of Pilots. "You had a good night, I see. You especially, Lieutenant Sohryu. I'd love the story later."

可悲的是，就在这个尚未脱单的斯图奇还没来得及反应的时刻，青恰巧从走廊推门而入，手里端着自己那杯热气腾腾的咖啡，欢快地唱着歌。“随着一声叛逆的呐喊，她喊出了……哦，早上好，碇中尉，惣流中尉。”与贝尔中士和东治形成鲜明对比的是，青目光炯炯，神采奕奕。她仔细打量着两位驾驶员，眼神变得锐利起来。“看来你们昨晚过得不错。尤其是你，惣流中尉。我很期待稍后听听你们的故事。”

Asuka wanted to talk to Ching about it too. "It's a good one. Later. What's on for today?"

明日香也想和青谈谈这件事。“这是个好主意。待会儿再说。今天有什么安排？”

"Us removing Don Barceló and his crew of not-so-merry men has won us a lot of credit with the man on the street, it seems. We've got people lining up to work for us. We're doing really well in digging up former administrators, doctors, and other critical skills among the population of the city to set up our own provisional government structure. Turns out, not being brutal thugs and rapists makes you more popular. Who knew?" Ching dryly reported. "And there's already a pretty good crowd starting to gather for this evening. Lieutenant Horaki and her platoon of medics are doing tons of work already. The Supply platoon is handling feeding everyone, and they're screening the crowd for medical skills as well. Give us a week, and we should have at least one of the city hospitals back in operation. The city power grid is back online too. The people really like that part." She took a spot at the side of the table and waved for Bir to take over.

我们除掉唐·巴塞洛及其一伙并不怎么快乐的部下，似乎赢得了街头民众的广泛赞誉。现在，人们纷纷排队想要为我们工作。我们正在这座城市的人口里挖掘前行政人员、医生以及其他关键技能的人才，以建立我们自己的临时政府结构。事实证明，不成为残暴的暴徒和强奸犯会让你更受欢迎。谁会想到呢？”青干巴巴地报告道，“今晚已经有一大群人开始聚集了。堀木中尉和她的医疗小队已经忙得不可开交。补给小队负责为所有人提供食物，同时也在人群中筛选具有医疗技能的人。给我们一周时间，我们应该能让至少一家城市医院恢复运营。城市电网也已重新上线。人们真的很喜欢这一点。”她在桌子旁边找了个位置，挥手示意比尔接手。

Sergeant Bir put aside his coffee and brought up the area map on the battle table. "We're pushing out to Rosario, Bolivar, and Dolores today. Lieutenant Suzuhara will fly escort for the southern group, Lieutenant Aida the northern one. Lieutenants Kaji and Kasturagi are going to be busy in the city and in the towns we cleared yesterday setting up administration until this afternoon, then they'll be here to help with the concert. You'll be on standby for the western group if we need you, but we don't expect anything as tough as yesterday's mission in La Plata. We'll want you here to get ready for the concert and show you around to the crowd."

比尔中士放下咖啡，在作战桌上展开区域地图。"今天我们将推进至罗萨里奥、玻利瓦尔和多洛雷斯。铃原中尉将为南部小组提供空中护航，相田中尉负责北部。卡吉中尉和葛城中尉将在昨天清理过的城市和乡镇忙于建立行政机构，直至下午，随后他们将回来协助音乐会。若西部小组需要支援，你将待命，但我们预计不会像拉普拉塔昨天的任务那样艰巨。我们希望你留在这里准备音乐会，并向人群展示一番。"

"Show us around to the crowd?" Shinji asked, a little uncomfortable.

"带我们到人群中去吗？" 真嗣问道，略显不安。

"You two are the commanders of this circus, and there's got to be some people left around who remember you both as the Eva Pilots who fought the Angels to defend the world," Ching pointed out. "These people have had their whole world turned inside out and stomped on for years, and been viciously brutalized for a lot of that. They need a symbol, something to rally around and look up to as we rebuild this place as a functioning civilization again. And that means you two are going to have to be marquee-level faces of the renaissance." Ching grinned as Shinji less than happy about the idea. "Sorry, Lieutenant Ikari, but we're going to make you two into planetary heroes."

你们俩是这个马戏团的指挥官，肯定还有人记得你们曾是驾驶 EVA 对抗天使、保卫世界的驾驶员。"青指出，"这些人多年来世界被颠覆践踏，遭受了无数残酷的折磨。他们需要一个象征，一个能团结他们、让他们仰望的标志，以便我们重建这个文明社会。这意味着你们俩将成为复兴运动中的招牌人物。"青笑着看向并不乐意的真嗣，"抱歉，碇中尉，但我们要把你们打造成行星英雄。"

Asuka elbowed him in the side. "Didn't you just promise me you were going to become the hero and such? Hmm? This is the perfect chance, baka," she said just loud enough for him to hear.

明日香用手肘顶了顶他的侧腹，“你不是刚答应我要成为英雄之类的吗？嗯？这可是绝佳机会，笨蛋，”她故意提高音量，刚好让他听见。

Shinji still didn't look terribly happy with the idea. "I've never been very good in front of crowds, Ching."

真嗣对这个主意似乎仍不太满意。“我从来就不擅长在人群前表现，青。”

Ching wasn't letting him wriggle away. She tilted her head at him and said, "Maybe not, but I know you're a damn good cellist, and so in tonight's concert, during the intermission where we explain who we are and what we're doing here, the highlight is going to be you playing as much awesome cello music as you can pump out. The crowd is already going to be fired up from the music and all the psi work we're going to be doing to make sure everyone hears it in their native language, so they'll really pay attention to you, and lock in the idea that you're the symbol of the fight to reclaim the world."

青可没打算让他溜掉。她歪着头对他说：“或许不是，但我知道你是个了不起的大提琴手，所以今晚的音乐会上，在我们中场休息时介绍我们是谁、来这里做什么的时候，亮点将是你尽可能多地演奏出精彩的大提琴曲。观众们已经会因为音乐和我们确保每个人都能用母语听懂的意念工作而兴奋不已，他们会特别关注你，从而牢牢记住你是夺回世界之战的象征。”

"You're good at three things, Shinji; Piloting an Eva, cooking, and playing a cello. You know how to do this," Asuka told him. 'Come on, Shinji. You can do this.' She bit down on a laugh as another thought occurred to her. 'Ok, he's also really good at another thing, but I'm not mentioning that one in public or suggesting it for a stage performance!'

“你擅长三件事，真嗣：驾驶 Eva、烹饪和拉大提琴。你知道该怎么做，”明日香对他说。“来吧，真嗣，你能行的。”她忍住笑意，另一个念头闪过脑海。“好吧，他还有一项特别擅长的事，但我绝不会在公开场合提及，更不会建议它作为舞台表演！”

Shinji swallowed, but took a deep breath and nodded just a little. At least this he knew he could do well. Doing it in front of a crowd was a new thing, but he knew music. "O-okay. I will. I know at least one person in the audience will enjoy it." His expression steadied a bit after he looked at her and squeezed her hand. Asuka sternly kept the foolish smile that wanted to break out on her face under control. "I know some solo pieces, but I'll need at least a piano or violin for accompaniment on anything more elaborate."

真嗣咽了咽口水，深吸一口气，微微点头。至少这件事他知道自己能做好。在众人面前表演是新鲜事，但他对音乐了如指掌。“好，我会上的。我知道至少有一位观众会喜欢。”他看向她，握紧她的手后，表情稍微镇定了些。明日香努力控制着想要在脸上绽放的傻笑，严肃地保持镇定。“我记得一些独奏曲目，但如果要表演更复杂的曲目，我至少需要钢琴或小提琴伴奏。”

Ching and Sergeant Bir nodded. "We'll find you some backing. Live preferably, that's better than recorded, but we can arrange that if we need," Ching said.

青和伯尔中士点头同意。“我们会给你找些支持。最好是现场的，那比录制的要好，但如果需要，我们也能安排录制。”青说道。

Asuka stiffened slightly as a crazy idea popped into her head. 'Oh, no. No way. Don't even think it, Sohryu. This is not a good idea. You haven't even touched one in years.' Her heart started to pound faster nevertheless. What better way to start her new life of not being afraid then doing something crazy? Help out Shinji and get a chance at an adoring crowd cheering her… both of them?

明日香心头一紧，一个疯狂的念头突然闪现。'哦，不。不可能。别想了，惣流。这可不是个好主意。你已经好几年没碰过那东西了。'尽管如此，她的心跳还是加速了。还有什么比做些疯狂的事来开启她不再恐惧的新生活更好的方式呢？帮助真嗣，并有机会让一群崇拜者为他们欢呼……他们俩？

"My cello's back on the ship. Should I go get it?" Shinji asked.

我的大提琴还在船上。我应该去取吗？”真嗣问道。

Ching nodded. "Now's as good a time for it as any."

青点了点头。“现在和任何时候一样，都是个好时机。”

Shinji looked at her. "I'll be right back, Asuka."

真嗣看着她。“我马上回来，明日香。”

She nodded. "Yeah…I, ah, wanted to talk to Ching alone for a bit anyway." She still let go of his hand only reluctantly.

她点了点头。“嗯……我，呃，本来就想和青单独聊一会儿。”尽管如此，她还是依依不舍地松开了他的手。

Shinji steped back over to the transport pad, touched his wristband, and vanished.

真嗣再次退回到传送平台上，轻触手腕上的带子，随即消失不见。

Asuka turned back to face Ching and took a deep breath of her own. "Let's talk. And can you find me a violin?"

明日香转过身来面对青，自己也深吸了一口气。“我们谈谈吧。还有，你能帮我找一把小提琴吗？”

Part 61 第 61 章

No More Fear 不再恐惧

Ching blinked at her for a second, then grinned like a shark. "Oh, you did have a good night." She glanced at the transport pad. "He'll be back in just a moment, and I'm betting that this talk's going to need longer than that." She looked over the Sergeant Bir. "Top, tell him we've gone off for a little chat, and have someone escort him to the stage area for a sound check. We'll catch up with him there when we're done."

青眨了眨眼，随即露出一抹狡黠的笑容。“哦，看来你昨晚过得不错。”她瞥了一眼传送台。“他马上就回来，但我敢打赌，这次谈话的时间会比那更长。”她扫了一眼比尔军士长。“头儿，告诉他我们去聊一会儿，派个人带他去舞台区做声音检查。我们谈完了就去那里找他。”

Bir nodded. "Sumus Nocentibus Via, ma'am. And 'Beat Navy'."

伯尔点头道：“Sumus Nocentibus Via，女士。还有‘打败海军’。”

"Not in the last 12 years, you haven't." Ching waved for Asuka to follow and headed for the door.

"过去 12 年里，你可没有。" 晶挥手示意明日香跟上，然后朝门口走去。

Asuka chewed on the Latin for a second. "'We are harm's way'?" she asked Ching.

明日香咀嚼了一下这句拉丁语。“'我们是伤害之道'？”她问程。

Her friend grinned. "The motto of the Imperial Navy. We're not 'First In Harm's Way,' we are harm's way. And he also threw in the traditional annual rugby taunt. Cute. His way of saying he had fun last night too."

她的朋友咧嘴一笑：“这是帝国海军的座右铭。我们不是‘首当其冲’，我们就是危险本身。他还顺带提了传统的年度橄榄球挑衅。挺可爱的。他这是在说他昨晚也玩得很开心。”

"And yet you both don't even call each other by name?" Asuka inquired. "Even Shinji and I did that almost right from the start, before we were even anything."

"然而你们俩甚至都不互称名字吗？" 明日香问道。"就连真嗣和我，几乎从一开始就这样做了，那时我们什么都不是。"

Ching quirked an eyebrow at her. "And you spent how long calling him 'Third Child' every chance you got, hmm? We're on duty, we keep it professional. Off duty is our own affair. We're both adult enough to keep our professional and personal lives carefully delineated. Making sure I don't start calling him 'my cute little fanboy' or something while we're working is a good idea towards that," Ching said crisply as they headed down the hall.

青挑眉看向她：“你之前逮着机会就叫他‘老三’，叫了多久来着？工作时我们保持专业。下班后的事我们自己处理。我们都是成年人，能清楚区分工作和私生活。确保我在工作时不叫他‘我的可爱小粉丝’之类的，对维持这种区分是有好处的。”青边说边沿着走廊走去。

"'Fanboy'? What, is he a closet otaku or something?"

"‘粉丝男孩’？啥意思，他是个隐藏的宅男还是怎么的？"

"Pretty much. He really admires the Emperor. He's a devout TrueBorn, born on Avalon itself in one of the Crown Personal Domains, no less, and he's doing his third enlistment in the Army as an NCO because that's the way His Majesty did it back in his time. He even started in the Armor Corps too. He nearly blew a fuse he was so excited when he heard he was getting tasked with a mission for one of His Majesty's personal friends. Getting to meet him in person and get orders from him face to face was better than his birthday, he said."

差不多。他真的很崇拜皇帝。他是个虔诚的真生人，就出生在阿瓦隆的一个皇室私人领地，而且他正在陆军中第三次服役，担任非委任军官，因为这是皇帝陛下当年走过的路。他甚至也是从装甲部队开始的。当他听说自己被指派执行皇帝陛下一位私人朋友的任务时，他激动得差点跳起来。他说，能亲自见到他并面对面接受命令，比过生日还要好。

"Sounds like you two did a good bit of talking, if you know all that about him after one night," Asuka said slyly.

"听起来你们俩聊了不少，一夜之间就对他了解这么多，"明日香狡黠地说。

Ching stuck her tongue out at her. "And my bedtime adventures with Sergeant Tightpants, while fun, are not what we're sneaking away from your boyfriend for. You are lit up like a bloody lighthouse, Asuka. Your aura and every line of your body language are totally different story than yesterday." They'd reached a small patio near the still empty and derelict tennis courts. Ching picked out a table with two good chairs and sat them down. She ostentatiously interlaced her fingers and placed her hands together under her nose in a mocking imitation of Commander Ikari's favorite intimidation pose. "Talk."

青对她吐了吐舌头。“还有我和紧身裤中士的睡前冒险，虽然有趣，但并不是我们背着你的男朋友偷跑的原因。你简直亮得像个灯塔，明日香。你的气场和身体语言的每一丝变化都与昨天截然不同。”他们来到了一个靠近空荡废弃网球场的小露台上。青挑了一张有两把好椅子的桌子，坐了下来。她夸张地交叉手指，将双手放在鼻子下方，模仿碇司令最喜欢的威慑姿势，嘲弄地说：“说吧。”

"Jawohl, Frau Doktor!" Asuka mocked right back. "Alright, last night I was… um…" 'Ok, how do I even begin to explain this...'

"遵命，博士女士！" 明日香立刻反唇相讥。"好吧，昨晚我……呃……" '天哪，我该怎么开始解释这一切……'

"Clawing your name into Shinji's back? I can smell the blood under your fingernails," Ching said with a small grin.

“在真嗣背上刻下你的名字？我能闻到你指甲下的血腥味。”青带着一丝冷笑说道。

"No!" Asuka rolled her eyes. "Well, maybe. I… wait, you can smell it?"

"不！" 明日香翻了个白眼，"好吧，也许。我……等等，你能闻到？"

Ching tapped her nose. "Better than a bloodhound. You're also covered in his scent and lots of specific pheromones. So you two had fun last night? Good, you both deserve that as much as you can get. But if that's not why you have blood under your nails, what's the story? You're a lot happier than yesterday about something."

青轻敲自己的鼻子。“比猎犬还灵。你身上也满是他的气味和许多特定的费洛蒙。看来你们俩昨晚玩得很开心？很好，你们能得到的都值得拥有。但如果指甲下的血迹不是因为这个，那又是什么故事？你比昨天开心多了，肯定有什么事。”

'These people are still strange. Is that how Sergeant Bir noticed it? By smell? Guess I should have showered.' "I am. Ok, let me back up some. Yesterday, after we got back, Hikari dragged me off for what I thought was just going to be some girl-talk about what sex was like. She wanted to talk about that, but also about… the last four years."

这些人还是那么陌生。难道 Bir 警官是通过气味察觉到的？早知道应该洗个澡。"我是这么想的。好吧，让我从头说起。昨天，我们回来后，Hikari 拉着我，我以为只是要聊聊关于性的事情。她确实想谈那个，但还想谈谈……过去四年的事。"

Ching had dropped the Commander Ikari imitation and sat back, regarding Asuka with a calm, open expression. "I imagine that didn't give her the answers she expected," she said.

青已经放弃了模仿伊卡里指挥官，向后一靠，用平静而坦诚的表情看着明日香。“我想那并没有给她预期的答案，”她说。

Asuka stared at her hands. Even in the light of the tennis court's few working light sets, she could see tiny traces of dried blood. "No, it didn't."

明日香凝视着自己的双手。即便在网球场上几盏尚能工作的灯光下，她仍能看见细小的干涸血迹。“不，并没有。”

Asuka marshaled her thoughts and tried to start at the beginning; Shinji's terror he'd felt at possibly being like his father. His declaration to her and plea for her to be his moral anchor against that. How devoting himself to her and making himself into a hero for her made him feel like he had on the beach that first morning on Avalon. "And I know I'd do almost anything to feel like that beach again. That the Third Child is ready to kill, burn, or turn into his father if it means protecting me… He said he was ready to burn down Heaven for me, Ching. I… I can't even manage to say what my own feelings between us are. He's… consciously making himself into a better man, and I'm…" She trailed off, waving her hands helplessly in front of her. 'And I still can't admit out loud how reassuring it was and how good it felt when he came back from running off and just held me.'

明日香整理思绪，试图从最初开始；真嗣对于可能变得像他父亲那样的恐惧。他对她宣告并恳求她成为他对抗那一切的道德支柱。他如何全心投入于她，为她成为英雄，这让他感觉如同在阿瓦隆第一个早晨的海滩上。“我知道我几乎愿意做任何事，只为再次感受那种海滩上的感觉。第三适格者已准备好为了保护我而杀人、焚烧，甚至变成他父亲……他说他已准备好为我焚毁天堂，青。我……我甚至无法表达我们之间我自己的感受。他……在有意识地让自己成为一个更好的人，而我……”她话音渐弱，无助地挥动着双手。‘而我仍无法大声承认，当他跑开后回来紧紧抱住我时，那感觉是多么令人安心和美好。’

"Kind of intimidated and don't know how to respond since you're not sure of what you feel?" Ching offered.

"有点被吓到了，不知道该怎么回应，因为不确定自己的感受吗？" 青提议道。

Asuka nodded. "I… I can't talk to him about it, he's the cause. I can't talk to Hikari about it, either. There too much about the last four years I still don't ever want to have to tell her. She tried to ask me about it yesterday, after the mission." Asuka gave a dark laugh. "She was so sympathetic about how hard it must have been for Shinji and I to be apart. I told her what I was really thinking during that time. Then I just kind of unloaded on her, telling her how I hated him for betraying me, for letting me die alone…and for not selling his soul to monsters like I did. I was feeling…not totally deserving of someone like him." She carefully looked up, already expecting Ching to tell her it was okay because she had no choice, waving away her conflict. Instead she just saw Ching watching her carefully, an intently focused look on her face.

明日香点了点头。“我……我无法和他谈论这件事，他就是起因。我也不能和光谈论，关于过去四年的太多事情，我仍然永远不想告诉她。昨天任务后，她试图问我。”明日香发出一声阴郁的笑。“她对真嗣和我分开时所承受的艰难表示同情。我告诉了她我当时真正的想法。然后我就一股脑地向她倾诉，告诉她我多么恨他背叛我，让我孤独地死去……还有他没有像我那样出卖灵魂给怪物。我当时感觉……自己并不完全配得上他。”她小心翼翼地抬头，已经预料到青会告诉她没关系，因为她别无选择，挥手驱散她的矛盾。然而，她只看到青正专注地注视着她，脸上带着一种极其集中的表情。

"You made those choices under severe conditions, but you did make them, however much you might regret them now," she said. "Like I said on our flight, you're going to have to forgive yourself, since you're the one holding it against you. I'm not going to say something trite like 'it's okay, you did what you had to,' because you are obviously feeling the full weight of those choices right now. Shinji is a good guy, and you're still very worried that he'll decide you're not who he thought you were, that he could do better, and leave you, aren't you?"

你在极其艰难的情况下做出了那些选择，但无论如何，你确实做出了选择，尽管你现在可能后悔不已。正如我在飞行途中所说，你必须原谅自己，因为正是你自己对此耿耿于怀。我不会说些陈词滥调，比如‘没关系，你做了你该做的’，因为你现在显然正承受着那些选择带来的全部重压。真嗣是个好人，你仍然非常担心他会认为你不是他所想的那个人，担心他觉得能找到更好的而离开你，对吗？

Asuka bit down on a spike of fear at hearing that idea out loud. "I… I don't want his promise to be the only thing keeping him with me, because… because I want him with me. I won't give him up, not for Wondergirl, not for anyone. He loves me and makes me happy. I don't even know why he does." She drew aimless patterns in the dirt on the table's surface. "When we got back to the fleet last night, he was playing his cello for me, and I noticed he was staring into space while he played. If he's thinking about what he's playing, he closes his eyes, so this was something else. I asked, and he was seriously thinking… about how he could use his love for me as a fulcrum to remake himself, using me as his fixed point of certainty…He was choosing who he wanted to be. For me." She shook her head. "Then he gave me a math textbook in a whole new field I'd never heard of and played for me some more while I dove into it. He started to laugh when he finished. When I asked him why, he said that being with me, making me happy, was what he'd always wanted, that it was even better than sex to him."

听到那个想法被大声说出来，明日香咬紧牙关，一股恐惧涌上心头。“我……我不想他的承诺成为他留在我身边的唯一理由，因为……因为我希望他是因为爱我而留下。我不会放弃他，不会为了 Wondergirl，也不会为了任何人。他爱我，让我快乐。我甚至不明白他为何如此。”她在桌面上随意地划着泥土的图案。“昨晚回到舰队后，他为我拉大提琴，我注意到他演奏时眼神空洞。如果他在思考演奏的内容，他会闭上眼睛，所以这一定是别的什么。我问了他，他认真地思考着……如何利用对我的爱作为支点，以我为确定不变的中心，重塑自我……他在选择自己想要成为的人。为了我。”她摇了摇头。“然后他给了我一本我从未听说过的全新领域的数学教科书，又为我演奏了一会儿，而我则沉浸其中。当他演奏结束时，他笑了起来。我问他为什么笑，他说和我在一起，让我快乐，是他一直以来的愿望，甚至比性爱还要美好。”

Ching raised an eyebrow. "Really? He keeps hitting harder on the emotional side than the physical, doesn't he?"

青扬起眉毛。“真的吗？他似乎更倾向于在情感上施压，而非身体上的，不是吗？”

Asuka nodded without meeting Ching's eyes. "He's… he's always been like that. He'd always look away from me when I tried flirting with him physically, back before… even last month, when I made sure sex was explicitly offered as part of our arrangement, but not emotional involvement from me, he always… I know he wants my body, but it was always far more frightening that he wanted my heart, black as it is…" She shook her head to break that train of thought. "No, none of that. Anyhow, when he said that, I... ahem!" She fought down the burning blush that started heating her cheeks. "I told him to be ready for a lot more of that anyway, since I'd decided I liked it."

明日香没有直视青的眼睛，点了点头。“他……他一直都是那样。以前我试图用身体挑逗他时，他总是避开我的目光，甚至在……上个月，我明确提出性关系是我们协议的一部分，但不涉及我的情感投入，他总是……我知道他渴望我的身体，但他更渴望我那颗漆黑的心，这总是更让我害怕……”她摇了摇头，打断了这个思绪。“不，别提那些了。总之，当他那么说时，我……咳！”她努力压下开始在脸颊上燃烧的红晕。“我告诉他要做好准备，因为无论如何，我已经决定我喜欢那样。”

Ching laughed and shook her head. "I shouldn't laugh. It's funny, but I'm really glad to hear you do. It wouldn't have been too surprising to a lot of people if you'd sworn off sex forever after what you lived through. I'm glad you've managed to reclaim your own body and pleasure. And sharing it with someone you want to share it with is an even greater one, isn't it?"

青笑了笑，摇摇头：“我不该笑的。这很好笑，但我真的很高兴听到你这么说。经历了你所经历的，如果你发誓永远放弃性，对很多人来说也不会太惊讶。我很高兴你已经重新掌控了自己的身体和快乐。而且与你想与之分享的人分享，更是如此，不是吗？”

Asuka snorted. "I don't plan on stopping anytime soon, that's for sure. Turns out the Third Child is good at more than Piloting and playing a cello. And after I said that, we were a little busy for the next couple hours. Afterwards…is what I wanted to talk to you about."

明日香哼了一声。“我可没打算很快停下来，这是肯定的。没想到第三适格者不仅擅长驾驶和拉大提琴。而且我这么一说，接下来的几个小时我们都有点忙。之后……这就是我想和你谈的。”

Ching just nodded at her. "Go on."

青只是向她点了点头。“继续。”

Asuka took a deep breath to steady herself. "I couldn't sleep. Shinji crashed really fast, but I kept staring at the ceiling and thinking over what Hikari said, and what I said. I really was ready to spit in Wondergirl's face and tell her Shinji was mine forever, no matter what she said. No matter what anyone said. Because I wanted him there. I wanted… I want him with me. He accepts everything about me. But…" She ground to a halt.

明日香深吸一口气，稳住心神。“我睡不着。真嗣很快就睡着了，但我一直盯着天花板，反复思考着光说的话，还有我自己的话。我真的准备好了要朝那个奇迹女孩脸上吐口水，告诉她真嗣永远是我的，不管她说什么。不管任何人说什么。因为我希望他在那里。我希望……我想要他和我在一起。他接受我的一切。但是……”她突然停了下来。

Ching narrowed her eyes as Asuka's silence lengthened. "He accepts everything about you…that he knows about. You're worried he's not going to like it when he finds out things you haven't told him, aren't you? Like Winthrop."

静的眼神随着明日香的沉默而变得锐利。“他接受了你所告诉他的一切……你担心当他发现你未曾提及的事情时，他会不喜欢，对吗？比如温思罗普。”

Asuka winced. "Yeah. And that started a real nasty spiral… but this time I stopped it cold."

明日香皱了皱眉。“是的。那引发了一个真正的恶性循环……但这次我及时制止了它。”

Ching raised an eyebrow again. "Really? Go on…"

青又挑了挑眉。“真的吗？继续说……”

"I remembered who I am. I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I am tired of being afraid. So I fought. Shinji said he can use his total lack of doubt in loving me as the fulcrum to remake himself. I can use that too. I know he loves me. And I know just as well that in six months he and I are still together and happy because that's how I got here. I don't know what I feel about him right now. I want him with me, but I just as much hate him for the past. I hate him….but I don't want to. I don't want to hate him, Ching. I want to love him. I want to make him feel the way he makes me feel every time he says it. I don't know how, but I'm going to learn. I'm going to learn how to forgive him, forgive myself, and feel like I deserve all this, because I'm going to grab it and keep it. He needs me. And I n- want him." Asuka blinked as she finished. Her hands were clenched into tight, shaking fists again, and she was taking heaving breaths like she was about to jump out of a plane without a parachute. She raised her head to find Ching smiling at her.

我想起了自己是谁。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我厌倦了恐惧。所以我战斗了。真嗣说他能利用对我毫无保留的爱作为支点来重塑自己。我也可以利用这一点。我知道他爱我。我也同样清楚，六个月后我们仍然在一起，幸福着，因为这就是我来到这里的原因。我不知道我现在对他是什么感觉。我希望他在我身边，但我也同样憎恨他的过去。我恨他……但我不想这样。我不想恨他，Ching。我想爱他。我想让他感受到每次他说爱我时我的感受。我不知道怎么做，但我会学。我会学会如何原谅他，原谅自己，并感到我配得上这一切，因为我将抓住它并保持它。他需要我。而我——想要他。”明日香说完后眨了眨眼。她的双手再次紧握成颤抖的拳头，呼吸沉重得仿佛即将无伞跳出飞机。她抬起头，发现 Ching 正对她微笑。

"Hello, Asuka. Pleased to meet you," Ching said gently. "That's one Hell of a breakthrough, Asuka. Congratulations."

"你好，明日香。很高兴见到你，" 青轻声说道，"这真是一个了不起的突破，明日香，恭喜你。"

Asuka made her fists unclench. There were two angry red lines in her plams where her nails had been pressed in. She showed her palms to Ching. "Y-yeah. It was…that's how I got blood under my fingernails. When we woke up, Shinji saw the blood on the sheets, and made the same guess you did. I told him I'd fought and won a bloody battle against my inner demons, and he missed it. I still haven't explained that one to him."

明日香松开了紧握的拳头，掌心有两道因指甲压迫而留下的愤怒红痕。她向阿静展示手掌，“嗯，是的。那就是我指甲下有血迹的原因。我们醒来时，真嗣看到床单上的血迹，也做出了和你一样的猜测。我告诉他，我与内心的恶魔进行了一场血战并取得了胜利，而他错过了这场战斗。我至今还没向他解释清楚这件事。”

"And now you want to spring another surprise on him tonight? Ooh, you're having fun playing with poor Baka-Shinji's head, aren't you?" Ching grinned. "Really, congratulations, Asuka. You know what you want. And deciding that is the biggest step towards getting there. You know he wants you. All you have to do now is jump. Ready?"

现在你还想今晚再给他一个惊喜？哦，你玩弄可怜的笨蛋真嗣的脑袋玩得很开心嘛，不是吗？" 晶笑着说。"真的，恭喜你，明日香。你知道你想要什么。而决定这一点是通往那里的最大一步。你知道他想要你。你现在要做的就是跳。准备好了吗？

"Right. No such thing as fear." Asuka took another deep breath. "Let's go find me that violin."

"对，没有什么恐惧。" 明日香深吸一口气，"我们去找我的小提琴吧。"

### Chapter 33 Sound Check -Let There Be Rock 

Shinji carefully pushed the door to the command pit open with one hand, gently maneuvering his cello case through the opening with the other. He stopped short just inside the door, however. The room had a dismaying total lack of vibrant redheaded Pilots. Asuka suddenly disappearing had already been his waking nightmare for the last three and a half years. He didn't like anything that brought that feeling back. He looked to Sergeant Bir and his friends, who were still gathered around the battle table. "Umm… Segreant Bir, where did Asuka and Ching go? I was only gone for a minute."

小心翼翼地用一只手推开指挥掩体的门，另一只手则轻柔地引导着大提琴盒通过狭窄的入口。然而，刚一踏入室内，他便戛然而止。房间内令人沮丧地空无一人，不见那充满活力的红发驾驶员身影。过去三年半里，明日香突然消失已成为他挥之不去的梦魇。他不喜欢任何能唤起那种感觉的事物。他转向仍在战斗桌旁聚集的比尔中士和他的朋友们，问道：“呃……比尔中士，明日香和青去哪儿了？我才离开了一会儿。”

The NCO pointed with his coffee cup at the doors behind Shinji. "She said she needed to talk to Lieutenant Liebshott for a bit, and thought it might take a while, so they headed off to find somewhere a bit more private. They'll meet you once they're done at the stage area. Junior Private Tiangjin here will show you where you can set up and try a sound check." He waved at the Chinese soldier waiting by one of the communication stations they'd built into the room's sides. The soldier stepped forward with a polite nod to Shinji.

那位士官用咖啡杯指向真嗣身后的门说：“她说需要和利布肖特中尉谈一会儿，可能要花点时间，所以他们去找了个更私密的地方。谈完后他们会在舞台区和你汇合。这位下等兵天津金会带你去设置音响并进行试音。”他朝房间一侧通讯站旁等待的中国士兵挥了挥手。那士兵礼貌地向真嗣点头致意，然后走上前来。

Shinji hesitated. "Umm…" 'Come on, Ikari, you lasted over three years apart without dying. You can handle an hour or something.' "I guess so. Show me where, then."

真嗣犹豫了。“呃……”来吧，碇，你已经分开三年多了还没死。你撑得住一个小时左右的。”“我想也是。那带我去吧。”

The Private nodded and led Shinji out the doors holding them open to let Shinji guide his instrument through more easily. As Shinji got it through the doors and into the hallway, the Private said something in a rapid, complex language Shinji couldn't recognize. It wasn't Japanese, English, German, or even his tiny bit of Arabic, so he was lost.

一等兵点头示意，引领真嗣走出大门，并扶着门让真嗣更方便地引导他的乐器通过。当真嗣带着乐器穿过门进入走廊时，一等兵快速地说了一串真嗣无法辨识的复杂语言。那不是日语、英语、德语，甚至不是他仅知的那点阿拉伯语，因此他完全摸不着头脑。

They looked blankly at each other for a moment before the Private poked at his wristband for a second. He looked back up and Shinji and spoke again. A half-second behind his speaking, his wristband chimed in with clear Japanese. "Sorry, sir. Didn't realize you don't know Avaloni. I was asking if you'd like me to help you carry your instrument."

他们茫然地对视了一会儿，随后士兵轻触了一下自己的腕带。他抬头看向真嗣，再次开口。在他讲话的半秒后，腕带以清晰的日语同步响起：“抱歉，先生。没意识到您不懂阿瓦隆语。我是问您是否需要我帮您拿乐器。”

Shinji stared for a second. 'Yup, these people are still strange,' Asuka's voice said in his head. "Umm, yes, thank you."

真嗣愣了一下。'没错，这些人还是那么奇怪，'明日香的声音在他脑海中响起。"嗯，是的，谢谢你。"

The Private gently took the handle from Shinji's hand and carefully lifted it onto his own shoulder without apparent effort. "No trouble at all, sir. This way."

士兵轻柔地从真嗣手中接过把手，毫不费力地将其稳稳扛在肩上，说道：“一点也不麻烦，先生，这边请。”

The football pitch in the center of the stadium had been transformed while he and Asuka had been gone. Shinji marveled at the expanse of black plastic flooring that had been laid down to protect the grass, and the artfully arranged curtains, lighting, and sound support beams that had been set up to make the partially concealed Unit-01 look like part of the stage dressing. The main stage was set up between Unit-01's spread feet, with the grim stare of Unit-01's fearsome mask now angled down slightly to glare at the audience. A single chair sat in center stage, and Shinji seated himself as the Private set the case gently down beside him.

体育场中心的足球场在他和明日香离开期间已焕然一新。真嗣惊叹于保护草坪而铺设的广阔黑色塑料地板，以及巧妙布置的帷幕、灯光和音响支撑梁，这些让半遮半掩的初号机看起来如同舞台布景的一部分。主舞台搭建在初号机张开的脚间，其恐怖面具的冷峻目光此刻略微下倾，直视着观众。舞台中央孤零零地放着一把椅子，真嗣坐了上去，而那名士兵则轻手轻脚地将箱子放在他身旁。

"Anything else, sir?" his wristband asked, just behind his own speech.

"还有其他事吗，先生？" 他的腕带问道，声音紧随他自己的话语之后。

Shinji looked around at the otherwise empty stage as he opened the case and readied his cello. "Ah, if I'm supposed to do a sound check, can you tell the crew I'm ready? I don't see anyone."

新二环顾四周，舞台上空无一人，他打开琴盒，准备起他的大提琴。“啊，如果需要我做声音检查的话，能告诉工作人员我已经准备好了吗？这里没看到人。”

The Private turned and pointed to the distant control booth high on the side of the stadium near the midfield line. "They're up there, sir. Ready, Sergeant De Silva?"

士兵转过身，指向远处位于体育场中场线附近高处的控制室。“他们在上面，长官。准备好了吗，德席尔瓦中士？”

A sharp click sounded from the speakers around them. "All set here, Private. Directional and area mics green and ready, Lieutenant Ikari. You can start anytime and we'll equalize and balance as you go," boomed the speakers.

周围扬声器中传来一声清脆的咔哒声。“这里一切准备就绪，下士。定向和区域麦克风已绿灯就绪，碇中尉。您随时可以开始，我们会边进行边调整均衡和平衡。”扬声器中传来响亮的声音。

Shinji nodded. English this time. He could handle English. He brought up his bow and closed his eyes. Private Tiangjin backed away quietly as slow strains of Haydn began to fill the stadium.

真嗣点了点头。这次是英语。他能应付英语。他举起弓，闭上了眼睛。私人天金悄悄地退后，海顿的缓慢旋律开始充盈整个体育场。

Especially in Boston, playing had become his best form of meditation. It eased his heart, as much as anything could in a place where 'subversives' were buried alive by Winthrop's regime. And sometimes, when he was finishing, he could hear Asuka's honest, surprised applause, the one time she'd unpromptedly praised him for anything. 'Perserverance is power. I'm impressed,' she'd told him. He held on to that memory tightly during dark days….and the memory of his first kiss later that night. 'Damn it, Ikari. Why did you have to freeze up? Well, from now on, I swear I'm never going to miss another chance to hold her.' The weight of his sins seemed to vanish when she was in his arms. Everything was made right. Without her, nothing could ever be right. Shinji let himself get lost in the music and even better, more recent memories.

尤其在波士顿，演奏已成为他最佳的冥想方式。它安抚着他的心灵，在这温斯洛普政权下，“颠覆分子”被活埋之地，任何事物都难以做到如此。有时，当他演奏完毕，仿佛能听见明日香那真诚而惊讶的掌声，那是她唯一一次自发地赞扬他。“坚持就是力量。我佩服你。”她曾这样告诉他。在那些黑暗的日子里，他紧紧抓住这份记忆……还有那晚初吻的回忆。该死，碇，你为何要僵住？从今往后，我发誓绝不会再错过拥抱她的机会。当她在他怀中时，他的罪孽似乎烟消云散，一切都变得正确。没有她，一切都不可能正确。真嗣让自己沉浸在音乐中，以及更美好、更近期的记忆里。

He had no idea how much time passed before the sound of a single-member audience applauding snapped his eyes open. He eagerly looked around, a smile already breaking out on his face, but only spotted Ching, walking in from stage right.

他不知道过了多久，直到一位观众鼓掌的声音将他惊醒。他急切地环顾四周，笑容已不自觉地绽放在脸上，却只见青从舞台右侧走了进来。

"Not bad at all, Lieutenant Ikari! Bravo!" she cheered, stopping next to his chair. "You're quite good!"

相当不错嘛，碇中尉！太棒了！"她欢呼着，停在他的椅子旁。"你真的很厉害！"

"Its just practice. I've been playing a long time now. I'm no great talent at it," he demurred.

这只是练习而已。我已经玩了很长时间了。我在这方面并没有什么天赋，”他谦虚地说。

Ching cocked her head at him. "I just watched you flawlessly play two separate movements of Haydn's Cello Suite #1 in C Major from memory with no sheet music and your eyes closed. You call that 'no great talent'? Lord, you're a perfectionist!"

青凝视着他，歪了歪头。“我刚看到你闭着眼睛，不看乐谱，完美无瑕地演奏了海顿 C 大调第一大提琴组曲中的两个乐章。你竟然说这不是‘了不起的才华’？天哪，你真是个完美主义者！”

Shinji ducked his eyes away. Praise still felt awkward, even when he knew if he'd seen someone else do the same thing he have said it was impressive. A sudden flash of Asuka glaring at him ran through his head and an imaginary elbow to his side prodded him. Pushing himself, he managed to bring his head back up to meet Ching's eyes again. "Thank you. I try hard, and playing relaxes me." The Asuka in his head gave a marginally satisfied grunt.

真嗣垂下目光，即便明知若见他人有此表现，自己也会赞其出色，但面对赞扬仍感局促。脑海中突然闪过明日香怒视他的画面，仿佛有只无形的手肘轻推了他一下。他鼓起勇气，重新抬头迎上阿静的目光：“谢谢，我努力了，演奏能让我放松。”脑海中的明日香发出了一声略带满意的哼声。

Ching was staring at him thoughtfully. "You had your eyes closed," she said. "Hmm…She really looks at you, you know. No one else in this world knows you nearly so well."

青正若有所思地凝视着他。“你刚才闭着眼睛，”她说，“嗯……她真的很关注你，你知道的。在这个世界上，没有人比你更了解你了。”

"What? Who, Asuka?" Shinji blinked.

"什么？谁，明日香？" 真嗣眨了眨眼。

Ching gave him a sardonic smile. "No, the Queen of Spain. Yes, of course Asuka!" She rolled her eyes. "Who else? No wonder she calls you 'Baka-Shinji'."

绫波给了他一个讥讽的微笑。“不，是西班牙女王。当然是明日香！”她翻了个白眼。“还能有谁？难怪她叫你‘笨蛋真嗣’。”

Shinji didn't know whether to laugh or frown at that. He settled for looking behind Ching, searching hopefully for said redhead. "Where is she? Wasn't she talking to you? I thought you were going to meet me here when you finished talking."

真嗣不知道是该笑还是该皱眉。他决定朝青后面看去，满怀希望地寻找那位红发女孩。“她在哪儿？她不是在和你说话吗？我以为你们谈完就会来这里见我。”

"And so I have." Ching walked to the back of the stage to grab a folding chair and return to seat herself facing Shinji. "Asuka has a surprise she wants to hit you with later, but she needs the next several hours to get ready. So I figured it was a good time to come see you for a talk. After what I heard from Asuka, I think it's a good time for it."

"所以我就来了。" 青走到舞台后方，拿了一把折叠椅，回来后坐在了真嗣对面。"明日香准备了一个惊喜要稍后给你，但她需要接下来的几个小时来准备。所以我想这是个好时机来找你谈谈。从明日香那里听到的消息来看，我觉得现在正是时候。"

'She needs to see me for a 'talk'?' Shinji tried to still his apprehension, suddenly feeling like he'd been sent to the principal's office. "Um, what did she say?"

她需要见我进行一次“谈话”？' 真嗣试图平复自己的不安，突然感觉像是被叫到了校长办公室。“呃，她说什么了？”

Ching sat back and gave him a half-smile. "Relax, Shinji. You don't need to look like you're about to get chewed out by your teacher or something. And note I'm not calling you 'Lieutenant Ikari' here. This is your friend talking, not your XO. Asuka had a good night last night."

青往后一靠，对他露出了半笑。“放松点，真嗣。你不必看起来像是要被老师训斥似的。还有，注意我不是在这里称呼你为‘碇中尉’。这是你朋友在说话，不是你的副官。明日香昨晚过得不错。”

Shinji coughed and looked away, flushing red.

真嗣咳嗽了一声，转过头去，脸颊泛起红晕。

Ching laughed. "No, not that! After you fell asleep, Casanova. She did some thinking."

青笑了。“不，不是那个！你睡着后，情圣。她思考了一会儿。”

Shinji could still feel the heat in his cheeks, but made himself face Ching again. "Thinking about what? She said something about a 'bloody battle with her inner demons' this morning, but didn't explain."

真嗣仍能感觉到脸颊上的热度，但他强迫自己再次面对青。“在想什么？她今早提到了一场‘与内心恶魔的血战’，但没细说。”

"Oh, she'll tell you when she feels ready to. As both a doctor and a friend, I'm not going to break her confidence in me, nor would I do it to you. You two can tell each other what you feel comfortable with." She raised an eyebrow at him. "You could try asking her. Anyway, some of the things she said and how you reacted yesterday to things made me want to talk to you. You've had some unpalatable realizations about how you're a bit more like your father than you thought, yes?"

哦，她觉得时机成熟时自然会告诉你。作为医生和朋友，我不会辜负她对我的信任，对你也一样。你们俩可以相互分享自己觉得合适的事情。她朝他挑了挑眉。“你可以试着问问她。”她接着说，“昨天她的一些话和你对事情的反应让我觉得有必要和你谈谈。你已经意识到，自己比你想象的更像你父亲，对吧？”

Shinji silently nodded. He felt his stomach twist. He fought back, reminding himself that he wasn't going to become like his father. He wouldn't let himself, and Asuka would make sure. "I'm… like him. But I'm not him. I'm not going to let myself turn into what he did. And Asuka's going to help me."

真嗣默默地点了点头。他感到胃里一阵翻腾。他努力抵抗着，提醒自己不会变得像他父亲那样。他不会允许自己那样，而且明日香也会确保这一点。“我……像他。但我不是他。我不会让自己变成他所成为的样子。明日香会帮助我。”

Ching nodded approvingly. "It's good, having a reason, something to drive yourself with, isn't it? And something worth driving towards?"

青点头表示赞同。“有理由，有动力，是好事，对吧？还有值得为之努力的目标？”

"Yes… but… I hate it, but I can almost understand why my father did some of what he did, now. It's… frightening and liberating to think I'd do the same for Asuka," Shinji said slowly. "I… it almost feels like it would be hard not to do some things, even evil, if I had to. I must be more than a little evil at heart if that feels right to me. Just like him."

"是的…但是…我讨厌这样，但现在我几乎能理解父亲为何会做出那些事。想到我也会为了明日香做出同样的事，既令人恐惧又感到解脱，" 真嗣缓缓地说道，"我…这几乎让人觉得，有些事情，哪怕是邪恶的，如果必须去做，也难以抗拒。如果这感觉对我来说是正确的，那我内心一定也有不少邪恶，就像他一样。"

"His Majesty thought you might hit this feeling at some point. He told me to tell you, 'motivation means something'. That's why there's the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter or war. The 'why' means something. Remember why you are doing something, and if it's for her and you're worried if it's the right thing to do, think about what she would think of it." Ching leaned forward enough to pat his shoulder reassuringly. "And don't worry too much about being so-nasty-evil in your heart. The Lord and Lady would not be so firmly on your side if you were. They can See a lot deeper into your heart than we can with just our eyes."

陛下认为你迟早会触及这种感受。他让我告诉你，“动机意味着什么”。这就是为什么法律上区分谋杀与过失杀人或战争。“为什么”很重要。记住你做某事的初衷，如果是为了她，并且担心这是否正确，那就想想她对此会怎么看。”青倾身向前，安慰地拍了拍他的肩膀。“还有，别太担心内心那些所谓的邪恶。如果真是那样，主和夫人不会如此坚定地站在你这边。他们能看透你内心的深度，远超我们仅凭肉眼所能及。”

Shinji snapped upright in the chair, Ching's hand falling away as he sat back. "Them! You…they…Why didn't you tell me they were gods?! They're… they're real?!"

真嗣猛地从椅子上坐直，青的手随之松开，他向后靠去。“他们！你……他们……为什么你不告诉我他们是神？！他们……他们是真的？！”

Ching looked confused by his outburst. "I'm sorry, was that a secret? Asuka asked me about that in the first fifteen minutes. She didn't tell you?"

青对他的爆发感到困惑。“对不起，那是秘密吗？在最初的十五分钟里，明日香就问过我了。她没告诉你吗？”

"No! TJ… I mean, Lieutenant O'Brien did just yesterday!"

不！TJ……我是说，奥布赖恩中尉昨天刚做过！

Ching shrugged. "Maybe she thought you knew? The raising the dead and traveling through time and space wasn't a hint?

青耸了耸肩。“也许她以为你已经知道了？让死者复活，穿越时空，这还不算暗示吗？

"I…. but… I thought they were just… I don't know, really powerful with super-technology or something," Shinji said, his thoughts roiling. 'Asuka knew all along? Why didn't she say anything?'

"我……但是……我以为他们只是……我不知道，真的拥有超级科技之类的东西，" 真嗣说道，思绪翻涌。明日香一直都知道？为什么她什么也没说？

Ching made a calming gesture with both hands. "Easy, Shinji. I know it wasn't Asuka trying to hide things from you. Though there are still things she is still afraid to talk to you about."

清用双手做了一个安抚的手势。“放松，真嗣。我知道那不是明日香有意对你隐瞒。尽管她还有一些事情仍然害怕和你谈起。”

"Like what? Like last night? What did she think about?" Shinji asked.

"比如说？像昨晚那样？她当时在想什么？" 真嗣问道。

"No, last night I think she'll talk to you about soon, but you'll really have to ask her. I wanted to talk to you for your own sake. I know your relationship with your father is hmm… complicated, to put it mildly? And the recognition that you're more like him than you thought hit pretty hard yesterday, correct?"

不，我想她昨晚应该很快会和你谈这件事，但你真的得亲自问她。我找你谈话是为了你好。我知道你和你父亲的关系，嗯……说得好听点，挺复杂的吧？昨天你意识到自己比想象中更像他，这个打击挺大的，对吧？

Shinji closed his eyes for a moment and sighed. "Yes. But I think I know what I want to do about it. And I believe Asuka can help me do so."

真嗣闭上眼睛，叹了口气。“是的。但我想我知道该怎么做了。而且我相信明日香能帮我做到。”

Ching nodded. "That's good to hear, but still, I'm willing to bet you'll benefit from talking to me about it some. And with that in mind," Ching reached her right hand into her left cuff and pulled out a neat packet of wires that sprang out into a pair of round-rimmed glasses when she snapped her wrist. She placed them on her face and repeated the gesture with her left hand and right cuff to somehow produce a small pipe. She placed that in her mouth and blew a couple of bubbles out of it. "Zo, tell me about you fadda," she said with a terribly faked Vienna accent.

青点了点头。"听到这个真好，不过我敢打赌，跟我聊聊这事对你有好处。考虑到这一点，"青将右手伸进左袖口，抽出一捆整齐的电线，手腕一抖，电线便展开成一副圆框眼镜。她戴上眼镜，又用左手从右袖口变戏法似的掏出一个小烟斗。她把烟斗叼在嘴里，吹出几个泡泡。"那么，跟我说说你父亲吧，"她操着蹩脚的维也纳口音说道。

Shinji stared at her, and began laughing.

真嗣盯着她，然后笑了起来。

Shinji was no longer laughing several hours later, as he peered out through a gap in the curtains at stage left as the crowd poured in to the stadium floor and stands by the thousands. The offer of free food and medical care to the hungry, ill-treated masses of Buenos Aires had proved quite a draw. He remembered someone mentioning the stadium could hold as many as sixty eight thousand people at full set. The stage and Unit-01's 'throne' blocked of the stands behind them and cut into that, but he'd have easily believed there were at least fifty thousand people in front of him, waiting. He pulled back behind the curtains and looked at the people setting up the band gear. The drummer was the four-armed Marine that had come through the portal looking for Ching. Corporal… Vasraith, or something. 'Four arms will make him a really wild drummer, I think,' Shinji marveled. TJ was hooking up an electric guitar, and looked amazingly calm for a guy about to take the stage in front of such a huge crowd. 'I wish I was that calm. I feel like I'm about to throw up. Where is Asuka? All Ching will say is she's still working on her 'surprise', and will be here before I play.'

几小时后，真嗣不再发笑，他透过舞台左侧窗帘的缝隙向外窥视，只见成千上万的人群涌入体育场的地面和看台。向布宜诺斯艾利斯饥饿、受虐待的大众提供免费食物和医疗服务的提议，确实颇具吸引力。他记得有人提过，这个体育场最多能容纳六万八千人。舞台和初号机的“王座”挡住了他们身后的看台，减少了这一数字，但他相信眼前至少有五万人，正在等待。他退回窗帘后，看着人们搭建乐队设备。鼓手是那位四臂海军陆战队员，他曾穿越传送门寻找青。下士……瓦斯拉斯，或是类似的名字。我想，四臂会使他成为一个狂野的鼓手，真嗣惊叹道。TJ 正在连接电吉他，面对即将在如此庞大的人群前登台，他显得异常冷静。真希望我也能如此镇定。我感觉自己快要吐了。明日香在哪里？青只说她仍在准备她的“惊喜”，会在我演奏前到达。

Ching walked up past him to talk to TJ. She was going to be playing announcer tonight. "I'm good at public speaking. Plus, a lady like me in a slinky dress can pitch anything," she'd told him earlier. Shinji had to admit, the glittery, deep blue backless dress she'd donned did look nice. He tugged at the collar of his own uniform. The full-dress setting they'd used for the ball was more than fancy enough for a concert, and Ching had recommended it anyway, as they were going to be highlighting his and Asuka's role in the Angel War as part of promoting them as heroes to rally around.

青走向 TJ，准备与他交谈。今晚她将担任播报员。“我擅长公开演讲，而且像我这样的女士，穿上贴身的裙子，能推销任何东西，”她之前这样告诉他。真嗣不得不承认，她穿的那件闪亮的深蓝色露背裙确实很漂亮。他拉了拉自己的制服领口。他们为舞会准备的这套盛装，对于一场音乐会来说已经足够华丽，而且青也建议使用，因为作为宣传的一部分，他们将突出真嗣和明日香在天使战争中的角色，以此来塑造他们成为值得围绕的英雄。

Shinji ran over the plan for the concert again in his head. After Misato had finally stopped laughing during their first briefing, Ching had explained why they were bothering to mount something as odd as a rock concert in the beginning stages of a military campaign. Simply put, they needed to communicate their mission and get a large number of people on their side in a hurry, and this was the easiest way of doing so short of directly manipulating peoples' minds, which Ching and Sergeant Bir firmly emphasized was something Avaloni just Did Not Do to civilians. Screwing with an enemy's head was acceptable, in the same way as shooting at them was permissible and likewise not for noncombatants. With Gendo's history of concealing everything from them on her mind, after brief consideration Asuka had decided full honesty was the way to go, and they were going for full disclosure of the Imperials' otherworldly nature in the presentation in the middle of the concert that Ching would give. The harmonics and psi field TJ and the entire Psi platoon would be putting out wouldn't alter the audience's thinking, but would make them feel the full emotional weight and sincerity of Ching's presentation, as well as allow everyone to hear it in their native language and increase the kick everyone got from the music.

真嗣在脑海中再次回顾了音乐会的计划。在第一次简报中，当美里终于停止大笑后，青解释了为何要在军事行动初期费心举办一场摇滚音乐会。简而言之，他们需要迅速传达使命并争取大量民众支持，而这是除直接操控人们思想之外最简便的方法，青和伯尔中士坚决强调，阿瓦隆尼人绝不对平民进行此类行为。扰乱敌人心智如同向其开火一样可接受，但同样不适用于非战斗人员。考虑到源堂过去对他们隐瞒一切的历史，经过短暂思考，明日香决定采取完全诚实的策略，他们将在音乐会中由青主持的演讲中全面揭露帝国的异界本质。 TJ 与整个 Psi 排释放的谐波和 psi 场不会改变听众的思维，但会使他们深切感受到 Ching 演讲的情感分量与真诚，同时让每个人以母语聆听，并增强音乐带来的震撼。

To make sure everyone in the audience felt as pumped up as possible, Sergeant Bir had selected a program of rock music mostly from bands he'd confirmed with Asuka were also found on their Earth, ensuring the songs would be familiar to some of the audience. Shinji'd been less help, as his musical knowledge ran more to classical pieces, though even he had at least heard of Metallica, Queen, and Pink Floyd, if not Masterplan or Skillet. His knowledge of classical did help select the four pieces for his interlude. They were all cello-violin duets, as Ching had informed him they'd found a good violinist to accompany him. He was more than a little uncertain about performing in front of a huge crowd they had to make a good impression on without having any chance to rehearse with whoever it was. 'I really, really hope they're good, whoever they are. At least Canon in D is fairly simple and slow.' He planned to open with the Pachelbel piece, then Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre, with Mitsuda's Time's Scar and the Handel-Halvorsen Passacaglia if the violinist could handle it. If they couldn't, he'd stop, and beat as dignified a retreat as he could. 'Of course, that's assuming I don't screw up. I mustn't ru-' He clamped down on that all-too-familiar thought hard. He couldn't think like that anymore. 'What was the motto for 'my' ship? 'Here I Stand And Here I Remain'? That's a bit more like what I need right now.'

为了让观众们尽可能地热血沸腾，比尔中士精心挑选了一系列摇滚音乐，这些曲目大多来自他向明日香确认过的乐队，确保这些歌曲对部分观众来说耳熟能详。真嗣在这方面帮不上太多忙，他的音乐知识更偏向古典乐，尽管他也至少听说过金属乐队、皇后乐队和 Pink Floyd，但对于 Masterplan 或 Skillet 则不甚了解。不过，他对古典乐的了解有助于挑选出四首作为他间奏的曲目，这些都是大提琴与小提琴的二重奏，因为青告诉他找到了一位优秀的小提琴手来伴奏。他对于要在一大群必须留下好印象的观众面前表演感到颇为忐忑，而且还没有机会与那位不知是谁的搭档排练。“真的，真的希望他们很棒，无论他们是谁。至少 D 大调卡农相对简单且缓慢。”他计划以帕赫贝尔的作品开场，接着是圣桑的《骷髅之舞》，如果小提琴手能驾驭，再演奏光田康典的《时光之伤》以及亨德尔-哈尔沃森的《帕萨卡利亚》。如果不行，他就会停下来，尽可能体面地退场。 当然，这是假设我没有搞砸。我绝不能——'他用力遏制住那个太过熟悉的念头。他不能再那样想了。'我的'船的座右铭是什么来着？'我站在这里，我坚守于此'？这更像是我现在需要的。'

Very much right now; Ching was heading for the slit in the curtain with a wireless mic in hand, about to start the show. His part wasn't until the middle, but the music was about to begin.

此刻正是时候；青手握无线麦克风，正走向幕布的缝隙，准备开启演出。他的环节虽在中场，但音乐即将奏响。

The background rumble of the waiting crowd faded as a spotlight snapped on, throwing Ching's shadow onto the curtain. Shinji could watch her silhouette bow and wave to the quieting crowd.

等待的人群背景嘈杂声逐渐消退，一道聚光灯突然亮起，将青的影子投射到幕布上。新二能看见她的剪影向渐渐安静的观众鞠躬挥手。

"Greetings and good evening, people of Earth!" she began cheerily. There was a little laughter. "Oh, I bet you think I'm joking. But I'm really not from around here. Well, we'll get into just who we are and why we're here later in the show, but for now let me just welcome you all to our concert and say we are here to help you rebuild your world. And now, please give a warm hello to your first performers for tonight; Silken Crisis!"

"大家好，晚上好，地球上的人们！"她愉快地开场。现场响起一阵轻笑。"哦，我猜你们以为我在开玩笑。但其实我并非来自此地。稍后在节目中，我们会详细介绍我们是谁，以及为何来到这里，但现在，请允许我欢迎大家来到我们的音乐会，并告诉大家，我们此行是为了帮助你们重建家园。那么，现在请热烈欢迎今晚的首位表演者：Silken Crisis！"

Ching stepped back inside the curtains and trotted over to Shinji's side of the stage. The spotlight fell on TJ as the curtains opened. He was apparently staring at the floor in front of his microphone stand as the light hit him. The crowd waited, as close to silent as a body of people that large could be.

青回到幕布内，小跑到舞台上的真嗣一侧。随着幕布拉开，聚光灯落在 TJ 身上。他显然正盯着麦克风支架前的地面，灯光照在他身上。人群等待着，尽可能地保持静默，对于如此庞大的人群来说，这已是极限。

TJ suddenly raised his head and spoke gently into the mic. "Let there be rock."

TJ 突然抬起头，对着麦克风温柔地说：“让摇滚响起。”

Shinji rocked back as the band blasted to life. He had never learned to swim, and had only been to the shore once in his memory. But he had ventured out into the surf on that visit, seeking relief from the heat of post-Second Impact Japan's permanent summer. He'd felt the power of the ocean as the waves surged and swirled around his legs, pushing him back and forth with just a fraction of the power within them. He felt like that now, but this time it was sound doing the pushing, much, much stronger. Not just pushing at his body, but at his emotions. He felt his foot tapping and hand drumming along to the beat on his cello. His nervousness was fading, replaced by almost an eagerness to charge at things. The music rolled over him like a wave, and he let it sweep him away.

真嗣随着乐队的轰鸣声后仰。他从未学过游泳，记忆中只去过一次海边。但那次他冒险踏入海浪中，试图在第二次冲击后日本永夏的酷热中寻求一丝凉意。他感受到了海浪在他腿边汹涌翻腾的力量，仅凭其中一小部分就将他来回推动。此刻，他再次感受到这种力量，但这次是声音在推动，强大得多。不仅仅是推动他的身体，更是触动他的情感。他感到自己的脚在轻敲，手随着节奏在低音提琴上敲击。紧张感逐渐消退，取而代之的是几乎想要冲锋陷阵的渴望。音乐如波浪般席卷而来，他任由其将自己卷走。

'Awake and Alive' followed AC/DC's 'Let There Be Rock', then Metallica's 'Fuel'. He hadn't felt so ready to charge straight into something that scared him since Asuka goaded him into attacking the 12th Angel. 'Carpe Diem, Baby' sounded almost like an anthem for what he'd been trying to make himself think all day. Ignore pain, ignore fear, sieze your heart's desire and hold on tight… Wait, his heart's desire… where was she? He typed a quick text message into his interface band, the wall of sound from the band making a call impossible. After a moment, he did get a reply from Asuka, but all it said was 'I'll be there, baka. Relax.'

《觉醒与生存》紧随 AC/DC 的《让那里有摇滚》和 Metallica 的《燃料》之后。自明日香怂恿他攻击第 12 使徒以来，他从未如此准备好直面令他恐惧的事物。“把握今天，宝贝”几乎像是他一整天试图让自己坚信的颂歌。无视痛苦，无视恐惧，抓住内心的渴望并紧紧抓住……等等，他内心的渴望……她在哪里？他在界面带上迅速输入一条短信，乐队的巨大声浪使得通话变得不可能。片刻后，他收到了明日香的回复，但内容只有一句：“我会到的，笨蛋。放松点。”

'We are the lost ones… we could change the world… we could rewrite history', sang the next song. 'Yeah, that's our for sure are we lost. I don't think I've had a normal day since father summoned me, and I don't know if Askua has ever had one in her whole life.' Masterplan's 'The Spirit Never Dies' and 'Heroes' followed. Pink Floyd's 'Learning To Fly' gave him a soft landing from the surges of emotion the other songs had led him through. However, as soon as the song trailed off, his nerves began to return; that song marked the intermission. Once Ching gave her explanation of who they were and why there were there, she was going to introduce his performance.

下一首歌唱道：“我们是迷失者……我们能改变世界……我们能改写历史。”是啊，我们无疑迷失了。自从父亲召唤我以来，我不记得有过正常的一天，也不知道阿斯卡是否一生中曾有过。随后播放的是 Masterplan 的《精神永存》与《英雄》。Pink Floyd 的《学习飞翔》为他从其他歌曲激起的情感波涛中温柔着陆。然而，歌曲一结束，他的神经又开始紧绷；那首歌标志着中场休息。等青解释完他们是谁、为何在此之后，她将介绍他的表演。

Ching walked back out to center stage and waved to the roaring crowd. "Is everyone having a good time?" she asked. An enthusiastic roar answered her. "Well, good, because I'm about to blow your minds. I told you I'm not from around here. I'm your hostess for tonight, Junior Flight Lieutenant of the Blue Ching-Hao Liebshott. We're all from a long, long way away. How far? Take a look at our drummer. Stand up, Corporal."

青再次走回舞台中央，向欢呼的人群挥手致意。“大家玩得开心吗？”她问道。一阵热情的欢呼回应了她。“很好，因为我要让你们大开眼界。我告诉过你们，我不是本地人。今晚我是你们的主持人，蓝青浩中尉飞行少尉。我们来自很远很远的地方。有多远？看看我们的鼓手吧。站起来，下士。”

Corporal Vasraith stood up from behind the drum set as a spotlight snapped open on him. He waved to the crowd with all four arms moving separately. The enormous projection screens on either side of the stage presented him to the entire crowd. There were scattered gasps as his very non-Homo Sapiens appearance registered.

瓦斯莱思下士从鼓组后站起身，一束聚光灯瞬间打在他身上。他挥动着四只手臂，各自独立地向观众致意。舞台两侧巨大的投影屏幕将他的形象呈现给全场观众。随着他那非智人特征的外貌映入眼帘，观众中传来零星的惊叹声。

Ching waved at the Marine as she said to the crowd, "He's from my country too. Me? I'm just a Navy Pilot. The Imperial Navy of Avalon, that is, and yes, I like to fly. Watch!" Ching rolled and flexed her shoulders, and the crowd gasped in shock as a pair of huge dove grey wings with navy blue tips on the primary feathers erupted from her back. She flapped them gently a few times. "I don't know how many men I've had to tell this too, but yes, they're real. Want me to show you?" Enough cries from the audience answered affirmative for her to nod. "Ok, watch this!"

青向那位海军陆战队员挥了挥手，对人群说道：“他也是我的同胞。而我？我只是一个海军飞行员，来自阿瓦隆帝国的海军，没错，我喜欢飞行。看好了！”青扭动并耸了耸肩，人群中爆发出一阵惊呼，只见她背后展开了一对巨大的鸽灰色翅膀，主羽尖端点缀着海军蓝。她轻轻地拍动了几下翅膀。“我不知道已经向多少人解释过，但它们确实是真的。想让我展示一下吗？”人群中足够多的肯定回应让她点了点头。“好的，看这个！”

Ching took a couple of steps forward to the edge of the stage and leapt into the air. With a few heavy beats, her wings propelled her up and over the crowd, quickly gaining altitude. She skimmed around the stadium, staying low enough to be easy for people to see as she flew by, but high enough to make it very clear that she was indeed airborne. She did a couple of slow circuits of the stands, and swung back towards the stage, flaring to a graceful landing almost exactly where she'd started from. Folding her wings in close to her body, she spun back to the crowd with a winning smile. "What'd you think of that, everybody?"

青儿向前迈了几步，来到舞台边缘，纵身一跃。随着几下有力的振翅，她腾空而起，越过人群，迅速攀升。她在体育场上空低飞盘旋，保持足够的高度让人群清晰可见，同时又足以证明她确实在空中翱翔。她绕着看台缓缓飞了几圈，然后折返舞台，优雅地降落，几乎精准地回到了起跳点。她将翅膀紧贴身体，转身面向观众，露出了胜利的微笑：“大家觉得怎么样？”

The crowd's reaction was a little mixed, but mostly positive. A few voices cried out variations on 'she's an angel!', which made Ching shake her head. "No, I'm no angel. Just ask my mother. I'm no devil either, just ask my dad. I'm just a girl from a world not this one. We are all from a long way away, though, and we're here to help rebuild your world from the battering the last twenty years have given it. And we are here because of two heroes."

人群的反应有些复杂，但大体上是积极的。几个声音高喊着“她是天使！”的不同变体，这让青摇了摇头。“不，我不是天使。问问我母亲就知道了。我也不是恶魔，问问我父亲便知。我只是一个来自另一个世界的女孩。虽然我们都来自远方，但我们来这里是为了帮助重建你们的世界，过去二十年它遭受了太多打击。我们之所以来，是因为两位英雄。”

Shinji knew intellectually that there was no way the whole crowd was staring at him just yet, shielded as he was by the curtains, but it still felt like it as Ching began a brief summary of their 'heroic defense of the world' in the Angel War while clips of the battles played on the huge screens. He winced more than once as he watched Unit-01 be bashed about by the various Angels, and watched in horrified fascination at Asuka's incredible, unstoppable last stand against the Mass Production series. He'd seem impressions of it from her perspective in Instrumentality, but had never seen it like this. She made Unit-02 dance, tearing through her opponents like they were standing still…and he nearly wept as he watched her AT-Field and then her skull be pierced by a false Lance, and her batteries run dry.

真嗣理智上明白，此刻人群尚未能透过帷幕注视到他，但当青开始简述他们在天使战争中“保卫世界的英勇防御”，同时巨大屏幕上播放着战斗片段时，他仍感觉仿佛所有人都在盯着他。看着零号机被各种天使击打，他不止一次地皱眉，而当目睹明日香在对抗量产机型时那令人震撼、无法阻挡的最后抵抗，他更是惊骇万分。在人类补完计划中，他曾从她的视角感受过这一幕，却从未如此直观地见证。她让二号机如同舞蹈般穿梭，撕裂对手如同静止不动……而当看到她的 AT 力场和头骨被伪朗基努斯之枪贯穿，以及能量耗尽的那一刻，他几乎泪流满面。

Mercifully, the clip did not show what happened next. Ching instead talked about his father's triggering the Third Impact himself, "with the bodies of the First and Second Angels. But the Second Angel's soul refused Commander Ikari, and gave the power to decide humanity's fate to his son, Pilot Shinji Ikari, for only he had shown her kindness and asked nothing in return. It was he who decided to undo what his father had done, and allow humanity to return to life and keep trying for happiness." Huge pictures of Asuka and himself filled the screen now, current ones, showing them in their Imperial Army uniforms. Shinji was a little surprised to note he actually looked…kind of happy in the picture. Happier than any of his old school ID pictures had shown, at least. Asuka did for sure. Her smile calmed him right until he remembered that he was about to go on stage and still had no idea where she was.

幸运的是，视频并未展示接下来的情景。Ching 转而谈及他的父亲如何利用第一和第二使徒的躯体，自行引发了第三次冲击。“但第二使徒的灵魂拒绝了伊吹指挥官，并将决定人类命运的力量赋予了他的儿子，驾驶员碇真嗣，因为只有他曾向她展现过善意，且不求任何回报。正是他决定撤销父亲所为，让人类重返世间，继续追寻幸福。”此时屏幕上出现了 Asuka 和自己的巨幅近照，两人身着帝国军装。真嗣略感惊讶地发现，照片中的自己竟显得……颇为快乐。至少比以往任何一张学生证照片都要快乐。Asuka 确实如此。她的笑容让他心安，直到他记起自己即将登台，却仍不知她的下落。

"Those two heroes, Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu, were also instrumental in toppling the brutal dictator General Winthrop, who had taken over the UN and its stockpile of N2 mines in Europe. After their work overthrowing Winthrop's regime, they made contact with our Empire, and arranged for a little help in rebuilding your world. A little help like oh… those."

那两位英雄，碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷，在推翻残暴的独裁者温斯洛普将军的过程中也发挥了关键作用。这位将军曾控制了联合国及其在欧洲的 N2 地雷储备。在成功颠覆温斯洛普政权后，他们与我们帝国取得联系，并安排了些许援助，以助你们的世界重建。就像……那些援助一样。

Ching pointed into the sky on the far side of the stadium. Spotlights snapped to life and swiveled to point skyward, suddenly illuminating the smoothly approaching bulks of two Black Knight mecha.

青指向体育场远端的天空。聚光灯瞬间亮起并旋转指向天际，突然照亮了两台黑色骑士机甲平稳接近的庞大身躯。

"Say hello to Lieutenants Suzuhara and Aida, two friends of our heroes, and newly trained Imperial Army pilots! These mighty mecha will be helping put down the warlords and petty tyrants who have terrorized the land for the last four years. And those aren't even our biggest ones!" Amazed shouts and a few cheers rippled through the crowd. Touji and Kensuke's mecha made a slow circuit of their own around the upper reaches of the stadium, befor heading off to the north where cleared space in some of the sports complex's fields had been kept open for them.

向我们的英雄的两位朋友，新晋帝国陆军飞行员铃原中尉和相田中尉问好吧！这两位勇士将驾驶强大的机甲，协助平定过去四年来一直肆虐这片土地的军阀和小暴君。而且，这些还不是我们最大的机甲呢！"惊叹声和几声欢呼在人群中荡漾开来。东治和健介的机甲缓缓绕着体育场上空巡游一周，随后向北飞去，那里体育综合体的几个运动场已为他们预留了开阔的降落空间。

"Mister Ikari and Miss Sohryu have also accepted commissions as Imperial Army officers, and are in command of this unit. They are here now with us tonight, and as a means of introduction Lieutenant Ikari has consented to play us a few pieces, as he is also an accomplished cellist. Come on out and take a bow, Lieutenant Ikari!" Ching beckoned him over. He picked up his cello and bow and swallowed heavily as he stepped out onto the stage. The rising applause as he drew next to Ching just mystified him. 'People are cheering for me just standing here? What do they expect from me, miracles? It's my fault the world is this messed up in the first place.' He bowed stiffly and concentrated on trying not to look like he was about to throw up.

碇先生与惣流小姐也接受了帝国军官的委任，并指挥着这支部队。今晚他们与我们同在，作为介绍，碇中尉同意为我们演奏几曲，他同时也是一位技艺精湛的大提琴手。请出来并鞠个躬吧，碇中尉！”青木向他招手。他拿起大提琴和弓，沉重地咽了口唾沫，走上舞台。当他靠近青木时，掌声渐起，这让他感到困惑。人们只是因为我站在这里就欢呼吗？他们期待我做什么，奇迹吗？毕竟，世界变得如此混乱，我也有责任。”他僵硬地鞠了一躬，集中精力不让自己看起来像是要呕吐。

"And accompanying him on violin, our unit commander, Lieutenant Asuka Langley Sohryu!"

与他一同演奏小提琴的，是我们部队的指挥官，飞鸟·兰格雷·明日香中尉！

Shinji felt a shock run through his entire body. His head snapped to the right and his eyes went wide.  
真嗣感到一股震撼贯穿全身。他的头猛地转向右侧，眼睛瞪得大大的。

Asuka was confidently striding out from stage right with a violin and bow in hand, her long red hair trailing behind her like a torch's flame. A flowing red silk dress cut like a tango dancer's clung to her figure like water. She stopped on Ching's other side and gracefully curtseyed to the audience. She smirked at Shinji's obvious shock as she rose. "I _told_ you I'd be here, Baka-Shinji," she said amusedly.  
明日香自信地从舞台右侧大步走出，手中拿着小提琴和弓，她那长长的红发如火炬般飘扬在身后。一件如探戈舞者般剪裁的红色丝绸连衣裙紧贴着她的身形，宛如水流。她在清的另一侧停下，优雅地向观众行了个屈膝礼。她起身时，对真嗣明显的震惊露出了得意的微笑。“我告诉过你会在这里的，笨蛋真嗣，”她带着几分戏谑地说。

"Take your places, you two. You're on as soon as I walk off," Ching said quietly to them. To the audience, she proclaimed, "After our two heroes play a few pieces for you, Silken Crisis will be back for the second half of their show, and we've got a _big_ surprise for you at the end, so stick around!" She waived gaily to the audience and headed off stage to the left. Her wings shrank into her back as she walked, drawing further astonished noises from the crowd.  
“你们两个，准备好位置。我一走你们就开始，”清轻声对他们说。面向观众，她宣布道：“我们的两位英雄将为你们演奏几曲之后，Silken Crisis 将重返舞台进行下半场表演，我们还有个大惊喜在最后，敬请期待！”她愉快地向观众挥手，然后向舞台左侧走去。随着她的步伐，翅膀缩回背部，引来观众更多的惊叹声。

Her departure left Shinji and Asuka with only moments to set themselves in position. Shinji sat in the chair left for him mid-stage, while Asuka placed herself right behind the music stand that had been placed next to it.  
她的离去让真嗣和明日香只剩下片刻时间来调整自己的位置。真嗣坐在舞台中央为他预留的椅子上，而明日香则站在放置在他旁边的乐谱架后面。

"Why didn't you ever tell me you could play the violin?! And why did you disappear all afternoon? We could have been rehearsing!" Shinji finally managed to whisper urgently.  
“你为什么不告诉我你会拉小提琴？！还有，你整个下午都去哪儿了？我们本可以排练的！”真嗣终于急切地低声问道。

She just smirked again. "You never asked, Baka-Shinji. And I haven't played for years, so I needed to practice by myself to see if I could well enough for this performance. If I wasn't up to standard, you'd have a different partner playing this. But you're my partner from now on, so I made sure I was. Though I can't do this whole thing from memory like you, so I need this stand," Asuka tapped her bow against the small screen on the stand in front of her. "As a backup. Now, we're in front of fifty thousand people who expect magic from us, and Ching's already puffed us up as conquering heroes. You better not drop a note and make me look bad, Third, or you're dead meat." She gave him a sharp look.  
她只是再次轻蔑地笑了笑。“你从来没问过，笨蛋真嗣。我已经好几年没拉了，所以我需要独自练习，看看是否能胜任这次演出。如果我达不到标准，你会和另一个搭档演奏。但从现在开始，你是我的搭档，所以我确保我能做到。虽然我不能像你那样完全凭记忆演奏，所以我需要这个架子，”明日香用她的弓轻敲了敲面前的架子上的小屏幕。“作为备份。现在，我们面前有五万观众期待着我们的魔法，而且 Ching 已经把我们吹捧成了征服英雄。你最好别拉错一个音符让我丢脸，第三，否则你就死定了。”她给了他一个锐利的眼神。

Her attempt at a glare would have easily cowed the Shinji of Tokyo-3. Now, though, he could hear the note of tension in her voice, see the flicker of hesitation in her eyes, and knew deep in his own mind that she was far more worried about her own skill in this performance. Even she'd complimented him in front of the whole unit that morning, proclaiming his skill with the cello among the few things he really was skilled at. She loved the spotlight, and she'd always tried her utmost to compete with him at everything. She wouldn't avoid the challenge. But if it had been years since she'd played… He knew for sure, Asuka would hate like nothing else to mess up in front of a crowd like this. And he could even hear the possessive note when she claimed him as her exclusive partner. _'__Yeah… I'm hers. And that's what I want to be. I won't let her down.'_ The thought steadied him and put a small but determined smile on his face. He knew how to steady her; push back. Challenge her, get her mind focused on competing with him rather than the audience. He felt his seldom-woken pride raising its head. "I'm ready whenever you are. Try to keep up with me, Second Child," he taunted and set his bow against the strings of his cello.  
她那试图凌厉的瞪视，放在东京-3 时或许轻易就能让真嗣屈服。然而现在，他能听出她声音中的紧张，看到她眼中闪过的犹豫，深知她对自己在这场表演中的技艺有多么担忧。就连那天早上，她还在全队面前夸赞他，宣称他在大提琴上的造诣是他少数真正擅长的几件事之一。她热爱聚光灯，总是竭尽全力在各方面与他竞争。她不会逃避挑战。但如果她已经多年未曾演奏……他确信，在这种场合出错，对明日香来说绝对是无法忍受的。甚至当她宣称他是她的专属搭档时，他都能听出那股占有欲。“是啊……我是她的。这就是我想要的。我不会让她失望。”这个念头让他镇定下来，脸上浮现出一抹虽小却坚定的微笑。他知道如何让她稳定；反击回去。挑战她，让她将注意力集中在与他竞争而非观众上。他感到自己那鲜少觉醒的骄傲正抬头。“我随时都准备好了。” “试着跟上我，二号机驾驶员。”他嘲弄道，将弓搭在提琴弦上。

Asuka's eyes widened a hair and her nostrils flared. Shinji just smiled wider. After a moment, so did she. She placed her own bow in position and smiled wickedly back at him. "So, you want to play today, do you, Third? Alright then… one, two, one, two, three…"  
明日香的眼眸微微睁大，鼻翼翕动。真嗣的笑容更加灿烂。片刻后，她也笑了。她将自己的弓摆好位置，狡黠地回望他。“那么，今天你想玩玩，是吗，三号？好吧……一，二，一，二，三……”

He began the slow, deep base line for _Canon in D_, and Asuka began her part with barely the slightest hesitation. He once again was glad for all the practice that had freed him from the need to keep his eyes on sheet music, as it left him free to watch her. And oh, what a treasure that was. She kept flicking a look at him every few seconds, but her attention was mostly on the music slowly scrolling on the screen in front of her. She was focused like a hawk, the intense, ferocious effort she gave everything she felt was a challenge to her self-image as the best at everything. She matched him perfectly, note for note, swaying slightly at the beat. Shinji had to get a hold of himself pretty quickly. He almost flubbed a note when he found himself spending more attention on watching her than playing. He took a deep breath and bore down. He still couldn't keep his eyes off her, but after just a few more beats he was almost unconsciously swaying with her, breathing with her…  
他开始缓缓地弹奏 D 大调卡农的低音部分，明日香几乎毫不犹豫地开始了她的部分。他再次庆幸自己通过大量练习摆脱了对乐谱的依赖，这样他就能自由地注视她。哦，那真是一份珍贵的宝藏。她每隔几秒就瞥他一眼，但大部分注意力都集中在面前屏幕上缓缓滚动的乐谱上。她专注得像一只鹰，那种对任何挑战都全力以赴、凶猛努力的劲头，正是她自视为无所不能的自我形象的体现。她与他完美契合，音符对音符，随着节奏轻轻摇摆。真嗣不得不迅速稳住自己。当他发现自己过多地关注她而差点弹错一个音符时，他深吸一口气，集中精神。他仍然无法将目光从她身上移开，但仅仅几拍之后，他几乎不自觉地与她一同摇摆，与她一同呼吸……

And just like that, with an almost tactile snap, they were back in synch. He could feel her motions, tell exactly how and when she was going to hit each note. They moved with one will, the music easily flowing from both of them. He could tell she felt it too; her glances at the music became less and less frequent, and her stares at him longer and longer. By the halfway mark, they were looking only at each other. The rest of the world fell away as they played at each other, with each other, for each other… The last measure trailed off to silence. The outbreak of thunderous applause from the audience came as a surprise to both of them as the world rushed back in. Asuka kept her eyes locked with his for a moment before turning to the audience and giving a graceful bow and a smile. She came back upright and pivoted back to him, her eyes dancing.  
就这样，随着一种近乎触手可及的清脆声响，他们重新同步了。他能感受到她的动作，准确地判断出她何时以及如何击中每一个音符。他们以一种意志行动，音乐轻松地从两人身上流淌出来。他知道她也有同样的感觉；她看乐谱的次数越来越少，而凝视他的时间越来越长。到了一半的时候，他们只注视着对方。世界其他部分都消失了，他们彼此演奏，与彼此合作，为彼此而奏……最后一小节渐渐消失在寂静中。观众爆发出雷鸣般的掌声，这对他们俩来说都是一个惊喜，世界再次涌入。明日香保持目光锁定在他身上片刻，然后转向观众，优雅地鞠躬并微笑。她再次直起身，转身回到他面前，眼中闪烁着光芒。

"Ready for _Danse Macabre_, Baka-Shinji?" she asked, her voice vibrating with the energy she always threw off like a dynamo when she met a challenge successfully.  
“准备好跳《死亡之舞》了吗，笨蛋真嗣？”她问道，声音中充满了她每次成功面对挑战时总是散发出的那种活力，就像发电机一样。

Shinji grinned back at her. "Bring it on, Second Child."  
真嗣对她咧嘴一笑。“来吧，二号机驾驶员。”

The synch came almost on the first note this time. Asuka barely glanced at her music stand. To Shinji's increasing joy, she began moving more and more, slowly beginning to dance as she played. She orbited around him as the music played, dragging Shinji's gaze with her. Asuka must have taken ballet at some point, possibly as part of her Pilot training that took up her whole childhood, for she moved with the same precise, smooth movements of that art. All the while her playing never faltered. Shinji kept his eyes locked on her, but knew that even if they'd been closed, he still could have caught every last nuance and motion of her playing and matched her perfectly. She came back around to her place by the music stand just as the last note was played, her crystal blue eyes sparkling at his. The look on her face was electric.  
这次同步几乎在第一个音符响起时就出现了。明日香几乎没有看她的乐谱架。令真嗣越发欣喜的是，她开始越来越多地移动，慢慢地随着演奏起舞。她在音乐声中绕着他旋转，牵引着他的目光。明日香一定在某时学过芭蕾，可能是作为占用她整个童年的驾驶员训练的一部分，因为她移动时带着那种艺术的精确与流畅。与此同时，她的演奏从未出错。真嗣紧盯着她，但知道即使闭上眼睛，他仍能捕捉到她演奏的每一个细节和动作，并与她完美契合。她在最后一个音符奏响时刚好回到乐谱架旁的位置，她那清澈的蓝眼睛闪烁着光芒。她脸上的表情充满了活力。

Once again, the avalanche of applause from the audience broke in on their private world. This time they turned and sketched short bows to the audience in perfect unison. They each raised their bows without a single word needing to be spoken aloud and prepared for the next piece, Mitsuda's _Time's Scar_. The tin whistle, drums, and other backing instruments would be provided by computer support that Sergeant De Silva had assured him would be as good as having a full orchestra around him, but the piece had still been adapted to let the violin and cello take more of the music than they would have originally.  
又一次，观众席上爆发的掌声如雪崩般闯入他们的私人世界。这次，他们默契地转身，向观众简短地鞠躬致意。无需任何言语，两人各自举起弓，准备演奏下一曲——Mitsuda 的《时间的伤痕》。锡笛、鼓及其他伴奏乐器将由 De Silva 中士保证如同一支完整管弦乐队般出色的电脑支持来提供，但乐曲仍经过改编，让小提琴和大提琴承担了比原版更多的音乐比重。

Asuka began to move almost as soon as the music began. Her steps were slow and circling at first, keeping time to the melody. She began to speed up with the tune, smoothly beginning to play her part as the measure came and increasing the tempo of her dance to match. _'__Keep up the music, idiot! If you miss a single beat because you're staring at her move, she'll beat your fool head in with your own cello!'_ Shinji castigated himself. He was playing with all the spirit he could muster, trying to match the boundless energy Asuka seemed to be soaking in from the crowd's applause between pieces. _'__But it's hard!'_ he protested right back at himself. '_Look at her! She's… she's… watching her move and play like that… it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!'_  
音乐刚起，明日香便几乎同时开始舞动。起初她的步伐缓慢而环绕，与旋律同步。随着曲调加快，她流畅地开始扮演起自己的角色，随着节拍的来临逐渐提升舞蹈的节奏。“跟上音乐，笨蛋！如果你因为盯着她看而漏掉一个节拍，她会用你的大提琴把你那蠢脑袋砸个稀巴烂！”真嗣在心里斥责自己。他竭尽全力地演奏，试图与明日香似乎从观众掌声中汲取的无穷能量相匹配。“但真的很难！”他在心里反驳自己。“看看她！她……她……那样舞动和演奏……是我见过的最美的一幕！”

The music swirled to its climax and cooled to a gentler end. Asuka timed her dance perfectly to leave her facing him again just as the last note trailed away. The crowd erupted with applause again. They never broke eye contact. He could hear her challenge without a word, just reading her look. He felt a smile growing on his face to match the one on hers. Again their bows rose to the ready. They held their positions in silence for a moment, almost daring the other to move first. _'__One… two… three… now!'_ flashed through Shinji's mind. Their bows began to move at exactly the same instant.  
音乐旋即达到高潮，又缓缓降至柔和的尾声。明日香恰到好处地调整舞步，在最后一个音符消散之际，再次正对他而立。人群再次爆发出掌声。他们始终未曾移开视线。无需言语，他便能感受到她的挑战，仅凭眼神读懂一切。他的脸上渐渐绽放出与她相映的笑容。两人再次将弓举至预备位置。他们静止片刻，几乎是在挑衅对方先行动作。'一…二…三…现在！' 闪过真嗣的脑海。他们的弓几乎同时开始移动。

The Handel-Halvorsen _Passacaglia_ had long been a favorite of Shinji's, a piece that really let a cello almost fight with a violin, as much a duel as a duet. But he had never had a partner to play it with, always having to be content with merely playing the cello parts solo with a recording of the violin side as his accompaniment. But now…now he truly had a partner. And the performance was like something out of his wildest dreams. _'__I've never felt this good before,'_ he thought, his hands working feverishly to keep up with Asuka and the intricate melody. _'__I don't want this to ever end. I want to do this all the time.'_ Her eyes never wavered a millimeter from his, her gaze unbreakably magnetic. Not that he had the slightest impulse to look away. Her eyes flashing at him over her violin, his cello purring and humming right back at her… _'__I want to do this for years and years. I want her with me every day and every night for as long as we both shall live. I want her to…'_ It took an act of will and a spike to his heart rate to keep his hands from fumbling the bow as the thought shot across his mind. _'__I want her to be mine the way I'm hers. I want her to be my… my…. I want to ask her to be…'_  
亨德尔-哈尔沃森的《帕萨卡利亚》一直是真嗣的最爱，这首曲子让大提琴几乎与小提琴展开较量，既是二重奏也是对决。但他从未有过搭档与之合奏，只能满足于独自演奏大提琴部分，并伴以小提琴录音。然而现在……他真的有了一个搭档。这场演奏宛如他最狂野的梦境成真。“我从未感觉如此美好，”他心想，双手急切地跟上明日香和那复杂的旋律。“我不想这一切结束。我想一直这样。”她的目光从未从他身上移开分毫，眼神坚定而迷人。他也没有丝毫想要移开视线的冲动。她的小提琴在眼前闪烁，他的大提琴则低沉回应……“我想年复一年地这样做。我希望她日日夜夜与我同在，只要我们活着。我希望她……”这个念头如闪电般划过脑海，让他心跳加速，费了好大劲才没让手中的弓滑落。“我希望她像我属于她一样属于我。我希望她是我的……我的……”我想请她成为…

Both of them worked their bows with every ounce of energy they could, playing at each other, challenging the other to match them. Even the softer, quieter bits became places to feel the push back and forth through their synch. Asuka swayed and danced around his chair in the slower moments. He could feel her all the way around him without having to look. Shinji grinned wider and played harder, Asuka matching him note for note. Shinji could feel the fire between them building, building… The music vibrated between them, working its way to the furious climax. They finished the final notes with a flourish of their bows in perfect unison. Shinji distantly noted that Asuka was flushed and breathing as hard as he was.  
两人竭尽全力地拉动弓弦，彼此竞技，挑战对方与之匹敌。即便是柔和、安静的部分，也成了他们感受彼此推拉同步的场所。在较慢的段落中，明日香围绕着他的椅子摇摆起舞。他无需看就能感受到她环绕在他周围。真嗣笑得更开，演奏得更卖力，明日香也音符对音符地回应着他。真嗣能感觉到他们之间的激情在不断升温，升温……音乐在他们之间振动，逐渐达到狂热的顶峰。他们以弓的华丽挥舞，完美同步地结束了最后的音符。真嗣隐约注意到明日香的脸颊泛红，呼吸和他一样急促。

The crowd exploded with applause and cheers again, but he didn't hear a thing. All he saw was Asuka quickly laying her bow against the neck of her violin to free her right hand, closing the gap between them, and pulling him up to stand so she could plant a wild and urgent kiss on his lips. He dropped his bow and pulled her hard against him. The crowd cheered louder.  
人群再次爆发出掌声和欢呼声，但他什么也没听见。他眼中只有明日香迅速将弓放在小提琴颈上，腾出右手，缩短了他们之间的距离，拉他起身，然后急切而狂野地吻上了他的唇。他松开弓，将她紧紧拥入怀中。人群的欢呼声更加响亮。

Asuka finally pulled back from the kiss just enough to free her mouth. She stared right into his eyes, their foreheads still pressed together. "Grab your cello and follow me close, Third Child. We are exiting, stage left, before I have you right here and now on stage." Her grin would have done credit to a Great White shark. They made a single deep bow to the audience and he had just enough time to pick up his bow before Asuka grabbed his wrist and began leading him off stage at a fast walk.  
绫波终于从那个吻中稍稍退开，足以让她的嘴自由。她直视着他的眼睛，两人的额头依旧紧贴。“带上你的大提琴，紧跟着我，第三适格者。我们要在舞台左侧退场，不然我可要在台上把你当场办了。”她的笑容简直能媲美大白鲨。他们向观众深深鞠了一躬，他刚来得及拿起弓，绫波就抓住他的手腕，快步带他离开舞台。

They zoomed past a visibly amused Ching coming back on stage to introduce the second half of the show. "Don't break him, Lieutenant Sohryu! You both have to come back for the finale!" she called at their backs. The crowd roared with laughter.

Immediately off-stage they zipped past an admirably blank-faced Sergeant Bir, who stared determinedly at the air above their heads and muttered, "Figured something like this might happen, ma'am. Second door on the left in the first hallway over there." He gestured towards the closest of the hallways entering under the stands. Asuka didn't even slow down, but angled for it. The door in question had a neat sign on it reading 'Commander's Use Only', and proved to have a made bed inside, with a small screen on one wall that was already showing Ching on stage and Silken Crisis resuming their places behind her.  
"一离开舞台，他们就飞快地从面无表情的比尔军士身边掠过，后者坚定地盯着他们头顶上的空气，低声说道：“我就知道可能会发生这种事，女士。左边第二个门，就在那边的第一个走廊里。”他指向看台下最近的那个走廊。明日香丝毫没有减速，径直朝那里走去。那扇门上挂着一个整洁的牌子，写着“指挥官专用”，里面有一张铺好的床，墙上有一块小屏幕，正显示着青在台上，而丝滑危机在她身后重新就位。”

Asuka rapidly put her violin down on the small table beside the door, which she quickly shut and locked. Shinji had just long enough to put his cello beside it and turn around before Asuka slammed back into him and resumed kissing him fiercely. Her hands wormed their way up to his collar and began working it open.  
"明日香迅速将小提琴放在门旁的小桌上，迅速关上门并锁好。真嗣刚来得及把大提琴放在旁边并转过身来，明日香就猛地扑回他怀里，继续热烈地亲吻他。她的手摸索着爬上他的衣领，开始解开它。”

"I… love… you… Asuka," he managed between kisses.  
"“我……爱……你……明日香，”他在亲吻间勉强说道。”

"Get… your… clothes… off… Shinji," she answered. She pulled back from their embrace and began pulling her dress up over her head, tossing it aside. "I want to hear you moaning my name again." Her underwear followed the dress.  
“把…你的…衣服…脱掉…真嗣，”她回答道。她从他们的拥抱中抽身后退，开始将裙子从头顶拉起，扔到一旁。“我想再听到你呻吟我的名字。”她的内衣也跟着裙子一起被丢开。

Shinji began removing his uniform just as quickly, still smiling. "That was…really fun, Asuka. I've never had a partner to play the _Passacaglia_ with before. I… want to do that again… with you."  
真嗣同样迅速地脱下制服，脸上依旧挂着微笑。“那真是…非常有趣，明日香。我以前从未有过能一起演奏《帕萨卡利亚》的搭档。我…想再和你一起做这件事。”

"Later, Shinji. Right now you and I have a date with that bed. I feel like I'm about to explode already," Asuka said, pointing behind him. She squealed in surprise when the Third Child suddenly lifted her up to cradle her in his arms and walked over to the bed.  
“待会儿再说，真嗣。现在你和我得去那张床上约会了。我感觉自己快要爆炸了，”明日香指着他的身后说道。当第三适格者突然将她抱起，让她依偎在他怀里走向床边时，她惊叫出声。

"And I am not about to argue with you on that. But you just made me incredibly happy out there and I want to do that with you over and over again. I've never done anything like that with anyone. It was like a dream come true." He gently laid Asuka down on the bed. "So now I want to show you how good that made me feel." _'And I've wanted to try this with you for years.'_  
“我可不想和你争论这个。但你刚才让我无比开心，我想和你一次又一次地重温那种感觉。我从没和任何人做过那样的事。那就像梦想成真。”他温柔地将明日香放在床上。“所以现在我想让你知道那让我感觉有多好。”“而且我多年来一直想和你尝试这个。”

Asuka looked at him a little quizzically, but still smiled as he lowered himself onto the bed at her feet. She shivered happily as his warm hands slid up her legs. "Shinji, what are talking abooooOOOOOOOHH!"  
明日香略带疑惑地看着他，但仍微笑着，当他俯身躺在她脚边时。他的温暖双手滑过她的双腿，她快乐地颤抖着。“真嗣，你在说什么啊啊啊啊啊啊！”

On the screen on the far wall of the room, Ching smiled to the crowd. "Yes, we are taking bets on them. See the booth in the building just east of the main gate for details and odds. Our two amazing Pilots will be back at the end of the show, folks, and wait until you see what _they_ drive! And now, here's Silken Crisis to hit you with some more rock and roll!" She walked off to stage left as TJ led the band into one of Queen's greatest hits.  
在房间远处的墙上，屏幕中的青笑着对观众说：“是的，我们正在为他们下注。详情和赔率请到主门东侧的展位查看。我们的两位出色驾驶员将在节目结束时回来，伙计们，等着看他们开什么车吧！现在，让 Silken Crisis 乐队为大家带来更多摇滚乐！”她走向舞台左侧，TJ 带领乐队演奏起皇后乐队的一首经典曲目。

_'__Heeeeeeeere_ _we are, born to be kings, we're the Princes of the Universe….'_  
'我们来了，生而为王，我们是宇宙的王子……'

Neither _'On The Turning Away'_ or _'The Ecstacy of Gold'_ really made an impression on Shinji's mind. _'Do You Hear The People Sing?'_ didn't even register. He was busy. Asuka's ecstatic howls drowned out the music most of the time anyhow. He lost track of time, and Asuka certainly didn't seem to be worrying about it at all. Several more songs flowed by before Asuka's interface band flashed insistently. Asuka cracked her eyes open slowly and glared at it before reluctantly hitting the blinking 'accept' button. "Wha'd ya wan', Chin'?" Shinji heard her slur lazily.  
无论是‘转身离去’还是‘黄金狂喜’，都没有在真嗣心中留下深刻印象。‘你可听见人民在歌唱？’甚至没有引起他的注意。他正忙着。明日香狂喜的嚎叫大部分时间都盖过了音乐。他忘记了时间，而明日香显然一点也不担心。几首歌过去了，明日香的接口带才坚持闪烁。明日香慢慢睁开眼睛，瞪了它一眼，然后不情愿地按下了闪烁的‘接受’按钮。“你想要啥，中国佬？”真嗣听到她懒洋洋地含糊说道。

"I'm really sorry to have to do this, as I can make a pretty good guess what I'm interrupting, but you two are due overhead in 15 minutes," their friend's voice said.  
"我很抱歉不得不这么做，因为我大致能猜到我打断的是什么，但你们俩还有 15 分钟就要上场了，"他们朋友的声音说道。

"I cann' feel muh legzz," Asuka replied, her voice dreamy and pleased.  
"我感觉不到我的腿了，"明日香回答，她的声音梦幻而愉悦。

"Then you'd better get Shinji to carry you to the mecha, because this is supposed to be the part where you two wow the crowd with your new toy. I can stall things for a few minutes with some more explanation of what we're all about, but you're supposed to be the showstopper. Up and at 'em, sister." The call terminated with a small beep.  
"那你最好让真嗣把你抱到机甲那儿去，因为这应该是你们俩用新玩具惊艳全场的部分。我可以再用一些解释来拖延几分钟，但你们应该是压轴的。快点振作起来，姐妹。"通话在小声的哔哔声中结束。

Asuka groaned unhappily and rolled her head around on the pillow. "Nnnnn… Shinji, we've got to get going."  
明日香不满地哼了一声，在枕头上转了转头。“嗯……真嗣，我们得出发了。”

Shinji raised his head. "Aw, but I was having fun." He smiled shyly.  
真嗣抬起头来。“哎，但我正玩得开心呢。”他腼腆地笑了笑。

Asuka raised her head and looked down at him. "_You're_ having fun? Gott… now I _really_ wish we'd started doing this back in Misato's apartment." She rolled onto her side and stood up. She wobbled slightly before getting her legs under her. "Whoa… alright. Let's get going before I forget why and jump back in bed with you." She somewhat unsteadily walked to where she'd flung her clothes. She looked back over her shoulder as she stooped to pick them up. "And you will be doing more of that tonight, Third Child!" she said with a grin. "You owe me five years of backlog of that. Now quit ogling my perfect behind and get your clothes on too. We've got a grand entrance to make."  
明日香也抬起头，低头看着他。“你玩得开心？天哪……我现在真希望我们早就在美里小姐的公寓里开始这么做了。”她侧身滚下床，站了起来。她稍微摇晃了一下才稳住双腿。“哇……好吧。我们赶紧走吧，免得我忘了为什么又跳回床上和你腻在一起。”她有些不稳地走向扔衣服的地方。弯腰捡起衣服时，她回头瞥了一眼。“而且今晚你还得继续，第三适格者！”她笑着说，“你欠我五年的积压呢。现在别再盯着我的完美背影了，也赶紧穿衣服。我们得风光出场呢。”

With effort, Shinji pulled his eyes away from their target and got up as well to collect his uniform. "A grand entrance in a giant red mecha in front of a riveted crowd, huh? At least this time there's no giant fish Angel trying to eat us, and I don't have to wear one of your plugsuits. That thing pinched in tender places."  
经过一番努力，真嗣将目光从目标上移开，也站起身来收拾自己的制服。“在一大群目瞪口呆的观众面前，驾驶着巨大的红色机甲华丽登场，是吧？至少这次没有巨大的鱼形使徒试图吃掉我们，我也不必再穿你的插入栓服。那玩意儿在敏感部位勒得可真紧。”

Asuka snickered at him. "But you looked so _cute_ in it! It showed off your backside. And now I know _why_ it pinched you so much up front!" She laughed some more and smacked him on said backside as he bent over to pull up his pants. "Come on, Third, let's get a move on. We've got an adoring audience to impress some more."  
明日香对他嗤之以鼻。“但你穿起来真的很可爱！展示了你的臀部线条。现在我知道为什么前面勒得你那么紧了！”她又笑了起来，在他弯腰提裤子时拍了拍他的臀部。“快点，三号，我们得抓紧时间。还有一群崇拜者等着我们继续惊艳呢。”

It was simple to set the external mics to let them hear the music pouring out of the stadium as _Roter Wirbelsturm_ silently drifted closer to the Monumental Stadium. Silken Crisis had just finished Yellow Dancer's _'Look Up! The Sky Is Falling'_, which left just one song before they were due to appear for the big finale.  
将外部麦克风调至让他们能听到从体育场传出的音乐，红色旋风号悄无声息地向纪念体育场靠近。Silken Crisis 刚刚结束了 Yellow Dancer 的《抬头看！天空在坠落》，这意味着他们只需再唱一首歌，就该登场进行盛大的压轴表演了。

Asuka was vaguely grateful for the piloting frame helping support her. Her legs were still a little shaky. Hell, her whole body was still vibrating happily. _'Mmm… Waking up this morning, thousands of people cheering us, playing that duet with MY baka, what he just did, what we're about to do, and what he's promised to do tonight still to come? This is looking like the best day ever.'_ She grinned to herself. _'And oh yes yes yessy yes, he's mine mine mine. I'm not letting him go, not on your say-so, Wonderbitch, not on anyone else's, not for anything. He's mine until we're both worms' meat. Mine mine mine mine…'_  
明日香隐约感激驾驶舱框架支撑着她。她的双腿还有些发软。该死，她的整个身体仍在快乐地颤抖。'嗯……今早醒来，成千上万的人为我们欢呼，与我的笨蛋合奏，他刚刚做的事，我们即将做的事，以及他今晚承诺要做的事？这看起来像是有史以来最好的一天。'她暗自笑了。'哦，是的，是的，是的，他是我的，我的，我的。我不会让他离开，不是你说了算，奇迹婊子，不是任何人的，不是为了任何事。他属于我，直到我们都变成虫子的食物。我的，我的，我的，我的……'

The strains of the last song began below. Asuka pushed at the controls, beginning their movement. Asuka could see the spotlights reaching skyward, finally fixing on _Roter Wirbelsturm_'s bulk as they drew closer. TJ's voice thundered up clearly from the massive speakers. "So give me your hands/ Give me your hearts/ I'm ready!/ There's only one direction/ One world…one nation/ Yeah one vision…"  
最后一首歌的旋律开始响起。明日香推动控制杆，启动了他们的移动。明日香可以看到聚光灯向天空延伸，最终锁定在他们逐渐接近的红色旋风号上。TJ 的声音从巨大的扬声器中清晰地传来。"所以伸出你的手/给我你的心/我准备好了!/只有一个方向/一个世界…一个国家/是的，一个愿景…"

They floated over the edge of the stadium just as the song hit its climax. Shinji's puzzled voice broke in on her contented musing. "Asuka, I know your English is still much better than mine, so tell me that song didn't just end with 'Fried Chicken!'."  
他们恰好在歌曲达到高潮时飘过体育场的边缘。真嗣困惑的声音打断了她满足的沉思。“明日香，我知道你的英语还是比我好得多，所以告诉我那首歌不会真的以‘炸鸡！’结尾吧。”

She laughed. "Just roll with it, Baka-Shinji. Now let's make this look good. We're on."  
她笑了。“随它去吧，笨蛋真嗣。现在让我们看起来像那么回事。我们开始了。”

Even from their commanding height, Asuka could hear the crowd gasping in amazement as they swept slowly over the wall and carefully dropped a little lower over the stands and field. The spotlights struggled to illuminate the entire mass of her pride and joy.  
即使在他们高高的指挥位置上，明日香也能听到人群惊奇的吸气声，因为他们缓缓掠过墙头，小心翼翼地降低了一点高度，飞越看台和场地。聚光灯努力照亮她骄傲与喜悦的整个庞大身躯。

Ching's voice now reverberated up from the stadium. "Feast your eyes on _Red Whirlwind_, the mighty mecha Piloted by our two commanders, Lieutenants Sohryu and Ikari! They are both at the controls of their brand new NAM-91T _StarStrider_ mecha, the same type I usually Pilot. If any of you here are in from La Plata, you might recognize _Red Whirlwind_ as the unit that broke up the last of Don Barceló's forces by its mere arrival on the battlefield."  
清的声音此刻从体育场中回荡而上。“请各位一睹红旋风的风采，这台强大的机甲由我们的两位指挥官，副官草薙和碇驾驶！他们正操控着各自的全新 NAM-91T 星际漫步者机甲，与我通常驾驶的型号相同。在场若有来自拉普拉塔的观众，或许会认出红旋风，正是这台机甲在战场上仅凭其出现便瓦解了唐·巴塞洛的最后一股势力。”

Asuka guided her mecha in a slow circuit around the stadium, letting everyone get a good look at them. _'Strange,_' she thought. _'Even though it's a lot like how I used to picture just how I wanted to be honored and praised growing up as an Evangelion Pilot, this still feels less awesome than I did on stage performing.'_Her eyes slid to Shinji's face in the comm window. _'Because it was my talent alone and not the machine? Or because it was with him?'_ She snorted at herself. _'Oh, quit pretending, Sohryu. You know damn well you couldn't have cared less that fifty thousand people were applauding and cheering. You stopped even noticing they were there. Hell, you damn near had him on stage in full view of them. Alright, so I got a bigger charge out of the fact that it was him watching me play than an entire stadium. Now what? I still can't just let go of what he did in the past… but at least now I want that to change.'_  
明日香操控着她的机甲在竞技场内缓缓绕行，让所有人都得以仔细观赏。“奇怪，”她暗想，“尽管这和我小时候想象中作为 EVA 驾驶员被尊崇赞美的情景颇为相似，但感觉却不如在舞台上表演时那般震撼。”她的目光滑向通讯窗口中真嗣的脸庞。“是因为那是我独自的才华而非机器吗？还是因为与他同台？”她自嘲地哼了一声。“行了，别装了，惣流。你明明清楚自己根本不在乎那五万人的掌声和欢呼。你甚至已经不再留意他们的存在。见鬼，你差点就在他们面前把他带上台了。好吧，我承认，比起整个体育场的观众，他的注视更让我兴奋。现在怎么办？我还是无法放下他过去的所作所为……但至少，我现在希望这一切能有所改变。”

"Despite its fearsome appearance, _Red Whirlwind_ is in fact capable of totally non-lethal operations," Ching went on. "Lieutenant Ikari has ordered that we do our utmost to stabilize this world with minimum casualties. As such all of our troops will be spearheading every offensive move with non-lethal gear. This is not to say the bandit kings and would-be war lords like Don Barceló will escape justice. All of them will face fair trials in front of juries made up of the people they tried to rule over. They will face your judgment and punishment as you all see fit."  
"“尽管红旋风外表凶猛，实际上却能执行完全非致命的行动，”青继续说道，“碇中尉已下令我们尽最大努力以最小伤亡稳定这个世界。因此，我们的部队将在每次进攻中带头使用非致命装备。这并不是说像唐·巴塞洛这样的匪首和潜在军阀会逃脱正义。他们所有人都将在他们试图统治的人民组成的陪审团面前接受公正的审判。他们将面对你们认为合适的审判和惩罚。”

Asuka watched Shinji's face for a reaction. He didn't even sigh. "You alright with that, Shinji?" she probed gently. _'And I actually care about the answer. All the fun in the bedroom must be affecting my brain.'_  
明日香观察着真嗣的脸，想看看他的反应。他甚至没有叹气。“你能接受这个吗，真嗣？”她温柔地试探道。‘我居然真的在乎答案。卧室里的所有乐趣一定影响到了我的大脑。’

He shrugged. "I know that plenty of them will be bastards like Don Barceló or Winthrop. And a trial is a better option than wiping them out on the battlefield. There's been enough death on this world already. I don't want to add to it where I can avoid it. I… I hope most of our 'battles' are like yesterday; us just showing up in _Red Whirlwind_ will get everyone to surrender." He finally met her eyes. "I really don't want to ever have to kill again if I can help it, Asuka. But I know I can if I need to."  
他耸了耸肩。“我知道他们中很多人会是像唐·巴塞洛或温思罗普那样的混蛋。但审判总比在战场上消灭他们要好。这个世界已经经历了太多的死亡。我不想在我能避免的情况下再增加。我……我希望我们大多数的‘战斗’都像昨天那样；我们只需出现在红旋风中，就能让所有人投降。”他终于与她的目光相遇。“我真的不想再杀人了，如果我能避免的话，明日香。但我知道如果需要，我可以。”

_''For you''_ Asuka easily heard the unspoken words, even without the nearly as clear mental echo that came through the piloting link. _'And I'm still afraid of him ever learning it was me who finished Winthrop… or that that was my price to Jinnai for joining his coup. 'Leave Shinji out of it, and I get to shoot Winthrop.''_She ruthlessly suppressed that line of thought before any of it could bleed back through the link to him. _'He knows all of my sins? Not yet. Not that one. And as much as I fear him learning that, I doubt I can keep it hidden forever, not when we're like this.'_  
"“‘为了你’，明日香轻易地听出了未说出口的话，即使没有通过驾驶链接传来的几乎同样清晰的心灵回响。‘而我仍然害怕他知道是我终结了温思罗普……或者那是我在金奈加入他的政变时付出的代价。‘别让真嗣卷进来，我就能射杀温思罗普。’她无情地压制了这个念头，以免任何一丝思绪通过链接传回给他。‘他知道我所有的罪行吗？还没有。不是那一个。尽管我害怕他知道这一点，但我怀疑我能否永远隐藏它，尤其是当我们现在这样的时候。’”

Maybe she didn't need to worry about that for tonight. All she felt coming from Shinji's side of the link was a still energized buzz from the concert and what they'd been up to. She could still feel his 'edge', too. She'd had a blast, but he had been only focused on her enjoyment. A grin came back to her face. She was actually looking forward to 'getting him back' for that. This was downright addictive.  
或许她今晚不必为此担忧。从真嗣那边传来的感觉，只有音乐会后的兴奋余韵和他们所经历的一切。她仍能感受到他的‘锋芒’。她玩得很尽兴，但他只专注于她的快乐。她的脸上再次浮现出笑容。她其实很期待‘回敬他’这一点。这简直是上瘾了。

He noticed her grin and snicker. "What's so funny, Asuka?"  
他注意到她的笑容和窃笑。“有什么好笑的，明日香？”

"Oh, I'm thinking about scoreboards and planning my counterattack, Baka-Shinji. You and I were barely getting started when we had to stop for this, and I hate being interrupted," she replied. "Let's finish our parade and get back on the ground."  
“哦，我在想计分板和策划反击呢，笨蛋真嗣。我们才刚开始就被打断了，我讨厌被打断，”她回答道。“让我们结束游行，回到地面吧。”

"Oh no, my gorgeous and brilliant girlfriend is going to have her insatiable way with me!" Shinji moaned less than convincingly. "Whatever shall I do?"  
"哦不，我那美丽又聪明的女朋友就要对我为所欲为了！" 真嗣装模作样地哀叹道，"我该怎么办才好？"

"You could always surrender," Asuka purred right back at him. "Submit to my demands, Baka-Shinji!"  
"你大可以投降啊，" 明日香娇媚地回敬他，"乖乖听从我的要求，笨蛋真嗣！"

"Clearly, I have no choice. Resistance is useless, I must obey," Shinji sighed in defeat. His warm smile at her through the comm window gave the lie to his tone.  
"显然，我别无选择。抵抗是徒劳的，我必须服从，" 真嗣叹息着认输。透过通讯窗口，他对着她露出的温暖笑容却暴露了他语气中的虚假。

Asuka smirked at his response. "Good. Now let's land this baby and get back to the fleet, fast." She swung them around to head back up and out of the stadium, hardly noticing TJ had decided to spread his set of wings and fly loops around them as his own addendum to the finale.  
明日香对他的回答微微一笑。“很好。现在让我们降落这小家伙，快速返回舰队。”她操纵着他们转向，准备飞离体育场上空，几乎没注意到 TJ 已经决定展开他的翅膀，在他们周围飞舞，为这场终曲增添自己的一笔。

+++

Asuka idly ran her fingers through Shinji's hair and waited for her panting breath and pounding heartbeat to recover. She had his head comfortably pillowed on her chest where he'd slumped at the end of their latest round, which had begun almost as soon as they stepped onto the transport pad back in the command pit. Asuka couldn't stop the tired smile on her face. _'I'm starting to really like the feeling of a warm body keeping me company in bed while sweat cools on my skin. Too bad Baka-Shinji didn't catch my 'Walls of Jericho' hint. This would have made synch training a lot more fun… we could have had more days like this.'_  
明日香漫不经心地用手指梳理着真嗣的头发，等待着自己的呼吸和心跳平复。他的头舒适地枕在她的胸前，那是他们在最新一轮结束后瘫倒的地方，几乎一踏上指挥坑的运输台就开始了。明日香无法抑制脸上的疲惫笑容。“我开始真正喜欢上在床上有个温暖的躯体陪伴的感觉，当汗水在我皮肤上冷却时。可惜笨蛋真嗣没领会我的‘耶利哥城墙’暗示。这本可以让同步训练变得更有趣……我们可以有更多这样的日子。”

Her fingers paused for a second in their combing. _'Would that have made the difference? If we'd been lovers instead of isolated and broken people who couldn't understand each other? If he'd come for me instead of falling to pieces in the Eva cages?'_ She visualized again the crippled Mass Production Evas rising back up as her power ran out, but this time Shinji in Unit-01 landing on them like an avalanche, Unit-01's S2 organ giving it unlimited energy to take on SEELE's Evas. _'I hate to admit it, but he wasn't much less a Pilot than I was. If I could tear them up that much with less than four minutes of battery, he'd have been able to finish them off for good after the way I chewed them up. Then we might still have faced Instrumentality, but we'd have done it together and not at each other's throats.'_ Her smile became wry. _'And I'd have had almost five years of this instead of four days. All those missed orgasms!'_  
她的手指在梳理中停顿了一瞬。'那会有所不同吗？如果我们是恋人而非孤立无援、支离破碎的人，无法理解彼此？如果他来找我，而不是在 Eva 笼中崩溃？'她再次想象那些残破的大量生产型 Eva 在她力量耗尽时重新站起，但这次是 Shinji 驾驶的初号机如雪崩般降临，初号机的 S2 机关赋予其无限能量，迎战 SEELE 的 Eva。'我虽不愿承认，但他作为驾驶员并不比我逊色多少。如果我能用不到四分钟的电量撕裂它们，他在我重创它们之后，本可以彻底终结它们。那样我们或许仍要面对人类补完计划，但我们将会并肩作战，而非彼此对立。'她的笑容带上了几分自嘲。'那样的话，我本可以拥有近五年的时光，而非仅仅四天。那些错过的欢愉！'

Shinji raised his head after Asuka's hand held still for a minute. He made a questioning noise when he spotted the expression on her face.  
在 Asuka 的手停顿了一分钟后，Shinji 抬起头来。当他注意到她脸上的表情时，发出了一声疑问的声响。

Asuka weighed it in her head for a moment, then suddenly said, "I'm sorry I held your nose. I was… scared."  
Asuka 在脑海中权衡了一会儿，突然说道，"对不起，我捏了你的鼻子。我当时……害怕。"

Shinji just blinked at her in confusion. "Scared? Huh? Of… me?"  
真嗣只是困惑地眨了眨眼。“害怕？啊？怕……我？”

Asuka gave a tiny nod. "I wanted to… I… I wanted to kiss you. I wasn't just bored. I wanted… I thought I loved Kaji. I wasn't supposed to be attracted to someone like you. I wasn't supposed to be wondering what it would feel like to kiss you or feel your arms around me. But I did, all the time. It was driving me crazy that you never seemed to get any of the hints I threw at you. So I decided I was going to try it, but I… was scared that I might be starting to… care about someone who didn't want me back. So I tried to leave myself an excuse to back out. So if you didn't want me, I could say I was only kidding. I didn't… I didn't expect it to _hurt_ so much when you didn't do anything at all. If I hadn't held your nose, you wouldn't have stopped kissing me, would you?"  
明日香微微点头。“我想要……我……我想吻你。我不是因为无聊。我想要……我以为我爱着加持。我不应该被你这样的人吸引。我不应该去想吻你会是什么感觉，或者被你拥在怀里会是什么感觉。但我确实一直在想。你从不领会我给你的暗示，这让我快疯了。所以我决定要试试，但我……害怕我开始……在乎一个不想要我的人。所以我给自己留了个退路。如果你不想要我，我可以说我只是开玩笑。我没有……我没有想到当你什么都没做时，会这么痛。如果我没有捏住你的鼻子，你就不会停止吻我，对吧？”

Shinji stared at her with wide eyes, but nodded. "I… even when I thought you didn't like it, I stayed up half the night thinking about that kiss…"  
真嗣睁大眼睛盯着她，但还是点了点头。“我……即使我觉得你不喜欢，我还是在那晚半夜里想着那个吻……”

"So did I. And trying not to cry. Damn it… I wish I hadn't been… I'm sorry I didn't just pin you to the wall and kiss you until you held me, like I wanted to. I… really liked that kiss, Shinji. It killed me when I thought you rejected me. That's part of why I wanted to hurt you back when you asked me to help you. And it all just piled on." _'And even when you tried to help, you always made it go wrong somehow. After Ariel. The hospital. Trying to talk to me after the bathtub. Why can't it ever be easy for us?'_ "I'm sorry I held your nose," she repeated.  
"我也一样。而且还在努力忍住不哭。该死的……我真希望自己没那么……对不起，我当时没有直接把你按在墙上吻到你抱紧我，就像我想要的那样。我……真的很喜欢那个吻，真嗣。当我以为你拒绝我时，我的心都碎了。这也是为什么当你让我帮你时，我想伤害你。这一切都堆积在一起。" '即使你试图帮忙，也总是以某种方式搞砸。在小美人鱼之后。在医院。在浴缸后试图和我说话。为什么我们之间就不能简单一点呢？' "对不起我捏了你的鼻子，"她重复道。

Shinji blinked at her, then laid his head back down on her chest. "I forgive you, Asuka. I can't say it didn't hurt when you ran off to rinse your mouth out and then yell at me later for it. I spent I don't know how long wishing I'd pulled your hand away. It could have been…" His arms squeezed tighter around her.  
真嗣看着她眨了眨眼，然后再次把头靠在她的胸前。"我原谅你，明日香。虽然你跑去漱口然后又因此对我大吼大叫时，我确实很受伤。我不知道自己花了多长时间希望我当时能拉开你的手。那本可以是……"他的双臂更紧地抱住了她。

She squeezed back. "'Could have been' is a lot of things. We can't change our past like that. I asked Daniel about things like that. We change our past, and we're someone else now. We can only live our lives forward. And I… _we_ are taking control of our lives, Shinji. No more deals, no more compromising or betraying ourselves because we 'have to'. We are going to be who we want to, who we choose to be. Together."  
她紧握回去。'本可以'有很多含义。我们无法像那样改变过去。我问过丹尼尔这类事情。我们改变了过去，就会变成另一个人。我们只能向前生活。而我……我们在掌控自己的生活，真嗣。不再有交易，不再因为'不得不'而妥协或背叛自己。我们将成为我们想成为的人，我们选择成为的人。一起。

His head nodded against her chest. He was silent for a moment. "I'm sorry for choking you on the beach after we… woke up. I wanted to hurt you back too. I wanted to see you more than anyone… but at the same time I didn't want to see you at all ever again. And then… you… broke me again."  
他的头靠在她胸前点了点。他沉默了一会儿。'对不起，在海滩上我们……醒来后我掐住了你。我也想伤害你。我比任何人都想见到你……但同时我也不想再见到你。然后……你……再次击垮了我。'

She flinched. "You never make this easy, Shinji."  
她退缩了一下。'你从不让事情变得简单，真嗣。'

Silence. 沉默。

"I… forgive you. I… that _is_ why I touched your face. I don't think I could have said 'I'm sorry' at that point, but I was, sorry I hurt you, when… when I told you 'No' like that. I just wanted you to go away and stop hurting me." Shinji's only response was to gently squeeze her again. She spoke more softly than ever. "I hate you. But I don't want to. I… I've decided I want to change that, to find a way to when I don't hate you anymore."  
“我……原谅你。我……这就是为什么我触碰了你的脸。我想我当时说不出‘对不起’，但我确实感到抱歉，对不起我那样伤害了你，当……当我那样坚决地说‘不’的时候。我只是希望你离开，不要再伤害我。”真嗣唯一的回应是再次温柔地拥紧她。她的声音比以往任何时候都要轻柔。“我恨你。但我不想这样。我……我决定要改变这一点，找到一个方法，直到我不再恨你。”

Shinji raised himself off her chest and moved up to lay his head beside hers on the pillow. "I love you, Asuka."  
真嗣从她的胸前抬起身子，移到枕头上，将头靠在她的旁边。“我爱你，明日香。”

They held each other until sleep claimed them both.  
他们相拥而眠，直至睡意将两人一同征服。

### Chapter 35 Girls' Night Out & A Reality Check

"And mmm, Sergeant Tightpants has all the benefits of experience, stamina, and oh yes, the ability to voluntarily override his refractory period. Hooray for TrueBorn!" Ching said with a Cheshire grin.

“而且，嗯，紧裤裆中士拥有经验、耐力，以及哦对了，还有自主控制不应期的能力。为真生欢呼吧！”Ching 带着柴郡猫般的笑容说道。

"What's a refractory pe-….oh!" Hikari blushed as her recently acquired medical knowledge finally caught up with her tongue.

"什么是难治性尿...哦！" 光的脸颊泛起红晕，她新近获得的医学知识终于跟上了她的舌头。

Misato and Asuka shared a dirty chuckle and clinked their glasses together with Ching's toast.

美里和明日香相视而笑，与阿静的祝酒一同碰杯。

Misato slammed the rest of her drink away and put the cup down with a pleased sigh. "Ok, you've owed us an explanation of that for a while now, sister. Spill it. What's this 'True Born', 'Star Born' stuff you keep mentioning?"

美里将剩余的饮料一饮而尽，满意地叹了口气，放下杯子。“好了，你欠我们一个解释已经很久了，姐姐。说吧，你老提的‘真生’、‘星生’到底是什么意思？”

Ching shrugged and waved her hand in the air. "Sorry. I forget you ladies don't know some things that are background understandings for an Imperial. The Imperial Tribes are really old stuff, back from the Founding. The Lord wanted to shape Avalon's culture without it being entirely made up of people from other places. So he created the first peoples of Avalon ex nihilio, from two sources: the BloodBorn, from a drop of his blood, sharing a link to him by his body, and the StarBorn, created from a fragment of his mind, sharing a link to his spirit. We're both Homo Avalonis, but those are the two original tribes of Avalon."

青耸了耸肩，在空中挥了挥手。“抱歉，我忘了你们女士对一些帝国人视为常识的事情不太了解。帝国部落的历史非常悠久，可以追溯到建国之初。领主希望塑造阿瓦隆的文化，而不完全是由外来人口构成。因此，他从无到有创造了阿瓦隆的第一批人民，源自两个源头：血生者，由他的一滴血孕育而成，通过他的身体与之相连；星生者，由他心灵的一片碎片塑造，通过他的精神与之相连。我们同属阿瓦隆人，但这两个是阿瓦隆最初的部落。”

"My mother was from a StarBorn family, so I am one too. I can feel when others are close, and members of the Imperial Family light up like a star to my other sight. BloodBorns I've known have told me they get a different feeling, but some kind of similar sense of presence and each other, and so on."

我母亲来自星裔家族，因此我也是星裔。我能感知到他人的接近，而皇室成员在我的另一种视野中犹如星辰般璀璨。我所认识的血裔告诉我，他们感受到的是另一种不同的感觉，但同样伴随着一种存在感和彼此间的感应。

Asuka swirled the remnants of her beer in her glass. "Mmm, so what's a 'TrueBorn', then? A cross?"

明日香在杯中搅动着啤酒的残余。“嗯，那‘真生种’是什么？杂交种吗？”

Ching tipped her cup to Asuka. "Bingo. You pair up a StarBorn and a BloodBorn, their kids are TrueBorn, the brightest of Avalon's children after the Family itself. A good number of the people born on Avalon itself are TrueBorn by this point in things, all the old families of the Empire. Bir's one of those. He can trace his lineage all the way back to the Creation of Avalon and his first ancestors."

青向明日香举杯示意。“答对了。如果一个星生者和一个血生者结合，他们的孩子就是真生者，是家族之外阿瓦隆最杰出的子民。到了现在，阿瓦隆本土出生的大多数人都是真生者，包括帝国所有的古老家族。比尔就是其中之一。他能追溯自己的血统至阿瓦隆的创世之初，直至他的始祖。”

"You people are weird and way too old, Ching," Asuka shook her head.

"你们这些人真奇怪，而且太老了，Ching，" Asuka 摇了摇头。

"I'm only half-weird and old!" Ching protested with a smile. "My dad was an immigrant!"

"我只是半怪且老！" 青抗议道，带着微笑。"我爸是移民！"

Misato stuck her tongue out at her. "Weird enough. Back to your slice of beefcake, then. So he can recover faster than a randy teenager thanks to all the little biological enhancements you people are packed full of? Nice. And you're still wearing him out?"

惣流朝她吐了吐舌头，“够奇怪的了。那就回到你那块‘牛肉蛋糕’上吧。这么说，他因为你们这些人身上塞满的小生物增强技术，恢复得比一个急躁的青少年还快？不错。你还让他这么累吗？”

"Not nearly as much as Asuka is wearing out Shinji!" Ching laughed back. "He looked like something the cat dragged in this morning! And you looked like the cat doing the dragging, with all the canary feathers in your mouth."

远不及明日香把真嗣折腾得够呛！"青笑着回应，"他今早看起来就像是被猫拖进来的东西！而你呢，倒像是那只拖东西的猫，嘴里还叼着金丝雀的羽毛。"

Asuka was glad the drinks she'd already had which gave her fair skin a good flush. It gave her some cover for the blush that now tried to set her cheeks on fire. "Ahem. Ah. We… were up late, yes," she eventually got out. 'Six times! Wheee!' she cheered internally. 'So worth the lost sleep.' The last two weeks had been fun at night. Most of the time they both woke up smiling. Last night had been spurred by the successful bloodless capture of Bahia Blanca that afternoon, which had left both of them feeling happy and energized when they came back to base. Asuka had been buzzing from once again shutting down all opposition with just a few demonstration blasts at the landscape from Red Whirlwind's weapons, Shinji from the fact no one had gotten killed.

明日香庆幸自己之前喝的饮料让她的肌肤泛起了健康的红晕，这为她此刻试图点燃脸颊的羞红提供了掩护。"呃，我们……确实熬夜了。"她终于挤出这句话。六次！哇哦！'她内心欢呼。这失去的睡眠太值了。'过去两周的夜晚充满了乐趣，大多数时候他们醒来时都带着微笑。昨晚的激情源于那天下午成功无血夺取了巴伊亚布兰卡，这让他们回到基地时都感到快乐而充满活力。明日香因再次仅用红色旋风武器对景观的几下演示性轰炸就压制了所有反对声音而兴奋不已，而真嗣则因无人伤亡而感到欣慰。

Hikari blushed right along with her. Asuka grinned at her old school buddy. She and Touji had been 'living together' as much as any of them, but Hikari had yet to admit to doing anything more than heavy petting with Touji.

光也跟着脸红了。明日香对着她的老校友咧嘴一笑。她和东治就像他们中的任何人一样，已经算是“同居”了，但光至今还不肯承认和东治有过比亲昵抚摸更进一步的行为。

"'Up late', riiiiight," Misato giggled at her. "Don't wear him out too bad, you know. We need him to be able to walk straight at that City Council meeting we're setting up tomorrow. You and he have to do the 'mighty heroes' routine and impress everyone."

"熬夜呢，对吧？" 美里对她咯咯笑道，"别让他太累了，知道吗？明天我们要安排市议会会议，需要他能正常走路。你和他得扮演'英勇英雄'，让大家都印象深刻。"

"I'm not wearing him out! …much. And he's promised he's going to 'get me back' tonight," Asuka said primly. She held the haughty look for a second before dissolving into slightly buzzed giggles. 'I haven't wanted to go to bed so much in my life. And then there's tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after…'

"我可没把他累坏！……好吧，有点儿。但他承诺了今晚要‘报复’我，"明日香一本正经地说道。她维持着那副傲慢的表情一秒钟后，便忍不住带着微醺的笑意笑出声来。我这辈子从没这么渴望过上床睡觉。然后还有明天，后天，大后天……'

She waved at the newly hired bartender in the reopened bar of the athlete's lounge that had become the company's after-hours hangout of their stadium base. "Yen Ho! Another round for everyone! I'm feeling like this party's just getting started!"

她在重新开业的运动员休息室的酒吧里，向新来的调酒师挥手致意，这里已成为公司体育场基地下班后的聚集地。"严浩！再给每个人来一轮！我感觉这派对才刚刚开始呢！"

She sat back and enjoyed the slight buzz she was starting. Life…was pretty good, for a cut-off forlorn hope.

她向后一靠，享受着逐渐涌起的微醺。生活……对于一个被切断的绝望希望来说，算是相当不错了。

Five More Weeks Later: 五周后：

"Asuka, you shouldn't be laughing at this so much." Shinji's whisper did a poor job of hiding how close he was to breaking into rolling laughter himself.

"明日香，你不该笑得这么厉害。" 真嗣的低语掩饰不住他几乎要爆发出阵阵笑声的自己。

"I..." She barely managed to stifle a giggle. "I know, but this has got to be the funniest thing I've ever seen!" She wrapped her free hand over her mouth to hold in her amusement.

"我……" 她勉强忍住笑意，"我知道，但这绝对是我见过最搞笑的事情了！" 她用空着的那只手捂住嘴巴，努力抑制自己的笑意。

The subject of their almost uncontrolled mirth was sitting across the firepit from them in the lounge. Kensuke Aida looked nervously back and forth at the two gorgeous young ladies sitting on either side of him. Both of the girls were giving him looks that likely would have had his heart pounding in lustful excitement… if they hadn't also been shooting intermittent looks at each other that promised mayhem if the other made a move on Kensuke first.

他们几乎无法抑制的欢笑对象正坐在休息区的火坑对面。赤木耕助紧张地左右打量着坐在他两侧的两位美丽少女。两位女孩都向他投去了可能令他心潮澎湃、充满欲望的目光……如果不是她们也在不时地互相投去警告的眼神，暗示着如果对方先对赤木采取行动，将会引发混乱。

Asuka gave up trying to hold it in and began giggling madly, burrowing her face into Shinji's shoulder to try hiding the noise. "Oh Gott! This is awesome! This is what he gets for constantly whining about not having a girlfriend around us! Hee hee hee!"

明日香终于忍不住，开始疯狂地咯咯笑起来，把脸埋进真嗣的肩膀里，试图掩盖笑声。“哦，天哪！太棒了！这就是他整天在我们面前抱怨没有女朋友的结果！嘻嘻嘻！”

Shinji just squeezed gently with the arm he already had wrapped around her side and buried his nose in her hair to take a deep breath of her scent. He let his smile broaden, concealed behind Asuka's hair. It really was too funny.

真嗣只是轻轻地收紧了原本环绕在她腰间的手臂，将鼻子埋进她的发丝中，深深地吸了一口她的香气。他让笑容在她的发后扩大，这实在是太有趣了。

Katya Ilyushina had arrived via bus from Córdoba a couple of days earlier, searching for 'the great hero who flew the giant robot' who had arrived just in time to force the surrender of the bandit gang that had just selected the pretty sixteen-year-old for duty as a 'comfort girl'. She had been directed to Kensuke, flung herself all over him, and refused to be separated from him for more than a few hours at a time ever since. This made Kimatra Mehta, the equally lovely fifteen-year-old who had arrived from Rosario the day before, very unhappy, as she felt her similar but 24-hour-older claim on the young Pilot had precedence. All of which was complicated by the fact that the three had not a single language in common between them beyond a miniscule amount of English. Asuka had not stopped laughing the entire time.

卡佳·伊柳希娜几天前乘巴士从科尔多瓦抵达，寻找那位“驾驶巨型机器人的伟大英雄”，他及时出现迫使刚选定这位十六岁美丽少女作为“慰安女”的匪帮投降。她被指引找到了健介，扑进他怀里，自那以后便不愿与他分开超过几个小时。这让同样可爱的十五岁少女，前一天从罗萨里奥来的基马特拉·梅塔感到非常不快，因为她觉得自己对这位年轻飞行员同样但早 24 小时的宣称具有优先权。这一切因三人之间除了极少量的英语外没有任何共同语言而变得复杂。而明日香则全程笑个不停。

TJ sat nearby, offering assistance to the girls, as he spoke perfectly good Russian, Hindi, English, and Japanese. His 'help' sometimes seemed more aimed at getting Kensuke to turn redder, though. He'd been laughing almost as much as Asuka.

TJ 坐在附近，用流利的俄语、印地语、英语和日语为女孩们提供帮助。不过，他的“帮助”有时似乎更多是为了让健介脸红。他笑得几乎和明日香一样多。

Asuka shook her head slightly. Shinji's new friend had been a constant source of amazement over the last seven weeks. He'd been as fired up as they were from the concert. They hadn't learned until the day after that he'd continued his looping flight around Red Whirlwind and gone on to singlehandedly smash the warlords and gangs of Montevideo, all of them, in one night. When Sergeant Bir had laconically informed them of this the next afternoon, he'd added 'You get a Prince Of The Blood wound up like that, it's best to let him run until he gets tired and pick up the pieces afterward.' Montevideo's residents were still clamoring for a return of their 'White Angel', a title TJ found kind of embarrassing and the rest of the Imperials thought was a great laugh.

明日香轻轻摇了摇头。真嗣的新朋友在过去七周里一直是令人惊叹的源泉。他和他们一样，从音乐会中获得了极大的热情。直到第二天他们才知道，他继续绕着红旋风飞行，并在一夜之间独自摧毁了蒙得维的亚的所有军阀和帮派。第二天下午，比尔中士漫不经心地告诉他们这件事时，还补充道：“一旦皇室血脉的王子被激怒，最好让他尽情奔跑，直到他疲惫不堪，然后再收拾残局。”蒙得维的亚的居民仍在呼唤他们的“白色天使”回归，TJ 觉得这个称号有点尴尬，而其他帝国成员则认为这非常有趣。

Kaji and Misato were at a table behind Kensuke and the girls, matching each other beer for beer and talking quietly. Well, Kaji was at the table, Misato was happily seated in his lap. Yesterday Misato had admitted to her that she was actually envious of the way she and Shinji got to spend so much time together. Misato and Kaji's roles as Scout and Psi platoon leaders kept them moving about the company's expanding zone of control over the Pampas so much that they only got to see each other in person about three times a week, to Misato's considerable frustration. Asuka smiled smugly to herself. As joint commanders and Pilots, she got to spend nearly all day every day with her Shinji.'Oh, and every night, too. Heh heh heh. Oh yes, mine mine mine, he's mine, fuck you, Wondergirl.'

加持和美里坐在剑介和女孩们后面的桌旁，一杯接一杯地对饮，低声交谈。确切地说，加持坐在桌边，而美里则惬意地坐在他的腿上。昨天，美里向她坦白，其实很羡慕她和真嗣能有那么多时间相处。作为侦察和 Psi 小队的领导，美里和加持经常奔波于公司不断扩大的潘帕斯控制区，以至于他们每周只能亲自见面三次，这让美里颇为苦恼。明日香心中暗自得意。作为联合指挥官和驾驶员，她几乎每天都能和她的真嗣形影不离。哦，还有每个夜晚。嘿嘿嘿。没错，他是我的，我的，我的，真嗣是我的，去你的，奇迹女孩。

Touji and Hikari sat across the table from Shinji and herself, whispering to each other and laughing at Kensuke's predicament with them. Touji had likewise been besieged more than once by admirers like Kensuke's, but Hikari had seen them off with a ferocity and possessiveness that Asuka could only applaud, and did. Hikari had confessed that she'd been usuing Asuka as a role model for that. She'd had to elbow Shinji when he started laughing. Asuka had haughtily retorted that Shinji was hers and hers only, and all of the surprisingly numerous women who'd tried getting a piece of the now famous Third Child could go to Hell if they thought she was letting them have him. 'Not with the way I've been feeling the last seven weeks, or the way I've been getting gloriously and thoroughly laid every night. Mmm mm mm, life is pretty sweet for a lost band of souls trying to save the world. I'm actually happy about waking up in the morning these days…'

冬二和光坐在真嗣和她对面，窃窃私语，笑看健介与他们之间的窘境。冬二也曾多次被健介那样的仰慕者围攻，但光以一种阿苏卡只能赞叹的凶猛和占有欲将他们一一击退。光曾坦言，她一直以阿苏卡为榜样。当真嗣开始笑时，她不得不肘击他。阿苏卡傲然回应，真嗣是她的，且仅属于她，那些试图染指如今声名鹊起的第三适格者的众多女性，若以为她会拱手相让，那就大错特错，让她们统统见鬼去吧。过去七周，她的情感如此，每晚的欢愉更是酣畅淋漓。嗯，嗯，嗯，对于一群试图拯救世界的迷失灵魂来说，生活真是甜蜜。如今，她甚至对清晨醒来感到欣喜……

They'd even somehow managed to do a nearly perfect job of upholding baka-Shinji's 'Nobody Dies' stipulation, barely a dozen actual deaths so far. She let herself relax further against his side. 'It was still funny watching Shinji of all people imitate his father's dead-eye stare at the guys who tried to worm their way next to me. Who'd have thought Baka-Shinji could scare anyone? Mmm, warm cuddles are dangerously addictive, Sohryu. You're getting used to this. Not that you've yet found the guts to tell him that he makes you happy. All you ever do is... what you tell him every night. Thinking of which…'

他们甚至不知怎么地，几乎完美地遵守了笨蛋真嗣的“无人死亡”规定，至今实际死亡人数不过寥寥十余人。她让自己更放松地倚靠在他身旁。看到真嗣模仿他父亲那种无神的目光，吓退那些试图靠近我的人，依然觉得好笑。谁能想到笨蛋真嗣也能吓到人呢？嗯，温暖的拥抱真是危险地令人上瘾，明日香。你已经习惯了这一切。尽管你还没鼓起勇气告诉他，他让你感到幸福。你每晚对他说的，始终是那句话。说到这个……

She turned her head to put her lips against his ear. "I hate you," she whispered. Her tender tone inverted the words. Shinji just nodded and gently hugged her back. 'And damn him, he understands what I am and am not saying. He always does. Even back in that damn MP Eva in Berlin he understood what I said and what I couldn't. And I'm still such a coward. Damn yourself, Sohryu.' She sighed to herself and took another drink of her beer. Her stomach was a little upset, maybe that would settle it. Ching and Sergeant Bir were due any minute to discuss their plans to deal with the impending arrival of the UN fleet in a week or so. In a few days they'd pull all the Imperials back to Buenos Aires and get ready to handle the thousands of UN soldiers accompanying their MP Eva. They'd have to make sure they were aboard the fleet when they were about to make landfall, so she and Shinji could take over that Evangelion as well. That would hugely demoralize the UN force right from the start…

她转过头，将嘴唇贴在他的耳边，轻声道：“我恨你。”她那温柔的语气让这句话变得意味深长。真嗣只是点了点头，温柔地回抱了她。该死的，他总能理解我说与未说的话。他一直都是这样。即便是在柏林那该死的 MP 初号机里，他也能明白我所说的和无法言说的。而我，依然是个懦夫。该死的，惣流。”她在心里叹了口气，又喝了一口啤酒。胃里有些不适，或许这能缓解一下。程和伯尔中士随时会来讨论应对一周后联合国舰队即将到来的计划。几天后，他们将把所有帝国军队撤回布宜诺斯艾利斯，准备迎接随 MP 初号机而来的数千名联合国士兵。他们必须确保在舰队即将登陆时，她和真嗣能够接管那台使徒。这将极大地打击联合国军队的士气，从一开始就……

Asuka's ears pricked up. She could hear them coming down the hall towards the doors together. Of course, together. Despite the fact that she'd been looking, trying to catch them at it, she'd been unable to spot her friend and 'Sergeant Tightpants' in even the slightest unprofessional moment. She'd never seen them make out, hold hands, or even so much as call each other anything but 'Sergeant' and 'Lieutenant' or 'ma'am'. Hell, she still didn't even know what Bir's first name was. Ching was amused by Asuka's frustration, happily confirming that she and the tall NCO we're still regularly 'relieving tension' with each other, despite the lack of anything for Asuka to see. 'Bah, I'll catch her soon, somehow. They're together almost as much as Baka-Shinji and I. She teases me almost as much as Misato, if more humorously. I need ammo to fire back.' She rubbed at her stomach again. 'Man, dinner is beating me up tonight…'

明日香的耳朵竖了起来。她能听到他们正一起沿着走廊向门口走来。当然，是一起的。尽管她一直在观察，试图捕捉到他们的任何不专业时刻，但她始终未能发现她的朋友和“紧身裤中士”有任何亲密举动。她从未见过他们亲吻、牵手，甚至除了“中士”和“中尉”或“女士”之外，连彼此的昵称都没听过。该死，她甚至不知道比尔的名字是什么。青对明日香的挫败感到好笑，愉快地确认她和那位高大的非委任军官仍在定期“缓解紧张”，尽管明日香什么也没看到。哼，我迟早会抓到她的，总有办法。他们在一起的时间几乎和我们和笨蛋真嗣一样多。她取笑我的程度几乎和美里一样，只是更有趣些。我需要弹药来反击。她又揉了揉肚子。天哪，今晚的晚餐真是让我难受……

Ching and Bir walked in together, chatting the whole way. "Aww, you don't like me being all sprightly and cheery in the morning without even coffee first?" she smiled at him.

青和比尔一起走进来，一路上都在聊天。“哎呀，你不喜欢我一大早就这么精神抖擞、兴高采烈，连咖啡都没喝吗？”她笑着对他说。

Sergeant Bir snorted at her. "It's not right, you being so chipper and bushy-tailed every morning. Sickness, that's what it is. I think you're…"

比尔中士朝她哼了一声。“你每天早上都这么兴高采烈、精神抖擞，这不对劲。这是病，我觉得你……”

Asuka's blood ran cold. She felt her face go pale and every hair on her head stand on end. She bolted up from the table, slipping out of Shinji's arm and spilling her beer in her haste to move. She hit the door to the bathroom at a full run and barely made it to the nearest sink before her stomach revolted.

明日香的血液仿佛凝固了。她感到自己的脸色苍白，每一根头发都竖立起来。她猛地从桌边站起，挣脱了真嗣的怀抱，急忙中打翻了啤酒。她全速冲向洗手间的门，勉强在最近的洗手池前止步，胃里一阵翻江倒海。

Part 67 第 67 章

Should Have Seen It Coming

早该预见这一切

Shinji sat in shock, staring at the still swinging bathroom door. Asuka's spilled beer soaked his sleeve, but he didn't seem to notice. "What… why did she… Asuka?"

真嗣呆坐在那里，目光紧盯着仍在摇摆的浴室门。明日香泼洒的啤酒浸湿了他的衣袖，他却浑然不觉。“什么……她为什么要……明日香？”

Hikari quickly shared a brief look with Touji before she too stood up and practically ran into the bathroom after Asuka. Touji looked as confused as he did. "I dunno, man. She left in a real big hurry, and it sounds like she's really doin' some major pukin' in there. Maybe ya should just wait until she comes back out. Didn't she say was feelin' kinda sick earlier?"

光迅速与冬二交换了一个简短的眼神，随即也站起身来，几乎是跑着跟进了浴室，追随着明日香。冬二看起来和他一样困惑。“我不知道，伙计。她走得真的很急，听起来她在里面吐得很厉害。也许你应该等她出来再说。她之前不是说过感觉有点不舒服吗？”

Shinji noded vaguely, his eyes still locked on the door. "Um, yeah, her stomach's been bothering her off and on for a few days. I…should I…" He trailed off in confusion, his hands making uncertain grasping motions.

真嗣含糊地点了点头，目光依旧紧锁在门上。“嗯，是的，她肚子这几天断断续续地不舒服。我……我应该……”他困惑地停了下来，双手做出不确定的抓握动作。

Ching and Sergeant Bir shared a long silent look before she walked quickly towards the bathroom. Sergeant Bir's hand on Shinji's shoulder halted his motion to follow before he could take a step. "Lieutenant, I think you should just wait here for her. There's nothing you can do for her that Hikari can't in terms of holding her hair, and I doubt she wants you staring at her when she's like this just now."

青和伯尔中士交换了一个长久的沉默眼神后，她快步走向浴室。在真嗣刚要迈步跟随之前，伯尔中士的手搭在他的肩膀上阻止了他。“中尉，我觉得你应该在这里等她。在帮她抓头发这件事上，你帮不上什么忙，而光能做到。而且我怀疑她现在这样子，并不希望你盯着她看。”

'But I… she's… I want to help her…' "But… shouldn't I…" He could feel his hands clenching and releasing again. He hadn't seen that tic in weeks.

但我……她是……我想帮助她……”“但是……我不应该……”他感觉到自己的手又开始握紧又松开。他已经好几个星期没出现这种抽搐了。

Sergeant Bir's firm grip held him in place. "Lieutenant Leibshott is a doctor; she'll be able to take care of the commander without her feeling upset about looking weak in front of you. I've seen enough of you both over the last several weeks to know she hates showing weakness at all, but especially to you." He guided Shinji to a dry seat and began sopping up Asuka's spilled beer.

比尔军士坚定的手将他稳住。“莱布肖特中尉是医生，她能在不让指挥官在你面前显得软弱的情况下照顾好她。过去几周我观察你们俩足够久了，知道她最讨厌在任何人面前示弱，尤其是你。”他引导真嗣坐到一个干燥的座位上，开始清理明日香洒出的啤酒。

"I… I guess so," Shinji said, his eyes never leaving the bathroom door.

"我…我想是的，" 真嗣说道，目光始终未离开浴室门。

Asuka could hear footsteps coming over to her, but couldn't spare the time to look. Her heaving stomach had her full attention focused face-down in the sink. Cool fingers gathered her hair out of her face, pulling back the red curtain to give her a chance to spot Hikari's shape out of the corner of her eye.

明日香能听到脚步声朝她走来，但无暇抬头。她胃部翻腾，全神贯注地俯身在洗手池边。一双凉凉的手轻柔地拢起她的头发，将那红色的发帘向后一拉，让她得以从眼角瞥见光的形象。

"Are… you alright, Asuka? I mean, besides the obvious throwing up part," her friend asked.

“你…还好吗，明日香？我是说，除了明显呕吐的那部分，”她的朋友问道。

"I'm a fucking genius. I'm a fucking genius," Asuka rasped between heaves. "I'm a fuckinUGHRBL…"

“我他妈是个天才。我他妈是个天才，”明日香喘着粗气断断续续地说，“我他妈……”

"Asuka, what are you talking about?" Hikari looked up as Ching walked in. "She was complaining about her stomach being upset earlier. Do you think she ate something bad?"

"明日香，你在说什么呢？" 光抬头看着阿静走进来。"她之前还在抱怨肚子不舒服。你觉得她是不是吃了什么不好的东西？"

Ching shook her head a little as she drew next to them. "I don't think so. She and Shinji eat the same meals together, and he's fine. And she ran in here… hmm. What's she saying?"

青摇了摇头，走近他们。“我不这么认为。她和真嗣吃的是同样的饭菜，而他没事。而且她跑进这里……嗯，她在说什么？”

Her vomiting subsiding for the moment, Asuka grabbed a paper towel and wiped her mouth clean. Her hands were shaking badly. Still hunched over the sink, she looked up at Ching. "I'm a fucking genius."

她呕吐暂缓，明日香抓起一张纸巾擦净了嘴巴。她的手颤抖得厉害。依旧弯腰在洗手池前，她抬头看向青。“我他妈是个天才。”

Ching opened her mouth, but quickly closed it and narrowed her eyes at Asuka. "Do you want me to confirm? I'm an M.D. too, remember?"

青张开了嘴，但很快又闭上，眯起眼睛看着飞鸟。“你想让我确认吗？我也是医学博士，别忘了。”

Hikari looked at Asuka. "Confirm what?"

光看着明日香。“确认什么？”

Asuka glanced at Hikari, her hands still rubbing her abdomen. "Timelines. I haven't mentioned a couple of things we saw the night we arrived on Avalon, two days before you got there." She looked to Ching and nodded. "Do it. I want to be sure."

明日香瞥了一眼光，她的手仍在揉着腹部。“时间线。我还没提到我们抵达阿瓦隆那晚看到的一些事情，那是你到达前两天。”她看向青，点了点头。“开始吧。我要确保无误。”

Ching nodded and held her hands up over Asuka's lower abdomen. Her palms began to glow with neat loops of gold lines.

青点了点头，双手举起覆盖在明日香的腹部。她的手掌开始闪烁着整齐的金色线条。

Asuka's eyes widened and she pulled her hands out of the way. "Uh, I wan't expecting right now. What is that?"

明日香的眼睛瞪大了，她迅速抽回双手。“呃，我没想到是现在。那是什么？”

Hikari patted her on the shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, that's just one of her Navy implants. They're multi-spectrum medical scanners, I've seen her use them a lot in the hospital. But what are you trying to confirm?"

光拍了拍她的肩膀，安慰道：“别担心，那只是她的海军植入物之一。它们是多光谱医疗扫描仪，我在医院里常见她使用。不过，你想确认什么呢？”

Ching's hands kept up their slow passes over Asuka's belly, but she looked at Hikari with a serious expression. "Hikari, this is doctor-patient secret stuff on top of being your-best-friend secret stuff. Telling anyone beyond this room is only up to Asuka." She looked back to Asuka. "Do you want to tell her?"

晶的手继续在飞鸟的腹部缓缓移动，但她却用严肃的表情看着光。“光，这不仅是作为你最好朋友的秘密，更是医患之间的秘密。除了这个房间之外，是否告诉其他人，只有飞鸟有权决定。”她转头看向飞鸟，“你想告诉她吗？”

"Depends on if I'm right," Asuka said quietly.

"得看我是否正确，"明日香轻声说道。

Ching continued her examination for a moment. The glow on her hands died down, and she stepped back, out of Hikari's line of sight before giving Asuka a small, definite nod.

青继续检查了一会儿。她手上的光芒逐渐消退，她后退一步，避开了光的位置，然后向明日香微微点头，表示确认。

Her hands shaking like crazy, Asuka wrapped them carefully over her belly. She took a deep breath before looking up at Hikari. "I'm a fucking genius, Hikari. Shinji and I have been going at it every night for weeks like its going out of style, and we never thought even once about the obvious… and I can't remember when my last period was."

她的双手疯狂颤抖，明日香小心翼翼地将它们覆在腹部。她深吸一口气，然后抬头看向光。“我真他妈是个天才，光。真嗣和我已经连续几周每晚都缠绵不休，仿佛这事儿就要过时了似的，我们却从未想过那显而易见的事实……我甚至记不清上次月经是什么时候了。”

Hikari's brows were knitted in confusion. "What do yo-ohmigod…" Her eyes went round as saucers. "A-Asuka, are you…"

光眉头紧锁，一脸困惑。“你……我的天啊……”她的眼睛瞪得像铜铃一样大。“阿苏卡，你……”

Asuka nodded. "'Morning… sickness,' Sergeant Bir said. That's what made it finally click in my allegedly genius brain. Shit…" She looked at Ching. "How far along am I? Can you tell?"

明日香点了点头。“‘晨吐’，伯尔中士说的。就是这个让我那所谓天才的大脑终于反应过来了。该死……”她看向青。“我怀孕多久了？你能看出来吗？”

"From the size of the embryo, about seven weeks. And there's certain signs… Lord and Lady, I wish we had a cleric who could confirm this for me! There's certain signs that…" Ching trailed off in thought, then smiled at Asuka. "The night of the Ball. Oh my…"

从胚胎的大小来看，大约七周了。而且有一些迹象……天哪，真希望我们这儿有位牧师能帮我确认一下！有些迹象表明……”青若有所思地停了下来，然后对飞鸟微笑道：“舞会的那晚。哦，我的天……”

"What? What's that 'oh my' for?" Asuka asked carefully.

"什么？那个'哦天哪'是什么意思？" 明日香小心翼翼地问道。

Ching made calming motions. "Nothing bad, don't worry. But if my guess is right and you two did this the night of the Ball, well… a child conceived on Avalon, its parents personally blessed by the Lord and Lady, and on your first time together? That child is going to be showered in fortune and blessings, favored by the gods, filled with special power and grace."

青做出安抚的手势。“没什么坏事，别担心。但如果我的猜测没错，你们俩在舞会那晚做了这件事，那么……一个在阿瓦隆受孕的孩子，其父母亲自受到主和女士的祝福，而且还是你们第一次在一起？那个孩子将会被幸运和祝福所环绕，受到神明的宠爱，充满特殊的力量和优雅。”

"Gods that are a bit far away at the moment," Asuka said wearily. "Scheiße…" 'Now what, Sohryu? I'm so fucking smart, now what do I do? I've been bragging to myself about beating fear and deciding my own fate for weeks now. I think fate just punched back.' Her breath caught. 'Oh, scheiße! Shinji! He… I…. scheiße scheiße scheiße…what's he going to say? And what… gah! Alright… getting a grip on myself… I am in charge, not my fears. Just got to keep reminding myself that… scheiße.'

"神明此刻似乎有些遥远，"明日香疲惫地说道，"该死……"现在怎么办，苏龙？我他妈的这么聪明，现在该做什么？这几周来我一直自吹自擂，战胜恐惧，决定自己的命运。我想命运刚刚反击了。"她屏住呼吸。哦，该死！真嗣！他……我……该死该死该死……他会说什么？还有……啊！好吧……我得控制住自己……我是主导者，不是我的恐惧。只需不断提醒自己这一点……该死。

Another deep breath and Asuka looked both of her friends in the eyes. "Ok, here's what happens next; Ching, you tell everyone that I'm sick and Shinji and I are going back to the fleet to let me try and sleep it off. You and Sergeant Bir handle the planning session and tell us what you went over tomorrow morning. Hikari, just tell your Stooge I'm sick, nothing else until…I figure out the rest."

深吸一口气后，明日香直视着两位朋友的眼睛。“好，接下来是这样的；青，你告诉大家我生病了，我和真嗣要回舰队让我试着睡一觉恢复。你和比尔中士负责规划会议，明天早上告诉我们你们讨论了什么。光，就告诉你那家伙我生病了，其他什么都别说，直到……我搞清楚剩下的。”

Hikari shifted uncomfortably. "I… I don't know if I'm that good at lying to him, Asuka. He'll be able to tell."

光不安地挪动着。“我……我不知道自己是否擅长对他撒谎，明日香。他能察觉到的。”

"You just have to hold him off until tomorrow. I'll… know what I'm doing then."

你只需设法拖住他直到明天。到那时，我会……知道该怎么做了。

"I'll tell Bir no more than he needs to know for unit planning, but he's more than smart enough to figure it out on his own fairly fast, Asuka," Ching said. "There's only so many things that could make you react like this that I wouldn't tell him about anyhow. He'll figure it out by what I'm not saying, if nothing else."

"我只会告诉 Bir 进行单元规划所需的信息，但他聪明得很，很快就能自己想明白，Asuka，" Ching 说道，"能让你如此反应的事情本就不多，我也不会瞒着他。如果其他方面没线索，他也能从我没说的话里推断出来。"

"Right… but if he can keep his lips sealed, that's not a problem. I just need to… figure out… this." Asuka stopped her hands from nervously rubbing at her stomach again. Once halted, they just resumed shaking. She clenched them into tight fists.

"好吧…但如果他能守口如瓶，那就不是问题。我只需要…弄清楚…这个。" 明日香再次阻止了自己紧张地揉搓肚子的手。一旦停下，它们又开始颤抖。她将它们紧紧握成拳头。

Ching watched her for a second, concern all over her face. "Alright, lets get you back to Shinji and you both to some privacy." She began guiding Asuka towards the door. "You two are both each other's emotional anchor right now, and you're going to want him near you badly when you're feeling like this".

清看着她，脸上写满关切。“好了，我们带你回到真嗣那里，给你们俩一些私人空间。”她开始引导明日香朝门口走去。“你们俩现在都是彼此的情感支柱，当你感觉这样的时候，你会非常需要他在你身边。”

Asuka's blood ran cold again. 'I really wish I could either deny that was true at all or admit it was out loud. This halfway state is biting hard right now,' she thought mordantly. "I… I still don't know what to say to him…" Her steps dragged, but her feet numbly kept walking.

明日香的血液再次变得冰冷。'我真希望要么能彻底否认那是真的，要么就大声承认。这种半吊子的状态现在咬得我好痛，' 她苦涩地想。"我……我还是不知道该对他说什么……" 她的步伐拖沓，但双脚却麻木地继续前行。

Ching nodded. "That's as may be, but I know damn well that that there's no way you could hide this from him for more than a few minutes. You two are so close now he'll know something's wrong pretty much right away, and he'll want to help you with whatever is bothering you. Plus, he has a right to know and support you."

青点了点头。“或许如此，但我非常清楚，你不可能瞒他超过几分钟。你们现在关系这么亲密，他几乎立刻就能察觉到不对劲，而且他会想要帮你解决困扰你的事情。再说了，他有权利知道并支持你。”

She followed Ching through the door with Hikari on her heels. She forced herself to walk slowly and steadily to the table, firmly controlling the urge to run to Shinji and wrap herself in his arms. 'I am strong. I do not need to collapse into his arms and ask him to make the world go away. I am in charge of my fears.' Years of practice at keeping her face a mask came back all too easily, and this time left a bitter taste in her mouth. 'Great, now I have to lie-by-pretending to all my friends. Am I really that afraid of their reaction? Or am I afraid of my own?'

她跟随青穿过门，光紧随其后。她强迫自己缓慢而稳健地走向桌子，坚定地抑制住冲向真嗣并投入他怀抱的冲动。'我很坚强。我不需要崩溃在他怀里，求他让世界消失。我掌控着自己的恐惧。'多年来保持面无表情的练习此刻轻易回归，却留下了一丝苦涩。太好了，现在我得对所有朋友假装谎言。我真那么害怕他们的反应吗？还是我害怕的是自己？'

Shinji's face lit up in a relieved smile when he locked eyes with her as she emerged. The smile dimmed with concern as he took in her paleness and rigid expression. "Are you alright?" he quietly asked as she got closer. His eyes widened as her hand sought his and seized his in a grip so hard it shook.

当她出现并与他目光交汇时，真嗣的脸上露出了释然的微笑。然而，随着他注意到她苍白的脸色和僵硬的表情，这微笑中又掺杂了担忧。“你还好吗？”当她走近时，他轻声问道。他的眼睛因惊讶而睁大，因为她的手突然抓住他的手，那紧握的力度之大，让他不禁一颤。

She heard Ching speaking behind her, but she kept her mask-like expression aimed at Shinji, trying to talk with her eyes. "Lieutenant Sohryu is feeling a bit under the weather, as you might have guessed. Lieutenant Ikari is going to see her back to her cabin aboard the UN Fleet to get some rest, and he'll stay to watch over her. We'll carry on with the meeting as planned in the command pit once we've seen them off."

她听到阿清在身后说话，但她依然保持着面具般的表情面对真嗣，试图用眼神交流。“如你所料，苏瑞中尉身体有些不适。碇中尉将送她回联合国舰队的舱室休息，并留在那里照看她。等我们送走他们后，将按计划在指挥坑继续会议。”

Asuka barely waited for Ching to finish before she started moving for the door, Shinji a half step behind her, her hand interlocked with his with near-desperate strength.

明日香几乎没等阿静说完就朝门口走去，真嗣紧随其后半步，她的手与他的紧紧相扣，力度近乎绝望。

### Chapter 36 midnight Confessions - Everybody Knows

Shinji was not surprised that Asuka got them down to the transport pad in the command pit in a hurry, nor that she got them both undressed and into bed just as fast once they were back in their cabin. That was how most of their nights began lately anyway. However, the fact Asuka did it all in stone silence and a blank expression was very unusual.

真嗣并不惊讶明日香急匆匆地将他们带到指挥坑的运输平台上，也不惊讶一回到舱室她就迅速帮两人脱衣上床。毕竟，最近大多数夜晚都是这样开始的。然而，明日香全程一言不发、面无表情，这非常反常。

Their usual enthusiastic exertions did not promptly start once they were in bed, either. Instead, Asuka just held him, clinging to him like she was drowning.

即便躺下后，他们往常那股热情洋溢的劲头也未能立刻点燃。相反，明日香只是紧紧抱着他，仿佛溺水之人般依附着他。

'Alright, Ikari, you know her well enough by now to know something is very wrong. She hasn't said a word to you since she ran to the bathroom, and she came out looking like she'd seen a ghost.' Asuka was pressed up against him tightly, but every line her body screamed with tension, so tense she was shaking. "Asuka, what's wrong? Something huge is bothering you, I can tell. What's…what can I do? I want to help you." Shinji stiffened in worry as a thought struck him. "Y-you're not dying or something, are you?!" His voice rose to nearly a frightened squeak.

好了，碇，你现在对她足够了解，知道肯定出了什么大问题。自从她跑进洗手间后，一句话也没对你说过，出来时面色苍白，仿佛见了鬼一般。明日香紧紧地贴着他，但身体的每一寸都紧绷着，紧张到颤抖。"明日香，怎么了？有什么大事让你心烦意乱，我能感觉到。到底…我能做什么？我想帮你。" 真嗣因担忧而僵硬，一个念头突然闪过。"你…你不会是得了什么绝症吧？！" 他的声音几乎因惊恐而变成了尖细的颤音。

"No, I don't have cancer or anything, baka," Asuka said in a low voice, the first thing she'd said in more than an hour. Her voice was flat, toneless.

"不，我没有得癌症或什么的，笨蛋，"明日香低声说道，这是她一个多小时以来第一次开口。她的声音平淡，毫无起伏。

Shinji let out a relieved breath and relaxed. "Good, because I think losing you would turn me into my father way too much," he managed to joke weakly. "So what is wrong, then?"

真嗣松了口气，放松下来。“那就好，因为我觉得失去你，我会变得跟我父亲太像了。”他勉强开了个玩笑。“那到底出了什么问题？”

"I hate you." 我恨你。

Shinji blinked. This wasn't the rendition he had gotten used to, the increasingly soft-toned stand-in for terms of endearment Asuka was still unable to say. This was honest, plain dislike, like the old days. Yet… also sadder. She almost sounded like she was about to…'Oh gods, she is…she's crying. Oh shit, what do I do? WhatdidI do?'

真嗣眨了眨眼。这不是他习惯的那种表达，那种阿苏卡仍难以启齿的爱称所逐渐柔和的替代。这是直白、朴素的厌恶，就像过去一样。然而……也更悲伤。她几乎听起来像是要……'哦，天啊，她真的……她在哭。哦，糟糕，我该怎么办？我做了什么？'

"I hate you," Asuka mumbled again. "I was happy. You were making me happy. And now I'm… I don't even know what. We should have known. We saw this already. I hate you and I'm scared and I need you and I don't know what happens next or what to do and… and…" She broke off with a choked breath. She wiped at her cheeks and pulled back to look at him squarely.

"我恨你，"明日香再次低声说道，"我本来很快乐。你让我感到快乐。而现在我……我甚至不知道自己是什么状态。我们早该明白的。我们之前已经预见到了。我恨你，我害怕，我需要你，我不知道接下来会发生什么，也不知道该怎么办，而且……而且……" 她哽咽着停了下来。她擦了擦脸颊，后退一步，直视着他。

Shinji steeled himself to hold her gaze. That focused, intense look was back, making it scary to meet her eyes, but somehow he knew that it would be a much worse thing if he couldn't. "Asuka. I love you. I don't care how many times you say you hate me, or anything. I'm still going to stay right next to you for as long as you'll have me."

真嗣鼓起勇气迎上她的目光。那专注而炽烈的眼神再次出现，令人不敢直视，但他莫名地知道，如果无法面对，后果将更加严重。“明日香，我爱你。无论你说多少次讨厌我，或是其他什么，我都会一直留在你身边，只要你还需要我。”

Asuka stared at him, searching his face. "Every night I tell you 'I hate you'. Every night I try to push you away. Every night you tell me you love me… why haven't you asked me again? You've never even tried since the fight in Berlin. Why don't you ever require me to give back to you what I demand from you every day we're together?"

明日香凝视着他，仔细端详他的面容。“每晚我都对你说‘我恨你’。每晚我都试图将你推开。每晚你都告诉我你爱我……为什么你不再问我一次？自从柏林那次争吵后，你从未再尝试过。为什么你从不要求我回报你，就像我每天要求你那样？”

"The last time I asked, you said 'no'," Shinji replied with a faint smile.

"上次我问你，你说'不行'，" 真嗣带着淡淡的微笑回答道。

She glared at him. 她怒视着他。

He laughed softly. "Asuka, love can't be taken, only given. 'Si vis amari ama'." He gave her a soft, wry smile, then echoed her declaration from their judo match seven and a half weeks ago. "The last time I asked, I also said I wouldn't ask you again. If you want to love me… you're going to have to decide that for yourself. I don't feel like I have to push you. I can wait until you're ready."

他轻声笑了笑。“明日香，爱不是索取，而是给予。'Si vis amari ama'。”他向她投去一个温柔而苦涩的微笑，随后重复了七周半前那场柔道比赛时她的话。“上次我问你时，我也说过不会再问了。如果你想爱我……你得自己决定。我不想逼你。我可以等到你准备好的那一天。”

"How long?" she asked, visibly trying to keep her throat from closing up with worry.

"多久了？"她问道，明显在努力不让焦虑使喉咙紧缩。

"Always," he answered with that strange confidence he'd felt more and more the past few weeks since the concert.

“一直如此，”他回答道，带着那种近几周来，尤其是自音乐会以来愈发强烈的奇异自信。

Silence filled the cabin for a long minute. Her arms around him shook. "Shinji… I…"

船舱内沉默了许久。她的手臂环绕着他，微微颤抖。“真嗣……我……”

The smile on his face began to broaden. "Yes?" he asked, not hiding the anticipatory tone in his voice.

他脸上的笑容开始扩大。“是的？”他问道，毫不掩饰声音中的期待语气。

"…I'm pregnant." ……我怀孕了。

Shinji froze as still as she was. "You're…" It came out as a strangled gasp. He reminded himself to breathe again. A couple of deep breaths gave him the ability to try again. "You're right. We did see this already. We should have expected it." His shocked expression shifted to a faintly happy one. "At least this means we're going to be rescued sometime in the next four months."

真嗣如同她一样僵住了。“你……”他的声音哽咽而窒息。他提醒自己再次呼吸。几个深呼吸后，他才得以再次尝试开口：“你说得对。我们确实已经见过这一幕。我们应该预料到的。”他震惊的表情逐渐转为一丝淡淡的喜悦。“至少这意味着我们将在接下来的四个月内获救。”

Asuka gave him a dour look that would have hit harder if she hadn't still been shaking so much. "You're taking this awfully lightly, Third Child."

明日香给了他一个阴沉的眼神，如果不是她还在颤抖，这个眼神的杀伤力会更大。“你对这件事的态度未免太轻率了，第三适格者。”

He laughed weakly. "Oh, I'm holding on by a thread. I want to run around the room screaming right now, I'm not sure if in joy or terror. But you obviously do not. I can freak out later if I need to. You need me, and that's more important. I promised. I've got your back for everything, including this."

他虚弱地笑了笑。“哦，我正勉强支撑着。我现在真想绕着房间尖叫，不知道是因为喜悦还是恐惧。但你显然没有。如果需要，我晚点再崩溃。你需要我，这更重要。我承诺过。我会为你的一切，包括这件事，撑腰。”

Asuka just stared at him pensively for a minute. "You're doing that thing where you just accept everything again, Third. This is not the reaction I expected."

明日香只是若有所思地盯着他看了一分钟。“你又在那种无条件接受一切的状态了，第三。这可不是我期待的反应。”

He shrugged. "You told me to be a hero, and you need me not to panic right now so that you have…" He paused, aware he was about to stretch the boundaries of their nebulous relationship a bit further than before. "…someone to lean on. Someone you trust. I promised, Asuka. I will be anything for you."

他耸了耸肩。“你让我成为英雄，而现在你需要我保持镇定，这样你就有……”他顿了顿，意识到自己即将把他们那模糊不清的关系边界再推远一些。“……一个可以依靠的人。一个你信任的人。我答应过你，明日香。我会为你成为任何你需要的样子。”

"You… you're… Gott damn it, Shinji! You're always so fucking… gah!" Asuka rolled over to put her back towards him, but stayed within the circle of his arms. She scooted back against him, seeking out the warmth she wanted. "I told you you'd better become a hero, but I didn't expect it to do this."

“你…你…该死的，真嗣！你总是这么让人…啊！”明日香翻了个身，背对着他，却依然留在他的臂弯里。她往后挪了挪，紧贴着他，寻找她渴望的温暖。“我告诉过你最好成为英雄，但没想到会这样。”

'Do what? I'm trying to be the better man you wanted, Asuka. I want you to want me back so badly… Just tell me what you want, Asuka! I'll bend the world for you, just let me be with you! I need you, to be strong! Without you, I'm…'"Do what?" he managed aloud into the sweet-scented mass of her hair. He breathed in deeply, trying to stay as calm as he could. It was far from easy.

做什么？我正努力成为你期望的那个更好的人，明日香。我如此渴望你也能想要我回来……告诉我你想要什么，明日香！我会为你颠覆世界，只求能与你相伴！我需要你，来变得坚强！没有你，我……”他勉强对着她那散发着甜香的发丝出声。他深吸一口气，尽力保持镇定。这绝非易事。

"You just accept everything. You're… you're like a Gottdamned Buddha. You accept every sin I've ever done against you and… You don't even know what I've done. You don't even know what kind of person I am."

你只是全盘接受。你……你就像个该死的佛陀。你接受了我对你犯下的所有罪过，而且……你甚至不知道我做了什么。你甚至不了解我是怎样的人。

"Why are you talking like this?"

"你为什么这么说话？"

"There's things I still haven't told you. Things I didn't want you to ever know, even… before our… old arrangement," Asuka said quietly.

"有些事我还没告诉你。有些事我不想让你知道，甚至……在我们……旧协议之前，"明日香轻声说道。

"Do… is there something you want to tell me? I'm… there's nothing you can say that will drive me away, Asuka. You… make me strong. When I'm with you I can do anything, be anything. I will be whatever you need, accept anything you do, as long as I can stay with you. You matter more than I do. You're more worth… everything than I am."

"你…是不是有什么想告诉我的？我…无论你说什么，我都不会离开你，明日香。你…让我变得坚强。和你在一起时，我无所不能，能成为任何模样。我会成为你所需的一切，接受你所做的一切，只要能留在你身边。你比我更重要。你比我更值得…拥有一切。"

She seemed to curl inward in his arms, hunching up a little. "Doing that, Shinji. Being so, so… making me feel… like once you find out the things I've done, you'll only be here with me because of your promise. Like you won't want someone who's done what I've done."

她似乎在他怀里蜷缩起来，微微弓着背。“就像这样，真嗣。如此，如此……让我感觉……好像一旦你知道了我所做的事情，你留在我身边只是因为你的承诺。好像你不会想要一个像我这样做过那些事的人。”

"I mean it, Asuka. There's nothing you can possibly have done that would make me leave you. Especially now."

我是认真的，明日香。无论你做了什么，都不可能让我离开你。尤其是在现在。

"I shot Winthrop. I killed him."

我开枪打死了温思罗普。我杀了他。

Shinji could feel her tense up even further in his arms. He went very still. The silence stretched longer and longer, only the faint thrum of the ship's engines sounding throughout the cabin.

真嗣能感觉到她在他怀里愈发紧张。他一动不动。沉默持续拉长，只有船舱内隐约传来的引擎低鸣声。

He licked his lips and carefully asked, "What?"

他舔了舔嘴唇，小心翼翼地问道：“什么？”

For another long minute Asuka was silent.

又过了一分钟，明日香沉默着。

"When I said 'I have to take care of something when I get back', after the fighting… I… went to meet Jinnai, at the bottom of the NERV Berlin complex," she said slowly. "That's where they'd stuffed Winthrop after they'd captured him. Jinnai had his goons work him over, probably trying to get the N2 codes out of him, but they kept him alive until after the fighting… so I could get there."

当我说“回去后我得处理一些事情”，在战斗结束后……我……去见了阵内，在 NERV 柏林基地的底层，”她缓缓说道，“那是他们抓获温斯洛后关押他的地方。阵内让手下对他严刑拷打，大概是想从他嘴里撬出 N2 密码，但他们一直让他活着，直到战斗结束……这样我才能赶到那里。

She paused, waiting for any reaction from him. After another long pause, he merely asked tonelessly, "And?"

她停顿了一下，等待他的任何反应。又是一阵漫长的沉默后，他只是无动于衷地问：“然后呢？”

"It was just Jinnai and Winthrop down there. Jinnai handed me a gun and told me to make it quick. Winthrop… was surprised to see me. He thought you might have been a problem, but not me. He called me a slut and a liability to real soldier. I told him…" Asuka swallowed. "..that it was because he'd killed my mother."

下面只有金奈和温斯洛普。金奈递给我一把枪，让我快点动手。温斯洛普……看到我很惊讶。他以为你可能会是个麻烦，但没想到是我。他骂我是荡妇，是真正士兵的累赘。我告诉他……"飞鸟咽了咽口水。"……那是因为他杀了我母亲。"

Shinji nodded into her hair. "That's what you told me that night. It sounded strange then, but I… I can understand why you'd do it, Asu-"

真嗣埋首于她的发间，点了点头。“那晚你就是这样告诉我的。当时听起来很奇怪，但我……我能理解你为什么要这么做，阿苏——”

"Winthrop didn't believe me," she interrupted.

"温思罗普不相信我，"她打断道。

"What?" "什么？"

"He... thought I must have had another reason, another person I was doing it for. I told him to go to Hell, and emptied the pistol into his head until his brains were all over the walls. Then I came back to the apartment and we made our… arrangement."

他……以为我必定有别的理由，或是为了另一个人而这么做。我叫他滚去地狱，然后对着他的头连开数枪，直到他的脑浆溅满了墙壁。之后我回到公寓，我们便达成了……某种协议。

More silence. 更多沉默。

"Was he right?" Shinji asked, even more quietly than before.

"他是对的吗？" 真嗣问道，声音比之前更加轻柔。

This time it was Asuka who drew out the silence. "When you left that stupid note that wouldn't have fooled anyone for a fucking second, I read it as soon as you left. I left for Jinnai's place right after that. I told him I was in, on two conditions; that I got to personally kill Winthrop… and that you be left out of it. They only picked you up because I'd been shot and Jinnai wanted a back-up in case I was… useless."

这次打破沉默的是明日香。“当你留下那张愚蠢的纸条，那玩意儿连一秒钟都骗不了人，你一走我就看了。之后我立刻去了阵内的住处。我告诉他我加入，但有两个条件：我要亲手杀掉温斯洛……还有，你得置身事外。他们之所以抓你，是因为我中枪了，阵内需要一个备胎，以防我……没用了。”

Shinji hugged her closer. He knew all too well how she hated that feeling more than anything. "It took both of us to make that Eva move. You were no more useless than I was. But why are you telling me this?"

真嗣将她抱得更紧了。他深知她对这种感觉的厌恶胜过一切。“是我们俩共同让那台 Eva 动起来的。你并不比我更无用。但为什么你要告诉我这些呢？”

"Even in the middle of the fighting, I felt bad for a moment about making you kill with me. And when I was leaving that basement, I told Jinnai that you mustn't hear about any of it, ever," Asuka said slowly. "I… it was still… important that you didn't think I was a bad person. I still didn't want you to hate me. You were... like a reminder of what life used to be, before it turned into total madness and evil. I… couldn't bear the thought of you deciding I was… part of that. It would be like everything in my life I ever cared about turning against me."

即使在激战之中，有那么一刻，我为让你与我一同杀戮而感到难过。当我离开那个地下室时，我告诉神无，你绝不能知道这一切，永远不能。我……这仍然……很重要，我不想让你认为我是个坏人。我仍然不希望你恨我。你就像是对过去生活的提醒，在它变成彻底的疯狂与邪恶之前。我……无法忍受你认为我是……那其中的一部分。那将如同我生命中所有在乎的一切都与我为敌。

"I never will, Asuka. Never." He tightened his arms around her. "You shot Winthrop? The only thing I don't like about it is that you felt like you had to hide it from me. I need you. And I'm going to stay with you. Not because I promised. I'm going to stay with you because I want to. Especially now." He slid his hand lower to rest just below her navel. "You need me to be calm and help you. Even if I want to freak out right now." He laughed nervously.

我永远不会离开你，明日香。永远不会。" 他紧紧地抱住她。"你开枪打了温斯洛普？唯一让我不高兴的是，你觉得自己必须对我隐瞒这件事。我需要你。我会留在你身边。不是因为我承诺过。我会留在你身边，因为我愿意。尤其是现在。" 他的手滑到她肚脐下方。"你需要我保持冷静，帮助你。即使我现在很想崩溃。" 他紧张地笑了。

Asuka uncurled and seemed to relax. "I fully expected to freak out tonight. But I'm not freaking out. I am still in shock, but I am control of myself, not my fears," she said, far more calmly than she'd seemed a few minutes ago. She rolled back over to face him again. "And I'm not alone, am I?"

明日香伸直身体，似乎放松了下来。“我本以为今晚我会崩溃。但我没有。我仍然处于震惊之中，但我控制住了自己，不是我的恐惧，”她说道，比几分钟前平静得多。她又转过身来面对他。“而且我并不孤单，对吧？”

'I want to make her happy. I want that more than anything.' Shinji swallowed and made himself hold her eyes. It was much easier than it had been seven weeks ago. "No, you're not. And you never will be again. I'm with you, always." He swallowed again, then forced himself to ask hesitantly, "With you… both?" He very gently pressed on her lower belly.

我想让她快乐，这是我最渴望的。" 真嗣咽了咽口水，强迫自己直视她的眼睛。这比七周前容易多了。"不，你不会的。而且你永远不会再那样了。我永远和你在一起。" 他再次咽了咽口水，然后犹豫地问道："和你……两个人一起？" 他非常温柔地按了按她的下腹部。

Asuka covered his hand with her own. "I never wanted to be a mother. Who would, after a childhood like mine? Back at NERV, every time I had my period, it just felt like my body mocking me… And it's not like I ever thought about living long enough for the future to even mean anything, or that the future was even something I wanted to see. But now I do, because I know I won't be alone. I've always… hated the idea of having to rely on someone else for anything… but it's okay if it's you."

明日香用自己的手覆盖住他的手。"我从未想过要成为母亲。谁会愿意，在我这样的童年之后？在 NERV 时，每次月经来临，我都感觉自己的身体在嘲弄我……而且我从未想过能活到未来有意义的那一天，或者那未来是我想要看到的。但现在我愿意了，因为我知道我不会孤单。我一直……讨厌不得不依赖别人的想法……但如果是你，就没关系。"

It was Shinji's turn for his breath to catch in his throat. He'd seen Asuka with no clothes on dozens of times over the last three months, but never this naked. 'I… she wants to be with me… she wants… us? To… have a child? Oh gods oh gods oh gods… You are not ready for this, Ikari! But… but… her… with me…She hates relying onanyone, but she's alright with it beingme? I love her so much… I want to be this close to her forever… Do it! Do it!' He could feel his eyes starting to prickle. He licked his lips and forced his voice not to shake. "Asuka, will you-"

轮到真嗣感到喉咙发紧了。过去三个月里，他已无数次见过赤裸的明日香，但从未像此刻这般坦诚相对。“我……她想和我在一起……她想要……我们？要……有个孩子？哦，天啊，天啊，天啊……你还没准备好，碇！但是……但是……她……和我……她讨厌依赖任何人，但她愿意依赖我？我如此爱她……我想永远与她如此亲近……去做吧！去做吧！”他能感觉到眼眶开始发热。他舔了舔嘴唇，努力让声音不颤抖：“明日香，你愿意——”

"Stop." Asuka's voice was as cool as her tone was sharp.

"停。" 明日香的声音冷若冰霜，语气却尖锐如刃。

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

"Don't. Don't ask… the question I think you're about to ask. Not now, not like this," she said. Tense, careful control vibrated in every word.

"别问。别问我想你即将要问的问题。现在不行，不能这样。" 她说道，每个字都带着紧张而小心翼翼的控制。

Shinji couldn't keep the confused hurt out of his voice. "But, I… why?"

真嗣的声音里难掩困惑与伤感。“可是，我……为什么？”

Asuka was quiet for a long minute, but her arm around him only held him tighter. "Because… I don't ever want to have the tiny, itching worry, at any time in the who knows how distant future… that you only asked me because of this." Her other hand pressed down on his where it still laid against her belly. "We… the future might be a long time, Shinji. I don't ever want to have doubts like that. So… wait. I'm not… ready."

明日香沉默了许久，但她环绕着他的手臂却将他搂得更紧。“因为……我不想在遥远的未来，任何时候，心中都有那微小而刺痒的担忧……担心你只是因为这件事才向我求婚。”她的另一只手按在他仍放在她腹部的手上。“我们……未来可能会很长，真嗣。我永远不想有这样的疑虑。所以……等等。我还没……准备好。”

His thoughts were whirling in pain. He understood why she'd stopped him. If she wasn't ready, she could only say 'no', which would hurt worse. Even so, it stung deeply to be rebuffed like that. It was better than being rejected, but still… His mind seized on a ray of hope. "Yet?" he asked gently.

他的思绪在痛苦中旋转。他明白了她为何阻止他。如果她还没准备好，她只能说出“不”，那会更伤人。即便如此，被那样拒绝还是深深刺痛了他。这比被拒绝好一些，但依然……他的心中抓住了一线希望。“还……？”他轻声问道。

Asuka's eyes dropped and he thought he faw a faint blush on her face. "…Maybe."

明日香的眼神垂了下来，他觉得她的脸颊上似乎泛起了一抹淡淡的红晕。“……或许吧。”

''Be there for her'. I gave myself good advice.' "Never doubt it, Asuka. At all. I've wanted to ask you… that question since the concert."

''在她身边'。我给自己提了好的建议。''永远不要怀疑，明日香。绝不。自从音乐会以来，我一直想问你……那个问题。''

Her eyes came back to meet his, this time with a surprised, questioning look.

她的目光再次与他对上，这次带着惊讶和询问的神情。

He blushed himself. "Let me put it this way; it's a good thing you kissed me and dragged me off stage that fast, or I might have asked you right there." He closed his eyes. "I told you I can do anything for you. If you need me to wait, then I'll wait. You're worth it. You're worth anything." He felt her shiver in his arms, and opened his eyes again to study her with concern. "Asuka?"

他自己也脸红了。“这么说吧；幸好你那么快吻了我并把我拉下舞台，否则我可能当场就向你求婚了。”他闭上眼睛。“我告诉过你，我可以为你做任何事。如果你需要我等待，那么我会等。你值得我这么做。你值得一切。”他感觉到她在他怀里颤抖，又睁开眼睛关切地注视着她。“明日香？”

She shook her head. "Later. Congratulations, Third, you've managed to make me feel better. You can really take me telling you to stop that easily?"

她摇了摇头。“待会儿再说。恭喜你，老三，你成功让我感觉好多了。我让你停下，你真的就这么轻易地听话了？”

"I wouldn't say 'easily', because I really want to, but I can. But… tomorrow, what do we tell everyone? We can't hide this for long." He laughed weakly. "Our plugsuits don't hide much."

我不会说“轻而易举”，虽然我真的很想这么说，但我能做到。可是……明天，我们该怎么跟大家说呢？这事瞒不了多久。”他无力地笑了笑，“我们的战斗服可遮掩不了多少。”

"Ching and Hikari already know. Ching said Sergeant Bir will probably figure it out by what she won't say about it. Hikari is afraid she won't be able to keep Jock-Stooge from figuring out she's hiding something for very long. We have to say something before everyone figures it out anyway. Tomorrow we'll tell them." Asuka sounded less than enthusiastic about the idea.

青和光已经知道了。青说，伯尔中士很可能会从她对此事避而不谈的态度中察觉出来。光担心自己无法长时间瞒过乔克-斯图奇，不让他发现自己有所隐瞒。我们得在大家自己发现之前说点什么。明天我们就告诉他们。" 明日香对这个主意并不怎么热衷。

"This… doesn't make you happy?" he asked.

"这……不能让你开心吗？"他问道。

She shrugged. "I'm still in shock, mostly. And like I said, I never wanted to be a mother. After our parents… but you are not your father, and I am not my mother. We know what mistakes they made, and we're smart enough not to repeat them. And I swear, if nothing else, this…" She stumbled, but forced the word out. "This child will know she is loved and wanted, and will never, ever doubt it." Strength flowed back in to her voice as she made her vow.

她耸了耸肩。“我多半还在震惊中。就像我说的，我从没想过要当母亲。在我们父母之后……但你不是你父亲，我也不是我母亲。我们知道他们犯了什么错，我们足够聪明，不会重蹈覆辙。我发誓，如果别的什么都不行，这个……”她顿了一下，但还是强迫自己说出了那个词，“这个孩子会知道她是被爱和被渴望的，永远不会，永远不会有丝毫怀疑。”随着她立下誓言，力量重新回到了她的声音中。

Shinji found himself nodding. 'I may be like him, but I am not my father, and I willneverwalk away from my child like he did. Wait…' He blinked. "She?"

真嗣发现自己不由自主地点了点头。'我或许像他，但我不是我父亲，我永远不会像他那样抛弃自己的孩子。等等……'他眨了眨眼。"她？"

Asuka's lips curled in a small, enigmatic smile, the first smile she'd worn in hours. "Call it an educated feeling, from a reliable source. I bet we can have Ching verify in the morning. Maybe after we make the announcement."

明日香的双唇勾起一抹微妙而神秘的微笑，这是她数小时以来的第一个笑容。“就当是一种有根据的直觉吧，来自可靠的消息源。我打赌明天早上我们可以让青来证实。或许在我们宣布之后。”

Announcement. The word had a subtle air of sealing his doom, all of a sudden. "A-asuka? You're feeling better and aren't about to freak out anymore, right?

通告。这个词突然间带着一种封印他命运的微妙气息。“飞鸟？你感觉好些了，不会再失控了吧？”

"I guess so. Why?" 我想是的。怎么了？

"Because I think it's my turn, then." He started to shake. Oh gods, oh gods, oh gods, oh gods…..

"因为我想轮到我了，然后。" 他开始颤抖。哦，天啊，天啊，天啊，天啊……

"Baka." 笨蛋。
art 70 第 70 章

Everyone Knows 众所周知

Urgent pounding on their cabin door snapped Shinji awake. Someone was shouting something in rapid Spanish through the door, and he sounded worried. Asuka gave a sleepy and displeased growl. "Shinji, if you're really willing to kill for me, can you start with that guy?" She tried burrowing her face deeper into the pillow.

急促的敲门声将真嗣从睡梦中惊醒。门外有人用急促的西班牙语大声说着什么，听起来很是焦急。明日香发出了一声困倦而不悦的低吼：“真嗣，如果你真的愿意为我杀人，能不能先从那家伙开始？”她试图将脸更深地埋进枕头里。

Shinji's knowledge of Spanish was minimal, but he could make out 'Secretary-General Jinnai' and 'ahora!' clearly enough. He groaned and mumbled into the back of Asuka's hair, "Asuka, I think we'd better see what this is."

真嗣的西班牙语水平有限，但他能清楚地辨认出“金井秘书长”和“现在！”这两个词。他呻吟着，对着明日香头发的背面低语：“明日香，我觉得我们最好看看这是什么。”

Asuka sat up enough to give the door a glare that should have melted through the metal and fried the messenger on the other side all by itself. "Fine, but this better be good. It's not even five a.m.!"

明日香坐起身来，向门投去一道足以熔穿金属并将门外信使烤焦的怒视。“好吧，但最好是有要紧事。现在连五点都不到！”

Rapid dressing and a short walk brought them to a room just off the ship's bridge, where a rickety 1990's videoconference screen and camera had been set up and plugged into the ship's communication system. There weren't many communication satellites still working in 2020, but for the expeditionary fleet that contained a not inconsiderable share of the UN's deployable combat strength, Jinnai had made sure he'd still be able to talk to them. Talk, or in this case, scream and threaten; Shinji could hear Jinnai's voice ranting loudly before they even made it to the bridge.

匆忙更衣后，他们快步来到紧邻舰桥的一间房内，那里架设着一台摇摇欲坠的 90 年代视频会议屏幕和摄像头，并已接入舰船通讯系统。2020 年仍在运行的通讯卫星寥寥无几，但对于这支集结了联合国可部署战斗力量中相当一部分的远征舰队，金井确保自己仍能与他们保持联系。无论是交谈，还是此刻的咆哮与威胁；真嗣还未踏入舰桥，便已听见金井愤怒的吼声。

"-re the Hell are they? It's not like they wandered off a ship in the middle of the ocean for a damn beer run! I want them in front of me now, captain, or I'll see you-...Ah,finally," he broke off as Shinji and Asuka came in. "I don't like my time being wasted, Sohryu. Next time I call, you and Ikari better be here on time. Captain, you're dismissed. This is not for your ears." The captain and the sailor that had summoned them beat a hasty retreat. Jinnai ran his hand over his hair, where his carefully slicked look had become ruffled.

"-他们到底在哪儿？又不是在茫茫大海上从船里溜出去买啤酒了！我现在就要见到他们，队长，否则我就找你……啊，终于来了，" 他话音未落，真嗣和明日香走了进来。"我不喜欢浪费时间，惣流。下次我召唤，你和碇最好准时出现。队长，你可以走了。这不是你该听的。" 队长和传唤他们的水手匆忙退下。阵内用手捋了捋头发，原本精心打理的发型已显得凌乱。

Shinji could feel Asuka bristle and bite back on angrily pointing out the time was still well short of dawn in their location. None of it showed on her face, although Shinji could see her shoulders tense up. He had to push down the urge to take her hand. They both felt calmer when they did that, but he knew it was probably safer for them both not to give Jinnai any signs that things had changed between them since they'd left Marseille. Shinji didn't need to remind himself to avoid Jinnai's eyes like he used to. The overly intense shine they'd gained since the coup was disturbing enough to remind him all on its own. He stared at Jinnai's uniform instead. It had gained quite a few more medals and ribbons since the coup, along with the general's stars he now wore.

真嗣能感觉到明日香浑身一紧，强忍着指出此时离他们所在地的黎明还早得很。尽管她脸上没有显露，但真嗣能看出她的肩膀绷紧了。他不得不抑制住想要握住她手的冲动。每当他们这样做时，两人都会感到更平静，但他知道，对他们俩来说，不向神乃木透露自离开马赛以来他们之间关系的变化可能更安全。真嗣无需提醒自己要像往常一样避开神乃木的目光。自从政变以来，那目光中过度的炽热已经足够让他不寒而栗。他转而盯着神乃木的制服，自从政变后，上面又多了不少勋章和绶带，还有他现在佩戴的将军星徽。

Shinji's eyes narrowed as he spotted something on Jinnai's shirt and uniform jacket.'That's a lot of little spots. Is that…' His eyes widened back up again. 'Blood.'

真嗣的眼睛眯了起来，因为他注意到阵内衬衫和制服夹克上有东西。那是一大片小斑点。那是……'他的眼睛又睁大了。血。'

For all his complaints about their tardiness, Jinnai just stared at them for a minute. The almost feverish glitter in his eyes was really starting to unsettle Shinji. Then he locked his eyes on Shinji in particular, and Shinji felt his anxiety sharply increase.

尽管金井对他们的迟到抱怨不已，但他只是盯着他们看了一分钟。他眼中那近乎狂热的光芒，着实让真嗣感到不安。随后，他将目光特别锁定在真嗣身上，真嗣感到自己的焦虑急剧上升。

"So, Sohryu, you remember General Weidling?" he began, grinning nastily.

“那么，长空，你还记得魏德林将军吗？”他开始说道，脸上挂着恶毒的笑容。

Helmuth Weidling was the Warden of Germany. He'd been just a name to Shinji, but he supposed Asuka would have met him while she was in Berlin those years. He looked at Asuka out of the corner of his eye, watching her nod. "Yes. What about him?" she asked.

赫尔穆特·魏德林是德国的典狱长。对于真嗣来说，他只是一个名字，但他猜想，几年前在柏林的明日香可能与他有过交集。他用眼角余光观察着明日香，只见她点了点头。“是的，他怎么了？”她问道。

"General Weidling expressed dissatisfaction with my removal and replacement of Winthrop as UN Secretary-General. He expressed these feelings after we caught him trying to move two battalions of the Colonial Parachute Regiment towards Berlin as part of an attempt to 'restore the legitimate UN leadership'. He no longer entertains these notions. My arguments against him were compelling." Jinnai raised a still smoking pistol. "'Ultimo ratio regnum', mm, Sohryu?" His grin was creepy and weasel-like to Shinji's eyes.

魏德林将军对我撤换温斯洛普担任联合国秘书长表示不满。在我们发现他试图将殖民伞兵团两个营调往柏林，企图“恢复合法的联合国领导”后，他表达了这些情绪。他不再持有这些想法。我对他的反驳令人信服。”如月举起一把尚在冒烟的手枪。“'王国的最终手段'，嗯，苏琉？”他的笑容在真嗣看来既诡异又狡猾。

Asuka maintained her expressionless poker-face. "Yes, sir," she said evenly. "And you are telling us this because…"

明日香保持着面无表情的扑克脸。“是的，先生，”她平静地说，“您告诉我们这些是因为……”

"Because there are two more battalions of the Colonial Parachute Regiment embarked with the fleet who's officers have trained under and been largely selected by Weidling, and I'm ordering you two to keep an eye on them. If they make any moves that even look like they're anything less than perfectly loyal to me, you are to deal with them like you dealt with the Executive Guards." Jinnai gave them a cool look. "In light of this possible traitorous conspiracy, I've ordered the fleet to accelerate the landings, damn the fuel cost. They'll be in range of the fighter-bombers within 24 hours. You are to have your Eva ready for immediate action upon landing, to crush any resistance and make sure any suspect units stay in line. I have countermeasures ready if there is any large-scale trouble with the fleet, but they are… more wasteful than a simple demonstration by an Evangelion Unit. I don't want any disloyal elements disrupting this operation, understood? You and he better be ready to fight as soon as you make landfall."

因为舰队中还有两个殖民地伞兵团的营，其军官曾在魏德林手下受训并大多由他选拔，我命令你们俩密切监视他们。一旦他们有任何举动看起来不那么忠诚于我，你们就要像处理执行卫队那样对付他们。" 阵内冷冷地看了他们一眼。"鉴于这种潜在的叛变阴谋，我已下令舰队加速登陆，燃料成本不计。他们将在 24 小时内进入战斗轰炸机的射程。你们要确保你们的 Eva 在登陆后立即做好战斗准备，镇压一切抵抗，确保可疑单位保持秩序。如果舰队出现大规模麻烦，我已准备好应对措施，但那些措施……比 Eva 单位的一次简单示威更为浪费。我不希望任何不忠分子破坏这次行动，明白了吗？你们俩一旦登陆，就得做好立即战斗的准备。"

"Understood, sir. We'll be ready for the fleet's arrival right on schedule. We will do what's needed," Asuka said, cool as ice.

“明白，先生。我们将准时迎接舰队的到来，并做好一切必要准备。”明日香冷静地说道。

Jinnai tilted his head a bit at Asuka's continued non-reaction. "Don't tell me you're getting squeamish now, Sohryu. I know what you and Ikari have been doing."

日向侧头看着明日香依旧无动于衷的样子，说道：“别告诉我你现在开始畏缩了，惣流。我知道你和碇在搞什么名堂。”

'Oh, fuck!' Shinji felt his chest squeeze as he stopped breathing and his eyes went wide. Fortunately, his downcast look and lengthening bangs hid his expression, and let him see Asuka's fist clench and tremble, her knuckles solid white. "What we've been doing, sir?" She and Jinnai might have been discussing the weather for all the emotion Asuka's voice showed.

“哦，该死！”真嗣感到胸口一紧，屏住了呼吸，眼睛瞪得老大。幸好，他低垂的目光和逐渐变长的刘海遮住了他的表情，让他能看见明日香的拳头紧握并颤抖，指关节白得发亮。“我们一直在做什么，先生？”她和阵内讨论的语气平淡得仿佛在谈论天气，丝毫未显露情感。

Jinnai gave her a superior look. "You think I'm blind and stupid, Sohryu? I get regular reports on what is happening in my fleet. I know all about what you and the Third Child have been up to. Your entire ship knows. The crew of your ship doesn't know whether to be impressed by the Third Child's stamina or terrified by your appetite."

阵奈给了她一个高傲的眼神。“你以为我既瞎又蠢吗，苏龙？我定期收到关于舰队动态的报告。我对你和第三适格者所做的一切了如指掌。你们整个船上的人都知道。你的船员们不知道是该对第三适格者的耐力感到钦佩，还是该对你的胃口感到恐惧。”

Shinji kept his knees from buckling by an act of will, and resumed breathing. He kept his face aimed firmly at the deck plating, afraid he'd give in to the urge to start giggling hysterically if he looked Jinnai in the face right now. 'That's not allllll we've been up to! Oh gods oh gods oh gods….'

真嗣凭借意志力稳住膝盖，重新开始呼吸。他始终将脸紧贴着甲板，生怕一看到阵内就会忍不住歇斯底里地笑出声来。“我们可不止干了这些哦！”哦，天啊，天啊，天啊……

Jinnai's mask suddenly cracked and he snarled at her. "You… slut."

阵内的面具突然裂开，他对着她咆哮道：“你……这个贱人。”

"Excuse me, sir?" Asuka's face could have been carved from wax.

"劳驾，先生？" 明日香的脸色苍白如蜡。

His right eye was twitching alarmingly as he pointed an accusing finger at her. "You little bitch. I save you from Winthrop, give you refuge under my protection, and all my loving attention for months, and you just laid there like a dead fish. Then you wouldn't stop whining until I arranged you your own apartment. And as soon as the son of the man who ruined the world shows up, you couldn't wait to jump in his bed? You worthless whore. Is he going to protect you now?" Jinnai sneered.

他的右眼惊恐地抽搐着，用指责的手指指向她。“你这个小贱人。我从温斯洛普手中救了你，在我的庇护下给你安身之所，几个月来给予你全部的关爱，而你却像条死鱼一样躺在那里。直到我为你安排了独立的公寓，你才停止了抱怨。可一旦那个毁灭世界之人的儿子一出现，你就迫不及待地跳上他的床？你这个无用的荡妇。现在他来保护你了吗？”阵内冷笑道。

'I'll kill you… how dare you? How dare you say things like that to her!' Shinji bit the inside of his cheek, fighting to keep his mouth shut. His own fists were clenched and shaking now, too. He glanced towards her. Her fist had a tiny drip of blood seeping down from between her fingers.

我要杀了你……你怎么敢？你怎么敢对她说那样的话！' 真嗣咬着脸颊内侧，努力克制自己不要开口。他自己的拳头也紧握着，颤抖不已。他瞥向她，她的拳头间正渗出一滴微小的血珠。

"I was never interested in you. Either of you. What I did was for my own protection," she said, her voice as blank and cool as her face. "Pilot Ikari and I-"

"我从未对你们俩感兴趣。我所做的一切都是为了自我保护，"她说道，声音和她面容一样空白而冷漠。"碇真嗣和我——"

Jinnai cut her off. "Oh, you're going to repeat that tripe again? Because he was right about you? You were whoring around with someone new, weren't you? Him! Should I tell him what else you did there, so he knows what you are? How would you like that, you stupid bitch?"

金奈打断她：“哦，你又要重复那些废话吗？因为他看穿了你？你又勾搭上了新人，不是吗？就是他！要不要我告诉他你在那儿还干了什么，让他知道你是什么货色？你这蠢婊子，觉得怎么样？”

Asuka just let the threat hang in the air. After a moment, she coolly asked, "Is there anything else, sir?"

明日香任由那威胁悬在空中。片刻后，她冷静地问道：“还有别的事吗，先生？”

Jinnai glared at her like he was trying to will her into responding to his threat. "Fine, be that way, you tramp. I have ways of dealing with disloyal sluts like you! In a couple of months I'll have the Dummy Plug program to run my Eva with perfect loyalty, and you'll be useless to me. Useless to everyone except on your back. Enjoy your practice for your future job as a whore, cunt!" Jinnai gestured off camera, and the screen went black.

阵内怒视着她，仿佛试图以意志迫使她回应他的威胁。“好，随你的便，贱人。我有办法对付你这种不忠的荡妇！再过几个月，我就能用 Dummy Plug 程序完美忠诚地操控我的 Eva，那时你对我来说就毫无用处了。对所有人来说，除了躺下，你别无他用。好好享受为将来妓女生涯做的练习吧，婊子！”阵内向镜头外示意，屏幕随即变黑。

Asuka stared at the blank screen, expressionless. Shinji carefully touched her still shaking fist. Her hand snapped open and they interlaced their fingers. Shinji could feel the warm trickle of blood between their hands.

明日香面无表情地盯着空白的屏幕。真嗣小心翼翼地触碰着她仍在颤抖的拳头。她的手猛地张开，两人的手指交缠在一起。真嗣能感觉到他们手掌间温热的血流。

"Asuka, you can't kill him," he said softly.

“明日香，你不能杀他，”他轻声说道。

She whipped her head around to stare daggers at him. She took a deep breath and opened her mouth to blast him with pure fury. "Third-"

她猛地转过头，目光如刀般刺向他。深吸一口气，张开嘴，准备用满腔怒火向他爆发：“第三-”

"Unless I get to help," he finished before she could start.

"除非我能帮忙，"他抢在她开口前说完。

She gaped at him for a second. A smile, simultaneously vicious and brilliant, burst across her face and sparked a matching one on his. She gave him a quick, hard kiss before schooling her face back into a blank mask. "So the 'entire ship knows', fine. I'm not giving them any answers. Let's get the Hell out of here and back to base. We need to tell everyone about the fleet accelerating their landing."

她愣愣地看了他一秒。随即，一张既狰狞又灿烂的笑容在她脸上绽放，也点燃了他脸上相同的表情。她迅速而用力地吻了他一下，然后将自己的脸重新调整成一副空白的面具。“既然‘全船都知道了’，好吧。我不会给他们任何答案。我们赶紧离开这里，回基地去。得告诉大家舰队正在加速登陆的事。”

She took a step towards the door, but halted. Shinji likewise stopped in confusion. He had barely opened his mouth to ask why when Asuka whirled around on him and pulled him into an embrace so hard he could barely breathe, burying her face in his neck. His arms automatically came up to hold her.

她朝门口迈了一步，却又停了下来。真嗣同样困惑地停下脚步。他刚要开口询问原因，明日香突然转身紧紧抱住他，力道之大让他几乎喘不过气来，她的脸埋在他的颈间。他的手臂本能地抬起，环抱住她。

"Towards then end, he couldn't even get it up," she whispered against his skin. "He's maybe half your size. And he never, ever made me feel anything but awful and disgusting. You don't. Thank you."

"到了后来，他甚至都硬不起来了，"她贴着他的肌肤低语，"他可能只有你一半大小。而且他从未，从未让我有过除了糟糕和恶心之外的感受。你没有。谢谢你。"

Shinji smiled and buried his face in her hair. "I'm with you, Asuka. I may not always know what to say, but you can count on that. I promised you."

真嗣微笑着，将脸埋进她的发丝中。“我和你在一起，明日香。我可能不总是知道该说什么，但这一点你可以相信。我向你承诺过。”

Asuka loosened her grip and pulled back. "Baka. Let's go." She visibly had to fight down a smile before she reached for the door.

明日香松开手，后退一步。“笨蛋，走吧。”她明显在努力抑制着笑意，然后伸手去开门。

"-and I don't know exactly what 'I have countermeasures ready if there is any large-scale trouble with the fleet' means, but if Jinnai was ready to start blasting Berlin apart piece by piece with N2 mines until Winthrop's forces surrendered, like Aoba told us before we launched, I wouldn't be at all surprised if he has a few N2 mines tucked away in the fleet and is ready to use them on the fleet or its landed units if it looks like they're getting ideas about doing unto Jinnai what he did to Winthrop."

“-而且我不太明白‘如果舰队出现大规模麻烦，我已备好应对措施’具体指什么，但如果如我们出发前青叶所言，神无准备用 N2 地雷将柏林一块块炸毁，直到温斯洛普的部队投降，那么他若在舰队中藏了几枚 N2 地雷，一旦发现舰队或其登陆部队有对神无采取以其人之道还治其人之身的念头，便准备动用这些地雷，我一点也不会感到惊讶。”

Sergeant Bir shared a look with Ching at Asuka's summary of Jinnai's speech. The Navy aviator just sighed and said "Called it." Bir turned back to them with a half-smile. "So what's the bad news, ma'am?"

比尔中士与阿苏卡总结阵内演讲时，与阿晶交换了一个眼神。这位海军飞行员只是叹了口气，说道：“我早就料到了。”比尔转回身，半笑着问：“那么，坏消息是什么，女士？”

Asuka snorted. "I wouldn't trust the MP Eva either until we go over it with a fine-tooth comb for other nasty surprises. I don't know what else Jinnai might have had them to do that thing. Anything I missed?" She directed this last to Shinji with a squeeze of his hand.

明日香哼了一声。“在彻底检查以防其他意外之前，我也不会信任那台 MP 初号机。我不知道神奈备还有什么其他手段让那东西做了什么。我有没有漏掉什么？”她边说边握紧了真嗣的手。

"Keep me away from Jinnai if we ever see him again, or I think I'll try to rip his face off," Shinji said softly. He looked up from the battle table's display to find everyone, Asuka included, staring at him. "I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?"

"如果再见到金井，请让我远离他，否则我怕我会忍不住撕了他的脸。" 真嗣轻声说道。他抬头望向战术桌上的显示屏，发现所有人，包括明日香在内，都在盯着他。"抱歉，我刚才说出口了吗？"

"You say the sweetest things, Baka-Shinji," Asuka said with a hint of sarcasm in her voice, though she smiled. "We can accelerate our timetable to handle this, right, Ching?"

"你说的话真甜，笨蛋真嗣，"明日香带着一丝讽刺的语气说道，尽管她笑了。"我们可以加快我们的时间表来处理这件事，对吧，阿静？"

Ching nodded. "We built some padding into the final prep times, so we'd be able to handle this, better to be ready a bit early than just in time. Something always happens, like this. Their speeding up put their arrival off Buenos Aires at about ten a.m. tomorrow, so we just make sure you two and the rest of the strike force are in the air by nine."

青点了点头。“我们在最终准备时间中预留了一些缓冲，以便能够应对这种情况，宁可早做准备，也不要踩点。总会有意外发生，就像这次。他们加速导致预计明天上午十点抵达布宜诺斯艾利斯，所以我们只需确保你俩和突击队其他成员在九点前起飞。”

Asuka and Shinji nodded in unison. The plan was fairly simple: intercept the UN Fleet just off the city as they approached, but before they launched any aircraft off the Nanami or landed any troops. Asuka was more than confident the sudden appearance of Red Whirlwind, Touji's Pride Of Osaka, Kensuke's Yamato, and the entire power-armor suited Scout Platoon under Misato would be more than enough to force the UN Fleet commander into surrendering, hopefully without anyone dying. He and Asuka would loom overhead menacingly while Pride of Osaka and Yamato dropped the Scout Platoon on the deck of the Nanami, the Scouts would storm the bridge, and Misato would cheerfully ask the commander of the fleet to give up before they had to start sinking ships. Being able to literally grab the fleet's jets out of the air and snap their wings off would be rather intimidating. Yamato's plasma cannon being able to blow holes right through some of the smaller ships was a nice back-up, too.

明日香和真嗣同步点头。计划相当简单：在联合国舰队接近城市时，于其发射飞机或登陆部队之前进行拦截。明日香深信，红旋风、东治的大阪骄傲、健介的大和号以及由美里指挥的整个动力装甲侦察排的突然出现，足以迫使联合国舰队指挥官投降，希望无人伤亡。他和明日香将在空中威慑，而大阪骄傲和大和号则将侦察排投放到南波米号甲板上，侦察兵将突袭舰桥，美里则愉快地要求舰队指挥官在不得不开始击沉船只前投降。能够直接从空中抓取舰队的喷气机并折断其机翼，无疑极具威慑力。大和号的等离子炮能穿透小型舰船，也是不错的后援。

"In fact, now that we have a fairly hard time for the UN Fleet's arrival, we know we've got enough time for the proper traditional pre-battle party," Ching continued.

事实上，既然我们已经为联合国舰队的到来做好了相当充分的准备，我们就知道有足够的时间来举办一场恰当的传统战前聚会，”青继续说道。

"Pre-battle party?" Hikari asked. "And it's a tradition? This is a strange army."

"战前聚会？"光问道，"还是传统？这支军队真奇怪。"

Misato laughed. "Sounds good to me! I've done things like that."

美里笑了。“听起来不错！我做过类似的事情。”

"Bet you have, ma'am," Sergeant Bir said with a small smile. "Our plans aim for this to be a bloodless takedown, but the enemy always has the chance to make any plan go sideways. That's why he's called the enemy. Our gear and mecha are already tuned up, our plans are set, and our people are ready. So the best thing is to make sure we're ready to face this rested, relaxed, and with no regrets. We've got a handful of volunteers to stand watch for the day, folks with family back home and such, so everybody else is released for the day. Lieutenants, tell your platoons that the party starts here at eighteen hundred, but beyond that they are to get lost and relax for the day."

"您肯定猜到了，女士，"比尔中士微笑着说，"我们的计划旨在实现无血的制服，但敌人总有办法让任何计划出岔子。这就是为什么我们称他为敌人。我们的装备和机甲已经调试完毕，计划已定，人员也已准备就绪。所以最好的做法是确保我们以休息充足、放松无虑、无怨无悔的状态面对这一切。我们有一群志愿者今天会站岗，他们有家人在家乡等等，所以其他人今天都放假了。中尉们，告诉你们的排，派对将在十八点开始，除此之外，他们今天应该消失去放松。"

The rest of the officers around the table nodded and everyone started to turn for the door.

桌边的其他军官纷纷点头，众人开始转身向门口走去。

Hikari quickly moved to Asuka's side. "Asuka!" she hissed. "Aren't you going to say something?" She darted her eyes at Touji, trailing right behind her, a slightly confused look on his face. "Touji already knows there's something I'm not saying that I'm worried about. I hate making him worry about me."

光迅速移到明日香身边，低声道：“明日香！你难道不打算说点什么吗？”她瞥了一眼紧随其后的东治，他脸上带着些许困惑。“东治已经知道我有件担心的事没说出口。我讨厌让他为我担心。”

Asuka blinked blankly at her for a moment. Shinji shook his head for a second.'Oh, right. That.' Jinnai's rant had actually knocked it out of his thoughts too.

明日香茫然地对她眨了眨眼。真嗣也摇头片刻。哦，对了。那个。'阵内的长篇大论也确实让他一时忘记了这件事。

Asuka looked at him, shrugging slightly. He shrugged right back at her. "I guess so," she said slowly. She looked at the rest of her former NERV co-workers and classmates. Ching had already halted everyone at the door with a wordless gesture to turn around. Everyone was watching them curiously. Asuka cleared her throat and blushed a bit. Shinji could feel his own face matching and exceeding it. "One last announcement, everyone. I'm… we're… Shinji and I are… um… expecting."

明日香看着他，微微耸了耸肩。他也同样对她耸了耸肩。“我想是的，”她缓缓说道。她望向其他曾经的 NERV 同事和同学。青已经用一个无声的手势在门口让所有人停下并转过身来。大家都好奇地注视着他们。明日香清了清嗓子，脸上泛起一丝红晕。真嗣能感觉到自己的脸颊也跟着发热，甚至更甚。“最后宣布一件事，各位。我……我们……真嗣和我……呃……怀孕了。”

Surprised smiles and a few gasps greeted her announcement. Kensuke's mouth dropped open. Sergeant Bir gave Ching a look that said he'd expected this, to which Ching just nodded back with a grin. Misato had a huge grin as she elbowed Kaji.

她的宣布引来了惊讶的微笑和几声吸气。健介的嘴巴张得老大。伯尔中士向青投去一个“我早料到”的眼神，而青则笑着点头回应。美里脸上挂着大大的笑容，用胳膊肘轻推了卡吉一下。

Only Touji seemed to escape the general air of celebration. He looked at them blankly. "Expecting what?" he asked. Hikari groaned and put her hand over her face as Misato started laughing.

唯有冬二似乎逃脱了这普遍的庆祝氛围，他茫然地看着大家，问道：“你们期待什么呢？”光呻吟一声，用手捂住了脸，而美里则开始笑了起来。

### Chapter 37 Out On The Town - In Cantio Veritas

Asuka put one hand to the brim of her sun hat to keep the wind off the River Plate from taking it for a flight. The sultry air of the late spring day was pleasantly moderated by the breeze off the water, making her white dress ripple and billow around her legs. Her long red mane was still a rare sight in the city's slowly growing population, and she'd preened a bit under the admiring and sometimes envious looks. Even Shinji had smiled and stood a little taller when she pointed out their fan club. 'As well he should, to be seen on my arm.'

明日香一手按住遮阳帽的帽檐，以防拉普拉塔河上的风将其卷走。暮春时节的闷热空气被水面上吹来的微风调和得宜人，使她那身白裙在腿边轻舞飞扬。她那头长长的红发在城市逐渐增长，的人群中依旧罕见，她欣然接受着那些赞赏甚至嫉妒的目光。就连真嗣，当她指出他们的粉丝团时，也露出了微笑，站得更挺拔了。他理应如此，与我并肩而行。

She smiled to herself as she leaned against the railing lining the shoreside walk. Ok, so not a few of the envious looks had been aimed at her, for having the famous Shinji Ikari on her arm.'He's even pretty cute when he smiles. I still like his eyes best.' The the extra inches he'd grown since they were separated were more noticeable now that the perpetual stoop and slump to his shoulders had faded away over the last two months. 'And watching him walk away is still fun. Yum. All mine.'

她倚着岸边步道的栏杆，独自微笑。好吧，那些嫉妒的目光不少都投向了她，因为她挽着大名鼎鼎的碇真嗣。他笑起来甚至挺可爱的。我还是最喜欢他的眼睛。'自从他们分开后，他长高的那几英寸现在更加显眼了，因为过去两个月里，他肩膀上那持续的驼背和松弛已经逐渐消失。看着他走开仍然很有趣。真棒。全都是我的。'

A few minutes work with the transport pad had emptied their cabin aboard the fleet of all their belongings. They'd stripped the room clean and left the door unlocked. She'd rather enjoyed the idea of leaving the crew of the ship a mystery to explain to Jinnai if anyone even noticed their vanishing act before tomorrow morning. They'd changed into casual clothes and headed out to wander the streets of Buenos Aires, enjoying the slowly reviving city. Going on what was basically an all-day group date with their friends had felt like just the thing to do to enjoy the last day before the battle against Jinnai's forces would begin.

利用传送平台的几分钟操作，他们已将舰队中自己舱室内的所有物品清空。房间被彻底打扫干净，门也未上锁。她倒挺喜欢这种给船员们留下谜团的想法，如果有人注意到他们明早之前的消失，还得向金奈解释一番。他们换上便装，漫步在布宜诺斯艾利斯街头，享受着这座逐渐复苏的城市。与朋友们进行几乎一整天的集体约会，似乎正是享受大战前最后一天的绝佳方式。

Which left Asuka a couple of hours later on a walkway in the Parque Colón, on the Puerto Madero embankment overlooking the River Plate near the Casa Rosada. The 146-year-old ARA Uruguay bobbed at the dock just in front of her. 'Over a hundred years old, and still floating. That's so far pre-Second Impact it's almost funny. Probably still be here after I'm gone.' She shook her head. "And look at me, philosophizing like my Baka-Shinji."

几小时后，明日香独自漫步在巴勒莫区的哥伦布公园，位于马德罗港河岸，俯瞰着普拉特河，不远处便是玫瑰宫。在她面前，146 岁高龄的 ARA 乌拉圭号静静地停泊在码头。历经百年沧桑，依旧漂浮于水面，这比第二次冲击还要久远，几乎显得有些可笑。或许在我离去之后，它仍将屹立不倒。她摇了摇头，自嘲道：“瞧我，竟像笨蛋真嗣一样开始感慨人生了。”

"Your Baka-Shinji?" Mistao asked, moving closer from where she'd just tossed a couple of coins into the park's fountain. "Finally can say that part out loud?" she asked with a crooked smile.

"你的笨蛋真嗣？"美绍问道，从她刚往公园喷泉里扔了几枚硬币的地方走近。"终于能大声说出那部分了？"她带着歪斜的笑容问道。

Asuka rolled her eyes, but nodded. "He's mine. Wondergirl can blow it out her ass. I'm not giving him up for anything."

明日香翻了个白眼，但还是点了点头。“他是我的。绫波丽想都别想。我绝不会为了任何事放弃他。”

Misato snorted. Over the past few weeks in previous 'girls' nights' that Misato had arranged, she'd managed to get the story out of Asuka, along with the sadder admission that despite how happy the two of them looked, she'd still never actually managed to say those three little words back to him and why.

美里嗤笑一声。在过去几周她安排的几次“女生之夜”中，美里设法从明日香那里套出了整个故事，以及一个更令人心酸的坦白：尽管两人看起来很幸福，明日香却始终未能向他回以那三个小字，以及背后的原因。

"You know, earlier he was talking about seeing how long it would be before they got a university going again. He wants to finish an actual Philosophy degree, and maybe a music degree too." She rolled her eyes again. "Baka's trying to show me up. I'm going to have to get a Master's degree to hold over him, keep things in the proper order."

你知道，他之前还在说，要看看他们多久能重新办起大学。他想完成一个真正的哲学学位，或许还有音乐学位。" 她又翻了个白眼，"那家伙想跟我比高下。看来我得拿个硕士学位来压他一头，保持应有的秩序。"

Misato tilted her head. "So you're thinking of the future, now?"

美里歪了歪头。“那么你现在是在考虑未来了？”

Asuka kept staring out at the ship. "It's on my mind, yeah. Being pregnant has kind of forced me to consider it. And Shinji and I talked last night. He tried to… he almost…" Asuka gripped the railing tightly and focused herself. "He was about to ask me that question before I stopped him."

明日香一直凝视着那艘船。“这事确实在我心头萦绕。怀孕这件事让我不得不去考虑它。还有，我和真嗣昨晚谈过了。他试图……他差点……”明日香紧紧抓住栏杆，集中精神。“他差点就要问我那个问题了，但我阻止了他。”

"'That' question?" Misato asked.

"那个问题？" 碇真嗣问道。

"The kind you usually have the guy kneeling down for. The one Kaji already asked you." She waved at Misato's prominent engagement ring.

"就是你通常看到男人跪地求婚的那种。就是加治已经向你求过的那种。" 她朝美里那显眼的订婚戒指挥了挥手。

Misato's eyebrows went up. "Really? But… why'd you stop him? I'm kind of surprised he hasn't asked you that already, Asuka. You two look closer together than most married couples I can think of."

美里挑起了眉毛。“真的吗？但是……你为什么要阻止他？我有点惊讶他居然还没问你，明日香。你们俩看起来比我想象中的大多数已婚夫妇还要亲密。”

"The future, Misato. The future can be a long time. If… if he and I have one, I don't want to spend even a second of it ever wondering if the only reason he asked me is because he feels guilty he got me knocked up."

未来，美里。未来可能会很长。如果……如果我和他有一个未来，我不想在其中哪怕一秒都在怀疑，他向我求婚只是因为他对我怀孕感到内疚。

"'Knocked up'?" Misato laughed. "Come on, Asuka. Everyone can see Shin-chan practically worships the ground you walk on. He treats you like a princess." Misato turned around to lean her back up against the railing and stare back across the park. "It makes me really happy to see it, how happy you two look together." Misato's smile faded a few notches. "Despite my mess ups. I'm sorry."

"'怀孕了'？" 惣流笑了。"得了吧，明日香。每个人都能看出来，真嗣对你简直是崇拜得五体投地。他把你当公主一样对待。" 惣流转过身，背靠在栏杆上，目光再次投向公园。"看到你们俩在一起那么幸福，我真的很开心。" 惣流的笑容稍稍黯淡了些。"尽管我搞砸了。对不起。"

Asuka looked at her. "Sorry? About what?"

明日香看着她。“对不起？为什么？”

"Sorry I didn't do a better job as… well, 'mom', basically. I was the closest thing you and Shinji had to a mom in most of your lives. I knew your history from when I was your guardian in Germany, and I could see the same sort of loneliness in Shinji when he showed up and learned his father wanted nothing to do with him. I tried to be a mom to both of you while you lived with me, and I know I didn't do nearly as good a job as I wish I could have. I could see something between you two, but all I could ever do was tease you both." Misato's tone was regretful. "So it makes me really happy to see you two together like this. I still think of you both as kind of my kids. Kaji does too, you know. You're like a daughter to him, or his little sister."

抱歉，作为……嗯，“妈妈”，我做得不够好。在你们大部分的人生中，我是你和真嗣最接近母亲的存在。从我在德国担任你的监护人时起，我就了解你的过去，而当真嗣出现并得知他的父亲对他漠不关心时，我也在他身上看到了同样的孤独。你们与我同住期间，我努力想成为你们两人的母亲，但我知道，我做得远不如我所期望的那样好。我能感觉到你们之间的某种联系，但我所能做的，只是偶尔调侃你们。” 美里的话语中带着遗憾，“所以看到你们俩现在这样在一起，我真的很高兴。我仍然把你们俩看作是我的孩子。卡吉也是这么想的，你知道的，你对他来说就像女儿，或是他的小妹妹。”

The reminder that Kaji had never seen her as a possible subject of romance didn't bother Asuka as much as it would have two months ago. Seven weeks of soaking in direct, explicit affection and love from Shinji had fairly well blunted the edge of that bite. And she had to admit that the signs his heart had always belonged to Misato were all too plain in hindsight. She'd just wanted so badly to have one of the few people she knew cared about her really look at her like that.'But now I wake up to that sort of look in Shinji's eyes everyday. I think I can live with that.'

卡吉从未将她视为浪漫对象的提醒，如今已不如两个月前那样困扰明日香。七周以来，从真嗣那里直接而明确地感受到的关爱与爱意，已相当程度地缓和了那份刺痛。她不得不承认，回望过去，他的心始终属于美里，这些迹象再明显不过。她只是如此渴望，渴望那些为数不多真正关心她的人中，能有一个人那样看待她。但现在，我每天醒来都能在真嗣的眼中看到那种目光。我想，我可以接受这样的生活。

"Well,mom, thanks to the shenanigans of the end of the world, I'm now only ten years younger than you. And my real mother is waiting for me back on Avalon. Plus, if I start categorizing you and Kaji as my foster parents, it feels a lot more creepy when I check out his backside and go to bed with my quote-unquote brother," Asuka said tartly. "We don't need to sound quite like American hillbillies so much, thanks."

“哎呀，妈妈，多亏了世界末日的那番胡闹，我现在比你年轻十岁。而且，我真正的母亲还在阿瓦隆等着我呢。再说了，如果我开始把你们和加持归类为我的养父母，那当我盯着加持的背影，和我的所谓‘兄弟’上床时，感觉就更加诡异了。”明日香尖刻地说道，“我们没必要说得那么像美国乡巴佬，谢谢。”

Misato stuck her tongue out at Asuka. "So I'll be your Cool Big Sis instead." Her smile dropped away a second later. "But why did you stop him from asking? You know he loves you like nothing else. I don't see that changing in the future, if you two have made it this far. I really can't think of anything worse than the last few years you've been through."

惣流对明日香吐了吐舌头，“那我就当你的酷姐姐好了。”但她的笑容转瞬即逝，“但你为什么要阻止他开口呢？你知道他爱你胜过一切。我看不出未来会有什么改变，既然你们已经走到了这一步。我真的想不出还有什么比你们过去几年经历的更糟糕的了。”

Asuka's silence and refusal to look her in the face spoke volumes.

明日香的沉默以及拒绝直视她的脸，已经说明了一切。

"Still can't say it to him, huh?" Misato asked more gently.

"还是没法对他说出口吗？" 碇真嗣的语气更加温柔了。

"No." The admission felt like ashes in her mouth.

"不。" 这承认让她嘴里像含了灰烬一样难受。

Misato sighed and looked at the ornate pink face of the Casa Rosada across the park. "I've told you how much losing Kaji just before the end tore me up inside. When I got that message he left on the machine, I spent every day after that hating the eight years we could have had that I threw away because I got scared. You don't have to make the same mistakes I did."

美里叹了口气，望向公园对面那座装饰华丽的粉红色卡萨罗萨达。“我告诉过你，在结束前失去薰对我内心的撕裂有多深。当我听到他在答录机上留下的那条留言后，我日复一日地痛恨那本可以拥有的八年时光，就因为我害怕而白白浪费了。你不必重蹈我的覆辙。”

Asuka kept staring out over the docks. "So I'll make all new ones. I tried to push him away after the coup, but I couldn't let him go. I was still even more afraid of being alone. I even tried pushing him away again last night. He wouldn't go. He told me a few days ago he's figured out the difference in what he was doing before and what he's doing now. He's not making himself into a better guy because I told him to anymore. He's doing it because that's what he wants to be. To be the kind of person I'd want beside me, and to not be his father."

明日香一直凝视着码头。“那我就创造全新的。政变后我试图推开他，却无法放手。我更害怕孤独。昨晚我甚至再次尝试推开他。他不愿离开。几天前他告诉我，他已明白之前所为与现在所做的区别。他不再因为我要求而努力成为更好的人。他这么做是因为那是他想要成为的样子。成为我愿意相伴身边的人，不再像他父亲那样。”

Misato barked a laugh. "Good for him! I don't think anybody'd want to be like Commander Ikari."

美里嗤笑一声：“他倒是有自知之明！我想没人愿意成为像碇司令那样的人。”

"But that's where we are now. He's making himself better, and I'm… I never thought I'd see the day where I thought Shinji Ikari was too good for me. But I want him with me. So I don't care anymore if some part of me thinks I don't deserve him. He's what I want, and I'm going to keep him." Asuka raised her chin defiantly. "And I'm going to deserve it. If he can do it, I can too. I'm supposed to be the genius in this pair."

但这就是我们现在的处境。他在让自己变得更好，而我……我从没想过会有这么一天，我觉得碇真嗣配不上我。但我想要他在我身边。所以，我不在乎内心某个角落是否认为自己不配拥有他。他就是我想要的，我会留住他。"明日香倔强地扬起下巴，"我也会配得上他。如果他能做到，我也能。我本该是这对组合中的天才。"

Misato regarded her onetime ward with a half-smile. "It's good to hear you thinking like that, especially since your little 'joint project'," she gestured at Asuka's middle, "Is going to need both of you." Her smile faded. "It really is good to hear that, Asuka. I let myself get scared by the same sort of feeling, and I pushed Kaji away too. And he felt the same sort of thing, so he let me. It cost us eight years that we could have had together, and almost cost us everything. Well, it did, but now we're here and have a second chance. But now you're only ten years behind, and getting ahead on that front. You're making me feel not so old. Thanks!"

美里带着半笑的神情看着她曾经的被监护人。“听到你这么想真好，尤其是考虑到你们的小‘联合项目’”，她指了指明日香的中部，“这需要你们俩共同努力。”她的笑容消失了。“真的，听到这个很欣慰，明日香。我自己也曾被同样的情感吓到，结果把加持推开了。而他也有同样的感觉，所以他也放开了我。这让我们失去了本可以共度的八年时光，几乎让我们失去了一切。虽然确实如此，但现在我们在这里，有了第二次机会。而你现在只落后了十年，正在这方面迎头赶上。你让我感觉自己没那么老了。谢谢你！”

"You dang kids, what are you talking about? I'm older than both of you combined!" Ching said with a smile as she and Hikari joined them. "By about four hundred years, but whatever."

"你们这些小家伙，在聊什么呢？我比你们两个加起来还老！" 青笑着说道，她和光也加入了他们。"大概早了四百年，不过无所谓了。"

"That just means you're buying next time, old lady," Misato joked back.

"那就意味着下次轮到你请客了，老太太。" 三佐打趣地回应道。

Asuka snorted at them. Her former guardian and her new friend had become almost annoyingly good friends over the last two months, not least because Ching was one of the few people Misato had ever met that could out-drink her, a talent Ching had had ample opportunity to demonstrate on their 'Girls' Nights'. 'Huh, no more drinking for me for seven months, damn it.' She'd really started to enjoy those. Hearing ridiculous stories of Misato and Kaji's courtship had been easier to laugh at now that she had a lover of her own.

明日香对他们嗤之以鼻。过去的监护人和新朋友在过去两个月里变得几乎令人讨厌地亲密，尤其是因为阿静是真嗣遇到过的少数能比她更能喝的人，阿静在她们的“女生之夜”上有充分机会展示了这一才能。哼，接下来的七个月我可不能再喝酒了，该死。她真的开始喜欢那些夜晚了。现在自己也有了恋人，听真嗣和薰的恋爱趣事更容易笑出来了。

"I'm also the only one of us that's even close to single, too, so nyah!" Ching snarked back. "You're engaged, Asuka and Shinji couldn't be separated with a crowbar, and Hikari and Touji are nearly as tight!" Hikari blushed at being called out, but made no move to deny it. Asuka was still pretty sure her friend and Touji hadn't gone as far as she and Shinji, though.

"我也是我们中唯一一个勉强算单身的，哼！" 晶反驳道，"你订婚了，明日香和真嗣用撬棍都分不开，而光和东治也差不多！" 被点名的光脸红了，但没有否认。明日香仍然确信她的朋友和东治还没发展到她和真嗣那种程度。

"Even Kensuke has a crisis of riches now, with two girls after him!" Ching finished.

连谦介现在也陷入了富贵的危机，两个女孩都在追他！青儿说完。

Misato held up a finger. "Oh, what about TJ?"

葛城举起一根手指。“哦，那 TJ 呢？”

Ching laughed. "I just got a desperate plea for help from him over the net. He's being swarmed by an entire boatload of fangirls that just sailed over from Montevideo. He's envying Kensuke only having to deal with a mere two. He may not be single much longer. That leaves me. So I get to look at the beefcake if I want to."

青笑了。“我刚在网上收到他绝望的求助。他正被一整船从蒙得维的亚来的女粉丝围攻。他现在羡慕健介只需要应付两个。他可能很快就不再单身了。那就只剩下我了。所以，如果我想的话，我可以欣赏那些肌肉男。”

"Single, hmm? What about Sergeant Tightpants?" Misato needled her.

"单身，嗯？那特工紧身裤先生呢？" 葛城调侃道。

Asuka gave her friend a look. "Yeah, are you 'with' Bir, or just having fun?"

明日香瞥了朋友一眼，“是啊，你是和比尔‘在一起’，还是只是玩玩而已？”

Ching stared out at the River Plate. "I… I'm not sure, really."

青凝视着拉普拉塔河。“我……我真的不确定。”

"You don't know?" Misato asked, disbelief in her voice.

"你不知道？" 美里问道，声音中带着难以置信。

Asuka laughed at the annoyed look Ching gave Misato. Ching rolled her eyes at Asuka. "Yeah, yeah, now I know how you felt when everyone was asking you that. Very funny." Her expression turned thoughtful. "I've just… never looked at it like that. I've just been cruising along, having fun, but I really… like spending time with him. I don't know." She shook her head. "Well, that's why he arranged this little day off, so we could do whatever we need to do to make sure we go into the fight tomorrow with a clear mind and a ready heart. This is supposed be a night of no regrets, the chance to say and do things just in case it really is the last chance. So…I guess I need to do some thinking…"

明日香看着青对三佐露出的恼怒表情，不禁笑出声来。青对明日香翻了个白眼，“是啊，是啊，现在我算是体会到你当时被大家追问时的感受了。真好笑。”她的神情变得若有所思，“我只是……从未从这个角度考虑过。我一直随心所欲，享受着乐趣，但我真的……喜欢和他共度时光。我不知道。”她摇了摇头，“嗯，这就是他安排这个小假期的目的，让我们能做任何需要做的事情，确保明天投入战斗时心无旁骛，准备就绪。这本应是一个无悔之夜，是说出和做出一切以防万一这真的是最后机会的时刻。所以……我想我需要好好思考一下……”

Misato looked like she wanted to make another joke at her friends expense, but a thoughtful expression spread on her face. "No regrets, huh?" She looked at Asuka. "Hm… guess I can't let you get too far ahead."

美里本想再拿朋友开个玩笑，但脸上却浮现出沉思的表情。“没有遗憾，是吧？”她看向明日香。“嗯……看来我不能让你太超前了。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at her.

明日香朝她挑了挑眉。

Misato shrugged. "I already pushed him away once, and then lost him after I'd just let him back in. I'm not losing him again like that. Not without everything I can hold on to from him."

葛城美里耸了耸肩。“我已经推开过他一次，刚让他回来就又失去了他。我不会再那样失去他了。没有尽我所能抓住他的一切，我是不会放手的。”

"You've already gotten him to ask you to get married what el- …ah." Asuka tapped her stomach lightly. "Right?"

你都已经让他向你求婚了，还想要什么……啊。”明日香轻轻拍了拍自己的肚子，“对吧？

Misato nodded. "He's getting me preggers tonight, or he's going to pass out trying!" Misato thumped her fist into her other hand.

葛城点了点头。“他今晚要不让我怀孕，要不就累到昏过去！”葛城一拳砸在另一只手上。

Hikari turned a little red as Ching started laughing. Asuka smiled and looked across the plaza again. Kaji and Touji were approaching, drinks and snacks in hand. But Asuka only had eyes for the blue-eyed boy bringing up the rear of their little formation. He brightened up and waved as he caught sight of them.

光的脸颊微微泛红，因为青开始笑了起来。明日香微笑着，再次环顾广场。加持和冬二正走过来，手里拿着饮料和小吃。但明日香的目光只停留在队伍后方那个蓝眼睛的男孩身上。他一看到他们，便精神一振，挥手致意。

"No regrets, hm…." She muttered to herself, waving back. 'I'm close to something. I can feel it. I still don't know what it is, but I'm not afraid to find out. Not anymore.'

"没有遗憾，嗯……" 她喃喃自语，挥手回应。我接近了某个东西，我能感觉到。我仍不清楚那是什么，但我不再害怕去发现。不再害怕了。

Part 71 第 71 章

In Cantio Veritas 在歌中寻真

She would admit it, if anyone asked; she was unapologetically wallowing in how good she felt right now. Asuka took another sip of her (non-alcoholic, alas) beer and purred.

如果有人问起，她会坦然承认；她此刻正毫无顾忌地沉浸在那种美妙的感觉中。明日香又抿了一口（可惜是非酒精的）啤酒，心满意足地发出了一声轻哼。

She was lying, quite comfortably, in Shinji's arms, leaning back against his chest. A leaping fire danced in the firepit near them, where a nervous looking Kensuke was making gooey smores for Katya and Kimatra. Asuka watched them for a second and laughed to herself again.

她舒适地躺在真嗣的怀里，背靠着他的胸膛。篝火旁，紧张兮兮的健介正在为卡佳和基马特拉制作黏糊糊的棉花糖夹心饼干。明日香看了他们一会儿，又独自笑了起来。

The two girls were not glaring at each other as they had been the rest of the week. They were now both sitting side by side, watching Kensuke with matching, almost hungry stares. Kensuke had arrived just ahead of the girls, looking like he couldn't decide if he was happy or terrified as he relayed the news that TJ had finally stopped 'helping' and showed him and the girls how to set Kensuke's interface band to auto-translate for them. The girls had 'borrowed' his band, and conducted a rapid conference out of his hearing. When they returned, they told him they'd decided not to fight over him anymore.

那一周里，两位女孩一直怒目相向，如今却并肩而坐，以近乎饥渴的目光齐刷刷地盯着健介。健介比她们早到一步，脸上交织着喜悦与恐惧，他带来消息说，TJ 终于不再“帮忙”，而是教会了他和女孩们如何设置健介的接口带进行自动翻译。女孩们“借用”了他的接口带，避开他进行了一场迅速的商议。回来后，她们告诉他，已决定不再为他争斗。

Asuka laughed harder. The girls had told Kensuke they'd decided to share. He hadn't stopped nervously looking over his shoulder at the two girls, who were suddenly close friends.

明日香笑得更厉害了。女孩们已经告诉健介，她们决定共享。他不停地紧张地回头看那两个突然成为好朋友的女孩。

She wriggled deeper into Shinji's embrace and watched TJ finish setting up the tiny sound box and display he'd produced when Misato had declared their 'Night of No Regrets' would not be complete without substantial amounts of partying, drinking, and karaoke. Specifically, couples' karaoke. They'd drawn straws for the order, gotten drinks, and waited for TJ and Corporal Vasraith to finish the set up. Ching had used the time to corral Sergeant Bir, who had gone amusingly pale when the 'couples' part had been laid out.

她扭动着更深地钻进真嗣的怀抱，看着 TJ 完成那个小巧音响盒和显示屏的设置。这一切始于美里宣布，没有狂欢、畅饮和卡拉 OK 的“无悔之夜”将不完整，尤其是情侣卡拉 OK。他们抽签决定了顺序，取了饮料，等待 TJ 和下士瓦斯雷斯完成布置。趁着这段时间，青用尽办法把比尔中士拉了过来，当提到“情侣”环节时，比尔中士的脸色变得有趣地苍白。

Misato had been devious. Each pair would not be singing a duet, oh no. They'd be singing toeach other. Each partner was supposed to pick a song that 'put their feelings into music', as Misato had proclaimed. Even Kaji had looked a little nervous at that one. Touji and Hikari had gone sheer white and beet red respectively. Shinji, surprisingly, had simply looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded to himself. Asuka actually felt herself looking forward to finding out what he'd come up with. She was still mulling her own choice over.

美里真是狡猾。每对搭档并非要合唱，哦不，他们是互相为对方唱歌。每位搭档都得挑选一首能“将情感化为旋律”的歌曲，正如美里所宣称的那样。连加持都显得有些紧张。东治和光分别变得面色苍白和满脸通红。令人惊讶的是，真嗣只是沉思了片刻，然后对自己点了点头。明日香发现自己竟然期待着看他会选什么歌。她还在斟酌自己的选择。

Kaji took the stage for the first song. Misato, already three beers in, took a seat right in front of him, grinning in anticipation. Slow music with strings began to play, and Kaji started singing in accented but perfect English. "Only you can make this world seem right/ Only you can make the darkness bright/ Only you and you alone/ Can thrill me like you do/ And fill my heart with love for only you..."

卡吉登台演唱第一首歌。美里此时已喝了三瓶啤酒，她坐在他正前方，满怀期待地咧嘴笑着。悠扬的弦乐缓缓响起，卡吉用带着口音却十分标准的英语开始唱道：“只有你能让这世界变得美好/只有你能让黑暗变得光明/只有你，只有你/能像你那样让我心动/用只属于你的爱填满我的心……”

Misato's grin slowly faded as The Platters' 'Only You' played and Kaji's light baritone sang to his fiancée. An almost stunned look took its place. When he finished and stepped forward to hand her the mic, she grabbed his face to haul him in to a torrid kiss before taking the mic and stepping up. Kaji sat down with a dreamy smile.

随着 The Platters 的《Only You》旋律响起，加持那轻柔的男中音对着未婚妻歌唱，惣流脸上的笑容逐渐消失，取而代之的是一种近乎震惊的表情。当他唱完并上前递给她麦克风时，她猛地抓住他的脸，拉近来了一个热烈的吻，随后接过麦克风，走上前去。加持坐下时，脸上带着梦幻般的微笑。

Misato shook herself and pushed a matching look off her face in exchange for a sharper grin and she tapped at the display screen for her choice. A much faster rock beat began to play, and Misato turned her back to them. As the beat hit the moment for her to begin, she spun around to point right at Kaji. "Your love has set my soul on fire, burnin' out of control/ You taught me the ways of desire, now it's takin' its toll…/ You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy…/ The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be…/ You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker,/ Don't you mess around with me!/ You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker,/ Don't you mess around, no, no, no!" Misato seemed to derive a great deal of pleasure from the emphasis she put into Pat Benatar's 'Heartbreaker', especially Kaji being 'the right kind of sinner'.

美里猛地一震，换下脸上的相配表情，换上更为锐利的笑容，轻触显示屏做出选择。一段更快的摇滚节奏响起，美里转过身去。随着节奏到达她开始动作的瞬间，她旋即转身，直指卡吉。“你的爱点燃了我灵魂的火焰，失控地燃烧/你教会了我欲望的方式，现在它正索取代价……/你是那种能释放我内心幻想的罪人……/你是无敌的赢家，你知道你生来如此……/你是心碎者，梦想编织者，爱情掠夺者，/别跟我玩花样！/你是心碎者，梦想编织者，爱情掠夺者，/别跟我玩花样，不，不，不！”美里似乎从她对帕特·贝纳塔的歌曲《心碎者》的强调中获得了极大的乐趣，尤其是卡吉被视为“那种罪人”。

Asuka kept right on wallowing in how good she felt. She was warm, comfortable, content, wrapped in the arms of someone she knew loved her, surrounded by her friends, having a good party at the end of a good day, looking forward to leading a force tomorrow that trusted her to lead with skill and bravery, and do it all piloting a mecha that demanded her rare skills and talent. She was loved, admired, and valued. She felt… different… whole?

明日香继续沉浸在那种美妙的感觉中。她感到温暖、舒适、满足，被一个她知道深爱她的人拥抱着，周围是她的朋友们，在一个美好日子的尾声享受着愉快的派对，期待着明天带领一支信任她以技巧和勇气领导的队伍，并且这一切都是驾驶着一台需要她罕见技能和才华的机甲。她被爱着、钦佩着、珍视着。她感觉……不同……完整？

She blinked at herself. Yes. Whole. For the first time in years, longer, she didn't feel like a pile of broken pieces inside anymore. She no longer had to find reasons not to end it all just to get out of bed in the morning. She no longer feared the future. She felt whole, maybe for the first time in her life since the day she'd opened that door in the hospital and screamed. 'And all because I just asked Shinji that morning if he loved me. That's all it took? All I had to do was reach out to him that much? Or he to me? I wish he could have done that earlier… well, he did reach out to me after Berlin… but I was still so angry with him. He tried in Instrumentality… and I shot him down. Be fair, Sohryu, he did try once in a while. You never believed him. Wait…' Her eyes widened. 'Instrumentality… hedidtry then… but that wasafterhe broke when he saw Unit-02 being… chewed on. And all that other crazy stuff! That… when I was yelling at him on the train! The next thing he did was…' Asuka's eyes were as wide as they could go. Touji was singing some sad Enka piece to Hikari, but Asuka heard nothing but her pulse roaring in her ears.

她凝视着自己。是的，完整无缺。多年以来，甚至更久，她第一次不再感觉内心支离破碎。她不再需要寻找理由以抗拒结束一切的念头，只为清晨能从床上爬起。她不再畏惧未来。她感到完整，或许自她在医院推开那扇门并尖叫的那天起，这是她生命中第一次如此。'而这一切，只因那天早上我问了真嗣是否爱我。仅此而已？我所要做的，只是向他伸出手那么一点？或是他向我伸出手？我多希望他能更早些这么做……好吧，柏林之后他的确向我伸出了援手……但我那时仍对他怒气未消。他在人类补完计划中尝试过……而我拒绝了他。要公平，惣流，他偶尔确实努力过。你从未相信过他。等等……'她的眼睛瞪大了。'人类补完计划……他那时确实尝试了……但那是在他目睹二号机被……撕咬后崩溃之后的事。还有那些疯狂的事情！那……就是我在火车上对他大吼的时候！接下来他所做的……'明日香的眼睛睁得不能再大。东治正为光唱着一首悲伤的演歌，但明日香耳中只有自己脉搏的轰鸣。

'He asked me…'I want to help you somehow and stay with you forever.'Heaskedme!He was already shattered, he'd seen everyone die, especially me! He shouldn't have had anything left!But he asked to help me!That should have been his lowest point, but Baka-Shinji, the spineless jellyfish that helps nobody, reached out to me! And I… I told him 'No.'…that'swhat made him snap. Not everyone else, justme!When he has nothing left at all… he still reaches for me! Not for support, but to make me feel better!. He looks atme!His whole world is me!' He reached out to her, even when he should have had nothing left. "He… loves me," she whispered. Her eyes began to water. 'It's really true! Oh Holy Gott, he… it really is me he wants' She winced. 'And I just... hurt him. Damn it, Sohryu, why couldn't you have said 'yes'? Alright, that's the past. But now that I know, now what? He asked to help me… right after he betrayed me… and I did the same right back…'

他问我……'我想以某种方式帮助你，永远和你在一起。'他居然问我！他早已支离破碎，目睹了所有人，尤其是我的死亡！他本不该剩下任何东西！但他却提出要帮助我！那本应是他的最低谷，但愚蠢的伸二，那个无骨的软弱者，却向我伸出了援手！而我……我告诉他'不'……正是这让他崩溃。不是其他人，只是我！当他一无所有时……他仍然向我伸出手！不是为了寻求支持，而是为了让我感觉更好！他看着我！他的整个世界就是我！'即使他本应一无所有，他还是向她伸出了手。"他……爱我，"她低声说。她的眼睛开始湿润。'这是真的！哦，神圣的上帝，他……他真正想要的是我'她皱眉。'而我只是……伤害了他。该死，苏利宇，你为什么不说'是'呢？好吧，那是过去。但现在我知道了，现在怎么办？他背叛我之后立刻提出要帮助我……而我同样回敬了他……'

She squirmed around in Shinji's arms to face him. Shinji locked eyes with her, a curious look on his face, but he just held her gently, waiting. Asuka opened and closed her mouth a few times, trying to find the right words. She took a deep breath and forced the words out. "I forgive you."

她在真嗣的怀里扭动着，转过身来面对他。真嗣与她四目相交，脸上带着好奇的神情，但他只是温柔地抱着她，静静等待。明日香张了张嘴，又闭上，试图寻找合适的词句。她深吸一口气，终于将话说出口：“我原谅你。”

Shinji blinked. "What?" 真嗣眨了眨眼。“什么？”

"A betrayal for a betrayal. You betrayed me when you left me to fight alone and die… and I betrayed you when you needed me to help you the most, and you were still trying to help me. After all that you'd lost, watching Misato and me die, me yelling at you on that train-place… after all that you still asked to help me and stay with me. And I just told you 'No'. I hurt you and you hurt me, both at the worst possible times… we're even, Shinji. So I forgive you, for not being there at that battle… and I'm sorry for telling you 'No' when you were so low, but still reached out to me. You really are… for me." She dipped her head forward to gently press a kiss to his lips. "My turn."

以背叛还背叛。你背叛了我，留下我孤身奋战直至死亡……而我在你最需要我帮助的时候背叛了你，尽管你仍在努力帮助我。在你失去一切之后，目睹我和美里死去，我在那列车上对你怒吼……经历了这一切，你仍请求帮助我并留在我身边。而我只是对你说了‘不’。我在最糟糕的时刻伤害了你，你也在最糟糕的时刻伤害了我……我们扯平了，真嗣。所以我原谅你，在那场战斗中没有出现……也为你在我如此低落时仍向我伸出援手，我却对你说‘不’而感到抱歉。你对我来说，真的是……”她低下头，轻柔地吻上他的唇。“轮到我了。”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Asuka stood up and smiled. "It's my turn. To sing. Pay attention, Third Child."

明日香站起身，微笑着说：“轮到我了。唱歌。第三适格者，注意听。”

She took the mic from a still blushing Hikari, who practically leapt into Touji's arms as she left the stage. She tapped at the screen for a moment, and brought up a song Misato had played for them at one of their Girls' Nights. Misato said it made her think of her and Kaji, right after they got back together. Asuka hadn't said anything, but it made her think of her and Shinji, too. Now more than ever. She let the music rise, and smiled at Shinji as she began.

她从依旧脸红的光手里接过麦克风，光几乎是跳进了冬二的怀抱，随即离开了舞台。她轻触屏幕片刻，调出了一首歌曲，那是美里曾在她们的女生之夜为她们播放过的。美里说这首歌让她想起了自己和加持刚复合时的情景。明日香虽未言语，但这首歌也让她想起了自己和真嗣。如今，这份感触愈发强烈。她让音乐缓缓升起，微笑着望向真嗣，开始了演唱。

There were those empty threats and hollow lies

那些空洞的威胁和虚伪的谎言

That whenever you'd try to hurt me

I'd just hurt you even worse then so much deeper

But you were history with the slamming of the door

We forgive and forget 我们宽恕并遗忘

And it's all coming back to me now

此刻一切又重回我心间

"One is two are one," she remembered Ching saying… he was with her now and she knew, deep down, that he always would be. 'Forgiving…feels better than I expected,' she thought with mild surprise as the song ended. Shinji was still staring at her, the same stunned look on his face as he'd had when she'd stood up. His hands came up automatically to catch hers as she walked back over to him, and she used the grip to pull him to his feet. "Your turn, Third. Wow me."

"一即是二，二即是一，"她忆起青如此说过……此刻他正与她同在，她深知，他永远都会如此。'原谅……感觉比预想的还要好，'她略感惊讶地想着，此时歌声已落。真嗣依旧凝视着她，脸上仍是她起身时的那副震惊表情。她走回他身边，他本能地伸手握住她的手，她便借力将他拉起。"该你了，第三位。让我惊艳一下。"

Shinji had to blink at her a few times before his brain snapped back into gear. "Um, right! My turn. Singing. Right." He shook himself and stepped up to the player to set his song up. A repeated piano note started it off, with the drums and guitar coming in as Shinji set himself in front of the mic.

真嗣不得不眨了几下眼睛，才回过神来。“呃，对！轮到我了。唱歌。对。”他摇了摇头，走上前去设置自己的歌曲。重复的钢琴音符拉开序幕，随着真嗣站在麦克风前，鼓点和吉他也随之加入。

I'm sorry that I hurt you

对不起，我伤害了你

It's something I must live with everyday

这是我每天必须面对的事情

And all the pain I put you through

以及我让你经历的所有痛苦

I wish that I could take it all away

但愿我能带走这一切

And be the one who catches all your tears

成为那个捕捉你所有泪水的人

Thats why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

I've found a reason to show

A side of me you didn't know

你未曾了解的一面

A reason for all that I do

我行事的缘由

And the reason is you

原因就是你

There was some applause for Shinji's surprisingly good rendition of Hoobastank's 'The Reason'. Asuka eagerly accepted Shinji's return to her side with a nuzzle and a kiss. "Not bad, Third Child. So I'm your reason to do all sort of amazing stuff, huh? Maybe I should ask you to conquer the world for me. I think it might work."

对于真嗣出乎意料地出色演绎 Hoobastank 的《The Reason》，现场响起了掌声。明日香热情地迎接真嗣回到自己身边，用蹭脸和亲吻表达欢迎。“不错嘛，第三适格者。看来我是你做各种了不起事情的理由呢？或许我该让你为我征服世界，我觉得这招可能管用。”

Shinji laughed slightly nervously and rubbed at the back of his head. "Well, I might. That is kind of why we're here, right? And I've got promises to keep now, don't I?" Shinji resumed his position behind her and let her settle against him. "I feel like I can do anything when I'm with you. And even if you forgive me, I still feel like I owe you so much. So even if it takes my life and everything I have, I will be there for you. You are the most important thing in my life." He blinked for a second and placed one of his hands on her stomach. "No. You both are. And it makes me so glad I can say that. Because I know my father couldn't, and it helps me know I'm not him."

真嗣略带紧张地笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。“嗯，我可能有点。这不就是我们来这里的原因吗？而且我现在有了承诺要遵守，不是吗？”真嗣重新站到她身后，让她靠在自己身上。“和你在一起时，我感觉自己无所不能。即使你原谅了我，我仍然觉得欠你很多。所以，哪怕要付出我的生命和我所拥有的一切，我也会在你身边。你是我生命中最重要的人。”他眨了眨眼，将一只手放在她的腹部。“不，你们俩都是。能这么说，我感到非常高兴。因为我知道我父亲做不到，这让我明白我不是他。”

He broke into German: "Ich liebe dich, mein Engel. So lange ich lebe ist mein Herz dein. Alles an mir gehört dir, und immer sein werden."

他突然用德语说道：“我爱你，我的天使。只要我活着，我的心就属于你。我的一切都属于你，并将永远如此。”

Asuka swallowed against tears, suddenly glad that he couldn't see her face right now. She could feel her skin burning red. 'I won't let you ask me that question, so you go and do this anyway? Baka. My baka.' She just pulled his arms tighter around her and said, "Th- ahem! That's good to hear, Shinji. Um… Hey! Sergeant Bir's next! I want to see what he's going to sing for Ching. This ought to be good."

明日香强忍泪水，突然庆幸他此刻看不见她的脸。她感到自己的脸颊发烫。'你非要这么做，不让我问那个问题吗？笨蛋。我的笨蛋。'她只是更紧地拉住他的手臂，说道：“那、咳！听到这个真好，真嗣。嗯…嘿！下一个是比尔中士！我想看看他要为静唱什么。这肯定精彩。”

She could feel his snort into her hair at the obvious dodge. She reddened further as she could tell from it that he'd understood that was as much of a response to his oath as she could handle right now, and accepted it. She couldn't even explain exactly how she knew that so clearly, but that knowledge was certain. 'Mine. Go to Hell, Wondergirl.'

她能感觉到他在她发间轻蔑的哼声，显然是在躲避。她脸更红了，从他的反应中她明白，他已理解这是她目前能对他的誓言做出的最大回应，并接受了这一点。她无法确切解释自己是如何如此清晰地知晓这一切的，但这份认知确凿无疑。'我的。去你的，神奇女孩。'

Sergeant Bir took the stage and threw Misato an amused look as he selected his song. "Ok, Lieutenant Katsuragi, you asked for it. Everyone's been trying to catch us acting like we're more than just an officer and her NCO, and we've been having fun keeping you from catching us. But this is a night of no regrets, and since you've insisted on 'couples' karaoke', here you go. Doc, this one's for you." A twangy guitar and piano beat came on. Bir closed his eyes, and started to sing.

比尔中士走上舞台，选歌时向美里投去一个戏谑的眼神。“好吧，葛城少尉，这可是你自找的。大家一直想抓到我们超越军官与士官关系的把柄，而我们乐在其中，让你抓不到。但今晚无悔，既然你坚持要‘情侣卡拉 OK’，那就来吧。医生，这首歌献给你。”随着一阵吉他与钢琴的弹拨声响起，比尔闭上眼睛，开始唱了起来。

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease

我没有发烧，却得了不治之症

Take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy

开出一剂良方，非医者一人之力

Awful lot of money, but it isn't what I need

钱是不少，但并非我所求

Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me

要清除我体内的这毒，一枪可不够

Hey, I got the symptoms 1,2, and 3

嘿，我出现了症状 1、2 和 3

First you need 首先你需要

Yeah, I need 是的，我需要

Then you bleed 然后你流血

I'm bleeding all over 我浑身是血

On your knees 跪下

Oh baby, please 哦，宝贝，求你了

This boy's addicted and your kiss is the drug

这男孩已沉溺，你的吻便是那毒药

When you find your medicine you take what you can get

当你找到你的药，你会尽你所能获取

If there's something better baby, Lord they haven't found it yet!

宝贝，如果还有更好的，天啊，他们还没找到呢！

Your love is like bad medicine

你的爱如同劣药

Bad medicine is all I need

我所需要的只是劣药

Your love is like bad medicine

你的爱如同劣质药剂

Let's play doctor 我们来玩医生游戏吧

Cure my disease 治愈我的疾病

Sergeant Bir gave Ching a wink at 'let's play doctor', and finished Bon Jovi's 'Bad Medicine' with a half-grin. Ching's face was an unreadable blank as she walked over and took the mic from him. Her non-reaction faded Bir's expression into puzzlement as she took the stage and he sat down. He grabbed his drink and took a sip, watching her closely.

比尔中士对青眨眼示意“我们来玩医生游戏”，并以半笑结束了邦乔维的《坏药》。青接过麦克风走向舞台时，脸上毫无表情，她的无动于衷让比尔的表情转为困惑。他坐下，拿起饮料啜了一口，目光紧盯着她。

Ching didn't even glance at the song selection. She held the mic up in front of her face in both hands and took a deep breath. She locked eyes with Bir. "Dalren? Don't die," she said, perfectly calm. With that, she dropped the mic onto the stage and walked off into the darkness beyond the firelight.

青甚至没有瞥一眼歌曲选择。她双手举着麦克风，放在面前，深吸了一口气。她与比尔对视，“达伦？别死，”她平静地说。说完，她将麦克风扔在舞台上，走进了火光之外的黑暗中。

Bir's face froze and his glass dropped from his hand. Corporal Vasraith spit out his mouthful of vodka into the fire, which obligingly turned it into a fireball that sent Kensuke jumping backwards yelping and swatting at his singed eyebrows. No one else moved.

比尔的脸色凝固，手中的玻璃杯滑落。下士瓦斯雷斯将口中的伏特加喷向火堆，火堆顺势将其化为一颗火球，吓得健介向后跳去，尖叫着拍打自己烧焦的眉毛。其他人则纹丝不动。

Asuka finally managed to close her dropped jaw. "What… what just happened?"

明日香终于合上了她惊讶得张开的下巴。“什么……刚刚发生了什么？”

"Aw come on, ma'am! He's an ape! He's not even a Marine!" the felinoid Marine suddenly protested in the direction Ching had vanished. TJ started laughing. Bir continued his best impression of a statue. Misato and Kaji shared a puzzled look before shrugging at Asuka's question.

"哎呀，女士！他只是个猿猴！他甚至都不是海军陆战队员！" 那个猫科动物般的海军陆战队员突然朝着 Ching 消失的方向抗议道。TJ 开始大笑起来。Bir 继续他那最像雕像的模仿。Misato 和 Kaji 交换了一个困惑的眼神，然后对着 Asuka 的问题耸了耸肩。

TJ finally brought himself under control after laughing for a bit. "That… ha ha ha… that was an amazing example of High Avaloni, ma'am. Wow. And Top didn't even see it coming, looks like."

TJ 终于在笑了一会儿后控制住了自己。“那…哈哈哈…那真是高雅弗洛尼语的一个绝妙例子，女士。哇。而且 Top 似乎完全没有预料到。”

Shinji said, "Um… you're going to have to tell us what that is, TJ."

真嗣说：“呃……TJ，你得告诉我们那是什么。”

Asuka looked at where Ching had gone. "Yeah. Do you people have yet another language we don't know about?"

明日香望向青离去的方向。“是啊。你们这些人是不是还有我们不知道的另一种语言？”

TJ ducked his head. "Sorry about that, ma'am, er, Asuka. Yes, sort of. High Avaloni is an… expansion more than a separate language. It's a way of communicating more information with tones, super- and sub-soincs, psionic sidebars, et cetera, than the straight words convey. Useful for talking over listening ears in some places, but also a good way of packing a ton of meaning into few words, to emphasize what you've said all the more. And boy, did she pack a lot into that!"

TJ 低下头，"抱歉，女士，呃，明日香。算是吧。高雅洛尼语更像是一种扩展而非独立的语言。它通过音调、超音和次音、心灵感应旁白等方式，传达比直白词汇更多的信息。在某些地方，这是避开监听的好方法，同时也是将大量意义浓缩进寥寥数语，从而更加强调你所说内容的有效手段。天哪，她那句话里可真是信息量巨大！"

Misato raised an eyebrow. "So what did she say? I'm guessing 'Dalren' is Sergeant Bir's long-mysterious given name?"

美里挑了挑眉。“那她说了什么？我猜‘达伦’就是比尔中士那神秘已久的名字吧？”

TJ nodded. "You got it. To unpack what she said… um… let me see..." TJ stared at the fire for a moment. "She said 'Dalren, I know we are in a isolated and small unit engaged in a fight with little margin for error, and that both that and Imperial Code of Military Justice regs argue against us starting anything serious under such circumstances, but I am highly impressed by your courage, intelligence, and dedication to the Emperor and our mission, and am very attracted to you. As we should not and cannot engage in a serious or formal relationship until such time as our mission is at least complete and we are hopefully reunited with the Empire, I will not do anything to imperil our task. But please accept my expression of interest in exploring a relationship that will at minimum involve my shagging you until you can't walk straight for weeks, and please do not die in any of the proceeding engagements of our campaign and remain alive until such time comes that we might be free to do so. Goodnight.' That covers the essentials of it, I think."

TJ 点头道：“明白了。来解读一下她的话……呃……让我想想……” TJ 凝视着火堆片刻。“她说：‘达伦，我明白我们身处一个孤立且狭小的单位，正进行着容错率极低的战斗，而且帝国军事法典的规定也反对我们在这种情况下开始任何严肃的关系。但我对你的勇气、智慧以及对皇帝和使命的忠诚深感钦佩，并对你产生了极大的好感。既然我们不应也不能在任务完成前，或在有望与帝国重聚之前发展正式或严肃的关系，我不会做出任何危及我们任务的举动。但请接受我对探索一段关系的兴趣，至少包括与你缠绵至你数周内步履蹒跚，并请在接下来的战役中不要丧生，保持存活，直到我们可以自由地那样做的时候。晚安。’我想这基本概括了她的意思。”

Misato stared at him. "She said all that with three words?"

葛城美里盯着他。“她用三个字就说了这么多？”

"It's a very concise language."

这是一种非常简洁的语言。

Corporal Vasraith finished coughing the remaining vodka out of his nostrils. "Man, that stings! Ow! And sheesh, why couldn't she have had better taste? Saying something like that to an Army puke!"

瓦斯莱思下士终于咳出了鼻腔里残留的伏特加。“天哪，真刺痛！哎哟！还有，她怎么就不能有点品味呢？对一个陆军废物说那种话！”

"Blow it out your ass, Jarhead," Bir said vaguely, his eyes still locked on the mic Ching had dropped. "Um… I… I think… I'd…"

"从你那儿吹走吧，海军陆战队的，"比尔含糊地说，目光仍紧盯着青掉落的麦克风。"呃……我……我想……我……"

"Go after her, maybe?" Asuka supplied, sarcasm seasoning her tone.

"去追她，怎么样？" 明日香提议道，语气中带着讽刺。

"Yeah… um… I'll do that." Bir worked himself upright. "Good Lord, she makes me feel like a damn fumbling teenager again," he muttered, staggering off after her.

"嗯……呃……我会那么做的。" 比尔挣扎着站起来。"天哪，她让我感觉自己又像个笨手笨脚的少年了，"他嘟囔着，踉踉跄跄地跟在她后面。

Asuka gave the older woman a wry look. "'Couples' karaoke', huh, Misato?"

明日香对那位年长女性投去一个苦笑，“‘情侣卡拉 OK’吗，美里？”

Misato gave her an unrepentant grin right back. "Hey, it looks like it got them to do something constructive. If I'd known it would have worked that well, I'd have suggested it weeks ago." She paused as an idea hit her. "Or maybe a few years ago for you two!" She stuck her tongue out at Asuka.

葛城毫不悔改地回以一笑：“嘿，看来这让他们做了些建设性的事。早知道效果这么好，我几周前就该提出来了。”她顿了一下，灵光一闪：“或者对你俩来说，几年前就该提了！”她朝明日香吐了吐舌头。

Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she shifted her gaze to the remaining members of their party. "Well, let's see… Vasraith says his girlfriend is back in the Empire, and TJ's somehow managed to evade that horde of admirers from this afternoon, so that leaves…" She grinned wickedly. "Aida-kun, you're up. This ought to be good."

她的眼睛闪烁着调皮的光芒，目光转向了队伍中剩下的成员。“嗯，让我看看……瓦斯拉斯说他女朋友还在帝国，而 TJ 不知怎么躲过了今天下午那群仰慕者，所以就剩下……”她邪恶地咧嘴一笑。“Aida 君，轮到你了。这肯定精彩。”

The spectacled teen looked over his shoulder at the two young ladies who leaned forward eagerly, waiting for his response. He swallowed heavily. "Um, how about I sing 'Be Careful What You Wish For'?" he said weakly.

戴着眼镜的少年回头望向那两位急切前倾的年轻女士，等待着他的回答。他艰难地咽了口唾沫，声音微弱地说：“呃，我唱一首《小心许愿》怎么样？”

Asuka closed her eyes and relaxed back against Shinji. "'No regrets' feels pretty nice," she murmured to him. His wordless nod of assent spoke volumes to her better than any 'High Avaloni' ever could.

明日香闭上眼睛，放松地靠在真嗣身上。“‘无悔’的感觉真不错，”她对他低语。他无声的点头赞同，对她而言胜过任何“高雅洛尼”的言语。
2OCT20 Author's Note: For those looking, Asuka's song was Celine Dion's 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now'. And since A&T has stalled me for too long, I'm working on the last couple scenes of this, and should have the end in a few days. Yes, that's right, ACoS has a final end in sight, after all these years. A friend in Austria is even helping me ensure Asuka and her mother speak proper North Austrian (German, that is. :V)

02OCT20 作者注：寻找答案的朋友们，明日香所唱的歌曲是席琳·迪翁的《It's All Coming Back To Me Now》。由于 A&T 让我耽搁太久，我正着手完成这部作品的最后几个场景，预计几天内能完结。没错，历经多年，《ACoS》终于即将迎来大结局。我的一位奥地利朋友甚至帮忙确保明日香和她母亲使用的是标准北奥地利德语（即德语，笑）。

### Chapter 38 Taking The Fleet - Confrontation & Ends

Shinji shivered and felt around the bed without opening his eyes. He felt clammy and cold, something he hadn't felt in bed since he and Asuka had really started sleeping together. However, his blindly fumbling hands found no welcome source of warmth to cuddle up to. "Asuka? Wh're you?" he mumbled. "Asuka? Come back…"

真嗣颤抖着，闭眼在床上摸索。他感到湿冷，这种感觉自从他和明日香真正开始同床共枕后就不曾有过。然而，他盲目摸索的手并未找到任何可供依偎的温暖源泉。“明日香？你在哪？”他含糊地嘟囔，“明日香？回来吧……”

Silence and chill. He regretfully slitted his eyes open.

寂静与寒意。他遗憾地眯起眼睛。

He was alone in the bed. And the room was full of fog.

他独自躺在床上，房间里弥漫着雾气。

"Oh." He sat up slowly, the clammy sheets falling off his chest. "Rei?"

“哦。”他缓缓坐起身，湿冷的床单从胸前滑落。“零？”

The slim blunette stepped into view, tiny beads of moisture clinging to her student uniform. Her expression was as blank and cool as ever. "Hello, Ikari." Her eyes narrowed the tiniest fraction as she saw his hand still resting where it had halted, in the spot where Asuka should have been laying. "I do not understand, Pilot Ikari, why you seek comfort and contact from one who professes to hate you nightly."

苗条的蓝发女孩步入视线，学生制服上挂着细小的水珠。她的表情一如既往地空洞而冷漠。“你好，碇。”看到他的手仍停留在本该是明日香躺着的位置，她的眼神微不可察地一紧，“我不明白，碇驾驶员，你为何要从每晚声称憎恨你的人那里寻求安慰和接触。”

Shinji started. "Wha-…Rei! I… Asuka was right, it's you that's blocking us from contact with the Empire, isn't it? Why are you doing this?"

真嗣一惊，“什……绫波！我……明日香说得没错，是你阻止我们与帝国联系的，对吧？你为什么要这么做？”

"I seek only to protect you, Pilot Ikari. That person took you away from this world. I could not see you. I did not want this person to take you away again. And Pilot Sohryu continues to hate you, yet she claims you belong to her. I told her I would protect you from her hatred and vacillation."

我只想保护你，碇真嗣驾驶员。那个人将你从这个世界上带走。我无法见到你。我不希望这个人再次将你带走。而明日香驾驶员依然憎恨你，却声称你是属于她的。我告诉她，我会保护你免受她的憎恨和犹豫不决的伤害。

"I… Asuka doesn't hate me!" Shinji protested.

"我… 明日香并不讨厌我！" 真嗣反驳道。

"She said exactly that yesterday. She tells you that everyday, several times on some days."

她昨天就是这么说的。她每天都这样告诉你，有些日子甚至会重复好几次。

"But that's not what she… Rei, she's forgiven me! She's pregnant, we're pregnant!"

但那不是她……丽，她原谅我了！她怀孕了，我们怀孕了！

"Yet she hates you. I do not understand… Why do you tolerate Pilot Sohryu treating you this way." Rei's brows wrinkled in confusion. "I… I would not treat you so."

然而她却恨你。我不明白……为什么你能容忍碇真嗣这样对待你。绫波丽的眉头因困惑而皱起。“我……我不会这样对你。”

"She doesn't… It's not like that, Rei. She doesn't treat me badly. I make her happy. She makes me happy. She's pregnant, and that scares the Hell out of me, but I want to be with her and protect her more than anything."

她并没有……不是那样的，零。她没有对我不好。我让她开心，她也让我开心。她怀孕了，这让我害怕极了，但我比什么都想和她在一起，保护她。

"I do not recall Pilot Sohryu being desirous or accepting of anyone's protection when I knew her," Rei said coolly.

"我认识的绫波丽从未表现出渴望或接受过任何人的保护，"绫波冷冷地说道。

"Well she does!" Shinji exploded. "She died because I failed her once! Didn't you see what happened to her while we were separated? She spent years being forced to sleep with monsters because I failed her again. Then she got shot… I… it's all my fault, Rei. I can't fail her like that again. And it's different now. She wants me with her and I want to be there. And now she's pregnant… It's not because I think I owe her, Rei. It's because this is what I want. When we're together I feel like I can do anything. I don't want to stop feeling the way she makes me feel. I want to be with her for the rest of my life. I want to be hers."

“她确实如此！”真嗣爆发了。“她死了，是因为我曾辜负了她一次！你没看到我们分开时她经历了什么吗？她被迫与怪物共眠多年，又是因为我再次辜负了她。然后她中枪了……我……这都是我的错，绫波。我不能再那样辜负她了。现在情况不同了。她希望我在她身边，我也想在那里。而且她现在怀孕了……这并不是因为我欠她什么，绫波。而是因为这是我想要的。当我们在一起时，我感觉自己无所不能。我不想停止感受她带给我的感觉。我想与她共度余生。我想成为她的。”

"'Hers'," Rei repeated without inflection. "She says that too. 'You are mine.' Like you are a pet or a belonging." Faint, Rei-ish anger colored her voice now. "You are not 'hers'."

"'她的'，" Rei 重复道，语气毫无起伏。"她也这么说。'你是我的。'好像你是宠物或所有物似的。"此刻，Rei 特有的怒意染上了她的声音。"你不是'她的'。"

"Yes I am!" "是的，我就是！"

Rei's face revealed nothing. "…she is still closed. She does not love you."

零的脸上毫无表情。“……她依然封闭。她并不爱你。”

"That doesn't change how I feel about her. And I am willing to wait. Things are changing, Rei, and she's worth waiting for."

那改变不了我对她的感情。我愿意等待。事情正在变化，零，她值得等待。

"I would not treat you like this." Rei's expression was the faintest mix of confusion and anger. "I will not accept her hurting you. I will protect you from her however I can until she convinces me she will not hurt you."

"我不会这样对待你。" 零的表情中混杂着一丝困惑与愤怒。"我不会接受她伤害你。我会尽我所能保护你，直到她能说服我她不会伤害你。"

Shinji pinched his eyes shut and squeezed his fists tight. "Rei, it's not like that! You're not protecting me or any of us by doing this! Stop it, Rei!"

真嗣紧闭双眼，拳头攥得紧紧的。“绫波，不是那样的！你这样做并不是在保护我或我们中的任何一个！停下来，绫波！”

A delicate hand on his shoulder snapped his eyes open and whipped his head around to meet crystal blue eyes. "Shinji, wake up!" Asuka said urgently, shaking his shoulder.

一只纤细的手搭在他的肩上，让他猛地睁开眼睛，迅速转头迎上一双晶莹的蓝眸。“真嗣，快醒醒！”明日香急切地说道，摇晃着他的肩膀。

"What?" He looked back at the foot of the bed. Rei was nowhere to be seen and the fog was gone.

"什么？" 他回头望向床脚，丽不知所踪，雾气也已消散。

"You were just sitting up and mumbling about… Rei?" Her face hardened. "Wait, did you just have one of her little visits?" Asuka glared at the empty space where he'd been looking. "That bitch…"

"你刚刚坐起来，嘴里嘟囔着……是关于丽吗？" 她的脸色变得严肃。"等等，你是不是又经历了她的一次小拜访？" 明日香瞪着刚才他注视的空无一处。"那个贱人……"

"She… she thinks she's protecting me. From you." Shinji shook his head sadly.

她……她以为自己在保护我。免受你的伤害。” 真嗣悲伤地摇了摇头。

Asuka's eyes narrowed and she growled a few choice insults in German. "I am going to strangle that blue-haired bitch the next time I get my hands on her. 'Protecting' you from me? Pffft. Maybe we hurt each other in the past, but," she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him down to lie beside her again. "Things are different now. My Baka-Shinji." She pecked him on the cheek.

明日香的眼睛眯了起来，她用德语低声咒骂了几句。“下次我抓到那个蓝头发的贱人，我一定要勒死她。‘保护’你免受我的伤害？哼。也许我们过去确实互相伤害过，但，”她双臂环抱住他，再次将他拉到身边躺下。“现在情况不同了。我的笨蛋真嗣。”她在他的脸颊上轻吻了一下。

She raised her arm enough to peer at the time on her interface band. "0337. We've still got some time to sleep. Tell me about whatever it was Wondergirl had to say in the morning. We've got a big day ahead."

她抬起手臂，透过接口带查看时间。"0337。我们还有些时间可以睡。关于神奇女孩早上要说的事，到时候再告诉我。我们明天可是个大日子。"

Shinji made himself relax, soaking in her warmth pressed against his side. "Yeah, a big day."

真嗣让自己放松下来，沉浸在她紧贴身旁的温暖中。“是啊，大日子。”

Holding her, sleep came easier than he'd have thought.

抱着她，他入睡比想象中容易得多。

Asuka's irritation hummed through the mental bridge between them as Red Whirlwind screamed over the River Plate towards the UN Fleet. "I cannot believe that bitch," she grumbled again as Shinji finished his description of the dream-conversation. "If she's been watching us like that, she should know it's not what it sounds like. The constant enthusiastic sex isn't a hint?"

明日香的恼怒通过他们之间的心灵感应桥梁嗡嗡作响，红色旋风号正疾驰过拉普拉塔河口，向联合国舰队驶去。“我真不敢相信那个贱人，”她在真嗣描述完梦境对话后再次抱怨道，“如果她一直在那样监视我们，她应该知道事情并非听起来那样。那持续不断的激情性爱还不够明显吗？”

Shinji shrugged sadly. "You know how she's never been very good with emotions. Even in Instrumentality, I don't think she really understood why I was so affected by some things. She has everyone's souls under her care, but I guess it's just too much for her to really gain understanding from. It's too big. So whatever she may see, all she hears is 'I hate you', and takes it at face value."

真嗣无奈地耸了耸肩。“你知道的，她向来不太擅长处理情感。即便在人类补完计划中，我想她也没真正理解我为何对某些事情如此触动。她掌管着所有人的灵魂，但我想这对她来说实在太过沉重，难以真正从中获得理解。这太庞大了。所以无论她看到什么，她听到的只有‘我恨你’，并照单全收。”

Asuka looked aside in her comm window on his screen. "Well… things change. Maybe… maybe I won't be saying that anymore."

明日香在屏幕上的通讯窗口中侧目而视。“嗯……世事难料。或许……或许我不会再那么说了。”

He could feel the complex mix of embarrassment, affection, and… something else that roiled her thoughts now. 'Fear? She's afraid of saying this?' He looked at her more carefully and let his own curiosity and nervousness bleed into the link. "Asuka?"

他能感受到她此刻思绪中翻涌的复杂情感：尴尬、爱意，还有……别的什么。是恐惧吗？她害怕说出这些？他更加仔细地打量着她，让自己的好奇与紧张通过链接渗透过去。“明日香？”

"I… we… look, if anyone had told me six months ago we'd be together like this and that I'd be fucking pregnant by you, I'd have told them they'd lost their damn minds. And I'd have laughed at the idea of forgiving you. It's not like you hadn't given me plenty of reasons to stay mad at you forever. But now… we're here… and… I don't regret it, alright?" She still couldn't meet his eyes. "I like having you with me. I like not having nightmares every night. I like… having someone hold me that I want to hold me. And I… I think you know why I've been saying that all the time. And… you understood, and were patient. So…" She swallowed. "I… we'll talk tonight. Right before a battle isn't exactly how or where I want to talk about this. Alright?" Her eyes finally met his again.

"我…我们…听着，如果六个月前有人告诉我，我们会像现在这样在一起，而且我还怀了你的孩子，我肯定会说他们疯了。我还会嘲笑原谅你的想法。毕竟，你给了我无数理由让我永远对你生气。但现在…我们在这里…而且…我不后悔，好吗？"她仍然无法直视他的眼睛。"我喜欢你在我身边。我喜欢不再每晚做噩梦。我喜欢…有我想要的人抱着我。而且我…我想你知道我为什么一直这么说。而你…你理解了，并且很耐心。所以…"她咽了咽口水。"我…我们今晚谈吧。在战斗前谈这些，并不是我想要的时间或地点。好吗？"她的目光终于再次与他相遇。

Shinji swallowed himself. Asuka's emotions in the link mirrored his own, eager for what might come next but scared as well. "Um… yeah. Tonight."

真嗣吞咽了一下。在链接中，明日香的情感反映了他自己的，既渴望接下来可能发生的事情，又同样感到害怕。“嗯……对，今晚。”

Asuka calmed a bit at his agreement and nodded. "No one needs to 'protect you' from me. I want to be the one protecting you. You're mine, always. You promised." She raised her chin defiantly as she finished.

听到他的同意，明日香稍微平静了一些，点头道：“没有人需要‘保护你’免受我的伤害。我想成为保护你的那个人。你是我的，永远都是。你承诺过的。”说完，她倔强地扬起了下巴。

He couldn't help but smile warmly back at her. The way she said some things that she was still afraid to actually say out loud… he could hear them. It made him glow inside. He couldn't wait for the day she could finally say them. That day didn't feel very far off anymore. "I did. And I'm very glad I did. As long as we're together, I feel like I don't need an Eva to kick over a mountain. I can't wait for tonight." His grin was far more cocksure than it would have been outside their mecha.

他情不自禁地向她回以温暖的微笑。她说话时那种仍不敢大声说出口的某些话……他都能听见。这让他内心感到温暖。他迫不及待地期待着她能最终说出那些话的那一天。那一天似乎已不再遥远。“我确实这么做了。而且我非常高兴我这么做了。只要我们在一起，我就觉得我不需要伊娃来踢倒一座山。我迫不及待地期待今晚。”他的笑容比在机甲外时更加自信。

Asuka still had a bit of a blush, but snorted at him. "Maybe we should have this conversation in here later. You're doing your 'I'm a badass Pilot' thing again."

明日香脸上还带着些许红晕，却对他嗤之以鼻。“或许我们应该晚点在这里继续这个话题。你又在摆你的‘我是酷炫飞行员’的架子了。”

Shinji grinned wider. "You know you like it," he winked back.

真嗣咧嘴笑得更开了。“你知道你喜欢这个，”他眨眼回应道。

She rolled her eyes at him, but he could feel her amusement and acknowledgement through the bridge. "Well, that's for later. 'Game face on' time. We're coming up on 50 kilometers from the fleet." She activated the unit channel. "Misato, you and the Scouts ready for showtime?"

她对他翻了个白眼，但他能通过桥梁感受到她的愉悦和认可。“好吧，那是后话。现在是‘进入状态’的时候了。我们距离舰队还有 50 公里。”她激活了单位频道。“美里，你和侦察兵准备好上场了吗？”

Misato's face appeared in a new window, hard and professional. She was in her own 'serious duty' mode, a far cry from her usual carefree party-animal attitude. "Two dozen suits and me, ready for the drop. We'll have that ship under control within five minutes of touchdown on deck."

美里严肃而专业的面容出现在新窗口中，与平日里无忧无虑的派对动物形象大相径庭。她已切换到“认真执行任务”模式：“两打装甲服和我，准备空降。我们将在甲板着陆后五分钟内控制住那艘船。”

Shinji always found Misato in 'on-duty' mode a little unsettling to deal with. The contrast with her warm and friendly persona at home had always been a little scary to him, even as he knew it marked just how intensely she focused on a mission and how good at her job she was. His apprehension was only made worse this time by the fact she was personally leading the Scout platoon into the fight. He and Asuka had objected to the idea when Misato casually included it in the planning sessions, very much against the idea of their former guardian risking herself as the point of the spear. She had relentlessly argued them down: she was the only one of the former NERV members with personal ground combat experience and she refused to send her platoon into battle from safety. Surprisingly, Kaji had backed her. At their stunned expressions, he'd shrugged and said Misato was a braver and more cunning fighter than any of them, and he knew his fiancée better than to try opposing her on this. Besides, he'd pointed out, it wasn't like there was much chance of any UN sailor's small-arms fire getting through the shields and armor of the Heinlein Mk 161 infantry combat suit she'd be wearing.

真嗣总觉得处于“执勤”状态的美里有些难以应对，她在家时温暖友好的形象与此时形成鲜明对比，令他心生畏惧，尽管他明白这正体现了美里对任务的专注及其工作能力之强。这次，由于美里亲自率领侦察排投入战斗，真嗣的忧虑更甚。他和明日香在规划会议上对美里轻描淡写地提及此事表示反对，坚决不同意这位前监护人将自己置于锋芒之上。然而，美里毫不留情地驳倒了他们的意见：她是前 NERV 成员中唯一拥有地面实战经验的人，绝不会从安全之地派遣自己的排去战斗。令人意外的是，加持也支持她。面对他们震惊的表情，加持耸肩表示，美里比他们任何人都更勇敢、机智，他深知自己的未婚妻，不会在这件事上与她对抗。况且，他指出，联合国水兵的轻武器火力几乎不可能穿透美里将穿着的海因莱因 Mk 161 步兵战斗服的护盾和装甲。

As a result, Misato was riding on the outside of Kensuke's Yamato, magnetically anchored to the skin of the giant Black Knight mecha with the rest of the Scouts. Kensuke would land on the deck of the Nanami, Misato and the Scouts would storm the ship's bridge, and Misato would cheerfully force the fleet commander's surrender at gunpoint. That was the plan, at least. Shinji fervently hoped it would be that simple, but still had to hold his own worries back.

因此，美里正骑在健介的大和号外部，与侦察兵们一同被磁力固定在巨型黑色骑士机甲的外壳上。健介将降落在七海号的甲板上，美里和侦察兵们将冲入舰桥，而美里则会愉快地用手枪迫使舰队指挥官投降。至少计划是这样的。真嗣热切希望一切能如此简单，但内心仍抑制着自己的担忧。

Asuka just nodded sharply. She tapped a key. Touji and Kensuke's faces appeared in their own windows from their mecha, and Ching's from the command pit back at base. "We're at the 50 kilometer mark. All units ready for action. I'm about to drop the cloak."

明日香只是用力地点了点头。她敲击了一个按键，东治和健介的面孔便从各自的机甲中出现在各自的窗口里，而青的则来自基地指挥所。“我们已到达 50 公里标记处，所有单位准备就绪。我即将解除隐形。”

Misato's grin was much less friendly than usual. "The fleet's going to have a nice long couple of minutes to appreciate just how screwed they are."

葛城美里的笑容比平时少了几分友善。“舰队将有足够长的时间来体会他们处境的绝望。”

Asuka just flicked an eye at her display and deactivated the stealth systems covering the three mecha. Optical and electronic concealment fell away, and aboard the UN ships radar displays suddenly lit up with the out-of-nowhere appearance of three enormous radar returns.

明日香只是瞥了一眼显示屏，便关闭了覆盖三台机甲的隐形系统。光学和电子伪装随之解除，联合国舰船上的雷达屏幕上突然亮起，显示出三个凭空出现的巨大雷达回波。

Radar targeting threat alarms buzzed in Red Whirlwind's cockpit. The UN fleet had them locked-on. Two months of experience in the StarStrider kept Shinji from flinching as missiles arced their way up from the fleet's escorts and dove for them. Over a dozen missiles in the first salvo exploded harmlessly against the shields of each mecha. Asuka sneered as a second and third volleys met with the same fate. They wanted to give the UN fleet plenty of time to get a good look at what they were facing.

雷达锁定威胁警报在红旋风的驾驶舱内嗡嗡作响。联合国舰队已经将他们锁定。在星际行者号上两个月的经验让真嗣面对从舰队护卫舰上腾空而起、向他们俯冲而来的导弹时，并未退缩。首轮发射的十多枚导弹在每台机甲的护盾上无害地爆炸。当第二轮和第三轮齐射遭遇同样命运时，明日香轻蔑地笑了。他们要让联合国舰队有足够的时间好好看看他们所面对的是什么。

Shinji tightened his grip on the joysticks to keep his hands from clenching. Some of the fleet's air cover was heading their way. The two elderly AV-8B Harrier IIs on air patrol had finally managed to sweep around and come to bear on the giant flying mecha. The pilots' hesitation and how to even accomplish anything against the titanic machines was evident as they approached. They settled for launching a salvo of missiles backed up by a strafing run from their 25mm cannons. They did no better than their shipboard cousins.

真嗣紧握操纵杆，以防双手紧握。舰队的一些空中掩护正朝他们飞来。负责空中巡逻的两架老式 AV-8B 鹞式 II 型战机终于设法绕过并瞄准了巨型飞行机甲。飞行员们的犹豫以及如何对抗这些庞然大物显而易见，他们接近时选择了发射一波导弹，辅以 25 毫米机炮的扫射。他们的表现并不比舰上的同伴好。

Shinji was surprised when Touji decided to show off a bit as one of the Harriers flew close on its strafing run. An inertial control beam lanced out from Pride of Osaka, slowing the aircraft to a near crawl. Touji reached up and gently closed his mecha's hand around the fighter, plucking it right out of the air. "Hey, look what I caught!" his triumphant cry rang across the net. "I can't believe that worked!"

当东治决定在一名哈利尔战机进行扫射飞行时炫耀一番，真嗣感到惊讶。一道惯性控制光束从“大阪之傲”射出，使飞机减速至近乎停滞。东治伸手轻轻合拢机甲的手掌，将战斗机从空中摘下。“嘿，看我抓到了什么！”他胜利的呼声在网络上回荡。“真不敢相信这招奏效了！”

"Good job, Stooge. Now you're stuck holding it until we can secure a place for you to put it down," Asuka drily observed. Touji cursed in frustration for a moment before he exclaimed "Hey, I think the pilot's trying to surrender! He's got his hands up and he's waving a lot!"

"干得好，斯图奇。现在你得一直拿着它，直到我们找到地方让你放下。" 明日香干巴巴地评论道。东治一时恼火地咒骂了一声，随后惊呼："嘿，我觉得驾驶员想投降！他举着手，还不停地挥动！"

"You can put him in a giant death robot, but he's still a Stooge. Dummy," Asuka muttered. They were almost on top of the small carrier at the center of the fleet. Glowing lines of close-in machine gun tracer fire and a few more missiles from the carrier's own weapons pattered uselessly at their shields. "Geek-Stooge! You're on! Get those Scouts on the deck!"

"你可以把他放进巨型死亡机器人里，但他依旧是个笨蛋。傻瓜，"明日香低声抱怨。他们几乎已经逼近舰队中心的小型航母。来自近防机枪的曳光弹线条和航母自身武器发射的几枚导弹徒劳地敲打在他们的护盾上。"书呆子笨蛋！该你了！把那些侦察机弄到甲板上去！"

"Roger, commander!" Kensuke barked. The young man had taken to his role as a real mecha pilot with alarming enthusiasm. Watching his adopted 'too cool and military for school' persona melt into confusion under the attentions of Katya and Kimatra had been one of the biggest sources of amusement for Shinji and Asuka over the last week. But right now Kensuke was back in his happy element, and he nipped Yamato forward and down to land right in the middle of Nanami's flight deck with precision that even Ching appreciated. Misato led the Scouts in a rapid assault on the few stunned sailors on deck, none of whom seemed inclined to offer the slightest resistance. Their caution might have been affected by the way Kensuke delicately swung Yamato's enormous rifle-plasma cannon around to point at them. The two-meter-wide barrel seemed to fix their attention rather thoroughly.

"罗杰，指挥官！" 健介大声喊道。这位年轻人以惊人的热情投入到了真正的机甲驾驶员角色中。过去一周里，看着他那副在学校里显得过于酷炫和军事化的伪装，在卡佳和基马特拉的关照下变得手足无措，成了真嗣和明日香最大的乐趣来源。但现在，健介又回到了他最擅长的领域，他精准地操纵着大和号向前俯冲，稳稳降落在七海号的飞行甲板中央，连青木都不得不佩服。美里带领着侦察兵们迅速对甲板上少数惊呆的水手发起攻击，这些人似乎都没有丝毫抵抗的意愿。他们的小心谨慎可能受到了健介轻巧地转动大和号那巨型步枪——等离子炮的影响，那两米宽的炮口似乎彻底吸引了他们的注意力。

All the on-deck crew were quickly corralled, and Misato led the majority of the Scouts into the ship's island. Shinji's quick mental command put Misato's helmet camera view up on their screen as Asuka guided them into a position looming over the fleet menacingly. A few low-power shots from Red Whirlwind's lesser weapon systems destroyed or disabled the launchers still firing at them.

甲板上的所有船员迅速被集中起来，而葛城美里则带领大部分侦察兵进入了舰岛。真嗣迅速下达心理指令，将葛城头盔摄像头的画面投射到屏幕上，与此同时，明日香引导他们占据了一个威胁性地俯瞰舰队的位置。红旋风号的次级武器系统发射了几发低功率炮火，摧毁或瘫痪了仍在向他们开火的那些发射器。

They saw a section of Scouts peel off her force at Misato's terse command and head down to seize the ship's Combat Information Center as Misato led the rest of the force upwards to the bridge. Anyone in their path received a quick zap from their stunners. Shinji tried to control his speeding pulse; Misato was taking the very point, leading the way. His struggle got easier as he felt a reassuring squeeze across the link from Asuka.

他们看到一队侦察兵在碇源堂的简短命令下脱离队伍，前往夺取舰船的战斗信息中心，而碇源堂则带领其余人马向上直奔舰桥。任何挡路者都会被他们的电击枪迅速击晕。真嗣试图控制自己加速的心跳；碇源堂正身先士卒，引领着队伍。随着从明日香那里通过链接传来的一阵令人安心的紧握，他的挣扎变得容易了些。

Misato's view finally reached the armored hatch to the bridge, that someone had had the presence of mind to slam shut and lock before they reached. Misato didn't let it slow them down. She motioned two of the Scouts forward to swiftly cut around the entire hatch frame with plasma-edged blades that made short work of the steel bulkhead. A few moments of cutting and a good shove, and the entire hatch and frame toppled inward with a thunderous clang.

碇真嗣的视线最终落在了通往舰桥的装甲舱门上，有人在他们到达之前及时将其猛地关闭并锁死。但这并未让碇真嗣放慢脚步。她示意两名侦察兵上前，迅速用等离子刃围绕整个舱门框架切割，这种刃具轻易地切开了钢制舱壁。经过片刻的切割和用力一推，整个舱门连同框架轰然倒塌，发出震耳欲聋的巨响。

"Look at me, I'm Darth Vader," Misato muttered as she stepped onto the bridge. A few sailors had guns drawn and pointed at her, but their trembling grips and nervous sweat signaled their resistance might not be very firm. Misato aimed the featureless visor of her helmet at the nearest. "Well, go ahead and shoot, you chicken, before I come over there and make you eat that thing," she challenged him in English.

"看看我，我是达斯·维达，" 三佐低声说着，踏上了舰桥。几个水兵已经拔枪对准了她，但他们颤抖的手和紧张的汗水表明他们的抵抗可能并不坚定。三佐将头盔上毫无特征的面罩对准最近的一个。"来吧，开枪啊，胆小鬼，趁我还没过去让你把那玩意儿吃下去，" 她用英语挑衅道。

The sailor she'd singled out jumped and shook for another second before taking a firmer grip on his pistol and squeezing the trigger. The dull buzz of the bullet sparking against her suit's shields was drowned out by the echoes of the shot. Misato didn't even rock back. She slowly turned her visor to the other armed sailors. "Anyone else want to try?" she asked evenly.

被她盯上的水手又跳又抖了一秒，才更紧地握住手枪，扣动了扳机。子弹撞击她护盾的沉闷嗡鸣声被枪声的回音淹没。碇真嗣纹丝未动。她缓缓将面罩转向其他武装水手，平静地问道：“还有人想试试吗？”

The UN sailors looked at the flattened bullet on the deck at Misato's feet, looked at the Scouts aiming their weapons through the cut hole in the bulkhead, and looked back at her. One by one, they dropped their weapons and raised their hands.

联合国水兵们看着碇真嗣脚边被压扁的子弹，又看向从舱壁破洞中瞄准他们的侦察兵，然后再次望向她。一个接一个，他们放下了武器，举起了双手。

"Good boys," Misato said. She turned to the ship's captain, who was sitting very still in the chair at the center of the bridge. "Captain Andrea Borghese, who is in command here?"

"好孩子们，" 葛城说。她转向船长，后者正静静地坐在舰桥中央的椅子上。"安德烈亚·博尔盖塞船长，这里谁是指挥官？"

The grey-haired captain, chosen by Jinnai more for his political reliability and pre-Impact familiarity with the ex-Cavour than his courage, jerked as Misato addressed him by name. "Er… you are, ma'am?" he asked hesitantly.

被金奈选中担任船长的灰发男子，更多是基于其政治可靠性以及对前卡沃尔号的熟悉程度，而非勇气。当葛城直呼其名时，他猛地一惊，迟疑地问道：“呃……您是哪位，女士？”

"Ah, excellent! Smart boys, too!" Misato said, her tone moving a little closer to her usual cheerful ones. "Since we're all in agreement on that, how about you surrender the rest of this fleet before I have my friends," She waved at the hovering mecha. "Start stomping them under the waves?"

啊，太好了！聪明的孩子们，也是！" 三佐说，她的语气稍微接近了平时那种欢快的调调。"既然我们在这点上达成了一致，不如你们在我这些朋友"，她朝悬浮的机甲挥了挥手，"开始把他们踩进海浪之前，交出剩下的舰队如何？"

A drop of sweat trickled down Captain Borghese's temple, betraying an otherwise decent poker face. "Ma'am… our families are in Berlin. Under the Secretary-General's care."

一滴汗水顺着博尔盖塞船长的太阳穴流下，暴露了他原本不错的扑克脸。“女士……我们的家人在柏林。在秘书长阁下的照料下。”

'And Jinnai is just the kind of guy to have told them what might happen to their families if they surrender. Wonderful,' Shinji thought.

而金井正是那种会告诉他们，如果投降他们的家人可能会遭遇什么的人。'真嗣心想，'真是太棒了。

"Oh don't worry. You're not surrendering because I've taken this bridge with a handful of soldiers. You're surrendering after a heroic, if brief, battle against overwhelming force that you had no chance to win. If we'd wanted you dead, we'd have just stood off ten kilometers and done this…" Misato keyed her comms. "Lieutenant Aida, demonstration, 1500 meters ahead, please."

哦，别担心。你并非因为我在少数士兵的协助下夺取了这座桥而投降。你是经过了一场英勇却短暂的战斗，面对压倒性的力量，你毫无胜算后才选择投降。如果我们想要你的命，我们大可站在十公里外，像这样……” 碇真嗣打开了通讯器，“相田剑介中尉，请在前方 1500 米处进行演示。”

"Roger, Lieutenant Katsuragi!" On the deck, Yamato raised its rifle and fired a blinding silver-white blast of plasma at a point on the ocean's surface 1500 meters ahead of the Nanami. A gigantic explosion erupted from the water, throwing a plume of superheated steam and water vapor hundreds of meters into the air. A moment later, all the ships of the fleet rocked and bobbed as the blast wave reached them.

"Roger, Lieutenant Katsuragi！"甲板上，大和号举起枪械，向着南波号前方 1500 米的海面发射了一道炫目的银白色等离子光束。海面上随即发生了一场巨大的爆炸，激起数百米高的过热蒸汽与水雾。片刻之后，冲击波席卷而至，舰队中的所有船只都随之摇摆起伏。

Misato turned back to the captain. She cleared the faceplate of her helmet and gave him a winning smile. "See? You're beaten, we're just making it less messy. We'll be showing Secretary-General Jinnai a much more battered fleet via some video trickery, too, so don't worry on that end. We're not going to let him blame you for surrendering too easily. The only thing you've got that could even scratch our paint is the Evangelion Unit, and there's no way you could use that against us."

美里转头面向舰长，她清了清头盔面罩，向他露出了一个胜利的微笑。“看到了吧？你已经输了，我们只是让事情不那么混乱。我们还会通过一些视频技巧向秘书长神谷展示一个更加破败的舰队，所以你不用担心那边。我们不会让他因为你们投降得太容易而责怪你。你们唯一能对我们造成一点损伤的只有那台 EVA，但你们绝不可能用它来对付我们。”

Captain Borghese's wide-eyed stare finally tore away from staring at where the plasma blast had struck. He blinked in surprise to see the smiling woman revealed by the now transparent helmet. "Ah… why not?"

博尔盖塞船长那瞪大的眼睛终于从等离子爆炸击中的地方移开。他惊讶地眨了眨眼，看到透明头盔下露出笑容的女人。“啊……为什么不呢？”

Misato jerked her thumb at the hovering Red Whirlwind. "I bet you've been wondering where the Hell Pilots Ikari and Sohryu have been this morning. They turned up missing from their cabin, yes? Well, who do you think is piloting Big Red there?" She grinned. "Now, how about you signal the fleet to surrender and follow us in to port, hm?"

葛城指着悬浮的红色旋风，说道：“我敢打赌，你们一定在纳闷，今天早上伊卡里和苏琉的飞行员到底去了哪里。他们从船舱里消失了，对吧？那么，你们猜是谁在驾驶那边的红色巨人呢？”她咧嘴一笑，“现在，不如你们向舰队发出投降信号，跟随我们进港，如何？”

Captain Borghese stared at Misato in confusion, and slowly nodded.

博尔盖塞船长困惑地盯着碇真嗣，缓缓地点了点头。

High above in Red Whirlwind, Asuka nodded in satisfaction. "And that is that. So, what's for lunch, Baka-Shinji?"

在高空中的红色旋风里，明日香满意地点了点头。“就这样了。那么，笨蛋真嗣，午餐吃什么？”

Part 74 第 74 章

Confrontation & Consequence

对抗与后果

"That was easier than I thought it'd be," Touji said, joining them at the foot of Red Whirlwind. Getting all three of their mecha into the confines of the Monumental Stadium along with Eva Unit-01 was a bit of a squeeze, but Asuka and Shinji had decided to keep all their machines in one place rather than disperse them to the airport or other landing sites. Support platoon servicing crews were already swinging into action, giving the mecha a post-mission check over. "I didn't even have to fire a shot."

"比我想象的要容易多了，" 东治说着，来到红色旋风脚下与他们汇合。将他们三人的机甲连同初号机一起塞进纪念碑体育场的空间确实有些挤，但明日香和真嗣决定将所有机器集中一处，而非分散到机场或其他着陆点。支援排的维修班已经开始行动，对机甲进行任务后的检查。"我甚至一枪都没开。"

"The best way," Shinji nodded, a serious look on his face. "Nobody dies."

"最好的办法，" 真嗣点头道，脸上带着严肃的表情。"没有人会死。"

Asuka poked him gently in the head. "Look more cheerful, Baka-Shinji. We just took out Jinnai's entire available strike force and captured the only other Evangelion Unit on the planet. We've managed to pull off this entire operation so far with less than one hundred deaths, despite being a desperate improvisation run on a shoestring. We have been Gottdamn amazing, and you should show it."

明日香轻轻地戳了戳他的头。“开心点，笨蛋真嗣。我们刚刚消灭了金井的全部可用突击力量，还捕获了地球上唯一另一台福音战士。尽管这次行动是临时拼凑，资金紧张，但我们到目前为止只牺牲了不到一百人，已经做得非常出色了。我们简直是太棒了，你应该表现出来。”

"Yes, Ikari-kun, you should," Hikari added cheerfully, appearing from one of the tunnels leading under the stands. She threw her arms around Touji and gave him a kiss on the cheek, causing him to blush and look away. "There's so few cases needing serious attention at the hospital I could even come down here and meet my conquering hero, back from his latest mission."

"是的，碇君，你应该这么做，"光笑着从通往看台下方的隧道中出现。她张开双臂拥抱了冬二，并在他脸颊上亲了一下，让他脸红并转过头去。"医院里需要特别关注的病例很少，我甚至可以下来这里，迎接我那刚完成最新任务的征服英雄归来。"

"Hikari..." Toujui whined in embarrassment. He still wrapped his arms around her too and hugged her back. "I'm just backing up Shinji, and it wasn't exactly the battle of Okinawa out there."

"光..." 透辉尴尬地嘟囔着。他也依旧环抱着她，回以拥抱。"我只是支持一下真嗣，又不是在打冲绳战役。"

Hikari smiled cutely at him. "Hush. It's more fun to call you that than 'my little pony', right? Or should I go with that instead?"

光微笑着可爱地看着他。“嘘，这样叫你比叫‘我的小马驹’更有趣，对吧？还是说，我应该改用那个称呼呢？”

Touji turned bright red and looked wildly around. "Hikari!"

冬二满脸通红，慌张地四处张望。“光！”

Asuka shook her head at the couple's cutesy antics, but then blinked. She darted a sharper look at Hikari. "You're not joking this time, are you?"

明日香对那对情侣的可爱举动摇了摇头，但随即眨了眨眼。她用更锐利的目光看向光。“这次你不是在开玩笑，对吧？”

Hikari turned her head towards Asuka, a grin on her lips that would have done credit to a cat that had eaten multiple canaries. "No~pe! And I was right, he is." She winked and then dissolved into giggles as Touji hid his face in her hair. "I feel great!"

光将头转向明日香，嘴角勾起一抹足以媲美偷吃了好几只金丝雀的猫儿的得意笑容。“不~对！而且我猜对了，他就是。”她眨了眨眼，随后在冬二将脸埋进她发间时，忍不住咯咯笑了起来。“我感觉棒极了！”

Shinji looked back and forth between the two young women, putting the pieces together. He looked at Touji, who was still as red as Asuka's mecha.

真嗣来回打量着两位年轻女性，逐渐拼凑出真相。他看向东治，后者依旧面红耳赤，如同明日香的机甲一般。

"Oh gods..." Touji moaned.

"哦，天哪……" 东治呻吟道。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Congratulations, I guess, Hikari. Stooge, you ever make her cry and I'll throw you into the ocean from here with Red Whirlwind." She gave Hikari a light glare. "You did use protection, I hope? The last thing we need is two of us pregnant"

明日香翻了个白眼。“恭喜了，我猜，光。跟班，你要是敢让她哭，我就用红旋风把你从这儿扔海里去。”她轻蔑地瞥了光一眼。“你用了保护措施的吧？我们可不需要再来两个怀孕的。”

That set off fresh giggling from Hikari. "Yes, 'mother'," she finally managed. She raised her left arm and tapped the underside of her upper arm. "Contraceptive nano-implant. No pregnancies or periods until I turn it off. I got it from Ching yesterday. Your, um, 'occasion' made me think about it. Ching agreed it was a good idea."

这番话又引得光一阵咯咯笑。“是的，‘妈妈’，”她好不容易才说出话来。她抬起左臂，轻敲了一下上臂内侧。“避孕纳米植入物。在我关闭它之前，不会有怀孕或月经。我昨天从晶那里得到的。你，呃，‘那件事’让我考虑到了这个。晶也认为这是个好主意。”

"I did," the Naval officer acknowledged, joining the party. "I figured her parents might be a little surprised if their daughter returned from this expedition with a bump. It would seem kind of sudden to them. As far as they know their daughter just got a boyfriend."

"我确实这么做了，"海军军官承认道，加入了聚会。"我猜她父母如果看到女儿这次远征回来肚子大了，可能会有些惊讶。对他们来说，这似乎太突然了。据他们所知，女儿才刚交了男朋友。"

Asuka pressed her lips together. Their parents... something she'd tried to avoid thinking about over the last two months. She hated to darken the victorious mood, but Hikari had brought it forcibly to her thoughts. "Ching, what about my mother? By the estimate Daniel gave us, she should have woken up weeks ago. I wanted to be there for her when she did." She felt Shinji take her hand, sensing her tension. She gripped back hard, trying to draw strength from the clasp. "He promised I would be."

明日香紧抿双唇，他们的父母……这是她过去两个月来一直试图避免去想的事情。她不愿破坏这胜利的气氛，但光却强行将这个问题带入了她的思绪。“阿诚，我妈妈怎么样了？按照丹尼尔给我们的估计，她几周前就应该醒来了。我本想在她醒来时陪在她身边。”她感觉到真嗣握住了她的手，察觉到她的紧张。她用力回握，试图从这紧握中汲取力量。“他承诺过我会陪在她身边的。”

"If he promised you, then it will be so," Ching said confidently. "He may bring her forward in time whenever we return so she doesn't have to wait for you, or take you back to just before she wakes, or some other way. However they make it happen, the Lord and Lady will keep their promises to you, don't worry. You will get to see her wake, and," Ching nodded at Shinji, "Tell her about your beau, too." Ching grinned. "I wonder how she'll take you telling her she's going to be a grandmother, though. Might make her feel old."

"如果他答应了你，那就一定会实现，"青自信地说道，"他可能会在我们返回时将她提前带到未来，这样她就不必等你了，或者带你回到她醒来前不久，或者用其他方式。无论他们如何实现，主人和女士都会遵守对你的承诺，不用担心。你会看到她醒来，而且，"青向真嗣点头，"也告诉她关于你心上人的事。"青咧嘴一笑，"我好奇她听到自己即将成为祖母的消息会作何反应，可能会让她觉得自己老了。"

Asuka looked at Shinji, squeezing his hand back. He smiled at her. "Yeah, I guess it might... We'll have a lot to talk about."

明日香看着真嗣，回握他的手。他向她微笑。“是啊，我想可能会有很多...我们有很多话要说。”

A chill ran down her spine. 'A lot? I was less than fifteen the last time we were together at all, in the batle at the world after the end... everything I did to survive... What's Mama going to think of me?' Asuka fought down the urge to wrap herself around Shinji and bury her face in his shoulder. She could feel Shinji looking at her. She could tell he knew she was upset about something but didn't want to show it. He just held her hand and let her know he was there with her. She knew all this with utter certainty and without a single word. 'He accepts all of my sins. Will Mama?'

一阵寒意沿着她的脊背袭来。'很多吗？上次我们在一起时，我还不满十五岁，在世界末日后的战场上……为了生存我所做的一切……妈妈会怎么看我？'明日香强忍着想要紧紧抱住真嗣，将脸埋在他肩头的冲动。她能感觉到真嗣正注视着她。她知道他察觉到她有些不快，却不想表露出来。他只是握着她的手，让她知道他就在她身边。这一切，她都确信无疑，无需一言。'他接纳了我所有的罪孽。妈妈呢？'

She crushed the pulse of fear down. Mama had been utterly focused on seeing her in that video clip Jinnai had showed them, and while she knew that was only part of her mother's soul, it was certainly a big part. She knew Mama loved her. She would understand that her daughter had done what she had in order to survive. And she could rely on Shinji to be there with her and support her no matter what. That was a novel, strangely comforting thought. 'Or not so strange, Sohryu. You've known that for a while, haven't you? You just used to hate the idea that you might ever need to. Or worse, want to.'

她将恐惧的脉动压下。妈妈完全专注于在金井展示的视频片段中看到她，尽管她知道那只是母亲灵魂的一部分，但无疑是一个很大的部分。她知道妈妈爱她。她会理解女儿所做的一切都是为了生存。而且她可以依靠真嗣无论发生什么都会在那里支持她。这是一个新奇而令人安心的想法。'或许并不奇怪，苏里宇。你早就知道这一点了，不是吗？你只是曾经讨厌那种可能需要，甚至渴望的想法。'

She shook her head. Baka-Shinji's standing by her was something she could rely on. Fine. For now they had a would-be world dictator to confront. "All the equipment and relays ready for our little show?" she asked Ching.

她摇了摇头。八咔真嗣站在她身边，是她可以依靠的。好吧。眼下他们要面对的是一个潜在的世界独裁者。“我们这场小表演的所有设备和继电器都准备好了吗？”她问青。

Ching nodded. "Lieutenants Aida and O'Brien say we're good to go. We're set with fake visuals of all the damage the fleet took if we need to fool them. O'Brien will be on hand to make sure its all set when we make the call from the Nanami. Aida will be on patrol overhead in Yamato. According to Captain Borghese, they're due to report in within the hour on the status of their landings. Ready to hop over to the ship?"

青点了点头。"艾达中尉和奥布赖恩中尉说我们准备就绪。如果我们需要欺骗他们，我们已经准备好了舰队受损的假象。奥布赖恩会在场确保一切就绪，当我们从 Nanami 号发出信号时。艾达将在上方的大和号上巡逻。根据博尔盖塞船长的说法，他们将在一小时内报告登陆情况。准备好跳转到船上了吗？"

They'd parked the UN fleet twenty kilometers out from Buenos Aires, cautious of the possible threat of hidden N2 mines that Jinnai had hinted at. It would be a short flight to the Nanami by locally assembled aircraft: an Argentinian Army Ch-47 Chinook refitted with Avaloni antigrav engines. Faster than a helicopter, silent, and most importantly, easier to park on a carrier's deck than their mecha. Asuka glanced at Shinji, who nodded at her. "Yeah, let's get this over with."

他们将联合国舰队停泊在布宜诺斯艾利斯外二十公里处，谨慎提防着阵内可能暗示的隐藏 N2 地雷威胁。乘坐当地组装的飞机前往七海将是一段短途飞行：一架阿根廷陆军改装的 CH-47 支奴干直升机，搭载了阿瓦隆反重力引擎。它比直升机更快、更静音，最重要的是，比他们的机甲更容易停放在航母甲板上。明日香瞥了一眼真嗣，后者向她点头示意。“好，我们赶紧把这事办完。”

Captain Borghese nervously eyed the armored woman hovering off to the side of his conference room video-conference rig. "I am... not sure this will work. The Secretary-General is certain to have other spies amongst the ships of the fleet. If he does not know about your giant robots, he will soon."

博尔盖塞船长紧张地瞥了一眼会议室视频会议设备旁悬浮着的装甲女子。“我……不确定这能行。秘书长肯定在舰队其他船只中安插了其他间谍。如果他还不知道你的巨型机器人，他很快就会知道了。”

Misato shrugged. "Just play your part, Captain. If and when he does signal that he's aware your fleet has surrendered, we'll step in and take it from there. We'll make it clear you're operating under duress, don't worry." She tapped her slung rifle for emphasis.

碇司令耸了耸肩，“就按你的角色行事吧，舰长。如果他真的发出了信号，表明他知道你的舰队已经投降，我们会介入并接手。我们会明确表示你是被迫行动的，不用担心。”她为了强调，轻敲了一下挂在肩上的步枪。

The conference room below the Nanami's bridge was cramped enough to begin with, made tighter by all the Imperials and NERV crew standing behind the camera or off to the sides out of view. Captain Borghese was all by himself in front of the camera, looking like a pig facing a panel of wolves. "As you say, ma'am." He adjusted his collar. "I just wish to state my belief that that moment will probably come quickly. The Secretary-General is... a very cautious man about having multiple agents in any organization, and very aware of... possible counter-revolutionary efforts by sympathizers of the previous regime." The Italian accent to his English was thickening under stress.

南波桥下的会议室原本就狭小，再加上帝国军人和 NERV 成员站在摄像机后或视线之外的两侧，空间更显局促。博尔盖塞船长独自面对镜头，宛如一头面对狼群的猪。“如您所说，女士。”他调整了一下衣领，“我只是想表达我的看法，那一刻可能很快就会到来。秘书长对于在任何组织中安插多名特工非常谨慎，并且对前政权同情者可能发起的反革命行动高度警觉。”他的英语因紧张而带上了浓重的意大利口音。

Misato began to run a hand through her hair, halting just before her still-gauntleted fingers made contact. She'd retracted the helmet and neck guards to make her easy to see for the video call, but was still fully geared up otherwise, She lowered her arm and frowned at the UN Commander. "Then your worries will be brief. Now start the call, Captain."

美里开始伸手梳理头发，却在即将触碰到时停了下来。她为了视频通话时方便对方看清自己，已经收起了头盔和颈甲，但其他装备依旧穿戴齐全。她放下手臂，对着联合国指挥官皱了皱眉：“那你的担忧很快就会结束。现在开始通话吧，上尉。”

He nodded acknowledgement of the instruction and pressed the last few keys to activate the video-conference gear. The satellite link with Berlin established itself and stabilized in less time than Asuka would have thought, given how ramshackle the remaining satellite network was at this point.

他点头表示已收到指令，随即按下最后几个键启动视频会议设备。与柏林的卫星连接迅速建立并稳定下来，速度之快超出了飞鸟的预期，毕竟此时残存的卫星网络已显得破败不堪。

Jinnai's unsmiling visage immediately filled the screen. Asuka's grip on Shinji's hand tightened. Years of living and working with Jinnai and the intense pressures of surviving in the paranoid, murderous milieu of Winthrop's UN command had made her very good at reading Jinnai's expressions. Judging by the tiny twitches around his eyes, his current supercilious look of disdain was thinly overlaid on a very, very tense man. "Report, Captain," was all he said, his voice disturbingly flat.

金井那张不苟言笑的面孔立刻占据了屏幕。明日香握着真嗣的手紧了紧。多年来与金井共同生活和工作，以及在温斯洛普联合国指挥下那种偏执、充满杀机的环境中求生的高压，让她非常擅长解读金井的表情。从他眼周微小的抽搐判断，他此刻那副傲慢不屑的神情之下，掩盖着一个极度紧张的人。“报告，上尉，”他只说了这么一句，声音异常平淡，令人不安。

Captain Borghese could read Jinnai too, and looked even more uncomfortable than before. "Good morning, mister Secretary-General. The fleet has reached Buenos Aires and we have made contact with the new rulers of the city. They have recently wiped out the warlords our initial intelligence reported as ruling the city, and-"

博尔盖塞船长也能读懂金奈的心思，看起来比之前更加不安。“早上好，秘书长先生。舰队已抵达布宜诺斯艾利斯，并与该市的新统治者取得了联系。他们最近消灭了我们最初情报中提到的统治该市的军阀，并且——”

"Explain your surrender."

解释你的投降。

Captain Borghese froze. Jinnai's voice had chilled further. "Ah... sir, we... ah... encountered unexpectedly strong opposition..."

博尔盖塞船长愣住了。神无的声音更加冰冷：“啊……先生，我们……啊……遭遇了意料之外的强烈抵抗……”

"You had command of the most powerful fleet this world has seen since the Third Impact. Explain why my spies are telling me you managed a total of less than fifteen minutes resistance, to what they describe as 'giant, flying red and silver Evangelions', and why my Evangelion Pilots are missing." Jinnai's left eye was beginning to twitch alarmingly. "Explain quickly, Captain."

你曾指挥着自第三次冲击以来世界上最强大的舰队。解释一下，为什么我的间谍告诉我，你们对那些所谓的“巨型红银色飞行使徒”只抵抗了不到十五分钟，以及为什么我的使徒驾驶员失踪了。”阵内的左眼开始令人不安地抽搐。“快解释，上尉。”

Captain Borghese looked at Misato. She sighed and hoisted her rifle to point at his head before stepping into the camera's view. "He surrendered because I stormed his ship and put a gun to his head. And he surrendered the fleet because they had no possible means of resistance to our forces and we could have sunk the entire fleet in minutes." Misato nudged Captain Borghese with her rifle and shepherded him off camera. She turned back to stare at Jinnai. "Well, well, well, if it isn't Katsuhiko Jinnai. I remember you, mister Junior Vice-President of Isshinshima Heavy Industries. You've oozed your way up in the world since we met, I see."

博尔盖塞船长望向三佐，她叹了口气，举起枪对准他的头，然后步入摄像机视野。“他投降是因为我冲上他的船，用枪顶着他的头。而他交出舰队，是因为他们对我们毫无抵抗之力，我们本可以在几分钟内将整个舰队击沉。”三佐用枪轻推博尔盖塞船长，将他带离镜头。她转头凝视着神奈，“哎呀，这不是神奈胜彦吗。我记得你，一新岛重工业的年轻副总裁先生。看来自我们上次见面后，你已经混得风生水起了。”

Jinnai's eyes narrowed as he took in Misato's clearly not familiar armor and rifle. His eyes searched her face with no sign of recognition. "Who the Hell are you?"

神乃眼睛微眯，打量着明显陌生的三佐的装甲和步枪。他的目光在她脸上搜寻，却毫无认出的迹象。“你他妈是谁？”

"You tried to sell us an overpriced second-rate knock-off of the Positron Canon we were developing ourselves. Then you grabbed my ass and tried to ask me out for drinks. I might have almost broken your wrist. I know I gave you one Hell of a black eye."

你试图向我们推销一款价格虚高、质量二流的仿制品，而那正是我们自己研发的正电子加农炮。接着你还摸了我的屁股，并试图约我出去喝酒。我差点折断了你的手腕。我确实让你吃了一记重重的黑眼圈。

Jinnai looked puzzled for a moment, then exclaimed, "Wait, Captain Katsuragi?! Wh- ...how the fuck are you..." He clamped his mouth shut and visibly took control of himself before starting again. "So, is this what the rest of NERV has been up to since Third Impact? Building more Evangelions and taking over South America? Fine. I am Secretary-General of the United Nations, and as a UN Special Agency, you and NERV are still under my command. You will release my fleet and submit yourselves and all Evangelions under your control to legitimate UN authority."

神无一时显得困惑，随即惊呼：“等等，葛城舰长？！你……你怎么会在这里……”他猛地闭上嘴，明显在努力控制自己，然后重新开口：“那么，这就是第三次冲击后 NERV 的所作所为吗？制造更多的 EVA，掌控南美洲？好吧。我是联合国秘书长，作为联合国特别机构，你和 NERV 仍受我指挥。你必须释放我的舰队，并将你们自己和所有受控的 EVA 置于合法的联合国权威之下。”

Misato laughed. "'Legitimate UN authority'? That's rich coming from a man who just staged a coup against the last dictator to claim that mantle. You've been Secretary-General by force of arms for a grand total of, what, three months? And said authority is entirely based on your threatening to N2 mine anyone who disagreed with you? I don't think so, Katsy-Watsy. You're about as legitimate as UN Secretary-General as I am as Empress of all China."

美里笑了起来。“‘合法的联合国权威’？这话从一个刚刚发动政变推翻前任独裁者来夺取这一地位的人口中说出来，真是讽刺。你靠武力当上秘书长才多久，三个月？而且你的权威完全建立在你威胁要用 N2 炸弹对付任何反对你的人之上？我看未必，小胜。你这个联合国秘书长的合法性，跟我当全中国的女皇一样不靠谱。”

Jinnai looked annoyed. "You're awfully well informed on supposed events in Europe for someone twelve thousand kilometers away. My position is entirely proper. Who's been telling you filthy lies all the way down in South America?"

金井看起来很恼火。“对于一个远在万里之外的人来说，你对欧洲所谓的动态了解得未免太清楚了。我的立场完全恰当。到底是谁一直在南美洲给你灌输这些肮脏的谎言？”

"Our commanders are fully aware of just how you got your position, mister 'Secretary-General', and how many people you backstabbed to get there. They saw it themselves." Misato smiled at him. "You might say that you owe them your victory."

我们的指挥官们非常清楚你是如何得到这个位置的，'秘书长先生'，以及你为了达到目的背叛了多少人。他们亲眼所见。" 碇真嗣对他微笑道，"你或许可以说，你的胜利是欠他们的。

"The forces that removed the corrupt dictator Winthrop owe their victory to the people who sided with legitimate restoration of UN leadership under my guidance and the original Evangelion Pilots that you should have known. The fleet reported them missing before you attacked. What have you done with them?"

推翻腐败独裁者温索普的力量，其胜利归功于那些在我指引下支持联合国合法领导权恢复的人们，以及你本应知晓的原版福音战士驾驶员。在你发起攻击前，舰队已报告他们失踪。你把他们怎么了？

"Done? The only thing I've done with them today is follow their orders. Why don't you ask them yourselves?" Misato grinned at Asuka as she waved her forward.

"完了？我今天唯一做的事就是听从他们的命令。你怎么不自己去问问他们？" 明日香一边说着，一边笑着向阿苏卡挥手示意她上前。

Jinnai's face went white with rage as she stepped into view. "Sohryu. You traitorous little slut. So you and that little shit Ikari have been plotting behind my back the entire time? I expected something like this. You think just because you're an Evangelion Pilot and you killed one UN leader, you and that spineless idiot can do it again? I'm smarter than you, bitch!"

当她步入视野时，日奈的脸因愤怒而变得苍白。“索龙，你这个背信弃义的小贱人。原来你和那个小混蛋碇一直在背后算计我？我早有预感。你以为自己是使徒驾驶员，杀了一个联合国领导人，你和那个软骨头就能再次得逞？我比你聪明，贱人！”

"Shut it," Asuka said in a cool, clipped tone. She deeply enjoyed the look of apoplexy that Jinnai wore at that. It had probably been years since anyone had talked back to him that way. "We know you've probably planted N2 mines on the ships you thought might be 'disloyal'." And irritated flicker in Jinnai's expression told her that her guess had been right. "We're disarming them as we speak. And we know you've got no other real ability to strike at us here. This expedition was your available deployable strength. So all you're doing now is making noise."

"闭嘴，"飞鸟以一种冷静而干脆的语气说道。她很享受神无脸上那种中风般的表情。可能已经有很多年没有人那样反驳过他了。"我们知道你很可能在你认为可能'不忠'的船上安装了 N2 地雷。"神无表情中闪过的一丝恼怒告诉她，她的猜测是正确的。"我们正在拆除它们。而且我们知道你在这里没有其他真正的攻击能力。这次远征是你可部署的力量。所以你现在所做的只是制造噪音。"

"You think you're so clever? I said I was smarter than you, Sohryu. I plan for everything. I planned the entire operation that removed Winthrop right under his nose. I'm not about to be outsmarted by a useless cunt like you or your pathetic bed toy, no matter what sort of forces you and NERV have put together over there."

你以为自己很聪明吗？我说过我比你更聪明，飞鸟。我为一切做好了计划。我策划了整个行动，就在温斯洛的眼皮底下把他除掉了。我绝不会被你这种无用的废物或你那可怜的床上玩物所智胜，无论你和 NERV 在那边集结了什么样的力量。

"Oh, I think you're going to be surprised," Asuka said with a thin smile. "You have no idea what we're bringing."

"哦，我想你会大吃一惊的，"明日香带着一丝微笑说道，"你根本不知道我们带来了什么。"

"You're the one going to be surprised, bitch. You think I've been idle while you and that cowardly shit have been playing 'Love Boat'? I planned for disloyalty in the fleet, and for what to do if they tried to be rebels. I even planned for clever little shits like you finding and disarming the N2 mines. I've got dozens of N2 mines retrofitted onto old Russian ICBMs now. They'll be turning Buenos Aires and everything around it into a molten crater in thirty minutes. That is, if anything survives after I activate the remote self-destruct I had them build into you Evangelion's S2 engine! Say goodbye, you disloyal whore!" Jinnai nearly screeched. He turned to the side of the camera on his end. "MAGI! Activate the self-destruct in Evangelion Unit Fifteen! Authorization Red-Four-Alpha! Execute!"

你才是要大吃一惊的那个，贱人。你以为我和那个懦夫玩“爱情船”时，我就闲着吗？我早料到舰队中会有不忠之徒，也计划好了如何应对他们的叛变。就连你们这些小聪明找到并拆除 N2 地雷的情况，我也考虑到了。现在，我已经将数十枚 N2 地雷改装到了老式俄罗斯洲际导弹上。不出三十分钟，它们就会把布宜诺斯艾利斯及其周边变成一个熔岩坑。当然，前提是你的使徒引擎在我启动内置的自毁遥控装置后还能幸存！永别了，你这不忠的婊子！”如奈几乎尖叫着说道。他转向自己这边的摄像头一侧，“MAGI！启动第十五使徒的自毁程序！授权码红四阿尔法！执行！”

"Authorization verified and acknowledged. Command sent... command sent... Unit Fifteen acknowledges receipt of command. Activating self-destruct. Cycle will complete in forty-three seconds," replied the neutral, hollow voice of the Berlin MAGI.

"授权已验证并确认。命令已发送...命令已发送...十五号单位确认收到命令。启动自毁程序。将在四十三秒内完成循环。"柏林 MAGI 那中性而空洞的声音回应道。

Jinnai turned back to Asuka with a wild, fevered grin. "Say your prayers, Sohryu. Enjoy getting raped by demons in Hell. Bye bye now." The screen went black.

金井转头面向明日香，露出了狂热而狰狞的笑容。“祈祷吧，惣流。好好享受在地狱被恶魔蹂躏的滋味。再见啦。”屏幕随即变黑。

"Scheiße..." Asuka whispered in shock. She bolted towards the door and the passage up to the Nanami's bridge. Misato and TJ were already in motion ahead of her, TJ somehow still in the lead despite Misato's motions being boosted by her armor.

"该死..." 明日香震惊地低语。她猛地冲向门口，直奔七海号的舰桥通道。美里和 TJ 已经先她一步行动起来，尽管美里穿着装甲，TJ 却不知怎地依然领先。

They made it to the bridge in seconds. Aida's voice was already crackling over the comms in Misato's armor and over the bridge channel. "Uh, hey, guys? I'm getting all sorts of weird readings and alarms from the ship with the Mass Production Eva... Uh... my sensors say 'Critical Energy Event Detected'? I'm moving to try and put a shield around it."

他们几秒钟就赶到了桥上。艾达的声音已经在 Misato 的装甲和桥上的通讯频道中噼啪作响。“呃，嘿，伙计们？我从量产型 EVA 的船上收到了各种奇怪的读数和警报...呃...我的传感器显示‘检测到临界能量事件’？我正试图移动以在其周围建立护盾。”

"Kensuke, get out of there!" Shinji shouted over him. "The S2 engine's going to blow!"

"剑介，快离开那里！" 真嗣在他上方喊道，"S2 引擎要爆炸了！"

Asuka's eyes flickered rapidly around the carrier's status screens. The ship carrying the MP Eva was on the outside edge of the fleet, closer to the city than the rest of the ships. They could see it from here, floating a few kilometers south of the Nanami. They had nothing in terms of combat assets that could possibly take out the ship before the S2 Engine blew but Kensuke. And shooting it with the Yamato's plasma cannon would likely only trigger the blast anyway. "No, let him! He's the only thing we've got that has any chance of containing the blast before it flattens the city!"

明日香的目光在航母的状态屏幕上快速扫视。搭载着 MP 初号机的船只位于舰队外缘，比其他船只更靠近城市。从这里可以看见它，悬浮在南波南边几公里处。他们没有任何战斗资源能在 S2 引擎爆炸前摧毁那艘船，除了健介。而用大和号的等离子炮射击很可能只会提前引爆。“不，让他去！他是我们唯一有可能在爆炸摧毁城市前控制住局势的人！”

"But..." Shinji protested.

但……”真嗣抗议道。

"Not the only thing..." TJ said in a very odd tone of voice. Asuka and Shinji turned towards him. What else did they have?

"并非唯一……" TJ 用一种非常奇怪的语气说道。明日香和真嗣转向他。他们还有什么呢？

"Three seconds!" Misato shouted.

"三秒！" 葛城喊道。

Asuka's eyes went wide as TJ began to glow.

明日香瞪大了眼睛，只见 TJ 开始发光。

He began to shout. {{"SHIE-"}}

他开始大声呼喊。{{"SHIE-"}}

Outside, the MP Eva ship vanished in a blast brighter than the heart of a star.

外面，MP 伊娃号飞船在一阵比恒星核心还要耀眼的光芒中消失了。

### Chapter 39 Soulburner &Into The Fire

suka blinked furiously, trying to get her eyes to clear. Everything was still blinding afterimages. All sound had been replaced with a high pitched whine that drowned out all hearing. She was vaguely aware of Shinji trying to shield her from the spray of flying glass from the windows with his body. She could hear his voice, faintly, like he was talking from across the stadium. Bright, nearly blinding light was coming from behind him.

明日香拼命眨眼，试图让视线清晰起来。眼前仍是刺目的残影，一切声音都被尖锐的耳鸣取代，淹没了所有听觉。她隐约感觉到真嗣正用身体为她挡住飞溅的玻璃碎片。他的声音微弱传来，仿佛隔着整个体育场在说话。身后，一道耀眼得几乎令人目眩的光芒正照射过来。

"-suka! Are you alright? Can you hear me? Asuka!" He was whispering saying shouting urgently at her.

“-明日香！你还好吗？能听见我说话吗？明日香！”他急切地低声呼喊着她。

"I'm... alright?" she replied hesitantly. Her hearing was returning with the whine dropping to a mere ear-splitting high tone. She felt around on her body, finding no blood. They'd somehow ended up lying on the floor, thrown against one of the ship's control consoles. Shinji was above her, his back covered in shards of broken glass. Fortunately, it looked like their plugsuits were tough enough to resist puncturing, otherwise Shinji would have been covered in blood. He was haloed in the steady bright light, too. But there was no more blast roar, so where was the light coming from? Asuka pushed Shinji back gently and struggled to her feet.

"我...没事吧？" 她迟疑地回答。听力正逐渐恢复，尖锐的耳鸣声降为刺耳的高频音。她摸索着自己的身体，没有发现血迹。不知怎么的，两人已躺在地板上，被甩到了飞船控制台旁。真嗣压在她上方，背上满是碎玻璃片。幸好，他们的插入栓服足够坚韧，未被刺穿，否则真嗣早已血迹斑斑。他也被稳定而明亮的光环笼罩着。但爆炸的轰鸣声已消失，这光又是从何而来？明日香轻推开真嗣，挣扎着站起身来。

And saw an angel. 看见了一位天使。

She blinked again and shielded her eyes with her hand. It was TJ, but... not as usual.

她再次眨了眨眼，用手遮住眼睛。是 TJ，但……和平常不一样。

The source of the brilliant light still filling the bridge was him. His wings were out, surrounded by a glow that extended all over his body. Even mostly folded, they still almost completely blocked he view out the now smashed windows. Past him, Asuka could see the ship that had carried her Eva was gone. The closest other ships showed some signs of blast damage, but they were still afloat.

那充斥着整个舰桥的耀眼光芒，源头正是他。他的羽翼展开，被一圈光芒环绕，覆盖了全身。即便大部分折叠着，依旧几乎完全遮挡了破碎窗外的视线。透过他的身影，明日香看到载着她那台 EVA 的船只已经消失。最近的其它船只虽有爆炸损伤的痕迹，但仍漂浮在水面上。

TJ turned from the windows to her. His eyes were... gone? They were replaced by two glowing points that were as difficult to look directly at as the Sun.

TJ 从窗边转向她，他的双眼……消失了？取而代之的是两颗耀眼的光点，其难以直视的程度堪比太阳。

["I did what I could to divert the blast. The city and the fleet took some damage, but are intact. Lieutenant Aida's Black Knight was hit, however. He is not responding."]

我尽力分散了爆炸的冲击。城市和舰队受到了一些损伤，但整体完好。然而，艾达中尉的黑骑士号被击中了，目前他没有任何回应。

"What... what the Hell is going on? What happened to you?" Asuka said.

"这...这到底是怎么回事？你发生了什么？" 明日香说道。

["No Sparrow Shall Fall. I am accessing my full Family divine powers. There was no other way in time to create a shield strong enough to deflect a blast that powerful. I can maintain this state for fifty-eight minutes before burnout."]

“无雀坠落。我正在调动家族全部的神力。没有其他方法能在这么短的时间内创造出足以抵挡那种威力爆炸的护盾。我可以在耗尽前维持这种状态五十八分钟。”

That sounded ominous. "Burnout?" she asked.

那听起来不妙。“倦怠？”她问道。

["I am only of divine blood, not a true god. I am not meant to be like this, so far from our source. Also, I am very young and I am unable to draw on Avalon for strength while we are cut off. So I am powering this state by... other means."]

我仅拥有神之血脉，并非真正的神明。我不应如此远离我们的根源。况且，我还很年轻，在我们与阿瓦隆断开联系时，我无法从中汲取力量。因此，我正通过……其他方式维持这种状态。

"So stop! The blast is over! I don't want to find out what this 'burnout' entails the hard way, TJ!" Asuka helped Shinji knock the last of the glass off his back. He seemed as mostly unharmed as she was. Behind him Ching was being helped up by a now fully armored-up Misato.

“停下！爆炸结束了！我不想通过亲身体验来了解这个‘过载’到底意味着什么，TJ！” 明日香帮真嗣拍掉了背上最后一片玻璃。他看起来和她一样，基本上没有受伤。在他们身后，清正在被已经全副武装的米莎托扶起来。

["The backlash from dropping out of this state without support results in a deep coma that will require a senior Family member to awaken me from. And I believe we will need my power very soon. If Jinnai's threats are true, there will be missiles on their way already."]

从这种状态中无支持地退出会引发深度昏迷，需要家族中的资深成员才能将我唤醒。我相信我们很快就会需要我的力量。如果阵内的威胁属实，那么导弹可能已经在路上了。

"Then we need to get back to base and get airborne to intercept them. Right. Get the-" She looked out at the flight deck. The space where their modified Chinook had been parked was now empty. Nearly everything on the deck had been swept away by the part of the blast that had leaked past TJ's hasty shield. "Scheiße. Alright. We need to get back to the stadium in a hurry. TJ, can you and Ching carry us by yourselves?"

然后我们需要返回基地，起飞拦截他们。对。去拿——”她望向飞行甲板。他们改装的支奴干直升机原本停放的位置现在空空如也。甲板上几乎所有东西都被 TJ 仓促构建的护盾外泄的爆炸冲击波卷走了。“该死。好吧。我们必须迅速返回体育场。TJ，你和 Ching 能单独带我们飞回去吗？”

Ching shook her head. "You don't need me. As long as this state lasts he can damn near lift this entire ship by himself."

青摇了摇头。“你不需要我。只要这种状态持续下去，他几乎可以独自举起整艘船。”

"As long as we get to our mecha fast. Alright then, let's go." Asuka nodded at TJ.

只要我们快点赶到机甲那里。好吧，那我们走。" 明日香对 TJ 点了点头。

["Hold onto each other. It will make it easier."]

紧握彼此的手，这样会容易些。

TJ took Asuka's hand as she took Shinji's. Before she could say anything else, TJ simply knocked the remaining window frames away with one hand and leapt out the bridge windows. The rest of them trailed along after like a kite's tail. TJ's wings gave two heavy beats throwing them higher. Then there was no feeling of falling. The glow from his wings had spread to cover them and now they just floated in his wake. The fleet suddenly streaked away behind them as they shot towards the shore, but there was no sensation of movement. In a matter of moments they had covered the twenty kilometers and were zooming in to a rapid landing in the stadium.

TJ 握住明日香的手，而她则牵着真嗣。未及她开口，TJ 便单手击碎剩余的窗框，从桥上窗户一跃而出。其余人如风筝尾巴般紧随其后。TJ 的翅膀猛烈扇动两下，将他们推向更高空。随即，失重感消失，他的翅膀光芒扩散开来，将众人笼罩，他们便在他的尾流中漂浮。舰队瞬间被甩在身后，他们朝着海岸疾驰，却无丝毫移动感。转眼间，他们已跨越二十公里，急速降落在体育场内。

They landed at midfield to find Sergeant Bir, Touji, and the rest of the NERV members running to meet them. Sergeant Bir was shouting something at TJ as they landed.

他们降落在中场，发现比尔中士、透治以及其余的 NERV 成员正跑来迎接。降落时，比尔中士正朝着 TJ 大声说着什么。

"You... no! You have to stop, Lieutenant O'Brien! You can't support 'No Sparrow Shall Fall' mode without a link to Avalon except by burning your own soul! Don't do this!"

你...不！你必须停止，奥布赖恩中尉！没有与阿瓦隆的链接，你无法支持“无雀坠落”模式，除非燃烧你自己的灵魂！不要这么做！

TJ's face was a hieratic mask. He looked at Sergeant Bir with the calm dispassion of a marble statue. ["I can maintain this state for fifty-six more minutes before burnout."]

TJ 的面容如同一副庄严的面具。他以大理石雕像般的平静冷漠注视着比尔警官。["在耗尽之前，我还能维持这种状态五十六分钟。"]

"Stand down, sir! The Emperor will have my head if you die out here!"

退下，先生！如果您在这里丧命，皇帝会要了我的脑袋！

["That is not an order you can give me, Sergeant, nor one I can obey. Rajadharma. There was no other way to divert a blast that large and save us and the city. And there are more missiles already on the way. 'This we'll defend'."]

那不是你能给我的命令，中士，也不是我能服从的。职责所在。没有其他方法能转移那么大的爆炸，救下我们和城市。而且更多的导弹已经在路上了。“我们将誓死捍卫。”

The statement only provoked Bir to even louder protests. "Damn it, sir! We're cut off! You burnout here and that's it! You're gone! Dead!"

这番话只激得比尔抗议声更加响亮：“该死，先生！我们被切断了！你在这里耗尽，那就完了！你将不复存在！死定了！”

["Then I suggest we hurry."]

那我建议我们快点。

Misato spoke up, worry in her voice. "I can't raise Kensuke. I'm sending some of the Scouts to his last position and ordering Captain Borghese to get any helicopters he's got in the air for search and rescue."

惣流开口了，声音中带着担忧：“我无法抚养健介。我正派遣一些侦察兵前往他最后的位置，并命令博尔盖塞上尉将他所有的直升机升空进行搜救。”

Asuka grit her teeth. "That leaves us with just Red Whirlwind and Pride of Osaka to intercept any missiles. Damn it. Alright. Shinji and I will take off and head back along their path to Berlin, intercepting everything we can on the way. Suzuhara, you stay here and you cover the city no matter what, and as much of the region as you can. Bir, Kaji, get everyone you can into power suits and heavy weapons. Position them for terminal defense as much as we can."

明日香咬紧牙关。“那就只剩下红色旋风和大阪之傲来拦截导弹了。该死。好吧。真嗣和我将起飞，沿着他们的路径返回柏林，沿途尽可能拦截一切。铃原，你留在这里，无论如何都要保护好城市，以及尽可能多的区域。比尔，加持，尽可能让所有人穿上动力装甲，配备重型武器。尽可能做好终端防御的部署。”

["I can assist in covering the city,"] TJ said. ["And I have an idea for something else we can use that might allow him to cover the region more freely."]

“我可以帮忙监控城市，”TJ 说道，“我还有一个想法，或许能让他更自由地覆盖整个区域。”

The rest of the group stared at him. "What else have we got?" Touji asked.

其余的人盯着他。“我们还有什么？” 东治问道。

TJ pointed at the other end of the stadium. ["We activate Unit-01. Its S2 Organ will give it more than enough power to project an AT-Field to cover the entire city. We need that defense. That will let Lieutenant Suzuhara protect the rest of the region."]

TJ 指向体育场的另一端。["我们启动零号机。其 S2 机关将赋予它足够的力量，以投射出覆盖整个城市的 AT 力场。我们需要这种防御。这将使铃原上尉能够保护该地区的其余部分。"]

"What?! No!" Shinji exclaimed. "I'm not staying here in that thing while Asuka heads off alone on a mission this dangerous! And it's dead! There's no soul in its Core to activate it anyway! I'm not going to Pilot it again!"

"什么？！不行！" 真嗣惊呼道，"我不能留在这里，让明日香一个人去执行这么危险的任务！而且它已经死了！核心里没有灵魂可以激活它！我不会再驾驶它了！"

["It does not have to be you, sir. One of the support platoon's new enlistees explained how it worked. Even a partial soul can activate an Evangelion. We know that from Unit-00. A fragment of Ayanami's soul was sufficient to make it work, if agonizing on her. The private who told me this explained that as long as the soul in the Core and the Pilot match, enough synch is possible to make it run. It will be unspeakably painful, but it will work. In this state I can easily do the soul manipulation needed to divide a soul and implant the fragment in the Core."]

不必非得是您，先生。支援排的一名新兵向我说明了原理。即使是残缺的灵魂也能启动福音战士。我们从零号机得知，只要有绫波的灵魂碎片就足以使其运作，尽管对她来说极为痛苦。那位士兵解释说，只要核心中的灵魂与驾驶员匹配，就能实现足够的同步，使其运行。虽然会无比痛苦，但这是可行的。在这种状态下，我可以轻松地进行灵魂操控，将灵魂分割并植入核心碎片。

Asuka felt her heart skip. "A divided soul is what drove my mother insane, TJ. I'm not letting you do that to yourself or one of us," she said.

明日香感到心跳漏了一拍。“分裂的灵魂让我母亲疯了，TJ。我不会让你这样对自己或我们中的任何一个，”她说。

["I can accomplish the split without the madness that the accidental damage that affected your mother, ma'am. The private said he would volunteer if it became necessary. He was very firm about it. He said that he knew the risks, and that he... owed it to you?"]

我能完成分裂，不会像意外伤害您母亲那样陷入疯狂，夫人。那位士兵说他愿意在必要时自愿承担。他非常坚决。他说他了解风险，而且他……欠您的？

"What? Who? What kind of idiot would say something like that?" Asuka said, horrified. "Get him over here."

"什么？谁？哪个蠢货会说出这种话？" 明日香惊恐地说，"把他带过来。"

["Private Rokubungi, front and center!"] TJ shouted towards the marshalling crowd of Imperial soldiers near the mecha.

["六本木一等兵，到前面来！"］TJ 对着靠近机甲的帝国士兵集结的人群大声喊道。

"Sir!" A deep, familiar voice answered.

"先生！"一个低沉而熟悉的声音回应道。

"What?" Asuka burst out. "什么？" 明日香脱口而出。

"No..." Shinji said, eyes wide, as a tall, thin man in an Imperial Army private's uniform jogged over and came to attention in front of TJ. He had no glasses, no beard, and no hair under his cap, but it was the voice and the face with features disturbingly like Shinji's own that made it unmistakable.

"不..." 新二说道，眼睛睁得大大的，只见一个高瘦的男子穿着帝国陆军列兵制服跑过来，在 TJ 面前立正站好。他没有戴眼镜，没有胡须，帽檐下也没有头发，但那声音和那张酷似新二自己的面孔，让人绝不会认错。

Gendo Ikari stood ready to volunteer.

源堂イカリ已做好自愿参与的准备。

He barely had a second to stand ready before Shinji grabbed him by the uniform front and shouted in his face. "What the Hell are you doing here?!"

他还没来得及站稳，真嗣就一把抓住他的制服前襟，冲着他脸大喊：“你他妈在这儿干什么？！”

"Keeping my promise," Gendo said levelly. "I said I'd find a way to atone. If submitting myself to the same treatment I put you and Rei through aids that, I will do it. I stayed out of sight because I know my mere presence causes you both pain." He looked at Asuka for a moment, then back to Shinji, whose face was still just inches from his own. "I think you understand now, how powerful the desire can be to do whatever you have to just to stay by the side of the one who makes your whole world right. Don't you?"

"遵守我的承诺，"源渡平静地说道，"我说过我会找到赎罪的方法。如果让我接受我曾经对你们和零号施加的同样待遇能有助于此，我愿意去做。我选择隐匿行踪，是因为我知道我的出现只会给你们带来痛苦。"他短暂地看向明日香，然后目光又回到真嗣身上，两人的脸庞仅咫尺之遥。"我想你现在应该明白了，那种为了留在让整个世界变得正确的人身边，而愿意不惜一切的强烈愿望。不是吗？"

"I'll never do the kind of things you did. I've made sure of it. She won't let me be like you," Shinji grated. "I'm not you. I will never be you."

“我绝不会做出你那样的行为。我已经确保了这一点。她也不会让我变得像你一样，”真嗣咬牙切齿地说。“我不是你。我永远不会成为你。”

"Your mother agrees, but I think you are enough that you can still understand why. And that means you can understand how badly I want to earn your forgiveness, so that I might earn your mother's. You know that means everything to me."

你母亲也同意，但我认为你足够聪明，能理解其中的缘由。这意味着你也能理解我多么渴望得到你的宽恕，从而可能获得你母亲的谅解。你知道这对我来说意味着一切。

Shinji's face was still a mask of anger. "Father-"

真嗣的脸依旧是一副愤怒的面具。“父亲——”

TJ looked at him in surprise. ["Wait... he's your father?"]

TJ 惊讶地看着他。["等等...他是你父亲？"]

Asuka stared at him. "What, he never mentioned it? That's the once-upon-a-time Commander of NERV, Gendo Ikari, Shinji's not-beloved-at-all father! He's been hiding with us the whole time as 'Private Rokubungi'?"

明日香盯着他。“什么，他没提过吗？那就是曾经的 NERV 指挥官，源堂元帅，真嗣一点也不亲爱的父亲！他一直以‘六分仪先生’的身份和我们一起躲藏呢。”

["All he told me was he was part of the design team for the Evangelions, wanted to offer that expertise to help with Unit-01, and had personal reasons for staying out of your way. He asked that I not pry and assured me he meant no harm to any of you, only help. He was being truthful, so I let him be."]

他只告诉我他是使徒设计团队的一员，希望将他的专业知识用于帮助零号机，并且出于个人原因不想打扰你们。他请求我不要追问，并保证他对你们没有恶意，只想提供帮助。他说的都是实话，所以我让他去了。

Asuka ground her teeth. She fully well empathized with Shinji's impulse to break his father's nose again. She wanted to beat Gendo's head in almost as much. But that was a luxury they didn't have time for. "Shinji, let him go."

明日香咬紧牙关，她完全理解真嗣想要再次打破他父亲鼻子的冲动。她几乎也想要痛打源渡一顿。但这是他们没有时间享受的奢侈。“真嗣，放开他。”

He looked at her, shocked. "What? We can't-"

他震惊地看着她。“什么？我们不能——”

"We don't have time! If he's prepared to do this, we need to let him! We need Unit-01 as a backup. And it's about time he learned what he put us through as Pilots."

我们没时间了！如果他决心这么做，我们就得让他去！我们需要零号机作为后备。也该让他明白，作为驾驶员，他给我们带来了怎样的困境。

Shinji glared at his father for a moment longer, then released him with a look of disgust. "Don't think this settles anything, father."

真嗣又瞪了父亲一会儿，随后带着厌恶的表情放开了他。“别以为这样就解决了什么，父亲。”

"I am well aware of how deep my sins against you both are. Yui made that very clear. But if this earns me even a milligram of redemption, it is worth it. I am ready, Lieutenant O'Brien. Proceed."

我深知自己对你们二人的罪孽有多深重，结衣已经说得非常清楚。但如果这能为我赢得哪怕一毫克的救赎，那也是值得的。我准备好了，奥布赖恩中尉，请开始吧。

Shinji stepped back as TJ placed himself in front of Gendo. TJ held his hand out at chest height and simply said, ["Come."]

真嗣后退一步，TJ 则站到了元渡面前。TJ 将手伸至胸前高度，简洁地说道：["来吧。"]

A flash of white light, and a slender sword appeared below his hand, hovering point-down. Asuka watched in wonder. He'd told them about this in the past weeks, when she'd asked just what being a Prince Of The Blood meant. TJ's Echo of the First Blade, a shadow-copy of Axion, the sword his great-grandfather had forged before the founding of Avalon, was one facet of his status as a Prince. Tied to his person, it had an amazing variety of magical and spiritual abilities, the most key of which right now was that it was, as he'd put it, 'sharp enough to cut souls'.

一道白光闪过，一柄细剑出现在他手下方，剑尖朝下悬浮着。明日香惊叹地注视着。在过去几周里，当她询问成为皇族意味着什么时，他曾向她讲述过这一点。TJ 的“初刃回响”，是阿克西翁之剑的影之复制品，那柄剑是他曾祖父在阿瓦隆建立之前锻造的，这是他作为皇族身份的一个方面。这把剑与他个人紧密相连，拥有多种神奇和灵性能力，其中最关键的是，正如他所描述的，“锋利到足以切割灵魂”。

TJ wrapped his hand around the hilt and raised it over Gendo. ["Ready?"]

TJ 握住剑柄，将其高举过元道头顶。["准备好了吗？"]

Gendo just nodded. 源渡只是点了点头。

TJ swept the blade down through Gendo from head to feet in a blur almost too fast to see.

TJ 以肉眼几乎难以捕捉的极速，从上至下挥刀贯穿了源堂的全身。

Gendo screamed. 源堂尖叫起来。

Everyone flinched, Shinji and Asuka especially. Asuka tried to keep her face calm, but it was not easy. Her skin crawled. She knew that sound. She'd sounded like that when the Mass Production Eva had put a False Lance through Unit-02's skull when she and Mama were fully synched. Thanks to Instrumentality's sharing of their memories, she knew Shinji had made the same sound when he'd surfaced from the Geofront in the last battle and seen the MP Evas chewing on the pieces of Unit-02.

众人皆是一惊，真嗣和明日香尤甚。明日香试图保持面容平静，但这并不容易。她的皮肤感到一阵刺痛。她认得那个声音。当量产型 EVA 用伪神枪贯穿零号机头颅时，她和妈妈完全同步，那时她也曾发出过类似的声音。得益于人类补完计划共享的记忆，她知道真嗣在最后战役中从地下都市浮现，目睹量产型 EVA 啃食零号机残骸时，也发出了同样的声音。

Gendo collapsed to his knees and threw up, his face suddenly sheened in sweat. "Oh gods... oh gods... it hurts! Rei... I'm so sorry! I didn't know! I didn't know it hurt like this! I'm sorry..." he sobbed into the dirt of the field.

源渡跪倒在地，呕吐起来，脸上突然冒出豆大的汗珠。“哦，天啊……哦，天啊……好痛！丽……对不起！我不知道！我不知道会这么痛！对不起……”他哽咽着，声音埋没在田野的泥土中。

TJ ignored him, making strange gestures with his free hand around a barely visible dull silver shimmer in the air in front of him. He gathered it into his hand and made a broad throwing motion towards Unit-01. The towering purple Evangelion's eyes flashed from black to white again as the red crystal Core in its chest absorbed whatever it was that TJ had thrown.

TJ 对他置之不理，用空闲的手在面前空气中隐约可见的暗银色微光周围做出奇怪的手势。他将那微光聚拢于掌心，然后向着 Unit-01 做出一个大幅度的投掷动作。那高耸的紫色福音战士眼中，黑色瞬间转为白色，其胸前的红色水晶核心吸收了 TJ 投掷而来的未知之物。

["A quarter of his soul is now activating the Core. Unit-01 is ready. He and I can cover the city. The S2 organ will give us all the power we need. If we are lucky, I can combine it with my own and tap it to extend my limit before burnout. Lieutenant Suzuhara can protect the whole region we've cleared."]

他四分之一的灵魂正在激活核心。初号机已准备就绪。他和我就足以守护这座城市。S2 机关将为我们提供所需的一切力量。若幸运，我还能将其与我的力量结合，在过载前突破极限。铃原少尉能保护我们已清空的整个区域。

"Is he even able to move right now?" Asuka asked. Gendo was still on his hands and knees, shaking and weeping in anguish. He raised his head at her question and nodded, meeting Shinji's eyes.

"他现在还能动吗？"明日香问道。源堂依旧双手双膝着地，颤抖着，痛苦地哭泣。听到她的问题，他抬起头，点了点头，与真嗣的目光相遇。

"I... can. I must." 我……能行。我必须这么做。

"Doesn't he need a plugsuit and an A-10 headset and all that stuff to synch? I thought ya needed that?" Touji asked, looking unsettled at Gendo's reaction.

"他不需要插入栓服和 A-10 耳机那些东西来同步吗？我以为需要那些呢？" 东治问道，对源堂的反应感到不安。

["Those things were aids, but not required. I can help force the synch with both parts of his soul. It will feel like pushing the ends of a broken bone together, but it will work,"] TJ replied. ["Go. He and I will protect the city."] He grabbed Gendo by the shoulder and flung them both into the air towards Unit-01's neck. The massive head was already tilting forward to allow the Entry Plug to spin out of its slot and open up.

那些东西只是辅助，并非必需。我可以帮忙强行同步他灵魂的两部分。那感觉就像把断骨的两端硬推到一起，但会奏效的。”TJ 回答道。“去吧。我和他会保护这座城市。”他抓住源堂的肩膀，将两人一同抛向初号机的颈部。巨大的头部已经前倾，以便插入栓从插槽中旋转出来并打开。

Asuka spared them one glance before turning to Touji and shoving his towards his mecha. "Get moving, Stooge. You've got to catch anything that gets by Shinji and me. There are millions of people in the region around the city. Don't fail. Misato, Kaji, get moving with the Scouts and every other suit you can scrape up." The other NERV members bolted off, and she turned back to grab Shinji's hand. He had turned to face Ching.

明日香瞥了他们一眼，随即转向东治，将他推向自己的机甲。“动起来，跟班。你得拦截住我和真嗣漏过的任何东西。城市周边有数百万民众。别搞砸了。美里，加持，带上侦察兵和能召集到的所有装甲，立刻行动。”其他 NERV 成员迅速离去，她转而抓住真嗣的手。他已转身面对阿静。

"Ching, come with me. Asuka, you should stay here," Shinji said, avoiding Asuka's eyes.

"绫波，跟我来。明日香，你留在这里吧。" 真嗣说着，避开了明日香的目光。

"What." Asuka's voice was dangerously flat.

"什么。" 明日香的声音危险地平淡。

"Ching can pilot Red Whirlwind with me. She's more than able. We don't have to risk us both. You don't have to do this."

青可以和我一起驾驶红色旋风。她完全有能力。我们不必同时冒险。你不必这么做。

"What?" Asuka's growl was harsh and angry now.

"什么？" 明日香此刻的咆哮既刺耳又愤怒。

Shinji raised his head to meet her eyes. He hadn't looked so anxious or fearful since the fight in Berlin. He had to try a few times to speak. "I... I can't lose you. These are N2 warheads Jinnai's throwing. Even Red Whirlwind's shields can only shrug off so much. We have to stop them. Even if we have to... do it the hard way. You're... I can't... not both of you. I can't lose you again. Or her. Ching can pilot with me, and-"

真嗣抬起头，迎上她的目光。自从柏林之战后，他从未显得如此焦虑和恐惧。他尝试了几次才开口：“我……我不能失去你。金井投掷的是 N2 弹头，即便是红色旋风的护盾也只能抵挡这么多。我们必须阻止他们，哪怕不得不……采取强硬手段。你……我不能……不能失去你们两个。我不能再失去你，也不能失去她。晶可以和我一起驾驶，而且——”

The slap was louder than thunder, barely heard over the sound of the departing.

那一巴掌比雷声还响，几乎被离去的脚步声所掩盖。

"How dare you?" Asuka snarled.

"你怎么敢？" 明日香咆哮道。

Shinji didn't move his head from where her slap had rocked it around. "Please..." he begged. "This is dangerous."

真嗣没有将头从她那一巴掌的冲击中移开。“求你了……”他哀求道，“这很危险。”

"Do you think I'm useless? Helpless?"

"你认为我无用吗？无助吗？"

"You're not useless! You're too important to me! I can't... if you died..."

你并非无用！你对我太重要了！我无法承受……如果你离世……

"Me?! What about you? Du verflucht Idiot! Du hirnlose Ochse!" She pressed right up in his face, stabbing him in the chest with her fingers. "You don't get to do this. Not to me. Not again. You owe me a life, Ikari! You promised! So I'm claiming this one! I have just as much right here to risk my life as you do, and I'll be damned before I let you run off and maybe get killed without me! You go where I go and vice versa, remember? And what the Hell am I supposed to do if you die?!" Her vision was blurring and she could feel her cheeks were wet. It didn't matter. She was still able to punch him in the chest. "I love you, du verdammt baka! Live or die, you're staying right by my side! Together! You promised!"

"我？！那你呢？你这该死的白痴！没脑子的蠢牛！" 她紧贴着他的脸，用手指戳着他的胸口。"你没有权利这么做，不是对我，不是再次。你欠我一条命，碇！你承诺过的！所以我要索取这条命！我在这里冒险的权利和你一样，我绝不允许你独自跑掉，可能送命而没有我！你去哪我就去哪，反之亦然，记得吗？如果你死了，我该怎么办？！" 她的视线模糊了，感觉到脸颊湿润。这无关紧要。她仍然能用力捶打他的胸膛。"我爱你，你这该死的傻瓜！无论生死，你都要留在我身边！一起！你承诺过的！"

Shinji stared wide eyed at her for a moment. Slowly, his hands came up to cup her face. "You... you fight dirty. I love you, too. Let's go." He gave her a single fierce kiss, and then grabbed her hand. They ran for Red Whirlwind together.

真嗣瞪大眼睛凝视了她一会儿。缓缓地，他的双手抬起，捧住她的脸颊。“你……你真会耍手段。我也爱你。我们走吧。”他给了她一个热烈的吻，随即握住她的手。两人一同向红色旋风奔去。

Part 76 第 76 章

Into The Fire 烈焰之中

They didn't even have to say anything as they spun up Red Whirlwind's systems in record time, just a few impulses and silent communications over the mental bridge. Asuka flung them skyward with the antigrav at what would have been terrifying speed if Shinji hadn't felt her absolute focus and confidence. They just saw Unit-01 standing up and turning it's head to watch them launch as they flew off.

他们甚至无需言语，便以破纪录的速度启动了“红色旋风”系统，仅凭几下脉冲和心灵桥梁上的无声交流。明日香借助反重力装置将他们猛地抛向高空，若非感受到真嗣那绝对的专注与自信，这速度定会令人心惊胆战。他们只瞥见初号机站立起身，转头目送他们飞离。

It took them only moments to be dozens of kilometers high and rising, arcing their course northeast. Sweeping a visual sensor downward to watch Buenos Aires rapidly recede below them at the same time as he probed upwards and forwards along their flight path with radar and other sensors, Shinji saw the flash just off the coast of Argentina. A quick sweep with radar confirmed his fear; the flash was a missile launch.

他们仅用片刻便攀升至数十公里高空，向东北方向划出弧线。真嗣一边用视觉传感器俯瞰着布宜诺斯艾利斯迅速远去的景象，一边用雷达和其他传感器向前上方探测飞行路径，就在此时，他瞥见了阿根廷海岸附近的一道闪光。雷达的快速扫描证实了他的担忧：那闪光是一次导弹发射。

"Asuka, something just launched east-southeast of the city! I've got... two missiles on ballistic trajectories headed for Buenos Aires!"

明日香，城市东南方向刚刚发射了什么东西！我这里监测到……两枚导弹正沿着弹道轨迹飞向布宜诺斯艾利斯！

"I see it!" she replied. "We can divert to stop them, but that'll kill our vector for Germany. Can we hit it from here with the emitters?"

"我看到了！"她回答道，"我们可以绕道去阻止他们，但那样会破坏我们去德国的航线。我们能从这里用发射器攻击吗？"

"On it!" Shinji aimed one of Red Whirlwind's main mulit-spectrum energy emitters downward and set it for a microwave laser that would most easily penetrate the atmosphere. Avaloni targeting computers and his aim fought with their speed, range, and the chaotic turbulence of Earth's skies. Seconds ticked past until Shinji felt the confidence of the mecha's AI through the link that they had a good target lock. He fired, and one of the missiles exploded into fragments that sank into the Atlantic.

"开始！" 新二将红色旋风的一个主多谱能量发射器对准下方，并将其设置为微波激光，以便最容易穿透大气层。阿瓦隆尼瞄准计算机与他的瞄准速度、射程以及地球天空中的混乱湍流作斗争。几秒钟过去了，直到新二通过与机甲 AI 的链接感受到他们已锁定良好目标的信心。他开火，一枚导弹爆炸成碎片，沉入大西洋。

The second missile began to bob and weave, shifting its course to evade. The rapidly opening range as Red Whirlwind continued to rise was making a second shot impossible. "Touji, we're heading out of range too fast to hit the second one! Can you intercept?" Shinji shouted over the radio.

第二枚导弹开始摇摆躲避，调整航线以规避攻击。随着“红色旋风”持续上升，迅速扩大的距离使得第二次射击变得不可能。“冬二，我们正快速超出射程，无法击中第二枚！你能拦截吗？”真嗣通过无线电大声呼叫。

"I got it! I got it!" his friend answered. Pride of Osaka was heading right for the incoming missile. At much lower speed and closer range missile's evasive capabilities were no match for the Black Knight, and Touji quickly splashed the second missile with little trouble. The effort had pulled him a little away from the city, though, and he turned around to loop back.

"我接到了！我接到了！"他的朋友回答道。大阪的骄傲正直冲向迎面而来的导弹。在较低的速度和更近的距离下，导弹的规避能力根本不是黑骑士的对手，东二迅速轻松地击落了第二枚导弹。尽管此举让他稍稍远离了城市，但他随即转身，准备绕回。

"Stooge, keep going out to sea!" Asuka ordered. "I heard rumors Jinnai had found and reconditioned an old Russian boomer, but I thought they were bullshit. There's got to be a sub out there that launched those, and if it's got two it's got more! Find it and sink it!"

"助手，继续出海！"飞鸟命令道，"我听说神无伊找到并修复了一艘老俄潜艇的传闻，但我觉得那是扯淡。肯定有艘潜艇发射了那些东西，如果它能发射两枚，就一定还有更多！找到它，击沉它！"

"Roger! I'll find it!" "罗杰！我会找到它的！"

They kept accelerating, the curvature of the Earth growing more visible beneath them. Asuka was forced to level off at much lower altitude than she wanted to. They needed to stay along the path current generation ICBMs would take, not the least-time transit path Red Whirlwind could make. The low-altitude, high-turbulence path would mean they'd have to get much closer than she was comfortable with to the missiles to be sure of knocking them down.

他们持续加速，地球的曲率在他们下方愈发明显。明日香被迫在远低于预期的高度平飞。他们需要沿着当前一代洲际弹道导弹的轨迹飞行，而非红旋风能实现的最短路径。低空、高湍流的路线意味着他们必须比明日香所愿更接近导弹，以确保能够击落它们。

Even with their best speed and the missiles rushing to meet them, they still had a few minutes before they'd even sight the first launches rising over the horizon. Shinji hear Asuka rap out a few more orders to Ching and Bir about distributing their troops to cover the city and vicinity, and the odd prickle on their sensors as they felt the huge AT-Field of Unit-01 light up over Buenos Aires. Silence fell for a moment.

尽管他们以最快速度前进，导弹也急速迎面而来，但仍需数分钟才能目睹地平线上升起的第一波发射。真嗣听到明日香迅速向青和比尔下达命令，部署部队以保护城市及周边地区，同时感受到传感器上因布宜诺斯艾利斯上空初号机巨大的 AT 力场激活而产生的微妙刺痛。一时间，四周陷入了寂静。

Shinji finally took a breath and indulged in a brief celebration. Asuka felt his bubbling joy over the link and pulsed an inquisitive nudge at him over they bridge.

真嗣终于松了一口气，沉浸在短暂的庆祝中。明日香通过链接感受到他洋溢的喜悦，便通过桥梁向他发出了一丝好奇的触碰。

He smiled at her in the comm window. "You said it, Asuka. You finally said it."

他在通讯窗口对她微笑着说：“你说了，明日香。你终于说出来了。”

She blinked at him. "Said what?"

她眨了眨眼，问道：“说了什么？”

"'I love you.'" "我爱你。"

Asuka stared blankly at him for a second before it sank in. Her eyes widened. "Well... scheiße..." she said eventually. "So much for talking about it tonight in more romantic surroundings. When I said 'right before a battle isn't exactly how or where I want to talk about this', I did mean it."

明日香愣愣地盯着他看了一秒，然后才反应过来。她的眼睛瞪大了。“好吧...该死...”她最终说道。“看来今晚在更浪漫的环境里讨论这事是没戏了。我说的‘在战斗前谈这个，并不是我想要的时间或地点’，我是认真的。”

Shinji's smile got bigger. "Somehow, right before a battle for our lives seems fitting for us."

真嗣的笑容更灿烂了。“不知怎的，在为生命而战的前一刻，对我们来说似乎正合适。”

"As does doing it together, Third Child! Don't you ever try to pull something like that again!" Asuka growled at him. "Your life is mine, all of it, until the very end! You promised!"

就像一起做那样，第三子！你再敢耍这种花招试试！”明日香对他咆哮道，“你的命是我的，全部都是，直到最后！你承诺过的！

"And is yours mine?" Shinji asked carefully, like he was petting a tiger.

"你的也是我的吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地问道，仿佛在抚摸一只老虎。

Asuka suddenly couldn't meet his eyes. "We... we'll talk about it tonight. Assuming we both live through this."

明日香突然无法直视他的眼睛。“我们……我们今晚再谈这个。前提是我们都能活过今天。”

Shinji never lost his smile. The hints of her feelings he could feel over the link were more than enough. He gripped the controls tighter. "To Hell with dying. I'm going to live!"

真嗣从未失去他的笑容。通过链接感受到的她情感的微妙暗示已足够。他更紧地握住操纵杆。“去他的死亡。我要活下去！”

It was only minutes before the first missiles peeked over the curve of the Earth. Multiple ICBMs popped on their radar as they screamed over the southern Atlantic. But almost as soon as they cleared the horizon, their sensors started to blur.

仅仅几分钟后，第一批导弹便从地球曲面探出头来。多枚洲际弹道导弹在雷达上显现，它们呼啸着掠过南大西洋上空。然而，几乎刚一越过地平线，它们的传感器就开始变得模糊不清。

"Great," Asuka said. "He installed jammers."

"太好了，"明日香说，"他装了干扰器。"

Shinji played with the systems. "I can burn through some of it, but... nnngg. We're going to have to get close to be sure of kill-hits."

真嗣操作着系统。“我能消耗掉一部分，但是……嗯。我们得靠近点才能确保致命一击。”

"Shields at full strength," Asuka responded. "We can tank them the hard way if we have to. Lasers ready?"

"护盾全开，"明日香回应道，"必要时我们可以硬扛。激光准备好了吗？"

Shinji nodded. "First shot in three, two, one..."

真嗣点头道：“三秒后发射第一枪，三，二，一……”

The lead ICBM was an outlier, well ahead of its fellows. Shinji's shot burned right through it easily, and it disintegrated in a chaotic tumble of parts. Shinji let out the breath he'd been holding. "Target down."

领头的洲际弹道导弹是个异类，远远领先于同伴。真嗣的射击轻松穿透了它，使其在一片混乱的零件翻滚中解体。真嗣这才呼出一直憋着的那口气。“目标已击落。”

"That was the easy one. Here comes the next seven," Asuka said. "At least one is a jammer bird. We're going to have to get closer."

“那个简单，接下来是七个，”明日香说道，“至少有一个是干扰机。我们得靠近点。”

The pack of missiles was in a tight formation. A single close blast might have been able to take them out, but Red Whirlwind lacked the plasma cannon Yamato had had. Against what weapons they did have the jamming was good enough to frustrate a lock, and they had to be sure. Neither of them wanted to let any through if they could help it. Even with their friends backing them up on the ground, it was still better to stop the missiles here.

导弹群保持着紧密的队形。一次近距离的爆炸或许能将它们一网打尽，但红旋风号缺乏大和号拥有的等离子加农炮。面对他们现有的武器，干扰效果足以阻碍锁定，他们必须确保万无一失。如果可能，两人都不愿放任何一枚导弹通过。即便地面有友军支援，在这里拦截导弹仍是上策。

The range was getting very close. "Shinji..." Asuka began.

距离已经非常接近了。“真嗣……”明日香开口道。

He knew what she was going to say. "I'm trying. I can't get a lock! They... there!" He fired.

他知道她要说什么。“我在努力。我锁定不了！他们……在那儿！”他开火了。

One missile in the group dropped away, burning. Then a second. The next was the jammer. But Shinji's shout of triumph as the rest of the missiles briefly stood out totally clear on his scope was cut off by the sudden flash of too-bright light. The blast of the N2 warhead detonating hammered on their shields.

编队中的一枚导弹脱离，燃烧起来。接着是第二枚。下一枚是干扰器。但当其余导弹在真嗣的雷达上短暂清晰显现时，他胜利的呼喊被突如其来的刺眼光芒打断。N2 弹头爆炸的冲击波猛烈撞击着他们的护盾。

"GRRrrrnng!" Asuka snarled at the impact. "He put deadman triggers on the jammers? What an asshole!" She checked Red Whirlwind's status readout. "Shields down 8%, even at this distance. That was a damn big N2 mine. He's serious about wiping out Buenos Aires, and half the Pampas if any of those hit."

"GRRrrrnng!" 明日香因撞击而咆哮，"他在干扰器上装了死人触发器？真是个混蛋！" 她查看了红色旋风的状况显示，"护盾下降了 8%，即使在这个距离。那是个该死的大型 N2 地雷。他是铁了心要摧毁布宜诺斯艾利斯，还有半数的潘帕斯草原，如果那些地雷中有任何一个爆炸的话。"

"Backtrack on the trajectories is all the same. They're all coming from one spot," Shinji said.

"回溯这些轨迹，它们都源自同一个点。" 真嗣说道。

Asuka nodded. "Has to be the launch complex near Potsdam. Winthrop kept all the N2 mines stockpiled there where he could keep an eye on them. The UN had launchers there too. Hooray for security paranoia putting it all in one place. Setting our course for there."

明日香点头道：“肯定是波茨坦附近的那个发射场。温思罗普把所有 N2 地雷都存放在那里，方便他随时监控。联合国也在那儿设有发射器。安全偏执狂把所有东西都集中在一处，真是太好了。我们就朝那儿去。”

She pushed Red Whirlwind faster, now that they had a specific target destination. More and more missiles rose to meet them. Shinji burned them down as fast as he could, but every pack had at least one deadman switch, and the blasts got closer and harsher. Red Whirlwind's shields began to wither. Larger and larger groups of missiles came at them, and even Shinji's shooting could no longer hit them all. Even when Asuka also began firing with the other weapons, some started to leak through.

她催促着红旋风加速前行，既然已有了明确的目标地点。越来越多的导弹升空迎向他们。真嗣竭尽全力将它们击落，但每组导弹至少都有一个自毁开关，爆炸愈发逼近且猛烈。红旋风的护盾开始衰减。更大规模的导弹群向他们袭来，连真嗣的射击也无法全部命中。即便明日香也开始用其他武器开火，仍有部分导弹开始穿透防线。

"Damn it!" Asuka cried. "Ching! We missed another three! They're on their way to you, 52 kilometers behind the last set! Touji, can you catch them?"

"该死！"明日香喊道，"青！我们又漏了三个！它们正朝你那边去，在最后一组后面 52 公里！东治，你能截住它们吗？"

Touji's strained face popped up in a new comm window. "I'm still playing tag with that fucking sub! It's fired off a spray of cruise missiles at damn near wave-level! I'm chasing the bunch heading north, but I can't reach the ones headed for the city in time!"

透基紧绷的面孔突然出现在一个新的通讯窗口中。“我还在跟那该死的潜艇玩捉迷藏！它几乎在波面高度发射了一波巡航导弹！我正在追赶向北的那批，但来不及拦截飞向城市的那几枚了！”

Shinji's face twisted in a near snarl as his father's face appeared in its own window. "We... we've got... the city... covered," he panted, his face a mask of pain. "Lieutenant O'Brien... and I... will hold... the shield. I swear."

真嗣的脸因痛苦而扭曲，几乎要咆哮出来，此时他父亲的影像出现在另一个窗口中。“我们……我们已……覆盖了……城市，”他喘息着，面容因痛苦而僵硬。“奥布赖恩中尉……和我……将维持……护盾。我发誓。”

Bir's voice came across the net without a window. "I sure hope so, Private Rokubungi. First impact is in ten seconds. The Emperor Protects."

比尔的声音透过网络传来，没有一丝窗口的痕迹。“我真心希望如此，六文君。首次撞击将在十秒后发生。皇帝庇佑。”

Gendo's window went blank as the N2 mines struck. Shinji didn't know what to feel as the window cleared again moments later and his father was still alive.

源渡面前的窗口在 N2 地雷袭击下变得一片空白。当窗口再次清晰时，真嗣不知该如何感受，因为他的父亲依然活着。

"AAAAGGH!" Gendo screamed in sympathetic tramsmitted pain from the fusion-hot blast against Unit-01's AT-Field. He grimly hung on. "First... missile... blocked. Unit-01... ready for... the next."

"啊啊啊啊啊！" 源堂因感受到与初号机 AT 力场相撞的核融合般炽热冲击而痛苦地大叫。他紧咬牙关坚持着。"第一枚……导弹……已拦截。初号机……准备迎接……下一波。"

"Good job, Private." Asuka's tone was surprisingly lacking in mockery as she quoted his own solitary praising of Shinji after their battle agains Sahaquiel back at him. "You should have two minutes before the next salvo arrives. Misato, any sign of Aida?"

"干得好，一等兵。" 明日香引用他在与萨拉菲尔战斗后独自赞扬真嗣的话，语气出乎意料地没有嘲讽。"你还有两分钟，下一波攻击就要来了。美里，有相田的迹象吗？"

Misato looked fairly grim herself in her window as she shook her head. "Nothing. No beacon, no comms, nothing at all. We can't even locate a wreck."

在舷窗中，葛城美里自己看起来也相当严肃，她摇了摇头。“什么都没有。没有信号，没有通讯，什么都没有。我们甚至找不到残骸。”

"Keep looking. We don't leave anyone on the battlefield alone. Never alone."

继续寻找。我们不会让任何人在战场上孤立无援。永远不会孤立。

Misato nodded agreement. "Roger. We'll find him."

葛城点头同意。“收到。我们会找到他。”
Author's Note, 28JAN21: I should remember to update this more rapidly. And hey, Asuka finally said it! And then cursed at him in German, but that's par for the course. Also, did everyone enjoy Gendo getting stabbed in the soul? As Rei could tell him, emthat hurts/em./p

作者注，2021 年 1 月 28 日：我得记得更频繁地更新这里。嘿，明日香终于说出口了！然后还用德语骂了他，不过这也在意料之中。另外，大家喜欢看到源堂被灵魂刺穿的那一幕吗？正如零可以告诉他的，那可真疼。

### Chapter 40 Potsdam Landing & Through Fire And Storm

Yet another blast shook them as they crossed into the skies over Germany. "Shields at 43%" Asuka said through gritted teeth. "That looks like the last flight of missiles."

当他们飞越德国上空时，又一次爆炸震撼了他们。“护盾剩余 43%。”明日香咬紧牙关说道，“看来这是最后一波导弹了。”

Shinji shook his head. "Jinnai's the most paranoid lunatic in the world by now. He's got to be holding more back. Shorter range ones, if nothing else. And..." Shinji grimaced. "He's got conventional fusion warheads too, not just the N2 ones. I wouldn't put it past him to try throwing some of those at us when he sees us still coming."

真嗣摇了摇头。“如今，阵内绝对是世界上最偏执的疯子。他肯定还藏着一手，就算不是远程的，也必然有短程的。而且……”真嗣皱起了眉头，“他不仅有 N2 武器，还有常规聚变弹头。我敢肯定，一旦看到我们继续前进，他就会试图用那些东西来对付我们。”

"Then we'd better be ready with the counter-fire so he can't land a hit on us," Asuka said grimly. A flashing alert on the screen grabbed her eyes. "Incoming SAMs from Stuttgart area. Probably old NATO stuff, no threat."

"那我们最好准备好反击，让他无法击中我们，"明日香冷冷地说。屏幕上闪烁的警报吸引了她的目光。"来自斯图加特地区的来袭地对空导弹。可能是旧北约的装备，没有威胁。"

"They know where we are, though."

他们知道我们在哪儿。

Asuka shrugged. "Even if they scramble fighters or whatever, nothing he can throw at us is going to pack anything near the punch to get through our shields but the big missiles. We are going to outrun most of it anyhow."

明日香耸了耸肩。“就算他们出动战斗机什么的，他扔向我们的任何东西都不可能接近大导弹那样穿透我们的护盾。我们还是会甩掉大部分攻击的。”

Asuka's prediction was quickly borne out. A handful of fighters did try to rise to intercept them, but none even got to their altitude before they shot past. Even a last few missiles failed to get close, falling to Shinji's fire. There weren't even any further missiles once they passed Weimar. They were across the breadth of Germany in short order with no further damage.

明日香的预言很快得到了验证。确实有几架战斗机试图升空拦截，但它们甚至还没达到相同高度，就被他们迅速超越。即便是最后几枚导弹也未能接近，被真嗣的火力击落。一旦他们越过魏玛，便再也没有导弹来袭。他们迅速横穿德国全境，未受任何损伤。

Until they were almost in sight of Potsdam.

直到他们几乎望见波茨坦。

A last barrage of missiles and jammers suddenly blossomed on their screen, close in and headed right at them. Five, ten, more than twenty missiles, began to arc up from the ground at them, thickly mixed with jammers that made an exact count all but impossible. "Scheiße!" Asuka growled. "He was saving up for us. Shinji…"

最后一波导弹和干扰器突然在屏幕上绽放，近在咫尺且直冲他们而来。五枚、十枚，超过二十枚导弹从地面向上对他们发起攻击，密集地混杂着干扰器，使得精确计数几乎不可能。"该死！"明日香咆哮道，"他一直在为我们攒着。真嗣……"

"On it…" he answered, already tensely locking on the lead missiles and firing. "I've got it… I've got it…"

“锁定它们了……”他回答道，已经紧张地瞄准了领头的导弹并开火。“我锁定它们了……我锁定它们了……”

One, two… the missiles fell. No explosions appeared to wipe out the swarm when he did manage to hit one or two of the jammers. Evidently Jinnai didn't want to make it that easy this last volley. Shinji's desperate fire picked them off one by one, but the survivors raced closer and closer.

一、二……导弹落下。尽管他设法击中了一两台干扰机，却未见爆炸将整个集群抹去。显然，这次最后一轮攻击，阵内并不打算让它那么容易。真嗣绝望地逐个击落它们，但幸存的干扰机正飞速逼近。

The last few were almost within detonation range. Asuka began to jink and swerve as much as she could, the mental link with Shinji letting her alert him to how she planned to move so it didn't disrupt his firing. The StarStrider's engine whined higher and higher as even its mighty output strained under the load she was demanding of it, maneuvering the titanic mecha at multi-Mach speeds in atmosphere and keeping its ragged shields up.

最后几架敌机几乎进入了爆炸范围。明日香开始尽可能地左右闪避，通过与真嗣的精神连接，她能及时告知自己的移动计划，以免干扰他的射击。星际飞翔者的引擎发出越来越尖锐的哀鸣，即使是它强大的输出也因她对巨型机甲进行多倍音速大气内机动并维持破损护盾的要求而感到吃力。

The last missile, lagging just behind the last two jammers, was almost on top of them. Red Whirlwind's sensors flagged it with a 'radiation' marker. 'Great… that's at least a 5 megaton fusion warhead. Jinnai must have been saving that one for something he really hated.' "Shinji…" she started to say.

最后一枚导弹，紧随最后两台干扰器之后，几乎已经逼近他们头顶。红旋风的传感器将其标记为“辐射”。太好了……这至少是一枚 500 万吨级的聚变弹头。金井肯定是为了他极度憎恶的东西才留着这一手的。"真嗣……"她刚要开口。

She could already feel his tight nod over the link. His blast speared right down it's long axis just seconds before it reached blast range of them. "I got it!" he shouted in triumph.

她已经能感受到他在链接那头的坚定点头。他的攻击沿着其长轴直射而来，仅在数秒后就会进入对他们构成威胁的爆炸范围。“我成功了！”他胜利地喊道。

Asuka grinned, sending a mental hug back at him. "Alright! Now there's nothing in our way bu-"

明日香咧嘴一笑，回赠了他一个心灵拥抱。“好嘞！现在我们面前没有任何阻碍了，只——”

The world went searing blue and pain.

世界化作炽烈的蓝色，伴随着剧痛。

"-UCK!" she distantly heard Shinji's voice. She blinked, hands suddenly fumbling for the controls that had somehow jumped out of her hands. She shook her head, trying to clear her dazzled sight.

"我靠！"她隐约听到真嗣的声音。她眨了眨眼，双手突然摸索着那些不知怎么从她手中跳脱的控制器。她摇了摇头，试图驱散眼前的一片模糊。

The screen was suddenly a blaze of damage markers and alerts.

屏幕突然间布满了损坏标记和警报。

Shinji rubbed frantically at his eyes before peering at the screaming alerts. "Shields down to 14%! What the Hell was tha-"

真嗣疯狂地揉着眼睛，然后盯着那些尖叫般的警报。“护盾降至 14%！刚才那是什么鬼——”

Another blast of blue and they were spinning, falling. Asuka grabbed for the controls blind, and threw them into a swirl of evasive maneuvers. "What the fuck was that?! That was no missile! What kind of-" Asuka suddenly blanched. "The Positron Cannon! They must have mounted it like an artillery piece and connected it to the power grid! If they patch in the S2 Organ from the other MP Eva they've got enough power to…"

又是一阵蓝光袭来，他们旋转着坠落。明日香盲目地抓住控制杆，猛地将其推入一系列规避动作中。“这他妈是什么玩意儿？！那绝不是导弹！到底是什么鬼东西——”明日香突然脸色煞白。“是正电子炮！他们一定是把它像火炮一样架设起来，并连接到了电网！如果他们从另一台量产型 EVA 那里接入 S2 机关，就有足够的能量来……”

"To wipe out our shields," Shinji finished. "They're gone. We've taken some hits on the hull, too. I've lost a couple of the emitters."

"要摧毁我们的护盾，" 真嗣总结道，"它们消失了。船体也受到了一些打击。我失去了几个发射器。"

Asuka threw them at the ground as fast as she could move them, hoping to put some terrain between them and the Eva-scale weapon, but it wasn't enough. A third blast caught them in the legs as they dove.

明日香竭尽全力将它们抛向地面，希望能借助地形与那巨型武器拉开距离，但仍嫌不够。就在他们扑倒之际，第三波攻击击中了他们的腿部。

She bit down on a scream. She tasted blood from where she bit into her cheek. She'd felt worse; the feedback systems on Roter Wirbelsturm weren't nearly as bad about transmitting pain as her Evangelion. Nothing would ever beat the pain of feeling the Mass Production Series tearing her apart, but that just meant they must have taken one nasty hit. She couldn't feel 'her' right leg anymore.

她咬紧牙关，压抑住尖叫。口中尝到了血腥味，那是她咬破脸颊的痕迹。她经历过更糟的；红色旋风上的反馈系统远不如她的福音战士那样善于传递痛苦。没有什么能比得上量产型系列将她撕裂的痛楚，但这只能说明他们一定遭受了重创。她已经感觉不到“她”的右腿了。

They dropped behind a low set of hills, finally out of the line of fire, but they were now badly off balance and out of control. Asuka could feel Shinji pulling up on the controls right along with her, but they only managed to turn their plunge earthward into a flatter trajectory. The StarStrider vibrated and groaned as they plowed into the ground at a shallow angle, gouging a huge trench for hundreds of meters across abandoned houses and a highway.

他们降落到一排低矮的山丘后，终于脱离了火力线，但此时已严重失衡，失去控制。明日香能感觉到真嗣与她同步拉起操纵杆，但仅将垂直坠落转为平缓的滑行轨迹。星际飞船在以浅角度冲入地面时剧烈震动、发出呻吟，在废弃的房屋与高速公路上犁出一条数百米长的巨大沟壑。

"Half the skin is melted from those hits, and we've lost both primary emitters," Shinji groaned. "We can still get airborne, but we're going to be a lot slower and less agile with one leg gone."

"那些攻击让皮肤融掉了一半，而且我们失去了两个主要发射器，" 真嗣呻吟道，"我们还能飞起来，但失去一条腿后，速度和灵活性都会大打折扣。"

"We're still alive to complain about it. That Positron Cannon blew a hole through a Mass Production Eva like it was made of styrofoam. Good thing the Imperial Navy builds tougher," Asuka replied. She winced as she looked at the damage displays on the screen. "We're down and close to Potsdam. I think I can keep us belo-" She broke off as three more icons appeared on the screen.

"我们还能为此抱怨，说明命大。那正电子炮一击就把量产型 EVA 打穿了，跟打穿泡沫塑料似的。幸好帝国海军造的东西更皮实。"明日香回答道。她看着屏幕上的损伤显示，不禁皱了皱眉。"我们现在迫降在波茨坦附近，我觉得能保持低空飞行——"话音未落，屏幕上又出现了三个新的图标。

Three more missiles had launched, all tagged already with 'radioactive' carrots on the display. But they weren't tracking towards them. Fifteen megatons was on its way unimpeded towards Buenos Aires.

又有三枚导弹发射了，显示屏上均已标记了“放射性”胡萝卜。然而，它们并未朝他们追踪而来。十五兆吨的毁灭力量正畅通无阻地向布宜诺斯艾利斯袭去。

Asuka snapped her eyes back to the damage display. Most of their weapons were gone. If they wanted to stop these three, they'd have to get closer. And that meant leaving their refuge.

明日香猛地将目光转回损伤显示。他们的大部分武器已经消失。如果想要阻止这三者，他们必须靠近。而这意味着要离开他们的避难所。

She locked eyes with Shinji in the comm window for a heartbeat. His stare was as firm and calm as her own. She didn't even need to say a word; she could already feel his agreement and acknowledgement over their link.

她在通讯窗口与真嗣对视了一瞬。他的目光坚定而平静，与她如出一辙。无需言语，她已能通过链接感受到他的同意与确认。

Red Whirlwind leapt skyward as fast as the damaged mecha could move, streaking for the rapidly accelerating missiles. Asuka angled them towards the nearest. A huge blade with an edge barely an electron thick snapped out of their right arm, a faint blue haze of radiation limning the edge where the atmosphere's own atoms split in its path. Asuka and Shinji sliced the first missile in half without slowing down. She felt Shinji aiming one of the remaining secondary emitters at the next missile, burning a hole through the warhead with a shot of energy that left a burning trail across half the sky behind it.

红旋风以受损机甲所能达到的最快速度一跃而起，直扑那些加速飞行的导弹。明日香操控着它们朝最近的导弹冲去。右臂中弹出一把巨刃，其锋利边缘仅有一个电子的厚度，大气中的原子在其路径上分裂，边缘泛起淡淡的蓝色辐射光晕。明日香与真嗣未减速度，一刀将首枚导弹劈成两半。她感觉到真嗣正瞄准另一枚导弹，用剩余的辅助发射器发射能量束，贯穿弹头，留下一道燃烧的轨迹，横跨半边天际。

The last missile was climbing faster and faster, beginning to outspeed them. In moments it would be out of range entirely. Asuka grit her teeth harder and pushed the engines harder. She knew all Imperial military engines were rated to not explode until at least 150% of redlining. Red Whirlwind strained a little faster as she felt Shinji join his will to hers and push.

最后一枚导弹正加速攀升，逐渐超越了他们。转眼间，它即将完全超出射程。明日香咬紧牙关，将引擎推至极限。她清楚帝国军用引擎至少能承受 150%的红线负荷而不爆炸。随着她感受到真嗣将意志与她合一并共同推动，红色旋风号略微加速，奋力追赶。

The hairs on the back of her neck prickled suddenly, and she jerked the controls to the side. The azure blaze of the Positron Cannon's fire only nicked their upper arm this time. Their luck was running low.

她颈后的毛发突然竖起，猛地向一侧拉动控制杆。这次，正电子加农炮的蓝焰仅擦伤了他们的上臂。他们的运气正逐渐耗尽。

She flicked her eyes to meet Shinji's again. He nodded, then keyed the comms, which by a small miracle were still working. "Misato-san! We're at the launch complex! But we're damaged and taking fire from the Positron Cannon they mounted in Berlin! There's one more missile on it's way to you, a big one! Five megaton fusion warhead! We might not be able to-"

她迅速将目光再次投向真嗣。他点头示意，随后操作通讯设备，幸好这设备奇迹般地仍在运作。“美里小姐！我们已抵达发射场！但我们受损严重，正遭受柏林部署的正电子加农炮的攻击！还有一枚导弹正朝你飞去，是一枚巨型导弹！五百万吨级的聚变弹头！我们可能无法……”

Asuka's dodge was too late this time. The blast of positrons caught them square in the back. Asuka felt her restraint frame catch her as the massive mecha lurched and screamed under the hit.

这次明日香的闪避太迟了。正电子的爆炸正中他们背后。明日香感觉到束缚框架在巨型机甲因受到攻击而摇晃和尖叫时紧紧抓住了她。

She desperately turned the mecha around, heading towards Potsdam and aiming towards the ground. They might not be able to stop that last missile already launched, but they might be able to reach the launch complex and stop any more. She could hear Shinji still shouting into the comms, telling Misato of their intentions. The ground was coming up at them faster than she meant it to when one more flash of eye-watering blue suddenly turned the whole world black.

她拼命将机甲转向，朝着波茨坦疾驰而去，目标直指地面。尽管他们可能无法阻止已发射的最后一枚导弹，但或许能抵达发射场，阻止更多导弹的升空。她能听到真嗣仍在通讯中大声呼喊，向美里报告他们的意图。地面以比她预期更快的速度迎面而来，就在这时，一道刺眼的蓝色闪光突然间让整个世界陷入黑暗。

She never even felt their impact at over 600 kph.

她甚至没有感受到以超过 600 公里时速撞击的冲击。

Part 78 第 78 章

Through Fire And Storm 穿越火海与风暴

Someone was shaking her. "Asuka! Asuka! Come on, wake up!"

有人在摇晃她。“明日香！明日香！快醒醒！”

"'m awake…" she mumbled. Why was her head pounding? She couldn't feel Shinji. This was unsatisfactory. Where was h-

"醒了…" 她喃喃自语。为何头如此剧痛？她感觉不到真嗣的存在。这让人不满。他在哪儿-

Memory smashed back in. Her eyes popped open. The sudden wave of pain forced her to close them again almost instantly. "Nnnng! What… Shinji? We intact?"

记忆猛然涌回。她的眼睛倏地睁开。突如其来的剧痛迫使她几乎立刻又闭上了眼睛。“嗯……什么……真嗣？我们没事吧？”

Shinji's relieved sigh was right behind her. "We are. Red Whirlwind isn't. We're down one and a half legs, most major weapon systems, and the comms. Main power and self-repair is still up, but… The repair system says it's going to take at least two hours to restore basic functionality. Are you alright? You've been out for a couple of minutes. It took me a bit to wiggle down here." Naked worry filled his voice.

真嗣松了一口气的声音就在她身后响起。“我们还好。红旋风就不行了。我们损失了一条半腿，大部分主要武器系统，还有通讯设备。主电源和自我修复功能还在，但是……修复系统显示至少需要两小时才能恢复基本功能。你没事吧？你已经昏迷了几分钟。我费了点劲才挤到这里来。”他的声音里充满了赤裸裸的担忧。

She pried her eyes open again. The pain in her head was rapidly ebbing, but she felt badly tired. "I'm… alive. We… Scheiße. No comms? Great. I hope that last call to Misato got through. And we can't sit here for two hours. We have to take out that launch base before Jinnai fries everyone." She started pulling herself free of the control frame while looking at the display in front of her. The damage indicators showed Red Whirlwind was in bad shape from the multiple Positron Cannon hits. Half the main systems read crippled or damaged. She twisted around in the narrow pilot's compartment and worked her way around until she was face to face with Shinji where he was sticking his head in from the access tunnel.

她再次勉强睁开双眼，头痛正迅速消退，但疲惫感却异常强烈。"我还……活着。我们……该死。通讯断了？真棒。希望最后给美里打的电话接通了。而且我们不能在这里干等两小时。得在神无祭把大家都干掉之前摧毁那个发射基地。"她开始从控制框架中挣脱出来，同时盯着面前的显示屏。损伤指示器显示，由于多次被阳电子炮击中，赤旋风的状态非常糟糕。半数主要系统显示为瘫痪或受损。她在狭窄的驾驶舱内扭动身体，费力地挪动，直到与从通道探头进来的真嗣面对面。

"From what I can tell from the remaining sensors, we're also buried at the bottom of a pretty good crater. We impacted pretty hard." His eyes inspected her face, a worried crease on his brow. "Are … are you sure you're alright? I… kind of panicked a bit when you went cold in the link."

从剩余传感器的信息来看，我们似乎还落入了一个相当大的陨石坑底部。撞击力度相当大。" 他的目光审视着她的脸庞，眉头紧锁，流露出担忧。"你……你确定你没事吗？当你在链接中失去意识时，我……我有点慌了。"

She waved his concern away, though she did reach out to take his hand as he wriggled backwards back out the accessway. "I'll be fine. My head feels better already. Alright, we can't get Red Whirlwind to move for two hours, we can't stay here and let Jinnai turn Buenos Aires into a molten crater, and we're both still on our feet. So we need to get moving, now."

她摆手示意他不必担心，尽管她确实伸出手握住了他的手，而他则蠕动着从通道中退了出来。“我会没事的。我的头已经感觉好多了。好吧，我们不能让红旋风两小时内动弹不得，我们不能留在这里任由金井把布宜诺斯艾利斯变成熔岩坑，而且我们俩都还能行动。所以我们现在就得动身。”

Shinji nodded. "Escape gear?"

真嗣点头道：“逃生装备？”

Asuka nodded back. She loved being in synch. "Escape gear."

明日香点头回应。她喜欢这种同步的感觉。“逃生装备。”

Emergency explosives on the access hatches quickly blew them an exit, and it was the work of only a few minutes to get the two Mobility Support Escape Defense Armor suits out of the storage compartments on Red Whirlwind's still intact lower torso, luckily still above the ground. The NILS course that had taught them the basic operation of the huge StarStrider had also included the very minimum to get the suits in action. The Navy suits were far lighter and more flexible than the Heinlein-161 suits Misato's Scouts wore, but not nearly as designed for heavy combat. They were meant to keep Navy Pilots alive and mobile on a hostile landing zone, not for frontline battle, but Asuka knew they didn't have much choice. The Avaloni suits should be practically unstoppable versus anything Jinnai could throw at them, and they had to stop the launches.

紧急爆炸装置迅速在通道舱门上炸开出口，仅用几分钟时间，便从红旋风仍完好无损的下躯干存储舱中取出两套机动支援逃生防御装甲服，幸好这部分仍悬于地面之上。NILS 课程不仅教授了他们操作巨型星际飞船的基础知识，还涵盖了启动这些装甲服的最基本技能。海军的装甲服远比美里侦察队所穿的 Heinlein-161 型轻便灵活，但并不专为重装战斗设计。其初衷是在敌对登陆区保持海军飞行员的生命力和机动性，而非前线作战。然而，明日香清楚他们别无选择。面对阵内可能派出的任何威胁，阿瓦隆装甲服应近乎无敌，他们必须阻止发射行动。

'Then again, that's what I said about Red Whirlwind,' Asuka thought to herself. 'And now we have to head into a battle without the Pilot-link. I already miss having Shinji in my head in a fight.'

然而，正如我之前对红色旋风的看法一样，明日香暗自思忖。现在我们不得不在没有飞行员链接的情况下投入战斗。我已经怀念在战斗中与真嗣心灵相通的感觉了。

She looked over at him. He was already sealing his suit up and the silver-chrome skin rippled briefly before settling into a dull green-brown-black camouflage. "Ready?" she asked him.

她朝他望去，他正封紧自己的防护服，银铬色的表面短暂地泛起波纹，随后定格成一种暗绿褐黑的迷彩。“准备好了吗？”她问道。

He nodded and hoisted the energy rifle that was the main included weapon. There had been more potent ones in another compartment of Red Whirlwind, but that side of the mecha was buried too deep to get at quickly. "I wish… You can…" He sighed and shook his head. "Let's go."

他点头并举起作为主要配备武器的能量步枪。红旋风机甲的另一隔间里本有更强大的武器，但那侧机甲埋得太深，无法迅速取出。“我真希望……你能……”他叹了口气，摇摇头，“我们走吧。”

"I am not 'staying back where it's safe', baka. You should know I feel just as strongly about you going on without me as you do about me. And don't give me any shit about 'but you're pregnant!' It's you and me to the end, together!" Asuka said firmly.

"我不是'留在安全的地方'，笨蛋。你应该知道，你对我独自前行的担忧，和我对你留下来的担忧一样强烈。别拿'但你怀孕了！'这种话来搪塞我。是你和我，一起走到最后！" 明日香坚定地说。

"I know. And I love you for it. Nothing's ever going to stop me wishing you were safe, though I know just as well that you're never going to be the sort to sit out a fight, especially when it's all our friends at risk," he replied, a little sadly. "I'm going to be right next to you the whole way. I will protect you, I promise."

我知道。为此我爱你。尽管我深知你绝非那种临阵退缩之人，尤其是在所有朋友都面临危险时，但我仍无法停止希望你平安无事。"他略带忧伤地回答，"我会一路紧随你身旁。我会保护你，我承诺。"

"Baka. I don't need protecting." The same old boast was a lot less harsh now. "Now let's finish this."

"笨蛋。我不需要保护。" 这句老话现在听起来温和了许多。"现在让我们结束这一切吧。"

She put her bulbous helmet on and sealed it, her suit's skin rippling to match his. They took off in a flash, the anti-grav maneuvering unit on each suit rocketing them away at terrifying speed as Red Whirlwind's hatches sealed up tight behind them.

她戴上圆滚滚的头盔并密封好，她的宇航服表面随之波动，与他的相匹配。他们一闪即逝，各自宇航服上的反重力机动装置以惊人的速度将他们发射出去，而红色旋风号的舱门在他们身后紧紧闭合。

Shooting over the land of her birth at 500kph had never felt so slow. She silently urged the suit faster, hating every second they'd already lost. One more missile had already taken off over their head. Or had tried to, at least. Combined fire from both their rifles had punched a hole in its side and sent the ICBM spiraling wildly off course to crash somewhere to the southwest. The launch complex would come into sight in just minutes, but she begrudged every moment.

以 500 公里时速飞越故土，从未感觉如此缓慢。她默默催促战衣加速，痛恨已流逝的每一秒。又一枚导弹从头顶发射，至少试图如此。他们双枪齐射，在导弹侧面轰出窟窿，使其失控翻滚，坠向西南某处。发射场即将映入眼帘，但她仍嫌时间流逝太慢。

'Not least because shooting down that last sucker probably gave away the fact we're not dead. In fact, we should be seeing… yup. Right on schedule.'

尤其是因为击落那最后一个家伙很可能暴露了我们并未死亡的事实。事实上，我们应该很快就会看到……没错。正好按计划来。

Her sensor display on her HUD lit up. Two airborne contacts heading their way, low altitude, slow speed. Some of Jinnai's precious helicopters, heading for Red Whirlwind's crash site, no doubt. Their closing velocity was so high they'd have to slow down to even take a shot at them. She didn't want to slow down, but she didn't want them to start poking at her crashed mecha either. Fortunately, she could do two things at once. Or rather, they could. "Shinji?"

她的头盔显示器上的传感器亮了起来。两个空中目标正朝他们飞来，低空、慢速。无疑是金井那些珍贵的直升机，正前往红色旋风坠毁地点。它们的接近速度太高，必须减速才能对他们开火。她不想减速，但也不希望他们开始检查她坠毁的机甲。幸运的是，她能同时做两件事。或者更确切地说，他们能。“真嗣？”

It was all she had to say. Even without the familiar intimacy of his thoughts in her head, she could tell he fully understood what she wanted. Take out the choppers. "Got it," he said.

她要说的就这些。即便脑海中不再有他熟悉的思绪，她也能感觉到他完全明白她的意图。取出那些牙齿。“明白了，”他说。

She could understand his reply, too. Shooting to disable. "I'll keep on, hit them before they can notice the choppers are gone. You follow on my heels."

她也能理解他的回答，射击以使对方失去战斗力。“我会继续，趁他们还没注意到直升机不见了就先发制人。你紧跟在我后面。”

"Roger." Suddenly he was gone from where he'd been hanging, right off her left side. She flashed past the helicopters well above them, a mismatched pair of a NATO UH-60 Blackhawk and a Polish Mi-17. The crews didn't even have time to know she was there before Shinji's rifle flashed twice and they began to spiral out of control, their tail rotors shot away.

"收到。"他突然从原本悬挂的位置消失，就在她左侧。她高速掠过直升机群，远在他们之上，那是一对不协调的组合——北约的 UH-60 黑鹰和波兰的 Mi-17。机组人员甚至来不及意识到她的存在，真嗣的步枪便闪烁两次，两架直升机随即开始失控旋转，尾旋翼已被击毁。

Asuka paid the attack a tiny fraction of her attention as she rapidly left it behind, watching the feed from Shinji's suit in the corner of her HUD. She didn't have long to watch. Moments later, the Potsdam launch complex was spread out below her. Her threat display immediately threw icons over AA guns, radar emplacements, command bunkers,… and missile emplacements. Not all the missiles in sight were ICBMs. Several smaller, anti-aircraft ones were already pivoting in her direction.

明日香只分出极小一部分注意力应对攻击，迅速将其甩在身后，同时从 HUD 角落监视着真治的装甲服传来的画面。她没多少时间观察，不久后，波茨坦发射场便在她下方展开。威胁显示立刻在防空炮、雷达站、指挥碉堡……以及导弹发射装置上投射出图标。并非所有导弹都是洲际弹道导弹，几枚较小的防空导弹已开始转向对准她。

She lit up one SA-19 already firing at her. It exploded nicely as she quickly dropped under another missile flashing over her. She dropped to the ground, setting her anti-grav to bounding-mode, and began 50 meter leaps around the base, hosing bunkers and missile trucks with her rifle as fast as she could ID them. She'd shattered dozens of launchers and bunkers in minutes by the time she reached a part of the complex that had been far enough from her point of entry that it was still launching.

她点燃了一枚正向她袭来的 SA-19 导弹，导弹在空中绚丽爆炸，她迅速下潜，躲过另一枚呼啸而过的导弹。落地后，她将反重力装置调至跳跃模式，开始以 50 米的跨度在基地周围跳跃，迅速识别目标并用步枪扫射碉堡和导弹车。到达远离她入口的区域时，她已摧毁了数十个发射器和碉堡，那里因距离较远，仍有导弹在发射。

One more ICBM began to take off as she leapt further into the base. She fired almost straight up at it, the fire of it's solid-fueled engines not stopping as she shattered them with her blasts, but losing the neat cone of thrust and spraying all over as she destroyed the engine bells. The missile's climb slowed, stopped, and became a slow arc right back onto the base. It landed right on top another missile truck just beginning to erect for launch.

当她纵身深入基地时，又一枚洲际弹道导弹开始升空。她几乎垂直地向其开火，导弹的固体燃料引擎在被她的冲击波击碎时并未停止燃烧，但失去了整齐的推力锥形，四处喷溅。导弹的爬升逐渐放缓、停滞，随后缓慢地划出一道弧线，径直落回基地。它精准地砸在另一辆正准备竖起发射的导弹运输车上。

The blast blew Asuka right out of the air and into a crowd of soldiers on the ground that were attempting to hand out shoulder-fired missiles. They had only seconds to gape at her before she whipped her rifle across her front and began firing. The Avaloni weapon that tore through armored vehicles with ease made short work of the men in front of her. She whirled to deal with the ones beh-

爆炸将明日香从空中直接抛向一群正在地面分发便携式导弹的士兵。他们只有几秒钟的时间目瞪口呆地看着她，随后她迅速挥动步枪横扫前方并开始射击。阿瓦隆尼武器轻易撕裂装甲车的威力，在她面前的人身上同样迅速见效。她转身应对背后的敌人——

The world went white and loud. She felt herself tumbling, dropping to the ground, the suit's system sounding some garbled warning about 'Kinetic shields offline' and 'Inertial dampeners compromised, suit integrity 63%'. The world was still spinning when she struggled to her feet, trying to figure out what had happened.

世界变得一片白亮且嘈杂。她感到自己翻滚着，摔向地面，战衣系统发出含糊不清的警告，提示“动能护盾下线”和“惯性阻尼器受损，战衣完整性 63%”。当她挣扎着站起来时，世界仍在旋转，她试图弄清楚发生了什么。

The surprised looking soldier 30 meters in front of her looked stunned she was still on her feet. He dropped away from the expended Kornet launcher on the back of the truck and dove over the far side of the vehicle when he saw her still moving and bringing her rifle around at him. She blasted the vehicle anyhow, hoping he got caught in the explosion. "Nngg… Anti-tank missiles to the head suck… Shinji, where the Hell are you?! It's starting to get a little hot here!"

前方 30 米处那位面露惊色的士兵，见她仍站立不倒，显得目瞪口呆。他迅速从卡车后部已发射的 Kornet 导弹发射器旁撤离，并在看到她仍在移动并举枪对准他时，猛地跳到车辆另一侧。她还是向车辆开火，希望他能被爆炸波及。“呃……被反坦克导弹击中头部真难受……真嗣，你到底在哪儿？！这里开始变得有点棘手了！”

"Coming! 500 meters south southeast of you!" he replied over the radio. Several explosions in that direction heralded his arrival.

"来了！在你南南东方向 500 米处！"他通过无线电回复道。那个方向接连的爆炸声预示着他的到来。

She shook her head. Only her right ear was getting any sound. The hit must have damaged her helmet more than she thought. "Hurry up! I just took a hit from an anti-tank missile, and my head's still ringing! They're starting to get their act together!"

她摇了摇头，只有右耳能听到声音。那次攻击肯定比她想象的更严重地损坏了她的头盔。“快点！我刚被反坦克导弹击中，脑袋还在嗡嗡作响！他们开始组织起来了！”

"Are you alright?!" Shinji sounded more worried than she did. "I'm coming right now!"

"你没事吧?!" 真嗣听起来比她还要担心。"我马上就来!"

"I'm fine, the suit took it! Just get here so I don't take any mo-"

我没事，战衣挡住了！快来，别让我再挨一下——

"ASUKA, BEHIND YOU!" Shinji arrived with a tackle, knocking her tumbling away as he caromed into her.

"ASUKA, 小心后面！" 真嗣一个飞扑赶到，将她撞得翻滚开去，自己也随之弹开。

The world went white and loud again, though this time she was a little more connected to what was going on. So she was aware this time of the blast throwing her rolling and tumbling further away from Shinji. She was aware when she finally came to a stop, the suit's blithely calm voice still yammering something about 'Kinetic shields overloaded', 'suit integrity something something', and 'operator alert, something imminent failure something'. She wasn't listening. She had no attention to spare for it. Because she was aware enough to recognize what she was seeing.

世界再次变得一片白光且嘈杂，但这次她与周围发生的事情有了更多的联系。因此，她意识到这次爆炸将她抛起，翻滚着远离了真嗣。当她最终停下来时，她意识到那套战衣依旧平静地喋喋不休，说着什么“动能护盾过载”、“战衣完整性如何如何”，还有“操作员注意，即将发生某种故障”。她没有在听。她无暇顾及这些。因为她足够清醒，能认出眼前所见。

The BMP-3 80 meters away must have been from some leftover USSR unit, but it had been sloppily repainted in UN markings at some point, a tiny corner of her mind noted. The majority of her mind was more occupied with the fact it was lining up a second shot at Shinji, who was just staggering upright, his hands trying desperately to cover the jagged rent in his suit that ran up the right side of his bodyohGotthe'sbleedingnononono

那辆 80 米开外的 BMP-3 想必是苏联遗留下来的某部装备，但不知何时被草率地涂上了联合国标志，她脑海的一角闪过这个念头。而她的大部分思绪则被另一件事占据——那辆战车正瞄准着刚刚挣扎站起的真嗣，他的双手拼命捂住从右侧身体延伸至衣服上的裂口，鲜血正不断涌出，不，不，不……

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

Her rifle almost came up in time. The gun on the BMP flashed, the world went white again. She felt something heavy slam into her as she squeezed the trigger on her rifle and the APC vanished in a blast of white-hot energy. Then she was flying backwards through the air with a body on top of her, lazily tumbling until they came to an abrupt halt against something green, metal, and solid enough for them to leave a big dent in. Her suit's voice was becoming broken and slurred. She wasn't listening.

她的步枪几乎及时举起。BMP 上的机枪闪烁，世界再次变得一片白茫。她感到一股沉重撞击袭来，就在她扣动步枪扳机的那一刻，装甲运兵车在炽热的白光爆炸中消失。随后，她与压在身上的身躯一同向后飞去，悠然翻滚，直到猛地撞上某片绿色、金属且足够坚实的物体，留下一个巨大的凹痕。她战衣内的声音开始断断续续，含糊不清。她已无心聆听。

Shinji's suit was more pieces than whole now, most of the torso and his right arm barely connected pieces. She couldn't tell where the blood was coming from, but it was everywhere, flowing fast. It was all over her hands… when had her suit's left arm vanished? There was no more armor below the forearm, but her hand was only slightly burned.

真嗣的装甲如今已是支离破碎，大部分躯干和右臂仅剩几处勉强相连。她无法判断血从何处涌出，只见其四处流淌，速度极快。血迹遍布她的双手……何时她的左臂装甲已不翼而飞？前臂以下再无护甲，但她的手仅轻微灼伤。

"SHINJI! Answer me, you stupid bastard! SHINJI! Talk to me!" Her hand flailed at her suit's backpack, fumbling for the armor patches and first aid pads.

"真嗣！回答我，你这蠢货！真嗣！跟我说话！" 她手忙脚乱地摸索着战斗服背包，寻找装甲补丁和急救垫。

She got a weak, "…ur s'ppsd t' c'll me 'b'ka'" in reply. It was the greatest thing she'd ever heard.

她得到的回答微弱无力：“……你该叫我‘贝卡’。”这是她听过的最棒的话。

"Stay down! You're bleeding!"

趴下！你在流血！

"I am?" Confused. "As'ka, I...I c'n stand… 'm ok…" Shinji was already trying to rise from her lap, using the rifle he somehow still had as a crutch.

"我没事？" 困惑中，"阿斯卡，我...我能站起来…我没事…" 真嗣已经在尝试从她的膝上起身，用他不知怎么还握着的步枪作为拐杖。

She wriggled out from under him and shoved him gently back down. "I said stay down, baka! Your suit's a mess and you're bleeding like crazy!"

她从他身下扭动着挣脱出来，轻轻将他推回原位。“我说了别动，笨蛋！你的衣服都乱成一团了，还流血不止！”

"Pr'tect yu…" he slurred, and shook his head. "I… what happ'n?" He was sounding more lucid, at least.

"保护你…" 他含糊地说，摇了摇头。"我… 发生了什么？" 至少，他的声音听起来更清醒了些。

She finally pulled the patches and medical pads out of the dismayingly tiny compartment, slapping them down over the worst of the wounds she could see on his right side. The patches liquefied and flowed like batter to create a meager armor seal over the gashes in his suit. She couldn't see the medical pads underneath, but knew they'd seal his wounds just as tight. As long as she could keep him alive long enough to get him back to the hospital in Buenos Aires, Hikari could save him.

她终于从那令人沮丧的小隔间里拽出了补丁和医疗垫，啪地一声贴在他右侧最严重的伤口上。补丁液化流动，如同面糊般在撕裂的防护服上形成了一层薄弱的护盾。虽然看不见下面的医疗垫，但她知道它们会同样紧密地封住他的伤口。只要能让他活着撑到返回布宜诺斯艾利斯的医院，Hikari 就能救他。

'Or the emergency stasis gear in Red Whirlwind, or or…something! You are NOT dying on me, damn it!' She grabbed the armor patches and med pads out of Shinji's still intact backpack, slapping them on the rest of his wounds. His suit was now intact-ish. The biggest holes were now patched, at least. On the downside, they were now completely out of medical and repair patches, and still in the middle of a flaming battle. She was moderately sure they'd accounted for the majority of Jinnai's remaining viable missiles by now, or at least the part that had the range to reach South America. With Shinji hurt and his suit a mess, maybe it was time to look for an exit? Oh, right, her suit was kind of chewed up too, missing an arm.

又或是红色旋风中的紧急静滞装置，又或是……别的什么！你绝不能就这样死在我面前，该死！'她从真嗣那尚且完好的背包中抓出装甲补丁和医疗垫，迅速贴在他其余的伤口上。他的战衣现在算是勉强修补好了，至少最大的破洞已被堵上。然而，坏消息是他们已耗尽了所有医疗和修复补丁，且仍身处烈焰战场之中。她大致确信，他们已消耗了神无井剩余可用的多数导弹，至少是那些射程能覆盖南美洲的部分。随着真嗣受伤，战衣破损，或许该考虑撤退了？哦，对了，她的战衣也受损严重，还缺了一条胳膊。

She spent a moment turning off all the damage and system alarms that were still beeping at her. She cursed when she got to 'anti-grav damaged, flight incapable'. Looks like the easy way out was no good. She paused, then stiffened in shock. The last alarm she'd been about to silence was the radiation warning one. It was reporting unsafe levels of radiation right… here.

她花了一会儿时间关闭了所有仍在对她发出哔哔声的损害和系统警报。当她看到“反重力装置损坏，无法飞行”时，不禁咒骂起来。看来轻松脱身是不可能了。她停顿了一下，随即震惊地僵住了。她即将关闭的最后一个警报是辐射警告。它正在报告此处辐射水平不安全。

She spun around. The large, solid object they'd hit, the thing they were still leaning against turned out to be another transporter-erector-launcher truck with a missile sitting on back. Their impact against the side had cracked the missile near the warhead. The radiation alarm's angry buzz continued, and the now somewhat fuzzy and disrupted HUD in her helmet reported their was a big, nasty fission warhead inside. "Shinji, we need to get out of here. Now. This thing's leaking radiation, and our suits are too trashed to protect us for long."

她猛地转身。他们撞上的那个庞大坚实的物体，现在仍倚靠着的，原来是一辆装载着导弹的运输起竖发射车。撞击导致导弹弹头附近出现裂纹。辐射警报的刺耳嗡鸣持续不断，而她头盔中已有些模糊和紊乱的平视显示器显示，里面藏有一个巨大的、危险的裂变弹头。“真嗣，我们必须立刻离开这里。这东西正在泄漏辐射，我们的防护服已经破损不堪，无法长时间保护我们。”

"And Jinnai's… troops are.. getting organized. There's a… bunch of APCs… and things… headed our way," Shinji panted, pain lacing his voice. He pointed weakly back the way they'd come.

“而阵内的……部队正在……组织起来。有一批……装甲运兵车……和其他东西……正朝我们这边来，”真嗣喘息着说，声音中夹杂着痛苦。他无力地指向他们来时的方向。

Much of the launch complex was now on fire, both from their direct shooting and secondary explosions. But the defenders had now had some time to react, and more and more troops were spilling out of the intact bunkers. Asuka followed Shinji's finger to the area they'd just been blown from, and there were indeed at least four or five armored vehicles starting to point weapons at them, with even more pickup trucks with improvised heavy weapon mounts in the back forming up near them.

发射场的许多区域此刻已陷入火海，既有直接射击造成的，也有二次爆炸引发的。但防御者们已有时间作出反应，越来越多的士兵从完好的掩体中涌出。明日香顺着真嗣手指的方向望去，他们刚刚逃离的那片区域，确实有四五辆装甲车开始将武器对准他们，周围还有更多载有临时重型武器支架的皮卡车正在集结。

"Well, I can't fly anymore, so we may have to figure out another way out," Asuka said grimly. She raised her rifle and began blasting the APCs from where they stood. Several exploded nicely.

"好吧，我现在飞不了了，我们得另想办法逃出去。" 明日香冷冷地说道。她举起手中的步枪，开始从站立的位置向那些装甲运兵车开火。几辆装甲车应声爆炸，场面颇为壮观。

"My anti-grav… is dead too," Shinji said. "I… my rifle… still works, I think."

“我的反重力装置…也坏了，”真嗣说道，“我…我的步枪…应该还能用。”

She spared him one worried glance. "Tell me you're still able to move."

她忧心忡忡地看了他一眼，“告诉我你还能动。”

He nodded jerkily. "Just… hurts to breathe. Ribs on fire. Dizzy, too…"

他生硬地点了点头。“只是……呼吸都疼。肋骨像火烧一样。还头晕……”

"No dying. You promised. And it is way too fucking cliché for you to die right after I told you…," she had to swallow against a suddenly tight throat, "I love you, you know?"

“不许死。你答应过的。而且你刚听我说完……”她不得不咽了咽口水，因为喉咙突然发紧，“我爱你，你知道的吧？”

He gave her a weak grin, but she could see he was sweating in pain and shock even through the cracked faceplate of his helmet. "Too cliché, yeah." He looked around. "Is there anything we can hijack as a ride here?"

他朝她无力地咧嘴一笑，但她透过他头盔上裂开的面罩，仍能看见他因痛苦和震惊而冒出的汗水。“太老套了，是吧。”他环顾四周，“这里有什么能让我们劫持作为交通工具的吗？”

"Just this missile truck with the leaking fission warhead. Speaking of which, we're leaving the area right now." She grabbed his hand in her bare left and tried to bound again. The best the damaged suit could manage hauling the both of them was little more than ten meter leaps, but she'd take it.

就这辆载着泄漏裂变弹头的导弹车。说起来，我们正要离开这片区域。她用裸露的左手抓住他的手，试图再次跳跃。受损的防护服拖着两人，最多只能勉强跳出十米左右，但她已经很满足了。

It was almost in time. Just seconds after they'd bounded away from the damaged missile truck, a volley of anti-tank missiles and 100mm shells began pounding where they'd just stood. Asuka's eyes widened and she tried to move them faster. "Those idiots! They're shooting at that missi-"

几乎及时。就在他们从受损的导弹卡车旁跳开几秒后，一连串反坦克导弹和 100 毫米炮弹开始猛烈轰击他们刚才站立的地方。明日香瞪大了眼睛，试图让他们移动得更快。“那些白痴！他们在朝那枚导弹开火——”

The explosion threw them flying again. She lost her grip on Shinji's hand immediately, the two of them being flung like pebbles. They were much closer to this blast than any of the others, and their suits were far less able to protect them now.

爆炸再次将他们抛飞。她立刻失去了对真嗣手的抓握，两人如同石子般被甩出。这次他们离爆炸点比以往任何一次都要近，而他们的防护服此刻也远不足以保护他们。

Asuka slammed hard into something concrete, her head smacking painfully into the wall despite her helmet. The suit's voice mumbled some final warnings and then died mid sentence. Her rifle was gone, tossed somewhere in the fall. It didn't matter. Rifles were replaceable. She struggled to her feet, the now dead suit heavier around her. "Shinji! Where are you?!"

明日香猛地撞上了坚硬的物体，尽管戴着头盔，头部还是痛楚地撞到了墙壁。装甲服的声音嘟囔着最后的警告，随后在半句话中戛然而止。她的步枪不见了，可能在跌落中被甩到了某个地方。这无关紧要，步枪可以替换。她挣扎着站起来，此刻已失效的装甲服让她感到更加沉重。“真嗣！你在哪儿？！”

"Cтоять, блядь!" an angry voice shouted from behind her.

"站住，妈的！"一个愤怒的声音从她身后喊道。

Asuka spun in place, the suit's combat knife snapping into her hand from the holdout slot under her right wrist. Two bullets sparked and ricocheted off her armor as she flung the knife in the direction of the voice without even looking, converting her spin into a dive and roll forward. A brief scream ending in a wet noise told her the blind throw had been successful. She still scrambled for cover as she came out of the roll.

明日香原地旋转，战斗服的格斗刀从右腕下的隐藏槽中弹出，稳稳落入她手中。两发子弹击中她的装甲，火花四溅后弹飞，她未曾回头，便将刀朝声音来源处掷去，同时借旋转之势向前翻滚。一声短促的惨叫戛然而止，伴随着湿润的声响，昭示着她盲掷的成功。即便如此，她仍迅速寻找掩体，从翻滚中起身。

Her knife stood out from the chest of the uniformed guard who had come up behind her. She darted forward to recover her knife and pick up his dropped AKM. But more angry voices in a mix of Russian and more tongues told her she'd been spotted.

她的刀子从身着制服的警卫胸前突出，那人是从她背后悄悄靠近的。她迅速前冲，夺回自己的刀，并捡起他掉落的 AKM 步枪。然而，更多愤怒的声音混杂着俄语和其他语言，告诉她自己已被发现。

She ducked behind a wrecked truck and risked a look over the top. There were still some trucks with weapons moving around, and more men starting to head right in her direction.

她躲到一辆毁坏的卡车后面，冒险探头观察。仍有几辆载着武器的卡车在移动，还有更多的人开始径直朝她这边走来。

'Scheiße… My suit is dead, I've lost my weapon, I'm surrounded, and it looks like I'm going to have to outdo Rambo to get out of here alive. I could really use another of your well-timed rescues right now, Shinji. You better not be dead. Please don't be dead. Please please please…'

该死……我的战衣报废了，武器也丢了，四面楚歌，看来要想活着离开，我得比兰博还兰博。真希望你能再来一次及时救援，真嗣。你可千万别死了。求你别死。求求你，求求你……

She took off running, trying to head in the general direction of 'away from the soldiers heading at me' and 'kind of the way the blast threw us' in the hopes of finding Shinji. 'Because I am not leaving here without you next to me, alive,baka! You promised! And you don't break a promise! I love you, you fucking idiot! You can't die today! You-'

她拔腿就跑，试图朝着“远离朝我逼近的士兵”和“大致是爆炸把我们抛出的方向”前进，希望能找到真嗣。因为我不会丢下你独自离开，要活生生地在我身边，笨蛋！你承诺过的！承诺不可违背！我爱你，你这个该死的傻瓜！你今天绝不能死！你——

Fire. 火。

Sound. 声音。

Pain. 痛苦。

Falling. 坠落。

Landing? 降落？

Rolling. 滚动。

Her arm didn't work. He head hurt. Everything was red. Why was it red? Oh, that was the blood. There was her arm. It was just trapped under her face. She wiped away the blood on her face. Everything was less red now. Wait… what had happened to her faceplate? It was there a minute ago. Like Shinji. Wait… where was Shinji? It was important. She tried to think, but the floor kept spinning and bouncing.

她的手臂动不了。头很痛。四周一片红色。为什么是红色？哦，那是血。她的手臂就在那里，只是被脸压住了。她擦去脸上的血迹，周围的红淡了些。等等……她的面罩呢？刚才还在的。就像真嗣一样。等等……真嗣在哪儿？这很重要。她试图思考，但地面不断旋转和跳动。

A boot to her side was partly blunted by the remains of her armor, but was still enough to roll her onto her back. She had barely a second to muzzily contemplate asking the soldier who'd kicked her if he knew where Shinji was before the smashing of a rifle butt to her face completed her journey into oblivion.

她侧身被一脚踢中，幸有残破盔甲缓冲，力道减弱，却仍足以让她翻滚至仰面朝天。她昏沉间刚想询问那踢她的士兵是否知晓真嗣下落，不料枪托猛击面门，瞬间将她彻底打入昏迷深渊。

### Chapter 41 In Blood And Screaming

The bed shook and rattled. He hurt. The pillow was cold, metallic, and smelled like mud and wet garbage. The vibration and engine noise were uncomfortable too.

床铺摇晃作响，他感到疼痛。枕头冰冷，带着金属质感，散发着泥土和湿垃圾的气味。震动和引擎噪音也令人不适。

Shinji didn't like this. 真嗣不喜欢这样。

He hurt. A lot. Why?

他很痛。非常痛。为什么？

There was blood in his mouth. He felt cold, and incredibly, terribly thirsty. Water?

他嘴里满是血腥味。他感到寒冷，而且出奇地、极度地口渴。水？

His attempt at vocalizing this was a rusty croak too soft for even his own ears to pick up. No one listened.

他试图发声，却只发出了一声沙哑的低吟，连他自己都难以听见。无人倾听。

He rolled onto his back and managed to pry his eyelids open a slit. The sky slid past sideways and grey, too fast.

他翻身仰卧，勉强撑开眼皮，露出一道缝隙。天空灰蒙蒙地斜掠而过，速度快得异常。

Someone mumbled something above him. It sounded like a question. It wasn't Japanese or English.

有人在他上方嘟囔着什么，听起来像是个问题。既不是日语，也不是英语。

Another voice answered it. Someone painfully grabbed his wrists behind him and tied them together hard and tight.

另一个声音回应着。有人在他身后吃力地抓住他的手腕，紧紧地将它们绑在一起。

Asuka. The thought struck him slowly, muddily. Nothing was clear. But this felt... important. Urgent. Where was Asuka?

明日香。这个念头缓缓地、模糊地击中了他。一切都不清晰。但这感觉……很重要。迫切。明日香在哪里？

He tried to roll onto his side and look around. But the motion was met with a boot to his side and a new flare of pain across his whole torso, so he flopped back awkwardly back the way he was.

他试图翻身环顾四周，但动作刚起，便被一脚踹在腰侧，剧痛如火舌般席卷整个胸膛，只得尴尬地倒回原位。

The sky flashed away and turned into concrete as the bed dipped downward. They dropped down, down, down into the concrete tunnel. The ceiling was cracked and chipped, with the occasional bullet mark or blast burn. It was unfamiliar... wasn't it? Wait, no... he'd been here before. The last time he'd seen it, Asuka had been bleeding. That was bad.

天空瞬间消逝，化为混凝土，床铺向下沉陷。他们一路下坠，深入混凝土隧道之中。天花板裂痕斑斑，偶有弹痕或爆炸灼烧的痕迹。这是陌生的地方……不是吗？等等，不……他曾来过这里。上次目睹此景，是明日香受伤流血之时。那可不妙。

This was NERV-Berlin. 这里是 NERV 柏林分部。

The bed stopped moving and the engine stopped rumbling. Rough hands yanked him up and mostly upright. He was surrounded by large, angry-looking men in tactical gear. They dragged him out of the back of the rusty gun-truck that apparently wasn't a bed after all, and hustled him out of the vehicle bay and up a flight of stairs.

床停止了移动，引擎的轰鸣声也戛然而止。一双粗糙的手猛地将他拽起，让他勉强站直。他发现自己被一群身穿战术装备、面露怒色的大汉团团围住。他们将他从那辆显然并非床铺的锈迹斑斑的武装卡车后部拖出，急匆匆地穿过车辆舱，登上了一段楼梯。

"Asuka?" he managed to barely croak. his throat felt drier than sand, and he was so, so tired. Just keeping his thoughts in a line for more than ten sec-

"明日香？" 他勉强挤出声音，喉咙干得像沙子一样，而且他感到无比疲惫。仅仅是让思绪维持十秒以上的连贯——

One of the men dragging him along punched him in the face and shouted at him in... wait, that was German. He knew German, right?

拖着他走的人中有一个朝他脸上打了一拳，并用……等等，那是德语。他懂德语，对吧？

"Stop babbling, you stupid shit!" the guard shouted at him. That wasn't very nice. Wait, what was going on?

"别瞎扯了，你个蠢货！"守卫冲他吼道。这话可真不中听。等等，这是怎么回事？

"You punched me," Shinji slurred.

"你打了我，" 真嗣含糊地说。

The guard punched him again before the two men dragging him shoved open the double doors at the end of the corridor they'd been taking and ushered him out into a huge, familiar room.

警卫再次对他拳打脚踢，随后那两名拖着他的人猛地推开了走廊尽头的那对双开门，将他带入了一个巨大而熟悉的房间。

NERV-Berlin's Operations Center.

NERV 柏林作战中心。

Jinnai was waiting for them in the center of the ops floor, the glow of the huge screens making his elaborately trimmed uniform look rather rumpled. It matched the snarling fury disturbing his face. "You," he snarled at Shinji. "Good. Covered in blood and beaten. That's a fine start."

阵内正在指挥中心的地板中央等待他们，巨大的屏幕光芒让他的精心修剪的制服显得有些皱巴巴。这与他脸上因愤怒而扭曲的表情相得益彰。“你，”他对着真嗣咆哮道，“很好。浑身是血，被打得狼狈不堪。真是个不错的开始。”

Shinji looked down at himself. Blood? Oh... right. He was covered in blood, large patches of his skin visible through the tattered remnants of his pilot's suit. Whatever was left of his MOSPEDA armor was long gone. He couldn't tell where the blood was coming from, though. He hurt all over.

真嗣低头看向自己。血？哦……对。他浑身是血，大片的皮肤透过破烂不堪的驾驶员服显露出来。他那套 MOSPEDA 装甲的残余早已不见踪影。他甚至分不清血是从哪里流出来的，只觉得全身都在痛。

Jinnai waved his hand at a rickety wooden chair behind him, oddly out of place in the slightly-run-down techno look of the Ops Center. "Put him next to her."

金井挥手示意身后那把摇摇欲坠的木椅，它在这略显破旧的科技风格指挥中心里显得格格不入。“把他放在她旁边。”

Asuka! 明日香！

She was slumped over in the next chair, her face hidden by her hair, which was also thickly matted with blood and dirt. She wasn't moving.

她瘫坐在旁边的椅子上，脸被头发遮住，而那头发也因血迹和污垢而变得浓密而杂乱。她一动不动。

"Asuka?" he croaked as the guards shoved him into the slightly dilapidated folding chair next to Asuka and roughly tied his bound wrists to the back. He was barely audible. His throat was so dry, and he couldn't think!

"明日香？"他嘶哑地问道，卫兵们将他推到明日香旁边的略显破旧的折叠椅上，粗暴地将他捆绑的手腕绑在椅背上。他的声音几乎听不见。他的喉咙干得要命，思绪也一片混乱！

A slap from Jinnai wrenched his focus back to the furious UN Secretary-General. "And since this bitch isn't answering questions very well right now, you get to supply some answers in her place. Start talking, you sniveling little shit! Where did you get that giant fucking robot?! That thing is twice the size of an Evangelion, and can fly? At multi-Mach speeds? Where did they build it? How did you make contact with them? How long has this plot been going on?"

金井的一记耳光将他的注意力猛地拉回到愤怒的联合国秘书长身上。“既然这个贱人现在回答问题不怎么样，你就得替她回答一些。快说，你这卑鄙小人！那个巨大的机器人是从哪儿弄来的？那玩意儿比福音战士大一倍，还能以多倍音速飞行？他们在哪儿造的？你是怎么和他们联系上的？这个阴谋已经进行了多久？”

Each question was punctuated with another smack to Shinji's face. It was not helping him think straight. Thirst was driving him crazy, and all he could think about in between slaps was Asuka. She wasn't moving! "Asuka? 'Z she okay?" he got out.

每个问题都伴随着对真嗣脸颊的又一记耳光，这让他无法清晰思考。口渴让他几近疯狂，在耳光间隙，他满脑子都是明日香。她一动不动！“明日香？她还好吗？”他勉强挤出这句话。

Jinnai grabbed his hair and yanked Shinji's head back from its slump so his eye were aimed right at Jinnai's face. "Listen to me, Ikari. Have I got your attention? Your little whore is right here, and unless you start talking, I'm going to cut bits off her while you watch."

阵内猛地抓住他的头发，将真嗣耷拉的脑袋向后一扯，迫使他的眼睛直视自己的脸。“听着，碇，我吸引到你的注意了吗？你的小贱人就在这儿，除非你开始说话，否则我会当着你的面一点点割下她的肉。”

Shinji croaked something that might have been words at him. The only one that came close to coherent was "Water."

真嗣沙哑地嘟囔了几句，听起来像是话语，唯一能勉强辨认出的是“水”。

Jinnai snarled at him and said something to one of the guards. Shinji felt himself being tipped forward.

阵内对他咆哮着，向其中一个守卫说了些什么。真嗣感到自己被向前推去。

"You want water, Ikari? Fine. Have some!"

你要水吗，碇？好啊，给你来点！

Shinji peeled his eyes back open just in time to see his face being lowered into a bucket of water. It washed over him as his head was stuffed in chin-deep.

真嗣勉强睁开眼睛，正好看见自己的脸被按进一桶水中。随着头被塞入，水没过下巴，将他彻底淹没。

He could practically feel his skin drinking it in. It invaded his mouth, his nose, his throat, his lungs. He could feel the tissues soaking it up, practically gulping it down as fast as it poured in.

他几乎能感觉到自己的皮肤在吸收它。它侵入了他的口腔、鼻腔、喉咙、肺部。他能感受到组织在吸收它，几乎像是在它涌入时大口吞咽。

His head started to clear, like magic. It began to occur to him he should probably be panicking or struggling from the firm hand holding his head under water, but instead he just swallowed, swallowed, swallowed. The water level in the bucket dropped farther and farther, until he couldn't reach any more with his mouth. He settled down to labored breathing, the water that had flowed into his lungs somehow trickling away.

他的头脑开始清醒，仿佛施了魔法。他意识到自己或许应该因那只将他头部牢牢按在水下的手而恐慌或挣扎，然而他只是不断地吞咽，吞咽，吞咽。水桶中的水位不断下降，直到他的嘴再也触碰不到。他开始艰难地呼吸，流入肺中的水不知怎的竟悄然流走。

"Uh….sir?" the guard holding his head down finally said. "He… drank it?"

"呃……先生？" 那名低头不语的守卫终于开口了，"他……喝下去了？"

"What?!" "什么?!"

Shinji felt his head being yanked out of the bucket. Jinnai seemed even more irritated than before. No, wait, not irritated. Homicidal.

真嗣感到自己的头被从水桶中猛地拽了出来。阵内看起来比之前更加恼怒。不，等等，不是恼怒。是杀意。

His brain finally in gear again somehow, Shinji felt his fear swiftly rising. Terrifying awareness that he and Asuka were in the hands of a man who personally hated them and was barely able to restrain a vicious temper at the best of times, and that these were far from such, pressed in. And he was wounded, bleeding, tied to a chair, and surrounded by armed guards. Not good.

他的大脑终于不知怎么地重新运转起来，真嗣感到恐惧迅速攀升。意识到他和明日香正落入一个对他们怀有私仇、平时就难以抑制暴烈脾气的人手中，而此刻情况远非最佳，这种恐惧感压迫着他。而且他受伤了，流着血，被绑在椅子上，周围是全副武装的守卫。情况不妙。

Jinnai took the bucket from the guard and hit Shinji in the side of the head with it, the remaining water splashing onto the floor. "You think you're being funny, Ikari? I'm not laughing. I told you: Talk, or the little slut here is going to be next." He handed the bucket to the guard again. "Fill it higher. We're going to hold her head under next, and see if the comedian here likes that better."

金井从守卫手中接过水桶，猛地朝真嗣的头部侧面砸去，剩余的水溅洒在地。“你觉得这很有趣吗，碇？我可没笑。我告诉过你：要么说，要么这小贱人就是下一个。”他又将水桶递回给守卫，“装满点。接下来我们要把她的头按进水里，看看这位喜剧演员是否更喜欢那样。”

"Don't hurt her!" Shinji burst out.

"别伤害她！" 真嗣突然喊道。

Jinnai stabbed a finger in his face. "You'd better start talking, then! Who is behind all this, Ikari?! You two shits don't have the brains or skills to put this together, and I'd have known about it long before this if you were anyone important in this plot! So who is this? Some NERV or SEELE faction in Argentina?! You two sure as Hell didn't build that giant robot yourselves!"

金井指着他的脸，厉声质问：“那你最好开始交代，碇！这一切背后是谁？你们两个废物既没脑子也没本事策划这一切，如果你们在这场阴谋中真有什么重要角色，我早就知道了！所以是谁？是 NERV 还是 SEELE 在阿根廷的分支？你们俩绝对不可能自己造出那台巨型机器人！”

"I….we…" Shinji halted. 'We got it as a present from a space-god-emperor who appeared in our tent two months ago' did not sound like something Jinnai would accept as the truth.

"我…我们…" 真嗣停顿了。'这是两个月前出现在我们帐篷里的太空神皇帝送的礼物'，这话听起来不像金井会接受为真相。

Jinnai waited a moment, but took Shinji's confused pause as defiance. "No? Fine. Rostov? Dunk her. And don't let her up until I say so."

阵内等了一会儿，却将真嗣的困惑停顿误解为反抗。“不？好吧。罗斯托夫？把她按下去。我没说放，就不许她上来。”

Shinji's heart seized in his chest as the black-clad guard put the tall bucket on a crate in front of Asuka, grabbed her unconscious form, and stuffed her head into the water, holding her down with one large hand on the back of her head, one on her body.

真嗣的心脏猛地一紧，只见那身着黑衣的守卫将高高的水桶放在明日香面前的木箱上，抓起她失去意识的身体，将她的头塞进水中，一只大手按住她的后脑，另一只手压在她身上。

The immersion seemed to awaken Asuka from her state. Just a few seconds after she went under, she began to thrash and twist against her bound hands and the guard's restraining her. Jinnai's sneer was coldly amused.

沉浸似乎唤醒了明日香的状态。就在她下水几秒后，她开始挣扎扭动，试图挣脱绑住双手的束缚和守卫的压制。神无木的冷笑中带着一丝戏谑。

"Well, well, look who's up! Maybe she'll feel like talking," he said cheerily. "Then again, maybe I'll just leave her like that until you feel like being more forthcoming, mmm?" He looked at Shinji, waiting.

“哎呀，瞧瞧谁醒了！或许她愿意聊聊天，”他兴高采烈地说。“不过，也可能我就让她那样待着，直到你愿意更加坦白，嗯？”他看着真嗣，等待着。

"P-pull her out! I'll tell you! You… you just won't believe me!" Shinji pleaded.

"拉她出来！我会告诉你！你…你只是不会相信我！" 真嗣恳求道。

Jinnai's sneer vanished, and look he gave Shinji was as cold and composed as the day they'd met. "Try me. Quickly. I'm a little low on patience today, Mister Ikari." He raised his arm again, this time aimed at Asuka. The gun in his hand glittered coldly in the still flashing warning graphics on the big screen. "You might say I'm on a hair trigger."

阵内冷笑消失，他投向真嗣的眼神冷若冰霜，一如初见之日。“试试看。快点。我今天耐心有限，碇先生。”他再次举起手臂，这次对准了明日香。手中的枪在巨幕上闪烁的警告图形映衬下，闪着寒光。“你或许可以说，我正处于一触即发的状态。”

Shinji felt his throat tighten. "Let her breathe! I'll tell you!"

真嗣感到喉咙一紧。“让她呼吸！我会告诉你的！”

Jinnai just stared at him for another moment before irritably flicking his gun aside and nodding to the guard. The expressionless grunt released Asuka's head, and she reared up and back, gasping.

阵内只是又盯着他看了一会儿，然后不耐烦地挥手示意守卫，将枪撇到一边。那个面无表情的守卫随即松开了明日香的头，她猛地挺直身子，急促地喘息着。

Mud and blood ran down her face as she coughed hard enough to turn her face red. She managed to turn her head before she vomited all over the floor next to her.

泥浆与血水顺着她的脸颊流淌，她剧烈咳嗽到面色通红。在呕吐物喷洒到身旁地板之前，她勉强扭过了头。

Shinji didn't care. She was alive, and therefore beautiful.

真嗣不在乎。她还活着，因此美丽。

"A… a man appeared in our tent just before we sailed from Marseilles," Shinji said slowly. "A portal to… He said he was from another world; the Empire of Avalon. He offered us help in rebuilding this one. He gave us that mecha, a couple others, and some soldiers to handle South America. We knocked out the warlords in Buenos Aires and the area over the last two months so we'd have a base to stop your fleet, then… I don't know, negotiate something to stop the fighting. We were kind of improvising. Using the mecha to neutralize your fleet was supposed to… to take away your strike arm." He lifted his head to see what his surrender had gained.

"在……在我们从马赛启航前不久，一个男子出现在我们的帐篷里，" 慎二缓缓说道，"他说他来自另一个世界，阿瓦隆帝国。他提出帮助我们重建这个世界。他给了我们那台机甲，还有其他几台，以及一些士兵来处理南美洲的事务。过去两个月里，我们用这些力量在布宜诺斯艾利斯及其周边地区击败了军阀，以便建立一个基地来阻止你的舰队，然后……我也不知道，试图通过谈判来停止战斗。我们基本上是在即兴发挥。使用机甲来中立化你的舰队，本意是……是要削弱你的攻击力。" 他抬起头，想看看自己的投降换来了什么。

Jinnai stared at him. "You… you expect me to believe a magic man appeared to you out of a portal and just gave you that thing?" He raised the gun again. "More of them? Soldiers? What kind of idiot do you think I am, Ikari?"

金井盯着他。“你……你指望我相信一个魔法师从传送门里冒出来，就这么把那东西给了你？”他再次举起枪。“还有更多？士兵？你当我是什么傻瓜，碇？”

"Told you he'd never believe it, Shinji. Should have tried bullshitting about a secret NERV base on the moon or something," a new voice said hoarsely.

"告诉你了，真嗣，他绝不会相信的。早知道就该瞎扯个关于月球上秘密 NERV 基地之类的。"一个新声音沙哑地说道。

Both of them snapped their faces to the side. Asuka gave Shinji a haggard smile through the filthy curtain of her hair. "By the way, I'm really glad you're not dead, Shinji. I was…" She faltered, her voice rough. "Kind of… worried for a bit. You promised not to, you know."

两人同时将脸转向一侧。明日香透过脏乱的发丝，向真嗣露出了一个憔悴的微笑。“对了，真嗣，你没死，我真的很高兴。我之前……”她声音沙哑，欲言又止，“有那么一会儿……挺担心的。你答应过我的，记得吗。”

She tilted her head to glare painfully at Jinnai "And he's not going to listen. We crashed eighty meters of screaming red evidence on him and he still can't accept what's happened."

她侧过头，痛苦地瞪着阵内，“而他不会听的。我们用八十米的尖叫红证据砸向他，他仍然无法接受所发生的事。”

Jinnai narrowed his eyes at her. "Oh, I'm sorry, Miss 'I'm so fucking smart'. You're right. I should just accept any line of bullshit this moron tries to sell me about people who come from other worlds to randomly hand out flying mecha to idiots like him and sluts like you. You want to sell me a bridge next?"

金奈眯起眼睛看着她。“哦，对不起，自称聪明绝顶的小姐。你说的对。我应该接受这个蠢货关于来自其他世界的人随意分发飞行机甲给像他这样的白痴和像你这样的荡妇的胡言乱语。接下来你是不是要卖给我一座桥？”

"He's telling the truth, you jackass. You think we imagined up that mecha? Hell, we're sitting right here! You sent us to Buenos Aires on a ship! We didn't fly back on the wings of imagination!" Asuka shot back.

他说的是实话，你这蠢货。你以为我们凭空想象出了那台机甲吗？见鬼，我们人就在这儿！是你派我们乘船去的布宜诺斯艾利斯！我们可不是靠想象飞回来的！" 明日香反驳道。

"I can see that, you stupid whore! I blew you two out of the air with nukes and a positron cannon we took from a dead Mass Production Eva. So I think a secret NERV base or SEELE hideaway project or even some American black program is a little more likely than this fairytale!" Jinnai snapped back. "So start telling me who was behind this! Buenos Aires is a molten crater by now!"

我能看出来，你这愚蠢的婊子！我用从一架死去的量产型 EVA 那里夺来的核武器和正电子炮把你们俩从空中轰了下来。所以，比起这个童话故事，我觉得一个 NERV 的秘密基地、SEELE 的藏身项目，甚至是某个美国黑计划的可能性更大！”阵内反驳道，“所以赶紧告诉我，这背后是谁在操控！布宜诺斯艾利斯现在恐怕已经变成熔岩坑了！

Shinji felt his blood run cold. 'That...that can't be true. We got most of the missiles, and TJ and… and Unit-01 will have stopped the rest, right? Wait… how long were we out? TJ's limit has got to be… can Unit-01 still run without him helping?'

真嗣感到一股寒意窜上脊背。“那...那不可能。我们已经拦截了大部分导弹，而且 TJ 和…和零号机应该已经阻止了剩下的，对吧？等等…我们昏迷了多久？TJ 的极限肯定是…零号机还能在没有他协助的情况下运行吗？”

"You little shits may have cost me nearly all of my ready ICBMs, but more than enough got through to guarantee it's a smoking hole in the ground." Jinnai's sneer returned. "So whatever you think you're protecting there, it's gone. What I want to know it who was behind this, and if there's any more giant flying robots about to appear out of nowhere."

你们这些小混蛋差点耗尽了我几乎所有的现成洲际弹道导弹，但足够多的还是成功发射了，足以确保那里变成一片焦土。”金奈的冷笑再次浮现。“所以无论你们自以为在那里保护着什么，都已经化为乌有。我真正想知道的是，这一切背后是谁在操控，以及是否还有更多巨型飞行机器人会突然冒出来。

"Oh, two or three," Asuka said sarcastically. Shinji could read the same sort of fear for the fate of their friends behind her words, though. "And we shot down most of those missiles on the way here."

"哦，两三枚吧，"明日香讽刺地说。但真嗣能从她的话语中读出对朋友们命运同样的担忧。"而且我们来这里的路上已经击落了大部分导弹。"

"And we kept shooting well after you two idiots were down and done." Jinnai shot right back. "It's been more than half an hour since the last launch, so even that one has impacted by now. And that's not even counting the warheads my sub put on target as well."

"你俩傻瓜倒下后，我们还继续射击了好一阵子。" 金井立刻反驳道，"距离上次发射已过去半个多小时，那枚导弹现在肯定也命中目标了。这还没算上我的潜艇发射的那些弹头呢。"

"Betcha that sub's gone awful quiet since you last talked," Asuka snarled. She rocked the creaky wooden chair side to side with her struggles against her own tied hands.

"敢打赌，自从你上次说话后，那潜艇就变得异常安静了，"明日香咆哮道。她挣扎着，用被绑住的双手摇晃着嘎吱作响的木椅。

Jinnai's practiced poker face betrayed nothing. One of the guards behind him was not as good, darting a worried look at the main screens behind Shinji and Asuka.

阵内熟练的扑克脸没有透露任何信息。他身后的一名警卫就没那么老练了，向真嗣和明日香背后的主屏幕投去了担忧的一瞥。

"I'd bet you're wrong. And I'm the house," Jinna replied without missing a beat. He leveled his gun at Shinji, but kept his stare on Asuka. "I always win. Now, since you're feeling talkative, you get to tell me what I want to know, or I start shooting bits off your little boyfriend here." His snarl of the last label was vicious.

"我敢打赌你错了。而我，是庄家，"金娜毫不犹豫地回答道。他将枪口对准了真嗣，但目光却紧盯着明日香。"我总是赢家。既然你现在愿意开口，那就告诉我我想知道的，否则我就开始从这个小男友身上卸零件了。"他最后那个称呼的咆哮充满了恶意。

"Bigger bits than yours," Asuka muttered, glaring.

"比你大块头多了，"明日香嘟囔着，瞪了一眼。

Shinji's blanched. "Asuka, don't-"

真嗣脸色煞白。“明日香，别——”

Jinnai's fist was faster. Asuka's head snapped back and her chair rocked.

阵内的拳头更快。飞鸟的头猛地后仰，椅子也随之摇晃。

Asuka spat some blood on the floor. "And your left is still weak," she croaked.

明日香往地上吐了口血，嘶哑地说：“你的左手还是那么无力。”

"You want some of my right?!" Jinnai shouted at her, pressing the barrel of his pistol to her forehead.

"你也想要我这份是吧?!" 金奈朝她吼道，将手枪的枪口紧贴在她额头上。

"Don't!" Shinji cried. "别！" 真嗣喊道。

Jinnai's furious stare snapped to him. "Then you'd better start telling me what I want to know, Ikari! I wiped out Buenos Aires and the entire fleet you seized already today. I'm not going to blink at adding two more to the pile. I only need one of you to talk. Where the Hell did you get that giant red thing?!"

阵内愤怒的目光猛地转向他。“那你最好开始告诉我我想知道的事情，碇！我今天已经摧毁了布宜诺斯艾利斯和你夺取的整个舰队。我不介意再多加两个。我只需要你们中的一个开口。你们到底是从哪里弄到那个巨大的红色东西的？！”

"I already told you!" Shinji protested. "He just appeared and offered to help us! He gave us everything!"

"我早就告诉过你了！" 真嗣抗议道，"他就是突然出现，主动提出要帮助我们！他给了我们一切！"

"Where's his base, Ikari?" Jinnai pressed. "If you say 'Buenos Aires', I'm going to do something violent, since I don't believe in such easy coincidences."

"他的基地在哪儿，碇？"神无井追问道，"如果你说是'布宜诺斯艾利斯'，我可要采取点暴力手段了，因为我可不信这种巧合会这么容易。"

Shinji threw a desperate look at Asuka.

真嗣绝望地望向明日香。

She shrugged. "He's not going to believe the truth, Shinji. We need to come up with some nice story that he'll accept."

她耸了耸肩。“他不会相信真相的，真嗣。我们需要编一个他愿意接受的好故事。”

Shinji's left foot exploded in pain. He didn't even hear the shot. He did hear Asuka's angry screaming at Jinnai, once his ears stopped ringing.

真嗣的左脚突然剧痛炸裂，他甚至没听见枪声。当耳鸣消退后，他听到了明日香对阵内的愤怒尖叫。

"-ou son of a bitch! Hey! HEY! Look at me! Look at me you asshole! Don't you dare touch him again or-" she was raging.

"你个混蛋！嘿！嘿！看着我！看着我，你这混蛋！你要是再敢碰他一下，我就——" 她怒不可遏。

"Or what, Soryu? What are you going to do?" Jinnai sneered. "You and your pathetic boytoy are prisoners. Your mecha is a crashed wreck that my men are about to seize, your base is a glowing crater, and there is no one coming to save you! I don't want 'stories'! I want to know where you got that thing! So talk!"

"还是怎样，Soryu？你想做什么？" Jinnai 嘲讽道，"你和你的可怜小男友都是囚犯。你的机甲已是一堆坠毁的残骸，正等着我的人去夺取，你的基地已化为一片炽热的弹坑，没人会来救你们！我不要'故事'！我要知道你从哪儿弄到那玩意儿的！快说！"

"I will find a way, you dickless asshole!" Asuka snapped back at him. "You have no idea what you're screwing with!"

"我总会找到办法的，你这个没种的混蛋！" 明日香反唇相讥，"你根本不知道自己在搅和什么！"

His pistol swung right back to center on her face. "So enlighten me, whore. I know you two degenerates were aboard that ship for the last two months. You were seen daily. So precisely when did you two morons find the time to pick up that giant red thing? By the way, my men are taking possession of it right now."

他的手枪再次对准她的脸。“那就给我解释解释，妓女。我知道你们这两个堕落的家伙在那艘船上待了最后两个月。天天有人看见你们。那你们究竟是什么时候抽空捡到那个巨大的红色玩意儿的？顺便说一句，我的手下现在正接管它。”

"Good luck getting in, jackass," Asuka shot back. "You're not getting inside my Red Whirlwind with anything short of the Positron Cannon, and I bet you don't have that on a trailer!"

"想进来？做梦去吧，蠢货，"明日香反唇相讥，"除非你有正电子加农炮，否则休想靠近我的赤旋风一步，我敢打赌你连个拖车都没有！"

Jinnai moved forward, pressing the muzzle of the pistol against Asuka's forehead. "Guess I'll just have to persuade you to give me the keys, then." Asuka gave a tiny hiss as the cold metal of the gun barrel dug against her skin, but merely glared back at him.

阵内向前逼近，将手枪的枪口紧贴在飞鸟的额头上。“看来我只能说服你把钥匙交出来了。”冰冷的枪管抵在皮肤上，飞鸟发出微弱的嘶声，但她只是回瞪着他。

'He's pointing a gun at Asuka. He's going to hurt Asuka.' Shinji's awareness snapped back into focus, sudden urgency overriding the pain from the bullet hole in his foot. 'I was a coward last time. No more. I promised. No more being small. I have to stop him.'

他正用枪指着明日香。他会伤害明日香的。' 真嗣的意识猛然聚焦，脚上弹孔的疼痛被突如其来的紧迫感所压倒。' 上次我是个懦夫。不会再有下次了。我承诺过。不再退缩。我必须阻止他。'

He staggered to his feet. His hands were bound to the chair back, but his legs were free. If he crouched forward, he could sort of stand and move. The pain in his foot was meaningless. He shuffled forward and shoved a surprised Jinnai out of the way, putting himself between Asuka and the gun. "Get… get away from her." His head was pounding again.

他摇摇晃晃地站起来。双手被绑在椅背上，但双腿是自由的。如果他向前蹲伏，就能勉强站立并移动。脚上的疼痛已无关紧要。他拖着步子向前，猛地将惊愕的阵内推到一边，让自己挡在明日香和枪之间。“离……离她远点。”他的头再次剧烈疼痛起来。

"Shinji! Don't-" Asuka began to shout at him.

“真嗣！别——”明日香冲他喊道。

"Oh, sit down, you idiot!" Jinnai snarled. He shoved the staggering young man to the side, but Shinji held on somehow to wobble his way back, putting himself between Jinnai and Asuka.

"哦，坐下吧，你这蠢货！" 金井咆哮道。他猛地推开摇摇晃晃的年轻人，但真嗣不知怎的坚持着，摇摆着回到原位，将自己置于金井和明日香之间。

"She... don't you hurt her..." Shinji gasped against the waves of pain coming up his leg. The gun pressed against his chest hardly registered. "You need to shoot someone, you shoot me."

"她...你别伤害她..." 真嗣在腿上传来的阵阵剧痛中喘息着。抵在他胸前的枪几乎没引起他的注意。"如果你想开枪，就冲我来吧。"

"Shinji, you idiot! Sit down!" Asuka shouted at his back. "You've already been shot, you lunatic!"

"真嗣，你个笨蛋！坐下！"明日香冲着他的背影喊道，"你都已经中枪了，疯子！"

"Better me than you!" Shinji rebutted. "I promised you a life! My life!"

"宁可是我而不是你！" 真嗣反驳道，"我承诺给你一个生命！我的生命！"

"Aww, aren't you two sweet," Jinnai mocked. He shoved Shinji out of the way again, harder, and forced him back down to sit next to Asuka. "I've got plenty more bullets, Mister Ikari," he said coldly. "More than enough for you both. But since she's apparently more talkative when I put a hole in you, perhaps I'll continue that method." He nudged the pistol against Shinji's forehead this time.

"哎呀，你们俩真甜蜜，" 阵内嘲讽道。他再次用力推开真嗣，迫使他重新坐回明日香旁边。"我这里子弹多得是，碇先生，" 他冷冷地说，"足够对付你们两个。不过既然她似乎在我给你开个洞时更爱说话，或许我会继续采用这个方法。" 这次，他用枪口轻轻顶了顶真嗣的额头。

"No, you won't, you ass!" Asuka growled. "You won't lay another finger on him! He's ten times the man you are, and our friends are coming! We've got more mecha, and they're coming right behind us!"

"不，你休想，蠢货！"明日香咆哮道，"你休想再碰他一根手指！他比你强十倍，而且我们的援军就要到了！我们还有更多的机甲，它们就跟在我们后面！"

"Do tell?" Jinnai said silkily. "And you wouldn't know 'ten times the man' if it bit you, bitch. You were always a dead lay. That's why I finally got sick of your whining and kicked you out to your own place, just so I wouldn't have to listen to you anymore."

"说来听听？" 金井柔滑地说道，"你这贱人，要是'十倍于男人'咬你一口，你都认不出来。你向来就是个性冷淡。所以我最后实在受够了你的抱怨，把你踢出去自立门户，只是为了不再听你啰嗦。"

"Ten times a night with him, Katsuhiko. Not even once in two years with you. You feel like a man yet?" Asuka sneered back.

"一晚上和他十次，胜彦。和你两年都没一次。你还觉得自己像个男人吗？" 明日香嘲讽地回击。

"And my Red Whirlwind may have gotten here three times as fast as the others because we're the best, but the others are coming, don't you doubt it. We've got two more coming to help us, and oh yes, a little surprise for you, too. The return of a very special guest star!"

我的红色旋风或许比其他人快了三倍到达这里，因为我们是最棒的，但其他人也正在赶来，对此你无需怀疑。还有两个帮手即将加入我们，哦对了，还为你准备了一个小小的惊喜。一位非常特别的嘉宾即将回归！

Shinji's new position was slightly angled, partially facing him towards the huge main screen the Operations floor was built around, but he could still see Asuka and Jinnai, and watch the UN Chairman's hand tighten its grip on the pistol until it shook, and his face go terrifyingly blank with fury.

真嗣的新位置略微倾斜，使他部分面向围绕着操作楼层的那块巨大的主屏幕，但他仍能看到明日香和阵内，并目睹联合国主席的手紧握手枪直至颤抖，面容因愤怒而变得恐怖地空白。

"Shut your whorish mouth, slut. You begged to be allowed into my bed. And I magnanimously let you, for two years! And this is how you repay me? Lies, betrayal, and more lies?" Jinnai's voice was disturbingly flat, but his eyes were twitching. "Describe these alleged 'two more', and your 'surprise'."

“闭上你那娼妇的嘴，贱人。你求着要进我的床。我宽宏大量地让你待了两年！这就是你回报我的方式？谎言，背叛，还有更多的谎言？”阵内的声音异常平淡，但他的眼睛却在抽搐。“说说这些所谓的‘另外两个’，还有你的‘惊喜’。”

"Get your gun off him and we'll talk," Asuka said with just a hint of mockery in her voice. "You'll like it. The other two are not quite as big and awesome as mine, but oh, our surprise is going to knock your pants off, and when it stomps in this shitty little imitation-Geofront of yours, its going to feel so familiar. I can't wait for our rescue. Tell you what, Jinnai... you surrender right now, and I'll see if I can't talk the leadership of our little army into not doing to you what we did to the last wanna-be dictator we took down in one afternoon."

"把你的枪从他身上挪开，我们再谈，"明日香说道，声音中带着一丝嘲讽。"你会喜欢的。另外两个虽然不及我的庞大威猛，但我们的惊喜绝对会让你大吃一惊，当它踏入你这破烂不堪的仿造地下都市时，那种熟悉感会让你心潮澎湃。我迫不及待想看到我们的救援了。告诉你吧，阵内...你现在投降，我会试着说服我们小军队的领导，让他们不要像上次那个妄想成为独裁者的人一样，一个下午就把你解决了。"

His gun swiveled away from Shinji and locked back on her. "Leadership," Jinnai echoed flatly. "Who?"

他的枪从真嗣身上移开，重新对准了她。“领导权，”神无平声重复道，“谁？”

"Oh..." Asuka paused, flicking her eyes to meet Shinji's for a moment, a small smile appearing on her lips. "Us."

"哦……" 明日香停顿了一下，目光短暂地与真嗣交汇，唇边浮现出一抹浅笑。"我们。"

Her head snapped back as Jinnai abruptly whipped the pistol across her face. "I said stop lying to me, bitch," he said, eerily calm.

她的头猛地向后一仰，因为阵内突然用手枪抽打在她的脸上。“我说了别再骗我，贱人，”他异常平静地说道。

Asuka slowly turned her face back to him, spitting a gobbet of blood at his shoes. "I'm not, asshole! They put us in command because we had the big mecha, and were the experienced Pilots! The Emperor and Empress personally put us in charge! And in a little bit, our friends and our surprise are going to show up and smash the rest of your forces, so you better give up now!"

明日香缓缓转过脸来，朝他的鞋子上吐了一口血沫。“我不是，混蛋！他们让我们指挥是因为我们拥有大型机甲，而且是有经验的驾驶员！皇帝和皇后亲自任命我们负责！不久之后，我们的朋友和我们的惊喜就会出现，摧毁你剩余的部队，所以你最好现在就投降！”

"I don't think so," Jinnai said, his voice still worryingly flat. "You are useless if all you're going to tell me are stupid lies and insults. You are prisoners, not commanders, and no one is coming to save-"

"我不这么认为，"金井说，他的声音依旧令人担忧地平淡。"如果你只会告诉我愚蠢的谎言和侮辱，那你毫无用处。你们是囚犯，不是指挥官，没人会来救你们——"

"Sir?" one of the techs at the ranks of consoles nervously interrupted. "We've got something on radar. High altitude, approaching fast. It's... very big, sir."

"长官？" 控制台旁队列中的一名技术人员紧张地打断道，"雷达上发现了一个目标。高空高速接近中。它……非常大，长官。"

Jinnai shot a glance at Asuka, who smirked back at him. He turned back to the tech. "Target it with the Positron Cannon and destroy it."

阵内瞥了一眼明日香，她回以一抹坏笑。他转头对技术人员说：“用正电子炮锁定目标，摧毁它。”

"We're trying, sir. It... it dodged the first blast, and it's moving fast enough we're only going to get one more shot before it reaches...here."

我们正在努力，先生。它……它躲过了第一波攻击，而且移动速度极快，我们只有一次机会，之后它就会到达……这里。

Shinji and Asuka shared a relieved look. Their message of warning had apparently made it through. Shinji allowed himself a tiny spark of hope.

真嗣和明日香交换了一个宽慰的眼神。他们发出的警告显然已经传达出去。真嗣让自己心中燃起了一丝微弱的希望。

"So... Jock-Stooge, you think? Or did Geek-Stooge reappear and come screaming after us?" Asuka said quietly.

“那么……是乔克跟班，你觉得呢？还是极客跟班又出现了，尖叫着追我们？”明日香轻声说道。

"I'll take either," Shinji replied just as low, "But I hope they don't get fried like we did. If that thing can cook Red Whirlwind in a couple shots, I don't want to see one of their Black Knights try to take it."

"我哪个都行，"真嗣同样低声回答，"但我希望他们别像我们那样被烤焦了。如果那玩意儿几下就能把红色旋风烤熟，我可不想看到他们的黑骑士去尝试对付它。"

"Why haven't you destroyed it yet?" Jinnai said icily to his men.

"为什么你们还没毁掉它？" 阵内冷冷地对他的手下说。

"Firing systems still dealing with overcharge damage from downing the last target, sir," the tech replied. "The overheats and blowouts were melting the transmission lines from the S2 Core! They're almost done recycling... 25 seconds!"

"发射系统仍在处理因击落最后一个目标而产生的过载损伤，长官，"技术人员回答道，"过热和爆裂导致 S2 核心的传输线路熔化！他们快要完成循环了……25 秒！"

Shinji craned his neck a little and could see the radar display on the big screen. The red blip of the approaching target, presumably one of their friends' mecha, was coming in fast. In fact, it looked like it was going to beat that countdown...

真嗣稍稍伸长了脖子，便能看到大屏幕上的雷达显示。那个快速逼近的红色光点，想必是他们朋友的一台机甲，正飞速接近。实际上，看起来它似乎要赶在倒计时结束之前到达...

"Three seconds... two, one... firing now!"

"三秒... 两秒，一秒... 现在发射！"

Or not. 或者不。

The screen flickered and the lights dimmed for a moment as the bottomless output of the S2 Engine was fully diverted to the Positron Cannon's demand.

屏幕闪烁，灯光瞬间暗淡，S2 引擎那深不可测的输出被完全转接至正电子炮的需求上。

"Direct hit on target!" the tech reported. "Secondary blast effects are blocking view! There's some kind of... some kind of field took the hit, but the target is... falling..."

"直接命中目标！"技术人员报告道，"二次爆炸效应遮挡了视线！似乎有什么东西……某种力场承受了打击，但目标正在……坠落……"

"Good," Jinnai said, turning away from the main screen. "Now, you two idiots can-"

"好，" 阵内说，转身离开主屏幕，"现在，你们两个傻瓜可以——"

"Sir!" the tech interrupted again.

"先生！"技术员再次打断道。

Jinnai wheeled back. "What?" he snarled.

阵内猛地转身。“什么？”他咆哮道。

"...it's falling straight down."

"...它正直直地往下掉。"

"Everything falls straight down, you moron!"

"所有东西都是直线下落的，你个笨蛋！"

"It's overhead," the tech finished.

"在头顶上，"技术员说完。

The entire base shook like an earthquake. A tremendous boom thundered through the Operations Center as dust and grit pattered down from the ceiling.

整个基地如同遭遇地震般剧烈摇晃。随着尘埃和砂砾从天花板上纷纷落下，运营中心内传来一声震耳欲聋的巨响。

"Did we kill it?" Jinnai asked. "I want eyes on it immediately!"

"我们干掉它了吗？" 阵内问道，"我要立刻看到它！"

"Camera tower #9 online... now!" the tech said.

"相机塔#9 已上线... 现在！" 技术员说道。

The main screen flickered, switching to a wall of orange and red flames that lit the entire Operations Center will the color of blood. Wherever the falling target had landed was burning.

主屏幕闪烁着，切换成一片橙红色的火墙，将整个指挥中心映照得如同血色。坠落目标所落之处，正熊熊燃烧。

A huge, hunched form strode slowly out of the flames.

一个庞大而佝偻的身影缓缓从火焰中走出。

"Mother of God..." one of Jinnai's guards said in shock.

"圣母玛利亚啊..." 阵内的一名守卫震惊地说道。

"It's... It's a demon!" another yelled.

"是...是恶魔！"另一人大喊。

Shinji's jaw dropped. 真嗣的下巴都惊掉了。

Asuka strained her neck, trying to see. She was still facing mostly away from the screen. "What is going on? What is it? Shinji, I can't-"

明日香努力伸长脖子，试图看清楚。她仍然大部分背对着屏幕。“发生了什么？那是什么？真嗣，我看不见——”

It was the most horrible, demonic, familiar beast possible, surrounded by a sea of flame and destruction. Its natural habitat. Shinji's lips peeled back in a shocked smile. "It's Eva Unit-01."

那是所能想象到的最可怕、最恶魔般的熟悉兽类，被一片火海与毁灭所环绕，正是它的天然栖息地。真嗣的嘴唇因震惊而微微上扬，露出一丝微笑。“这是 Eva 初号机。”

"That's... that's impossible," Jinnai said, stunned.

"这...这不可能," 阵内说, 惊呆了。

"Surprise, motherfucker~," Asuka sang, not at all quietly. "Told you so!"

"惊喜吧，混蛋~"，明日香唱道，声音一点也不小。"早就告诉过你了！"

"Fire on it immediately!" Jinnai screamed.

"立刻点火！"金井尖叫道。

"Trying, sir! I... Positron Cannon no longer reporting!"

尝试中，先生！我……粒子加农炮已无响应！

"Why not?!" “为什么不？！”

"It... Eva Unit-01... landed on it, sir!"

"它... 初号机... 降落在了上面，长官！"

"Aww..." Asuka mocked, "Did someone break your toy, Katsy-watsy? Now you've got nothing that can even scratch an AT-Field. You're fucked. I told you, our friends are coming. Surrender now, and my boyfriend and I will-"

"哎呀呀..." 明日香嘲讽道，"是不是有人弄坏了你的玩具，小胜？现在你连个 AT 力场都划不破了。你完蛋了。我早就说过，我们的朋友就要来了。现在投降，我和我男朋友或许还会——"

"BITCH!" Jinnai screamed at her. His pistol snapped up and he fired once, right into the center of her chest.

"贱人！" 金奈咆哮着向她吼道。他的手枪迅速抬起，对准她胸口正中开了一枪。

The world went into slow motion.

世界进入了慢动作。

Asuka's eyes widened in shock as her chair tipped over backwards, a splatter of blood from the exit wound outracing the chair's slow, slow fall to the ground. The rickety chair collapsed into broken pieces as Asuka's bodyweight landed.

明日香的双眼因震惊而睁大，椅子向后翻倒，出口伤口溅出的血迹比椅子缓慢坠地的速度更快。随着明日香的体重落下，那摇摇欲坠的椅子碎裂成片。

She thrashed once, her right arm flopping free from where the exiting bullet had snapped her bonds. Her hand was covered in her own blood.

她猛地一挣，右臂从子弹穿出时扯断的束缚中挣脱出来。她的手沾满了她自己的血。

She met Shinji's eyes with one wide-eyed, panicked look.

她睁大惊恐的双眼，与真嗣的目光相遇。

Then her eyes went dark.

接着她的眼前一片漆黑。

She stopped moving. 她停止了移动。

Her chest fell one last time as her breath rattled out of her in a bubbling sigh.

她的胸膛最后一次沉下，呼吸带着气泡般的叹息声渐渐消散。

The pool of blood underneath her kept spreading.

她身下的血泊不断蔓延。

Shinji's world went white.

真嗣的世界变得一片空白。

Author's Note, 04APR21: Yeah, I'm betting you'll want that next update real soon.

作者注，04APR21：是啊，我猜你很快就会想要下一个更新的。

### Chapter 42 A New World Is Born

Shinji's hands grabbed the chair behind his back, the ropes they'd bound him with parting like tissue paper. He rose in one motion, swinging the chair around his right side by one arm with as much force as he could, smashing the chair into Jinnai's arm.

真嗣的双手抓住背后的椅子，绑住他的绳索如同薄纸般断裂。他一跃而起，用尽全力将椅子单手抡至右侧，猛地砸向阵内的手臂。

The arm folded in a way it shouldn't and the pistol flew off to the side like it had been thrown. Jinnai's shout of pain was barely a whisper in Shinji's ears. He kept moving forward, bringing the chair around again.

手臂以不该有的方式折叠，手枪如被抛掷般飞向一旁。神无木阵内的痛呼在真嗣耳中仅是微弱的低语。他继续前进，再次挥动椅子。

One of Jinnai's guards tried to get between them. Shinji smashed the chair down over his head, bending it in half. The guard crumpled at his feet and Shinji launched himself at Jinnai.

金井的一名护卫试图介入他们之间。真嗣将椅子猛砸在那人头上，使其弯曲成两半。护卫倒在他的脚下，真嗣随即向金井扑去。

He was vaguely aware that he was screaming loud enough to tear at his throat, over and over.

他隐约意识到自己正在一遍又一遍地尖叫，声音大到几乎要撕裂他的喉咙。

A name. 一个名字。

He got ahold of Jinnai's uniform, and yanked him closer. Jinnai was shouting something in his face. Shinji smashed his forehead into Jinnai's nose. It crumbled with a satisfying crunch of bone.

他抓住了阵内的制服，猛地将他拽近。阵内在他面前大声叫嚷着什么。真嗣猛地用额头撞击阵内的鼻子，随着一声令人满意的骨头碎裂声，阵内的鼻子塌陷了。

A second guard was coming up on his right side. Shinji threw Jinnai's suddenly disoriented limp form at him and watched them both go down in a heap.

另一名守卫正从他的右侧逼近。真嗣将突然陷入混乱、身体瘫软的神无掷向他，目睹两人一同倒地，堆成一团。

Another guard wrapped his arms around Shinji from behind. Shinji snapped his head back, feeling another crunch, and the guard's arms went limp and fell away. He turned and punched a fourth guard in the face, following it up with a kick that folded him in half. He turned back towards Jinnai.

另一名守卫从背后抱住了真嗣。真嗣猛地向后一仰头，又是一声脆响，守卫的双臂顿时无力地松开。他转身一拳击中第四名守卫的脸部，紧接着一脚踢去，使其痛苦地弯折成两半。随后，他转向了阵内。

He was still screaming. 他仍在尖叫。

A fifth guard, clawed hands raked across his eyes, and he fell out of the way, screaming. A sixth swung a truncheon at him. Shinji grabbed his hand, turning just enough to convert the guard's motion into a flip, and tossed him aside, right into a seventh guard just approaching. Both went down in a tangle of limbs and breaking bones.

第五名守卫，被利爪划过双眼，惨叫着倒向一旁。第六名挥舞着警棍向他袭来，而 Shinji 抓住其手腕，巧妙转身将其动作转化为一个翻摔，顺势将他甩向刚靠近的第七名守卫，两人顿时纠缠倒地，骨骼断裂声随之响起。

He reached Jinnai again. The Secretary-General was just staggering to his feet when Shinji grabbed his uniform coat again and began landing punch after punch on his face.

他再次逼近阵内。秘书长刚摇摇晃晃地站起来，真嗣就再次抓住他的制服外套，开始一拳接一拳地猛击他的脸。

"YOU KILLED HER! YOU KILLED ASUKA! YOU KILLED HER!"

你杀了她！你杀了明日香！你杀了她！

He'd cost Jinnai several teeth before two BABYKA guards finally grabbed him from behind. They pulled him off, forcing him to turn to deal with them. The two men were easily 10cm taller and far more muscular than the young man in the ripped and bloodied Pilot's suit.

他让阵内掉了好几颗牙，直到两名 BABYKA 警卫终于从背后抓住了他。他们将他拉开，迫使他转身应对。这两名男子比身穿破烂血迹斑斑飞行员服的年轻人高出至少 10 厘米，肌肉也远比他发达。

They lasted about ten seconds.

持续了大约十秒钟。

They were also the last guards still on their feet. The remaining techs and operators in the room just stared in shock.

他们也是最后站立的守卫。房间里剩下的技术人员和操作员只是震惊地盯着。

He turned away from the broken and unconscious men and prepared to launch himself at Jinnai again, this time with the intent of not stopping until he could no longer punch. He stopped when the bullet smashed into his left shin, pure impact achieving what the pain from the first wound could not. He dropped to his knee, still screaming.

他转身离开那些破碎且失去意识的人，准备再次向阵内发起攻击，这次决心打到再也挥不动拳头为止。然而，当子弹击中他的左小腿时，纯粹的冲击力达到了第一次受伤的痛苦所未能达到的效果，他顿时跪倒在地，依旧尖叫不止。

"YOU KILLED HER!" "你杀了她！"

Another bullet jerked his right shoulder as it just nicked the outside edge of his arm. The sound of the shot was finally audible as the pain of his leg at last forced him to grit his teeth against just screaming incoherently.

又一发子弹擦过他的右肩，仅仅划伤了手臂的外缘。枪声终于传入耳中，而腿部的剧痛最终迫使他咬紧牙关，以免失控地尖叫出来。

Jinnai had used the distraction of Shinji smashing the last couple guards to recover his pistol. He blinked out of one good eye and held his smoking pistol with his remaining unbroken arm less like a weapon and more like a talisman that would hopefully keep the screaming, bloody berserker in front of him at bay. He took advantage of the break in Shinji's shouting to shout back. "I've got all the power here, Ikari! I make all the decisions! I get what I want! And I want to know where the fuck you two morons found that giant red thing! And where the fuck did you get Eva Unit-01?!"

金井趁真嗣击倒最后几名守卫的混乱之际，重新夺回了他的手枪。他用仅剩的一只好眼眨了眨，用那只未受伤的手臂握着冒烟的手枪，与其说是当作武器，不如说更像是一个希望能阻挡眼前这个狂暴血腥的疯子的护身符。他抓住真嗣咆哮的间隙，大声回敬道：“这里的一切权力都在我手中，碇！所有的决定都由我来做！我得到我想要的一切！我他妈就想知道你们这两个蠢货从哪儿找到那巨大的红色玩意儿！还有，你们他妈的从哪儿搞到的 Eva 初号机？！”

"You shot her...you killed...I...I didn't want it to end like this..." Shinji said, hardly listening to Jinnai's yelling.

"你射中了她...你杀了她...我...我不想这样结束..." 真嗣说道，几乎没听进阵内的怒吼。

"No one cares what you want, you spineless twit! If I wanted to know, I'd fucking ask you what you want!" Jinnai's uniform had a mottling of blood spatters all over its front, a macabre camouflage pattern. The dark pattern set off the white spittle flecking his lips.

没人关心你想要什么，你这个没骨气的蠢货！如果我想知道，我会他妈的问你想要什么！”阵内制服的前襟上血迹斑斑，形成了一种诡异的伪装图案。这暗色图案映衬着他唇边白色的唾沫星子。

"I want… her back," Shinji replied in a strange tone of voice. "I want her with me forever. And...I want to see you dead for hurting her."

"我想要……她回来，" 真嗣用一种奇怪的语调回答道，"我想永远和她在一起。还有……我想看到你因为伤害她而死去。"

Jinnai's sneer got bigger. "Well, since I'm the one holding the gun, unless you tell me what I want to hea-" Jinnai stopped talking very quickly. Most people do when someone puts the business end of an M1911 .45 caliber pistol to the back of their head. The sharp, clear click of the hammer being cocked just served to underline the implicit threat in the cool kiss of the barrel's metal against the back of his head.

金奈的冷笑愈发嚣张：“好吧，既然枪在我手里，除非你告诉我我想听的——”金奈的话戛然而止。当有人将一把 M1911 .45 口径手枪的枪口抵在后脑勺时，大多数人都会如此。扳机扣动的清脆咔哒声，更是凸显了金属枪管冰冷触感背后隐含的威胁。

"You want to see him dead, dear baka? I think we might be able to arrange that," Asuka cooed. "Secretary-General Jinnai is now on my shit list for what he just did, and I think I owe you a present for trying to take that shot for me. You kept your promise, Shinji. Thank you."

“你想看到他死吗，亲爱的傻瓜？我想我们或许能安排一下，”明日香柔声说道。“秘书长阵内现在因为刚才的所作所为上了我的黑名单，我觉得我欠你一份礼物，因为你试图为我挡下那一枪。你遵守了承诺，真嗣。谢谢你。”

Jinnai started sweating. "You….you're dead! I shot you right through the heart! I watched you die! How…how…" he babbled.

阵内开始冒汗。“你……你已经死了！我一枪打穿了你的心脏！我亲眼看着你死去！怎么……怎么……”他语无伦次地说。

"I am Asuka Langley Sohryu. 'I Will Fight Beyond Death' is the motto of the ship that bears my name, and they chose wisely. I've been dead before, Mister Secretary-General. I was ripped apart by an entire squadron of Mass Production Evas and eaten. And then the world ended. That did not stop me. You think shooting me in the heart will even slow me down? And then you threaten to kill my boyfriend? Tisk tisk," Asuka said lightly. "Now you're getting me angry."

我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。“超越死亡而战”是我名下舰船的座右铭，他们选得真准。秘书长阁下，我曾死过，被一整队量产型 EVA 撕裂吞噬。随后世界终结了。那并未阻止我。你以为射穿我心脏就能让我减速？还威胁要杀我男友？啧啧，”明日香轻描淡写地说，“现在你可真惹恼我了。”

"Your boyfriend? This isn't some fucking romantic comedy, you stupid bitch! Guar-OW!" Asuka slapped him in the temple with her pistol as she plucked his own out of his limp hand.

你男朋友？这可不是什么狗屁浪漫喜剧，你个蠢婊子！保证——嗷！” 明日香用手枪敲了他的太阳穴，同时从他无力的手中夺走了他的枪。

"Shut up, Jinnai. He's my boyfriend if I say he is. And like I said, he's a thousand times better in bed than you ever were. He got me off twice the first time he even touched me. You couldn't manage even once in two years. He's bigger, too."

闭嘴，金井。如果我说他是我的男朋友，那他就是。就像我之前说的，他在床上的表现比你强上千倍。他第一次触碰我，就让我高潮了两次。而你两年里连一次都没能做到。他的尺寸也更大。

"Sohryu, in about two seconds my GUARDS are going to shoot you both and this time I'm going to make sure it sticks!"

“Sohryu，大约两秒后，我的卫兵就会射杀你们两个，这次我会确保你们一命呜呼！”

Asuka ignored his threats and kept right on going. "But you're right, this isn't some romantic comedy. We're not in junior high school anymore. It's silly to call him my boyfriend. So no more of that."

明日香对他的威胁置若罔闻，继续说道：“不过你说的对，这可不是什么浪漫喜剧。我们早已不是初中生了。称他为我的男朋友实在幼稚。以后不会再这么说了。”

The awestruck smile that had spread across Shinji's face at her seeming resurrection dimmed in confusion. "Asuka?" he said in a hurt and confused voice.

真嗣脸上因她仿佛复活而震惊的笑容，在困惑中黯淡了。“明日香？”他用一种受伤而困惑的声音说道。

She kept her eyes mostly on Jinnai and his hands, but flicked them to meet his long enough to give him a quick, fierce grin. "We should stop dancing around each other. We're both old enough to know better. Like when it's time to upgrade, say to 'fiancé'. What do you say, Shinji?" Asuka' kept the gun on Jinnai, but her intense gaze swung to meet his eyes. "Will you marry me?"

她大部分时间都盯着阵内和他的双手，但目光短暂地与他交汇，给了他一个迅速而热烈的笑容。"我们不应该再互相试探了。我们都是足够成熟的人，应该明白事理。比如到了该升级的时候，比如说升级为'未婚夫'。你怎么说，真嗣？"明日香依旧用枪指着阵内，但她那炽热的目光转向了他的眼睛。"你愿意娶我吗？"

Pure shock ruled Shinji's expression now. His smile was still hanging on, now tinted with amazed hope and disbelief. "Wha….?"

此刻，纯然的震惊支配着真嗣的表情。他的笑容依旧挂在脸上，现在染上了惊奇的希望与难以置信。“什……？”

"You kept your promise of owing me a life, but I don't feel like releasing you. I want you…I need you right beside me for good. For always. ...I hear that's what two people do when they love each other. You're mine…and I want to be yours. I love you."

你遵守了欠我一命的承诺，但我并不想放你走。我想要你……我需要你永远留在我身边。永远。……听说这就是相爱的两个人会做的事。你是我的……我也想成为你的。我爱你。

The air shook without a sound again. There was the imperceptible sound of a bubble popping and a tension to the air that had been a constant, unnoticed background vanished.

空气再次无声地震动。伴随着气泡破裂的微不可闻之声，那种一直作为恒定而未被察觉的背景存在的空气张力消失了。

"What the fuck was that?" Jinnai asked.

"这他妈是什么玩意儿？" 阵内问道。

'I am… satisfied, Pilot Sohryu,' whispered a voice without sound.

我……感到满意，飞行员惣流，' 无声之音低语道。

Shinji and Asuka's eyes widened.

真嗣和明日香瞪大了眼睛。

"And who the fuck said that? Enough! Guards! Someone blow this bitch's head off!" Jinnai ordered.

“这他妈是谁说的？够了！卫兵！给我把这婊子的头轰掉！”金奈命令道。

Nothing happened. 什么也没发生。

"Well?! Somebody shoot her!" Jinnai wisely still didn't move his head too much, lest he get shot by a reflexive squeeze by Asuka, but he did dart his glance around to the few guards around the room that were still conscious and intact enough to have struggled to their feet. They stood as perfectly still as their commander until one who had recovered his weapon slowly started to raise the rifle from low guard.

“快！谁来开枪打她！”金奈明智地依旧没有过多移动头部，以免被明日香本能地扣动扳机击中，但他确实迅速扫视了房间内少数几个还能挣扎着站起来的清醒且完好的守卫。他们像他们的指挥官一样纹丝不动地站着，直到一个找回武器的守卫开始慢慢从低姿警戒状态举起步枪。

"Hekulade!" someone shouted far above them.

"赫库拉德！" 有人在他们上方远处喊道。

Jinnai looked up. "Who-?"

阵内抬头望去。“谁——？”

Then the roof fell in and the world was filled with the sound of explosions. A huge purple fist smashed in through the ceiling thirty meters to the side, covering the back part of the Operations Center away from the main screen in huge chunks of concrete. Jinnai and his guards hit the floor. The room filled with swirling smoke and dust.

接着屋顶坍塌，世界被爆炸声填满。一只巨大的紫色拳头从三十米外的天花板砸入，将远离主屏幕的运营中心后部覆盖在巨大的混凝土块下。阵内和他的警卫们扑倒在地。房间里弥漫着旋转的烟尘。

Asuka and Shinji kept standing, grinning at each other. Even the world ending again couldn't break into their own little universe.

明日香和真嗣依旧站立着，彼此咧嘴而笑。即便是世界再次终结，也无法打破他们那小小的宇宙。

The explosions ceased. There was a strange sound of high-pitched hissing, like water hitting a superheated metal plate, and a flash of light too bright to look at lit up the smoke like a strobe light. The huge arm of Unit-01 moved enough to let a gap open up in the breached ceiling large enough for a man to fit through, and there was the sound of heavy metal footsteps approaching.

爆炸声停息了。一种奇特的高频嘶嘶声响起，宛如水珠撞击在炽热的金属板上，紧接着一道耀眼得无法直视的光芒穿透烟雾，犹如频闪灯般照亮四周。巨大的初号机手臂微微移动，使得破损的天花板间露出一个足以供人通过的空隙，随之而来的是沉重的金属脚步声逐渐逼近。

The smoke cleared, and Jinnai looked up into the gaping barrel of a nerve disruptor pistol. The hugely grinning woman holding it couldn't possibly be doing so, since she was already standing behind him, still holding a .45. Jinnai twisted his head around far enough to confirm that, yes, Asuka Langley Sohryu was still behind him, wearing her bloodstained and bullet-ripped Pilot's suit. And in front of him, wearing a matte-black suit of power armor with the helmet retracted to show her face.

烟雾散去，金井抬头望向神经干扰手枪那张开的枪口。手持枪械、笑容满面的女子不可能同时出现在他面前，因为她已经站在他身后，手中还握着一把.45 手枪。金井费力地扭头确认，没错，明日香·兰格雷依旧站在他身后，身着血迹斑斑、弹孔累累的飞行员服。而在他面前，则是一位身穿哑光黑色动力装甲、头盔已收起露出面容的女子。

"Well, look at this! Appears we got here just in the nick of time! What does that make us?" the armored Asuka said jauntily.

“哎呀，瞧瞧这个！看来我们来得正是时候！这让我们成了什么？”身着盔甲的明日香俏皮地说道。

"Big damn heroes, love," answered a similarly armored Shinji from next to her, grinning.

“大英雄，亲爱的，”同样身着盔甲的真嗣在她旁边回答道，咧嘴笑着。

"Ain't we just?" Asuka replied jauntily.

"我们不正是这样吗？" 明日香俏皮地回答道。

"What? What? What?" Jinnai said helplessly.

"什么？什么？什么？" 阵内无奈地说。

"Oh, shut up and go to sleep, you stupid little man," the armored woman said, and shot him in the face. A snapping and sparking electric blue nimbus briefly flashed around Jinnai's head. His eyes rolled up in their sockets and he crumpled to the floor, unconscious.

"哦，闭嘴睡觉去吧，你这愚蠢的小个子。" 身披铠甲的女子说道，随即一枪射向他的面部。一道噼啪作响、电光蓝的辉光短暂地环绕在神无井的头部周围。他的眼珠翻转进眼窝，整个人瘫倒在地，陷入了昏迷。

"Aww, I wanted to do that. After all, he shot me. And that hurt!" the Asuka with the .45 complained. She blinked, and turned to the bloodied Pilot behind her, still on his knees. "Well, you're down on one knee, which is good, but I'm the one who asked. And don't you ever get shot for me again!" She tucked the .45 into a holster at her thigh that wasn't there, and it vanished.

"哎呀，我本来也想这么做的。毕竟，他朝我开枪了。那可真疼！" 手持.45 的明日香抱怨道。她眨了眨眼，转向身后跪在地上的血迹斑斑的飞行员，"看，你已经单膝跪地了，这很好，但求婚的是我。而且，以后再也不许为我挡枪了！" 她将.45 手枪插入大腿上并不存在的枪套中，随即它便消失了。

"Me?!" Shinji gasped through the pain. "What about you?! How… I… you got shot through the heart! You… you died! I… I thought you died? How?" He started to topple forward.

"我？！" 真嗣忍痛喘息着，"那你呢？！怎么……我……你心脏中枪了！你……你死了！我……我以为你死了？怎么回事？" 他开始向前倾倒。

Asuka caught him. "Oh shit, you're still bleeding! Don't you dare die on me!" She turned her head. "Medic!"

明日香抓住了他。"该死，你还在流血！你敢给我死试试！"她转过头喊道："医疗兵！"

Shinji shook his head. "I'm not going anywhere until I hear how you're not dead!" He started to cry. "You're not dead! You're not dead! Oh gods, Asuka, you're not dead!"

真嗣摇了摇头。“你不告诉我你怎么可能还活着，我哪儿也不去！”他开始哭泣。“你还活着！你还活着！哦，天啊，明日香，你还活着！”

"I'm… still not clear on that myself," she admitted, cradling him against her. She looked down at the neat nine millimeter hole in her torn plugsuit. The front had a trickle of blood dripping down it's front, but there was no hole underneath. Her right hand and side were still heavily splashed with blood, though.

"我自己也还没弄明白，"她坦言，将他拥在怀中。她低头看向自己破损的插入栓服上那个整齐的九毫米弹孔，前襟正缓缓滴落血迹，但弹孔下方却并无伤口。尽管如此，她的右手和右侧身躯仍溅满了血迹。

"Mmm, looks like a pretty good heal on a gunshot wound from the back, kid," the older Asuka said, kneeling beside them. Her armor made her seem twice as large. "However, your cute little idiot here is still bleeding pretty good from that fresh one in his leg I can see, so let's deal with that." She pulled his leg out from under him and pointed her armored finger at the freely bleeding hole in his shinbone.

"嗯，看起来你处理背后的枪伤做得不错，孩子，"年长的飞鸟说着，跪在他们旁边。她的盔甲让她显得体型翻倍。"不过，你这可爱的小傻瓜腿上新伤还在流血不止，我们得处理一下。"她把他的腿从身下拽出来，用装甲手指指向他胫骨上那个血流如注的伤口。

A cloudy white glob of gel the size of a chicken egg oozed out of her fingertip and dropped into the hole, quickly sealing it over. The bleeding stopped instantly. Shinji's face cleared as the pain stopped a moment later. "What the-"

一颗云朵般洁白的凝胶，大小如鸡蛋，从她的指尖渗出，落入洞中，迅速将其封住。出血瞬间止住。片刻后，疼痛消失，真嗣的脸色也随之明朗起来。“这是——”

"Imperial Navy grade healing nanite gel. Much better than the basic safety set you two are running. You'll be fine in a few minutes. You're going to be hungry enough to eat an entire Angel in an hour, though. Thirsty too. They take a lot of water," the older Asuka said. She stood up and smirked. "So… you two were in the middle of him receiving a well-deserved chewing out for getting shot?"

帝国海军级治疗纳米凝胶，比你们俩用的基础急救包好多了。几分钟你们就会没事。不过，一小时后你们会饿得能吃下一整只天使，还会很渴。它们消耗大量水分。”年长的明日香站起身，嘴角勾起一抹笑意，“那么……你们俩刚才是在他因为中枪而受到应得的训斥吗？”

"Basic safety set... Rayana, you sneaky..." Asuka blinked and looked back at Shinji. "Hey, yeah! You stop that! Never again!"

"基本安全设置... 蕾雅娜，你真狡猾..." 明日香眨了眨眼，回头看向真嗣。"嘿，对！你别再那样了！绝不能再有下次！"

"You got shot too!" "你也中枪了！"

"Only once! You got shot three times!"

仅此一次！你中了三枪！

"My gods, it's like looking in a mirror," the older Shinji said dryly. The older Asuka reached back behind her without looking and flicked him in the side of the head. His smirk didn't even flicker.

"我的天，这简直像照镜子一样。" 年长的真嗣干巴巴地说道。年长的明日香头也不回地反手一弹，正中他的太阳穴。然而，他脸上的坏笑连一丝波动都没有。

There were more and more of the power armored figures moving around the room now, disarming the few of Jinnai's guards who even still had weapons and shepherding them out of the doors to the back of the room. The older Shinji looked around at the armored troops swirling around, then nodded, tapping a spot on his gauntlet. All at once, the matte-black armor of all the troops in sight shifted to a glossy black, with gold trimmed insignia and markings appearing.

越来越多的动力装甲身影在房间内移动，解除少数仍持有武器的阵内卫兵的武装，并引导他们从房间后部的门离开。年长的真嗣环顾四周，看着这些装甲部队穿梭其中，然后点头，轻敲了一下他的护手。刹那间，所有可见部队的哑光黑装甲转变为亮黑色，金色镶边的徽章和标记随之显现。

"There. Now that we all look a bit more presentable, and our Marines are securing this place, we can introduce ourselves, though I'm sure you already know 'who' we are to some extent," the older Shinji said, still very dry. "Junior Fleet Captain of the Red Shinji Ikari-Sohryu, Co-Captain of the HMS Shinji Ikari, at your service. The sarcastic lady doing your healing is Junior Fleet Captain of the Red Asuka Langley Ikari-Sohryu, also Co-Captain of the HMS Shinji Ikari, and as I'm sure you've put together, my lovely wife. Charmed, I'm sure."

好了，现在我们都稍微体面些了，我们的海军陆战队员也在确保这个地方的安全，我们可以自我介绍了，虽然我相信你们已经对我们有所了解。"年长的真嗣依旧干巴巴地说道，"我是红真嗣一尉舰长，HMS 真嗣一尉号的副舰长，为您效劳。那位正在给你疗伤的讽刺女士是红明日香一尉舰长，也是 HMS 真嗣一尉号的副舰长，我相信你已经猜到了，她是我可爱的妻子。我相信，您一定会感到荣幸的。"

Asuka left off staring at the amused older version of herself to look at the armored Shinji. "Ah... yeah, I kind of guessed most of that. But how did you get... wait, that little whisper..." She looked at the bloody Shinji in her arms. "Wondergirl dropped the block?!"

明日香不再凝视着那个面带笑意的年长版自己，转而看向身着盔甲的真嗣。“啊……嗯，我大概猜到了大部分。但是你怎么会……等等，那个微弱的声音……”她低头看着怀中满身是血的真嗣。“奇迹少女解除了封锁？！”

Captain Ikari-Sohryu shrugged. "We've been on hot standby for a while," he said, "And suddenly, whatever was blocking portals just dissipated, and we jumped in. The ship's in orbit a bit past Luna right now, and we've got the HMS Howard Florey inbound in about 4 hours to start on local reconstruction, so we're here to back you two up. I...oh, wow."

碇源堂-惣流舰长耸了耸肩。“我们已经处于热备状态一段时间了，”他说，“突然间，阻碍传送门的东西消失了，我们就跳了进来。现在飞船正位于月球轨道之外，大约四小时后，HMS 霍华德·弗洛里号将抵达，开始当地重建工作，所以我们是来支援你们俩的。我……哦，哇。”

The remaining clouds of dust and smoke in the room were glowing brightly, lighting up everything as the brilliant winged form dropped in through the hole in the ceiling alongside Unit-01's still positioned arm. The new arrival landed heavily, then staggered over towards them, his wings retracting into his back in a cloud of feathers. "You're... still alive?" TJ rasped. His eyes were still glowing points of light, but his face was haggard. "Good..."

房间内残余的尘埃与烟雾熠熠生辉，照亮了一切，只见那光辉灿烂、生有双翼的身影从天花板的破洞中降落，恰好落在仍保持姿势的初号机手臂旁。新来者重重着地，随后踉跄着向他们走来，翅膀化作一团羽毛，收回了背中。“你……还活着？”TJ 嘶哑地问道。他的双眼仍是闪烁的光点，但面容憔悴。“好……”

"TJ? Gott, man, stand down!" Asuka cried. "You can't have much time left! We're alright! We've got... er..." she looked back at the armored couple. "Um, 'ourselves' here to cover things!"

"TJ？天啊，伙计，冷静点！你剩下的时间不多了！我们没事！我们有……呃……"她回头看了看那对装甲夫妇。"嗯，我们'自己'在这儿处理事情！"

"I... managed to... stretch... things out... with Unit-01's... S2 Organ..." he panted. "Infinite soul-aspected energy... when we ran it through... your father... bought me an hour... But yes... I need..." He straightened up and saluted the older couple. "Permission to withdraw to Avalon and fall down, Sir and Ma'am?"

"我...设法...用初号机的...S2 机关...拖延了时间..." 他喘息着说，"无限灵魂属性能量...当我们运行它时...你的父亲...为我争取了一个小时...但没错...我需要..." 他挺直身子，向那对年长夫妇敬礼，"请求撤退至阿瓦隆并倒下，长官和夫人？"

The older Asuka looked at him. She opened her mouth to speak, then halted, narrowing her eyes at him. "Sweet Empress's Tits, you're soulburning?" she exclaimed. "Jesus, yes, get yourself out of here immediately, Lieutenant! And stop that! Shinji, flash back home and tell them we've got another stupid Prince coming in hot and burned!"

年长的明日香看着他，张口欲言又止，眯起眼睛。“天啊，你在灵魂燃烧？”她惊呼道，“快，立刻离开这里，中尉！别再继续了！真嗣，赶紧回家报告，我们这儿又来了个自以为是的王子，情况紧急且糟糕透顶！”

The older Shinji muttered something into his suit's collar. TJ just nodded and waved his hand to his left. A glowing portal like a pool of shining liquid stood on it's side, and he staggered through it. The Imperial Naval officer shook her head as it shrank closed behind him.

年长的真嗣对着他的制服领子低声说了些什么。TJ 只是点了点头，并向左边挥了挥手。一个发光的传送门，犹如一池闪亮的液体，竖立在那里，他踉跄着穿了过去。帝国海军军官摇了摇头，看着传送门在他身后缩小关闭。

"Goddamn, Imperial Family members are all crazy. Wait... Unit-01 and 'your father'? Fuck, does that mean Commander Asshole is in that thing?" She pointed at the huge purple and black arm still extending down from the ceiling.

该死，皇室成员都疯了吗。等等...零号机和你父亲？操，那是不是意味着混蛋指挥官在那东西里面？她指向那只依然从天花板垂下的巨大紫黑色手臂。

"Um... yes," the Shinji on the floor confirmed. "Going by 'Private Rokubungi'. He volunteered to... Pilot it and activate the Core, when we needed all the backup we could get."

“呃……是的，”躺在地上的真嗣确认道，“自称‘六分仪私人士兵’。在我们急需一切支援时，他自愿……驾驶并激活核心。”

"My my, that must have been painful," the armored Shinji said. He smiled darkly. "Good."

"哎呀，那一定很痛吧，"身着盔甲的绫波丽说道。他阴沉地笑了笑。"很好。"

"Especially if they were running the S2 Organ wide-open for power to supplement his soulburning," the older Asuka added. "All that power would have had to run right through the Core, and the soul in it. It would have been like having to grab onto a live high-voltage line and hang on. Serves him right."

“尤其是如果他们将 S2 机关全功率运转以补充他的灵魂燃烧，”年长的飞鸟补充道，“所有那些能量都必须直接通过核心及其中的灵魂。那感觉就像不得不抓住一根通电的高压线并紧握不放。他活该。”

"I still don't feel like dealing with my father right now," Shinji said tiredly.

"我现在还是不想面对我父亲，" 真嗣疲惫地说。

"Me either," Asuka agreed. "I want to talk to him about as much as... Hey!" She looked at Shinji. "Wonderbitch dropped the block when I asked you... She can hear us!"

"我也不想," 明日香同意道。"我跟他谈话的欲望就跟...嘿！" 她看向真嗣。"那个贱人在我问你的时候放下了积木...她能听见我们说话！"

Asuka looked at the ceiling. "I know you can hear us, First Child! Show yourself! You've got a lot to answer for!" she shouted angrily.

明日香盯着天花板，怒气冲冲地喊道：“我知道你能听见我们，第一适格者！现身吧！你有很多事情需要解释！”

"As do you, Pilot Sohryu," Rei said coldly from midair five meters above and in front of her. There was no transition or sound. She was just suddenly there, still dressed in Tokyo-3 Central Middle School's uniform. "But you have convinced me you truly care for Pilot Ikari. I... withdraw my objection to your... companionship."

"你也一样，碇真嗣君。" 绫波丽冷冷地说道，她悬浮在空中，距离地面五米，正对着他。没有任何过渡或声响，她就那样突然出现，依旧穿着第三新东京市中央中学的校服。"但你已经让我相信，你确实关心碇一尉。我...撤回对你...陪伴的反对。"

Rei looked closer at the quartet below her. "...why are there two of you? And two Pilot Ikaris?"

瑞伊更仔细地观察着下方的四人组。“……为什么会有两个你？还有两个飞行员伊卡瑞斯？”

"Maybe I'm just too awesome to be contained to one body," the armored Asuka said dryly. "Hello, Wondergirl. I hear you've been making life difficult for my analog and her baka. Please stop being such a bitch, and be more like our Rei, hmm? I named my eldest daughter after my best friend, you know. It'd be a shame if she saw her namesake being such a raging asshole."

"或许是我太出色了，一个身体装不下，"身着盔甲的明日香干巴巴地说道，"你好，奇迹女孩。听说你一直在给我的分身和她那笨蛋添麻烦。别那么刻薄了，学学我们的零号，嗯？你知道吗，我给大女儿取了我最好朋友的名字。要是她看到自己的名字被这么糟蹋，真是可惜了。"

Rei narrowed her eyes at her. "...get off my planet."

瑞伊眯起眼睛看着她。“……离开我的星球。”

"Make me, you-" 让我，你-

"Gott, it is like looking in a mirror," the older Shinji muttered darkly, and clamped his hand over his wife's mouth. "Hi Rei, nice to see you, lovely to meet a new copy of our old friend. Asuka, please do not antagonize the local demigoddess?" he said quickly.

"天哪，这简直就像照镜子一样，"年长的真嗣低沉地说道，并用手捂住了妻子的嘴。"你好，零，很高兴见到你，很荣幸能遇到我们老朋友的新复制体。明日香，请不要激怒当地的半神好吗？"他迅速地说。

Rei pursed her lips, but dropped it. She looked at the visibly older man. "You are not the Pilot Ikari I knew. Who are you?"

绫波轻抿双唇，却未深究。她望向那位明显年长的男子，问道：“你不是我所认识的碇真嗣。你是谁？”

"We work for Emperor Daniel, who I understand you've spoken to. We're from a world were the three of us got along a lot better," he offered, "and we're here to help 'ourselves'. When you removed that block, we dropped in just in time." He carefully took his hand of his wife's mouth. "'Let's all be good friends', eh? Right, Asuka?"

我们效忠于皇帝丹尼尔，我猜你已经和他交谈过了。我们来自一个世界，在那里我们三人相处得更为融洽，”他解释道，“我们来此是为了帮助‘我们自己’。当你移除那个障碍时，我们恰好及时降临。”他小心翼翼地从妻子的嘴上移开手。“‘让我们都成为好朋友’，对吧？对吧，明日香？”

Captain Ikari-Sohryu grumbled but nodded. "'If I am ordered to, I will,'" she muttered at him. "We're not here to fight, Wondergirl. Just to help out the 'us' that you left high and dry when y-"

碇源堂-惣流舰长嘟囔着，但还是点了点头。“如果我被命令这么做，我会执行的，”她对他嘀咕道。“我们不是来战斗的，奇迹少女。只是来帮助那个被你抛下不管的‘我们’，当……”

Shinji cleared his throat. "Er... thank you for removing the block, Rei. I... I did try to tell you Asuka and I were... not what you thought."

真嗣清了清嗓子。“呃……谢谢你解除了误会，绫波。我……我确实试图告诉你，我和明日香并不是你所想的那样。”

Rei frowned just slightly. "You said that, yes. But she was still closed. Now..." Rei looked both satisfied and sad. "Now she is open, completely. Your bond is now fully mutual. I cannot deny you both what you want when it is so." She looked at Asuka. "But heed my warning, Pilot Sohryu; You will always give him all of you, or I will..." Rei chewed on her words for a moment. "...be upset with you."

绫波微微皱眉。“你是这么说的，没错。但她那时还是封闭的。现在……”绫波看起来既满足又悲伤。“现在她完全敞开了。你们的羁绊如今是全然相互的。既然如此，我无法拒绝你们双方的愿望。”她看向明日香。“但请听好我的警告，惣流驾驶员；你要么全心全意地给予他，否则我……”绫波犹豫了一下，咀嚼着措辞。“……会对你感到失望。”

"For an all-seeing goddess, you don't listen too well, First," Asuka bit back at her. "I meant every single thing I just said. I admit it. I love this baka of mine more than I can even put into words. He's stood by me at my most intolerably bitchy, suicidal, and insecure, and loves me anyhow. He's bled for me, fought for me, and was ready to die for me. He's the only man who's ever made me happy to be a woman and happy to be me. He's going to be the father of my children. I'm not letting him go for anyone or anything, ever. He's mine. I asked him to marry me be...beca-..."

对于一位全知的女神，你听得可不太好，首先，"明日香反驳道，"我刚才说的每一句话都是真心的。我承认，我爱这个笨蛋胜过言语所能表达。在我最难以忍受的刻薄、自毁和不安时，他始终陪伴在我身边，无论如何都爱着我。他为我流过血，为我战斗过，甚至愿意为我而死。他是唯一一个让我为身为女性、为成为自己而感到幸福的男人。他将成为我孩子的父亲。无论是谁，无论什么，我都不会放手。他是我的。我请求他娶我……因……因……"

She drifted to a halt and looked at Shinji. "You haven't answered me."

她缓缓停下脚步，望向真嗣。“你还没回答我。”

Shinji blinked. "I... oh! Um..."

真嗣眨了眨眼。“我……哦！呃……”

The armored Shinji leaned down towards his ear and loudly stage-whispered. "Piece of advice, 'me'. Say 'yes'. Trust me, you'll like it."

身着盔甲的绫波丽俯身在他耳边，大声地用舞台上的耳语方式说道：“给你个建议，‘我’。说‘是’。相信我，你会喜欢的。”

His wife poked him in the side of the head as he straightened back up. "Dork."

他妻子在他脑袋侧面戳了一下，他刚直起身来。“呆子。”

He grinned back at her and blew her a kiss.

他朝她咧嘴一笑，送给她一个飞吻。

Shinji looked up at Asuka. She was still cradling him in her arms, blood all over both of them, mud and more blood matting her hair into a snarled rat's nest of filth, and the shredded and now bullet-holed remnants of her Pilot's suit barely visible under all the mess. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. "Yes. Forever yes. I've loved you for ye-"

真嗣抬头望向明日香。她依旧将他紧紧拥在怀中，两人身上沾满了血迹，泥土与更多的血污将她的头发纠结成一团肮脏的乱麻，而那件破烂不堪、布满弹孔的驾驶员服在这一切混乱中几乎难以辨认。然而，在她身上，他看到了此生所见最美的景象。“是的，永远都是。我已爱了你——”

He didn't get any further. Asuka had decided she wanted a kiss right away.

他没能再进一步。明日香已经决定她立刻就要一个吻。

"Ah, it is like looking in a mirror, dear baka," the armored Asuka sighed. "Covered in blood, the place is on fire, and there's an Evangelion smashed in through the ceiling. Just like old times."

“啊，这就像照镜子一样，亲爱的傻瓜，”身着铠甲的明日香叹息道，“血迹斑斑，火光冲天，还有一台被砸穿天花板的福音战士。真是似曾相识啊。”

"We have terrible habits," her husband agreed. "Now, let's get these two back to Avalon for a wash before the blood dries and they end up glued together, since I don't think we're separating them for a while." He shot a look up at Rei. "They'll be back in just a few hours, this side's time, Rei. Trust me. This is their world, and everyone knows it."

"我们确实有糟糕的习惯，"她的丈夫附和道，"现在，让我们把这两个家伙送回阿瓦隆清洗一下，免得血干了他们就粘在一起了，反正我觉得我们暂时不会把他们分开。"他抬头看了看瑞，"他们几个小时后就会回来，按这边的时间算，瑞。相信我。这是他们的世界，大家都知道。"

Rei didn't look happy, but nodded. And vanished.

绫看起来并不高兴，但还是点了点头，然后消失了。

"Captain Soryu-Ayanami, one portal to home, if you please," Captain Ikari-Sohryu said to the air. "Their Majesties want these two back for an audience."

"绫波丽队长，请开启一道回家的传送门，"碇源堂队长对着空气说道，"陛下们希望这两位回去参加觐见。"

A new glowing portal opened up next to the still-kissing couple, and swept over them. When it faded away, the smiling redhead in armor turned to her husband. "So, feel like going to scare the fuck out of an analog of your asshole dad?"

一个新出现的闪光传送门在仍在亲吻的情侣旁展开，将他们笼罩其中。当光芒消散，身着盔甲、面带微笑的红发女子转向她的丈夫。“怎么样，想不想去吓唬一下你那混蛋老爸的平行世界版本？”

"You say the sexiest things, liebling," he replied with a smile. "Lead on, my captain."

“你说的情话最动听，亲爱的，”他微笑着回答，“带路吧，我的船长。”

Their helmets snapped shut and they began to float towards the arm of Unit-01. Asuka shot a look back. "Oh, and have someone pick up that jackass I knocked out. I think our young analogs will want to have a sharp word with him later."

他们的头盔咔哒一声合上，开始向零号机的一侧漂浮过去。明日香回头瞥了一眼。“哦，还有，让人把那个被我打昏的蠢货抬走。我想我们的年轻版们稍后会想跟他好好谈谈。”

Author's Note, 20APR21: A little preface: I began writing A Crown of Stars while on my first Afghanistan deployment. I fell into Eva fics on accident, as a way to kill time. That was 2012. A Throne of Bayonets was great, but... dark. I finished it, sat back, and thought 'You know... Shinji and Asuka deserve a happier ending. ...I'm going to give them one.'

作者附注，2021 年 4 月 20 日：小序：我是在第一次派驻阿富汗期间开始创作《星辰之冠》的。偶然间，我为了消磨时光而接触到了《EVA》同人文，那是在 2012 年。《刀锋王座》虽佳，却颇为阴暗。读完后，我靠在椅背上，心想：“你知道吗……真嗣和明日香值得一个更幸福的结局。……我要为他们编织一个。”

That's where it started. On the way home, my military flight stopped in Kuwait, so we could switch to a civilian charter jet for the rest of the way to the US. I wasn't even a quarter into ACoS by that point, but the ending fight popped into my head, and wouldn't go away. It was good, but I knew I wouldn't need it for a long while. So to save it, I sat down and wrote the whole thing out, from Asuka getting shot onward. That's what you're about to read here. Everything from Jinnai saying "I've got all the power here, Ikari!" was written 7 years ago in the Al Asad Airbase USO, waiting to go home. It's been a long wait, but this is what all of ACoS has been leading to for 4 years. This is nearly a quarter of a million words to see these two have a happier end than AToB left them with.

一切始于归途。军机在科威特暂停，以便我们转乘民用包机飞往美国。那时我连《破晓之影》的四分之一都未读完，但结局的战斗场景却突然浮现脑海，挥之不去。虽精彩，却知久后才需动笔。为珍藏此念，我坐下将整个情节从明日香中枪那一刻起，悉数写下。你即将读到的便是这段文字。从阵内说“我在这里拥有绝对权力，碇！”开始，七年前在阿萨德空军基地的美国援军组织中，我等待归家时所写。漫长的等待终迎此刻，四年间《破晓之影》步步铺垫，汇聚成近二十五万字，只为让这两位主角拥有比《新生之光》更圆满的结局。

I hope you enjoy. 希望你喜欢。

### Chapter 43 A Crown of Stars

The tingle of the portal washed over Asuka in a flash, leaving her and Shinji in the same position they'd just been on their Earth, but now in the middle of the floor of their beach cabin on Avalon. The abrupt transition from the damp-, smoke-, and dust-filled air of Jinnai's command center to the cool, dry air of the Avaloni building was a pleasant shock, as was arriving at the feet of the figure seated on the couch near them.

传送门的刺痛感瞬间席卷了明日香，她和真嗣发现自己仍保持着在地球上的姿势，但此刻已置身于阿瓦隆海滩小屋的地板中央。从阵内指挥中心那潮湿、烟雾和尘埃弥漫的空气中，骤然过渡到阿瓦隆建筑内凉爽干燥的空气，这种转变令人愉悦地一惊，同样让人意外的是，他们竟出现在沙发旁那位坐着的人影脚下。

"I told you you'd feel that way again soon, child. See?" Empress Rayana smiled at them.

“我告诉过你，你很快又会这样感觉的，孩子。看到了吗？”雷亚娜女王对他们微笑着。

"You didn't mention all the shit we'd go through to get there," Asuka growled, still smiling at Shinji. She just couldn't break eye contact. "Or that it was literally true that I'd die before I'd admit out loud I need this baka with me forever."

"你可没提过我们要经历多少破事儿才能到那儿，"明日香低吼着，依旧对着真嗣微笑。她就是无法移开视线。"也没说这绝对是真的——我宁死也不会大声承认我需要这个笨蛋永远陪在我身边。"

"I already knew that," Shinji said tiredly, still smiling back.

"我早就知道了，"真嗣疲惫地说，脸上依旧挂着微笑。

"Shut up, it doesn't count until I say it."

闭嘴，我说了才算数。

"Yes, dear." 是的，亲爱的。

"Learning fast, I see," Rayana said amusedly, rising from the couch. She knelt next to the pair. "And aren't you in a sorry state. Tsk. I'm pleased to see your safety nanites held up. Let's clean up your wounds and his. My my, so many bullet wounds..." She gently laid her hand on Shinji's forehead and Asuka's shoulder.

"学得挺快嘛，" 雷亚娜饶有兴致地说着，从沙发上站起身来。她跪在两人旁边，"瞧你们这副狼狈样。啧啧，还好安全纳米粒子挺管用的。来，给你们俩处理下伤口。哎呀，这么多枪伤……" 她轻柔地把手放在真嗣的额头和明日香的肩上。

A bolt of electricity seemed to shoot along Asuka's nerves, and the closed-up bullet wound on her chest itched weirdly. The sensation passed, and she felt refreshed. Looking down, she watched the just-patched bullet hole in Shinji's leg close up and vanish like it was never there. He gasped and sagged in relieved tension in her arms.

一道电流仿佛沿着明日香的神经疾驰而过，她胸前已经闭合的枪伤奇异地发痒。这感觉转瞬即逝，取而代之的是一阵清爽。她低头望去，只见真嗣腿上刚缝合的弹孔正迅速闭合，消失得无影无踪，仿佛从未存在过。他倒吸一口气，在她的怀抱中松弛下来，带着释然的紧张。

"The nanites would have been good to know about, too," Asuka replied.

"纳米机器人这方面信息也挺有用，" 明日香回答道。

"Would you have done anything differently?" Rayana replied, rising.

"你会不会采取不同的做法？" 雷亚娜回答着，站起身来。

"...no. But knowing I was bulletproof would have been nice," Asuka begrudged. She blinked. "Wait, how do you know any of that?"

"...不，但知道自己是刀枪不入的，那该多好。" 明日香不满地说。她眨了眨眼，"等等，你怎么知道这些的？"

"The moment young Thaddeus arrived back here, we got it all from him. My husband is there now, securing your friends and giving Miss Ayanami a dry look. To help confuse her, he brought along one of her analogs that is a resident here. That ought to shift her thinking a bit, mm?"

小萨德尼斯一回来，我们就从他那里得知了一切。我丈夫现在在那里，确保你的朋友们安全，并对绫波小姐投以干练的目光。为了迷惑她，他还带了一个这里的居民，是她的一个相似者。这应该能稍微改变一下她的想法，嗯？

"Great, more Wondergirls wandering about?"

太好了，又多了些四处游荡的神奇女孩？

"You had an interesting time meeting one of your own, no?" Rayana responded gently. "Now, I may have healed you, but you're still covered in an appalling amount of mud and your own blood, so let's see about cleaning you up before you are literally stuck with each other. I could just snap my fingers for that, but I think you'd rather do it the traditional way, as well as enjoy the time alone together. And before you ask, Asuka, your 'condition' is fine, no ill effects from all this. I checked." She made a small gesture with her left hand and a faint purple nimbus briefly flared around Shinji's body. "There. for the next two minutes, he now temporarily weighs about three kilos."

你遇到了自己的同类，经历挺有趣吧？" 雷亚娜温和地回应道，"现在，我虽然治好了你，但你仍满身泥泞和血迹，令人不忍直视。我们得先帮你清理干净，免得你俩真的黏在一起了。我本可以打个响指就解决，但我想你们更愿意用传统方式，享受这段独处的时光。对了，飞鸟，你的'状况'没问题，这次折腾没留下任何不良影响。我检查过了。" 她左手轻轻一挥，一抹淡紫色的光晕在真嗣身上短暂闪烁。"好了，接下来的两分钟，他的体重会暂时减至三公斤左右。"

"Er, why?" Shinji said. "I'm pretty sure I can walk."

"呃，为什么？" 真嗣说道，"我确信我能走路。"

Rayana flashed a grin. "Maybe, but you're still mostly in Asuka's lap, and I think your fiancée might enjoy the chance to 'bridal carry' you to the shower." At their blush, she laughed. "You do have some things to discuss, mm?" She helped Asuka stand without letting go of Shinji. True to her word, Shinji was no burden at all to lift.

绫波展颜一笑：“或许吧，但你现在大部分还躺在明日香怀里呢，我想你的未婚妻可能会喜欢这个‘新娘抱’你去淋浴的机会。”看到他们脸红，她笑了起来。“你们确实有些事情要商量，嗯？”她帮助明日香站起来，同时没有放开真嗣。正如她所言，真嗣一点也不重，抱起来毫不费力。

"Really, I can walk," he half-protested. He made no real move to free himself from Asuka's arms, however. His arms went right around her neck for stability instead.

"真的，我能走。" 他半是抗议地说。然而，他并没有真正试图从明日香的怀抱中挣脱，反而双手环住了她的脖子以保持稳定。

"Nope, I like you right here," Asuka declared. "Mine," she said more gently, beginning to follow Rayana down the hall from the living room to their bedroom. It felt like years since they'd first slept together there, rather than the two months they'd been trapped on their world.

"不，我就喜欢你在这儿。"明日香宣布道。"我的。"她更温柔地说着，开始跟随蕾安娜从客厅走向他们的卧室。感觉上，自从他们第一次在那里共眠以来，仿佛已经过去了数年，而非仅仅是被困在这个世界的两个月。

Rayana stopped by the bed and waved them past. "You two get cleaned up. We'll look in on you later, but I'm betting you'll need some time. Maybe dinner for your team tonight?"

蕾雅娜停在床边，挥手让他们过去。“你们俩去洗漱一下。我们晚些时候再来看你们，但我猜你们需要点时间。或许今晚给你们的团队准备晚餐？”

"Hikari and the others will be okay, right?"

"光和他们的其他人会没事的，对吧？"

Rayana nodded reassuringly. "Daniel will have them all safe and sound back here shortly. Though we may need to strap Sergeant Bir down to keep him from charging right back in to make sure his platoon is all good. I suppose my husband can just order him to relax, in that case."

蕾安娜肯定地点了点头。“丹尼尔很快就会让他们全都安全无恙地回来。不过我们可能得把伯尔中士绑起来，免得他一回来就冲回去确认他的排是否都安然无恙。我想在这种情况下，我丈夫可以直接命令他放松。”

She dropped a small, square green velvet box in Shinji's lap as they passed. "A little gift you might need." At Shinji and Asuka's paling, she laughed again. "Two starblaze diamond rings, already sized. Congratulations to you both. On both counts."

她经过时，将一个小巧的正方形绿色天鹅绒盒子丢在真嗣的腿上。“或许你需要的小礼物。”看到真嗣和明日香脸色发白，她再次笑了起来。“两枚星辉钻石戒指，已经按尺寸调整好了。祝贺你们俩，两件事都值得庆祝。”

She vanished. 她消失了。

Shinji slowly raised his free hand and pried the box's lid open. Two rings glittered within, gemstones the size of salmon roe glowing faintly in the gold bands. His gaze finally rose to meet hers. "Eep," Shinji observed astutely.

慎二缓缓抬起空着的那只手，小心翼翼地掀开盒盖。两枚戒指静静躺在其中，宝石大小宛如鲑鱼卵，在金色的环托中微微闪烁。他的目光终于抬起，与她相遇。“哎呀，”慎二敏锐地评论道。

Fortunately for them, Asuka's feet kept moving automatically to the bathroom.

幸运的是，明日香的脚自动地带着她走向了浴室。

"Of course, we end up here for this," Asuka said, a wry grin on her lips. She lowered his legs to let him stand right under one of the jets. "Perfect. Start the water, Shinji."

"当然，我们最终还是来了这里，"明日香说着，嘴角勾起一抹苦笑。她放下他的腿，让他正好站在一个喷头下方。"完美。开始放水吧，真嗣。"

"Of course', what?" Shinji said, turning the tap on and starting the powerful spray of hot water from the multiple jet heads. He turned to face Asuka. "...oh."

"当然',什么？" 真嗣说着，打开了水龙头，随即多喷头的热水强劲地喷洒出来。他转过身面对明日香。"...哦。"

Asuka was on one knee the ring box held up to him. "I know I already asked and you already technically answered, but… I want to do it right. Shinji, will you marry me?" The incandescent blush on her face was impressive, but she kept her eyes locked on his.

明日香单膝跪地，将戒指盒举向他。“我知道我已经问过，而你也已经从技术上回答了，但是……我想正式地再问一次。真嗣，你愿意娶我吗？”她脸上那炽热的红晕令人印象深刻，但她的目光始终锁定在他身上。

Shinji put out his left hand. "O-of course!" he said, his voice cracking. "I can never say yes enough!" His hand only shook a little as Asuka slid one of the rings onto his finger. He stared at the glittering stone like he was afraid the ring would start talking out loud. "I can't believe this is really happening."

真嗣伸出左手，声音略带颤抖地说：“当、当然！我怎么也说不够愿意！”当明日香将其中一枚戒指滑入他的手指时，他的手只是微微颤抖。他凝视着那闪烁的宝石，仿佛害怕戒指会突然开口说话。“真不敢相信这真的发生了。”

Asuka stood up carefully, and handed him the other ring to slip onto her finger to match. They fit perfectly.

明日香小心翼翼地站起来，递给他另一枚戒指，让他戴在自己手上与之相配。它们完美契合。

Shinji's eyes got stuck on her chest as they rose back up from her hand. "I-... Asuka, the bullet hole!"

真嗣的目光不由自主地停留在她胸前，从她的手移回时，他惊呼：“我……明日香，是弹孔！”

Her eyes dropped to her own chest. The small, neat circle where she'd been shot had been healed up, but still visible. Now it was gone entirely. "Huh… Thanks, Rayana?" Sha shook her head. "Wait, nope, not getting distracted. Worry about it later. Staying focused on the holy shit you said yes!"

她的目光落在自己的胸前，那个曾经被子弹击中、现已愈合但仍可见的小巧圆圈，如今已完全消失。“哈…谢谢，雷亚娜？”沙摇了摇头，“等等，不行，不能分心。这事以后再担心。现在要紧的是你居然答应了，真是天大的事！”

Shinji gave her an uncertain smile. "Did you ever think I'd say anything else?" The spray from the showerheads haloed him in a cloud of mist. "Asuka, you've owned all of me since…" His smile dimmed as he trailed off.

真嗣给了她一个不确定的微笑。“你以为我会说别的吗？”喷头的水雾在他周围形成了一圈光环。“明日香，自从……以来，你已经拥有了全部的我。”他的笑容随着话音渐弱而黯淡。

"Since the day we met?" she ventured, standing up and stepping closer to take his hand.

"自从我们相遇的那天起？" 她试探着说，站起身来，走近一步握住他的手。

He shook his head. "Since… the beach. The red one. When you put your hand on my face… even after all that had happened, you still showed me someone cared, you cared… That's it. I was completely gone for you then. And ever since."

他摇了摇头。“自从……那片海滩。红色的那片。当你把手放在我脸上的时候……即使经历了那么多，你依然让我感受到有人在乎，你在乎……就是这样。那一刻，我已彻底为你倾倒。从那以后，一直如此。”

He looked down at their hands. "Gods… I….hahahahaha! That's it! I get it now!"

他低头看着他们的手。“天啊……我……哈哈哈哈哈！原来如此！我现在明白了！”

"What?" "什么？"

"'Did you ask him? Or did he ask you?' What the er… 'future Asuka' asked the night we got here. She was talking about...this." Shinji looked up, his smile back full force. "You asked me. And now… that's us, isn't it? In what… three more months, we go back and tell 'ourselves' to go through that portal?"

"'你问过他了吗？还是他问的你？' 那个……'未来的明日香'在我们来这里的那个晚上问的。她指的是……这个。" 真嗣抬起头，笑容再次满溢。"是你问的我。而现在……那就是我们，对吧？再过……三个月，我们回去告诉'我们自己'穿过那个门户？"

"And now we understand why. The ring I was wearing, the way we were acting, this…" She patted her stomach. "Yeah, I guess I can see why we'd mmm… not exactly explain that. Us back then wouldn't have believed it."

现在我们明白了原因。我戴的戒指，我们的举止，还有这个……"她轻拍自己的肚子。"是啊，我想我能理解为什么我们没有……确切地解释这一点。那时的我们肯定不会相信。

The blood and dirt were swiftly washing off them as they stood holding each other in the spray. Asuka happily pulled him closer and burrowed into his arms, nuzzling her face into his neck. "Believe it now, baka Shinji. You're mine. I may have literally had to die before I admit I love you, but I'm never letting go now that I have."

血迹与污垢在喷洒中迅速被冲刷，他们相拥而立。明日香开心地将他拉近，埋首于他的怀抱，脸颊紧贴他的颈项。“现在信了吧，笨蛋真嗣。你是我的。或许我真得经历死亡才肯承认我爱你，但如今我绝不会再放手。”

Shinji only just heard it over the spray. Or maybe felt it from her lips on his skin.

真嗣几乎是在水花声中才听到那声音，又或许是从她贴在他皮肤上的唇间感受到的。

"I promise." 我保证。

"Sergeant Bir?" “比尔中士？”

Bir nodded tense acknowledgement to Lieutenant Liebshott as she ran back into the command pit, but his eyes snapped right back to the comm window in the battle table. "Go ahead, Lieutenant Suzuhara."

比尔紧张地点头回应了列兵利布肖特，随即她跑回了指挥坑，但他的目光立刻又回到了战斗桌上的通讯窗口。“请讲，列兵铃原。”

"I disabled that sub. Punched it right through the reactor, like you said. It started to sink, so I hit it with one of the gravity buoys. It's stuck floating in place about 500m in the air until we want it, I guess. What should I do now?"

我摧毁了那个子舰。就像你说的，直接打穿了反应堆。它开始下沉，于是我用了一个重力浮标击中它。现在它卡在空中大约 500 米处，悬浮不动，直到我们需要它。接下来我该做什么？

Bir smiled slightly and nodded. Touji had had a hard time with the idea of possibly killing a sub full of people, even ones shooting at the city he was defending. Bir had quickly walked him through how to disable it with minimum casualties.

比尔微微一笑，点了点头。对于可能要击沉一艘载满人的潜艇，即使是那些向他所守护的城市开火的人，透二也感到十分纠结。比尔迅速指导他如何以最小伤亡将其瘫痪。

"He, Lieutenant O'Brien, and Unit-01 have landed in Berlin, according to Private Rokobungi's last transmission, so take up a defensive position northeast of the city in case there's any more missiles already en route."

根据罗科邦吉下士的最后通讯，他和奥布赖恩中尉以及 01 单位已降落于柏林，因此请在城市东北方向采取防御姿态，以防有更多导弹已在途中。

He shot a look at Lieutenant Liebshott. She shook her head grimly.

他瞥了利布肖特中尉一眼。她严肃地摇了摇头。

Bir frowned. "And scan the floor of the bay. We still have no sign of Lieutenant Aid-"

比尔皱起眉头。“还要扫描海湾底部。我们仍然没有艾德中尉的任何迹象——”

He froze and stiffened, eyes going wide. "Lord and Lady…"

他僵住了，身体绷紧，眼睛瞪得大大的。“天啊……”

Ching's face nearly matched his own. "Oh… oh! So… so that's what that feels like!"

青的脸几乎和他的脸一样。“哦……哦！原来……原来这就是那种感觉！”

Bir's eyes closed slowly and his shoulders relaxed for the first time in two months. "The Emperor protects," he said quietly.

比尔的双眼缓缓闭上，两个月来他的肩膀第一次放松下来。“皇帝庇佑。”他轻声说道。

"No sparrow shall fall, Sergeant. Good work," Daniel said from just behind him. The Emperor stepped up next to the NCO and clapped a hand on his shoulder. "Very good work."

"麻雀不会坠落，中士。干得好，"丹尼尔从他身后不远处说道。皇帝走到军士旁边，拍了拍他的肩膀。"非常出色的工作。"

The battle table lit up with a sudden glow of scores of new icons, then doubled, then tripled.

战况桌上突然亮起数十个新图标的光芒，随后数量翻倍，接着又翻了三倍。

"I 'shimmed the door open' so Miss Ayanami can't lock us out again before the entire rest of the 791st Independent Division lands. The Soryu is already in orbit, as well. And all of your short company is getting rotated home tout d'suite. You've got some leave coming."

"我'把门滑开'了，这样绫波小姐就不能在我们 791 独立师其余人员全部降落前再次把我们锁在外面。Soryu 号也已经进入轨道。你们这支小部队马上就要轮换回家了。你还有假期等着呢。"

"Your Majesty, can you see Lieutenant Aida? He's MIA," Liebshott asked.

陛下，您能看到艾达中尉吗？他失踪了，”利布肖特问道。

Daniel looked at the wall, in the direction of the riverfront. "Mmm. His mecha's a wreck, but the stasis systems on the cockpit are active. Some of the 791st will recover him." He made a small gesture. On the battle table, two icons swung out over the water.

丹尼尔望向河岸方向的墙壁，沉吟道：“嗯，他的机甲已经破损不堪，但驾驶舱的静滞系统还在运作。791 部队的一些人会去救他。”他轻轻一挥手，战斗桌上的两个图标随即划过水面。

Bir let a tired smile onto his face. "I stand relieved, Sire."

比尔让一个疲惫的微笑爬上脸庞。“我感到如释重负，陛下。”

"I bet you are." 我敢打赌你是。

"I take it our commanders and wayward prince were successful in Berlin, Sire? What happened?"

看来我们的指挥官和任性王子在柏林取得了成功，陛下？发生了什么事？

Daniel cocked his head. "My other half is taking care of them now back home. Seems they managed to convince Miss Ayanami to drop the block by Lieutenant Soryu proposing to her beau."

丹尼尔歪了歪头。“我的另一半现在在家照顾他们。看来他们设法说服绫波小姐在苏里中尉向她的心上人求婚后撤掉了封锁。”

Ching grinned at Bir. "So it was her. Looks like I owe you a beer."

青对伯笑了笑。“看来是她了。看来我欠你一杯啤酒。”

Bir snorted. "Always bet on a redhead to make the impulsive winning move, told ya."

比尔哼了一声：“早就告诉过你，总是要押注红发人会做出冲动的制胜之举。”

"Now, to have a word with our local Lilith," Daniel said, shaking his head.

"现在，得跟我们这儿的莉莉丝谈谈了。" 丹尼尔摇着头说。

"I do not require lectures from you," the former First Child said coldly from the side, appearing without a sound. "I have already had to endure the Second Child twice over at the same time today."

"我不需要你来教训我，"前任第一子冷冷地从一旁出现，悄无声息。"今天我已经不得不同时忍受第二子两次了。"

"How terrible," Daniel said dryly. "Still, may we talk for a bit? Your friends will be returning in a few days at most, and likely will want to talk to you. Well, Shinji will, anyway."

"真糟糕，"丹尼尔干巴巴地说道，"不过，我们能聊一会儿吗？你的朋友们最多几天就会回来，他们很可能会想和你谈谈。嗯，至少真嗣会。"

Rei gave him a flat stare. "Fine. Proceed."

丽给他一个平淡的眼神。“好吧。继续。”

"Mmmm… vas…" The redheaded woman on the bed stirred and blinked her eyes slowly open. She stared blankly at the ceiling for a second, then went wide. She suddenly sat fully upright, eyes darting around. "Asuka! Wo ist Asuka‽" ["Asuka! Where's Asuka!" I…"]

"嗯……这里……" 床上的红发女子动了动，缓缓睁开双眼。她茫然地盯着天花板片刻，随即瞳孔放大。她猛地坐直，目光四处扫视。"明日香！明日香在哪里！"

The strangeness of her surroundings began to register. The panoramic view out the window of a tropical evening sunset was not the hospital setting she seemed to expect. The tall woman in green and black robes sitting at her bedside was not disturbed. "Guten Abend, Doktor Sōryū. Ich fürchte, Sie haben eine Weile geschlafen. Mehr ein Koma, eigentlich. Was ist das Letzte, woran Sie sich erinnern?" "[Good evening, Doctor Soryu. I'm afraid you've been asleep for awhile. Something like a coma, really. What is the last thing you remember?"]

四周的异样开始引起她的注意。窗外的热带黄昏日落全景，并非她所预期的医院景象。坐在床边那位身着绿黑长袍的高挑女子并未显露惊慌。“晚上好，空竜医生。恐怕您已经睡了很久，近乎昏迷。您还记得的最后一件事是什么？”

Kyoko rubbed her head and shook her head slightly. "Ich... bin nicht sicher. Asuka war da, und wir... haben gegen jemanden gekämpft? Weiße und rote... Gestalten? Wir... haben verloren? Ich erinnere mich an Schmerzen in meinem Auge..." ["I… it's not clear. Asuka was there, and we were… fighting someone? Figures in white and red? We…. we lost? I remember pain in my eye…"] She reached up to touch her face. "Aber auch einen... einen Prozess? Männer mit Waffen, die mich von ihr wegzerren?" ["But also a...a trial? Men with guns dragging me away from her?"] She looked around. "Und... Wo bin ich? Wer sind Sie?" ["And… where am I? Who are you?"]

京子揉了揉头，轻轻摇了摇头。“我……不太确定。明日香在那里，我们……在和某人战斗？白色和红色的身影？我们……输了？我记得眼睛里的疼痛……”她伸手触摸自己的脸。“但还有一个……一个审判？持枪的男人，将我从她身边拖走？”她环顾四周。“还有……我在哪儿？您是谁？”

"Mein Name ist Rayana. Ich bin sozusagen ihre Gastgeberin und dies hier ist eine Art Reha-Klinik beziehungsweise Kurheim auf den Sternbildinseln der Welt Avalon." ["My name is Rayana. I am your hostess, essentially. This is a recuperation facility slash resort in the Constellation Islands on the world of Avalon."] At Kyoko's look of confusion, Rayana gestured at the other side of the bed where two more people waited with nervous expressions. "Ich bin nur zur Unterstützung hier. Ich denke, Sie würden es eher begrüßen, wenn Ihre Tochter die weiteren Erklärungen übernimmt." ["I am here merely for support. She will explain everything from here. I think you'd prefer your daughter do so in any case."]

我叫雷亚娜，算是您的东道主。这里是阿瓦隆世界中星座群岛上的一个康复中心兼度假村。看到京子一脸困惑，雷亚娜指了指床的另一侧，那里还有两个人带着紧张的表情等待着。我在这里只是提供支持。我想您会更愿意由您的女儿来继续解释接下来的事情。

Kyoko rolled her head over to her right as quickly as her fatigued body could manage.

京子竭尽疲惫之躯所能，迅速将头转向右侧。

A young woman with a very familiar shade of red hair smiled nervously at her, tightly clutching her companion's hand for support. "Hallo, mama…"

一位红发颜色极为熟悉的年轻女子紧张地朝她微笑，紧紧握着同伴的手以寻求支持。“你好，妈妈……”

Kyoko's eyes widened. This woman had to be at least 20. "Meine... Tochter? Asuka? Bist du das?" ["My… daughter? Asuka? Is that you?"]

恭子的眼睛睁大了。这位女士至少有二十岁。“我的…女儿？明日香？是你吗？”

"Ja, Mama. Ich bin's." ["Yes, mama. It's me."] Asuka raised Shinji's hand with her. The ring on his left hand glittered. "Und das ist mein Verlobter, Shinji. Willkommen zurück." ["And this is my fiancé, Shinji. Welcome back."]

"是的，妈妈。是我。" 明日香举起真嗣的手，他左手上的戒指闪闪发光。"这位是我的未婚夫，真嗣。欢迎回来。"

"Time travel?" Kyoko shook her head. "Kitten dear, that may be the oddest thing yet. Two months of giant robots, rings in the sky, this being another world, and gods and goddesses just dropping by to say 'good day!'... and my nurse is a woman with blue hair that looks like an elf! But now you say you and your Verlobter have 'to do a little time travel' before the party tonight?"

"时间旅行？"京子摇了摇头，"小猫咪，这可能是迄今为止最奇怪的事情了。两个月来，巨型机器人、天上的光环、这个世界的存在，还有神明们随意来访说声'日安'……而我的护士竟然是一个蓝发、看起来像精灵的女人！现在你却说你和你的未婚夫'在今晚的派对前得进行一次时间旅行'？"

Asuka grinned. "Yes, Mama. I knew it was close as soon as Shinji found that dress in the video catalogue. And he and I knew this was coming, since that's how it started. I don't think we'd have trusted anyone else enough to follow them through the portal to here, no? I barely trusted myself." She laughed. "Ok, I admit some of it was spite and curiosity at seeing this." She raised her left hand and wiggled her fingers. The ring sparkled and gave off a faint glow. "And now I get to twit 'myself' with all the jokes I made. Now I find them very funny. Not so much then."

明日香咧嘴一笑：“是的，妈妈。当真嗣在视频目录里找到那条裙子时，我就知道事情不简单了。他和我也预感到会有这一天，毕竟一切就是那么开始的。我想，我们不会轻易信任任何人，跟着他们穿过那扇门来到这里，对吧？我自己都差点没信心。”她笑了起来，“好吧，我承认，其中一部分是出于怨念和好奇，想看看这一切。”她举起左手，摆动着手指，戒指闪烁着微弱的光芒，“现在我可以拿自己开涮，用我以前开的那些玩笑了。现在我觉得它们很有趣，当时可不这么认为。”

Shinji knocked on the doorframe of Kyoko's room before entering, followed by Mother Sriyana. The priestess just nodded to Asuka, and busied herself examining the small holoscreen readouts hovering near the head of Kyoko's bed. Shinji smiled at Asuka. "Good afternoon, Doctor. Hallo, love. Kensuke, Katya, and Kimatra send their best wishes. They'll see us at the party." His German still had a bit of an accent.

真嗣在进入绫波的房间前轻敲了门框，斯里亚纳母亲紧随其后。女祭司只是向明日香点了点头，便忙于检查悬浮在绫波床头的微型全息屏幕读数。真嗣对明日香微笑道：“下午好，博士。你好，亲爱的。健介、卡佳和基马特拉送上他们的祝福。他们会在派对上见我们。”他的德语仍带有些许口音。

Asuka only briefly rolled her eyes. "Kimatra still trying to convince the other two 'now' is a good time to get married, I take it?"

明日香只是短暂地翻了个白眼。“我猜，基马特拉还在试图说服另外两人，现在是个结婚的好时机？”

"Kensuke's eyes do tend to glaze over in a happy way when she mentions it, at least?" Shinji offered. "Er… Rei says 'Hallo' as well," he continued more awkwardly.

“至少，当她提起这事时，肯介的眼神确实会幸福地变得有些迷离吧？”真嗣试探着说。“呃……绫波也说了‘你好’，”他接着更加尴尬地补充道。

Asuka tried not to frown. She really did. Kensuke, Touji, Hikari, and their families were still on Earth, continuing to help out with the still accelerating Avalon-backed reconstruction efforts. The portal to and from their world had never been interfered with again by their former-colleague-now-goddess, and she and Asuka had even managed to have a few civil conversations over the last couple months, but there was still little love lost between them. With Shinji mediating, they were both making efforts to bury things, though. "Mmm… she knows we're coming to visit tonight, back six months, yes?"

明日香努力不皱眉。她确实如此。真嗣、东治、光以及他们的家人仍在地球上，继续协助阿瓦隆支持的重建工作，这些工作仍在加速进行。通往他们世界的门户再也没有被他们曾经的同事——现在的女神——干扰过，她和明日香甚至在过去的几个月里设法进行了几次文明的对话，但她们之间仍然缺乏深厚的感情。在真嗣的调解下，她们都在努力埋藏过去。“嗯……她知道我们今晚要回去六个月前拜访，对吧？”

He nodded. "She said she won't bother us, since she knows it ends well."

他点头道：“她说她不会打扰我们，因为她知道结局是好的。”

Asuka sighed. "I suppose that's why she didn't pester us back then. Is it about time? Alright…"

明日香叹了口气。“我想这就是她当时没有纠缠我们的原因。是时候了吗？好吧……”

She stood up, a trifle more awkwardly than she would have six months ago. She gave her belly an automatic pat as she straightened. "Oof. I swear, they're doubling in weight each week."

她站起身来，比六个月前略显笨拙。她一边挺直身子，一边下意识地轻拍了拍肚子。“哎呀，我发誓，他们每周体重都在翻倍。”

Shinji had practically teleported to her side as she rose, his hand already gently massaging at her lower back. "Two on two, but I still feel like we'll be outnumbered."

她刚一起身，真嗣几乎瞬间就出现在她身边，手已轻柔地在她后腰按摩起来。“二对二，但我总觉得我们还是会被压倒。”

"Hah. Twins? We're going to be dead meat." Rayana had given them the word a week past, when Asuka couldn't stand the curiosity any longer. Fraternal twins were coming right at them, a boy and a girl. They were still too amazed to even contemplate names yet.

哈哈，双胞胎？我们这下可要完蛋了。"一周前，当飞鸟再也抑制不住好奇心时，瑞安娜告诉了他们这个消息。一对异卵双胞胎正向他们走来，一个男孩和一个女孩。他们还沉浸在震惊中，连名字都还没来得及考虑。

"I'm sure I still remember how to feed a bottle to a baby, my dear," Kyoko said with a smile, breaking off her muttered consultation with the priestess. "You will be fine. I will spoil my grandchildren thoroughly." She snorted. "And I'm sure you will be back in time for the party, yes?"

"亲爱的，我肯定还记得怎么给婴儿喂奶瓶，"京子微笑着说，打断了与女祭司的低声商讨。"你会没事的。我会好好宠溺我的孙辈。"她哼了一声。"而且我确信你会及时回来参加派对的，对吧？"

"Of course!" Asuka said cheerily. "'Gott mit uns', no? We'll be there. Everyone's coming, so we can't be late." She gave her mother a wave as they headed out the door.

"当然啦！"明日香欢快地说道，"'上帝与我们同在'，对吧？我们会到的。大家都来，所以我们可不能迟到。"她向母亲挥了挥手，随即走出了门。

The beach outside was nicely warm, Primastra already kissing the horizon in a glorious sunset. Daniel was already waiting for them at the shoreline. "Ready to give yourselves the kick in the pants to get started?" He smiled.

外面的海滩温暖宜人，普里玛斯特拉已亲吻着地平线，上演着壮丽的日落。丹尼尔已经在岸边等候他们。“准备好给自己一脚，开始行动了吗？”他微笑着问道。

"Should I worry about remembering exactly what I said the first time?" Shinji asked, slightly concerned.

"我需要担心记住我第一次说的每一个字吗？" 真嗣问道，略带忧虑。

"Not at all. Just say what comes to mind. It will be what you remember." He clapped his hands together twice, and a pale gray portal split the air to their right and irised open. "Step through here, and you'll be back six months to the night you arrived. I'll be waiting. Then I'll open the gate to your Earth, and go through first to 'introduce' you. You talk yourselves through the portal, leave your past selves with me, and come right back here. You've got a party to attend, of course."

一点也不难。想到什么就说什么，那将是你记得的内容。"他拍了两下手，一个淡灰色的传送门在他们右侧裂开空气，如虹膜般展开。"穿过这里，你就会回到六个月前你到达的那个夜晚。我会等着你。然后我会打开通往你地球的门，先过去'介绍'你。你们自己通过传送门交谈，把过去的自己留给我，然后直接回到这里。你当然还有一场派对要参加。"

Asuka shook her head. "God, this is going to be fun. Shinji, I swear, you have no idea how much 'did he ask you? Or did you ask him?' baked my brain. I could not deal with the implications of that for a while. Messed with me even more than the ring or the belly, to be honest."

明日香摇了摇头。“天啊，这可真有意思。真嗣，我发誓，你根本不知道‘是他问你的吗？还是你问他的？’这句话让我脑子有多乱。我有一阵子完全应付不了这背后的含义。说实话，这比戒指或肚子的事还让我心烦。”

"'Be you later', I said. Guess I am now?" Shinji replied. He took her hand and they stepped into the portal.

"你迟到了",我说。"猜我现在是了？"真嗣回答。他牵起她的手，两人一同踏入传送门。

Daniel was already standing on the other side, in the now moonlit early night. "And right on schedule. Alright, hold on a moment, kids, and we'll get you face to face with your sad old selves. Just tell them what happiness awaits on this end, and walk them through."

丹尼尔已经站在另一边，此刻月光初照的夜幕下。"而且正好准时。好了，孩子们，稍等片刻，我们就能让你们与悲伤的旧自己面对面。只需告诉他们这边等待着怎样的幸福，然后引导他们走过。"

They nodded, and he snapped his fingers. The portal looked like a black pool of ink standing on its side. Daniel took one last look back at them. "Just wait for my wave, then come through." He stepped into the portal and vanished.

他们点头示意，他打了个响指。那传送门宛如竖立的墨池，漆黑一片。丹尼尔回头望了他们最后一眼，“等我挥手，你们就过来。”他迈入传送门，身影随即消失。

Asuka automatically took Shinji's hand as they stood waiting. She laughed nervously. "No wonder we looked so tense when 'we' showed up, eh? This is going to be so weird."

阿苏卡不自觉地握住了真嗣的手，两人站在那里等待着。她紧张地笑了笑，“难怪我们出现时看起来那么紧张，对吧？这感觉真是太奇怪了。”

"At least we know it has a good end?" Shinji smiled weakly. His eyes dropped to her growing belly. "I can't believe I'm about to make jokes at 'myself' when I ask about this."

"至少我们知道它有一个美好的结局吧？" 真嗣苦笑着说。他的目光落在她日渐隆起的腹部上。"真不敢相信，当我问起这件事时，我竟然要拿'自己'开玩笑。"

"Just what a baka needs to get moving, love," Asuka grinned.

"这就是个笨蛋需要的动力，爱，" 明日香咧嘴笑道。

Daniel's hand emerged from the portal and gestured for them to follow.

丹尼尔的手从传送门中伸出，示意他们跟随。

Shinji cocked his head at Asuka as they came back out of the portal from their Earth. "You were right. That was as weird as we expected."

真嗣侧头看着从地球的传送门回来的明日香，说道：“你是对的，那确实和我们预想的一样奇怪。”

Asuka glanced back over her shoulder at the pair following them. That Asuka was stunned, staring up at the blazing night sky. She shook her head at her younger self's expression. "God, I looked so small and… scared. It feels like another world."

明日香回头瞥了一眼跟在后面的两人。那个明日香震惊地仰望着烈焰般的夜空。她对着年幼自己的表情摇了摇头。“天啊，我看起来那么渺小，而且……害怕。感觉像是另一个世界。”

They swiftly walked down the beach a bit, to put some space between them and their counterparts. Daniel was already waiting next to where the second portal to their own 'present' would open. Daniel raised his hand and a pale grey disk flared in the air before them. He smiled. "And now you know why I didn't mention some things right away, eh?"

他们迅速沿着海滩走了一段，以拉开与对方之间的距离。丹尼尔已经在第二个通往他们自己“现在”的传送门即将开启的地方等候。丹尼尔举起手，一个苍白的灰色圆盘在他们面前闪耀。他微笑着说：“现在你知道为什么我没有立刻提及某些事情了吧？”

Asuka wiggled her head in acknowledgement. "Ok, yes, messing with myself was fun, and did get me thinking about 'certain things' in a way I would have mentally veered away from automatically if not. Still feels weird, a bit."

明日香点头表示同意。“好吧，是的，捉弄自己确实挺有趣，也让我以一种如果不是这样就会本能避开的方式思考了‘某些事情’。还是感觉有点怪怪的。”

Shinji snorted. "Love, if we had told our younger selves half of what we've done, they'd have panicked. Just us wearing the rings alone…"

真嗣哼了一声。“爱情，如果我们告诉年轻的自己我们做过的哪怕一半事情，他们都会惊慌失措。光是我们戴着这些戒指……”

"Speaking of which…" Asuka turned back down the beach to their past selves. "Oy! We're going back up to when we're supposed to be. There's a party waiting on us! You have fun. And try this one out, 'me'; did he ask you? Or did you ask him?" she shouted.

"说到这个…" 明日香转身望向海滩上过去的他们。"喂！我们要回到该回去的时候了。还有一场派对在等着我们呢！你玩得开心点。试试这个，'我'；是他问的你吗？还是你问的他？" 她大声喊道。

Shinji waved to himself, too. "Remember, you can change things. Take the chance! 'Be' you later!"

真嗣也向自己挥了挥手，“记住，你可以改变一切。抓住机会！待会儿见！”

Daniel gave them a small grin. "See? Fun. See you both later. Have a good time at this party."

丹尼尔对他们露出了一个浅浅的微笑。“看到了吗？很有趣的。待会儿见。祝你们在这个派对上玩得开心。”

The cool sensation of the portal washed over them as they stepped through, and then it was now again.

穿越之时，传送门的清凉感笼罩着他们，转眼间，一切又回到了当下。

Asuka looked at Shinji. "So… party time?"

明日香看着真嗣。“那么…派对时间？”

"Let's go." 我们走吧。

Asuka blinked at her friend. Her fiancé blinked too. "You're getting what?!"

明日香眨了眨眼看着她的朋友。她的未婚夫也眨了眨眼。“你要得到什么？！”

"Married," Ching grinned. "It's just a five year trial contract. Since a lot of us are functionally immortal, we don't just dive into a ''till death do us part' permanent deal. But we've decided since we kind of like each other a bit, we'd try it out for a bit."

"结婚了，"青笑着说，"不过是个五年试用期合同。既然我们很多人实际上是不朽的，就不会轻易跳进'至死不渝'的永久关系。但我们觉得彼此还算合得来，就决定先试试看。"

Asuka and Shinji shared a look for a moment, then returned to a dual 'wut' at their older friends. "Can… can you just… do that?" Shinji asked.

明日香和真嗣对视了一瞬，随即双双对年长的朋友们露出困惑的表情。“你…你们真的可以…那样做吗？”真嗣问道。

"We're both theoretically sufficiently mature and cognizant adults," Bir said with a slight smirk at Ching, "and yes, we can do that if we want to. As a bonus, the Lord and Lady themselves said… ah…"

"我们俩理论上都足够成熟，是明事理的成年人，"比尔对青露出了一丝微笑，"没错，如果我们愿意，是可以那么做的。而且，主神和女神他们自己也曾说过……呃……"

"'Sure, it'll be hilarious for the Army-Navy jokes alone,' is what she said," Ching completed. "And His Lordship said 'you two will be fine, and happy.' And who can resist a blessing like that? Also, Dalren is cute and I like him." She punctuated her assessment with a peck to his cheek.

"当然，光是陆军海军的笑话就够搞笑的了，" 青补充道，"而他的老爷说'你们俩会没事的，会幸福的。' 谁能抗拒这样的祝福呢？再说，达伦挺可爱的，我喜欢他。" 她边说边在他脸颊上亲了一口，为自己的评价画上了句号。

The party was in full swing. Misato and Ryouji's baby shower, that is. Misato had finally thought to ask for a check herself, and Doc Leibshott had been only too happy to confirm the former NERV Operations Manager was indeed in a family way. Asuka hadn't stopped laughing at her for days, in between congratulations.

派对正热闹非凡，这是为碇真嗣和铃原东治的宝宝举办的迎婴派对。碇真嗣终于想到自己去做了个检查，而莱布施特医生非常乐意地确认了这位前 NERV 作战部长的确怀孕了。明日香在祝贺之余，已经连续几天笑个不停。

She had been only too pleased to inform Rayana. The Empress had decreed it a good excuse for a celebration and party for the rescuees from their operation, a good chance for those still working on their Earth to return for an evening of rest and mingling with those no longer on constant duty there.

她非常乐意将这一消息告知瑞安娜。皇后已下令，这正是为那些从行动中获救者举办庆祝派对的好借口，也是那些仍在地球上工作的人们回来享受一个晚上的休息与交流的好机会，与那些不再全天候驻守那里的人相聚。

Which had led them back to the party they'd always sort of known they'd attend the night this all 'started' for them. If you'd asked Shinji at any point before this, he'd probably have agreed it shouldn't be a surprise. And while the party itself might not have been, a lot of the content had turned out to be.

这让他们回到了那个派对，那个他们一直隐约觉得会在这一切“开始”之夜参加的派对。如果在这之前问真嗣，他可能也会同意，这本不该令人惊讶。尽管派对本身可能并不出人意料，但其中的许多内容却出乎意料。

Kensuke appearing on the arms of both Kimatra and Katya with a slightly dazed look had been expected, though not the matching look on theirs. "She… agreed. And… we agreed, and... I think we're ok?"

肯斯克出现在基马特拉和卡佳的臂弯中，带着些许茫然的神情，这在意料之中，但两人脸上相同的表情却出乎意料。“她……同意了。而且……我们也都同意了，然后……我觉得我们应该没事了？”

"Agreed to what, Ken-man?" Touji had prodded, his arm around Hikari.

"同意了什么，健人？" 冬二追问道，手臂环着光。

She had nodded beside him. "You didn't get married, did you? That would be just a little wild at our age and your short time together."

她在他身边点了点头。“你没有结婚，对吧？在我们这个年纪，以及你们短暂的相处时间里，那未免太疯狂了。”

Asuka gave her a look.

明日香看了她一眼。

"What?" she rebutted. "Not everyone is as crazy as you two, Asuka. And even you two waited a good while."

"什么？"她反驳道，"并不是每个人都像你们俩这么疯狂，明日香。而且你们俩也等了挺久的。"

"Mostly because I was a nearly psychotic ball of trauma, and he was a neurotic mess of regrets," Asuka drolled. "But spill, nerd-Stooge. What's got all three of you looking like stunned gophers?"

"多半是因为我是个几乎精神错乱的创伤球，而他是个神经质的悔恨堆，"明日香拖着长音说道，"不过快说吧，书呆子。是什么让你们三个看起来像被吓呆的地鼠？"

"We… have options. On each other." At their confused looks, Kensuke looked helplessly at Katya.

"我们…有选择。在彼此之间。" 面对他们困惑的表情，健介无奈地看向卡佳。

The Russian girl snapped out of her daze long enough to explain. "Ah, we… are not getting married. At the moment. More or less." Her Japanese was now as smooth as Shinji's German. "None of us will ask anyone for at least three years, and then we each get first ask. Mutually."

俄罗斯女孩从恍惚中回过神来，解释道：“啊，我们……目前不结婚。或多或少是这样。”她的日语现在和真嗣的德语一样流利。“我们中没有人会在至少三年内向任何人求婚，然后我们各自享有优先求婚权。这是相互的。”

She got more confused looks. She pouted slightly. "What? I was in school to learn how to do accounting and finance for my family's business. It makes sense to us and is a compromise with Kimatra's desire for 'tomorrow or sooner'." She shot a tiny smirk at her second partner.

她收到了更多困惑的目光。她微微撅起嘴：“怎么了？我去学校是为了学习如何处理家族企业的会计和财务。这对我们来说很合理，也是与 Kimatra 希望‘明天或更早’的愿望做出的妥协。”她向她的第二位合作伙伴投去了一个小小的坏笑。

"Kensuke insisted he wasn't ready and didn't want to rush in. I am willing to wait for you both," the Indian girl noted crisply. "I know who I want, and am patient."

“健介坚持说他还没准备好，不想急于求成。我愿意等你们俩，”那位印度女孩干脆地说，“我知道我想要谁，我有耐心。”

"And modest," Katya snarked back.

"还挺谦虚的，"卡佳反讽道。

"I will seduce you too, Russki," the brunette said calmly. "Resistance is futile."

"我也会诱惑你，俄罗斯人，" 棕发女子平静地说，"抵抗是徒劳的。"

Kensuke let out a snort and pulled them away to the dance floor, waving a farewell at Shinji and Asuka.

健介哼了一声，拉着他们走向舞池，向真嗣和明日香挥手告别。

Asuka shook her head again. "This place is weird. I'd swear there's something in the water, but those three have been spending their time on our Earth, so it must be in the air."

明日香再次摇了摇头。“这个地方真诡异。我敢肯定水里有什么东西，但他们三个一直在我们的地球上，所以一定是空气里有什么。”

"I can't complain," Shinji said with a small smile.

"我没什么可抱怨的，" 真嗣带着一丝微笑说道。

"Well, of course not, you get to swan about on the arm of the most kick-ass Pilot in the world," Asuka said airily. "I do approve of how many redheads this place has. It feels-"

"嗯，当然不是，你可以挽着世界上最厉害的飞行员到处炫耀，"明日香轻松地说道，"我确实喜欢这里红发的人很多。感觉上——"

A petite hand with cold fingers touched her shoulder.

一只小巧冰凉的手指触碰了她的肩膀。

Asuka stiffened and whirled around.

明日香身体一僵，猛地转过身来。

Rei Ayanami stared flatly at her.

绫波丽面无表情地盯着她。

Silence held amid the chattering crowd of the party. The atmosphere of the tropical beach pavilion suddenly felt chilly. Shinji nervously darted between the two women. "Ah…"

在派对上喧闹的人群中，沉默突然降临。热带海滩凉亭的气氛骤然变得寒意袭人。真嗣紧张地在两位女士之间来回穿梭。“啊……”

"First things first: Are you the Rei from our world?" Asuka suddenly began. "I've learned to ask around here."

首先，你是我们世界的绫波吗？"明日香突然发问，"我在这里已经学会先打听了。

"Yes. Greetings, Soryu-san, Ikari-kun. Your," Rei's lips pursed, "older friend convinced me this 'party' was a good moment to… apologize." She gave off the air of someone shuffling their feet while standing perfectly still.

是的。你们好，惣流小姐，碇君。你们的那位，”绫波的嘴唇微微抿紧，“年长的朋友说服我，这场‘聚会’是个好时机来……道歉。”她虽然站得笔直，却给人一种局促不安的感觉。

Asuka stared right back at her. "I am twenty percent convinced you're a different Rei Ayanami trying to pull off a bit. But I'll bite. An apology?"

明日香直视着她。“我有百分之二十相信你是另一个绫波丽，正在演一出戏。但我愿意上钩。道歉？”

"I allowed my mortal animosity towards you to overly color my actions, when I should have been more detached and dispassionate. I had the souls of most of humanity under my sight, and evidently had not learned to separate my own feelings for Shinji and antipathy for you despite having the breadth of all hearts to watch and learn from." She shifted her feet, managing for the first time to look awkward more than icily remote. "In my defense, you were still…"

我任由对你的凡人敌意过分影响我的行为，本应保持更为超然和冷静。我曾目睹大多数人类的灵魂，显然未能学会在观察并学习所有心灵的广度时，将我对真嗣的感情与对你的反感区分开来。”她挪动脚步，首次显得尴尬而非冷漠疏离。“在为自己辩护时，你仍是……”

"'Being a raging bitch'?" Asuka suggested, one corner of her mouth curling up.

"‘当个泼妇’？" 明日香提议道，嘴角勾起一丝笑意。

"Acting overtly quite hostile to Shinji, I was going to say," Rei concluded.

“对真嗣表现得相当敌意，我正要说，”绫波总结道。

"Fine, I'll say that part: I was a bitch. A terrified, arrogant, barely functional bitch. So… almost as bad as you," Asuka grinned.

"好吧，我承认那部分：我是个贱人。一个恐惧、傲慢、几乎无法正常运作的贱人。所以……几乎和你一样糟糕，"明日香咧嘴笑道。

Rei's eyes narrowed. "Daniel warned me you would try to provoke me. And vice versa."

零的眼神变得锐利。“丹尼尔警告过我，你会试图激怒我。反之亦然。”

"Is it working? I've still got plenty of negative feelings about you to work out."

"这招奏效了吗？我对你还有一大堆负面情绪需要宣泄呢。"

"No, because I am smarter than… that, and will control myself."

不，因为我比那更聪明，我会控制自己。

Asuka's grin sharpened. "You were about to say 'you', weren't you?"

明日香的笑容变得锐利起来。“你刚才是想说‘你’，对吧？”

Rei stared at her, silent.

零默默地凝视着她。

Asuka's smile didn't diminish. It did gain a sharp curl on one side. "Fuck you too, bitch. You're still going to be family, so… truce? I'll love and hold this baka for as long as we live, and you and I get along?"

明日香的笑容并未消减，一侧嘴角反而勾起了一抹锐利的弧度。“你也是，贱人。我们终究还是一家人，所以……休战如何？只要我们活着，我就会一直爱着这个笨蛋，你和我能和睦相处吗？”

Rei stared for another moment. "That is… acceptable. If you fail or leave him alone, I will not only take him to protect him myself, I will stuff your soul into a gerbil as well."

绫又凝视了一会儿，说道：“那……可以接受。如果你失败或弃他不顾，我不仅会亲自保护他，还会把你的灵魂塞进一只沙鼠里。”

"I would expect nothing less," Asuka smiled, taking Shinji's hand.

"我当然不会期待更少，" 明日香微笑着，握住了真嗣的手。

"Do I get a vote in this?" Shinji asked dryly. He just grinned when Asuka stuck her tongue out at him.

"我在这事儿上有发言权吗？" 真嗣干巴巴地问道。当明日香朝他吐舌头时，他只是咧嘴一笑。

"Also, I have peace offerings," Rei continued.

"另外，我还带来了平安祭。" 礼继续说道。

"Eh?" "嗯？"

"I will endeavor to incarnate Kaworu Nagisa, and separate him from my awareness, and... I will discorporate 'Don Barcelo' and Jinnai and keep them under reformatory supervision for a few decades at minimum."

我将尽力具象化渚薰，并将其从我的意识中分离，同时……我将解散“唐·巴塞洛”和阵内，并让他们接受至少几十年的改造监管。

Shinji's eyes widened. "You'll-... Rei, I…" He looked at Asuka, then back to the bluenette. "I don't know what to say. Thank you?"

真嗣的眼睛睁大了。“你——... 绫波，我…”他看向明日香，然后又回望蓝发少女。“我不知道该说什么好。谢谢你？”

Asuka opened her mouth to reflexively argue or make a counter-offer, but stopped. "I... thank you, Wond-... Rei. That's… quite an offer. On both parts."

明日香本想本能地反驳或提出还价，却止住了。“我……谢谢你，万德……不，丽。这……真是相当慷慨的提议。双方都是。”

Rei almost glared at her, somehow without changing expression. "...I expected you to argue," she admitted. "Or worse."

丽几乎是在瞪着她，却奇妙地没有改变表情。“……我本以为你会争辩，”她承认道，“或者更糟。”

"This baka has been a bad influence on me."

这个笨蛋对我影响很坏。

"You mean a good influence, correct?"

"你的意思是积极的影响，对吧？"

"Whichever." 随便。

Rei's non-expression did not shift. "..."

绫的表情没有丝毫变化。“……”

Asuka relented. "Ok, fine, I'm being serious. It's a… really kind offer, Rei, and will make him happy. And at this point, yes, I'd chew off a leg for that alone. If you can take those assholes off to ...I don't know, spiritual prison for us, that will be a load off both our minds, and getting to see the Fifth Child again will be a bonus. So yes, I mean that 'thank you'."

明日香终于松口了：“好吧，我认真说。这真是个……非常友善的提议，会让那家伙开心的。到了这个地步，没错，我愿意为此付出一切。如果你能把那些混蛋带走……去哪儿都行，比如为我们找个精神监狱，那我们俩都能松口气，而且还能再次见到第五适格者，算是额外的收获。所以，我确实想说‘谢谢你’。”

"I do not make this offer lightly, Second Child. Nor will I make it a habit."

我并非轻率地提出这个建议，二少爷。我也不会养成这个习惯。

"What about the rest of the people in the Ring of Souls, Rei?" Shinji asked.

"灵魂之环里的其他人怎么办，丽？" 真嗣问道。

"I will begin to…," she pursed her lips. "Allow and encourage them to either reincarnate as they were like you did, or let them re-enter the cycle of rebirth, now that the world is being restored enough to let them. I have determined your actions are enough of an inflection point to make that option viable again."

"我将开始…" 她抿紧了嘴唇，"允许并鼓励他们像你一样转世，或者让他们重新进入轮回，既然世界已经恢复到足以容纳他们的程度。我已判定你的行为足以成为一个转折点，使得这一选择再次可行。"

Shinji almost sagged. "That's… more than I could have hoped for a year ago, Rei. Thank you."

真嗣几乎要瘫软下来。“那……一年前我都不敢奢望，绫波，谢谢你。”

Rei stared at him, her face losing it's blank expression. For the first time, it seemed almost sad and lonely. "...I will always care for you, Ikari-kun."

绫波凝视着他，脸上的空白表情消失了。第一次，她的神情似乎显得悲伤而孤独。“……我永远都会关心你，碇君。”

Rei's face scrunched up like she'd bitten a lemon. "...and through him, I will also watch out for you, Soryu-san, for as long as you two are… one."

零的脸皱成一团，仿佛刚咬了一口柠檬。“……通过他，我也会关照你，苏龙先生，只要你们俩还是……一体的。”

Asuka and Shinji shared a look. "We are?" Asuka said carefully.

明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神。“我们吗？”明日香小心翼翼地说。

Rei nodded. "You always have been, in a way. It was the denial and almost willful destruction of that which I hated you for. Now… it is hard to deny that you are united."

绫点了点头。“某种程度上，你一直都是。我曾因你的否认和近乎故意的自我毁灭而恨你。现在……很难否认你们已经团结一致。”

"Wait, 'always'?!" Asuka hiccuped. "What do you mean, 'always'?!"

"等等，'总是'？！" 明日香打了个嗝，"你说的'总是'是什么意思？！"

Rei gave the ghost of a smirk. "I must go. I cannot leave our Earth for too long. Goodnight." She began to fade back into the mass of partygoers, heading for the portal to their world.

丽露出了一丝难以察觉的微笑。“我必须走了。我不能离开我们的地球太久。晚安。”她开始在人群中逐渐淡去，朝着通往他们世界的传送门走去。

"Oh no you don't, Wondergirl! Get back here, you…"

哦不，你别想跑，神奇女孩！给我回来，你……

The bluenette was already gone.

蓝发女郎已不见踪影。

"Fuck, how did she escape that fast?" Asuka growled.

"妈的，她怎么逃得那么快？" 明日香咆哮道。

"That was honestly kind of amazing," Shinji admitted.

“说实话，那真是有点不可思议，”真嗣承认道。

Asuka glared at him. "'Always'?!" she demanded at him.

明日香瞪着他。“'总是'？！”她向他质问道。

Shinji gave her a slanted smile. "Asuka, is it that hard to believe we've kind of had some kind of bond for… well, since Rei knew us?"

真嗣对她露出了一个斜斜的微笑。“明日香，难道我们之间从认识绫波开始就有的某种联系，真的那么难以置信吗？”

"I am going to stab her in the head next time we see her!" Asuka fumed. "Yes, it's…" She tried to glare at his open, loving smile. "Ok, fine, no, it's not that hard to say you and I were some kind of thing from the moment we all met! But GOTT, am I going to stab her in the face with a fork when we see her again for saying that out loud in public!"

"下次见到她，我非得往她脑袋上捅一刀不可！" 明日香气愤地说。"是啊，这……" 她试图用眼神瞪向那张坦率而充满爱意的笑脸。"好吧，算了，其实说你我俩从一开始见面就有某种关系，也没那么难开口！但天哪，她要是在公共场合这么大声说出来，下次见面我非得用叉子戳她脸不可！"

Shinji just smiled at her. "Oh?"

真嗣只是对她微笑了一下。“哦？”

"I need years to work up to that kind of admission! You know that!"

我需要多年时间才能鼓起勇气做出那种坦白！你知道的！

"I love you. Always have."

我爱你。一直如此。

"Shut up, you idiot! And you know what?!"

闭嘴，你个白痴！知道吗？！

"Mmm?" "嗯？"

Asuka grabbed him and kissed him hard. "Our children are going to be beautiful. Now shut up and dance with me. We'll worry about your incredibly annoying sister in the morning. Right now, we dance."

明日香一把抓住他，用力吻了上去。“我们的孩子一定会很漂亮。现在闭嘴，跟我跳舞。你那烦人的妹妹，我们明早再操心。此刻，我们只管跳舞。”

She took his hand and pulled him towards the bonfire outside on the beach, and made him dance with her. He went willingly.

她牵起他的手，拉着他朝海滩外的篝火走去，与他共舞。他欣然前往。

'Our children will be beautiful…' she thought with a smile, and kissed her fiancé as they whirled around the fire in the light of many moons.

我们的孩子将会很美……' 她微笑着想，并在众多月光的照耀下，与未婚夫围着篝火旋转时吻了他。

And all was right with the world.

世界一切安好。

Author's Note, 28APR21: And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done."

作者注，2021 年 4 月 28 日：第七位天使将他的碗倾倒于空中；自天庭的圣所，从宝座上，传来一个宏大的声音，说道：“成了。”

December 2017 I posted the previous chapter on its first forum. The fic has been languishing ever since. But now, thanks to half a bottle of Aviation Gin, a shot of Midori, a shot of whipped cream vodka, and no sleep, I did it. I finished it.

2017 年 12 月，我在第一个论坛上发布了前一章。自那以后，这篇小说便一直搁浅。但如今，多亏了半瓶航空金酒、一剂蜜多丽、一剂奶油伏特加，以及彻夜未眠，我做到了。我完成了它。

Pieces have been written over the last few years, but now the last last last scene is done, and we can officially say A Crown of Stars is a complete fic.

过去几年间陆续写就篇章，如今最终最终最终幕已落笔，我们得以正式宣告《星辰之冠》为一部完结之作。

Thank you very much to everyone who held on. Here's the end our two Pilots have been waiting for and deserving for so long. There might be epilogues, or other appearances, but for now, their story is told.

非常感谢所有坚持下来的人。这是我们两位飞行员期待已久、当之无愧的结局。或许还有尾声，或其他出场，但目前，他们的故事已经讲述完毕。
