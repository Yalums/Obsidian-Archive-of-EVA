### Chapter 1: Possibilities  

A beam of light shone across his face as the boy slept, illuminating his blank expression. His mouth was slightly agape as his chest rose and fell slightly. I tiptoed around his bag, and hopped awkwardly over a small pile of manga, almost falling into the shelf of Shinji's robot models in the process. Lucky, I managed to carry my momentum forward instead, falling away from the shelf and right on top of Shinji… and the giant lump underneath the covers.  
一束光线照在熟睡的男孩脸上，映出他茫然的表情。他的嘴微微张开，胸膛轻轻起伏。我踮着脚绕过他的书包，笨拙地跳过一小堆漫画，差点摔进真嗣的机器人模型架子里。幸运的是，我设法保持了平衡，没有撞上架子，而是直接跌倒在真嗣身上……还有被子下的大鼓包。

Of course, I had seen it before. I mean, I do wake him up every morning. I mean, it was just yesterday when I slapped him. Twice, mind you, once for that and once for calling me a pain in the ass.  
当然，我之前见过。我的意思是，我每天早上都会叫醒他。就在昨天，我还扇了他两巴掌，一次是因为这个，另一次是因为他叫我讨厌鬼。

Someone had to keep that boy in check, and as his childhood friend, who better?  
总得有人管管那小子，作为他的青梅竹马，还有谁比我更合适呢？

"What the- what are you doing on top of me?!" At least he was awake today.  
“搞什么——你趴在我身上干嘛？！”至少他今天醒了。

"It's your fault!" I quickly redirected the blame. "If your room wasn't an absolute pigsty I wouldn't have fell!"  
"都是你的错！" 我迅速转移了责任。"如果你的房间不是一团糟，我就不会摔倒了！"

Well, it was his fault. Stupid Shinji and his stupid manga. I was exaggerating a bit about the pigsty – my room was much worse. Shinji even properly put his shirts on hangers, instead of strewn around the floor.  
好吧，确实是他的错。愚蠢的真嗣和他那愚蠢的漫画。关于猪圈的夸张说法——我的房间更糟糕。真嗣甚至把他的衬衫挂在衣架上，而不是散落在地板上。

"What does my room being a little messy have to do with your lack of balance?" He asked, still a bit testy.  
"我的房间有点乱和你平衡感差有什么关系？" 他问道，语气仍有些不悦。

I sighed loudly and decided that it wasn't worth the time it would take to explain – we were actually going to be late.  
我大声叹了口气，决定不值得花时间解释——我们真的要迟到了。

"Forget it!" I yelled. "Just get ready."  
“算了！”我喊道，“快准备好。”

"Alright, alright," he said, walking to the washroom. I took the time to bulldoze the offending comics with my foot into his cello, leaning at the side room – I wasn't about to trip over the same stack tomorrow.  
“好了，好了，”他说着走向洗手间。我趁机用脚把那些碍事的漫画踢进他靠在侧室的低音提琴里——我可不想明天再被同一堆东西绊倒。

I grabbed a set of Shinji's school uniform out of the closet, along with a pair of socks. Honestly, I did everything for him in the mornings. I chuckled at what would happen if I didn't wake him every day, imagining a half-dressed Shinji running into class halfway through first period.  
我从衣柜里抓了一套真嗣的校服，还有一双袜子。老实说，早上我什么都为他做。想到如果我不每天叫醒他，想象着半裸的真嗣在第一节课过半时冲进教室的情景，我不禁笑了。

"Why do I bother…," I muttered to no one in particular.  
“我干嘛要费这个劲…”我自言自语道。

The little penguin bobble-head doll I bought him for his last birthday nodded in sympathy.  
我给他买的那个小企鹅摇头娃娃，在他上次生日时，似乎也在同情地点头。

"Put this on!" I threw the clothes at him as I yanked open the bathroom door. The poor boy tripped on his towel in shock at the sudden lack of privacy. Served him right for waking up late.  
"快穿上这个！" 我把衣服扔给他，同时猛地拉开浴室门。可怜的男孩被突如其来的隐私丧失吓得连毛巾都踩到了。谁让他睡过头了呢。

He awkwardly jumped around, trying to get his legs through the right hole on his pants while closing the door. After a short while, he emerged, hair unkempt. His collar was messed up, half of it sticking up, other half twisted.  
他尴尬地跳来跳去，试图把腿伸进裤子的正确洞里，同时关上门。过了一会儿，他出来了，头发凌乱。他的衣领也一团糟，一半翘起来，另一半扭着。

"You idiot," I teased softly, smiling. I leaned in and straightened his collar out for him. "You're hopeless."  
"你这个笨蛋，" 我轻声打趣，笑着。我凑近帮他整理好衣领。"你真是没救了。"

He grinned sheepishly as I finished up.  
他腼腆地笑了笑，我刚好结束。

"There." I said. "Now you're dressed for success."  
“好了。”我说，“现在你可是成功人士的装扮了。”

My hands lingered on his shoulders for a brief moment, realizing how close we were. No, not a moment - an eternity.  
我的手在他肩上停留了片刻，意识到我们靠得有多近。不，不是片刻——而是永恒。

"Um…" I couldn't stop looking into his eyes.  
“呃…” 我无法停止凝视他的眼睛。

Shinji's mom interrupted us, clad in her apron, a stack of buttered toast in hand.  
真嗣的妈妈打断了我们，身着围裙，手里端着一叠涂了黄油的吐司。

"Here you go, dear," she offered. Shinji almost leapt to the waiting food, grabbing two pieces.  
“给你，亲爱的，”她递过来。真嗣几乎跳了起来，抓起两片。

"Would you like some too?" She asked me, thrusting the plate in my direction.  
"你也想来点吗？" 她问我，将盘子朝我这边推了推。

"No, thank you Mrs. Ikari," I declined. "I already ate before I came up."  
"不了，谢谢碇太太，" 我婉拒道，"我来之前已经吃过了。"

Shinji's mom winked at me as she brought the plate back to the kitchen. Shinji, already munching on a piece of toast, missed it.  
碇君的妈妈对我眨了眨眼，然后端着盘子回到了厨房。碇君已经在嚼着一片吐司，没注意到这一幕。

"Don't forget to bring your lunch!" She called out.  
“别忘了带午饭！”她大声喊道。

I pushed him to the doorway, bags in hand. Shinji took a break from eating to say goodbye to his mom. His dad had already left for the university. I said a hasty goodbye as I slipped on my shoes.  
我推着他到了门口，手里提着包。真嗣从吃东西的间隙停下来向妈妈告别。他爸爸已经去大学了。我匆匆穿上鞋子，也说了声再见。

Today was a welcome change from the usual: instead of running to school, we were actually early enough to just walk. Just as well, I thought, remembering the collision yesterday.  
今天与往常不同，是个令人愉快的变化：我们没有跑着去学校，而是早到足以悠闲地步行。这样也好，我想起昨天的碰撞。

Arguing in class had _not_ been fun. Shinji, the wimp, had been so spineless that I had to defend him. And then the whole "Rei-Shinji-Asuka" love triangle rumour thing had become the topic of the day.  
在课堂上争吵并不好玩。真嗣这个懦夫，胆小到我不得不替他出头。然后整个“绫波-真嗣-明日香”的三角恋传闻就成了当天的话题。

No way. Love triangles? Asuka Soryu Langley is _not_ someone who gets into love triangles. Triangles are unfriendly – nothing good is ever in the shape of a triangle: the Bermuda triangle, shark fins in the water… even Triscuits are square, despite their name.  
不可能。三角恋？惣流·明日香·兰格雷可不是会陷入三角恋的人。三角形不友好——形状为三角形的东西从来没好事：百慕大三角、水中的鲨鱼鳍……就连名字叫“三棱”的饼干也是方形的。

Shinji was still chomping on the second piece of toast, oblivious to my mind's machinations.  
真嗣还在嚼第二片吐司，对我的内心活动浑然不觉。

"Hey, Shinji," I asked innocently. "What do you think of that new girl?"  
"嘿，真嗣，" 我天真地问道，"你觉得那个新来的女孩怎么样？"

"Who, Ayanami?" He replied between swallows.  
"谁，绫波吗？" 他吞咽间回答道。"

"Yeah, do you think she's cute?" I said.  
"是啊，你觉得她可爱吗？" 我说。"

He swallowed the last bite of toast before answering. "She's not bad, I guess," he thought aloud.  
他咽下最后一口吐司才回答。“我觉得她还不错，”他自言自语道。

"Prettier than me?" I questioned. I loved putting the boy on the spot. Though lately he'd been showing a bit more backbone, something which I took pride in.  
“比我漂亮吗？”我问道。我喜欢让这小子难堪。虽然最近他表现得更有骨气了，这点让我颇为自豪。

"Yeah," he laughed. "You're too ugly to compare." He stuck his tongue out.  
“是啊，”他笑着说，“你太丑了，没法比。”他吐了吐舌头。

Ouch. I knew he was joking, but that still hurt. The problem with being childhood friends is that sometimes in all the teasing, the truth gets blurred. What did he really think?  
哎哟。我知道他在开玩笑，但那还是让我感到痛。成为童年好友的问题在于，有时候在所有的戏弄中，真相变得模糊了。他到底是怎么想的呢？

"Jerk!" I insulted him playfully to mask my feelings.  
“混蛋！”我半开玩笑地骂他，以掩饰自己的情绪。

"Hey, don't ask the question if you can't handle the answer!"  
"嘿，如果你承受不了答案，就别问问题！"

"Humph," I mock-growled. "Well, you and that blue-haired bi…"  
"哼，"我模仿着低吼。"好吧，你和那个蓝头发的……"

My voice trailed off as I realized who was up ahead in the distance. Speak of the devil.  
我话音未落，意识到前方远处是谁。说曹操，曹操到。

Great. 太好了。

"Hey, Ayanami!" Shinji waved. The girl waved back and walked over to meet us.  
"嘿，绫波！" 真嗣挥手。女孩也挥手回应，并朝我们走来。

"Hey, guys, walking to school?" She greeted us cheerfully.  
"嘿，伙计们，去上学吗？" 她愉快地向我们打招呼。

"Yep," Shinji replied, equally as cheerfully.  
"是啊，" 真嗣同样愉快地回答道。

I was alternating between nausea at how much Shinji was drooling over her and anger over the fact that he was fraternizing with her. Her! The girl who had just run him over yesterday, and then argued in class about it after!  
我心里交替着对真嗣对她垂涎三尺的恶心感和对他与她套近乎的愤怒。她！昨天才把他撞倒，事后还在班上为此争吵的那个女孩！

"No hard feelings about yesterday, I hope?" She asked.  
"希望昨天的事你别放在心上？" 她问道。

"Sure," I eyed her a bit suspiciously. I was being a bit more catty than usual, but whatever. I had good reasons.  
"当然，"我有些怀疑地打量着她。我比平时更刻薄了些，但无所谓。我有充分的理由。

"How are you adjusting to Tokyo-3?" Shinji asked.  
"你对第三新东京市的适应如何？" 真嗣问道。

"It's been alright," Rei said. "All my friends in Tokyo-2 were sad when I left, but it's not like I'm never going to see them again, right?"  
"还好，" 绫波说。"我在第二新东京市的朋友们对我离开感到难过，但并不是说再也见不到他们了，对吧？

"Right!" Shinji beamed at her.  
"好极了！" 真嗣对她露出了笑容。

Meh, I thought. 呃，我想。

"Why did you transfer?" Shinji asked. I couldn't tell whether he was just trying to be polite, or whether he actually liked this girl.  
"你为什么转学？" 真嗣问道。我分不清他只是出于礼貌，还是真的喜欢这个女孩。

"Well, my father got a new job at this American bread company that's trying to expand into Japan, and their new offices are in Tokyo-3, so we had to move. He's in charge of marketing: have you ever heard of Wonder bread?"  
嗯，我爸爸在这家试图拓展到日本的美国面包公司找到了新工作，他们的新办公室在东京-3，所以我们不得不搬家。他负责市场营销：你听说过 Wonder 面包吗？

Wondergirl. Sounds perfect.  
Wondergirl。听起来很完美。

Wondergirl over there had hijacked my morning commute. That's right, leave me all alone while you two go on, chatting to each other like you're on a date. In fact, why don't I just go run into the street and play in traffic? It'd probably be less painful than listening to this conversation.  
那边的 Wondergirl 霸占了我的早班车。没错，把我一个人丢下，你们俩继续聊，就像在约会一样。实际上，我干嘛不直接跑到街上，去车流里玩耍呢？听这段对话可能还更痛苦些。

"Asuka?" Shinji asked. "明日香？" 真嗣问道。

What? Wait, they were talking to me.  
什么？等等，他们在跟我说话。

"Pardon me?" I said. "对不起，您说什么？" 我说。

"Rei just asked if we wanted to go shopping after school," he answered.  
“丽刚才问我们放学后要不要去购物，”他回答道。

"Shopping…?" I was surprised. I didn't want to spend my time with _her_. That's great Asuka, be even more catty to the new transfer student.  
“购物…？”我感到惊讶。我并不想和她一起度过时间。真是太好了，明日香，对新转学生更加刻薄一点。

"Um, I can't," I stuttered, struggling to think of a reason. "Because… I promised to go to the mall with Hikari after school!" Whew, Hikari would cover for me. Wait. Did I just say the mall? Way to think on your feet, Asuka.  
“呃，我去不了，”我结结巴巴地说，努力想找个理由。“因为…我答应了放学后和光一起去商场！”呼，光会帮我圆场的。等等。我刚才是不是说了商场？真是随机应变，明日香。

"Why don't you just come with us?" Shinji replied, undeterred.  
"为什么不直接跟我们一起去呢？" 真嗣回答，毫不气馁。

"Yeah," Rei added. "I could use your help picking out clothes! I'm a bit of a fashion disaster."  
"是啊，" 绫波补充道。"挑衣服时我需要你的帮助！我在时尚方面有点灾难。"

"With an invitation like that, how could I refuse?" I answered without enthusiasm.  
"有这样的邀请，我怎么能拒绝呢？" 我回答得毫无热情。

We arrived at the schoolyard – Shinji off to Toji and Kensuke, and Rei off to… well, Rei was still walking with me. I looked for Hikari, but she was nowhere to be found, probably helping the sensei with something before class started. I was stuck with Wondergirl.  
我们到达了校园——真嗣去找了东治和健介，而丽则继续……好吧，丽还是和我一起走着。我四处寻找光，但她不见踪影，可能是上课前在帮老师做些什么。我只能和这位冷面女孩一起。

"So, what's the deal with you and Shinji?" she asked in a not-so-innocent voice.  
“那么，你和真嗣是怎么回事？”她用一种不那么无辜的语气问道。

Answering a question with a question, I went on the offensive. "Why are you so interested? Are you into him or something?"  
我以问代答，采取了攻势。“你为什么这么感兴趣？难道你喜欢他还是怎么的？”

"Well, he's a bit of a pervert," Rei giggled. "But he's pretty cute."  
"嗯，他有点变态，" 丽笑着说，"但他挺可爱的。"

I was taken aback by how forward she was – how do you reply to something like that? Luckily, I caught a glimpse of Hikari walking through the front doors of the school.  
她的大胆让我有些吃惊——面对这样的话题该怎么回应呢？幸好，我瞥见了光从学校前门走进来。

"Hey, there's Hikari!" I blurted out, walking over to my friend.  
"嘿，那不是光吗！" 我脱口而出，走向我的朋友。

"Asuka? You still haven't answered my question…"  
“明日香？你还没回答我的问题呢……”

I pretended not to hear her as I walked faster.  
我假装没听见，加快了脚步。

Last year, Hikari had hosted a sleepover. Me and the other girls had gone over to read magazines, gossip, watch movies and do other girl-related things. During the night, I was mindlessly flipping an issue of _Cosmo_ or some other thing when I saw an article about the concept of the "friend-zone", or how a person can be seen as just a friend forever, instead of something more.  
去年，光举办了一个睡衣派对。我和其他女孩们一起去那里看杂志、闲聊、看电影，做些女孩子常做的事。晚上，我漫无目的地翻阅着一本《时尚》或其他类似的杂志，突然看到一篇关于“朋友区”概念的文章，讲的是一个人可能永远被视为朋友，而不是更进一步的关系。

Of course, this was the same magazine that had advertised articles like "Forty-eight tips to satisfy your man" and "How to lose those last 15 pounds", so it wasn't as if it was a great beacon of journalism.  
当然，这本杂志曾宣传过诸如“满足你男人的四十八个秘诀”和“如何甩掉最后 15 磅”的文章，所以它并非什么新闻界的伟大灯塔。

Still, I had read the entire article. I didn't know why – Shinji and I had obvious romantic tension at times, but I thought that was just our bodies talking to each other. It wasn't like either of us was harbouring secret deep feelings of love. All boy/girl friendships go through that, right?  
尽管如此，我还是读完了整篇文章。我不知道为什么——有时我和真嗣之间确实有明显的浪漫张力，但我认为那只是我们的身体在互相交流。我们俩都没有隐藏着深沉的爱意。所有男女友谊都会经历这些，对吧？

When the other girls and Hikari saw the article, they started the whole "Shinji and Asuka are a couple" talk, which only stopped when I threw a pillow at Hikari's face.  
当其他女孩和光看到那篇文章时，她们开始谈论“真嗣和明日香是一对”，直到我朝光的脸上扔了个枕头，这种话题才停下来。

Still, the phrase had stuck in my head. Not that I've ever seriously thought about the boy like that – just… when you're best friends with someone of the opposite gender for so long, you can't help but wonder, you know?  
尽管如此，这句话一直萦绕在我脑海中。并不是说我真的那样想过那个男孩——只是……当你和一个异性成为最好的朋友这么久，难免会忍不住去想，你知道吗？

Today, Hikari was doing her own wondering… about that stupid track-suited dimwit, Toji.  
今天，光自己在那儿琢磨……关于那个穿着运动服的傻大个，冬二。

"I just did it," she breathlessly mentioned as I approached.  
"我就是做了，"她气喘吁吁地说着，当我走近时。

"Did what?" I asked. "做了什么？"我问道。

"You forgot? Today? You know…" Hikari blushed.  
"你忘了？今天？你知道的……" 光脸红了。

"The letter!" I quickly recalled. I had even stayed after class with Hikari last week to write it - a love letter to be shoved into his shoe locker. Anonymous, of course, saying that they had the same homeroom, asking him to meet her on the roof after class.  
"那封信！" 我迅速想起来了。上周我还和光一起留在教室里写它——一封情书，要塞进他的鞋柜里。当然是匿名的，信中提到他们同班，约他在课后到屋顶见面。

"Do you think he'll come?" She asked. I opened the door to the hallway as we walked to class.  
"你觉得他会来吗？" 她问。我们走向教室时，我打开了走廊的门。

"Yeah," I said. "He'll be there." I didn't exactly approve Hikari's taste in men, but even an idiot like Toji would leap for the chance to be with her. And if he didn't… well, it'd probably be better for her. Probably.  
"嗯，"我说，"他会去的。" 我并不完全赞同光对男人的品味，但即使是像真嗣这样的傻瓜，也会抓住机会和她在一起。如果他不去……好吧，对她来说可能更好。大概。

"Ahhh," I remembered. "Sorry I wasn't there to help you with the letter this morning."  
“啊，”我想起来了，“抱歉早上没能帮你处理那封信。”

"It's alright," Hikari giggled a bit. "I know how important waking up Shinji is."  
“没关系，”光笑了笑，“我知道叫醒真嗣有多重要。”

I opened my mouth to retort, but then I decided against it. I wasn't about to get into that again. Instead, I avoided the conversation again.  
我张嘴想要反驳，但随即打消了这个念头。我可不想再陷入那种争论。于是，我再次避开了这个话题。

"Are you sure you put it in the right locker?"  
"你确定放对柜子了吗？"

"Yeah, positive." "嗯，绝对没错。"

We reached the class, where the idiot trio were already sitting together, deep in thought. I caught a peek of what today's subject of discussion was – Hikari's letter. I nodded at my friend. It was a good thing that the boys never bothered keeping their voices low.  
我们到了教室，那三个傻瓜已经坐在一起，陷入沉思。我瞥了一眼他们今天讨论的主题——光的那封信。我向朋友点了点头。还好这些家伙从不注意压低声音。

"Who do you think put it in there?" Kensuke asked. "She's in our class?"  
"你觉得是谁放进去的？" 真希问。"她在我们班吗？"

"I don't know," Toji scratched his head. The image of an ape doing the same thing entered my mind.  
"我不知道，" 冬二挠了挠头。我脑海中浮现出一只猴子做同样动作的画面。

"Well, take a guess," Shinji offered. "Maybe it's Hikari?"  
"嗯，猜猜看，" 真嗣提议。"或许是光？"

"Nah," Toji said. "The class rep hates me ever since I dumped sand over her in second grade."  
"不，" 冬二说，"自从我二年级时把沙子倒在她头上后，班长就一直讨厌我。"

I stifled a giggle. 我忍住笑意。

"Can't be Asuka," Kensuke stated the obvious. "What about Mizuki?"  
"不可能是明日香，" 真希说出了显而易见的事实，"那美月呢？"

Mizuki Musashi was a classmate of ours – she, and just about every other girl in the class knew that Hikari had a crush on Toji.  
水木武藏是我们班的同学——她，以及班上几乎所有其他女生都知道光喜欢东治。

"Maybe," Toji said. "I don't know."  
“也许吧，”东治说，“我不知道。”

"Well, are you going to-" Shinji's question, the only one I had been interested in hearing the answer to, was cut off by the screech of tires as our teacher announced her presence.  
“那么，你打算——”真嗣的问题，也是我唯一感兴趣想听到答案的那个，被轮胎的刺耳声打断了，因为我们的老师宣布了她的到来。

The three ran to the window to give Misato their daily V signs, complete with matching idiotic grins. Great.  
三人跑到窗前，向美里展示他们每日的 V 字手势，脸上挂着如出一辙的傻笑。真是绝了。

"Rise! Bow! Sit down!" “起立！鞠躬！坐下！”

Too bad Hikari had to start class. The rest of their conversation would be by computer.  
可惜光要开始上课了。他们剩下的对话只能通过电脑进行了。

The morning came and went. Miss Katsuragi wasn't as bad as say, our last sensei, but honestly, sometimes she was _too_ relaxed. When the lunch bell rang, she let us go for the day.  
早晨来了又去。比起我们之前的老师，如月小姐并不算糟糕，但说实话，她有时太放松了。当午餐铃响起时，她让我们放学了。

"I have a date," Misato grinned. "And I've got to get ready. You guys have been great today, so you can have the rest of the day off. Remember that your math homework is due tomorrow!"  
“我有约会，”美里笑着说。“我得准备一下。你们今天表现得很棒，所以可以休息一天。记得你们的数学作业明天要交！”

And she left with a wink, keys in hand.  
她眨了眨眼，手里拿着钥匙离开了。

"How does that woman keep her job?" Hikari scowled  
“那女人是怎么保住工作的？”光皱眉道

"I heard that her dad has some pull with the principal," I answered. "Something about them working together...  
"我听说她爸爸和校长有些关系，" 我回答道。"好像他们一起工作过……

"Wait, why are you still here?" I remembered the time. "You're going to be late: the note said after class!" The entire room had emptied in a hurry, excited at the unexpected early release. Shinji, Toji, and Kensuke had left in the crowd, Wondergirl tagging along. I'd have to deal with the trip later.  
"等等，你怎么还在这儿？" 我想起了时间。"你要迟到了：通知上说是课后！" 整个教室的人都急匆匆地离开了，对这意外的提前放学感到兴奋。真嗣、渡志和健介随着人群走了，明日香也跟着。我稍后再处理这段行程。

Hikari wouldn't look at me, instead preferring to look at the ground. "Asuka… would you do me a favour?"  
光没有看我，而是选择盯着地面。"明日香……你能帮我个忙吗？"

"What are you… oh no…" I groaned, as I realized what Hikari wanted me to do.  
"你在……哦不……" 我呻吟道，意识到光想要我做什么。

"Could you go to the roof first?" Hikari pleaded. "Just to see if he comes! I'll be there too, just hiding!"  
"你能先去屋顶吗？" 光恳求道，"只是看看他会不会来！我也会在那里，只是躲起来！"

My eye twitched a bit. It has a tendency to do that. "You're lucky I'm such a good friend…"  
我的眼角微微抽搐了一下。它有这个习惯。 "你真幸运，我有这么好的朋友……"

I grabbed Hikari and broke out into a run to the roof – we had to beat them there. We ran through the hall and up the stairs, but not before carefully slipping past Toji's little group while making sure we were out of sight – lucky that they walked so slowly.  
我抓住光，冲向屋顶——我们必须抢先一步。我们穿过走廊，跑上楼梯，但在小心翼翼地从冬二的小团体旁溜过之前，确保了不被发现——幸运的是，他们走得如此缓慢。

I threw Hikari behind one of the giant vents as we broke out into the sunlight, tossing our bags to her. We didn't have too much time to catch our breaths; the boys were juts behind us.  
我们冲进阳光下，我将光推到一个大通风口后面，顺手把包扔给她。我们没有太多时间喘息；那些男生紧随其后。

The door opened to reveal…  
门一开，映入眼帘的是……

"S-Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Asuka?!" "明日香？！"

"Why are you here?" I almost screamed.  
"你为什么在这里？" 我几乎尖叫道。

"WHY ARE YOU HERE?" He screamed.  
“你为什么在这里？”他尖叫道。

"Toji was supposed to come!" I replied.  
“Toji 本来说要来的！”我回答道。

"Wait, you're the one who gave Toji the letter?" Shinji's voice rose higher in surprise.  
“等等，是你把信给 Toji 的？”Shinji 的声音因惊讶而提高。

"RED DEVIL?" Toji clambered out of the hallway, pointing at me in shock. I heard a thud behind the door – Kensuke probably.  
“红魔？”Toji 从走廊里爬出来，指着我震惊地说。我听到门后传来一声闷响——大概是 Kensuke。

"HOLD IT!" I yelled. "I'M NOT THE ONE WHO GAVE YOU THAT STUPID LETTER!"  
"停下！" 我喊道，"我才不是那个给你那封愚蠢信件的人！"

"I did," Hikari meekly said, coming out from behind the vent.  
"是我，" 光 meekly 地说，从通风口后面走了出来。

Shinji and Toji both deflated a little.  
真嗣和冬二都稍微松了一口气。

"Come on," I said. I took my bag, grabbed Shinji by the ear and dragged him out to the hall. "Let's go."  
"快点，" 我说道。我拿起包，揪住真嗣的耳朵，把他拖到走廊上。"我们走吧。"

"H-hi," I heard Toji stammer.  
"嗨，" 我听到东治结巴地说。

I gave Hikari a little smile as I walked through the open door, pushing aside Kensuke. The boy had recovered from my surprise appearance, and was recording Hikari and Toji's awkward rendezvous.  
我走过敞开的门时，对光微微一笑，顺手推开了健介。那男孩已经从我突然出现的惊讶中恢复过来，正记录着光和东治尴尬的相遇。

"Where's Rei?" I asked, "Wasn't she with you?"  
"丽在哪里？" 我问，"她不是和你在一起吗？"

"She went home," Shinji said. "After she heard that we were going to help Toji, she said that the mall could wait till another day. She's eating lunch under the tree."  
"她回家了，" 真嗣说。"听到我们要帮东治后，她说可以改天再去商场。她现在在树下吃午饭。"

"Oh." I said. "哦。" 我说。

Kensuke interjected. "Well, as much as I'd love to stay here and make fun of the happy couple, I'm going to join Rei down there and see if she wants some company."  
健介插话道：“好吧，虽然我很想留在这里取笑这对幸福的情侣，但我打算下去找零，看看她是否需要陪伴。”

"So just to be clear, you were-"  
“所以，只是为了明确，你当时——”

"Only there to help out Hikari." I confirmed.  
“只是去帮光子的忙。”我确认道。

"And the letter…" "还有那封信…"

"All her." He didn't need to know that I helped write it. Heck, I didn't even want to know that I helped write it.  
"全是她的。" 他不需要知道我帮忙写过。见鬼，我甚至不想知道我帮忙写过。

"When do you think they'll be done?" He asked.  
"你觉得他们什么时候能完成？" 他问道。

"I don't know… she's planned this out for a while; Toji has class duty this week too. I bet she'll stay back to help him, and then they might go eat?"  
"我不知道……她已经计划这件事好一阵子了；东治这周也有班级值日。我打赌她会留下来帮他，然后他们可能会一起去吃饭？"

"Want to get lunch then?" Shinji asked. "I didn't bring mine."  
"那你想去吃午饭吗？" 真嗣问道。"我没带自己的。"

"I knew I forgot something this morning," I realized. "Sorry." Today was just one of those days… I had forgotten so many things, including packing my own lunch, too.  
"我就知道今早忘了什么，" 我意识到。"对不起。" 今天就是那种日子……我忘了好多事情，包括打包自己的午餐，也是其中之一。"

"It's fine," Shinji smiled. "So, lunch?"  
"没事的," 真嗣微笑道。"那么, 吃午饭吗?"

"Sure, you can buy me lunch," I grinned.  
"当然, 你可以请我吃午饭," 我咧嘴笑道。

"Fine," he said. "Where to?"  
"好吧," 他说。"去哪儿?"

"I coouulldd make you take me to that expensive French place I've been talking about… hmmm…," I teased, smiling at him. "Let's just go get burgers and then the arcade?"  
"我本可以让你带我去那家我一直念叨的昂贵法国餐厅的……嗯……," 我打趣道，笑着看他。"还是去吃汉堡，然后去游戏厅？"

"Alright," he smiled back. We left the school and started walking to the entertainment district.  
"好啊," 他笑着回应。我们离开学校，开始向娱乐区走去。

See, this is what I like best about what we are. Nothing's complicated. I don't have to hide a note in his locker to meet for lunch. We don't even have to talk while we're walking. Shinji, just smiling like an idiot at everything around him. Me… well. Yeah.  
看，这就是我最喜欢我们这种关系的地方。一切都不复杂。我不需要在柜子里给他留张纸条约午饭。我们甚至走路时都不用说话。真嗣，只是像个傻瓜一样对着周围的一切傻笑。我……嗯，就是这样。

And we have the same interests – I mean, would Rei go with him to the arcade to play video games? We've known each other for forever – we know practically everything about each other, and we don't care about our differences.  
我们的兴趣相同——我是说，丽会跟他一起去游戏厅玩电子游戏吗？我们相识已久——几乎对彼此了如指掌，我们不在乎彼此的差异。

Shinji has no idea what I'm thinking. He's looking at the window of a practical toy shop.  
真嗣完全不知道我在想什么。他正盯着一家实用玩具店的橱窗看。

We just enjoy each other's company. And in the end, that's what makes me think – no, feel… sometimes, like there might just be something more lurking there. Yeah, I'll admit it to myself. Sometimes.  
我们只是享受彼此的陪伴。最终，这让我觉得——不，是感觉到……有时候，就像那里可能潜藏着更多东西。是的，我承认，有时候会这么想。

"Hey, they have fake vomit!"  
“嘿，他们有假呕吐物！”

And then he does something like that.  
然后他就做了那样的事。

"No, you are _not_ getting fake vomit," I chided, gently taking his arm and forcing him to walk.  
“不，你别想拿假呕吐物糊弄我，”我轻声责备，轻轻抓住他的手臂，强迫他一起走。

The burger shop was emptying out. Businessmen and other kids from our school alike had already eaten and were hurrying back. I guess that whole rooftop escapade had taken longer than I thought. At least we had the rest of the day off.  
汉堡店渐渐空了。商人和我们学校的其他孩子都已经吃完，匆匆离去。我想那场屋顶上的冒险比我想象中花的时间更长。至少我们今天剩下的时间可以休息了。

I grabbed a booth while Shinji went to place our orders and pay – he didn't even need to ask me what I wanted. He probably even knew where I was going to suggest for lunch – my American heritage cried out for a burger every now and then. He didn't even complain about paying: Japanese burger places could be pretty pricey.  
我抢了个卡座，而真嗣去点餐并付款——他甚至不需要问我想要什么。他大概连我打算提议去哪儿吃午饭都知道——我的美国血统时不时地呼唤着汉堡。他甚至没抱怨付款的事：日本的汉堡店有时相当昂贵。

The scary thing was, I _could_ imagine us as a couple pretty easily. It wouldn't be that much of a change – just instead of me leading him by the arm away from fake vomit, it would be us holding hands. Instead of him paying for lunch… well, he'd probably still pay for lunch. We were growing up, and I didn't know how things would turn out. Rei said she thought he was cute. He said he thought she was cute. Two plus two equals four. But what did Shinji and I equate to?  
可怕的是，我能轻易想象我们成为一对的样子。那不会有多大变化——只是不再是我在假呕吐物前拽着他的手臂离开，而是我们手牵手。而不是他付午餐钱……好吧，他大概还是会付午餐钱。我们在成长，我不知道事情会如何发展。丽说她觉得他可爱。他说他觉得她可爱。二加二等于四。但我和真嗣等于什么呢？

There wasn't a line-up, so he was back pretty quickly.  
没有排队，所以他很快就回来了。

"The burgers should be done quickly," he said, handing me a milkshake.  
“汉堡应该很快就做好了，”他说着，递给我一杯奶昔。

I sucked on the straw, focusing on my drink. Dammit. Asuka Soryu Langley does not get pushed into anything. I was _not_ thinking about this.  
我吸着吸管，专注于我的饮料。该死。惣流·明日香·兰格雷不会被推入任何事情。我并没有在想这个。

"Penny for your thoughts?" Shinji awoke me from my reverie.  
“你在想什么呢？”真嗣把我从沉思中唤醒。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"You're spacing out a bit – are you alright?"  
"你有点走神了——没事吧？"

I didn't reply – should I tell him about thinking about us? How would he react? Or would he tell me he's been thinking about the same thing?  
我没有回答——我该告诉他我在想我们的事吗？他会怎么反应？还是他会告诉我他也在想同样的事情？

"I'm just thinking about what Hikari did today," I lied.  
"我只是在想今天光做了什么，"我撒谎道。

"Yeah, the look on Toji's face was priceless," he laughed.  
"是啊，东治的表情真是无价之宝，"他笑着说。

"Yours wasn't too bad either," I teased. "But seriously, she's liked him for so long, and now she actually did something about it. I wonder if they'll get together?"  
"你的也不赖嘛，"我打趣道。"不过说真的，她喜欢他那么久了，现在终于有所行动了。不知道他们会不会在一起？"

I swirled my straw around in quiet contemplation.  
我静静地搅动着吸管，陷入沉思。

"Maybe," Shinji replied. "I don't think Toji's never thought about her that way – he's definitely stared at her in class before though."  
"或许吧，" 真嗣回答道。"我觉得东治从未那样想过她——不过他确实在课堂上盯着她看过。"

He took a sip of his milkshake, and then continued.  
他喝了一口奶昔，然后继续说道。

"I don't know if Toji'll ever live it down," Shinji chuckled. "Having a girl ask him out."  
"我不知道东治是否能释怀这件事，" 真嗣轻笑道。"被一个女孩主动约出去。"

"What are you laughing at?" I replied. "You're the same way too. I can't imagine you asking a girl out to save your life."  
"你在笑什么？" 我回道。"你也一样。我无法想象你会为了救命去约一个女孩。"

Oh why was I doing this to myself? Why why why…  
哦，我为什么要这样折磨自己？为什么为什么为什么……

"I'm not as bad as Toji," Shinji argued. "I wouldn't need a girl to ask me out."  
"我没东治那么糟糕，" 真嗣辩解道。"我不需要女孩来约我。"

The server came by and brought us our burgers, along with a basket of fries.  
服务员走过来，给我们端上了汉堡，还有一篮薯条。

"Oh please," I said as I grabbed the bottle of ketchup. "You're as thick as this bottle. Stupid ketchup."  
“哦，拜托，”我一边说着一边抓起番茄酱瓶。“你跟这瓶子一样厚。愚蠢的番茄酱。”

I was now whacking the bottle violently on its butt, as the red paste inched slowly towards my plate.  
我现在正用力敲打着瓶底，红色的酱料缓缓向我的盘子爬去。

"You know what?" He said. "I'll even prove it to you. The next time I really like a girl, I'll ask her out."  
"你知道吗？" 他说，"我甚至可以向你证明。下次我真的喜欢上一个女孩，我会约她出去。"

"That'll be the day," I snorted. Uh-oh, what did I just do? The ketchup had finally made it onto the plate.  
"那一天会来的，" 我嗤之以鼻。哎呀，我刚刚做了什么？番茄酱终于滴到了盘子上。

I dipped a fry and popped it into my mouth.  
我蘸了一根薯条，塞进嘴里。

"Alright," I said. "I'll hold you to that."  
"好吧，"我说。"我会记住你这句话的。"

I just picked at my burger after that, barely listening to Shinji talk.  
之后我只是随意拨弄着我的汉堡，几乎没在听真嗣说话。

After we finished eating, we wandered over to the arcade. It was mostly deserted, but there was the odd teenager there, either skipping school, or high school dropouts who were killing time.  
吃完饭后，我们晃悠到了游戏厅。那里基本上空无一人，只有零星几个青少年，要么是逃学的，要么是高中辍学的人在打发时间。

Shinji and I grabbed change and went to go play a shooting game.  
真嗣和我拿了零钱，去玩射击游戏。

"So I noticed you didn't actually go to the mall with Hikari," Shinji casually remarked, as he blew the leg off an approaching zombie.  
“所以我注意到你其实没和光一起去商场，”真嗣一边随意地说着，一边吹掉了迎面而来的僵尸的一条腿。

"Well, I couldn't exactly say 'hey, I'm helping Hikari confess her undying love for Toji today," I explained, shooting a gross maggot-zombie.  
“呃，我总不能直接说‘嘿，我今天在帮光向当麻表白她永恒的爱’吧，”我解释道，射杀了一只恶心的蛆虫僵尸。

"Yeah, but what does that have to do with the mall? You could've gone after." Shinji replied, blowing holes into both my explanation and another zombie.  
"是啊，但这跟商场有什么关系？你本可以继续追的。" 真嗣回答道，不仅反驳了我的解释，还顺便干掉了一个僵尸。

I blew another zombie's head off before it could reach Shinji's side of the screen.  
我赶在它接近真嗣那边的屏幕前，又爆了一个僵尸的头。

"Fine, I just didn't want to interrupt your little date, happy?"  
"好吧，我只是不想打扰你的小约会，满意了？"

"Date?" “日期？”

I turned to face him, ignoring the undead. "You and Wondergirl. I didn't want to be third wheel on your little date. We don't have to do everything together, you know?"  
我转过身面对他，无视那些不死生物。“你和神奇女孩。我不想成为你们小约会的电灯泡。我们不必每件事都一起做，你知道的？”

I swivelled back to shoot zombies.  
我又转回去射杀僵尸。

"Asuka, it wasn't a date," he said. It was Shinji's turn to face me. "And I like doing things with you."  
"明日香，那不是约会，" 他说。轮到真嗣面对我了。"而且我喜欢和你一起做事。"

"I know, but I just don't like her. She just ran you over yesterday!" I concentrated on the screen.  
"我知道，但我就是不喜欢她。她昨天才把你撞倒的！" 我专注于屏幕。"

"She apologized," Shinji stated, a bit icily.  
"她道歉了，" 真嗣冷冷地说道。"

"Yeah, well, I still don't like her," I repeated. "Can we just drop this?"  
"是啊，我还是不喜欢她，"我重复道，"我们能别提这事了吗？"

"Alright," he said, tossing a grenade.  
"好吧，"他说着，扔出一颗手榴弹。"

"Besides," I offered. "We're doing something together now."  
"再说，"我提议道，"我们现在有共同的事情要做了。"

He hmmed in response. We weren't a couple, but why did it feel like a couple fighting?  
他哼了一声作为回应。我们并不是情侣，但为什么感觉像是在吵架的情侣呢？

I felt a sense of unease sweep in, as the giant boss zombie died in slow motion.  
当那巨大的 Boss 僵尸缓缓倒下时，我感到一阵不安袭来。

So many things had changed today - Hikari had told that meathead she liked him. Rei said she thought he was cute.  
今天发生了太多变化——光向那个肌肉男表白了。丽说她觉得他很可爱。

Shinji yelled as a zombie bit him, and his health ran out. At least the zombies were still the same.  
真嗣在被僵尸咬到时大喊，他的生命值耗尽了。至少僵尸还是老样子。

**Author's (Long and Rambling) Notes:  
作者（冗长且啰嗦）的笔记：**

For all four of you (yes, you!) who either haven't seen the entire series or who are still hopelessly lost, this takes place during that little slice of "normal Evangelion" in episode 26.  
对于你们四位（没错，就是你！）中那些还没看完整个系列或仍感到迷茫的人，这发生在第 26 集中那段短暂的“正常《EVA》”片段期间。

I actually wrote the first paragraph of this story about three or four months ago – it was just sitting there while I explored other ideas, and then I came back to it recently, deciding that the alternate reality presented in the end of the series was much more interesting. I know the setting's been done to death, but I haven't actually read an fic set in the alternate reality that's finished, written well, or which goes beyond a one-shot (not to say that they don't exist, just that I haven't found them… feel free to recommend some).  
实际上，这个故事的第一段大约在三四个月前就写好了——它就那样搁置着，而我则在探索其他想法，直到最近才重新回到它，决定系列结尾所呈现的平行现实更加引人入胜。我知道这种设定已经被用烂了，但我确实没读过一篇设定在平行现实中、完成度高、文笔好且不止于短篇的同人文（并不是说它们不存在，只是我还没找到……欢迎推荐）。

Also, the manga adaptations of Evangelion in high school (Shinji Ikari Raising Project and Angelic Days) are ridiculously slow to be translated, either officially or fan-translated (and let's face it, Angelic Days was a bit of a letdown).  
另外，《新世纪福音战士》的高中漫画改编版（《碇真嗣育成计划》和《天使之诗》）无论是官方还是粉丝翻译，进度都慢得离谱（说实话，《天使之诗》有点让人失望）。

I also like writing Evangelion characters in the alternate universe – it's fun writing them as (much more) well-adjusted people, having actual families and everything (gasp, Asuka can apologize?).  
我也喜欢在平行宇宙中创作《新世纪福音战士》的角色——写他们作为（更加）适应良好的人，拥有真正的家庭等等（惊讶吧，明日香也会道歉？），这很有趣。

Speaking of which, Asuka's quite the unreliable narrator of the story – if she seems self-contradictory (especially about Shinji), that's just the fun of writing in first-person POV.  
说到这个，明日香作为故事的叙述者可不太靠谱——如果她显得自相矛盾（尤其是关于真嗣的部分），那正是第一人称视角写作的乐趣所在。

Mizuki Musashi's name comes from a character in _Full Metal Panic!_ along with the Evangelion naming convention of Japanese battleships – Musashi was the sister ship of the Japanese battleship Yamoto. Figure I should be honest about any names I create – even if they have no bearing in the story.  
水木武藏的名字源自《全金属狂潮》中的一个角色，同时结合了 EVA 系列中以日本战舰命名的惯例——武藏是日本战舰大和的姊妹舰。我觉得应该对所创造的任何名字保持诚实——即使它们在故事中并无实际影响。

Reviews, comments, and criticisms are appreciated.  
欢迎点评、评论和批评。

[![](https://ff77.b-cdn.net/static/fcons/balloon.png)14](https://m.fanfiction.net/r/5588799/) Chapter 2: Intentions Chapter 2：意图  

_The angel was peculiar – a round blue ring of light. They still didn't know for sure if it was an angel; the pattern was only orange. Still, no one wanted to take the chance, so Rei and Asuka were to sortie. Even as they approached, the angel floated peacefully, like the halo of its namesake.  
那使徒颇为奇特——一个圆形的蓝色光环。他们仍不确定它是否真的是使徒；其图案仅是橙色。然而，没人愿意冒险，因此丽和明日香被派去出击。即便她们接近时，那使徒依旧平静地漂浮着，宛如其名所指的光环。_

"_It's coming," Rei said._ “它来了，”丽说道。

_The angel moved faster than anyone imagined, immediately breaking its ring-shape and lunging for Rei's Evangelion. She reacted, too late – Eva Unit-00 and the angel started to merged, the angel disappearing into the robot's hands like stigmata. The one-eyed giant fired its rifle helplessly over and over again, bullets bouncing off the blue whip-shape. The spent shells clattered onto the streets below.  
天使的移动速度超乎所有人的想象，瞬间打破了环形状态，猛扑向绫波的 EVA。她反应了，但为时已晚——EVA 初号机与天使开始融合，天使如同圣痕般消失在机器人手中。独眼巨人无助地一次次开枪，子弹却纷纷弹开那蓝色的鞭状物。用尽的弹壳叮当作响，散落在下方的街道上。_

_Asuka was launched in Unit-02, an obstinate action at best. The mecha refused to move for her. The handles felt lifeless in her hands, as the red behemoth stood, dormant. She could hear the panicked voices of those in Terminal Dogma, but everything was background noise to Asuka, helplessly looking on as the angel continued its assault.  
明日香被发射进二号机，这充其量是个倔强的举动。机甲拒绝为她移动。操纵杆在她手中毫无生气，红色巨兽静止不动，沉睡中。她能听到终端教条区那些惊慌失措的声音，但对明日香来说，一切都成了背景噪音，她无助地看着天使继续其攻击。_

_Large veins grew on the blue Evangelion as the infection grew, robot and creature joining together. Rei's pain could be heard over the com-link. Unit-02 was withdrawn, the sinking darkness of the elevator an apt setting for Asuka's mood.  
随着感染的加剧，蓝色 EVA 上长出了粗大的血管，机器人与生物融为一体。绫波的痛苦通过通讯链接传来。二号机被撤回，电梯下沉的黑暗恰如其分地映衬了明日香的心情。_

_And then Shinji came in to save the day. Last time, he had let Asuka sit there, helpless as her mind was laid bare. Last time it had been Rei to end her torment. No, the purple mecha would've never come if it were her infected by the Angel, she thought bitterly. It was a blatant vindication of her pathetic self-worth: Rei was more important than Asuka.  
随后，真嗣进来拯救了局面。上次，他任由明日香坐在那里，无助地看着自己的内心被揭露。上次是丽结束了她的痛苦。不，如果被天使感染的是她，那台紫色机甲绝不会出现，她苦涩地想。这明显是对她可怜的自尊的证实：丽比明日香更重要。_

_She had lost to the doll.  
她输给了那个玩偶。_

_The angel noticed this new combatant, moving towards Shinji.  
天使注意到了这位新战士，向真嗣移动过去。_

"_No," Rei stated, with a finality that belied her intentions. The angel stopped scant metres from Shinji, snapping at him with the ferocity a wild dog leashed. And then it disappeared into Unit-00 like a tape measure winding. The whine of the self-destruct initializing was audible._  
“不，”丽坚定地说，语气中的决绝掩盖了她的真实意图。天使在距离真嗣仅几米远的地方停下，以被拴住的野狗般的凶猛向他咆哮。随后，它像卷尺一样消失在零号机中。自毁程序启动的嗡鸣声清晰可闻。

_Was that a tear in Rei's eyes? Asuka couldn't be sure.  
那是丽眼中的泪水吗？明日香无法确定。_

_A white glow was the only answer she received.  
她得到的唯一回应是一片白光。_

My eyes opened to a white haze, as the after-effects of the dream mixed with the soft morning light. I turned on my side to take a glance at my alarm clock; it was barely 6:00. I lay there, wide-awake: the dream had made sure of that.  
我的眼睛在一片白雾中睁开，梦境的余韵与柔和的晨光交织在一起。我侧过身，瞥了一眼闹钟；才刚刚六点。我躺在那里，异常清醒：梦境确保了这一点。

What a ridiculous dream - Freud would've probably had a field day analyzing it. I turned again to lie on my back, pulling the covers over me, and again as I tried to get comfortable. This lasted about five minutes, before I gave up on sleep and scrambled to my feet.  
多么荒谬的梦——弗洛伊德大概会对此分析得津津有味。我再次翻身平躺，拉过被子盖住自己，又尝试着调整到舒适的姿势。这持续了大约五分钟，最终我放弃了睡眠，一跃而起。

I opened the sliding door to a darkened apartment. My parents were still in Germany on official research business; they knew I was mature enough to fend for myself. I grabbed a kettle from the cupboard, filled it with water, and put it on the stove to boil. My mug and an Earl Grey packet were set aside for when the water would be ready. Hopefully, some tea would sooth my nerves.  
我打开滑动门，进入一间昏暗的公寓。我的父母仍在德国进行官方研究工作；他们知道我已足够成熟，能够自力更生。我从橱柜里拿了一个水壶，装满水，放在炉子上烧开。我的茶杯和一包伯爵茶已准备好，只待水开。希望一些茶能安抚我的神经。

By the time I brushed my teeth and washed my face, I heard a high-pitched whine. Into my cup went the boiled water, quickly followed by the tea bag, and my usual milk and sugar. I took the mug to the balcony, sitting on the wooden patio chair we put outside. Tokyo-3 was still quiet, this early. A brisk autumn breeze was in the air: a bit chilly, perhaps, but I didn't mind, even only in my t-shirt and shorts.  
当我刷完牙洗完脸时，听到了一阵尖锐的嗡鸣声。我将开水倒入杯中，迅速放入茶包，接着是平常的牛奶和糖。我端着杯子走到阳台，坐在我们放在外面的木制露台椅上。第三新东京市依然宁静，这么早的时候。一阵清爽的秋风拂过：或许有些凉意，但我并不介意，只穿着 T 恤和短裤。

I took a sip; the hot liquid was still scalding. I started blowing on the surface, casually tossing the tea bag into a wastebasket. Shinji had been incredulous the first time he heard I drank tea in bags, not leaves. And not just any tea, but Earl Grey. This had been in first or second grade, I think.  
我抿了一口；热液依然烫口。我开始对着表面吹气，随手将茶包扔进垃圾桶。真嗣第一次听说我喝袋泡茶而不是茶叶时，感到非常不可思议。而且不是任何茶，而是伯爵茶。我想这应该是在小学一、二年级的时候。

"We live in Japan," he had said, quite appalled at my irreverence for Japanese tea leaves.  
“我们住在日本，”他当时说，对我不尊重日本茶叶的态度感到相当震惊。

I didn't care – chalk it up to my American and European heritage, I suppose. My dad always made sure he brought me packages of tea when he came back from Germany and New York. Japanese stores had outrageous prices for foreign-made stuff.  
我并不在意——大概得归功于我的美国和欧洲血统吧。我爸每次从德国和纽约回来，总会确保给我带几包茶叶。日本的商店对外国货定价高得离谱。

Shinji had stopped heckling me about it eventually, but he had always remembered. My next birthday, he gave me the red mug I used now, and a package of Earl Grey tea. It was pretty touching and thoughtful, especially considering how young we were. It was the first time I hugged him too, but only briefly: boys were still icky.  
真嗣最终不再为此取笑我，但他一直记得。我下一个生日时，他送了我现在用的红色杯子，还有一包伯爵茶。这相当感人且贴心，尤其是考虑到我们当时还那么小。那也是我第一次拥抱他，不过只是短暂的一下：男孩们还是让人讨厌。

I smiled absentmindedly at the memory. My thumb traced over a crack on the cup handle (my mom had glued it back together, after I accidentally dropped it and refused to get a new mug).  
我心不在焉地对着这段回忆微笑。拇指沿着杯柄上的裂痕划过（那是我不小心摔碎后，妈妈帮我粘回去的，我拒绝换一个新杯子）。

I was thinking about Shinji again. It's surprising how many aspects of my life he had touched, and vice versa. I signed to no one in particular – it was so easy to reminisce, but I had to figure out what to do with Shinji now. The tea was now cool enough that I could now take bigger swallows. Looking back into the kitchen, the clock now read 6:42. I didn't want to walk with him today. At least, I didn't think I did. This annoyed me, all the indecisiveness.  
我又在想真嗣了。真没想到，他竟然触及了我生活的方方面面，反之亦然。我向着无人处做了个手势——回忆总是那么容易，但我得弄清楚现在该怎么对待真嗣。茶已经凉到我可以大口喝下的程度了。回头看向厨房，时钟显示现在是 6 点 42 分。今天我不想和他一起散步。至少，我觉得我不想。这种犹豫不决让我感到烦躁。

Maybe I could at least make a decision on breakfast. I didn't even feel remotely hungry, but I knew I should probably eat something.  
也许我至少可以决定早餐吃什么。我一点儿也不觉得饿，但我知道我大概应该吃点什么。

But first, a shower. As I relished the feeling of the water running over me, I remembered something else - the math homework due today. After the arcade, I had just crashed on the couch and watched TV.  
但首先，洗个澡。当我享受着水流冲刷身体的感觉时，我想起了另一件事——今天要交的数学作业。从游戏厅回来后，我直接瘫倒在沙发上看电视。

"How convenient," I mused.  
“真是方便，”我暗自思忖。

I could go work on the stupid math problems at the library. I wouldn't have to see him until class.  
我可以去图书馆解决那些烦人的数学题。这样，上课前就不用见到他了。

We didn't always walk to school together; it was just a morning routine, back towards the end of elementary school, when we were both old enough to walk to school ourselves. Hopefully, he wouldn't read too much into me going to school early. After all, Shinji was still a boy, and boys were stupid at that stuff, right? This occupied my mind as I slipped on my red hair clips, another gift from Shinji.  
我们并非总是结伴上学；那只是小学末期的一个早晨习惯，那时我们都已足够大，可以自己步行去学校。希望他不会对我提前去学校想太多。毕竟，真嗣还是个男孩，而男孩在这方面总是很迟钝，对吧？我一边想着这些，一边戴上红色的发夹，这是真嗣送的另一份礼物。

I finished getting ready, grabbed my bag and left the apartment – food could wait.  
我收拾妥当，抓起书包离开了公寓——食物可以稍后再说。

` My phone read 7:06 as I rang the doorbell for Shinji's apartment. Mrs. Ikari answered the door, wearing her usual morning apron.  
` 我按响了真嗣公寓的门铃，手机显示时间是 7:06。碇太太开了门，一如既往地穿着她的晨间围裙。

"Hi dear, you're a bit early today, aren't you?"  
"嗨亲爱的，你今天来得有点早，不是吗？"

I liked Shinji's mom. She usually gave me a smile in the mornings, and took my side when Shinji got too unruly.  
我喜欢真嗣的妈妈。她通常早上会对我微笑，当真嗣太过顽皮时，她也会站在我这边。

"Hi Mrs. Ikari, I'm sorry for bothering you, but I have to go to school early today," I explained. "Could you let Shinji know that I'm not going to be walking with him today?"  
"嗨碇太太，很抱歉打扰您，但我今天得早点去学校，" 我解释道。"您能告诉真嗣我今天不和他一起走了吗？"

"Oh, okay," she replied. "By the way, when are your parents coming back from Germany?"  
"哦，好的，" 她回答道。"顺便问一下，你父母什么时候从德国回来？"

"They said they might be back next week, but it really depends on when they're going to be done that project they keep talking about," I answered.  
"他们说可能下周回来，但真的要看他们那个一直在谈的项目什么时候完成，" 我回答说。"

"Well, if you need anything, don't be afraid to ask," she offered. "I think I'll send Shinji over with some things for you later."  
"嗯，如果你需要什么，尽管开口，" 她提议道。"我想我稍后会让真嗣给你送些东西过来。"

"It's alright," I sheepishly said. "You don't have to."  
"没事的，" 我尴尬地说，"你不必这样。"

"Don't worry, dear, it's our pleasure."  
"别担心，亲爱的，这是我们的荣幸。"

"Anyway, I have to get going, thank you!"  
"不管怎样，我得走了，谢谢！"

She waved to me as I bowed and left.  
她向我挥手，我鞠了一躬后离开。

After a quick stop at a 7-eleven for some breakfast snack bread and a sushi bento for lunch, I went down the familiar road to school.  
在 7-eleven 匆匆买了些早餐面包和午餐的寿司便当后，我沿着熟悉的道路前往学校。

No annoying blue-haired girls today. No Shinji Ikari to piss me off. They'd probably see each other again today (if Shinji actually woke up on time without me), this time without me to interrupt their little chat. That thought was enough to keep me in a sour mood all the way to school.  
今天没有烦人的蓝发女孩。没有让我生气的碇真嗣。他们今天可能会再次见面（如果碇真嗣真的能按时起床而不需要我叫醒的话），这次没有我在旁边打断他们的小聊天。这个想法足以让我一路到学校都心情不好。

The library was actually somewhat full when I came in – most of the tables had at least one or two people. Hikari was, predictably, taking notes at one of the side tables, a stack of books in front of her.  
我进来时，图书馆其实已经相当满了——大多数桌子至少有一两个人。不出所料，光在一张边桌上做笔记，面前堆着一堆书。

"You're already starting to write that essay?" I announced my presence, eyeing the books she had taken out.  
“你已经开始写那篇论文了？”我宣布了我的到来，打量着她拿出来的书。

"Well, yeah," Hikari replied, as if it was perfectly normal. "It's due next month! Not all of us leave our assignments till the last day, you know."  
"嗯，是啊，" 光回答道，仿佛这是再正常不过的事。"下个月就要交了！不是所有人都把作业拖到最后一刻，你知道的。"

Her point was underscored by the fact that I took out my math textbook to work on homework due in a few hours.  
她的观点通过我拿出数学课本开始做几小时后要交的作业这一事实得到了强调。

"Not all of us are perfect like you," I rolled my eyes. "Speaking of imperfections, how was the jock? When we left, it looked like he was about to jump off the roof to escape."  
"不是所有人都像你这么完美，" 我翻了个白眼。"说到不完美，那个运动员怎么样了？我们离开时，他看起来像是要跳楼逃跑似的。"

Hikari blushed a bit, and stopped writing.  
光脸颊微微泛红，停下了手中的笔。

"We just talked and ate lunch," she answered. "And then I helped him with the chores, and he walked me home."  
"我们只是聊了聊天，吃了午饭，"她回答道，"然后我帮他做了家务，他送我回家。"

"Did you guys kiss?" I asked, my curiosity overcoming my gag reflex at the idea of anyone kissing that moron.  
"你们接吻了吗？"我问道，尽管想到有人会亲那个傻瓜让我反胃，但好奇心还是占了上风。

"Shh!" A junior at the next table shushed us, before turning back to her work.  
“嘘！”邻桌的一个低年级学生示意我们安静，然后转过头继续她的工作。

I stuck my tongue out at her in defiance and looked at Hikari.  
我对着她吐了吐舌头表示反抗，然后看向光。

"Well?" “那么？”

"No!" She emphatically denied. "We just held hands… I think we were both just trying not to say anything stupid, or to find something to talk about. It was a bit awkward, to be honest."  
“不！”她坚决否认，“我们只是牵了手……我想我们俩都只是不想说些蠢话，或者找点话题聊。老实说，有点尴尬。”

"Well, I guess him being nervous means he likes you, at least."  
"嗯，我想他紧张至少意味着他喜欢你吧。"

"I don't know," she frowned. "The whole time I got the feeling he was uncomfortable with me."  
"我不确定，"她皱眉道。"整个过程中我总觉得他对我感到不自在。"

"SHH!" The annoying girl struck again.  
"嘘！那个讨厌的女孩又来了！"

"Oh shush yourself," I snapped. "No one cares."  
"哦，闭嘴吧你，" 我厉声道，"没人关心。"

She made a rude gesture with her hand and packed up to sit at another table.  
她用手做了一个粗鲁的手势，然后收拾东西坐到另一张桌子去了。

"I'm not sure if I should've given him that note," Hikari told me as I threw an eraser at the junior's retreating back.  
"我不确定是否应该给他那张纸条，" 光对我说，而我则向那位后辈离去的背影扔去一块橡皮。

""Did you guys talk about it, at least?" I asked, now thoroughly satisfied.  
""你们至少讨论过这件事吗？" 我问道，现在完全满意了。""

"No, but I'm going to meet him for lunch again today," she answered.  
""没有，但我今天又要和他一起吃午饭了，" 她回答说。""

"Well, you should probably ask him then," I advised. "At least you'll get an answer."  
""嗯，那你应该问问他，" 我建议道。"至少你会得到一个答案。""

"Yeah, I guess," Hikari looked a bit crestfallen as she resumed taking notes.  
“嗯，我想是吧，”光看起来有些沮丧，继续做着笔记。

"It's better you gave him that note and got the whole thing over with than never knowing," I tried to assuage her mounting fears.  
"你把那张纸条给他，把事情了结，总比一直不知道要好，" 我试图缓解她日益增长的担忧。

"Maybe…" Hikari answered, without looking up from the paper.  
"或许吧…" 光回答，目光依旧停留在纸上。

I took this as a sign that she wasn't particularly interested in continuing the conversation, took out my breakfast, and started on math.  
我以此为信号，知道她对继续对话不太感兴趣，便拿出早餐，开始做数学题。

It wasn't a particularly challenging set of problems, just busy work. The first few questions were easy – these were just review questions to make sure we had the necessary skills to do math this year.  
这些问题并不特别棘手，只是些繁琐的工作。前几个问题很简单——这些只是复习题，确保我们具备今年做数学所需的技能。

_4. Shinji and his girlfriend went to the Yokohama Baystars game.  
4. 真嗣和他的女朋友去了横滨 Baystars 队的比赛。_

I shook my head. It was a stupid coincidence. Besides, Shinji hated the Baystars. His favourite team was the Giants. Heck, he didn't even like baseball that much. I read on.  
我摇了摇头。这真是个愚蠢的巧合。再说了，真嗣讨厌 Baystars 队。他最喜欢的球队是巨人队。见鬼，他其实并不怎么喜欢棒球。我继续读下去。

_4. Shinji and his girlfriend went to the Yokohama Baystars game. They spent ¥2000 on a day pass for unlimited travel on the railway. At the stadium, they spent ¥7000 on a pair of tickets. At the game, Shinji's girlfriend, Asuka, also bought a plate of French fries for-  
4. 真嗣和他的女朋友去了横滨 Baystars 队的比赛。他们花了 2000 日元买了一张铁路全日通票，可以无限次乘坐。在体育场，他们又花了 7000 日元买了一对门票。比赛中，真嗣的女朋友，明日香，还买了一盘薯条，花了——_

What? Either I was seeing things, or Misato was screwing with my head, especially after the argument in class. I read the last line again.  
什么？要么是我眼花了，要么是美里在捉弄我，尤其是在教室里那场争吵之后。我又读了一遍最后一行。

_At the game, Shinji's girlfriend, Asuka, also bought a plate of French fries for ¥750.  
比赛中，真嗣的女朋友，明日香，还买了一盘薯条，花了 750 日元。_

Damn it. 该死。

"Hikari, did you do question 4 on the math sheet?"  
“光，你数学试卷上的第 4 题做了吗？”

She looked up at me again.  
她再次抬头看向我。

"You're not having trouble with it already, are you? They're just start-of-year review questions."  
"你已经开始觉得难了吗？这些只是年初复习题。"

"Did you notice anything weird about the wording?" I shot her a quizzical look.  
"你有没有注意到题目措辞有什么奇怪的地方？" 我向她投去一个疑惑的眼神。

"No, is everything alright?" Hikari was as confused as me now.  
"没有，一切都还好吗？" 光现在和我一样困惑。

I looked at the paper again.  
我又看了一遍那张纸。

_4. Ryohei and his girlfriend went to the Yokohama Baystars game. They spent ¥2000 on a day pass for unlimited travel on the railway. At the stadium, they spent ¥7000 on a pair of tickets. At the game, Ryohei's girlfriend, Reina, also bought a plate of French fries for ¥750. Ryohei also bought a jersey and an autographed baseball at the game. The jersey cost twice as much as the ball. If Ryohei's budget was ¥20000, and he had ¥1250 yen left at the end of the day, how much were the jersey and the ball?  
4. 亮平和他的女朋友去了横滨 Baystars 队的比赛。他们花了 2000 日元买了一张铁路全日通票。在体育场，他们花了 7000 日元买了一对门票。在比赛中，亮平的女朋友丽奈还买了一盘法式薯条，花了 750 日元。亮平也在比赛中买了一件球衣和一个签名的棒球。球衣的价格是棒球的两倍。如果亮平的预算是 20000 日元，而他那天结束时还剩下 1250 日元，那么球衣和棒球各多少钱？_

"Asuka?" Hikari asked, as I read and re-read the question again.  
“明日香？” 光问我，而我再次阅读了那个问题。

"Yeah, never mind…" “嗯，没什么…”

Hikari just shrugged and went back to her work, and left me to my own problems, both math and otherwise.  
光只是耸了耸肩，继续她的工作，留下我独自面对数学和其他问题。

I was so unnerved that when Hikari left for homeroom, I purposely stayed behind so I wouldn't have time to talk to Shinji before class. I ducked into the familiar room just before bell rang, making it to my desk just as Hikari did her whole "rise, bow, sit down" routine.  
我如此不安，以至于当光去上早自习时，我故意留下来，以免在课前有机会和真嗣交谈。我在铃响前一刻溜进了熟悉的教室，正好在光进行“起立，鞠躬，坐下”的例行程序时到达我的座位。

Shinji tried to get my attention, but I did my best not to look at him. I didn't turn on my laptop, either, so he couldn't message me. Misato was talking to the class about an egg dropping assignment we were to do. My mind drifted in and out of listening.  
真嗣试图引起我的注意，但我尽量不去看他。我也没有打开笔记本电脑，这样他就无法给我发消息了。美里正在班上谈论我们要做的鸡蛋下落实验。我的思绪时而在听，时而又飘走了。

"… your grades will be determined by how much you can slow your egg down as it falls. I'll be measuring the seconds to impact…"  
"…你的成绩将取决于你能让鸡蛋在下落过程中减慢多少。我会测量撞击的秒数…"

Instead, I looked over to Wondergirl, who was staring at Shinji, not that he noticed. She saw me looking at her though, and quickly tried to hide the fact she was interested in my best friend.  
相反，我望向了 Wondergirl，她正盯着真嗣，尽管他并未注意到。但她看到我在看她，便迅速试图掩饰她对我最好朋友的兴趣。

"_You know what?" Shinji had said. "I'll even prove it to you. The next time I really like a girl, I'll ask her out."_  
"你知道吗？" 真嗣曾说。"我甚至可以向你证明。下次我真的喜欢上一个女孩时，我会约她出去。"

What if it became the other way around: what if the girl asked him out? Shinji said she was cute. What if he said yes? What if. What if. What if I just found out the answer?  
如果情况反过来会怎样：如果女孩主动约他出去呢？真嗣说过她很可爱。如果他答应了呢？如果。如果。如果我刚刚发现了答案呢？

When Misato let us out for lunch, I went over to Rei immediately. I saw Shinji try to approach me in the corner of my eye, then stop as he realized I was talking to Rei, of all people.  
当美里允许我们出去吃午饭时，我立刻走向绫波。我瞥见真嗣试图接近我，但当他意识到我在和绫波说话时，便停下了脚步。

"Want to have lunch?" I asked brusquely.  
“想一起吃午饭吗？”我直截了当地问。

Rei nodded, and grabbed her bag. I walked with her outside, making sure not to look at Shinji. My heart sank a bit as I saw the perturbed look on his face.  
丽点了点头，抓起她的包。我和她一起走到外面，尽量避免看真嗣。看到他脸上不安的表情，我的心沉了一下。

We sat under the tree in the schoolyard. I took out my pre-packaged lunch, while Rei brought out a small vegetarian platter.  
我们坐在学校操场的大树下。我拿出预先打包好的午餐，而丽则拿出一个小小的素食拼盘。

"You don't eat meat?" I asked, mildly surprised.  
“你不吃肉吗？”我有些惊讶地问。

"Well, I'm only vegetarian sometimes. I'll eat chicken and fish occasionally, but for the most part, no, I don't eat meat," she admitted.  
“嗯，我只是偶尔吃素。偶尔也会吃鸡肉和鱼肉，但大部分时候，不，我不吃肉。”她坦承道。

"I see," I said, putting a piece of eel into my mouth.  
“我明白了，”我说着，将一片鳗鱼放入口中。

"I'm surprised you asked if I wanted to have lunch." Rei bit on a carrot.  
“你居然问我是否想一起吃午饭，真让我惊讶。”丽咬了一口胡萝卜。

"Well, Hikari's having lunch with one of the idiot trio, and we needed to talk." I said between chews.  
“嗯，光正和那三个笨蛋中的一个一起吃午饭，而我们有些话需要谈谈。”我边嚼边说。

She tilted her head at me a bit, silently asking the obvious question.  
她微微侧头看向我，无声地提出了那个显而易见的问题。

"I never answered your question yesterday," I explained. "About Shinji, I mean."  
“我昨天没有回答你的问题，”我解释道，“关于真嗣的。”

I did a quick scan of the grounds. Hikari and Toji were on the roof, and Shinji and Kensuke were over by the fence above the pool, probably ogling the freshmen as they had PE.  
我迅速扫视了一下场地。比吕志和光在屋顶上，而真嗣和健介则靠在泳池上方的栅栏旁，大概是在偷看上体育课的新生们。

"I figured it might have something to do with that," Rei sighed. "Ever since I transferred in, that's all that I've been asked about."  
"我想这可能和那件事有关，"丽叹了口气。"自从我转学过来，大家问的都是这个。"

I picked up another piece of sushi with my chopsticks. We both chewed silently.  
我又用筷子夹起一块寿司。我们俩都默默地咀嚼着。

"Before I answer your question, I have to ask you one first," I went on. "Are you interested in him? You said you thought he was cute."  
"在我回答你的问题之前，我得先问你一个问题，"我继续说。"你对他的感觉如何？你说过你觉得他很可爱。"

"I don't really know the guy," she replied. "It'd probably be fun if we went out, but it's not like I'm in love with him or anything."  
"我其实不太了解他，"她回答道。"如果我们出去玩可能会很有趣，但并不是说我爱上他了或者什么的。"

"I mean, we just met," Rei summarized.  
"我的意思是，我们才刚认识，"丽总结道。"

I nodded. A basketball rolled towards us. I grabbed it and threw it back to the court.  
我点点头。一个篮球滚向我们。我捡起它，扔回了球场。

"You asked me what me and Shinji are," I started, choosing my words carefully. "It's… complicated. We've been best friends since forever, and there might be something there but…"  
"你问我我和真嗣是什么关系，" 我开始说，斟酌着用词。"这……挺复杂的。我们从记事起就是最好的朋友，也许有些什么，但……"

I paused again, trying to compose a better explanation.  
我又一次停顿，试图组织一个更好的解释。

"Everyone's always expected us to get together. I guess maybe I did too. None of the other girls ever went after him, because of that. I had all the time in the world to think about things. And then you transferred, and-"  
"大家都一直期待我们能在一起。我想也许我也这么想过。其他女孩从未追求过他，就是因为这个。我有的是时间去思考这些事。然后你转学来了，然后-"

"And you were scared that I was going to steal him away." Rei finished my sentence.  
"而你担心我会把他抢走。" 丽替我说完了这句话。

"Not steal," I corrected. "But I did get scared."  
"不是抢走，" 我纠正道，"但我确实感到害怕。"

I didn't know why I felt the need to say this in front of probably my biggest rival for Shinji.  
我不知道为什么我会在可能是我追求真嗣的最大竞争对手面前说出这些。

"I just don't want to screw our friendship up, but I don't want to lose him either. So that's my answer." I finished.  
"我只是不想破坏我们的友谊，但也不想失去他。所以这就是我的答案。" 我说完了。

We ate in silence as my entire speech sank in. I started watching the basketball game, not because I was interested, but because it was something to occupy my attention. We sat there until it was almost time to go back inside.  
我们默默地吃着，我的整个演讲慢慢沉淀。我开始看篮球比赛，不是因为我感兴趣，而是因为这是占据我注意力的事情。我们就这样坐着，直到差不多该回屋里去的时间。

"One week," Rei said. "一周，" 丽说。

"Pardon me?" I wasn't aware if I had missed something before that.  
"对不起，你说什么？" 我不确定自己是否在那之前遗漏了什么。

"I'll give you one week to figure it out, and then you can explain it to me. I wasn't planning on going out with him that soon anyway," Rei elaborated.  
"我给你一周时间去弄明白，然后你再向我解释。反正我也没打算那么快就和他出去，" 丽详细解释道。

It wasn't quite the answer I was hoping for, but it was more than fair. Not many girls would've stepped aside for another girl, even just for seven days.  
这并非我期望的确切答案，但已足够公平。很少有女孩会为了另一个女孩让步，哪怕只是七天。

"Thank you," I softly acknowledged.  
“谢谢你，”我轻声表示感谢。

An agreement reached, we packed up and went inside for the start of afternoon classes.  
达成共识后，我们收拾好东西，走进教室开始下午的课程。

The rest of our classmates filed in groups of two or three; Shinji, Toji, and Kensuke came in together. Oddly enough, they were silent, instead of chattering about the latest anime or something. They each took a look at me, almost at the same time, and quickly sat down.  
其他同学三三两两地进来；真嗣、薰和健介一起走了进来。奇怪的是，他们没有像往常一样谈论最新的动漫或其他什么，而是沉默不语。他们几乎同时看了我一眼，然后迅速坐下。

Subtle. 微妙。

Hikari was the last to come in – she had been crying, I could tell. If you weren't looking for it, you wouldn't have noticed it, but her eyes were a little puffy, and just a little red. She bolted for her chair, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone.  
光是最后一个进来的——我能看出她在哭。如果你不仔细看，可能不会注意到，但她的眼睛有点肿，还有点红。她冲向自己的座位，尽量避免与任何人眼神接触。

I glared at Toji, who fidgeted a little in his seat.  
我瞪着冬二，他坐在座位上有点不安地动了动。

"Alright class, time for math!"  
“好了，同学们，数学时间到！”

Math wasn't what I was concerned about right now. Hikari was.  
我现在担心的不是数学，而是光。

It was no use trying to message her on the computers: Hikari, the perfect student, never used her laptop for anything but taking notes. Instead, I always had to wait for her to look my way to communicate in class.  
在电脑上给她发消息是没用的：作为完美学生的光，除了记笔记外从不在笔记本上做其他事。因此，我总是得等她看向我这边才能在课堂上交流。

_Are you okay?_ I mouthed, when she finally turned her head towards me.  
你还好吗？当她终于转头看向我时，我无声地说道。

_Later_. She mouthed back, before looking ahead to the front of the class.  
待会儿再说。她回了个口型，然后又看向前排的讲台。

For once, I cursed not sitting with Hikari – as class rep, she had to sit at the front, and I hated sitting at the front. Teachers only saw the troublemakers at the front. Besides, Shinji and I usually sat together.  
这一回，我倒没抱怨没和光坐在一起——作为班长，她得坐在前排，而我讨厌坐前排。老师们只看到前排的捣蛋鬼。再说了，我和真嗣通常是坐一块儿的。

It was obvious that Hikari was crying because of something his idiotic friend had done, though. Hikari confirmed it after school, when she started crying immediately as we went into the Girls' washroom. It wasn't full-blown sobbing, but tears were flowing down her cheeks.  
很明显，光是因为他那蠢朋友做了什么才哭的。放学后，光证实了这一点，我们一进女洗手间，她立刻就哭了起来。虽然不是嚎啕大哭，但泪水已经顺着她的脸颊流了下来。

"Before I had a chance to say anything, he told me that he had to tell me something: he said that he only liked me as a friend," Hikari sniffed, wiping her face with a wad of toilet paper. It was a good thing she didn't wear make-up, or her mascara would've been ruined.  
“我还没来得及说什么，他就告诉我他必须告诉我一件事：他说他只把我当朋友，”光抽泣着，用一团卫生纸擦脸。还好她没化妆，不然睫毛膏肯定全毁了。

"That jerk doesn't deserve you," I scowled.  
“那个混蛋配不上你，”我皱眉道。

"No, he was really nice about it." Hikari took a shaky breath and continued. "He said that we've known each other too long, and that he didn't have those types of feelings for me. Then he apologized again, and we hugged. He said he really hoped we could still be friends."  
“不，他处理得很好。”光莉颤抖地吸了口气，继续说，“他说我们认识太久了，他对我没有那种感觉。然后他又道了歉，我们拥抱了一下。他说他真心希望我们还能做朋友。”

Hikari blew her nose on the wad and threw it out. I grabbed another handful of toilet paper and offered it to her.  
光莉用那团纸擤了鼻涕，然后扔掉了。我抓了一把新的卫生纸递给她。

"Well, he doesn't know what he's missing," I tried to console her. "Plenty of other guys out there would kill to go out with you." It was a cliché of a comfort line, but I didn't know what else to say. Toji wouldn't have been my choice for a boyfriend, but he wasn't exactly the worst guy in the school. I was actually surprised that he was kind enough to let Hikari down that gently.  
"嗯，他不知道自己错过了什么，"我试图安慰她。"还有很多其他男生愿意和你约会呢。" 这虽然是一句老套的安慰话，但我不知道还能说什么。东治不会是我的男朋友选择，但他也不是学校里最糟糕的家伙。实际上，他这么温柔地拒绝光，让我有点惊讶。

"I'll be alright," Hikari gave me a weak smile, taking the paper and dabbing at her eyes a bit. Her tears had mostly stopped.  
"我会没事的，"光给了我一个虚弱的微笑，拿起纸巾轻轻擦拭眼睛。她的眼泪已经基本止住了。

"Do you regret it?" I asked.  
"你后悔吗？"我问道。

"Right now I do," she shuddered after replying.  
“现在是的。”她回答后不禁打了个寒颤。

"But it's like you said. At least this way I get my question answered." Hikari looked at herself in the mirror, straightening her hair a bit.  
"但就像你说的，至少这样我能得到答案。" 光看着镜子里的自己，稍微整理了一下头发。

"Now, I can start to get over him."  
"现在，我可以开始忘记他了。"

I gave her a hug, and we started walking out to the schoolyard.  
我给了她一个拥抱，然后我们开始向校园走去。

Shinji had already left with Kensuke and Rei. It was a Saturday afternoon, and most of the school had cleared out to get started on their weekend plans.  
真嗣已经和健介、绫一起离开了。那是一个周六的下午，大多数学生都已离校，开始他们的周末计划。

I walked Hikari to the gate. Toji had finished his class duty, and was waiting for us at the gate.  
我陪着光走到校门口。当麻已经完成了他的班级值日，正在门口等我们。

"Hi Hikari," he greeted my friend, ignoring me completely. "Can I walk you home?  
"“嗨，光，”他向我的朋友打招呼，完全无视了我。“我可以送你回家吗？”

I gave Hikari one of my "are you sure about this" looks, and she nodded. I grabbed Toji and pulled him aside, as Hikari watched.  
我给了光一个“你确定吗”的眼神，她点了点头。我抓住了真嗣，把他拉到一旁，光在一旁看着。

"Look, idiot," I hissed, "let's get one thing clear. You already hurt her once today. I don't want to hear about you doing something else stupid, or you'll be answering to me, got it?"  
“听着，白痴，”我低声说道，“我们先说清楚一件事。你今天已经伤害过她一次了。我不想再听到你做出什么蠢事，否则你得向我交代，明白吗？”

I raised a fist to make my point. Either he was scared, or embarrassed about what had happened, because he nodded, without even trying to argue with me.  
我举起拳头来强调我的观点。他要么是害怕，要么是因为发生的事情感到尴尬，因为他点了点头，甚至没有试图和我争辩。

"I wasn't planning to, Red Devil," he countered, with no bite behind the usual nickname. "And while we're talking about not hurting friends, you need to talk to Shinji."  
"我原本没打算这么做，红魔，" 他回应道，语气中没有了往常昵称背后的锋芒。"既然我们谈到了不伤害朋友，你得和真嗣谈谈。"

"I know," I conceded. "You fix things with her, and I'll fix things with Shinji. Deal?"  
"我知道，" 我承认道。"你和她和好，我来和真嗣和好。成交？"

"Deal." "成交。"

Our conversation over, we walked back to Hikari. I hugged her, made her promise to call me on the weekend if she needed, gave her another hug, and then we each went our separate ways.  
我们的对话结束后，我们走回了光那里。我拥抱了她，让她答应如果周末需要就给我打电话，又给了她一个拥抱，然后我们各自分道扬镳。

I looked back at them as they walked down the street, the two figures looking away from each other, not with any malice or like a fighting couple, but more like two people who didn't have anything to say to each other. They took turns looking at each other with the other's head turned, and rounded the corner.  
我回头看着他们沿着街道走去，两个身影彼此背对着，并非出于恶意或像争吵的情侣，而更像是两个无话可说的人。他们轮流在对方转头时看向彼此，然后转过街角。

The sun was already setting by the time I got back to the apartment. I had just put my schoolbag down when the doorbell rang.  
当我回到公寓时，太阳已经快落山了。我刚放下书包，门铃就响了。

Shinji was at the door, with two bags of what appeared to be food. It was the first time all day we had talked to each other, much less given each other direct eye contact. He was a little hesitant when I opened the door, worried that I was about to snap.  
真嗣站在门口，手里提着两个袋子，看起来像是食物。一整天以来，我们第一次交谈，甚至有了直接的眼神接触。我开门时，他显得有些犹豫，担心我会突然发火。

"Hi," he said, fairly subdued. "My mom sent me with this stuff for you – I'm not entirely sure what it was."  
“嗨，”他相当低调地说，“我妈让我带这些东西给你——我不太确定是什么。”

He looked like he was giving me a bomb about to go off, preparing to run away from the ensuing explosion.  
他看起来像是在递给我一个即将爆炸的炸弹，准备随时逃离随之而来的爆炸。

"Well, I'll just leave you alone now," he turned to leave.  
"好吧，我现在就让你一个人待着，"他转身准备离开。

"Wait, Shinji," I reached out to grab his shoulder and pull him back.  
"等等，真嗣，"我伸出手抓住他的肩膀，把他拉了回来。

"Asuka-" “明日香——”

"I'm sorry," I cut him off. "I've just been in a bad mood today, and I sort of took it out on you."  
"对不起，" 我打断了他。"我今天心情不好，有点把气撒在你身上了。"

He looked relieved, certain now that he didn't do anything to deserve my wrath.  
他看起来松了一口气，确信自己并没有做什么该受我怒气的事。

"Asuka, it's alright, really," he replied.  
"明日香，没事的，真的，" 他回答道。"

"No, it isn't," I said. "I'll make it up to you right now - want to stay for dinner? I can't possibly eat all of this by myself."  
"不，不是的，" 我说。"我现在就补偿你——想留下来吃晚饭吗？我一个人可吃不了这么多。"

"Sure," he replied. smiling.  
"当然，" 他笑着回答。"

He went into the living room to call his mom to let her know he'd be eating here, as I took the food into the kitchen. Shinji's mom had packed a bunch of rice balls (my favourite, she knew), and some sliced meat and vegetables, and that was only one bag.  
他走进客厅给妈妈打电话，告诉她他会在这里吃饭，而我则把食物拿到厨房。真嗣的妈妈打包了许多饭团（她知道这是我最喜欢的），还有一些切好的肉和蔬菜，而这还只是一袋。

I put some water to boil for tea (Japanese tea leaves this time), and took the food out of the packages. Shinji came into the kitchen.  
我烧了些水准备泡茶（这次是日本茶叶），并把食物从包装中取出。真嗣走进了厨房。

"Need any help?" “需要帮忙吗？”

"Sure, you can start setting the table," I ordered.  
“当然，你可以开始摆桌子，”我吩咐道。

He opened the dishwasher and started grabbing dishes and chopsticks.  
他打开洗碗机，开始抓取盘子和筷子。

In retrospect, I knew exactly what I was doing, and what might happen, from the moment I invited him inside. No matter how scared I was, my curiosity wouldn't be denied. I was going to find out exactly what he felt for me tonight, and what I felt for him – that was the plan, at the very least.  
回想起来，从我邀请他进屋的那一刻起，我就清楚自己在做什么，以及可能会发生什么。无论我有多害怕，我的好奇心都无法被压制。我今晚一定要弄清楚他对我的感觉，以及我对他的感觉——至少这是我的计划。

Almost reflexively, I came up behind him as he set the plate onto the table, and leaned over dangerously close, resting my chin on his shoulder as my arms slid around his chest. I could feel him stiffen up a bit, as he realized what I started to do.  
几乎是本能反应，当他把盘子放在桌上时，我走到他身后，危险地靠近，下巴搭在他的肩上，双臂环抱住他的胸膛。我能感觉到他意识到我要做什么时身体微微僵硬。

My body was pretty stiff too, I realized, as my brain started to exhibit rational thought again. I was quivering a bit – if I was actually going to do this, it had to be quick, before my nerves got the better of me. His head tilted around to meet mine, and I started to close the small gap separating our mouths, inch by agonizing inch.  
我也意识到自己的身体相当僵硬，当我的大脑开始恢复理性思考时。我微微颤抖着——如果我真的要这么做，就必须迅速行动，趁我的神经还没完全占据上风。他的头转向我，我便开始缩短我们唇间那段微小的距离，一寸寸地，痛苦地逼近。

Not nearly quick enough, because I stopped ever-so-close. Just quick enough, as he surprised me by leaning in the last little bit to press his lips to mine.  
还不够快，因为我几乎停了下来。但足够迅速，因为他最后时刻出乎意料地倾身，将他的唇贴上了我的。

It wasn't a deep kiss, not at first – almost like one of those friendly pecks, as we both weren't sure how far to take this. Then we started getting into it, after the initial shock of "this is happening" wore off. At some point, I felt his arms pull me in tighter.  
起初并不是深吻——几乎像是那种友好的轻吻，因为我们都不确定该进行到哪一步。然后，在最初的“这正在发生”的震惊消退后，我们开始投入其中。在某一刻，我感觉到他的手臂将我拉得更紧。

That's when I reacted. 就在那时，我做出了反应。

"I think you should go," I said, pulling back. His expression was curiously blank – a bit shocked at how fast things just moved?  
"我觉得你应该走，" 我说着，往后退了一步。他的表情出奇地空白——有点震惊于事情进展得如此迅速？

I just couldn't go through with it, Shinji, I wanted to say. I don't want us to turn out like Hikari and Toji, tension between us whenever we're together, too scared to talk to each other because we screwed up as more than friends. And I can't be around you without wanting you to hold me again like that and kiss me again.  
我实在无法继续下去了，真嗣，我本想这么说。我不希望我们变得像光和剑介那样，每次在一起都充满紧张，太害怕彼此交谈，因为我们作为朋友以上的关系搞砸了。而我无法在你身边而不希望你再次那样拥抱我，再次亲吻我。

"Okay." A trace of disappointment, now. Or was that just me hoping for one? My mind ran through the words I wanted to say.  
"好吧。" 一丝失望的痕迹，现在。还是那只是我一厢情愿的期待？我的脑海中闪过那些我想说的话。

I'm sorry, Shinji. I can't risk this. Not right now. Not when I can barely figure out which possibility I want for us. And not when I'm unsure why I'm doing this. Not yet.  
对不起，真嗣。我不能冒这个险。不是现在。不是在我还无法确定我们之间想要哪种可能性的时候。也不是在我还不确定自己为什么要这么做的时候。还不是时候。

I couldn't speak, or bring myself to look at him as he left.  
我无法开口，也无法让自己看着他离开。

The door closed softly.  
门轻轻地关上了。

**Author's Notes: 作者的话：**

I'm settling into a sort of monthly rhythm for writing, in case anyone's actually wondering how often I update, that's a heads-up. Part of being a writer, at least I find, is that you tend to get a bunch of ideas for stories that you can't help but start and try to develop. And then before you know it, you have a bunch of things in various stages of completion, before you realize some of them just don't work, and will never see the light of day (or in this case, the light of the internet).  
我正逐渐适应一种每月一次的写作节奏，以防有人真的好奇我更新频率，这里先打个招呼。作为作家，至少我发现，你往往会得到一堆故事创意，忍不住开始并尝试发展。然后不知不觉中，你手头就有了许多处于不同完成阶段的作品，直到你意识到其中一些根本行不通，永远不会见天日（或者在这种情况下，不会见互联网之光）。

It's like fiction-ADD. That said, I don't plan to leave anything unfinished (yes, I intend on returning to writing BtEO after this).  
这就像是小说注意力缺失症。话虽如此，我不打算留下任何未完成的作品（是的，我打算在这之后继续写《BtEO》）。

A few minor continuity notes here – I almost made the mistake of calling the school a high school (and mixed up the seniors, juniors, etc.) Looking back at the first chapter, I only mentioned that it was a high school in the author's notes (which was a mistake). In fact, Japanese high school goes from grades 10-12, so the Evangelion pilots are actually seniors at a middle school. Also, school in Japan runs five or six days a week, depending on the school. Oops.  
这里有一些小的连续性注释——我差点犯了个错误，把学校称为高中（还混淆了高年级、低年级等）。回顾最初的chapter，我只提到那是一所高中，是在作者注释里（这是个错误）。实际上，日本的高中是从 10 年级到 12 年级，所以《EVA》的驾驶员们其实是初中高年级的学生。另外，日本的学校每周上课五天或六天，具体取决于学校。哎呀。

Rice balls are called onigiri – they're fairly sizable, and widely available in Japan.  
饭团在日本被称为'お握り'（onigiri），它们体积相当大，在日本各地都很常见。

The Yokohama Baystars are a Japanese baseball team in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league – they play in the same prefecture as Hokone (where Tokyo-3 is supposed to be). The Yomiuri Giants are also a Japanese baseball team, sort of the New York Yankees of Japanese baseball. No Second Impact also means that Japanese baseball teams are pretty much the same in 2015.  
横滨 Baystars 是日本职业棒球联盟中的一支日本棒球队——他们的主场与箱根（东京-3 所在地）位于同一县。读卖巨人队也是一支日本棒球队，可以说是日本棒球界的纽约洋基队。没有第二次冲击也意味着 2015 年的日本棒球队基本上保持不变。

Finally, Japan doesn't have Daylight Savings Time – hence, the sunset at 5ish.  
最后，日本不实行夏令时——因此，日落时间大约在五点左右。

Sorry if it wasn't clear in the first chapter, but I do intend to continue this; it's not just a one-shot. That would've been a pretty crappy ending to the first chapter on my part if I ended it on "Shinji and Asuka talk about Rei", no?  
如果在前 1001 章中不够明确，我在此道歉，但我确实打算继续这个故事；它不仅仅是一个短篇。如果我在“真嗣和明日香谈论丽”这一章就草草结束，那对我来说第一 1002 章的结局就太糟糕了，不是吗？

Instead, maybe I'll end the story on "Shinji and Asuka talk about getting together", or "Shinji and Rei get together", or maybe "Asuka and Rei get together…"  
相反，也许我会以“真嗣和明日香谈论在一起”，或者“真嗣和丽在一起”，甚至可能是“明日香和丽在一起……”来结束这个故事。

Asuka/Toji, anyone? 有人喜欢明日香/冬二这对吗？

Then again, who says anyone has to get together?  
不过话说回来，谁说一定要有人在一起呢？
