Elsa Bibat made this little challenge, you see, to include a fewselect paragraphs that she had written into a fic-any series, anycharacters, as long as it contained those lines. This had been justafter I had made a few inquiries about Shinji-Asuka fics, and thoselines just screamed at me... As it turned out, after the initial piece,I decided to re-write the section, to better suit the needs of thisstory. Still, because it was that bit which got the story to gel, I'veincluded it at the end. You'll be able to see easily where it fit in atfirst.  
艾尔莎·比巴特（Elsa Bibat）提出了这个小小的挑战，你看，她把她写成小说的几个精选段落包括在内——任何系列，任何角色，只要它包含这些台词。这是在我询问了一些关于真嗣-明日香小说之后，那些台词只是对我尖叫......事实证明，在最初的文章之后，我决定重写这一部分，以更好地适应这个故事的需要。不过，因为正是那一点让故事变得凝固，所以我把它放在了最后。首先，您将能够轻松看到它的位置。

This story is set before, during, and after the attack of the 15thAngel. In other words, this diverges around the 22nd episode, I think.Yep, that's right. Spoilers inherent, and you have to be familiar withthat Angel to know what's going on and why Asuka reacts the way shedoes...  
这个故事发生在第 15 天使袭击之前、期间和之后。换句话说，我认为这在第 22 集左右有所不同。是的，没错。剧透是固有的，你必须熟悉那个天使才能知道发生了什么，以及为什么明日香会做出这样的反应......

We were out of food.  
我们没有食物了。

And I most certainly did _not_ want Misato shopping for groceries.Somehow, Asuka and I had agreed on that, and she decided to accompanyme. It seemed a good idea at the time... But so many things seem to begood ideas at first.  
而且我当然不想让美里买杂货。不知怎的，明日香和我达成了一致，她决定陪我一起去。这在当时似乎是个好主意......但很多事情一开始似乎是好主意。

"Why don't we ever go get some _normal_ food? You know, like...oh, ofcourse you wouldn't know what normal food is. All this rice must gostraight to your head..."  
“我们为什么不去吃一些普通的食物呢？你知道，就像......哦，你当然不会知道什么是普通食物。这些米饭都得直奔你的头......”

It all continued through our trip to the store, through the storeitself, through the checkout line-the whole time. Dammit, she can be soannoying.  
这一切都贯穿了我们去商店的旅程，通过商店本身，通过结账线——一直如此。该死的，她可能很烦人。

I tried to tune her out. Really I did. Think about the stars, theclouds, the-  
我试着把她调出来。我真的做到了。想想星星，云彩，——

whap^^^ "Are you listening to me?"  
呜^^^ “你在听我说话吗？”

Well, _that_ didn't work. "Would you just leave me alone? And whycan't you just get used to Japanese food, huh? Geez!"  
好吧，_那个_没有用。“你就放过我吗？为什么你不能习惯日本料理，对吧？哎呀！

"'Cos I'm SICK of noodles and rice and fish. Where's the pork chops orsausages? I mean..." I don't know how she manages to do it, but shepitched her voice just right so that it grated in the worst possible wayon my nerves.  
“因为我厌倦了面条、米饭和鱼。猪排奥萨肠在哪里？我的意思是......”我不知道她是怎么做到的，但她的声音恰到好处，以至于它以最糟糕的方式刺痛了我的神经。

"...I don't even know why I put up with you, you whiny, weak littleboy..."  
"...我什至不知道我为什么要忍受你，你这个抱怨，软弱的小男孩......”

NOW she was getting personal. When I realizd that I was starting totwitch, I tried tuning her out again. I think she paused in her tiradeas we passed a clothing store...I don't know. My mind was still on thecool night air, the rustle of leaves, the moonlight...  
现在她变得个人化了。当我意识到我开始抽搐时，我试着再次把她调出来。我想她在长篇大论中停顿了一下，我们路过一家服装店......我不知道。我的思绪仍然在凉爽的夜风、树叶的沙沙声、月光上......

The moonlight. The full moon has always been said to do weird thingsto people. That must be it...  
月光。人们一直说满月会给人带来奇怪的事情。那一定是它......

As much as I tried, her incessant nagging as we were walking home justgot to me, finally. It had been bad enough when she was just generallycomplaining, but the personal barbs-what had she called me this time,an "immature idiot who shouldn't have qualified as a pilot"-were justgetting to be too much. I turned towards her, opened my mouth, and thensimply froze there.  
尽管我尽了努力，但在我们回家的路上，她不停地唠叨终于抓住了我。当她只是一般地抱怨时，这已经够糟糕的了，但个人的倒钩——这次她怎么称呼我，一个“不成熟的白痴，不应该有资格成为一名飞行员”——实在是太过分了。我转向她，张开嘴，然后就僵在了那里。

The way that silver light played across her hair. The way itaccentuated the delicate line of her jaw, even as it bobbed up and downwhile she yammered in a most unromantic manner. The way it reflected offher blue eyes, shining in the darkness, with the luminescence of...ofsomething more powerful than I can manage to describe.  
银光在她的头发上打转的方式。它突出了她下巴的精致线条，即使它上下摆动，而她以一种最不浪漫的方式打哈欠。它从她的蓝眼睛上反射出来的方式，在黑暗中闪闪发光，发出......比我所能描述的更强大的东西。

She was beautiful.  
她很漂亮。

I think, by this time, she had stopped complaining, and was asking mesomething. What was it? It was somewhere along the lines of, "Hello? Areyou in there? Hello?" I believe she was also waving her hand in frontof my face.  
我想，到这个时候，她已经停止了抱怨，而是在问我一些事情。它是什么？大概是这样的，“你好？你在里面吗？你好？我相信她也在我面前挥手。

Instead of answering, I took her by the shoulders, pulled her close-  
我没有回答，而是抓住她的肩膀，把她拉近——

"Heh-what are you dommmMMPH!"  
“呵呵——你干嘛！”

-and kissed her on the mouth.  
-并亲吻了她的嘴。

I guess it did achieve my original goal of shutting her up.  
我想它确实实现了我最初让她闭嘴的目标。

Somehow, I still remember the details. I felt her muscles go extremelytense. I felt her moist lips trembling a bit against my own. I felt herhair brushing against my face slightly. I felt her heartbeat suddenlyquicken...  
不知何故，我仍然记得细节。我感觉到她的肌肉变得非常紧张。我感觉到她湿润的嘴唇在我自己的唇上颤抖着。我感觉到她的头发轻轻地拂过我的脸。我感觉到她的心跳突然加快了......

I also heard the plastic bag of groceries, the one that had beendangling in her right hand, go crash^^^ on the ground. That broke thespell. I suddenly remembered where I was. More importantly, I suddenlyrealized where I was relative to Asuka. I think my own surprise then wasat least as great as hers when I'd first kissed her.  
我还听见她右手晃来晃去的杂货塑料袋摔在地上^^^。这打破了魔咒。我突然想起了我在哪里。更重要的是，我突然意识到我与明日香的关系。我想我自己的惊讶至少和我第一次吻她时一样大。

I must have been possessed.  
我一定是被附身了。

I stepped back, looking at her face, illuminated by the moonlight. Onher pretty features, shadowed just a bit by her long hair, I saw thetail end of her shock and surprise, saw it change to a bit of reddishembarrassment, and then suddenly to anger. But there had-  
我往后退了一步，看着她的脸，被月光照亮了。在她俏丽的五官上，只被她的长发遮住了一点点，我看到了她的震惊和惊讶的尾巴末端，看到它变成了一点红色的尴尬，然后突然变成了愤怒。但是有——

slap*

"You pervert," Asuka hissed. She picked up her bag and ran off back tothe apartment complex. I gathered myself enough to pick up my bag offood-I had dropped mine somewhere along the way, too, it seemed-absently rubbing the spot on my cheek where her palm had connected.  
“你这个，”明日香嘶嘶作响。她拿起包，跑回公寓大楼。我鼓起勇气捡起我的那袋食物——我在路上也把我的食物丢在了某个地方，它似乎——心不在焉地揉了揉我脸颊上她手掌连接的地方。

But what was that...that touch of terrible sadness that had flashed onher face, between the embarrassment and anger?  
但那是什么......她脸上闪过的那一丝可怕的悲伤，介于尴尬和愤怒之间？

I began to run after her.  
我开始追她。

-Dinner passed most uncomfortably. Asuka refused to look at me, Iremember. How I managed to realize that was strange, because it seemedlike I couldn't bring myself to look at her, either.  
-晚餐过得很不舒服。明日香拒绝看我，我记得。我怎么会意识到这很奇怪，因为我似乎也无法让自己去看她。

Misato was drunk, though, so that was okay. I don't think she noticeda thing, including how badly she had cooked the vegetables.  
不过，美里喝醉了，所以没关系。我不认为她注意到了什么，包括她把蔬菜煮得有多糟糕。

The rest of the night was much the same-a general avoidance of eachother on both our parts, and nonstop mulling over what had happened...onmy part, at least. I eventually found my way to bed, evidently afterwatching some TV and finishing some homework-and I swear I don't recalldoing either thing.  
那天晚上剩下的时间都差不多——我们双方都普遍回避对方，不停地思考发生了什么......至少在我身上。我最终找到了上床睡觉的路，显然是在看了一些电视并完成了一些家庭作业之后——我发誓我不记得做过这两件事。

I stared at the ceiling of my bedroom, seeing Asuka's face as she hadstood there, in the moonlight, just before I kissed her. And I saw thatinstant of deep melancholy that had danced across her features, soquickly...  
我盯着卧室的天花板，看到明日香的脸，她站在月光下，就在我吻她之前。我看到那一瞬间深深的忧郁在她的五官上跳舞，如此迅速......

I was going to be an absolute basketcase in the morning. I hate notbeing able to sleep. It certainly wasn't coming now. Finally, I decidedto get this over with, and go to talk with Asuka. I figured that she hadto be as bothered by this as I was. I was hoping she was, at least.  
早上我绝对会成为一个篮子。我讨厌无法入睡。它现在肯定不会到来。最后，我决定结束这一切，去和明日香谈谈。我想她一定和我一样为此烦恼。我希望她至少是这样。

Stealthily, I crept out of my room, past Misato's-her light was stillon, so I had to be careful-and arrived at Asuka's door. I gave asurreptitious knock, more intent on keeping my passage secret fromMisato than alerting Asuka to my presence. I opened the door and walkedin.  
我悄悄地走出了我的房间，经过美里的灯——她的灯还亮着，所以我必须小心——来到了明日香的门口。我偷偷地敲了敲门，与其说是提醒明日香我的存在，不如说是想对美里保密。我打开门走了进去。

"Asuka," I began, "we gotta tal..."  
“明日香，”我开始说，“我们得......”

She was asleep.  
她睡着了。

I stared. After something as momentous as that kiss, and she had thepeace of mind to sleep? Perhaps I was being a little egotisical, but aslightly irrational anger took over me. Goddammit, how did she get overthat so easily? Looked like she was comfortable enough to not stay upand agonize over stuff. Fine, if you care so little about it all, then Iwon't care either. I stiffly turned to go out the door.  
我瞪大了眼睛。在经历了像那个吻这样重要的事情之后，她安心入睡了吗？也许我有点自负，但有点非理性的愤怒占据了我。该死的，她怎么这么容易就克服了？看起来她很舒服，不会熬夜和为事情而苦恼。好吧，如果你对这一切这么不在乎，那我也不会在乎。我僵硬地转身走出门。

"No..." whimpered a voice behind me.The word "no" can be extremely powerful, whether shouted in acommanding tone of voice or just barely whispered. Sometimes, though, itis the whisper that has much more force.  
“不......”一个声音在我身后呜咽。“不”这个词可以非常有力量，无论是用命令的语气喊出来，还是只是勉强低声说出来。不过，有时，耳语的力量要大得多。

Asuka whimpered in her sleep again.  
明日香又在睡梦中呜咽起来。

This could have been deja vu, except that I knew it had indeedhappened to me once already... Memories of one night long ago flashedthrough my mind. I had almost kissed her then. "Mama," she hadwhispered, and a single tear had crept out of her eye. She was just achild. Just a child...  
这可能是似曾相识的，但我知道它确实已经发生在我身上一次了......很久以前的一个晚上的记忆在我脑海中闪过。那时我几乎吻了她。「媽媽，」她低聲說，一滴眼淚從她的眼睛裡溜出來。她只是个孩子。只是个孩子......

How remarkably inconvenient. I had been ready to stalk back to my roomin righteous indignation and get some rest, and here she had to go,giving me a need to stay. I should have been slightly miffed.  
多么不方便。我义愤填膺地准备偷偷溜回我的房间休息一下，她不得不走了，让我需要留下来。我应该有点生气。

I gently stepped my way through her small piles of clothes, nudging acollege-level physics book out of the way, and sat down cross-leggednext to her bed. She was lying on her side, hands clasping her thinblanket to her chest. I could see the drying trail of a tear that hadrun along her cheek and looked to have soaked into a lock of her hair,rakishly draped over her face. Again, she whispered, "No..." She hadthat inexplicably sorrowful look on her face, though somewhat subdued.  
我轻轻地穿过她的一小堆衣服，把一本大学水平的物理书推开，然后盘腿坐在她的床边。她侧躺着，双手紧紧攥着薄毯子在胸前。我能看到一滴眼泪沿着她的脸颊流淌，似乎已经浸透了她的一绺头发，粗犷地披在她的脸上。她又低声说：“不......”她的脸上有一种莫名其妙的悲伤表情，虽然有些压抑。

I'll stay until her nightmare is over, I remember thinking. I'd watchover her for that, then I'd go back to bed. I reached over and gentlyflipped the strands of hair back over her shoulder. She moved suddenly,scaring me half to death, but remained asleep. I sat back again, staringat this face so innocent, so beautiful, so vulnerable. I was completelymesmerized again.  
我会一直待到她的噩梦结束，我记得当时在想。我会照看她，然后我会回去睡觉。我伸手过去，轻轻地把一缕头发甩回她的肩膀上。她突然动了，把我吓得半死，但仍然睡着了。我又坐了下来，盯着这张脸，那么天真，那么美丽，那么脆弱。我又完全被迷住了。

Actually, it was probably that I fell asleep, because the next thing Iknew, an alarm was ringing loudly. I was groggy-for a moment. I veryquickly realized my position: sitting in Asuka's bedroom while she hadbeen sleeping. I tried to jump up and run out while I still had thechance, but as luck would have it, both my legs had fallen asleep.  
实际上，可能是我睡着了，因为我知道的下一件事，闹钟响得很响。我昏昏沉沉地呆了一会儿。我很快意识到我的位置：坐在明日香的卧室里，而她一直在睡觉。我试着趁着还有机会跳起来跑出去，但幸运的是，我的两条腿都睡着了。

An arm reached out of the mass of pillow, blanket, chestnut-coloredhair, and pajamas to smash down on the alarm clock. She had apparentlyrolled over during the night; with the clock being closer to me than thewall that she now faced, the strike wasn't quite on target and knockedthe timepiece off the nightstand-and right into my face.  
一只胳膊从一大堆枕头、毯子、栗色的头发和睡衣中伸出，砸在闹钟上。她显然在夜里翻了个身;由于时钟离我比她现在面对的墙更近，这一击没有完全击中目标，把钟表从床头柜上撞了下来——正好撞到了我的脸上。

"Ow!"

Oops.

The mass of cloth and hair pushed itself apart to reveal a stillsleepy Asuka, who turned to look at me. She blinked. And she blinkedagain.  
一大堆布料和头发被推开，露出仍然昏昏欲睡的明日香，他转过身来看着我。她眨了眨眼。她又眨了眨眼。

I imagine that my face was locked into a rictus of horrified panic.  
我想象着我的脸被锁定在惊恐的恐慌中。

She spoke slowly, as if trying to figure out whether or not this wasstill a dream. "Is that you, Shinji?"  
她语速缓慢，仿佛在想弄清楚这是否还是一场梦。“是你吗，真嗣？”

I croaked, not finding my voice for a few seconds. Finally I gave upand simply nodded. Somewhere along the way, I realized that there wasblood returning to my legs. The prickling sensations added to my quicklyincreasing discomfort.  
我呱呱叫着，几秒钟都找不到自己的声音。最后我放弃了，只是点了点头。在路上的某个地方，我意识到我的腿上有血。刺痛的感觉增加了我迅速增加的不适感。

Still speaking slowly, but perhaps more like in a manner meant topacify a possibly dangerous animal, she asked, "Why are you in here?"  
她仍然说得很慢，但也许更像是在安抚一只可能危险的动物，她问道：“你为什么在这里？

My panic was rising at a constant rate. It looked like she wasbecoming more and more awake with every passing moment. I managed toclear my throat adequately to answer. "Wanted...wanted to talk toyou...you were asleep. Having...having a nightmare. I, I couldn't leaveyou alone." Repeating the first word of every sentence, eh? I was atleast as nervous as the time that I had stumbled on Ayanami _that_ time.I also wasn't sure if saying that much was a good idea, but what elsecould I do?  
我的恐慌情绪不断上升。看起来她每时每刻都变得越来越清醒。我设法清了清嗓子来回答。“通缉......想和你谈谈...你睡着了。拥有...做噩梦。我，我不能丢下你一个人。重复每个句子的第一个单词，嗯？我至少和我偶然发现绫波的时候一样紧张。我也不确定说这么多是不是一个好主意，但我还能做什么呢？

A look of slight surprise washed over her face, followed by someembarrassment, ending in anger...and again flitting through that visageof incredible forlornness. What could that possibly be?  
她的脸上露出一丝惊讶的表情，然后是一些尴尬，最后是愤怒......再一次掠过那张难以置信的孤独的面孔。那可能是什么？

My musings were cut off by a pillow to the face.  
我的沉思被枕头打断了。

"GET OUT!" she shouted. I obeyed, scrambling on all fours, stubbing atoe on her physics book, knocking her clothes all over the place, andfinally making it out the door. I shut it behind me with a gasp for air.  
“滚出去！”她喊道。我服从了，四肢着地爬起来，在她的物理书上踩着，把她的衣服打得满地都是，最后走出了门。我喘着粗气把它关在身后。

Air? I must have been holding my breath. I panted a bit while rubbing mytingling legs. Behind the door, I could hear her snap out at me, "Idon't need you or your sympathy!"  
空气？我一定是屏住了呼吸。我一边揉着发麻的腿，一边喘着粗气。在门后，我能听到她对我大声说：“我不需要你，也不需要你的同情！

This was not a good start to the day.  
这不是一个好的开始。

-

I still wonder about that night.  
我仍然想知道那天晚上。

Sure, I had felt attracted to her in the past. She was the prettiestgirl in the whole class... But she was so annoying, too. Always sosuperior...  
当然，我过去曾被她吸引过。她是全班最漂亮的女生......但她也很烦人。总是那么优越......

But when she was nice, she could be very nice.  
但是当她很好的时候，她可以很好。

And when she was vulnerable, she was so very vulnerable.  
当她脆弱的时候，她非常脆弱。

And I couldn't leave her, could I?  
我不能离开她，不是吗？

I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away...

What about the kiss? We had kissed once before, and for the most part,that had been really unpleasant. And of course, she had to pinch my noseshut because my breathing was tickling her. Yeh, let me turn blue so shewouldn't feel uncomfortable. So why did I kiss her? I mean, this is methat I'm talking about. Ikari Shinji. I know I don't have a history ofgreat bravery in any and all things. Why?  
吻呢？我们以前接吻过一次，而且在大多数情况下，这真的很不愉快。当然，她不得不捏住我的鼻子，因为我的呼吸让她发痒。是的，让我变蓝，这样她就不会感到不舒服了。那我为什么要吻她呢？我的意思是，这就是我正在谈论的我。伊卡里真嗣。我知道我在任何事情上都没有非常勇敢的历史。为什么？

I still don't know.  
我还是不知道。

-

I stared at the monitors in an impotent fury. That Angel was attackingAsuka's mind, and I couldn't do anything. Father wouldn't release thefreeze on Unit 01.  
我无力地盯着显示器。那个天使正在攻击明日香的思想，我什么也做不了。父亲不会释放01号机组的冻结。

"NO! NO! I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER THOSE THINGS! I WANT TO FORGET!"  
“不！不！我不想记住那些事情！我想忘记！

Her words, coming through the comm, hammered into my head. I was soangry, I felt like vomiting. I couldn't do anything. Dammit, I couldn'tdo anything!  
她的话，从通讯中传来，敲进了我的脑海。我很生气，我想呕吐。我什么都做不了。该死的，我什么都做不了！

"Don't look into my mind...STOP! STOP!"  
“不要看我的心思......停！住手！

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was crying from sheer rage.It's hurting her, and I can't do anything. Had to avoid the chance ofUnit 01 being contaminated, Father said.  
我当时没有意识到，但我因愤怒而哭泣。这伤害了她，我什么也做不了。父亲说，必须避免01号机组被污染的机会。

How I hate him sometimes. How I hate myself sometimes.  
我有时多么讨厌他。我有时多么讨厌自己。

The only reason that I wasn't going after Father to force him to letme go was that he allowed Rei to go get something called the LanceaLongini, to take care of the Angel.  
我没有去找父亲强迫他放我走的唯一原因是他允许 Rei 去拿一种叫做 LanceaLongini 的东西来照顾天使。

I saw Unit 00 come out of the ground, holding a two-pronged spear,and taking up a position slightly behind Unit 02. I then realized thatAsuka had gone strangely quiet. I suddenly felt like I was beingstrangled.  
只见00号部队从地上走了出来，手里拿着一把双叉长矛，占据了02号部队稍后的位置。然后我意识到明日香变得异常安静。我突然觉得自己被勒死了。

Rei readied the spear, and leaned back to put as much force into thethrow as possible.  
Rei准备好了长矛，并向后倾斜，以尽可能多地用力投掷。

Without warning, Unit 02 wrenched itself out of the beam of lightshining down from the Angel and ran straight to Unit 00, reaching forthe spear. I saw Unit 00 freeze up; there was no way for Rei to beexpecting anything like this. I think my heart stopped again. Was itAsuka, or was it...the Angel?  
毫无征兆地，02号部队从天使号上射下来的光束中挣脱出来，径直跑向00号部队，伸手去拿长矛。我看到 00 号机组冻结了;Rei 没有办法期待这样的事情。我想我的心又停止了跳动。是明日香，还是......天使？

My answer came when Unit 02 grabbed the spear from the prototype EVA'sunresisting hands, turned around, sighted for a few moments along thelight, and threw. The spear seemed to turn into a roaring flash ofenergy.  
当02号部队从原型EVA的防晒手上夺过长矛时，我的答案来了，转过身来，沿着光线瞄准了一会儿，然后扔了出去。长矛似乎变成了咆哮的能量闪光。

Bullseye.

I almost choked on my own breath.  
我差点被自己的呼吸呛到。

-

"Asuka..."

I carefully approached her, ducking underneath the yellow "Police Line- Do Not Cross" tape that surrounded the area.  
我小心翼翼地走近她，躲在环绕该区域的黄色“警察线-请勿越界”胶带下。

"I'm glad you're okay, Asuka."  
“我很高兴你没事，明日香。”

No answer. She was sitting on the ground, legs pulled up to her chest,arms wrapped around her shins, and chin resting on her knees. She wasrocking back and forth slightly.  
没有答案。她坐在地上，双腿拉到胸前，双臂缠绕在小腿上，下巴搁在膝盖上。她轻轻地来回摇晃。

"Asuka?"

No response. No sound, no indication that she realized I was there. Ifanything, she only rocked back and forth harder.  
没有回应。没有声音，没有迹象表明她意识到我在那里。如果有的话，她只会更用力地来回摇晃。

Despite being so...emotional earlier, during the battle, the oldinstincts took over, and I turned to walk away.  
尽管如此......情绪激动，在战斗中，老本能占据了上风，我转身走开了。

Then I heard her breathe in shakily. It wasn't your ordinary indrawnbreath, it was one with complex harmonics to it, ones that said, "thiswas almost a sob, you know;" little waveforms of sound that crept intoyour brain through your ears, following the neurons in, deeper anddeeper, until it went past the brain, past the mind, finding that thingwhich justified a person in calling him or herself "human" instead ofbeing merely another animal on this good green Earth, and yanked on it.  
然后我听到她颤抖地吸气。这不是你普通的呼吸，它是一种带有复杂谐波的声音，它说，“这几乎是啜泣，你知道的”，微小的声音波形通过你的耳朵潜入你的大脑，跟随神经元进入，越来越深，直到它穿过大脑，越过心灵，找到那个东西，证明一个人称自己为“人类”，而不仅仅是这个绿色地球上的另一种动物。 并猛拉它。

Hard.

I MUSTN'T RUN AWAY I MUSTN'T RUN AWAY I Mustn't Run Away I Mustn't RunAway I mustn't run away i mustn't run away-

I won't run away.

How remarkably inconvenient...  
多么不方便......

I walked back to her-she was still rocking back and forth-andstopped right at her side. Taking a breath and steeling myself for whatwould probably happen, I grabbed her by the upper left arm, managing tokeep a grip on the slick red plugsuit, and hauled her roughly to herfeet.  
我走回她身边——她仍然在来回摇晃——在她身边停了下来。我深吸一口气，为可能发生的事情做好准备，抓住她的左上臂，设法抓住光滑的红色外套，粗暴地将她拖到脚下。

I wanted to be gentle, but I don't think that would have accomplishedanything.  
我想变得温柔，但我认为这不会取得任何成就。

"Asuka!" Oh, God, her eyes...so completely empty. I faltered, for justa moment. Pulling myself together, I grabbed her by both shoulders andshook her. "Wake up! You have to _wake_up_!"  
“明日香！”哦，上帝，她的眼睛......所以完全空了。我踌躇了一下，只是一会儿。我振作起来，抓住她的双肩，摇晃着她。“醒醒！你必须_wake_up_！

Her blank face changed. I don't mean she just shifted expressions, Icould positively see something in her eyes _change_. The life withinreturned. But yes, her expression did shift, too. Again-surprise, thenembarrassment, then the hint of numbing sadness, then anger. I preparedmyself for a slap.  
她茫然的脸色变了。我不是说她只是改变了表情，我可以肯定地从她的眼睛里看到一些东西_变化_。内在的生命回来了。但是，是的，她的表情也发生了变化。再次是惊讶，然后是尴尬，然后是麻木的悲伤，然后是愤怒。我做好了挨一巴掌的准备。

It didn't come. The tears did, though.  
它没有来。不过，眼泪还是流了下来。

The sadness returned to her face, in full force. It hurt me just tolook at her face. The sum of years of repressed torment was there, inone moment, in one place. I almost started crying myself. No, I think Idid start crying. It was that terrible.  
悲伤又回到了她的脸上，全力以赴。光是看着她的脸，我就很痛。多年被压抑的折磨的总和，在某一刻，在一个地方。我自己几乎要哭了。不，我想我确实开始哭了。真是太可怕了。

"Oh, Shinji," she whispered. "Shinji, Shinji, I'm so sorry..."  
“哦，真嗣，”她低声说。“真嗣，真嗣，对不起......”

And suddenly I found my arms full of trembling, weeping female. Shewas repeating, "I'm so sorry," over and over.  
突然间，我发现我的手臂上充满了颤抖、哭泣的女性。她一遍又一遍地重复着“对不起”。

I attempted a soothing voice; though a bit shaky, I hoped it wouldwork. "It's all right, it's all right...I'm here, I won't go anywhere, Ipromise..." I felt her body going limp, and gently knelt down to theground. Her legs collapsed beneath her, and she leaned heavily on me.She still kept her arms in a firm hold around me, though, as if her lifedepended on it. "I'm here." I stroked her hair, holding her tight,letting her head rest against my shoulder. I could feel the tearssoaking through my shirt, but I didn't mind.  
我试着用舒缓的声音;虽然有点摇晃，但我希望它会起作用。“没事，没事......我在这里，我哪儿也不去，我保证......”我感觉到她的身体软绵绵的，轻轻地跪在地上。她的双腿瘫倒在她身下，她重重地靠在我身上。不过，她仍然紧紧地搂着我，仿佛她的生命取决于它。“我来了。”我抚摸着她的头发，紧紧地抱着她，让她的头靠在我的肩膀上。我能感觉到泪水浸透了我的衬衫，但我并不介意。

Her words were coming out in a torrent. "I saw I saw my mom I didn'twant to but it kept looking and I couldn't get away it was bad I wantedto die didn't want to be saved by her I wanted to die die but I..."  
她的话如洪流般涌出。“我看到了，我看到了我妈妈，我不想，但它一直在寻找，我无法逃脱，这很糟糕，我想死，不想被她救，我想死，死，但我......”

At any other time, perhaps this would have been too much for me tohandle. Funny, how strength seems to find you out of nowhere.  
在其他任何时候，也许这对我来说太过分了。有趣的是，力量似乎不知从何而来。

"...I saw you and I didn't want to die anymore oh Shinji I'm so sorryso sorry..."  
"...我看到你了，我不想再死了哦，真嗣，我很抱歉，对不起......”

Still, it did take me off guard.  
尽管如此，这确实让我措手不及。

I fumbled a bit for some words. "I'm here, Asuka. I won't leave youalone...I'll take care of you. I care about you." And it was true.  
我摸索了一下。“我在这里，明日香。我不会让你一个人呆着......我会照顾你的。我关心你。这是真的。

The words were like magic: her gasps grew smaller and smaller;eventually her breathing calmed. I think I heard her whisper, "Oh,Shinji," a few more times. I continued to hold her, feeling herheartbeat quietly thumping against my chest...or was it my own heart? Icouldn't tell, didn't care. She was all right.  
这些话就像变魔术一样：她的喘息声越来越小;最终，她的呼吸平静了下来。我想我又听到了她低声说“哦，真嗣”几次。我继续抱着她，感受着她的心跳悄悄地敲打着我的胸膛......还是我自己的心？我说不出来，不在乎。她没事。

I held an angel in my arms-a proper angel, not one of those cruelmonstrosities which assaulted us so regularly. My cheek rested againstthe top of her head, and I could smell the tears, the faint vapors ofLCL, a hint of the shampoo she used...I could smell her. That, to me,was just as real as the touch of her hair brushing across my face andthe smooth skin of her cheek that I lightly ran my finger across.  
我怀里抱着一个天使——一个妥妥的天使，不是那些经常袭击我们的残忍怪物之一。我的脸颊靠在她的头顶上，我能闻到眼泪的味道，LCL的淡淡蒸汽，她用过的洗发水的味道......我能闻到她的味道。对我来说，这就像她的头发拂过我的脸，以及我用手指轻轻划过她脸颊光滑的皮肤一样真实。

After a while, I realized that she had fallen asleep. Taking greatcare, I gingerly shifted her in my arms, hooked my left hand under herknees, and gently picked her up. She seemed amazingly light.  
过了一会儿，我意识到她已经睡着了。我小心翼翼地把她抱在怀里，左手勾在她的膝盖下，轻轻地把她抱起来。她看起来非常轻盈。

It wouldn't matter how much she weighed. I would have carried her outof Hell, demons at my heels, if I had to.  
她有多重并不重要。如果有必要的话，我会把她从地狱里抱出来，恶魔在我身后。

Her head rested against my shoulder, still, and I looked at hersleeping face. So innocent. So beautiful. So vulnerable.  
她的头靠在我的肩膀上，一动不动，我看着她熟睡的脸。太天真了。太美了。太脆弱了。

And not sad. The corners of her lips turned up just the slightest bit.  
而且不难过。她的嘴角微微上扬。

She was just a child. And so was I.  
她只是个孩子。我也是。

I mustn't run away...

No, not "mustn't". I _won't_ run away. Will not.  
不，不是“不能”。我_won t_逃跑。不会。

I will not run away, because I do not want to run away.  
我不会逃跑，因为我不想逃跑。

We were both children, but children do grow up.  
我们都是孩子，但孩子确实长大了。

Hang in there, Asuka. I'm taking you home.  
坚持下去，明日香。我带你回家。

I kissed her tenderly on the forehead and turned to go, ducking underthe yellow tape. It was no easy task, but I managed to do it withoutwaking her up, which was the important thing, and strode back towardsheadquarters. I could see Misato coming out of the nearest door.  
我温柔地吻了吻她的额头，转身走了，躲在黄色胶带下面。这不是一件容易的事，但我设法做到了，没有吵醒她，这是重要的事情，然后大步走回总部。我能看到美里从最近的门里出来。

I smiled at her, and at the world.  
我对她微笑，对世界微笑。

End.

Apologies to Terry Pratchett for the "complex harmonics" bit todescribe the almost-a-sob. It fit so nicely. And again, thanks to Elsa.The challenge really did make this whole idea come together. Here's thepiece that she wrote:  
向特里·普拉切特（Terry Pratchett）道歉，因为“复谐波”位描述了几乎是抽泣的。它非常合身。再一次，感谢 Elsa.The Challenge 确实让整个想法走到了一起。这是她写的文章：

It was probably the moonlight. Moonlight they say affects people in aweird way. Especially on a full moon. So that must be it.  
大概是月光。他们说月光以一种奇怪的方式影响着人们。尤其是在满月的时候。所以一定是这样。

She was whining again beside me as we walked back home. I turned totell her to shut up. Then I stopped. The light from the full moon playedon her hair as she also stopped to look at me and continued her nagging.I didn't listen to her, all I could think about was how beautiful shelooked in the moonlight. I moved towards her. She waved a hand before myeyes.  
当我们走回家时，她又在我身边呜。我转过身让她闭嘴。然后我停了下来。满月的光芒照在她的头发上，她也停下来看着我，继续唠叨。我没有听她说话，我所能想到的只是她在月光下的样子有多美。我朝她走去。她在我眼前挥了挥手。

"Hellooo? Anyone home?" she asked as I moved towards her. Then I putmy hands on her shoulders and pulled her closer.  
“你好？有人在家吗？“当我向她走去时，她问道。然后我把手放在她的肩膀上，把她拉得更近。

"Hey! What are you mmmpphhh!" she said as I kissed her on the mouth.  
“嘿！你是什么人，嗯，嗯！“她一边说，一边亲吻她的嘴。

It was exhausting to write this. Very muchly so. It was cathartic, ina manner, but not in the way of pouring my soul into this...more likereaching into my soul and tearing something out to put into words. MaybeI took out a little too much, 'cos I felt so emotionally drainedafterwards... But I'm glad I did it. I'm a soppy fool who liked writinga touching scene between Shinji and Asuka. Besides, I wasn't able tosleep the night before I wrote this, because of this. The idea justwouldn't leave me alone.  
写这个很累。非常如此。这是一种宣泄，但并不妨碍将我的灵魂倾注其中......更像是深入我的灵魂，撕下一些东西来表达。也许我拿出的有点太多了，因为之后我感到情绪低落......但我很高兴我做到了。我是一个傻瓜，喜欢写真嗣和明日香之间的感人场景。此外，由于这个原因，我在写这篇文章的前一天晚上无法入睡。这个想法不会让我一个人呆着。

And yes, I can sleep now.  
是的，我现在可以睡觉了。
