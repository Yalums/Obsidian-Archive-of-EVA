It was on a warm, sunny afternoon during school lunch that two girls; one red haired, the other blue, got together and schemed. Schemed in the way that only 14 year old girls can. In quiet, conspiratorial tones with eyes and ears on constant watch for anyone who might stray too close to their secretive conversation.  
在一个温暖阳光的午后，学校午餐时分，两位少女——一位红发，另一位蓝发——聚在一起密谋。她们以 14 岁少女独有的方式密谋，用低沉而共谋的语调交谈，眼睛和耳朵时刻警惕着任何可能靠近他们秘密对话的人。

The scowl on Asuka's face was reason enough for others to give the two some space. The threat of a verbal tirade ensured much needed privacy. Even Hikari Horaki, the class rep had sensed the tension around the unlikely pair and wisely found other duties to attend to.  
明日香脸上的怒容足以让旁人给这对组合留出空间。一场口头的猛烈抨击确保了他们所需的隐私。就连班长洞木光也察觉到了这对不寻常搭档周围的紧张气氛，明智地找到了其他事务去处理。

For Asuka, it was of little comfort. This was a delicate matter and one she would kill to remain private. Even worse, she wasn't at all happy to be taking advice from the _wondergirl_ herself but Rei seemed more than pleased to give it out. After all, and much to Asuka's chagrin, Rei _did_ have more experience in this particular matter.  
对明日香来说，这并无多少安慰。这是一件微妙的事情，她宁愿为此拼命也要保持私密。更糟糕的是，她并不乐意从绫波丽那里接受建议，但丽似乎非常乐意提供。毕竟，让明日香懊恼的是，丽在这件事上的确更有经验。

That being crashing into Shinji and _"flashing him her panties."_  
那就是撞上真嗣并“让他看到她的内裤”。

"_No!_ That's now what this is about, dammit!" She hissed, eyes darting in a panic to see if anyone had heard Rei's words. She had been listening to Rei outlining the 'plan' she had come up with. Her patience was wearing thin however.  
“不！该死的，不是这样的！”她低声咆哮，慌乱地四处张望，看是否有人听到了丽的话。她一直在听丽阐述她想出的‘计划’。然而，她的耐心正逐渐耗尽。

She hated it. Hated Rei and having to rely on her for 'help'. Hated that _idiot,_ hated this... _feeling_.  
她讨厌这样。讨厌丽，讨厌不得不依靠她来‘帮忙’。讨厌那个白痴，讨厌这种...感觉。

Maybe this was a mistake?  
也许这是个错误？

This was _silly_. Why did she care about Shinji and what he was up to and which girls he collided with? They were just friends after all. Just friends, who've been together since childhood. Just friends who knew pretty much everything about each other.  
这真是愚蠢。她为何要在意真嗣以及他在忙些什么，又和哪些女孩纠缠不清？毕竟，他们只是朋友。只是自幼相伴的朋友。只是彼此间几乎无所不知的朋友。

_Just_ friends. 只是朋友。

She looked at Rei and saw those eyes twinkling with mirth and the knowledge that _she_ had something Asuka didn't. It was enough to strengthen her resolve and she cursed herself for her momentary lapse in courage. That the 'something_'_ in question involved bodily entanglement with her childhood friend didn't seem strange at all.  
她看着绫波，注意到那双眼中闪烁着欢愉与她所不知的秘密。这足以坚定她的决心，并暗自咒骂自己片刻的勇气缺失。至于那‘秘密’涉及与她青梅竹马的亲密接触，她竟丝毫不觉奇怪。

She growled at Rei's insinuations.  
她对丽影射的话咆哮着。

"I am _not_ like you. There will be no panties involved!" she felt dirty at having to clarify something so obvious. Feeling her face warming, she looked away and took an angry bite from her bento. If Rei noticed her rosy cheeks, she didn't say.  
“我和你不一样。不会有内裤这种事！”她觉得自己不得不澄清这么明显的事情，感到很脏。感觉到脸颊发热，她转过头去，愤怒地咬了一口便当。如果丽注意到她红润的脸颊，她没有说。

She just giggled. 她只是咯咯地笑。

Rei seemed to do that a lot. A trait Asuka found _supremely_ irritating.  
丽似乎经常这样做。这让明日香觉得极其恼火。

"Oh, so you'd rather go _without_ the panties?" she replied casually, tone a mixture of awe and disgust.  
“哦，所以你宁愿不穿内裤？”她随意地回答，语气中混杂着惊讶与厌恶。

Asuka nearly choked on her food. Sputtering as she snatched at her soda, she took a long drink as she glared. Rei simply raised her hand to cover a smile, the very picture of innocence. _Innocent? Hardly!_ Asuka thought darkly, recalling her and Shinji's first encounter with the girl.  
明日香差点被食物呛到。她一边抢过汽水猛灌，一边瞪着丽，而丽只是抬起手遮住微笑，一副无辜的样子。无辜？才怪！明日香暗自想着，回忆起她和真嗣第一次遇见这女孩的情景。

_Mein gott, she's a pervert!  
我的天，她是个变态！_

Failing to vaporize Rei by looks alone, she turned her attention across the school yard to the subject of their discussion.  
仅仅通过外表无法蒸发丽，她将注意力转向了操场上他们讨论的对象。

Shinji. 真嗣。

He was goofing off with his stooge friends again, smiling at some joke or other. Smiling and carefree. Wearing his usual white shirt and dark trousers, Shinji was to anyone else, just another schoolboy.  
他又在和他的跟班朋友们嬉闹，对着某个笑话或别的什么笑得无忧无虑。穿着他那件惯常的白衬衫和深色裤子，对其他人来说，真嗣不过是又一个普通学生。

Not to her though and her thoughts turned to her relationship with him. Something that had become a common occurrence recently.  
但对她而言并非如此，她的思绪转向了与他的关系。最近这种情况变得愈发频繁。

She had during the quietest, darkest moments of privacy admitted her own growing feelings for him. The realisation did nothing but increase that dull ache she felt when they were together. For her, things had changed.  
在那些最宁静、最私密的时刻，她曾坦白了自己对他日益增长的情感。这一认识非但没有缓解，反而加剧了他们在一起时她感受到的那股隐隐的痛楚。对她而言，一切都变了。

_He_ carried on as normal, oblivious. As if they were still the children they had been when they first met. She sighed, wondering at how it had seemingly crept up on her.  
他依旧如常，浑然不觉。仿佛他们还是初遇时的那两个孩子。她叹了口气，疑惑这一切是如何悄然降临在她身上的。

W_hen did things become so difficult?_  
事情何时变得如此艰难？

Didn't Shinji notice anything different? How she would catch herself staring at him? That more often than not, words simply got stuck in her throat whenever he gave the briefest of smiles in her direction? That she went out of her way to spend more time with him? Those ever so brief moments when she would find an excuse to fix his collar, or run a comb through his untidy hair in the mornings.  
难道真嗣一点都没察觉到有什么不同吗？她发现自己盯着他的那些时刻？每当他向她投来最短暂的微笑时，她常常话到嘴边却说不出口？她特意花更多时间和他在一起？那些她找借口整理他衣领，或是在早晨用梳子梳理他凌乱头发的短暂瞬间。

_No reaction at all._ There were times when she thought she caught something, some inkling of feelings reciprocated. But those times were fleeting.  
完全没有反应。有时候她以为自己捕捉到了什么，感受到了某种情感的回应。但那些时刻转瞬即逝。

Maybe he didn't care? Maybe he didn't feel the same? Asuka fought down the sickly feeling at the thought.  
也许他并不在意？也许他的感觉并不一样？想到这里，明日香压下了那种令人作呕的感觉。

Or was he just clueless? He was a boy after all.  
还是说他只是个愣头青？毕竟他只是个男孩。

Asuka suspected as much but fear of any other answer had driven her to action. _If he isn't going to do anything, then dammit I will. This is unacceptable!_ She recalled thinking to herself.  
明日香早有此疑虑，但害怕其他答案的恐惧驱使她采取了行动。如果他不打算做任何事，那么该死的，我会去做。这绝对不能接受！她回想起自己当时的想法。

_Stupid Shinji. 笨蛋真嗣。_

The thought driven not by malice but by that now familiar mix of frustration and longing. Asuka idly wondered what she would do to make the boy pay for the turmoil she was going through. Before her thoughts turned to the various implements of pain and death she would use, she was brought back to reality by a quiet cough.  
这个念头并非出于恶意，而是源于那股如今已熟悉的挫败与渴望交织的情感。明日香漫不经心地思索着，要让那男孩为给她带来的纷扰付出怎样的代价。在她脑海中浮现出各种施虐与致死的工具之前，一声轻咳将她拉回了现实。

She turned to Rei and saw the raised eyebrow and unspoken question in her eyes – _'Do you want to do this?'_  
她转向丽，看到了她扬起的眉毛和眼中未说出口的疑问——‘你想这么做吗？’

Asuka had questioned the girl on her motives and Rei replied, with all sincerity, that she simply wanted to help her. Asuka had her doubts. From the very first day Rei had been a thorn in her side. _This_ would be nothing more than a temporary truce. She recalled their 'conversation' last week, another school yard argument about something trivial when Rei had once again attacked the one vulnerability in Asuka's defence.  
明日香曾质疑那女孩的动机，丽真诚地回答说她只是想帮助她。明日香对此持怀疑态度。从第一天起，丽就成了她身边的刺。这不过是一场暂时的休战。她回想起上周他们的‘对话’，又一次关于琐事的校园争吵，丽再次攻击了明日香防御中的唯一弱点。

Her relationship with Shinji.  
她与真嗣的关系。

_"Maybe you want to get up close and personal with him too?__"_ Rei had meant it as a joke, a sly grin adding to the effect.  
“也许你也想和他亲密接触一下？”丽本意是开玩笑，狡黠的笑容更增添了效果。

Without thinking Asuka had agreed, catching herself a second too late. Both hands shooting to cover her mouth as her brain finally caught up to stop any further secrets spilling forth. The damage had been done however, evident by Rei's own look of astonishment. Asuka still couldn't believe it. She had admitted _that_ to Rei of all people. Now here she was and her thoughts turned back to her goal.  
未经思考，明日香就同意了，但为时已晚。双手迅速捂住嘴巴，大脑终于跟上节奏，阻止了更多秘密的泄露。然而，伤害已经造成，丽惊讶的表情显而易见。明日香仍然无法相信。她居然对丽承认了这一点。现在她站在这里，思绪又回到了她的目标上。

_I want Shinji to see me. To really see me.  
“我想让真嗣看到我。真正地看到我。”_

Would he? 他会吗？

No amount of false bravado or lying to herself would guarantee an answer. Their was only one way to find out and she growled out a response.  
无论多少虚假的勇敢或自欺欺人，都无法保证答案。只有一种方法可以得知，她咆哮着回应。

"_Fine,_ tomorrow morning, like we agreed."  
“好吧，明早，就像我们约定的那样。”

"Do you want to go over your lines again?" It was whispered but Rei didn't even try to hide the amusement in her voice. Asuka flushed as she recalled Rei's advice on how to get Shinji to _"take a hint" w_ith scripted dialogue taken straight out of a cheesy romcom to other more _adult_ suggestions.  
“你想再过一遍台词吗？” 声音虽轻，但丽并未掩饰语气中的戏谑。明日香想起丽关于如何让真嗣“领会暗示”的建议，从直接取自俗套爱情喜剧的剧本对话，到更为成熟的提议，不禁脸颊泛红。

Subtle, she was not. 她并不含蓄。

"No! I don't need _that_ kind of help! You just be there." Relief flooded her as Rei dropped the subject without further protest.  
"不！我不需要那种帮助！你只要在那儿就好。" 当丽没有进一步抗议就放下这个话题时，她感到一阵解脱涌上心头。

"Okay, guess I'll see you later," she said. And with a picturesque angelic smile, the girl turned around and walked away, a spring in her step that made Asuka feel like she had just sold her soul.  
"好吧，那我们晚点见，" 她说道。带着一幅天使般的微笑，女孩转身离开，步伐轻盈得让明日香感觉自己刚刚出卖了灵魂。

The sickly feeling returned.  
那种恶心的感觉又回来了。

---

**The next morning: 次日清晨：**

_This should be fun,_ Rei thought.  
这应该会很有趣，丽心想。

They waited for Shinji, just to the side of the road and Rei took the momentary peace and quiet to reflect on just _how_ she had gotten to this point.  
他们在路边等待真嗣，丽趁这片刻的宁静，反思自己是如何走到这一步的。

It was no secret that she and Asuka didn't get along. From the very first day, she knew her accidental tumble with the boy brought out Asuka's jealous side. It was a point she regularly employed in the never ending war of words between the two_._  
她和明日香相处不来早已不是秘密。从第一天起，她就意识到自己与那个男孩的意外跌倒激起了明日香的嫉妒心。这一点在两人无休止的口舌之争中，她经常加以利用。

_"Maybe you want to get up close and personal with him too?"_ she had teased, daring Asuka to crash into Shinji's arms just as she had. She didn't think Asuka of all people would take such an off-hand comment so seriously.  
“也许你也想和他亲密接触一下？”她曾打趣道，挑衅明日香像她那样扑进真嗣的怀里。她没想到，明日香居然会把这句随口一说的话当真。

Asuka's reply that she _did_ want exactly that had shocked her. Not expecting such an answer, she had allowed herself to be dragged away to a secluded area and sworn to secrecy under Asuka's desperate glare.  
明日香那句她确实想要这样的回答让她震惊了。没想到会得到这样的答案，她便任由自己被拖到一个隐蔽的地方，在明日香急切的目光下发誓保密。

Asuka didn't _exactly_ ask for help, that's not something Asuka would do.  
明日香并没有明确求助，这不是她会做的事。

But Rei knew a girl in need of support when she saw one. However, now that the full implications of her involvement made themselves known, she felt a stab of doubt. Why had she agreed to tag along? Since when was it _her_ responsibility to play match maker for these two?  
但丽知道，当她看到一个需要支持的女孩时，她会明白。然而，现在她完全意识到自己卷入其中的全部含义，心中不禁涌起一丝疑虑。她为何会同意跟随？从何时起，撮合这两个人成了她的责任？

_Because they're both idiots.  
因为他们俩都是傻瓜。_

Rumours circling the pair were not anything anything new and it was a popular topic of hushed conversations in class 2-A. Their long lasting and close friendship fuelling much talk around the 'w_ill they? won't they?_' phase they were going through.  
关于这对搭档的流言并非新鲜事，而是二年级 A 班里窃窃私语的热门话题。他们长久而亲密的友谊引发了大量关于他们是否会有进一步发展的猜测。

Only Rei knew how close to the truth it all was. So she would help, with some reluctance. She sighed as she stared at Asuka who stood beside her.  
只有丽知道这一切有多接近真相。因此，尽管有些不情愿，她还是会帮忙。她叹了口气，盯着站在她身边的明日香。

_Too late now to back out now.  
现在想退出已经太迟了。_

She was doing her best to remain inconspicuous as they waited. Just a pair of schoolgirls, school bags in hand, waiting for their friends would be their answer should anyone ask.  
她尽力保持不引人注意，他们等待时，如果有人问起，她们会回答只是在等朋友的一对女学生，手里还拿着书包。

Asuka was making a poor show of it however.  
然而，明日香的表现却很糟糕。

She was pressed right up against the corner of a wall and doing her best impression of an owl. Head turning back and forth down the street where Shinji should be approaching from _any_ moment now. Rei smiled at the sight of the girl, normally so self-assured, almost trembling with nervousness.  
她紧贴着墙角，尽力模仿着猫头鹰的样子。头来回转动，沿着街道望去，真嗣应该随时会从那里出现。看到平时自信满满的女孩此刻几乎紧张得发抖，绫波露出了微笑。

Or was it anticipation? 还是说，这是期待呢？

"Is he here yet?" “他来了吗？”

A perfectly innocent question. Rei piqued her voice _just right,_ hoping she didn't give away just how amusing it all was. After all, if she had to stand here, she might as well enjoy it.  
一个完全无辜的问题。丽恰到好处地提高了声音，希望没有透露出这一切有多么有趣。毕竟，如果她不得不站在这里，不妨好好享受一下。

"_No!_ I told you, he's late! Where is that _idiot?_"  
“不！我告诉过你，他迟到了！那个白痴在哪里？”

Asuka didn't spare her a glance, her attention solely on the street ahead. In her hands she was grasping her bag, knuckles almost white. Rei took the opportunity to look over her partner once more. She was wearing the usual uniform of their school, dressed no differently than any other day. Hair the same as usual, she noted, trying and failing to fight off a brief twinge of jealousy. She marvelled at how lustrous it always seemed to look no matter the weather or occasion.  
明日香没有看她一眼，她的注意力完全集中在面前的街道上。她手里紧握着书包，指节几乎发白。丽趁机再次打量了一下她的搭档。她穿着他们学校的制服，和平常没什么两样。头发也一如既往，她注意到，试图抑制却未能成功地压下那一丝嫉妒。她惊叹于无论天气或场合如何，那头发总是显得那么有光泽。

She shook the thoughts away as something gnawed at her during her appraisal. Something was _missing_. Something important. Rei racked her brain trying to figure it out and then-  
她摇摇头，试图驱散那些在她评估时啃噬心头的思绪。有些东西不见了。很重要的东西。丽绞尽脑汁想要弄明白，然后——

"He's here!" Asuka turned to her, eyes wide and voice rising with quiet panic.  
“他来了！”明日香转向她，眼睛睁得大大的，声音因隐秘的恐慌而升高。

"Good luck!" she gave a thumbs up and stepped back, further out of sight. Asuka nodded in reply, lips pressed together in determination.  
“祝你好运！”她竖起大拇指，向后退了几步，更加隐蔽。明日香点头回应，紧抿双唇，神情坚定。

_Lips... her mouth? That's it!  
嘴唇...她的嘴？就是这样！_

Frantic, Rei opened her own school bag and with no time to waste, removed the item she had brought just for the occasion.  
慌乱中，丽打开自己的书包，毫不犹豫地取出了她为这次场合特意准备的物品。

"Asuka!" she hissed. “明日香！”她低声喊道。

Asuka turned to her, irritated.  
明日香转向她，显得有些恼火。

"What _now?_ He's almost h-hmmmpph!"  
“又怎么了？他都快——嗯唔！”

And found herself cut off as a piece of toast was shoved into her mouth.  
结果话还没说完，一片吐司就被塞进了她的嘴里。

No time to enjoy the satisfaction of shutting the other girl up, Rei quickly shushed the muffled protests with pointed fingers at the corner, hoping Asuka would get the message. Asuka's eyes flashed but settled for waving Rei out of sight, apparently saving thoughts of revenge for later.  
还没来得及享受让另一个女孩闭嘴的满足感，丽迅速用手指向角落，试图用这种方式平息那些闷闷的抗议声，希望明日香能领会她的意思。明日香的眼神一闪而过，但还是选择挥手让丽离开视线，显然是把复仇的念头留待以后。

This was it. 就是这样。

The plan was foolproof. 这个计划天衣无缝。

They would wait for Shinji to approach. Asuka would leap forward into Shinji in a completely _accidental_ collision. She would, in true Asuka fashion, accuse him of clumsiness and impropriety. He would, as Shinji was wont to do, apologise. Asuka would mention their close proximity and so the cycle of flirtatious teasing and red faced embarrassment would begin. They would let their guard down, maybe even a few honest words here and there.  
他们会等待真嗣靠近。明日香会故意向前一跃，与真嗣发生一场完全意外的碰撞。她会以典型的明日香风格，指责他的笨拙和不妥。而他，像真嗣常做的那样，会道歉。明日香会提及他们之间的亲密距离，于是调情般的揶揄和脸红的尴尬便开始了。他们会放松警惕，也许还会偶尔说出几句真心话。

And the rest would simply fall into place.  
而剩下的，自然会水到渠成。

_Surely_ Shinji would realise that Asuka wanted to get closer to him? That they could have something _more_?  
真嗣肯定能意识到明日香想与他更亲近吧？他们之间能拥有更多吗？

He wouldn't be able to resist, Rei was sure of it. He was a boy after all.  
他肯定抵抗不了，丽对此深信不疑。他毕竟只是个男孩。

The tension was palpable, time seeming to slow as she waited. And waited some more. Asuka had yet to move.  
紧张感显而易见，时间仿佛放慢了脚步，她等待着，继续等待。明日香仍未有所动作。

Asuka was all of a sudden, very still.  
明日香突然间，变得异常静止。

Rei frowned as she was struck with sudden clairity. _No! She's having second thoughts? Now?!_  
丽皱起眉头，突然间清晰地意识到。不！她现在有疑虑了？现在？！

This not being part of the plan, her thoughts went into overdrive to figure out a way to salvage the potential disaster and get the statuesque girl moving.  
这不在计划之内，她的思绪飞速运转，试图找到挽救这场潜在灾难的方法，让那位高挑的女孩继续行动。

_I gave up my toast for this!  
我连吐司都放弃了，就为了这个！_

She peeked around the corner and spied Shinji running towards them, oblivious to the events about to unfold.  
她探头望向拐角处，看到真嗣正朝他们跑来，对即将发生的事情浑然不觉。

A quick glance back at Asuka, Rei saw her eyes were glazed over. Here in body but mind somewhere far over over the rainbow. She made her decision.  
回头匆匆一瞥明日香，绫波注意到她的眼神已变得空洞。身体在此，心却不知飘向了彩虹的另一端。她做出了决定。

Readying herself, Rei took a deep breath_._  
绫波做好准备，深吸了一口气。

"The things I do for love..." she whispered.  
“我为爱所做的一切……”她低语道。

And gave Asuka a small push.  
并轻轻推了明日香一下。

A surprised shriek escaped from the redhead as she was suddenly propelled forward into the path of the boy. Shinji's own shout of surprise was cut off by the dull sound of bodies, school bags and dignity colliding in the street.  
随着她突然被推向前，红发少女发出了一声惊呼。真嗣的惊叫声则被街道上身体、书包和尊严碰撞的沉闷声响所打断。

Rei waited a moment as silence reigned.  
丽等待了一会儿，寂静笼罩着四周。

It was quiet. 四周一片寂静。

_Why isn't Asuka saying anything?_ she thought to herself and dared a quick look around the corner once more to see the results.  
为什么明日香一句话也不说？她暗自思忖，再次鼓起勇气迅速瞥了一眼拐角处，想看看情况如何。

_Oh.  
_  
There was Shinji, lying on his back, a hand coming to hold his head in obvious pain and Asuka...  
那里躺着真嗣，仰面朝天，一只手痛苦地扶着头，而明日香...

Asuka who lay sprawled across the boy's lap in a very unladylike fashion, arms and legs askew. She was not moving. Her sudden contact with Shinji must have knocked her out completely.  
明日香以一种非常不淑女的姿势横躺在男孩的腿上，四肢散乱。她一动不动。她与真嗣的突然接触肯定让她完全昏了过去。

Rei could only sigh. 丽只能叹息。

_Honestly! All that planning yesterday for... this?! Hopeless._ she thought, shaking her head.  
说实话！昨天费了那么多心思就为了...这个？！真是没救了。她摇着头想。

Deciding it would be best to leave before Asuka came to, she turned towards the direction of the school. Securing her satchel over her shoulder as she walked away, she went over the events that had led to this moment and couldn't help but smile.  
决定在明日香醒来之前离开是最好的选择，她转身朝学校的方向走去。一边走一边将书包挎在肩上，回想起导致这一刻发生的种种事件，她忍不住笑了。

_So she did wear panties after all.  
原来她真的穿了内裤。_

She giggled and then breaking into a run, clamped a hand over her mouth at the laugh threatening to escape. Despite everything, she remained hopeful.  
她咯咯笑着，随即跑了起来，一手捂住嘴以防笑声泄露。尽管面临种种困境，她依然保持着希望。

_Good luck you two. 祝你们好运。_

---

With the sound of laughter fading somewhere in the background, Shinji slowly tried to sit up, painfully aware of the throbbing feeling in his head.  
笑声在背景中渐渐远去，真嗣缓缓试图坐起身，头部阵阵抽痛让他痛苦不已。

"Oww," he mumbled to himself, wincing as he carefully reached up to survey the damage. Any thoughts of pain were pushed to the back of his mind however as he suddenly became aware of the weight on top of him and his eyes shot straight open.  
“哎哟，”他喃喃自语，小心翼翼地伸手去检查伤势，眉头紧皱。然而，当意识到自己身上压着什么东西时，疼痛的念头被抛诸脑后，他的眼睛猛地睁开。

A strangled yelp escaped him as he took in the sight of what was undoubtedly a girl draped over him, motionless. He recognised the uniform of their school, eyes drinking in the sight of white socks over slender legs with the skirt rising tantalisingly over her-  
他惊慌失措地发出一声窒息般的叫声，眼前无疑是一个女孩，一动不动地趴在他身上。他认出了她身上的校服，目光顺着纤细的双腿上白色的袜子，再到那撩人的裙摆——

_No!_ Shinji mentally slapped himself and hurriedly dragged his eyes away to see who this person was. Messy red hair hid the girl's face from view.  
不！真嗣在心里给了自己一巴掌，急忙移开视线，想看看这个人是谁。凌乱的红发遮住了女孩的脸。

_Wait... red?_ Only one name came to mind.  
等等...红色？只有一个名字浮现在脑海中。

_"_Asuka?" he asked, tentatively.  
“明日香？”他试探性地问道。

He waited for a response and when she didn't move, concern grew to worry, springing him to action. _Very_ aware as to where he was placing his hands, he carefully shifted her weight just enough for him to get out from under her.  
他等待着她的回应，见她毫无动静，关切逐渐转为忧虑，促使他迅速采取行动。他非常清楚自己的双手放在何处，小心翼翼地调整她的重心，刚好够自己从她身下脱身。

Now free, he scuttled over to get a better view of her face.  
现在自由了，他急忙凑过去，想更清楚地看看她的脸。

As an afterthought, a gentlemanly hand shot out and tugged down the skirt over her thighs. Shinji tried very hard not to spend too much thought on this, making a solemn vow never to tell Asuka she had almost flashed half the street.  
突然间，一只绅士的手伸了出来，将她大腿上的裙子拉下。真嗣努力不去过多思考这一幕，暗自发誓绝不会告诉明日香她差点让半个街道的人都看到了她的走光。

A quick glance around him confirmed they were alone.  
他迅速环顾四周，确认周围空无一人。

_One less thing to worry about.  
少了一件需要担心的事。_
