Hello fanfiction people! I live! epic sorry about my other story what makes you most happy. It is still being written but I've been distracted with work and Dangan Ronpa and life in general. The other story I've reached the point i realized I could take that story any direction I want so I'm deciding what to do with it. In the meanwhile I hope you enjoy this Halloween based story that I cooked up last year but didn't finish in time. There are timeskips so heads up. One of my friends said they proof read it but i think they got tired. Also in the development phase is Asuka in Wonderland but I won't work on that until What makes you happy is almost done. Anyway Enjoy the story. (BTW Shinji's costume is inspired by the music of the night. An excellent Asuka/Shinji fanfiction that i wished was finished.)  
大家好，同人小说爱好者们！我还活跃着呢！对于我的另一部作品《什么让你最快乐》，我深感抱歉。它还在创作中，只是我被工作、《弹丸论破》以及日常琐事分散了注意力。至于另一部作品，我已经到了可以自由发挥的阶段，正在考虑接下来的走向。与此同时，希望你们能喜欢我去年构思但未能及时完成的这个万圣节故事。故事中会有时间跳跃，请留意。我的一个朋友帮忙校对过，但可能中途感到疲倦了。此外，《明日香在仙境》也在筹备中，不过我会等到《什么让你快乐》接近完成时再着手。总之，希望大家喜欢这个故事。（顺便说一下，真嗣的服装灵感源自《夜之乐章》。） 一篇精彩的明日香与真嗣同人文，我多么希望它已经完结。)

T'was the night of Hallow's eve and all through the house, not a creature was...wait wrong story.  
那是万圣节之夜，屋内万籁俱寂，连一只小动物的动静都没有……哎呀，讲错了故事。

Shinji Ikari, master pilot of EVA unit 01 and slayer of angels, was making dinner though he himself would not be eating it until much later. Still, Shinji was enjoying the peaceful calm and tranquility of cooking in a silent yet warm house. "Misato! I am going to kill you!" Shinji sighed, well it was fun while it lasted. Shinji tried focusing on the family dinner he was cooking but it was hard to drown out the various "I never signed up for this!" and "I'm wearing that!?" As the young man finished dinner, carefully looked over to make sure that everything that needed to be cooked for the meal was cooked or else Misato would try to finish the job again and burn down the apartment while they were gone. Shinji hadn't actually expect his guardian to make good on the threat issued earlier in the month but then again Misato was a cunning and crafty strategist, so pulling off the unexpected was in her bag of tricks. Too bad that the targets this time were the children she took care of.  
碇真嗣，EVA 初号机的杰出驾驶员，天使的终结者，正在准备晚餐，尽管他自己要等到很晚才能吃。即便如此，真嗣依然沉浸在宁静而温暖的家中烹饪的平和氛围中。“美里！你等着瞧！”真嗣叹息道，短暂的宁静就此结束。他努力专注于正在烹饪的家庭晚餐，但那些“我可没答应过这个！”和“我得穿那个？！”的念头不断干扰。晚餐完成后，真嗣仔细检查确保所有食物都已煮熟，以免美里再次尝试接手，结果在他们外出时把公寓给烧了。 真嗣原本并未料到他的监护人美里会真的实施月初的威胁，毕竟她是个狡猾且策略高明的战略家，擅长出其不意。遗憾的是，这次她针对的是她所照顾的孩子们。

_3 weeks ago_

_"You want us to what!?" Asuka shrieked at banshee level volume. Shinji briefly wondered exactly how many noise complaints had been issued against the apartment. Shinji wisely decided it would be safer if he just continued eating dinner_ _than ask__. Misato gave Asuka a wide grin, fueling the red haired girl's disbelief. Shinji noticed the red tinge on Misato's cheeks and realized that apparently drinking 6 cans of beer in a row made you immune to ear shattering declarations._  
"你想让我们干什么！？" 明日香尖叫着，声音大得像女妖一样。真嗣不禁好奇，这公寓到底收到了多少噪音投诉。他明智地选择继续吃饭，而不是去问。美里对明日香露出了一个灿烂的笑容，让红发女孩更加难以置信。真嗣注意到美里脸颊上的红晕，意识到一口气喝下六罐啤酒似乎能让人对刺耳的尖叫免疫。

_"__I want the two of you to go Trick or Treating this year" Misato said with a slight slur and hiccup. Asuka was ferocious...well more so than usual. "I am 14 Misato, not a child!" The drunken guardian simply smiled at Asuka as if she were a puppy absentmindedly chasing its own tail. "You are tricking or treating. If you do not or will not buy a costume, one will be provided for you and you will not like it" "What is this a courtroom? I w__e__nt to college for god sake! Why don't you go with baka Shinji?_ _You might need to.__h__e's so wimpy you might have to hold his hand house to house_ _just to stop him from being scared__!"_  
今年我想让你俩去玩'不给糖就捣蛋'，" 美里带着醉意和打嗝说道。明日香异常愤怒...比平时更甚。"我 14 岁了，美里，已经不是小孩子了！" 这位醉酒的监护人只是对明日香微笑，仿佛她是一只无意识追逐自己尾巴的小狗。"你们就是要去玩'不给糖就捣蛋'。如果你们不买或不愿买服装，我会给你们准备一套，你们不会喜欢的。" "这是法庭吗？我可是上过大学的！你怎么不和笨蛋真嗣一起去？你可能需要这么做。他那么胆小，你可能得从一户到另一户都牵着他的手，就为了不让他害怕！

_Shinji let out a sigh. Once more he was dragged back into the lion's pit. For someone Asuka constantly berated and put down, she seemed the need to drag him back in discussions if he stayed too quiet. It was almost if she wanted his attention._ _Suddenly Asuka's face twisted in disgust "Eww nevermind. If you went with Shinji, you'd probably dress up as a cheap slut and he'd be groping you all night"_ _**"Ugh, no way she wants my attention. She just likes torturing me"**_ _Shinji thought. "AND YOU!"  
真嗣叹了口气。又一次，他被拖回了狮子的巢穴。对于一个经常被明日香责骂和贬低的人来说，如果他过于沉默，她似乎总是要把他拉回到讨论中。这几乎就像她想要他的注意。突然，明日香的脸因厌恶而扭曲，“呃，算了。如果你和真嗣在一起，你可能会打扮成一个廉价的荡妇，而他整晚都会对你动手动脚。”“呃，她绝对不是想要我的注意。她只是喜欢折磨我。”真嗣想。“还有你！”  
_

_Shinji's eyes widened as he found himself staring at Asuka pointing a sharp knife accusingly in his direction. Why did he have to cook whole fish today of all days?_ _**"Though"**_ _he told himself as he stared into Asuka's sky blue eyes_ _**"It is nice to make eye contact with her. She has such a lovely shade of blu..."**_ _"__Oi! Baka Shinji" Shinji barely had enough time to get out "Whahuh?" before he felt Asuka's knuckles not so gently tapped against his forehead. "__Are you going to answer me? Pay attention! The table's for eating, not fantasizing about Misato in you__r_ _perverted hentai day dreams""I wasn't..." "Anyway" Asuka pressed on without waiting for_ _him to defend himself_ _"__Are you honestly going to humor this old hag and go treat or tricking?"_  
真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，因为他发现自己正面对着明日香，她手持一把尖刀，正怒气冲冲地指向他。为什么非得在今天做全鱼呢？“不过，”他凝视着明日香那蔚蓝的眼睛，心想，“能这样看着她真好。她的眼睛颜色真美……”“喂！笨蛋真嗣！”真嗣刚要开口，就被明日香不轻不重地敲了下额头。“你倒是回答我啊！专心点！桌子是用来吃饭的，不是让你幻想美里在那些下流的漫画里。”“我没……”“算了，”明日香不等他辩解就接着说，“你真的要听那个老太婆的话，去玩‘不给糖就捣蛋’吗？”

_Shinji looked at Misato, who swayed uneasily and seemed almost entranced by everything_ _happening before her__. What had been half a dozen beers stacked on the counter had now magically became 18 cans. How long had Shijini been thinking? Anyway there was no way Misato was going to remember this idea. Still "I don't know Asuka. It could be fun" he answered meekly, hoping the red twister would go easy on him. "What? What's fun about acting like stupid snot nose kids!?" it didn't work "I said it could be!" "You just want to see what slutty costumes our female classmates are going to wear huh? You pervert" "Hey that's not true!" "What's wrong, can't keep it in your pants?" "ASUKA!"  
真嗣望着摇摆不定的美里，她似乎被眼前的一切深深吸引。原本柜台上只有半打啤酒，现在却神奇地变成了 18 罐。真嗣究竟思考了多久？无论如何，美里肯定记不住这个点子。他怯怯地回应：“我不清楚，明日香。或许挺有意思的。”他希望这位红发少女能对他宽容些。“什么？装成幼稚的小孩有什么乐趣！”这招没起作用，“我说了可能有趣！”“你就是想看看我们女同学会穿什么暴露的服装吧？你这个变态。”“嘿，不是那样的！”“怎么了，控制不住自己了吗？”“明日香！”  
_

_Misato chuckled silently as her young wards shouting match quickly escalated. Behind her drunken facade, sober thoughts swirled in her mind._ _**"I want you two to be normal...just for a night."**_ _she_ _justified_ _to them without saying a word_ _**"Just pretend to be two kids with not a worry in the world. You two are my family and I love you both"**_  
美里暗笑，目睹她所照顾的年轻人争吵愈演愈烈。尽管外表醉酒，内心却清醒地思索着。“今晚，我希望你们能像普通人一样。”她心中默念，未曾出声，“就当是两个毫无烦恼的孩子吧。你们是我的家人，我深爱着你们。”

_Misato gave a small smile as both children stood out of their chairs, Asuka's face just inches away from Shinji's. Shinji surprised Asuka by showing that rare ounce of courage and refusing to back down from the raging red head._ _It was obvious to everyone that these two had some serious sexual tension between them. To be fair to Shi__n__ji, Asuka was in a class all of her own._ _It was also clear that Shinji and Asuka cared deeply for each other. It was far beyond a small crush. This was young love, plain and simple. But it was filled with complications. Both were too damaged, too broken to understand each other properly. Shinji, whose fear of abandonment leads him to be a self-hating passive punching bag. Asuka, whose fear of loneliness forces her to project a false image of herself that her heart hates and_ _forces her to_ _unleash her pain onto the world._  
Misato 微微一笑，看着两个孩子从椅子上站起，Asuka 的脸几乎贴着 Shinji 的。Shinji 意外地表现出难得的勇气，面对愤怒的 Asuka 毫不退缩。大家都看得出，他们之间存在着明显的性张力。必须承认，Asuka 确实独树一帜。同时，Shinji 和 Asuka 对彼此的深情也是显而易见的。这不仅仅是浅浅的迷恋，而是纯粹的青春之爱。然而，这段感情充满了复杂性。两人都因内心的创伤而难以真正理解对方。Shinji 因害怕被遗弃而变得自我厌恶，成了被动的受气包。 明日香因害怕孤独，不得不伪装出一个连自己内心都厌恶的形象，并将痛苦倾泻于世。

_Understanding girls at Shinji's age was already near impossible but the boy seemed settled on the Herculean task of seeking Asuka's embrace. So if Shinji wanted to be with Asuka, Misato was going to help him anyway she could, even if that meant setting up some silly and frankly childish situations so the two could be together, the very thing they both desperately want.  
理解像真嗣这般年纪的女孩本就难如登天，然而他似乎铁了心要追求明日香的拥抱。既然真嗣渴望与明日香相伴，美里便决心尽其所能助他一臂之力，哪怕是安排些幼稚可笑的场合，只为让两人得以相聚，这正是他们内心深处的渴望。_

_**"After all"**_ _Misato thought contently as Asuka and Shinji stood nose to nose, shouting with flush cheeks and longing in their eyes_ _**"I just want you two to be happy"**_  
毕竟" 美里心满意足地看着，明日香和真嗣面对面，脸颊绯红，眼中闪烁着渴望，大声喊着 "我真心希望你们俩能幸福

_Present day 现代_

So weeks passed and Asuka hadn't given Misato's threat any thought. Shinji, with an impressive foresight and self preservation techniques that he honed to perfection, bought a costume on the off chance Misato did remember. Worst case, he was wrong and spent some money on a costume he did not need. Best case, he was right and saved pride, face and got to choose what he wanted to wear for Halloween night, and telling by Asuka's protests, he was indeed right.  
几周时间悄然流逝，明日香并未将美里的警告当回事。然而，真嗣凭借其敏锐的预感和自我保护的本能，为了防备美里真的记起，他提前购置了一套服装。最糟糕的情况是他多虑了，白白花费了金钱购买一件无用的装扮。而最佳的结果则是他料事如神，不仅保全了颜面，还能随心所欲地挑选万圣节之夜的着装，从明日香的反应来看，他的确是明智之举。

"Shinji!" Misatos head popped out of Asuka's room, her face tight as if she was holding some struggling animal, "Do you have a costume?" "Y-Yes Misato. I'll put it on after I finish with dinner" Shinji answered quickly, praying that Misato believed him and didn't force him into something embarrassing. Misato's face broke into a sweet smile "Oh good. I guess I'll be returning the Chewbecca costume I got you" Out of nowhere, Misato grimaced in pain and disappeared back into the bedroom leaving Shinji to quietly muse what exactly was a "Chewbecca" Shinji turned back to the meal and checked one last time. He liked this apartment, it was his first real home in...well ever and he hated the idea of leaving it for whatever reason: Be it angel, flood or even Misato's attempting to cook.  
"真嗣！" 美里从明日香的房间探出头，表情紧绷，仿佛正抓着一只挣扎的动物，"你有服装吗？" "有...有的，美里。我做完晚饭就穿。" 真嗣急忙回答，希望美里相信他，不会逼他做尴尬的事。美里脸上露出甜美的微笑，"太好了。那我就把你那件楚巴卡服装退掉吧。" 突然，美里痛苦地皱眉，又退回卧室，留下真嗣暗自琢磨"楚巴卡"究竟是什么。真嗣转回料理台，再次确认了一遍。他喜欢这个公寓，这是他第一个真正的家，他不愿因任何原因离开：无论是天使、洪水，还是美里尝试下厨。

Shinji heard the shuffling of feet coming from the living room and realized that Asuka must've finally lost and gave into the costume Misato picked out for her. Silently vowing to go easy on his roommate, Shinji covered Asuka's and his bowls with saran wrap and placed them in the fridge. "Come on Shinji, Asuka-chan can't wait to show you her costume!" Misato stifled a giggle but Asuka was oddly quiet. With a sense of dread at Misato's sudden use of honorifics, Shinji slowly turned around. He met Asuka's eyes which were very passive especially given what embarrassing thing Misato had given her to wear. Shinji couldn't understand how she could be so quiet wearing..._that_ of all things. Shinji also couldn't remember his name.  
真嗣听到客厅传来脚步声，意识到明日香终究还是屈服了，穿上了美里为她挑选的服装。他暗自发誓要对室友宽容些，用保鲜膜封好明日香和自己的碗，放入冰箱。"快来，真嗣，明日香急着要给你展示她的新装扮呢！"美里掩嘴偷笑，而明日香却出奇地沉默。对美里突然使用敬语感到一丝不安，真嗣缓缓转过身。他迎上明日香那异常平静的目光，尤其是想到美里让她穿的那件令人尴尬的衣服。真嗣不解她怎能如此安静地穿着...那件衣服。他甚至记不起自己的名字了。

The problem when you live with the most beautiful girl that you were madly in love with was simple: She looked amazing no matter what. Just awaking up from a fitful night of sleep? Beautiful. In a dreary and dull looking school uniform? Sexy. Shinji thought Asuka was stunning at any given moment. There was only one problem that could top the first: Whenever Asuka had to dress up, Shinji's was so awestruck he usually forgot to do important things. Like close his mouth or breath. He also had a tendency to stare and once in a rare moment, justified the name hentai with his uncontrollable thoughts.  
与自己深爱的最美女孩同住，问题其实很简单：她无论何时都美得令人窒息。即便刚从不安的睡眠中醒来，或是身着单调的校服，她都散发着性感的魅力。真嗣觉得明日香在任何时刻都美得令人惊艳。然而，有一个问题比这更甚：每当明日香精心打扮时，真嗣总是看得目瞪口呆，以至于常常忘记做重要的事情，比如合上嘴巴或呼吸。他还会不自觉地盯着她看，偶尔在罕见的时刻，他的失控思绪会让他名副其实地被称为“变态”。

The costume Misato had picked up for Asuka had been a cheerleader outfit. It was a shade of red that matched her hair with white and black trims. Stitched in the upper...umm chest area were the initials NERV though the signature leaf was missing. Nevermind, Asuka's red hair had pulled into two long pigtails with two NERV-like leaf hair clips. She wore white sneakers and the two red pompoms hang lazily at her sides. Shinji tried to keep eye contact with her but the outfit seemed to hug her just right and seemed very, very short.  
美里给明日香选的啦啦队服是红色的，与她的红发相得益彰，边缘点缀着白色和黑色。上衣胸前缝有 NERV 的缩写字母，但缺少了标志性的叶子图案。不过，明日香的红发扎成了两条长马尾，用两个类似 NERV 标志的叶子发夹固定。她脚踩白色运动鞋，两个红色绒球随意地垂在身旁。真嗣努力与她保持目光接触，但这件衣服紧贴身形，裙摆极短，让人难以忽视。

"So, what do you think Shinji?" Misato asked innocently while secretly trying not to laugh at Shinji's astonished expression. What did Shinji think? Sexy, breathtaking, stunning. "Absolutely Gorgeous" he inadvertently muttered. Misato gave a smile that could rival the Cheshire cat's "What was that Shinji?" Shinji could feel his face flare up "I-i-it looks good" Misato shook Asuka happily "See? I told you you would look good in it. Maybe I should talk to the commander about making you the new NERV mascot" Asuka's emotionless face broke into a familiar snarl "Don't you dare Misato! Gah this has to be illegal! I won't be gawked at by perverted little boys and old men just because NERV might need more money! Now for Kaji" Asuka finished with a dreamy sigh. Misato flicked her nose "Kaji IS an old pervert and it would be illegal" Asuka shot back "You're just jealous that he wouldn't dare look at you if you wore this. I swear if you didn't threatened to blackmail me I would never..." "Blackmail?" Shinji asked curiously but it was the wrong time to jump in. Asuka threw the deepest glare she could at him "Eyes up front Shinji or I'll..." "I-I should go change" Shinji quickly brushed passed the two females and ran into his room.  
"那么，你觉得真嗣怎么样？" 美里装作无辜地问，内心却在努力抑制笑意，看着真嗣那副震惊的表情。真嗣怎么想？性感，令人窒息，惊艳。"真是美得无与伦比"，他不由自主地低语。美里露出了一个足以与柴郡猫相媲美的笑容，"你刚才说什么，真嗣？" 真嗣感到自己的脸颊发热，结结巴巴地说："我...我觉得很好看。" 美里开心地摇晃着明日香，"看吧？我就知道你穿这个会很合适。或许我该和指挥官商量一下，让你成为 NERV 的新吉祥物。" 明日香那原本无表情的脸突然露出了熟悉的怒容，"你敢，美里！这绝对违法！我可不想因为 NERV 可能需要更多资金，就被那些猥琐的小男孩和老男人盯着看！接下来是加持"，明日香带着梦幻般的叹息结束了对话。 碇真嗣急忙从两位女性身旁溜过，冲进了自己的房间。

Misato stared knowingly at Asuka "Just Shinji huh?" Asuka's face was redder than Shinji's had been "Shut up. I forgot to add baka is all." "Mhm. Sure. I saw how your eyes lit up when he said you were gorgeous" Asuka wondered if she kept turning red, would her face permanently match her hair? "Psst, he...he's just trying to...umm" Asuka couldn't finish that thought. Just standing out here in front of the boy had made her more nervous than her first angel battle. How did Misato expect her to be alone with him? Alone with Shinji. Asuka's heart raced wildly at the idea. "Misato" Asuka said in a quiet tone. Misato turned to the young girl "Yes Asuka?" The look in Asuka's eyes made Misato worry for a moment "You...You won't tell him. Will you?" Misato lightly ruffled Asuka's hair "No I won't" Asuka relaxed a bit. At least that was one worry off her shoulders.  
美里意味深长地看着明日香，“就叫真嗣，对吧？”明日香的脸比真嗣的还要红，“别说了，我只是忘了加个笨蛋而已。”“嗯，我看到他夸你漂亮时，你眼睛都亮了。”明日香心想，如果她一直脸红，脸会不会永久变成和头发一样的颜色？“嘘，他...他只是想...呃...”明日香话没说完。只是站在这个男孩面前，她就比第一次面对使徒时还要紧张。美里怎么指望她能和他独处呢？和真嗣独处。这个念头让明日香的心狂跳不已。“美里，”明日香轻声说道。美里转向这个年轻女孩，“怎么了，明日香？”明日香眼中的神情让美里担心了一会儿，“你...你不会告诉他吧？会吗？”Misato 轻柔地拨弄着 Asuka 的头发，'不，我不会的。' Asuka 稍感宽慰。至少这一桩心事算是放下了。

_1 week ago_

_"Baka Shinji" Asuka muttered quietly with none of the malice. When she first came to live with Shinji and Misato, she nearly had a heart attack upon learning that Shinji had been doing the laundry. The mere idea of that little...boy touching her...anything was enough to make Asuka march down to NERV, hop into her EVA and threaten to destroy the Geofront unless she was moved out of that sinful apartment, preferably into Kaji's home. But months went by, her protests ignored and Asuka began to adapt to the Katsuragi household. Something about this place made it feel just like a home. No, it was a home. Asuka's home. She felt more at peace here than she did anywhere else. Maybe it was the fact that she actually had a pet now though she couldn't imagine beer being a regular part of a penguin's diet. Or maybe that she had a comfortable bickering sibling dynamic with Misato. Or just maybe...just maybe it was because Shinji lived there. Shinji, who without hesitation, leapt into a volcano to save her. Whose battle record proved that he would always save the day if she couldn't though Asuka vocally protested otherwise. Who made her feel safe and grounded amongst the teenage drama and angel attacks.  
"笨蛋真嗣"，明日香轻声嘀咕，并无恶意。初来乍到与真嗣和美里同住时，得知真嗣竟在洗衣服，她几乎气得心脏病发。光是想到那个小...男孩碰她的...任何东西，就足以让明日香冲到 NERV，跳进她的 EVA，扬言要摧毁 Geofront，除非她能搬离那罪恶的公寓，最好是搬到加持家。然而，随着时间流逝，她的抗议无人理睬，明日香逐渐适应了葛城家的生活。这里的某种氛围让她感觉就像家一样。没错，这里就是她的家。明日香在这里比在任何地方都感到更加安宁。 可能是因为她现在真的有了宠物，虽然她难以想象啤酒会是企鹅的日常饮食。也可能是因为她和美里之间有着一种温馨的兄妹式拌嘴。更可能的是……只是可能，是因为真嗣住在那里。真嗣，那个毫不迟疑跳入火山救她的人。他的战斗记录显示，如果她力不能及，他总会挺身而出，拯救危局，尽管明日香大声抗议。他让她在青春的纷扰和天使的攻击中感到安心和踏实。_

_That's why it made her furious he did not get the hints she threw his way. Couldn't he see how much she wanted him to hold her? To see her more than a loud and boastful teammate? It was all just light horseplay and teasing, why couldn't he see that? It was just an act, an act anyone who truly loved her could see past. She would never admit this aloud, out of fear of being teased or worse, completely wrong about his feelings. He had to like her like that right? She was Asuka Langely Sohryu! Beautiful and brilliant. It was clear every guy in the world wanted her attention but Shinji didn't seem interested or disinterested. He was just there. Asuka let out a little sigh. She was really pathetic, what did she care about Shinji liking her or not? Plenty of other of fish in the sea. Besides, why had she even been thinking of Shinji this late at night?  
这就是她为何对他未能领会她抛出的暗示感到愤怒。难道他看不出她渴望他的拥抱吗？难道他看不出她不只是个吵闹自夸的队友吗？这一切不过是轻松的嬉戏和调侃，他为何就是看不透呢？这只是一场表演，一场真正爱她的人能看穿的表演。她绝不会大声承认，害怕被嘲笑，更怕完全误解了他的感情。他肯定也喜欢她吧？她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！美丽又聪明。显然全世界的男生都渴望她的关注，但真嗣似乎既不感兴趣也不冷漠。他只是在那里。明日香轻叹一声。她真是可悲，何必在乎真嗣是否喜欢她呢？世上还有许多其他的选择。 再说了，她为何会在夜深人静时想起真嗣呢？_

**"****That's right"** _Asuka_ _thought as she_ _picked up the sole possession of Shinji that ever_ _managed to_ _ma__ke_ _it into her room. It was one of his_ _plain white_ _school shirts. Somehow they had gotten mixed up with a load of her panties and ended up in her room. Though how Shinji missed that was beyond her._ _**"Wait, wasn't I charge of whites?"**_ _Asuka's brain thought in the background but Asuka paid no attention to it. Asuka gingerly picked up the shirt_ _but before she could turn around and return it to the boy, she bit her lip nervously as she stared at the piece of clothing. This was completely embarrassing but she was curious how good their detergent was. After all NERV was the most technically advance organization in the world,_ _if they couldn't get rid of smelly clothes how were they suppose to save the world?_  
“没错。”明日香心想，同时拾起了唯一一件误闯入她房间的真嗣的物品——一件普通的白色校服衬衫。不知怎的，它和她的几条内裤混在了一起，最终出现在她的房间里。真嗣怎么会没注意到这一点，她实在想不通。“等等，洗白衣服不是我负责的吗？”这个念头在明日香脑海中一闪而过，但她并未深究。她小心翼翼地拿起衬衫，正要转身还给真嗣时，却紧张地咬着嘴唇，凝视着那件衣物。虽然尴尬至极，但她还是好奇他们的洗衣粉效果如何。 毕竟 NERV 作为全球技术最尖端的组织，若连衣服的异味都无法消除，又谈何拯救世界呢？

_Asuka held the shirt close to her, chanting her flimsy excuse in her head as she proceeded to lift his shirt to her face and slowly took a deep breath. "Our detergent sucks" She muttered under her breath as Shinji's scent assaulted her nose, sending relaxing sensation through her body. Asuka decided she might as well give him back his stupid, boring shirt since she was up. Asuka turned to the clock then did a double take. 3 A.M? Had she really been awake that long? As tempting as it would be to awake Shinji up and torment him a bit, Asuka decided against it. She didn't want him burning her breakfast out of spite._ _Though she highly doubted he would have the spine to even dare think about it. Asuka would let him sleep this time.__**"But I have to wait 4 more hours before I could see him again"**_ _Asuka's heart whined but Asuka_ _paid no attention to the longing in her heart._  
明日香紧抱着那件衬衫，心中默念着她那牵强的借口，随后将衬衫举至脸前，深深吸了一口气。“我们的洗衣粉真不行。”她轻声自语，真嗣的气息让她感到一阵舒缓。既然已经醒了，她想，还是把这乏味的衬衫还给他吧。她瞥了一眼时钟，不禁一怔。凌晨三点了？她竟然醒了这么久？虽然很想叫醒真嗣，逗弄他一番，但明日香还是决定作罢。她可不想因为他的报复而吃不上早餐，尽管她怀疑他是否有那胆量。这次，她选择让他继续安睡。"可我还得再等四个小时才能见到他"，Asuka 的心里虽有不满，但她并未理会这份渴望。

_Asuka looked around for anything to help her get to sleep but as usual, nothing worked. Nothing ever worked. It was a miracle she functioned as well as she did given the lack of sleep she gets. "Well" Asuka told herself "I am the best. Sleep is for weaklings like Shinji" As soon as his name escaped her mouth, Asuka looked at the shirt she held in her hands. Maybe. It was just this one time and it isn't probably not going to work and Shinji should be honored Asuka would even consider wearing one of his plain shirts! Asuka shook her head as she began to undress, leaving her underwear on as she slipped into Shinji's shirt. At once his scent began tickling her nose and her body fell into a peaceful state though Asuka wasn't aware of this yet. All she could think of is this shirt was not what she expected. Much like its owner. Despite being roughly the same height, Shinji's shirt was long so long it actually reached just above her knees. It also was a little loose too but comfortably so.  
明日香环顾四周，寻找能助她入眠的物品，但一如既往，毫无效果。她从未找到过有效的办法。考虑到她长期缺乏睡眠，她能保持如此良好的状态实属奇迹。"算了"，明日香自语道，"我是最强的。睡觉是像真嗣那样的弱者才需要的"。她一提到他的名字，目光便落在手中的衬衫上。或许，就这一次，可能还是无效，但真嗣应该感到荣幸，明日香竟然会考虑穿他那件普通的衬衫！明日香摇了摇头，开始脱去衣物，只留下内衣，然后穿上真嗣的衬衫。顿时，他的气息扑鼻而来，她的身体不自觉地放松下来，尽管明日香自己还未意识到这一点。 她脑海中浮现的只有一点：这件衬衫与她的期待相去甚远，正如其主人一般。虽然两人身高相仿，真嗣的衬衫却异常长，几乎垂至她的膝盖上方，略显宽松，却也颇为舒适。_

_Asuka let out a yawn as tiredness began tugging at her eyes. "I-it isn't g-g-going to woooooork" She let out_ _as she laid on top of her b__ed__. "Th-this was stuuupid...I'm just going to have to change out of this..." She let out a yawn and the call of sleep was beckoning sweetly to her. "Baka Shinji. H-how could you fooorget to take out your...shirt" Asuka fell asleep, Shinji's scent lulling her into a serene nights rest._  
明日香打了个哈欠，疲倦开始拉扯她的眼皮。“这根本行不通”她躺在床上喃喃自语。“真是蠢...我得换掉这身衣服...”她再次打了个哈欠，睡意甜美地召唤着她。“笨蛋真嗣，你怎么会忘了拿出你的衬衫”明日香沉沉睡去，真嗣的气息让她安然入眠。

_"__Asuka! Wake up!" Asuka's eyes lazily opened halfway as the suns rays gently filtered into her room. Knock, knock. "Come on Asuka, we need to hurry! You have sync tests in an hour!" Asuka stumbled out of bed and made her way to the door, trying to rub her eyes open but feeling far too relax to put too much of an effort into it. "Misato" she called back "Do we have to? As much as I enjoy beating the baka and the doll, I don't like my time wasted." Asuka slid open the door and found herself staring at the Major's already dressed form "Can't I just skip today? I am awfully tired"_  
明日香！醒醒！"明日香的眼睛懒洋洋地半睁着，阳光柔和地透进她的房间。敲门声响起。"明日香，快点，我们得抓紧！你一小时后有同步测试！"明日香跌跌撞撞地从床上起来，走向门口，试图揉开眼睛，但感觉太放松了，不愿费太多力气。"美里"她回应道"非得这样吗？虽然我很享受打败笨蛋和玩偶，但我不喜欢浪费时间。"明日香拉开房门，发现自己正盯着已经穿戴整齐的少校。"我今天能跳过吗？我实在太累了

_Misato's widened for a moment_ _before_ _they seemed to hone in on Asuka as if she had something on her face. Before Asuka could snap at her guardian, Misato's face slipped into a predatory grin, one that actually frightened Asuka."I bet you did. Stealing clothes is very tiring Asuka or did you do something more...__**Physical?**__"_ _Asuka gave her a dirty look "What exactly_ _are you implying Misato?" Misato simply pointed at her outfit._  
美里眼睛睁大了一瞬，随即目光锁定在明日香脸上，仿佛她脸上有异物。在明日香来得及对她监护人发火之前，美里的表情转变成了一种掠食者的微笑，这微笑竟让明日香感到一丝恐惧。"我猜你肯定累了。偷衣服可是个体力活，明日香，还是你干了些更...费劲的事？" 明日香不满地瞪了她一眼，"你到底想说什么，美里？" 美里只是指了指她的衣服。

_"Oh hell..." Asuka muttered mechanically when she realized she was still wearing Shinji's shirt. She felt so at ease, she didn't even realize she fell into a peaceful sleep while wearing it. Of course there was bound to be fallout for this. "M-Misato, it isn't what you think!" Asuka cried, her hands furiously waving back and forth in an effort to make her point. Of course Misato wasn't hearing any of this "Well I didn't think Shinji had it in him. Well I suppose you could've corrupted poor innocent Shinji" "Misato! I just found his shirt in my laundry, that's all!" Asuka had never been more desperate than she had been in this moment. She even stowed her normal attitude to try and stop Misato going even further. Just the thought her and Shinji...just...__**that**_ _filled her with disgust, and a sick sensation and longing and sent a shiver down her body and..._ _**"Wait, what?"**_ _Asuka thought, backpedaling to the last 2 thoughts._  
"哦，糟糕..." 明日香机械地喃喃自语，意识到自己仍穿着真嗣的衬衫。她感到异常安心，以至于穿着它不知不觉陷入了甜美的梦乡。当然，这免不了会引起一些误会。"Misato，事情不是你想的那样！" 明日香急切地解释，双手不停地挥动，试图澄清。然而，Misato 对此充耳不闻。"真没想到真嗣会这样。看来你已经把单纯的他带坏了。" "Misato！我只是无意中在洗衣篮里发现了他的衬衫而已！" 明日香此刻感到前所未有的绝望。她甚至放下了平日的傲气，试图阻止 Misato 继续误解。一想到她和真嗣之间可能被误解的关系...就让她心烦意乱。这让她心生厌恶，伴随着一阵恶心与渴望，令她浑身一颤，接着... "等等，什么？" 明日香心中一惊，迅速回想起前两个念头。

_"__Misato" Both females froze as Shinji's voice called out from his room. "Yes Shinji?" Misato replied in an innocent tone but looked at Asuka with an evil gleam in her eyes. "__I think I'm missing a shirt. I swore I asked Asuka to put the loads in the dryer._ _All of my clothes are here except th__is_ _one shirt and_ _I can't see__m_ _to find it any where. Have you seen it?" Misato's smile seemed to be getting impossibly wide. Asuka's eyes just widen in fear. She would never live this down if Shin__ji_ _found out. Shinji himself could probably care less but somehow she knew the stooges would find out and then she'd be the laughing stock of the school! It was bad enough some strange, other worldly force had compelled the entire school to call them the newlyweds but this would just fan the flames_ _further._ _Before Misato could reply, Asuka grabbed the helm of her shirt and quietly repeated "Please don't. Please Don't. Please Don't"_ _Misato decided to give the girl a break. After all, she was acting very out of character, all over a shirt. "__No Shinji, I'm sorry. Don't worry we can always get you another one" "Okay, thanks!"_  
"Misato" 当真嗣的声音从房间传来时，两位女性都愣住了。"怎么了，真嗣？" 美里用无辜的语气回应，但瞥向明日香的眼神中却闪过一丝狡黠。"我好像丢了一件衬衫。我记得我让明日香把衣服都放进烘干机了。除了这件衬衫，其他衣服都在，但我怎么也找不到它。你看见了吗？" 美里的笑容愈发夸张。明日香的眼神中满是惊恐。如果真嗣发现了这件事，她将永远无法摆脱这个耻辱。真嗣本人可能并不在意，但她知道那些家伙肯定会发现，然后她就会成为学校的笑柄！已经有某种奇怪的、超自然的力量让全校都称他们为新婚夫妇，这只会让事情变得更糟。 美里还未来得及回应，明日香便抓住她的衣领，低声连说：“请别这样。请别这样。请别这样。”考虑到明日香因一件衬衫而异常失态，美里决定宽容她。“真嗣，抱歉了。别担心，我们还可以再给你买一件的。”“好的，谢谢！”"

_Asuka let out a relaxed sigh but realized it was far too soon to be comfortable. Misato glanced at her with a look in her eye that said "You so owe me" and walked off with a grin on her face. Asuka wondered how high was the cost of the Major's silence. "It couldn't be that bad...could it?" Asuka asked herself as she walked back into her room and with a large amount of reluctance, took off the one thing that managed to bring her a calm, peaceful sleep.  
明日香轻舒一口气，却立刻意识到放松还为时尚早。美里向她投去意味深长的一瞥，仿佛在说“你可欠我一次”，随后带着得意的笑容离去。明日香暗自揣测，要换取这位少校的沉默，代价究竟会有多高。“总不会太离谱吧...会吗？”她自言自语，回到房间，极不情愿地脱下了那件唯一能让她安然入睡的物品。_

Present day 现代

"Of course the price was too high" Asuka muttered to herself, trying not to look at herself in the mirror. Misato refused to allow Asuka to see how bad the costume looked on her. "Oh Asuka you are always saying how beautiful you are and teasing Shinji" Misato told her "I thought I would get a costume that allow you to prove it" Asuka stuck out her tongue. This was going too far! Granted she felt very special when Shinji used the word gorgeous, a word she was sure was not in his vocabulary but still, this made her feel too expose. "I should've kept my mouth shut" Asuka grumbled as she finally gave into vanity and looked into the mirror. Well...she _did_ look good. Beautiful yet sexy at the same time. Misato chuckled a bit before a thought popped into her mind. "Hey Asuka. What ever happened to Shinji's shirt?" Asuka could feel her face reheating "I threw it away! I have my pride to maintain you know and it's embarrassing enough that you knew what I did." Of course that was a lie. The shirt was actually hidden underneath her mattress. For the last week, Asuka slept through the nightmares and had pleasant dreams for once though she could never remember them when she awoke.  
"当然，这价格太离谱了。" 明日香喃喃自语，尽量不去看镜子中的自己。美里不让明日香看到这身装扮有多糟糕。"哦，明日香，你总夸自己漂亮，还逗真嗣。" 美里说，"我想给你买件能证明这点的衣服。" 明日香做了个鬼脸。这太过火了！确实，当真嗣用"华丽"这个词时，她感到很特别，她知道这不是他的常用词，但即便如此，这让她感觉太暴露了。"我真该闭嘴。" 明日香嘟囔着，最终还是忍不住看向了镜子。嗯...她确实看起来很美。既美丽又性感。美里轻笑一声，突然一个念头闪过她的脑海。"嘿，明日香。 “真嗣的衬衫后来怎样了？”明日香感到脸颊再次发热，“我扔了！我得维护自己的尊严，你已经知道我做了什么，这已经够让人难堪的了。”当然，这是谎话。其实，那件衬衫被她藏在了床垫下。过去一周，明日香在噩梦中安然入睡，难得做了些愉快的梦，尽管醒来后总是记不清。

"I wonder what lame costume Shinji chose" Asuka taunted outloud, desperate to change the conversation to familiar territory. Misato placed her finger under her chin thoughtfully "I'm not sure, he's been awfully quiet about his costume. I wasn't even sure he got one until a few minutes ago" "Well Shinji's not usually into holidays so he probably didn't put that much effort into it." "Actually" Misato cut in "He told me he loves Halloween, back when he use to celebrate it" Asuka perked up. Shinji rarely talked about himself so she had to rely on other sources of information to know more about her elusive teammate. "Oh? Why is that Misato?" Asuka asked curiously. Misato simply gave her a sad smile "Sorry, that's a secret Asuka"  
"我想知道真嗣挑了什么蹩脚的装扮"，明日香大声挑衅，急于将话题引向熟悉的领域。美里若有所思地用手指轻触下巴，"我不太清楚，他对自己的装扮一直守口如瓶。直到刚才我还以为他没准备呢。" "其实，真嗣对节日向来不太上心，估计也没怎么费心准备。" "不过"，美里打断道，"他跟我说过他很喜欢万圣节，以前庆祝的时候"。明日香顿时来了兴趣。真嗣很少谈及个人，她只能通过其他途径来了解这位神秘队友。"哦？那是为什么呢，美里？" 明日香好奇地追问。美里只是对她露出一个略带哀伤的微笑，"抱歉，这是秘密，明日香"。

Before Asuka could pout, Asuka could hear Shinji's footsteps coming from his room. "About time Baka Shinji. Any longer and..." Asuka turned around and realized maybe that was not best course of action. Her mouth dropped and for a moment she forgot who she was looking at. She knew it was Shinji but Shinji couldn't possibly be that handsome. Well he was but seeing him dress up was like..**"AH! Get a grip Asuka!"** But she couldn't even blink, let alone shield her heart from her deepest emotions. All of her bottled up emotions were pouring out and she couldn't stop them. She didn't want to.  
在明日香还没来得及撅嘴时，她已听到真嗣从房间传来的脚步声。"真嗣，你总算来了。再晚点我可……"她转过身，意识到这或许不是明智之举。她的嘴惊讶地张大，一时间竟忘了眼前是谁。她知道是真嗣，但真嗣怎么可能如此英俊。尽管他确实帅气，可见他如此打扮，简直……"啊！明日香，稳住！"她连眨眼都做不到，更别提保护自己的心不受深藏情感的冲击。所有压抑的情感如洪水般涌出，她无法阻止，也不愿阻止。

Shinji was wearing a white collared shirt with a black tie that was tucked into a pinstripe vest. His black dress pants were freshly pressed to perfection and his black loafers were so polished the light reflected off them. In his vest pocket was a red rose with a black ribbon. Around his frame was a long, black cloak that gave him the appearance of being much more burly than he really was. His hair was slicked back with gel under a black fedora and his one blue eye seemed to shine with a devious intention. Asuka paused. One eye? On the right side of Shinji's face was white mask that perfectly covered one side of his face but Asuka could see a bit of his other eye underneath.  
真嗣身着白色翻领衬衫，黑色领带整齐地塞在细条纹背心内。他的黑色西裤熨烫得笔挺，黑色乐福鞋擦得光亮，能映出倒影。背心口袋中插着一朵系有黑色丝带的红玫瑰。他披着一件长长的黑色斗篷，显得比实际更为壮硕。头发用发胶梳得服帖，头顶一顶黑色软呢帽，一只蓝色的眼睛似乎闪着狡猾的光芒。明日香顿了顿，注意到他只有一只眼睛可见。真嗣的右脸被一个白色面具完美遮盖，但明日香仍能瞥见面具下露出的另一只眼睛。

"Who...who are you?" Asuka asked, completely stunned how well Shinji cleaned up. "I know! You are the Phantom of the Opera!" Misato cried out loud, happy she actually remembered something from college. Shinji nodded "Well it is my own take on it but yeah. I'm Shinji the Phantom." Asuka wanted to say an insult or tease him but all she could think is that she never noticed how handsome he really was. How come she never noticed it before? Or had she? "Say cheese!" Asuka looked up and was blinded by a sudden flash. Misato giggled as she checked the photo she had just taken of the children. "Hey! A little warning next time! I better look good in that picture or else!" Asuka screeched at her guardian. Suddenly there was shuffling of shoes and Asuka found herself pressed against Shinji's chest, his arms wrapped around her shoulder. "Then let's take a nice picture, right Asuka? Just to make sure" Asuka turned to find Shinji grinning like an idiot in her direction. "Ye-yeah" Asuka felt the wild beating of her heart as she stared into Misato's camera and gave as huge a smile as the boy next to her.  
"你...你是谁？" 明日香惊讶地问道，没想到真嗣打扮得如此出色。"我知道了！你是歌剧魅影！" 美里兴奋地喊道，庆幸自己还记得大学时的知识。真嗣点头承认："虽然是我个人的演绎，但没错。我是真嗣，歌剧魅影。" 明日香本想嘲讽或调侃他，但此刻她满脑子都是自己以前怎么没发现他其实很帅气。难道她真的从未察觉？还是她其实早已留意？"笑一个！" 明日香抬头时被突如其来的闪光灯晃得睁不开眼。美里咯咯笑着查看刚拍的照片。"嘿！下次提前说一声！我最好在照片里看起来不错，不然有你好看！" 明日香对着她的监护人尖叫道。 突然，一阵脚步声响起，明日香发现自己被真嗣紧紧抱在怀里，他的双臂环绕着她的肩膀。“那我们就拍张漂亮的照片吧，怎么样，明日香？只是为了留个纪念。”明日香转头，看到真嗣正朝她露出傻乎乎的笑容。“嗯，好的。”明日香感到自己的心跳加速，她对着美里手中的相机，露出了与旁边的男孩同样灿烂的笑容。

"Bye you two! Have fun!" Misato shouted from the apartment door then hurriedly slammed it shut. "I bet she's going to have a drinking contest with Penpen" Shinji mused. Asuka looked at him again. He still looked like Shinji but he was acting way different. Maybe the gel seeped into his brain or maybe the mask was possessed by an evil ghost! There was no way Shinji would even think about hugging her or making fun of Misato. "Hey Asuka, let's go" Shinji snapped her out of her thoughts. Asuka huffed and walked away a few steps before realizing Shinji wasn't following her. She peered back and found Shinji smiling at her but hadn't moved an inch. "Hey Baka, what are you waiting around for?" "For you to hold my hand of course" Asuka's face dropped, another blush coming onto her face. Seriously what was with this night? "A-and why would I hold your hand baka, hentai Shinji!" She shouted, screaming a little group of children away from her. Shinji answered "You said I was so wimpy, I was going to need Misato to hold my hand door to door and since she isn't here..." Shinji held his hand out expectantly. "I am not holding your hand! What are you a baby?" Asuka closed her eyes and turned away. The nerve of the idiot. Holding hands...like we're a couple! **"Would that really be so bad?"** Asuka's heart asked. **"Yes?"** Asuka answered unsure of herself. "Okay Asuka" Shinji replied. Suddenly her right hand felt warm as Shinji grasped it. Asuka's eyes opened and she found herself being pulled along by Shinji. "If you won't hold my hand, I'll just hold yours!" Shinji said with a cute smile. Asuka could die of embarrassment but his hand did feel nice in hers...and right. Like they were the perfect size for each other.  
"再见你们俩！玩得开心！" 真嗣在公寓门口大声喊着，随即匆忙关上门。"我敢说，她肯定要和 Penpen 比拼喝酒了。" 真嗣暗自思忖。明日香再次看向他，他依旧是真嗣的模样，但举止却迥然不同。或许是发胶渗入了大脑，亦或是面具被邪灵附体了！真嗣绝不会想到要拥抱她，或是取笑真嗣。"嘿，明日香，我们走吧。" 真嗣的话打断了她的思绪。明日香哼了一声，走了几步，却发现真嗣并未跟上。她回头一望，只见真嗣正对着她微笑，却纹丝未动。"喂，笨蛋，你在磨蹭什么？" "当然是等你牵我的手啦。" 明日香的脸色一沉，脸上再次泛起了红晕。 这个晚上到底怎么了？“再说，我干嘛要牵你的手啊，笨蛋，色狼真嗣！”她大声喊着，吓跑了一群小孩。真嗣回应说：“你不是说我太懦弱，得让美里从门口到门口都牵着我的手吗，既然她不在……”真嗣满怀期待地伸出手。“我可不要牵你的手！你以为你是小孩吗？”明日香闭上眼，转过身去。这个傻瓜的胆子真大。牵手……好像我们是情侣似的！“那样真的不行吗？”明日香的心里嘀咕。“不行吗？”明日香自己也不确定。“好吧，明日香。”真嗣说。突然，她的右手感到一阵温暖，因为真嗣握住了它。明日香的眼睛睁开了，她发现自己正被真嗣拉着走。“既然你不愿意牵我的手，那我就牵你的！”真嗣带着可爱的笑容说：‘明日香羞得几乎要晕过去，但他的手握在她的手里感觉很舒服...而且恰到好处。仿佛他们的手天生就适合彼此。’

"treat or trick!" Shinji shouted, gleeful as his bag rose with more candy. "Trick or treat' Asuka replied with as much enthusiasm. "What a cute couple" The kindly old lady told them as they walked off. This was the 9th time she had heard that but she found herself caring less and less about denying it and more and more wondering if it was a possibility. At the first house, Asuka gave a halfhearted "T and t" Vowing to kill Misato when she came back to the apartment. By the 5th house she got more into the season, caring less about what people and just enjoyed the time with Shinji whose new found energy seemed infectious. By the 15th house Asuka had inadvertently turned candy gathering into a competition, one that Shinji did not shrink away from but embraced wholeheartedly. They were laughing, smiling and Asuka even let Shinji continue to hold her hand not even caring if she was losing to Shinji. It felt nice to not have a care in the world.  
"不给糖就捣蛋！" 真嗣兴奋地喊着，看着自己的糖果袋越来越鼓。"捣蛋还是给糖" 明日香同样热情地回应。"真是一对可爱的小情侣"，一位慈祥的老妇人看着他们离开时说道。这是她第九次听到这样的话，但她发现自己越来越不在意去否认，反而开始好奇这会不会成真。在第一户人家前，明日香半心半意地说了声"T and t"，心里暗暗发誓要找三笠算账。到了第五户人家，她开始更加享受这个节日，不再在乎旁人的眼光，只是单纯地享受与真嗣共度的时光，真嗣那股新激发的活力似乎感染了她。到了第十五户人家，明日香不知不觉中将收集糖果变成了一场比赛，真嗣并未退缩，而是全情投入其中。 他们笑逐颜开，明日香任由真嗣握着她的手，丝毫不介意自己是否在真嗣面前示弱。那种无忧无虑的感觉真好。

"See Asuka, this is fun right?" Shinji asked her as they stepped away from the 24th house. "Yeah I guess it is" Asuka replied with a smile. Asuka peered at Shinji as their hands entwined with one another. This Shinji was nothing like the Shinji she knew but maybe it had always been there. Maybe he just never had a reason to let it out. Asuka always felt safe and at ease with Shinji but this happy night was also tense. An exception of sorts but she could not for the life of her figure out what exactly was she expecting. "Hey Shinji" Asuka asked, remembering what she had asked Misato at the apartment. "Hmm? Yes Asuka?" "Shinji, why do you like Halloween so much?" There was silence and Asuka could feel Shinji's grip loosen on her hand, his infectious energy dying down with each passing moment. "Shinji?" Asuka couldn't keep the concern from her voice. Just as Shinji's was about hand completely let go, Asuka held onto it as if it was life itself but couldn't figure out why she had done that. "You...You don't have to answer if you don't want to" Asuka said meekly.  
"看啊，明日香，这很有趣吧？" 真嗣在他们离开第 24 栋房子时问道。"嗯，我想是的。" 明日香微笑着回答，目光停留在真嗣身上，两人的手紧紧相扣。这个真嗣与她所熟知的不同，或许他本就如此，只是未曾有机会展现。与真嗣在一起，明日香总感到安全和放松，但这个欢乐的夜晚也夹杂着一丝紧张。这是一种例外，她却难以捉摸自己究竟在期待什么。"嘿，真嗣。" 明日香想起在公寓里问美里的话，便开口问道。"嗯？什么事，明日香？" "真嗣，你为什么这么喜欢万圣节？" 沉默中，明日香感觉到真嗣握着她的手渐渐松开，他那充满感染力的热情也随之消退。 "真嗣？" 明日香的声音透露出担忧。就在真嗣的手快要完全放开时，明日香紧紧握住，如同抓住生命线一般，却不明白自己为何如此。"你...如果不想说，可以不用回答" 明日香轻声说道。

Shinji mumbled but Asuka couldn't hear a word. "baka, I couldn't hear you" Asuka said in her familiar but dulled down tone. "I said it's the only day I don't have to be me" The pair stopped in shock of what they just did: Shinji telling her the truth and Asuka for what he said. Before Asuka could interject, Shinji went on "I hate being me. My father hates me and never wanted me, my mother is gone. My caretaker didn't actually care about me I'm not sure anyone at NERV does...I love Halloween because I don't have to be Shinji Ikari. For one day I can be anyone else..." The silence was heavy.  
真嗣低声嘟囔，明日香却一个字也没听清。“笨蛋，我听不见你。”明日香用她那熟悉却略显沉闷的语气说道。“我说这是我唯一不用做自己的一天。”两人因刚才的坦白而震惊地停下脚步：真嗣向她吐露了心声，而明日香则因他的话感到震惊。在明日香开口之前，真嗣继续说道：“我讨厌做我自己。我父亲讨厌我，从未想要我，我母亲已经去世。我的监护人其实并不关心我，我不确定 NERV 的任何人是否真的在乎我……我喜欢万圣节，因为那天我不必是碇真嗣。那一天我可以成为任何人……”沉默沉重。

"Well Baka Shinj you are wrong" Asuka gripped his hand tightly, trying to comfort the boy all she could. Shinji turned to her, his sadness pulling at her heartstrings. "I'm wrong?" Shinji asked in his usual tone. "Who cares about your ass of a father? You have a new family! Misato. Penpen And you know what, you're my friend and I care about you even if you're a baka." Shinji gave her a grateful smile "You're my friend too Asuka. Thanks. It means a lot. Come on! Let's go more candy!" The infectious energy was back in full force and Asuka felt relieved when Shinji squeezed her hand in appreciation. But she felt hollow when she told him that he was her friend. That's what she wanted right? Or did she crave something more?  
"笨蛋真嗣，你错了。" 明日香紧握他的手，尽力安慰。真嗣转向她，眼中的悲伤触动了她的心。"我错了吗？" 他一如往常地问道。"谁在乎你那糟糕的父亲？你有新家了！美里、企鹅，还有，你是我的朋友，即使你是个笨蛋，我也关心你。" 真嗣感激地笑了，"你也是我的朋友，明日香。谢谢你，这对我很重要。走吧！我们再去拿点糖果！" 那股充满活力的热情再次涌现，当真嗣感激地握紧她的手时，明日香感到宽慰。但当她告诉他他是她的朋友时，她内心却感到空虚。这真的是她所渴望的吗？还是她心中另有期待？

"Shinji, let's skip this house" Asuka said, her anger growing rapidly. Shinji looked at Asuka and saw a scowl he hadn't seen for most of the night. "Why Asuka?" Shinji wondered what exactly was wrong with this house. "I...I don't like the color! And the decorations are tacky" Shinji gave said decorations a look over: A plastic skeleton, some fake graves, even a ghost hanging from a tree. The house was a pale sky blue. "Asuka, We'll only be here for a moment. Come on!" Shinji hurried the pace so Asuka wouldn't have to deal with whatever reason she didn't like this house. Asuka could feel her anger grow and grow as they came closer to the front door. She tried to come up with another excuse to avoid the house but she could not come up with anything that wouldn't end their night early.  
"真嗣，我们跳过这栋房子吧。"明日香说道，怒气迅速上涌。真嗣望向她，看到了整晚少见的怒容。"为什么呢，明日香？"他疑惑这房子有何不妥。"我...我不喜欢这颜色！装饰也俗不可耐。"真嗣扫视了一番那些装饰：塑料骷髅、假墓碑，还有树上挂着的鬼魂。房子是淡天蓝色的。"明日香，我们只停留片刻。走吧！"真嗣加快脚步，免得明日香因任何理由而反感这栋房子。随着他们接近前门，明日香的怒火愈发炽烈。她试图找借口避开，却想不出任何不提前结束夜晚的理由。

Knock, knock. Asuka wondered if she could drag Shinji away before the door opened. "I'm coming" A female voice replied. Asuka's narrowed, it was _her_ house. The door opened to reveal a girl roughly the age of Shinji and Asuka. She had short, reddish brownish hair which done in ringlets and wore an old fashion dress, much like you would see in an old timey movies from Pre-impact. She had grayish blue eyes which at once honed in on Shinji and showed disgust at Asuka. "Oh hello Shinji, Asuka" She said with a force smile at one of their names. Mana Kirishima, an upper classman who just moved to Tokyo-3 a few months ago. Normally Asuka wouldn't have known so much about the girl in front of her except she had unsettling rumors that Mana wanted to ask Shinji out.  
敲门声响起，明日香心想能否在门开之前把真嗣带走。“来了。”一个女声应道。明日香眉头微皱，这是她的家。门开了，出现了一个与真嗣和明日香年纪相仿的女孩。她留着短短的红棕色卷发，穿着一件复古风格的裙子，仿佛来自大灾难前的老电影。她那灰蓝色的眼睛立刻盯上了真嗣，对明日香则显露出不悦。“哦，真嗣，明日香，你们好。”她对其中一人的名字勉强挤出笑容。桐岛万那，一个高年级的学生，几个月前刚搬到第三新东京市。通常明日香不会对眼前的女孩了解这么多，除了那些令人不安的传闻——桐岛万那似乎对真嗣有意思。

So for the last few weeks Asuka may or may not have been gathering Intel on her now found riv...er school mate. However, Asuka was never Section 2 material. Mana had confronted her about her recent activities to which Asuka politely (Or violently depending on who you asked) denied. Mana then had the nerve to ask Asuka if Shinji and her were dating. To which again she responded no (With a hell in front) in a "polite" tone. Mana gave her a wide smile and told Asuka that if she wasn't willing to take a chance on happiness, Mana would happily take Shinji off her hands if Asuka did not want him. Needless to say all encounters with Mana since then have been rather eventful.  
因此，在最近几周，明日香或许一直在暗中搜集关于她新发现的学校对手的情报。尽管如此，明日香并不适合第二部门。真奈曾质疑她近期的行为，而明日香则以礼貌（或根据询问对象，可能是激烈）的方式予以否认。随后，真奈竟大胆询问明日香是否与真嗣交往，明日香再次以“绝不”（语气中带着一丝愤怒）回应。真奈对明日香露出宽慰的微笑，并表示如果明日香不愿追求幸福，她很愿意接手真嗣，如果明日香不想要他的话。自那以后，与真奈的每次相遇都颇具波折。

So here Asuka was, attempting not rip off Mana's face as Mana tried making small talk with Shinji. "Oh, the Phantom I see." Mana said with a giggle, twirling her curly hair. Shinji nodded "I'm surprise anyone even got it given how old it is." "I did. In fact, I'm actually Christine from the play as well. See?" She twirled around a bit in her dress. Asuka huffed in anger. "You're mighty cute phantom" Mana took a step closer. Shinji could hardly say a word. It wasn't every day a pretty girl was giving so much attention to him that wasn't teasing and taunting. "y-yeah but too bad I have a burned face" Shinji replied meekly. "Oh phantom! You face does not hold horrors for me! But rather your soul!" Mana tried in a false, fake accent, cursing herself for not remembering actual dialogue from the play.  
就这样，明日香站在那里，极力克制自己不去撕扯真名的脸，而真名正试图与真嗣搭话。“哦，原来是幽灵啊。”真名笑着说，一边卷弄着自己的卷发。真嗣点头道：“真没想到还有人记得它，毕竟它已经这么古老了。”“我记得。其实，我在剧中也扮演克里斯汀。看？”她穿着裙子转了一圈。明日香气愤地哼了一声。“你这个幽灵挺可爱的嘛。”真名又靠近了一步。真嗣几乎说不出话来。不是每天都有漂亮女孩如此关注他，而不是戏弄和嘲讽。“是-是的，可惜我的脸被烧伤了。”真嗣怯生生地回答。“哦，幽灵！你的脸对我来说并不恐怖！而是你的灵魂！玛娜尝试用一种假惺惺的口音，心里暗骂自己怎么就记不住剧里的台词。

"Shinji, you burned your face!?" Asuka had been so caught up ignoring the two that only heard burned face from Shinji and panicked. Asuka moved towards Shinji and quickly removed the mask, her hands on either side of his head. Asuka found herself now looking into both his steel blue eyes, his face perfectly fine. In fact he looked much better without the mask and his eyes were so deep, she could feel herself getting lost in a depth of emotion she never knew he had. "Wow Asuka, I didn't know you spaced out that much. It's all _fake_" Mana scolded her, putting all her emphasis on the word fake. Asuka whirled to Mana but Shinji simply grabbed her hand and bolted away from the house. "Sorry, we have candy to collect!" Shinji shouted behind him,. He had seen the look in Asuka's eyes towards the girl and he didn't want Asuka to put in jail for assault. Asuka turned around to see Mana mouthing "He's mine" "In your dreams" she mouthed back.  
"真嗣，你的脸怎么烧伤了！？" 明日香原本正忙着对两人视而不见，只听到真嗣提到"烧伤的脸"便慌了神。她快步走向真嗣，迅速摘下他的面具，双手捧着他的脸。此刻，她发现自己正凝视着他那双深邃的钢蓝色眼睛，他的面容完好如初。不戴面具的他看起来更加精神，那双眼睛仿佛藏着无尽的情感，让她不禁深陷其中。"哇，明日香，你竟然这么容易走神。这都是假的" 玛娜责备道，特意加重了"假的"二字。明日香刚想反驳玛娜，真嗣却一把抓住她的手，带着她逃离了屋子。"抱歉，我们还得去收集糖果呢！" 真嗣边跑边喊。 他察觉到明日香对那女孩的目光，不希望明日香因攻击他人而入狱。明日香转身，见真奈无声地说“他是我的”，她则回以“别做梦了”。

The two walked aimlessly around, agreeing on a tie for their competition and decided they should something else than candy hunting before heading back home. While the elated energy was still there, the two were lost in their own thoughts. Shinji and how Asuka's face peered at him with concern and astonished eyes as if she had been seeing him for the first time. Asuka, realizing how handsome Shinji was and how much soul his eyes held. It was a confusing time to be the two children but Asuka was determined to put that behind them. "Shinji, in here!" Asuka said, taking charge for the first time since the night began. "A haunted house Asuka? I-I don't want to get scared" Shinji replied nervously. "Come on you baby, you got the great Asuka Langely Sohryu with you! You have nothing to worry about." Asuka said with a confident smile.  
两人漫无目的地游荡，同意以平局结束比赛，并决定在回家前尝试些与寻糖无关的活动。尽管兴奋劲儿还在，两人却各自陷入了沉思。真嗣注意到明日香关切而惊讶地凝视着他，仿佛初次相见。明日香意识到真嗣的英俊和他眼中深藏的灵魂。这对两个孩子来说是个令人困惑的时刻，但明日香决心将这些抛诸脑后。“真嗣，这边！”明日香首次在夜晚主动引领。“鬼屋？我、我不想被吓到。”真嗣紧张地回答。“来吧，胆小鬼，有伟大的明日香·兰格蕾·索西尔陪着你呢！” "你无需担心任何事。" 明日香自信地微笑着说。

"AH! SHINJI!" Asuka shrieked, grabbing onto Shinji's arm and burying herself into it. Shinji peered at the chainsaw wielding masked man that leapt out of nowhere. It was terrifying but Shinji found himself unusually calm. Maybe Asuka terrified meant he had be the strong one for her. Even though it had been her idea. "Is it gone?" Asuka asked frightfully. "No worries Asuka it's gone." Shinji confirmed. Asuka popped her head off of Shinji's arm but still gripped onto it for safety. She had no idea why she was acting like such a...a frighten little girl! This house didn't seem that scary on the outside but now she regretted coming in. She looked over at Shinji and found his calm, collected annoying. How dare he show her up! She was the great Asuka Lang...Abruptly a ferocious bat fell from the ceiling, eyes dark red with blood dripping off its gangs and headed straight to Asuka who let out another yell. Asuka felt two pair of strong arms wrapped around her body and she looked to find herself buried in Shinji's chest. "Don't worry Asuka" he said softly "I'll protect you" Asuka let out a content sigh before looking at him. Had he always been this strong? **"Yes...he has"** Asuka answered herself.  
"啊！真嗣！"明日香惊叫一声，紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂，将脸埋进去。真嗣望向那个突然冒出的手持电锯、戴着面具的男人，虽然恐怖，他却异常镇定。或许明日香的恐惧让他意识到，此刻他必须成为她的依靠。尽管提议来这里的是她。"它走了吗？"明日香颤抖着问。"没事了，明日香，它已经走了。"真嗣安慰道。明日香这才从真嗣手臂上抬起头，但依旧紧抓不放，寻求安全感。她不明白自己为何如此胆小，明明这房子外面看起来并不可怕，现在却后悔进来了。她瞥了一眼真嗣，见他依旧镇定自若，心中不禁生出一丝不悦。他怎么能在她面前表现得如此从容！她可是大名鼎鼎的明日香·兰格雷……突然，一只凶猛的蝙蝠从天花板猛地坠落，血红的眼睛中滴着血，直扑向明日香，她不禁再次尖叫。就在这时，两只有力的手臂紧紧抱住了她，她抬头一看，发现自己正依偎在真嗣的胸前。“别担心，明日香，”他温柔地说，“我会保护你的。”明日香安心地叹了口气，抬头凝视着他。他原来一直这么强壮吗？“是的...他一直如此，”明日香心中暗想。

Asuka's one confession finally broke the dam she had built up. Who was she kidding? She did want him to notice her. She did want to him to protect her. She did want to be closer to him. And yes Asuka Langely Sohryu wanted to be loved by Shinji Ikari. Every since she met him. It was like they connected at once but she wouldn't admit it. She would always deny it due to fear or maybe some kind of defense mechanism but this night lowered how defenses, so the joyful Shinji really had. How jealous she was at the idea of losing him to another and now, how he would always protect her. Asuka could finally admit to herself that she loved Shinji. This night had opened her eyes and she was tired of running.  
明日香的这次坦白终于冲破了她的心防。她一直在自欺欺人吗？她确实渴望他的关注，确实希望得到他的保护，确实想与他更加亲近。没错，从遇见他的那一刻起，惣流·明日香·兰格雷就渴望得到碇真嗣的爱。他们似乎一见面就心有灵犀，但她始终不愿承认，总是出于恐惧或某种自我保护而否认。然而这个夜晚，她的防线被削弱了，那个快乐的真嗣真的做到了。她对可能失去他给另一个人的想法感到多么嫉妒，而现在，他将会永远守护她。明日香终于能够向自己坦白，她爱着真嗣。这个夜晚让她看清了真相，她厌倦了逃避。

So gently, and with a little fear in her step, Asuka placed her hands on his chest, feeling his race heart beat under her fingers. Why was he nervous? Because of the house or that she was so close to him? Asuka could smell a scent that can be only described as Shinji. A scent that eased her mind and brought her peaceful dreams. A scent she wanted to claim as her own. So slowly she traced her fingers up his chest.  
阿苏卡轻柔地，带着些许胆怯，将手放在他的胸膛上，感受着指尖下他急速的心跳。他为何如此紧张？是因为这所房子，还是因为她与他如此贴近？阿苏卡嗅到了一种独属于真嗣的气息。这气息让她心神安宁，引领她进入平和的梦境。她渴望将这气息占为己有。于是，她缓缓地用手指沿着他的胸膛轻抚而上。

Shinji couldn't breath when he felt Asuka place her hands on his chest. He was amazed he had even wrapped his arms around her. Shinji had been in love with the girl he held for so long, since the moment they met. He just felt like she was the one. But she didn't like weak spineless boys. She loved Kaji but for all her torments, all her torture, Shinji would keep trying to show her how he felt for her. Cooking her breakfast, going with her anywhere she wanted. Even letting her take over his bed whenever she slept walked into his room. He wanted Asuka. She was confident, smart and beautiful. And once in a while, you could her true self peeking under the layers of iron walls she created. Shinji could feel shivers down his spine as Asuka's fingers began walking up his chest, up his neck and finally around his neck, pulling him ever so lightly to Asuka.  
当明日香将双手放在真嗣胸前时，他几乎窒息。他惊讶于自己竟能拥抱她。自相遇那一刻起，真嗣就深爱着这个女孩，坚信她就是命中注定的人。然而，她不喜欢软弱无骨的男孩，她爱的是加持。尽管她百般折磨，真嗣仍不断尝试表达自己的情感：为她准备早餐，陪她去任何地方，甚至在她梦游进他房间时，让她占据他的床。真嗣渴望得到明日香，她自信、聪明且美丽，偶尔，你能透过她筑起的坚硬外壳，窥见她真实的一面。 真嗣感到一阵寒意袭来，明日香的指尖从他的胸口缓缓攀上脖颈，最终轻柔地环住他的脖子，将他微微拉向自己。

"Shinji..." Asuka whispered. Shinji could just reply dumbfounded "Yes Asuka? Sky meet Steel and for once Shinji wasn't sure what was going to happen. "I want to tell you something Shinji..." Asuka inched closer. "What?" "I...I can't say it...it's hard" "Then show me Asuka. Show me what you can't say" Asuka was just inches away and Shinji found himself eagerly awaiting what the red head had to say. Like he always did. "Shinji...I...lo..."  
真嗣..." 明日香轻声唤道。真嗣愣住了，只能结巴地回应：“怎么了，明日香？天空与钢铁的邂逅，这次，真嗣心中无从预料。"我有些话想对你说，真嗣..." 明日香缓缓靠近。"什么话？" "我...我说不出口...太难了" "那就用行动告诉我，明日香。让我看到你难以启齿的情感" 明日香近在咫尺，真嗣发现自己急切地期待着这位红发少女的告白。一如既往。"真嗣...我...爱...

"BOO!" shouted the manic from earlier. The spell was broken "DAMNIT!" Asuka shouted, smashing her fist into the man's mask, sending him sprawling to the floor. Shinji was dumbfounded before he remembered they were still in the haunted house. He looked at Asuka's motionless figure, unsure what just happened but desperately wanted to confirm it. "Asuka..." he managed to get out but Asuka simply took off and ran outside the house. "Asuka!" Shinji quickly chased after him. After all this time, he was not going to lose her again. Not when something happened, not when something between them had been so close. He would not let her shut herself off again.  
"BOO!" 之前那个狂人突然大喊。咒语随之解除，"可恶！" 明日香怒吼着，一拳打在那人的面具上，使其摔倒在地。真嗣一时愣住，随即意识到他们仍在鬼屋中。他望向明日香静止的身影，不明所以却急切地想要确认。"明日香……" 他艰难地开口，然而明日香已经跑出了屋子。"明日香！" 真嗣立刻追了出去。经历了这么多，他绝不允许再次失去她，尤其是在他们之间关系如此微妙的时候。他决不允许她再次自我封闭。

---

"Damnit" Asuka cried, her iron walls raising higher than ever around her fearful heart. "This was a bad idea, a bad idea. Baka Asuka! What were you thinking? You and Shinji?" She laughed hollowly "Worst idea ever. Worst mistake! He doesn't like you like that! He would've made the first move, not you!" She had let all her emotions out but they were ruined. Now she couldn't stop them. She never felt so weak, so stupid before.  
"该死！" 明日香哭喊着，心中的防线比以往任何时候都更加坚固，紧紧守护着她那颗充满恐惧的心。"真是糟糕透顶的主意，我真是傻到家了！我和真嗣，这算什么？" 她自嘲地笑了笑，"简直是史上最烂的主意，最大的错误！他根本就不喜欢你到那种程度！如果他真的有意，早就行动了，怎么会轮到你来？" 她已将所有情感倾泻而出，却只换来一片狼藉。如今，她无法控制这些情感，从未感到如此无力，如此愚蠢。

Asuka raced into the elevator of the apartment and pressed the button as many times as she could, she didn't want Shinji catching up to her. She only fell to her knees when the doors closed. "I can't say how I feel...It's too hard. There's too much to lose." She cried to herself. The elevator slowed to a stop but Asuka made no effort to get out. "just one minute. One minute." Asuka told herself  
明日香冲进公寓电梯，疯狂地按着按钮，生怕真嗣追上来。直到电梯门合上，她才颓然跪下。“我无法说出我的感受...太难了。要失去的太多了。”她独自泪流。电梯慢慢停稳，但明日香并未起身离开。“就一分钟。给我一分钟。”她对自己喃喃自语。

"Damn" Shinji growled as the elevators closed just before he could get there. If Asuka ever got back to the apartment before he told her, she would shut herself off forever. Something was going on and even if Asuka didn't like him, even if she was thinking of someone, he couldn't hide these feelings anymore! Shinji made for the stairs and raced up them, determined to say what he wanted to say for the longest time.  
"该死！" 真嗣低吼一声，眼看着电梯门在他赶到前无情地关闭。如果明日香在他开口之前回到公寓，她恐怕会彻底将自己封闭起来。显然有什么事情正在发生，尽管明日香对他没有好感，尽管她心中可能另有所属，但真嗣再也抑制不住自己的情感了！他转身冲向楼梯，疾步向上，决心要倾吐那积压已久的心声。

Asuka looked outside the door of their apartment. Their home. With a shaky hand, Asuka softly nodded on the door. "This had been a bad idea Misato." she muttered under her breath. "Asuka" Asuka could feel her body tense up as she slowly turned around to the panting figure of Shinji just behind her. She quickly wiped her eyes and willed her face to slip back into her mask "What do you want baka Shinji?" Shinji paused. He would have only one chance before the door open and she locked herself in her room. One chance to get this right. "I...I want to tell you something" He started slowly, getting closer and closer to her. She could see she was fighting something, her mask of scowling and indifference was there was but only in pieces. "But...I can't say it. It's hard" Shinji was just in front of her and Asuka's eyes widen at the distance between them. She had to know. No more games. She had to put up or shut up. She could live with any answer but she couldn't live without one. "Why don't you show me then Shinji? Show me what you can't say."  
明日香望向公寓的门外，那是他们的家。她颤抖着手，轻轻地在门上点了点头，低声自语：“美里，这主意真糟。”听到身后真嗣气喘吁吁地叫她，“明日香”，她感到身体一紧，缓缓转过身。她迅速擦干眼泪，努力让表情恢复到平时的冷漠，问道：“你有什么事，笨蛋真嗣？”真嗣顿了顿，他只有一次机会，在门打开前，在她把自己锁进房间前，只有一次机会把话说对。“我……我想告诉你一些事。”他慢慢靠近，她能看出他在挣扎，她那副皱眉和冷漠的面具虽在，却已支离破碎。“但是……我无法说出口。” “这确实很难。”真嗣就在她眼前，明日香因他们之间的距离而瞪大了眼睛。她迫切需要知道答案。不再有任何游戏。她必须做出选择或保持沉默。任何结果她都能承受，但没有答案她无法继续生活。“那么，真嗣，你为什么不向我展示呢？展示那些你难以启齿的。”"

And he did. Running his fingers through her hair, Shinji softly kissed Asuka. Asuka felt waves of electricity flow through her body and finally the iron walls fell. She wanted more. She was being greedy but this was her Shinji! Asuka quickly wrapped her arms around his neck and deepen the kiss, even taking a little nibble on his lips. Shinji eyes widen before running his hands wildly through her red, silky hair. Shinji pinned Asuka against the door but before Asuka could fight back, his hands running themselves down her body, each gentle stroke paralyzing her with happiness and longing.  
他确实这么做了。手指轻抚她的秀发，真嗣温柔地吻上了明日香。明日香感到一股电流涌遍全身，那坚不可摧的心墙终于崩塌。她渴望更多，虽显贪婪，但这是她的真嗣！明日香迅速搂紧他的颈项，加深了这个吻，还轻咬了他的唇。真嗣的眼睛睁大，双手狂乱地穿梭在她那红色、丝滑的秀发中。他将明日香按在门上，未等她反抗，他的手已顺着她的身体温柔滑下，每一次抚摸都让她因幸福和渴望而动弹不得。

Both the teens heard the lock creak and Asuka pushed Shinji as far away as possible. "Oh, did you kids have..." Misato didn't finish as Asuka bolted for her room leaving Shinji outside. "My...that was different. Come on in Shinji." "Yeah" Shinji replied dejected. He had gone too far. Shinji let out a sigh as he plopped on the couch. "Misato, come here a moment." Asuka called out from her room. Shinji panicked. Was she about tease him for being a bad kisser? Was she going ask for him to be kicked out? Why didn't he think this through!?  
两个少年听到门锁吱嘎作响，明日香猛地将真嗣推开。“哦，你们俩刚才……” 美里话音未落，明日香已奔回自己房间，留下真嗣在外面。“这……真是出乎意料。进来吧，真嗣。” “嗯。” 真嗣沮丧地应声。他意识到自己做得太过分了。真嗣叹了口气，瘫坐在沙发上。“美里，过来一下。” 明日香从房间里喊道。真嗣心慌意乱，她是要嘲笑他吻技差吗？还是要他离开？他怎么就没想清楚呢！

`Misato disappeared into Asuka's room for second before returning with a serious look on her face. "Misato? W-what's up?" Shinji asked fearfully. "I have to go check on something. I'll be right back" Misato said impassively. And she did just that, headed straight into her room. Shinji grew nervous when he heard Asuka's door slide open and her footsteps approaching. She took a seat right next to him on the couch but he hadn't dared look at her though he could see from the corner of his eyes that she undid the ponytails and now her long hair flowed down the cheer outfit. Before he could even mention "I'm sorry" Asuka gave him a sharp warning. "I don't even want to hear the words I'm sorry. I don't want to hear anything except the answer to my question, understand?" Shinji shakily nodded. "Now baka. How do you honestly feel about me...exactly?"  
美里短暂地进入明日香的房间，随即带着严肃的神情返回。"美里？出...出什么事了？" 真嗣胆怯地问。"我得去确认一些事情。马上回来。" 美里语气平静。她说到做到，径直回到自己房间。真嗣听到明日香的房门滑动，脚步声逼近，心中不禁紧张。明日香在他身旁的沙发坐下，他却不敢直视，只是从眼角瞥见她解开了发辫，长发披散在啦啦队服上。他还没来得及道歉，明日香便厉声警告："我不想听'对不起'。除了我问题的答案，我不想听任何话，懂了吗？" 真嗣颤抖着点了点头。 说真的，你现在对我到底是什么感觉？"

Shinji was confused but decided to go with it. "Asuka...I think you are the most beautiful, smartest, most courageous girl ever. I'm amazed at your strength, your charisma, your beauty. I find myself doing anything just to be next to you even if you just tease me or even shout at me. You look beautiful because you make the clothes look good, not the other way around. Asuka...I love you" Shinji felt slightly better but was worried what the red head would say. "Shinji, face me." Shinji slowly turned to Asuka, her face expressionless but her eyes twinkling with joy. "baka Shinji" she whispered before wrapping her arms around once more and giving him a kiss. "I love you too Shinji." "Re-Really? But Why?" Shinji cringed but had to know why. This was Asuka! How could she love him?  
真嗣虽然困惑，却决定顺其自然。"明日香...在我心中，你是世上最美丽、最聪慧、最勇敢的女孩。你的力量、魅力和美貌令我折服。我愿意为你做任何事，只为能留在你身边，哪怕你只是戏弄我，甚至对我发火。是你让衣服显得美丽，而非衣服衬托了你。明日香...我爱你。"真嗣心情稍有好转，却担心红发少女的反应。"真嗣，看着我。"他缓缓转向明日香，她面无表情，眼中却闪烁着喜悦。"傻瓜真嗣"她轻声说着，再次拥抱他并吻了他。"我也爱你，真嗣。""真...真的吗？可为什么？"真嗣心中一紧，却迫切想知道答案。这可是明日香啊！她怎么会爱上他呢？

"Because you're kind. You're always there for me. You put up with me. You call me beautiful and I actually feel like I am when you say it because I know you mean it. You always protect me and stood by me. And you really are handsome. You're my baka, so get use to it" Asuka said with a smile. Shinji grinned as Asuka pecked his lips once more. "Now it's late. Tomorrow, we'll let everyone know the news." "The news?" Shinji asked confused. Asuka flashed him a bright smile "That we're dating. I told you, you're my baka and only mine. I tend to get greedy with my possessions." Shinji just smiled "I wouldn't have it any other way."  
因为你心地善良。你始终陪伴在我身边，包容我的一切。你称赞我美丽，而你的话语让我真的感觉自己很美，因为我知道你是发自内心的。你总是守护着我，坚定地站在我这边。而且，你确实很帅气。你是我的傻瓜，所以就习惯吧。" 明日香带着微笑说道。真嗣笑了笑，明日香再次轻吻了他的唇。"现在夜已深。明天，我们会向大家宣布那个消息。" "什么消息？" 真嗣有些困惑。明日香对他展露明媚的笑容，"就是我们正在交往的消息。我早说过，你是我的傻瓜，只属于我。我对属于自己的东西总是很执着。" 真嗣只是微笑回应，"我别无他求。
