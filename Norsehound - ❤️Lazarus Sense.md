拉撒路感应

**I.**

Shinji ceased ruminating when a flash of vivid red crossed his vision, and his feet crunched to a stop. Slowly, shaking, his hand reached down for the A10 NERV connectors that were discarded on the ground. He examined them before pulling a loose strand of red hair from the clip.  
当一抹鲜亮的红色掠过视线时，真嗣停止了沉思，脚步嘎吱作响地停了下来。他缓缓地，颤抖着，伸手去捡起地上被丢弃的 A10 NERV 连接器。他检查了一番，然后从夹子上扯下一根松散的红发。

His eyes widened as he lowered the connectors and looked at the ruined building he stood beside. How could this be here? It seemed impossible. "She… she isn't with Hikari?"  
他的眼睛睁大了，他放下连接器，看着他身旁那座破败的建筑。这怎么可能在这里？这似乎是不可能的。“她……她没有和光在一起吗？”

He faced the building. He had to find out if she was in there. His curiosity and… and sense of concern demanded that he go in there. Clutching the connectors, he trudged up the ruined path into the house.  
他面对着那座建筑。他必须查明她是否在里面。他的好奇心和……以及关切感驱使他进入那里。紧握着连接器，他艰难地沿着破损的小径走进了房子。

He passed through what was once a living room and down a hallway. He briefly wondered who lived here, was it a family? Someone alone? So much of the city had been destroyed following Ayanami's… action. What could…  
他穿过曾经是客厅的地方，沿着一条走廊前行。他短暂地想知道这里曾经住着谁，是一个家庭吗？还是某个人独自居住？在绫波的……行动之后，城市的大部分已被摧毁。这可能……

He stopped when he looked down the hall. At the end of it, through a door frame, a clawfoot tub sat on the far end. He could see a milk white form within.  
他停下脚步，望向走廊尽头。透过门框，远处摆放着一个爪足浴缸，里面隐约可见一个乳白色的身影。

Swallowing nervously, he approached the bathtub. Anticipation and anxiousness churned in his gut as he imagined what he would find.  
他紧张地咽了咽口水，向浴缸走去。期待与焦虑在腹中翻腾，想象着即将揭晓的秘密。

He stopped beside the tub.  
他在浴缸旁停了下来。

It was Asuka. 是明日香。

Her clothes had been neatly folded on the chair beside the tub, signaling her intention. She rested there motionless except as her chest rose and fell with steady breathing.  
她的衣物整齐地叠放在浴缸旁的椅子上，表明了她的意图。她静静地躺在那里，除了随着平稳的呼吸胸口起伏外，一动不动。

Shinji blinked as he realized he was seeing her nudity. He couldn't tear his eyes away from her breasts, her torso, her hips. The image burned itself into his memory as he took what he wanted.  
意识到自己正目睹她的裸体，真嗣眨了眨眼。他的目光无法从她的胸部、躯干、臀部移开。这画面深深烙印在他的记忆中，他索取了自己想要的。

Then his eyes focused on her face. Her cheeks were sunken in from malnourishment. Her once vibrant, defiant eyes were now lifeless tiles staring blankly into the sky, unmoving. Her lips were cracked and dry.  
随后，他的目光聚焦在她的脸上。她的双颊因营养不良而凹陷。曾经充满活力、倔强的双眼，如今已是无神的瓦片，空洞地凝望着天空，一动不动。她的嘴唇干裂。

With horror Shinji realized that Asuka had been transformed into a doll. Her volatile personality was completely inverted. She had become the very thing she despised.  
惊恐中，真嗣意识到明日香已被变成了一个玩偶。她那易变的性格彻底反转。她变成了自己最憎恶的东西。

Shinji did not know how to handle this. At all.  
真嗣完全不知道该如何应对这种情况。一点头绪都没有。

He spun and took fleeing steps from the house but tripped. His knee skidded as he collided with the ruined floor. He clutched it and rolled- his eyes focused again on Asuka's concluded expression.  
他转身逃离屋子，却绊了一跤。膝盖在破败的地板上擦伤，他捂住膝盖，翻滚着——目光再次聚焦在明日香那已成定局的表情上。

How long would she remain in that tub? Did anyone know she was here?  
她还要在浴缸里待多久？有人知道她在这里吗？

_What if nobody did? She would die here.  
如果没人知道呢？她会死在这里。_

_The sun and the moon would cycle overhead, not caring one whit that Asuka Langley Soryu had expired. Her skin would decay. The bugs and animals would have their way, tearing Asuka Langley Soryu apart.  
太阳和月亮依旧在天空中循环往复，对惣流·明日香·兰格雷的逝去毫不在意。她的肌肤将逐渐腐烂，虫蚁和动物将肆意破坏，将惣流·明日香·兰格雷撕扯得支离破碎。_

_She would never again see the lights of the city. She would never hear words from others. She would never see a movie, enjoy a hot meal, or hold hands with anyone. She would never love, or be loved.  
她再也看不到城市的灯火，再也听不到他人的话语。她再也看不到电影，享受不到热腾腾的饭菜，或是与任何人牵手。她再也无法去爱，或是被爱。_

Shinji stared and remembered another time he had looked into her future to see her death, at the volcano of Mount Asama. Instead of molten fire though, her death here would be quiet indifference.  
真嗣凝视着，回忆起另一次他预见她的死亡，那是在浅间山的火山口。然而，与那次熔岩烈焰不同，她在这里的死亡将是无声的冷漠。

His nature of fleeing from pain battled his sense of righteousness and affection for her. He couldn't handle what Asuka had become; but he was her only hope for a continued existence.  
他逃避痛苦的本性与对她的正义感和情感交战。他无法面对明日香变成的样子；但他是她继续存在的唯一希望。

He remembered her defiant look at sunset, angrily chewing her sandwich and sipping the cola. It was then, perhaps, that his crush transformed into something more substantive.  
他记得她在夕阳下倔强的表情，气愤地嚼着三明治，啜饮着可乐。或许就在那时，他对她的迷恋转变成了更实质的东西。

He would not abandon her in that bathtub to die.  
他不会将她留在浴缸中任其死去。

The telephone in the house had no receiver, so he couldn't just call for help. His sojourn this morning also happened without his cell phone. He had wanted solitude to clear his mind.  
屋内的电话没有听筒，他无法直接求救。今早的逗留也恰巧没带手机。他本想独处以清心绪。

He had crossed kilometers of destroyed cityscape north to get away from Lake Ashi. He would have to cross it again to get Asuka to any kind of care.  
他曾穿越北方被毁城市的数公里废墟，以远离芦之湖。为了将明日香送往任何形式的救治，他必须再次穿越这片废墟。

It was down to him.  
一切都落在了他身上。

And he couldn't leave Asuka alone. Something could happen to her while he was gone.  
他不能丢下明日香一个人。他不在的时候，她可能会出事。

He had sat conflicted beside the tub as he tried to decide what to do. He hugged his legs while he wrestled with indecision. He was pretty sure he lacked the medical knowledge to treat Asuka immediately, but to do nothing meant she would die. Only now she'd die in front of him.  
他坐在浴缸旁，内心矛盾，试图决定该怎么做。他抱着双腿，与犹豫不决作斗争。他很确定自己缺乏立即治疗明日香的医疗知识，但什么都不做意味着她会死去。现在，她将在他面前死去。

As he sat he was also aware that the battle with unit 03 was repeating all over again. Except instead of unit 03 throttling him, death was throttling Asuka. He had refused to kill Toji but didn't know how to help, so he did nothing.  
当他坐下时，他意识到与 03 号机体的战斗再次重演。只是这次，不是 03 号机体扼住他的喉咙，而是死亡扼住了明日香的喉咙。他拒绝杀死东治，却不知道如何施以援手，于是他什么也没做。

Of course he thought of what happened after-  
当然，他想到了之后发生的事情——

_Shinji. 真嗣。_

_I can't do anything but just water here. But there is something you, and only you, can do.  
我除了在这里浇水什么也做不了。但有一件事，只有你能做。_

Shinji raised his head to look at Asuka.  
真嗣抬起头，望向明日香。

_Nobody is forcing you. Think for yourself, and decide for yourself, what you have to do for yourself now.  
没有人强迫你。自己思考，自己决定，现在为了自己必须做什么。_

Shinji, slowly, got to his feet. He stared down at Asuka's face.  
真嗣缓缓站起身，低头凝视着明日香的脸庞。

_…you know, so you don't have any regrets.  
…你知道的，这样你就不会有任何遗憾了。_

Shinji's fists clenched as he made up his mind. He may not know what to do specifically, but he needed to do something. He'd figure out the rest as he went.  
真嗣握紧了拳头，下定了决心。他可能还不清楚具体该做什么，但他必须采取行动。他会边做边想。

---

He maneuvered the cup close to her face. She didn't respond, lifeless eyes still staring into the air above the tub. Shinji swallowed nervously as he landed the tip of the glass against her lips and gently poured.  
他将杯子移到她脸旁。她没有反应，无神的眼睛依旧凝视着浴缸上方的空气。真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，将玻璃杯的边缘轻触到她的唇上，缓缓倾倒。

She gagged and coughed, turning her head a little in resistance.  
她呛得咳嗽起来，略微转头以示抗拒。

"Asuka, please drink this." Shinji requested.  
“明日香，请喝下这个。” 真嗣请求道。

"W..h..y…" “为…什…么…”

The word escaped her lips in a whisper and Shinji blinked in astonishment. "D-don't you want to live?" He asked.  
那句话从她唇间低声溜出，令真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼。“你难道不想活下去吗？”他问道。

Her plastic-like eyes stared above him, her breath the only thing he heard.  
她那塑料般的眼神凝视着上方，他只能听见她的呼吸声。

Shinji's selfishness spoke with the form of the Asuka in his mind. She used his mouth to berate the real Asuka.  
真嗣心中的自私以明日香的形象出现，借他的口斥责着真正的明日香。

"Dummy!" He barked at her suddenly, "I won't let you go! You're stronger than this, Asuka!"  
"傻瓜！" 他突然对她吼道，"我不会让你走的！你比这更坚强，明日香！"

He perceived the small kick she took, because she blinked and shifted a little. When Shinji tried giving her water again she swallowed what he had to offer.  
他察觉到她轻微的踢动，因为她眨了眨眼，稍微动了动。当真嗣再次尝试给她喂水时，她咽下了他递来的水。

He moved off. His next task was to get her ready for transport. This meant getting her dressed, or trying to. Moving through the ruins of the house he looked for what he could use. The remaining bedroom here had a roof, a bed with a collapsed leg, and a sheet. It was scratchy and debris-covered from whatever destroyed the house, but it would keep her warm after he shook it out.  
他离开了。接下来的任务是让她准备好运输。这意味着要给她穿衣服，或者尝试这样做。他在房屋的废墟中穿行，寻找可用之物。剩下的卧室这里还有屋顶，一张床腿已经塌陷的床，以及一张床单。床单粗糙，上面覆盖着房屋被毁时留下的碎屑，但抖干净后，它还能让她保暖。

He stood next to the tub and prepared himself to lift her. His eyes once again danced over her body in spite of himself. He grunted and pushed himself through, arms going around her back and under her knees. He breathed, then heaved.  
他站在浴缸旁，准备将她抱起。尽管努力克制，他的目光还是不由自主地再次扫过她的身体。他低哼一声，强迫自己行动起来，双臂环过她的背部，托住她的膝弯。他深吸一口气，然后用力将她抱起。

He had never lifted anyone before. In spite of how emaciated her face appeared, she was still heavier than he anticipated. He took it slow to carry her across the broken floor to the bed.  
他从未抱过任何人。尽管她的面容显得消瘦，但她的体重还是超出了他的预期。他小心翼翼地抱着她，穿过破碎的地板，走向床边。

He got a bump of emotion as he carried her, though. Asuka left an abrasive legacy, but it felt nice to cradle her. Her breath against his chest, and holding the weight of her body would have been magical if it weren't such a dire situation.  
抱着她的时候，他感受到了一丝情感的波动。明日香留下的印象虽有些刺人，但此刻抱着她却感觉很好。她的呼吸轻拂他的胸膛，怀中她的重量，若非情况如此危急，本该是种美妙的体验。

_That is, if any of this meant anything with her,_ he thought.  
也就是说，如果这一切对她有任何意义的话，他思忖着。

The kiss came to mind as he gently landed Asuka on the bed, and eased her off of his arm. When he leaned up from the bed and looked at her his breath caught in his throat.  
当他轻轻地将明日香放在床上，并从手臂上移开她时，那个吻浮现在脑海中。当他从床边起身，凝视着她时，他的呼吸在喉咙里停滞了。

Her eyes were staring at him. Their pupils locked.  
她的眼睛正盯着他。他们的瞳孔紧紧锁定。

Shinji hung in that long moment as he waited for something to happen. Her chest rose and fell, her breasts moving along with her skin.  
真嗣在那漫长的瞬间中悬着，等待着事情的发生。她的胸膛起伏，乳房随着肌肤移动。

Shinji blinked and then stepped sideways. Her eyes didn't follow.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，然后侧身一步。她的目光并未追随。

Sighing with disgust and disappointment he folded the blanket over her naked body, then walked back to the tub to recover her clothes. Realistically he could only think to get her shirt and underwear on… the blue skirt and vest seemed complicated. The bra was just extra work.  
带着厌恶和失望，他叹了口气，将毯子盖在她裸露的身体上，然后走回浴缸旁去取她的衣物。实际上，他只能想到给她穿上衬衫和内衣……那条蓝色裙子和背心看起来很复杂。胸罩只是额外的工作。

He took a moment to consider her underwear. He knew it was every boy's fantasy to get a hold of a pair; to smell them and do other things he couldn't understand. He was about to push through this too, turning to go back to her, when he realized what he was feeling just then.  
他停顿了一下，思索着她的内衣。他知道，对每个男孩来说，拿到一条这样的内衣，闻一闻，甚至做些他还不甚明了的事情，都是一种幻想。他正要克服这种冲动，转身回去找她，却突然意识到自己那一刻的感受。

Her vulnerability. 她的脆弱。

It struck him because he hadn't considered Asuka being _vulnerable_ before- not even when he held this same pair of underwear to wash them! But here, now, this was the only screen to protect her modesty. And Shinji had power over it. Over her.  
这让他震惊，因为他从未想过明日香会显得脆弱——即使在他拿着同一条内裤去洗的时候也没有！但此刻，这成了唯一保护她端庄的屏障。而真嗣掌握着这个权力，掌握着她。

He stepped into the bedroom and looked at her. She was helpless now, open. A doll to play with. He could do anything he wanted and she wouldn't care, or react. Nobody would know. He had fantasies about this very moment.  
他走进卧室，看着她。此刻的她无助而敞开，像一个任人摆布的玩偶。他可以为所欲为，而她不会在意，也不会有任何反应。无人会知晓。他曾幻想过这一刻。

Holding her underwear he looked at her face. Her eyes weren't looking at him now, but the lighting and the angle of her head made it impossible to miss how impoverished she was looking.  
他拿着她的内裤，凝视着她的脸。她的目光并未投向他，但光线和她的头部角度让人无法忽视她那副穷困潦倒的模样。

He gripped her underwear tighter. Seeing her this way made it easier to knock away his lust, and refocus on helping her. Holding on to that determination he closed on her with the garment, hooked her feet through the holes, and started to slide it up her legs. "Sorry." He grunted as he got to her hips and shoved the thing into place.  
他紧握着她的内裤，看到她这般模样，更容易驱散自己的欲望，转而专注于帮助她。他坚定地拿着衣物靠近她，将她的脚穿过裤腿，开始向上提拉。“抱歉。”当他到达她的臀部时，他咕哝着将内裤推到位。

He didn't notice, as he worked to get the garment on, that her eyes lazily drifted to focus on him. Once her underwear was on she blinked slowly and continued her vacant stare. She was still staring ahead as Shinji pushed her into a sitting position while he sat behind her. Then he got her shirt on, and closed it up with buttons from behind.  
他并未察觉，在努力帮她穿上衣物时，她的目光慵懒地飘向他。穿上内衣后，她缓缓眨了眨眼，继续茫然地凝视前方。当碇真嗣将她推成坐姿，自己坐在她身后时，她依旧目光空洞。接着，他帮她穿上衬衫，从背后一颗颗扣上纽扣。

Once he was done he sat for a moment to catch his breath with her comatose form leaning against him. His hands rested on her thighs he exhaled gently, taking in the scent of her sweat and hair as he breathed. Not seeing her face it was easy to recast this scene as if it was in Misato's apartment, In an intimate moment that could not have been.  
一切完成后，他坐下稍作休息，她的昏迷身躯倚靠在他身上。他的手搭在她的大腿上，轻柔地呼出一口气，呼吸间满是她汗水与发丝的气息。看不到她的脸，这场景仿佛能轻易地被重塑成在美里公寓中的情景，一个不可能存在的亲密时刻。

"I wish…" he said to her, but stopped there. She would have hated this. Hated him. The only reason he was doing this was because he couldn't just stand by and watch her die.  
“我真希望…”他对她开口，却戛然而止。她会厌恶这一切，厌恶他。他之所以这么做，只是因为他无法袖手旁观，眼睁睁看着她死去。

Even if… even if he wanted to _matter_ to her.  
即便…即便他想要在她心中占有一席之地。

He got up supporting her and gently leaned her down to the bed. Then he sat in her lap and pulled her up by her arms, roping them over his shoulders once she was against his back. Then he lifted her by the bottoms of her thighs in a typical back carry. Her head was nestled beside his, and the A10 clips he held with his teeth.  
他起身扶着她，轻柔地将她放倒在床上。随后，他坐在她的膝上，拉着她的手臂，让她靠在自己背上，将她的双臂环过自己的肩膀。接着，他以典型的背负方式托起她的大腿底部。她的头紧贴着他的，而他则用牙齿咬着 A10 的夹子。

"Come on Asuka, let's get you some help." He said. Slowly he carried his copilot out of the ruins of that house, and started back towards Tokyo 3.  
“来吧，明日香，我们去找点帮助。”他说道。他缓缓地背着他的副驾驶员，从那栋房子的废墟中走出，开始向第三新东京市返回。

When Section Two arrived two hours later They changed the nature of her case to a kidnapping. The trail they assumed wouldn't change had gone cold.  
当第二部门两小时后到达时，他们将她的案件性质改为绑架。他们原以为不会改变的线索已经变冷。

_A/N: This is the same premise as my earlier Panacea, but even when I wrote that, I wanted to craft a tale where Shinji_ personally _came to assist Asuka. Panacea sort of cheats by getting the Horaki sisters involved. It works, but I wanted this to be more personal to Shinji. So, Lazarus Sense. The only regret is that because of the location and time frame, Shinji doesn't have the space to nurse her back to health himself._  
作者注：这个前提与我之前的《万灵药》相同，但即便在写那篇时，我就想构思一个故事，让真嗣亲自来帮助明日香。《万灵药》通过引入堀木姐妹参与来解决问题，虽然有效，但我希望这个故事对真嗣来说更个人化。因此，有了《拉撒路感应》。唯一的遗憾是由于地点和时间框架，真嗣没有空间亲自照顾她恢复健康。

_The trigger for this event is sending Shinji to wander Tokyo-3 earlier in the day, and send him away from Lake Ashi to run into Asuka before Section 2 finds her. Had he stayed at Lake Ashi and departed in the evening, he would have met Kaworu and set off the pivotal events of the series. These events were averted.  
这一事件的触发点是让真嗣在当天早些时候在第三新东京市游荡，并让他远离芦之湖，在第二部门找到明日香之前与她相遇。如果他留在芦之湖并在晚上离开，他就会遇到渚薰，从而引发系列的关键事件。这些事件被避免了。_

**II.**

Tokyo-3 had been almost completely destroyed by Ayanami's… desperate attack. Only the suburbs to the east had survived. The smattering of buildings that curved north- old Hakone where he found Asuka- had been reduced to a blasted wasteland from the shockwave.  
第三新东京市几乎被绫波的绝望攻击彻底摧毁。只有东部的郊区幸存下来。那些向北蜿蜒的建筑群——他找到明日香的老箱根——已被冲击波夷为废墟。

Now he needed to find his way back to some measure of civilization in the ruins of the most advanced city in the world.  
现在，他需要在世界上最先进城市的废墟中找到一条通往文明的道路。

Shinji was on his way down one of the cracked streets, hoping to spot a working payphone he could use, or an intact building which might have power.  
真嗣正沿着一条裂开的街道前行，希望能找到一个能用的公用电话，或者一栋有电的完好建筑。

The blasted foundations didn't seem promising. There was almost nothing left in this area of town near where the school had once been.  
那破败的地基看起来毫无希望。这片靠近曾经学校的城区，几乎什么也没剩下。

The first stop he took was by a blasted out convenience store on the side of the road. The building seemed robust enough, and the entry had been pointed away from the site of the blast.  
他的第一站是路边一家被炸毁的便利店。建筑看起来足够坚固，入口也避开了爆炸点。

Shinji maneuvered gently with Asuka's weight on his back. He pushed through the downed doors and broken glass to find a spot that hadn't been ruined, in order to gently set his redhead down. The space behind the register was carpeted, also.  
真嗣小心翼翼地背着明日香前行。他穿过倒下的门和碎玻璃，寻找一个未被破坏的地方，以便轻轻放下他的红发伙伴。收银台后面的空间也铺着地毯。

He turned around and grunted as he bent his knees slowly. He felt carpet under his fingers and gently leaned back, hearing her bump against the cabinet wall.  
他转过身，慢慢屈膝时发出一声咕哝。手指触到地毯，他轻轻向后靠去，听见她撞上了橱柜壁。

He turned around then to look at her, dismayed still that her state was vacant and empty. "Asuka," he said to the doll, "I'm going to find us some water. Stay here."  
他再次转身看向她，仍为她那空洞无神的状态感到沮丧。“明日香，”他对玩偶说，“我要去找点水。你留在这里。”

She didn't even grunt, making Shinji's face keep a little frown. He got up and scoured the convenience store after verifying the phones were dead here, too.

What hadn't been destroyed in the blast had been picked over by looters. There was very little he could find in the store, but at least he did find things. Most of his concern was whether Asuka was too out of it to digest anything he did find. The result of his search produced a bag of chips and a couple of bags of nuts.  
爆炸中未被摧毁的东西已被劫掠者搜刮一空。他在店里能找到的东西寥寥无几，但至少还是找到了一些。他最担心的是明日香是否太过恍惚，以至于无法消化他找到的任何东西。他的搜寻结果是一袋薯片和几包坚果。

One find that gave him hope were protein drinks. Amazingly, though perhaps unsurprisingly, the looters had passed over the health and nutrition section of the refrigerator. He reached in and selected, of the three flavors, the banana and strawberry flavor protein shakes. Strawberries, he remembered, were a favorite of hers. Probably because they were red, like so much else about her.  
找到的蛋白饮料给了他一线希望。令人惊讶的是，也许并不意外，劫掠者们忽略了冰箱里的健康营养区。他伸手进去，从三种口味中选择了香蕉草莓味的蛋白奶昔。他记得，草莓是她的最爱。可能是因为它们是红色的，就像她身上的许多其他事物一样。

He came back to the doll to find she had shifted a little, rolling to her side a degree and collapsing against the inner wall of the cash register.  
他回到玩偶身边时，发现她已经稍微动了一下，侧身翻转了一点，然后无力地靠在了收银机内侧的墙上。

"Asuka." He said to her, "I have a protein drink. You need to have some of this to bring your strength up."  
"明日香。" 他对着她说，"我这里有蛋白饮料。你需要喝一些来恢复体力。"

Shinji worked to uncap the milky, slushy drink. He checked himself then, realizing she wasn't in a place to just take it from him. He would have to handle her again to make sure that she would drink it.  
真嗣努力拧开那瓶乳白色的冰沙饮料。他随即意识到，她现在无法直接从他手中接过饮料。他必须再次帮助她，确保她能喝到。

He set down the drink in reach and, sighing, put his hand at the back of her neck to move her head and help her drink. He looked down.  
他将饮料放在她触手可及的地方，叹了口气，将手放在她后颈，轻轻移动她的头部帮助她饮用。他低头看着。

Her eyes slid in their sockets to look at him, sending a spike of fear into his chest. But as he locked eyes with her it helped Shinji see Asuka. She was a person for this moment, not just a soulless doll.  
她的眼珠在眼眶中转动，看向他，一股恐惧直刺他的胸膛。但当他与她目光交汇时，这让真嗣看到了真实的明日香。她此刻是一个活生生的人，而非一具无魂的玩偶。

He swallowed. "Asuka," he said to her, "I need you to drink this, please."  
他咽了口唾沫，说道：“明日香，”他对她说，“请你喝下这个。”

He maneuvered the lip of the cup to her lips and tipped a little into her mouth. She responded by slowly closing her eyes and swallowing the liquid. "There…" Shinji breathed out gently. He patiently helped her drink until she grunted and turned her head. "Ok." He said. He considered the drink, then downed the rest himself and set the empty bottle on the counter.  
他将杯沿移至她唇边，轻轻倾斜，让一些液体流入她口中。她缓缓闭上眼睛，咽下了液体。“好了…”真嗣轻声喘息。他耐心地帮助她喝下，直到她哼了一声，转过头去。“可以了。”他说。他审视了一下那杯饮料，然后自己喝完了剩下的，将空瓶放在了柜台上。

Her eyes opened and rolled up at him again. He looked down at her, unsure of what to say at first. The words he finally chose were, "I'm going to make sure you get well, okay? Even if I have to take you to a hospital myself."  
她的眼睛睁开，又朝他翻了个白眼。他低头看着她，一开始不知道该说什么。最终，他选择的话语是：“我会确保你康复的，好吗？哪怕我得亲自带你去医院。”

She closed her eyes and rolled her head away from him again. A sigh passed out of her lips.  
她闭上眼睛，再次将头转向远离他的方向。一声叹息从她的唇间逸出。

He remained there next to her for a time. The smell of her sweat was strong; Shinji wondered then how long it had been since she bathed. It wasn't unpleasant, though, it just smelled of her. And after imagining what it was like for her to be gone, his nostrils were happy to be reminded of her presence in that way. He sighed.  
他继续在她身边待了一会儿。她身上的汗味很浓；那时，真嗣不禁好奇她有多久没洗澡了。但这并不令人反感，那只是她的味道。想象着她不在的情景后，他的鼻孔很高兴能以这种方式被提醒她的存在。他叹了口气。

"I'm… im glad I found you." He said, "all this time I thought you were at Hikari's place because… because you hated us." Bringing his knees up he uttered, "I wish things could go back to the way they were before. E-even... Even when you were yelling at me. At least then… then I could see you. Be in the same place with you. Just… be with you. That would make me happy, just to have that again."  
"我很高兴...终于找到了你。" 他说道，"这么久以来，我一直以为你在光的家，是因为...因为你讨厌我们。" 他抱起膝盖，喃喃自语，"真希望一切能回到从前。哪怕...哪怕你那时对我大吼大叫。至少那时候...那时候我还能见到你。能和你同处一室。只要...只要能再次和你在一起，我就心满意足了。

She grunted lightly through her mouth at him. Shinji looked at her to see if she would say or do more. She didn't, her eyes were still closed. She breathed through her nose and slightly agape lips.  
她轻哼一声，嘴角微动，向他示意。真嗣注视着她，期待她会有更多言语或动作。然而她没有，双眼依旧紧闭。她通过鼻孔和微微张开的嘴唇呼吸着。

Not sure what that had meant, Shinji just took it as coincidence. "I'm going to… use the bathroom, and then I'll be right back." Shinji said and stood up. "Don't go anywhere."  
不确定那意味着什么，真嗣只当是巧合。“我去趟洗手间，马上回来。”真嗣说着站起身来。“别走开。”

---

Asuka grunted once into his ear softly as he walked.  
阿苏卡轻轻地在他耳边哼了一声，他继续走着。

"Are you all right? Do we need to stop?" Shinji asked her, but Asuka didn't say anything more as he walked with her on his back.  
你还好吗？我们需要停下来吗？" 真嗣问她，但阿苏卡没有再说什么，他背着她继续前行。

It was still slow going, and Shinji had to navigate almost entirely by looking at the surrounding hills. Roadways were blocked by destroyed debris, and patches of ground looked rather treacherous to cross. He was headed east again, hoping to find a major roadway before turning south towards Misato's apartment. That area of the suburbs was still intact, he would be likely to find help for Asuka there.  
行进依旧缓慢，真嗣几乎完全依靠观察周围的山丘来导航。道路被毁坏的碎片堵塞，地面上的几处看起来相当危险，难以穿越。他再次向东行进，希望能找到一条主要道路，然后转向南前往美里公寓的方向。那片郊区仍然完好，他很可能会在那里为阿苏卡找到帮助。

It was still a ways to go though.  
尽管如此，还有一段路要走。

The trudging of his feet was the only sound heard for a while. He decided to break the silence. "S-so… things at Misato's place are… weird, now."  
他的脚步声是唯一能听到的声音，持续了一会儿。他决定打破沉默。“那个……现在在美里家的事情……变得很奇怪。”

When she didn't respond he went on. "Something strange is going on with Ayanami. She didn't remember me after… after all this. And… and Misato was strange too. She…she tried…"  
她没有回应，他便继续说道：“绫波有些不对劲。她……经历了这一切后，竟然不记得我了。而且……美里也很奇怪。她……她试图……”

Just steps. The clopping of his shoes echoed off the silent stones and destroyed walls of the once vibrant city. Shinji decided he didn't want to talk about that anymore.  
只是脚步声。他的鞋跟敲击在寂静的石板和残垣断壁上，回响在这座昔日繁华城市的废墟中。真嗣决定不再谈论这个话题。

"I… I wish you had been there. I couldn't figure out what was going on, but I know you would have. I… I feel lost… without you there. I know you don't care, but I miss you."  
我……我希望你当时在场。我搞不清楚发生了什么，但我知道你一定能明白。我……我感觉很迷茫……没有你在身边。我知道你不在乎，但我真的很想你。

She grunted again and shifted a little. "Are you hungry?" He asked her, "Do you need some water?"  
她又哼了一声，稍微动了动。“你饿了吗？”他问她，“需要喝水吗？”

She only breathed against his shoulder. He tried to find a place where he could set her down, but the surroundings were more broken and flattened buildings. He wondered if-  
她只是靠在他的肩上呼吸。他试图找到一个可以放下她的地方，但四周尽是破碎倒塌的建筑。他不禁思索，是否……

His lower back back felt damp. Weird, was it sweat? He didn't think that-  
他的后腰感觉湿漉漉的。奇怪，是汗吗？他觉得不像是——

He heard splattering behind him and turned. A trail of water had started to follow him. He wondered again how this could happen until he realized Asuka was emptying her bladder. He uttered a panicked sound and tried to find a spot to set her down.  
他听到身后有溅水声，转过身去。一道水迹开始跟随着他。他再次疑惑这是怎么发生的，直到意识到明日香正在小便。他发出一声惊慌的叫声，试图找个地方把她放下。

---

Asuka's underwear was soaked, and the lower back half of Shinji's over and undershirts were damp. His pants fared better, at least. As the sun beat down on the ruins, a shirtless Shinji was looking around the ruins for something dry to dress both of them into. He couldn't find anything.  
明日香的内裤湿透了，真嗣的衬衫后半部分也变得潮湿。至少他的裤子还好。阳光炙烤着废墟，赤膊的真嗣在废墟中四处寻找干燥的衣物来给两人换上。但他什么也没找到。

He sighed as he stood beside where he landed her. The low wall they stood beside must have been a foundation before the blast.  
他叹了口气，站在放下她的地方旁边。他们所站的低矮墙壁，在爆炸前一定是某个建筑的地基。

Shinji was feeling increasingly restricted- he didn't want Asuka to wear soiled underwear for the rest of their journey. He had an idea, but he resisted. It seemed stupid and… maybe unsanitary? He knew she would hate it, and probably hit him if she weren't in her current state. But he didn't want her wearing urine soaked clothing.  
真嗣感到越来越受限——他不想让明日香在余下的旅程中穿着脏内衣。他有个主意，但又抗拒了。这似乎很愚蠢，而且……可能不卫生？他知道她会讨厌这个主意，如果不是她现在这种状态，她可能会打他。但他不想让她穿着浸满尿液的衣物。

With no other option he crouched down beside her. "Asuka, I can't find anything else for you to wear. So… I'm going to give you…" he sighed and shook his head. "I'm going to give you my underwear. Is that okay?"  
在没有其他选择的情况下，他蹲在她旁边。“明日香，我找不到其他可以给你穿的东西。所以……我要给你……”他叹了口气，摇了摇头。“我要给你我的内裤。这样可以吗？”

Asuka continued to stare blankly ahead.  
明日香继续茫然地盯着前方。

"Right." He said. Casting about with one more look to see if anyone was around, Shinji stepped across the rubble to get some distance, but not travel too far.  
"好的。" 他说道。环顾四周确认无人后，真嗣跨过瓦砾，保持一定距离，但又不至于走得太远。

What he didn't know was that he hadn't gone far enough. Her eyes rolled to look at him, and she watched him pull off his pants, then his briefs. The only other time she saw that much skin on Ikari was when she spied on him while he donned her plugsuit in the beginning.  
他不知道的是，他并没有走远。她的眼睛转动着看向他，目睹他脱下裤子，接着是内裤。她上一次看到碇真嗣露出这么多肌肤，还是在最初时偷窥他穿上她的插入栓服的时候。

Her eyes unfocused and drifted to the ground. The spark of her spirit tried to overcome the heaviness of everything. She was sore, numb, out of it, and depressed.  
她的目光失焦，飘向地面。内心的火花试图驱散周遭的沉重。她感到疼痛、麻木、恍惚，陷入了抑郁。

What pushed her to return was that Shinji was still here. He wouldn't let her go.  
促使她回来的原因是真嗣还在这里。他不会让她离开。

She desired to engage with him. Whether she would berate him for hijacking her, or answer his charity with affection, she wanted to take some agency back and respond.  
她渴望与他互动。无论是斥责他劫持自己，还是以情感回应他的善意，她都想夺回一些主动权并作出回应。

The struggle uphill was nearly vertical though, because it was still hard to care. Shinji only did what he did out of guilt, in spite of what he may have said. She would never pilot Eva again, so her life was over. Nothing that had happened since Shinji's intervention had conclusively changed anything.  
尽管如此，上坡的挣扎几乎是垂直的，因为关心起来仍然很难。真嗣所做的一切只是出于内疚，尽管他可能说过什么。她再也不会驾驶 Eva 了，所以她的生活结束了。自从真嗣介入以来发生的一切，并没有确切地改变任何事情。

_That's not true_, a small voice inside of her said. But that was lost in the nihilistic churning.  
那不是真的，她内心一个小小的声音说道。但这声音淹没在了虚无主义的漩涡中。

So she easily lapsed into inactivity again, the spark snuffed once more. She was comatose when Shinji returned.  
于是她又轻易地陷入了沉寂，火花再次被熄灭。当真嗣回来时，她已处于昏迷状态。

Bare pants against him chafed uncomfortably, but at least he had something dry for Asuka to wear down there. He stopped beside her, noticing she had shifted a little. "Asuka," he asked, "can… can you hear me?"  
紧贴着他的短裤摩擦得极不舒服，但至少他给明日香准备了干爽的衣物。他停在她身边，注意到她稍微动了一下。“明日香，”他问道，“你……你能听见我说话吗？”

When she didn't respond he sighed, disappointed that she hadn't improved. "I hope I'm helping…" he uttered. Holding his briefs he tried to figure out how to get them on her, and decided he didn't just want to lay her on the ground. He looked about his surroundings again.  
见她没有回应，他叹了口气，失望于她并未有所改善。“希望我是在帮忙……”他低声说道。他拿着内裤，试图弄清楚如何给她穿上，并决定不想只是让她躺在地上。他再次环顾四周。

That's when, suddenly, it clicked. He knew where he was. He was standing in what used to be the main building of Tokyo-3 municipal high. It had been razed to its foundations in the blast, but he could see where everything should have gone.  
就在这时，突然间，他恍然大悟。他知道自己身处何地了。他正站在曾经是东京-3 市立高中的主楼遗址上。这里在大爆炸中被夷为平地，但他能看出原本一切应有的位置。

He then traveled out of a 'classroom', went down the 'hall' to a 'utility closet'. He shifted some of the rubble to find some cleaning rags, which he used as soft padding to help dress Asuka. It was softer than the pavement, at least.  
随后，他从一个‘教室’出来，沿着‘走廊’走到一个‘杂物间’。他挪开一些瓦砾，找到了一些清洁用的抹布，用作柔软的衬垫来帮助给明日香穿衣。至少比柏油路面要柔软些。

"Sorry, Asuka…" He uttered as he grabbed her underwear and slid the wet thing down her legs. Setting it aside, he hooked his briefs on her legs and slid them up, trying to do his best without staring at her bottomless torso.  
"对不起，明日香……" 他低声说着，抓住她的内裤，顺着她的腿将那湿漉漉的东西往下拉。将其放在一旁后，他将自己的平角裤套在她的腿上，往上拉，尽量不去盯着她那裸露的躯干，努力做到最好。

The garment in place, he stalled over her body as she lay on her back. His head swung to look down at her face, and her blue tile-eyes stared back up at him. A mote of heat touched his heart as he identified the intimate staging he found himself in.  
衣物穿戴整齐后，他俯身在她仰卧的身躯上。他的头转向一侧，低头凝视她的面庞，而她那如蓝色瓷砖般的双眼也回望着他。一丝暖意触动了他的心，他意识到自己正身处这亲密无间的场景之中。

If… if things were different, this would be delightfully romantic. But this was colored by the fact that… she wasn't there. She was still so out of it she might as well still be a doll. And he was exploiting her injury for another self-gratifying moment. He sighed with disgust as he realized what he was doing.  
倘若情况有所不同，这本该是令人愉悦的浪漫。然而，这一切因一个事实而失色——她并不在场。她依旧神志不清，仿佛仍是那个玩偶。而他，正利用她的伤痛，为自己再添一次自我满足的瞬间。意识到自己的所作所为，他厌恶地叹了口气。

"I… I wish… you were here." He said down to her eyes, before cynicism completely took the moment away. "I wish we could be like this, and you could be happy. I… I hate that I can't just make you better!"  
“我……我希望……你在这里。”他凝视着她的双眼说道，然而讽刺的是，这一刻很快就被彻底夺走了。“我多么希望我们能这样，你能快乐。我……我讨厌自己无法让你好起来！”

His face had contorted with sadness. Between the shame of taking from Asuka once again, and the sorrow that this simple wish for affection was inconsiderate of her desires, he started to weep. He was in the wrong for even wanting to have an intimate moment with her- a moment he was sure she would deny him most vehemently.  
他的脸因悲伤而扭曲。在再次从明日香那里索取的羞愧与因未顾及她愿望而渴望情感的悲伤之间，他开始哭泣。他甚至想要与她共度亲密时刻的想法都是错误的——他确信她会极力拒绝。

He wiped his face, but two of his tears landed on her cheeks. She blinked in response, her eyes moving a little to look at him. Through the din of her woes, she heard him.  
他擦了擦脸，但两滴泪水落在了她的脸颊上。她眨了眨眼作为回应，目光微微移动，看向他。在她的悲伤喧嚣中，她听到了他的声音。

Shinji stood suddenly to walk his emotions off when-  
真嗣突然站起身来，试图通过行走平复自己的情绪，就在这时——

"Shin…ji…" 真…嗣…

His eyes widened and he returned to her side. "Asuka? Asuka, are you there?"  
他睁大了眼睛，回到她身边。“明日香？明日香，你在吗？”

Her eyes bobbed in her head and then gently closed. Grabbing her back and lifting her, he gently shook her. "Asuka, come back to me! Come… come back…"  
她的眼珠在眼眶里晃动了一下，随后缓缓闭上。他抓住她的背部，将她抬起，轻轻摇晃着她。“明日香，回到我身边来！回来…回来…”

Her eyes didn't open. He cried as he held her in the ruin of their old school.  
她的眼睛没有睁开。他抱着她在他们旧学校的废墟中哭泣。

---
**III.**

She reeked of him, now.  
她现在浑身都是他的气息。

When she was semi-conscious next, she was again on Shinji's back. Her face was up against his neck, and her arms over his shoulders again. His smell was pervasive now, consuming. Choking.  
当她再次半清醒时，她又趴在了真嗣的背上。她的脸紧贴着他的脖子，手臂再次搭在他的肩上。他的气味现在无处不在，强烈到令人窒息。

The inner sea of her emotions churned as she drifted against Shinji. The boy was saving her, personally. But he did it out of guilt for ignoring her. But he did it because he wanted romantic moments with her. But he did it because he's a selfish pervert taking advantage of her comatose state. But he did it because he couldn't let her die.  
她内心的情感之海汹涌澎湃，随着她与真嗣的漂流。这个男孩正在救她，亲自出手。但他这么做是因为对忽视她的内疚。但他这么做是因为他想与她共度浪漫时光。但他这么做是因为他是个自私的变态，趁她昏迷不醒占她便宜。但他这么做是因为他不能让她死去。

Emotions sloshed in her mind like the ocean in a bottle toy. The motes of her consciousness danced with it, trying to make sense of how she felt. And determine if she _cared._  
她的思绪如同瓶中海洋玩具般翻腾。意识的微粒随之起舞，试图理清自己的感受。并决定她是否在乎。

Shinji spoke then. "I'm starting to get hungry Asuka, so I think you're getting hungry too. Let's find a place to get food."  
真嗣此时开口了：“我开始觉得饿了，明日香，我想你也是。我们找个地方吃点东西吧。”

That was rich. He cared about her feelings _now?_ She sought death. He interrupted that.  
真是讽刺。他现在在乎她的感受了？她寻求死亡。他打断了那一切。

_Because he cares about_ _you_, the voice of doubt had said.  
因为他关心你，那怀疑的声音曾说。

Then why didn't he _do anything_? _Huh_? Her challenge went unanswered at first.  
那他为什么什么都没做？嗯？她的质问起初没有得到回应。

_How much do you know about him, really_? Doubt answered, _he may have his reasons. It's not like you were super up front with him, Miss Suggestive Innuendo._  
你到底对他了解多少？怀疑回应道，他可能有他的理由。你也不是完全坦诚对他，不是吗，暗示小姐。

What did she need to learn? She knew everything already. She was smarter than everyone; she held a _university degree_. The sky was blue. Water was wet. Thermal expansion occurred when temperature changed the dimensions and properties of an object. Shinji was an idiot who ignored her advances and chased miss perfect wondergirl.  
她还需要学什么？她已经无所不知。她比任何人都聪明；她拥有大学学位。天空是蓝色的。水是湿的。温度改变物体的尺寸和性质时会发生热胀冷缩。真嗣是个傻瓜，无视她的示好，却去追求那位完美无瑕的奇迹女孩。

_Why is he doing so much to make sure_ you _get to safety, then, and not wasting time with her?_  
那他为什么还要这么努力确保你安全，而不是在她身上浪费时间呢？

_He's just that guilty. He'll say or do anything to feel better. Besides, if he's afraid of her and Misato, I'm the last 'safe' female with a pulse in his world.  
他就是那么内疚。他会说或做任何事来让自己感觉好些。再说，如果他害怕她和美里，那我就是他世界里最后一个有脉搏的‘安全’女性了。_

Her butt landed on the ground again as Shinji set her down gently. They were in the remains of another convenience store.  
她的屁股再次着地，因为真嗣轻轻地将她放下。他们身处另一家便利店的废墟中。

"Stay here, I'll find something for us to have for lunch." He uttered, then stood.  
“待在这儿，我去找点东西给我们当午餐。”他说完，便站起身来。

Shinji's feet trudged off, his back bent and his breath tired and ragged. He wiped his brow. Shinji had been carrying Asuka for a while. Outside the sun was just after midday.  
真嗣的脚步沉重地挪动着，背弯着，呼吸疲惫而急促。他擦了擦额头。真嗣已经背着明日香走了一段时间。外面的太阳刚过正午。

_Look at him, tired from carrying your useless carcass across town just to sate his lingering guilt. God, your pathetic.  
看看他，因为背着你这个废物穿过城镇而疲惫不堪，只是为了平息他那挥之不去的内疚。天啊，你真可悲。_

She was dimly aware of the sounds of rummaging in the convenience store before Shinji returned. He had another nutrition drink for her, and she endured another attempt from him to get her to drink it.  
她隐约意识到便利店里翻找东西的声音，随后真嗣回来了。他又给她带来了一瓶营养饮料，她忍受着他再次试图让她喝下去的尝试。

This time she noted the expression on his face: concern, mixed with satisfaction, as he poured into her mouth and she swallowed as she was supposed to. Hesitance was on his face when she finished, then he looked at her with a glimmer of hope. "Asuka… are you there? Can… you hear me?"  
"这次她注意到了他脸上的表情：关切中夹杂着满足，当他倒入她口中，她按要求吞咽时。她结束后，他脸上露出了犹豫，然后带着一丝希望看向她。“明日香…你在吗？能…听到我说话吗？””

Asuka considered trying to humor him, but the effort wasn't worth it. Maybe it would make him guilt-cry again.  
"明日香考虑过试着逗他开心，但这个努力不值得。或许这会让他再次内疚地哭泣。”

Shinji did turn away sadly and stared away at the innards of the convenience store. "Look familiar?" He asked, glancing back at her. "It's where you ran off to after… after Ayanami replaced you in the sync training."  
"真嗣悲伤地转过身，凝视着便利店的内部。“看起来熟悉吗？”他回头问她。“这是你在绫波取代你在同步训练后跑去的地方。””

Now that he mentioned it, the rows did look familiar. They were bereft of products now, with two glass doors shattered, but still recognizable.  
经他这么一说，那些货架确实看起来很眼熟。现在货架上空无一物，两扇玻璃门也已破碎，但依旧能辨认出来。

He started speaking again. "I… I had a c-crush on you, then. But it was that night… that night when you threw yourself into it. I think.. I think that's when I _knew_ I liked you. Because you were so determined to win. Before then I never met anyone like you. You were amazing."  
他再次开口说道：“我……我当时对你有好感。但就是那个晚上……你全身心投入的那个晚上。我想……我想就是那时我知道我喜欢上了你。因为你那么坚决要赢。在那之前，我从没遇到过像你这样的人。你太棒了。”

Asuka's tired, tile blue eyes rolled to look at him. But he was looking away from her, into the past.  
明日香那疲惫的瓷砖蓝眼睛转向他，但他却避开了她的目光，沉浸在回忆中。

"But as time went on, and you kept making fun of me… I figured out that you didn't like me after all. When… on the night you kissed me I almost… I almost thought I was wrong, that maybe you liked me and just couldn't say it. But… then when you plugged my nose I guess you really were just bored. S-so…" he lapsed into silence.  
"但随着时间的推移，你一直取笑我……我意识到你其实并不喜欢我。当……在你吻我的那个晚上，我几乎……我几乎以为我错了，也许你是喜欢我的，只是说不出口。但是……后来你捏我的鼻子，我想你真的只是无聊而已。所以……" 他陷入了沉默。

_Wait. What? 等等。什么？_

"I don't think I'd have the guts to tell you this if you were here… so… I guess this is as good a time as any to confess since… since I can't help you get better." He stood then and said, "let's see if there's a working phone in here, so we can get help."  
我想如果你在这里，我可能没有勇气告诉你这些……所以……我想现在坦白是个不错的时机，因为我无法帮你恢复。”他说着站起身来，“我们看看这里有没有能用的电话，好叫人来帮忙。”

She tried to lift her hand to touch him, but she only managed to wiggle easily overlooked fingers. He stood and started walking to the cash register.  
她试图抬起手去触摸他，却只能勉强动动容易被忽视的手指。他站起身，开始向收银台走去。

The flower of possibility was rapidly blooming in her mind knowing now that Shinji, in fact, liked her all this time. And her own abrasiveness had blocked the possibility she had so hoped for.  
得知新二其实一直喜欢她，她心中的可能性之花迅速绽放。而她自己的尖锐态度，却阻隔了那个她一直渴望的可能性。

_He didn't do anything because he has the disposition of a mouse, and you intimidated the hell out of him. What did you expect?  
他什么也没做，因为他胆小如鼠，你把他吓得魂飞魄散。你还指望什么呢？_

A sinkhole of regret had opened up. It was consuming her feelings now, sucking her down into another level of despair of her own making.  
一个悔恨的深渊裂开了。它正在吞噬她的情感，将她拖入由她自己造成的另一层绝望之中。

Shinji came back, kneeling down in front of her. He was looking into her eyes. "I managed to reach the paramedics, they're on their way, Asuka."  
真嗣回来了，跪在她面前。他正凝视着她的眼睛。“我联系上了急救人员，他们正在赶来，明日香。”

She pushed. She had to reach Shinji, overcoming the lethargy and despair. She sucked in a breath and tried to move.  
她用力推着。她必须到达真嗣那里，克服那股倦怠和绝望。她深吸一口气，试图移动。

She succeeded only after he had stood up to return to the phone. Her hand moved a little. She tried calling out to him, but her voice had no purchase on her vocal cords, and her word came out as an utterance.  
直到他站起来准备回去接电话时，她才成功。她的手动了动。她试图呼唤他，但她的声音无法控制声带，话语出口时只是一声低语。

He was leaving her. 他正离她而去。

She was running out of time. She would be taken to the hospital, God knows where, and he would leave thinking she didn't want him.  
她快没时间了。她将被送往医院，天知道是哪里，而他则会离开，以为她不想要他了。

She had to fight. As pathetic as a reason this was, simply coming back for the desires of one stupid, frustrating boy, that flower of possibility had bloomed bright. It was in that moment where she faced losing him again that she realized why she desired him so much.  
她必须战斗。尽管这个理由听起来多么可悲，仅仅是为了一个愚蠢又令人抓狂的男孩的欲望而回来，但那可能性的花朵已经盛开得如此灿烂。正是在她再次面临失去他的那一刻，她才意识到自己为何如此渴望他。

No matter how thorny she had been, he was always there. Especially now, after seeing her in this state he had sacrificed time, effort, and even his own modesty for her. This wasn't guilt, this was something else.  
无论她曾经多么带刺，他始终在那里。尤其是现在，看到她这副模样后，他牺牲了时间、努力，甚至自己的尊严来照顾她。这不是内疚，而是别的东西。

It was more than anyone had done before on her behalf. Not even Kaji had gone to this length for her.  
这是为了她，任何人都不曾做到的程度。就连卡吉也没有为她做到这个地步。

Factors were such that Section Two was far out of position when the ambulance arrived to pick up Asuka Soryu Langley. Additionally, nearly every Geofront access point into the base had been destroyed by Eva 00's self destruction. So, she would be driven on the easier route to the Hakone National Hospital some distance away, then moved to the Geofront later.  
情况是这样的：当救护车到达接走惣流·明日香·兰格雷时，第二区已经远远偏离了位置。此外，几乎所有进入基地的地下都市入口都被零号机的自毁摧毁了。因此，她将被送往较近的箱根国立医院，稍后再转移到地下都市。

Shinji was with her as the EMTs had placed Asuka on the gurney and wheeled her through the ruins of the convenience store. He waited next to it sadly as the EMTs prepared to load her.  
真嗣与她同在，当急救人员将明日香安置在担架上，推着她穿过便利店的废墟时。他悲伤地站在旁边，等待急救人员准备将她装载上车。

Shinji stared at her. "I-im sorry Asuka, I'll sorry I couldn't-"  
真嗣盯着她。“我、我很抱歉，明日香，对不起，我没能——”

Her hand lifted then, startling him with her sudden movement. Her splayed fingers grabbed his shirt hard and pulled gently. His eyes widened and his heart raced as he looked at Her.  
她的手随即抬起，突如其来的动作让他一惊。她张开的手指紧紧抓住他的衬衫，轻柔地拉扯。他睁大了眼睛，心跳加速，凝视着她。

Irises had replaced the tiles. Color had come back to her skin. Her lips parted. "Shinji… stay… with…."  
鸢尾花取代了瓦片。她的肌肤恢复了血色。她的嘴唇微微张开。“真嗣……留……在……”

_Me._ He realized. He could read it in her eyes, and In that moment he desired to do nothing else.  
他意识到了。他能从她的眼神中读懂，那一刻，他只想做这件事。

When the EMTs approached the gurney to load her into the ambulance, Shinji asked them, "Can I go with you? She's my roommate, I need to make sure she's okay."  
当急救人员靠近担架准备将她抬上救护车时，真嗣向他们请求道：“我能跟你们一起去吗？她是我的室友，我得确保她没事。”

The A10 connectors were forgotten in the convenience store.  
A10 连接器被遗忘在便利店了。

Within the hour, the last angel was descending into the Terminal Dogma, having hijacked unit 02.  
不到一小时，最后的天使已降临至终结教条，劫持了二号机。

In the bridge, Misato was frantic. "What do you mean, you can't locate the third children?!"  
在舰桥上，美里焦急万分。“你什么意思，找不到第三适格者了？！”

Makoto spun. "He's not in his last reported position! Search parties are investigating the city now!"  
真琴转身说道：“他不在最后报告的位置！搜查队现在正在城市中调查！”

"What about the second?" 第二个呢？

"Also reported missing!" 也报失踪！

All at once Misato's failures as a guardian had swept up to her. Her neglect of the children now came to roost in the final defense of humanity. She swayed on her feet, but her mind moved to the next move to make. "Hyuga-"  
突然间，碇真嗣作为监护人的失败如潮水般涌上心头。她对孩子们的疏忽如今在人类最后的防御中显现出来。她脚步踉跄，但思绪已转向下一步行动。“日向——”

"Evangelion 01 in pursuit!" Shigeru reported, "w-with Rei?"  
"初号机正在追击！" 贞治报告道，"和绫波一起吗？"

Misato asked, "is Rei piloting?"  
碇真嗣问道：“是绫波在驾驶吗？”

Maya spoke, "No occupant in the plug!"  
玛雅说道：“插槽内无乘客！”

Misato blinked. "Then how is-"  
葛城美里眨了眨眼。“那怎么是-”

---

The two Evangelions clashed in the depths of the terminal Dogma. Neither was manned, but both were driven.  
两台福音战士在终端教条的深处激烈交锋。尽管无人驾驶，但二者皆被驱动。

Tabris winced. "I see. Just as Evangelion 02 was born from Adam, Evangelion 01 was born from Lilith. I see now, quite ingenious, these Lilin."  
塔布里斯皱了皱眉。“我明白了。正如二号机源自亚当，一号机则源自莉莉丝。现在我明白了，真是巧妙，这些人类。”

Rei floated opposite of Tabris as her avatar moved and clashed with the puppet Tabris was manipulating. Both calling upon their bodies to act.  
绫波漂浮在塔布里斯对面，她的化身与塔布里斯操纵的傀儡交锋。双方都在调动自己的身体行动。

Tabris, smiling still, said to Rei, "How shall you and I decide the fate of the Lilin then? They are most persistent in their efforts, even if they don't comprehend what they do, or what they want."  
塔布里斯依旧微笑着对丽说：“那么，你我该如何决定人类的命运呢？他们虽然不明白自己在做什么，或者他们想要什么，但他们的努力却异常执着。”

Rei winced. "Annihilation."  
绫波皱了皱眉。“湮灭。”

Tabris lifted his head. "I approve. A clean sweep, and all their toys are gone. And we return to our beginning."  
塔布里斯抬起头。“我同意。一扫而空，他们的玩具全没了。我们将回到起点。”

"Yes." Rei answered. The AT field of Unit 01 began to invert. And with it, so did unit 02's.  
"是的。" 绫波回答道。初号机的 AT 力场开始反转。与此同时，二号机的 AT 力场也随之反转。

Tabris closed his eyes. "A shame, I would have liked to meet the third. I heard he was a nice person."  
塔布里斯闭上了眼睛。“真遗憾，我本想见见第三位的。听说他是个不错的人。”

Rei lifted her head, staring through rock and soil at the Ikari she chose. "Goodbye Shinji."  
绫波抬起头，透过岩石与土壤凝望着她所选择的碇真嗣。“再见，真嗣。”

The seeds also inverted their AT fields.  
种子也将它们的 AT 力场反转了。

Within moments, a sphere of annihilation consumed the geofront. In it Gendo's wishes, Misato's disappointments, and SEELE's tools for instrumentality all vanished in the hot white flash of oblivion.  
顷刻间，一个湮灭之球吞噬了地下都市。在其中，源渡的愿望、美里失望，以及 SEELE 用于人类补完计划的工具，都在炽热的白光中化为乌有。

There were no survivors.  
无人生还。

Gradually Asuka's senses and strength returned. Little by little her consciousness was able to salvage control of her body as her will gradually asserted itself. Depression still hung like a fog in her mind, but there were lights and signposts now to help her navigate it.  
渐渐地，明日香的感官和力量恢复了。她的意识一点一点地重新掌控了身体，意志也逐渐坚定起来。尽管抑郁仍如迷雾般笼罩心头，但如今已有光亮和路标指引她穿越其中。

One of these was Shinji.  
其中之一便是真嗣。

He wasn't always around when she had a lucid moment, but he was in her recovery room often enough to convince her he was invested. She had not forgotten what he said in the convenience store, and it ached at her to have a chance to validate his sentiments.  
她清醒时他未必总在身边，但他频繁出现在她的康复室里，足以让她相信他的用心。她未曾忘记他在便利店说过的话，内心渴望有机会去证实他的情感。

A time came, finally, when she woke and felt _present_. Her eyes cracked open, and it felt like she had emerged from a long, lucid dream.  
终于有一天，她醒来时感到自己真实存在。她睁开眼睛，仿佛刚从一个漫长的清醒梦中苏醒。

One where her body had been hammered by hundreds of tiny mallets.  
她的身体仿佛被数百个小木槌敲打过一般。

Shinji was asleep against the side of the bed, head on the cot, resting on his arms.  
真嗣靠在床边睡着了，头枕在简易床上，双臂支撑着。

She reached up and over with her waving right arm, fingers running through his hair as she gripped his scalp. "Dummy." She uttered quietly.  
她抬起右手，越过头顶，手指穿过他的发丝，紧抓着他的头皮。“傻瓜。”她轻声说道。

Shinji stirred at her touch. He raised his head, wiped an eye, and realized what was going on. "A…Asuka! You're awake!" He looked into her eyes and realized… she was.. "_You're here_! You're back! I…i'm…i'm…" he immediately started crying with relief.  
真嗣在她的触碰下动了动。他抬起头，擦了擦眼睛，意识到发生了什么。“A…Asuka！你醒了！”他凝视着她的眼睛，意识到……她是……“你在这里！你回来了！我…我…我…”他立刻如释重负地哭了起来。

Asuka was at a loss over how to proceed. She had Shinji's confession yes but, seeing him literally break down and cry that she was alive and okay?  
明日香不知所措，她确实听到了真嗣的告白，但是，看到他因为得知她还活着并且安然无恙而崩溃哭泣？

She… she mattered to… to him… that much? Water was forming in her own eyes.  
她……她对他……有那么重要吗？她的眼眶也开始湿润了。

"Idiot," She toned at him with as much strength as she could, drawing his head up. "Why didn't you say anything sooner? Why didn't you tell me I mattered to you like that? I need… needed to hear it from you!"  
“笨蛋，”她用尽全力对他说道，抬起他的头。“为什么你不早点说？为什么你不告诉我，我对你来说那么重要？我需要……需要从你那里听到这些！”

His face had come up with surprise, but only contorted again to sadness before he buried his face into the bed sheets.  
他脸上先是露出惊讶，但随即又扭曲成悲伤，接着便将脸埋进了床单中。

She pulled at him. His hair, then his shirt as he moved up the bed to land on her side. Her hand had snaked under his arm to press him against her.  
她拉扯着他，先是头发，然后是衬衫，随着他挪到床的另一侧，落在她身边。她的手已经悄悄伸到他的腋下，将他紧紧按向自己。

The door opened just then to admit a nurse, who hesitated at the two crying teens, one embracing the other. Behind the nurse, a girl stepped up and saw the scene. Hikari hesitated, then said, "I can come back in a few minutes."  
就在这时，门开了，一位护士走了进来，她看到两个哭泣的少年，一个拥抱着另一个，不禁犹豫了一下。护士身后，一个女孩走上前来，目睹了这一幕。光犹豫了一下，然后说：“我可以过几分钟再回来。”

_End of Part I. 第一部分完结。_

_A/N: This could be a place to leave off, and I'm publishing it to this point, but there's more to say after this. Both children now have no purpose, and their old lives before Eva beckon.
