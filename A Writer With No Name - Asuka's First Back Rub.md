Asuka 的第一次背部按摩

**Author's Note: This is an Apocrypha/Omake for Panther2G's** _**Advice & Trust**_**, read that story (or at least a little bit of it) to get the full picture.**  
作者注：这是 Panther2G 的《Advice & Trust》的外传/番外，阅读那部作品（至少部分内容）以获得完整背景。

It was seven PM on a Wednesday evening, the Red Demon and her Baka sat on the couch watching whatever the hell popped on then. The two were relaxed, both holding each other's hands. Misato was out with Kaji, so they had the house to themselves. Usually this meant they'd find the time to fuck each other's brains out. However, this night they were taking it slow.  
那是周三晚上七点，红发魔女和她的笨蛋正坐在沙发上，随便看着电视上播放的任何节目。两人都很放松，手牵手依偎着。美里和加持出去了，所以家里只有他们俩。通常这意味着他们会找时间疯狂地亲热一番。然而，今晚他们选择慢慢来。

The 7 o'clock news was on, some story about the world and how shitty it was today. They both sensed that they wanted to watch an action show, but those didn't come on until eight. Board and tired, all they wanted was something fun to do before the really good stuff began. It seemed tempting to just break out and start right there on the couch. That was until Shinji let go of Asuka's hand.  
七点新闻正在播放，是关于世界现状的报道，一如既往地糟糕。他们都感觉到想看动作片，但那些要到八点才开始。无聊又疲惫，他们只想在真正精彩的内容开始前找点乐子。似乎很诱人，干脆就在沙发上开始亲热。直到真嗣放开了明日香的手。

Asuka looked away from the TV and down to their hands. Shinji brought his hand up to her face and brought her closer for a kiss. She took this as a sign that the time was up and they'd get down to business. So she reached for the button on the top of his collared shirt. But once she unbuttoned it, Shinji stopped her hand with his free one.  
明日香从电视上移开目光，低头看向他们的手。真嗣将手抬到她的脸颊旁，拉近她准备亲吻。她以此为信号，意识到时间已到，该进入正题了。于是她伸手去解他衣领上的扣子。但刚解开一颗，真嗣就用他空着的那只手阻止了她。

He pulled back slightly and opened his eyes. She followed suit and both of them shared the same intense stare they shared every night.  
他微微后退，睁开了眼睛。她也跟着睁眼，两人再次共享每晚都会有的那股深沉凝视。

"Believe or not, that's not what I had in mind." he said cracking a smile.  
“信不信由你，我心里想的可不是这个。”他笑着说，嘴角勾起一抹微笑。

Asuka slowly started to laugh. She wrapped her arms around him and kept laughing into his shoulder. It sounded like she was crying, but Shinji couldn't help but smile.  
明日香慢慢地开始笑了起来。她用双臂环抱着他，笑声不断传入他的肩膀。那声音听起来像是在哭泣，但真嗣还是忍不住微笑了。

"Is that so?" she said raising her head to meet his gaze again.  
“是吗？”她抬起头再次迎上他的目光，说道。

"What do you want to do me?" she said with a wicked grin.  
“你想对我做什么？”她带着邪恶的笑容说道。

"I just wanted…to pay you back." Shinji said reaching his hand under her tank top. And around to her back, where he started to massage her.  
"我只是想……回报你。" 真嗣说着，伸手探入她的背心，绕到她的背后，开始为她按摩。

Asuka felt every hair on her skin raise up. Her eyes widened, she tensed all over and gripped Shinji tighter now. Looking at him with a surprised look. With that look, Shinji stopped.  
明日香感到皮肤上的每一根毛发都竖了起来。她的眼睛睁大，全身紧绷，现在更紧地抓住了真嗣。她惊讶地看着他，带着那样的表情，真嗣停了下来。

"Oh ...is that sensitive. I didn't mean-"  
"哦……那里很敏感吗？我不是故意的——"

"Don't stop, please continue." she said with an even more intense look. Different from when she would ask him why he was crying. More on the lines of this being something she so desperately needed.  
"请不要停，继续吧。" 她以更加热切的目光说道。与她询问他为何哭泣时不同，此刻的她似乎迫切需要这种感觉。

The look then turned to dust when Shinji started to rub up near the center of her back near her shoulder blades. She turned to jello and fell onto him. Her eyes were rolling back in satisfaction, she could barely control her muscles. Her weight brought Shinji down onto the couch, she nearly pinned him in place. This stopped him though and Asuka gained control again. She looked at him in confusion.  
然而，当真嗣开始在她背部中央靠近肩胛骨的位置轻抚时，她的表情瞬间瓦解。她变得软弱无力，倒在了他身上。她的眼睛因满足而翻白，几乎无法控制自己的肌肉。她的重量将真嗣压倒在沙发上，几乎将他固定在原地。这一停顿让明日香重新掌控了局面，她困惑地看着他。

"Why'd you stop?" she said into his shoulder. Where her head had fallen.  
"你为什么停下来了？" 她将头靠在他的肩膀上，声音从那里传来。

"Um…..if you want to spin around I could…...have better reach."  
"嗯……如果你想转圈的话，我可以……有更好的范围。"

"Mmmm, no, here's fine. Don't stop until I say so…please."  
"嗯，不用，这里就好。不要停，直到我说停为止……拜托了。"

Shinji took the hint, and undid her bra so he could have better range. She didn't object, not that she would to begin with.  
真嗣领会了她的意思，解开了她的胸罩以便有更大的活动空间。她并没有反对，其实她一开始就不会反对。

The massage carried on for around ten minutes. Until Asuka finally broke the silence.  
按摩持续了大约十分钟。直到明日香最终打破了沉默。

"What do you mean repay me?" she asked.  
"你说的'报答我'是什么意思？" 她问道。

Shinji kissed her check. 真嗣亲吻了她的脸颊。

"Your the only one who I can talk to. And…..the first person to ever tell me 'I love you'. I wanted to pay you back for giving me a purpose to life …..and you already know all my recipes."  
"你是唯一一个我可以倾诉的人。而且……你是第一个对我说'我爱你'的人。我想回报你给予我生活的意义……你也已经知道了我所有的食谱。"

This got her to laugh again. She raised her head, she was smiling and crying. Her tears fell on Shinji's face. So she whipped them off. Only to realize it wasn't just her tears. They just stared at each other for a while, smiling and crying. Then, they kissed again and Shinji proceed with the massage. Asuka had a bit more resistance to it now, though she did heavily enjoy it.  
这让她再次笑了起来。她抬起头，脸上带着笑容，眼中含泪。她的泪水滴落在真嗣的脸上。于是她擦去了泪水。这时她才发现，不只是她的泪水。他们就这样对视了一会儿，边笑边哭。然后，他们再次接吻，真嗣继续按摩。明日香现在对此有了一些抵抗力，尽管她非常享受。

Eventually she pulled back and as a result Shinji stopped.  
最终她退后一步，真嗣也随之停下了动作。

"This…is the first time anyone has massaged my back."  
"这…是第一次有人给我按摩背部。"

Shinji simply looked at her with the same caring smile.  
真嗣只是带着同样的关怀微笑看着她。

"I can tell, I'm no massage expert, but you've got a lot of knots back there."  
我能感觉到，虽然我不是按摩专家，但你背上有很多结。

"That doesn't turn you off now does it?"  
"那现在不会让你反感吧？"

"No, it makes me happy that I found something that I can help you with."  
"不，我很高兴找到了能帮到你的事情。"

"Oh Baka ...you've helped me with more than just my back problems. But…"  
"哦，笨蛋……你帮我的不仅仅是背痛问题。但是……"

Her look turned into even more caring then before.  
她的眼神比以往更加关切了。

"You…..never found a real reason to live? Before I came along?"  
你……在我出现之前，从未找到真正活下去的理由吗？

Shinji looked guilty, he was about to say what he always answered with. But stopped himself just in time.  
真嗣看起来有些内疚，他正要像往常一样回答，但及时停住了。

"Sor-...yes." "Sor-...是的。"

His grip grew tighter. He closed his eyes and slowly began to cry again.  
他的握力变得更紧了。他闭上眼睛，慢慢地又开始哭泣起来。

"Nobody told me they loved me. Nobody… I had no reason to live. Because, no one would mourn my death. No one would attend my funeral. So….I just existed. Breathing in the air that probably should've gone to somebody else."  
"没有人告诉我他们爱我。没有人……我没有活下去的理由。因为，没有人会哀悼我的死亡。没有人会参加我的葬礼。所以……我只是存在着。呼吸着本该属于别人的空气。"

He opened his eyes, Asuka was even closer. Her look now worrisome, but also understanding. Shinji simply smiled and stroked her face.  
他睁开眼睛，明日香靠得更近了。她的表情现在显得忧虑，但同时也理解。真嗣只是微笑着，轻抚她的脸颊。

"Please don't worry…..I love you. That's all that matters to me now."  
请不要担心……我爱你。现在这对我来说就是全部。

Asuka grew a smile across her tear filled face. She then leaned in closer.  
明日香在她那泪眼婆娑的脸上绽放出笑容。随后，她更靠近了一些。

"I love you too…roll over."  
"我也爱你…翻个身。"

Shinji was now confused. 真嗣现在感到困惑。

"What?" "什么？"

"Roll over Shinji. I want to repay you for giving me more of a purpose in life. Just like I've done for you."  
翻个身，真嗣。我想报答你，因为你给了我更多生活的意义。就像我为你所做的那样。

Her earnest smile made Shinji go along with it. And much like Asuka, when he felt smooth hands rubbing against his back. He lost all control. Though, he did gain enough control to take off his shirt.  
她真挚的笑容让真嗣顺从了。就像明日香一样，当他感觉到光滑的手掌摩擦着他的背部时，他失去了所有的控制。尽管如此，他还是设法控制住自己，脱掉了衬衫。

Fifteen minutes later, Shinji had gained up enough resistance to flip over. Surprising Asuka twice by doing so, and also not having her fall off the couch.  
十五分钟后，真嗣终于积攒了足够的抵抗力翻过身来。这让明日香惊讶了两次，一次是他翻身的动作，另一次是她没有从沙发上掉下来。

Both of them laughing at the position they now found themselves in. Shinji raised his hand up to caress Asuka's face.  
两人都对自己现在的姿势笑了起来。真嗣举起手，轻抚明日香的脸颊。

"Now, I do have that in mind."  
"现在，我确实考虑到了这一点。"

Asuka grinned ripped off her shirt. Lowering herself down onto Shinji, the two of them in each other's arms.  
明日香咧嘴一笑，猛地脱掉自己的衬衫。她俯身贴近真嗣，两人紧紧相拥。

"Mmmmm, maybe, mmmmm, we should, mmmmm, take this, into our room. Mmmmmmm, just in case." Shinji said through the multiple kisses.  
"嗯嗯，或许，嗯，我们应该，嗯，把这个，带到我们的房间去。嗯嗯嗯，以防万一。" 真嗣在连续的亲吻中说。

"Oh come on love, we fucked in a janitor's closet. What's wrong with here?" Asuka said pulling back.  
"哎呀，亲爱的，我们在清洁工的储藏室都做过。这里有什么问题吗？" 明日香说着，往后一拉。

"Well, maybe it's because I can do what I want too you in there." he said in a deep voice.  
"嗯，可能是因为我也能在里面随心所欲地对你做些什么。" 他低沉地说道。

This did turn her on, but she did like the feeling of being risky.  
这确实让她兴奋，但她确实喜欢这种冒险的感觉。

"Well then ...your going to have to carry me there." she said smiling seductively at him. Also giving him that physics demo with her chest she always talked about right up on his face.  
“那么……你得把我抱过去了。”她妩媚地笑着对他说，同时用她常提起的胸部物理演示，直接贴到了他的脸上。

Because of this, she didn't see Shinji's free hand wrap around her back. The free hand that wasn't feeling every other part of her.  
正因为如此，她没有注意到真嗣的另一只手已经环抱住她的后背。那只手并未触及其他任何部位。

"Al...All ...right." Shinji stuttered out.  
"好...好的。" 真嗣结结巴巴地说道。

The free hand that started massaging the back of her neck.  
那只手开始按摩她的后颈。

This made her moan and indeed lose control of her body. Closing her eyes, she again put her full weight on Shinji. She then felt her body moving and…..she was being carried by Shinji bridal style.  
这让她不禁呻吟，确实失去了对身体的控制。她闭上眼睛，再次将全部重量压在真嗣身上。随后，她感觉到自己的身体在移动，原来是被真嗣以新娘抱的方式抱了起来。

When she was laid down on their bed, and she felt her love's lips upon her own. She gained the strength to ask a question.  
当她被轻轻放在床上，感受到爱人的唇贴上自己的唇时，她获得了提问的力气。

"How did you know that I'd practically break down there?"  
“你怎么知道我差点在那里崩溃？”

She opened her eyes to the sight of Shinji kissing her hand. Almost completely on top of her, like he usually was at this time at night.  
她睁开眼，看到真嗣正亲吻着她的手。他几乎完全压在她身上，就像每晚这个时候他常做的那样。

"I didn't know ...guess I just got lucky."  
我没想到...可能只是运气好吧。

They both smiled. Asuka still held on to Shinji's hand.  
两人相视而笑。明日香依旧紧握着真嗣的手。

"Hmm, maybe the years of you working the cello paid off. Cause now you know how to work me."  
"嗯，或许你多年拉大提琴的功夫没白费。因为现在你知道怎么驾驭我了。"

The two held each other's hands, staring into each other's eyes. Then Asuka realized how she could work him.  
两人紧握着对方的手，凝视着彼此的眼睛。然后明日香意识到她该如何驾驭他。

"I love you Shinji…." she said as she laid herself out.  
"我爱你，真嗣……" 她说着，将自己展露无遗。

"I'm all yours." 我全听你的。

She was right, Shinji lost control. Though, he never let go of her hand. At least ...until they decided to try something else.  
她是对的，真嗣失控了。尽管如此，他从未放开她的手。至少...直到他们决定尝试别的事情。

**Author's Note: This is my most lemony FanFic yet, but I couldn't help myself. Next Fic is completely up for grabs. I don't know if it's going to be Chapter 2 in** _**Songs That Only They (Could) Hear**_**, a new story about Final Fantasy crossing over with Evangelion. Or another one of these Omakes where Shinji does something cool and funny.**  
作者注：这是我迄今为止最柠檬味的同人文，但我实在忍不住。下一篇完全待定。我不知道它会是《只有他们（能）听到的歌》第二章，还是关于《最终幻想》与《新世纪福音战士》交叉的新故事。或者是另一个这样的番外，真嗣做了些既酷又搞笑的事。
