Asuka sees something in Shinji one evening while watching him cooking dinner. COMPLETE!  
某晚，明日香在观看真嗣做饭时，从他身上看到了某些东西。完结！

---

Shinji Ikari was having a fairly good day. There had been no Angel attacks, school had come and gone for the day, and the teacher, as usual, hadn't noticed that the entire class, including Hikari, had slept through his oft-recited Second Impact lecture. In fact, there was very little that could go wrong at this point.  
碇真嗣今天过得相当不错。没有使徒袭击，学校的一天也结束了，而且老师一如既往地没有注意到全班同学，包括光，都在他那老生常谈的第二次冲击讲座中睡着了。实际上，此时此刻几乎没有什么会出错。  
  
"SHINJI!" “真嗣！”  
  
Scratch that. 别提了。  
  
The young man in question winced at at the tone of the voice bellowing his name from the bathroom. Asuka Langley Soryu used this tone exclusively with him, it seemed. And it was never a good thing.  
听到从浴室传来的那声呼喊自己名字的咆哮，这位年轻男子不禁皱了皱眉。明日香·兰格雷似乎只用这种语气对他讲话，而且每次都不是什么好事。  
  
"Y-yes, Asuka?" “什、什么事，明日香？”  
  
It was a good thing that Shinji was in the kitchen at the moment, because the sight of a towel-clad Asuka would have only served to instigate a massive nosebleed. The German firecracker glanced at the couch, where she had left her newly-purchased bottle of shampoo. Glancing towards the kitchen, she knew that she would never be able to get to it without Shinji catching a glimpse of her.  
幸好此时真嗣在厨房里，因为看到裹着毛巾的明日香只会让他鼻血狂喷。这位德国辣妹瞥了一眼沙发，她新买的洗发水瓶子就放在那里。她朝厨房方向望去，知道自己无论如何都无法在不引起真嗣注意的情况下拿到它。  
  
"Shinji, could you get me the bottle of shampoo on the couch, and leave it outside the bathroom? I don't want to give you a heart attack or anything by getting it myself."  
“真嗣，你能帮我把沙发上的那瓶洗发水拿到浴室门外吗？我自己去拿的话，怕是要把你吓出心脏病来。”  
  
Shinji began to turn red. "O-ok."  
真嗣的脸开始泛红。“好、好的。”  
  
He waited until he heard the door close, announcing the fact that Asuka was safely behind the door, before venturing into the living room. He immediately spied the bottle on the couch, and picked it up, reading the lable. It was a expensive brand, the scent of green tea. Curious, he opened the bottle for an experimental sniff.  
他一直等到听见门关上的声音，确认明日香已经安全地待在门后，才敢走进客厅。他立刻注意到沙发上的瓶子，拿起来阅读标签。这是一款昂贵的品牌，散发着绿茶的香气。好奇之下，他打开瓶盖，试探性地闻了闻。  
  
"Is there a problem out there?"  
“外面有什么问题吗？”  
  
Nearly dropping the bottle, he answered the redhead. "No, just wondering about the scent, that's all."  
他差点把瓶子掉在地上，回答那位红发女孩：“没有，只是对这香气有点好奇，仅此而已。”  
  
Not wishing to agitate her further, he left the bottle in the prescribed area, before retreating back into the kitchen to start on dinner.  
不想再激怒她，他按照规定将瓶子留在指定区域，然后退回厨房开始准备晚餐。  
***  
Asuka stood under the hot water, working the shampoo into her hair. The smell of green tea slowly permeated the air, soothing her. She had been tempted to try this brand after Hikari told her about it, wondering is the scent would have the same effects for her as it apparently did for Hikari. Standing there, the smell calming her normally firey attitude, she had to agree that it did.  
明日香站在热水下，用洗发水揉搓着头发。绿茶的香味渐渐弥漫在空气中，安抚着她。在光莉告诉她这款洗发水后，她一直想尝试，想知道这种香味是否对她也有同样的效果，就像对光莉那样。站在那里，这香气平息了她平日里的火爆脾气，她不得不承认确实有效。  
  
She vaguely wondered why Shinji took an interest. Of course she was the best looking girl in Tokyo-3, but she wouldn't expect him to actually show any interest in her, for fear of her killing him. Maybe he was growing up a little, perhaps even developing a spine.  
她隐约想知道真嗣为何会感兴趣。当然，她是第三新东京市最漂亮的女孩，但她没想到他真的会对她表现出兴趣，生怕她会杀了他。也许他正在成长，甚至可能正在培养一些勇气。  
  
She dismissed this thought, deciding that all the hot water and the scent of green tea must be affecting her thinking. Turning the shower off, she stepped out, dressing for dinner.  
她摒弃了这个念头，认为一定是热水和绿茶的香气影响了她的思考。关掉淋浴，她走出浴室，准备去吃晚餐。  
***  
Shinji stood in the kitchen, surveying his domain. The ingredients were laid out, ready to be transformed into a meal. For this evening, he had chosen an Italian dish, tiring of fixing ramen and miso soup constantly.  
真嗣站在厨房里，审视着自己的领地。食材已经摆好，准备被转化为一顿美餐。今晚，他选择了一道意大利菜，厌倦了总是做拉面和味噌汤。  
  
Getting out a saucepan, he started on the alfredo sauce first, since the noodles wouldn't take as long to prepare. First, he put in the butter, keeping the heat low so as not to burn it, but just to melt it. While keeping an eye on this, he put the heavy cream and egg whites into a mixing bowl, whipping them into a froth with the wire whisk. When the consistency was right, he added it to the butter, blending them until smooth. Then came the parmmesian cheese, already grated. He was careful not to add too much, or the flavor would be too strong.  
他拿出一个平底锅，首先开始做阿尔弗雷多酱，因为面条不需要那么长时间准备。首先，他放入黄油，保持低温以免烧焦，只是为了融化它。同时，他注意着这一点，将重奶油和蛋清放入搅拌碗中，用打蛋器打成泡沫。当稠度合适时，他将它们加入黄油中，搅拌至顺滑。然后是已经磨碎的帕尔马干酪。他小心不要加太多，否则味道会太浓。  
  
Setting the sauce to simmer, he then went to the noodles, putting them into a large pot with plenty of water to boil. He didn't want them to stick to the pan, so he added a bit of butter and a pinch of salt.  
将酱汁调至小火慢炖，他随后转向面条，将它们放入装满水的大锅中煮沸。他不希望面条粘在锅底，于是加入了一点黄油和一撮盐。  
  
Having finished the hard part, he sat back to watch over the stove. He wasn't sure why, but cooking was a stress relief for him. It didn't require him to pilot, didn't make him feel guilt over a mistake, or a death. It was good for it's own sake.  
完成了较为困难的部分后，他坐回炉子旁看守。他不确定为什么，但烹饪对他来说是一种减压方式。这不需要他驾驶，也不会因错误或死亡而感到内疚。烹饪本身就很好。  
  
He didn't notice Asuka standing behind him, watching his every move. She had dressed, smelling something positively heavenly coming from the kitchen. Observing his skill in the culinary arts caused her normally caustic opening comment to die a quick death. He seemed so...confident. The shyness, the aloofness, none of that was present when he cooked. It was as if a completely different person took over. "Shinji?"  
他没有注意到明日香站在他身后，观察着他的一举一动。她已经穿好衣服，闻到厨房里传来令人垂涎欲滴的香味。看着他在烹饪艺术上的娴熟技巧，她平时尖酸刻薄的开口评论迅速消散。他看起来如此...自信。害羞、冷漠，这些在他烹饪时都不复存在。仿佛完全换了个人似的。"真嗣？"  
  
The young man jumped, nearly knocking over a glass. "Don't DO that to me, you scared the hell out of me!"  
年轻人吓了一跳，差点打翻了杯子。“别这样吓我，你真是把我吓坏了！”  
  
Turning, he saw Asuka standing there, a somewhat slack-jawed expression on her face. "What?"  
他转过身，看到明日香站在那里，脸上带着些许惊讶的表情。“怎么了？”  
  
"You...you didn't apologize..."  
“你...你还没道歉...”  
  
Shinji opened his mouth to argue, when he realized she was right. Normally, he would apologize to a lamppost, if he thought he'd offended it. But he'd just...yelled...at Asuka.  
真嗣张嘴想要争辩，随即意识到她是对的。通常情况下，如果他认为自己冒犯了一根电线杆，他都会道歉。但他刚刚……对明日香大吼大叫了。  
  
More to the point, he'd yelled at Asuka, the "Red Headed Devil" Soryu, and lived.  
更关键的是，他对明日香，那个“红发魔女”惣流大吼了一通，居然还活着。  
  
Something was definitely strange here.  
这里肯定有什么不对劲的地方。  
  
The sound of a lid clattering on an overflowing pot brought him back to his senses. Shinji turned, taking the top from the pot with the noodles, preventing the water from boiling over. Asuka watched this with a bemused expression on her face. There was something about Shinji actually showing some spine by yelling at her that she found...attractive.  
锅盖在溢出的水面上咣当一声，将他拉回了现实。真嗣转身，从装满面条的锅中拿起盖子，防止水沸腾溢出。明日香带着一丝玩味的表情看着这一幕。真嗣居然敢对她大吼，这种展现出的骨气让她觉得……很有吸引力。  
  
Shinji turned the burner down, the noodles weren't quite done yet. Replacing the lid, he turned back to the redhead, to find her with a predatory smile on her face. This sent a pang of fear through his body, as he remembered what had transpired last time she had worn that expression. He could practically feel his nose being squeezed shut as her lips-  
真嗣调低了炉火，面条还没完全煮熟。他重新盖上锅盖，转头看向红发的她，却发现她脸上挂着狩猎般的微笑。这让他心中一紧，想起了上次她露出这种表情时发生的事情。他几乎能感觉到自己的鼻子被她的嘴唇——  
  
"Hello?" “你好？”  
  
Hearing her speak snapped him out of his reviere. "What?" he snapped. She had interrupted him at his favorite part.  
听到她说话，他猛地从沉思中惊醒。“什么？”他厉声问道。她打断了他最喜欢的地方。  
  
Asuka gaped. He'd yelled at her twice, now. Oh yes, she liked this Ikari much better than the usual whiny, weak, wussy Shinji she was used to dealing with. "Whatever this is, it smells great, so you better hurry up with it, or I might get...bored...again."  
明日香目瞪口呆。他现在对她吼了两次。哦，是的，她更喜欢这个碇真嗣，而不是她习惯应付的那个爱哭、软弱、娘娘腔的碇真嗣。“不管这是什么，闻起来很香，所以你最好快点，不然我可能会……再次感到无聊。”  
  
With that, she turned on her heel, and strode from the kitchen, leaving a speechless Shinji staring after her.  
说完，她转身大步走出厨房，留下一个哑口无言的真嗣呆呆地望着她的背影。

Misato Katsuragi entered the apartment fully expecting her two juvenile roomates to be arguing full-tilt. What greeted her, however, was a bit of a surprise, even for the battle-hardened Major.  
葛城美里走进公寓，满心以为她的两个未成年室友会吵得不可开交。然而，迎接她的却是一幕出乎意料的景象，即便是久经沙场的大佐也感到意外。  
  
Asuka was sitting quietly at the table, waiting for Shinji to finish the wonderful-smelling food he was preparing. She wasn't yelling at him, wasn't calling him 'Stupid Shinji', or, the more common 'Baka!'.  
明日香安静地坐在桌旁，等待着真嗣完成他正在准备的那道香气扑鼻的食物。她没有对他大喊大叫，没有叫他‘笨蛋真嗣’，也没有更常见的‘八嘎！’。  
  
And Shinji... 而真嗣...  
  
Shinji Ikari was confidently moving about the small kitchen, acting as if the entire place belonged to him, rather than just the room he slept in. His hands moved with skill and precision, almost without him even looking. It was as if he was piloting, except without the anger, without the sorrow. This was a joy for him, and it clearly showed.  
碇真嗣自信地在狭小的厨房里忙碌着，仿佛整个地方都属于他，而不仅仅是他睡觉的房间。他的双手熟练而精准地移动，几乎不需要看。这就像他在驾驶，只是没有了愤怒，没有了悲伤。这对他来说是一种乐趣，这一点显而易见。  
  
"Ahem." “咳咳。”  
  
The two Children looked up, Asuka from her magazine, and Shinji from the stove, where the alfredo sauce was just about done. "Yes, Misato?" they both echoed in unison, a flashback to their synch training.  
两个孩子抬起头，明日香从她的杂志上，真嗣从炉子旁，那里阿尔弗雷多酱汁刚刚好。“是的，美里？”他们异口同声地回应，让人回想起他们的同步训练。  
  
She fought the urge to shudder. This was getting to be more than a little creepy. "Shin-kun, what's this?" she asked, dipping a finger into the saucepan.  
她强忍住颤抖的冲动。这情况变得越来越诡异了。“真嗣君，这是什么？”她问道，用手指蘸了蘸平底锅里的东西。  
  
Shinji tried to stop her, but it was too little, too late. Misato yanked her finger from the bubbling liquid, cursing herself for her stupidity. Shinji sighed, taking her hand, and placing it under the faucet. Turning the cold water on, he held her burnt finger under the cool stream, soothing the pain. After a moment, she removed the afflicted digit from the sink, opting to suck on the tip instead. Shinji tried not to look at the way her lips were wrapped around the injured finger. "It's fetticine alfredo, Misato-san. If you would wait, I'll have it ready in a few minutes."  
真嗣试图阻止她，但为时已晚。美里猛地从沸腾的液体中抽出手指，咒骂自己的愚蠢。真嗣叹了口气，握住她的手，放在水龙头下。他打开冷水，让她的烫伤手指在清凉的水流下缓解疼痛。过了一会儿，她从水槽中抽出受伤的手指，改为吮吸指尖。真嗣尽量不去看她嘴唇包裹着受伤手指的样子。“这是意大利面阿尔弗雷多，美里小姐。如果你能稍等一下，我几分钟就能做好。”  
  
"You'd better," Asuka piped up, "Because the longer I wait, the more bored I get..."  
“你最好快点，”明日香插话道，“因为我等得越久，就越无聊……”  
  
Shinji turned to the stove, trying to hide the blush that had crept up on his face.  
真嗣转向炉灶，试图掩饰脸上蔓延的红晕。  
***  
Several minutes later, dinner was finally set. Shinji dished out a helping of noodles, and added the sauce. he then served himself, sitting back and waiting for the two women to try the dish.  
几分钟后，晚餐终于准备好了。真嗣盛出一碗面条，加上酱汁，然后给自己也盛了一份，坐回去等待两位女士品尝这道菜。  
  
Asuka didn't hesitate, spooling up a forkful and taking a big bite. She closed here eyes, savoring the creamy taste of the sauce and the perfectly cooked noodles. This was the best thing she had tastyed in a long time.  
明日香毫不犹豫，卷起一叉面条，大口咬下。她闭上眼睛，细细品味着酱汁的浓郁和面条的完美熟度。这是她很久以来尝过的最美味的佳肴。  
  
Misato, seeing Asuka's determination, took a bite of her own serving. She chewed slowly, letting the flavors speak for themselves, a testament to the young man's skill in the kitchen. Shinji would definitely have to cook like this more often. "Shin-kun, this is excellent! Where did you learn to cook like this?"  
美里看着明日香坚定的样子，也尝了一口自己的那份。她慢慢咀嚼，让味道自己说话，这证明了年轻人在厨房里的技艺。真嗣肯定得经常这样做饭。“真-君，这太棒了！你是从哪儿学会这样做饭的？”  
  
He rolled his eyes. "Where do you think? I'm the only one around here that does cook, thankfully." He took a bite himself. "Not bad. The sauce needed a bit more cheese."  
他翻了个白眼。“你以为呢？幸好这里只有我会做饭。”他自己也尝了一口。“不错。酱汁需要再多加点奶酪。”  
  
Asuka, meanwhile, still eating, was looking at the young man with a sense of amamzement. "Who the hell are you, and what have you done with Baka-Shinji?" she inquired mildly.  
与此同时，明日香还在吃，她带着一种惊奇的目光看着年轻人。“你到底是谁，把笨蛋真嗣怎么了？”她温和地问道。  
  
His expression fell a bit at that. For a moment, Asuka could see the old Ikari, the apologetic boy who was sorry for everything he did. He recomposed himself, though, and the confident Shinji was back again.  
听到这话，他的表情有些黯淡。有那么一瞬，明日香看到了旧时的碇真嗣，那个为所做的一切道歉的男孩。但他很快调整过来，自信的真嗣又回来了。  
  
"I'm still the same Shinji, I just like to cook."  
“我还是那个真嗣，只是喜欢做饭。”  
  
"I'm glad to hear it."  
“很高兴听你这么说。”  
  
Both Children looked to their guardian. She had finished her plate, and was dabbing at her lips with a napkin, something she would normally never do. "Because I think that it's time that Asuka learned how to cook."  
两个孩子都看向他们的监护人。她已经吃完了盘中的食物，正用纸巾轻按嘴唇，这在平时她是绝不会做的。“因为我认为是时候让明日香学会做饭了。”  
  
A stunned silence descended over the room. Asuka was the first one to break it. "I don't NEED to know how to cook , that's what Shinji is for!" She stood, resting her hands on her hips. And there is no way that I would allow this weakling to teach me how to cook!"  
房间里陷入了一片震惊的沉默。明日香是第一个打破沉默的人。“我不需要知道怎么做饭，那是真嗣的事！”她站起身，双手叉腰。“我绝不会让这个弱者教我做饭！”  
  
Misato gave Asuka a skeptical look. She had lived with the German girl for long enough to know when her rants were genuine, and this was most definitely not one of them. "Asuka, step into the other room with me." Her tone left no room for argument. The two females left Shinji sitting there, a puzzled expression on his face.  
美里给了明日香一个怀疑的眼神。她和这个德国女孩同住已久，足以分辨出她的咆哮何时是认真的，而这次显然不是。“明日香，跟我到另一个房间来。”她的语气不容反驳。两个女性离开后，真嗣坐在那里，脸上带着困惑的表情。  
***  
Misato pointed to the couch. "Sit."  
美里指着沙发。“坐。”  
  
Asuka sat. 明日香坐下了。  
  
Misato gave her a look. Now there are the looks that mean trouble, and the looks that mean...*trouble* This was a *trouble* look.  
美里看了她一眼。眼神有表示麻烦的，也有表示……*麻烦*的。这是*麻烦*的眼神。  
  
"Ok, what's going on between you and Shinji?"  
“好吧，你和真嗣之间发生了什么？”  
  
Asuka looked at the floor. "I...it's like he's a different person in the kitchen! He actually *yelled* at me today! Twice! And I didn't kill him!"  
明日香看着地板。“我……他在厨房里简直像变了个人！他今天居然对我*吼*了！两次！而我竟然没杀了他！”  
  
The older woman nodded sageley. This was to be expected, and in fact, it was what she had suspected through dinner. Asuka had kept sneaking looks at the boy when she thought Misato wasn't looking. Of course, Misato was paying far more attention than she appeared to be, and knew about the glances, the furtive peeks.  
年长的女人睿智地点点头。这是预料之中的事，实际上，这也是她在晚餐时所怀疑的。明日香一直在偷偷看那个男孩，以为美里没注意到。当然，美里比她表面上看起来要关注得多，她注意到了那些目光，那些偷偷的窥视。  
  
This was going to be fun.  
这将会很有趣。  
  
"Ok, Second Child. I can either help you, or make this harder than it's already going to be."  
“好吧，第二适格者。我可以帮你，或者让这已经够难的事情变得更难。”  
  
Asuka looked up, catching Misato's eye. "And what makes you think that I need your help."  
明日香抬头，与美里对视。“你凭什么认为我需要你的帮助？”  
  
Something in the return look made Asuka shiver. "Because if I suspect that you're toying with him, or doing this out of spite, I'm going to make your life a living hell. And don't think i can't, either."  
阿斯克的眼神让明日香打了个寒颤。“因为如果我怀疑你在玩弄他，或者出于怨恨这么做，我会让你的生活变成活生生的地狱。别以为我做不到。”  
  
Misato turned, leaving the room.  
美里转身离开了房间。  
***  
Shinji looked up as Asuka entered the kitchen. "What was that all about?"  
真嗣抬头看着明日香走进厨房。“那是什么意思？”  
  
"Never mind, Third Child. Would you like some help cleaning up?"  
“没关系，三号机驾驶员。需要帮忙清理一下吗？”  
  
He immediately went on guard. Asuka Soryu *never* offered help. "Uh, sure. You can start clearing the table."  
他立刻警觉起来。惣流·明日香·兰格雷*从不*主动帮忙。“呃，当然。你可以开始收拾桌子。”  
  
The young man began to wash the dishes, as Asuka handed them to him. This was something completely unexpected, and also something to be wary of.  
年轻人开始洗碗，而明日香则把碗递给他。这完全出乎意料，也是需要警惕的事情。  
  
"Umm...what do you like to eat?"  
"嗯...你喜欢吃什么？"  
  
Asuka looked at him as if he was crazy. Shinji Ikari didn't make small talk. "Well, I suppose that I like Italian now." she said, a smile gracing her visage.  
明日香看着他，仿佛他疯了一样。碇真嗣从不闲聊。“好吧，我想我现在喜欢意大利菜。”她微笑着说，脸上露出了笑容。  
  
Shinji turned to face her, catching the smile. He gave her a small one in return.  
真嗣转过身来面对她，捕捉到了她的微笑。他回以一个淡淡的微笑。  
  
"Good." “好。”  
***  
Later on that evening, Shinji sat in his room, going through a cookbook. He had wanted to find a good recipe to start teaching Asuka. However, he wasn't even sure how he would teach her even after finding a suitable first lesson. She was so...stubborn. And if past incidents were any indication, it would be a long, uphill battle just getting her to listen to him.  
那天晚上晚些时候，真嗣坐在自己的房间里翻阅着一本食谱。他想找一道好菜谱来开始教明日香。然而，即便找到了合适的入门课程，他也不确定该如何教她。她太...固执了。而且，从以往的事件来看，光是让她听他说话就是一场漫长而艰难的斗争。  
  
Flipping through the pages, he saw many simple recipes, but nothing that seemed...right...for a beginner. Especially one that had already graduated college. He didn't want to patronize her, yet he wanted to show her that *he* would be the one in charge. Earlier, when he had inadvertently yelled at her, something had passed through her eyes, something he had never expected to see there.  
他翻阅着书页，看到了许多简单的食谱，但似乎没有哪个...适合...初学者。尤其是已经大学毕业的她。他不想轻视她，却又想让她明白，*他*才是主导者。早些时候，当他无意中对她大吼时，她的眼中闪过了一丝他从未预料到的情绪。  
  
Respect. 尊重。  
  
It had only been for an instant, but it *had* been there, nonetheless. Shinji wanted more, wanted to be respected by her so badly it hurt.  
那仅仅是一瞬间的事，但它的确存在过。真嗣渴望更多，渴望得到她的尊重，这种渴望强烈到让他感到痛苦。  
  
And now, maybe he could be.  
而现在，或许他可以实现这个愿望了。  
***  
Asuka was going through a similar struggle in her room. As much as she despised her roomate, there was no denying that he had his...appealing qualities.  
明日香在自己的房间里经历着类似的挣扎。尽管她对室友深恶痛绝，但不得不承认他确实有他那...吸引人的特质。  
  
Having gone to college, she had had more than her fair share of male attention. However, after discovering that most of them wanted nothing more than to get her in bed, she began to act like she currently did. As a result, none of the boys here had ever asked her out, more or less yelled at her.  
上了大学后，她已经受够了男生的关注。然而，当她发现他们大多只是想把她弄上床时，她开始表现得像现在这样。结果，这里的男生们从未有人约过她，更别提对她大喊大叫了。  
  
It was a new experience. After being the dominating one for so long, it was a refreshing change to not be in charge. Asuka actually found that she quite enjoyed it when Shinji showed a little backbone. And his cooking...  
这是一种全新的体验。长久以来一直处于主导地位的她，突然不再掌权，这种变化令人耳目一新。明日香发现自己其实挺喜欢真嗣展现出一点骨气的时候。还有他的厨艺...  
  
She found herself nearly drooling at the thought of another dinner prepared by him. Shinji might not have been the best looking guy she'd been around, but he certainly was the most proficient in the kitchen. Even during her stay with Kaji, she'd never eaten so well, as the perpetually unshaven man seemed to never have the time to cook, instead ordering out on a nearly daily basis. Of course, as a result of this, Asuka never learned how to cook for herself either.  
她发现自己一想到他准备的另一顿晚餐就几乎要流口水了。真嗣可能不是她见过的最帅气的男生，但他在厨房里的确是最拿手的。即使在和加持同住期间，她也从未吃得这么好，那个永远胡子拉碴的男人似乎总是没时间做饭，几乎每天都叫外卖。当然，正因为如此，明日香也从未学会如何为自己烹饪。  
  
But now that Shinji would be teaching her...  
但现在真嗣要教她了……  
  
She tried to supress the evil grin that crept up on her otherwise angelic face. She really did. As much as she attempted to tell herself that she would behave, she knew far too well that this was going to be a lot of fun.  
她试图压制住那抹在她天使般面容上悄然爬升的邪恶笑容。她真的尽力了。尽管她一再告诉自己要规矩，但她太清楚这将会非常有趣。  
***The Next Morning*** ***次日早晨***  
The alarm went off, and a hand reached out from the tangle of covers to silence it's inhuman noise. After slapping the snooze button, the occupant of the futon rolled over, trying in vain to go back to sleep. Today was Saturday, after all, and there were no test scheduled at headquarters, so there was no good reason to get up yet.  
闹钟响起，一只手从乱糟糟的被窝中伸出，试图平息这不人道的噪音。按下贪睡按钮后，睡在蒲团上的人翻了个身，徒劳地试图再次入睡。毕竟今天是星期六，总部也没有安排测试，所以没有理由这么早起床。  
  
But habits die hard, so Shinji got up anyway, thinking that at the least, he could have a quiet breakfast. Rolling out of his bed, he pulled on a fresh pair of slacks, and a t-shirt, one of the few that he owned. Forgoing socks and shoes, he left his room, heading for the kitchen.  
但习惯难改，真嗣还是起床了，心想至少可以安静地吃个早餐。他从床上滚下来，穿上一条干净的裤子，和一件 T 恤，这是他仅有的几件之一。没穿袜子和鞋子，他离开了房间，朝厨房走去。  
  
What he saw there made him pinch himself to ensure that he was indeed awake, and not merely sleepwalking.  
他所见之景让他不禁捏了自己一把，以确认自己确实醒着，而非梦游。  
  
Asuka Langley Soryu was quietly fixing her own breakfast. Or rather, attempting to. The kitchen looked like an Evangelion had rampaged through it, dirtiying seemingly every clean plate, and leaving no countertop untouched. If Shinji was seeing everything correctly, it appeared that the young woman was trying to make pancakes.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷正安静地准备自己的早餐。或者更确切地说，是试图准备。厨房看起来像是被 EVA 肆虐过一般，似乎每个干净的盘子都被弄脏了，没有一个台面幸免于难。如果真嗣的观察无误，这位年轻女子似乎是在尝试做煎饼。  
  
Shinji rarely made these, but he knew how, and they didn't require nearly so many pots, pans, plates, spoons, or bowls as Asuka had used so far. He stood there, watching her carefully measure out batter into a bowl, only to quietly curse the inanimate object in German when it didn't quite do what she wanted it to. A smile crept across his face as he realized how attractive she was when she wasn't actively screaming at him.  
真嗣很少做这些，但他知道怎么做，而且不需要像明日香目前所用的那么多锅碗瓢盆。他站在那里，看着她小心翼翼地将面糊量入碗中，却用德语低声咒骂那无生命的物体，因为它没有完全按照她的意愿行事。当他意识到她在不对自己大吼大叫时是多么迷人时，一丝微笑爬上了他的脸庞。  
  
Asuka finally managed to get the batter into one bowl without spilling most of it, and she set the mix down, turning to see her roomate regarding her with a bemused smile on his face. "Morning, Asuka."  
明日香终于成功地将面糊倒入一个碗中，没有洒出太多，她放下混合物，转身看到室友正带着一丝戏谑的微笑看着她。“早上好，明日香。”  
  
She started, her startled eyes quickly narrowing as she scowled at him. "How long have you been standing there?"  
她吓了一跳，惊讶的眼睛迅速眯起，皱着眉头瞪向他。“你站在那里多久了？”  
  
"Long enough to see that you're not so bad in the kitchen."  
“足够久，久到看出你在厨房里其实并不赖。”  
  
The compliment took her off guard. Shinji would normally never say anything like that to her, for fear of bodily harm. "Is that right, Third Child?" she asked in a sultry voice.  
这番夸赞让她措手不及。真嗣通常绝不会对她说这样的话，唯恐招致身体伤害。“是吗，第三适格者？”她用撩人的声音问道。  
  
The young man had to mightily fight off thoughts of Asuka in an apron, and nothing else. It wasn't easy. "Well, I figured that I would fix breakfast, but you already seem to have that covered." He replied, a slight blush betraying him nonetheless.  
年轻人不得不拼命驱散脑海中明日香只穿着围裙的形象，这并不容易。“嗯，我本来想做早餐的，但你似乎已经搞定了。”他回答道，尽管如此，脸颊上的微红还是出卖了他。  
  
Asuka took immediate note of this, however. "Just because I can cook pancakes doesn't mean that you can be lazy all the time, Third," she shot back, hands on her hips. "After all, *you're* supposed to be teaching *me* how to cook, remember?"  
然而，明日香立刻注意到了这一点。“我会做煎饼并不意味着你可以一直偷懒，第三适格者，”她双手叉腰回击道，“毕竟，应该是你教我做饭，记得吗？”  
  
He fough back a snicker that would probably get him beaten later. "Not like this, I can't. There aren't any clean dishes or pans left in the apartment, I'm betting..."  
他强忍住可能会招致晚些时候挨打的窃笑。“不是这样的，我没法做。我敢打赌，公寓里已经没有干净的盘子或平底锅了……”  
  
The firey girl's jaw dropped slightly. Shinji was...teasing her?  
火辣女孩的下巴微微张开。真嗣他……在逗她？  
  
Shinji, meanwhile, mistaking the look on her face for anger, quickly cast his eyes downward. "Sorry, Asuka."  
与此同时，真嗣误以为她脸上的表情是愤怒，迅速垂下目光。“对不起，明日香。”  
  
Her expression gentled somewhat. "It's okay, Shinji. I'm jsut not used to hearing complements, that's all."  
她的表情稍微柔和了一些。“没事的，真嗣。我只是不太习惯听到赞美，仅此而已。”  
  
It was his turn to be stunned. "What? You, the prettiest girl in Tokyo-3?"  
轮到他愣住了。“什么？你，东京-3 最漂亮的女孩？”  
  
She blushed, much to her chargrin.  
她脸红了，对此颇为懊恼。  
***  
Later on, after washing many dishes, and wiping down many surfaces, breakfast was finally ready.  
后来，在洗了许多盘子，擦了许多表面之后，早餐终于准备好了。  
  
Shinji sat down, taking a plate and one of the pile of pancakes that Asuka had fixed. Adding syrup, he took a bite, tasting what was her first attepmt at cooking since she moved in.  
真嗣坐下来，拿起一个盘子和一堆由明日香做的煎饼中的一张。加上糖浆，他咬了一口，品尝着这是她搬进来后的第一次烹饪尝试。  
  
The taste wasn't quite right, but it was better than he expected. Perhaps this wouldn't be as hard as he thought. "Not bad, Asuka, not bad at all."  
味道不太对劲，但比他预期的要好。也许这不会像他想的那么难。“不错啊，明日香，真的很不错。”  
  
She beamed, throwing a genuine smile across the table at him.  
她展颜一笑，隔着桌子向他投去一个真诚的微笑。

---
After breakfast was cleaned up, (By Shinji, of course) Asuka asked him what he was going to teach her how to make.  
早餐收拾完毕后（当然是真嗣做的），明日香问他打算教她做什么。

The apron-clad boy grinned.  "It's a surprise, Asuka.  We have a lot of preparation to do for this.  As soon as we're finished here, we're going shopping."  
系着围裙的男孩咧嘴一笑。“这是个惊喜，明日香。我们为此有很多准备工作要做。我们一结束这里的事，就去购物。”

The redhead's ears perked up at this.  "Shopping?"  
听到这个，红发女孩的耳朵竖了起来。“购物？”

"Not the way you think.  We have to go to several specialty stores for the ingredients.  But I promise you'll like it when it's done."  
“不是你想的那样。我们得去几家专卖店买材料。但我保证你尝了会喜欢的。”

With that, he finished the last of the dishes, hung up the apron, and went to his room to change.  Asuka grabbed him on his way out of the kitchen, spinning him around to tell him something.  As she did so, he turned a little faster than she expected, and as a result they ended up about an inch from each other.  Asuka couldn't help but notice the deep blue color of Shinji's eyes, and breathing became a rather difficult process for her.  In fact, she forgot what she wanted to tell him entirely.  
说完，他收拾完最后几道菜，挂起围裙，回房间换衣服。在真嗣走出厨房的路上，明日香抓住他，想告诉他些什么。她这么一转，他转身比她预想的快了些，结果两人差点撞上。明日香不禁注意到真嗣深蓝色的眼睛，呼吸变得有些困难。事实上，她完全忘了自己想说什么。

Shinji, whether through some miracle of understanding on his part, or just plain dumb luck, managed to play it cool.  He leaned in, so that his lips were almost touching her ear, and whispered, "I'll give you a hint, Asuka-chan.  It's going to be sweet.  Like you."  
真嗣，无论是出于某种奇迹般的理解，还是纯粹的幸运，表现得相当镇定。他倾身向前，嘴唇几乎触碰到她的耳边，低声说：“给你个提示，明日香。会是很甜的。就像你一样。”

And with this, the Third Child turned and went to his room, leaving a blushing young girl in his wake.  
就这样，第三适格者转身走向自己的房间，留下一个脸红的少女在他身后。

***

Shinji shut the door behind him, and had to grasp onto the knob to keep his legs under him.  
真嗣关上身后的门，不得不抓住门把手来稳住自己的双腿。

 _I can't believe I just did that!  
我简直不敢相信我刚刚那么做了！_

 He had actually whispered in her ear, and she hadn't killed him.  But what really weakened his knees was the smell of her hair.  The scents of green tea and a hint of jasmine were intoxicating.  And if he was going to be teaching her how to cook in the apartment's tiny kitchen, he was going to smell a lot more of it...  
他真的在她耳边低语了，而她并没有杀了他。但真正让他膝盖发软的，是她头发的香气。绿茶的清香和一丝茉莉的淡雅令人陶醉。如果他要在公寓的小厨房里教她做饭，他将会闻到更多这样的香气……

With an effort, he put his thoughts back on track.  This was neither the time nor the place to lose focus on what he was planning on doing.  He had a lot to do today, and he was going to need all the concentration he could muster.  
他努力让自己的思绪回到正轨。现在既不是时候也不是地方失去对计划的专注。他今天有很多事情要做，需要集中全部注意力。

The recipe he had selected was quite different from anything he had ever attempted, but he was sure that he could handle it.  He had made his choice based on what he thought Asuka's tastes might gravitate towards, as well as the difficulty involved.  It wasn't a particularly hard recipe, but at the same time, it wasn't so easy as to be insulting to her intelligence.  An angry Asuka was about as bad as a frustrated one, so teaching her anything was going to be a delicate process.  
他挑选的食谱与他以往尝试过的任何东西都截然不同，但他确信自己能应付。他的选择基于他认为明日香可能会喜欢的口味，以及难度。这不是一个特别难的食谱，但同时，也不至于简单到侮辱她的智商。一个生气的明日香和一个受挫的明日香一样糟糕，所以教她任何东西都将是一个微妙的过程。

Pulling out the cookbook, he began to make a shopping list.  
他拿出食谱，开始列购物清单。

Asuka hadn't moved from where Shinji had left her.  Her heart was still racing, as she recalled how close he had been, how blue his eyes were.  She had felt his breath on her ear as he had whispered into it.  The sensation was new to her, and the reaction to it completely unexpected.  
明日香还坐在真嗣离开她的地方。她的心跳依旧急促，回想起他离得那么近，他的眼睛是那么蓝。她能感觉到他的呼吸拂过她的耳畔，当他对着她的耳朵低语时。这种感觉对她来说是全新的，而她的反应完全出乎意料。

_Shinji…what's happened to you?  
真嗣……你发生了什么？_

"Hey, let's go." “嘿，我们走吧。”

Asuka was abruptly snapped out of her daze by the request of the Third Child.  Shinji stood outside his room, jacket in hand.  "Are you ready?  We have to go shopping for tonight."  
明日香被第三适格者的请求突然从恍惚中拉回现实。真嗣站在他的房间外，手里拿着夹克。“你准备好了吗？我们得去买今晚的东西。”

In a corner of her mind, she vaguely noted that the Shinji she knew would never be so bold.  One part of her was unnerved by him, while another was…something else.  Not scared, but something she couldn't quite place.  "Tonight?"  
在她内心的一角，她隐约注意到她所认识的真嗣绝不会如此大胆。一方面她对他感到不安，而另一方面则是……某种其他的感觉。不是害怕，而是某种她无法确切描述的感觉。“今晚？”

Shinji rolled his eyes.  "Yes, tonight.  I'm giving my first lesson in cooking, per Misato's orders.  Or did you forget?"  
真嗣翻了个白眼。“是的，今晚。按照美里小姐的命令，我要上我的第一堂烹饪课。还是你忘了？”

Her eyes narrowed.  But before she could let loose a choice stream of insults, the phone rang.   
她的眼睛眯了起来。但在她能吐出一连串尖刻的侮辱之前，电话响了。

Shinji held up a hand.  "I'll get it."  He picked it up. "Hello?....yes….yes, I understand….bye."  
真嗣举起一只手。“我来接。”他拿起电话。“喂？……是的……是的，我明白了……再见。”

Shinji placed the handset back on the hook, his eyes taking on a distant look.  He looked…troubled by something that the caller had told him.  "What is it?"  
真嗣将听筒放回挂钩上，眼神变得遥远。他看起来……被来电者告诉他的事情困扰着。“怎么了？”

He turned to Asuka, who was standing there expectantly, arms crossed over her breasts, eyebrow raised.  It was her classic 'superiority' pose.  "That was Misato, she said that Kaji and she were going out tonight, so we're on our own for dinner."  
他转向明日香，她正站在那里期待地看着，双臂交叉在胸前，眉毛上扬。这是她经典的“优越”姿态。“那是美里小姐，她说她和加持今晚要出去，所以晚餐我们得自己解决了。”

Asuka stood there, looking as if she hadn't quite heard him correctly.  "…Alone?"  
明日香站在那里，似乎还没完全听明白他的话。“……单独？”

"That's about the gist of it.  Come on, we need to get going if we're going to get everything we'll need."  
“大致就是这样。快点，我们得抓紧时间，才能准备好所有需要的东西。”

With this, he grabbed her hand, pulling her out the door with him.  Asuka had little choice but to comply, as she was too shocked to do anything about the formerly spineless Shinji who was currently dragging her off to parts unknown.  
说着，他抓住她的手，拉着她一起出了门。明日香别无选择，只能顺从，她太过震惊，无法对那个曾经胆小如鼠的碇真嗣现在正拖着她去往未知之地做出任何反应。

A half hour later found them on a train, bound for the far side of Tokyo-3.  Asuka had asked Shinji where they were going, to no avail.  All he would say was "Trust me," and continue looking out the window.  She sat across the aisle from him, explaining that there was no was that she was going to sit next to such a pervert.  
半小时后，他们坐上了开往第三新东京市远郊的列车。明日香问真嗣他们要去哪里，但毫无结果。他只是说“相信我”，然后继续望向窗外。她坐在过道的对面，解释说她绝不会坐在这样一个变态旁边。

So she sat, looking at him, trying to decipher the mystery that was the Third Child.  She could think of nothing that would explain his drastic changes form his usual behavior, and this intrigued her.   
于是她坐下，凝视着他，试图解开这位第三适格者身上的谜团。她想不出任何能解释他行为剧变的原因，这让她感到十分好奇。

As she gazed at him, thinking she was doing so unnoticed, Shinji's eyes, seemingly looking out the window, were in actuality, focused on the reflection of the red-headed girl sitting across from him.  Positioned thus, he was able to see her expression as it truly was, and not the mask she seemed to present to him whenever they were face to face.  He noted that her face held none of the condescendence that it normally did, instead having an almost childlike expression of wonder and curiosity.   
当她以为自己未被察觉地注视着他时，实际上，看似望向窗外的真嗣的眼睛，正聚焦在对面红发女孩的倒影上。就这样，他能够看到她真实的表情，而不是她面对他时似乎戴上的面具。他注意到，她的脸上没有平时那种居高临下的神情，取而代之的是一种近乎孩童般的好奇和惊奇。

He suppressed a smile.  Were she to be made aware that he was in fact watching her as she looked at him, she would likely pound him into a pulp, and them leave him on the train.  So he continued to appear as if he was lost in thought, while reflecting that Asuka was indeed beautiful when she wasn't screaming at the top of her lungs.  The way her hair fell down her back, a silken waterfall of crimson, the scent of which made him weak kneed.  The way her full lips curved upward in a gentle smile, which made his heart beat faster every time he saw it.  The blue of her eyes, a crystal blue that pulled him in every time he gazed into them, threatening to pull him under.   
他强忍住笑意。如果她知道他实际上正在看她，而她正看着他，她很可能会把他揍成一团，然后把他留在火车上。所以他继续装作若有所思的样子，同时心里想着，明香确实很美，当她不尖声叫喊的时候。她的头发如丝般垂落背后，像一道鲜红的瀑布，那香气让他膝盖发软。她丰满的嘴唇轻轻上扬，露出温柔的微笑，每次看到都让他的心跳加速。她眼睛的蓝色，清澈如水晶，每次凝视都让他深陷其中，仿佛要将他吞没。

Shinji allowed a slight smile to creep onto his face as he turned to her.  Immediately her face assumed it's normal expression concerning the Evangelion Pilot: a look of complete and utter disdain.  Normally, it would have hurt him.  But he had watched Asuka when she thought he wasn't looking, and he knew that the face he was seeing now wasn't the one she had presented to him just a few minutes ago.  "Do you think you're ready?"  
真嗣转头看向她，脸上不禁露出一丝微笑。她立刻摆出了对待福音战士驾驶员的常态表情：一脸的彻底鄙视。通常，这会让他受伤。但他曾在她以为他没在看的时候观察过她，他知道现在看到的这张脸，并不是几分钟前她展现给他的那张。“你觉得自己准备好了吗？”

Asuka smirked, a trademark curling of her upper lip as if to say, 'Are you kidding?' I am the Great Asuka Langley Soryu, Baka Shinji.  I can do anything you can."  
明日香微微一笑，那标志性的上唇翘起，仿佛在说：‘你在开玩笑吗？’我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，笨蛋真嗣。我能做到你所能做的一切。

_Is that so?_ He thought, all the time smiling at her.  Her smirk faded somewhat as he didn't lower his head as he normally would after one of her barbs.  "I'll have you know that cooking isn't just a skill, it's a form of art.  It's not something that you can just jump into and learn by watching.  So if you think that tonight is going to be you bossing me around, you are sorely mistaken."  
是吗？他心想，脸上始终保持着微笑。她的讥笑稍稍淡去，因为他并没有像往常那样在她的一番嘲讽后低下头。“你得知道，烹饪不仅仅是一项技能，它是一种艺术形式。这不是你随便跳进去看看就能学会的。所以如果你以为今晚会是你对我指手画脚，那你就大错特错了。

Her jaw dropped, aghast at this overt display of authority.  "W-w-what!?" she sputtered, momentarily thrown off track by his seemingly growing a spine out of nowhere.  
她的下巴掉了下来，对这公然的权威展示感到震惊。“什-什-什么！？”她结巴道，一时被他突然长出的脊梁骨打乱了阵脚。

Shinji took a small pleasure in the fact that he had just rendered her somewhat speechless. _How I wish I could have done this months ago…  "You _are going to be learning, which means you're going to get your hands dirty.  You will mix, and blend, and stir, and whip, and when all is said and done, you will help clean up, because that's the difference between a chef and a cook.__  
"真嗣心中暗自得意，因为他刚刚让她有些哑口无言。我多么希望几个月前就能做到这一点……“你将要学习，这意味着你会弄脏双手。你要混合、调和、搅拌、打发，而当一切完成后，你还要帮忙清理，因为这就是厨师和厨子的区别。”

__

She blinked at him.  "The difference being?"  
她眨眼看着他。“区别在于？”

Shinji gave her a tight smile.  "Anyone can be a chef, Asuka, because a chef has someone to clean up after him.  He takes no pleasure in his work, because most of the time, it isn't himself he's cooking for, but rather someone else.  A cook, on the other hand, cleans up after himself, and puts everything into his cooking, because its himself he's making food for."  
真嗣对她露出了一个紧绷的微笑。“任何人都可以成为厨师，明日香，因为厨师有人替他收拾残局。他对自己的工作并不感到快乐，因为大多数时候，他不是为自己烹饪，而是为别人。而厨子则自己清理，全身心投入烹饪，因为他是为自己做食物。”

Asuka had no time to argue, as the train came to a halt at the station.  Shinji rose, beckoning her to follow, as he led off.   
明日香没有时间争论，因为火车在车站停了下来。真嗣站起身，示意她跟上，然后领头离开。

Several hours later, and two full bags of groceries, they stopped at a small café to have a drink before heading back home to begin.  Shinji suggested it, knowing that he would need something to calm his nerves.  Tonight was going to be a new experience, for both of them, and Shinji was in no mood to deal with a frustrated or patronized Asuka.  
几个小时后，提着满满两袋杂货，他们在一家小咖啡馆停下来喝点东西，然后才回家开始。真嗣提议这样做，因为他知道自己需要一些东西来平复紧张的情绪。今晚对他们俩来说都将是一个全新的体验，真嗣没有心情去应付一个沮丧或被轻视的明日香。

He stepped up to the counter, smiling at the young woman behind it.  "I'll have a cup of green tea."  
他走到柜台前，对里面的年轻女子微笑道：“我要一杯绿茶。”

She returned his smile and entered the order.  "Will that be all?"  
她回以微笑，并下了订单。“就这些吗？”

"Whatever she orders, as well."  He stepped away, allowing Asuka a look at the selections.  A few minutes later, his tea was ready, and he took it, taking a small sip.  Perfect.  
“她点的也一起。”他退开一步，让明日香看看有哪些选择。几分钟后，他的茶准备好了，他接过茶，轻轻啜了一口。完美。

Asuka, meanwhile, was staring at the board, as if unsure what to order.  Shinji sipped his tea again, enjoying her indecision.  He waited a few more moments before speaking to the waitress.   
与此同时，明日香正盯着菜单，似乎拿不定主意。真嗣又啜了一口茶，享受着她的犹豫不决。他又等了一会儿，才对女服务员开口。

"She'll have a hot chocolate, touch of mint, and a hint of cinnamon."  
"她要点一杯热巧克力，加一点薄荷，再来一丝肉桂味。"

The German narrowed her eyes.  "What do you think you're doing?"  
德国人眯起了眼睛。“你以为你在做什么？”

"Ordering what you would have eventually ordered yourself."  
“点你最终也会自己点的那些。”

Asuka glared at him for a few more seconds, before taking her drink, and selecting a window seat at the far edge of the establishment, as far away from the Third Child as she could.  Shinji smirked, and took his own seat, by the bar, where he could observe her.  
明日香又瞪了他几秒钟，然后拿起自己的饮料，选了一个靠窗的座位，尽可能远离第三适格者。真嗣微微一笑，坐在吧台旁，以便观察她。

Asuka stared out the window, much as Shinji had done on the train on the way over here.  But again, like Shinji, she wasn't staring out, but rather looking at the reflection of the young man behind her.   
明日香凝视着窗外，就像真嗣在来这里的火车上所做的那样。但同样，像真嗣一样，她并非真的在看外面，而是在注视着身后那位年轻人的倒影。

_What's gotten into me?  I normally would pound him for doing something like that, and I barely even looked at him hard._  The fiery-haired young woman wasn't sure of the reasons behind her reticence to treat her roommate the way she normally did, but then again, she suspected that Shinji wasn't sure what to make of her newfound niceness, either.  
我这是怎么了？换作平时，他那样做我早就揍他了，今天却几乎没怎么瞪他。这位红发少女不确定自己为何对室友如此克制，但转念一想，她猜真嗣也不明白她为何突然变得这么友善。

So she sat, and observed him, sitting there, sipping his tea, his head no longer down, but upright, a confident expression on his face.  As she looked at him, she saw things, things she hadn't taken the time to notice before.  The way his bangs fell across his face, creating a neat kind of messiness that intrigued her, made him look mysterious.  The way his blue azure eyes took in everything around him, seeing all, and missing nothing.  A small part of her noted that that particular trait, he must have received from his mother; his father's eyes certainly held no warmth.   
于是她坐下，观察着他，坐在那里，啜饮着茶，头不再低垂，而是挺直，脸上带着自信的表情。当她注视着他时，她看到了一些东西，一些她之前没有花时间去注意的东西。他额前的刘海横扫过脸庞，形成了一种整齐的凌乱，这让她感到好奇，使他看起来神秘莫测。他那湛蓝的眼睛环视四周，洞察一切，无所遗漏。她心中有一小部分注意到，这一特质，他必定是从母亲那里继承来的；他父亲的眼睛显然没有那种温暖。

Asuka felt a warm sensation spreading along her cheeks, and she was glad that she was facing the window.  The blush let her know that she wasn't looking at Baka Shinji anymore, but rather, Shinji Ikari, a handsome, intelligent, talented young man, whom she happened to live with.  
明日香感到脸颊上蔓延着一股暖意，她庆幸自己正对着窗户。这抹红晕让她意识到，她不再看着笨蛋真嗣，而是看着真嗣·碇，一个英俊、聪明、有才华的年轻人，她恰好与他同住。

And on top of all that, he was going to teach her how to cook, with no one else around, and no one to put up a façade for.  
最重要的是，他将单独教她烹饪，没有其他人在场，无需为任何人掩饰。

Asuka's lips turned upward in a gentle smile, and she drained the last of her hot chocolate.  Standing, she walked over to where the young man sat, taking a last sip of his tea.  Grabbing his arm, she dragged him out the door behind her, telling him in no uncertain terms that she was ready to go, and if he knew what was good for him, he would concur.  
明日香的嘴角微微上扬，露出一抹温柔的微笑，她喝完了最后一口热巧克力。站起身，她走向那位年轻人坐着的地方，他正喝着最后一口茶。抓住他的手臂，她拽着他跟在自己身后走出店门，明确无误地告诉他，她已经准备好离开了，如果他知道什么对自己好，就会同意。

As the young couple left the café, the waitress behind the counter sighed.  _Ahh, to be young and in love…_  
当这对年轻情侣离开咖啡馆时，柜台后的女服务员叹了口气。啊，年轻真好，恋爱真美……

The train ride home was far different that the one they had taken earlier that day.  Instead of being two of the few people on the train, it was now packed with the rush-hour work crowd, heading home to their families.  Men in suits talked on cellular phones, jabbering away about this project and that deal, and their eyes held no light in them, for they were still at work, so far as they were concerned.  
回家的火车之旅与他们当天早些时候乘坐的那趟截然不同。不再是车厢里寥寥数人，现在挤满了下班高峰时段的上班族，他们正赶回家与家人团聚。西装革履的男人们拿着手机谈论着这个项目和那个交易，他们的眼中没有光芒，因为在他们看来，工作还未结束。

As a result, when Asuka and Shinji stepped into the train, there was just barely room for them to stand, close to one another, with Shinji behind Asuka, and her in front, her back turned to him.  There was no more than a few inches separating them, and Shinji was glad for that small margin of safety.  The day had gone well so far, and it would not do for Asuka to kill him for actually being in physical contact without her permission.  
结果，当明日香和真嗣踏进列车时，仅剩的空间勉强够他们站立，彼此紧挨着，真嗣在明日香身后，而她面向前方，背对着他。他们之间不过几英寸的距离，真嗣为此感到庆幸，这微小的安全边际。今天到目前为止一切顺利，若因未经允许的身体接触而让明日香杀了他，那可就不妙了。

So when he felt her against him, he recoiled.  However, with the train as crowded as it was, there was nowhere for him to go, and he closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable blow.  
所以当感觉到她紧贴着自己时，他本能地退缩。然而，列车拥挤不堪，无处可逃，他闭上眼睛，等待着不可避免的打击。

It never came. 但那一击始终没有到来。

He opened one eye cautiously, looking slightly downward.  A head of red hair greeted him, and looking closer, he saw her head was leaning against his chest.  A gently rising and falling of her chest, along with the fact that her eyes were closed, told Shinji that she had fallen asleep.  It took him a moment to relax, realizing that he wasn't about to be killed.  This information reassuring him, he took a long moment to look at the sleeping girl.  
他小心翼翼地睁开一只眼睛，目光略微向下。一抹红发映入眼帘，仔细一看，她的头正靠在他的胸前。她胸口的轻柔起伏，以及紧闭的双眼，告诉真嗣她已经睡着了。他愣了一会儿才放松下来，意识到自己并未面临死亡威胁。这份安心感让他得以长时间凝视着这位熟睡的女孩。

As he gazed upon her, it seemed that everything else simply faded out of view.  The other passengers, the voices, the ringing phones, the constant clacking of the rails.  None of it reached him.  His entire world, at that moment, consisted of the young woman sleeping against him.  Absentmindedly, he reached up with a free hand, and gently brushed a few stray strands of hair away from her face, blushing as he did so.   
当他凝视着她时，周围的一切似乎都逐渐淡出了视野。其他乘客、嘈杂的声音、响个不停的手机、铁轨持续的咔嗒声，这一切都未曾打扰到他。那一刻，他的整个世界只剩下这位依偎在他怀中的年轻女子。他心不在焉地用空着的那只手抬起，轻柔地拨开她脸上的几缕散乱发丝，脸颊不由自主地泛起了红晕。

Time passed, and as people began to get off, Shinji gently led Asuka to a seat.  She was still partially asleep, and mumbled something about staying as such for a few more minutes.  He sat her down, sitting beside him, and her head once again came to rest upon his shoulder.  She mumbled something else, something he couldn't quite make out, but her lips curved upward in a content-looking smile, and she fell asleep once again.  Shinji almost wished they could stay on the train, this was the first time anything even remotely like this had occurred, and he anted it to last as long as possible.   
时间流逝，随着乘客陆续下车，真嗣轻柔地引导明日香坐到一个座位上。她仍处于半睡半醒状态，咕哝着希望能再这样待上几分钟。他让她坐下，自己则坐在她旁边，她的头再次靠在了他的肩上。她又喃喃自语了些什么，虽然他没听清，但她的嘴角上扬，露出了满足的微笑，随后再次进入了梦乡。真嗣几乎希望他们能一直留在列车上，这是他第一次经历如此温馨的时刻，他渴望它能尽可能地延续下去。

But alas, their stop came, and he was forced to gently awaken the sleeping girl next to him.  She mumbled once more about having to wake up, rising groggily from her seat and making her way to the doors.  As she looked at her companion, she was surprised to see him looking not only confident, but relaxed as well.  _He looks altogether_ too _calm for someone about to try to teach me something._ She mused, some of her old attitude coming back.  Vaguely she wondered what could have happened to cause such serenity.  "Shinji," she said, a note of warning in her voice, "you didn't try to cop a feel on the train, did you?"  
但遗憾的是，他们的站点到了，他不得不轻轻唤醒身旁熟睡的女孩。她再次咕哝着不得不醒来，从座位上昏昏沉沉地起身，走向车门。当她看着她的同伴时，惊讶地发现他不仅自信，而且非常放松。他看起来完全太镇定，对于一个即将试图教我东西的人来说。她暗自思忖，一些旧时的态度又回来了。她隐约想知道是什么导致了这样的宁静。“真嗣，”她用警告的语气说，“你没在火车上试图占便宜吧？”

And he laughed. 他笑了。

The sheer unexpectedness of it threw her completely off guard, taking away any scathing comments she had ready had he answered in his usual fashion.  His laugh was clear, and relaxing in a way.  Before she knew it, she was joining him, her giggles surprising her as much as his had.  "No, Asuka, I didn't try anything on the train." He said, finally composing himself.  You fell asleep against me, that's all.  You look so cute when you sleep."  
这突如其来的笑声完全让她措手不及，使她准备好的尖刻评论在他以平常方式回答时都消失了。他的笑声清晰而令人放松。不知不觉中，她也开始跟着笑，她的咯咯笑声和她听到他的笑声一样令她惊讶。“不，明日香，我在火车上什么都没试。”他终于平静下来，说道，“你靠着我睡着了，仅此而已。你睡觉的样子真可爱。”

Again, she felt the blood rushing to her cheeks, although this time, it was matched by a blush from her compatriot.  She looked at him with scrutiny.  "How long have you been trying to say something like that?"  
又一次，她感到血液涌上脸颊，尽管这次，她的同伴也脸红了。她仔细打量着他。"你尝试说那样的话多久了？"

He looked back at her, completely serious.  
他回望着她，一脸严肃。

"Since I met you."  
“自从遇见你。”

She felt her face turning a shade of red that would put a tomato to shame.   
她感到自己的脸红得足以让番茄都自愧不如。

They entered the apartment, Shinji dropping the bags on the table, and making a quick stop in the bathroom.  Asuka began to unload everything from the bags, laying everything out neatly on the table, and wondering what in the world it was that Shinji was going to teach her how to make.  The only thing she could gather was that it might be a dessert, which pleased her.  She had been thinking that he would try to teach her to make some kind of Japanese food, but this looked more like-  
他们走进公寓，真嗣将袋子丢在桌上，迅速去了趟洗手间。明日香开始从袋子里取出所有东西，整齐地摆放在桌上，好奇真嗣究竟要教她做什么。她唯一能猜到的是这可能是一种甜点，这让她很高兴。她原以为他会尝试教她做某种日本料理，但看起来更像是——

"Hey!" “嘿！”

She turned to see him standing there, a mock-serious look on his face.  "No trying to guess what it is, you'll find out after you've made it."  
她转头看见他站在那里，脸上带着假装严肃的表情。“别试图猜测是什么，做好之后你就知道了。”

"Hmph.  You better help, if you know what's good for you."  
“哼。你要是识相的话，最好帮忙。”

He smiled, reassuring her.  "I will, I will."  Walking over to her, he surveyed the kitchen, taking it in as if it were his personal kingdom.  
他微笑着，让她安心。“我会帮忙的，会的。”他走向她，审视着厨房，仿佛那是他的私人王国。

Which for tonight, at least, it was.  
至少今晚是这样。

"Ok.  Asuka, get out a medium-sized bowl.  We're going to start with the crust."  
“好的。明日香，拿一个中等大小的碗来。我们要从饼皮开始。”

"Crust?" “饼皮？”

"Trust me." "相信我。"

She complied, retrieving the bowl from it's place in the cabinet, while Shinji prepared the chocolate wafer crumbs, butter, and sugar.  When she sat the bowl in front of him, he grinned, and pushed it pack at her.  "Oh, no.  I said I'd help.  Now, take this stuff," he gestured to the three ingredients, "and mix them in that."  
她照做了，从橱柜里取出碗，而真嗣则准备好了巧克力威化饼碎、黄油和糖。当她把碗放在他面前时，他咧嘴一笑，又把碗推回给她。“哦，不。我说过我会帮忙。现在，把这些东西，”他指着那三种原料，“混合到那个碗里。”

She looked at him.  "With what, my hands?"  
她看着他。“用什么，我的手吗？”

She found herself looking at a grin that sent a shiver down her spine.  It wasn't a bad shiver, either.  "Yes, Asuka, with your hands.  Didn't you ever have Play-Doh as a kid?"  
"她发现自己正看着一个笑容，那笑容让她脊背发凉。但这并不是什么糟糕的感觉。“是的，明日香，用你的手。你小时候没玩过橡皮泥吗？””

The glare he got back was answer enough.  Grumbling about doing 'kid stuff', she began to mash the three into a solid ball.  "Remember to mix them evenly, otherwise, the crust will burn in some places, and be raw in others."  
"他得到的瞪视已经足够说明问题。他咕哝着做“小孩子的事情”，她开始将三种材料捣成一个实心球。“记得要均匀混合，否则饼皮有的地方会烧焦，有的地方还是生的。””

Asuka tried again, and this time, the ball was a uniform color, ready to be pressed into the bowl.  "Okay, now flatten it out, and form it to the inside of the bowl.  After that, put it in the fridge, and we'll start on the cake-"  
"明日香又试了一次，这次球的颜色均匀，准备压入碗中。“好了，现在把它压平，贴合碗的内侧。之后放进冰箱，我们就开始做蛋糕——””

He stopped, realizing that he had just let slip a hint on his plan.  Asuka looked up from the bowl, a gleam in her eyes.  "What was that?"  
他顿住了，意识到自己刚刚不小心透露了计划的线索。 明日香从碗里抬起头，眼中闪过一丝光芒。 “那是什么？”

Shinji nervously wringed his hands.  "Uhm, that was nothing.  I said that we can't be up late…"  
真嗣紧张地绞着双手。 “呃，没什么。我只是说我们不能熬夜……”

Asuka looked at him, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.  "You said no such thing, baka.  I distinctly heard the word _cake_ in there somewhere.  Is that what we're making?"  
明日香看着他，嘴角勾起一抹微笑。“你可没这么说，笨蛋。我分明听到了‘蛋糕’这个词。我们是要做蛋糕吗？”

"No." “不。”

Her premature smile began to fade.  If this was all some sort of joke…  
她那过早绽放的微笑开始消退。如果这一切只是某种玩笑……

"It's what _you're making."_  
“这就是你正在制造的。”

_

The smile returned fully, and before she knew what she was doing, she reached her arms around him and gave him a hug.  Almost as soon as she did so, she released him, a blush showing her embarrassment at her sudden showing of affection for the young Ikari.  Still standing close to him, she asked, "But if I'm making a cake, what are we eating for dinner?"  
"笑容完全回到了她的脸上，还没等她意识到自己在做什么，她已经伸出手臂环抱住他，给了他一个拥抱。几乎就在她这么做的同时，她松开了他，脸颊上的红晕显露出她对这位年轻的碇君突然表达爱意的尴尬。尽管仍然站在他身边，她问道：“但如果我在做蛋糕，我们晚餐吃什么呢？””

Uh-oh. 哎呀。

_Dinner? 晚餐？_

In all his planning, he had forgotten this minor detail.  Fortunately for him, a certain NERV Major was not the operations director for nothing.  As Shinji pondered this, the doorbell rang.  Almost thankful for the reason to get out of such close proximity to the Second Child, he went to answer it, calling over his shoulder as he went.  "Don't worry, we'll think of something!"  
在他所有的计划中，他忘记了这样一个小细节。幸运的是，某位 NERV 少校绝非浪得虚名的作战部长。当真嗣思考着这一点时，门铃响了。他几乎感激这个理由，可以暂时离开与二号适格者如此近距离的尴尬，于是他去开门，一边走一边回头喊道：“别担心，我们会有办法的！”

As he reached the entryway, he wondered who it could be.  Misato was out with Kaji, so that precluded both of them from being possibilities.  Rei?  He dismissed the thought.  As much as he cared for the pale-skinned enigma, he couldn't imagine her coming over on a whim.  A small part of him wondered if she even _had_ whims.  
当他走到门口时，他好奇会是谁。美里和加持出去了，所以他们俩都不可能。丽？他打消了这个念头。尽管他对那位皮肤苍白的谜样少女很关心，但他无法想象她会一时兴起来访。他内心的一小部分甚至怀疑她是否有一时兴起的念头。

Touji or Kensuke?  Either one of them would have called, and neither had.  So, with no idea who was standing on his front porch, he opened the door.  
东治或健介？他们中的任何一个都会先打电话，而且两人都没有。因此，在不知道谁站在他家门口的情况下，他打开了门。

A young man stood there, about twenty years of age, and in his hands, he held a bag that smelled suspiciously of lasagna.  "Uh, I have a delivery here for a Shinji Ikari?"  
一个年轻人站在那里，大约二十岁左右，手里提着一个散发着疑似千层面气味的袋子。“呃，我这里有一份给碇真嗣的外卖？”

Shinji thought back.  He had made no such order, and even if he had, he had spent all of his available money on the ingredients for Asuka's cake.  "I think there might be a mistake…"  
真嗣回想了一下。他没有下过这样的订单，即使有，他所有的钱也都花在了给明日香买蛋糕的材料上。“我想可能是弄错了……”

"There's a note included, from a Misato Katsuragi, and the bill is already paid."  
“里面有一张便条，来自葛城美里，账单已经付过了。”

Dumbfounded, he took the food, thanking the man.  Closing the door, he carefully set the bag down, and read the note.  
他目瞪口呆地接过食物，向那人道谢。关上门后，他小心翼翼地将袋子放下，并读起了那张便条。

_Shinji, 真嗣，_

   _I didn't think you'd have time to cook dinner and try to teach Asuka at the same time, so this should help.  If she asks, you can take the credit, Casanova.  Good luck!  
我想你没时间一边做饭一边教明日香，所以这个应该能帮上忙。如果她问起来，你可以揽下功劳，情圣。祝好运！_

     _-Misato  -美里_

He looked at the note, wondering how in the world she could have known.  It occurred to him that perhaps she had been paying more attention than he gave her credit for.  Shrugging and giving a silent thanks to his guardian, he returned to the kitchen to find Asuka getting out a variety of spoons and other utensils.  "I told you there was no need to worry, Asuka," as he set the food on the counter.  "We'll finish up on the crust and filling, and then eat while it chills."  
他看着那张纸条，疑惑她究竟是如何得知的。他突然想到，或许她比他所认为的要更加关注他。耸了耸肩，默默感谢他的守护者，他回到厨房，发现明日香正在拿出各种勺子和其他餐具。“我告诉过你没必要担心，明日香，”他将食物放在柜台上说道，“我们会完成饼皮和馅料，然后趁它冷却时享用。”

His female companion raised an eyebrow.  "We?"  
他的女伴挑了挑眉。“我们？”

He smiled.  "I'm going to taste everything to make sure it's all right."  
他微笑着。“我要尝遍所有东西，确保一切都好。”

She raised a hand in mock anger. "You!"   
她佯装生气地举起手。“你！”

With that, she began to hit him in the shoulder.  Not hard, but enough to know that she didn't appreciate his attempt at humor.  He laughingly took his blows, grinning and chuckling the whole time.  
说完，她开始捶打他的肩膀。不重，但足以表明她并不欣赏他的幽默尝试。他笑着承受着她的捶打，全程咧嘴笑着，不时发出轻笑声。

After Shinji put the lasagna in the oven to keep it warm,  he supervised Asuka as she finished the preparations for the dessert.  Though she knew it to be some type of cake, she had no idea as to exactly what kind it was.  When Shinji took over to prepare the topping, she was almost disappointed.  It had actually been quite a learning experience for them both, and Asuka proved to be a receptive student, listening to him, and occasionally giving him a smile as a reward when he showed her something she particularly liked.  
在碇真嗣将千层面放入烤箱保温后，他监督着明日香完成甜点的准备工作。虽然她知道那是一种蛋糕，但具体是什么类型的她毫无头绪。当真嗣接手准备顶饰时，她几乎有些失望。实际上，这对他们俩来说都是一次学习经历，明日香证明了自己是个接受能力强的学生，倾听他的指导，偶尔在他展示她特别喜欢的东西时给予微笑作为奖励。

Fascinated, she watched as he pulled the baking sheet of chocolate from the freezer, and set it down.  This done, he took a flat knife, and began to use it to make curls, pushing it along the sheet, and causing a curling flake of chocolate to appear at the end of the knife.  Asuka immediately took the first one, popping in into her mouth.  "Mmmm." She purred, in a voice that would likely keep her teacher awake for a good portion of the night.  
她着迷地看着他从冰箱里取出巧克力烤盘，并将其放下。随后，他拿起一把扁平的刀，开始制作巧克力卷，沿着烤盘推动刀子，刀尖随即出现一片卷曲的巧克力。明日香立刻拿起第一片，放入口中。“嗯~”她发出低沉的呻吟，那声音很可能会让她的老师整晚难以入眠。

Shinji, for his part, decided to have a little fun himself.  The next piece of chocolate came off the sheet, and he wrapped it carefully around the tip of his index finger, making it look almost like a sugary ring.  He held it up for her to see.  "Would you like another?"  
至于真嗣，他自己也决定找点乐子。下一块巧克力从纸上剥离，他小心翼翼地将其缠绕在食指尖上，看起来几乎像一枚糖制的戒指。他举起来让她看。“还想再来一块吗？”

Asuka allowed a tight smile to creep onto her features.  Little did he know.  
明日香脸上露出一丝紧绷的微笑。他可不知道。

Taking the proffered finger, she slowly raised it to her lips.  As Shinji's heart rate began to increase at a geometric rate, she seductively placed it inside her mouth, using her tongue to melt the chocolate curl around his digit before licking it clean.   
她接过他递来的手指，缓缓将其抬至唇边。随着真嗣的心跳开始以几何倍数加速，她诱人地将手指含入口中，用舌头融化缠绕在他指尖的巧克力卷，然后舔舐干净。

As she took his finger from her lips, she could see that his face was past scarlet, and was rapidly approaching vermillion.  His eyes were closed, and she could see that his breathing was rapid and shallow.  _That's for this morning, Third Child._  
当她从唇边移开他的手指时，她看到他的脸已经红得发紫，正迅速向朱红色转变。他的眼睛紧闭着，她能看出他的呼吸急促而浅短。“这是为了今早的事，三号机。”

Shinji slowly opened his eyes, still not quite believing what had just transpired between him and the Second.  He was still trying to gain control of his breathing, and his heart was racing far faster than it had this morning when _he_ had been the initiator.  He looked at her, fully expecting to see an arrogant smirk.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，仍然不太相信刚刚与二号机之间发生的一切。他仍在努力控制自己的呼吸，心跳比今早他主动时跳得还要快得多。他看着她，满心以为会看到一个傲慢的冷笑。

Asuka simply stood there, a smile on her face.  Shinji, seeing this, took an involuntary step towards her, and when she didn't move away, began to lean in toward her.   
明日香只是站在那里，脸上带着微笑。真嗣看到这一幕，不由自主地向她迈了一步，见她没有退开，便开始向她倾斜过去。

She mirrored him, slowly moving towards Shinji, her breathing quickening as well, eyes closing as the distance between their lips decreased.  She could feel his breath, and her thoughts were a storm.  _Why am I doing this?  Do I even_ want _to do this?_  
她模仿着他的动作，缓缓向真嗣靠近，呼吸也随之加快，随着两人唇间距离的缩短，眼睛也闭上了。她能感受到他的呼吸，思绪如风暴般翻涌。我为什么要这么做？我真的想这么做吗？

_

RRRIIIINNNNGGGG 铃铃铃铃铃铃

The two jerked apart, breathing heavily, and not sure why.  Shinji was the first to recover, stammering.  "T..the timer…"  
两人猛地分开，喘着粗气，不知为何。真嗣最先回过神来，结结巴巴地说：“闹…闹钟响了…”

Asuka felt…almost disappointed.   
明日香感到……几乎有些失望。

Ja! 是的！

____
Asuka watched as Shinji removed the cake from the oven, and set it carefully in the refrigerator, letting it cool before serving it.  
明日香看着真嗣从烤箱中取出蛋糕，小心翼翼地放进冰箱，让它冷却后再享用。

_So close 如此接近_

She had to stop herself from gasping at this unsummoned thought.  Did she actually want to kiss him?  Thinking harder on it, she could arrive at no definite answer, and this troubled her.  While one side of her still saw him as the spineless wimp that she had worked with for over a year now, that side was slowly being silenced by the part of her that was beginning to see him for what he really was: a handsome young man, growing into his role as a pilot, and a damn good cook to boot.  
她不得不抑制住因这个突如其来的念头而倒吸一口气的冲动。她真的想吻他吗？深入思考后，她无法得出一个明确的答案，这让她感到困扰。尽管她的一部分仍然视他为那个软弱无能的同事，这个声音正逐渐被另一部分所压制，那部分开始看清他的真实面目：一个英俊的年轻人，正逐渐成长为一名飞行员，而且还是个相当出色的厨师。

She had known a lot of so called 'men' in college that weren't half the man Shinji would be.  They were all concerned with two things.  Sex and partying.  It was all so boring to her, and after dating a few of them, she had sworn off boyfriends completely.  Until she met Kaji, that was.  
她在大学里见识过不少所谓的‘男人’，他们连真嗣的一半都比不上。这些人只关心两件事：性和派对。对她来说，这一切都无聊透顶，几段恋情下来，她彻底发誓不再交男朋友。直到遇见加持，情况才有所改变。

Kaji was what she thought the ideal man should be.  Tall, strong, attractive, and sexy.  And while Kaji was undeniably all of these, he was also involved with Misato.  It had taken her a while to accept that he would never be hers, and that he saw her as possibly a little sister.   
加持是她心目中理想男人的模样。高大、强壮、英俊且性感。尽管加持无疑具备所有这些特质，但他与美里关系密切。她花了好一阵子才接受他永远不会属于她，以及他可能只把她当作一个小妹妹看待。

She remembered with a frown the way she had tried to seduce him on the _Over the Rainbow_.  It had been so childish of her, and also had probably given a perceived image of herself to him.   
她皱着眉头回想起在“彩虹之上”号上试图引诱他的情景。那时的她真是幼稚，此举或许也给他留下了某种印象。

Closing her eyes, she pushed the memory aside.  It would do no good to dwell on past mistakes when she had a chance to rectify them in the present.  "Shinji?"  
她闭上眼睛，将那段记忆推开。沉湎于过去的错误无济于事，她现在有机会去纠正它们。“真嗣？”

He looked up. "Yes, Asuka?"  
他抬起头。“什么事，明日香？”

"I'm hungry." “我饿了。”

Shinji smiled.  "Go wait in the living room, Asuka, and I'll clean up and set the table.  I'll call you when it's ready."  
真嗣微笑着说：“去客厅等着吧，明日香，我来收拾并摆好餐桌。准备好了我会叫你的。”

_Shinji's POV 真嗣的视角_

I watched as she left the kitchen, her hair flowing behind her in a scarlet sheet.  Suppressing a sigh, I turned to survey the kitchen, and the mess that remained from her efforts.  While Asuka might not be the tidiest person in the kitchen, she was certainly the most attractive.  
我看着她离开厨房，她那鲜红的头发如同一幅红绸般飘扬在身后。我抑制住叹息，转身审视厨房，以及她留下的那一团糟。虽然明日香在厨房里可能不是最整洁的人，但她绝对是最迷人的。

Cleaning up took the better part of twenty minutes, during which I thought on my current situation.  Asuka and I were getting closer, that was undeniable.  But how close we would get was the unknown in this equation.  While I would certainly welcome the chance to become closer to my roommate and fellow pilot, what I would do in such a situation was beyond me.  I had managed to bluff my way through it so far, but it had been half in jest.  I had had no illusions about her actually following through on anything that I had instigated, and now that it appeared that she might after all, I would have to tread quite carefully indeed.  
打扫工作花了将近二十分钟，期间我思考着目前的处境。我和明日香的关系越来越近，这是毋庸置疑的。但我们能走多近，却是这个等式中的未知数。虽然我当然欢迎有机会与我的室友兼战友更亲近，但在这种情况下我会怎么做，我心里也没底。到目前为止，我都是半开玩笑地蒙混过关。我从未幻想过她会真的按照我挑起的事情去做，现在看来她可能会，我确实得非常小心谨慎。

I finished the last of the dishes and placed them in the dishwasher, my hands a bit wrinkled from the dishwater.  Closing the door, I started the machine, it's soothing back and forth sounds helping to calm my inner turmoil.  I wasn't even sure how to proceed with dinner now, not wanting to make the wrong impression, but not wanting to waste the chance either.  
我洗完最后几个盘子，把它们放进洗碗机，手因为洗碗水而有些皱。关上门，启动机器，它那舒缓的来回声响有助于平息我内心的纷乱。我现在甚至不确定该如何准备晚餐，不想留下错误的印象，也不想错失这个机会。

Wiping the small table down, I decided on a quiet setting that had the potential to be romantic, but didn't try to force it on the inhabitants.  I laid the white tablecloth down, smoothing the wrinkles out of it, and thought of how I would act now.  Would she like water or maybe a glass of wine?  A large serving or small?  Should I pull her chair out or let her do it herself?  
我擦干净小桌子，决定营造一个安静的氛围，它有可能变得浪漫，但不会强加于人。我铺上白色桌布，抚平上面的皱褶，思考着现在该如何表现。她会喜欢水还是来杯葡萄酒？大份还是小份？我应该为她拉开椅子还是让她自己来？

So many questions, the least of which being those pertaining to dinner.  What about afterwards, after we were done eating, and after my assignment to teach her was effectively finished?  Would she go back to treating me the way she always had?  Would her only words to me start with 'baka' and end with some unidentifiable but vicious sounding German curse?  
问题太多了，最不重要的就是关于晚餐的。之后呢，吃完饭以后，我的教学任务实际上也结束了，她会回到以前那样对待我吗？她对我说的唯一的话会不会是以'笨蛋'开头，以某种无法辨认但听起来很恶毒的德语诅咒结尾？

Would she even allow me to be her friend at all?  
她甚至会允许我成为她的朋友吗？

So many things had happened in the past year, so many little incidents to serve to push us farther apart.  First, my sync ratio.  I remembered all too well how angry she had been when she had found out that I had somehow miraculously synchronized with the Evangelion on my first try, when it had taken her months just to walk.  I recalled rather vividly how mad she had been after I had saved her from the volcano, after she had resigned herself to dying after defeating the Angel.  I had deliberately disobeyed a direct order from my superior officer, though I doubted that she knew that.  Misato had been both angry and pleased at the same time afterwards, angry for my insolence, and pleased that I had saved her life.  
过去一年发生了太多事情，太多微不足道的小事将我们越推越远。首先，是我的同步率。我清楚记得她发现我第一次尝试就奇迹般地与 EVA 同步成功时有多生气，而她自己花了数月时间才勉强能行走。我还生动地记得，从火山中救出她后，她有多愤怒，尽管她已准备好在与使徒战斗后赴死。我故意违抗了上级直接命令，尽管我怀疑她并不知情。事后，美里既生气又高兴，气我的无礼，也高兴我救了她的命。

I remembered the time that we had had to train for three days to synchronize with each other to defeat the Seventh.  Those three days were, at the time, both the worst and best of my life, for the fact that I had been in such close proximity with her.  At times it had been nothing more than an increase in the usual amount of insults she gave me, but that one night, that one night when she had sleepwalked her way to my futon, and I had nearly kissed her.  I had realized then, after she had murmured 'momma' that she was nothing more than a child herself.  While she would be loath to admit this, I knew it all the same.  
我记得那次为了同步配合击败第七名，我们不得不训练了三天。那三天，在当时，既是我生命中最糟糕也是最美好的时光，只因我与她如此近距离相处。有时，这不过是她对我日常嘲讽的增加，但那个夜晚，她梦游般走到我的床垫旁，我差点吻了她。那时，在她喃喃喊着'妈妈'之后，我意识到她自己也不过是个孩子。尽管她不愿承认，但我心知肚明。

I hadn't kissed her then, but later on, she had kissed me, holding my nose closed to keep my breath from tickling her.  It had been pleasant, until my face started turning blue from lack of oxygen.  Afterwards, she had rushed to the bathroom to brush her teeth and gargle with mouthwash.  
那时我没有吻她，但后来，她吻了我，捏住我的鼻子不让我的呼吸逗弄她。起初感觉不错，直到我的脸因缺氧开始变蓝。之后，她冲进浴室刷牙并用漱口水漱口。

I don't think I had ever felt so useless.  I mean, Father had brought me here simply because he 'had a use for me'.  But with Asuka, it hurt more, because she would act smooth and sultry one minute, and hit or insult me the next.  I felt like an idiot at times for thinking that maybe, maybe, she liked me.   
我觉得自己从未如此无用。父亲带我来这里只是因为他‘有用得着我’。但对明日香来说，这种感觉更甚，因为她时而表现得温柔妩媚，下一刻却可能打我或侮辱我。有时候，我真觉得自己像个傻瓜，竟然会想，也许，也许她对我有好感。

But the times when she smiled, regardless of who the smile was directed at, warmed my heart.  I used to imagine that she was smiling at me, smiling at something I did, or perhaps something I said.  It helped me through some of the tougher times, and gave me a sense of purpose.  
但每当她微笑时，无论那微笑是给谁的，都温暖了我的心。我曾幻想过那微笑是给我的，因为我做了什么，或是说了什么。这帮助我度过了一些艰难时刻，并赋予了我一种使命感。

Because in the year I had lived with her, in the year that I had know and worked with her, I had realized something.  
因为在与她同住的这一年里，在认识她并与之共事的这一年里，我意识到了一些事情。

I was falling in love with her.  
我正陷入对她的爱恋之中。

I finished up my preparations for dinner, hoping that everything would meet her approval, and drew a shaky breath.  
我完成了晚餐的准备工作，希望一切都能得到她的认可，然后深吸了一口颤抖的气。

"Asuka, dinner's ready!"  
“明日香，晚餐准备好了！”

_Asuka's POV 明日香的第一人称视角_

I paced my room, wondering for probably the tenth time what was taking so long for Shinji to get dinner ready.  I mean, the stuff was already cooked, how much time did it take to dish it onto a plate and set in on a table?  
我在房间里来回踱步，大概第十次在想，真嗣准备晚餐怎么花了这么长时间。我的意思是，东西都已经煮好了，把它们盛到盘子里再摆到桌上需要多少时间呢？

I sighed, trying to guess what Misato and Kaji were doing right now.  They were probably enjoying a nice, romantic meal, in some nice restaurant, and she was probably wearing a nice dress, and Kaji was probably wearing a nice jacket, and they were probably having a nice time.  Meanwhile, here I was, in a old pair of jeans, and a sweatshirt stained with the labors of earlier, waiting for Shinji to tell me that dinner was ready.  
我叹了口气，试图猜测美里和加持现在在做什么。他们大概正在某个不错的餐厅里享受一顿浪漫的晚餐，美里可能穿着漂亮的裙子，加持可能穿着帅气的夹克，他们大概正度过愉快的时光。而与此同时，我在这里，穿着一条旧牛仔裤和一件沾满之前劳作痕迹的卫衣，等待真嗣告诉我晚餐准备好了。

Maybe someday, I'd get a nice, romantic meal from someone that could treat me like a lady should be treated, someone that knew the pleasures of simple conversation, without trying to have an ulterior motive, like a nightcap, or sex.  Those kind of guys were rare in the world.  In fact, I only knew of one that resembled it, and he was currently preparing dinner in the kitchen-  
也许有一天，我会从某个人那里得到一顿美好而浪漫的晚餐，那个人能像对待女士应有的那样对待我，懂得简单对话的乐趣，不带任何别有用心的动机，比如喝一杯，或是性。那种男人在世上极为罕见。事实上，我只认识一个与之相似的人，而他此刻正在厨房准备晚餐——

It hit me like a lighting bolt, the realization that Shinji Ikari, Evangelion pilot, cellist, roommate, and son of Commander Ikari was everything I was looking for.  And I had been living with him for over a year now, using him to pump up my own fragile ego, cutting him down to make myself look all the better.  I had insulted him, demeaned him, abused and used him.  
这突如其来的领悟犹如一道闪电击中了我，意识到碇真嗣，这位《新世纪福音战士》的驾驶员、大提琴手、室友，以及碇司令的儿子，正是我一直在寻找的一切。而我与他同居已有一年多，却一直利用他来提升自己脆弱的自尊，贬低他以显得自己更加优越。我曾侮辱他、贬低他、虐待他、利用他。

A tear slid down my cheek, as I recalled how I had treated him after he had saved my life.  I had only been concerned that Misato had used my imminent death to showcase NERV's greatest weapon again.  Afterwards, I hadn't even thanked him, instead insulting him again and storming off.  He had saved my _life, the greatest thing that a person can do for another, short of dying for them, and he'd come awfully close to that as well.  After all, he had had no protective equipment when he dove into the lava, nothing between him and the murderous heat that had nearly boiled _me_ alive._  
一滴泪水滑过我的脸颊，当我回想起在他救了我之后我是如何对待他的。我只关心美里是否利用了我即将死亡的危机再次展示了 NERV 最强大的武器。之后，我甚至没有感谢他，反而再次侮辱了他，然后愤然离去。他救了我的命，这是一个人能为另一个人做的最伟大的事情，除了为他们而死，而他几乎做到了这一点。毕竟，当他跳进熔岩时，他没有穿戴任何防护装备，没有任何东西隔在他和那几乎将我活活煮沸的致命高温之间。

_

And afterwards, he hadn't gotten angry at my lack of gratitude, hadn't yelled, or pouted, but simply took it in stride.  Like he was used to it.  As he probably was.  
而之后，他并没有因为我的忘恩负义而生气，没有大喊大叫，也没有撅嘴，只是淡然接受。就像他已经习惯了。可能确实如此。

I made the decision then and there that things were going to be different from now on, that I wasn't going to treat him like shit, but instead like another person.  I mean, hell, his own father had used him, coerced him into piloting by acting as if he was going to have Wondergirl pilot again.  And he had had no training, no preparation for what he was going up against.  He must have been scared to death.  And while I never would have admitted it, when we went up against the sixth angel, I was scared too.  I was more scared than I had ever been in my life.   
我当即下定决心，从今往后一切都要有所不同，我不会再对他恶劣，而是将他视作一个平等的人。我的意思是，见鬼，他自己的父亲都利用他，胁迫他驾驶 EVA，仿佛要让 Wondergirl 再次上阵。而他毫无训练，毫无准备地面对这一切。他一定怕得要命。虽然我绝不会承认，但当我们对抗第六使徒时，我也害怕了。那是我一生中从未有过的恐惧。

Having him in the cockpit, nestled behind me, I was reassured that somehow, some way, everything would turn out okay.  It was as if I had a guardian angel watching over me.  When his hands had rested over my own, right before the battleships rammed the Angel's mouth, I had felt a tingle of warmth, of pleasantness come over me.  His hands fitted mine perfectly.  And he had looked pretty good in that red plugsuit too…  
有他在驾驶舱里，紧靠在我身后，我莫名感到安心，仿佛一切都会好起来。就像有一位守护天使在照看我。当他的手覆在我的手上，就在战舰撞击使徒之口前，我感到了一阵暖意和愉悦。他的手与我的完美契合。而且，他穿着那件红色驾驶服的样子也相当不错……

The blush that came over me was sudden, and I started to change out of my clothes, determined to make things right between us tonight.  Because after all, I could still have fun with him, so long as I rewarded him later.  
那突如其来的脸红让我措手不及，我开始换下衣服，决心今晚要修复我们之间的关系。毕竟，只要我稍后给他些奖励，我还是能和他一起享受乐趣的。

A few minutes later, I was putting some finishing touches on my hair when I heard Shinji.  
几分钟后，我正在为头发做最后的修饰，这时我听到了真嗣的声音。

"Asuka, dinner's ready!"  
“明日香，晚饭好了！”

Shinji waited patiently for Asuka in the kitchen, the soft light from the candles flickering gently over the small room, throwing shadows in abstract patterns that made him think about the refractive effects that light had when seen through a glass of water-  
真嗣在厨房里耐心地等待着明日香，柔和的烛光轻轻摇曳，照亮了狭小的房间，投射出抽象的影子，让他想起了光线透过一杯水时的折射效果——

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

His train of thought broken, he looked up at the sound of her voice.  
他的思绪被她的声音打断，抬头望去。

And what was left of that train was completely derailed.  Asuka stood there, her hair down, the A-10 neural connectors gone, allowing the locks to flow freely.  She was no longer dressed as she had been when she left the room.  A sleek, red dress clung to her body, the hem coming nearly to her ankles, a long slit running up one side, making for a nice mixture of modest and sexy.  
那列火车的残骸已彻底脱轨。明日香站在那里，头发散落，A-10 神经连接器不复存在，任由发丝自由飘扬。她不再穿着离开房间时的装束。一件紧身的红色连衣裙贴合着她的身躯，裙摆几乎垂至脚踝，一侧长长的开衩，既端庄又不失性感。

Her mouth was hanging slightly open, apparently she hadn't expected this.  Or had she?  After all, there was absolutely no reason for her to be wearing such a nice dress for what was to be an ordinary dinner.  Unless for some reason she didn't see it that way.  
她的嘴微微张开，显然她没有预料到这一幕。又或者，她早已料到？毕竟，她完全没有理由为了一个普通的晚餐而穿上如此华丽的礼服。除非，她对这件事有着不同的看法。

"Shinji, is this all…for me?"  
“真嗣，这一切……都是为了我吗？”

Her voice held a note of wonder, and Shinji felt a smile coming on.  He had expected anger, sarcasm, and possible violence.   
她的声音带着一丝惊奇，这让真嗣不由自主地露出了微笑。他本以为会迎来愤怒、讽刺，甚至可能是暴力。

He hadn't expected happiness.  
他没想到会是快乐。

She slowly approached the table, and he pulled out her chair, allowing her to sit.  She gracefully took her seat, and unfolded the napkin that was placed to the side of her plate, spreading it across her lap.  "So," she murmured, "what's the deal with all this?"  
她缓缓走向桌子，他为她拉开椅子，让她坐下。她优雅地就座，展开放在盘子旁边的小餐巾，铺在腿上。“那么，”她低声问道，“这一切是怎么回事？”

It was a measure of his bewilderment that she wasn't displeased that he didn't answer immediately.  "I..I just wanted to say thank you for being such a good student."  
他对她的反应感到困惑，因为她并没有因为他没有立即回答而不悦。“我……我只是想感谢你，作为一个如此优秀的学生。”

She looked at him with an indescribable expression.  "Well, you're an exceptional teacher, Shinji." She replied, a smile gracing her face, the candlelight highlighting her full lips and blue eyes.  "You know, I've never had someone do something so nice for me.  
她用一种难以言喻的表情看着他。“嗯，你是个出色的老师，真嗣。”她回答道，脸上浮现出微笑，烛光映衬着她丰满的嘴唇和蓝色的眼睛。“你知道吗，我从没遇到过有人为我做这么好的事。”

"I've treated you like complete garbage since the day I met you, Shinji.  I've done nothing even remotely nice for you, and you still have the courtesy to make me a wonderful dinner."  
“自从遇见你那天起，我就一直把你当垃圾对待，真嗣。我从未为你做过任何哪怕稍微好一点的事，而你却依然有礼貌地为我准备了一顿美妙的晚餐。”

She took a bite of the lasagna, chewing thoughtfully.  "I don't think that anyone else would have been able to stand it.  You are truly an exceptional person, Shinji Ikari."  
她咬了一口千层面，若有所思地咀嚼着。“我想没有其他人能忍受得了。你真是一个特别的人，碇真嗣。”

To his credit, Shinji managed to keep his jaw from falling.  Sure, he had enjoyed the relatively pleasant company that she had provided him over the past couple of days, as opposed to her usual attitude, but never had he once expected her to say something like _that_.  
值得称赞的是，碇真嗣设法保持了下巴没有掉下来。确实，过去几天里，她提供的相对愉快的陪伴与他平时所见的她的态度截然不同，但他从未想过她会说出这样的话。

Sampling his own plate, he found the lasagna good; Misato must have ordered from one of the better places in the city.  He swallowed, taking a sip of water to wash it down.  "Asuka, I…"  
尝了一口自己的盘子，他发现千层面味道不错；美里一定是订了城里一家比较好的餐厅。他咽下食物，喝了一口水冲下去。“明日香，我……”

She held up a hand.  "I'm not finished, Shinji," she said, some of the old fire lighting up her eyes.  "I've been completely unbearable to be around since I've moved in.  I've used you, and I've hurt you."  A tear fell from her eye, a glittering drop that struck the tablecloth, leaving a small spot on it's otherwise pristine surface.  "Why?"  
她举起一只手。“我还没说完，真嗣，”她说，眼中闪烁着往日的火焰。“自从我搬进来后，我一直让人难以忍受。我利用了你，也伤害了你。”一滴泪珠从她的眼角滑落，闪烁着落在桌布上，在它原本无瑕的表面上留下了一个小斑点。“为什么？”

It took him a second to understand what she said, her voice was little more than a whisper.  "Asuka…I don't understand."  
他花了一会儿才理解她的话，她的声音几乎低不可闻。“明日香……我不明白。”

"Why are you so nice to me, Shinji?"  The tears were starting to flow freely now.  "Why the _hell don't you hate me?"_  
“为什么你对我这么好，真嗣？”泪水开始自由地流淌。“你为什么不恨我？”

_

So that was it.  
原来如此。

Reaching across the tiny table, careful not to knock over the candle, he placed a hand over hers, giving it a gentle squeeze.  "Asuka, I don't hate you.  I don't even dislike you."  Dimly aware of anything but the sensation of her hand under his, he continued.  "I think that you're a wonderful person Asuka.  Underneath all that pain, all that hardship, is a great person, trying to get out.  
"他小心翼翼地越过小桌子，生怕碰倒了蜡烛，将手放在她的手上，轻轻握紧。“明日香，我不恨你。我甚至不讨厌你。”除了她手在他手下的感觉，其他一切都变得模糊不清，他继续说道。“我觉得你是个很棒的人，明日香。在所有那些痛苦和艰难之下，是一个想要挣脱出来的伟大的人。”

"I'm just trying to help."  
“我只是想帮忙。”

It was more than the young girl could take.  That someone whom she had treated so badly could still care for her so much.  Asuka leapt from her chair, knocking it over in the process, and flew into the surprised you man's arms.  Shinji carefully placed one hand at the small of her back, making small circles, while the other stroked her hair.  His shoulder grew wet from her tears, as she sobbed.  "I-I-"  
这对年轻的女孩来说太过沉重。她曾那样恶劣对待的人，竟然还能如此深切地关心她。明日香从椅子上跳了起来，顺手将椅子撞翻，扑进了那位惊讶的少年怀中。真嗣小心翼翼地将一只手放在她的腰际，轻轻画着圈，另一只手则轻抚着她的头发。她的泪水浸湿了他的肩膀，她抽泣着，“我-我-”

Her arms wrapped around him, holding on for dear life, as if he was the only anchor that was keeping her afloat in a raging sea of emotion.  "Shhh," he murmured in her ear, holding her gently.  "It's ok, Asuka.  It's ok."  
她的双臂紧紧环绕着他，仿佛他是唯一能让她在汹涌的情感海洋中保持平衡的锚。“嘘，”他在她耳边低语，温柔地拥抱着她，“没事的，明日香。没事的。”

They remained like that long into the night.  
他们就这样一直相拥到深夜。

Misato Katsuragi was feeling the pain of a long night of drinking when Kaji Ryoji dropped her off at her apartment the next day.  
明日香·索耶醒来时，发现自己躺在一张陌生的床上，头痛欲裂。她试图回忆昨晚发生了什么，但记忆如同被橡皮擦过一般，只剩下模糊的片段。她记得自己在酒吧里喝酒，然后遇到了一个自称是碇真嗣的男人。他们聊得很开心，然后……然后就什么也不记得了。

Entering the small apartment, she expected to find the remnants of a cooking disaster.  Surprise broke through the haze as she walked into a spotless kitchen, everything put away and cleaned.  There was absolutely no sign that a supposedly spineless wimp had tried to teach the great Asuka Soryu Langely how to cook.  
她挣扎着坐起身，发现自己穿着一件男士衬衫，显然不是她的衣服。她环顾四周，发现这是一个简洁而整洁的房间，墙上挂着几幅抽象画，书架上摆满了书籍。她意识到自己可能是在碇真嗣的家里。

Looking in the refrigerator for a beer, however, she found a cake.  It was untouched, yet looked absolutely delicious.  Taking it out, she set in on the counter, momentarily forgetting the beer.   
她下了床，赤脚走在冰凉的地板上，试图找到浴室。当她经过客厅时，她看到了碇真嗣坐在沙发上，正专注地看着电视。他听到声音，转过头来，看到明日香站在那里，脸上露出了惊讶的表情。

Shinji Ikari awoke in his room, wondering if last night had been a dream.  
碇真嗣在自己的房间里醒来，疑惑昨晚是否只是一场梦。

The soft weight on his chest, and the scattering of red hair under his chin assured him that it hadn't been.    
胸口那轻柔的重量，以及下巴下散落的红色发丝让他确信那并非梦境。

Asuka was snoring softly, her breathing deep and even.  She was snuggled up against him, her body warm, and her face content.  A gentle smile was on her face, and he had never seen her so beautiful as she was in that moment.   
明日香轻轻地打着呼噜，呼吸深沉而平稳。她紧紧依偎在他身边，身体温暖，面容满足。她脸上挂着温柔的微笑，那一刻，他从未见过她如此美丽。

Shinji couldn't help himself.  Leaning his head down, he pressed a kiss to her forehead, eliciting a sleepy mumble at having to wake up.  Her eyes slowly opened, their blue depths meeting his own.  Her smile grew even bigger as she gave him a squeeze, her arms wrapping around him as if her were some sort of giant teddy bear.  "Good morning," she whispered, resting her head against his chest once again.  "Did you sleep ok?"  
真嗣情不自禁。他低下头，在她额头上轻轻一吻，引得她迷迷糊糊地咕哝了一声，似乎被吵醒了。她的眼睛缓缓睁开，蓝色的深邃与他的目光相遇。她的笑容更加灿烂，双臂紧紧抱住他，仿佛他是一只巨大的泰迪熊。“早上好，”她低声说道，再次将头靠在他的胸前。“睡得好吗？”

Actually, he had.  Used to having to drown out his thought with the drone of his DAT player, he found that he felt more rested than he had in a long time.  Sleep didn't come easily to him, and last night, he was free from the nightmares that normally plagued his mind.  
实际上，他睡得很好。习惯了用 DAT 播放器的嗡嗡声淹没自己的思绪，他发现自己比很久以来都更加精神饱满。睡眠对他来说并不容易，而昨晚，他摆脱了通常困扰他心灵的噩梦。

"Yes, Asuka-chan."   “是的，明日香。”

His eyes widened.  He hadn't even thought about what he'd said.  
他的眼睛睁大了。他甚至没想过自己说了什么。

His fears subsided, as she looked up once again.  "That's good, Shinji-kun."  
随着她再次抬头，他的恐惧消退了。“那很好，真嗣君。”

She sat up, grinning.  "Come on, sleepy head!  I'm hungry!  You can teach me how to make waffles!"  
她坐起身，咧嘴笑着。“快点，瞌睡虫！我饿了！你可以教我怎么做华夫饼！”

"Sleepy-head?  I woke up before you did!"  
"懒虫？我可比你先醒呢！"

Laughing, the two made their way towards the kitchen.  They entered it to find an empty cake platter, and one very asleep and content looking NERV Major, chocolate smudged around the corners of her mouth.  The Children's jaws dropped as the took in the scene.  
两人笑着走向厨房。他们一进门就看到一个空荡荡的蛋糕盘，还有一个睡得正香、满脸满足的 NERV 少校，嘴角沾着巧克力。孩子们看到这一幕，下巴都快掉下来了。

As one, they yelled.  "MISATO!!!"  
他们齐声大喊：“美里！！！”

~The End~ ~完结撒花~

Author's Notes 作者笔记

Well, I finally finished it, as I've promised.  I wanted the ending to be happy, and for Shinji and Asuka to get together, obviously.  I know that this is a rather short fic, but I'm still new as an author, and learning to flesh out my stories more than I have been.  While I really want to write an epic, 40+ chapter saga, I'm simply not ready as a writer to do so yet, though I'm working on an idea for one as you read this.  I really enjoyed writing this, and I hope you enjoyed reading it.  I had no idea that this would have the feedback that it did, garnering over 70 reviews, and helping to make me a better writer.  
好了，我终于完成了这个承诺。我想要一个快乐的结局，显然，让真嗣和明日香在一起。我知道这篇同人文相当短，但我作为作者还是新手，正在学习如何将故事写得更充实。虽然我真的很想写一部史诗般的、超过 40 章的传奇故事，但作为作家，我目前还没有准备好，尽管你阅读这篇文章时，我正在构思一个这样的想法。我真的很享受写作的过程，希望你们也能享受阅读。我没想到这篇作品会收到如此多的反馈，获得了超过 70 条评论，帮助我成为了一个更好的作家。

As with most things, lots of thanks are in order.  I want to thank Andris, Corvus, Phht, gbeans, and NefCanuck for helping me with this story.  Their continued harassment to finish this has helped me to do so.  Thanks to Danielle, my girlfriend, for being one of my chief editors.  You've helped me more than you know, babe.   
与大多数事情一样，需要感谢很多人。我要感谢 Andris、Corvus、Phht、gbeans 和 NefCanuck，他们在这篇故事中给予了我帮助。他们持续的催促让我完成了它。感谢我的女朋友 Danielle，作为我的主要编辑之一。宝贝，你帮我的比我意识到的还要多。

A very special thanks to all the reviewers.  If it wasn't for all of those comments and thoughts, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish this.  
特别感谢所有评论者。如果没有那些评论和想法，我可能无法完成这部作品。

A side story, mayhaps of a lemony nature, _may be in the works.  As for when it would be out, I can't say, as I have never written such a work before._   
或许会有一篇番外，也许是柠檬味的性质。至于何时发布，我无法确定，因为我之前从未写过这样的作品。

Last but not least, thanks to Random1377 and Lord Deatscythe, for their support and inspiration.  You can find their works at www.evafics.org and www.darkscribes.org  
最后但同样重要的是，感谢 Random1377 和 Lord Deatscythe 的支持与灵感。你可以在 www.evafics.org 和 www.darkscribes.org 找到他们的作品。

Thank you for coming, and goodnight, ladies and gentlemen.  Kumo has left the building.  
感谢各位的光临，晚安，女士们先生们。Kumo 已经离开了现场。

### Comment
[Rose1948](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1280309/Rose1948): Cool little story! *foflmao* Misato ate the all of the cake?  
很酷的小故事！*笑翻了* 美里把蛋糕全吃了？

[fhngdfrydkuti](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1206358/fhngdfrydkuti): This is a wonderful story, I'd give it an 8.9. -0.1 for spelling and gramatical mistakes, and -1 as a sign that you can always do better. Truth is, this is one of the better stories I have read, but on the flip side, as an author, you should take a little more time to review your stories before posting them, to cut out on errors such as DAT player, instead of SDAT player. Regardless though, this was a very well written story. Kudos.  
这是一篇精彩的故事，我会给它打 8.9 分。扣 0.1 分是因为拼写和语法错误，再扣 1 分表示你总能做得更好。事实上，这是我读过的比较好的故事之一，但另一方面，作为作者，你应该在发布前多花点时间审阅你的故事，以减少诸如 DAT 播放器而不是 SDAT 播放器这样的错误。尽管如此，这仍然是一篇写得非常好的故事。赞！

[escudo-blade](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/483618/escudo-blade):
I don't usually read, or enjoy, the Asuka and Shinji pairing. However, the idea behind this fic seemed original, so I decided to read it. It is one of the few good evangelion fics on this site. Now that my praise has been given to you, I will also share my criticism.  
我通常不读，也不喜欢明日香和真嗣的配对。然而，这篇同人文的想法似乎很新颖，所以我决定一读。这是本网站上为数不多的优秀 EVA 同人文之一。既然我已经给予了赞扬，我也会分享我的批评意见。  
  
Shinji has been introverted, lonely, self-loathing, self-ashamed, and spineless his ENTIRE life, and I feel that the change within him in your story happened a little fast. He's been made worthless by his father, his teachers, and possible love interests(Rei, Asuka, and in some cases, Hikari), which is something that would probably take a lot of time and/or therapy to fix.  
真嗣一生都是内向、孤独、自我厌恶、自我羞愧且缺乏骨气的，我觉得你故事中他的转变发生得有点太快了。他被父亲、老师以及可能的恋爱对象（绫波、明日香，甚至在某些情况下，还有光）塑造成了无价值的人，这通常需要大量的时间和/或心理治疗才能改变。  
  
I liked how you gave a reason for Asuka being the mean-spirited person that she was towards Shinji, but remember that she was also less trusting and emotionally detached since she witnessed the suicide of her mother. She lived that way for years, which is also something that is hard to fix.  
我喜欢你为明日香对真嗣刻薄的原因所做的解释，但别忘了，她自从目睹母亲自杀后，就一直不太信任他人且情感疏离。她这样生活了很多年，这也是一个难以改变的问题。  
  
Note: I think the above items could be fixed by adding (slight AU)in your summary. You probably know this, but AU stands for Alternate Universe.  
注意：我认为上述问题可以通过在你的摘要中添加（轻微 AU）来解决。你可能已经知道，但 AU 代表的是平行宇宙。

anonynous: truly one of the most inspiational and well written stories i've ever read. while remaining true to the characters, you have managed to give Shinji-kun courage through his art and to bring Asuka-chan closer to her own heart as a result of a simple cooking lesson. this story was exceedingly well written in terms of humor and comprehensibility. the scenes were excellent and quite memorable. a true gem of the literary/fanfiction realm. thank you for this piece.  
这确实是我读过的最具启发性和文笔优美的故事之一。在忠于原角色的同时，你通过艺术赋予了真嗣勇气，并通过一次简单的烹饪课让明日香更接近自己的内心。这篇故事在幽默感和易懂性方面写得非常出色。场景精彩且令人难忘。是文学/同人领域的一颗明珠。感谢你的这篇作品。

[Shiakou](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/430194/Shiakou): Wow, this has to be one of the best short stories I have ever read. It's nice to finally see something like this. All of the pilots' personal problems and their EVA's being discussed yet over something like cooking is both novel and brilliant. And you pulled it off! Great job! And I can't even begin to comment on how sweet that was. . .  
哇，这绝对是我读过的最好的短篇小说之一。终于能看到这样的作品真是太好了。所有驾驶员的个人问题和他们 EVA 的讨论，却围绕着烹饪这样的话题，既新颖又精彩。而你成功地做到了！干得漂亮！我甚至无法开始评论那有多甜蜜……

[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): One of the best dinner scenes I've seen and the build up was great. Now I for one think that 14 year old kid may sleep toghethe but actuially have sex,?I'd say theres a 25% probability. I think they would snuggles kiss and touch but going all the way. Na.otherwise I think you should continue as you kinda leave it in the middle of the series storyline. Why not continue it!  
这是我见过的最棒的晚餐场景之一，铺垫也非常精彩。我个人认为，那个 14 岁的孩子可能会睡在一起，但实际上并没有发生性关系，对吧？我觉得有 25%的可能性。我想他们会拥抱、亲吻和抚摸，但要发展到那一步，不太可能。另外，我觉得你应该继续写下去，因为你似乎把故事留在了系列情节的中间。为什么不继续呢！


[AN Seranov](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/277823/AN-Seranov):
I'm sorry I didn't review earlier. Just kinda slipped my mind. But here's the first thing that came to mind after Chapter 3: DAMN THAT WAS AWESOME!  
很抱歉我没能早点评论，只是有点忘了。但在看完Chapter 3 后，我脑子里第一个冒出来的念头是：真他妈的太棒了！  
  
You have a way with words that I find very interesting. You apparently know how to cook, and it shows in the way you handle the scenes in the kitchen.  
你的言辞颇有魅力，让我觉得非常有趣。显然你懂得烹饪，这在处理厨房场景时表现得淋漓尽致。  
  
Shinji seems OOC, but we never actually see him cooking anything complex. I am happy that he can seem rather contented. The kid sees a lot of bad stuff during Eva, and he deserves some nice stuff like this. Other than Shinji's accountable OOC-ness, everyone is beautifully in character...  
真嗣似乎有些出戏，但我们从未真正看到他烹饪复杂的食物。我很高兴他能显得如此满足。这孩子在 EVA 中经历了太多糟糕的事情，他值得拥有这样美好的时刻。除了真嗣可理解的出戏之外，其他角色都表现得非常到位...  
  
And even _I_ was breathing nervously after Shinji wispering in Asuka's ear. That's good characterization right there.  
甚至在真嗣对着明日香耳语之后，连我都紧张得屏住了呼吸。这就是出色的角色塑造。  
  
Keep it up. This one's got my attention and ain't letting go.  
继续保持。这个引起了我的注意，不会轻易放手。

Helper:
Hmm. I like your style, Kumorigoe.  
嗯。我喜欢你的风格，黑子。  
  
Grammatically, you've got it. Your biggest (and only) problem that I see is your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.  
从语法上讲，你掌握得不错。我看到你最大的（也是唯一的）问题是倾向于用介词结束句子。  
  
Structurally, I find that you tend to have shorter paragraphs, based mostly around dialogue. This is understandable, since it is, after all, based on a T.V. show, which gives a visual setting. Work on incorperating more action into your paragraphs and I think you'll get better characterization. Varying your sentence structure could also help. I like how you've managed your deliberate fragments, but switching it up between compound, simple and complex sentence structure is always a good idea.  
从结构上看，我发现你倾向于写较短的段落，主要围绕对话展开。这可以理解，毕竟这是基于电视节目，提供了视觉背景。试着在你的段落中加入更多动作，我认为你的角色塑造会更好。变换句子结构也会有帮助。我喜欢你如何处理那些刻意的片段，但混合使用复合句、简单句和复杂句结构总是一个好主意。  
  
Lastly, and this could just be me, I find your characterization of Shinji a little unbelievable. This is okay. After all, it's fanfiction and is expected to vary from the series a little. But I think with more action, perhaps more explanation, you will have a very believable Shinji. Your portrayal of Asuka is wonderful, by the way.  
最后，这可能只是我的个人看法，我觉得你对真嗣的角色塑造有点难以置信。这没关系。毕竟这是同人小说，与原作有些出入是正常的。但我认为，通过更多的动作描写，或许再加上一些解释，你会塑造出一个非常可信的真嗣。顺便说一句，你对明日香的刻画非常出色。  
  
Basically, you've got it. You've taken an original idea, using a significant event instead of just going day to day, and you've worked with it. Give us a more definitive theme, something to take from the fic once we leave your site, back it up with imagery, and you're well on your way to writing like an expert. For only having been doing it for a year, you're quite verbose, and I truly enjoy reading your work.  
基本上，你已经掌握了。你采用了一个原创的想法，利用了一个重大事件而不是日复一日，并且你很好地处理了它。给我们一个更明确的主题，让我们在离开你的网站后还能从中获得些什么，用意象来支撑它，你已经在成为专家级作家的路上走得很远了。仅仅做了一年，你就已经非常详尽，我真的很喜欢阅读你的作品。

[Sadistic Shadow](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/96056/Sadistic-Shadow):
Ara, ara... 哎呀呀...  
  
Would you beleive silly little me read this entire fanfiction without once noting the author's pen name? Imagine my shock when I found that you were the one who wrote it.  
你能相信我这个傻乎乎的小家伙居然读完了整篇同人文，却一次都没注意到作者的笔名吗？当我发现原来是你写的时，真是大吃一惊。  
  
I see you took a break from the Love Hina section? Well, though I adore your aforementioned fanfics, I might have to insist that you take more breaks to work on this.  
看来你从《纯情房东俏房客》那部分休息了一下？虽然我非常喜欢你之前的同人文，但我可能得坚持让你多休息，来创作这个。  
  
*smirks evilly* Insist indeed.  
*邪恶地一笑* 确实坚持。  
  
Now, to comment on the fic itself. As with all your works, I positively loved it. You know, even before I took a peek at the author, something felt oddly familiar about the writing style. Anyway, the characterization was pretty good for the most part. There wasn't too much 'OOC' at all (and technically, you can't do an Eva fic, or any other fic, for that matter, without venturing a tiny bit out of their character in order to allow changes) if any.  
现在，来评论一下这篇同人文本身。就像你所有的作品一样，我非常喜欢。你知道吗，甚至在看到作者之前，我就觉得这写作风格有些莫名的熟悉。总之，大部分角色的塑造都很不错。几乎没有太多‘OOC’（而且严格来说，写《EVA》同人文，或者任何其他同人文，都难免会稍微偏离角色原本的性格，以便允许一些变化），如果有的话。  
  
The title was pretty kawaii, and though I'm something of an angst fan, it was real nice to read a 'cutesy' A/S fic.  
标题非常可爱，虽然我是个喜欢悲剧的人，但读到一篇‘甜蜜’的 A/S 同人文感觉真的很不错。  
  
All-in-all, very good. I suggest you continue this. And fast. Remember: I know what major sections you haunt now.  
总的来说，非常不错。我建议你继续写下去，而且要快。记住：我知道你现在常逛哪些大板块。  
  
Ahh yes...the beloved murder burger and I bid thee farewell...For now...  
啊哈，是的...那备受喜爱的杀人汉堡，我们暂且告别...不久后见...  
  
*insert puffle of thick smoke, lots of humorous gagging, and one hell of a disappearing act here*  
*插入一团浓烟，大量幽默的窒息声，以及一次绝妙的消失表演*

look. look. look. 看。看。看。  
  
I'M LOOKING DAMNIT NOW WHEN CAN I EAT IT!  
我在看呢，该死的！什么时候能吃啊！  
  
lol I love italian food... we all lvoe itallian food... AHOY ALL GUYS WITH WALTER P39s! o whatever that's all i can remember about Italians except for food :P  
哈哈，我喜欢意大利菜...我们都喜欢意大利菜...喂，所有拿着沃尔特 P39 的人！哦，我除了意大利菜就只记得这些了 :P  
  
anyways story goes so darned well, it's not boring, not the least, cuz many good stories have a bit droning/boring quality to it. it's too good... u made me feel like eating something... my saliva glands are workingg so hard now... aiya, this must be what my dog feels when he sees us eat... anyways back to the story, as i said, it's really nice, i would say u'd rather have one longer version of the story, because you're story isn't too good for chapters, u'd turn evangelion into a cook show (nothin wrong about that i knwow *drools*) either that or a few small chapts, because if u make it too long it's not really as good, unless u want us to think that evangelion is surrounded by food... and besides angel attacks occur quite often so i think this story is taking between a very short time, and not spread out, cuz Asuka's going into coma and hate everything quite soon i think, just my opinion of course, and if u don't like the opinion about keeping this short, take the one about food... we are all food... food... food... food...  
总之故事进展得如此顺利，一点也不无聊，至少很多好故事都有点单调/乏味的特质。它太棒了...你让我有种想吃东西的感觉...我的唾液腺现在工作得如此努力...哎呀，这一定是我家狗看到我们吃东西时的感觉...言归正传，正如我所说，故事真的很棒，我倒觉得你不妨写一个更长的版本，因为你的故事并不适合分成章节，你简直能把《新世纪福音战士》变成一档烹饪节目（这没什么不好的，我知道*流口水*），或者分成几个小章节，因为如果写得太长就不那么精彩了，除非你想让我们觉得《新世纪福音战士》周围全是食物...而且天使袭击相当频繁，所以我觉得这个故事发生在很短的时间内，没有铺开，因为明日香很快就会陷入昏迷并憎恨一切，当然这只是我的看法，如果你不喜欢这个关于保持简短的意见，那就采纳关于食物的那个...我们都是食物...食物...食物...食物...

[Evanhellion](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/369623/Evanhellion): Very Enterestinkh... Seriously, though. Very good job here, I always like to see character evolution instead of just pure "drop and go" OOC-ness. The alfredo was a good choice, white sauce pasta is always good for a first date. Yes, we would definitely like to see another chapter. Let me be the first to suggest "The frying Deutschman" as a title. (The flying dutchman. Pun. Bad, I know. Shoot me.) Keep it up!  
说真的，做得很好。我总是喜欢看到角色的成长，而不是单纯的“突然出现又消失”的 OOC 行为。阿尔弗雷多酱是个不错的选择，白酱意面总是适合初次约会。是的，我们肯定希望能看到另一篇chapter。让我第一个提议，标题可以是“煎炸的德国人”（飞翔的荷兰人，双关语，我知道很糟糕，开枪打我吧）。继续加油！

[Alabaster Plum](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/371563/Alabaster-Plum): Very nice for a short fic, and I liked how you actually had Asuka being kind and attracted to Shinji, yet still in character. It's also nice to see Shinji with a backbone, though not to the point where he's cursing or being violent (ehh.. I've read quite a few interesting fics). It was short, but still very enjoyable and sweet.  
作为一篇短篇小说非常出色，我喜欢你如何让明日香展现出温柔和对真嗣的吸引，同时保持了她的性格。看到真嗣有骨气也很好，尽管没有到咒骂或暴力的程度（呃...我读过不少有趣的同人文）。虽然简短，但依然非常愉快和甜蜜。
