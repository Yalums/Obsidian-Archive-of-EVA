An indepth account of what happened during the three days Asuka and Shinji had to synchronize.  
详细记录了明日香和真嗣需要同步的三天里所发生的事情。

I'm going to say right now, this is going to be a Shinji/Asuka fic written from Asuka's POV. I like this coupling very much because the chemistry is so obvious it smacking you upside the head.  
我现在就要声明，这将是一篇从明日香视角出发的碇真嗣/明日香同人文。我非常喜欢这对组合，因为他们之间的化学反应明显到几乎要敲打你的脑袋。

While I'm new to the Evangelion fandom, I am not new to writing. I've dabbled in Rurouni Kenshin and a tiny bit of YST before this. But that doesn't mean I'm perfect. Please give me constructive criticism. The Evangelion section of ff.net is reputed to have very honest critics, and I want to put that to the test. I'm tired of inane reviews that say in previous fandoms that say "Writ mre ongai!!!!!!" Am I the only one who thinks these are pointless?  
虽然我是新加入《新世纪福音战士》粉丝圈的，但我并非写作新手。在此之前，我涉猎过《浪客剑心》，还有一点点《幽游白书》。但这并不意味着我完美无缺。请给我建设性的批评。ff.net 上的《新世纪福音战士》区以直言不讳的评论者著称，我希望能验证这一点。我厌倦了那些在前几个粉丝圈中常见的无意义评论，比如“快写更多！！！！”难道只有我觉得这些毫无意义吗？

Special thanks to **Blue Taboo** for pre reading my chapters. I'm a stubborn writer when it comes to listening to my prereader, but she put up with my shyte =) "Evangelion phangrrls unite!"  
特别感谢 Blue Taboo 提前阅读我的章节。我在听取预读者的意见时很固执，但她容忍了我的胡闹 =) “福音战士女孩们团结起来！”

**Prelude 前奏**

"Actually, this was Kaji's idea."  
“实际上，这是加持的主意。”

"Kaji's?" Captain Katsuragi Misato eyed the disk warily. One part of her said that the man was not to be trusted, but the other part was worrying about her job. Misato hated to admit it, but for once, she had no plan.  
"加治的？" 葛城美里上尉警惕地看着那张光盘。她的一部分直觉告诉她这个人不可信，但另一部分却在担心自己的工作。美里讨厌承认这一点，但这一次，她毫无计划。

Besides... maybe it would humor her. Maybe serve as a healthy distraction from the load of rubbish on the desktop.  
再说了……也许这会让她开心。也许能作为一个健康的分心，从桌面上那一堆垃圾中解脱出来。

Misato traced the outline of the stamped heart nostalgically before shoving it into the disk drive. Long silences with only the clicking of the keyboard did bad things to buried emotions. "Now, let's see what we have here."  
美里怀念地沿着印有心的轮廓划过，然后将它塞进光驱。长时间的沉默，只有键盘的点击声，对埋藏的情感有不好的影响。 "现在，让我们看看这里有什么。"

The cursor flashed on the screen of the Microsoft WordPerfect document. Misato smiled, Kaji was always the type to go with ancient programs like this. Even the disk itself was outdated. Odd, considering he was always with the current computer trend in college.  
光标在 Microsoft WordPerfect 文档的屏幕上闪烁。美里微笑着，加持总是那种喜欢使用古老程序的人。就连磁盘本身也过时了。奇怪，考虑到他在大学时总是紧跟最新的电脑潮流。

"To my dearest honey," she read. "Here is the brilliant idea that you need." Misato snorted. "Always the smooth talker." She kept reading.  
“致我最亲爱的甜心，”她念道，“这是你需要的绝妙主意。”美里嗤之以鼻，“总是这么油嘴滑舌。”她继续读下去。

_I know that you have a little faith in me if you got this disk. At least give me that much credit.  
我知道如果你拿到这张磁盘，你对我还有一点信心。至少给我这点信任吧。_

_She briefly contemplated closing the program, but decided against it. Despite exterior shows, Kaji was actually a very capable man. At least a possible bad idea was better than what she had, which was nothing. "Fine, I'll go along with this, but it better be good."_
她短暂地考虑过关闭程序，但最终决定不这么做。尽管外表上有所掩饰，但加持实际上是一个非常能干的人。至少一个可能的坏主意也比她现在什么都没有要好。“好吧，我会配合这个计划，但希望它真的有用。”

_You and I both know that we have more than one problem on our hands with the arrival of the Second Child. Things have been complicated more with the seventh Angel's seeming indestructibility,_
你我都知道，随着第二适格者的到来，我们手头的问题不止一个。第七使徒看似无法摧毁的特性更是让事情变得复杂。

___

Misato quirked an eyebrow. That sounded like he was using a thesaurus. So unlike Kaji. "I guess we've both changed... right?" It amazed her how he could turn from flirtatious to business-like in half the time it took to blink an eye.  
美里挑了挑眉。听起来他像是在用词典。这可不像加持。“我想我们都变了……对吧？”他能在眨眼间从轻浮转为严肃，这让她感到惊讶。

_but I have a plan to take care of two things at the same time. As you know, Asuka is quite adamant about staying with me for the duration of her station here.  
但我有个计划，可以同时解决两个问题。如你所知，明日香坚持要在这段时间内和我住在一起。_

_She nearly laughed at this one. Misato had quite a time trying to convince Asuka that Evangelion pilots can either live alone or live with an authorized NERV personnel. Asuka shot back that Kaji was just as authorized as any personnel. He was working in the Special Investigations Unit, and therefore made a suitable guardian. That had Misato at a loss of words. She was right._
她几乎要笑出声来。美里费了好大劲才说服明日香，说她可以独自生活或与 NERV 授权人员同住。明日香反驳说，加持和任何人员一样有权。他在特别调查部门工作，因此是一个合适的监护人。这让美里无言以对。她说的没错。

_I don't think Asuka will be very happy staying with me here, and I don't wish for her to be unhappy._
我不认为明日香住在这里会感到很开心，我也不希望她不快乐。_

_"Hah!" Misato really did laugh at her screen this time. "You just don't want her staying with you, and trying to make it _look like she won't be happy. The only person you're concerned about here is yourself!" She grinned again before it slowly dropped from her face. "You're always quite the martyr. Always have been."_  
“哈！”美里这次真的对着屏幕笑出声来，“你只是不想让她和你住，还试图装作她不会开心。你在这里唯一关心的只有你自己！”她再次咧嘴一笑，随后笑容慢慢从脸上消失，“你总是这么个殉道者模样，一直如此。”

_Now she was starting to wonder about Israfel, the seventh Angel. This didn't sound like an operation to save her job, it sounded like a rant of injustice against the world._
现在她开始对第七使徒伊斯拉斐尔感到好奇了。这听起来不像是为了保住工作的行动，倒像是对世界不公的抱怨。

_We can kill two birds with one stone. Or, we can kill two half Angels with one mind.  
我们可以一石二鸟。或者，我们可以用一个头脑消灭两个半使徒。_

_That caught her attention. Where was he getting at? And what in the world did this have to do with Asuka's place to stay?_
这引起了她的注意。他到底想说什么？这和明日香住处的问题又有什么关系呢？

_I propose that..._
我提议……

_Misato's eyes widened._
美里瞪大了眼睛。_

**To My Dearest Honey  
致我最亲爱的宝贝**By: Karina Kineshi (coronaflare@mail.com)  
作者：Karina Kineshi (coronaflare@mail.com)

Just getting back from my first synch test in this strange country, I came to one conclusion. Japanese certainly were weird. Of course, I had the highest synch ratio, but I was steadily getting more and more worried. Whereas my points could only increase by a small percentage, Shinji's seemed to be growing rapidly. It was clear in the face of the blonde haired woman looking at the percentages. It would still be a while until he could catch up with me though, but I was still scared.  
刚从这个陌生国度完成我的首次同步测试回来，我得出一个结论。日本人确实很奇怪。当然，我的同步率是最高的，但我越来越担心。我的分数只能小幅增长，而真嗣的分数却迅速上升。这一点在金发女子查看百分比时显而易见。尽管他还需要一段时间才能赶上我，但我仍然感到害怕。

_It's best not to think about such things now.  
现在最好不要想这些事。_

_

The blue haired pilot, they said Ayanami Rei was her name, had already showered and left. I glared disdainfully at the curtain that separated the men's from the women's locker rooms. I could see Shinji's outline on the other side, drying himself off. Those NERV provided towels had to have been washed with no fabric softener with all the abrasions on my skin...  
那个蓝发的飞行员，他们说她叫绫波零，已经洗完澡离开了。我鄙夷地瞪着那块分隔男女更衣室的帘子。我能看到另一边真嗣的身影，正在擦干自己。那些 NERV 提供的毛巾肯定是没有用柔顺剂洗过的，看看我皮肤上的擦伤就知道了……

"Shinji!" I yelled. "Are you still over there, idiot?" I could hear a wooden bench being dragged across the ground from the other side. Why, I didn't know. "Hey Shinji!"  
“真嗣！”我喊道，“你还在那边吗，白痴？”我能听到另一边木凳被拖动的声音。为什么，我不知道。“嘿，真嗣！”

A shadow came over the curtain. "Yes? What is it, Asuka?"  
一个影子投在帘子上。“什么事，明日香？”

I smiled maliciously. I quickly learned that he was a perfect whetstone to sharpen my insults and snide remarks on. He was dull and didn't fight back. "You broke your highest synch ratio when you were with me. Does that prove anything?"  
我恶意地笑了。我很快发现，他是磨砺我讽刺和挖苦的完美磨刀石。他迟钝且不反击。“你和我在一起时打破了最高同步率，这能证明什么？”

Shinji tried to come up with a response, but he just ended up stammering. "I... I d-don't know..."  
真嗣试图想出一个回应，但最终只是结巴起来。“我...我...不...不知道...”

"Are you stupid?" I sat down and put my socks on. The smugness never left my voice. "It's because you were with the best."  
“你是不是傻？”我坐下穿上了袜子，自鸣得意的语气丝毫未减。“那是因为你和最优秀的人在一起。”

The shadow disappeared from the curtain, and I thought he left. I heard a meek, "Yeah, I guess so."  
影子从窗帘上消失了，我以为他离开了。我听到一个怯懦的声音，“嗯，我想是的。”

Ikari Shinji, the Third Child. Just what was the deal with that boy anyway? I'd never met someone so spineless before. From the moment I first laid eyes on him, he exuded a sickening humble attitude that disgusted me. One can't be humble to get anywhere in life.  
碇真嗣，第三适格者。那个男孩到底是怎么回事？我从未见过如此懦弱的人。从我第一次见到他开始，他就散发出一种令人作呕的谦卑态度，让我感到厌恶。一个人在生活中不能过于谦卑。

Looks like he hadn't learned that yet. He _has no life._  
看来他还没学会这一点。他毫无生活可言。

_

"I'm going home now, Asuka."  
"我现在要回家了，明日香。"

I snorted. Living with that woman wasn't exactly what I would call a home. From what Kaji tells me, the woman practically bathes in alcohol. I always thought it was a disgusting habit. The first time a college boy offered me a beer, I took a whiff of it and almost threw up. How can anyone get that liquid down their throat? Even in Germany, I didn't really like drinking. I had better things to do that get drunk off my ass. "Fine. Leave."  
我嗤之以鼻。和那个女人住在一起，我可不觉得那是家。据加持所说，她几乎是在酒精里泡澡。我一直认为这是个令人作呕的习惯。第一次有大学生请我喝啤酒时，我闻了闻就差点吐出来。怎么有人能咽下那种液体？即使在德国，我也不怎么喜欢喝酒。我有更好的事情要做，而不是喝得烂醉如泥。“好吧。你走吧。”

He only shoved his duffel bag onto his shoulder. "Do you want me to stay?"  
他只是把他的行李袋甩到肩上。“你想让我留下吗？”

"What? Are you waiting for me to come out naked?" Another wonderful opportunity. How I loved watching men succumb to my charm.  
“什么？你是在等我裸着出来吗？”又一个绝佳机会。我多么喜欢看那些男人屈服于我的魅力之下。

Shinji stammered again. "N-No! It's j-just that you sounded l-like—"  
真嗣又结巴了。“不、不是！只是你听起来像——”

I sounded like what?  
我听起来像什么？

"I don't want you to stay and get a glimpse of my beautiful body! You... you pervert!" I screamed and threw my shoe at the curtain. Unfortunately, it didn't hit him; the shoe slid down the curtain and clattered to the ground on the other side. "That should teach you! Go home!"  
"我才不要你留下来偷看我美丽的身体！你……你这个变态！" 我尖叫着把鞋子扔向窗帘。不幸的是，鞋子没砸中他；鞋子顺着窗帘滑落，在另一边咣当一声掉在地上。"这回你该长记性了！回家去吧！"

There was silence on the other side. He probably already left. I sighed, he was lucky that he had a home to go to. Right now, I was indefinitely stationed right here in headquarters. Kaji said that he was making arrangements to find a guardian for me. I asked if he could be my guardian. "Just think of it!" I said. "A guardian to the great Sohryu Asuka Langley!"  
另一边陷入了沉默。他大概已经走了。我叹了口气，他真幸运，还有个家可回。现在，我被无限期地驻扎在总部。加持说他在安排为我找一个监护人。我问他能不能做我的监护人。"想想看吧！" 我说。"成为伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的监护人！"

He said he'd think about it.  
他说他会考虑的。

I saw something move on the other side of the curtain. It stooped over and picked up my shoe. Once the familiar beaten tennis shoes came into view, I knew at once who it was. "Kaji!" Involuntarily, I shot to my feet and raced to the curtain. The one shoe I had on slapped against the ground, and I cursed myself for having all my clothes on.  
我看到帘子另一边有什么东西在动。它弯下腰，捡起了我的鞋子。当那双熟悉的破旧网球鞋映入眼帘时，我立刻认出了是谁。“加持！”我不由自主地跳起来，冲向帘子。我脚上仅剩的一只鞋啪嗒啪嗒地拍打着地面，我暗骂自己怎么穿好了所有衣服。

"You're still in there?" He nearly fell backwards when I threw open the curtain and wrapped my arms around his arm. The shoe in his hand fell to the floor. "Asuka!"  
“你还在里面？”我猛地拉开帘子，一把抱住他的手臂，他差点向后摔倒。他手中的鞋子掉到了地上。“明日香！”

I grinned at him. "Of course! I was waiting here for you!" I let go and peered at him expectantly. "Well? What did they say about the guardianship thing? I can't _wait to start living with you."_  
我朝他咧嘴一笑。“当然！我在这里等你呢！”我松开手，期待地看着他。“那么？他们怎么说监护权的事？我迫不及待想开始和你一起生活了。”

_

Kaji scratched the back of his head, something he always did when he had to come up with an excuse quickly. My heart fell, they denied it. Why would they deny me the right to live with my Kaji? It's my choice to make, not theirs! I found myself getting angry before he even said anything, but I kept that smile on my face.  
加治挠了挠后脑勺，这是他每次需要迅速找借口时总会做的动作。我的心沉了下去，他们拒绝了。为什么他们要剥夺我和加治一起生活的权利？这是我自己的选择，不是他们的！我发现自己在他还没说什么之前就开始生气了，但我还是保持着脸上的微笑。

He always said the world would be better if pretty women always smiled.  
他总是说，如果漂亮的女人总是微笑，世界会变得更美好。

"Ah... actually, Commander Ikari was swamped with work. He said that he'd get to it when he was done."  
“啊... 实际上，碇司令工作很忙。他说等忙完了就会处理这件事。”

I narrowed my eyes. "This stupid thing involves the Commander?" I couldn't believe it. Couldn't he get one of his underlings to do this work for him? This was such a petty concern, one that someone under him can easily solve.  
"我眯起眼睛。“这愚蠢的事情牵扯到指挥官？”我简直不敢相信。难道他不能让他的一个下属来做这项工作吗？这不过是个微不足道的问题，他手下的人轻而易举就能解决。”

Kaji must have read my thoughts, because then he added, "It involves him because the security of one of the most important persons may be at jeopardy."  
加持一定是看穿了我的想法，因为他接着说：“牵扯到他是因为某位极其重要人物的安全可能受到威胁。”

"The most important person." I corrected. "And the best damn Eva pilot."  
“最重要的人。”我纠正道。“还有最棒的 EVA 驾驶员。”

He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled that megawatt grin. The one that made me sigh like a teenage schoolgirl. "Right. These decisions shouldn't be taken lightly, you know."  
他把手搭在我的肩上，露出了那个光芒四射的笑容。那个让我像青春期少女一样叹息的笑容。“对。这些决定不应该轻率，你知道的。”

It made perfect sense. I nodded and went back to my things in the women's room. Kaji didn't follow me, but I was hoping he would. Once I stuffed an extra plugsuit into my duffel bag, I turned around and flashed him a victory sign. I was as good as in whenever Commander Ikari gave permission to proceed. "I'll be in your house soon before you know it! Me _and all my things!"_  
这完全合情合理。我点点头，回到女更衣室整理我的东西。加持没有跟来，但我希望他会。当我把一件额外的战斗服塞进我的行李袋后，我转过身向他比了个胜利的手势。只要碇司令一允许，我就随时可以加入。“很快我就会在你家了！我和我所有的东西！”

_

Hey, a girl can't travel light. He gave me an uneasy smile. It was probably because he's seen my things before and knew that they took up a lot of room. "Yeah..."  
嘿，女孩子可不能轻装上阵。他给了我一个不安的微笑。可能是因为他以前见过我的东西，知道它们占了不少空间。“是啊...”

That was the last thing he said before the rooms were drenched in red light.  
那是他在房间被红光浸透前说的最后一句话。

*****

I groaned. Wasn't I here ten minutes ago? The red light sent me tearing into my bag and putting on my plugsuit in record time. I beamed with pride when I realized that since I was the only pilot who had not gone home, maybe I would be the only one to tackle it. After all, Wonder Girl and Shinji were useless. I could defeat all the Angels by myself. They certainly must know that.  
我呻吟了一声。我不是十分钟前才在这儿吗？红光让我迅速从包里扯出驾驶服，以破纪录的速度穿上。当我意识到自己是唯一一个没回家的驾驶员时，我不禁自豪地挺起胸膛，也许只有我能应对这次挑战。毕竟，奇迹少女和真嗣都是废物。我一个人就能打败所有使徒。他们肯定也知道这一点。

My first Angel in a foreign country! My debut battle in Japan .  
我在异国的第一个使徒！我在日本的首次战斗。

Then my face fell and I glanced at the stationary Evangelion Unit flying beside my own.  
然后我的脸色沉了下来，瞥了一眼旁边静止不动的福音战士单位，它正与我自己的机体并肩飞行。

"Why do I have to do this with _him?!" I demanded from the cockpit of 02. "I can do it by myself!"_  
“为什么我非得和他一起做这个？！”我从 02 号驾驶舱里质问道，“我自己一个人也能行！”

_

The blond haired woman came over the commlink. Her mouth pinched into a thin line. She looked very stern. This was the same woman who monitored my first synch test here and one of Misato's friends.  
金发女子通过通讯链接传来声音，她的嘴角紧抿成一条细线，看起来非常严肃。她就是在这里监控我第一次同步测试的那位女士，也是美里的一位朋友。

Friend? Misato sure had strange taste in friends. This woman looked like she was perpetually sucking on a lemon.  
朋友？美里对朋友的选择真是奇特。这个女人看起来总像是嘴里含着柠檬似的。

"Calm down Asuka. We're sending you to launch now. It can't be helped."  
冷静点，明日香。我们正送你去发射。这是没办法的事。

I voiced my opinion once again, hoping it would reach the ears of someone else. No one responded, so I gave up. Some people who know me might say that the great Sohryu Asuka Langley never gives up, but then again, no one _knew me. Even I know when I'm outclassed._  
我再次表达了我的看法，希望有人能听到。但无人回应，我只好放弃。认识我的人可能会说，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不放弃，但话说回来，没人真正了解我。就连我自己也知道何时该认输。

_

_I'm never outclassed.  我从未被超越。_

_

Not two seconds later, when I had synchronized with my Eva, I found myself flying over a giant body of water. There was no use arguing with someone like _that. While I could destroy their Geofront in two strokes, I knew better than disregarding superiors. My disdainful attitude didn't faze them one bit._  
不到两秒钟后，当我与我的 Eva 同步时，我发现自己正飞越一片巨大的水域。与那种人争论毫无意义。虽然我只需两击就能摧毁他们的 Geofront，但我知道不应忽视上级。我那轻蔑的态度丝毫没有影响到他们。

_

Damn.

Misato appeared to brief us on this procedure for this Angel. "Therefore, we're going to intercept the target at the water's edge, just before it makes landfall..."  
美里出现，向我们简要介绍了这次对使徒的行动。“因此，我们将在目标登陆前，在水边拦截它……”

I was starting to love water more and more. My first epic battle was in the water, so I naturally felt right at home on it. Any place where I could destroy an angel would be home to me.  
我开始越来越喜欢水了。我的第一场史诗级战斗就是在水中进行的，所以我在水上自然感觉如鱼得水。任何我能摧毁天使的地方对我来说都是家。

"... so 01 and 02 will mount a coordinated attack in a series of waves. In other words, close in and take turns."  
...所以 01 和 02 将发起一系列波浪式的协同攻击。换句话说，就是靠近并轮流进行。

I don't take turns with anyone! I'll do it myself. I remember giving her a halfhearted "Roger" before complaining again. It was to justify leaving Shinji behind in a couple of minutes. "This sucks. My debut battle and they won't even let me handle it alone."  
我不和任何人轮流！我自己来。我记得当时敷衍地回了句“收到”，然后又抱怨起来。这是为了几分钟后把真嗣留在后面找借口。“这太糟糕了。我的首战，他们甚至不让我独自处理。”

"It's just S.O.P. procedures, you know."  
"这只是标准操作程序，你知道的。"

I didn't expect a reply, so when I got one from Shinji, I was annoyed. The smile on his face was mocking me, saying that I can't handle it alone. I snapped back at him to stay out of my way. He looked appropriately scared and immediately shut the commlink. "His selection as pilot must have been a joke."  
我本没指望得到回复，所以当收到真嗣的回信时，我感到恼火。他脸上的笑容像是在嘲笑我，说我一个人应付不来。我厉声让他别挡道。他看起来吓得够呛，立刻关闭了通讯链接。“选他当驾驶员肯定是个玩笑。”

I mean, honestly. It's hard to believe that this boy could mercilessly kill Angels. The only time I had ever fought with him he was in my Unit. And... I did all the work on top of that too! How in the world can this guy be even standing in his Eva?  
我的意思是，说真的。很难相信这个男孩能无情地杀死使徒。唯一一次和他并肩作战，他驾驶的是我的机体。而且……我还得额外承担所有工作！这家伙到底是怎么站在他的 EVA 里的？

_What an idiot.  真是个白痴。_

_

I plummeted to the ground like a comet and landed hard on the ground. Dirt and debris formed a crater around my feet. Shinji landed beside me a split second later. I picked up a spear and waited for the ground crew to give me my external cable. "Two against one isn't what I call a fair fight. It's not even," I declared.  
我如流星般坠落，重重地摔在地上。泥土和碎片在我脚下形成了一个小坑。真嗣紧随其后，几乎同时落地。我捡起一支长矛，等待地勤人员给我接上外部电缆。“二对一可不是我所谓的公平战斗。这不公平，”我宣称。

"Survival takes priority," was Misato's answer. Honor was one of the things NERV in Germany insisted on having. Apparantly, they didn't believe in that here. I found myself wishing to be in Germany again. At least there, they'd let me handle things on my own. At least they had faith in me.  
“生存优先，”美里回答道。荣誉是德国 NERV 坚持要有的东西。显然，这里的人并不相信这些。我不禁怀念起德国来。至少在那里，他们让我自己处理事情。至少他们对我有信心。

Where was that other pilot? Ayanami Rei? I didn't even see her at the base for backup in case Shinji and I failed. Which of course, I wouldn't, but it was always good to have backup. Even if it was overkill.  
那个另一位驾驶员呢？绫波零？我连她在基地作为后备的影子都没见到，以防我和真嗣失败。当然，我不会失败的，但有后备总是好的。即便这有点多余。

She hadn't said one word to me, and before I could try to talk to her, she had already left. Come to think of it, she didn't even say a word when the blond haired woman told her the synch scores. Not even a little reaction. While I grinned proudly and Shinji drew circles on the ground with his foot, she just stood there. Like a statue.  
她一句话也没跟我说，我还没来得及尝试和她交谈，她就已经离开了。想想看，当那个金发女人告诉她同步率分数时，她连一句话都没说。一点反应都没有。我得意地咧嘴笑，真嗣在地上画圈，她只是站在那里。像座雕像。

_Why do they only pick strange people to be Evangelion pilots? And why was I the only one who wasn't strange?  
为什么他们只挑选奇怪的人来当 EVA 驾驶员？而我为什么是唯一一个不奇怪的呢？_

_

A roaring column of water that scraped the belly of the sky alerted me out of my thoughts. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the purple Evangelion flinch. So, Shinji was scared? I snorted and pushed the controls forward. Of course he was scared, he had no spine.  
一道咆哮的水柱擦过天空的腹部，将我从思绪中惊醒。眼角余光中，我看到那台紫色的福音战士微微一颤。所以，真嗣害怕了？我嗤之以鼻，向前推动操纵杆。当然他害怕了，他没有骨气。

"Let me handle this Angel! You just cover my back!" S.O.P procedures be damned. I loved finding loopholes in procedure. Good job NERV, you got two pilots out here handling what is a one pilot job. So I'll handle the job and split half the credit. But everyone will always know that I did it and should get all the glory.  
“让我来对付这个使徒！你只需掩护我！”去他的标准操作程序。我喜欢在程序中找漏洞。NERV 干得不错，让两个驾驶员来处理本该一人完成的工作。那我就接手这份工作，分一半功劳。但所有人都会知道是我完成的，理应独享这份荣耀。

The idiot said that there's no way he'd be my back-up and I stated that ladies should go first. Then I shut off my commlink so he couldn't argue anymore. I hated people who tried to argue with me. He'll learn in time that it is pointless to banter with me. I'll always win.  
那个白痴说绝不会做我的后援，而我则表示女士优先。随后我关闭了通讯链接，让他无法再争辩。我讨厌那些试图与我争论的人。他迟早会明白，与我斗嘴是徒劳的。我总是赢家。

"Charge!" 冲锋！

I heard a strangled gasp from 01 as I hopped from building to building. The steel beams in those structures snapped like toothpicks under my massive feet. It was a pleasurable feeling, it helped me remember that I alone was in command.  
我听到 01 那边传来一声窒息般的喘息，我正从一栋栋建筑间跳跃而过。那些建筑中的钢梁在我巨大的脚下如同牙签般断裂。这种感觉令人愉悦，它帮助我记住，只有我才是指挥者。

With a fierce battle cry, I swung the lance over my head and cut the Angel in two. The two sides split open like that of an overripe melon. There was silence. No doubt they were staring at me in awe. I was pretty impressed myself. "What do you think about _that, Third Child?" He didn't answer. I took in my victory and quoted, "A fight should be clean, elegant, and without waste."_  
随着一声激烈的战斗呐喊，我将长矛在头顶挥舞，将使徒一分为二。两半如同过熟的瓜果般裂开。四周一片寂静。毫无疑问，他们正敬畏地凝视着我。我自己也颇为震撼。“你觉得如何，第三适格者？”他没有回答。我沉浸在胜利中，引用道：“战斗应当干净利落，优雅且不浪费。”

_

He still didn't say anything. Didn't I say that I would handle it? Maybe now the command center wouldn't waste all their energy and expense.  
他依旧一言不发。我不是说过我会处理吗？也许现在指挥中心不会浪费他们所有的精力和资源了。

_Tell the other two pilots they can go home. We have Asuka, and she's all that matters.  
告诉另外两位驾驶员他们可以回家了。我们有明日香，她才是最重要的。_

_

I dreamed briefly of being the only Evangelion pilot when something stirred beside me. I watched in horror as the two split sides became two separate entities.  
我短暂地梦见自己是唯一的 EVA 驾驶员，这时有什么东西在我旁边动了动。我惊恐地看着那分裂的两边变成了两个独立的实体。

"Two angels?" Shinji exclaimed.  
“两个使徒？” 真嗣惊呼道。

I took a couple steps back as Misato's voice echoed in the cockpit. "What the _hell is this crap?!"_  
我后退了几步，美里在驾驶舱中的声音回荡着。“这他妈是什么鬼东西？！”

_

For once, I was speechless. Germany never told me that Angels can divide in two! I fumbled with my spear and dropped it into the sea from shock. "Shit!"  
这一次，我无言以对。德国方面从未告诉我使徒能一分为二！我慌乱地摆弄着长矛，因震惊而失手将其掉入海中。“该死！”

The two Angels moved as one. The gray one quickly advanced towards me while the red one went for 01. I pounded on the sea as if that would reveal the fallen spear, but it did nothing. I staggered back and tried to get a good footing on land.  
两位天使行动如一体。灰色的那位迅速向我逼近，而红色的那位则冲向 01。我猛击海面，仿佛那样能揭示坠落的矛，但什么也没发生。我踉跄后退，试图在陆地上站稳脚跟。

"Shinji! Asuka! What are you doing?!"  
“真嗣！明日香！你们在干什么？！”

Somehow, the Angel had snapped Shinji's gun in half and was mimicking the steady proceed of its twin. While I was watching 01, a building got caught in my feet. I fell over and landed on my back. My spine felt like it was on fire.  
不知怎么的，天使折断了真嗣的枪，并模仿着其双胞胎的稳定推进。当我注视着 01 时，一栋建筑绊住了我的脚。我摔倒了，背部着地。我的脊椎感觉像着了火一样。

"Get out of there, now!"  
“快离开那里，马上！”

I couldn't obey that order from Dogma. I got the feeling that I was being lifted in the air. I thrashed and kicked violently, but to no avail. The Angel was ready to snap me in two. I made one desperate plea for help. "Shinji! I need—"  
我无法服从来自 Dogma 的命令。我感觉自己被举到了空中。我拼命挣扎，猛烈踢打，但无济于事。天使准备将我一分为二。我发出了最后的求救。“真嗣！我需要——”

I felt the support suddenly disappear from underneath me and I crashed down to land again. Underneath me was Unit 01. "Just what the _hell are you doing?" I demanded._  
我感到支撑突然消失，再次坠落着地。我落在初号机上。“你到底在搞什么鬼？”我质问道。

_

The Evangelion didn't move. Oddly enough, neither could I. The last thing I remember before landing in a pile of rocks was a single synchronized kick from two Angels.  
那台 EVA 没有动。奇怪的是，我也动弹不得。坠入乱石堆前，我最后记得的是两位使徒同步一致的踢击。

They were perfectly in unison.  
他们的动作完全同步。

*****

After a disastrous review of our mission and subsequent scolding from the Subcommander, I was seething. That... that boy dared to argue with me! The Third Child left the room, but not before giving me a look that I couldn't read. It wasn't hate, but it wasn't disappointment either.  
在一场灾难性的任务回顾和副司令的严厉斥责之后，我怒火中烧。那个……那个小子竟敢和我争辩！第三适格者离开了房间，但在那之前，他看了我一眼，那眼神我无法解读。既非憎恨，也非失望。

I don't know how long I stayed in that conference room, dressed in only my plugsuit with a towel draped over my shoulders. I felt like a failure. The first person to blame is always Dogma, but I feel that that shouldn't be the case. Maybe it was my sense of honor, but blame should always be on the pilot first.  
我不知道自己在那间会议室里待了多久，只穿着驾驶服，肩上搭着一条毛巾。我感觉自己像个失败者。首先被指责的总是多格玛，但我感觉这不应该是事实。或许是我的荣誉感作祟，但责任首先应该落在驾驶员身上。

_"You are the best at what you do, and if you can't anticipate these things, maybe you should not pilot, Miss Langley."  
“你在你的领域是最棒的，如果连这些都预料不到，或许兰利小姐你就不该驾驶，”_

_

I shook my head and tried to dispel these thoughts. Maybe it was best to keep blame on Dogma. After all, I _was the best at what I did. What could I do if I was given false information by the Japanese? It was their fault, not mine._  
我摇了摇头，试图驱散这些念头。或许把责任归咎于多格玛是最好的选择。毕竟，我在我的领域是最出色的。如果日本人给了我错误的信息，我又能怎么办呢？那是他们的错，不是我的。

_

Kaji left for a little while to God knows where, but I didn't feel like moving. It was odd when I didn't want to follow Kaji. Maybe I thought that my failure would reflect in his eyes. I could wait until this scarred over and then I could talk to him again.  
加治离开了一会儿，天知道去了哪里，但我并不想动。当我不想跟随加治时，感觉很奇怪。也许我认为我的失败会映在他的眼中。我可以等到这道伤疤愈合，然后再和他交谈。

This hurt so much. I failed.  
这太痛苦了。我失败了。

Sure, I had let people down before, but not when it came to piloting my Evangelion. And this marked my first real failure. I felt like shit.  
当然，我以前也曾让人失望过，但不是在驾驶我的 EVA 时。而这标志着我的第一次真正失败。我感觉糟透了。

"Are you still in here moping?"  
“你还在这里郁闷吗？”

I couldn't even smile for him. "Yeah. Moping over what a stupid person the Third is."  
我甚至无法为他露出笑容。“嗯。在郁闷第三是个多么愚蠢的人。”

Kaji sat down beside me. "Ouch. You shouldn't be so harsh on him."  
加持坐在我旁边。“哎呀，你不该对他这么苛刻。”

Indignant, I crossed my arms. "It's his fault I couldn't do it. He was distracting me the whole time!" I saw the sly look that Kaji gave me. "Not like that!" I snapped. "I was afraid that if I did something, he'd get hurt. So I didn't go all out on that Angel."  
"我气愤地交叉双臂。“都是他的错，我没法专心。他一直在分散我的注意力！”我瞥见了加持那狡黠的眼神。“不是你想的那样！”我急忙辩解，“我是担心如果我全力以赴，他会受伤。所以我才没有对那个使徒使出全力。”

The man scratched his chin. "It's all right, Asuka. No one expects you to be perfect on the first try."  
"男人挠了挠下巴。“没关系，明日香。没人指望你第一次尝试就完美无缺。”

I jumped to my feet and angrily pointed at myself. "_I expect me to be perfect! How can you say such a thing, Kaji? And this isn't about me, it's about Shinji!"_  
"我猛地站起身，愤怒地指向自己。“我期望自己完美！你怎么能这么说，加持？而且这不仅仅是关于我，是关于真嗣的！”

_

"Shh... enough Asuka. No more talk of this. Pretty girls shouldn't fume." I quieted myself and sat down dejectedly. "I came back to tell you that they denied my request to have you live with me for the moment." I was back on my feet in an instant, but Kaji's hand was holding my arm. "You'll be living with Misato for the time being..."  
“嘘...够了，明日香。别再提这事了。漂亮女孩不该生气。”我沮丧地坐下，安静下来。“我回来是想告诉你，他们拒绝了让我暂时和你同住的请求。”我立刻站了起来，但加持的手抓住了我的手臂。“你暂时要和美里住在一起...”

*****

And that's how it all started. After Misato dropped the announcement of our "synch training" on us, I think I just stood there dumbfounded. A hard day's work of hauling up my belongings (which Kaji did), and I was rewarded with _this._  
就这样，一切开始了。美里宣布我们进行“同步训练”后，我想我当时只是呆若木鸡地站在那里。辛苦了一天搬运行李（是加持帮忙的），结果却换来这个。

_

This was just the beginning, and I got a sinking feeling that I was far away from the end. Once I found out that the training couldn't be avoided, I braced myself for the longest four days of my life. I hated beer, but if it could make all this go away as it was purported to, I'd down three whole cans.  
这只是个开始，我有一种预感，离结束还远得很。得知训练无法避免后，我做好了迎接生命中最漫长的四天的准备。我讨厌啤酒，但如果它能像传闻中那样让这一切消失，我愿意一口气喝下三整罐。

Author's notes: This chapter moved too slowly for my taste, but I need to put in the background before I go on. I don't believe the personality Asuka shows us is her true self, but maybe that's just me. *smiles* Hope to see you the next chapter, and do leave feedback while you're here.  
作者的话：这一章对我来说进展太慢了，但我需要在继续之前铺垫背景。我不认为我们看到的明日香的性格是她真实的自我，但或许这只是我的看法。*微笑* 期待下一章与你相见，别忘了留下你的反馈。

### Chapter 2

"Here, put this on right now."  
“来，现在就穿上这个。”

I tried to look as menacing as I could, but one of my age and height against someone of Misato's age and height... I hoped I didn't look the part of a cornered animal, because I sure felt like it. "No! I'm not like Shinji! You can't just order me around like you can with him!"  
我尽力摆出一副凶狠的样子，但以我的年龄和身高去对抗美里那样的年龄和身高……我希望自己看起来不像一只走投无路的动物，因为我确实有那种感觉。“不！我和真嗣不一样！你不能像对他那样随意命令我！”

Shinji stared at me. He was already wearing the ludicrous "synch outfit", a clashing ensemble of black spandex shorts and a loose fitting top that threatened to fall off the shoulders. It was a sad excuse for a woman's blouse. Maybe something she picked up at a thrift store? The black music notes trailing up the front made me think of a marching band gone berserk.  
真嗣盯着我看。他已经穿上了那套滑稽的“同步装”，一套黑色紧身短裤和一件松松垮垮的上衣，肩膀处似乎随时会滑落。这简直是对女性衬衫的悲哀模仿。或许是她在二手店淘来的？前襟上黑色音符的图案让我想起了失控的行进乐队。

And that spineless jerk didn't even hesitate to put it on! Hell, he hesitated when I gave him my _plugsuit, which I think has a lot more class than _this! But no, just a simple nod of the head and a couple of minutes later he was dressed. With no embarrassment evident in his face.__  
那个没骨气的混蛋居然毫不犹豫地就穿上了！见鬼，我给他我的驾驶服时他还犹豫了一下，我觉得那可比这件有品位多了！但没用，他只是简单地点了点头，几分钟后就穿好了。脸上丝毫没有尴尬的表情。

__

_There's nothing worse than a housebroken male.  
没有什么比一个驯服的男人更糟糕的了。_

"Are you going to put this on willingly, or am I going to have Shinji put it on you _for_ you?"  
“你是自愿穿上这个，还是我让真嗣帮你穿上？”

I recoiled and gave her the most hateful look I could muster. Shinji even got to his feet and was glaring at her. "N-Now Misato, you can't mean such things!" I snapped my attention to him and noticed that a bright red flush was staining his cheeks and nose. When he saw the look on my face, he shrank back. I knew he was a pervert. I knew it.  
我退缩了一下，尽可能地向她投去最憎恨的目光。甚至连真嗣都站了起来，怒视着她。“不，美里，你不能说这种话！”我猛地转向他，注意到他的脸颊和鼻子都染上了鲜红的潮红。当他看到我的表情时，他退缩了。我知道他是个变态。我早就知道了。

"So what's it going to be, Asuka?"  
“那么，明日香，你打算怎么办？”

"You know, this has to be some form of child abuse," I insisted. "Wait until everyone at the headquarters hears about this. You'll be demoted for sure."  
“你知道，这肯定是某种形式的虐待儿童，”我坚持道，“等着吧，总部的人听到这件事后，你肯定会被降职的。”

Misato had a confident smile on her face. "It was approved by Commander Ikari himself."  
美里脸上带着自信的微笑。“这是碇司令亲自批准的。”

"Father did?" Shinji stepped beside me, and I could feel his arm brush against mine. I yanked my arm away and shoved him farther away from me. No one touches me.  
“父亲同意了？”真嗣走到我旁边，我能感觉到他的手臂擦过我的。我猛地抽回手臂，把他推得更远。没人能碰我。

"Yes. Just give it up Asuka. You'll make these next four days unbearable if you act like this."  
“是的。放弃吧，明日香。如果你这样表现，接下来的四天会变得难以忍受。”

_If I was going down, I was taking everyone with me.  
如果我要倒下，我会拉上所有人陪葬。_

_

I glanced at the clock. We had been arguing for almost half an hour on this subject alone. In total, Misato took what seemed like hours to tell us of the plan. The time was now 2:27. In the morning.  
我瞥了一眼时钟。光是这个话题，我们就争论了近半个小时。总的来说，Misato 花了似乎好几个小时才把计划告诉我们。现在时间是凌晨 2 点 27 分。

_Why aren't you getting tired, damn you?  
你怎么还不累，该死的？_

_

I thought I could wear her down. I thought she'd be finished with my mouth after the first hour. Apparently, she could go on for longer than I could. I was wearing myself down. I growled and snatched the outfit out of Misato's outstretched hand. She was smirking in triumph. I said, "I'll be damned if that pervert gets within an inch of touching me. I'll put this on myself, thank you."  
我以为我能让她妥协。我以为她会在第一个小时后对我的嘴失去兴趣。显然，她能坚持的时间比我长。我正在让自己疲惫不堪。我咆哮着，从美里伸出的手中夺过衣服。她正得意地笑着。我说：“如果那个变态能碰到我一寸，我就自己穿上，谢谢你。”

Said pervert let out a huge sigh. He was probably thinking the same thing I was. Time to go to sleep. Shinji shuffled off to his room and closed the door. Misato strolled over and flung the door wide open. He hadn't even gotten to his bed and was standing with his back to the door. "No, it has to stay open."  
那个变态发出了一声长叹。他可能也在想同样的事情。该去睡觉了。真嗣拖着脚步回到自己的房间，关上了门。美里悠闲地走过去，猛地推开门。他甚至还没走到床边，就背对着门站着。“不，门必须开着。”

"But it doesn't start until tomorrow!" Shinji took a step forward. "I can keep it closed until I wake up tomorrow."  
“但明天才开始！”真嗣向前迈了一步。“我可以关上门，直到明天醒来。”

_Well, he has a little bit of a spine. But not much.  
嗯，他还有那么一点点骨气。但不多。_

_

"Ah..." Misato tapped a finger to her forehead. "But I'm leaving you two to yourselves now. And... tomorrow was yesterday. It's tomorrow right now."  
“啊...” 美里用手指轻敲额头。“不过我现在要把你们俩单独留在这里了。而且...昨天就是明天。现在已经是明天了。”

Shinji blinked, and I felt like knocking myself out. According to the plan, Misato would only come to this apartment during our "twister test". NERV rented the apartment next door and Misato would always be there. "Well then, I'll leave you two to yourselves." She flashed me a thumbs up and slid the door to the hallway open. "Don't do anything I wouldn't approve of during the night, okay?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，我感觉自己快要晕倒了。根据计划，美里只会在我们的“龙卷风测试”期间来这个公寓。NERV 租下了隔壁的公寓，美里通常会在那里。“那么，我就把你们俩留在这里了。”她朝我竖起大拇指，拉开通往走廊的门。“晚上别做任何我不会批准的事，好吗？”

I scowled at her. "In _his dreams."_  
我瞪了她一眼。“在他的梦里。”

_

"Tomorrow then. Bright and early at 7:00 ."  
“那就明天。一大早，7 点。”

"Fine." “好吧。”

"Don't forget, cameras are installed all over this place. I'll know when you aren't following my commands."  
"别忘了，这个地方到处都装了摄像头。你不听我的命令，我马上就会知道。"

When the door clicked shut, it dawned on me. This was _true isolation. Somehow she had managed to bolt the door so it couldn't be opened from the inside. She was a harsh taskmaster and had anticipated all my moves. No going anywhere inside without the other, no going outside period. We were connected at the hip, everywhere. She even suggested to harbor a feeling of togetherness that we take baths together._  
当门咔嗒一声关上时，我恍然大悟。这是真正的隔离。不知怎么的，她设法从外面把门闩上了，从里面打不开。她是个严厉的监工，预料到了我所有的行动。不能单独待在屋里，更别提出去。我们形影不离，无处不在。她甚至建议为了培养一种团结感，我们可以一起洗澡。

_

Shinji's eyes were about to pop out of their sockets.  
真嗣的眼睛几乎要瞪出眼眶了。

No way. 不可能。

She suggested that we didn't have to be in the _shower together, we just had to be present in the bathroom when the other way taking a shower._  
她提议我们不必一起洗澡，只需要在对方洗澡时待在浴室里。

_

Not good enough, Misato.  
还不够好，美里。

Then as her final statement on baths, she said the door must be open to the bathroom and the person standing outside. I reluctantly agreed to this. I had gained so much ground that I didn't want to risk losing it.  
然后，关于洗澡的最后一点，她说浴室的门必须开着，外面还得有人站着。我勉强同意了这一点。我已经取得了这么多进展，不想冒险失去它。

"So what do we do now?" I asked rhetorically.  
“那我们现在怎么办？”我自问自答。

Shinji stood in the doorway with his arms crossed. "You put on that... that _thing, and then we go to sleep." We stood there and looked at each other for a moment. I don't think we both believed the situation we were in. I felt so lost._  
真嗣站在门口，双臂交叉。“你穿上那件……那东西，然后我们就睡觉。”我们站在那里，互相看着对方。我想我们俩都不太相信自己所处的状况。我感到如此迷茫。

_

"Stop staring at me like that, it makes me uncomfortable." He averted his eyes to the ground and headed towards his bed. Though I would never admit it aloud, I was partially saying that to myself.  
"别那样盯着我看，让我很不舒服。" 他移开目光，朝自己的床走去。虽然我永远不会大声承认，但那话部分也是对自己说的。

The lights clicked off by some unseen force until only the bathroom's was on.  
灯光被某种无形的力量一一点灭，只剩下浴室的灯还亮着。

"Hey, where am I supposed to sleep?"  
"嘿，我该睡哪儿？"

A muffled voice from the other room answered me. "Misato didn't say. But I'm guessing in my room."  
从另一个房间传来一个闷闷的声音回答我。“美里没说。但我猜是在我房间。”

I laughed at him. "Yeah right, you just can't wait to have me sleeping beside you."  
我笑着对他说。“是啊，你肯定是迫不及待想让我睡在你旁边。”

"I have a blanket in here."  
“我这里有一条毯子。”

He seemed unaffected by my flirtatious remark. In fact, he just seemed tired. This angered me for some unexplained reason. I think it was because I knew that no man had ever resisted my charm. Except maybe Kaji, but I swore he would fall one day. "I don't need your damn sympathy. I'm sleeping on the couch until Misato says otherwise. Got it?"  
他对我的调情似乎无动于衷。事实上，他看起来只是很疲惫。不知为何，这让我感到愤怒。我想是因为我知道，从没有人能抵挡住我的魅力。除了可能的加持，但我发誓他总有一天会沦陷。“我不需要你的该死同情。在美里说可以之前，我睡沙发。明白了吗？”

"Fine." “好吧。”

"Fine!" “好吧！”

*****

My backbone felt a little better since yesterday's escape with the Angel, but I noted that the pain transferred itself to my neck. It was throbbing as if it was hit with a sledgehammer. I wished I had unpacked my pillow before conking out. I woke up on the couch, right fist still clenching that outfit. I stumbled over to the bathroom and felt my arms up and down. I was freezing.  
自从昨天与天使逃脱后，我的脊梁感觉好了一点，但我注意到疼痛转移到了我的脖子上。它像被大锤击中一样跳痛。我真希望在昏倒前已经解开了我的枕头。我在沙发上醒来，右手仍然紧握着那套衣服。我踉跄着走到浴室，上下摸索我的手臂。我冷得要命。

Actually, I had already known that I was freezing myself. I woke up numerous times during the night and rubbed my legs together for a little bit of warmth. I had to tuck my feet into the cushions and use my hair as a makeshift blanket to cover my arms.  
实际上，我已经知道自己冻得够呛。夜里我多次醒来，搓揉双腿以获取些许温暖。我不得不把脚塞进垫子里，用头发作为临时毯子盖住我的手臂。

_Now I know why my neck hurts.  
现在我知道为什么我的脖子疼了。_

_

I was mad. Why didn't that idiot put a blanket on me when he knew I was solidifying into a block of ice? I immaturely stomped my foot on the bathroom floor in an effort to keep the black spandex from riding up. Maybe it'll have the added bonus of waking him up from his _warm and cuddly sleep. Or maybe the neighbors below us._  
我气疯了。那白痴明明知道我快冻成冰块了，为什么不给我盖条毯子？我幼稚地在浴室地板上跺脚，试图阻止黑色紧身裤往上缩。也许这还能顺便把他从温暖舒适的睡梦中吵醒。或者把我们楼下的邻居也吵醒。

_

There was a knock on the door. "Are you in there, Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
有人敲门。“你在里面吗，明日香？”真嗣问道。

"Who else would be in here?" I asked dryly as I shoved the blouse over my head. Did that boy have no sense along with no backbone?  
“还能有谁在里面？”我冷冷地回答，一边把衬衫套过头。那小子难道既没脑子也没骨气吗？

"Are you finished?" I didn't have time to answer to this new voice, because the door whipped open and revealed a too happy Misato and Shinji. She was holding him up by a fistful of fabric, and his hands were over his eyes. "Sleep well?" she asked innocently.  
"你完事了吗？" 我还没来得及回应这个新声音，门就猛地被打开，露出一个过于开心的美里和真嗣。她正抓着一把布料把他提起来，他的双手捂在眼睛上。"睡得好吗？"她无辜地问道。

I exploded. I wasn't really mad at Misato, just the fact that she brought someone to watch what could have been a free show. And Sohryu Asuka Langley doesn't give anything for free. "I could have been naked in here! And look, dragging in a _boy to watch!"_  
我爆发了。我并不是真的生美里的气，只是她带人来观看本可以免费的好戏这一事实让我不爽。而且，惣流·明日香·兰格雷可不会免费提供任何东西。"我可能在这里一丝不挂！看看，还拖个男孩来围观！"

_

"But I'm not watching!" He didn't remove his hands from his eyes. I found that amusing. For being so perverted, Ikari Shinji was also virginal.  
"但我没在看！" 他没有把手从眼睛上移开。我觉得这挺好笑的。作为一个如此好色的人，碇真嗣竟然还是个处男。

This calmed me down quite a bit. I must have been staring too long at Shinji because Misato tapped her foot and looked at me haughtily. She didn't have to put into words what she was saying with her eyes.  
这让我平静了不少。我一定是盯着真嗣看了太久，因为美里用脚尖敲着地面，傲慢地看着我。她不需要用言语表达，她的眼神已经说明了一切。

Katsuragi Misato is a bigger pervert than Ikari Shinji.  
葛城美里比碇真嗣还要变态。

God save me. 上帝救救我。

*****

Breakfast consisted of two eggs over easy, three slices of bacon, and a hash brown. Shinji said he didn't like bacon. Too much grease. I said I hated hash browns. Too little grease. We both had to eat everything on our plate. I drew the line when Misato said we had to feed each other from our chopsticks. "We're not babies!" we declared in unison.  
早餐包括两个半熟的煎蛋、三片培根和一个薯饼。真嗣说他不喜欢培根，太油腻了。我说我讨厌薯饼，油太少了。我们俩都得把盘子里的东西吃完。当美里说我们要用筷子互相喂食时，我坚决拒绝了。“我们不是婴儿！”我们异口同声地抗议道。

Misato smiled. 美里笑了。

After making us wash the dishes together (three of them broke, mainly because I threw them on the ground), Shinji said he had to go to the bathroom. Misato smiled again and made me stand outside the open bathroom door. I stood with my hands over my ears and my eyes screwed shut.  
在我们一起洗碗之后（有三只碗破了，主要是因为我把它扔到了地上），真嗣说他得去洗手间。美里又笑了，让我站在敞开的浴室门口。我双手捂住耳朵，眼睛紧闭。

Now, let me get one thing perfectly clear: I'm not uncomfortable with sex. After being in college, I found that it can get you where you want to go. A formfitting top one day can turn the heads of all the guys, even if you are feeling like shit. And my thirteen-year-old head burst with all the compliments from the men. They said I looked beautiful. They said I was so grown-up.  
现在，让我把一件事说清楚：我对性并不感到不适。上了大学后，我发现它可以带你去你想去的地方。某天一件紧身上衣就能让所有男生回头，哪怕你感觉糟透了。而我那十三岁的小脑袋被男人们的赞美塞得满满的。他们说我看起来很美。他们说我长大了。

_

Someone tapped my shoulder. "He's finished. You can stop acting now."  
有人拍了拍我的肩膀。“他结束了。你可以停止表演了。”

"What?!" I poked Misato on her stomach. "Are you _implying that I was watching or hearing any of that?"_  
“什么？！”我戳了戳美里的小腹。“你是说我刚才在看或者听那些吗？”

_

"I wasn't _implying anything."_  
“我并没有暗示什么。”

_

Shinji looked embarrassed. This was probably harder for him than it was for me. I suddenly felt myself feeling sorry for the poor boy, but _that quickly vanished. He was the cause of all this in the first place. Maybe I could hold it in for four days..._  
真嗣看起来很尴尬。这对他来说可能比对我更难。我突然觉得自己在为这个可怜的男孩感到难过，但这种感觉很快就消失了。毕竟，这一切的始作俑者就是他。也许我可以忍耐四天……

_

"What do we do now, Misato?"  
“我们现在该怎么办，美里？”

"Yeah, great almighty leader. What is your all knowing judgment?"  
"是啊，伟大的领袖。你那无所不知的判断是什么？"

Misato actually seemed to contemplate this and put her fingers underneath her chin. When she didn't say anything, I looked over at Shinji. She was up to no good, I knew it. "Before I leave, I want you two to hold hands."  
美里似乎真的在思考这个问题，手指抵在下巴上。她没说话，我转头看向真嗣。她肯定没安好心，我早知道了。“在我离开之前，我要你们两个牵手。”

"What did you say?"  
"你说什么？"

"What the hell!?" "搞什么鬼！？"

She clapped her hands together. "Just kidding."  
她拍了拍手。“开个玩笑。”

"Misato..." I growled. "That's not funny."  
“美里……”我低吼道，“这一点也不好笑。”

Shinji thought it was a little humorous because a smile crept over his face. Once I glared at him though, that smile shot back down to hell where it came from. Only the Devil himself could find that amusing. "Watch it, Third Child. You're treading on dangerous ground here." I leaned in close to him and found it funny how his face was drenched in flame. "The bathroom door is always open, and I know where the knives are kept."  
真嗣觉得这有点滑稽，因为他脸上露出了微笑。但当我瞪了他一眼后，那笑容立刻消失得无影无踪。只有魔鬼自己才会觉得那有趣。“小心点，第三适格者。你正踩在危险地带。”我凑近他，觉得他脸上火辣辣的表情很有趣。“浴室门总是开着的，而且我知道刀子放在哪里。”

My purple haired guardian shook her head. "You've only been in the same house nine hours and you're already making threats of dismemberment?"  
我的紫发守护者摇了摇头。“你才进这个家九个小时，就已经开始威胁要肢解人了？”

"M-M-Misato?" “美-美-美里？”

"Hn?"

Shinji gulped. I didn't move from my position inches from his face. "D-Don't leave me here."  
真嗣咽了口唾沫。我没有从离他脸只有几英寸的位置上移开。“别-别把我留在这儿。”

"Oh, and why don't you want to be alone with me?" I lowered my voice to a sultry purr. I call it my sexy voice. Once the sexy voice turns on, so do the men. The boy looked ready to faint. I would stop this kind of teasing, but with him it was just too much fun. A part of me vowed that I would teach him how to stand up for himself and have some self-confidence before four days were up.  
"哦，你为什么不想单独和我在一起呢？" 我压低声音，带着诱惑的低沉。我称之为我的性感嗓音。一旦性感嗓音启动，男人们也随之心动。那男孩看起来快要晕倒了。我本该停止这种戏弄，但对他来说，这实在太有趣了。我暗自发誓，在四天内，我会教会他如何为自己挺身而出，拥有一些自信。

"I-I—" "我-我——"

I shoved him away in annoyance and he landed in Misato's arms. "Geez stupid, when are you going to grow a spine already?"  
我恼怒地将他推开，他跌入了美里子的怀抱。"真是的，笨蛋，你什么时候才能硬气一点？"

He glared at me and pushed away from Misato. "I do have a spine. I'm not the one throwing herself all over me."  
他瞪了我一眼，从美里身边推开。“我当然有骨气。我不是那个在我身上蹭来蹭去的人。”

"And what's that supposed to mean?!" I noticed that Misato was already in the kitchen, quietly sipping a cup of coffee. How did she get there so quickly? Shinji said nothing. Instead, he put his hands down to his sides and stared at the ground. "Huh? Answer me, Third Child!"  
“那是什么意思？！”我注意到美里已经在厨房里，静静地啜饮着一杯咖啡。她怎么这么快就到了那里？真嗣一言不发。相反，他把手放在身体两侧，盯着地面。“嗯？回答我，第三适格者！”

I'll have him know that I wasn't throwing myself all over anyone. Maybe Kaji, but that's because I liked him a lot. He was grown up, and he had a brain. _And_ a spine. That was child's play, that voice I used on him. At least I wasn't feeling him up as I've been known to do to others in the past.  
我要让他知道，我并没有对任何人投怀送抱。也许对加持先生会这样，但那是因为我非常喜欢他。他成熟，有头脑，还有骨气。我用在他身上的那种声音，不过是小孩子的把戏。至少我没有像过去对其他人那样对他动手动脚。

"Let's just drop it, all right?"  
“我们就此打住，好吗？”

It sounded like an apology to me. I huffed and tried to burn a hole in his head with my eyes. "Fine. This'll all be over in four days, let's at least try to keep a bit of sanity."  
这话听起来像是在道歉。我哼了一声，试图用眼神在他脑袋上烧个洞。“好吧。四天后这一切就结束了，我们至少得尽量保持一点理智。”

He raised his eyes from the ground. "Fine."  
他抬起眼睛，不再看地面。“好吧。”

Yet again, another long staring contest. This time, it was even longer than the first. I snapped at him that if he stared at me, he could make it a little less obvious. In a surprise show of vertebrae, he snapped back that at least he was staring at what was above my shoulders, not between them.  
又一次，漫长的对视比赛。这次，甚至比第一次还要久。我冲他嚷道，如果他非要盯着我看，至少可以不那么明显。出乎意料地，他反唇相讥，说他至少是在看我肩膀以上的部分，而不是中间。

I screamed that he was perverted when he walked out of the room.  
他走出房间时，我尖叫着骂他变态。

For the rest of the day, she worked us like dogs. After the apartment was sparkling form top to bottom, Shinji and I were beat. No matter if it was a one person job like sweeping the floor, Misato always found a way to make it a two person job. For example, while I worked the broom, Shinji would control the dustpan. Or when we did laundry, Shinji would scrub and I would wring the clothes.  
那天剩下的时间里，她把我们使唤得像狗一样。公寓从上到下都闪闪发亮后，我和真嗣累得半死。无论是像扫地这样的单人任务，美里总有办法让它变成双人任务。比如，我扫地时，真嗣就负责拿簸箕。或者洗衣服时，真嗣搓洗，我拧干。

But that wasn't the worst of it. When it came time to make lunch, I did the cooking while Shinji brought me the ingredients. We argued for fifteen minutes on what to make for lunch. Finally, we decided to get it delivered. It took fifteen minutes to decide which restaurant to buy food from. When we did decide, I dialed the phone while we both talked in synchronization to the befuddled telephone boy.  
但那还不是最糟糕的。到了做午饭的时候，我负责烹饪，而真嗣给我递食材。我们争论了十五分钟该做什么午餐。最终，我们决定叫外卖。又花了十五分钟才决定从哪家餐厅订餐。当我们终于决定后，我拨打电话，我们俩同步地向困惑的接线员点餐。

"How does this thing work, anyways?" Misato handed me a small black box that looked like a tape cassette player. She gave Shinji one too. The two were connected by a wire about five feet in length. "Do you play tapes in it?"  
“这玩意儿到底怎么用的？”美里递给我一个看起来像磁带播放器的小黑盒子。她也给了真嗣一个。两个盒子之间通过一根约五英尺长的电线相连。“是要用它来播放磁带吗？”

"It's an SDAT player with a slight modification. You are to wear it all the time unless I tell you otherwise."  
"这是一个经过轻微改装的 SDAT 播放器。除非我另有指示，否则你必须一直戴着它。"

Shinji put the headphones on his ears. I did the same. "It doesn't feel any different from my old player."  
真嗣将耳机戴在耳朵上。我也照做了。“感觉和我以前的播放器没什么不同。”

"Turn on the switch on the left side."  
"打开左侧的开关。"

We both did the same, and then I heard a high-pitched ringing in my ears. I flinched. So did Shinji.  
我们俩都做了同样的事，然后我听到耳朵里一阵尖锐的铃声。我缩了一下。真嗣也是。

"What is this, Misato?" we both asked. We were perfectly in unison. I was so caught off guard that I just stared at Shinji and scratched my head. He was staring back and scratching his head at the same time as well. "Misato!" We exclaimed. "What is this doing to us?!"  
“这是什么，美里？”我们异口同声地问。我们完全同步了。我太措手不及了，只是盯着真嗣，挠了挠头。他也在回望着我，同时挠着头。“美里！”我们喊道，“这到底对我们做了什么？！”

I moved my right hand, he moved his left hand. He shook his head to the right, I shook mine to the left. I took a step forward, and so did he. I couldn't believe it; he was mimicking my every move. Well, you couldn't call it mimicking if it was done at exactly the same moment. I couldn't tell who was mimicking who.  
我动了右手，他动了左手。他向右摇头，我向左摇头。我向前迈了一步，他也一样。我简直不敢相信；他在模仿我的每一个动作。好吧，如果是在完全相同的时刻做的，就不能称之为模仿。我分不清是谁在模仿谁。

Misato explained. "There's a special chip inside that monitors brain waves in... uh... that area of your brain that controls speech and motor movements."  
美里解释道：“里面有一个特殊的芯片，可以监测大脑中控制言语和运动功能的区域……呃……也就是你们大脑中负责这些的部分。”

"You mean the cerebrum and temporal lobe?" we both asked. I looked at Shinji, was that his thought or mine?  
“你是说大脑皮层和颞叶吗？”我们俩同时问道。我看向真嗣，这是他的想法还是我的？

Misato laughed uneasily. "I wasn't really paying attention when Ritsuko explained it to me, but it monitors the brain waves. Half of what you do and half of what you do merge together so you two will act as one." She must have seen the skeptical look on my face. "Or something like that."  
美里不安地笑了笑。“里子给我解释的时候我没太认真听，但总之它能监测脑电波。你们俩的行为和动作会融合在一起，就像一个人一样。”她肯定看到了我脸上的怀疑表情。“或者类似那样吧。”

"You mean to tell me you can read my thoughts?" I demanded of Shinji. He asked me the same thing at the same time, only a lot quieter.  
"你是说你能读懂我的心思？" 我质问真嗣。他几乎同时问我同样的问题，只是声音小得多。

Misato stepped in. "No, it can't read thoughts. It only obeys impulses from both of you. Once a happy medium is reached, then you two will act on it."  
美里插话道："不，它不能读心。它只服从你们双方的冲动。一旦找到平衡点，你们俩就会据此行动。

"How?" “怎么？”

She shrugged. "She said it had something to do with the oscillations on the brain waves. Each movement has its own unique vibration. I'm guessing it travels through the wire and into your ears. The brain picks up on the vibration and acts accordingly."  
她耸耸肩。"她说这与脑电波的振荡有关。每个动作都有其独特的振动。我猜它是通过电线传到你们耳朵里的。大脑捕捉到这种振动并做出相应的反应。

I took off my headphones. Shinji did the same. This was starting to make sense to me. Was NERV really this advanced to be doing this? And why? What in the world would they have use for something like this? "So, if I willingly punch myself in the stomach, would he punch himself?" I might actually enjoy this.  
我摘下了耳机。真嗣也照做了。我开始觉得这有点道理了。NERV 真的已经先进到这种地步了吗？又是为了什么？他们究竟要用这种东西做什么？“所以，如果我自愿打自己的肚子，他会打自己吗？”我可能会觉得挺有趣的。

"I don't know." “我不知道。”

Shinji shifted from foot to foot. "When are we supposed to wear this?"  
真嗣来回挪动着脚步。“我们什么时候该戴上这个？”

"You wear it when you're not sleeping, taking a shower, or if you don't want to talk to the other person." Misato's eyes went all soft, and I couldn't figure out why. "If you wish to speak to each other and actually hold a conversation, then feel free to take them off. Synchronization stems from understanding the person standing right next to you. Talking to each other is better for harmony than using this chip."  
“你不睡觉、不洗澡，或者不想和对方说话的时候，就戴上它。”美里眼神变得柔和，我不明白为什么。“如果你想和对方交流，真正进行对话，那就随时可以摘下来。同步源于对身边人的理解。互相交谈比使用这个芯片更有利于和谐。”

I stuck my tongue out at her and put my headphones on. At least I wouldn't have to talk to him. "This thing can be beaten, I know it."  
我朝她吐了吐舌头，戴上耳机。至少我不必和他交谈。“我知道这事儿能解决，我确信。”

When Misato left, she told us that she would return near sundown to see if we had synchronized. She told us to practice our twister test and said it didn't have to be perfect, to which I wryly added that it probably wouldn't be. Well, at least I'd be perfect, but Shinji would be another story.  
美里离开时，告诉我们她会在日落时分回来检查我们是否同步。她让我们练习扭曲测试，并说不需要完美，我则苦笑着补充说，大概也不会太完美。好吧，至少我会是完美的，但真嗣就另当别论了。

He didn't say anything.  
他什么也没说。

"And remember, I'm watching your every move," she said cryptically. I think we both shuddered. The door clicked yet again, and we found ourselves alone. Another uncomfortable silence.  
"记住，我正盯着你的一举一动，"她神秘地说道。我想我们都打了个寒颤。门再次咔嗒一声，我们发现自己孤零零的。又是一阵令人不安的沉默。

"What do we do now?" Sundown wasn't for another hour or so, what in the world could we do in the meantime?  
"现在我们该怎么办？"离日落还有一个小时左右，在这段时间里我们能做什么呢？

The modified SDAT player clipped onto our spandex shorts and kept it out of our way, except for that cord that ran between us. He put the headphones on his ears and shrugged. "I guess all we can do is practice." I felt insulted. I didn't know whether he was putting those headphones on his ears because we had to or because he didn't want to hear me talk.  
改装过的 SDAT 播放器夹在我们的紧身短裤上，避免了妨碍，除了那根连接我们的线。他把耳机戴在耳朵上，耸了耸肩。"我想我们只能练习了。"我感到被冒犯了。我不知道他是出于必须还是不想听我说话才戴上耳机的。

"Now don't be reading my thoughts, you pervert."  
"别偷看我的想法，你这个变态。"

"I'm not a pervert. Stop calling me such names."  
"我不是变态。别再这么叫我。"

"Whatever." I grudgingly put mine on too and flipped the switch. Suddenly, I saw my mannerisms in his body and felt his in mine. I felt foreign to myself. It was certainly a strange feeling.  
"随你怎么说。" 我不情愿地也戴上它，并拨动了开关。突然间，我看到了自己在他身体里的举止，感受到了他的在我身上。我对自己感到陌生。这确实是一种奇怪的感觉。

The aptly named "twister test" didn't require much thought. From what it looked like, all you had to do was put your hands down on the lighted circle. Misato named it the "twister test" off an old game that she used to play called (surprisingly) Twister. The only reason I had heard of it before was that I played it briefly in America.  
这个恰如其名地被称为“旋风测试”的环节并不需要太多思考。看起来，你只需将双手放在发光的圆圈上即可。Misato 之所以称之为“旋风测试”，是因为她曾经玩过一款叫做（出乎意料地）Twister 的老游戏。我之前听说过这款游戏，只是因为在美国的短暂时光里玩过一会儿。

When I stepped onto the mat, Shinji did the same on the other side. Once the mat sensed added weight, various circles started blinking. Shinji got to his knees and started pressing the circles. I did the same, but it wasn't anything close to what Shinji was doing. No matter what circles I pressed, it felt like I was doing something wrong.  
当我踏上垫子时，Shinji 也在另一边做了同样的动作。一旦垫子感应到增加的重量，各种圆圈开始闪烁。Shinji 跪下并开始按下圆圈。我也照做，但与 Shinji 所做的相比，简直是天壤之别。无论我按下哪个圆圈，总感觉自己哪里做错了。

"What the hell is the matter with this thing?"  
“这玩意儿到底怎么回事？”

Once those words flew out, I knew they had also flown out of Shinji's mouth. He had his hand over his face, as if he couldn't believe the vulgarity.  
话一出口，我就知道这些话也同时从真嗣嘴里飞了出来。他用手捂着脸，仿佛无法相信自己竟说出了如此粗俗的话。

"Have you got yours turned on?" we asked each other.  
“你开了吗？”我们互相询问。

"Of course I do!" I nearly screamed it. "I think this stupid thing's broken."  
“当然开了！”我几乎尖叫起来，“我觉得这破玩意儿坏了。”

Shinji didn't say anything.  
真嗣没有说话。

_What's going on?  发生什么事了？_

_

"Here, let me take a look at it."  
“来，让我看看。”

My heart must have stopped beating when he walked over to me. I didn't move. I couldn't even think. I saw my hand move towards his SDAT player while his moved for mine. Before I knew it, both our right hands were on each other's waists, fingers flipping the switches up and down.  
当他向我走来时，我的心一定停止了跳动。我一动不动，甚至无法思考。我看到我的手朝他的 SDAT 播放器移动，而他的手则伸向我的。不知不觉间，我们俩的右手都搭在了对方的腰上，手指上下拨动着开关。

Yes, I know. It shouldn't have been tense, but it was. Painfully so. I did the only thing I was taught to do in uncomfortable situations and push the offender away.  
是的，我知道。本不该紧张的，但却紧张了。痛苦地紧张着。在不舒服的情况下，我唯一学到的事情就是推开冒犯者。

"Get your hands off me." I said deliberately. I pushed his chest forcefully and he staggered back. The thing _must_ be broken, because if it really does what it says it does, then he would have pushed me back. Instead, he just looked at me with a mixture of betrayal and confusion on his face.  
“把手从我身上拿开。”我故意说道。我用力推了他的胸口，他踉跄后退。那东西肯定坏了，因为如果它真的如其所说，那么他应该会把我推回来。然而，他只是带着背叛和困惑的表情看着我。

I didn't know what to say either.  
我也不知道该说什么。

It was at that time the doorbell rang.  
就在那时，门铃响了。

We greeted Hikari and other two stooges, in perfect harmony, might I add. I wasn't thinking at all at this point. It was a combination of the degradation, tiredness, and overwhelming circumstance that set me on autopilot. Misato arrived with Ayanami Rei and they all sat down together and watched how far Shinji and I progressed.  
我们和谐地迎接了光和其他两个傻瓜，我得说，完美无缺。此时此刻，我完全没有思考。是那种堕落感、疲惫以及压倒性的情境让我进入了自动驾驶模式。美里带着绫波零来了，他们一起坐下，观看我和真嗣的进展。

Which was nowhere. 结果是一无所获。

I tried to think about what I was doing, I mean, making a really conscious effort to pay attention. But it seemed the more I concentrated, the more mistakes I would make. 100% was the target "twister test" ratio. Right now, I think we were averaging about a 4%. It frustrated me. It _had to be my incompetent partner. It couldn't be me doing all this, I was concentrating and thinking the hardest._  
我试图思考自己在做什么，我的意思是，努力做到非常专注。但似乎我越集中注意力，犯的错误就越多。100%是目标“扭曲测试”比率。现在，我想我们平均大约只有 4%。这让我感到沮丧。一定是我的无能搭档。不可能是我做的这一切，我一直在集中精力，思考得最努力。

_

I could hear their laughter from behind the acute wail of the headphones. I didn't know if they were laughing at me or at each other. They were probably laughing at Shinji.  
我能从耳机尖锐的哀鸣声背后听到他们的笑声。我不知道他们是在笑我还是彼此。他们大概是在笑真嗣。

_Of course. I never make mistakes.  
当然。我从不犯错。_

_

I angrily threw my headphones to the ground. "That's it! I can't sink to the level of this... this... animated _turnip!" I spat. The boy had crashed down onto the mat and was lying face down on the ground. It really did disgust me._  
我愤怒地将耳机摔在地上。“够了！我不能堕落到这种……这种……动画萝卜头的水平！”我唾弃道。那男孩已经摔倒在垫子上，脸朝下趴在地上。这真的让我感到恶心。

_

"So, you give up?"  
“所以，你放弃了吗？”

Of course not; Sohryu Asuka Langley never gives up. However, I do like to bask in my glory. Nothing makes me feel happier than knowing that I have a job that no one else can do. "But you have no one else, do you?"  
当然不会；惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不放弃。不过，我喜欢沉浸在自己的荣耀中。没有什么比知道自己有一份无人能胜任的工作更让我感到快乐的了。“但你没有其他人了，不是吗？”

She closed her eyes. "Rei."  
她闭上了眼睛。“丽。”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Why don't you give it a try?"  
“为什么不试试呢？”

"Yes." "是的。"

I stood rooted to my spot as the blue haired girl casually walked over and put on new headphones. To my shock (and the shock of everyone else), Shinji and her were in perfect synchronization. Each circle, each beep, matched up exactly.  
我呆立在原地，只见蓝发女孩随意地走过去戴上新的耳机。令我（以及所有人）震惊的是，真嗣和她竟然完全同步。每一个圆圈，每一次哔声，都分毫不差。

"Well, maybe I should alter the operation and make a pair of Shinji and Rei."  
"嗯，也许我应该改变操作，制作一对碇真嗣和绫波零。"

I didn't know what to say. I tried to ask if she would give me another chance, but that would be groveling. I never grovel. Then I tried saying that it worked before and doesn't work now, but that sounded stupid even in my mind. Then I said that my damn SDATs were broken and Rei's wasn't. I think all that came out was a series of gasps and incoherent sounds.  
我不知道该说什么。我试图问她是否能再给我一次机会，但那会显得卑躬屈膝。我从不卑躬屈膝。然后我尝试说以前有效现在无效，但这听起来连我自己都觉得愚蠢。接着我说我的该死 SDAT 坏了而绫波零的没坏。我想说出来的只是一连串的喘息和含糊不清的声音。

My inability to speak finally sent me storming out of the room. "I can't stand this anymore!" and I truly meant it. I slammed the door as hard as I could in hopes of breaking it. Unfortunately, it only bounced back harmlessly. I couldn't even get a pleasurable sound, at least a door slam would satiate my rage a little bit.  
我最终因为无法说话而愤怒地冲出了房间。“我再也受不了了！”我真心这么想。我用尽全力摔门，希望能把它摔坏。不幸的是，它只是无害地弹了回来。我甚至得不到一个令人愉悦的声音，至少摔门还能稍微平息我的怒火。

I hate this. Why did I have to come to Japan? Why couldn't I stay in Germany? The Japanese with their masked emotions made no sense to me. You never knew what they were truly feeling or thinking. I felt like a stranger, even to my own Evangelion. When your Evangelion is your life, you are scared of losing it.  
我讨厌这样。为什么我非得来日本？为什么我不能留在德国？那些日本人，他们隐藏情感的方式对我来说毫无意义。你永远不知道他们真正在想什么或感受什么。我感觉自己像个陌生人，甚至对我的 EVA 也是如此。当你的 EVA 就是你的生命时，你会害怕失去它。

I felt it slowly slipping out of my grasp.  
我感觉到它正慢慢从我手中滑走。

Rei and Shinji would be made a team, and I would be left all alone. Again. Rei took my place.  
丽和真嗣会被编成一组，而我将被独自留下。又一次。丽取代了我的位置。

I think it was at that moment that I decided I didn't like Ayanami Rei.  
我想就是在那一刻，我决定我不喜欢绫波零。

I must have wandered outside for a half an hour before stepping into a convenience store. What was the point of staying inside the apartment now? The operation was no longer mine.  
我在外面徘徊了半个小时，才走进一家便利店。现在还待在公寓里有什么意义呢？行动已经不再属于我了。

"Where are the drinks?"  
“饮料在哪里？”

The pimply faced cashier boy pointed towards a row of refrigerators. I trudged over and opened the refrigerator door softly. There was really no point of being angry now, it really didn't get you anywhere. Despite my boisterous outward show, I knew that deep down inside such childish tantrums were often ignored. I don't know what possesses me to act this way, but I still do. I haven't changed since childhood.  
那个满脸青春痘的收银员男孩指向一排冰箱。我拖着脚步走过去，轻轻地打开冰箱门。现在生气真的没有意义，它根本解决不了任何问题。尽管我外表喧闹，内心深处却明白这种幼稚的脾气往往被忽视。我不知道是什么驱使我这样行事，但我依然如此。从童年起，我就未曾改变。

I don't know how long I sat there with the door open and the cold washing over me. Frankly, I didn't really care. All that went through my mind was how I couldn't finish a job that I started.  
我不知道自己在那里坐了多久，门一直开着，冷气袭来。说实话，我并不在意。脑海中唯一闪过的念头是，我无法完成已经开始的工作。

_My God, I'm pathetic. 我的天，我真是可悲。_

After about ten minutes, I heard the tinkle of the bell. Another customer. They walked slowly and purposefully to where I was squatting. Their shadow came over me, and I could see someone's reflection in the glass.  
大约十分钟后，我听到了铃铛的叮咚声。又来了一位顾客。他们缓慢而坚定地走向我蹲着的地方。他们的影子笼罩了我，我能在玻璃上看到某人的倒影。

"Um..." “呃……”

_It was Shinji. 是真嗣。_

"No, don't say anything. I already know." I really just wanted to be left alone, but it gladdened my heart that he went after me. He cared at least that much. Obviously, the operation wasn't changed or else he wouldn't be standing there. I stood up, clutching a can of _something in one hand and a sandwich in another. "My job is to pilot Eva. I have no other choice."_  
“不，什么都别说。我已经知道了。”我其实只是想一个人待着，但他的追来让我心里感到一丝温暖。至少他还在乎这一点。显然，行动没有改变，否则他不会站在那里。我站起身，一手抓着一罐东西，另一手拿着一个三明治。“我的任务是驾驶 Eva。我没有其他选择。”

_

I gave a can to Shinji, a can that I didn't even remember picking up. We walked back to Misato's apartment in companionable silence. Once I opened the door, I saw that everyone had already gone. We were alone again. Shinji and I walked out to the private balcony overlooking the city. He sat up while I jumped on top of the bench. The sunset was beautiful. "What are you going to do?" he asked.  
我递给真嗣一罐我甚至不记得拿过的罐头。我们默默地走回美里小姐的公寓。一开门，我发现大家都已经离开了。我们又独自一人了。真嗣和我走到俯瞰城市的私人阳台上。他坐下，而我跳上了长椅。夕阳很美。“你打算做什么？”他问。

My ego has a strange way of taking over my mouth when pride was at stake. "I don't know, but I know I'll put Rei and Misato to _shame!" The boldness of the remark surprised even me._  
当自尊心作祟时，我的自尊心有一种奇怪的方式控制我的嘴巴。“我不知道，但我知道我会让丽和美里都相形见绌！”这番大胆的言论甚至让我自己都感到惊讶。

_

It apparently surprised Shinji too. "You don't have to squash them."  
这显然也让真嗣感到意外。“你不必把它们压扁。”

_I don't want to squash them!  
我不想压扁它们！_

_

Didn't he know that it was more than killing this Angel now? It was a matter of overcoming obstacles, finishing what was started, and showing the world what I could do! It had nothing to do with Misato and Rei, I just wanted to show them want the Second Child was capable of. "You're thinking far too simplistic, even if you are a man. It's honor now... my pride... that's all that matters now is my dignity."  
难道他不知道现在不仅仅是消灭这个使徒吗？这是关于克服障碍，完成已经开始的事情，并向世界展示我能做什么！这与美里和绫波无关，我只是想向他们展示第二适格者的能力。“你想得太简单了，即使你是个男人。现在是荣誉……我的骄傲……现在最重要的是我的尊严。”

I wouldn't find this out until later, but when I said that, one of Misato's cameras just happened to be focused in on Shinji's face. I assumed his silence was that he was taking in my breathtaking words. Instead, he didn't speak because he had the most loving smile on his face. I had never seen a smile like that before.  
我直到后来才知道，当我那么说的时候，Misato 的一台摄像机恰好对准了 Shinji 的脸。我以为他的沉默是因为他在聆听我令人窒息的话语。然而，他之所以没有说话，是因为他脸上挂着最深情的微笑。我从未见过那样的微笑。

How I wished I saw him. Maybe then... I could have smiled back.  
我多么希望当时能看到他。也许那样...我就能回以微笑了。

### Chapter 3

It was the eighth day of the month. What month? I don't even remember. One shouldn't ask me questions where I have to _think this early in the morning. Through my bleary vision, I could see a makeshift calendar tacked up on the door. "**Three days until D-Day**," it said in screaming bold print._  
那是本月的第八天。什么月份？我甚至不记得了。一大早就不该问我需要思考的问题。透过我模糊的视线，我看到门上钉着一张临时日历。“距离 D 日还有三天，”上面用醒目的粗体字写着。

_

I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep. I was too nestled in my blanket to get up.  
我翻了个身，试图继续入睡。我裹在毯子里太舒服了，不想起床。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Ugh..." I groaned. “呃……”我呻吟道。

I heard someone start tapping their foot. "You have to get up now. You've been sleeping for too long."  
我听到有人开始用脚敲打地面。“你现在必须起床了。你已经睡得太久了。”

I opened my eyes disgustedly. "Can't you just leave me alone?!"  
我厌恶地睁开眼睛。“你就不能让我一个人待会儿吗？！”

Towering over me like a demented "Yan Can Cook", I took in the impressive sight of Ikari Shinji holding a frying pan in one hand and a spatula in the other. He was complete even down to the frilly green apron adorning his front. He looked mildly annoyed. "You've told me to leave you alone for two hours now. Your breakfast is getting cold. You have to get up _now."_  
他像一个发狂的“甄能煮”一样俯视着我，我看着碇真嗣一手拿着煎锅，一手拿着铲子，气势非凡。他甚至连那件装饰着荷叶边的绿色围裙都穿上了，看起来有些不悦。“你已经让我离开两个小时了。你的早餐都快凉了，现在你得起床了。”

_

I rubbed my eyes and sat up. Looks like he got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. The same could be said for me; my hair felt like a Halloween wig. "What time is it?" I yawned.  
我揉了揉眼睛，坐起身来。看来他今早起床的方式不对。我也是一样；我的头发感觉像是个万圣节假发。“现在几点了？”我打着哈欠问道。

"9:00. You should have been up at seven."  
"9:00。你本该七点就起床的。"

"Oh..." I didn't even remember being told to wake up before now. Why didn't Misato wake us up at 7:00 like she did yesterday? He started to leave, and I coughed to get his attention. "Wait a second."  
"哦..." 我现在都不记得有人告诉我要早起。为什么美里不像昨天那样七点叫我们起床呢？他正要离开，我咳嗽了一声以引起他的注意。"等一下。"

Shinji took off his headphones and waved the frying pan at me. "What is it?"  
真嗣摘下耳机，挥动着煎锅对我说："什么事？"

"What makes you think you can just barge into a girl's room like this? Were you watching me while I was sleeping?"  
"你怎么会觉得可以就这样闯进女孩子的房间？难道我睡觉的时候你一直在偷看？"

"Now why in the world would I do something like that?"  
"我为什么要做那种事呢？"

"Because you can't tear your eyes off me," I answered confidently. He blinked twice, and then a familiar red line crossed over the bridge of his nose. Shinji's eyes shot to the ground. Ah, there's nothing like a little embarrassment on somebody else's part to get you eager to go in the morning. He looked like a kid who just was caught doing something bad that he shouldn't have been doing. I actually felt _sorry for him. The great Asuka, feeling sorry for an underling!_  
"因为你无法把目光从我身上移开，" 我自信地回答。他眨了两下眼，然后一道熟悉的红线横跨过他的鼻梁。真嗣的目光迅速转向地面。啊，看到别人有点尴尬总是能让你早上心情愉快。他看起来就像一个刚被抓到做了不该做的事的小孩。我居然为他感到难过。伟大的明日香，居然为一个小跟班感到难过！

_

_I guess I couldn't help it.  
我想我控制不住自己。_

_

"I will give you a spine," I whispered to myself. "And Sohryu Asuka Langley always keeps her word."  
"我会给你一个脊梁，"我低声对自己说。"而惣流·明日香·兰格雷总是说到做到。"

He retreated in his kitchen while I got dressed.  
他在厨房里退避，而我则穿好衣服。

Breakfast was a rather uneventful event. We both had our headphones on, not willing to speak to the other. I think the full weight of the situation finally sunk into our heads. We were here to stay. Shinji and I agreed on a motion to signal each other when to take our headphones off.  
早餐显得相当平淡无奇。我们都戴着耳机，不愿与对方交谈。我想，情况的全部严重性终于沉入了我们的脑海。我们将在这里久留。我和真嗣约定了一个手势，用来示意何时摘下耳机。

It did get rather annoying with that SDAT player though, whenever I reached for the butter knife, so did he. More than once our fingers bumped together, and we'd always hold eye contact for a split second before turning our heads and looking away. I even felt a little heat in my cheeks.  
不过，那个 SDAT 播放器确实让人有些烦躁，每当我伸手去拿黄油刀时，他也同样如此。不止一次，我们的手指碰到了一起，每次我们都会短暂地对视一眼，然后转过头去，移开视线。我甚至感到脸颊有些发热。

_What is the matter with me?  
我这是怎么了？_

_

I assumed that it was a reaction that Shinji had that I just happened to be having because of him That's the only thing we could ever have in common, other than Eva. I hated him for being a competitor and challenging my high synch points. I hated him for getting me into this whole mess. I hated him for being able to move his Eva on the first sortie while I had to train for months to lift a finger. I even hated him for being able to look good in the mornings when I couldn't.  
我以为那是真嗣的反应，而我恰好因为他的缘故也有了同样的感受。除了 Eva，这是我们唯一可能有的共同点。我恨他作为竞争对手挑战我的高同步率。我恨他把我卷入这一切混乱。我恨他在第一次出击就能自如操控 Eva，而我却花了数月时间才能动动手指。我甚至恨他早上能神清气爽，而我却做不到。

If I had so many reasons to hate him, why didn't I feel like it?  
如果我有这么多理由恨他，为何我并不这么觉得？

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The sound of my voice rising with his snapped me out of my thoughts. My hand was raised in midair, clutching the butter knife. The yellow glob was ready to slide off. He did the motion and I took my headphones off. But not before the butter knife clattered to my plate. I felt like a fool. "What?!"  
我的声音随着他的提高而响起，打断了我的思绪。我的手悬在空中，紧握着黄油刀。黄色的油块即将滑落。他做了个动作，我摘下耳机。但在黄油刀咣当一声掉在盘子上之前。我觉得自己像个傻瓜。“什么？！”

Shinji picked up his plate and headed to the sink. "I think we've figured out the key to this SDAT player thing." I could eat freely now. Instead of the chopsticks, I used a fork to scoop up the remaining egg white on my plate. He scraped extra food into the garbage disposal and flipped the switch. I almost swore I did the same thing myself over the table. "You can't concentrate on it."  
真嗣拿起盘子走向水槽。“我想我们已经找到了这个 SDAT 播放器的关键。”我现在可以自由进食了。我没有用筷子，而是用叉子舀起盘子里剩下的蛋白。他把多余的食物刮进垃圾处理器，然后打开开关。我几乎发誓自己在桌子上也做过同样的事情。“你无法集中注意力。”

"Concentrate?" “集中注意力？”

Shinji nodded. "I found that the more you concentrate on something, the more the SDAT doesn't work."  
真嗣点头。“我发现你越专注于某件事，SDAT 就越不工作。”

I set my fork down and regarded him with a cool eye. "You mean to tell me that it only controls stuff that you don't know you're doing?"  
我放下叉子，用冷静的目光看着他。“你是想说，它只控制那些你无意识的行为？”

"Exactly. I guess Misato is trying to control our instinct so we'll react the same way."  
“正是如此。我想美里是想控制我们的本能，让我们以相同的方式反应。”

So that was it. The secret behind the SDAT. I didn't know this. What he was saying seemed to be true though, that explained the reason why I couldn't synch with him yesterday in the twister test. He was looking at me expectantly, as if I should say something else. I didn't know what to say, because I didn't even figure this out until he told me. But damned if I would admit it. "You mean to tell me that you _now figured all this out?"_  
原来如此。这就是 SDAT 背后的秘密。我之前并不知情。他所说的似乎是真的，这解释了为什么昨天在龙卷风测试中我无法与他同步。他期待地看着我，仿佛我应该说些什么。我不知道该说什么，因为我直到他告诉我才明白这一点。但我绝不会承认。“你是想说，你现在才搞清楚这一切？”

_

He blinked again. "I said that we both figured this out, remember? I couldn't have done it without your help."  
他又眨了眨眼。“我说过是我们俩一起想出来的，记得吗？没有你的帮助我做不到。”

"But... let's make it perfectly clear that I thought it out first, all right?"  
“但是……让我们明确一点，是我先想出来的，好吗？”

Shinji looked perplexed, but he agreed. "Fine."  
真嗣看起来有些困惑，但还是同意了。“好吧。”

I leaned back so that my chair balanced on two legs. A part of me felt bad about lying to myself like this, but the other and more dominant part said that I knew it all along. I simply never put it into coherent thought. It was such a trivial matter that my brain didn't think it was important enough to remember.  
我向后靠去，让椅子仅靠两条腿保持平衡。一部分的我对自己这样撒谎感到内疚，但另一部分，也是更占主导的部分，却说我一直都知道真相。我只是从未将其整理成连贯的思绪。这件事太微不足道，我的大脑认为它不值得记住。

_That'll work.  那样行得通。_

_

I brought all four legs of the chair back onto the floor with a slam. "Let me help you with that."  
我将椅子的四条腿重重地放回地面。“让我帮你吧。”

_Whoa, did I just say that?  
哇哦，我刚才是那么说的吗？_

_

"I'll wash and you rinse." I strode to the dishes and picked up a washcloth. "... I'm only helping because I have to, got it?" I started to scrub my plate clean.  
“我来洗，你来冲。”我大步走向碗碟，拿起一块洗碗布。“……我只是在帮忙，因为不得不做，明白了吗？”我开始用力擦洗我的盘子。

He turned on the water and said acidly, "Of course. You're too stuck up to do anything for anyone else but yourself."  
他打开水龙头，酸溜溜地说：“当然。你太高傲了，除了自己，你谁也不会为谁做任何事。”

Instead of smacking him into an early grave as I would have done under normal circumstances, I paused my scouring and beamed at him. "I do believe you are growing a spine!" Seems that my promise would be fulfilled a lot faster than I thought!  
"我没有像平时那样一巴掌把他扇进坟墓，而是暂停了搜寻，对他露出了笑容。“我相信你正在长出脊梁骨！”看来我的承诺会比我想象中更快实现！”

Shinji didn't stop rinsing. "I always had a spine. It just takes a person like _you to reveal it."_  
真嗣没有停止冲洗。“我一向都有脊梁骨。只是需要像你这样的人来激发它。”

_

Ouch, touchy. I wasn't hurt at all. In fact, I was complimented. It takes a very special person like me to do good in the world. I laughed cheekily. "Sorry. I guess I let the apron fool me into thinking you were a sissy."  
"哎呀，真敏感。我一点也没受伤。事实上，我感到被夸奖了。像我这样特别的人才能在这个世界上做好事。我调皮地笑了。“抱歉。我大概是让围裙误导，以为你是个娘娘腔。””

He didn't answer. All my signs went on red alert. It was this wonderful, miraculous thing called woman's instinct, and right now it was going off like crazy. I must have touched some nerve in him. I didn't feel like I was in physical danger, but I felt myself losing control. Exposing vulnerability. Not necessarily in me, but in him.  
他没有回答。我所有的警报信号都亮起了红灯。这就是那个美妙、神奇的东西，叫做女人的直觉，而现在它正疯狂地响起。我一定是触动了他某根神经。我并不觉得自己处于身体上的危险，但我感到自己正在失去控制。暴露脆弱。不一定是我，而是他。

_Your goal is to give him confidence, not take it away!  
你的目标是给他信心，而不是夺走它！_

_

I cleared my throat after an eternity of just the clinking of dishes. "So..." I realized at that moment that I knew nothing about Shinji. Sure, we breathed the same air and slept in the same apartment, but we didn't talk about anything. Give me a break, I had only known the guy for a maximum of three days.  
在一段仿佛只有餐具碰撞声的永恒之后，我清了清喉咙。“所以……”我意识到那一刻我对真嗣一无所知。当然，我们呼吸着同样的空气，睡在同一个公寓里，但我们从不谈论任何事情。拜托，我最多才认识这家伙三天。

We still didn't say anything, and what followed was the longest silence that _I think I'd ever been through. It would have been all right if it was companionable or easygoing, but it was neither. I guess I just didn't know what to say._  
我们依旧沉默不语，接下来的那段沉默，我想是我经历过的最漫长的。如果它是愉快的或是轻松的，那倒也无妨，但事实并非如此。我想我只是不知道该说些什么。

_

Ikari Shinji. The Third Child. What else did I know? What else did _he know?_  
碇真嗣。第三适格者。我还知道些什么？他又知道些什么？

_

"Wow, you two are working really well together."  
“哇，你们俩合作得真好。”

Shinji looked over his shoulder, but I kept facing forward. I sneered at the sink.  
真嗣回头看了一眼，但我依旧面朝前方。我对着水槽嗤之以鼻。

Misato stepped into the kitchen, trailing her fingers on the table as she went to us. "I don't think I've ever seen the great Sohryu Asuka Langley doing dishes before. Willingly."  
美里走进厨房，手指顺着桌子滑向我们。“我可从没见过伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷自愿洗碗。真是难得。”

I washed the last spoon and threw it to Shinji's side. "I don't _do dishes because I don't _have to, Misato."__  
我洗完最后一把勺子，扔到真嗣那边。“我不洗碗是因为我不需要洗，美里。”

__

"Don't get her in a worse mood, Misato." Shinji requested tiredly. He untied the bow in the back and hung his apron on a hook jutting out from the sink. "Please?"  
"别让她更生气了，美里。" 真嗣疲倦地请求道。他解开背后的蝴蝶结，将围裙挂在从水槽伸出的钩子上。"拜托了？"

"All right." "好的。"

I don't have to sit here and take this shit. "I'm going to take a shower now," I announced. Last night, I didn't take a bath. It must have slipped my mind while I was working on plans for world domination. Well, maybe not world domination, but I found that I was so exhausted by the day's grueling events that once I hit the futon, I was out.  
我可没必要坐在这里忍受这些破事。“我现在要去洗澡了，”我宣布道。昨晚我没洗澡，可能是在策划世界统治时忘了。好吧，也许不是世界统治，但那天发生的事情让我筋疲力尽，一倒在蒲团上就睡着了。

Actually, I'm like that every day. I'm blessed with this rare gift of being able to sleep when I want to. I could sleep through an Angel attack if I wanted to. Here's the good news, Misato finally gave me a futon and a blanket so I didn't have to sleep on the couch. But for some odd reason, she didn't move Shinji's bed to the room I was staying in. His bed stayed in his room.  
实际上，我每天都这样。我拥有这个稀有的天赋，想睡就能睡。如果我想，我甚至能在使徒攻击时睡着。好消息是，美里终于给了我一个蒲团和一条毯子，这样我就不用睡沙发了。但奇怪的是，她没有把真嗣的床搬到我住的房间。他的床还留在他自己的房间里。

Even though she wants us to synchronize, we can't sleep in the same room. Politics were involved, for now.  
尽管她希望我们同步，但我们不能睡在同一个房间。目前牵扯到了政治因素。

Fine by me. 我无所谓。

I walked to the bathroom, followed closely by Misato dragging Shinji. He had no problem about following me to the bathroom, the pervert, but he doesn't want to be present when I take a shower.  
我走向浴室，美里紧跟着拖着真嗣。他对我去浴室没意见，这变态，但他不想在我洗澡时在场。

They stationed themselves outside the bathroom. Once I stood there for about a minute doing absolutely nothing, I felt confident that no one would look at me. And what did I care if he did? He was just another member of the male race, unable to resist the siren's song. He did it once before, why not again?  
他们驻足在浴室外。我站在那里大约一分钟，什么也没做，感觉自信满满，没人会注意到我。就算他看了又怎样？他不过是男性种族中的一员，无法抵挡那塞壬的歌声。他以前做过一次，为何不能再做？

"And no peeking, got it?"  
"不许偷看，明白吗？"

"Y-Yes." "明-明白了。"

I didn't hear Misato, so I assumed she wasn't answering. I didn't know whether to take off my clothes quickly or slowly. I opted for the latter. Not only would it not introduce me to the chill air as quickly, but also, I wanted to give this Ikari Shinji some kind of test.  
我没听到美里回应，便以为她没在回答。我不知道该迅速还是缓慢地脱掉衣服。我选择了后者。这样不仅不会让我那么快接触到寒冷的空气，而且，我也想给这个碇真嗣某种考验。

_A test.  一个考验。_

_

Since I knew nothing about him as a person, I could at least experiment with his character. I knew he had no spine (well, maybe shards of it), was an early morning person and a confirmed pervert. He tried to look at me once before when I was putting on my plugsuit. Let's see if he learned his lesson.  
既然我对他的为人一无所知，至少可以试验一下他的性格。我知道他没有骨气（或许只有些碎片），是个早起的人，还是个公认的变态。之前有一次我穿插入栓服时，他试图偷看我。看看他是否吸取了教训。

_I hope so.  希望如此。_

_

_"Are you still out there, Shinji?"  
"真嗣，你还在外面吗？"_

_

"Yes."  "是的。"

The first things that had to go were the two neural plugs in my hair. I was proud of my position as an Evangelion pilot, and not afraid to show it. Unfortunately, no one else but the three pilots and NERV knew that these plugs are actually used in the actual combat situations. Most people at school just thought they were fancy hair clips. Of course, I told them otherwise. I set those on the bathroom sink.  
首先得摘掉的是我头发里的两个神经插头。作为一名 EVA 驾驶员，我对此感到自豪，并且毫不掩饰。不幸的是，除了我们三位驾驶员和 NERV 之外，没有人知道这些插头实际上是在实战中使用的。学校里的大多数人只认为它们是时髦的发夹。当然，我告诉他们并非如此。我把它们放在了浴室的洗手台上。

_

No, I can't do this.  
不，我做不到。

Without really thinking about it, I took off my shorts and my blouse as fast as I could. After unclasping my bra and pulling down my panties, I opened the shower door and slammed it behind me. The door offered not privacy whatsoever, it was made of that contorted glass that was supposed to throw light and blur your line of sight. I was a doll in a box.  
没怎么多想，我迅速脱掉了短裤和衬衫。解开胸罩，拉下内裤后，我打开淋浴间的门，砰地一声关上。那扇门根本不提供任何隐私，它是由那种扭曲的玻璃制成的，本意是散射光线，模糊视线。我就像个盒子里的玩偶。

"I caught you peeking at me, you pervert!"  
“我抓到你偷看我了，你这个变态！”

I could see Shinji poking his head around the corner with one hand over his eyes. "I didn't!" he insisted.  
我看见真嗣用手遮着眼睛，从角落探出头来。“我没有！”他坚持道。

"Oh geez Shinji, would you stop the panicked approach already?" That was the one thing I hated most about men, they pretended to be innocent when they really were not. I pulled a lever to the side and turned on the water. Of course, it came out ice cold. I squealed in surprise and backed up against a corner to escape it.  
“哦，天哪，真嗣，你能别这么慌张吗？”这是我最讨厌男人的一点，他们总在实际上并不无辜的时候装作无辜。我拉了一下旁边的杠杆，打开了水。当然，水冰冷刺骨。我惊叫一声，退到角落躲避。

I saw a shadow quickly manifest itself near the entrance to the bathroom. "What's wrong, Asuka?"  
我看到一个影子迅速在浴室入口处显现。“怎么了，明日香？”

The water was getting somewhat bearable now, but I had little goose bumps all over my body. Since the shower was so small, there wasn't really any place to escape to. The cold water drenched my legs. "It's your damn shower! It... it was freezing!"  
水现在变得稍微能忍受了，但我全身还是起了鸡皮疙瘩。因为淋浴间太小，实在无处可逃。冷水浸透了我的双腿。“这是你的该死的淋浴！它……它冷得要命！”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

He's sorry? What for?! He's always the first to apologize when something goes wrong. "Why are you saying sorry? It's not like you could control it!" Did I find that annoying? The answer is yes. It only proved my housebroken male theory.  
他道歉？为什么？！每次出问题他总是第一个道歉。“你为什么要道歉？又不是你能控制的！”我是不是觉得这很烦人？答案是肯定的。这只会证明我关于他是个家养男性的理论。

Shinji didn't say anything more for now, instead opting to retreat from the door. Through the glass door, I could see his feet and legs across the entrance. He must be lying down. Sort of like a guard. I squeezed some of Misato's shampoo into my palm and lathered it in my hair. The herbal scent was overpowering, but smelled great. I don't think my regular shampoo smelled this good.  
真嗣没有再说什么，而是选择从门口退开。透过玻璃门，我能看到他的脚和腿横在入口处。他一定是在躺着。有点像守卫。我挤了一些美里小姐的洗发水到手掌中，揉搓在头发上。草药的香味很浓烈，但闻起来很棒。我不觉得我平常用的洗发水有这么好闻。

"That smells really nice." Shinji's voice sounded pinched.  
“这味道真好闻。” 真嗣的声音听起来有些紧绷。

It sounded like a conversation starter to me, so I went along with it. It was better than talking to myself. "Yeah, I guess." I took in a deep breath and let the scent fill my lungs. "I wish I had shampoo like this." Feeling infinitely more relaxed now, I let the shampoo work through my hair. Little rivulets of foam ran down my sides and collected near the drain. I didn't want to get out.  
我觉得这像是个开场白，于是就顺着接了下去。总比自言自语强。“是啊，我想也是。”我深吸了一口气，让香气充满我的肺部。“真希望我也有这样的洗发水。”现在我感觉无比放松，让洗发水在我的头发中发挥作用。小小的泡沫流顺着我的两侧流下，汇集在排水口附近。我不想出去。

"What kind of shampoo do you use, normally?"  
“你平时用什么洗发水？”

I stopped and thought about that. It must be in one of my hordes of unpacked boxes. "Uh, I think its St. Ives."  
我停下思考了一下。那一定在我那堆未拆封的箱子里。“呃，我想是圣艾夫斯。”

"Oh, that's nice." “哦，那挺好的。”

He didn't know what to say because he'd never heard of it before. Of course not, it was a European brand. "Why do you care?"  
他不知道该说什么，因为他以前从未听说过。当然没听过，那是个欧洲品牌。“你为什么关心这个？”

"I don't know. Misato told me to talk to you while you were in there."  
"我不知道。美里让我在你洗澡的时候跟你聊聊。"

Again, the pinched voice. Misato said that? After rinsing my hair out from all shampoo, I followed up with the conditioner of the same brand. It didn't smell as nice as the shampoo did, but it did its job. "Well, I don't like talking while I'm taking a shower."  
又是那种压抑的声音。美里说的？在用同品牌的护发素冲洗掉所有洗发水后，我继续使用护发素。它的香味没有洗发水那么好闻，但效果还是不错的。“嗯，我不喜欢洗澡时说话。”

"I don't either." "我也不喜欢。"

"Then let's _both be quiet."_  
“那我们就都保持安静吧。”

_

He was thinking about it. Shinji finally asked, "Well, what am I supposed to do in the meantime?"  
他在思考这个问题。真嗣终于问道：“那么，我在这期间该做什么呢？”

"I don't know!" I sighed in exasperation. "Why don't you just listen to me taking a shower?" It was a better suggestion than talking. Me, I liked to savor the moment. Maybe I'd grow into talking with someone who was standing right outside my open bathroom door, but for now, the experience was still new to me.  
“我不知道！”我叹了口气，感到有些恼火。“你为什么不干脆听我洗澡呢？”这总比聊天要好。我嘛，喜欢细细品味这一刻。也许我会逐渐习惯与站在我敞开的浴室门外的人交谈，但目前，这种体验对我来说还很新鲜。

Not that it bothered me, of _course, but I'd like to take things a little slower._  
当然，这并没有困扰我，但我希望事情能稍微放慢一些。

_

Shinji didn't say anything else, and neither did I.  
真嗣没有再说什么，我也没有。

Once I got out of the shower and toweled myself off, I shot a glance at the doorway. I hoped to catch him in the act and pummel him to death, but unfortunately, he wasn't looking.  
我洗完澡，擦干身体后，瞥了一眼门口。我希望当场抓住他并把他打死，但遗憾的是，他并没有看过来。

_Damn._

_

I was impressed. Very impressed. No one had ever lasted that long when faced with my body before. I don't mean to sound like a cheap whore when I say that, but it's true. Even on days when I don't want to show myself off, somehow the men always gawk. But what was it about me that they liked, anyway?  
我被深深打动了。非常打动。在我面前，从未有人能坚持那么久。我这么说并非自贬为廉价娼妓，但事实如此。即便在我不想展示自己的日子里，男人们也总是目不转睛。但究竟是我身上的什么吸引了他们呢？

Did anyone pay attention to my Evangelion piloting skills or superior intellect?  
有人关注过我的 EVA 驾驶技术或卓越才智吗？

"Do you want me to bring you fresh clothes?"  
“你需要我给你拿些干净衣服吗？”

I took a lock of hair between my fingers and started twisting it. It was a much darker color now, rich like chocolate and streaked with cherry sauce. I wondered how water could change color like that so quickly. It almost reminded me of a thundercloud. One time in college I wondered why thunderclouds were dark despite it all being made of water. No one I encountered had the answer to that.  
我用手指夹起一缕头发开始扭转。现在它的颜色深了许多，浓郁如巧克力，夹杂着樱桃酱的纹理。我好奇水是如何如此迅速地改变颜色的。这几乎让我想起了雷雨云。大学时有一次我疑惑为什么雷雨云是暗的，尽管它们都是由水构成的。我遇到的没有人能解答这个问题。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

I sighed. "No, I'll get it myself." Then I added slyly, "I bet you're just dying to get into my lingerie stash, aren't you?" Some sputtering sounds from him. I used one towel to wrap myself in and another to wrap my hair. I don't like wet hair on my shoulders; it feels funny. I picked up the rest of my clothes, slightly damp from the water run off.  
我叹了口气。“不，我自己来吧。”然后我狡黠地补充道，“我打赌你一定很想看看我的内衣收藏，对吧？”他发出一阵呛咳声。我用一条毛巾裹住自己，另一条包住头发。我不喜欢湿发贴在肩上；感觉怪怪的。我捡起其余的衣服，它们因水流而略显潮湿。

_Time for test number two.  
是时候进行第二个测试了。_

_

Once I stepped outside, I made it a point to stand almost directly over top of him. "Did you say something else, Shinji?" I whispered. The towel covering my body was large enough to cover the bare necessities, but small enough to leave little to the imagination. Now I would find out if he was like those dime a dozen men I encountered in college.  
一踏出门外，我特意站在他正上方。“你刚才还说了什么吗，真嗣？”我低声问道。裹在身上的毛巾足够遮住关键部位，但又短得让人遐想连篇。现在，我倒要看看他是否也像大学里那些随处可见的男人一样。

You know, the type that got drunk off their asses and woke up the next morning wondering how in the world they thought the woman lying next to them was beautiful.  
你知道的，那种喝得烂醉如泥，第二天早上醒来还纳闷自己怎么会觉得身边的女人美若天仙的家伙。

That kind. 就是那种人。

_

"Well, Third Child?" "那么，三号机驾驶员？"

The look on his face lifted my spirits. Sohryu Asuka Langley still had it in her. His face turned as red as a stoplight and he sputtered for a little bit. I was about to tack him up in my mind as another "dimey" when he turned his head and thus looked away from me.  
他脸上的表情让我心情大好。惣流·明日香·兰格雷依旧魅力不减。他的脸红得像交通灯一样，结巴了一会儿。我正准备在心里把他归类为另一个“呆子”时，他转过头去，不再看我。

"What's wrong, Third?" "怎么了，三号？"

He just stared at the ground, seemingly composing himself. Of course, he had probably never seen anyone as gorgeous as me before in his life. "M-My name is Shinji." He turned his head and looked at me again, but this time he was looking into my eyes and nowhere else. "I call you Asuka, why can't you call me Shinji?"  
"他只是盯着地面，似乎在努力平复情绪。当然，他这辈子可能从未见过像我这么迷人的人。“我……我的名字是真嗣。”他转过头再次看向我，这次他的目光直视我的眼睛，没有移开。“我叫你明日香，你为什么不能叫我真嗣？””

I shifted in the doorway. Come to think of it, I hadn't really called him anything else other than a pervert, idiot, or Third. "I don't recall giving you permission to call me by my first name." I wanted to let him now just who was in control of the situation.  
"我在门口挪了挪位置。仔细想想，我确实没怎么叫过他的名字，除了变态、白痴或者第三适格者。“我不记得有允许你直呼我的名字。”我想让他明白，谁才是这场对话的主导者。”

Instead of just sitting there and taking it, he scrambled to his feet and glared at me. "Why do you have to be so difficult?"  
"他没有只是坐在那里忍受，而是迅速站起身来，瞪着我。“你为什么总是这么难搞？””

"Why do you have to be so stupid?" I shot back.  
"你为什么非得这么蠢？" 我反驳道。

"I'd rather be stupid than what you are! Touji called you the Devil..." His voice grew cold. "... and I'm starting to believe it's true."  
"我宁愿蠢也不愿像你这样！东治说你是魔鬼……" 他的声音变得冰冷。"……我开始相信这是真的了。"

I gasped. That was something that one of the stooges always called me. It seems that he picked up on it too. "The Devil?! Listen here Shinji," I poked his chest. "I've only _seen hell before, but I never ruled it!"_  
我倒吸一口凉气。这是那些跟班们常用来称呼我的词。看来他也学会了。 "魔鬼？！听着，真嗣，" 我戳了戳他的胸口。"我只在地狱边缘徘徊过，但从没统治过它！"

_

"Then why do you want to make it feel like it, for both of us?"  
"那为什么你要让我们俩都感觉像是在地狱一样？"

"I'm not trying to make this hell, you idiot! And stop shouting at me!"  
"我并不是想制造这种地狱，你这个白痴！还有，别再对我大喊大叫了！"

He quieted down, but you could still see him shaking with suppressed anger. I really didn't know where it was coming from, because I know I haven't been trying to set him off.  
他安静了下来，但你仍能看到他因压抑的愤怒而颤抖。我真的不知道这怒气从何而来，因为我知道自己并没有试图激怒他。

_Ikari Shinji, why are you so mad?  
碇真嗣，你为什么这么生气？_

_

"I'm trying to get through this, but you're just being... being..."  
“我正努力度过这一切，但你只是在……在……”

"Being what, Third?" I challenged. He didn't dare look at my face, and this made me madder. He was still sniveling. No one likes a boy with no confidence, and me least of all. I did the thing I knew how to do.  
“在什么，第三？”我质问道。他不敢直视我的脸，这让我更加愤怒。他还在抽泣。没人喜欢一个没有自信的男孩，尤其是我。我做了我知道该怎么做的事。

I slapped him. 我扇了他一巴掌。

It wasn't a slap meant to hurt, more to insult than anything else. If he was weak-willed enough to let a woman walk all over him, he shouldn't even be a man. I fully knew the consequences of my action before I did it, and I hoped it wouldn't go down _that road._  
这一巴掌并非为了伤害，更多的是为了羞辱。如果他软弱到任由女人摆布，那他根本不配称为男人。我在动手前完全清楚后果，只希望事情不会发展到那一步。

_

Test number three. You've passed the first two. What about this one?  
第三项测试。你已经通过了前两项。这一项呢？

Hitting me back would deny him the right to be forever called a man. Not doing anything at all and crying about it would also have the same consequence. He did neither. Instead, he stormed out and went to the solace of his room. I pursued him, fully intending to barge in. Shinji slammed the door in my face. Two inches more and my nose would have been broken. I felt the walls shake.  
回击我会剥夺他永远被称为男人的权利。什么都不做，只会哭诉同样会带来这种后果。他两者都没选。相反，他怒气冲冲地离开，躲进了自己的房间。我紧随其后，打算直接闯进去。真嗣在我面前猛地关上门。再偏两英寸，我的鼻子就断了。我感觉到墙壁在震动。

This was getting heated. Shinji really surprised me: while I didn't think he had any backbone, he was matching me word for word. Was it a side effect of being forced to spend three days isolated from the world? Or was he noticing my mannerisms? Was this crazy synch test actually going to work?  
情况越来越紧张了。真嗣真的让我惊讶：虽然我认为他没有骨气，但他却在言语上与我针锋相对。这是被迫与世隔绝三天的副作用吗？还是他注意到了我的举止？这场疯狂的同步测试真的会奏效吗？

"Fine!" I shouted. "Ignore your duty as an Eva pilot! I knew you couldn't make it. You're way too pathetic to even _think about it. You should leave it to women like me who know what we're doing!"_  
“好啊！”我喊道。“无视你作为 Eva 驾驶员的职责吧！我就知道你做不到。你太可悲了，根本不配去想这件事。你应该让像我这样知道自己在做什么的女人来接手！”

_

He didn't answer. This made me madder. I stormed to where I knew the nearest video camera was and stood in its line of sight. I waved my clothes at it like a soldier brandishing his sword. "Misato! I know you can see me! Get your _ass over here right now!"_  
他没有回答。这让我更加恼火。我冲到我知道的最近的摄像头前，站在它的视野中。我挥舞着衣服，就像士兵挥舞着他的剑。"美里！我知道你能看到我！马上过来这里！"

_

What was I supposed to do now? My synch partner couldn't make it, but he didn't have to drag me down with him. I could ask Misato if I could synch with Rei and have her defeat the Angel with me. Or, maybe I could do it alone. Anything else but this, I can't take it.  
我现在该怎么办？我的同步搭档来不了，但他不必拖我下水。我可以问美里是否能和绫波同步，让她和我一起击败使徒。或者，也许我可以独自完成。除了这个，我无法忍受其他任何事。

Seconds later, there was a gentle knock on the door. "What's going on, Asuka?"  
几秒钟后，门上传来轻轻的敲击声。"怎么了，明日香？"

I rushed to the door and tried to pull it open. It didn't move. "Let me out. Now."  
我冲向门，试图拉开它。门纹丝不动。“让我出去。立刻。”

Misato ordered me to stand back. I merely let my hands off it. She opened the door and crashed into me. "What? What is it?"  
美里命令我退后。我只是松开了手。她打开门，猛地撞在我身上。“什么？怎么了？”

I angrily pointed at Shinji's slammed door. "You've got a grumpy teenage child on your hands! He's being a stubborn jackass!"  
我生气地指向真嗣紧闭的房门。“你手上有个脾气暴躁的青少年！他现在固执得像个倔驴！”

Misato looked like she didn't believe what I was saying, but then she caught sight of Shinji's room. She grabbed my wrist and dragged me over to the door. I yanked that out of her grasp and crossed my arms.  
美里看起来不相信我说的，但随后她看到了真嗣的房间。她抓住我的手腕，把我拖到门口。我挣脱她的手，交叉双臂。

"Shinji? Are you in there?" Misato knocked on the door.  
"真嗣？你在里面吗？" 美里敲了敲门。

"Of course he's in there, the idiot."  
"他当然在里面，那个笨蛋。"

"Go away." “走开。”

What? What?! I was doing that poor spineless jerk a favor by gracing him with my presence for three days! Most men would give their right _leg for an opportunity like this with me. No, I wasn't narcissistic enough to compliment myself that much (well, maybe a bit), but if there's anything that I hated more than wet hair on my shoulders, it was wasting my time. My time was precious._  
什么？什么？！我屈尊陪那个没骨气的家伙三天，已经是帮了他大忙！大多数男人可是愿意付出一切来换取与我共度如此时光的机会。不，我还没自恋到那种程度（好吧，也许有点），但如果有什么比湿发搭在肩上更让我讨厌的，那就是浪费我的时间。我的时间可是宝贵的。

_

Misato glared at me. "Shinji, I'm opening—"  
美里瞪着我。"真嗣，我要开——"

She didn't get the chance to finish her sentence because I had kicked the door open. Whirling into the room like a woman possessed, I glimpsed the boy lying down on his bed with headpieces in his ears. "Get up!"  
她没机会说完，因为我已经一脚踢开了门。像被附身般旋风似的闯进房间，我瞥见那男孩正躺在床上，头戴耳机。"起来！"

He didn't make any move to stand. In fact, he just shoved a pillow over his head and attempted to block out my words. Now I was starting to get mad. "I said get up!"  
他没有任何起身的动作。实际上，他只是把一个枕头盖在头上，试图屏蔽我的话。现在我开始生气了。“我说了，起来！”

"Asuka, stop. Shinji, can you hear me?"  
“明日香，停下。真嗣，你能听到我吗？”

I watched him and seethed. He clamped the pillow even more tightly. Let the idiot suffocate himself then! I hated that even though he was the one who slammed the door in my face, he still got more attention than I did from Misato. "I'm leaving."  
我看着他，怒火中烧。他把枕头压得更紧了。那就让这个傻瓜自己窒息吧！我讨厌即使是他先在我面前摔门，他仍然比我从美里那里得到更多的关注。“我要走了。”

_Why did this spineless boy find someone else to care about him before I found someone who cared about me?  
为什么这个懦弱的男孩在我找到关心我的人之前，就已经找到了关心他的人？_

_

"You will stay right here, Asuka." A new voice, but one I knew too well. I spun around and saw Kaji standing in the door. I would have greeted him with a fierce hug and a hello but I was rooted to my spot. Why was Kaji here? "Asuka, we need to talk." He paused, and then added, "With Captain Katsuragi's permission, of course."  
“你就在这里待着，明日香。”一个新声音，但我再熟悉不过。我转过身，看到加持站在门口。我本想给他一个热情的拥抱并打声招呼，但我却僵在原地。加持为什么会在这里？“明日香，我们需要谈谈。”他停顿了一下，然后补充道，“当然，是在葛城指挥官的允许下。”

I looked back at Misato. She had sat down at the head of the bed but made no move to touch Shinji.  
我回头看向美里。她已经坐在床头，但没有试图去触碰真嗣。

"I'm going with Kaji." I don't think I left much room for argument. "I'll be back."  
"我要和加持一起去。" 我想我没留多少争论的余地。"我会回来的。"

Not that I particularly wanted to come back, but I needed sometime alone with Kaji. One of the reasons I like him so much is because he always made me feel good when I was talking to him. Like my problems were his problems too, and he actually cared enough to listen to me speak. I don't want to sound sappy when I say this, but he made me feel loved.  
并非我特别想回来，只是我需要和加持独处一会儿。我喜欢他的原因之一，就是和他交谈时，他总让我感觉很好。仿佛我的问题也是他的问题，他真的在乎到愿意倾听我说话。我不想说得太过感伤，但他让我感受到了被爱。

Maybe that's why I loved him in return.  
也许这就是我爱上他的原因。

I let Kaji lead me out of the room and out onto the balcony. The sun shone directly overhead. I couldn't help but groan; we were only halfway through the first day. Second day if you don't count that the official document that was signed yesterday. The one that said Shinji and I were a team instead of Rei.  
我让加持带我走出房间，来到阳台上。阳光直射头顶。我不禁呻吟起来；我们才刚刚过完第一天的一半。如果不算昨天签署的那份正式文件的话，可以说是第二天了。那份文件上写着我和真嗣是一组，而不是绫波。

"Why do I have to do this?" I pouted. Kaji gave me a look that said, "Why do you have to ask?" I understood it clearly and sank down onto the bench. "How come I couldn't be paired with Ayanami Rei?"  
“为什么我非得做这个？”我噘嘴抱怨。加持给了我一个眼神，仿佛在说：“你为什么要问呢？”我清楚地理解了他的意思，便坐到了长椅上。“为什么我不能和绫波零一组？”

Kaji pulled up his pant legs before he sat down, revealing his wrinkled socks. "The Asuka I know wouldn't give up so easily."  
加持坐下前卷起了裤腿，露出了皱巴巴的袜子。“我认识的明日香可不会这么轻易放弃。”

"I'm not the one who's giving up," I insisted. "_He was the one who slammed the door on _me."__  
“放弃的人不是我，”我坚持道，“是他对我摔门而去的。”

__

"Ah... but I do remember you being the one who walked out on him yesterday."  
“啊……但我记得昨天是你离开他的。”

Indignant, I crossed my arms. "It was his fault. You don't understand... He's so... not like you, Kaji! He's spineless, a pervert, housebroken, and just plain annoying! I can't stand one more day under the same roof as him."  
我愤愤不平地交叉双臂。“那是他的错。你不明白……他和你完全不一样，加持！他没骨气，是个变态，被驯服了，还特别烦人！我一天也受不了和他同住一个屋檐下了。”

Kaji scratched the two-day-old stubble on his chin. "That may be, but you'd be showing weakness if you quit now. This is what piloting Evangelion is all about. They chose you because they know that you can handle it. They chose you over the First Child." He stopped. "And... the Third chose _you over the First."_  
加治挠了挠下巴上两天未刮的胡茬。“或许如此，但如果你现在放弃，就是在示弱。驾驶 EVA 正是如此。他们选择你，是因为他们知道你能应付。他们选择了你，而不是第一适格者。”他顿了顿。“而且……第三适格者也选择了你，而不是第一适格者。”

_

It took a moment for the words to sink in, and when they finally did, I don't think I understood it. Did he say what I thought he said? "Me?"  
这些话需要片刻才能消化，当它们终于被理解时，我不确定我是否真的明白了。他是说我理解的那个意思吗？“我？”

He shrugged. "I don't know. After you left yesterday, Miss Horaki insisted he go after you. Shinji didn't really move. Misato started insisting that the First and the Third should be made a pair." He gazed at me, trying to figure out what to say next. "There were two other boys in the room..."  
他耸了耸肩。“我不清楚。昨天你离开后，堀木小姐坚持让他去追你。真嗣并没有真正行动。美里开始坚持要让第一适格者和第三适格者组成一对。”他注视着我，试图找出接下来该说什么。“房间里还有另外两个男孩……”

I snorted. "The other two stooges? Don't worry, they're not important."  
我嗤之以鼻。“另外那两个傻瓜？别担心，他们无关紧要。”

"Well, the one with light brown hair said that Shinji should be able to choose. It was his mission, after all. Shinji sort of looked at Misato, and then at the First. Then he got up and said he was going to find you."  
“那个浅棕色头发的说，真嗣应该有选择的权利。毕竟，这是他的任务。真嗣看了看美里，又看了看第一适格者。然后他站起来说他要去找你。”

I didn't know what to say. That idiot actually... chose me? Everyone, even I, knew that the operation should have been changed to make a pair of Shinji and Rei. They mastered the twister test before Shinji and I even got one circle together. "How did you know this?"  
我不知该说什么。那个白痴居然...选择了我？所有人，包括我自己，都知道行动应该改为真嗣和绫波搭档。他们在真嗣和我连一个圈都没完成之前就掌握了旋转测试。“你怎么知道的？”

He grinned. "There are cameras all over that room, Asuka. Misato didn't want me to come in for fear of _distracting you."_  
他咧嘴一笑。“那房间到处都是摄像头，明日香。美里不想让我进去，怕打扰你。”

_

I smirked at the floor. "Wow, Misato can read me that well?"  
我对着地板轻蔑一笑。“哇，美里这么了解我吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

We both laughed. 我们俩都笑了。

Ikari Shinji chose Sohryu Asuka Langley. There was no escaping that simple fact. "Still, that boy is one odd character. I mean..." I turned to Kaji for a confirmation. "If you were Shinji... I mean, if you could imagine being in his shoes... who would you..."  
碇真嗣选择了惣流·明日香·兰格雷。这是一个无法逃避的简单事实。“不过，那男孩真是个怪人。我是说……”我转向加持寻求确认。“如果你是真嗣……我是说，如果你能想象自己站在他的立场上……你会选择谁……”

Kaji didn't have to say anything, I already knew the answer. He would have picked Rei over me. Even though it was a make believe scenario, hearing the words "Kaji wouldn't have chosen me" in my mind was enough. It hurt me.  
加持无需多言，我已经知道答案。他会选择绫波而不是我。尽管这只是一个假设的情景，但脑海中回响着“加持不会选择我”这句话，已经足够让我心痛。

He spoke softly. "He had enough confidence in you to finish the job."  
他轻声说道。“他对你完成任务有足够的信心。”

"Even though he has no confidence in himself."  
"即使他对自己毫无信心。"

"Then make him learn." Kaji nudged me in the ribs. "If anyone can make the impossible happen, it's you. And... you're beautiful to boot. You'll be synchronized in no time."  
"那就让他学习。" 加持用胳膊肘顶了顶我，"如果有人能让不可能变为可能，那就是你。而且...你还美得惊人。你们很快就会同步的。"

I narrowed my eyes suspiciously. "Fine. I'll do it. But if he gets on my nerves, I'll scrap him and defeat this Angel myself."  
我怀疑地眯起眼睛。 "好吧。我会做的。但如果他惹恼了我，我会放弃他，亲自击败这个使徒。"

"If that was possible, we'd have done it already." He sighed and stood up. Kaji offered me his hand to help me on my feet. "Be tolerant of him, because you're going to need it for a long, long time."  
"如果那有可能，我们早就做了。" 他叹了口气，站起身来。加持向我伸出手，帮助我站起来。"对他宽容些，因为你将需要很长时间去适应。"

I assumed he meant we'd be pilots for a long time, that's why I should at least try to get along with him. I started to walk, but instead of going inside with me, he pulled my arm back and halted me. "Wait, Asuka, there's something that you have to know."  
我以为他指的是我们将长时间担任驾驶员，所以我至少应该尝试与他相处。我开始走动，但他没有和我一起进去，而是拉住我的手臂，让我停下。"等等，明日香，有些事情你必须知道。"

Then he said something that made the ground buckle and heave underneath me before vanishing into oblivion.  
然后他说了些什么，让我感觉地面在脚下扭曲起伏，随后又消失得无影无踪。

"NERV denied my request to be your guardian." His eyes grew faraway. "Your _permanent_ home is now at the apartment of Captain Katsuragi Misato."  
"NERV 拒绝了我的请求，不让我成为你的监护人。" 他的眼神变得遥远。"你现在永久居住在葛城美里上尉的公寓里。"

Author's notes: It just skipped in the series from the boat to suddenly she's living with Misato. Methinks she'd want to live with Kaji first, and only when that was denied, she would live with Misato.  
作者笔记：剧情突然从船上跳到了她突然和美里同居。我觉得她会先想和加持住在一起，只有在被拒绝后，才会选择和美里住。

Well _damn_, Asuka's such a hard character to WRITE, even in the hella easy POV of first person. There must be _some_ version of a split personality in there because her two dominant emotions are always conflicting each other. Is this why she is portrayed as a heartless bitch in most fanfictions? Yes, but it's wrong. That isn't her true character, and that isn't _anyone's_ real character. I wonder if all Asuka POV writers share my viewpoint on this. Oh well...  
该死，写明日香这个角色真难，即使在第一人称视角下也是如此简单。她内心一定有某种分裂的人格，因为她的两种主导情绪总是相互冲突。这就是为什么她在大多数同人作品中被描绘成一个无情婊子的原因吗？是的，但这是错误的。那不是她的真实性格，也不是任何人的真实性格。我想知道所有写明日香视角的作者是否都和我有同样的看法。唉，算了...

### Chapter 4

I think the rest of day one for me was a listless and halfhearted attempt at synchronization. Misato had talked to Shinji while Kaji was talking to me, so when I was led inside, I saw Shinji standing erectly next to Misato. He looked about how I felt: angry, frustrated, and tired. His eyes were averted to the ground.  
我认为第一天剩下的时间对我来说，不过是一次无精打采、半心半意的同步尝试。Misato 在和 Shinji 谈话，而 Kaji 在和我说话，所以当我被带进去时，我看到 Shinji 笔直地站在 Misato 旁边。他的样子和我感觉差不多：愤怒、沮丧和疲惫。他的目光避开了地面。

"Hey hey, I think that should do it." Kaji put an arm around my shoulders, something that I didn't know what to do with. I was furious at him for saying that to me and for acting so damn casual about it, like it was no big deal. It was a big deal to _me. Another side of me relished that touch and how even though it probably wasn't meant as a move of love, I cherished it just the same._  
“嘿嘿，我觉得应该差不多了。” 加持将一只手臂搭在我的肩上，我不知该如何应对。他对我这么说，还表现得如此漫不经心，仿佛没什么大不了的，这让我怒火中烧。对我来说，这可是件大事。但另一方面，我又享受着他的触碰，尽管这可能并非出于爱意，我依然珍视这份感觉。

_

I didn't move his arm. Instead, I looked to the ground.  
我没有挪开他的手臂，只是低头看向地面。

Misato stepped forward. "If you can't do this, then just admit it and tell me right now. I can always change the operation, even now." There was a silence in the room. She looked from me to Shinji, then back to me again. I think she was directing the question at me.  
美里向前迈了一步。“如果你做不到，那就现在承认并告诉我。我随时可以调整行动计划。” 房间里一片寂静。她从我看到真嗣，又转回来看着我。我想她是在向我提问。

I half expected Shinji to say that he wanted the First instead of me. I guess I didn't really believe that he had chosen me, and that invoked a sort of humbleness in my heart towards this boy. Sohryu Asuka Langley, feeling humble. It was a different sort of feeling, but one I didn't like. I didn't feel in control.  
我半是期待真嗣会说想要一机而不是我。我想我其实并不相信他选择了我，这让我对这个男孩心生一种谦卑。惣流·明日香·兰格雷，感到谦卑。这是一种不同的感觉，但我并不喜欢。我感觉自己失去了控制。

"No Misato, I think... I think they can do it."  
“不是的，美里，我想……我想他们能做到。”

Misato looked at Kaji reproachfully. "I don't think the question was asked of you. I want to hear it from their mouths, not yours."  
美里不满地看着加持。“我觉得这个问题不是问你的。我想听他们亲口说，而不是你代答。”

"Sorry, sorry..." He put both of his hands up in defeat. Kaji was bested before he even started.  
"对不起，对不起..." 他双手举起表示投降。还没开始，Kaji 就已经败下阵来。

Well geez. 哎呀，真是的。

"I'll do it for the sake of my Eva." I said loudly, hoping to break Shinji's silence. I wondered briefly if Misato told him of my stay here. "All of Tokyo-3 depends on me."  
"为了我的 Eva，我会做的。" 我大声说道，希望能打破真嗣的沉默。我短暂地想了一下，不知道美里是否告诉他我在这里停留的事。"整个东京-3 都依赖于我。"

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

He kept his eyes directed towards the ground. The floor must have been especially fascinating in that area. I wanted to go to a private room and change out of my garb, which were currently two towels. I feared that the towel around me would drop and that my hair was probably a tangled mess now. If I didn't brush it directly after taking a shower, it would be completely unmanageable.  
他始终盯着地面，那片地板一定特别引人入胜。我想去一个私人房间，换掉身上这身行头——两块毛巾。我担心围在身上的毛巾会掉落，而且我的头发现在肯定乱成一团。如果不洗澡后立刻梳理，它就会完全无法打理。

I came to the conclusion that this really, really sucks.  
我得出结论，这真是糟透了。

I opened my mouth to tell him to hurry up, but I felt Kaji's hand on my shoulders again. His eyes told me to be quiet. Instead, I sighed. The atmosphere wasn't right to leave the room, but atmosphere be damned. Sohryu Asuka Langley doesn't care about moments like these. I care about my hair.  
我张嘴想催他快点，但感觉到加持的手再次搭在我的肩上。他的眼神示意我安静。我叹了口气，气氛不对，不适合离开房间，但管他呢。惣流·明日香·兰格雷不在乎这种时刻。我在乎的是我的头发。

Fine! Choose Rei already and get it over with! Stop... stop leaving me in the balance.  
好吧！就选丽吧，快点结束这一切！别再...别再让我悬而未决了。

"While I won't do it for my Eva, I'll do it... to finish what I started."  
“虽然我不会为了我的 Eva 这么做，但我会...为了完成我开始的使命。”

There was silence in the room for a couple moments and nobody made a move. He chose me... again? I walked over to Shinji, towel garb and all, and didn't know whether to slap him for making me wait or congratulate him on finding a spine. The answer he gave was almost something that I would have said myself.  
房间里安静了一会儿，没有人动弹。他又一次选择了我？我走向真嗣，裹着毛巾，不知道是该因为他让我等待而扇他一巴掌，还是该恭喜他终于有了骨气。他给出的答案几乎是我自己会说的话。

"Now shake hands, both of you."  
"现在你们俩握个手吧。"

The suggestion was distasteful to me and making Shinji uncomfortable. "Why? Haven't we already reached some sort of understanding?" I whined it more than asked.  
这个提议让我感到不快，也让真嗣感到不舒服。“为什么？我们不是已经达成某种理解了吗？”我抱怨多于询问。

"Do it anyway. Asuka? Shinji?"  
"无论如何都要做。明日香？真嗣？"

I wrinkled my nose. Kaji went to Misato's side. Well, I guess I could see some of the merit involved in that. This handshake was supposed to mean a lot. I grudgingly stuck my hand out, using the other to hold up my towel. I really did feel in danger now of exposing myself. "Fine, let's get this done quickly so I can change."  
我皱了皱鼻子。加持走向美里那边。嗯，我想我能看出这其中的一些好处。这次握手意义重大。我不情愿地伸出手，用另一只手撑着毛巾。我现在真的感觉自己有暴露的危险。“好吧，让我们快点完成，这样我就可以换衣服了。”

Shinji blinked at my hand, as if unsure what to do.  
真嗣看着我的手，似乎不知道该做什么。

"Shake?" I said. "Shake. This is where you take my hand and move it up and down." I was starting to get impatient. My hair was drying quickly, dammit!  
“握手？”我说，“握手。这是你要握住我的手然后上下摇动。”我开始变得不耐烦了。我的头发干得很快，该死！

After briefly looking over my shoulder at Misato, Shinji did something that I never would have expected him to do. He walked away and left me standing there with my hand stuck out. "You go put clothes on," he said.  
在匆匆回头看了一眼美里后，真嗣做了件我从未料到他会做的事。他转身离开，留下我伸着手站在那里。“你去穿衣服，”他说。

I didn't know whether he meant it as a blow to my ego or if he really _did want me to change into suitable clothing. Either way, my pride was hurt. I felt like a moron standing there with my hand holding nothing but air. I whirled around to Kaji and pointed at Shinji setting up the test. "Did you see _that? He didn't even shake my hand! He really _is an idiot!"___  
我不知道他这话是打击我的自尊还是真的希望我换上合适的衣服。无论如何，我的自尊心都受到了伤害。我站在那里，手空空如也，感觉自己像个傻瓜。我转身向加持指着正在准备测试的真嗣。“你看到了吗？他甚至没和我握手！他真是个白痴！”

___

Kaji held his hands up. "He wants you to go change first. We don't have that much time left."  
加持举起双手。“他想让你先去换衣服。我们剩下的时间不多了。”

"What are you talking about? We've got two and a half damn days!" I was not to be placated. Did they take it the same way as I did, that his refusal to shake hands with me was a refusal to acknowledge me?  
"你在说什么？我们还有两天半的时间呢！" 我无法被安抚。他们是否和我一样理解，他拒绝与我握手，就是拒绝承认我？

I don't think so.  
我不这么认为。

"Asuka, be out here and ready in ten minutes." Misato said. "We're going to work on your synching."  
"明日香，十分钟后在这里准备好。" 美里说。"我们要练习你的同步率。"

I sighed. Not that horrid circle thing again. I trudged to the bathroom and shut the door behind me. I didn't care about the "doors open" policy just now. I needed some time to think to myself. Fortunately, no one came over and demanded that I keep the door open.  
我叹了口气。又来了，那个讨厌的圆圈游戏。我拖着脚步走向浴室，随手关上了门。此刻我并不在乎什么“门敞开”政策。我需要一些时间独自思考。幸运的是，没人过来要求我保持门开着。

_Asuka, think!  明日香，动动脑子！_

_

I still had my clothes in one hand. Setting those down on the sink, I traded for the two neural plugs. Since the door was closed and I was fairly confident that no one would try to open it, I unwrapped both towels and stood with my hair spilling over my shoulders. Misato had a full-length mirror bolted to the back of the bathroom door.  
我手里还拿着衣服。我把它们放在洗手台上，换上了两个神经插头。既然门已经关上，而且我相当确定没人会试图打开它，我便解开了两条毛巾，任由头发披散在肩上。美里在浴室门后固定了一面全身镜。

It was the only mirror in the whole damn apartment. I couldn't help but look myself over.  
这是整个该死的公寓里唯一的一面镜子。我不由自主地审视起自己来。

Such is the call of mirrors to women, we have to stand there and admire (or pick apart) our imperfections or highlights. Me... I could pick out many highlights about myself. I slid the plugs into my hair, still looking myself over. I had the perfect body of a female: thin waisted, full hips, and narrow shoulders. My breasts were large without being overbearing, and no excess fat hung anywhere.  
镜子对女性的召唤就是如此，我们不得不站在那里，欣赏（或挑剔）自己的不完美或亮点。至于我……我能找出自己许多的亮点。我将发夹滑入头发，依旧打量着自己。我拥有女性完美的身材：细腰、丰满的臀部和窄肩。我的胸部丰满而不夸张，身上也没有多余的赘肉。

But then I started seeing the imperfections, and those were more glaring. On my flat stomach I had a faint birthmark that ran from my bellybutton and two inches to the left. On my right shoulder was a jagged scar from an Eva training accident. My lips were too small and my eyes felt too big.  
但随后我开始注意到那些不完美之处，它们更加刺眼。我平坦的腹部上有一块淡淡的胎记，从肚脐向左延伸了两英寸。我的右肩上有一道锯齿状的伤疤，是 Eva 训练事故留下的。我的嘴唇太小，眼睛又显得太大。

I sighed. This bodily inventory would get me nowhere, just as it had numerous times before. I put on my undergarments first and then looked at myself in the mirror again. Maybe I hoped that they would mask my imperfections, but they didn't.  
我叹了口气。这种对身体的不满只会让我停滞不前，就像之前无数次那样。我先穿上了内衣，然后再次看向镜子中的自己。也许我希望它们能掩盖我的不完美，但它们并没有。

It would surprise people to know that the only person who thought Sohryu Asuka Langley wasn't perfect was herself.  
如果人们知道唯一一个认为惣流·明日香·兰格雷不完美的人是她自己，那一定会让他们感到惊讶。

Not wishing to continue my scrutiny, I put on those shorts and slid the blouse on top of that. They were still slightly damp and smelled faintly of shampoo. I searched around the bathroom for any semblance of a comb or brush, but I only found a toothbrush. I ran my fingers through my hair and did the best I could.  
不想继续自我审视，我穿上了那条短裤，并套上了上衣。它们还有些微湿，散发着淡淡的洗发水香味。我在浴室里四处寻找梳子或刷子，但只找到了一把牙刷。我用手梳理着头发，尽力而为。

My hair is coarse, not silky like that of other girls. Another imperfection.  
我的头发粗硬，不像其他女孩的那样柔滑。又是一个不完美之处。

"Asuka? Are you finished yet?"  
“明日香？你弄完了吗？”

I opened the door, leaving the two towels on the floor. I didn't really care to hang them up. "Yeah, I'm done."  
我打开门，任由两条毛巾留在地板上。我并不真的在意把它们挂起来。“嗯，我好了。”

Misato greeted me with a smile. She had in her arms a Rockhopper penguin, and it was quirked its head at me curiously. "Pen Pen wanted to watch your progress too." I groaned. The penguin I recognized from yesterday when the other two stooges and Hikari were there. I hoped it didn't have high expectations for us.  
美里笑着向我打招呼。她怀里抱着一只跳岩企鹅，那小家伙好奇地歪着头打量我。“Pen Pen 也想看看你的进展。”我叹了口气。这只企鹅我昨天见过，当时另外两个傻瓜和光也在场。我希望它对我们没有太高的期待。

Even if it _was a penguin._  
哪怕是只企鹅。

_

"Where's Kaji?" “加持在哪儿？”

A brief look of contempt flashed across the purple haired woman's face. She set the penguin down and it hobbled to the room where I was to be synching. "He left a minute ago and bragged about what a fine job he's done. He said that I couldn't do it without him. That idiot!"  
紫发女子脸上闪过一丝轻蔑的神情。她放下企鹅，它一瘸一拐地走向我要进行同步的房间。“他一分钟前刚走，还吹嘘自己做得多好。他说没有他我做不到。那个白痴！”

I smirked. That was Kaji for you. I wished he had stayed, but I didn't want him to see my idiot partner screw things up for both of us. I guess Misato had a little bit of common sense, he would have distracted me.  
我冷笑一声。这就是加持的作风。我倒希望他留下，但又不愿让他看到我的傻搭档把事情搞砸，连累我们俩。看来美里还有点常识，他在这儿会让我分心。

"Let's go then." “那我们走吧。”

Those three words marked the beginning of the longest and most painful Eva training I had ever gone through. Misato asked us why we weren't wearing our headphones while doing this. Shinji explained that we already figured out the secret to it and that they were useless because it was more important to concentrate. Then I added that we wouldn't be wearing headphones in our Evas, so why would we wear them here?  
那三个字标志着我有史以来经历的最漫长、最痛苦的绫波训练的开始。美里问我们为什么在做这个训练时没有戴耳机。真嗣解释说我们已经发现了其中的秘密，耳机已经没用了，因为集中注意力更为重要。然后我补充说，我们在 EVA 里也不会戴耳机，那为什么在这里要戴呢？

She looked pleased. 她看起来很满意。

I watched the clock inch from 2:00 to 3:00. And then to 4:00. 5:00. 6:00. Good thing we ate lunch right before this, or I'd be even more exhausted than I am right now. But I couldn't say that the four-hour training didn't help us a little bit. Our synch ratio got up to 53% at its highest. It would have been 55%, but Shinji missed a circle that I had.  
我看着时钟从 2 点慢慢移到 3 点，然后是 4 点，5 点，6 点。幸好我们在训练前刚吃过午饭，否则我会比现在更加筋疲力尽。但我不能否认这四个小时的训练对我们还是有点帮助的。我们的同步率最高达到了 53%。本来可以是 55%的，但真嗣错过了我画的一个圈。

I kicked him. 我踢了他一脚。

53% was 47% from perfection.  
53%意味着离完美还差 47%。

The only thing spurring me on to do this was no longer my pride and my ego; it was my desire to win. I wanted to prove both to myself and Shinji that he made the right choice in picking me. I didn't want to fail him, but most of all I didn't want to fail myself.  
驱使我继续前进的不再是我的骄傲和自尊；而是我获胜的渴望。我想向自己和真嗣证明，他选择我是正确的。我不想让他失望，但最重要的是，我不想让自己失望。

"Again." "再来一次。"

And we did the test again.  
我们又做了一次测试。

"Just one more time."  
"就再试一次。"

I think I got sick of hearing the words "just one more time" coming out of Misato's mouth. She insisted on besting our previous score, and if we didn't, we'd have to do it again automatically. When we did beat our previous score, I was the one who wanted to try it again so we could raise just one more percentage point.  
我想我是听腻了 Misato 嘴里不断蹦出的“再来一次”。她坚持要超越我们之前的记录，如果我们做不到，那就得自动重来。当我们真的打破了之前的记录时，我又想再试一次，只为再提高那么一点点百分比。

The longer I went on, the more I felt that this mission would actually work. I remember glancing at Shinji during one test. He wore an intense look of concentration and the sides of his face and arms were shining with sweat. So were mine. I think I have to take another bath.  
我越深入，就越觉得这次任务真的会成功。我记得在一次测试中瞥了一眼 Shinji。他脸上带着专注的神情，脸颊和手臂因汗水而闪闪发光。我也是。我想我得再去洗个澡。

"All right, that's enough." Misato clapped her hands while the penguin squawked and waved its flippers. I was out. I crumpled to the ground, my back unwilling to bend either way except the way which it was been accustomed to: a ninety-degree angle. The tendons in my neck felt like they were ready to snap, and my fingers were red from holding up the weight of my body at times.  
“好了，够了。”Misato 拍了拍手，企鹅则嘎嘎叫着挥动它的鳍。我出局了。我瘫倒在地，背部不愿向任何方向弯曲，除了习惯性的九十度角。我脖子上的肌腱感觉快要断了，手指也因为有时支撑着身体的重量而变得通红。

I tried to get blood back into my feet by hitting them against the ground. It hurt. I always used to make fun of people when they said that it was a "good kind of hurt", but now I think I finally understand what they meant.  
我试着通过用力跺地来恢复脚部的血液循环。这很疼。我以前总是嘲笑那些说这是“好的疼痛”的人，但现在我想我终于明白他们的意思了。

"Anyone up for round two?"  
“有人想来第二轮吗？”

Shinji and I both peeled our heads from the floor and looked up at the clock. It was 6:54. We both groaned.  
我和真嗣都从地板上抬起头，看向时钟。时间是 6 点 54 分。我们都呻吟了一声。

"Guess that's my answer."  
"看来这就是我的答案了。"

"Guess so," Shinji replied weakly.  
""应该是吧，"" 真嗣无力地回答。

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Misato stride over to the door. I envied the bounce in her step and wished that I had that kind of energy now. "You guys have a half hour to eat and get ready for bed. Then at 7:30, I want you back on the balcony."  
我用眼角余光看到美里大步走向门口。我羡慕她那轻快的步伐，希望自己现在也能有那样的活力。""你们有半小时吃饭和准备睡觉。然后 7 点 30 分，我要你们回到阳台上。"

"What for?" I asked. The balcony? Jumping off sounded like a feasible option.  
“为什么？”我问道。阳台？跳下去听起来是个可行的选择。

She flashed us a victory sign. "I want you two out there. Alone for an hour. I don't care what you talk about, you don't even have to talk about anything. As long as you're on the same bench, I don't care what you do."  
她向我们比了个胜利的手势。“我要你们两个出去，单独待一个小时。我不在乎你们聊什么，甚至可以什么都不聊。只要你们坐在同一张长椅上，我不在乎你们做什么。”

I sat up and looked at her as if she'd lost her mind. Synch training was okay, but an hour of nothing? Another waste of time? "I think one more hour of this test would help us a hell of a lot more than sitting around and doing nothing."  
我坐起身，看着她，仿佛她已经失去了理智。同步训练还可以，但一个小时什么都不做？又是在浪费时间吗？“我觉得再做一个小时的测试对我们帮助会大得多，而不是坐在这里无所事事。”

That statement got my feet and my neck screaming in protest.  
那句话让我脚和脖子都痛苦地抗议起来。

Pen Pen walked out the door, but Misato stayed behind for a moment longer. "That may be so, but you won't get any better if you don't understand the other person. You guys can play catch up." She winked and closed the door behind her. "Good luck!" she called from the hallway.  
Pen Pen 走出门去，但美里多留了一会儿。“或许如此，但如果你不了解对方，你就不会有所进步。你们可以慢慢来。”她眨了眨眼，关上了门。“祝你们好运！”她在走廊里喊道。

Neither of us knew what to say. "How come you didn't say anything?" I demanded of Shinji. "I _know you don't want to waste your time like I do."_  
我们俩都不知道该说什么。“你为什么什么都没说？”我质问真嗣。“我知道你不想像我那样浪费时间。”

_

Shinji was still lying down on the ground. "I don't like wasting my time, but I don't want to do this test again either."  
真嗣还躺在地上。“我不喜欢浪费时间，但也不想再做这个测试了。”

"That makes two of us."  
“我们俩想法一致。”

Without much of an argument, I said I'd take a shower again. Even though he was less than pleased about having to stay that much longer in sweaty clothes, he had not choice but to comply. We brushed our teeth and a squabble over whose toothpaste was more superior broke out. I said my teeth were whiter than his. He disagreed.  
没怎么争论，我就说我要再去洗个澡。尽管他不太高兴得穿着汗湿的衣服多待一会儿，但他别无选择只能服从。我们刷了牙，还为谁的牙膏更好而吵了起来。我说我的牙齿比他的更白。他不同意。

Anyways, then we watched T.V. I didn't want to watch his stupid "Symponic Orchestra" marathon, so I grabbed the remote and changed the channel to a wrestling match. To my surprise, he had a remote as well and flipped the channel back. I swear, Misato bought two remotes just for that very purpose.  
反正，后来我们就看电视了。我才不想看他那无聊的“交响乐团”马拉松，于是我抢过遥控器换到了摔跤比赛。出乎意料的是，他也有个遥控器，又把频道切了回去。我敢打赌，美里买两个遥控器就是为了这个目的。

"No, I don't want to watch that, it's stupid!"  
“不，我不想看那个，太蠢了！”

"I don't want to watch two guys doing _that."_  
“我不想看两个男人那样。”

_

"Are you a man? Watch wrestling!" I shot back..  
“你是男人吗？看摔跤去！”我回呛道。

"Are you a woman? Watch the orchestra!" He wrapped up my words and gave me a bullet through the heart.  
“你是女人吗？听交响乐去！”他总结了我的话，一击直中我心。

I threw the remote down and said I was hungry. He said he was hungry too. I didn't have long to gloat over my victory that we finally agreed on something. The time was 7:21 and we didn't have enough time to cook a full course dinner. Shinji got a bowl of cereal while I opted for some instant ramen. Hot and spicy, of course.  
我把遥控器一扔，说饿了。他说他也饿了。我还没来得及为我们的共识得意太久，时间已是 7 点 21 分，我们没时间做一顿正餐了。真嗣拿了碗麦片，而我选择了方便面，当然是辣味的。

After I eagerly gobbled down my ramen, when the clock hit 7:30, I was already outside. I lay down on the bench, hoping I could take up all the room. Unfortunately, there was always a little bit of extra space on the end. After staring at the sky for a minute, Shinji finally came out. He was still eating his cereal.  
我狼吞虎咽地吃完拉面后，当钟敲响 7:30 时，我已经站在外面了。我躺在长椅上，希望自己能占满所有空间。不幸的是，椅子尽头总还剩一点空隙。盯着天空发了一会儿呆，真嗣终于出来了。他还在吃着麦片。

"Geez, isn't that soggy yet?" He must have been a really slow eater.  
“天哪，还没泡软吗？”他肯定是个吃得特别慢的人。

"This is my second bowl." He sat down beside my head with me still lying level to the ground. I was about to tell him to get the hell to the other side, but I caught myself. Kaji's words about staying here for a long, long time repeated themselves.  
“这是我的第二碗。”他在我头旁边坐下，而我依然平躺在地上。我正要叫他滚到另一边去，却及时打住了。加持关于要在这里待很久很久的话再次回响在耳边。

"So..." Since Shinji was busy eating his cereal, I felt like I had to be the one to start a conversation. I wished I had something in my mouth too so I didn't have to do this. I only talk when I want to, and right now, I didn't feel like talking. I said nothing else.  
"那么..." 既然真嗣正忙着吃他的麦片，我觉得我得是那个开启对话的人。我希望我嘴里也有点什么，这样我就不用这么做了。我只在我愿意的时候说话，而现在，我并不想说话。我没再说什么。

I just looked at the sky.  
我只是看着天空。

It was sort of cool outside, but that was only when the chill evening breeze blew. I felt like a storm was coming soon.  
外面有点凉，但那只是在傍晚的寒风刮起时。我感觉暴风雨可能很快就要来了。

"The stars aren't out tonight."  
"今晚星星也不出来。"

I couldn't think of a snappy comeback to that one, so instead I stayed quiet. I was looking straight at it. There was no moon either. I think it was hiding behind a thick blanket of dark clouds. "The moon isn't out either."  
我想不出什么机智的反驳，于是选择了沉默。我直视着天空，月亮也不见踪影。我想它大概是躲在厚厚的乌云后面了。""月亮也不出来。""

"No." He put his cereal bowl down on the ground, and I heard spoon clatter against the side of the ceramic.  
"没有。"他把麦片碗放在地上，我听到勺子碰在陶瓷碗边的声音。

That was the extent of our conversation for the next fifteen minutes. We didn't say anything else. I mean, what in the world could I say? I was somewhat afraid to speak, because something bad and derogatory might come out of my mouth. Normally, it did, but I didn't want to push my luck anymore with this boy until I found out more about him.  
接下来的十五分钟里，我们的对话就到此为止了。我们没有再说什么。我的意思是，我还能说什么呢？我有些害怕开口，因为可能会说出什么糟糕或贬低的话。通常情况下，我确实会这样，但我不愿意再在这个男孩身上冒险，直到我对他了解更多。

I used to think that he was the perfect whetstone, but now I wasn't so sure anymore. Underneath that calm exterior, there was something always boiling, something always waiting. Waiting to explode.  
我曾以为他是完美的磨刀石，但现在我不那么确定了。在那平静的外表下，总有什么东西在沸腾，总有什么东西在等待。等待爆发。

We were kindred souls in that, I guess.  
在这点上，我想我们是灵魂伴侣。

I noted there weren't even any sounds. There was the occasional car that would roar down the street and the rare shout of a mother calling her child in, but other than that, no other noise except for his breathing and mine. There weren't even any cicadas out.  
我注意到这里甚至连声音都没有。偶尔会有汽车轰鸣着驶过街道，或是稀疏传来母亲呼唤孩子回家的喊声，但除此之外，除了他的呼吸声和我的，再无其他声响。甚至连蝉鸣都没有。

I'm very dangerous when exposed to long periods of silence. I had to say something, even it was just for the sake of breaking up the monotony. "Hey Shinji..."  
长时间处于沉默中，我会变得非常危险。我必须说些什么，哪怕只是为了打破这种单调。“嘿，真嗣……”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

He sounded tired. "Why don't you have any crickets or things like that here?"  
他的声音听起来很疲惫。“为什么这里没有蟋蟀之类的昆虫呢？”

It was a stupid question, but it was something.  
这是个愚蠢的问题，但总比没有好。

He thought about his. Shinji drew his knees up to his chest and put his arms around them. "I don't know."  
他想着自己的。真嗣将膝盖蜷缩到胸前，双臂环绕着它们。“我不知道。”

"You don't know?" I snorted. "You've lived here longer than I have and you don't know?"  
“你不知道？”我嗤之以鼻。“你住在这里的时间比我长，你居然不知道？”

Shinji didn't say anything and once more subjected me to the silence. "I never really paid much attention to things like that." He turned his head and looked down at me. "Do you?"  
真嗣什么也没说，再次让我陷入了沉默。“我从未真正关注过这类事情。”他转过头，低头看着我。“你呢？”

I put my arms behind my head. "Not really, I just wanted to know why it's so damn quiet around here."  
我将双臂枕在脑后。“其实也没什么，我只是想知道为什么这里这么他妈的安静。”

I could see him smile. "Maybe that's because you're not talking."  
我能看到他在微笑。“也许是因为你没在说话。”

"Watch it, Third." He was laughing a little bit, but I couldn't help myself from smiling. I sneered, "At least it's better than not talking at _all like you do."_  
“小心点，老三。”他笑了一点点，但我忍不住也笑了。我嘲讽道：“至少比像你那样一句话都不说要好。”

_

"I like the quiet."  
“我喜欢安静。”

"I noticed." “我注意到了。”

"It helps me think about things. I'm used to it," he explained.  
"这有助于我思考事情。我习惯了，" 他解释道。

That was totally opposite from me. Life as I remember back then was full of hustle and bustle. The only way I felt comfortable was when there was a lot of noise. When I was selected to be an Eva pilot, they sent me over to Germany for training. Then I went to college in America before going back to Germany for more training.  
那完全与我相反。我记忆中的生活充满了忙碌和喧嚣。唯一让我感到舒适的时候就是有很多噪音。当我被选中成为 Eva 驾驶员时，他们送我到德国接受训练。然后我在美国上大学，之后又回到德国继续训练。

_When I was selected to be an Eva pilot, my mother—  
当我被选中成为 Eva 驾驶员时，我的母亲——_

_

Shinji interrupted my line of thought, making me nearly jump out of my skin. "What are you thinking about?"  
真嗣打断了我的思绪，吓得我差点跳起来。“你在想什么呢？”

I didn't want to go down that path. "I'll have you know that my thoughts are worth a lot more than a penny, Ikari Shinji." I sat up and narrowed my eyes playfully at him. "But for yours... maybe a penny is too much."  
我不想走那条路。“我得告诉你，我的想法可不止一文不值，碇真嗣。”我坐起身，调皮地眯起眼睛看他。“但你的嘛……或许一文钱都嫌多。”

He looked annoyed. "Don't say such awful things about me."  
他看起来有些恼火。“别这么说我坏话。”

Another silence. Suddenly I became aware of how closely we were sitting. In Germany, they told me that the respectable distance that Japanese liked to sit was about twice of what I would normally allow. I was sitting the way I would next to a German. I scooted a little further away, and Shinji looked at me, confused.  
又是一阵沉默。突然间，我意识到我们坐得有多近。在德国时，他们告诉我日本人认为得体的距离大约是我通常允许的两倍。我现在的坐姿就像坐在一个德国人旁边一样。我稍微挪远了一点，而真嗣看着我，一脸困惑。

"You smell," was my excuse. Of course, I delivered this with a smile so that he wouldn't take it the wrong way. Time for another test: the test of humor.  
“你身上有味道，”我找了个借口。当然，我带着微笑说这话，以免他误会。是时候进行另一个测试了：幽默感的测试。

Shinji still took it the wrong way. "But I just took a shower."  
真嗣还是误会了。“但我刚洗过澡。”

I exhaled sharply. "I didn't say you smelled bad, I just said you smelled!" Why were Japanese people so damn uptight? I don't remember it being this bad when I left.  
"我猛地呼出一口气。“我没说你臭，只是说你有味道！”为什么日本人就这么死板呢？我记得我离开时没这么严重啊。”

A motorcycle careened down the street.  
一辆摩托车在街上疾驰而过。

"So you're saying I smell good?"  
“所以你是说我闻起来不错？”

I caught a hint of slyness in that question, but it was gone so quickly that I wondered if it even existed in the first place. What to say to that? I didn't anticipate this. Instead, I changed the subject. "Looks like I'm going to be living with you guys from now on."  
那问题中掠过一丝狡黠，但转瞬即逝，让我怀疑它是否真的存在过。该如何回应呢？我未曾预料到这一幕。于是，我转移了话题。“看来从今往后，我得和你们一起生活了。”

"I know." He looked down at his hands. Disappointment that he couldn't be rid of me? Happiness that I was staying? I couldn't tell. "Misato told me."  
“我知道。”他低头看着自己的手。是因为无法摆脱我而失望？还是因为我留下而高兴？我无从分辨。“美里告诉我的。”

That decision still made me angry. I as an Eva pilot was one of the most important people there. I should be able to get a choice of who I get to stay with. The only thing that comforted me was that I was _sure that Kaji argued with them for as long as he could on that issue. "Yeah, it sucks. I'd much rather live with Kaji."_  
这个决定仍让我感到愤怒。作为 EVA 驾驶员，我是那里最重要的人物之一。我理应有权选择与谁同住。唯一能安慰我的，是我确信加持在那件事上与他们争论了很久。“是啊，真糟糕。我宁愿和加持一起住。”

_

Shinji paused. "Misato said that too."  
真嗣停顿了一下。“美里也这么说过。”

I peered at his face. "What else did she say?"  
我盯着他的脸。“她还说了什么？”

"Nothing I didn't already know."  
“没什么我不知道的。”

I didn't let that stop me. "Did she say anything about Kaji and I?"  
我并没有因此而止步。“她有没有提到我和加持？”

He paused again. "Not really. She just tried to convince me to keep going with this mission. With you."  
他又顿了顿。“其实没有。她只是试图说服我继续执行这个任务。和你一起。”

"Of course, that's because I'm the best."  
“当然，那是因为我是最棒的。”

The silence that followed that comment was welcome. I needed time to sort things out in my head. Did Misato really say that he should continue with me? Or was he just saying that to keep my esteem up? I didn't care either way, because it was me who was here now, not Rei. She _must have said something about Kaji and me if she talked of me staying here with them._  
那句话之后的沉默让人感到舒适。我需要时间在脑海中整理一切。Misato 真的说他应该和我继续下去吗？还是他只是为了保持我的自尊心才这么说的？我不在乎这些，因为现在在这里的是我，不是 Rei。如果她谈到我和 Kaji，她一定说了些什么，让我留在这里和他们在一起。

_

"When are you going to unpack your things?"  
“你打算什么时候拆开行李？”

I sighed. There was no escape. "I guess tomorrow. We don't really have anything else to do..."  
我叹了口气。无处可逃。“我想是明天吧。我们确实没有其他事情可做……”

"... and I don't want to do those tests until I have to..." His voice turned skeptical. "You mean you're going to let me help you?"  
"... 而且我不想在没有必要之前就做那些测试..." 他的声音变得怀疑起来。"你是说你会让我帮你？"

"Of course!" I exclaimed. Did he think for one second he'd be able to weasel his way out of this? Hauling boxes back and forth from the living room to my designated room was _his job. Then I realized that he meant it in a different way, like I would refuse to have him help me. "Yeah, you can help me. Better to put you to work than doing nothing. Plus, maybe it'll help with synchronization... or something."_  
"当然！" 我大声说道。难道他以为自己能轻易逃避这份差事吗？从客厅来回搬运箱子到我指定的房间是他的任务。随后我意识到他指的是另一种方式，好像我会拒绝让他帮忙似的。"是的，你可以帮我。让你干活总比无所事事强。而且，也许这能帮助同步...或者其他什么。"

_

Shinji looked content with the answer. Maybe he didn't mind being worked like a mule. Or maybe he just didn't know what he was going to do. "Fine. I'll do it."  
真嗣对这个回答似乎感到满意。也许他并不介意像头驴一样被使唤。或者他只是不知道自己该做什么。"好吧。我会做的。"

"You don't have a choice," I informed him arrogantly. The wind started to grow a little stronger, and I felt something wet hit the back of my neck. "By the way, I think it's going to rain."  
"你别无选择，" 我傲慢地告诉他。风开始变得更强了，我感觉有什么湿湿的东西打在了我的后颈上。"顺便说一句，我觉得要下雨了。"

"I think you're right."  
"我想你说得对。"

"Of course I am."  
"当然准备好了。"

We had to cut our quiet time by about 20 minutes. I ushered Shinji inside just as the heavens unleashed a torrent of rain. Shinji wanted to go back outside because he left his cereal bowl on the bench. I said that the damn cereal bowl was still going to be there when the storm stopped, so he should just calm down. He countered that maybe the wind was strong enough to blow it away. I commented that at least we wouldn't have to wash it if that happened.  
我们不得不缩短了大约 20 分钟的安静时光。就在老天爷倾盆大雨之际，我催促真嗣进屋。真嗣想回到外面，因为他把他的麦片碗落在了长椅上。我说那该死的麦片碗等暴风雨停了还在那儿，所以他应该冷静下来。他反驳说也许风大到足以把它吹走。我打趣道，如果那样的话，至少我们就不用洗碗了。

He didn't go back outside.  
他没有再回到外面去。

After I had rolled my futon out and was unfolding my blanket, I made a general comment about how unbelievable it is that Japanese sleep on the floor. The rain must have stopped, I could no longer hear it pelting against the roof. Japan had really odd weather swings.  
在我铺好被褥并展开毯子后，我随口提了一句日本人睡在地板上真是不可思议。雨似乎停了，我再也听不到雨点敲打屋顶的声音。日本的天气真是变化莫测。

"Did Kaji also tell you about our sleeping arrangement?"  
“加治也告诉你我们的睡铺安排了吗？”

I stopped unfolding and stared at him. He was in the safety of his room, sitting up on his bed. "What?"  
我停下了展开的动作，盯着他。他正安全地待在自己的房间里，坐在床上。“什么？”

"Misato said that tomorrow night we'd be... um... sleeping in the same room."  
“美里说，明晚我们要……呃……睡在同一个房间。”

I growled. With the door to Shinji's room open and me sleeping within sight of him, what did Misato count as the same room?  
我低吼了一声。既然通往真嗣房间的门开着，而我又能看到他睡觉，那美里所谓的同一个房间到底是什么意思？

Can't the woman give me just one good night's rest? I was exhausted from today and wanted to curl up in my blanket and never come out. My eyelids felt like leaden weights and begged to close over my dry eyeballs. They'd been open so long I was afraid my eyes would dry out. "Your door's open. I can see you. We're sleeping in the same damned room."  
难道这女人就不能让我好好睡一晚吗？我今天累坏了，只想蜷缩在毯子里不出来。我的眼皮沉重如铅，渴望合上我干涩的眼球。它们已经睁得太久，我担心眼睛会干涸。“你的门开着。我能看见你。我们睡在同一个该死的房间里。”

"No... I mean..." He was pausing. Oh no, this had to be bad. "In the same room as in right next to each other."  
“不……我是说……”他停顿了。哦不，这肯定不妙。“在同一个房间，就是紧挨着的意思。”

I suddenly didn't feel so tired anymore.  
我突然就不觉得那么困了。

Author's notes: Yes, if you rewatch the episode "Both of you, dance like you want to win!" again, you will note that when Asuka kicks Shinji, neither of them are wearing headphones. Thus, my chapter has no headphones.  
作者的话：没错，如果你重新观看剧集《你们俩，跳舞吧，像是要赢一样！》，你会发现当明日香踢真嗣时，他们俩都没戴耳机。因此，我的章节里没有耳机。

I'm a stickler for detail, what can I say.  
我对细节很执着，我还能说什么呢。

### Chapter 5

**2 days until D-Day.  距离 D-Day 还有 2 天。**

**

I didn't get a wink of sleep. Too busy plotting all the ways to disembowel Misato. I mean, I understand that synchronization this, I got that. Yes, sleep makes up for nearly one third of our time here together, so sleeping in the same room is instrumental to understanding that person's patterns.  
我一夜未眠。满脑子都是如何将美里开膛破肚的计划。我是说，我明白同步率这回事，我懂的。是的，睡眠几乎占据了我们共同时间的三分之一，所以睡在同一个房间对于理解那个人的习惯至关重要。

_Okay, I was with her so far.  
好吧，到目前为止我还跟得上她的思路。_

_

Wait a minute... didn't she say that politics were involved? Isn't it some kind of abuse or sexual crime to force two people to share the same room together? That really didn't bother me as much as I made it out to be, but since Misato insisted that we wouldn't do that, then I convinced myself that I didn't have to worry about it.  
等一下...她不是说这事牵扯到政治吗？强迫两个人共处一室，不算是某种虐待或性犯罪吗？其实这并没有我想象中那么困扰我，但既然美里坚持说我们不会那样做，我就说服自己不必为此担心。

_Was I wrong!  我错了吗！_

_

I hate being thrown into situations that I didn't have any planning for. Misato knew that. If she had told me earlier than now I wouldn't be so mad, because that way I would have some semblance of a plan.  
我讨厌被突然扔进毫无准备的局面。美里知道这一点。如果她早点告诉我，我就不会这么生气了，因为那样我至少还能有个大致的计划。

I think I slept on and off during the night. But strangely enough, when I woke up in the morning I didn't feel tired. Maybe I was running on my energy reserves. I'm reputed to be a late sleeper, but as soon as I saw morning's first light, I knew I couldn't go back to sleep.  
我想我夜里断断续续地睡了一会儿。但奇怪的是，早上醒来时我并不觉得累。也许我是在消耗能量储备。我以晚睡著称，但一看到晨曦初露，我就知道无法再入睡了。

Might as well get up.  
还是起床吧。

I looked at the time. 6:27. I cursed Misato to nine hells. It was her fault for making me get up this early. After rolling up my futon and folding my blanket, I plopped down on the couch and tried to calm my beastlike hair. No sooner as I started combing it with my fingers, Shinji stirred in his bed.  
我看了看时间。6:27。我诅咒美里下九层地狱。都是她的错，让我这么早起床。卷起被褥，叠好毯子后，我一屁股坐在沙发上，试图平复我那野兽般的头发。我刚用手指开始梳理，真嗣就在床上动了动。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

He didn't answer. Must still be asleep. I gave a once over to the mountain of boxes that littered the apartment before turning my attention back inside the room of the Third Child. From where I was sitting, I couldn't really see much except a white mound.  
他没有回答。一定还在睡。我快速扫视了一遍散落满屋的箱子堆，然后又将注意力转回第三适格者的房间。从我坐的地方，除了一个白色的小山丘，其他什么也看不清。

_Sleeping peacefully.  安详地睡着。_

_

The thought was both a statement and evil at the same time. It was another half an hour until he had to wake up, but I wanted to have a little bit of fun. Was it always this craving for embarrassment that made me want to start all days off? Besides, it's not like I would hurt him or anything, just wake him up early. And also, he should know that my sense of humor would be important to understand if we were to synchronize.  
这个念头既是陈述也是邪恶的，同时存在。还有半小时他才需要醒来，但我想要找点乐子。难道总是这种对尴尬的渴望让我想以这种方式开始每一天吗？再说了，我又不会伤害他，只是提前叫醒他而已。而且，如果我们要同步，他应该理解我的幽默感有多重要。

Show him what Sohryu Asuka Langley was all about.  
让他见识一下，什么是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

I slid the neural plugs in my hair and walked casually to his door. I looked around once before stepping inside. I had never been inside his room before, and it was an odd feeling. The walls were strangely bare, with no belongings or anything. I wrinkled my nose in distaste. He was one lousy interior decorator.  
我将神经插头滑入头发，随意走向他的房门。进去前我环顾了一下四周。我从未进过他的房间，这种感觉很奇怪。墙壁异常空旷，没有任何私人物品。我皱了皱鼻子，表示不满。他真是个糟糕的室内装饰者。

It was as bare as a cheap motel room.  
简陋得像廉价汽车旅馆的房间。

The only thing that would make me believe there was a person living here was his closet. It was open, and inside hung a myriad of pressed white shirts, arranged neatly from which was the biggest to the smallest. On the other side were ironed black slacks in a row.  
唯一让我相信这里住着人的是他那衣柜。衣柜门开着，里面挂满了熨烫平整的白衬衫，从大到小整齐排列。另一边则是熨好的黑色西裤，一排排挂着。

_Geez, talk about boring.  天啊，真是无聊透顶。_

_

There was a section behind the shirts that had all the clothes he accumulated that I'm guessing he never wore. I didn't want to even _look at those._  
衬衫后面有一块区域，堆满了他积攒的衣服，我猜他可能从未穿过。我甚至不想看那些。

_

I looked around the room again. A small dresser at the head of his bed caught my eye. On top, there were two SDAT players. One I recognized as the one that we were told to use, and the other was an older model. There was a tape inside, but I didn't want to open the case for fear of waking him up. Probably some boring symphony tape.  
我又环顾了一下房间。床头的小衣柜引起了我的注意。上面放着两个 SDAT 播放器。其中一个是我们被告知要用的，另一个是旧型号。里面有一盘磁带，但我不想打开盖子，怕吵醒他。可能是些无聊的交响乐磁带。

Finally, I looked at Shinji.  
最后，我看向真嗣。

He was sleeping with his face to the wall. He didn't snore. I breathed a prayer of thanks. Tonight was going to be miserable for me (and for _him) if he did snore. He had his covers pressed to his chin; it reminded me of a little kid._  
他面朝墙壁睡着，没有打鼾。我松了一口气，感谢上苍。如果他打鼾，今晚对我（和他）来说都会很痛苦。他把被子拉到下巴，让我想起了小孩子。

_

_Once you take a good look at him, he is sort of cute...  
一旦你仔细打量他，他其实还挺可爱的……_

_

I dismissed that thought as quickly as it came with another one.  
我迅速抛开了这个念头，转而想到了另一个。

_Yeah, if you ignore the weak will and the perverseness...  
是啊，如果你忽略掉那脆弱的意志和变态的一面……_

_

It was probably an effect of not seeing anyone else except Kaji and Misato during these two days. Anything that moved looked cute to me. I scolded myself for having set my standards too low this time.  
这两日除了加持和美里，我几乎没见过其他人，大概是这个原因吧。任何会动的东西在我眼里都显得可爱。我责备自己这次标准定得太低了。

I guess I couldn't tell you what came over me when I watched Shinji sleeping. A part of me was repulsed that I'd even think about such a possibility, but the other part was just content to watch him breath. I told myself that he earned his rest last night, he actually met my expectations during the test.  
我猜当我看着真嗣睡觉时，自己也不明白是什么感觉。一部分的我反感自己竟然会考虑这种可能性，但另一部分的我只是满足于看着他呼吸。我告诉自己，他昨晚确实努力了，在测试中达到了我的期望。

_Let him sleep, my inner voice said.  
让他睡吧，我内心的声音说。_

_

Too bad I never listened to my inner voice.  
可惜我从未听从内心的声音。

Grabbing his sheet, I yanked it off his body and sang, "Get up, little Shinji! Time to make Asuka breakfast!" People have to understand that there's spontaneity in me that has to be fed. If I don't get my dose of the unusual, I get very cranky. That's also linked to my power needy self, but we won't get into that now.  
我一把扯过他的床单，从他身上拽下来，唱道：“起床了，小真嗣！该给明日香做早餐了！”人们得明白，我体内有股自发性需要被满足。如果得不到那份不寻常的刺激，我会变得非常暴躁。这也与我那渴望权力的自我有关，但我们现在不谈这个。

He groaned, rolled over and rubbed his eyes. Once his eyes focused on the clock, he looked up at me and waved his hand. "It's only 6:50. I still have ten minutes to sleep... so leave me alone..."  
他呻吟着，翻了个身，揉了揉眼睛。当他的视线聚焦在闹钟上时，抬头看了我一眼，挥了挥手。“才 6 点 50 分。我还能再睡十分钟……所以别烦我……”

"But I'm hungry now!" I whined. I wanted to be as annoying as I could. If he didn't think it was possible, I just did it. I took to laying my hand on his shoulder and rocking him back and forth in his bed. "Please? Please? I'm hungry..."  
“但我现在饿了！”我抱怨道。我想尽可能地烦他。如果他认为不可能，那我就做到了。我开始把手放在他的肩膀上，在他的床上前后摇晃他。“求你了？求你了？我饿了……”

"No... let me sleep. I let you sleep yesterday..."  
“不行……让我睡觉。我昨天让你睡了……”

I dropped his sheet to the floor and rocked him with both hands. So let him treasure the moment. It'll be the only time I'd ever have my hands on him. I turned on my sexy voice and guessed he'd be up in two seconds. "But I'm really, _really hungry..."_  
我将他的床单扔到地板上，双手摇晃着他。就让他珍惜这一刻吧。这将是我唯一一次有机会触碰他。我切换到性感的嗓音，猜想他两秒内就会醒来。“但我真的，真的饿了……”

_

I wish I had a camera to capture that moment. His eyes shot open as if set off by rockets and his face was drenched in red. He stared up at me with his hands drawn up to his face. The sacrificial lamb picture came to mind. "F-Fine."  
真希望我有相机能捕捉到那个瞬间。他的眼睛像被火箭点燃般猛地睁开，满脸通红。他双手捂着脸，抬头盯着我。我想起了那幅牺牲羔羊的画面。“好——好吧。”

"That's much better, little Shinji." I hummed as I swaggered out of the room, knowing he was watching my every move. I had so much power to manipulate men it almost frightened me. Almost. "And no hashbrowns either. I hate those things."  
“这样好多了，小真嗣。”我哼着歌，大摇大摆地走出房间，知道他在注视着我的一举一动。我有如此多的手段操控男人，这几乎让我自己都感到害怕。几乎。“而且也不要薯饼。我讨厌那些东西。”

I was waiting at the table calmly when Shinji marched into the room. His hair wasn't as perfect as yesterday's, but not bad considering he just got up. Why was he in such a rush, anyways? I said I wanted a German breakfast and that I was sick of eating noodles first thing in the morning. He said that he didn't know how to make it.  
我平静地坐在桌旁等待，这时真嗣快步走进房间。他的头发没有昨天那么完美，但考虑到他刚起床，已经算不错了。话说回来，他这么匆忙干嘛？我说我想吃德式早餐，已经厌倦了早上第一件事就是吃面条。他回答说他不知道怎么做。

I sighed. He sure was ignorant.  
我叹了口气。他确实是无知。

I showed him how to make pancakes, but not before exploding the flour bag while trying to open it. It wasn't my fault that those damn flour bags are so hard to tear...  
我教他如何做煎饼，但在试图打开面粉袋时先把袋子炸开了。那些该死的面粉袋那么难撕开，这可不是我的错……

I said I wanted blueberry pancakes. He said they didn't have blueberries.  
我说我要蓝莓煎饼。他说他们没有蓝莓。

Strawberries? No.  草莓？不。

Chocolate chips? 巧克力碎片？

"You eat chocolate first thing in the morning?" The very thought was distasteful to him.  
“你一大早先吃巧克力？”光是这个想法就让他觉得反感。

I said it was like a tradition in Germany. He shook his head, no doubt wondering about my sanity, but got a bag of chocolate morsels all the same. Almost half an hour later, we were eating perfectly cooked pancakes made by yours truly. Shinji actually said they were pretty good. I beamed with pride. I saved an extra plate for Misato, but she didn't come down to breakfast. I didn't see her for the rest of the morning either.  
我说这在德国就像个传统。他摇了摇头，无疑在怀疑我的理智，但还是拿了一袋巧克力碎片。差不多半小时后，我们吃上了我亲手做的完美煎饼。真嗣居然说它们挺不错。我自豪地笑了。我还给美里留了一盘，但她没下来吃早餐。整个上午我也没见到她。

I ate her pancakes.  
我吃了她的煎饼。

"What do we do now?" I asked through a mouthful of pancake.  
“我们现在怎么办？”我嘴里塞满煎饼问道。

Shinji looked at me. "What about unpacking your things? Since you're going to be staying with us, you—"  
真嗣看着我。“你的行李还没拆呢？既然你要和我们住在一起，你——”

I held up my hand, this was my last bite and I wanted to relish it. After I had finished thoroughly chewing and swallowing it, I said, "Yeah, we should do that."  
我举起手，这是我最后一口，我想好好享受。等我彻底咀嚼并咽下后，我说：“是啊，我们确实该整理一下。”

I've explored this apartment from top to bottom, and there's only one possible place where they can expect to fit me. I took a hunch that Misato wanted me to stay in the guest bedroom, and if I was wrong, I still wouldn't move. I was not going to sleep on the couch or some futon on the floor. "You can start by taking those three boxes to this room." I ordered Shinji.  
我已经把这个公寓从上到下探了个遍，只有一处可能容纳我的地方。我猜 Misato 是想让我住在客房，如果我猜错了，我也不会搬。我可不打算睡沙发或是地板上的蒲团。“你先把那三个箱子搬到这个房间。”我命令 Shinji。

I stepped into the guest bedroom; it looked exactly like Shinji's room, minus clothes and two SDAT players. It had a scent of a new coat of paint. There were plenty of drawers to put all my clothes, but not many shelves. When I was inspecting the inadequate closet space, Shinji came in with three boxes and set them on the floor.  
我走进客房，它看起来和 Shinji 的房间一模一样，只是少了衣服和两台 SDAT 播放器。房间里弥漫着新刷油漆的味道。有很多抽屉可以放我的衣服，但架子不多。当我检查着不足的衣柜空间时，Shinji 带着三个箱子进来了，把它们放在地上。

"I'll just put these here, okay?"  
“我就放这儿了，可以吗？”

"Fine." “好吧。”

He left to get more, and kept bringing back box after box. Not once did he complain about his rotten luck helping me. I know for a _fact some of those were very heavy. That moved the respect up a couple of notches. Once the room was full of boxes, there was hardly any room to maneuver. I told him to stop. "We have to have a place to _walk."__  
他去拿更多的箱子，一箱接一箱地搬回来。他一次也没有抱怨过帮我搬东西的倒霉运气。我知道其中一些箱子非常重。这让我对他的尊敬又增加了几分。当房间里堆满了箱子，几乎没有什么空间可以移动时，我告诉他停下来。“我们得有地方走路。”

__

"Oh, right." "哦，对了。"

Shinji just stood there in the doorway, not sure of what to do. I didn't want him to go and I didn't want him to stay at the same time. I knew this would be a giant pain, I'd already done it once before in college. It would be great to have a helping hand.  
真嗣就站在门口，不知所措。我不希望他离开，同时也不希望他留下。我知道这会是个大麻烦，我在大学时已经经历过一次。有个人帮忙会很好。

"All right Shinji. I'm giving you the honor of being able to see my things." I pulled a strip of packing tape off a box and crumpled it into a sticky ball. "You can help me unpack."  
"好吧，真嗣。我给你这个荣幸，让你看看我的东西。" 我从一个箱子上撕下一条胶带，揉成一个黏黏的小球。"你可以帮我拆箱。"

Shinji hesitated. "Are you sure?"  
真嗣犹豫了一下。“你确定吗？”

"When am I ever not sure?" I threw the tape ball at him and it stuck to his shirt. He brushed it off and it tumbled onto the floor. "Besides, it'll help you to get to know me." He didn't respond. "Not in _that way, you pervert."_  
“我什么时候不确定过？”我把胶带球扔向他，它粘在了他的衬衫上。他拍掉它，球滚落到地板上。“再说，这能帮你更好地了解我。”他没有回应。“不是你想的那种方式，你这个变态。”

_

"I wasn't thinking about it that way."  
“我并没有那样想。”

"Obviously you were, or else you wouldn't have known what I was talking about!"  
“显然你是知道的，不然你怎么会明白我在说什么！”

Shinji maneuvered around the boxes and made it to the bed, the only box less place in the room. I said I'd open the boxes and hand him the things, and he would put them in the correct places.  
真嗣绕过箱子，来到了床上，这是房间里唯一没有被箱子占据的地方。我说过我会打开箱子，把东西递给他，然后他会把它们放在正确的位置。

_Maybe this will help his decorating skills.  
也许这能提升他的装饰技巧。_

_

The first two boxes had nothing but dresses. We hung them on hangers that were left over in the closets; me doing the hangar work and Shinji arranging them in the closet. By color. I was meticulous like that. "This one's sort of pretty." Shinji held up a dress that I hadn't worn in two years. It was green with a garish bow in the front.  
前两个箱子里全是裙子。我们把它们挂在衣柜里剩下的衣架上；我负责挂衣服，而真嗣则把它们按颜色排列在衣柜里。我就是这样一丝不苟。“这件还挺漂亮的。”真嗣拿起一件我两年没穿过的裙子。它是绿色的，前面有个俗气的蝴蝶结。

"I wear that when I don't care about what I look like." I hoped he was joking when he said it looked good.  
“我不在乎自己外表的时候就会穿那件。”我希望他说它好看是在开玩笑。

Shinji held another one up. This one was as red as my plugsuit, and stitched with lots of seed beads. It showed plenty of cleavage. However, when I expose one part of my body, the other has to be covered: it reached down to the floor. "What about this one?"  
真嗣又拿起一件。这件红得和我驾驶服一样，上面缝满了珠子。它露出了很多乳沟。不过，当我露出一部分身体时，另一部分就必须遮住：它一直拖到地板上。“这件怎么样？”

"Oh, I wore that one to a school dance in Germany. I like that one, so be careful with it."  
"哦，那件我在德国参加学校舞会时穿过。我很喜欢那件，所以小心点儿。"

And this went on. Whenever he found a dress he was curious about, he asked me for its origin. I told him, but only as much as I wanted to. In one box, there was a sweater from the college that I went to back in America. He asked what the strange characters meant.  
这种情况持续了一段时间。每当他发现一件他好奇的裙子，就会问我它的来历。我告诉他，但仅限于我想说的部分。在一个盒子里，有一件我曾在美国就读的大学的毛衣。他问那些奇怪的字符是什么意思。

"What does it say?"  
“上面写着什么？”

I paused. I didn't want to tell him that I already went to college. For what reason, I don't know why. Instead of saying " Princeton ", I told him it said a name of a famous beer in Germany. He didn't argue with me, just folded it back up and put it in a drawer. I need to remember to tell him I went to college next time the topic comes up.  
我顿了顿。我不想告诉他我已经上过大学了。出于什么原因，我也不清楚。我没有说“普林斯顿”，而是告诉他那是一个德国著名啤酒的名字。他没有和我争辩，只是把它叠好放回了抽屉。下次再提到这个话题时，我得记得告诉他我上过大学。

Of course, some of the things I was embarrassed to show him. Well, the embarrassment wasn't on _my part. One box was full of undergarments. I gave him a stack of white panties and told him to put that in the top drawer along with this box of bras. It was funny to watch him stammer and leave the room, saying "I'll be back once I get a glass of water."_  
当然，有些东西我不好意思给他看。不过，尴尬的不是我。一个箱子里装满了内衣。我递给他一堆白色内裤，让他把这些和这盒胸罩一起放进最上面的抽屉里。看着他结结巴巴地离开房间，说“我去喝杯水就回来”，真是好笑。

_

It was good for a laugh.  
这确实让人捧腹。

True to his word, he came back a minute later with a single glass. "Where's mine?" I demanded.  
他果然信守承诺，一分钟后拿着一个玻璃杯回来了。“我的呢？”我质问道。

"You didn't ask for one!"  
"你没说要啊！"

I stopped stacking boxes in a corner long enough to glare at him. "Well, you should know that I'm thirsty too! I've been working harder than you."  
我停下在角落堆箱子的动作，瞪了他一眼。“哼，你也该知道我也很渴！我比你干得还多呢。”

"You're just taking stuff out of the boxes! I'm the one who has to walk all over your room to put stuff away!"  
"你只是在从箱子里拿东西！我才是那个得在你的房间里走来走去收拾东西的人！"

Damn. He had a point.  
该死。他说得有道理。

Shinji offered the water glass anyway, and I snatched it out of his hand and drank in greedy swallows. I handed back the empty glass and returned to my unpacking. We had the majority of the clothes out of the way, and the rest was stuff that I could handle on my own. The rest of the boxes contained the things that I couldn't wear.  
真嗣还是递来了水杯，我一把从他手里抢过来，贪婪地大口喝着。我把空杯子递回去，继续整理行李。大部分衣服已经处理好了，剩下的东西我可以自己搞定。剩下的箱子里装的是我不能穿的东西。

These material things that I had come to cherish.  
这些我曾珍视的物质之物。

"Now listen very closely, because I'm only going to say this once." He set the glass down on a shelf and turned his full attention to me. I couldn't help but sound impatient, but I sound that way when I want to be paid attention to. "These next things are my things. You can leave if you want now; I have no use for you."  
“现在仔细听好，因为我只说一次。”他把玻璃杯放在架子上，将全部注意力转向我。我不禁显得有些不耐烦，但当我希望被关注时，我总是这样。“接下来的这些是我的东西。你现在可以选择离开；我对你已无用处。”

Shinji looked hurt. 真嗣看起来很受伤。

"Let me finish what I was going to say!" I closed one eye and rubbed a temple. He takes things way too seriously. "You can sit there and watch as I put these things away, or you can sit outside my door. Either way, I don't want you talking. Got it? No questions, no comments, no talking unless I talk to you or ask you a question." This way, I can only reveal as much or as little about myself as I want to.  
"“让我把话说完！”我闭上一只眼，揉了揉太阳穴。他太认真了。“你可以坐在这儿看着我把这些东西收好，或者坐在我门外。总之，我不想听到你说话。明白吗？不许提问，不许评论，除非我主动跟你说话或问你问题，否则别出声。这样，我就能控制自己透露多少信息。”

The boy stood there like he didn't know what to do. The reason that he was here was because of that synch training, under normal circumstances he wouldn't come within an inch of this room when I started unpacking my other things. I didn't even know why I was giving him the option to stay or leave.  
那男孩站在那里，仿佛不知所措。他来这儿是因为同步训练，正常情况下，我收拾其他东西时，他连这房间一寸都不会靠近。我甚至不知道自己为何给他选择留下或离开的余地。

It was so unlike me.  
这完全不像我。

He decided to stay. Shinji sat down on the bed, crosslegged. I sighed and tore into a box. I lifted the contents, a small library of favorite books I liked to read. One of them was a complete volume of Shakespeare's plays (a friend gave that to me). It might surprise some people, but Sohryu Asuka Langley liked plays.  
他决定留下。真嗣盘腿坐在床上。我叹了口气，撕开一个箱子。我举起里面的东西，是一小批我喜欢的书。其中一本是莎士比亚戏剧全集（一个朋友送给我的）。这可能会让一些人惊讶，但惣流·明日香·兰格雷喜欢戏剧。

I don't want that bit of information to get out. Probably ruin my reputation and brand me as a bookworm, which I certainly was not.  
我不想让那点信息泄露出去。可能会毁了我的名声，还给我贴上书呆子的标签，我当然不是那种人。

I held a book up for Shinji to inspect. "Did you know that Edgar Allan Poe married his cousin when she was in her early teens?" It was always a treat to show off how much I know.  
我拿了一本书给真嗣检查。“你知道埃德加·爱伦·坡在他表妹十几岁时就娶了她吗？”炫耀我知道多少总是件乐事。

He shook his head. "No. What does it say on the cover?"  
他摇了摇头。“不知道。封面上写了什么？”

"It says 'Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque'. He liked his horror stories, you know."  
"上面写着‘怪诞与阿拉伯式’。他喜欢恐怖故事，你知道的。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

I became a little more casual. "Can you just imagine it? Marrying your own cousin? That's sick, that's so sick I don't even want to think about it. I guess that's not as bad as marrying your sister... or your mom even."  
我变得稍微随意了一些。“你能想象吗？和自己的表亲结婚？那太病态了，病态到我甚至不想去想它。我想这比和自己的妹妹……甚至妈妈结婚要好一些。”

Shinji tilted his head to the side. "Isn't he an American?"  
真嗣歪了歪头。“他不是美国人吗？”

I put those books on top of the nearest shelf. "Yeah, why?"  
我把那些书放在最近的架子上。“是啊，为什么？”

"I don't know... I was just wondering if you've been to America."  
“我不知道...我只是想知道你是否去过美国。”

I paused. "I was on an extended trip there. Once." That wasn't entirely a lie, college could be counted as an extended trip, especially if your home is in Germany.  
我顿了顿。“我在那里有过一次长时间的旅行。”这话并不完全虚假，大学生活可以算作一次长旅，尤其是当你家在德国时。

"What's it like? I mean, in America?"  
“那里怎么样？我是说，在美国？”

I ripped into another box. It held just one thing, a silver picture frame with no picture. I planned on taking a snapshot of Kaji and me and putting it in there one day, but I never got the chance. Besides, I wasn't really a picture kind of person. Didn't like them. "Hey, I thought I said that only I ask the questions around here."  
我又撕开了一个箱子。里面只装了一样东西，一个没有照片的银色相框。我本打算有一天拍一张我和卡吉的照片放进去，但我从未有机会。此外，我并不是那种喜欢拍照的人。不喜欢照片。“嘿，我记得我说过这里只能由我来提问。”

"Uh... sorry." Shinji looked down.  
"呃... 对不起。" 真嗣低下头。

While he had broken one of my rules, I still wanted to answer him. "America is so dirty and filthy it should be outlawed. People say it's really gone downhill since Second Impact, you know..." I put that pictureless frame next to the books. "... promise me you'll never visit there. Unless you want your _ass kicked."_  
尽管他违反了我的一条规则，我还是想回答他。"美国太脏太乱了，应该被禁止。人们说自从第二次冲击后，它真的每况愈下，你知道的..." 我把那个没有照片的相框放在书旁边。"... 答应我，你永远不会去那里。除非你想挨揍。"

_

I tossed that box aside. It surprised Shinji to know there was only one thing in most of these boxes when I told him. I decided to answer the question before it came up. "I don't want any of them getting broken or damaged. It makes sense that you use one box per item, doesn't it?"  
我把那个盒子扔到一边。当我告诉真嗣这些盒子里大多数只有一个东西时，他很惊讶。我决定在问题提出之前回答。"我不想让它们中的任何一个被打破或损坏。一个物品用一个盒子，这很合理，对吧？"

"It does." "确实如此。"

"Of course it does." I opened another box and took out a pair of binoculars and some assorted star gazing stuff. I don't even know why I packed it, and I just tossed them onto a shelf. The next box had my old shampoo and all my toiletries. "Hey, I've been looking for these!"  
"当然如此。" 我又打开一个箱子，拿出了一副双筒望远镜和一些观星用品。我甚至不知道为什么要打包这些，随手就把它们扔到了架子上。下一个箱子里装着我的旧洗发水和所有洗漱用品。"嘿，我一直在找这些！"

The comment invited Shinji to ask a question, so he did. I let it slide. "What is it?"  
这番话让真嗣有了提问的冲动，于是他问了。我任由他继续。"什么事？"

I held up two bottles. "St. Ives. It's my shampoo that you asked about yesterday." I opened the spout of the bottle and smelled it. "No, that other shampoo smells better. I think I'm going to buy it if I ever get out of here." I lifted out a pink towel and washcloth. "Pink was the only color the department store had left, so don't even _try to make fun of me."_  
我举起两瓶洗发水。“圣艾夫斯。这就是你昨天问起的那款洗发水。”我打开瓶口闻了闻。“不，另一款洗发水闻起来更好。如果我能离开这里，我想我会买它的。”我拿出一条粉色毛巾和浴巾。“粉色是百货商店剩下的唯一颜色，所以别想取笑我。”

_

"I wasn't." "我没有。"

_Yeah right.  是啊，没错。_

_

I didn't say anything else during the rest of the unpacking and true to his word, neither did Shinji. I placed a large number of trinkets on my shelves, and I'm sure some of them were just dying to tell their story, but not now, not here. Once I finished, I asked him, "Do you have any underwear you want _me to see? C'mon, I showed you mine."_  
在剩下的拆包过程中，我没有再说任何话，而正如他承诺的那样，真嗣也没有。我在书架上摆放了许多小饰品，我确信其中一些正渴望讲述它们的故事，但不是现在，不是在这里。完成后，我问他，“你有没有内裤想让我看看？来吧，我可是给你看了我的。”

_

Shinji turned red again. This was far too easy. "N-No..."  
真嗣的脸又红了。这真是太容易了。“不-不是……”

"Not only did I show you once, I showed you twice!" I remembered that episode back on the boat. I had to remember to be careful of updrafts. "And I knew you liked it, so lying about not liking it is pointless. You pervert."  
“我不仅给你展示过一次，还展示过两次！”我想起了在船上的那一集。我得记住小心上升气流。“而且我知道你喜欢，所以否认喜欢是没意义的。你这个变态。”

"But... the wind... I didn't..."  
“但是……风……我没有……”

I took three boxes and threw them outside the room. "You go out there and flatten those boxes. That's my fee for me keeping your company for this past two hours."  
我拿了三个箱子扔到房间外。“你去外面把那些箱子压平。这是我陪你度过过去两个小时的费用。”

Shinji darted outside my room pretty quickly, holding one cheek as if I had slapped him. He ran to the kitchen and brought back a serrated knife. It'd be easier to cut the tape on the bottom of the boxes than pull them off. Smart idea.  
真嗣飞快地冲出我的房间，捂着一边脸颊，仿佛我扇了他一巴掌。他跑到厨房，拿回一把锯齿刀。割开箱子底部的胶带比撕下来要容易。聪明的想法。

"Hey Shinji... you want to make a game out of this?"  
“嘿，真嗣……你想不想把这变成一个游戏？”

"What?" "什么？"

"I said, do you want to make a game out of this?" If my friends ever found out that I made a game out of cutting cardboard boxes, I'd be the laughingstock of the NERV in Germany .  
“我说，你想玩个游戏吗？”如果我的朋友发现我居然把切割纸板箱当成游戏，我肯定会成为德国 NERV 的笑柄。

"Now why do you want to do that?"  
“现在你为什么要这么做呢？”

I threw a box outside. "Because I'm bored." Dangerous things happen when I'm bored, just like the things that happen to me when it's silent. I think both of those went hand in hand. "I'll throw the boxes outside and you cut them."  
我把一个箱子扔到了外面。“因为我无聊。”无聊时会发生危险的事情，就像我在寂静中遭遇的那些事一样。我觉得这两者是相辅相成的。“我把箱子扔出去，你来切割它们。”

"That doesn't sound like much of a game to me."  
“这听起来不像是个游戏。”

I poked my head around the corner and pointed at him angrily. "It's a rhythm thing! Full power, maximum performance! Once we get into the rhythm, it'll be a piece of cake."  
我探头探脑地绕过角落，生气地指着他。“这是节奏问题！全力以赴，发挥到极致！一旦我们进入节奏，那简直是小菜一碟。”

Shinji sounded skeptical. "That makes sense... we don't have anything better to do..."  
真嗣听起来有些怀疑。“这说得通……我们也没什么更好的事情可做……”

"Of course it does!" I turned my attention back to the boxes and got ready to throw. "Are you ready?"  
“当然说得通！”我重新把注意力转回到箱子上，准备投掷。“你准备好了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

I started throwing boxes over my shoulder. The first couple I could hear Shinji scrambling to get because they fell short of where he was sitting. Always bump, and then the serrated knife cut through. Rip. Bump. Rip. At first, I was throwing the boxes every eight seconds, then as my arms began to get the hang of throwing over my head, the time became less and less.  
我开始把箱子从肩膀上扔过去。前几个我能听到真嗣慌忙去捡，因为它们落在了他坐的地方前面。总是先砰的一声，然后锯齿刀切开。撕裂。砰。撕裂。起初，我每八秒扔一个箱子，但随着我的手臂逐渐习惯从头顶扔东西，时间间隔越来越短。

Bump. Rip. 撞击。撕裂。

Bump. Rip. 撞击。撕裂。

Bump. Rip. 撞击。撕裂。

I could hear Shinji getting more efficient at the job as well. Sometimes the box would bounce twice on the ground, and sometimes I could hear it slide across the floor. The time from the bump to the rip shortened so much that I was throwing a box every three seconds and we were keeping perfect time. It grew to the point that I didn't even hear the bump on the ground anymore.  
我也能听到真嗣在这项工作上越来越熟练。有时箱子会在地上弹跳两次，有时我能听到它滑过地板的声音。从撞击到撕裂的时间缩短了这么多，以至于我每三秒钟就扔一个箱子，我们保持着完美的节奏。到了我甚至不再听到箱子落地声的地步。

Rip.

Rip.

Rip.

"Almost done, Shinji!" “快完成了，真嗣！”

"I know, Asuka!" “我知道，明日香！”

I threw the last box over my head and whirled around to watch him. He caught it in his arms and dragged the knife across the underside. He flattened it in one swift movement and tossed it to the side where other flattened boxes were. He looked at me, and we both stared, smiling proudly like we just accomplished the hardest task in the world. We must have looked quite a sight too, a boy with a serrated knife in one hand and a girl sweating like she'd been hauling bricks all day.  
我将最后一个箱子抛过头顶，转身看着他。他双臂接住，用刀在底部划过。他迅速将其压平，扔到一旁已经堆放好的扁平箱子旁。他看着我，我们都凝视着对方，自豪地微笑，仿佛刚刚完成了世界上最艰难的任务。我们一定看起来相当引人注目，一个男孩一手拿着锯齿刀，一个女孩汗流浃背，仿佛一整天都在搬运砖块。

I heard someone clap, someone out of my line of sight. "That was wonderful."  
我听到有人鼓掌，那人不在我的视线范围内。“真是精彩。”

"Misato?" “美里？”

"Misato!" I abandoned my staring with Shinji and rushed out of the room. I was hoping Kaji would be with her again, but he wasn't there. "Geez, where have you been?"  
“美里！”我不再盯着真嗣，冲出了房间。我本希望加持会和她在一起，但他不在。“天哪，你去哪儿了？”

"Watching." Her eyes went from me, and then to Shinji, and then the stack of flattened boxes. "This apartment looks so much cleaner without them."  
"观察着。" 她的目光从我身上移开，转向了真嗣，然后是那堆压扁的箱子。"这个公寓没有它们看起来干净多了。"

"Maybe if the apartment was bigger, it wouldn't have looked so cluttered," I retorted.  
"也许如果公寓再大一点，就不会显得那么杂乱了，" 我反驳道。"

Misato shrugged. "It's time to start your twister test again. Get that set up so we can work."  
美里耸了耸肩。"是时候重新开始你的扭曲测试了。把设备准备好，我们好开始工作。"

The words of death. I didn't want to go through that boot camp again, but when I realized that it was 3:30, I knew that she couldn't possibly hold us as long as she did last time. Besides, if that crazy box game was any indication, we should be getting close to synchronization. I know I couldn't base any conclusion off cutting up a box, but I had nothing else to go on.  
死亡的宣言。我不想再经历一次那样的训练营，但当我意识到已经 3:30 时，我知道她不可能像上次那样拖我们那么久。而且，如果那个疯狂的盒子游戏能说明什么的话，我们应该快要同步了。我知道不能仅凭切割一个盒子就得出结论，但我别无选择。

"I'm hungry." “我饿了。”

Good idea Shinji! Anything to stall for time. "Me too."  
好主意，真嗣！任何能拖延时间的事。“我也是。”

Our guardian smiled. "Then let's eat."  
我们的守护者笑了。“那我们吃饭吧。”

*****

We finally started at 4:00. The time seemed to pass quickly, because before I knew it, it was 7:00 in the evening. Time always flies when you're... getting better at what you are doing. I wouldn't say it was like having fun, but I was definitely amused. Our percentage rose from 53% to 86%, all in the span of one day.  
我们终于在四点钟开始了。时间似乎过得很快，不知不觉间，已经是晚上七点了。当你在做的事情上有所进步时，时间总是飞逝。我不能说这像是在玩乐，但我确实感到有趣。我们的百分比从 53%上升到了 86%，仅仅用了一天的时间。

I was pleased, but it still wasn't perfect.  
我感到满意，但仍未达到完美。

"Fourteen points." Misato mumbled. She wrote something down on a sheet of paper. "Okay, that's enough."  
“十四分。”美里喃喃道。她在一张纸上写下了什么。“好了，够了。”

We both stopped. 我们都停了下来。

"Take your showers and meet out again on the terrace. And I want you guys to stay out there for the whole hour this time."  
去洗个澡，然后到露台上集合。这次我要你们在那儿待满整个小时。

That sounded accusatory, so I had to give the reason why. "It was raining outside! We couldn't stay out there in the rain!"  
这话听起来像是在责备，所以我不得不解释原因。“外面在下雨！我们总不能淋着雨待在外面吧！”

"And why not? Shinji?"  
"为什么不呢？真嗣？"

Are you out of your mind? No sane person would follow those orders to stay on the balcony during a hard rain. I looked at Shinji, trying to make sense of the situation. Hey, he'd lived with the woman longer than I had, maybe he could explain some of her odd quirks.  
你疯了吗？任何心智正常的人都不会在暴雨中遵从那种命令待在阳台上。我看着真嗣，试图理解当前的情况。嘿，他比我更久地与那位女士生活在一起，也许他能解释她一些古怪的习惯。

"You disobeyed an order of mine."  
"你违抗了我的命令。"

"I _always_ disobey your orders, Misato," I said wryly.  
“我总是违抗你的命令，美里。”我苦笑着说。

"But those are different. This is an Angel training program, not practice."  
“但那些不一样。这是对使徒的训练程序，不是练习。”

"Why are you being so uptight about this? We skipped out twenty minutes in the _rain!"_  
“你为什么对这件事这么紧张？我们在雨中逃跑了二十分钟！”

_

Shinji spoke up. "It was me." Two pairs of disbelieving eyes turned to him, half wondering why he bothered to include himself in the conversation. "I... I didn't want anyone to get sick. I told Asuka to go inside and we went to sleep early. It was my fault."  
真嗣开口了。“是我。”两双难以置信的眼睛转向他，一半是疑惑他为何要将自己牵扯进对话。“我……我不想任何人生病。我让明日香进屋，我们早早睡了。是我的错。”

I blinked. Instead of scolding Shinji, Misato did another thing that I didn't understand. She grinned like it was the happiest moment of her life. She got up and didn't say another word as she strode to the door and closed it behind her.  
我眨了眨眼。美里没有责骂真嗣，反而做了另一件我不理解的事。她咧嘴笑得仿佛这是她一生中最快乐的时刻。她站起身来，一言不发地大步走向门口，随手关上了门。

A silence ensued. 一阵沉默随之而来。

"Now... do you understand what just happened?"  
"现在...你明白刚才发生了什么吗？"

"I have no idea."  
"我不知道。"

I turned to him, confused. "So... we're going to be living with her?" I started to question her sanity. I knew Misato from before, but she wasn't nearly this weird.  
我转向他，感到困惑。 "那么...我们要和她一起生活了？"我开始质疑她的理智。我以前就认识美里，但她远没有这么古怪。

He shrugged and started to say something, but Misato came back into the apartment holding Pen Pen. "Okay Shinji, Asuka. You move your futons to this room right here. Shinji, you go find me a futon as well..."  
他耸了耸肩，正要开口说些什么，但美里已经带着 Pen Pen 回到了公寓。“好了，真嗣，明日香。你们把被褥搬到这个房间来。真嗣，你也去找一床被褥给我……”

"... okay..." “……好的……”

"And Asuka, you can find me a pillow and a blanket..."  
“明日香，你帮我找一個枕头和一条毯子……”

I crossed my arms. I wasn't to be ordered around like some common maid! "... can't you find them yourself?"  
我交叉双臂。我可不是随便任人使唤的普通女仆！“……你自己不能找吗？”

Misato ignored my comment and smiled at Pen Pen. "We're going to sleep together like a happy family!"  
美里无视了我的评论，对着 Pen Pen 微笑。“我们要像一个幸福的家庭一样一起睡觉！”

Oh Lord. 哦，天哪。

Misato and I stared at each other for a long time. "Why are you sleeping here? Why tonight?"  
美里和我长时间地对视着。“你为什么睡在这里？为什么是今晚？”

Misato waved her hand up and down. "It's alright Asuka, I just want to make sure that your first night sleeping in the same room won't lead to something you'll regret in the morning."  
美里上下挥了挥手。“没事的，明日香，我只是想确保你们第一晚同房不会导致早上醒来后悔。”

"What?!" "什么？！"

She smiled. "Just kidding." Misato jerked her head over to where Shinji was trying to yank a futon out of a closet. "Go to the terrace with Shinji. I'll take care of our bedding."  
她笑了笑。“开个玩笑。”美里朝真嗣那边甩了甩头，他正试图从壁橱里拽出一条被褥。“和真嗣去阳台吧。我来铺床。”

*****

Another hour. A whole hour. It didn't seem so long, now that I think about it. I must have been in a really, really good mood, because I sacrificed half of the bench so that Shinji could lie down and look at the sky with me. Unlike last night, the stars were easily visible and the moon washed its pale glow over everything.  
又是一个小时。整整一个小时。现在想来，似乎并不算长。我一定是心情特别好，因为我让出了一半的长椅，好让真嗣能躺下来和我一起看天空。与昨晚不同，星星清晰可见，月亮将其苍白的光辉洒满一切。

I think we must have sat there for at least half an hour, listening to one another breathe and watching the stars trail across the sky. I felt oddly content.  
我想我们一定在那里坐了至少半小时，听着彼此的呼吸，看着星星划过夜空。我感到一种奇异的满足。

_Yes, content.  是的，满足。_

_

_I could tell there was a massive slowdown in the way I breathed. His might have sped up, who knows? We were even breathing in synchronization.  
我能感觉到我的呼吸明显放缓了。他的或许加快了，谁知道呢？我们甚至呼吸都同步了。_

_

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

He paused. "Do you... like it here in Japan?"  
他顿了顿。“你……喜欢这里吗，在日本？”

I had to think a while before answering that. "So far, I don't like it too well. Japanese people are so confusing to me. They say one thing and mean another... they hide their emotions, and their towels are scratchy."  
我得想一会儿才回答这个问题。“到目前为止，我不太喜欢。日本人对我来说太难懂了。他们说一套做一套……他们隐藏情感，而且他们的毛巾很粗糙。”

"I noticed they don't wash them too well, either." Shinji put an arm behind his head.  
"我发现他们洗得也不太干净。" 真嗣将一只手臂枕在脑后。

"And they're so flimsy that you practically have to use the whole stack before drying off. Damn NERV, they have unlimited monetary supplies and they can't even afford decent rags."  
"而且这些毛巾太薄了，几乎得用上一整叠才能擦干。该死的 NERV，他们有无限的财力，却连像样的毛巾都舍不得买。"

Shinji might have laughed, I don't know. I put my hands on my stomach and turned my head upwards towards his. His hair smelled like mine. "Shinji?"  
真嗣可能笑了，我不知道。我将双手放在肚子上，抬头看向他。他的头发闻起来和我的一样。 "真嗣？"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"Don't think you're going to get this from me every night."  
"别以为每晚都能从我这儿得到这个。"

"What?" "什么？"

I grinned at the sky, making positively sure he heard me. "After all, most men would give their right leg for the opportunity to go sky gazing with Sohryu Asuka Langley."  
我对着天空咧嘴一笑，确保他听得清清楚楚。"毕竟，大多数男人都愿意舍弃右腿，只为有机会与惣流·明日香·兰格雷一起观星。"

"I don't doubt that, either."  
"我也不怀疑这一点。"

The remark was more of a gentle tease and not a direct assault like my earlier taunts. It was meant in good nature, and I think he noticed that. And whatever remainder of the time we had left, we spent saying absolutely nothing. They say that silence speaks louder than words.  
那句话更像是一种温和的戏谑，而非我之前那种直接的挑衅。它是出于好意，我想他也注意到了这一点。至于剩下的时间，我们什么也没说。人们常说，沉默比言语更有力量。

I think I finally understand the meaning of that.  
我想我终于明白了那句话的含义。

When Misato finally came out, neither of us came in right away. Sad to say, and even sadder to admit, I didn't want to leave.  
当美里终于出来时，我们俩都没有立刻进去。说来难过，更难过的是承认，我不想离开。

Was it something in the chocolate chip pancakes I ate this morning?  
难道是因为今早吃的巧克力碎片煎饼？

"Asuka... let's go." Shinji sat up and stayed on the side of the bench for a second before standing. I didn't move. I wanted to be snappy and come back with some sort of retort, but I couldn't think of anything. And the thought of being bitchy repulsed me right now. Why ruin a good moment?  
“明日香...我们走吧。”真嗣坐起身，在长椅边停留了一会儿才站起来。我没有动。我本想机敏地回敬几句，却什么也想不出来。而且，此刻我并不想破坏这美好的时刻。为什么要毁掉它呢？

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

He looked down at me. "Yeah?"  
他低头看着我。“嗯？”

The light of the moon bounced off his hair but at the same time shrouded his face in shadow. It struck me of how handsome he was, in a very innocent kind of way. I shook my head, both wondering at where my mind was going and also forgetting what I was going to say to him. "Nothing. Forget I said anything."  
月光洒在他的头发上，却同时将他的脸庞笼罩在阴影中。我突然意识到他是多么英俊，带着一种纯真的气质。我摇了摇头，既惊讶于自己的思绪飘向何方，又忘了原本要对他说的话。“没什么。忘了我刚才说的吧。”

I hoped I wasn't appearing too soft. I've tested his sense of humor, his honor, his gallantry, and his determination. His patience and loyalty have been especially outstanding. I have one more test left, the one that determines where you are placed in my eyes. It's the hardest one of all, one that no boy or man has passed before, except for one. Kaji was the only one, would Ikari Shinji fit the same mold?  
我希望自己看起来不要太软弱。我已经考验了他的幽默感、荣誉感、骑士精神和决心。他的耐心和忠诚尤为突出。我还有一个测试，它决定了你在我的心目中的位置。这是最难的一个，之前没有一个男孩或男人通过，除了一个人。加持是唯一的一个，碇真嗣会符合同样的标准吗？

The test of being able to resist and the courage to pull back.  
抵抗的能力和退缩的勇气之考验。

Author's notes:  作者笔记：

*dodges hundreds of pens* Being a *gasp* secret romantic at heart (though I'll deny it), I just had to throw in a bit of what I _thought was IC waff. I'm a firm believer in my opinion that Evangelion really doesn't have any romance whatsoever in it, but is more of a maturing of mind and body by all the characters. No matter how much I love Shinji/Asuka, it's not going to lead to romance. Not yet ^_^_  
*躲开数百支笔* 作为一个内心深处的*喘气*秘密浪漫主义者（尽管我会否认），我不得不加入一些我认为是 IC 的甜腻情节。我坚信我的观点，即《新世纪福音战士》中根本没有浪漫元素，更多的是所有角色在心智和身体上的成熟。无论我多么喜欢真嗣和明日香，这都不会导向浪漫。至少现在不会^_^

### Chapter 6

The biggest headache that I've ever had the displeasure of having manifested itself in my throbbing temples this morning. As soon as I woke up, I felt like my head had been lodged between a vice and I had been thrown out of a ten-story building.  
我这辈子最不愉快的头痛经历，今早就在我跳动的太阳穴上显现了。一觉醒来，我感觉自己的头像是被夹在老虎钳里，然后又被从十层楼上扔了出去。

"Ugh..." “呃……”

As usual, Shinji was up and ready to go, I could smell breakfast in the air. I opened my eyes and my pupils caught on fire. Misato was sleeping in the futon next to me, snoring softly and sleeping with her appendages splayed in all directions.  
一如既往，真嗣已经起床准备好了，我能闻到空气中早餐的香味。我睁开眼睛，瞳孔瞬间被点燃。美里躺在我旁边的被褥里，轻轻地打着呼噜，四肢散乱地伸展着。

Weakly, I raised my arm and swiped at Misato's futon. "Hey... get up..." She snorted once, but made no other sign. I tried again with a little bit more force. "Hey! Get up... you slept in the past two days..." She swatted my hand away and put a pillow over her head.  
我无力地抬起手臂，朝美里的被褥挥了挥。“嘿...起床了...”她哼了一声，但没有其他反应。我又试了一次，稍微用了点力。“嘿！起床了...你已经睡了两天了...”她拍开我的手，把枕头盖在头上。

I know which battles I can't win.  
我知道哪些战斗是我赢不了的。

I stood up and nearly dragged myself to the bathroom. Above the hissing of eggs I could hear Shinji humming. The jerk. Damn his morning... morningness.  
我站起身，几乎是拖着自己走向浴室。在煎蛋的嘶嘶声中，我能听到真嗣在哼歌。这个混蛋。该死的他早晨的...活力。

By the time I realized morningness wasn't a word, I was already sitting at the table, yawning so much my tonsils almost fell out. He was listening to his SDAT player while flipping the eggs. I was right about the tape inside probably being boring symphony stuff, I recognized the tune he was humming as one of Beethoven's Brandenburg concertos.  
当我意识到'早晨感'并不是一个词时，我已经坐在桌前，打着哈欠，差点把扁桃体都打出来了。他一边听着他的 SDAT 播放器，一边翻着鸡蛋。我猜里面的磁带大概是乏味的交响乐，我认出他哼的曲子是贝多芬的勃兰登堡协奏曲之一。

They played those so many times in Germany ... well, at least he had good taste.  
他们在德国播放这些曲子那么多次...嗯，至少他的品味不错。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

He kept on humming.  
他继续哼着曲子。

"Hey idiot!" "嘿，傻瓜！"

Shinji finally acknowledged my existence and took off his earplugs. "What is it?"  
真嗣终于注意到我的存在，摘下了耳塞。“什么事？”

"Uh..." Shit. I just wanted him to know that I was here, that's all. I didn't really plan to say anything. Improvise Asuka! "You know, my hometown plays all those Beethoven things so many times I think I'll explode. Stop humming already, or if you're going to hum, then do it in tune."  
"呃..." 该死。我只是想让他知道我在这里，仅此而已。我并没有真的打算说什么。即兴发挥吧，明日香！“你知道吗，我的家乡老是放那些贝多芬的东西，听得我都快炸了。别再哼哼了，要么就哼得在调上。”

Shinji put down his spatula and left the eggs to their sizzling. "You knew what I was humming?"  
真嗣放下锅铲，任由鸡蛋在锅中滋滋作响。“你知道我在哼什么曲子？”

"Of course I do! Not only do I know everything there is to know about Beethoven, but all those bigwig German composers." I raised an eyebrow. "Bach, Handel, Mozart, Wagner, you name it."  
“当然知道！我不仅对贝多芬了如指掌，还有那些德国大作曲家们。”我挑了挑眉。“巴赫、亨德尔、莫扎特、瓦格纳，随便你说。”

Shinji took the frying pan off the heat and held it over a plate in front of me. The heat radiated from it and I was afraid the grease would fly on me, but the contents of the pan landed cleanly on my plate without splattering. "Do you want to listen to it while you eat?"  
真嗣将煎锅从火上移开，举到我面前的盘子上。热气从锅中散发出来，我担心油会溅到我身上，但锅里的食物干净利落地落在了我的盘子里，没有溅出任何油花。“你想边吃边听吗？”

The sincerity of the question touched me and struck a nerve that I didn't know I had. I set my fork down and glanced at Shinji. I'd really like it, listening to my country's music. However, I was afraid of turning nostalgic and saying something that I didn't mean. "No."  
那问题的真诚触动了我，触碰到了我未曾察觉的神经。我放下叉子，瞥了一眼真嗣。我真的很想听一听我国家的音乐。然而，我害怕陷入怀旧，说出一些并非本意的话。“不。”

"Oh."

I scooped the eggs into my mouth. "I'm tired of hearing of that stuff, you know. We can listen to it later, and you can hear my music which is considerably better."  
我把鸡蛋送入口中。“你知道，我已经听腻了那些东西。我们可以晚点再听，到时候你可以听听我的音乐，那可要好得多。”

Today was just a finishing of our synch training. We went immediately to the twister test and scored a 92% at our highest. Still eight points short. Misato had us eat lunch, which consisted of buckwheat noodles and a glass of milk. I never would think the two would go together.  
今天只是我们同步训练的收尾。我们立刻进行了旋风测试，最高得分达到了 92%。仍然差了八分。美里让我们吃了午餐，包括荞麦面和一杯牛奶。我从未想过这两样东西会搭配在一起。

"You three even eat alike," Misato remarked. The third she was referring to was Pen Pen, who seemed to want to take an active role in our synchronization.  
“你们三个连吃东西都这么像，”美里评论道。她指的是第三者是 Pen Pen，它似乎也想积极参与到我们的同步中来。

After lunch, neither of us wanted to do that twister thing again until later in the day. Instead, we did laundry. Yes, laundry. I never thought I could stoop so low. However, I did it anyway to bridge the eight-point gap that we still needed to close. If it took a day of doing mindless chores to destroy this Angel, then so be it.  
午饭后，我们俩都不想再做那个扭曲的事情，直到晚些时候。相反，我们洗了衣服。是的，洗衣服。我从没想过自己会堕落到这种地步。然而，我还是这么做了，为了缩小我们仍需弥补的八分差距。如果花一天时间做这些无脑的家务就能摧毁这个使徒，那就这样吧。

"Put the whites on a cold setting and the colors on warm."  
"把白色衣物放在冷水档，彩色衣物放在温水档。"

And so on. We washed them and hung them up to dry, Shinji throwing me the clothes and me hanging them on the wire. It seems that our box game evolved into a laundry game too. Our rhythm developed almost as soon as he threw the first article of clothing, which happened to be one of my bras.  
就这样，我们洗了衣服并挂起来晾干，真嗣把衣服扔给我，我则把它们挂在晾衣绳上。看来我们的盒子游戏也演变成了洗衣游戏。几乎在他扔出第一件衣物——碰巧是我的一个胸罩——的同时，我们的节奏就形成了。

"What do you want to listen to first? No... let me guess... something by Liszt? Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers"?"  
"你想先听什么？不...让我猜猜...是李斯特的作品吗？还是柴可夫斯基的《花之圆舞曲》？"

Shinji blinked. "Do you?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“你呢？”

We did. Though I wouldn't let him get away with making me listen to classical music (and me actually liking it), so I popped a cassette in with what happened to be my favorite German band, "Ewigkeit". Shinji had two identical cassettes, that's how we listened to his Vivaldi tape on separate SDATs, but I only had one cassette. I gave him an earplug and kept one for myself. I was considering giving him both of the since I'd heard all those songs so many times before, but I'll admit I am selfish.  
我们确实这么做了。虽然我不会让他轻易得逞，让我听古典音乐（而我居然还喜欢上了），所以我塞了一盘磁带，里面正好是我最喜欢的德国乐队，“永恒”。真嗣有两盘一模一样的磁带，这就是我们如何分别用 SDAT 听他的维瓦尔第磁带的方法，但我只有一盘。我给了他一个耳塞，自己留了一个。我本考虑把两个都给他，因为我之前已经听过那些歌很多遍了，但我承认我有点自私。

"Smile!" Misato took a picture of us underneath our underwear, tapping our fingers to the beat of the lead guitarist's screaming overdrive. I tried to snatch that photograph from her, but she promised she wouldn't show a soul. "Just everyone at NERV. After all, most of them don't have souls."  
“笑一个！”美里在我们穿着内裤的时候给我们拍了张照片，我们的手指随着主音吉他手尖叫般的过载节奏敲打。我试图从她那里抢过那张照片，但她保证不会给任何人看。“只是给 NERV 的每个人看看。毕竟，他们中的大多数都没有灵魂。”

Music links two souls together, and although my taste was worlds apart from Shinji's, I actually liked getting back to my roots. And although he looked at me kind of funny after listening to a song and saying that his eardrums were ringing, I think he liked it. "Don't make me listen to it again, all right?"  
音乐将两个灵魂连接在一起，尽管我的品味与真嗣相去甚远，但我确实喜欢回归本源。虽然他在听完一首歌并说他的耳膜在响后，看我的眼神有点奇怪，但我想他喜欢。“别让我再听一遍，好吗？”

"Same thing here." 这里也一样。

When we went back inside, I was greeted with the second biggest surprise of my life.  
当我们回到屋内时，我遇到了我一生中第二大的惊喜。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

The class rep was standing inside, yanking the ear of one of Shinji's two friends. The most annoying lout of the three stooges. "Hey! It's not my fault she's the devil..."  
班长站在里面，拽着真嗣两个朋友之一的耳朵。三个傻瓜中最讨厌的那个。“嘿！她是个恶魔又不是我的错……”

My glare shot over to Misato. They were here again? She was parading us like circus animals.  
我的怒视转向了美里。他们又来了？她把我们当马戏团动物一样展示。

Once Hikari let go of Touji's ear, he came over and slapped Shinji on the back, effectively separating the two of us. He whispered something in his ear, to which Shinji shook his head. It must be something about me.  
一旦光放开冬二的耳朵，他就走过来拍了拍真嗣的背，有效地把我们俩分开了。他在真嗣耳边低语了几句，真嗣摇了摇头。肯定是在说我。

"Shut up stooge," I growled. As if controlled by some unseen force, I stepped onto the twister mat and threw daggers at Touji. That was enough to send him scuttling back to his miserable friend and conspiring against me. "If you have the nerve to talk about me, then you must have balls enough to say it out loud."  
"闭嘴，马屁精，" 我咆哮道。仿佛被某种无形的力量操控，我踏上了旋转垫，向真嗣投去锋利的目光。这足以让他仓皇逃回他那可怜的朋友身边，密谋对付我。"如果你有胆量议论我，那你一定有足够的胆量大声说出来。"

Misato held her hands up. "Let's start the synch training."  
美里举起双手。"让我们开始同步训练吧。"

I looked at Shinji. "Remember Shinji, full power, maximum performance."  
我看向真嗣。"记住，真嗣，全力出击，发挥最大性能。"

"I know that," he replied. "We'll finish in forty-six seconds."  
"我知道，"他回答道，"我们将在四十六秒内完成。"

The occupants of the room disappeared in my mind, and all I saw were red circles. Red targets waiting to be pounced on. The honor was given to Pen Pen; he flipped the switch, and we began.  
房间里的其他人从我脑海中消失了，我眼中只剩下红色的圆圈。红色的目标等待着被扑击。这份荣耀属于 Pen Pen；他翻转了开关，我们便开始了。

This is the effort of three days. This is what I am capable of, and I can do even more than this. I've turned a timid little boy into a commander and even found something out about myself in the process. I was actually going to _like staying here with Misato, Pen Pen, and the Third Child._  
这是三天努力的成果。这是我所能做到的，我甚至能做得更多。我已将一个胆怯的小男孩塑造成了一位指挥官，并在过程中发现了自己的一些新东西。我竟然真的开始喜欢和美里、Pen Pen 以及第三适格者一起待在这里了。

_

What about my test for Shinji? I haven't met a guy who made it this far with me, and since this was a once in a lifetime chance to test it, I wanted to do it. I didn't know whether or not to go through with that, it'd force me to remember some terrible things that I would rather not—  
我的测试对真嗣怎么样了？我还没遇到过能和我一起走到这一步的人，既然这是一生一次的机会来测试它，我想去做。我不知道是否该继续，那会迫使我回忆起一些我宁愿忘记的可怕事情——

"Shit!" I exclaimed. “该死！”我喊道。

Synch ratio: 99%. The room went silent as an Eva in stasis after the twister machine announced the ratio and beeped once before shutting off. Everyone was looking at me, and I knew exactly why. While Shinji's hand landed on a lighted circle, mine did not.  
同步率：99%。当龙卷风机器宣布这个比率并哔一声后关闭时，整个房间陷入了沉默，仿佛一台处于静止状态的 Eva。所有人都盯着我，我完全明白为什么。当真嗣的手落在一个亮起的圆圈上时，我的却没有。

The last second to go, and I choked.  
最后一秒，我失手了。

Our three visitors were watching us, not wondering what we would say next and fearing to open their mouths. Even the idiot stooge kept his words to himself. Misato blinked there rather stupidly, mirroring what I was feeling inside.  
我们的三位访客正注视着我们，不敢开口，生怕我们接下来会说些什么。就连那个笨蛋跟班也把话憋在心里。美里在那里傻乎乎地眨眼，仿佛映照出我内心的感受。

Sohryu Asuka Langley made a mistake.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷犯了个错误。

"Uh... I..." “呃... 我...”

"Let's do it again."  
“我们再来一次。”

The command broke the silence so suddenly that all of our eyes went over to Shinji, not believing what he said. Upon seeing all eyes were on him, he coughed weakly and put his hand behind his head. "I should have been paying more attention. If I had been really synched, I would have landed on the same unlightened circle."  
这个命令突如其来，以至于我们的目光都转向了真嗣，不敢相信他所说的话。看到所有人都盯着他，他虚弱地咳嗽了一声，把手放在后脑勺上。“我本该更专注的。如果我真的同步了，我应该会落在同一个未点亮的圆圈上。”

Everyone stared. 大家都愣住了。

"Let's do it again," he repeated.  
“再来一次，”他重复道。

Pen Pen flipped the switch again, and the circles started flashing. I didn't let my mind wander this time, because all I could think about was how much of a fool Shinji made of me. It was perfectly clear who did the mistake, and he seemed to draw attention to it by blaming it on himself.  
Pen Pen 再次按下开关，圆圈开始闪烁。这次我没有分心，满脑子都是真嗣让我出丑的情景。很明显是谁犯了错，而他似乎通过自责来强调这一点。

I was determined to get a perfect score now, more than ever. I can't wait until I can start to be my own person again.  
我此刻比以往任何时候都决心要拿到满分。我迫不及待地想要重新做回自己。

Once the countdown started, we never lost that mental link. As a final flourish, I put my arm out to steady myself from falling over backward and straightened up. Shinji did the same.  
一旦倒计时开始，我们之间的心灵感应就从未断过。最后，我伸出一只手臂稳住自己以防向后摔倒，然后站直了身子。真嗣也做了同样的动作。

Synch ratio: 100%. 同步率：100%。

Pen Pen flapped his wings and squealed while Misato, Hikari, and Kensuke clapped. Touji did none of the above but cross his arms and nod to himself.  
Pen Pen 拍打着翅膀，发出尖叫，而美里、光子和肯斯则鼓掌。冬二没有做这些，只是交叉双臂，自顾自地点头。

"Ha!" I put my shoulders on my hips and stood like a queen. "You thought we couldn't do it, but once again, I proved you all _wrong!"_  
"哈！" 我双手叉腰，像女王一样站立。"你以为我们做不到，但我又一次证明了你们都错了！"

_

"Congratulations, Asuka! Shinji!"  
"恭喜，明日香！真嗣！"

Shinji receded into the background and took the applause somewhat awkwardly. "T-Thank you."  
真嗣退到幕后，有些尴尬地接受了掌声。“谢、谢谢大家。”

Without ceremony, everyone got up and left rather quickly, like they were trying to see who would be the first one out. The two boys went first, but not before giving us a thumbs up. I stuck my tongue out at them. Hikari went next and said congratulations again. After Hikari had closed the door, we turned to look at Misato. She was still clapping.  
大家没有多说什么，迅速起身离开，仿佛在比赛谁先出门。两个男孩率先走了，临走前还给我们竖了个大拇指。我朝他们吐了吐舌头。光随后也走了，再次祝贺了我们。光关上门后，我们转向看向美里。她还在鼓掌。

"I knew you guys could do it."  
“我就知道你们能行。”

"Yeah, I knew I could," I said haughtily.  
"是啊，我就知道我能行，"我傲慢地说道。

"Thank you." Shinji bowed.  
"谢谢你。" 真嗣鞠了一躬。

She took her papers in her hand and stood up. Giving us a small salute, she walked over to the door. "Now whatever you do, keep that bond. Don't lose it."  
她手里拿着文件站了起来。向我们微微敬了个礼，她走向门口。"现在无论做什么，都要保持那份羁绊。不要失去它。"

"We won't," we both assured her.  
"我们不会的，" 我们都向她保证。

"And you'll be sleeping in the living room together, alone. So don't do anything stupid, all right."  
"你们俩会一起睡在客厅里，单独相处。所以别做傻事，好吗？"

"Go away already!" "快走开！"

"M-Misato!" "美-美里小姐！"

Misato closed the door, and we found ourselves looking at each other blankly. Once I saw his face, I became angry again. Even though the goal was reached, there was no escaping he made an idiot out of me, unintentionally or otherwise. I was going through with this test now.  
美里关上了门，我们茫然地对视着。一看到他的脸，我又生气了。尽管目标达成了，但无法否认他让我出了洋相，不管是有意还是无意。我现在要继续进行这个测试。

"Congratulations, Asuka."  
"恭喜你，明日香。"

Unfortunately, the only way that this test would work was to let out my anger and become 100% Asuka again. "Shut up, Third," I growled.  
遗憾的是，这个测试唯一有效的方法就是释放我的愤怒，重新变回 100%的明日香。“闭嘴，第三者，”我咆哮道。

Shinji was so taken aback by my response that he stepped back. "Asuka?"  
真嗣被我的反应吓了一跳，后退了一步。“明日香？”

No way was I going to forgive him. That was totally unacceptable for him to do such a thing. I thought Japanese were very subtle and were able to pick up such things, but apparently I was mistaken. "I'm taking a shower now." I said coldly. The time was now 5:00. "And stop looking at me like that already."  
我绝不会原谅他。他做出那样的事完全不可接受。我以为日本人很含蓄，能察觉到这些细节，但显然我错了。“我现在要去洗澡了。”我冷冷地说道。时间是五点整。“别再那样看着我了。”

Time to put my plan into action.  
是时候将我的计划付诸行动了。

I stormed out of the room, but not before something on the floor caught my eye. It was slightly underneath the table where Hikari and the stooges were sitting. Curious, I bent over to pick it up. Misato must have left it behind, it had a NERV logo imprinted into the plastic. It was a disk, and the label was written in a sloppy yet flowery handwriting that I had seen many times before.  
我怒气冲冲地走出房间，但在离开前，地上有样东西吸引了我的注意。它略微藏在 Hikari 和那帮跟班坐的桌子下面。出于好奇，我弯腰捡了起来。这一定是 Misato 落下的，塑料上印着 NERV 的标志。这是一张磁盘，标签上的字迹潦草却带着花哨，我之前见过很多次。

I walked out of the room, knowing I was leaving a dumbstruck Shinji behind. "To My... something..." I whispered. I didn't completely understand what it said on the label, but I quickly understood the heart.  
我走出房间，知道 Shinji 一定被我弄得目瞪口呆。“给我的……某人……”我低声念道。虽然标签上的字我没完全看懂，但我很快明白了其中的心意。

Kaji wrote it. 加治写了它。

*****

_I don't believe...  我不相信..._

_

I popped the disk into a computer that happened to be lying around the Katsuragi apartment. Seems she had an endless supply of these things, being the Operations Director. Once I put in the disk and the disk came up, I think my heart broke in two.  
我将那张光盘插入卡兹拉吉公寓里恰好闲置的一台电脑中。看来作为运营总监，她有无穷无尽的这类东西。当我放入光盘，画面出现时，我想我的心碎成了两半。

The salutation was in English, and the only part that I understood without the help of an internet translator.  
问候语是用英语写的，唯一不需要借助网络翻译就能理解的部分。

_To My Dearest Honey.  致我最亲爱的宝贝。_

_

"Asuka, are you in there?"  
“明日香，你在里面吗？”

"Yes already!" I spat out through a mouthful of water. "Doesn't the shower running tell you this?!"  
“是的，早就进来了！”我含着满嘴的水回答，“难道淋浴的声音还不能告诉你吗？！”

Never interrupt me when I am thinking.  
我思考时切勿打断我。

I wrung my hair out, the shampoo and water hitting the floor with a loud slap. How could Misato do this to me? More importantly, how could Kaji? I had passed sadness with crying a long time ago already, now I felt so many emotions I didn't know which one to start with.  
我拧干头发，洗发水和水重重地拍在地板上。美里怎么能这样对我？更重要的是，加持怎么可以？很久以前我就已经哭够了，现在我感到如此多的情绪，不知该从哪一种开始。

Kaji suggested it. It was all Kaji's idea. It was his idea to pair Shinji and I together. His idea to have me live here. His idea to toss me aside once he was done with me.  
加治提议的。这都是加治的主意。是他提议让真嗣和我配对。是他让我住在这里。也是他利用完我就把我抛到一边。

I knew that I couldn't win this from the very first moment I laid eyes on him. He had a sadness in his eyes that told me he had been hurt before, crushed almost. When he repeatedly rejected my advances, I knew that sadness had to be linked to a woman. Despite all my urgings, he would not tell me her name.  
从我第一眼见到他时，我就知道我赢不了。他的眼中藏着一种悲伤，告诉我他曾受过伤，几乎被击垮。当他一再拒绝我的示好时，我知道那种悲伤一定与一个女人有关。尽管我一再追问，他就是不肯告诉我她的名字。

Then I saw the way his eyes flashed on the UN carrier.  
然后我看到了他在联合国航母上眼神的变化。

Why was I so resolute in not wanting to stay with Misato? Because if Kaji visited, I wouldn't know if he was coming to see me or her. I'd rather live alone than be subjected to that.  
为什么我如此坚决不想和美里住在一起？因为如果加持来访，我无法确定他是来看我还是看她。我宁愿独自生活，也不愿面对那种尴尬。

"I'm coming out, so don't look at me."  
“我要出来了，别盯着我看。”

"F-Fine." “好——好吧。”

_I'm tired of being alone.  
我厌倦了孤独。_

_

After I came back from college, I first saw Kaji roaming the halls of the German branch of NERV. I didn't know who he was and I hadn't seen him before, so I was instantly suspicious. What attracted me to him? Well, that's an easy question to answer, because it certainly wasn't looks. He was scruffy, unkempt, and I'm sure mothers all over the world would say that "Stay away from that boy."  
从大学回来后，我第一次看到 Kaji 在 NERV 德国分部的走廊上游荡。我不认识他，之前也没见过他，所以立刻起了疑心。是什么吸引了我？嗯，这个问题很容易回答，因为肯定不是外表。他邋遢、不修边幅，我相信全世界的母亲都会说：“离那个男孩远点。”

_Mothers would?  母亲们会吗？_

_

He said that I should stop glaring at him. I narrowed my eyes and said that this was a restricted area and he should get the hell out before I smash him with my Eva. When he didn't appear to understand what I was saying, I said in Japanese that he was an ugly man. Then to my surprise, he replied in Japanese that he was ugly because God had given all the beauty to me.  
他说我应该停止瞪他。我眯起眼睛，告诉他这是禁区，让他赶紧滚蛋，否则我就用我的 Eva 砸扁他。当他似乎没明白我的话时，我用日语说他是个丑男人。令我惊讶的是，他用日语回答说，他之所以丑，是因为上帝把所有的美都给了我。

I was hooked instantly.  
我立刻就被吸引住了。

Misato would agree, it wasn't looks. It was charisma, charm, that certain _something that a real man exudes when he looks women in the eye. Boys don't have this; I've already searched long and far. Even in college, the idiots were after just one thing anyways._  
美里会同意的，这不是外表的问题。这是魅力，是那种当一个男人直视女人眼睛时散发出的某种特质。男孩们没有这个；我已经找了很久，走得很远。即使在大学里，那些白痴也只追求一件事。

_

I tacked Ikari Shinji as just another one of these wannabe men, and my opinion would stay that way until I could find out for sure. Thus, my tests. Most of the time, I already knew what separated a boy from a man and I didn't have to give tests. But Shinji... he was a mystery. He had traits of both, like a wisdom beyond his years while simultaneously remaining oblivious to his surroundings. No man would blush at the comments I make, yet at the slightest suggestion his face would burn like a match. However, he was hardened in a way that I couldn't quite put my finger on...  
起初，我把碇真嗣看作是又一个自命不凡的男孩，我的看法直到我能确切了解他之前都不会改变。因此，我进行了测试。大多数时候，我已经知道男孩与男人之间的区别，无需再进行测试。但真嗣...他是个谜。他既有超越年龄的智慧，同时又对周围环境一无所知。没有男人会因为我的一句话而脸红，但只要稍加暗示，他的脸就会像火柴一样燃烧起来。然而，他在某种程度上又显得坚不可摧，我无法准确指出那是什么...

_Tonight I'll know.  今晚我会知道。_

_

Grabbing two towels, I hurriedly wrapped one around me and used another to dry my hair. I stepped out of the shower, flooding the bathroom with herbal shampoo scent and heralding my appearance. "Where is Misato?" I asked.  
抓起两条毛巾，我匆忙地用一条裹住自己，另一条用来擦干头发。我走出淋浴间，浴室里弥漫着草本洗发水的香味，预示着我的出现。“美里在哪里？”我问道。

"Late night job on the phone. She won't be back."  
“电话上的深夜工作。她不会回来了。”

Misato won't be back? Meaning... she'll be at NERV, meaning there was no one manning the cameras next door. Meaning...  
美里不会回来了？也就是说...她会在 NERV，意味着隔壁的监控摄像头没有人看守。意味着...

"This is perfect," I said quietly.  
“这太完美了，”我轻声说道。

Your final test, Ikari Shinji.  
你的最终测试，碇真嗣。

*****

He showered, got dressed, and put on his headphones immediately afterwards. Seems that he was only willing to get rid of those up until we got synchronized, now he was retreating back into his shell. I carefully rolled out my bedding on the other side of the room. Luckily, there was a door I could slide shut. I figured that we were already synchronized, and no one was watching, so what was the point of sleeping right next to each other?  
他洗了个澡，穿好衣服，随后立刻戴上了耳机。看来他只愿意在我们同步之前摆脱那些，现在他又缩回了自己的壳里。我小心翼翼地在房间的另一边铺开我的被褥。幸运的是，有一扇门我可以滑动关闭。我想既然我们已经同步了，也没人在看，那睡在彼此旁边还有什么意义呢？

With one hand on the door, I growled menacingly, "Take one step over this door, and you'll be a _dead man. It's time for the children to go to sleep now!" I slammed it shut and repeated that Japanese were so stupid, sleeping on the floor like animals. Then he turned off the light._  
我一手扶着门，恶狠狠地咆哮道：“敢跨过这扇门一步，你就死定了。现在该让孩子们去睡觉了！”我砰地一声关上门，重复着日本人真是愚蠢，像动物一样睡在地上。然后他关掉了灯。

_

I gave Shinji the room closest to the bathroom. Actually, I didn't give the room to him, I kicked him out of _my section. His room was the closest to the bathroom because that area played an important role in the test I was about to give. I placed the two neural plugs beside my pillow where I would remember to see them in the morning. Hopefully._  
我把离浴室最近的房间给了真嗣。实际上，我不是把房间给他，而是把他从我的区域赶了出去。他的房间离浴室最近，因为那个区域在我即将进行的测试中扮演着重要角色。我把两个神经插头放在枕头旁边，以便早上记得看到它们。希望如此。

_

"Asuka... why are you doing this?" I asked myself. I didn't really expect an answer.  
“明日香...你为什么要这么做？”我自问。其实我并不期待会有答案。

Why _am I doing this, anyways? I had plenty of reasons to justify myself. The first and least important one was that we were both Evangelion pilots. If I was going to risk my life to save others, I had sure as hell better have a person I could trust defending me and watching my back. I admitted to myself that this was a bit extreme for trust, but you can't half trust a person. Maybe other can, but Sohryu Asuka Langley can't. Not when my life is in danger._  
不管怎样，我为什么要这么做呢？我有足够多的理由来为自己辩解。首先，也是最不重要的一个理由是，我们都是 EVA 驾驶员。如果我要冒着生命危险去救别人，我当然需要一个我可以信任的人来保护我，守在我身后。我承认这对信任的要求有点过分，但你不能半信半疑。也许别人可以，但惣流·明日香·兰格雷不行。尤其是在我的生命受到威胁时。

_

The second reason was to satisfy my own curiosity. A sort of experiment with the human psyche, if you want to call it that. In a gem of a class called "Sociology" in college, after performing tests all day long on unsuspecting passerby, we came up with the same conclusion. Humans are fickle, but when it comes to two things, they always act the same.  
第二个理由是为了满足我自己的好奇心。可以说是对人类心理的一种实验。在大学里有一门叫“社会学”的课程，我们在对毫无戒心的路人进行了一整天的测试后，得出了相同的结论。人类是善变的，但涉及到两件事时，他们的行为总是如出一辙。

Those two were money and sex.  
那两样东西就是金钱和性。

One experiment involved putting twenty dollars in a toilet with a piece of plastic that looked like feces. Time after time, men or female, they would always retrieve it. One fellow even tried to fish it out with a coat hanger. We slowly worked our way down from twenty, to ten, and finally to five. And yet the people were _still trying to get that money._  
其中一个实验是将二十美元放在马桶里，上面覆盖着一块看起来像粪便的塑料。无论男女，他们总是会去取回它。甚至有个人试图用衣架把它捞出来。我们逐渐从二十美元降到十美元，最后降到五美元。然而，人们仍然在努力获取那笔钱。

_

Our class came to the conclusion that people as a collective were greedy.  
我们班得出的结论是，作为集体的人类是贪婪的。

A sex experiment involved the most beautiful girl in the class (me of course) pretending to be stranded without gas on a deserted road. Every single male driver stopped for me. No, I'm not exaggerating when I say _every _single _one of them. A couple women even stopped.___  
一次性实验中，我们让班上最漂亮的女孩（当然是我）假装在一条荒无人烟的路上没油被困。每一位男性司机都停了下来。不，我并没有夸张，每一位都停了。甚至还有几位女性也停了下来。

___

Two days later, we tried the same experiment, only with one difference: I'd be wearing a sweatsuit and a baseball cap. I had to tuck all my hair into that cap, and it was prickling my ears all day. Anyways, a couple sporadic people stopped, but not with the same volume as the previous two days. I stumbled on our conclusion when I took the cap off just as a car sped by.  
两天后，我们再次尝试同样的实验，只是有一个不同之处：我会穿着运动服，戴着棒球帽。我不得不把所有头发塞进那顶帽子里，一整天耳朵都被扎得刺痛。总之，这次只有零星几个人停下来，不像前两天那样频繁。当我刚摘下帽子，一辆车疾驰而过时，我突然领悟了我们的结论。

The hair spilled over my shoulders and I instantly heard the squealing of tires. The sea blue Ford pickup raced backwards and braked in front of me, spinning gravel and debris. "Hey honey, looking for a good time?" The owner was a lazy eyed man with a boil on his lip. How in the world do you get a boil on your lip?  
发丝垂落肩头，我立刻听到了轮胎摩擦的尖锐声响。那辆海蓝色的福特皮卡疾速倒退，在我面前急刹车，扬起一片碎石和尘土。“嘿，宝贝，在找乐子吗？”车主是个眼皮懒散的男人，嘴唇上长了个脓包。天哪，你怎么会在嘴唇上长脓包？

Our class came to the conclusion that people were horny, willing to satisfy sexual pleasures first before worrying about heroism.  
我们班得出的结论是，人们都是好色的，愿意先满足性欲，再去考虑英雄主义。

That was my second reason. I really enjoyed that class. We proved that the old maxim did not apply here: "We're all the same in that we're all unique." It should be: "We're all the same in that we're all unique, except when it comes to horniness and gluttony.  
那是我的第二个理由。我真的很喜欢那门课。我们证明了那句古老的格言在这里不适用：“我们都是独一无二的。”它应该改为：“我们都是独一无二的，除了在好色和贪吃方面。”

My third reason sort of ties in with my first. I like to think of myself as a distinctive person. You don't see someone like me roaming around just anywhere. I test people's patience a lot, I'll admit. Sometimes I wonder why I can stand _myself. This being said, I make many enemies. Many of the enemies I make would take any chance to hurt me. If Shinji passes this test, I know he isn't my enemy. And I know that he can stand me for who I pretend to be._  
我的第三个理由与第一个有些关联。我喜欢认为自己是个独特的人。你不会在任何地方都能见到像我这样的人。我承认，我经常考验别人的耐心。有时我也会想，为什么我能忍受自己。话虽如此，我树敌不少。我招惹的许多敌人会抓住任何机会伤害我。如果真嗣能通过这次考验，我就知道他不是我的敌人。而且我知道，他能忍受我假装的样子。

_

_And my fourth reason...  我的第四个理由……_

_

I waited, silently, not even daring to think for fear I'd divulge something. Since we were so synchronized, did that mean we could read each others thoughts? I really hoped not.  
我静静等待，连想都不敢想，生怕泄露了什么。既然我们如此同步，那是否意味着我们能读懂彼此的心思？我真的希望不是这样。

_Asuka, let's go.  明日香，我们走吧。_

_

_I could still hear music playing very faintly through the partition. He was still awake. I stood up and took one deep breath. In one jerky movement, I threw the door open and let my eyes open slightly. I saw Shinji, pretending to be asleep. I _knew he was pretending; you know after going through this kind of training._  
我仍能透过隔板隐约听到音乐声。他还没睡。我站起身，深吸一口气。猛地一推，门开了，我微微睁开眼。看到真嗣在装睡。我知道他在装；毕竟经历了那样的训练。_

__

I walked to the bathroom and gazed at the toilet. I didn't have to go at all, but I still had to pretend I did. The bowl slurped up its contents like a porcelain maelstrom. Once I shut off the light, I could spy Shinji, still "sleeping".  
我走向浴室，盯着马桶。其实我根本不需要上厕所，但还是得装作有需要。马桶像瓷制的漩涡般吞噬了内容物。关掉灯后，我瞥见真嗣，依然“睡着”。

It was all or nothing.  
要么全有，要么全无。

I knew I could have easily gone back to my futon and went to sleep. I knew I could have turned back. No one was forcing me to do anything, but yet... when would I ever have this chance again? If Shinji did fail, what would I do? Trust Ayanami Rei in combat against Angels? Idolize Kaji even more? What would it do to our synch scores?  
我知道我可以轻易回到我的床垫上睡觉。我知道我可以转身回去。没有人强迫我做任何事，但……我何时还会有这样的机会？如果真嗣失败了，我该怎么办？在对抗使徒的战斗中信任绫波零？更加崇拜加持吗？这会对我们的同步率产生什么影响？

I didn't want to think about it. A small part of me _knew he would make it, but it did nothing to overturn the majority of me that knew he wouldn't._  
我不想去想这些。我内心的一小部分知道他会成功，但这丝毫无法改变我大部分认为他不会成功的想法。

_

Taking premeditated steps, I marched to Shinji's futon. He had his eyes closed, the faker. That small part of me now wasn't so sure that he'd make it. I dropped from my standing height to lying down, and it would have hurt like hell if I didn't know exactly how to land.  
我迈着预谋已久的步伐，走向真嗣的被褥。他闭着眼睛，装得真像。我心里那一点点现在也不那么确定他能挺过去。我从站立的高度躺下，如果不是精确知道如何着陆，那肯定会疼得要命。

His pillow smells like shampoo.  
他的枕头闻起来有洗发水的味道。

He gasped, and in doing so must have hit the backwards button on his SDAT, because I then heard a nonsensical jumble of noises. I cracked my eyes open slightly and noticed that he was staring straight at my chest. That small part of me just got blown to bits by the majority with chants of "I told you so!"  
他倒抽一口气，这一下想必是按到了 SDAT 的倒退键，因为我随即听到了一团乱七八糟的噪音。我微微睁开眼睛，注意到他正直勾勾地盯着我的胸口。我心里那一点点瞬间被大多数的“我早告诉过你”的呼声击得粉碎。

I had to stop myself from walking back to my futon. The sensible side of me argued that he was a typical male, any boy or man would do that under the circumstances. Give him another chance.  
我不得不阻止自己走回我的蒲团。理智的一面告诉我，他是个典型的男性，任何男孩或男人在这种情况下都会这么做。再给他一次机会。

I stirred and parted my lips. His attention turned from my breasts to my face, which was what I wanted him to do. Shinji looked at me for the longest time. I couldn't see anything, but I knew he was staring at me, trying to decide what to do. The test consisted of three outcomes: either he'd try to kiss me, he'd try to grope me, or he would wake me up and direct me to my futon.  
我动了动，微微张开嘴唇。他的注意力从我的胸部转移到了我的脸上，这正是我希望他做的。真嗣盯着我看了很久。我什么也看不见，但我知道他在盯着我，试图决定该怎么做。这个测试有三种结果：要么他会试图吻我，要么他会试图摸我，或者他会叫醒我，让我回到我的蒲团。

To my dismay, he went with the first option. My first kiss would be taken by a boy I had only met five days ago.  
令我沮丧的是，他选择了第一种。我的初吻将被一个我仅认识了五天的男孩夺走。

I had a plan though, as I always did. It still wasn't too late, and I didn't want to give up just yet. That Sociology class found out that people were willing to sacrifice their immediate pleasures when their conscience stopped them.  
我有一个计划，像往常一样。现在还不算太晚，我还不想放弃。那门社会学课发现，当良心阻止时，人们愿意牺牲眼前的快乐。

_And my fourth reason...  我的第四个理由……_

_

_I was sick of people referring to me as a child and treating me as such. It was this desire to grow up that sent me to college early. I condoned people who were immature, and didn't bother to hide my annoyance with such people, dismissing them as "children". My mother died when I was very young, leaving me in the care of my stepmother and real father. My stepmother didn't really care about me, and without a primary female rolemodel, I grew up rather quickly.  
我厌倦了人们把我当作孩子并如此对待我。正是这种想要长大的渴望让我提前上了大学。我容忍那些不成熟的人，并且毫不掩饰我对他们的厌烦，将他们视为“孩子”。我母亲在我很小的时候就去世了，留下我和继母以及亲生父亲生活。继母并不真正关心我，没有一位主要的女性榜样，我成长得相当迅速。_

_

My mother... my mother died of circumstances that I don't want to remember. What does it matter now, she's dead. I didn't want to sound coldhearted, but talking about things won't solve the problem. My life had gone too far ahead and my future lay in front of me. I don't like reminiscing about old times, they were all too painful to remember.  
我的母亲……她因一些我不想回忆的情况去世了。现在说这些有什么用，她已经不在了。我不想显得冷酷无情，但谈论这些并不能解决问题。我的生活已经走得太远，我的未来就在眼前。我不喜欢回忆过去，那些记忆都太过痛苦。

I never became tired of being an adult... but at times I still longed to be a child. I would look into the night sky and wonder, where would I be right now if I didn't grow up so quickly? Where would I be if I wasn't an Evangelion pilot? Where would I be... if mama never died?  
我从未厌倦过成人的身份...但有时我仍渴望回到童年。我会仰望夜空，思索着，如果我没有那么快长大，我现在会在哪里？如果不是作为 EVA 驾驶员，我又会在哪里？如果妈妈没有去世，我又会在哪里？

_And my fourth reason is...  
而我的第四个理由是..._

_

The scent of Shinji's hair and his heat drew closer and closer to my face. I didn't pull away, instead feeling myself trapped in a pocket of time, unable to pull away.  
真嗣头发的香气和他身上的温暖越来越近地贴近我的脸庞。我没有退缩，反而感觉自己被困在了一个时间的小口袋里，无法挣脱。

_Where would I be if mama never died?  
如果妈妈从未离世，我又会在何方？_

_

I never really wanted the life that I was now leading. Being an adult had so many responsibilities. Not that I couldn't handle them, but I also missed the carefree days of being a child and staring at things with breathless wonder. Now whenever something fascinated me, I had to pretend not to care.  
我从未真正渴望过如今所过的生活。成年人的世界责任重重。并非我无法应对，只是我怀念孩童时期的无忧无虑，以及对万物充满惊奇的凝视。如今，每当有什么事物令我着迷，我却不得不假装漠不关心。

Now I had to be heartless, pretending I wasn't hurt when someone threw an insult at me. Even compliments from people felt hollow, this wasn't really me. It was only a shell of me with something buried inside, desperate for freedom. I was slowly killing myself... and I don't want to die.  
现在我必须变得无情，当有人出言侮辱时，假装不以为意。即便是他人的赞美也显得空洞，这并非真正的我。我只是个外壳，内里埋藏着渴望自由的灵魂。我正慢慢扼杀自己……而我不想死去。

I miss my inner child.  
我想念内心的孩子。

I miss my freedom.  
我想念我的自由。

But most of all, I miss my mother.  
但最让我想念的，是我的母亲。

"Ma... ma..." I whispered hoarsely. "Mama..."  
“妈... 妈...” 我嘶哑地低语，“妈妈...”

To my horror, I felt tears well up in my eyes and get caught in my eyelashes. It took every bit of me to keep from sobbing. I only planned to call out her name, but this was... this was too much.  
令我惊恐的是，我感到泪水涌上眼眶，卡在睫毛间。我竭尽全力才忍住不哭出声。我本只想呼唤她的名字，但这一切... 这一切太过沉重。

Mere millimeters from my lips, Ikari Shinji stopped his own.  
仅差毫厘便触到我的唇，碇真嗣停住了自己的动作。

Shinji must have held that position for what seemed like hours. If he had advanced any further, I would have burst out crying. I sniffled once, not being able to help myself. The heat instantly withdrew from my face and the dominant scent of chamomile lessened.  
真嗣一定保持着那个姿势，仿佛过了好几个小时。如果他再进一步，我恐怕会忍不住哭出来。我吸了吸鼻子，无法自控。脸上的热度立刻消退，洋甘菊的浓郁香气也减弱了。

_He's backing away.  他在退缩。_

_

I felt Shinji sit up on the futon, pause, and then stand up. I heard a shuffle on the other side of the room behind me, and then a rustling.  
我感觉真嗣从被褥上坐起来，停顿了一下，然后站起身。我听到房间另一边身后传来一阵窸窣声，接着是沙沙声。

_What is he... what is he doing?  
他在...他在做什么？_

_

Once I composed and scolded myself for getting out of control, I flipped over and saw exactly what Shinji had done. He transferred himself to my bed and gave this one to me. I cracked my eyes open, but they were still blurry with tears. But I didn't have to see him to hear what he said next.  
我曾为自己失控而自责，翻过身来，正好看到真嗣做了什么。他把自己移到了我的床上，把这张床让给了我。我勉强睁开眼睛，但泪水仍让视线模糊。不过，我无需看到他也能听到他接下来所说的话。

"You're just a child yourself." He threw the blankets over his head and didn't come back out for the remainder of the night.  
“你自己也还是个孩子。”他把被子蒙在头上，整晚都没有再露面。

Finally. After all this time... someone finally understood _me. It takes a special person to see behind the mask, the mask I show to others. The one I've been wearing for every day of my life. I didn't want someone who saw the arrogance or the superiority. I wanted them to look past the beauty and see the birthmark. The scar. The blemish._  
终于。这么长时间以来……终于有人理解我了。能看穿面具的人，都是特别的人，那面具是我展示给他人的。那张我一生中每一天都戴着的面具。我不需要那些看到傲慢或优越感的人。我希望他们能透过美丽的外表，看到那块胎记。那道疤痕。那个瑕疵。

_

Not the child who pretended to be an adult, but the adult that ached to be a child.  
不是那个假装成大人的孩子，而是那个渴望成为孩子的成年人。

Congratulations Ikari Shinji. You are not a coward, because any coward would have gone ahead and kissed me regardless of my emotions. You defied the odds and my own thinking. Maybe I didn't have to give you a spine after all.  
恭喜碇真嗣。你不是懦夫，因為任何懦夫都會不顧我的感受直接吻我。你打破了常規，也顛覆了我的想法。或許我根本不必給你勇氣。

_You had one all along. A complete one, and not just fragments of it.  
你一直都有。一個完整的，而不僅僅是碎片。_

_

A sliver of moonlight pierced the room and shone on a piece of tacked up paper, one by the bathroom door. It was too far away for me to see, but I already knew what it said. I had circled it myself. In big bold letters:  
一縷月光穿透房間，照在浴室門旁釘著的一張紙上。距離太遠我看不清，但我已經知道上面寫了什麼。那是我親手圈出來的，用大大的粗體字：

**Tomorrow is D-Day.  明天是 D-Day。**

**

**I never slept with a smile on my face before until now.  
我从未在睡梦中带着微笑，直到现在。**

### Chapter 7

**Today is D-Day.  今天是 D 日。**

**As soon as I woke up, Misato whirled us into her beaten up car and spirited us to NERV headquarters. I think we were about halfway there before I realized that I wasn't in my futon anymore. Misato chattered on and on about something I didn't care to listen to, like she had drunk an undue amount of coffee this morning.  
我一醒来，美里就急匆匆地把我们塞进她那辆破旧的车里，带我们直奔 NERV 总部。我想我们大概走了一半路程，我才意识到自己已经不在被窝里了。美里喋喋不休地说着一些我懒得听的事情，好像她今早喝多了咖啡似的。**

**

In the car, I readjusted my eyes to the light and saw Shinji sitting in the front seat. I had the back all to myself and was lying down. Once I saw that we had gone into the tunnel leading to headquarters, I sat up. "How much time do we have to defeat this Angel?"  
在车里，我重新适应了光线，看到真嗣坐在前排。后排只有我一个人，我正躺着。一看到我们进入了通往总部的隧道，我就坐了起来。“我们还有多少时间来击败这个使徒？”

Shinji jumped in his seat as if a firecracker had gone off next to his ear. He turned around and stared at me. "Good morning, Asuka," he finally said. Then he turned back and faced the front.  
真嗣像被鞭炮炸到耳朵一样猛地一跳。他转过身来盯着我。“早上好，明日香。”他终于说道。然后他又转回去，面向前方。

"You too..." I didn't know what to say.  
"你也是..." 我不知道该说什么。

"Actually," Misato corrected, "It's a great afternoon." We careened to avoid a slower Toyota .  
"实际上，" 美里纠正道，"这是一个美好的下午。" 我们急转避开一辆行驶较慢的丰田车。

"Afternoon!" If I wasn't awake before, I was awake now. "Already?!"  
"下午了！" 如果我之前还没醒，那我现在醒了。"已经下午了？！"

Misato nodded, driving the car in excess of 70 MPH. I didn't want her to talk anymore, it was like driving and talking were in the same area of the brain. If she did one, she couldn't do the other. I would prefer to have my body extracted from the remains of my Eva than charred to a crisp in Misato's hunk of junk.  
美里点点头，车速超过了 70 英里每小时。我不想让她再说话了，感觉开车和说话占据了大脑的同一区域。她做一件事，就无法兼顾另一件。我宁愿从我的 EVA 残骸中被解救出来，也不愿在美里的破车上被烧成焦炭。

"Yes... I couldn't wake you up yet because I wanted to see if you were truly synchronized. Neither of you woke up at 7:00 ... and you both finally opened your eyes within five minutes of each other." She looked at her watch and I felt the car losing control. "That was eight minutes ago. Shinji opened his eyes and woke up, but you opened your eyes and went back to sleep."  
“是的……我还没叫醒你是因为我想看看你们是否真的同步了。你们俩都没在 7 点醒来……最终你们在五分钟内相继睁开了眼睛。”她看了看手表，我感觉车子开始失控。“那是八分钟前的事了。真嗣睁开眼睛醒了，但你睁开眼睛后又睡着了。”

Shinji turned around and admitted that they carried me to the car. I couldn't believe they could do that and I didn't feel anything... or even resist. I screamed at him, saying my neural plugs were beside the futon. I threatened to dismember him if he left those behind. He stammered that he picked them up and held them out in his hand. "H-Here."  
真嗣转过身来承认是他们把我抬到车上的。我难以置信他们能做到这一点，而我却毫无感觉……甚至没有反抗。我对他大喊，说我的神经插头在床垫旁边。我威胁说如果他丢下那些东西，我会把他撕成碎片。他结结巴巴地说他已经捡起来了，并把手伸出来给我看。“在、在这里。”

I snatched them and slid them in my hair. "Do you need a brush, Asuka?"  
我一把抓过它们，插进头发里。“你需要梳子吗，明日香？”

"And what's the supposed to mean, Misato?!" I asked, insulted.  
“那是什么意思，美里？！”我感到被冒犯，问道。

"Nothing." “没什么。”

Once we got to headquarters, Ritsuko informed us that the Angel was starting to stir. Within an hour, it would be fully mobile. She told us that we could take this hour to synchronize and "do whatever it is you do". She steered us to the locker room as if we didn't know where it was. Then Ritsuko left us there, plugsuits in hand and staring blankly after her.  
一到总部，律子就告诉我们使徒开始有所动作了。不出一小时，它就会完全活动起来。她告诉我们，可以利用这一小时进行同步，并“做你们该做的事”。她领我们走向更衣室，仿佛我们不知道它在哪儿似的。随后律子把我们留在那里，手里拿着插入栓服，茫然地目送她离去。

_Now... what just happened?  
现在...刚刚发生了什么？_

_

I glared at Shinji's duffel bag. "You know, if you woke me up instead of hauling me to the car like a sack of potatoes, I could have gotten my duffel bag too."  
我瞪着真嗣的旅行袋。“你知道吗，如果你不是像扛土豆袋一样把我拽上车，而是叫醒我，我也能拿到我的旅行袋。”

"Uh, sorry..." "呃，抱歉..."

"Look at me!" I commanded. He did so, but then he started to blush. I was dressed in my sleeping clothes, certainly not tasteful attire to wear outside. "You paraded me throughout all of Tokyo-3 looking like this!"  
"看着我！" 我命令道。他照做了，但随即开始脸红。我穿着睡衣，当然不是适合外出的打扮。"你这样带着我在整个第三新东京市转了一圈！"

"I already said I'm sorry!"  
"我已经说过对不起了！"

I teased him. "Say, did you like touching me when you put me on the backseat of the car? Were you the one who insisted on it?"  
我逗他：“说起来，你把我放到车后座时喜欢摸我吗？是不是你坚持要这么做的？”

"N-No!" he exclaimed. "Misato told me to put you in there!"  
"不，不！" 他惊呼道，"美里告诉我把你放进去的！"

"Oh..." I nudged him. "Then you didn't complain, did you? Did you?!"  
"哦..." 我轻轻推了他一下，"那你没抱怨，对吧？你抱怨了吗？！"

I was determined to make it hard on him, but not too hard. When he didn't answer, I shoved him to the curtain separating the two locker rooms. "And let that be the last time you ever step in our room!"  
我决心让他吃点苦头，但也不能太过。见他没有回答，我一把将他推到分隔两个更衣室的帘子前。"以后别再踏进我们的房间了！"

"Sorry! Ritsuko put me in there, you know!"  
"对不起！律子把我关在那里的，你知道的！"

"Whatever." I waved my hand although I knew he couldn't see it and started to take off what little clothing I had. "Just think about what we're going to do, okay?"  
"随你吧。"" 我挥了挥手，尽管我知道他看不见，然后开始脱掉身上仅有的几件衣物。""只想想要做的事，好吗？"

"Fine." "好吧。"

We took quite some time getting into our plugsuits, during which neither of us said a word. The only sounds I could hear were breathing in my head and the rubber squeaking of the suits as it rubbed against my skin. Once, I heard Shinji unzip his bag.  
我们花了相当长的时间穿上插入栓服，期间我们俩谁也没说一句话。我能听到的只有脑海中的呼吸声和橡胶服摩擦皮肤的吱吱声。有一次，我听到真嗣拉开了他的包。

"You know, if you would have woken me up sooner, I could have packed some shampoo and a towel." I looked over my clothing with aversion. I hope Misato had some extra clothes or something in her trunk, because I wasn't leaving here wearing my bedclothes.  
“你知道吗，如果你早点叫醒我，我就能带上洗发水和毛巾了。”我厌恶地看着我的衣服。希望美里在后备箱里有些多余的衣服或什么的，因为我可不想穿着睡衣离开这里。

Shinji's shadow was by the curtain again, giving me an odd feeling of déjà vu. I trusted him that he wouldn't just throw open the curtain to ogle at me. I sighed. "That damn yellow liquid dries in my hair and makes it crusty. Stupid Shinji."  
真嗣的影子又出现在窗帘旁，给我一种奇怪的似曾相识的感觉。我相信他不会突然拉开窗帘来偷看我。我叹了口气。“那该死的黄色液体弄得我头发都干了，还结了硬壳。真是个笨蛋真嗣。”

He didn't say he was sorry. Instead, he said that he was going to the cages. Then he disappeared from the curtain. Seeing that my complaining wasn't going to get me anywhere, I rearranged the clips in my hair and walked out.  
他没说对不起。相反，他说要去笼子那边。然后他就从帘子后面消失了。看到抱怨无济于事，我重新整理了发夹，走了出去。

_Asuka, let's go.  明日香，我们走吧。_

_

On the way there, my heart shattered in two when I saw Kaji walking down the hall. With Misato. She was obviously doing her best to ignore him, but I know that it's impossible to ignore Kaji. Disregarding all the feelings that coursed through me as I saw them, I did the thing I always did.  
在去那里的路上，当我看到加持在走廊上走着，身边是美里时，我的心碎成了两半。她显然在尽力忽视他，但我知道无视加持是不可能的。无视看到他们时涌上心头的所有情感，我做了我一贯做的事。

"Kaji! Hi!!" "加治！嗨！！"

I ran up and threw my arms around him. Kaji felt rigid, and then relaxed into my embrace and hugged me back. His arms made me feel so content. "And here's the most beautiful girl in Tokyo-3."  
我跑上前去，张开双臂抱住了他。加治起初身体僵硬，随后放松下来，回抱了我。他的臂膀让我感到无比安心。“还有东京-3 最美丽的女孩。”

My heart stung. Wasn't I a woman? No wait, I already know who he thinks the most beautiful woman is. I slapped on a cheesy smile although I was crying inside. "Are you going to watch me?"  
我的心刺痛了一下。难道我不是女人吗？不，等等，我已经知道他认为谁是最美丽的女人了。尽管内心在哭泣，我还是强装出一个俗气的笑容。“你会来看我吗？”

He smiled. "I'm going to watch both of you."  
他微笑道：“我会看着你们俩的。”

"By the way, where is Shinji?"  
“顺便问一下，真嗣在哪儿？”

I shrugged at Misato. "He said he was going to the cages already."  
我向美里耸了耸肩。“他说他要去笼子那边了。”

She looked at me sternly. "Then you should be up there too."  
她严肃地看着我。“那你也应该在那里。”

I told her not to worry about us and that we had it all under control. Kaji slid an arm around Misato's waist and said that she was always so uptight. She shoved him away, but I saw what he didn't. The small nuances a woman had when she enjoyed the attention but didn't want it. They were written all over her face.  
我告诉她不用担心我们，一切都在掌控之中。加持搂住美里腰间，说她是总是那么紧张。她推开他，但我看到了他没注意到的地方。当一个女人享受关注又不愿表现出来时，那些细微的表情变化，全都写在她脸上。

"I have to kick some Angel ass. I'll be back soon!"  
“我得去教训那些使徒。很快回来！”

Kaji waved back at me. "Good luck!"  
加治向我挥手回应。“祝你好运！”

I turned around and headed to the cages with a shattered heart. I knew that there was no other option than to keep on loving Kaji. To stop abruptly would mean that I made a mistake in the first place, and I don't make mistakes. He would never look at me in the way that lovers do. Was I content with just his hugs and smiles?  
我转过身，心碎地走向笼子。我知道除了继续爱着加治，别无选择。突然停止意味着我一开始就错了，而我从不犯错。他永远不会用恋人的眼神看我。我满足于仅仅他的拥抱和微笑吗？

_I would have to be.  
我只能如此。_

_

I got up to the first level and looked around for Shinji. There was no sign of him. Evangelion 02's luminous eyes stared down at me, unseeing and lifeless. Then I looked at Shinji's, the test type Evangelion 01. I briefly wondered why all these dolls looked different. Why did the armor look different? Aesthetical reason?  
我爬到了第一层，四处寻找真嗣。却不见他的踪影。二号机那双发光的眼睛居高临下地盯着我，空洞而无生气。接着我看向真嗣的，试验型初号机。我短暂地疑惑为何这些机甲看起来各不相同。为何装甲的外观也不同？是出于审美原因吗？

I snorted, there's no way NERV would blow money on making the Evangelions look good.  
我嗤之以鼻，NERV 绝不可能为了美化使徒而浪费资金。

Someone told me to get in my cockpit already, "You're late!" I grudgingly climbed up the mecha's side and slid into the LCL. I could almost feel my crinkly and unshampooed hair now... but while floating in the liquid, it felt soft and wavy. After closing my eyes to find that burst of fire that was synchronization, the Eva sputtered to life.  
有人催促我赶紧进入驾驶舱，“你迟到了！”我心不甘情不愿地攀上机甲侧面，滑入 LCL 中。我几乎能感受到自己那干枯未洗的头发此刻...但在液体中漂浮时，它却变得柔软而有弹性。闭上眼寻找那同步瞬间的火花后，Eva 便颤抖着启动了。

I turned on the commlink and said, "Shinji? Are you there yet?" There was no answer from his Eva. In fact, the cockpit was empty. "Hey!" Didn't he say he was already up here?  
"我打开了通讯链接，问道：“真嗣？你到了吗？”他的 EVA 没有回应。实际上，驾驶舱是空的。“嘿！”他不是说他已经上来了吗？”

Not half a minute later, I saw him submerge himself in LCL and close his eyes. The lights from the Evangelion's activation cast a soft glow on his face. I thought he was sleeping. "Where have you been?"  
"不到半分钟后，我看到他浸入 LCL 并闭上了眼睛。EVA 启动时的灯光在他脸上投下柔和的光芒。我以为他在睡觉。“你去哪儿了？””

He opened his eyes and looked at me. "I had—"  
"他睁开眼睛看着我。“我刚才——””

Misato's voice immediately overrode his. "The Angel is moving around Sasuga Bay and has reached land. We're sending you up right shortly, so be prepared."  
美里立刻打断了他的话。“使徒正在龙嵩湾一带移动，并且已经登陆。我们马上派你出击，做好准备。”

I took in a deep breath. LCL was no substitute for oxygen. For one thing, oxygen didn't smell. For another, too much of it didn't turn your hair lighter.  
我深吸了一口气。LCL 无法替代氧气。首先，氧气没有气味。其次，过多的氧气不会让你的头发变浅。

"Are you ready to do this?" Shinji asked softly.  
“你准备好这么做吗？”真嗣轻声问道。

I gave him a confident smirk. "Of course, we'll beat this thing easily. After all, you're with the best."  
我给了他一个自信的冷笑。“当然，我们会轻松击败这东西。毕竟，你可是和最棒的一起。”

"That's right." “没错。”

A man's voice came over the commlink. "The target has entered the mountains." I could hear assorted voices talking in the background.  
一个男人的声音通过通讯器传来。“目标已进入山区。”我还能听到背景中各种声音的交谈。

_Damn, this thing was fast...  
该死，这东西真快..._

_

We were going to beat this Angel. I wanted to make sure of it. "Just remember Shinji, full power, maximum performance." As the people in Germany would say, I got my drinking contest face on.  
我们要打败这只使徒。我一定要确保这一点。“记住，真嗣，全力出击，最高性能。”就像德国人说的，我摆出了拼酒的架势。

"I know that. We'll finish in sixty-two seconds."  
“我知道。我们将在六十二秒内完成。”

I heard the same man's voice again. "The target has entered Ground Zero."  
我又听到了那个男人的声音。“目标已进入零点地带。”

"Detach the external power cables... and launch." The giant countdown materialized over my head and I felt the ground move up from under me. Within seconds, I was flying through the air and looking down at Israfel. The Seventh Angel.  
“断开外部电源电缆……然后发射。”巨大的倒计时在我头顶显现，我感觉到地面从脚下升起。几秒钟内，我便飞向空中，俯视着伊斯拉斐尔。第七使徒。

"You take the right!" shouted Shinji. "I've got the left."  
“你走右边！”真嗣喊道。“我走左边。”

Our objective was to keep the force the Angel to separate and come back together again. The computers in Dogma calculated that once it separated and was forced back together again, two blows from two Evas at the same time would knock out both sides, therefore destroying it.  
我们的目标是迫使使徒分离后再使其重新聚合。Dogma 的计算机计算出，一旦使徒分离并被迫重新聚合，两台 EVA 同时发动两次攻击将能击溃其两侧，从而将其摧毁。

We did a rotation in the air and grabbed our especially designed spears on our backs. "Got it!" Shinji and I threw them down, and the two spears formed an AT field between them. Our aim flew true and it divided the Angel in half just as we crashed to the ground.  
我们在空中旋转并抓住了背上特制的矛。“抓住了！”真嗣和我将矛投下，两支矛之间形成了 AT 力场。我们的目标准确无误，使徒被一分为二，就在我们坠地的同时。

"Shinji! Asuka! Get the guns!"  
“真嗣！明日香！拿枪！”

Time flew by rather quickly from there. I remember firing, dodging, twisting, contorting, shooting, doing backflips... when the two halves avoided our bullets, I heard Misato faintly order that a barrage of missiles be fired. Within seconds a vortex or fire slammed into the Angel.  
时间从那时起飞逝得相当快。我记得开火、闪避、旋转、扭曲、射击、做后空翻……当两半避开我们的子弹时，我隐约听到美里下令发射一连串导弹。几秒钟内，一团火焰旋涡猛烈撞击了使徒。

_25 seconds.  25 秒。_

_

"Now!" we both cried. I started to yell, all the savageness and fury exploding in one long breath. I heard Shinji shout as we spun around and kicked the two halves together.  
“现在！”我们齐声喊道。我开始咆哮，所有的野蛮和愤怒在一口长气中爆发。我听到真嗣的喊声，我们旋转着将两半踢在一起。

I grinned in a split second of brief triumph. "Let's finish him off!"  
我瞬间咧嘴一笑，短暂胜利的喜悦一闪而过。“让我们终结他！”

_13 seconds.  13 秒。_

_

Both Evas catapulted into the air and I had that sensation that I was flying again. On pure instinct, I whirled along side Unit 01, our feet coming together for a final blow. It connected with the two S2 orbs of the Angel with three seconds to go.  
两台 EVA 同时冲向空中，我又有了那种飞翔的感觉。纯粹凭着本能，我与零一号机并肩旋转，我们的脚汇聚力量，准备给予最后一击。在倒计时三秒时，这一击准确命中了天使的两个 S2 核心。

With two seconds left, I saw the red globe crack.  
仅剩两秒时，我目睹了那颗红色球体裂开。

_Time's up.  时间到。_

_

An explosion that made my ears ring with the fury of all hell swallowed the earth and sent it careening to the sun. I felt something slam into me from my side and I smashed into the ground, knocking all the air out of me as though someone punched me in the stomach.  
一场爆炸，其威力之大仿佛地狱的怒火，吞噬了大地，将其推向太阳。我感到侧面一股力量猛击而来，随即重重摔在地上，仿佛被人一拳打在肚子上，一口气全被挤了出来。

"Con... tion... Eva... perational..."  
"控... 制... 零... 运作..."

Endless day turned into black night as the Eva's power supply finally ran out. We did it! I must have lain there in that cockpit, celebrating on how awesome Shinji and I were to finish off that monstrosity.  
无尽的白昼终于在 Eva 的能量耗尽后化作漆黑的夜晚。我们做到了！我一定是在驾驶舱里躺着，庆祝着我和真嗣是多么了不起，终于干掉了那个怪物。

_Shinji... and I?  真嗣... 和我？_

_

I gasped. It took a wimpy boy to snap me out of my feelings of superiority?! I lost it already? Well... we'd see about that.  
我倒吸一口凉气。居然是一个懦弱的男孩让我从优越感中清醒过来？！我已经输了吗？好吧...我们走着瞧。

Once I saw Shinji crawling around on the outside of that Eva, I called him up on a telephone. Odd how they put those things on an Eva in the first place... but oh well. I demanded what in the world he was doing on my Unit. He shot back that I was the one who fell on him. I looked down and saw that in fact, my Eva was on top of his.  
当我看到真嗣在那台 Eva 外壳上爬行时，我通过电话联系了他。奇怪的是，他们竟然把那种东西装在 Eva 上...不过算了。我质问他到底在我的机体上做什么。他反驳说是我先压在他身上的。我低头一看，果然，我的 Eva 正压在他的上面。

Well dammit! 该死！

"You're the one who lost your timing first! What the hell were you doing, staying up so late last night!"  
"你才是先乱了节奏的那个！昨晚你到底在干嘛，那么晚还不睡！"

Of course, I already knew the answer to this. But it wouldn't hurt to have a little bit of fun with him; we were the only ones who knew.  
当然，我早已知道答案。但逗逗他也不失为一种乐趣；毕竟只有我们俩知道。

He sputtered. "I... I was image training! Image training for today's battle!"  
他结巴起来。""我...我在进行形象训练！为了今天的战斗做形象训练！"

I narrowed my eyes suspiciously. Image training? What a horrible excuse! "You liar... I know you tried to kiss me in my sleep!"  
我怀疑地眯起眼睛。影像训练？多么糟糕的借口！“你这个骗子……我知道你趁我睡着时想亲我！”

What now, Ikari Shinji? Come up with another weak excuse like image training? Or tell the truth? Or...  
现在怎么办，碇真嗣？再编一个像影像训练这样蹩脚的借口？还是说实话？或者……

"You... you cheated! You were awake?" His voice was one of disbelief.  
“你……你作弊了！你当时醒着？”他的声音充满了难以置信。

Yes, I was awake. I know everything, Shinji, but damned if I showed it. "Oh my God!" I screamed. "I was just kidding!! Did you really kiss me in my sleep?!"  
是的，我醒着。我什么都知道，真嗣，但该死的我就是装作不知道。“我的天哪！”我尖叫道，“我只是在开玩笑！！你真的在我睡着时吻了我吗？！”

I shouldn't have said that. The conversation was being broadcast all over Tokyo-3, and if he admitted that he kissed me (although he didn't), he would go down in history as the only boy that Sohryu Asuka Langley got really close to.  
我不该说那句话的。对话正在整个第三新东京市广播，如果他承认吻了我（虽然他没有），他将成为历史上唯一一个与惣流·明日香·兰格雷真正亲近的男孩。

Shinji's voice grew slightly quieter, obviously aware of everyone watching him. "N-No! I... I stopped!"  
真嗣的声音稍微变小了，显然意识到所有人都在看着他。“不，不！我……我停下了！”

Then I let loose a long string of curses and tried to hit him on the head. I didn't think that a hologram could hurt anyone physically, but was I was wrong. I heard laughter in the background, no doubt from the personnel on the bridge. Truth was, although I had a scowl on my face, I was having fun too.  
然后我爆发出一连串的咒骂，试图朝他头上打去。我本以为全息影像无法对人造成物理伤害，但我错了。背景中传来笑声，毫无疑问是舰桥上的工作人员。事实上，尽管我脸上带着怒容，其实我也玩得很开心。

*****

After the laughter died, an airplane carrier picked us up and took us back to headquarters. I refused to look at Shinji, pretending I was still angry. I would act this way for a while, just to salvage my dignity. I don't know what it is about me, but somehow I wanted to make a fool out of him to see how he would deal with that. I thought he learned his lesson on trying to argue with me, but apparently not.  
笑声平息后，一艘航空母舰接走了我们，带我们返回总部。我拒绝看向真嗣，假装还在生气。我会这样装一会儿，只是为了挽回我的尊严。我不知道自己是怎么了，但不知为何，我想让他出丑，看看他会如何应对。我以为他在试图与我争论这件事上已经吸取了教训，但显然没有。

As soon as I stepped off that launch pad, I felt my hair with a scowl. Not only that, but I was cold, I smelled, and my skin felt like it didn't belong on me. I would be looking forward to take a shower but those damn towels...  
我一踏出发射台，就皱着眉头摸了摸头发。不仅如此，我还感到寒冷，身上有异味，皮肤感觉像是长错了地方。我期待着洗个澡，但那些该死的毛巾……

"Congratulations, pilots. You were excellent."  
"祝贺你们，驾驶员们。你们表现得非常出色。"

Shinji and I didn't say anything to Ritsuko's praise. I was going to brag about how wonderful I was, but I decided against it. I wanted to wash myself as soon as possible.  
对于律子的夸奖，我和真嗣都没有回应。我本想炫耀一下自己有多棒，但还是决定算了。我只想尽快洗个澡。

"Shinji! Asuka!" Misato waved at us as she came running down. Despite our smelliness, she took both of us into a giant hug and swept us off our feet. "You guys did so well!"  
"真嗣！明日香！""美里一边向我们跑来一边挥手。尽管我们身上气味难闻，她还是紧紧抱住了我们，把我们抱离了地面。""你们做得太棒了！"

"T-Thank you..." “谢……谢谢你……”

"Of course we did."  
“当然我们做到了。”

Even Kaji appeared from behind Misato, giving Shinji a manly shake of the hand and putting his arm around my shoulder. My hair crackled to his touch like brittle fire. "Way to go. But if I were you..." he winked at Shinji, "I would have went on and done it anyways."  
就连加持也从美里身后出现，给真嗣来了个男子汉式的握手，并把手臂搭在我的肩上。我的头发在他触碰下噼啪作响，如同易碎的火焰。“干得漂亮。但如果是我的话……”他朝真嗣眨了眨眼，“无论如何都会继续做下去的。”

I crossed my arms.  
我交叉双臂。

_Yeah right.  得了吧。_

_

I removed Kaji's arm from my shoulder and said sweetly that as much as I liked to be around him, I needed to take a shower. He said that pretty girls should smell good, but I was an exception. I rolled my eyes and walked off with Shinji following close behind me.  
我把加持的手臂从肩膀上移开，甜甜地说，虽然我很喜欢待在他身边，但我需要洗个澡。他说漂亮女孩应该闻起来香香的，但我是个例外。我翻了个白眼，走开了，真嗣紧跟在我后面。

I walked into the elevator that would take us to the ground level and stepped inside. Shinji did the same. After everyone congratulating us on our success, there was still one other person to congratulate.  
我走进电梯，它会带我们到地面层，然后踏了进去。真嗣也跟着进来了。在大家祝贺我们成功之后，还有一个人要祝贺。

Each other. 彼此。

"We did—" "我们确实——"

"Hey Shinji—" "嘿，真嗣——"

The raspy grating of the elevator sliding down its track cut us both short when we tried to talk. We both looked at each other, and then quickly looked away. Why was I acting like such a schoolgirl? "Listen here Third, I hope you won't be taking advantage of me again in my sleep."  
电梯沿着轨道下滑的刺耳摩擦声打断了我们试图进行的对话。我们俩对视了一眼，然后迅速移开了目光。我为什么要表现得像个女学生一样？“听着，三笠，我希望你不会再趁我睡着时占我便宜。”

I expected an answer, but he gave none. The point was painfully clear that he could have done whatever he wanted, and it was comforting that he didn't gloat over it. We really didn't say anything else until the elevator squealed to a halt and the doors creaked open. Once I stepped outside, he was to go to the left and I was to the right. "By the way, nice job Shinji."  
我期待着他的回答，但他没有回应。这一点痛苦地表明，他本可以为所欲为，而他没有因此得意洋洋，这让人感到些许安慰。我们直到电梯尖叫着停下，门吱吱作响地打开，才再没说别的。一踏出电梯，他向左走，我向右走。“顺便说一句，干得不错，真嗣。”

Shinji turned to face me, a curious expression on his face. He blinked, and then smiled at me. "It's because I was with the best."  
真嗣转过身来面对我，脸上带着好奇的表情。他眨了眨眼，然后对我微笑。“那是因为我和最棒的人在一起。”

"Damn straight." “当然没错。”

I turned around and confidently sauntered to the locker room; that boy certainly knew how to make me feel important.  
我转过身，自信地走向更衣室；那男孩确实懂得如何让我感觉自己很重要。

Ikari Shinji. The Third Child.  
碇真嗣。第三适格者。

I think he was starting to grow on me. He's a welcome change from all the hounding college boys, I guess. Still, I wouldn't change my outward opinion of him. He'd remain the spineless, cowardly, and inferior to me. But inside... I knew that he had surpassed all my expectations.  
我觉得他开始让我有点动心了。比起那些纠缠不休的大学生，他算是个受欢迎的改变吧。不过，我对外表的看法不会改变。他依旧是无胆、懦弱且不如我的。但在内心深处……我知道他已经超出了我的所有预期。

_Congratulations Shinji.  恭喜你，真嗣。_

_

When I stepped into the locker room, I saw a shadow move behind the partially open curtain. I swear I caught a glance of short brown hair. On the bench where my nightgown was lay a complete change of clothing, neatly folded. Beside it was a familiar pink towel, freshly laundered and soft to the touch. Lying on top, a new, unopened bottle of Misato's shampoo, gleaming amber against the pink.  
当我走进更衣室时，我看到一个影子在半开的帘子后移动。我发誓我瞥见了一头短短的棕发。我的睡衣所在的凳子上，整齐地叠放着一套全新的换洗衣物。旁边是一条熟悉的粉色毛巾，刚洗过，触感柔软。上面放着一瓶未开封的 Misato 的洗发水，在粉色的映衬下闪耀着琥珀色。

I looked at the curtain separating the two locker rooms.  
我看着那道分隔两个更衣室的帘子。

And I wondered. 我思索着。

**The End  剧终**

Author's notes: This is the fastest I've ever completed a fiction, Rurouni Kenshin or otherwise. I know the idea probably isn't original, but I hope I put a new spin on it. Thank you again to Blue Taboo. Also, thanks to Ghola, Reizig, and Rev'd for reviewing my story and giving me helpful suggestions. I love you guys, but in a purely platonic way, of course =) Lastly, Lord Deathscythe for letting me step foot inside darkscribes.org and making me a Dark Lady. Site is at darkscribes.org The second round of Takoballs voting is up, and there's lots of goodness at the forums and the Fanfic Yakuza reside here, so be off with you and get thee to the site!  
作者的话：这是我完成得最快的一篇小说，无论是《浪客剑心》还是其他作品。我知道这个想法可能并不新颖，但我希望我能给它带来新的视角。再次感谢 Blue Taboo。同时，感谢 Ghola、Reizig 和 Rev'd 审阅我的故事并给予我有益的建议。我爱你们，当然，是以一种纯粹的友谊方式=)最后，感谢 Lord Deathscythe 让我踏入 darkscribes.org 并成为一位黑暗女士。网站地址是 darkscribes.org。第二轮 Takoballs 投票已经开始，论坛上有许多精彩内容，Fanfic Yakuza 也在这里，快去网站看看吧！

I've grown to like Asuka a lot more than I already did. My next project has already been narrowed down to two ideas, one's an epic and the other is similar to this one. Methinks I'll do the latter first, so expect ol' Karina's name next to a Shinji/Asuka fic sometime in the very near future.  
我对明日香的好感已经比之前更甚。我的下一个项目已经缩小到两个想法，一个是史诗级的，另一个与此类似。我想我会先做后者，所以期待不久的将来在碇真嗣/明日香同人文旁边看到 Karina 的名字。

Until later... keep on writing!  
下次见...继续写作吧！
