All she saw was his weakness.  
她看到的只是他的软弱。

...(中间内容没有保留)

Kaji dropped her off as the sun dipped below the mountains fencing Tokyo-3. He declined Shinji's invitation to join them for supper. He declined Asuka's pleaded demand. He wriggled from her grasp and slipped out the door.  
当太阳沉入环绕第三新东京市的群山时，加持把她送到了家。他婉拒了真嗣共进晚餐的邀请，也拒绝了明日香恳求的要求。他从她的手中挣脱，悄悄离开了门。

"It's just us tonight," Shinji said from the kitchen. "Ms. Misato's working late again."  
"今晚就我们俩了，" 真嗣从厨房说道。"美里小姐又加班到很晚。"

Asuka kicked off her shoes and stomped into the apartment, stopping at the threshold of the kitchen. Shinji was at the sink, doing the day's dishes before starting dinner. He was in his apron, forearms under a bubbly white landscape of foam. The clatter of dishware hiccupped through the room.  
明日香踢掉鞋子，跺着脚走进公寓，停在厨房门口。真嗣正在水槽边洗着当天的碗碟，准备开始做晚饭。他系着围裙，前臂浸在泡沫翻滚的白色世界中。碗碟的碰撞声断断续续地传遍房间。

"You can take a shower if you want," he told her over his shoulder. "Dinner will be awhile."  
"如果你想的话，可以先去洗个澡，" 他回头对她说。"晚饭还要一会儿。"

Asuka didn't move. 明日香没有动。

Being alone with Shinji meant she'd have to think about all the disgusting things she saw again. She still refused to eat anything he touched. She hated having him talk, sending the remnants of his putrid seed into the air around her. When she sat at the table with him all she could smell was him.  
与真嗣独处意味着她不得不再次回想那些令她作呕的画面。她仍然拒绝吃任何他碰过的东西。她讨厌他开口说话，将他那恶臭的残余种子散布在她周围的空气中。当她与他同桌而坐时，她只能闻到他的气味。

There was a problem only she knew about. So it was a problem only she could solve. Dragging the other adults into it would just get messy. She'd prove to Kaji she was grown up. She'd prove to Misato she was capable alone. She could do this by herself. She could do this.  
有一个只有她知道的问题。所以这是一个只有她能解决的问题。把其他成年人牵扯进来只会让事情变得复杂。她要向加持证明她已经成熟。她要向美里证明她能独自应对。她可以自己解决这个问题。她可以做到。

"So how's your darling Kirishima?" she opened. "Not serving her every whim tonight?"  
"那么，你的宝贝桐生怎么样了？"她开口问道。"今晚没有伺候她的每一个奇思妙想吗？"

"I saw her earlier. She had plans with her father."  
"我之前见过她。她和她的父亲有约。"

His voice didn't hitch or hesitate on the word father. Asuka noticed he was less prone to visible misery the past week or so. He wasn't dancing and singing in the sunshine, but he wasn't ruining everyone else's day with his sour attitude.  
他说'父亲'这个词时，声音没有颤抖或犹豫。明日香注意到，过去一周左右，他明显不那么容易显露出痛苦了。虽然他还没有在阳光下欢歌起舞，但也不再因为他的坏脾气而毁掉其他人的日子。

_Is he that desperate for perceived affection?_ she wondered. _Some weirdo bothers to spend time with him and he surrenders completely._  
他真的那么渴望被关注吗？她疑惑着。某个怪人花时间陪他，他就完全沦陷了。

"A daddy's girl, huh?" “爸爸的小公主，是吧？”

"I guess." He slid his hands from the soapy water and dried them on his apron. "He's real busy, so they don't see each other often."  
“我想是的。”他把手从肥皂水中抽出，用围裙擦干。“他真的很忙，所以他们不常见面。”

"She introduce you to him yet?"  
"她还没把你介绍给他吗？"

Shinji paused. "Um, he doesn't know about… about me and her. She said he might not approve of her dating."  
真嗣顿了顿。“呃，他还不知道……我和她的事。她说他可能不会同意她谈恋爱。”

_So he's a little pet she keeps secret from daddy. Pathetic.  
所以他只是她瞒着爸爸偷偷养的小宠物。真可悲。_

"Do you feel like anything special for dinner?" Shinji asked, smiling. "I could make something new, or we could even get something from that new takeout place by—"  
"晚餐有什么特别想吃的吗？" 真嗣微笑着问，"我可以做些新花样，或者我们可以从那家新开的快餐店买点什么——"

"Stop acting so familiar with me," she told him. "I'm not your little girlfriend."  
"别表现得跟我那么熟络，" 她对他说，"我又不是你的小女朋友。"

He drew back. "I know." His voice was a relieved appeal to God. He turned away and began drying the clean dishes by the sink.  
他退缩了。"我知道。"他的声音带着一种如释重负的祈求。他转过身去，开始在洗碗池边擦干已经洗净的碗碟。

Asuka forcibly discarded the punch begging to jump from her fist. _Time for some tough love._ She shook her head. _Tough tolerance. Tough pity._  
明日香强行压制住从拳头中跃跃欲试的拳击。是时候展现一些严厉的爱了。她摇了摇头。坚强的忍耐。坚强的怜悯。

She pushed herself into the kitchen, crossing her arms as she came up behind him.  
她推开自己走进厨房，交叉双臂，从他身后走近。

"You overslept this morning," she said. "Were you late to meet Kirishima? Did she punish you?"  
“你今早睡过头了，”她说道，“去见桐生会迟到吗？她惩罚你了吗？”

His stance shifted at her tone and he put down the cloth. "What do you mean?"  
"她的语气让他改变了站姿，他放下了手中的布。“你什么意思？””

"Did she refuse to eat lunch with you? Or not hold hands? Or make you lick your semen off the floor again?"  
"“她拒绝和你共进午餐？还是不牵手？或者又让你舔地板上的精液？””

His stance shifted again. She watched him grip the counter. "That's disgusting."  
"他的站姿再次改变。她看着他紧抓着柜台。“太恶心了。””

"Yeah, it is." "是啊，确实。"

"I don't know what you're talking about," Shinji said. His voice was low. "I'm surprised you think about stuff like that."  
"我不知道你在说什么，" 真嗣说。他的声音很低。"我很惊讶你会想这些事。"

Asuka bit down on a flash of rage. She was not going to let him turn this around on her.  
明日香咬紧了愤怒的火花。她不会让他把这事儿反过来怪到她头上。

"I'm surprised you _do_ stuff like that," she said. "I _saw_ you two in the supply shed yesterday. I'm sure you remember. Or do you need a reminder? Should I take my socks off? I bet my feet taste better than Kirishima's."  
"我真没想到你会做那种事，"她说道，"昨天我在仓库看到你们俩了。你肯定记得吧。还是需要我提醒一下？我该脱掉袜子吗？我敢打赌我的脚味比切岛的好。"

A tremor ran through his hands clutching the counter. His shoulders drooped. He took a deep breath through his nose. When he turned around to her his face was devoid of expression.  
他紧握着柜台的双手微微颤抖，肩膀下垂。他深吸一口气，从鼻子里呼出。当他转过身面对她时，脸上毫无表情。

"Okay. Fine. You made fun of me. Good one. Can we drop it now?"  
"好吧，行了。你取笑了我，干得漂亮。我们现在能不提这事了吗？"

She gaped at him in bafflement. "No. No, we can't. I'd _love_ to drop it and forget I ever saw that marathon of debauchery but I don't have that luxury. You're a pilot. As troubling as it is, I have to rely on you in battle sometimes. And I refuse to place my life in the hands of someone who abandons all self-worth at the beck and call of some girl with a foot fetish." Asuka scowled at his silence. "So, what? You're not even going to defend yourself?"  
她困惑地瞪着他。“不，不行。我倒是希望能放下这一切，忘记那场荒唐的狂欢，但我没那个福气。你是飞行员。尽管这让人不安，我有时还得靠你在战场上。而我绝不会把自己的性命交给一个随随便便就被某个有恋足癖的女孩牵着鼻子走、连自我价值都抛弃的人。”明日香皱眉看着他的沉默。“所以呢？你连为自己辩解都不打算吗？”

"Like you'd understand." “像你这种人怎么会懂。”

"What's that supposed to mean?"  
“你这话是什么意思？”

"You've never even been in a relationship," he muttered. "How do you know what couples should and shouldn't do?"  
"你连一次恋爱都没谈过，"他咕哝道。"你怎么知道情侣之间该做什么不该做什么？"

"Because I have morals?" she snapped at him, ignoring the insult. "Because I have self-esteem? Because I'm normal? Take your pick. I _know_ because I'm not wearing blinders around someone throwing me scraps of attention like you are. And like you know so much. This sick little _thing_ you're involved in is your first. You can really stand there and tell me this is all okay? That you think that girl is normal?" She waited, breathing hard, glaring at him to respond. "Answer me!"  
"因为我有道德底线？"她厉声回敬，无视他的侮辱。"因为我有自尊？因为我正常？随便你选。我知道是因为我没有像你那样对那些施舍般关注我的人视而不见。而你又懂得多少。你参与的这个病态的小游戏是你的第一次。你真的能站在那里告诉我这一切都没问题？你认为那个女孩正常吗？"她等待着，呼吸急促，怒视着他，等待他的回应。"回答我！"

"Just leave me alone," he mumbled, escaping around the table and heading for the hall to his room.  
"别管我了，"他嘟囔着，绕过桌子朝通往他房间的走廊走去。"

"How can you be okay with this?" she demanded, cutting him off. She reached out and grabbed his shoulder. "You are not going to run away from me."  
“你怎么能接受这个？”她质问道，打断了他。她伸出手抓住他的肩膀。“你别想从我这里逃走。”

Shinji spun out of her hold and gripped her arms. Asuka was so surprised she froze. Their eyes met and she saw the same surprise before it was swallowed by fury. He drove her into the wall and she hit the back of her head. Stars cartwheeled at the edges of her vision.  
真嗣挣脱她的掌握，紧紧抓住她的手臂。明日香惊讶得僵住了。他们的目光相遇，她看到了同样的惊讶，随即被愤怒吞没。他将她推向墙壁，她的后脑勺撞在墙上，视野边缘闪烁着星星。

"Don't ruin this for me," he told her. "Stay out of it. This is mine, understand?" He backed away, clenching and unclenching his hands, trying to erase the blistering sensation of her skin.  
“别毁了这一切，”他告诉她。“别插手。这是我的，明白吗？”他后退几步，紧握又松开双手，试图抹去她肌肤上灼热的触感。

She held her head and fell backwards against the wall. She probed the injury but her fingers came away dry. He watched her in panicked dread.  
她抱着头，向后倒靠在墙上。她探查着伤口，但手指上却没有血迹。他惊恐地看着她。

Asuka reached out blindly to slap him. He jerked aside and she staggered past him, stumbling across the kitchen to the edge of the hall. She dug her nails into the wall and refused her body the indulgence of collapsing. She heard him move behind her.  
明日香盲目地伸手去打他。他猛地闪开，她踉跄着从他身边走过，跌跌撞撞地穿过厨房，来到走廊的边缘。她用指甲抠进墙里，拒绝让自己的身体倒下。她听到他在她身后移动。

"Get away from me," she hissed. "Get away or I _will_ make you sorry."  
“离我远点，”她低声咆哮，“走开，否则我会让你后悔的。”

He stopped. 他停了下来。

Her vision was a tunnel of prickly seizuring static. She hugged the wall, feeling her way to her bedroom door.  
她的视野变成了一片刺痛的、抽搐般的静电隧道。她紧贴着墙壁，摸索着走向卧室的门。

"Just… Just leave this alone," Shinji's voice floated after her as she skimmed the hallway. The words were choked. "It's none of your business."  
“就…就别管这事了，”她沿着走廊匆匆而过时，真嗣的声音飘了过来。那话语哽咽着，“这不关你的事。”

Asuka slipped inside her room as the dots began dispersing from before her eyes. The incensed strength of determination faded and she slid to the floor. Her head became stone-heavy and drooped. She watched her door through her bangs. She did not hear Shinji. The apartment wallowed in silence.  
明日香悄悄溜进自己的房间，眼前的光点开始散去。愤怒带来的坚定力量逐渐消退，她滑坐在地板上。她的头变得沉重如石，低垂下来。她透过刘海注视着房门。她没有听到真嗣的声音。公寓沉浸在寂静之中。

/\/\/\/\

The hiss of a bedroom door shutting woke her up.  
卧室门关闭的嘶嘶声将她唤醒。

Monday was a holiday, an obscure Japanese observance Asuka didn't care about. But it was a day free of school and kanji, and a day she could spend trying to figure out why she hadn't forcibly removed Shinji Ikari's head from his scrawny torso.  
周一是个节日，一个明日香并不在意的日本冷门节日。但这天没有学校和汉字作业，她可以利用这一天来弄清楚为什么没有强行把真嗣·碇的脑袋从他那瘦弱的身躯上扯下来。

Talking back to her was one thing. Daring to assault her was another. But getting him that angry proved she knew exactly what was going on, despite his protests. Normal girlfriends didn't make their boyfriends lick their semen off the dirty gym shed floor. Shinji could rationalize it to himself however he wished but he had become a liability in and out of battle, and forced Asuka's hand.  
顶撞她是一回事，胆敢攻击她则是另一回事。但他如此愤怒，证明她确实知道发生了什么，尽管他极力否认。普通的女朋友不会让男友舔干净肮脏体育仓库地板上的精液。真嗣可以自圆其说，但无论在战场上还是生活中，他已成为一个负担，迫使明日香不得不采取行动。

She didn't want to deal with it. She had enough burdens in her life without being forced to sort out all of Shinji's problems too, but he certainly wasn't solving anything himself. He was a failure at life, relying on everyone else to clean up after him while actively hindering aid.  
她不想面对这一切。她的生活已经够沉重了，还要被迫解决真嗣的所有问题，而他显然自己解决不了任何事。他是个生活中的失败者，依赖别人为他收拾残局，同时又阻碍着别人的帮助。

_I didn't fail,_ she told herself. _I just got a little sidetracked by his crazy._ It was humiliating that she was caught off guard. _By Shinji, of all people._  
我没有失败，她对自己说。只是被他的疯狂稍稍分了心。被真嗣这样的人打了个措手不及，真是丢脸。

Asuka stared at the door. She heard him in the hall, walking from his room. He stopped in front of her bedroom and she held her breath.  
明日香盯着门。她听到他在走廊里，从他的房间走出来。他在她卧室前停下，她屏住了呼吸。

_Keep moving,_ she snarled in her mind. _Don't you dare try to talk to me right now._  
继续走，她在心里咆哮。现在你敢试着跟我说话试试。

He moved away into the kitchen and was lost amid the clatter of dishware. A few moments later his voice called out announcing his departure. The front door slid open and then closed. Asuka rose from the floor and drifted out of her room.  
他走进厨房，消失在餐具的嘈杂声中。片刻后，他的声音传来，宣告着他的离开。前门滑开又关上。明日香从地板上起身，飘出她的房间。

Misato was conducting a heinous chemistry experiment on the kitchen stove. She turned and offered friendly derision.  
美里正在厨房炉子上进行一项可怕的化学实验。她转过身来，友好地嘲讽道。

"Hello, sunshine. Sleep long enough? It's past eleven."  
“你好啊，阳光小姐。睡得够久了吗？已经十一点多了。”

"Why are you cooking?" Asuka asked her guardian. She stayed at the entrance of the kitchen held by the dread and stench emanating from within.  
“你为什么在做饭？”明日香问她的监护人。她站在厨房入口处，被里面的恐惧和恶臭所困。

"Shinji's out with his little girlfriend for lunch. So, it falls on me and my refined culinary skills to provide you with sustenance."  
“真嗣和他的小女朋友出去吃午饭了。所以，就靠我和我精湛的厨艺来给你提供补给了。”

Her guardian was, despite personal habits and decisions off the clock, a tactician. Her greatest ability seemed to be dumb luck but she had the resources and clout to force an end to her problem. And Shinji was definitely a problem. He denied her, he humiliated her, he hurt her. Now anything was justified to return the favor, even taking advantage of outside assistance. It wasn't failure if she still set things in motion.  
尽管她的监护人在非工作时间有着个人的习惯和决定，但她仍是一位策略家。她最大的能力似乎是靠运气，但她拥有足够的资源和影响力来迫使问题结束。而真嗣绝对是个问题。他拒绝她，羞辱她，伤害她。现在任何事情都是为了回报他而正当的，甚至利用外部帮助。只要她仍在推动事情发展，就不算失败。

_Right? 对吧？_

"Hello," Misato called out when Asuka stood staring into space. "You okay?"  
"你好，" 美里在明日香呆呆地望着空中时喊道。"你还好吗？"

"Just stunned by seeing you cooking. And by your naiveté. You're really allowing that 'relationship' to continue?"  
"只是被你做饭的样子惊到了。还有你的天真。你真的允许那种'关系'继续下去吗？"

"It's cute," she said, grinning at her. "Don't tell me you're jealous."  
"挺可爱的，" 她笑着对她说。"别告诉我你在嫉妒。"

_Do all adults think like this?_ Asuka thought, recalling her conversation with Kaji with a new bitterness. "Don't you know what they're doing?"  
所有成年人都是这么想的吗？明日香想着，回忆起与加持的那次对话，心中涌起一股新的苦涩。“你不知道他们在做什么吗？”

"Eating, right?" She suddenly leered and turned away. "Bad Misato. Stop that right now. They're kids."  
“吃饭吧？”她突然露出不怀好意的笑容，转过身去。“坏美里。快停下来。他们还是孩子。”

_One of them is eating._ "This Kirishima girl is a control freak. She's been ordering him to do all sorts of things."  
其中一个确实在吃饭。“这个雾岛女孩是个控制狂。她一直在命令他做各种事情。”

"Eh?" Misato stared blankly at her. "Sure, she bosses him around a bit… okay, a lot, but…" She shrugged and quirked a smile. "She's a teenage girl and he's a teenage boy."  
"嗯？" 美里茫然地看着她。"当然，她是对他有点指手画脚……好吧，是很多，但是……" 她耸了耸肩，露出一丝微笑。"她是个少女，而他是个少年。"

"Exactly." "正是如此。"

"What is it you're not telling me?"  
"你还有什么没告诉我的？"

"You really don't know." Asuka shook her head. "I thought we had ghosts trailing us everywhere."  
"你真的不知道。" 明日香摇了摇头。"我还以为我们走到哪儿都有鬼跟着呢。"

"You do." Misato's voice had dropped all pretense of amusement.  
"你确实。" 美里的话音已不再掩饰其中的戏谑。

"Well, they're doing a crappy job. Or they're not reporting anything important."  
"好吧，他们的工作做得真糟糕。要么就是他们没报告任何重要的事情。"

"Section-2 has noninterference orders for you three," she said after a moment of debate. "If there's a hint of danger they'll swarm the area." She watched her ward tap her foot and look anywhere but at her. "Damn it, Asuka. Just tell me what's wrong."  
"第二分部对你们三人有非干涉命令，" 她在一番争论后说道，"一旦有危险的迹象，他们会立即包围该区域。" 她看着她的监护对象轻敲着脚，目光四处游移，唯独不看她。"该死，明日香。直接告诉我哪里不对劲。"

Once she told it would cement the acts. It would reshape the world based on those acts. It would no longer be a secret between Shinji and Mana. Everyone would know, and everyone would react. They would direct and control and force and resolve and steal her revenge and do everything Asuka could not do on her own. She had been reactive. She had been proactive. Neither worked. She failed and everyone would know it.  
一旦她说了，这些行为将变得不可逆转。它们将重塑世界，基于这些行为。这秘密将不再只属于真嗣和玛娜之间。每个人都会知道，每个人都会做出反应。他们会指导、控制、强迫、解决，甚至夺走她的复仇，做一切明日香无法独自完成的事情。她曾经被动应对，也曾经主动出击。但两种方式都失败了。她失败了，所有人都会知道这一点。

She failed. 她失败了。

"I followed them to the supply shed on Saturday after school." And she continued.  
“周六放学后，我跟着他们到了储物间。”她继续说道。

Misato listened with pale neutrality, staring at Asuka the whole time. When it was over she sat down and leaned heavily on the table, rubbing her eyes in her palms. She took a deep breath.  
美里以苍白的平静倾听着，全程凝视着明日香。当一切结束时，她坐了下来，重重地靠在桌子上，用手掌揉着眼睛。她深吸了一口气。

"Why didn't you tell me this immediately?" she asked.  
“你为什么不马上告诉我这些？”她问道。

"It was only a couple days," Asuka said, looking away. _Failure. Loser._  
“只是几天的事，”明日香说着，目光移开。失败者。

"That's a shitty excuse," Misato said.  
“那是个烂借口，”美里说。

She gaped at her, surprisingly offended. "I _tried_ talking to him. He freaked out. Like, really freaked out. It wasn't like I was ignoring this! This isn't _my_ fault. You idiots at NERV dropped the ball!"  
她惊讶地瞪着她，感到意外地被冒犯。“我试着和他谈过。他吓坏了。真的吓坏了。我不是在忽视这个问题！这不是我的错。你们 NERV 的蠢货搞砸了！”

Misato stared her down. She took another breath. She rose and picked up the phone. The rapid electric tones filled the apartment. When she talked her voice was a strained good humor.  
美里盯着她。她又深吸了一口气。她站起来拿起电话。急促的电子音充满了公寓。当她说话时，她的声音带着一种勉强的幽默感。

"Shinji? It's me. There's been an emergency call at headquarters. No, no, it isn't an Angel. Just get down there right away, okay? I'll meet you there. Hmm? No, I haven't talked to Asuka lately. Hurry up now, okay? See you soon."  
"真嗣？是我。总部有紧急呼叫。不，不，不是使徒。你赶紧过来，好吗？我们那里见。嗯？没有，我最近没和明日香联系。快点，好吗？待会儿见。"

Misato hung up and dialed again. Her voice was calm death.  
美里挂断电话，再次拨号。她的声音平静如死。

"It's me. As soon as the Third Children is away apprehend Mana Kirishima and relocate her to HQ. Use route 27 to the detention block." She paused. "Subject is not to be harmed."  
"是我。第三适格者一离开，立刻逮捕 Mana Kirishima 并将其转移至总部。使用 27 号路线前往拘留区。""她顿了顿。""不得伤害目标。"

Misato hung up. She ran a hand through sweaty hair. She spun on Asuka.  
美里挂断了电话。她用手拨弄着湿漉漉的头发。她转身面对明日香。

"We're going to headquarters now." She disappeared into her room to change.  
“我们现在去总部。”她消失在房间里换衣服。

"Why do I have to tag along?" Asuka demanded.  
“为什么我非得跟着去？”明日香质问道。

"I need your firsthand account. I can't just go accusing her of this."  
"我需要你亲口告诉我。我不能就这样去指责她。"

"I'm sure you can convince them to talk by yourself."  
"我相信你能自己说服他们开口。"

"So am I." "我也这么认为。"

Something in her tone filled Asuka with genuine fear. She swallowed the rest of her argument and went to her room to change.  
她语气中的某些东西让明日香感到真切的恐惧。她咽下了剩下的争辩，回到房间去换衣服。

She shut her door and got out her school uniform. She felt some degree of formality was needed when accusing a fellow classmate of sexually abusing one of the only three people capable of saving the world.  
她关上门，拿出校服。在指控同班同学性侵仅有的三位能拯救世界的人之一时，她觉得需要一定的正式感。

She finished tying her bow, staring at her reflection in the mirror mounted on her closet door. The face that gazed back was a dispassionate collection of features. She didn't recognize it.  
她系好领结，凝视着衣柜门上镜子中的自己。那张回望的脸庞是一副冷漠的五官集合。她认不出那是谁。

"Failure," she told the person in the mirror.  
"失败," 她对镜中的人说道。

/\/\/\/\

Two days later Shinji was allowed to return home. Ostensibly the extended stay at NERV was for a lengthy debriefing session and medical workup. Unofficially, Asuka knew, it was for him to calm down. She admitted he took it better than she expected; he didn't cry or attack anyone. He just said how everything was ruined and they didn't understand anything.  
两天后，真嗣被允许回家。表面上，在 NERV 的延长停留是为了进行长时间的汇报会议和医疗检查。但私下里，明日香知道，这是为了让真嗣冷静下来。她承认他处理得比她预想的要好；他没有哭泣或攻击任何人。他只是说一切都毁了，他们什么都不懂。

Asuka was sent on a suggested holiday at Hikari's, giving her roommates a grace period to privately readjust. Another three days and Misato ended her gentle exile, allowing her home to find a dirty front hall, a kitchen filled with used dishes and half-eaten instant food cartons. Beer cans dotted the entire apartment. Everything smelled stale and old.  
明日香被建议去光那里度假，给她的室友们一个私下调整的缓冲期。又过了三天，美里结束了她温和的流放，让她回家，发现前厅脏乱不堪，厨房里堆满了用过的餐具和半吃的速食盒。啤酒罐遍布整个公寓。一切都散发着陈旧和腐朽的气息。

Misato emerged from her room in uniform. Her responsibilities at NERV could be postponed for only so long, even in the face of such a scandal.  
美里穿着制服从房间里走出来。她在 NERV 的职责只能推迟这么久，即便是在面对如此丑闻的情况下。

"Welcome home," she said, sounding rushed. "Sorry about the mess." She weaved through the chaos to the front hall and her shoes.  
“欢迎回家，”她急匆匆地说道，“抱歉这里这么乱。”她穿过一片狼藉，走向前厅和她的鞋子。

"Someone's been slacking off around here," Asuka said, resting against the refrigerator and running a critical eye over the room.  
“这里有人偷懒了啊，”明日香靠在冰箱上，用挑剔的目光扫视着房间。

"We've had other things to worry about." She peeked her head back into the kitchen. She hesitated. "He's in his room sleeping."  
"我们还有其他事情要担心。" 她把头探回厨房。她犹豫了一下。"他在房间里睡觉。"

"That's one way to avoid reality a little longer."  
"那是一种逃避现实更久一点的方式。"

Misato pursed her lips. "He's… he's been through a lot, okay? Try to go easy on him." She preempted her ward's outrage. "As a favor to me. I'll owe you."  
美里抿了抿嘴唇。"他……他经历了很多，好吗？试着对他宽容些。" 她预先阻止了她的监护人的愤怒。"就当是帮我个忙。我会欠你一个人情。"

Asuka snorted softly. "If anything, he should be thanking me until he's hoarse. I'm the one who brought all this to light. Is he still whining about how we ruined his life?"  
明日香轻声哼了一下。“如果有什么，他应该感谢我到嗓子哑了。是我揭露了这一切。他还在抱怨我们毁了他的生活吗？”

"He's been through a lot," she repeated slowly. She chewed her lip. "You weren't present for the entire interrogation."  
“他经历了很多，”她慢慢地重复道。她咬着嘴唇。“你并没有全程参与审讯。”

"And? Feet weren't the extent of Kirishima's hobbies? So what if I didn't hear every sordid detail? I saw enough. Are you hiding something?"  
“然后呢？基里沙马的爱好不仅仅是脚？就算我没听到每一个肮脏的细节又怎样？我看到的已经够多了。你在隐瞒什么吗？”

"Like you said, you didn't hear every sordid detail. Leave it at that." Misato stopped moving and fixed her with her Captain's stare. _"Leave him be,"_ she ordered her before she left.  
"就像你说的，你没有听到每一个肮脏的细节。就到此为止吧。" 美里停下动作，用她队长的目光盯着她。"别管他了，"她命令她之后离开了。

Asuka crossed her arms and leaned against the frame of Shinji's open door. It was dark in his room, only the thin knife of light from the hall cutting over his bed to reveal him laying down, his back to her. He did not move.  
明日香交叉双臂，靠在真嗣敞开的门框上。他的房间很暗，只有从走廊射入的一道细光划过他的床，显露出他躺在那里，背对着她。他没有动。

"How long are you going to stay in here moping in the dark?"  
"你还要在这里在黑暗中消沉多久？"

He was silent. 他沉默不语。

"This is stupid. You're being stupid. Yeah, you lost your sicko girlfriend and everyone knows what a puppet you are, but at least now there's a semi-legitimate reason for everyone to give you special treatment for a while. Soak it up."  
“这太蠢了。你表现得真蠢。是啊，你失去了那个变态女友，大家都知道你是个傀儡，但现在至少有个半合法的理由让大家暂时对你特殊关照。好好享受吧。”

Asuka sighed at his lack of reaction.  
明日香对他的无动于衷叹了口气。

"Kirishima's dad was transferred to God-knows-where. Everyone's keeping this real hush-hush. Why NERV isn't pressing charges is beyond me. Or doing something about that little sociopath Kirishima."  
"桐島的爸爸被调到了不知名的地方。大家都对此保持沉默。我不明白 NERV 为什么不追究责任，或者对那个小社会病态的桐島采取措施。"

She watched his side rise and fall as he breathed.  
她看着他的侧身随着呼吸起伏。

"Well, maybe you _should_ be pouting. What do I know? Maybe you enjoyed all the debasement. I mean, I only call you names. How can I compete with someone who makes you lick her feet?"  
"好吧，也许你应该在生气。我怎么知道？也许你享受所有的羞辱。我是说，我只是叫你名字。我怎么能和让你舔她脚的人竞争呢？"

He exhaled hard from his nose.  
他用力从鼻子里呼出一口气。

"You ruined everything," Shinji finally spoke. His voice was low and tight.  
"你毁了一切，" 真嗣终于开口了。他的声音低沉而紧绷。

"Yeah, I remember you telling me that before. Try something new. And rational."  
"是啊，我记得你之前跟我说过。试试新的方法。理智点。"

Shinji was silent. 真嗣沉默了。

"Look. Kirishima was messed up, okay? What you did…" She frowned tightly and forced the words out. "What she _made_ you do, was wrong. No one should have to do that. I don't care if she told you she liked you or whatever. It was wrong." She sighed sharply. "I'm sorry you had to go through it, okay? Is that what you've been waiting to hear? I'm _sorry_."  
“听着，桐生那家伙很混乱，好吗？你做的那些事……”她紧紧皱眉，艰难地挤出话来。“她让你做的那些事，是错的。没人应该经历那些。我不管她是否告诉过你喜欢你之类的。那都是错的。”她急促地叹了口气。“我很抱歉你不得不经历这些，好吗？这就是你一直在等的道歉吗？我很抱歉。”

He didn't react. She set her jaw.  
他没有反应。她咬紧了牙关。

"But when you pushed me…" Asuka's eyes narrowed to slits. She spoke through clenched teeth. "I will give you a pass this one time. If you _ever_ touch me like that again you will get no pity from me. Got it?"  
"但当你推我的时候……" 明日香的眼神变得锐利如刀。她咬牙切齿地说道。"这次我放过你。如果你再敢那样碰我，别指望我会同情你。明白了吗？"

Shinji rose on an elbow and looked at her with one eye. "_You_ don't get it. You ruined everything."  
真嗣撑起手肘，用一只眼睛看着她。"你不懂。你毁了一切。"

"You keep saying that. Get over it."  
"你一直这么说。算了吧。"

"You always think you know everything."  
"你总是以为自己什么都懂。"

"Oh my God," Asuka muttered. "What is _wrong_ with you? She was _abusing_ you. She was just using you for a sick little thrill. Some pathetic juvenile power trip with a _wimp_ so desperate for some attention he'd debase himself for her pleasure."  
"哦，我的天，" 明日香喃喃道。"你到底怎么了？她在虐待你。她只是利用你来寻求一种病态的小刺激。一个可怜的青少年权力游戏，和一个如此渴望关注以至于愿意为了她的快乐而自贬身价的懦夫。"

"You think you know everything," he said again.  
"你以为自己什么都懂，" 他又说了一遍。"

"I know more than _you_. I know what's right and what's wrong. I know I _saved_ your ungrateful behind."  
"我比你懂得多。我知道什么是对什么是错。我知道我救了你这个不知感恩的家伙。"

Shinji turned around fully, sitting on the edge of his bed. He stood, straightening slowly. Asuka pushed off from the door and squared her shoulders. He took a step forward and she curled her fists.  
真嗣完全转过身来，坐在床边。他慢慢站直了身子。明日香从门边推开，挺直了肩膀。他向前迈了一步，她则握紧了拳头。

"Keep your distance," she told him in a low, dangerous voice.  
"保持距离，"她用低沉而危险的声音对他说。"

He stopped two paces from her. He met her eyes and did not look away. His face sank in miserable anger.  
他在离她两步远的地方停下。他直视她的眼睛，没有移开目光。他的脸上流露出痛苦的愤怒。

"You didn't save me," he said with a wavering voice. He breathed and regained a degree of control. "You just did what you always do. You do whatever you want and never think about the consequences or what it does to anyone else. You're selfish."  
“你没救我，”他用颤抖的声音说。他深吸一口气，恢复了一些控制力。“你只是做了你一贯做的事。你随心所欲，从不考虑后果或对别人的影响。你很自私。”

Asuka never saw him this angry before and took a perverse satisfaction in it. This was what he needed to tell her what he really felt? Getting revealed as a coward and weakling made him rebel against those personae? He wasn't hiding behind passive-aggressiveness or politeness or dependency. She finally brought out a genuine reaction from him.  
明日香从未见过他如此愤怒，心中竟生出一丝扭曲的满足感。这就是他需要告诉她真实感受的方式吗？被揭露为懦夫和弱者让他反抗这些角色？他不再隐藏在消极攻击性、礼貌或依赖背后。她终于激发出他真实的反应。

"Selfish?" she repeated. "Oh, yeah. Rescuing you from humiliation and abuse was so selfish of me. How dare I think of someone else's predicament and actively work to solve it. No, Shinji, _you're_ the selfish one. You create these kinds of situations to make people feel sorry for you. You finally got caught and now you're desperate to blame anyone else—"  
"自私？"她重复道。"哦，没错。从羞辱和虐待中救你出来，我真是太自私了。我怎么敢考虑别人的困境并积极去解决它。不，真嗣，你才是自私的那个。你制造这些情况让别人为你感到难过。你终于被抓住了，现在却急着把责任推给别人——"

"Shut _up!_" he roared. "You never listen to anyone!" Shinji clutched at the air in front of her. "You don't… You don't know anything! You always take everything from me. Does it offend you so much to see me happy?"  
"闭嘴！"他咆哮道。"你从不听任何人说话！"真嗣在她面前抓着空气。"你不懂……你什么都不懂！你总是从我这里夺走一切。看到我幸福，你就这么难受吗？"

"How could you be happy?" she yelled back at him. "How could you be happy with her doing those things to you?"  
"你怎么可能幸福？"她对他吼回去。"她那样对你，你怎么可能幸福？"

"Do you know _why_ she did those things? I _told_ her to do those things to me. I _wanted_ her to do those things to me. I _told_ her and she _did_ them. Do you have any idea what that's _like?_"  
"你知道她为什么做那些事吗？我让她对我做那些事。我想要她对我做那些事。我告诉她了，她就做了。你知道那是什么感觉吗？"

Asuka stared at him in dawning horror.  
明日香盯着他，眼中逐渐流露出惊恐。

"She didn't want to at first. I convinced her. _I convinced her_. Mana listened to me and did what I wanted and never judged me. It didn't matter what it was, she did it. And then she _praised_ me for it. She praised me. She said she liked me. She was nice to me."  
"起初她并不愿意。我说服了她。我说服了她。真奈听从了我，做了我想要的，从未评判过我。无论是什么，她都做了。然后她还因此表扬我。她表扬我。她说她喜欢我。她对我很好。"

Asuka took a step away from him.  
明日香向后退了一步。

"I finally…" He broke off, panting hard. "I found someone who would do what _I_ wanted for once. She didn't make me pilot like Ms. Misato or father. She didn't make me confused like Ayanami. And she didn't make me into nothing like you do. Mana listened to me. For the first time in my life I had someone who did what _I_ wanted and who praised me for doing it. And you took it away from me."  
"我终于…" 他喘着粗气，话音戛然而止。"我找到了一个能按我意愿行事的人。她不像美里小姐或父亲那样逼我驾驶 EVA，也不像绫波那样让我困惑。她没有像你那样把我变成一无所有。真奈倾听我。在我生命中第一次，我有了一个按我意愿行事并因此赞美我的人。而你夺走了这一切。"

"You're sick," Asuka whispered, backing out of the room.  
"你疯了，" 明日香低声说着，退出了房间。

"You don't know anything," Shinji told her, and shut his door.  
“你什么都不知道，”真嗣对她说，然后关上了门。

She heard him move, then the rustle of sheets as he collapsed back into bed. Then silence.  
她听到他移动的声音，接着是他倒回床上时床单的沙沙声。然后是一片寂静。

She stared at the plaque on his door. Something dark and angry bubbled to the surface. She slapped the plaque off. It fell by her feet, sending a sharp split across its face.  
她盯着他门上的牌子。一股黑暗而愤怒的情绪涌上心头。她一巴掌把牌子拍掉。牌子落在她脚边，表面裂开了一道尖锐的痕迹。

"_You_ don't know anything!" she shouted at him through the door. "You're even more miserable than I thought! You're pitiful! You're ungrateful! You're so… _stupid!_" She shook in fury. "I can't believe I ever felt sorry for you! You manipulate everyone around you into giving you sympathy! You use people to make yourself feel better! So go ahead and keep trying to fulfill your pathetic need for acceptance because you will _never get it!_"  
"你什么都不知道！" 她隔着门对他大喊。"你比我想象的还要悲惨！你可怜！你不懂得感恩！你真是……愚蠢！" 她气得发抖。"我真不敢相信我曾经为你感到难过！你操纵身边的每一个人来博取同情！你利用别人让自己感觉好些！所以继续努力满足你那可悲的认同需求吧，因为你永远得不到！"

She kicked the plaque down the hall.  
她一脚把走廊上的牌匾踢飞。

"_I can't stand you!"_ She hit the door with her palm as hard as she could. Something cracked.  
"我受不了你！" 她用尽全力一掌拍在门上。有什么东西裂开了。

Asuka turned and stomped away down the hall. She stopped as her foot hit something. Shinji's plaque had skidded in front of her door. She stared at the fracture running over its face, cutting his name in half.  
明日香转过身，沿着走廊气冲冲地走开。她的脚踢到了什么东西，停了下来。真嗣的铭牌滑到了她房门前。她盯着上面裂开的一条缝，将他的名字一分为二。

Asuka snatched it from the floor and hurled it back into the dark towards his room. She heard it clatter against the wall.  
明日香从地板上抓起它，猛地朝他房间的黑暗中扔去。她听到它撞在墙上的声音。

She heaved her door open and stepped into the dark, slamming it behind her. She climbed onto her bed, kneeled, bent over and screamed into her pillow. Her nails dug into the fabric, contorting and twisting it as she emptied her lungs.  
她用力推开房门，踏入黑暗中，砰地一声关上门。她爬上床，跪着，弯下腰对着枕头尖叫。她的指甲深深嵌入布料，扭曲变形，随着她肺部的呼气而紧绷。

The scream spiraled down to a crackly moan and she pulled back panting. The pillow was a warped mass in her fists. She spun and hurled it against the wall separating her room with Shinji's. It struck with a soft breath of violence and slid to the ground.  
尖叫声逐渐减弱成嘶哑的呻吟，她喘息着后退。枕头在她紧握的拳头中扭曲变形。她转身将它猛地掷向分隔她与真嗣房间的墙壁。枕头带着一丝暴力的气息轻轻撞击墙面，然后滑落到地上。

Asuka collapsed to her side and curled into a ball, hugging her knees. She lay in bed in the dark in the silent apartment. She shut her eyes.  
明日香侧身倒下，蜷缩成一团，抱着膝盖。她在黑暗中静静地躺在床上，公寓里一片寂静。她闭上了眼睛。

"You don't know anything."  
“你什么都不懂。”

End 结束

Author notes: Happy Valentine's Day! Yes, this is a reworking of that infamous train wreck, Witness. Mediaminer ate my account or something. So I decided to make all of you suffer again, you lucky people, you.  
作者的话：情人节快乐！没错，这是那部臭名昭著的灾难片《目击者》的重制版。Mediaminer 吞了我的账号还是怎么的。所以我决定让你们这些幸运儿再次受苦，你们真是幸运啊。

The original was horrible. I hope I cleaned it up a bit and made the characterizations not suck as much. It's still messy and bad, but less so? Progress.  
原作糟糕透顶。我希望我稍微清理了一下，让角色塑造不那么糟糕。它仍然混乱且糟糕，但没那么严重了？进步了。

And for the record, I don't think Mana is "average." She's a cutie-pie.  
顺便说一句，我并不认为 Mana 是“普通”的。她是个可爱的小甜心。

### Comment
[FraktalAMT](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1702093/FraktalAMT): 
Oh, GOD... I remember reading this back on Darkscribes before it went down.  
哦，天哪……我记得在它被删除之前在 Darkscribes 上读过这篇文章。  
  
One of only three darkfics in existence I actually had nightmares about. Those who love this kind of stuff will flock to it but me? No way in hell I'll read this once again, it's WAY too depressing!  
这是我做过噩梦的仅有的三部黑暗小说之一。喜欢这种东西的人都会蜂拥而至，但我呢？我绝对不会再读一遍，这太令人沮丧了！

qwertyui:
I love evangelion darkfics and the original Witness is probobally my favourite out of them all. The original was riddled with nice memorable Misato scenes (I think you write her best out of all the characters). Anyway I think the original was superiour to this, mainly because of the length and lessened shock/angst value. Thanks for the new stories.  
我喜欢《新世纪福音战士》黑暗小说，而原作《证人》可能是其中我最喜欢的。原著中充满了令人难忘的美里场景（我认为你在所有角色中写出了她最好的部分）。无论如何，我认为原版优于此，主要是因为长度和减少的震惊/焦虑值。感谢您的新故事。  
  
You know you should write a darkfic were Shinji is dissolved in eva earlier than usual, and comes back like Dr Manhattan from Watchmen (except he isn't bald or muscley and none of the other Watchmen make an appearence). Now he's SHINJI the scrawny, blue, apathetic, indestructable, godlike boy. Who often stares through you, and is gradually losing his ability to connect and give a damn about the human race. If you havn't seen Watchmen you should hire it (after rereading some of the distubing monologues in Filiation) you'd probally like.  
你知道你应该写一部黑暗小说，如果真嗣比平常更早地溶解在伊娃中，然后像《守望者》中的曼哈顿博士一样回来（除了他不秃头或肌肉发达，而且其他守望者都没有出现）。现在他是真嗣，一个骨瘦如柴、忧郁、冷漠、坚不可摧、神一般的男孩。他经常盯着你看，并逐渐失去与人类联系和关心的能力。如果你还没有看过《守望者》，你应该雇佣它（在重读了《亲子关系》中一些令人不安的独白之后）​​你可能会喜欢。  
  
Look foward to all the other fics you got planned. Your comedy stories are among the few fics i've actually laughed out loud to (even the one where Asuka's murdering everybody).  
期待您计划的所有其他小说。你的喜剧故事是我真正笑过的少数小说之一（甚至是明日香谋杀所有人的小说）。

[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C):
This story strikes me as witness without the melodrama.  
这个故事给我留下了深刻的印象，它是没有情节的见证。  
  
In some ways that's better, but it loses the old story's sense of scope. I think I like the first version better, if only because there was a lot more substance to it. The first version more thoroughly explored Asuka's response to Shinji's lack of self-worth.  
在某些方面，这更好，但它失去了旧故事的范围感。我想我更喜欢第一个版本，只是因为它有更多的实质内容。第一个版本更彻底地探讨了明日香对真嗣缺乏自我价值的反应。  
  
However, this one probably is better in character than the last version. And I did enjoy the scene where Asuka confronted Shinji. His desire to just brush things under the rug was well played out, and his anger at Asuka was handled well too.  
然而，这个版本在性格上可能比上一个版本更好。我确实很喜欢明日香与真嗣对峙的场景。他把事情隐藏起来的愿望得到了很好的体现，他对明日香的愤怒也得到了很好的处理。  
  
In overall, this story was probably better written than the original but not as emotionally compelling (in my opinion). But it was a good twist that Mana wasn't the instigator of this. It didn't really fit her character until you explained her reasoning at the end.  
总的来说，这个故事可能比原著写得更好，但在情感上没有那么引人注目（在我看来）。但这是一个很好的转折，玛娜并不是这件事的煽动者。这不太符合她的性格，直到你最后解释了她的理由。

Jason:
Alright, I read this story.  
好吧，我读了这个故事。  
  
Good lord, you do a pretty good job at exploring Eva characters while at the same time treating them like shit. You did a pretty good job with everyone here. I can imagine Shinji would be the type of person who would like to lick his semen off a dirty floor. joking, of course. He just wants someone to do what he wants and be praised. Even if that means being humiliated but the poor guy get's enough of that from everyone else. Oh yeah, WHAT A TWEEST that he was the one who really wore the pants in that relationship. Poor Mana... Asuka's handled well: You see her jealousy over some extracanonical character stealing her "man" and then her disgust when she discovers the whole "Yeah, you lick my toes you no good dog." and finally her self hatred because she didn't stop this soon enough. All while she's treating Shinji like shit because he's spineless and a wimp and a coward bluhblahbluhblublahbluh.  
天哪，你在探索伊娃角色方面做得非常好，同时又把他们当作狗屎对待。你和这里的每个人都做得很好。我可以想象真嗣会是那种愿意从脏地板上舔掉精液的人。当然是开玩笑。他只是希望有人做他想做的事并得到赞扬。即使这意味着被羞辱，但这个可怜的家伙已经受够了其他人的羞辱。哦，是的，真是不可思议，他才是在那段关系中真正说了算的人。可怜的玛娜……明日香处理得很好：你可以看到她对某个超自然角色偷走了她的“男人”的嫉妒，然后当她发现整个“是的，你舔我的脚趾，你不是好狗”时，她感到厌恶。最后是她的自我憎恨，因为她没有尽快停止这一切。她一直把真嗣当作狗屎对待，因为他没有骨气，是个懦夫，是个胆小鬼。  
  
Using the black magic that is the internet, I read the original Witness after reading this. Original was alright but I feel this sort of story works better as a oneshot. And I feel Shinji's reasons in this version for going along with the sick stuff seem more plausible as opposed to the original which is basically "I honestly believe that fingering my own asshole and getting molested by you will let you help me to communicate with my father better Ms. Ritsuko." Heh.  
读完这篇文章后，我利用互联网这一黑魔法阅读了《见证人》的原著。原作还不错，但我觉得这种故事作为一个镜头更好。我觉得真嗣在这个版本中同意这些恶心的理由似乎比原来的版本更合理，基本上是“我真的相信用手指抚弄我自己的屁眼并被你猥亵会让你帮助我和我的父亲沟通”更好的是律子女士。”呵呵。  
  
As for complaints, there is one big one. Shinji's reasons for wanting to be treated like crap are well more defined than they were in the original but Mana doesn't have a good reason to go along with it. I mean, you just have Shinji say "Oh, she didn't want to be my dominatrix at first but then I convinced her and made her completely open to the idea." I guess she just really wanted him to so happy that she didn't ask herself "wait a minute, what am I doing?" I'm no expert in the psychological states of fictional characters but from what I've read, Mana is one of the more normal people in the Evaverse (despite the fact that she's a child soldier/spy)and probably would not be down with kinky sex acts. But who am I to judge. It's not fun when people are psychologically stable. You could have had her been revealed to be a spy just using Shinji to gain information for more angst but meh.  
至于投诉，有一个很大的问题。真嗣想要被当作垃圾对待的原因比原作中的要明确得多，但玛娜没有充分的理由同意它。我的意思是，你只要让真嗣说“哦，她一开始并不想成为我的施虐狂，但后来我说服了她，让她完全接受了这个想法。”我猜她只是真的想让他快乐，所以她没有问自己“等一下，我在做什么？”我不是虚构人物心理状态的专家，但从我读到的内容来看，玛娜是逃避宇宙中比较正常的人之一（尽管她是一名儿童兵/间谍），并且可能不会被打倒变态的性行为。但我有什么资格去评判呢？人心理稳定的时候就不好玩了。你本可以让她被揭露为间谍，只是利用真嗣来获取更多焦虑的信息，但呃。

[LostCompass](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2082489/LostCompass):
What do we have here... under ten thousand words? Hell yeah. Could shave it down, but whatever.  
我们这里有什么……不到一万字？是啊。可以把它剃掉，但无论如何。  
  
So, Ikari uses his familiarity with masochism as a control mechanism to better define his identity, better withstand his daily abuse, and Mana... runs with it. Okay. Maybe. Well, it's Evangelion. Maybe she's a little weird too.  
因此，碇利用他对受虐狂的熟悉作为一种控制机制，以更好地定义他的身份，更好地承受他日常的虐待，而玛娜……也随之而来。好的。或许。嗯，这是新世纪福音战士。也许她也有点奇怪。  
  
Honestly? Yeah, I have to climb aboard the "a little overdramatic" bandwagon. Seems like it'd be more sensible if they shared the sadist/masochist roles, shifting from one to the other. Asuka sees this as Mana's defiling of Shinji, when in reality it's him learning his personal boundaries with Mana's... personal brand of help. And Asuka secretly doesn't want him to learn those boundaries, and to always be codependent on her. Or even having Mana's "control" of Shinji be much more subtle, and the resulting disaster more of a result of Asuka's bizarre paranoia.  
诚实地？是的，我必须搭上“有点过于戏剧化”的潮流。如果他们共同扮演施虐狂/受虐狂的角色，从一个角色转变为另一个角色，似乎会更明智。明日香认为这是玛娜对真嗣的玷污，而实际上，这是他在玛娜的……个人品牌帮助下学习自己的个人界限。明日香私下里不希望他了解这些界限，也不希望他永远依赖她。或者甚至让真奈对真嗣的“控制”更加微妙，而由此造成的灾难更多地是明日香离奇的偏执的结果。  
  
Or something. Good thing this wasn't as long as Normal to Reality, otherwise this review would go on for bloody ever.  
或者其他的东西。还好这没有《正常现实》那么长，否则这篇评论就会一直持续下去。

[Octo8](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2618443/Octo8):
Aww man, Asuka. You had to go and ruin it all.  
哇哦，明日香。你必须去毁掉这一切。  
  
I don't think the story is especially dark. Nothing was really "lost" in the end. It's "just" that Shinji's opportunity for something better was lost. And I mean, if Mana was initially reluctant but did it for his sake... yeah. There was a potential for something better.  
我不认为这个故事特别黑暗。最终什么也没有真正“失去”。 “只是”真嗣失去了获得更好的机会。我的意思是，如果马纳最初不愿意，但为了他而这么做……是的。有可能做出更好的事情。  
  
And now it's ruined. Great showing, Asuka, Misato.  
而现在它已经毁了。表现出色，明日香，美里。
