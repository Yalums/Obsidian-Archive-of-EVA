**_Rough Waters 波涛汹涌_**

October 26, 2002 2002 年 10 月 26 日

---

As the red, blood like waters of the shore come in and out, making an almost soothing noise to the young pilots, the male, out of two people who lay stranded on the beach, opens his eyes. The boy looks around, searching for whatever was left of Tokyo-3, or whomever he was left with. He saw Rei hovering above the shore, and as he blinked, she vanished into thin air.  
当岸边那血色般殷红的水波来来去去，发出近乎抚慰人心的声响，两名搁浅在海滩上的人中，那位男性睁开了眼睛。少年环顾四周，寻找着第三新东京市的残存痕迹，或是与他一同被遗留下来的人。他看见绫波悬浮在岸边，眨眼间，她便消失得无影无踪。

As he searched the area within eyesight, a glimpse of red flashed before his eyes. He turned his head quickly so that whatever he was looking at would not vanish like the other pilot had done. He saw her injuries. A bandage was on her eye, and her arm in somewhat of a cast. He heard her get brutally injured over the intercom, but he never thought it would turn out like this. He got up somewhat and was on his knees. He turned to face the girl completely and thought of all the anger and hatred that was filled up inside her, he was overcome with rage and he kneeled on the girl and started choking her. Her eyes opened immediately and she was just lying there. After a moment of this, she held up her arm and slowly caressed his face. He immediately stopped and started crying on top of her. She couldn't help but feel somewhat sorry for the boy, but her pride was still in tact.  
当他环视视线所及之处，一抹红色突然闪现。他迅速转头，生怕眼前所见像之前那位飞行员一样消失不见。他看到了她的伤势，一只眼睛上缠着绷带，手臂似乎打了石膏。他在对讲机里听到她受了重伤，却未曾想竟是这般模样。他起身跪下，完全转向女孩，想到她内心积聚的愤怒与仇恨，怒火中烧，他跪在她身上开始掐她的脖子。她的眼睛立刻睁开，只是静静躺着。片刻后，她举起手臂，缓缓抚摸他的脸颊。他立刻停手，伏在她身上哭泣。她不禁对这男孩心生怜悯，但她的自尊依旧坚不可摧。

"How disgusting." “真令人作呕。”

He got off her slowly and started to walk in an even pace along the shoreline.  
他缓缓从她身上下来，开始沿着海岸线匀速行走。

She started to panic somewhat, thinking that she will be left alone forever.  
她开始有些慌张，担心自己会永远被遗弃。

"Wait..." she said while trying to sit up, but failing and falling and hitting the back of her head.  
“等等……”她试图坐起来，却失败了，跌倒时后脑勺重重地撞了一下。

"Shiest!" she yelled out to no one in particular while trying to rub the back of her head with her broken arm, not feeling it in the cast.  
“该死！”她向着空无一人的四周大声喊道，试图用打着石膏的断臂揉搓后脑勺，却感觉不到疼痛。

"Ow, she started crying, "Why the hell does this have to happen to me..."  
"哎呀，她哭了起来，"为什么这种事偏偏要发生在我身上……"

He turned around to look at her.  
他转过身来看着她。

"Why did you come back..."  
"你为什么还要回来……"

She didn't reply. 她没有回答。

"Why did you come back?" he said in a stronger voice.  
“你为什么回来？”他用更坚定的声音说道。  
"I don't know! I just did... it was pain… then hope... then here... I just didn't want to die, Shinji... I didn't want to leave," she trailed off to a whisper that was inaudible.  
“我不知道！我只是……那是痛苦……然后是希望……然后就到这里了……我只是不想死，真嗣……我不想离开，”她的话音渐渐低至无声。

"What?" "什么？"

"Never mind. That isn't important. We need to find shelter... we need to survive. " He nodded slowly.  
"没关系。那不重要。我们需要找到庇护所...我们需要生存下去。" 他缓缓地点了点头。

"We don't know what's out there anymore, and we don't know..." she trailed off again seeing the Evangelion Units and the giant corpse out in the water.  
"我们已经不知道外面还有什么了，而且我们也不知道..." 她再次停顿，看到了水中的福音战士单位和巨型尸体。

"Oh Unit two..." "哦，二号机..."

Shinji looked over there to where Eva Unit Two was and a wave of sickness fell upon him.  
真嗣朝二号机所在的方向望去，一阵恶心感突然袭来。

"Asuka, we need to get out of here. Do you think you can stand up at all?" he said while looking at her full of concern.  
“明日香，我们得离开这里。你觉得你能站起来吗？”他满怀关切地看着她说道。

"I don't feel like standing whatsoever. I have no feeling in my lower body."  
“我一点也不想站起来。我的下半身完全没有感觉。”

"Can I..." he gestured at her arms to possibly help her up.  
"我可以...”他向她的手臂示意，可能是想扶她起来。

She looked up at him, nodding slowly, "I need to practice walking again anyhow." He nodded in response while trying to help her up.  
她抬头看着他，缓缓点头，“我无论如何都需要重新练习走路。”他点头回应，同时试图帮助她站起来。

She had a little power in her legs, so she forced herself up with barely any help from him at all. She tried to take a step cautiously to see what would happen with that being a success. She took a couple of steps with Shinji close behind, keeping his arms up in case she had fallen.  
她的双腿还有些力气，所以几乎没怎么借助他的帮助就站了起来。她小心翼翼地尝试迈出一步，看看这次能否成功。她走了几步，而真嗣紧跟在后，双臂举起，以防她摔倒。

"It's OK, I think got the hang of this again..." she looked back at him admiring her. "We should go find shelter," she suggested.  
"没事，我想我又掌握要领了……" 她回头望向他，他正欣赏着她。"我们应该去找个避难所，" 她提议道。

"All right." "好的。"

They walked off the beach and to the streets that weren't destroyed. They saw their old school in rubble, their old apartment complex was somewhat fallen, but they could get in there if they needed anything of theirs. They decided it would be best if they would stay at a vacant apartment, never been rented out to anyone, or so it seemed. They walked up to the apartment and opened the door. Since the impact of the angels, no one seemed to lock their doors anymore. They entered the apartment and there was a kitchen, a living room, and a bedroom - with one bed. That started up an argument on the spot.  
他们离开了海滩，走向未被摧毁的街道。他们看到旧学校已成废墟，旧公寓楼虽有些坍塌，但若需要取回些私人物品，尚可进入。他们决定最好还是住进一间空置的公寓，似乎从未有人租住过。他们走向那间公寓，推开门。自从天使降临的冲击后，似乎再无人锁门。他们进入公寓，里面有厨房、客厅和一间卧室——只有一张床。这立刻引发了一场争论。

"I am getting the bed!"  
"我要去拿床了！"

"Who said you could get it?"  
"谁允许你去拿的？"  
"I did!" "我自己决定的！"

"Why should you get it?"  
"为什么该给你？"

"Cause' I said so!" "因为我这么说了！"

"I'm only letting you have it because you're injured!" he stormed out of the room saying while he was about to leave the house,  
"我让你拿去只是因为你受伤了！" 他一边说着，一边气冲冲地走出房间，正要离开家，

"I'm going to find some food! Stay here!"  
"我要去找点吃的！你留在这里！"

"Where else am I supposed to go...?" she whispered to no one as he closed the door.  
""我还能去哪儿呢...？"" 她对着空无一人的房间低语，而他关上了门。

He walked down to one of the local convenient stores and picked up a weeks worth of supplies. Including a little first aid kit to tend to Asuka's wounds. He grabbed a basket and put all of the items he had gathered and placed on the counter. Since it was day out, he could see, even if the lights were out. He rummaged through a fridge in there and got a bunch of water bottles to keep clean with, since all the water pipes were either rusted or severed. Back at their little apartment, Asuka was sitting on the bed, which with their luck, had been covered with a nice warm, clean bedspread and sheets. She lay back on the bed and sighed. 'Why had I come back?' she thought to herself. 'I thought he had to choose someone to take back with him... but, why me? He could have taken Rei… or Misato... but me? I'm a worthless, heartless bitch, whom no one likes—except some perverted boys who have wet dreams about me. This is much different. Shinji has somewhat grown a backbone through this. He sometimes amazes me. Even though I ridicule him… I should show some compassion. I should treat him better... I should tell-." Her thoughts got cut off by the front door of the apartment opening and closing and him coming into the bedroom.  
他走进当地的一家便利店，采购了一周的生活物资，包括一个小型急救包，以处理明日香的伤口。他拿起一个篮子，将收集的物品放在收银台上。因为是白天，即使没有灯光，他也能看清。他在店内的冰箱里翻找，拿了几瓶水以保持清洁，因为所有的水管要么生锈要么断裂。回到他们的小公寓，明日香正坐在床上，幸运的是，床上铺着干净温暖的床单和被罩。她躺下叹了口气，心想：“我为什么要回来？我以为他必须选择一个人带回去……但为什么是我？他本可以选择零……或者美里……但我？我是个无用、冷酷的婊子，没人喜欢——除了那些对我有幻想的变态男孩。这完全不同。经历了这些，真嗣似乎变得更有骨气了。他有时让我惊讶。尽管我嘲笑他……我应该表现出一些同情。我应该对他更好……我应该告诉他……”"她的思绪被公寓前门的开关声打断，他走进了卧室。

"I got some supplies. They should last a week or two. I also got some water to drink and bathe with..." He placed the items on the counter in the kitchen after leaving Asuka in the other room.  
"我买了些补给品，应该能维持一两周。我还买了些饮用水和洗澡用的水……" 他把东西放在厨房的台面上，然后离开了在另一个房间的明日香。

"Thank you." she bowed her head down to him.  
"谢谢你。" 她向他低头致谢。

"What for? I've been horrible to you. You shouldn't even want to look at me," he said remembering what he had done in the hospital when he had exposed her. He walked out of the room and onto the balcony they had. It was getting dark out, so you could see the stars in the sky starting to appear. She got up off the bed, and slowly followed him out.  
"为什么？我对你那么糟糕。你甚至都不应该想看到我，"他回忆起在医院里揭露她的事情时说道。他走出房间，来到他们共有的阳台上。天色渐暗，可以看到天空中星星开始出现。她从床上起来，慢慢地跟了出去。

"What… what did you do?"  
"你…你做了什么？"

"Too horrible to even think about," he said with a disgusted face, he continued, "I am so fucked up."  
"太可怕了，甚至都不愿去想，"他带着厌恶的表情说，接着道，"我真是太糟糕了。"

"What did you do?" she exclaimed while spinning him around to face her.  
"你做了什么？" 她一边说着，一边将他转过来面对自己。

"Nothing!" "什么也没做！"

"It can't be nothing because you wouldn't have brought it up in the first place."  
"不可能什么都没做，否则你一开始就不会提起这件事。"

"But you'd never want to talk, or look at me again."  
"但你永远不会再想和我说话，或者再看我一眼。"

"It's not like you jacked-off or something when I was in there-" she trailed off looking at the seriousness in his face.  
"又不是我在里面的时候你自慰了或者怎样——"她看着他脸上的严肃，话音渐弱。

Her face was full of confusion, and then it hit her. He had actually done it when she was in the hospital. She decided it was best to not make anything worse out of the situation and just walk away, and that's what she did. Not with an angry face on or anything. Just walked out with a solemn look plastered on her face.  
她的脸上满是困惑，然后她突然明白了。他真的在她住院时那么做了。她觉得最好别让情况变得更糟，于是选择了离开，就这样做了。没有带着愤怒的表情，只是脸上带着一种沉重的神情走了出去。

He looked surprised. He was braced for a slap, punch, kick, or even verbal abuse! But she had acted like an adult. Stopped the bickering, and took matters into her own hands.  
他看起来很惊讶。他本以为会挨一巴掌、一拳、一脚，甚至是一顿辱骂！但她表现得像个成年人。停止了争吵，自己处理了事情。

"Shinji Ikari get your ass in here!"  
“碇真嗣，给我滚进来！”

"Yes, ma'am!" he said obediently and walked into the room. "Now, what you did was wrong, we all know that. But I'm feeling a little bit better now, so as your reward for getting us food and shelter. I give you the bed, with me in it, and with whatever happens in it tonight." she winked at him and went into the kitchen, leaving him in awe.  
“是的，女士！”他顺从地说着，走进了房间。“现在，我们都知道你做错了。但我现在感觉好一点了，所以作为你为我们找到食物和住所的奖励。我把床给你，我在上面，今晚无论发生什么都在上面。”她对他眨了眨眼，走进了厨房，留下他一脸震惊。

"Wh-What?" he stammered while following her into the kitchen.  
"什、什么？" 他结巴着跟她走进厨房。

"You should be mad at me! You should hit me or something… to make yourself feel better! Call me an idiot like you always do! Just do something to show me that you hate me!" he looked at her as she ate some chips.  
"你应该生我的气！你应该打我或者做点什么……让自己感觉好点！像往常一样叫我白痴！做点什么来表明你恨我！" 他看着她边吃薯片边说。

"I don't hate you," she said, mouth full.  
"我不恨你，" 她嘴里塞满了食物说道。

"But... what did you mean by that... that last thing you said?"  
"但是...你说的那最后一句是什么意思？"

"I mean, if we ever do... _you know_… I'll allow it."  
"我是说，如果我们真的...你知道的...我会允许的。"

"But, how can you be so calm about this? And even cheery! We are the last two people on earth Asuka! Adam and Eve, the last remaining survivors! This isn't some picnic you know!"  
"但是，你怎么能这么冷静？甚至还很开心！我们可是地球上最后的两个人，明日香！亚当和夏娃，仅存的幸存者！这可不是什么野餐，你知道的！"

"I know that!" she snapped back at him, breaking out of her mood. "I wanted to make the best out of it, but now Mr. Lets dampen the mood is being a poor sport!"  
"我知道了！"她反驳道，打破了之前的情绪。"我本想好好享受，但现在这位煞风景先生却玩不起！"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Just live with it! Damn!"  
"就忍忍吧！该死！"

"Sorry," he apologized with his head down.  
"对不起，"他低头道歉。

"Stop apologizing, it gets annoying after a while. Now, what do you want to eat?" she rummaged through the basket pulling out an assorted variety of snacks.  
"别再道歉了，久了挺烦的。现在，你想吃点什么？" 她翻找着篮子，掏出各式各样的零食。

"I'm not hungry," he stated, walking back over to the balcony.  
"我不饿，" 他说着，又走回阳台。

"Beautiful isn't it?" she had asked after following him there, looking up at the sky. He nodded. But he wasn't thinking about the sky. He was thinking of how much he actually loved her, how much he wanted her to come back. He was so glad that she had come back. He turned around almost instantly and gave her a hug.  
"很美吧？" 她跟过去后问道，抬头望向天空。他点点头。但他心里想的并非天空。他在想自己有多爱她，多希望她回来。她能回来，他真的很高兴。他几乎立刻转过身，给了她一个拥抱。

"Uh, what was that for?"  
"呃，这是为什么？"

"Thank you so much for coming back. You don't know how much I need you." He said it before it could actually register in his mind.  
"非常感谢你能回来。你不知道我有多需要你。" 他脱口而出，甚至还没来得及在脑海中形成这个念头。

She thought for a second, 'He cares? Who knew?' She smiles briefly and returned the hug.  
她想了一下，'他关心我？谁知道呢？' 她微笑着，回抱了他。

"You don't know how much I wanted to come back."  
"你不知道我有多想回来。"

He smiles briefly while looking out over the balcony, and his mood darkened.  
他短暂地微笑着，望向阳台外，心情却变得阴沉。

"You know." she glanced over the balcony. "We should travel around and explore all of Tokyo-3. Like, NERV HQ and things like that."  
"你知道的。"她瞥了一眼阳台。"我们应该四处走走，探索整个第三新东京市。比如，NERV 总部之类的。"

Thinking about what happened with Misato, and all of the Rei clones... it totally freaked him out thinking about that once again. He shuddered at the thought.  
回想起与碇唯以及所有绫波复制体之间发生的事情，他再次感到不寒而栗。一想到这些，他就忍不住打了个寒颤。

Noticing a change in his mood, she decided to figure out what was the matter with this boy who stood across from her, closing his eyes, trying to shield out the horrible memories.  
察觉到他情绪的变化，她决定弄清楚这个站在她对面、闭上眼睛试图屏蔽可怕记忆的男孩到底怎么了。

"What. What's wrong." she looked at him with concern.  
“怎么了？出什么事了？”她关切地看着他。

"I need to ask you a question." He opened his eyes and glanced her way, making her feel uncomfortable with him looking at her like that.  
"我需要问你一个问题。" 他睁开眼睛，朝她瞥了一眼，那种注视让她感到不自在。

She looked directly in his eyes and replied, "What would that question be?"  
她直视他的眼睛回答道："那个问题是什么？"

"What... what was it like in a coma?" he asked, not paying attention to the sudden darkness in the mood.  
"昏迷...昏迷中是什么感觉？" 他问道，没有注意到气氛突然变得沉重。

"It was just a void, a nothing. It was just me talking to another version of myself, conversing about why I wanted to live, what I have to live for. I had to show myself, the other me that I was worth the time and space that I had taken up in the world. I guess I proved that because I am back here with you now."  
"那只是一片虚无，一片空白。那只是我在与另一个自己对话，探讨我为何想要生存，我为了什么而活。我必须向自己证明，向另一个我证明，我值得占据这个世界上的时间和空间。我想我证明了这一点，因为我现在又回到了你身边。"

"I was in the cage when I heard Maya yell over the intercom that you were attacked by the remaining EVA series, even though you demolished them first. What pushed you to take on all of them?"  
"我在笼子里时，听到玛雅通过对讲机大喊，说你被剩余的 EVA 系列攻击了，尽管你一开始就摧毁了它们。是什么促使你挑战所有它们？"

"I finally found out that my mama was with me all along, helping me through and through. I needed that boost to up my synch ratio and I was able to fight." She glanced down at her clasped hands, fidgeting in her lap. She sighed and glanced back up at him.  
"我终于发现，我的妈妈一直与我同在，无时无刻不在帮助我。我需要那种助力来提高我的同步率，这样我才能战斗。" 她低头看着自己紧握的双手，在膝上不安地动着。她叹了口气，又抬头看向他。

"It was so painful, knowing that I may never see your sweet," she blushed, "face again. And… the Lance of Longinus in my eye." She caressed the eye patch on her head. "It still hurts. I can feel the spear still in my head, Shinji." She coughed slightly, feeling her forehead, feeling that it was somewhat hot; she closed her eyes and sighed, trying to relieve herself from whatever pain from her head. Her head was like a balloon; she could barely feel it on her neck. She had a massive headache coming on, so all of her head was in pain, pure mind splitting pain. She sat down on one of the lawn chairs that were left on the porch, and covered her forehead with her hand and moaned in pain slightly. Shinji, seeing her in pain, bent over and felt her forehead and seeing how hot it was, went into the little apartment, and found an old towel in the bathroom and got a water bottle and poured some water on the towel to make it damp. He walked out to where she was and put it lightly on her forehead to relieve the pain. Seeing it was working by the relieved look on her face, he took off the towel and kissed her forehead softly. She opened her eyes slowly, and she had a hint of a smile on her face.  
她脸颊泛红，轻声说道：“知道可能再也见不到你那甜美的面庞，心痛至极。还有……朗基努斯之枪刺入我眼中的痛楚。”她轻抚着头上的眼罩，“依旧疼痛难忍。我能感觉到那长矛仿佛仍在我脑海中，真嗣。”她轻咳一声，触摸着发烫的额头，闭上双眼，长叹一口气，试图缓解头部的痛楚。她的头如同充气的气球，几乎感觉不到它的重量，剧烈的头痛袭来，整个头部都沉浸在撕裂般的痛苦中。她坐到门廊上遗留的一把躺椅上，用手捂住额头，轻声呻吟。真嗣见状，俯身探查她的额头，感受到那滚烫的温度后，匆匆进入狭小的公寓，从浴室找来一条旧毛巾，用水瓶中的水将其打湿。他回到她身边，轻柔地将湿毛巾敷在她的额头上以缓解疼痛。看到她脸上露出释然的表情，他知道这方法奏效了，便取下毛巾，温柔地吻了吻她的额头。她缓缓睁开眼睛，嘴角露出一丝微笑。

"What was that for?" she asked softly, not wanting to stir up any more pain in her head.  
"那是为什么？"她轻声问道，不想再激起头部的任何痛楚。

"For a sick little girl needing comfort." He smiled. She smiled back in response.  
"给一个需要安慰的小病号。"他微笑着。她也以微笑回应。

"You feeling a bit better?" he asked concerned about her health status.  
"你感觉好点了吗？"他关切地询问她的健康状况。

She nodded slowly, with a strained look on her face.  
她缓缓地点了点头，脸上带着勉强的表情。

"Much better." she breathed in sharply and held her head. Shinji immediately put the towel up to her forehead once again, and she held up her hand to hold it herself.  
"好多了。"她深吸一口气，扶着额头。真嗣立刻再次将毛巾敷在她的额头上，她则举起手自己按住。

He smiled like a parent looking down at his child. That idea came to his head. He was like her caretaker now. He was almost like Misato was. Her guardian. He thought of his responsibility, but blew off the thought that she would be a little child around him.  
"他微笑着，像父母看着自己的孩子一样。这个念头闪过他的脑海。他现在就像是她的照顾者，几乎和美里一样，是她的守护者。他想到了自己的责任，但随即抛开了她会在他面前表现得像个小孩的想法。

"Come on." He paused briefly, looking down at the pain struck girl. "Lets get you inside. You need your sleep. You definitely need it."  
"来吧。" 他停顿了一下，低头看着那个痛苦中的女孩。"我们进去吧。你需要休息。你绝对需要。"

She opened her eyes slowly and coughed, getting a little bit of her pride back, but lashing out at him in an unkind way. He took her arm and as he did she pulled away coldly.  
她缓缓睁开眼睛，咳嗽了一声，恢复了一点自尊，但对他却以不友善的方式反击。他伸手去扶她，而她却冷冷地甩开了他的手。

"I don't need your help! I am perfectly capable of getting up by myself!" she got up and she was in visible pain, but she didn't really care. As she was sitting there, she had just gotten a bitter taste of reality.  
"我不需要你的帮助！我自己完全可以站起来！" 她站了起来，明显感到疼痛，但她并不在乎。坐在那里，她刚刚尝到了现实的苦涩。

He remembered the way she used to be. Then he wanted to make things clear.  
他记得她曾经的模样。然后，他想要把事情说清楚。  
"Asuka." He said in a stern voice to get her attention and keep it towards him. She turned around with a normal look on her face.  
“明日香。”他用严肃的声音唤她，以吸引她的注意并让她面向自己。她转过身来，脸上带着平常的表情。

"What?" she put her remaining hand on her hip.  
“怎么了？”她将剩下的那只手放在腰间。

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"I want you to know, I like you like this. Being nice to me, but being you still. You know and I know that you don't like yelling."  
我想让你知道，我喜欢你这样。对我好，但仍然保持你的本色。你知道，我也知道，你不喜欢大喊大叫。

She knew he was right.  
她知道他是对的。

"What's your point?" "你的重点是什么？"

"Please live with it, live with me. For who you are, I lo-" he stopped in mid-sentence because he was about to spill his secret to her.  
""请接受它，和我一起生活。因为你是谁，我……"" 他话说到一半突然停住，因为他差点向她泄露了自己的秘密。

"What… what was that?" "那……那是什么？"

He sighed. He might as well get this over with now.  
他叹了口气。他还是现在就把这事了结了吧。

"I love you for that. More than a brother or sister would love each other. More than a mother would love her child, probably more then anything in the world. I love you. Even though you don't love me back, I'll get over it. Just live with it. You know, if we are supposed to live together, alone for a long time, I suppose the only good thing is to just get…" he was caught off guard with Asuka kissing him passionately on the lips. This kiss was much better than the one before. That kiss where she had been holding his nose. Not that comfortable for poor Shinji. They continued this for a couple of minutes, and when they had to get air, mostly Shinji because he could barely register this in his mind. When they finally broke apart, he finished his sentence.  
“我爱你，超越了兄弟姐妹之间的爱。可能比母亲爱她的孩子还要深，或许是世界上任何事物都无法比拟的。我爱你。即使你不爱我，我也会挺过去的。就接受这个事实吧。你知道，如果我们注定要长时间单独生活在一起，我想唯一的好事就是……”他突然被明日香热情地吻住了嘴唇，打断了他的话。这个吻比之前的那个好多了。之前那个吻时她还在捏着他的鼻子，对可怜的真嗣来说并不舒服。他们继续吻了几分钟，当他们需要呼吸时，主要是真嗣，因为他几乎无法在脑海中处理这一切。当他们最终分开时，他完成了他的句子。

"Along." he still had a surprised look on his face. He was astonished with the action that just went on a few seconds ago.  
“继续。”他脸上仍然带着惊讶的表情。他对刚才几秒钟内发生的事情感到震惊。

"I love you, too, but I'm sorry. I have always been so stubborn when it comes to loving someone. Since I lost most of the people I loved, I was afraid to love again. Since you and I are the only people left on the Earth, I suppose it was meant to be." She smiled casually and laid down on the bed.  
"我也爱你，但对不起。我在爱一个人这件事上一直很固执。自从我失去了大部分所爱之人后，我害怕再次去爱。既然你我成了地球上仅存的人类，我想这或许就是命中注定。" 她随意地笑了笑，躺在了床上。

"Now, if you don't mind leaving, I think this girl needs her beauty sleep." She giggled.  
"现在，如果你不介意离开的话，我想这位姑娘需要她的美容觉了。" 她咯咯笑道。

"I don't think you need it one bit."  
"我看你一点也不需要。"

She blushed. The third time he had ever seen her done that. He was sure that she meant for him to scram for her to think. So he took the hint and left giving her a kiss on her forehead when she was all settled into the bed.  
她脸红了。这是他第三次见她这样。他确信她是想让他离开，好让她思考。于是他领会了暗示，离开时在她安顿在床上后，轻轻吻了吻她的额头。  
That night was quiet because Asuka was sleeping calmly in their new bed. It wasn't that bad out, so Shinji fell asleep on one of the lawn chairs that were on the balcony. In the morning Asuka was the first to wake. She opened her eyes groggily. She yawned and slowly and cautiously got out of bed not to whack any of her injuries that she had. Or to make any more injuries that she will by carrying around with her for a pretty long time. She yawned again and starting searching the little house for her partner. She smiled finally reaching the balcony and seeing him fast asleep. She walked up to him quietly and starting kissing him behind his ear. She purred softly into it, trying to wake him up slowly and sexily. It was a good way to get up in the morning.  
那晚很安静，因为明日香在新床上平静地睡着了。外面情况并不糟糕，所以真嗣就在阳台的一把躺椅上睡着了。早晨，明日香是第一个醒来的。她睡眼惺忪地睁开眼睛，打了个哈欠，小心翼翼地从床上爬起来，以免碰到任何伤口，或是造成更多需要长时间携带的新伤。她又打了个哈欠，开始在小屋里寻找她的伴侣。最终，她微笑着来到阳台，看到他正熟睡。她轻手轻脚地走近他，开始在他耳后亲吻。她轻声呜咽，试图缓慢而性感地唤醒他。这是早晨起床的好方式。

He mumbled something and opened his eyes slowly, trying to avoid the most light that he could get in them. He yawned and looked to see her smiling next to him.  
他含糊地说了些什么，慢慢睁开眼睛，尽量避开直射的光线。他打了个哈欠，转头看到她正微笑着站在他旁边。

"Morning sleepyhead." "早上好，小懒虫。"

"Morning beautiful." She blushed once again. "What do you feel like doing today?" she asked. She was hoping for something, well, if you were her, what would that something be? As I was saying, she was hoping for that 'oh so special' something but he thought of another idea.  
"早上好，美人。" 她再次脸红，问道："今天你想做点什么？" 她心里期待着某种特别的安排，如果你是她，你会期待什么呢？正如我所说，她期待着那种'非常特别'的事情，但他却想到了另一个主意。

"You remember before when you said about going to NERV HQ?" Her mood dampened, she wanted to have some fun, not remember tragic events that took place only a few nights before.  
"你还记得之前提到要去 NERV 总部的事吗？" 她的心情顿时低落，她本想找点乐子，而不是回忆起几天前发生的悲剧。

"Yeah." she said almost silently.  
"嗯。" 她几乎无声地说道。

"Why don't we check that out? You know, see if anything of ours is still there. Or anything for that matter."  
"要不我们去看看？你知道的，看看有没有我们的东西还留在那儿。或者看看有没有其他什么东西。"

"Right." She agreed and whispered something in his ear. He blushed a dark red and chuckled softly.  
"好的。" 她同意了，并在他耳边低语了几句。他脸红得像熟透的苹果，轻声笑了起来。

She left the room and they got ready to go to NERV HQ. Shortly after, about an hour to be exact, they were on their way to the triangular shaped building that destroyed some people's lives. An uneasy topic came up.  
她离开了房间，他们准备前往 NERV 总部。不久后，确切地说大约一个小时，他们正前往那座三角形建筑，那里摧毁了一些人的生活。一个令人不安的话题被提了出来。

"Since, uh, I was in the coma. What happened with the 17th angel? I heard it was really bad for you."  
呃，自从我昏迷以来，第十七使徒发生了什么？我听说那对你来说真的很糟糕。

Shinji stopped right in his tracks; he hadn't known that she knew about it. Besides, he was simply surprised that she actually brought the topic up in the first place.  
真嗣突然停下脚步；他不知道她已经知道了这件事。此外，他只是惊讶她竟然首先提出了这个话题。

"Um, yeah." "嗯，是的。"

"What was the name of it again?" she paused, trying to remember, "Ka… Kaworu? Or something like that."  
"它叫什么名字来着？" 她停顿了一下，努力回忆，"卡…卡沃鲁？还是类似的什么。"

"Yes, that was his name. He was the pilot that… replaced you."  
"对，那是他的名字。他就是那个…取代了你的驾驶员。"

"He was in _my_ unit two? _Mine?_"  
"他在我的二号机里？我的？"

"Calm down, Asuka. He just used it to fight against me."  
"冷静点，明日香。他只是用它来对抗我而已。"

She thought about it for a second.  
她想了一下。

"I think I remember something. It was vague, but I could hear you saying something to me. I think it was another I'm sorry, Asuka, but it was for a reason. Did you actually say something to me?"  
"我觉得我记得一些事情。虽然模糊，但我能听到你对我说了些什么。我想那又是一句对不起，明日香，但这次是有原因的。你真的对我说了什么吗？"

He nodded. "Yea, because I had to fight it and somehow I knew I was fighting you on some basis."  
他点了点头。“嗯，因为我必须与之战斗，不知怎的我知道我是在某种程度上与你对抗。”

She nodded in reply. "I see." She looked at something that caught her eye. "Is that NERV?"  
她点头回应。“我明白了。”她看向吸引她注意的东西。“那是 NERV 吗？”

"Looks it, let's go check it out. Now, if it IS actually NERV, don't be scared. A lot of killing went on. Along with my father, Misato, Ritsuko, and mostly everyone, including Maya, Hyuuga, and Makoto."  
"看起来是这样，我们去看看吧。如果那里真的是 NERV，别害怕。那里发生了很多杀戮。包括我的父亲，还有美里、律子，以及几乎所有人，包括玛雅、日向和真嗣。"

She gasped. "Did you see them all get killed?"  
她倒吸一口凉气。“你看到他们都被杀了吗？”

"No. Only Misato." "没有。只看到了美里。"

Tears stung her eyes. 泪水刺痛了她的双眼。

"M-Misato?" “M-美里？”

He nodded sadly. 他悲伤地点了点头。

"She got shot by one of the men that were running around NERV killing everyone in sight. They were going to get me, but Misato got them first."  
"她被 NERV 里四处杀人的一个男子射中了。他们本来要来杀我，但 Misato 先发制人了。"

"God, how I miss everybody… Hikari, even the two other stooges... I miss everything, even homework! Well, not so much homework. I mean, I miss how the world was. I wish we were normal! Like nothing of this had happened!" While she was ranting and raving Shinji thought about it for a second. What if he was normal? What would it be like? Somewhat he wished he were normal, not losing his mother in a freak accident, having to fight monstrous beings called angels; he could have been a normal child. But he probably wouldn't have met Asuka. So, he was somewhat happy with not being normal. But, she would have the most grief, her mother.  
"天啊，我多么想念大家…Hikari，甚至是另外两个傻瓜…我怀念一切，甚至是作业！好吧，作业倒不是那么想念。我是说，我怀念那个世界的样子。真希望我们能正常！就像这一切都没发生过一样！" 在她发泄情绪时，Shinji 思考了一会儿。如果他是正常人会怎样？那会是什么感觉？他有点希望自己是正常的，不用因为一场意外失去母亲，不用与被称为使徒的怪物战斗；他本可以是个普通的孩子。但他可能就不会遇到 Asuka 了。所以，他对于不正常的生活也有一丝庆幸。但 Asuka 会是最痛苦的，她的母亲。

He trailed off in thought because he never actually got the whole story, only a little bit when Asuka told him she was talking to her step-mother on the phone. He never knew what happened with her. He heard rumors that she had killed herself, and Asuka herself witnessed it. It must have been horrible. It was to be said that he actually witnessed his mother's disappearance.  
他陷入了沉思，因为他从未真正了解整个故事，只知道 Asuka 在电话里和她继母交谈时透露的一点点。他不知道她母亲发生了什么。他听到的传闻是她自杀了，而 Asuka 亲眼目睹了这一切。那一定很可怕。据说，他亲眼见证了自己母亲的消失。

"Me too." he finally agreed. "I wish I was normal."  
"我也是。"他最终同意道。"我希望我是正常的。"

She nodded. They finally reached what they thought NERV was. They gasped at how many corpses were surrounding the rubble that was a building that where they used to work. Asuka looked at it in awe.  
她点了点头。他们终于到达了他们认为的 NERV 所在地。看到围绕着废墟——那曾是他们工作的大楼——的众多尸体，他们倒吸一口凉气。明日香惊讶地看着这一切。

"Do you think this is NERV?"  
"你觉得这是 NERV 吗？"

He nodded. "Yea. I saw it just before, you know."  
他点了点头。“嗯，我刚才看到了，你知道的。”

"Yeah." she looked at the corpses on the ground and shuddered. "Are you sure you want to do this, Shinji?" she said afraid of what might happen.  
“嗯。”她看着地上的尸体，不禁打了个寒颤。“你真的确定要这么做吗，真嗣？”她害怕可能发生的事情。

"It was your idea in the first place." He reminded her.  
“这本来就是你的主意。”他提醒她。

"Yeah. I know. Does it have to be so scary?"  
嗯，我知道。非得这么吓人吗？

He shrugged and continued walking to the building. She felt scared being left alone, so she quickly got caught up with him.  
他耸了耸肩，继续向大楼走去。她害怕独自一人，于是赶紧追上了他。

"You know." he said without looking back at her totally forgetting about her obsession with Kaji a while back, "we never did find out what happened to Kaji."  
你知道的。"他没有回头看她，完全忘记了她之前对卡吉的迷恋，"我们始终没弄清楚卡吉到底怎么了。

She stopped where she was walking and turned around. He noticed something wrong and turned around himself.  
她停下了脚步，转过身来。他察觉到异样，也跟着转了过来。

"What's wrong?" “怎么了？”

"Kaji." her shoulders began to move up and down as she started sobbing in memory of her beloved crush.  
“卡吉。”她的肩膀开始上下起伏，随着对心爱之人的回忆，她开始啜泣起来。

"Sorry. I forgot." "对不起，我忘了。"

She sniffed, "It's ok." 她吸了吸鼻子，"没关系。"

"I know it's not. Just come on and lets investigate." He said while taking her hand and guiding her to the entrance.  
"我知道不是的。快来，我们一起调查。" 他说着，牵起她的手，引导她走向入口。

They walked into the building, seeing all the decapitated persons lying on the ground, Asuka grasped onto Shinji's arm tightly, trying to avoid any harm that might come her way. They finally reached the entrance where you are supposed to slide your I.D. tag and gain access. Shinji remembered how they got to the base when the power was out. He quickly pointed that out to her and went up to the door. Seeing she couldn't turn the wheel without both of her arms and any strength whatsoever, she stood back and watched.  
他们走进大楼，看到所有被斩首的人躺在地上，明日香紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂，试图避免任何可能降临到她身上的伤害。他们终于到达了入口，那里应该刷身份卡才能进入。真嗣记得在停电时他们是如何到达基地的。他迅速向她指出这一点，并走向门口。看到她无法用双臂和任何力气转动轮子，她退后一步，观望起来。

She could feel something again. Something that would have given help to her for a while now, but she had lost it when she was battling the rest of the EVA series. Her eye. Since it has been around a week since she was attacked. She could feel her eye open. Normally. So that she could see out of it once again.  
她再次感受到了某种东西。那是她一直以来都希望能得到帮助的东西，但在与剩余的 EVA 系列战斗时失去了。她的眼睛。自从被攻击以来已经过去大约一周了。她能感觉到她的眼睛再次正常睁开，这样她又能看见了。  
"Shinji." she whispered. “真嗣。”她低声说道。

"Hmm?" he turned around and looked at her.  
"嗯？" 他转过身来看着她。

"I. I am going to try to take the eye patch off. So, if it looks kind of demented, tell me. Okay?"  
"我...我要试着把眼罩摘下来。所以，如果看起来有点吓人，告诉我。好吗？"

He nodded in response as she started to peel the eye patch off. Her eye didn't look injured at all. Her eyelid was closed to avoid any harm from sunlight.  
他点头回应，她开始慢慢揭下眼罩。她的眼睛看起来完全没有受伤。为了防止阳光伤害，她的眼皮紧闭着。

She closed both of her eyes and said to Shinji in a calm voice,  
她闭上双眼，用平静的声音对真嗣说，

"Okay. I'm going to open it now." she opened both of her eyes and looked at Shinji. Who just looked back at her and smiled.  
“好了，我现在要睁开眼睛了。”她睁开双眼，望向真嗣。他只是回望着她，微笑着。

"Anything messed up at all?" she asked scared of what his answer might be. She still wanted to look normal in the eyes of her true love. Even though she wouldn't admit that yet. She was still trying to get over the whole, 'I'm one of the last people on Earth and I got left with him, out of all people.' Millions of questions soared through her head. Like, how would they survive? Would they ever see their friends again? How would they recreate the world that was destroyed before their very own eyes? How would they do it? Would they survive the next day? A year? Even a month? The most important question they went through her head. Will I ever be able to take a shower again? She drifted back to reality and Shinji was calling her name.  
“有什么不对劲的地方吗？”她害怕地问道，担心他的回答。她仍然希望在自己的真爱眼中保持正常。尽管她还不愿承认这一点。她仍在努力克服那种‘我是地球上最后的人之一，偏偏和他一起被留下’的感觉。无数问题在她脑海中飞驰：他们将如何生存？他们还能见到朋友吗？他们将如何重建那在他们眼前被摧毁的世界？他们将如何做到？他们能活过明天吗？一年？甚至一个月？最重要的问题在她脑海中闪过：我还能再洗澡吗？她回到现实，真嗣正在呼唤她的名字。

"Asuka? Asuka!" "明日香？明日香！"

She shook her head to snap herself out of her trance. "So-Sorry... drifted off there."  
她摇了摇头，试图从恍惚中清醒过来。“抱歉...刚才走神了。”

"You scared the shit out of me!"  
"你吓死我了！"

She bowed her head down, "Sorry!" she said with true feeling.  
她低下头，"对不起！"她带着真挚的情感说道。

He smiled seeing that she was okay, he replied, "It's all right. I opened the door."  
看到她没事，他微笑着回答，"没关系。是我开的门。"

She looked over to the open door and to the man who opened it for her.  
她望向敞开的门，以及为她开门的那个男人。

She smiled fluttering her eyes, "Thanks, idiot."  
她眨着眼微笑道：“谢谢，傻瓜。”

He laughed at that because she hadn't called him that for so long.  
他因此笑了起来，因为她已经很久没有这样称呼他了。

They walked through the place, stepping over lifeless corpses, Asuka almost gagging at the sight of one.  
他们穿行于此地，跨过一具具无生命的尸体，明日香几乎因为看到其中一具而作呕。

"Shinji!" she pointed to a body after closing her eyes.  
"真嗣！" 她闭上眼睛，指向一具身体。  
He gasped as he saw who it was. Misato.  
他倒吸一口凉气，看清了那人是谁。是美里。

He looked over and saw that the elevator was there. Where they shared an 'adult' kiss, and where she pushed him off to safety. He felt tears stinging his eyes. He heard sobbing and saw Asuka fall to her knees and cry in mourning for their deceased guardian. He starting crying as well, he hadn't cried since they were at the deserted beach, he felt sorry now too.  
他转头一看，电梯就在那里。那是他们分享成人之吻的地方，也是她将他推向安全的地方。他感到泪水刺痛了眼睛。他听到啜泣声，看到明日香跪倒在地，为已故的监护人哀悼而哭泣。他也开始哭泣，自从他们在荒凉的海滩上之后，他就再也没有哭过，现在他也感到内疚。

He could hear Asuka muttering, "Why did you have to go? You were like another mother to me." she started to cry uncontrollably.  
他能听到明日香喃喃自语，“你为什么要走？你对我来说就像另一个母亲。”她开始无法控制地哭泣。

Shinji leaned over and started to pull Asuka up onto her feet. He tried to comfort her.  
真嗣俯身开始将明日香扶起来。他试图安慰她。

"Come on, Asuka. We should leave. She's in a better place now."  
“来吧，明日香。我们该走了。她现在在一个更好的地方。”

"With all of the other people I love! All except you!"  
"和我所爱的其他人一起！除了你！"

"She died taking a bullet in her arm for me. It was my fault. I should have gotten to the cage earlier."  
"她为了我挡了一枪，牺牲了。是我的错。我本应该早点到达那个笼子的。"

"It's not your fault. She chose to save you."  
"这不是你的错。她选择救你。"

"But she was our guardian. She had to do it."  
"但她曾是我们的守护者，她必须这么做。"

"No she didn't, she was more of a guardian to us. She was like a mother. She was kind and considerate. She was always in control. I was never, and neither were you. She was the real boss."  
"不，她对我们来说远不止是一个守护者。她就像我们的母亲，既慈爱又体贴，总是掌控着一切。你我从未如此，她才是真正的掌舵人。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"She loved us, cared for us. Do you think the wanted to take us in to live with her in the first place?"  
"她爱我们，关心我们。你认为她一开始就想收留我们，和我们一起生活吗？"

"No."

"True, but she grew to love us."  
"确实，但她后来爱上了我们。"

"Yes." He nodded knowing that was the truth. "Lets go. We should investigate more."  
"是的。" 他点头表示认同这个事实。"我们走吧。应该再深入调查一下。"

"All right." She agreed while following him through the hallways.  
"好的。" 她一边答应着，一边跟着他穿过走廊。

They walked and walked for around twenty minutes, when Asuka asked Shinji a question to break the silence.  
他们走了大约二十分钟，这时明日香为了打破沉默，向真嗣提出了一个问题。

"Do you know what day it is today?"  
"你知道今天是什么日子吗？"

"Not sure. I know it's November. That's all."  
"不太确定。我知道是十一月。仅此而已。"

"Oh, okay. Is it past the 24th?"  
"哦，好的。那已经过了 24 号吗？"  
"Most likely, why?" "很可能，怎么了？"

"No reason." "没有理由。"

"No, why?" "不，为什么？"

"I wanted to know if I'm 16 or not."  
"我想知道我是不是 16 岁。"

"Oh. I know for a fact I am, not sure about you though, maybe we can find something out."  
"哦，我确信我是，但至于你嘛，就不太确定了，或许我们可以查个究竟。"

She nodded and they made it to central dogma.  
她点头同意，随后他们抵达了中央教条区。

If this was a month ago, they would have had a special pass to get through the door, but now, the door was so loose Shinji just kicked it down. He had gotten stronger, Asuka observed. She was noticing all new things about him. She noticed something that she was not supposed to, something very 'prized' to a man if you catch my drift.  
如果是一个月前，他们本可以凭借特别通行证通过那扇门，但现在，门已经松动到真嗣一脚就能踹开。他变强了，明日香观察到。她开始注意到他身上的新变化。她注意到了一些本不该注意的东西，对男人来说极为珍贵的东西，你懂我的意思吧。

They walked into the room where Rei was born. Asuka looked around suspiciously.  
他们走进了绫波丽出生的房间。明日香怀疑地环顾四周。

"You walk these rooms like you know where you are going."  
你走这些房间的样子，好像你知道你要去哪儿似的。

"I do. Ritsuko took me and Misato down here a while back."  
我确实知道。之前赤木博士带我和美里来过这里。

"Why didn't I come?" “为什么我没来？”

"Coma." 昏迷。

She nodded. 她点了点头。

"Why does this place look eerily familiar?"  
"为什么这个地方看起来如此熟悉得令人不安？"

"This is where Rei was born, or should I say, created."  
"这里是绫出生的地方，或者我应该说，是被创造出来的地方。"

"Created?" "被创造？"

"Yeah, she… wasn't that human."  
"是啊，她……不那么像人类。"

"What? I knew something was wrong with that girl from day one!"  
"什么？我从第一天起就觉得那女孩有问题！"

He shook his head at her sudden outburst.  
他对她突然的爆发摇了摇头。

"We need to continue on. Lets go."  
"我们得继续前进。走吧。"

They walked trough the rooms where the many Rei clones used to be. Then they finally got to the room where Adam, the first angel was before Rei combined with it to make a super natural being. They saw a blonde scientist's lifeless body laying in the LCL. Asuka gasped.  
他们穿过了那些曾经安置众多绫波复制体的房间。最终，他们到达了亚当，即第一使徒所在的房间，之前绫波与之融合，形成了一个超自然存在。他们看到一位金发科学家的尸体无生命地躺在 LCL 中。明日香倒吸一口凉气。

"Ritsuko." "律子。"

"Come on, lets see where other." he trailed off looking back at Asuka trying to get into a coffin-like crate.  
"来吧，看看其他地方。"他回头看着明日香，她正试图钻进一个棺材般的箱子里。

"I know he's in there! I can feel it!"  
"我知道他在里面！我能感觉到！"

"Who?" "谁？"

She opened it and immediately fell onto her knees.  
她打开门，立刻跪倒在地。

"Get me out of here Shinji. I can't stand being here anymore."  
把我从这里弄出去，真嗣。我再也受不了待在这里了。

"What has gotten you so..." he trailed off, seeing Kaji's corpse in it. His body covered with a type on blanket, his face, looking serene and peaceful.  
"你这是怎么了……" 他话没说完，就看到了里面的加持尸体。他的身体被一条毯子覆盖着，面容安详平和。

"Come on Asuka. We need to get out of here." He noticed that she was lying on the floor. "Asuka?" he noticed she had either fainted or passed out. He decided that it was too much for her and him himself so he picked her up and traveled out of the retched building that maimed their lives forever. When he finally found his way back to their little apartment, he was exhausted with carrying her because she had gained some weight since when they left, or it was just his arms giving out on him. He went into the house and laid her down on their bed. He glanced down at his sleeping beauty. He leaned over and kissed her lightly on the lips and looked over her. She was a beautiful young woman. She had legs that could go for miles, beautiful hair, thighs, eyes, lips… breasts. He blushed at the thought. He knew he was still the same when it came to her. He still loved every inch of her. Even when she was bossy and always pissed off all the time, he still loved that little girl that was abandoned when she gained her ego. Even when she was teasing him with thermal expansion, he knew she got a kick out of insulting him and that boosted her ego, he let her do it even though it hurt him in the process. He didn't like it when Touji or Kensuke called her a demon and other nasty insults. He still enjoyed her presence. He stood watching her for a couple more minutes and then he went onto the little balcony and sat down on one of the chairs. He thought about their trip back to NERV HQ. He wondered how it stayed in almost perfect condition after 3rd impact. He had a sudden urge to go check on Asuka. He had a feeling she was up already. He heard drawers open and drawers close, he walked into the room to find a half naked Asuka. Her back was to him so she couldn't see him. But she heard him come in, and she wasn't insecure about having him watch her change into some other clothes that the woman had here before. It looked like a married couple used to live there before the 3rd impact. She finally spoke to him and turned around. Giving him a full frontal view.  
“来吧，明日香，我们得离开这里。”他注意到她躺在地板上，“明日香？”他意识到她要么是昏迷了，要么是晕过去了。他觉得这对她和他自己来说都太过沉重，于是抱起她，离开了那个永远毁掉他们生活的可憎建筑。当他终于找到回他们小公寓的路时，他因为抱着她而筋疲力尽，因为她自从离开后似乎变重了，或者只是他的手臂支撑不住了。他走进屋子，将她安置在床上。他低头看着沉睡中的美人，俯身轻吻她的唇，然后凝视着她。她是个美丽的年轻女子，拥有修长的双腿，秀发，大腿，眼睛，嘴唇……还有胸部。想到这些，他不禁脸红。他知道自己对她的感情依旧如初，依然爱着她的每一寸。即使她霸道，总是怒气冲冲，他仍然爱着那个在获得自我意识后被遗弃的小女孩。 即便她用热胀冷缩来戏弄他，他也知道她从中获得了贬低他的快感，这让她的自尊心得到了满足，他任由她这么做，尽管这让他感到痛苦。他不喜欢当东治或健介称她为恶魔或其他恶毒的侮辱。他仍然享受她的陪伴。他站在那里多看了她几分钟，然后走到小阳台上，坐在其中一把椅子上。他回想起他们返回 NERV 总部的旅程。他好奇在第三次冲击后，它是如何几乎完好无损的。他突然有种冲动想去看看明日香。他有种预感她已经醒了。他听到抽屉开合的声音，走进房间，发现半裸的明日香。她的背对着他，所以她看不见他。但她听到了他进来，她并不介意他在一旁看着她换上这里之前那位女士留下的其他衣服。看起来在第三次冲击之前，这里曾住着一对夫妇。她终于开口和他说话，并转过身来，让他得以一览无余。

"Uh." he said while staring right at her breasts.  
他盯着她的胸部，说道：“呃。”

She shook her head. 她摇了摇头。  
"Silly boy." She slid on a shirt and pants. They were a little big, but anything would do. Plus, she needed a nice warm bath. She yawned and stretched. She looked at Shinji blushing furiously and looking away.  
"傻小子。" 她套上一件衬衫和裤子，虽然有点大，但总比没有好。而且，她迫切需要一个热水澡。她打了个哈欠，伸了个懒腰。看着真嗣满脸通红，尴尬地转过头去。

She new he wanted her, in more ways than one. She wanted him too. Then an idea came into her head.  
她知道他渴望她，不仅仅是表面上的那种。她对他也有同样的感觉。这时，一个主意闪过她的脑海。

"Shinji? How much water did you get?"  
"真嗣？你弄了多少水回来？"

"A whole shopping cart full or it, because I didn't want to go back there for a while."  
"一整购物车都是，因为我暂时不想再回那里了。"

"Do you think we have enough water for baths?"  
"你觉得我们有足够的水洗澡吗？"

"One I think. Not two."  
"我想只够一个人用。两个人就不行了。"

"Oh... well that won't be a problem."  
"哦... 那应该不是问题。"

"You can take a bath. I know you love being in a quiet place for a while. I'm going to go out and look around for a while. Ok?"  
"你可以去洗澡。我知道你喜欢在安静的地方待一会儿。我要出去转转。好吗？"

He nodded. Somewhat unsure of his decision to let her go, but he really wanted to take a bath. Only if he had his SDAT player.  
他点了点头。有些不确定是否该让她离开，但他真的很想洗澡。只要他有他的 SDAT 播放器就好了。

She walked up the hill to where their apartment was before. She saw where the apartment was and she also saw that she could get to their stuff easily. She could get her clothes, his, and some food and something special for him.  
她沿着小山坡走向他们曾经的公寓。她看到了那座公寓，也意识到自己可以轻松地取回他们的物品。她能拿到自己的衣服，他的，还有一些食物，以及为他准备的特别之物。

She walked up the stairs instead of using the elevator because the electricity was gone and she couldn't get up there anyway. She got to their apartment and she had found the spare key to the apartment, slid it in the slot, and the door popped open.  
她选择走楼梯而非乘坐电梯，因为停电了，无论如何她都无法乘电梯上去。她到达了他们的公寓，找到了备用钥匙，将其插入锁孔，门便应声而开。

She walked inside, making sure not to disturb anything, and she walked into her old room. She noticed nothing had moved whatsoever. She grabbed a bag and started shoving some of her clothes in there. Including some shirts, pants, underwear and bras. She also slid in a thong that she had bought in Germany just for fun. She also took some of her most prized possessions: some photos, her diary, and other stuff. She left her room and went into Shinji's. She saw his SDAT player on his table with his headphones attached. She took some of his clothes. She took some of his underwear too, a battery-powered lamp on his desk and left his room. She wanted to take his cello but she didn't have the strength carry it back to their other apartment. She went back into his room and took a watch that was on his desk and left. She went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator and took out most of the food that was in there. She even took a couple beers for the hell of it. She finished and went back into her room to see if she forgot anything important. She put of some socks and sneakers that she had and took off her plug suit completely and got more comfortable without it on. She looked around and grabbed a pack of batteries so that if Shinji's SDAT player's batteries died, they'd always had spares. She didn't know if she would have the strength to bring all of that stuff home. But she knew she had to. She went into the bathroom and got some soap, shampoo, conditioner, a razor, to shave her legs no doubt, and some shaving cream. She left the bathroom and had everything in cloth bags so she knew that they wouldn't rip apart before she got back. Back at the other apartment, Shinji was getting worried. He had been in the bathtub for around a half hour he thought and no sign of Asuka whatsoever. He decided to stay calm, knowing that she would be okay. Soon after he heard the door open and close. He jumped out of the bath to see her in and help her with anything. He forgot one detail.  
她轻手轻脚地走进屋内，确保不触动任何物品，径直来到自己的旧房间。环顾四周，一切如故，未曾挪动分毫。她拿起一个包，开始往里塞衣物，包括几件衬衫、裤子、内衣和胸罩。还顺手塞进了一条在德国买的丁字裤，纯粹为了好玩。此外，她带走了一些珍贵的物品：几张照片、日记本及其他小物件。离开自己的房间，她走进了真嗣的房间。桌上放着他的 SDAT 播放器，耳机也挂在上面。她拿走了他的一些衣物，包括内衣，还有桌上的电池灯，然后离开了他的房间。本想带走他的大提琴，但实在无力搬回另一个公寓。她再次返回真嗣的房间，取走了桌上的手表，随即离开。她又进入厨房，打开冰箱，取出了大部分食物，甚至顺手拿了几罐啤酒，纯粹出于兴致。收拾完毕后，她回到自己的房间检查是否遗漏了重要物品。她脱下插头服，换上几双袜子和运动鞋，让自己更舒适些。 她环顾四周，抓起一包电池，以便万一真嗣的 SDAT 播放器电池耗尽，他们总有备用。她不知道自己是否有力气把这些东西全部带回家。但她知道她必须这么做。她走进浴室，拿了些肥皂、洗发水、护发素、剃须刀，无疑是用来刮腿毛的，还有些剃须膏。她离开浴室，把所有东西都装进了布袋里，这样她就知道在回家之前它们不会撕裂。回到另一个公寓，真嗣开始担心起来。他已经在浴缸里待了大约半个小时，却丝毫不见明日香的踪影。他决定保持冷静，知道她会没事的。不久后，他听到门开了又关。他从浴缸里跳出来，想看看她并帮她拿东西。他却忽略了一个细节。

"Put a towel on, idiot!" she threw him one that she had grabbed back at the other apartment and he quickly wrapped it around his waist.  
“把毛巾披上，笨蛋！”她扔给他一条在另一个公寓拿的毛巾，他迅速将其围在腰间。

She smiled and shook her head while setting the stuff down on a table. She started unpacking her stuff and the food.  
她微笑着摇了摇头，同时将东西放在桌子上。她开始整理自己的物品和食物。

"Where did you go?" "你去哪儿了？"

"Back to the old apartment."  
"回到旧公寓了。"

"You got in there? You could have told me and we could have moved up there."  
"你进去了？你本可以告诉我，我们就可以搬到那里去了。"

"Nah, I like it better here. Nice and cozy."  
"嗯，我更喜欢这里。温馨又舒适。"

"Okay. Did you get any of my stuff?" he said hopefully.  
"好吧。你有没有拿到我的东西？" 他满怀希望地说。

"No." she shook her head.  
"没有。" 她摇了摇头。

"You didn't?" he said discouraged.  
"你没找到？" 他沮丧地说。

"I did, don't worry." She handed him the bag with his stuff in it minus his SDAT player.  
"找到了，别担心。" 她递给他装有他物品的袋子，除了他的 SDAT 播放器。

After looking through all of his stuff, not seeing his SDAT player, got kinda sad, missing it to keep him in control.  
翻遍所有东西后，没看到他的 SDAT 播放器，他感到有些难过，因为怀念它来维持自己的控制感。

"I brought you a surprise!" she said while holding two things behind her back, a thong and his SDAT player.  
"我给你带了个惊喜！" 她一边说着，一边将两样东西藏在背后，一条丁字裤和他的 SDAT 播放器。

"Pick an arm, Shinji." "选一只手吧，真嗣。"

He pointed to the right hand, which was holding the thong. She held it out and giggled.  
他指向右手，那只手正拿着丁字裤。她伸出手来，咯咯地笑了。

"Wrong hand!" "错了手！"

He blushed and pointed to her left hand, which revealed his SDAT player.  
他脸红了，指向她的左手，那只手上露出了他的 SDAT 播放器。  
"Thank you, Asuka!" he hugged her.  
"谢谢你，明日香！" 他拥抱了她。

She smiles and blushed. 她微笑着，脸颊泛起红晕。

"No problem!" “没问题！”

She took her stuff into their bedroom and put it in the dresser drawers and put all of her personal items in the drawers as well.  
她将自己的物品搬进卧室，放入衣柜抽屉中，并将所有个人物品也一并放入抽屉。

He followed her into the room and put his stuff in the drawers as well.  
他跟随她进入房间，也将自己的东西放进了抽屉里。

She went into the bathroom and put the stuff she brought it there. Then she put the food away, and came back in the room seeing Shinji lying on the bed with his eyes closed. She laid down on her side next to him, whispering in his ear,  
她走进浴室，把带来的东西放在那里。随后她把食物收好，回到房间，看到真嗣躺在床上，双眼紧闭。她侧身躺在他旁边，轻声在他耳边说：

"Wake up lover boy, I need a bath."  
“醒醒，亲爱的，我需要洗个澡。”

His eyes opened instantly, widened at the thought.  
他的眼睛立刻睁开，因这个念头而瞪大了。

"Wh-What?" he stammered. “什、什么？”他结巴地问道。

"You heard me, third child, I need a bath, and you're going to give it to me."  
“你听到了，老三，我需要洗澡，而你得帮我洗。”

He raised an eyebrow. 他挑了挑眉毛。

"Are you sure?" “你确定吗？”

She nodded and started to peel off her clothes and she starting walking to the bathroom. She walked in a slow, sexy way. Like she was a cat, reeling in her prey.  
她点了点头，开始脱下衣服，并朝着浴室走去。她走得很慢，很性感，就像一只猫，正在引诱它的猎物。

She was fully naked when she entered the bathroom, then got into the bathtub slowly. She waited as a shy Shinji followed her in. And the rest was history.  
她全身赤裸地走进浴室，然后缓缓进入浴缸。她等待着，羞涩的碇真嗣跟随她进来。之后的一切便成了历史。

They awoke on their bed, unaware of what happened last night. They thought they had had sex. But no, they actually got along for once. Like, a boyfriend should act around his girlfriend when they are madly in love. They made out for a while, while he was massaging her back after he washed her hair for her. She was asleep in his arms, sleeping like a baby, a little angel. He finally opened his eyes and looked down at his sleeping beauty. He kissed her forehead and snuggled into her. He hoped for the best to come for the future. It looked like nighttime outside, and what a night they had ahead of them. She opened her eyes and gazed into her lover's. She whispered into his ear,  
他们在床上醒来，对昨晚发生的事一无所知。他们以为发生了关系。但并非如此，他们难得地相处融洽。就像热恋中的男友对待女友那样。他们亲吻了一会儿，他为她洗完头发后，还为她按摩了背部。她在他怀里安睡，像个婴儿，一个小天使。他终于睁开眼睛，低头看着沉睡的美人。他吻了吻她的额头，依偎在她身边。他期待着未来能有最好的发展。外面看起来已是夜晚，他们即将迎来一个怎样的夜晚啊。她睁开眼睛，凝视着爱人的双眼。她在他耳边轻声说：

"I love you." "我爱你。"

"I love you too." He kissed her forehead once again.  
"我也爱你。"他又吻了吻她的额头。

"I have been thinking about it a lot. You know... us," she thought of a good way to put it, "as one."  
"我一直在反复思考这件事。你知道的...我们," 她想到了一个恰当的表达方式, "合二为一。"

"You mean… us… together... as in sex?"  
"你是说…我们…在一起…指的是性关系吗？"

She nodded sheepishly. 她羞涩地点了点头。

"Have you ever done it? There were rumors that you did."  
"你做过那事吗？有传言说你做过。"

She shook her head. 她摇了摇头。

"No, people just spread rumors to give me a bad reputation. Didn't work though."  
"没有，人们只是散布谣言来败坏我的名声。不过没成功。"

"Oh, so you're willing to… have sex with me?" He started to blush.  
"哦，所以你愿意…和我发生关系？" 他开始脸红。

She nodded. 她点了点头。

"Yeah, I really want to. I love you." she smiled innocently.  
"是的，我真的很想。我爱你。" 她天真地笑了。

"All right… even though I have no clue what I'm doing."  
"好吧…尽管我完全不知道自己在做什么。"

"It's okay." She interrupted.  
""没关系。"" 她打断道。

"Come on, then." "那就来吧。"

Then the rest was bliss. True love found.  
随后便是无尽的幸福。真爱已寻得。

The next couple of days were like this. Since there weren't any condoms around, they were taking their chances. Around a week later Asuka was getting suspicious as to what was happening inside her. So, when Shinji was sleeping, she left a note on the table and it said:  
接下来的几天都是如此。由于周围没有避孕套，他们便冒险行事。大约一周后，明日香开始怀疑自己体内发生了什么。于是，趁真嗣睡觉时，她在桌上留下了一张便条，上面写着：

Dear Shinji, 亲爱的真嗣，

I went out to go get something important. Don't be worried. I'll be back in around an hour. I would have taken you, but you looked like a little angel sleeping there and I didn't want to disturb you at all. I love you and I'll be back soon.  
我出去办点重要的事。别担心，大约一小时后就回来。本想带你一起，但看你睡得像个天使，实在不忍心打扰。我爱你，很快就回来。

- Asuka - 明日香

She placed the note down with the pen on the table and exited the apartment and heading towards the convenient store. She was hoping to find something that she really needed there. When she finally reached the store and opened the door and went in. She immediately went on her search. When she finally found what she looking for, she picked up the box and read the instructions on the back. The box she was holding was a pregnancy test. She wanted to find out that if anything that they had done created any kind of result. She opened the box and took out all of its contents and laid them on the counter. She reread the instructions carefully and did what she had to do. It told her that she had to wait a half an hour until the results were clear. In the meantime she was just walking around the store, looking at all of the stuff on shelves. She found some magazines and started to read them, they were old, but she had been in a coma, so she didn't know what was going on. She was reading quietly when the little thing beeped. She jumped up from her position on the floor, dropped the magazine she was reading, and walked very slowly to the counter. She couldn't believe what she saw. She was pregnant.  
她将便条和笔放在桌上，离开了公寓，朝便利店走去。她希望在那里找到真正需要的东西。终于到达商店，推门而入，她立刻开始了搜寻。找到目标后，她拿起盒子，阅读背面的说明。手中的是一盒验孕棒，她想知道他们的行为是否产生了任何结果。打开盒子，取出所有内容物，摆在柜台上。她仔细重读了说明，并按指示操作。结果显示需等待半小时才能清晰。在此期间，她在店内闲逛，浏览货架上的商品。发现几本杂志，便开始阅读，虽已过时，但她曾昏迷，对时事一无所知。静静阅读时，那小物件发出哔声。她从地上跳起，丢下杂志，缓缓走向柜台。眼前所见，令她难以置信。 她怀孕了。

She didn't know that having sex only four times could do it, but unfortunately it had. She thought of a way to tell Shinji, but then she thought, let him figure it out. After a couple of minutes she thought that was mean and that she would try to tell him the best she could when she got home. When she left the store and started walking back, she started to think of good explanations for what had just happened. She thought he might have been worried because she had brought his watch with her and she had been gone longer than she said she would. She quickened her pace and got back to the apartment in a half an hour. She opened the door cautiously and peeked in. Seeing that the coast was clear, she snuck into the bedroom, only to see Shinji looking up at her, looking very worried.  
她没想到仅有的四次性行为就导致了怀孕，但不幸的是确实如此。她想好了如何告诉真嗣，但转念一想，让他自己猜去吧。过了几分钟，她觉得这样太刻薄了，决定回家后尽量好好告诉他。离开商店往回走时，她开始思考如何解释刚刚发生的事情。她想真嗣可能会担心，因为她带走了他的手表，而且她离开的时间比预计的要长。她加快了脚步，半小时后回到了公寓。她小心翼翼地打开门，探头一看。见四周无人，她悄悄溜进卧室，却看到真嗣抬头望着她，满脸担忧。

"Where were you?" he asked.  
“你去哪儿了？”他问道。

"I was down at that little store a whiles away."  
"我去了离这儿不远的那家小店。"

"Oh, you could've said that you'd be back in two hours."  
"哦，你本可以说你要两个小时后才回来。"

"Something came up, I had to stay a bit longer."  
"临时有点事，我得待久一点。"

"What did you do there?"  
"你在那里做了什么？"

She paused trying to think of something she did besides that pregnancy test.  
她停顿了一下，试图想起除了那个怀孕测试之外她还做了些什么。

"I was looking around, reading a few magazines."  
"我四处看了看，翻阅了几本杂志。"

"That all?" 就这些？

"No." she looked away from him.  
"不。" 她避开他的目光。

"I had this feeling, and I wanted to go check it out, and when I was proved right I didn't know what to do, so I was hiding out there until I could think of a good explanation. I haven't thought of one yet!" she sat on the bed next to him.  
"我有一种感觉，想去查个究竟，当我证实了自己的猜测后，却不知道该怎么办，所以就躲在那里，直到想出一个合理的解释。但我现在还没想出来！" 她坐在他旁边的床上。

"What?" he asked, dumbstruck.  
"什么？" 他惊愕地问道。

"I... I'm pregnant." "我... 我怀孕了。"

She laid back on the pillow that was behind her and covered her face with it.  
她向后靠在枕头，用它遮住了脸。

"Wow." was his response. “哇。”他回应道。  
She pulled the pillow away from her face, "What?"  
她把枕头从脸上移开，“什么？”

"I think it's awesome! But the only thing is that how is it going to be born and stuff like that."  
“我觉得这太棒了！但唯一的问题是，它将如何出生以及诸如此类的事情。”

"Right... but lets not worry about that now. But really, do you really want a baby? Because I know to flush it out."  
"对...但现在先别担心那个。不过说真的，你真的想要个宝宝吗？因为我知道怎么把它弄掉。"

"No! Don't even think of that!"  
"不！连想都别想！"

He placed his hands on her shoulders and said sweetly,  
他把手放在她的肩膀上，温柔地说道，

"I love you and I would never, ever want anything bad to happen to you."  
"我爱你，我绝不会希望你遭遇任何不幸。"

She smiled. 她微笑了。

"I know… but I'm scared, that's all."  
"我知道……但我就是害怕，仅此而已。"

He smiled back. 他回以微笑。

"I hope what's to come is the same as it is now."  
“我希望即将到来的一切，都能如现在这般美好。”

He kissed her forehead and he laid himself to be next to her, and they fell asleep in each other's arms, awaiting the goodness to come for the future and beyond.  
他轻吻她的额头，然后躺下身来紧挨着她，两人相拥而眠，期待着未来及以后的美好时光。
