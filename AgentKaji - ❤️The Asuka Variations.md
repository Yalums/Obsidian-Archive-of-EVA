**Chapter 1: Asuka Strikes 第一章：明日香的出击**

---

"She's waking up." "她醒了。"

Where was she? Something tugged at her memory. The red earth beneath her feet, a cold lifeless world from horizon to horizon. But now she was somewhere else.  
她在哪儿？有什么东西在牵动她的记忆。脚下是红色的土地，从地平线到地平线，是一个寒冷而无生命的世界。但现在她在别处。

She feigned sleep a little longer.  
她又假装睡了一会儿。

"And the test results?" "以及检测结果呢？"

"Human." "人类。"

The words drifted over her as she slowly regained her senses. The bed was softer than she was used to. The comforting familiarity of her plugsuit replaced with something looser. _A hospital gown?_ She kept her eyes closed and listened, trying to keep her breathing steady. The conversation beside her carried on.  
当她渐渐恢复意识时，这些话语飘入她的耳中。床铺比她习惯的要柔软。熟悉的插入栓驾驶服被更宽松的东西取代了，是医院的病号服吗？她闭着眼睛，努力保持呼吸平稳，聆听着旁边的对话继续进行。

"Is she a danger?" A man's voice. It was stern and something told her she should know who he was. She tensed.  
"她是否构成威胁？" 一个男人的声音，严肃而让她觉得似乎应该知道他是谁。她紧张起来。

"We won't know until we talk to her. This is unprecedented to say the least. I've asked Major Katsuragi to bring in the Second Child as a precautionary measure." The other speaker's voice was also familiar, a woman.  
"我们得跟她谈谈才能知道。至少可以说，这是前所未有的。我已经让葛城少校将第二适格者带来，以防万一。" 另一位说话者也是个女人，声音同样熟悉。

"Good." "很好。"

_Second... Child?_ The words conjured up a collage of images and thoughts and she could feel her brow knit in concentration as she began to remember; Wille's attack on Nerv HQ, her and Mari's fight against the dual piloted Unit-13. That _brat._ And then...  
第二个...孩子？这个词唤起了一系列的画面和思绪，她感到自己的眉头紧锁，开始回忆起来；Wille 对 Nerv 总部的袭击，她和 Mari 对抗双人驾驶的 Unit-13。那个小鬼。然后...

_And then? 然后呢？_

Stranded_._ With only Shinji and the other for company as they made their journey to safety. How many days had they travelled? It didn't matter, she could have gone on. They had only stopped so she could get her bearings. It certainly didn't have anything to do with Shinji's snivelling. And his complaints about how tired he was. How hungry he was. She was getting sick of it. She sat away from that pair, the brat and the doll. They were made for each other.  
与 Shinji 和其他人一起被困，他们在前往安全的旅途中相伴。他们旅行了多少天？这并不重要，她本可以继续前行。他们停下来只是为了让她确定方向。这当然与 Shinji 的啜泣无关。还有他关于自己有多累、多饿的抱怨。她对此感到厌烦。她远离那对，那个小鬼和那个玩偶。他们真是天生一对。

_He didn't need help, it was pity he wanted. He could shove it up his-  
他不需要帮助，他想要的是怜悯。他可以把这东西塞进自己的——_

She recalled closing her eyes to drown out the soft sounds of sobbing from the kid when an overwhelming wave of tiredness hit her. The last thing she remembered before darkness claimed her was a flash of red eyes paired with the faintest of smiles.  
她回忆起自己闭上眼睛，试图屏蔽那孩子低声啜泣的声音，突然一阵强烈的疲惫感袭来。在黑暗吞噬她之前，她记得的最后一件事是一双红色的眼睛，伴随着一丝微弱的微笑。

And now she was here. _Did they find us? Have we been rescued?_ The conversation around her had ebbed into silence and lying here was going to get her nowhere. _No sleep for the wicked,_ she decided to get it over with.  
而现在她在这里。他们找到我们了吗？我们被救了吗？周围的谈话已经沉寂，躺在这里毫无进展。恶人无眠，她决定起身行动。

She bit down on her inhibition and opened her eye. And regretted the action immediately as she cursed at the harsh lighting overhead. Flinching, she turned her face aside. She ended up facing a man.  
她咬紧牙关，睁开了眼睛。随即就因为头顶刺眼的灯光而后悔不已，咒骂出声。她畏缩着，将脸转向一边，却正好面对着一个男人。

He had a beard and wore round, tinted glasses. Recognition sparked as their eyes met.  
他留着胡须，戴着圆形的墨镜。当他们的目光相遇时，她心中闪过一丝熟悉感。

Her mouth went dry as she continued to stare.  
她继续凝视着，嘴巴却变得干涩起来。

And then white, hot rage ignited within her. Before she knew it, she had risen from the bed into crouching position and then pounced at him. At least, she tried to.  
随后，一股炽烈的怒火在她心中燃起。在她意识到之前，她已经从床上蹲起，然后向他扑去。至少，她是这么尝试的。

Her legs were weaker than expected, and she only covered half the distance she had hoped. It was still enough to make him stumble as she landed at his feet, his hands coming up to defend himself. In the background she recognised the sound of a door slamming open. More voices; angry and commanding, filled the room.  
她的双腿比预想的要虚弱，只跃出了期望中一半的距离。尽管如此，她的着陆还是让他踉跄了一下，他的双手本能地举起自卫。与此同时，她听到身后门被猛地推开的声音。更多的声音涌入房间，愤怒而命令式的，充斥着整个空间。

She ignored them. 她置之不理。

She lunged at him, pushing him back to the wall with one hand holding onto his collar. She cocked back the other into a fist and growled out his name with contempt.  
她猛地扑向他，一手揪住他的衣领将他推到墙边，另一手握拳蓄力，带着轻蔑的语气低吼出他的名字。

"_Ikari."_ “碇。”

And then punched him with all her strength.  
随后用尽全力给了他一拳。

---

Misato led Asuka through the corridors of Nerv's Geofront hospital. Neither looked pleased.  
葛城美里领着明日香穿过 NERV 地下都市医院的走廊。两人都面露不悦。

Except for short, simple instructions, Misato hadn't said a word to Asuka since their arrival. Asuka was now equally silent but had spent the journey here from the apartment making it clear exactly what she thought of this little trip.  
除了简短的指示外，自从到达这里后，美里就没对明日香说过一句话。明日香现在也同样沉默，但从公寓到这里的一路上，她已经清楚地表达了对这次小旅行的看法。

_I'm an independent young women, dammit. Don't I get a say?_ She _had_ been preparing for her after-school shower when Misato had arrived and all but ordered her to Nerv HQ.  
我可是独立自主的年轻女性，该死。难道我就没有发言权吗？当美里到来时，她正准备放学后的淋浴，结果几乎是被命令前往 NERV 总部。

Asuka had not taken this well.  
明日香对此反应不佳。

Loud protestations followed throughout their journey in the car. Not even the Major's cavalier attitude towards the rules of the road was able to deter the wrath of the Second Child. Insults, insinuations and threats to both Misato and a certain 'idiot' flew sharply and swiftly.  
在车上的旅途中，伴随着大声的抗议。即使是少校对道路规则的漫不经心态度也无法阻止第二适格者的怒火。侮辱、影射和针对美里以及某个'白痴'的威胁尖锐而迅速地飞来。

As a testament to her skill as Nerv's head of Tactical Operations, Misato weaved through the streets of Tokyo-3 as she held off the verbal barrage whilst simultaneously holding a conversation on the phone with Dr. Akagi.  
作为证明她是 NERV 战术行动部门负责人的技能，美里在穿梭于第三新东京市的街道时，一边抵挡着言语的猛攻，一边同时与赤木博士通电话。

At least, Asuka assumed it was the doctor. She didn't care for the details of the conversation and it was only when she caught Rei's name mentioned did she quieten down and accept her fate. She wasn't about to let _wondergirl_ show her up in front of everyone.  
至少，明日香猜那是医生。她并不在意对话的细节，直到听到绫波的名字被提及，她才安静下来，接受了自己的命运。她可不想在大家面前让那个奇迹女孩抢了风头。

_And_ _Misato still hasn't told me why they want me here, some guardian she is!_ Her foot tapped loudly as they now stood waiting for the elevator to a different floor of the hospital.  
还有，美里还没告诉我为什么他们要我在这里，她这守护者当得真行！她的脚大声地敲打着地面，现在他们正站在医院另一层楼的电梯前等待。

The _tick, tick, tick_ of the mechanism as it counted the lift's passage through the building put Asuka further on edge.  
随着机械装置滴答滴答地记录着电梯在建筑物中的穿行，明日香越发感到不安。

_Of course,_ I _had to be picked for this little trip. Couldn't have Shinji ruin his beauty sleep. Once I'm done here I'm gonna-_  
当然，这种小旅行非得挑上我不可。总不能让真嗣毁了他的美容觉。等我这边完事了，我就要——

Shinji was spared any imaginative insults as a soft _beep_ announced the arrival of the lift. The doors opened and Asuka made a move to enter before she was abruptly stopped by Misato, who stuck out a hand. She shrugged it away, annoyance rising before seeing the reason for stopping. She didn't need to follow Misato's lead as they both hastily stepped aside. A grim-faced Commander Ikari stalked past.  
真嗣免于遭受更多想象中的侮辱，因为一声轻响宣告电梯的到来。门一开，明日香正要进去，却被美里突然伸出的手拦住了。她不耐烦地甩开，正要发火，却看到了停下的原因。无需跟随美里的动作，两人急忙闪到一边。面色阴沉的碇司令快步走了过去。

The large bruise colouring his cheek didn't go unnoticed by either of them.  
"他脸上的大块淤青，两人都看在眼里。

"Sir! Are... are you okay?" said Misato, overcoming her shock.  
"长官！您...您还好吗？" 碇真嗣克服了震惊，问道。

Commander Ikari spared them the briefest of glances before continuing on.  
碇司令只是匆匆瞥了他们一眼，便继续前行。

"Dr. Akagi will brief you. Carry on."  
"赤木博士会向你们简报。继续执行任务。"

And then he was gone. They both stared after him before silently entering the lift. Asuka hesitated only for a second before joining Misato. For the first time since they had left the apartment, she began to worry.  
然后他就消失了。两人目送他离去后，默默地走进了电梯。明日香犹豫了一秒，便加入了美里。这是他们离开公寓以来，她第一次开始感到担忧。

_First the secrecy and now the Commander looks as if he's been in a brawl.  
先是保密，现在指挥官看起来像是刚打过架似的。_

Misato spent the ride staring at the ceiling. Her thoughts clearly elsewhere and deftly avoiding Asuka's attempts to catch her eye as she tried to glean _any_ information on what they just saw and what she was walking into.  
美里在电梯里一直盯着天花板。她的思绪显然飘到了别处，巧妙地避开了明日香试图捕捉她目光的尝试，因为明日香正试图从她那里探知刚才所见以及自己即将步入的情况。

They exited into another corridor and Asuka noted the presence of Section 2 agents spaced periodically along the hallway. _Increased security?_  
他们走进另一条走廊，明日香注意到每隔一段距离就有第二分部的特工驻守。是加强了安保吗？

Before she could think about the implications of this, Misato stopped her at a door to one of the hospital's rooms. Nothing about the door in front of them marked it differently to any others. Misato turned to her, a reassuring smile on her face and allowing her to go in first.  
在她来得及思考这背后的含义之前，美里在医院的一间病房门前停下了脚步。这扇门与其他的并无二致。美里转向她，脸上带着安慰的微笑，示意她先进去。

_Fine, let's get this over with._ She took a breath and made to open the door. But then she paused, hand outstretched as she caught snippets of words from the other side.  
好吧，速战速决。她深吸一口气，准备开门。但就在这时，她停住了，手悬在半空，因为她听到了门另一侧传来的只言片语。

"_...can't help... if you don't..."_  
"...帮不上忙...如果你不..."

Dr. Akagi. She was talking to _someone._  
赤木博士。她在和某人说话。

Misato must've noticed her hesitation as she started to speak.  
看来碇真嗣注意到了她的犹豫，于是开始说话。

"I'll come inside with you, but it's just... well," Misato said. "It's best you see for yourself. As far as we know, she's completely... normal."  
"我跟你一起进去，但是...嗯，" 葛城说，"最好你自己看。据我们所知，她完全...正常。"

_She?_ _Normal? 她？正常？  
_

Before Asuka could go through the door, she was interrupted by another voice, this time, from the far end of the hallway.  
在明日香还没来得及进门之前，她被另一个声音打断了，这次是从走廊的另一头传来的。

"...telling you, I'm not the 'Second Child,' I'm an _only_ child! And just where the hell-"  
"...告诉你，我不是什么'第二孩子'，我是独生子！还有，这到底是怎么回事——"

Something about it was eerily _familiar_ but the thought quickly disappeared upon hearing the next speaker.  
这件事有种诡异的熟悉感，但这个念头很快就在听到下一个人的声音时消失了。

"Now, now Asuka, I'm sure Dr. Akagi will be able to-"  
"好了，好了，明日香，我相信赤木博士一定能——"

_Kaji!_

Both herself and Misato turned to see Kaji come around corner and Asuka's heart leapt into her throat as relief began to fill her. _I'm saved!_ Kaji would be able to deal with whatever _this_ was and then she could go home. Thoughts of finally having a warm shower permeated at the back of her mind. She pushed aside the other voice she heard, it had been a long day after all and no doubt her tiredness was making her hear things.  
她和美里同时转头，看到卡吉从拐角处走来，明日香的内心顿时涌起一阵宽慰，心跳加速。得救了！卡吉一定能处理好这一切，然后她就可以回家了。脑海中不禁浮现出终于能洗个热水澡的念头。她忽略了另一个声音，毕竟这一天实在太漫长了，疲惫让她产生了幻听。

_Now, smile!_ Chin up and eyes forward, she waved at Kaji whilst not so subtly positioning herself in front of the older woman.  
现在，微笑吧！抬起下巴，目光向前，她向卡吉挥手，同时不那么隐晦地将自己置于那位年长女性之前。

"Kaji!" she said, taking a step forward, but immediately stopped when she realised he wasn't alone. Two burly Section 2 agents trailed behind him with someone else in between. Kaji came to a halt in front of them and silence filled the hallway between the two parties. He stared at them, confusion evident on his face before he wordlessly stepped aside to reveal the individual trailing behind him.  
“卡吉！”她喊道，向前迈了一步，但立刻停下，因为她意识到他并非独自一人。两名魁梧的第二部门特工紧随其后，中间还夹着一个人。卡吉在他们面前停下，两拨人之间的走廊陷入了沉默。他盯着他们，脸上的困惑显而易见，随后他默默地侧身，露出了跟在他身后的那个人。

Asuka tensed at the sight, not quite believing what she was seeing.  
明日香看到这一幕时紧张起来，几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。

_A mirror?_ Was her first thought - _No._  
一面镜子？这是她的第一反应——不。

It was a girl. With a face and brilliant red hair identical to her own. At least, it seemed identical. Even the school uniform she wore was the same. Asuka watched the other girl examine her in return, mouth open in surprise. Something deep inside her recoiled at the sight of what appeared to be an exact copy of herself. She blinked the errant thought away.  
那是一个女孩。有着和她一模一样的面容和鲜艳的红发。至少，看起来是如此。就连她穿的校服也是一样的。明日香看着另一个女孩同样惊讶地审视着自己，嘴巴张得大大的。看到这个似乎是自己完美复制品的景象，她内心深处感到一阵抗拒。她眨了眨眼，将这个荒谬的想法抛诸脑后。

As if on cue, the two pointed accusingly at each other.  
仿佛按下了开关，两人同时互相指责起来。

_"_Who are _you?!"_ they said.  
“你是谁？！”他们异口同声地说。

The shock that had flooded Asuka was now giving away to anger as her mind tried to rationalise the sight in front of her. _A lookalike? A cheap wig?_ Anything to explain what she was seeing_._ She turned to Misato who looked equally opened her mouth to speak, to ask all the questions that were racing through her but the other girl beat her to it.  
原本充斥着明日香的震惊正逐渐转为愤怒，她的思绪试图合理化眼前所见：一个长相相似的人？一顶廉价的假发？任何能解释她所见之物的理由。她转向美里，后者同样张口欲言，想要问出心中急速闪过的所有疑问，但另一个女孩抢先了一步。

"Miss Misato?! They've got you too?" The lookalike stepped forward to approach them before she was stopped by Misato's raised hand.  
"米里小姐？！他们也抓到你了？" 那位长相酷似的人向前走去，想要接近他们，却被米里举起的手阻止了。

"Identify yourself!" she barked, causing both girls to flinch. Asuka recognised _that_ voice, the one normally reserved for when Misato was commanding the Evas. The effect was not lost on the other girl as she withered under Misato's glare.  
"报上名来！" 她厉声喝道，让两个女孩都吓了一跳。明日香认出了那个声音，那是米里通常指挥 EVA 时才会用的声音。另一个女孩在米里的瞪视下也显得畏缩了。

"M-miss Misato, it's me, Asuka! Asuka Langley Soryu!" When this information didn't solicit a response, she continued. "From school!" she added, frustration creeping into her voice.  
"米、米里小姐，是我，明日香！明日香·兰格雷·索西尔！" 当这些信息没有引起反应时，她继续说道。"学校里的！" 她补充道，声音中透露出焦躁。

Misato took in the girl's words before responding in a measured tone. She gestured towards Asuka beside her.  
碇真嗣在听到女孩的话后，用一种审慎的语气回应。他向身旁的明日香示意。

"_This_ is Asuka Langley Soryu. I'll ask again, identify yourself. And how did you get here?"  
"这位是明日香·兰格雷。我再问一次，请表明你的身份。你是怎么来到这里的？"

"I can answer that," Kaji said, stepping forward. "She was spotted wandering in the centre of the city. Section-2 received a report of a girl matching the Second Child's description who, seemed lost- _ow!_" A swift _whack_ on the arm caused him to yelp in pain.  
"我可以回答这个问题，"加持良治走上前说，"她是在市中心游荡时被发现的。第二课接到报告，说有一个与第二适格者描述相符的女孩，看起来迷路了——哎哟！" 他手臂上突然挨了一记，痛得他叫出声来。

"I was _not_ lost!" "我没有迷路！"

"You were standing in front of a tourist's map of the city." Kaji said as he massaged the arm where the faker – _Yeah, 'faker' was right._ - had struck him  
"你站在城市旅游地图前。" 卡吉边说边按摩着那个冒牌货——没错，就是'冒牌货'——打他的手臂

"I was simply confirming what I already knew," she crossed her arms, as if daring anyone to contradict her further. _Mein gott_, _she's annoying._ Asuka felt a pang of sympathy for the man. He made a face before continuing on with his explanation.  
"我只是在确认我已经知道的信息，" 她交叉双臂，仿佛在挑衅任何人进一步反驳。天哪，她真烦人。明日香对这个男人产生了一丝同情。他做了个鬼脸，然后继续解释。

"I happened to be nearby, so I got to her first."  
"我碰巧就在附近，所以先找到了她。"

"_Kidnapped_ is what you did! Unless picking up teenage girls is normal for you? Answer that!" Kaji ignored her.  
"你这是绑架！难道对你们来说，随便带走少女是家常便饭？回答我！"" 加持无视了她。

"Of course, I grew worried when she didn't seem to know where she was. Or even who _I_ was. So, I decided we should give the good doctor a visit-"  
"当然，当她似乎不知道自己在哪里，甚至不知道自己是谁时，我开始担心了。所以，我决定我们应该去拜访一下那位好医生——"

"Why didn't you call me?" Misato cut in. She had remained stone-faced throughout the display and now directed her ire at Kaji. He held his hands up defensively.  
"为什么你不给我打电话？" 惣流突然插话。她全程面无表情，此刻将怒火转向加持。他举起双手，做出防御的姿态。

"I did. Your line was engaged," he said and before Misato could speak further, "_and_ I called the apartment but Shinji told me you were already on your way here. Coming here seemed like the right call, huh Katsuragi?" Asuka noticed the other girl perk up at the mention of the boy's name.  
"我打了。你的电话占线，" 他说，没等惣流继续，"我又打到公寓，但真嗣告诉我你已经在来这里的路上了。来这里似乎是正确的选择，对吧，葛城？" 明日香注意到另一个女孩在提到男孩的名字时精神一振。

_Now how does she know that idiot?  
她是怎么认识那个笨蛋的？_

Misato huffed, accepting Kaji's words, if not the sly wink, directed at her. Then she turned her attention back to the girl. The girl claiming to be _her_.  
碇真嗣叹了口气，接受了加持的话，尽管对他那狡黠的眨眼不以为然。随后，她将注意力转回到那个女孩身上。那个自称是她的女孩。

"I was on the phone with Ritsuko, she asked me to come. Not because of her but someone else." Misato said thoughtfully before speaking to the lookalike again, "How do you know who I am?"  
“我刚才在和律子通电话，她让我过来。不是因为她，而是因为另一个人。”碇真嗣若有所思地说，然后再次向那个酷似自己的女孩发问，“你怎么知道我是谁？”

The girl looked dumbfounded for a second before taking a deep breath that Asuka instantly recognised as someone gathering their patience before speaking. When she did speak, it was slowly, as if to a child.  
那女孩愣了一下，随后深吸一口气，明日香立刻认出这是某人在耐心说话前聚集情绪的动作。当她开口时，语速缓慢，仿佛在对一个孩子说话。

"Because. You're. My. Teacher. In. School!" she paused at the looks they gave her "...What?"  
"因为。你。是。我。学校。的。老师！" 她停顿了一下，注意到他们投来的目光，"...怎么了？"

_Not only is she a damn dirty faker, she's crazy too._ Asuka had heard enough and made a move towards the door, as Misato motioned them all to go inside. The Section 2 agents cajoled the other girl who complied unhappily.  
她不仅是个卑鄙的骗子，还疯疯癫癫的。明日香已经听够了，正要朝门口走去，这时美里示意大家进屋。第二课的特工们哄着另一个女孩，她不情愿地答应了。

"Serves you right, trying to impersonate an Eva pilot." Asuka said, not quite whispering. She only partially heard the response.  
"活该，想冒充 EVA 驾驶员。" 明日香说道，声音不大不小。她只听到了部分回应。

"Least I'm not wearing a cheap wig." Asuka whirled around at the words, red faced.  
"至少我没戴廉价的假发。" 听到这话，明日香猛地转过身来，满脸通红。

"What did you say?!" "你说什么?!"

"I _said_, you're nothing but cheap copy and once I get out of here I'll-" Smugness radiated off the girl. Asuka's fists clenched in response and she shook with barely contained anger as she imagined pummelling her into dust. _If only Kaji wasn't here..._ She decided on some choice words of her own, voice rising.  
"我说，你不过是廉价的复制品，等我离开这里后，我会——" 女孩的得意之情溢于言表。明日香的拳头紧握，她因极力克制愤怒而颤抖，脑海中想象着将对方打成尘埃。如果加持先生不在这里就好了... 她决定也回敬几句，声音提高。

"I don't know what your game is but I'll-"  
"我不知道你在玩什么把戏，但我会——"

"That's enough!" "够了！"

They all turned to see a very annoyed Dr. Akagi standing in the now open doorway. She glanced at the assembled group, raising an eyebrow as she looked over the two identical girls. With a quick nod, she turned to go back inside the room and motioned the others to follow.  
他们全都转头看去，只见一脸不悦的赤木博士站在已经打开的门口。她扫视了一圈聚集的人群，当目光落在两个一模一样的女孩身上时，她挑了挑眉。随即，她快速地点了点头，转身回到房间内，示意其他人跟上。

"Misato, Kaji, you'll need to see this. And you too, Asuka," she said, catching herself as she looked back at them. "..._Both_ of you."  
"Misato, Kaji,你们得来看看这个。还有你，Asuka," 她说着，回头看向他们时及时纠正了自己的话。"...你们两个。"

Asuka didn't like how casually the doctor accepted the seemingly impossible. _Is no one else seeing how crazy this is? Am I the only sane one here?_ She grudgingly walked into the room, with the others – including the imposter – behind her.  
Asuka 不喜欢医生如此轻易地接受这看似不可能的事情。难道没有其他人觉得这很疯狂吗？我是这里唯一清醒的人吗？她不情愿地走进房间，其他人——包括那个冒牌货——跟在她后面。

It was a hospital room. Just like any other; spartan in design, large window, incredibly uncomfortable bed, _See? Nothing scary-_  
这是一间病房。和其他病房没什么两样；设计简朴，有一扇大窗户，还有一张极其不舒服的床，看吧？没什么可怕的-

She froze. On the bed was _another_ girl who looked just like her. Well, _almost._ One eye was covered by an eyepatch. The sight proved too much for Asuka. The _real_ Asuka. She mentally reminded herself of such a thing before a shrill screech escaped her mouth.  
她僵住了。床上躺着另一个与她长得一模一样的女孩。嗯，几乎一模一样。一只眼睛被眼罩遮住。这景象对真正的明日香来说太过震撼。她在心里提醒自己这一点，随后一声尖锐的尖叫从她口中逃逸而出。

"_Ehhhhh?!_" 诶诶诶？！

Misato and Kaji ducked their heads in as they followed the _other_ Asuka. Even they couldn't stifle their gasps. Already having overcome shock once before, Asuka was quick to recover and this time let out that annoying pit of frustration that had been growing all evening.  
美里和加持跟着另一个明日香探头进来，连他们也忍不住倒吸一口凉气。已经经历过一次震惊的明日香迅速恢复过来，这次她释放了整个晚上积累起来的那股恼人的挫败感。

"What the hell is going on here!?" She directed the question to Dr. Akagi, who seemed nonplussed at the outburst. "Was there a secret meeting of 14-year-old redheads I wasn't told about!? Do you want to explain this!?" One arm was waving angrily in the direction of the bed bound girl. She stomped towards the edge of the bed to get a closer look.  
"这到底是怎么回事！？" 她将问题抛向了阿卡吉博士，后者对这场爆发似乎无动于衷。"难道有一个我没被告知的 14 岁红发少女秘密会议吗！？你不想解释一下吗！？" 她的一只手臂愤怒地指向床上躺着的女孩。她跺着脚走向床边，想要更近距离地观察。

_"_Don't tell me, your name just so happens to be _Asuka Langley Soryu_ too, right?" She couldn't help but sneer.  
"别告诉我，你的名字恰好也是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，对吧？" 她忍不住嗤笑道。

This one remained silent, staring at her. Asuka caught the briefest flicker as the girl on the bed looked over to the _other_ copy. She rolled her eyes when no answers were forthcoming and turned back to Dr. Akagi, intent on resuming her rant.  
这个女孩保持沉默，盯着她看。明日香捕捉到床上的女孩向另一个复制体瞥了一眼的短暂闪烁。当没有得到回答时，她翻了个白眼，转回身面向阿卡吉博士，准备继续她的怒斥。

"Tell me doc, what was it? A secret experiment? Expert mimes? Cloning? Ripped open a hole in the space-time conti-"  
"告诉我，医生，那是什么？秘密实验？专业哑剧演员？克隆？撕开了时空连续体的洞？"

"Shikinami._"_ "式波。"

Asuka paused at the words from bed-faker, not quite sure she heard her right. She whipped back around to face her. _Shiki-what?_ The whole room was now looking at her and Asuka took the moment's pause to take in more apparent differences between them. _Her hair's different to mine... not quite as red._  
听到床上那个假扮者的话，明日香愣了一下，不太确定自己是否听错了。她猛地转过身来面对她。式波是什么？整个房间的人现在都看着她，明日香趁这个停顿的时刻，更加明显地观察她们之间的差异。她的头发和我的不一样...没有那么红。

"It's _Shikinami_. Asuka Shikinami Langley." A quiet chuckle escaped her and she directed her next statement to Misato. "And I don't believe I was ever _that_ much of a brat." She smirked at Asuka, who scowled in return. She hadn't failed to notice that the girl had been handcuffed to the bed either.  
"我是式波。式波·明日香·兰格雷。" 她轻声笑了出来，接着对美里说道："而且我不认为我曾经那么任性。" 她对明日香挑了挑眉，后者则回以怒视。她也没有忽略掉女孩被手铐铐在床上的事实。

"So, you _can_ speak." said Dr. Akagi.  
"看来，你会说话。" 赤木博士说道。

The girl shrugged in response.  
女孩耸了耸肩作为回应。

"And the incident before? You understand why we had to restrain you?"  
"那之前的事件呢？你明白我们为何不得不限制你吗？"

Another shrug, "I... mistook him for someone else. I was just... surprised."  
又是耸肩，“我……误把他当作了别人。我只是……感到惊讶。”

"Dr. Akagi tells me you were found unconscious near one of the entrances to the Geofront," Misato said, "where are you from? And why do you have a plugsuit?"  
"赤木博士告诉我，你在 Geofront 其中一个入口附近被发现时处于昏迷状态，" 葛城说，"你来自哪里？为什么你穿着插入栓服？"

"I don't know how I got here exactly, and plugsuit? Isn't it obvious? I'm an Eva pilot, of course." The girl's tone was calm, almost nonchalant. The _other_ girl, rushed forward to the foot of the bed beside Asuka.  
"我不太清楚自己是怎么来到这里的，至于插入栓服？这不是很明显吗？我是一名 Eva 驾驶员，当然要穿这个。" 女孩的语气平静，几乎有些漫不经心。另一个女孩急忙跑到床边，站在明日香旁边。

"So, you're not from here either?" She said. Asuka couldn't help but blanch at the almost pleading tone she put on. G_reat. You found a friend, and she's as much of an imposter as you. Now get lost._  
"那么，你也不是这里的人吗？" 她说道。明日香不禁脸色一白，对方那几乎带着恳求的语气让她感到不妙。太好了。你找到了一个朋友，结果她和你一样是个冒牌货。现在给我消失吧。

"Seems we're both visitors to this place," Shikinami gave a curt nod to the other Soryu before turning to look outside.  
"看来我们都是这个地方的访客，" 式波对另一个惣流简短地点了点头，然后转头望向窗外。

"So, doctor, what's the diagnosis?" said Kaji.  
"那么，医生，诊断结果是什么？" 加治问道。

Ritsuko looked over the new arrivals. With them all now in the room at once, the normally oversized space was feeling much more crowded and she leant against the window frame as spoke.  
律子扫视着新来的人。当他们全部同时出现在房间里时，这个平时显得过大的空间顿时感觉拥挤了许多，她便倚着窗框开始说话。

"Well, I've already run a blood test on Miss '_Shikinami'_ here_,_ she's not a clone of our Asuka. In fact, there's a slight difference in her DNA. She may look almost identical but she isn't _our_ Asuka," she turned to the other _non-Asuka_, "I will need a blood sample from you as well. For both your and our safety, you understand." It wasn't a request.  
"嗯，我已经对这位'式波'小姐进行了血液检测，她并非我们明日香的克隆体。实际上，她的 DNA 存在微小差异。虽然她看起来几乎一模一样，但她并不是我们的明日香。" 她转向另一位非明日香，"我也需要从你这里获取一份血样。为了你和我们的安全，你明白的。" 这不是请求。

The Asuka that had arrived with Kaji had been slowly inching away from the group towards the door, before she was addressed.  
与加持一同到来的明日香，正悄悄地从人群中挪向门口，直到有人叫住了她。

"Do I have to? Look, I just want to go home, I won't tell anyone-" There it was, the lost girl routine again. Misato approached her and knelt down towards the girl and putting on a smile for her.  
“我非得这样吗？我只是想回家，我不会告诉任何人的——”看，那套无助少女的把戏又来了。美里走向她，蹲下身，对着女孩露出一个安慰的微笑。

"Hey, there's no need to worry. Dr. Akagi will make sure you're all right and then we'll figure out a way to get you home. Is that okay?"  
“嘿，不用担心。赤木博士会确保你没事的，然后我们会想办法送你回家。这样行吗？”

_Oh look, Mommy-Misato has made an appearance._ _It's just an act,_ that angry little voice within Asuka thought, surprising herself with how bitter she sounded. To add to her ire, Kaji decided to join in.  
哦，看哪，妈妈咪-美里出现了。这只是演戏，明日香内心那个愤怒的小声音想道，她对自己听起来如此苦涩感到惊讶。更让她恼火的是，加持也决定加入进来。

"And I'm sure Asuka, ahem, _our_ Asuka will be happy to keep you company. Am I right?" he said. He looked over to her and gave her _that_ smile. The one that caused all sorts of funny feelings in her stomach, and in this case, kept her from objecting. Feeling a slight warmth in her cheeks, Asuka nodded, deciding to not cause a fuss. _Only because I want to get this over with,_ she thought.  
“我相信明日香，嗯，我们的明日香会很乐意陪伴你的。我说得对吗？”他说道。他看向她，给了她那个微笑。那个让她的胃里产生各种奇妙感觉的微笑，在这种情况下，让她无法提出异议。感觉到脸颊微微发热，明日香点了点头，决定不制造麻烦。只是因为我想快点结束这一切，她想。

She watched the other girl quietly accept Dr. Akagi's request; now apparently reassured. The implication of what _she_ had agreed to suddenly hit her. _Wait... does that mean I can't go home?_  
她静静地看着另一个女孩接受了赤木博士的请求；现在显然放心了。她突然意识到自己所同意的事情的含义。等等...那是不是意味着我不能回家了？

_"_Good, we'll have both of you set up in rooms nearby." Dr. Akagi said as Asuka rounded on her.  
"好的，我们会安排你们俩住在附近的房间。" 赤木博士说道，此时明日香正朝她转过身来。

"What? Why me?!" "什么？为什么是我？！"

As if expecting this response, she clasped her hands with a smile that seemed almost predatory.  
仿佛预料到了这个反应，她双手合十，露出了一个几乎带有掠食者气息的微笑。

"You're our control sample, of course. I would hope with your education, Asuka, you would understand the need for a _proper_ scientific evaluation."  
"你当然是我们的对照样本。我希望以你的学识，明日香，你能理解进行科学评估的必要性。"

_But I want to go home!  
但我想要回家！_

She didn't like it but she knew Dr. Akagi was right. And faced with all three adults waiting for an answer plus, these two _imitations_ all looking expectantly at her, she wasn't going to chicken out now.  
她虽然不喜欢这样，但知道赤木博士说得对。面对三位大人的等待，再加上这两个仿制品都满怀期待地看着她，她现在可不能退缩。

"Fine._"_ "好的。"

"I'll have extra security assigned to both of them. This is still a secure facility and we can't take chances are far as the Evas are concerned." Misato said. Ritsuko gave her an empty smile.  
"我会为两人增派额外的安保。这里仍然是安全设施，关于 Eva，我们不能冒险。" 美里说道。律子对她露出了一个空洞的微笑。

"The Commander shares your concerns. He's tasked Rei with overwatch duty," she jerked a thumb over her shoulder to the window outside. "In her Eva."  
"指挥官和你有同样的担忧。他已经指派绫波负责监视任务，" 她用拇指向后指了指窗外的方向。"在她的 Eva 里。"

They all turned to stare out the window. In the far distance, towering above the trees, was the unmistakeable sight of Unit-00, In her hands was a massive sniper rifle propped up against a makeshift barricade.  
他们全都转头望向窗外。在远处的树梢之上，矗立着 Unit-00 那不容错认的身影，她手中握着一把巨大的狙击步枪，倚靠在一处临时搭建的掩体上。

It was aiming directly at the room.  
它的枪口正直指这个房间。

The silence that followed told the doctor all she needed as to what they thought of that. Asuka still couldn't believe what she had gotten herself into.  
随后的沉默已经告诉了医生他们对此的看法。明日香仍然无法相信自己卷入了这样的局面。

_I always thought the Commander was a little odd but this is...  
我一直觉得指挥官有点古怪，但这次……_

Behind all of them, unsure why they had all gone slightly pale, the other Soryu raised a hand.  
在他们身后，不明白为什么大家都脸色微白，另一艘苍龙举起了手。

"Er... what's an Eva?"  
“呃……Eva 是什么？”

---

It was the end of another school day as Shinji made his way home, grocery bags in hand and thankful for the slight breeze around him. It had been five days since Misato had whisked Asuka away to Nerv HQ and if the call this morning was to be believed, they would be returning home tonight.  
又是一天学业的结束，真嗣提着购物袋走在回家的路上，庆幸身边有一丝微风。自从五天前美里带着明日香匆匆前往 NERV 总部后，今天早上电话里说，她们今晚就会回来。

Details as to what the two had been up to had been scarce, only that Asuka was required for some extra tests.  
至于两人具体在忙些什么，信息寥寥无几，只知道明日香需要进行一些额外的测试。

_They even cancelled this week's sync tests. Maybe I'll find out more when they come home.  
他们甚至取消了本周的同步测试。或许等她们回来，我能了解更多。_

He had _tried_ to ask Misato more questions. Worried as to what could have taken his roommate and fellow pilot away. Misato had been evasive, reassuring him it was nothing dangerous and that it may be best if he made a special welcome home dinner for her, as well as two extra guests.  
他曾试图向美里询问更多问题，担心是什么事情让他的室友兼同事离开了。美里含糊其辞，安慰他说这不是什么危险的事，并建议他最好为她的归来准备一顿特别的欢迎晚餐，还有两位额外的客人。

Again, Misato had been vague as to who they were or why they were coming to dinner. She had only told him that whatever Asuka would like, her guests most likely would too. This didn't sit right with Shinji, but he decided to trust in Misato's faith in him.  
再次，美里对于来客的身份和来访原因含糊其辞。她只告诉他，只要是明日香喜欢的，她的客人们多半也会喜欢。这让真嗣感到不安，但他还是决定相信美里对他的信任。

_I suppose I can be grateful she's not insisting on cooking herself._ In the end, he had decided on steak. It was simple enough to be made in the time that he had but something he was sure Asuka would be fond of, especially compared to the normal food she ate in the Katsuragi household. He realised that the peace and tranquillity of the past week that he had enjoyed on his own would be broken.  
我想我应该庆幸她没有坚持要自己下厨。最终，他决定做牛排。这足够简单，能在他有限的时间内完成，而且他确信明日香会喜欢，尤其是与葛城家的日常饮食相比。他意识到，过去一周独自享受的宁静与平和将被打破。

Still, his roommates would be back. _I hope they enjoy the food._  
尽管如此，他的室友们还是会回来的。希望他们喜欢这些食物。

"Ikari?" 碇？

He was jolted out of his reverie to find he had arrived at the apartment block with Rei was standing next the entrance.  
他被惊醒，发现自己已经到达了公寓楼，而绫波正站在入口旁。

_Was she waiting for me?  
她是在等我吗？_

He shifted a bag to the other hand and raised it in an awkward wave.  
他将包换到另一只手上，尴尬地挥了挥手。

"Oh, uh, hi Ayanami, have you been waiting long?" She was wearing her usual school uniform though she had not attended today or even the past week. He had wondered whether the timing with Asuka's absence was a coincidence but as he didn't have contact with either party, could not confirm. Would Rei even tell him?  
"哦，呃，嗨，绫波，你等很久了吗？" 她穿着平时的校服，尽管今天甚至过去一周她都没来学校。他曾怀疑明日香缺席的时机是否巧合，但由于他与双方都没有联系，无法确认。绫波会告诉他吗？

She looked at him, gazing down at the shopping bags in hand but making no move to offer any help.  
她看着他，目光落在手中的购物袋上，却丝毫没有帮忙的意思。

"The Second Child is to return to your apartment today."  
第二适格者今天将返回你的公寓。

He blinked, not expecting anything to hear about Asuka's mysterious absence from the girl.  
他眨了眨眼，没想到会从女孩那里听到关于明日香神秘缺席的消息。

"Ah, yeah. Misato told me this morning. Were you taking part in those tests too?"  
"啊，对。美里今早告诉我了。你也参加了那些测试吗？"

"No."

_Oh._ That killed whatever conversation he may have tried to get answers out of the stoic girl. _I guess I'll find out in a little while in any case_. He shifted awkwardly as they both stood there and decided he should invite her in. Plus his arms were starting to ache. Before he could offer, she started walking away.  
哦。这让他原本可能试图从那位沉默寡言的女孩那里套出答案的对话戛然而止。我想无论如何我很快就会知道了。他尴尬地挪动了一下，两人就这样站着，他觉得应该邀请她进来。而且他的手臂也开始酸痛了。还没等他开口，她已经开始走开了。

She stopped just before passing him.  
她在经过他之前停了下来。

"Good luck, Ikari." And then she was gone, leaving a confused Shinji in her wake.  
"祝你好运，碇君。" 随后她便消失了，留下一头雾水的真嗣在原地。

_What did she mean by that?  
她那话是什么意思？_

**Author notes: 作者注：**

So this was originally inspired by a picture posted on the Asushin subreddit of two Asuka's staring wearily at each other with poor Shinji off the side. It's my take on finding a resolution to the Shikinami/Shinji relationship at the end of 3.0 and most of the ideas in this story were from before I saw the final Rebuild film.  
这个故事最初灵感来源于 Asushin 子版块上的一张图片，两位明日香疲惫地对视着，而可怜的真嗣则被晾在一旁。这是我对于 3.0 结尾处真希波/真嗣关系的解决方式的设想，故事中的大部分想法在我观看最终的 Rebuild 电影之前就已经形成。

I was mostly happy with how it resolved and I know character's crossing over is not a new idea but still wanted to put my spin on it. Plus I've got a third Asuka in there too. For anyone who doesn't know, she's from the Ep. 26 AU and I wanted her in this because she provides such a nice contrast to the other two who've only known Eva piloting all their lives.  
我对这个结局大体上感到满意，我知道角色交叉并不是什么新概念，但还是想加入自己的解读。此外，我还加入了第三个明日香。对于不了解的人来说，她来自第 26 集的平行宇宙，我想让她出现在这里，因为她与其他两位一生都在驾驶 EVA 的明日香形成了很好的对比。

Massive thank you to SheriffJohnStone for pre-reading, some very helpful edits and great advice around keeping things a little clearer than they originally were. Who knew things could get confusing with three characters sharing the same first name and looks? The next chapter I'll have them officially be given names that all characters can refer to them by and should makes things easier to follow.  
非常感谢 SheriffJohnStone 提前阅读、提供一些非常有帮助的编辑和保持情节清晰的好建议。谁能想到，当三个角色共享同一个名字和外貌时，事情会变得如此混乱呢？下一章我将正式给他们起名字，所有角色都可以这样称呼他们，这样应该更容易理解。

I think it'll be a fun character study if nothing else.  
我觉得即便别无其他，这也会是一次有趣的角色研究。

Thoughts and constructive criticism welcome as always and thanks for reading.  
一如既往地欢迎大家的想法和建设性批评，感谢阅读。

## Chapter 2: Charmed 第二章：被施了魔法的**

---

_Subjects 'Shikinami' and 'Soryu' are both unable to recall exactly how they travelled to our world. As of yet nothing conclusive to report. What is clear is that neither girl is compatible with our Eva cores based on the limited and restricted tests we have run.  
对象'式波'和'惣流'均无法准确回忆起她们是如何来到我们世界的。截至目前，尚无定论报告。可以确定的是，根据我们有限且受限的测试，这两个女孩与我们的 Eva 核心均不兼容。_

_Subject Shikinami has shared some information about her role as a pilot, though her account differs wildly in a number of places compared to events we have experienced - see section 2.0 of this report for details. No abnormalities detected.  
对象式波分享了她作为驾驶员的一些信息，尽管她的叙述与我们经历的事件在许多地方存在巨大差异——详见本报告第 2.0 节。未检测到异常。_

_Subject Soryu, identical in appearance to the Second Child, is a civilian middle school student with no knowledge of Nerv or Evas. Her initial apprehension at her new surroundings have faded. Subject shares a similar temperament to the Second Child. No abnormalities detected.  
对象 Soryu，外貌与第二适格者完全相同，是一名对 Nerv 或 Eva 一无所知的普通中学生。她对新环境的初步戒备已消退。对象与第二适格者性格相似。未检测到异常。_

_Recommendation: Release into care of appropriate personnel with level 1 security measures.  
建议：交由适当人员照看，实施一级安全措施。_

_Signed: Dr R. Akagi 签名：赤木博士 R._

It had been five days since the two mysterious girls had appeared in Tokyo-3.  
自那两位神秘少女出现在第三新东京市以来，已经过去了五天。

Endless rounds of tests had ensued; blood tests, psychological tests, evaluations by a number of medical professionals and even a low level sync test were employed to find out as much as possible about the Asuka's apparent twins.  
随之而来的是无休止的测试：血液检测、心理测试、众多医疗专家的评估，甚至包括低级别的同步测试，旨在尽可能多地了解明日香这对看似双胞胎的情况。

The results of all of this were now on the desk in front of them.  
这一切的结果现在都摆在他们面前的桌子上。

Misato stood alongside Ritsuko and Kaji in the Commander's office, fighting with the nagging feeling that she was forgetting something.  
碇司令的办公室里，葛城美里与律子、加持并肩站立，努力对抗着那种似乎忘记了什么重要事情的烦人感觉。

Something _important_. 非常重要的事情。

However, her attention soon shifted to the Commander who sat in front of them.  
然而，她的注意力很快转移到了坐在他们前面的指挥官身上。

_Will he see it our way?_ She would be lying if she said she wasn't at least a little bit nervous. Ritsuko, Kaji and herself had each spent time questioning the two new girls looking for inconsistencies in their testimonies or flaws in the testing.  
他会认同我们的看法吗？如果她说自己一点也不紧张，那肯定是在撒谎。律子、加持和她自己都分别花时间审问了那两个新来的女孩，寻找她们证词中的矛盾之处或测试中的缺陷。

They reached the same conclusion - Asuka's doppelgängers posed no threat to Nerv or its operations. Priority would be to return both to their original worlds. How and when this would happen was a little sketchy. _I'll leave Ritsuko to figure that one out._  
他们得出了相同的结论——明日香的这两个分身对 NERV 或其行动不构成威胁。首要任务是将她们送回各自原本的世界。至于如何以及何时执行，还有些模糊。这件事就留给律子去解决吧。

Misato watched every movement of the Commander's gloved hands as they turned the pages of the hefty report. Some parts were skipped or spared just a glance whereas others were read in more detail. He hadn't said a word the entire time nor had he made any visible sign that something was out of the ordinary, as if it were just another routine meeting of the senior staff.  
美里注视着指挥官戴着皮手套的双手，它们翻阅着厚重的报告。有些部分被跳过或只是匆匆一瞥，而其他部分则被更详细地阅读。他全程未发一言，也没有表现出任何异常的迹象，仿佛这只是高级职员例行会议的一部分。

All normal. 一切正常。

The bruise colouring his cheek, no longer swollen as it had been days earlier, flew in the face of that assessment. Misato took it as a point of pride that she had stopped herself from mentioning it.  
他脸颊上的淤青，已不像几天前那样肿胀，与这种判断相悖。美里以此为傲，她克制住了自己没有提及这一点。

_And Shinji says I have no tact.  
真嗣还说我没有分寸。_

She was quietly grateful that neither Ritsuko nor Kaji had brought it up either-  
她暗自庆幸，律子和加持也没有提起这件事——

"I'm glad to see you are recovering, Commander."  
“很高兴看到您正在康复，指挥官。”

Misato turned to stare in disbelief at Kaji. _You jackass…_  
碇真嗣转过头，难以置信地盯着加持。你这个混蛋…

The commander didn't respond immediately. A moment passed. When he finally did speak, Gendo kept his eyes on the pages in front of him as he addressed the ponytailed man.  
指挥官没有立即回应。片刻之后，当他终于开口时，碇源堂依旧盯着面前的文件，对那位马尾男子说道。

"Your concern is noted, Mr. Kaji."  
“你的担忧已经记录在案，加持先生。”

Despite the darkness around them, she could've sworn light glinted off the commander's glasses. _How does he do that?_ She wondered, an involuntary shiver running up her spine.  
尽管四周一片漆黑，她发誓指挥官的眼镜上闪过一丝光芒。他是怎么做到的？她心中疑惑，不由自主地打了个寒颤。

Nothing further was said and the silence resumed.  
没有再多说什么，沉默再次降临。

Misato let out a breath and glanced at the others. Ritsuko twitched in amusement but managed to keep a straight face. Kaji, with no shame whatsoever, winked at both of them. _Ugh, I'll kill him later._  
葛城美里深吸一口气，瞥了其他人一眼。律子忍不住抽动了一下，却还是保持了严肃的表情。而加持则毫无顾忌地向她们眨了眨眼。呃，晚点再收拾他。

The Commander continued reading for several more pages before putting the document aside, next to Kaji's half read report on the Soryu girl. The evaluation of the _original_ Asuka lay untouched - Ritsuko's report. And it was she who was addressed first by the Commander.  
指挥官又翻阅了几页，才将文件搁置一旁，旁边是卡吉未读完的关于 Soryu 女孩的报告。关于原版明日香的评估报告——律子的报告——仍未被触碰。而指挥官首先向律子发问。

"'Shikinami' and 'Soryu'?" Gendo asked.  
“'式波'和'惣流'？”源渡问道。

"Shikinami is the name of the girl who... attacked you. Soryu is the name of the one Inspector Kaji brought in. We differentiated their names to avoid confusion."  
“式波是那个……袭击你的女孩的名字。惣流是卡吉检察官带来的那个女孩的名字。我们区分她们的名字以避免混淆。”

"I see," a hard stare swept over all three of them, "and you think it best to allow them to leave?" Misato knew the question was coming but tensed up nonetheless.  
"我明白了，"一道锐利的目光扫过他们三人，"你们认为最好让他们离开吗？"尽管知道这个问题会被提出，但葛城美里还是不由自主地紧张起来。

Thankfully, Ritsuko was ready with an answer.  
幸好，赤木律子已经准备好了回答。

"That's correct. They're no use to us as pilots. The limited connections we've made between them and the test bodies shows they would not even reach the level for sustained activation. By all metrics, Asuka is still the only one who can pilot Unit-02."  
"确实如此。他们作为驾驶员对我们毫无用处。我们与测试机体之间有限的联系表明，他们甚至无法达到持续激活的水平。从所有标准来看，明日香仍然是唯一能驾驶二号机的人。"

Subcommander Fuyutski, who had been quiet until now, chimed in.  
一直沉默至今的副司令冬月此时插话道。

"How reliable are the results from the simulation bodies considering the last Angel attack? And what of the plugsuit the Shikinami girl arrived in, that seems to imply she is a pilot."  
考虑到上次使徒攻击的情况，模拟体得出的结果可靠性如何？还有，那个名为式波的女孩所穿的插入栓服，似乎暗示着她是驾驶员。

"The Angel was purged from the testing chamber, no contamination has been detected in the past seven days since its destruction. As for Shikinami, the MAGI are still analysing the data but we believe she is simply incompatible with our Eva cores." Ritsuko said.  
"使徒已被从测试舱室清除，自其被摧毁后的七天内未检测到任何污染。至于式波，MAGI 仍在分析数据，但我们认为她与我们的 Eva 核心不相容。" 律子说道。

The answer seemed to satisfy the Subcommander and he gave a nod in acceptance.  
这个回答似乎让副指挥官感到满意，他点头表示接受。

Misato took her cue. 碇真嗣抓住了时机。

"And _I_ believe it's best that we allow them to return from wherever they came. We're not sure _how_ exactly. Both girls have complained about some memory loss," she felt the Commander's cold expression directed at her and she faltered for a moment.  
"并且相信最好让他们从哪里来就回哪里去。我们不确定具体如何操作。两个女孩都抱怨说有些记忆丧失，" 她感觉到指挥官冷冷的目光投向自己，一时语塞。

But her own hazy memories of a time she had spent alone and afraid hardened her resolve and she figured it was best to just go ahead and say it.  
但她自己对那段孤独恐惧时光的朦胧记忆坚定了她的决心，她认为最好还是直接说出来。

"Both of them seem to share the same circle of acquaintances as our Asuka. They seem to know me and her friends at school. Shinji too." She watched for a reaction.  
"他们俩似乎和我们的明日香有着共同的交际圈。他们似乎认识我和她在学校的那些朋友。真嗣也是。" 她观察着对方的反应。

Nothing. _So far, so good._ She continued, confidence building.  
没有任何反应。到目前为止，一切顺利。她继续说着，信心逐渐增强。

"It's my belief that allowing them to interact with those they are familiar with may help them in remembering and, eventually, returning to where they came from. I take full responsibility for their well-being and security!"  
"我相信让他们与熟悉的人互动可能有助于他们恢复记忆，并最终回到他们来的地方。我完全负责他们的福祉和安全！"

She felt herself standing just a little straighter.  
她感觉自己站得更直了一些。

_Come on, I'm already looking after your son. This can't be worse._ She wisely kept this to herself but her concern was genuine, especially for Soryu. _Having the girls locked up at Nerv isn't good for them. And the sooner they-_  
得了吧，我已经在照顾你的儿子了。这不会更糟。她明智地没有说出这些，但她对 Soryu 的担忧是真切的。把女孩们关在 Nerv 对她们不好。而且越早-

"You may proceed. Dismissed."  
"你可以继续。解散。"

Not quite believing her luck, Misato gave a smart salute before turning and walking towards the door. Ritsuko and Kaji fell in behind her. She had reached the door and was about to open it when the Commander's voice reached them across the vastness of the office space.  
难以置信自己的好运，碇真嗣给了个利落的敬礼，然后转身向门口走去。律子和加持紧随其后。她已经走到门口，正要开门时，指挥官的声音穿越办公室的广阔空间传到了他们耳中。

"Mr. Kaji." "加持先生。"

"Sir?" Kaji said, casually turning around.  
"先生？" 薰随意地转过身来。

"I believe a report on the Second Child's movements for the past 30 days will be necessary. I want it on my desk by tomorrow morning."  
"我认为关于第二适格者过去 30 天行动的报告是必要的。我希望明天早上之前放在我的桌上。"

Misato could see Kaji's eyes widen in surprise. To his credit he managed to keep his voice level when answering.  
碇真嗣可以看到薰的眼睛因惊讶而睁大。值得称赞的是，他在回答时设法保持了声音的平稳。

"Ah, of course Commander."  
"啊，当然，指挥官。"

All three left the office, relaxing considerably as they did so. She caught Kaji looking at her, no doubt fishing for sympathy but she was having none of it . She playfully stuck her tongue out at him, leaving him grumbling under his breath. Okay, _maybe_ a small part of her did feel sorry for him.  
三人一同离开了办公室，离开时明显放松了不少。她注意到卡吉正看着她，无疑是在寻求同情，但她对此毫不买账。她俏皮地向他吐了吐舌头，留下他在一旁低声抱怨。好吧，也许她内心深处确实对他有一点点同情。

Section 2 surveillance reports weren't exactly light reading.  
第二课的监视报告可不是什么轻松的读物。

But the man had brought it upon himself. _Hah, serves you right!_  
但这人自找的。哈，活该！

As they took the lift to the lower levels, Ritsuko turned to Kaji.  
当他们乘电梯前往下层时，律子转向了加持。

"So, you think little Miss Soryu is ready to go?" Ritsuko said, referring to the non-piloting Asuka. _That'll take some getting used to,_ she thought. Kaji perked up at the change in topic. He made a sweeping gesture around the muted confines of the lift.  
“那么，你觉得小索龙小姐准备好了吗？”律子说道，指的是非驾驶员的明日香。她想，这得花点时间适应。加持听到话题转变，精神一振。他在电梯沉闷的空间里做了一个大手势。

"Oh I think she is, I don't think she's going to miss this place. Or the food."  
"哦，我觉得她会的，我想她不会怀念这个地方。或者这里的食物。"

"Yeah, it's _the food_ she hates. Nothing to do with what happened the other day, right?" Misato cut in.  
"是啊，她讨厌的是食物。跟前几天发生的事无关，对吧？" 碇真嗣插话道。

---

_Kaji entered Soryu's room for yet another day of questions and scientific tests.  
加持再次进入绫波丽的房间，又是一天的问询和科学测试。_

"_Don't you know how to knock? What if I was getting dressed?!"_  
"你不知道敲门吗？万一我在换衣服怎么办？！"

"_You know we have cameras in here, don't you?" He pointed at the small device nestled in the corner of the room._  
""你知道这里有摄像头吧？"" 他指着房间角落里的小设备说道。

"_Whaaaaat?! You creep!"_ "什么？！你这个变态！"

_SMASH_

---

"Now, now Katsuragi, that was just a misunderstanding. She calmed down after that and hasn't thrown anything since-"  
"好了好了，葛城，那只是个误会。她后来平静下来了，之后也没再扔过东西——"

"That's because it was the only vase in the room," Ritsuko chirped up helpfully. Kaji pretended not to hear, putting his hands in his pockets and giving the two a wry smile.  
"那是因为房间里就那一个花瓶，" 律子热心地插话道。加持装作没听见，双手插兜，对两人露出一丝苦笑。

"I think I've gotten through to her."  
"我想我已经说服她了。"

Misato snortedand tried her best to ignore the sly look Ritsuko threw at her as she spoke again.  
葛城美里哼了一声，尽力忽视了律子在说话时投来的狡黠目光。

"It must be your charms."  
一定是你的魅力。

Kaji preened. Misato couldn't take his smug attitude any longer.  
加持自鸣得意。美里再也忍受不了他那自负的态度了。

"The only charms that girl needs are the sort used to ward off evil spirits!" She made a face at him as Ritsuko gave a chuckle. _Why do I put up with him?_ She could only shake her head in dismay.  
"那个女孩需要的唯一护身符，就是用来驱邪的那种！" 她对他做了个鬼脸，而律子则轻笑了一声。我为什么要忍受他？她只能无奈地摇了摇头。

"Though I'm sure Asuka would settle for an attack of the supernatural kind if it meant getting out of the hospital and into Unit-02. She's practically crawling up the walls," she paused as a thought came to her, "you know, I think she misses Shinji's cooking."  
"虽然我敢肯定，如果能让明日香离开医院，进入二号机，她宁愿遭受一次超自然攻击。她几乎要爬墙了，" 她停顿了一下，一个念头闪过，"你知道吗，我觉得她想念真嗣的厨艺了。

_Now if only she could actually say something nice to him._ The thought of the three of them back together again did put a smile on her face. _Plus two extras,_ she reminded herself.  
要是她能真的对他说些好话就好了。想到他们三个再次团聚，她的脸上不禁露出了微笑。再加上两个额外的，她提醒自己。

"I called Shinji this morning, he should have a nice dinner prepared. That should cheer her up. I'm sure Soryu and Shikinami would appreciate it too," she nudged Ritsuko, "right?"  
"我今早给真嗣打了电话，他应该准备了一顿丰盛的晚餐。那应该能让她开心起来。我相信索琉和式波也会喜欢的，" 她轻推了推律子，"对吧？"

Ritsuko looked up from the papers she was carrying.  
律子从手中的文件中抬起头来。

"Oh, yes. I'm sure Miss Soryu would be happy to leave. Shikinami though..." Ritsuko trailed off as if lost in thought.  
"哦，是的。我确信索琉小姐会很高兴离开。至于式波嘛……" 律子话音渐弱，似乎陷入了沉思。

"Shikinami? What about her?"  
"式波？她怎么了？"

"Well," Ritsuko started, removing her glasses and rubbing away at tired eyes, "I'm not sure exactly. I've read your and Kaji's reports but I still can't shake the feeling she's holding back."  
"嗯，" 律子开始说道，摘下眼镜揉了揉疲惫的双眼，"我不太确定。我读了你和加持的报告，但我总觉得她有所保留。"

Misato felt a pang of sympathy as she considered her friend's words. It had been a long week for all of them.  
听到朋友的话，美里感到一阵同情。对他们所有人来说，这周都异常漫长。

"She's kept her cards close to her chest," Kaji added.  
"她一直把牌紧贴胸口，" 加持补充道。

"Correct. You've seen how she is," said Ritsuko.  
"没错。你已经见识过她的作风了，" 律子说。

Misato and Kaji shared a glance, both knowing what she meant.  
美里和加持交换了一个眼神，两人都明白她的意思。

Shikinami was the quietest out of the three by far. And it wasn't down to timidness on her part. The Shikinami girl lacked the brash impulsiveness that came so easily to the Asuka Misato knew. The difference had been startling at first.  
三人之中，式波是最为沉默的一个。这并非因为她胆小。这位式波少女缺乏明日香·美里所熟知的那种鲁莽冲动。起初，这种差异令人震惊。

_She isn't like the other two at all.  
她与另外两人完全不同。_

Lost in her own thoughts, she almost missed Ritsuko's next words.  
沉浸在自己的思绪中，她差点没听到律子接下来的话。

"In any case, I'm sure our mother hen will share if anything comes up."  
"无论如何，我相信我们的'母鸡'妈妈如果有什么情况，一定会告诉我们的。"

Misato sputtered, words failing her and settled for glaring at her friend instead. Ignoring Kaji's quiet laughter, she straightened herself out as the doors opened and they walked out.  
葛城美里一时语塞，只好用眼神瞪着她的朋友。无视加持的轻笑声，她整理了一下自己的仪态，随着门打开，两人走了出去。

"_Hmph_, they'll be staying at the apartment next door. It won't be a problem having Section 2 cover both," she waved them off before they could tease her further.  
"哼，他们将住在隔壁的公寓。让第二科同时负责两边不会有问题，"她挥手打断了他们进一步的调侃。

Coming to a junction, the three said their goodbyes. Ritsuko said she would continue her analysis on the data from the MAGI whilst Kaji would escort Asuka and Soryu to Misato's car.  
来到一个路口，三人互相道别。律子说她将继续分析来自 MAGI 的数据，而加持则负责护送明日香和惣流前往美里车旁。

Shikinami had been kept in a more secure wing and her release would take a little longer.  
式波被关押在更为严密的区域，她的释放需要稍长一些时间。

Just before he pulled away, she quickly grabbed Kaji's arm, stopping him mid-stride. He turned towards her, a smile forming on his face. She spoke before he could spout whatever silly notion had entered his mind.  
就在他即将离开之际，她迅速抓住了加持的手臂，让他停下了脚步。他转向她，脸上浮现出微笑。她抢在他开口说出脑海中那些愚蠢念头之前先发制人。

"Did you remember what I told you about Soryu?" She whispered. Ritsuko had already distanced herself, head buried in her notes but Misato still didn't wish anyone else to overhear.  
"你还记得我跟你说的关于 Soryu 的事吗？" 她低声说道。Ritsuko 已经走远，埋头于她的笔记中，但 Misato 仍然不希望其他人听到。

"Yeah, yeah I'll talk to her," He looked at her with a grim expression, hand scratching the stubble lining his jaw.  
"嗯，嗯，我会跟她谈谈的，" 他看着她，表情严肃，手挠着下巴上的胡茬。

She waited for him to protest. When he didn't, she spoke again, preemptively ready to defend the idea.  
她等他反驳。见他没有，她再次开口，预先准备好为自己的想法辩护。

"It's for Asuka's sake," she looked at him and hoped she wouldn't have to plead but he nodded in agreement.  
"这是为了明日香，" 她看着他，希望自己不必恳求，而他点头同意了。

"Leave it to me," Kaji said and relief washed over her, "but you owe me one." The relief was short-lived.  
"交给我吧，" 加持说，她感到一阵宽慰，"但你欠我一个人情。" 然而，这份宽慰转瞬即逝。

"Owe?" She repeated, starting to regret asking him for his help as she saw the mischievous twinkle in his eye.  
"欠？" 她重复道，开始后悔向他求助，因为他眼中闪烁着调皮的光芒。

"I was thinking a private lesson with 'Miss Misato' would suffice. I'm sure there's _all_ _sorts_ of things you could teach-" She shut him up with a hand over his lips and sighed, closing her eyes briefly before giving him a sharp glare.  
"我在想，和'美里小姐'私下上一节课就够了。我相信你能教的东西多着呢——" 她用手捂住他的嘴，让他闭嘴，叹了口气，闭上眼睛片刻后，用锐利的目光瞪了他一眼。

A glare that quickly softened as their eyes met. He wisely kept quiet and turned to go but not before planting a kiss on her outstretched hand.  
那目光在与他对视后迅速柔和下来。他明智地保持沉默，转身离开，但在离开前，他在她伸出的手上轻轻吻了一下。

The man was persistent, she gave him that. _Kaji, you are going to be the death of me._  
这家伙真是锲而不舍，这点她得承认。加持，你真是要我的命啊。

She watched until he turned the corner and then with a deep breath, returned to her immediate issue; taking the three Asukas home.  
她一直目送他拐过街角，然后深吸一口气，回到眼前的问题：将三个明日香送回家。

With Kaji landing himself extra work she would have to take all three in the car herself, their original plan of having Kaji drive Asuka home himself now scuppered by extra work he had landed himself.  
由于加持自己揽下了额外的工作，她不得不亲自开车载着三个明日香，原本计划由加持单独开车送明日香回家的计划，因他额外的工作而泡汤了。

_It would've softened the blow,_ she thought.  
她想，这本可以减轻打击的。

Asuka wouldn't be pleased with having her two counterparts living next door but Misato wasn't prepared to leave them here , memories of sitting in a cold, clinical facility in the wake of the Second Impact resurfaced and she resolved to allow the girls a fresh start after their confinement over the past week.  
明日香肯定不会高兴有两个自己的副本住在隔壁，但美里并不打算把她们留在这里。她回忆起第二次冲击后坐在冰冷、临床设施中的情景，决心让这些女孩在经过一周的监禁后有一个新的开始。

But first, she would pick up the sleeping beauty whose first act was to punch the Commander in the face.  
但首先，她要去接那个一醒来就给了指挥官一拳的睡美人。

---

Asuka Shikinami Langley. 式波·明日香·兰格雷。

She had been a prodigy, holding the rank of Captain. An Eva pilot. Survivor. But now… now she was adrift. Alone.  
她曾是天才，拥有上尉军衔，是一名 Eva 驾驶员，幸存者。但如今……如今她却漂泊无依，孤身一人。

She stood within a room of Nerv's secure hospital facility and stared out the window. It wasn't the cavernous expanse of Geofront that held her gaze but her own reflection.  
她站在 NERV 安全医院设施的一个房间内，凝视着窗外。吸引她目光的并非广阔的地下都市，而是她自己的倒影。

A pair of blue eyes stared back. The eye patch was clenched in her right hand, no longer needed.  
一双蓝眼睛回望着她。手中的眼罩已不再需要，被她紧紧握在右手。

The _curse of Eva…_ gone.  
伊娃的诅咒……消失了。

It had begun the first night she had arrived, she had felt a new sensation behind the patch.  
一切始于她到达的第一晚，她感觉到眼罩后有一种新的感觉。

No, 'new' wasn't the right word. The return of feeling in her eye also wouldn't be an accurate description. It wasn't an itch either. Pain or otherwise wouldn't have compelled her to take off the covering. The risk was too great.  
不，'新'这个词并不恰当。眼睛恢复知觉的说法也不准确。那也不是痒。无论是疼痛还是其他，都不足以让她冒险摘下眼罩。风险太大了。

'Absence' would be a better description. The absence of the strange, enticing motion of the _other_ that had been contained within her. Always lurking in the background.  
'缺席'或许更为贴切。那种曾蕴含在她体内、奇异而诱人的律动消失了。它总是潜伏在背景中。

Now it was gone. 现在，它不见了。

She had spent that first night debating with herself as to whether she should remove the patch. And when this internal back and forth had stretched her own patience, she had ripped off the eyepatch with a growl.  
她度过第一晚时，一直在内心争论是否该摘掉眼罩。当这种内心的拉锯战让她自己都感到不耐烦时，她便低吼一声，猛地扯掉了眼罩。

Standing in front of the mirror, bathed in Geofront's nocturnal glow, she took in the sight.  
站在镜子前，沐浴在 Geofront 的夜光中，她凝视着镜中的景象。

Her left eye was normal. _Normal._ A deep, sea blue, just like the other. _Normal._ She recalled tears welling up as fast as the realisation hit. Funny thing, she had thought, to finally have full use of both eyes only to be blinded by tears.  
她的左眼是正常的。正常。深邃的海洋蓝，就像另一只一样。正常。她回忆起当时泪水迅速涌上眼眶，就像意识到真相一样快。她觉得挺讽刺的，终于能完全使用双眼，却因为泪水而变得模糊。

_Normal. 正常。_

Alone and adrift in this place, she found herself softly crying as she was overcome with raw emotion.  
独自漂泊于此，她情不自禁地轻声啜泣，被强烈的情感所淹没。

An indulgence she allowed herself a minute or so at most, before she remembered where she was and regained her composure. Controlling her breathing and rubbing away at her face, she glared at the discreet security camera pointed at her and made it a point to keep any further embarrassment to herself.  
她允许自己放纵片刻，至多一分钟，随后便记起身处何地，重拾镇定。调整呼吸，擦干脸庞，她瞪向那台隐蔽的监控摄像头，决心不再让自己陷入尴尬。

_Not my best day,_ she mused looking back at that first night, _at least Mari wasn't there to see it._  
回想那一夜，她暗自思忖，这并非我最佳状态，幸好玛丽不在场目睹。

It wasn't just the eye that had been restored but her appetite too. She looked longingly towards the now empty plate beside her bed. _Hospital_ food. Nothing exciting.  
不仅仅是眼睛恢复了，连她的食欲也回来了。她渴望地望向床边那已空空如也的盘子。医院的食物，毫无惊喜。

But she could _taste_ it. Salads, fresh and sweet crunched in her mouth. Even the lightly seasoned mashed potato - something she previously wouldn't have looked at twice, now made her mouth water.  
但她能尝到味道。新鲜的沙拉，甜脆可口，在嘴里嘎吱作响。就连那略带调味的土豆泥——她以前连看都不会看第二眼的东西，现在也让她垂涎欲滴。

Her stomach rumbled in response to her thoughts.  
她的肚子因她的思绪而咕噜作响。

_Dammit, I just ate too.  
该死，我刚也吃了。_

Deciding to distract herself from the thought of food, she returned to the questions that had plagued her in the days since her arrival.  
为了从食物的念头中分散注意力，她重新回到了自到达以来一直困扰她的问题上。

_How did I get here? Why? And how do I get back?  
我是怎么来到这里的？为什么？我又该如何回去？_

Her mind spun in circles searching for any possible answers.  
她的思绪在原地打转，寻找着任何可能的答案。

None were forthcoming. 然而答案并未出现。

She clenched the eyepatch in her hand.  
她紧握着手中的眼罩。

Being stuck in here was getting her nowhere. Nerv's interest was just in questions and tests. Tests and questions. On and on. _A field day for Dr. Akagi._  
被困在这里毫无进展。NERV 只对提问和测试感兴趣。测试和提问，周而复始。对赤木博士来说，简直是乐此不疲。

Even so, she had managed to figure out a few things.  
即便如此，她还是设法弄清楚了一些事情。

There was still a world here to protect, it hadn't all fallen apart. Civilization endured. It all felt so _strange_. To awaken in a foreign world full of strangers wearing familiar faces was disorientating to say the least.  
这里仍有一个世界需要守护，并未完全崩溃。文明依旧延续。一切感觉如此陌生。在一个充满陌生人的异世界中醒来，他们却长着熟悉的脸庞，这至少可以说是令人困惑的。

_Was this how Shinji felt?  
这就是真嗣的感受吗？_

It wasn't the first time the thought had come to her. And in this place, she could do nothing else _but_ think. And that meant her mind wondered, inevitably, to the boy who had recently reappeared in her life.  
这并不是她第一次产生这样的想法。在这个地方，她除了思考别无他事可做。这意味着她的思绪不可避免地飘向了那个最近重新出现在她生活中的男孩。

_And then there's my two copies.  
还有我的两个复制体。_

Asuka _and_ Soryu; the 'original' of this reality and another guest like her. Different from her but identical to each other. _Almost identical_, she corrected. Soryu was the odd one out of the three.  
明日香与惣流；这个现实的原版和她一样的另一位来客。与她不同，却又彼此相同。几乎相同，她纠正道。惣流是三人中的异类。

_She's not even a pilot!_ She marvelled at the idea of just being an ordinary teenage girl. No Eva's. No Wille or Nerv. No weight of the world on your shoulders. She couldn't even begin to imagine what that was like.  
她甚至不是驾驶员！她惊叹于仅仅作为一个普通少女的想法。没有 EVA。没有 Wille 或 Nerv。没有肩负世界的重担。她甚至无法想象那是什么感觉。

_Could I have had all that?  
我本可以拥有这一切吗？_

Looking at her own lost childhood, what did she feel? Envy? Regret?  
望着自己逝去的童年，她有何感受？是羡慕？还是后悔？

_Too late for either, Asuka._ She was old enough to realise such thinking would do more harm than good. _Comparison is the thief of joy, after all._  
阿苏卡，现在后悔或羡慕都为时已晚。她已足够成熟，明白这种想法弊大于利。毕竟，比较是快乐的小偷。

Still, it was difficult not to think about it when she saw her counterparts. Nerv had attempted to keep contact between the three Asukas to a minimum during the week but the rare times she had crossed paths with Soryu had been surreal.  
然而，当她看到其他自己时，很难不去想这些。Nerv 曾试图在那个星期内尽量减少三个阿苏卡之间的接触，但偶尔与苏尤的偶遇，仍让她感到如梦似幻。

Soryu seemed as unhappy as she herself was with the conditions they were kept under, but would brighten up when spotting her. The annoyed countenance she wore falling away as they passed each other in a hallway or were led in and out of various rooms.  
Soryu 似乎和她一样，对所处的环境感到不满，但一看到她就会精神起来。每当在走廊相遇或被带领进出各个房间时，她那恼怒的表情就会消失。

Shikinami wasn't sure she'd ever get used to hearing her name called out by someone else in her own voice. It was uncanny. But that proved no barrier to Soryu. She would smile and wave. Or complain to her, loudly, about their shared experience before she was whisked away by those assigned to her. She wondered why Soryu seemed so friendly with her. Looks aside, they were still strangers.  
Shikinami 不确定自己是否能习惯听到别人用她自己的声音叫她的名字。这感觉太诡异了。但对 Soryu 来说，这似乎不是障碍。她会微笑着挥手，或者大声向她抱怨她们共同的遭遇，然后被指派给她的人匆匆带走。她不明白为什么 Soryu 对她这么友好。抛开外貌不谈，她们终究还是陌生人。

_Comrades in captivity_, she figured. _It must be even stranger for her._ Shikinami understood the need to latch onto something.  
她想，大概是同为囚徒的缘故吧。对 Soryu 来说，这一定更加奇怪。Shikinami 理解那种想要抓住某种依靠的需求。

_Me, in this case._ She had to admit, Soryu had gotten the little sister act down to a tee.  
说的就是我。她不得不承认，Soryu 扮演小妹妹的角色简直是炉火纯青。

She caught herself smiling in the window's reflection. A testament to how endearing she found it despite her best efforts. Maybe because of all the youthful, doe eyed innocence being directed at her.  
她在窗户的倒影中发现自己正微笑着。这证明了尽管她极力抗拒，但还是觉得这一幕十分可爱。或许是因为那股青春洋溢、眼神纯真的无辜感正向她袭来。

_Hmph! This place is making me soft.  
哼！这个地方让我变得软弱了。_

And then there was 'Asuka'. _This_ world's Asuka.  
然后就有了‘明日香’。这个世界的明日香。

In contrast to Soryu, she and Asuka had hardly spoken a word after their first meeting. In the few chance meetings between the two, she had been treated with suspicion by the girl. More often than not, Asuka would make it a point to ignore her. Shikinami was seen as nothing more than an intruder.  
与惣流相比，她和明日香在初次见面后几乎没说过一句话。在两人寥寥几次的偶遇中，她总是被那个女孩投以怀疑的目光。大多数时候，明日香都会故意忽视她。式波被视为一个不折不扣的闯入者。

She could only shake her , her first impressions of the redheaded pilot hadn't changed at all.  
她只能摇头，她对那位红发驾驶员的第一印象丝毫未变。

_Would I be any different in her shoes? At her age?  
如果我处在她的位置，年纪与她相仿，我会不会有所不同？_

She couldn't be sure. Perhaps it was a good thing they didn't talk. She could guess they would have little in common at this point. _I'm not the 14 year old girl I used to be, this isn't the same Nerv and she's not me._  
她无法确定。或许他们不交谈是件好事。她猜想，此时此刻，他们之间恐怕已无多少共同之处。我已经不是那个 14 岁的小女孩了，这里也不再是曾经的 NERV，而她，也不是我。

There was a knock on the door.  
门外传来了敲门声。

_"_It's Misato, I'm coming in_,"_ said the voice from the other side.  
"是美里，我要进来了，" 门那边传来声音。

In a well practised motion, the eye patch was on again.  
熟练地，眼罩再次戴上了。

With all the poking and prodding done to her over the past week, there was no way she could keep the reason for the covering hidden forever so she'd made a convenient excuse;  
经过过去一周的反复检查和询问，她无法永远隐瞒遮盖的原因，于是她找了个方便的借口；

_"Injury during my last battle. It's very sensitive to bright light, so I have to cover it. Doctor's orders!"  
"上次战斗中受的伤。它对强光非常敏感，所以我必须遮住它。这是医生的嘱咐！"_

_"I see."_ Dr. Akagi had said, no doubt guessing the 'doctor' in question was her otherworld counterpart. The answer was enough to stop further questions. Explaining she had been infected by an Angel during a disastrous activation attempt would've seen her put under the foot of an Eva in no time at all.  
"我明白了。"赤木博士说道，无疑猜到那位'医生'是她在另一个世界的对应人物。这个回答足以阻止进一步的追问。如果解释说她在一次灾难性的激活尝试中被使徒感染，那她很快就会被置于一台 Eva 的脚下。

She also wasn't sure how she would explain that the NERV they all knew and worked for was no more. It would just be more trouble for her considering Gendo Ikari was in charge here.  
她也不确定该如何解释他们所熟知并为之工作的 NERV 已经不复存在。考虑到这里由碇源堂负责，这只会给她带来更多麻烦。

Telling them the last Angel she had fought fell from the sky somewhat matched up with current events in this world. She didn't push her luck any further with a more elaborate story.  
告诉他们她上次战斗的天使是从天而降的，这与这个世界的当前事件有些吻合。她没有再冒险编造更复杂的故事。

The door opened and like a vision out of the past, Misato stepped through. Younger than the Captain of the _Wunder_, this Misato was still filled with the youthful determination of career military. Someone who had yet to lose nearly everything she held dear. Shikinami couldn't help but compare.  
门开了，仿佛穿越时空的幻影，美里走了进来。比 Wunder 号的舰长年轻，这位美里仍充满着职业军人的青春决心。一个还未失去她珍视的一切的人。式波不禁比较起来。

_The years haven't been kind to any of us,_ the thought was laced with bitterness and she spoke before she could dwell on it further.  
岁月对我们谁都不仁慈，这个念头带着苦涩，她还没来得及深思就脱口而出。

"So? What's the verdict?" She held her head high, ready for Misato's answer.  
"那么？判决是什么？" 她昂首挺胸，准备接受美里给出的答案。

Misato closed the door behind first, holding a bag full of _something_ close to her as she moved to sit on the bed. She didn't speak straight away.  
美里先是关上了门，手里紧握着一个装满东西的袋子，走到床边坐下。她并没有立刻开口。

Shikinami had noticed it was something they all did - as if checking to make sure she wasn't an apparition. _No surprises there. This is as strange for them as it is for me._  
式波注意到他们都这样做——仿佛在确认她不是幻影。这并不意外。这对他们来说和我一样奇怪。

When Misato finally spoke, she smiled and gestured towards the bag.  
当碇真嗣终于开口时，她微笑着指向那个袋子。

"Clothes. You'll be needing them when you leave. I'm taking you to my place." She clarified it would be to an apartment next to her own. They would keep both her and Soryu under close watch, but they would be allowed some freedom of movement.  
衣服。你离开时会需要它们。我要带你去我住的地方。" 她解释说，那将是她自己公寓隔壁的一间。他们将密切监视她和渚薰，但他们会允许他们有一定的行动自由。

_They're letting me go?_ She had expected to be moved to somewhere else on the base, under lock and key for more testing. Or maybe as far away from the city as possible, a prisoner.  
他们要放我走？她本以为会被转移到基地的另一个地方，被锁起来接受更多测试。或者可能被送到远离城市的某个地方，成为一名囚犯。

But back to the old apartment?  
但是回到旧公寓吗？

_Free._

A mixture of emotions hit her. Happiness, now that she was leaving the hospital, accompanied by bittersweet memories of her own short time in the apartment. Misato must've picked up on her conflicting emotions.  
各种情绪涌上心头。幸福，因为她即将离开医院，伴随着在公寓短暂时光中的苦乐参半的回忆。明日香肯定察觉到了她复杂的情绪。

"Hey, it's not that bad. Shinji will have cooked up something for you guys. You said you knew him, right?"  
嘿，没那么糟。真嗣肯定已经为你们准备好了什么。你说过你认识他，对吧？

_Ah._

Shinji.  真嗣。

She became acutely aware of how dry her mouth felt.  
她突然意识到自己的嘴巴有多么干涩。

There had always been a possibility she would meet him. She knew that. So why did hearing his name seem to put her on edge?  
她一直都知道有可能会遇见他。她明白这一点。但为什么听到他的名字会让她感到不安呢？

He wasn't the same boy, she needed to remember that.  
他已经不是那个男孩了，她必须记住这一点。_._

_So he lives with Misato here too._ While she had divulged to Misato and the others about her life working for Nerv, few details had been shared in return. That included information on anyone she hadn't currently come into contact with. She could hardly blame them given the circumstances.  
所以他现在也和美里住在这里。虽然她向美里和其他人透露了自己在 NERV 工作的经历，但对方回馈的细节却寥寥无几。这包括了她尚未接触到的任何人的信息。考虑到当前的情况，她也无法责怪他们。

_Well, it's not like I've shared anything about Wille either._ Secrets seemed part and parcel of a life connected with Eva.  
再说，我也没透露过关于 Wille 的任何事情。秘密似乎是与 Eva 相关的生活中不可或缺的一部分。

"Are you _finally_ convinced I'm not an Angel?" She said with a little bluster, hoping Misato didn't pick up on her thoughts. She looked Misato in the eye who returned it with a familiar steely glare. _There's the Misato I know._  
"你终于相信我不是天使了吗？" 她略带挑衅地说道，希望碇真嗣没有察觉到她的心思。她直视着碇真嗣的眼睛，对方也以熟悉的锐利目光回望。这才是我认识的碇真嗣。

"If I wasn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation."  
"如果我不信，我们就不会有这次对话了。"

Nothing further was said and she changed into the clothes provided. It was the same middle school uniform of her youth. _"Hey, it fits doesn't it?"_ was Misato's reply at her dubious look. Leaving the room, they headed for the parking garage.  
之后两人没有再多说什么，她换上了提供的衣服。那是她年轻时穿过的中学校服。"嘿，挺合身的吧？" 碇真嗣在她疑惑的眼神中回应道。离开房间，他们向停车场走去。

Misato told her they would meet the other two girls at her car. The original plan had been for Misato to take her and Soryu, whilst Kaji drove their Asuka to the apartment separately, but apparently some unexpected work had come up.  
碇真嗣告诉她，他们将在她的车里与其他两位女孩会合。原计划是碇真嗣带她和绫波，而加持则单独开车送明日香到公寓，但显然出现了一些意外的工作。

Misato relayed this information whilst in the same breath complaining about Kaji's inability to keep his mouth shut - _"Stuck up jerk!"_  
碇真嗣在传达这一信息的同时，还不忘抱怨加持那张管不住的嘴——“自大的混蛋！”

Now in the lift, Shikinami listened to the soft _tick, tick, tick,_ counting up to the level they needed to be. It gave her time to think about where she was headed. _Out into the city._  
此刻在电梯里，式波听着那轻柔的滴答声，数着上升到所需楼层的数字。这给了她时间去思考自己即将前往的地方。是那座城市的外面。

It had been a long time since she'd seen it. So long that it now seemed almost another life, not her own. Whilst memories of living with Misato and Shinji were clear, her picture of what lay beyond the confines of the apartment was much hazier.  
她已经很久没有见过它了。久到仿佛是另一段人生，不属于自己。与美里和真嗣共同生活的记忆清晰可见，但对于公寓之外的世界，她的印象却模糊得多。

A thought hit her and she tentatively voiced it before she could change her mind. She was unsure what Misato would think of the request.  
一个念头突然闪现，她犹豫着说出了口，生怕自己改变主意。她不确定美里会如何看待这个请求。

"Mind if we take a slight detour on the way back?"  
“回去的路上，介意我们稍微绕个道吗？”

A moment's hesitation before a raised eyebrow was directed at her.  
犹豫片刻后，一道挑起的眉毛向她投去。

"Where to?" 去哪儿？

Shikinami told her. Misato paused before a small smile graced her features. She nodded.  
真希波告诉了她。葛城美里停顿了一下，随后一丝微笑浮现在她的脸上。她点了点头。

"Yeah, we can do that. You know, I'm still not entirely sure what to think about all this but I _think_ we'll get along just fine," she gave a nod in gratitude before holding out her hand.  
"嗯，我们可以这么做。你知道，我还没完全想明白这一切，但我想我们会相处得很好的，"她感激地点了点头，然后伸出手来。

"Misato Katsuragi, nice to meet you… again," she winked.  
"葛城美里，很高兴再次见到你…"她眨了眨眼。

Shikinami regarded the other woman for a moment before allowing herself a smile in return. She took the offered hand.  
式波打量了对方一会儿，然后回以微笑，握住了伸出的手。

"Asuka Shikinami Langley, charmed."  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷，很高兴认识你。"

Again, there was that nostalgic feeling of _home._ She could feel a burning sensation behind her eyes but managed to hold back. _No_ _tears this time, okay?_ she promised herself.  
再次，那种怀旧的家的感觉涌上心头。她感到眼后一阵灼热，但努力忍住了。这次不许哭，好吗？她对自己承诺。

After all, none of this would last.  
毕竟，这一切都不会持久。

Already, too much time had been spent here. She still had a job to do. She wouldn't leave the rest of Wille on their own. And she wouldn't leave _him._  
已经在这里耽搁太久了。她还有任务在身。她不会丢下维尔的其他成员不管。也不会丢下他。

But with no clue as to how to return, she would have to be patient. Well, waiting was something she had plenty of experience with. Until then…  
但既然毫无返回的头绪，她只能耐心等待。等待，她可是经验丰富。在那之前……

_Maybe it won't be so bad after all, if only for a little while.  
或许，只是短暂停留，也不会太糟吧。_

They exited the lift and she felt the fresh cool air against her face. And with it, the sound of two very familiar voices.  
他们走出电梯，她感受到迎面而来的清新凉风。随之而来的，还有两个非常熟悉的声音。

_What now? 现在怎么办？_

---

"It's not _your_ car, you fake. Misato's my guardian and I always sit at the front. So shove off!"  
这不是你的车，你这个冒牌货。美里是我的监护人，我总是坐在前面。所以滚开！

Asuka stamped her foot as she squared off against Soryu. Both stood beside the passenger side door of the car. The door was open but neither had managed to sit.  
明日香跺着脚，与惣流对峙着。两人站在汽车乘客侧的门旁。门是开着的，但谁也没能坐进去。

It began when they both reached for the same door, wanting the same seat. Ten minutes later and neither she nor Soryu had given any ground.  
一切始于两人同时伸手去拉同一扇门，争夺同一个座位。十分钟后，她和惣流谁也没有退让。

Stubbornness was a universal character trait it seemed.  
看来，固执是普遍的性格特征。

_The nerve of this girl. She's not only taken my looks, she wants my transport too!  
这女孩真是胆大包天。她不仅夺走了我的美貌，还想抢走我的交通工具！_

"Shouldn't you give priority to a _civilian_ like myself?" Soryu said, not even attempting to hide the mockery in her voice, flipping her hair over her shoulder in the exact same manner Asuka knew she herself had done countless times before.  
“像我这样的平民，你不应该优先考虑吗？”索玉说，丝毫没有掩饰声音中的嘲讽，她将头发甩到肩后，动作与明日香自己无数次做过的如出一辙。

Soryu had made it clear Asuka's designation as a 'Pilot' meant nothing to her. And Asuka had been ordered not to divulge any more than was necessary to the girl. To Asuka this was like fighting with one metaphorical hand behind her back.  
索玉已经明确表示，明日香作为'驾驶员'的身份对她来说毫无意义。而明日香也被命令不得向女孩透露超出必要的信息。对明日香来说，这就像是在战斗中一只手被束缚在背后一样。

_Hmph! It would just be unfair otherwise, I can still put her in her place on my own._ She grit her teeth.  
哼！不然就太不公平了，我自己还能让她知道厉害。她咬紧牙关。

_Damn you Kaji, damn your paperwork._ The man had left the two by the car citing a mountain of reports he had to get through. _As if!_ Maybe there was some truth to Misato's near constant complaints about the man's reliability?  
该死的卡吉，该死的文书工作。那人把他们俩留在车旁，借口说有一大堆报告要处理。骗谁呢！也许真如美里几乎不断的抱怨，那人的可靠性确实有问题？

She would have to remember to get double the amount of ice-cream next time he took her out. He owed her for this.  
她得记住下次他带她出去时，要买双倍的冰淇淋。他欠她的。

If there was one good thing to come out of this mess it was the decision that only she would go by the name Asuka; the other two got their own names for the sake of everyone's sanity.  
如果说这场混乱中有什么好事的话，那就是决定只有她会使用明日香这个名字；其他两人为了大家的理智，都各自有了自己的名字。

It was time to remind her of that point, she decided.  
是时候提醒她这一点了，她决定。

She cleared her throat. 她清了清嗓子。

"Well, _Soryu-_" "嗯，Soryu——"

"That's _Miss_ Soryu to you!" Soryu said, interrupting her with a hand raised to cover her mock laughter, "_Geez,_ don't they teach you pilots any manners?"  
"对你来说，应该是 Soryu 小姐！" Soryu 说着，举起手来遮住她那装出来的笑声，打断了她，"天哪，他们难道没教过你们飞行员任何礼貌吗？"

Asuka suppressed a growl of frustration, the short exchange a frank reminder why she had not bothered making talk with either of them.  
Asuka 强压下内心的烦躁，这短暂的交流直白地提醒了她，为何她一直懒得与他们两人交谈。

It was almost worth it going through Dr. Akagi's hellish regime of tests to confirm what she'd known all along; she was the one and only Second Child, designated pilot of Unit-02. No one could take that away from her.  
经历赤木博士那如同地狱般的测试制度，几乎值得，只为确认她一直心知肚明的事实；她是独一无二的第二适格者，零号机二号机的指定驾驶员。这份荣耀，无人能夺。

She hadn't been worried at all.  
她根本就没有担心过。

And that was supposed to be the end of it, right?  
这本该就是结局了，对吧？

_Wrong! Now they're coming to live with us? And next door to me? To Shinji?  
错了！现在他们要搬来和我们一起住？还住我隔壁？住真嗣隔壁？_

At least the Shikinami girl seemed to have the good sense to keep to herself.  
至少那个式波女孩看起来还有点自知之明，懂得保持距离。

And Soryu? Well, Soryu _didn't._ Sense played no part in the girl's actions if the past week was any indication. She was loud and obnoxious.  
至于惣流？唉，惣流可不这样。如果过去一周能说明什么的话，她的行为里可没有‘理智’二字。她吵闹又烦人。

_Hmph, nothing I can't handle but…  
哼，没什么我应付不了的，但是…_

Shinji. 真嗣。

_He's like a lamb, defenceless_. He already crumbled when she paid the barest attention to him, what would his reaction to Soryu and Shikinami be? What would Soryu do?  
他就像一只羔羊，毫无防备。她只是稍微关注了一下，他就崩溃了，面对索琉和式波，他又会有什么反应？索琉会怎么做呢？

She played innocent but Asuka knew a wolf in sheep's clothing when she saw one.  
她装作无辜，但明日香一眼就能看出披着羊皮的狼。

_I have to step in, for his sake of course._ _His simple nature would be taken in by her beauty. She'd take advantage of him!_  
我必须介入，当然是为了他好。他那单纯的本性定会被她的美貌所迷惑。她会利用他的！

There was also a question of their new living arrangements. Having the girls next door was _far_ too close for comfort as far as Asuka was concerned. She knew what would happen, Misato would give them free reign to come and go and soon they'd spend all their time there.  
还有他们新的居住安排问题。对明日香来说，女孩们住在隔壁实在是太近了，让人感到不安。她知道会发生什么，美里会任由她们自由出入，很快她们就会整天待在那里。

Well, not if she had anything to say about it! The apartment was _her_ domain and she wasn't about to let Soryu or anyone else claim it for themselves. Otherwise…  
哼，只要她还有发言权，就绝不允许！这间公寓是她的领地，她绝不会让惣流或其他任何人占为己有。否则……

_Otherwise? 否则呢？_

Frighteningly fast, images of Shinji in nothing but an apron obediently serving strawberries and cream to the girl whilst she sunbathed on the balcony came to mind. Pen Pen was there too, keeping her cool with a large fan. She assumed it was _Soryu_ and not _herself_ because this was definitely _not_ something she had imagined before.  
快得令人害怕，脑海中浮现出只穿围裙的真嗣，顺从地给在阳台上晒太阳的女孩端上草莓和奶油的画面。企鹅 Pen Pen 也在那里，用一把大扇子帮她降温。她猜想那是惣流而不是自己，因为这绝对不是她之前想象过的场景。

Why Soryu would be wearing one of Asuka's more risque bathing suits, the one she was saving for Kaji, she had no idea but again, it was _absolutely_ not her.  
为什么惣流会穿上明日香那件更为大胆的泳装，那件她本是为加持先生准备的，她毫无头绪，但可以肯定，那绝不是她自己。

Of course not. 当然不是。

The uncomfortable question as to why the fantasy came so readily to her was blamed on Shinji.  
她为何如此轻易陷入幻想的尴尬问题，被归咎于真嗣。

_Ugh! I've been infected by Shinji's pervertedness.  
呃！我被真嗣的猥琐感染了。_

Snapping out of it, she banished the foolish thought before the heat on her face became obvious. Asuka narrowed her eyes at Soryu and prepared to make it known she wouldn't put up with her childish antics any further.  
回过神来，她赶忙驱散了那愚蠢的念头，免得脸上的红晕变得明显。明日香眯起眼睛盯着惣流，准备表明自己不会再容忍她的幼稚行为。

Fortunately for the hearing of all Nerv employees in the vicinity, fate stepped in. Or more accurately, _stepped between_ the two girls and sat in the once vacant seat of the car.  
幸运的是，命运介入了，为附近所有 NERV 员工的听力保驾护航。更确切地说，是介入了两个女孩之间，坐在了原本空着的座位上。

_Huh?_

Both Asukas blinked and looked down.  
两位明日香同时眨了眨眼，低头看去。

Shikinami looked up. 式波抬头望去。

The seatbelt fastened with a _click!_ as Shikinami, dropping her usual sullen look, smiled triumphantly back at them and now sat comfortably within.  
安全带‘咔嚓’一声扣紧，式波一改往日的阴郁表情，得意地回头对他们笑了笑，现在舒适地坐在里面。

"_Ehhh?!_" Asuka sputtered, completely lost for words.  
“诶？！”明日香结巴着，完全无言以对。

_Is this really happening?_ It had to be divine punishment, she reasoned. Karma for all the Angels she'd killed. Hands balled into fists, she was just about ready to explode at both of them when Misato appeared.  
这真的在发生吗？她认为这一定是天谴，是所有她杀死的使徒的报应。双手紧握成拳，她几乎要对他们两个爆发了，这时葛城美里出现了。

"Good, you're both here! Kaji leave you?"  
太好了，你们俩都在这里！加持把你丢下了？

Asuka kept her silence at which Misato could only chuckle.  
明日香保持沉默，对此葛城美里只能苦笑。

"Yeah, he does that," Misato said. She then turned to Soryu.  
"是啊，他就这样，" 葛城说。随后她转向了惣流。

"Miss Soryu, if you'd like to take a seat, we're leaving. We can discuss the plan for you guys on the way home. Is that okay?" There it was, that _motherly_ tone again.  
"惣流小姐，如果您愿意坐下的话，我们就要出发了。回家的路上我们可以讨论一下对你们的计划。这样可以吗？" 那母性的语气又来了。

Asuka gawked as Soryu smiled cheerfully, brightening in an instant.  
明日香目瞪口呆地看着惣流，她瞬间露出了灿烂的笑容。

"Sure thing, Miss Misato!"  
"当然可以，碇司令！"

She watched Soryu skip round the other side of the car to sit behind Misato's seat. As one final act when Misato's back was turned, she stuck her tongue out at Asuka - _"Bleh!"_ - before getting in.  
她看着 Soryu 绕到车的另一边，坐在碇司令座位后面。在碇司令转过身去的最后一刻，她向 Asuka 吐了吐舌头——“呸！”——然后上了车。

_What is she, a ten year old?  
她这是，十岁小孩吗？_

With Misato settling into the driver's seat this left Asuka as the last one standing. _How did it end up like this?_  
随着碇真嗣坐进驾驶座，明日香成了最后一个站着的人。事情怎么会变成这样？

"Asuka, you coming?" said Misato.  
“明日香，你来吗？”碇真嗣说道。

"Yeah, yeah…" she grumbled, finally taking the remaining seat. She gave an evil look to Soryu and turned to stare out the window. She took little notice of the conversion in the car as they drove out of the Geofront; mostly questions from Soryu asking Misato about Nerv and the city. Asuka was happy to be left alone, still bothered by her guardian's earlier tone when speaking to Soryu.  
“来了，来了…”她嘟囔着，终于坐进了剩下的座位。她恶狠狠地瞪了碇真嗣一眼，然后转头望向窗外。她几乎没有注意到车内的对话，因为他们驶出了第三新东京市；主要是碇真嗣向碇源堂询问 NERV 和城市的问题。明日香很高兴能独自一人，仍然对她监护人之前与碇真嗣交谈时的语气感到困扰。

_Like when she speaks to Shinji and Rei. Do they know she treats them like children?  
就像她与真嗣和绫波交谈时那样。他们知道她把他们当孩子看待吗？_

It wasn't the first time Asuka heard that kind of voice from Misato. Before, she hadn't cared. But now? Now all she knew was that it annoyed her.  
这不是明日香第一次从美里那里听到这种声音。以前，她并不在意。但现在？现在她只知道这让她感到烦躁。

She sank into the seat and watched the city fly past with half closed eyes.  
她沉入座位，半闭着眼睛看着城市飞驰而过。

It was as if the weight of the whole week had crashed down upon her and she let her mind wander. Is it going to rain? Would she be too tired to eat when she got home? What had Shinji cooked? Had Hikari dropped off any homework?  
仿佛整周的重压突然倾泻而下，她任由思绪飘散。会下雨吗？到家时她会不会累得吃不下饭？真嗣做了什么菜？明日香有没有送来作业？

Even so, the thought remained.  
即便如此，这个念头依旧挥之不去。

_A child. Is that what I am to everyone?  
一个孩子。难道这就是我在每个人眼中的形象吗？_

---

Tokyo-3. 第三新东京市。

A city that rose from the ground to turn a quiet valley into a forest of steel. The evening sunlight created a kaleidoscope of colours as it reflected off towers of metal and glass and they cast dark shadows that stretched across the landscape.  
一座从地面崛起，将宁静的山谷变为钢铁森林的城市。傍晚的阳光在金属与玻璃构成的塔楼间反射，形成五彩斑斓的万花筒，而它们投下的深邃阴影则横亘在整个地貌之上。

A fortress city. 一座堡垒城市。

Soryu had stood with her mouth open as alarms wailed in the distance, speechless at the rising city blocks in front of her. Just another reminder as to how incomprehensibly different this world was to her own.  
Soryu 站在那里，嘴巴张得大大的，远处的警报声此起彼伏，面对眼前升起的城市街区，她无言以对。这不过是又一次提醒她，这个世界与她所知的有多么难以理解的差异。

_There's nothing like this in Tokyo,_ she thought. And then looking over to Asuka - _their_ Asuka. _So this is where she lives?_  
东京可没有这样的景象，她心想。然后转头看向 Asuka——他们的 Asuka。难道这就是她居住的地方？

She couldn't help but be impressed with it all. It was something she would've laughed off as a joke if she hadn't seen it all for herself. The _ginormous_ cavern underneath, that blue robot she saw stalking around. And now this.  
她不禁对这一切感到惊叹。如果她没有亲眼所见，这一切她可能会当作笑话一笑置之。那巨大的地下洞穴，她看到的那个四处游荡的蓝色机器人。而现在，这一切都展现在她眼前。

Asuka had watched quietly, seemingly bored. Like it was just another day to her. _She lives here, after all. And she pilots a robot too!_  
明日香静静地看着，看似无聊。对她来说，这只是又一个平凡的日子。毕竟，她就住在这里。而且，她还驾驶着机器人呢！

_And she's also an orphan,_ the sombre thought crossed her mind as she recalled her little chat with Mr. Kaji.  
她还是个孤儿，这个沉重的念头掠过她的脑海，她回忆起与葛城先生的小谈话。

---

She had just been told she would be leaving to stay near Miss Misato's apartment. Before they left the room, he turned to her.  
她刚被告知将搬去住在美里小姐公寓附近。在他们离开房间之前，他转向她。

"There's something you should know," his tone of voice lacked the usual joviality she had come to expect. This got her attention more than anything else.  
"有件事你应该知道，" 他的语气失去了她所习惯的那种欢快。这比其他任何事情都更能引起她的注意。

"What?" "什么？"

"Asuka lost her mother when she was very young."  
"明日香很小的时候就失去了母亲。"

The information and the bluntness of it shocked her.  
这个消息及其直白的方式让她感到震惊。

"W-what…how?" "什…什么…怎么回事？"

"It's not for me to say. But I would appreciate it if you didn't ask her about it."  
"这我不好说。但如果你不向她提起这件事，我会很感激的。"

She swallowed a hard lump in her throat. Feeling her pulse quicken, her mind raced as she tried to imagine a life without her mother.  
她艰难地咽下一口唾沫。感觉到脉搏加速，她的思绪飞快地运转，试图想象没有母亲的生活。

"Why… why are you telling me this?" She felt sick. _Mama…_  
"为什么…你为什么要告诉我这些？" 她感到一阵恶心。妈妈…

The man only shrugged. 那男人只是耸了耸肩。

"You would have found out eventually. Better you hear it from me now rather than ask her about it, later. And I'm telling you because I care."  
"你迟早会知道的。与其将来从她那里得知，不如现在由我来告诉你。我告诉你，是因为我在乎你。"

"For her?" "为了她？"

"For _both_ of you," he sounded sincere, "so, do you agree?"  
"为了你们俩，" 他听起来很真诚，"那么，你同意吗？"

Realising he had been waiting for a reply, she nodded, unable to say anymore. Mr. Kaji smiled gratefully and said he would treat her to ice-cream sometime.  
意识到他一直在等待答复，她点了点头，无法再说更多。卡吉先生感激地笑了笑，并表示将来会请她吃冰淇淋。

She wasn't quite sure why he thought this would appeal to her but didn't push it. She stayed silent all the way to Asuka's room.  
她不太确定为什么他会认为这会吸引她，但没有深究。她一路沉默地跟着他到了飞鸟的房间。

---

It certainly explained some things about her.  
这确实解释了她的一些事情。

Maybe her original opinion of the girl had been too harsh. Still, would it kill her to be a little nicer? They were practically twins.  
也许她最初对这个女孩的看法过于苛刻了。尽管如此，稍微友好一点会要她的命吗？她们几乎就是双胞胎。

Not like Shikinami at all.  
一点也不像式波。

Who was _much_ easier to like, she reasoned. She attributed this to the fact that the girl kept quiet most of the time or maybe she felt an affinity for their shared circumstances.  
她认为，这更容易让人喜欢。她将这一点归因于女孩大部分时间都很安静，或者也许她对她们共同的处境感到共鸣。

Shikinami carried an air of maturity that neither she nor the other Asuka seemed to possess. She hadn't seen her complain or argue, she had taken this past week all in stride. _Very_ cool. Shikinami even listened to her when she was in her more grumpy moods. Was she standoffish? Sure, but not outright rude.  
式波散发着一种成熟气质，这是她或其他明日香所不具备的。她没见过式波抱怨或争吵，她对过去这一周都泰然处之。非常冷静。即使在她的脾气更暴躁的时候，式波也会倾听她的话。她是否有些疏远？当然，但并不粗鲁。

The auburn haired girl now stood beside her, Soryu could only see the side of her face covered by the eye patch. Her mouth was pressed into a thin line. Soryu wondered what she was thinking, she knew that Shikinami was a pilot, like Asuka.  
此刻，那位红褐色头发的女孩站在她身旁，Soryu 只能看到她被眼罩遮住的侧脸。她的嘴唇紧抿成一条细线。Soryu 好奇她在想些什么，她知道 Shikinami 也是一名驾驶员，就像 Asuka 一样。

Leaning forward against the rails, she decided to ask.  
她身体前倾，靠在栏杆上，决定开口询问。

"Is your home like this too?"  
“你的家乡也是这样的吗？”

Shikinami kept her silence and for a second she wondered if the girl hadn't heard her. But then she turned to look directly at her with her uncovered eye.  
式波保持沉默，有那么一瞬间她怀疑那个女孩是否没听见她的话。但随后，她转过身来，用那只未遮掩的眼睛直视着她。

"It was," Shikinami said quietly. She waited to see if this was elaborated upon. It wasn't.  
“确实是这样，”式波轻声说道。她等待着看是否会有进一步的解释。但没有。

_So it's not anymore? 那么现在不是了吗？_

As if sensing her probing thoughts, Shikinami turned and walked away. Soryu watched the girl pause to thank Miss Misato for the stop, before heading back towards the car.  
仿佛察觉到她的探寻思绪，式波转身离去。真嗣看着那女孩停下脚步，向美里小姐道谢后，才朝车子走去。

Asuka, who hadn't said a word during the entire time, also left. She wasn't yet sure what to make of either of them and her face scrunched up in thought  
整个过程中一言未发的明日香也离开了。她对这两个人还没形成什么看法，脸上露出思索的表情

"I wouldn't worry," Miss Misato said as she walked up to her, noticing the look on her face.  
“不用担心，”美里小姐走过来对她说，注意到她脸上的表情。

"Hmph, I'm not worried," she turned to face the city again hoping the older woman didn't pry any further.  
"哼，我可不担心，"她再次转向城市，希望那位年长女士不要再追问下去。

Seeing her homeroom teacher as a badass military lady would take some getting used to. _And she's in charge of real, giant robots!_ It still seemed ridiculous to her despite everything she had seen.  
把班主任看作是酷炫的军事女强人，这得花点时间适应。而且她还负责真正的巨型机器人！尽管她已经见识过一切，这仍然让她觉得荒谬。

"Well, Miss Soryu, are you ready to meet our Shinji?"  
"那么，Soryu 小姐，准备好见我们的 Shinji 了吗？"

She nodded in reply to the question, not quite trusting herself to speak. She hoped the evening sunlight was enough to hide the colour on her face.  
她点头回应了那个问题，不太相信自己能开口说话。她希望傍晚的阳光足以遮掩她脸上的红晕。

'_Our Shinji' she said. Not mine, but theirs. Gotta remember that._ This wasn't going to be the boy she had known since childhood.  
'我们的真嗣'，她说。不是我的，而是他们的。得记住这一点。这不会是她从小认识的那个男孩。

There was also one other important detail she had omitted regarding her relationship with the Shinji she knew.  
关于她与她所认识的真嗣之间的关系，她还遗漏了一个重要的细节。

_And as long as they don't ask, I won't need to tell them.  
只要他们不问，我就不必告诉他们。_

Every familiar face she had met so far had managed to surprise her.  
到目前为止，她遇到的每一张熟悉的面孔都让她感到意外。

_How different could he be?  
他能有多不同呢？_

---

Shinji hit _pause_ on his SDAT, taking out the earbuds to survey the kitchen in silence.  
真嗣按下了他的 SDAT 暂停键，取出耳塞，静静地审视着厨房。

_It's done. 完成了。_

In an uncharacteristic display of self-confidence, he was looking forward to seeing his roommate's faces when they saw the beef and rice bowl dish he had prepared. The table was set, the food was ready and the apartment itself was cleaner than it had been in months.  
他一反常态地展现出自信，期待着看到室友们见到他准备的牛肉盖饭时的表情。餐桌已布置好，食物准备就绪，公寓本身也比几个月来都要干净。

For this evening at least, they could have a nice, pleasant meal.  
至少今晚，他们可以享用一顿美好而愉快的晚餐。

_And then back to usual tomorrow._ He couldn't help but sigh.  
然后明天一切照旧。他不禁叹了口气。

"I guess it was never going to last, right Pen Pen?"  
我想这终究不会持久，对吧，Pen Pen？

"Wark, wark!" said the penguin. Shinji looked down at his avian room mate, a small frown forming.  
"Wark, wark!" 企鹅叫道。真嗣低头看着他的鸟类室友，眉头微微皱起。

"Don't let Asuka hear you say that," he paused to consider the penguin's rewarks, "she can be nice when she wants to be."  
"别让明日香听到你说这个，"他停顿了一下，考虑着企鹅的评论，"她想对谁好的时候还是挺好的。"

Pen Pen gave his equivalent of a shrug at the chiding and waddled off to his fridge leaving Shinji alone.  
面对这番责备，企鹅潘潘做出了类似耸肩的动作，然后摇摇摆摆地走向自己的冰箱，留下真嗣一个人。

Not long after, the sound of the door opening along with Misato's _"We're home!"_ reached his ears.  
不久后，随着美里的一声“我们回来了！”，开门声传入他的耳中。

_They're back! 他们回来了！_

He turned to smile as Asuka and Misato entered the kitchen.  
他转过身，微笑着迎接进入厨房的明日香和美里。

"Ah, hi Misato, Asuka. H-how are-"  
"啊，嗨，美里，明日香。你们……你们好吗？"

The two 'guests' filed in behind his roommates and all of a sudden the kitchen seemed like a much smaller space.  
两位'客人'跟在他的室友后面鱼贯而入，突然间厨房显得狭小了许多。

It wasn't the number of people on Shinji's mind however as he took in the sight of three _identical_ Asukas.  
然而，让真嗣心神不宁的不是人数，而是他眼前出现了三个一模一样的明日香。

His mind raced to catch up with what his eyes were telling him. All three wrote the same school uniform. That one of them wore an eyepatch with hair a slightly different shade to the other two hadn't registered just yet.  
他的思绪急速运转，试图跟上眼睛所见的一切。三人都穿着同样的校服。其中一人戴着眼罩，发色与另外两人略有不同，这一细节他还没来得及注意到。

Silence. 沉默。

And then, with all the faculties left to him, Shinji remembered his role as the dutiful host and managed to squeak out a proper greeting.  
随后，竭尽所能，真嗣记起了自己作为尽责主人的角色，勉强挤出了一个得体的问候。

"Uh…"

Well, almost. As if to take pity, one of the Asukas raised her hand in greeting.  
嗯，差不多。仿佛出于怜悯，其中一位明日香举起手来打招呼。

"Hello, Shinji," she said and gave him a smile. A smile that radiated warmth and friendship.  
"“你好，真嗣，”她说着，露出了一个笑容。那笑容散发着温暖与友情的光芒。”

Shinji fainted. 真嗣晕倒了。

For a moment, no one said anything. Then, as if on some unspoken cue, all three sighed in exasperation.  
一时间，谁也没有说话。随后，仿佛收到了某种无声的信号，三人不约而同地叹了口气，显得十分无奈。

"Idiot," they said. “笨蛋，”他们说道。

---

_"You're an Eva pilot too? That's amazing!"  
"你也是 Eva 驾驶员吗？太厉害了！"_

Misato only half-heartedly listened to the conversation at the table. Once Shinji had woken up and been assured for the nth time that he wasn't dreaming, with a little help by way of Asuka pinching his cheek, introductions had been made to the poor boy and they sat down to eat.  
美里只是半心半意地听着桌上的谈话。自从真嗣醒来并再次确认自己不是在做梦后，在明日香的帮助下，通过捏他的脸颊，向可怜的男孩做了介绍，他们便坐下来吃饭。

Shikinami had kept herself distant from the whole affair. She'd answered Shinji's polite but curious questions with short responses. Her attention soon shifted to the plate of food in front of her and she chewed thoughtfully as she ate, seeming to savour every bite.  
式波一直与整个事件保持距离。她对真嗣礼貌而好奇的问题回答得很简短。她的注意力很快转移到面前的食物上，她一边吃一边若有所思地咀嚼，似乎在享受每一口。

Misato didn't blame her, the food was _great_.  
碇真嗣没有责怪她，食物真的很棒。

_Shinji's too good for us,_ she thought andhad beamed with pride as the table was set. Sure it was all Shinji's work but as his guardian she deserved some of the credit, right?  
她心想，真嗣对我们来说太好了，当餐桌布置好时，她自豪地笑了。当然，这都是真嗣的功劳，但作为他的监护人，她也应该得到一些赞誉，对吧？

_"Pen Pen? Cute name, I guess. Did you…"  
“企鹅？挺可爱的名字，我想。你是不是……”_

She looked at those sitting at the table, Soryu and Shikinami had sat opposite Shinji. Asuka had waited for Shinji to sit before taking a place next to him. Misato hadn't failed to miss _that_ little arrangement.  
她环视着桌边的众人，索玉和式波坐在真嗣对面。明日香等真嗣坐下后，才在他旁边找了个位置。美里没有错过这个小安排。

It didn't last however. Asuka had made short work of the food, dashing to her room and then into the shower as soon as she finished her plate. The girl had made no secret as to what she thought of the shower facilities at NERV and loudly declared she would bathe first.  
然而，这并没有持续多久。明日香迅速解决了食物，一吃完盘子里的东西就冲回房间，然后直奔浴室。她对 NERV 的淋浴设施毫不掩饰地表达了自己的看法，并大声宣布她要第一个洗澡。

Misato suspected the girl was simply fed up with the attention Shinji was getting.  
美里怀疑这女孩只是厌倦了真嗣受到的关注。

_Soryu did say they were close friends back in her world. I guess it's only natural she'd be more open with him.  
Soryu 确实说过他们在她的世界里是亲密的朋友。我想她对他更开放也是自然的。_

And it was true, Soryu was content to listen to the boy's answers, her whole face lit up with enthusiasm. Shinji's nervous disposition didn't dampen her spirits whatsoever, if anything it made her all the more curious.  
而且这是真的，Soryu 乐于倾听男孩的回答，她的整张脸都因热情而发光。Shinji 的紧张性格丝毫没有影响她的情绪，反而让她更加好奇。

And so it continued, now with the faint sound of the shower running in the background. Misato took a swig of her beer, enjoying the sensations as the cool beverage went down her throat.  
就这样继续着，现在背景中还隐约传来淋浴的声音。Misato 喝了一口啤酒，享受着冰凉饮料滑过喉咙的感觉。

It was only then, as she was on her third can that she remembered that she was forgetting something.  
直到那时，当她喝到第三罐饮料时，她才想起自己似乎忘了什么。

Something _important._ 某件重要的事。

_What was it?_ It _had_ been a very long week, between the long days analysing their findings on the two girls and then writing up the report for the Commander, sleep had been few and far between. _The Commander?_  
是什么呢？那一周实在太漫长了，既要长时间分析关于那两个女孩的发现，又要撰写报告给指挥官，睡眠变得稀少而遥远。指挥官？

Something clicked inside her, a piece in her forgotten puzzle. _Something to do with Shinji?_  
心中某处突然触动，遗失的拼图中似乎找到了一块。与真嗣有关吗？

Misato put down the now empty can. She automatically reached for the fourth of the night.  
美里放下已经空了的罐头，自然而然地伸手去拿今晚的第四罐。

_"Ehhh?! You also live with Misato?"  
“诶？！你也和美里住在一起吗？”_

As Soryu's words reached through the fog of exhaustion, she knew she was getting closer. She idly noted the sound of the shower had stopped.  
当绫波的话语穿透疲惫的迷雾，她知道自己越来越近了。她漫不经心地注意到淋浴的声音已经停止。

Shinji was trying his best to answer another one of Soryu's questions, giving a nervous laugh in response to something she said.  
真嗣正尽力回答绫波的另一个问题，对她的话报以紧张的笑声作为回应。

Misato gripped the can of beer and deftly opened it one handed, releasing a sharp _hiss!_ sound.  
美里紧握着啤酒罐，灵巧地单手打开，发出一声尖锐的嘶嘶声！

_Oh!_

Misato had finally remembered.  
碇真嗣终于想起来了。

Too late. 太迟了。

Before she could say or do anything Soryu's next words spilled out.  
在她能说或做任何事之前，绫波丽的下一句话已经脱口而出。

"Shinji, where's your mom and dad?"  
"真嗣，你爸爸妈妈在哪里？"

**Author Notes: 作者注：**

The 'Idiot' line was such a nice stopping point but figured it'd be better if we progressed _just a little_ further beyond.  
那句'笨蛋'确实是个不错的停顿点，但我觉得如果能稍微再推进一点会更好。

This chapter has gone through massive changes over the course of writing it, partially because I thought if I was going to write this fic then I might as well go all in and really explore the differences between the three Asukas. I don't want this to be some cheap harem type fic even though the setting is _ripe_ for it. I also hope it's much easier to follow along now that they have individual names?  
本章在撰写过程中经历了巨大的变化，部分原因在于，既然决定要写这篇同人，我便想全力以赴，深入探讨三位明日香之间的差异。我不希望这成为一部廉价的后宫类型作品，尽管背景设定为此提供了可能。同时，希望现在她们各自有了名字，故事更容易理解了？

Eva always had those moments of levity in between the serious stuff, I hope this chapter really got that across. It's unlikely I'll include all three Asuka POVs in a single chapter in future (except the epilogue) but I wanted to show where each of them are starting from. I also hope you picked up the hints as to _when_ in the NGE timeline this takes place.  
《EVA》总是在严肃剧情之间穿插轻松时刻，我希望这一章能充分传达这一点。未来不太可能在单章中包含所有三位明日香的视角（除了尾声），但我想要展示她们各自的起点。同时，希望你已经察觉到这发生在原作《新世纪福音战士》时间线中的哪个阶段。

Thank you again for reading! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.  
再次感谢你的阅读！欢迎提出建设性的批评意见。

Chapter 3: 邻家女孩
“真嗣，你爸爸妈妈在哪里？”
这个问题让餐桌上的谈话戛然而止。葛城美里惊恐地僵立着，脸上露出恐惧的表情，手臂半伸向绫波。
Soryu 本人则满怀期待地等待着，全然不知自己抛出的重磅炸弹。
真嗣的思绪一片混乱，那些他本以为已经掌控住的记忆和情感迅速涌上心头，他转过身去，避开了那双天真好奇的目光。
这是在开玩笑吗？她说的'哪里'是什么意思？她以为在哪里？
"真嗣？" 索呂问。
面对她，他再次被她与明日香相似的外貌所震撼。她甚至梳着同样的发型，他注意到她的发夹时心想。
他意识到她在等待回答，试图让自己镇定下来，手不自觉地在桌子下紧握。他艰难地咽下一口唾沫，尽力开口说话。
我不和父母住在一起。他们不在身边。
我、我...他、他们不...”
该死，他到底想说什么？母亲已经不在了，父亲也不像个父亲。你想听的就是这个吗？
环顾四周，他发现式波正盯着他。但任何从她那里得到支持的希望很快破灭了。她那张毫无表情的脸上看不出任何熟悉的迹象。他迅速移开视线，感到不安。
独自面对惣流，他试图再次开口。
我-
洗手间的门滑开了。
“美里，你不应该带我们的客人去看看他们今晚睡哪里吗？”
明日香站在门口，已经换上了她平常在公寓里的装束，肩上搭着一条毛巾。她的话让他们的监护人立刻行动起来。
"哦，对了！" 惣流合掌，几乎松了口气，"你的公寓应该准备好了。如果你吃完了，我为什么不带你参观一下呢？" 她说着，发出了一阵紧张的笑声。
她开始收拾桌边堆积的一小堆惠比寿啤酒罐，但真嗣迅速介入。
"不，不，没关系的，惣流，让我来收拾吧。"
他开始收拾空罐子和盘子。当葛城美里伸手去拿外套时，他看到她眼中的担忧，于是尽力露出一个安慰的微笑。
式波已经站了起来，只剩下惣流坐着，再次吸引了他的注意。她看起来很困惑，根据他对明日香的了解，她对这顿饭的突然结束感到有些不快。内疚感啃噬着他，他考虑着是否要再次尝试解释。
但那一刻已经过去了。
式波打破了沉默。她简短地说了声“谢谢”，并微微点了点头。她轻推了下惣流，然后转身跟随美里走出厨房。
“嗯？啊，好的，”惣流站起身来跟随式波。一个不确定的微笑浮现，她向他尴尬地挥了挥手。
“食物很美味，”对真嗣来说，这些话听起来很真诚。她似乎正要再说些什么，但明日香的一声轻咳打断了她。
真嗣敢肯定，当丽向他的室友投去一瞥后，她的笑容中闪过一丝微动，随后礼貌地鞠了一躬，跟随其他人离开，只留下真嗣和明日香在厨房里。
直到前门咔哒一声关上，明日香才朝自己的房间走去。
她甚至没有朝他这边瞥一眼。真嗣觉得她看起来很紧张。
在正常情况下，他从不怀疑明日香对事情的感受，她总是确保这一点。然而今晚，在他们所有人短暂围坐在餐桌旁的时间里，明日香没有说话，没有争论，也没有做她那种总能吸引整个房间注意的事情。
她不开心。
他对自己意识到这一点感到惊讶。明日香没有抱怨地吃了饭，但他本希望她能品尝他花了一晚上准备的晚餐，尤其是在她在 NERV 待了一周之后。然而，她匆匆吃完后就躲起来洗澡了。
他看着自己盘中的剩菜。在 Soryu 提问的间隙，他尽可能且不失礼貌地吃了几口，但她的问题一个接一个，毫不留情。
她依旧是明日香。同样的容貌，同样的声音，她捕捉他话语的速度与他所认识的明日香一样快。最奇怪的是，他很快就适应了他们的对话。
她非常友好，他想起了 Soryu 对他微笑的样子。
他试图想象明日香那样看着他的样子。
等等…不，我在想什么？他感到脸颊发热，慌乱中迅速瞥了一眼确认室友不在，然后继续收拾。
接着，他的思绪转向了两位新明日香中较为安静的那位。式波。
尽管他们几乎没说几句话，但新二总觉得好像自己做错了什么。
或许是食物让她不舒服？他漫不经心地想。
他系上围裙，将空盘子收集到水槽里准备清洗。毕竟，盘子不会自己变干净。随着呼吸逐渐平稳，新二很高兴能沉浸在洗碗这项单调的任务中，试图理清这个晚上的思绪。他拿起一个盘子开始清洗。
冲洗。涂肥皂。清洗。放置一旁。
苏龙从她的世界认识我。
冲洗。涂肥皂。清洗。放置一旁。
但我不是飞行员。明日香也不是。绫波也不是。没有 NERV。我们只是普通的孩子。
冲洗。涂肥皂。清洗。手递给明日香。
美里是学校老师！东治和健介也在那里吗？
冲洗。涂肥皂。洗手。手伸向明日香。看她擦干——
等等… "明日香？！"
他惊得叫了一声，意识到明日香正站在他旁边。他沉浸在自己的思绪和动作中，她却悄无声息地融入他身边，与他同步进行着日常。她是特意回来帮忙的吗？再仔细一看，她的头发甚至还没擦干。
他站在那里，目瞪口呆。
“盘子，”她说。
“啊？”
"盘子，" 明日香重复道，她的声音中带上了一丝危险的锋芒。
他迅速将下一个洗净的盘子递到她伸出的手中，两人又恢复了他突然中断的常规。她没有看他，专注于擦干盘子的任务。他们就这样沉默地继续了一会儿。
这种沉默只会加剧他的紧张。这不像是她。他偷偷地朝她那边瞥了几眼。现在看着她，真嗣改变了之前的看法。
她并不紧张。她只是累了。
她的眼睛，在那一撮半干未干的头发下，显得黯淡无光，失去了往日的专注。
他不敢向她提及，生怕激起她的怒火，破坏了他们之间的平静。除了偶尔她在他跟不上节奏时发出的几句抱怨或沮丧的咕哝，两人都沉默不语。
两人都乐于沉浸在一种古老而熟悉的节奏中。
他尽力集中精神，对她站得如此之近感到异常敏感。她站在他旁边时，他能感觉到她身体的温暖，尤其是当他们一起打扫时，她的手臂轻触他的手臂时，这种感觉更加强烈。他的感官充满了她散发出的清新气息。
他的思绪飞速旋转，充满了疑问。关于那个晚上，她在 Nerv 的停留，以及她对这两个其他 Asukas 的感受。
很快，洗碗工作就完成了，迅速而高效，连真嗣都感到惊讶。他转过身来想要感谢她，或许还能鼓起勇气问她一些问题。
“嘿，明日香，”他说道。她看向他，他顿时被震撼得说不出话来。
她看起来真的很疲惫，也许可以等等再说……
他咽了口唾沫，既因为他们的距离如此之近，也因为她在用那长久的、静默的目光凝视着他。如果不是她胸口微微的起伏，她几乎可以被误认为是一座雕像。
不，不是今天。
那一刻，她的眼神中似乎有什么变了，仿佛意识到他不会说什么。他本以为会像往常一样，得到她的嘲讽或尖刻的言辞，因为她觉得浪费了时间，但她却什么也没说。
明日香离开了他身边，停在即将深入公寓的位置。她没有面对他，只是微微侧过头。
“谢谢你的晚餐，”随后她便离开了。
留下感激的话语和身后淡淡的草莓洗发水香气。
嗯，我想那进展得还不错。
他环顾空荡荡的厨房，目光最终落在墙上的日历上。他回想起 Soryu 的话，心想，偏偏是这一天。
有一个特定的日期格外显眼。
他母亲去世的周年纪念日。
又一个任务。
又一次边战边退。
这次又是什么？搜寻补给？还是袭击某个 NERV 设施？
又一次试图削弱伊卡里指挥官在这片死寂地球上的庞大影响力。到现在为止已经打了多少场战斗了？她早已记不清了。这无关紧要。无论他们摆在她面前的是什么，她都会战斗到底。
这正是她存在的意义。
这就是她想要的，对吧？
她猛地向最近的无人机挥去，随着她的 Eva 武器干净利落地将其一分为二，无人机应声倒地。就像无数其他无人机一样，它在死亡时没有发出任何声音，只有骨头和金属碎裂的声响。它们不过是原版 Eva 的扭曲变种，仅此而已。
而此刻，它们正包围着她，伸手、抓挠、踢打、刺击。每一次动作都伴随着独特的噪音，而她则一一格挡、躲避并反击。在这一切以及她胸中狂跳的心声之间，她几乎错过了通讯频道中传来的信息。
"六十秒，" 她没听出是谁的声音，但意思很清楚。
他们只需要再抵挡敌人一会儿。
她感觉到有什么从后面抓住了她。她本能地扭动身体试图挣脱，并准备反击，但突然一记重击将敌人的无人机击落到地面，其头部已是一片破碎。
玛丽欢快的咆哮声穿透了一切其他声响。
哼，爱显摆。
粉色的 EVA 此刻与她并肩作战，两者背靠背如同旋涡中心的一对舞者，展开了一场精心编排、训练有素的战斗技艺展示，彰显出她们并肩作战的时光。
这并未持续太久——另一台 Eva 跳开了，而玛丽追逐着残敌，留下她独自战斗。这一切都是为了将敌人的注意力集中在她们两人身上。
她一个人能应付得来，对吧？
她确实做到了。更多的敌机在她脚下倒下，支离破碎，被弃置一旁。她比他们所有人都强。
"目标达成，执行撤离，"依旧是之前那个声音说道。
这一切并不令人惊讶。它与上一场战斗如出一辙。下一场也将如此。再下一场，以此类推。
在战斗的某个时刻，那几乎无穷无尽的增援停止了。但周围仍有其他敌人。附近的一个单位——失去了双腿——无力地试图抓住她。她一脚将其踢开。
他们必须离开。现在。
玛丽在哪里？
她环顾四周，只见零散的敌军单位——现在开始向她的位置聚拢。
玛丽已经被救出来了吗？眼镜不会丢下她不管的，这不是计划。这不应该——
她的脚踢到了什么东西，还没来得及低头查看，胸口就遭到了重重一击。她整个人翻倒在地，重重地摔在背上，发出一声闷响。短暂的意识空白后，她发现自己正仰望着夜空。天空万里无云，繁星点点。
突然间，周围陷入了一片急促的寂静。时间仿佛停止了。
有那么一刻，她忘记了立即逃跑的迫切。有那么一刻，她不在乎周围的战斗。
只有她自己。孤身一人。
就在那时，她看到了它，高高在上。在众多星光中，有一颗闪烁的光点。一颗永无止境坠落的流星。
他。
一只手臂抬起，伸向天空。一只手指上有褪色疤痕的手在空中抓握。
她惊讶地发现那是自己的手。
她在他身上看到了什么？是他的孤独吗？他们如此相似吗？这就是她当初向他伸出手的原因吗？而这些伤痕——无时无刻不在提醒着她那些笨拙且令人尴尬的人际交往尝试。
她再次望去，那光已经远去，遥不可及。
但依旧存在。
"有什么吸引了您的目光吗，公主？"
她猛然惊醒，环顾四周的黑暗房间，但那里空无一人。只是个梦，她想起来自己身在何处。我们在东京-3，在美里隔壁的公寓里。梦境的记忆已经逐渐模糊，但她明白它的含义。
家的提醒。
她低头看着自己的双手，张开又合拢。回忆着。
重新躺下，明日香·式波·兰格雷沉浸在周围的静谧黑暗中，回想起自己过去十年的生活。从一场战场辗转到另一场，短暂的休息时刻痛苦地穿插其中。这就是等待她的生活。
而现在，仿佛一场病态的玩笑，她被抛到了另一个世界。面对着另一个第三适格者。她本以为自己做好了准备。她已经让自己保持冷静，控制住怒火。
但再次看到他的脸？即便现在，她还是咬紧牙关，试图控制那些在思绪下翻涌的情绪。
不，她深吸一口气，试图放松。别在意。你不应该在意。这一切都与你无关。那不是他。那不是他。
这不是她所认识的碇真嗣。这个真嗣没有做过她认识的那个他所做的事。他没有让所有人失望。他是无辜的。
她会忍受这个世界的第三子以及他那令人难以忍受的礼貌，但她绝不会再次上当。
这不过是另一场需要克服的战斗，她能做到。她经历过更糟的。
“只是个愚蠢至极的梦，”她对自己低语。紧闭双眼，她翻了个身，决心入睡。
然后，正当她即将沉入梦乡之际，门外传来了一声轻柔的敲击。
“式波？”一个小心翼翼的声音问道。
惣流。
式波假装睡着了，希望那个女孩能把困扰她的事情留到早上。背对着门，她只能倾听。
她等待着，保持静止，不发出任何声响。
继续等待。她听到了一阵轻微的移动声。丽不会就这么离开。
重重地叹了口气，她掀开被子走向门口。轻轻推开门，发现 Soryu 站在灯光照亮的走廊里。她无视了女孩轻声的惊呼，先开口了。
“一切都好吗？”她语气生硬地说，仍然对她之前的思绪感到恼火。她立刻注意到女孩眼下的黑眼圈，语气缓和了下来。“嗯，睡得不好吗？”
“不，不是的！我以为我听到了什么声音，就，就是这样，”Soryu 一时措手不及，“我在调查，”她最终说道。
她是个糟糕的说谎者。
“对对对，”这就是式波能挤出的全部回应。
她隐约猜到这场对话会走向何方，但还是决定让它自然发展。在等待年轻女孩触及那个话题的同时，她探头望向客厅。光线昏暗，但她勉强能看到一双脚从一张凌乱的临时床下伸出来。
美里还在睡。船长选择留下来过夜——无疑是为了看护他们。
“你也没法入睡吗？”索尔尤询问道。
她本想尝试入睡，直到你打断了，她心里有些懊恼，但没有表露出来。
她打着哈欠回答，耸了耸肩。
“嗯，我...”苏龙说，对于这个模棱两可的回答犹豫不决。
但四谷——急需睡眠且耐心渐失——只能在那里站那么久。她让苏龙在门口等着，并指向自己被褥旁边的一个位置。
"欢迎你在这里睡，" 式波说着，不等回答就重新躺回床上，"如果你想的话。"
"真的吗？！" 惣流兴奋地说，随即意识到自己的失态，"我-我是说，当然，如果你坚持的话。"
式波看着惣流迅速穿过走廊回到自己的房间。不久后，她带着枕头和毯子回来了。式波没有再说什么，躺下闭上了眼睛，忽略了惣流安顿下来的声音。
房间里一片寂静。
“嘿，式波？”
“嗯？”
"可以问你件事吗？"
"你已经问了。"
"不，我的意思是...你怎么能这么冷静？我们在这里你不觉得困扰吗？我们到底是怎么来到这里的？我只记得一道强光……"
她聆听着女孩的话语——犹豫而又不确定。
"...然后，我就来到了这个陌生的城市。满是陌生人的地方。但是，还有另一个我，还有美里小姐，还有真嗣。还有你。我从未像这样远离过家，"她发出了一声空洞的笑声，"天哪，我妈妈一定担心得要命。"
她停顿了一下，深吸一口气后继续说道。
"还有真嗣。我应该道歉吗？我之前不知道他父母的事！他们只告诉了我明日香的情况，但连他也这样？天哪，为什么这里的一切都这么复杂？" 索里乌陷入了沉默。
式波不知道该说什么。无论她说什么，都无法让这个女孩感到轻松。所以她选择了沉默。
接着传来了一声轻轻的抽泣。
她转头望向苏流。
窗外的环境光足以凸显出一滴泪珠，它正缓缓滑过苏流的脸颊。
苏流没有再说什么，她意识到这个女孩对发生的事情比表面上显得更加难过。这真的那么令人惊讶吗？毕竟，苏流还只是个孩子。
或许最后一根稻草是看到她自以为熟悉的那个男孩——她的青梅竹马——将她视作陌路人。或许这终于让苏龙意识到她自己也早已明白的事实。
我们俩都不属于这里。
式波在心里暗骂，意识到自己沉浸在思绪中，竟未曾停下来考虑过他人。她意识到应该说些什么。但说什么好呢？言辞向来不是她的强项。
该死，玛丽这时候跑哪儿去了？她的这位搭档在处理这些事情上总是比她更在行。
我对此再清楚不过了。
她蜷缩在一辆临时搭建的医疗拖车里，孤身一人，静默无声。
不，并非寂静。若你仔细聆听，几乎能捕捉到环绕着她的封印柱那始终存在的嗡鸣声。
一切都没有意义。她为何还活着？怎么可能？NERV 发生了什么？绫波呢？还有真嗣呢？
美里短暂的探访并未带来帮助。
显然，自从三号机启动测试以来，时间已经流逝。一切都不对劲了。Nerv 发生了什么事，很糟糕的事。美里什么都没告诉她，只是含糊地保证她的安全，说着尴尬的安慰话。保密已经够糟了，但最终，还是她监护人脸上的表情最让她心痛。
怜悯与不信任。甚至可能还有恐惧。
因为她现在成了什么，因为现在她体内有了那个东西——一个使徒。她是个怪物。她本该死去，死亡或许更好。
真嗣本应该-
她尖叫着踢腿，当她意识到脚上的束缚将她拴在床上时，又再次尖叫起来。
新的泪水滑落。
随后，一双臂膀环抱住了她，一个声音在她耳边轻柔地呢喃，让她吃了一惊。
看来，沉睡的公主终于醒来了。
式波惊叫一声，既因为陌生声音的贴近，也因为此刻环绕她的臂膀所蕴含的力量。这力量似乎与接下来那番话的温柔语气格格不入。这是她醒来后听到的第一句真正安慰的话。
既慰藉又严苛，但最重要的是，真实。她没有力气去抗争，她累了，筋疲力尽且困惑，所以她坐下来倾听。
最终，她在那位陌生人的怀抱中哭着睡着了。
她和玛丽都从未谈及过那第一次的相遇。但那正是他们之间不安理解的开始，最终这种理解铸就了他们如今的关系。
无论那究竟是什么，她至少能承认这位神秘的女孩赢得了她的信任。
即使你不在，你还是个麻烦，她几乎带着一丝温情地想。带着这个念头，她尝试与苏龙交谈。
“嘿，”四谷轻声说道，希望不要吓到那个女孩。
没有回应。
她咽下了对那件事的恼火，再次思考要说什么才能让她明白。
“明日香，”她终于开口说道。
使用她们共同的名字引起了女孩的反应，她微微转过头来望向她。Soryu 沉默着，嘴唇紧抿成一条线，无疑是在强忍着泪水。
这种表情 Shikinami 在她年少时在镜中见过太多次了。带着一种全然陌生的紧张感，她继续说道。
“我知道你很害怕。也许我也有点。但我就站在这里，和你一起。”她用手肘撑起身体，点了点头，仿佛既是在安慰 Soryu，也是在给自己打气，她的话语有些结巴。
"我们会带你回家的，你会看到的…所以别哭了，好吗？"
她甚至向女孩露出了一个微笑。这种事情玛丽已经做过无数次了。这些话语提醒着他们，尽管世界可能已经变得糟糕透顶，但他们仍然在这里，仍然在战斗。她可能会嘲笑这有多么俗气，但玛丽会继续保持微笑。
她永远不会承认，但这是一种安慰。
随着 Soryu 继续静静地凝视，她的信心开始动摇。但随后，她又抽了抽鼻子，不确定地点了点头，露出了最微弱的笑容。
听到这个回答，式波默默地松了一口气。她决定到此为止，已经说得够多了。
好了，现在该睡觉了——
"嘿，式波？"
还有更多？！
"什么事？" 她回答道，伴随着一声明显的叹息。
"你觉得他们怎么样，我是说明日香和真嗣，他们——" 她打了个哈欠，"他们住在一起！"
她逐渐升起的恼怒随着这个问题烟消云散，这让她想起了在葛城家的日子。这正是她此刻最不想被提醒的事情，该死的惣流。
她保持沉默。尽管又打了个哈欠，惣流还是继续说着。
"当然，小时候我们也有过一起过夜的经历，但同居？在我们这个年纪？我妈妈总是说，男孩和女孩过了一定年龄就不应该住在一起了——"
真的吗？
"——而且他还会做饭！味道真是太好了——"
她说的没错，这和我记忆中的一样美好——等等，不！意识到如果不制止，这可能会持续一整晚，她打断了那个女孩。
“苏龙，”
“怎么了？”
"去睡觉吧。" 她在末尾加了个"请"字，以缓和语气。
苏龙看着她，然后出乎意料地咯咯笑了起来。式波不明白有什么好笑的。
"哎呀，" 她说，"你说话的口气真像我妈。"
随着一声轻柔而决绝的“晚安”，Soryu 翻了个身。没过多久，她就沉沉地睡着了。
式波静静地观察着，对女孩的话感到惊讶。母亲？她不知道该如何理解。突然感到非常疲惫，最后看了一眼身边的女孩，她闭上眼睛，进入了梦乡。
尽管到了早晨她不会记得，但这次她梦见的不是无休止的战斗，而是早已逝去的、更快乐的时光。
"他们非得和我们一起吃饭吗？"
"是的，明日香，别这么没礼貌。"
"可是…可是，他们现在不是有自己的公寓了吗？"
"当然，这里几乎空无一人。现在坐下来吃你的早餐吧。"
"哼！要是准备好了我当然会吃！"
这些话是针对真嗣的，但他只是半心半意地听着身后的对话，庆幸自己作为早餐主厨的角色让他忙于工作，不必参与室友的日常早晨例行公事。
至少明日香似乎恢复了往日的模样，这意味着她的胃口也将随之而来。我会在她的盘子里多放一些，这样应该能让她开心。
回想昨晚，他意识到两人间那种近乎宁静的氛围今天恐怕难以延续。今天，他惯常的“早上好”换来的却是一副皱眉，但她除此之外什么也没说。真嗣本会为此担忧，但他脑中还有其他同样令他不安的事情，而这些很可能正是困扰明日香的那两件事。
惣流和式波即将来和他们共进早餐。
惣流昨晚关于他父母的提问勾起了不快的思绪，但经过一夜的休息，他意识到这并非她的过错。
但这并没有让事情变得更容易。
该死，美里，他无力地想。他的监护人昨晚回来告诉他她要留宿，正好在他准备睡觉时逮到了他。
“对不起，真嗣，我本应该提前告诉你，但因为他们的测试、报告和处理明日香的事情，我猜我只是……”
她的道歉是发自内心的，真嗣无法继续对她生气。即便听了美里解释了绫波来自哪里，这个想法仍然让他震惊。一个父母双全的世界。他和他们在一起。一个家庭。这似乎太不真实了。
我在想，那个世界的我是否幸福呢？他皱眉面对这个显而易见的答案。他当然会幸福。
煎锅的滋滋声将他拉回了现实——鸡蛋快煎好了，突然一声“叮！”告诉他吐司也烤好了。他开始准备盘子，这时一阵突如其来的喧闹声又将他的注意力拉回到餐桌上的对话。
"购物？！" 明日香惊呼道。
"购物，" 美里微笑着说。她从夹克里掏出一张带有 NERV 标志的红色卡片，上面清晰地印着白色的"Kredit"字样，"NERV 同意承担他们的费用。所以我想我们可以把它变成一个女孩们的外出日，你觉得怎么样？我们不能总是让他们借你的衣服，所以这是最简单的解决方案。"
明日香欢呼起来，然后狡黠地瞥了美里一眼。
"钱包也轻松不少吧，对吧，美里？"
"哦，别说了，" 美里反驳道，做了个鬼脸。
真嗣开始摆放盘子，他捕捉到了明日香的表情，那是一种沉思的神情，她的目光游移到他身上。两人的目光交汇，突然间，真嗣感到脊背一阵发凉。
"Misato," Asuka 开口道，她的声音刻意保持中立，目光紧盯着他，"谁来帮我们拎所有的购物袋呢？"
糟了。
真嗣迅速转回厨房台面，开始用力擦洗一个已经很干净的盘子，比平时更加卖力，假装自己完全没有听到刚才的对话。
我不能逃跑，我不能逃跑，我不能逃跑——
恐怕我们得自己想办法了，" 美里走到他旁边，准备再泡一杯咖啡，"真嗣，你在总部有一个同步测试。别迟到了，明白吗？
真嗣松了一口气的声音清晰可闻。他回答道："是的，女士！"并尽量不让自己显得太高兴。谢谢你，美里，谢谢你，谢谢你。加持，你这个笨蛋，快娶了她吧。
明日香对美里的话皱起了眉头。
“嘿，为什么我不被测试？是我有什么问题吗？”她问道。
“嗯，我们没想到你会想驾驶除了二号机以外的任何 EVA，所以……”美里说着，双手举起以示安抚。这似乎奏效了，明日香笑了，开心地点了点头。
正当他开始摆桌子时，门铃响起，仍处于'工作'模式的真嗣开始解下围裙，没多想便去开门。
门一打开，他发现自己正面对着索龙和式波。
他愣住了。
呃…
如同初次相遇时一样，Soryu 似乎最先有了反应。
“早上好，真嗣，”她微笑着向前一步，“我们可以进来吗？”
他正要回答，昨晚她的话突然浮现在脑海中。
真嗣，你爸爸妈妈去哪儿了？
他屏住呼吸，眼睛睁得大大的。Soryu 歪着头，带着困惑的语气问道：“真嗣？”她又向前迈了一步，跨过了公寓的门槛。
真嗣，你爸爸妈妈去哪儿了？
他后退一步，双手紧紧抓住围裙边缘，仿佛那是救生衣。他痛苦地咽了咽口水，试图组织一句恰当的问候。
“请，请进，厨房里早餐已经准备好了……”他对两人说道，见他们都没有动，声音渐渐低了下去。意识到自己挡了路，他迅速转身，快步走进屋内。
他穿过厨房，对明日香和美里视而不见，径直走向自己的房间。
他靠在门上，随着门在身后关闭，他在卧室的静谧中稍作停留，整理思绪。
真嗣，你妈妈和爸爸在哪里？
苏里优现在会对他说什么？他需要和她交谈吗？她会告诉他一个他从未拥有、也不可能拥有的家庭吗？这个想法太痛苦了，难以深思。他紧闭双眼，试图控制呼吸，发现房间异常闷热。
他深吸一口气，睁开了眼睛。
他看到床上的 SDAT，现在可以离开了。
于是他便离开了。
抓起 SDAT，真嗣径直冲出了公寓，只留下含糊的话语宣告他的离去。
“喂，等等！”一个声音说道，被他突然的出现和离开吓了一跳。
那是明日香吗？还是惣流？他没有回头。
他无视了她。我不想听！无论你想说什么，他慌乱地想着，几乎在穿鞋时绊倒，直到他远远离开公寓楼，才感觉到心跳逐渐平缓。
他叹了口气，意识到这一点。
我逃跑了。
戴上耳机，他前往 NERV 总部。
即便在这里，你还是个捣蛋鬼。
这个念头一早上都在重复，但她还是将其抛诸脑后，专心检查面前的裙子。
"那么，为什么他们叫你'第二适格者'呢？"
这个问题是向站在衣架对面的明日香提出的。
她和惣流已经挑选了各种物品，并且在他们所到的每家商店里都在展示架周围转来转去。式波不禁注意到，两人都在小心翼翼地保持一定的距离，仿佛要避免给人留下他们对衣服有相同兴趣的印象。
看来她终于不再闹别扭了，真希波心想。明日香整个上午大部分时间都沉默不语，显然是被碇真嗣的行为分了心。或许也对自己无所作为感到烦恼。
你并没有做错什么。他只会让你失望。
真希波将这个念头藏在心底，决定让那女孩自己琢磨去。现在看来，明日香那无穷无尽的好奇心终于回来了。不幸的是，阿苏卡成了她的第一个目标。
明日香转向索琉，不清楚她到底是什么意思。
"什么？"
索琉正在翻看一排夏季短裤，对那警惕的语气不为所动。
我是说，为什么是'第二个'孩子？为什么不是'第一个'？" 她转过身，向明日香投去一个狡黠的微笑，"难道你只配得第二名吗？
明日香和式波都眨了眨眼。所以她认为我们的驾驶员代号是等级排名？
“那…那不是…”明日香开口又停下，一时语塞，措手不及。但她听出了其中的含义——这是对她驾驶技术的批评。
式波默默地看着明日香的脸开始泛红，双手紧握成拳。她心想，最好在情况恶化之前介入，于是她走近一步，将手放在了惣流肩上。
"这不是排位。只是我们获得驾驶员资格的顺序而已，" 她温和地解释道，"第二适格者意味着我们是第二批被指定为 Eva 驾驶员的人。"
"你是说没有竞争？" 惣流有些泄气，"真没劲。"
明日香瞥了式波一眼，那眼神仿佛在说'我不需要你的帮助'，但随即平息了下来。
"当然这不是比赛，大家都知道我是最棒的飞行员，"明日香终于说道。
"哦？那你是比真嗣强咯？" 索琉问道。
"噗！那个笨蛋？我当然比他强，" 明日香自豪地笑着。
Soryu 思索了一会儿答案，然后对自己点了点头。
"我想那确实有道理。任何拥有我这样才华的人，做任何事都会很出色。"
"你的才华？！我觉得你搞反了吧，"Asuka 嗤之以鼻，"你又知道什么？你不过是个小学生罢了。"
我该说点什么吗？真嗣内心纠结着，一方面想要阻止这场争吵，另一方面却又莫名地被旁观两人的场面所吸引。
“哼，你也是一样！”丽直起身子，带着怒气反驳道。
“啊，”明日香回以一抹嘲讽的微笑，“但这就是你错了，小小姐丽。我早就已经大学毕业了。”
这话让 Soryu 的反驳戛然而止，连 Shikinami 也默默地消化着这一信息。真的吗？在她这个年纪？
“真的吗？！”Soryu 终于开口道。
Asuka 只是微微一笑。
"对，我去年就毕业了。不信问美里，" 她对他们的怀疑耸了耸肩，"我之所以还在学校，是因为 Nerv 说我必须得去。"
惣流转向式波，几乎是恳求般地说道。
"别告诉我你也大学毕业了？！"
式波在内心叹了口气，她注意到明日香正用一种未及眼底的微笑看着她。没有撒谎的必要。
“不，我从没去过，”她愉快地回答索琉，后者因为找到了与自己水平相当的人而高兴地点了点头。
但接下来，式波是和明日香交谈的。
"我首先是 Eva 的驾驶员，" 她自己的笑容变得冰冷，"我不会屈居第二。"
听到这些话，明日香的眼睛眯了起来，但没有回应。哼，我赢了，不是吗？
"好吧，我们中有一个拥有 Eva，而那个人不是你，" 明日香最终说道，"下次战斗你就会见识到我有多厉害。"
"哦？你这么认为吗？"
"没错。我生来就是要驾驶 Eva 的，"明日香说着，双臂交叉，几乎是在挑衅式地等待式波进一步反应。她思索着明日香的话，生来就要驾驶 Eva？你根本不懂。
两人对视了一会儿，谁也不愿意先退让或移开视线。式波在想，她原本期待从这个女孩身上得到什么呢？
你和他一样糟糕。
与此同时，苏龙用略带忧虑的眼神来回看着两人。
“或许我应该挑选一些稍冷时穿的衣服？哦，美里！”苏龙向走近的美里挥手，随即离开，留下两人站在那里。
她的话语打破了紧张气氛，式波眨了眨眼
我这是在做什么？
跟小孩子打架？挑衅明日香？难道仅仅是因为自尊心吗？
还是说，是别的原因？明日香的话语和行为中，有什么诡异地相似，让她想起了——不，她立刻掐断了这念头，不喜欢这种走向。不，我不该介入。
她转过身，不再看向另一个女孩。
她没料到明日香会悄悄靠过来。现在又怎样？她的心跳因肾上腺素的激增而加速，不由自主地做好了战斗准备。
她本不必担心的。
明日香故意用挑剔的眼光审视着她手中的裙子。
哇，有人和美里一样的时尚品味，呸！你自己留着吧，"她伸手过去，有点过于靠近，挑选了一件衬衫和短裤的搭配
"这样不是更好吗？" 明日香问道，举起手中的物品。她甜甜地笑了。
式波知道这其实与衣服无关，但她已经没有心情争吵了。
"我想还不错吧，" 她叹了口气说道。
明日香若有所思地哼了一声，对这回应感到满意。随后她便独自继续浏览。真希波看着她离去，只能无奈地摇了摇头。
明日香·兰格雷·索西尔——EVA 驾驶员——无论那女孩有什么问题，都不是她的问题。
她会选择沉默等待。直到离开这个世界。
她当然不怕明日香。但美里呢？NERV 呢？如果他们认为她在惹麻烦，那情况可能会变得更糟。她可不想再回到被锁的房间里。
现在，惣流去哪儿了？
式波回头一看，发现惣流已经不在那里了。她迅速环顾四周，看到那个女孩正蹦蹦跳跳地和美里一起走向最近的更衣室，两人手里都拿着五颜六色的衣服。显然，她们对刚才的小插曲一无所知。
这个女孩…
她摇了摇头，走向自己那堆小得多的物品，思索是否还需要其他东西。想起手中的裙子，她仔细审视了一番，但最终还是放了回去。
不，这裙子对她来说太短了，但是…
"...玛丽会喜欢的。"
听到这话，明日香差点转过头去。那个奇怪的真希波女孩似乎没意识到自己把话说出了声。
明日香思索了片刻。
玛丽？我之前在哪里听过这个名字？
哦，这真是太满足了！我再去拿点儿！
碇真嗣从桌边起身，再次排队等候在甜品柜台前。他们偶然发现的这家小咖啡馆出奇地安静，与外面喧嚣的人群形成了愉快的对比。
式波看着明日香一言不发地跟随她的监护人离去。
她低头看着面前的空碗，肚子因眼前的景象而咕咕作响。她还是饿吗？她悄悄环顾餐桌，发现惣流正开心地大口吃着她的冰淇淋圣代。
这胃口是怎么回事？
她叹了口气，用力吸着饮料的吸管来分散注意力。或许回到公寓后可以抓点零食吃。又或许……
他今晚还会做饭吗？
她不喜欢自己一想到这个就流口水的感觉。
她靠回椅背，手中端着饮料，试图享受周围的宁静，希望自己能像苏龙一样感到满足。
两人都很高兴能歇歇脚。美里带领着大家从一个时尚店铺逛到另一个，仿佛任务般要逛遍东京-3 中心的所有服装店。
大约下午过半时，美里提议休息一下。女孩们欣然同意，于是他们来到了这里，显然是明日香喜欢的地方。他们坐下，旁边是他们买的一小堆东西。
式波深深地呼出一口气，等待着这一天结束。人群从来不是她所喜欢的。
她望向他们座位旁的大窗户，看着形形色色的人们忙着自己的一天。
有上班族、家庭、情侣、学龄儿童、青少年和老年人。这是一个晴朗无云的日子，街道上熙熙攘攘，周末的欢快声环绕四周。即使在堡垒城市的中心，生活依旧继续着。
它永远不会停止让我惊讶...
“不饿吗？”
式波转过身，发现惣流正好奇地盯着她。
"不，"她撒谎道，摇了摇头，然后转回身望向窗外，与其说是为了别的，不如说是为了避开苏龙的目光。
她回想起昨晚的对话。那女孩的坦诚出乎意料，或许对她自己也是如此。思索着如何最好地回答苏龙，她意识到向她敞开心扉并无害处。
就一点点。
"我想我还不太习惯这种关注。"
这三个明日香无论走到哪里都引人注目。她们绝不是那种不起眼的人。
"就是啊，好像人们从没见过三胞胎似的，" 惣流说，她的声音随着转身向身后投去一道阴沉的目光而提高。
随着一阵像是有人噎住食物的声音和椅子快速挪动的响动，她看到一位年长的男士匆忙离开了店铺——手里还拿着半个未吃完的可丽饼。他们看着他走过他们坐着的窗前，注意到他们共同的怒视仍然紧盯着他。随着一声小小的惊叫，他加快了脚步，差点在踏入人群时将食物洒落。
Soryu 大笑着咬了一口她的圣代，带着"哼，活该！"的语气，而 Shikinami 也不禁回以微笑。
“我很高兴我们脱掉了那些制服，”Soryu 说道。
式波点头表示同意。
她伸手去拉扯现在穿着的卫衣上的流苏，但忍住了将帽子拉过头顶的冲动。搭配宽松的裤子，她的着装虽然简单，却十分舒适，非常适合夏天的气候。
这与绫波和明日香的装扮形成了鲜明对比，她们的穿着明显比她更女性化。
"我在想真嗣会怎么想。"
听到这话，式波扬了扬眉毛，看着惣流欣赏她的新装束。但她们的话还没来得及继续，就被打断了。
"你干嘛在乎那个笨蛋怎么想？"
明日香回来了，和美里一起，两人手里都拿着一小块蛋糕。明日香的蛋糕是巧克力味的，上面点缀着切片草莓，还淋了更多的巧克力酱。式波移开了视线。
“哎，他今天早上甚至都不跟我说话。还有昨晚……”惣流欲言又止。
“天哪，你还纠结那事儿呢？”明日香翻了个白眼。她坐下来，舀了一大勺蛋糕送进嘴里，然后继续说道。
"真嗣一直有点古怪。你们俩突然出现，可能把他可怜的脑袋都搞糊涂了！"
"不用担心真嗣。他会想通的，等着瞧吧，" 美里说着，喝了一口咖啡。
"既然你这么说，" 索里乌说道。
葛城美里对着女孩咧嘴一笑。
虽然你这么关心他还挺可爱的。有什么想分享的吗？" 这句话伴随着一个心照不宣的眼神。
惣流脸红了。
式波忍不住翻了个白眼。
明日香看起来一脸厌恶。
太好了，我们正需要——让第三个人来照顾他，"她用尖锐的眼神看了看美里。美里耸了耸肩。明日香转回对绫波说道。
"我还是不敢相信你和他竟然是朋友。"
"为什么不行？" 苏龙说，现在轮到他显得愤愤不平了。
"我本以为我的对手会有更好的品味，" 明日香夸张地叹了口气，"是我期望过高了。"
"他没什么问题。"
"你说的。"
"我就是这么认为的。你不如我了解他，"
"哎呀，别说得那么恶心，" 明日香说着，推开椅子，一脸惊愕。美里笑了起来。
式波任由对话在耳边飘过，不想卷入两人的争吵，而美里则尽力为缺席的真嗣·伊卡里辩护。
"你知道的，明日香，你可以对他更友好一些。"
"我对他挺好的，他能和我们住在一起算是走运了。"
"真嗣比你先来，明日香。"
"细节，细节。"
"别忘了他还把你从那座火山中救了出来，"
式波愣住了。什么？
"我也回报了他，我们现在扯平了！"
"火山？" 苏龙说道。
"嗯，我不能说太多，因为，你知道的，机密……"
Misato 倾身向前，开始用低沉的声音说话。
式波微微侧头，以便听得更清楚。可能只是错觉。
但她还是继续听着。
"明日香驾驶着二号机，差点就完了。她正坠入浅间山火山口，越陷越深。但真嗣，驾驶着他的 EVA，未经保护就跳了进去救她。那小子甚至没等命令。" 她靠在椅背上，若有所思地点点头，啜了一口咖啡。
"把他狠狠训了一顿，因为他搞了那么一出，嘿，"她补充道。
桌子周围一片沉默，大家都在消化这个消息。
"哇，"是苏龙唯一能发出的声音，她的眼睛闪烁着惊奇的光芒。
"哼，我可是打败了天使，你总是漏掉这一点，"明日香说道。
"看来连你的真嗣也有优点嘛！来吧，这点你总得承认，"绫波丽用胳膊肘轻轻碰了碰明日香，语气中带着一丝得意，仿佛局势已经逆转。
明日香不悦地瞪了那女孩一眼，随后叹了口气，认输了。
"我从没说过他不是，"她小声说道，"而且他不是'我的真嗣'，他就是个笨蛋，"明日香补充道。但她的语气中并无恶意，她避开绫波的狡黠目光，表情若有所思。
沉默被美里手机铃声打破，简短交谈几句后，这位年长女性站起身，表情严肃。
"NERV 那边出了问题，我们得过去，"说完，她转身就走。明日香和绫波也紧随其后，开始收拾自己的背包。
式波坐在那里，一动不动，耳边回响着美里的话。
“他…救了她？”她自言自语地低声说道。
她缓缓转头，看着明日香走出去。听着她向美里抱怨购物之旅被缩短。看着那女孩继续她的生活。
始终感受到那股缓慢涌动的怒气在沸腾。她伸手抓起自己的包，径直走出了门，动作几乎是下意识的。
思考中。
这里发生的事情比她意识到的要不同得多。
不，我不在乎。
她看着，只能好奇是什么让她如此与众不同。
我不在乎。
这与我无关。
我一点也不在乎。
她脑海中浮现出她所认识的碇真嗣的形象。
为什么他救不了我？
那天晚上晚些时候，明日香正在和光通电话，补上了一周的新闻和八卦。她们交谈时，她的目光扫过卧室里散落的新衣服。考虑到所有情况，这次收获还不错。
她瞥了一眼对面自己的房间，那是真嗣的房间。男孩因为尝试激活零号机而留在 NERV 进行观察。她想起了当美里传达这个消息时，惣流脸上的担忧，真是的，第三适格者最不需要的就是一个粉丝为他忧心忡忡。
或许她太过苛刻了？她不能忽视他为她准备的餐食，即使另外两个明日香的出现对他来说是个意外的惊喜。说到这个……
式波。那女孩想要保持神秘，她觉得无所谓。但她提到的名字——真希波——明日香确信自己曾在哪里听过。这激起了她的好奇心。可能最终什么也不是，但她不找到答案就放不下。她本来就打算给光打电话，所以她等待着，像往常一样，光礼貌而常规的回应如期而至。
“我真的没事，赤木博士只是想做一些测试。你知道医院就是这样的……”她故意留下话头，希望那女孩会接下去。
她等待着。
宾果！
“那个运动员？”
她用最装作毫不好奇的语气，问出了她一直想问的问题。
哦，他有个妹妹？她叫什么名字来着？

非常感谢过去一年中自chapter 2 以来所有留下评论的朋友们！特别是那些无法直接回复的匿名评论者（为了更方便回复，注册一个账号绝对是值得的！）。
chapter的延迟部分是因为生活琐事，部分是因为真正意识到让不想交谈的角色对话有多难而完全卡住了。
关于 Shiki 和 Mari 的闪回，我不认为原作中有提及他们初次相遇的情节。但我很喜欢他们之间的斗嘴和彼此间的舒适感，这是我想要稍微探索的。希望 Shinji 对与 Soryu 交谈的犹豫能显得真实，我无法想象他会愿意在如此敏感的话题上喝茶聊天。这个chapter包含了所有我想要的元素，对此我非常满意。
对于Chapter第 4 章，我不做承诺，但我希望它不会像第 2 章和第 3 章之间的间隔那么长。甚至可能会写一两篇短篇来保持新鲜感。
感谢您的阅读和评论。我总是很高兴看到大家的想法，这总是令人感激的。欢迎提出意见和建议！

"Shinji, where's your mom and dad?"

The question brought the conversation at the table to a standstill. Misato stood frozen with a look of horror on her face, her arm half reaching out to Soryu.

Soryu herself waited expectantly, oblivious to the bombshell she had dropped.

Shinji's thought process was in a jumble, memories and feelings he had thought under control quickly came to the forefront of his mind and he turned away from the innocently inquisitive look directed at him.

_Is this a joke? What does she mean 'where?' Where does she think?_

"Shinji?" asked Soryu.

Facing her, he was again struck by the resemblance to Asuka. _She even wears her hair the same,_ he thought as he noticed her hair clips.

He realised she was waiting for an answer and tried to steady himself, hand reflexively clenching under the table. Swallowing a hard lump in his throat he tried his best to speak.

_I don't live with my parents. They're not around._

"I d-don't, I-… t-they're not…"

Dammit, what was he trying to say? _Mother's gone and father isn't much of one. Is that what you want to hear?_

Looking around he found Shikinami staring at him. But any hope of support from her was soon dashed. There was nothing recognisable in the blank face she showed. He quickly broke eye contact, unnerved.

Facing Soryu alone, he attempted to speak again.

"My-"

The wash room door slid open.

"Misato, shouldn't you be showing our _guests_ where they'll be sleeping tonight?"

Asuka stood in the doorway and now changed into her usual apartment attire, sporting a towel on her shoulders. Her words jolted their guardian into action.

"Oh, that's right!" Misato clasped her hands together, almost in relief, "Your apartment should be ready. If you're done eating, why don't I give you a tour?" she said and let out a nervous laugh.

She began to pick up the small collection of Yebisu cans amassed on her side of the table but Shinji quickly intervened.

"N-no, it's okay Misato, let me get those."

He began clearing away the empty cans and dishes. Misato paused as she went to grab her jacket and he saw the worry reflected in her eyes, he tried his best to give a reassuring smile.

Shikinami had stood up, leaving just Soryu sitting and she drew his attention once more. She looked confused and from what he knew of Asuka, a little upset at the quick end to their meal. Guilt gnawed at him and he considered trying to explain a second time.

But the moment had passed.

Shikinami broke the silence. She gave a terse _"Thanks,"_ and the briefest of nods. She nudged Soryu before turning to follow Misato out the kitchen.

"Huh? Ah, yeah," Soryu stood up to follow Shikinami. An unsure smile appeared and she gave him an awkward wave.

"The food was delicious," to Shinji the words sounded earnest. She looked as if she was about to say more but a quiet cough from Asuka put a stop to that.

Shinji could've sworn there was the slightest twitch in Soryu's smile as she shot _a look_ towards his room-mate before giving him a polite bow and following the others, leaving just Shinji and Asuka in the kitchen.

Only with the sound of the front door sliding shut did Asuka head for her room.

She didn't so much as glance in his direction. Shinji thought she looked tense.

Under normal circumstances, he was never left in doubt as to how Asuka felt about things, she'd make sure of that. Tonight however, during brief time they had all sat at the table, Asuka hadn't spoken, or argued or did that _thing_ of hers that would somehow capture the attention of the entire room.

_She's not happy._

He surprised himself with the realisation. Asuka had eaten without complaint but he had hoped she could've savoured the meal he had spent the evening preparing, especially after her week-long stay at Nerv. Instead it had been rushed before she squirrelled herself away to take a shower.

He looked at the leftovers on his own plate. He had taken bites in between Soryu's questions when he could and when politeness allowed but she had been relentless.

_She's still Asuka though_. The same looks, the same voice and she was just as quick to pick up on his words as the Asuka he knew. The strangest thing was how easily he settled into their conversation.

_She's very friendly,_ he thought, remembering how Soryu had smiled at him.

He tried to picture Asuka looking at him like that.

_Wait… no, what am I thinking?_ Flustered and feeling the warmth in his face, he took a swift glance confirm his room-mate's absence before resuming cleaning up.

His thoughts then turned to the quieter of the two new Asukas. _Shikinami_.

Though they had hardly spoken a word, Shinji couldn't shake the impression he had done something wrong.

_Maybe the food upset her?_ He thought idly.

He put on his apron and gathered the empty dishes into the sink to clean. After all, the plates weren't going to clean themselves. His breathing settling into a calm rhythm, Shinji was happy to lose himself in the monotonous task of washing up as he tried to make sense of the evening. He picked a plate and started to clean.

Rinse. Soap. Wash. Set aside.

_Soryu knows me from her world._

Rinse. Soap. Wash. Set aside.

_But I'm not a pilot. And neither is Asuka. Or Rei. There's no NERV. We're just normal kids._

Rinse. Soap. Wash. Hand to Asuka.

_Misato's a school teacher! Are Toji and Kensuke there too?_

Rinse. Soap. Wash. Hand to Asuka. Watch her dry-

_Wait…_ "A-Asuka?!"

Startled, he gave a yelp as he realised Asuka was standing beside him. Lost in his thoughts and movements on automatic, she had seamlessly inserted herself alongside him, matching his routine. _Did she come back just to help?_ And looking a little closer, _she hasn't even dried her hair._

He stood, dumbstruck.

"Plate," she said.

"Huh?"

"_Plate,"_ Asuka repeated, her voice gaining a dangerous edge.

He quickly pressed the next cleaned plate into her outstretched hand and they resumed the routine he had abruptly stopped. She didn't look at him, keeping her focus on the task of drying the dishes. They continued in silence for some time.

A silence which did nothing but increase his nervousness. _This isn't like her_. He made a few discreet glances in her direction. Looking at her now, Shinji changed his earlier assessment.

She wasn't tense. She was _tired._

Her eyes, beneath the odd stand of not-quite-dry hair, were dull and lacked their usual attentiveness.

He didn't dare mention it to her for fear of rousing her anger and losing the peace between them. Aside from the odd word or grunt of frustration from her whenever he lost pace, neither spoke.

Both content to fall into an old, familiar rhythm.

He tried his best to concentrate, feeling incredibly conscious of her standing so close. He could feel the warmth of her body as she stood next to him, even more so whenever her arm brushed his as they cleaned together. His senses were filled with the freshness radiating off of her.

His thoughts raced with questions. About the evening, her stay at Nerv, how she felt about these two other Asukas.

Soon the washing up was done, quickly and efficiently to a degree that impressed even Shinji and he turned to thank her and maybe even gather the courage to ask her some questions.

"Hey Asuka," he said. She looked at him and he was at once stunned into silence.

_She really does look tired, maybe_ _it can wait..._

He gulped, at both their proximity and the long, quiet stare she was giving him and were it not for the soft fall and rise of her chest, she could've been mistaken for a statue.

_No, not today._

Something changed in her eyes then, as if realising he wasn't going to say anything. He expected the usual insult or barb for wasting her time but she said nothing.

Asuka left his side, stopping just short of going further into the apartment. She didn't face him, just a slight turn off her head.

"Thanks for dinner," and then she was gone.

Leaving the words of gratitude and the faint aroma of strawberry shampoo in her wake.

_Well I guess that went well._

He looked around the empty kitchen until his eyes fell on the calendar on the wall. He thought about Soryu's words and thought, _Of all the days._

One particular date stood out.

The anniversary of his mother's death.

---

_Another mission._

_Another fighting retreat._

_What was it this time? Scavenging for supplies? An attack on some Nerv facility?_

_One more attempt to chip away at Commander Ikari's monolithic reach across the dead Earth. How many battles had it been now? She had long since lost count. It didn't matter. She would fight whatever they put in front of her._

_This is what she was for._

_This is what she wanted, right?_

_She swung down hard at the nearest drone; it collapsed as her Eva's weapon sliced it cleanly in two. Just like countless others, it released no sound as it died. Just the crunch of bone and metal. They were just tools. Nothing more than bastardised variants of the original Evas._

_And currently they surrounded her; reaching, clawing, kicking and stabbing. Each action with its own distinct cacophony of noise as she blocked, evaded and attacked in turn. Between all that and the sound of her heart pounding in her chest, she almost missed the communication filtering through comms._

_"Sixty seconds," she didn't recognise the voice but the meaning was clear enough._

_They needed to hold off the enemy for just a little longer._

_She felt something grab her from behind. She instinctively twisted to pull herself away and readied to attack but suddenly a hard blow sent the enemy drone to the earth, it's head now a broken mess._

_The sound of Mari's joyous growl cut through everything else._

_Hmph, show-off._

_The pink Eva now at her side, they both fought back to back like a pair of dancers in the centre of a maelstrom of metal. A choreographed and well honed display of fighting prowess that spoke of their time fighting alongside each other._

_It didn't last - the other Eva jumped away, as Mari chased after stragglers, leaving her to fight alone. All to keep the enemy's collective attention on the two of them._

_She could handle it on her own, right?_

_And she did. More enemy units fell at her feet. Broken. Discarded. She was better than all of them._

"_Objective achieved, execute escape," said the same voice as earlier._

_There was nothing surprising about all this. It had played out in the same manner as the last battle. The next one would be the same. And the one after that, on and on._

_At some point during the fight, the almost endless stream of reinforcements had stopped. But there were still others around her. A unit nearby - missing both its legs - feebly attempted to latch onto her own. She kicked it away._

_They had to leave. Now._

_Where was Mari?_

_She looked around and saw nothing but disparate enemy units around her - now beginning to converge on her position._

_Had Mari extracted already? Glasses wouldn't have left her alone, that wasn't the plan. That's not-_

_Her foot struck something and before she could look down, something hit her hard in the chest. She barrelled over, falling and landed on her back with a thud. Blanking out for a split second she found herself facing the night sky. It was cloudless and full of stars._

_There was a sudden rushing silence. Time seemed to stop._

_For a moment, she forgot the immediate need to run. For a moment, she didn't care about the battle around her._

_It was just her. Alone._

_And that's when she saw it, far above her. A single, twinkling light amongst all the others. An endlessly falling star._

_Him._

_An arm raised itself up, reaching into the sky. A hand with faded scars on its fingers grasped at the air._

_She was surprised to find it was her own._

_What had she seen in him? His loneliness? Were they so similar? Was that why she reached towards him, back then? And these scars - an ever present reminder of her clumsy and embarrassing attempts at a human connection._

_She looked again, the light was far away now. Out of reach._

_But still there._

"Something catch your eye, Princess?"

She woke up with a start and glanced around the dark room but there was no one there. _Just a dream,_ she thought remembering where she was. _We're in Tokyo-3. In the apartment next to Misato's._ The dream was already fading from recollection but she knew what it meant.

A reminder of home.

She looked down at her hands, opening and closing them. Remembering.

Lying back down, Asuka Shikinami Langley took in the quiet darkness around her and recalled what the last decade of her life amounted to. The routine of going from one battlefield to the next punctuated by painfully short moments of respite. That was the life that was waiting for her.

And now, like some sick joke, she had been tossed here in some other world. Face to face with another Third Child. She had thought herself prepared. She had steeled herself to keep calm, to keep her anger in check.

But seeing his face again? Even now she grit her teeth, trying to control the emotions swimming beneath her thoughts.

_No,_ she took a deep breath, trying to relax. _Don't care. You shouldn't care. None of this has anything to do with you. It's not him. It's not him._

This wasn't the Shinji Ikari she had known. This Shinji hadn't done the things hers had. He hadn't failed everyone. He was innocent.

She would put up with the Third Child of this world and that insufferable politeness of his but she wouldn't fall for it a second time.

This was just another battle to get through, she could do that. She had survived worse.

"Just a stupid, _stupid_ dream," she whispered to herself. Screwing her eyes shut, she turned over and resolved to get some sleep.

And then, just as she was settling into slumber, there was a quiet tap at the door.

"Shikinami?" said a furtive voice.

_Soryu._

Shikinami pretended to sleep, hoping the girl would leave whatever was bothering her until the morning. With her back to the door, she could only listen.

She waited, keeping still and not making a sound.

And waited. She heard a shuffle of movement. Soryu wasn't going away.

With a heavy sigh pulled the covers off and went to the door. Sliding it open to find Soryu in the lit hallway. She ignored the girl's soft cry of surprise and spoke first.

"Everything okay?" She said tersely, still annoyed by her earlier thoughts. She immediately noticed the bags under the girl's eyes and softened her tone. "Hmm, trouble sleeping?"

"N-no! I thought I heard a noise, t-that's all," Soryu said, caught off guard momentarily, "I was investigating," she finally said.

_She's a terrible liar._

"_Riiight_," was all the response Shikinami could muster.

She had a sneaking suspicion as to where this conversation was heading but figured she should let it run its course. Whilst she waited for the younger girl to reach that point, she poked her head out towards the living room. It was dimly lit but she could just barely make out two feet sticking out from beneath a messy, makeshift bed.

_Misato's still asleep._ The captain had elected to stay the night - no doubt to watch over them.

"So, you can't sleep either?" Soryu inquired.

_I was trying to until you interrupted,_ she thought with a little frustration but kept it to herself.

She replied with a yawn and gave a shrug.

"Well, I uh…" Soryu said, hesitating at the non-committal answer.

But Shikinami - in need of sleep and with patience running thin - could only stand there for so long. She left Soryu waiting by the door and pointed to a spot next to where her own futon lay.

"You're welcome to sleep here," said Shikinami, getting back into bed without waiting for an answer, "if you want."

"Really?!" Soryu said excitedly before catching herself, "I-I mean sure, if you insist."

Shikinami watched as Soryu made a swift exit back across the hallway. She returned a moment later, pillow and blankets in hand. Shikinami didn't say anything further as she lay down and closed her eyes, ignoring the sound of Soryu settling in.

Silence filled the room.

"Hey, Shikinami?"

"Hmm?"

"Can I ask you something?"

"You just did."

"N-no what I mean is... how can you be so calm? Doesn't it bother you, that we're here at all? How did we even get here? All I remember is a bright light…"

She listened to the girl's words - hesitant and unsure.

"... and then, I'm here in this strange city. Full of people I don't know. But t-then there's this other me and Miss Misato, and Shinji. And _you_. I've _never_ been away from home like this before," she let out a hollow laugh, "_geez_, my mother must be worried like hell."

She paused to take a breath before continuing.

"And Shinji. Should I apologise? I didn't know about his parents! They told me about Asuka but _him_ too? _God_, why does everything have to be so complicated here?" Soryu drifted off into silence.

Shikinami didn't know what to say. Nothing she could say would make it easier for the girl. So she didn't say anything.

Then there was a soft sniffle.

She turned her head towards Soryu.

The ambient light from the window was enough to highlight the trail of a single tear as it made its way down Soryu's cheek.

Soryu didn't say anything further and she realised the girl was more upset with events than she had let on. Was that really so surprising? Soryu was, after all, still just a child.

Maybe the final straw was seeing the boy she thought she knew - her childhood friend - treat her like a stranger. Maybe it had finally made Soryu realise the same thing she herself had.

_Neither of us belong here._

Shikinami cursed silently, realising she had been so wrapped up in her own thoughts, she hadn't stopped to consider anyone else. She realised she should say something. But what? Words were never her forte.

_Dammit, where's Mari when you need her?_ Her fellow pilot had always been better at this stuff than she was.

_I know that all too well._

---

_She sat huddled within the confines of a hastily prepared med trailer. Alone and in silence._

_No, not silence. If you listened carefully, you could just about make out the ever present hum of the sealing pillars surrounding her._

_Nothing made sense. Why was she even alive? How? What happened to Nerv? To Rei? And Shinji?_

_Misato's short visit had not helped._

_It was obvious time had passed since the Unit-03 activation test. It had all gone wrong. Something had happened at Nerv. Something bad. Misato hadn't told her anything at all, just vague reassurances of her safety and awkward words of comfort. The secrecy was bad enough but in the end it was the look on her guardian's face that hurt most of all._

_Pity and distrust. Maybe even fear._

_For what she now was, for the thing now inside her - an angel. She was a freak. She should've died, death would've been better._

_Shinji should've-_

_She screamed and kicked out. And screamed some more as she was reminded of the restraint on her foot, chaining her to the bed._

_Fresh tears fell._

_And then a pair of arms wrapped themselves around her and a voice cooed in her ear, surprising her._

_"So the sleeping princess is awake at last."_

_Shikinami gave a cry, both at the proximity of the stranger's voice and the strength in the arms now around her._ _A strength seemingly at odds with the words that followed. The first words of any real comfort since she had awoken._

_Comforting… and harsh in equal measure but above all, honest. She didn't have the strength to fight, she was tired, exhausted and confused, so she sat and listened._

_In the end she cried herself to sleep, cradled in the arms of the stranger._

---

Neither she nor Mari had ever spoken about that first meeting. But it had been the start of an uneasy understanding between them which eventually forged itself into their relationship as it stood today.

Whatever it was exactly, she could at least admit the enigmatic girl had won over her trust.

_You're still a pain even when you're not here_, she thought almost fondly. And with that thought she made an attempt at speaking with Soryu.

"Hey," Shikinami said softly, hoping not to spook the girl.

No response.

She swallowed her annoyance at that and thought again as to what to say to get through to her.

"Asuka," she finally said.

The use of their shared name got a reaction from the girl, who turned her head just enough to look back at her. Soryu stayed silent, her mouth a thin line and no doubt holding back further tears.

It was a look Shikinami had seen in the mirror far too often in her younger days. With an entirely unfamiliar sense of nervousness, she continued.

"I know you're scared. And maybe I am too. A little. But I'm right here. With you." She propped herself on her elbows and nodded, almost to reassure herself as much as Soryu, as she fumbled through her words.

"We'll get you home, you'll see… so don't cry, okay?"

She even finished with a grin towards the girl. It was the sort of thing Mari had done countless times. Words that reminded them that though the world may have gone to hell, they were still here, still fighting. She would scoff at how corny it was but Mari would keep on smiling.

She would never admit it, but it was a comfort.

Her confidence started to falter as Soryu continued her quiet stare. But then with another sniffle and an uncertain nod, she showed the faintest of smiles.

Shikinami silently breathed a sigh of relief at the response. She decided to leave it at that, enough had been said.

_Okay, now time to sleep-_

"Hey Shikinami?"

_There's more?!_

"Yes?" She said, punctuated audibly with a sigh.

"What do you think about them, I mean Asuka and Shinji, they-" she yawned, "_they_ _live_ _together!_"

Her growing annoyance evaporated as the question brought back memories of her time at the Katsuragi apartment. This was the last thing she wanted to be reminded of right now, _damn you Soryu._

She remained silent. Despite another yawn escaping her, Soryu kept talking.

"Sure, even I've had _sleepovers_ with him when we were little, but staying together? At our age? My mother always said a boy and a girl shouldn't live together over the age of-"

_Really now?_

"- and he cooks too! It was _so_ tasty-"

_She's right, it_ was _as good as I remembered it - wait, no!_ Realising this could go on all night if she didn't put a stop to it, she interrupted the girl.

"Soryu,"

"Yes?"

"Go. To. Sleep." She added a "_please,_" at the end to soften her words.

Soryu looked at her and then, unexpectedly, giggled. Shikinami wondered what was so funny.

"_Geez_, " she said, "you sound like my mother."

And with a quiet and final "_goodnight_," Soryu turned over. It didn't take long before she was sound asleep.

Shikinami watched quietly, surprised by the girl's words. _A mother?_ She didn't know what to make of that. Suddenly feeling very tired and with one last look towards the girl beside her, she closed her eyes and slept.

And though she wouldn't remember come the morning, this time she dreamt not of endless battle, but of long gone, happier times.

---

"Do they _have_ to eat with us?"

"Yes, Asuka, don't be rude."

"But…but, they've got their own apartment now don't they?"

"Sure, and it's practically empty. Now sit down and eat your breakfast."

"Hmph! I would if it was ready!"

These last words aimed at Shinji but he was only half-heartedly listening to the conversation behind him, happy that his role as chief breakfast provider kept him busy from having to take part in his room-mate's usual morning routine.

_At l_east _Asuka seems to be back to her_ _usual self._ Which likely meant her appetite would be making an appearance. _I'll put extra on her plate, that should keep her happy._

Thinking back to last night, he realised the almost serene atmosphere between them would be unlikely to continue today. Today, his usual "_good morning",_ was met with a scowl but she otherwise didn't say anything. Shinji would worry at this but he had other things on his mind making him equally uncomfortable and they were likely the same two things bothering Asuka.

Soryu and Shikinami would be arriving to eat breakfast with them.

Soryu's question last night about his parents raised uncomfortable thoughts but after a night's rest, realised she wasn't to blame.

But that didn't make it any easier.

_Dammit, Misato,_ he thought with little energy. His guardian had returned last night to inform he she would be sleeping over and she caught him just as he was going to bed.

"_I'm sorry Shinji, I should've warned you but with all the rush around their tests and reports and handling Asuka, I guess it just…"_

Her apology had been heartfelt and Shinji couldn't stay upset at her. The thought still shocked him, even after Misato's explanation of where Soryu came from. A world where both his parents were together. And he was there with them. A family. It seemed unreal.

_I wonder if that version of me is happy, there?_ He frowned at the obvious answer. Of course he would be.

The sizzling sound of the pan kicked him back out of his thoughts - the eggs were nearly done and a sudden _ping!_ let him know the toast was ready too. He started on getting the plates ready when a sudden commotion brought his attention back to the conversation at the table.

"Shopping?!" came the cry from Asuka.

"Shopping," Misato said with a smile. Out of her jacket she fished out a red card with the Nerv logo and the word _Kredit_ clearly visible in white, "Nerv has agreed to cover their expenses. So I thought we'd make it a girl's day out, what do you say? We can't have them borrowing your clothes all the time, so this was the easiest solution."

Asuka cheered, before shooting a sly look at Misato.

"And easier on your wallet too, huh Misato?"

"Oh, be quiet," Misato retorted, making a face.

Shinji started to set the plates and he caught Asuka's expression, it was thoughtful and remained that way as her eyes wandered over to him. They locked eyes and Shinji all of a sudden, felt a chill down his spine.

"Misato," said Asuka, her voice carefully neutral as she stared at him, "who's going to carry all our shopping bags?"

_Uh oh._

Shinji quickly turned back to the kitchen counter and busied himself with scrubbing an already clean plate with more vigour than necessary and pretending he hadn't heard the entire exchange.

_I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away-_

"I'm afraid we'll have to manage ourselves," Misato came up next to him to make herself another coffee, "Shinji, you've got a cross-sync test at headquarters. Don't be late, understood?"

Shinji's sigh of relief was palpable. He answered with a "_Yes ma'am!"_ and tried not to look too cheerful. _Thank you Misato, thank you, thank you. Kaji you idiot, marry her already._

Asuka frowned at Misato's words.

"Hey, why aren't I being tested? Is there something wrong with me?" she asked.

"Well, we didn't think you'd want to pilot any other Eva apart from Unit-02 so…" Misato said, hands up in a placating manner. It seemed to work and Asuka smiled, nodding happily.

Just as he was beginning to set the table, the door chimed and still in 'work' mode Shinji began taking off his apron and went to open it without much thought.

The door slid open and he found himself face to face with Soryu and Shikinami.

He froze.

"Uh…"

Soryu as in their first meeting, seemed to react first.

"Good morning, Shinji," she smiled and stepped forward, "may we come in?"

He was about to answer when her words from last night suddenly appeared.

_Shinji, where's your mom and dad?_

His breath caught, eyes wide. Soryu tilted her head and with a puzzled "_Shinji?"_ she took another step towards him, across the threshold to the apartment.

_Shinji, where's your mom and dad?_

He took a step back, his hands gripping the edges of his apron as if it were a life vest. He swallowed painfully and tried to form a proper greeting.

"P-please, come in, breakfast is ready in the kitchen...," he said to both of them, trailing off as neither seemed to move. Realising he was standing in their way, he quickly turned around and hurried inside.

He stepped through the kitchen ignoring Asuka and Misato and went straight to his room.

Leaning against door as he closed it behind him, he took a moment to collect his thoughts in the quiet solace of his bedroom.

_Shinji, where's your mom and dad?_

What would Soryu say to him now? Would he have to talk with her? Would she tell him about a family he never had. Never _could_ have? The thought was too painful to contemplate. Screwing his eyes shut, he tried to control his breathing finding the room uncomfortably stuffy.

He took a deep breath and opened his eyes.

He spotted his SDAT on the bed. He could leave now.

So he did.

Grabbing the SDAT, Shinji made a beeline out the apartment with only mumbled words announcing his departure.

"H-hey wait!" said a voice, startled by his sudden reappearance and exit.

Was that Asuka? Or Soryu? He didn't look back.

He ignored her. _I don't want to hear it! Whatever you have to say,_ he thought frantically, almost tripping up as he put on his shoes and it wasn't until he was well out of the apartment complex that he could feel his heartbeat slowing.

He sighed as he came to a realisation.

_I ran away._

Putting in his earphones, he made his way to Nerv Headquarters.

---

_Even here, you're still a brat._

The thought had repeated itself all morning but she pushed it aside as she inspected the skirt in front of her.

"So why do they call you the 'Second Child', anyway?"

The question was asked to Asuka who stood on the opposite side of the clothing rack.

Both she and Soryu had a variety of items already picked out and had been circling through the displays in each store they went to. Shikinami couldn't help but notice the two were being careful to keep some distance apart as if to avoid the impression they had the same interest in clothes.

_So she's finally stopped sulking,_ Shikinami thought. Soryu had kept quiet for most of the morning, obviously distracted by Shinji Ikari's actions. And maybe also bothered by her own inaction.

_You've done nothing wrong. He'll just disappoint you._

Shikinami kept the thought to herself, deciding to let the girl stew. Now it seemed Soryu's unending curiosity had finally returned. Unfortunately for Asuka, she was the first target.

Asuka turned to face Soryu, unclear what exactly she was getting at.

"_What?"_

Soryu, combing through a line of summer shorts, didn't let the wary tone phase her.

"I mean, why 'second' child? Why not 'first'?" She turned and shot a sly smile at Asuka, "Are you only good enough for second place?"

Both Asuka and Shikinami blinked. _So_ _she thinks our pilot designations are rankings?_

"T-that's not…" Asuka started and stopped, at a loss for words and caught off guard. But heard it for what it was - a criticism of her piloting skills.

Shikinami silently marvelled as Asuka's face started to turn red with hands balled at her side. _Better step in before this gets ugly,_ she thought and she moved closer, putting a hand on Soryu's shoulder.

"It's not a placement. It's simply the order in which we were given our pilot status," she said to her gently, "_Second Child_ means we were the second ones to be given the designation of Eva pilot."

"You mean there's no competition?" Soryu deflated a little at that, "how boring."

Asuka shot a look at Shikinami, one that said '_I don't need your help'_ but simmered down.

"Of course it's not a competition, everybody already knows I'm the best pilot," Asuka finally said.

"Oh? So you're better than Shinji?" said Soryu.

"Pfft! That idiot? Of course I'm better," Asuka beamed with pride.

Soryu considered the answer for a moment before nodding to herself.

"I guess that does makes sense. Anyone who possesses _my_ talents would do well at anything."

"_Y-Your talents?!_ I think you have that the wrong way around," Asuka scoffed, "what do you know anyway? You're just a grade schooler."

_Should I say something?_ Shikinami wondered to herself, half wanting to stop the argument yet strangely fascinated at watching the two of them from the sidelines.

"Well, so are you!" Soryu, straightening up with indignation.

"Ah," Asuka smirked back at the girl, "but that's where you're wrong, _little_ _Miss Soryu._ I've already finished college."

That stopped Soryu's retort and even Shikinami took in this information in silence. _Really? At her age?_

"Really?!" Soryu finally said.

Asuka simply smiled.

"Yup, I graduated last year. Just ask Misato," she shrugged at their scepticism, "I'm only in school because Nerv says I have to be."

Soryu turned to Shikinami, almost pleadingly.

"Don't tell me you've finished college too?!"

Shikinami sighed internally as she caught Asuka looking at her with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. _No point lying._

"No, I never went," she replied pleasantly to Soryu who nodded happily at finding someone on her level.

But it was Asuka that Shikinami spoke to next.

"I'm an Eva pilot first and foremost," her own smile turned icy, "I'm not _second_ in anything."

Asuka's eyes narrowed at the words but made no reply. _Hmph, got you there, didn't I?_

"Well, one of us has an Eva and it's _not you,_" Asuka said finally, "you'll see how good I am in the next battle."

"_Oh?_ You think so?"

"That's right. I was _born_ to pilot Eva," said Asuka, folding her arms. All but daring Shikinami to escalate things further. She considered Asuka's words, _born to pilot Eva? You have no idea._

The two stared at each other for a moment, neither willing to back down or break eye contact first. Shikinami wondered what she had been expecting from the girl.

_You're just as bad as he is._

Soryu meanwhile looked from one to the other with slightly worried eyes.

"M-maybe I should pick out something for when it's a little colder? Oh, Misato!" Soryu waved to an approaching Misato and shot off, leaving the two standing there.

Her words broke the tension and Shikinami blinked

_What am I doing?_

Picking fights with children? Taunting Asuka? Was it just because of pride?

Or was it something else? Something eerily similar in Asuka's words and actions that reminded her of- _No,_ she ended the thought there and then, not liking where it was going. _No, I shouldn't get involved._

She turned away from the other girl.

She didn't expect Asuka to sidle up alongside her. _What now?_ Her heart beat a little faster with a rush of adrenaline. Involuntarily gearing up for a fight.

She needn't have worried.

Asuka made a show of looking over the skirt she was holding with a critical eye.

"Wow, someone with Misato's taste in fashion, _bleh!_ You can keep it," she reached over, a little too closely, to pick out a blouse and shorts combo

"This is better don't you think?" asked Asuka, holding the items up. She smiled sweetly.

Shikinami knew this wasn't really about the clothes but she was no longer in the mood for a fight.

"It's nice, I guess," she said with a sigh.

Asuka hummed thoughtfully, pleased with the response. And with that she returned to browsing by herself. Shikinami watched her go and could only shake her head.

Asuka Langley Soryu - Eva pilot - whatever the girl's problems, was not _her_ problem.

She would be quiet and wait. Until she left this world.

She had nothing to fear from Asuka, of course. But Misato? Nerv? If they thought she was making trouble then things could get worse for her. She had no wish to return to a locked room.

_Now where's Soryu?_

Shikinami looked behind her to find Soryu no longer there. A quick look and she spotted the girl skipping away to the nearest changing room along with Misato, both of them with a colourful variety of clothes in hand. Apparently none the wiser at the little exchange just now.

_This girl…_

Shaking her head, she stepped over to her own much smaller selection of items and wondered if she needed anything else. Remembering the skirt in her hands, she gave it a once over but in the end, put it back.

No, it was too short for her liking, but…

---

"...Mari would like this."

Asuka caught herself from turning her head at the words. The strange Shikinami girl seemed unaware she had spoken out loud.

Asuka thought for a moment.

_Mari? Where have I heard that before?_

---

"Ooh, that hit the spot! I'm getting some more!"

Misato excused herself from the table to line up again at the dessert counter. The small cafe they found themselves in was surprisingly quiet and a pleasant change from the rush of crowds outside.

Shikinami watched as Asuka followed her guardian without a word.

She looked down at the empty bowl in front of her, feeling her stomach rumbling at the sight. She was _still_ hungry? She took a discreet glance around the table to find Soryu happily digging into her ice-cream sundae.

_What's with this appetite?_

She sighed and sipped noisily through the straw of her drink to distract herself. Maybe she could grab a snack once they were back at the apartment. Or maybe…

_Will he cook again tonight?_

She didn't like how her mouth watered at the thought.

She sat back, drink in hand and tried to enjoy the peace and quiet around her, wishing she could feel as content as Soryu.

Both of them were happy to rest their feet. Misato had led the group from one fashion outlet to the next as if on a mission to hit every clothing store in central Tokyo-3.

It was mid afternoon when Misato suggested stopping for a break. The girls readily agreed and so found themselves here, apparently a favourite of Asuka's. They had sat themselves down along with the small pile of shopping they had acquired.

Shikinami let out a deep breath as she waited for the day to be over. Crowds were never her thing.

Looking out the large window they were seated beside, she watched as people of all sorts went about their day.

There were workers, families, couples, school aged children, teenagers and the elderly. It was a bright, cloudless day, the streets were bustling and the sounds of a welcome weekend were all around them. Even in the heart of the fortress city, life went on.

_It'll never stop surprising me._..

"Not hungry?"

Shikinami turned to find Soryu eyeing her curiously.

"No," she lied and shook her head before turning back to the view outside, more to avoid Soryu's gaze than anything else.

She remembered their conversation last night. The girl's honesty had been a surprise. _Maybe for her too._ Thinking how best to answer Soryu, she realised there wasn't any harm in opening up to her in return.

Just a little.

"I guess I'm not used to the attention."

The three Asukas had drawn eyes everywhere they went. Inconspicuous, they were not.

"I know, right? You'd think people hadn't seen triplets _before_," Soryu said, her voice rising as she turned around to shoot a dark glare behind them.

With a sound like someone choking on their food and a quick shuffle of chairs, she saw an older man hurriedly leave the store - a half eaten crepe still in one hand. They watched as he walked past the window where they sat, only to notice their combined glares still directed at him. With a small shout of fear, he hurried along, nearly spilling his food as stepped into the crowd.

Soryu laughed as she took a bite out of her sundae with a "_Hmph, serves him right!"_ and Shikinami couldn't help but smile in return.

"And I'm glad we got out of those uniforms," Soryu said.

Shikinami nodded in agreement.

She reached up to tug at the tassels of the sweatshirt she now wore but resisted the urge to pull the hood over her head. Combined with the loose slacks, her choice of clothing was comfortable if a little plain. Perfect for the summer climate.

A sharp contrast to Soryu and Asuka's choices which were decidedly more on the feminine side than her own.

"I wonder what Shinji will think."

Shikinami raised an eyebrow at the words as she watched Soryu admire her new attire. They were both interrupted before anything further could be said.

"Why do you care what that idiot thinks anyway?"

Asuka had returned, along with Misato both with modest slices of cake in hand. Asuka's was chocolate, with sliced strawberries and drizzled with even more chocolate. Shikinami dragged her eyes away.

"Well, he wouldn't even talk to me this morning. And last night…" Soryu trailed off.

"Geez, you still hung up about that?" Asuka rolled her eyes. She sat down and helped herself to a heaped spoonful of cake before continuing.

"Shinji's always been an oddball. _You two_ showing up like you did probably fried his poor brain!"

"I wouldn't worry about Shinji. He'll come around, you'll see," added Misato as she took a sip of her coffee.

"If you say so," Soryu said.

Misato grinned at the girl.

"Though it's kinda cute you care about him so much. Anything you want to share?" the comment accompanied by knowing look.

Soryu went red.

Shikinami couldn't help rolling her eyes.

Asuka looked disgusted.

"_Great_, just what we need - _someone else_ for the Third to have babying him," she said with a pointed look at Misato. Misato shrugged. Asuka turned back to Soryu.

"I still can't believe you and _him_ are _friends_."

"Why not?" Soryu said, now the one to look indignant.

"I would've expected my _counterpart_ to have better taste," Asuka sighed dramatically, "my fault for expecting too much."

"There's nothing wrong with him."

"Says you."

"I do. You don't know him the way I do,"

"_Ewww,_ don't say it like that," Asuka said, pushing back her chair, aghast. Misato laughed.

Shikinami let the conversation wash over her, not wanting to get involved in the two bickering whilst Misato did her best to defend the absent Shinji Ikari.

"You know Asuka, you _could_ be nicer to him."

"I am nice to him, he's lucky I even let him live with us."

"Shinji was here _before_ you Asuka"

"Details, details."

"And don't forget he saved you from that volcano,"

Shikinami froze. _What?_

"And I returned the favour, we're even now!"

"Volcano?" Soryu said.

"Well, I can't say too much because, you know, classified…"

Misato leant forward and began speaking in a hushed tone.

Shikinami turned her head just a fraction to listen better. It was probably nothing.

But she listened anyway.

"Asuka, in her Unit-02, was almost a goner. She was falling, deeper and deeper into volcano at Mt. Asama. But Shinj, in his Eva, jumped in _unprotected_ to save her. That boy didn't even wait for orders." she sat back against the chair nodding sagely and as she took a sip of coffee.

"Chewed him out good for pulling a stunt like that, heh," she added.

The table was silent as they all took in this information.

"_Wow,_" was all Soryu could muster, her eyes shining with wonder.

"_Hmph,_ I defeated the Angel, you _always_ leave that part out," Asuka said.

"So even your Shinji has his good points! C'mon, you can admit that much," asked Soryu, nudging Asuka with her elbow and sounding pleased at having the tables being turned.

Asuka gave the girl an annoyed stare before sighing in defeat.

"I never said he didn't," she said in a small voice, "and he's not 'my Shinji', he's an idiot," Asuka finished. But there was no venom in her words and she turned away from Soryu's sly look, her expression thoughtful.

The silence was interrupted by Misato's phone ringing and a few short words later, the older woman stood, her expression stern.

"There's been a problem at Nerv. We have to go," and with that she turned to leave. Asuka and Soryu followed suit and began to collect their bags.

Shikinami sat rooted in place as Misato's words replayed themselves in her mind.

"He… saved her?" she whispered to herself.

She slowly turned to watch Asuka walk out. As she complained to Misato about their shopping trip being cut short. Watched as the girl carried on with her life.

All the while feeling that slow undercurrent of anger bubbling up. She reached down to grab her bags and made her way out the door, her movements on automatic.

Thinking.

Events had gone more differently here than she had realised.

_No. I don't care._

She watched and could only wonder what made _her_ so different.

_I don't care._

_This has nothing to do with me._

_I don't care at all._

And the image of the Shinji Ikari she knew came to her.

_Why couldn't he save me?_

Later that night, Asuka was speaking to Hikari on the phone, catching up to a week's worth of news and gossip. As they talked, her eyes roamed over the new clothes strewn across her bedroom. It was a nice haul all things considered.

She glanced at the door across from her own, Shinji's room. The boy was staying overnight at Nerv for observation after his attempt at activation with Unit-00. She thought about the worry in Soryu's face as Misato had relayed them the news, _great just what the Third needed, a fangirl moping over him._

Maybe she was being too harsh? She couldn't overlook the meal he had prepared for her, even if the appearance of the two other Asukas was an unexpected surprise for him. Speaking of which...

Shikinami. The girl wanted to be all mysterious, that was fine by her. But the name she had mentioned - _Mari -_ Asuka was certain she had heard it _somewhere._ It had piqued her curiosity. It may end up being nothing but she couldn't let go until she found an answer. She had been planning to call Hikari anyway, so she waited as they went through the polite and customary responses as expected from Hikari.

"I'm fine really, Dr. Akagi just wanted to run some tests. You know what hospitals are like..." she left the thread dangling, hoping the girl would take it.

She waited.

_Bingo!_

"The jock?"

She put on her best _I'm-totally-not-curious_ voice and asked what she had wanted to all along.

_"Oh,_ he has a sister? What was her name again?"

**Author Notes:**

Massive thank you to everyone who's reviewed over the past year since chapter 2! Especially the guest reviewers who I can't directly reply to (an account just to make replying to easier is worth it!).

The delay with the chapter was partially life getting the way and partially being completely stuck upon _really_ realising how difficult it is to write characters who don't want to talk to each other.

About Shiki's flashback with Mari, I don't think there's anything canon wise as to how Shiki and Mari first meet. But I loved their banter and how comfortable they were around each other and that was something I wanted to explore just a little. Shinji's reluctance with speaking with Soryu I hope comes across as genuine, I can't imagine he'd be willing to chat over tea over such a sensitive topic. This chapter has everything I wanted in it so very happy with that.

No promises for Chapter 4 but my hope is it won't be as long as the gap between ch2 and ch3. Might even write one or two oneshots just to keep things fresh.

Thank you for reading and reviewing. And I'm always happy to read people's thoughts, it's always appreciated. C&C welcome!
