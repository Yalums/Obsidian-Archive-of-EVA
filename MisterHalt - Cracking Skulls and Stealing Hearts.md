Asuka goads Shinji into a kiss, but something unexpected results when it doesn't go as she hoped.  
明日香怂恿真嗣接吻，但事情并没有如她所愿，结果发生了意想不到的事情。

---
_'I'm bored.' '我很无聊。'_

Asuka slowly tapped a finger against the table. She was sitting in the kitchen, head resting sideways on an arm, wishing there was something to do. Her eyes darted to the side, where her fellow pilot Shinji Ikari was sitting in the doorway nearby, reading something.  
明日香用一根手指慢慢地敲击着桌子。她坐在厨房里，头侧靠在手臂上，希望能有事可做。她的目光飞向一边，她的飞行员同事碇真司正坐在附近的门口看书。

_'Just what is up with him? Is he freaking blind or something?'  
‘他到底怎么了？他是不是瞎了眼还是怎么的？_

Somehow, the Third Child had so far managed to completely miss every cue Asuka had given off that she might be interested in the possibility of a more personal relationship between the two of them. Even when she had practically shoved her chest in his face while wearing a bikini, Shinji hadn't reacted as she had expected.  
不知何故，第三个孩子到目前为止完全忽略了明日香发出的每一个暗示，即她可能对他们两个之间建立更私人关系的可能性感兴趣。即使当她穿着比基尼几乎把胸部推到他脸上时，真嗣也没有像她预料的那样做出反应。

_'Maybe I should just give up and go back to chasing Kaji.'_ Asuka grimaced as she remembered that the handsome unshaven man had essentially blown her off to go somewhere with Misato. She was beginning to think that she had lost the contest for Kaji's heart, and wondered if she had ever been in the running in the first place.  
“也许我应该放弃，回去追加持。”当明日香想起那个胡子拉碴的英俊男子实际上是让她和美里一起去某个地方时，她做了个鬼脸。她开始认为自己在争夺加持芳心的竞赛中失败了，并想知道自己是否曾经参与过竞争。

A quiet 'wark' gave Asuka something else to focus on. Just past Shinji, in the darkness of the lounge room, their penguin housemate Pen-Pen was napping. There was another 'wark', which seemed to be his way of snoring, and Shinji glanced over at the avian for a moment before smiling gently and returning his attention to his magazine.  
一声安静的“警告”让明日香有了其他可以集中注意力的事情。刚经过真嗣，在黑暗的休息室里，他们的企鹅室友潘潘正在打盹。又是一阵“呜呜”声，这似乎是他打鼾的方式，真嗣看了那只鸟一会儿，然后轻轻地笑了笑，把注意力转回杂志上。

That smile stopped Asuka's tapping finger, and she found herself focusing intently on the boy's face. Specifically, his mouth.  
那笑容阻止了明日香敲击的手指，她发现自己全神贯注地看着男孩的脸。具体来说，就是他的嘴。

_'I wonder what it'd feel like to-'  
“我想知道那会是什么感觉——”_

She frowned. With how clueless he was, there was likely going to be no chance of _that_ happening.  
她皱起眉头。以他的无知程度，恐怕根本就不可能发生这种事。

_'So make it as obvious as possible. How? By being the one to initiate it. The Third would never take the first step, so do it yourself.'  
'所以让​​它尽可能明显。如何？成为发起这一行动的人。老三永远不会迈出第一步，所以你自己来吧。_

But she couldn't just walk up and plant a kiss on him. It was practically guaranteed that something would go wrong, they'd both be embarrassed beyond belief, and their relationship would suffer.  
但她不能就这么走过去亲吻他。几乎肯定会出问题，他们都会尴尬得难以置信，他们的关系也会受到影响。

_'Well, he_ did _risk his life to save yours...'_  
“嗯，他确实冒着生命危险来救你……”

Asuka mentally scoffed. Of _course_ the Third Child saved her. They were Evangelion pilots. Part of their job was to watch each other's backs.  
明日香在心里嗤笑道。当然是老三救了她。他们是新世纪福音战士的飞行员。他们的部分工作就是互相监视。

But Shinji had saved her while disobeying a direct order from their commanding officer. Misato had tried to order him to stay put, and let Asuka _die._ But Unit-01, without any protection against the lava like her Unit-02 possessed, had jumped straight into the volcano and caught her. Which wouldn't have been necessary if the Angel hadn't objected to being caught and severed the line that would have brought her back to the surface. It would have been a Pyrrhic victory if Shinji hadn't suddenly shown that he _did_ have a spine.  
但真嗣却违背了指挥官的直接命令，救了她。美里曾试图命令他留在原地，让明日香死去。但01号机不像她的02号机那样拥有任何熔岩防护，直接跳进了火山并抓住了她。如果天使没有反对被抓住并切断了将她带回地面的绳索，那么这是没有必要的。如果真嗣没有突然表明他确实有脊椎的话，这将是一场代价高昂的胜利。

_'Did you even bother to thank him for it?'  
“你甚至为此感谢过他吗？”_

Asuka quietly exhaled as her finger began to idly tap on the table again. She hated owing anybody anything, but she didn't know what could be adequate reward for a rescue from fiery death.  
明日香轻轻地呼了口气，手指又开始漫不经心地敲击着桌子。她讨厌欠任何人任何东西，但她不知道什么才算是足够的奖赏，才能把自己从烈火中拯救出来。

_'Don't be stupid. Yes you do. And it's a perfect excuse.'  
“别犯傻了。是的你是。这是一个完美的借口。_

She gave up, but not before forming a contingency plan.  
她放弃了，但在制定应急计划之前她放弃了。

"Hey Shinji, do you wanna kiss me?"  
“嘿，真嗣，你想吻我吗？”

Shinji took one of his SDAT's earbuds out and looked at Asuka. "Eh? What?" he asked, clearly unable to believe what he had just heard.  
真嗣拿出SDAT的一只耳机，看着明日香。 “呃？什么？”他问道，显然不敢相信自己刚才听到的话。

"Kissing, you know. Have you ever done it?" Asuka inquired. The boy shook his head in response. Of course he had never kissed somebody. She sat up straight and said, "So let's do it."  
“接吻，你知道。你做过吗？”明日香询问道。男孩摇摇头作为回应。当然，他从来没有亲吻过别人。她坐直身子，道：“那我们就这么做吧。”

Shinji recoiled slightly. "Uh... But... why?"  
慎二微微后退了一步。 “呃……但是……为什么？”

Asuka smirked. So far he was acting exactly as she expected, which was a little sad in a way. "I've got nothing else to do."  
明日香苦笑着说道。到目前为止，他的表现完全符合她的预期，这在某种程度上有点悲伤。 “我没有别的事可做。”

That was the contingency. If everything went alright, she could claim it was her reward. If not, well she was just looking for something to do to pass the time. What could go wrong here? It was just going to be a kiss.  
这就是偶然事件。如果一切顺利的话，她可以说这是她的奖励。如果没有，那么她只是想找点事情做来打发时间。这里可能会出现什么问题？这只是一个吻。

"That's your reason? You're weird..."  
“这就是你的理由？你很奇怪……”

Asuka fumed internally. Was he really going to try and get out of this? She was _not_ going to let him slip away again. "Afraid to kiss a girl on the anniversary of your mum's death? Is she watching you from up in heaven?"  
明日香内心怒火中烧。他真的想尝试摆脱这一切吗？她不会再让他溜走。 “害怕在你妈妈去世的周年纪念日亲吻女孩吗？她在天堂看着你吗？”

"That's not it..." Shinji quietly began, but she pressed the attack.  
「不是这样的……」真嗣小声开口，但她还是强行攻击。

"Or are you scared?" “或者说你害怕了？”

_That_ got him stood up and sharply said, "I'm not afraid! Pucker up!"  
这让他站了起来，厉声道：“我不怕！撅起嘴来！”

Asuka stood up too. "Right. Did you brush your teeth?"  
明日香也站了起来。 “对了，你刷牙了吗？”

"Yeah." “是的。”

"Then... here I come." “那……我来了。”

She moved towards him, stopping when they were only a couple feet apart. Asuka could now hear the tinny sound of whatever Shinji was listening to on his SDAT, left on the floor under the magazine. They stared at each other for a few seconds, before Asuka decided it was time to take the initiative and lean forward a little. Shinji closed his eyes as she pursed her lips, their mouths now only separated by mere centimetres, but she stopped, staring at his face in such close proximity. The Third Child was blushing furiously. Obviously wondering what was happening, he opened his eyes again.  
她朝他走去，当他们相距只有几英尺时停了下来。明日香现在可以听到真嗣在他的 SDAT 上听的声音，SDAT 留在杂志下面的地板上。他们对视了几秒钟，然后明日香决定是时候采取主动并稍微向前倾身了。真嗣闭上了眼睛，她抿起了嘴唇，两人的嘴现在只有几厘米的距离，但她停了下来，盯着他的脸，距离如此之近。老三气得满脸通红。显然是想知道发生了什么，他再次睁开了眼睛。

Asuka thought quickly. "Stop breathing, it's tickling me," she grumbled.  
明日香飞快地想道。 “停止呼吸，它让我发痒，”她抱怨道。

Shinji only had enough time to widen his eyes before she pinched his nostrils shut and leaned all the way in. Their lips met and she closed her eyes, waiting for that special... thing to happen.  
真嗣只来得及睁大眼睛，她就捏住他的鼻孔，将身体倾入全身。他们的嘴唇相触，她闭上眼睛，等待着那件特别的……事情发生。

Now she understood the term 'dead fish lips'. The boy seemed to have completely frozen. He wasn't doing _anything_ besides standing there. Wasn't the guy supposed to hold the girl? The only thing Asuka noticed was the sound of Pen-Pen cautiously moving past them to get into his fridge.  
现在她明白了‘死鱼唇’这个词了。男孩似乎完全僵住了。他除了站在那里什么也没做。男的不是应该抱着女的吗？明日香唯一注意到的是笔笔小心翼翼地从他们身边走过，进入冰箱的声音。

_He wasn't doing anything.  
他什么也没做。_

Asuka had to make a decision soon. She had taken a short breath before diving in, but she refused to breathe through her nose and give Shinji the chance to complain about fairness or whatever. Her lungs were starting to complain, but she didn't want to give in.  
明日香必须尽快做出决定。她在潜入之前短暂地吸了一口气，但她拒绝用鼻子呼吸，也不给真嗣抱怨公平或其他什么的机会。她的肺部开始抱怨，但她不想屈服。

Shinji finally seemed to be doing _something_ now. Asuka heard faint noises coming from him, and his head seemed to be trembling. Was he starting to run out of breath too? She opened her eyes, which immediately widened when she realised what she was looking at.  
真嗣现在似乎终于有所作为了。明日香听到他身上传来微弱的声音，他的头似乎在颤抖。他是不是也开始喘不过气来了？她睁开了眼睛，当她意识到自己在看什么时，眼睛立刻睁大了。

Shinji's face, previously just blushing bright red, was now turning blue, and his eyes were rolling up to the back of his head. His entire body was beginning to suffer from oxygen deprivation. Out of pure surprise, she let go of his nose and ended the kiss.  
真嗣的脸原本还只是红扑扑的，现在已经变成了青色，眼睛翻到了后脑勺。他的整个身体开始缺氧。出于纯粹的惊讶，她松开了他的鼻子，结束了这个吻。

Just in time for Shinji to cough directly into Asuka's face at point blank range. A bit of saliva flew directly into her mouth and hit the back of her throat.  
正好真嗣直接对着明日香的脸咳嗽。一口口水直接飞进了她的嘴里，撞到了喉咙后面。

"Blech, gross!" Asuka exclaimed as she shoved him away, before turning around to run to the bathroom. However, she barely made it two steps before hearing something unexpected behind her.  
“布莱赫，恶心！”明日香惊呼一声，将他推开，然后转身跑向卫生间。然而，她刚走出两步，身后就传来了意想不到的声音。

Shinji, backing up to try and keep his balance after the shove, let out a sound of surprise as his foot slipped on the magazine and SDAT that had been left in the doorway. His legs flew out from underneath him, and Asuka turned around just in time to watch the back of his head hit the tiled floor with a sickening crack that would remain lodged in her mind for a long time.  
真嗣在被推挤后向后退了一步，试图保持平衡，但当他的脚踩在留在门口的杂志和SDAT上时，他发出了一声惊讶的声音。他的双腿从身下飞了出来，明日香及时转过身，看到他的后脑勺撞在瓷砖地板上，发出令人作呕的裂痕，这种裂痕将在她的脑海中留下很长一段时间。

"...Shinji?" 「……真嗣？」

She took a hesitant step towards the boy sprawled out on the ground. His eyes were closed, and the only sign of life was the very slow rise and fall of his chest. Pen-Pen chose that moment to peek out of his fridge to see what the commotion was, and he let out a shocked squawk. The penguin took a moment to glare at Asuka before moving to stand near Shinji's head. He poked his cheek with a clawed flipper, before suddenly looking down at his flippers.  
她犹豫着朝趴在地上的男孩走了一步。他的眼睛闭着，唯一的生命迹象就是他的胸口缓慢的起伏。彭彭选择在这个时候从冰箱里往外看，看看发生了什么骚动，然后他发出了一声震惊的叫声。企鹅瞪了明日香一会儿，然后走到真嗣的头附近。他用带爪的鳍状肢戳了戳自己的脸颊，然后突然低头看着自己的鳍状肢。

And the slowly growing puddle of blood the penguin was standing in.  
企鹅所站的血泊慢慢变大。

As Pen-Pen tried to hop away on one foot after squawking in horror, Asuka finally broke out of her paralysis and rushed to kneel next to Shinji. Even knowing that bleeding head wounds tended to look worse than they really were didn't help; he had fallen _hard_.  
当朋朋惊恐地尖叫着试图用一只脚跳开时，明日香终于摆脱了瘫痪，冲到了真嗣身边跪下。即使知道头部流血的伤口看起来比实际情况更严重也无济于事。他重重地摔倒了。

"Shinji?" Asuka tried again while patting his cheek, her voice coming out as only a feeble whisper. "Can you hear me?"  
“真嗣？”明日香再次尝试，拍着他的脸颊，她的声音只是微弱的耳语。 “你能听到我吗？”

No response. 没有反应。

"Scheiße. Nein, nein, _nein, nein,_ _**nein**__!_ _Verdammte Scheiße, nein!_"  
“该死。不，不，不，不，不！天哪，不！”

Almost tripping over Pen-Pen in her haste, Asuka rushed to the phone and dialled a number she had been given soon after arriving in Japan, but had never expected to use. She began speaking almost before the person on the other end could give their officious greeting.  
明日香匆忙中差点被笔笔绊倒，她冲到电话旁，拨通了她刚到日本不久就得到的号码，但没想到会用这个号码。几乎在电话那头的人还没来得及热情地打招呼之前，她就开始说话了。

"This is Pilot Soryu. Pilot Ikari is hurt bad, possibly a fractured skull. Send a medical team to Major Katsuragi's apartment!"  
“我是苍龙飞行员。碇飞行员受了重伤，头骨可能骨折。派一支医疗队去葛城少校的公寓！”

The NERV operator took three seconds to absorb the information before responding with, "Acknowledged, Pilot Soryu. Medical team will be there in less than five minutes."  
NERV 操作员花了三秒钟的时间吸收了信息，然后回复道：“确认，飞行员 Soryu。医疗队将在五分钟内赶到。”

Asuka hung up, not bothering to give thanks or a goodbye. She snatched a tea towel from its drawer and folded it as she moved back over to Shinji.  
明日香挂断了电话，没有表示感谢或道别。她从抽屉里抓起一条茶巾，折叠起来，然后回到真嗣身边。

"Pen-Pen, I need you to slip this under Shinji's head while I hold it up," she ordered as she dropped the towel in front of the penguin, who replied with a serious nod.  
“朋朋，我需要你把它塞到真嗣的头下，我把它举起来。”她一边命令，一边把毛巾放在企鹅面前，企鹅严肃地点点头。

Using both hands, Asuka gingerly grasped Shinji's head and lifted it slightly, wincing at the faintly sticky sound it made. Pen-Pen placed the folded towel directly over the patch of blood, and she gently lowered the boy's head onto it, doing her best to keep it from slumping to one side.  
明日香小心翼翼地用双手抓住真嗣的头，将其轻轻抬起，因它发出的略带粘稠的声音而皱起了眉头。潘潘把折叠起来的毛巾直接放在血迹上，然后轻轻地将男孩的头放在毛巾上，尽力不让他倒向一侧。

"Hope Misato doesn't kill me for getting blood on her floor," the redhead muttered darkly, before scoffing. "She'd probably kill me for hurting Shinji though..."  
“希望美里不要因为我把血弄到她的地板上而杀了我。”红发女郎阴沉地嘀咕道，然后嘲笑道。 “不过，她可能会因为我伤害了真嗣而杀了我……”

"Wark!" “沃克！”

Asuka's eyes drifted towards the angry penguin. "Oh knock it off. I'm sure he'll be fine."  
明日香的目光飘向愤怒的企鹅。 “噢，别这样了。我相信他会没事的。”

She could see the towel starting to turn red.  
她可以看到毛巾开始变红。

"...I'm... _sure_... he'll be fine," she mumbled in apprehension.  
“……我……确定……他会没事的，”她忧心忡忡地咕哝道。

"...Right?" she asked meekly, her voice breaking on the last syllable.  
“...正确的？”她温顺地问道，说到最后一个音节时声音就断了。

Misato Katsuragi was many things while drunk: loud, boisterous, a little too friendly depending on who else was around. But she was not blind.  
葛城美里喝醉后有很多表现：吵闹、喧闹，还有点过于友好，这取决于周围的人。但她并不盲目。

There was an ambulance in the parking lot of her apartment complex. This in itself did not raise any alarm bells until she and Kaji got a little closer and saw the discreet symbol of the organisation she worked at.  
她的公寓楼停车场停着一辆救护车。这本身并没有引起任何警钟，直到她和卡吉靠近一点，看到了她所工作的组织的谨慎标志。

"Trouble," Kaji remarked, but Misato was already stumbling forward as a stretcher came through the lobby door.  
“麻烦了，”梶说道，但当担架从大厅门进来时，美里已经跌跌撞撞地向前走去。

"What's-" Misato quickly covered her mouth and gulped down her nausea. "What's going on?!" she demanded of the medics.  
“什么——”美里连忙捂住嘴，咽下恶心的感觉。 “这是怎么回事？！”她要求医护人员。

"Step aside please, lady," the man at the head of the stretcher tersely replied.  
“女士，请让开。”担架首长的男子简短地回答道。

She moved to let them pass, but one look at the stretcher's occupant was all it took. She might have been drunk, but that didn't make her any less a NERV officer. "'Lady?!' I am Major Misato Katsuragi! Now tell me what the hell happened to my boy!"  
她想要让他们过去，但只看了一眼担架上的人就够了。她可能喝醉了，但这丝毫不影响她作为 NERV 警官的身份。 “'女士？！'我是葛城美里少校，现在告诉我我的孩子到底发生了什么事！”

It did make her an _angry_ NERV officer tonight, though.  
不过，这确实让她今晚成为一名愤怒的 NERV 官员。

The man paled. A drunk superior officer was clearly not what he wanted to deal with. "Um... unsure, Major. We got a call about five minutes ago saying that Pilot Ikari was badly hurt. When we got here he was bleeding from the back of his head. Pilot Soryu is still up there; she asked if she could ride in the back with Pilot Ikari, but... orders. Non-essential personnel, you know?."  
男人脸色惨白。一个醉酒的上级军官显然不是他想对付的。 “嗯……不确定，少校。大约五分钟前我们接到电话，说飞行员碇受了重伤。当我们到达这里时，他的后脑勺正在流血。飞行员苍龙还在上面；她问她是否可以和碇飞行员一起坐在后面，但是……命令是非必要的人员，你知道吗？”

Kaji was at her side now, placing a hand on her shoulder that was absolutely not to keep her steady. "Are _we_ 'non-essential personnel', young man?" he asked, staring directly at the now-sweating medic.  
卡吉现在就在她身边，一只手放在她的肩膀上，这绝对不是为了让她保持稳定。 “年轻人，我们是‘非必要人员’吗？”他直视着满头大汗的医生问道。

"Er... If you wish to come along you can... Major... and sir."  
“呃……如果你想一起去的话，可以……少校……还有先生。”

"You go," said Kaji to Misato. "You need to sit down anyway. I'll go upstairs and talk to Asuka, find out what happened."  
“你走吧。”梶对美里说道。 “反正你也得坐下来，我去楼上和明日香谈谈，看看到底发生了什么事。”

After helping Misato into the ambulance Kaji lazily saluted just before the rear doors were closed, before heading towards the apartment complex elevator.  
将美里扶上救护车后，梶在后门关闭前懒洋洋地行了个礼，然后朝公寓楼的电梯走去。

Misato leaned against the side of the ambulance, struggling to both stay awake and not give the paramedics another messy problem to deal with. She looked down at Shinji, and noted just how... _fragile_ he seemed on the stretcher. Very carefully, she reached out and ran a hand over his forehead. Regardless of what it did to her, she was going to be there for Shinji when he woke up.  
美里靠在救护车的一侧，努力保持清醒，以免给医护人员带来另一个棘手的问题。她低头看着真嗣，注意到他在担架上看起来是多么……脆弱。她非常小心地伸出手，抚过他的额头。不管这对她造成什么影响，当真嗣醒来时，她都会在他身边。

Misato Katsuragi was many things while drunk. But a bad guardian was not one of them.  
葛城美里喝醉后做了很多事情。但坏监护人并不是其中之一。

Not this time, at least.  
至少这一次不是。

---

Asuka barely heard the sound of the door opening again. She had hardly paid it any attention the first time, being focused solely on the unconscious boy. The unconscious boy that _she_ had caused potentially grievous injury to.  
明日香几乎再次听到了开门的声音。第一次时她几乎没有注意它，只关注那个昏迷不醒的男孩。她可能对那个昏迷不醒的男孩造成严重伤害。

The paramedics hadn't spoken much besides orders to each other and a refusal of her request to go with them. Asuka had no idea if Shinji was alright or not, and not knowing was starting to eat away at her like acid. Sitting on the floor with arms around her legs, staring at the red stain on the floor, was certainly not going to do her psyche any favours, but she couldn't bring herself to move. To get up and do _anything else_ to take her mind of the fact that she had just badly hurt Shinji.  
护理人员除了互相发出命令并拒绝她和他们一起去的请求外，没有说太多话。明日香不知道真嗣是否还好，这种不知道开始像酸一样侵蚀着她。坐在地板上，双臂抱住双腿，盯着地板上的红色污点，这当然不会给她的心灵带来任何好处，但她无法让自己移动。站起来，做点别的事情，让她忘记自己刚刚严重伤害了真嗣的事实。

"Hey, kid." “嘿，孩子。”

Asuka jolted slightly, but her eyes didn't move from the stain. The towel had soaked up a lot of it, but no attempt had yet been made to clean up.  
明日香微微晃动了一下，但她的目光却没有从污渍上移开。毛巾已经吸收了很多，但还没有尝试清理。

"Shinji's on his way to NERV's hospital now," Kaji continued as he sat down on the floor next to Asuka. "Misato's with him, but she'll probably end up passing out pretty soon."  
“真嗣现在正在去 NERV 医院的路上，”梶坐在明日香旁边的地板上继续说道。 “美里和他在一起，但她可能很快就会昏倒。”

"Drank too much again?" Asuka mumbled questioningly.  
“又喝多了？”明日香疑惑地低声说道。

"Yep. Threw up in a bin while we were on our way back. Surprised she even made it home." The girl gave a very short and humourless laugh. "But enough about her, how are _you_ doing?"  
“是的。在我们回来的路上，她被扔进了垃圾箱。令人惊讶的是，她居然还回家了。”女孩发出一阵短促而毫无幽默感的笑声。 “关于她的事情已经够多了，你怎么样？”

Asuka curled up tighter. "'m fine."  
明日香把身子蜷得更紧了。 “还好。”

"You're sitting on the floor staring at a bloodstain. That's not 'fine', Asuka." Kaji gently put an arm around her shoulders and pulled her in slightly. "Just tell me what happened, then I'll decide whether Misato should know. I won't judge you, no matter what."  
“你坐在地板上，盯着血迹。那可不好，明日香。”梶轻轻地用手臂搂住她的肩膀，将她轻轻拉了进去。 “只要告诉我发生了什么事，然后我会决定美里是否应该知道。无论如何，我不会评判你。”

Somehow, the man seemed to already know that she had played a major part in the event. Asuka finally tore her gaze away from the stain and looked up at her former guardian. "...Y-you mean it? You won't hate me?"  
不知怎的，这个男人似乎已经知道她在这件事中起了重要作用。明日香终于将视线从污渍上移开，抬头看着她曾经的守护者。 「……你、你是说真的吗？你不会恨我吧？」

Kaji shook his head. "I've looked after you for a long time. It would take far more than whatever happened tonight for me to even think about changing my opinion of you."  
卡吉摇摇头。 “我照顾你很长时间了。今晚发生的事情根本不足以让我考虑改变对你的看法。”

For the last ten minutes, Asuka had felt like she was about to break down. She grasped onto the lifeline with both hands and tried to inject some of her usual self into her response. "Well... good. But if you change your mind, I reserve the right to punch you for lying to me."  
在过去的十分钟里，明日香感觉自己快要崩溃了。她用双手抓住了生命线，试图在自己的反应中注入一些平常的自我。 “嗯……很好。但是如果你改变主意，我保留因为你对我撒谎而打你的权利。”

"Deal. Just don't go for the face." Kaji smiled disarmingly, and light glinted off a tooth. Or perhaps she was just imagining things.  
“成交。只是别为了面子。”加持毫无防备地微笑着，牙齿上闪烁着光芒。或者也许她只是想象一些事情。

And so the story came out, or at least as much as Asuka could relate without feeling like she would die of shame. Her true motivation for the kiss was kept back, as well as her disappointment that it hadn't gone as she expected.  
于是这个故事就出来了，或者至少是明日香所能讲述的，而不会让她觉得自己会羞愧而死。她对这个吻的真正动机被隐瞒了，也因为它没有按她的预期进行而感到失望。

"Well," remarked Kaji when she was finished. "You tried to kiss Shinji, but you forgot to take into account the necessity of breathing. You reflexively pushed him away after he coughed into your face, and he accidentally slipped and fell."  
“好吧，”卡吉说完后说道。 “你试图亲吻真嗣，却忘了考虑呼吸的必要性。他对着你的脸咳嗽后，你反射性地推开了他，结果他不小心滑倒了。”

"Fell because I pushed him," Asuka clarified.  
“因为我推了他才摔倒的，”明日香澄清道。

"_Accidentally._ You couldn't possibly have known that he would fall over. Shinji wasn't injured because you were being malicious, it was because of circumstances you couldn't foresee."  
“意外。你不可能知道他会摔倒。真嗣受伤不是因为你恶意，而是因为你无法预见的情况。”

Fire returned to Asuka as she grew angry about Kaji brushing off her part in the mishap. "I could have not _pushed him_!"  
当明日香因为加持不理睬她在这次事故中所扮演的角色而感到愤怒时，火又回到了她的身上。 “我不能推他！”

"Could have, would have, should have." Kaji patted her shoulder. "You can't change the past. Just answer me this: accidental or not, are you sorry for what happened?"  
“本来可以，本来可以，应该有。”加吉拍拍她的肩膀。 “你无法改变过去。只要回答我这个问题：不管是意外还是意外，你对发生的事情感到抱歉吗？”

"Yes." “是的。”

"Really?" “真的吗？”

"Yes, damnit!" “是啊，可恶！”

"Good." Kaji got to his feet, offering a supportive hand to Asuka. "By the way, I know you were holding back something in what happened, but I understand it's probably none of my business. Just be more careful the next time you and Shinji decide to mouth-wrestle."  
“好的。”梶站起来，向明日香伸出了援助之手。 “顺便说一句，我知道你在所发生的事情中隐瞒了一些事情，但我知道这可能不关我的事。下次你和真嗣决定扭嘴的时候要小心一点。”

Asuka froze in the act of standing up, practically hanging off the man's outstretched arm. "What," she flatly replied.  
明日香在站起来时僵住了，几乎挂在了男人伸出的手臂上。 “什么。”她淡淡地回答。

Kaji just grinned cheekily, even as angry Germanic words were flung at him.  
梶只是厚颜无耻地笑了笑，尽管愤怒的日耳曼语言向他扔来。

---

Misato came back to groggy wakefulness by somebody gently shaking her. It took her eyes several seconds to focus enough to see the green surgical scrubs of the man attached to the hand on her shoulder.  
有人轻轻摇晃美里，她才从昏昏沉沉的状态中清醒过来。她花了几秒钟的时间才集中注意力，看到那个男人的绿色手术服贴在她肩膀上的手上。

"Major Katsuragi?" the man said by way of greeting.  
“葛城少校？”男子以打招呼的方式说道。

"Yeah, thass me," Misato slurred. She made a face at the taste of whatever had died in her mouth. "Ugh. How long has it been?"  
“是的，就是我。”美里含糊地说。闻到嘴里死去的东西的味道，她做了个鬼脸。 “呃。多久了？”

"Three hours. Pilot Ikari will be coming out of surgery soon."  
“三个小时。飞行员碇很快就要出院了。”

Hungover as she was, the woman struggled for a bit to get to her feet. "How is he?" she almost demanded.  
尽管宿醉未醒，这位女士还是费了一番力气才站起来。 “他怎么样？”她几乎是这么要求的。

"He has suffered a linear skull fracture." At Misato's blank look, the doctor continued. "Force was applied to the back of his head, and part of his occipit... _lower_ skull has been cracked slightly. The force was strong enough to also break the skin."  
“他遭受了线性颅骨骨折。”看着美里茫然的表情，医生继续说道。 “他的后脑勺受到了强力的作用，枕骨的一部分……下颅骨也出现了轻微的裂痕。力道之大，甚至连皮肤都破裂了。”

Misato blinked. "Force...? Somebody _attacked_ Shinji?!"  
美里眨了眨眼。 「强行……？有人攻击真嗣？！」

The surgeon patted the air in a placating gesture. "We don't know how it occurred, but assault is not necessarily how it happened. A simple fall can cause this type of injury, but it's not normally as bad as this."  
外科医生拍着空气做出安抚的姿势。 “我们不知道它是如何发生的，但袭击并不一定是它是如何发生的。简单的跌倒就可能导致这种类型的伤害，但通常不会这么严重。”

"I think I can explain how it happened."  
“我想我可以解释这是怎么发生的。”

Misato and the surgeon turned to see Kaji standing nearby.  
美里和外科医生转身看到加持站在附近。

"Well don't just stand there, tell us!" the woman said frustratedly after a few seconds. "How did he get hurt so bad?"  
“那你别站在那里，快告诉我们吧！”几秒钟后，女人沮丧地说道。 “他怎么伤得这么重？”

Kaji stepped closer. "Shinji slipped on something and fell backwards. He hit the floor harder than if he had just fallen on his own."  
卡吉走近了一些。 “真嗣踩到什么东西滑倒了，向后摔倒。他摔在地板上的力气比他自己摔倒时还要重。”

Misato narrowed her eyes. "What do you mean?"  
美里眯起了眼睛。 “你是什么意思？”

"Ah," said the surgeon in understanding. "If he slipped, his head would have been travelling at a greater velocity."  
“啊，”外科医生理解地说。 “如果他滑倒了，他的头就会以更快的速度移动。”

"...I think I'll need you to tell me properly later, when I'm not hungover," Misato muttered. In response, Kaji held out a bottle of water, which made her eyes light up. "Oh gods, _thank you!"_  
“……我想等我没宿醉的时候，我需要你正确地告诉我。”美里低声说道。对此，梶递出了一瓶水，令她眼睛一亮。 “天啊，谢谢你！”

She snatched the bottle from his hand and drained half of it in seconds. It did wonders to get the horrible taste out of her mouth.  
她从他手里夺过瓶子，几秒钟之内就喝掉了一半。把那股可怕的味道从她嘴里吐出来真是奇迹。

"So how is Shinji now, doc?" Kaji inquired.  
“那么真嗣现在怎么样了，博士？”梶问道。

"We've done what we can for the fracture, and stitched up his head." The surgeon sighed. "But we'll also need to run some tests on him to check for any damage to the brain."  
“我们已经尽力治疗骨折，并缝合了他的头部。”外科医生叹了口气。 “但我们还需要对他进行一些测试，以检查大脑是否有任何损伤。”

Misato gasped, almost dropping the water bottle. "You think he might..."  
美里喘着粗气，水瓶差点掉下来。 “你认为他可能……”

"It's possible, but not a guarantee. It's better to be sure though."  
“有可能，但不能保证。不过最好确定一下。”

Kaji's expression turned serious. "How long will the tests take?"  
梶的表情变得严肃起来。 “测试需要多长时间？”

"A few more hours at the most. We already had to do a CT scan to check for any bleeding in the brain." At Misato's shocked stare, the surgeon quickly added. "We found nothing, but now that he's stabilised we'll need to do an MRI and EEG scan to check for any problems the CT scan couldn't pick up. Fortunately, since the patient is an Evangelion pilot, we have details about his brain activity on file. Doctor Akagi has already forwarded the relevant data, and we'll have that to compare the tests to. Once he's awake, we'll need to do some other tests, for hearing, vision and reaction."  
“最多几个小时。我们已经要做CT扫描来检查大脑是否有出血。”看到美里震惊的目光，外科医生赶紧补充道。 “我们什么也没发现，但现在他已经稳定下来，我们需要进行核磁共振和脑电图扫描，以检查 CT 扫描无法发现的任何问题。幸运的是，由于患者是新世纪福音战士飞行员，我们有关于他的详细信息。赤城医生已经转发了相关数据，一旦他醒来，我们就需要进行一些其他测试，包括听力、视力和反应。”

Misato swore. "It's going to be a problem, if another Angel attacks while Shinji's still hospitalised." She shook her head and sighed. "We'll deal with that when the time comes."  
美里发誓。 “如果真嗣还在住院期间，另一个天使发动袭击，那就麻烦了。”她摇摇头，叹了口气。 “到时候我们会处理这个问题。”

"Pilot Ikari should only be out of action for a few days at the most. Complete recovery will take a while longer, and he will likely be prescribed some pain medication."  
“飞行员碇最多只能缺席几天。完全康复需要一段时间，而且他可能会被开一些止痛药。”

"How soon can we see him?" Misato blurted out.  
“我们多久才能见到他？”美里脱口而出。

"Now, if you like. We can spare a few minutes before taking him to the MRI."  
“现在，如果你愿意的话。我们可以抽出几分钟时间，然后带他去做核磁共振检查。”

"Good. I just... I just need to see him." Kaji put a hand on Misato's shoulder, and one of her own soon joined it.  
“很好。我只是……我只是想看看他。”梶将一只手搭在美里的肩膀上，很快她的一只手也加入了进来。

The surgeon nodded. "I understand. This way, please."  
外科医生点点头。 “我明白了。请这边走。”

Misato and Kaji were taken to what was probably starting to be seen by NERV staff as Shinji's hospital room. The surgeon bid them farewell at the door, and the possibly-a-couple stepped into the dark room. The woman grit her teeth upon once again seeing one of her charges in a hospital bed.  
美里和加治被带到了 NERV 工作人员可能开始认为是真嗣病房的地方。外科医生在门口与他们告别，这对可能是情侣的人走进了黑暗的房间。当她再次看到医院病床上的一名照顾者时，她咬牙切齿。

"I hate having to see him like this," she whispered as she leaned into Kaji. "I keep thinking that next time he won't be as lucky."  
“我讨厌看到他这个样子，”她靠在加持身上低声说道。 “我一直在想，下次他就不会那么幸运了。”

Kaji's only response was to put an arm around her.  
加持唯一的反应就是用手臂搂住她。

"Where's Asuka anyway?" Misato quietly asked after a minute of silence. "Did she tell you what happened?"  
“明日香到底在哪里？”沉默了一分钟后，美里小声问道。 “她有告诉你发生了什么事吗？”

"She's napping in the lobby. She wanted to see Shinji as soon as possible, but I convinced her that it was going to be quite a while before he'd be available. Poor kid needed some rest anyway, she was practically falling apart when I found her in your apartment." Kaji led her over to a chair where she sat down, while he leaned against the wall nearby.  
“她正在大厅里打瞌睡。她想尽快见到真嗣，但我说服她，他要过很长一段时间才能有空。可怜的孩子无论如何都需要休息一下，当她看到真嗣时，她几乎崩溃了。”我在你的公寓里找到了她。”加治领着她走到一张椅子前坐下，而他则靠在附近的墙上。

"As for what happened, it's really just a misadventure. Just as I said before, Shinji slipped and fell hard onto the floor."  
“至于到底发生了什么，其实只是一场意外而已。正如我之前所说，真嗣脚下一滑，重重地摔在了地板上。”

Misato raised a suspicious eyebrow as she tossed the now-empty water bottle into the bin. "That's it? That's _all_ that happened?"  
美里疑惑地扬起眉毛，将空水瓶扔进垃圾桶。 “就这样？就这么回事？”

"That is precisely how Shinji got hurt," Kaji airily replied with a smirk.  
“真嗣就是这么受伤的。”梶轻笑着回答道。

"...There's something you're not telling me."  
“……有件事你没有告诉我。”

"I haven't told you about many things."  
“很多事情我都没有告诉你。”

Misato just barely kept herself from screaming.  
美里差点没忍住尖叫起来。

"Relax." Kaji raised a placating hand. "I'm going to let Asuka tell you herself. She was really broken up about it, and I had to promise that I wouldn't change my opinion about her before she'd talk to me."  
“放松。”梶举起了安抚的手。 “我会让明日香亲自告诉你。她对此真的很伤心，我必须保证在她跟我说话之前我不会改变对她的看法。”

"So she _did_ have something to do with it!"  
“这么说来，这件事确实和她有关系！”

"Misato." The woman faltered at the abrupt harshness in Kaji's tone. "I want a promise from _you_ now. Promise that when you speak to her, you'll do it with an open mind and no preconceived notions about what did or didn't happen."  
“美里。”加持突然严厉的语气让女人愣住了。 “我现在想要你的一个承诺。保证当你和她说话时，你会以开放的心态去做，并且对发生或未发生的事情没有先入为主的观念。”

"...Fine, I promise." “……好吧，我保证。”

They fell silent. A minute later, an orderly came to take Shinji away to the MRI room and Misato took that as a cue to leave and search for a certain redhead.  
他们沉默了。一分钟后，一名勤务兵过来将真嗣带到核磁共振室，美里以此为暗示离开并寻找某个红发女郎。

---

Asuka tended to sleep like a cat. She could be dead to the world one second and awake and completely alert the next. Sudden and random early morning drills in NERV Berlin had practically forced that trait upon her.  
明日香睡得像猫一样。她可能前一秒还对世界失去了知觉，下一秒就清醒了，完全警觉起来。 NERV Berlin 突然而随意的清晨演习实际上将这种特质强加给了她。

When Misato flopped onto the hospital lobby couch next to her, all it took was one sniff for Asuka to already know who had woken her up, and she began to prepare her complaint.  
当美里倒在她旁边的医院大厅沙发上时，明日香只需要轻轻一嗅就知道是谁吵醒了她，她开始准备投诉。

"Kaji told me what happened," the woman bluntly stated.  
“卡吉告诉我发生了什么事。”女人直言不讳地说。

A jolt of fear struck Asuka, mixed with anger and a feeling of betrayal.  
明日香感到一阵恐惧，夹杂着愤怒和被背叛的感觉。

"Well, he told me precisely how Shinji got hurt."  
“嗯，他准确地告诉了我真嗣是如何受伤的。”

Asuka relaxed, but only slightly.  
明日香放松了，但只是轻微的放松。

"Please, tell _me_ what happened."  
“请告诉我发生了什么事。”

Kaji's reassurances about Asuka's part in the night's debacle helped a bit. But as she slowly recounted the story a second time, the guilt began to creep back in. When she was finished, she was curled up in a ball on the couch, looking at nothing.  
加持对明日香在当晚的灾难中所扮演的角色的保证起到了一定作用。但当她第二次慢慢地讲述这个故事时，愧疚感又开始涌上心头。当她讲完时，她在沙发上蜷缩成一团，什么也没看。

At least there was no bloodstain here.  
至少这里没有血迹。

Trepidation made its presence known, as Misato simply sat there silently, arms folded and a frown on her face. Asuka began to wonder when the explosion of anger would happen as she very slowly began to inch away from the woman.  
美里只是静静地坐在那里，双臂交叉，皱着眉头，恐惧的存在让人知道。当明日香慢慢地开始远离那个女人时，她开始想知道什么时候会爆发愤怒。

"What you did," Misato finally said, "was a pretty lousy thing, Asuka."  
“你所做的事情，”美里最后说道，“是一件非常糟糕的事情，明日香。”

Asuka opened her mouth to reply, but snapped it shut. What Misato said had been what she felt she deserved to hear, but not what she expected, since Kaji had done his best to try and absolve her of guilt.  
明日香张了张嘴想要回答，但又很快闭上了。美里说的话是她觉得自己应该听到的，但不是她所期望的，因为加持已经尽了最大努力试图免除她的罪责。

"Couldn't you have done something better?"  
“你就不能做点更好的事吗？”

"Better than pushing him over, you mean?" Asuka retorted.  
“你是说，比推倒他更好？”明日香反驳道。

"What?" Misato turned her head to look at her, confusion growing on her face before realisation dawned. "Oh. No, I'm not talking about how Shinji got hurt. Despite how you feel, I understand that it was an accident. I don't blame you, Kaji doesn't either, and I'm sure Shinji won't, once he wakes up."  
“什么？”美里转过头来​​看着她，脸上浮现出困惑，然后才恍然大悟。 “哦。不，我不是在谈论真嗣是如何受伤的。不管你有什么感受，我明白那是一次意外。我不怪你，加持也不怪你，我相信真嗣不会的。” t，一旦他醒来。”

"Of course he would! I was the one who pushed him!"  
“当然会！是我推他的！”

The two of them were now glaring at each other.  
此刻，两人对视一眼。

"Asuka, I'm _not_ going to go into that anymore. It's done, you're not in trouble, just _leave it!_"  
“明日香，我不打算再谈这个了。事情已经过去了，你也不会有麻烦了，走开吧！”

The redhead folded her arms and turned away in a huff. "Easy for you to say, you're not the one that'll keep hearing the sound his head made when it hit the floor..." Asuka had in fact heard it in her mind at least five times since coming to the hospital. Six times now, since she had just brought it up.  
红发女郎抱起双臂，气呼呼地转身走开。 “说起来容易，你不会一直听到他的头撞到地板时发出的声音……” 事实上，明日香自从来到医院以来，脑子里已经听过至少五次了。 。自从她刚刚提起以来，已经六次了。

A gentle hand descended onto her shoulder. "I'm sorry Asuka," Misato apologised. "I'm still hungover, and it's making me testy." She sighed heavily. "Maybe I should have just stayed home tonight..."  
一只温柔的手落在了她的肩膀上。 “对不起，明日香。”美里道歉。 “我仍然宿醉，这让我很暴躁。”她重重地叹了口气。 “也许我今晚应该呆在家里……”

"Hmph. Maybe." Asuka uncrossed her arms and slumped against the back of the couch. "Maybe I should have thought of something else to do to try and stop being bored."  
“哼。也许吧。”明日香松开交叉的双臂，瘫坐在沙发靠背上。 “也许我应该考虑做点别的事情来尝试不再感到无聊。”

Apparently not knowing what to say to that, Misato said, "Well anyway, as I was saying, you did a lousy thing to Shinji."  
美里显然不知道该说什么，说道：“无论如何，正如我所说，你对真嗣做了一件很糟糕的事情。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "...Make up your mind, you drunk. Am I to blame for hurting him or not?"  
明日香扬起一边眉毛。 “……你下定决心吧，你这个醉汉。伤害他到底是不是我的错？”

"I'm not talking about the accident," replied Misato. "I'm referring to something else you did. Something that can't be fixed, no matter what you do."  
“我不是在谈论那次事故，”美里回答道。 “我指的是你做过的其他事情。无论你做什么都无法修复的事情。”

Turning a wary eye on the woman saying strange things, Asuka said, "How about you start making sense?"  
明日香警惕地看着那个说着奇怪话的女人，说道：“你开始讲道理如何？”

"I'll make it as simple as possible." Misato's arms were crossed and there was disappointment written across her face. "You stole Shinji's first kiss, and it's like you went out of your way to make it as terrible for him as possible."  
“我会让事情尽可能简单。”美里双手抱胸，脸上写满了失望。 “你偷走了真嗣的初吻，就好像你不遗余力地让他变得尽可能糟糕。”

After several long seconds, Asuka realised she had absolutely nothing to say in rebuttal.  
漫长的几秒后，明日香意识到自己根本无话可反驳。

"You goaded and bullied him while bringing a deceased relative into it," Misato continued, in a tone normally reserved for when she was in the role of a superior officer giving somebody a dressing down. "Then you practically choked him out, to the point that I'm sure he would have collapsed if you'd kept it up a few seconds longer."  
“你一边刺激、欺负他，一边还把一个已故的亲戚带了进来，”美里继续说道，语气通常是她扮演上级军官训斥某人时才会用的语气。 “然后你几乎让他窒息了，我确信如果你再坚持几秒钟，他就会崩溃。”

Asuka's brain made frantic calls to her speech centre. There was no reply.  
明日香的大脑疯狂地向她的语言中枢发出呼叫。没有回复。

"Hopefully his next girlfriend will be a bit more sensitive."  
“希望他的下一个女朋友能更敏感一点。”

Finally, some words managed to make their way to the redhead's mouth. "N-_next_ girlfriend?!"  
终于，有些话到了红发的嘴里。 “下、下一个女朋友？！”

Misato raised an eyebrow as her expression turned innocent. "What?"  
美里扬起一边眉毛，表情变得无辜。 “什么？”

Asuka stood up and put her hands on her hips, glaring at her guardian. "You said 'next' girlfriend. What are you implying?!"  
明日香站起来，双手叉腰，怒视着自己的守护者。 “你说‘下一个’女朋友，什么意思？！”

"I said nothing of the sort."  
“我什么都没说过。”

"Goddamnit, you crazy alchoholic, you damn well did!"  
“该死的，你这个疯狂的酒鬼，你干得很好！”

Misato got to her feet. "Hmph. Well if you're going to start calling me names, I'll just leave you alone." She rubbed her eyes. "Actually I should probably go anyway. Need more sleep."  
美里站了起来。 “哼，既然你要开始骂我，那我就不打扰你了。”她揉了揉眼睛。 “其实我应该去吧。需要更多的睡眠。”

As Misato reached the exit, Asuka called out, "Wait! Misato!" To her surprise, the woman actually stopped and turned to look at her. "Um... Is he... going to be alright?"  
当美里到达出口时，明日香喊道：“等等！美里！”让她惊讶的是，女人竟然停下来，扭头看她。 “呃……他……会没事吗？”

"The doctors are optimistic right now," Misato tiredly replied. "He's out of surgery, but they still need to run some tests."  
“现在医生都很乐观。”美里疲倦地回答道。 “他已经结束手术了，但他们仍然需要进行一些测试。”

"How long?" “多久？”

"A few more hours." “还有几个小时。”

Asuka looked away slightly, absently rubbing her right arm with her left hand. "...Which room is he staying in?"  
明日香微微移开视线，心不在焉地用左手揉着右臂。 “……他住在哪个房间？”

Misato gave her the room number, and quickly stepped aside as the Second Child strode towards the elevator where she stabbed the call button. The woman wasn't following, simply looking at her, so Asuka stepped in and let the elevator door close.  
美里给了她房间号，当老二大步走向电梯时，她迅速退到一边，按下了呼叫按钮。那个女人没有跟着，只是看着她，所以明日香走了进去，让电梯门关闭。

"Can't be fixed no matter what I do, huh?" she muttered to herself as the door opened on the appropriate floor. "We'll see about that, you boozehound."  
“无论我做什么都无法解决，对吧？”当相应楼层的门打开时，她自言自语道。 “我们会看看的，你这个酒鬼。”

---

The good thing about having to wait for Shinji's return was that Asuka had time to plan out just how she was going to make things right. Plans were mentally discarded left and right as she stood there in Shinji's hospital room staring out the window.  
等待真嗣回来的好处是，明日香有时间计划如何把事情做好。当她站在真嗣的病房里盯着窗外时，脑子里的计划被抛之脑后了。

The bad thing was that the waiting was also starting to get to her. Every plan that was thrown out was also contributing to Asuka's nervousness. At one point she even began to wonder if Shinji would hate her.  
糟糕的是，等待也开始困扰着她。每一个被抛弃的计划也让明日香更加紧张。有一次她甚至开始怀疑真嗣会不会恨她。

It was at that point when the door opened and a hospital bed was rolled in, containing a certain brown-haired boy, and all of Asuka's thoughts flew out of her head like a startled flock of birds.  
就在这时，门打开了，一张病床被推了进来，里面躺着一个棕色头发的男孩，明日香的所有思绪就像一群受惊的小鸟一样从她的脑海里飞了出去。

Tense minutes passed in silence after the orderly left, until one of the birds finally deigned to return to its roost. Asuka sat on the chair next to the bed and looked at Shinji. There was a bandage around his head, and there was likely to be a bald patch on the back of his head so that the wound could be tended to.  
勤务兵离开后，紧张的几分钟在沉默中过去了，直到其中一只鸟终于屈尊返回栖息地。明日香坐在床边的椅子上，看着真嗣。他的头上缠着绷带，后脑勺上可能有一块秃的地方，以便处理伤口。

She reflexively touched her own hair at the thought, idly noting that if she had been the one in the bed, there would have been hell to pay for touching her hair. Shinji likely wouldn't care, even if it made him look weird. But then the scar, if there was one, combined with his status as an Evangelion pilot, might convince people that he had acquired the injury in combat. And Asuka had a feeling that Shinji would just let them believe that.  
一想到这里，她就条件反射地摸了摸自己的头发，漫不经心地注意到，如果床上的人是她，那么摸她的头发就会付出惨重的代价。真嗣可能不会在意，即使这让他看起来很奇怪。但如果有伤疤的话，再加上他作为新世纪福音战士飞行员的身份，可能会让人们相信他是在战斗中受伤的。明日香有一种预感，真嗣会让他们相信这一点。

"Nngh..." “呃……”

As if he could somehow sense that somebody was thinking about him, Shinji chose that moment to twitch and let out a low groan. Which caused Asuka's thoughts to fly away again.  
真嗣仿佛察觉到有人在想念自己，在这个时刻抽搐了一下，发出一声低沉的呻吟。这让明日香的思绪又飞走了。

"Oh... _this_ ceiling again," Shinji muttered soon after his eyes fluttered open. He made to sit up...  
“哦……又是这个天花板。”睁开眼睛后，真嗣嘀咕道。他强忍着坐了起来……

And immediately hissed in pain, reaching for the back of his head, a second before a hand on his chest forced him back to horizontal. The boy let out another, shorter hiss as his head touched the pillow again. After a moment, Asuka remembered to move her hand.  
他立刻痛苦地发出嘶嘶声，伸手去抓他的后脑勺，下一秒，一只手放在他的胸口上，迫使他恢复水平。当男孩的头再次触碰枕头时，他又发出了一声更短的嘶嘶声。过了一会儿，明日香才想起要动一下手。

"Stay down, Third," she ordered. How easy it was to slip back into that habit. "You took a nasty hit." Technically true, for the moment.  
“趴下，老三，”她命令道。重新养成这个习惯是多么容易啊。 “你受到了严重的打击。”就目前而言，技术上是正确的。

"Did... I take it we won though?" asked Shinji. The strangeness of the question threw Asuka for a loop, and he continued in the wake of her silence. "I'm in hospital again, and just like the first time I don't quite remember how I got here."  
“我……我认为我们赢了吗？”真嗣问道。这个奇怪的问题让明日香大吃一惊，在她沉默后他继续说道。 “我又进了医院，就像第一次一样，我不太记得自己是怎么到这里的。”

Short term memory loss. A common symptom of head wounds. He didn't remember the kiss.  
短期记忆丧失。头部受伤的常见症状。他不记得那个吻了。

"There was no Angel." She couldn't bring herself to look at him. "Someone hurt you."  
“没有天使。”她不敢看他。 “有人伤害了你。”

"Some... one?" Shinji looked as if he were about to sit up again, so Asuka put up a cautionary hand to stop any attempt. "What did I do? Who's angry at me?"  
“一些……一个？”真嗣看起来似乎要再次坐起来，所以明日香举起手来阻止他的任何尝试。 “我做了什么？谁生我的气了？”

Asuka took a slow deep breath, and let her head drop so that her chin was resting on her chest.  
明日香慢慢地深吸一口气，低下头，让下巴抵在胸口上。

Of _course_ Shinji would instantly believe that he had pissed somebody off. That notion was only _slightly_ correct, because something he had done had made her unthinkingly lash out at him. With a nasty consequence.  
当然，真嗣立刻就会相信他惹怒了某人。这个想法只对了一点点，因为他所做的一些事情，让她不假思索地对他发了脾气。后果很糟糕。

"Thir-... Shinji," Asuka began, still looking down. "It was... me."  
“三……真嗣，”明日香开始说道，仍然低着头。 “那是我。”

She couldn't see it, but she knew the boy's eyes had shot wide open. "W-w-what?! A-Asuka... I'm sorry!"  
她看不见，但她知道男孩的眼睛睁得大大的。 「什、什、什么？！明、明日香……对不起！」

"...Sorry?" Anger bubbled up inside her. "Sorry?!"  
“...对不起？”愤怒在她内心翻腾。 “对不起？！”

Her chair fell to the ground as Asuka abruptly stood up. A second later, her hands were tightly clenching Shinji's hospital gown and her face was only centimetres from his. Again.  
当明日香突然站起来时，她的椅子掉到了地上。下一秒，她的双手紧紧地握紧了真嗣的病号服，脸距离他只有几厘米。再次。

"You're _sorry?!_ I provoke you, practically choke you out, then send you crashing to the floor so hard you crack your skull open, and all you have to say is that you're _sorry?!_"  
“你道歉了？！我激怒了你，差点把你掐死，然后把你摔倒在地，头骨都裂开了，你还要说对不起吗？！”

"S-s-s-sorry!" The now-shaking boy clenched his eyes shut and turned his head away from Asuka, who suddenly realised what she was doing. She let go of him, backing away from the bed in a daze as she belatedly noted that she was starting to earn the 'Red Demon' nickname that the Stooges always threw at her.  
“对不起、对不起！”浑身发抖的男孩紧紧闭上眼睛，把头从明日香身上移开，而明日香突然意识到自己在做什么。她放开了他，茫然地从床上退了一步，她才意识到自己开始赢得傀儡们总是给她起的“红色恶魔”绰号。

Her foot bumped the fallen chair, and Asuka stopped her retreat just in time to avoid another pilot getting injured.  
她的脚撞到了倒下的椅子，明日香及时停止了后退，避免了另一名飞行员受伤。

"Shinji... I..." Words failed the girl. The door was suddenly in her sight; an escape from this disaster. She had come here with the earnest intent to apologise, to try and make things right between them, and all she had done was hurt Shinji some more.  
“真嗣……我……”女孩说不出话来。门突然出现在她的眼前；逃离这场灾难。她来到这里是真心实意地道歉，试图调解他们之间的关系，但她所做的只是进一步伤害了真嗣。

Her hand was on the door handle when she heard Shinji shout, "A-Asuka! Wait!" It was immediately followed by a groan of agony.  
当她的手放在门把手上时，她听到真嗣喊道：“明、明日香！等等！”紧接着就是一声痛苦的呻吟。

She couldn't bear to look at him; to be in the same room as him. The shame was too great.  
她不忍心看他；和他在同一个房间。耻辱太大了。

"Please don't go..." “请不要走……”

But his plea stopped her in her tracks. Asuka couldn't be sure, but she heard something that might have been a sigh of relief.  
但他的恳求阻止了她的脚步。明日香无法确定，但她听到了可能是松了一口气的声音。

"Asuka... what happened?"  
“明日香……发生了什么事？”

She turned her head only slightly, keeping her gaze locked on the door. "...What's the last thing you remember?" she inquired in a low, glum voice.  
她只是微微侧过头，目光一直锁定在门上。 “……你记得的最后一件事是什么？”她用低沉、闷闷不乐的声音问道。

"Um..." Shinji fell silent as he searched his battered memory. "We were... at home. I was reading, you were in the kitchen."  
“呃……”真嗣沉默了，他搜索着自己破碎的记忆。 “我们……在家里。我在看书，你在厨房。”

"Anything else?" Asuka pressed.  
“还要别的吗？”明日香按下了。

"You were talking... I'm not sure what you sa-... No wait, you said something about having... nothing to do?"  
“你在说……我不确定你在说什么——……不等等，你说你……无事可做？”

She took a few tentative, jerky steps back towards the bed, but kept her eyes away from the occupant. "What next?"  
她试探性地向后退了几步，朝床边走去，但眼睛却没有看向床上的人。 “接下来是什么？”

"We... we..." Shinji tried to stifle a gasp of pain, and Asuka tried to fight an urge to get him lying down again.  
“我们……我们……”真嗣试图抑制住疼痛的喘息，而明日香则试图抑制住让他再次躺下的冲动。

She lost. 她输了。

In an instant, the injured boy was horizontal again, both of Asuka's hands pushing down on his torso.  
瞬间，受伤的少年又恢复了水平，明日香的双手按在了他的躯干上。

"Take it easy," she said. After a minute, Shinji seemed to have recovered a bit. "Try again."  
“放轻松，”她说。过了一会儿，真嗣似乎恢复了一些。 “再试一次。”

"We were... we... were..."  
“我们是……我们……是……”

Beneath her left hand, Asuka felt his heartbeat increase. She chanced a glance out the corner of her eye. Shinji's face was turning red, and his eyes were as wide as plates.  
明日香感觉到左手下的心跳加快。她偶然用眼角余光瞥了一眼。真嗣的脸涨得通红，眼睛睁得像盘子一样。

"W-w-w-we k-k-k-k-," he embarrassedly stammered.  
“W-w-w-我们k-k-k-k-”他尴尬地结结巴巴地说。

"We kissed," Asuka said for him, a blush starting to suffuse her own cheeks. "I held your nose shut, you couldn't breathe, and then when I let go you coughed into my face." Her hands began to shake as she lifted them from his body. "And... and then I... pushed you away, and... you fell over."  
“我们接吻了，”明日香替他说道，她的脸颊开始泛起红晕。 “我捂住你的鼻子，你无法呼吸，然后当我松手时，你对着我的脸咳嗽。”当她将双手从他身上抬起时，她的双手开始颤抖。 “然后……然后我……把你推开，然后……你就摔倒了。”

She put her hands on the edge of the mattress to support herself. It was that or flop to the ground: her legs were threatening to give out as she confessed her sin.  
她双手撑在床垫边缘支撑自己。要么就是这样，要么倒在地上：当她承认自己的罪孽时，她的双腿几乎要垮掉了。

"Your head hit the floor so hard... and then you weren't moving..." Asuka clenched her eyes shut. She felt something that might have been a tear try to force its way out, and she couldn't allow it.  
“你的头重重地撞到了地板上……然后你就一动不动了……”明日香紧紧闭上眼睛。她感觉到有一种可能是泪水的东西试图强行流出来，但她不允许它发生。

No crying. Not after what had happened a decade ago.  
没有哭。不是在十年前发生的事情之后。

Eventually, she managed to force the rest of the story out as well. It was made a little easier by the fact that she had already recounted the story twice, but also made much harder seeing that she was confessing to the victim. But finally, it was all in the open.  
最终，她也设法把故事的其余部分也说出来了。她已经把这个故事叙述了两遍，这让事情变得容易一些，但看到她向受害者坦白，这也让事情变得更加困难。但最后，一切都公开了。

"Asuka..." Shinji finally said after a minute of silence. "Did you... mean for me to fall over?"  
“明日香……”沉默了一分钟后，真嗣终于开口说道。 “你……是想让我摔倒吗？”

"What are you, stupid?" Asuka growled, then internally winced at what she had just said before continuing. "All I wanted to do was get your face away from mine after you practically spat in my mouth."  
“你是什么啊，笨蛋？”明日香咆哮了一声，然后因为自己刚才的话而内心皱起眉头，然后继续说道。 “在你几乎吐到我嘴里之后，我只想把你的脸从我的脸上移开。”

"So the fall was an accident, right?"  
“那么坠落是一次意外，对吗？”

She groaned in annoyance as her head drooped. "People do keep telling me that."  
她低下头，懊恼地呻吟了一声。 “人们确实一直这么告诉我。”

"Then why are you acting like it's all your fault?"  
“那你为什么表现得好像这一切都是你的错？”

"Because it damn well is!" Asuka exploded. Shinji flinched away from her, and she had to turn around and take a few steps away before she did something stupid. Again. After a few deep and calming breathes, she returned to the bedside and folded her arms. "Like I said before. _I_ provoked you into kissing me when you didn't want to. _I_ made you suffocate. _I pushed you_." She said the last line directly at Shinji's face. And then was surprised at just how calm he looked.  
“因为这实在太好了！”明日香爆炸了。真嗣退缩了，她不得不转身退开几步，才做出了傻事。再次。平静地深吸了几口气后，她回到床边，抱起双臂。 “就像我之前说的，我在你不愿意的时候挑衅你吻我。我让你窒息。我推了你。”她直接对着真嗣的脸说出了最后一句话。然后惊讶于他看起来如此平静。

"Asuka." The boy cautiously raised a hand, hovering it just near her elbow as if he was afraid that touching her would instantly burn it off. Eventually he got the courage up to make contact. "From now on, I'm going to say this as many times as I need to: I don't blame you. It was an accident."  
“明日香。”男孩小心翼翼地举起一只手，悬在她的肘部附近，仿佛生怕一触碰她的手就会立刻被烧掉。终于，他鼓起勇气联系了。 “从现在开始，我会根据需要多次说这句话：我不怪你。这是一个意外。”

"Not you too..." Asuka loudly groaned. She closed her eyes and sighed. "You're too damn nice, Third Child. Only you wouldn't hold a grudge against somebody who put you in hospital."  
“你也不是……”明日香大声呻吟。她闭上眼睛，叹了口气。 “老三，你太好了，只是你不会对送你住院的人怀恨在心。”

"The only thing to blame is whatever I slipped on," Shinji stated.  
“唯一应该责怪的是我滑倒的东西，”真嗣说。

"That'd be your stupid outdated music player," Asuka provided.  
“那是你愚蠢的过时音乐播放器，”明日香补充道。

"Then my SDAT has earned some time in the naughty corner."  
“那么我的 SDAT 在顽皮的角落里赢得了一些时间。”

She _tried_ to keep it stifled. She _tried_ not to let her reaction to such a silly punishment for an inanimate object show. But Asuka found she was helpless to stop the corners of her mouth from twitching upwards. And equally helpless to keep down the chuckle that escaped her lips.  
她试图压抑它。她试图不让自己对对无生命物体进行如此愚蠢的惩罚的反应表现出来。但明日香却发现自己无法阻止嘴角上扬。同样无法抑制从唇间溢出的笑声。

"Oh, _mein Gott_," Asuka mumbled as soon as she got herself back under control. She vigorously shook her head to try and clear it. "Anyway. Everybody can keep saying that it was an accident, but I still feel guilty. Until I do something as an apology, that feeling won't go away."  
“哦，我的天哪，”明日香一恢复控制就咕哝道。她用力摇摇头，试图澄清这一点。 “不管怎样。每个人都可以一直说这是一次意外，但我仍然感到内疚。除非我做出道歉的事情，否则这种感觉不会消失。”

Shinji began to speak, but she held up a hand. "Don't even say that I don't have to. I'm _going_ to do something, and even an Angel wouldn't be able to stop me. Besides, more happened last night than you getting hurt, in a way."  
真嗣开始说话，但她举起了一只手。 “别说我不必，我要做点什么，就算是天使也无法阻止我。而且，从某种程度上来说，昨晚发生的事情比你受伤还要多。” ”

Now the poor boy was staring confusedly up at her. Asuka ran a hand through her hair as she tried to put the right words together. "Shinji... I stole something from you." The confused look only grew larger. "Misato told me something important that I _am_ completely guilty of."  
现在这个可怜的男孩困惑地抬头看着她。明日香用手梳理着头发，试图拼出正确的词语。 “真嗣……我偷了你的东西。”困惑的表情只会变得更大。 “美里告诉了我一些重要的事情，我对此感到非常内疚。”

Shinji nervously cleared his throat."Whatever it is, you can just give it back, I'm su-"  
真嗣紧张地清了清喉咙。“不管是什么，你都可以把它还给我，我很——”

"It's not something physical," interrupted Asuka. "Misato said that I stole your first kiss, and on top of that made it incredibly horrible for you."  
“这不是物理上的东西，”明日香打断道。 “美里说我偷走了你的初吻，而且这对你来说非常可怕。”

"O-... oh..." The confusion lifted from his face. "W-well, it's fine, I guess. You don't need to make up for something so minor..."  
“噢——噢……”他脸上的困惑消失了。 「呃、呃，我想没关系。你不需要为了这种小事去弥补……」

"Minor?!" Asuka stalked over to the window in frustration. "A first kiss is important. It's supposed to _mean something._ With some_one_ important. All yours means is that I hurt you." She whirled around. "I need to fix what I did."  
“次要的？！”明日香沮丧地走到窗前。 “初吻很重要。它应该意味着什么。和重要的人。你的一切意味着我伤害了你。”她转过身来。 “我需要纠正我所做的事情。”

Shinji gulped as she slowly walked back towards his head. "Thir-... Shinji," she nervously began. "I'm going to make it up to you, the only way I possibly can."  
真嗣咽了口口水，慢慢地朝他的头走去。 “三……真嗣，”她紧张地说道。 “我会弥补你的，这是我唯一能做的。”

"Asuka... what are you-" Shinji faltered as Asuka leaned in close.  
“明日香……你在做什么——”真嗣在明日香靠近时结结巴巴。

"I'm calling for a do-over."  
“我要求重来一次。”

"Oh... um..." “哦……嗯……”

"But before I do..." Asuka stood up straight. Was that disappointment in his eyes? She focused her gaze on him. "I need to know something first: why didn't you do anything the first time?"  
“但在我这样做之前……”明日香站直了身子。他眼中的那是失望吗？她将目光集中在他身上。 “我首先需要知道一件事：为什么你第一次不采取任何行动？”

Utter confusion returned to Shinji's face. "Why didn't I... what?"  
真嗣的脸上再次出现了彻底的困惑。 “为什么我没有……什么？”

"You just stood there like a log. Kissing doesn't involve just standing around. There are other elements." '_You didn't even hold me.'_  
“你就像一根木头一样站在那里。接吻并不只是站在那里。还有其他因素。” “你甚至没有抱过我。”

"Oh!" Realisation dawned, followed by embarrassment that flooded the boy's cheeks with redness. "You... um... you decided to kiss me. Completely out of nowhere. I was still trying to work out if I was dreaming!" He brought up a hand to nervously rub the back of his head, but halted as soon as a finger brushed the bandage. "And then you _actually kissed me!_ My brain just gave up and shut down!"  
“哦！”男孩恍然大悟，随后感到尴尬，脸颊泛红。 “你……嗯……你决定吻我。完全出于某种原因。我还在想知道我是不是在做梦！”他抬起手，紧张地揉着后脑勺，但手指刚擦过绷带就停了下来。 “然后你真的吻了我！我的大脑就放弃了并关闭了！”

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Was I really _that_ amazing?" she asked sarcastically.  
明日香扬起一边眉毛。 “我真的有那么厉害吗？”她讽刺地问道。

"Yeah!" “是的！”

She blinked. He blinked. They both stared at each other in complete shock at what Shinji had just uttered. Asuka had not been expecting _that_ kind of response.  
她眨了眨眼。他眨了眨眼睛。两人对视一眼，都被真嗣的话震惊了。明日香没想到会得到这样的回应。

Shinji recovered first. "I mean... um..." Sort of.  
真嗣最先恢复过来。 “我的意思是……嗯……”有点像。

Asuka's arms dropped to her sides. "W-well then," she stammered, glancing away and trying to fight down her blush, before she managed to rally. "I mean, of course I am! I'm the Great Asuka Langley-Soryu!" Before Shinji could respond, she pointed an imperious finger at him. "And you are the Invincible Shinji Ikari."  
明日香的手臂垂到身体两侧。 “呃——那么，”她结结巴巴地说，目光移开，试图压下脸红，然后才恢复过来。 “我的意思是，我当然是！我是伟大的明日香·兰格利·苍流！”还没等真嗣反应过来，她就用一根专横的手指指着他。 “而你，就是无敌碇真嗣。”

The words seemed to be coming from nowhere now. There was no way she could possibly have had time to come up with them before they were fired out of her mouth.  
现在这句话似乎不知从何而来。在它们被从她嘴里喷出来之前，她不可能有时间想出它们。

"I hereby declare a do-over of our kiss. Plus, as a fellow Evangelion pilot, as my housemate, as m-my," she verbally stumbled a little, "my _friend,_ and as somebody I feel I can trust, I decree that you are allowed to touch my person." She stopped to glare at him, masking her surprise at what she had just decided to allow. "But no funny business. Got it?"  
“我特此宣布我们的吻重来一次。另外，作为新世纪福音战士的飞行员，作为我的室友，作为我，我的，”她的言语有点结巴，“我的朋友，作为我觉得可以信任的人，我颁布法令，允许你触摸我的身体。”她停下来瞪着他，掩饰自己对自己刚刚决定允许的事情的惊讶。 “但没什么好笑的。明白了吗？”

On the plus side, it meant that Shinji had practically been given a clear instruction.  
从好的方面来说，这意味着真嗣实际上已经得到了明确的指示。

Hopefully he understood that.  
希望他明白这一点。

At Shinji's hesitant nod, Asuka let out a breath she hadn't been aware she had been holding. She stepped closer to the bed and, for the third time, stopped him from sitting up. Placing an arm on either side of him, she leaned over the boy and stared down at his furiously blushing face.  
真嗣迟疑地点点头，明日香不自觉地呼出了一口气。她靠近床边，第三次阻止他坐起来。她将一只手臂放在他的两侧，俯身在男孩身上，低头盯着他涨红的脸。

"Pucker up," she ordered as the distance between their faces began to shrink.  
“撅起嘴，”当他们的脸之间的距离开始缩小时，她命令道。

Their lips were almost touching when Shinji said, "A-Asuka?"  
当真嗣说：“明、明日香？”时，他们的嘴唇几乎要碰在一起了。

She halted her descent. "What?"  
她停止了下降。 “什么？”

"Did you brush your teeth?"  
“你刷牙了吗？”

Was he _grinning_ at her? Asuka stared incredulously down at him for a moment, then sighed.  
他正在对她微笑吗？明日香难以置信地盯着他看了一会儿，然后叹了口气。

"Smartass." “自作聪明。”

Their lips met. 他们的嘴唇相遇了。

Unlike the disaster of their first attempt, Asuka could sense right away that Shinji was actually getting into the act this time. Asuka could think of nothing else but the point where their lips touched, but a niggling thought reminded her that there was still something missing, so she reluctantly broke the kiss off after much too little time had passed.  
与第一次尝试的灾难不同，明日香立刻就感觉到真嗣这次真的开始行动了。明日香脑子里除了他们嘴唇接触的那一点之外什么也想不到，但一个琐碎的念头提醒她还缺少一些东西，所以她在过了太短的时间后才不情愿地结束了这个吻。

"Whoah..." Shinji looked about as dazed as she felt.  
“哇啊……”真嗣看起来和她一样茫然。

"That was... better," said Asuka. "But you're forgetting something."  
“这样……更好了，”明日香说。 “但是你忘了一件事。”

"Forg- Oh." The boy blushed and glanced away. "Sorry, I wasn't sure what I should do."  
“伪造——哦。”男孩脸红了，移开了视线。 “抱歉，我不确定我应该做什么。”

"Like I said before, you may touch me," she reminded him, "but no going for the goods. Absolutely anything else is fine."  
“就像我之前说的，你可以碰我，”她提醒他，“但不要去拿东西。绝对任何其他都可以。”

Asuka leaned in to try again, but a single word from Shinji halted her.  
明日香倾身想要再次尝试，但真嗣的一句话却让她停了下来。

"Wait." “等待。”

They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, before Shinji suddenly closed his eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again. Asuka suppressed a shiver; his eyes were filled with determination.  
他们对视了仿佛永恒，然后真嗣突然闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气，然后再次睁开。明日香抑制住颤抖。他的眼神充满了决心。

"Alright," he said. "I'm ready."  
“好吧，”他说。 “我准备好了。”

He reached a hand up and cupped the back of Asuka's head. His other hand snaked towards her abdomen, and she bit down a reflexive angry retort as the questing hand settled gently on her waist.  
他伸出一只手，捧住明日香的后脑勺。他的另一只手蜿蜒地伸向她的腹部，当那只探索的手轻轻地放在她的腰上时，她本能地愤怒地反驳了一句。

And then, with only a slight amount of pressure, Shinji pulled her down to meet him until their lips brushed against each other. He smiled, and she could literally _feel_ it.  
然后，只用了一点点压力，真嗣就把她拉下来迎向他，直到他们的嘴唇擦到了一起。他笑了，她真的能感觉到。

Their lips met again, and the world ceased to exist.  
他们的嘴唇再次相遇，世界不复存在。

At least, that was how Asuka felt.  
至少，明日香是这么觉得的。

A flash of light illuminated the room for a split second, and it took Asuka several seconds to work out that it had _not_ been because of the kiss. Some confused noises came from both teenagers as they realised that something had interrupted them. Asuka turned her head to the door, ready to unleash some Teutonic fury on the orderly that had dared to interfere...  
一道闪光瞬间照亮了房间，明日香过了好几秒才意识到这不是因为那个吻。两个少年都发出了一些困惑的声音，因为他们意识到有什么东西打扰了他们。明日香把头转向门口，准备向敢于干涉的勤务兵发泄条顿人的愤怒……

...Only to see Misato's hideously smug grin beneath a small camera peeking through the open door.  
......只看到美里在一个小摄像机下从敞开的门里偷看，露出可怕的自鸣得意的笑容。

Asuka blinked slowly. "Misato..." she began in a low, dangerous tone.  
明日香缓缓眨了眨眼睛。 “美里……”她用低沉而危险的语气说道。

"Yes?" Their guardian's voice was sickeningly sweet and innocent, as if she hadn't just been caught.  
“是的？”他们的监护人的声音甜美得令人作呕，天真无邪，仿佛她不是刚刚被抓住的。

"_Gib mir die gottverdammte Kamera!"_  
“把那该死的相机给我！”

The Second Child surged over the bed, deftly avoiding the chair on the other side as her feet hit the floor again. She bolted for the door, but Misato was already fleeing down the hall. Fortunately, all Asuka had to do was follow the sound of a cackling madwoman.  
老二从床上一跃而过，双脚再次落地，巧妙地避开了另一边的椅子。她冲向门口，但美里已经沿着走廊逃走了。幸运的是，明日香所要做的就是跟随一个疯女人的咯咯笑声。

"_Komm sofort zurück! Ich mach dich kalt!"_  
“你快回来！我杀了你！”

---

"So I eventually tracked her down, cornered her, and demanded the film. She refused, I threatened violence, she teased me, I threatened _more_ violence, then I distracted her by claiming Kaji was nearby and grabbed the camera. Misato got all pouty until I explained that I wanted to develop that picture she'd just taken. That's when she offered to get it done up perfectly, but only if she got a copy as well. So now there's an identical picture and frame somewhere in her new house, and she's probably telling Kaji the same story."  
“所以我最终找到了她，把她逼到绝境，并要求拍摄这部电影。她拒绝了，我威胁使用暴力，她取笑我，我威胁要施加更多暴力，然后我声称加持就在附近，并抢走了相机，分散了她的注意力。美里撅起了嘴。直到我解释说我想冲洗她刚刚拍的那张照片时，她提出要完美地完成它，但前提是她也能得到一份副本，所以现在她的新房子里有一张相同的照片和相框。 ，她可能也在给加持讲同样的故事。”

"Wow," remarked Shinji, looking up from the image of possibly the most amazing moment in his life. It had been taken with a cheap, disposable camera, but evidently some science -or maybe magic- had been involved to make it look as clear and perfect as possible. He gently sat the picture back down on the mantelpiece and headed back to the sofa, where he sat down and put his arm around the girl of his dreams.  
“哇，”真嗣从可能是他一生中最奇妙时刻的照片中抬起头说道。它是用廉价的一次性相机拍摄的，但显然涉及到一些科学——或者可能是魔法——使它看起来尽可能清晰和完美。他轻轻地将照片放回壁炉架上，然后走回沙发，坐下来，用手臂搂住他梦中的女孩。

"Wait, didn't you say that Misato had gone back home?" he asked as a thought occurred.  
“等等，你不是说美里回家了吗？”他边思考边问道。

"I don't think she ever mentioned actually going _home_," replied Asuka as she snuggled into his side. "But she'd apparently walked back to Kaji's car and tried to fall asleep in the passenger seat. It was too uncomfortable though, so she gave up and came back here to try and find Kaji. And ended up seeing... well... us."  
“我认为她从来没有提到过要回家，”明日香依偎在他身边回答道。 “但她显然是走回加持的车里，试图在乘客座位上睡着。不过这太不舒服了，所以她放弃了，回到这里试图找到加持。最后却看到了……好吧。” .. 我们。”

"Ah." “啊。”

The two of them fell into a comfortable silence for a while, until Asuka spoke up again.  
两人陷入了一段舒适的沉默，直到明日香再次开口。

"So now that the Angel War is over, what are you planning to do?" she inquired.  
“那么现在天使战争结束了，你打算做什么？”她询问道。

"I haven't decided yet," Shinji admitted. "There's still the rest of high school to go, anyway."  
“我还没决定。”真嗣承认道。 “无论如何，高中还剩下最后一段时间。”

"Ugh." The redhead rolled her eyes. "I already have the damn education. Only reason I'm still going to that school is because of Hikari. Oh, and you of course," she added almost as an afterthought, but there was humour in her voice that made Shinji chuckle and gently squeeze her.  
“啊。”红发翻了个白眼。 “我已经受过该死的教育了。我仍然去那所学校的唯一原因是因为光。哦，当然还有你，”她几乎是事后补充道，但她声音中的幽默让真嗣咯咯地笑了，轻轻地挤压她。

"But have you decided what you're going to do afterwards?" asked Shinji. "You've already got a degree, are you going to use it to get a job?"  
“但是你决定好之后要做什么了吗？”真嗣问道。 “你已经拿到了学位，你打算用它来找工作吗？”

Asuka thought for a moment, then shook her head. "Nah, that degree was pretty much purely to improve my worth as an Eva pilot and to show that I could get one at such a young age. I'll probably get another one. Something I'll actually give a crap about now."  
明日香想了一会儿，然后摇了摇头。 “不，那个学位纯粹是为了提高我作为一名 Eva 飞行员的价值，并表明我可以在这么年轻的时候获得一个学位。我可能会获得另一个学位。我现在真的不在乎了。 ”

She pulled away from the embrace a little and gazed at Shinji. When he turned a curious look upon her, she added, "Why don't I see if there's something we'll both enjoy? It'd certainly be more interesting if we're both in the same classes. We could even end up getting a job at the same place."  
她稍稍从怀抱中挣脱开来，凝视着真嗣。当他好奇地看着她时，她补充道：“我为什么不看看有没有我们都喜欢的东西呢？如果我们都在同一个班级，那肯定会更有趣。我们甚至可能会成为这样的人。”在同一个地方找到工作。”

Shinji smiled. "I'll leave that up to you. Whatever you pick, I'll be happy to follow along."  
真嗣笑了。 “我会把这件事留给你。无论你选择什么，我都会很乐意跟随。”

"Oh good! I was thinking of moving to America and becoming a talk show host. You can be the musical and comedy relief." Mischief glinted in her eyes as his own began to widen. "You dummy. It's going to be something we're _both_ legitimately interested in."  
“哦，太好了！我正在考虑搬到美国，成为一名脱口秀主持人。你可以成为音乐剧和喜剧的替补。”当他的眼睛开始睁大时，她的眼睛里闪烁着恶作剧的光芒。 “你这个傻瓜。这将是我们双方都感兴趣的事情。”

The doorbell interrupted their conversation, and Asuka reluctantly got up to see who it was. The security front door slid open as she palmed the release, and a bored-looking deliveryman stared back at her.  
门铃打断了他们的谈话，明日香不情愿地起身看看是谁。当她按下开关时，安全前门滑开了，一名一脸无聊的送货员盯着她。

"Shinji Katsuragi?" he asked. "I have a parcel that requires a signature."  
“葛城真司？”他问。 “我有一个包裹需要签名。”

"He's my boyfriend," Asuka replied.  
“他是我的男朋友。”明日香回答道。

"Good enough. Sign here."  
“够了。在这里签名。”

She scribbled on the digital pad he held out to her, then took the parcel and stepped back into Misato's old apartment.  
她在他递给她的数字本上写下了一些内容，然后拿着包裹，回到了美里的旧公寓。

"It's from Rei," she called out as she read the details on the parcel. "Looks like another of her round-the-world trip videos."  
“这是丽寄来的，”她读着包裹上的详细信息时喊道。 “看起来像是她的另一个环球旅行视频。”

"Oh? Where did she go this time?" Shinji wondered as she sat back down next to him on the couch.  
“哦？她这次去哪儿了？”真嗣一边想，一边在沙发上坐回他身边。

"...Huh. Germany." Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Damn, she should have said something, I could have told her about some really nice places."  
“……呃。德国。”明日香扬起一边眉毛。 “该死，她应该说点什么，我本可以告诉她一些非常好的地方。”

"You wanna watch it now?"  
“你现在想看吗？”

"Nah, I'll put it on after dinner." She placed the video cassette on the coffee table. "For now, I've got something better in mind."  
“嗯，吃完饭我再穿上。”她把录像带放在咖啡桌上。 “现在，我心里有更好的想法。”

"What's that?" “那是什么？”

Asuka grinned deviously. "Shinji, do you wanna kiss me?"  
明日香露出狡猾的笑容。 “慎二，你想吻我吗？”

**A/N:** This is a one-shot idea I came up with quite a while ago. My take on the infamous kiss scene that has been used so much as a 'For Want of a Nail' scenario. I'm not writing the knock-on effects for the entire rest of the Evangelion series, because other people have done them much better than I could.  
A/N：这是我很久以前想到的一个一次性想法。我对臭名昭著的吻戏的看法，这个吻戏被用作“缺钉子”的场景。我不会为《新世纪福音战士》系列的其余部分写连锁反应，因为其他人做得比我好得多。

Thanks go to Gryphon for the title of this piece, since I'm terrible at coming up with names for things.  
感谢 Gryphon 给这篇文章起的标题，因为我不擅长为事物起名字。

### Comment
[NaisuAisu](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5842237/NaisuAisu): This has to probably be one of my favorite ways the scene was used. Honestly, I'm not sure which style I'd like better, your regret-into-love or Strygipia/ Advice and Trust's perfect kiss. Kudos to you, Halt.  
这大概是我最喜欢这个场景被运用的一种方式了。老实说，我不确定我更喜欢哪种风格，是你的从悔恨到爱，还是 Strygipia/ Advice and Trust 的完美之吻。向你致敬，Halt。

[AngelNo13Bardiel](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/564293/AngelNo13Bardiel): Aww...now that was just plain nice. Sweet, and just dramatic enough. Definitely better than my attempt at altering that scene, anyway.  
哎呀...这真是太好了。甜蜜，而且恰到好处的戏剧性。无论如何，肯定比我自己尝试修改那个场景要好得多。

MADMAN: Another loser who can't accept what they saw on screen, so you turn it all into something for all the homophobic kids to flap off to. Pitiful.  
又一个无法接受屏幕上所见而将其扭曲成迎合恐同孩子们口味的失败者。可悲。

[jcmoorehead](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/957082/jcmoorehead): Can't believe I haven't seen this before. I really enjoyed reading this, it's always lovely to see the different ideas and takes people have on that case scene and how things can change as a result of it playing out differently. I thought your take was very well executed, you could feel the genuine emotion from it and you got Asuka down perfectly. Loved the little section afterwards too.
真不敢相信我之前竟然没看过这个。我真的很享受阅读它，总是很高兴看到人们对那个案件场景有不同的想法和解读，以及事情会因此如何变化。我觉得你的处理非常到位，能感受到其中的真挚情感，而且你对明日香的刻画也恰到好处。也很喜欢后面的小部分。

[COBRASTEVE](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2138144/COBRASTEVE): WOW! That was wonderful. You have the characters personalities just right. I could almost see Asuka! A great story line...and she calls him boyfriend, how good is that?  
哇！真是太棒了。你对角色的性格把握得恰到好处。我几乎能想象出明日香的样子！故事情节很精彩...而且她还叫他男朋友，真是太甜了！

[Sailor Star Dust 1](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/421646/Sailor-Star-Dust-1): You reviewed a story of mine ages ago, so I wanted to return the favor. I certainly wasn't expecting that happy ending (Shinji officially adopted by Misato / Kaji I hope?) but holy crap I wish the episode could've gone something like this. Thanks so much for writing, it warmed my heart on a slightly gloomy night.
你很久以前评论过我的一篇故事，所以我想回礼。我当然没料到会是那样幸福的结局（真嗣正式被美里/我希望能是加持收养？）但天哪，我真希望那一集能这样发展。非常感谢你写作，在一个略显阴沉的夜晚温暖了我的心。

Annk:
Hi!  嗨！  
  
Oh, how I love returning this story again and again! The way the small butterfly effect of something so innocuous has such incredible ramifications! Poor Shinji, what he goes through for a kiss... but I know he's happy for it! Misato's talk with Asuka is also so sweet! Reprimanding, but encouraging in a very Misato-like way, I absolutely adored the moment of realization.  
哦，我多么喜欢一遍又一遍地重温这个故事！那种看似无害的小蝴蝶效应竟然产生了如此惊人的影响！可怜的真嗣，为了一个吻经历了那么多……但我知道他因此感到幸福！美里与明日香的对话也那么温馨！既有责备，又以美里特有的方式给予鼓励，那一刻的领悟我真是太喜欢了。  
  
And what's to be said about that ending, except that it's simply beautiful?! I truly love your stories and the way they feed the reader's soul with this invigorating air of hope and wholesomeness, and this oneshot stands out to me as one of my favorites!  
至于那个结尾，除了说它美得令人心醉，还能说什么呢？我真心喜爱你的故事，它们以这种充满希望和完整感的清新气息滋养着读者的灵魂，这篇短篇对我来说尤为特别，是我最喜欢的之一！  
  
Thank you so much for your work! And thank you for this great story!  
非常感谢您的工作！以及这个精彩的故事！

[DeadUser1](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15081590/DeadUser1): Wholesome and tense. I didn't expect it to end this way but I am glad it did. It was really nice and well presented. Nice oneshot, hopefully you do many more. Also, Misato literally caught them in 4k, that was pretty funny.  
温馨又紧张。没想到会以这种方式结束，但我很高兴它这样结束了。真的很不错，呈现得很好。期待你写更多这样的短篇。另外，美里居然用 4K 画质抓住了他们，真是太搞笑了。
