This takes place during the alternate reality that Shinji created in episode 26. The one where Rei actually spoke like a normal girl and said things that I never expected to come out of her mouth... *shakes head* For now, this is just a WAFFy one shot with Shinji/Asuka, but maybe I can continue with it if I want to later.  
这发生在真嗣在第 26 集创造的另一个现实中，那里零号机真的像一个普通女孩那样说话，说出了我从未期待会从她嘴里听到的话... *摇头* 目前，这只是真嗣/明日香之间温馨的一幕，但如果我愿意，以后也许会继续发展。

On with the show! 继续演出吧！

**A Beautiful Day for Piggyback Rides**By: Karina Kineshi (coronaflare )  
背上的美好一天作者：Karina Kineshi（coronaflare）

Late! Late!  迟了！迟了！

I didn't know whether to pound on the door or just give it a simple tap. If I had done the former, Mr. Ikari would have come out here and busted my ass before he realized who I was. But then again, there was the threat of knocking so quietly no one would hear me. It's amazing that no matter how many times I stand in front of this very door, I have no idea how to act.  
我不知道是该用力敲门还是轻轻敲一下。如果我选择前者，碇先生可能会冲出来先把我训一顿，然后才认出我是谁。但另一方面，如果敲得太轻，可能根本没人听见。真奇怪，不管我站在这扇门前多少次，我都不知道该怎么应对。

Shinji's parents, namely his dad, were more partial to voices than to knocking on the door. I thought of a better approach. "Hello? Can I come—"  
真嗣的父母，特别是他爸爸，更喜欢听到声音而不是敲门声。我想到了一个更好的办法。“你好？我可以进来吗—”

The door whipped open before I could finish my sentence, and I was left standing there with my fist raised in midair and hovering in front of my face, ready to knock. All the blood drained to my feet when I beheld the impressive height of Gendo Ikari filling the doorway. "Yes?"  
我还没说完话，门就猛地打开了，我举着拳头悬在半空，正准备敲门。当我看到源渡高大的身影堵在门口时，所有的血液仿佛都涌到了脚底。"什么事？"

Can this man ever greet me like I wasn't some door-to-door toilet salesman? Just once? Or does he forget my name when I go to his apartment every single day? I like to think of myself as a person who is normally unshaken, but in this man's presence... I felt myself becoming unraveled. "I... well... Shinji..."  
这个人就不能像对待普通人一样跟我打招呼吗？哪怕一次也好？还是说他每次我去他公寓时都忘了我的名字？我自认为是个不易动摇的人，但在这个男人面前……我感觉自己开始崩溃了。"我……呃……真嗣……"

He growled at me, a deep noise that rattled in the back of his throat. "Shinji is still—"  
他对我低吼一声，那声音深沉而颤抖，从喉咙深处传来。"真嗣他还没——"

"—dear, who is it?" Yui pushed her husband's hulk out of the doorway, at the same time wiping her hands on a teatowel. She smiled broadly when she saw me. "Asuka! Come in, come in..."  
"—亲爱的，是谁啊？" 绫波推开她丈夫那魁梧的身躯，从门口探出头来，同时用手中的茶巾擦了擦手。看到我时，她露出了灿烂的笑容。"明日香！快进来，快进来……"

I heaved a sigh of relief when Gendo gave me a once over before striding back to the kitchen table, no doubt going back to reading the stock market profiles in the newspaper. Yui winked at me and directed me to Shinji's room. Well, not that I needed her to do so, but she did it anyways. "Thank you," I said.  
当源堂上下打量了我一番后，大步走回厨房桌边，无疑是要继续阅读报纸上的股市分析，我这才松了一口气。绫波对我眨了眨眼，示意我去真嗣的房间。其实我并不需要她指路，但她还是这么做了。"谢谢你，"我说道。

"You're welcome." "不客气。"

We assumed an unspoken communication that went something along of the lines of me thanking her for saving me from her husband. She said with her eyes that she knew how intimidating her husband could be to children (even though he really wasn't once you got to know him, she said) and that it was her job to save all people who knock on the door of room 317.  
我们之间有一种不言而喻的交流，大致是我感谢她从她丈夫那里救了我。她用眼神告诉我，她知道她丈夫对孩子们来说有多么可怕（尽管她说，一旦你了解他，他其实并不可怕），而拯救所有敲响 317 号房门的人是她的职责。

Why did that man hate me so much, anyways? Is it just me? Or does he treat everyone like that? Maybe I'm going overboard. I had known the family for a long time, was best friends with Shinji and a favorite of Shinji's mother, but Shinji's father? I shrugged and chalked it up as one of life's eternal mysteries.  
那个男人为什么那么讨厌我呢？只是针对我吗？还是他对每个人都这样？也许我反应过度了。我认识这个家庭很久了，和真嗣是好朋友，也是真嗣母亲的最爱，但真嗣的父亲呢？我耸了耸肩，将其归结为生活中永恒的谜团之一。

"Shinji? Are you awake?" “真嗣？你醒了吗？”

What a stupid question to ask. I don't think being snuggled in your covers with your eyes closed counted as being awake. I looked around to see if he had changed anything since yesterday. Same penguin bobblehead figurine... same prudish sense of tidiness. Other than a box of mangorind candy on the floor, nothing was out of place.  
问这种蠢问题。我觉得蜷缩在被窝里闭着眼睛不算醒着。我环顾四周，看他自昨天以来有没有改变什么。还是那个企鹅摇头玩偶...还是那种过分整洁的感觉。除了地上的一盒芒果青糖果，一切如常。

That's my mangorind candy, damn you!  
那可是我的芒果青糖果，你这家伙！

He must have stolen it from me, the little punk. Or wait... I think I gave it to him... oh well. I picked the box up off the floor and put it on his desktop. After a moment's hesitation, I took that same box and put it in my lunchbag. I'd have dessert today...  
他肯定是偷了我的，这小混蛋。等等...我好像给过他...算了。我捡起地上的盒子放在他的桌面上。犹豫片刻后，我又拿起那盒糖果放进我的午餐袋。今天有甜点了...

Of course, I'll share. Maybe.  
当然，我会分享。可能吧。

Shinji turned over in his sleep, eyebrows close together and a slight scowl on his face. "Hey Shinji?" If he was having a bad dream, I guess the thing to do would be to wake him. I leaned in closer, not really deciding on the best way to handle this. I kept on moving closer to his face when I realized just how close I was.  
真嗣在睡梦中翻了个身，眉头紧锁，脸上带着一丝不悦。“嘿，真嗣？”如果他正在做噩梦，我想应该叫醒他。我俯身靠近，并没有真正决定最好的处理方式。当我意识到自己有多近时，我还在继续靠近他的脸。

C'mon, I had been this close before, and sometimes even closer. We were old friends, there wasn't a thing I knew about me that he didn't. I was comfortable enough to be really physically close to him without feeling guilt or that sense of longing between a man and a woman. I didn't have that at all.  
拜托，我以前也这么近过，甚至有时候更近。我们是老朋友了，我了解的关于我的一切，他也都了解。我可以很自在地与他身体上非常接近，而不会感到内疚或男女之间的那种渴望。我完全没有那种感觉。

It was okay in grade school, everyone knew that Shinji and Asuka were just friends. Just platonic. It wasn't out of the ordinary to have a girl as your best friend, or vice versa. However, that all changed when we entered intermediary school. Suddenly, hanging out with a girl meant that you had her "in the sack".  
小学时还好，大家都知道真嗣和明日香只是朋友。纯友谊。有个女生做你最好的朋友，或者反之，这并不稀奇。然而，当我们进入中学后，一切都变了。突然间，和女生一起玩就意味着你已经和她有了某种关系。

I shuddered at the assumption. We were just friends, and it's strange when someone tries to tell us otherwise. I could hear Touji's voice echoing in my head, asking why in the world Shinji and I hadn't gone on a date already. Shinji and I looked at him like he was crazy, and then we walked back to class. Together.  
我听到这种假设就感到不寒而栗。我们只是朋友，当有人试图告诉我们不是这样时，感觉很奇怪。我能听到东治的声音在我脑海中回响，问我们为什么还没有一起去约会。真嗣和我像看疯子一样看着他，然后我们一起走回教室。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

I felt his soft breathing on my face, and my eyelids drooped as I stared at him. Boyish, not incredibly handsome, but above average. The innocence was the trait that endeared him most to the girls of my class. Oddly enough, no one had ever asked him for a date because they always assumed that I was his girlfriend.  
我感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过我的脸庞，凝视着他，我的眼皮渐渐沉重。他带着少年的稚气，虽非绝世美男，却也颇为出众。那份纯真，最是让班上的女生们倾心。说来奇怪，从未有人向他表白，只因大家都默认我是他的女友。

Which I certainly was not.  
而我当然不是。

I remember seeing this same childlike face playing in the sandbox the day that we met. He was playing all by himself, patting down sand in an attempt to build a mound. The boys' consensus was that he was too wimpy and didn't like playing rough boy sports like wrestling. The girls whispered amongst themselves that his father was a very powerful trading tycoon, and whoever angered Shinji would be struck down by the wrath of God.  
我记得初次遇见那天，他那张童真的脸庞在沙坑中独自玩耍。他正努力拍实沙子，试图堆起一个小丘。男孩们一致认为他太过柔弱，不喜欢摔跤这类粗犷的男孩运动。女孩们则窃窃私语，说他的父亲是位权势滔天的贸易大亨，谁要是惹恼了真嗣，必将遭受天谴。

I said they were all airheads.  
我说他们都是些没脑子的人。

None of them had even bothered to talk to the boy before, so how did they know? My family and I had just moved here from Hamburg, Germany. While getting to know everyone in my elementary school was no easy task, I found myself being drawn to the silent boy with the sad, expressive eyes. The one who wasn't afraid to play by himself.  
他们之前甚至都没费心和那个男孩说过话，又怎么知道呢？我和我的家人刚从德国汉堡搬到这里。虽然要认识小学里的每个人并不容易，但我发现自己被那个有着悲伤而富有表现力眼睛的沉默男孩吸引了。那个不怕独自玩耍的男孩。

"Asuka, be careful!" one of my friends named Megumi cautioned. "I hear that whenever someone talks to him, they turn up missing the next day."  
“明日香，小心点！”我的一个名叫惠的朋友警告说，“我听说每次有人和他说话，第二天就会失踪。”

I snorted at her and told my friends to watch me talk to him. In that burst of confidence only a second grader can possess, I sauntered over to the sandbox and set my foot on a wooden plank. Of course, I was scared, but I'd never admit it. I cleared my throat to get his attention. "Hi, I'm Asuka. Sohryu Asuka Langley. Pleased to meet you."  
我对她嗤之以鼻，并告诉我的朋友们看我怎么跟他搭话。凭借着只有二年级学生才有的那种瞬间自信，我大摇大摆地走向沙坑，一脚踩在一块木板上。当然，我心里害怕，但我绝不会承认。我清了清嗓子，以引起他的注意。“嗨，我是明日香。惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到你。”

The boy's head slowly lifted upwards, as if tearing his eyes away from his sand mound would somehow flatten it. "Are... are you talking to me?"  
男孩的头缓缓抬起，仿佛从沙堆上移开视线会让它塌陷似的。“你...你在跟我说话吗？”

"Who else would I be talking to, dummkopf?" I sneered. Almost immediately, I slapped my hand over my mouth when I said that German word. Mama always uttered it when my Dad says something stupid. Mama never gave me an explanation as to why I can't say it, but I know it's bad all the same.  
"“不然我还能跟谁说话，笨蛋？”我嘲讽道。话一出口，我立刻用手捂住了嘴巴，因为我用了那个德语词。妈妈总是在爸爸说蠢话时这么叫他。妈妈从没解释过为什么我不能说这个词，但我知道它肯定不好。”

"I don't know..." He looked puzzled. "What's that word you said?"  
"我不太清楚……" 他看起来有些困惑，"你刚才说的那个词是什么？"

"It's a bad word. I can't say it again." I said in a conspiratorial tone. "Mama might wash my mouth out with soap if I say it again."  
"那是个不好的词，我不能再说了。" 我压低声音，神秘兮兮地说，"如果我再说一遍，妈妈可能会用肥皂洗我的嘴。"

The boy blinked and nodded with me, eyes wide open. "Oh... right..." Parents could instill such fear in children, and we were no exception. I glanced around, frightened that somehow my Mama was watching me from somewhere. She said that she had eyes in the back of her head, and I wondered if she also had them in the school.  
男孩眨了眨眼，跟着我点了点头，眼睛睁得大大的。"哦……对……" 父母总能用这种方式让孩子感到害怕，我们也不例外。我环顾四周，生怕妈妈不知从哪儿冒出来监视我。她说她后脑勺长着眼睛，我不禁怀疑她是不是在学校也有眼线。

Once I was positive that she wasn't watching (I can't tell you how I knew), I asked him what he was doing. He said he was making a sand pile. I remarked that he does that all during recess, why didn't he play with the other boys? "... and you get dirty from the sand!" I added.  
"确定她没在看（我无法告诉你我是怎么知道的），我问他正在做什么。他说他在堆沙堆。我评论说，他整个课间都在这么做，为什么不和其他男孩一起玩呢？"... 而且你会弄得满身是沙！"我补充道。

Shinji said that the boys hurt him when he tries to play soccer, and plus he liked the feel of the sand between his fingers. He said like he felt like he was playing on the moon. My second grade mind was awestruck by the magnificence (or strangeness) of his words. Playing on the moon? Man... this kid really was weird.  
"真嗣说，当他试图踢足球时，那些男孩会伤害他，而且他喜欢手指间沙子的感觉。他说感觉自己像是在月球上玩耍。我二年级的心智被他话语中的壮丽（或奇异）所震撼。在月球上玩耍？天哪...这孩子真的很奇怪。

"C'mon, it's fun." 来吧，这很有趣。

I knelt down in the sand, cringing when the lace border on my dress got half submerged in the sand. But once I ran my fingers through the grit, I started to enjoy it. Mama would never let me join in such a messy pastime as playing in a sandbox, but I really didn't care at the moment. The sand felt really good, cool to the touch. "I bet I can build a bigger mountain than you can," I challenged.  
我跪在沙地上，当裙边蕾丝半浸入沙中时，我不禁皱了皱眉。但当我手指穿过沙粒，我开始享受起来。妈妈绝不会允许我参与如此脏乱的活动，比如在沙坑里玩耍，但那一刻我真的不在乎。沙子触感很好，凉凉的。“我打赌我能堆出比你更大的沙山，”我挑战道。

He smiled at me. "We'll see."  
他对我微笑。“我们拭目以待。”

Looking back, I was glad I took the time to know this boy. If I had taken everyone's advice and stayed away from him, I wonder where I would have ended up.  
回望过去，我很庆幸我花时间去了解这个男孩。如果我听从了所有人的建议，远离他，我真不知道自己会走到哪里。

A frying pan being slammed against the stove snapped me out of my reverie, and I found myself in a rather awkward position. I was hovering not an inch from Shinji face, just staring at him. I snapped back in horror. What if he woke up and saw me? What if he thought I was trying to kiss him?!  
平底锅猛地砸在炉灶上，将我从沉思中惊醒，我发现自己正处于一个相当尴尬的姿势。我悬在半空，离真嗣的脸不到一寸，只是盯着他。我惊恐地回过神来。万一他醒来看到我怎么办？万一他以为我想吻他怎么办？！

"Not that that'd be a bad idea..."  
“其实这主意也不坏……”

What did I just say?!  
我刚说了什么？！

"Argh! Stupid Shinji!" What I tried to pass off as an excuse for my closeness came out as blaming Shinji for it. His eyes snapped open, and I found myself without a plan. I put my arms on my hips and tried to act in command. "Wake up, stupid Shinji!"  
"啊！笨蛋真嗣！" 我试图用借口掩饰自己的亲近，结果却变成了责怪真嗣。他猛地睁开眼睛，我发现自己毫无计划。我双手叉腰，试图表现出指挥的样子。" 醒醒，笨蛋真嗣！"

If there's anyone who can mask uneasiness, it was me.  
如果说有谁能掩饰不安，那一定是我。

I watched him as he slowly turned his head and got his eyes to focus. "Oh, it's you Asuka."  
我看着他慢慢转过头，让视线聚焦。"哦，是你啊，明日香。"

I rolled my eyes. He was just like his father when it came to recognizing people. "Is that the best greeting you can give to your oldest childhood friend?" I come every day, endure that painful decision at the Ikari's door, put up with Gendo's scrutiny, and for what?  
"我翻了个白眼。他在识人方面跟他父亲一模一样。“这就是你给从小一起长大的老朋友最好的问候吗？”我每天都来，忍受在碇家门口那痛苦的抉择，忍受源堂的审视，这一切都是为了什么？”

Shinji pulled the covers around his face and turned over. "Thanks Asuka. Now let me get back to sleep."  
真嗣把被子拉到脸上，翻了个身。“谢谢你，明日香。现在让我继续睡吧。”

I fought the urge to smack the boy. "You're so lazy! You can't skip school... so get up already!" I grabbed a corner of his sheet and yanked it from his body, hoping to stir him from sleep.  
"我强忍着给那小子一巴掌的冲动。“你太懒了！不能逃学……所以快起床吧！”我抓住他床单的一角，猛地一扯，希望能把他从睡梦中唤醒。”

One part of Shinji was up bright and early.  
新的一天，真嗣的一部分早早地醒来了。

When I saw what I saw, I screamed. Never mind the fact that I've seen it before considering I wake him up every day, but still... I slapped him and screamed that he's such a horny moron. He shot back that it was morning and he couldn't help it. I dragged him to his feet and threw his uniform at him. "Put that on right now!" I demanded.  
当我看到那一幕时，我尖叫起来。别管我以前见过这场景，毕竟我每天都要叫他起床，但这次...我给了他一巴掌，尖叫着说他真是个色迷心窍的傻瓜。他反驳说这是早晨，他控制不住。我把他拽起来，把制服扔给他。“立刻给我穿上！”我命令道。

He still moved sluggishly, pulling the shirt over his head like a turtle coming out of its shell. "Asuka, you're so loud," he complained. There was only one thing to do to this remark. I slapped him again. That shut him up quickly. Once we had said goodbye to his parents, we bolted down the stairs and into the morning sun.  
他还是动作迟缓，像乌龟从壳里探出头一样把衬衫套在头上。“明日香，你太吵了，”他抱怨道。对此，只有一个办法。我又给了他一巴掌。这下他立刻安静了。告别了他的父母后，我们冲下楼梯，迎向早晨的阳光。

"Let's go!" "走吧！"

He scowled and started to run. The collar to his shirt was upturned so I quickly fixed it in mid stride. That's no easy task, but I could do it. Once he rubbed his cheek again and glared at me for making it, he slyly remarked, "It's not like you haven't see it before, lighten up Asuka."  
他皱着眉头开始奔跑。他的衬衫领子翻起来了，我便在跑动中迅速帮他整理好。这可不是件容易的事，但我能做到。有一次他再次蹭了蹭脸颊，然后因为我这么做而瞪了我一眼，狡黠地说：“又不是你没见过，放轻松点，明日香。”

My face turned bright red, but I kept it under control. True, but it's... weird. I mean, he's my best friend! "You just can't control yourself when I come to wake you up, can you?"  
我的脸顿时涨得通红，但还是控制住了。确实，但就是...感觉怪怪的。毕竟，他是我最好的朋友！“每次我来叫你起床，你就控制不住自己，对吧？”

"Don't get too big headed," was his retort.  
"别太自大了，"他反驳道。

I glared at him and continued running. After a brief pause in talking (he was pulling lint out of his shirt pocket), we started talking about any old thing that crossed our minds. "Isn't the sky beautiful today?"  
我瞪了他一眼，继续跑步。短暂的交谈中断后（他在从衬衫口袋里扯出绒毛），我们开始谈论任何脑海中闪过的琐事。"今天的天空不是很美吗？"

I snorted. "Christ Shinji, try to sound like a man..."  
我嗤之以鼻。"天哪，真嗣，试着像个男人一样说话……"

"At least I take time to enjoy life unlike you..."  
"至少我还懂得享受生活，不像你……"

"Enjoying life isn't an excuse to be late for school, you idiot."  
"享受生活不是你上学迟到的借口，你个笨蛋。"

He lightly punched me on the arm and I punched him back. We stared at each other and started laughing. Sort of an inside joke that I don't care to repeat. Shinji switched the topic. "I hear that there's a new girl coming to school today."  
他轻轻地在我手臂上打了一拳，我也回敬了他一拳。我们互相对视，然后笑了起来。这是一种我不想重复的内部笑话。真嗣转移了话题：“我听说今天学校要来一个新女生。”

New girl? Yeah, I heard about her yesterday. Our teacher announced that someone would be sitting in the vacant seat next to mine. Her name was Rei Ayanami, a transfer student who had migrated from the old capital. "Yeah, we're seeing a lot of new people nowadays since they moved the capital to here." We had no shortage of newcomers, our class was filled to capacity.  
新来的女生？嗯，我昨天听说了。老师宣布会有人坐在我旁边的空位上。她叫绫波丽，是从旧都转学过来的。\"是啊，自从首都迁到这里后，我们这里来了不少新人。\"我们班上新面孔络绎不绝，已经坐得满满当当了。

Shinji wasn't even listening to me. He looked into the sky and his face got dreamlike. "I sure hope she's cute."  
真嗣根本就没在听我说话。他望着天空，脸上露出梦幻般的表情。\"真希望她是个可爱的女生。\"

Don't ask why this comment pissed me off so much, but since that day I befriended him in the sandbox, he was slowly opening himself up to other people. Not that it was bad, of course, but he accepted mannerisms that seemed very out of character for him. For example, the old Shinji wouldn't have said that, he would have blushed just thinking about it.  
别问我为什么这句话让我这么生气，但从那天我们在沙坑里成为朋友开始，他渐渐地向其他人敞开了心扉。这当然不是坏事，但他接受了一些似乎与他性格不符的行为。比如，以前的真嗣绝不会这么说，他光是想到这种事就会脸红。

Was this my fault as a best friend?  
这是作为最好的朋友我的错吗？

Was I even his best friend anymore?  
我还能算是他最好的朋友吗？

In an attempt to show my displeasure, I cut in front of his stride and ran in front of him. He stumbled for a bit, arms flailing, as he tried to run on wobbly legs. I laughed and turned around. "I'm all the cute you'll ever need," I declared. It pleased me that he almost tripped. But...  
为了表达我的不满，我插到他的步伐前面，跑到他前面。他踉跄了一下，手臂挥舞着，试图用颤抖的双腿继续跑。我笑了起来，转过身说：“我就是你永远需要的可爱。”看到他差点摔倒，我感到很高兴。但是……

Before being blasted into a dizzying kaleidoscope of colors, I remember two quite well. A flash of light blue hair and outlandish red eyes. Something slammed into me with enough force to knock me to the ground. "Goddammit, what the hell?!" I was looking at that sky, the same one that Shinji said was gorgeous earlier.  
在被炸成一片令人目眩的色彩漩涡之前，我清晰记得两个画面。一抹亮蓝色的发丝和奇异的红色眼眸。有什么东西猛地撞向我，力道之大足以将我击倒在地。“该死，这到底是怎么回事？！”我望着那片天空，就是之前真嗣说很美的那片天空。

It was spinning. 它在旋转。

"Asuka!" In the time it took me to regain my senses, I felt two hands on my shoulders, shaking me. "Asuka, are you okay?"  
“明日香！”在我恢复意识的那一刻，我感觉到两只手搭在我的肩膀上，摇晃着我。“明日香，你没事吧？”

The sky spinning wasn't the worst of it though. My right ankle felt like it was just pounded by a meat tenderizer. Shinji shaking me like a rag doll didn't help matters much either. I shielded the sun with my hand and snapped, "Stop shaking me! I'm not dead!" I scowled and pulled down my skirt which had flown up while I got knocked down. "And quit peeking, you pervert."  
天旋地转还不算最糟的。我的右脚踝感觉就像被肉锤狠狠敲打过一样。真嗣像摇布娃娃一样摇我，情况也没好到哪去。我用手遮住阳光，厉声道：“别摇了！我没死！”我皱着眉头拉下被我摔倒时掀起的裙子，“还有，别偷看了，你这变态。”

"Sorry." “对不起。”

He wasn't sorry at all, the jerk.  
他根本就不是真心道歉，这个混蛋。

"You're just saying that!"  
"你只是说说而已！"

Ignoring the pain, I sat up with help from Shinji and saw what it was that had the power to knock me senseless. I was expecting an American football player, but I saw a petite girl with blue hair. She was rubbing her head while sitting up, and her half-eaten toast quickly became a paradise to some passing robins. "Ouch... ouch... ouch..." she groaned.  
忍着痛，我在真嗣的帮助下坐了起来，看到了那个能把我撞得晕头转向的东西。我本以为会是个美式橄榄球运动员，结果却是一个蓝发娇小的女孩。她正揉着头坐起来，而她手中那半块未吃完的吐司很快就成了几只飞过的知更鸟的天堂。“哎哟...哎哟...哎哟...”她呻吟着。

You don't have to say it more than once... it's killing me too...  
不用重复说...我也很难受...

I groaned when Shinji tried to haul me to my feet, and I quickly found that I couldn't stand on that damn ankle. I sank back to the ground again. "Great... just great..." I muttered.  
当真嗣试图把我拉起来时，我呻吟了一声，很快发现我那该死的脚踝根本站不住。我又沉回地面。“太好了...真是太好了...”我嘟囔着。

The girl finally opened her eyes and she immediately apologized. Unlike me, she didn't seem to have a broken ankle or a pounding head, because as soon as she said she was sorry, she picked up her briefcase and started running. She called over her shoulder, "Sorry! I'm late for school!"  
女孩终于睁开眼睛，立刻道歉。与我不同，她似乎没有断掉的脚踝或剧烈的头痛，因为一说出对不起，她就拿起公文包开始奔跑。她回头喊道：“对不起！我上学要迟到了！”

_Wait! Hey! 等等！嘿！_

I yelled at her to come back, but she didn't hear me. Why does this sort of thing always happen to me? Shinji didn't know quite what to make of it either. She certainly was rude!  
我大声叫她回来，但她没听见。为什么这种事总是发生在我身上？真嗣对此也一头雾水。她确实很无礼！

"Do you need help?" 你需要帮忙吗？

I gritted my teeth and used Shinji's arm as a pole to help me climb up. As soon as my injured ankle got pressure put on it, I fell to the ground again. "I can't stand on it!" I exclaimed pointlessly.  
我咬紧牙关，借助真嗣的手臂作为支撑爬上去。一施加压力到受伤的脚踝上，我又一次摔倒在地。“我站不起来！”我无谓地喊道。

"—I... I don't know..." "—我... 我不知道..."

"Well, do something..." "那，做点什么吧..."

Shinji thought about it. "I could run to the school and get some ice..."  
真嗣想了想。"我可以跑到学校去拿些冰块..."

I clung to his arm and ordered him not to leave me here in the middle of the road. Truth was, I didn't know what to do either. I couldn't crawl to school... maybe I can hop there on one leg, you know, like those performers in Kabuki theater... yeah, and maybe...  
我紧紧抓住他的手臂，命令他不要把我丢在这半路上。说实话，我也不知道该怎么办。我总不能爬着去学校吧……或许我可以单脚跳过去，就像那些歌舞伎剧场的表演者一样……对，也许……

"I have to carry you there." Shinji sighed. When he saw the shocked look on my face, he added, "Unless you want to be dragged."  
“我得背你过去。”真嗣叹了口气。看到我震惊的表情，他又补充道，“除非你想被拖着走。”

No. I'd rather be carried. "But... but what about..." I knew I didn't have to finish that sentence. We thought so alike that sometimes it scared me, and I knew he was thinking the same thing I was.  
不，我还是宁愿被背着。“但是……但是关于……”我知道我不必说完那句话。我们想得太相似了，有时这让我害怕，我知道他也在想同样的事情。

_What if someone sees me? It's indecent...  
万一有人看见我怎么办？这太不雅观了..._

He put his fingers under his chin and tilted his head slightly forward, just like he always did when he was thinking. "Let them think what they want to think. We have to get to school," he said. Without another word, he lifted me to my feet. I tried not to put weight on that ankle for as long as I could, and when I did it sent painful needles up my leg.  
他将手指放在下巴下，微微向前倾斜头部，就像他思考时总是做的那样。'让他们想他们想想的吧。我们得去学校，'他说。没有再多说一句话，他扶我站了起来。我尽量不在那只脚踝上施加重量，能坚持多久就坚持多久，但当我不得不这么做时，疼痛如针扎般沿着腿往上窜。

After the arduous task of getting me up, I glared and asked acidly, "So what next, genius?"  
好不容易把我扶起来后，我瞪着他，尖酸地问道：'接下来怎么办，天才？'

"You'll have to jump on my back and I can carry you."  
"你得跳到我背上来，我可以背着你。"

I almost fell over again. "What? I thought you were going to carry me... you know... " I made a cradle motion with my arms.  
我差点又摔倒了。“什么？我以为你会抱着我...你知道的...”我用手臂做了一个摇篮的动作。

He quirked an eyebrow and looked at me curiously. "You know I'm not strong enough to do that, Asuka."  
他扬起一边眉毛，好奇地看着我。“你知道我力气不够，抱不动你的，飞鸟。”

"Yeah... I know... but..." He glared at me, and I didn't want to continue that train of thought. I guess being on his back was better than being carried like a newborn. It won't do a damn thing for decency though... I sighed. "When are you going to start lifting weights already?"  
"嗯...我知道...但是..." 他瞪了我一眼，我便不想继续这个话题了。我想，趴在他背上总比像个新生儿一样被抱着强。但这对于体面来说毫无帮助...我叹了口气。"你什么时候才能开始练举重啊？"

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

Of course, this was all mild mannered teasing. Once I taught Shinji how to stand up for himself, I don't think he's acted spineless since. I was proud of myself. "All right, brace yourself." I hopped up onto his back (with one leg, I might add), and clung to his neck with all my strength. I already knew the boy had no muscle and that wasn't his fault, but if he toppled over backward I was taking him down with me.  
当然，这只是温和的调侃。自从我教会了真嗣如何自立，我想他就没有再表现得软弱过。我为此感到自豪。"好吧，做好准备。" 我单腿一跃，跳上了他的背，紧紧抓住他的脖子。我知道这孩子没什么肌肉，这不是他的错，但如果他往后倒，我也会拉着他一起倒下。

He staggered and teetered on one foot, and I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst. Miraculously, he righted himself after throwing his arms in the air to regain his balance. Shinji hooked his arms under my legs and linked his hands together under me, forming a nice seat. "Now don't be getting any funny ideas, Shinji."  
他踉跄着单脚摇晃，我闭上眼睛，准备迎接最坏的情况。奇迹般地，他挥舞双臂恢复平衡后，稳住了身形。真嗣将手臂穿过我的腿下，双手在我身下交扣，形成了一个舒适的座位。“现在别动什么歪脑筋，真嗣。”

To my surprise, he said nothing. Shinji took a shaky step forward, and then another. He caught on quickly and soon walked rather fast, though I realized that we'd never make it to school before the bell at this rate. "What's the time?"  
令我惊讶的是，他什么也没说。真嗣颤巍巍地迈出一步，接着又是一步。他很快就适应了，不久便走得相当快，但我意识到，照这个速度，我们绝不可能在铃响前赶到学校。“现在几点了？”

I rested my head on his shoulder to look at my wristwatch. "There's no point in it now," I stated, "we're already eight minutes late."  
我把头靠在他的肩膀上，看了一眼我的手表。“现在看也没意义了，”我陈述道，“我们已经迟到了八分钟。”

At this announcement, Shinji let up on his pace. Eight minutes late, twenty minutes late, it was still late. No sense trying to rush for a deadline impossible to make.  
听到这个通知，真嗣放慢了脚步。八分钟迟到，二十分钟迟到，终究还是迟到了。既然已经赶不上截止时间，再匆忙也无济于事。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

Shinji turned his head very slightly to the right. "Weren't you carrying a purse?"  
真嗣微微向右转头，问道：“你刚才不是还拿着钱包吗？”

I would have hit myself if I wasn't holding onto Shinji's neck. "Shit! My lunch... I think... it must have been knocked away..."  
如果不是抓着真嗣的脖子，我真想给自己一巴掌。“该死！我的午餐...我想...一定是被撞飞了...”

"Your lunch?" Shinji stopped walking and turned his head even more to face me. I felt ready to fall off. "In your favorite bag?" It was the oldest lunchbag I had, dating back to our second grade days. I remember Shinji writing my name on it in permanent black marker one day during lunch. He said that this way, it'd never be lost or stolen. A second grader's lunchbag was a pretty important family friend back in those days, ranking up right there with your mother and father.  
“你的午餐？”真嗣停下脚步，更加转过头来面对我。我感觉自己快要掉下去了。“在你最喜欢的包里吗？”那是我最旧的午餐包，可以追溯到我们二年级的时候。我记得有一天午餐时，真嗣用黑色永久记号笔在上面写下了我的名字。他说这样，它就永远不会丢失或被偷。在那些日子里，一个二年级生的午餐包可是相当重要的家庭朋友，地位仅次于父母。

"Don't worry about it," I sighed. "I can always get another one." I felt bad enough straining him like this, and there's no point in being worked up over a tiny piece of nostalgia. "Just go."  
“别担心了，”我叹了口气。“我总能再弄一个。”我已经够让他受累了，为了一点小小的怀旧情绪大动肝火实在没必要。“走吧。”

Without ceremony, Shinji turned around on his heel and marched in the opposite direction of the school. He strained under my weight; I could feel the back of his neck getting warm with sweat. "We're already late anyways, might as well. That lunchbag... means a lot."  
没有丝毫犹豫，真嗣猛地转身，朝着学校的反方向大步走去。他用力支撑着我，我能感觉到他后颈因汗水而变得温热。‘反正已经迟到了，也无所谓了。那个午餐袋……对我很重要。’

I tried to tell him to stop sounding so damn wistful, but the roar of a red car hurtling down the street drowned that attempt. Shinji stumbled when the car raced past, and within I spotted the pale visage of our teacher.  
我试图告诉他别那么感伤，但一辆红色汽车沿着街道疾驰而过的轰鸣声淹没了我的尝试。汽车飞驰而过时，真嗣踉跄了一下，我瞥见了车内我们老师苍白的脸庞。

Misato Katsuragi. 葛城美里。

As soon as she tore past us, the sound of brakes squealing and rubber grinding against asphalt pierced the air. The entire car pitched forward as Misato managed to stop and reverse in one swift movement.  
她刚一从我们身边冲过，刺耳的刹车声和橡胶与沥青摩擦的声响便划破了空气。整辆车向前一倾，随后美里迅速地刹住并倒退了一步。

"Oh shit... she... she saw!"  
“糟糕...她...她看见了！”

"Who?" Shinji seemed even more confused than I did.  
“谁？” 真嗣看起来比我还要困惑。

I couldn't contain my exasperation; I lightly tapped him on the cheek with a finger. If anyone should know whose car that was, it would be Shinji. He along with two other dorks from my class made up the KIVS club, long name 'Katsuragi Is Very Sexy'. I asked them why they couldn't just call it KISS with 'Super' or 'Sensationally' to replace 'Very'. They stared at me like I am the dumbest person on the planet. They knew I had a good idea, but were too chicken to...  
我实在忍不住恼火，便用手指轻轻地在他脸颊上敲了一下。如果有人应该知道那是谁的车，那肯定是真嗣。他和我们班另外两个呆子组成了 KIVS 俱乐部，全称是'葛城真是太性感了'。我问他们为什么不直接叫 KISS，用'超级'或'惊人地'来替换'太'。他们看着我，好像我是这个星球上最蠢的人。他们知道我有个好主意，但又太胆小了……

The car pounced backwards and slammed to a halt right beside us. The reflection in her black car window mirrored two very embarrassed children.  
那辆车猛地向后一跃，然后在我们旁边嘎然而止。黑色车窗上的倒影映出了两个非常尴尬的孩子。

I was one of them.  
我就是其中之一。

The black plate of glass that was her window sank down slowly. Misato removed the sunglasses from her eyes with a flourish and peered at us. "Whatcha guys doing?"  
那块黑色的玻璃窗缓缓降下。惣流摘下墨镜，潇洒地朝我们望来。“你们在干嘛呢？”

I wanted to punch that grin off her face.  
我真想一拳打掉她脸上的那副得意笑容。

"What does it look like we're doing?" I asked as haughtily as I could and failing miserably given the situation. "Trying to get to school. Of course." My voice cracked on the last two words, and I wanted to bury my face in the ground and never come back out.  
"“我们看起来像在做什么？”我尽可能傲慢地反问，但在这种情况下显然失败得很惨。“当然是去学校。”最后两个字我的声音都破了，真想一头扎进地里再也不出来。”

"Asuka? School is that way."  
"明日香？学校在那边。"

Oh shit. I had forgotten about that. I stammered to explain. "Well see, we were going to school, and when I came around the corner, I—"  
哦糟糕，我把这茬给忘了。我结结巴巴地解释道：“呃，你看，我们本来是要去学校的，然后我拐过那个角落，就——”"

"She's hurt Misato." Shinji gestured to my ankle with a jerk of his head. "She... twisted it. Maybe broke it." After Misato bore her eyes into him, he shifted from one foot to the other. "I'm taking her home."  
"她受伤了，美里。" 真嗣用头示意了一下我的脚踝。"她...扭到了，可能还骨折了。" 在美里严厉的目光下，他左右脚换着重心，"我正要带她回家。"

I sat upright, alert. I only thought we were going for my lunchbag! "Wait a second Shinji..." I turned to Misato. If I told her the truth, maybe she would... "I... um... dropped my lunchbag over there somewhere. I told Shinji he didn't have to go for it, but we came this way anyway."  
我猛地坐直，警觉起来。我本以为我们只是去找我的午餐袋！“等一下，真嗣……”我转向美里。如果我告诉她真相，也许她会……“我……呃……我的午餐袋不知掉在那边哪里了。我告诉真嗣不用去找，但我们还是往这边来了。”

Misato grinned at us, opening and closing her mouth as if to say something. Nothing ever came out. The more we stood in silence, the more fidgety I got. This is the part where she would suspend us for being late to school again. Never mind the fact that my right foot now felt detached from my body. Although Misato seemed carefree to outsiders, she severely punished students who disobeyed the rules.  
美里对着我们咧嘴一笑，嘴巴一张一合，似乎想说些什么。但什么也没说出来。我们越是在沉默中站立，我就越是坐立不安。这就是她会因为我们再次迟到学校而让我们停学的时刻。别提我的右脚现在感觉像是脱离了身体。尽管在外人看来美里似乎无忧无虑，但她对违反规则的学生惩罚极为严厉。

After staring at us (and enjoying my nervousness), Misato casually asked, "Do you need a ride?"  
在盯着我们（并享受我的紧张）之后，美里随口问道：“需要搭车吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

Shinji took a step back. "M-Misato?"  
真嗣后退了一步。“美里？”

_That was something I didn't expect.  
这真是出乎意料。_

Our teacher only smiled wider. "You need a ride to school, don't you?"  
我们的老师只是笑得更开了。“你需要搭车去学校，不是吗？”

"Well, yeah, but..." "嗯，但是……"

Misato held up her hand. Her eyes darted playfully to the seat behind the driver and she reached over to procure—  
葛城举起手，她的眼神俏皮地扫向司机后方的座位，随即伸手取出了——

"—my bag! The hell?" "——我的包！搞什么鬼？"

Misato hummed a couple bars of a song I couldn't recognize before abruptly stopping. She lazily twirled my bag around, purple strap winding around her wrist like a cloth bracelet. "You've lost it before Asuka. I wouldn't have known it was yours but..." she turned the bag over in her hands disdainfully. "... I spotted the color a mile away."  
葛城哼了几句我听不出来的歌，然后突然停下。她懒洋洋地甩着我的包，紫色的带子缠绕在手腕上，像是一条布制手链。“你以前也丢过，如果是别人，我可能认不出来，但是……”她轻蔑地翻转着包。“……我老远就看到了这颜色。”

I glared at her. "Don't start that again on me, Misato." To make a long story short, on Misato's first day of teaching she snidely commented on how hideous the color of my bag was. I told her that at least it had better color coordination than her current outfit. I should have kept my mouth shut; she made me clean the blackboards that day.  
我瞪了她一眼。“别再拿这事烦我了，葛城。”长话短说，葛城第一天当老师时，她就尖酸地评论我的包颜色有多丑。我回敬她说，至少我的包颜色搭配比她那身衣服强。我真该闭嘴的；那天她让我擦了一整天的黑板。

Damn you.  该死的你。

I left soap streaks all over the boards just to spite her. I mean, what new teacher makes remarks like that? I thought that would teach her. In my glee of finally having revenge, I forgot my bag at the school. The next day, Misato was sitting at her desk, hands clasped together and my bag in her hands. She was surrounded by the soapy blackboards.  
我在黑板上留下了肥皂痕迹，就是为了气她。我是说，哪个新老师会那样说话？我以为这会给她个教训。在终于报复成功的喜悦中，我忘了拿走我的书包。第二天，三笠坐在她的桌子前，双手合十，手里拿着我的书包。她周围是沾满肥皂的黑板。

I was the only one there.  
那里只有我一个人。

She gave me my bag and said that she was only joking. "Lighten up, Asuka. It's sad when a grownup acts more like a child than the child does." I snatched the bag from her and grudgingly said thanks. Misato grinned.  
她把书包递给我，说她只是在开玩笑。“放轻松点，明日香。当一个成年人表现得比孩子还幼稚时，真是可悲。”我从她手里夺过书包，不情愿地说了声谢谢。三笠咧嘴笑了。

The relationship between her and me... well, not one that most of the students have with their teachers, but we shared a sort of sisterly bond.  
她和我之间的关系...嗯，与大多数学生和老师之间的关系不同，我们之间有一种姐妹般的情谊。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"What!" “什么！”

"Here." She threw the bag at Shinji's face, but considering both of his hands were occupied in holding me up, couldn't catch it. He flinched, but I miraculously caught it with my hand flipped around backwards. "There isn't enough room in my car for both of you. Either you keep on walking together... or Asuka can be dropped off here and _you_ can walk."  
“给。”她将包扔向真嗣的脸，但考虑到他的双手正忙着扶我，无法接住。他一缩，但我奇迹般地反手接住了。“我的车里容不下你们两个。要么你们继续一起走...要么明日香可以在这里下车，你自己走回去。”

Shinji's knees were starting to shake. Whatever we were going to do, I'd be quick about it. I don't think he could take me sitting on his back much longer. "Well... Misato... um... see I want..."  
真嗣的膝盖开始颤抖。无论我们要做什么，我都会速战速决。我觉得他再也无法承受我坐在他背上了。“嗯……美里……呃……我想说……”

I half expected Shinji to ask if he could leave me here on the sidewalk while he rode in Misato's car. Yeah, he had that big a crush on her. He didn't want to carry me to school but he wanted to ride with Misato.  
我半期待着真嗣会问我是否可以把我留在这人行道上，而他则坐美里的车去。是的，他对她迷恋到了这种程度。他不想背我去学校，但他想和美里一起坐车。

Fine, leave an injured girl here by herself. I'll just claw my way to school.  
好吧，把一个受伤的女孩独自留在这里。我就用爪子爬到学校去吧。

"What'd you say, Asuka?" "你说什么，明日香？"

I whipped my head around and felt my face get red. Did I say that aloud? Crap! "I said... uh... I'll go in the car and Shinji can walk by himself to school."  
我猛地转过头，感到脸颊发烫。我是不是说出口了？糟糕！“我说...呃...我坐车去，让真嗣自己走路去学校。”

"Fine. Either way works," Misato said.  
"行吧。哪种方式都行，" 美里说。

"Plus," I remarked to Shinji, "you don't need the extra weight." I started to shift and pry his fingers out from under me. Shinji didn't turn around to drop me off in the seat as I had expected. Instead, his fingers clamped even tighter together under my legs. I stopped moving long enough to ask what he was doing.  
"另外，" 我对真嗣说，"你不需要额外的负担。" 我开始挪动身体，试图把他的手指从我身下抽出来。真嗣并没有像我预料的那样转身把我放到座位上。相反，他的手指在我的腿下更加紧握。我停下动作，足够时间问他正在做什么。

I felt him swallow. Hard. "I'll... I'll take her to school myself."  
我感觉到他艰难地吞咽了一下。"我...我会亲自送她去学校。"

I gasped. "What?!" Was he crazy?  
我惊讶地吸了口气。"什么？！" 他疯了吗？

What if we couldn't make it?  
如果我们到不了怎么办？

We'll be passing right in front of the school building. What if the students saw us?  
我们正要从学校大楼前经过。如果学生们看见我们怎么办？

What if they made fun of me? Of him?  
如果他们取笑我怎么办？取笑他呢？

What if... 如果……

Misato looked stunned. Obviously, she had been expecting that I'd ride in her car. "Shinji... I..." After the three of us stared at each other for a minute, Misato closed her mouth and placed her hands on the steering wheel. She rolled up her window and the car roared to life. Before she dashed down the street, I caught the faintest hint of a smile on her face.  
美里显得很震惊。显然，她原本以为我会坐她的车。“真嗣……我……”我们三人互相对视了一分钟后，美里闭上了嘴，把手放在方向盘上。她摇上车窗，车子轰鸣着启动了。在她疾驰而去之前，我瞥见了她脸上最微弱的笑容。

"Good luck kids," she had said.  
她曾说过：“祝你们好运，孩子们。”

Shinji and I watched it as it swerved to avoid a rolling trashcan before finally disappearing around a corner. Once it was out of sight, I exhaled, not remembering that I forgot to breathe. "Shinji... what the hell are you thinking?"  
真嗣和我看着它为了躲避滚动的垃圾桶而急转弯，最终消失在街角。一旦它不见了踪影，我才呼出一口气，意识到自己刚才竟然忘了呼吸。“真嗣……你到底在想什么？”

He pushed me up further on his back and started his shaky walk. "I don't know... maybe I like carrying weight."  
他把我往背上推了推，开始摇摇晃晃地走起来。“我不知道……也许我喜欢负重的感觉。”

I snorted. "It'll put some muscle on that scrawny frame of yours, that's for sure." Despite my repeated attempts to get him to go with me to a gym, he always shied away from that. Of course, he claimed that he was already in shape. Maybe this would help him after all. "Well, if I was a sack of rice, you wouldn't hesitate to drop me off."  
我嗤笑一声。“这肯定能让你的瘦弱身板长点肌肉。”尽管我多次试图拉他一起去健身房，他总是避之不及。当然，他声称自己已经很健壮了。或许这样对他终究有好处。“好吧，如果我是一袋米，你肯定毫不犹豫地把我扔下。”

"If you were a sack of rice, you wouldn't be talking either."  
"如果你是一袋米，你也不会说话的。"

I loosened my grip around his neck. "Touché, Shinji. I see you still don't like walking with people."  
我松开了掐在他脖子上的手。“说得好，真嗣。看来你还是不喜欢和人一起走路。”

He shrugged, but didn't answer.  
他耸了耸肩，但没有回答。

I knew exactly why. He wouldn't walk to school with anyone else but me. Not even with Touji or Kensuke. He'd rather walk alone. I never understood why, but that's the way he is. Maybe I should be flattered that he'd choose me. However, he acted pretty uncomfortable with this, and I was the only one he would walk with. Why?  
我清楚原因。他只会和我一起走去学校，不会和其他任何人，哪怕是东治或健介。他宁愿独自一人走。我从未明白为什么，但这就是他的性格。或许我应该感到荣幸，他选择了我。然而，他对此显得相当不自在，只有我会和他一起走。为什么呢？

"Are you embarrassed that people will see us like this?" he asked.  
“你是因为怕别人看到我们这样而感到尴尬吗？”他问道。

Not really.  倒也不是。

"No, why?" “不，为什么？”

Shinji slowed down, as if trying to delay the inevitable. "I don't know... I was just wondering."  
真嗣放慢了脚步，仿佛试图推迟那不可避免的时刻。“我不知道……我只是有点好奇。”

"How long have we been best friends?" I asked suddenly.  
“我们成为最好的朋友有多久了？”我突然问道。

Shinji paused before answering. "Since second grade."  
真嗣停顿了一下才回答。"从二年级开始。"

"Do you remember when our families went swimming together in second grade?"  
"你还记得我们两家二年级时一起去游泳的事吗？"

He laughed a little bit. "Yeah." His stride grew a little longer and a little less shaky. "The water was freezing, but we didn't care."  
他轻笑了一声。"记得。"他的步伐变得稍长，也少了几分踉跄。"水很冷，但我们不在乎。"

"And when we went swimming again?"  
"当我们再次去游泳时呢？"

He looked up into the sky as if to gather his thoughts. "Um... in the summer... I think..."  
他抬头望向天空，似乎在整理思绪。“嗯……在夏天……我想……”

I could hear the thin whistle of a lark overheard. The air suddenly grew stagnantly hot. "Do you remember what we were wearing?"  
我能听到头顶上一只百灵鸟细弱的鸣叫声。空气突然变得闷热停滞。“你还记得我们当时穿了什么吗？”

He paused for too long. In fact, he didn't answer.  
他停顿得太久了。事实上，他没有回答。

"Then if you know the answer, you'd have to agree that we're pretty comfortable with each other, right?" I pressed.  
“那么，如果你知道答案，你就得承认我们彼此相当熟悉，对吧？”我追问道。

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

I leaned in closer to his ear so he would hear me. "Then tell me the truth. Why are you not comfortable with me now?"  
我凑近他的耳朵，好让他能听见我。“那就告诉我真相。为什么你现在对我感到不自在？”

Have you really changed that much?  
你真的变了很多吗？

The lunchbag wrapped around my wrist slapped against his arm, and the only noise was that of the tiny zipper tapping against its track. "Well?"  
绑在我手腕上的午餐袋拍打着他的手臂，唯一的声音是微小的拉链敲击其轨道的声响。“怎么了？”

"People change, Asuka." "人都是会变的，明日香。"

"Oh." My heart broke in two; I didn't feel like I knew this Shinji anymore. He carried me for a sense of duty, not because he wanted my company. Because of him I was hit by the girl, and if I hadn't hit her then he would have. Typical Shinji, he put the blame on himself. "Yeah. People change."  
"哦。" 我的心碎成了两半；我感觉自己已经不认识这个真嗣了。他背我是因为责任感，而非想要我的陪伴。因为他的缘故，我被那女孩打了，如果我没反击，他也会这么做。典型的真嗣，他把责任都揽在自己身上。"是啊，人都是会变的。"

"Do you think I've changed, Asuka? Is that what this is about?"  
"你觉得我变了吗，明日香？这就是我们之间的问题吗？"

I bit my lip. "Sorry I asked."  
我咬了咬嘴唇。“抱歉，我问了不该问的。”

"Have I... changed?" “我……变了吗？”

I didn't answer. 我没有回答。

"Why do you think I've changed?"  
"你为什么觉得我变了？"

I answered him with a question of my own. "Why are you carrying me on your back?" He was probably doing it just because he felt bad. Or maybe to thank me so that he wasn't hit. Or maybe to show to Misato that he was a strong boy and deserving of her love...  
我用一个问题回答了他。“你为什么背着我？”他这么做可能只是因为他觉得内疚。或者也许是为了感谢我，这样他就不会被打。或者也许是为了向美里展示他是一个强壮的男孩，值得她的爱……

I scowled. Like _that_ was going to happen.  
我皱了皱眉。好像那会发生似的。

"Because..." Shinji kicked a pebble and sent it skittering across the sidewalk, all without making me feel like I was going to fall off. "Because I like having you walk with me."  
"因为..." 真嗣踢了一块小石子，让它在人行道上蹦跳着滚远，全程都没让我感到要掉下去。"因为，我喜欢和你一起走路。"

I stopped examining a battered stop sign long enough for his words to sink in. That wasn't the answer I expected. Three times in one day. "And you carried me on your back just because you like walking with me?"  
我停止了观察一个破旧的停车标志，好让他的话在我心中沉淀。这并不是我预料中的答案。一天之内第三次了。"你就因为我喜欢和你一起走路，就背着我走？"

"I'd rather be with you than be alone."  
"我宁愿和你在一起，也不愿孤单一人。"

We walked a bit of the way in silence. So... Shinji had changed. But he changed for the better. At least now he wants to walk with me instead of being forced to because I was the one who woke him up every morning.  
我们沉默地走了一段路。看来...真嗣变了。但这是往好的方向变。至少现在他是自愿和我一起走，而不是像以前那样，每天早上都是我叫醒他，他才不得不和我一起走。

He cleared his throat. "And... I like you, Asuka. You're my friend."  
他清了清嗓子。“还有...我喜欢你，明日香。你是我的朋友。”

I ordered myself to let it slide. A simple "I like you" can mean so many things. Knowing Shinji, it was most likely meant in a friendly way.  
我命令自己不要多想。一句简单的“我喜欢你”可以有很多含义。以我对真嗣的了解，这很可能只是朋友间的喜欢。

"I like you Asuka."  "我喜欢你，明日香。"

But then again... I've never heard him say those to anyone before...  
不过话说回来...我以前从没听他对任何人说过这样的话...

When we got to the school, I prepared myself for the worst. There was no other entrance to the nurse's office than through the front, meaning we'd have to endure the stares of everyone in the building. I heard a shriek from the fourth story window (most likely Hikari), and suddenly my classroom windows were pulsing. Pulsing with the excited hits and taps of everyone inside.  
当我们到达学校时，我做好了最坏的打算。去医务室只有前门一条路，这意味着我们得忍受整栋楼里所有人的目光。我听到四楼窗户传来一声尖叫（很可能是光），突然间，我教室的窗户开始震动。里面的人兴奋地敲打着窗户，发出阵阵声响。

Touji threw open a pane of glass and shouted out the window, "Shinji! You the _man_!"  
冬二猛地推开一扇玻璃窗，对着窗外大喊：“真嗣！你真行！”

More assorted shouts followed.  
随后传来更多杂乱的喊声。

"Traitor!" “叛徒！”

"Blackmail material! Ex-ce-llent-e!"  
"敲诈材料！太棒了！"

"It's scandalous...!" "真是丑闻啊...！"

"Ah! That's the jerk who was staring at my panties!"  
"啊！就是那个偷看我内裤的混蛋！"

My head jerked up and I shook a fist at the windows while clinging onto Shinji with one arm. "Who the hell just said that?!" I most certainly was not a jerk! And what panties? What...  
我猛地抬头，一边用一只手紧抓着真嗣，一边向窗户挥拳。“刚才是谁说的？！”我绝对不是个混蛋！还有，什么内裤？什么……

Shinji shuffled his arms under me as we passed directly under the window. It was the only way to get to the entrance. "Ignore them. Just ignore them..."  
当我们直接从窗户下经过时，真嗣把他的手臂从我身下挪动。这是到达入口的唯一方式。“别理他们。就当没听见……”

Just ignore them?  就当没听见？

"You know there's another way in! The janitor's door leads right to the courtyard and we could have gone in there!" I snapped. Why did he have to go and do this? Janitor Ryouji would have been more than happy to sneak us into school. He was just cool like that. Rumor had it that our teacher had a soft spot for the man... "You know the janitor, right?"  
“你知道还有别的路进去！清洁工的门直接通向庭院，我们本可以从那里进去的！”我气愤地说。他为什么要这么做？清洁工良治会很乐意偷偷带我们进学校的。他就是那么酷。有传言说我们的老师对那个人有点偏爱...“你认识那个清洁工，对吧？”

Before reaching for the doorknob, Shinji paused. "Thank you for walking with me, Asuka." He looked down, and in doing so his chin rested on my arm.  
在伸手去抓门把手之前，真嗣停顿了一下。“谢谢你陪我走这段路，明日香。”他低下头，下巴顺势搭在了我的手臂上。

That action quelled whatever fury I had in me of being seeing in a less than ladylike position. I stammered out a thank you, unable to decipher if that was a gesture of tenderness or Shinji simply trying to see where the doorknob was.  
这个动作平息了我因处于不雅姿势而被看到的怒气。我结结巴巴地道了谢，无法分辨那是温柔的表示还是真嗣只是想看看门把手在哪里。

But the way he held it on there long after the door was open... the way he triumphantly turned to look at me when we reached the nurses' office... the way he gently set me down on the bleached sheets of the examining bed, making sure I had a pillow behind my head... the way he smiled before Nurse Akagi closed the door and ordered him to go back to class...  
但他在门早已打开后仍久久地扶着它...当我们到达医务室时，他得意地转头看向我...他轻柔地将我放在漂白的检查床上，确保我的头后有枕头...在赤木护士关上门并命令他回教室之前，他露出的微笑...

After Nurse Akagi removed my shoe (with a considerable amount of pain, may I add), she said, "Miss Langley, I'm going to wrap your ankle, it's not broken, but it's pretty swollen. Think of something else other than the pain." The command from the yellow-headed nurse was firm but gentle.  
在赤木护士脱下我的鞋（我得说，相当痛苦）后，她说：“兰格利小姐，我要包扎你的脚踝，它没断，但肿得很厉害。试着想点别的，别老想着痛。”这位黄发护士的命令坚定而温和。

_"I like you, Asuka." “我喜欢你，明日香。”_

Maybe it is just me.  
或许这只是我个人的感觉。

Maybe I read into these things too much for my own good.  
或许我对自己太过苛求，总是过度解读这些事情。

Maybe... I'm making a mountain out of a sandhill.  
或许...我是在小题大做。

I turned my head and stared out of the window. The colors outside were so brilliantly bright that the sharp pains in my ankle were easily ignored. I looked up into heavens through that dirt-streaked window and thought to myself...  
我转过头，凝视着窗外。外面的色彩如此绚烂夺目，以至于脚踝上的剧痛轻易被忽略了。我透过那扇沾满尘土的窗户仰望天空，心中暗想……

... the sky really is beautiful today.  
……今天的天空真的很美。

**The End 完**

Author's notes: It's official. I'm a romantic. Give me angst, give me comedy, but nothing can top romance. Sappy yes, but the idea wouldn't let go. Didn't like the ending too much, but then again... I wanted to end it sappily ^_^ I might expand on this, but I think it stands well on its own.  
作者的话：正式宣布，我是个浪漫主义者。给我悲伤，给我喜剧，但没有什么能超越浪漫。虽然有点肉麻，但这个想法就是挥之不去。不太喜欢结局，但话说回来... 我就是想让它甜蜜收场 ^_^ 我可能会扩展这个故事，但我认为它本身已经很完整了。

Oh, don't even bother to tell me Shinji was OOC, I already know. C'mon, the man sighed and said, "I caught just a little peek at her panties..." I don't know about you, but the Shinji we know would never say such a thing without his face bursting into flame. I stayed true to that alternate universe and made Shinji behave the way he was outlined to behave. I sort of shied away from that as the fic went along, because for the love of me I can't type Shinji speaking like a pervert. Can't. He went back to the original Shinji near the end of the fic, thank God.  
哦，别费心告诉我真嗣 OOC 了，我自己清楚。拜托，他叹了口气说，“我只是偷瞄到了她的内裤...”我不知道你怎么想，但我们认识的真嗣绝不会在脸红到冒烟之前说出这种话。我忠于那个平行宇宙，让真嗣按照设定的方式行事。随着故事的发展，我有点回避了这一点，因为我实在无法打出真嗣像个色狼一样说话。做不到。感谢上帝，他在故事接近尾声时回到了原来的真嗣。

Future plans? *thinks* I have a couple of epics in mind, so expect another Shinji/Asuka serial (yeesh, how'd you guess?) coming out sometime in August. Until later... keep on writing!  
未来的计划？*思考* 我脑中有几个史诗级的想法，所以期待八月某个时候会推出另一个真嗣/明日香的系列（哎呀，你怎么猜到的？）。在那之前... 继续写作吧！
