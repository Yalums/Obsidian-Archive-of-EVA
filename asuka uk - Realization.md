### Chapter 1
Music could be heard playing in the background as a young woman sat down on her bed. In her lap was a box with 'Photos' written across it, in thick black marker pen. Opening the box with a sigh, she saw the first picture. It was of her on her wedding day.
音乐在背景中轻轻播放，一位年轻女子坐在床边。她膝上放着一个盒子，上面用粗黑马克笔写着‘照片’。她叹了口气，打开盒子，第一张映入眼帘的照片是她婚礼当天的自己。

Standing next to her husband. Her auburn hair was worn up. with out her sync clips. The simple gown showed off her figure perfectly. Her husband on the other hand, wore a black tux. His blond hair combed back, and dark brown eyes stared back at her. Closing her eyes she remembered how she met him. It was a year after she left Japan. As there were no more angles to fight, she had wanted to return home.
站在她丈夫身旁，她的赤褐色头发高高盘起，没有佩戴同步夹。简约的礼服完美地展现了她的身姿。而她的丈夫则身着黑色燕尾服，金发向后梳得一丝不苟，深棕色的眼眸回望着她。她闭上眼睛，回忆起他们相遇的那一刻。那是她离开日本一年后，因为不再有天使需要战斗，她渴望回到家乡。

It was the summer of 2019. Her old friend dragged her to the local carnival, because she thought, it would cheer her up.
那是 2019 年的夏天。她的老朋友硬拉着她去了当地的嘉年华，因为她觉得这会让她振作起来。

FLASHBACK 闪回

"Come on Asuka, you know that you'll enjoy it."
"来吧，明日香，你知道你会喜欢的。"

"Jonna, I won't. There will be idiotic boys, and I can't stand them!"
"乔娜，我不会喜欢的。那里会有愚蠢的男生，我受不了他们！"

"Come on, just for me?"
"拜托，就当是为了我？"

"Oh alright, but I'm not promising to enjoy myself..."
"哦好吧，但我可不保证会玩得开心……"

END FLASHBACK 回忆结束

She remembered walking past the test your strength stall. She turned her head as she heard the bell ring. She searched to find where the sound had come from. She saw a pair of brown eyes looking back at her. Followed by a wolf whistle. Looking away in disgust and followed her friend to the candy stall.
她记得自己走过测力摊位时，听到铃声响起便转头寻找声音来源。她看到一双棕色的眼睛正回望着她，紧接着是一声口哨。她厌恶地移开视线，跟着朋友走向糖果摊。

Not even suspecting that she would end-up marrying that man, roughly two years later. After a long and treacherous courtship on his part. A small smile found it's way onto her face. As she remembered the countless times, that she teased him, or made him work just to get a date. She thought about it, 'That's why I must of fallen in love with him.' His sheer determination.
她从未料到自己会在两年后与那个男人结婚。在他漫长而曲折的追求过程中，一丝微笑悄然爬上她的脸颊。她回忆起无数次捉弄他，或是让他费尽心思才得到一次约会的机会。她想，'这就是我爱上他的原因。'他那纯粹的决心。

The next photo managed to bring her some happiness. It was her lying in a hospital bed, cradling her newborn daughter in her arms. A tear formed in her eye. She wanted to give her daughter the upbringing she never had. So far she had succeeded, even if it was only 50%. Like her mother she had married a man, who had a mistress, and never cared much for his daughter. She had only discovered this about eight months ago. 'Like mother like daughter,' she thought. Though she had succeeded where her mother had not. By giving her daughter the motherly attention, which she herself had not received.
下一张照片给她带来了些许快乐。是她躺在医院病床上，怀抱着刚出生的女儿。一滴泪珠在她眼角形成。她希望给女儿一个自己从未拥有过的成长环境。到目前为止，她已经成功了一半，尽管只有 50%。像她母亲一样，她嫁给了一个有情妇、对女儿不太关心的男人。她仅在八个月前发现了这一点。'有其母必有其女，'她心想。尽管她在母亲未能做到的地方取得了成功，给予女儿她自己未曾得到的母爱。

She looked at the next photo, and her eyes grew wide with surprise, for she had not seen these faces in years. Looking back at her was Misato, Penpen, Hikari, Kensuke, Touji, herself, and him, Shinji Ikari. She thought she had left those faces back in Japan. She quickly turned the photo over. But the next one she saw just made her fill up with tears. It was of her and Shinji dressed up to go to the school dance. She remembered it was Misato who wanted a picture of them.
她看着下一张照片，眼中满是惊讶，因为她已经多年未见这些面孔。回望她的是美里、企鹅 Penpen、光、真希、剑介、她自己，还有他，碇真嗣。她以为自己早已将这些面孔留在了日本。她迅速翻过照片。但下一张却让她泪流满面。那是她和真嗣穿着礼服准备去参加学校舞会的照片。她记得是美里想要给他们拍张照。

She dug out the one of her wedding day, and compared them, she couldn't help but noticed that her eyes seemed to shine more when she was with Shinji standing beside her, and her smile seemed genuine too. She couldn't help but wonder what was Shinji doing now, with his life. She knew he was married. She had received the invitation three years ago. But she didn't go. 'Stupid pride,' she thought, 'You always are going to get in the way. I know he's happy now.' She knew he would find happiness one day. 'At least one of us is,' she thought.
她翻出了自己婚礼那天的照片，对比之下，她不禁注意到，当她和真嗣站在一起时，她的眼睛似乎更加闪亮，笑容也显得更加真诚。她不禁想知道真嗣现在的生活如何。她知道他已经结婚了。三年前她收到了邀请函，但她没有去。'愚蠢的自尊心，'她想，'你总是会碍事。我知道他现在很幸福。'她知道他终有一天会找到幸福。'至少我们中有一个人是幸福的，'她想。

She knew deep down in her heart, as she sat staring into those blue eyes, that she never should have left Japan. Then maybe, she could have found happiness too, with Shinji. She knew that he cared for her now. That she too, cared for him. Even though she always told him the opposite. That she hated him. Though looking back now she knew she was wrong, she loved him. Now she will never have a chance to do that.
她内心深处明白，当她坐在那里凝视着那双蓝眼睛时，她本不该离开日本的。那样的话，或许她也能找到幸福，和真嗣在一起。她知道他现在关心她，她也关心他。尽管她总是告诉他相反的话，说她恨他。但如今回望过去，她知道自己错了，她爱他。现在，她再也没有机会去那样做了。

Bursting into the room was her daughter Kyoto.
突然闯进房间的是她的女儿京都。

"Mummy, mummy there's a monster under my bed, and it wants to eat me!"
“妈妈，妈妈，我的床底下有只怪物，它想吃掉我！”

"Is there, well the mighty Asuka will get it!" She replied, placing the photo back in the box, While thinking. 'Shinji I'll always remember, and if only I could turn back the clock.'
"“当然，强大的明日香会搞定的！”她回答道，将照片放回盒子里，心中想着，‘真嗣，我会永远记得你，如果时光能倒流该多好。’”

Meanwhile a young man was standing on the balcony of his apartment. Thinking thoughts that were the same.
与此同时，一个年轻人站在他的公寓阳台上，思绪万千，与她如出一辙。

**************************************************************************************

Authors note; I wanted to explore the idea of what if Asuka and Shinji never got together. That the opportunity had simply pasted them by. Then one day in the future, one of them (Asuka) reluctantly found this out. And what she thought.
作者注：我想探讨的是，如果明日香和真嗣从未走到一起，机会就这样从他们身边溜走。然后在未来的某一天，其中一人（明日香）不情愿地发现了这一点，以及她的内心所想。

### Chapter 2

A young man stood out on his balcony, gazing into the star lit sky. Wondering if things could have been different.
一个年轻人站在阳台上，凝视着星光璀璨的夜空。心中不禁思索，是否一切本可以有所不同。

He felt a hand on his shoulder, followed by a familiar voice.
他感到一只手搭在肩上，紧接着是一个熟悉的声音。

"Shinji, it's late, why don't you come to bed? You've got work tomorrow."
“真嗣，已经很晚了，为什么不睡觉呢？你明天还要工作。”

"I'm comming Mitsuri, I was just admiring the stars. I'll be along in a minute." With that she kissed her husband on the cheek, and retired for the night. He took one last look at the sky. Before retiring himself.
“我这就来，蜜璃，我只是在欣赏星星。马上就过去。”说完，她吻了吻丈夫的脸颊，便回房休息了。他最后望了一眼天空，随后也去睡了。

Slipping under the warm covers, he felt his muscles begin to relax. He felt his wife lay her head on his chest. He began to play with her mid-length brown hair. He stared at the familiar ceiling, as he heard the gentle purring of his wife, as she fell into the land of dreams. He began to reflect on the question that bugged him for three years. Why didn't she come to the wedding? He didn't know her reasons. Maybe he sent the invitation to the wrong address, but he got the address off Hikari. Perhaps she couldn't get the day off work, or there was no flight. Perhaps she simply didn't care about him, after all they had been through. Or maybe she couldn't bare him to be with another woman, he chuckled to himself.
滑入温暖的被窝，他感到肌肉开始放松。他感觉到妻子将头靠在他的胸膛上。他开始摆弄她中长的棕色头发。他凝视着熟悉的屋顶，听着妻子轻柔的呼噜声，她已沉入梦乡。他开始反思那个困扰了他三年的问题。她为何没来参加婚礼？他不知晓她的理由。也许是他把邀请函寄错了地址，但他从光那里得到了地址。或许她请不了假，或者没有航班。也许经历了那么多，她根本不在乎他了。又或许，她无法忍受他与另一个女人在一起，他自嘲地笑了笑。

Realizing that sleep was evading him, he slipped out of bed, being careful not to disturb his wife, and went to make himself a cup of tea. Sitting at the kitchen table, he pulled out his wallet from his coat pocket, that was hanging on the back of the chair. Removing the only picture that he kept in there, and smiled as his eyes fell onto the picture. It was of him and Asuka dressed up, to go to the school dance. He remembered how Misato nagged at them, just so she could have a picture.
意识到睡眠正躲避着他，他悄悄地下了床，小心翼翼地不吵醒妻子，然后去给自己泡了杯茶。坐在厨房的桌子旁，他从挂在椅背上的外套口袋里掏出了钱包。取出里面唯一的一张照片，他的目光落在照片上，露出了微笑。那是他和明日香盛装打扮去参加学校舞会的照片。他记得当时美里为了拍这张照片，是如何唠叨他们的。

He began to wonder what it would have been like if she had stayed in Japan. He had no idea where she was now, or what she was doing. She had broken off all contact with the past it seemed. Even Hikari hadn't recieved a letter for nearly eight months now.
他开始想象如果她留在日本会是什么样子。他不知道她现在在哪里，在做什么。她似乎切断了与过去的所有联系。就连光子也已经快八个月没有收到她的信了。

He began to remember their time at the school dance together, as this was his fondest memory of her. As he was graced to have her dance with him for quite a number of songs. The smell of her perfum began to fill his head. He found himself staring into her blue eyes. But as soon as he blinked they disapeared. Just like she did all those years ago.
他开始回忆起他们一起参加学校舞会的时光，那是他对她最美好的记忆。他很荣幸能与她共舞多曲。她香水的气味开始充盈他的脑海。他发现自己凝视着她蓝色的眼睛。但当他一眨眼，它们就消失了。就像多年前她消失的那样。

He knew that deep down Asuka had a lot of love to give, even back then. He wished that he was the one to recieve it. Though he knew he loved his wife, he never told her how much Asuka still meant to him. He kept that to himself. Sure he told things of her. Like their involvement with NERV, their fight against the Angels. After all he still worked for them, even if it was just to keep an eye on his father.
他深知，即便在那时，绫波内心深处有着许多爱意待人给予。他多么希望自己能成为那个接受她爱意的人。尽管他知道自己深爱着妻子，却从未向她坦露过绫波在他心中仍有多么重要。这份情感，他只藏在心底。当然，他会提及与她相关的事情，比如他们在 NERV 的参与，与使徒的战斗。毕竟，他仍在为 NERV 工作，哪怕只是为了监视他的父亲。

He found himself on the balcony again. this was his favourite place to just reflect. He knew that he missed his chance with her, but he was gratefull, because she had given him the desire to live, the fight for life. Even if it was for this reason only, he loved her. But he knew it was much more than that. Tears began to form in his eyes.
他又来到了阳台上，这里是他最喜欢静思的地方。他明白自己错过了与她在一起的机会，但他心存感激，因为她赋予了他活下去的渴望，对生命的执着。即便仅为此，他也深爱着她。但他知道，这份情感远不止于此。泪水开始在他的眼眶中打转。

"I'll remember you, Asuka, I'll never forget, I promise."
“我会记住你，绫波，我永远不会忘记，我发誓。”

她想带女儿去日本。毕竟她继承了日本的血统。此外，这也能让女儿了解历史，体会到她在天使战争中所经历的一切。她知道在 NERV 可以动用一些关系。毕竟她是一名少校，也是第二分部的运营经理。就这样，她想，我要挣脱束缚，我要回去。

Seeing this letter made her feel more hope than she had felt in a long time.  
看到这封信，她感到久违的希望涌上心头。  
"Mummy who's the letter from?" She took the girl onto her lap.  
"妈妈，这封信是谁寄来的？" 她把女儿抱到腿上。  
"It's from Auntie Hikari, and Uncle Toji. We're going to stay with them. when we visit Japan, You'll like that wouldn't you?" Her daughter face came to life with excitment.  
"是光子阿姨和东治叔叔寄来的。我们去日本的时候会住在他们那里，你会喜欢的，对吧？" 她的女儿脸上露出了兴奋的表情。  
"Really! Is Daddy comming to?"  
"真的吗！爸爸也会去吗？"  
"No I'm afraid Daddy has to work, but we can have fun together, and you can play with your cousin Tatsuri" Just then her husband returned home. Her excited daughter jumped out of her lap.  
"不行，爸爸得工作，但我们还是可以一起玩，你可以和你表姐龙葵一起玩。" 就在这时，她的丈夫回到了家。她兴奋的女儿从她腿上跳了下来。  
"Daddy, daddy do you have to work. Why can't you come to Japan with us?"  
"爸爸，爸爸，你得工作吗？为什么不能和我们一起去日本？"  
"What are you talking about Kyoto" she felt his eye bore into her.  
"你们在说什么京都" 她感觉到他的目光穿透了她。  
"Kyoto, why don't you go to your room, and start sorting out what you want to take" With that the four year old ran off to her room. Now she was going to face another battle, this one was with her husband however.  
"京都，你为什么不回房间，开始整理你想带的东西呢？" 说完，这个四岁的小女孩就跑回了自己的房间。现在，她即将面对另一场战斗，这一次是与她的丈夫。  
"What's this about Japan?"  
"这是关于日本的什么事？"  
"I've just arranged a visit to Japan as an educational trip. I am 1/4 japanesse. It's in her blood too."  
"我刚刚安排了一次去日本的教育旅行。我有四分之一的日本血统。她的血液里也有这份传承。"  
"You aren't going to Japan. I won't allow you to go. Your place is here."  
你不会去日本的。我不会允许你去。你的位置在这里。  
"I didn't fight the Angels to have YOU command me around, I', going and that's that." With that she turned away. Suddenly she felt a hand grab her wrist, he spun her round, and struck her across the face. Making her fall to the ground, due to the force of the blow. She touched her face, where the blow had connected wwith her skin. Looking at her hand she saw blood. A side of her was realsed at that second, it had long been dorment.  
"我与天使战斗，不是为了让你们来命令我的，我要走了，就这样定了。" 说完她转身离开。突然，她感到一只手抓住了她的手腕，他猛地将她转过身来，一巴掌扇在她的脸上。这一击的力量使她跌倒在地。她触摸着被击中的脸颊，看着自己的手，上面沾满了血。那一刻，她内心深处的一部分被唤醒了，那部分已经沉睡了很久。  
"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE. Nobody hits me. If you ever lay a finger on me again. You will no longer have the equipment to be classed as a man. As I will personally remove you manhood. NOW me and Kyoto are going. and not YOU or a BLOODY ANGEL is going to stop me." with tha she left to pack.  
"你他妈以为你是谁？没人能打我。如果你再敢碰我一下，你就别想再被称作男人了，我会亲自让你失去男人的资格。现在，我和京都要走了，你或者那些该死的天使都别想阻止我。" 说完她就离开去收拾行李了。

**************************************************************************************

### Chapter 4

BRING BRING 叮铃铃  
"I'll get it, it's probably Toji," Shinji picked up the receiver "Hello Ikari residence."  
"我去接，可能是冬二。" 真嗣拿起听筒，"你好，这里是碇家。"

"Hi Shinji it's Toji." "嗨，真嗣，我是冬二。"

"Hi Toji what's up?" "嗨，冬二，有什么事吗？"

"Just ringing to see if we're on for our usual lads get together tomorrow night."  
"只是打个电话确认一下，明晚我们那帮哥们儿的常规聚会还照常进行吗？"

"Yeah it's no problem. Just whose turn is it to drive?"  
"没问题。只是这次轮到谁开车了？"

"Err, Kensuke I think ... Yes it's Kensuke's turn as you drove last time."  
"呃，我想是健介吧...对，是健介的轮次，上次是你开的车。"

"Ok I'll see you there..."  
“好的，那儿见……”

"Wait a minute Shinji." "等一下，真嗣。"

"What is it?" “什么事？”

"I kinda promised Hikari not to tell you but..."  
"我答应过光不告诉你，但是……"

"But... what? Please tell me."  
"但是……什么？请告诉我。"

"Well... Asuka's visiting Japan next week, and she's staying with us. I just thought that you should know..."  
"嗯... 明日香下周要来日本，她会住在我们这里。我只是觉得你应该知道..."

That name hit him like a ton of bricks; he never thought he would see her again.  
这个名字像一记重锤击中了他；他从未想过会再次见到她。

"Shinji...Shinji are you there?"  
"真嗣...真嗣你在吗？"

"Oh... yeah I'm here." "哦... 是的，我在这里。"

"Are you alright?" "你还好吗？"

"Yeah... fine" "嗯... 还好"

"So it's settled then for tomorrow?"  
"那么明天就这么定了？"

"Yeah. Bye." "嗯，再见。"

With that he placed the receiver back on the hook.  
说完，他将听筒放回了挂钩上。

Shinji made his way to his study, He found himself trembling as he sat down at his desk. 'Get a hold of yourself it's not like its 2015.'  
真嗣走向书房，坐到书桌前时，发现自己竟在颤抖。“振作点，又不是 2015 年。”

So she was coming back to Japan, even if it's just for a visit. Hikari didn't want him to know about it, as she had made Toji promise. That must mean Asuka did not want to see him. 'Come on Ikari you're a grown man. How can one woman bring you down back to a trembling wreck?'  
所以她要回日本了，即便只是短暂停留。光并不想让他知道这件事，因为她已经让冬二答应保密。这一定意味着明日香不想见他。'振作点，碇，你是个成年人了。一个女人怎么可能让你再次变成颤抖的废人？'

A sigh escaped his lips. But she's not just any woman. She's Asuka Langley. The girl who insults him until hell freezes over. She was the most beautiful girl in school. Fiery, strong, and could match the boys on every level. But deep down she was really like him. A child lost in hate and betrayal.  
他叹了口气。但她不是普通的女人。她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。那个会一直骂他直到地狱结冰的女孩。她是学校里最美丽的女孩。热情、坚强，能在各个层面上与男孩们匹敌。但内心深处，她和他是相似的。一个在仇恨和背叛中迷失的孩子。

Shinji wanted to see her again. Even if it was just to apologise for not being there when she needed a friend, in her darkest hour. When the 15th Angel raped her mind. 'She needed me then and I wasn't there.'  
真嗣想再见她一面。哪怕只是为了为在她最需要朋友的时候不在她身边而道歉，在她最黑暗的时刻。当第 15 使徒侵犯她的心灵时。'那时她需要我，而我不在。'

Now to arrange it. Shinji had to get at least Toji on his side as he knew Hikari would protect Asuka from something she knew that Asuka didn't want. Sure Toji would understand. After all he recalled Toji teasing Asuka and him about being 'newly weds' when they were arguing again.  
现在得安排一下。真嗣知道，至少得让阿斯兰站在他这边，因为他清楚光会保护明日香，不让她接触到她不想知道的事情。当然，阿斯兰会理解的。毕竟他记得阿斯兰曾调侃他和明日香像是在吵架的‘新婚夫妇’。

He took out the picture, from his wallet. A flood of emotions swept over his body, at the thought of staring into those sapphire eyes again. Shinji knew he couldn't tell Mitsuri. It would break her heart. But he had to see Asuka again so the past could be put to rest. How he hated lying to Mitsuri. But Shinji wanted at least that one question answering. Why didn't she come to the wedding?  
他从钱包里拿出那张照片。一想到再次凝视那双蓝宝石般的眼睛，他的身体就被一股情感洪流淹没。真嗣知道他不能告诉美津里，那会让她心碎。但他必须再见明日香一面，让过去得以安息。他多么讨厌对美津里撒谎。但真嗣至少想得到一个答案。为什么她没有来参加婚礼？

He picked up his cell phone and dialled the number.  
他拿起手机，拨打了那个号码。

"Hello" "你好"

"Hello Toji, it's Shinji, I've got something to ask..."  
"你好，冬二，我是真嗣，有件事想问你..."  
Author's notes: I Know this chapters short but I'm building up for the next couple of chapter's.  
作者的话：我知道这一章很短，但我正在为接下来的几章chapter做铺垫。

### Chapter 5

From retrieving her bags from the carousel, she gently took her daughters' hand.  
从行李传送带上取回她的包，她轻轻牵起女儿的手。

"Lets go and find Auntie Hikari." Walking out of the arrivals lounge, she scanned the busy scene before her. Looking for the familiar face. But Hikari was not in sight. Wondering if her friend was waiting for her outside, she followed the exit signs. There was no sign of her friend on the street either. As a sense of dread began to fill her being, at the thought of negotiating a city she left years ago with a small child by her side. Just as she began to give up hope, a voice began to shout out her name.  
“我们去找光阿姨吧。”走出到达大厅，她扫视着眼前繁忙的景象，寻找那熟悉的脸庞。但光并未出现在视线中。她疑惑朋友是否在外面等她，于是跟着出口标志走去。街上也没有她朋友的踪影。想到要带着小孩在一个多年前离开的城市中摸索，一种不安感开始在她心中蔓延。就在她开始放弃希望时，一个声音开始呼喊她的名字。  
"Asuka...Asuka!" She turned to see a man running towards her. Realizing it was Toji, she simply waved in return.  
"明日香...明日香！" 她转身看到一个男人朝她跑来。认出那是真嗣，她只是挥手回应。

"Sorry I'm late, but traffic was a nightmare. This city could really use some more parking places." Toji noticed the little girl hiding behind Asuka's legs. Being the kind hearted man he was, he bent down to make his eye level the same as Kyoto, "And who's this pretty girl?"  
"抱歉我迟到了，但交通真是噩梦。这座城市真的需要更多停车位。" 真嗣注意到躲在明日香腿后的小女孩。他心地善良，弯下腰让视线与京都平齐，"这位漂亮的小姑娘是谁呢？"

"This is Kyoto. Say hello to your Uncle Toji." The girl let out a small giggle.  
"这是京都。跟你真嗣叔叔打个招呼。" 女孩发出了一声轻笑。

"Can Uncle Toji have a hug?" Toji just had to ask. Kyoto looked at her mother to see if she had any objections. Asuka smiled at her daughter to reassure her that everything was all right. Kyoto ran to Toji, and gave him a big hug. Asuka just looked on smiling, seeing her daughter enjoying the loving affection that she never received as a child. Something in her heart told her that she had made the right choice to come back to Japan. Letting the girl go, Toji stood up and looked Asuka in the eye.  
"舅舅托吉可以抱抱吗？" 托吉忍不住问道。京都看着母亲，想看看她是否反对。明日香向女儿微笑，让她放心一切都好。京都跑向托吉，给了他一个大大的拥抱。明日香只是微笑着看着，看到女儿享受着她童年未曾得到的关爱。她心中有种感觉告诉她，回到日本是正确的选择。托吉松开女孩，站起身来，直视明日香的眼睛。

"Hikari apologies for not being here to great you. But she couldn't get the day off work," Toji picked up two suitcases that where by Asuka's feet.  
"光子为没能来迎接你道歉。但她今天请不了假，" 托吉拿起明日香脚边的两个行李箱。

"You didn't pack light did you?"  
"你没少打包啊，是不是？"

"Hey a woman needs her things. Let me take one of them." She took a suitcase off him. Realizing that she perhaps did pack too much. Toji scooped Kyoto onto his shoulders as they picked their way through the crowd, to where Toji had parked the car.  
"嘿，女人总得有自己的东西。让我拿一个吧。" 她从他手中接过一个行李箱。意识到自己或许确实带得太多了。Toji 将 Kyoto 扛在肩上，他们穿过人群，走向 Toji 停车的位置。

The city seemed so unfamiliar to her as she watched it pass by the car window. It was nothing like her memories of old Toyko-3. She was looking for something that was familiar, be it a sign, a building or a street name, but alas nothing appeared.  
城市对她来说似乎如此陌生，她透过车窗看着它一闪而过。这与她记忆中的旧东京-3 截然不同。她在寻找一些熟悉的东西，无论是标志、建筑还是街道名称，但遗憾的是，什么也没有出现。

"Things sure have changed from what I remember."  
"确实，跟我记忆中的变化很大。"

"Yeah huge developments took place not long after you left," the car slowed as Toji again tried to find his parking space. "We're on the sixth floor, the elevators are this way."  
"是啊，你离开后不久就发生了巨大的变化，" 车辆减速，Toji 再次试图找到他的停车位。"我们在六楼，电梯在这边。"

As Toji opened the apartment door, the smell of flowers filled her mind. She remembered how much Hikari loved flowers. She found it very reassuring at the thought of at least some things never changed. Stepping into the apartment, the layout was not much different to that she had shared with Misato and Shinji.  
当 Toji 打开公寓门时，花香弥漫在她的脑海中。她记得 Hikari 有多么喜欢花。想到至少有些事情从未改变，她感到非常安心。走进公寓，布局与她和 Misato、Shinji 共享的并没有太大不同。

"Tatsuri, daddy's back!" A girl about the age of five came running and greeted her returning father with a hug. The girl reminded Asuka of Hikari, but she was clearly Toji's daughter.  
"Tatsuri，爸爸回来了！" 一个大约五岁的女孩跑过来，用拥抱迎接她归来的父亲。这个女孩让 Asuka 想起了 Hikari，但她显然是 Toji 的女儿。

"See I told you I wouldn't be long. Did you behave yourself? Or is your babysitter going to tell me nightmare tales again?"  
"看吧，我就说不会太久的。你乖了吗？还是你的保姆又要给我讲些噩梦般的故事？"

"I was a good girl daddy!"  
"我是个乖女孩，爸爸！"

"I see. Say hello to your auntie Asuka. She's going to be staying with us for a few days."  
"我知道了。向你阿姨明日香问好。她会和我们住几天。"

"Hello Auntie Asuka." "你好，明日香阿姨。"

"Hello Tatsuri. This is my daughter Kyoto, why don't you two go and play while I talk to your daddy"  
"你好，龙栗。这是我的女儿京都，你们两个去玩吧，我和你爸爸聊聊天。"

"Kyoto have you ever played..." The girls disappeared into Tatsuri's bedroom.  
"京都，你玩过...“ 两个女孩消失在龙栗的卧室里。"

She made herself comfortable on the couch, as Toji paid the babysitter and showed her to the door.  
她在沙发上坐得舒舒服服，而东治则付了保姆的工资，并送她到门口。

"You have a nice home."  
"你家真不错。"

"Thanks. It wasn't easy getting it." The phone began to ring, "Excuse me," Asuka could not quite make out what Toji was saying, but it seemed to be important.  
"谢谢。弄到这房子可不容易。"电话开始响了，"失陪一下，"明日香听不清东治在说什么，但似乎挺重要的。

"That was Hikari. She's arranged lunch for the two of you in her lunch hour, at cafe Springs. Do you remember where it is?"  
"那是光。她安排了你们俩在她午休时间去春泉咖啡馆吃午饭。你还记得那地方在哪儿吗？"

"If they haven't moved it in eight years then yes."  
"如果八年来他们没搬过地方的话，那我记得。"

"Its still in the same place, She says she'll meet you there in half an hour. I would give you a lift, but the babysitters just left."  
"它还在老地方，她说半小时后在那儿见你。我本想送你一程，但保姆刚走。"

"It's ok I could do with a walk," with that Asuka put on her shoes and set off.  
“没关系，我正好想散散步。”说完，明日香穿上鞋子，出发了。

"Shinji it's me, she's on her way and yeah she bought it."  
"真嗣，是我，她已经在路上了，对，她买了。"

**************************************************************************************

Author's note, I know this story has lost some of its deep emotional thought but trust me it will become more deep in a few chapters time. Asuka has to have another realization before she can sort her thoughts out on it. Same with Shinji.  
作者的话：我知道这个故事已经失去了一些深刻的情感思考，但请相信我，再过几章它会变得更加深邃。明日香需要再有一次领悟，才能理清她的思绪。真嗣也是如此。  
So what has Shinji and Toji got planned for Asuka, Well I guess you'll just have to wait and read the next chapter to find out.  
那么，真嗣和渡志为明日香准备了什么计划呢？好吧，你得继续阅读下一章《1001》才能揭晓答案。

### Chapter 6

Asuka stood outside of the cafe, remembering, the times they'd spent there after school. Looking at her watch she knew that it would be about another five minutes before Hikari would meet her. Asuka sat down at one of the outside tables and ordered a cup of tea. She found herself staring into oblivion, as she took in the view. Asuka heard a noise to the left of her. It sounded like someone sitting down.  
明日香站在咖啡馆外，回忆着放学后他们在这里度过的时光。她看了看手表，知道再过大约五分钟，光就会来见她。明日香在一张户外桌旁坐下，点了一杯茶。她发现自己凝视着虚空，沉浸在眼前的景色中。明日香听到左边传来一阵声响，像是有人坐了下来。

"Hi Hikari it's been..." She turned her head. But it wasn't Hikari's hazel eyes that greeted her. But some steel blue yes instead.  
“嗨，光，好久不……”她转过头去。但迎接她的并非光那双淡褐色的眼睛，而是某种钢蓝色的眼眸。

"It's definitely been a while," Shinji just smiled at her, wishing he had a camera to take a picture of the expression on her face. "I'm afraid Hikari won't be coming. You were set-up by Toji and me. I felt we needed to talk." Asuka's mouth opened and closed several times before finding something to say.  
"确实有一阵子了，" 真嗣只是对她微笑，希望自己有台相机能拍下她脸上的表情。"恐怕光不会来了。你是被我和阿薰设局骗来的。我觉得我们需要谈谈。" 明日香的嘴巴张开又闭上好几次，才终于找到话说。

"Two of the stooges managed to pull the wool over my eyes for once. Is the third planning something else?"  
"两个傻瓜居然这次能骗到我。第三个是不是还打算搞什么别的花样？"

"Kensuke has no idea you're here."  
"健介完全不知道你在这里。"

"So what is it that you want to talk to me about?" Nerves suddenly took a hold of Shinji. He couldn't believe that Asuka still had this power over him.  
“那么，你想跟我谈些什么呢？”紧张感突然攫住了真嗣。他不敢相信明日香依然对他有这种影响力。

"Well... I really want to know why you didn't come to my wedding? I wanted all of the old gang there."  
“嗯……我真的想知道你为什么没来参加我的婚礼？我希望所有老朋友都在场。”

Asuka was taken back by this, she could see the pain in Shinji's eyes, the pain she caused. She realized then that her pride was again hurting someone she deeply cared for.  
明日香被这话触动了，她能从真嗣的眼中看到痛苦，那是她造成的痛苦。她意识到，自己的骄傲又一次伤害了她深切关心的人。

"I didn't know that you wanted everyone there so badly," Asuka searched for an excuse that wouldn't seem to add more salt into his wounds, "I was going to come, but I couldn't get the time off work. If I remember correctly it was a tactical board meeting. As I'm the Major of tactics I had to go."  
"我没想到你那么希望大家都到场，" 明日香寻找着一个不会在他伤口上撒盐的借口，"我本来打算来的，但工作时间调不开。如果我没记错的话，那是个战术会议。作为战术指挥官，我必须参加。"

"So you wanted to come?"  
"所以你本来是想来的？"

"Yeah I wanted to know who actually won Shinji Ikari's heart," Asuka knew that she was partially lying. She did want to know who won Shinji's heart away from her. But a part of her couldn't bare to go and find out. She didn't want him to see what she had become.  
"是啊，我想知道到底是谁赢得了碇真嗣的心，" 明日香知道自己部分在撒谎。她的确想知道是谁从她身边夺走了真嗣的心。但内心的一部分却无法承受去面对这个事实。她不想让他看到自己变成了什么样子。"

"Anyway you couldn't have waited for me to fly all the way back to Japan. Just to ask me that one question?"  
"无论如何，你不可能为了问我那个问题就等我飞回日本吧？"

"In a way yeah." Asuka smiled she couldn't believe that he waited three years to ask her that.  
"某种程度上是的。" 明日香微笑着，她无法相信他为了问那个问题等了三年。

"I'll tell you one thing Shinji. We've got the whole afternoon, so why don't we spend it catching up on old times." Shinji couldn't believe his luck. The old Asuka would have called him a baka. Then stormed off saying she never wanted to talk to him again. 'Maybe this could give me a chance to know the real Asuka' he thought.  
"我要告诉你一件事，真嗣。我们有整个下午，不如用来聊聊过去吧。" 真嗣简直不敢相信自己的好运。以前的明日香可能会骂他笨蛋，然后气冲冲地走开，说再也不想和他说话了。'也许这能给我一个机会了解真正的明日香' 他心想。

"Why don't we go for a walk through the park? It's a nice day after all."  
“我们为什么不去公园散个步呢？毕竟今天天气这么好。”

It reminded Asuka of old times, times of walking home with him teasing him. Now she realized it was also good to talk to him. She never knew how much they were alike. As they had a similar childhood.  
这使明日香想起了旧时光，那些和他一起步行回家并捉弄他的日子。现在她意识到与他交谈也是件美好的事。她从未意识到他们有多么相似。他们的童年经历颇为相似。

Shinji realized that Asuka had become more beautiful in every way. Not only has her features matured with age. But her mind was even more beautiful now he could actually talk to her, instead of her yelling at him.  
真嗣意识到明日香在各方面都变得更加美丽了。不仅仅是她的外貌随着年龄成熟了。现在她的心灵更加美丽，他终于可以和她真正地交谈，而不是她对他大喊大叫。

"So then Kyoto said she didn't do it, even though she had chocolate all round her mouth!"  
“所以京子说她没干，尽管她嘴边全是巧克力！”

"Sounds like she's her mothers daughter," Asuka sat down on a bench in the park, they had spent the last two hours walking around, Shinji joined her.  
“听起来她真是她妈妈的女儿，”明日香在公园的长椅上坐下，他们已经逛了两个小时，真嗣也坐到她旁边。

"I'll tell you one thing Shinji, I think Kyoto would love you. I'll have to bring her round one day before we fly back."  
“我要告诉你一件事，真嗣，我觉得京都一定会喜欢你。在我们飞回去之前，我得找个时间带她过来。”

"I'd like that, but let me arrange it with Mitsuri, she isn't great with surprise visitors."  
“我很期待，不过让我先和蜜璃安排一下，她不太擅长应对不速之客。”

"Tell me more of Mitsuri, like where did you meet her?" Shinji stared into Asuka's eyes; it was still amazing to see them sparkle as the sun dances on a babbling brook.  
"给我多讲讲 Mitsuri 的事吧，比如你们是在哪里遇见的？" 真嗣凝视着明日香的双眼；依然令人惊叹，仿佛阳光在潺潺小溪上跳跃，她的眼睛闪闪发光。

"We met at college, it was in the cantine. I accidentally spilt milk down her top," Asuka let out a giggle, "What's funny about it?"  
"我们在大学里相遇的，是在食堂。我不小心把牛奶洒在了她的上衣上，" 明日香发出了一阵笑声，"这有什么好笑的？"

"It's funny because I know how you would have reacted. You would say your sorry and go red in the face," Shinji found himself turning red "See I was right!" Both let out a short laughter together. Asuka reached out and touched Shinji's hand. How this made her feel like a schoolgirl again. All nerves and shy. Shinji felt a shiver run down his spine. He started to wish that if only this could have happened back when they were fourteen. They found themselves looking deep into each other's eyes.  
"真有趣，因为我知道你会怎么反应。你会说对不起，然后脸红。" 真嗣发现自己脸红了，"看吧，我说对了吧！" 两人一起发出了短暂的笑声。明日香伸出手，触碰了真嗣的手。这让她感觉自己仿佛又变成了那个青涩的少女，紧张又害羞。真嗣感到一阵颤栗沿着脊椎而下。他开始希望，如果这一切能在他们十四岁时发生该多好。他们发现自己深深地凝视着对方的眼睛。

"This was great Shinji. I've really enjoyed today and I just want to say..."  
"真棒，真嗣。我今天真的很开心，只想说……"

Right then a familiar voice to Shinji broke the moment.  
就在这时，一个对真嗣来说熟悉的声音打破了这一刻。

"Shinji... I've got some real exciting news to tell you!" Asuka pulled her hand away and looked in the direction in which the voice called from. Asuka saw a woman walk up to Shinji. She had mid-length brown hair, with green eyes, though she was a little shorter than Asuka. Shinji stood up and greeted her with a hug.  
"真嗣……我有超级激动人心的消息要告诉你！" 明日香松开手，朝声音传来的方向望去。她看到一个女人走向真嗣。她有着中长的棕色头发，绿色的眼睛，虽然比明日香稍矮一些。真嗣站起身，热情地拥抱了她。

"Mitsuri, what are you doing here?"  
"蜜璃，你在这里做什么？"

"I was on my way back home to tell you some wonderful news." Asuka stood up.  
"我正赶回家，要告诉你一个好消息。" 明日香站起身来。

"Looks like your needed Shinji, I'll be going."  
"看来你需要真嗣，我先走了。"

"Oh did I interrupt something?"  
"哦，我是不是打断了什么？"

"It's ok Mitsuri. Me and Asuka where just catching up on old times." Mitsuri turned to face Asuka.  
""没事的，Mitsuri。我和 Asuka 只是在叙旧。"" Mitsuri 转过身来面对 Asuka。

"So this is the famous Asuka, it's nice to meet you at last. Shinji has told me so much about you."  
"原来这就是大名鼎鼎的 Asuka，终于见到你了，真高兴。Shinji 跟我提起过你很多次。"

"It's finally nice to meet the girl who stole Shinji's heart," Asuka had to bite her tongue. She knew that she had to be nice, after all this woman meant so much to Shinji. "Please go ahead and tell Shinji, I'll be on my way."  
"终于见到偷走真嗣心的女孩了，" 明日香不得不咬紧牙关。她知道必须表现得友善，毕竟这个女人对真嗣意义重大。"请转告真嗣，我先走了。"

"It's ok Asuka, I want as many as possible to know this." Shinji turned to his wife.  
"没事的，明日香，我希望尽可能多的人知道这件事。" 真嗣转向他的妻子。

"Tell me Mitsuri, what is it?"  
告诉我，蜜璃，那是什么？

"I've just come back from the doctors," Shinji suddenly became concerned, why would she go to the doctors and not tell him. "Don't worry Shinji, it's nothing serious. How would you like to become a father?"  
"我刚从医生那儿回来，" 真嗣突然担心起来，她为什么去看医生却不告诉他。"别担心，真嗣，没什么大不了的。你想不想当爸爸？"

"Father? What do you mean?" Shinji asked  
"爸爸？你是什么意思？" 真嗣问道

"I'm pregnant Shinji." "我怀孕了，真嗣。"

"Pregnant?" Shinji and Asuka said in unison.  
“怀孕了？” 真嗣和明日香异口同声地说。

**************************************************************************************

Author's note; how's that for a spanner in the works. So what is Asuka going to do now? Or Shinji for that matter.  
作者留言：这招搅局如何？那么，明日香现在会怎么做呢？或者，真嗣也是。

Well I guess you'll just have to wait for the last two chapters, yes just two more chapters to go.  
好吧，我想你只能等待最后两章了，没错，就剩两章了。

All comments welcome. 欢迎所有评论。

### Chapter 7

Shinji sat in his study. It had been four days since he last saw Asuka. He knew that she was flying back to Germany today. "I'm pregnant" those words kept flashing through his mind. He was going to be a father, and nothing could change the fact. A feeling of worry and concern crept over him. He didn't want to become his father. A cold hearted man who abandoned his child, just so could achieve his own happiness.  
真嗣坐在他的书房里。自从上次见到明日香已经过去四天了。他知道她今天就要飞回德国。“我怀孕了”这几个字不断在他脑海中闪现。他即将成为父亲，这个事实无法改变。一种担忧和关切的感觉悄然袭来。他不想变成他父亲那样的人。一个冷酷无情、为了自己的幸福抛弃孩子的男人。

Taking a sip of his tea, Shinji looked at the framed picture of him and Mitsuri, that was sitting on his desk. This was his future. His days of beening a teenager was over. For in nine months time, he will be responable for a new life. An innocentin this harsh world. He found himself becoming more determind not to let the same things that happened to him. Happen to this new life.  
真嗣喝了一口茶，目光落在桌上的相框上，里面是他和光代的合影。这就是他的未来。他的青少年时代已经结束。因为九个月后，他将肩负起一个新生命的责任。在这个残酷的世界里，一个无辜的生命。他发现自己变得更加坚定，不让那些发生在他身上的事情，发生在新的生命上。

He reached into him wallet and removed the picture that was there. Shinji was begining to wonder why she didn't visit. "She said that she would visit before she left" He was really looking forward to seeing her again. But now realizing that whatever they could of shared together, was going to be no more. He had other prooities now. For Mitsuri was carriny his child. Any thoughts of leaving her for Asuka, Where simply unthinkable. He was going to take responsability for his actions. He wasn't going to run away from them anymore, but face them like a man.  
他从钱包里掏出那张照片，心中开始疑惑她为何没有来访。“她说过会在离开前来看我的。”他真的很期待再次见到她。但现在他意识到，他们本可能共享的一切，都将不复存在。他现在有了其他的责任，因为 Mitsuri 怀了他的孩子。抛弃她去选择 Asuka，简直是不可想象的。他要为自己的行为负责，不再逃避，而是像个男人一样面对。

He allowed himself to become lost in those shappire eyes one last time. As he opened the bottom draw of his desk, a single tear rolled down his cheek. he pulled out an old personal file, and placed the picture inside. He paused for a brief moment before placing it back into the draw. He had to let go. No more could he dwell on the past and what could have been. He had to look to the future and facts. He was going to be a father.  
他最后一次让自己迷失在那双蓝宝石般的眼睛里。当他打开书桌最下面的抽屉时，一滴泪珠滑过他的脸颊。他拿出一份旧的个人档案，将照片放入其中。在将其放回抽屉前，他短暂地停顿了一下。他必须放手。他不能再沉溺于过去和那些可能发生的事情。他必须展望未来和现实。他即将成为一个父亲。

Asuka had answered the question that he'd always wanted to know. Now he could let her go. He was going to let her be a memory, and nothing more.  
Asuka 回答了他一直想知道的问题。现在，他可以让她离开了。他打算让她成为一个记忆，仅此而已。  
"Shinji dinners ready" "真嗣，晚饭好了"  
"Comming" "来了"  
He took a deep breath, he was going to move into the future.  
他深吸了一口气，准备迈向未来。  
"Goodbye Asuka" “再见，明日香”  
With that he went to the door.  
说完，他走向了门口。

Asuka found herself starring out of the window at ten thousand feet. Kyoto had fallen asleep on her lap. Looking down at her daughter, she saw herself when she was that age. A carefree child, before the mess of Eva stepped into it.  
明日香发现自己正凝视着窗外一万英尺的高空。京都已经在她膝上睡着了。看着女儿，她仿佛看到了自己年幼时的模样。那是一个无忧无虑的孩子，在 EVA 的混乱介入之前。

Her daughter was going to have the life, she never had. One of happiness and joy. No one was going to stop Kyoto having that life. She was going to see to that. To do that she knew she would have to leave her husband. In a way she knew it was selfish. Kyoto loved her dad. But love wasn't returned, Kyoto would feel rejected. Just like she did when her father rejected he. Rejection. Asuka knew that Shinji would now also reject her. Silent tears began to fall down her cheeks. No longer would he be waiting for her not with a child on the way. Her days in the angel war had taught her that Shinji hated his father, and would be determined not to follow his fathers footsteps. No matter how much her heart now longed for Shinji's touch. It was now out of her reach forever.  
她的女儿将会拥有她从未拥有过的生活，一个充满幸福和欢乐的生活。没有人能够阻止京都拥有这样的生活。她决心要确保这一点。为此，她知道她必须离开她的丈夫。在某种程度上，她知道这是自私的。京都爱她的爸爸。但爱并未得到回报，京都会感到被拒绝。就像她当年被父亲拒绝时一样。拒绝。明日香知道，真嗣现在也会拒绝她。无声的泪水开始从她的脸颊滑落。不再会有人在她怀孕时等待她。她在天使战争中的日子教会了她，真嗣憎恨他的父亲，并决心不步父亲的后尘。无论她的心现在多么渴望真嗣的触摸，这一切都已永远超出她的触及范围。

She realized now it was too late, mentally she kicked herself. Scolded herself, for not doing somethingabout it when she was fourteen and had the chance. Then perhaps she would have found herself in a happy marriage. Kyoto would have a father that loved her, and she wouldn't be lonely. Asuka voewed there and then not to let Kyoto make the same mistake she did.  
她现在意识到已经太晚了，内心责备自己。责骂自己，为什么在十四岁有机会时没有采取行动。那样的话，也许她会找到一个幸福的婚姻。京都会有一个爱她的父亲，而她也不会感到孤独。明日香当时就发誓，不让京都重蹈她的覆辙。

She mentally laugh to herself. mankind though it achieved perfection with the evangelions, but how could it she thought. When it can't even achieve perfection with it's own life.  
她在心里暗自发笑。人类自以为在使徒身上达到了完美，但她想，这怎么可能呢？连自己的生命都无法达到完美。

Well she wasn't going to waste hers, not now. For she found a new drive, she wiped her tears. She would always remember the past and what it taught her. She wasn't going to forget Shinji either, as he showed her the way to find love. But now she was going to strieve for the best in life, not for her but for her daughter. A sigh came from the child on her lap, she begun to stoke Kyoto's hair.  
好吧，她不会浪费自己的生命，尤其是现在。因为她找到了新的动力，她擦干了眼泪。她会永远记住过去以及它所教给她的一切。她也不会忘记真嗣，因为他指引她找到了爱的道路。但现在，她要为生活中最好的一切而努力，不是为了自己，而是为了她的女儿。她膝上的孩子轻轻叹息，她开始抚摸京子的头发。  
"It's just me and you now. and no one is going to stop us"  
“现在只有我和你了，没有人能阻止我们。”

The End 终章  
Author's notes Sorry it taken sooooo long to finish but i've been studying hard over the last year, and it kind off took up my time. Plus this chapter was draining to write when i actually sat down and wrote it. because how was Shinji and Asuka going to let go off each other.  
作者的话 抱歉花了这么久才完成，但过去一年我一直在努力学习，这几乎占用了我所有的时间。再加上写这篇《一千零一夜》时，当我真正坐下来写的时候，感觉非常耗神，因为要如何让真嗣和明日香放手彼此。

### Comment
matta: shitty ending excellent idea i would have ended it like this: shinji's wife has te kid but on the labor there are difficulties and both die hahahahahaha good ha, i liked it is a nice short, verry nice and short story  
糟糕的结局 绝佳的点子 我会这样结束它：真嗣的妻子生孩子时遇到困难，两人都死了 哈哈哈哈哈 不错，我喜欢这个短篇，非常不错且简短的故事

[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): 
I think as this is a nice and sad story as well, I think there should bean epilogue or sequel.  
我认为既然这是一个既美好又悲伤的故事，应该有一个尾声或续集。  
  
Now you'll say hey they have kids to be good parents for right!  
现在你会说，嘿，他们有孩子，为了成为好父母，对吧！  
  
Well who's to say they couldn't get together ...say after one of the spouces die?  
那么，谁又能说他们不能在一起呢...比如说，在一方配偶去世之后？  
  
Mutsumi may have a heart attack and a few years later they both find each other say by accident. They renew their relationship and spend the rest of their lives finally together.  
睦可能会有心脏病发作，几年后他们偶然相遇。他们重燃旧情，并最终共度余生。  
  
Sounds like a good outline for an epilogue or sequel stoey to me!  
听起来像是个不错的尾声或续集故事大纲！

[Marcos Edson](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/297971/Marcos-Edson): 
It's been a long wait, I'm glad you didn't abandon this fic. :)  
等待已久，很高兴你没有放弃这篇同人文。 :)  
  
The ending was something I had already pictured, I was sure you would not make something cruel like killing Shinji's wife or moving her away somehow, having Shinji and Asuka following their own paths seemed the best solution since it started. I'm glad, though, that you hinted Asuka might leave that husband of hers, his behavior was unforgivable...  
结局是我早已预见的，我确信你不会做出残忍的事，比如杀死真嗣的妻子或以某种方式让她离开，让真嗣和明日香各自走自己的路似乎是最好的解决方案，从一开始就是如此。不过，我很高兴你暗示明日香可能会离开她的丈夫，他的行为是不可原谅的...  
  
Maybe one day you can write a story, maybe a one shot, that shows how both families are doing some years after this meeting... :)  
也许有一天，你可以写一个故事，或许是一篇短篇小说，展示这次会面几年后两个家庭的情况... :)

[Andross937](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/354228/Andross937): Dude! This story is great! A few spelling mistakes, actually, they're more like mistypes. Anyways, the story line is great and well developed. Asuka needs to get a devorce, that's pretty clear to me. When the husband hits his wife, then it's time to say goodbye to him. But I do wonder what Shinji would do if he found out about it. And where's the mark on her face? If there was blood from the punch he gave her, then there should be a mark. If Shinji was looking at her face so much, then he should have seen a mark and been concerned. Well, I really want to know what happens next. Please e-mail me when you have finished the next chapter. Also if you would like another pre-reader, then I would like it if you would consider me. Thank you.  
老兄！这个故事太棒了！虽然有一些拼写错误，实际上，更像是打字错误。不过，故事情节很棒，发展得也很好。明日香需要离婚，这一点对我来说很清楚。当丈夫打妻子时，就是时候和他告别了。但我确实好奇，如果真嗣发现了这件事，他会怎么做。还有，她脸上的伤痕呢？如果那一拳让她流血了，那么应该会有痕迹。如果真嗣一直在看她的脸，那么他应该会注意到痕迹并感到担忧。嗯，我真的很想知道接下来会发生什么。请在完成下一篇chapter时给我发邮件。另外，如果你需要另一位预读者，我希望你能考虑我。谢谢你。

[frograss](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/317151/frograss): I like the pace of the story. The story seems to tell itself in parts. Good use of characters thoughts and desires. It was slightly anxious but not full of angst (although angst is good). Chapters are short, but they seem to be only as long as they need be. I would like to see more. Don't be discouraged by the number of reviews, sometimes even great stories only recieve a few reviews (I've read quite a few like that).  FYI, The second branch of NERV was destroyed in episode 17. The branch in Berlin is the third.  
我喜欢故事的节奏。它似乎分段讲述着自己。很好地运用了角色的思想和欲望。略带紧张感，但并不充满焦虑（尽管焦虑也有其妙处）。章节虽短，却恰到好处。希望能看到更多。不要因评论数量而气馁，有时候，即便是佳作也只收获寥寥几条评论（我读过不少这样的作品）。附注，NERV 的第二支部在第 17 集被摧毁。柏林的分部是第三个。
