Strange dreams, untold love, mental instability, Shinji and Asuka.
奇异的梦境，未言的爱意，心神不宁，真嗣与明日香。

This is my first attempt at writing anything (fanfiction-wise) in two years, so go easy on me. I suppose this could be an ongoing project if people like it, but I can get very busy at times so don't hold me to that.  
这是我两年来首次尝试写同人文，请多多包涵。如果大家喜欢，这或许会成为持续更新的项目，但我有时会很忙，所以别对此抱太大期望。  
  
I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion or any of the characters therein. You get the idea.  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》或其中的任何角色。你懂的。

"I love you... Shinji-baka," she whispered.  
“我爱你……真嗣笨蛋，”她低声说道。  
  
She was leaning over him, legs straddling his legs, her body less than inches away from his body. Her breath was coming in soft, slow patterns and warming his skin. This amazing feeling overtook him, the feeling of closeness and warmth, the feeling he had longed for. The feeling that he knew all too well, because it reminded him of his mother. The mother he hadn't known for the majority of his life. He felt empty and alone without her, but he told himself that he wasn't alone. He forced his mind to think that he needed nobody. That was the wall he had built, the barrier he had put up to keep himself from feeling agony, pain, anguish, and loneliness.  
她俯身在他上方，双腿跨坐在他的腿上，身体离他不到几英寸。她的呼吸轻柔而缓慢，温暖着他的肌肤。这种令人惊叹的感觉笼罩着他，那种渴望已久的亲密与温暖，那种他再熟悉不过的感觉，因为它让他想起了母亲。这位母亲，他生命中的大部分时间都未曾了解。没有她，他感到空虚和孤独，但他告诉自己，他并不孤单。他强迫自己认为不需要任何人。那是他筑起的墙，是他建立的屏障，以防止自己感受到痛苦、悲伤、苦闷和孤独。  
  
"Asuka... I..." “明日香... 我...”  
  
The words refused to come to him.  
那些话就是说不出口。  
  
'Could she really... Could she feel this way?'  
'她真的能...她真的会有这种感觉吗？'  
  
His mind ceased to think as she slid her hands under his shirt, gently sliding her fingers across his abdomen and up to his chest. She pressed her lips to his and closed her eyes.  
当她将双手滑入他的衬衫下，温柔地用手指抚过他的腹部，向上至胸膛时，他的思绪停止了运转。她将双唇贴上他的，闭上了眼睛。  
  
'Is she... Oh god, who cares...'  
'她是在...哦天哪，管他呢...'  
  
He shut his eyes slowly, not moving any other part of his body, he wanted to savor this moment, even if it was just a moment. Because in this moment that he felt her pressed close to him, the feelings of sadness and pain, the horrible memories that plagued his mind and his dreams vanished. And in that instant, so did the longing. It was satisfied by the arms that were now holding him, the body pressed against his, the lips pressing his and the heat coming from the combined exhales of the two.  
他缓缓闭上眼睛，身体其他部位纹丝不动，他想细细品味这一刻，即便只是转瞬即逝。因为在这一刻，她紧贴着他，那些悲伤与痛苦的感觉，那些困扰他心灵和梦境的可怕记忆都消失了。就在那一瞬间，渴望也随之消散。此刻拥抱着他的双臂、紧贴着他的身躯、轻吻着他的唇瓣以及两人共同呼出的温暖气息，满足了那份渴望。  
  
But also in this moment, he felt hands wrap around his neck. Palms that felt so warm before were now ice cold, and forcing themselves shut. No words came from either, only muffled gasps for air from him as he tried to push her off.  
但就在这一刻，他感到双手环绕在他的脖颈上。曾经温暖如春的掌心此刻却冰冷如霜，并强行紧闭。两人都没有说话，只有他试图推开她时发出的窒息般的喘息声。  
  
'Asuka, stop this... Please... Please...'  
'明日香，停下来吧...求你了...求你了...'  
  
A tear made its way down his cheek as he began to feel the life slipping out of him, and he began to panic. He kicked and tried to swing his arms, and pleaded to her in his mind to release her grip. Shinji felt numb and cold, the feeling he had tried to avoid throughout his life was now going to be the last he would ever experience. This thought alone caused him to concentrate a last effort to free himself. He let his energy take control of the now weak body and Shinji's mind surged. He focused all of his remaining strength into his right arm and swung upward at her face as his mind screamed.  
一滴泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落，他开始感觉到生命正从体内流逝，恐慌随之而来。他踢腿挣扎，试图挥动手臂，在心中向她恳求松开束缚。真嗣感到麻木和寒冷，这种他一生都在试图逃避的感觉，如今将成为他最后的体验。仅是这个念头就促使他集中最后的力量试图自救。他让能量掌控此刻虚弱的身体，真嗣的意识猛然涌动。他将所有剩余的力量集中在右臂，向上挥拳击向她的脸庞，同时内心嘶吼。  
  
'Care for me!' 'Warm me!' 'Hold me!' 'Need me!'  
'关心我！' '温暖我！' '拥抱我！' '需要我！'  
  
Shinji shot up in his bed.  
真嗣猛地从床上坐起。  
  
"LOVE ME, ASUKA!" "爱我，明日香！"  
  
Gasping for air and feeling his throat delicately, Shinji determined that he was fine. There were no hands suffocating him. There were no hands tenderly rubbing his chest, there were no lips pressed against his, there was no loving comfort. There was no Asuka leaned over him.  
喘息着，小心翼翼地感受着喉咙，真嗣确定自己没事。没有双手在扼杀他。没有双手温柔地抚摸他的胸膛，没有双唇紧贴着他的，没有爱的安慰。没有明日香俯身在他上方。  
  
Shinji felt the sweat rolling down his forehead and the dampness that remained in the outline of his form from this dream. He felt his heart pounding within his chest as he tried to calm himself.  
真嗣感觉到汗水从额头滚落，以及梦中留下的身体轮廓的潮湿。他感到自己的心脏在胸腔内狂跳，试图让自己平静下来。  
  
"A dream.... A nightmare..." he whispered to himself.  
“一个梦……一场噩梦……”他低声自语。  
  
He fell back onto his pillow, tired and worn, hoping nobody had heard him yell just then. Especially Asuka. He figured that if she hadn't come barging into his room to kick him, beat him, or both, then she was still fast asleep. Shinji chuckled slightly as he drifted off to sleep once more.  
他疲惫不堪地倒回枕头上，希望刚才没有人听到他的喊叫，尤其是明日香。他想，如果她没有冲进他的房间来踢他、揍他，或者两者兼施，那么她应该还在熟睡中。真嗣轻笑一声，再次沉沉睡去。  
  
- The Next Morning -  
- 第二天早晨 -  
  
Shinji awoke to quiet, wondering what time it was, he looked over to the small watch on the dresser next to his bed. Misato thought he needed a dresser so that he wouldn't roll over onto his SDAT player while he was sleeping, like he had once, damaging it and leaving the small player in need of repair.  
真嗣在一片寂静中醒来，想知道现在是什么时间，他转头看向床边小梳妆台上放着的表。美里认为他需要一个梳妆台，这样他就不会在睡觉时翻身压到 SDAT 播放器，就像他曾经那样，损坏了播放器，使得这个小设备需要修理。  
  
'How kind of her...' “她真是体贴...”  
  
He saw that he was right on time, but didn't know why it was so quiet and still in the apartment. Climbing out of bed, he put the watch on, and then proceeded to get dressed for school so that Asuka wouldn't awake to see her lunch not made. Remembering his nightmare, he got dressed a little faster.  
他看到自己正好准时，但不知道为什么公寓里如此安静和寂静。他爬出床，戴上手表，然后开始穿校服，以免明日香醒来时发现午餐还没准备好。想起那个噩梦，他穿衣服的速度加快了一些。  
  
When he slid open his door, Asuka was silently sitting at the table across from Misato, who was indulging in her usual morning beer. Shinji glanced at Asuka, trying to look into her eyes for no reason in particular, or so he thought to himself. The two noticed him and Asuka strangely said nothing. He awaited a barrage of insults and yelling from the third child, but none came. This was indeed surprising. Misato finished her can and stood up to wish Shinji a good morning. But his face instantly flushed red. In clear view of him were Misato's bare legs, her thighs. The crisp skin, radiant in his eyes. As he looked up, he noticed that Misato was wearing nothing but her underwear below her waist, and nothing except a small shirt above. Noticing this caused his cheeks to burn, he must have been as red as a cherry by now, and he was noticeably, although not admittedly, quite aroused by the sight. Shinji shook the thoughts of his guardian out of his mind, he forced the lustful visions out of his head, he knew it was wrong to think about her in this way. Not to say that he didn't like doing it.  
当他拉开自己的房门时，明日香正静静地坐在桌子对面，而美里则在享受她惯常的早间啤酒。真嗣瞥了明日香一眼，试图无端地窥视她的眼睛，至少他是这么对自己说的。两人注意到了他，但明日香却出奇地一言不发。他等待着第三适格者的辱骂和咆哮，却什么也没发生。这确实令人惊讶。美里喝完她的啤酒罐，站起来向真嗣道早安。但他的脸瞬间涨得通红。在他眼前清晰可见的是美里的裸腿，她的大腿。那光洁的皮肤，在他眼中闪耀着光芒。当他抬头时，他注意到美里腰部以下只穿着内裤，腰部以上只穿了一件小衬衫。注意到这一点让他的脸颊发烫，他现在一定红得像颗樱桃，而且明显地，虽然不承认，他对这景象相当兴奋。真嗣摇了摇头，将关于监护人的这些念头赶出脑海，他强迫自己把那些色情的画面从脑海中驱逐出去，他知道这样想她是不对的。并不是说他不喜欢这样做。  
  
"Shinjiii-kuuun, is every.. thing... allllhrighht?" Misato finally spoke up, slurring badly.  
“真～嗣～君，一～切～都～好～吗？”美里终于开口了，口齿不清地问道。  
  
He avoided eye-contact with his rather scantly-clad guardian as he replied, and then kept his view off of her while moving to sit down at the table. Misato, finally realizing her mistake in forgetting to get properly clothed, quickly walked back to her room to change. Asuka stopped sipping her drink and set it down on the table, then broke the silence.  
他避开与衣着相当单薄的监护人眼神接触，回答后便移开视线，走向餐桌坐下。美里终于意识到自己忘了换上合适的衣服，急忙走回房间更换。明日香停止啜饮，将饮料放在桌上，打破了沉默。  
  
"I heard you last night, third child."  
“昨晚我听到你了，第三适格者。”  
  
Shinji immediately choked on his drink and felt it burn up through his nostrils. What could he say? Were there words to get himself out of this one? Should he just give in and admit that it was him? Would she care? Shinji cleared his throat, attempting to stall for time but also realizing that Asuka knew full well what he was doing. When his throat was cleared well enough, or more than well enough, he spoke.  
真嗣立刻呛到了，饮料从鼻孔中喷出。他该说什么？有办法摆脱这个局面吗？是否应该直接承认就是他？她会在意吗？真嗣清了清喉咙，试图拖延时间，同时也意识到明日香完全清楚他在做什么。当喉咙清理得足够好，或者说过于好了，他开口了。  
  
"I... Asu..." Shinji struggled to get out.  
"我... 明日香..." 真嗣挣扎着说出口。  
  
'What can I say to her,' he thought, 'will she see that I'm lying...'  
'我该对她说些什么呢，' 他心想，'她会看出我在撒谎吗...'  
  
Asuka was sitting still in her chair not moving, and fixing her gaze on him with a cold stare. But there was something else also, something in her eyes, so faint but still visible to Shinji. He was caught up in a whirlwind of thoughts and worries, thinking of the many possible ways this could end, good and bad, and worse than the latter but no better than the former.  
明日香静静地坐在椅子上，一动不动，用冰冷的目光盯着他。但她的眼中还有别的东西，虽然微弱但仍能被真嗣察觉。他陷入了一连串的思绪和忧虑中，想象着这件事可能的各种结局，有好有坏，甚至更糟，但没有比之前更好的。  
  
"I'm sorry for waking you..." Shinji finally managed to say, his voice trembling slightly, hoping that this would satisfy the second child.  
"对不起，吵醒你了……" 真嗣终于说道，声音微微颤抖，希望这样能让二号机驾驶员满意。  
  
"Baka." Asuka mumbled. "笨蛋。" 明日香咕哝道。  
  
"I had better not catch you fantasizing about me again, you pervert!" She then added.  
"你最好别再对我有什么幻想了，变态！" 她接着说道。  
  
Shinji was half relieved and half stunned and shocked, and slightly worried. Yes he had fantasized about her, many times, he had actually brought himself pleasure to thoughts of her before. But last night was not one of those times, it was different. Shinji then felt his face flush as he thought of the view of her breasts he had gotten every so often, which translated itself into the dream. She hated him, he knew. He would always feel alone after he had climaxed in his bed, he knew that masturbating to thoughts of HER wouldn't make him feel any better, at least not for very long. He had still found pleasure in these thoughts though, and always regretted doing it because when the release was over, Shinji was alone in his room. No Asuka to warm his heart.  
真嗣感到一半的释然，一半的震惊和惊愕，还有些许担忧。是的，他曾多次幻想她，甚至因此获得过快感。但昨晚并非如此，情况不同。真嗣随即感到脸颊发烫，回想起偶尔瞥见的她的胸部，这些画面转化成了梦境。他知道她恨他。每次在床上达到高潮后，他总会感到孤独，他明白对着她的幻想自慰不会让他感觉好些，至少不会持续太久。尽管如此，他仍从这些幻想中找到了乐趣，但事后总是后悔，因为释放过后，真嗣独自一人在房间里。没有明日香来温暖他的心。  
  
'Not like she ever would.' Shinji thought to himself.  
'她才不会那样。' 真嗣自言自语道。  
  
He knew that she despised him, his being, who he was and who he will always be. There were moments when Shinji started to feel something, some positive aura flowing from her. Like she was trying to communicate to him, but she couldn't say it to him, she couldn't let her mighty wall that she had built for herself come crumbling down, especially for him.  
他知道她鄙视他，他的存在，他的本质，以及他将永远成为的样子。有时真嗣开始感觉到一些积极的气息从她身上散发出来，仿佛她在试图与他沟通，但她无法说出口，她无法让自己建立的强大壁垒崩塌，尤其是为了他。  
  
'What a baka!' Asuka thought to herself, cringing.  
“真是个笨蛋！”明日香暗自想着，皱起了眉头。  
  
'I don't love him, nor could I ever love someone so weak and pathetic!' She then mentally added.  
“我不爱他，也不可能爱上这么软弱无能的人！”她在心里补充道。  
  
But these thoughts, they felt so out of place to her now. She remembered a time when she would thoroughly enjoy putting him down, beating his pitiful soul down to where it belonged. That time was gone. Asuka had seen something in the second child, something that she barely noticed, and wouldn't have even realized if he hadn't have saved her after the defeat of the eighth angel.  
但这些想法，现在对她来说显得如此格格不入。她记得曾经有一段时间，她会乐此不疲地贬低他，将他那可怜的灵魂打压到应有的位置。那样的时光已经一去不复返了。明日香在第二适格者身上看到了一些东西，一些她几乎未曾注意到的东西，如果不是他在第八使徒被击败后救了她，她甚至不会意识到这一点。  
  
'Or... could I?' “或者……我可以吗？”  
  
Recoiling at her mind, Asuka quickly stood up and rushed out of the apartment, forgetting her lunch. Shinji was left alone at the table, sitting alone with his eyes fixated in the place where Asuka's gaze met his mere seconds ago.  
被自己的想法吓到，明日香迅速起身冲出了公寓，忘了带走她的午餐。真嗣独自留在桌前，目光定格在几秒钟前与明日香视线交汇的地方。  
  
Misato, now fully dressed, slowly sauntered over to the table in the spot across from Shinji.  
美里此时已穿戴整齐，缓缓踱步到真嗣对面的位置坐下。  
  
"Shinjhi... kun..." "真嗣...君..."  
  
The third child merely stood up and slowly made his way out of the door, leaving Misato alone in her drunken state.  
第三个孩子只是站起身来，慢慢地走出门去，留下美里独自在她醉酒的状态中。  
  
'Hopefully she'll come out of it and realize that we've gone to school.' Shinji thought as he walked down the path to the high school, alone. No Asuka to accompany him. No Asuka to warm his heart.  
'希望她能清醒过来，意识到我们已经去上学了。' 真嗣一边沿着通往高中的小路走着，一边想着，独自一人。没有明日香陪伴他。没有明日香来温暖他的心。  
  
'She never would.' He thought to himself.  
'她永远不会那样做的。' 他暗自思忖。

This is an experimental chapter, mainly to get me back into writing. I have many more ideas to continue, just not a whole bunch of time to write. I'll see how this is reviewed and continue as I see fit, but I will continue it, and the rating posted will be set for the next chapter.  
这是一篇实验性的chapter，主要是为了让我重新找回写作的感觉。我还有很多想法可以继续发展，只是没有太多时间来写。我会根据这篇的反响来决定是否继续，但我一定会继续下去，并且发布的评级将适用于下一篇chapter。

嘿，这是个不错的开始，我还没见过多少故事是从梦境（或噩梦）开始的，我喜欢这种设定，期待未来能看到更多

[Warlordess](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/258238/Warlordess): **Sniffle** I luv this fic. Very sweet and sad and Shinji/Asuka (my current fetish). I hope you plan on continuing this soon. I see that it's been a few months... Still, you make it look so easy to write it. I could never; their characterizations are too hard to handle. Still, my dependence on you peoples is what keeps my luv for S/A brewing. Ignoring that, I still wish for you to continue. :) -Chibi  
**抽泣** 我超爱这篇文。既甜蜜又悲伤，还有真嗣/明日香（我现在的迷恋）。希望你计划尽快继续更新。我看已经过去几个月了... 不过，你写得看起来那么轻松。我可做不到；他们的性格太难把握了。尽管如此，我对你们这些作者的依赖，正是我热爱 S/A 的源泉。抛开这些不谈，我还是希望你能继续写下去。 :) -Chibi
