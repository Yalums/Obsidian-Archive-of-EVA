I will look you in the eye
我会直视你的双眼

"I feel sick." She murmured, looking away.
"我有点难受。"她轻声说着，目光移向别处。

He released her, his hands falling away from her slender neck, and cried. His hot tears fell on her face, and she glanced up.
他松开手，从她纤细的脖颈上撤回双手，泪水夺眶而出。滚烫的泪珠滴落在她脸上，她不由得抬头望去。

"This is the end, isn't it?" She ran a hand over the white bandages on her other arm, and he was struck by a memory—a bandage on the pale skin of another girl.
"这便是终结了吧？"她轻抚着另一只手臂上的白色绷带，他脑海中蓦然浮现出一段记忆——另一名女孩苍白肌肤上的绷带。

"Ayanami Rei." He whispered, mentally comparing her to the girl beneath him. Why were they so similar now—now that Rei was gone (dead or worse, who knew?) and the girl beneath him was the only other survivor besides himself?
"绫波丽。" 他轻声呢喃，内心将她与身下的女孩作比。为何她们如今这般相像——绫波丽已不在（是死了还是更糟，无人知晓），而身下的女孩成了除他之外仅存的幸存者？

"Why did you say her name?" the girl asked, rubbing her neck unconsciously. He saw her motions, and felt ashamed.
"你为什么提起她的名字？"女孩边问边无意识地揉着脖子。他注意到她的举动，心中涌起一阵羞愧。

"She sacrificed herself so that we could live."
她牺牲了自己，让我们得以生存。

"We were her children." The girl looked around, noticing their dead surroundings for the first time. One finger traced a red welt on the white skin of her neck, and she looked up.
"我们是她的孩子。"女孩环顾四周，首次察觉到周围一片死寂。她用一根手指轻抚着颈上那道红肿的痕迹，随后抬头望向远方。

"You did this to me?" she asked quietly.
"你竟然这样对我？"她低声问道。

He remembered the feel of her neck under his hands, the release of his anger and hate as he squeezed the life out of her and nodded.
他回忆起双手紧握她脖颈的感觉，随着他用力扼杀她的生命，心中的愤怒与仇恨随之释放，他微微点头。

"You hate me." She stated, and tried not to cry. When he did not answer, she said, "Very well," and moved out from under him.
"你讨厌我。"她语气坚定，强忍泪水。见他没有反应，她淡淡地说："那好吧，"随即从他身旁挪开。

"Asuka—" Asuka—

"Be quiet." She snapped, the anger within her coming out now, as the remnants of his faded, and died away. "You were strangling me."
别出声。" 她怒气冲冲地说，她的怒火此时爆发出来，而他残留的怒气已逐渐消散，最终归于平静。"你刚才差点掐死我。

"Yes." He refused to lie.
"是的。"他拒绝撒谎。

"So you hate me." 看来你很讨厌我。

Asuka's logic, though flawed, was said in a way that made it difficult for him to answer. So he didn't and she wept alone. He stood, listening to her sobs, and wished he knew what to do. His mind, battered after starting and then aborting the Third Impact, was unable to cope with Asuka's female reasoning. When she had swallowed the last sobs, he shifted his weight, ready to try and speak with her. Before he could move, though, she launched at him, hitting him square in the chest. They fell together to the sand, kneeling, her hands wrapped around his neck. He looked away.
尽管明日香的逻辑存在瑕疵，但她的话语方式让他难以反驳。因此，他选择了沉默，留下她独自泪流。他站立一旁，倾听着她的哭泣，内心渴望知道如何是好。经历了启动与中止第三次冲击的折磨，他的心智已不堪重负，无法领会明日香的女子心思。待她止住哭泣，他调整了姿态，打算尝试与她沟通。然而，未等他开口，她已冲向他，一拳重重击中他的胸膛。两人一同跌坐在沙地上，她双手紧扼他的脖颈。他避开了视线。

"A weakling to the end." Asuka whispered. "I shall kill you now. You hate me, and I can't let you live knowing that."
终究是个弱者。" 明日香低语道，"我这就送你上路。既然你如此恨我，我怎能容你存活于世。

"I don't…hate you…" he struggled to say.
"我并不…恨你…"他艰难地说道。

"Shut up!" Asuka's grip tightened, as she wept again. Her cold tears, so unlike his, ran down his cheeks, over her knuckles, and pooled in the hollow of his throat.
"闭嘴！" 明日香的手抓得更紧了，泪水再次涌出。她那冰冷的泪水，与他的不同，顺着他的脸颊流过她的手指，积聚在他颈部的凹陷处。

"You'll be alone…" he said, and she cried harder.
"你会孤单一人…"他这样说，她哭得更加伤心了。

"I can't let you live." She replied through her tears. "Shinji Ikari." She spat his name, a bitter taste in her mouth.
"我不能让你活着。"她泪眼婆娑地回应，"碇真嗣。"她厌恶地吐出这个名字，口中尽是苦涩。

Shinji looked up, his eyes meeting hers, and Asuka flinched. She didn't see the accusations, the hate, or the anger she expected; instead, forgiving and something unreadable glowed in his eyes, warm and so very alive.
真嗣抬起头，两人的目光交汇，明日香不由得退缩了一下。她并未见到预期的指责、憎恨或怒火；取而代之的是，他的眼中流露出宽恕之情，以及一种难以言明的光芒，温暖且生机勃勃。

If you were to kill me now
若你现在将我置于死地

Right here I would still
此时此地，我依旧

Look you in the eye
直视你的双眼

"Stop, stop!" Asuka tried to tear her gaze from his, but he held onto her, still staring into her blue orbs. "Don't look at me."
停下，停下！" 明日香努力想从他的目光中挣脱，但他紧握不放，依旧深深地凝视着她那双蓝色的眼睛。"别这样看着我。

"I can't stop." Shinji said softly, drinking in her face.
"我无法停止。" 真嗣柔声说着，目光紧紧地停留在她的脸上。

A slow blush spread across her cheeks, chipping away at the anger inside. She turned her head slightly, and a sudden pain shot through her neck. Memories of her mother's death cracked in her mind, and her anger flared up once more.
她脸颊上缓缓泛起红晕，心中的怒气随之消散。她稍稍转头，颈间突感一阵剧痛。母亲逝世的记忆在心头裂开，怒火再次熊熊燃起。

"Die." She whispered. "去死。" 她轻声细语。

And I would burn myself
我会自焚

Into your memory 融入你的记忆中

As long as you were still alive
只要你仍然活着

"You'll…be…alone…" he repeated, gasping through her deathgrip.
"你将...独自...一人..." 他断断续续地说着，艰难地从她的紧握中喘息。

"I will forget you, and then I won't feel alone."
我会将你遗忘，那样我就不会感到孤单。

"You won't be able to forget me." Shinji smiled slightly. "Until the day you die."
你忘不了我的。" 真嗣浅笑道。"直到你生命终结。

"I will…I will…" she snarled. "Weakling."
我就要…我就要…"她怒吼着。"胆小鬼。

"I am not weak." His voice seemed stronger now, despite the strength of her grip. "I'm letting you kill me, aren't I?"
我并非软弱。"尽管她紧握不放，他的声音却显得更加坚定。"我这不是在任由你杀我吗？

"Letting me…" Asuka's lovely face distorted in anger. "You are letting me?!"
让我……" 明日香那张可爱的脸因愤怒而变得扭曲。"你这是在让我吗?!

"Yes." 是的。

I would live inside of you
我愿与你融为一体

I'd make you wear me like a scar
我会让你将我如同伤痕般铭刻于身

"You'd never forget…" he winced, and arched his neck under her hands. "You'd…you'd remember me…always."
你绝不会忘记…"他皱着眉，在她双手的触碰下仰起脖子。"你…你会永远记得我。

"No."

"Always." Shinji promised.
"永远。" 真嗣承诺道。

And I would burn myself
我会自焚

Into your memory 融入你的记忆之中

And run through everything you are
贯穿你的全部

"You won't be able to forget, Asuka, I'll be with you, alive in your memory. You'd see me every day…" His words were choked off.
"你忘不了我的，明日香，我会活在你的记忆里，与你同在。你每天都会见到我……" 他的话语哽在喉间。

"Liar, liar." Asuka hissed. "Baka, you don't know anything."
骗子，骗子。" 明日香低声斥责。"傻瓜，你一无所知。

"I know what happened to your mother, I know how I am the same as she in your eyes."
我了解你母亲的遭遇，也明白在你看来我和她有着相似之处。

"Liar, liar." She repeated, but her voice lacked conviction. Her grip loosened.
"骗子，骗子。" 她再次说道，但语气中已无坚定。她的手渐渐松开了。

He said nothing, just waited.
他一言不发，只是静静等待。

Asuka removed her hands, leaning back, her eyes half closed.
明日香松开手，身体微微后仰，双眼半闭着。

"Well?" She asked mockingly. He didn't move. "Aren't you going to run away like always, you baka?"
怎么样？"她带着嘲弄的口吻问道。他依旧纹丝不动。"这次不打算像平时那样逃之夭夭了吗，傻瓜？

Shinji smiled. 真嗣露出了微笑。

I would not run 我不会逃跑

I would not turn 我不会回头

I would not hide 我不会隐瞒

She waited impatiently. "You always run away, like a weakling. You run from your problems, you hide from the truth. Aren't you going to try and escape me?"
她焦急地等待着，说道：“你总是逃避，像个懦夫一样。你逃避问题，躲避真相。难道你就不打算试着摆脱我吗？”

"I won't leave." Shinji said calmly.
"我不会离开。" 真嗣镇定地说。

"You will!" her voice rose. "You will leave me, just like everyone else!"
你肯定会离开的！"她声音提高，"就像其他人一样，你也会离我而去！

"No."

I would not run 我不会逃跑

I would not turn 我不会转过去

I would not hide 我不会隐瞒

"You will leave me. I can't let that happen." Asuka insisted. "So I have to kill you."
你会离开我，我绝不允许。" 明日香坚决地说，"因此，我必须除掉你。

"Okay." 好的。

Her hands fastened around his neck again. He offered no resistance.
她双手再次紧箍住他的脖子，而他并未反抗。

"Fight me." 来较量一下。

"Why?" Shinji questioned, forcing her to look at him.
"为什么？" 真嗣追问，让她不得不直视他。

"I want to know that I won. Then I'll forget you, like I forgot Mama until that Angel reminded me, and I'll be okay, I'll be okay." Her tears had returned, running in paths down the curve of her cheeks, and landing on his skin.
"我渴望确认自己的胜利。之后，我会像遗忘母亲那样将你抛诸脑后，直到那位天使的提醒让我记起，那时我会安然无恙。" 她的泪水再次滑落，沿着脸颊的弧线滴落，触碰他的肌肤。

I would live inside of you
我愿与你融为一体

I'd make you wear me like a scar
我会让你将我如同伤痕般铭刻于身

And I would burn myself
我会自焚

Into your memory 融入你的记忆之中

And run through everything you are
贯穿你的全部

"You would never forget." He said stubbornly, showing a bit of that determined nerve that blazed in his body when he fought. His eyes flashed.
"你绝不会忘记。"他坚定地说，眼中闪烁着战斗时那种决然的勇气。

"Yes, I would." 是的，我愿意。

"No. The memory of me would live forever, and you would know, over and over, how you killed the last other human, and why you are alone."
不，我的记忆将永存于世，你会反复意识到，是你亲手终结了最后一个人类的生命，以及你孤独的缘由。

"NO!" The concept of that loneliness, of that guilt and regret, frightened Asuka more than she would have thought possible.
"不！"那种孤独感、内疚与悔恨交织的情感，令明日香感到前所未有的恐惧。

"Look me in the eye, Asuka, and then kill me." He raised his hands, gently cupping her face, and made her look down at him.
"明日香，看着我的眼睛，然后结束我的生命。" 他双手轻柔地托起她的脸颊，引导她俯视自己。

If you were to kill me now
若你现在将我置于死地

Right here I would still
此时此地，我依旧

Look you in the eye
看着你的眼睛

And I would burn myself
我会自焚

Into your memory 融入你的记忆中

As long as you were still alive
只要你仍然活着

"I can't…" her grip loosened again, and he breathed in gratefully.
"我做不到…" 她的手劲再次松懈，他如释重负地深吸一口气。

"Why not?" 何乐而不为？

"I don't know." Asuka lied. She knew, but how could she explain that strange, compelling look in his eyes—warm and benevolent, and so innocent? He couldn't see his own eyes, how they glowed with an inner fire. As long as he looked at her, she couldn't hurt him.
"我不清楚。" 明日香撒了谎。她其实明白，但如何描述他眼中那股奇异而吸引人的温暖与善意，以及那份纯真？他自己看不见，他的眼睛里闪烁着内在的光辉。只要他注视着她，她就无法对他造成伤害。

"Yes you do." His voice reminded her of a teacher or a parent, gentle but firm.
"没错，你确实如此。"他的声音带着老师或父母般的温和与坚定。

"I…I don't want to be alone." That was true, yes—all she wanted was to be with someone…with him.
"我…我真的不想孤单。" 确实如此，她内心深处只渴望有人相伴…尤其是他。

"I know." 我明白。

"Why don't you hate me?" Her hands fell to his chest, clutching at the fabric of his shirt.
"你为何不恨我呢？"她双手搭在他的胸膛，紧抓着他衬衫的布料。

"How could I?" 我怎么可能做到呢？

"No one could love me…I'm so mean…always mocking you, always making fun of you…just because I knew that you were better than me." She whispered.
"没人会爱我…我太刻薄了…总是嘲讽你，总是取笑你…只因我深知你比我更出色。" 她轻声细语。

"I'm only better than you because I was meant to start the Third Impact." He paused, stroking her hair unconsciously. "You are not as unlovable as you think." She whimpered against his palm. "You also aren't as aloof as you think. I knew how you acted superior, perfect, confident, just to hide how you really felt. You were lying to me, Asuka, but I still saw the truth."
我之所以比你更胜一筹，是因为我注定要启动第三次冲击。"他顿了顿，不经意间抚摸着她的秀发。"你并非如你所想的那般不值得被爱。"她在他掌中轻声啜泣。"你也并非如你所想的那般冷漠。我明白你故作高傲、完美、自信，不过是为了掩盖内心的真实感受。明日香，你在对我撒谎，但我依然洞悉了真相。

"Why did you change? You were never this strong." She felt the answer would be important—something had happened to Shinji, and she wanted to know what.
"你怎么变了？以前你从没这么坚强过。"她深感答案至关重要——真嗣身上一定发生了什么，她迫切想要了解。

That faint smile played around his mouth again. "I killed all of mankind, nearly destroyed the world…there isn't much I'm afraid of now."
他嘴角又浮现出那抹淡淡的微笑。“我几乎屠尽了全人类，险些让世界毁于一旦……如今，已没有什么能让我畏惧。”

"Oh." Asuka rested her head against his shoulder. His arms tightened around her, and he laid his cheek on her head, running a red lock through his fingers. She closed her eyes, trying to remember when she had broken away from his hypnotic eyes—and when those ordinary brown eyes had gotten to be so powerful. Shinji had changed, but it was a change he had been making for all the time she'd known him, not something sudden. The weak exterior had simply finally fallen to the strength he hid within.
"哦。" 明日香将头倚在他的肩上。他的双臂紧拥着她，脸颊轻贴她的头顶，指间捻弄着一缕红发。她闭上双眼，努力回想何时从他那摄人心魄的眼神中挣脱，以及那双平凡的棕色眼眸何时变得如此深邃。真嗣确实变了，但这变化是渐进的，自她认识他以来一直在悄然发生，而非一蹴而就。他那看似脆弱的外壳，终究还是被内在的坚韧所取代。

"You are lovable." He said randomly, interrupting her thoughts.
"你真可爱。"他突然冒出这么一句，打断了她的思绪。

"I am?" Asuka wanted to believe him.
"我真的是吗？" 明日香渴望相信他的话。

"Yes." 是的。

"Prove it." she challenged.
"证明给我看。"她挑衅地说。

He placed two fingers under her chin and lifted her head. She felt like she was drowning in his eyes. Asuka closed her eyelids, enjoying the feather-light brush of her lashes on her cheek. And then his lips were on hers, and all her sadness seemed to vanish at his touch. His kiss was nothing like the one they'd shared, "to kill time", as she'd said then. It was slow and gentle, and was all the proof she needed. Her arms locked around his neck, no longer strangling, but instead embracing, her fingers caressing his hair rather than choking out his life.
他用两指轻托她的下巴，抬起她的头。她仿佛沉溺于他的眼眸之中。明日香闭上眼，感受着睫毛轻触脸颊的温柔。紧接着，他的唇贴上了她的，所有的悲伤似乎都在他的触碰下烟消云散。这个吻与他们之前那个“消磨时光”的吻大相径庭。它是如此缓慢而温柔，足以证明一切。她的双臂环绕他的颈项，不再是紧勒，而是拥抱，手指轻柔地抚过他的发丝，而非扼杀他的生机。

"Do you love me?" 你爱我吗？

Shinji smiled again, and she saw yet another change. His smile had grown from a tentative thing to a confident and trusting gesture. "Yes." One simple word that turned her world upside down, filling her with happiness.
真嗣再次露出微笑，她又察觉到了变化。他的笑容已从最初的犹豫不决，转变为充满自信和信任的表达。"是的。"这简短的一个词，却彻底颠覆了她的世界，让她心中充满了幸福。

"And you won't leave me?"
你不会离开我吧？

"Never." He promised, and bent to kiss her again.
"绝不会。"他承诺着，再次俯身亲吻她。

She pulled away slightly, angling her head downward so that he couldn't steal her lips again. "How will I know that you aren't lying?"
她稍稍后撤，低头调整头部角度，以防他再次偷吻。“我怎么确定你没说谎？”

He smiled affectionately, and turned her face upwards again. His eyes glowed with love, and Asuka knew the answer before he spoke. "Look me in the eye."
他温柔地笑了，再次将她的脸庞抬起。他的眼眸中满是爱意，明日香在他开口前便已心领神会。"直视我的眼睛。"

She smiled back, reassured. If the warmth in his eyes disappeared, then she would know. "I'll look you in the eye," she agreed.
她回以微笑，心感踏实。若他眼中的暖意消散，她便能察觉。“我会直视你的眼睛，”她应允道。

Shinji laughed, a low, comforting sound, and Asuka knew she'd never be alone again.
真嗣发出低沉而抚慰人心的笑声，明日香明白，她将不再孤单。

I would not run 我不会逃跑

I would not turn 我不会转过去

I would not hide 我不会隐瞒

In the eye 在眼里

In the eye 在眼里

Look me in the eye
直视我的眼睛
