Before Arael, Shinji has one final chance to recover Asuka from her downward spiral. (updated with Extended version)  
在面对亚拉尔之前，真嗣有最后一次机会将明日香从她的堕落中拯救出来。（更新了扩展版）

---

_She's pretty._ Shinji thought again, seeing Asuka from behind in her sleeveless shirt and blue skirt. It wasn't the first time he caught himself admiring her when she wasn't looking. She was on the phone, responding to her mother.  
她真漂亮。真嗣再次这样想，从背后看到穿着无袖衬衫和蓝色裙子的明日香。这已不是他第一次在她不注意时偷偷欣赏她了。她正在打电话，回应着她的母亲。

Her hand folded on the small of her back flexed. It was arrayed, like a claw, grabbing at him. _What if she held my hand during her call?_  
她放在腰后方的手紧握成爪状，仿佛要抓住他。如果她在打电话时握住我的手，会怎样呢？

This time he followed that thought and looked down at his hand, imagining then what it would be like to be against her, holding hands…  
这次他顺着这个念头，低头看向自己的手，想象着与她紧握双手的感觉……

Asuka got off her international call just then.  
就在那时，明日香结束了她的国际通话。

"W-wow, a long call!" Shinji said as his wrist dropped.  
"哇，好长的电话啊！" 真嗣说着，手腕垂了下来。

Asuka turned to him. "It's only routine, nothing special."  
明日香转向他，"这只是例行公事，没什么特别的。"

"A call from family though, I'm envious. M-my mom isn't around to talk to anymore."  
"虽然是家里的电话，但我还是很羡慕。我...我妈妈已经不在了，没法再和她说话了。"

Asuka looked at him this time with clear eyes, then turned completely to face him as she said, "Well…this is… only for show. she isn't my real mother."  
明日香这次用清澈的眼神看着他，然后完全转过身来面对他说：“嗯……这只是……做做样子而已。她不是我的亲生母亲。”

"O-oh…" Shinji answered. “哦……” 真嗣回答道。

Asuka glanced at the phone. "It's not that I hate her, I just feel a little uncomfortable with her."  
明日香瞥了一眼手机。“并不是我讨厌她，只是和她在一起我有点不自在。”

Suddenly realizing how open she just was, her defenses came back up. "Why the hell am I telling you any of this?"  
突然意识到自己刚才有多坦白，她的防备心又回来了。“我干嘛要跟你说这些？”

"S-sorry I… I was just curious about your family. S-seems like both of us are-"  
“对、对不起，我……我只是对你家的事感到好奇。看来我们俩都……”

Asuka blew him off. "God, it really is rock bottom when I have sympathy from you!" She turned away.  
明日香打断了他。“天啊，我竟然要从你这里寻求同情，真是到了谷底了！”她转过身去。

"S-sorry…" was all Shinji could say as she crossed her arms in anger. It was a meek, inadequate thing, his apology.  
"对不起…" 是真嗣唯一能说的，她交叉双臂，怒气冲冲。他的道歉显得软弱无力，远远不够。

_Help her. 帮帮她。_

Shinji blinked, wondering where that thought came from. The last time he thought anything like this was when she stormed off, after being replaced by Rei during their synch training. Even then it wasn't as out of the blue as-  
真嗣眨了眨眼，不明白这念头从何而来。上一次他有这样的想法，是在同步训练中被绫波替换后，她愤然离去的时候。即便那时，也没有像现在这样突如其来——

"What are you staring at?!" Asuka barked at him. Her hands were on her hips now, anger directed at him.  
"你盯着看什么？！" 明日香对他吼道。她的双手叉在腰间，怒火直指他。

He blinked, surprised. 他眨了眨眼，感到惊讶。

_Help her. 帮帮她。_

"S…" his lips started to say but he knew she hated it when he said that. Instead, he swallowed. "I-i was just… thinking."  
“S…”他的嘴唇开始说，但他知道她讨厌他这么说。于是，他咽了咽口水。“我-我只是……在思考。”

"And you happened to be 'thinking' in my direction?" She replied, leaning up in anger.  
"“而你恰好‘思考’的方向是我这边？”她反问道，愤怒地挺直了身子。”

_She's wounded and she needs your help.  
她受伤了，需要你的帮助。_

Shinji blinked again, confused where these sentiments were coming from. But each thought was making him see Asuka a little differently- changing his understanding of her abrasiveness. For the first time that he's known her, he considered whether her hostility was because she was hurt. Like a wounded wild animal lashing out. Hurt how?  
真嗣再次眨了眨眼，困惑于这些情感从何而来。但每一个念头都让他对明日香的看法有所改变——改变了他对她尖锐性格的理解。自从认识她以来，他第一次考虑她的敌意是否因为她受伤了。就像一只受伤的野兽在反击。她是怎么受伤的呢？

It was making him both uncomfortable and sympathetic. He didn't know how to handle emotional distress- especially his own. But with each of these sweeps suddenly he was seeing her in a new light. And he felt compelled to help her.  
这让他既感到不安又心生同情。他不知道如何处理情感困扰——尤其是自己的。但随着这些突然的转变，他开始以新的眼光看待她。他感到有责任去帮助她。

"Y-yeah…" Shinji replied, "and uh…"  
"嗯…" 真嗣回答道，"然后…"

"And?" The redhead demanded, her patience wearing thin.  
"然后呢？" 红发女孩追问，耐心逐渐耗尽。

_The small of her back. Her fingers. Being close to her.  
她的腰背。她的手指。与她亲近的感觉。_

"Y-you just look nice….today…" he admitted aloud.  
"你今天看起来……挺好看的。" 他不由自主地大声承认道。

The silence in the room was practically tangible. Shinji had been staring at her legs but when he glanced up, her face was red with an expression Shinji couldn't read clearly. Anger? Embarrassment?  
房间里的沉默几乎触手可及。真嗣一直在盯着她的腿，但当他抬头时，她的脸涨得通红，表情让真嗣难以捉摸。是愤怒？还是尴尬？

"As if you're fit to judge!" Asuka barked, then she stormed down the hall to her room.  
"你有什么资格评判我！" 明日香厉声说道，随后怒气冲冲地走向自己的房间。

"Asuka!" Shinji called, but all he could see was her retreating back before she slammed the door. It opened again for her to throw the phone on the ground, then shut again.  
"明日香！" 真嗣呼唤着，但只看到她转身离去的背影，随后门砰的一声关上了。门再次打开，她将手机扔在地上，然后又重重地关上。

Misato grunted from behind her Beer. "Sheesh, take a compliment will you?"  
美里在啤酒杯后咕哝道："哎呀，接受个赞美有那么难吗？"

Shinji's feet patted down the hall to where the phone lay on the ground. He reached down to pick it up, then stared at Asuka's door.  
真嗣的脚步声在走廊里响起，走向躺在地上的手机。他弯腰捡起手机，然后凝视着明日香的房门。

_These doors have no locks. She's on the other side in earshot. You can say something.  
这些门没有锁。她在另一边，能听见你的声音。你可以开口说些什么。_

He stepped up to the door and hesitated. What did this new impulse in him want him to say?  
他走到门前，犹豫了一下。这突如其来的冲动想要他说些什么呢？

_Speak your mind. 说出你的心里话。_

"I wish more of our conversations could be like that." He said, "I'm not your enemy, Asuka. I just wish I knew the right way to say things so you wouldn't be so angry with me."  
"我希望我们的对话能更多地像那样。" 他说，"我不是你的敌人，明日香。我只是希望我能找到正确的方式来表达，这样你就不会对我那么生气了。"

Nothing. No voice, no response from Asuka. Sighing he headed back down the hall to return the phone, disappointed he probably wouldn't get to see her in that outfit again anytime soon.  
什么也没有。没有声音，明日香没有回应。他叹了口气，沿着走廊回去归还电话，失望地意识到可能不久的将来不会再看到她穿那套衣服了。

_Not unless you were closer to her.  
除非你更接近她。_

He was blushing as he returned the phone. Though Misato dropped some sarcastic quip, Shinji only barely acknowledged it before he walked to his room to do his Homework.  
他满脸通红地归还了手机。尽管美里说了些讽刺的话，真嗣只是勉强回应了一下，便走向自己的房间去做作业了。

---

The bath. Peaceful time for contemplation.  
浴室。宁静的沉思时光。

Her back. Her hips. Her curtain of red hair. The skirt. Fingers.  
她的背。她的腰。她那如瀑布般的红发。那条裙子。手指。

_Help her. 帮帮她。_

Shinji spoke to the ceiling. "Asuka's one of the strongest people I know. Why would I think she needs help?"  
真嗣对着天花板说道：“明日香是我认识的最坚强的人之一。我怎么会认为她需要帮助呢？”

_A wounded dog, barking and wailing as it is chained to a ditch, abandoned. Your teacher, coaxing the animal with a snack enticement. Patiently waiting. A gentle hand stretched out.  
一只受伤的狗，被拴在沟渠边，哀嚎着，被遗弃了。你的老师，用零食引诱着这只动物。耐心等待。一只温柔的手伸了出去。_

"It didn't bite." “它没有咬人。”

_Smooth hand against the red fur. Touching. The dog calms as Sensei pets.  
手掌轻抚着红色的毛皮。触摸。随着老师的抚摸，狗狗平静了下来。_

Touching. 触摸。

Shinji's hand came out of the water. He stared at it. "I don't think she wanted me to touch her. Though…" his hand rotated, "it would be nice to… touch her again."  
真嗣的手从水中伸出。他凝视着它。“我觉得她并不想让我触碰她。尽管……”他的手旋转着，“如果能再次触碰她，那该多好。”

_The Walls of Jericho. 耶利哥之墙。_

What _did_ that mean anyway?  
那到底是什么意思呢？

_The bra she leaned into your face has a zipper on the front. For you to grab and open.  
她凑到你面前的胸罩前襟有一个拉链，供你抓取并拉开。_

Shinji went red and let his face sink into the water while other parts of him reacted. "Why didn't I notice that until now?"  
真嗣脸红了，把脸埋进水里，而身体的其他部分则有了反应。\"为什么我到现在才注意到？\"

_Because you're terrified to try.  
因为你害怕去尝试。_

Shinji sat in the water.  
真嗣坐在水中。

_If there is no movement, nothing changes. And you remain on opposite shores. Alone.  
如果没有行动，一切都不会改变。而你仍将站在对岸。孤独一人。_

Shinji stared at the ripples in the water, wondering what caused them. "I don't want to be hurt."  
真嗣凝视着水面的涟漪，思索是什么引起的。“我不想受伤。”

_What do you have to lose if you try?  
尝试一下，你又有什么可失去的呢？_

Shinji blew bubbles from his mouth into the bath water. "She'd never speak to me again."  
真嗣在浴缸里吹着泡泡，心想：“她再也不会理我了。”

_That is certain if you remain on this path. If this is inevitable, you lose nothing by trying. But there is much to gain.  
如果你继续这样下去，那是肯定的。如果这是不可避免的，尝试一下你也不会失去什么。但有很多可以获得的。_

Shinji stared at the door.  
真嗣盯着门看。

_This is your_ last _chance._  
这是你最后的机会。

He got out of the bath. Shinji stared at the still water. The murkiness and scattered chipping on the bottom reminded him of the tepid plug water, weeks ago, when he was trapped in the white void.  
他从浴缸中起身，真嗣凝视着平静的水面。底部的浑浊和散落的剥落痕迹让他想起了几周前，被困在白色虚空中的温热插入栓水。

_Clean it for her. 帮她清理干净。_

He pulled the plug. For the next few minutes he watched the water drain. "It won't be warm for her."  
他拔掉了塞子。接下来的几分钟里，他看着水流走。‘这水对她来说不会暖和了。’

_But it won't be filled with the oily discards of your skin.  
但它不会充满你皮肤上的油腻残留物。_

Shinji left the bathroom. Misato called from her room as he passed, "Were you talking to yourself in there?"  
真嗣离开了浴室。当他经过时，美里从她的房间喊道：‘你在里面自言自语吗？’

"Yeah, I had to think." Shinji replied. Leaving it at that his feet padded for his room.  
"嗯，我得想想。" 真嗣回答道。留下这句话，他的脚步声朝着他的房间走去。

His fist stopped in the air halfway to where he usually knocked on her door. This was to signal the bath was free. He wondered if he should say anything more, but instead he said as he knocked on her door, "Bath is free."  
他的拳头停在半空中，那是他通常敲她门的位置，以此来表示浴室空出来了。他犹豫是否该多说些什么，但最终还是敲了敲门，说道："浴室空出来了。

She used to answer, but not this time. He turned to move away but decided to stop. He faced the door.  
"她以前总会回应，但这次没有。他转身欲走，却又停下脚步，重新面对着门。

"Goodnight, Asuka." "晚安，明日香。"

Nothing. No voice, no response from Asuka.  
什么也没有。没有声音，明日香没有任何回应。

He decided to leave it at that and retire for the night.  
他决定就这样算了，准备去睡觉。

---

Shinji lay awake in his darkened bedroom, listening to his thoughts. The intrusive impulses of earlier, during Asuka's call, were silent.  
真嗣躺在昏暗的卧室里，清醒地聆听着自己的思绪。之前在明日香来电时侵扰他的冲动已经平息。

He was thinking of her.  
他在想她。

The very suggestion that her anger was a product of some kind of pain, rather than simple malice, had set his mind on fire as he lay there. It stood to reason there could be a place where she was free of that pain, and perhaps, nicer. He wondered what that looked like. He wanted to see her happy.  
仅仅是提出她的愤怒可能是某种痛苦的产物，而非单纯的恶意，就让他躺在那里思绪如火。可以推断，存在一个她能摆脱那种痛苦的地方，或许，她会更和善。他好奇那会是什么样子。他希望看到她快乐。

He already had a crush on her for her looks, and admired her strength and drive as a pilot. These feelings were now mixing with his own sense of helping the weak and downtrodden. He could help Asuka, if he could figure out how. And maybe she would like him better. Maybe like him enough to…  
他早已因她的外貌而倾心，又钦佩她作为飞行员的力量与干劲。这些情感现在与他帮助弱者和受压迫者的本能交织在一起。如果他能找到方法，他可以帮助明日香。也许她会因此更喜欢他。也许喜欢到足以……

He rolled sideways on the bed as he considered her contradictions. She had threatened him on the last night of their sync training, yet she insisted on training with him. She went on a date with an older boy- being more of an adult- but didn't think anything of ditching it to come home to be with him. She had offered to kiss him, but only out of boredom, and was irritated when his breath tickled her. Signals both ways. It had been easier to stand his ground so as to not be a burden to her, too.  
他在床上侧身翻滚，思索着她的矛盾之处。她在最后一次同步训练的夜晚威胁过他，却又坚持要和他一起训练。她和一个年长的男孩出去约会——表现得更为成熟——却不以为意地为了回家和他在一起而爽约。她曾提出要吻他，但只是出于无聊，当他的呼吸轻触她时，她又感到恼火。信号错综复杂。他坚持立场，以免成为她的负担，这样似乎更容易些。

His fingers closed against the sheets into a fist. Well, even if it only meant an exit from this terminal amount of tension, Shinji wanted to help her. Of his own feelings he would continue to hope that, perhaps, someday she might notice his attempts to please her, small as they were until now.  
他的手指紧握床单，攥成拳头。即便只是为了从这个紧张局面中解脱出来，真嗣也想帮助她。至于他自己的感情，他将继续抱有希望，或许有一天，她会注意到他至今为止虽小却一直在努力取悦她的尝试。

He drifted off to sleep. He thought of when she dropped into the bed beside him that one time, and how he wished she did it on purpose.  
他渐渐入睡。他想起了那次她突然躺到他身边的床上，他多么希望她是故意的。

---

As Shinji tossed in his bed in the dark, a sphere the size of a basketball floated over his head. The black and white striped Shadow hung quietly, then shivered.  
在黑暗中，真嗣在床上辗转反侧，一个篮球大小的球体悬浮在他的头顶。黑白条纹的影子静静地悬挂着，然后颤抖了一下。

_I don't have much time left, Shinji. I'm going to help you as much as I can until the very end. Adam said this is what I should do.  
真嗣，我的时间不多了。我会尽我所能帮助你，直到最后一刻。亚当说这是我应该做的。_

Shinji's room was still and empty. The quiet air over the bed was void and cold. Shinji crunched inward a little in his sleep as he imagined embracing her.  
真嗣的房间静谧而空旷。床铺上方的空气空洞而寒冷。真嗣在睡梦中微微蜷缩，想象着拥抱着她。

**Splint 夹板**

_Piloting is the core of her identity.  
驾驶是她身份的核心。_

Shinji's eyes opened. He unfurled himself from the bed in the dark to process that thought. "I knew that."  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。他从黑暗中的床上舒展开来，处理着这个念头。“我知道的。”

_You surpassed her. She's a proud woman.  
你超越了她。她是个骄傲的女人。_

Shinji stared, groggily putting this together. His eyes widened a little. _Have I been hurting her?_  
真嗣凝视着，昏昏沉沉地将这些联系起来。他的眼睛微微睁大。我一直在伤害她吗？

_Help her! 救救她！_

---

Lately Shinji had been making breakfast then setting them out for Asuka and himself. Misato, these days, opted to start the day with microwave curry packets Shinji would find later on the counter. Dinner last night was the chance for things to improve; they hadn't. By all rights He should have kept doing what he was doing.  
最近，真嗣一直在做早餐，然后为明日香和自己摆好。这些天，美里选择以微波炉咖喱包开始新的一天，真嗣稍后会在台面上发现这些。昨晚的晚餐本应是改善关系的机会；但并没有。按理说，他应该继续做他正在做的事情。

This time he made their breakfasts and landed at the kitchen table to eat and wait. He would not be going to school today, instead he would be following his gut to help her.  
这次他做好了他们的早餐，坐在餐桌旁吃着等待。今天他不会去学校，而是要凭直觉去帮助她。

Asuka emerged in her school uniform and was taken aback to see Shinji not in his. Confused, she stepped into the room. "Not in uniform? What's wrong Third, playing hookie?"  
明日香穿着校服出现，却惊讶地看到真嗣没有穿校服。她困惑地走进房间，问道：“没穿校服？怎么了，第三适格者，逃学了？”

"Yeah." Shinji said dismissively, anger just behind his tone as he ate. Since he had decided to skip school today, he had worked himself up about how useless school was. It had been that way ever since he came to Tokyo-3. Even That notorious physics problem had been an exception rather than the norm. And with Toji gone and Kensuke pissed at him, there was no reason at all for him to be there.  
“是啊。”真嗣不屑地回答，语气中隐含着怒气，边吃边说。自从他决定今天逃学以来，他就一直在想学校是多么无用。自从他来到第三新东京市以来，一直都是这样。就连那个臭名昭著的物理问题也只是例外，并非常态。而且，随着东治的离开和健介对他的愤怒，他根本没有理由去学校。

Still confused, Asuka approached the kitchen table. "Think you're too good for school now too, huh, Shinji-sama?"  
依旧困惑的明日香走向餐桌，讽刺地说：“现在也觉得自己太了不起了，连学校都不屑一顾了吗，真嗣大人？”

_The school lectures are repetitive and nonsensical.  
学校的讲座重复且毫无意义。_

"I mean, what's the point?" Shinji asked as he looked at her, "all our teacher talks about is stuff from his personal life. I don't learn anything there, do you? So I'm not going to waste my time." He grabbed more of his breakfast, "I don't see why you do, either."  
我是说，有什么意义呢？" 真嗣看着她问道，"我们老师整天谈的都是他个人生活的事。我在那里学不到任何东西，你呢？所以我不想浪费时间。" 他抓起更多的早餐，"我也不明白你为什么还要去。

Asuka stopped to stare at him and at the the very valid point he just made. "Well. Then what are you going to do? How are you going to explain this to Misato?"  
明日香停下来看着他，他刚才提出的观点确实很有道理。"那么，你打算怎么办？你要怎么向美里解释这件事？

_Borrow her strength. Attack a mutual enemy.  
借用她的力量。攻击共同的敌人。_

"Misato doesn't care." Shinji replied. "When's the last time she got on our case about grades or attendance?"  
“美里根本不在乎。”真嗣回答道，“她上次过问我们的成绩或出勤是什么时候了？”

Asuka's look was one of angry confusion now. Her disgust of Shinji was still there, but she was finding his defiant attitude a little more in line with her own thinking this morning.  
明日香的表情现在带着愤怒的困惑。她对真嗣的厌恶依旧，但今天早上，她发现他那反抗的态度与自己的想法更加契合了。

"What happened?" She asked.  
"发生了什么？" 她问道。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

Asuka leaned forward, "Yesterday you were your meek stupid idiot self, now you have a backbone. What changed?"  
明日香向前倾身，"昨天你还一副懦弱愚蠢的样子，今天却有了骨气。什么让你改变了？"

"I don't know." Shinji replied as he stared at the table, "Maybe I'm just tired of it all, you know? Tired of seeing things come apart around us and being powerless to stop it."  
"我不知道。" 真嗣回答道，目光盯着桌子，"也许我只是厌倦了这一切，你知道吗？厌倦了看着周围的事物分崩离析，而我们却无能为力。"

Shinji didn't look up, but if he had he would have seen the bolt of astonishment across Asuka's face. He spoke her feelings back at her.  
真嗣没有抬头，但如果他抬头的话，他会看到明日香脸上闪过的震惊。他道出了她的心声。

Shinji uttered, "Anyway, there's your breakfast. Eat up before it gets cold."  
真嗣说道，"总之，这是你的早餐。趁热吃吧。"

Asuka, still looking at him, took her seat and ate almost cautiously. She glanced at Shinji occasionally as if he might sprout a third eye.  
明日香依旧盯着他，小心翼翼地坐下用餐。她不时瞥向真嗣，仿佛他随时会长出第三只眼睛似的。

They ate in silence across from one another. Shinji finished his meal first and stood up from the table to take his dishes to the sink. Asuka watched his back for a moment in consideration.  
两人面对面默默地吃着饭。真嗣先吃完，从餐桌旁站起身，将餐具拿到水槽边。明日香若有所思地注视着他的背影。

Once he was done washing up he wordlessly left the kitchen for the living room and turned on the TV. He idly flipped channels, until Asuka entered the room as well and landed her bag noisily on the table. Shinji glanced at her as she settled in the other fold chair and said, "I'm not going to school either."  
"洗完餐具后，他一言不发地离开厨房，走进客厅并打开了电视。他漫不经心地切换着频道，直到明日香也进入房间，砰的一声将书包扔在桌上。真嗣瞥了她一眼，见她坐进另一张折叠椅后说道：“我也不去学校了。””

_The teacher's hand touches the dog's fur gently, the wounded stray wails, barking, but doesn't snap.  
老师的手轻轻触碰着狗的毛发，受伤的流浪狗哀嚎着，吠叫着，却没有咬人。_

The two watch a game show. At its end, Asuka grunted, "These Japanese game shows are bizarre."  
两人观看了一档游戏节目。节目结束时，明日香嘟囔道：“这些日本游戏节目真是奇怪。”

"They are." He agreed, "I don't get them either." Glancing at her, he asked, "What's the TV in Germany like?"  
“确实。”他同意道，“我也不太懂。”他瞥了她一眼，问道：“德国的电视节目是怎样的？”

Asuka thought about it before saying, "The same. Stupid game shows, stupid news. Stupid soaps."  
明日香想了想才说：“都一样。无聊的游戏节目，无聊的新闻，无聊的肥皂剧。”

"Nothing you like?" “没有你喜欢的吗？”

"No. It's just a waste of time."  
“没有。那只是浪费时间。”

"Yeah." Shinji replied, though he raised the remote to go looking for another channel.  
"嗯。" 真嗣回答道，同时举起遥控器开始寻找另一个频道。

Asuka thought for a moment then stood suddenly. "I'm going to change. I'm getting out of this ridiculous uniform."  
明日香想了一会儿，突然站起来说："我要去换衣服。我要脱掉这身可笑的制服。"

Her shoes clapped down the hall to her bedroom. Shinji sighed and leaned back in the chair. He glanced at his hand, wondering what had sustained his temper.  
她的鞋子在走廊上啪嗒啪嗒地响着，朝卧室走去。真嗣叹了口气，向后靠在椅子上。他瞥了一眼自己的手，纳闷是什么让他保持了冷静。

_You decided to drop the meek pretense and offer an honest take. She appreciates authenticity.  
你决定放下温顺的伪装，坦诚地表达自己的看法。她欣赏真实。_

Shinji wondered how long he could keep this up. His anger was making things easier. "A common enemy…." He mused on an earlier thought, closing his fist.  
真嗣不知道自己能坚持多久。愤怒让事情变得简单。“共同的敌人……”他回味着之前的想法，握紧了拳头。

"What did you say?" Asuka demanded as she came back into the room. Shinji did a double take- although she was in a light pink tank top with thin straps, she was also wearing the blue skirt from yesterday.  
“你说什么？”明日香回到房间时质问道。真嗣不禁多看了两眼——尽管她穿着一件浅粉色细带背心，但她还穿着昨天的蓝色裙子。

"U-uh…" "呃…"

_Be complete. 要完整。_

"I-i said… a common enemy." Shinji completed. "I was thinking aloud."  
"我-我说了…一个共同的敌人。" 真嗣补充道，"我只是在自言自语。"

"What is that supposed to mean?" Her hands were on her hips.  
"这是什么意思？" 她双手叉腰。

Shinji, put into this position, didn't know what to say at first.  
真嗣处于这种境地，一开始不知道该说什么。

_Define sympathies. What unites you?  
定义同情。你们之间有什么共同点？_

"I was thinking of… our parents." Shinji replied.  
"我在想……我们的父母。" 真嗣回答道。

_You performed for your father too.  
你也为你父亲表演过。_

He went on, "What you said about your mom reminded me about mine. That… that day, when I met with my father over my mother's grave. That… that was for show, too. I don't really have any connection with him now, not anymore."  
他继续说道："你提到你妈妈的事让我想起了我妈妈。那天，我在母亲的墓前与父亲见面。那……那也是做给别人看的。我现在和他真的没有什么联系了，不再有了。"

Asuka glanced away for a quick thought, before she turned back to him and decided to try again. "I know you don't talk to your dad, but you never said why."  
明日香迅速瞥开视线思考了一下，然后转回来看着他，决定再试一次。“我知道你不和你爸爸说话，但你从没说过为什么。”

"I didn't?" “我没说过吗？”

"No."

Shinji looked into space. "He abandoned me with my sensei when I was four. After my mom died." His head declined a little, "I still don't know why. I've always hated him for it."  
真嗣望向虚空。“我四岁时，他把我丢给了我的导师，就在我妈妈去世后。”他的头微微低垂，“我至今不明白为什么。我一直因此恨他。”

Asuka was staring at him. He looked back. "What?"  
明日香正盯着他。他回望过去。“怎么了？”

Asuka said nothing. She moved off to the kitchen then and came back with two glasses of water. She placed one by his side of the table and the other next to her as she sat down.  
明日香没有说话。她起身走向厨房，然后拿着两杯水回来。她将一杯放在他那边的桌子上，另一杯放在自己坐下时旁边。

His eyes went to the glass, then her.  
他的目光先是落在玻璃杯上，然后转向她。

_She's signaling. This is a reconciliation gesture.  
她在示意。这是一个和解的姿态。_

Shinji was thirsty. 真嗣感到口渴。

"...You don't need a mom and dad." Asuka said, "it's possible. I don't need mine." She lowered her head. "I live for myself, and myself only."  
"...你不需要父母。"明日香说，"这是可能的。我不需要我的父母。"她低下头。"我只为自己而活，仅此而已。"

Shinji blinked at her determination behind her words. He considered them, and lowered his own head in sadness. "I just wish it didn't have to be this way."  
真嗣对她话语中的决心眨了眨眼。他思索着，然后悲伤地低下头。“我只是希望不必如此。”

Asuka said nothing. The two sat and watched the next Tv program, but it failed to catch their attention.  
明日香没有说话。两人坐着观看下一个电视节目，但它未能吸引他们的注意力。

_Take the initiative. 采取主动。_

Shinji blinked, looking away from the TV screen and glancing at Asuka. She noticed. "What?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，从电视屏幕上移开视线，瞥向明日香。她注意到了。“怎么了？”

An timid conversation starter question floated to mind, but he found riding a rail of brutal honesty felt better. Shinji shook his head. "This is boring."  
一个胆怯的搭话问题浮现在脑海，但他发现沿着一条残酷的诚实轨道行驶感觉更好。真嗣摇了摇头。“这很无聊。”

Asuka stared at the screen. "Yeah."  
明日香盯着屏幕。“是啊。”

Shinji wanted to talk. 真嗣想要谈谈。

_Say so. 说吧。_

"Do you… want to talk?" Shinji asked her.  
“你…想要谈谈吗？”真嗣问她。

"Talk." "说话。"

"Yeah." Shinji said, "I want to talk with you."  
"嗯。" 真嗣说道，"我想和你谈谈。"

Asuka leaned back in her chair, "What, Are you waiting for my permission or something?"  
明日香靠在椅背上，"怎么，你是在等我允许还是怎样？"

"I don't want to talk if it's not something you want to do."  
"如果这不是你想做的事，我就不想谈。"

"Whatever. Fine." Asuka dismissed with a wave, "what do you want to talk about?"  
"随便你。好吧。" 明日香摆了摆手，"你想谈什么？"

Shinji tried to think of something.  
真嗣试图想出点什么。

_Mama…_

"No, not that." He muttered.  
"不，不是那个。" 他低声说道。

"What?" Asuka asked. "什么？" 明日香问道。

Shinji shook his head. "Sorry, just thinking." He grabbed the glass of water again and sipped. Then, "You said you don't need your mom and dad. What does that mean? Do… Do you hate your dad, too?"  
真嗣摇了摇头。“抱歉，只是想事情。”他再次拿起那杯水，抿了一口。然后问道：“你说过你不需要你妈妈和爸爸。那是什么意思？你…你也讨厌你爸爸吗？”

Asuka drew the glass up to her face. "What's it to you?"  
明日香将杯子举到脸前。“这跟你有什么关系？”

"I was just curious, sorry." Shinji said, "it sounded like I wasn't the only one who hated his father."  
“我只是有点好奇，对不起。”真嗣说，“听起来好像我不是唯一一个讨厌自己父亲的人。”

Asuka stared into space for a moment to consider answering. Finally, she said with a tinge of flippancy, "No. I don't hate him."  
明日香凝视着虚空，片刻后才考虑是否回答。最终，她带着一丝轻率说道：“不，我不恨他。”

Shinji nodded once without looking at her. "I grew up with my Sensei, but we were never close. What's it like to have parents?"  
真嗣点了点头，却没有看她。“我是和我的师父一起长大的，但我们从不亲近。有父母是什么感觉？”

"I dunno, like normal, I guess. Papa went to work and Mama was around to take care of the house, though she worked evenings after I got home from school."  
"我不知道，就像平常那样吧。爸爸去上班，妈妈在家照顾家务，不过她会在我放学回家后去上晚班。”

Shinji stared, caught up on Asuka's use of 'normal'. "I didn't have anything like that. It was just… just my Sensei. In hindsight he trusted me with a lot… but… I had to learn early on to do a lot of things for myself."  
真嗣愣住了，被明日香口中的'正常'二字所困扰。'我没有那样的经历。只是……只是我的老师。回想起来，他很信任我……但是……我不得不早早学会自己处理很多事情。'

"Oh? Is that why you can cook?"  
哦？这就是你会做饭的原因吗？

"That's part of it." Shinji replied, "There was nobody else living in the house, so I ended up doing a lot of housework. Actually…" Shinji said, "Before Misato insisted that I live with her, I expected I was going to live on the base by myself. I was prepared to."  
这是其中一部分。" 真嗣回答道，"家里没有其他人，所以我不得不承担很多家务。其实……" 真嗣继续说，"在美里坚持要我与她同住之前，我以为我会独自住在基地里。我已经做好了准备。

Asuka sipped her glass. "I didn't know Misato made you move in. I guess I should have assumed, given the rest of your personality."  
明日香抿了一口酒。“我之前不知道是美里让你搬进来的。考虑到你其他的性格特点，我早该猜到的。”

Shinji shrugged. "I think in the end it was probably better this way. This way I have someone to talk to." Shinji looked into his glass, "Someone to say, welcome home. At the end of the day."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我想最终这样可能更好。这样我就有个人可以说说话了。”真嗣凝视着杯中物，“有个人在一天结束时对我说，欢迎回家。”

Asuka grunted behind her glass. "You roomed in with Misato just to have someone to welcome you home? That's a pathetic reason, I just figured you roomed in with Misato because you think she's hot."  
"明日香在杯后哼了一声。“你和美里同住就是为了有人欢迎你回家？这理由真够可怜的，我还以为你是因为觉得她性感才搬进去的。”

Shinji's eyebrows canted up. "Even if she is, I don't like being a bother to other people. I'm not worth it."  
真嗣的眉毛挑了起来。“即便她是，我也不想给别人添麻烦。我不值得。”

Asuka grunted and slammed her cup on the table. "There you go again with your self depreciative crap. It's so tiresome."  
明日香哼了一声，砰地把杯子砸在桌上。“你又来了，总是自我贬低，真是烦死了。”

Shinji had an apology on his lips but-  
真嗣本想道歉，但——

_What would she have you do? What does the you in Asuka' s heart look like?  
她希望你做什么？在明日香心中的你是什么样子？_

Swallowing, he asked instead, "When I offend you, S-should I not apologize?"  
他咽了咽口水，转而问道：“当我冒犯了你，我是不是不应该道歉？”

Asuka pointed at him. "If your apologies don't mean a damn, then I don't want them." She slapped her hand on the table, "You apologize so much the gesture doesn't have meaning anymore. At least TELL me what you apologize for when you do, it shows me you're paying attention."  
明日香指着他，“如果你的道歉毫无意义，那我宁可不要。”她猛地拍了一下桌子，“你道歉得太频繁，以至于这个动作已经失去了意义。至少在道歉时告诉我你为何道歉，这表明你在关注我的感受。”

"Sorry…" Shinji said in reflex. Under Asuka's glowering he swallowed again and amended, "f-for not being thorough when I apologize…" he sighed as Asuka's words sunk in. "You're right, I do say it out of habit a lot. I'm… I'm always apologizing. I… I always have."  
"对不起…" 真嗣下意识地说道。在明日香的怒视下，他再次吞咽了一下，修正道："对…对不起，我道歉时总是不够彻底…" 他叹了口气，明日香的话深入他心。"你说得对，我确实经常习惯性地说对不起。我…我总是在道歉。我…我一直都是这样。"

"And you use it to dodge responsibility." Asuka said, "Seriously, if you truly have regrets, own up to what you've done and resolve to make it better. That way it shows to the offended party that your actions are sincere!"  
"而你用它来逃避责任。" 明日香说，"说真的，如果你真的感到后悔，就应该承认你所做的事，并决心去改正它。这样才表明你对受伤害的一方是真诚的！"

Shinji closed his eyes. "I hate hurting people, just as I hate being hurt. But I can't help it sometimes. Saying I'm sorry is the least I could do."  
真嗣闭上眼睛。"我讨厌伤害别人，就像我讨厌被伤害一样。但有时候我控制不住。说对不起是我能做的最起码的事。"

"But you CAN choose how you make it up to people when you do mess up, and if they matter to you, you try that much harder." She grabbed her glass again. "If they're worth your time, they'll appreciate the gesture a hell of a lot more than just saying 'sorry' like a pathetic idiot."  
"但你可以选择在犯错后如何弥补，如果他们对你很重要，你会更加努力。" 她再次拿起杯子。"如果他们值得你花时间，他们会比一个可怜的傻瓜只说'对不起'更感激你的举动。"

"I see." Shinji responded. He smiled a little in spite of himself. "Thank you, Asuka. I'll try to be more mindful in the future."  
"我明白了。" 真嗣回应道。尽管如此，他还是不由自主地微笑了。"谢谢你，明日香。我以后会更加注意的。"

She stared at him for a moment, thinking. "Hmf." She grunted, "You're welcome."  
她盯着他看了一会儿，思考着。"哼。" 她哼了一声，"不客气。"

Shinji smiled a little, grateful to have another nicer exchange with Asuka for once.  
真嗣微微一笑，庆幸这次能和明日香有一次更愉快的交流。

The girl sipped her glass, finishing it off. She put it on the table and decided to try once more. "I lied earlier. I hate my father."  
女孩抿了一口酒，一饮而尽。她将杯子放在桌上，决定再试一次。“我之前撒谎了。我讨厌我的父亲。”

Shinji looked over at her with an uncharacteristically serious look. "What did he do?"  
"真嗣转头看向她，脸上带着不同寻常的严肃。“他做了什么？””

"I don't want to talk about that." She said, "I just wanted to tell you that you aren't alone. I can't stand my father either. My stepmother is a go between because, otherwise, I wouldn't have any family connection."  
"我不想谈那个。" 她说，"我只是想告诉你，你并不孤单。我也受不了我父亲。我的继母只是个中间人，否则我就没有任何家庭联系了。"

"I… I see. This is what you meant by being a formality."  
"我…我明白了。这就是你所说的形式上的关系。"

"Yes." She said. Wincing as she stared into space, she clenched her fist as she went deeper. "The only one I know who ever loved me was mama. And she's gone now."  
"是的。" 她说。她凝视着虚空，皱着眉头，握紧拳头，越陷越深。"我认识的唯一一个爱过我的人是我妈妈。而现在她已经走了。"

_Mama…_ Shinji thought. The same one she called for in her sleep.  
妈妈… 真嗣心想。那个她在睡梦中呼唤的人。

_Don't push. Let her guide you if she's ready.  
别催促。如果她准备好了，让她引导你。_

Shinji stared at the floor, uncertain what to say at first.  
真嗣盯着地板，一时不知该说什么好。

_She's the same as you.  
她和你是同一种人。_

"I lost my mom when I was four." Shinji said, putting, it out there. He looked at her. "And I hate my father."  
“我四岁时失去了母亲。”真嗣说道，直截了当。他看着她。“而且我恨我的父亲。”

Asuka stared at him. Then she caught his meaning and started getting angry, "wh-what, you think you can sympathize with me? You have no idea what I'm going through!"  
明日香盯着他。随后她领会了他的意思，开始生气起来，“什——什么，你以为你能同情我？你根本不知道我经历了什么！”

Shinji blinked. This had been going so well… "B-but-!"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。事情本来进展得很顺利……“但-但是-！”

Asuka stood up. "We are not the same! Don't compare me to you… you… you amatuer! Idiot! Stupid… stupid…!"  
明日香站了起来。“我们不一样！别拿我和你……你这个……业余的家伙！白痴！愚蠢……愚蠢……！”

_Talk to her! 去跟她谈谈！_

"Then Tell Me!" Shinji blasted back, turning to face her. "Talk to me! I am not your enemy! I want to get to know you but I don't know anything unless you _talk_ to me!"  
"那么告诉我！" 真嗣反驳道，转身面对她。"跟我说话！我不是你的敌人！我想了解你，但如果你不跟我说话，我什么都不知道！"

"Bullshit!" She cried back, "You had your chances to listen and you blew them! You're so stupid and dense and oblivious-! Y-you'll never know a hint even if it barged in and demanded your attention! I don't want your help! I don't want anyone's help! Stay away from me!"  
"胡说八道！" 她哭喊着回应，"你有很多机会听我说话，但你都错过了！你太愚蠢、迟钝、无知了！就算线索直接冲进来要求你的注意，你也永远不会察觉！我不需要你的帮助！我不需要任何人的帮助！离我远点！"

_The dog yelps as sensei's hands stroke the coarse fur.  
随着老师的手抚摸粗糙的毛发，狗儿发出一声尖叫。_

Shinji blinked and next he knew she was gone. He heard the door close. "She…she ran away…"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，下一刻她就不见了。他听到门关上的声音。“她……她逃走了……”

_Like you do. 就像你一样。_

Shinji stood took some steps towards the hall, trying to think of what to do. What to say. Her statement about barging in. Was that a hint? But... "She told me to stay away. So… I should."  
真嗣站起来，朝大厅走了几步，试图思考该做什么，该说什么。她关于闯入的言论，那是个暗示吗？但是...“她让我离远点。所以……我应该这么做。”

_The Walls of Jericho. 耶利哥之墙。_

Shinji balled his fists and decided to finally look up what that term meant. His class laptop was still in the living room, so he opened it up and read the description online.  
真嗣握紧拳头，决定终于要查清楚那个词的意思。他的班级笔记本电脑还在客厅里，于是他打开电脑，在网上阅读了描述。

'Walls of Jericho usually refers to the destruction of the walls of Jericho in the biblical story of the Battle of Jericho. On the seventh day the Israelites destroyed the wall by sounding a trumpet and letting out a great shout.'  
‘耶利哥之墙’通常指的是圣经中耶利哥之战故事里耶利哥城墙的毁灭。在第七天，以色列人通过吹响号角并发出巨大的呐喊声摧毁了城墙。

He stopped to recall that conversation long ago, staring across the room at Misato's door where it happened. She must have wanted him to come in, then.  
他停下脚步，回忆起很久以前的那个对话，目光穿过房间，落在发生这一切的美里房间的门上。她当时一定是希望他进去的。

_She needed your help. 她需要你的帮助。_

Shinji wasn't sure about the assumption he was forming now. The more he thought of it, the more it felt out of his comfort zone. He walked down the hall and stopped in front of her door. The Wall of Jericho.  
真嗣对自己此刻形成的想法并不确定。他越是思考，越觉得这超出了他的舒适区。他沿着走廊走去，在她的门前停下。那是耶利哥之墙。

Wants _and_ Needs _are different things._  
欲望与需求是两码事。

He raised his fist to knock on her door.  
他举起拳头，准备敲她的门。

It wavered, then lowered. He grunted and walked away. "This is stupid." He murmured, "She doesn't want anything to do with me." As he walked away he muttered to himself about Jericho, "I'm just overthinking it. A wall is a stupid wall."  
拳头犹豫了一下，又放了下来。他哼了一声，转身离开。“这太蠢了。”他低声自语，“她根本不想和我有任何瓜葛。”走远时，他喃喃自语着关于耶利哥的事，“我只是想多了。一堵墙就是一堵愚蠢的墙。”

_You're running away. 你在逃避。_

Housework was something he could catch up on. To burn away his frustration at this senseless impulse, he threw himself into cleaning the kitchen.  
家务活他可以补上。为了发泄这种无意义的冲动带来的挫败感，他一头扎进厨房开始打扫。

He scrubbed for an hour and a half-  
他擦洗了一个半小时——

_You're running away- 你这是在逃避——_

-Grinding harder with the elbow grease as if to mash this foolish impulse out of his head. Help Asuka? From what? Why was it his place to-  
——用力地用肘部磨蹭，仿佛要将这愚蠢的冲动从脑海中挤出去。帮助明日香？从何谈起？为什么这成了他的责任——

_Hey Shinji, want to kiss?  
嘿，真嗣，想接吻吗？_

Shinji's drive popped and his anger started to deflate. He had been physically close to her then- she touched him! Intimately! Or it would have been intimate, if she wasn't just… "I wish she wasn't just bored, then. I wish that had meant something." He said sadly.  
真嗣的怒气突然泄了气，他的怒火开始消退。那时他离她很近——她碰了他！亲密地！如果不是她只是……“我希望她不是因为无聊，那样的话。我希望那意味着什么。”他悲伤地说道。

He turned to grab the bucket and empty the-  
他转身去抓水桶，准备倒掉——

Something was wrong in his vision and he looked up.  
他的视线中有些不对劲，于是他抬头看去。

Asuka was standing halfway between the hall and the bathroom. She was still dressed in her clothes from earlier. They stared at one another, Shinji's eyes widening with surprise. _She heard me!_  
明日香站在大厅与浴室之间的半道上，仍穿着早先的衣服。他们四目相对，真嗣的眼睛因惊讶而睁大。她听见我了！

After that second of shock Asuka fled into the bathroom and rushed the curtain closed. Shinji heard the door to the toilet slam soon after that.  
经过那一瞬间的震惊后，明日香逃进了浴室，急忙拉上了帘子。随后不久，真嗣听到了厕所门砰的一声关上。

Shinji remained paused in the room, trying to process what had just happened. Asuka's expression held surprise… Why would it be surprise?  
真嗣在房间里愣住了，试图理解刚刚发生的事情。明日香的表情中带着惊讶……为什么会感到惊讶呢？

_Her assumptions about the kiss were challenged.  
她对那个吻的假设受到了挑战。_

He considered that thought and looked at the door to the bathroom. What if his assumptions about the kiss were wrong, too? What if it wasn't just boredom? _Then, what did she want out of kissing me? I wish things could be more clear. Unless…_  
他思考着这个念头，望向浴室的门。如果他对那个吻的假设也错了呢？如果不仅仅是因为无聊呢？那么，她吻我到底想要得到什么？真希望事情能更清楚一些。除非……

His head dipped. Does she like me, too? _But then, why is she so mean the rest of the time?_  
他的头低了下来。难道她也喜欢我吗？但为什么其他时候她又那么刻薄呢？

_The dog brays, frightened and hurt. His sensei's hands kept touching the dog, gentle and firm. The dog calms down, whimpers.  
那只狗惊恐而受伤地哀嚎着。他的师父双手不停地抚摸着狗，温柔而坚定。狗渐渐平静下来，发出低低的呜咽声。_

He turned back to chores, but with less blind effort and with more contemplation. He still didn't know what, in this metaphor, was hurting her.  
他转身继续做家务，但不再盲目用力，而是多了几分沉思。他仍然不明白，在这个比喻中，是什么在伤害她。

_What has she won recently?  
她最近赢得了什么？_

Shinji stopped to think about that. Synch ratios? No. Combat sorties? No. School popularity? Yes? No, she still complained about the advances of boys that didn't interest her.  
真嗣停下来思考了一下。同步率？不是。战斗出击？也不是。学校人气？是吗？不，她还是抱怨那些对她不感兴趣的男生的追求。

_She is constantly losing.  
她总是输。_

He stopped his sweeping then to look at the bathroom door where Asuka was still hiding. Things were starting to make sense now.  
他停下扫地的动作，看向浴室门，明日香还在那里躲着。现在事情开始变得明朗了。

_She's hostile because she's losing. And the time she kissed you…  
她之所以充满敌意，是因为她正在输。还有她吻你的那次……_

Shinji lifted his head a degree. He got it now. That kiss must have meant more, and she lost that, too. That's another reason why she was angry. But… if it meant more, what did she want out of it? Just flirting?  
真嗣微微抬起头。他现在明白了。那个吻一定意味着更多，而她也失去了那一切。这也是她为何愤怒的另一个原因。但是……如果那意味着更多，她从中想要得到什么呢？仅仅是调情吗？

He glanced up from sweeping the entry hall when Asuka emerged from the bathroom. She had scanned the kitchen, then the living room, as she slowly headed back to her room. She stopped just before turning down the hall, and turned around. Their eyes locked.  
当明日香从浴室出来时，他正从门厅扫视着。她先是扫视了厨房，然后是客厅，缓缓地朝自己的房间走去。就在即将拐进走廊之前，她停下了脚步，转过身来。他们的目光交汇了。

He straightened as he held the broom. Both of them held their gaze.  
他挺直身子握着扫帚。两人都保持着目光的交流。

_Feed her lunch! 给她喂午饭！_

"Lunch will be soon," he said, breaking the silence, "It's just us. would… Would you like me to make something specific?"  
“午饭很快就好，”他打破沉默说道，“就我们俩。你……你想吃点什么特别的吗？”

She stared at him without speaking for a moment, then turned her head to look down the hall. "I'll think about it." She answered and disappeared from sight.  
她盯着他看了一会儿，没有说话，然后转头望向走廊。“我会考虑的。”她回答后便消失在视线中。

Shinji gripped the broom.  
真嗣紧握着扫帚。

_That isn't a no. 那并不是拒绝。_

Shinji looked at the broom. "Then what is it, then?" He uttered to the impulse in his mind.  
真嗣看着扫帚。“那它是什么，那么？”他对着脑海中的冲动说道。

_The wounds are deep. And there's a ways to go.  
伤口很深。还有很长的路要走。_

_His sensei's hand remains, in spite of the dogs barking.  
尽管狗在吠叫，他师父的手依旧存在。_

_Until it calms down. 直到它平静下来。_

---

"Ramen." She declared, just standing in the kitchen now. "I want homemade Ramen!"  
“拉面。”她宣布道，现在就站在厨房里。“我要吃自制的拉面！”

Shinji had been starting to think about lunch and had been debating how to approach Asuka to follow up on his offer. It was a relief that she came to him.  
真嗣一直在考虑午餐的事，并纠结于如何向明日香跟进他的提议。她主动来找他，真是松了一口气。

"Ok, sure!" He replied pleasantly. "Coming up!"  
"好的，当然！" 他愉快地回答。"马上就来！"

He had been afraid that she would have requested something extraordinary, and didn't want to have to go back on his offer for lack of ingredients. He landed the pot on the stove, retrieved a cutting mat, and started to grab the vegetables. He had set aside some of these for dinner, but right now he couldn't say no to Asuka. _Because she's hurting._  
他曾担心她会要求一些特别的东西，不想因为缺少食材而收回自己的提议。他把锅放在炉子上，拿出切菜板，开始抓取蔬菜。他本打算留一些晚上吃，但现在他无法拒绝明日香。因为她正受伤。

Before he started chopping, he cast a glance over his shoulder. Asuka was still standing there, staring at him with her fists balled at her sides. She hadn't moved. Her expression was still hostile, making his innards start to seize in fear. She was still mad?  
开始切菜前，他回头瞥了一眼。明日香还站在那里，双手握拳站在两侧，一动不动。她的表情依旧充满敌意，让他内心开始感到恐惧。她还在生气吗？

_Take things slow. You aren't the only one confused about how they feel.  
慢慢来。你不是唯一一个对感情感到困惑的人。_

Hesitating a little, Shinji asked, "i-is there something else you would like me to make?"  
犹豫了一下，真嗣问道：“还、还有其他什么你想让我做的吗？”

She seemed to snap out of it, coming back to herself. "No." She said. She shook her head and spun before striding into the living room. As Shinji turned back to chopping the vegetables, he heard the TV come back on.  
她似乎回过神来，恢复了自我。“没有。”她说道，摇了摇头，转身大步走进客厅。当真嗣转回去继续切蔬菜时，他听到电视又打开了。

Shinji spent the time preparing lunch wondering how to approach her again. He reviewed what he knew; She was hurt because she kept losing. She had expected more out of the kiss and lost that. If he was direct with her, as he was when he tried to illustrate how they were the same, she rebuffed his advances.  
真嗣在准备午餐的时候，一直在思考如何再次接近她。他回顾了自己所了解的情况：她因为一直输而受伤。她对那个吻抱有更多期待，却失去了。如果他直接向她表达，就像他试图说明他们是一样的那样，她会拒绝他的接近。

A puzzle. Was it all even worth it?  
一个谜。这一切真的值得吗？

He cast his gaze into the living room where he could see the back of her head. Pity hit him, knowing now how she was losing things. But he also remembered how he saw her in the days before the kiss- admiring her passion and drive and drawing strength from her energy.  
他将目光投向客厅，能看到她的后脑勺。他感到同情，现在知道她正在失去东西。但他也记得在那个吻之前的日子里，他如何看到她的——欣赏她的热情和动力，并从她的活力中汲取力量。

But bitterness had replaced gusto. Shrilling had replaced bravado. He could see that now, as he thought about it. _I have to help her! I want to see her be those things again!_  
但苦涩已取代了热情，尖锐已取代了勇气。他现在想起来，看得一清二楚。我必须帮助她！我想再次看到她那样！

The ramen bowls were done. Chicken with soft boiled eggs. Shinji even grabbed the fork with a pair of chopsticks. He brought the bowl to her at the table.  
拉面做好了。鸡肉配溏心蛋。真嗣甚至用筷子夹着叉子。他把碗端到她面前的桌上。

"Thanks." She said without looking at him.  
“谢谢。”她没有看他，只是说道。

Shinji stepped away to the kitchen at first, partly recoiling from any anticipated blowback. When nothing came he stopped at the threshold back into the living room. "Asuka."  
真嗣一开始退到厨房，部分是出于对可能的反击的退缩。当什么也没发生时，他在回到客厅的门槛处停了下来。“明日香。”

The tone made her turn her head halfway to him. "What is it?"  
这语气让她半转过头来看向他。“什么事？”

"I… I'm here, if you want to talk again."  
“我……如果你想再谈谈，我在这里。”

She turned back to the TV, not saying anything, and Shinji waited a moment. When she said nothing he went back into the kitchen, missing her angry huff at him and at herself.  
她转回电视前，一言不发，而真嗣等了一会儿。当她没有说话时，他回到了厨房，错过了她对他和自己愤怒的哼声。

But her eyes widened and her head turned a degree when she heard him come back with his own ramen, and land at the table opposite of her to watch TV.  
但当她听到他带着自己的拉面回来，并在她对面的桌子上坐下看电视时，她的眼睛睁大了，头也微微转了一下。

She looked back and forth between the TV and Shinji before barking at him, "What are you doing there!?"  
她来回看着电视和真嗣，然后冲他吼道：“你在那儿干什么！？”

Shinji looked at her, startled. "I'm… having lunch." He shifted a little. "I can leave, if you want."  
真嗣惊讶地看着她。“我…正在吃午饭。”他稍微挪动了一下。“如果你愿意，我可以离开。”

"Yes! No! I don't know!" She grunted.  
“是！不！我不知道！”她嘟囔道。

Shinji considered his position. _I don't want to bother her… but I want to help her._  
真嗣考虑着自己的立场。我不想打扰她…但我又想帮助她。

_Tell her you want to stay, because it's the truth. Be honest.  
告诉她你想留下，因为这是事实。要诚实。_

"I want to stay." Shinji told her.  
“我想留下。”真嗣告诉她。

"Then stay." She replied with her eyes fixed on the screen.  
“那就留下吧。”她回答道，目光紧盯着屏幕。

Shinji said nothing more and started eating. Asuka, hearing the clatter of Shinji's chopsticks, remembered her bowl and reached for it. She noticed the fork, and her eyes darted to Shinji. He was busy slurping noodles. She took the fork and attacked her raman with gusto, she was hungry.  
真嗣没有再说什么，开始吃起饭来。听到真嗣筷子的声响，明日香想起了自己的碗，伸手去拿。她注意到了叉子，目光迅速转向真嗣。他正忙着吸溜面条。她拿起叉子，大口大口地吃起了拉面，她饿了。

It tasted fantastic. 味道棒极了。

---

Neither of them spoke while they watched the movie. When it ended though, Shinji asked her, "Can I take your bowl?"  
两人在看电影时都没有说话。但电影结束后，真嗣问她：“我可以拿你的碗吗？”

She passed it over wordlessly. Collecting it, Shinji ventured, "it's been nice to have the place to ourselves, hasn't it?"  
她默默地递了过去。接过后，真嗣试探着说：“能独享这个地方，感觉挺好的，不是吗？”

That turned Asuka's head, but she turned it away again. "Really? You didn't seem as thrilled about it the last time."  
这话让明日香转过头来，但随即又转了回去。“是吗？上次你看起来可没这么兴奋。”

Shinji set the bowls in the sink.  
真嗣将碗碟放在水槽里。

_The last time was the night of the kiss.  
上次是在那个亲吻的夜晚。_

"T-thats because… um…" Shinji said, hand on the back if his head as he walked back to the living room. "I… I didn't know what… we could do."  
"那是因为……呃……" 真嗣说着，手放在后脑勺上，一边走回客厅。"我……我不知道我们能做什么。"

Shinji blushed as he realized he over extended. He swallowed nervously as he looked at her.  
意识到自己过于冒进，真嗣脸红了。他紧张地咽了咽口水，看着她。

Asuka stood and approached him. She crossed her arms. "Do you know what you're saying?"  
明日香站起身，向他走去。她交叉双臂，问道：“你知道自己在说什么吗？”

Shinji swallowed as he faced her from beside the table. "I… I think I do." His hands clenched as he committed.  
真嗣站在桌子旁面对着她，咽了口唾沫。“我……我想我知道。”他握紧双手，下定了决心。

Asuka stared at him. Then, "No, you don't."  
明日香盯着他看了一会儿，然后说：“不，你不知道。”

"What?" "什么？"

Her hands went to her hips. "You don't have the savvy to figure your way out of a paper bag, Third. Stop saying nonsense words you don't mean."  
她双手叉腰，说道：“你连从纸袋里钻出来的机灵劲儿都没有，老三。别再说那些言不由衷的废话了。”

"Asuka." He stepped forward.  
“明日香。”他向前迈了一步。

She stepped back, shrugging sarcastically. "After all, if you can't figure out a parade of hints then-"  
她后退一步，带着讽刺地耸了耸肩。“毕竟，如果你连一连串的暗示都看不明白的话——”

"I looked up what the Walls of Jericho meant." Shinji said to her, heart thudding in his ears.  
"我查了一下耶利哥之墙的意思。" 真嗣对她说道，心跳声在耳边砰砰作响。

"Oh? You looked it up, huh?" Her shrug dropped as she flipped her arms back to rest hands on hips. "Did you study up on the right words to say to a girl while you're at it? Couldn't figure it out on your own?"  
"哦？你还查了啊？" 她耸耸肩，双手往后一甩，叉腰站定。"是不是顺便还学了怎么跟女孩子说话？自己琢磨不出来吗？"

_The dog barks. 狗在叫。_

"Asuka." "明日香。"

"What, Third?" "怎么了，第三？"

"Please stop. I know you're hurting." Shinji said, staring level at her surprised face as she slowly gasped. "I figured it out, finally. I want to help you."  
"请停下来。我知道你很痛苦。" 真嗣直视着她惊讶的脸庞，她缓缓地喘息着。"我终于明白了。我想帮助你。"

"Bullshit!" She barked at him, fists thrown out her sides now, "You know nothing!"  
"胡说八道！" 她对他怒吼，双拳紧握在身体两侧，"你一无所知！"

"Piloting means everything to you!"  
"驾驶对你来说就是一切！"

"No shit! I have a nose on my face, too!"  
"废话！我也有鼻子在脸上，看得见！"

"Asuka, I keep telling you, i'm not your enemy!"  
"明日香，我一再告诉你，我不是你的敌人！"

"Liar! You couldn't wait to rub it in my face when you passed up my sync scores! Don't be a fucking hypocrite!"  
"骗子！你超越我的同步率时，迫不及待地就想炫耀一番！别装模作样了！"

Shinji blinked, stepping back. "I… I did do that, but I didn't know it would hurt you! And I don't want to hurt you again!"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，后退一步。“我…我确实那么做了，但我不知道那会伤害到你！我不想再伤害你了！”

"You sure do a good job of it whenever you open your mouth!"  
"你每次一开口，做得还真不错！"

"Asuka what do you want from me? How can I do better?!"  
"明日香，你到底想要我怎样？我怎样才能做得更好？"

"I want you to figure it out without me spelling it out to you!"  
"我希望你自己去领悟，而不是让我一字一句地告诉你！"

"I can't do that unless you give me something to work with! Asuka, I can't read minds!"  
"我做不到啊，除非你给我点线索！明日香，我又不会读心术！"

"Idiot! I've been giving you hints this whole time! It's not my fault you're too dense to see them!"  
"笨蛋！我一直在给你暗示！是你自己太迟钝看不出来，怪我咯！"

"And I was just supposed to just know what the Walls of Jericho were? If you're going to give me hints, you have to meet me halfway so I know what you're saying!"  
"难道我就该知道‘耶利哥之墙’是什么吗？你要是给提示，至少得让我明白你在说什么吧！"

"I can't get any easier than when I tried to kiss you, moron! You're so dense you let the flimsiest excuse stop you from seeing what's in front of your face!"  
"亲你的时候已经够简单了，笨蛋！你迟钝到连最蹩脚的借口都能阻止你看到眼前的真相！"

Asuka stopped as she realized what she had just said, her face turning beat red. Shinji's had as well.  
意识到自己刚刚说了什么，明日香停了下来，脸红得像熟透的苹果。真嗣的脸也红了。

She turned and bolted from the room. "Asuka!" Shinji called to her.  
"她转身冲出了房间。"明日香！"真嗣朝她喊道。

She didn't turn. This time he pursued. "Asuka!"  
她没有回头。这次他追了上去。“明日香！”

The door thunked closed once more. Shinji stepped up to it, face to face with the door plate promising death to anyone who crossed that door without permission.  
门再次砰地关上。真嗣走到门前，面对着门牌，上面写着未经允许穿越此门者将面临死亡。

Shinji huffed and puffed as he tried to think of what to shout at her through the barrier. At least he could continue his pursuit with words.  
真嗣气喘吁吁，试图想出透过障碍向她喊些什么。至少他可以用言语继续他的追求。

_Don't rip back in anger what you have gained. She needs to process now what just happened.  
不要愤怒地撕毁你已获得的一切。她现在需要处理刚刚发生的事情。_

Shinji's fists waved a little at his side with pent up frustration, but not trusting himself to speak he turned and stomped back down the hallway. Again he questioned if it was worth this.  
真嗣紧握的拳头在身侧微微挥动，满是压抑的挫败感，但他不信任自己能开口说话，于是转身重重地沿着走廊走回去。他再次质疑这一切是否值得。

Her smile. 她的微笑。

He sighed out his pent up frustration and turned to look back down the hall. He returned to her door.  
他叹了口气，释放出积压的烦躁，转头望向走廊深处。他回到了她的门前。

"Asuka." He said to the plate. "I… I know you're losing things. Your sync scores, grades… a lot. It didn't occur to me until I thought about it and put the pieces together.  
"“明日香。”他对着门牌说道，“我……我知道你在失去东西。同步率、成绩……很多。直到我仔细思考，把线索拼凑起来，我才意识到这一点。”

"I wanted to tell you though that you didn't… you didn't lose me. I'm always here for you, Asuka, no…no matter what happens. I'm… I'm sorry I didn't see that you wanted something from me sooner." He trailed off.  
“我想告诉你，尽管如此，你没有……你没有失去我。我永远在这里支持你，明日香，无论发生什么。我……我很抱歉，没有早点看出你从我这里需要些什么。”他的声音渐渐低了下去。

Shinji had heard footsteps which stopped as he reached the end of what he said. He could imagine her on the other end of this door, standing and staring into the back of it. At him.  
真嗣听到了脚步声，当他讲完时，脚步声停了下来。他可以想象她在门的另一边，站着凝视着门的背面，对着他。

_Ask her to open the door to talk to you.  
请她开门和你说话。_

"Go away." She said from beyond the door.  
“走开。”她从门那边说道。

Shinji hesitated. He balled his fists again. "Why are you pushing me away? I thought this is what you wanted, when you told me about the walls of Jericho."  
真嗣犹豫了。他再次握紧了拳头。“为什么你要推开我？我以为这是你想要的，当你告诉我关于耶利哥城墙的事时。”

She didn't answer. 她没有回答。

Shinji stared into the sign. Finally, he said, "Asuka, I will not open this door without your permission."  
真嗣凝视着那个标志。最终，他说道：“明日香，没有你的允许，我不会打开这扇门。”

He thought over his words, staring into her eyes through the door between them. "Asuka, I want you to know… I'd trade almost anything to see you go back to the incredible person you were when we met. I… I like that person. Even if I was intimidated all the time, I took comfort in your strength. I wouldn't be as good of a pilot now, if it wasn't for you showing me what that looked like. But… now…"  
他斟酌着言辞，透过他们之间的门凝视着她的眼睛。“明日香，我想让你知道…我愿意用几乎任何东西来换取你回到我们相遇时那个令人惊叹的人。我…我喜欢那个人。即使我总是感到害怕，但你的坚强给了我安慰。如果不是你向我展示了那种样子，我现在不会成为一个这么好的驾驶员。但是…现在…”

Shinji lowered his head. He didn't know if she was listening. Or if she cared. "Now I see you hurt and lashing out, and all I want to do is try to help you. But… things keep clashing. I can't seem to reach you. I… I worry that it's too late."  
真嗣低下头。他不知道她是否在听，或者她是否在乎。“现在我看到你受伤并反击，我只想尽力帮助你。但是…事情总是冲突不断。我似乎无法触及你。我…我担心已经太晚了。”

The silence finally overcame him and his eyes lowered to the ground. He sighed and returned to the kitchen to finish chores.  
沉默最终战胜了他，他的目光垂向地面。他叹了口气，回到厨房继续完成家务。

The voice inside of him was quiet.  
他内心的声音很微弱。

---

_She's gone. 她走了。_

Shinji stopped playing the cello. To pass the time, and with some hope that Asuka could come out to see him, Shinji took up his instrument and started playing it. He lost track of time.  
真嗣停止了拉大提琴。为了打发时间，也抱着一丝明日香能出来见他的希望，真嗣拿起乐器开始演奏。他忘记了时间。

To test his hunch he went to the door. Sure enough, her shoes were gone. She had walked right by him without saying anything or getting his attention.  
为了验证他的猜想，他走向门口。果不其然，她的鞋子不见了。她就这样从他身边走过，没有说一句话，也没有引起他的注意。

It… it was too late. In spite of trying to reach her… turn things around… see her. She still left.  
已经……太迟了。尽管努力想要联系她……扭转局面……见到她。她还是离开了。

He took steps back into the empty apartment from the front door. Pen Pen was the only one left now, and he wasn't much for conversation.  
他从门口退回到空荡荡的公寓里。现在只剩下企鹅了，而它并不是一个擅长交谈的伙伴。

What was Shinji to do now?  
现在，真嗣该怎么办呢？

He stopped in the dining area next to the kitchen table, next to where she had been sitting the night of the Kiss. So many memories about her flowed through his head as he tried to think,of what to do now.  
他在厨房餐桌旁的用餐区停下脚步，那里正是她那晚亲吻他时坐过的地方。关于她的无数回忆涌上心头，他试图思考，现在该做什么。

He thought of her lithe figure when he watched her on the call. He thought of her presence when she dropped, unbidden, next to him on the cot. He thought of her kiss, the one he now wished he could have savored closer.  
他回想起在通话中看到的她那轻盈的身影。他回想起她未经邀请就坐到他床边的情景。他回想起她的吻，那个他现在希望自己能更近一步细细品味的吻。

…he thought of her hand, slipping away from him.  
…他想起了她的手，从他手中滑落。

He wondered, _can I follow her? Should I follow her? Where did she go? Or… or would I just be a nag?_  
他疑惑着，我能跟随她吗？我应该跟随她吗？她去了哪里？还是说…我会不会只是个烦人的跟屁虫？

Shinji started to pack away the cello. Once it was in his room he returned to the living room and ruminated on all that had happened today.  
真嗣开始收拾大提琴。将其放回房间后，他回到客厅，沉思着今天发生的所有事情。

He wanted it to matter. But it seems like nothing had changed for her. He... He had failed.  
他希望这能有所意义。但似乎对她来说，一切如故。他...他失败了。

Dinner. 晚餐。

Yes, he could still make dinner. One more try, maybe. One more try.  
是的，他还能做晚餐。再试一次，或许。再试一次。

---

Shinji Ikari was no gourmet cook. While he lived under Misato's roof he had increased his skill out of necessity of survival, but he wouldn't consider himself restaurant quality. He was only a boy.  
碇真嗣并非美食大厨。在美里家寄宿期间，他出于生存需要提升了自己的烹饪技能，但他并不认为自己能达到餐馆水准。他毕竟还只是个少年。

This time, now, he was determined to increase his ability by an entire degree.  
这一次，此刻，他决心将自己的烹饪能力提升整整一个档次。

For her. 为了她。

With hours to kill he left the apartment and went to Misato's favorite store for imports on a hope. She used this place to buy exotic booze, but Shinji was in luck when they had the ingredients he sought. Knocking out item after item- with only one compromise- he returned to Misato 's apartment with his grocery haul.  
闲来无事，他离开公寓，怀着一线希望前往美里最爱的进口商品店。她常在此购买异国酒水，而这次真嗣运气不错，店里正好有他所需的食材。一件接一件地采购，仅做了一次妥协，他便带着满满的食材回到了美里的公寓。

He didn't care how much he put on Misato's credit card.  
他不在乎在美里的信用卡上花了多少钱。

Next, consulting the laptop, he started the kitchen symphony of orchestrating a full German dinner. The target was Jaeger Schnitzel.  
接下来，他参考笔记本电脑上的资料，开始在厨房里奏响一场德国大餐的交响曲，目标是一道正宗的猎人炸肉排。

He worked at it for two hours. A taste test at the end was satisfying, at least to his tastebuds. Now all he had to do was wait for Asuka to return.  
他为此忙活了两个小时。最后尝了一口，至少对他的味蕾来说还算满意。现在，他只需等待明日香回来。

Anxiety chewed at his nerves as he sat in that chair in the living room. This was his one shot to make a diff-  
他坐在客厅的椅子上，焦虑啃噬着他的神经。这是他唯一的机会，去做出改变——

The door. 门。

Shinji was up like a shot and moving to the table. Mitts in hand he started serving up. He had rehearsed in his head what he wanted to say to her, hoping he could somehow get out some of his profound feelings. Even his shadow was rooting for him.  
真嗣像弹簧一样跳起来，走向桌子。手里拿着餐巾，开始盛菜。他在脑海中反复排练过要对她说的话，希望能表达出自己深沉的情感。甚至连他的影子似乎都在为他加油。

"Oh my God, Shinji!" The wrong voice said, "what is this?"  
“哦，我的天，真嗣！”一个错误的声音说道，“这是什么？”

Shinji felt two sensations at once. The first was the solid-stiff shock of embarrassment freezing him in place as Misato descended over the food. The next was creeping sadness over witnessing Misato steal this gift.  
真嗣同时感受到两种情绪。首先是尴尬的强烈冲击，让他僵在原地，看着美里俯身在食物上。接着是逐渐涌起的悲伤，目睹美里夺走了这份礼物。

Misato continued, "...For Asuka isn't it? You sly devil, I knew you had it in you! I hope it works! Now, tell me what it's made of!"  
碇真嗣继续说道，“...是为了明日香吧？你这狡猾的家伙，我就知道你有这本事！希望它能奏效！现在，告诉我它是由什么制成的！”

Shinji was breathless, but he willed himself to speak and answer Misato's questions. In the middle of that, and amid her praises for upgrading his cooking, he looked up.  
碇真嗣喘不过气来，但他强迫自己说话并回答葛城美里的问题。在这过程中，她对他的厨艺升级赞不绝口，他抬头望去。

Of course Asuka was standing there in the entry hall. Shinji could read across the room that something on her venture had hurt her. Her face had the frozen look of anguished disappointment. And now, this stolen meal was just icing on that cake.  
当然，明日香就站在玄关那里。碇真嗣隔着房间就能看出，她这次外出受到了伤害。她的脸上带着痛苦的失望的凝固表情。而现在，这顿偷来的饭菜不过是雪上加霜。

Misato, oblivious, turned to Asuka. "Asuka! Did you see the food Shinji made? Here, sit down and have a bite, let's all-!"  
明日香，浑然不觉，转向明日香。“明日香！你看到真嗣做的食物了吗？来，坐下尝一口，我们一起——！”

"I'm not hungry!" The redhead blasted and stormed through the room, freezing the others in place out of shock. She vanished after turning again to hide in her room.  
“我不饿！”红发少女怒气冲冲地穿过房间，震惊得让其他人愣在原地。她再次转身，消失在自己的房间里。

Misato's good humor drained out of her like it was poured off the balcony. She sighed and stood from the plate she used to eat her serving. "Well, you tried. I'm sorry Shinji."  
美里原本的好心情像被倒出阳台一样瞬间消失。她叹了口气，从用来吃饭的盘子旁站起身来。“嗯，你尽力了。对不起，真嗣。”

Shinji said and did nothing as Misato had taken her liberty with the meal, then left him alone in the dining room. Slowly he moved to put away dinner, but stopped at a thought.  
真嗣一言不发，任由美里随意处理了餐食，随后将他独自留在餐厅。他缓缓起身准备收拾晚餐，却因一个念头停了下来。

Much later he set down the plate with a serving of dinner in front of Asuka's door. Straightening, he said to the sign, "This meal was meant just for you."  
许久之后，他在明日香的房门前放下了一盘晚餐。站直身子，他对着门上的字条说：“这份餐食是专门为你准备的。”

He waited a moment, but with nothing more from her he closed his eyes, breathed in, then started down the hall. He was headed to the bathroom to begin his bedtime ritual with a bath.  
他等了一会儿，见她没有更多反应，便闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，然后开始沿着走廊走去。他正前往浴室，准备开始他的睡前仪式——泡澡。

When he returned to enter his room for the night, the plate was gone. He paused then by the door, and reached up to give his customary knock. "Bathroom's free, Asuka."  
当他晚上回到房间时，盘子已经不见了。他在门口停下，伸手习惯性地敲了敲门。“浴室空着，明日香。”

Nothing. No voice, no response from Asuka.  
没有任何回应。没有声音，明日香没有任何反应。

He faced the door one more time. Fists clenched, he took a breath. "I'm still here. Are you okay?"  
他再次面对着门。拳头紧握，他深吸一口气。“我还在这里。你还好吗？”

He heard footsteps in the room but they stopped. He wondered if she was staring through the door again.  
他听到房间里有脚步声，但随即停了下来。他猜想她是否又在透过门缝凝视。

_Ask her if you could come in.  
问问她，你是否可以进来。_

The thought was tantalizing. More than anything right now, he wanted to look at her and know if she was okay. His hand reached up for the door but he stopped, recalling it. He had said this door wouldn't open unless she wanted it to, and she said nothing.  
这个念头令人心痒难耐。此刻，他最渴望的就是看看她，确认她是否安好。他的手伸向门把手，却又停住了，想起了之前的约定。他说过，除非她愿意，否则这扇门不会打开，而她至今未发一言。

He closed his eyes. "Goodnight Asuka."  
他闭上眼睛，轻声说道：“晚安，明日香。”

Shinji turned, entered his room, and closed the door.  
真嗣转过身，走进自己的房间，并关上了门。

---

Shinji was only passing aware, in the middle of the night, that someone was standing over his bed. He stirred a little and his eyes peeked open. He saw her legs going up into her blue shorts.  
真嗣在半夜朦胧中感觉到有人站在他的床边。他微微动了一下，眼睛半睁开。他看到她的双腿向上延伸至蓝色的短裤。

A huff of disgust. "Idiot."  
一声厌恶的哼声。“白痴。”

Step. Step. 脚步。脚步。

"As-ka…" Shinji tried to utter after her. He saw the heels of the girl come to a stop.  
“阿斯卡……”真嗣试图在她身后喊出声。他看到女孩的高跟鞋停了下来。

He knew nothing else from that night.  
那晚之后，他一无所知。

---

_There's danger. 有危险。_

Shinji woke with a start, his heart racing. Panting, he pulled the covers away and rubbed his face, trying to wake up and piece together the events of the night.  
真嗣猛然惊醒，心跳加速。他喘着粗气，掀开被子，揉了揉脸，试图清醒过来，拼凑起夜间的种种事件。

Had she… 难道她……

_Danger. 危险。_

He followed his urges. He dressed quickly and emerged from his room to see what was wrong.  
他顺从了自己的冲动。迅速穿好衣服，从房间里出来，想看看出了什么问题。

Dim light played through the hall from the living room. He could hear rain smattering against the deck in the early morning.  
昏暗的光线从客厅透进走廊。他能听到清晨的雨点敲打着甲板。

Step. Step. Turn. 一步，两步，转身。

Asuka was in her school uniform at the other end of the kitchen, just in the entry to go to the front door. An umbrella was in hand. She leaned up, staring at him.  
明日香穿着校服站在厨房的另一头，正准备走向前门。她手里拿着一把伞，踮起脚尖，凝视着他。

Their eyes locked for a moment.  
他们的目光锁定了一瞬。

Shinji raised his hand, "Wait-"  
真嗣举起手，“等等——”

She was gone, her sudden absence freezing Shinji in place. He heard the door cycle. His hand lowered.  
她消失了，突然的离去让真嗣愣在原地。他听到门循环关闭的声音。他的手缓缓放下。

_She's in danger. 她处于危险之中。_

Shinji balled his fists. 真嗣握紧了拳头。

_Help her! 救救她！_

---

It didn't occur to him that he had skipped breakfast. Urgency sat in his gut, and he didn't know why.  
他没想到自己已经错过了早餐。紧迫感在腹中翻腾，而他却不知缘由。

_She's going to try proving something with her Evangelion. She doesn't know any other way to exist now.  
她打算用她的福音战士来证明些什么。如今，她不知道还有其他生存方式。_

_Not even with you. And that frightens her.  
即便是和你一起也不行。这让她感到害怕。_

It didn't occur to him to question how he knew all this, either. He just had to see Asuka. To know that she was okay.  
他也没有想到去质疑自己为何知晓这一切。他只想见到明日香。确认她安然无恙。

Muscle memory propelled him into the lockers. That was the only reason he was in base these days, so naturally he would be here. Gearing up in his Eva when he heard the battle alarm. Except…  
肌肉记忆驱使他冲向储物柜。如今他来基地的唯一理由便是如此，自然而然会出现在这里。当战斗警报响起时，他正准备穿上他的 EVA 装备。只是……

He had to step through the NERV inspection tape on the way to his Evangelion. He couldn't board without permission from authorized persons. He wouldn't be launching immediately- with the reasoning somewhere between threatening the commander with the Eva, and the battle which followed.  
前往他的福音战士途中，他不得不穿过 NERV 的封锁带。未经授权人员许可，他无法登机。他不会立即出击——理由介于用 EVA 威胁指挥官与随后的战斗之间。

He had tried to open a private channel to Evangelion unit 02 but Asuka wasn't authorizing his communication attempts. His fist bopped the control stick in frustration. "There has to be something I can do."  
他试图与二号机建立私人通讯，但明日香并未授权他的通信请求。他懊恼地用拳头敲打着控制杆。“一定有什么我能做的。”

He waited, then switched to the general comms.  
他等待了一会儿，然后切换到了公共通讯频道。

Asuka's voice was shouting, "Me? Backup? Support unit 00? No way- Evangelion unit 02 launching!"  
明日香的声音在喊道：“我？支援？协助零号机？没门——二号机，发射！”

Shinji gasped. He had been just starting to relax after figuring unit 00 would be on point. Of course though, his Asuka wouldn't have it any other way.  
真嗣倒吸一口凉气。他本以为零号机会稳妥应对，刚要放松，当然，他的明日香绝不会让事情这么简单。

_She's in danger. 她有危险。_

Shinji grit his teeth. He had no proof of this beyond the sensation in his gut, but it was a certain one. He couldn't let her go out there alone.  
真嗣咬紧牙关。尽管除了直觉外他没有任何证据，但这直觉异常强烈。他不能让她独自前往。

_She's in danger! 她有危险！_

Asuka was already exposed and on the surface. She raged again at the Angel, "Get your butt down here dammit-"  
明日香已经暴露在地面上，她再次对使徒怒吼：“给我滚下来，该死的——”

"Asuka!" Shinji barked, but his comms were still interdicted under NERV order.  
“明日香！” 真嗣厉声喊道，但他的通讯仍被 NERV 的命令所阻断。

"-this is so annoying!" "-真是烦死了！"

The hairs on the back of Shinji's neck stood on end. Her wailing came soon after that. He tried to keep his cool, but his pulse was thundering in his ears. He kept initiating a launch sequence, but halting just short of firing as he knew it would be blocked, and notify the bridge.  
真嗣后颈的毛发竖立起来。紧接着，她的哀嚎声传来。他试图保持冷静，但心跳如雷鸣般在耳边回响。他不断启动发射程序，却又在即将发射前停下，因为他知道这会被拦截，并通知舰桥。

Asuka was wailing, "Stay…stay out of my head! It hurts!"  
"明日香哀嚎着：“别…别进我的脑子！好痛！””

Her screams was tearing him apart.  
她的尖叫声撕裂着他的心。

"Asuka, pull back!" Misato ordered over channels.  
“明日香，撤退！” 美里通过通讯频道命令道。

The girl replied, "No! I'd rather die than retreat now!"  
女孩回答说：“不！我宁愿死也不现在撤退！”

Shinji's fingers were flying on the keys of his Eva controls, trying to find something. Anything. His comms kept being blocked. To general channel he finally shouted, "Misato! Launch me, I have to save Asuka!"  
真嗣的手指在 Eva 控制键上飞速跳动，试图找到些什么。任何东西都行。他的通讯一直被阻断。最终，他向公共频道大喊：“美里！发射我，我必须去救明日香！”

Nothing. 什么也没有。

"Misato!" “美里！”

The captain spat back, impatient, "You're on lockdown Shinji, don't move."  
队长不耐烦地回呛道：“真嗣，你处于封锁状态，别动。”

"I can't stand by and do nothing! I have to _help her!_"  
"我不能袖手旁观！我必须帮助她！"

His father spoke. "Third children, stand down."  
他的父亲开口了。“第三个孩子，退下。”

Shinji blinked. Then, "you're going to let Asuka suffer? Or Die? Father, I have to help!"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。然后说：“你要让明日香受苦吗？还是死去？父亲，我必须帮忙！”

"We cannot risk contamination with Unit 01. Unit 00 is performing the operation. Cease this childish whining at once." Was all Gendo said. The comms terminated.  
"我们不能冒险让 01 单位受到污染。00 单位正在执行操作。立刻停止这种幼稚的抱怨。" 源渡只说了这些。通讯随即中断。

He tried to fire the launch sequence anyway. Once. Twice. Then Shinji's rage flew into the handles, ramming them forward repeatedly. "Move! Move damn you! You moved before when I needed you, why aren't you moving now!"  
他试图启动发射序列。一次，两次。然后，真嗣的愤怒涌向操纵杆，猛烈地向前推了又推。"动起来！该死的，动起来！之前我需要你时你动了，为什么现在不动了！"

He released the handles and started to cry in the cockpit as he curled up, rendered useless. "Everyone… Why is everyone stopping me? I need…to save… Asuka…"  
他松开操纵杆，蜷缩在驾驶舱内开始哭泣，变得无能为力。"大家…为什么每个人都阻止我？我需要…去救…明日香…"

Behind him, hovering within the cockpit, a black and white striped sphere the size of a baseball hung in the air. It shivered.  
在他身后，驾驶舱内，一个黑白条纹的棒球大小的球体悬浮在空中。它微微颤抖。

_I can help. 我可以帮忙。_

The eyes of Unit 01 flashed blue.  
初号机的眼睛闪烁着蓝色光芒。

---

"Blood pattern blue!" Shigeru suddenly announced, astonishing some on the bridge, "detected…. Sublayer 421! The cages!"  
"血纹蓝色！" 志贺突然宣布，让桥上的一些人感到惊讶，"检测到……第 421 亚层！是牢笼！"

"What?" Misato demanded, then blinked as she realized with horror where that was. "The cages- Eva unit 01!"  
"什么？" 美里质问道，随即惊恐地意识到那是什么地方。"牢笼——初号机！"

Maya announced from her station, "An AT Field is forming! It… it's targeting unit 02!"  
玛雅从她的岗位宣布，"一个 AT 力场正在形成！它……它正瞄准二号机！"

Ritsuko demanded, "How is this possible through the subterranean layers? Another attack? No… a connection?"  
律子质问道：“这怎么可能通过地下的层次？又是攻击？不……是连接？”

Maya whirled, "Is Shinji trying to connect with Asuka?"  
玛雅转身问道：“是真嗣试图与明日香连接吗？”

Misato asked, "Is that possible?"  
美里问道：“这可能吗？”

Ritsuko replied, "Unknown. We've never witnessed AT fields used in this way. It's possible Shinji is somehow mirroring the angel's attack on Asuka."  
律子回答道：“未知。我们从未见过 AT 力场以这种方式被使用。可能是真嗣以某种方式模仿了使徒对明日香的攻击。”

Misato whirled, "Shinji! Shinji, answer!"  
美里猛地转身，喊道：“真嗣！真嗣，回答我！”

"Comms are locked out!" Makoto announced, "Unit 01 is refusing transmissions!"  
“通讯被切断了！”青叶宣布，“初号机拒绝接收任何传输！”

High up on the terrace behind them, Fuyutsuki leaned closer to Gendo. "Ikari…"  
在他们身后的露台上，冬月向碇源堂靠近。“碇…”

Gendo said nothing but his eyes were focused. This was unexpected.  
碇源堂没有说话，但他的眼神专注。这是意料之外的。

---

Shinji's eyes were closed, but his imagination was active. What he perceived now with his mind's eye was a vision so vivid he would recall later that it almost seemed real.  
真嗣闭着眼睛，但他的想象力活跃。此刻他脑海中所感知到的景象如此生动，以至于他后来回忆时，几乎觉得那仿佛是真实的。

Shinji felt the barrier in his thoughts. A white wall on a white void with a gentle give as he pressed against it.  
真嗣感觉到思维中的屏障。一片白色虚空中的白色墙壁，当他用力推时，有一种柔和的弹性。

He could feel her thrashing behind the barrier. He tried to find a way in, feeling around the invisible wall with his mind.  
他能感觉到她在屏障后挣扎。他试图找到进入的方法，用他的意识在看不见的墙壁周围摸索。

Pressing his ear against the barrier, he could hear her voice, shrill and desperate. "Mommy! Please! Don't stop being my mommy!"  
他将耳朵紧贴屏障，能听到她的声音，尖锐而绝望。“妈妈！求求你！不要停止做我的妈妈！”

_Mother. 母亲。_

Next to him on the floor in the dark. Mom…ah…  
在黑暗中，他旁边的地板上。妈妈…啊…

Click. 咔哒。

Shinji felt it through his fingers. Memory! A connection! He grunted, pushing further.  
真嗣通过手指感受到了。记忆！一种联系！他哼了一声，继续深入。

She said, "I don't need a mommy or a daddy! I can live by myself!"  
她说：“我不需要爸爸妈妈！我可以自己生活！”

Shinji recalled, _"You don't need a mom and dad." Asuka said, "it's possible. I don't need mine." She lowered her head. "I live for myself, and myself only."_  
真嗣回忆道：“你不需要父母。”明日香说：“这是可能的。我不需要我的父母。”她低下头。“我为自己而活，只为自己。”

Click. 咔哒。

She shrieked again, now with the voice of a little girl. "Sure, I'll die with you mommy. Just please don't stop being my mommy!"  
她再次尖叫起来，声音变成了小女孩的嗓音。“当然，我会和你一起死，妈妈。只是求你不要停止做我的妈妈！”

Shinji desperately struggled to recall something to match. Something whirled over his shoulder then and collided with the barrier.  
真嗣拼命地试图回忆起与之匹配的东西。突然，有什么东西从他肩上掠过，撞上了屏障。

_"I want to show Shinji mankind's bright future."  
"我想向真嗣展示人类的辉煌未来。"_

Click-click. 咔哒-咔哒。

Shinji gasped with teeth as suddenly he was tugged into the barrier. Fingers-hands were deep now. He was committed- he could feel Asuka squirm in the cockpit beyond his hands.  
真嗣突然被拽入屏障，牙齿紧咬，倒吸一口凉气。手指已深陷其中，他已无法回头——他能感觉到阿苏卡在驾驶舱内，随着他的手势扭动。

"Im Asuka Langley Soryu. Nice to meet you.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到你。

"Are you an idiot or something?  
"你是傻瓜还是怎么的？

"Chaaaaance! "机会！

"So look at me!" "所以看着我！"

"No! That's not who I am!"  
"不！那不是真正的我！"

Shinji gasped the barrier and pulled with his might. He wasn't budging in spite of how much he tugged. "Asuka!" He shouted, "help me!"  
真嗣用力地抓住屏障，竭尽全力地拉扯。尽管他使劲拉，却丝毫不动。“明日香！”他大声呼救，“帮帮我！”

When nothing came, he winced, and pushed again.  
当什么都没有发生时，他皱了皱眉，再次用力推了推。

_"I lost my mom when I was four." Shinji said, putting, it out there. He looked at her. "And I hate my father."  
"“我四岁时失去了母亲。”真嗣说道，坦白了自己的过去。他看着她。“而且我恨我的父亲。””_

Click. 咔哒。

The barrier clicked back.  
屏障咔哒一声复位了。

_"I wish she wasn't just bored, then. I wish that had meant something." He said sadly.  
"我希望她不只是无聊，那样的话。我希望那意味着什么。" 他悲伤地说。_

Another pair of hands- hers- touched palms from the other side of the barrier. Her fingers interlocked with his, and with a gasp of her breath she pulled him in.  
另一双手——她的手——从屏障的另一侧贴上了他的手掌。她的手指与他的交缠在一起，随着她的一声喘息，她将他拉了进来。

The gaping maw that opened before him smelled of her sweat and hair. Shinji couldn't resist as he was pulled, screaming, into her red-hued domain.  
在他面前张开的巨口散发着她的汗味和发香。真嗣无法抗拒，尖叫着被拉入了她那泛着红光的领域。

---

"Help me, Mr Kaji!" “帮帮我，加持先生！”

"Sorry, you're still just a kid, Asuka."  
“抱歉，你终究还只是个孩子，明日香。”

Asuka released the man's arm as the scent of Misato- her rival to everything- reached her nose.  
明日香松开了那人的手臂，因为真嗣——她的一切竞争对手——的气味钻入了她的鼻孔。

Kaji stood against the exit of the house. But standing beside Kaji now was… him.  
加持站在房子的出口处。但现在站在加持旁边的却是……他。

Her eyes widened in shock. Then, "What the hell are _you_ doing here?!"  
她的眼睛因震惊而睁大，随即质问道：“你到底在这里干什么？！”

_The wall of Jericho closed / The kiss.  
耶利哥之墙闭合 / 那一吻。_

"You just stand there! You won't help me!"  
你就站在那儿！不帮我！

_The volcano / Fleeing from the failed kiss.  
火山 / 逃离失败的吻。_

"You won't even hold me!"  
"你甚至都不抱我一下！"

Blue hands landed on her shoulders, startling her. Those hands then turned into arms, snaking around her shoulders in a firm grip. _"I'm not going to let go."_  
一双蓝色的手落在她的肩上，吓了她一跳。那双手随即化作双臂，紧紧地环抱住她的肩膀。“我不会放手的。”

It was _his_ voice speaking into her ear.  
那是他的声音在她耳边响起。

She tried bucking him off. "Idiot! I dont… I don't…!"  
她试图把他甩下去。“白痴！我不要…我不要…！”

His smell was climbing up her nostrils- sweat and hair together. His presence was thick and heavy against her- just like in the kiss.  
他的气味钻进了她的鼻孔——汗水和头发混合在一起。他的存在感沉重而浓烈地压在她身上——就像那个吻一样。

"Bah-kah Shiiiiin-" “巴哈-卡什伊伊伊恩-”

_A complement about her looks. / The bathtub drained and cleaned.  
对她外貌的赞美。/ 浴缸已排空并清洁。_

"Innnnnnjjjj-"

_Ditching school / Talking by the TV / "-i wish that had meant something-"  
逃学 / 在电视机旁交谈 / "-我真希望那意味着什么-"_

"Jjjiiiiiiii-"

_Lunch / Exposure / Cello music / Dinner, at her door  
午餐 / 曝光 / 大提琴音乐 / 晚餐，在她门前_

"-iiiiii!" she crooned. Her eyes watered as the universe answered her accusation, somehow, by delivering this boy to her. The boy she wanted, even more than she would have suspected.  
"-iiiiii!" 她低声哼唱着。当宇宙以某种方式回应她的指责，将这个男孩送到她面前时，她的眼睛湿润了。这个她渴望的男孩，甚至超出了她自己的预料。

Shinji spoke against her. "I got you. I'm not leaving you."  
真嗣反驳她。“我明白了。我不会离开你。”

Around them a sphere-shaped shadow, striped black and white, had formed to separate them from the rest.  
在他们周围，一个黑白条纹的球形阴影已经形成，将他们与外界隔离开来。

Wings noticed. 翅膀注意到了。

---

**I MUST KNOW. 我必须知道。**

_I can't let you proceed further. I owe him this.  
我不能让你继续前进。我欠他的。_

**IRRELEVANT. SHE WILL TELL ME.  
无关紧要。她会告诉我的。**

_I'm sorry, sibling. 对不起，兄弟。  
_

_._**.**_._

**…THEN DIE. …那就去死吧。**

Graphs, charts, and tables in NERV HQ no longer made sense. Readings from Unit 02 were enmeshed with unit 01, and the nature of the beam attacking Unit 02 was starting to fluctuate.  
NERV 总部的图表、图表和表格不再有意义。02 号机体的读数与 01 号机体交织在一起，攻击 02 号机体的光束性质也开始波动。

Ritsuko was at a loss to explain any of it.  
律子完全无法解释这一切。

Gendo didn't show panic in his voice, but his actions were tense. "Rei. Deploy the spear. Hurry!"  
源渡的声音中没有显露出慌张，但他的行动却很紧张。“绫波，部署长矛，快！”

In spite of his efforts, Unit 01 was in jeopardy.  
尽管他努力了，但零号机仍处于危险之中。

---

In that embrace, their forms were starting to merge. The walls outside rumbled from the Angel's assault.  
在那拥抱中，他们的身影开始融合。外面的墙壁因使徒的攻击而隆隆作响。

"Idiot! You think you can save me? You don't know anything about me!"  
“笨蛋！你以为你能救我吗？你对我一无所知！”

"I want to learn, Asuka. But you won't tell me anything! I tried to get closer but you keep shying away!"  
“我想了解你，明日香。但你什么都不告诉我！我试图靠近，你却总是躲避！”

"That's because you only feel sorry for leaving me out to dry!"  
"那是因为你只觉得把我晾在一边很抱歉！"

"That's not true! Asuka, I've come so far to be here with you!"  
"这不是真的！明日香，我走了这么远就是为了和你在一起！"

"You'd do anything to avoid confronting your feelings! You go to these lengths just to put your own ego at ease!"  
"你为了逃避面对自己的感情，什么都会做！你费尽心思只是为了让自己的自尊心得到安慰！"

"You… you do it too Asuka! You're just like me! You keep running from me when I try to get close! Asuka, stop pushing me away! I want to help you!"  
"你…你也一样，明日香！你和我一样！每当我试图靠近时，你就逃避我！明日香，别再推开我了！我想帮助你！"

Something stirred in her. In both of them. Shinji felt the floor to his perception start to tumble.  
某种情感在两人心中涌动。真嗣感到自己的认知开始崩塌。

"So…You say you want to help me." Her irises started to turn red. "That's… not enough. It's not enough for you to just help me. I need… more. I need all of you."  
"那么…你说你想帮助我。"她的瞳孔开始泛红。"那…还不够。仅仅帮助我是不够的。我需要…更多。我需要你的全部。"

Shinji gasped a little as she shifted within him. Something unfurled in her. Something large, terrifying, and hungry. Her barriers were coming down as this thing uncoiled from her mind like a dragon stirring to devour a foolish knight. The hunter was now the hunted.  
真嗣微微喘息，她在他体内移动。某种东西在她体内展开，庞大、恐怖且贪婪。她的防御正在瓦解，这东西如龙苏醒，要从她的心灵中蜿蜒而出，吞噬愚蠢的骑士。猎人如今成了猎物。

The red-eyed dragon declared; "I want nothing to do with you, unless I have you all to myself! You are mine!"  
红眼的龙宣告道：“我不想与你有关，除非你完全属于我！你是我的！”

Before Shinji's mind an entire reel of her desires flowed over him. Of physical intimacy, touching, ownership. It backed up against his face and submerged him in a sea of thick, sinuous needs and thirsts. He was suffocating in the dream under her desire, touched everywhere, privacy annihilated. Hands- _hers_- were all over him, touching everything.  
在真嗣的意识前，她的欲望如同一卷胶片般展开，覆盖了他。关于肉体亲密、触摸、占有。这些欲望如潮水般涌向他，将他淹没在一片浓密、蜿蜒的需求与渴望之海中。他在她的欲望之梦中窒息，被触碰得无处不在，隐私荡然无存。她的手——她的——遍布他全身，触碰着一切。

Shinji tried to breath against this onslaught of invasive memories and suggestions. She was smothering him into oblivion. His chest pressed against the onslaught as he tried to breathe, his eyes starting into her wants as it flashed by like a movie reel sped up.  
真嗣试图在这波侵袭而来的回忆和暗示中呼吸。她正将他窒息至虚无。他的胸膛紧贴着这波攻势，努力呼吸，目光开始追逐她闪过的欲望，如同加速的电影胶片。

He breathed once, twice, then said, "If… If I give you all of me, then _I'll take all of you!_"  
他深吸一口气，再吸一口，然后说道：“如果……如果我给你全部的我，那么我也要拥有全部的你！”

The mass of red desire recoiled a little at his own declaration. Suddenly Asuka was caught off-guard with her assumptions checked by the _real_ Shinji. It let him sit up. With a deep breath Shinji shoved his anxiety aside and pressed his own barriers down to expose his heart to her.  
那团红色的欲望因他自己的宣言而稍稍退缩。突然间，明日香被真实的真嗣所震惊，她的假设受到了挑战。这让他得以坐起身来。深吸一口气后，真嗣将焦虑推到一边，压下自己的防线，向她敞开了心扉。

It wasn't a torrent, but the blue of his own desire was a lot faster and a lot more targeted than hers. Instead of the flowing, smothering river of desire, his was a very specific path. First it grabbed her neck, then her arms, then danced up her body to grab her face and press it against his own. His grip was tighter than hers, with a greater intensity and fragility. His limbs shivered with great fear at what she would say next. She was wide-eyed still, surprised into tomorrow that her assumptions of him were as wrong as the night was from the day.  
那并非汹涌的激流，但他内心的渴望比她的要迅猛且精准得多。不同于她那如潮水般汹涌、令人窒息的欲望，他的欲望是一条明确的路径。首先攫住她的脖颈，接着是她的双臂，然后沿着她的身体舞动，抓住她的脸庞，紧紧贴向自己。他的握力比她更紧，情感更为强烈而脆弱。他的四肢因对接下来她可能说出的话感到极大的恐惧而颤抖。她依旧睁大了眼睛，惊讶得仿佛穿越到了明天，意识到自己对他的假设错得如同黑夜与白昼般截然不同。

Both of them could see the pattern in their wishes though. It was the same. Up against one another, they stared into one another's being. "We're-" He breathed.  
尽管如此，两人都能看出彼此愿望中的模式。那是一致的。他们紧贴着对方，凝视着彼此的灵魂。“我们——”他喘息着说。

"The same." She answered.  
“是一样的。”她回答道。

The surreal flowing of their desires started to mix into purple now, forming a parody of the instrumentality so desired by SEELE. Here, in the crumbling shadow of an Angel, two hearts were joined.  
他们欲望的奇异流动开始融入紫色，形成了一个 SEELE 所渴望的融合体的讽刺模仿。在这里，在天使崩塌的阴影下，两颗心紧紧相连。

_Shinji I can't hold it much longer!  
真嗣，我快撑不住了！_

The world started to crack along the walls. A shaft of light stabbed inside.  
世界开始沿着墙壁裂开。一道光束刺入其中。

The fifteenth angel would be beautiful, if it wasn't for what it represented and what it was capable of. The narrow blessing of it's AT field had reached far down to one specific place, asking pertinent questions of the chosen.  
若非其所代表及所能之恐怖，第十五使徒本应是美丽的。其 AT 立场的狭隘恩赐已远伸至特定之地，向被选中的对象提出了切中要害的问题。

That open hand full of fingers had turned into a fist, battering its way in. And now a finger could-  
那张开的手掌，五指齐张，如今已握成拳头，猛烈地破门而入。而现在，一根手指便能——

A savage shout traveled back up the long arm of Arael's inquiry back into the Angel, stunning the being momentarily. Confused, it tried to calm its feathers before reaching out again.  
一声野蛮的怒吼沿着阿拉尔使徒探询的长臂回传至使徒本身，令其一时愕然。困惑中，它试图平复羽翼，再次伸出触角。

Moments later though, the Concluding Word arrived in the form of a red spear. Arael stopped the intruder with the wall of its soul, but that wasn't enough. It insisted.  
然而片刻后，终结之词以一柄红色长矛的形式降临。亚拉尔用其灵魂之墙阻挡了入侵者，但这还不够。它坚持不懈。

The fifteenth angel vanished in a cloud of astonishment, its questions unanswered this time.  
第十五使徒在一片惊愕中消散，这次它的疑问依旧未得到解答。

Evangelion unit 02 was to be isolated since it suffered direct contact. Its pilot was sitting alone on the rooftop.  
由于遭受直接接触，初号机 02 将被隔离。其驾驶员正独自坐在屋顶上。

Behind her, and beyond a line of bio-contamination tape, stood Shinji Ikari. Extracted from his Eva He had passed a cursory medical examination. Shinji claimed he remembered nothing of the event, blacking out after telemetry was lost. There was no sign of Angel contamination within unit 01 either, and no evidence to account for the unusual AT field operations that connected to Unit 02.  
在她身后，越过一条生物污染隔离带，站着碇真嗣。从他的 Eva 中被救出后，他接受了一次粗略的医疗检查。真嗣声称他对事件毫无记忆，在遥测数据丢失后便失去了意识。在零号机内部也没有发现使徒污染的迹象，也没有任何证据能解释与二号机相连的异常 AT 场操作。

Behind Shinji, drifting mere centimeters off the ground, was a pea-sized black and white sphere. It floated to the ground, shivering.  
在真嗣身后，离地面仅几厘米漂浮着的是一个豌豆大小的黑白球体。它缓缓降落，微微颤抖。

_Thank you for this life, Shinji.  
感谢你给予的这份生命，真嗣。_

Then with a small pop of blood, it was gone. All that remained of the Angel Leliel was a spot on the ground.  
随后，随着一声轻微的血肉爆裂声，它消失了。天使雷里尔留下的，只是一块地上的痕迹。

Shinji, clenching his fists, stepped over the flimsy red tape. His feet crunched to a stop beside the second child, then he bent his knees and came down to sit beside her. "Asuka," he breathed, "Are you okay?"  
真嗣紧握双拳，跨过那脆弱的红色警戒线。他的脚步在第二适格者旁边嘎吱作响，停了下来，然后屈膝坐在她旁边。“明日香，”他轻声问道，“你还好吗？”

She didn't answer at first. Then, without words, she reached out a hand and grabbed his knee with a finger and thumb. She pulled him closer. Shinji unfurled, scooted over, and draped himself around her shoulder and head. She leaned into him and let out a long, staggered sigh.  
起初她没有回答。然后，她默默地伸出手，用手指和拇指抓住他的膝盖，将他拉近。真嗣展开身体，挪了过去，将自己的身体环绕在她的肩膀和头部。她靠向他，发出了一声长长的、断断续续的叹息。

Finally, she answered, "Stay here. With me."  
最终，她回答道：“留在这里。和我一起。”

He let a breath out into her hair. "Of course."  
他对着她的头发呼出一口气。“当然。”

Her grip tightened back 她的握力再次收紧

Fin.

_A/N: with thanks to Romulo Nidoking/Asushipper for beta reading this. Also thanks to the Asushipper community for support for these kinds of fics.  
作者的话：感谢 Romulo Nidoking/Asushipper 对本文进行校对。同时感谢 Asushipper 社区对这类同人文的支持。  
_

_I tried hard to answer the situation where, if Shinji had one last chance to turn the tide and help Asuka at the last minute, he could. I feel like I didn't go far enough, but I think this fic is good enough for what I set out to do. I pushed a mini instrumentality connection because, as I understand it, simple comm. messages from Shinji to Asuka here are overdone.  
我努力构思了这样一个场景：如果真嗣有一次最后的机会扭转局势，并在最后一刻帮助明日香，他能够做到。我觉得自己可能没有走得太远，但我认为这篇同人文已经达到了我设定的目标。我推动了一个小型人类补完计划连接，因为据我所知，在这里简单地从真嗣到明日香的通讯信息已经做得太多了。_

_Since I didn't spell it out, the implication here is that Leliel came away from his encounter with Shinji having a more human perspective. Out of gratitude, Leliel returned from somewhere to haunt Shinji's shadow and aid him. Any italic text on its own line paragraph comes from Leliel, text in-line with the main paragraphs is Shinji's internal dialogue. Shinji, however, doesn't know the difference.  
由于我没有明确说明，这里的暗示是，在与真嗣的遭遇后，雷里尔获得了更人性化的视角。出于感激，雷里尔从某个地方返回，潜伏在真嗣的影子中并帮助他。任何单独成段的斜体文本都来自雷里尔，与主段落内联的文本是真嗣的内心独白。然而，真嗣并不知道其中的区别。_

_A/N-Ext: Based on some feedback and a request from within the Asushin community, I extended this with one additional scene (Shinji's rumination just before falling asleep) and updating the mini instrumentality between the two of them. I'm a little tempted to explore some alternative endings, but we'll see.  
作者注-扩展：根据 Asushin 社区的一些反馈和请求，我为此文增加了一个额外场景（真嗣在入睡前的沉思），并更新了两人之间的小型融合过程。我有点想探索一些不同的结局，但我们会看到的。_

__after__

The sun's embers were coloring the sky a hazy purple in the late evening. This was the light that bled into the apartment when Shinji and Asuka finally came home, after the longest day in a while.  
夕阳的余烬将傍晚的天空染成朦胧的紫色。正是这种光线，在真嗣和明日香终于回家后，渗入了公寓，这是他们许久以来最长的一天。

They had said little on the way home until they passed through the front door. Shinji announced to the apartment, "We're home!" It wasn't a surprise that there was no answer. Silence as a response had been the norm now for weeks. Shinji had expected it, and now he wasn't even disappointed.  
他们在回家的路上几乎没说什么话，直到穿过前门。真嗣向公寓宣布：“我们回来了！”没有回应并不令人惊讶。沉默作为回应，已经成为这几周的常态。真嗣预料到了这一点，现在他甚至不再感到失望。

Because standing beside him was The Girl. Her presence was warm now, like a radiator lamp, and he was aware of her every step and swing of her arms as she kept pace with him. Somehow, she knew he was this keen about him too.  
因为站在他旁边的是那个女孩。她的存在现在温暖如同一盏取暖灯，他注意到她每一步和挥动手臂的动作，她与他保持同步。不知怎的，她知道他对她也是如此敏锐。

They stopped just inside the kitchen. He had halted in the door frame, she had taken a few steps to stand beside the Kitchen table in That One Spot. Shinji saw her silhouette painted in purple.  
他们停在厨房内。他驻足于门框处，而她则走了几步，站在厨房桌旁的某个特定位置。真嗣看到她的轮廓被紫色勾勒出来。

"Turn on the light." She said.  
“开灯。”她说道。

Shinji reached out and did so. Under that lighting he could look at her face properly, and she him. For a time both of them just stared at one another, now that they were back in this familiar place. Each of them was going over in their minds what they recalled back there, in The Event. Both were not sure of what to say.  
真嗣伸手按下开关。在灯光下，他得以正视她的面容，而她亦然。一时间，两人只是相互凝视，回到了这个熟悉的地方。他们各自在脑海中回想着在那次事件中的记忆，都不确定该说些什么。

This time it was Shinji to speak. "I… back there… I…"  
这次轮到真嗣开口了。"我……在那里……我……"

"Yes?" Asuka asked. Her tone, for once, was free from condescending malice.  
“怎么了？”明日香问道。她的语气，难得地没有带着轻蔑的恶意。

Shinji blinked and shook his head a little as his fists closed up, trying to recover his nerve. "I… I hated seeing you hurt as much as you were. I… I wanted to help you. I'm… I'm sorry if I crossed a line."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，轻轻摇了摇头，拳头紧握，试图恢复镇定。"我……我看到你受那么多伤，心里很难受。我……我想帮你。如果我越界了，我……我很抱歉。

"Do I look upset, Shinji?" Asuka asked him, her arms coming to her hips.  
"我看起来很沮丧吗，真嗣？" 明日香问他，双手叉腰。

"No… but…" He shook his head, "I… I don't know."  
"不…但是…" 他摇了摇头，"我…我不知道。"

"Shinji look at me." She said. He did. She continued, "Just tell me one thing."  
"真嗣，看着我。" 她说。他照做了。她继续说，"就告诉我一件事。"

"Yes?" “怎么了？”

"Did you mean what you said in there? Near the end?" She asked.  
"你在里面说的那些话，是真心的吗？尤其是最后那部分？" 她问道。

He stared into her eyes. "Yes. Did… did you?"  
他凝视着她的眼睛。"是的。你呢…你也是吗？"

"I did." She answered. "我也是。" 她回答道。

Shinji blinked, looked at the table to consider his words, then looked at her. "Yes."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，目光转向桌子斟酌着措辞，然后看向她。“是的。”

She straightened. "Yes what, Shinji?"  
她挺直了身子。“是的是什么，真嗣？”

Somehow through her tone, he remembered her statement on apologies. He closed his fists again, his heart rate accelerating. "Yes. I… I give you all of me."  
不知怎的，从她的语气中，他回想起了她关于道歉的那番话。他再次握紧拳头，心跳加速。“是的。我……我把我的一切都给你。”

Asuka stared back at him. "Do you promise?" She asked, stepping forward to him. Her move echoed the night of the kiss, until she was standing less than a meter from him.  
明日香回望着他。“你保证吗？”她问道，向前迈步走向他。她的举动呼应了那个吻的夜晚，直到她站在离他不到一米的地方。

"I do." “我保证。”

"Then…" She said, "Then I'll take you. And you'll have all of me."  
“那么…”她说，“那么我会接受你。而你将拥有全部的我。”

Both of their hearts were racing as they stood in close proximity. Asuka leaned forward first, but Shinji leaned in to intercept her. She didn't hold his nose this time. Their contact lasted a lot longer than before, too.  
两人站得很近，心跳都加速了。明日香先倾身向前，但真嗣迎了上去，这次她没有捏他的鼻子。他们的接触也比以往持续得更久。
