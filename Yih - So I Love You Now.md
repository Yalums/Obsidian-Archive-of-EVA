Important Note: I have taken the liberties of changing some things in the chronological events of Eva. This occurs when it occurs and that's all I have to say.  
重要提醒：我已对伊娃的时间线事件做了些许调整。这些调整在何时发生，便在何时发生，我言尽于此。

I know I never hated him.  
我清楚自己从未对他怀有恨意。

But I never really showed him that I cared about him in that way. I guess it's too late now. We've become more like a fellowship than a relationship. There's no one to blame but myself. When I could have been flirting with him in the customary way, I was throwing my taunts at him instead. For godsakes, he calls me Asuka-kun (in the private of course) as if I were part of the three stooges! Either way, it's my destiny now… to only be his friend.  
但我从未真正向他表露过我那般在意他。如今想来，或许已为时过晚。我们之间的关系已更似伙伴而非恋人。这责任只能归咎于我。本应按常理与他调情之际，我却选择了嘲讽他。天啊，他私下里竟称我为飞鸟君，仿佛我是那三个臭皮匠之一！事已至此，我的命运似乎已定……只能成为他的朋友。

I can't say I know when they changed-my feelings for him. Maybe it was when he came back after he ran? Maybe it was when he saved me? Maybe it was always there? I can't really pinpoint when he became more than just Ikari Shinji, the third children. Now he's Shinji-not only the baka Shinji; but something more, something I can't quite figure out.  
我无法确切指出，我对他的感情是何时转变的。可能是在他跑开后归来那一刻？也可能是在他救我之时？又或许这份情感一直潜藏心底？我难以界定他何时超越了仅仅是第三适格者碇真嗣的身份。如今，他是真嗣——不单是那个笨拙的真嗣；而是某种更为深邃的存在，一种我尚未能完全参透的情感。

Perhaps, he was always this complicated, this fascinating. Somehow I never saw it until several weeks ago, a few months before. I can see now, he has more in him than most. It might be the experiences we've gone through when we should be worrying about graduating to the next level of high school. But Wondergirl hasn't held my attentions to the degree that Shinji has.  
或许他一直这么复杂而迷人，只是我直到几周前，几个月前才察觉。如今我清楚，他内心的世界比大多数人都要深邃。这可能是因为我们在本该忧虑高中升级的时期，却共同经历了那些事。然而，Wondergirl 并未像 Shinji 那样深深吸引我。

Shinji's a boy; Rei's a girl. It might be that but sometimes-I just don't think that's it. She's different than me, and I should be intrigued. But I'm not. I can't relate to her; I don't understand her. Then again, I don't really understand myself. Like why I continue to insult Shinji when I mean to compliment him. It's like I can't be nice to him because I'm afraid I'll expose myself. Or maybe it's because I'm scared to get close to anyone after what has happened.  
真嗣是男孩，绫波是女孩。虽然表面如此，但有时我总觉得不止于此。她与我不同，我本该感到好奇，然而我并不。我无法理解她，正如我无法理解自己。比如我为何总在想夸赞真嗣时却出口伤人。仿佛我害怕对他好，怕因此暴露自己。或许，是那段经历让我害怕与人亲近。

It's simply not worth the pain-to love someone, only to be rejected. I can't believe I'm insinuating that Shinji, the introverted one outside (though he is coming out of his shell) would do that to me. Me, the self proclaimed Soryu Asuka Langley, the second children, the pilot of Unit 02. It's just that I'm not as confident as I make myself out to be. I'm more like him than I want to admit.  
爱上某人，最终却遭拒绝，这样的痛苦实在不值得。我难以置信，我竟暗示那个内向的碇真嗣（尽管他正逐渐走出自己的世界）会这样对我。我，自诩为惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，二号机的驾驶员。其实我并不如外表那般自信。我内心深处更像他，只是不愿承认而已。

I've got my insecurities; I've got my doubts; I've got my worries. I'm not the all-powerful goddess that I portray myself as. Half the time I don't know why I'm doing what I do. I haven't fully realized what I really am. I'm frightened of what I don't care to see inside. Am I really the bitch that everyone thinks I am? Am I really that cold and cruel?  
我内心充满不安，常有疑虑和担忧。我并非如自己所展现的那般无所不能。很多时候，我都不清楚自己为何要这么做。我尚未完全认清自己的本质。我害怕面对内心不愿触及的真相。我真的是众人眼中的那个泼妇吗？我真的如此冷酷无情吗？

I'd hate to think so.  
我不愿意这么想。

And I hate it when I get this way, when my eyes begin to tear up and get rimmed with swollen blood vessels. I have such pitiful thoughts when I sink to these depths. It's when I'm in these moods that nothing makes sense anymore. I just let my thoughts ramble along on an unguided path that seeks only more depressing things of which to make myself miserable. My whole world seems to unravel at these moments, my life's support-the threads of which it's made of-untangles.  
我讨厌自己陷入这种状态，眼睛开始流泪，周围布满肿胀的血管。每当我沉沦至此，思绪便变得异常悲凉。在这种情绪的笼罩下，一切都失去了意义。我任由思绪无目的地游荡，寻找更多令人沮丧的事情来折磨自己。在这些时刻，我的整个世界仿佛正在崩溃，生命的支撑线——那些构成我存在的线索——正在逐渐松脱。

Those drops of self-pity continue to build up, my self-loathing overflows the edge of my self-weakness. Why do I feel sorry for what's my fault? It's my life, and I shaped it that way. So why do I sit here doing nothing when I could be doing something? I could change now, but why attempt the hopeless?  
那些自怨自艾的泪水不断积聚，我的自我厌恶溢出了我脆弱的边界。为何我要为我的过错自责？这本就是我塑造的生活。我为何只是坐在这里无所事事，而不是采取行动？我本可以立即改变，但为何要徒劳地尝试呢？

"Asuka-kun?" 阿苏卡君吗？

There it is again, that tends-to-be masculine phrasing that forever labels me as one of the guys. I once thought he did it because he wanted to annoy me or as a sign of teasing, a chance flirtation? But it's just because he thinks I'm a friend, and it's nothing more than that. I'm to him as Touji is to Kensuke. I've now become an analogy, since it's the only way of connecting my name to Shinji's.  
又是那种常被视为男性化的说法，总是让我被归为“兄弟”一类。起初我以为他是故意惹我，或是出于戏谑，甚至是一种调情的尝试？然而，他只是视我为普通朋友，别无其他。在他心中，我如同冬二之于剑介。现在，我已化作一个比喻，因为唯有这样，我的名字才能与真嗣产生关联。

"Asuka, if you don't answer the door, I'm coming in!"  
Asuka，你要是不开门，我可就进来了！

No! I want to scream, but I'm afraid of letting him see my face. I can only imagine that my eyes are flaming with unshed tears. My voice is probably going to tremble if I use it. I remember oh so well the last time he saw me cry. I still am able to conjure that surprise look, the shock of his parted lips, the true revelation that I can shed those tear drops like any other human being.  
不！我真想尖叫，却害怕他看到我的脸。我猜我的双眼一定满含未落的泪水，火辣辣的。一旦开口，声音恐怕会颤抖。他上次目睹我哭泣的情景，我至今记忆犹新。那惊讶的神情，震惊得微张的嘴唇，以及他终于明白我也会像常人一样落泪的事实，这一切都历历在目。

Yes, I am mortal, Shinji. Yes, I can cry.  
是的，我是凡人，真嗣。没错，我也会流泪。

But he isn't mean about it. God knows what those morons in our class would have said if they could have seen me as he found me. Feeling desolated, with a haunted look of bewilderment as if I didn't know who and where I was. My hands tremble as they are now. So cold, it's as if my heart pumps ice. And that forlorn look. I'm still lost; I just don't let him see that anymore. I'd rather have anything from him other than his pity. Even his hatred is more welcome than compassion.  
但他对此并不刻薄。天知道我们班那些蠢货要是看到他发现我时的样子会说什么。我感到绝望，脸上带着困惑迷茫的表情，仿佛我不知自己是谁，身在何处。我的手现在也颤抖着。如此冰冷，仿佛我的心泵出的是冰块。还有那无助的眼神。我依然迷失；我只是不再让他看到这一点。我宁愿从他那里得到任何东西，除了他的怜悯。甚至他的憎恨也比同情更让我感到温暖。

"I'm serious." 我是认真的。

I almost smile, almost. He sounds so apologetic when he says that—good, old reliable Shinji. He never wants to hurt anyone. And he also happens to be so naïve. I don't know whether I admire those attributes and wish I had them, or if he's a foolish and immature boy that needs to grow up. I suppose it's both, really. I want him-want him to grow up, and maybe he'll see my actions for what they really are. Then again, I like seeing him nearly unaffected by all that we've been through. Or possibly, I make myself believe he is unaffected by it when he really is-affected.  
我差点笑出来，真的。他说这话时，语气里满是歉意——一如既往可靠的真嗣。他从不愿伤害任何人。同时，他又如此天真。我分不清自己是羡慕这些品质，渴望拥有，还是觉得他是个幼稚的男孩，需要成熟。或许两者兼有。我期待他成长，或许到那时，他能真正理解我的行为。另一方面，我喜欢看他似乎不受我们所经历的一切影响的样子。也许，是我自欺欺人，认为他未受影响，实际上他已深陷其中。

"I don't really want to do this, but…" his voice trails off as he slides open the door to my room. My face turns away from him so that he can't see the tears that were waiting to be shed. I don't know the reason why he stops speaking, it might have been my silence when I would normally yell at him to get out. Or it might have even been the slump of my shoulders, as if I am defeated.  
"我其实并不想这么做，可是……" 他的声音渐渐消失，同时推开了我房间的门。我转过脸，不让他看见即将涌出的泪水。我不清楚他为何突然沉默，或许是因为我通常会大声呵斥他离开，而这次却选择了沉默。又或许是因为我那仿佛认输般的肩膀下垂。

"Asuka, are you okay?" Asuka，你没事吧？

To hear him say my name with no formalities would have thrilled me scarcely five minutes ago, but I have fallen into the disgusted pity I so loath when others feel it for me. When I feel it, I can't help but hate myself even more than I do when I fail in life. I often ask myself where did that young, vibrant genius girl go?  
五分钟前，他若无拘束地唤我名字，我定会心潮澎湃，然而此刻，我却陷入了那种我深恶痛绝的、他人对我的鄙夷同情之中。每当这种感觉袭来，我对自己的憎恶甚至超过了生活中的挫败感。我不禁自问，那个充满活力、才华横溢的年轻女孩，她去了哪里？

She died with my mother.  
她与我的母亲一同离世。

How I could use her advice now! I know nothing; she knew everything. I miss her so much. I think about her every day and every second. The ache that her suicide causes in me will never go away, it throbs in my veins seemingly only to grow stronger as the years go by. And I caused her death because I didn't make her see the truth. I was the Real Asuka; I am the Real Asuka.  
此刻我多么希望能采纳她的忠告！我一无所知，而她无所不晓。我对她的思念无以复加，日日夜夜，无时无刻不在想念。她自杀留下的痛楚永难消逝，它在我体内跳动，仿佛岁月流转中愈发强烈。是我导致了她的死亡，因为我未能让她看清真相。我是真正的明日香；我就是真正的明日香。

My father doesn't even want me. He saw the corruption early on. I'm not a good person inside. Why else would I be called the bitch? Why else would people fear me? I'm bad; I'm evil; I'm Asuka. Can it get any worse than me? I've hated the best people, and done such awful things to them. My sins will revisit me and torture me as they do now. I wish I could change, but how do I change when everyone doesn't realize I'm not exactly what I seem?  
我父亲甚至不愿接纳我。他早就看穿了我的腐化。我内心并非善类。否则我怎会被冠以贱人之名？否则人们为何对我心生畏惧？我是恶的；我是邪恶的；我是明日香。难道还有比我更不堪的吗？我曾对那些善良之人怀恨在心，对他们施以种种恶行。我的罪孽终将回溯，如现在这般折磨我。我渴望改变，但当周围人尚未看清我的真面目时，我又该如何转变？

"Asuka!" He cries my name out as he falls to his knees by my side; the tone of his voice twinges with remorseful. I can't take it… the tears trickles down my pale cheeks, diverging from their tiny paths into larger ones as disappear into my skin. I cry silently, no sound slipping from my tightly closed lips, the only emotion venting out is tears. I no longer am able to suppress it. I do the only thing I can do… I run.  
"Asuka!" 他跪倒在我身旁，呼唤着我的名字，声音中带着悔恨。我无法承受……泪水从苍白的面颊滑落，逐渐汇成更大的泪痕，最终渗入肌肤。我无声地哭泣，紧闭的双唇未泄漏一丝声音，唯有泪水在表达我的情感。我再也抑制不住。我唯一能做的……就是逃离。

I push Shinji away from me and barely manage to reach the bathroom, closing the door so he can't intrude on my contemptible sorrow. No, I will not allow anyone to see me so weak. Not even him who has seen me weaker than this. No, I will not let anyone comfort me when I should be stronger than this. I have to hide my inner demon. Yes, the bitch is better served by hiding the helplessness inside.  
我推开真嗣，勉强走到浴室并关上门，不让他看到我那卑微的悲伤。不，我绝不允许任何人，包括曾见过我更脆弱一面的他，看到我如此软弱。不，我不会让任何人在这时安慰我，我本应更加坚强。我必须隐藏内心的恶魔。没错，隐藏内心的无助才是更好的选择。

"ASUKA!" he screams outside my miseries. He is not part of it. I don't even know why I am broken today. But I will be better tomorrow. I will find my resolve to be that cruel vixen that cares about nothing when she cares about everything. I will hate him when I really love him. Because, it's not in me to crave for something unreachable.  
"ASUKA!" 他在我痛苦之外尖叫，他与此无关。我甚至不明白今天为何心碎。但明天我会振作。我会找回决心，成为那个看似对一切漠不关心，实则心系万物的冷艳女子。我会假装恨他，尽管我深爱着他。因为，我不该去追求那些遥不可及的梦想。

I can hear his feet shuffling as he walks quickly back and forth across my sanctuary. I'd like to tell him it's no use, I'm going to stay here until my emotions are contained inside my closed box. But my voice would be shaky like my hands are trembling. So I hold back . His heartache only makes mine sharper and more poignant. I almost hate him at this moment.  
我能听见他急促来回走动时拖沓的脚步声。我想告诉他，这样做无济于事，我打算留在这里，直到我的情绪被牢牢锁进内心的密室。然而，我的声音恐怕会像颤抖的双手一样不稳。因此，我选择了沉默。他的心痛反而让我的感受更加尖锐和深刻，这一刻，我几乎对他心生怨恨。

Yet, how can I hate something so Shinji? It doesn't make much sense, but who says love has to make sense? Mostly, it's a puzzle full of pieces that get lost and re-found and just plain don't fit together to make the picture perfect. That's what love's like. It can't be perfect because nothing is. And it's stupid for me to feel the way I feel.  
然而，我怎能对如此充满真嗣特质的事物心生憎恨？这虽不合常理，但爱情何曾讲过道理？它常如一幅拼图，碎片时失时得，总难严丝合缝，构成完美画面。爱情便是如此，因世间本无完美，我这般情感，实属愚昧。

"I'm not leaving," he tells me in a strained voice, like he's struggling to speak because I won't. The emotional tremor I detect has a muffled quality that indicates he's been crying as I have, though there's also a resolve in him that shows up more nowadays. I admire it as much as I wish it didn't exist in times like these. Whereas before he would go to his room and listen to his SDAT, now he just stays and waits patiently.  
"我不会离开，"他用紧绷的声音对我说，仿佛每说一个字都费尽全力，因为我没有离开。我能感受到他声音中的颤抖，带着哭泣后的沉闷，同时也有一种坚定的决心，这种决心近来愈发明显。我既欣赏这份坚定，又希望在这样的时候它不存在。过去他会回房间听他的随身听，而现在，他只是静静地等待着。

I fight the urge to be comforted by him as before. There's the nagging hope that he cares about me more than in the general way. It's a thorn in my side—that hope. It gives me the impression that there's a chance when I know I can't take it. I'm not meant to be happy; I'm not meant to be content. I'm on this earth for one sole purpose-to die.  
我极力抑制着像过去那样寻求他安慰的冲动。心底总萦绕着一丝希望，认为他对我的关怀超越了普通程度。这希望像根刺，让我误以为还有一线生机，明知自己无法抓住。我注定无法幸福，无法满足。我活在这世上，只为一个目的——走向死亡。

Timing has always been a problem for me. Something always seems to interfere. And then the courage to just get up and do the act fades from the fear of the unknown. I hate life, life hates me. So why live at all? I just can't seem to take the blade and slit my own wrist.  
时间管理对我始终是个难题，总有事情干扰。面对未知，原本鼓起的勇气也因恐惧而消退。我对生活感到厌倦，生活似乎也对我无情。既然如此，为何还要苟延残喘？我就是下不了手，用刀片割开自己的手腕。

I realize pills would be easier, but my life's been so painful so why not a little more? It's not like I'm living for someone or even myself. No one wants me-not even my father. I try to deny that it didn't hurt me that he didn't want me around. It worked when I was little, but not now—not when I'm not wanted anywhere.  
我明白吃药或许更便捷，但我的生活本就充满苦楚，再多承受一些又何妨？我并非为他人或自己而活。无人需要我——连我的父亲也不例外。我曾试图否认，他不愿我靠近的事实并未刺痛我。小时候这招还行得通，如今却不再奏效——如今我已无处容身。

Sometimes I feel like I'm made of steel. Everything inside that hurts doesn't make a dent on that outer shell. I'm only what I allow people to perceive and nothing more. The other part of me I hide inside. I want to make myself invincible; I want to make myself impermeable.  
有时候，我感觉自己仿佛由钢铁打造，内心的所有痛楚都无法在这坚硬的外壳上留下丝毫痕迹。我只向外界展示我愿意让人看到的一面，绝无其他。另一面的我，则深藏不露。我渴望让自己变得坚不可摧，无懈可击。

"Open the door, Asuka." 开门，明日香。

I mentally groan to myself. I think Shinji has more persistence than what I thought before. God, I love him. I wish he might hold me and kiss me. However, he knowledge of what I feel for him has come too late. I have to keep reminding myself, it's too late for us. I'm the loner, the desperado.  
我内心不禁叹息。真嗣的坚持超乎我的预想。天哪，我深爱着他。多希望他能拥我入怀，深情一吻。可惜，他明白我的心意已为时过晚。我必须不断告诫自己，我们之间已无可能。我注定孤独，是个绝望的漂泊者。

I don't deserve him. 我配不上他。

"Just tell me you're okay…"  
告诉我你还好就行…

The pleading, the worry in his voice very nearly undoes me. I'm sure he heard the sound of my knees crashing to the floor as I could not longer hold myself up. The tears no longer fall; I have used up every drop in my reservoir. I hope that means I will no longer shed my flaws to him as if he is the one all is revealed to.  
他声音中的恳求和焦虑几乎让我崩溃。我确信他听到了我膝盖撞地的声音，因为我再也支撑不住自己。泪水已干涸，我已耗尽了所有的泪水。我希望这意味着我不会再向他展示我的缺点，仿佛他是那个一切都被揭露的人。

"Asuka, please," he begs me.  
"Asuka，求你了，"他恳求道。

He begs me. I promise I will not give in. Not to him, not to anyone. I will be stronger than my desires; I will not give in to him. But even that affirmation doesn't quite settle my mind into what it has to do for me. I feel the temptation to rush out into his arms surge into my lax limbs. How the sweet urge makes me want to open the door and fall into his arms. But maybe I might be as strong and as cold as everyone thinks I am.  
他苦苦哀求。我承诺绝不妥协。无论是对他，还是对任何人。我会比自己的欲望更坚定；我不会向他低头。然而，即便如此坚定，我的心仍未完全平静，不明白自己该做什么。我感受到一股冲动，想要奔向他，这股冲动涌入我松弛的四肢。那甜蜜的渴望让我多么想打开门，投入他的怀抱。也许我可以像大家所想的那样坚强和冷漠。

I kill the warm emotion that begins to take root in my heart, for why else would I want Shinji if I am cold? For if I am cold, I cannot feel; and if I cannot feel, I am strong. The logic isn't what it should be. But my strength comes from iron nerves, and if I give in to him I don't know what will happen. I'll stay here until he leaves.  
我扼杀了心中萌生的温情，若非如此，我怎会渴望真嗣，如果我心如冰霜？因为若我冷漠，便无法感知；若无法感知，我便坚不可摧。这逻辑并不合理。然而，我的坚强源于铁一般的意志，一旦屈服于他，后果难料。我会留在这里，直到他离去。

"Dammit, Asuka," he curses so sweetly. My frustrations over him blend into his own aggravations over me. "Open the door!" his voice has gained an extra edge of aggression. Good, good, it serves him right. The vindictive moment has come. I'm no longer that nice Asuka I keep inside, but the Bitch everyone thinks I am.  
"该死，明日香，"他咒骂得如此甜蜜。我对他的怨气与他对我自己的怒火交织在一起。"开门！"他的声音里多了一分挑衅。好极了，他活该。复仇的时刻终于来临。我不再是那个内心保持善良的明日香，而是众人眼中的那个泼妇。

In that mode of me, I'm not metal but a mountain. I don't bend, and I don't move. Things do break away pieces of me, but it causes no pain, for Nature is resistant to all things. And when I am her, my burdens fall away from the pressures of gravity on the heights of my cliff. Nothing stands in my way when I am her.  
在那样的我之中，我非金属，而是巍峨的山峰。我不屈不挠，岿然不动。虽然外物会剥蚀我的身躯，却丝毫不觉痛楚，因为大自然对一切侵蚀都有抵抗力。当我化身为她，我的重负便从悬崖之巅的重压下释放。当我成为她时，一切障碍都荡然无存。

Except him who haunts me in my dreams.  
除了那个常在我梦中出现的人。

"Go away, baka." 走开，傻瓜。

I almost can't believe it. My voice is under my own control. There's not a trace of hesitation or sentiment, it's emotionless. Yes, being the rock that sheds no tears suits me well. The Bitch is better served this way. But that assertion doesn't convince me as well as I think it should. If it did, the tenseness of my shoulders would relax and the nervousness of my jaw would cease.  
我几乎难以置信。我的声音完全由自己掌控，毫无犹豫或情感的痕迹，冷酷无情。没错，作为一块不流泪的石头，这正合我意。这样对“那个女人”更为有利。然而，这种说法并未如我所愿地让我信服。若真如此，我的肩膀应会放松，下巴的紧张也会消散。

He unnerves me more than I will have him know. And if truth be told, I hate being the stoic. It hurts to be called the Bitch. Words do hurt more than stones. The scars on my heart haven't healed. I remember every little name I've been called. But I'm every word of what they call me. It's a wonder Shinji doesn't hate me. I've been terrible to him, worse than that even.  
他让我感到的不安远超我所愿让他知晓。说实话，我讨厌扮演坚忍的角色。被称为“泼妇”让我心痛。言语比石头更能伤人。我心中的伤痕尚未愈合。我记得每一个被叫过的名字。但我就是他们口中的我。真奇怪，真嗣竟然不恨我。我对他一直很糟糕，甚至更甚。

If only I could make it up to him. There it is again, that nagging hope that resurfaces at my time of weakness. My barriers fall; my dreams fly. It's the impossible cycle. It's wrong to do this to Shinji, to make him even think I care for him. It will only bring both of us unstoppable pain when it begins fade as I know it will. At least, it will hurt my heart. It's there inside, waiting to be crushed.  
真希望我能弥补他。每当脆弱时，那纠缠不休的希望便再次涌上心头。我的防线瓦解，梦想随之飘散。这是个无解的循环。让真嗣误以为我在乎他，实在不该。这只会为我们带来无法遏制的痛苦，我知道它终将消退。至少，我的心会因此受伤。那份情感深藏心底，等待着被粉碎。

"I'm not leaving." He repeats what I hoped he wouldn't. "And if you don't come out in the next five minutes…" he trails off from there as if he's not sure what he's going to do. But to threaten me? Asuka!? The one he's always been terrified of riling? Now, where did the Shinji that always ran away went? Is it possible for him to change so dramatically?  
"我不会走。"他再次说出我本不希望听到的话。"如果你五分钟内不出来……"他话音渐弱，似乎自己也不清楚接下来会怎样。但居然威胁我？明日香！？那个向来害怕惹恼我的人？那个总是逃避的真嗣去哪儿了？他真的能变化得如此彻底吗？

Well, not that drastically. It's not like he suddenly sprouted a backbone. It's been there on occasion, how else would he have been able to save me? He has guts, I'll be the first to admit it. Perhaps the scared Shinji is all a façade, something he wants us to believe because that's what he believes. Warped image to be sure. Trying to hide the reality inside, kind of like me. Maybe I see myself in him. Maybe I see what I could have been.  
其实也没那么夸张。他并非突然变得坚强。偶尔他确实展现出勇气，否则怎能救我？我得承认，他是有胆量的。或许那个胆怯的真嗣只是表象，是他希望我们相信的，因为他自己也是这么想的。这无疑是一种扭曲的自我认知。他试图掩盖内心的真实，和我有些相似。或许我在他身上看到了自己的影子，看到了我本可能成为的样子。

Not the one that always runs. Not the docile one. But the one that is the hero.  
并非总是奔跑的那位。也非温顺之辈。而是那位成为英雄的人。

He's the one I love.  
他正是我所爱之人。

"One minute," he warns me, but what does he expect? I'm not listening to him; I don't even listen to myself. The bells keep ringing, and I just don't get it. They try to tell me such simple things, common sense. I pretend not to hear. Logic doesn't rule me; I'm the secret dreamer. I wish to be more than just plain Asuka. Am I really meant for more?  
"等一下，"他警告我，但他到底期待什么？我连自己的话都不听，何况是他的。铃声持续作响，我始终不解其意。他们试图传达的不过是些简单常识。我佯装未闻。逻辑无法左右我；我内心是个秘密的梦想家。我渴望超越平凡的飞鸟明日香。难道我真有更伟大的使命？

That burning rhetorical question plagues me. It doesn't need an answer, it's there to affirm. Situated between the cerebellum and the grey mater, it will stay keeping it within my reach. I've a chance to grab at it. I've a moment to be happy. That's if I take it, but I won't. That's not my purpose, to be happy. I always want more. There's never quite enough of Rainbow.  
那个灼热的修辞问题一直困扰着我。它无需解答，其存在本身就是一种肯定。它位于小脑与灰质之间，静静停留，触手可及。我本有机会抓住幸福，但我不会这么做。追求幸福并非我的目的，我总是渴望更多。彩虹，似乎永远都不够绚烂。

Satisfaction, it's not for me. I crave the dream, the fantasy. I want the fairy tale. Yet, it's never going to happen, is it? I can't magically have a father that wants me; I can't resurrect my mother; I can't force Shinji to love me. I'll never have the father nor the mother, but why should I deny myself Shinji? Why? Why? Why?  
满足感，并非我所求。我向往的是梦想，是幻想。我渴望的是童话般的故事。然而，这一切似乎永远不会成真，不是吗？我无法凭空拥有一个爱我的父亲；我无法让母亲重生；我也无法强迫真嗣爱上我。我注定无法拥有父亲和母亲，但为何我要剥夺自己拥有真嗣的可能呢？为什么？为什么？为什么？

Why do I keep asking myself why? Another rhetorical question, but it has an answer. I know why. I don't deserve him. Cruelty does not beget affection. That's what I've been to him, 99 of the time. He probably dislikes me; he may like me. But love? No, no, not that-ever. I need a firmer grip on what's really there. Love is obviously not.  
为何我总在自问为何？这又是个反问，却有答案。我心知肚明。我不配拥有他。残忍换不来深情。那是我对他 99%时候的写照。他或许不喜欢我；他可能喜欢我。但爱？不，不，绝非如此——永远不是。我需更坚定地把握真实。爱，显然不在其中。

But what of the 1 of the time that I'm not the Bitch to him? I'm not exactly nice because I'm not precisely a nice person inside. If I am the kindness then why do I hate myself as much as I do? I despise my being . I wish God would swallow my being and spit out my bones. It's for the general health of not only the world, but also for myself.  
然而，在那十分之一的时间里，我并未对他刻薄，又该如何解释？我并非真正善良，内心并非纯良。若我代表着善良，为何我对自己如此深恶痛绝？我憎恨自己的存在，真希望上帝能将我吞噬，只留下我的骨架。这不仅是为了世界的福祉，也是为了我自身的安宁。

I feel the need to destroy myself. Perhaps I'll be allowed to recreate myself in heaven or hell. Do I even believe in it? I'd like to; I'm more of a romantic than a realist. I'm the one who wants the fairy tale; I'm the girl who wants to be swept off her feet. But it's all fanciful and unrealistic. It's never going to happen to me. I'm more likely to have a tragic beginning topped off by a catastrophic ending. That's the expected; that's the my denoument.  
我内心有种自我毁灭的冲动。也许在天堂或地狱，我能有机会重塑自我。我是否真的相信这些？我愿意相信，因为我是个浪漫主义者，而非现实主义者。我渴望童话般的故事，梦想着被深深打动。然而，这一切都太过虚幻，不切实际。它永远不会降临在我身上。我的人生更可能以悲剧开始，以灾难结束。这便是我所预见的，我的终局。

Logic. Reasoning. Discipline. The basic order. What's supposed to happen, should happen. When it doesn't the world becomes all skewed and putrid, yet there are a few cases of unexplainable happiness. Will I be one of those? Is it even possible with me involved?  
逻辑、推理、纪律、基本秩序。该发生的事，理应发生。一旦事与愿违，世界便显得扭曲而腐朽，但仍有少数难以解释的幸福时刻。我能否成为其中一员？有我参与，这真的可能吗？

No. No! NO! I won't think of it. I will just let what will happen happens. If it leads me into Shinji's embrace, I'll take the opportunity. I won't let my beliefs in what I think ruin my one true chance at bliss. The only chance I have left is with Shinji. He's the only person that still looks me in the eye with some degree of friendliness. Even Misato has an edge up, a protective shield that veils the mirror of her soul from my piercing eyes.  
不，不！不！我不会去想它。我会顺其自然。如果这让我投入真嗣的怀抱，我会抓住机会。我不会让我的信念毁掉我获得真正幸福的唯一机会。我剩下的唯一机会就是和真嗣在一起。他是唯一一个仍然用友好的眼神看着我的人。即使是美里也有所保留，她有一层保护罩，让她的灵魂之镜避开我锐利的目光。

"God, Asuka! Why do you do this?" he asks me with anguish, the pain of his question vibrating down my ear canals and hitting the base of my spine with enough force to squeeze the dried reservoirs of my supply into action. Damn him. Damn him to hell. But no, I could never really do that to him-if I really loved him? And I do. God, I do.  
"天哪，明日香！你为何要这么做？" 他满怀痛苦地质问我，那饱含痛楚的疑问震颤着我的耳膜，直抵脊椎末端，其力道足以唤醒我干涸的情感源泉，迫使我有所行动。真想诅咒他。真想将他打入地狱。然而，我怎能真的如此对他——若我真心爱他？我确实爱他。天啊，我确实爱他。

He's getting to me now. I need some way to drown out the sound of his voice. My hands grope around to find and turn the faucet on. The pouring of water drains the silence down into tunnels beneath the ground. The sea-blue veins stand out on my hands as my fingers tense at the splash of lukewarm water against my chilled bones.  
他现在开始让我心烦意乱。我得想办法隔绝他的声音。我伸手摸索着找到水龙头并将其打开。水流声将周围的寂静冲刷进地下的管道。当微温的水溅到我冰冷的皮肤上时，手背上那海蓝色的静脉因手指的紧绷而更加明显。

I hate this weakness in me.  
我对自己身上的这种软弱感到厌恶。

God, I just want to be enfolded into his thin arms and just cry. Cry out in pain, in sadness, in agony with all the pent up emotions I've kept within that holding crevice. But I'll never do that, will I? I'm too stubborn to give in, to see the logos under the pathos. I don't want my emotions to control me even when it is ruling me because that fire, that drive to be independent—to be Asuka, draws me further and further away from him.  
天哪，我多想被他那瘦弱的双臂紧紧拥入怀中，痛痛快快地哭一场。把积压在心底的那些情感——痛苦、悲伤、煎熬——统统释放出来。但我绝不会这么做，不是吗？我太倔强，不肯低头，看不到情感背后的理性。即便情感正主宰着我，我也不愿被它左右，因为那份对独立的渴望，那份想要成为明日香的决心，正将我一步步推向远离他的方向。

When I want to be close.  
我想接近的时候。

But I can't. I can't. I can't! I'm only the Kensuke for Shinji. The brains and the sidekick, and nothing more. At least, I've got the brains, right? That doesn't stop me from wanting more than that, much more. If I'm the Kensuke, then does that make Shinji the Touji? The image of Shinji even being remotely compared to Touji cracks a smile on my trembling lips. It's so ludicrous.  
但我真的做不到，做不到，做不到！我只是真嗣身边的健介，充当智囊和助手，别无其他。至少，我还有智慧，不是吗？但这并不阻止我渴望更多，远不止于此。如果我是健介，那是否意味着真嗣就是东治？想到真嗣与东治有任何相似之处，我颤抖的嘴角不禁浮现一丝笑意。这想法实在太荒唐了。

For a second in such a deep tizzy, I smile.  
在极度慌乱中，有那么一瞬，我露出了微笑。

And after that moment, the depressed emotions slide away like stressed-over schoolwork at the beginning of summer. I'm suddenly a bit freer than I was before. The encumbrances no longer weigh me down. A smile really is a powerful source of spirit food. It's a miracle, a second before I didn't think I'd ever smile again. Yet, here I am, smiling like the world's gonna end in the next five minutes.  
那一刻过后，压抑的情绪就像暑假初至时被抛诸脑后的繁重学业一样，悄然溜走。我顿感比之前更为自在。那些重负不再令我感到沉重。微笑确实是精神力量的强大源泉。这真是奇迹，就在片刻之前，我还以为自己再也无法展露笑容。然而，此刻我却笑得仿佛世界即将在五分钟后迎来终结。

Maybe it will, and all this inane worry will have been for nothing. Right now, I feel like I could possibly be able to be the Asuka Shinji could not resist. The impossibilities aren't so impossible now. They've become possible-probable. I doubt that they'll last very long. It's nice though to feel capable when I've been feeling incapable. It's like I've found my wings.  
或许真的会这样，所有这些无谓的忧虑都将徒劳无功。此刻，我仿佛能成为明日香，让真嗣难以抗拒。那些曾经的不可能，如今已变得可能甚至大有可能。我怀疑这种状态不会持久。但能在长久无力感后感受到自己的能力，这种感觉真好。仿佛我已寻回了自己的羽翼。

I can spread them any time I choose and fly away—fly far, far away from all my problems—finding new joys to bring another smile to my face. Why can't I be happy? Why do I make myself miserable? I don't have to, but I do. I somehow manage to make myself feel totally incompetent by trying to do the impossible. I'm a Perfectionist. I've got ten trillion goals, and more just waiting to fall from the skies. I've got a never-ending supply of ambition.  
我随时可以选择展翅高飞，远离一切烦恼，去追寻新的快乐，让笑容重回我的脸庞。为何我不能快乐？为何我总让自己陷入痛苦？其实我本不必如此，却总是自寻烦恼。我试图达成不可能的任务，结果却让自己感到无能。我是个完美主义者，心中有无数目标，还有更多正待天降。我的雄心永无止境。

And I've never been really happy. But Shinji makes me smile. So why not try for my little cup of joy? He doesn't have to be the love of my life, but he could. He could. He might be it. How will I know if I don't try? Trying never hurt anybody… What great advice! But what of rejection?! It hurts. God, it hurts. I won't tolerate it.  
我从未真正快乐过。但真嗣让我展露笑容。何不为了那点滴的幸福去尝试呢？他不必是我一生的挚爱，但他可以是。他可能就是那个人。不尝试我怎么知道？尝试从不会伤害任何人……真是金玉良言！但若遭遇拒绝呢？！那痛彻心扉。天啊，痛彻心扉。我无法忍受。

I like to feel loved though. I don't want to love someone that won't love me back. I couldn't stand that. There's a risk in love, though. The rewards are Heaven. The downside is Hell. Between Heaven and Hell, I'd almost rather stay in a half-way building. I'm not up to level of the clouds; I'm not down to tread with the soils. There's no sunlight; there's no dirt. There's only surviving.  
我渴望被爱。不愿爱上一个不爱我的人，那感觉我承受不起。爱情虽有风险，但回报如同天堂，而其阴暗面则似地狱。在天堂与地狱之间，我宁愿选择一个中庸之地。我既未触及云端，也未深陷泥土。没有阳光，没有泥土，唯有生存。

I don't want to survive. I want to Be. I want to Become more than Asuka. I want to Live. I want to Live! That thought bends into the steel exterior of my heart and delivers me from the coldness into the warmth. The trembling turns steady as I decide that I no longer wish for Death, though eventually that day will come. I'm not living to die anymore; I'm living for love.  
我不想仅仅苟活。我要真正地存在，要超越自我，成为更伟大的存在。我要活下去，真正地活下去！这个信念穿透了我内心的钢铁壁垒，将我从冰冷中解救出来，带入温暖。随着颤抖的平息，我决定不再期待死亡，尽管它终将降临。我不再为死亡而活，而是为爱而活。

"Dammit Asuka, why do you do this to yourself?" Shinji cries out, almost dementedly. I can imagine him sinking to his knees in despair, that misery written all over the planes of his face. "I'm here for you. You don't have to do this alone. I'm here _for you_. You're not alone, Asuka. Please come out or tell me that you're okay."  
该死的明日香，你为何要这样折磨自己？" 真嗣近乎疯狂地哭喊。我仿佛看到他绝望地跪倒在地，满脸都是痛苦。"我在这里，你不是一个人。我在这里支持你，明日香。请出来吧，或者告诉我你没事。

I don't know how he knows exactly what to say and when to say it. Especially now, that I've decided to give it a chance, living at least. Loving, I'm not quite sure of yet. But I'm willing to compromise. I'll come out of this sanctuary into another one, and hopefully from there I won't regress back into my Bitch shell. I'm ready to acknowledge I'm not alone.  
我不明白他怎么总能恰到好处地知道该说什么，何时说。如今我决定至少在生活上尝试一下，至于爱情，我还未完全确定。但我愿意做出让步。我将离开这个庇护所，前往另一个，希望在那里我不会再退缩回我的“泼妇”状态。我已准备好承认，我并非孤身一人。

"No, I'm not." 不是的，我不是。

"Asuka?" 飞鸟？

The door slides open as I fall into his expecting arms. Good thing he did because I drag him down to Earth and to me. I'm not in Hell quite yet, but I doubt I'll ever really get into Heaven. Unless somehow I'm able to tear down all those high expectations and unattainable dreams that I have-letting them fall back to the dirt from the clouds. Then I'll be okay. Maybe I am now?  
门在我跌入他张开的双臂时缓缓开启。幸亏他在，因为我将他拽向地面，拽向我。我尚未沉沦地狱，但恐怕天堂之门也永远不会为我敞开。除非我能打破那些高悬的期望和无法触及的梦想——让它们从云端坠落尘埃。那时我才能释然。或许，我现在已经释然了？

"Asuka?" 飞鸟？

"But now I am." 但现在我已经是了。

**End.**
