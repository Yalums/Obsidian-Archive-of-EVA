真嗣走在街上，回到了自己的家，心里想着他爸爸做的那些糟糕透顶的事，比如完全是个怪胎之类的，他感到非常难过，听着他最爱的乐队——绿日乐队，因为他们真是太酷了！

**Laguna Beach, California 加利福尼亚州拉古纳海滩**

The young man woke up in cold sweat, the nightmare fresh in his mind.  
年轻人惊醒，冷汗淋漓，噩梦的记忆犹新。

"OH GOD! It's only an omake! It's only an OMAKE!"  
“哦，天哪！这只是个番外！只是个番外！”

The Evincar sprang up from bed, wiping the sweat off his brow and slowly rising from his uber comfy bed, to stumble into a bathroom full of death and toilets.  
埃文卡尔从床上猛地坐起，擦去额头的汗水，缓缓从他那超级舒适的床上起身，踉跄地走进充满死亡气息和马桶的浴室。

It was then, in the large mirror, that he noticed the insignia tattooed all over his body.  
就在那时，透过那面大镜子，他注意到了遍布全身的徽章纹身。

Small, but noticeable, drawn in what seemed to be some kind of divine Sharpie, was the smiley ":p" all over his bare skin.  
虽小却显眼，仿佛是用某种神圣的记号笔绘制，他赤裸的肌肤上遍布着微笑表情 ":p"。

Needless to say, his scream lasted for more than a few hours.  
不用说，他的尖叫持续了不止几个小时。

When he sprang to, his eyes darted over the horrible markings on his body, and he shuddered.  
当他醒来时，目光扫过身上可怕的标记，不禁打了个寒颤。

Who had done it! Mexicans! Robots! Bob Dole! Who!  
是谁干的！墨西哥人！机器人！鲍勃·多尔！到底是谁！

"WHY GOD! WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME!"  
“为什么，上帝！为什么你抛弃了我！”

"You know, I'm right here you know."  
"你知道的，我就在这儿，你知道的。"

The Evincar turned and looked outside his bathroom, and but of course, there was Jesus decked out in all his purple lacy fin-wait, purple lace! What the-  
伊万卡因转过身，望向浴室外，当然，那里站着耶稣，全身披挂着紫色蕾丝花边的——等等，紫色蕾丝！什么鬼——

"What the hell? You're not Jesus!"  
"搞什么鬼？你不是耶稣！"

Fanfiction Jesus shrugged.  
同人文中的耶稣耸了耸肩。

"I'm Fanfiction Jesus, one of many Jesi, including Caveman Jesus, Astronaut Jesus, and Pirate Jesus, but this is beside the point. Clearly you have no idea where this fanfic is going!"  
“我是同人文中的耶稣，众多耶稣之一，包括穴居耶稣、宇航员耶稣和海盗耶稣，但这不是重点。显然你对这篇同人文的走向一无所知！”

The Evincar shuddered. 伊文金卡打了个寒颤。

"Who cares! Look at these weird little Japanese girl smilies all over my body! For the love of god, what will my girlfriend say!"  
"谁在乎啊！看看我身上这些奇怪的小日本女孩表情符号！天哪，我女朋友会怎么说！"

"Girlfriend?" "女朋友？"

"Alright, point taken. Now tell me, what in the hell is going on?"  
"好吧，我明白了。现在告诉我，这到底是怎么回事？"

Fanfiction Jesus grinned.  
同人小说中的耶稣咧嘴笑了。

"I've come, to show you the wrongness…of your ways. Your path of fanfiction is in sin, my fanfic child. You alienate your audience and readers!"  
“我来，是为了向你展示你道路的错误……你的同人之路充满了罪孽，我的同人孩子。你疏远了你的观众和读者！”

"Readers?" “读者？”

"Alright, point taken, but nonetheless, it's true! You're always coming out with a fanfic every second! And half of those are garbled nonsense involving monkeys and…"  
"好吧，观点我明白了，但不管怎样，这是真的！你总是每隔一秒就出一篇同人文！而且其中一半都是关于猴子和……"

"And Mexicans! I can't help it, dammit! It's my passion, my art, my Eva!"  
"还有墨西哥人！我控制不住啊，该死！这是我的热情，我的艺术，我的 Eva！"

"Well, if you want to get rid of those kawaaaaiii, little tongue-out smileys, you're going to have to play by my rules now. I want you to make something that the people will like for once! Enough insanity, it's not cool! Look at your notes for coming fanfics! EoE comedy! More angst! At least finish what you've started, you can't make ten new fanfics and ignore your last twenty unfinished ones!"  
"那么，如果你想摆脱那些卡哇伊的小舌头笑脸表情，你现在得按我的规则来。我希望你这次能做出点人们会喜欢的东西！别再疯狂了，这可不酷！看看你为即将到来的同人文做的笔记！终章喜剧！更多忧郁！至少把你开始的东西完成，你不能开了十个新坑却不管之前的二十个未完结的！"

The Evincar sighed. 伊文卡林叹了口气。

"What do you want from me! A Hikari/Shinji fic! No, don't tell me, Ritsuko/Shinji? Give me a damn break."  
“你到底想从我这里得到什么！一篇光/真嗣同人文！不，别告诉我，律子/真嗣？饶了我吧。”

Fanfiction Jesus smirked.  
同人文耶稣微微一笑。

"I said something the people would enjoy. I want the purest Asuka/Shinji romance ever conceived."  
"我说了一些人们会喜欢的东西。我想要最纯粹的明日香/真嗣恋情，前所未有。"

"AAAAAAAAAGH! No! For the love of…you, for the love of…dammit! You can't do this to me! What of my credibility!"  
"啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！不！看在……你，看在……该死！你不能这样对我！我的信誉怎么办！"

"Credibility?" "信誉？"

"Alright, point taken…" "好吧，我明白了…"

"Exactly, do it or you'll never be rid of these tattoos! And I'll turn you into what you fear most, KawaiiAngelGurl! You'll churn out Linkin Park songfics, and write about your feelings in hard to read spelling errors! And you'll do really stupid things called 'drabbles' and get hundreds of reviews! HAH!"  
"没错，做还是不做，你永远摆脱不了这些纹身！我会把你变成你最害怕的样子，KawaiiAngelGurl！你会写出 Linkin Park 的同人歌，用难以辨认的拼写错误表达你的情感！你还会做些叫做‘短篇’的蠢事，获得成百上千的评论！哈哈！"

"NOOOOOO! Alright! Alright, I'll…I'll do it…So…It's like this…Shinji Ikari-"  
"不——！好吧！好吧，我会…我会做的…所以…是这样的…碇真嗣-"

---

Shinji Ikari sighed as he stood on the ship's deck, feeling the breeze on his back, much like when he had been hiking through the wilderness on his 'little vacation' as Misato had so gingerly called it.  
碇真嗣站在船的甲板上叹了口气，感受着背上的微风，就像他在美里小心翼翼称之为‘小假期’的荒野徒步旅行时一样。

_A Second Child? Why? Aren't we enough?  
第二适任者？为什么？我们还不够吗？_

The mustachioed captain of the ship sighed, adjusting his Mighty Man Mustache and shaking his head as he watched Shinji and his friends.  
留着小胡子的船长叹了口气，调整了一下他的“强大男人胡须”，摇着头看着真嗣和他的朋友们。

"What the hell! This isn't some playgrounds to bring little kids too! What's she thinking!"  
“搞什么鬼！这里可不是带小孩来的游乐场！她到底在想什么！”

His weakly mustachioed officers could only shrug, going back to their duties.  
他手下那些胡子稀疏的军官只能耸耸肩，继续他们的工作。

Misato peered over absentmindedly at Shinji standing silently and frowned.  
美里心不在焉地瞥了一眼静静站立的真嗣，皱起了眉头。

The Third Child had been improving, that was without doubt, but there were still, brooding, lonely moments in those cerulean eyes, it made him unpredictable and even perhaps a bit unreliable.  
第三适格者确实在进步，这是毋庸置疑的，但那双天蓝色眼眸中仍不时流露出阴郁和孤独，这让他变得难以预测，甚至可能有些不可靠。

_That's why we need Asuka…  
这就是为什么我们需要明日香……_

Misato sighed, smiling at Shinji.  
美里叹了口气，对着真嗣微笑。

"Aren't you excited to meet your new comrade, Shinji?"  
"你不兴奋吗，要见到你的新战友真嗣？"

Shinji only shrugged, showing the same apathy that plagued him, even though his friends Touji and Kensuke were cavorting off close by.  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩，表现出困扰他的那种冷漠，尽管他的朋友们东治和健介就在不远处嬉闹。

He put on a rather unconvincing half smile.  
他露出了一个相当不令人信服的半笑。

"I guess so, as long as he's pleasant."  
"我想是的，只要他态度好。"

Misato raised an eyebrow.  
美里挑了挑眉。

"He? Don't they tell you anything Shinji? He's a she!"  
"他？他们没告诉你吗，真嗣？她是个女生！"

Shinji blushed. 真嗣脸红了。

"T-They have that sort of surgery now!"  
“现、现在已经有那种手术了！”

Misato sighed. 美里叹了口气。

"No, your new pilot comrade, the Second Child, is a _girl_, Asuk-"  
"不，你的新驾驶员伙伴，二号机驾驶员，是个女孩，叫 Asuk-"

"Asuka Langley Sohryu! It's been a long time Misato."  
"Asuka Langley Sohryu！好久不见了，美里。"

"Hi Asuka." "嗨，Asuka。"

Misato replied with a quiet sigh, turning to face what she knew was the red-haired girl, but the lean, smirking man behind her was even more of an unwelcome startle.  
美里轻叹一声，转身面对她知道是那位红发女孩的方向，但站在她身后的那个瘦削、带着讥笑的男人更让她感到意外的惊吓。

_Kaji! 加持！_

"What the hell are you doing here!"  
“你到底在这里干什么！”

"Mr. Kaji's my escort and guardian"  
“鹭巢先生是我的陪同和监护人。”

Asuka replied, beaming as Kaji tried to wrench his arm free from her Lover's Death Grasp.  
明日香回答道，笑容灿烂，而加持正试图从她的‘恋人必杀紧握’中挣脱出自己的手臂。

Shinji sighed as Touji and Kensuke sidled up along side him, Touji clearly staring at Asuka's dress fluttering in the wind exposing her long delicate legs.  
真嗣叹了口气，东治和健介悄悄地靠了过来，东治明显盯着明日香随风飘动的裙子，露出了她那修长细腻的双腿。

"Ay Shinji, who's dis skoyt?"  
"哎，真嗣，这妞是谁？"

"Wow, she's hot, eh Touji?"  
"哇，她真辣，对吧，阿薰？"

Shinji only sighed once more and then stiffened abruptly as the Second Child strode in determination towards the Three Stooges, leaving Kaji to laugh and Misato to bicker.  
真嗣再次叹了口气，随即突然僵住，因为二号机驾驶员坚定地走向了三个傻瓜，留下加持在笑，美里在争吵。

Shinji almost shuddered, a cold clammy feeling on his inside.  
真嗣几乎打了个寒颤，内心涌起一股冰冷而黏腻的感觉。

This girl was odd, he knew she was trouble from the very beginning, from the determined look in her eyes; she almost seemed like a predator…  
这个女孩很古怪，他从一开始就知道她是个麻烦，从她眼中坚定的神情就能看出来；她几乎像是一个捕食者……

_Shark…shark eyes… 鲨鱼……鲨鱼眼……_

Asuka smirked dramatically and then yawned in faux boredom.  
明日香夸张地扬起嘴角，然后装作无聊地打了个哈欠。

"So where's the Third Child huh? Which one of these wimps is he? He is supposed to be so amazing for defeating the Third and Fourth angels all by himself. Hmph, dumpkoff! Child's play."  
“那么，第三适格者在哪里呢？这些废物中的哪一个？他不是号称单枪匹马击败了第三和第四使徒吗？哼，蠢货！小孩子的把戏。”

She snorted as she eyed Touji warily.  
她轻蔑地哼了一声，警惕地打量着真嗣。

"Hmm, too stupid-looking."  
"哼，太傻了。"

"Hey, who you callin-." "嘿，你说谁傻——"

But by then she'd already shifted over to Kensuke.  
但那时她已经转向了健介。

"Eh, too nerdy." “呃，太书呆子气了。”

Kensuke sighed in nerdgasm  
健介叹息着，沉浸在极客的快感中

_Oh, to have such a hot babe bossing me around all the time…Wow…  
哦，能有个这么火辣的美女老板一直指挥我……哇……_

Finally her eyes shifted in contemplation on Shinji Ikari, and she frowned, though any judgement she was ready to pass was interrupted by Touji, who was fuming, a vein bulging comically (and possibly an early warning sign of juvenile diabetes. ) in the center of his forehead.  
最终，她的目光转向了碇真嗣，眉头微皱，尽管她正准备做出评判，却被怒气冲冲的东治打断，他额头上一条青筋夸张地凸起（或许是青少年糖尿病的早期预警信号。）。

He roughly grabbed her shoulder. A big mistake.  
他粗鲁地抓住她的肩膀。这是个巨大的错误。

"Ay! Who youse think you are, callin me stupid!"  
“哎！你以为你是谁，敢叫我傻瓜！”

Touji fell to the ground, stunned from the swiftly delivered hand to cheek connection, Asuka snorting.  
冬二跌坐在地，被那迅捷的一巴掌打得晕头转向，明日香嗤之以鼻。

"Hands off perv. And I said _stupid-looking._"  
“别碰我，变态。我说了，难看死了。”

She whirled back to the Third Child, eyeing him warily as Shinji stumbled backwards.  
她猛地转身面向第三适格者，警惕地盯着他，真嗣踉跄后退。

_Oh great…She's insane…Why can't they just pick normal pilots! Or adults!  
哦，天哪……她疯了……为什么他们就不能选些正常的驾驶员！或者成年人！_

Asuka smirked. 明日香冷笑了一下。

"Feh, figures, the Third Child's a coward after all."  
“哼，果然，第三适格者终究是个胆小鬼。”

She grinned triumphantly, Misato and Kaji still in World War III behind them, Asuka sticking out her hand patronizingly to shake.  
她得意地咧嘴笑了，身后是仍在第三次世界大战中的美里和加持，明日香伸出一只手，带着几分居高临下的意味要与他握手。

"I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu, and I've been trained to the fullest in all Evangelion combat. I'm the Second Child!"  
“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，在所有福音战士战斗中受过最全面的训练。我是第二适格者！”

Shinji warily took her hand, peering at her as the connection of flesh made him stiffen.  
真嗣小心翼翼地握住她的手，目光审视着她，肌肤相触的那一刻让他不由得一僵。

He remembered the last time he'd touched another pilot…His hand on Rei's…so wrong…he couldn't believe it…so embarrassing…staring into her eyes…And these shark eyes now, they seemed so determined and full of vigor, something he had never possessed.  
他记得上次触摸另一位驾驶员的情景……他的手放在丽的手上……那么不妥……他简直不敢相信……如此尴尬……凝视着她的眼睛……而现在这些鲨鱼般的眼睛，显得如此坚定和充满活力，这是他从未拥有过的。

"Done staring, pervert!" “看够了没，变态！”

He realized he'd been absentmindedly holding onto her hand, blushing furiously and then stammering an apology as he released the handshake and abruptly turned around just as Asuka noticed Kaji again, her voice light as if she'd just seen him for the first time.  
他意识到自己一直心不在焉地握着她的手，满脸通红，然后结结巴巴地道歉，松开手，突然转身，就在这时，明日香再次注意到加持，她的声音轻快，仿佛刚刚第一次见到他。  
"Ohhh Mr. Kaji!" “哦，加治先生！”

Shinji sighed, shaking his head at the drooling Kensuke and groaning Touji, hoping he could find some dark nice corner where he could just relax and play his SDAT. Ah, wouldn't that be peac-  
真嗣叹了口气，对着流口水的健介和呻吟着的薰摇了摇头，希望自己能找到一个黑暗安静的角落，在那里他可以放松并播放他的 SDAT。啊，那该是多么宁静——

"Ikari's living with you then huh?"  
“碇君现在和你住在一起了，是吧？”

Misato groaned. 美里呻吟了一声。

"Since when is that your business!"  
“从什么时候开始这成了你的事了！”

"Yeah, let's stop talking about that boooring Third Child!"  
“是啊，别再提那个无聊的第三适格者了！”

Kaji smiled at Asuka. 加持对明日香微笑。

"Is that what you think, Asuka? But without training, in actual combat his synchro-rate still easily exceeds 40"  
“这就是你的想法吗，明日香？但未经训练，实战中他的同步率依然轻松超过 40。”

Asuka frowned and Shinji felt himself inevitably being pulled out into the conflict, though he still remained silent and distant.  
明日香皱起眉头，真嗣感到自己不可避免地被卷入冲突，尽管他仍保持沉默和疏离。

"That can't be true Mr. Kaji. It's unbelievable! A lie. "  
"那不可能是真的，加治先生。太难以置信了！这肯定是谎言。"

Touji slapped Shinji on the back, rubbing his cheek.  
冬二拍了拍真嗣的背，揉着自己的脸颊。

"Man, whatta violent girl, ay Shin-man? Whatdya do to deserve-urgh"  
"伙计，那女孩真暴力，是吧，真-兄？你做了什么才招来这——呃"

Touji grunted as Asuka roughly pushed him away, eyeing Shinji Ikari and only Shinji Ikari, with her scrutinizing blue glare, part anger, jealousy, and contempt.  
冬二闷哼一声，被明日香粗暴地推开，她那审视的蓝色目光只盯着碇真嗣，带着几分愤怒、嫉妒和轻蔑。

"Third Child! You're coming with me!"  
第三适格者！你跟我来！

Shinji sighed as Asuka grabbed him by the hand, slowly but inevitably taking him where she wished to take him, apparently down the stairs into some holding area.  
真嗣叹了口气，明日香抓住他的手，缓慢却不容抗拒地把他带向她想去的地方，显然是下楼梯进入某个拘留区。

Then he saw it, towering over them, another Evangelion! But what was most astonishing, to him at least, was the gaudy crimson.  
然后他看到了它，高耸在他们之上，又是一台 EVA！但最让他惊讶的，至少对他来说，是那俗艳的深红色。

Shinji raised an eyebrow and spoke quietly as Asuka finally released the stiff grip on his hand.  
真嗣挑了挑眉，轻声说道，而明日香终于松开了紧紧握住他手的那股僵硬力道。

"Hmm, Unit Two is red. I didn't expect that."  
“嗯，二号机是红色的。我没想到会是这样。”

Asuka snorted. 明日香哼了一声。

"Is that all you can say! That's not the only difference. After all, Units Zero and One are prototypes, test models in the development process. The fact that it synchronized with you, an untrained boy, is good proof of that. However, Unit Two is not the same. This is a true Evangelion, the first on Earth built for actual combat, the final model."  
“你就只会说这个吗！这可不是唯一的区别。毕竟，零号机和初号机都是原型机，研发过程中的测试模型。它能与你这个未经训练的男孩同步，就是很好的证明。然而，二号机不同。这是一台真正的福音战士，地球上第一台为实战而建造的，最终型号。”

Shinji just remained silent, not sure if he should retort, ignore, or just…well, there weren't many options, this new girl seemed quite unpleasant, no matter how ravishingly beautiful.  
真嗣只是沉默着，不确定是该反驳、忽视，还是干脆……好吧，选择不多，这位新来的女孩似乎相当不友好，尽管她美得惊人。

He thought of Rei, frowning as he imagined the contrast between her and this new girl, peering into those shark eyes so clouded and mysterious, shaking, shaking, shaking.  
他想起了丽，想象着她和这位新女孩之间的对比，眉头紧皱，凝视着那双如鲨鱼般混沌而神秘的眼睛，颤抖，颤抖，颤抖。

The very ground below them shook, and Shinji gasped, stumbling backwards and broken out of his mesmerized state.  
他们脚下的地面剧烈震动，真嗣倒吸一口气，踉跄后退，从那迷醉的状态中惊醒过来。

"W-What was that?" “那、那是什么？”

A familiar klaxon shook the ship, and Shinji's eyes grew nervous.  
一阵熟悉的警报声震撼着舰船，真嗣的眼睛变得紧张起来。

Asuka peered about quickly, her eyes serious.  
明日香迅速环顾四周，眼神严肃。

"A shock wave…Maybe an explosion!"  
“冲击波……可能是爆炸！”

"Wha…An angel?" "什…天使？"

Asuka's eyes widened. 明日香瞪大了眼睛。

"No...a real angel!" "不...是真的天使！"

Shinji spun about, not liking the new, determined, almost mad look in her eyes as she spoke this possibility, hoping to make it back up to Misato to find out what was going on, before-  
真嗣猛地转身，不喜欢她眼中那股新出现的坚定、近乎疯狂的神情，她提到这种可能性时，他希望能赶回美里那里弄清楚发生了什么，就在——

Oh dear, that delicate hand of steel on his hands once more, a firm current of warmth against his skin, and a sure sign of horrible things in the near future.  
哦天哪，那只钢铁般坚硬却又细腻的手再次握住了他的手，一股坚定的暖流透过皮肤传来，这无疑是未来可怕事情的明确信号。

Asuka smiled triumphantly, half dragging him away.  
明日香得意地笑着，半拖着他离开。

"Now's my chance!" "现在机会来了！"

Shinji could only wonder passively, at what he'd done to deserve this, and what sort of creature this Asuka Langley Sohryu was exactly.  
真嗣只能被动地疑惑，自己究竟做了什么会落得如此下场，以及这个惣流·明日香·兰格雷究竟是何方神圣。

Author's Note: 作者注：

Just…don't ask…Read and review, and prepare for the next chapter. Heheheh.  
只是…别问了…阅读并评论，准备好迎接下一篇《一千零一夜》。嘿嘿嘿。

This is my attempt at the Ultimate Shinji/Asuka fanfic.  
这是我尝试创作的终极碇真嗣/惣流·明日香·兰格雷同人小说。

Not necessarily the best one, obviously, but I consider myself (pathetically enough) a student of the Asuka/Shinji form after reading basically every A/S fic on earth.  
显然，不一定是最出色的，但我认为自己（可悲地）在阅读了地球上几乎所有的真嗣/明日香同人文后，成了这一类型的学生。

So, don't worry if you might've found this first chapter too short or too weird, this'll be developing into a long, long series of A/S adventures.  
所以，如果你觉得这第一部《一千零一夜》太短或太奇怪，别担心，这将发展成一系列漫长而精彩的 A/S 冒险故事。

And as for my other fanfics, don't worry, I'll update soon, I just get preoccupied.  
至于我的其他同人文，别担心，我会很快更新，只是有时候会分心。

Until Chapter Two, later.  
直到《一千零一夜》第二部，再会。

OH HELL NO! NO WAY AM I GOING TO BE PAIRED WITH THAT SPINELESS BAKA-HENTAI!  
绝对不行！我绝不会和那个没骨气的笨蛋变态配对！  
  
YOU DESERVE TO BECOME KAWAIIANGELGURL!  
你值得成为可爱天使女孩！

Silvernight: I just want to say this to you...You suck with wrighting, you need to get a lot ofhellp with your spelling. And ya need to stop with sounding like a dum blound from the vally, and it degrass you and your wrighting.P.S. Just to let you know its better to hear this now then later when it might get worse down the rode of life.
我只想对你说这句话……你写作真的很糟糕，需要大量提升，拼写方面需要很多帮助。而且你得改掉那种听起来像是从山谷来的傻大个的口音，这会降低你和你作品的格调。附言：只是想让你知道，现在听到这些总比以后在人生道路上变得更糟时再听要好。

[Draknal](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/807161/Draknal): Well, I'm glad I actually read through your story. After seeing those... "omakes" I was about ready to flame the hell out of you, until I realized they were omakes. My bad! Anway, I like how you have done the serious part of this, keeping everyone in character, and very well at that. But one question, since when has Toji had a Brooklyn accent? Ha ha. I hope you'll update soon, because I love Asuka x Shinji fics! Keep up the good work.  
嗯，我很高兴我确实读完了你的故事。看到那些...‘番外’后，我差点就要狠狠地喷你了，直到我意识到它们是番外。我的错！总之，我喜欢你如何处理这个故事的严肃部分，让每个人都保持角色特性，而且做得非常好。但有一个问题，东治什么时候有布鲁克林口音了？哈哈。希望你能尽快更新，因为我喜欢明日香和真嗣的同人文！继续加油。

[AgentKaji](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/946314/AgentKaji): You had me going for a second there, with that begining...PLEASE DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN! :)Anway, the review...It looks interesting, I'd like to see how you differentiate it from the series, but it's looking good. The fact that it's Asuka/Shinji is always plus. :)"Don't hesitate, move ahead."
你那开头真让我紧张了一会儿...请不要再那样做了！ :)总之，关于评论...看起来挺有意思的，我想看看你如何与原系列区分开来，但目前看起来不错。毕竟这是明日香/真嗣的组合，总是加分项。 :)“别犹豫，向前进。”
