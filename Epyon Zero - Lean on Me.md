It was not the sort of day that one envisioned for a funeral. When people think of funerals they expect that the day will be overcast and grey as if the Earth senses the loss of those who inhabit it and drops a blanket to shield their grief and loss from the rest of creation. Today however, this was not to be the case for those who gathered to mourn the passing of Misato Katsuragi. The sun was high in the cloudless sky as it shone amber light upon the small knot of people gathered in front plain black marker that now rested in the NERV section of the Tokyo-3 cemetery.  
这并不是人们想象中适合举行葬礼的日子。当人们想到葬礼时，他们期望那一天会是阴云密布、灰暗无光，仿佛地球能感受到那些居住者的离去，并降下一块幕布，将他们的悲伤和失落与世隔绝。然而今天，对于那些聚集在一起哀悼美里·葛城逝去的人们来说，情况并非如此。阳光高悬在无云的天空中，洒下琥珀色的光芒，照耀着聚集在东京-3 公墓 NERV 区域前的一小群人，那里竖立着一块简单的黑色墓碑。

For the people there it really didn't matter to _them_ what the weather was like. What did matter was that their, friend, guardian, and lover was departed from this Earth long before her time. The purple haired woman had died in the line of duty, protecting the city from the last Angel that had attacked. The entire party was composed of her co-workers from NERV, both of the Commanders, the bridge staff, Dr. Ritsuko Agaki, Kaji Ryouji- Misato's on again off again beau- and the Children. Also in attendance was Misato's warm water penguin Pen-Pen, who although just a bird, seemed to somehow realize that his mistress wasn't coming back.  
对于那里的人们而言，天气如何其实无关紧要。真正重要的是，他们的朋友、守护者、爱人，在她本不该离开的年纪，早已离开了这个世界。那位紫发的女子在执行任务中牺牲，为保护城市抵御了最后一次使徒的袭击。整个聚会由她在 NERV 的同事组成，包括两位指挥官、桥上工作人员、赤城律子博士、时而亲近时而疏远的男友加持良治，以及孩子们。还有米莎托的温水企鹅彭彭也到场了，尽管只是一只鸟，却似乎以某种方式意识到主人不会再回来了。

The service itself had been very short, as neither Misato or any of those in attendance had any belief in organized religion, it mostly consisted of those who were willing, and able, to say a few words about the deceased. The one thing that was at all strange about the service was not who _was_ crying, but rather who _wasn't_. Although neither of the Commanders shed any tears, that was expected, though Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki did look mournful. Also to be expected was the lack of emotive display from the First Child Rei Ayanami, who drank the entire proceeding in through her crimson eyes. What surprised everyone was that Shinji Ikari, the Third Child and emotionally fragile pilot of Evangelion Unit 01 hadn't she a single tear the entire time. He'd sat there like a stone faced sentinel, disturbing everyone with how much he resembled his father.  
仪式本身非常简短，因为无论是美里还是出席的任何人都对有组织的宗教信仰不抱任何信念，仪式主要由那些愿意且能够对逝者说上几句话的人组成。仪式中唯一显得奇怪的地方，并非是谁在哭泣，而是谁没有哭泣。尽管两位指挥官都没有流泪，这在意料之中，不过副指挥官冬月确实显得哀伤。同样可以预见的是，第一适格者绫波零没有表现出任何情感，她用那双深红的眼睛全程观察着仪式。令所有人惊讶的是，第三适格者、情感脆弱的初号机驾驶员碇真嗣在整个过程中竟然没有流下一滴眼泪。他像一尊面无表情的哨兵般坐在那里，他那酷似父亲的模样让所有人都感到不安。

When the service was over all of the mourners departed in little groups of one, twos, and threes. The first to leave were Commander Ikari and Rei, they were soon followed by Fuyutsuki and the bridge crew, leaving only Kaji, Ritsuko, Shinji and Asuka behind. After a few tense seconds Kaji placed both of his arms around the two Children and murmured "Lets go home."  
葬礼结束后，所有送葬者三三两两地离开了。最先离开的是碇司令和绫波，随后是冬月和指挥部的成员，只剩下加持、律子、真嗣和明日香留在原地。几秒钟的紧张气氛后，加持用双臂环抱住两个孩子，低声说：“我们回家吧。”

Back in the apartment that Misato had called home Kaji, Ritsuko and Pen-Pen were proceeding to get throughly and morosely drunk, since as Kaji put it "She wouldn't want it to go to waste." As they consumed more and more of the beer stockpile Kaji and Ritsuko began to reminisce about their college days together with Misato. They both took little heed to the fact that neither of the Children had been seen outside of their rooms, although they probably should have. Since Misato's death both had been placed on a constant suicide watch by Commander Ikari's orders.  
回到美里称之为家的公寓，加持、律子和 Pen-Pen 开始彻底而忧郁地喝醉，正如加持所说：“她不会希望这些东西被浪费的。”随着他们不断消耗啤酒储备，加持和律子开始回忆起与美里一起的大学时光。他们都没有注意到两个孩子一直没出过房间，尽管他们可能本该注意到的。自从美里去世后，根据碇司令的命令，两人一直处于持续的自杀监视之下。

Sitting in her room Asuka was currently engaged in looking at the floor. She'd stripped off the black veil she'd worn with her dress, but not the dress itself. She was too caught up in her own thoughts to care about what was occurring outside the sanctuary of her room. Most of her thoughts centered around Misato and how is wasn't fair for her to be gone. A few however concerned her roommate and fellow pilot. She'd _never_ seen Shinji act so...... so much like his father. It had disturbed her. Shinji was one of the most emotional people she'd ever met, yet he'd just sat there just blinking and staring. She knew that he cared about Misato, then why hadn't he cried. "Maybe I'll go check on him." she whispered as she tiptoed out of her room and up to his.  
坐在房间里的明日香正盯着地板发呆。她已经脱掉了与礼服搭配的黑纱，但没有换下礼服。她完全沉浸在自己的思绪中，无暇顾及房间外发生的事情。她的思绪大多围绕着美里，想着她离开是多么不公平。然而，也有一些思绪涉及她的室友兼同僚驾驶员。她从未见过真嗣表现得如此......如此像他父亲。这让她感到不安。真嗣是她见过的最情绪化的人之一，但他只是坐在那里，眨眼发呆。她知道他关心美里，那么他为什么没有哭泣呢？“也许我该去看看他。”她低声自语，蹑手蹑脚地走出房间，朝他的房间走去。

Looking at the sign on the door she nearly broke down. The simple piece of framed cardboard said "Shinji's Lovely Suite". Misato had put it there as a joke, but he'd never taken it down. Cracking the door, she felt her heart stop in her chest. Shinji was standing on his bed, his suit jacket looped around the ceiling light, the other end tied in a crude knot around his neck. Bolting over she pulled the coat off of the boy and shoved him down to his bed. "What the hell do you think your doing Shinji?!?!!?" Seeming to shrink back into his bed Shinji had to swallow a few times before he said anything. "It... Its my fault....that...that Misato....." he didn't finish the sentence as more tears streaked down his cheeks. Asuka sat back on her heels not knowing exactly what to say.  
看着门上的牌子，她几乎崩溃。那块简单的带框硬纸板上写着“真嗣的可爱套房”。美里放那儿原本是开玩笑，但他从未取下。她推开门，心脏仿佛在胸腔中骤停。真嗣正站在床上，西装外套挂在吊灯上，另一头在脖子上打了个粗糙的结。她冲过去扯下外套，将他推倒在床上。“你到底在干什么，真嗣？！？？？”真嗣似乎缩回了床上，咽了几下才开口。“这……是我的错……因为……美里……”他没说完，泪水再次划过脸颊。明日香跪坐在地，不知该说什么。

Now she knew why Shinji hadn't cried, he'd been so busy blaming himself that he couldn't. Still she could see where he was coming from. The last Angel that had attacked them hadn't looked overtly threatening. It had the shape of a delta arrowhead. It hadn't been weak though. Its AT Field had been very powerful and it was capable of tremendous speed, using its own body as a weapon ramming the razor sharp point into whatever it chose. This Angel also had an unfair advantage, its AT Field somehow interrupted any and all communications. That had put them at a disadvantage from the start. Misato had somehow got the idea that if personnel were stationed outside of the Geofront with shortwave radios they'd have a fighting chance.  
现在她明白为什么真嗣没有哭泣了，他一直忙于自责以至于无法流泪。尽管如此，她能理解他的想法。最近一次袭击他们的使徒看起来并不特别具有威胁性。它的外形像一个三角箭头。然而，它并不弱小。它的 AT 力场非常强大，并且拥有惊人的速度，能用自己的身体作为武器，将锋利的尖端撞击到它选择的任何目标上。这个使徒还有一个不公平的优势，它的 AT 力场不知何故会干扰所有通讯。这从一开始就让他们处于劣势。美里不知怎么想到，如果人员在 Geofront 外使用短波电台驻守，他们或许还有一战之力。

It had worked too, until Misato had started talking to Shinji. The Angel had chosen that moment to attack again. It had rammed Eva-01 head on, knocking it straight into an apartment complex.  
这一策略起初也奏效了，直到美里开始与真嗣交谈。使徒选择在那一刻再次发动攻击。它正面撞击了 EVA-01，将其直接撞进了一座公寓楼。

Sections of that complex had fallen on and crushed Misato.  
那座公寓楼的几个部分倒塌并压在了美里身上。

For a few seconds nothing had been heard but Shinji's breathing. Then he cried out Misato's name several times. He stopped when he'd seen a hand and a piece of her trademark red bomber jacket sticking out from under a concrete slab. All that had been heard was a piercing, heart-rending scream. Eva-01 hd shot up from the ground, its eyes glowing with unholy fire. Shinji had screamed at the Angel yelling for it to die over and over again. Then he caught it as it tried to ram him again. Pinning it down with one foot he'd rammed his fist down into the Angel tearing its flesh and rending it asunder. When he found the core Eva-01 hoisted the Angel up and impaled it on its Progressive Knife.  
几秒钟内，除了真嗣的呼吸声外，一片寂静。随后，他多次呼喊着美里小姐的名字。当他看到一只手和一块她标志性的红色轰炸机夹克从混凝土板下伸出时，他停了下来。只听见一声尖锐、撕心裂肺的尖叫。初号机从地面猛然跃起，眼中闪烁着不祥的火焰。真嗣对着使徒大喊，一遍遍地叫它去死。随后，他抓住了试图再次撞击他的使徒。用一只脚将其压住，他猛击使徒，撕裂其血肉，将其彻底摧毁。当他找到核心时，初号机举起使徒，将其钉在渐进之刃上。

As she blinked Asuka wrapped her arms around the convulsing boy. "It wasn't your fault Shinji, it was the Angel." The top of his dark head shook several times. "No, if she hadn't been distracted talking to me she might have moved and then......." The boy went back to sobbing. _"That didn't work, I'll have to try something else."_ Shoving the boy away from her Asuka forced him to look her in the face. "So, you think because Misato died that its your fault. Then what is killing yourself going to do. It won't bring her back Shinji." Taken back be her vehement tone Shinji tired to look away, but she didn't let him. "Don't you ever, and I mean EVER try something like that again, do you hear me. I've already lost part of my family, I... I don't want to lose the other." Again there was a vehemence to her tone, but the last part had shocked Shinji. He looked up and saw that there were tears in Asuka's eyes. Wrapping his arms around the German girl her felt her cry into his shoulder. Choking up himself Shinji whispered. "I don't want to lose you either."  
她眨眼间，明日香便紧紧抱住了抽搐的男孩。“这不是你的错，真嗣，是使徒干的。”他乌黑的头顶摇晃了几下。“不，如果她没有因为和我说话而分心，她可能已经移动了，然后……”男孩又哭了起来。“那不管用，我得试试别的办法。”明日香一把推开他，强迫他直视她的脸。“所以，你认为因为美里死了就是你的错。那么自杀又能怎样呢？它不会让她回来的，真嗣。”被她激烈的语气吓了一跳，真嗣试图移开视线，但她不让他这么做。“你永远，我是说永远，不要再做那样的事了，听到了吗？我已经失去了部分家人，我……我不想再失去另一个。”她的语气再次变得激烈，但最后那部分让真嗣震惊了。他抬起头，看到明日香的眼中含着泪水。他紧紧抱住这个德国女孩，感觉到她在他肩头哭泣。自己也哽咽着，真嗣低声说：“我也不想失去你。”

As they both sat there holding each other each Child found something new in the other. Asuka found in Shinji a strength she never knew he had, and Shinji found the soft side he'd suspected Asuka had. They stayed that way for over an hour crying out their sorrow to each other, since they knew that they could now depend on each other.  
当他们俩坐在那里互相拥抱时，每个孩子都在对方身上发现了新的东西。明日香在真嗣身上发现了一种她从未知晓的力量，而真嗣则发现了那个他一直怀疑明日香拥有的温柔一面。他们就这样持续了一个多小时，向彼此倾诉着悲伤，因为他们知道现在可以相互依靠了。
  
The End.  完结。

### Comment
[GRUD](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/32470/GRUD): First, you need either a beta-reader, or you need to do a better self-editing job, as I noticed several typos and misspelled words. Second, I didn't think it was all that dark, but I don't really like dark fics anyway, so I'm not sure I'm the best judge of this category. Third, I thought it was too short to really get into. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good story, and well written, aside from the errors. I'm glad you didn't end it with either a single or double suicide-THAT definitely would've made it a dark fic, in my books. How about a sequel (going towards the "light" this time, rather than dark), exploring Asuka & Shinji's changes, both over Misato's death, as well as towards each other? You've got an excellent premise to base it on, after all. Well, keep up the good work. C ya'!
首先，你要么需要一个内测读者，要么需要做更好的自我编辑工作，因为我注意到了几个错别字和拼写错误的单词。其次，我觉得这本书并不那么黑暗，但我并不喜欢黑暗题材的小说，所以我不确定我是不是这个类别的最佳评委。第三，我觉得它太短了，无法真正进入故事。总的来说，我认为这是一个相当不错的故事，除了错误之外，写得很好。我很高兴你没有以单人或双人自杀作为结尾--在我看来，那绝对会让它成为一部黑暗小说。要不要再写续集（这次是 “光明 ”的，而不是黑暗的），探讨明日香和真嗣在美里之死后的变化，以及他们之间的关系？毕竟你已经有了一个很好的前提作为基础。那就继续努力吧。再见

raanefea: Good idea, but lacks detail. And Kaji would have more brains than to let the Children out of sight. And "suicide watch" means you have to share your underwear with a monitor camera, or close enough, so Shinji wouldn't have had a chance. And some more words about the service could have done the fic a world of good.But the idea is head and shoulders above most A/S fics you get. Keep at it!
想法不错，但缺乏细节。卡基应该更有头脑，不会让 “孩子们 ”离开视线。而 “自杀式监视 ”意味着你必须和监视器共用内衣，或者足够接近，所以真嗣不会有机会。如果能再多写几句关于服务的内容，这篇小说会写得更好。不过，这篇小说的构思比大多数 A/S 小说都要好。继续努力吧！

Christine Callahan: Hi. I like how they got together. Nothing outright because they were still in mourning, very realistic. Maybe a continuation is in order if the idea isn't exhausted. Starting with the discription of the day was very effective. Your writing has a way of immediately engulfing the reader and gets even poetic in places. Keep up the good work. And don't be afraid to explore all kinds of situations, not just love, death, and depression (although they are popular).
我喜欢他们在一起的方式。因为他们还在服丧期，所以没有什么直接的原因，非常现实。如果构思没有穷尽，也许可以续写。从当天的描述开始非常有效。你的文笔能让读者立刻沉浸其中，有些地方甚至充满诗意。继续努力。不要害怕探索各种情况，而不仅仅是爱情、死亡和抑郁（尽管它们很受欢迎）。

Suppy?dat was suppose to b a darkfic no offense but it turned out to be more of a WAFFY kinda fic anyways i wuld like to read more chapters
这本来是一部黑暗小说，无意冒犯，但结果却更像是一部华菲小说，无论如何，我想读更多的章节。
