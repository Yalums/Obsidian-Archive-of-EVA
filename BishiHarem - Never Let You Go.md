The end has come, and she has no idea what to do. SA, I suppose.  
结局已经来临，她却茫然不知所措。我想，大概是 SA 吧。

Asuka lay in the wreckage, in what was the Eva she used to pilot.  
明日香躺在曾是她驾驶的 Eva 的废墟之中。

_I'm not good enough. I'm never good enough.  
我觉得自己还不够好，好像永远都达不到那个标准。_

She attempted to push herself to sitting position. No good. She was too weak.  
她尝试着让自己坐起来，但未能成功，因为她实在太虚弱了。

It even hurt to blink.  
眨眼都疼得厉害。

_Why can't I pilot like Shinji? Or Rei?  
为何我无法像真嗣或绫波那样操控呢？_

_Why? 为何如此？_

_Why? 为何如此？_

But the feelings of sadness and self pity weren't buried in her stomach for long. They were quickly replaced by hate.  
然而，悲伤和自怜的情绪并未在她心中停留太久，很快就被仇恨所替代。

Solid hate. 深切的憎恨

Through her blurry eyes, she could see the shards of the crimson metal lying everywhere.  
她透过朦胧的视线，看到赤红色的金属碎片遍布四周。

_Damn Eva! 伊娃真讨厌！_

_Damn Shinji! 真嗣，真该死！_

_Damn Rei! 真是个讨厌的玲！_

_I hate them! 我真的很讨厌他们！_

_I HATE THEM! 我讨厌他们！_

The overhead sun was shining too brightly in her eyes, it made it even harder to see.  
头顶的阳光过于刺眼，使得她更难以看清前方。

_Damn sun! What the hell's it shining for anyway!  
这该死的太阳！到底它为什么要发光啊！_

_I hate it! 我真的很不喜欢它！_

_I hate **everyone** and **everything**!  
我对所有人、所有事物都感到厌恶！_

It was mid-afternoon. 那时正值午后时分。

She was still lying there.  
她依旧躺在那儿。

Her body…broken…her soul...her spirit…  
她的身躯支离破碎，灵魂与精神亦然……

All gone. 全都消失了。

Shattered into pieces. 破碎成片。

She heard footsteps? 她是否听到了脚步声？

_People are alive around here?  
这附近有人居住吗？_

A shadow loomed overhead.  
一个影子隐约笼罩在头顶。

She wanted to scream. 她真想大声尖叫。

She wanted to scream, "No! Don't touch me! I'll kill you!"  
她几乎要尖叫出来：“不！别碰我！我要跟你拼命！”

But at the moment, she couldn't say anything.  
然而此时此刻，她哑口无言。

"Asuka?" 是明日香吗？

_Oh god. 哎呀，我的天。_

_Shinji. 真嗣。_

"I've come to help you."  
我来帮你了。

_No, don't touch me, stop it! Get the hell away from me!  
不，别碰我，住手！离我远点！_

"You're safe now." 你现在很安全。

_Get away! Get lost! 走开！别烦我！_

"We're going to be alright."  
我们一切都会好起来的。

_Oh, how the hell would you know!  
哎，你怎么会知道呢！_

He scoopedher upand held her in his arms, cradling her as if she were a baby.  
他一把将她抱起，紧紧搂在怀中，仿佛她是个婴孩般呵护着。

_I SAID, DON'T TOUCH ME! I'LL KILL YOU! I SWEAR I WILL!  
我说了，别碰我！我会杀了你！我发誓！_

"Asuka, it'll be alright. I don't even know if you're listening, but it will."  
明日香，一切都会好起来的。虽然我不确定你是否在听，但请相信，一切都会变好的。

_Yes, I'm listening! And how are **you** so sure!  
是的，我在听！你怎么这么肯定呢！_

"Because I love you." 因为我深深爱着你。

…_what?_ …什么？

"And I promise I'll take of you, okay?"  
“我会好好照顾你的，好吗？”

_You're just saying that. 你只是随口说说而已。_

"I care for you as a friend, and even more than that."  
我像对待朋友一样关心你，甚至超越了这一点。

…_you do?_ …你怎么样？

"So just trust me, okay?"  
所以，就相信我吧，好吗？

_Okay. 好的。_

And for the first time ever, she felt as if she were home.  
这是她有生以来第一次感到仿佛回到了家。

**A note from the author: Now, I don't particularly support Shinji/Asuka, but this came to mind and I just had to write it down.  
作者留言：虽然我并不特别支持真嗣和明日香在一起，但这个想法突然浮现，我忍不住要把它记录下来。**

**For those of you who were "offended" by my last Evangelion "fic", all my regrets.  
对于那些因我上一篇《新世纪福音战士》同人作品而感到不快的朋友们，我在此表达深深的歉意。**

**But… 不过…**

**To a particular Mr. Billy Bob, here's what I have to say…  
对于这位比利·鲍勃先生，我有些话想表达……**

**"Well, cry me a river, build me a bridge, and get the hell over it."  
“得了，哭得像条河，建座桥，然后赶紧过去吧。”**

**Thank you. 感谢您。**

**Well, I'm out. 好了，我要离开了。**

[theWanderingANBU](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1075568/theWanderingANBU): I like it, it's interesting and it kept me into it. As much as you're not that much of a S/A pairing person, you still did a good job at it. The one thing though I wish I woulda seen is maybe more about what happened and stuff, expand it more and make it more to where we feel the character and stuff.  With all that aside, I liked it. Great job! I'm glad that I took a look and thanks for liking my story :D 
我对此颇为喜爱，它引人入胜，让我全情投入。虽然你对 S/A 组合并不特别热衷，但你的表现依然出色。我更希望看到的是，能了解更多故事背景和细节，让作品更加丰富，使我们能更深刻地体会角色与情节。  尽管如此，我还是挺喜欢的。做得很好！我很高兴能看一看，也感谢你喜欢我的故事 :D

[Adam Kadmon](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/819499/Adam-Kadmon): "Cry me a river, build me a bridge, and get the hell over it." Amen. Personally, I lean more towards Rei/Shinji, but this was enjoyable. You really seem to have a solid handle on stream of consciousness type writing. It would be interesting to see how it would work in a longer fic, but I liked this just the way it is. A lot of excellent thoughts for Asuka, and a good situation for a little growing up and/or catharsis. An "after" chapter would be cool. But now I'm getting needy. Sorry. I still like.
“为我流泪，为我筑桥，然后自己跨过去。”阿门。我个人更偏爱丽和真嗣这对组合，不过这篇作品确实令人愉快。你显然对意识流写作手法掌握得很好。若能见到它在更长篇幅的同人文中如何运用，定会十分有趣，但我已经非常喜欢它现在的样子了。为明日香带来了许多精彩的想法，同时提供了一个适合她成长或情感释放的良好环境。如果能有一个“之后”的chapter，那将非常棒。不过我现在似乎有些贪心了，抱歉。我依然很喜欢。

[Withdrawn](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/955002/Withdrawn): I wanna say that this is nice, but that would be a lie. This fic is well written, has a solid concept, and provokes emotions in the reader that the writer intended, but the word nice just does NOT fit. It is good though, and I think it is extrememly well written, especially Asuka's thoughts. Oh, and I totally agree with what you said about 'Mr. Billy bob'.  
我本想说这很不错，但那会是谎言。这篇小说文笔出色，构思扎实，能引发读者产生作者预期的情感，但“不错”这个词并不贴切。尽管如此，它的确很好，尤其是明日香的想法，写得非常精彩。对了，我完全同意你关于“比利·鲍勃先生”的看法。

[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): Nice little ficcy to read, and with more practice and stories you will improve. BTW most spamm reviewers are usually people who can't put an idea together if their life depended on it! dennisud.
这是一篇读起来很棒的短篇小说，随着你不断练习和积累更多故事，你的写作水平将会提高。顺便提一下，那些经常发表垃圾评论的人，通常是连一个完整想法都难以拼凑出来的人，仿佛他们的生命就依赖于此。丹尼斯·尤德参上。
