<p align="right">"Friction"; Maria Teresa Salazar</p>
On the subway train home, she watches the darkness pass idly by in a tunnel of cement and metal lit only by pinpricks of dim orange.  
在回家的地铁上，她看着黑暗在水泥和金属构成的隧道中悠闲地掠过，只有零星几点昏暗的橙色灯光点缀其间。

The car was empty save for herself and two others—a boy with brown hair, looking unsure of himself, as he stood beside another girl with skin so pale, she was devoid of blood.  
车厢里空荡荡的，除了她和另外两人——一个棕色头发的男孩，看起来有些局促不安，站在另一个皮肤苍白得毫无血色的女孩旁边。

And she thought to herself, morbidly, Given who we are, the car IS empty. A laughable observation; and an utterly mindless one at that, as well.  
她暗自思忖，病态地想，考虑到我们的身份，这车厢确实是空的。一个可笑的观察；而且还是完全无意义的。

Her heart did not break.  
她的心并未破碎。

She settled more comfortably in her seat, her eyes not leaving the sight of her two companions, both of which were standing by the far side, nearer to the doors.  
她更舒适地坐稳了座位，目光始终未离开她的两位同伴，他们站在远处，更靠近门口。

The dummkopf and the doll. It could be almost hilarious, or it could be worse. Aforementioned dummkopf trying—and failing miserably—to pull off an air of nonchalance, trying to make it look like it wasn't a big deal standing next to Wondergirl  
那个傻瓜和玩偶。这几乎可以算是滑稽，或者更糟。前面提到的傻瓜试图——却极其失败地——装出一副漫不经心的样子，试图让人觉得站在神奇女孩旁边没什么大不了的

even though the car WAS mostly empty.  
尽管那辆车基本上是空的。

Wondergirl, however, was being her usual impassive self.  
然而，神奇女孩一如既往地保持着她那冷漠的态度。

Puh-leeze. Dummkopf wasn't even being exactly subtle. And as for doll-girl-— well, what sort of obscene pleasure did she derive from her game?  
拜托。傻瓜头甚至都不怎么隐晦。至于那个玩偶女孩——她从她的游戏中得到了什么样的变态快感呢？

She tossed her hair and rolled her eyes. But mostly, she wanted her hands on something especially hard just so she could bludgeon them both with it.  
她甩了甩头发，翻了个白眼。但说到底，她只是想手里有件特别硬的东西，好用它把他们俩都砸个稀巴烂。

The train halted abruptly at the next station, and doll-girl begins to fall from the sudden loss of balance.  
列车在下一站突然停下，玩偶女孩因突如其来的失衡开始跌落。

The dummkopf, however, conveniently catches the doll before she comes into contact with the metal floor. The doors slide closed, and the subway resumes movement.  
然而，那个傻瓜恰巧在玩偶女孩触地前接住了她。车门缓缓关闭，地铁重新启动。

She notes that the dummkopf has yet to let go of the doll's hand. A-ha. How predictable. Well, congratulations were in order for the idiote! The gutless bastard had to resort to such tactics just for a touch of Wondergirl's hand? Mein Gott in Himmel. He could've just picked it up from the beginning, there's nothing to it. The doll wouldn't mind—- Wondergirl never minded anything anyway.  
她注意到那个笨蛋还没放开娃娃的手。啊哈，真是可预见。好吧，得恭喜这个傻瓜了！那个没胆的混蛋为了能摸一下奇迹女孩的手，竟然用这种手段？我的天啊。他本可以从一开始就拿起它，没什么大不了的。娃娃不会介意——奇迹女孩从来不在意任何事。

She turned away and tried to look out the windows. Nothing still but passing darkness.  
她转过身，试图望向窗外。除了掠过的黑暗，依然什么也没有。

Her heart did not break.  
她的心并没有碎。

Today, she will walk home, alone, because the dummkopf needs to run through some tests again. Both him and doll-girl—synchronization and all that crap. That also meant, in short, that she was in charge of dinner tonight lest the multitudes hiding within Misato starve and they, again, turn to the solace of instant noodles. Verdammt. Dummkopf didn't account for much but Misato she wondered with morbid fascination why Misato never bloated up, no matter how she ate.  
今天，她得独自走回家，因为那个笨蛋又要重新做些测试。他和那个娃娃女孩——同步什么的那些破事。简而言之，这也意味着今晚她得负责做饭，免得躲在美里体内的那些家伙饿肚子，他们又得靠方便面来安慰自己。该死。笨蛋没啥用处，但美里她却带着一种病态的好奇心想知道，为什么美里怎么吃都不胖。

The silence filling the car was thick enough to be served on toast. She was startled, then, to realize that she-and the rest of them'- had gone to be so accustomed to the quiet that they minded it no longer. Not like there was anything to talk about with these two—- just that  
车内的寂静浓得可以涂在吐司上。她惊讶地意识到，自己和他们已经习惯了这种安静，不再介意了。和这两个人没什么好聊的——只是这样而已。

It's a sick, sick way to live, she deduced.  
她推断，这是一种病态的生活方式。

The train halted and she looked up to see the sliding doors open to let both doll and dummkopf leave, hands still disgustingly entwined. She wondered lugubriously if this counted as an Oedipus complex of some sort, or maybe, incest.  
列车停了下来，她抬头望去，只见滑动门打开，让玩偶和傻瓜一同下车，双手依旧令人作呕地缠绕在一起。她忧郁地思索着，这是否算是一种某种形式的俄狄浦斯情结，抑或是乱伦。

The doors closed, and she was left alone.  
门关上了，她独自一人留在那里。

Her heart did break.  
她的心确实碎了。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
She entered the little apartment she shared with the dummkopf and Misato and threw her book bag in the general direction of... anywhere. What did it matter, the place was a dump when she first arrived and it remained so and will remain as such until the Third Impact. There was something to the effect of a loud yelp as Misato's abnormal penguin ducked for cover. She paid it no mind.  
她走进与那个笨蛋和美里合住的小公寓，随手将书包扔向……随便哪里。这有什么关系呢，这个地方从她刚来时就是个垃圾堆，至今依旧，直到第三次冲击发生前都会是这样。随着美里那只异常的企鹅躲闪时发出的一声大叫，她并未在意。

She then stopped short, her right shoulder socket tingling, as she heard the resounding crash of the bag against some unkown, unfortunate object on the floor. One crack! and she came to an epiphany.  
随后她突然停下，右肩关节一阵刺痛，因为她听到了书包撞击地板上某个未知、不幸物体的响亮声响。一声脆响！她顿时恍然大悟。

That actually felt... good.  
那种感觉实际上……挺好的。

She picked up a random object-- a plastic flowered bowl-- and hurled it against the wall, just to see. There was an audible crack as synthetic connected with stone, and she let out a hissing breath through gritted teeth.  
她随手抓起一个物件——一个塑料花纹的碗——猛地朝墙砸去，只为看看会发生什么。合成材料与石墙相撞，发出一声清晰的破裂声，她紧咬牙关，呼出一口嘶嘶作响的气。

It was the beginning of bedlam.  
这是混乱的开始。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
She contemplated matters as she picked up a vase and hurled it away from her, going for force rather than distance. As the porcelain broke into countless little pieces, her heart contracted.  
她一边思索着事情，一边拿起一个花瓶，用力朝远离自己的方向掷去，更注重力度而非距离。随着瓷器碎成无数小片，她的心也紧缩了起来。

Her heart. Heart she forced to fall in line, obey orders. Heart that did not cry at the funeral of her mother, heart that did not weep at the loss of the first man she had a semblance of love for. Why then her heart and that sniveling boy? She had been through much worse.  
她的心。那颗她强迫服从命令、循规蹈矩的心。那颗在她母亲葬礼上未曾落泪，在她对第一个似有爱意的人失去时也未曾哭泣的心。为何如今这颗心却为那哭泣的男孩所动？她经历过更糟糕的。

Her hands encircled a wooden statuette. She threw it with astounding force and it landed on the balcony, broken in two.  
她的双手环抱着一个木制小雕像。她以惊人的力量将其掷出，小雕像落在阳台上，断成了两截。

She does not cry. This she had vowed before the witness of rain and dark clouds and the coffin of her mother lowered to the ground where she now sleeps forever. To this she has remained true for years and years and years. She sheds no tears for death, death of people who believed they were dying for a cause that would ultimately save them. Death of her childhood, her innocence-- she did not weep for these. Neither did she cry from physical pain nor mental torture. She screams but does not weep. Why then her tears for that sniveling boy?  
她没有哭泣。这一点，她在雨、乌云和母亲棺木被放入地下长眠的见证下立下了誓言。多年来，她始终坚守这一誓言。她不为死亡流泪，不为那些自以为是为最终拯救他们的原因而死的人们流泪。她不为童年的逝去、纯真的丧失而哭泣。无论是肉体的痛苦还是精神的折磨，她都没有流泪。她尖叫，但没有哭泣。那么，为何她会为那个懦弱的男孩流泪呢？

She clutched a book, held it tight, and ultimately threw it down on the low table before her. The book upset the surface and random objects either flew off or fell off. She saw the destruction she had caused and smiled.  
她紧抓着一本书，紧紧握住，最终将它猛地摔在面前的矮桌上。书本打乱了桌面，随机物品要么飞散，要么掉落。她看着自己造成的破坏，笑了。

That sniveling, unworthy boy and his doll. His doll, his father's doll, what difference did it make? The son of the man who wanted to be Adam, and ultimately the spirit of Lilith--  
那个爱哭的、不配的男孩和他的玩偶。他的玩偶，他父亲的玩偶，有什么区别呢？那个想成为亚当的人的儿子，最终却是莉莉丝的灵魂——

And what of my soul?  
那我的灵魂呢？

She is only a doll, nothing but a doll. A doll like the others her mother had bought for her, locked now in a room in a grand house never opened. That place she fled, all those sightless eyes staring at her, soundless voices hanging in the air like spells not cast. She hated that house-- hated those dolls.  
她只是个玩偶，仅仅是个玩偶。一个像她母亲为她买的其他玩偶一样的玩偶，现在锁在一座从未打开过的豪宅的房间里。那个她逃离的地方，所有无神的眼睛盯着她，无声的声音像未施的咒语一样悬挂在空中。她恨那座房子——恨那些玩偶。

A doll like the one her mother held in place of her real daughter. A doll, an unmoving unfeeling unseeing all-knowing doll.  
一个像她母亲手中代替她亲生女儿的玩偶。一个玩偶，一个静止不动、无感无知、目无所见却无所不知的玩偶。

Why then a doll and my mother?  
为何是那个玩偶和我母亲？

A ripping sound of paper and the cracking of thin wood as a lamp hit a divider.  
纸张撕裂声与细木断裂声交织，一盏灯撞上了隔板。

Why then that sniveling boy and his doll?  
为何是那个哭哭啼啼的男孩和他的玩偶？

The clang of metal against hard cement as a pot flew and landed.  
锅飞起来，重重地砸在坚硬的水泥地上，发出金属撞击的铿锵声。

Why then that doll and not me-- never ME?!  
为什么是那个玩偶而不是我——从来都不是我？！

And finally, the sound of bone itself cracking as a young girl struck the wall with a force spawned of lonely desperation.  
最终，当一个孤独无助的年轻女孩以孤注一掷的力量撞向墙壁时，骨头断裂的声音清晰可闻。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
She slid down as her own red blood trickled down the wall, eyes still dry but full of tears still unshed, sightless.  
她顺着墙壁滑落，自己的鲜血染红了墙面，双眼依旧干涩，却盈满了未曾流下的泪水，空洞无神。

The door opened and a grown woman yelped in shock at the sight before her. Two secinds later Katsuragi Misato walked in and found the child sitting beside the wall, staring at it as if it held the very meaning of life.  
门开了，一位成年女子因眼前的景象惊得尖叫出声。两秒钟后，葛城美里走了进来，发现那孩子坐在墙边，凝视着墙壁，仿佛那里蕴藏着生命的真谛。

Misato took note of the girl's bleeding hand. "Asuka, what happened?"  
美里注意到女孩流血的手。“明日香，发生了什么？”

To this, Sohryu Asuka-Langley replied, "Shinji no baka".  
对此，惣流·明日香·兰格雷回答道：“真嗣这个笨蛋。”
<p align="right">--Owari</p>
Explanations: This, obscurely, is the easiest Asuka piece I've ever written in my whole fanficcing life. Then again, I AM fairly new at Evangelion fanfiction.  
说明：这篇关于惣流·明日香·兰格雷的文章，是我整个同人文创作生涯中最容易写的一篇。不过话说回来，我在《新世纪福音战士》同人圈里确实还算个新手。

Most people will notice that my Asuka is truly OOC. I realize that and I attempt to explain it. Most people might say she would fight back and not keep her feelings inside the way she was written in this fic (because that is why Asuka is loved as well as feared, because she fights), but I tend to disagree. I wanted to explore the possibilities of an Asuka that was not so forward, so out there, so brash. I believe that behind that stone she is, in fact, a lonely child.  
大多数人会注意到，我笔下的明日香确实有些脱离原作角色。我意识到了这一点，并试图做出解释。许多人可能会认为她会反抗，不会像这篇同人里那样压抑自己的情感（因为这就是明日香既被喜爱又令人畏惧的原因，她敢于斗争），但我倾向于持不同意见。我想探索一个不那么直接、不那么张扬、不那么鲁莽的明日香的可能性。我相信，在她那坚硬的外壳之下，实际上是一个孤独的孩子。

The doll thing. Um, no offense to people who say that Rei is human. But it IS in fact canon to say that Asuka views the impassive Ayanami as nothing but a clone-- a doll. I also came across an interesting piece of information while surfing the net a while back-- it is presumed that Asuka loathes Rei because of her being a "doll" like the one her mother replaced her with. This is, of course, mere speculation used as artistic fodder. Again, apologies to staunch Rei fans. *ducks*  
人偶之事。呃，无意冒犯那些认为丽是人类的人。但事实上，阿斯卡确实将冷漠的绫波视为一个克隆体——一个玩偶，这是官方设定。我之前在网上冲浪时还发现了一条有趣的信息——据推测，明日香之所以厌恶丽，是因为她像她母亲用来替代她的那个“玩偶”。当然，这只是作为创作素材的猜测。再次向坚定的丽粉丝致歉。*低头躲闪*

About Asuka being in love with Shinji-- um, no comment. I'll just say that most of my upcoming Evangelion fics will tend toward the ShinjixAsuka pairing, and maybe even ReixKaworu. That should tell you something about me. ^-^  
关于明日香爱上真嗣这件事——呃，无可奉告。我只能说，我即将发布的多数《新世纪福音战士》同人文将倾向于真嗣 x 明日香这对 CP，甚至可能会有丽 x 渚薰。这应该能让你对我有所了解。^-^

### Comment
[Demented Koneko](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/102897/Demented-Koneko): This was very beautiful. I think you potrayed and expressed Asuka's feelings very well. I also like your idea of Asuka thinking why the doll and never me? Overall i feel really sorry for her for because of her past. When she first came into the series i saw her as an annoying little brat, but after reading some sites about her i discovered that their are many reason's to why she acts the way she does. Great fic! _  
这篇作品非常美丽。我认为你很好地描绘并表达了明日香的情感。我也喜欢你关于明日香思考为什么是那个娃娃而不是我的想法。总的来说，我对她的过去感到非常同情。当她第一次出现在系列中时，我觉得她是个烦人的小鬼，但读了一些关于她的网站后，我发现她之所以这样行为是有许多原因的。很棒的小说！ _

[Hiryu Kaga](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/225423/Hiryu-Kaga): ...OOC? Not really, at least not in my opinion. Except maybe one detail:  'an Oedipus complex', 'the man who wanted to be Adam (...) the spirit of Lilith' - how would she know all this?  Aside from that... it's one of the best Asuka pieces I've read.  
...OOC？不太算，至少我个人这么认为。除了可能有一个细节: '俄狄浦斯情结', '那个想成为亚当（...）莉莉丝之灵的人' - 她怎么会知道这些？ 除此之外...这是我读过的最好的明日香作品之一。

NoStyle: i really loved this fanfic. i thought that you portrayed Asuka's character very well. to me she wasnt totally ooc because there are certain things people are very forward about, and other things which they choose to keep hidden such as feelings of love, much like how i thought Asuka was. anyhow i could probably go on forever, but i'll try and keep it short. this was so well written and it really got the feelings thru to the reader i especially loved the emotion running thru this, it was amazing how well you did that. great job  
我真的很喜欢这篇同人文。我认为你很好地描绘了明日香这个角色。对我来说，她并没有完全脱离角色，因为有些事情人们会非常直接地表达，而其他事情，比如爱的感觉，他们会选择隐藏，就像我认为明日香那样。无论如何，我可能会一直说下去，但我会尽量简短。这篇写得非常好，真的把情感传递给了读者，我特别喜欢贯穿其中的情感，你做得太棒了。干得好！

SHOtoo lazy to log in: 
Overall the fic was pretty good. The angst was also pretty well done considering. You've done a pretty good job for a newbie in the eva section.  
总的来说，这篇同人文相当不错。考虑到各种因素，情感描写也处理得很好。作为一个初入 EVA 板块的新手，你做得相当出色。  
  
Personally i don't think your characterization was TOO ooc. Afterall, the fact that Asuka does have feelings for Shinji and vice-versa has pretty much been established in eva especially in the Evangelion "Directors Cut" series and EOE. Also, like Shinji also suffers from the hedgehogs dilemma. The only difference between the two is that instead shunning away from human contact, Asuka prefers to push people away before they get too close.  
我个人认为你的角色塑造并没有太过出戏。毕竟，明日香对真嗣有感情，反之亦然，这在 EVA 中尤其是《新世纪福音战士 导演剪辑版》系列和 EOE 中已经有所体现。此外，就像真嗣一样，明日香也面临着刺猬困境。两者唯一的区别在于，明日香不是回避人际接触，而是倾向于在别人靠得太近之前就把他们推开。  
  
The only REAL problem i did see with it was regarding how much Asuka DID know about what was happening. She didn't know anything about Gendo's plans as well as Rei's origins until during instrumentality. The only thing she did know was about Kaji's death which was in one of the scenes in the " ".  
我真正发现的问题是关于明日香对正在发生的事情了解多少。在人类补完计划之前，她对碇源堂的计划以及绫波丽的身世一无所知。她唯一知道的是加持良治的死，这一情节出现在《新世纪福音战士》的某个场景中。  
  
Ps: Rei/Kaworu? Now that's a pairing i'd like to see done more. Personally, i think it's pretty sad...that there is a scarce number of K/R fics around.(I can count all of the K/R fics i have either read or heard about with my 10 fingers). This is not a very popular pairing in Eva fandom in spite of the great possibilities this pairing has...  
Ps: 丽/薰？这样的配对我很希望能看到更多。个人觉得挺遗憾的...因为丽/薰的同人文数量稀少（我能用十根手指头数完所有读过或听说过的丽/薰同人文）。尽管这对组合有着巨大的潜力，但在 EVA 同人圈里并不算热门...  
  
Anybody who has seen the "DC" version of evangelion will know that Kaworu a.k.a. Tabris was created by Seele using the same process that was used to create Rei...What's more, like Rei...they also gave him an angels soul, mainly Adam's salvageable soul.  
看过“DC”版 EVA 的人都知道，薰（即塔布里斯）是由 Seele 用制造丽的相同方法创造出来的...更重要的是，和丽一样...他们也赋予了他一个天使的灵魂，主要是亚当可回收的灵魂。  
  
Which means that Kaworu(Adam) is practically Rei's(Lilith) counterpart. What's more...if he can make the series second most introverted person to open up...imagine how long he'll take with the first child..._  
这意味着薰（亚当）实际上是丽（莉莉丝）的对应体。而且...如果他能打开系列中第二内向的人的心扉...想象一下他对第一适格者会有多长时间的影响..._
