In her thirteenth year of life Asuka Langley Soryu found herself in the unwelcome state of being in love with Shinji Ikari.  
在她十三岁那年，惣流·明日香·兰格雷发现自己陷入了一个不受欢迎的状态——爱上了碇真嗣。

She fought it, as she fought all egregious affronts to her naturally unparalleled greatness but she was inescapably doomed to this sorry reality. She refused to call it fate. Fate implied some higher power directing events towards a desired outcome. How any kind of power could desire this outcome would only convince Asuka there was no God and mankind lived in a hellish vacuum without any hope of ever finding peace or salvation. Though rotting in the ground for all eternity might be preferable to her current sorry state.  
她抗拒着，正如她抗拒所有对她天生无与伦比伟大的严重冒犯，但她不可避免地注定要面对这个可悲的现实。她拒绝称之为命运。命运意味着某种更高力量引导事件走向期望的结果。任何力量若能期望这样的结果，只会让明日香确信没有上帝，人类生活在一个地狱般的真空中，永远找不到和平或救赎的希望。尽管永远腐烂在地下可能比她目前的悲惨境遇更可取。

She already had a love/hate relationship with God, in that God loved to hate her. The feeling was mutual. But this was beyond hate. This was some kind of sick sadism humans were incapable of comprehending. She watched all her dreams and aspirations die a slow, grisly death at the beautiful, perfect hands of Shinji Ikari.  
她与上帝早已建立了爱恨交织的关系，上帝喜欢恨她，这种感觉是相互的。但这超越了恨，这是一种人类无法理解的病态虐待狂。她眼睁睁看着自己所有的梦想和抱负在真嗣那双美丽完美的手中缓慢而残酷地死去。

_Stop that!_ Asuka screamed at herself. _Don't think about how soft and smooth they are, or what you want him to do with those long, slender fingers of his. None of that interests you at all!_  
住手！明日香对自己尖叫。别去想它们有多柔软光滑，也别去想你希望他用那修长的手指做什么。这些对你一点吸引力都没有！

His uninteresting flawlessly gorgeous hands were currently dancing through the air as he collected and combined ingredients in Home Ec class to magically create a succulent feast. Or stir-fry. Asuka wasn't picky. As long as it wasn't curry. Misato ruined that dish for her forever. Or anything with tofu. And God help him if he made miso soup one more time.  
他那双既平凡又完美无瑕的双手，此刻正在家政课上空中舞动，巧妙地收集并混合食材，仿佛施展魔法般烹制出一道道美味佳肴。或是炒菜。明日香并不挑剔。只要不是咖喱就行。美里让她对这道菜永远失去了兴趣。还有任何含有豆腐的菜肴。如果他再做一次味噌汤，上帝保佑他吧。

The universe, jealous of her incomparable beauty and natural superiority, had yet again petulantly decided to punish her. The teacher had paired her with Toji, citing their respective "need to improve social interaction and cooperation." They had cooperated thus far. Asuka punched him in the back of the head and he obligingly fell unconscious.  
宇宙似乎因嫉妒她无与伦比的美貌和天生的优越感，又一次任性地决定惩罚她。老师以他们各自“需要提高社交互动与合作能力”为由，将她与冬二配对。到目前为止，他们已经合作了。明日香一拳打在他的后脑勺上，他便顺从地昏了过去。

With that distraction out of the way, she settled in to not work and keep an eye on Shinji. God only knew what he'd foul up if she wasn't constantly watching his every seductive movement. Or who would foul him up.  
解决了这个干扰后，她安顿下来，不干活并盯着真嗣。只有上帝知道，如果她不时刻监视着他每一个诱人的动作，他会搞砸什么。或者谁会搞砸他。

He was partnered with Rei who, Asuka had to admit, needed all the help she could get with everything imaginable, but forcing Shinji to lower himself to her level was a crime. And considering Shinji was already on a ridiculously low level to begin with this was some horrifically abnormal lowering.  
他与丽搭档，对此，明日香不得不承认，丽在各方面都需要尽可能的帮助，但强迫真嗣降低到她的水平简直是一种罪行。考虑到真嗣原本就已经处于一个荒谬的低水平，这种降低简直是骇人听闻的异常。

He was helping Rei through the lesson with subtle direction and gentle encouragement, blushing like an idiot the whole time. The two seemed to inexplicably get along, and Asuka swore at the end she saw Rei crack a grotesque, barely-there smile as her nasty ashen cheeks turned a diseased pinkish hue.  
他正通过微妙的引导和温和的鼓励帮助丽完成课程，全程像个傻瓜一样脸红。两人似乎莫名其妙地相处融洽，明日香发誓在最后她看到丽露出了一个扭曲、几乎看不见的微笑，她那糟糕的灰白脸颊泛起了病态的粉红色。

Asuka had been waiting for just the right excuse and now she had it. Such scandalous interaction could not be tolerated. It was time to kill one ugly, pasty, blue-haired bird with as many stones as possible.  
明日香一直在等待合适的借口，现在她找到了。这种丑闻般的互动绝不能容忍。是时候用尽可能多的石头砸死那只丑陋、苍白、蓝发的鸟了。

/\/\/\/\

The doorbell was broken. Figured. And there was no lock. Brilliant. It was like she was asking to be killed for her inept flirting with Shinji. Asuka swung Rei's apartment door open and was forcibly reminded about the girl's sanitary habits.  
门铃坏了。意料之中。而且连锁都没有。真是绝了。这简直就像她在因为对真嗣笨拙的调情而自寻死路。明日香猛地推开绫波的公寓门，立刻被提醒了这女孩的卫生习惯。

"Smells like someone took a bloody dump in here," she muttered, wondering if Misato had adopted the less compatible Children. A quick check in the bathroom confirmed that, no, Rei did not own deodorant. "How can Shinji stand to be near her? Did he lose his sense of smell?"  
“闻起来像是有人在这儿拉了血淋淋的一泡，”她嘀咕着，怀疑美里是不是收养了那些不兼容的孩子们。卫生间里的一番快速检查证实了，不，绫波并没有除臭剂。“真嗣怎么能忍受待在她身边？难道他失去了嗅觉？”

Shinji smelled divine, like a musky wet day after a rainstorm. The kind of musky wet scent that made her musky and wet.  
真嗣闻起来美妙极了，就像雨后湿润的泥土气息。那种湿润的香气让她也变得湿润起来。

_Don't think about that now,_ she told herself. _You've got deeds to commit._  
现在别想那些，她对自己说。你还有事情要做。

She managed to beat Rei home by fifteen minutes, which she spent devising ways to combat the pale girl without actually having to touch her. In the end she figured she'd have to at least get her hands dirty, figuratively and literally.  
她设法比丽提前十五分钟到家，这段时间她一直在想如何在不实际接触的情况下对付那个苍白的女孩。最终她认为至少得在比喻和字面上都弄脏自己的手。

The front door creaked open and Rei entered. To her credit, she didn't startle when Asuka pinned her against the wall in a chokehold.  
前门吱呀一声打开，丽走了进来。值得称赞的是，当明日香将她按在墙上进行锁喉时，她并没有惊慌。

"Welcome home, First." "欢迎回家，舰长。"

"Pilot Soryu," she said blandly. "Why are you in my apartment?"  
"碇司令，" 她平淡地说道，"你为什么在我的公寓里？"

"A little home renovation. I'm exterminating all the bitches infesting this hovel."  
"小小的家居改造。我在清除所有侵扰这陋室的婊子们。"

"Section-2 dealt with the stray dog problem in this complex weeks ago."  
"第二部分几周前就处理了这个社区的流浪狗问题。"

"… God, I hate you so, so much." Asuka applied pressure to Rei's throat. "You. I was talking about you. I'm going to exterminate you. Bitch."  
"……天啊，我真是恨透你了。" 明日香用力压在绫波的喉咙上。"你。我说的就是你。我要消灭你。贱人。"

"Ah. May I ask why?"  
"啊。我能问为什么吗？"

"Don't act like you don't know. I saw you today, flirting with Shinji. I won't stand for that collapse of morality."  
"别装作你不知道。我今天看到你和真嗣调情了。我不能容忍这种道德沦丧。"

"You misunderstand; I harbor no romantic intentions for Ikari."  
"你误会了；我对碇没有浪漫的意图。"

"You expect me to believe that, you pallid harlot?"  
"你以为我会相信吗，你这苍白的荡妇？"

"I have spent my entire life with one Ikari," Rei said with what for her passed as a fatigued sigh. "I am not eager to add a second."  
"我一生中只与一位碇相伴，" 绫波说，语气中透露出对她而言算是疲惫的叹息。"我不急于再添一个。"

"Then how do you explain all this?" Asuka gestured around the room, wallpapered with pictures of Shinji in various states of undress, along with numerous lewd sketches and big hearts with R+S Forever emblazoned inside.  
"那你怎么解释这一切？" 明日香指着房间四周，墙上贴满了各种状态下衣衫不整的真嗣的照片，还有许多猥亵的素描和写着 R+S Forever 的大心形图案。

"Artistic curiosity." "艺术好奇心罢了。"

"You are so dead." "你死定了。"

"Technically," Rei said, "you cannot kill me."  
"严格来说，""丽说，""你杀不了我。"

"The arm on your windpipe says otherwise," Asuka growled.  
"你脖子上的手臂可不这么认为，""明日香咆哮道。"

"No, I meant destroying this body will be fruitless." Rei then went on to explain the complex and lengthy cloning procedure that otherwise would fill several paragraphs.  
"不，我的意思是摧毁这个身体是徒劳的。" 丽接着解释了那个复杂且冗长的克隆过程，否则这会占据好几个段落。

"Huh," Asuka mused, "you really are replaceable, aren't you? Not a problem. I'll just seal you in one of these dilapidated apartments. By the time you die and get reincarnated or whatever, Shinji and I will be long gone and you'll never find us."  
"哼，" 明日香若有所思地说，"你真的可以被替代，不是吗？没关系。我会把你封在其中一个破旧的公寓里。等你死了，转世或者什么的，真嗣和我早就离开了，你永远找不到我们。

"You would take him to Germany."  
"你会带他去德国。

"How did you—? I mean, no." She tensed her arm. "Say goodnight, First."  
"你怎么——？我是说，不。" 她紧绷着胳膊。"说晚安，第一。"

"I'll go willingly," Rei stated, hoping to defuse the situation. "There is no need for violence."  
"我会自愿去的，" 丽说道，希望能缓和局势。"没有必要使用暴力。"

Asuka punched her in the back of the head. Her skull slammed into the wall, rendering her unconscious. Asuka gave her another punch for good measure.  
明日香一拳打在她的后脑勺上。她的头猛地撞在墙上，使她失去了意识。明日香又补了一拳，以确保她不会醒来。

"Pfft. No need for violence? Where's the fun in that?" She was about to drag Rei's limp body into a nearby apartment before remembering that would entail touching her again. She settled on kicking her across the floor, then vowing to burn the shoes later. "Gonna have to scrub my feet with steel wool, too. To get all the loser off me."  
"噗。不需要暴力？那有什么乐趣？" 她正要把丽那瘫软的身体拖进附近的一间公寓，却突然想起那意味着又要碰她。于是她改用脚把她踢过地板，然后发誓稍后要把鞋子烧掉。"还得用钢丝球搓脚，把所有失败者的痕迹都洗掉。"

But it was worth it to dispose of her greatest rival, on and off the battlefield. Which wasn't saying much. With her natural superiority Asuka had no true rivals, and Rei's sloppy attempts at opposition were poor distractions at best, but Shinji was easily distracted.  
但为了摆脱她最大的竞争对手，无论是在战场上还是生活中，这一切都是值得的。虽然这么说也没什么大不了的。凭借天生的优越感，明日香没有真正的对手，而丽那些拙劣的对抗充其量只是些微不足道的干扰，但真嗣很容易分心。

With Rei's pale, sickly influence removed he'd naturally refocus on the shining brilliance that was Asuka Langley Soryu. And after some drastic modifications to his behavior, appearance, attitude and basic nature, she might one day publically acknowledge him.  
随着丽那苍白病态的影响被消除，他自然会重新关注起明日香·兰格雷那耀眼的光芒。经过一些彻底的行为、外表、态度和基本性格的改造，她或许有一天会公开承认他。

/\/\/\/\

Asuka often wondered how, against all odds and common sense, Shinji somehow went from a sort of cute but repulsively infuriating coward to someone worthy of her attention. There were isolated incidents of awesome; manning up to help beat Israfel, jumping into that volcano to save her life, the time she walked in on him in the shower. All of the little, seemingly random positive aspects that infrequently crept through his normal dorky wimpiness stuck in her, building up beneath her radar like an undetected disease. Just when she was sure he was too cowardly and weak to ever pose a threat he metastasized into a malignant emotional tumor that tore her apart from the inside out until all that remained was a rotting shell of her former magnificence.  
明日香常常纳闷，究竟是怎样逆天改命、颠覆常理，使得真嗣从一个既可爱又令人恼火至极的懦夫，蜕变为值得她关注的人。那些零星的英勇瞬间；挺身而出协助击败伊斯拉斐尔，纵身跃入火山口救她性命，还有那次她无意间闯入他洗澡的场景。这些微小却看似随机的积极特质，偶尔穿透他平日里笨拙胆怯的外壳，悄然扎根于她心间，如同未被察觉的疾病般在雷达之下潜滋暗长。就在她确信他懦弱无能，永远构不成威胁时，他却突变成为一颗恶性的情感肿瘤，从内而外将她撕裂，直至她昔日辉煌仅剩下一具腐朽的空壳。

The only way she saw to regain her self-respect was to somehow transform Shinji into a useful human being, thereby possibly becoming worthy of her affection, or at the very least her tolerance. Until then public humiliation and beatings were obligatory. How her regimen of emotional and physical abuse had yet to produce results was a point of genuine confusion and only served to strengthen her conviction that such treatment was absolutely necessary.  
她认为恢复自尊的唯一途径，就是设法将真嗣变成一个有用的人，从而可能配得上她的爱慕，或至少得到她的宽容。在那之前，公开羞辱和殴打是必不可少的。她的情感和身体虐待计划为何至今未见成效，这让她感到真正的困惑，反而更加坚定了她认为这种对待绝对必要的信念。

Mostly because love had many unpleasant side effects. Aside from the manic emotional and sticky physical components Asuka was suddenly very conscious of how other women interacted with her Shinji. Because he was hers whether or not he realized it yet. Which he wouldn't. He was a bit dense. But that was sort of cute.  
主要是因为爱情有许多不愉快的副作用。除了情绪上的狂热和身体上的黏腻，明日香突然意识到其他女性是如何与她的真嗣互动的。因为他是她的，无论他是否意识到这一点。他不会意识到的。他有点迟钝。但这有点可爱。

_Stop that!_ Asuka screamed at herself. _Why are all of his many, many monumental failings as a human being suddenly less infuriating?_  
住手！明日香对自己尖叫。为什么他那么多、那么多的重大人性缺陷突然变得不那么令人愤怒了？

It reinforced her concern regarding the other females in his life. And there were so many females. None of them would be able to destroy and reshape Shinji into a proper man like she could. That took love. Human love.  
这加深了她对他在生活中其他女性的担忧。女性实在太多了。她们中没有一个能像她那样，将真嗣塑造成一个真正的男人。这需要爱。人类的爱。

So after observing Shinji fix a special dinner for Pen Pen and the bird's grateful leg hug for the meal, Asuka decided murder was the only rational option. She felt assured Shinji would resist any romantic overtures from the filthy perverted bird but it was in his nature to crumble and submit under any pressure. Yet another reason he needed her love. And only her love.  
因此，在看到真嗣为 Pen Pen 准备了一顿特别的晚餐，而那只鸟感激地用腿拥抱食物后，明日香决定谋杀是唯一合理的选项。她确信真嗣会抗拒那只肮脏变态鸟的任何浪漫示好，但他的本性是在任何压力下都会崩溃和屈服。这又是他需要她的爱的另一个原因。而且只有她的爱。

So it was with a sense of poetic justice that Asuka lured Pen Pen into a false sense of security with one of Shinji's meals, used a cleaver to knock him out, boiled him alive and chopped him into bite-sized chunks with the aforementioned meal prepared by Shinji and served him as dinner to her roommates.  
于是，明日香以一种诗意的正义感，用真嗣准备的一顿饭让 Pen Pen 放松了警惕，用菜刀将它击昏，活活煮沸，并将其切成一口大小的块，用真嗣准备的同一顿饭将其作为晚餐端给了她的室友们。

"This is really good," Shinji said, enthusiastic yet demure as he ate. "I'm very impressed."  
"这真的很棒，" 真嗣边吃边说，热情中带着几分羞涩。"我非常佩服。"

Asuka bit her tongue to stop from commenting on how he'd be very impressed by anything, including a rock served on a used napkin. It was part of his miserable charm.  
明日香咬住舌头，以免说出他会因为任何东西——哪怕是放在用过的餐巾纸上的石头——而感到非常佩服。这是他那可怜的魅力的一部分。

"This _is_ good," Misato agreed between mouthfuls. Asuka wondered if she should forgo traditional utensils in favor of a shovel. "Who knew you cooked? What's in it?"  
"这很好，" 美里边大口吃边同意道。明日香在想，她是否应该放弃传统餐具，改用铲子。"谁知道你会做饭？里面有什么？"

"Just something I found in the fridge," Asuka told them.  
"只是冰箱里找到的东西，" 明日香告诉他们。

/\/\/\/\

Following Pen Pen's mysterious disappearance Shinji's schedule freed up dramatically. Asuka never realized how much the bird demanded from him. And once he stopped whining about Pen Pen's mysterious disappearance he'd be able to spend more time with her. Asuka was wholly aware of how much time and effort was required to reshape Shinji, and made the noble sacrifice of accepting the staggering task in full.  
自从企鹅潘潘神秘失踪后，真嗣的时间突然变得充裕起来。明日香从未意识到这只鸟对真嗣的要求有多高。一旦他不再抱怨潘潘的神秘失踪，他就能花更多时间陪她了。明日香完全明白重塑真嗣需要多少时间和精力，她做出了高尚的牺牲，全盘接受了这一艰巨任务。

"We're going shopping," she informed him one afternoon as school was ending. The boy needed to expand his wardrobe to be presentable next to her. And if he happened to need help dressing because he was so dense, well, who was she to argue?  
"我们要去购物，" 一天下午放学时她告诉他。这男孩需要扩充他的衣橱，以便在她身边显得体面。如果他因为太迟钝而需要帮忙穿衣服，嗯，她又有什么理由拒绝呢？

Shinji looked pained. Asuka was about to give him a real reason for wearing such an expression but Toji rudely interrupted.  
真嗣看起来很痛苦。明日香正要给他一个真正的原因来解释这种表情，但这时东治粗鲁地打断了他们。

"He can't," the jock said. He nodded behind him to Kensuke. "We're going to the arcade. You got to let your husband have some fun now and then."  
“他不能，”这位运动员说。他点头示意身后的健介。“我们要去游戏厅。你得让你丈夫偶尔也放松一下。”

The blush that enveloped her face did a fine job of masking her sudden decision to kill Toji and Kensuke. With them out of the picture Shinji would have even more free time, and he'd be rid of their disgusting influence. Asuka saw no possible downside.  
她脸上泛起的红晕很好地掩盖了她突然决定要杀掉东治和健介的想法。如果他们不在了，真嗣会有更多的自由时间，也能摆脱他们那令人厌恶的影响。明日香看不到任何可能的缺点。

She also made note of everyone in class who was giggling at the "husband" comment, glaring at her in jealousy, and that one guy in the back making an obscene gesture with his hands.  
她还留意到班上那些因为“丈夫”一词而窃笑的同学，他们嫉妒地瞪着她，还有后排那个家伙用手做出下流的手势。

"I see," Asuka said placidly. Shinji cringed. "Then be sure to have a good time today. Treat it like it was your last day on earth."  
“我明白了，”明日香平静地说。真嗣缩了缩身子。“那么今天一定要玩得开心。就当这是你在地球上的最后一天。”

Which it was. 确实如此。

Shadowing them to the arcade was child's play. Separating Shinji from them and stuffing him in a bathroom stall was tougher, but not impossible for her brilliance. Waiting for a moment to strike was a matter of patience and timing.  
跟踪他们到游戏厅简直是小菜一碟。将真嗣从他们中分离出来并塞进洗手间隔间则更具挑战性，但对她来说并非不可能。等待时机出击则需要耐心和精准的时机把握。

The two boys were at a UFO catcher, trying to win a doll that looked suspiciously like Shinji as a girl. That only reinforced her commitment to murder.  
两个男孩正在玩抓娃娃机，试图赢得一个看起来可疑地像女装真嗣的玩偶。这更加坚定了她要下手的决心。

"Hey, idiots," she called out. "Look alive. For the next few moments."  
“嘿，蠢货们，”她喊道，“打起精神来。接下来的几分钟里。”

"Soryu?" Toji snorted, looking over his shoulder. "Come to make sure your hubby hasn't run off with someone hotter?"  
"惣流？" 冬二嗤笑一声，回头看了一眼。"来确认你老公没跟更火辣的人跑了吗？"

"That's impossible, for so many reasons."  
"那是不可能的，有太多理由了。"

"Get lost. He's actually having fun for once. We don't need you dropping in to ruin things."  
"滚开。他难得真正开心一次。我们不需要你来搅局。"

"Speaking of dropping…" Asuka kicked him so hard in the crotch Toji lifted a full foot off the ground. "This is for flashing me on the _Over the Rainbow_, pervert!" She grabbed his head as he fell. "And this is for contaminating my Shinji with your existence!" She slammed Toji's face through the UFO catcher's protective glass, then pushed down, slicing his throat open on a jagged shard.  
"说到掉落……" 明日香一脚狠狠踢中他的下体，使得真嗣整个人腾空一英尺。"这是为了你在彩虹之上对我耍流氓，变态！" 她在他倒下时抓住他的头。"还有这个，是为了你污染了我的真嗣！" 她将真嗣的脸猛地砸穿了抓娃娃机的保护玻璃，然后向下压，让他的喉咙在锋利的玻璃碎片上划开。

Kensuke watched in mute horror as his friend bled out over an assortment of colorful plushies.  
剑介惊恐地看着他的朋友在一堆色彩缤纷的毛绒玩具上流血不止。

"Hey," Asuka said to him, wiping a bloody hand on Toji's corpse, "remember when you said you wished a girl like me would order you around, just once? Well here's my order: _Die_."  
"嘿，" 明日香对他说，一边在真嗣的尸体上擦着血手，"记得你说过希望像我这样的女孩能命令你一次吗？好吧，这是我的命令：去死。"

She grabbed a doll from the open UFO catcher and rushed forward to knee Kensuke in the gut. He tried to scream and found his mouth full of adorable plushie.  
她从敞开的 UFO 抓娃娃机里抓起一个玩偶，冲上前去用膝盖猛击 Kensuke 的腹部。他试图尖叫，却发现嘴里塞满了可爱的毛绒玩具。

"Why, God?" he gave a muffled plea to the heavens.  
“为什么，上帝？”他向天空发出了一声闷闷的祈求。

"Because you're you," Asuka answered. She stuffed the doll down his throat.  
“因为你就是你，”明日香回答道。她把玩偶塞进了他的喉咙。

Rescuing Shinji from the bathroom was a fitting denouement; she had just saved him from the human excrement that was Toji and Kensuke.  
从浴室救出真嗣，这结局恰如其分；她刚刚把他从那堆人渣——东治和剑介中解救出来。

"Asuka!" he startled as she opened the door. "Thank goodness. Someone locked me in here and—"  
"明日香！" 他惊慌失措，当她打开门时。"谢天谢地。有人把我锁在这里，而且——"

"Shut up. Oh yeah, I conveniently bumped into Suzahara and Aida while you were in here. They said they never really liked you and that you shouldn't hang out with them or look for them anymore. Brutal, but at least they're honest. Dead honest."  
"闭嘴。哦对了，我正好碰见了铃原和相田，你在这儿的时候。他们说其实从来没真正喜欢过你，让你别再和他们混在一起，也别再找他们了。虽然残酷，但至少他们够坦诚。坦诚得要命。"

Shinji's lower lip trembled. "They never really liked me?"  
真嗣的下唇颤抖着。“他们从来就没真正喜欢过我吗？”

"Well, they never said they _did_ like you, did they?" Asuka rolled her eyes. "Oh, lord. Tell you what. Since you look so pathetic right now and are hopeless on your own, I'll tolerate you hanging around with me if I have nothing better to do."  
“好吧，他们从没说过喜欢你，不是吗？”明日香翻了个白眼。“哦，天哪。告诉你吧。既然你现在看起来这么可怜，又无助，如果我没别的事做，我会容忍你在我身边晃悠。”

"Th-Thank you, Asuka," he sniffled and gave her a shaky smile that ensured she'd need to change her underwear at some point in the near future.  
“谢、谢谢你，明日香。”他抽泣着，给了她一个颤抖的微笑，这让她在不久的将来某刻肯定得换条内裤。

_Man,_ she thought, _murder makes everything better._  
天啊，她想，谋杀让一切都好起来了。

With her two biggest, ugliest bases at school covered, Asuka's next task was to weed out competition at NERV.  
在学校里解决了她最大的两个丑闻后，明日香接下来的任务是在 NERV 中清除竞争对手。

/\/\/\/\

"Mr. Kaji, I'm a boy."  
“加治先生，我是男孩。”

"You sure are." “你确实如此。”

Asuka was reluctant to end the life of her first crush, but after overhearing that little conversation she was left with no alternative. She knew from firsthand observation how dangerous Kaji could be when he set his sights on a target. She was not aware his tastes ran such a wide gamut though she should have expected as much.  
明日香不愿结束她初恋的生命，但听到那段对话后，她别无选择。她亲眼见过当加持锁定目标时有多危险。虽然她并不知道他的口味如此广泛，但她本应预料到这一点。

After a quick trip to his office to steal his laptop and publish its contents on the web, Kaji simply vanished the next day.  
在快速前往他的办公室偷走他的笔记本电脑并将其内容发布到网上后，加持第二天就神秘消失了。

/\/\/\/\

"Ms. Misato, you're my guardian!"  
"美里小姐，你是我的监护人！"

"I'm also your commanding officer, and I'm in a very commanding mood. I hope you're in a submissive one."  
"我还是你的指挥官，现在我心情很‘指挥’。希望你心情很‘服从’。"

Asuka was not reluctant to end the life of her first crush's first love, but after overhearing that little drunken conversation she was happily left with no alternative. Drowning her sorrows following Pen Pen's unexpected disappearance and Kaji's fully expected one, Misato chose to abuse both her official position and her ward. Asuka waited until she literally threw Shinji into her room before smashing an empty liquor bottle over her head and rendering her unconscious. After soothingly ordering Shinji to let her take care of everything and just shut up and go to bed, she dragged Misato's sizable dead weight to the kitchen for a little girl talk.  
对于结束她第一个暗恋对象的初恋，明日香并不感到勉强，但那次酒后的小对话让她别无选择，只能欣然接受。在企鹅潘潘意外失踪和加持意料之中的离去后，美里选择用酒精来淹没自己的悲伤，滥用她的官方职位和监护权。明日香等到她真的把真嗣扔进房间后，用一个空酒瓶砸在她的头上，使她昏迷过去。安抚地命令真嗣让她来处理一切，只是闭嘴去睡觉，她拖着美里沉重的身体到厨房进行一次小小的女孩谈话。

One funnel and thirty-seven beers later Misato Katsuragi finally died.  
一个漏斗和三十七瓶啤酒下肚后，葛城美里终于离世了。

Shinji cried at the funeral, of course, but Asuka consoled him with a tender, heartfelt "Stop whining. Be a man." Gendo nodded approvingly, which sort of killed the moment.  
真嗣当然在葬礼上哭了，但明日香温柔而真挚地安慰他：“别再抱怨了。像个男人。”碇源堂赞许地点了点头，这多少破坏了气氛。

Misato's autopsy showed death by alcohol poisoning, which was universally accepted as a long overdue inevitability, despite the initial shock of her dying from too much booze. She died doing what she loved, Ritsuko said solemnly, and acceptance soon followed.  
美里的尸检结果显示死于酒精中毒，尽管最初大家对她是因饮酒过量而死感到震惊，但普遍认为这是迟早的事。正如律子严肃地说的那样，她死于自己热爱的事情，于是大家很快接受了这一事实。

/\/\/\/\

Serial killer was such a distasteful label. Asuka preferred to think she was an agent of romantic Darwinism. Only the strongest could survive being with Shinji and not go insane or commit suicide. Asuka was the strongest and best at everything, so naturally she won by default. Shinji was the weakest and worst at everything, including attention spans, so all possible distractions had to be weeded out. Or violently murdered. Such was the world they lived in.  
连环杀手这个标签真是令人反感。明日香更愿意认为自己是一名浪漫达尔文主义的代理人。只有最强者才能与真嗣在一起而不发疯或自杀。明日香是最强且最擅长一切的，所以她自然默认胜出。真嗣是最弱且最不擅长一切的，包括注意力集中，所以所有可能的干扰都必须被清除。或者被暴力杀害。这就是他们所处的世界。

Confident in her private rationalizations and continued freedom after several homicides, Asuka took a leisurely trip downtown to replace her increasingly blood-splattered wardrobe when she passed by a young girl and flew into action on instinct.  
在几次谋杀后，明日香对自己的内心合理化充满信心，并继续享受自由，她悠闲地前往市中心更换她那日益血迹斑斑的衣橱，途中经过一个年轻女孩时，本能地采取了行动。

She tripped the girl, smashed her face into the sidewalk and dragged her into an alley before anyone noticed.  
她绊倒了那个女孩，将她的脸猛砸在人行道上，并在任何人注意到之前将她拖进了一条小巷。

"Who are you?" Asuka demanded, pinning her up against the wall.  
"你是谁？" 明日香厉声质问，将她按在墙上。

"Ma-Mana Kirishima," the girl managed to get out.  
"真-真波红巴，" 女孩勉强挤出话来。

"Wrong. You're dead." "错了。你已经死了。"

One grisly, barehanded murder later, Asuka emerged from the alley cleaning the blood off her with the tattered remains of Mana's school uniform.  
一场血腥的徒手谋杀后，明日香从巷子里走出，用玛娜破烂的校服残片擦拭着身上的血迹。

_I… don't know what came over me. I just knew it would be a bad idea to let her live and possibly meet Shinji._ She shrugged and smiled again. _One less thing to worry about._  
我……不知道自己怎么了。我只知道让她活着并可能遇到真嗣是个糟糕的主意。她耸了耸肩，再次微笑。少了一件需要担心的事。

/\/\/\/\

The next day after school Asuka again planned Shinji's day, since she always knew what was best for him.  
第二天放学后，明日香再次为真嗣规划了一天，因为她总是知道什么对他最好。

"We're hitting the shopping arcade," she politely ordered. "I'm tired of showing off how flawlessly gorgeous I am in the clothes I own. I require a new wardrobe." That, and the blood-splattering mentioned before. "Oh, and you're paying." She glanced over and sighed at the sniveling mess she was forced to love. "It's been two days. You need to get over Misato's unassisted death."  
"我们去购物中心吧，"她礼貌地命令道。"我已经厌倦了展示我现有衣服下完美无瑕的美丽。我需要新衣橱。"还有之前提到的血溅场面。"哦，对了，你来付钱。"她瞥了一眼，对着这个她不得不爱的懦弱家伙叹了口气。"已经两天了。你需要克服美里独自离世的事实。"

Shinji stifled another sob and regained composure, which for Shinji was simply not breaking down into hysterical tears. "I-I can't go shopping. Ms. Ritsuko scheduled a physical for me today. I was supposed to go on Tuesday but… but… Ms. Mi-Mi-Mi-Misato was—"  
真嗣强忍住又一阵哭泣，恢复了镇定，对真嗣来说，这仅仅意味着没有崩溃成歇斯底里的泪水。"我-我不能去购物。律子小姐今天给我安排了体检。我原本应该在星期二去的，但是…但是…美里小姐她—"

"Wait," Asuka ordered, delaying the imminent deluge of tears. "Akagi is your primary physician?" Asuka gracefully ignored how obvious that was. "How many physicals has she given you?"  
"等等，"明日香命令道，阻止了即将涌出的泪水。"赤木律子是你的主治医生？"明日香优雅地忽略了这一点有多明显。"她给你做了多少次体检？"

"I… I don't know. I lost count. A lot. I mean, I'm a pilot. Don't you have to go through them too?"  
"我……我不知道。我数不清了。很多。我是说，我是个飞行员。你们不也得经历这些吗？"

Like she'd let some perverted doctor look at her unclothed perfection. As far as Asuka was concerned the entire medical profession was inherently perverted.  
像她会让某个变态医生看她一丝不挂的完美身材似的。在明日香看来，整个医疗行业本质上就是变态的。

"'A lot'?" she repeated. "Like, more than none?"  
"“很多”？她重复道。“比如说，不止一个？”"

"… um, yeah…?" "… 呃，是啊…？"

_That blonde hag has seen my Shinji naked?_ she thought in a rage. _And more than once?_ _Unacceptable! This outrage demands murder._ If this wasn't a case for justifiable homicide Asuka didn't know what was.  
那个金发老巫婆见过我的真嗣裸体？她愤怒地想。还不止一次？绝对不能接受！这种侮辱必须以死相报。如果这都不算正当防卫杀人，那明日香不知道还有什么算。

"Go home," she told him.  
"回家去吧，" 她对他说。

"But—" "但——"

"Go home and get dinner started. I assure you your appointment will be canceled." She saw him hesitating and cracked a few knuckles. "_I assure you._"  
"回家准备晚饭吧。我保证你的预约会被取消。" 她看到他犹豫不决，便活动了几下手指关节。"我保证。"

Shinji thusly assured, Asuka checked her watch and sprinted to the nearest tramline into the Geofront. Once inside NERV proper it was a simple task to find Dr. Akagi. Asuka had memorized the schedules of NERV's upper echelon, initially for brownnosing opportunities but now for reasons relating less to kissing ass and more to kicking ass.  
得到这样的保证后，明日香看了看手表，然后飞奔到最近的电车线路前往地底都市。一进入 NERV 总部，找到赤木律子博士对她来说就是小菜一碟。明日香早已将 NERV 高层的日程表烂熟于心，起初是为了拍马屁的机会，但现在更多的是为了踢人屁股。

She found Ritsuko on the command deck, taking her daily Irish coffee break. The deck was empty, Ritsuko waiting for the afternoon shift change before "tempting the Katsuragi," as drinking was known among the crew. She raised her mug, smiling sadly.  
她在指挥甲板上找到了律子，正享受着每日的 Irish coffee 小憩。甲板上空无一人，律子等待着下午换班前“挑战葛城”，这是船员们对饮酒的戏称。她举起杯子，苦涩地笑了笑。

"This is for you, Misato." She took a sip. "But mostly me."  
“这杯敬你，美里。”她抿了一口。“但主要是为了我自己。”

"Good afternoon, Doctor," Asuka greeted, holding her hands behind her back.  
“下午好，博士，”明日香问候道，双手背在身后。

"Asuka!" Ritsuko startled, coughing to discreetly check her breath. "What are you doing here?"  
“明日香！”律子吓了一跳，轻咳一声以掩饰口气。“你在这里做什么？”

"Looking for you, actually. I wanted to talk to you about…" She trailed off, peering over the edge of the command deck. "Wow! That sure is a long drop, isn't it? I doubt anyone could survive a fall from this height. And there's no railing, either. You wouldn't even have to be pushed or anything. One little slip and it would be over. You'd be nothing but a bloody smudge on the floor. The floor waaaaaaay down there. But it _would_ be real easy for, oh say, me to push, oh say, you for, oh say, violating Shinji with your eyes each and every chance you had the urge to conduct one of your little 'checkups' on him."  
“其实是在找你。我有话想跟你谈谈……”她话音渐弱，目光越过指挥甲板的边缘。“哇！这可真是个长长的坠落，不是吗？我怀疑有人能从这么高的地方摔下去还能活命。而且连栏杆都没有。你甚至不需要被推什么的。只要轻轻一滑，一切就结束了。你会变成地板上的一滩血迹。地板在很远很远的地方。但对我来说，比如说，推你一把，比如说，因为你每次有机会就用眼睛侵犯真嗣，进行你那些小小的‘检查’，实在是太容易了。”

Ritsuko backed up a few steps.  
律子后退了几步。

Asuka suddenly brightened with a sweet smile. "But I'd never push you over this ledge for something like that." She laughed, gently urging Ritsuko to join in, which she did nervously until Asuka stopped dead and her expression darkened. "Pushing you would be too easy." She rushed forward and plunged a knife into her gut. "I want to _feel_ the life drain from your old, ugly, bleached sack of a body."  
明日香突然露出了一个甜美的微笑。“但我绝不会因为这种事就把你推下悬崖。”她笑着，温柔地催促律子一起笑，律子紧张地跟着笑了起来，直到明日香突然停住，表情变得阴沉。“推你下去太简单了。”她冲上前去，将一把刀刺入她的腹部。“我要感受你那衰老、丑陋、漂白过的躯壳中的生命逐渐流逝。”

Sixty-two stabs later, one for each year Asuka imagined Ritsuko had lived, the Doctor was on her back choking on blood, wondering how it came to this. Her life ended not for her many, many crimes against humanity, but for her mostly professional treatment of a patient.  
六十二刀之后，每一刀都代表着明日香想象中律子活过的每一年，博士躺在地上，血呛在喉咙里，不知道事情怎么会变成这样。她的生命没有因为对人类犯下的无数罪行而终结，而是因为她对一个病人基本专业的治疗。

Asuka loomed over her, arms and dress soaked in blood. "Make peace with whatever profane god you suck up to because you will be dead very soon. And the last thing you see will be this knife as it carves out your retinas to reclaim all the images you stole of my Shinji."  
明日香俯视着她，双臂和裙子浸满了鲜血。“与你所崇拜的任何亵渎神明和解吧，因为你很快就会死去。而你最后看到的，将是这把刀挖出你的视网膜，夺回你从我这里偷走的关于真嗣的所有影像。”

Ritsuko's last thought was how well Asuka and Yui would have gotten along.  
律子的最后一个念头是，如果明日香和唯在一起，她们一定会相处得非常好。

/\/\/\/\

The murder investigation was making very little progress. Asuka wasn't worried, confident in her natural inability to lose in anything, whether it was a video game or escaping homicide charges. She did detect a subtle sense of relief from the Commander following Ritsuko's death, which was a downside, but worth the cost.  
谋杀案调查进展甚微。明日香并不担心，她对自己在任何事情上都不会输的自然能力充满信心，无论是电子游戏还是逃避谋杀指控。她确实察觉到指挥官在律子死后有一种微妙的解脱感，这是一个缺点，但代价是值得的。

After yet another brilliantly successful synch test Asuka strolled the halls of NERV looking for Shinji, aiming to comfort and/or belittle him for being so sensitive over the recent rash of deaths. She found him in the lounge, quietly weeping on a bench, covering his face to hide his weakness.  
又一次极其成功的同步测试后，明日香在 NERV 的走廊里闲逛，寻找真嗣，打算安慰他或嘲笑他因为最近的死亡事件而如此敏感。她在休息室里找到了他，他正静静地坐在长椅上哭泣，用手遮住脸以掩饰自己的脆弱。

_Crybaby,_ she thought as she approached him. _The things I have to put up with for love._  
爱哭鬼，她想着走向他。为了爱情，我得忍受这些。

It wasn't until she was directly before him, ordering him to toughen up, when she realized it wasn't Shinji, but Maya. Asuka threw up a little in her mouth.  
直到她直接站在他面前，命令他坚强起来时，她才意识到那不是真嗣，而是玛雅。明日香差点吐了出来。

_S-She looked just like him from the back. I cannot make that mistake again.  
她从背后看简直和他一模一样。我不能再犯这种错误了。_

She had tackled Maya to the ground and was choking her before she realized it.  
她还没意识到，就已经把真希按倒在地，正掐着她的脖子。

"Shh, shh," Asuka soothed. "Don't cry. You'll be with your precious senpai soon. I should probably tell you: I was the last thing she saw too. Because I killed her. Oh, don't give me that look. Stop struggling. God, _fine_. How about this. I'll tell you your senpai's last words. Would that make you feel better about being choked to death? They were 'achk, urggh, khaaaaahh' because it was just after I shoved her eyeballs down her throat."  
"嘘，嘘，" 明日香安抚道，"别哭。你很快就能和你亲爱的学长在一起了。我应该告诉你：她最后看到的人也是我。因为我杀了她。哦，别那样看我。别挣扎了。天啊，好吧。这样如何。我会告诉你你学长的临终遗言。这样你会不会觉得被掐死好受些？她的遗言是'啊，呃，咳咳咳'，因为就在我刚把她的眼珠子塞进她喉咙之后。"

"Senpai," Maya tried to say, but could not summon the necessary strength or air. A moment later her heart stopped and she died.  
"学长，" 真希试图说出口，却无法聚集必要的力气或气息。片刻后，她的心脏停止了跳动，她死了。

"Phew!" Asuka said cheerily, wiping away a few stray beads of sweat. "Now what to do with this body." She noticed the garbage incinerator near the vending machines. Now she could dispose of the corpse and grab a nourishing post-murder snack.  
"“呼！”明日香欢快地说着，擦去几颗零星的汗珠。“现在该怎么处理这具身体呢。”她注意到自动贩卖机旁的垃圾焚化炉。现在她可以处理掉尸体，再买些营养的杀人后小吃。”

She was halfway through stomping Maya down the garbage chute when Shigeru and Makoto entered the lounge, hoping to score some emotionally unstable Ibuki action. Everyone froze.  
"她正把真矢踩进垃圾滑槽一半时，四郎和诚进入了休息室，希望能看到情绪不稳定的伊吹的戏码。所有人都僵住了。”

_Damn,_ Asuka thought. _Shouldn't have had the snack first._  
"该死，明日香心想。不该先吃小吃的。”

She casually waved. "Hey there, guys."  
她随意地挥了挥手。“嘿，大家好。”

"What did you—" “你做了什么——”

Shigeru was too slow to stop the heel that crushed his windpipe. Makoto managed to wet himself before receiving the punch that smashed his nose into his skull, shredding his brain with splintered bone and cartilage.  
茂在阻止那只碾碎他气管的鞋跟时动作太慢了。诚在遭到那一拳将他的鼻子砸进头骨之前，勉强尿了出来，碎骨和软骨撕裂了他的大脑。

The incinerators had their fill of meat that day. Asuka had her fill of vending machine snacks.  
那天，焚化炉吞噬了足够的肉块。而明日香也吃够了自动贩卖机的零食。

/\/\/\/\

The deaths of his three top technicians finally forced Gendo to hold some kind of meeting regarding the recent downsizing of his staff. Asuka tuned most of it out after he paid tribute to "the three young men who sacrificed their lives for NERV." She took an uneasy interest when the Commander turned his attention on Shinji as the meeting was breaking up.  
他三位顶尖技术人员的死亡终于迫使源渡召开了一次关于近期人员缩减的会议。明日香在他对“为 NERV 献身的三位年轻男子”表示敬意后，大部分内容都没再听进去。当指挥官在会议即将结束时转向真嗣时，她不安地产生了兴趣。

"Shinji," Gendo said, which was cause enough for alarm, "I have lost so much these past few days, and I still don't know where Rei is. It's made me realize all I have left is you… son."  
“真嗣，”源渡说道，这本身就足以引起警觉，“过去几天我失去了太多，至今仍不知丽在哪里。这让我意识到，我剩下的只有你了……儿子。”

Shinji's face lit up in the most euphoric smile Asuka ever saw. Gendo smiled too, but in an I-can't-believe-I-just-pulled-that-off kind of way.  
真嗣的脸上绽放出明日香从未见过的最狂喜的笑容。源渡也笑了，但那是一种难以置信自己居然成功了的表情。

Asuka also smiled. 明日香也露出了微笑。

Feeling good about thrusting more pressure and responsibility onto his moronic son, Gendo retired to his office to plan more nefariousness. If this was all it took to ensure Shinji's cooperation he should have acted desperate from the get-go instead of being all badass and awesomely cool.  
源渡对自己将更多压力和责任推给那个愚蠢的儿子感到满意，于是回到办公室策划更多的阴谋。如果这一切只需要表现出绝望就能确保真嗣的合作，他早该从一开始就装作走投无路，而不是一直摆出那种酷炫霸气的样子。

But as he opened his office door his plans hit a tiny snag. Fuyutsuki lay on the floor sprawled in a death throe, face frozen in a look of sheer terror.  
但当他打开办公室门时，计划遇到了一个小障碍。冬月躺在地上，四肢摊开，仿佛在死亡的痉挛中，脸上凝固着纯粹的恐惧。

"This does not bode well," Gendo said. A moment later he heard the soft pop of a silencer and felt a bullet shatter his left kneecap. His legs buckled and he collapsed.  
“这可不是好兆头，”碇源堂说。片刻后，他听到了消音器轻微的爆破声，感到一颗子弹击碎了他的左膝盖骨。他的双腿一软，倒在了地上。

"Wow," Asuka said, crawling out from under his desk. She idly twirled Gendo's office pistol on her finger. "You didn't cry out or anything. I'm almost impressed." She cocked the gun. "I have to admit your little gambit to make Shinji an obedient lapdog had merit, but you failed to calculate for my willingness to slaughter you like a pig. And granted, I wanted to savor this for a week or two of vicious torture and genital mutilation, you are the root cause of my Shinji's many, many failings, but I've got stuff to do. We'll have to make this quick."  
“哇，”明日香从他的桌子底下爬出来，懒洋洋地用手指旋转着碇源堂办公室里的手枪。“你居然没叫出声来。我差点就佩服你了。”她扳起枪机。“我得承认，你想把真嗣变成听话的小狗的计划有点意思，但你没算到我愿意像宰猪一样宰了你。当然，我本想享受一两周的残酷折磨和生殖器切除，毕竟你是真嗣诸多失败的根本原因，但我还有事要做。我们得速战速决。”

"Y-You killed Fuyutsuki," Gendo coughed out, trying to buy time.  
"你杀了冬月，" 碇源堂咳着说，试图拖延时间。

"Well, I was _going_ to. I jumped out from behind the desk to surprise him and he had a heart attack or something. Pretty pathetic."  
"本来是的。我从桌子后面跳出来想吓他一跳，结果他心脏病发作还是怎么的。真是可悲。

"Shinji won't forgive you for this."  
"真嗣不会原谅你的。

Asuka was still laughing five minutes later. "Are you kidding?" she finally managed, holding her sides. "He'll be upset, but only because he didn't get to finish you off himself. I'll make it up to him."  
五分钟后，Asuka 还在笑个不停。“你在开玩笑吧？”她终于喘过气来，捂着肚子说，“他会不高兴的，但只是因为他没能亲自解决你。我会补偿他的。”

She leveled the gun at his face and unloaded both the clip and Gendo's brains all over the floor.  
她把枪对准他的脸，将弹匣里的子弹和 Gendo 的脑浆一起射得满地都是。

/\/\/\/\

Hikari wasn't sure why Asuka insisted she wear a red wig and wander aimlessly around town for hours at a time but she knew better than to ask questions. She also wasn't sure why Asuka donned a hat and dark sunglasses during these same periods, but again, Hikari was at peace with the inequity in their friendship. Mostly because she saw how Asuka treated her enemies, real and perceived. No less than twenty-nine girls were forced to move out of the city after a concentrated campaign of rumors and outright threats. Sixteen more simply disappeared.  
Hikari 不明白为什么 Asuka 坚持让她戴上红色假发，在镇上漫无目的地游荡几个小时，但她知道最好不要多问。她也不清楚为什么 Asuka 在这些时候会戴上帽子和深色太阳镜，但 Hikari 对她们友谊中的这种不平等已经习以为常。主要是因为她见识过 Asuka 如何对待她的敌人，无论是真实的还是臆想的。不少于二十九个女孩在一场集中散布谣言和直接威胁的行动后被迫搬离了这座城市。还有十六个则直接消失了。

The male population had been literally halved.  
男性人口实际上减少了一半。

So when she received a call from Asuka to meet in an isolated public restroom on the shady side of town, she hurried over despite any personal misgivings. She was about to comment on the blood on her clothes but decided against it.  
所以当她接到明日香在城市阴暗角落的一个偏僻公共厕所见面的电话时，尽管内心有所顾虑，她还是急忙赶了过去。她本想评论她衣服上的血迹，但还是决定不说。

The girls shed their respective disguises and crawled out the window into an adjoining alley. Back in blood-free clothes, Asuka stretched contentedly. Hikari had to ruin the moment with inane worries.  
女孩们脱下各自的伪装，从窗户爬进相邻的小巷。换回没有血迹的衣服后，明日香满意地伸展身体。光却非要在这个时候用无聊的担忧破坏气氛。

"Are you sure we won't get into trouble doing, um, whatever it is we're doing?"  
"你确定我们这么做不会惹上麻烦吗，呃，不管我们到底在做什么？"

"Even those perverts from Section 2 don't watch me _every_ second," Asuka said. "And what did I tell you about questioning my orders?"  
"就连第二分部的那些变态也不会每时每刻盯着我，" 明日香说。"还有，我告诉过你多少次了，不要质疑我的命令？"

"Sorry," Hikari immediately squeaked.  
"对不起，" 光立刻小声说道。"

"I'll let it slide this time. Now update me on what that moron Shinji has been doing while I was off securing our futures."  
"这次我就放过你。现在告诉我，那个白痴真嗣在我去确保我们未来的时候都在干什么？"

She secretly found it cute how protective her friend was of Shinji, and wished she'd just go out with him. To voice such an opinion would be tantamount to suicide though. More than she knew. "Oh, um, not much. I'm… surprised he hasn't noticed I'm not you—"  
她暗自觉得朋友对真嗣的保护欲很可爱，希望她能直接和他交往。但说出这样的意见无异于自杀。她比谁都清楚这一点。“哦，呃，没什么特别的。我……惊讶他还没发现我不是你——”

"Well, I am much prettier and better at everything. But he's an idiot."  
“嗯，我确实漂亮得多，样样都比他强。但他就是个傻瓜。”

"R-Right," Hikari said, weeping internally. "Anyway, he's been sticking to the schedule you gave me. He cooks and cleans for me, er, I mean you, irons your clothes, does your homework and gives great foot massages. And he does it all without complaining, and the littlest compliment makes him so happy. He is so sweet," Hikari said in a slightly pitying manner, though appreciative and purely platonic.  
"“好——好的，”光说，内心却在哭泣。“无论如何，他一直按照你给我的日程表行事。他为我，呃，我是说为你，做饭打扫，熨衣服，做作业，还提供很棒的足底按摩。而且他从不抱怨，哪怕是最小的夸奖都能让他非常开心。他真是太贴心了，”光带着一丝怜悯的语气说道，尽管感激且纯粹是柏拉图式的。

The universe screeched to a halt and Hikari felt the prickly fingers of death slide around her throat as Asuka turned on her with a dull gleam in her eyes.  
"宇宙仿佛戛然而止，光感到死神的刺痒手指环绕在她的脖子上，因为明日香用她眼中黯淡的光芒转向了她。

_Oh dear God she's going to kill me._ She did her best not to soil herself. A class representative had to observe a certain level of decorum.  
"哦，天哪，她要杀了我。她尽力不让自己失态。作为班代表，必须保持一定的礼仪。

_Well, I'm going to have to kill her._ Asuka sighed helplessly, and swiftly snapped her neck. Watching Hikari's lifeless body crumple to the ground she felt her only friend at the very least deserved a quick death.  
唉，我不得不杀了她。明日香无奈地叹息，迅速扭断了她的脖子。看着光那毫无生气的身体瘫倒在地，她觉得至少自己的唯一朋友应该得到一个痛快的死亡。

/\/\/\/\

The afternoon sun just began slipping behind the hills bordering Tokyo-3 and Asuka and Shinji walked through the deserted streets on their way home after Hikari's funeral. Shinji found her in high spirits despite that. It worried him a little.  
午后阳光刚刚开始滑落在东京-3 边缘的山丘后，明日香和真嗣走在空无一人的街道上，他们刚参加完光的葬礼回家。尽管如此，真嗣发现明日香心情异常高昂，这让他有些担忧。

"You know, this recent string of horrific unsolved murders got me thinking," he began, pausing for the inevitable insult about him using his brain. He was pleasantly surprised when none came. "Well, I felt guilty when my father died, but only because I didn't feel sad. But when I was the only one who showed up for the funeral, and I mean the only one, I had to bury him and perform the service by myself, it made me realize I don't want to end up like he did. Not the whole brutally murdered part, though that did look unpleasant, but winding up alone. Our lives could end at any time from Angels or inventive serial killers. So I decided even if I get hurt, it's better than living like my father. And since I decided that I, well, it's kind of embarrassing, but I realized…" He turned to Asuka and smiled gently. "… I'm in love."  
"你知道吗，最近这一连串可怕的未解谋杀案让我开始思考，"他开口说道，停顿了一下等待那句关于他动脑子的必然嘲讽。然而意外的是，并没有人出言讥讽。"嗯，我父亲去世时我感到内疚，但仅仅是因为我没有感到悲伤。但当我成为唯一出席葬礼的人，我是说唯一的一个，我不得不亲自埋葬他并独自完成葬礼仪式，那一刻我意识到我不想像他那样结束一生。不是说他被残忍杀害的那部分，虽然那确实看起来很不愉快，而是孤独终老。我们的生命随时可能因为天使或创意十足的连环杀手而终结。所以我决定，即使我会受伤，也好过像我父亲那样活着。而且自从我做出这个决定后，呃，有点尴尬，但我意识到……"他转向明日香，温柔地笑了。"……我恋爱了。"

Asuka stumbled. _Down, girl! Play it cool! You didn't commit all that murder just to blow your advantage now. Even if that smile just completely destroyed your underwear's saturation tolerance._ She collected herself and regained a steady, casual stride. "So who's the recipient of this happy little revelation?"  
明日香踉跄了一下。稳住，姑娘！保持冷静！你可不是为了现在搞砸自己的优势才犯下那些谋杀的。即便那个笑容刚刚彻底摧毁了你内衣的饱和承受力。她收拾好情绪，恢复了平稳随意的步伐。"那么，这个幸福小秘密的接收者是谁呢？"

"Someone brilliant, beautiful, strong, passionate and unique, with exotic features and an uncanny natural talent for everything they try. I could never be jealous, only awed. I know I'm not worthy but I'll try my hardest to somehow give proper recognition to the perfection of my love."  
"某人聪慧、美丽、坚强、热情且独一无二，拥有异域风情的外貌和尝试任何事物都无与伦比的天赋。我绝不会嫉妒，只有敬畏。我知道自己不配，但我会尽最大努力，以某种方式给予我爱人完美应有的认可。"

Asuka failed to contain the prideful grin that spread over her face. She liked how he thought. It was about time he realized the basic facts of life.  
明日香没能抑制住脸上骄傲的笑容。她喜欢他的这种想法。他终于意识到了生活的基本事实。

"I've never been in love before," Shinji went on, "but I know this has to be it. I could never be with anyone else." His features suddenly brightened as he looked down the street. "Ah! And there he is now!"  
"我从未恋爱过，" 真嗣继续说道，"但我知道这一定是爱情。我再也无法与其他人在一起了。" 他的表情突然一亮，望向街道。"啊！他现在就在那里！"

"'_He?'"_ she repeated. “‘他？’”她重复道。

Ahead of them, approaching at a leisurely, confident gait was a tall young man with pale skin and silvery hair. In the fading light his red eyes were clearly visible.  
在他们前方，一个高个子的年轻男子正以一种悠闲而自信的步伐走来，他皮肤苍白，头发银白。在渐暗的光线下，他那双红色的眼睛清晰可见。

"You're _gay?_" Asuka cried.  
“你是同性恋？”明日香惊呼道。

"I thought it was obvious," Shinji said with a shrug. He then hurried forward to meet his beloved.  
"我以为这很明显，" 真嗣耸了耸肩说。随后他快步向前，去迎接他心爱的人。

"Then all that murder was for nothing!"  
"那这一切杀戮岂不是白费了！"

The two boys embraced and Asuka successfully staved off vomiting all over the sidewalk. The insane sociopathic rampage of death and destruction she waged against her coworkers and only friend in the world threatened to crush a sorely neglected conscience until she remembered they all had it coming. No use crying over spilt milk. In fact, she probably did them a favor. What were they contributing to society? If anything, they were getting in the way of the rest of the world recognizing how awesome she was. And all that was in the past anyway.  
两个男孩紧紧相拥，而明日香成功地忍住了在人行道上呕吐的冲动。她对同事和世界上唯一的朋友发起的那场疯狂的反社会暴力行为，原本几乎要压垮她那被严重忽视的良心，直到她想起他们都是咎由自取。覆水难收，实际上，她可能还帮了他们一个忙。他们对社会有什么贡献呢？如果有的话，他们只是在阻碍世界认识到她有多么了不起。而且，这一切都已成为过去。

"This is Kaworu Nagisa," Shinji gushed, bringing him back to his roommate. "He just transferred here. And he's _older_." He turned and smiled up at the other boy. "Isn't he great?"  
"这是渚薰，" 真嗣兴奋地说，将他带回到室友面前。"他刚转学过来。而且他年纪比我们大。" 他转头对着另一个男孩微笑。"他是不是很棒？"

"The pleasure is mine," Kaworu said breezily.  
"很高兴认识你，" 渚薰轻松地说道。

"Charmed," Asuka responded, using the pretense of a low curtsey to heft a sizable rock from the ground. In a flash she leapt and gracefully kicked Shinji in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. She used his body as a springboard and launched herself at Kaworu, pinning him to the ground.  
"荣幸之至，" 明日香回应道，借着低低的屈膝礼掩饰从地上举起一块大石头。她瞬间跃起，优雅地踢向真嗣的后脑勺，将他击昏。她利用他的身体作为跳板，向渚薰扑去，将他按倒在地。

"I'm pleased to finally meet you," he said with the same calm affability. "Shinji speaks often about y—"  
"很高兴终于见到你了，"他带着同样的平静和蔼说道，"真嗣经常提到你——"

The rock shattered his front teeth. The next strike crushed his nose. Then his left cheek. Then his right temple. Then his windpipe. Then his left eye burst.  
岩石击碎了他的前牙。下一击压碎了他的鼻子。接着是左脸颊。然后是右太阳穴。然后是气管。接着他的左眼爆裂了。

"Die die die die die die die die die die _die_ _die die die die die die DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!_"  
""死死死死死死死

Asuka sat back panting for breath. All that remained of Kaworu Nagisa's head was a lumpy red stew of brain pulp and bone fragment. The sidewalk was nearly purple with blood.  
明日香靠后坐下，喘着粗气。渚薰的头颅只剩下了一堆血肉模糊的脑浆和骨片。人行道上几乎被血染成了紫色。

After dousing the corpse with gasoline and her urine she lit it on fire and spent a relaxing sunset watching it burn to an unrecognizable husk. As Shinji began to stir she quickly dragged him away from the scene and called upon all the skills she honed using disguises to murder people.  
她往尸体上浇了汽油和自己尿液后点燃，悠闲地看着它在夕阳下烧成无法辨认的残骸。当真嗣开始苏醒时，她迅速将他拖离现场，并运用她通过伪装谋杀他人所磨练出的所有技巧。

/\/\/\/\

"What happened?" Shinji wondered aloud, regaining consciousness. "It felt like Asuka kicked me in the back of the head."  
“发生了什么？”真嗣恢复意识，自言自语道，“感觉像是被明日香踢了后脑勺。”

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

He looked up and found Kaworu standing over him, offering a pale hand up. Shinji blushed as he took it and was hauled to his feet.  
他抬头一看，发现渚薰正站在他面前，伸出一只苍白的手。真嗣脸一红，握住他的手，被拉了起来。

"Wasn't Asuka here a minute ago?" he asked, getting his bearings as he gently touched the massive bleeding lump on the back of his head.  
“刚才不是明日香在这里吗？”他一边调整姿势，一边轻轻触碰后脑勺上巨大的流血肿块，问道。

"No; you must be imagining things," Asuka responded, incognito as Kaowru, lowering her voice only slightly to imitate that effeminate bitch.  
"不，你一定是想象出来的，" 明日香化名 Kaowru 回应道，只是稍微压低了声音模仿那个娘娘腔的婊子。

Shinji loved the beautiful and perfect Kaworu and had no reason not to believe an obvious lie. "Oh. Then I must have imagined it." He looked at the sky. "Wow. It's already so late. S-So, are we still on for tonight?" he asked with a bright blush.  
真嗣深爱着美丽完美的渚薰，没有理由不相信一个明显的谎言。"哦，那我一定是想象出来的。" 他望向天空。"哇，已经这么晚了。那，我们今晚还去吗？" 他红着脸问道，显得有些兴奋。

"Of course. Ah, what are we doing again?"  
"当然。啊，我们今晚要做什么来着？"

He blushed harder. "You said we could go to your place, and, um, you know…"  
他的脸更红了。“你说过我们可以去你那儿，而且，嗯，你知道的……”

_Jackpot._ "Shinji, do you love me?" Asuka asked. "Truly and forever no matter what?"  
中奖了。“真嗣，你爱我吗？”明日香问道。“真心实意，无论发生什么，永远不变？”

"Of course!" “当然！”

"Then I have quite a surprise for you tonight."  
"那么今晚我有个相当惊喜的消息给你。"

Author notes: one of my favorite scenes from EoE is Asuka gleefully slaughtering all those JSSDF troops. She just looks so damn happy. Thus, her unusual predisposition to murder in this. Or something.  
作者笔记：我最喜欢的 EoE 场景之一是明日香兴高采烈地屠杀那些 JSSDF 部队。她看起来真是太高兴了。因此，她在这篇中对杀戮的异常倾向。或者说是别的什么。

On a related note, what the hell _was_ this?  
说到这个，这到底是什么鬼？

Hmm. Asuka sure knocked a lot of people unconscious in this. Real creative, Adam.  
嗯。明日香在这部作品里确实让很多人昏迷了。真有创意，亚当。

Also, I am aware I mixed anime and manga continuity regarding Kensuke and Toji meeting Asuka. I don't give a shit.  
另外，我知道我把动画和漫画的连续性搞混了，关于健介和渡治遇见明日香的情节。我不在乎。

OMAKE 番外

This entire pile of crap was an omake gone wrong.  
这一堆乱七八糟的东西，全是一个失控的番外产物。

LOL Akagi's final thoughts made me laught  
赤木的最后想法让我笑出声  
  
*Akagi does inhuman experiments that go against life and any resemblance of holy*  
*赤木进行着违背生命和神圣表象的非人道实验*  
Asuka: who cares about that?  
明日香：谁在乎那个？  
  
*Akagi does her job and only remotely good deed in the serie by spending hours with Shinji to make sure that he remains healty pilot*  
*在系列中，赤木唯一做的一件还算好事的就是花几个小时陪伴真嗣，确保他保持健康，继续担任驾驶员*  
Asuka: Die! Bicth! DIE!  
明日香：去死！贱人！去死！

[Kyuubi-dono](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6295203/Kyuubi-dono): At first I was like: Jeeze Red. You better hioe Unit 01 doesn't come after you for emotionally damaging her Shinji even further, but then, APPARENTLY Dr. Ikari would have approved? So okay then? The actual fuck. Noooo! ShinKawo for life! Damn Shinji for being unobservant. One of these days, he's going to fucking snap. And Lilith belp the poor soul (Looking at you Langley) that caused it. This was great though. All those fuckers were taking up space, evil, or pedophiles *cough* Misato *cough*.  
起初我心想：天啊，Red，你最好祈祷初号机不会因为你在情感上进一步伤害了她的真嗣而来找你麻烦，但后来，显然碇博士会批准？那好吧？真是见鬼了。不！真嗣和香是绝配！该死的真嗣，太不细心了。总有一天，他会彻底崩溃。而莉莉丝保佑那个可怜的灵魂（说的就是你，兰利），是他引发的这一切。不过这真是太棒了。那些混蛋们占着位置，邪恶，或是恋童癖 *咳* 美里 *咳*。

[lose](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1684104/lose): Ahh, this one is totally underrated. I loved the humor in this piece, and everything was executed perfectly. I'm too lazy to go back and pick out the certain lines that really made me crack up, but it's safe to say that there were a lot of those in this story. Also, can I just say that Asuka-centric stories are amazing? I love reading things from her warped perspective. That's probably one of the reasons that I like both this story and soloist so much. You just have a knack for writing Asuka that no other author can match. She's written so snappily, and humorously, and it's all amazing. I always watch for your portrayals of Asuka in any given fic, and this one like the others, didn't disappoint at all. Awesome story :-)  
啊，这篇真是被低估了。我喜欢这里的幽默感，一切都处理得恰到好处。我懒得回去挑出那些让我捧腹的特定台词，但可以肯定的是，这个故事里有很多这样的片段。另外，我能不能说，以明日香为中心的故事真是太棒了？我喜欢从她扭曲的视角阅读故事。这可能也是我喜欢这个故事和 soloist 的原因之一。你在写明日香方面有独特的技巧，是其他作者无法比拟的。她的形象写得既犀利又幽默，一切都令人惊叹。我总是期待你在任何同人文中对明日香的描绘，而这一篇和其他作品一样，完全没有让我失望。棒极了的故事:-)

[RagnartheSemiGreen](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3665460/RagnartheSemiGreen): I laughed so hard at Asuka's increasing body count that I think I ruptured something! Bravo, thanks for the laugh.  
我对明日香不断增加的击杀数笑得停不下来，感觉自己都要笑出内伤了！太棒了，感谢这份欢乐。

[Archnecromancer King](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3548155/Archnecromancer-King): The strange thing is that I cannot say I find it impossible. Asuka was always one step away from being a psychopath in the canon. Thanks for the story.  
奇怪的是，我不能说我觉得这不可能。在原作中，明日香总是离成为精神病患者只有一步之遥。感谢你的故事。

[dzk87](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2189549/dzk87):
What da FUCK! 搞什么鬼！  
  
No, seriously. So i read your latest fic before this. Well, shit dude, now I know where you came from. I was honestly hoping that you had written a Normal ShinjixAsuka fic. Because you writing is would be far superior to anything most others make.  
不，说真的。我在这之前读了你最新的同人文。好吧，伙计，现在我知道你是从哪儿来的了。我真心希望你写的是一篇普通的真嗣和明日香的故事。因为你的写作水平远超大多数人的作品。  
  
It was still funny, or as you said, horrible humor. The end cracked me up so much, and is so quotable. "Wasn't it obvious."  
虽然还是很有趣，或者说，如你所说，是糟糕的幽默。结尾让我笑得不行，而且非常值得引用。“难道不明显吗？”  
  
However, why was Gendo so criminally bad. Except his one pulling that off moment, he was incompetent. How would nobody notice that Asuka became a serial murderer?  
然而，为什么源堂会如此罪恶滔天。除了他那一次得手之外，他简直是无能至极。怎么会没有人注意到明日香变成了连环杀手呢？

[iamjustanotherguy](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1408759/iamjustanotherguy): ...words cannot convey what I am thinking right now. this was...not sure how to describe it. I laughed I cried laughing and then got confused with him being gay but laughed again. This was great.  
...此刻的心情难以言表。这部作品...不知如何形容。我笑过，哭过，又因他的性取向而困惑，但最终还是笑了。真是太棒了。

[Sideris](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/665514/Sideris):
Huh, Asuka's got a hand fetish. Man, that makes the opening of EOE all the more hilarious. No wonder she wanted to watch inside the traincar. Hurr hurr hurr.  
哈，明日香有恋手癖啊。难怪《EOE》开头那么搞笑。难怪她想在电车里看。哈哈哈。  
  
At least she's got the old rote to rely on, poor Toji.  
至少她还有老一套可以依靠，可怜的冬二。  
  
And poor Rei. Oh her literal wit.  
还有可怜的丽。哦，她那字面上的机智。  
  
"Section-2 dealt with the stray dog problem in this complex weeks ago."  
“几周前，第二区就已经处理了这个社区的流浪狗问题。”  
  
"… God, I hate you so, so much." - that's comedy gold on my screen.  
“…天啊，我真是恨死你了。”——屏幕上这一幕简直是喜剧黄金。  
  
And clearly, because we're all a bunch of fools and fans, it was solidly the shower walk-in that sealed the deal in Asuka's mind. Don't lie. None of us can.  
显然，因为我们都是一群傻瓜和粉丝，正是那次淋浴间的走进彻底打动了明日香的心。别撒谎。我们谁也做不到。  
  
Gasp! Not Pen-Pen! NOT PEN-PEN! D: I shall hold constant vigil for Our Brave Bird.  
喘气！不是 Pen-Pen！不是 Pen-Pen！D: 我将时刻守护我们勇敢的鸟儿。  
  
"Why, God?" Because you don't have a high enough profit margin in merchandising, Kensuke.  
“为什么，上帝？”因为你周边商品的利润还不够高， Kensuke。  
  
Oh, come on! That's so typical! Kaji would have surely copped a FEEL on Shinji before vanishing. :P  
哦，得了吧！真是老套！Kaji 肯定会在消失前对 Shinji 上下其手的。:P  
  
Bahahahahaha, oh Gendo, oh Rits. Never change. Oh, yeah, poor Misato.  
哈哈哈哈哈，哦，Gendo，哦，Rits。永远别变。哦，对了，可怜的 Misato。  
  
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Mana! A second vigil shall be held. You bastard.  
不！！！！！！！！！！！！！！玛娜！将举行第二次守夜。你这个混蛋。  
  
Huh, 'how well Asuka and Yui would have gotten along.' I know we've talked about that a lot and it still skips around in my head. Iokaste is part of that line of thought. But this kind of sprouted a new idea. Hmm.  
嗯，‘明日香和唯会相处得多好’。我知道我们讨论过很多次，这想法仍在我脑海中跳来跳去。伊奥卡斯特也是这一思路的一部分。但这引发了一个新想法。嗯。  
  
Bridge Bunny Massacre, new at Tokyo-03 theaters!  
桥兔大屠杀，东京-03 影院新上映！  
  
...and I've stopped laughing finally from Gendo's amazing 'This does not bode well.' Whew. Damn. That struck me the right way, I guess.  
...终于，我从碇源堂那句惊人的‘这可不是好兆头’中止住了笑声。呼，该死。我想那句话真是戳中了我。  
  
Is it wrong that I totally pictured Lloyd's crazed shooting from the end of Dumb and Dumber when she started screaming 'die' at Kaworu? Probably not.  
当她开始对渚薰尖叫‘去死’时，我完全想象到了《阿呆与阿瓜》结尾时劳埃德疯狂射击的场景，这有错吗？大概没有。  
  
What was this, Adam? Hilarity, that's what. Honestly, all that was missing was perhaps a stolen line from Gurren Laggen, like,  
这是什么，亚当？搞笑啊，就是搞笑。老实说，唯一缺少的可能就是《天元突破》里的某句盗用台词了，比如，  
  
HIS WAS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE HER HEAVENS!  
这是能刺穿她天际的钻头！  
  
Or something punny and sick like that.  
或者类似那种俏皮又病态的说法。  
  
Oh yeah, Hikari died too. Pfft.  
哦对了，光也死了。切。

[Dark09](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2446950/Dark09): ...LOL!Well at least asuka and shinji live happily ever after...? Very good job on this fic mate xD!  Keep up the great work!
...哈哈！至少明日香和真嗣从此幸福地生活在一起了？这篇同人写得真棒，伙计，笑死我了！继续保持这么出色的工作！

[Da-Guru](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1022757/Da-Guru):
Ahh, I love the smell of slaughter in the morning. This makes a great comedy. Then again, I'm a big fan of black comedy.  
啊，我喜欢清晨屠杀的气息。这真是一部绝佳的喜剧。不过话说回来，我可是黑色喜剧的忠实粉丝。  
  
You know, I've always wanted to see Shinji himself go on a bloody rampage of wanton destruction, exacerbating his existing neuroses into absurdity until it reaches a psychotic singularity and breaks the universe. Then the universe resets and none of it happened. So Shinji gets to do the whole thing again. WEEEEEE!  
你知道吗，我一直想看到真嗣本人发起一场血腥的破坏狂潮，将他已有的神经质推向荒谬的极致，直到达到精神病的奇点并打破宇宙。然后宇宙重置，这一切都没发生过。于是真嗣又得重新来一遍。哇哦哦哦哦！  
  
On another note, this has to be the funniest thing I've seen you write in a good while. You've got a real mind for black comedy. You should work with that more often.  
另外，这一定是我这段时间以来看到你写的最搞笑的东西了。你对黑色幽默真的很有天赋。你应该多在这方面下功夫。
