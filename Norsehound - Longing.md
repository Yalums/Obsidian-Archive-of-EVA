**I. Desolate 一、荒凉**

The room was so different now. Especially within the past few weeks, more and more of her belongings had become targets for her mounting frustrations. Yesterday it had been a teacup gift from her father. Today it was a pillow and the latest subscription to a Japanese fashion magazine she had hoped would have greater relevance. These things were destroyed upon her floor as she raged into her pillow.  
房间现在变得截然不同。尤其是最近几周，她的越来越多的私人物品成了她日益增长的挫败感的靶子。昨天是她父亲送的一个茶杯遭了殃。今天则是一个枕头和她订阅的最新一期日本时尚杂志，她本希望这本杂志能更有参考价值。这些东西都被她愤怒地摔在地上，她对着枕头怒吼。

"I got that she made it, okay! Damnit Misato, don't call me over every little thing!"  
“我知道是她做的，行了吧！该死的，美里，别为了一点小事就叫我过来！”

Only moments ago, through the phone now resting on the far side of the room, Misato had called from the base to fill Asuka in on the cleanup operations.  
就在刚才，通过现在搁置在房间另一头的电话，美里从基地打来电话，向明日香通报了清理行动的进展。

There was no word about Shinji. Just about _first._  
关于真嗣的消息一点也没有。只有关于第一次的。

Asuka breathed through the pillow fibers. "To think… to think I couldn't do anything! I can't believe i lost to that stupid Shinji!"  
明日香透过枕头纤维呼吸着。“想想看……想想看我竟然什么都做不了！我居然输给了那个笨蛋真嗣！”

At last, a meaty angel she could confront solo. Armed with every weapon she could get, without any teammates to get in the way (and no Shinji) to worry about, she would be victorious.  
终于，一个她可以单独面对的强大天使。装备了所有能拿到的武器，没有队友碍事（也没有真嗣）需要担心，她必将取得胜利。

Only… she wasn't. 只是……她并没有。

She found out later that not only did Shinji return, but he easily defeated the Angel and saved everyone. It was what _she_ was supposed to do, and on a whim third had changed his mind and come back.  
后来她得知，真嗣不仅回来了，还轻松击败了天使，拯救了所有人。这本是她应该做的，但真嗣一时兴起改变了主意，回来了。

He didn't choose to do this to save her. He chose to do it to _one-up_ her.  
他这么做并非为了救她，而是为了胜她一筹。

She grabbed the pillow tighter. "I hate this!"  
她更紧地抓住了枕头。“我讨厌这样！”

Longing 渴望

_Asuka Birthday Fic 2022 明日香生日贺文 2022_

Norsehound 北欧猎犬

---

Asuka had once dreamed of having an entire apartment like this to herself. Now, even with her roommates gone, the detritus and clutter of Misato's dwelling was like a constant irritant on Asuka's skin. As she moved through the air she felt unclean.  
明日香曾梦想拥有这样一整套公寓。如今，即便室友们都已离开，美里住所的残骸和杂乱无章却如同附着在明日香皮肤上的持续刺激。她在空气中移动时，感到自己不洁。

But to relocate would mean packing everything up, making a big fuss, getting Misato into her face. Maybe pathetic Shinj-  
但若要搬家，就意味着要打包所有东西，大动干戈，还得让惣流来烦她。或许可怜的真嗣——

She threw the bra she had pulled out of the closet and raged again, screaming and driving her fists through the air until she hit the wall. The dents of her fists were already there, but she didn't care anymore. It's not like the owner of the apartment, Misato, would care. All the woman cared about was Shinji-_sama_.  
她将刚从衣柜里拽出的胸罩一扔，再次怒火中烧，尖叫着挥拳击打空气，直到拳头砸在墙上。墙上早已布满她的拳印，但她已不在乎。反正这公寓的主人，惣流，也不会在意。那女人只关心真嗣大人。

Asuka huffed angrily then decided she wasn't going to dress after all. She threw the door open and stepped into her apartment topless. She knew Misato wasn't in the apartment, but even if she was, Misato didn't care. Shinji-_sama_ wasn't here. As it was Misato hadn't been back in this apartment since the battle two days ago.  
明日香气呼呼地哼了一声，决定干脆不穿衣服了。她猛地推开门，光着上身走进公寓。她知道惣流不在家，即便在，惣流也不会在意。真嗣大人不在这里。自从两天前那场战斗后，惣流就没回过这间公寓。

Asuka's feet patted down the hall to the kitchen where she witnessed Pen Pen trying to figure out how to open the refrigerator. Asuka stared at the scene with silent disdain. yeah, the apartment may have been abandoned to her, but now she had to take care of this stupid bird.  
明日香的脚步声在走廊中回响，她走进厨房，目睹了企鹅企企正试图弄明白如何打开冰箱。明日香冷眼旁观，心中满是不屑。没错，这间公寓或许已被遗弃给她，但现在她却得照顾这只蠢鸟。

The chore Shinji had. 真嗣留下的杂务。

She stepped forward to throwing open the refrigerator and do the work _the glorious Shinji-sama_ had left for her to do while on his vacation. Blind fury drove her to slamming the can on the counter, destroying the lid with the can opener, then dumping the thing into the stupid penguin's bowl.  
她上前一把拉开冰箱门，开始处理那位尊贵的真嗣大人度假时留给她的任务。怒火中烧，她猛地将罐头砸在台面上，用开罐器破坏了盖子，随后将里面的东西倒进那只蠢企鹅的碗里。

She glanced up and saw the bird cowering behind the curtain to the bathroom. She paused, for even though the penguin was just a dumb animal, she could see the fear in his small eyes.  
她抬头一看，发现那只鸟正躲在浴室窗帘后面瑟瑟发抖。她停了下来，尽管那只企鹅只是个愚笨的动物，但她能从它那双小眼睛里看出恐惧。

"There." She toned and pointed, "Breakfast. Now stay out of my way!"  
“那里。”她语气严厉地指着说，“早餐在那儿。现在别挡我的路！”

She whirled away from the bird and threw the can opener across the room to the sink. It bounced off the counter and clattered to the floor. Grunting, she decided to use the curry packets Misato had stockpiled. She detested them, but rather that then try to tread the domain of _all glorious Shinji-sama_ and embarrass herself there, too.  
她猛地转身离开那只鸟，将开罐器扔向房间另一头的洗手池。开罐器在台面上弹了一下，哐啷一声落在地板上。她哼了一声，决定用碇司令囤积的咖喱包。她讨厌那些咖喱包，但与其冒险踏入尊贵的真嗣大人的领域，在那里也出丑，还不如用它们。

She saw the red on her fingers then. She rasped, and sucked on the cut she must have given herself with that stupid can. Where the hell were the bandages? With a growl she realized she would have asked _Shinji_ about those too.  
她这才注意到手指上的血迹。她嘶哑地喘息着，吮吸着那个一定是被那愚蠢的罐头划破的伤口。绷带到底在哪里？她恼怒地意识到，自己本也会向真嗣询问这些的。

_Asuka, please calm down and take care of yourself._ Mock Shinji's voice said in her head.  
明日香，请冷静下来，照顾好自己。一个模仿真嗣的声音在她脑海中说道。

Asuka whirled and shouted in the direction the boy had been sitting in on that night in October. "SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP AND KEEP YOUR FUCKING CONCERN TO YOURSELF!"  
明日香猛地转身，朝着十月那个夜晚男孩坐着的方向大声吼道：“闭嘴！闭上你的嘴，把你那该死的关心留给自己吧！”

Pen Pen clattered into his refrigerator and shut the door.  
Pen Pen 跳进他的冰箱并关上了门。

Asuka waivered on her feet because, in a part of her, she wanted him here to say those things. In spite of her hollering and howling at him, he was the… the only one… to _care_. To care for her and provide something for her she came to rely on. Companionship. Food. Beyond the Evas, beyond sync ratios and battles and…  
明日香摇摇晃晃地站着，因为在她内心深处，她希望他在这里说这些话。尽管她对他大喊大叫，但他却是……唯一一个……关心她的人。关心她，为她提供她逐渐依赖的东西。陪伴。食物。超越了 EVA，超越了同步率和战斗，以及……

She still remembered the jolt in the Volcano when Shinji saved her life by grabbing her arm.  
她仍然记得在火山中，真嗣抓住她的手臂救了她一命时的那一震。

She took two unsteady steps to the kitchen table. Her emotions bubbled over and threatened to come out of her face. But she wouldn't cry. Not for him. Not for _the glorious magnanimous Shinji-sama and his golden benevolence._  
她踉跄地迈了两步走到餐桌前，情绪如沸水般翻涌，几乎要从脸上溢出。但她不会哭，不会为了他，不会为了那位光辉慷慨的真嗣大人及其金色的仁慈而哭泣。

She screamed again clutched her head In frustration and turmoil, caught between her feelings.  
她再次尖叫，双手紧抓着头，在情感的纠结与混乱中挣扎。

"Kaji!" She suddenly realized, hoped, and cried, "Kaji!"  
"卡兹!" 她突然意识到，希望，并呼喊着，"卡兹!"

She wailed pathetically as if he could hear her. And as she judged herself for this pathetic display, she also beheld her mental image of Ryoji Kaji.  
她可怜地哀嚎着，仿佛他能听见似的。当她为自己这可怜的表现而自责时，她的脑海中也浮现出了加持良治的形象。

…Who receded into the distance, his voice sounding like it came through the phone. _"Im sorry Asuka, I'm not available right now. If you please leave your message, I'll return your call in the order it was received."_  
……他渐行渐远，声音听起来像是通过电话传来的。"对不起，明日香，我现在没空。如果你愿意留下信息，我会按照收到信息的顺序回电。"

Slamming her fists on the table she tried to call down by breathing. Her imagination was running away from her yes, but she was also quite lost and defeated.  
她猛地捶打桌子，试图通过深呼吸平复情绪。她的想象力确实在失控，但她也深感迷茫和挫败。

She eased herself into one of the chairs of the now silent room and put her head on the table. There she allowed herself to squeeze her eyes shut and maybe…. Maybe allow herself some tears. Disgust followed that thought. Her? Cry?  
她缓缓坐进这间静默房间的一把椅子，将头搁在桌上。在那里，她允许自己闭上双眼，或许……或许容许自己流下几滴泪。但这个念头随即引来一阵厌恶。她？哭泣？

If only this were a problem she could take with both hands. Reach up and grab the throat of the issue, tightening and twisting so-  
要是这问题能让她双手抓住就好了。伸手扼住问题的咽喉，紧握并扭转——

Her arms were gone at the shoulders.  
她的双臂从肩膀处消失了。

Asuka's fingers slid to grab them subconsciously as her mind unspooled her latest failure before her, again. She waited to remember the moment where she charged at the angel, armless, ready to beat her head against it to win.  
明日香的指尖下意识地抓握着，脑海中再次浮现出最近的失败。她等待着回忆起那一刻，自己无臂却勇往直前地冲向使徒，准备用头撞击以赢得胜利。

Then it flew off. She tumbled through the air. She landed, crushing walls and structure. And who did she find in the corner of the room? Like a coward?  
随后它飞走了。她在空中翻滚，落地时摧毁了墙壁和建筑。而在房间的角落，她发现了谁？像个懦夫一样？

Shinji. 真嗣。

_Asuka_, the image asked as it stood up from cowering, _are you all right? What's wrong?_  
明日香，那个影像站起来，从畏缩中恢复，问道：你还好吗？怎么了？

She tried to scream at him. Fat chance for your concern. Where was all this consideration before, dumbass? "You left us all behind, idiot!" She blasted aloud.  
她试图对他尖叫。关心？真是天大的笑话。之前你都去哪儿了，蠢货？“你把我们都抛下了，白痴！”她大声斥责道。

The kitchen sat empty. Her stomach gurgled to remind her of the food she hadn't prepared yet. And reality continued to slip and slide into anguish.  
厨房空无一人。她的肚子咕噜作响，提醒她还没准备食物。而现实继续滑入痛苦的深渊。

It was like this in the three days after the battle.  
战斗后的三天里，情况便是如此。

---

Misato was in that rare time when she had nothing to do. At least, for now.  
碇真嗣正处于那难得的无所事事的时刻。至少目前如此。

Work was proceeding in all areas without her. Evangelion 00 and 02 were being repaired slowly. Most of the cages effort was directed at understanding and preparing unit 01 for the salvage operation to recover Shinji.  
工作在她缺席的情况下仍在各领域推进。零号机和二号机正在缓慢修复中。大部分的努力都集中在理解和准备初号机上，以便进行救援行动，找回真嗣。

Misato had already filed her reports, signed off on the appropriate paperwork, and testified to those who wanted her. Now she just needed to wait for something to develop for her to react to.  
美里已经提交了报告，签署了必要的文件，并向需要她的人提供了证词。现在，她只需等待事态发展，以便做出反应。

Even if that something was unit 01.  
即便那事态是关于初号机的。

She stared back at the head which glowered down at her, still bandaged. Under the rows of teeth she looked into the gleaming green eye.  
她回望着那颗俯视着她、依旧缠着绷带的头颅，目光穿过层层利齿，对上了那只闪烁着绿光的眼睛。

Clutching a fist, she began. "Shinji." She said.  
她紧握拳头，开始说道：“真嗣。”她说。

The monster said nothing.  
怪物默不作声。

"Shinji. Come home. Please?"  
真嗣，回家吧，好吗？

Nothing. 什么也没有。

Misato flexed her fingers within her fist and angrily glanced at the armor, then she looked back into the eye. "Shinji, we're doing everything in our power to bring you back. We… we miss you."  
葛城美里紧握拳头，手指微微伸展，愤怒地瞥了一眼装甲，随后又望向那只眼睛。“真嗣，我们正在尽全力带你回来。我们……我们想念你。”

Nothing. 什么也没有。

Breathing out, Misato looked down at the armor. "What am I doing? I've lost Shinji, Asuka's coming apart, and I can't do _anything_."  
深吸一口气，惣流低头看着那副装甲。“我到底在做什么？我失去了真嗣，明日香也快崩溃了，我却无能为力。”

Misato looked up at the monster one last time, then sighed angrily and walked off the gantry.  
碇真嗣最后一次抬头望向那怪物，随后愤怒地叹了口气，离开了栈桥。

Evangelion unit 01 stood mute.  
初号机静默伫立。

---

The morning of the fifth day found Asuka just numb. She hadn't slept well and the world was a blur from so much anger practiced in the past few days.  
第五天的清晨，明日香只是麻木。她睡得不好，过去几天里积攒的愤怒让世界变得模糊不清。

She got out of bed amidst the soft white light of the sun through curtains. She shoved aside debris with her feet and stepped up to the closet door which was now jammed open. She chose a simple nightgown, pink with red trim.  
她在透过窗帘的柔和白光中起床，用脚推开杂物，走向如今卡住的衣柜门。她选了一件简单的睡裙，粉底红边。

Exhausted, she stood in front of the closet unmoving. Just existing. Before she could realize what she resembled, she-  
精疲力竭的她，站在衣柜前一动不动，只是存在着。在她意识到自己的模样之前，她——

_I'm sorry. 对不起。_

She hadn't heard those words as much as acknowledged that someone said them. She knew it had been Shinji, too.  
她并没有真正听到那些话，只是意识到有人说了。她也知道那人是真嗣。

Her nerves were too frayed to attack that thought as they had in the past few days. This time she let it pass quietly, eyes staring at nothing.  
她的神经已过于疲惫，无法像过去几天那样去攻击那个念头。这次，她任由它悄然溜走，双眼空洞地凝视着虚空。

The fragment of will she still had directed her to the kitchen so she turned and moved. The door opened to-  
她仅存的一丝意志指引她走向厨房，于是她转身移动。门随之打开——

Shinji. 真嗣。

She stood frozen as she stared at the door. Hundreds of thoughts and emotions ran through her head then: white hot rage over his cluelessness, the sticky warmth of lust to prove she was a woman now, the longing for his caretaking to salve her hurts, the confusion over the wall of silence he surrounded himself with.  
她僵立着，凝视着那扇门。无数思绪与情感在脑海中交织：对他无知无觉的炽烈怒火，欲证明自己已成女人的粘稠欲望，渴望他关怀抚慰伤痛的期盼，以及对他所筑沉默之墙的困惑不解。

_I'm sorry… 对不起…_

She ignored him. Her spent body resumed course for the kitchen, patting her way across the cold wooden floors into the common room, then into the kitchen.  
她无视了他。疲惫的身体继续向厨房行进，摸索着穿过冰冷的木地板，进入公共休息室，再进入厨房。

Signs of distress from the past few days were all over the place. The stupid used curry trays were cluttered on one side if the table. Stacked cans of tuna sat beside Pen Pen's food bowl. A towel was dropped in front of the way to the bathroom. One of the overhead lights had burned out from being on for three days continuously. A single beer can, from lunch yesterday, sat on the table after Asuka consumed half of it. It didn't help.  
过去几日的窘迫迹象随处可见。愚蠢的咖喱托盘杂乱地堆在桌边，金枪鱼罐头叠放在 Pen Pen 的食盆旁。一条毛巾丢弃在通往浴室的途中。由于连续三天不间断使用，一盏顶灯已经烧坏。昨日午餐时，明日香喝剩一半的啤酒罐孤零零地立在桌上，却无济于事。

She looked at the curry packets. Not only were they disgusting to her taste buds, but she was starting to run out of them. She would need to go shopping soon… another responsibility dropped on her by the absence of the _oh magnificent Shinji the capable_.  
她望着那些咖喱包，不仅因为口味让她感到恶心，而且她也开始用完了。她很快就需要去购物了……这是能干的、伟大的真嗣不在时，又一项落在她肩上的责任。

Today she didn't have energy to react to that thought. Yesterday's response was still painted the side of the kitchen cabinet, where her rage and frustration blasted the curry meal against the wall. Now she was just spent.  
今天，她已无力对那个念头做出反应。昨日的回应仍如画般留在厨房橱柜旁，她的愤怒与挫败感将咖喱餐食砸向墙壁。此刻，她已筋疲力尽。

_I'm sorry… 对不起…_

"If you're sorry," she uttered, "DO something."  
“如果你感到抱歉，”她低声说，“那就做点什么。”

She didn't know why she turned and faced the entryway to the front door. But her feet aimed her that direction as she went on, "You always go on about being sorry. Tell me you're really sorry by DOING SOMETHING." Her eyes bugged as she angrily stressed her words.  
她不知道自己为何转身面向前门的入口，但她的脚步却自然而然地朝那个方向迈去，她继续说道：“你总是口口声声说对不起。用行动告诉我你是真的感到抱歉，做点什么吧。”她愤怒地加重语气，眼睛瞪得大大的。

She didn't know how or why she was carrying this conversation, but she continued, "If you won't DO anything then leave me the fuck alone!"  
她不知道自己是怎么或为什么在继续这场对话，但她还是说道：“如果你什么都不打算做，那就他妈的别来烦我！”

She didn't hear a voice, but she imagined the sensation of Shinji falling away, retreating to wherever it was he came from. The apartment now felt more empty than ever.  
她没有听到声音，但脑海中浮现出真嗣逐渐远去，退回到他来时的地方的画面。此刻，公寓比以往任何时候都显得更加空荡。

Panting, tired, and near tears she spat through her teeth and mustered the energy to make her meal. Anything to avoid confronting anyone on a grocery trip or fast food hunt.  
喘息着，疲惫不堪，眼眶含泪，她咬紧牙关，勉强聚集力气准备餐食。只为避免在采购或快餐搜寻中与任何人正面交锋。

---

Misato said over the phone, "They've finished stabilizing unit 01, so repair work is starting on your unit and Rei's"  
电话那头，美里说道：“他们已经完成了对零号机的稳定工作，现在开始修复你的机体和绫波的。”

"Okay." Asuka answered. "好的。" 明日香回答道。

"The main bridge has been officially condemned now, it's likely you'll never see it again. The back up bridge is older but, it will do."  
"主舰桥现在已经正式被废弃了，你可能再也见不到它了。备用舰桥虽然老旧，但还能用。"

"Okay." "好的。"

"I'll be here again tonight overseeing repairs to the geofront ceiling, I know you and Pen Pen might be getting low on supplies, ill come shop for groceries tomorrow."  
今晚我会再次来这里监督地下都市顶部的修复工作，我知道你和 Pen Pen 可能快没生活用品了，我明天会去买些杂货。

"Okay." 好的。

"Well… that's it. I'll call you tonight to see how things are going."  
“嗯……就这样。我今晚给你打电话，看看情况如何。”

"Okay." 好的。

"Ya… well…" the line went dead.  
"呀……呃……" 电话断了。

Sitting at the table in the living room with the TV on, but muted, Asuka set the phone down and stared at the mute figures moving on the screen. A silent make believe world was playing out all before her eyes.  
坐在客厅的桌旁，电视开着却静音了，明日香放下手机，凝视着屏幕上无声移动的画面。一个寂静的虚构世界在她眼前上演。

"Bitch didn't bother to ask how I was doing." Asuka grumbled, then she stood up and kicked one of the folding chairs over in the direction of Misato's room. "Some guardian you are. I know who's the favorite around here."  
"这贱人连问都不问一句我过得怎么样。" 明日香嘟囔着，随后站起身，一脚将折叠椅踢向了美里房间的方向。"你这监护人当得真好。我知道谁才是这里的宠儿。"

_I'm sorry… 对不起…_

She ignored that impulse. If it was some fragment of Shinji, clawing his way out of her memories, she already said her ultimatum. Otherwise, it was just one more sign the stress of everything was slowly driving her crazy.  
她无视了那股冲动。如果那是真嗣的某个碎片，试图从她的记忆中挣脱出来，她已经给出了最后通牒。否则，这只是又一个迹象，表明一切的压力正逐渐将她逼疯。

Her stomach gurgled. 她的肚子咕噜作响。

She returned to the ruin of the kitchen and stopped in front of the sink, staring at the cooking bowl she had used to make rice. It was dirty, but she didn't want to clean it. She clenched her fists as her first impulse was to tell Shinji to do it but, of course, the _magaminus Shinji-sama_ wasn't here to-  
她回到厨房的废墟中，在洗碗池前停下，凝视着用来煮饭的锅。它脏兮兮的，但她不想清洗。她紧握拳头，本能地想叫真嗣来做，但当然，那位魔法师真嗣大人并不在这里。

_I'm sorry… 对不起…_

"You don't mean it." She said to the memory, "You always say that, idiot, but you never do anything to make it better."  
“你不是认真的。”她对着记忆说，“你总是这么说，傻瓜，但你从没采取任何行动让它变好。”

She sighed angrily and started the water and found the soap. She found a couple more things and scrubbed the bowl herself. It wasn't hard, but several months of Shinji doing it for everyone meant she needed to spend mental effort to find things and do this. She just wanted to be left alone.  
她气愤地叹了口气，开始放水并找到了肥皂。她又找到了几样东西，自己动手刷洗碗碟。这并不难，但几个月来都是真嗣为大家做这些，意味着她需要花费心力去寻找物品并完成这项任务。她只想一个人静静。

_I'm sorry… 对不起…_

"Go away." She uttered. "走开。" 她低声说道。

The pot now clean and filled with water. She landed it on the stove and turned on the burner. She stood there lost in thought as she watched the water boil, exhausted.  
锅已洗净并装满水。她将其放在炉子上，打开了火。她站在那里，陷入了沉思，看着水沸腾，感到筋疲力尽。

How long would she avoid going to school? It's not like Misato cared now about grades and attendance. She could talk to Hikari if she went, maybe, but she wasn't sure if she was up to Hikari's meek concerns. She still hadn't talked to her best friend about how the date went, either. She didn't want to deal with that tension.  
她还要逃避上学多久呢？现在，对于成绩和出勤，美里已经不再那么在意了。如果去学校，或许可以和光谈谈，但她不确定自己是否能应对光那温和的关切。她甚至还没跟最好的朋友谈过那次约会的经过，也不想面对那种紧张气氛。

The weight of all those unresolved concerns, tangled concerns, and unspoken things rested on her now. Like a tarp overhang sagging after a rainstorm, filled with the weight of so many putrid issues. This was all she was left with in that quiet apartment.  
那些未解的忧虑、纠缠不清的烦恼和未曾言说的事情，如今都压在了她的肩上。宛如一场暴雨过后，遮阳篷因承载了太多腐朽问题而下垂。在这寂静的公寓里，这便是她所剩的一切。

After finishing the rice, she scrambled an egg and found some ground meat to brown and serve with this ad hoc meal. She ate in silence, for once feeling the emptiness of the apartment around her. It hadn't been this peaceful in days.  
吃完米饭后，她匆忙煎了个鸡蛋，又找了些肉末炒熟，临时凑成一餐。她默默地吃着，这一刻，感受到了四周公寓的空旷。已经好几天没有这么宁静了。

It felt like the eye of a hurricane. Peripherally she knew that once she engaged with normal life again the anger would return. The violence would flare up.  
感觉就像飓风之眼。她隐约意识到，一旦重新投入日常生活，愤怒将再次袭来，暴力也会重新爆发。

The dregs of her meal tasted oily and unpleasant. She halted before finishing completely, wiping her mouth with the back,of her hand and considering the utterly trashed kitchen. She was disgusted all over again- at Misato, at herself, and at _Shinji-sama_.  
她餐后的残渣油腻且令人不快，她没吃完就停了下来，用手背擦了擦嘴，目光扫过一片狼藉的厨房。她再次感到厌恶——对美里，对自己，也对真嗣大人。

This time there was no faraway apology, though she had half stood in anticipation of it. She turned a little to face the door into the living room, where long before he had sat in that red shirt. But there was nothing.  
这次没有遥远的道歉，尽管她半起身期待着。她微微转身面向通往客厅的门，很久以前他曾坐在那里，穿着那件红衬衫。但什么也没有。

She was alone. 她孤身一人。

Easing out a breath of relief in the absence of his imagined, empty, throwaway apologies she strode over his absence in the room to stare into the TV and fill her mind with garbage.  
在他那想象中的、空洞的、毫无诚意的道歉缺席时，她松了一口气，大步跨过他留下的空缺，凝视着电视，让垃圾信息填满自己的思绪。

---

Night. 夜晚。

The TV and solitary light in the kitchen were on, but the rest of the house was dark. A bowl with the last of the rice and remaining egg sat next to her aborted lunch. The kitchen might as well be condemned.  
电视机和厨房里孤零零的灯光亮着，但屋子的其他部分一片漆黑。一碗剩饭和剩下的鸡蛋放在她未完成的午餐旁边。这厨房简直就像是被废弃了似的。

The TV was on though, blaring a late night movie. Asuka had sat now through three complete installments of Gamera movies, laughing silently at all the foolish assumptions and stupidity regarding giant monsters and children. Ridiculous.  
电视还开着，正播放着一部深夜电影。明日香已经坐着看完了三部《加美拉》电影，她默默地笑看那些关于巨型怪兽和孩子们的愚蠢假设和愚蠢行为。真是荒谬。

The phone rang. 电话响了。

Asuka lifted her head from the chair and turned to look but stopped. Her hand gripped the side of the table but she remained frozen, peering into the one lit room in the house, just listening to the phone.  
明日香从椅子上抬起头，转过去想要看，却又停住了。她的手紧抓着桌边，身体却僵在那里，凝视着屋内唯一亮着灯的房间，只是静静地听着电话。

It must be Misato. Nobody else would call.  
肯定是美里。除了她没人会打电话来。

Asuka couldn't bring herself to move, because she knew how the conversation would go already. There's no change from the situation. I'm still here overseeing operations. I'll be by tomorrow with new groceries, but then I have to get back. Make sure pen pen is fed, bye. What more could Asuka expect? It's not like the woman really cared about her.  
明日香动弹不得，因为她已经知道对话会如何发展。情况没有任何改变。我还在这里监督操作。明天我会带新的食品过来，但之后我得马上回去。记得喂企鹅，再见。明日香还能期待什么呢？那女人并不真的关心她。

Asuka was aware of the silence then, the phone had stopped ringing. She turned back around to watch the TV again.  
明日香意识到那时静了下来，电话铃声已经停止。她转过身，再次看向电视。

When The phone started ringing a second time, Asuka just turned up the volume.  
当电话第二次响起时，明日香只是调高了音量。

---

Darkness. 黑暗。

The moon quietly beamed through the deck and into the ruins of Asuka's room. The girl lay under the wide white and blue bed, eyes open and staring at nothing.  
月光悄然洒过甲板，照进明日香房间的废墟。少女躺在宽大的蓝白床下，双眼睁开，空洞地凝视着虚无。

Crickets sang somewhere outside. It was too late for anyone else to be awake, really. The city was hushed outside too.  
屋外某处，蟋蟀鸣唱。夜已深，理应无人醒。城外亦是一片静谧。

She blinked and tried to summon sleep by closing her eyes, but something was bothering her. Something refused to let her sleep.  
她眨了眨眼，试图通过闭上眼睛来召唤睡意，但有什么东西在困扰着她。有什么东西拒绝让她入睡。

Grunting once she got out of bed and stepped over the wreckage to the door and opened it. The void of the hall silently screamed at her.  
她哼了一声，从床上爬起来，跨过废墟走向门口，打开了它。空荡荡的走廊无声地向她尖叫。

Naked feet platted down the boards as she walked from the hall to the living room. The TV was off hours ago. The curtains allowed the moon in here too, and there was a slight chill.  
她赤脚踩在木板上，从大厅走向客厅。电视几小时前就关了。窗帘也透进了月光，带来一丝微凉。

She passed into the kitchen. The overhead light was on, but the other had burned out. The fluorescent humming could be heard un the quiet there as she crossed over Shinji's failure and passed over where she had made her proposal. Down the runway where Kaji failed her, to the door where the man she wanted vanished into the night wearing Misato's stink.  
她走进厨房，头顶的灯光亮着，但另一盏已经熄灭。在这片静谧中，她穿过真嗣的失败之地，经过自己提出建议的地方，沿着卡吉曾让她失望的通道，直至那扇门，那个她心仪的男人带着美里留下的气息消失在夜色中。

Asuka checked the door. Locked. She looked at the shoes.  
明日香检查了门。锁着的。她看向那些鞋子。

The gaps on the pad yawned up at her. It was like an airport tarmac, or a harbor, where the once busy port of call was now vacant of tenants. This was Misato's house, but she was gone. Shinji's things were still here, but he was gone too.  
垫子上的缝隙朝她张开。这就像机场的跑道，或是港口，曾经繁忙的停靠点如今空无一人。这里是美里家，但她已经离开。真嗣的东西还在这里，但他也不在了。

She grunted at the absence and double checked the door. This was the only way into the apartment, so if it was secure, so was she. She turned around and started for her room.  
她对这空无一人的寂静哼了一声，再次检查了门锁。这是进入公寓的唯一通道，既然门是安全的，她也就安全了。她转过身，开始向自己的房间走去。

Halfway down the hall the other kitchen light buzzed and darkened with a pop. Asuka sighed. She reached out with a hand to feel her way in the dark, thinking now that she should leave the bathroom light on to navigate. There were no night lights in Misato's apartment.  
走廊半途中的另一盏厨房灯嗡嗡作响，随着一声爆裂声暗了下来。明日香叹了口气。她伸出手在黑暗中摸索前行，心想现在应该开着浴室灯以便导航。美里公寓里没有夜灯。

She rounded the passage into the kitchen. Through the entry into the living room, moonlight peeked through to guide her way.  
她拐进通往厨房的过道。透过客厅入口，月光悄然洒入，为她指引着方向。

Her first step into the kitchen made the hairs on her neck bristle. Someone was here… no… _someone_ _was_ _coming_.  
她刚踏进厨房，颈后的毛发便竖了起来。有人在这里……不……有人正过来。

Fear lept into her heart at the irrational sensation, but she tried to instinctively seek out light. Navigating by moonlight and using the phone's display LEDs for navigation, she made it to the bathroom and fumbled for the switch.  
这无端的预感让恐惧涌上心头，但她本能地寻找着光亮。借助月光和手机显示屏的 LED 灯导航，她摸索着到了浴室，并四处寻找开关。

She found it and flipped it on.  
她找到了它并将其打开。

Asuka exhaled a breath of relief as the light bathed the space. The humidity vent was on too, and the rushing of air helped crowd out the silence. While she was here she decided to use the toilet.  
明日香松了一口气，光芒照亮了空间。湿度调节器也在运作，呼啸的风声驱散了寂静。既然在这里，她决定顺便上个厕所。

As she sat after doing her business she winced and tried to listen. It sounded like the bath was running. Concluding her business she stepped out of the toilet and looked into the darkened bathroom. The tub wasn't on.  
解决完事情后，她坐下来，皱了皱眉，试图倾听。听起来像是浴缸在放水。处理完毕，她走出厕所，望向昏暗的浴室。浴缸并没有开启。

She hesitated at the sliding curtain, a clenched hand going up to her chest, a foreboding feeling creeping up her esophagus. It felt like someone was out there.  
她站在滑动窗帘前犹豫不决，紧握的手贴在胸前，一种不祥的预感沿着食道悄然升起。感觉外面似乎有人。

Breathing, she checked herself and straightened. This was ridiculous. Asuka didn't believe in ghosts. She had just checked the front door. Pen Pen was the only other resident currently home. Misato's door had been wide open, signaling that she hadn't just slipped in during the night.  
她深吸一口气，调整了下状态，挺直了身子。这太荒谬了，明日香从不相信鬼魂之说。她刚刚才检查过前门，目前家里除了她，就只有企鹅片片。而葛城房间的门大开着，说明她并没有在夜里悄悄溜回来。

Re-centering herself with this logic, she rushed the folding door open and swept the blackened kitchen with defiant eyes. The room was still trashed, but empty. There was no one here.  
用这个逻辑重新调整自己的心态，她猛地推开折叠门，用挑衅的眼神扫视着熏黑的厨房。房间依旧一片狼藉，但空无一人。这里没有人。

Her feet thumped across the floor, over the spot Shinji had sat in october. She turned away from glancing at the moonlight again only to come to a stop when she looked down the hall.  
她的脚步声在地板上咚咚作响，越过了十月时真嗣曾坐过的位置。她再次避开月光，却在望向走廊时停下了脚步。

There was a moving shape against the darkness, standing between their doors.  
黑暗中有一个移动的影子，正站在他们两扇门之间。

Eyes wide she saw the shadow's top turn towards her, and uncurl a little from being hunched over. It stepped towards her and raised a-  
她瞪大了眼睛，看到那影子的顶部转向她，并从原本蜷缩的姿势中略微舒展开来。它向她迈进一步，并举起了——

Asuka remembered the hall light and turned it on. The bulb blinked into existence, revealing a bright, empty corridor.  
明日香记起了大厅的灯，便将其打开。灯泡闪烁着亮起，映照出一条明亮而空旷的走廊。

Asuka exhaled and took a moment to recapture her breath. She wasn't sure what she had just seen, or whether she imagined it. After the initial shock subsided, she was left with a notion. She grit her teeth and charged down the corridor.  
明日香深吸一口气，稍作停顿以恢复呼吸。她不确定刚才看到了什么，或者那是否只是她的想象。最初的震惊消退后，她心中留下了一个念头。她咬紧牙关，冲向走廊。

Grasping with talon-like fingers, she flung Shinji's door open so hard it rebounded slightly on the rollers. Asuka stared anger into the room, somehow convinced the intruder fled in here.  
她用鹰爪般的手指紧紧抓住，猛地推开真嗣的房门，力道之大让门在滑轨上反弹了一下。明日香怒目瞪视着房间，不知怎地确信入侵者逃进了这里。

Shinji's belongings glared back at her.  
真嗣的物品仿佛在瞪着她。

Panting with anger and catching herself literally chasing a ghost, she grunted angrily and slammed his door shut again. She pushed into the ruin of her room and threw the light on without wondering if she had any specters in here.  
她气喘吁吁，意识到自己竟在追寻一个幽灵，愤怒地哼了一声，再次砰地关上了他的门。她闯进自己破败的房间，毫不犹豫地打开灯，不再去想这里是否也有鬼魂出没。

Standing at its center she clenched her fists. She was still afraid of whatever this feeling was. She was also disgusted that she was being so afraid of ghosts, if it even was a ghost. No, she was just imagining the whole thing, about Shinji and what his stupid face would be doing if he could see her now.  
站在中心，她紧握双拳。她仍对这种感觉感到害怕。她同样厌恶自己竟如此害怕鬼魂，如果那真的是鬼魂的话。不，她只是在想象，想象真嗣那张愚蠢的脸如果现在看到她会是什么表情。

She squeezed her fists again as her mind sought the quickest way to boot out her fears. She turned around with the intent of going through the doors and trashing his room, but a dozen thoughts countered in protest: _Eww, go in a boys room? What disgusting things does Shinji hide in there? That wouldn't be nice to destroy something of his. Why go through the effort, he'd just be sad and nothing would change!_  
她再次紧握双拳，心中寻找着最快驱散恐惧的方法。她转身欲推门而入，大闹他的房间，但脑海中却有无数念头抗议：呃，进男生的房间？真嗣那儿藏着什么恶心的东西？毁坏他的东西可不好。何必费这劲，他只会难过，一切都不会改变！

Her head was hurting out of frustration. She needed a solution. She wanted to go to bed without the clawing feeling of someone out there to bug her.  
她的头因沮丧而疼痛，她需要一个解决办法。她希望能在没有那种被人盯上、不断骚扰的感觉下安然入睡。

There was one thing she could do.  
她还有一件事可以做。

She resisted, swaying on her feet with consternation on her face. She wasn't a little girl afraid of the monster under her bed. "I'm not a child!" She uttered.  
她抗拒着，双脚摇晃，脸上写满惊恐。她已不是那个害怕床下怪物的小女孩。“我不是孩子了！”她脱口而出。

But no other solution came to her. It also occurred to her that nobody would know, since Misato wouldn't be coming home likely until the late morning. That was enough time to wake up and undo what she was about to do.  
但她想不出其他解决办法。她也意识到，没人会知道，因为美里可能要到上午晚些时候才会回家。这段时间足够她醒来并撤销即将要做的事情。

She jammed up the door to the hall with a spare blanket. She drew the curtains closed and jammed an unpacked box into the track. Then she grabbed the sleep mask Kaji had bought her from a port of call in Spain to help her sleep on the carrier. She hadn't used it since,but used it now with the lights on in her room for that extra security.  
她用一条备用毯子堵住了通往大厅的门。拉上窗帘，又将一个未拆封的箱子塞进轨道。随后，她从行李中翻出了卡吉在西班牙港口为她购买的睡眠眼罩，那是为了帮助她在航母上入睡的。自那以后她便未曾使用，但此刻，在房间灯光的映衬下，她戴上了它，只为那份额外的安全感。

With all this in place, she could finally go to sleep.  
一切安排妥当后，她终于可以安心入睡了。

**II. Decay 二、衰败**

_The pressure was immense. Her leg was on fire from the knee down. Her collar was uncomfortably warm.  
压力巨大无比。她的腿从膝盖以下如同火烧般疼痛。领口也异常温热，令人不适。_

_The angel was dead at least, one kill for her at last. But she wasn't going to live to appreciate it. The last thread of slashed support hose above her was going to go.  
至少天使已经死了，她终于取得了一次击杀。但她却无法活着去享受这份胜利。头顶上那最后一根被割断的吊袜带也将断裂。_

_Up until then she had told herself she wasn't afraid of death. But now it was beneath her. This was it. "I don't have any regrets." She lied.  
直到那时，她还告诉自己并不害怕死亡。但现在死亡就在她脚下。这就是终结。“我没有任何遗憾。”她撒了谎。_

_The Eva groaned and screamed about her. The suit would hold out for a few moments, but she wasn't certain about how long the plug could survive. Maybe if she disconnected from the Eva and held out… perhaps there would be rescue?  
周围传来 Eva 的呻吟和尖叫。装甲还能支撑片刻，但她不确定插入栓能存活多久。或许如果她断开与 Eva 的连接并坚持下去……也许会有救援？_

_Not at this depth. 不在这种深度。_

_She looked up. She could see through the lava somehow, picking out unit 01 perched on the cliffside staring down at her.  
她抬头望去，不知怎的竟能透过熔岩，看到 01 号机正蹲踞在崖边，俯视着她。_

_Shinji's voice spoke in her ear. "I'm going to rescue you."  
"真嗣的声音在她耳边响起：“我来救你了。””_

_"Why?" Asuka replied, "I'm not useful to you, or NERV. So why are you rescuing me?"  
"为什么？" 明日香反问道，"我对你们，或者对 NERV 都没什么用处。那你为什么要救我？"_

_"I'm going to rescue you."  
"我要去救你。"_

_"Don't touch me!" "别碰我！"_

_"But… you'll die." "但是……你会死的。"_

_"i'd rather die than just be a… a trophy! I'm not a princess to be rescued! I'm not a medal for your neck, hero!"  
"我宁愿死也不愿仅仅成为一个……一个奖杯！我不是等着被救的公主！我不是挂在英雄脖子上的勋章！"_

_The Evangelion groaned under the weight. The tether was about to snap.  
福音战士在重压下呻吟。绳索即将断裂。_

_"If you can't even give me three words why you care, third, then I don't want anything from you!"  
"如果你连为什么在乎我的三个字都说不出来，第三，那我就不需要你给的任何东西！"_

_"I do care!" "我确实在乎！"_

_"Not good enough!" Asuka screeched back.  
"不够好！" 明日香尖声回击道。_

_The tether snapped. 束缚突然断裂。_

_Asuka felt the heat rise, the walls close in, and the grinding and clanking of the pressure compacting all around her. She closed her eyes and hugged herself as best as she could, while the hammering continued.  
明日香感到热度上升，四周的墙壁逼近，压力挤压着周围的一切，发出刺耳的摩擦和撞击声。她闭上眼睛，尽可能地抱紧自己，而那敲击声依旧持续着。_

---

Asuka rose to the hammering of her dream thudding in her ears. She slapped a hand to her face, feeling the mask and yanking it off.  
明日香在梦中敲击声的回响中醒来。她伸手拍向自己的脸，触摸到面具并将其扯下。

Grunting she rolled out of bed and rubbed her face, then looked at the clock. 9:43am.  
她哼了一声，从床上滚下来，揉了揉脸，然后看向时钟。9 点 43 分。

Misato's voice called from outside the room, "Asuka, what is going on, open this door!"  
美里在房间外喊道：“明日香，怎么了，快开门！”

Realizing she woke up too late and hearing the panic in Misato's voice, Asuka stumbled over her things and made it to the door. She flung the blankets out of the way and opened the sliding panel.  
意识到自己起得太晚，又听到美里声音中的慌张，明日香踉跄地跨过自己的东西，冲到门前。她猛地掀开被子，拉开了滑动门。

Both girls looked at one another. Asuka's face was mashed from the bed and outlines if the mask were on her face. The room behind her was a wreck.  
两个女孩互相对视。明日香的脸上压出了床单的痕迹，面具的轮廓也印在她的脸上。她身后的房间一片狼藉。

But Asuka saw, for just a second, wide-eyed worry on Misato's face. It gave Asuka pause, because for a brief moment, she felt touched that Misato did care.  
但明日香瞥见，仅一瞬间，美里脸上露出了惊慌的眼神。这让明日香停顿了一下，因为那一刻，她感动地意识到美里确实在乎她。

…but it was far too late, and far too little. Asuka's hurt rushed back into place, the grudge was not avenged.  
……但为时已晚，也微不足道。明日香的伤痛再次涌上心头，怨恨并未得到平息。

"Okay, I'm up." Asuka grunted, "What did you want?"  
"好的，我起来了。" 明日香嘟囔道，"你有什么事？"

Misato's concern evaporated quickly, replaced with irritation. "I'm sorry, I wanted to see if you were still alive after what I found in the kitchen. And why was your door blocked up?" Misato made a cruel smirk, "Don't tell me you were getting afraid of the dark-"  
美里迅速从关切转为恼怒。"抱歉，我只是想确认一下你是不是还活着，毕竟我在厨房发现了那些东西。还有，为什么你的门被堵住了？" 美里冷笑一声，"别告诉我你怕黑了——"

"Just Shut Up." Asuka barked and pushed her way past Misato to go to the bathroom. "Did you bring the groceries? There's nothing to eat."  
"闭嘴。"明日香厉声说道，推开美里走向洗手间。"你买菜了吗？家里没吃的了。"

Misato, irritation still on her face, paced back down the hall. "You could have just gone shopping by yourself, you know. Or called the base for me to come here sooner."  
美里脸上仍带着不悦，沿着走廊踱步回去。“你本可以自己去购物的，你知道的。或者打电话给基地，让我早点过来。”

Misato entered the kitchen as Asuka said from within the bathroom, "And maybe you could have given a shit about me and the bird you just abandoned out here while you hid in the base."  
美里走进厨房，这时从浴室传来明日香的声音：“也许你本可以关心一下我和你刚刚丢在这里的那只鸟，而不是躲在基地里。”

Misato crossed her arms. "I _did_ call. And in case it's escaped your attention, Shinji is _still_ trapped in unit 01."  
美里交叉双臂。“我确实打过电话。而且，如果我没注意到的话，真嗣还困在 01 号机里。”

"How could I forget? You'll do anything for that pathetic sad sack, won't you? Even stay by his side 24/7 hoping he'll just decide to grace us with his presence. I'll bet you'll spoon feed him too whenever he decides to come out."  
"我怎么可能忘记？你为了那个可怜的倒霉蛋什么都愿意做，不是吗？甚至 24 小时守在他身边，希望他哪天大发慈悲露个面。我敢打赌，他要是出来，你还会喂他吃饭呢。"

"You know, I didn't _have_ to come back. I didn't _have_ to get you groceries."  
"你知道的，我本可以不回来的。我本可以不给你买这些杂货。"

"I wonder why you did. Oh, right, the mascot. Can't forget the adorable bird friend."  
"我想知道你为什么这么做。哦，对了，吉祥物。不能忘了那只可爱的鸟朋友。"

"I care about you too, Asuka."  
“我也关心你，明日香。”

"Sure you do." The girl responded, "That's why you've only come to see me once in a week."  
"当然，你确实如此。" 女孩回应道，"所以你一周才来看我一次。"

"I've been busy." "我最近很忙。"

"Yep! Glad your priorities are set straight."  
"是啊！很高兴你的优先级排得这么清楚。"

Silence clung to both sides of the folding door for a moment while both women stewed. Asuka was still nursing her hurt, and Misato was weighted with guilt. "I have to go." Misato said, "Put away these groceries, some of them are perishable."  
沉默紧贴着折叠门两侧，两位女士各自沉浸在情绪中。明日香仍在抚慰自己的伤痛，而美里则背负着内疚。“我得走了。”美里说，“把这些食品收好，有些容易变质。”

"Say hello to the golden child for me." Asuka replied.  
"“替我向那个金童问好。”明日香回应道。”

Misato said nothing, but Asuka heard the front door close. She pushed aside the curtain then and saw the bags Misato had set on the kitchen table.  
碇真嗣沉默着，但明日香听到了前门关闭的声音。她推开窗帘，然后看到了碇真嗣放在厨房桌上的购物袋。

Asuka stared at them for a moment before grunting and putting them away.  
明日香盯着它们看了一会儿，然后哼了一声，把它们收了起来。

She had completely forgotten about last night and the illusion which reached out for her.  
她已彻底忘记了昨晚以及那向她伸出的幻象。

---

The days blurred by into weeks.  
日子模糊成周。

She rarely saw Pen Pen, only evidence of his passing and presence. The bathroom was occupied on occasion, sometimes the TV was left on, and the food always disappeared. Disgust finally drove her to do some cleanup to the degree that the kitchen was no longer unsightly.  
她很少见到企鹅彭彭，只有它经过和存在的痕迹。浴室偶尔会被占用，有时电视会开着，食物总是不翼而飞。最终，厌恶感驱使她进行了一些清理，使得厨房不再那么难看。

She saw Misato even less. Groceries appeared in the kitchen every four days, but the Major called infrequently in the evening. Asuka picked up when she felt like it, which was only once or twice a week.  
她见到美里更少了。厨房里每四天会出现一次杂货，但少校晚上很少打电话来。明日香想接就接，一周也就一两次。

Existence felt like it was on hold, like she was just passing time. Her Evangelion was still being repaired, Kaji still wasn't answering his phone, and she couldn't bring herself to return to school and face her classmates.  
存在感仿佛被搁置，她似乎只是在消磨时间。她的福音战士还在修理中，加持仍然没有接电话，她也无法鼓起勇气回到学校面对同学们。

Each day passed about the same as the next. November bled by without much remark.  
每一天都与前一天无异。十一月就这样平淡无奇地流逝了。

---

Later, the door to the apartment opened to admit Asuka far sooner than it was supposed to. She was back from school just after lunch.  
不久后，公寓的门比预期更早地为明日香敞开。她刚吃过午饭，便从学校回来了。

Her strides were wide as she cruised down the entry hall with her bag. Her free hand untied the red bow and pulled it off her neck, dropping it to the floor. Through the kitchen she slapped her bag on the table and stormed through the room.  
她大步流星地穿过入口大厅，手提包在身侧。空着的那只手解开颈间的红丝带，随手一扯，任其飘落在地。穿过厨房时，她猛地将包拍在桌上，怒气冲冲地穿过了房间。

Passing the door into the living room, over Shinji's seat, her momentum cut. She took two more steps and stopped in the living room, trying to breathe.  
穿过门进入客厅，在真嗣的座位上方，她的冲势戛然而止。她又走了两步，在客厅中停下，试图调整呼吸。

It was a mistake to return to class. It wasn't necessarily because she wanted to, but because she was getting stir crazy being trapped in the fowl, trashed apartment.  
回到课堂是个错误。这并非她本意，而是因为被困在那间恶臭肮脏的公寓里，她快要疯了。

So, Asuka decided to escape the monotony by finally going to school. It lasted until lunch time, when she decided to ditch.  
于是，明日香决定通过最终去上学来逃离单调的生活。这一直持续到午餐时间，那时她决定逃课。

Hikari's gentle concerns went as expected, asking how Asuka was doing, wondering if she needed help catching up. Then of course, she asked about Shinji. When Asuka had no answer for her she seemed regretful, saying, _"Maybe it's just as well he isn't here, for everyone's sake."_  
光'的温柔关怀如预期般展开，询问明日香近况，关心她是否需要帮助追赶进度。当然，她也问起了真嗣。当明日香无法回答时，她显得有些遗憾，说道：“或许他不在这里也好，对大家都好。”

Asuka noticed Suzuhara's desk was still empty. Of course. Somehow Hikari must have made the connection that Shinji was responsible for hurting Toji. Whether Shinji was responsible, or not, Asuka suddenly had much less enthusiasm to be there. So she left, returning to the vacant apartment and empty, isolated life.  
明日香注意到铃原的座位依旧空着。果然如此。不知怎的，光一定已经意识到是真嗣伤害了东治。无论真嗣是否应负责，明日香突然对留在那里失去了大部分热情。于是她离开了，回到了空荡荡的公寓，继续她孤独隔绝的生活。

Out of boredom and desperation she tried calling Kaji again. There was, of course, no response. She left a message, asking about lunch sometime, then hanging up.  
出于无聊和绝望，她再次尝试给加持打电话。当然，依旧没有回应。她留下一条信息，询问何时有空一起吃午饭，然后挂断了电话。

After pressing the button on her phone she stared into space in the direction of the refrigerator, and found herself staring at the calendar. After a moment she realized what was bothering her; It was still marked for November. She took two steps towards it, set the phone down, and tore off the month.  
按下手机按钮后，她目光空洞地望向冰箱的方向，却发现自己正盯着日历。片刻后，她意识到困扰自己的是什么：日历上仍标记着十一月。她向前迈了两步，放下手机，撕掉了那个月份。

December was revealed. Two dates, circled and marked in very loud red, up at her.  
十二月被揭晓。两个日期，用醒目的红色圈出并标注，映入她的眼帘。

December 8. Misato's birthday.  
12 月 8 日。惣流生日。

December 4. _Her_ birthday.  
12 月 4 日。她的生日。

She stared at that circled date, written kanji, with the massive hearts she drew there to make her day bigger than Misato's. She made these marks months ago, before her ignorance about Shinji wore away. It had been a different time, then.  
她凝视着那个用汉字圈出的日期，上面画着大大的心形，为了使自己的日子显得比美里的大。这些标记是她数月前留下的，那时她还对真嗣一无所知。那是一个截然不同的时期。

Back then she could have believed Shinji would celebrate it by making her a cake. That she'd describe her ideal birthday party to him as a hint that he was supposed to pick up upon and make true for her. Now she knew it was an utter waste of time. Now she knew she meant nothing to him but a notch on his victory tally on the way to being a hero.  
那时，她本可以相信真嗣会通过为她制作蛋糕来庆祝这一天。她曾向他描述自己理想中的生日派对，暗示他应该领会并为她实现。如今她明白，这一切不过是徒劳。如今她明白，对他而言，她不过是通往英雄之路上的一个胜利标记，无足轻重。

She blew the rest of the day on TV. She overlooked Shinji's door being slightly ajar.  
她把剩下的时间都花在了看电视上。她没有注意到真嗣的房门微微开着。

_Button button BUZZ! 按钮按钮，嗡嗡响！_

_Button button BUZZ! 按钮按钮，嗡嗡响！_

_Button button, button BUZZ!  
按钮按钮，按钮嗡嗡！_

_Asuka sighed and slipped the headset off. "What are you doing Third!? Are you being deliberately obtuse?! Are you even listening to the beat?"  
明日香叹了口气，摘下耳机。“你在干什么，第三！？你是故意装傻吗？！你有没有在听节奏？”_

_"I-i am…" Shinji meekly replied.  
"我...我是…" 真嗣怯懦地回答道。_

_"Then why isn't this working!?" Asuka demanded as they stood in the game pads. Misato, Rei, and the class trio were watching.  
"那为什么这不管用！？" 明日香在游戏垫上质问道，美里、绫波和班级三人组在一旁观看。_

_"I.. I don't know." 我...我不知道。_

_"You never do." Asuka replied, "anytime it matters, you don't know. You shrink. Be goddamn proactive for a change, Third!"  
"你从来都不会。" 明日香回道，"每次关键时刻，你都不知道。你退缩了。这次给我积极点，三号！"_

_Shinji stared into space, holding his headset. Then, "Okay. I'll lead."  
真嗣凝视着虚空，手里紧握着耳机。然后，"好吧。我来带头。"_

_For some reason Asuka didn't protest. She just slipped the headset on and assumed the start positions. The music started playing again and and they started to move.  
不知为何，明日香没有抗议。她只是戴上耳机，摆好起始姿势。音乐再次响起，他们开始动起来。_

_But… soon it went… wrong. Asuka's body began disobeying her, moving to a different song. A different beat. She turned her head to look at Shinji. Dull surprise found her when she saw Shinji was now a clattering wooden marionette, strings off his wrists and legs. "How's this?" The doll asked, "I'm leading now, Asuka."  
但…很快情况就…不对劲了。明日香的身躯开始不听使唤，随着另一首曲子，另一个节拍移动。她转头看向真嗣，当她发现真嗣已变成一个咔哒作响的木偶，手腕和腿上挂着断线时，不禁感到一阵迟钝的惊讶。“怎么样？”木偶问道，“现在是我领舞了，明日香。”_

_She caught a glimpse of wire off her own wrist, and looked up. Beyond the two marionette sticks in his hands, Shinji's expressionless face and large, dark, empty eyes stared down at her. "I'm leading now, Asuka." He said.  
她瞥见自己手腕上的细线，抬头望去。在真嗣手中的两根牵线木偶棒之外，他那张毫无表情的脸庞和深邃、黑暗、空洞的双眼正俯视着她。“现在由我来引导，明日香。”他说道。_

_With horror she looked at the audience. Misato, Hikari, the stooges, and first had been turned into a single flat wooden cut out. Smiles were frozen on their faces.  
她惊恐地望向观众。碇真嗣、明日香、使徒们，以及最初的一切，都变成了单一的扁平木制剪影。他们脸上的笑容凝固了。_

_She looked at her limbs but realized they were still flesh. Somehow that gave her the knowledge to apply her will, resist the commands, and grab the cables on her limbs. "N-no!" She screamed, taking and pulling them hard.  
她审视着自己的四肢，意识到它们仍是血肉之躯。不知何故，这让她明白了如何运用意志，抵抗命令，并抓住四肢上的电缆。“不——！”她尖叫着，用力拽扯那些电缆。_

_A breathy exhale from Shinji wafted over her from above, but she was standing on her own now. She turned to see the Shinji marionette also standing by itself.  
真嗣轻柔的呼吸声从上方飘来，但她现在已能独自站立。她转身一看，发现真嗣的提线木偶也正自立着。_

_With rage she swung the collected cables in her hands. They careened as if underwater, slamming into the Shinji doll and knocking him over like scattered bowling pins. But just as she smiled in triumph, the doll reassembled itself. It snapped back into place, with Shinji's voice speaking as if over a phone. "I'm sorry."  
她满腔怒火地挥舞着手中的电缆，它们如同在水下般摇摆不定，猛地击中真嗣玩偶，将其打得四散倒地，犹如散落的保龄球瓶。然而，正当她得意微笑之际，玩偶竟自行重组，啪的一声恢复原位，真嗣的声音透过电话般传来：“对不起。”_

_She swung the cables again and the result repeated. She released the cables, crossed the distance, then seized the head of the Shinji doll and pulled hard.  
她再次挥动电缆，结果再次重现。她松开电缆，跨过距离，然后抓住真嗣玩偶的头部用力一拉。_

_"I'm… swowrrrryyyy-" the doll groaned before the head popped off. The marionette came apart, all the pieces collapsing and slowly phasing into different colors of pure form.  
“我…对…对不…起——”玩偶呻吟着，头颅随即脱落。那提线木偶支离破碎，所有部件纷纷崩解，缓缓转变为各种纯色形态。_

_Asuka was surrounded by these scattered pieces, which now were growing and shifting into different shinji-shaped silhouettes. The head that Asuka held still remained a head, though she could feel now the soft flesh and heavy skull of a_ real _detached head. She stared at it in horror._  
明日香被这些散落的碎片包围，它们正逐渐生长并变幻成不同形态的碇真嗣轮廓。她手中紧握的头颅依旧保持着头的形态，但她能感受到那真实的、脱离身体的柔软肌肤与沉重颅骨。她惊恐地凝视着它。

_"I'm sorry Asuka." It said.  
"对不起，明日香。" 它说道。_

_Somehow Asuka still had her wits enough to respond to the head, "It's not enough for you to say it, idiot! What are you doing to make it right?"  
不知怎的，明日香仍保持足够的理智回应头部，"光说对不起有什么用，笨蛋！你打算怎么弥补？"_

_From her right, a blue form of Shinji said, "No matter what I do it won't be good enough for you."  
从她的右边，一个蓝色的身影，是真嗣，他说道，"无论我做什么，对你来说都不够好。"_

_From her left, a golden form said, "I want to, but I don't know how. You won't tell me."  
从她左边，一个金色的身影说道：“我想，但我不知道怎么做。你又不告诉我。”_

_From behind her, a red form shaped like him in his plugsuit said with spayed arms, "I shouldn't have to! Why do I have to give in when it's YOUR fault,_ second_!"_  
从她身后，一个红色身影，形似他穿着插入栓服的样子，双臂交叉说道：“我本不该如此！明明是你的错，为何我要让步，第二！”

_From ahead of her, the naked outline of Shinji seemed to have its hands folded. "Please stay! Don't leave me alone! Help me, Asuka, I'm hurting!"  
在她前方，真嗣赤裸的轮廓似乎双手交叠。“请留下！别丢下我一个人！帮帮我，明日香，我很难受！”_

_"I'm sorry." The head said again in her lap.  
"对不起。" 那颗头颅再次在她膝上说道。_

_The voices all continued at once then, growing in volume as each of these figures and more were closing in on her with hands outstretched.  
随后，所有的声音同时继续响起，随着这些身影和更多人的逼近，他们的手伸向她，声音也越来越大。_

_Asuka, fearful, looked around wildly at the figures and in a panic, threw Shinji's head towards the golden form as she screamed_ herself awake and sat bolt upright in the bed.  
明日香惊恐地四处张望，慌乱中将真嗣的头颅抛向那金色身影，尖叫着从梦中惊醒，猛地坐直在床上。

Light was in her unlit room and she whirled to the door.  
昏暗的房间里透进了光亮，她急忙转向门口。

She had left it open. Beyond, a golden silhouette of Shinji was radiant and shining. Other colored duplicates radiated out and away from this golden shape like video artifacts. She saw the head move identically on all of them, looking up at her.  
她忘记关门了。门外，一个金色的真嗣轮廓熠熠生辉，其他彩色的复制品从这金色身影向外辐射，如同视频中的伪影。她看到所有头颅同步地抬起，望向她。

Her instinct was to grab her pillow and throw it at the intruder. Her aim was perfect and the pillow sailed at the apparition, which winked out just before contact, and returned Asuka to a mundane room.  
她的本能反应是抓起枕头朝闯入者扔去。她的准头极佳，枕头朝着那幽灵般的身影飞去，就在即将触碰之际，那身影倏地消失，又将明日香带回了平凡的房间。

She panted loud and hard from the intense dream, and tried to make sense of what just occurred. It must have been a lucid part of her dreaming, since there wasn't anything there now. She retrieved her pillow, shut the door, and for good measure kicked the blanket back in place.  
她因那场激烈的梦境而大口喘息，试图理清刚刚发生的一切。那必定是她梦境中的清醒时刻，因为此刻那里已空无一物。她取回枕头，关上门，还不忘将毯子踢回原位。

She didn't sleep well the rest of the night.  
那一夜剩下的时间她睡得并不安稳。

---

The next morning was gray and overcast. If the old media predating the second impact was to be believed, she would almost expect to see snowfall soon. Not that it would make her feel any better.  
次日清晨，天空灰蒙蒙的，阴云密布。如果相信第二次冲击前那些老旧媒体的报道，她几乎可以预见不久后雪花纷飞的景象。但这并不会让她感觉好些。

She didn't have energy for much today other than to veg out in front of the TV, eating snacks. It was a tuesday, two days before her birthday. She doubted anyone would remember- certainly not Misato. She might get an international call from Germany from her father, or more likely her stepmother, trying to convey well wishing. She might feel better after that.  
今天她除了瘫在电视机前吃零食，实在提不起劲做其他事。那天是周二，离她的生日还有两天。她怀疑没人会记得——当然不包括美里。她可能会接到来自德国的父亲或更可能是继母的国际电话，试图传达祝福。或许那样她会感觉好些。

Breakfast was the usual eggs and rice. She stared into space as She considered the malaise which gripped her, and again wondered why she couldn't just escape.  
早餐依旧是鸡蛋和米饭。她望着空茫，思索着困扰自己的倦怠感，再次疑惑为何自己就是无法逃离。

It was all Shinji's fault.  
这都是真嗣的错。

Because of him, Misato didn't need her. She had her darling surrogate son who was sad and needy and dependent and supportive. Codependency was coded up and down between those two. She was just a third wheel.  
因为他，碇真嗣不再需要她。她有了亲爱的养子，那个悲伤、渴望依赖又给予支持的孩子。他们之间充满了相互依赖的代码。她只是个多余的第三者。

NERV needed her to pilot unit 02, but maybe not for much longer. The dummy plug demonstrated that an Eva didn't need a pilot, unless that pilot wanted to be a hero and save the day. Asuka's days as a pilot were numbered.  
NERV 需要她驾驶二号机，但可能不会太久了。模拟插入栓的演示表明，除非驾驶员想成为英雄拯救世界，否则 EVA 并不需要真正的驾驶员。明日香的驾驶员生涯即将结束。

Father didn't need her. Mother didn't need her. Hikari was just getting along fine without her.  
父亲不需要她。母亲不需要她。光也完全可以没有她。

Shinji didn't need her. 真嗣不需要她。

_That's not true,_ he said.  
那不是真的，他说。

She blinked. Awareness came back to her from realizing something _happened_. She sat up from the folding chair, then stood, aware that something changed, but not sure _what_.  
她眨了眨眼，意识从某种发生的事情中回归。她从折叠椅上坐起，随即站起身，感觉到有什么变化，却又说不清是什么。

Stepping cautiously for her room she remembered all the odd occurrences she had seen over the past month. She had dismissed these things as just her idle imagination before, but for some reason it felt different this time.  
她小心翼翼地走向自己的房间，脑海中浮现出过去一个月里目睹的所有怪异事件。之前她总是把这些事情当作自己闲暇时的胡思乱想，但这次不知为何感觉不同了。

She had this feeling before. _Something_ was _coming_.  
她以前也有过这种感觉。有什么东西即将来临。

She couldn't tell how, or why, or where from, but that feeling of anticipation was certain. She tried to shake it off as she walked to her room, telling herself again it was something about being cooped up. She was imagining things.  
她说不清这种期待感是如何、为何、从何而来，但它的确凿无疑。她一边走向房间，一边试图摆脱这种感觉，再次告诉自己，这不过是闷在屋里的错觉。她想多了。

The sky darkened outside.  
外面的天空暗了下来。

She stared at the sheer curtains in her room. The change of lighting gave her a notion. She had to leave. She had to leave _now_.  
她凝视着房间里的薄纱窗帘。光线的变化给了她一个念头。她必须离开。她必须现在就离开。

In her room she threw off her shorts and shirt. She slipped on the first thing she could find- that one piece light blue sleeveless dress, and grabbed a jacket. Socks on, she hurried for the door with wide steps, making it to the kitchen before she realized she didn't have her A10 connectors in her hair.  
在她的房间里，她脱掉了短裤和衬衫。她随手抓起第一件能找到的衣服——那件浅蓝色无袖连衣裙，又抓起一件夹克。穿上袜子，她大步流星地向门口赶去，直到厨房才意识到自己没把 A10 连接器别在头发上。

She hesitated there and turned to look back at the way she came and froze.  
她在那里犹豫了一下，回头望向自己来时的路，然后愣住了。

Sitting against the rim of the door frame, like he did that night in October, was Shinji. The apparition was vague everywhere but his face, the features clearly defined away from the golden haze. His silhouette suggested he was wearing house clothes.  
倚靠在门框边缘，如同十月那晚一样，是真嗣的身影。除了他的面容，其余部分都显得模糊不清，五官在金色光晕中清晰可辨。他的轮廓暗示着他穿着家居服。

Asuka held her breath in her throat, staring wide-eyed, as Shinji smiled at her. "Hi." He said.  
明日香屏住呼吸，瞪大眼睛望着，因为真嗣正对她微笑。“嗨。”他说道。

The apparition stood up from the door frame, shining bright as the rest of the world had darkened. His form demanded attention, she had no choice but to stare. He held his ground, smiling a little at her.  
幽灵从门框中站起，光芒四射，仿佛世界其他地方都已暗淡。他的身影引人注目，她别无选择，只能凝视。他坚守原地，对她微微一笑。

"What…" she demanded, "what is this? What the hell are you!?"  
"这是…" 她质问道，"这是什么？你到底是什么东西！？"

Shinji started to approach, saying, "im not sure-" he stopped as Asuka took a step back in fear. He lowered his head. "I'm frightening you. I don't want to do that."  
真嗣开始靠近，说道："我不确定——" 他停了下来，因为明日香因恐惧后退了一步。他低下头。"我吓到你了。我不想那样做。"

Asuka's wide eyes were trained in the apparition's face. His tone and word choice was too articulated to be Shinji… but somehow, she knew this was Shinji.  
明日香的眼睛睁得大大的，紧盯着那幻影的面庞。他的语气和措辞太过清晰，不可能是真嗣……但不知为何，她知道这就是真嗣。

"What are you?" She asked again. Her upset over his ambiguity slammed into place, and the concussion blasted out of her face, "No more vague fucking answers, Third! Are you a ghost?"  
“你到底是什么？”她再次问道。她对真嗣含糊其辞的不满猛然爆发，脸上的表情如同受到冲击波一般，“别再给老子含糊其辞了，第三！你是鬼魂吗？”

"I… I guess so." The golden Shinji said, looking at his hands. Then he looked at her again. "I wanted to see you again. I wanted to talk to you before I said goodbye."  
“我……我想是的。”金色真嗣说着，看着自己的双手。然后他又看向她，“我想再见你一面。我想在告别前和你谈谈。”

"Goodbye?"Asuka repeated, then violently shook her head, "this is some kind of fucked up crowning moment of glory isn't it? You're back from the dead to tell _me_ something?"  
"再见？"明日香重复道，随后猛烈地摇头，"这算什么？你死而复生就为了告诉我点什么？这简直是荒谬至极的荣耀时刻吧？"

"That's right." "对，没错。"

"Well, what is it, oh magnanimous Shinji-sama?"  
"那么，是什么事呢，伟大的真嗣大人？"

"I liked you." Shinji replied.  
"我喜欢你。" 真嗣回答道。

Asuka stepped back, a little beside herself at this revelation. She would have been ready to lay into him with a challenge to prove it, but doubt was on her mind considering his volcano jump.  
明日香后退一步，被这个真相震惊得有些失态。她本想向他发起挑战，要求证明这一点，但考虑到他那火山一跃，心中不免生出疑虑。

Before she could overcome being startled and continue to challenge, Shinji went on, "im in a strange place now, i don't know where I am or how I'm able to do this. It took me a while to get here, I'm sorry."  
在她还没来得及平复惊吓继续挑战时，真嗣接着说道：“我现在身处一个奇怪的地方，不知道自己在哪儿，也不知道怎么做到的。我花了些时间才到这里，抱歉。”

Asuka gazed at him skeptically. "You're…still in the eva?"  
明日香怀疑地盯着他。“你……还在 EVA 里？”

"Yes. And… and I think I'm there to stay. My mother is calling me… very soon I'm going to join her. But I didn't want to leave just yet, because I wanted to see you again. I wanted to tell you that I liked you, before I left for good."  
"是的。而且…我想我会留在那里。我母亲在召唤我…很快我就要去与她团聚了。但我不想就这样离开，因为我还想再见你一面。我想在永远离开之前告诉你，我喜欢你。"

Asuka wasn't sure which she found harder to believe- that Shinji was communicating to her from the Evangelion, or that he liked her after all. There was a third possibility- that the isolation was finally getting to her- but she decided then to choose the possibility she wanted to believe.  
明日香不确定哪件事更难以置信——是真嗣从 EVA 里与她交流，还是他终究喜欢她。还有第三种可能——那就是孤独终于开始影响她了——但她决定选择她愿意相信的那种可能。

"Ok, so how long did you know you liked me?"  
好的，那你喜欢我这件事，你意识到有多久了？

Shinji shrugged. "Since the training. But I thought you were cute on the carrier too. I was happy you were a pilot, because I got to see you more and fight beside you." He smiled again, "when you moved in with us, I couldn't believe my luck."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“自从训练以来。但我在航母上就觉得你很可爱。我很高兴你也是飞行员，因为这样我就能更多地见到你，与你并肩作战。”他再次微笑，“当你搬来和我们一起住时，我简直不敢相信自己的好运。”

Asuka stared at him incredulous. She stepped forward. "The walls of Jericho," she advanced again, "My swimsuit. The kiss in _this very room_!" She swept a hand, "why are you feeding me _such bullshit, third_!? If you liked me then why didn't you _do anything_!?"  
明日香难以置信地盯着他，向前迈了一步。“耶利哥之墙，”她再次逼近，“我的泳装。就在这个房间里的吻！”她挥手质问，“你为什么要对我撒这种谎，第三！？如果你喜欢我，为什么什么都没做！？”

"Because you would hate me, and leave if i tried." The serene, gilden image of Shinji said, unaffected by Asuka's barrage. "You were just teasing me the whole time, calling me a pervert. And since I didn't want to do anything to prove that was true, even in the slightest. Besides," his head dipped a little, "You really gave it to me when you learned I tried to kiss you the other night. I vowed never to do anything that would offend you again, No matter how much I liked you. I would just… admire you from afar. Where it was safe."  
"因为如果你知道真相，你会恨我，会离开我。" 真嗣那平静而金色的影像说道，丝毫不受明日香连珠炮似的攻击影响。"你一直都在逗我，叫我变态。我不想做任何事来证实这一点，哪怕是一点点。而且，" 他的头微微低垂，"当你得知我那晚试图吻你时，你真的对我很生气。我发誓再也不做任何冒犯你的事，无论我多么喜欢你。我只会……远远地欣赏你。在安全的地方。"

Asuka blinked. "If you mean jack off to me when you think I wouldn't hear you, that's not 'admiring'."  
明日香眨了眨眼。“如果你指的是趁我听不见时对我自慰，那不叫‘欣赏’。”

"Oh." The Shinji image said, "I didn't… think you'd know."  
“哦。”那个真嗣形象说道，“我没想到……你会知道。”

"With how thin these walls are?" Asuka replied and stepped forward again. Now she was in arms reach. "So that's it, huh? You tell me you like me and then just… die?"  
"就因为这墙这么薄？" 明日香回答着，再次向前迈步，现在她已经近在咫尺。"原来如此，你告诉我你喜欢我，然后就这样……死了？"

"Yeah." Shinji said with a small smile again. "And that… i'm sorry… I wasn't around to make you something for your birthday."  
"嗯。" 真嗣再次露出一丝微笑，"还有……对不起……你生日那天我没能陪在你身边为你做点什么。"

"You knew?" 你知道？

"Yeah. I was counting down the days so I could surprise you. Though," his eyes dropped, "I don't think I can come up with anything you would like."  
是啊，我一直在倒数日子，想给你一个惊喜。不过，"他的目光垂下，"我觉得我可能想不出什么你会喜欢的东西。

Asuka stared level at the apparition. Assuming this was Shinji, she had been just given a lot to think about, but if he was correct, she didn't have a lot of time to act on it.  
明日香目光平直地盯着那幻影。如果这真是真嗣，她刚刚得到了许多需要深思的信息，但如果他是对的，她就没有太多时间去行动了。

Or did she? 还是她并没有？

"No." She said, her expression holding level disgust.  
"不。" 她回答道，脸上带着平静的厌恶。

"Yeah, I didn't think s-"  
"嗯，我没想到……"

"No. Not that." Asuka said. She crossed her arms. "You're not leaving. You're coming back here."  
"不，不是那个。" 明日香说。她交叉双臂。"你不是要走。你是要回到这里来。"

The golden Shinji stared at her. "Uh… I can't. Didn't I tell you? Im still in the Eva. I am just a projection."  
金色的真嗣凝视着她。“呃……我做不到。我不是告诉过你吗？我还被困在 EVA 里。我只是一个投影。”

"I don't care." Asuka uttered, "you don't get to tell me all of this, then ditch me to go to some kind of afterlife, _hero_. You're coming back here."  
“我不在乎。”明日香说道，“你没资格告诉我这一切，然后抛下我去什么来世，英雄。你要回到这里来。”

The serene Shinji looked sad. "I don't want to go but… I can't stay. My mother is calling me, I'll be joining her soon."  
平静的真嗣看起来很悲伤。“我不想走，但是…我不能留下。我母亲在召唤我，我很快就会与她团聚。”

Asuka's pupils stared directly into his. "You sound like you don't want to go."  
明日香的瞳孔直视着他的。“你听起来好像并不想去。”

"I… I don't but…" Shinji uttered, "I'm scared. To say no."  
“我…我不想，但是…”真嗣低声说，“我害怕。拒绝。”

Asuka raised her face. "Do you need my help?"  
明日香抬起头。“需要我帮忙吗？”

Shinji stared a moment, then said, "You don't have to-"  
真嗣凝视了一会儿，然后说：“你不必——”

"Answer my question." “回答我的问题。”

Shinji hesitated, then cringed a little as he said, "yes…"  
绫波犹豫了一下，随后略带畏缩地说：“是的…”

"I'll help you." She said, "And you'll owe me for this."  
“我会帮你的。”她说，“你可欠我一个人情了。”

He smiled again. "Seeing you again… would be… worth it…"  
他再次微笑。“再次见到你……会……值得的……”

The golden image had started to fade. Asuka kept her eyes trained on Shinji's, until he had vanished.  
那金色的影像开始消退。明日香一直盯着真嗣的眼睛，直到他完全消失。

Once the vision was gone, the world was lightened again. Everything in that trashed apartment sat as it should.  
幻象消失后，世界再次明亮起来。那间破败公寓里的一切都恢复了原位。

She sighed. "Of course you would bail before telling me what it is I need to do, would you?"  
她叹了口气。“你当然会在告诉我需要做什么之前就溜之大吉，对吧？”

III. Descent
三、降临

Asuka descended to NERV for the first time in a month. They hadn't needed her all that time, her Eva was still being repaired. It was a miracle no angels came considering their timetable up until now.
明日香一个月来首次前往 NERV 总部。这段时间他们并不需要她，她的 Eva 仍在修复中。考虑到至今为止的时间表，没有使徒来袭简直是个奇迹。

As she rode the main elevator down, Asuka wondered to herself why she was doing this. There was no promise that the apparition Asuka witnessed was in fact Shinji. It may have been an Angel messing with her head, telling her what to believe.
当她乘坐主电梯下降时，明日香自问为什么要这么做。并没有保证明日香所见的幻象就是真嗣。可能是使徒在扰乱她的心智，告诉她该相信什么。

That didn't feel right though. An Angel would have appeared as Kaji, someone far more agreeable than some idiot like Shinji.
但那感觉不对。如果是使徒，它应该会变成加持的样子，一个比真嗣这种笨蛋更讨人喜欢的形象。

And what to do about this claim that he liked her, no matter how sound his reasons for hesitation were?
至于他声称喜欢她，无论他犹豫的理由多么充分，又该如何应对呢？

One way or another she'd sort it out. She had something to do now, instead of sitting around in that trashed apartment waiting for someone to put her out of her misery.
无论如何，她会解决这件事。现在她有事可做了，不必再坐在那间破败的公寓里，等待着有人来结束她的痛苦。

The elevator announced it was in the base limits now, soon she'd be at the end of the line. She winced as she glared at the floor indicator.
电梯提示已到达最低层，很快她就会到达终点。她皱着眉头，盯着楼层指示器，不禁感到一阵痛楚。

"Okay Shinji." She uttered as the elevator clicked down into the depths of the earth. "I'm coming, hero."
“好的，真嗣。”她低声说道，电梯缓缓下降至地底深处。“我来了，英雄。”

Misato had watched the lines, cables, and connections attached to unit 01 grow more complicated over time. She had hoped with the complexity there would be more understanding of the stakes of recovering Shinji. That moment never came, leaving her isolated among the staffers trying to figure out the problem.
随着时间的推移，碇真嗣所在的零号机上的线路、电缆和连接变得越来越复杂，葛城美里一直在观察。她曾希望这种复杂性能够带来对营救真嗣所面临风险的更多理解。然而，那一刻始终没有到来，使她孤立无援地与试图解决问题的其他工作人员一起。

But it was better than going home to face an angry teenager that hated her. After her sole attempt to reach Asuka was flatly rejected, the woman stopped trying, mostly out of a sense of powerlessness. She had no idea how to reach Asuka, as if there was anything to the connection before she and Kaji hooked up again. The only consolation Misato had over the month on the base was the cheap beer stocked in some of the break rooms.
但这总比回家面对一个憎恨她的愤怒青少年要好。自从唯一一次尝试与明日香沟通却遭到冷淡拒绝后，这位女士便停止了尝试，很大程度上是因为感到无能为力。她不知道如何接近明日香，仿佛在她和加持再次走到一起之前，她们之间就没什么联系。美里在基地度过的一个月里唯一的慰藉，就是休息室里存放的廉价啤酒。

Misato looked out of the windows of the management office for this cage and down upon Evangelion 01. The entry plug had been ejected, anticipating a new recovery effort to reconstitute Shinji within the plug and into his plugsuit adrift in the capsule.
葛城美里从管理办公室的窗户望出去，俯瞰着下方的初号机。插入栓已经被弹出，准备进行新一轮的恢复工作，以将真嗣重组进插入栓内，并使其漂浮在胶囊中的驾驶服中。

Ritsuko said from behind her then as the doctor worked at a console, "Seeing it through to the end, huh?"
律子从她身后说道，同时医生在控制台前忙碌着，“坚持看到最后，是吧？”

"Something like that." Misato said.
“差不多吧。”美里回答。

Ritsuko said nothing else, keeping followup comments to herself. Maya interrupted her thinking just then. "Doctor? Fluctuations on the RRS charts are increasing."
律子没有再说什么，把后续的评论留在了心里。就在那时，玛雅打断了她的思绪。“医生？RRS 图表上的波动正在增加。”

Ritsuko wheeled her chair over to Maya's desk. "That's the third one. Put a track on it."
律子将椅子推到真緒的桌旁。“这是第三个了。给它做个追踪。”

Misato asked over her shoulder, "Does that mean anything?"
美里侧过头问道：“那有什么意义吗？”

"No." Ritsuko said. "It's a side effect of the S2 organ. We've been documenting it as it occurs, but otherwise it doesn't mean anything."
“没有。”律子说，“这是 S2 器官的副作用。我们一直在记录发生的情况，但除此之外它并没有什么意义。”

Misato didn't believe that answer, but she stayed quiet. Arms crossed she looked back out at the Evangelion and had to do a double take. "Asuka?"
美里并不相信这个回答，但她保持沉默。双臂交叉，她再次望向那台福音战士，不得不再次确认。“明日香？”

The redhead, in her plugsuit, was walking along the nape gantry in front of the unit. Misato's first thought was wondering how she got through security, but she dismissed it as she remembered security was lifted days ago when the unit was proven dormant.
那位红发少女，身穿插入栓服，正沿着机甲后颈部的走道行走。美里的第一反应是疑惑她如何通过安全检查，但随即想起，自从该机甲被证实休眠后，几天前安全措施已经解除。

Her next thought was to wonder what Asuka was doing there.
她的下一个念头是好奇明日香在那里做什么。

Asuka stopped just beneath the jaw of the Evangelion. The last time she was this close to Shinji's unit was when the two of them crash landed after the synchronous dance. She didn't care much for the gaudy mask that adorned the face. Being this close though, unsettled her.
明日香停在了初号机的下巴下方。上次她这么近距离接触真嗣的机体，还是在同步之舞后两人坠机时。她并不喜欢那张脸上装饰的华丽面具。然而，如此近距离地接触，让她感到不安。

Hands on hips, she said to it, "All right Shinji, I'm here. Now what?"
她双手叉腰，对着它说：“好吧，真嗣，我来了。现在怎么办？”

The unit sat mute, staring down at her. Asuka glared back, waiting for some kind of sign. She grunted then and scratched her head. "Figures," she uttered, "I go stick my neck out for him and he leaves me hanging. What am I doing?"
机体静静地坐着，低头凝视着她。明日香回瞪着，等待某种信号。她哼了一声，挠了挠头。“真是的，”她嘟囔道，“我为他冒险，他却让我悬着。我这是在干什么？”

Misato's voice carried down the gantry. "Asuka!" The redhead turned her head Misato approached. "What are you doing?"
碇司令的声音在通道中回荡：“明日香！”红发少女闻声回头，只见碇司令正向她走来。“你在做什么？”

Asuka turned to face Misato. Hundreds of excuses piled up behind her tongue were ready for launch; she wanted to gloat, she wanted to see Shinji's unit, she wanted to see this all for herself. Coming this far, though, she decided to skip any excuses and plough the truth as far as she could take it. "I'm here to rescue Shinji."
明日香转向面对美里。数百个借口堆积在她的舌尖，随时准备脱口而出；她想炫耀，她想看看真嗣的机体，她想亲眼目睹这一切。但走到这一步，她决定跳过任何借口，尽可能坦诚地说出真相。“我来是为了救出真嗣。”

Misato cocked an eyebrow. She slowly crossed her arms, "Okay, and just how do you propose to do this? Go in there and get him?"
美里挑了挑眉毛。她缓缓地交叉双臂，“好吧，那你打算怎么救他？直接进去把他带出来？”

That thought hadn't occurred to Asuka, and was one she found repellant. Enter his unit? Debase herself on another Evangelion? But somehow the more she considered it, the more strange sense it made. She would have to go and get him. That meant following him.
这个念头从未在明日香脑海中出现过，而且她觉得这很令人反感。进入他的机体？在另一台 Evangelion 上自降身份？但不知为何，她越是考虑，越觉得这有些奇怪的道理。她必须去找他。这意味着要跟随他。

She had to sell this idea to Misato since it seemed Asuka was Shinji's only hope. "That's exactly what I need to do. Is the entry plug ready?"
她得说服美里接受这个想法，因为似乎只有明日香能救真嗣了。“这正是我需要做的。插入栓准备好了吗？”

Misato blinked and shook her disbelieving head. "What makes you think you can just walk in here and take charge? Ritsuko has been working for a month to recover Shinji. Now you think you can do it? By yourself?"
美里眨了眨眼，难以置信地摇了摇头。“你凭什么认为你可以走进来就接管一切？律子已经努力了一个月来恢复真嗣。现在你认为你可以做到？独自一人？”

Confidence, Asuka the girl thought. "Exactly. Put me in his Eva."
自信，明日香心想。“正是如此。让我进入他的 Eva。”

Misato laughed once. "What? No! This has gone far enough Asuka. Maybe being stuck in that apartment has driven you-"
美里笑了一声。“什么？不！明日香，这已经太过分了。或许是被困在那间公寓里让你——”

She stopped then because alarms started to ring in the cages. Misato and Asuka looked around and saw technicians- and Ritsuko- running across the gantry to the back of the unit.
她随即停下，因为警报开始在笼子里响起。美里和明日香环顾四周，看到技术人员——还有律子——正跑过步道，向单元后方奔去。

Misato and Asuka exchanged glances before running up to join them.
碇真嗣和明日香交换了一个眼神，然后跑上前去加入他们。

On the load platform, just under the heavily connected entry plug, Shinji's plugsuit floated on a stream of LCL. Misato and Ritsuko, along with the other technicians, watched in surprise and dismay as their work was undone.
在装载平台上，就在紧密连接的插入栓下方，真嗣的驾驶服漂浮在 LCL 的细流中。葛城美里和律子，以及其他技术人员，惊讶而沮丧地看着他们的工作被破坏。

But Asuka just stared at the plug, fists clenched, her mind made up. She was going to go get Shinji.
但明日香只是盯着插入栓，拳头紧握，心意已决。她要去把真嗣带回来。

"Put me in there." She said and walked to the entry plug where Shinji was last seen.
"把我放进去。" 她说着，走向了碇真嗣最后出现的插入栓入口。

It was surreal to board a Evangelion that wasn't her own. She could feel it, from the handholds to the seat pad to the surrounding walls. She told herself it was because this was a prototype. A Japanese unit. An inferior model.
登上一个不是自己的 EVA，感觉很不可思议。她能感受到，从抓手到座椅垫，再到周围的墙壁。她告诉自己，这是因为这是一台原型机。一台日本制造的。一个低劣的型号。

But hers wasn't the Evangelion to eat an angel.
但她的 EVA 并不是用来吞噬使徒的。

She swallowed her nervousness down as she sat in Shinji's chair and the plug hatch closed over her. Ritsuko had given hesitant approval for this operation only because there was literally nothing left. Expelling the original LCL obliterated the one operation plan she had on pilot recovery at this stage. And considering the Evangelion reacted to Asuka's presence and suggestion, they went along with it.
她咽下紧张，坐在真嗣的驾驶座上，插入栓的舱门随之关闭。律子犹豫地批准了这次行动，只因已别无选择。排空原有的 LCL 摧毁了她在这个阶段唯一的驾驶员恢复操作计划。考虑到初号机对明日香的接近和提议有所反应，他们便决定尝试。

Asuka didn't know what she was doing, but she chose to be here when offered. Now she had to take whatever came at her. "Ready." She breathed in the plug.
明日香并不清楚自己在做什么，但当机会来临时，她选择了参与。现在，她必须面对即将到来的一切。“准备好了。”她在插入栓中深吸一口气。

Misato's voice said after a moment, "Good luck, Asuka."
片刻后，传来碇真嗣的声音：“祝你好运，明日香。”

The redhead adjusted her posture. She felt the familiar sensation of boarding an Eva- the entry plug ramming into the Evangelion and the LCL filling up. As it did she could smell Shinji's stink; the particular, nervous body odor she picked up from him even as far back as standing beside him on the carrier bridge. And now she was doing to rescue that confusing idiot.
红发少女调整了坐姿，感受到搭乘 Eva 的熟悉感觉——插入栓猛地嵌入福音战士，LCL 液体逐渐充满。随着液体的充盈，她能闻到真嗣的汗味；那种特有的、紧张的体味，早在航母桥上站在他身边时就已察觉。而现在，她正要去救那个让人捉摸不透的笨蛋。

"Prepare start-up sequence." Ritusko's voice said in her ears. "Begin."
"准备启动序列。" 里图斯科的声音在她耳边响起，"开始。"

Asuka clenched the handles. She had heard about the cross-synchronization tests, but was relieved to know she wouldn't be considered for them, and neither Shinji nor first would be put into her Evangelion. She had heard from Shinji that the two successfully cross-synched, but she always wondered- in spite of denying any interest- how she would have done. She was about to find out.
明日香紧握着把手。她听说过交叉同步测试，但得知自己不会被考虑参与其中，真嗣和第一适格者也不会被安排进她的 EVA，她感到一阵宽慰。她从真嗣那里听说两人成功实现了交叉同步，尽管她一直否认对此有任何兴趣，但内心总忍不住好奇——如果是她，结果会如何。现在，她即将揭晓答案。

"Beginning phase 3 connections," Ritsuko said, "interlinking A10 connectors."
"开始第三阶段连接，" 律子说道，"互联 A10 接头。"

Asuka blinked and suddenly the world was dark. She was floating in the air, a soundless void surrounded her. She looked at the backs of her hands, spun them to the front. She moved, coming out of the reclined position to stand in… wherever this was.
明日香眨了眨眼，突然世界变得一片漆黑。她漂浮在空中，四周是无声的虚空。她看着自己手的背面，翻转过来。她移动身体，从半躺的姿势站起身来，站在这个不知名的地方。

"Misato?" She asked the void. "Doctor Akagi?"
“美里？”她向虚空问道，“赤木博士？”

Nothing. Only a quiet just of distant wind answered her. She clenched her fists. "Okay, Shinji. I'm here. Where are you?"
没有任何回应。只有远处微弱的微风声回答了她。她紧握双拳，“好吧，真嗣。我在这里。你在哪儿？”

Asuka found herself again standing over First, in that fleeting chance to befriend Rei on her own terms at school. It felt like a dream… but a dream where she was aware, conscious.
明日香发现自己再次站在第一的上方，在学校里有机会按照自己的条件与绫波成为朋友。这感觉像是一场梦……但一场她意识清醒的梦。

As Rei stared at her book, she asked, "Who are you?"
绫波盯着她的书，问道：“你是谁？”

"Asuka Soryu Langley, Second children." Asuka replied as she stood above her. "Now where's Shinji? I'm here to bring him back."
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。”明日香站在她上方回答道。“现在，真嗣在哪里？我是来带他回去的。”

"How did you imagine you would accomplish that?" Rei replied. She turned a page, "Did you think you would be a hero by coming here to save him all by yourself? Why are you really here?"
"你怎么想象你能做到那一点？" 绫波回应道。她翻过一页，"你以为独自来这里救他就能成为英雄吗？你真正来这里的原因是什么？"

Asuka blinked, back in her plugsuit and in the void. "What other reason do I need? That idiot got himself stuck here and said he needed my help. So I'm here to get him."
明日香眨了眨眼，穿着插入栓服，身处虚空之中。"还需要什么其他理由吗？那个笨蛋自己陷在这里，说他需要我的帮助。所以我来带他出去。"

Rei, also in her plugsuit, said, "You're really here to learn if his feelings were sincere when he confessed to you."
同样穿着插入栓服的绫波说："你真正来这里是为了验证他向你表白时，他的感情是否真诚。"

Asuka flinched, then blasted defensively, "What difference does that make? Either way I'm here to bring him out. Are you going to help me, or not?"
明日香一惊，随即防御性地反击道：“那有什么区别？反正我来这里就是为了把他带出去。你到底帮不帮我？”

Asuka was sitting in a train, now, in the deep evening. She was looking into the almost setting sun on the horizon. Someone sat opposite of her, about half her size. A girl with ribbons holding up big pigtails. A vision of her when she found mama.
此刻，明日香坐在夜色渐深的火车上，凝视着地平线上几乎落下的夕阳。对面坐着一个人，大约只有她一半大小。那是一个用丝带扎着大马尾辫的女孩。这是她找到妈妈时的情景。

The girl asked, "Why do you want to help him? He's done so much to hurt you. He's taken away so much. Your dignity. Your sync ratio. Your first kiss. What has he offered you in return?"
女孩问道：“你为什么要帮他？他给你带来了那么多伤害。他夺走了你的尊严，你的同步率，你的初吻。他又给了你什么回报呢？”

"I don't know," Asuka said, averting her eyes. These were all very valid reasons to abandon Shinji... but… she didn't want to leave him here. And that's not why she boarded the Eva to come after him. "He cooks and cleans the apartment without me asking."
"我不知道，"明日香说着，移开了视线。这些都是抛弃真嗣的充分理由……但是……她不想把他留在这里。而且，这并不是她登上 Eva 来找他的原因。"他会做饭，打扫公寓，我都没要求过。"

"Because I told him to do it." An image of Misato said, off-frame. "He does everything he's told to do. It's how he survives."
"因为我让他这么做的。"画面外，美里形象地说，"他做所有被告知的事情。这就是他生存的方式。"

Asuka stared. "Misato didn't order him those other times."
明日香瞪大了眼睛。“以前那些时候，美里并没有命令他。”

Evangelion 01's arm plunged downward to seize Asuka in the lava.
初号机的手臂猛地向下探去，试图在熔岩中抓住明日香。

She roused the other morning to find herself on his cot and Shinji sleeping a distance away. Her first thought was surprise she was there. The next was gratitude that the dork hadn't taken advantage of her during the night.
她清晨醒来时，发现自己躺在他的小床上，而真嗣则在不远处熟睡。她的第一个念头是惊讶自己怎么会在这里。紧接着，她感到庆幸，那个呆子没有趁她熟睡时占她便宜。

"I like you." “我喜欢你。”

The little girl said, "He has disappointed you so many times though."
小女孩说：“尽管他让你失望了那么多次。”

The door closed to Misato's room. Asuka's lips were pressed against his, waiting for something. Anything. She leaned in close, keenly aware that one zipper pull was all that was needed to free her breasts for him. He did nothing.
门关上了，通往碇真嗣的房间。明日香的嘴唇紧贴着他的，等待着什么。任何东西。她靠得很近，敏锐地意识到只需要一个拉链就能让他看到她的胸部。他什么也没做。

The little girl said, "So why do you help him? Why are you here? What does he mean to you?"
小女孩问道：“那你为什么还要帮他？你为什么在这里？他对你意味着什么？”

Asuka shook her head. "That's none of your business! That's between me and him!"
明日香摇了摇头。“这不关你的事！这是我和他之间的事！”

Rei, clad in the plugsuit, stared contemptuously at her.
身着驾驶服的绫波丽冷冷地盯着她。

Now Asuka was sitting at the table in Misato's apartment. It was October.
此刻，明日香正坐在美里公寓的餐桌旁。时值十月。

Her fingers tapped on the table, idly. "Hey, Shinji," she said, "Do you want to kiss?"
她的手指在桌上随意地敲打着。“嘿，真嗣，”她说，“你想接吻吗？”

Shinji looked up from his manga. Then he pulled his ear buds out to be certain he had heard her right. "What?"
真嗣从他的漫画书中抬起头，然后摘下耳塞，确保自己没有听错。“什么？”

"A kiss. A kiss! You've never kissed, right?" She asked, leaning up in the seat at the dining table.
"一个吻。一个吻！你从没接过吻，对吧？" 她问道，在餐桌旁的座位上倾身向前。

Shinji shook his head in answer to her question. "No."
真嗣摇头回答她的问题。“不。”

"Then let's kiss." Asuka said.
“那我们就接吻吧。”明日香说道。

"Why?" He asked her. “为什么？”他问她。

"Because I'm bored." She replied.
"因为我无聊。" 她回答道。

He looked at her skeptically. "That's a terrible reason to kiss."
他怀疑地看着她。“那是个糟糕的接吻理由。”

Asuka leaned back in the chair. "Not like there's anything else to do." She smirked wickedly, "Or are you saying you're scared to kiss a pretty girl like me?"
明日香靠在椅背上，懒洋洋地说：“反正也没别的事可做。”她邪魅一笑，“还是说，你害怕亲吻像我这样的漂亮女孩？”

"I'm not scared!" He said and came to his feet, "Come on, pucker up!"
“我才不怕呢！”他站起身来，“来吧，准备好亲吻吧！”

Asuka stood from the chair to join him. "Did you brush your teeth?"
明日香从椅子上站起来走向他，“你刷牙了吗？”

"Yeah I did." Shinji said and came closer. "Are you ready?" He asked.
"嗯，我来了。" 真嗣说着走近了些，"你准备好了吗？" 他问道。

Standing less than a meter apart, she hesitated at his uncharacteristic boldness. "Okay, just a kiss, all right?"
相隔不到一米，她对他的异常大胆犹豫了。“好吧，就一个吻，行吗？”

"Do you want this or not?" Shinji replied, exasperated.
“你到底要不要？”真嗣回答道，显得有些恼火。

"Just setting the limits, Third!"
“只是设定界限，第三！”

"Now whose scared?" 现在谁害怕了？

"Shut up and let's do it!"
“闭嘴，咱们开始吧！”

Laughing, Shinji said, "Okay." And leaned in to grab her by the hips. Asuka swallowed as his face leaned in closer.
笑着，真嗣说：“好的。”然后倾身抓住了她的腰。当他的脸靠近时，明日香不由自主地咽了口口水。

"Wait," she said, hesitating further. "S-Stop breathing through your nose, it tickles…"
“等等，”她迟疑地说道，“别、别用鼻子呼吸了，好痒……”

"Stop giving excuses." Shinji uttered, then rammed his lips into hers. Asuka squirmed against the intrusion, and grunted again as his tongue breached her lips. She writhed against him, hands coming up to his chest to gently push him away, but he only pulled her in further.
“别再找借口了。”真嗣低声说道，随即猛地吻上她的唇。明日香挣扎着抵抗这突如其来的侵犯，当他的舌头突破她的唇齿时，她再次发出闷哼。她在他怀里扭动，双手抬起抵在他的胸前，试图轻轻推开他，但他却将她抱得更紧。

The scene froze. The lights clicked out, except for one spotlight illuminating the motionless couple, and one light illuminating Asuka in her plugsuit. "That's not Shinji. No way Shinji's that assertive, that's an imposter!"
场景定格。灯光熄灭，唯有一束聚光灯照亮静止不动的情侣，另一束光照亮了身穿插入栓服的明日香。“那不是真嗣。真嗣绝不会如此果断，那是冒牌货！”

Another spotlight clicked on. Rei, in her plugsuit. "This is the Shinji that you wanted that night in October. This is how that event would have begun with the Shinji you desired."
另一束聚光灯亮起，照亮了身穿插入栓服的绫波。“这就是你在十月那晚所渴望的真嗣。这是你期望的真嗣，那场事件本应如此开始。”

"No way! Shinji is more considerate! Gentle! I don't want this kind of Shinji!"
不可能！真嗣更体贴！温柔！我不想要这样的真嗣！

Rei smirked, "But you are unhappy with Shinji as he is in your life. What is it you want from him?"
绫波冷笑道：“但你对于真嗣出现在你生活中感到不满。你究竟想从他那里得到什么？”

Waves crashing on the beach, a placid scene.
海浪拍打着沙滩，一片宁静的景象。

"Is...is it so much to ask that the idiot be honest for once? Why does he have to be so indecisive? I want a straight answer for once about what HE wants! How does he see ME?"
难道要求这个傻瓜诚实一次就这么难吗？为什么他非得这么优柔寡断？我只想听一次他到底想要什么，他又是怎么看我的！

Shinji, in his plain school outfit in the void, said, "I told you, I like you."
真嗣身着朴素的校服，在虚空中说道：“我告诉过你，我喜欢你。”

Asuka shouted back, "And I've been flirting with you from day one, idiot! And you never did anything! So now that you're on death's door, do you really want me, or are you just saying that to tell me what I want to hear so I can remember you fondly?"
明日香反驳道：“我从第一天开始就在跟你调情，笨蛋！而你什么也没做！现在你快死了，你是真的想要我，还是只是为了说我想听的话，好让我能怀念你？”

Shinji blinked, astonished.
真嗣眨了眨眼，感到惊讶。

Rei, naked, winced as she frowned with disapproval.
裸身的绫皱着眉头，露出不悦的神情。

Night, Misato's apartment. Asuka collapses into the cot. Shinji's eyes peek, then blast open at seeing Asuka face to face with him. Asuka frowned at him and stared angrily into his eyes as they lay there.
夜晚，碇真嗣的公寓。明日香倒在床上。真嗣的眼睛偷偷瞄了一眼，然后猛地睁大，因为他看到明日香正对着他。明日香皱着眉头，怒视着他的眼睛，两人就这样躺着。

The SDAT player clicked complete.
SDAT 播放器咔哒一声播放完毕。

Asuka took a breath, "How do I need to make it clearer to you, third, that I like you? You want a handmade invitation? A pat on the head? What do I need to get an honest answer out of you?"
明日香深吸一口气，“我还要怎样才能让你明白，第三，我喜欢你？要我亲手做个邀请函吗？还是拍拍你的头？我得怎么做才能从你那里得到一个真诚的回答？”

His eyes stared at her with no expression. "Just be nice to me." He said.
他的眼睛毫无表情地盯着她。“对我好一点。”他说。

"I am nice to you." She replied, and winced, "You think I dress the way I do at home for just anyone? You think I trust just anyone with my laundry or my meals? Why won't you read between the lines, Third?"
“我对你很好。”她回答道，皱了皱眉，“你以为我在家里穿成那样是为了谁？你以为我会随便让人碰我的衣物或餐食吗？你为什么就不能读懂我的言外之意，老三？”

His eyes averted from hers. "Why couldn't you just… talk to me? Why do you have to be so abrasive and contradictory?"
他的目光从她的身上移开。“你为什么就不能……直接跟我说话？为什么非要这么尖锐和矛盾？”

"Idiot," Asuka said, "You realize half the time I'm angry is because of something you said? Go ahead and offer me one of those insincere apologies again. I know you don't actually mean them. If you did, you'd actually try to make things better." Her eyes moved away from his, "You'd show me you cared."
"傻瓜，"明日香说，"你有没有意识到，我有一半时间生气都是因为你说了什么？来吧，再给我一个那种不真诚的道歉。我知道你不是真心的。如果你是，你会真正努力去改善情况。"她的目光从他的眼睛移开，"你会让我看到你在乎。"

"...I do care… but… it's like I said, I don't want to mess up. I don't want you to be angry with me. I'd do… anything to keep you from being angry with me."
“...我确实在乎…但是…就像我说的，我不想搞砸。我不想让你生我的气。我愿意…做任何事来避免你对我生气。”

Shinji blinked. He was on the back of his Evangelion now with the entry plug ejected. It was a clear day, he was wearing his plugsuit. Evangelion 01 was on top of Evangelion 02, right after their synchronized dancing battle.
真嗣眨了眨眼，此刻他正身处自己的初号机背部，插入栓已弹出。天空晴朗，他身着驾驶服。就在他们同步舞蹈对决之后，初号机正压在二号机之上。

The phone rang. 电话响了。

He opened the hatch and pulled out the phone. Before he could even speak, Asuka's voice blasted through, "Idiot! You're so afraid of failing at all that you won't try even once?!"
他打开舱门，掏出手机。还没来得及开口，明日香的声音就炸了过来：“笨蛋！你就是因为害怕失败，所以连一次尝试都不敢吗？！”

He looked around, and saw Asuka on the back of her unit. She spoke as her hologram did. "I can't count the number of times you've shot me down, but I keep trying because I'm dumb enough to believe you're interested in me when you tried to kiss me in the middle of the night! I almost gave up when you ignored me kissing you, but then you pull this stunt!"
他环顾四周，看到明日香正站在她的机体后部。她的全息影像也同步说话：“你拒绝我的次数我都数不清了，但我还是傻到相信你对我有意思，因为你曾在半夜试图吻我！当你无视我吻你的时候，我差点就放弃了，结果你又来这一出！”

"D-does that mean you do like me too?" He asked hesitantly.
“那……那是不是意味着你也喜欢我？”他迟疑地问道。

"God! Damnit! Yes Third-" her holo squawked then smacked him in the head, "I do like you too, okay!? I can't believe it's taken following you into a hallucinated reality for you to understand that!"
"天啊！该死！是的，Third——"她的全息影像尖叫着，然后给了他一记头槌，"我也喜欢你，好吗！？真不敢相信，要追随你进入一个幻觉现实，你才能明白这一点！"

In her plugsuit within the void, she said, "I'll make it easy for you." She reached down and gradually picked up the futon mattress off the ground in front of an astonished Shinji, and carried it into Misato's room. There she dropped it ceremoniously, then closed the door behind her with a foot.
在虚空中的插入栓内，她说道："我会让你轻松点。"她伸手缓缓捡起地上的褥垫，在震惊的碇真嗣面前，将其搬进了美里房间。她在那里庄重地放下褥垫，随后用脚关上了门。

She took off the bra she had been wearing, then dropped to the futon on all fours, facing the door. Her stolen yellow shirt hung loose as it did before. Then she slid open the door.
她脱下一直穿着的胸罩，随后四肢着地趴在蒲团上，面朝门口。那件偷来的黄色衬衫依旧松垮地挂着。接着，她拉开了门。

She said to him, "If you want my help getting out of the Eva, do something you should have done the right way a long time ago. No hesitation, no more chances. I'll have all of you, or nothing at all. Either stay there, or open this door and come to me."
她对他说：“如果你想让我帮你离开 Eva，那就做一件你早就该做对的事。不要犹豫，没有更多机会了。我要么得到你的全部，要么一无所有。要么留在那里，要么打开这扇门，来到我身边。”

She slammed Misato's door shut and waited. Her head held up for a moment, then bowed as she took a breath and thought about what could happen.
她砰地一声关上了美里家的门，然后等待着。她昂首片刻，随后低下头，深吸一口气，思考着可能发生的事情。

She said it. 她说了。

Coming here she hadn't realized the extent of her feelings for Shinji, but she couldn't deny her zeal in pushing for him to reveal his, and the emotion she felt when he confessed in the apartment. Now she had come all this way, and in spite of what she said earlier, Asuka couldn't deny how she felt. She DID want the sincerity of his feelings. It made her anxious to know the answer.
来到这里之前，她并未意识到自己对真嗣的感情有多深，但她无法否认自己极力促使他表露心迹的热情，以及他在公寓中坦白时她所感受到的情感。如今她已走到了这一步，尽管之前她曾那样说，明日香无法否认自己的真实感受。她确实渴望得到他真挚的情感。得知答案让她感到焦虑不安。

She took another breath, about to give up, when the door cracked open and light bled into the room. Hesitantly, Shinji stepped into the room, one foot after the other, and stood just inside the doorway. She looked up at him. He looked down at her.
她深吸一口气，正准备放弃，这时门裂开一条缝，光线渗入房间。踌躇着，真嗣一步接一步地走进房间，站在门口内侧。她抬头看向他。他低头看向她。

She shifted on the bed and lay on her back, scooting on to the cot that she had laid down. "Well, come in." She said softly.
她在床上挪动了一下，仰面躺下，移到她之前铺好的小床上。“嗯，进来吧。”她轻声说道。

Shinji swallowed and closed the door behind him. In the dark he came down onto the cot, where Asuka pulled him on top of her. He was shivering slightly. "Nerves?" She asked him.
真嗣咽了口唾沫，关上身后的门。在黑暗中，他来到小床边，那里明日香拉他趴在她身上。他微微颤抖着。“紧张吗？”她问他。

"S-s-sorry." He uttered.
"对-对-对不起。" 他结巴着说。

"Just don't talk." She replied gently, wrapping both arms and legs around him to pin him to her.
"就别说话了。" 她轻声回应，双臂双腿紧紧缠绕住他，将他牢牢固定在自己身上。

His hand in hers, she took steps in the darkness in the direction she thought she needed to go. She glanced back and saw Shinji there, also in his plugsuit, eyes bouncing upward from her back to her own eyes. He smiled a little. She smiled back, a rarity for a moment like this, but one that gave him some reassurance.
他的手握在她的手中，她在黑暗中朝着自认为需要前进的方向迈步。她回头望去，看见了身着插入栓服的真嗣，他的目光从她的背上跳跃到她的眼睛。他微微一笑。她也回以微笑，在这般时刻实属罕见，却给了他些许安慰。

FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER FEHLER
错误错误错误错误错误错误错误错误

Both of them were in the red plugsuits, inside unit 02 for the first time again.
两人都穿着红色插入栓服，再次第一次进入二号机内部。

Shinji, confused, asked, "W-What's happening?"
真嗣困惑地问道：“这……这是怎么了？”

Asuka blinked twice, but leaned into where she was and what was happening. She re-gripped the handles. "Hell if I know. My guess is your Eva isn't going to let you go without a fight. Didn't you say something about your mother wanting you to join her?"
明日香眨了两下眼，但还是投入到当前的处境和正在发生的事情中。她重新握紧了把手。“我怎么知道。我猜你的 Eva 不会轻易放你走。你不是说过你妈妈想让你加入她吗？”

Shinji blinked, confused, "Did…did I say that? I can't remember…"
真嗣眨了眨眼，感到困惑，“我…我说过那话吗？我不记得了…”

"Nevermind!" Asuka replied, "If this is what we're given, let's do what we did before. Evangelion, launch!"
“算了！”明日香回答道，“既然这是我们面对的，那就按之前的方法来。初号机，启动！”

As before in the real world, the massive red Evangelion punched through the flimsy yellow tarp which protected it on the deck of the Othello. Through the water, the streak of the attacking angel snaked towards the transport.
如同现实世界中一样，巨大的红色福音战士一拳穿透了奥赛罗号甲板上保护它的脆弱黄色帆布。透过水面，攻击天使的轨迹蜿蜒向运输船袭来。

Evangelion 02 jumped out of the boat just before it was destroyed. Asuka hopscotched through the fleet, landing again on the deck of the Over the Rainbow and causing jets and planes to fall off the deck.
福音战士 02 在船只被摧毁前一跃而出。明日香在舰队间跳跃，再次落在彩虹号甲板上，导致甲板上的喷气机和飞机纷纷坠落。

Asuka was hitching the power cable to the Evangelion as the radio announced from Misato, "Target closing in fast!"
明日香正将电源线连接到福音战士上，此时无线电中传来美里急促的声音：“目标正快速接近！”

Shinji, coming up beside her in the cockpit seat, asked, "Are you really sure that's my mother out there? Why… would would she…?"
真嗣在驾驶座旁坐下，问道：“你真的确定那外面是我妈妈吗？为什么……她会……？”

"No time!" Asuka replied and deployed the Progressive knife. The red blade hummed in the hands of the Evangelion as Asuka waited for the Angel- presumably the thing they had to defeat- to appear.
"没时间了！"明日香回答道，随即展开了进步的刀刃。红色刀锋在福音战士手中嗡嗡作响，明日香等待着天使——大概是他们必须击败的东西——出现。

Only it wasn't the fish Angel to emerge from the water. Instead, to the astonishment and horror of both of them, an oversized demonic form of Evangelion 01 breached the water. "What!?" Both kids asked as a massive, sinewy red arm seized unit 02.
然而，从水中浮现的并非天使鱼。相反，令两人震惊和恐惧的是，一个巨大的恶魔化零号机从水中冲出。“什么！？”两个孩子惊呼，只见一只粗壮的红色手臂猛地抓住了二号机。

The monstrous form brought the insignificant red Evangelion up to its jaws, then the jaws quickly snapped over it, biting down on the Evangelion's chest and head. The kids screamed as the demonic Eva bit down hard, shaking both of them in the cockpit.
这怪物般的形态将渺小的红色机体举至嘴边，随即迅速合拢巨口，狠狠咬住了机体的胸部和头部。孩子们在驾驶舱内尖叫起来，随着恶魔化机体的猛烈咬合，他们也被剧烈摇晃。

Asuka uttered over Shinji's torso, "This is great. Now what? If this is a metaphor, how do we fight it?"
明日香俯视着真嗣的身躯，说道：“这太棒了。现在怎么办？如果这是个隐喻，我们该怎么与之抗争？”

Shinji was serious in the cockpit. "She has to let me go."
真嗣在驾驶舱里神情严肃。“她必须放我走。”

"Well, duh." Asuka replied, "How do we get her to do that?"
“废话。”明日香回答道，“我们怎么让她这么做？”

Shinji hesitated, then said, "I need to do it."
真嗣犹豫了一下，然后说：“我需要亲自去做。”

"You do? Then what did I come all this way for?"
你真的知道？那我大老远跑来是为了什么？

Shinji, beneath her but sharing the control hand-holds, uttered, "I couldn't do this without you here. It's… It's easier." Shinji couldn't see Asuka blushing, but he did notice her lack of a retort. Shifting his gloved hands under hers on the handles, he said, "Mother, let me go!"
真嗣在她的下方，共握着控制把手，说道：“没有你在这里，我做不到。这……这更轻松了。”真嗣看不到明日香脸红，但他确实注意到了她没有反驳。他移动戴着手套的双手，放在她手下的把手上，说：“母亲，让我去吧！”

Rei stood before them in her plugsuit. "You cannot change what is now preordained. Evangelion 01 will be used for the ritual. Your place is here in this Evangelion, ready to intercept SEELE when they attempt to launch instrumentality."
绫波站在他们面前，身着插入栓服。“你们无法改变既定的命运。初号机将被用于仪式。你的位置就在这台福音战士中，随时准备在 SEELE 试图启动人类补完计划时进行拦截。”

Shinji was standing in front, Asuka just behind him. His balled fists were at his sides. "But I want to see everyone again! I want to exist, be in the world! Try again!"
真嗣站在前面，明日香紧随其后。他紧握的拳头放在身体两侧。“但我还想再见大家一面！我想存在，想活在这个世界上！再试一次！”

Rei said, "Your father will have you in chains for what you have done." Her head lowered, "You will no longer be free. You will be a tool for his use, when the time is right." A naked Rei now smiled, "You are safer here. With me. Together we can prepare to thwart SEELE and your father. Together we can save the world."
绫波说：“你所做的一切，你父亲会让你戴上镣铐。”她低下头，“你将不再自由。你将成为他适时使用的工具。”此刻赤裸的绫波微笑着，“你在这里更安全。和我一起。我们可以一起准备阻止 SEELE 和你父亲。我们可以一起拯救世界。”

Shinji didn't answer immediately, but his fists shook some. Asuka looked at him as he said, "My… My father? What does my father have planned?"
真嗣没有立即回答，但他的拳头有些颤抖。明日香看着他，他问道：“我……我的父亲？我父亲有什么计划？”

"He is taking a big risk with instrumentality for a selfish outcome." Rei replied, "He is preparing to upset my plans."
“他为了一个自私的结果，在人类补完计划上冒了很大的风险。”绫波回答，“他正准备破坏我的计划。”

Asuka stepped forward then. "Wait, your plans? Who are you?"
明日香此时上前一步：“等等，你的计划？你是谁？”

In the blink of an eye, Ayanami was replaced with a tall woman- clearly now, a much older version of Rei. She wore a white labcoat and purple turtleneck. Both teenagers were agape at the appearance of the woman. Shinji uttered, "M-Mother…"
眨眼间，绫波被一位高挑的女性所取代——显然，这是绫波的更成熟版本。她身着白色实验服和紫色高领衫。两位少年对这位女性的出现目瞪口呆。真嗣结结巴巴地说：“妈……妈妈……”

"Shinji." The woman said, "If you leave, I will no longer be able to protect you. The S2 gives me tremendous power, but it is too easily used for the wrong reasons. Instrumentality now has the trigger. All that remains are the last of the Angels to die, and the conditions will be ready for Instrumentality." Her eyes narrowed, "If it is is not launched perfectly, the human race will die. If I cannot save all of them, the least I can do is save you."
“真嗣。”这位女性说道，“如果你离开，我将无法再保护你。S2 赋予我巨大的力量，但它太容易被用于错误的目的。现在，人类补完计划已经有了触发器。剩下的就是最后几个使徒的消亡，条件就将为人类补完计划准备就绪。”她的眼神变得锐利，“如果不能完美地启动，人类将会灭亡。如果我不能拯救所有人，至少我可以救你。”

Shinji shook his head a little. "W-What about Asuka? And Misato and… everyone else?"
真嗣轻轻摇了摇头。“那明日香呢？还有美里和……其他人呢？”

"Asuka can remain here." Yui said without looking at the redhead, "But everyone else I cannot save. You cannot save them, either. Your only choice is to remain here with me, where it's safe. Where I can protect you."
"明日香可以留在这里。" 唯没有看向红发少女，"但其他人我无法拯救。你也无法拯救他们。你唯一的选择是留在这里，和我一起，这里是安全的。在这里我能保护你。"

Shinji didn't answer for a moment, only quietly uttered, "Is… is this true…?"
真嗣一时没有回答，只是轻声问道：“这……这是真的吗……？”

Asuka looked between the boy and his mother. She didn't understand what was going on, but that didn't matter. "No." She said, coming around Shinji, "He's coming with me."
明日香在男孩和他母亲之间来回打量。她不明白发生了什么，但这并不重要。“不。”她说着绕过真嗣，“他要跟我走。”

Yui's eyes went from Shinji to the girl. The gaze was cold. "And what makes you think you have any power of decision here?"
绫波的目光从真嗣转向那女孩，眼神冷冽。“你凭什么认为自己有决定权？”

Asuka blinked, swallowed, and took two breaths before she said, "Because I want him. I want him to come back with me."
明日香眨了眨眼，咽了口唾沫，深吸了两口气后说道：“因为我想要他。我想让他跟我一起回来。”

Yui shook her head slowly. "You're making just as selfish of a decision as the commander is. You would steal the life of one boy and condemn millions? This is the only way to ensure instrumentality is foiled." She winced, "Or were you not listening just now?"
绫摇了摇头，缓缓说道：“你做出的决定和指挥官一样自私。你要夺走一个男孩的生命，却让数百万人受苦？这是唯一确保人类补完计划失败的方法。”她皱了皱眉，“还是说你刚才没在听？”

"Then we'll find some way to stop it." Asuka said, "Or change it. Or do something. But he can't do any good stuck in the eva unit. He comes with me, and we have a chance to change things."
“那我们就想办法阻止它。”明日香说，“或者改变它，或者采取其他行动。但他被困在 EVA 机体里什么也做不了。他得跟我走，我们才有机会改变现状。”

Yui winced. "You have even less power than Shinji does." her face raised a degree, "You barely amount to any significance for what is to come. You were always the spare pilot with the spare Evangelion. The first to fall, if needed."
绫波微微皱眉。“你甚至比真嗣还要无力。”她的表情略显严肃，“对于即将到来的事，你几乎无足轻重。你一直是那个备用的驾驶员，驾驶着备用的福音战士。一旦需要，你将是第一个倒下的。”

"Well, fuck you too." Asuka replied, "Because this 'spare' is leaving with Shinji. And that's final."
“好啊，你也滚蛋吧。”明日香回敬道，“因为这位‘备胎’要和真嗣一起走了。就这样定了。”

Shinji sputtered from behind her, "U-Um… can't we at least talk about this?"
真嗣在她身后结巴着说：“呃……我们至少能谈谈这个吗？”

"No. This isn't something for debate." Asuka replied and whirled to Shinji. Her eyes locked on his. "When I told you I'll have all of you, it meant no compromises with anyone else." She crossed her arms, "If you WANT to stay, that's different. But I thought you already decided to come with me when you crossed that door."
"不，这不是可以讨论的事情。" 明日香回答道，转身面向真嗣。她的目光紧紧锁定在他身上。"当我告诉你我要拥有你全部的时候，意味着不会与任何人妥协。" 她交叉双臂，"如果你想留下，那是另一回事。但我认为当你跨过那扇门时，你已经决定跟我走了。"

Shinji's face crunched with conflicted feelings. After a couple of seconds, he realized what Asuka was saying, and resolve dawned on his face. He looked up at her. "I… I'm leaving."
真嗣的脸上充满了矛盾的情绪。几秒钟后，他明白了明日香的意思，决心在他的脸上显现。他抬头看向她。"我…我要离开。"

Asuka smiled. Yui frowned, then took in a breath and sighed, "This is the last time I'll be able to see you, Shinji. You'll be on your own."
明日香微笑着。绫波皱了皱眉，然后深吸一口气，叹息道：“这是最后一次能见到你了，真嗣。你得自己一个人了。”

Shinji took a couple of steps to stand beside Asuka. "I… I think that's okay mother. I think… I think… I think I want to try. I think I'm ready to try."
真嗣向前走了几步，站在明日香旁边。“我…我觉得这没问题，妈妈。我…我想…我想我愿意尝试。我想我已经准备好尝试了。”

Yui stared at her son for a moment more. Then she smiled a little. "We'll see." She looked at Asuka then, and said, "Be kind to him."
唯又凝视了儿子一会儿，然后微微一笑。“我们拭目以待。”她看向明日香，说道：“对他温柔点。”

The neck door on Evangelion 01 opened and the Entry Plug ejected. It rolled out of the purple body, came to a stop, and the top door popped open. LCL gushed out of it for the second time, spilling out all over the deck.
初号机的颈部舱门打开，插入栓被弹射出来。它从紫色的机体中滚出，停了下来，顶部的舱门随即弹开。LCL 第二次涌出，洒满了整个甲板。

Sirens and alarms were ringing and the deck hands swarmed towards the plug. Misato and Ritsuko were in that number, coming up next to the white entry plug and slowing to a stop.
警报声和汽笛声此起彼伏，甲板上的船员们纷纷涌向插头。碇真嗣和丽也在其中，他们靠近白色的插入栓，随即放慢脚步停了下来。

Asuka braced a foot against rim of the door and heaved, half-carrying a plugsuit-clad Shinji out of the entry plug. They both landed on the deck, before Asuka bowed down to land on a knee. The technicians were on them quickly.
明日香一脚抵住舱门边缘，用力一拉，半扶半拖着身穿插入栓服的真嗣从插入栓中出来。两人一同跌落在甲板上，随后明日香弯腰单膝跪地。技术人员迅速围了上来。

Misato let out a long held breath, and uttered, "I can't believe it, she did it. She got him."
美里长舒了一口气，喃喃道：“真不敢相信，她做到了。她把他追到手了。”

**IV. Deliverance IV. 救赎**

The clock ticked over to midnight. Shinji rolled his head in the examination bed. "H-Happy birthday, Asuka."  
时钟指向了午夜。真嗣在检查床上转过头。“生、生日快乐，明日香。”

"Yeah, yeah." The redhead said in the chair beside his bed. "We'll celebrate it after you're discharged. Just lie there, get better, and make it up to me when you can."  
"嗯嗯。" 红发少年坐在他床边的椅子上说道，"等你出院了我们再庆祝。你就躺着，好好恢复，到时候再补偿我。

It was just the two of them in that quiet hospital room deep in the Terminal Dogma. It was barely two hours since the two of them returned from the plug… days after Asuka had gone in. Asuka managed to pass a cursory examination, but for Shinji, a more through examination was needed for the boy who had been in the Eva for over a month.  
"在这深处的 Terminal Dogma 医院病房里，只有他们两人。距离他们从插入栓返回才不过两小时……那是 Asuka 进去几天后的事。Asuka 勉强通过了初步检查，但对于在 Eva 中待了一个多月的 Shinji，则需要更彻底的检查。

Asuka's legs were crossed and one of her feet bounced idly as she was looking at a book she brought. She had been discharged a while ago, but was waiting for Misato to visit Shinji in order to get a ride back to the apartment. She was using the time and the silence to collect her thoughts… a lot had happened in the past few days she still needed to process. For now, she masked her behavior by hiding behind a small novel.  
"Asuka 双腿交叉，一只脚无意识地轻弹着，她正看着自己带来的书。她已经出院一段时间了，但正在等 Misato 来探望 Shinji，以便搭车回公寓。她利用这段安静的时间整理思绪……过去几天发生了太多事，她还需要时间去消化。此刻，她通过一本小说的掩护来掩饰自己的行为。

"H-Hey." Shinji said, getting her attention. When she turned to face him again, he smiled a little. "You didn't have to come after me. Thank you."  
"嗨，嘿。" 真嗣说道，引起了她的注意。当她再次转过身面对他时，他微微一笑。"你不必追出来的。谢谢你。"

"Hmf. You're welcome." Asuka replied, turning back to the book. "When you fucking _astral project_ into the apartment, it's kind of hard to resist a kind of request like that."  
"哼。不客气。" 明日香回答道，转回书本。"当你他妈的灵魂出窍到公寓里时，那种请求真的很难拒绝。"

"I… I really did that?"  
"我…我真的那么做了吗？"

Asuka turned to him. "You mean you don't remember!?"  
明日香转向他。“你是说你不记得了！？”

Shinji blinked. "I… I think so? It's… it's hard. It's like trying to remember a dream you had after just waking up. I don't… I don't remember much before we…uh… re-did the training night."  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“我…我想是的？这…这很难。就像刚醒来时试图回忆一个梦。我…我不记得在我们…呃…重新进行训练之夜之前的事情了。”

Silence hung in the air between them two of them, and Asuka looked back at her book. She flipped a page without reading anything to think, then asked, "Do you remember what you said to me… when you came to the apartment?"  
两人之间弥漫着沉默，明日香又看向她的书。她翻了一页，没有阅读，而是在思考，然后问道：“你还记得你来公寓时对我说了什么吗…？”

Shinji didn't answer immediately. She opened her mouth to speak before he said quietly, "I do."  
真嗣没有立即回答。她张口欲言，而他轻声说道：“我愿意。”

She closed her mouth. Then she asked, "Do you still mean it?"  
她闭上了嘴。然后问道：“你现在还是这么想吗？”

"...yes." He replied. He looked at her for a long moment, then looked at his hands on the bedsheet as he tried to assess his feelings. Then he said, "I would have stepped through the door, before, if I knew it was okay."  
“……是的。”他回答道。他凝视了她好一会儿，随后目光落在床单上自己的手上，试图理清自己的情感。接着他说：“如果早知道可以，我之前就会跨过那扇门。”

Asuka flipped another unread page. "What are you talking about? You _did_ step through that door."  
明日香又翻过一页未读的纸张。“你在说什么呢？你确实穿过了那扇门。”

Shinji's eyes bugged a little bit and he looked at her. "Wait… does that… does that mean you-"  
真嗣的眼睛微微瞪大，他看向她。“等等…那是不是意味着你…”

"If you back out on me Shinji, I'll take it personally." Asuka replied and flipped another page. "At least take me out on a date first. As far as I'm concerned, presently, you're mine."  
“如果你现在退缩，真嗣，我会很生气的。”明日香回答着，又翻了一页。“至少先带我出去约会吧。就目前而言，你属于我。”

Shinji blinked and looked back down at the bedsheets, and then at his hands. He still couldn't shake this feeling that something had changed… something was new. The source was beside him, radiating like the heat of a fire in a snowstorm. There was a way out of the cave now, a way forward. Someone to trust.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，低头看向床单，然后又看向自己的双手。他仍然无法摆脱这种感觉，似乎有什么东西改变了……有些新事物出现了。源头就在他身旁，如同雪暴中的火焰般散发着热量。现在有了走出洞穴的路，有了前进的方向。有了可以信赖的人。

He turned his head slowly to look at her again with new eyes. Slowly, she turned to look back at him and smile. Blushing a little, he said, "Happy birthday, Asuka."  
他缓缓转过头，用新的眼光再次看向她。慢慢地，她也转过来看着他，并露出了微笑。他略带羞涩地说：“生日快乐，明日香。”

_Fin._

_Happy belated birthday, Asuka.  
迟到的生日快乐，明日香。_

---

_A/n: originally this started out months ago as Asuka's version of Splint. Once I realized I could use this for Asuka's actual birthday I kicked it into high gear and powered through Asuka having her first sighting of Shinji to being stuck in the dream encounter. I had no plan for that, so it took a few days to make something passable. I hope it hangs well as a decent story.  
作者的话：最初几个月前，这故事是以明日香版本的'Splint'开始的。当我意识到可以用它来庆祝明日香的实际生日时，我便加快速度，一口气从明日香第一次见到真嗣写到她被困在梦境中。我对此毫无计划，所以花了几天时间才弄出个过得去的版本。希望这个故事能算得上是不错的。_

_I feel the premise could still be done better if it was given more time, but this was the result. Perhaps someday I'll do what Lazarus Sense was to Panacea and re-do this in order to make it better and lean into the direction suggested by the first few chapters- long gaps, doubts of Asuka's sanity. But this will do for now. Besides, it's better to finish a story than leave it forever in the drafts with lost potential.  
我觉得如果给这个前提更多时间，它本可以做得更好，但这就是目前的结果。或许将来我会像《拉撒路感应》之于《万能药》那样，重写这个故事，让它更贴近前几章所暗示的方向——长时间的间隔，对明日香理智的怀疑。但目前这样也行。毕竟，完成一个故事总比让它永远留在草稿中，失去其潜力要好_
