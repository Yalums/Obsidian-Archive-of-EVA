We were all standing in front of a statue of a young girl. We had already heard that her name was Asuka.  
我们都站在一座年轻女孩的雕像前，早已知晓少女的名字叫做明日香。

The strangers around us all had the similar sad expression in their eyes, almost like they would hug the person next to them and started to cry the very next moment. I didn't understand what makes them feel so emotionally involved. This girl, her wings withered to the point that a cloud of feathers was clustered tightly around the soles of her feet. Tight suit set off her delicate figure, which undoubtedly looked too thin under the gaze of most people. Her right arm was somehow wrapped in bandages, and those bandages were not wrapped tight, with the very tip of it hanging down to the ground from her arm. Her body leaned forward slightly, as if she was about to fall. Only her right eye seemed intact, the other covered by a gauze pad. She looked like she just returned from the battlefield, her eyes sharp and terrifying, like gazing at an enemy. She stood still, as if fate had ordered her to do so. Her "skin" was as pale as marble.  
周围的陌生人，眼里尽是相似的悲伤神情，仿佛下一刻就会与身旁的人相抱哭泣，我不理解他们因何如此。这个女孩，她的翅膀已经枯萎到羽毛紧紧聚集在脚底的程度，紧身衣衬托出她那纤细的身姿，但在人们的目光下无疑太过单薄。她的右臂不知为何裹着绷带，那些绷带并不紧实，末端垂落至地面，身体微向前倾，仿佛将要倾倒。她似乎只有右眼完好无损，另一只是被纱布覆盖，看上去是刚从战场上归来，眼神锐利而可怕，犹如正凝视着敌人。她静静地站立，仿佛命运如此要求，“皮肤”苍白如大理石。

We call such eternally static characters, different from our own constructs, sculptures.  
我们称这种永恒静止的角色，构造与我们截然不同的实体，为雕塑。

This was EVA unit-02's pilot back then, Asuka Soryu Langley. Unfortunately, she still hasn't come out of the sea of LCL. It's been fifty years since the Third Impact, and the people she knows were either old or have died of old age, and I don't think she wanted to come out. Those who have returned in recent years were often not very mentally stable. If they have no relatives, then they have to live with a welfare institution who could take them in, they may be treated less than farm animals.  
她是那时驾驶着 EVA 二号机的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。遗憾的是，她至今仍未从 LCL 之海中归来。距离第三次冲击已过去五十年，她所认识的人或已老去或已离世，我想她也不会再回这里了。近年来回归的人往往精神状态不佳，若无亲人，便只得依靠福利机构来，收容后的待遇或许还比不上被饲养的动物。

If I were to judge, this sculpture is indeed a lifelike piece of work, but to call it "a master piece" seemed a bit over-rated.  
若要我做评价，这尊雕塑的确是栩栩如生，称其为是“杰作”则是有些过誉。

"Tom?" That's when a man called my name.  
“汤姆？”有一个人叫住了我的名字。

"Yukimura!"
"幸村！"

My friend Shi Yukimura, who is also an extremely talented sculptor. This exhibition was held in honor of his extremely talented mentor, and a great artist, Shinji Ikari.  
这是我的朋友石幸村，他也是一位极其才华的雕塑家。这次展览是为了纪念他尤为出色的导师，以及伟大的艺术家，碇真嗣。

"I'm glad you're here." Yukimura said.  
"我很高兴你来了。"幸村说。

"You invited me so heartily, I can't refuse." Actually, I also wanted to take the opportunity to learn more about this Mr. Ikari. He is one of the rarest breeds of artists in today's fractured world who has sunk his heart into sincere creation. Sadly, however, he passed away at this time last year, and it was a very strange suicide.  
"你如此热情地邀请我，我怎能拒绝呢。" 实际上，我也想借此机会更多地了解这位碇先生。他是当今这个残缺落败世界里极为罕见的、全身心投入真诚搞创作的艺术家之一。然而遗憾的是，他于去年的这个时候离世，以一场极为离奇的自杀谢幕。

"Since this is a rare opportunity, what can you tell me about this statue?" I pointing to the girl's face.  
"既然这是个难得的机会，你能告诉我关于这座雕像的事情吗？" 我指向白皙塑像女孩的脸庞。

"This is Asuka, Ikari -san's lover."  
"她是明日香，碇先生曾经的恋人。"

"Yes, I know that, but I don't know why he created such statue for her."  
"是的，我知道这一点，但我不明白他为什么要为她立起这尊雕像。"

"Well, because I not sure whether to exhibit this work or not." Yukimura stroked his shaved beard and said, "After all, he left so suddenly that he didn't even leave a suicide note."  
"事实上，就连我也无法确定是否真要展出这件作品。" 幸村抚摸着他剃光的胡须说道，"毕竟，他离开得如此突然，甚至没有留下遗书。"

"I want to know why her face is so serious and cruel?"  
"我想知道她的表情为何显得如此肃穆而凶狠？"

"That's because ..." Yukimura was just about to speak when he noticed everyone around him was looking at us. So, he coughed awkwardly and pulled me out of the crowd. "Let's talk somewhere else."  
"那是因为……" 幸村正要开口，却发现周围的人都望向我们。于是，他尴尬地咳了一声，把我从人群中拉了出来，"让我们换个地方说话吧。"

We arrived at a lounge. He sat down on a chair and sniffled sadly. I knew he was feeling sad about his teacher's sudden departure again, so I patted him on the shoulder.  
我们来到一个休息室。他坐到椅子上，伤心地吸了吸鼻子。我知道他又在为老师的突然离开感到难过，于是我拍了拍他的肩膀。

"He was such a kind gentleman." He said, "He followed his girl and never came back, just like that."  
"他真是个善良的绅士。" 他说，"他追随他的女孩，就此别离再不归来。"

"What do you mean? Did he die for Asuka?"  
"你这是什么意思？他这是为了明日香而死的吗？"

"Precisely, and as far as I can see, he lived just for her. All his honed skills, all his hard work of blood and sweat, all so that he could carve her gesture accurately. He was so eager to see her again that he even went so far as to jumped into the "Red Sea" and left us, the people who looked upon his art, behind forever."  
"正是如此，依我所见，他也是为她而活。他为此磨练全部的技艺。那些血汗的努力，不过是能够精确地描绘出她的姿态的需要。他如此渴望再次见到她，甚至不惜跳入“红海”，永远离开了我们这些欣赏他艺术的人。"

"I would like to know exactly what kind of connection the pilot of EVA unit-2 has with your master."  
"我想知道，二号机驾驶员与你师父之间究竟有什么样的联系。"

"It's hard for me to describe, but I can tell you how it happened."  
"那很难用言语形容。不过，我可以告诉你事情的经过。"

---

"Here's the thing. You know that my teacher was also an EVA pilot, affiliated with NERV in Japan, but he himself forgot most things that happened before the Third Impact. That's right, the artwork you see here, created from his hands are the remnants of before Third Impact memories that were vaguely remained in his mind, like a ship that disintegrated in the middle of the ocean then washed ashore with only scattered parts, the vast majority of which could not be recovered."  
"事情是这样的。你知道我的老师也是一名 EVA 驾驶员，隶属于日本的 NERV，但他自己忘记了第三次冲击前的大部分事情。没错，你在这里看到的画作，出自他手的这些作品，是他脑海中模糊残留的第三次冲击前的记忆碎片，就像一艘在大洋中解体的船只，只有冲刷上岸的散落部件，绝大多数的其他部分已是无法找回。"

"We call the art style created by Mr. Ikari 'disaster abstractionism', and some people are not so fond of it, thinking that it is not art at all. Because each of us 'survivors' thinks we ourselves saw the most wonderful thing in the sea of LCL, even though these memories were caught in the vortex of a high-speed stream of consciousness. So, if you just attempt to materialize this 'abstract vortex', it may be too mixed up to resemble what you want to embody."  
"我们称碇先生创造的艺术风格为‘灾难抽象派’，有些人并不喜欢，认为那根本不是艺术。因为我们这些‘幸存者’，每个人都认为自己看到了 LCL 之海中最美妙的东西，尽管那些记忆早被卷入高速流动的意识漩涡。所以，如果你试图将这个‘抽象漩涡’具体化，那一切都太过混杂，以至于无法呈现出你想要表达的东西。"

"But not Mr. Ikari, who can be said to be the originator of 'disaster abstractionism', and also its greatest betrayer. See those two 'Red Sea' paintings? He painted two of them, one featuring composition of cut fragments arranged in parallel. He drew those fragments based on what he saw during his 'instrumentality'. The other one was painted layers over layers by stacking them vertically over each other. You have to work very hard to distinguish them in order to see the meaning of each layer and then layers as whole. But once you do, you will be shocked and convinced by its actual meaning."  
"但碇先生不同，他可谓是“灾难抽象派”的开创者，同时也是其最大的背叛者。看那两幅《红海》画作？他创作了两幅，一幅以切割碎片并列排列的构图呈现，这些碎片是基于他在“人类补完计划”中所见绘制而成。另一幅则是层层叠加，垂直堆砌而成。你必须费尽心思去分离开每层，进而理解各部分与整体的含义。然而一旦你领悟，便会为其中的深意震撼，折服于此。

"Loneliness is an ever-present theme in all of his work. Although he had a great career. As a hero who saved mankind from extinction, he had many, many advocates, but he doesn't pay any attention to that. You know, his father was the chief culprit of 'Human Instrumentality Project', and his mother died in one of project's early experiments. Although our beloved new UN President Misato Katsuragi cared for him during his lifetime, granted his wish to be sent to a remote town to pursue his artistic career, AND to ensure that he would not be drawn into political disputes. However, President Katsuragi's gesture cannot reach his heart, since in Mr. Ikari's view, those gestures can only be considered an outward gift. Most importantly, he can't remember what kind of person he was, or what he did before his 'instrumentality', leading him to a lifetime of searching for his past. The only clues he had, are the pieces of the puzzle the entity called 'Lilith' left in his mind during his 'instrumentality', so his method is to materialize them in an artistic way. Incidentally, Mr. Ikari is also a competent cellist, and he often plays Bach at his leisure. It's one of the few things he can remember."  
"孤独是他所有作品中永恒的主题。尽管他事业有成，作为拯救人类免于灭绝的英雄，他拥有众多拥护者，但他对此毫不在意。你知道，他的父亲是“人类补完计划”的主谋，而母亲则在计划早期的实验中丧生。尽管我们敬爱的新联合国总理赤木律子在他生前给予了他关怀，满足了他被送往偏远小镇追求艺术生涯的愿望，并确保他不会卷入政治纷争。然而，律子总理的这些举动无法触及他的内心，因为在碇先生看来，这些只是能被视作外部的恩赐。最重要的是，他不记得自己曾是怎样的人，或是“补完”之前做过什么，这让他一生都在追寻过去。他仅有的线索，是那个被称为“莉莉丝”的实体在他“补完”过程中留在他脑海中的拼图碎片，那么他的方法就是将它们以艺术的形式具象化。顺带一提，碇先生还是一位称职的大提琴手，闲暇时常演奏巴赫的作品，这是他少数还能记得的事情之一。"

"Ikari-san has very few photos of himself, and the only one left is a photo with his classmates and friends. There are indeed quite a few combat photo-archives of the Evangelions in action, but as you can see, he never bothered to create works about EVAs. He abhorred those things, which is why he would stay away from all the fame that came with the title of 'pilot of EVA unit-1'. He would get sick with dry heaves the next day, from dreams of the EVA unit-1 he was piloting standing in a pool of blood. He would lash out at the EVA fans and admirers. 'I have no memory, but I know those things are the main reason that ruined my life.' Those were his exact words. However, when it comes to the pilot of EVA unit-2, he gladly receives all information about her, including their experiences piloting EVAs together, and he will even tell me stories about it when I ask."  
"碇先生几乎没有自己的照片，仅存的一张是与同学和朋友的合影。确实有不少关于使徒之战的行动照片档案，但正如你所见，他从不制作有关 EVA 的作品。他厌恶那些东西，这也是为何他会远离“初号机驾驶员”这一称号以及其带来的所有名誉。他在第二天会因梦见自己驾驶的初号机站在血泊中而干呕不止，他会向 EVA 的粉丝和仰慕者怒责，“我不再记得那些，但我知道正是那些东西毁掉了我的生活。”这是他的原话。然而，当谈论二号机驾驶员的时候，他欣然接受一切有关她的信息，包括他们共同驾驶 EVA 的经历，甚至在我询问时还会向我讲述那些故事。

"He said, 'When they told me that Asuka was my roommate back in the day, and we fought alongside each other. I thought, ah, that's right! Though I don't remember that, I could feel what they were saying was something that really happened, because Asuka did live in my life once. She called me a 'baka' ... yes, and that's what she called me in my dreams.'"  
"他说：‘当他们告诉我，当年明日香是我的室友，我们一起并肩作战。我想，啊，是这样！虽然我不记得了，但我能感觉到他们说的是真实发生过的事，因为明日香确实曾在我生命中存在过。她叫我‘笨蛋’……是的，在我的梦里，她就是这么叫我的。’”

"Mr. Ikari had been waiting for her, and he often took the tram to the LCL seaside and wandered outside the 'no-entry area'. There were people who come ashore there every day, often confused when they were taken to identify their relatives. People laughed at him for being forty-eight years old, yet only wanted to marry a young girl. When he was about fifty, he got chronic hepatitis, and after he recovered from the disease, he decided that he would carve a sculpture of Asuka. In case she came back after he passed away. He wanted the sculpture to at least convey his inner thoughts for her. When he was fully engaged in its creation process, everything in the world turned into hollow, and only he and this creation were real. When he was tired, he slept in the studio. When he woke up, he continues from where he left off. From start to finish, it took him only six months to finish this sculpture."  
"碇先生一直在等她，他经常乘坐电车来到 LCL 之海，徘徊在‘禁止进入区域’外。那里每天都有人上岸，常常在被带去辨认亲属时感到困惑。人们嘲笑他四十八岁了，却只想娶一个年轻女孩。五十岁左右时，他患上了慢性肝炎，病愈后，他决定要为明日香雕刻一尊塑像，以防自己去世后她回来。他希望这尊塑像至少能传达他对她的内心情感。当他全身心投入创作过程时，世界上的一切都变得空洞，只有他和这件作品是真实的。累了，他就在工作室里睡；醒来，又继续未完的工作。从头到尾，他只用了六个月就完成了这尊雕塑。"

"Yet, on the day the sculpture was completed, he went insane."  
"然而，就在雕塑完成的那天，他陷入了精神失常。"

I recalled the news report claiming that Shinji Ikari was the only one who jumped into the sea of LCL and succeeded in committing suicide. This statue was his last work. As we all know, LCL can't drown a person, but they never recovered his body. So, they can only speculate that he "melted" in the LCL by his strong longingness for his lover. Ironically, on the very day the news report came out, several of his more fanatic fans followed suit and jumped into the sea of LCL in a vain attempt join him. None of them died, and they were later rescued. In my opinion, they were all bunch of cowards, afraid to stand up in reality. However, when I came back from the sea of LCL, my wife was already waiting for me, and how many people can be as lucky as me?  
我回想起当时的新闻报道，碇真嗣是唯一一个跳入 LCL 海并成功自杀的人。这座雕像就是他的遗作。众所周知，LCL 无法溺死人，但他的尸体从未被找回。因此，人们只能推测他靠着对爱人的强烈思念“融入”了 LCL 之海。讽刺的是，就在新闻报道出来的那天，他的一些狂热粉丝也效仿他，跳入 LCL 之海试图追随他，但无一死亡，后来都被救起。在我看来，他们都是一群逃离现实的懦夫。然而，当我从 LCL 海归来时，我的妻子已经在等我，又有多少人能像我这般幸运呢？

"Then why did he fall into madness only after he finished carving this statue, or Asuka?"  
“那为什么他只在完成这座雕像，或者说，明日香雕像后才陷入疯狂？”

"Because the moment he finished it, he suddenly remembered who Asuka really was." Yukimura said sadly, "And that crushed him. I was right next to him at that very moment. I saw him put down all his carving tools, gazing with great satisfaction at what he thought was his best work, and finally, he embraced the statue, and in a tender voice I had never heard before, he said,  
"因为就在他完工的那一刻，他突然记起了明日香到底是谁。" 幸村悲伤地说，"那段记忆击溃了他。我当时就站在他身边，看到他放下所有的雕刻工具，带着极大的满足感凝视着他自认为最好的那尊雕像，最后，他拥抱着她，用一种我从未听过的温柔声音说道，

'Happy birthday, Asuka .'"  
'明日香，生日快乐。'”

"The moment he called out her name, his face turned pale, his breath turned into gasps, his lips seemed to have developed purpura, and he took a few steps back and covered his face. I tried to help him, but he slammed my hand away, after standing still and trembling for a few seconds, he flung himself at her feet and cried loudly, 'I'm sorry!!! I'm sorry!!!'"  
"就在他呼唤她名字的那一刻，他的脸色变得苍白，呼吸急促，嘴唇似乎发紫了，他后退了几步并捂住了脸。我想过去搀扶他，但他猛地甩开了我的手，在静止颤抖了几秒钟后，他扑倒在她的脚边，大声哭泣，'对不起！！！对不起！！！'”

"My teacher rarely said sorry because he hardly ever did anything sorry. However, on that very day he had been apologizing non-stop to a cold statue he just finished. His voice so mournful, desperate and sad, that God's heart would have broken to hear it. He teared on her legs and feet. I really hoped then that she would come to life, as described in some legends, after sprinkled with the tears of her beloved, but of course no reaction came. Alas, Lilith and Adam, if you were there, please, have pity on my teacher."  
"我的老师很少说对不起，因为他几乎从不做需要道歉的事。然而，就在那天，他不停地向刚刚完成的冰冷雕像道歉。他的声音如此伤悲、绝望和悔恨，连上帝听了都会心碎。他的眼泪止不住地滴落在沉默雕像的腿和脚上。那时我真希望她能像某些传说中描述的那样，在被心爱之人的泪水洒过后复活，但当然，没有任何反应。唉，莉莉丝和亚当，如果你们在场，请可怜可怜我的老师吧。"

"Please tell me, what kind of thing happened between him and the pilot of EVA unit-2?"  
"请告诉我，他和二号 EVA 机驾驶员之间发生了什么事？"

Yukimura closed his eyes, as if he didn't want to share this painful memory with me, even it was his teacher's.  
幸村闭上了眼睛，仿佛不愿与我分享这段痛苦的记忆，即使那是关于他的老师的。

I was already fascinated to hear it, so I took his hand and forced him to look me straight in the eyes.  
我对此感到迷惑，急切地想要探明真相，于是握住他的手，迫使他直视我的眼睛。

"Okay, I'll tell you." 
"好吧，我告诉你。" 

"He killed her with his own hands."  
"他亲手杀了她。" 

I fell back on my chair.  
我跌坐在椅子上。

"What? Are you serious?" 
"什么？你是认真的吗？" 

"I can't believe it either, but it is what Ikari-san told me. He told me himself, and there can be no mistake. He strangled Asuka on the beach. In a panic, he dragged her body back inside the sea of LCL. Her body then disappeared without a trace."  
"我也难以置信，但这是碇先生亲口告诉我的。他亲自说的，绝不会有错。他在海滩上勒死了明日香。慌乱中，他把她的尸体拖回了 LCL 之海。随后她的身体便消失得无影无踪。" 

"Wait, why would he do that?"  
"等等，他为什么要这么做？"

"He hated her ... No, maybe that's too unfair."  
"他恨她……不，也许那样说并不全面。"

Yukimura scanned around, and when he saw that no one was paying attention to us, he pulled an old, rolled-up notebook out of his pocket; I never knew Yukimura had a habit of keeping a diary. I didn't expect him to push it to me and say, "These are Mr. Ikari's own records, and he told me to wait until he was dead before making them public. Read it yourself."  
幸村环顾四周，确认没人注意我们后，从口袋里掏出一本旧的、卷起来的笔记本；我从未知道幸村有记日记的习惯。没想到他把它推给我，说：“这是碇老师自己的记录，他让我等到他去世后再公开。你自己看吧。”

I flipped open the journal and felt my heart drumming heavily.  
我翻开日记本，心跳得沉重有力。

_I woke up that day and it was raining heavily. I was soaked to the skin and I saw Asuka appear beside me. She hadn't been by my side for a few months. I had been alone for all this time. I thought she would have reached out her hand and touched me, even just a touch. However, none of us moved. I opened my mouth as the rain droplets danced on my incisors. I pinned all my hopes on this moment.  
那天醒来，外面正下着大雨。我浑身湿透，看到明日香出现在我身边。她已经好几个月没在我身边了。这段时间我一直独自一人。我希望她会伸出手来触碰我，哪怕只是轻轻一碰。然而，我们谁也没有动弹。雨水滴落在我的门牙上，我张开嘴，将所有的希望寄托在这一刻。_

_"Asuka." I whispered. 
"明日香。"我低声唤道。_

_I waited until the tenth raindrop fell into my expectant eyes, and she still didn't respond to me.  
我等待着，直到第十滴雨落入我满怀期待的双眼，她也依然没有回应。_

_Suddenly I couldn't stand her presence. I jumped up and crouched above her like a lion, strangling her, and I saw her eyes looking straight up at me. She didn't struggle, she wasn't afraid, she just looked at me like that, like she was watching the most horrible drama. The indifference in her eyes made me strangle her even harder.  
突然间我再也无法忍受她的存在。我跳了起来，像狮子一样蹲在她上方，掐住她的脖子，我看到她的眼睛直直地向上看着我。她没有挣扎，她不害怕，她就那样看着我，像在看一出最荒唐的恶戏。她眼里的漠然让我更用力地掐她。_

_Her mask-like expression finally showed a crack, and the painful expression spilled out from her face radiated like hot steam onto my face. Even my tears bruised her. I felt my soul pass through my arms and meet her fiery soul. I was burned by her, knocked back, and I growled shrilly like a young pup crying out for milk. At that moment the rain poured down and thunder struck the sea behind me. I ignored them. I just wanted to know if she would move, if she would plead with me like a woman.  
她那面具般的扑克脸终于出现了裂痕，痛苦的表情从她的脸上喷涌而出，像热蒸汽一样浸润到我的脸上。连我的泪水都伤到了她。我感觉自己的灵魂穿过我的手臂，与她炽热的灵魂相遇。我被她灼伤，被击退，我尖锐地咆哮，像一只哭喊着要奶的小狗。那一刻，大雨倾盆而下，雷电击打在我身后的海上。我无视它们。我只想知道她还会不会动摇，是否要作为一个女性来向我求饶。_

_She didn't. She didn't! I don't know why she didn't. I thought she should have saved me. It had come to this. How could she not save me?  
她不会，她没有！我不知道她为什么不愿这样。我本指望着她会来救我的。事情已经到了这一步，她怎么能不救我呢？_

_By the time I realized it, she had already...  
当我意识到自己正在做什么时，她已经……_

_I ran away and rain chased after me, taking their hateful revenge on my head, rainwater dripping between my mouth and lips. It occurred to me that sooner or later someone would find the body dumped on the beach. So, I turned back. She lay quietly amidst thunder and lightning, in a pool of blood and water, in field surrounded by phantoms of mass-production EVAs, in a hospital bed, in a bathtub. My knees went weak at the sight of her, but I used all my remaining strength to drag her back into the sea of LCL. I pleaded at Lilith: Save her! Please! Lilith just smiled wickedly like that, as if she had expected this to happen.  
我逃离了，雨水紧随其后，以它们那可恨的复仇之姿扑向我，雨水顺着我的嘴角滴落。我突然想到，迟早会有人发现那具被丢弃在海滩上的尸体。于是，我转身回去。她静静地躺在雷电交加之中，血水混杂，四周是大量量产型 EVA 的幻影，她躺在医院的病床上，浴缸里。看到她，我的膝盖一软，但我用尽剩下的全部力气将她拖回了 LCL 之海。我向莉莉丝恳求：救救她！求你了！莉莉丝只是邪恶地笑着，仿佛她早已预料到这一切。_

_The rain poured down and a big wave hit my head. I passed out.  
大雨倾盆而下，一个大浪打在我头上。我昏了过去。_

_When I woke up, I was found by a group of people who set up in a tent on the beach. They were the first "returnees".  
当我醒来时，被一群在海滩上搭帐篷的人发现。他们是第一批“归来者”。_

_That's all that happened. In short, I killed her. Out of an unnamable rage and a cowardly escapism, I killed her. Although I didn't want to do it, she never resisted and kept staring at me like that, this instead making me think she had been alive all along.  
事情就是这样。简而言之，我杀了她。出于一种难以名状的愤怒和懦弱的逃避，我杀了她。虽然我并不想这么做，她却从未反抗，只是那样一直盯着我看，反而让我以为她一直还活着。_

_Some conversations with you made me realized one thing. I must go to her.  
与你的一些对话让我意识到一件事，我必须去找她。_

_Precisely because of my unforgivable sin, I must take responsibility for my actions. Like you said, no one has found her body, and her soul was probably taken back into the sea of LCL by Lilith moments after her death, just like what happened to Misato-san after she pushed me into the elevator. I'm going to find her, and after that she can torture me all she wants.  
正因我犯下了不可饶恕的罪行，我必须为自己的行为负责。正如你所说，没有人找到她的遗体，她的灵魂很可能在她死后被莉莉丝收回 LCL 之海，就像美里小姐推我进电梯后发生的那样。我要找到她，要她在之后尽情地折磨我。_

_As for the statue, although she, like Asuka, refuses to answer all my questions. But when I kissed her this morning, her lips were cold.  
至于那尊雕像，虽然她像明日香一样，拒绝回答我所有的问题。但今早我吻她时，她的唇是冰冷的。_

_She is not MY Asuka. So, I leave her to the world as eternal evidence of my sins.  
她不是我的明日香。所以，我将她留给这个世界，作为我罪行的永恒证据。_

There was a picture stuck in the back of the notebook, and when I looked at it, it was a picture of Mr. Ikari as a teenager on an old aircraft carrier. In front of him was a young girl in a yellow sundress. Because this photo was taken from a distance, the image of the two teenagers is blury. But I could still make out that they were holding hands. "This photo was taken by their friend and classmate - Aida Kensuke, he took this picture of the two of them through a window."  
笔记本的背面贴着一张照片，我一看，是碇先生十几岁时在一艘旧航母上的照片。他面前是一个穿着黄色太阳裙的年轻女孩。因为这张照片是从远处拍摄的，两个青少年的影像有些模糊。但我仍能辨认出他们正手牵手。
"这张照片是他们朋友兼同学——相田剑介拍的，他透过窗户拍下了他们两人的照片。"

I silently returned the notebook to Yukimura. He said, "Today is actually Asuka Soryu Langley's birthday. I purposely chose this day as the opening day for Mr. Ikari's exhibition. Ikari-san also announced the completion of Asuka's statue on her birthday, so it's just about the first anniversary. Let's wish her a happy birthday, if she's still alive."  
我默默地将笔记本还给了幸村。他说：“今天其实是惣流·明日香·兰格雷的生日。我特意选择这一天作为碇先生展览的开幕日。碇先生也在明日香的生日那天宣布了明日香雕像的完成，刚好一周年时间过去了。如果她还活着，让我们祝她生日快乐。”

I said, "... I still don't understand. If they were in love with each other, why would he strangle her? Is he really a murderer?"  
"……我还是不明白。如果他们彼此相爱，他为什么要勒死她？他真的是个凶手吗？"

"He is. However, you did notice that in his story, Asuka didn't resist. If his story is true, then she let him kill herself."  
“他的确这样做了。不过，你注意到在他的叙述中，明日香没有反抗。如果他的故事是真的，那么她是自愿让他杀死自己的。”

"Even so ..." 
"即便如此……"  

"I can't say any more than that. You can savor it again yourself."  
"我不能再说更多了。你再自己去品味吧。"

I looked back at the statue and into the eyes of the pilot of EVA unit-2. This time her expression took on a subtle change in my eyes. I saw a hint of pity hidden behind the anger and hatred.  
我回头望向雕像，凝视着 EVA 二号机的驾驶员的眼睛。这一次，她的表情在我眼中有了微妙的变化。我看到了愤怒和仇恨背后隐藏的一丝怜悯。

Mr. Ikari had hidden this emotion so well that I would not have been able to notice it if I had not read his story.  
碇先生将这种情感隐藏得如此之好，如果不是读过他的故事，我根本无法察觉。

I wanted to retract my previous thought that this work could not be called "a master piece".  
我曾以为这部作品称不上“杰作”，现在我想收回这个想法。

I asked, "Since Mr. Ikari doesn't remember, how did he create it?"  
我问道：“既然碇先生不记得了，那他是如何创作出来的呢？”

"He said that he often dreamed of her. When he felt pain and loneliness in his life, he would feel her hand caressing him and telling him to hold on. She's like his guardian angel."  
"他说他经常梦见她。每当他在生活中感到痛苦和孤独时，他就会感觉到她的手在抚摸着他，告诉他要坚持下去。她就像是他的守护天使。"

I nodded, lost in thought. Yukimura also stopped talking. After that, we went to see the rest of Mr. Ikari 's works. But the statue of the girl and the story behind it kept haunting me till this day.  
我点点头，陷入了沉思。幸村也不再说话。之后，我们去看了碇先生的其他作品。但那个女孩的雕像和它背后的故事一直萦绕在我的心头，时至今日也未曾散去。

In fact, I also had a dream that night.  
事实上，那天晚上我也做了一个梦。

I dreamed of Ikari and Soryu-Langley on the beach. He was strangling her to end her life, she softly caressed his face, Ikari's eyes widened with surprise, and he stopped.  
我梦见了碇和惣流所在的海滩。他正掐住她的脖子结束她的生命，她轻轻抚摸着他的脸颊，碇的眼睛因惊讶而睁大，他停了下来。

Then everything went backwards to the moment they first met.  
然后一切倒流回他们最初相遇的那一刻。

In the years that followed, every time I finished writing, I couldn't help but look out the window and wonder, "Has Mr. Ikari found her?  
在之后的岁月里，每次写完故事，我总会忍不住望向窗外，思索着，*碇先生找到她了吗？*

I would think maybe the two of them are the one who truly gone out of the sea of LCL, and perhaps I never did.  
我想，或许他们俩才是真正从 LCL 之海中走出的人，而我，或许从未真正走出 LCL 之海。

后记：

While I was brainstorming this story, thinking about "what would happen if Shinji really killed Asuka on the beach?" I happened to be listening to Sound Horizon's "The Sculpture of Angel", so I was inspired combined these elements to write such a short story. Enjoy!  
在构思这个故事时，我一直在思考‘如果真嗣真的在海滩上杀死了明日香会发生什么？’，当时正好在听 Sound Horizon 的‘天使的雕像’，于是我受到启发，将这些元素结合起来写成了这样一个短篇。希望你能喜欢！
