A friend of mine on Sufficient Velocity, Shadenight123, was writing a neat little Evangelion AU, where the Angels didn't come for 27 years after Second Impact, not 14, so Shinji was an adult before he was summoned to Tokyo-3. There he met people who were rather different from canon; a Ritsuko who had bargained Gendo into marriage and a child of her own, a Rei who was more at peace with her nature, …and a vibrant redhead who had lost her status as Pilot when her Synch Rate flatlined permanently…  
我在 Sufficient Velocity 上的朋友 Shadenight123 正在写一个有趣的《新世纪福音战士》AU，其中使徒在第二次冲击后 27 年才出现，而不是 14 年，因此真嗣在被召唤到东京-3 之前已经成年。在那里，他遇到了与原作颇为不同的人们：一个通过谈判与源渡结婚并拥有自己孩子的律子，一个对自己的本质更加平和的绫波零，……以及一个因同步率永久平直而失去驾驶员身份的充满活力的红发女子……

…But was forever stuck in a body that looked like a teenager. The 'Curse of Eva' from Rebuild had struck. Rei's nature allowed her to get around it, but not Asuka. Determinedly cheerful, but inwardly lonely, Asuka was afraid that no one would ever look past her frozen youthful appearance. She and Rei once again competed for Shinji's heart, as the Curse of Eva had left all three of them immortal, ageless, and only able to really relate to each other.  
…但永远被困在一个看似青少年的身体里。《新世纪福音战士：序》的‘诅咒’降临了。绫波的本质使她能适应这一点，但明日香却不行。她表面上坚定乐观，内心却孤独无比，害怕没有人会透过她那永远年轻的表象看到真实的她。她和绫波再次为真嗣的心而竞争，因为‘诅咒’使他们三人都获得了永生、不老，并且只能真正地相互理解。

Shadenight123's story is called **Ignis Aurum Probat**, and its well worth looking up on Sufficient Velocity. This is a stand-alone omake I wrote for him, which is not canon, but a speculative piece about how things might go. Enjoy.  
Shadenight123 的故事名为《试金石》，非常值得一读，你可以在 Sufficient Velocity 上找到。这是我为他写的一个独立番外，并非正史，而是对可能发展的一种推测。希望你喜欢。

The glass of the tumblers clinked gently as Asuka set them down on the polished stone surface. She put the bottle of Shinji's favorite whiskey next to the two glasses. Well, in fairness, it was more _her_ favorite whiskey, but he'd grown to at least tolerate it when they drank together, until it was more or less 'their drink' they had together, which suited Asuka just fine.  
玻璃杯轻轻地碰在光滑的石面上，发出清脆的声响。明日香将它们放在那里，旁边还放着一瓶真嗣最喜欢的威士忌。好吧，公平地说，这更多是她喜欢的威士忌，但他已经逐渐能够忍受，当他们一起喝酒时，直到它或多或少成了他们共同的‘他们的酒’，这让明日香感到非常满意。

"Well, this isn't the best weather for us to sit and drink together, my love," Asuka said musingly, looking up at the threatening gray clouds overhead, "but I suppose we can't have everything." She sighed. "It's nice to sit down after a long day and talk to you anyhow." She dropped a couple of ice cubes into each tumbler and poured three fingers of whiskey into each.  
“好吧，这种天气并不适合我们坐下来一起喝酒，亲爱的，”明日香若有所思地说，抬头看着头顶上阴沉的灰色云层，“但我想我们不能拥有一切。”她叹了口气。“经过漫长的一天后坐下来和你聊聊，还是挺不错的。”她往每个杯子里放了几块冰块，然后各自倒了三指高的威士忌。

She sipped half of hers in the first toast. "Ahhh... sweet little burn. See why I like this one, Shinji? 'Smooth, but firey inside, and a nice little kick at the end', isn't that what you said about it once? Then blushed so amusingly when I asked if you meant the whiskey or me?" She laughed, and refilled her drink.  
她第一轮举杯时喝了一半。“啊...甜蜜的小烧灼感。明白我为什么喜欢这个了吧，真嗣？‘平滑，但内心火热，最后还有点小刺激’，这不是你曾经形容过它的吗？然后当我问你是指威士忌还是我时，你脸红得那么有趣？”她笑着，又给自己续了杯。

The conversation went on for a while. Asuka told him about her day, warmth and relaxed intimacy at being with her husband filling every word. Shinji didn't say anything. Asuka was used to this, and wasn't upset by it.  
对话持续了一段时间。明日香向他讲述了她的一天，与丈夫在一起的温暖和放松的亲密感充盈在每一句话中。真嗣没有说什么。明日香对此已经习惯，并没有因此感到不快。

The whiskey in the bottle had dipped towards half-empty before anything interrupted.  
瓶中的威士忌已经接近半空，才有什么事情打断了他们。

"This is not healthy, Soryu."  
“这样不健康，惣流。”

Asuka's hand tightened around her glass until her hand shook and her knuckles were white. "How about you fuck right off, First? I'm having a nice quiet drink with _my husband_. You were not invited."  
明日香的手紧紧握住玻璃杯，直到她的手颤抖，指节发白。“你他妈的滚远点，第一？我和我丈夫正享受着安静的饮品时光。你没被邀请。”

"Soryu, you should not be-"  
“惣流，你不应该——”

"_Shut UP,_ First! I don't want to hear you or your snotty little-"  
“闭嘴，第一！我不想听你或者你那自命不凡的——”

"He's been dead for over 200 years, Asuka..." Rei said gently.  
“他已经去世两百多年了，明日香……”绫波温柔地说道。

The only sound in the graveyard was the distant rustle of dead leaves flung around by the wind.  
墓园中唯一的声响是远处枯叶被风卷起的沙沙声。

Slowly, Asuka carefully put the now empty tumbler down beside it's mate on the gravestone. She left the half-empty bottle there, along with the untouched second drink she had poured at the beginning. She brushed a couple of leaves off the polished black marble of the gravestone that read _Shinji Ikari Soryu, 2001-2028, Beloved Husband & Hero of Tokyo-3._ She stood up smoothly, no sign in her motion or face that she'd drunk half a bottle of whiskey on an empty stomach, in a body that was forever not even 16.  
缓缓地，明日香小心翼翼地将空杯放在墓碑旁与另一只杯子并排。她留下了半瓶未喝完的威士忌，以及一开始倒好却未曾动过的第二杯酒。她拂去墓碑上抛光黑色大理石上的几片落叶，上面刻着碇真嗣·惣流，2001-2028，东京-3 的英雄与挚爱的丈夫。她优雅地站起身，无论是动作还是面容，都看不出她曾在空腹状态下喝下半瓶威士忌，而她的身体永远停留在不足 16 岁的状态。

She gave Ayanami a tired, hate-filled glare. "Go fuck yourself, First. Didn't you have anything _better_ you could do than come harass me? Today, of all days? Our fucking _anniversary_? You couldn't leave me even that?" she said tiredly. She pulled her long, dark trenchcoat around her thin form a little tighter. The rising wind whipped her long red hair around her face, obscuring her features.  
她向绫波投去一个疲惫而充满恨意的瞪视。“去你妈的，第一。你难道没有比来骚扰我更好的事情可做吗？偏偏是今天？我们的该死纪念日？你连这个都不能留给我吗？”她疲惫地说道。她将那件长长的深色风衣裹紧自己瘦削的身体。升起的狂风将她长长的红发吹得在脸庞周围飞舞，遮住了她的面容。

Rei just stared back at her, a bleak expression on her pale face. The wind ruffled the fur collar of her dark brown leather bomber jacket. She shook her head sadly. "I am aware of what day it is, Soryu. That is in fact why I came. I knew you would be here, doing something like this. I w-"  
绫波只是回望着她，苍白的脸上带着一种阴郁的表情。风吹乱了她深棕色皮革飞行夹克的毛领。她悲伤地摇了摇头。“我知道今天是什么日子，惣流。那正是我来这里的原因。我知道你会在这里，做这样的事。我……”

"I don't _care_ if you think 'this isn't healthy'!" Asuka snarled at her. She balled her hands into fists that shook at her sides. "One hundred days! One hundred _fucking_ days! That's all we had together! One hundred days from the happiest day of our lives until I was a _God damned_ _**widow**_!" Asuka dropped to her knees for a second to pick up a small stone. She rose again to fling it at Rei, striking her in the chest. "How dare you tell me I can't spend a little time talking to my husband, _like I should be doing right now_! Like I should have been able to do every day for the last 223 years!" Tears slicked her cheeks now.  
“我不在乎你认为‘这不健康’！”明日香对她咆哮道。她紧握双拳，拳头在身侧颤抖。“一百天！整整一百天！这就是我们在一起的全部时间！从我们生命中最快乐的一天到我成为该死的寡妇！”明日香跪下片刻，捡起一块小石头。她再次起身，朝绫波扔去，击中了她的胸口。“你怎么敢告诉我不能花点时间和我丈夫说话，就像我现在应该做的那样！就像过去 223 年里我每天应该能做的那样！”泪水此刻滑过她的脸颊。

Rei didn't react to the stone. "I'm sorry."  
丽对石头毫无反应。“对不起。”

"Like Hell you are! He chose _me! Me_! He said yes and married me and we were _happy_ and then that _fucking Angel_ came..." Asuka stopped, swallowing hard.  
"你才不是！他选的是我！是我！他答应了，娶了我，我们曾经很幸福，然后那个该死的使徒出现了……" 明日香顿住，艰难地咽了咽口水。

"You think I would ever forget, Soryu?" Rei replied quietly. "He died saving us both. And yes, I was envious. I loved him too. But he chose you, and all of NERV could see how happy you both were."  
"你觉得我会忘记吗，惣流？" 绫波平静地回答，"他为了救我们俩而死。是的，我也很嫉妒。我也爱他。但他选择了你，NERV 的所有人都能看出你们是多么幸福。

"So why are you _here_, First? Is your only happiness seeing how miserable I am without him? If you are just here to play ficken Ghul, you can piss right off and leave me alone with him."  
"那你来这里干嘛，第一适格者？你唯一的乐趣就是看我有多痛苦吗？如果你只是来玩弄人心的恶鬼，那就滚远点，让我和他单独待着。

"Because I know he would not want you to do what I know you are here to do. Because I know what you have in your pocket," Rei said without inflection.  
"因为我知道他不会希望你做我知道你来这里要做的事。因为我知道你口袋里有什么，" 丽毫无感情地说道。

Asuka's shoulders slumped. "You fucking busybody," she said tiredly. "You can't even let me have that?"  
明日香的肩膀垂了下来。"你这个多管闲事的家伙，" 她疲惫地说道。"你连这个都不能让我自己决定吗？"

"Soryu-" "惣流-"

"It never fucking _stops hurting_, First. Never. Not for one goddam second in 223 years. He said yes, he loved me, and we had eternity together ahead of us. I even promised him I'd stop being a bitch to you and be good, since we all had years on years ahead with each other." She put her hand on the top of the headstone and leaned heavily against it. "I'm just so damn tired..."  
"它从未停止过痛苦，First。从未。223 年来，连一秒钟都没有停止过。他说过他爱我，我们还有永恒的未来。我甚至答应过他，我会停止对你刻薄，变得好一些，因为我们都有无数岁月要一起度过。" 她把手放在墓碑顶上，重重地倚靠在上面。"我只是太累了..."

"You are not alone, Soryu. Myself, the others at NERV-" Rei began.  
"你并不孤单，惣流。我自己，NERV 的其他人——" 绫波开始说道。

"What 'others', First?! Shinji's dead! Misato's dead! Gendo and Ritsuko and everyone we fought with are dead! Their _kids_ are all dead! Their _grandkids_ are all dead! There is no one left in this world but you and me that remember his face or his voice or anyone else back then. Just you and me, the immortal ghosts at the feast, forever reminding people that see us that a secret cabal of lunatics once tried to play god! And I am sick and tired of it!"  
"什么‘其他人’，第一！真嗣死了！美里死了！源堂和律子还有我们一起战斗过的所有人都死了！他们的孩子都死了！他们的孙子也都死了！这个世界上只剩下你和我记得他的脸或他的声音，或是那时候的任何人。只有你和我，这场盛宴中不朽的幽灵，永远提醒着那些看到我们的人，曾经有一群疯狂的秘密团体试图扮演上帝！我真是受够了！"

Thunder grumbled in the distance and the wind kicked up another notch. "I know you doing this would make him sad, Soryu. Please do not."  
远处雷声隆隆，风势又增强了几分。"我知道你这么做会让他难过，惣流。请不要这样做。"

Asuka looked away from her, at the approaching storm. "You're just afraid of being truly alone. And I just want to see my husband again." She pulled the small black handgun out of her pocket. She cradled it loosely in her hand, pointing it at the ground beside the grave.  
明日香移开目光，望向逼近的风暴。“你只是害怕真正地孤独一人。而我只是想再见我的丈夫一面。”她从口袋里掏出那把小巧的黑色手枪。她随意地握着它，枪口指向墓旁的地面上。

"There has to be another way."  
“一定还有别的办法。”

Asuka shook her head slowly. "You don't think I've _tried_, First? I spent 24 years getting a PhD and pushing at the edges of physics in the desperate hope I could somehow invent a _time machine_, in the hope I could go back and save him."  
明日香缓缓摇头。“你以为我没试过吗，First？我花了 24 年时间攻读博士学位，拼命在物理学的边缘探索，绝望地希望能发明一台时光机，希望能回到过去救他。”

"A time machine?" Rei said, raising an eyebrow.  
"时光机？" 丽挑了挑眉。

Asuka frowned at her. "I told you, I tried everything. It even worked. It was just useless."  
明日香皱眉看着她。"我告诉过你，我什么都试过了。它甚至成功了。只是毫无用处。"

"What?" "什么？"

She looked back at the storm. "I ended up building two, actually. The first one can't go any further back in time than the moment it was completed, so it's kind of useless unless I really wanted to revisit spring of 2147 again. Which I don't. And the second one... all the math works, but there's the slight problem that the wormhole isn't stable unless I can channel at least five percent of the _Sun's annual output_ worth of energy into it, so fat lot of good that is." Asuka looked back at Rei. "So yes, First, I looked for other ways. While you were sitting on your ass. So unless you've got a working time machine of your own in your back pocket or something, I'm again going to kindly ask you to fuck off and let me take the only way out our stupid, ageless bodies will allow me."  
她回头望向风暴。“实际上，我最终造了两台。第一台最多只能回到它完工的那一刻，所以除非我真的想重温 2147 年的春天，否则它没什么用。我可不想。至于第二台……所有计算都没问题，但有个小问题，虫洞不稳定，除非我能引导至少太阳年输出能量的百分之五进去，所以那也没什么卵用。”明日香转头看向丽。“所以没错，首先，我寻找了其他方法。而你却坐在那儿无所事事。所以除非你口袋里藏着一台能用的时光机或者别的什么，我再次礼貌地请你滚开，让我采取这唯一能让我们这该死的、永葆青春的身体解脱的方法。”

"I am not here to stop you because I fear being alone, Soryu."  
“我并非因为害怕孤单才来阻止你，曹长。”

"So why, then? It can't be because we're such close friends," Asuka said bitterly. "Get to the point. My husband is waiting for me, and I've missed him for too long."  
"那又是为什么呢？总不会是因为我们关系有多好吧，"明日香苦涩地说道，"直说吧。我丈夫还在等我，我已经太久没见到他了。"

Rei cocked her head. "Do you think I've been idle? I told you, I loved him too. He may have chosen you, but I would... I want to see him again too."  
丽依歪了歪头。“你以为我一直在闲着吗？我告诉过你，我也爱他。他可能选择了你，但我...我也想再见他一面。”

Asuka glowered at her. "What, you've _got_ a working time machine in your back pocket?"  
明日香瞪着她。“怎么，你口袋里藏着一台能用的时光机？”

When Rei did not say anything after a moment, Asuka's frown deepened. She raised the pistol and aimed at Rei. "I swear to fucking Gott, First, if you are fucking with me I _will_ shoot you first. This is _not_ a topic to jerk me around on."  
当 Rei 片刻后仍未出声，Asuka 的眉头皱得更紧了。她举起手枪，对准了 Rei。“我向上帝发誓，首先，如果你在耍我，我会先开枪打你。这不是可以随便糊弄我的话题。”

Rei didn't even flinch. If anything, the look she gave Asuka was almost annoyed. "Come on, Soryu. Have you forgotten I am more than I appear? As if mere bullets can threaten me?" A momentary flicker of a transparent orange octagon flashed in between them.  
丽连眼都没眨一下。如果说有什么表情的话，她看向明日香的眼神几乎带着一丝不耐烦。“来吧，惣流。你难道忘了我远不止表面那么简单吗？区区子弹怎能威胁到我？”一瞬间，一个透明的橙色八角形在他们之间闪现。

"Get to the damn point, bitch." Asuka still lowered the gun.  
“说重点，贱人。”明日香依然放低了枪。

"I have been... exploring what my greater body can do. I have told no one, not even the R&D staff at NERV or the caretakers that are even permitted near Lilith's chamber. But... there are certain... facets of quantum mechanics that AT-Fields at high strength can affect. I have... achieved repeatable, stable feeds of unprecedented levels of negative energy and reverse causality. I have made only limited progress, but if you truly have a fully mathematically worked out wormhole process..."  
“我一直在……探索我这副更强大的身体能做什么。我没有告诉任何人，甚至连 NERV 的研发人员或被允许接近莉莉丝房间的看护者都没有透露。但是……某些量子力学的方面，高强度的 AT 力场可以影响。我……实现了前所未有的负能量和反因果关系的可重复、稳定供给。我只有有限的进展，但如果你真的有一个完全数学上可行的虫洞过程……”

"I do." "我愿意。"

"Then we may have something worth exploring."  
"那么我们或许有些值得探索的东西。"

Asuka did not look very convinced. "What's the point? My research on the first time machine kind of confirmed that the past is an unalterable quantum monoblock. Unless we create a stable time loop, there's no point. And you and I both _remember_ him dying. I held his body!"  
明日香看起来并不十分信服。“这有什么意义呢？我关于第一台时间机器的研究基本上证实了过去是一个不可改变的量子单体。除非我们能创造一个稳定的时间循环，否则毫无意义。而且你我都记得他死去的那一刻。我抱着他的尸体！”

"The systems once employed to record my mind and copy it for the Dummy Plugs and my clones have advanced considerably since those versions. A portable, rapid model is available for emergency medical use on the dying. We have Shinji's DNA still on record. And as Lilith, I can salvage and hold his soul. If your wormhole work combines with my negative energy studies effectively, we may be able to... save enough of him to resurrect him here on our return. We just stay unobserved and the past is as we remember it. We will still have the past two centuries of pain to withstand, but..."  
"那些曾经用于记录我的思维并复制到 Dummy Plugs 和我的克隆体上的系统，自那些版本以来已经有了显著的进步。现在有一种便携式、快速的模型，可用于濒死者的紧急医疗。我们仍然保留着真嗣的 DNA 记录。而作为莉莉丝，我可以挽救并保存他的灵魂。如果你的虫洞研究与我的负能量研究有效结合，我们或许能够……保存足够的他来在这里复活他。只要我们不被察觉，过去就会如我们所记忆的那样。我们仍需承受过去两个世纪的痛苦，但是……"

"We'd have him back. Mind, body, and soul. My Shinji," Asuka breathed. She clamped her eyes shut, but a steady flow of tears escaped anyway. "I swear on _his grave_, First, if you are lying to me one bit, I will kill you slowly."  
"我们就能让他回来。心灵、肉体和灵魂。我的真嗣，" 明日香轻声说道。她紧闭双眼，但泪水依然不断涌出。"我以他的墓起誓，第一，如果你有半点谎言，我会让你慢慢死去。"

"Have I lied to you even once since his death?"  
"自从他死后，我有对你说过一次谎吗？"

"No. Which is why you're not bleeding from a dozen gunshot wounds already." Asuka put the gun away back in her pocket. "Alright, I'm in. There is nothing I won't try to be able to see him again... Rei."  
“不。这就是为什么你还没有被十几处枪伤流血致死的原因。”明日香将枪放回口袋。“好吧，我加入。为了能再次见到他，我愿意尝试一切……绫波。”

Rei smiled very faintly. "Nor I. You are not the only one who misses him. You never have been."  
绫波微微一笑。“我也是。你并不是唯一一个想念他的人。你从来都不是。”

Asuka lovingly brushed her hand across the tombstone one more time, then walked towards Rei. "He's still mine," she said, walking past the blue-haired clone.  
明日香深情地再次抚摸了一下墓碑，然后走向绫波。“他还是我的，”她走过蓝发克隆体时说道。

Rei fell in step next to her. "I stop you from putting a bullet through your head, offer you a chance at saving him, and you still say I can't even lay a finger on him?"  
绫波与她并肩而行。“我阻止你朝自己脑袋开枪，给你一个救他的机会，你却还说我连碰他一下都不行？”

Asuka snorted. "Rei, if this works, I'll even let you have a full damn night with him. But he's still my one and only husband, and I'm keeping him. Now let's go break spacetime and save him."  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“绫波，如果这能成功，我甚至可以让你和他共度一整晚。但他依然是我唯一的丈夫，我要留住他。现在，让我们去打破时空，救他吧。”

"It will not be that simple. This could take years to get the process to work," Rei cautioned.  
"事情不会那么简单。这个过程可能需要数年才能成功," 丽警告道。

"All we've got is time, Blue. I don't care if this takes decades if it means I'll get to feel him in my arms again at the end."  
"我们拥有的就是时间，蓝。如果这意味着最终我能再次将他拥入怀中，我不在乎这需要几十年。"

"Then let us begin." "那么，让我们开始吧。"

Thunder grumbled again as the two ageless ex-Pilots walked out of the graveyard overlooking the city of Tokyo-3 and the valley lake below. It was softer now. The storm had diverted east, and rain no longer threatened.  
雷声再次低沉地响起，两位永恒的前驾驶员走出了俯瞰东京-3 市和下方山谷湖的墓园。现在雷声变得柔和了。风暴已经转向东边，不再有雨水的威胁。
