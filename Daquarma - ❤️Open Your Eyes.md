_About This Story_: This is my theory of what the series would be like if Asuka and Shinji had gotten together. I'm not _that_ much of an A/S fan; neither do I support A/R's cause that would be gross. Imagine going out with a clone of your mom. I'd have _fraggin_ nightmares. I also feel the need to warn you that this is intended to be a serious story, so if you laugh while reading this story you are _so_ sick in the _head_. I _guess_ that's a _good_ enough introduction and _abuse_ of _italics_. Enjoy my mind's excretement, so to speak. =)~  
关于这个故事：这是我对明日香和真嗣若在一起，系列可能呈现的面貌的设想。我并非 A/S（明日香/真嗣）的拥趸，更不支持 A/R（明日香/薰），那实在令人作呕。想象与自己母亲的克隆体交往，简直噩梦连连。我得声明，这故事是严肃的，若你读时发笑，那你心智可真够扭曲的。我想这介绍和斜体字的运用已足够充分。尽情品味我思想的产物吧，这么说吧。=)~

Shinji lay in his bed on the floor, his SDAT playing in his ears. His eyes were closed but he was awake, trying to sleep. It was aggravating, attempting to fall into unconsciousness but failing miserably. Now he lay awake, thinking hard about sleeping, thinking about how comfortable he is, about how warm his mattress was. Yet he couldn't drift off. The SDAT switched sides on the tape and continued playing for the fifth time.  
真嗣躺在地铺上，耳边是 SDAT 的播放声。他闭着眼，却清醒着，努力想要入睡。尝试进入梦乡却屡遭挫败，这让他颇为烦躁。此刻他清醒地躺着，思索着如何入睡，感受着身下的舒适与温暖。但就是难以入眠。SDAT 第五次换面，继续播放着。

It must have been about 3am now. Shinji's eyes were strained. He was starting to get a little too warm and uncomfortable. It was unnerving. Misato was asleep in the other room and Asuka was in the room beside his. Both of them were silent. Was he the only one awake? Why him? Why couldn't he sleep soundly each night like everyone else? Somehow Shinji knew that the answers lay within the Eva. Within Nerv. Within his nightmares about the Angels and within himself. His numerous battles against the Angels played in his mind like a fuzzy television set. He could feel the anger he felt in that bloody entry plug. He could feel the trigger clasped tightly in his fingers. He could feel the pressure of the progressive blade being plunged into the blood-drop core of the angel. He'd seen more than his share of blood and gore, yet he was still the third child. Why? Why go on? These thoughts played in his mind, slowly drifting him off towards sleep. Sweet glorious sleep. It was inches away.  
现在大概是凌晨 3 点。真嗣感到眼睛疲劳，身体开始发热，感觉不适。这种不安让他难以平静。美里在另一个房间熟睡，明日香也在隔壁房间安静地休息。难道只有他醒着吗？为什么偏偏是他无法像别人那样每晚安然入睡？真嗣隐约觉得答案藏在 Eva、NERV、他关于天使的噩梦以及他自己之中。他与天使的激战在脑海中如同一台信号不佳的电视般回放。他能感受到在那血腥驾驶舱中的怒火，紧握扳机的手指，以及将渐进式刀片刺入天使核心时的压迫感。 他目睹的血腥与恐怖已远超常人，却依旧是家中的老三。为何如此？又为何要继续前行？这些思绪在他心中萦绕，缓缓将他带入梦乡。那甜美而辉煌的睡眠，触手可及。

Shinji saw a light go on through his eyelids. His eyes snapped open as he saw the slender silhouette of Asuka disappear into the bathroom. The door gently shut as the beam of light shrank into an outline of the bathroom door. Shinji groaned and turned over, facing the wall. Slowly, agonizingly, he tried to fall asleep again. The SDAT slipped of the mattress onto the floor in a small thud, and stopped playing. Shinji remained silent, unwilling to open his eyes again to check on the SDAT. The gentle, deliberately slow wave of sleep washed over him once more.  
真嗣透过眼皮察觉到灯光亮起。他猛地睁开眼，瞥见明日香苗条的身影闪入浴室。随着光束缩成浴室门的轮廓，门轻轻地关上了。真嗣发出一声呻吟，转身面向墙壁。他艰难地尝试再次入睡。SDAT 从床垫滑落，掉在地板上发出轻微声响，随即停止播放。真嗣沉默着，不愿再次睁眼查看 SDAT。渐渐地，一股缓慢而温柔的睡意再次笼罩了他。

Shinji returned to full awareness once more as the sound of a toilet flushing rumbled in his ears. (Damn Asuka) Shinji cursed as the bathroom door opened once more. Clenching his teeth, Shinji attempted, for the third time in this night that stretched on like an eternity, to fall asleep. Soft footsteps could be heard trailing slowly. He imagined Asuka walking back to her bed without opening his eyes. She was beautiful, even in his thoughts. If only she wasn't such a bitch sometimes. Shinji was convinced that Asuka has a softer, more gentle and sensitive side. If she were to let it out, Shinji would've liked her much more. At the verge of desperation to fall asleep, Shinji thought about Asuka.  
真嗣再次清醒过来，耳边是马桶冲水的轰鸣。（可恶的明日香）他暗骂一声，浴室门再次开启。咬紧牙关，在这个漫漫长夜中，他第三次尝试入睡。轻柔的脚步声缓缓传来。他闭着眼想象明日香走回床边。即便在想象中，她依旧美丽动人。要是她不那么刻薄就好了。真嗣坚信明日香内心藏着温柔与敏感。若她能展现这一面，他定会更加倾心。在入睡的边缘挣扎时，真嗣的思绪飘向了明日香。

A ruffling of blankets could be heard. (She must be in bed). Shinji begin to drift off into sleep again, unaware that something was pulling at his blanket, and it was slowly sliding off his waist. Shinji felt a chill on his skin and rolled over, not opening his eyes, and groped for his blanket. He found it and pulled it over him. Something pleasantly warm moved towards his body. It wasn't until Shinji felt a warm leg brush against his thigh that he realized he wasn't alone. He opened his eyes to find Asuka Langley Shoryu's face an inch from his.  
可以听到毯子被翻动的声音。（她肯定在床上）。真嗣再次开始进入梦乡，未察觉到有什么东西正悄悄拉扯他的毯子，毯子正缓缓从腰间滑落。真嗣感到一阵寒意，便闭着眼睛翻身，摸索着抓住毯子，将其拉回身上。此时，一股温暖的气息向他靠近。直到真嗣感觉到一条温暖的腿轻触他的大腿，他才意识到并非独自一人。他睁开眼，发现明日香·兰格雷的脸近在咫尺。

### Chapter 2: And See
The shock begin to fade away. It was dark, and the shadows were playing tricks on his eyes. He couldn't see for certain if Asuka's eyes were open. But then again, he reasoned, if they were, he'd probably be dead by now. The earphones tugged and slipped from his ears. Now the white silence of the night could be heard, along with Asuka's slow, gentle breaths. Shinji steered his eyes downwards, surveying his unexpected companion. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt that was much too big for her. The collar drooped down to above her chest, revealing the top curves of her breasts. Shinji held his breath. Slowly, his eyes moved downwards. Her boxers were half hidden by her large shirt. Shinji exhaled as slowly as he could.  
震惊感逐渐消散。四周漆黑一片，阴影在眼前捉弄着他的视线。他无法确定明日香是否睁开了眼睛。但再一想，如果她醒着，自己可能早已遭遇不测。耳机被拽落，从耳边滑脱。此刻，夜的静谧清晰可闻，夹杂着明日香平稳而轻柔的呼吸。真嗣垂下目光，打量着这位不期而至的伙伴。她身着一件对她而言过大的无袖衬衫，领口低垂至胸前，隐约可见胸部的轮廓。真嗣屏息凝视，目光缓缓下移。她的短裤半遮半掩在宽大的衬衫之下。真嗣尽量缓慢地呼出一口气。

Shinji was just about to get up and sleep on the floor when Asuka sidled closer to him, her face moving towards his. Her slender legs where against his thighs and he could feel her soft, smooth skin pressed against his. He could feel her warmth radiating onto him. Her nose was pressed against his cheek. Her slightly parted lips were about a centimeter away from his, and Shinji could feel her warm breath on his lips. One sudden move, and their lips would be pressed against each other. Shinji couldn't deny that he was tempted.  
真嗣正打算起身去睡地板，不料明日香悄然靠近，脸庞贴近他的。她修长的双腿紧贴着他的大腿，他能感受到她肌肤的柔软与光滑。她的温暖仿佛能穿透他的身体。她的鼻尖轻触他的脸颊，微启的唇瓣离他的仅咫尺之遥，真嗣能感觉到她温热的呼吸轻抚他的唇。只需一个动作，他们的唇便会紧紧相依。真嗣无法否认，他被深深吸引。

Shinji moved his hand across her waist, softly placing his wrist along her hip. As if by reaction, Asuka's hand slid behind Shinji, her fingers resting limply along his back. Shinji was uncertain if she was pretending to sleep, but if she were her acting was beautiful. Shinji moved his hands upwards, trailing her long red hair, taking in the softness. It was not unlike fine silk, cool and smooth between his fingers… like water.  
真嗣的手轻柔地掠过她的腰间，手腕轻搭在她的髋部。明日香似乎本能地回应，她的手滑至真嗣背后，手指轻轻贴在他的背上。真嗣不确定她是否在装睡，但若真是如此，她的演技可谓天衣无缝。真嗣的手缓缓上移，抚摸着她那如瀑的红发，感受着那份柔顺。它宛如上乘的丝绸，在指间凉滑细腻，仿佛流水般顺滑。

"Shinji…" 真嗣……

Shinji was still for a moment. It was a while until he was certain that Asuka was just talking in her sleep. She had called his name. Was she dreaming about him? If so what dream was it? Her fingers were a little tense against his back. It was as if she was gripping him. She softly muttered something unintelligible as her fingernails dug gently into his shirt and eventually relaxed and settled again, resting against his back. Her other arm slid underneath his neck  
碇真嗣静立片刻。过了许久，他才确信明日香只是在说梦话。她呼唤了他的名字。难道她梦见了他？那会是怎样的梦境呢？她的手指紧贴他的背，略显僵硬，仿佛在紧握着他。她轻声呢喃着含糊不清的话语，指甲轻柔地嵌入他的衬衫，随后逐渐放松，再次安然地倚靠在他的背上。她的另一只手臂悄然滑至他的颈下。

Both her arms were around him now, holding him in a gentle hug. Shinji closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. What was he doing? Was he really taking advantage of someone asleep? What was this feeling? It was growing inside him yet he couldn't identify it. What would happen if people found out? Would they hate him? Shinji opened his eyes and involuntarily exhaled, sending waves of hot air all over Asuka's face.  
此刻，她的双臂正环绕着他，温柔地拥抱着。真嗣闭上双眼，深深吸了一口气。他到底在做什么？难道真的在趁人熟睡之际占便宜吗？这股涌动在心头的情感究竟是什么？他无法辨识。万一被人发现，他们会因此憎恨他吗？真嗣睁开眼，不由自主地呼出一口热气，热浪直扑明日香的面庞。

Asuka's eyes snapped open. Shinji could see her pupils shrink as they adsorbed the situation. She opened her mouth to say something, but was cut off when Shinji crushed his lips against hers. What motivated him to do so, he would never really understand. But he did. Asuka's eyes grew wider but soon begin to shut and eventually close completely. She was locked in a passionate embrace with Shinji Ikari, and she was enjoying it. Slowly, she slid her tongue into his mouth, exploring him. His tongue met hers, and they lapped together in a slow, graceful dance. Shinji pushed his tongue past hers, discovering her, savoring her taste. Shinji's arms were pressing her towards him, and her arms were rummaging his hair, pushing his face greedily into hers, wanting this moment of heated passion and bliss and primal ecstasy to never end.  
明日香的眼睛突然睁大。真嗣注意到她的瞳孔因适应环境而缩小。她正要开口，却被真嗣突如其来的吻堵住了嘴。他为何会这么做，他自己也说不清楚。但这一吻确实发生了。明日香的眼睛先是瞪大，随后渐渐闭合，直至完全闭上。她与碇真嗣沉浸在热烈的拥抱中，享受着这份亲密。她缓缓伸出舌头，探入他的口中，与他交缠。两人的舌头在一场缓慢而优雅的舞蹈中相互缠绵。真嗣的舌头越过她的，深入探索，品味着她的独特滋味。 真嗣用双臂紧紧抱住她，她的手则在他发丝间游走，急切地将他的脸压向自己，渴望这充满激情与幸福、原始狂喜的时刻永不结束。

Their lips parted eventually, and they stared at each other over the veil of darkness, both their moist lips curved in a smile. Asuka sidled closer to him, her head resting against his chest, as Shinji pulled the blankets over both of them, and they slept in each other's embrace until the sun rose the next morning. It was on that night that Shinji Ikari, 14 year old Evangelion Pilot and destined Third Child, fell in love with Asuka Langley Shoryu.  
他们的唇终于分开，隔着黑暗的薄纱彼此凝望，两人湿润的唇边都挂着微笑。明日香依偎过去，头枕在他的胸前，真嗣则拉起毯子覆盖两人，他们就这样相拥入眠，直至次日清晨阳光洒落。就在那一夜，14 岁的福音战士驾驶员、注定成为第三适格者的碇真嗣，爱上了明日香·兰格雷·索尔。

I have no idea when in the series this happened. Don't ask. Its my first ever fanfiction so don't blam me too hard.  
我不确定这一幕在系列中的具体时间，别追问了。这是我首次尝试写同人小说，还请手下留情。

### Chapter 3: I'm Just A Poor Boy
Shinji noticed a considerable change in Asuka's attitude over the next few weeks. She was nicer now, especially to her Shinji. Perhaps being in love really did change a person's personality. She never answered Shinji rudely, except for the occasional baka-Shinji. But that was always with a loving tone and a smile. She hardly lost her temper anymore. She even glowed with a certain aura that portrayed her inner happiness and content. She was, as Shinji now came to realize, sweet.  
真嗣发现，接下来的几周里，明日香的态度有了明显转变。她变得更加亲切，尤其是对真嗣。或许爱情真的能改变人的本性。她不再粗暴地回应真嗣，偶尔的“笨蛋真嗣”也总是带着爱意和微笑。她几乎不再发火，身上还散发着一种彰显内心幸福与满足的光芒。真嗣逐渐意识到，她变得温柔可人了。

Both their sync ratios were overwhelming. Ritsuko and Misato were pleased. Shinji and Asuka never said anything, but they both knew who they were thinking about during those quiet hours in the entry plug. Asuka was now genuinely concern about Shinji's well-being, and she refused to hide it from anyone. It was obvious, of course, to spectators and friends and family. Toji and Kensuke could not hide their disbelief after watching the couple stroll into the classroom hand-in-hand. Both of them took turns questioning Shinji about his sanity, but mellowed down after noticing Asuka's nicer side.  
他们的同步率都高得惊人。律子和美里对此感到满意。真嗣和明日香虽未明言，但在插入栓中静默的时刻，彼此心知肚明对方所思。明日香如今真心担忧真嗣的安危，她不愿向任何人隐瞒这份关心。旁观者、朋友和家人都看得一清二楚。当这对情侣手牵手走进教室时，东治和健介难掩惊讶之情。他们轮番质疑真嗣的理智，但在察觉到明日香的温柔一面后，态度逐渐软化。

They slept in the same bed each night. Misato didn't mind. In fact she encouraged it. In Misato's opinion, Shinji's confidence could increase with the help of a special friend. Maybe that's what they both needed, someone to love and to be by loved in return. Misato knew that they could handle themselves. They were, after all, mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions. Shinji never tried anything though, and Asuka respected that. Both had a silent agreement that they would not proceed to the next step until they were both prepared and ready. And at the age of fourteen, they were certainly neither. So they just slept, content with each other's company every night, and happy to be able to hold on to something other than the Evangelions.  
他们每晚同榻而眠，Misato 对此并不介意，反而鼓励这种做法。她认为，Shinji 的自信或许能通过一位特殊朋友的陪伴而增强。或许，他们都需要这样的爱与被爱。Misato 深知他们已足够成熟，能理解自己行为的后果。尽管如此，Shinji 始终保持尊重，Asuka 亦是如此。两人间有默契，除非双方都准备好，否则不会迈出下一步。毕竟，十四岁的他们还未成熟至此。于是，他们每晚只是相拥而眠，满足于彼此的陪伴，享受着除 Evangelions 之外的另一种依靠。

Shinji rushed towards Nerv headquarters as every speaker in Tokyo-3 blared out warnings that an emergency had been declared. Everyone was safe in the shelters, and Shinji was running as fast as possible. Asuka and Rei were nowhere in sight. He was separated from them during the evacuation in school. Shinji guessed that they were already at headquarters. They were probably with the fourth child. Shinji had no idea who he or she was, but he didn't seem to want to know. Today was the first activation test for the fifth Evangelion. Shinji would have a new colleague. Nerv would have a new Eva. Shinji was wondering if it was a coincidence that the Angel chose today for its attack.  
真嗣急忙奔向 NERV 总部，东京-3 的每个扬声器都在回荡着紧急状态已宣布的警告。所有人都已安全进入避难所，而真嗣正竭尽全力地奔跑。明日香和绫波不见踪影，他们在学校疏散时走散了。真嗣推测她们可能已经到达总部，或许正与第四适格者在一起。对于这位第四适格者，真嗣一无所知，也无意深究。今天是第五号福音战士的首次启动测试，真嗣将迎来一位新搭档，NERV 也将迎来新的 EVA。真嗣心中疑惑，天使选择今天发动攻击，是否只是巧合。

The automated doors slid open as Shinji ran through the corridor, into the locker room. After changing into his plug suit, he was loaded into the entry plug an finally into Eva-01. The Eva began to taxi towards the catapults, where Eva-00 and Eva-02 were waiting for launch. Shinji wondered where Eva-05 was. He contacted Asuka. Her face appeared in an orange square to his right. She looked extremely grim.  
自动门随着真嗣疾跑穿过走廊而开启，他随即进入更衣室。换上驾驶服后，他被装入插入栓，最终进入初号机。初号机开始向弹射器驶去，零号机和二号机已在等待发射。真嗣纳闷五号机的去向。他联系了明日香，她的面容随即出现在他右侧的橙色屏幕上，神情异常凝重。

"What's wrong Asuka-chan?" he asked, concerned.  
"飞鸟酱，怎么了？" 他关切地问。

"You don't know?" she raised an eyebrow.  
"你不知道？" 她挑眉问道。

Before he could ask "Know what?" they were launched upwards. Shinji decided to ask questions later. Destroying the Angel was his first priority.  
他还没来得及问“知道什么？”，他们就被弹射升空了。真嗣决定先把问题搁置，消灭使徒才是当务之急。

"Where's the Angel, Misato-san?"  
天使在哪儿，美里小姐？

Maya's voice came through.  
玛雅的声音传了过来。

"Its not an Angel. The target is Eva-05"  
这不是天使。目标对象是 Eva-05

"What?! What happened?! Where's Misato?"  
什么？！出什么事了？！美里在哪儿？

Maya explained briefly about the explosion, and how the Eva went berserk.  
玛雅简要说明了爆炸的情况，以及伊娃为何会发狂。

"Misato…What about the pilot?!"  
Misato…飞行员那边怎么处理?!

"We have no information at this point. All we know is that the ejection was not confirmed, and that the pilot is still within the Eva."  
目前我们尚未掌握任何信息。据我们所知，弹射并未得到证实，飞行员仍在 Eva 内部。

"The pilot is still in there?" asked Shinji, bewildered. "A pilot… a person my age… I wonder who he is…"  
飞行员还在里面吗？" 真嗣困惑地问，"一个和我年纪相仿的飞行员…真好奇他是谁…

Asuka's face reappeared on another orange screen.  
明日香的面容又一次映现在另一块橙色显示屏上。

"Shinji-kun… the pilot is – AAAAAAAAH" the screen went blank.  
"真嗣君…驾驶员是 – AAAAAAAAH" 屏幕突然一片漆黑。

"ASUKA!" yelled Shinji "ASUKA!" 碇真嗣大声喊道

"Eva-02 is down. Plug has been ejected. Sending retrievers."  
Eva-02 已宕机，插头被弹出。正在派遣回收器。

The berserk Eva had been overpowered and disemboweled by Eva-01, using the Dummy Plug. Shinji was furious at his father for using his hands to destroy the Eva. The entry plug was crushed by 01's fist, and the pilot was being rescued. Shinji could only pray that he or she was alive.  
被 Dummy Plug 控制的 Eva-01 制服并剖开了狂暴的 Eva。真嗣对父亲利用自己的双手摧毁 Eva 感到怒不可遏。插入栓被 01 的拳头压扁，救援人员正在抢救驾驶员。真嗣唯有祈祷那位驾驶员尚存一息。

Misato's voice filled the entry plug. She sounded frail and weary. Shinji was happy to hear her alive.  
美里的声音在插入栓内回响，显得虚弱而疲惫。真嗣听到她的声音，知道她还活着，心中感到欣慰。

"Shinji-kun… I'm sorry… I should've told you earlier… I'm really sorry…"  
真嗣，对不起，我早该告诉你的，真的很对不起。

"Tell me what Misato-san?"  
三乡女士，您想告诉我什么？

"I'm really sorry… I should've told you… the pilot of Eva-05 is…"  
真的很抱歉…我早该告诉你的…Eva-05 的驾驶员是…

Shinji let out a bloodcurdling scream as Toji Suzuhara's limp body was carried out of the ruined entry plug.  
真嗣发出一声撕心裂肺的尖叫，只见东治·铃原的身体无力地被抬出了破损的插入栓。

Shinji had been forced out of the entry plug and brought to the Nerv hospital, where he slept in a bed beside Toji's. Toji had been badly injured, and was in a state of coma. The doctors couldn't say if he would ever regain consciousness, neither could they confirm that he wouldn't be paralyzed from the waist down. Either way, the chances were low. Shinji was moved to an isolated ward without being woken up. There he slept a dreamless sleep, not stirring an inch for three days.  
真嗣被迫从插入栓中撤出，送往 NERV 医院，与东治的病床相邻。东治伤势严重，陷入昏迷。医生无法确定他能否苏醒，也无法保证他不会下半身瘫痪。无论哪种情况，希望都渺茫。真嗣在未被唤醒的情况下被转移到隔离病房，连续三天沉睡，无梦且静止不动。

Shinji woke up to a familiar ceiling. It was the same ceiling he'd seen after waking up from his first battle with an Angel. It took him a while to recall what had happened. Disgusted with the memories, he turned to his side. Asuka was curled up beside him, fast asleep. She looked pale and cold, and Shinji felt a tinge of guilt. Slowly, he slid his blanket over her, and she stirred closer to him. A tear glistened in her eye before falling onto the bed sheets and disappearing. Shinji hugged her gently, and she woke.  
真嗣醒来，眼前是那熟悉的屋顶。这正是他在与使徒初次交战后醒来时所见的屋顶。他费了些时间才回想起一切。对这些记忆感到厌恶，他侧过身去。明日香蜷缩在他身旁，正熟睡中。她面色苍白，显得有些冷，真嗣心中涌起一丝愧疚。他轻手轻脚地将自己的毯子盖在她身上，她便向他这边挪了挪。一滴泪在她眼角闪烁，随即滴落在床单上，消失无踪。真嗣轻柔地拥抱着她，她缓缓睁开了眼睛。

"Shinji…" she whispered, another tear forming in her eye.  
"真嗣……" 她轻声呢喃，眼角再次涌出泪花。

"I'm okay, Asuka-chan" he said with a thin smile, wiping her tear with his finger.  
"我没事，飞鸟。" 他微笑着，用手指轻柔地拭去她的泪珠。

"I'm so sorry… I should have told you…"  
真的很抱歉…我早该告诉你的…

"Forget about it." Shinji breathed. "How's Toji?"  
别提了。" 真嗣喘息着说，"东治怎么样了？

Asuka explained about the possibilities of Toji's recovery. Shinji faced the ceiling and closed his eyes. It was his turn to stem the tears. Asuka held him close, attempting to comfort him. All he could do was hold her in return. He prayed hard that Toji would recover. He silently swore at his father. His mind was beginning to haze again, so he slept, with his darling Asuka beside him, whispering loving words into his ear, as their hearts beat in perfect unison.  
明日香阐述了东治恢复的可能性。真嗣仰望天花板，闭目忍泪。明日香紧拥着他，试图给予慰藉。他只能以拥抱回应。他内心深处祈祷东治能康复，同时默默地责怪着自己的父亲。思绪再次变得朦胧，他便沉沉睡去，身旁是挚爱的明日香，轻声细语地倾诉爱意，两颗心同步跳动，和谐无间。

Shinji woke up again, the spot where Asuka had lay in now cold and vacant. He wondered where she was, missing her more than ever. The room door slid open, and Shinji turned, expecting to see Asuka. Instead, two men in black suits that Shinji didn't recognize entered. They ordered him to dress and handcuffed him before bringing him to his father's office.  
真嗣又一次醒来，明日香曾躺过的位置如今已冰冷无人。他心中疑惑，她究竟去了哪里，此刻对她的思念愈发强烈。房门无声开启，他满心期待地回头，却见两名陌生黑衣男子步入。他们命令他更衣，并给他铐上手铐，随后将他带往父亲的办公室。

Gendo Ikari sat in his chair behind he desk, his hands joined in front of him. Shinji stood about ten feet way, his arms locked by the handcuffs in front of him. He was giving his father the most insolent stare he could muster. The Commander questioned Shinji, and Shinji replied that he would not pilot the Eva anymore. Commander Ikari then proceeded to accuse Shinji of running away, again. Shinji yelled that he would not be a toy for his father to manipulate. He left the room fuming. He was going to leave Nerv. He was going to leave Tokyo-3. He was going to leave the Evangelions, the Angels and his father. Nothing would stop him. Nothing at all. Not even his beloved Asuka.  
源渡坐在办公桌后的椅子上，双手合十置于身前。真嗣站在约十英尺外，双手被手铐束缚在身前，正竭力向父亲投去挑衅的目光。指挥官质问真嗣，真嗣坚决表示不再驾驶 Eva。源渡随即指责真嗣又一次逃避。真嗣怒吼，他不愿成为父亲手中的傀儡。他愤然离开房间，决意离开 NERV，离开第三新东京市，离开 Eva、使徒和父亲。任何事物都无法阻挡他，绝无可能。即便是他深爱的明日香也无法挽留。

### Chapter 4: I Need No Sympathy
Shinji fell backwards out into the corridor of Misato's apartment. Asuka had launched herself at him the moment he entered, and was now on top of him, sharing a heated kiss. Shinji smiled a grateful smile when she finally released him. They entered the apartment together, Asuka extremely happy at the return of Shinji, who was gloomy. They sat down opposite each other, Asuka handing him a cup of warm tea she had made earlier.  
真嗣跌跌撞撞地退到美里公寓的走廊上。他刚进门，明日香便扑了上去，此刻正压在他身上，两人热情地拥吻。当她终于松开时，真嗣报以感激的微笑。他们一同走进公寓，明日香对真嗣的归来喜形于色，而真嗣则面带忧郁。两人相对而坐，明日香递给他一杯之前准备的热茶。

Shinji didn't know what to tell her, but she wasn't persistent. He finally gave her a synopsis of what happened in his father's office. Asuka was silent for a while.  
真嗣不知该如何向她说明，而她也没有一再追问。最终，他向她简述了在父亲办公室里发生的事。明日香沉默了片刻。

"So you're leaving?" she asked finally.  
"那么，你是要走了吗？"她最终开口问道。

"Yes… I have to… I cannot stand this place…" Shinji replied, holding back his anger through clenched teeth. "I hate this place… I _hate_ this place so much!"  
是的…我必须离开…我实在受不了这里…" 真嗣回答，紧咬着牙关压抑着怒气。"我讨厌这里…我太讨厌这里了！

Asuka bit her lower lip. She longed to question Shinji about where their relationship would lie after he leaves, but she couldn't bear to hear the answer. Not now.  
明日香轻咬着下唇，心中渴望向真嗣探询，他离开后两人的关系将如何定位，然而她害怕听到答案，此刻她做不到。

They sat silently for a few minutes, Shinji trying hard to regain his composure. Finally he spoke, answering her unasked question.  
他们沉默地坐了几分钟，真嗣竭力平复情绪。最后，他打破了沉默，回答了她心中未言明的问题。

"I don't wanna lose you, Asuka-chan." He said, staring at the soggy dregs in his cup, but not really looking. "Come with me… follow me… we'll start a new life together."  
我不想失去你，明日香。" 他凝视着杯中湿漉漉的残渣，目光却游离不定。"跟我走吧…追随我…我们一起开启新生活。

Asuka bit harder into her lip. She was torn between the two things that meant the most to her in her life, and her mind was confused. She had to decide…  
明日香用力咬紧嘴唇，生命中最重要的两件事让她陷入两难，思绪纷乱。她必须做出抉择……

Shinji got up and entered his and Asuka's room, piling his belongings into a large briefcase. Asuka could only stare at her cup of tea the whole time. The pressure was too much. She loved Shinji, but piloting the Evangelion was her life. It was her reason for existence. But so was Shinji. These thoughts wrestled with each other within her mind.  
真嗣站起来，走进他和明日香的房间，把东西塞进一个大公文包。明日香全程只能盯着她的那杯茶。压力实在太大。她爱着真嗣，但驾驶 EVA 是她的生命，是她存在的意义。然而，真嗣也是她生命的一部分。这些思绪在她心中激烈交战。

Asuka dissolved into tears.  
明日香泪如雨下。

Shinji dropped his bag outside their room door, and knelt beside Asuka, hugging her from behind. Warm tears streamed down her face and dripped off her chin onto his arms. They hugged like that for a long time. Asuka finally stopped crying and was silent, hugging his arms in front of her. She looked over her shoulder to Shinji, and shook her head. She was going to stay. She could not leave.  
真嗣把书包放在门外，跪在明日香身边，从背后紧紧拥抱着她。温暖的泪水从她的脸颊滑落，滴在他的手臂上。他们就这样相拥良久。明日香终于止住了哭泣，静静地抱着他的手臂。她转头望向真嗣，摇了摇头。她决定留下，无法离开。

Shinji got up and picked up his briefcase. He silently walked towards the front door of the Katsuragi residence. Asuka followed him, but stopped at the corridor leading to the exit. Shinji turned around.  
真嗣起身拿起公文包，默默地朝葛城家的前门走去。明日香跟在他身后，却在通往出口的走廊处止步。真嗣回过头来。

"I love you, Asuka-chan…"  
我爱你，飞鸟酱……

He left. 他走了。

Now alone in the apartment, Asuka leaned forward into the wall, tears streaming down her face. Things were terrible. Her sync ratios were dropping dramatically since Shinji's hospitalization. Her awful period cramps were not improving the situation. And Shinji left. Shinji left. Baka-Shinji left her. She was all alone now. All alone.  
如今，公寓里只剩明日香一人，她倚靠在墙上，泪水如断线珠子般滑落。一切都不顺心。自从真嗣住院后，她的同步率直线下降。加之剧烈的经期疼痛，情况愈发糟糕。而真嗣，那个笨蛋真嗣，竟然离她而去。此刻，她孤零零的，独自面对这一切。

"Baka…. Baka… BAKA!" 傻瓜…. 傻瓜… 傻瓜！

She sank to her knees and broke down crying again. She cried as the white hot pain in her stomach grew. She cried through the pain for a long time, before finally passing out on the hard, cold, wooden floor.  
她跪倒在地，再次泣不成声。腹中那股灼热的疼痛愈发剧烈，她痛哭流涕。在长时间的痛苦折磨后，她终于在冰冷坚硬的木地板上昏迷过去。

Shinji stood in front of the tracks, waiting for his train. Misato had dropped him off, but not before giving him some well-chosen words.  
真嗣站在铁轨前，等待着自己的列车。美里送他至此，临行前不忘叮嘱几句。

The train arrived and stopped. A female voice announced something that Shinji was not paying attention to. He mechanically boarded the empty train.  
列车到站停稳后，一位女士的声音广播着什么，但真嗣并未留心。他机械地踏上了空荡荡的车厢。

The doors closed behind him, and the plastic handles hanging from the bars on the roof begin to sway. The train left the station and began to gain speed, heading towards the outside world.  
他身后的门关上了，车顶栏杆上挂着的塑料把手随之摇晃起来。火车缓缓驶出站台，逐渐加速，向着广阔的外界驶去。

### Chapter 5: Because I Am
The train moved further and further away from the station. Shinji watched as the final glimpse of the station disappeared from sight. He questioned himself again why he was doing this. Was it pride? Was it cowardice? No, Shinji reasoned, he just wanted a simpler life. He never wanted to be a pilot. He didn't do it by choice. Flashbacks of himself sitting on the earth behind his school, rubbing a bruise delivered by Toji, played in his mind.  
火车渐行渐远，车站的最后景象也消失在视野中。真嗣再次自问，为何要走上这条路。是骄傲驱使？还是懦弱作祟？不，真嗣思索着，他只是渴望一种更简单的生活。成为飞行员并非他的初衷，这并非他自主的选择。脑海中浮现出他在学校后院，抚摸着被东治打伤的淤青的画面。

"I didn't pilot it by choice…" he repeated after his mental image of himself. The train rattled as it neared the edge of Tokyo-3. He was running away. He knew it, but he could not admit it. In a fit of self loathing, Shinji put on his SDAT and pressed the play button, attempting to drown out his thoughts with his favorite songs. Shinji stared at the roof from his bench as the voice of a female vocalist vibrated his eardrums.  
"我不是出于选择才驾驶它的……"他脑海中的自我形象再次重复道。列车嘎吱作响，正驶向东京-3 的边缘。他在逃离。他心知肚明，却难以直面。在一阵自我厌恶中，真嗣戴上 SDAT，按下播放键，试图用他钟爱的歌曲来淹没内心的纷扰。他躺在长椅上，凝视着车顶，女歌手的声音在耳边回响。

The train stopped. 列车停下了。

Shinji stopped the tape. He was nowhere near a station. The train had stopped in its tracks, and was completely still, with the exception of the swaying handles above Shinji. Shinji got up as the automated doors opened.  
真嗣按下了磁带的暂停键。他所在的位置离车站还很远。火车已经停驶，完全静止不动，只有头顶的扶手还在微微摇晃。当自动门开启时，真嗣站起身来。

"What's going on?" he asked aloud to nobody.  
"怎么了？" 他大声地问道，四周无人。

As if answering his question, the carriage's lone speaker announced that an emergency had been declared, and that he should exit the train and proceed to the nearest shelter. Shinji cringed. An angel attack. He stared at the general direction of Nerv headquarters, and wondered about Asuka.  
似乎在回应他的疑问，车厢中唯一的广播突然宣布了紧急状态，要求他立即离开列车，前往最近的避难所。真嗣心头一紧，意识到是使徒来袭。他望向 NERV 总部的方向，不禁担忧起明日香的情况。

He got off the train.  
他下了火车。

Asuka picked up the assault rifle sent up by Misato. The angel was an ugly one, not unlike a deformed doll. It's arms were folded like long ribbons at its side. Its feel were mere stumps of its body, and it's face resembled a white, clay mask. Asuka was concentrating on increasing her sync with all her might. She could not lose now. She was the only available option of attack, with Eva-00's arm missing and Shinji believed to be far from Tokyo-3 by now. She was the only option, yet one nagging portion of her mind was telling her it was hopeless. Without Shinji, nothing mattered. Yet she had made a choice. A stupid choice. Stupid. Stupid was what she was. Stupid. So bloody stupid. Asuka got hold of herself at the brink of bursting into tears. The angel was advancing, but Asuka was ready.  
明日香接过美里递来的突击步枪。眼前的使徒面目可憎，宛如一个畸形的玩偶。它的双臂如同长带般垂在两侧，腿部仅是身体的残端，面容酷似一张苍白的黏土面具。明日香正竭尽全力提升与机体的同步率。她绝不能败。在零号机失去手臂、真嗣远在第三新东京市之外的情况下，她是唯一的进攻选择。尽管内心有个声音在说这是徒劳，没有真嗣，一切都无意义，但她已做出选择——一个愚蠢的选择。她就是愚蠢，愚蠢至极。在泪水即将涌出的边缘，明日香稳住了自己。使徒步步紧逼，而明日香已做好迎战的准备。

Or so she thought. 她当时是这样认为的。

With a sudden lash of it's leathery, carpet-shaped arm, the Angel swiped of both of Eva-02's arms, before spinning it around and striking through what appeared to be her entry plug. The Evangelion fell silent, and the angel walked past it as if it was just another building. The red Evangelion fell backwards, the crushed entry plug flying out and rolling over the vacant fields like a beer-can.  
突然间，天使挥动其皮革般的地毯状手臂，猛地将 Eva-02 的双臂斩断，紧接着旋转身体，穿透了看似是其驾驶舱的部分。这台福音战士随即静默，而天使则若无其事地从旁经过，仿佛它只是一座寻常建筑。红色的福音战士向后倒下，驾驶舱残骸飞出，在空旷的田野上滚动，宛如一个被丢弃的啤酒罐。

Half a mile away, a breathless Shinji screamed out his lover's name after watching the Eva's ugly defeat.  
半英里之外，真嗣在目睹 Eva 的丑陋败北后，喘着粗气呼唤着爱人的名字。

Shinji reached the ruined entry plug as fast as he could. No retriever crew was in sight yet. Tearing off his shirt and wrapping his hands with it, he slowly twisted open the latch of the entry plug. Steam billowed into his face as he concentrated on releasing the entry hatch. The hatch opened and the steam cleared, revealing the limp body of Asuka Langley Sohryu, clad in her compressed, red plug suit, hunched over her controls. Her head was bleeding, and her red blood was mingling with the orange LCL. Shinji dragged her out as blaring sirens of the retriever crew filled the air.  
碇真嗣以最快的速度赶到了损毁的插入栓旁，四周尚未见到救援队的踪影。他迅速脱下衬衫，缠绕在手上，小心翼翼地拧开了插入栓的锁扣。随着他专注地打开舱门，一股蒸汽迎面扑来。舱门开启后，蒸汽逐渐散去，露出明日香·兰格雷瘫倒在控制台上的身躯，她身着紧绷的红色插入栓服，头部受伤流血，鲜红的血液与橙色的 LCL 交融。在救援队急促的警报声中，真嗣将她从插入栓中拖了出来。

After making sure that Asuka was in safe hands, Shinji ran back to headquarters, where he demanded that he be allowed to pilot Eva-01, which had rejected both Rei and the Dummy Plug. Shinji managed to lead the Angel out into the Geofront, where a gruesome battle ensued, ending with Eva-01 devouring the Angel, and Shinji lost within the entry plug at the Sync ratio of 400%. The Evangelion, by taking into itself the Angel, had thrown off the shackles that enabled NERV to control it. The Eva had been restrained and locked up, but Dr. Akagi and Misato were attempting to regain Shinji.  
确保明日香安然无恙后，真嗣急忙返回总部，坚决要求驾驶曾排斥零和 Dummy Plug 系统的 Eva-01。他成功将使徒诱至 Geofront，引发了一场血战，最终 Eva-01 吞噬了使徒，而真嗣在插入栓内的同步率飙升至 400%，意识陷入混沌。Eva 因吸收使徒之力，挣脱了 NERV 的控制枷锁。尽管 Eva 已被严密封锁，赤木博士和美里仍在努力寻回真嗣。

Inside the entry plug floated an empty plug suit.  
插入栓内悬浮着一件空无一物的驾驶服。

Shinji found himself floating in LCL. His mind was merged with everything around him, and it was impossible to see where his mind ended and where the physical entry plug it was contained it began. A slow, cruel rhapsody began to play around him, like an impossibly illustrated poem. Shinji sank himself into his thoughts.  
真嗣意识到自己正漂浮在 LCL 液体中，他的意识与周遭万物交融，难以界定他的意识与承载他的插入栓之间的界限。四周缓缓奏起了一曲残酷的狂想曲，仿佛一幅难以言喻的诗画。真嗣深陷于自己的思绪之中。

_Where am I?I see my suit… but where am I?  
我这是在哪里？我看到了我的西装……可我究竟身处何方？_

The orange LCL. 橙色 LCL。

_I'm inside the Eva. The Eva. What Am I?  
我正身处 Eva 之中。Eva，我究竟是什么？_

Shinji Ikari. 真嗣·碇。

_Asuka? Where's Asuka? 明日香呢？她在哪儿？_

Asuka Langley Sohryu 飞鸟真绫·兰格蕾

_I'm in the Eva. I'm one with it.  
我身处 Eva 之中，与之合而为一。_

Primordial Soup. 原始海洋

Yes, primordial soup This taste… this smell…blood…this is the entry plug…  
是的，原始汤。这味道……这气息……血腥味……这就是插入栓……

The Entry Plug. 插入栓（Entry Plug）

Who am I? 我究竟是谁？

Shinji Ikari, Third Children  
碇真嗣，第三位适格者

Father? 爸爸？

Gendo Ikari 源堂元渡

I HATE YOU! 我真的很讨厌你！

Gendo Ikari 源堂

I HATE YOU! YOU ABANDONED ME!  
我真的很恨你！你竟然抛弃了我！

_I HATE YOU! 我真的很讨厌你！_

Gendo Ikari 源堂元渡

STOP IT! I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU!  
别这样了！我不想再看到你！

_GET OUT OF MY MIND!  
别再烦扰我的思绪了！_

Asuka

Yes! Asuka! I want Asuka! Where's Asuka?  
对！明日香！我想要明日香！明日香在哪里？

Ruined entry plug, crushed.  
破损的入口插头，已压坏。

Asuka, lifeless and bleeding.  
明日香，奄奄一息，血流如注。

No… no… Asuka, critical condition, possibly dead… NO! THAT'S NOT TRUE!  
不…不…明日香，情况危急，可能已经…不！这绝不是真的！

How would you know? 你怎么知道呢？

You're in here 你在这儿

She's out there 她就在外面

SHE'S FINE! 她没事！

_SHE'S FINE! 她没事！_

_SHE'S FINE! 她没事！_

_SHE'S ALIVE AND WELL! 她安然无恙，状态良好！_

Do you really know that?  
你真的知道那件事吗？

Do you really want to find out?  
你真的想了解真相吗？

SHE'S FINE! 她没事！

Only one way for you to find out, Shinji…  
真嗣，你只有一种方法可以找出答案…

Mother? 妈妈？

Shinji found himself lying facedown on an LCL flooded floor. He was in a daze, not taking notice of anything. He felt groggy, as if just woken up. With a small, giddy pleasure, he fell into deep sleep, unaware of his guardian hugging him with all her might, completely and utterly in tears. He was brought to the Nerv hospital, where he slept and slept and slept.  
真嗣发现自己趴在满是 LCL 的地板上，意识模糊，对周围毫无察觉。他感觉头昏脑涨，像是刚从睡梦中醒来。带着一丝微妙的愉悦，他沉入了深深的梦乡，全然不知他的监护人正紧紧拥抱着他，泪如雨下。他被送到了 NERV 的医院，在那里他不断地沉睡。

Asuka lay in another bed five feet from his, dazily waking up…  
明日香躺在离他五英尺的另一张床上，迷迷糊糊地醒来……

-To be continued- - 未完待续 -

Author's note: Okay, I've planned the structure for my ending already. I don't know when it'll be finished. I have major exams coming so I'll probably dust this off until the middle of next month. Until then, ciao!  
作者附言：我已构思好结局的框架，但完成时间尚不确定。由于即将迎来重要考试，我可能要到下月中旬才能继续。在此之前，先告一段落！

Author's extra note: Its not that I want this fanfic to end. I really can't think of what to write. There's only a few more episodes until the actual series ends and I am writing along those lines. Maybe I'll rip of EoE with this story too but I really don't know. Maybe when I have time I'll further it to after the Third Impact.  
作者附注：并非我想要结束这篇同人文，而是真的不知道接下来该写什么。原作即将迎来尾声，我的创作也紧随其后。或许我会效仿《EoE》的风格，但目前还无法确定。将来若得空闲，我可能会续写至第三次冲击之后的故事。

不管怎样，阅读、点评，准备好你的巫毒娃娃，Darqy 又带着更多关于 Eva 的劲爆同人故事回归了！

Yatta! 成功了！

The loud chirping of cicadas could be heard from the inside. The warm rays of light shone through the windows as birds flew busily outside. A veil of mist surrounded the mountaintops. The lush, green forests at the foot of the hills climbed towards the peak, covering the mountains in green. The smell of rain and grass clung heavily in the air. The surrounding trees were moist with dew. All these sights and smells and sounds created this morning, just like any other morning. The person behind the window ran her fingers across the glass of the window separating her from the outside world. She longed to get out, but the windows and walls and doors kept her in. She was a prisoner in this corridor, able only to experience the morning within those walls.  
蝉鸣声从室内传来，温暖的光线透过窗户洒落，鸟儿在窗外忙碌飞翔。薄雾笼罩着山巅，山脚下的葱郁森林向山顶延伸，绿意盎然。空气中弥漫着雨后草地的气息，四周的树木挂着露珠。这一切景象、气味和声音构成了这个早晨，与往常无异。窗后的人用手指轻抚着隔绝她与外界的玻璃。她渴望走出，却被窗户、墙壁和门扉所困。在这条走廊里，她如同囚徒，只能在墙内感受清晨。

Her bandaged arm hung limply and uselessly on a sling across her breasts. Her eye-patch sent her vision into two dimensions. Yet she saw everything outside. The warmth of the sun, the dampness of the earth. The smell of the flowers, the sound of the insects and animals outside. She saw and felt and longed for them, yet she was confined within the brick walls.  
她那被绷带包裹的手臂无力地垂挂在胸前的吊带上，眼罩让她的视野变得平面。尽管如此，她仍能感知到外面的一切：阳光的温暖、土地的湿润、花朵的香气、以及外面昆虫和动物的声响。她看见了，感受到了，渴望着这一切，却被困在冰冷的砖墙之中。

Asuka begin pounding the glass with her fists.  
明日香用拳头猛烈敲打玻璃。

Let me out… 放我出去…

It was a while before she realized those words actually came out of her mouth. She stopped pounding and clenched her fist against the window pane. The window wouldn't break.  
片刻后，她才惊觉那些话竟是从自己嘴里说出的。她停下敲击，拳头紧抵着窗玻璃。玻璃坚不可摧。

Let me out, damn you!  
放我出去，真是的！

She begin to cry. The walls grew around her, closing in on her, suffocating her. Somehow she knew that she wanted release not from the building, but from her own mind. She was terrified and frightened, for she could not remember. She felt a smothering loss that she could not explain. She felt trapped in her own mind, wanting to finally regain what was most precious to her.  
她开始哭泣。周围的墙壁仿佛在向她逼近，将她紧紧包围，令她感到窒息。她隐约意识到，自己渴望的不是逃离这座建筑，而是从内心的束缚中解脱。她感到深深的恐惧和不安，因为她无法回忆起那些记忆。她被一种无法言说的失落感所笼罩，仿佛被困在自己的思绪之中，渴望找回那最为珍贵的东西。

Her memory. 她的记忆。

Dr. Akagi sat down firmly, resting a large file onto the cold, metal table. She unwound the string around the clasp of the file before opening it and scanning the first page of its contents. She flipped through the first few pages before examining a particular page. She read and reread the entire page until she was certain the information had been committed to memory. Satisfied with herself, she closed the file and looked across the table at the silent Asuka.  
阿基吉博士坚定地坐下，将一个大文件夹搁在冰冷的金属桌上。她解开文件夹扣上的绳子，打开后迅速浏览了第一页的内容。她翻阅了几页，然后专注地查看某一页。她反复阅读，直至确信已将信息牢记。满意地点点头，她合上文件夹，目光转向对面沉默的明日香。

Asuka stared at her hands, which were clasped tightly on her lap. Little, fuzzy images floated across her mind, the escaped memories that still lingered within her. She concentrated on one particularly blur image. The distortion began to clear up. She could see it was a person, clad in a school uniform over a blue shirt. He looked too familiar. Her head began to hurt. Her heart began to beat faster, yet she felt no joy at that picture. Only pain.  
明日香凝视着紧握在膝上的双手。脑海中飘过一些模糊的画面，那是残留在记忆中的逃逸片段。她专注于其中一个特别模糊的图像，扭曲逐渐清晰起来。她辨认出那是一个穿着校服、内搭蓝色衬衫的人，看起来异常熟悉。她的头开始作痛，心跳加速，然而面对那幅画面，她感受不到任何喜悦，唯有痛苦。

Who is this person? Why does my heart hurt when I remember him? I feel like crying… I can't explain it… who are you? Who…?  
这个人是谁呢？每当想起他，我的心就隐隐作痛，眼泪几乎要夺眶而出……我无法言说……你究竟是谁？到底是谁……？

"Asuka?" Akagi's voice snapped into her brain.  
"Asuka?" 赤木的声音猛地在她脑海中响起。

Asuka looked up instinctively. The name triggered a reaction that made her answer it. It was confusing. It took her a while to realize that it was _her_ name. She stared blankly at Akagi, who said nothing. They looked at each other for some time, and Asuka finally looked away, unable to take Akagi's penetrating stare. Her gaze reverted to her lap again, and she bit her lower lip, confused. And alone.  
明日香本能地抬起头。这个名字让她不由自主地回应，感到十分困惑。她愣了一会儿才意识到那是自己的名字。她茫然地看着赤木，对方沉默不语。两人对视良久，明日香最终无法承受赤木那锐利的目光，转开了视线。她再次低头看向自己的膝盖，咬着下唇，心中满是困惑与孤寂。

"Asuka?" Akagi repeated. "Do you know who I am?"  
Asuka?" 赤木又问了一遍，"你认识我吗？

She didn't. 她确实没有。

"My name is Dr. Akagi. You've known me for some time."  
我是赤木博士，你已经认识我一段时间了。

Asuka looked up at Dr. Akagi. She _did_ look familiar, yet she couldn't remember anything about the blond haired doctor. Her eyes were threatening to sprout tears again. It was painful, as if living in another dimension, where you mind was blank. Even your own body felt unfamiliar. Her head begin to throb. She wanted to remember. She wanted to resume whatever life she was leading before this. She wanted to be normal again. Yet, a tiny part of her didn't. And it was linked to that boy… that boy she could not remember.  
明日香抬头凝视着赤木博士，感觉对方似曾相识，却怎么也记不起这位金发医生的点滴。泪水再次在眼眶中打转，痛苦如同置身异次元，脑海空空如也，连自己的身体都显得陌生。头痛开始袭来，她渴望回忆，渴望回到之前的生活，渴望恢复如常。然而，心底某个角落却抗拒着，这抗拒与那个男孩有关——那个她无法忆起的男孩。

"…and it seems that you have lost most, if not all, of you memory." Akagi concluded. "Asuka, did you understand me?"  
……看来你已经失去了大部分记忆，甚至可能全部丧失。" 阿贺木总结道，"飞鸟，你听懂了吗？

Asuka nodded. Akagi leaned back and sighed with relief. At least she wasn't completely wiped. She reopened the file and scribbled something untidy on the first page. Pushing the file aside and recapping her pen, she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table, and her chin on her hands. She began to talk casually to Asuka, as if over coffee. Akagi smiled reassuringly at Asuka, who seemed more confused than ever.  
明日香点头示意。赤木靠回椅背，如释重负地叹了口气。还好，她并未完全耗尽精力。她再次打开文件，在首页草草记下几笔。将文件推至一旁，盖上笔帽，她身体前倾，手肘支在桌上，双手托腮。她开始与明日香闲聊，仿佛两人正共饮咖啡。赤木对明日香投以安慰的微笑，而明日香看起来比任何时候都要迷茫。

"Asuka, if you can reply, please do. I'm quite sure the impact to your head did not affect your ability to speak."  
Asuka，若你能回复，请务必回复。我确信头部受到的撞击并未影响你的言语能力。

She remained silent. She had nothing to say. She didn't know anything. She was lost, confused, and most of all, frightened of all around her.  
她沉默不语，无言以对。她对一切一无所知，感到迷茫和困惑，内心深处更是充满了对周围环境的恐惧。

"Come on…" Akagi said with a tiny tinge of impatience. "Do you remember your age?"  
喂，我说…" 赤木略显不耐烦地问道，"你还记得自己多大了吗？

"Fourteen" 14

Another instinctive reply. Her voice was, thankfully, familiar to her. It did not seem foreign, like everything else. Maybe she wasn't so lost after all. She just needed something to push the memories back into place. Bit by bit Akagi begin to question her. She could remember tiny, irrelevant things like her birthday or favorite food. But when it came to subject like 'Nerv' or 'Evangelion' she was as confused and before, and her head hurt more. After about an hour of interrogation, Asuka was given a quick physical check up. Akagi wrote everything down on the first page of the file. She escorted Asuka back to her room, where she left her, alone to wander in her thoughts. She ended up falling asleep, her mind suddenly exhausted by the day's activities. She slept restlessly, the boy once again intruding into her mind. She cried in her sleep.  
又是一个本能的回答。幸好，她的声音对她而言是熟悉的。它并不像周围的一切那样显得陌生。或许她并没有完全迷失。她只是需要一些东西来帮助记忆归位。赤木开始一点一点地向她提问。她能回忆起一些琐碎的事情，比如自己的生日或最爱的食物。但一提到“NERV”或“Evangelion”，她依旧一头雾水，头痛也加剧了。经过约一个小时的审问，明日香接受了简单的体检。赤木将所有情况记录在档案的首页。随后，她将明日香送回房间，让她独自面对自己的思绪。最终，明日香因一天的折腾而感到心力交瘁，沉沉睡去。 她睡得不安稳，脑海中再次浮现出那个男孩的身影。她在睡梦中流下了眼泪。

Gendo Ikari waited outside Akagi's office as she finished filing her last reports. She backed out of her office, he arms laden with books and papers. She passed the Commander, who began striding along her side. He did not offer to help. They walked side by side in silence up until the break room. Akagi released her burden onto a nearby table and proceeded to the vending machine. She was putting in the final coin when Commander Ikari spoke up.  
源渡在办公室外等候赤木整理完最后一批报告。她抱着一堆书和文件走出办公室，经过指挥官时，他开始与她并肩前行，却未提出帮忙。两人沉默地一同走向休息室。赤木将手中的东西放到一张桌子上，随后走向自动售货机。就在她投入最后一枚硬币时，源渡打破了沉默。

"What is the report on the second child?"  
关于第二个孩子的报告内容是什么？

Akagi collected her drink from the slot at the bottom of the machine. She opened the can, and took a long, welcomed drought. She stared ahead into the rows of display cans arranged behind a transparent plastic screen ahead of her. She took another sip before replying.

"She's suffering from something called 'Selective Amnesia'."  
她患上了所谓的'选择性失忆症'。

"Elaborate." 请详细说明。

"Her mind wanted to forget something tremendous, something that impacted her, most probably hurt her very badly. That particular memory was most probably playing in her mind during the battle. Of course, one cannot just forget a traumatic experience. Thus, the impact to her skull must have enabled her mind to bend the rules a bit, and forced that particular memory, along with many others, into amnesia."  
她的内心渴望抹去一段沉重的记忆，这段记忆极可能曾深深伤害了她。在战斗中，那段记忆或许一直在她脑海中挥之不去。然而，创伤经历岂能轻易忘却？因此，头部所受的冲击可能让她的心智稍作妥协，将那段记忆连同其他许多记忆一并推入遗忘的深渊。

"In other words?" 你的意思是？

"She wanted to forget." 她渴望遗忘。

Neither said anything for a while. Akagi finished her drink and tossed the can into the trash can before collecting her stuff. As she was about to leave, Gendo left her with two simple words.  
两人沉默了一会儿。赤城喝完手中的饮料，随手将空罐丢入垃圾桶，随后整理好自己的物品。正当她要离开时，元渡用两句简短的话与她告别。

"Fix her." 修理她。

Notes: 注释：  
Selective Amnesia – A condition where the patient forgets a traumatic or bad experience, thought or memory on purpose. In most cases other critical memories that are relevant to the undesired memory is removed from the mind too. This form of amnesia is extremely rare, and usually occur after the patient suffers an impact to her head, spine of neck. Chances of a patient recovering the memory is very slim, due to the fact that the patient does not want to remember.  
选择性遗忘——指患者有意忘却创伤性或负面经历、念头或记忆的情况。多数情况下，与这些不愉快记忆相关的其他重要记忆也会一并从意识中抹去。此类失忆现象极为稀少，常在患者头部、脊椎或颈部遭受撞击后发生。由于患者内心抗拒回忆，恢复这些记忆的可能性微乎其微。

### Chapter 7: Little High, Little Low
Asuka sat in the narrow entry plug, her face void of any emotion. The cold trigger clasped in her hand still and unmoving, like her. Her eyes strained to the centre of the crosshair in front of her, willing the triangle to surround the circle. It finally did, and she squeezed the trigger gently, almost lovingly. The holographic prism in front of her Evangelion shattered under the heavy volley, 20 kilometers away. Asuka smiled. Training completed.  
明日香坐在狭窄的插入栓中，面无表情。她手中紧握的冰冷扳机静止如她。双眼紧盯前方十字准星的中心，努力使三角形包围圆圈。终于，三角形合拢，她温柔地，几乎是带着爱意地扣下扳机。前方二十公里处，她驾驶的福音战士前的全息棱镜在密集的炮火中碎裂。明日香微微一笑。训练结束。

She climbed out of the entry plug, cracking her knuckles and neck. This soothed her aching bones. She had spent 5 hours in that damned plug, trying to regain what little memory of her training was left. Dr. Akagi was pleased, as she had informed her well through the 3rd hour. Her combat skills were returning, and that was all that mattered to Commander Ikari. She had overheard him telling Misato that her amnesia was a good thing, as she could be trained into a 'perfect soldier', negated of emotion or feelings. Misato strongly opposed, but there was nothing she could do against her superior. Asuka didn't mind. She somehow felt that she didn't want to remember her past life, and this was an opportunity to live once more. She would be that 'perfect soldier'. Better than the two other pilots, the blue haired hermit and that boy. The feeling was familiar.  
她从插入栓中爬出，活动着手腕和脖，舒缓了疼痛的骨头。在那该死的插入栓里，她已耗费 5 小时，试图寻回残存的训练记忆。赤木博士对此颇为满意，早在第三小时便已告知。她的战斗技能正逐步恢复，这对碇司令而言至关重要。她偶然听到碇司令对美里说，她的失忆反而是好事，能被训练成一个“无情感的完美士兵”。美里虽强烈反对，却无力对抗上级。明日香对此并不介怀。她隐约觉得不愿回忆过去，这反而是重生的契机。她决心成为那个“完美的士兵”。 相较于另外两位飞行员，那位蓝发隐士和那个男孩，他更胜一筹。这种感觉似曾相识。

That boy… Shinji Ikari. 那个少年…碇真嗣。

He had tried to talk to her, against the orders issued by Commander Ikari. He had tried to explain to her something that involved them. He had found her in the hospital, as she was packing to leave for her new apartment on the east of the geo-front. He had talked fast, and all poor and confused Asuka could catch was 'sorry', 'love' and 'remember', before he was dragged away by security. Asuka could not understand why he was such a threat to her, and why he was barred from any contact with her except on the battle field. She could not understand, and she didn't want to. She now resembled a puppet, not unlike Rei Ayanami. They were both dolls in Commander Ikari's toy-box now. She hardly spoke, unless spoken to. She ate in silence, in her apartment, alone. She stopped going to school, instead spending every day in sync training and alert practice. She was a walking, talking mechanical being, receiving orders and following them without question. Only one thing separated her from the first child, Rei Ayanami – her determination to be the best.  
他曾违抗碇司令的命令，试图与她交谈。他想向她解释一些与他们相关的事情。他在医院找到她时，她正准备搬往地底都市东侧的新公寓。他急促地说着，可怜又困惑的明日香只听清了“对不起”、“爱”和“记住”，随后他就被保安带走了。明日香不解为何他对自己构成威胁，为何除了战场，他不得与她接触。她不愿深究。如今，她变得像绫波丽一样的傀儡，成为碇司令操控的玩偶。除非被问及，她几乎不发一言。她独自在公寓中默默用餐。 她不再去学校，而是每天投入同步训练和警觉练习。她如同一个能说会走的机械人，接到指令便无条件遵从。唯一让她与首位孩子绫波丽有所不同的是，她那成为最顶尖的坚定决心。

She walked past Dr. Akagi and Misato, not looking at them. She headed for the showers, where she stripped off her plug suit and stood under the welcomed cold shower. She closed her eyes and begin to think, as baths always made her do. Sometimes she thought too much.  
她从赤木博士和美里身边走过，未曾投去目光。径直走向淋浴间，褪去插入栓服，站在清凉的水流下。闭上双眼，思绪开始飘散，沐浴总是让她陷入沉思。有时，她会想得过于深沉。

Gendo Ikari sat behind his desk, scanning through a pile of papers. Every report was satisfactory. The 'perfect soldier' was doing well. His newfound plan was under way. Soon he would reach his ultimate goal in life, sooner than expected, after the sudden stroke of luck which was the Second Child's unfortunate accident. He smiled silently to himself, wallowing in his fortune. He shifted the papers to a corner of his desk. A photo fell out from within the file. Somehow he had missed it. It was a picture of Asuka with Shinji, in their school uniform, sharing a bowl of noodles together. It was the only picture of the two of them in an affectionate pose, as all others had been confiscated and destroyed. But this one was special. This one had to be kept in record. It was procedure. As it was a sensitive piece of evidence that could seriously damage Gendo's plans, he had ordered it to be kept in his private storage hall, where everything important or sensitive was kept. Only he had access to it, as it was hidden deep beneath the geo-front, in a room quite close to the remains of the first Evangelion. He returned the photo into the middle of the stack of papers, sealing the pile in a thick envelope. The door burst open.  
源渡坐在办公桌后，翻阅着一叠文件。每份报告都令人满意。那个“完美士兵”表现出色。他的新计划正在顺利进行。得益于第二适格者不幸事故带来的意外好运，他很快就能实现人生的终极目标，比预期的还要早。他默默地对自己微笑，沉浸在幸运之中。他将文件移到桌角，一张照片从文件夹中滑落。不知怎的，他之前竟未注意到。那是明日香和真嗣穿着校服，共享一碗面条的照片。这是两人唯一一张亲密姿态的照片，其他所有类似照片都已被没收并销毁。但这一张很特别。这一张必须记录在案。这是程序要求。 这份证据极为敏感，足以破坏源渡的计划，因此他下令将其存放在私人储藏室，那里专门存放重要或敏感物品。此地深藏于地下都市，紧邻初代福音战士的遗骸，仅他一人有权进入。他将照片放回文件堆中央，随后将整叠文件封入厚实的信封。就在此时，门突然被撞开了。

"I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!" The hollow chamber filled with the voice of a young boy, clad in a school uniform.  
"我实在受不了了！"空旷的房间中，一个身着校服的少年声音回响着。

The Commander looked up, unperturbed. It was his son, Shinji Ikari. It was his rebellious puppet, The Third Child.  
指挥官抬头看去，神色自若。眼前是他的儿子，碇真嗣，那个叛逆的第三适格者。

"What do you think you're trying to do to us?! I can't see her, I can't speak to her…" he continued, "Father, don't do this to me. Why do you hate me so much as to destroy every bit of happiness I have ever felt?!"  
你到底想对我们怎样？！我见不到她，也无法与她交谈…"他接着说，"爸爸，别这样对我。你为何如此憎恨我，非要毁掉我所有的快乐呢？

"My decision to separate you from the Second Child was not out of spite, Shinji." Gendo replied in his usual emotionless voice. There was no love, only ice. "It was for the sake of the Second Child. She is in a very sensitive state." Gendo began to wonder how he got to his office.  
"我决定让你与第二适格者分开，并非出于恶意，真嗣。" 源渡以他那惯常的冷漠语气回应。这里没有温情，只有冷酷。"这是为了第二适格者考虑。她目前状态非常敏感。" 源渡不禁思索起自己是如何抵达办公室的。

"But I have to speak to her… I have to see her… I have to let her know how sorry I am…" his voice trailed off. It was getting too personal.  
"但我必须与她交谈……我必须见她一面……我必须让她明白我有多么歉疚……" 他的声音逐渐减弱，话题变得过于私密。

"But you do see her." Commander Ikari replied simply.  
"但你确实看见了她。"指挥官伊卡里简洁地回应。

"From a distance… too far a distance…"  
从远处望去…距离太远了…

"And it will stay that way." his father replied pointedly, his eyes barring into Shinji's. He spoke with a tone that said, plainly, no more arguments.  
"情况就会这样维持下去。"他的父亲坚定地回应，目光锐利地盯着真嗣。他的语气清楚地表明，不再有讨论的余地。

Shinji turned around and faced the door.  
真嗣转身面向门。

"Then I must leave. I cannot take all this shit…" he begin to walk out.  
"我得走了，实在受不了这些破事……"他边说边往外走。

"If you leave, you will never see her again."  
一旦你离开，就再也见不到她了。

Shinji stopped for a moment, his right fist clenching and unclenching spasmodically. The room was silent, only the soft sounds of muscle constricting in Shinji's fist could be heard. He walked on. Gendo knew he had won.  
真嗣停下脚步，右拳不由自主地紧了又松。四周一片寂静，唯有他拳头中肌肉收缩的细微声响。他继续前行，源堂明白自己已经胜券在握。

Asuka stared ahead as the elevator doors opened to reveal Rei Ayanami, clad in her school uniform. She walked in, not giving a thought. They rose silently, as the meter clicked off each floor. Neither said a word for a long time.  
电梯门缓缓开启，明日香目光前视，只见绫波丽身着校服步入其中，神情自若。电梯无声上升，楼层数字逐一闪过。两人沉默良久，未发一言。

"You are an obstruction."  
你是个阻碍。

Asuka's eyes widened. The one called Rei was speaking to her, and her first sentence had been an insult. She felt a familiar anger rise in her throat.  
明日香瞪大了眼睛。那个叫绫波的人正对她说话，开口第一句就是侮辱。她感到一股熟悉的怒气涌上心头。

"I beg your pardon?" she replied, containing her anger.  
"不好意思，您能再说一遍吗？" 她尽力克制着怒气回答。

"You are an obstruction. Your progress to become the ultimate soldier of the commander's will become a hindrance to me." Rei replied calmly.  
"你是个障碍。你若成为指挥官意志下的终极战士，必将阻碍我。" Rei 平静地回应。

"A hindrance to you?" Asuka replied through clenched teeth. "Are you jealous or something?"  
这对你是个障碍吗？" 明日香紧咬着牙关反问道，"难道你在嫉妒什么？

"Jealousy is but a stranger to me. I'm merely stating that your sudden change in roles will void my very existence." Ayanami's voice was barely a whisper. "But I will make sure I am the commander's weapon in the end."  
嫉妒与我素无瓜葛。我仅是想说，你角色的突变将使我失去存在的意义。" 绫波的声音微弱至极。"但我定会让自己成为指挥官最终的利器。

Asuka took a step forward and grasped Ayanami's shoulder. Rei spun around from the force, only to receive a slap on her right cheek. She didn't flinch. A bell rung somewhere as the cold, metal doors of the elevator slid apart. Asuka walked out backwards, unable to shift her gaze from Rei. She was too angry to say anything. Rei held her bruise with one hand, staring at Asuka without emotion.  
明日香向前一步，紧抓绫波的肩膀。绫波受力转身，随即右脸颊挨了一巴掌。她并未退缩。此时，某处铃声响起，电梯的冰冷金属门缓缓开启。明日香倒退着走出电梯，目光始终无法从绫波身上移开。她怒火中烧，一言不发。绫波一手捂着脸上的淤青，面无表情地凝视着明日香。

"There is one fundamental difference between you and me, Second Child."  
你我之间有一个根本的区别，二娃。

Asuka stared. 明日香目不转睛地盯着。

"I can be replaced…" 我可能会被取代…

The doors closed. All Asuka could here was her own breathing. Her mind raced as she tried to understand what she had just been told. She stood staring at the elevator doors for a long time, her heart pounding madly. She did not notice the boy behind her, afraid to approach.  
门扉紧闭，明日香耳边只剩下自己的呼吸声。她的大脑飞速运转，试图消化刚刚听到的信息。她站在电梯门前，久久不动，心跳剧烈。她并未察觉身后那个男孩，他因害怕接近而踌躇不前。
