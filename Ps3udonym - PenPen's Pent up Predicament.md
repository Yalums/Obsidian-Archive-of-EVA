Asuka glared at me, red-faced and with her eye twitching, as she realized what had fallen in her lap. Misato just stood near the doorway with a bemused expression on her face. Pen-Pen let out a large panicked "WAARRK!" and waddled back to his fridge.  
明日香满脸通红，眼角抽搐地瞪着我，意识到有什么东西落在了她的大腿上。美里只是站在门口，脸上带着一丝玩味的表情。Pen-Pen 发出一声惊慌的“哇尔克！”，摇摇摆摆地回到了他的冰箱旁。

I blinked twice in genuine surprise, and took a look at the cover of the magazine.  
我惊讶地眨了两次眼，然后看了一眼杂志的封面。

PENGUINS GONE WILD! Underneath, subtitles were printed out, such as THESE NAUGHTY BIRDS WILL DO ANYTHING! and MISS AUGUST BARES ALL!  
《企鹅狂欢！》下方印着副标题，如《这些顽皮的鸟儿无所不为！》和《八月小姐全裸出镜！》

A female penguin stood proudly on the cover; flippers raised high, taking what appeared to be an attempt at a seductive pose (to penguins maybe).  
一只雌性企鹅骄傲地站在封面上；双翅高高举起，似乎在尝试一种诱人的姿势（对企鹅来说或许如此）。

"PERVERT SHIIINNNJJJIII!!"  
"变态真嗣！！！"

**Pen-Pen's Pent-up Predicament (Or, Shinji Discovers Craigslist)  
Pen-Pen 的困境（或，真嗣发现了 Craigslist）**

I hadn't bothered to stammer out that it wasn't mine – even though it had fallen out of my schoolbag when Asuka had knocked it off the table. It had probably gotten mixed up in my homework somehow... I didn't want to know how.  
我懒得辩解那不是我的——尽管它确实是在明日香撞掉我的书包时从里面掉出来的。它可能不知怎么混进了我的作业里……我不想知道是怎么回事。

Asuka sat at the table in an oversized t-shirt and shorts, glass of water in one hand, head resting on her other. Misato sat to her left, barely holding back giggles while hiding behind her fifth can of Yebisu. It fell on me to talk to Pen-Pen (whom we had coaxed out of the fridge) about his choice of reading material.  
明日香坐在桌前，穿着一件过大的 T 恤和短裤，一手拿着水杯，头靠在另一只手上。美里坐在她左边，强忍着笑意，躲在她第五罐惠比寿啤酒后面。我不得不和被我们从冰箱里哄出来的 Pen-Pen 讨论他的阅读材料选择。

"So…" I began. "那么…" 我开始说道。

"Wark?" Pen-Pen gawked at me with a quizzical look, magazine held by one of his retractable claws.  
"哇克？" 企鹅 Pen-Pen 带着疑惑的表情看着我，一只可伸缩的爪子抓着杂志。

"That's yours huh?" "那是你的吧？"

The penguin just nodded, looking down at his feet like a child receiving a stern lecture. A faint blush could be seen on his cheeks.  
那只企鹅只是点了点头，低头看着自己的脚，就像一个孩子在接受严厉的训诫。他的脸颊上隐约泛起了红晕。

"Just exactly how many magazines do you have in there?" I asked.  
“你那里到底有多少本杂志？”我问道。

Pen-pen continued to look down, not meeting my gaze. I guess he had quite the collection.  
Pen-pen 继续低头不语，没有与我对视。我想他收藏颇丰。

"Soooo…" I repeated, deliberately drawing it out. What was I supposed to say at a time like this?  
"所以……" 我重复道，故意拖长了音。这种时候我该说什么呢？

"It's not your fault," Misato chimed in, "we all have urges!"  
"这不是你的错，" 美里插话道，"我们都有欲望！"

"Yeah, you would know," Asuka sniped. She had been quite testy ever since Kaji and Misato rekindled their romance in a very open manner. For her part, our guardian gave her a scathing look, but said nothing.  
"是啊，你最清楚，" 明日香讽刺道。自从加持和美里以非常公开的方式重燃旧情后，她就一直很暴躁。作为我们的监护人，美里给了她一个严厉的眼神，但什么也没说。

I ignored the two, keeping the conversation on Pen-Pen. "So, you're just lonely?"  
我无视了那两人，继续谈论着 Pen-Pen。“所以，你只是孤单吗？”

He emitted a subdued warble in response, still looking down.  
他发出了一声低沉的颤音作为回应，依旧低着头。

"Maybe he just needs a romp in the sack," Misato suggested.  
“也许他只是需要一场欢快的嬉戏，”美里提议道。

My face turned a dark shade of red. Hairline fractures appeared on the glass of water in Asuka's hand as her grip tightened. Pen-pen was suspiciously still.  
我的脸变得通红。明日香手中的玻璃杯因握力加大而出现了细小的裂纹。Pen-pen 却异常安静。

"Just kidding!" Misato laughed at our expressions, "Don't worry, we'll find a girlfriend for you!" She raised her thumbs up, mouth curved upwards in one of her distinctively goofy grins.  
“开玩笑的啦！”美里看着我们的表情笑道，“别担心，我们会帮你找个女朋友的！”她竖起大拇指，嘴角上扬，露出了她那标志性的傻笑。

"WAAUGH!!" Pen-Pen looked up and clapped his flippers together with joy.  
“哇啊！！”Pen-Pen 抬头一看，兴奋地拍打着鳍状肢。

"Just one rule," Misato declared, face suddenly stern.  
"只有一条规矩，" 美里宣布道，脸色突然变得严肃。

"Wark?" "喵？"

"No sex in the house, alright? Or..." Her hand made a threatening snip-snip gesture for added effect. Both us males cringed and reached down instinctively for protection.  
"家里不准发生性行为，明白吗？否则..." 她用手做了一个威胁性的剪刀手势以增强效果。我们两个男性都不由自主地缩了缩身子，本能地去保护下体。

"How hypocritical of you; we heard the noises from your room last night," Asuka muttered.  
"你真虚伪；昨晚我们可都听到你房间的动静了，"明日香嘀咕道。

---

Now it was only the three of us at the kitchen table. Pen-Pen had retired to his fridge with the magazine… making us all shudder.  
现在厨房里只剩下我们三个人了。Pen-Pen 带着杂志回到了冰箱里……让我们都感到一阵寒意。

"So if Pen-Pen gets a girlfriend, will we keep her too?" I asked Misato.  
"那如果 Pen-Pen 有了女朋友，我们也要养她吗？"我问美里。

"I don't know," she said, words gurgled a bit as she emptied her sixth beer of the night. Even for her, downing six beers was a bit much. I guess the stress of being a parental figure to two adolescents and a sexually repressed penguin was getting to her.  
"我不知道，"她说道，声音因喝下当晚第六罐啤酒而有些咕噜。即便是她，一口气喝掉六罐啤酒也有些过量了。我想，作为两个青少年的家长和一个性压抑的企鹅的监护人，这份压力正逐渐压垮她。

"Haven't thought this through, have you?" Asuka smirked.  
"没考虑清楚吧，是不是？"明日香带着一丝讥笑说道。

"Shut up!" Misato snapped, popping the top on yet another can.  
"闭嘴！"美里厉声喝道，又开了一罐啤酒。

"Any ideas on how to get Pen-Pen a date?" I wondered out loud. The only members of the opposite sex I regularly talked to were part of NERV.  
"“有什么办法能让 Pen-Pen 找个约会对象吗？”我大声地自言自语。我平时接触的异性成员全都是 NERV 的。”

"Well, let's just hope he's not as bad with girls as you are," Asuka teased.  
"“好吧，希望他在女孩面前不会像你那么糟糕，”明日香打趣道。”

"I'm not bad with girls!" I started to defend myself, perhaps hopelessly.  
"“我可不擅长和女孩打交道！”我开始为自己辩解，或许是无望地。”

"Of course you are, idiot!" Asuka shouted. "The only time you even got CLOSE to a girl is when that slut Mana threw herself at you!"  
"你当然是个白痴！" 明日香喊道。"你唯一接近女生的时刻，就是那个荡妇麻奈主动贴上来的时候！"

"Mana was _not_ a slut!" Asuka had never liked the red-haired girl who was, however briefly, my girlfriend. Even when Mana turned out to be a Japanese spy in danger, Asuka had been so cavalier towards her.  
"麻奈才不是荡妇！" 明日香从未喜欢过那个红发女孩，尽管她只短暂地成为过我的女朋友。即便麻奈后来被揭露是身处险境的日本间谍，明日香对她也一直很冷漠。

"You're so stupid you wouldn't know if a girl liked you even if she came out and asked you for a kiss!"  
"你蠢到就算有女生直接向你索吻，你都察觉不到她是否喜欢你！"

"What kind of girl just comes out and asks a guy for a kiss in the first place?" I shot back. "No girl's _that_ desperate!"  
"哪有女孩子一上来就问男生要亲亲的？" 我反驳道。"没有哪个女孩会那么急切！"

"Hey, I resent that!" Asuka yelled.  
"嘿，我可不接受这种说法！" 明日香喊道。

Both of us quickly shut up as she said this, remembering our awkward kiss. I had forgotten how it had started. Asuka wouldn't meet my gaze – I guess I really had been that bad at kissing. Misato just stared blankly in a somewhat drunken haze, half-listening to us as we bickered – she had long since tuned us out. We both breathed a small sigh of relief, and Asuka shot me a dirty look.  
她这么一说，我们俩立刻闭嘴了，想起了那次尴尬的吻。我忘了那吻是怎么开始的。明日香不与我对视——我想我在接吻方面确实很糟糕。美里只是茫然地盯着，带着几分醉意，半听半不听地看着我们争吵——她早就对我们充耳不闻了。我们都松了一小口气，明日香瞪了我一眼。

"We could try the classifieds, maybe?" I suggested, filling up the awkward silence. I really didn't know where to begin to search for a female penguin.  
"我们或许可以试试分类广告？" 我提议道，试图打破尴尬的沉默。我真的不知道该从哪里开始寻找一只雌性企鹅。

"Are you an idiot? Penguins don't advertise on classifieds!" Asuka retorted, increasing incredulousness in her voice.  
"你是白痴吗？企鹅不会在分类广告上打广告的！" 明日香反驳道，语气中的难以置信愈发明显。

"That's it!" Misato broke from her reverie in a sudden.  
"就是它了！" 美里突然从沉思中惊醒。

"What's it?" Asuka and I spoke at the same time, evoking memories of our synch training.  
"这是什么？" 我和明日香同时开口，唤起了我们同步训练时的回忆。

"CRAIGSLIST!" Misato shouted triumphantly.  
"CRAIGSLIST!" 美里得意地大喊。

---

I nervously clicked on the "Tokyo-3" link at the main and Misato hovered on either side of me, leaning in close to take a look at the screen.  
我紧张地点开了主页上的“第三新东京”链接，美里在我两侧徘徊，凑近屏幕仔细查看。

"Let's browse through the personals," Misato suggested.  
"我们来看看征友启事吧，"美里提议道。

Most of the ads obviously weren't designed for penguins. For example, "Dependable, career-oriented, bespectacled NERV technician looking for his gorgeous raven-haired, well-endowed femme fatale" probably wouldn't have appreciated Pen-Pen replying to his ad. For that matter, I don't think "Brilliant blonde doctor searching for Casanova to cure her icy heart" would've either.  
大多数广告显然不是为企鹅设计的。比如，“可靠、事业有成、戴眼镜的 NERV 技术员寻找他那美丽乌发、身材火辣的蛇蝎美人”大概不会欣赏 Pen-Pen 回复他的广告。再者，我想“聪明金发的医生寻找情圣来治愈她冰冷的心”也不会对此感兴趣。

"You know what," Asuka suggested as she quickly scanned each headline. "While we're here, we might as well find you someone too, third child. Lord knows you could use the help."  
"你知道吗，"明日香一边迅速浏览每个标题一边提议道。"既然我们在这儿，不妨也给你找个伴，第三适格者。天知道你需要这方面的帮助。"

She shoved me aside before I could protest, eyes flashing dangerously as she zeroed in on a target. She found an ad and clicked on it, reading aloud.  
她在我抗议之前就把我推到一边，眼中闪烁着危险的光芒，锁定了一个目标。她找到一则广告并点击进去，大声读了出来。

"I am a Tokyo-3 adolescent male with an interest in giant robots and battleships. Interests also include artillery and cool bombers, not to mention tanks and fighters. Any military equipment, really. Also, I enjoy anime, video games, and camping trips. I'm looking for someone who shares my interests, and who can be the escorting frigate to my proud aircraft carrier. You send your picture, and I'll send mine."  
“我是一名东京-3 的青少年男性，对巨型机器人和战舰感兴趣。爱好还包括火炮和酷炫的轰炸机，更不用说坦克和战斗机了。任何军事装备都行。另外，我喜欢动漫、电子游戏和露营旅行。我在寻找一个与我兴趣相投的人，能成为我骄傲的航空母舰的护航驱逐舰。你发照片过来，我也会发我的。”

I glared at my fellow pilot. The redhead just burst out cackling and started rolling around on the floor. Misato grinned, a dangerous glint in her eyes.  
我瞪着我的同僚飞行员。红发女孩突然爆发出狂笑，开始在地上打滚。美里咧嘴一笑，眼中闪过一丝危险的亮光。

"You know, you might be onto something there, Asuka."  
"你知道吗，明日香，你这话可能还真有点道理。"

Asuka and I looked at her like she had grown an extra arm on her forehead.  
我和明日香看着她，仿佛她额头上长出了第三只手。

"We should send Shinji on a date, too. It'd be good for your confidence!" She beamed. "And you really should start dating again. You were so happy the last time!"  
"我们也该让真嗣去约会，这对你的自信有好处！"" 她笑得灿烂。""而且你真的应该重新开始约会了。上次你那么开心！"

I opened my mouth to protest, but Misato interrupted me before I could get a word out.  
我张嘴想要抗议，但 Misato 在我能说出一个字之前就打断了我。

"No arguments about this. That's a direct order, as your operations manager. Your happiness is essential to the Evangelion project," Misato pointed at me and gave me a very stern look, albeit with her lips somewhat curving upwards in a faint smile.  
“对此没有争论的余地。这是作为你的作战部经理的直接命令。你的幸福对 EVA 项目至关重要，”Misato 指着我，给了我一个非常严肃的表情，尽管她的嘴角微微上扬，带着一丝淡淡的微笑。

"Alright, fine," I acquiesced. There wasn't much I could do if it was an official order.  
“好吧，好吧，”我顺从了。如果是正式命令，我也没什么能做的。

Asuka now looked at both of us as if we had grown extra arms on our foreheads.  
明日香现在看着我们俩，仿佛我们额头上长出了额外的手臂。

---
And that's how come six o'clock Thursday night, Pen-Pen and I were to be dressed and ready to go for our respective dates. Misato had obviously been planning this out for a while now. She immediately called one of her old college friends and set me up with her niece, who had apparently been dying to meet the famous pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. Pen-Pen found himself a date too. Or rather, a series of dates, the first of which was at the local zoo – they had been looking for a mate for one of their cold water penguins. Strangely enough, they would be going to a bar. I imagined it had been Misato's suggestion.  
就这样，周四晚上六点，我和 Pen-Pen 都得打扮妥当，准备各自赴约。美里显然已经策划这件事好一阵子了。她立刻打电话给她的一位大学老友，安排我和她的侄女见面，据说这位侄女一直渴望见到著名的 EVA 初号机驾驶员。Pen-Pen 也找到了自己的约会对象，或者说是一连串的约会，第一个地点是当地的动物园——他们正在为其中一只冷水企鹅寻找伴侣。奇怪的是，他们最后会去酒吧。我想这大概是美里的主意。

According to Misato, my date was a nice girl my age by the name of Nami who lived on the other side of Tokyo-3. Nami's picture was of a fairly cute, if somewhat plain black-haired teen with medium-length hair to just below her shoulders. She was leaning against a railing in the photo, sunset in the background. All in all, she seemed like a fairly normal person, fascination with giant robots aside. I was wary of someone who liked me for my pilot status, but between her and Misato's alternative of combing through Craigslist again, I chose what I assumed was the safer option.  
据美里说，我的约会对象是个名叫奈美的好女孩，和我同龄，住在第三新东京市的另一边。奈美的照片上是一个相当可爱，虽然略显朴素的黑色中长发少女，头发长度刚好垂至肩下。她靠在栏杆上，背景是夕阳。总的来说，她看起来相当普通，除了对巨型机器人的痴迷之外。我对于因为我的驾驶员身份而喜欢我的人持谨慎态度，但在她和美里再次浏览 Craigslist 之间，我选择了我认为更安全的选择。

Of course, Asuka had happened to let it slip (in an extremely loud voice) during school that "the idiot would be a date tonight", so Toji and Kensuke spent the better part of the day "preparing" me. At least, that's what they called it. I called it sheer torture.  
当然，明日香在学校里无意中（用非常大的声音）透露了“那个白痴今晚要去约会”，所以唐治和真希波花了大半天时间“准备”我。至少，他们这么称呼它。我称之为纯粹的折磨。

Our sensei had gone home with a fever, so we were given instructions to study quietly in the classroom. It was a testament to the fact we had Hikari Horaki for a class rep that all of us stayed for the afternoon. Even so, there was only so much she could do to keep us in line – the room buzzed with conversation, textbooks forgotten on desks and in bags. Occasionally, gunshots and exaggerated announcer voices rang out from the computers, as an impromptu gaming session broke out.  
我们的老师因发烧回家了，所以我们被要求在教室里安静自习。这充分证明了我们有班长洞木光，全班同学都留到了下午。即便如此，她能维持秩序的手段也有限——教室里嗡嗡作响，课本被遗忘在桌子和书包里。偶尔，电脑里传出枪声和夸张的播音员声音，一场即兴的游戏环节就此展开。

"A date?" Toji practically announced to the class (if they hadn't heard Asuka before, they knew now), excitedly giving me on giant thump on my back as he looked at the picture of Nami. "You dog! First Mana, now this girl? Finally cashing in on your status as a pilot?"  
"约会？" 冬二几乎是对全班宣布（如果他们之前没听到明日香的话，现在也知道了），兴奋地在我背上猛拍一掌，看着娜美的照片。"你这家伙！先是玛娜，现在又是这个女孩？终于利用起你作为驾驶员的身份了？"

Kensuke was flashing me a thumbs up sign with a wide smile, camcorder recording. "So what you've got planned for your big romantic date?"  
剑介对我竖起大拇指，笑容满面，摄像机正在录制。"你为这次浪漫的约会准备了什么计划？"

"Errr… I think we're going to a dinner and a movie." I tried not to look directly at the red light and the lens of the camera, and started to look around the class. A group of girls in the corner immediately turned their heads away from our direction and started giggling, earning a frown from me.  
“呃…我想我们是去吃晚饭和看电影。”我尽量不直视红灯和摄像头的镜头，开始环顾教室。角落里的一群女生立刻把头转向别处，开始窃笑，这让我皱起了眉头。

Toji, being Toji, took the conversation to a more perverted train of thought. "Man, she's pretty cute. You've got to at least get to first base – maybe she'll even let you get to second tonight!"  
冬二，一如既往地，把话题引向了更下流的思路。“伙计，她挺可爱的。你至少得进一垒——也许她今晚甚至会让你上二垒！”

I nodded absent-mindedly. The class rep and Asuka were sitting just a few desks away from us, chatting. Asuka saw me and shot me a dirty look. My gaze quickly shifted to Rei, looking out the window at her desk. Today was one of her rare appearances in our classroom.  
我心不在焉地点了点头。班长和明日香就坐在我们几张桌子之外，聊着天。明日香看到我，狠狠地瞪了我一眼。我的目光迅速转向坐在窗边的绫波，她今天难得出现在我们的教室里。

"Seriously!" Toji went down on his knees in dramatic fashion. "If one of us gets the opportunity, we go for it! That's the guy code." Kensuke joined him on the floor, their faces both in suddenly solemn expressions, heads bowed, arms clasped together in reverence to the all-encompassing guy code.  
"“说真的！” 冬二戏剧性地跪了下来。“如果有机会，我们就得抓住！这是男人的准则。” 真嗣也加入了他的行列，两人脸上突然都露出了严肃的表情，低头鞠躬，双手紧握在一起，以示对无所不包的男人准则的敬意。”

Unfortunately, this gesture had two immediate consequences: first, Asuka decided to storm out of the classroom, audibly cursing in German under her breath, probably about what perverted idiots we were. Second, Hikari, who apparently had been listening to our conversation (like always), grabbed Toji by the ear and dragged him off to reprimand him.  
"不幸的是，这一举动立即带来了两个后果：首先，明日香决定冲出教室，嘴里低声用德语咒骂着，大概是在骂我们这些变态白痴。其次，光似乎一直在听我们的对话（一如既往），她抓住了冬二的耳朵，把他拖走训斥去了。”

At the end of her tirade, Hikari made sure to glare at me too, like I was the one who had made Asuka angry enough to run out.  
"在她的一番训斥结束后，光还不忘瞪了我一眼，好像是我把明日香气得跑出去的。”

---

Misato had decided to dress me for the occasion, even going out of her way to take me shopping – she was looking forward to the actual date more than I was. Pen-pen had even put on a bow tie for the occasion, and the feathers on top of his hair looked… slicked back with gel? I hadn't bothered with any sort of product on mine. I guess I was the only one treating date night lightly.  
美里决定为这个场合打扮我，甚至特意带我去购物——她对实际的约会比我还要期待。就连 Pen-pen 也为这个场合系上了领结，头顶的羽毛看起来……像是用发胶向后梳过？我可没费心用任何产品打理自己的头发。看来我是唯一一个把约会之夜看得轻松的人。

As if to underscore how important everyone thought the night was, Toji, Kensuke, and surprisingly, Hikari had come to see us off. Asuka was still nowhere to be found, much to the class rep's dismay. Misato had laughed off her disappearance. Asuka would never run away from Evangelion like I had; the redhead would be back after she let loose some steam. There was no need for Misato to be overly concerned, especially with NERV Intelligence keeping tabs on us.  
仿佛是为了强调大家认为这个夜晚有多重要，真治、健介，还有出人意料的，光也来为我们送行。明日香仍然不见踪影，这让班长非常沮丧。美里对她的失踪一笑置之。明日香绝不会像我那样逃避 EVA；她发泄完情绪后就会回来。美里无需过分担心，尤其是 NERV 情报部门一直在关注我们。

Toji and Kensuke were their familiar selves, alternating between drooling over and complimenting Misato while giving me some last minute "pointers". Hikari spent the entire time frowning at the two, although I definitely caught her giving me a few weird looks when she thought I wasn't looking. Misato laughed the visitors off too, before snapping a picture of me and Pen-Pen – Kensuke took care of the video.  
真治和健司还是老样子，一边对着美里流口水一边夸赞她，还不忘给我临行前的“指点”。光子全程皱着眉头盯着他俩，不过我确实瞥见她趁我不注意时朝我投来几个奇怪的眼神。美里笑着送走了访客，随后拍了一张我和 Pen-Pen 的照片——健司负责录像。

Misato slipped me a bunch of 1000 and 2000 yen bills after she showed us the photo on her digital camera, because "chivalry shouldn't be dead," she winked. I suppose she took it out of the Pilots Allowance she got from NERV. Even if Misato was terrible at her own personal finances, she was pretty good at managing money for me and Asuka.  
美里在给我们看了数码相机里的照片后，悄悄塞给我一堆 1000 和 2000 日元的钞票，眨眼说：“骑士精神不该消亡。”我想她是从 NERV 给驾驶员的津贴里拿出来的。尽管美里自己的财务管理一塌糊涂，但她对我们和明日香的资金管理倒是挺有一套。

And finally, the cab we had called for appeared downstairs, and Pen-Pen, Misato (chaperoning the penguins), and I were off to see what the night had in store.  
最后，我们叫的出租车到了楼下，Pen-Pen、美里（负责看管企鹅们）和我一起出发，去探索夜晚的精彩。

---

The cab ride was uneventful. The driver gave Pen-Pen a double take when we got in, but traffic was light and he dropped me off right in front of the theatre.  
出租车行程平淡无奇。司机在我们上车时对 Pen-Pen 多看了两眼，但交通顺畅，他直接把我送到了剧院门口。

"It's a school night - don't be home too late!" Misato gave me a thumbs-up as they sped off to their date. Nami was nowhere in sight.  
“今晚是学校夜，别太晚回家！”Misato 给我竖了个大拇指，他们便急匆匆赶去约会了。Nami 的身影无处可寻。

Even though I had been on dates before (well, okay, just one date with Mana), even I knew that blind dates were awkward. Waiting for one when you're the first one there? Well, that's probably one of the awkwardly awkward moments ever in the history of awkwardness. I was losing my ability to conjure up thoughts that even made sense.  
尽管我之前有过约会经历（好吧，其实只和 Mana 约会过一次），就连我也知道相亲很尴尬。当你是第一个到场的人时，等待相亲对象？那大概是尴尬历史中最尴尬的时刻之一了。我甚至开始丧失组织连贯思维的能力。

My brain had gone into overdrive as I imagined more little things that could and probably would go wrong. We hadn't even decided what movie we wanted to watch, so I had no idea whether we would be late or early. Would we make it in time to get good seats? Previews? What if she wanted to buy from the concession stand?  
我的大脑已经超速运转，想象着更多可能出错的小细节。我们甚至还没决定要看哪部电影，所以我完全不知道我们会迟到还是早到。我们能及时赶到抢到好座位吗？预告片呢？如果她想在小吃摊买东西怎么办？

Crap - Did she say 6:30 or 7:00? Was I supposed to wait for her outside or in? Maybe I was being stood up. I tried to casually loiter as much as I could on the sidewalk.  
糟糕——她说的是 6:30 还是 7:00？我应该在外面等她还是进去等？也许我被放鸽子了。我尽量自然地在人行道上徘徊。

Oh God, I thought, I was being stood up. I'd have to go back to the apartment and wait for my roommates to come back, when I would tell them what had happened. Asuka would laugh, Misato would be her usual encouraging self, and Pen-Pen… well, he had his own date to worry about. Toji and Kensuke would feel sorry for me in the morning too, while lamenting the latest squandered chance with the fairer sex. They would also put an emphasis on the word "sex", probably. At which point Hikari would drag Toji away by the ear and they'd start arguing like a married couple.  
哦天哪，我想，我被放鸽子了。我得回公寓等室友回来，然后告诉他们发生了什么。明日香会笑，美里会是她一贯的鼓励态度，而 Pen-Pen……好吧，他有他自己的约会要担心。真治和健介早上也会为我感到难过，同时哀叹又一次错失与异性交往的机会。他们可能还会特别强调“性”这个词。到时候光会拽着真治的耳朵把他拉走，然后他们就像一对夫妻一样开始争吵。

Things had never been this complicated when I was dating Mana. She had always been the one who dragged me everywhere… I was in the middle of wondering where she was when I felt a hand on my shoulder.  
和 Mana 交往时，事情从未如此复杂。她总是那个拉着我到处跑的人……我正想着她在哪儿，突然感到一只手搭在了我的肩膀上。

I almost jumped as I turned around to find an absolutely stunning girl smiling - SMILING at me. Nami was in a dark blue spaghetti-strap dress, filled out in all the right places; not too formal for the occasion, but nothing too revealing either. All thoughts of Mana were erased as I realized that this gorgeous girl was my date for the night.  
我几乎跳了起来，转身发现一个绝对迷人的女孩在对我微笑——微笑。Nami 穿着一件深蓝色的细肩带连衣裙，恰到好处地凸显了她的身材；既不太正式，也不太暴露。当我意识到这位美丽的女孩是我今晚的约会对象时，所有关于 Mana 的念头都消失了。

"Shinji?" Her voice was sweet – she seemed genuinely happy to see me.  
“真嗣？”她的声音甜美——她似乎真的很高兴见到我。

I nodded, trying to close my mouth.  
我点点头，试图合上嘴巴。

"Sorry I'm late, I had to put on my make-up and I had a fashion crisis… well, you know how girls are," she giggled.  
“抱歉我迟到了，我得化妆，还遇到了时尚危机……你知道的，女生嘛，”她咯咯笑道。

I barely managed to stammer a reply as she led me through the doors.  
在她领我穿过门时，我勉强结巴着回了一句。

Movies, I quickly learned, were not the best choice for a first date as I had thought they were. In comedies and romances on TV, this would be the place where the guy would yawn loudly and stretch his arm around the girl and pull her closer.  
我很快发现，电影并不是我原先认为的最佳初次约会选择。在电视上的喜剧和爱情片中，这通常是男生大声打哈欠，然后伸出手臂搂住女生，将她拉近的场景。

No matter how many times I had seen it done before, it seemed like the stupidest thing ever now that I was sitting in the theatre. Looking down, our hands were a few inches away from each other, albeit divided by the invisible line between our seats. I would have to cross over that imaginary boundary to reach hers.  
无论之前看过多少次这样的情节，现在坐在影院里，这一切似乎都变得无比愚蠢。低头一看，我们的手相距仅几英寸，尽管被我们座位之间的无形界限隔开。我必须跨越那条想象中的边界才能触碰到她的手。

As much as I would've loved to do either of those things, my arm refused to obey my command to move. I sneaked a glance at her a few times, gauging her potential reaction.  
尽管我非常想做其中任何一件事，但我的手臂却拒绝听从我的指令移动。我偷偷瞥了她几眼，揣测她可能的反应。

Nami seemed oblivious to my conundrum, reaching from the bag of popcorn on my lap and popping a kernel into her mouth as she stared at the screen.  
娜美似乎对我的困惑浑然不觉，从我腿上的爆米花袋里伸手抓了一把，边盯着屏幕边将一颗玉米粒塞进嘴里。

Great, I thought, she's more interested in the movie than me. I decided I might as well pay attention too.  
好吧，我想，她对电影的兴趣比对我还大。我决定我也该专心看电影了。

A giant computer-generated monster grabbed the hero's robot in one of its long tentacles. Not remotely terrifying, by any means, but Nami suddenly gasped in surprise and snuggled in close to me, inviting me to put my arm around her, where her hand immediately grabbed mine.  
一只巨大的电脑生成怪物用它的一条长触手抓住了英雄的机器人。虽然一点也不吓人，但娜美突然惊呼一声，紧靠着我，示意我搂住她，她的手随即紧紧握住了我的手。

Our hands were still intertwined as we left the theatre.  
我们的手依旧紧紧相握，离开剧院时也是如此。

"Ummm," I started, searching for something to talk about. Nami giggled, probably at my clumsiness. "How did you like the movie?" I asked.  
"嗯……" 我开始寻找话题，娜美可能是因为我的笨拙而轻笑出声。"你觉得电影怎么样？" 我问道。

"It wasn't bad," she replied, "but really, I wasn't paying that much attention to it. She gave me another one of her dazzling smiles.  
"还不错，" 她回答，"不过说实话，我并没有太专心看。" 她又给了我一个迷人的微笑。

Now, smiles can have a variety of effects. There's ones that make me feel warm all over, like when Rei smiled at me for the first time. There's ones that make me feel like I'm about to be eaten alive, like the way Asuka smiles at me almost every time she smiles at me. And there's ones that tell me I'm about to be asked to do something I don't want to do, like when Misato asks me to take out the trash on her day.  
笑容有着各种各样的效果。有些让我感到全身温暖，就像丽第一次对我微笑时那样。有些则让我觉得仿佛要被生吞活剥，比如明日香几乎每次对我微笑时的那种。还有些笑容告诉我，我即将被要求做些我不想做的事，比如美里在她那天让我倒垃圾的时候。

Nami's smile, on the other hand, was designed to both stun and let me know she actually liked me – it reminded me a lot of what Mana had done before. Toji was right – being an Evangelion pilot did have its perks at times. When I told the guys about Nami, they'd probably wonder where to sign up as pilots…  
而娜美的微笑，则是为了既让我目眩神迷，又让我知道她真的喜欢我——这让我想起了玛娜之前的所作所为。剑介说得对——成为 EVA 驾驶员有时确实有它的好处。当我告诉那帮家伙关于娜美的事时，他们大概会好奇去哪里报名当驾驶员吧……

When I had finally walked her home and taken the train back to the apartment, it was almost one in the morning. I expected the apartment to be deserted, but the lights in the dining room were still on, as I stepped through the entrance.  
当我终于送她回家并乘电车回到公寓时，时间已近凌晨一点。我以为公寓会空无一人，但当我走进门时，餐厅的灯还亮着。

Asuka sat at the table, in her housecoat, glass of water on the table. It was the same glass as the one she had cracked the other day.  
明日香坐在桌前，穿着她的家居服，桌上放着一杯水。这杯子和她前几天打碎的那个一模一样。

"Are Misato and Pen-Pen back yet?" I asked. Probably not – given the fact that Pen-Pen was at least Misato's equal in drinking, if not better, they'd probably be out till much, much later.  
“美里和企鹅潘回来了吗？”我问道。可能还没有——考虑到潘至少在喝酒方面能和美里平分秋色，甚至更胜一筹，他们大概会玩到很晚很晚。

"No. Misato left a message saying they wouldn't be home till really late."  
“没有。美里留了条信息说他们要很晚才能回家。”

I hummed in response, taking off my jacket. I didn't notice Asuka's listless tone – I was too cheerful from the date to think about things around me.  
我哼了一声作为回应，脱下外套。我没有注意到明日香无精打采的语气——约会后的喜悦让我无暇顾及周围的事物。

"How was your it? Your date, I mean." Asuka asked. She seemed bored; head tilted, resting on her arms at a horizontal angle. It was a familiar pose; the last time I had seen it, we had ended up in a kiss.  
“你的约会怎么样？我是说，你的约会。”明日香问道。她看起来很无聊；头倾斜着，靠在横放的手臂上。这是一个熟悉的姿势；上次我看到这个姿势时，我们最终吻在了一起。

"It went fine," I said. "We just watched a movie, went to dinner, and I walked her home." That's right, I thought, stick to the facts.  
“挺好的，”我说。“我们只是看了一场电影，吃了晚饭，然后我送她回家。”没错，我想，坚持事实。

She looked up, face contorted in anger. But there had been a lingering expression of sorrow just before, so quick that if I had blinked I would've missed it.  
她抬起头，脸上满是愤怒的扭曲。但在那之前，有一丝悲伤的表情稍纵即逝，快得我若眨眼便会错过。

"Asuka?" I was confused at her sudden mood swing. The truth was that I really hadn't kissed my date – not even good-bye.  
“明日香？”我对她突如其来的情绪转变感到困惑。事实上，我根本没有亲吻我的约会对象——连告别吻都没有。

"You make me _sick_," her voice had dropped to a deathly quiet, but harsh tone, filled with sarcasm. "Ooh, the invincible Shinji, we girls should be grateful that he even gives us the time of day. First Wondergirl, then the bitch, and now the whore? I _can't stand_ you."  
“你让我恶心，”她的声音降到了死寂般的低沉，却带着尖锐的讽刺。“哦，无敌的真嗣，我们这些女孩应该感激他甚至愿意花时间在我们身上。先是奇迹女孩，然后是婊子，现在又是妓女？我无法忍受你。”

And in a flash of auburn hair, she was gone, glass of water left on the table.  
一瞬间，她那赤褐色的头发闪过，人已不见，只剩一杯水留在桌上。

Even I knew that something was terribly amiss.  
就连我也知道，有什么事情严重不对劲。

---

Sleep was hard to come by that night - my mind was swirling. I was giddy, from the fabulous events of the night; confused, from the surprising events of the early morning.  
那一晚，入睡变得困难——我的思绪纷乱。夜晚的精彩事件让我兴奋不已；清晨的意外则让我感到困惑。

Misato and Pen-Pen stumbled home sometime in the middle of the night – the sound of the two of them staggering around in the hallway, drunk, came and went quickly as they clambered to their respective rooms. Before long, the sounds of movement stopped; the only noise from cicadas buzzing outside.  
美里和企鹅 Pen-Pen 在深夜时分跌跌撞撞地回到家——两人在走廊上醉醺醺地摇晃的声音很快传来又消失，他们各自挣扎着回到房间。不久，活动的声响停止了；只剩下外面蝉鸣的噪音。

At some point, I resolved to get up early to make a peace offering with Asuka's lunch – food was something she understood.  
不知何时，我下定决心要早起为明日香准备一份和解的午餐——食物是她能理解的东西。

I had just finished wrapping up our lunchboxes and thrown the pans into the sink when I heard Asuka's door open and the bathroom door close. I decided that now would be the best time to change into our school clothes.  
我刚把我们的便当盒包好，把锅扔进水槽，就听到明日香的房门打开，浴室门关上的声音。我决定现在是换上校服的最佳时机。

Pen-Pen and Misato's doors were still closed; I doubt either of them would be up soon. Misato had even arranged to take the day off in anticipation of a massive hangover. The sound of the shower stopping signalled that I had about ten minutes before we'd be face to face and alone in the apartment.  
Pen-Pen 和美里小姐的房门依旧紧闭；我怀疑他们俩都不会很快起床。美里甚至特意请了一天假，以防宿醉严重。淋浴声停止的信号表明，我大约还有十分钟就要和她在公寓里面对面独处了。

The bathroom door opened, and Asuka's door closed.  
浴室门打开了，明日香的房门也随之关闭。

Breakfast was ready on the table, but I wanted to be waiting for Asuka when she came out. More reactive than proactive, I waited outside her room for her.  
早餐已经摆在桌上，但我希望在明日香出来时能等她。我更倾向于被动反应而非主动出击，于是就在她房间外等着她。

"Morn-" "早-"

"I don't have anything to say to you," Asuka cut me off, brusquely walking to the front door. Her bag was slung over her shoulder; she was already fully dressed for the day.  
"我没什么要跟你说的，" 明日香打断我，快步走向前门。她的包斜挎在肩上；她已经完全准备好迎接新的一天了。

"But-" "但是-"

Asuka stormed out of the apartment, shoes in hand.  
明日香怒气冲冲地走出公寓，手里还抓着鞋子。

I ran to the door after her, but the echo of footsteps down the stairs was all that was left of her.  
我追到门口，却只听见她下楼的脚步声在回荡。

---

The walk to school was uneventful – I had grown used to Asuka's chatter in the mornings. Instead, I was left with my thoughts for company again, rehashing the same points over and over in my mind. I took my time, too; I barely made it into the class before morning bell rang.  
去学校的路上一切如常——我已经习惯了早上明日香叽叽喳喳的声音。这次，我只能独自思考，一遍遍在脑海中重复那些问题。我走得很慢，几乎在早读铃响前一刻才踏进教室。

"You dog, had a late night, didn't you?" Toji managed to whisper to me before we took our seats. I didn't reply – instead, I looked at Asuka. She seemed to radiate contempt, but maybe that was just me.  
“你这狗，昨晚熬夜了吧？”我们坐下前，阿斯兰设法对我耳语道。我没有回答——而是看向明日香。她似乎散发着轻蔑的气息，但也许那只是我的错觉。

I opened my computer and started the messaging program which so many of us used to entertain ourselves as the teacher droned on. It was incredible that the school had decided to give us the terminals in the first place – as the adults had absolutely no idea that most of us would misuse them. Kensuke, resident computer genius, had even rigged a program that would change our screens to a full document of "fake notes" with the touch of a screen.  
我打开电脑，启动了那个在我们听老师喋喋不休时用来消遣的通讯程序。学校最初决定给我们配备终端真是不可思议——大人们完全不知道我们大多数人会滥用它们。电脑高手真希波甚至编写了一个程序，只需轻触屏幕就能将我们的屏幕切换成满屏的“假笔记”。

Asuka wasn't online. Toji and Kensuke were, and they bombarded me with messages, but I was in no mood to deal with them. Instead I flipped down my monitor and took a page from the Rei school of thought – staring outside obliviously. If there was ever a day when I wished I could stay home under the covers, it was today.  
明日香不在线。阿斯兰和真希波在，他们不停地给我发消息，但我没心情应付他们。相反，我合上显示器，效仿丽的方式——茫然地凝视窗外。如果有一天我希望自己能躲在家里不出门，那就是今天。

Delirious from lack of sleep, dreams became reality. The classroom was suddenly filled with people who obviously weren't students.  
因缺乏睡眠而神志不清，梦境变成了现实。教室里突然挤满了显然不是学生的人。

Kaji started offering to teach me some of his patented tricks in bed. Dr. Akagi preached to me about the importance of protection during sex. Asuka yelled at me and asked me if I wanted to kiss. My father told me that I would only cause more pain to those I became involved with. And Rei, the only sane person there, asked me if I was alright.  
加持开始主动教我一些他独创的床上技巧。赤城博士向我宣讲性行为中保护措施的重要性。明日香对我大喊大叫，问我是否想接吻。我父亲告诉我，我只会给那些与我扯上关系的人带来更多痛苦。而绫波，那里唯一理智的人，问我是否还好。

Rei repeated the question again.  
绫波再次重复了这个问题。

And again. 又一次。

Oh, no, she was asking me that now. What?  
哦，不，她现在问我这个。什么？

My head snapped up as the last vestiges of sleep were erased from my mind. My dreams were becoming way too literal.  
我猛地抬起头，睡意完全从脑海中消失。我的梦变得太过直白了。

"Are you alright, Ikari?" Rei asked for the fourth time. I was now acutely aware of my surroundings. People were still filing off to lunch. Rei stood above me, waiting for my reply.  
"碇，你还好吗？" 绫波第四次问道。我现在明显感觉到周围的环境。人们还在陆续去吃午饭。绫波站在我上方，等待我的回答。

"Yeah," I replied. "Just a bit tired." I rubbed my eyes a bit and yawned, as if to make my point clear.  
"嗯，" 我回答。"只是有点累。" 我揉了揉眼睛，打了个哈欠，好像是为了强调我的观点。

"You should probably go to bed earlier," Rei offered. She turned to go.  
"你或许应该早点睡觉，" 绫波建议道。她转身离开。

"Hey, w-wait!" A certain redhead was nowhere to be found. "Where did Asuka go?"  
"嘿，等，等等！"某个红发女孩不见了踪影。"明日香去哪儿了？"

"Pilot Soryu and Ms. Horaki went to lunch five minutes ago," Rei answered. "I believe her exact words as they left were 'Shinji is a moron'."  
"飞行员惣流和洞木小姐五分钟前去吃午饭了，"绫波回答道。"我相信她们离开时说的原话是'真嗣是个白痴'。"

I groaned and checked my bag. Yep, the lunch I had prepared for her was still there. She must've gone off to share Hikari's lunch. Toji and Kensuke had already left, probably expecting me to catch up later. I didn't feel like submitting myself to interrogation about my date, so I had another idea.  
我叹了口气，检查了一下我的包。没错，我为她准备的午餐还在那里。她一定是去和光一起吃午饭了。东治和健介已经离开了，大概是期待我稍后跟上。我不想接受关于我约会的盘问，所以我有了另一个主意。

"Hey Rei, I have an extra bento. Wanna join me for lunch?"  
"嘿，丽，我多带了一份便当。一起吃午饭好吗？"

---

The roof was surprisingly deserted, as we sat down and opened the boxes I had prepared. Rei looked at the more exotic sushi and teriyaki in the package with disdain, and started on the vegetarian sushi rolls. Her lunch, a box of rice and some vegetable sticks, lay forgotten.  
屋顶出乎意料地空旷，我们坐下并打开了我准备的盒子。丽看着包装中较为异国的寿司和照烧肉，面露不屑，转而开始吃素寿司卷。她的午餐，一盒米饭和一些蔬菜条，被遗忘了。

"Rei, can I ask you something?" Maybe she could help me with my dilemma. She nodded to me, mouth full of rice.  
"丽，我能问你件事吗？"也许她能帮我解决我的难题。她对我点点头，嘴里塞满了米饭。

"What do you think of Asuka?"  
"你觉得明日香怎么样？"

"I don't understand the question," Rei replied. She stopped eating.  
"我不明白这个问题，" 绫波回答道。她停止了进食。

"Not as a pilot," I elaborated, "but as a person. She always says what she thinks of you. What do you think of her?"  
"不是作为驾驶员，" 我进一步解释，"而是作为一个人。她总是说她对你的看法。你对她的看法是什么？"

Rei took a moment to contemplate the question. I stood up against the railing and looked down at the other students as they enjoyed their lunches.  
丽在思考这个问题时停顿了一下。我站起身来，靠在栏杆上，俯视着其他学生享受午餐的情景。

"There are hidden portions of her heart locked away, memories which she wishes never existed. She has known great pain. It is easier to lock ourselves away and hurt others than to expose our deepest hopes and fears."  
“她的心中隐藏着一些被锁起来的部分，那些她希望从未存在的记忆。她经历过巨大的痛苦。封闭自己，伤害他人，总比暴露我们最深切的希望和恐惧来得容易。”

I digested this for a second.  
我对此沉思了一会儿。

"But what she truly longs for," Rei continued, "is to love, and to be loved."  
"但她真正渴望的，" 丽继续说道，"是去爱，也被爱。"

"Asuka?" I said. "How can you tell all this anyway?"  
"明日香？" 我说。"你怎么能知道这一切呢？"

"You asked for my opinion," Rei said. "You shouldn't be so surprised; everyone is capable of love," Rei answered. "Even you. Thank you for the lunch, Ikari."  
"你征求了我的意见，" 丽说。"你不该这么惊讶；每个人都有爱的能力，" 丽回答。"甚至你也是。谢谢你的午餐，碇。"

I sat there in contemplation as she got up to go back to class. She was already through the door when the bell rang.  
我坐在那里沉思，她起身返回教室。她刚穿过门，铃声就响了。

---

The rest of the day went by quickly. I didn't try to stop Asuka as she left without a word. Toji and Kensuke, however, would not be deterred. They cornered me in front of the school and demanded to hear details about my date, no matter how sordid. In fact, the more sordid, the better.  
那天剩下的时间过得很快。我没有试图阻止明日香一言不发地离开。然而，剑介和冬二却不肯罢休。他们在学校门口堵住我，非要我详细讲述约会的细节，不管多么不堪。实际上，越是不堪，他们越感兴趣。

My excitement from the previous night had been completely erased, but I couldn't deny Toji and Kensuke their joy at hearing about it. I told them how the night went, from movie, to dinner afterwards, to the walk home.  
前一晚的兴奋感已荡然无存，但我无法拒绝剑介和冬二听故事的乐趣。我告诉他们那个夜晚是如何度过的，从电影，到之后的晚餐，再到步行回家。

Toji, excited to no end, checked to see if the class rep was listening, and asked what I had been expecting. "Did you get to second base?"  
冬二兴奋得不得了，检查了一下班长是否在听，然后问了我一直期待的问题。“你到二垒了吗？”

"Well… no," I honestly answered with a blush. "Nothing like that!"  
“呃…没有，”我红着脸老实回答，“没那种事！”

"What?!" Kensuke practically yelled. "You had a babe like that and you didn't even try to cop a feel?"  
“什么？！”剑介几乎是大声喊了出来，“你跟那么正的妹子在一起，居然连摸都没摸一下？”

"Come on, guys," I sheepishly replied, "Stop it with the baseball analogies already."  
"拜托，伙计们，" 我尴尬地回答，"别再用棒球比喻了。"

"Well, are you seeing her again?!" Toji was borderline hysteric.  
"那你还见她吗？！" 冬二几乎要歇斯底里了。"

"I have her phone number…" I offered.  
"我有她的电话号码……" 我提供道。"

The two grinned in approval.  
两人相视而笑，表示赞同。

"That's my boy!" Toji thumped me on the back. "Now, you have to wait three days before you do – otherwise, she'll think you're a desperate loser and dump you."  
"那是我儿子！" 冬二拍了拍我的背。"现在，你得等上三天才能行动——否则，她会认为你是个绝望的失败者，然后甩了你。"

"I don't know if I'm even going to use it," I said.  
"我不知道我是否会用到它，" 我说。

To them, I might as well have said that I was moving to Germany.  
对他们来说，我这么说就像是在告诉他们我要搬去德国一样。

"Are you crazy? A gorgeous girl like that?" An anguished Toji, now fully hysteric.  
“你疯了吗？那么漂亮的女孩？” 痛苦不堪的冬二，现在完全歇斯底里了。

"What?! If you're not going to use it, can I?" Kensuke, more practical than anything.  
“什么？！如果你不用，我能用吗？” 真嗣，比任何人都实际。

"Well, I've had a lot on my mind…" I explained.  
"嗯，我最近心里装了很多事……" 我解释道。

"What could be more important than THIS?" Toji and Kensuke said simultaneously.  
"还有什么比这更重要的？" 冬二和真希同时说道。

Uh-oh. I had boxed myself in. If I told the truth and said Asuka, the two of them would probably faint. My mind scrambled to find another topic to use. The problem was, the alternatives that came to mind were even worse – they both knew I hated Evangelion, saying my mind was on other girls would get them even more riled up, and Pen-Pen's dating life, no matter how much bros cared about each other before hos, was not a sufficient excuse.  
哎呀，我把自己困住了。如果我说实话提到明日香，他们俩可能会晕倒。我的大脑急速运转，寻找另一个话题。问题是，想到的替代方案更糟糕——他们都知道我讨厌《福音战士》，说我心里想着其他女孩会让他们更加激动，而 Pen-Pen 的恋爱生活，不管兄弟情谊在先，都不是一个充分的借口。

"Asuka," I mumbled. “明日香，”我咕哝道。

They both fainted. On the bright side, they stopped asking me about my love life.  
他们俩都晕倒了。不过好在，他们不再追问我关于恋爱的事了。

---

When I got back to the apartment, Pen-Pen was already ready for his second date. Both pet and owner seemed rested from their hangovers from the previous night, and ready for round two.  
当我回到公寓时，Pen-Pen 已经准备好迎接他的第二次约会了。无论是宠物还是主人，似乎都从昨晚的宿醉中恢复过来，准备迎接第二轮。

"How was Pen-Pen's date?" I asked.  
“Pen-Pen 的约会怎么样？”我问道。

"It was fun, but they didn't really hit it off," Misato answered. "One look at her, and Pen-Pen didn't really want to stay. She didn't really like him, either."  
“挺有趣的，但他们并没有真正来电，”美里回答，“一看她，Pen-Pen 就不太想待下去了。她也不太喜欢他。”

Pen-Pen warked in agreement.  
Pen-Pen 表示同意地叫了一声。

"One look?" I asked. "Doesn't that seem a bit shallow?"  
"一眼定情？" 我问，"这听起来是不是有点肤浅？"

"It's not necessarily the _look_ of a penguin that matters," Misato explained. "It's like love at first sight – you just know that something's going to work out or not. It's gut instinct!"  
"关键并不在于企鹅的外表，" 美里解释道，"就像一见钟情一样——你只是知道某件事会不会成功。这是直觉！"

Misato had never been the academic type. "And you know this… how?" I asked.  
美里从来不是那种学术型的人。"你是怎么知道这些的？" 我问。

"The zoologist explained it to me. He was pretty cute," Misato sighed. "Too bad he had to take her back to the zoo. Well, that's alright, we had fun, didn't we?"  
"动物学家向我解释了。他挺可爱的，"美里叹息道。"可惜他得把她带回动物园。不过没关系，我们玩得很开心，不是吗？"

Pen-Pen warked again. Pen-Pen 又叫了一声。

"Our next date's in an hour, want to come?" Misato offered. Asuka wasn't home again, and spending the afternoon alone in the apartment wasn't appealing.  
"我们下一约会是一个小时后，想来吗？"美里提议道。明日香又不在家，独自在公寓度过下午并不吸引人。

"Okay," I said. “好的，”我说。

---

Pen-Pen's "date" turned out to be a life-sized penguin doll.  
Pen-Pen 的‘约会’对象原来是一个真人大小的企鹅玩偶。

"Wark?" Pen-pen nudged it a bit with his beak. Then, he started to climb on top and…  
“哇克？”Pen-Pen 用喙轻轻推了推它。随后，他开始爬到玩偶上面，然后……

"That's it, we're going!" Misato quickly decided. She pulled Pen-Pen off and dragged him away by the flipper.  
"就这样，我们走吧！" 美里迅速决定。她把 Pen-Pen 拽下来，拖着他离开，用的是他的蹼。

"WAARRK!!!" "哇尔克！！！"

"No, we can't keep it."  
"不行，我们不能留着它。"

---

Misato sped us back to the apartment at her usual breakneck pace, muttering obscenities under her breath about "Craigslist" and "perverted wackos". The owner of the doll had taken Misato for someone with a penguin doll fetish, it had turned out. I don't think I've ever seen Misato so embarrassed.  
美里以她一贯的极快速度把我们送回了公寓，嘴里低声咒骂着“Craigslist”和“变态怪人”。原来，玩偶的主人把美里当成了有企鹅玩偶癖好的人。我想我从未见过美里如此尴尬。

"How old is Pen-Pen, anyway?" I asked. During the afternoon, I had decided to quickly research Penguin mating habits. According to the internet, normal Penguins reached sexual maturity anywhere from three to eight years old. Then again, Pen-Pen was the first of his kind.  
“话说，Pen-Pen 到底多大了？”我问道。下午的时候，我决定快速研究一下企鹅的繁殖习性。根据网上的资料，普通企鹅达到性成熟期大约在三到八岁之间。不过，Pen-Pen 可是独一无二的。

"I don't know, actually," Misato admitted. "He was at the research lab when I started working there during university – and that was a long time ago."  
“其实我也不清楚，”美里承认道，“我上大学开始在那里工作时，他就已经在研究所了——那是很久以前的事了。”

I did the mental math.  
我在心里算了算。

"Just how old _are_ you?" I laughed.  
“你到底多大了？”我笑着问。

Misato stammered as her eye twitched.  
美里结结巴巴地说着，眼角微微抽搐。

---

Instead of heading back inside, I decided to take a walk. The sun was still up – though already beginning its descent. The sky was painted a thick reddish orange hue. I liked Tokyo-3 at times like this; reminiscent of the first time Misato had shown me the fortress city in all its glory.  
我没有返回室内，而是决定去散个步。太阳还未落山——尽管已经开始西沉。天空被染成了一片浓重的红橙色。我喜欢东京-3 在此时此刻的样子；让人想起第一次美里带我领略这座堡垒城市全貌的情景。

I had walked a block when I spotted Asuka on the other side of the street, coming back. Maybe it was the sunlit background on her crimson hair, or maybe it was that my date had given me a backbone, but I decided to confront the red-haired demon head on. The shape of a plan started to form in my mind.  
我走过一个街区时，看到明日香在对面的街上回来。或许是她那被阳光照亮的赤红头发，又或许是我与约会对象的相处让我有了勇气，我决定直面这位红发魔女。一个计划开始在我脑海中成型。

"HEY, ASUKA!" I yelled, hurriedly crossing before she had a chance to run away. She looked at me with a mixture of disgust and apathy as I caught up.  
“嘿，明日香！”我大喊着，急忙穿过马路，不给她逃跑的机会。当我追上她时，她看着我，眼神中混杂着厌恶和冷漠。

"What do you want?" Asuka was nowhere near as furious as the night before - more irritated than anything else.  
"你想要什么？" 明日香远没有前一晚那么愤怒——更多的是感到烦躁。

"Where are you going?" An innocent question.  
"你要去哪儿？" 一个无辜的问题。

"What does it look like, stupid? I'm going back to the apartment."  
"看起来像什么，傻瓜？我要回公寓。"

I took a quick glance at my watch – I had maybe an hour.  
我迅速瞥了一眼手表——大概还有一个小时。

"Do you want to come with me somewhere? I've got a surprise."  
“你想跟我去个地方吗？我有个惊喜。”

"What kind of surprise?" Asuka eyed me suspiciously, like I was planning to take her to a deserted shack and murder her.  
“什么样的惊喜？” 明日香怀疑地盯着我，仿佛我打算带她去一个荒废的小屋然后谋杀她。

"What kind of surprise would it be if I told you?" I grinned, channelling my inner Kaji.  
"如果我告诉你了，那还叫什么惊喜？" 我咧嘴笑着，调动内心的加持君。

"And what about food?" Asuka questioned. I could tell her curiosity was getting the better of her.  
"那食物怎么办？" 明日香问道。我能看出她的好奇心占了上风。

"We can pick something up on the way," I offered. "Besides, it's Misato's night to cook – do you really want instant noodles with curry again?"  
"我们可以在路上买点，" 我提议道，"再说，今晚是美里做饭——你真的还想再吃咖喱味的速食面吗？"

That cinched it. The first time Asuka had tried that particular specialty of Misato's, despite my warning, she had spent all night in the washroom cursing in German our guardian.  
这下没跑了。第一次阿斯卡尝试了美里那道特别的菜肴，尽管我事先警告过她，结果她整晚都在洗手间里用德语咒骂我们的监护人。

"Alright, but don't get any funny ideas, Third child."  
“好吧，但别有什么奇怪的想法，第三适格者。”

---

"Come on!" I gasped, "we can't miss that train!"  
“快点！”我喘着气说，“我们不能错过那班火车！”

The trip to the grocery store had taken longer than I had anticipated – Asuka was picky about her beverage and meal choices, even with convenience store food. Honestly, how do you take twenty minutes to decide what you want at a 7-11? We had only gotten out of there when I threatened to go out of the store by myself. Even then, Asuka had made me pay for our purchases as punishment for rushing her and dragging her to "god-knows-where" ("This is not a date!" she had exclaimed).  
去杂货店的行程比我想象的要长——明日香对饮料和餐食的选择非常挑剔，即便是便利店的食物也不例外。说真的，你怎么能在 7-11 花二十分钟决定自己想要什么？我们直到我威胁要自己离开商店时才得以脱身。即便如此，明日香还是让我为我们的购物买单，作为对她匆忙决定的惩罚，并强行带她去“鬼知道哪里”（“这不是约会！”她大声声明）。

If we missed the train, we'd be screwed. I grabbed Asuka's arm and pulled her ahead as I broke into a run. Our bags clattered as we went down the escalator, barely squeezing past some startled commuters. I apologized as we rushed by, without particularly meaning it. The train was _that_ important.  
如果我们错过了火车，那就麻烦了。我抓住明日香的手臂，拉着她向前跑去。我们的袋子随着我们下电梯而叮当作响，几乎擦过一些受惊的通勤者。我们匆匆而过时，我道了歉，虽然并不真心。那趟火车至关重要。

We got in ahead of the closing doors, at which time I noticed that my hand was still gripping her wrist tightly.  
我们在车门关闭前挤了进去，这时我注意到我的手仍然紧紧抓着她的手腕。

"Sorry," I said, immediately letting go. For once, Asuka didn't yell at me for apologizing. I suppose she chose to let it slide.  
“对不起，”我立刻松开了手。这一次，明日香没有因为我道歉而对我大吼大叫。我想她是选择放我一马。

We took seats perpendicular from one another. The ride was spent mostly in silence – my temporary boost of courage only extended to convincing Asuka to come, it turned out.  
我们相对而坐。大部分时间里，我们都在沉默中度过——我的勇气只是暂时性的，只够说服明日香跟我一起来，结果证明如此。

Our only conversation came when we called Misato to let her know we wouldn't be home for dinner. Misato was surprised, but she told us to have fun – it was a Friday, after all. I had a sneaking suspicion she would, instead of cooking, take Pen-Pen out for round two of drinks.  
我们唯一的对话发生在给美里打电话告诉她我们不回家吃晚饭的时候。美里很惊讶，但她让我们好好玩——毕竟今天是星期五。我暗自怀疑她不会做饭，而是会带 Pen-Pen 出去喝第二轮酒。

We arrived at our stop a bit earlier than expected. I glanced at my watch again. We would make it, but only just.  
我们比预期早了一点到达站点。我又瞥了一眼手表。我们能赶到，但只是勉强。

Asuka was starting to get impatient. "How much further do we have to go? Why the hell are we here?"  
明日香开始变得不耐烦。"我们还要走多远？我们到底为什么要来这里？"

A good question – we had gone north outside the Tokyo-3 city limits. The phrase "Shinji Ikari, serial killer" was probably starting to flash through her mind.  
这是个好问题——我们向北走出了第三新东京市的范围。"碇真嗣，连环杀手"这个词组可能已经开始在她脑海中闪现。

"Just a bit further," I answered.  
"再走几步就到了," 我回答道。

We exited the station, and I led her up the road a bit to a small lookout. It was the same place Misato had taken me after my first Angel battle. The sun was almost beyond the horizon – barely peeking through the smaller buildings.  
我们走出车站，我带着她沿着路走了一段，来到一个小小的观景台。这个地方和美里在我第一次与使徒战斗后带我来的地方一样。太阳几乎已经落山，只有一丝余晖透过较矮的建筑缝隙中透出来。

"Here we are," I said, rummaging through our grocery bags to start laying out a picnic of sorts. "I thought you needed this. Think of it as my way of making up for whatever I did."  
"我们到了，" 我说着，开始从购物袋里翻找，准备铺开一场即兴的野餐。"我想你需要这个。就当是我弥补我所做的一切的方式吧。"

Asuka opened her mouth, perhaps to tell me exactly what I had done wrong, but thought better of it.  
明日香张开嘴，或许是想告诉我我到底做错了什么，但转念一想又作罢了。

"Nice try, third child," she exclaimed in her mock-arrogant voice. "But you'll have to do a lot better to make it up to me."  
“不错嘛，第三适格者，”她用那副假装傲慢的语气喊道，“但要想弥补，你还得做得更好才行。”

I laughed as she joined me in setting up dinner. We started to dig in.  
她加入我一起准备晚餐时，我笑了。我们开始大快朵颐。

As we took our first bites, a large siren rang throughout the city, signalling the rise of Tokyo-3, mankind's fortress city. Just like the first time, skyscrapers started to grow out of the ground, illuminated in orange by the setting sun. The lake glistened in the background as we watched the structures grow, like beanstalks out of a fairytale.  
当我们咬下第一口时，整个城市响起了一阵巨大的警报声，标志着第三新东京市的崛起，人类的前哨城市。就像第一次那样，摩天大楼开始从地面冒出，在落日的橙光中熠熠生辉。湖水在背景中闪烁，我们看着这些建筑如同童话中的豆茎般生长。

I glanced over at my roommate – she looked right back at me. Her eyes glanced at me with a curious glint, as if to ask why.  
我瞥了一眼我的室友——她也正好回望我。她的眼神中带着一丝好奇的光芒，仿佛在问为什么。

"Misato brought me here when I first moved in," I explained. "It's good to see now and then what we're fighting to protect, don't you think?"  
“美里在我刚搬进来时带我来过这里，”我解释道，“偶尔看看我们为之奋斗保护的东西，你不觉得很好吗？”

Asuka didn't answer me, so I continued.  
明日香没有回答我，于是我继续说道。

"And I thought you needed this."  
“我还以为你需要这个。”

"You idiot," she replied softly. She was smiling.  
“你这个笨蛋，”她轻声回答，脸上带着微笑。

Asuka was giving me one of those smiles that made me feel warm – except disarming at the same time, with a hint of mischief. I grinned like an idiot. At that moment, it seemed like the world only existed for me, and I started to think Asuka liked me; more than just as a fellow pilot, or a roommate.  
明日香给了我一个那样的微笑，让我感到温暖——只是同时又让人放下戒备，带着一丝调皮。我像个傻瓜一样咧嘴笑了。那一刻，仿佛世界只为我存在，我开始觉得明日香喜欢我；不仅仅是作为战友，或是室友。

In fact, the smile was so disarming that I forgot where I was – instead, our heads tilted closer to each other ever so slightly. It one of those moments from a cheesy romance movie or TV show again, where the guy and girl would slowly kiss, their sexual tension so obvious it could've been spelled out. Except, unlike with Nami, this time it was actually playing out to the script.  
事实上，那个微笑如此让人放下戒备，以至于我忘记了身在何处——相反，我们的头微微倾斜，彼此靠近。这就像那些俗套的浪漫电影或电视剧里的时刻，男女主角会慢慢接吻，他们的性张力如此明显，简直可以明明白白地写出来。只是，与娜美不同，这次真的按照剧本上演了。

Closer and closer we leaned, until our noses were so agonizingly close that we could feel each other's breath.  
我们越靠越近，直到我们的鼻子近得令人痛苦，能感受到对方的呼吸。

Oh no, I thought. She's going to hold my nose again.  
哦不，我想。她又要捏我鼻子了。

Last time, all I wanted was for her to let me breathe. This time, suffocation would've seemed preferable to what she did instead – as our lips almost touched, she turned her head abruptly and pulled away.  
上次，我只希望她能让我呼吸。这次，窒息似乎都比她所做的要好——就在我们的嘴唇几乎要碰上时，她突然转过头，猛地抽身离开。

Instead of a kiss, I got a question.  
没有吻，我得到的是一个问题。

"Did you kiss _her_?" It took me a second to realize who she had meant.  
"你亲她了吗？" 我愣了一下才反应过来她指的是谁。

"Did you kiss her?" She repeated, almost snarling.  
"你亲她了吗？" 她重复道，几乎是咆哮着。

"No!" I blurted out; I hadn't expected that question to come up.  
"没有！" 我脱口而出；没想到会问到这个问题。

She seemed pleased with the answer for a moment, then continued with her questions.  
她似乎对这个回答感到满意，但随即又继续提问。

"Are you going out with the whore again?" Asuka's eyes were narrow in slits.  
“你又要和那个婊子出去吗？”明日香眯起了眼睛。

I didn't quite know how to answer that. I had Nami's phone number, but I hadn't thought about calling her. Misato's order only extended to one date. A second date would make my intentions loud and clear. Toji and Kensuke's opinions on calling girls came to mind. The problem was, I didn't know what my intentions even were.  
我不知该如何回答。我有娜美的电话号码，但从未想过要打给她。美里只命令我进行一次约会。第二次约会会让我意图昭然若揭。我想起了真治和健介对给女孩打电话的看法。问题是，我甚至不知道自己的意图是什么。

Regardless, Asuka took my silence for an answer, and slapped me hard across my cheek. I looked at her in shock for a second; tears had started to well up in her eyes.  
尽管如此，明日香把我的沉默当成了回答，狠狠地扇了我一巴掌。我震惊地看着她，她的眼眶已经开始泛泪。

Then she ran. 然后她跑开了。

---

Now, I'm not great at reading people, especially girls, but it all seemed to fit together – that afternoon of scathing looks from Hikari, Asuka's comments about my dating life. Even the whole time I was with Mana, Asuka would either insult her or just storm off altogether. It wasn't something I had picked up on at the time, but it was impossible to ignore twice in a row with another girl. It was egotistical of me, but I couldn't come up with any other explanation except that, against all odds, Asuka somehow had feelings for me.  
说实话，我不太擅长读懂人心，尤其是女孩子的，但这一切似乎都串联起来了——那天下午光严厉的眼神，明日香对我恋爱生活的评论。即使我和真奈在一起的时候，明日香要么是侮辱她，要么就直接甩手走人。当时我并没有察觉到，但连续两次对另一个女孩这样，实在让人无法忽视。虽然自恋，但我实在想不出其他解释，除了这个几乎不可能的事实：明日香不知怎的对我产生了感情。

Any joy I had felt from my successful planning had since ebbed away as I realized I may have just compounded problems.  
我因成功策划而感到的喜悦早已消退，当我意识到自己可能只是加剧了问题时。

The question had now become what I felt for her. Asuka was undeniably attractive, exotic with her red hair. Calling Asuka Langley Soryu beautiful was self-evident – half the population of our school either admired her from afar or had one of their love letters crushed underneath her shoes.  
现在的问题是我对她有什么感觉。明日香无疑很有魅力，她那一头红发显得异域风情。称明日香·兰格雷为美丽是显而易见的——我们学校的一半人要么远远地仰慕她，要么就是情书被她的鞋底碾碎。

But there was inner beauty and strength too. For all of her faults, she was _alive_ in the strictest sense of the word. More than anyone else I had ever known, she was exuberant and exciting; she brought out at least some sort of response in those around her (in Toji and Kensuke's case, it was a less-than-happy one). It was her magnetic personality that drew me to her, and her abrasive insults that pushed me away.  
但她也有内在的美和力量。尽管她有许多缺点，但她确实活得很真实。在我认识的人中，没有人比她更充满活力和令人兴奋；她总能激起周围人的某种反应（对真治和健介来说，这种反应并不愉快）。正是她那磁性的个性吸引了我，而她尖锐的侮辱又将我推开。

And then there was the kiss we had shared. Even without air it had been… not unpleasant. At least until I started to turn blue from air loss; but with Asuka, things were complicated – a bunch of contradictions wrapped around an enigma surrounded by a thorny, yet unbelievably beautiful exterior. The haughty woman who acted in arrogance was also a child crying out for in dreams for her mother. Maybe that was something we both had in common – that vulnerability at our core.  
然后是我们分享的那个吻。即便没有空气，那感觉也……并不讨厌。至少在我因缺氧开始变蓝之前；但和明日香在一起，事情总是复杂——一堆矛盾包裹着一个谜团，被一层棘手却又美得不可思议的外表环绕。那个傲慢自大的女人，同时也是在梦中呼唤母亲的孩童。也许这是我们共有的——内心深处的脆弱。

Rei's words echoed in my mind – she just wanted someone to love and to love her.  
丽的话语在我脑海中回响——她只是想要一个爱她并被她爱的人。

---

Pen-Pen's third date was on the Saturday, at the local park. This time, Misato insisted that we go out as a family for support, all of us. A dysfunctional one, perhaps, but a family, nonetheless. Asuka refused to look at me the entire day. Even on the drive over, Asuka purposely looked out the window, ignoring the fact that I was sitting next to her.  
Pen-Pen 的第三次约会定在周六，在当地公园。这次，美里坚持我们要全家出动去支持，所有人。或许是个功能失调的家庭，但终究是个家庭。明日香一整天都没看我一眼。甚至在开车过去的时候，明日香故意望向窗外，无视我坐在她旁边的事实。

Misato noticed, but either thought it was best left to us to settle it, or didn't think it was that serious. Instead, she paid more attention to Pen-Pen, and spent the ride talking to him about dating tips for the modern penguin (or rather, dating tips she had stolen from a magazine and modified slightly for penguins).  
美里注意到了，但她要么认为最好让我们自己解决，要么觉得这并不严重。相反，她更多地关注了 Pen-Pen，并在车上和他谈论现代企鹅的约会技巧（或者更确切地说，是她从一本杂志上偷来的并稍作修改以适应企鹅的约会技巧）。

We got out of the car, and Asuka started to walk away from me.  
我们下了车，明日香开始从我身边走开。

Fine, I thought, if she wanted to be like that, I didn't care. In my own petty fit of childish one-uppance, I started to walk in the opposite the opposite direction.  
好吧，我想，如果她想那样的话，我不在乎。出于自己幼稚的小小报复心理，我开始朝着相反的方向走去。

Instead of turning her eye this time, Misato grabbed both of us and held us tightly in a vice grip.  
这次，美里没有转身，而是紧紧抓住我们俩，用一种近乎钳制的力道将我们固定住。

"And where do you think you two are going?" She asked rhetorically.  
“你们俩以为自己要去哪儿？”她半开玩笑地问道。

Half-dragging the two of us, we made our way to the fountain. Pen-Pen's date was waiting there with her owner. In lieu of flowers, Misato had brought a shrink-wrapped salmon for a gift. Pinga, the female penguin, and her owner, a man who looked like he was in his early thirties, waved to us as we approached.  
她半拖半拽着我们俩，一路走到喷泉边。Pen-Pen 的约会对象已经在那里等候，连同她的主人。美里没有带花，而是带来了一块保鲜膜包裹的鲑鱼作为礼物。Pinga，那只雌性企鹅，以及她的主人——一个看起来三十岁出头的男子，在我们走近时向我们挥手致意。

To be honest, Pinga looked the exact same as Pen-Pen, except for a different model of air conditioner on her back, and a small flower brooch on her head (even female penguins had to accessorize, I suppose).  
老实说，Pinga 看起来和 Pen-Pen 一模一样，除了背上装着不同型号的空调，以及头上别着一个小小的花朵胸针（我想，即使是雌性企鹅也得打扮一下吧）。

Pinga and Pen-Pen looked at each other, blinking slightly. I wasn't sure how this whole date would work. What did penguins do on dates? I wasn't even sure that Pinga would like Pen-Pen – him being the first and only warm-water penguins in the world.  
Pinga 和 Pen-Pen 互相看着对方，微微眨眼。我不确定这场约会会如何进行。企鹅约会时会做什么呢？我甚至不确定 Pinga 是否会喜欢 Pen-Pen——他是世界上第一只也是唯一一只温水企鹅。

First, Pen-Pen bowed in front of her – very, very slowly. They made eye contact, neither blinking. Pinga did the same. I suppose this was the moment where they would just know if it was love. Nothing happened.  
首先，Pen-Pen 在她面前缓缓鞠了一躬。他们目光相交，都没有眨眼。Pinga 也做了同样的动作。我想这就是他们能感受到是否是真爱的时刻。但什么也没发生。

Still nothing. 依旧毫无动静。

Misato chuckled nervously.  
美里紧张地轻笑了一声。

Asuka, still fuming at her forced proximity to me, refused to pay attention to any of us.  
明日香，仍然对我被迫接近她感到愤怒，拒绝理睬我们中的任何人。

Pinga's owner frowned. 平加的主人皱起了眉头。

And suddenly they both started warking to each other excitedly. It was exciting, in a way – seeing two individuals meeting for the first time. We gave them some distance, watching them interact from far away. Misato struck up a conversation with Pinga's owner, which left me and Asuka to ourselves.  
突然间，他们俩兴奋地互相吠叫起来。这种情景在某种程度上很令人兴奋——看到两个初次见面的个体相遇。我们给他们留出了一些空间，远远地观察他们的互动。美里和平加的主人聊了起来，这让我们和明日香有了独处的机会。

"Look," I said, "we're probably going to be here for a while, so why don't we sort things out?"  
“看，”我说，“我们可能要在这里待上一阵子，不如我们先理清一下情况？”

Asuka didn't reply, instead choosing to go sit on a nearby bench. When I sat on the opposite end, she gave me a withering look and decided that my distance was acceptable.  
明日香没有回答，而是选择去坐在附近的长椅上。当我坐在对面时，她给了我一个冷漠的眼神，并认为我的距离是可以接受的。

Inwardly, I was annoyed. I had spent the entire day thinking about Asuka instead of Nami. Instead of leaping at the chance to be with a great, beautiful, smart, charming girl, I had chosen the one that currently wouldn't even look at me.  
内心深处，我感到烦躁。我一整天都在想着明日香而不是娜美。我没有抓住机会去陪伴一个优秀、美丽、聪明、迷人的女孩，而是选择了那个现在甚至不愿看我一眼的人。

But that's the way we are, I realized. Like Misato had said, from the moment I had met Asuka, I knew that there was _something_ that could, and would work out. Nami had made a great impression, but impressions only did so much.  
但这就是我们的相处方式，我意识到。就像美里所说的，从我遇见明日香的那一刻起，我就知道有些事情能够，并且将会解决。娜美留下了深刻的印象，但印象终究有限。

"I'm not calling her," I told Asuka's back. "When you asked me that yesterday, I really hadn't thought about going on another date. Toji and Kensuke told me to, but it wouldn't be right – I didn't even want to go on the first one."  
"我不会给她打电话的，"我对着明日香的后背说，"昨天你问我的时候，我真的没想过再去约会。真治和健介是劝我去，但那样不对——我连第一次都不想去。"

And here came the bombshell. If I was going to back out, it would have to be now.  
这时重磅炸弹来了。如果我要退出，现在就得说。

"I like you," I declared. It was funny how three simple words could change the whole nature of a relationship. The words hung in the air, as we both realized the gravity of what I had just said.  
"我喜欢你，"我宣布。有趣的是，三个简单的字眼就能彻底改变一段关系的本质。这些话悬在空中，我们都意识到我刚刚说的话有多重要。

"I can only do so much to convince you that it's true," I continued. My breath was shaky as I spoke. The words came out in a stream – I spoke faster and faster as my nerve ran out. "I can't promise that I'll never screw up or hurt you; but that I'll never intentionally do so. I do care for you. And I hope you do too."  
"我只能尽力说服你这是真的，"我继续说。我的呼吸颤抖着，话语如流水般倾泻而出——我越说越快，勇气逐渐消散。"我不能保证永远不会搞砸或伤害你；但我绝不会故意这么做。我确实在乎你。我希望你也是。"

Asuka finally turned to look at me – her eyes glistened a bit, but no tears were visible. She gave me a feeble smile.  
明日香终于转过来看着我——她的眼睛微微闪烁，但并未流泪。她给了我一个虚弱的微笑。

"You idiot," she hissed, "You're doing this _here_?"  
"你这个笨蛋，"她低声说，"你在这里做这种事？"

"It seemed like a good time," I smiled back.  
"看起来是个好时机，" 我微笑着回应。

She edged over to where I sat on the bench, until we were right next to each other.  
她慢慢挪到我坐在长椅上的位置，直到我们紧挨着彼此。

"Did you really mean what you said?" Asuka cautiously asked, as if everything between us was fragile. I nodded slightly. It was around sunset again, and the fading light behind her body played off her red hair and gave her a soft glow, complementing her beauty.  
"你真的那么想吗？" 明日香小心翼翼地问，仿佛我们之间的一切都脆弱易碎。我微微点头。又是一个日落时分，她身后渐暗的光线映照在她红色的头发上，为她增添了一层柔和的光晕，更衬托出她的美丽。

"Good," she said, and pulled me in closer, her head inching forward slowly. A bit of an awkward motion, but it made her intentions clear. She brushed aside a strand of hair in front of her mouth as she came closer. Just before our lips touched, we paused for a heartbeat, both of us just a bit scared to take the next step.  
“好，”她说着，将我拉得更近，头缓缓向前倾。动作略显笨拙，但她的意图已十分明显。她靠近时，轻轻拨开嘴前的一缕发丝。就在我们的唇即将相触之际，我们停顿了一瞬，彼此都有些害怕迈出下一步。

What the hell, I thought, and closed the gap.  
管他呢，我心想，随即闭上了眼，缩短了距离。

Unlike our first kiss in the apartment, I had access to air this time. I'd like to think that this time, it was a much better kiss.  
与我们在公寓里的初吻不同，这次我有呼吸的空间。我愿意相信，这一次，吻得更加美好。

**A/N: Additional disclaimer – I do not own Craigslist, nor do I think that there is an erotic section for penguins. At least I hope not.  
作者注：额外免责声明——我不拥有 Craigslist，也不认为有企鹅的色情版块。至少我希望没有。**

**This hung around my desktop for about a month and a half, slowly edging towards completion. The story was fun to write, even if I wrote in small, small chunks at a time.  
这篇文在我的桌面上徘徊了大约一个半月，慢慢接近完成。故事写起来很有趣，尽管我是以非常小的片段一点点写成的。**

**For those of you who don't know who Mana Kirishima is – she's a character in the game Girlfriend of Steel, an early Evangelion game which had Shinji dating a transfer student who turns out to have a dark secret. You can find fan-translated versions floating around on the internet pretty easily.  
对于那些不知道 Mana Kirishima 是谁的人——她是游戏《钢铁女友》中的角色，这是一款早期的 EVA 游戏，讲述了真嗣与一位转学生约会，而她实际上有一个黑暗的秘密。你可以在网上相当容易地找到粉丝翻译的版本。**

**Originally, I wasn't going to involve the Girlfriend of Steel plotline, but when you write about Shinji's love life in detail and his thoughts, it seems weird to leave out the only girl he's ever gone out with. Plus, as I was writing, I realized that the "Shinji gets a girlfriend" plot was pretty damn similar to the game, not by intention, but by design.  
原本我并不打算涉及《钢铁女友》的剧情线，但当你详细描写真嗣的爱情生活和他的想法时，忽略他唯一交往过的女孩似乎显得很奇怪。此外，在写作过程中，我意识到“真嗣交女朋友”的情节与游戏相当相似，并非有意为之，而是设计上的巧合。**

**Asuka might seem a bit out of character, but I emphasised Asuka's jealousy a bit more based on her actions towards Mana (play the game, and you'll see what I mean). And as for Shinji growing more of a spine and being a bit more articulate towards his thoughts… I imagined that his growing affinity with girls and feelings helped in that regard.  
明日香可能看起来有些不符合角色性格，但我根据她对真奈（玩游戏你就明白了）的行动，更加强调了她的嫉妒心。至于真嗣变得更加有主见，并且能更清晰地表达自己的想法……我想象着他对女孩们的亲近和感情的加深在这方面有所帮助。**

**To anyone who thinks I hate Rei, which I wouldn't blame you for thinking, I don't – it's just she didn't particularly fit in that much to the story, although I did try to do her justice in the few scenes I used her in. The truth is that in many a Shinji/Asuka fic, Rei usually becomes either extraneous to the story (to some extent), or a foil for Asuka to call her a doll and get jealous. I just don't want to bash Rei, or use her for the sake of using her.  
对于那些认为我讨厌绫波的人，我不会责怪你们这么想，但我并不讨厌她——只是她在这个故事中并没有特别适合的位置，尽管我在使用她的少数场景中尽力做到公正。事实上，在很多真嗣/明日香的故事中，绫波通常要么变得对故事无关紧要（在某种程度上），要么成为明日香称她为玩偶并产生嫉妒的衬托。我只是不想贬低绫波，或者仅仅为了使用她而使用她。**

**As always, comments and criticisms are welcome.  
一如既往，欢迎评论和建议。**

### Comment
[Some1Else](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/202165/Some1Else): 
This was decent. I thought this was going to be centered on Pen Pen. Shinji must have been feeling better than usual to exert the level of confidence he displayed in this story. I liked the narrative. It was a little more refreshing than it is in other stories told in the first person perspective. Asuka is more trouble than she's worth, but you made the pairing work quite well for the purpose of this fic. Great characterization and such.  
这篇写得不错。我原以为会是以 Pen Pen 为中心的故事。真嗣一定是感觉比平时好多了，才能展现出故事中那种自信。我喜欢这种叙述方式，比其他第一人称视角的故事要清新一些。明日香带来的麻烦比她的价值多，但你让这对组合在这篇同人文中表现得相当好。人物刻画得很棒。  
  
The best part of the story had to be where Shinji was wondering if he had been stood up. Aside from that, Asuka's unpredictable behavior was fun to watch. It's a shame that the review count for this story is so low when it's so easy to read.  
故事中最精彩的部分莫过于真嗣怀疑自己是否被放了鸽子。除此之外，明日香那难以预测的行为也颇为有趣。可惜这篇故事的评论数量如此之少，明明读起来如此轻松。  
  
Good work. 做得不错。

[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C):
This story was likable enough to read all the way through, so kudos on there are certain things about it that stop me from taking it seriously.  
这篇故事足够讨人喜欢，让人一口气读完，但有些地方让我无法认真对待，值得称赞。  
  
Like using the phrase "how come" as opposed to "why". Stuff like that annoys me a bit, though it's not a deal breaker.  
比如使用“how come”而不是“why”这样的表达方式。虽然有点烦人，但还不至于让人放弃阅读。  
  
Also Shinji's characterization was off in parts. Him planning a picnic for Asuka is off the mark as he is quite possibly the least pro-active character in existence. Well, maybe not... but he isn't likely to make such a bold move unless he was sure it would work. My main problem with this characterization is that earlier in the story you show him agonizing over what to do on a date, but then suddenly he becomes much smoother when he's with Asuka. It's kind of inconsistent, even if you say the date gave him a bit more confidence.  
此外，部分情节中真嗣的性格刻画有些偏差。他计划为明日香准备野餐的举动不太符合他的性格，因为他可能是所有角色中最不主动的一个。嗯，也许不是最不主动的，但他不太可能做出如此大胆的举动，除非他确信这会成功。我对这种性格刻画的主要问题是，在故事的前面部分，你展示了他为约会该做什么而苦恼，但突然间，当他与明日香在一起时，他变得圆滑多了。这种转变有些不一致，即使你说约会给了他一些信心。  
  
In any case I liked the story for the most part. Nothing too outlandishly original here, but still a fun read.  
无论如何，我大部分时间都喜欢这个故事。这里没有什么太过离奇的创新，但仍然是一段有趣的阅读体验。
