**Chapter 1: Lunch Time 第一章：午餐时间**

It's a warm summer day at the 1st Munipal Jr. High School of Tokyo-3. It's also a boring day filled with algebra and long, droning recounts of events before, during, and after the almost fabled and tragic 'Second Impact'. The Second Impact was a catastrophic global event that struck on Spetember of 2000. The cause was named as a meteor that struck Antartica with such force that most of the continent melted. The water caused massive tidal waves all over the world and killing over two billion. Another billion died in the aftermath. Only those in the goverment organization NERV know the true cause was a powerful creature called, Adam, the first Angel.  
这是东京第三市立初级中学一个温暖的夏日。这一天同样充满了代数课和冗长乏味的关于'第二次冲击'前、中、后事件的讲述。第二次冲击是一场发生在 2000 年 9 月的灾难性全球事件。其原因被归咎于一颗撞击南极洲的陨石，其威力之大导致大部分南极洲融化。由此引发的水灾在全球范围内造成了巨大的海啸，导致超过二十亿人丧生。后续又有十亿人在灾难后死亡。只有政府组织 NERV 知道真正的原因是一个名为亚当的强大生物，即第一使徒。

The sun beams with a warm glow over all who have come outside to enjoy their lunches. Girls gather in their flocks to gossip and giggle, boys herd to laugh and joke, and young couples look for nice seats in the shade to be alone together.  
阳光带着温暖的辉光洒在所有外出享用午餐的人们身上。女孩们聚成一群群，叽叽喳喳地闲聊和嬉笑，男孩们则聚在一起大笑和开玩笑，而年轻的情侣们则在树荫下寻找舒适的座位，以便独处。

High above all this activity on the roof of the school a small eccentric group gathers on the roof of the school. Asuka and Hikari sit in a small group of two. Shinji, Kensuke, and Touji sit in another. Rei sits by herself somewhere in the middle. Her quiet disposition would allow her to go unnoticed by anyone if it wasn't for her light blue hair and still, crimson eyes. None of them are too far away from each other. A conversation could easily take place between the whole if a topic presented itself.  
在学校的屋顶上，远离下面的一切喧嚣，一小群性格古怪的学生聚集在一起。明日香和光坐在一起，形成了一个两人的小团体。真嗣、健介和东治坐在另一边。零则独自坐在中间的某个位置。她那沉静的气质本可以让她不被任何人注意到，如果不是因为她那淡蓝色的头发和静止的绯红眼睛。他们彼此之间并不遥远，只要有话题出现，整个群体间便能轻松展开对话。

"Oh, I am starved!" says the fiery, German Asuka Langely Soryu. Her long, golden-red hair seems to glow in the sun. Blue eyes match the sky. She opens her bento box. "What!" Asuka vents. Her excited expression quickly turns to disappointment. She glares over to the target of this frustration. A meek, brown haired boy. He laughs with his friends. No idea mentally Asuka has marked him. "Shinji, damn it! It's your turn to cook our lunches this week. What is this stuff? Peanut butter and jelly. Sausage octopus!". Asuka yells at Shinji Ikari, who is a short distance away. Shinji looks apologetic, and Touji looks to Hikari, the class representative, with praise.  
“哦，我饿坏了！”德国血统的火爆少女惣流·明日香·兰格雷说道。她那长长的金红色头发在阳光下似乎闪耀着光芒，蓝色的眼睛与天空相映成趣。她打开便当盒，“什么！”明日香怒气冲冲地说道，兴奋的表情迅速转为失望。她怒视着那个让她感到沮丧的目标——一个温顺的棕发男孩。他和朋友们一起笑着，完全没有意识到明日香已经将他记在了心里。“真嗣，该死！这周轮到你给我们准备午餐了。这是什么东西？花生酱和果冻。还有章鱼香肠！”明日香对着不远处的真嗣·伊卡里大喊。真嗣看起来很抱歉，而东治则向班长光投去赞赏的目光。

"Hey, Class Rep. Thanks, everything tastes great." says a grateful Touji Suzuhara to Hikari, and cutting off Asuka. Hikari has been making Touji bento lunches. Disguised as a sheer act of convenience to prevent food from going to waist. In reality it's Hikari's expression of her crush over the crass, but kind hearted jock. She is a sweet, innocent, and freckled girl, but can be overbearing when it comes to the rules. Her uniform kept in perfect order. Her medium length brown hair is held in loose pigtails.  
"嘿，班长。谢谢，每样都很好吃。" 感激的铃原冬二对光说道，打断了明日香的话。光一直在为冬二准备便当午餐。表面上看似为了防止食物浪费的便利之举，实则是光对这位粗鲁却心地善良的运动健将的暗恋表达。她是个甜美、纯真且带有雀斑的女孩，但在规则方面有时会显得过于强势。她的校服总是保持得一丝不苟，中长的棕色头发松散地扎成双马尾。

Touji has the appearance of a dark haired 'tough guy'. He is the only boy who doesn't dress in the uniform of white shirt and black slacks. He instead chooses to where a dark, relaxed athletic suit.  
冬二有着一头黑发，外表像个硬汉。他是唯一一个不穿白色衬衫和黑色西裤制服的男生，而是选择穿着一套深色、宽松的运动服。

Hikari blushes softly saying, "Your welcome.".  
光轻轻地脸红着说："不客气。"

The detached, blue haired Rei eats silently. She sits still and oblivious to the rush of teenage hormones surrounding her. Kensuke Aida takes large mouthfuls of his burger. He has freckles, sandy hair, and glasses. His deep obsession is for all things war, and filming anything with his trusty digital camera. No matter how mundane it may be.  
蓝发的绫波丽静静地吃着东西，她坐在那里，对周围涌动的青春荷尔蒙浑然不觉。相田剑介大口吃着汉堡，他有着雀斑、沙色头发和眼镜。他对战争的一切有着深深的痴迷，用他那可靠的数码相机拍摄任何事物，无论多么平凡。

"I'm sorry." says Shinji. "With making dinner and school work I didn't have time to make anything fancy." This verbal bashing from Asuka really comes as no great surprise. It has pretty much becomes a daily routine for Shinji. The topic may be new, but the treatment is the same.  
“对不起。”真嗣说道，“既要准备晚餐又要做作业，我没时间做些花哨的东西。”来自明日香的言语攻击对真嗣来说并不意外，这几乎已经成了真嗣的日常。话题可能是新的，但待遇一如既往。

Touji looking disgusted with Asuka and Shinji. Asuka for verbally abusing his friend, and Shinji for always putting up with it. Touji at times believes that Shinji must be housebroken from being so naturally accommodating and living with Asuka under the care of their guardian, Major Misato Katsuragi.  
东治对明日香和真嗣感到厌恶。厌恶明日香对朋友的言语侮辱，以及真嗣总是忍受这一切。东治有时认为，真嗣一定是因为过于顺从而被驯服了，他和明日香在监护人葛城美里少校的照顾下共同生活。

Frustrated with Shinji's explanation Asuka sits back "I can't believe the stuff I have to put up with." Asuka takes a bite of the sandwich. The flavor hits her and she looks surprised.  
对真嗣的解释感到沮丧，明日香坐回原位，"我真不敢相信我得忍受这些。" 明日香咬了一口三明治。味道冲击着她的味蕾，她显得很惊讶。

Hikari notices the calm confusion on her friend. "Is something wrong, Asuka?"  
光注意到她朋友脸上的平静困惑。"怎么了，明日香？"

Asuka leans in, put up her hand to shield her talking mouth from view, and whispers, "I don't get it. Shinji can be the biggest dork, but somehow can make a simple PB&J taste so good." Curiosity gets the best of her. She looks to Shinji. He's chuckling as Touji seems to chastise him for not standing up to Asuka more. She uses her sweetest tone to address Shinji. "Shinji? So what did you put in this food?"  
明日香凑近，用手遮住嘴，低声说："我不明白。真嗣平时那么呆，但怎么就能把简单的花生酱果酱三明治做得这么好吃。" 好奇心驱使着她。她看向真嗣，他正笑着，而东治似乎在责备他没有更多地反抗明日香。她用最甜美的语气向真嗣发问："真嗣？你在这食物里放了什么？"

"Sorry Asuka. It's a trade secret." says Shinji smiling. The talk he's been having with Touji seems to of had some effect on his confidence. Touji laughing to himself as Asuka pouts.  
"抱歉，明日香。这是商业秘密。" 真嗣微笑着说。他与东治的谈话似乎增强了他的自信。东治在一旁偷笑，而明日香则撅起了嘴。

"Meanie." says Asuka. Crushed her charms have failed, and a blow to her pride. Nothing is as annoying as a desired secret being kept from you. Frustration soon changes to confusion as she hears Hikari starts to giggle softly to herself. Curiosity has claimed Asuka attention again, and she looks to her best friend. "And what are you all giggly about?"  
"小气鬼。" 明日香说。她的魅力未能奏效，自尊心受到了打击。没有什么比想要知道的秘密被隐瞒更令人恼火的了。随着她听到光开始轻声窃笑，她的挫败感很快变成了困惑。好奇心再次吸引了明日香的注意，她转向她的好友。"你在笑什么呢？"

Hikari seems reluctant to share her thoughts. "Well. What if - the secret ingredient Shinji put in - was - LOVE?" She blushes looking to Asuka for her friends reaction to her theory.  
光似乎不太愿意分享她的想法。"嗯，如果——真嗣放进去的秘密成分是——爱呢？" 她脸红着看向明日香，期待着朋友的反应。

The thought scatters through Asuka's brain. She blushes innocently for a second, realizing Hikari is watching she changes her emotions, and jaw drops. "Hikari! How could that stupid idiot know anything about love? What a laugh." Asuka raves defensively. Shinji looks on silently as Asuka rants hearing every word. Rei just eats unfazed by the outburst. It's none of her concern nor is that surprising. "That's it!" says Asuka standing dramatically, pigtails blowing in the wind, and points her finger to Shinji. "Shinji, next week I'm cooking lunch! I'm gonna show you how it should be done." This dramatic proclamation even catches the attentions of Rei.  
这个念头在明日香的脑海中一闪而过。她无辜地脸红了一秒，意识到光在看她，便立刻调整情绪，下巴一掉。“光！那个笨蛋怎么可能懂什么是爱？真是笑死人了。”明日香激烈地为自己辩护。真嗣静静地看着明日香发泄，听到了每一个字。零则是不为所动地继续吃饭，这场爆发与她无关，也不足为奇。“就这样定了！”明日香戏剧性地站起来，双马尾随风飘扬，指向真嗣说：“真嗣，下周我来做饭！我要让你看看应该怎么做。”这个戏剧性的宣言甚至引起了零的注意。

Shinji looks to his agitated friend, and room mate thinking, "_It's your turn any ways_?"  
真嗣看着他那激动的室友，心想：“反正也该轮到你了？”

Asuka sits huffing. She continues to eat her modest, but well prepared meal. Her pride would probably encourage her not to finish if she wasn't so hungry. She is that stubborn. Hikari tingles all over with excitement as she looks to Asuka and says, "Asuka, you're going to cook? Want some help? I know some great recipes."  
明日香气呼呼地坐下。她继续吃着自己那份虽简单却精心准备的饭菜。如果不是饿极了，她的骄傲可能真会让她吃不完。她就是这么倔强。光全身都兴奋得发抖，她看着明日香说：“明日香，你要做饭吗？需要帮忙吗？我知道一些很棒的食谱。”

Asuka smiles for the kind offer, but says with confidence. "Thanks Hikari, but no thanks. I'm gonna show that loser how it should be done all by myself." She waves her pointing finger to Shinji.  
明日香对这份好意报以微笑，但自信地说道：“谢谢你，光，但还是不用了。我要让那个笨蛋看看，应该怎么做，我一个人就能搞定。”她向真嗣摇了摇手指。

Several days and a few more lunch times pass. The meals Shinji prepares over the rest of the school week range from a variety of humble meals. Each have an enjoyable flavor. This however is almost like some sort of bizarre torture for Asuka. Shinji still refuses to give away the secret to his skill in cooking. His friends have been making it a daily ritual to remind him to keep his formula to himself. They don't tell Shinji that this is not for his sake, but for their own entertainment watching Asuka's blood pressure climb from being denied. Pride gets the best of her, and she stops asking after the third day. Though the question still remains bouncing around in her head. In her free time she flips through magazines. Clipping and scanning recipes she finds. She is confused as she reads through the instructions, but confident none the less. In her mind if that idiot Shinji can pull this off it should be nothing for her.  
几天过去了，又过了几个午餐时间。真嗣在接下来的一周学校时间里准备的饭菜种类繁多，虽然简单却美味。然而，这对明日香来说几乎像是一种奇怪的折磨。真嗣仍然拒绝透露他烹饪技巧的秘密。他的朋友们已经养成了一种日常习惯，每天提醒他保守自己的配方。他们没有告诉真嗣，这并不是为了他，而是为了他们自己的娱乐，看着明日香因为被拒绝而血压上升。骄傲最终占据了上风，她在第三天后停止了询问。尽管这个问题仍然在她脑海中回荡。在她空闲的时候，她翻阅杂志，剪辑和扫描她找到的食谱。她阅读说明时感到困惑，但仍然充满信心。在她看来，如果那个笨蛋真嗣能做到，对她来说应该不成问题。

In an apartment complex on the outskirts of Tokyo-3 sits Misato Kaysuragi. Misato is watching tv in her apartment and surrounded by several empty beer cans. Her pet Pen-Pen, the warm water penguin, sits by her side. Misato is a stunning, beautiful woman in her late twenties with long, dark purple hair. She is energetic and has a strong work ethic as the head tactician for NERV, the only organization in the world that was designed specifically to defend against the Angels. Her conduct at work is in sharp contrast to her home life. Her place would be a total mess on it's best day if Shinji didn't clean up after her. She has quickly become his surrogate family. Shinji sits at the table close by. He looks from his laptop to his reference guides as he does his school work.  
在东京-3 郊区的一座公寓楼里，坐着葛城美里。美里正在她的公寓里看电视，周围散落着几个空啤酒罐。她的宠物，温水企鹅 Pen-Pen，坐在她旁边。美里是一位迷人的美女，二十八九岁，拥有一头深紫色的长发。她精力充沛，作为 NERV 的首席战术家，拥有强烈的工作责任感，NERV 是世界上唯一一个专门设计来防御使徒的组织。她在工作中的表现与她的家庭生活形成了鲜明对比。如果没有真嗣帮她打扫，她家在最好的时候也会是一团糟。她很快就成了他的代理家人。真嗣坐在附近的桌子旁。他一边看着笔记本电脑，一边查阅参考书做着学校的作业。

The Sunday before the new school week has come and as night falls Asuka busies herself in the kitchen. A large racket of bashing pots, buzzing kitchen tools, chopping knives, and a slue of German curses can be heard.  
新学期的前一个周日来临，夜幕降临时，明日香在厨房里忙碌着。厨房里传来敲打锅碗瓢盆、嗡嗡作响的厨具、切菜刀的声音，还有一连串的德语咒骂。

Hearing the clamor Misato leans looking into the kitchen and calls out, "Asuka what are you doing in there?"  
听到喧闹声，美里探头望向厨房，大声问道：“明日香，你在里面做什么呢？”

Asuka simply replies, "Cooking.".  
明日香只是简单地回答：“做饭。”

Silently scoffing Misato thinks to herself, _"Sound more like she's tearing the place apart."_. She doesn't have the guts to say this out loud. She's far too smart to go ticking off an emotional girl who is surrounded by sharp cutlery. It's also a bit hard for Misato to blame Asuka though. Her attempts at the culinary arts have sounded about the same.  
心里暗自嘲笑的美里想道：“听起来更像是在拆家。”她没胆量大声说出来。她太聪明了，不会去惹一个情绪化的女孩，尤其当她周围都是锋利的刀具。不过，美里也很难责怪明日香。她尝试烹饪的声音听起来也差不多。

Shinji looks up from his studies and to the kitchen, "Asuka, do you need a hand with-".  
真嗣从学习中抬起头，望向厨房：“明日香，你需要帮忙吗——”

"No you don't!" Asuka says quickly cutting Shinji off. "You stay out of here, Dommkopf! I'm not going to let you show me up!" A kitchen object is tossed at Shinji, barely missing his head. He looks to the object after it has landed. It was just a spatula. Shinji is just glad it wasn't a rolling pin or a hot skillet. Those probably weren't in arms reach at the time.  
"不许进来！" 明日香迅速打断真嗣，"你给我待在外面，笨蛋！我不会让你看我笑话的！" 一个厨房用品朝真嗣扔去，差点砸中他的头。他看向那落地的物品，原来只是个锅铲。真嗣庆幸那不是擀面杖或热锅，当时那些东西应该不在手边。

Misato looks from Shinji, to the booming kitchen, and back to Shinji. "What's up with her?".  
美里看看真嗣，又看看砰砰作响的厨房，再回头看真嗣，"她怎么了？"

Feeling crestfallen Shinji exhales as he goes back to his school work, shrugs his shoulders, and says simply, "No idea.". Misato chuckles and she goes back to her program.  
感到沮丧的真嗣叹了口气，回到自己的学业上，耸了耸肩，简单地说："不知道。" 美里轻笑一声，继续看她的节目。

Asuka stands in the kitchen. Bowls are filled with mixtures of things and the counters are a mess. She is wearing an apron and hair pulled back in a scarf for protection. Asuka looks at her work and worries. Her desire to do a good job nags at her. She is suddenly hit with a brain storm. She glances to her side with a devilish grin. Looking at the back of Shinji's head her plan is set. He has no idea what she has planned for him. He's gonna get a great meal and love it even if she has to make him.  
明日香站在厨房里，碗中盛满了各种混合物，台面一片狼藉。她身着围裙，头发用头巾束起以作防护。明日香审视着自己的工作，忧心忡忡。她渴望做好这件事的念头不断困扰着她。突然，她灵光一闪，侧目望去，嘴角勾起一抹狡黠的笑意。看着真嗣的后脑勺，她的计划已然成形。他全然不知她为他准备了什么。即便要强迫他，她也要让他享用一顿美餐并爱上它。

It's Monday at the 1st Munipal Jr. High School. Lunch time bells ring and the students exit with their meals. Everyone goes about their rituals of separating into their normal cliques. It's a warm summer day almost exactly like the Monday before. The only exception is the delicate breeze. Much like lunch time the week before the kids sit in the same groups. Asuka had left the house when Shinji woke this morning, but met up with her on the way to school. She refused to give Shinji his bento box until he got to school. She forbid him to peak on threat of bodily harm. Shinji sits and opens the boxed lunch with perfectly prepared food. It is well filled with smoked salmon sushi, sesame seed balls, a stick of kushi dango for dessert, and other things. He is looking happy and very impressed.  
在第一市立初中，星期一的午餐铃声响起，学生们带着餐食鱼贯而出。大家按照惯例，各自归入平日的圈子。这是一个温暖的夏日，几乎与上周一别无二致，唯一的不同是那轻柔的微风。与上周一样，孩子们依旧坐在各自的群体中。今天早上，真嗣醒来时，明日香已经离家，但在上学的路上两人相遇了。她坚持要到学校才把便当盒交给真嗣，并严令禁止他偷看，否则将面临身体上的惩罚。真嗣坐下，打开那份精心准备的便当，里面装满了熏制三文鱼寿司、芝麻球、一串串的串烤团子作为甜点，以及其他美味。他看起来既高兴又十分满意。

Asuka stands by Shinji looking rather proud of herself. Sitting Shinji looks up to her. Surprised she would go through so much trouble and work for him "This looks great, Asuka." he says. Kensuke looks disappointed from Shinji's food to his vending machine hot dog, fries, and chips. Touji wouldn't want anything else then what he is already eating. He is completely happy with Hikari's cooking. Any ways he wouldn't touch anything Asuka would cook out of fear of it being laced with some form of poison.  
明日香站在真嗣旁边，显得颇为自豪。坐着的真嗣抬头看向她，惊讶于她为了他付出了这么多努力和辛劳，'这看起来真棒，明日香。'他说道。健介从真嗣的食物看向自己的自动售货机热狗、薯条和薯片，显得有些失望。而东治则对眼前的美食心满意足，他完全满意于光做的饭菜。无论如何，他绝不会碰明日香做的任何东西，生怕里面掺了某种毒药。

With her hands on her hips Asuka says, "Well, was there ever any doubt?"  
明日香双手叉腰，说道：'哦，难道还有疑问吗？'

Looking to Asuka Touji and Kensuke think in unison, "_Yes._".  
东治和健介同时看向明日香，心中暗想：'当然有。'

Rei sits quietly eating her meal. Oblivious to the drama that always seems to surround her.  
绫波静静地坐着吃她的饭。对周围似乎总是围绕着她的戏剧一无所知。

Asuka goes back to her seat next to Hikari, opens her bento box, and glances over to Shinji for his reaction to the first bite. Nervous anticipation tingles in her gut. Shinji digs into the food. He takes a bite and smiles. "It tastes really good too." says Shinji. "You did a great job, Asuka." Shinji looks over to Asuka. Expecting a grateful smile he instead sees something different. She is sticking her tongue out at him. Asuka goes back to talking with Hikari and doesn't speak to Shinji for the rest of lunch time. She feels avenged.  
明日香回到她旁边的光旁边的座位，打开她的便当盒，并向真嗣瞥了一眼，看他对第一口食物的反应。紧张的期待在她胃里翻腾。真嗣开始吃食物。他咬了一口，然后微笑着说：“味道真的很好。”真嗣看向明日香。期待着一个感激的微笑，但他看到的却是不同的表情。她正向他伸出舌头。明日香回去和光聊天，午餐时间不再和真嗣说话。她感到自己得到了报复。

Rei eats silently. 绫波默默地吃着。

The rest of the meal time is fairly uneventful. Nothing out of the norm until yelling can be heard from the school grounds below. Looking down the friends on the roof see a tall boy running from a much shorter girl. The girl chases after him screaming and tossing food. Later in the day Kensuke found out the boy is a member of the baseball team. Seems he was cheating on his girlfriend with two girls at the same time. Only reason he was caught was, because he bought all three girls the same charm, claiming it to be some rare family heirloom. The two girls confronted him during lunch and spilled the beans to his girlfriend using the charms as proof. While everyone was watching the chase on the ground. Rei took that time to finish her meal and walk back to class. Kensuke however had pulled out his camcorder and filmed the whole thing.  
用餐时间余下的部分相当平淡无奇，直到楼下校园传来喊叫声。从屋顶望去，朋友们看到一个高个子男孩正被一个矮个子女孩追赶。女孩边追边尖叫，还不断扔食物。当天晚些时候，健介得知那个男孩是棒球队的一员。原来他同时劈腿了两个女孩，而之所以被抓包，是因为他给三个女孩都买了同样的护身符，谎称是稀有的家传宝物。那两个女孩在午餐时与他当面对质，并用护身符作为证据向他的正牌女友揭露了真相。当所有人都在地面观看这场追逐时，零趁机吃完饭并返回教室。而健介则拿出摄像机，将整个事件录了下来。

The school day ended. Everyone was talking and laughing about the events during lunch. The guilty boy ran out of the building on the bell. It was rather funny seeing as all three of his pursuers were half his size. Asuka just went on a rant to Hikari about how all men were pigs. With one very special exception. Anyone who knew Asuka well enough also knew she was talking about Ryoji Kaji, Misato's ex-boyfriend from college. Currently, he was also an employee at NERV.  
放学铃声一响，那个闯祸的男孩便冲出了教学楼，而他的三个追赶者都只有他一半大小，场面颇为滑稽。大家还在谈论和嬉笑着午餐时发生的事情。明日香则对着光发泄，说所有男人都是猪，只有一个特别的例外。但凡了解明日香的人都知道，她指的是加持良治，美里大学时代的前男友，如今也在 NERV 工作。

Asuka, Hikari, Shinji, Touji, Kensuke, and Rei are walking home on the sidewalks. Asuka and Hikari are a few feet ahead, behind them is Rei, and past her is Shinji, Touji, and Kensuke. Pretty much the same groups and distances that they sit in during lunch. Asuka gossiped with Hikari, and Touji whispered to Kensuke and Shinji about how that baseball player made his mistakes. He also went into detail as to how they could do the same thing, but not get caught. Touji had to whisper in fear Asuka and Hikari would hear. Hikari Horaki is a sweet and moral girl, but she could also be venomous if given cause. This only seemed to of gotten worse when she became friends with Asuka. Kensuke was the only one who was intently listening to Touji's tips. Shinji thought it was pointless. He didn't understand why you would want to go around with other girls if you already had a girlfriend.  
明日香、光、真嗣、東治、健介和零正在人行道上走回家。明日香和光领先几步，后面跟着零，再后面是真嗣、東治和健介。基本上和他们在午餐时坐的位置和距离一样。明日香和光在闲聊八卦，而東治则低声向健介和真嗣讲述那个棒球运动员是如何犯错的。他还详细说明了如何做同样的事情而不被抓到。東治不得不低声说话，生怕明日香和光听到。光是一个甜美而有道德的女孩，但如果被激怒，她也会变得毒辣。自从她和明日香成为朋友后，这种情况似乎变得更糟了。只有健介认真地听着東治的建议。真嗣觉得这毫无意义。他不明白为什么如果你已经有了女朋友，还想要和其他女孩鬼混。

"So, Asuka." says Hikari. "Want to go to the new arcade after school tomorrow? Kodama went over the weekend with her boyfriend. She said there are a lot of really fun games." Kodama is one of Hikari's two older sisters.  
“那么，明日香，”光说，“明天放学后想去新开的游戏厅吗？小玉和她男朋友周末去了。她说那里有很多非常有趣的游戏。”小玉是光的两个姐姐之一。

"Nah." replies Asuka. "I promised Misato we would stay home and rent movies and it's my turn to pick." A sudden idea comes to her. "Want to join us?"  
"算了。" 明日香回答道，"我答应了美里我们会待在家里租电影看，而且这次轮到我选片了。" 她突然灵光一闪，"要一起来吗？"

"Sure that sounds like fun. So what kind of movies are you going to pick? Should I bring anything?" says Hikari.  
"听起来挺有趣的。那你打算选什么类型的电影？我需要带点什么吗？" 光问道。

"You don't have to bring anything. If we need something we'll just send Ikari to fetch it." says Asuka pointing her thumb back to looks to Asuka upset for her referring to him as if he was some kind of trained dog, but stays silent. A slip of paper falls from Asuka's bag. It drops on the ground and Kensuke picks it up. He was about to call after her to return the paper when the contents caught his eye. Touji leaned in to see what had his friends interest. They both have matching smiles as get the same devious idea.  
"你什么都不用带。如果需要什么，我们就让碇去跑腿。" 明日香说着，用拇指指了指身后，碇看起来有些不高兴，因为明日香把他当成了某种训练有素的狗，但他保持沉默。这时，一张纸条从明日香的包里滑落，掉在了地上，剑介捡了起来。他正要叫住她归还纸条，却被上面的内容吸引了注意力。东治凑过来看是什么引起了朋友的兴趣。两人相视一笑，同时萌生了一个狡黠的主意。

"So, Kensuke." says Touji. "That was some lunch that Asuka pulled off."  
"那么，健介。" 东治说道，"明日香做的那顿午饭真是不错。

"Yeah, real pro stuff." says Kensuke.  
""是啊，相当专业。" 健介回应道。

Asuka is walking looking rather pleased with herself. Her nose pointing a few degrees higher then normal. She is pretending not to hear even thought they are speaking louder then usual. Hikari is curious as to what they are doing as well, but follows Asuka example to appear to not to notice. Rei is walking quietly. She hears them, but has no care for their conversation. Shinji is walking a few steps ahead of his friends. He just looks to them wondering why they are talking louder.  
"明日香走着，看起来颇为自得，鼻尖比平时抬得更高了几分。她假装没听见，尽管他们的声音比平时大。光也对他们的行为感到好奇，但选择跟随明日香的榜样，装作没注意到。绫波则静静地走着，她听到了他们的谈话，却对此漠不关心。真嗣走在朋友们前面几步，只是看着他们，纳闷他们为何要大声说话。

"What do you think something like that would cost in a store?" asks Touji.  
"你觉得那样的东西在商店里会卖多少钱？" 东治问道。

"Oh, I don't know." Kensuke gives a long pause feigning deep thought and replies, "Maybe about 1560 yen."  
"哦，我不太清楚。" 健介故作深思地停顿了一会儿，然后回答，"可能大概 1560 日元吧。"

Asuka stops in her tracks as if an invisible brick wall has just jumped in front of her. "_1560 yen_" she thinks to herself. Asuka opens her school bag and starts frantically digging through. Pencils, gum, and erasers fall and hit the ground as she dredges through the books and notepads. She is unable to find whatever she was looking for. Glancing up she sees Kensuke holding the receipt. They both look like they are about to laugh.  
明日香突然停下脚步，仿佛面前突然跳出了一堵无形的砖墙。"1560 日元"，她心里默念。明日香打开书包，开始疯狂地翻找。铅笔、口香糖和橡皮擦纷纷掉落，砸在地面上，她在一堆书本和笔记本中翻找着，却找不到她要的东西。抬头一看，她发现健介正拿着收据。两人看起来都快要笑出声了。

Her hot blood flowing Asuka storm on them, grabs the receipt, and knocking them out with her school bag. Striking them about the head several times and off their feet. Even Rei has stopped walking to watch, but seems to show no real interest. Hikari gasps as she watches her friend's attack. Shinji wants to protest and defend his friends, but too afraid he would just end up taking their place.  
她的热血沸腾，明日香冲向他们，抓起收据，用书包将他们击倒。对着他们的头部猛击数次，让他们站立不稳。连绫波也停下脚步观看，但似乎并不真正感兴趣。光看着朋友的攻击，倒吸一口凉气。真嗣想要抗议并保护他的朋友，但又害怕自己会取代他们的位置。

With all her anger released Asuka upset looks to Shinji to see his reaction. Seeing if he too was part of this joke. Shinji has no reaction to what has happened. Leaning slightly backward. Prepared to make a run if he happens to be the next victim.  
怒气发泄完毕，明日香不满地看向真嗣，观察他的反应。想看看他是否也是这场玩笑的一部分。真嗣对发生的事情没有任何反应，身体微微后仰，准备逃跑，以防自己成为下一个受害者。

Asuka sees Shinji is oblivious to what is going on. "Vollidiot!" she yells passing Shinji. Asuka grunts in annoyance and storms off quickly.  
明日香发现真嗣对正在发生的事情一无所知，"笨蛋！"她大喊着从真嗣身边经过。明日香恼怒地哼了一声，迅速离开。

Hikari glances to the injured Touji. She realized what had happened once she saw the reciept, and thinks in a small way he kind of deserved it. She looks to Shinji for a second, then chases after her friend who is already a hundred feet away. "Hey Asuka wait up!"  
光瞥了一眼受伤的东治。她一看到收据就明白了发生了什么，心想在某种程度上他算是自找的。她看了一眼真嗣，然后追赶已经跑出一百多米的朋友。“嘿，明日香，等等我！”

Kensuke and Touji are out cold. Shinji just stands looking at the aftermath of Asuka's assault and completely confused. "Uh, What just happened?" Shinji ask himself out loud.  
剑介和东治都昏迷不醒。真嗣只是站在那里，望着明日香攻击后的残局，完全摸不着头脑。“呃，刚才发生了什么？”真嗣自言自语道。

Rei just walks back on her path as if nothing has happened.  
绫波只是若无其事地继续走她的路。

A/N: I never really planned on continuing this story. It was just a test of my writing. It's the first story I ever wrote. I was getting some surprising feedback. People seemed to think I could continue it. They thought I had the skill. I wasn't so sure. I thought I wrote myself in a hole. I saw this as a challenge. Over coming a challenge is fun. I really want to hear your thoughts on this new chapter.

**Chapter 2: Movie Night 第二章：电影之夜**

The breeze of the day turns to a more prominent chill at night without the sun. The street lights have been on for a few hours, and families of Tokyo-3 have sat down to their dinners. The Katsuragi apartment isn't very used to anything one would define as 'normal', but we all have to eat. Misato Katsuragi sits with her beers eating from the bowel, sitting next to her is Shinji Ikari, and across the table is Asuka Soryu. Asuka is the only one who refuses to eat with chopsticks instead opting for a spork.  
白昼的微风到了夜晚，在阳光缺席下更显寒意。东京-3 的街灯已亮起数小时，家家户户都围坐在餐桌旁享用晚餐。葛城家的公寓并不习惯所谓的‘正常’生活，但我们总得吃饭。葛城美里坐在那里，边喝啤酒边从碗里夹菜，她旁边坐着碇真嗣，对面则是惣流·明日香。明日香是唯一一个拒绝使用筷子，而选择用勺叉的人。

The meal goes by silently. Misato catches Asuka shooting Shinji short looks and just shaking her head in disbelief. Looking to Shinji he is totally unaware. Who would think that such silence could be more annoying then nails on a chalk board?  
用餐过程静悄悄的。美里注意到明日香不时向真嗣投去短暂的目光，然后摇头表示难以置信。再看向真嗣，他对此浑然不觉。谁能想到，这种沉默竟比粉笔划过黑板的声音还要令人烦躁？

Her womanly instinct tells her something happened at school today, but no way she could get a straight answer with both of them in the same room. If you want a colorful story you ask Asuka. Want the boring truth go to Shinji. The topic of work is way off. Especially after what Kaji pulled in her office. Tapping her foot in frustration. "_I hope his cheek is still red, the jerk."_ Misato thinks. Misato looks down to her bowl and it comes to her.  
她的直觉告诉她，今天在学校肯定发生了什么事，但在两人同处一室的情况下，她根本无法得到直接的答案。如果想听精彩的故事，就问明日香；想了解枯燥的真相，就找真嗣。工作的话题更是提不得，尤其是想到今天在办公室里被加持良治捉弄的那一幕。她焦躁地用脚尖敲打着地面，心想：“希望他的脸颊还是红的，那个混蛋。”美里低头看着自己的碗，突然灵光一闪。

"This tastes really good. What's in this, Shinji?" asks Misato.  
"这个味道真不错。这里面都放了些什么，真嗣？" 美里问道。

Shinji looks up from his bowl. He is caught off guard from this sudden break in silence, and with a shy smile he says, "It's just garlic pork ramen. Pork, green onions. I did use fresh ginger instead of the freeze dried."  
真嗣从碗里抬起头来。他被这突如其来的打破沉默弄得有些措手不及，带着羞涩的微笑说道："就是蒜香猪肉拉面。猪肉、葱花。我用的是新鲜姜而不是冻干的。"

Misato looks to Asuka. "What do you think, Asuka?"  
美里转向明日香。"你觉得怎么样，明日香？"

Asuka glances up from her bowl having been quiet the whole meal. Still fuming from the events during the walk home. "Yeah. It tastes alright..., Jerk." she says.  
明日香从她的碗里抬起头来，整顿饭都沉默不语。回家的路上发生的事情仍让她怒气未消。'嗯，味道还可以……，混蛋。'她说道。

"What did I do?" says Shinji.  
"我做了什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Oh, you KNOW." Asuka growled shooting him a scary look.  
"哦，你心里清楚。" 明日香咆哮着，向他投去一个可怕的眼神。

"_Well at least it's not quiet."_ thinks Misato as she silently laughs and sipping her beer. She sits back and watches them bicker as if it was some sort of live dinner theater. Shinji is honestly confused, but Asuka's pride tells her if he's too stupid to figure it out then she wont tell him.  
"至少这里不安静。" 三佐心里暗笑，啜饮着啤酒。她往后一靠，看着他们争吵，仿佛在观看一场现场晚餐剧。真嗣完全摸不着头脑，而明日香的骄傲告诉她，如果他笨到猜不出来，那她也不会告诉他。

The room goes silent with a scared, confused Shinji and a fuming Asuka. Misato's plan to get them talking seems to of backfired and now they seem to want to talk even less.  
房间陷入了沉默，真嗣感到害怕和困惑，而明日香则怒气冲冲。三佐让他们交流的计划似乎适得其反，现在他们似乎更不想说话了。

Misato looks back on how Shinji has grown since she first met him. So shy. He'd do pretty much anything if asked. Asuka may be a bit of a headache at times, but she challenges him. He is so much fun to tease, and watch him go all red faced and nervous.  
三佐回想起第一次见到真嗣以来的成长。他曾是那么害羞。几乎别人让他做什么，他都会去做。明日香有时可能让人头疼，但她能激励他。逗他玩，看他满脸通红、紧张兮兮的样子，真是太有趣了。

"So Asuka, tomorrow's movie night. You decided on the movie?" says Misato.  
"那么，明日香，明晚是电影之夜。你决定好要看什么电影了吗？" 美里问道。

"Yeah!" Asuka perks up. "I was thinking that old romance movie Magic Number 7."  
"嗯！" 明日香精神一振。"我在想那部老爱情片《魔法数字 7》。"

"Ohhh, I loved that movie back in college." Misato glows as she flashes back on memories of dragging a reluctant Kaji to such a sappy romance. Shinji sits in quiet worry about having to sit through something so down right 'girlie'.  
"哦，我大学时超爱那部电影。" 美里回忆起拖着不情愿的加持去看这种煽情爱情片的往事，脸上洋溢着光彩。真嗣则静静地坐在一旁，担心自己不得不忍受如此女性化的电影。

Asuka looks to Shinji's face. "You better that hide disgusted look, Stupid."  
明日香看向真嗣的脸。“你最好把那副厌恶的表情藏好，笨蛋。”

"Sorry. It's just… why that movie?" he says.  
“抱歉。只是……为什么选那部电影？”他说道。

"You have no right to complain. I had to sit through that retarded kung fu flick you picked last week, and I didn't complain." says Asuka. Truth is Asuka enjoyed the wild action. Part of the reason she picked such a corny movie is she knew it would make timid Shinji uncomfortable. She could enjoy the film and watch Shinji squirm all night.  
“你没资格抱怨。上周我不得不忍受你挑的那部弱智功夫片，我也没抱怨。”明日香说。事实上，明日香很喜欢那狂野的动作场面。她选择这样一部俗气的电影，部分原因就是知道它会让胆小的真嗣感到不适。她既能享受电影，又能整晚看着真嗣坐立不安。

"Oh Misato, I invited Hikari to join us." says Asuka.  
"哦，美里，我邀请了光加入我们。" 明日香说道。

Misato looks up from her meal. "What? Asuka, you know this is something for just the three of us." she says.  
美里从餐食中抬起头来。"什么？明日香，你知道这是我们三个人的事。" 她说道。

"I know, but I had to. Hikari wanted me to go with her to the arcade tomorrow. I had to turn her down, because of this. I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I invited her" replies Asuka and pouts. Misato huffs and looks to Shinji. "Well, since Asuka invited someone why don't you invite Suzuhara and Aida. I'll also see if Rei is interested."  
"我知道，但我不得不这么做。光想让我明天和她一起去游戏厅。我因为这事拒绝了，我不想伤她的心，所以就邀请了她。" 明日香回答道，并噘起了嘴。美里哼了一声，看向真嗣。"好吧，既然明日香邀请了人，你为什么不也邀请铃原和相田呢。我也会看看绫波是否感兴趣。"

"NO!" shouts Asuka. "Not the Stooges and Wondergirl! They'll ruin everything."  
"不！" 明日香大喊。"不要是那三个傻瓜和奇迹女孩！他们会毁了一切的。"

"Asuka you invited someone so it's only fair." says Misato pointing at Asuka with her chopsticks.  
"明日香，你既然邀请了别人，那就公平点。" 美里说着，用筷子指向明日香。

"I don't-" Asuka's protest is cut off by the phone. "Oh that might be Hikari." Asuka steps from the table, picks up her ramen bowl, and as she passes Shinji she flicks him across the head. Giggling she almost skips with each step. "Guten Tag." she says into the phone in a sweet tone. "Ah, Hikari! I was just talking about tomorr-" The rest of the conversation is cut as Asuka walks the phone into her room and closes the door.  
""我可不——" 明日香的抗议被电话铃声打断。"哦，可能是光。" 明日香从桌边起身，端起她的拉面碗，经过真嗣时，她用手指弹了一下他的头。她咯咯笑着，几乎是蹦蹦跳跳地走着。"你好。" 她用甜美的声音对着电话说。"啊，光！我正说到明——" 剩下的话随着明日香走进房间并关上门而中断。

Shinji rubs his temple. "_Why does she do that?"_ he thinks.  
真嗣揉了揉太阳穴。“她为什么要这么做？”他心想。

Misato watches Asuka disappear behind her door. _"For someone who thought the food was just 'alright' she sure didn't want to leave it behind."_ she thinks. She looks to Shinji and smiles. Now that Asuka is gone it's time to start spying. "Sooo. Anything interesting happen at school today?" she asks.  
美里看着明日香消失在她的房门后。“明明觉得食物只是‘还可以’，却一点也不想留下。”她心想。她看向真嗣，微笑着。既然明日香不在了，是时候开始监视了。“那么，今天学校有什么有趣的事吗？”她问道。

"Not much." Shinji says shrugging his shoulders. He takes a few bites of his cooking a topic does come to mind... until. "There was this thing in the courtyard during lunch. One of the baseball players was caught cheating on his girlfriend."  
“没什么。”真嗣耸了耸肩说。他吃了几口自己的料理，一个话题浮现在脑海中……直到。“午餐时，庭院里发生了件事。有个棒球队员被抓到在欺骗他的女朋友。”

"Oh, what happened?" she asked.  
"哦，发生了什么事？" 她问道。

"She chased him around throwing food at him." he says smiling. Despite the obvious reasons Shinji knew the guy was a jerk. Girls were only after him, because he was a jock and looks like a teen idol. "Touji was pretty jealous. Dating so many girls. I think it's stupid." Misato just sits quietly and lets Shinji express his thoughts. It's rare he will go on about a topic. "Why would you want to go around with some other girl if you already had a girlfriend?"  
"她追着他跑，边跑边向他扔食物。" 他笑着说。尽管有明显的原因，真嗣知道那家伙是个混蛋。女孩们只是因为他是个运动员，长得像青少年偶像才追他。"东治相当嫉妒。和那么多女孩约会。我觉得这很愚蠢。" 美里静静地坐着，让真嗣表达他的想法。他很少会就一个话题长篇大论。"如果你已经有了女朋友，为什么还要和其他女孩出去呢？"

Misato rest her cheek in her hand and gives him a glowing smile. Looking at Shinji as if he was some cute puppy. "You are sooooo cute." she says. "Some girl is going to be so lucky to catch you." Misato is already a little drunk. She reaches out and rubs his head. Petting him like a good puppy. Shinji blushes and glows like a boiled lobster. "Even cuter blushing." she says.  
美里用手撑着脸颊，对他露出灿烂的笑容。看着真嗣，仿佛他是一只可爱的小狗。"你真是太可爱了。" 她说。"哪个女孩要是能抓住你，真是太幸运了。" 美里已经有点醉了。她伸出手，揉了揉他的头，像对待一只乖巧的小狗一样抚摸他。真嗣脸红得像煮熟的龙虾，闪闪发光。"脸红的样子更可爱。" 她说。

"Stop teasing." he says with a groan.  
"别逗了。" 他呻吟着说。

Asuka peaks her head suddenly out the door and still holding the phone to her ear. "Misato." she says. "Hikari's parents say, because it's a school night she can't come over unless she spends the night.  
明日香突然从门后探出头来，手里还拿着电话。"美里。" 她说，"光里的父母说，因为是上学日，除非她过夜，否则不能过来。

"That's alright." Misato says smiling.  
"没关系。" 美里微笑着说。

"Ahhh!" Asuka squeals into the phone. "Schlaf Uber!" Asuka pauses for a second. Rolling her eyes from a question she says, "Sleep over, Hikari.". The rest of the conversation can't be heard as she closes the door and walks further into her room.  
"啊！" 明日香对着电话尖叫。"Schlaf Uber！" 她停顿了一下，翻了个白眼回答问题，"就是过夜，光。" 随着她关上门并走进房间深处，其余的对话便听不见了。

Misato and Shinji chat and finish their meals. Misato had to lead most of the conversation and try to pry more then a three word answer out of him. About this time Asuka walks out of her room quietly and places the phone back on the receiver. Shinji starts to stand and reaching for the bowls, but Misato grabs for his shoulder and eases him back down. "I'll get the dishes tonight." she says.  
美里和真嗣边聊天边吃完饭。美里不得不主导大部分对话，试图从他那里得到超过三个字的回答。这时，明日香悄悄地从房间走出来，把电话放回原位。真嗣开始站起来伸手去拿碗，但美里抓住他的肩膀，让他重新坐下。"今晚我来洗碗。" 她说。

"Can I help?" he asks. Misato stands and staggers a bit as she gathers up the dishes. She gives Shinji a playful little kiss on the cheek and a wink. Misato gathers all the dishes and takes them into the kitchen. Shinji can hear the water running in his now glowing red ears. He holds his cheek where she kissed him and looks up to see Asuka. She's just standing there. Her expression is unreadable. _"Why is she just looking right at me like that? What did I do?"_ He feels a chill pass through his spine. Like he is in the quiet before a powerful hurricane. Asuka calm mouth turns to a wicked grin. Walking around the table toward Shinji with purpose. She grabs Shinji by the ear and starts to pull him to the TV part of the room. "Come on, lets play a video game." she says. "I need a victim."  
"需要帮忙吗？"他问道。美里起身收拾碗碟，略显踉跄。她俏皮地在真嗣脸颊上轻吻一下，眨了眨眼。美里将所有碗碟收好，带进厨房。真嗣耳边泛起红晕，隐约听见流水声。他抚摸着被吻过的脸颊，抬头看见明日香。她就那样站着，表情难以捉摸。"她为何这样直勾勾地看着我？我做错了什么？"一阵寒意掠过脊背，仿佛身处强大飓风前的宁静。明日香平静的嘴角勾起邪魅的笑容，绕过餐桌，目标明确地走向真嗣。她一把揪住真嗣的耳朵，拉着他往房间的电视区走去。"来吧，我们玩个游戏。"她说，"我需要一个牺牲品。"

Misato finished with her dishes for the most part. She hears yelling and cheers coming from the apartment. Walking out she holds out her arm to steady herself against the wall. She watches the kids play one of Asuka's fighting games. With ever victory over Shinji Asuka chants and takes joy in rubbing it in his face. Misato just shakes her head and walks into her room. Her head is pounding. She removes her tank top to change for bed, but just passes out over the covers in just shorts and socks. The sounds of Asuka victories are her lull-a-bye. "_Family"_.  
美里基本上洗完了碗碟。她听到公寓里传来喊叫和欢呼声。走出去时，她伸出胳膊扶着墙稳住自己。她看着孩子们玩着明日香的一款格斗游戏。每次战胜真嗣，明日香都会欢呼，并得意地在他面前炫耀。美里只是摇了摇头，走进自己的房间。她的头很痛。她脱掉背心准备换睡衣，但最终只穿着短裤和袜子趴在床罩上睡着了。明日香胜利的声音成了她的摇篮曲。'家人'。

The games last for about an hour. Up to the round when Shinji finally defeated Asuka. Giving Shinji a nasty look she shut the game off. She said she was tired. "Better get to bed, Idiot." she said closing her bedroom door behind her. Shinji goes to his room, changes clothes, and lays down for sleep.  
游戏持续了大约一个小时。直到真嗣终于击败了明日香的那一轮。明日香恶狠狠地看了他一眼，然后关掉了游戏。她说她累了。"你最好去睡觉，笨蛋。"她说着，关上了卧室的门。真嗣回到自己的房间，换了衣服，躺下准备睡觉。

The next morning was much warmer then yesterday. The warm summer day had no cooling breeze. The huge metal city of Tokyo-3 just reflected the heat and the sun. Asuka made no attempt to hide her lunch was store bought this time. Shinji and Asuka on the walk to school stopped in front of the store. She made him wait outside. A few minutes later Asuka walked out. "Here." she said shortly shoving the boxed lunch into Shinji's chest. "Thanks." he said. She then promptly tore the receipt into little shreds and dropped the remains in the trash. She refused to speak for the rest of the walk to school. Asuka's mood changed when they finally met up with Hikari a few blocks from school. Shinji walked a few steps behind as Asuka and Hikari giggled about the fun they could have tonight. Shinji looked up and down the streets as they passed. Usually by this time they would meet up with Rei. Either she was already at school or she wasn't coming. He wanted to ask her to join this impromptu party. Odds say she would refuse, but he'd like to try. He didn't feel like asking Touji and Kensuke would be that hard of a sell if Misato was involved.  
次日清晨比昨日温暖许多。炎炎夏日，无一丝凉风。巨大的金属城市东京-3 只是反射着热浪和阳光。明日香这次毫不掩饰她的午餐是买来的。真嗣和明日香在去学校的路上停在了一家商店前。她让他等在外面。几分钟后，明日香走了出来。“给。”她简短地说着，将便当盒塞进真嗣的胸前。“谢谢。”他说。随后她迅速将收据撕成碎片，扔进了垃圾桶。她拒绝在剩下的上学路上说话。当他们终于在离学校几条街的地方遇到光时，明日香的脾气变了。真嗣跟在后面几步，看着明日香和光咯咯笑着讨论今晚可能的乐趣。真嗣抬头望望街道，他们通常这个时候会遇到丽。要么她已经到学校了，要么她今天不来。他想邀请她参加这个临时聚会。虽然她很可能会拒绝，但他还是想试试。他觉得如果美里参与的话，说服东治和剑介应该不会太难。

Later in the school day.  
当天稍晚些时候在学校。

"Wow! A movie night at Misato's place?" said Touji with great joy. Kensuke was too busy glowing with the possibility of spending the whole night lusting over the lovely Misato.  
"哇！在美里家看电影之夜？" 东治兴奋地说道。而健介则忙于沉浸在整夜都能对迷人的美里垂涎三尺的可能性中。

"Yeah Misato wanted me to invite you." said Shinji. "Judging the way Asuka was talking earlier they are going to treat it like some sort of slumber party." Shinji is suddenly drawn by his friends sudden and choking gasp.  
"是啊，美里让我邀请你们。" 真嗣说。"从明日香之前的谈话来看，她们似乎要把这当成某种睡衣派对。" 真嗣突然被朋友突如其来的窒息般的吸气声吸引。

"SLUMBER PARTY!" Touji yelled. A scary smile crosses over Touji's face and Kensuke just stands by crossing his fingers. Touji leans in to Shinji and whispers just loud enough for him and Kensuke to hear. "You mean Misato is going to be walking around the place in just some pajamas?"  
"睡衣派对！" 东治大喊。一个可怕的笑容掠过东治的脸，而健介只是站在一旁，交叉着手指。东治凑近真嗣，用足以让真嗣和健介听到的声音低语："你的意思是，美里会穿着睡衣在屋里走来走去？"

Shinji is a little confused about how gung ho his friends are. "I-I don't think so. Usually when it's this hot she sleeps in tank top and shorts." Shinji says as a matter of fact.  
真嗣对朋友们如此积极的态度感到有些困惑。“我-我不这么认为。通常这么热的时候，她会穿着背心和短裤睡觉。”真嗣以一种事实陈述的口吻说道。

Some of the class was in a panic when Kensuke and Touji suddenly fell to the ground tripping over their feet. Didn't seem like they were hurt. They both had matching grins that couldn't hide the vision of Misato walking about the apartment in a small top and tight, hugging shorts swimming in their minds.  
当健介和东治突然绊倒在地时，班上的一些人陷入了恐慌。看起来他们并没有受伤。他们俩脸上都挂着无法掩饰的笑容，脑海中浮现出美里在公寓里穿着小上衣和紧身短裤走动的画面。

Kensuke finally came back down from his silent fantasy. "What's the movie? Who's picking it?" asked Kensuke readjusting his fogged classes.  
健介终于从他的无声幻想中回过神来。“要看什么电影？谁来选？”健介问道，同时调整了一下他那起雾的眼镜。

"It's Asuka's turn." answers Shinji. "She said last night it was called Magic Number 7." Kensuke and Touji loose all expression in their face and stand silent.  
"轮到明日香了。" 真嗣回答道，"她昨晚说这叫魔法数字 7。" 健介和东治脸上的表情瞬间消失，沉默地站着。

"You mean that crappy romance movie?" says Kensuke. Touji looks like he just ate something foul. Kensuke looked like he was almost in tears. A life long dream crushed before his eyes.  
"你是说那部烂俗的爱情电影？" 健介说。东治看起来像是刚吃了什么难吃的东西。健介看起来几乎要哭出来了。一个终生的梦想在他眼前破灭了。

"Yeah." said a hopeless Shinji.  
"是的。" 真嗣绝望地说。

Upon these words Touji and Kensuke looked to each other in silent agreement. "Pass!" they say together and walk back to their desks. No guy would willingly sit through that movie if he can get out of it. Shinji isn't thrilled either with the idea about the movie. He almost wishes they would take him with them. "_Maybe I could stay with one of them tonight?"_ he thinks. "_No. Misato wouldn't like it. She really likes these get together that aren't involving life or death battles with Angels"_ Shinji looks over and sees Asuka smiling to herself in victory. She didn't want the other Stooges to show up and from the look on her face she heard them back out.  
听到这番话，东治和健介默默地交换了一个眼神，达成共识。"我们不去了！"他们异口同声地说着，走回自己的座位。没有哪个男生会心甘情愿地去看那部电影，如果可以逃避的话。真嗣对看电影的主意也并不热衷，他甚至希望他们能带上他。"或许今晚我可以跟他们中的一个待在一起？"他想。"不行，美里不会喜欢的。她真的很喜欢这种不涉及与使徒生死搏斗的聚会。"真嗣转头望去，看到明日香正得意地微笑着。她并不希望其他两个傻瓜出现，而从她脸上的表情来看，她已经听到了他们退出的消息。

The group sat up again on the roof for lunch. Asuka and Hikari sat in the shade this time. Asuka was careful to place her book bag and other items so they would take up the rest of the shaded area. The boys sat together near the railing. Asuka would glare at them if she ever heard the boys chuckle. She thought they were laughing about her foiled plot with the bento boxes. They wouldn't dare though. The pain from Asuka's assault was still fresh in their minds. Most of the talking was done by Asuka and Hikari. The boys quickly finished their lunches and went back inside to get out of the heat.  
小组再次在屋顶上坐下吃午餐。这次，明日香和光坐在了阴凉处。明日香小心翼翼地将她的书包和其他物品放置好，以便占据剩余的阴凉区域。男生们则一起坐在靠近栏杆的地方。如果明日香听到男生们窃笑，她会瞪他们一眼。她认为他们是在嘲笑她关于便当盒的失败计划。但他们不敢这么做。明日香之前的攻击带来的痛苦仍然记忆犹新。大部分的谈话都是由明日香和光完成的。男生们很快就吃完了午餐，回到室内以躲避炎热。

Later that Same Day 同一天稍晚时候

Asuka frantically ran around the apartment picking up empty beer cans and junk food wrappers. Pen-Pen was no where to be seen. If he was smart he was hiding. On the walk home Asuka even talked Shinji into cooking their lunches the next day. She reasons she would be too busy with Hikari over. "Shinji, get out here you idiot!" Asuka yelled. "Come help me clean up. Hikari will be here in another hour."  
明日香在公寓里疯狂地跑来跑去，捡起空啤酒罐和垃圾食品包装纸。企鹅片片不见踪影，如果它聪明的话，应该是在躲藏。在回家的路上，明日香甚至说服了真嗣第二天为他们准备午餐。她解释说，她会因为光来访而太忙。“真嗣，你这个笨蛋，快出来！”明日香喊道，“来帮我打扫一下，光再过一个小时就到了。”

"You invited her. Why do I need to do all the work?" Shinji says.  
"你邀请了她。为什么所有活都得我干？" 真嗣说道。

"Listen. Do you want her to come over and think we're slobs, because Misato is?" she says. "It's embarrassing. Arrrg! Where is Misato? It's her turn to cook tonight!"  
"听着，你想让她过来觉得我们邋遢，就因为美里是那样吗？" 她说道，"太丢脸了。啊！美里去哪儿了？今晚该她做饭了！"

Asuka was almost a complete nightmare till Hikari knocked on the door. Shinji was told to answer the door while Asuka finished vacuuming. Hikari bowed. Her arms were filled with an overnight bag, school uniform, pillow, sleeping bag, and her bento box. Shinji made room to let her through the door. "Dummkopf!" Asuka yelled at Shinji. "Are you blind? Be a gentleman and help her with some of that stuff." He was quick to respond and took several items from Hikari's arms. He thought Asuka was walking up to help when she started to remove objects from Hikari, but she just piled it all in Shinji's arms. With Hikari's arms free she hugged her friend. "Shinji take that stuff into my room." ordered Asuka.  
直到光敲门，明日香几乎是个噩梦。真嗣被吩咐去开门，而明日香则继续用吸尘器打扫。光鞠了一躬，她的手臂上挂满了过夜包、校服、枕头、睡袋和便当盒。真嗣腾出空间让她进门。"笨蛋！" 明日香对真嗣吼道，"你瞎了吗？有点绅士风度，帮她拿点东西。" 他迅速反应，从光的手中接过几样物品。他以为明日香会过来帮忙，但她只是把东西从光那里拿过来，全都堆在了真嗣的怀里。光的手臂一空，她便拥抱了她的朋友。"真嗣，把那些东西拿到我房间去。" 明日香命令道。

Shinji dropped the items by Asuka's bed. He was almost never in here. It smelled sweet and clean. Something was familiar and calming. Shinji did notice something odd as he looked around. This is a girls room, but there were no dolls or family picture. Made him think of his own family. He has no pictures of his mother. His father got rid of everything. "You're going through my drawers aren't you, pervert!" he hears Asuka shout. Upset by the accusation he shouts back, "I am not.". He laid Hikari's school uniform gently on the soft sheets and walked out.  
真嗣将物品放在明日香的床边。他几乎从未来过这里。房间里弥漫着甜美的清洁气息。有种熟悉而令人安心的感觉。真嗣环顾四周时，注意到了一些奇怪之处。这是女孩子的房间，却没有玩偶或家庭照片。这让他想起了自己的家庭。他没有母亲的照片。他的父亲把一切都处理掉了。“你是不是在翻我的抽屉，变态！”他听到明日香大喊。被这指控激怒，他反驳道：“我没有。”他轻轻地将光的学生制服放在柔软的床单上，然后走了出去。

Misato came home another hour later with two six packs and a couple bags of fast food, fries and a variety of burgers. Asuka and Hikari were playing video games. Shinji was sitting on the floor listening to his SDAT player. Pen-Pen had reappeared and was sitting next to Hikari. "Sorry guys work kept me late." Misato said. "Oh, hi Hikari." Misato put the bags down on the kitchen table and walked to the kitchen to put her beer in the fridge. "I saw Rei at HQ. She wont be coming. She has test to do with Ritsuko that should last most of the night. Probably wont be in school tomorrow either."  
一小时后，美里带着两箱啤酒和几袋快餐、薯条以及各种汉堡回到家。明日香和光正在玩电子游戏。真嗣坐在地板上听着他的 SDAT 播放器。企鹅 Pen-Pen 也出现了，坐在光旁边。“抱歉，伙计们，工作让我晚回来了。”美里说。“哦，嗨，光。”美里把袋子放在厨房桌上，走进厨房把啤酒放进冰箱。“我在总部看到了零。她不会来了。她要和律子进行测试，那将持续大半个晚上。可能明天也不会去学校。”

They all sat down to eat. Hikari did enjoy the fries and burgers. It was all girl talk and about how 'dreamy' the male lead was in the movie. It didn't take long for Misato to get cracking on that six pack. Hikari seemed genuinely interested in Misato and how she became the head tactician for NERV. Misato told her most of the story starting from joining the organization, and how she even met Asuka as a child when she worked for NERV's branch in Germany. She was skillful in telling the story without going into details like her whirlwind relationship with Kaji or the more vivid aspects of Asuka's childhood. Many of those even Shinji didn't know, and Asuka was grateful Misato avoided sharing.  
他们坐下来用餐，光确实喜欢薯条和汉堡。话题全是关于电影中男主角多么“梦幻”的女生闲聊。没过多久，美里就开始畅饮那六瓶啤酒。光似乎对美里如何成为 NERV 的首席战术家非常感兴趣。美里从加入组织讲起，甚至提到了她在德国 NERV 分部工作时，还是孩子时就遇到了明日香。她巧妙地讲述了这个故事，没有涉及与加持的旋风恋情或明日香童年更生动的细节。很多连真嗣都不知道，明日香感激美里没有分享这些。

"Okay." Misato said. "Let's all go change into our bed clothes and get ready for the movie." Everyone got up and the girls ran into Asuka's room. Shinji came out to see Misato standing by the TV table with her back to him. She was bending over and laying snacks and soda out over the table. A case of beer was at her side. As expected she was barely wearing anything in this heat. A loose tank top and small cut off shorts. Shinji had seen her like this many times before, but that didn't prevent him from stopping in his tracks for a second. He sat down, but couldn't draw his eyes away from Misato's matured body. He could even tell she wasn't wearing a bra. He would reach out for a soda, but missed several times. Misato was losing her patience. "Asuka, what's taking so long?"  
"好的。" 美里说道，"大家都去换上睡衣，准备看电影吧。" 大家纷纷起身，女孩们跑进了明日香的房间。真嗣走出来，看到美里背对着他站在电视柜旁，正弯腰将零食和汽水摆放在桌上。一箱啤酒放在她身旁。不出所料，在这炎热的天气里，她几乎没穿什么。一件宽松的背心和短小的热裤。真嗣以前多次见过她这副模样，但这并不妨碍他一时停下脚步。他坐了下来，却无法将目光从美里成熟的身体上移开。他甚至能看出她没穿胸罩。他伸手去拿汽水，却几次都没抓到。美里开始失去耐心。"明日香，怎么这么慢？"

"Coming." Asuka said irritated.  
"来了。" 明日香不耐烦地说道。

"Be right there." said Hikari.  
"马上到。" 绫波说道。

Shinji was shocked again as Asuka came out. He had lived here with Asuka for quite some time and he had not seen her dress like that for bed. It looked as if she had taken cue from Misato. She was wearing a tight top, belly exposed, and tight fitting boxer briefs. She didn't even have her hair pulled back into her trademarked pigtails. Hikari wasn't as provocative. She was wearing a cute and modest baby doll style nightie. She looked rather shy. This might of been the first time a boy had ever seen her in her bed clothes. Asuka shot Shinji a quick look as she came out of her room. When their eyes met he was positive Asuka was going to yell at him or call him a pervert. She just smiled and went to grab a seat next to Hikari. They both draped their blankets over their shoulders. Hikari picked Pen-Pen up and rested him in her lap. The bird looked very comfortable.  
当明日香走出来时，真嗣再次感到震惊。他和明日香在这里生活了相当长一段时间，却从未见过她这样穿睡衣。她似乎是从美里那里得到了灵感，穿着紧身上衣，露出腹部，以及紧身平角短裤。她甚至没有将头发扎成标志性的双马尾。相比之下，光子则不那么挑逗，她穿着一件可爱而保守的娃娃款睡裙，显得有些害羞。这可能是第一次有男生看到她穿睡衣的样子。明日香从房间出来时迅速瞥了真嗣一眼，当他们的目光相遇时，真嗣确信明日香会对他大喊大叫或称他为变态。然而，她只是微笑着，走到光子旁边坐下。两人都将毯子披在肩上。光子抱起企鹅彭彭，让它躺在自己腿上，那只鸟看起来非常舒适。

"Now that we're all ready let's get the movie started." said Misato. She picked up the remote and selected the to a movie film library option. The screen loaded and Misato scrolled through the films. She scrolled through the romance movies and found the movie "Magic Number 7". A parental code option appeared. Misato imputed her code and the movie began. Shinji braced himself for the emotional torture. She set down the remote and Shinji heard Misato open her first beer.  
"既然我们都准备好了，那就开始放电影吧。" 说着，美里拿起遥控器，选择了电影库选项。屏幕加载后，美里滚动浏览着影片。她翻过爱情片，找到了《魔法数字 7》。一个家长控制码选项弹了出来。美里输入了她的密码，电影随即开始。真嗣做好准备迎接情感的折磨。她放下遥控器，真嗣听到美里打开了她的第一罐啤酒。

He never saw this movie before, but it was just as insufferable as he thought it would be. Over the top romance, lot of emotion, and some brief nudity. That explained the parental code. He kept shifting his position on the floor. The girls had taken up all the seats. After the first half hour Asuka started to make demands. He would go ahead and do as asked. It was an escape from the mushy film, but a few minutes later she would have a new one. "Shinji, get the Cheesy Chips." "Get the ice cream, Idiot." "Shinji, get more tissues." "Schnell!"  
他以前从未看过这部电影，但它正如他所预料的那样难以忍受。过度的浪漫，大量的情感，以及一些短暂的裸露镜头。这解释了家长控制码的存在。他不停地在地面上变换姿势。女孩们占据了所有的座位。半小时后，明日香开始提出要求。他会照做，以此逃离那部黏糊糊的电影，但几分钟后她又会有新的要求。"真嗣，去拿芝士薯片。""去拿冰淇淋，笨蛋。""真嗣，再拿些纸巾。""快点！"

"Quit ordering him around like he was a pet." scolded Misato to Asuka.  
"别像使唤宠物一样使唤他。" 美里责备明日香道。

"But he's not even watching the movie. He could at least be of some use." Asuka retorted.  
"但他甚至都没在看电影。他至少也该有点用处吧。" 明日香反驳道。

Before Misato could scold Asuka any further Shinji stood up. "It's alright Misato." he said. Shinji returned with their request. "Thank you Ikari-Kun." said Hikari. "Yeah thanks." said Asuka.  
在美里继续责备明日香之前，真嗣站了起来。"没关系，美里。" 他说道。真嗣带着他们的请求回来了。"谢谢你，碇君。" 光说。"嗯，谢了。" 明日香也说道。

Things were pretty quiet for the next half hour. Shinji turned to the girls when he heard them all start to cry. The actors in the movie were making some deep heartfelt admissions of their love. They were yelling at each other, and sounded angry. It sounded more like an argument that they both agreed on. They were face to face when they suddenly attacked the other with their lips. Clothes went flying and a brief, tasteful love scene followed.  
接下来的半小时里，一切都很平静。当真嗣听到女孩们开始哭泣时，他转向她们。电影中的演员们正在深情地表白他们的爱意。他们互相大声喊叫，听起来很愤怒。这听起来更像是一场双方都同意的争吵。当他们突然用嘴唇攻击对方时，他们面对面站着。衣物四处飞散，随后是一段简短而得体的爱情场面。

Shinji didn't know this, but all of the girls were running this fantasy through their heads. They had place themselves in the girls part and their dream man in the role of the actor. Asuka was picturing Kaji holding her with his strong arms and admitting his deep love for her. Hikari was imagining Touji would throw caution to the wind, take her in his arms, and kiss her forever. Misato during the love scene had flashed on those years she spent with Kaji. The sex and the fun they had. Shinji was more busy checking the clock as he looked past the girls and wondering how much longer this could last. He looked to the girls. They were either crying, smiling, or both.  
真嗣并不知情，但所有女孩都在脑海中演绎着这一幻想。她们将自己代入女主角，而梦中情人则扮演男主角。明日香想象着加持用他强壮的手臂拥抱着她，深情表白。光想象着东治会不顾一切，将她拥入怀中，永远亲吻她。美里在爱情戏份中，闪回了与加持共度的那些年，那些激情与欢乐。真嗣则忙于看钟，目光越过女孩们，思索着这一切还能持续多久。他望向女孩们，她们或泪流满面，或笑容满溢，或两者兼有。

"_It's so stupid."_ he thought. "_Why do they watch these things when it just makes them upset and cry? It's all kind of upsetting. What's so enjoyable about crying?"_ His eyes came to Asuka. "_She's not crying. It looks like she wants to, but nothing's happening. She's smiling though. It's nice."_ He can't take his eyes away from her. Not her body, but her hair. "_Her hair's down. It looks nice. She looks…relaxed."_ He notices Asuka's eyes move and skillfully looks over his shoulder as if she caught him while looking back to the clock.  
"真是太蠢了。" 他心想，"为什么他们要看这些东西，明明只会让他们难过和哭泣？这一切都挺让人难受的。哭泣有什么好享受的？" 他的目光落在明日香身上。"她没有哭。看起来她很想哭，但什么也没发生。她在微笑。这很好。" 他无法将视线从她身上移开。不是她的身体，而是她的头发。"她的头发散下来了。看起来很美。她看起来……很放松。" 他注意到明日香的眼睛动了动，便巧妙地回头看了一眼，仿佛她发现了他，然后又看向时钟。

The movie ended with an equally sappy ending. Hikari was crying like a fountain. Shinji got up and walked to the kitchen. Misato dried her eyes and blew her nose. "Well, it isn't very late, but I got to get up early tomorrow so I'm going to bed." she said. "Night kids. Don't stay up too late." Misato paused in front of the phone. Part of her thought about calling Kaji. Better sense got to her and she walked into her room.  
电影以同样煽情的结局结束。光哭得像个喷泉。真嗣站起来走向厨房。美里擦干眼泪，擤了擤鼻子。"嗯，虽然还不算太晚，但我明天得早起，所以我要去睡了。" 她说。"晚安，孩子们。别睡得太晚。" 美里在电话前停顿了一下。她有一部分想给加持打电话。但理智占了上风，她走进了自己的房间。

"Come on Hikari let's go to my room." said Asuka grabbing Hikari's wrist, and several bags of her favorite chips and sodas.  
"来吧，光，我们去我的房间。" 明日香说着，抓住光的手腕，还拿了几包她最喜欢的薯片和汽水。

"Shouldn't we go help Ikari-kun with making the lunches?" said Hikari pointing to Shinji working in the kitchen.  
"我们不应该去帮碇君准备午餐吗？" 光指着在厨房忙碌的真嗣说道。

"Nah." Asuka replies. "He's fine." The two then disappeared into her room. Pen-Pen walked past Shinji and went to his bed.  
"不用了。" 明日香回答道，"他一个人能行。" 随后两人便消失在她的房间里。企鹅彭彭从真嗣身边走过，回到了自己的床上。

Shinji was nearly finished cooking when Misato came out of her room holding her head and groaning. She brushed up against Shinji as she reached for a glass of water and drank it down quickly. Her skin almost glows from perspiration and heat. "I thought it was Asuka's turn this week to cook your lunches for school."  
真嗣快要做好饭时，美里从房间里走出来，手扶着头，呻吟着。她伸手去拿一杯水，迅速喝下，经过真嗣时蹭了一下。她的皮肤因汗水和热气而微微发光。"我记得这周应该是明日香负责给你们准备学校午餐的。"

"Yeah." was Shinji's simple reply. "She asked me on the walk home if I would take her duty tonight. It made sense with Hikari over. She's spending time with her."  
"嗯。" 真嗣简单地回答道，"她在回家的路上问我今晚能否替她值班。考虑到光在这里，她想陪陪她，这很合理。"

"Why do you let her boss you around like that?" she says.  
"你为什么让她这么使唤你？" 她问道。

"She's not really." Shinji says and Misato pours another glass of water. "She's not asking me to do anything that I don't want to."  
"她其实没有。" 真嗣说，而这时美里又倒了一杯水。"她并没有要求我做任何我不愿意做的事。"

"That's not the point." she says.  
"那不是重点。" 她说道。

"But what's the point in refusing to do something that you really don't mind doing?" he says. "It also seems to make her happy when I cook. When she's happy she just seems more relaxed."  
"但拒绝做你其实并不介意做的事情，又有什么意义呢？" 他说。"而且当我做饭时，她看起来很开心。她开心的时候，整个人都显得更放松了。"

"It's about respect, Shinji." She says leaning against the counter. "A woman isn't going to respect you if you just do everything she tells you. She'll just end up walking all over you. Sometimes a woman wants her man to be more of a challenge." Shinji looks up to Misato. She seems to be implying something, but the point was completely lost on him. She chuckles at how oblivious this boy can be. She puts her hand on his shoulder. "Night. Don't stay up too late."  
"这是关于尊重，真嗣。" 她靠在柜台上说。"如果一个男人只是做女人让他做的每件事，她是不会尊重你的。她只会最终把你踩在脚下。有时候，女人希望她的男人更有挑战性。" 真嗣抬头看向美里。她似乎在暗示什么，但他完全没领会到。她对他这种迟钝感到好笑，轻笑起来。她把手放在他的肩膀上。"晚安。别熬夜太晚。"

"Goodnight." he replies as she walks to her room and clothes the door.  
"晚安。" 他回答道，看着她走向自己的房间并关上了门。

In Asuka's room the girls sat on the bed. Hikari sat with her back to Asuka. Asuka was helping Hikari with brushing the back of her hair.  
在明日香的房间里，女孩们坐在床上。光背对着明日香坐着，明日香正在帮光梳理她背后的头发。

"What were you thinking about while watching that movie?" asks Asuka.  
"看那部电影时你在想什么呢？" 明日香问道。

"W-what ever do you mean?" said Hikari.  
"你到底是什么意思？" 光问道。

"I saw you." laughed Asuka. "When they shared breakfast after 'that night'. You were thinking about that block head weren't you."  
"我看见了。" 明日香笑着说，"那天晚上之后大家一起吃早餐的时候。你当时在想那个木头脑袋，对吧。"

"ASUKA!" Hikari looks scandalized, and Asuka laughs. She turns her head back blushing.  
"明日香！" 光显得很尴尬，而明日香则笑了起来。她转过头去，脸颊泛红。

"Your almost as easy as the idiot out there." says Asuka. " I still can't say much for your taste."  
"你简直和外面的那个傻瓜一样好对付。" 阿苏卡说道，"我还是对你的品味不敢恭维。"

"Asuka, please don't." "阿苏卡，请别这样。"

"Alright, I know. It's not my business."  
"好吧，我知道了。这不关我的事。"

"I - I just wished he would look at me like that." said Hikari. Asuka could feel her friends morale slip.  
"我——我只是希望他能那样看我一眼。" 光说道。明日香能感觉到朋友的士气在下滑。

"Listen. Maybe we should try and do something different with your hair or something. Try a new style." Asuka grabs Hikari's hair and holds it as if she was styling her own hair in pigtails.  
"听着，或许我们应该试着改变一下你的发型，换个新风格。" 明日香抓起光的头发，仿佛在给自己扎双马尾一样摆弄着。

Hikari giggles and says, "Thanks for the offer, but I like my hair.". Hikari sits up and lays in her soft cushioned sleeping bag. "I don't think he would even notice something like that." She hugs her pillow. Kicking her feet are in the air. Asuka grabs a handful of chips and looks to her friend.  
光咯咯地笑了，说："谢谢你的提议，但我喜欢我的发型。" 光坐起身，躺进她那柔软的睡袋里。"我觉得他甚至不会注意到这种小事。" 她抱紧枕头，双脚在空中踢来踢去。明日香抓起一把薯片，看向她的朋友。

The room is quiet for a minute. Hikari hears the dishes as Shinji finishes his cooking. "Wasn't it your turn to cook this week?"  
房间里安静了一分钟。光听着真嗣做完饭后洗碗的声音。“这周不是该你做饭吗？”

"Yeah Shinji's taking it on tonight. No big deal. He likes doing that kind of stuff. I like his food and he likes making it."  
“是啊，真嗣今晚接手了。没什么大不了的。他喜欢做这些事。我喜欢吃他做的饭，他也喜欢做。”

"Asuka, why don't you have a boyfriend?" asks Hikari.  
"“明日香，你怎么没有男朋友呢？”光问道。

"What!" says Asuka shocked.  
"什么！" 明日香震惊地说道。

"You're so beautiful. You could have any boy in school, but the only boy I ever see you with is Shinji."  
"你这么漂亮，学校里的男生任你挑，但我只看到你和真嗣在一起。"

"We work together. So what?" Asuka lays back on her bed. "What brought all this up?"  
"我们只是工作伙伴而已。那又怎样？" 明日香躺回床上，"怎么突然提起这个？"

"I saw him... during the movie." Hikari still cuddling her pillow, but turning to look to Asuka. "He was watching you"  
"我在电影期间看到他了。" 光依然抱着她的枕头，但转头看向明日香。"他在看你"

"He was probably thinking something perverted." Asuka says nodding her head.  
"他可能想了些下流的事。" 明日香点头说道。

"His eyes were soft. He was smiling. I don't think I've ever seen him look like that." Hikari thought for a moment. "Do you like Shinji?"  
"他的眼神很温柔，他在微笑。我觉得我从未见过他那样。" 光想了一会儿。"你喜欢真嗣吗？"

"Awk!" Asuka hollered. "He's a dork! Yeah he has his uses. He can be so damn dense." She starts to tap her foot in a wild pace. "He wouldn't know what do to with a woman unless he was given a map. Only one man has my heart."  
"啊呀！" 明日香大声喊道。"他真是个呆子！虽然他也有用处。他就是这么迟钝得要命。" 她开始急促地跺脚。"除非给他一张地图，否则他根本不知道怎么对待女人。只有一个人能俘获我的心。"

"Mr. Kaji?" "加持先生？"

Asuka moans. "Yeah. He's a real man."  
明日香呻吟道："对，他才是真正的男人。"

"Shinji is nice. He's shy, but he has a kind heart."  
"真嗣人很好。他虽然害羞，但心地善良。"

"Yeah, I guess." says Asuka and the room goes quiet. Both of them lost in thought. "_He's an idiot, but I guess he's alright. I want a man...not a boy."_ she thinks."Hey Hikari."  
"嗯，我想也是。" 明日香说道，房间随即陷入沉默。两人都陷入了沉思。"他是个笨蛋，但我想他还算不错。我想要的是一个男人...不是一个男孩。" 她心想。"嘿，光。"

"What is it?" Hikari looks to Asuka and is suddenly hit in the face with a thrown soft pillow.  
"怎么了？" 光看向明日香，突然被一个扔过来的软枕头砸中了脸。

Shinji finishes up with the dishes and stretches his arms. He hears a sudden and loud giggling heard from Asuka's room. "_Their happy."_ he thinks. Shinji walks to his room. He picks up his SDAT player and listens to his music. Climbing into bed he reaches for a manga book. He reads for about an hour and lays down to sleep. He can still hear them laughing and giggling. His mind drifts into sleep and some of his memories today.  
真嗣洗完碗筷，伸展了一下手臂。突然，从明日香的房间传来一阵响亮的笑声。'他们很开心啊。'他想。真嗣走向自己的房间，拿起 SDAT 播放器，开始听音乐。爬上床，他伸手拿了一本漫画书。他读了大约一个小时，然后躺下准备睡觉。他仍能听到他们的笑声和嬉笑声。他的思绪渐渐沉入梦乡，脑海中浮现出今天的一些记忆。

That lunch. 那顿午餐。

No pictures. 没有照片。

The movie. 这部电影。

Her hair. 她的头发。

She wasn't crying. 她并没有哭。

Why wasn't she crying? 为什么她没有哭？

Like Misato said she was gone when everyone woke up. No one heard her leave. Must have been really early. Shinji woke up slowly. The thoughts he had just before falling into sleep were gone. Like a deep dream that slips from your grasp once you have finally realized your awake. He could smell the cooking. Smelled like bacon, toast and pancakes. He stepped out of his room rubbing his eyes. They felt dry and just wouldn't focus. He saw Asuka and Hikari, still in their bed clothes, both working at the stove. Pen-Pen was busy eating up already. He could hear Hikari giving Asuka tips.  
就像美里说的，当大家醒来时她已经走了。没有人听到她离开。一定是非常早。真嗣慢慢地醒来。他入睡前的思绪已经消失。就像一个深梦，一旦你意识到自己醒了，它就从你的掌握中溜走。他能闻到烹饪的味道。闻起来像是培根、吐司和煎饼。他揉着眼睛走出房间。眼睛感觉干涩，就是无法聚焦。他看到明日香和光，还穿着睡衣，都在炉子旁忙碌。企鹅 Pen-Pen 已经在忙着吃早餐了。他可以听到光在给明日香提建议。

"Morning." Shinji said. “早上好。”真嗣说道。

Hikari turned and said, "Good morning, Ikari-kun.".  
光转身说道：“早上好，碇君。”

"Hey." Asuka said simply waving her hand up and not even turning to look.  
“嘿。”明日香简单地挥了挥手，甚至没有转过身来看。

"We woke up early and thought we would make breakfast since you made our lunches."  
“我们起得早，想着既然你帮我们准备了午餐，我们就来做早餐吧。”

"Uh, Thanks." Shinji says.  
"呃，谢谢。" 真嗣说道。

Asuka turns her head with a nasty look. "What's with that tone, Third?" she says.  
明日香转过头，面带不悦。"那是什么语气，三号？" 她说道。

"Nothing. I didn't mean-" Shinji says stumbling over his words. "Sorry." Asuka turns back to the pancakes and rolling her eyes with a huff.  
"没什么。我不是那个意思——" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，"对不起。" 明日香转回煎饼那边，翻了个白眼，哼了一声。

Shinji helps Hikari set out the plates. He pours the orange juice as Asuka and Hikari set out the food. Shinji sits across from the girls. "Asuka made the pancakes." Hikari says cheerful.  
真嗣帮光摆好盘子。他倒着橙汁，而明日香和光则在摆放食物。真嗣坐在女孩们对面。“明日香做的煎饼。”光高兴地说。

"Really?" says Shinji looking to Asuka. She doesn't respond.  
“真的吗？”真嗣看向明日香问道。她没有回应。

The first thing Shinji tries is the pancakes. Unseen by him Asuka is watching him intently. She gently bites the at the inside of her lip. She wants to see his instant reaction. He takes a bite and smiles. "It tastes great. Thanks." Shinji says to Asuka, but misses her eyes. She is looking away. "Whatever." Is her only response. "Hikari was a lot of help."  
真嗣尝试的第一样食物是煎饼。在他没注意的时候，明日香正专注地观察着他。她轻轻咬着内唇。她想看看他即刻的反应。他咬了一口，然后微笑着说：“味道真好。谢谢。”真嗣对明日香说，却没注意到她的眼神。她正看向别处。“随便吧。”她只是这么回应。“光帮了很多忙。”

Hikari looks to the both of them. Softly humming and kicking her feet. "_It's almost like the movie."_ she thinks.  
光看向他们俩，轻声哼唱着，踢着脚。“这简直就像电影一样。”她心想。

The teens eat and get ready for school. Asuka pushed Shinji into his room and told him not to come out until ordered to. The girls were going into the bath and she wanted to be positive he wasn't going to try and peak. The girls washed up and Asuka gave him the all clear once they were in her room and changing. Shinji was hardly in bath room for ten minutes. He came out, got dressed and handed the girls their lunches.  
青少年们吃完早餐，准备去学校。明日香把真嗣推进他的房间，告诉他没有命令不得出来。女孩们要去洗澡，她想确保他不会试图偷看。女孩们洗漱完毕，明日香在她们进入她的房间换衣服后给了真嗣放行的信号。真嗣在浴室里待了不到十分钟。他出来后，穿好衣服，递给女孩们她们的午餐。

"What did you make, Ikari-kun?" asked Hikari.  
“你做了什么，碇君？”光问道。

"Asuka's favorite. Eggs and sausage with noodles." answers Shinji.  
"明日香的至爱。鸡蛋香肠配面条。" 真嗣回答道。

"Thank you very much." says Hikari and looks to Asuka. Asuka just looks at her bento box. "Thanks." she says softly blushing. She just can't bring herself to insult him just now. Oh well, sure she'll come up with something later. It's early.  
"非常感谢。" 光说，并看向明日香。明日香只是盯着她的便当盒。"谢谢。" 她轻声说道，脸颊泛红。此刻她就是无法开口贬低他。算了，她肯定稍后会想出什么来的。现在还早。

The three walk out the door. Shinji walks behind them. He's pretty sure he hears Hikari mention that new arcade again and this weekend. It's warm again today, but there's a nice breeze.  
三人走出门口。真嗣跟在他们后面。他确信自己听到光再次提到那个新开的游戏厅，还有这个周末。今天又是一个暖和的日子，但有一阵宜人的微风。

"_Her hair's blowing in the wind."_ he thinks.  
"她的头发在风中飘扬。" 他心想。

A/N: Welcome to chapter three of my ongoing mini saga. Normally when I write I start on paper with small notes on how I want events in a chapter to play out. Oddly enough the defining moment in this chapter started as a simple scene of what is now going to be chapter four. It's funny how three or four sentences of notes could wind up becoming a whole chapter.  
作者的话：欢迎来到我的连载小史诗的第三章。通常我在写作时会先在纸上做些简短的笔记，规划章节中的事件如何展开。有趣的是，本章的关键时刻最初只是第四章中的一个简单场景。三到四句笔记竟能演变成一整章，实在有趣。  
You will notice that this chapter has an IM (Instant message) scene. I've seen those in a couple of fan fics and they always made for some good stuff. My original plan was to have Hikari ask Shinji during gym, but this works out so much better. Most of the time in IM scenes the sign on names always looked like they were made by a fan. I gave them these names by looking at the personality of the characters. I wanted it to look like something they would pick. I even put the thought into how they would type. I pictured Shinji and Hikari paying close attention to grammar, Rei being a simple as possible, and Asuka typing as fast as she can throwing proper grammar to the wind.  
你会发现这一章包含了一个即时消息（IM）场景。我在几篇同人小说中见过这种设定，它们总能带来不少精彩内容。我原本计划让光在体育课上询问真嗣，但现在这样安排效果更佳。在 IM 场景中，大多数时候登录名看起来都像是粉丝编的。我根据角色的性格为他们选择了这些名字，力求看起来像是他们会选择的。我甚至考虑了他们打字的方式：想象中真嗣和光会注重语法，零则尽可能简洁，而明日香则是飞速打字，完全不顾及语法规则。  
Anyone who is a fan of the manga and anime should recognize a few moments.  
任何喜欢这部漫画和动画的粉丝应该都能认出几个经典时刻。

**Chapter 3: A Tender Misdeed  
第三章：温柔的过失**

"_Sooo cold."_ he thought shivering in bed. "_Why is it so cold in here? I thought it was summer."_ Shinji clung to his covers in a fetal position on his bed. Peaking out from under his covers he looks to his clock. _"It's time to get up."_ Time to get ready for school and he was surprised how he was actually looking forward to it. Crowds of people usually made him feel a little uncomfortable, but yesterday was nice. Hikari just glowed about the lunch he prepared for them. She insisted he sit with her and Asuka so she could pick his brain about recipes. Asuka seemed a little put out that Shinji was there with them, but even she seemed to listen as he talked about some of his ingredients and preparations. Hikari appeared to be very impressed by many of Shinji's personal touches.  
“好冷啊。”他蜷缩在床上，瑟瑟发抖地想，“这里怎么这么冷？不是夏天吗？”真嗣紧紧抓住被子，以胎儿般的姿势躺在床上。他偷偷从被子下探出头，望向闹钟。“该起床了。”是时候准备去学校了，他惊讶地发现自己竟然对此有所期待。人群通常让他感到些许不适，但昨天却很美好。光对他准备的午餐赞不绝口，坚持要他坐过来，和明日香一起，以便向他讨教食谱。明日香似乎对真嗣的加入有些不悦，但即便如此，她还是听着他讲述食材和烹饪方法。光对真嗣的许多个人创意显得非常钦佩。

After lunch Touji and Kensuke asked about the night before. Mostly all they seemed to care about was what the girls were wearing as sleep wear. Asuka must of heard them ask, because before Shinji could say anything he felt a wad of paper hit him in the back of the head. Looking to it's origin he saw Asuka giving him a very evil glare that seemed to say, "_Tell them and I'll make you suffer."_. He simply answered his friends with, "Nothing special.". Shinji told them a rough over view of the movie and Touji seemed to pity Shinji. Almost looked like he wanted to hug him to console him through such a trauma. He didn't though, thankfully.  
午饭后，东治和健介询问起前一晚的情况。他们似乎最关心的是女生们穿着什么睡衣。明日香肯定是听到了他们的提问，因为还没等真嗣开口，他就感觉到一团纸砸在了后脑勺上。他朝纸团飞来的方向看去，只见明日香正用一种极其凶狠的眼神瞪着他，仿佛在说：“你要是敢说，我就让你好看。”他只好简单地回答朋友：“没什么特别的。”真嗣大致描述了一下电影内容，东治似乎对真嗣深表同情。他几乎想要拥抱真嗣，以此安慰他经历的这场创伤。不过，他最终并没有这么做，谢天谢地。

Touji and Kensuke did ask for a couple details. "So just how bad was it?" Touji asked out of morbid curiosity. "I did hear there was some decent nudity."  
东治和健介确实追问了一些细节。“那电影到底有多糟？”东治出于病态的好奇心问道。“我听说里面有些不错的裸露镜头。”

"Yeah some." Shinji answered. "Most of the movie was really sappy. Lot of the girls cried. I think Hikari was crying the most."  
“是有些。”真嗣回答，“大部分电影真的很煽情。很多女生都哭了。我觉得光哭得最厉害。”

"Girls are weird about those movies" says Kensuke. "Give me anything created by Raimi and I'm happy."  
"女孩子对那些电影的看法真奇怪。" 健介说，"给我任何雷米创作的作品，我都会很开心。"

"Yeah, it's was strange." chuckled Shinji.  
"是啊，确实挺奇怪的。" 真嗣笑着说。

"Women are just crazy that's all." says Touji. "Still Ikari you are one poor bastard to have to suffer through that." Shinji just nodded his agreement.  
"女人就是疯疯癫癫的。" 东治说，"不过，碇，你真是个可怜的家伙，得忍受那种事。" 真嗣只是点头表示同意。

Hikari walked all the way back to Misato's place with Asuka and Shinji so she could collect the things she left. Asuka insisted that they help Hikari carry all her stuff home. Which really meant Shinji was to carry everything while the girls led the way and gossiped. When they got to Hikari's home her parents were very grateful they took such care of their daughter. They invited both Shinji and Asuka in for tea.  
光一路跟着明日香和真嗣回到美里家，以便取回她留下的东西。明日香坚持要帮光把所有东西搬回家。实际上，这意味着真嗣要负责搬运所有物品，而两位女生则领路并闲聊。到达光的家时，她的父母非常感激他们如此照顾自己的女儿。他们邀请真嗣和明日香进屋喝茶。

"Thank you," Shinji said politely. "but I think we should be getting home."  
"谢谢，"真嗣礼貌地说。"但我想我们应该回家了。"

Asuka shot him a nasty look and whispered, "Don't be so rude. It's not sociable to turn down a polite offer like that." She turned to Hikari's mother, bowed, said, "Thank you very much, Mrs. Horaki.", and yanks Shinji in by the ear. "You'll have to forgive this idiot. He's not well versed in diplomatic matters." Hikari's mom was very understanding and just laughed it off.  
明日香瞪了他一眼，低声说："别这么没礼貌。拒绝这样的礼貌邀请可不社交。"她转向光的母亲，鞠了一躬，说："非常感谢，堀木太太。"然后拽着真嗣的耳朵把他拉进屋。"您得原谅这个笨蛋。他对外交事务不太在行。"光的妈妈非常理解，只是笑着把这事带过了。

Inside Shinji finally got to meet Hikari's older sisters, Kodama and Nozomi. They seemed to find Shinji's natural innocence as adorable as Misato. They sat close to him and teased him about if he had a girlfriend. Asuka was usually very polite around mixed company like this, but she seemed to glare at Hikari's sisters and cursed them under her breath.  
在内心深处，真嗣终于见到了光的两個姐姐，小田和希美。她们似乎和美里一样，觉得真嗣天真的纯真十分可爱。她们紧挨着他坐下，逗弄他，问他是否有女朋友。通常在这样混合的社交场合，明日香总是彬彬有礼，但她似乎对光的姐姐们怒目而视，并在低声咒骂她们。

Shinji and Asuka shared the small bag peanut butter and chocolate chip nano-cookies Hikari's mom gave them as they left. A gesture of thanks for escorting their daughter safely home. Shinji ate a couple, but gave the rest to Asuka. He really didn't like peanut butter that much and knew Asuka liked it a lot. She hadn't talked much on the walk home until then. She thanked him and a few minutes later asked what he thought about Hikari's sisters. "They were nice." he said. "I just don't know why they kept asking me all those personal questions."  
真嗣和明日香分享了光妈妈在他们离开时给的小袋花生酱巧克力碎片纳米饼干。这是对他们安全护送女儿回家的感谢之举。真嗣吃了几个，但把剩下的都给了明日香。他其实不太喜欢花生酱，知道明日香非常喜欢。在回家的路上，她直到那时都没怎么说话。她向他道谢，几分钟后又问他觉得光的姐姐们怎么样。“她们很友好。”他说，“我只是不明白为什么她们一直问我那么多私人问题。”

"What kind of questions?" Asuka asked.  
“什么样的問題？”明日香问道。

"Do I have a girlfriend, If I LIKE Hikari, and Kodama kept tickling my neck." he replied. "It made me a little uncomfortable." Asuka just shook her head and slugged him in the arm. "Don't be an idiot, Stupid. They thought you were dating Hikari. Gott knows you would be an improvement over that dork Suzuhara. Anyone would." she said but mumbled that last sentence. "But Hikari has her heart set on that particular Stooge. Seriously, Shinji you shouldn't let a little touching upset you." Asuka caught Shinji off guard when she slipped her arm over his shoulder. "See this isn't so bad is it?"  
"我有没有女朋友，如果我喜欢光，而木花一直在挠我的脖子。"他回答道，"这让我有点不舒服。"明日香只是摇了摇头，朝他的胳膊上捶了一拳。"别傻了，笨蛋。他们以为你在和光约会。天知道你比那个呆瓜铃原强多了。任何人都比他强。"她说着，但最后一句是小声嘀咕的。"但光的心已经放在那个特定的傻瓜身上了。说真的，真嗣，你不应该因为一点触碰就心烦意乱。"当明日香突然把手臂搭在他的肩膀上时，真嗣措手不及。"看，这没什么不好吧？"

"No…. I guess not." Shinji said and smiled. They stayed like that during the whole walk home. Shinji hadn't felt this relaxed in a very long time. When he went to bed it was very easy for him to drift to sleep. He even had another lovely dream that he wouldn't remember the next morning with the exception of the end where he was trapped in a mountain cave with some wild girl during a snow storm. Upon waking up and feeling how cold it was in the house the end of the dream started to make more sense.  
"不……我想不是。"真嗣说着，露出了微笑。他们就这样一路走回家。真嗣已经很久没有感到这么放松了。晚上睡觉时，他很容易就进入了梦乡。他甚至又做了一个美好的梦，第二天早上醒来时只记得梦的结尾，他和一个野性十足的女孩被困在山洞里，外面正下着暴风雪。醒来后，感受到屋里的寒冷，梦的结尾开始变得更有意义了。

Shinji climbed out of bed still covered in his blanket. He slides open his door and sees Misato standing at the stove in sweat pants and shirt. Pen-pen was waddling around the place looking rather comfortable. "Misato, what's with the apartment? It's freezing." he asks. Misato turns around to give an apologetic smile. "Morning. I'm sorry." Misato says. "The humidity is suppose to skyrocket today. I turned on the Central AC, but it seems to be busted through the entire apartment complex. I can't even close the vents. I called the land lord, and she said she should have someone to look at it this afternoon."  
真嗣裹着毯子从床上爬起来，拉开房门，只见美里穿着运动裤和 T 恤站在炉灶前，企鹅 Pen-pen 悠闲地在屋内摇摇摆摆。“美里，这公寓怎么回事？冷死了。”他问道。美里转过身，歉意地笑了笑：“早上好。对不起啊。”美里解释道，“今天湿度预计会飙升，我开了中央空调，但似乎整个公寓楼的空调都坏了，连通风口都关不上。我已经联系了房东，她说下午会派人来检查。”

About this time Asuka's door came sliding open. She was wearing the same kind of small outfit she was wearing the night of the movie and seemed to be regretting it. She walked out rubbing her arms to try and keep herself warm. "Verdammt noch mal!" the red head hollers. "It's like a freezer in here!" Misato gave Asuka the rundown about the problems with the ventilation. Shinji had the bad luck to choose this time to glance down and notice the biological effect the cold was having on Asuka's body. She took notice of what he was staring at and quickly covered her breasts with her hands. "YOU PERVERT!" she screams. "Can't you pigs think with something above the belt!"  
就在这时，明日香的房门滑开了。她穿着和电影之夜同样的小巧装束，似乎对此感到后悔。她走出来，搓着双臂试图让自己暖和些。‘该死！’红发少女大声抱怨，‘这里简直像冰窖一样！’美里向明日香解释了通风系统的问题。真嗣不幸地在这时低头，注意到了寒冷对明日香身体产生的生理影响。她察觉到他的目光所及，迅速用手遮住了胸部。‘你这个变态！’她尖叫道，‘你们这些猪就不能用脑子想事情吗！’

"S-s-sorry." Shinji sputters quickly looking off to spaces. "I mean I… I didn't mean to-"  
‘对……对不起。’真嗣结巴着，迅速将视线移开，‘我的意思是……我不是故意的——’

"What's going on?" asks Misato looking away from her cooking.  
‘发生了什么事？’美里问道，目光从烹饪中移开。

"It's Shinji! He was staring at me." Asuka says glaring at him. Misato glances back to the frying pan and says in response, "Then go put on something warmer."  
"是真嗣！他刚才一直盯着我。" 明日香瞪着他，说道。美里回头看了一眼煎锅，回应道："那你就去穿点暖和的衣服吧。"

"I can't." Asuka says. "All my winter and fall clothes are in storage."  
"不行。" 明日香说，"我所有的冬装和秋装都放在储藏室里了。"

"Uh, can I grab a shower first so-" Shinji started to say.  
""呃，我能先洗个澡吗，所以——" 真嗣刚开口说道。

"No." snapped Asuka as she turned on him. "It's called 'chivalry', Idiot. Ladies go first." Still covering herself she stormed into the bathroom slamming the door. "_It might help if you would acted like a lady more often."_ thought Misato as she sipped at her beer. "Uh, Shinji." Misato says embarrassed and looking to the boy. "Could you help me with breakfast? I think I burned the eggs." Shinji helped Misato and he was able to help salvage the botched cooking. He even put some green onions in the pan with some sliced ham. Warming up some tortilla shells he made breakfast burritos. Asuka walked out much calmer then she did going in, and saying that she saved him some warm water. Shinji washed up. By the time he was out Asuka was just exiting of her room, dressed for school, covered by her blanket. He went to his room and was surprised that Asuka and Misato had waited for him before they started to eat. Misato and Pen-pen saw them to the door and said, "Have a nice day kids.". They all waved their good-byes as they left.  
"不。"明日香猛地转身对他吼道，"这叫'骑士精神'，白痴。女士优先。"她依旧遮掩着身体，怒气冲冲地冲进浴室，砰地一声关上门。"你要是能更像位女士，或许会好些。"美里边喝啤酒边想。"呃，真嗣。"美里尴尬地看向男孩，"你能帮我准备早餐吗？我想我把鸡蛋煎糊了。"真嗣帮美里挽救了失败的烹饪，他甚至在平底锅里加了些葱花和火腿片。加热了一些玉米饼壳，他做了早餐卷饼。明日香出来时比进去时平静多了，还说给他留了些热水。真嗣洗漱完毕。等他出来时，明日香刚从房间出来，穿着校服，裹着毯子。他回到自己房间，惊讶地发现明日香和美里等他一起吃饭。美里和 Pen-pen 送他们到门口，说："孩子们，祝你们今天愉快。"他们互相挥手告别后离开。

The day was just as humid and muggy as Misato had warned. The weather guy was right. There's a new one. Rei was in class today. She looked a little tired and had a bandage on her right arm. All the windows were open in school to tempt a non existent breeze. Shinji was tapping his pen on his desk during the lecture when a familiar chime rang from his laptop. On his screen he saw he was sent an instant message.  
这一天正如碇真嗣所警告的那样潮湿闷热。天气预报员说得没错。又来了一个新同学。绫波今天来上课了。她看起来有些疲惫，右臂上还贴着绷带。学校的所有窗户都敞开着，试图引诱那并不存在的微风。上课时，真嗣在桌子上轻敲着笔，突然，他的笔记本电脑传来了一阵熟悉的提示音。屏幕上显示他收到了一条即时消息。

**ClassRep2-A:** Ikari-kun? 班长 2-A: 碇君？

**Shin-chan03:** Yeah? 真酱 03: 怎么了？

**ClassRep2-A:** Do you have any plans for this weekend? Sat 11:00am?  
班长 2-A：这周末有什么安排吗？周六上午 11 点？

**ClassRep2-A:** ... 二班班长：……

**ClassRep2-A:** I already talked to Asuka. She'll be coming.

**Shin-chan03:** Is that all?

小新 03：有什么问题吗？

**ClassRep2-A:** No. Sorry, Asuka is inviting me to IM. See you this weekend. )  
班长 2-A：不了，抱歉，明日香叫我一起去即时通讯。周末见。）

**Shin-chan03:** Later. 小新 03：回头聊。

**ClassRep2-A** has left the room.  
班长 2-A 已离开房间。

Shinji sits looking to his empty screen. He thinks, "_Why doesn't she want me to tell anyone?"_. He looks toward the head of the class and he sees she is typing away as she talks with Asuka via the chat network. He looks over to Rei and her bandaged arm. He types on his computer to send Rei and instant message.  
真嗣坐在那里，盯着空白的屏幕。他心想：“为什么她不让我告诉任何人？”他望向教室前方，看到她一边打字一边通过聊天网络与明日香交谈。他又看向绫波，注意到她缠着绷带的手臂。他在电脑上打字，给绫波发送了一条即时消息。

**Shin-chan03:** Rei are you there?  
真嗣酱 03：绫波，你在吗？

**ARei01** has entered the room  
ARei01 进入房间

**ARei01:** Yes Ikari. ARei01: 是的，碇。

**Shin-chan03:** Are you all right? I saw the bandage.  
Shin-chan03: 你没事吧？我看到绷带了。

**ARei01:** I'm fine. There was an accident. No one was harmed.  
ARei01: 我没事。出了点事故，没人受伤。

**Shin-chan03**: But your arm.  
Shin-chan03: 但是你的手臂。

**ARei01:** A hatch closed on my arm. It's not serious.  
ARei01: 我的手臂被舱门夹到了。不是很严重。

**Shin-chan03:** I'm glad you're all right.  
Shin-chan03: 很高兴你没事。

**ARei01:** Okay. ARei01: 好的。

**Shin-chan03:** ...

ARei 进入了房间

**ARei01:** Ikari? ARei01: 伊卡里？

**Shin-chan03:** Yes? Shin-chan03: 怎么了？

**ARei01:** Thank you. ARei01: 谢谢你。

**ARei01** has left the room.  
ARei01 已经离开了房间。

Shinji looks up from his laptop to Rei. She sits at her desk looking forward, but this time he can see a small smile. He was about to turn off his PC when he saw another message.  
真嗣从他的笔记本电脑上抬起头来看向绫波。她坐在自己的桌前，目光直视前方，但这次他能看到她嘴角微微上扬的笑容。他正要关闭电脑时，又看到了另一条消息。

**RED-Hot02:** trying to peak at WonderGirls breasts too perv? Lol  
RED-热 02：试图偷瞄 WonderGirls 的胸部，是不是太猥琐了？哈哈

**Shin-chan03:** No… 新酱 03：不…

**RED-Hot02:** Whatever ;P RED-热 02：随你怎么想 ;P

**RED-Hot02:** hey shinji. Tell Misato that I'll be home later tonight.  
RED-Hot02: 嘿，真嗣。告诉美里我今晚晚些时候回家。

**Shin-chan03:** … Shin-chan03: ……

**Shin-chan03:** It's your turn to cook dinner tonight. Guess this means you want me to do it. :-(  
Shin-chan03: 今晚轮到你做饭了。看来你是想让我来做吧。:-(

**RED-Hot02:** Think again idiot. I'm walking home with Hikari but I should be home in time to cook dinner.  
RED-Hot02：再想想吧，傻瓜。我正和光一起走回家，但应该能及时到家做饭。

**Shin-chan03:** What are you making?  
Shin-chan03：你打算做什么？

**RED-Hot02:** it's a trade secret. Lol.  
RED-Hot02：这是商业秘密。哈哈。

**RED-Hot02** has left the room.  
RED-Hot02 已离开房间。

Shinji turned his computer off and took notes for his class. Shinji lived up to his promise to Hikari and didn't talk about the arcade to anyone. It made him feel a little uncomfortable to not talk about it with his friends. Hikari said she would invite them so he didn't see the big deal. Asuka waved good-bye as they parted ways on the walk home. She seemed really excited today.  
真嗣关闭了电脑，并为他的课程做了笔记。他遵守了对光承诺，没有向任何人提及游戏厅的事。这让他感到有些不舒服，因为他不能与朋友们谈论这件事。光说她会邀请他们，所以他不觉得有什么大不了的。在回家的路上分别时，明日香挥手告别，她今天似乎特别兴奋。

Misato wasn't home when he got back. He found Pen-pen laying in the beanbag chair taking a nap. The house was still freezing. The maintenance guy must not of showed up yet. Shinji sat alone in the house only for a few minutes when Misato came walking in. She apologized to Shinji for not being there when he got home. Ritsuko called and they had a late lunch with drinks.  
真嗣回到家时，美里不在。他发现企鹅彭彭躺在豆袋椅上打盹。屋里依然冷冰冰的，维修工肯定还没来。真嗣独自在家坐了几分钟，美里就走了进来。她为真嗣回家时她不在而道歉。律子打来电话，他们一起吃了顿晚午餐，还喝了点酒。

Much later in the day Asuka was as good as her word. She walked in with some groceries and nearly bit Shinji's head off when she found him in the kitchen getting ready to cook. Asuka was heard cooking and chopping in the kitchen. Not as much clamored as the last time she tried to cook, but nearly as many curses.  
那天晚些时候，明日香果然说到做到。她带着一些杂货走进来，发现真嗣在厨房准备做饭时，差点没把他的头咬下来。厨房里传来明日香做饭和切菜的声音，虽然没有上次她尝试做饭时那么吵闹，但咒骂声也差不多。

They all sat down and to everyone's amazement Asuka prepared a very good BLT salad with breadsticks. Like the name it was a salad with the usual lettuce, shredded cheese, and tomatoes, but also had many hunks of bacon. She had finished it up with a creamy garlic dressing. Misato and Shinji addressed her with much praise over the meal. She just went on and feigned modesty as she glowed in the approval. After this meal Shinji had a good idea what Hikari and Asuka were doing at her place. After dinner Asuka changed for bed in her usual shorts and baggy yellow shirt. She was still covering herself in a blanket, because of the cold.  
他们围坐下来，令所有人惊讶的是，明日香准备了一份非常美味的 BLT 沙拉配面包棒。正如其名，这是一份包含生菜、碎奶酪和番茄的沙拉，还加入了大量培根块。她最后用奶油蒜香酱料点缀。美里和真嗣对这顿饭赞不绝口。她继续装作谦虚，内心却因得到认可而欣喜。这顿饭后，真嗣大概明白了光和明日香在她家的活动。晚饭后，明日香换上了她常穿的短裤和宽松的黄色 T 恤准备睡觉。她仍然裹着毯子，因为天气寒冷。

There was a phone call that Misato answered later in the evening. She seemed reluctant to talk to whoever it was. A few minutes later she was saying the call was from Ritsuko. Ritsuko and Maya were going out for drinks and she was joining them. Shinji already knew Misato had gone out for drinks with Ritsuko that afternoon. Judging by the way she was blushing and looking to see Asuka's reaction as she walked out the door he was sure the real person on the other side of the line was Kaji. Shinji at times really did envy the way Kaji could always say just the right thing.  
傍晚时分，美里接到了一个电话，她似乎不太愿意与对方交谈。几分钟后，她声称来电者是律子。律子和真由美打算出去喝酒，她也将加入她们。真嗣已经知道美里那天下午和律子出去喝了酒。从她脸红并观察明日香反应的样子，以及她走出门口的神情来看，真嗣确信电话那头真正的人是加持。有时，真嗣确实羡慕加持总能说出恰到好处的话。

It was a little past nine when Asuka called to Shinji asking him what was on the television. "Nothing really special." he said as he sat in the small couch. He flicked through the channels finding nothing of much interest. "Just some crime dramas, and some of those stupid pre-second impact reality shows." Asuka walked into the TV part of the room and sat next to Shinji on the couch still covered by her blanket. She had brought with her a soda and a bag of her favorite chips. She snatched the remote from Shinji's hand and started to mess with the buttons. "If we can't find anything on these crappy 'parental approved' channels lets try the others." she says with a wicked grin.  
刚过九点，明日香就打电话给真嗣，问他电视上有什么节目。“没什么特别的。”他坐在小沙发上说。他翻看着频道，没找到什么特别感兴趣的。“就是些犯罪剧，还有那些无聊的第二次冲击前的真人秀。”明日香裹着毯子走进电视房，坐在真嗣旁边的沙发上。她带了一瓶汽水和一包她最喜欢的薯片。她从真嗣手里抢过遥控器，开始摆弄按钮。“如果这些烂‘家长批准’的频道找不到什么好看的，我们就试试其他的。”她坏笑着说。

"But... Misato is the only one with the code." say Shinji.  
“但是...只有美里知道密码。”真嗣说。

"Not any more. I saw her put the code in the other day." Asuka brought up some of the adult comedies from the movie library. She looked through to find one with the highest parental warning. "I'm not sure about this Asuka. What if Misato comes back?" Shinji says meekly.  
“现在不是了。我前几天看到她输入密码了。”明日香从电影库中调出了一些成人喜剧。她浏览着，想找一部警告级别最高的。“我不确定这样做好不好，明日香。万一美里回来了怎么办？”真嗣怯生生地说。

Asuka looks to him with a disappointed look and says, "Mein Gott. Don't you ever get tired of being the good little boy. No way she will be home for at least 3 more hours.".  
明日香带着失望的表情看向他，说道：“我的天啊。你就不能厌倦当个乖小孩吗？至少还有三个小时她才会回家。”

"How did you come to that?" he asks.  
“你怎么得出这个结论的？”他问道。

"Cause that's when the bars close in Tokyo-3." She says as if she was addressing a child.  
“因为那是第三新东京市酒吧关门的时间。”她回答得仿佛在跟一个孩子说话。

Shinji just bowed to her reasoning and was starting to get tired of always being the 'good boy'. Asuka giggled in joy and found a suitable movie. The title was, "_Eurotrip"_. A comedy about a boy just getting out of high school who falls in love with a girl in Germany via e-mail. He accidentally sends her a flaming email. The boy really thinks he has fallen in love with this girl and joins his three friends on a whirlwind trip to tour Europe to meet her. There was plenty of nudity, underage drinking, and very funny, gross moments. Much to Shinji's surprise about ten minutes into the movie Asuka slid closer to him, cuddled up, and rested her head on his shoulder. He was nervous and he could hear the ice in his glass rattle as his hand shook. Keeping his eye on the movie Shinji was thinking, "_That's some orange juice."_ and "_Ewww, with his sister."_.  
真嗣只是向她的理由低头，开始厌倦总是当'好孩子'。明日香开心地咯咯笑着，找到了一部合适的电影。片名是《欧洲任我行》。这是一部关于一个刚高中毕业的男孩，通过电子邮件爱上了一个德国女孩的喜剧。他不小心给她发了一封愤怒的邮件。男孩真的认为自己爱上了这个女孩，于是和三个朋友一起踏上了游览欧洲的旋风之旅，去见她。电影中有不少裸露镜头、未成年人饮酒，以及非常搞笑、恶心的时刻。令真嗣惊讶的是，电影开始大约十分钟后，明日香向他靠近，依偎在他身边，把头靠在他的肩膀上。他感到紧张，能听到自己杯中冰块的碰撞声，因为他的手在颤抖。真嗣一边盯着电影，一边想：'那是橙汁吗？'还有'呃，和他妹妹一起。'

At the end of the movie Asuka was even shocked. "_Mein Gott! In das Vatikan!"_ she thought blushing.  
电影结束时，连明日香也震惊了。'我的天！在梵蒂冈！'她想着，脸颊泛红。

It was a little hard to concentrate on the movie as she rubbed up against him. "_Her hair smells like lavender."_ Shinji thinks. The fragrance and warmth nearly puts him into a trance. It was hard to miss Asuka's laugh when this little German boy in the background painted himself with a small mustache and started goose-stepping. They remained close and laughed through the entire film. "If you don't rat me out to Misato we might do this again some time." Asuka says.  
她蹭在他身边，让他难以专心看电影。'她的头发闻起来像薰衣草。' 真嗣心想。这香气和温暖几乎让他陷入恍惚。当背景中的那个德国小男孩给自己画上小胡子并开始正步走时，很难不注意到明日香的笑声。他们紧挨着，全程笑看电影。'如果你不向美里告密，我们或许还能再这样。' 明日香说。

Shinji says, "I wont. This was nice.". She smiles, gets up, and says, "Now off to bed, Dork." She slaps the back of his head. Much lighter then she usually hits him.  
真嗣说：'我不会的，这感觉很好。' 她微笑着起身，说道：'现在去睡觉吧，呆子。' 她轻轻拍了拍他的后脑勺，比平时打他时要轻得多。

It was just then Shinji noticed Pen-pen was giving them a nasty stare. He seemed to know they had been misbehaving. He really didn't care at that moment. They spent some time together and actually enjoyed it. _"Maybe she doesn't really hate me."_  
就在那时，真嗣注意到企鹅彭彭正用不悦的眼神盯着他们。它似乎知道他们刚才在胡闹。那一刻，他真的不在乎。他们共度了一段时光，并且真心享受。'也许她并不是真的讨厌我。'

Shinji got up, put his glass away, and gathered another blanket from the linen closet. Misato still wasn't home. "_She must be really having fun with Kaji tonight."_ he thinks as he turns out the lights and climbs into bed. He rests his head on the pillow with a smile on his face. His arm and shoulder still felt warm from where Asuka was resting against him. The scent of lavender was still fresh on his memory and his eyelids droop...  
真嗣起床，把杯子收好，又从储物柜里拿了一条毯子。美里还没回家。“她今晚一定和加持玩得很开心。”他想着，关上灯，爬上床。他把头靠在枕头上，脸上带着微笑。他的手臂和肩膀仍然能感受到明日香靠在他身上的温暖。薰衣草的香味还清晰地留在他的记忆中，眼皮渐渐沉重...

It was that sweet aroma that caused him to open his eyes. It felt like they were only shut for a second. The room was pitch black, but he felt like someone was in the room. "Who's there?" Shinji says into the dim. His eyes adjusting better to the dark. He can make out a slim female figure. "It's me Shinji." the girl says.  
正是那股甜美的香气让他睁开了眼睛。感觉上眼睛才闭了一秒钟。房间里一片漆黑，但他感觉好像有人在房间里。“谁在那里？”真嗣对着昏暗说道。他的眼睛逐渐适应了黑暗。他能看到一个苗条的女性身影。“是我，真嗣。”女孩说。

"Asuka?" replies Shinji in calm surprise. "Is something wrong?"  
“明日香？”真嗣平静中带着惊讶地回应。“有什么事吗？”

"It's too cold in my room." Asuka pouts as she walks to the side of his bed. "I thought I could come in here and we could keep each other... warm." Asuka lifts the covers and slips into his bed.  
"我的房间太冷了。" 明日香噘着嘴走到他的床边，"我想我可以进来，我们可以互相取暖。" 明日香掀开被子，溜进了他的床。

"A-Asuka." he stutters. "明、明日香。" 他结巴地说。

"Shut up and just relax." she says in a sweet tone. She slides up against Shinji under the covers. He feels her arm wrap around his chest. "You should appreciate your good fortune. You know. I've never slept in the same bed with a boy before, and I chose you."  
"闭嘴，放松就好。" 她用甜美的语气说道。她滑到真嗣的被子下，紧贴着他。他感觉到她的手臂环抱在他的胸前。"你应该感激你的好运。你知道的，我以前从没和男生同床共枕过，而我选择了你。"

Shinji's breathing becomes shallow. He can feel her soft skin move along his arm and it hits him like a bolt of lighting. "ASUKA, are you naked?"  
真嗣的呼吸变得浅促。他能感觉到她柔软的肌肤沿着他的手臂移动，这感觉如同电击一般。“明日香，你没穿衣服吗？”

Asuka giggles. He feels her nuzzle at his neck. "We can keep each other warm this way. Flesh... to... flesh. It could be really awesome." Her hand slowly slides up inside his shirt and fingernails caress over his bare chest."  
明日香咯咯笑起来。他感觉到她在他的脖颈处蹭来蹭去。“我们可以这样互相取暖。肌肤...相...亲。这感觉会很棒的。”她的手缓缓滑入他的衬衫内，用指甲轻抚他裸露的胸膛。

Only sounds coming out of Shinji's mouth sound more like a whispering, sputtering car. "W-w-what about Misato? If - if she find us… we… might get in trou-" Asuka cuts Shinji off by placing her finger gently on his lips and says, "Sh shh shhh shhhh. Relax idiot." He sees her lean in smiling. Their lips are barely an inch apart. He starts to shake all over. "Oh, Don't shiver, mein Liebchen. I'll keep you... warm... There's just one thing I really need to tell you… before." She bats her eyes and smiles.  
真嗣嘴里发出的声音更像是低声细语，断断续续。“那...那...那美里小姐怎么办？如果...如果她发现我们…我们…可能会惹上麻烦的-”明日香用手指轻轻按住他的嘴唇，打断了他的话，“嘘嘘嘘嘘。放松点，傻瓜。”他看到她微笑着靠近。他们的嘴唇仅隔一寸之遥。他开始全身颤抖。“哦，别发抖，我的爱人。我会让你...暖和的...只是有一件事我必须先告诉你…”她眨了眨眼，微笑着。

"W-w-hat is it?" he asks...  
"什...什么？" 他结巴地问道...

Pushing roughly on his shoulders she leans up and with an angry scream she says, "WAKE UP, DUMMKOPF!"  
她粗暴地推着他的肩膀，倾身向前，愤怒地尖叫道：“醒醒，笨蛋！”

The sun is bright as Shinji's eyes burst open suddenly only to see Asuka standing by his bed rather then inside it. She looks angry. She's wearing sweat clothes that appear too big for her. He can only guess they are Misato's. "It's about time." she says coldly. "Misato asked me to come wake you up. I come in here and find you with that stupid grin on your face and-" Asuka's eyes glance further down and something catches her eye.  
阳光明媚，真嗣的眼睛突然睁开，却看到明日香站在床边而不是躺在床上。她看起来很生气。她穿着似乎过大的运动服。他只能猜测那是美里小姐的。“你总算醒了。”她冷冷地说。“美里让我来叫醒你。我进来就看到你脸上那傻笑，还有——”明日香的目光向下移动，突然注意到了什么。

Misato has just pressed down on the toaster when she suddenly hears a high pitched scream. "_That came from Shinji's room."_ Misato thinks.  
"碇真嗣的房间。" 美里心想。

"Mein Gott! Is that all you males can think about!" Misato hears Asuka yells from Shinji's room.  
"天哪！你们这些男生脑子里就只有这些吗！" 美里听到明日香从真嗣房间里喊道。

"What!" She hears Shinji's scream. "I-I-I can't help that! J-just get out of my room!"  
什么！" 她听到真嗣的尖叫，"我...我...我控制不了啊！就...就从我房间出去！

"Yeah, like I want to stay." Asuka says as she storms out and slams the door shut behind her. Misato sees Asuka walk into the kitchen, pour herself some orange juice, and takes a seat at the table. Cursing in German under her breath. "I take it you woke Shin-chan up." Misato says looking to the agitated hot head.  
"是啊，好像我想留下似的。" 明日香一边说着，一边怒气冲冲地走出去，砰的一声把门关上。美里看到明日香走进厨房，给自己倒了一杯橙汁，然后坐在桌旁。她低声用德语咒骂着。"我猜你把真嗣吵醒了。" 美里看着那个焦躁的火爆女孩说道。

"Oh, he's UP alright." Asuka says in a bitter tone, looking out the window.  
"哦，他确实醒了。" 明日香用一种苦涩的语气说道，目光投向窗外。

A/N: This is a rather long chapter. Lot of dialog and emotions to run through.  
作者的话：这一章相当长，包含大量对话和情感起伏。

I was pleased the reaction the dream sequence got from chapter three. That's as about as hot as things are going to get. I really look forward to my reviews and the questions people have.  
我很高兴看到大家对第三章梦境序列的反应。那差不多是情节中最激烈的时刻了。我非常期待大家的评论和提出的问题。

I have noticed in a lot of fan fictions they give the people in Eva current technology. I tried to take something that is current, but tweaked it a bit. best example is on the movies they pick. I got the idea from things like those direct tv options, and download able shows for I-Pods. I thought. What if in the future it's common place to be able to download any movie whenever you want. Some things give you this option, but only a select few movies. I just took it to the next level.  
我在很多同人小说中注意到，他们给 Eva 中的人物配备了现代技术。我尝试选取一些当前的技术，但稍作调整。最好的例子就是电影的选择。我受到类似直接电视选项和可下载到 iPod 的节目的启发。我想，如果未来能够随时下载任何电影变得司空见惯会怎样。有些服务提供了这个选项，但仅限于少数电影。我只是将其推向了更远的层次。

Hard core Eva fans will recognize a name appearing in this chapter. Oh yeah, and Misato is half naked. My bit of fan service.  
硬核 Eva 粉丝会认出本章中出现的一个名字。哦，对了，还有 Misato 半裸的场景。这是我的一点粉丝福利。

This chapter has had some editing after some of the reviews. I realized that I really didn't sell the moments and I wasn't getting across the feel I wanted in certain moments.  
在收到一些评论后，我对这一章进行了一些编辑。我意识到我并没有很好地展现那些时刻，也没有传达出我在某些时刻想要的感觉。

**Chapter 4: Blind, Deaf and Dumb Date  
第四章：盲聋哑相亲会**

Deep under the high tech city of Tokyo-3 in the Geo-Front is the NERV Headquarters. Employees were mulling about on random duties. It has been weeks since the last Angel attack. One would think for NERV HQ that would be a great thing, but when your whole purpose surrounds destroying the Angels that can make for very little to do.  
在高科技城市东京-3 地下的 Geo-Front 深处，是 NERV 总部的所在地。员工们正忙于各自的杂务。距离上一次使徒袭击已经过去了几周。对于 NERV 总部来说，这本应是件好事，但当你的全部使命围绕着消灭使徒时，这可能意味着几乎无事可做。

In NERV's cafeteria sits four of NERV's more important officials. Many of which have been close friends since college. Their own personal histories have lead them to work for NERV. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, chief science officer, is lazily glancing through past research notes, and sitting to her left Maya Ibuki, control room operator, is smiling and flipping through a novel.  
在 NERV 的食堂里，坐着四位 NERV 的重要官员。他们中的许多人自大学时代起就是密友。各自的个人经历引领他们加入了 NERV。首席科学官赤木律子博士正懒洋洋地翻阅过去的研究笔记，而坐在她左边的控制室操作员伊吹玛雅则面带微笑，翻阅着一本小说。

Misato Katsuragi resting her head on the table upon her crossed arms. Her meal is barely picked at, but her beer is well more then half gone. To her right is NERV special investigations officer, Ryoji Kaji. He sits leaning back, arms limp at his side, and head tilted back. He would appear to be dead if it wasn't for the fact his eyes are blinking, looking to the ceiling, and moaning in boredom every five minutes.  
葛城美里将头枕在交叠的双臂上，趴在桌上。她的餐食几乎未动，但啤酒却已喝了大半。在她右边坐着的是 NERV 特别调查官加持良治。他向后靠着椅背，双臂无力地垂在身侧，头向后仰。若不是他的眼睛还在眨动，望着天花板，每隔五分钟就无聊地呻吟一声，看起来简直像是死了。

"So Asuka was pretty upset by that time." says Misato looking across the table to her friend Ritsuko. "She just kept grumbling and didn't say anything to Shinji."  
“所以那时明日香相当不高兴。”美里看着对面的朋友律子说道，“她只是一直嘟囔着，对真嗣什么也没说。”

"Guess no one ever told her that boys really have no control over that sort of thing." says Ritsuko putting down her notes and starts eating again. "You could always give her 'The Talk'."  
"“估计没人告诉过她，男孩对那种事情其实控制不了。”律子放下笔记，又开始吃饭，“你大可以给她来个‘性教育谈话’。”

"Oh yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun." says Misato rolling her eyes. Kaji chuckles picturing that conversation. "I don't think she was mad about that as much other things. I loaned her some of my clothes to wear. They didn't fit her too well and I think that was a blow to her pride. A reminder of how immature she still is."  
"哦，是啊，听起来真有趣。" 美里翻了个白眼说道。加持想象着那场对话，轻笑出声。"我觉得她并不是因为那件事生气，而是因为其他事情。我借给她一些我的衣服穿，它们不太合身，我想这对她的自尊心是个打击。这是对她仍然不成熟的提醒。"

"Or a reminder of how much bigger you've gotten." says Kaji. Misato gives a jerk and Kaji suddenly yells, "Aggh!". Misato gives a devilish smile from the swift kick she just delivered to his leg.  
"或者是在提醒你已经变得多么壮实了。" 加持说道。美里猛地一抖，加持突然大叫一声，"啊！"。美里迅速踢了他的腿一脚，露出了恶魔般的微笑。

"So Shinji was just a target for her frustration?" says Maya.  
"所以真嗣只是她发泄不满的对象吗？" 玛雅问道。

"Well, he is her favorite target." says Misato.  
"嗯，他是她最喜欢的目标。" 米萨托说道。

"Their school will be out for summer break this week, right?" asks Ritsuko.  
"他们学校这周就要放暑假了吧？" 丽萨库问道。

"End of next week." says Misato. "We'll need to find something to keep them busy, or… from killing each other."  
"下周结束。" 米萨托说，"我们得找点事让他们忙起来，不然……免得他们互相残杀。"

"Well, we have a synch test scheduled for them Sunday." says Ritsuko. "Commander Fuyutsuki was also talking about running some battle simulations in the Geo-Front."  
"嗯，我们安排了他们周日的同步测试。" 丽说，"冬月副司令还提到要在地下都市进行一些战斗模拟。"

"It's a pity really." says Kaji still looking to the ceiling, and the ladies look to him for explanation. "They can't just be like kids and enjoy their youth."  
"真是可惜。" 加持仍然望着天花板，女士们转向他寻求解释，"他们不能像普通孩子那样享受青春。"

They sit in a thoughtful pause for a few minutes. Maya says, "Is there any explanation why there hasn't been an Angel attack?"  
他们沉默地坐了几分钟。真矢问道："有没有解释为什么没有天使来袭？"

"If there is no one is telling me." says Ritsuko.  
"如果没有人告诉我。" 丽说。

"How many weeks has it been already? I've lost count." says Misato.  
"已经过去多少周了？我都记不清了。" 美里说。

"Six." answers Ritsuko. "六周。" 丽回答。

"I'm sooo bored." whines Maya. "I wish an Angel would attack." Even Kaji has lifted his head to look to Maya in silent confusion who has just realized what she just said. Blushing she says, "Oh wait! I-I didn't mean…" Cutting herself off she hides behind her book. Every Angel attack is a possibility for a Third Impact, in which would wipe out all of humanity.  
"我真是无聊死了。" 玛雅抱怨道。"真希望有个使徒来袭击。" 连卡吉也抬起头，用无声的困惑看向玛雅，她这才意识到自己刚才说了什么。脸红着，她连忙说："哦，等等！我-我不是那个意思……" 她打断自己的话，躲到书后面去了。每一次使徒的袭击都可能是第三次冲击的导火索，那将毁灭全人类。

Kaji always quick to a ladies rescue comes up with a plan to deflect the attention from the awkward silence that fills the group. "So Katsuragi," he says. "I thought last night you said the kids have been getting along better."  
卡吉总是很快就能为女士解围，他想出了一个计划来打破这尴尬的沉默。"那么，葛城，"他说，"我记得你昨晚说孩子们相处得更好了。"

"Yeah." she says in surprise. "Asuka seems to be mellowing out a bit. Last night she actually made a really good meal."  
"是啊。" 她惊讶地说，"明日香似乎变得温和了一些。昨晚她居然做了一顿非常美味的饭菜。

"Asuka becoming a domestic woman?" chuckles Ritsuko.  
"明日香变成家庭主妇了？" 律子笑着说。

"Hmm. Maybe love in in the air." Kaji adds.  
"嗯，或许是爱情在作祟吧。" 加持补充道。

"For those three minutes in the day they aren't at each others throats they do look like a rather cute couple." says Misato.  
"在一天中那三分钟他们不互相掐架的时候，他们看起来还真是一对挺可爱的情侣。" 美里说。

Ritsuko glances to her friends across the table. "_Who does that remind me of?"_ she thinks with a sly smile.  
律子瞥了一眼桌子对面的朋友们。“这让我想起了谁呢？”她带着狡黠的微笑想道。

"You should of seen the outfit she was wearing on that movie night." says Misato. "I wasn't sure if she was showing off for Hikari or Shinji." She looks to Ritsuko who seems as curious as herself. "Oddly enough I don't think Asuka is so much of a problem. Shinji just doesn't have much confidence with girls,….. or anything else for that matter."  
“你真该看看她在电影之夜穿的那套衣服。”美里说，“我不确定她是为了光还是真嗣而炫耀。”她看向律子，后者似乎和她一样好奇。“说来奇怪，我觉得明日香并不是什么大问题。真嗣只是不太有和女孩子相处的自信，……或者说，对其他任何事情也是这样。”

"Maybe I could take him out to lunch." says Kaji. "Give him some of tips dealing with women."  
“或许我可以带他出去吃午饭。”加持说，“给他一些和女性相处的建议。”

"Great." chirps Misato. "After that I'll need to get him deprogrammed for a month." Maya and Ritsuko chuckle.  
"太好了。" 美里轻快地说，"之后我得让他接受一个月的反洗脑。" 玛雅和律子轻声笑了起来。

"Uh, is anyone else a little curious why four college educated adults are so interested in the romantic life of two teenagers?" asks a timid Maya.  
"呃，有没有人稍微好奇一下，为什么四个受过大学教育的成年人会对两个青少年的恋爱生活这么感兴趣？" 玛雅怯生生地问道。

"That's easy." says Kaji.  
"这很简单。" 加持说。

"We're bored." says Misato.  
"我们好无聊。" 米萨托说道。

Ritsuko glows in the humor how they share the same thoughts. Amazing what can happen when a couple lives together for two years. "So… what was the movie you all picked last?" asks Ritsuko.  
律子因他们想法一致而感到有趣，不禁微笑。一对情侣同居两年后，会发生许多奇妙的事情。"那么……你们最后选了哪部电影？" 律子问道。

"Magic Number 7." sighs Misato. The two other ladies imitate Misato's moan. The movie is well known with almost all women.  
"《魔法数字 7》。" 米萨托叹息道。另外两位女士也模仿米萨托的叹息。这部电影在女性中几乎无人不知。

Kaji looks up for the second time with a look as if he had just drank expired milk. "Oh lord!" he groans. "Not that movie." He leans his head back and finishes his thought. "You dragged me to that 'thing' three times. Are you trying to drown that poor boy in estrogen?" Kaji suddenly feels six pairs of eyes boring into him. He has just realized the company he is keeping. He's almost too afraid to make a run for it.  
加治第二次抬头时，脸上带着仿佛刚喝了过期牛奶的表情。“哦，天哪！”他呻吟道。“别是那部电影。”他仰起头，完成了他的思绪。“你拉我去看那‘玩意儿’三次了。你是想让那可怜的男孩淹没在雌激素里吗？”加治突然感觉到六双眼睛正盯着他。他这才意识到自己所处的环境。他几乎害怕到不敢逃跑。

"Oh, crap." is all he manages to say before-  
“哦，糟糕。”他刚说出这句话，就——

Far above the Geo-Front lunch time in school has the teens sitting on the roof. Hikari, Asuka and Rei were sitting in a small group. Rei just sat silently eating not joining the quiet conversation. Kensuke had brought a collection of pictures he gathered on his last trip to an aircraft carrier.  
在 Geo-Front 之上，学校的午餐时间，少年们坐在屋顶上。光、明日香和丽坐在一个小圈子里。丽静静地坐着吃饭，没有加入这场安静的对话。健介带来了一组他在上次访问航空母舰时收集的照片。

"Look at these pictures" Kensuke says forcing several shots into his friends hands. "That jet was piloted by a real war hero. I saw the barracks. This shot is awesome. I got to sit in the gunners seat. I nearly got kicked off the boat for taking pictures here."  
"看看这些照片，"健介说着，硬是把几张照片塞到朋友手里。"那架喷气机是由真正的战斗英雄驾驶的。我看到了营房。这张照片太棒了。我坐进了炮手座位。差点因为在这里拍照被赶下船。

"Why can't you ever go to a beach and take pictures of girls?" asks Touji as he casually flips through the pictures. Shinji isn't even looking. He glances over to the girls who are a few feet away. Rei no longer has a bandage on her arm, but a slight bruise; Hikari has been acting nervous, and Asuka has still refused to say anything to him all day.  
"你怎么就不能去海滩拍些女孩的照片呢？" 东治边说边随意地翻看着照片。真嗣甚至都没看。他瞥了一眼几英尺外的女孩们。绫波已经不再用绷带包扎手臂，但还有些许淤青；光一直显得很紧张，而明日香一整天都没跟他说过话。

Touji slaps the back of your head with the prints. "Still in the dog house with the Mrs., Ikari?" he says.  
"东治用照片背面拍了拍你的后脑勺。"还在跟老婆闹别扭吗，碇？" 他说道。

Shinji looks back to his friend. "She's mad at me about something this morning." says Shinji. His cheeks glowing. Touji is about to lean in to interrogate his friend for the juicy details when the bell warning the kids that the lunch break has ended chimes. Kensuke gathers up his pictures and the girls walk back into the school. Shinji tried to say something to Asuka as she passed by, but he stops himself. "_I'll just make things worse."_ he thinks.  
真嗣回头看向他的朋友。“她今天早上因为某件事生我的气。”真嗣说道，脸颊泛红。当午餐结束的铃声响起时，东治正要凑近盘问朋友那些八卦细节。健介收拾起他的照片，女孩们走回学校。真嗣试图在明日香经过时说些什么，但他阻止了自己。“我只会让事情变得更糟。”他想。

"If you want pictures of girls I got this shot of the commander on the boat." Kensuke says handing Touji a few pictures. "She reminded me of Misato." Touji looks at the picture smiling.  
“如果你想看女孩的照片，我这里有指挥官在船上的镜头。”健介说着递给东治几张照片。“她让我想起了美里。”东治看着照片微笑。

"OH yeah." Touji says smiling. "Look at that butt. Makes me think about enlisting."  
“哦，是的。”东治笑着说。“看那臀部。让我都想入伍了。”

Shinji walks the halls looking to his shoes. He is suddenly stopped by bumping into someone. Glancing back up quickly he sputters, "I-I'm sorry I wasn't-".  
真嗣走在走廊上，低头看着自己的鞋子。突然，他撞到了某人，急忙抬头结巴地说：“我、我...对不起，我没...”

"It's alright." says the short haired brunette girl. Her hair is choppy, but well kept. Her eyes are bright and friendly. The red ribbon of her uniform is untied. "You looked pretty deep in thought." Shinji just gave a weak smile. "Hey, your Ikari the Eva pilot aren't you?" the girl asks. Shinji just nods not sure if she means that as a good or bad thing. She smiles. "Oh cool. My names Mana. I'd really like to talk about-" She is cut off by the last warning bell. "Oh darn, " grips Mana. "I got to go. I can't afford to be late again." She runs off in a mad sprint. "See you around."  
“没关系。”说话的是一位短发棕色头发的女孩。她的头发虽然有些参差不齐，但打理得很好。她的眼睛明亮而友善，校服上的红色丝带没有系好。“你看起来想得很入神。”真嗣只是无力地笑了笑。“嘿，你是碇真嗣，那个 EVA 驾驶员对吧？”女孩问道。真嗣点了点头，不确定她这么说是好是坏。她微笑着说：“哦，真酷。我叫真名。我很想和你聊聊——”她的话被最后的预备铃打断了。“哦，糟糕，”真名抱怨道，“我得走了。我不能再迟到了。”她疯狂地跑开了。“再见。”

"Later." says a confused Shinji as he walks into class 2-A. Kensuke and Touji have waited for him at the door and saw the whole little conversation with the cute girl, Mana.  
“回头见。”真嗣困惑地说，走进了 2-A 教室。剑介和东治已经在门口等他，目睹了他和那位名叫真名的可爱女孩的整个小对话。

"You shopping for a mistress?" Touji jokes.  
"你在找情人吗？" 东治打趣道。

"Wow, she talked with you." says Kensuke watching after the girl. His eyes following her every move.  
"哇，她跟你说话了。" 健介望着那女孩的背影说道，目光紧随着她的一举一动。

"Huh?" says Shinji. "Who is she?"  
"啊？" 真嗣疑惑地问，"她是谁？"

"That's Mana Kirishima." says Kensuke. "She works for the school paper. She's in our grade." His mood drops as she turns the corner and is out of sight.  
"那是桐嶋真奈。" 健介说道，"她在校报工作，和我们同年级。" 当她拐过拐角消失在视线中时，他的情绪明显低落。

"Yeah." says Touji. "She was one of those girls the ball player was cheating on. I heard she could be a real bitch when she wants to. Nice legs though."  
"是啊。" 透治说，"她就是那个球类运动员劈腿的其中一个女生。我听说她要是想的话，可以真的很刻薄。不过腿倒是挺好看的。

They walk back into class and the rest of the school day goes by at a slow pace. On the walk home Shinji tried to think of several ways he could make up for this morning's misunderstanding, but shot down any plan that started with an apology. That always just seemed to make her more angry. They got home and Asuka changed into the clothes Misato loaned her.  
他们走回教室，余下的学校时光过得异常缓慢。回家的路上，真嗣试图想出几种弥补今早误会的办法，但任何以道歉开头的计划都被他否决了。那似乎总是让她更加生气。他们到家后，明日香换上了美里借给她的衣服。

Misato tried to stir a conversation between the three during dinner. All attempts were unsuccessful. During the meal Asuka ask someone to pass the salt. It was sitting right in front of Shinji. He tentatively lifted it and passed it to her. They looked into each other eyes and she said simply, "Thanks.".  
晚餐时，美里试图在三人之间挑起话题，但所有尝试都未成功。用餐期间，明日香请人递盐。盐瓶正放在真嗣面前。他小心翼翼地拿起并递给她。他们目光交汇，她简单地说了一句：“谢谢。”

Misato just smiled as she watched them. "_Well, it's progress."_ she thought.  
美里只是微笑着看着他们。“嗯，这是个进步了。”她心想。

They all finished their dinner and Shinji gathered the dishes. Shinji sat at the TV table doing his homework. Asuka, who had already finished her work, laid on the floor flipping through a magazine. Misato was sitting a few feet away from the teens. While reading her new pop culture magazine she heard Shinji groan about his school work. "What wrong now?" asked Asuka in dismay.  
他们吃完晚餐后，真嗣收拾了碗碟。真嗣坐在电视机前做作业。明日香已经完成了自己的功课，躺在地板上翻阅杂志。美里坐在离青少年几英尺远的地方。在阅读她的新流行文化杂志时，她听到真嗣对学校作业发出呻吟。“现在又怎么了？”明日香失望地问道。

"I'm just having some trouble with this." Shinji said waving to his laptop screen.  
"我只是在处理这个时遇到了点麻烦。" 真嗣说着，向他的笔记本电脑屏幕挥了挥手。

Rolling her eyes Asuka gets up and sits next to Shinji. "Move over, Stupid. Let me see." she says in a huff.  
明日香翻了个白眼，起身坐到真嗣旁边。"挪一挪，笨蛋。让我看看。" 她气呼呼地说。

Misato smiles as she watches them talk about school work. Asuka was pointing out Shinji's mistakes and he sat listening carefully to the explanation. "_They are so cute together."_ Misato thinks. She reads her magazine glancing to the couple after every few pages.  
美里微笑着看着他们讨论学业。明日香正在指出真嗣的错误，而他则认真地听着解释。"他们在一起真可爱。" 美里心想。她一边翻阅杂志，一边每隔几页就瞥一眼这对小情侣。

It was movie night again and this is week was Misato's pick. Shinji was done with his homework and was very grateful to Asuka. Has an act of gratitude he prepared the snacks. He took small scoop-able tortilla chips and put together a big rack of little bite sized tacos made with Asuka's favorite ground sausage.  
又到了电影之夜，这周轮到碇真嗣的监护人葛城美里选片。真嗣已经完成了作业，对明日香心存感激。为了表达谢意，他准备了零食。他拿了些可以舀着吃的小片玉米片，制作了一大排小巧的迷你塔可，里面夹着明日香最喜欢的碎香肠。

Misato was very careful to pick a movie everyone would enjoy. It was an edgy comedy, but nowhere near as wild as the one Shinji and Asuka watched the other night. It was about a wild college guy who lives to do nothing, but party. His father pulls his money, and the guy hires his skills for planning parties out to anyone who is willing to pay. There was a rather gross scene with some very "special" desserts. Asuka had covered her eyes during that scene. At the end of the movie Misato was wiping a tear of laughter from her eye as she changed the channel. Asuka asked for the remote and Misato tossed it to her.  
葛城美里非常用心地挑选了一部大家都会喜欢的电影。这是一部尖锐的喜剧片，但远没有真嗣和明日香前一晚看的那部那么疯狂。电影讲述了一个狂野的大学生，整天无所事事，只想着开派对。他的父亲断绝了他的经济来源，于是他开始将自己的派对策划技能出售给任何愿意支付的人。其中有一段相当恶心的场景，涉及一些非常“特别”的甜点。明日香在那段场景时捂住了眼睛。电影结束时，葛城美里擦去笑出的眼泪，切换了频道。明日香要了遥控器，葛城美里便扔给了她。

Asuka mostly just surfed the channels for a few minutes until she came to something that caught her interest. She barely watched it. She just kept eating Shinji's snacks and flipping through some magazines. Misato relaxed and talked with Shinji casually for the rest of the night.  
明日香大多只是随意浏览频道，直到发现某个吸引她注意的内容。她几乎没怎么看，只是不停地吃着真嗣的零食，翻阅着一些杂志。美里则放松下来，与真嗣闲聊度过余下的夜晚。

"Night kids." Misato said. "Thanks for cooking Shinji. Those were really good. Be sure to write those chips down on the grocery list for next time." She walked past Shinji and stroked the back of his hair. It sent tingles down his back.  
“晚安，孩子们。”美里说道，“真嗣，谢谢你做的饭，真的很好吃。记得下次把薯片加到购物清单上。”她从真嗣身边走过，轻抚了一下他的后脑勺，这让他感到一阵酥麻。

"Yeah, they were good." said Asuka dropping the last taco chip in her mouth. "Night Misato. Night Third." Asuka got up and walking past Shinji she smacked him in the head. She walked into her room and shut the door.  
“嗯，确实不错。”明日香说着，将最后一片玉米片送入口中，“晚安，美里。晚安，三号。”明日香站起身，经过真嗣时，她拍了一下他的头。随后她走进自己的房间，关上了门。

Shinji gathered the dishes and washed them. He went to his room and turned out the light. He took a quick glance around the dark room. He sniffed the air checking for a scent. Not finding anything odd he laid down and smiled. It was a nice dream that found him that night.  
真嗣收拾好碗碟并清洗干净。他回到房间，关掉了灯。他快速环顾了一下昏暗的房间。他嗅了嗅空气，检查是否有异味。没有发现任何异常，他躺下并微笑着。那晚，他做了一个美好的梦。

Asuka woke up late Saturday. Tucked under her blanket she stretched and groaned. She reached for her alarm clock to check the time. "Damn, running late." she says dropping the clock to the floor. Tossing the covers off she can still feel the chill in the air. "_If I ever get my hands on that jerk who is suppose to get this fixed I'm shoving his wrench right up his ass."_ she thinks.  
明日香在周六醒来时已经很晚了。她蜷缩在被子里伸展身体，发出呻吟声。她伸手去拿闹钟查看时间。“该死，要迟到了。”她说着，把闹钟扔到地上。掀开被子，她仍能感受到空气中的寒意。“要是让我逮到那个应该来修理这玩意的混蛋，我非把他的扳手塞进他屁股不可。”她心想。

Asuka passed her mirror and stopped. She examined herself. Seeing these baggy clothes she frowns. She pulls the clothes taunt to her skin and strikes several poses. Trying to improve how she looks in these grown woman's clothes if they would fit. Letting go she huffs in frustration. "Maybe Hikari will be up for some shopping after the arcade." she says. Scratching her head she walks out of her room.  
明日香经过镜子时停了下来。她审视着自己。看到这些宽松的衣服，她皱起了眉头。她用力将衣服紧贴身体，摆出几个姿势。试图改善自己在这身成熟女性服装中的形象，如果它们能合身的话。松开手后，她沮丧地叹了口气。“也许去完游戏厅后，可以叫上光去买些东西。”她说着，挠了挠头，走出了房间。

First site greeting her is Shinji sitting at the table listening to his SDAT player. Pen-pen sits in the seat next to him and just watches. He's wearing a reversed yellow hat, red shirt, green drawstring shorts, and sneakers. Asuka glances over him and thinks, "_Hmm, looks like he can dress himself when he wants to."_. She walks past him to the bathroom. She freshens up, combs her hair, and walks back into her room to dress.  
迎接她的是坐在桌边听着 SDAT 播放器的真嗣。企鹅 Pen-pen 坐在他旁边的座位上，只是静静地看着。他戴着一顶反戴的黄色帽子，穿着红色 T 恤，绿色束带短裤和运动鞋。明日香瞥了他一眼，心想：“嗯，看来他想要的时候还是能自己打扮的。”她从他身边走过，进了浴室。她洗漱一番，梳了梳头发，然后回到自己的房间换衣服。

Opening her closet she scans for some cute outfit. She grabs a black shirt with orange sleeves, blue military short-shorts, thin black knees socks, red shoes, and a red visor from her closet. Asuka dresses, and stands in front of the mirror again. Fixing her hair she avoids her neural clips and instead picks her red hair bows. Fixing her makeup she spins in front of the mirror to examine her work. Smiling she thinks, "_Mmm, Cute."_. Winking to herself she walks out of her room.  
打开衣柜，她扫视着寻找一套可爱的装扮。她从衣柜里拿出一件黑色上衣配橙色袖子，蓝色军装短裤，薄薄的黑色膝袜，红色鞋子和一顶红色遮阳帽。明日香换好衣服，再次站在镜子前。她整理着头发，避开了神经夹，而是选择了红色的发带。她补了补妆，在镜子前转了一圈检查自己的打扮。满意地笑了笑，心想：“嗯，真可爱。”对着镜子眨了眨眼，她走出了房间。

Shinji is still sitting there listening to his player. Asuka shakes her head in frustration and grabs some peanut butter toast with orange juice. Only now does she notice Misato sitting and watching TV. She glances at her watch. It's time for her to leave if she is going to meet up with Hikari. "Misato, I'm going out." she says. "I got my phone."  
真嗣还坐在那里听着他的播放器。明日香无奈地摇了摇头，抓起一些花生酱吐司配橙汁。直到这时，她才注意到美里正坐着看电视。她瞥了一眼手表。如果她要和光见面，现在就得出发了。“美里，我要出门了。”她说，“我带了手机。”

"I'm going out too." says Shinji sitting up. Asuka looks to him for a second, but just walks out the door. "Bye kids. Be careful." Misato calls out to them.  
“我也要出去。”真嗣坐起身来说。明日香看了他一眼，但只是径直走出了门。“孩子们，再见。小心点。”美里向他们喊道。

The pilots walked for about five blocks when Asuka noticed that Shinji was still behind her. Spinning on her heel she looking to Shinji. "Quit following me!" she says, and stomps on his foot.  
驾驶员们走了大约五个街区，这时明日香注意到真嗣还在她后面。她猛地转身面向真嗣，“别跟着我！”她说着，一脚踩在他的脚上。

"Ow! What was that for?" says the shocked boy.  
"哎哟！这是为什么？" 男孩惊讶地说道。

"Where the hell do you think you're going?"  
"你以为你要去哪儿？"

"The… arcade. Hikari, invited me."  
"去…游戏厅。光邀请我了。"

Asuka looks confused. "Hikari what? She didn't tell me-"  
明日香看起来很困惑。“光什么？她没告诉我——”

"ASUKA! Ikari-kun! Hey!" Asuka is cut off by Hikari in the distance running toward them. Shinji is bouncing on one foot and Asuka looks angry and confused. Hikari runs up to them panting. She's dressed rather casual for the usually modest class representative. A striped shirt and coverall styled dress, knee length skirt. Smiling brightly she rests her hands on her knees and tries to regain her breath. "I'm so glad you two are here. " she says. "Is Touji here yet?"  
“明日香！碇君！嘿！”明日香被远处跑来的光打断了。真嗣单脚跳着，而明日香看起来既生气又困惑。光跑到他们面前，气喘吁吁。她今天穿得比平时作为班长时的保守打扮要随意得多，一件条纹衬衫和工装风格的连衣裙，裙摆及膝。她笑容灿烂，双手撑在膝盖上，试图平复呼吸。“真高兴你们俩在这儿。”她说。“东治到了吗？”

"Touji?" asks an angry Asuka. "Who all did you invite?" Hikari gives a weak smile. She opens her mouth, but before she can start to explain another person turns the corner.  
“东治？”愤怒的明日香问道。“你还邀请了谁？”光露出一个勉强的微笑。她张开嘴，但还没来得及解释，另一个人转过拐角出现了。

"Hey all." Touji comes around and he's dressed as casual as usual. Jogging pants and shirt. Touji walks up to Shinji and gives him a punch in the arm. "Hey man. This should be great. I heard this arcade is jam packed with cool stuff." he says.  
"嘿，大家好。" 东治一如既往地穿着休闲装走了过来，运动裤搭配衬衫。他走到真嗣身边，给了他一拳，说道："嘿，哥们儿，这地方应该很不错。我听说这个游戏厅里有很多酷炫的东西。

Asuka looks to her friend for a fast explanation, but Hikari isn't looking to her. She's staring at Touji. Her fingers are crossed, smiling, and blushing as she eyes him. Asuka looks from Hikari to Touji and back to her friend, and it all falls into place. "_She didn't."_ Asuka thinks. Grabbing Hikari by the arm she turns to the boys and says, "Stay Put!". She pulls Hikari a few yards away and the boys start their own conversation.  
明日香迅速向她的朋友寻求解释，但光并没有看向她，而是盯着东治。她的手指交叉着，面带微笑，脸颊泛红，目光紧随东治。明日香从光看向东治，再转回看向她的朋友，一切豁然开朗。"她不会吧。" 明日香心想。她抓住光的胳膊，转向男孩们说："待在这儿别动！" 然后拉着光走了几码远，男孩们则开始了自己的对话。

"You didn't do what I think you just did?" asks an infuriated Asuka.  
"你不会做了我想你刚做的事吧？" 明日香愤怒地问道。

"Huh?" says Hikari. "嗯？" 光说道。

"You set yourself up on a blind date with that goofball."  
"你居然安排自己和那个傻瓜相亲。"

"Oh, Asuka." Hikari says. Her plan found out. "I'm sorry. It's just. I- I just want him to see me as someone other then the class rep." She looks like she may cry. "I want him to see me as a girl who can have fun too."  
"哦，明日香。" 光说道，她的计划被识破了。"对不起。只是，我——我只是希望他能把我看作不仅仅是班长。" 她看起来快要哭了。"我希望他能把我看作一个也能玩得开心的女孩。

"Then why are me and the idiot here too?"  
"那为什么我和这个笨蛋也在这里？"

"I was afraid. If I asked him to just go out with me he wouldn't come, and I knew if it was you and me he most certainly wouldn't come….. So I invited Shinji too." Hikari looked honestly upset. She bows her head and pleads with Asuka. Asuka just cracks under her compassion for her friend. "I take it you want me to keep Shinji busy so you can get all lovey-dovey with the block head?" Asuka says.  
"我害怕。如果我只叫他和我出去，他不会来的，而且我知道如果是你和我，他肯定不会来……所以我连真嗣也邀请了。" 光看起来真的很沮丧。她低下头，向明日香恳求。明日香在对她朋友的同情下屈服了。"我猜你是想让我缠住真嗣，这样你就可以和那个木头脑袋亲热了？" 明日香说道。

"Yes, Please." "是的，拜托了。"

"You set me up with Ikari didn't you?" Asuka asks with a narrow look. Hikari just smiles as a response. Huffing in disbelief. "Okay. ONLY, because I owe you one for teaching me that recipe." she says shaking her finger. Asuka not even looking to the boys grabs Hikari and starts walking. "Get a move on, Losers!"  
"你是不是把我跟碇配对了？" 明日香眯着眼问道。光只是微笑作为回应。明日香难以置信地哼了一声。"好吧。就这一次，因为我还欠你一个人情，你教了我那个食谱。"她说着，摇了摇手指。明日香甚至没看那些男生一眼，就拉着光开始走。"快点，你们这些家伙！"

Glancing back Asuka notices they haven't moved. "Schnell!" she hollers. Shinji just raises his finger and says, "Uh, aren't we waiting for Kensuke?".  
回头一看，明日香发现他们还没动。"快点！"她大声喊道。真嗣只是举起手指说："呃，我们不是在等洞木吗？"。

"He was invited, right?" adds Touji.  
"他也被邀请了，对吧？" 洞木补充道。

Asuka glances to Hikari and the look on her face says she just realized a flaw in her plan. Reluctantly Asuka put together an idea. "We can't wait any longer." Asuka says. "If he's running late we can just meet him there. Now MOVE!". They all start walking and Hikari jumps to Asuka hugging her around the neck.  
明日香瞥向光，脸上的表情显示她刚刚意识到计划中的一个漏洞。不情愿地，明日香拼凑出一个主意。“我们不能再等了。”明日香说，“如果他迟到了，我们可以在那里见他。现在，动起来！”他们开始走动，光跳起来抱住明日香的脖子。

They arrived at the arcade. It was just as amazing as everyone had heard. Tons of fighter, sims, drivers, dance, and grabber games. The four of them played a few of the multi player games together and even competed as couples in the dance simulator. Asuka and Shinji won easily despite Shinji tripping at a few steps. At one point Hikari tripped and fell right into Touji's arms. Asuka was suspicious if that really was an accident.  
他们到达了游戏厅。这里正如大家所传闻的那样令人惊叹。有大量的格斗、模拟、驾驶、舞蹈和抓取游戏。四人一起玩了几款多人游戏，甚至在舞蹈模拟器中以情侣身份竞争。尽管真嗣绊了几步，明日香和真嗣还是轻松获胜。有一次，光绊倒了，正好跌进东二的怀里。明日香怀疑那是否真的是意外。

"It's about lunch time." says Hikari. "Where do you all want to eat?"  
“差不多该吃午饭了。”光说，“你们都想在哪里吃？”

"I saw they have vending machines in here" says Touji. "Looked like nice stuff too."  
"我看到这里有自动售货机"，东治说，"看起来卖的东西也不错。"

Everyone agreed to this and walked back and bought their food from the machines. Sandwiches, onion rings, fries, and sodas. They sat outside under some shade and ate their meals. Everyone was pretty happy with the food, but Asuka. "_Shinji makes these boxed things better."_ she thinks.  
大家都同意了这个提议，走回去从机器里买了食物。三明治、洋葱圈、薯条和汽水。他们坐在外面阴凉处吃着饭。大家对食物都很满意，除了明日香。"真嗣做的便当比这些好吃多了。"她心想。

Once they were all about done with their meals Asuka and Hikari excused themselves to the bathroom. "Why do they always leave in packs?" asked Touji and Shinji just shrugged.  
"他们差不多吃完饭后，明日香和光起身去洗手间。"为什么她们总是一起行动？"东治问道，真嗣只是耸了耸肩。

"You having fun, Asuka?" "你在玩得开心吗，明日香？"

"Yeah, this has been a pretty nice date."  
"嗯，这真是个不错的约会。"

Hikari thinks, _"She called it a date."_. "Could I ask one more favor?" she says smiling and flashing puppy dog eyes. Asuka just stands in silence waiting for the penny to drop. Hikari, not hearing a no, continues, "Could you take Shinji so me and Suzuhara can be alone?"  
光想道：“她称之为约会。”她微笑着，眨着小狗般的眼睛说：“我能再请你帮个忙吗？”明日香只是静静地站着，等待着真相大白。光没有听到拒绝，便继续说：“你能带真嗣走吗，这样我和铃原就可以单独在一起了？”

"Alright." Asuka says rolling her eyes.  
"好吧。" 明日香说着，翻了个白眼。

The girls walked out freshened up. Before anyone could say much of anything Asuka grabbed Shinji by the wrist. She says, "Come on, Idiot. I want to play the grabbers.". She glances back and sees Hikari and Touji sitting and looking rather adorable. Asuka tried several times on the claw machine to catch this little red teddy bear. She loved it, because it was the same color as her Eva. It grabbed every time, but slipped from the claws grip. "Ach!" she hollered as it missed for the fifth time. "It's a freakin' jip! It's rigged!" She proceeded to start kicking it. Shinji just stood in silence as she has gathered a crowd from her outburst. "Can I try?" he asks.  
女孩们走出洗手间，精神焕发。还没等大家说什么，明日香就抓住了真嗣的手腕。她说："快点，笨蛋。我想玩抓娃娃机。"她回头一看，发现光和冬二正坐着，看起来相当可爱。明日香在抓娃娃机前试了好几次，想要抓到这只小红熊。她很喜欢它，因为它的颜色和她的 EVA 一样。每次都抓到了，但总是从爪子里滑落。"啊！"她大叫一声，第五次失败了。"这简直是骗人！这机器被操纵了！"她开始踢打机器。真嗣只是静静地站着，而她的爆发已经吸引了一群围观者。"我能试试吗？"他问道。

Asuka stands a side to give him a try. Shinji is very skilled and catches the red bear on the first try. He grabs it from the door and hands it to Asuka. "You can have it. It's too girlie for me." he says. She looks down to it and to Shinji. She smiles and take it from him. She slips it under her belt so she wont have to carry it. A game catches her eye. Laughing she grabs Shinji by his collar and pulls him to the robot fighter.  
明日香站到一边，让他试试。真嗣非常熟练，第一次尝试就抓住了红色小熊。他从出口处取出，递给明日香。"你可以留着它。对我来说太女孩子气了。"他说。她低头看了看小熊，又看了看真嗣。她微笑着接过小熊，把它塞进腰带里，这样就不用拿着了。一个游戏吸引了她的注意。她笑着抓住真嗣的衣领，把他拉向机器人格斗游戏。

They climb into the pilot seats. "Get ready for some punishment, maggot." Asuka laughs. They play several rounds. They even gather a small crowd to watch on the screen above. Asuka wins the first few matches. When Shinji won two she got frustrated. Something caught her eye about the way he was playing. She purposely left her guard open and noticed Shinji made no effort at all to attack. "What the hell do you think you're doing!" says Asuka. Shinji just looks surprised.  
他们爬进驾驶座。“准备好接受惩罚吧，小虫子。”明日香笑着说。他们玩了好几轮，甚至吸引了一小群人围观屏幕上的比赛。明日香赢了前几场比赛。当真嗣赢了两场时，她感到沮丧。她注意到他玩游戏的方式有些特别。她故意露出破绽，却发现真嗣根本没有攻击的意图。“你到底在搞什么鬼！”明日香说。真嗣只是显得很惊讶。

"Sorry." he says. He climbs out of the seat with the game still in progress. Asuka has already gotten out and is making her way to him. As soon as he gets out Asuka is standing there.  
“对不起。”他说着，从座位上爬出来，游戏还在进行中。明日香已经出来了，正朝他走来。他一出来，明日香就站在那里。

"You JERK!" she yells poking him in the chest. "You were going easy on me!"  
“你这个混蛋！”她大声喊道，用手指戳他的胸口。“你刚才在让我！”

"Just that once. I-I'm sorry I didn-" he stutters.  
"就那一次。我...对不起，我..." 他结巴着说。

"I don't need you to go easy on me, Third Child! Just… get out of my face! I hate you!" she pushes Shinji and runs past the gathered crowd, head down and very upset. Shinji collides with a machine and falls to the ground, his hat falling off.  
"我不需要你手下留情，第三适格者！只是…别在我面前晃悠！我讨厌你！" 她推开真嗣，低头穿过聚集的人群，显得非常难过。真嗣撞上一台机器，摔倒在地，帽子也掉了下来。

"Does she yell at you like that all the time?" asks someone behind him. Shinji climbs to his feet and sees who is talking.  
"她总是那样对你大吼大叫吗？" 身后有人问道。真嗣站起身来，看到了说话的人。

"Oh, You're Mana." says Shinji. Mana is wearing a white button up shirt and a short plaid skirt, a small bookbag slung around her shoulder. The girl smiles and hands Shinji his hat. He takes it from her. "Thanks."  
"哦，你是真名。" 真嗣说道。真名穿着一件白色纽扣衬衫和一条短格子裙，一个小书包斜挎在肩上。女孩微笑着递给真嗣他的帽子。他从她手中接过。"谢谢。"

"So does your girlfriend always treat you like that?"  
"那么，你的女朋友总是这样对你吗？"

"Yeah, but she's not my girlfriend." he looks to where Asuka had run off, but doesn't see her.  
"是的，但她不是我的女朋友。" 他望向明日香跑开的方向，但没有看到她。

"Oh." says Mana smiling. "I only asked, because I sort of know about being in a bad relationship." Shinji knows she is talking about that ball player. "I don't know if you know this, but I work for the school paper."  
"哦。" 真名微笑着说，"我只是问问，因为我多少了解糟糕的恋爱关系。" 真嗣知道她在说那个棒球运动员。"不知道你知不知道，我在校报工作。"

"Yeah, I heard." "嗯，我听说了。"

"Well, The school year is almost over and I'm planning a special year end edition. I'd love to get an interview with a pilot of the Eva." Mana says hopefully.  
"嗯，学年快结束了，我计划出一期特别的年终版。我很希望能采访到一位 Eva 驾驶员。" 真名满怀希望地说。

"Are you sure you wouldn't want to talk to the others?"  
"你确定不想和其他人谈谈吗？"

"I tried talking to Ayanami a while back. Before you came to town. Only thing she said was that she would only talk with me if she was ordered to. Weird, huh?"  
"我之前尝试和绫波说话，在你来镇上之前。她只说如果被命令才会和我说话。很奇怪吧？"

"There's Asuka." Shinji says pointing toward the direction she ran off.  
"那是明日香。" 真嗣指着她跑开的方向说道。

"Well, like most of the girls in school. I'm a little afraid of her." Mana says with a laugh. She reaches into her bag and pulls out a small card. "Here. This is my number. Give me a call and we can set up an interview."  
"嗯，就像学校里的大多数女生一样。我对她有点害怕。" 真奈笑着说。她伸手从包里拿出一张小卡片。"给。这是我的号码。给我打电话，我们可以安排一次采访。"

Shinji takes the card and says, "I'm not sure if I can. Lot of the stuff is classified and-"  
真嗣接过卡片，说："我不确定我能不能。很多东西都是机密的，而且——"

"Oh no." Mana interrupts. "I'm not looking for details about the robots or anything like that. I just want to know about the pilots. Who they are."  
"哦，不。" 真奈打断他。"我并不是想了解关于机器人或类似的东西的细节。我只是想了解那些驾驶员。他们是谁。"

"I'll have to ask. If they're okay with it I guess I could." He puts the card into his pocket and feels a sudden, sharp pull on his ear. He sees Asuka dragging him out the enterance and into the streets. She seems very upset. Once she has dragged him several blocks away she lets him go. Shaking in fury she spins to face him.  
"我得问问。如果他们同意，我想我可以。" 他将卡片放入口袋，突然感到耳朵一阵剧痛。他看到明日香正拽着他走出入口，来到街上。她看起来非常生气。拖着他走了几个街区后，她才放手。她气得发抖，转身面对他。

"Tell me right now!" she yells pointing to the ground. "What did you think you were doing?"  
"现在就告诉我！" 她指着地面大喊，"你刚才在想什么？"

"S-sorry." he stammers. "对-对不起。" 他结巴着说。

"STOP THAT! I don't need pity from anyone. Tell me now Shinji and don't you say 'Sorry'!" she says now pointing to him.  
"停下！我不需要任何人的怜悯。现在就告诉我，真嗣，还有，你不许说'对不起'！" 她指着他，语气坚决。

Shinji wants to tell her, but thinks, "_I can't tell her. I'll just make things worse."_. He just stands there looking to the ground and wont say anything.  
真嗣想要告诉她，但转念一想，"我不能说，只会让情况更糟。" 他只是站在那里，低头看着地面，一言不发。

Asuka looks like she doesn't know if she wants to scream or cry she is so upset. "You're such a coward." She storms off further into the city. "I can't even look at you. Just go home, Idiot. And don't follow me!"  
明日香看起来既想尖叫又想哭泣，她太难过了。"你真是个懦夫。" 她气冲冲地向城市深处走去。"我甚至不想看到你。回家去吧，傻瓜。别跟着我！"

Shinji just stands in place. She is three blocks away and he says, "I-I'm sorry.".  
真嗣只是站在原地。她离他三个街区远，他说道：“我……我很抱歉。”

It was a long slow walk home for Shinji. He thought about going to tell Hikari and Touji he was leaving, but he felt like he made Asuka angry enough. He didn't want to chance upsetting her more by disobeying her order. He walked into the apartment and was surprised how hot it was. It was warm outside, but it felt worse in here.  
对真嗣来说，回家的路漫长而缓慢。他想过要去告诉光和冬二他要离开，但他觉得自己已经让明日香够生气的了。他不想冒险违抗她的命令，以免让她更加不快。他走进公寓，惊讶地发现里面异常闷热。外面已经很暖和了，但屋里感觉更糟。

"I'm home." he called out.  
“我回来了。”他喊道。

"Hey Shin-chan." calls Misato from the balcony. Shinji walks in and see her sunning herself in a tight bikini, purple that barely coveres much of anything. Her skin has a sheen from the oil that covers every inch of her skin. Misato walks in and gives Shinji a hug. "Are you okay Shinji? Your shaking and the AC isn't working." Misato lets him go an she walks to the fridge. "Get this. The tech finally came to look at the conditioning for the building. He cut off all that cold air, but wouldn't you know. He didn't have all the parts to fix it. Now we have no cool air." Misato grabs herself a beer and sits at the table.  
"嘿，真嗣。" 美里从阳台上喊道。真嗣走进来，看到她穿着紧身的紫色比基尼，几乎遮不住什么，皮肤上因为涂满了油而闪闪发光。美里走进来给了真嗣一个拥抱。"你还好吗，真嗣？你在发抖，空调又坏了。" 美里放开他，走向冰箱。"听这个。技术人员终于来检查大楼的空调了。他把所有的冷气都切断了，但你知道吗，他没有所有需要的零件来修理。现在我们没有冷气了。" 美里给自己拿了一瓶啤酒，坐在桌旁。

She just now notices the look on his face. "Shin-chan, what's wrong?"  
她这才注意到他脸上的表情。"真嗣，怎么了？"

He sits down across from her and says, "I messed things up. Asuka's angry with me."  
他坐在她对面，说："我把事情搞砸了。明日香生我的气了。"

"_Damn, and things were going so well."_ she thinks.  
"该死，事情本来进展得挺顺利的。" 她心想。

"Oh, there was some girl from school. She wants to interview me. Not about the Eva's just about the pilots. Is that a problem?"  
"哦，是学校的一个女生。她想采访我。不是关于 Eva，只是关于驾驶员。这有问题吗？"

Misato sits thinking for a second. "I don't see why not. You can talk about yourselves, but nothing about NERV or the Evas."  
葛城美里坐下思考了一会儿。"我觉得没什么不可以。你们可以谈谈自己，但不要涉及 NERV 或 Eva。"

"Okay." "好的。"

"Oh, one more thing." she smile. "When you get to me be sure she spells my name right."  
"哦，还有一件事。" 她微笑着说，"当你提到我时，一定要确保她把我的名字拼写正确。"

Misato stayed in her bikini much to Shinji's frustration. He is too timid to look as he talks with her in fear he may begin to stare. The more drunk she got the more affectionate she became. "So Shinji. When did Asuka say she was coming home?" Shinji just shrugged his shoulders.  
尽管这让真嗣感到十分尴尬，但美里还是穿着比基尼。他太害羞了，不敢直视她，生怕自己会盯着她看。美里越喝越醉，也就越发放纵。"那么，真嗣，明日香说她什么时候回来？" 真嗣只是耸了耸肩。

Asuka came walking in the door a few hours later. She was carrying two shopping bags. Still frowning and rather upset. She ignored Shinji, but was shocked by Misato. Holding her tongue on what was on her mind she asked another question. "Why is it so hot in here now?"  
几个小时后，明日香拎着两个购物袋走了进来。她仍然皱着眉头，显得相当不高兴。她无视了真嗣，但对美里的打扮感到震惊。她忍住了心里的话，转而问道："为什么现在屋里这么热？"

Misato told her all about how the AC was no longer working. "Verdammt!" Asuka hollers stomping her foot. "It figures just when I go out and get some warmer clothes to sleep in." She storms into her room. Asuka drops her bags and notices the red teddy bear under her belt. She removes it and just stares at it. Gently petting it.  
碇真嗣告诉她空调已经坏了。"该死！"明日香跺着脚喊道，"我就知道，偏偏在我出去买了些更暖和的睡衣后。"她气冲冲地走进自己的房间。明日香放下袋子，注意到腰带下的红色泰迪熊。她把它取下来，只是凝视着它，轻轻地抚摸着。

"Why do I still have this?" She tosses it across her room and it hit's the wall. "Stupid, Shinji." She falls on her bed, hugs her pillow, and just lays till the sun starts to set.  
"为什么我还留着这个？"她把它扔到房间的另一头，撞到了墙上。"愚蠢的，真嗣。"她倒在床上，抱着枕头，就这样躺着直到太阳开始落山。

Misato ordered several pizzas for dinner. There was a meat lovers, for Asuka; an extra anchovy, for Pen-pen ; and a ham and pineapple for Shinji and herself. Shinji, on Misato's request, tried knocking on the door to tell Asuka dinner was here, but got no response. Asuka didn't come out until Misato called for her.  
美里为晚餐订了几份披萨。有给明日香的肉食者披萨；给企鹅的特制凤尾鱼披萨；还有给真嗣和自己准备的火腿菠萝披萨。在美里的要求下，真嗣试着敲门告诉明日香晚餐到了，但没有得到回应。直到美里叫她，明日香才出来。

Misato had changed into the same clothes she wore on the sleepover movie night, and Asuka walked out in the same tight shirt and small tight shorts. Asuka sat silently through dinner. Misato asked Shinji about his day. He tried very hard to avoid anything that had to do with the event at the arcade that made Asuka so upset. They weren't talking with each other so Misato engaged them seperately. She thought if they heard the other talk they might be more comfortable to talk.  
美里换上了和电影之夜一样的睡衣，明日香也穿着紧身 T 恤和短小的紧身短裤走了出来。明日香在晚餐期间一言不发。美里询问真嗣一天的情况。他极力避免提及任何与让明日香在游戏厅里不快的事件相关的话题。他们彼此不交谈，于是美里分别与他们交谈。她认为，如果他们听到对方说话，可能会更愿意开口。

Misato then brought up that they had to get plenty of sleep tonight for their synchronization tests that they had tomorrow. There was also talk about war games and battle simulations. Asuka seemed interested and would on occasion glare at Shinji. This behavior eventually got to Misato.  
随后，美里提到他们今晚必须好好休息，为明天的同步测试做准备。还谈到了战争游戏和战斗模拟。明日香似乎对此很感兴趣，不时地瞪向真嗣。这种行为最终引起了美里的注意。

"Asuka, is something wrong?" asks Misato.  
“明日香，有什么不对劲吗？”美里问道。

This seemed to hit the pressure valve on the red head. "I'm just sick!" Asuka says standing. Her resolve noticeably weakened as she glanced to Shinji for just a second before returning her eyes to Misato. "I'm sick of the 'Invincible Shinji' treating me like some weak child. He's a JERK."  
这话似乎触动了红发少女的压力阀。“我只是厌倦了！”明日香站起来说道，她的决心明显减弱，瞥了真嗣一眼后，目光又回到美里身上。“我厌倦了‘无敌的真嗣’把我当成弱小孩童。他就是个混蛋。”

Shinji looked like he was about to say something until Asuka regained that lost passion and said, "And I'm sick of you." Misato just sits confused as Asuka was now pointing to her. Shinji lost his thought and Misato had no idea what she has done. "You're always getting drunk and pawing all over him, going out with my Kaji, and dressing like some tramp."  
真嗣本想说什么，但明日香重燃激情，说道：“我也厌倦了你。”美里一脸困惑地坐着，因为明日香现在正指着她。真嗣的话被打断，美里也不明白自己做了什么。“你总是喝得烂醉，对他动手动脚，和我的加持出去，还打扮得像个荡妇。”

"_She does realize she's wearing the same stuff?"_ Misato asks herself.  
“她难道没意识到自己穿得也一样吗？”美里自问。

Asuka pointing to Shinji who sits quietly as Asuka vents. "Don't you know how impressionable this idiot is?"  
明日香指着静静坐着的真嗣，发泄道：“你不知道这个笨蛋有多容易受影响吗？”

"Hey! I wasn-" was all Shinji was able to say before-  
“嘿！我并—”真嗣刚要辩解，就被—

"Aggh!" Asuka yells, storms into her room, and slams the door behind her. Misato and Shinji just sit in silence.  
"“啊！”明日香大叫一声，冲进自己的房间，砰地一声关上门。美里和真嗣只是默默地坐着。”

Confused Misato walks into her room. Shinji reaches into his pocket and pulls out the card with Mana's number. He picks up the phone and sits at the dinner table. His hand shaking he dials the number. The phone rings a personalized tone. A few seconds later the line is answered. "H-hello. Is Mana there?"  
困惑的葛城美里走进自己的房间。真嗣伸手从口袋里掏出写着玛娜号码的卡片。他拿起电话，坐在餐桌旁。手微微颤抖着，他拨通了号码。电话响起了一串个性化的铃声。几秒钟后，电话被接听了。“喂，请问玛娜在吗？”

"Oh, hi." “哦，嗨。”

"I talked with my guardian and she say's it's alright."  
“我和我的监护人谈过了，她说没问题。”

"We just can't say anything about NERV or the Evas."  
"我们对 NERV 或 EVA 的事情什么都不能说。"

"I'm not sure." "我不确定。"

"Okay." "好的。"

"When do you want to do this?"  
"你想什么时候做这件事？"

"No. Not tomorrow. We have some tests and I'm not sure if there will be anything else."  
"不，不是明天。我们有些测试，我不确定是否还有其他事情。"

"Monday is fine." "周一可以。"

"Where?" "在哪里？"

"I guess. The ice-cream shop on Main Street? I know where that is."  
"我猜吧。主街上的冰淇淋店？我知道那地方。"

"Yeah that's good." "嗯，挺好的。"

"I-I'm not sure." "我...我不太确定。"

"Maybe." "或许吧。"

"See you then." "那到时候见。"

Shinji hangs up the line. He starts to get up and notices that Asuka's door is slightly ajar. He tries to look into the dark room from where he is standing, but the door suddenly slams shut. He looks to the door and mumbles. "I'm sorry, Asuka. You're not weak...I am."  
真嗣挂断电话，起身时注意到明日香的房门微微开着。他试图从站立的位置窥视昏暗的房间，但门突然砰地一声关上了。他望向房门，喃喃自语：“对不起，明日香。你并不软弱...软弱的是我。”

A/N: Yet again another LONG chapter. To tell you the truth this chapter was designed to be twice as long. These scenes were just too good to let them slide by with little description. This chapter was going to have a rather shocking end, but I'm going to save that for the next chapter. How's that for a tease? There is a small bit of fan service in this chapter.  
作者的话：又是另一个超长的章节。说实话，这一章原本设计是现在的两倍长。这些场景实在太精彩了，不容草率描述。本章原本打算有一个相当震撼的结尾，但我打算留到下一章。这样吊胃口如何？这一章还有一点粉丝福利。

I always look forward to reviews. I like to hear questions from people. Just so you know. Just about everything is plotted out. Just because one chapter doesn't explain something doesn't mean you wont get an answer by the end.  
我总是期待着评论。我喜欢听到人们的疑问。提前告诉你，几乎所有情节都已规划好。即使某一章没有解释某些事情，也不意味着最后你不会得到答案。

You got to feel sorry for Shinji in that last chapter. Pour guy didn't even know he was on a date. Sounds unfair to me.  
你得为上一章的碇真嗣感到难过。可怜的家伙甚至不知道自己在约会。对我来说，这听起来太不公平了。

**Chapter 5: The Katsuragi Scenario  
第五章：葛城计划**

By five in the morning, Misato very reluctantly dragged herself out of bed. She had a splitting headache. Grumbling as she pulled herself to her feet, and wondered what happened to her shirt. She seriously considered that her friend, Ritsuko, scheduled these sychrinization tests this early on the weekends just to torture her. It was raining outside. The clouds blocking the first signs of daylight. Misato thanked heaven for small favors. She took a deep cleansing breath as she braced herself on the dressers. When her eyes opened she saw her fathers cross. He was far from an idol father, but when it came to it he sacrificed himself to save her.  
早上五点，葛城极其不情愿地从床上爬起来。她头痛欲裂。一边嘟囔着，一边挣扎着站起来，纳闷自己的衬衫去哪儿了。她严重怀疑她的朋友，律子，故意把同步测试安排在周末这么早的时间，就是为了折磨她。外面下着雨，乌云遮住了黎明的第一缕曙光。葛城庆幸还有这点小确幸。她深吸一口气，扶着梳妆台站稳。当她睁开眼睛时，看到了父亲的十字架。他绝非理想的父亲，但关键时刻，他牺牲了自己来救她。

Her conflicting emotions were obruptly ended as the sounds of cooking in the kitchen caught her attention. Her thoughts now started to wonder on the events of the other night. Misato came out of her room a short time after Asuka's rather confusing outburst. Shinji was on his feet and looking to Asuka's door.  
厨房里传来的烹饪声突然打断了她复杂的情绪。她的思绪开始转向前一晚的事件。在明日香那场令人困惑的发泄之后不久，葛城走出了房间。真嗣已经站了起来，目光投向明日香的房门。

"Shin-chan," Misato said. "Who were you talking to?"  
"新酱，" 美里问道，"你在和谁说话呢？"

"That girl from the school paper. Asked her when she wants to do that interview."  
"就是校报的那个女生。我问她什么时候做那个采访。"

"Shinji" she said in surprise. "Did you just ask a girl out on a date?"  
"真嗣，" 她惊讶地说，"你刚才是不是约女孩子出去约会了？"

"No." he replies flatly. "We're just meeting at the ice cream place to talk."  
"不。" 他平淡地回答，"我们只是在冰淇淋店见面谈谈。

"Sounds like a date to me." Misato sang as she walked to the fridge to claim her next beer.  
"听起来像约会呢。" 美里边唱边走向冰箱拿下一瓶啤酒。

"Just drop it." Shinji snapped back. The anger in his tone caught Misato off guard. She helped Shinji gather up the glasses and empty pizza boxes. She thought about asking him for more details of what happened that day, but thought it probably best to let both of the teens decompress. Asuka only came out of her room a handful of times. Only to go to the bathroom, fridge, or claim the phone to take back into her room.  
"别提了。" 真嗣厉声回道。他语气中的怒意让美里措手不及。她帮真嗣收拾起玻璃杯和空披萨盒。她本想询问那天到底发生了什么，但考虑到最好还是让两个年轻人先冷静下来。明日香只是偶尔从房间出来几次，仅限于去洗手间、冰箱或拿电话回房间。

Last night was certainly interesting. Misato straightened herself, found her shirt, took another deep breath, and walked through her door.  
昨晚确实挺有意思的。葛城整了整衣服，找到自己的衬衫，深吸一口气，然后穿过了房门。

"Good morning, Misato." Shinji says in a cheery morning tone.  
“早上好，葛城。” 碇真嗣用一种愉快的早晨语气说道。

"Mmm, Morning." she replies. Blinded for a second as her eyes adjusted to the lights. Misato made her way to the fridge and collected a beer. She sat down and took a deep chug from her can. "YEEAAAHHHH!" Misato hollers and slams down her beer. "That smells soooooo good, Shinji. What are you cooking?"  
“嗯，早。” 她回答道。眼睛适应光线时眼前一黑，葛城走向冰箱拿了一瓶啤酒。她坐下来，从罐子里大口喝了一口。“耶——！”葛城大喊一声，砰地放下啤酒。“闻起来太香了，真嗣，你在煮什么？”

"Stuffed French toast." "法式吐司夹心。"

"_Asuka's favorite. Trying to earn some points huh?"_ Misato thought. "You didn't have to get up early to cook. We have some pizza left over." Shinji just gave Misato a disturbed look. "What! Cold pizza and beer make a great breakfast. I'd even let you have some beer." Misato spoke with a playful tone.  
"明日香的最爱。想赚点好感分吗？" 美里心想。"你不必早起做饭。我们还有剩下的披萨。" 真嗣只是给了美里一个困扰的眼神。"什么！冷披萨和啤酒是绝佳的早餐。我甚至可以让你喝点啤酒。" 美里带着调皮的语气说道。

"I can't." "我不行。"

"Why not." She says waving her beer to tempt the boy. "Just a sip."  
"为什么不呢。" 她挥动着手中的啤酒，诱惑着那个男孩。"就尝一小口。"

"I'm a minor." "我还未成年。"

"Ah, I thought teens are suppose to rebel." she says in mock disappointment.  
"啊，我以为青少年应该会叛逆呢。" 她带着戏谑的失望说道。

"I am." Shinji says with a cute smile. They share a short laugh.  
"我就是。" 真嗣带着可爱的微笑说道。他们短暂地笑了起来。

"I take it Asuka's not up yet."  
"看来明日香还没起床呢。"

"No." he says going back to the cooking.  
"是的。" 他说着继续回去烹饪。

"I'll get her." Misato gets up and slowly slides open the door. "Asuka, you up?" Misato says softly. Not getting a reply she walks into the lions den. She sees Asuka under the covers, feet exposed, clutching a red and white teddy bear. Misato was about to place her hand on Asuka when she suddenly started to mumble something in her sleep. "Lass mich doch… nicht,… Shinji." mumbles Asuka. Misato is confused by everything, but the last word. She had worked for NERV's German branch years ago, but was far out of practice in her German. _"If you don't use it every day."_ Misato thinks in frustration. She stands there watching over the lovely red-head and considers letting her continue this dream. She had to get up though or they would be late.  
"我去叫她。" 碇真嗣站起身，缓缓拉开房门。"明日香，你醒了吗？" 他轻声问道。没有得到回应，他走进了房间。他看到明日香蜷缩在被子里，脚露在外面，紧抱着一只红白相间的泰迪熊。碇真嗣正要伸手去碰她，突然她开始在睡梦中喃喃自语。"别管我……不要，……真嗣。" 明日香喃喃道。碇真嗣对这一切感到困惑，但最后一个词他听懂了。他曾在 NERV 的德国分部工作多年，但德语已经很久不用，生疏了许多。"如果不用，就会忘。" 碇真嗣懊恼地想。他站在那里，守望着这位可爱的红发少女，考虑是否让她继续这个梦境。但他必须叫醒她，否则他们会迟到。

She gently placed her hand on Asuka's shoulder and rocked the girl. "Aaaasuka." She softly says. "Asuka, it's time to get up."  
她轻轻地将手放在明日香的肩膀上，摇晃着她。"明日香。" 她温柔地说。"明日香，该起床了。"

Asuka's eyes slowly open and tries to adjust to the dark room. "Morgen." She says with a week smile.  
明日香的眼睛缓缓睁开，试图适应昏暗的房间。"早上好。" 她带着一丝虚弱的微笑说道。

"That's a really cute bear." says Misato. "Is that new?"  
"那真是一只很可爱的熊。" 美里说道，"是新买的吗？"

Asuka looks surprised by the question, but even more so as she looks to the bear in her arms. "Did you put this is my bed?" she asks.  
明日香对这个问题感到惊讶，但当她看向怀中的熊时，惊讶更甚。"是你把它放在我床上的吗？" 她问道。

"No. You were hugging it when I came in." Misato answers. "You need to get up. You can have the bathroom first. We need to leave before six if we want to get there in time." Misato walks out, softly closing the door, and leaving Asuka looking to her red bear.  
"不，我进来时你正抱着它。" 美里回答，"你得起床了。你可以先用洗手间。如果我们想准时到达，六点前就得出发。" 美里轻轻关上门走了出去，留下明日香看着她的红色小熊。

Asuka came out of her room a minute after Misato left. Stretching her arms and yawning. Shinji greeted her as she walks past him and to the bathroom. She just gives him the same German morning greeting, she gave Misato, as she rubs her eyes.  
明日香在美里离开后一分钟走出了房间，伸了个懒腰，打了个哈欠。当她经过真嗣走向浴室时，真嗣向她打招呼。她只是用同样给美里的德语早安问候回应，同时揉了揉眼睛。

Misato had finished her breakfast and was talking casually with Shinji by the time Asuka exited the bathroom. Misato walked to the bathroom door and watched as Asuka sat down to breakfast. She seemed very happy with the breakfast, pouring on syrup and powdered sugar. The two sat silently at the table eating and Misato just crossed her fingers hoping this ceasefire would hold by the time they left.  
当明日香从浴室出来时，美里已经吃完早餐，正与真嗣闲聊。美里走到浴室门口，看着明日香坐下来吃早餐。她似乎对早餐非常满意，倒上糖浆和糖粉。两人默默地在桌旁用餐，美里只是交叉手指，希望这种停战状态能在他们离开时保持。

Wishes do come true. Shinji and Asuka may not of been overflowing with emotions to each other, but they were courteous. Misato went from hung over to all business when they left for NERV in Misato's car. Asuka sat in the back trying to get a few more moments rest, and Shinji just sat quietly looking out the window. Misato had to fill the silence with the radio.  
愿望确实会实现。真嗣和明日香对彼此可能没有溢于言表的情感，但他们彼此彬彬有礼。当他们乘坐美里的车前往 NERV 时，美里从宿醉状态转为公事公办。明日香坐在后座试图多休息一会儿，而真嗣则静静地望着窗外。美里不得不打开收音机来填补沉默。

The stoic Rei was just arriving as they did. "Morning, Rei." calls out Misato.  
当他们到达时，冷静的绫波丽也刚好出现。“早上好，绫波。” 美里喊道。

Rei stopped to return the greeting. "Good morning, Major Katsuragi. Pilot Ikari. Pilot Soryu." Shinji was cheerful as he talked with Rei and Asuka was closer to indifferent. Misato escorted the chosen through the halls of NERV till they reached their cross roads. "Well, you kids get ready. I need to go find Ritsuko and tell her we're here." says Misato.  
绫波停下脚步回应问候。“早上好，葛城少校。碇真嗣驾驶员。惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员。” 真嗣与绫波交谈时显得兴致勃勃，而明日香则更接近于漠不关心。美里带领着他们穿过 NERV 的走廊，直到他们到达各自的岔路口。“好了，你们准备一下。我需要去找律子，告诉她我们到了。” 美里说。

The tests were well into an hour before they were done. Ritsuko, Misato, and Maya were sitting in the test observation room. The screens showed all the children and their synch rations. Maya typed on her laptop to record the data. Ritsuko leaned over her shoulder to examine.  
测试进行了一个多小时才结束。律子、美里和玛雅坐在测试观察室内。屏幕上显示着所有孩子及其同步率。玛雅在她的笔记本电脑上打字记录数据。律子俯身在她肩上仔细查看。

"How's the results?" asks Misato.  
"结果怎么样？" 问美里。

"Rei is up this week by about two points. Asuka and Shinji are both down three." says Maya.  
"这周绫波上升了大约两个百分点。明日香和真嗣都下降了三个百分点。" 玛雅说。

"Is that a problem?" asks Misato.  
"这有问题吗？" 美里问。

"I don't think it's too much to be concerned about just yet." says Ritsuko. She picks up her clipboard and makes several notes. She puts down her clipboard, and groans as she rubs her neck. "Is there any coffee left?"  
"我觉得现在就担心可能还为时尚早。" 丽津子说道。她拿起夹板，做了几笔记录。放下夹板，她揉着脖子呻吟道："还有咖啡吗？"

"Yeah." Misato says. She makes her way to the table to get her friend a cup. "Maya you want some?"  
"有的。" 美里说。她走向桌子，为朋友倒了一杯。"真矢，你要来点吗？"

"No thanks, Major." she replies.  
"不用了，少校。" 她回答道。

Misato returns with the coffee and hands it to a great full Ritsuko. "Mmmm, Thanks." she says and takes a slow sip.  
碇真嗣带着咖啡回来了，递给感激不尽的律子。“嗯，谢谢。”她说着，慢慢地啜了一口。

"I don't see how you can drink that stuff black." says a disturbed Misato.  
“我真不明白你怎么能喝得下这种黑咖啡。”真嗣有些困扰地说。

"I don't get how you can drink beer first thing in the morning." They both walk up to the table and Misato pours herself a cup of coffee, adding sugar and double cream. Ritsuko is surprised she didn't get any remark back on her comment. "So, how are things with your cupid impersonation."  
“我也不明白你怎么一大早就喝啤酒。”两人走到桌前，真嗣给自己倒了一杯咖啡，加了糖和双份奶油。律子惊讶她没有对她的评论做出任何回应。“那么，你扮演丘比特的事情进展如何了？”

"Things were going pretty well, but they had some argument and now… I don't know." says Misato and she sits at the edge of the table.  
"事情本来进展得挺顺利，但他们发生了争执，现在……我也不清楚。" 说着，美里坐到了桌子边上。

"Well, tampering in teenage hormones isn't easy."  
"唉，年轻人的荷尔蒙可不是那么好对付的。"

"I think they just need a little time apart to cool down." Misato taps her nails on the table and comes up with a plan. "You have any plans today?"  
"我觉得他们只是需要一点分开的时间冷静一下。" 美里敲着指甲，想出了一个计划。"你今天有什么安排吗？"

"No. Just need to get this test done, then I'm going home." Ritsuko says. "Why?"  
"不，只是需要完成这个测试，然后我就回家了。" 律子说道，"怎么了？"

"I think I have an idea. Call the kids in. I need to find Kaji."  
"我想我有个主意。叫孩子们进来。我需要找到加持。"

"Okay, but I'm timing you." Ritsuko says, implying something improper.  
"好吧，但我会给你计时的。" 律子说，暗示着某种不当之事。"

"Oh Shut Up!" yells Misato as she runs out of the room.  
"哦，闭嘴！" 美里一边喊着，一边跑出了房间。

Ritsuko smiles as she sips her coffee. "Maya, call them in please."  
律子微笑着啜饮咖啡，"真嗣，请他们进来吧。"

Maya gives the kids the all clear and the orders to report to the observation room. All three reported and Ritsuko told them the results. Asuka was upset from the drop in her test results. Once dismissed she briskly walked from the room. "Asuka, don't be like that." Shinji called after her.  
真嗣向孩子们发出一切正常的信号，并命令他们前往观察室。三人全部报到后，律子向他们通报了结果。明日香因为测试成绩下降而感到不快。被解散后，她快步走出了房间。"明日香，别这样。" 真嗣在她身后喊道。

She was upset as she made her way to the lockers. She was heading back to Misato's car when someone called her from behind. "Hey, Asuka! Wait up!"  
她心情不佳地走向储物柜。正要返回碇真嗣的车时，有人从后面叫住了她。“嘿，明日香！等等！”

Misato was running up from behind Asuka. They met up and started walking again. "I just left Ritsuko. We're going out for some fun and then lunch. Want to join us?" asks Misato.  
碇真嗣从后面追上了明日香。两人汇合后继续前行。“我刚和律子分开。我们打算出去玩玩，然后吃午饭。想加入我们吗？”碇真嗣问道。

"Sure." says Asuka. She suddenly stops in her tracks. "Is Shinji coming?"  
“当然。”明日香说。她突然停下脚步。“碇真嗣也来吗？”

"Nope." Misato says with a smile. "It's more of a girl's day. In fact I need to go tell Shinji we're going out. I'll meet you back at the car." Misato started to run back into NERV HQ. "I need to go take care of that and find Rei."  
"不，" 葛城美里微笑着说，"这是女生的日子。事实上，我得去告诉真嗣我们要出门了。我会在车上和你们会合。" 葛城美里开始跑回 NERV 总部。"我得去处理一下，还要找零。

Asuka walks quietly. Her mood improved by the idea of a day out with grown women. She goes to Misato's car. She climbs into the back seat to lay down and grab a few more moments rest.  
明日香静静地走着。与成熟女性共度一天的想法让她的心情好转。她走向葛城美里的车，爬进后座躺下，抓住片刻的休息。

The rain had stopped. The sky was bright and clear. The only way you could tell it had rained was from the damp soil and patches of moister on the roads. Shinji walked in rather tired from the boring train ride home. The house was no longer so hot. He only guessed that the tech had finally repaired the apartments air conditioning. He walked in and was greeted by a qwarking sound. Pen-pen was sitting in a beanbag watching the TV that Misato had left on for him. Shinji grabbed a melon freezer pop and soda. He took a seat next to Pen-pen. They watched TV for about forty minutes and Shinji fell asleep.  
雨已经停了，天空明亮而清澈。唯一能看出下过雨的痕迹是湿润的土壤和路面上的一些水迹。真嗣拖着疲惫的步伐从无聊的火车旅程中回到家。屋里不再那么闷热，他猜想是技术人员终于修好了公寓的空调。他走进屋，被一声嘎嘎声迎接。企鹅彭彭正坐在豆袋椅上，看着葛城美里为它留下的电视。真嗣拿了一根西瓜冰棒和汽水，坐在彭彭旁边。他们一起看了大约四十分钟的电视，然后真嗣睡着了。

He woke a few hours later and looked to the clock. It was nearly lunch time. He was just getting to his feet as the door bell rang. "Coming." he said. Opening the door he saw Kaji. He had his usual sly smile, but he also had a bandage wrapped twice around his head.  
几小时后他醒来，看了一眼时钟，快到午餐时间了。他刚站起身，门铃就响了。“来了。”他说道。打开门，他看到了薰。他带着一贯的狡黠微笑，但头上还缠了两圈绷带。

"Hey, Shinji." Kaji says with a cheerful wave. "Katsuragi here?"  
“嘿，真嗣。”薰挥手打招呼，语气欢快。“葛城在这里吗？”

"No. Her and Asuka left. I don't know when they'll be back."  
“不在。她和明日香出去了。我不知道她们什么时候回来。”

Kaji didn't seem surprised or at all disappointed by this. "Oh well. Why don't you come join me for lunch? My treat."  
卡吉似乎对此并不感到惊讶，也没有丝毫失望。“哦，好吧。不如你来和我一起吃午饭吧？我请客。”

He thinks, "_He knows I'm a boy right?"_ "I don't know-"  
他心想，“他知道我是男生吧？”“我不清楚——”

"Come now." says Kaji cutting him off. "You can't eat by yourself. It's bad for the digestion."  
“来吧。”卡吉打断他，说道，“你不能一个人吃饭。这对消化不好。”

Shinji thinks for a second and says, "Okay. Just let me feed Pen-pen." Kaji walks in behind Shinji. Shinji sets out some fish for Pen-pen to eat.  
真嗣想了一下，说道：“好的，让我先喂一下企鹅。”加持跟在真嗣后面走了进来。真嗣拿出一些鱼给企鹅吃。

"So Shinji," says Kaji. "how's life living with two beautiful women?"  
“那么，真嗣，”加持说，“和两位美女同住的生活怎么样？”

Shinji stands up and sees Kaji peaking into Misato's room. "Confusing." Shinji says. Shinji closes the door slowly almost catching Kaji's nose.  
真嗣站起来，看到加持正往美里房间里偷看。“挺复杂的。”真嗣说。他慢慢关上门，差点夹到加持的鼻子。

"I bet." says Kaji laughing. He slips his arm over Shinji shoulder and holds him like a life long friend.  
"我敢打赌。" 薰笑着说。他伸手搭在真嗣的肩上，像老朋友一样搂着他。

"Uh, Kaji." Shinji says looking to the bandages wrapped over Kaji's brow. "What happened to your head?"  
"呃，薰。" 真嗣看着薰额头上的绷带问道，"你的头怎么了？"

Kaji rubs his head embarrassed. He chuckles and says, "Oh, this? Well, I had my seat pulled out from under me." Shinji just knew he must of said something to Misato.  
薰尴尬地摸了摸头，笑着说："哦，这个啊？嗯，我被人从座位上拉下来了。" 真嗣心想他肯定又对美里说了什么。

They walk out the door and Kaji asks him what he is in mood to eat. They get into Kaji's car and drive into Tokyo-3.  
他们走出门口，加持问他想吃什么。两人上了加持的车，驶向第三新东京市。

People of the city were all about. The sun just seemed to improve everyone's mood. Asuka, Ritsuko, Misato and Rei traveled through the city shops. While most of the girls laughed and joked. Rei was mostly just… there. She asked a few questions, and everyone tried to be helpful. The only question none of them wanted to touch was when they went into a lingerie store and Rei asked, "Why would someone want underwear with a hole down the middle?" After a few awkward moments Asuka was the one who made a comment. She said, "Only perverts want that crap.". Misato tried to hide that her face had gone suddenly red.  
城市里的人们熙熙攘攘。阳光似乎提升了每个人的心情。明日香、律子、美里和零在城市商店间穿梭。大多数女孩都在笑闹，而零则大多只是……在场。她问了几个问题，大家都尽量帮忙解答。唯有一个问题，当她们走进一家内衣店时，零问道：“为什么有人会想要中间有洞的内裤？”几秒钟尴尬的沉默后，明日香是那个打破僵局的人。她说：“只有变态才想要那种东西。”美里则试图掩饰自己突然涨红的脸。

Asuka probably had the most fun she had ever had with Rei. In one store she tried to put together a whole new look for Rei. The whole lot of them tried on far more then they actually bought. Asuka bought some shirts, a skirt, some hair bows, and a new bra and panty set that she thought was more grown up. At least as grown up as Misato would allow. Ritsuko bought a new skirt and watch. Misato purchased some jeans, and a couple tops. Rei bought two books, a note pad, pens, and was practically ordered to buy herself some new clothes. She picked a modest blouse and skirt. Asuka just rolled her eyes and said she looks like a teacher.  
明日香可能与绫波共度的时光最为愉快。在一家店里，她尝试为绫波打造全新造型。她们试穿的衣服远超实际购买的数量。明日香买了几件衬衫、一条裙子、几个发饰，以及一套她认为更显成熟的内衣。至少是在美里允许的成熟范围内。律子买了一条新裙子和一块手表。美里购入了几条牛仔裤和几件上衣。绫波买了两本书、一个笔记本、几支笔，并几乎是被命令着为自己添置了新衣。她挑选了一件朴素的衬衫和裙子。明日香只是翻了个白眼，说她看起来像个老师。

As lunch time came around, but none of them could settle on a single place to eat. The winner was picked through a game of Janken. Ritsuko was the winner. They sat down to a nice Italian style bistro. The women chatted about movies, music, and how sick they were of the news being obsessed with certain celebrities lives. Only real confrontation happened when Misato caught Asuka trying to sneak a piece of bacon into Rei's salad. Ritsuko also berated Misato for how much she was drinking in front of the children, and the fuss put up when Misato found out they had a drink limit.  
午餐时间到了，但他们却难以决定去哪家餐厅。最终通过猜拳游戏选出了胜者，获胜者是律子。他们坐进了一家氛围不错的意大利风格小餐馆。女士们聊起了电影、音乐，以及对新闻媒体过度关注某些名人生活的厌倦。唯一的小冲突发生在美里发现明日香试图偷偷将一片培根放进绫波的沙拉里。律子还责备美里在孩子面前喝太多酒，而当美里发现餐厅有饮酒限制时，又引起了一阵小骚动。

They walked around to burn those calories, and enjoy the sun. Misato was lagging behind with Rei. They were on Main Street when Asuka stopped in front of a store with outdoor tables. She glanced around the street as if she was looking for something. "Hey, let's get some ice cream here." she said. Everyone agreed, but it was Rei who noticed Asuka's unusual interest in this place.  
他们四处走走，消耗卡路里，享受阳光。美里和绫波落在后面。当他们走在主街上时，明日香突然停在一家有户外座位的商店前。她环顾街道，似乎在寻找什么。“嘿，我们在这儿买点冰淇淋吧。”她说。大家都同意了，但注意到明日香对这个地方异常感兴趣的却是绫波。

Asuka got a triple scoop of watermelon sorbet in a cup, Ritsuko bought peach ice cream, Misato chose a personal banana split with extra strawberries, and Rei selected vanilla ice cream with chopped nuts in a waffle cone. Misato had lost a bit of her composer, and was often finding herself getting glaring looks from Ritsuko as she told some stories of her past.  
明日香点了杯装的三球西瓜冰沙，律子买了桃子冰淇淋，美里则选了加量草莓的个人香蕉船，而零选择了华夫筒装香草冰淇淋配碎坚果。美里似乎有些失态，经常发现自己因为讲述过去的某些故事而遭到律子瞪视。

"So, I told Kaji." Misato says. "If you're not hitting on women when you talk. You'd be a mime." Everyone laughed, but Rei who just smiled.  
“所以，我跟薰说。”美里说道，“如果你说话时不再对女性调情，那你干脆做个哑剧演员算了。”大家都笑了，除了零，她只是微微一笑。

"You know. I hear you go on a lot about the past, but I don't think it's as bad as you say." says Ritsuko. "In fact. I don't remember you doing a whole lot of complaining at the time." Misato just glared at her friend and then smiled  
“你知道吗，我听你老提过去的事，但我觉得没你说的那么糟。”律子说，“事实上，我不记得你当时有那么多抱怨。”美里瞪了她的朋友一眼，然后笑了。

"Okay. He's alright." Misato clenches her fists in frustration and says, "Just GOD. He could be such a jerk.".  
"好吧。他没事。" 惣流握紧拳头，一脸懊恼地说，"只是上帝啊。他有时候真是个混蛋。"

Asuka raised her hand as if she was to testify in court. "All men are pigs. Plain and simple." she says. Misato giggled.  
明日香举起手，仿佛要在法庭上作证。"所有男人都是猪。简单明了。" 她说道。惣流咯咯地笑了。

"I don't think all men are pigs." says Rei. Everyone glanced to Rei.  
"我不认为所有男人都是猪。" 绫波说道。大家都看向了绫波。

Asuka says flatly, "Name one.".  
明日香平淡地说：“举个例子。”

"Shinji Ikari." “碇真嗣。”

"Oh PLEASE." says Asuka almost laughing. "That idiot is like… King Pig. Did you know he even admitted trying to kiss me in my sleep?"  
“哦，拜托。”明日香几乎笑出声来，“那个笨蛋就像是……猪王。你知道吗，他甚至承认过试图在我睡着时吻我。”

"No." says Rei, more interested in her cone.  
"不。" 绫波更专注于她的蛋卷冰淇淋。

Asuka glared at Rei. "You like him don't you."  
明日香瞪着绫波。"你是不是喜欢他。"

"Yes, I do like him."  
"是的，我的确喜欢他。"

Asuka's eyes were now boring a hole into Rei. "Do you love him?"  
明日香的目光此刻正紧紧盯着绫波。“你爱他吗？”

There was a short silence as they all waited for Rei's response. "I don't know…" was all Rei said.  
短暂的沉默中，大家都在等待绫波的回答。“我不知道……”绫波只说了这么一句。

Misato saw the look of death in Asuka's eyes. She thought it best to step in. "Asuka, don't you think you're being a little unfair to Shin-chan?" Misato said, deflecting Asuka's attention. "Can you honestly tell me Shinji is the biggest pig you know?"  
美里察觉到明日香眼中的杀意，觉得最好介入一下。“明日香，你不觉得对真嗣有点不公平吗？”美里说道，转移了明日香的注意力。“你能诚实地告诉我，真嗣是你认识的最大猪头吗？”

Asuka went into thought. Several names popped into mind with little effort. Suzuhara, Aida, and about twenty other boys from school. The list in her mind just seem to pile on and on until she gave up. "Okay. Maybe he isn't 'King', but he's definitely in the top five." she lies.  
明日香陷入了沉思。几个名字轻而易举地浮现在脑海中：铃原、相田，还有学校里大约二十个其他男生。她脑海中的名单似乎越积越多，直到她放弃。“好吧，也许他不是‘国王’，但他绝对是前五名之一。”她撒了个谎。

"I always thought he was a rather sweet child." says Ritsuko.  
“我一直觉得他是个相当可爱的孩子。”律子说道。

"Huh?" says Asuka and Misato. Rei just glances to Ritsuko.  
“嗯？”明日香和美里同时说道。绫波只是瞥了一眼律子。

"I met him once as a child." Ritsuko says. "I also met his mother a few times."  
"我小时候见过他一次。" 律子说道，"他的母亲我也见过几次。"

"Really, Ritsu?" says Misato. "I never knew that."  
"真的吗，律子？" 美里说，"我从来不知道这事。"

"What was she like? Shinji's mother." Asuka asked.  
"她是个什么样的人？真嗣的母亲。" 明日香问道。"

"Well, I didn't get to really 'know' her all too well before she died. I guess the only thing I could really say about her was that… she was a good mother." Ritsuko looks into Asuka eyes. She thinks, "_You two share more then you know."_.  
"嗯，在她去世之前，我并没有真正深入了解她。我想我能说的关于她的事情就是……她是个好母亲。" 律子注视着明日香的眼睛，心想，"你们俩之间的共同点比你想象的要多。"

"Too bad Maya couldn't join us." says Misato to Ritsuko.  
"真可惜，玛雅没能和我们一起来。" 美里对律子说。

"Yeah, her shift doesn't end till two." Ritsuko picks up a sealed cup of ice cream. "I'm taking her this little treat before I head home."  
"是啊，她的班要到两点才结束。" 律子拿起一杯密封的冰淇淋，"我打算在回家前给她带这个小甜点。

It was Asuka who spoke next. "Misato. I want to apologize about last night. Calling you a tramp."  
接下来开口的是明日香。“美里，我想为昨晚的事道歉。说你是荡妇。”

Misato cut her off by resting her hand on her shoulder. "It's all forgiven. Let's just move on."  
美里用手搭在她的肩上打断了她。“一切都已原谅。我们继续前进吧。”

"Anyways, it's not like she was wrong." says Ritsuko.  
“不管怎样，她说的也没错。”律子说道。

Asuka laughs and Misato raises her banana split as if she was about to throw it. "Oh, so you want to wear this?" says Misato. The mood improved notably after that. The girls shared jokes and stupid stories. Asuka was incredibly frustrated by her inability make Rei even giggle. She was able to make Rei blush by whispering something into her ear. Both Misato and Ritsuko were not sure they even wanted to know what Asuka had said.  
明日香笑了起来，而美里则举起她的香蕉船，仿佛要扔出去似的。“哦，所以你想穿这个？”美里说道。气氛在那之后明显好转。女孩们分享着笑话和愚蠢的故事。明日香对于无法让绫波笑出声感到极度沮丧。她通过在绫波耳边低语某事，成功让绫波脸红。美里和律子都不确定她们是否真的想知道明日香说了什么。

Not two blocks away from the women, in the deli, sat Kaji and Shinji. Kaji had expected that Shinji would want to pick a fat food restraint. He was pleasantly surprised when Shinji selected a place that made fresh hot sandwiches. He normally ate a lot like Misato did before Shinji moved in with her. Instant ramen, micro waved curry dishes, and lots of fast food. Both Shinji and Kaji ordered turkey sandwiches with bacon and cheese on some sort of fancy bread that had basil in it.  
离女士们不到两个街区，在一家熟食店里，坐着加持和真嗣。加持本以为真嗣会选择一个油腻的快餐店。当真嗣挑选了一家制作新鲜热三明治的地方时，他感到惊喜。他通常像真嗣搬来之前的美里那样吃得很多。即食拉面、微波咖喱菜肴和大量的快餐。真嗣和加持都点了火鸡三明治，配以培根和奶酪，放在一种含有罗勒的特色面包上。

"So do you cook like this for Katsuragi?" Kaji asks.  
“那么，你像这样为葛城做饭吗？”加持问道。

"Not like this really, but I do try and make good meals." says Shinji.  
"并非完全如此，但我确实努力做出美味的饭菜。" 真嗣说道。

"Well, now I'm just jealous."  
"好吧，现在我只有羡慕的份了。"

"You could always come over for dinner some time. I don't mind cooking for people."  
"你随时可以过来吃晚饭。我不介意为别人下厨。"

"Mr. Ikari, is that an invitation?"  
"碇先生，这是邀请吗？"

"I guess." "我想是的。"

"Well then I'll be sure to remember that." Kaji and Shinji enjoyed there meal and he asked, "How's Asuka been?"  
"那我一定会记住的。" 加持和真嗣享受着他们的餐点，他问道："明日香最近怎么样？"

"Why don't you ask her?"  
"为什么不问问她呢？"

"Because I'm asking you." Kaji says. His smile turning to concern. "Is something wrong at home?"  
"因为我正在问你。" 薰说，他的笑容转为关切。"家里出什么事了吗？"

"Yeah." Shinji tells Kaji of the events at the arcade. The good and the bad.  
"是的。" 真嗣向薰讲述了在游戏厅发生的事情，好的和坏的。

"So why did you do it?" Kaji asks.  
"那你为什么要这么做？" 加持问道。

"When she wins she's happy. She got upset when I won."  
"她赢了就开心。我赢了她就难过。"

"She got upset, but not angry." Kaji doesn't ask. It was more of a statement. Shinji took notice. "Shinji, Asuka is a proud girl. She may not like to lose, but when you go easy on her and let her win you show her that you don't respect her."  
"她是难过了，但并没有生气。" 加持没有再问，更像是在陈述事实。真嗣注意到了这一点。"真嗣，明日香是个自尊心很强的女孩。她可能不喜欢输，但当你故意放水让她赢时，你其实是在表明你不尊重她。"

"But I do." says Shinji. "She's strong. I didn't mean to hurt her. I just wanted her to be happy."  
"但我确实这么想。" 真嗣说道，"她很坚强。我本无意伤害她。我只是希望她能幸福。"

"Did you tell her that?"  
"你告诉她了吗？"

"No. I was too afraid. I really don't think she likes me."  
"没有。我太害怕了。我真的觉得她不喜欢我。"

"Why would you say that? She is living with you." Kaji says, pointing out the obvious.  
"为什么这么说？她不是和你住在一起吗。" 薰指出这个显而易见的事实。

"She only moved in to destroy the seventh Angel."  
"她搬进来只是为了摧毁第七使徒。"

"But Shinji. She's still there. If she wasn't enjoying herself she could of easily moved somewhere else." Shinji just sat there. The thought that she could of left at any time had never really occurred to him before.  
"但是，真嗣，她还在那里。如果她不开心，她完全可以轻易搬到别的地方去。" 真嗣只是坐在那里。她随时可以离开的想法，他以前从未真正考虑过。

"It's all about respect, Shinji." says Kaji.  
"尊重是关键，真嗣。" 加贺说。

Shinji smiles to himself. "Misato told me that. She was telling me that if I did whatever a woman told me to do she wouldn't respect me."  
真嗣暗自微笑。"美里这么告诉我的。她说如果我总是听从女人的吩咐，她就不会尊重我。"

"She's a smart woman." says Kaji. "This is what I want you to do next time Asuka tells you to do something. Just say 'No'. Don't be rude. Just tell her you don't want to. Then a few minutes later. I want YOU to suggest something you can both do together. Something you know she'll enjoy."  
"她是个聪明的女人。" 加贺说，"下次明日香让你做什么时，我希望你这么做：直接说'不'。不要无礼，只是告诉她你不想做。然后过几分钟，我希望你提出一个你们可以一起做的活动，一个你知道她会喜欢的。"

Shinji wasn't so sure, but he agreed to at least give it a try once. Nervously, Shinji asks Kaji a question. "How do you tell if a person likes you?"  
真嗣不太确定，但他同意至少尝试一次。紧张地，真嗣向加持提出了一个问题。“你怎么知道一个人是否喜欢你？”

Kaji laughs and says, "That's easy. All you need to do is smile at them." Shinji gave Kaji a skeptical gaze. "When you smile they know you care. If they smile back at you that means they care about you too."  
加持笑着说：“那很简单。你只需要对他们微笑。”真嗣给了加持一个怀疑的眼神。“当你微笑时，他们知道你在乎。如果他们也对你微笑，那就意味着他们也在乎你。”

"That seems awfully simple."  
“这似乎太简单了。”

"Often times the answer to a complex question is a simple one." Kaji says in a matter of fact tone. "I do have one tip for when you find a woman you love."  
"很多时候，复杂问题的答案其实很简单。" 加持以一种就事论事的口吻说道，"当你找到心爱的女人时，我有一个小建议。

Shinji is completely caught off guard by this topic, but he finds himself ready to listen to every word. "Mind you this probably wont apply in the summer, but it's still a good tip." says Kaji, and Shinji wondered why he was telling him. "On a cold day. When your girl goes into the shower. Take her bathrobe and put it in the dryer. When you hear the water stop. Take the robe out and greet her with a warm fluffy robe. I guaranty you she will melt."  
真嗣对这个话题完全措手不及，但他发现自己准备好聆听每一个字。"注意，这招可能在夏天不适用，但仍是个好建议。" 加持说，真嗣纳闷他为什么要告诉自己。"在寒冷的日子里，当你的女孩去洗澡时，把她的浴袍放进烘干机。当你听到水声停止，取出浴袍，用一件温暖蓬松的浴袍迎接她。我保证她会感动得心都化了。

Shinji asks, "Did you do that for Misato?"  
真嗣问道："你为美里做过那样的事吗？"

Kaji sat silently with a smile that told Shinji he was lost in a memory. Kaji took a deep breath and said, "Well, since we are both done I best get you home. Don't want Katsuragi to think I'm trying to steal you away.".Shinji actually enjoyed the drive home. Kaji was a much more skilled driver then Misato. No zooming through lights or near misses. When Kaji stopped Shinji didn't feel the need to kiss the ground.  
薰静静地坐着，脸上挂着微笑，让真嗣知道他正沉浸在回忆中。薰深吸一口气，说道：“好吧，既然我们都忙完了，我最好送你回家。可不想让葛城以为我要把你拐走。”真嗣其实很享受回家的车程。薰的驾驶技术比美里好得多，没有闯红灯，也没有险些擦撞。当薰停车时，真嗣并没有感到需要亲吻地面。

Kaji got Shinji home well in time before Misato and Asuka got home. Shinji asked Kaji if he wanted to wait for Misato inside, but Kaji declined the offer. "Places to go, Mr. Ikari. No need to tell her I was even here." was all Kaji said as he left. Shinji put up Pen-pen's empty dish and found him right back on the bean bag chair in front of the TV. Shinji grabbed the seat he had earlier and enjoy the show that had the penguins attention.  
薰在美里和明日香回家之前，就把真嗣安全送到了家。真嗣问薰是否想进屋等美里，但薰婉拒了。“还有地方要去，碇君。没必要告诉她我来过。”薰说完就离开了。真嗣收拾好企鹅的空盘子，发现它又回到了电视前的豆袋椅上。真嗣抓起之前坐过的椅子，享受着吸引企鹅注意的节目。

Misato and Asuka walked in smiling and laughing. They greeted Shinji and took their new purchases to their rooms. Asuka walked out wearing her new hair bows. Misato apologized for getting home so late, and asked if he was bored all alone. He just said he was fine.  
美里和明日香笑着走进来，她们向真嗣打招呼，并把新买的东西拿进各自的房间。明日香走出来时戴着她的新发饰。美里为这么晚回家道歉，并询问他一个人是否感到无聊。他只是回答说还好。

Misato and Asuka seemed to have some sort of silent agreement going. One of the rules that was set on their girls day out was that nothing said was to be talked about with any boy. Asuka was a lot kinder to Shinji since she got back. She got herself a glass of orange juice and sat next to him and watched TV.  
明日香和美里似乎达成了某种默契。她们女生外出时定下的规矩之一就是，所说的话不得与任何男生讨论。自从回来后，明日香对真嗣的态度温和了许多。她给自己倒了一杯橙汁，坐在他旁边一起看电视。

About an hour later Asuka looked to Shinji and says, "Shinji, make some of those little tacos. Those were good.",  
大约一小时后，明日香转向真嗣说：“真嗣，做点那种小玉米饼吧，挺好吃的。”

Shinji was about to sit up and get to work when Kaji's advice came back to him. _"Just give it a try, and pray I don't get hurt."_ he thinks. He takes a breath and with little emotion says, "No."  
真嗣正要起身开始动手，这时他想起了加持的建议。“就试试看，祈祷我不会受伤。”他心想。他深吸一口气，面无表情地说：“不。”

Asuka was shocked. "Why?" she asks.  
明日香震惊了。“为什么？”她问道。

"Cause I don't want to right now." He was very polite in his tone as he flipped channels. Asuka was stuck to find her words and trying to identify the boy before her. She wanted to complain, but it wasn't like he was rude about it.  
“因为现在我不想。”他语气礼貌地切换着频道。明日香一时语塞，试图辨认眼前的这个男孩。她想抱怨，但他并没有无礼。

Shinji keeps glancing to the clock. He thinks, _"When Kaji said wait a few minutes how many did he mean?"_. Shinji racked his brain to think of something they could do together. Fifteen minutes pass and Shinji asks her, "Hey Asuka. Want to help me make an apple crisp?"  
真嗣不时瞥向时钟。他心想：“当加持先生说等几分钟，他指的是多少分钟？”真嗣绞尽脑汁想找点他们能一起做的事情。十五分钟过去了，真嗣问她：“嘿，明日香，想帮我一起做苹果酥吗？”

Asuka just smiles. "Sure."  
明日香只是微笑着。"当然。"

The two worked well together as Shinji walked her through the steps to make a delicious apple crisp. Shinji peeled and Asuka chopped. He had tips like using a variety of different apples, adding more cinnamon and nutmeg, and making twice the crisp the original recipe called for. They put it in the oven and a few minutes later Misato came out of her room.  
两人合作得很好，真嗣一步步教她如何制作美味的苹果酥。真嗣负责削皮，明日香负责切块。他给出了一些建议，比如使用不同种类的苹果，增加肉桂和肉豆蔻的用量，以及将酥皮的分量加倍。他们将其放入烤箱，几分钟后，美里从房间里走了出来。

"Oh what is that heavenly smell." moans Misato.  
"哦，这是什么天堂般的香味。"美里赞叹道。

Asuka nearly leaped at the chance to tell Misato they had made an apple crisp. She even volunteered to run to the corner store to get some vanilla ice cream when Misato pointed out they were out. All three of them enjoyed their dessert before dinner that night.  
明日香几乎迫不及待地抓住机会告诉美里，他们做了一份苹果酥。当美里指出他们没有香草冰淇淋时，她甚至主动提出跑到街角商店去买一些。那天晚上，三人在晚餐前享受了甜点。

Shinji had to test something. He looked up across the table to Asuka. He waited till she caught his gaze and he smiled. She gave him a confused look, then he looked away. If only he had just kept this connection for a second longer he would of seen Asuka smile back.  
真嗣需要测试一件事。他抬头望向桌子对面的明日香。他等到她捕捉到他的目光，然后微笑了。她给了他一个困惑的表情，随后他移开了视线。如果他只是再多保持这一联系一秒钟，他就会看到明日香回以微笑。

A/N: My longest chapter to date. It really needed to be though. When this chapter is over you will understand. There will be some typos in this chapter. I will be scanning the page quite a few times for the accidental ones, but some are there by design. You'll see. So please lay off on the typo comments in reviews.  
作者的话：这是我迄今为止最长的章节。但它确实需要这么长。当你读完这一章，你就会明白。这一章中会有一些打字错误。我会多次检查页面，以找出那些意外的错误，但有些错误是故意为之。你会明白的。所以请不要在评论中过多地指出打字错误。

Didn't you just want to slap Shinji upside the head at the end of that last. That's what I wanted you to feel at least. In that moment I think you really start to connect with Asuka as well. I wasn't sure about adding Rei into the whole Girls Day scene. Once I started writing it though I saw she was perfect to bring in some laughs. I really wonder if many people understood Misato's reaction to Asuka's comment about the underwear. I think it was also a bit obvious as to why Kaji just showed up to take Shinji out.  
在上一章的结尾，你难道不想给真嗣一巴掌吗？至少我希望你能有这种感觉。在那一刻，我想你也真正开始与明日香产生共鸣了。我原本不确定是否应该把绫波也加入到整个女孩节的场景中。但一旦我开始写，我就发现她非常适合带来一些笑料。我很想知道有多少人理解了美里对明日香关于内衣的评论的反应。我想，为什么加持会突然出现带真嗣出去，这一点也很明显。

I took a big leap this time with commenting that Ritsuko might of met Yui and maybe Shinji. I don't think that's too far beyond belief. Ritsuko was around helping her mother. I wasn't saying they were close at all.  
这次我大胆猜测，可能律子遇见了唯和真嗣。我认为这并非完全不可信。律子当时在帮助她的母亲。我并不是说他们关系密切。

Mana makes her return. I so so so so so look forward to the reviews and comments after you are done reading this chapter.  
万叶回归了。我非常非常非常期待你们读完这一章后的评论和留言。

**Chapter 6: Lies Behind a Truth  
第六章：真相背后的谎言**

The day had just begun for Shinji. He had his day pretty much planned out. It was one of the first times Shinji had something planned to do after school that didn't involve the Evas. Today was his- interview. Mana was expecting him a few hours after school. What could they even talk about? Why did he even agree to this? His head was hidden under his pillow. "_I can't think with all that noise."_ he thinks. Out in the kitchen Misato and Asuka were having some kind of argument.  
新的一天刚刚开始，对真嗣来说，他的日程已经安排得满满当当。这是真嗣难得一次放学后不涉及 EVA 的计划。今天是他——面试的日子。真名预计他放学后几小时会到。他们能聊些什么呢？他为什么要答应这个？他的头埋在枕头下。“这么吵，我怎么想事情。”他想。在厨房里，美里和明日香正在争吵。

"Rock!" “石头！”

"Paper!" “布！”

"Scissors!" "剪刀！"

"Go!"

"Ha ha!" "哈哈！"

"Rock!" "石头！"

"Paper!" “纸！”

"Scissors!" “剪刀！”

"Go!"

"Yeah!" “耶！”

"Hey! You cheated." 嘿！你作弊了。

"I did NOT!" 我没有！

Shinji sits up on his bed. Hanging his head in frustration. He scratches his belly and stares at the floor.  
真嗣坐在床上，沮丧地垂着头。他挠了挠肚子，盯着地板发呆。

"Come on best five out of seven."  
"来吧，五局三胜。"

"I should get it. It's my day off and I'm taking it to Ritsuko. I promised her last night."  
"我应该去拿。今天我休息，我要把它带给律子。我昨晚答应她了。"

"Liar! You had four servings last night. You're going to get a gut."  
"骗子！你昨晚吃了四份。你快要有啤酒肚了。"

"Ohhhh, that's low…" 哦，这招真狠……

"I made it anyways." 反正我做到了。

"You helped." 你也帮忙了。

"At least I worked on it."  
"至少我努力过了。"

Shinji stood up at his door. He tried to summon the courage to open his door. It's too bad the only escape route was past the arguing women. He took a deep breath and took the plunge. He opened his door and was suddenly met with the intense gaze of Misato and Asuka. They were standing at opposite ends of the table on their feet. Pen-pen is by the table with a look like he may jump up. At the center of the table was the object of their debate. A serving of the apple crisp left over from last night.  
真嗣站在他的门前，试图鼓起勇气打开门。遗憾的是，唯一的逃生路线要经过正在争吵的女人们。他深吸一口气，决定冒险一试。他打开门，突然迎上了美里和明日香强烈的目光。她们站在桌子两端，都站了起来。企鹅 Pen-pen 在桌子旁，一副随时可能跳起来的样子。桌子中央是他们争论的焦点——昨晚剩下的苹果脆片。

"Good, you're up." says Asuka looking to him. She smiles as if she was just dealt the last card in a royal flush.  
"太好了，你起来了。"明日香看着他说道，她微笑着，仿佛刚刚拿到了一手皇家同花顺。

"Oh, Shinjiiiii." Misato says seductively. She not so subtly starts to bend forward.  
"哦，真嗣～～～" 美里用一种诱惑的语气说道，她不那么含蓄地开始向前弯腰。

Asuka turns on Misato and yells, "Don't you try and sweet talk him, and quit trying to flash your cleavage! You pervert!"  
明日香转向美里，大声喊道："别想用甜言蜜语哄他，也别再试图炫耀你的乳沟了！你这个变态！"

"_You're just upset, cause you don't have any to show off."_ Misato thinks with a sly grin.  
"你只是因为自己没有可以炫耀的，所以才生气吧。" 美里心里想着，脸上露出一丝狡黠的笑容。

Asuka returns her blue eyes to Shinji. "Shinji, we made this dessert. Who should get the last bit?" she says. She smiles and bats her eyes. "Me," Her eyes narrow and in a nasty tone she continues, " or Misato?". Both start to try to make themselves look as tempting as they can. Asuka's attempt to look innocent might work if he didn't know her. Misato has gone back to her previous plot to show off her mature curves.  
明日香将她的蓝眼睛转向真嗣。“真嗣，我们做的这个甜点，最后一块该给谁呢？”她说着，微笑着眨了眨眼。“是我，”她的眼神一紧，语气变得尖刻，“还是美里？”两人开始尽力让自己看起来更加诱人。如果真嗣不了解她，明日香装作无辜的样子或许能奏效。而美里则回到了她之前的策略，展示她成熟的曲线。

Shinji looks from one to the other. His brain is on fire. It's several long seconds until he comes up with the best plan for this situation. He quickly shuts this door with himself behind it.  
真嗣在两人之间来回看着，他的大脑一片混乱。过了好一会儿，他才想出了应对这种情况的最佳方案。他迅速关上了门，把自己关在了里面。

"Feigling!" Asuka yells. “懦夫！”明日香喊道。

The girls argued for another fifteen minutes until they came to the obvious idea of splitting the apple treat. Once they had settled that Shinji felt free to exit the room and get into the bathroom to prepare for school. Shinji didn't see the spiteful look Asuka gave him for not picking her over Misato.  
女孩们又争论了十五分钟，直到她们想出了一个显而易见的办法——平分苹果点心。一旦解决了这个问题，真嗣就感觉可以自由地离开房间，去浴室准备上学了。真嗣并没有看到明日香因为他没有选择她而不是美里而投来的怨恨眼神。

By the time he came out the two had done a quick change and were gossiping and laughing. Ever since that lunch they shared the two seemed to have become closer. They were even talking about going out shopping again.  
当他出来时，那两人已经迅速换了衣服，正在闲聊和笑闹。自从那次午餐后，她们似乎变得更亲近了。她们甚至还在讨论再次出去购物的事。

"Shinji get out here now, or I'm leaving!" Asuka yelled waiting at the door. They wouldn't of been running so late if he didn't have to hide in his room earlier. He didn't even have time for much of a breakfast. He rushed out of his room and made a toaster pastry. Asuka was half way to the elevator while Shinji was bouncing around trying to get his shoes on. He passed Misato on his way out. He caught her eyes and smiled. His mood was lifted when he noticed her smile back and wish him a good day.  
“真嗣，现在就出来，不然我就走了！”明日香在门口喊道。如果不是他早些时候不得不躲在房间里，他们也不会这么晚。他甚至没有时间好好吃早餐。他冲出房间，匆忙地做了个烤面包点心。明日香已经走到电梯的一半，而真嗣还在蹦跳着试图穿上鞋子。他在出门的路上遇到了美里。他捕捉到她的目光，微笑了。当他注意到她也回以微笑并祝他有个美好的一天时，他的心情变得愉快起来。

Shinji rushes to catch the elevator before it closes. He's huffing for his breath from the mad sprint. Asuka just chuckles and says under her breath, "Pathetic.".  
真嗣冲向电梯，试图在门关闭前赶上。他因疯狂的冲刺而气喘吁吁。明日香只是轻笑一声，低声说道：“真可怜。”

At lunch Hikari made a passionate plea to let her eat alone with Touji. Seems the pseudo date that Hikari had set up with had gone just as she hoped. Asuka wasn't pleased to have to give up her favorite lunch partner. Sitting for a few minutes she looked for someone to join her. She didn't want to sit in silence to eat. That singled out Rei quickly. She grabbed Shinji by the wrist and told him that he was eating with her today.  
午餐时，光强烈请求允许她和东治单独用餐。看来光安排的这次模拟约会正如她所愿。明日香不高兴地放弃了她最喜欢的午餐伙伴。坐了几分钟后，她寻找着能加入她的人。她不想在沉默中用餐。这很快排除了零。她抓住真嗣的手腕，告诉他今天他要和她一起吃饭。

On the roof Hikari and Touji were absent. Asuka and Shinji sat alone. When Kensuke tried to join them Asuka shooed him away. Dejected Kensuke sat with Rei. Ten minutes passed when Asuka started to drum her nails.  
屋顶上，光和东治不在。明日香和真嗣独自坐着。当健介试图加入他们时，明日香把他赶走了。失落的健介和零坐在一起。十分钟过去了，明日香开始敲打她的指甲。

"Well don't just sit there like a log. Say something." Asuka snaps.  
"哎呀，别像个木头似的坐在那儿。说点什么。" 明日香厉声说道。

"Uh." Shinji mumbles. "Did you have fun yesterday with Misato?"  
"呃。" 真嗣嘟囔着。"你昨天和美里玩得开心吗？"

Asuka seems pleased with the topic. She says, "Yeah it was nice. Can't tell you the details though. It's above your clearance level." Asuka giggles, and Shinji is just confused.  
明日香对这个话题似乎很满意。她说："嗯，挺好的。不过细节不能告诉你。这超出了你的权限级别。" 明日香咯咯笑起来，而真嗣则是一头雾水。

"Why aren't Hikari and Touji here?"  
"为什么光和冬二不在这里？"

"They're having lunch together. They might start dating now." she says with obvious disgust.  
"他们一起吃午饭去了。现在可能要开始交往了。" 她带着明显的厌恶说道。

"What!" Shinji's yell catches both Kensuke's and Rei's attention.  
"什么！" 真嗣的喊声吸引了剑介和绫波的注意。

"Keep quiet, Idiot." Asuka says backhanding his arm.  
"安静点，笨蛋。" 明日香说着，反手拍了拍他的胳膊。

"When did this happen?" "这是什么时候的事？"

"This weekend I think." she says to the surprised Shinji. "Didn't you notice today that he was calling Hikari by her name rather then 'Class Rep'."  
"我想是这个周末吧。" 她对惊讶的碇真嗣说，"你今天没注意到吗？他开始直接叫光的名字，而不是'班长'了。"

"No."

"Boys." she says rolling her eyes.  
"男孩们。" 她翻了个白眼说道。

"When we were alone he called her 'Hikari'. Just to her face he uses 'Class Rep'. " he says. "When did it start?"  
当我们独处时，他称她为'光'。但在她面前，他只用'班长'来称呼。" 他说，"这是什么时候开始的？

"At the arcade." 在游戏厅。

"But if that was their date why were we there?"  
"但如果那是他们的约会，为什么我们也在那里？"

"I don't know. Change the subject." Asuka snaps. The topic and events of Saturday seemed to hit a nerve.  
"我不知道。换个话题。" 明日香突然说道。周六的话题和事件似乎触动了她的某根神经。

As they walked through the school Asuka seemed to scan the halls as if watching out for someone. They met up with a very comfortable Hikari and Touji. Kensuke asked where he was, but he was pretty tight lipped. Shinji wasn't listening when someone called his name. "Hey, Ikari."  
当他们穿过学校时，明日香似乎在扫视走廊，好像在提防着某人。他们与非常自在的班长和冬二会合了。剑介询问他的去向，但他口风很紧。真嗣并没有在听，这时有人叫了他的名字。"嘿，碇。"

Mana appeared coming out of the ladies restroom. "H-hi Mana. About today I'm not-" Shinji says.  
Mana 从女洗手间走出来。“M-Mana，关于今天，我并不是——”Shinji 说道。

"Oh yeah. I can't wait to just pick your brain." She makes a little pinching motion to his head., causing Shinji to flinch. "You have no idea how much this means to me."  
“哦，对。我迫不及待想挖掘你的想法。”她对着他的头做了一个小小的捏取动作，让 Shinji 不禁一缩。“你不知道这对我来说意味着什么。”

"Uh," Shinji was trying to back out, but the hope in Mana's eyes crushes his resolve. "Okay. What time?"  
"“呃，”Shinji 正试图退出，但 Mana 眼中的希望粉碎了他的决心。“好吧。几点？”

"How about five? That gives you enough time to get home and meet up right?"  
"五点怎么样？这样你有足够的时间回家，然后准时碰头。"

"Yeah that's-" "嗯，就这——"

"Get moving, Stupid!" Asuka says, pushing Shinji in the back forcing him further down the hall. "I don't want to be late."  
"快点，笨蛋！" 明日香说着，推了推真嗣的后背，催促他继续沿着走廊前进。"我不想迟到。"

"Bye, Ikari." Mana calls after Shinji in a sweet tone. "See you later for our date."  
"再见，碇。" 真奈用甜美的声音向真嗣喊道，"约会时再见哦。"

This claim causes Asuka to pause and spin to look at the girl behind them. Mana however has no idea as she is now walking casually back to her class. Anything Asuka wants to say would just get lost in the background noise of the crowd rushing through the halls. Girls pass Shinji giggling. He thinks, _"It's a date?"_. Passing girls giggle even more as they see him blushing.  
这话让明日香停下脚步，转身看向身后的女孩。然而，真奈对此一无所知，正悠闲地走回自己的教室。明日香想说的话只会淹没在人群涌过走廊的嘈杂声中。经过真嗣的女孩们咯咯地笑。他心想，"这是约会？"。看到他脸红，经过的女孩们笑得更欢了。

Kensuke and Touji teased Shinji unmercifully. Hikari seemed to need to spend most of the day trying to bring Asuka from a boil to a steady simmer. It was hard for Hikari, because Asuka refused to even admit there was anything wrong.  
剑介和东治无情地取笑真嗣。而光似乎一整天都在努力让明日香从怒火中烧的状态平息下来。这对光来说很困难，因为明日香甚至拒绝承认有什么不对劲。

Ten minutes till the dismissal bell Asuka saw an instant message on her laptop.  
距离放学铃响还有十分钟，明日香在她的笔记本电脑上看到了一条即时消息。

**ClassRep2-A:** Asuka, is Shinji really dating Mana?

The final class bell rang three minutes later. Hikari as the class representative called for the class to stand and bow before being dismissed. Asuka bolted from the class like a bat out of hell. Not caring that such an abrupt action just caused more people to take notice. Hikari just turned and gave a very good impersonation of Asuka's favorite evil glare directed at Touji. The tough jock seemed to shrink several inches.  
三分钟后，最后一节课的铃声响起。作为班代表的光呼唤全班起立鞠躬后解散。明日香像离弦之箭般冲出教室，毫不在意这样突然的举动反而引起了更多人的注意。光转过身，完美模仿了明日香最爱的那种恶狠狠的瞪视，直指东治。这位硬汉似乎因此矮了几分。

"Asuka had cleanup duty." Hikari says to herself, looking after her friend. She wanted to run after her, but she is also on duty.  
"明日香负责打扫卫生。" 光自言自语，望着朋友的背影。她本想追上去，但自己也有任务在身。

"I'll help." says Touji timidly.  
"我来帮忙。" 冬二怯生生地说。

Hikari just turned on him. "I don't want to talk with you right now, Touji. Just go home. I'll call you later." Touji just went stiff as Hikari scolded him, and once she was done he ran out faster then Asuka had earlier. Hikari was groaning in frustration when the sound of desks being moved caught her attention. She looked to the source and saw Shinji shifting the desks around.  
光立刻转向他，"我现在不想和你说话，冬二。你先回家吧，我晚点再联系你。" 冬二在光的责备下僵硬了身体，等她一说完，他便比明日香更迅速地跑了出去。光正懊恼地叹气，这时移动桌子的声音吸引了她的注意。她朝声源望去，看到真嗣正在挪动桌椅。

"Shinji what are you doing. It's Asuka's duty today." she says.  
"真嗣，你在做什么？今天是明日香的责任。" 她说道。

"I know." Shinji says. "I'll help. I don't want her to get into any trouble, and it's not right for you to do it alone."  
"我知道。" 真嗣说，"我来帮忙。我不想让她陷入麻烦，而且你一个人做也不公平。"

Hikari stands there and smiles. She starts to help moving the desks. "I wouldn't turn her in. She's my friend, and you're a good friend too." she says.  
光站在那里微笑着，开始帮忙搬动桌子。"我不会告发她的。她是我的朋友，你也是一个好朋友。" 她说道。

"I guess." he says. "我猜是吧。" 他说道。

Shinji just gives a weak smile and helps Hikari clean the class. Before they part ways to head home Shinji pleaded for mercy for Touji. Hikari just smiles. She tells Shinji to hurry or he will be late for his interview. Shinji hardly seems that interested, but walks home at a much faster pace.  
真嗣只是无力地笑了笑，然后帮光打扫教室。在各自回家前，真嗣为东治求情。光只是微笑着。她告诉真嗣快点，否则他会错过面试。真嗣看起来并不太感兴趣，但还是加快了回家的步伐。

Shinji was running late as he got home. Misato was sitting out on the patio with a magazine. Asuka was nowhere to be seen. Pen-pen was walking through the kitchen to bring his master a Yebisu beer. "I'm home, Misato." Shinji calls out, as he bolts into his room. Shinji throws on some comfortable shorts and shirt. Misato is standing at his door when he exits. She starts to open his mouth, but is cut off. "Please don't make any date jokes. I got enough of those at school." he says. Misato looks a little put out at her joke being ruined.  
真嗣回到家时已经迟了。美里正坐在露台上翻阅杂志，明日香则不见踪影。企鹅正穿过厨房，给主人拿来一瓶惠比寿啤酒。"我回来了，美里。" 真嗣喊着，冲进自己的房间。他迅速换上舒适的短裤和 T 恤。当他出来时，美里正站在门口。她刚要开口，却被打断了。"请不要开约会玩笑，我在学校已经听够了。" 他说。美里看起来因为笑话被破坏而有些失落。

Misato starts to follow Shinji. She gentle rubs his back. "Shin-chan you alright?" she says in concern.  
碇真嗣开始跟随真嗣。她温柔地抚摸着他的背。“真嗣，你还好吗？”她关切地问道。

"Sorry Misato. I'm just running late."  
“对不起，美里。我只是迟到了。”

"Oh, just stay cool and be yourself. You're a cutie I'm sure she'll take it easy on you."  
“哦，保持冷静，做你自己就好。你这么可爱，我相信她会对你手下留情的。”

"Uh, thanks." Shinji says, blushing. "Well, I'm out of here."  
"呃，谢谢。" 真嗣说道，脸颊泛红。"好了，我走了。"

"Not without me, Third Child." Asuka's door slides open as Misato and Shinji pass. Both glance to her and stop dead in their tracks. Their eyes move in unison as they scan her up and down. She's wearing a comfortable short sleeves black shirt, choker, thigh high leggings, and a very tiny skirt.  
"没我可不行，第三适格者。" 当美里和真嗣经过时，明日香的门滑开了。两人同时向她看去，停下了脚步。他们的目光一致地上下打量着她。她穿着一件舒适的黑色短袖衬衫，戴着项圈，穿着到大腿的紧身袜，还有一条非常短的裙子。

"You're not going out like that!" Misato yells much louder then intended. She points to the small, frilly skirt. Misato catches a scent in the air. "Is that my lavender purfume?" Shinji just stands silent, blushing.  
"你不能就这样出门！" 美里大声喊道，声音比预想的要大。她指着那条小巧的蕾丝裙。美里闻到了空气中的香味。"那是我的薰衣草香水吗？" 真嗣只是静静地站着，脸红着。

"What's wrong?" Asuka scowls. "It's warm out. Anyways I'll be with Shinji." She strides up to him and grabs him by the sleeve. If anyone tries anything perverted I'm sure he'll defend me." She stares him in the eye. "You will won't you?"  
"怎么了？" 明日香皱眉道，"外面很暖和。再说，我会和真嗣在一起。" 她大步走向他，抓住他的袖子。如果有人想做些下流的事，我相信他会保护我的。" 她直视他的眼睛，"你会的，对吧？"

"Uh, um." he sputters still unable to form words. "_Her eyes are paralyzing."_ he thinks.  
"呃，嗯。" 他结巴着，还是说不出话来。"她的眼睛让人动弹不得。" 他心想。

"I thought this was Shinji's date?" Misato says.  
"我以为这是真嗣的约会呢？" 美里说。

Asuka's brow flinches. "I'm going to keep him from saying anything classified. Now get moving."  
明日香的眉头微微一皱。“我要阻止他说出任何机密。现在快走。”

"Oh wait." Misato calls after them before they can leave. "It's my turn to pick up dinner and I really shouldn't drive." Asuka gives Misato a look. "What? It's my day off." Misato places a couple of yen in Shinji's hand. "Pick up some take out for dinner tonight."  
“哦，等等。”在他们离开前，美里叫住了他们。“今天轮到我买晚饭，而且我真的不该开车。”明日香对美里投去一个眼神。“怎么了？今天我休息。”美里在真嗣手里放了几张日元。“今晚买点外卖回来。”

"Okay." Asuka says. "Now get moving, Idiot."  
“好的。”明日香说。“现在快走，笨蛋。”

Misato watches from the doorway as Asuka drags Shinji to the elevator. She looks back inside. "Pen-pen stop drinking my beer, damn it!" The door closes. Screaming and squawking can be heard. "Drink your own!"  
美里站在门口，看着明日香拉着真嗣走向电梯。她回头朝屋内喊道：“企鹅，别再喝我的啤酒了，真是的！”门关上了，里面传来尖叫和嘎嘎声。“喝你自己的去！”

Many eyes followed the pair as Shinji walked with Asuka. No one was looking at Shinji. The sun was starting to set. There was a warm glow to the sky that was in contrast to the cool breeze in the air.  
许多人注视着真嗣和明日香一同行走。没有人看向真嗣。太阳开始西沉，天空中泛起温暖的余晖，与空气中的凉风形成对比。

They made it to the ice cream shop. Mana was sitting at the table outside, a cup of strawberry ice cream next to her. She saw Shinji and started waving. She also made no attempt to hide her disappointment when she noticed Asuka by his side. Disappointment changed to disgust as she looked at what Asuka was wearing. Mana really didn't have much room to talk. She was also wearing a skirt much too short for her age.  
他们到达了冰淇淋店。真名坐在外面的桌子旁，旁边放着一杯草莓冰淇淋。她看到真嗣便开始挥手，同时也毫不掩饰地流露出失望之情，当她注意到真嗣身边的明日香时。失望转为厌恶，当她看到明日香的穿着时。真名自己也没什么资格说别人，她穿的裙子也远超她年龄应有的长度。

"Hi Mana? "Shinji says, walking up to her table. "Sorry I'm running a little late."  
"嗨，玛娜？" 真嗣边说边走向她的桌子，"抱歉，我稍微迟到了一点。

"It's cool. Well, do-" Mana says.  
""没事。那么，我们-" 玛娜正说着。

"Yeah yeah." Asuka says cutting her off. "This is fascinating. Shinji go get the ice cream. This place has great watermelon sorbet." Asuka gives Shinji a little push and takes a seat across from Mana .  
""对对。" 明日香打断了她，"这太有趣了。真嗣，去拿冰淇淋吧。这家店的西瓜雪葩很棒。" 明日香轻轻推了真嗣一下，然后坐在玛娜对面。

"Why don't you get it?" he says.  
"你怎么就不明白呢？" 他说道。

"Because it's cold in the shop." she says to him and looks to Mana. "Let's get this over with."  
"因为店里太冷了。" 她对他说，然后看向 Mana。"我们快点解决吧。"

Shinji shoulders drop in surrender. "You want a cup or a cone?"  
真嗣的肩膀垂了下来，表示投降。"你要杯子装还是蛋卷装？"

"Sugar cone, please." she says waving.  
"请给我一个甜筒。" 她挥手说道。

Once Shinji is through the door Mana looks to Asuka. They both eye each other over. "So what brings you here, Asuka?" says Mana.  
当真嗣穿过门后，麻奈看向明日香。两人互相打量了一番。"那么，你来这里做什么，明日香？" 麻奈问道。

"I'm just here to keep that idiot from talking about anything secret."  
"我只是来防止那个笨蛋泄露任何秘密。"

"Why do you call him that?"  
"你为什么这么叫他？"

"Cause he is." "因为他就是那样。"

"He's got a cute butt." Mana says watching Shinji waiting in line. Asuka blushes.  
"他的屁股挺可爱的。" 玛娜边说边看着真嗣排队。明日香脸红了。

You could cut the tension with a knife as Shinji returns with a cup and a cone. Shinji takes a seat and Mana opens up her laptop. "Okay lets get started." she says. She started by asking both of them some simple questions. Mostly just name, age, and a bit of background.  
气氛紧张得仿佛可以用刀子切开，这时真嗣带着一杯饮料和一个甜筒回来了。他坐下后，玛娜打开了她的笔记本电脑。“好了，我们开始吧。”她说道。她首先向两人提出了一些简单的问题，主要是姓名、年龄和一些背景信息。

"So Shinji, what was it like the first time you piloted?" Mana asks.  
“那么，真嗣，你第一次驾驶是什么感觉？”玛娜问道。

"It was scary." The fear of Shinji's first battle in the Evangelions came back. He had blacked out and never really knew what had happened. "I'm really not sure what happened really. I'd never even heard of this stuff when I first arrived."  
“很可怕。”真嗣第一次驾驶 EVA 战斗时的恐惧感再次涌上心头。他当时昏迷了，对发生的事情一无所知。“我真的不太清楚发生了什么。我刚到这里时，甚至都没听说过这些东西。”

"I was trained from a child to be a pilot." Asuka adds. Mana just gives Asuka a look and keeps typing. Mana would ask a question of Shinji. Asuka usually found a reason to answer herself or cut Shinji off. She would explain that it was "Classified". Her look softens when Shinji talks about loosing his mother when he was three years old. She considers reaching out and taking his hand, but stops herself.  
"我从小就被训练成为一名飞行员。" 明日香补充道。真名只是看了明日香一眼，继续打字。真名会向真嗣提问，而明日香通常会找到理由自己回答，或者打断真嗣。她会解释说这是"机密"。当真嗣谈及三岁时失去母亲时，她的表情变得柔和。她考虑伸手去握他的手，但最终还是阻止了自己。

"So you don't live with your father, and you lost your mother at a young age. What can you tell me about your guardian?"  
"这么说你并不和你的父亲住在一起，而且你很小就失去了母亲。你能告诉我关于你的监护人的情况吗？"

"She's a drunk and a slob." Asuka says.  
"她是个酒鬼，而且邋遢。" 明日香说道。

"Asuka!" Shinji scowls at her.  
"明日香！" 真嗣对她皱起了眉头。

"Yeah, I know." Asuka looks apologetic for her comment. "She's nice. She could clean up after herself more."  
"嗯，我知道。" 明日香对她的话显得有些歉意。"她人很好。她要是能多收拾收拾自己就好了。"

"Misato took me in when I first arrived. I was raised by my teacher, but Misato actually seemed to want me. She wouldn't take no for an answer." Shinji says to Mana. "Yeah, she can be a bit of a slob, but she's a really hard worker." Mana smiles.  
"我刚来的时候，是美里收留了我。我以前是由我的老师抚养的，但美里是真的想要我。她从不接受拒绝。" 真嗣对麻奈说。"是啊，她有时候是有点邋遢，但她工作真的很努力。" 麻奈微笑着说。

The interview goes on for another half hour. It is a polite conversation with the occasional comment from Asuka. She often makes sarcastic comments calling Mana, "Lois Lane". Much like her nickname for Rei being "Wonder girl". Mana even asks Asuka a few questions.  
采访又持续了半个小时。这是一场礼貌的对话，偶尔会有明日香插话。她经常用讽刺的评论称呼万为“露易丝·莱恩”，就像她给绫波起的绰号“奇迹女孩”一样。万甚至向明日香提了几个问题。

"Well thank you so much, Shinji." Mana says, closing her lap top. She stands up and shakes his hand holding it softly as she continues. She refuses to release. "It's going to take a few days for this to appear in the school paper. I need to run it through your people to make sure everything is alright. It should be in the Thursday edition. I'll see to it you get a copy the night before."  
“非常感谢你，真嗣。”万说着，合上她的笔记本电脑。她站起来，轻轻地握住他的手继续说道，却不愿松开。“这需要几天时间才能出现在校报上。我需要让你们的人过目，确保一切都没问题。应该会在周四的版面上。我会确保你在前一天晚上收到一份副本。”

"Okay, thanks." says Shinji.  
“好的，谢谢。”真嗣说道。

Mana even shakes Asuka's hand. Both look into each other eyes. There arms shake as they squeeze. A challenge to see who will let go first. Both come to a stalemate and give each other rather fake smiles.  
Mana 甚至与 Asuka 握手。两人目光交汇。他们的手臂在紧握中颤抖，仿佛在挑战谁会先放手。双方陷入僵局，彼此交换了颇为虚假的微笑。

Asuka slips her arms around Shinji's and they walk off. "Good bye Mr. Ikari. See you in school tomorrow." Mana says as they leave. She takes a seat and crosses her fingers watching after Shinji and his companion.  
Asuka 挽着 Shinji 的手臂离开。“再见，碇先生。明天学校见。”Mana 在他们离开时说道。她坐下来，交叉手指，目送着 Shinji 和他的同伴。

The streets aren't crowed. This time of night many couples are out on their way to dates. There is a calm in the air and a cool breeze. "That wasn't so bad." Shinji says, further down the road. He eats his sweet treat that he wasn't able to enjoy much during the interview.  
街道并不拥挤。这个时间，许多情侣正前往约会的路上。空气中弥漫着宁静，微风轻拂。“那也没那么糟。”Shinji 在更远的路边说道，他吃着在采访中未能尽情享受的甜点。

"If you say so." Asuka says. Shinji offers her the spoon.  
"如果你这么说的话。" 明日香说道。真嗣递给她勺子。

"You want some?" he says.  
"你想来点吗？" 他说。

Asuka looks surprised. She smiles and gently takes the offered spoon. "Yeah thanks." she says. They share what is left of the sorbet as they walk through the street and try to pick from the variety of fast food restaurants. They see the golden arches, Mos Burger, Dom Dom, Wendy's, and one catches Asuka's eye.  
明日香显得有些惊讶。她微笑着，轻轻接过递来的勺子。"嗯，谢谢。" 她说。他们一边分享着剩下的冰糕，一边沿着街道走，试图从众多快餐店中挑选一家。他们看到了金拱门、摩斯汉堡、多姆多姆、温迪斯，还有一家吸引了明日香的目光。

"Oh I love this stuff. Come on, Shinji!" she says.  
"哦，我太喜欢这个了。快来，真嗣！" 她说道。

Shinji looks at the red and white sign. "What's 'KFC'?" he asks.  
真嗣看着那个红白相间的招牌。"肯德基是什么？" 他问道。

"Kentucky...Fried...Chicken, moron."  
"肯塔基...炸...鸡，笨蛋。"

"Why doesn't the sign say that then?"  
"为什么标牌上不直接这么写呢？"

"Because it's obvious." she says, walking inside.  
"因为这很明显。" 她说着，走了进去。

Shinji lets Asuka do the ordering, and Shinji pays with money Misato gave him. Shinji carries the bucket, and Asuka the side dishes of mashed potatoes, potato wedges, and slaw.  
真嗣让明日香负责点餐，并用美里给的钱付款。真嗣提着桶，而明日香则拿着土豆泥、薯角和凉拌卷心菜等配菜。

Misato was pleased with their selection. She hadn't had KFC in many months. She said fried chicken and beer are a perfect mix. Though everything is a good match with beer for Misato. Her and Asuka almost had a fight over the chicken legs and potato wedges. Shinji thought it was greasy, but good. The flavor was really strong and crispy. He watched in amazement as Asuka cleaned the meat to the bone. Misato drowned her mashed potatoes in gravy.  
美里对他们的选择感到满意。她已经好几个月没吃过肯德基了。她说炸鸡和啤酒是绝配。对美里来说，似乎没有什么和啤酒不搭的。她和明日香差点为了鸡腿和薯角争吵起来。真嗣觉得这很油腻，但味道确实浓郁且酥脆。他惊讶地看着明日香把肉吃得干干净净，连骨头都不剩。美里则把土豆泥泡在肉汁里。

The three gathered together at the TV after Asuka changed into something more comfortable. They watched some sitcoms, and dramas for a couple of hours. Hikari called and talked with Asuka. Misato fell asleep on her chair. Shinji had to help Asuka get her to her room. "Mein Gott." Asuka says. "Does she ever clean up in here." She trips over a beer can. Asuka puts Mistao in bed and Shinji picks up the empties. Asuka stays up to watch television, but Shinji goes to bed early.  
三人聚在电视前，明日香换上了更舒适的衣物。他们看了几个小时的情景喜剧和电视剧。光打电话和明日香聊天。美里在椅子上睡着了。真嗣不得不帮明日香把美里扶回房间。"我的天啊。"明日香说，"她这里从来不清扫吗？"她绊到了一个啤酒罐。明日香把美里安置在床上，而真嗣则收拾起空罐子。明日香熬夜看电视，但真嗣早早去睡了。

Before he walks in his room Asuka says, "Hikari told me what you did?" She doesn't look away from the TV. "Sorry I ran out today, and… thanks."  
在他进房间前，明日香说："光告诉我你做了什么？"她没有从电视上移开视线。"对不起，我今天跑出去了，还有……谢谢。"

"No problem." he says walking in his room and going to bed.  
"没问题。" 他说着走进自己的房间，上床睡觉。

Asuka squeezes the pillow with a soft, kind smile. "_Idiot."_ she thinks in an odd compliment.  
明日香轻轻地捏着枕头，脸上带着温柔的微笑。"傻瓜。" 她心里想，这奇怪的赞美。

The days go by. Most of the classes are done. It's mostly just relaxed around school. Shinji and Kensuke take great pleasure in teasing Touji about his new girlfriend. During lunch Touji chases them around the roof until it starts to irritate Hikari. Shinji enjoys being able to retaliate for all those jokes Touji always made at his expense.  
日子一天天过去。大部分课程已经结束。学校里基本上很轻松。真嗣和健介非常喜欢取笑东治的新女友。午餐时，东治在屋顶上追着他们跑，直到开始让光感到烦躁。真嗣很享受能够反击东治一直以来对他的那些玩笑。

Asuka hardly left Shinji alone in school. When ever Mana just happened to appear in the halls Asuka would make up some excuse for the group to get back to class. Touji tried to make a comment, but was cut off when Hikari stomped on his foot.  
明日香在学校里几乎不让真嗣有片刻安宁。每当绫波丽恰巧出现在走廊时，明日香总会找些借口让大伙回教室。东治试图插话，却被光踩了一脚打断了。

Movie night was Shinji's turn. He picked some old sci-fi horror movie about vampires and werewolves at war. Asuka was a little grossed out. Misato liked the lead actress's pants, and gun play. Misato had even talked Rei into joining them this week.  
电影之夜轮到真嗣做主。他选了一部关于吸血鬼和狼人战争的老科幻恐怖片。明日香有点恶心。美里喜欢女主角的裤子，还有枪战场面。美里甚至说服了绫波这周加入他们。

Thirty minutes after the movie was over the four separated to do their own thing. Asuka was at the table reading a magazine Hikari loaned her. Rei was sitting across from her reading a book. Misato was playing one of Asuka's video games, and getting beaten. Shinji was listening to his music, but was getting himself a drink when the doorbell rang.  
电影结束三十分钟后，四人各自忙自己的事。明日香在桌边阅读光借给她的杂志。绫波坐在她对面看书。美里在玩明日香的一款电子游戏，却屡屡败北。真嗣在听音乐，正要去倒杯饮料时，门铃响了。

"Asuka can you get that I.. think… I almost… got this bastard." says Misato.  
"明日香，你能搞定吗？我…觉得…我差点…就逮住这家伙了。" 美里说道。

"I'm busy." says Asuka. "Shinji get the door." There is a short pause and the door bell rings again. "SHINJI!" she screams.  
"我在忙。" 明日香说，"真嗣，去开门。" 短暂的停顿后，门铃再次响起。"真嗣！" 她尖叫道。

"Yeah?" he says removing his ear piece from his SDAT player.  
"怎么了？" 他说着，从 SDAT 播放器上取下耳机。

"Get the damn door!" "快去开门！"

Shinji finally hears the tone and says, "Coming.". He walks up to the door and opens it. There greeting him is one of his friends. "Hey, Kensuke." Shinji notices the look in his pal's eyes. They are wide and he seems very nervous. "You alright?" he asks.  
真嗣终于听到了门铃声，说道：“来了。”他走向门口，打开了门。迎接他的是一个朋友。“嘿，健介。”真嗣注意到他朋友眼中的神情，眼睛睁得大大的，看起来非常紧张。“你没事吧？”他问道。

"Fine!" Kensuke hollers accidentally. "Uh, I was asked to drop this off. Here take it." he says not even taking a breath between sentences. Kensuke hands over a copy of their school paper and quickly releases it. Shinji looks at the pages.  
"没事！"健介不小心大声喊道。"呃，有人让我把这个送过来。拿着。"他说话时甚至没有在句子之间换气。健介递过一份学校报纸，迅速松手。真嗣翻看着那些页面。

"Oh this is the paper." he says looking at the cover. "Thanks. Do you want to come in?"  
"哦，这是报纸。"他看着封面说道，"谢谢。你要进来吗？"

Kensuke gives a quick shake of the head and starts to run. He bypasses the elevator and takes the stairs. Moving like he was trying to get out of burning building. "_Weird-O."_ Shinji thinks. He walks in the condo and starts to read.  
健介快速地摇了摇头，随即跑了起来。他没有乘坐电梯，而是选择了楼梯。动作敏捷得仿佛要从着火的建筑中逃离。"真是个怪人。"真嗣心想。他走进公寓，开始阅读起来。

In the living room Misato suffers another defeat and gives up. "Shin-chan, who was that?" says Misato. There is a long pause "Shinji?" Still no reply. Concerned Misato gets up and walks into the hall leading to the door. Rei and Asuka watch as Misato leaves and go back to their reading. Asuka can hear Misato talking. "Shinji, you alright? What'cha reading there." There is a moment of silence. "Oh, is that the paper? Gimme."  
在客厅里，美里再次遭遇失败，放弃了。"真嗣，刚才那是谁？"美里问道。一阵长久的沉默后，"真嗣？"仍然没有回应。担忧的美里站起身，走向通往门口的走廊。绫波和明日香看着美里离开，继续他们的阅读。明日香能听到美里的声音："真嗣，你还好吗？你在读什么？"片刻的寂静后，"哦，是那份报纸吗？给我看看。"

"Misato, no!" Shinji says, watching Misato walk away with the paper.  
“美里，别这样！” 真嗣说道，眼睁睁看着美里拿着那张纸走开。

"Oh, don't be shy." Misato walks in with the paper in hand. "Oh, that's such a cute picture of you." Misato laughs as she reads then comes to a stop. She finishes the story in silence. Her jaw falling.  
“哦，别害羞。” 美里手里拿着纸走了进来。“哦，这张你的照片真可爱。” 美里边读边笑，然后突然停下。她默默地读完了故事，下巴都惊得掉了下来。

Asuka looks to Misato. "What's that?"  
明日香看向美里，“那是什么？”

"Nothing!" Misato snaps, trying to hide the paper behind herself. Asuka gives her guardian a suspicious look. She gets up and Misato takes a step back. "Really, Asuka it's nothing important. Let's go to bed."  
"没什么！" 惣流急忙说道，试图将纸张藏在身后。明日香对她投以怀疑的目光。她站起身，惣流后退一步。"真的，明日香，这不是什么重要的事。我们去睡觉吧。"

"It's nine-thirty." Asuka says. Her speed is to much for the inebriated Misato. She grabs the paper and takes it back to her seat. Shinji peaks from the hall. The sight of Mana's name irritates Asuka.  
"现在是九点半。" 明日香说道。她的速度对于醉酒的惣流来说太快了。她夺回纸张，回到座位上。真嗣从走廊里探出头来。看到纸上写着真名的名字，明日香感到不悦。

"'Painstaking investigation'?" Asuka says, with a chuckle. "She asked Shinji last week." She leans back in her seat and continues through the article.  
'精心调查？' 明日香笑着说，'她上周问过真嗣了。' 她靠在椅背上，继续阅读文章。

我们这所不起眼的学校的三名学生，可能就是关键。

首先是一个性格内敛的男孩，却有着坚韧不拔的意志。我指的是

学生。但碇先生仍然继续说着。

Mr. Ikari lost his mother at a very young age. The tragic teen  
碇先生很小的时候就失去了母亲。这位悲惨的少年

碇是一个技艺高超的厨师。葛城女士必定是一位出色的

监护人，才能培养出这样全面且技艺精湛的绅士。

"I knew it. She was making some fluff piece. No way NERV would ever let her print anything in-depth." says Asuka. "Total crap. 'chestnut eyes."? More like dirt brown." Shinji stands, shaking, watching Asuka from the hall.  
"我就知道。她肯定是在写些肤浅的文章。NERV 怎么可能让她发表深入的东西。" 明日香说道。"全是废话。'栗色眼睛'？更像是土褐色。" 真嗣站起来，颤抖着，从走廊里注视着明日香。

"M-maybe you should just stop there?" says Shinji, his voice breaks.  
"或许你该就此打住？" 真嗣说道，声音有些颤抖。

"Shut it, Stupid." Asuka says. "I'm reading."  
"闭嘴，笨蛋。" 明日香说，"我在看书。"

Misato is slowly inching her way to her bedroom door to avoid being noticed. Animals having a heightened sense of danger. Pen-pen dashes for his fridge bed and closes the door. Rei sits quietly.  
美里正悄悄地向卧室门挪动，以免被注意到。动物对危险有着敏锐的感知。企鹅便便冲向它的冰箱床，关上了门。绫波则静静地坐着。

Next we come to one Ayanami Rei, 14, who has been attendiing  
接下来是绫波丽，14 岁，她甚至在碇先生之前就已经就读于  
our school even before Mr. Ikari. Despite this fact little is known  
我们学校。尽管如此，关于她的信息却知之甚少。

绫波经常长时间缺课。当

"She's quiet, yes." says Mr. Ikari. "She risked her own life to save  
她确实很安静。"碇先生说，"她冒着生命危险救了我。

为此，我认为我们都应该向绫波丽表示深深的感谢。

Her motivations are suspect. When this reporter tried to reach  
她的动机令人怀疑。当本记者试图联系  
Ayanami for comment she would only say, "I'll talk with you if I am  
绫波丽进行采访时，她仅表示：“如果我被命令这么做，我会和你谈。”

她有何秘密？比如，她是否佩戴彩色

联系吗？她对碇先生怀有深厚的感情吗？那是她的

Asuka laughs heartily. "That's great. Wonder girl dyes her hair. I never thought about that."  
明日香放声大笑。“太好了。奇迹女孩染了头发。我从未想过这一点。”

"I don't." says Rei, her nose still in her book.  
"我不这么认为。" 丽说，她的鼻子仍然埋在书里。

Asuke under the guaranty of anonymity.  
碇先生。

"I don't know how we're picked to become pilots." says Mr. Ikari.  
"我不知道我们是如何被选中成为驾驶员的。"碇先生说。  
Asuke's selection must be some kind of mistake. Let's hope that  
Asuke 的选择肯定是什么地方出了差错。希望我们的命运永远不会掌握在她手中。

A/N: You have NO IDEA how happy I was to see the positive reactions to that last chapter. I so wish I could of seen your reactions as you read through that last part from when Kensuke shows up.  
作者的话：你们根本无法想象上一章收到那么多正面反馈我有多开心。真希望我能看到你们读到那部分，特别是当健介出现时的反应。

A small few I think missed the point in the article. Originally, I had Asuka making some rather nasty comments during the interview. While they were very funny. I thought that would lessen any sympathy you would have for Asuka. It also makes a lot of those attacks less justified. Asuka may not of been nice to Mana, but she was never so nasty she deserved THAT.  
我认为有少数人可能没抓住文章的重点。最初，我设想让明日香在采访中发表一些相当刻薄的言论。虽然这些话很有趣，但我觉得这会减少你对明日香的同情。同时，这也使得很多攻击变得不那么合理。明日香可能对真娜不友好，但她从未恶劣到应该受到那种对待的程度。  
I really like reading reviews, but if you are going to critique all I ask is you just explain what you feel is wrong in a bit of detail.  
我真的很喜欢阅读评论，但如果你要批评，我只希望你能稍微详细地解释你认为哪里有问题。

**Chapter 7: Affirmation 第七章：确认**

"I don't see what's wrong so far." says Ritsuko, glancing from the paper in her hands. She sits at the lunch table deep inside the NERV cafeteria. Maya Ibuki is reading over her shoulder.  
"到目前为止，我看不出有什么问题。" 说着，律子瞥了一眼手中的文件。她坐在 NERV 食堂深处的午餐桌旁，而真希波·玛雅正从她肩后阅读文件。

"Keep… keep reading." says Misato, waving down. She sits across from Ritsuko. Her head resting on the table buried in her arms. The group at the table is similar to that of a week ago. This time Kaji is sitting up, shaking his head in disbelief; and Shigeru Aoba, NERV control room technician, is sitting with them.  
"继续……继续读。" 美里挥手示意，她坐在律子对面，头埋在桌上，双臂环绕。桌旁的这群人跟一周前相似，只是这次加持正坐直身子，难以置信地摇头；NERV 控制室的技术员青叶也加入了他们。

Ritsuko chuckles, "Twenty-six? I doubt that 'factual error' bothered you too much."  
律子轻笑道："二十六？我怀疑那个'事实错误'并没有让你太困扰。"

"Bitch." Misato grumbles, looking up from her arms. She drops her head again and waves. "Keep going." Ritsuko sits back and continues.  
"泼妇。" 惣流嘟囔着，从手臂中抬起头。她再次低下头，挥了挥手。"继续吧。" 律子往后一靠，继续说道。

"You, Teaching Shinji to cook?" says Ritsuko. "People pray after they eat your cooking."  
"你，教真嗣做饭？" 律子说，"人们吃完你做的饭都要祈祷一番。"

"Oh, Shut Up!" yells Misato. "Save the commentary till the end." There is a short pause and she groans, "I'm tired." Ritsuko takes the hint and starts to read on. Her eyes go wide.  
"哦，闭嘴！" 惣流大声喊道，"评论留到结束再说。" 短暂的停顿后，她呻吟道，"我累了。" 律子领会了意思，开始继续朗读。她的眼睛瞪得大大的。

She reaches the last third of the story. "Oh, my." Ritsuko says.  
她读到了故事的最后三分之一。“哦，我的天。”律子说道。

"Yeah, I know." Misato says.  
“嗯，我知道。”美里说。

Maya clamps her hands over her mouth as she gasps. Kaji, who has already read this, says, "Yep.". Ritsuko and Maya finish the article together.  
玛雅双手捂住嘴，倒吸一口凉气。已经读过这里的加持说：“没错。”律子和玛雅一起读完了这篇文章。

"Pass that over here." says Aoba. Maya grabs the paper, her hands shaking. Aoba takes it from her and he starts to read.  
"把那个递过来。" 相羽说道。真矢抓起纸张，双手颤抖。相羽从她手中接过，开始阅读。

"So,…what did she do?" Ritsuko asks Misato.  
"那么，…她做了什么？" 律子问美里。

"What do you THINK she did?" she says, sitting up and rubbing her temples for a second. "Asuka, just flipped out. She tore the paper to shreds."  
"你觉得她做了什么？" 她坐起身，揉了揉太阳穴，"明日香，彻底爆发了。她把纸撕得粉碎。"

Maya looks to the paper Aoba is now reading. He can be heard chuckling as he reads and those laughs soon stop when he reaches the last third of the article. "If she destroyed it where did you get that?" Maya asks.  
玛雅看向正在阅读的纸张，那是青叶手中的。可以听到他边读边轻笑，但当读到文章的最后三分之一时，笑声戛然而止。'如果她毁了它，你从哪儿弄到的？'玛雅问道。

"Security had a copy they approved." answers Misato. She looks back to Ritsuko. "Shinji bolted into his room, and I could of sworn I heard him moving his furniture against the door."  
安保部门批准了一份副本。" 回答的是美里。她回头看向律子，"真嗣冲进他的房间，我敢肯定我听到他在挪动家具堵门。

"What did you do?" asks Maya.  
"你做了什么？" 玛雅问道。

Misato chuckles. "I followed his lead."  
碇真嗣轻笑一声。“我跟着他的引导。”

Aoba sets the paper down with a look of utter shock. "Damn." is all he says.  
青叶放下纸张，满脸震惊。“该死。”他只说了这么一句。

"She just went into a blind rage." Misato says. "I got worried when I remembered Rei was still sitting out there. So, I took a peak and there she was just sitting there reading while Asuka stomped around the room screaming a bunch of German curses. Some I knew and a few I think she was making up." Misato picks a carrot with her fork and she chomps down on it. "This went on for FOUR HOURS. Eventually, Rei just stood up and walked out." She keeps eating and continues once she swallows. "Poor Pen-Pen. He was still too scared to come out of his room this morning."  
“她突然就暴怒了。”碇真嗣说，“我一想到绫波还坐在外面就担心起来。于是我偷偷看了一眼，只见她坐在那里静静地看书，而明日香则在房间里走来走去，大声用德语咒骂。有些我知道，有些我觉得她可能是即兴编的。”碇真嗣用叉子叉起一根胡萝卜，大口咬下。“这种情况持续了四个小时。最后，绫波站起来走了出去。”她继续吃着，咽下食物后继续说道，“可怜的企鹅。它今天早上还因为害怕不敢从房间里出来。”

"Sounds like this Mana girl needs to be put in protective custody." says Aoba with a smile.  
"听起来这个叫 Mana 的女孩需要被保护起来。" Aoba 笑着说。

"How are the kids now?" says Kaji.  
"孩子们现在怎么样了？" Kaji 问道。

"Shinji was gone when I woke up. I'm not sure if Asuka even slept." Misato says. "She was sitting on her bed when I walked in. She was strangely calm." She shivers and continues, "We had a talk and agreed it was probably best she not go to school." Ritsuko gives her a disapproving look. "What? There are only two days left. All the test are done. They're just keeping the kids busy till the end of the week anyways."  
"我醒来时 Shinji 已经不在了。我不确定 Asuka 是否真的睡过。" Misato 说，"我进去时她正坐在床上，异常平静。" 她颤抖着继续说，"我们谈了谈，一致认为她最好还是别去学校了。" Ritsuko 给了她一个不赞同的眼神。"怎么了？只剩两天了，所有考试都结束了。他们只是让孩子们忙到周末而已。"

"You really just trust Asuka to sit at home and do nothing?" says a surprised Maya.  
"你真的就放心让明日香在家闲坐着什么都不做？" 玛雅惊讶地问道。

Misato gives a sly grin and a wink. "Oh, I'm not that thick. I have security keeping an eye on my place. She can't go to the bathroom without me finding out about it." She sits back impressed with her own plan.  
美里狡黠地一笑，眨了眨眼。"哦，我没那么傻。我安排了保安盯着我家的动静。她连上厕所都逃不过我的耳目。" 她得意地往后一靠，对自己的计划颇为满意。

"Well, you all ready for that meeting Friday in Matsushiro with the UN representatives?" asks Ritsuko.  
"那么，你们准备好周五在松代与联合国代表的会面了吗？" 律子问道。

"I hate these long trips." says Misato. "Why do I have to go? The things are just a bunch of old farts whining."  
"我讨厌这些长途旅行。" 美里说，"为什么非得我去？那些人不过是一群老顽固在抱怨罢了。"

"Because the commanders don't want to go. So they send you." Ritsuko looks to Kaji. "Least you'll have Kaji there to protect you from all those grope happy old men." Kaji looks to Misato and grins.  
"因为指挥官们不想去。所以他们派你去。" 律子看向加持，"至少有加持在那里，可以保护你免受那些色眯眯的老头子骚扰。" 加持看向美里，露出了笑容。

"That's like having the fox guard the chicken coop." says Misato, glaring to Kaji.  
"那简直是让狐狸看守鸡舍。" 美里瞪着加持说。

A moment passes, and her cell phone rings. Misato opens her phone and places it to her ear. "Hello." she says in a cheery tone. She jumps from her seat, slamming her hand on the table. "What!" Everyone looks to Misato. Kaji and Ritsuko are the only ones who don't look surprised. Misato starts talking into the phone with a pause between each sentence.  
片刻过去，她的手机响起。葛城美里打开手机，将其贴近耳边。“喂。”她用欢快的语气说道。她从座位上跳起，猛地拍了一下桌子。“什么！”所有人都看向葛城美里。只有加持和律子看起来并不惊讶。葛城美里开始对着手机说话，每句话之间都有停顿。

"How long ago?" “多久之前？”

"…"

"Wha- How the HELL-? You were supposed to be watching her! Where were your men?"  
"什么——怎么可能——？你本应该看着她的！你的人在哪里？"

"…"

"Ouch. Is he alright?" "哎哟。他没事吧？"

"…..."

"How many stitches!" Everyone at the table cringes. Their imaginations run wild.  
"多少针啊！" 桌边的每个人都皱起了眉头。他们的想象力开始肆意驰骋。

"…."

"Of coarse I want you to find her, you Jack-Ass!"  
"当然，我要你找到她，你这个蠢货！"

"…"

"Where the HELL do you think she's going!" Misato ends the call abruptly. She braces her hands on the table, and she sheds a cold sweat. Misato brakes off into a mad sprint.  
"你他妈的觉得她会去哪儿！" 美里突然挂断电话。她双手撑在桌上，冷汗直流。美里随即疯狂地冲了出去。

The group watches her out and they look to each other. Kaji says "Mount 'Suryu' erupts.".  
众人目送她离开，然后面面相觑。加持说道：“‘Suryu’山爆发了。”

The bright sun masks the dark cloud making it's way to the First Munipal Jr. High School. All day the halls were filled with laughter. People were either reading the paper or laughing about it. Shinji had never felt so uncomfortable. People who normally would never look at him suddenly wanted to congratulate him on his skill. Patting his back and shaking his hand.  
明亮的阳光掩盖了正向第一市立初中移动的乌云。一整天，走廊里都充满了欢笑声。人们要么在读报纸，要么在笑谈。真嗣从未感到如此不自在。那些平时根本不会看他一眼的人突然都想来祝贺他的技艺。拍着他的背，握着他的手。

"Come on people make some room!" Touji said, clearing people away. "Let the hero get to his classes." Shinji and Hikari just gave him a nasty look. Hikari grabbed Shinji and rushed him from the gathering crowd. They could hear Touji making some stupid joke about Shinji giving out autographs after school.  
“来吧，大家让一让！”东治喊道，驱散人群。“让英雄去上课。”真嗣和光只是给了他一个不悦的眼神。光抓住真嗣，急忙带他从聚集的人群中离开。他们还能听到东治在开关于真嗣放学后要签名之类的愚蠢玩笑。

In class the teacher was showing some movie. The only light coming from the windows. The old man, who normally would be droning on about life before Second Impact, was fast asleep at his desk. Seems talking was the only thing that keeps the man from passing out. Students had their desks in small clusters. Touji and Hikari gathered their desks to surround Shinji on both flanks to shield him from the eyes in the room. They had to move Rei's desk with her in to get her to join their gathering. Kensuke is nervously shaking at his desk.  
课堂上，老师正在放映一部电影。唯一的光源来自窗户。那位平时总是喋喋不休地讲述第二次冲击前生活的老人，此刻正趴在讲桌上呼呼大睡。似乎只有说话才能让他保持清醒。学生们将桌子围成几个小圈。东治和光把桌子挪到真嗣两侧，为他挡住教室里的视线。他们还得把零的桌子连同她本人一起搬过来，才能让她加入这个小团体。而健介则紧张地在自己的座位上颤抖。

"How could she do that?" says Shinji.  
“她怎么能那样做？”真嗣问道。

"I told you. I heard she could be a bitch." says Touji. He looks to Kensuke and pats him on the arm. "What's wrong with you?"  
"“我早告诉过你，我听说她有时候挺刻薄的。”东治说。他看向健介，拍了拍他的胳膊，“你怎么了？””

Kensuke flinches. "It's nothing." he says. His eyes filled with paranoia.  
健介一惊，说道：“没什么。”他的眼中充满了偏执。

"Is Asuka…. alright?" asks Hikari in a small voice.  
“明日香……还好吗？”光小心翼翼地问道。

"She was sooo angry, but she's not here. I guess she's staying at home." says Shinji.  
“她当时非常生气，但现在不在这里。我想她应该是待在家里了。”真嗣说道。

"Probably ashamed." adds Touji. Hikari was about to scold Touji when Shinji's reaction catches her eye.  
“大概是觉得羞愧吧。” 东治补充道。光本想斥责东治，却被真嗣的反应吸引了注意。

He clenches his fist. His expression is too hard to read. Is he depressed or angry? "She didn't deserve that." he says.  
他紧握拳头，表情难以捉摸。他是沮丧还是愤怒？“她不该受到那样的对待。”他说。

"All you're doing is complaining." says Rei. "If you want there to be change - take action."  
“你只是在抱怨而已。”绫波说，“如果想要改变，那就行动起来。”

"I need to go out for a bit." Shinji says to Hikari. Out in the halls students are laughing and sharing their favorite quote from the paper. All of them have to do with Asuka.  
"我得出去一会儿。" 真嗣对光说。走廊里，学生们正笑着分享报纸上他们最喜欢的引述，全都与明日香有关。

"Don't fall in, Ikari." Touji says, as Shinji calmly walks out of the room. Touji slides over a seat to sit next to Hikari.  
"别掉进去了，碇。" 当真嗣平静地走出房间时，冬二说道。冬二挪了一个座位，坐到了光旁边。

"I can't believe all those lies Mana wrote about Asuka." says Hikari. She bolts from her seat and slips out the door. Touji looks disappointed as he was just about to slip his arm around her shoulder. He watches the dull movie for about five minutes.  
"真不敢相信万那家伙写了那么多关于明日香的谎言。" 光说着，从座位上跳起来，溜出了门。冬二看起来很失望，因为他正要伸手搂住她的肩膀。他看了大约五分钟的无聊电影。

The mood out in the hall changes. There seems to be a panic in the air. The class room door slams open. A young boy with a buzz cut looks like he has seen the devil. "S-she's been spotted in the building! Soryu's Here!" Boys and girls gasp in the panic. Rei is the only student who has no reaction.  
大厅里的气氛骤变，空气中似乎弥漫着恐慌。教室门砰地一声被撞开，一个留着平头的年轻男孩看起来像是见了鬼。'她在大楼里被发现了！苏龙来了！'男孩女孩们在恐慌中倒吸一口凉气。唯独零是唯一一个毫无反应的学生。

The crowds of students filling the halls part like the red sea. Asuka walks in a quiet rage. No Angel has ever seen this look in her eye. Her hair flows behind her like a fire. No one makes a sound as she passes. Her piercing blue eyes dart back and fourth as she scans the crowds.  
挤满学生的走廊如同红海般分开。明日香带着一股无声的怒气走进来。没有任何使徒见过她眼中的这种神情。她的头发如火焰般在身后飘扬。她经过时，无人敢出声。她那锐利的蓝眼睛来回扫视着人群。

She comes to a stop and the students gasp. Asuka suddenly points to a person just outside of her blind spot. The target is a mousy looking fifteen year old boy. "You!" she says. The boy flattens against the wall by some invisible force. Asuka walks up to him and the other students move out of the way. The boy starts to sweat. "You look like the kind of boy who would know where they make the paper."  
她突然停下脚步，学生们倒吸一口凉气。明日香突然指向她视线盲区外的一个目标——一个看起来胆小怕事的十五岁男孩。'你！'她说道。男孩仿佛被某种无形的力量压在墙上。明日香走向他，其他学生纷纷让开。男孩开始冒汗。'你看起来像是那种会知道造纸厂在哪里的男孩。'

"I-I-Uh." the boy mutters. "I'm n..n..not s… sure."  
"我...我...呃。" 男孩结巴着说，"我...我...不...不太确定。"

Asuka swings a punch that barely misses his head and slams into the locker behind him. She removes her fist to show the metal door is dented. No words. She just glares. The boy glances to the metal crater. "Second floor. Northwest wing." he says.  
明日香挥出一拳，险些击中他的头部，重重地砸在身后的储物柜上。她抽回拳头，只见金属柜门已经凹陷。她一言不发，只是怒目而视。男孩瞥了一眼那金属凹痕，"二楼，西北翼。" 他说道。

Asuka smiles and starts back on her way. Students scatter to clear a path. The mousy boy passes out. Only one jock, three times Asuka's size, is stupid enough to stand in her way. He is left in her wake groaning on the floor, holding his crotch. A single thought runs through her head. "_Dirne sollen wurfel."_  
明日香微笑着继续前行。学生们纷纷让路。那个胆小的男孩晕了过去。只有一个体型是明日香三倍的运动员愚蠢地挡在她面前。他倒在地上，捂着下体呻吟。她的脑海中只有一个念头："Dirne sollen wurfel."

The hall on the second floor is clear of all students. The red head juggernaut comes close to her target. She comes to the door and shakes her head. The room shouldn't of been hard to find. The sign on the door says:  
二楼的大厅里空无一人。红发巨人缓缓接近她的目标。她走到门前，摇了摇头。这个房间本不该难找。门上的牌子写着：

**School Paper Staff 校报编辑部**

She is about to grab the door when sounds of someone yelling comes from inside. She listens to the door. Who ever it is sounds almost as angry as her. "SHUT UP! How could you!" someone screams inside the room.  
她正要推门而入，突然从里面传来一阵叫喊声。她贴近门倾听。无论里面是谁，听起来几乎和她一样愤怒。“闭嘴！你怎么能这样！”房间里有人尖叫道。

Asuka recognizes the voice. She thinks, "_Is that Shinji… yelling?"_  
明日香听出了那个声音。她心想：“那是真嗣……在喊叫吗？”

Mana stands in front of her desk in the room students make the school paper. Shinji holds his ground a few feet ahead of her. A line has been crossed and he can no longer control his own thoughts.  
真名站在学生制作校报的房间里的书桌前，真嗣在她前方几英尺处坚守阵地。界限已被逾越，他再也无法控制自己的思绪。

"What are you complaining about?" Mana says confused. "Everyone in the school thinks you're a hero now."  
“你在抱怨什么？”真名困惑地说，“现在全校都认为你是英雄了。”

"I never asked you to do that!" Shinji hollers. "I don't want it. I'm no hero!"  
"我从没让你这么做！" 真嗣大声喊道，"我不需要。我不是什么英雄！"

"Neither is that bitch, Asuka. I know while she's been here she's never won a single battle on her own.  
"那个婊子明日香也不是。我知道她在这里从没独自赢过一场战斗。"

"Where did you hear that?"  
"你从哪儿听来的？"

"Well, a few kind words, well placed hand, and your lil' friend Aida can be quite the talker."  
"嗯，几句好话，一个恰到好处的小动作，你的小伙伴艾达就能变得相当健谈。"

"_Damn, Kensuke. Hacking on your dad's computer."_ Shinji thinks. "That's not her fault! It's the same for me. I'm no good. I have always needed help. Asuka is closer to a hero then I ever will be."  
"该死，健介。居然黑进你爸的电脑。" 真嗣心想，"这不能怪她！我也一样。我总是不行，总是需要帮助。明日香比我更接近英雄。"

"How can you defend her?"  
"你怎么能替她辩护呢？"

"She at least knows why she pilots! My heart is weak, but her's is strong. She doesn't need me."  
"至少她知道自己为何驾驶！我的心脆弱，而她的心坚强。她不需要我。"

"I've seen the way she treats you. Pushing you around, and treating everyone else like they aren't good enough for her."  
"我见过她对你的态度。对你呼来喝去，对其他人则视若无睹，仿佛他们都不配与她为伍。"

"You don't understand her! That gives you no right to lie about her like that!"  
"你不了解她！这让你没有权利这样诋毁她！"

"She's not your friend, Shinji." Mana says.  
"她不是你的朋友，真嗣。" 真名说道。

Those words cut into Shinji's heart. "I know…. I know she doesn't like me. She may even hate me."  
这些话刺痛了真嗣的心。"我知道……我知道她不喜欢我。她甚至可能恨我。"

"So why would you put up with that?"  
"那你为什么还要忍受这些呢？"

"Cause I'm her friend! She may not care about me, but I care about her! I..I need her, and I wont abandon her." There is a long silence in the room. Shinji turns and walks to the door.  
"因为我是她的朋友！她可能不在乎我，但我在乎她！我...我需要她，我不会抛弃她。"房间里陷入了长久的沉默。真嗣转身走向门口。

"Don't go, Shinji." "别走，真嗣。"

"Just leave me alone." he says, opening up the door, and his eyes meet with Asuka. Her cheeks flush, standing in complete silence. Her anger is gone, replaced by confusion. Shinji realizes she must of heard every word. Her heart skips a beat and she runs down the hall to the stairs. Shinji leans out the door calling after her. "Asuka, Wait!" He hears a muffled gasp from the other end of the hall. He looks to see Hikari standing there, hand to her mouth. The blushing tells him that she must have heard him as well.  
"就让我一个人待着吧。"他说着，打开了门，目光与明日香相遇。她的脸颊泛红，站在那里一言不发。她的怒气消失了，取而代之的是困惑。真嗣意识到她一定听到了每一个字。她的心跳漏了一拍，然后跑向楼梯。真嗣探出身子朝她喊道："明日香，等等！"他听到走廊另一头传来一声闷哼。他看过去，发现是光站在那里，手捂着嘴。她脸上的红晕告诉他，她也一定听到了他的话。

Half hour later a lone girl sits on a bench on the bluff that overlooks Tokyo-3. She closes her eyes as she feels the warm sun. The birds singing in the trees. She's filled with peace and confusion, slowly tapping her feet on the ground. This calm is broken by a soft voice that calls out to her. "Asuka?"  
半小时后，一位孤独的女孩坐在俯瞰东京-3 的断崖上的长椅上。她闭上眼睛感受着温暖的阳光，听着树上的鸟鸣。她心中充满了平静与困惑，缓缓地用脚尖轻敲地面。这份宁静被一个轻柔的声音打破，那声音呼唤着她：“明日香？”

Asuka glances to her right and sees her friend standing there. "Oh, hey."  
明日香向右一瞥，看见她的朋友站在那里。“哦，嘿。”

"You alright? I was worried about you." Hikari says.  
“你还好吗？我很担心你。”光说。

"Class Rep, you worry about everything." says Asuka looking to the flying birds. "That's your problem." She pats on the bench next to her gesturing for Hikari to join her.  
"班长，你总是操心太多。" 飞鸟望着天空中的鸟儿说道，"这就是你的问题。" 她拍了拍身边的凳子，示意光加入她。

"And your problem is you don't talk when you need it." she says, taking a seat. They sit together for a few minutes. Hikari can understand why Asuka came here. It's so calming.  
"而你的问题是你需要说话时却不说。" 她坐下来说道。她们一起坐了几分钟。光能理解为什么飞鸟会来这里，这里太宁静了。

"How did you find me?" Asuka asks.  
"你怎么找到我的？" 飞鸟问道。

"I guessed." Hikari shrugs. "This is… a place we've come to talk before."  
"我猜到了。" 光耸了耸肩。"这里是……我们以前常来谈话的地方。"

Asuka murmurs a sound of her understanding. There is another short pause in the conversation. "Me and Shinji - talked here while we were training together. After I ran off."  
明日香低声表示理解。对话中又短暂停顿了一下。"我和真嗣——在这里一起训练时谈过话。在我跑掉之后。"

"I remember that. I yelled at him to go find you."  
"我记得那事。我冲他吼，让他去找你。"

Asuka chuckles, and says warmly, "That's why? He's such a dork. You have to tell him to do everything.".  
明日香轻笑一声，温和地说：“就因为这个？他真是个呆子。你得告诉他每件事该怎么做。”

"That Mana is such a bitch." Hikari says with venom. Asuka glances to her friend in surprise. Hikari gathers her calm again. "Want to know what happened after you left?"  
“那个万奈美真是贱人。”光带着怨恨说道。明日香惊讶地看向她的朋友。光再次平静下来。“想知道你离开后发生了什么吗？”

"Okay." she says in a removed tone.  
“好的。”她用一种疏离的语气说道。

"The principle found out about all the lies that were in that story."  
"校长发现了那个故事里所有的谎言。"

"How?" "怎么发现的？"

"I told him." "我告诉他的。"

"I didn't ask you to do that you know?" says Asuka a bit upset.  
"我知道我没让你这么做。" 明日香有些不悦地说道。

"I know. I wanted to. No way I was going to let her get away with that." Hikari sets her bag on the ground. "Mana was called into the office. She was told they found out about her lies, and she tried to argue. She said she didn't make up any quotes."  
"我知道。但我就是想这么做。绝不能让她就这样蒙混过关。" 光把包放在地上。"真奈被叫到办公室去了。她被告知他们发现了她的谎言，她还试图辩解。她说她没有编造任何引述。"

Asuka looks upset. "I have never dated any of those pigs at school!"  
明日香看起来很沮丧。"我从来没有和学校里的那些猪交往过！"

"I know. Turns out the boy who said it was Haru Fuso."  
"我知道。结果说这话的男孩是春風遥。"

"Ew, that nerd who smells like he doesn't bath?" Asuka says disgusted. "I don't even like the idea of the rumor that I would touch him."  
"噫，那个不洗澡似的臭小子？" 明日香厌恶地说，"我连听到我会碰他的谣言都不喜欢。"

"She just took that rumor, that he started of coarse, and used it in the story. She knew it was a lie. It just fit into her design." Hikari can't help a smile as she knows Asuka is going to like what will come next. "She was ordered to make an apology. She refused, and was told if she didn't she would be banned from the school paper through her junior and high school career."  
"她只是抓住了那个谣言，当然是春風遥散布的，然后把它写进了故事里。她知道那是谎言。这正好符合她的构思。" 光无法抑制地微笑着，因为她知道明日香会喜欢接下来要发生的事情。"她被要求做出道歉。她拒绝了，并被告知如果她不道歉，她将被禁止参与初中和高中的校报。"

The red head chuckles. "Bet she didn't like that."  
红发人轻笑道：“我打赌她不喜欢这样。”

"Nope. She wants to go to school for journalism. You know they look at your past works when you file for admittance? It wouldn't look too good if her last big story was found out to be full of lies and personal attacks."  
“没错。她想去学新闻学。你知道申请入学时他们会审查你过去的作品吗？如果她最后一篇大作被发现充斥着谎言和个人攻击，那可不太好看。”

"She'd wind up a tabloid reporter, or working for Faux News."  
“她最终可能会成为八卦小报的记者，或者去福克斯新闻工作。”

"Yeah. So now not only does she have to write a special edition for tomorrow. She has to read it over the PA to the whole school."  
"对。所以现在她不仅得为明天写一期特刊，还得通过学校广播向全校朗读。"

Asuka starts laughing. "Oh, that sounds like a blast. Too bad I wont be there to hear it."  
明日香开始笑起来。“哦，听起来真有趣。可惜我没法在那里听到。”

"Wh-what do you mean Asuka? It's the last day."  
"你...你什么意思，明日香？这是最后一天了。"

"I know. I just don't want to deal with it all, or go to jail for murder." Asuka looks to her disappointed friend. "I'll call you. We'll do something this weekend." They both smile and look to the shining city.  
"我知道。我只是不想处理这一切，或者因为谋杀而进监狱。" 明日香看向她失望的朋友。"我会给你打电话的。我们这个周末会做点什么。" 她们相视而笑，望向那座闪耀的城市。

Hikari bites her lip. "I… I heard it all you know. What he said. Have you talked with him?" Asuka just shakes her head. Hikari looks into the trees and sees a mother bird chirping around her nest. "That was pretty romantic." she says, speaking of Shinji's oath to never abandon Asuka.  
光咬了咬嘴唇。"我…我全都听到了，你知道的。他说的那些话。你和他谈过了吗？" 明日香只是摇了摇头。光望向树丛，看到一只母鸟在巢边鸣叫。"那真是挺浪漫的。" 她说的是真嗣发誓永远不会抛弃明日香的誓言。

"Yeah." Asuka says impressed. She catches herself and looks to her friend. "I didn't ask for his help either."  
"是啊。" 明日香赞叹道。她意识到自己的失态，看向她的朋友。"我也没要求他帮忙。"

"I know, but he cares about you, Asuka. So do I."  
"我知道，但他关心你，明日香。我也是。"

"Why would he do that for me? I don't deserve it." Asuka looks to the ground in reflection, and her eyes return to the sky. "Hikari," she struggles with her thoughts. "do… do you think he… LOVES me?"  
"他为什么要为我这么做？我不配。" 明日香低头沉思，随后目光又转向天空。"光，" 她努力整理思绪，"你…你觉得他…爱我吗？"

"No…"

Asuka bows her head in defeat. Memories of her past with Shinji fill her mind. "You're right." she says. "How could he? I've been horrible to him since day one. Always mocking him, hitting him. How could anyone put up with me?"  
明日香低头认输。与真嗣的过往记忆涌上心头。“你说得对。”她说，“他怎么可能呢？从一开始我就对他很糟糕。总是嘲笑他，打他。谁能忍受我这样的人呢？”

"That's not what I meant." Hikari says grinning from ear to ear. "I mean, how could he love you? When you've never even gone out on a date." She starts to giggle.  
“我不是那个意思。”光笑着说，笑容满面。“我是说，他怎么会爱上你？你甚至从未和他出去约会过。”她开始咯咯笑起来。

"Well, there's the arcade." Asuka says with a sheepish grin.  
"“嗯，还有游戏厅呢。”明日香带着尴尬的笑容说。

"That doesn't count. He didn't know it was a date."  
"那不算数。他不知道那是约会。"

"You're one to talk." The two look into each others eyes and share a hearty laugh. "I want to go home." Asuka takes Hikari by the hands and they start to walk back into the city.  
"你还好意思说。" 两人对视而笑，笑声爽朗。"我想回家了。" 明日香牵起光的手，她们开始往城里走去。

Shinji made his way home slowly. He walked out of school just after the confrontation with Mana. He didn't tell anyone he was leaving. Shinji found Pen-pen out of his room digging through the fridge. He tossed his school bag into his bedroom and walked onto the balcony.  
真嗣缓缓地往家走去。他与真名对峙后不久便离开了学校。他没有告诉任何人他要离开。真嗣发现企鹅便便不在房间里，而是在冰箱里翻找东西。他把书包扔进卧室，然后走到了阳台上。

The clouds drifted in front of the sun, casting at large shadow.  
云朵飘过太阳前方，投下一大片阴影。

Some time later he is still outside. Shinji stands on the balcony of his apartment. Quietly, he scans the horizon. Shinji's eyes are filled with confusion. Something that Rei said just triggered something in him earlier. He confessed his heart. He didn't know at the time, but Asuka heard the whole thing.  
过了一会儿，他仍在外面。真嗣站在公寓的阳台上，静静地扫视着地平线。他的眼中充满了困惑。之前绫波说的话触动了他内心的某个东西。他坦露了心声。当时他并不知道，但明日香听到了一切。

"Some friend you are." A voice calls from behind. "At least Hikari was out there looking for me." He turns and sees Asuka, her hands on her hips and brows furrowed. She always looks so much more intimidating that way. "And where do I find you? Standing here and moping like an idiot." she says.  
“你这算什么朋友。”一个声音从背后传来。“至少班长还在外面找我。”他转身看见明日香，她双手叉腰，眉头紧锁。她总是那样看起来更有威慑力。“而我找到你时，你却像个傻瓜一样站在这里闷闷不乐。”她说道。

"A-As-" he says. "A-As-" 他结巴着说。

"Shut it!" Asuka says, hodling out her hand suddenly. She strides upon him with purpose. "How stupid are you? All this time living together." She starts poking him in the chest every few words. "Where the HELL did you get in that thick skull that I would hate you! That I wasn't your friend! I swear if you were any more dense your head would be made of stone." Asuka exhales as if she has just had a huge weight lifted off her shoulders.  
"闭嘴！" 明日香突然伸出手，大步流星地走向他，语气坚定。"你到底有多蠢？我们同住这么久。" 她每说几个字就戳一下他的胸口。"你那颗榆木脑袋里到底是怎么想的，以为我会讨厌你！以为我不是你的朋友！我发誓，你要是再迟钝一点，你的脑袋就该是石头做的了。" 明日香长出一口气，仿佛卸下了肩上的重担。

Shinji looks to her in absolute confusion. He holds on the railing in fear he may fall off and onto the pavement below. "About at school, Asuka. I just want to say I'm -"  
真嗣一脸困惑地看着她，紧紧抓住栏杆，生怕自己会掉下去摔在下面的路面上。"关于在学校的事，明日香，我只是想说，我——"

Asuka is enraged. She cuts him off saying, "Don't You Dare! Don't you dare EVER apologize for that. If you ever apologize for that I really will HATE you.". She strikes him on the shoulder with her opened palm. "Got that!"  
明日香怒不可遏。她打断他说：“你敢！你敢再为此道歉，我绝对会恨你。”她用手掌拍了一下他的肩膀。“明白了吗！”

Shinji nods his head in agreement "Yeah."  
真嗣点头表示同意：“嗯。”

Her expression softens and she smiles. "I never thought you had it in you. Shinji Ikari finally grew a spine." She takes Shinji by the wrist and leads him back inside. "Come on. I'm hungry, and your cooking tonight."  
她的表情缓和下来，露出了微笑。“我从没想过你会有这样的勇气。碇真嗣终于硬气了一回。”她拉着真嗣的手腕，带他回到屋内。“走吧，我饿了，今晚你做饭。”

"Sure." he says. Shinji smiles as he notices her grip on his arm is much softer then he ever remembers.  
"当然。" 他说道。真嗣微笑着，注意到她挽着他手臂的力度比他记忆中的任何时候都要轻柔。

Misato ran inside the apartment forty minutes later, her eyes frantic. She looks like she has been driving around town with her head out the window. "Shinji, is she here!" she says. She glances around, and is shocked by the sight that greets her. Shinji is carrying in a bowl of miso stew. Asuka is sitting on the couch flipping through a magazine, rather then reading it.  
四十分钟后，美里冲进公寓，眼神慌张。她看起来像是开着车在城里兜风，头一直伸出窗外。"真嗣，她在这里吗！" 她说着，环顾四周，却被眼前的景象震惊了。真嗣正端着一碗味噌汤进来。明日香坐在沙发上翻阅杂志，而不是在阅读。

"Welcome home. I was just about to call you for dinner."  
"欢迎回家。我正准备打电话叫你来吃晚饭呢。"

"What's happenin'." Asuka says, casually, raising her hand, not looking from her magazine.  
"什么事啊。" 明日香随口说道，举起手，目光依旧停留在杂志上。

Misato runs her hands through her hair. She walks up to Asuka. "You-you're here?"  
美里用手捋了捋头发，走向明日香。"你——你在这里？"

Asuka glances around and looks to Misato. "Uh, Yeah. I live here."  
明日香环顾四周，看向美里。"呃，对。我住这儿。"

"I know you left. You assaulted a member of security."  
"我知道你离开了。你袭击了一名保安。"

"I didn't know that. I had to go out for a bit, and I though he was a peeper." she says, looking as if she has absolutely no idea what Misato is trying to imply. Asuka looks over to Shinji. "Hey, food ready yet?"  
"我并不知情。我刚出去了一会儿，还以为他是偷窥狂呢。" 她一脸茫然，似乎完全不明白葛城想表达什么。明日香转头看向真嗣，"喂，饭好了没？"

"The vegetables will be one more minute." he says.  
"蔬菜再等一分钟就好。" 他说道。

Asuka jumps from the couch and takes a seat at the table. Misato drops her phone in confusion. Pen-pen walks up to Misato to hand her a beer.  
明日香从沙发上一跃而起，坐到了餐桌旁。美里困惑地掉落了手机。企鹅彭彭走到美里身边，递给她一瓶啤酒。

A/N: This chapter was originally part of Chapter Seven. I cut it in half. I don't like making these chapters too long. Things are really going to start coming together now.
作者注：本章原本是第七章的一部分。我将其一分为二。我不喜欢让章节过长。现在，事情真的要开始串联起来了。

One of my favorite scenes to write in that last chapter was the first one at NERV. I also like how Rei pretty much ignored Asuka. The only reason Asuka didn't turn on Rei with her anger was, because Asuka was in a blind rage.
上一章中我最喜欢的场景之一是 NERV 的第一个场景。我还喜欢绫波丽几乎无视明日香的情节。明日香之所以没有对绫波丽发火，只是因为她当时处于盲目的愤怒之中。

Shinji confronting Mana was a tough scene to write. I know what "I" would do in that situation, but what I would do isn't in Shinji's character. Some people still haven't gotten it about that article Mana wrote. Most of what she wrote about Asuka was a lie. I thought I answered most of that in the last chapter. Seems I have to spell it out for a very small few. Asuka did go to college, she is fourteen, golden-red is her real hair color, she would never of dated a boy from school, she is a great pilot, she's not trying to leech attention from Shinji, and Mana was dressed just as showy as Asuka was.
真嗣与真名对峙的场景写起来颇具挑战。我知道自己在那种情况下会怎么做，但这并不符合真嗣的性格。有些人仍然没有理解真名写的那篇文章。她关于明日香的大部分内容都是谎言。我以为上一章已经回答了大部分问题。看来我得为极少数人详细解释一下。明日香确实上了大学，她十四岁，金红色是她真正的发色，她绝不会和学校里的男生约会，她是个出色的驾驶员，她并没有试图从真嗣那里夺取关注，而且真名穿得和明日香一样招摇。
Chapter 8: Wasted Affection
第八章：徒劳的情感

Misato had eyed Asuka through the first ten minutes of dinner. Eventually, she just let it all go. Asuka and Shinji kept looking to each other from time to time. They felt like that were getting away with something. During the meal Misato went over the situation with her business trip. She was leaving very early the next morning and wouldn't be back till about mid Saturday. She also told them that if they needed anything they should call Ritsuko.
美里在晚餐的前十分钟一直盯着明日香。最终，她还是放下了。明日香和真嗣时不时地互相偷看。他们感觉像是在做些偷偷摸摸的事情。吃饭时，美里详细说明了她的出差情况。她第二天一大早就要离开，要到周六中午左右才能回来。她还告诉他们，如果有任何需要，应该给律子打电话。

"I don't mind if you two ditch school tomorrow, but just promise me you'll stay home till school is dismissed."
"我不介意你们两个明天逃学，但请答应我，放学前你们会一直待在家里。"

"Okay." says Shinji. "好的。" 真嗣回答道。

"'Kay, whatever." says Asuka.
"'好的，随便你。" 阿苏卡说道。

Misato got up to go to watch some television. She looked back remembering something. She says, "One more thing. Don't answer the phone. If Ritsuko calls and finds out I let you two skip all she'll do is bitch me out.". Asuka and Shinji agreed and gathered the dishes. Misato packed her bags, placed them by the front door, and went to bed early. She just asked the kids to keep the noise down for a while.
美里起身去看电视。她回头想起一件事，说道："还有，别接电话。如果律子打电话来，发现我让你们俩翘课，她只会对我发牢骚。" 阿苏卡和真嗣同意了，并收拾了餐具。美里打包好行李，放在前门旁，然后早早去睡觉了。她只是让孩子们暂时保持安静。

The kids silently watched TV for the rest of the night. Shinji was about to enter his room when he was called from behind. "Shinji?" Asuka said in a soft voice. Her hair was down and had just left the bathroom. He turned to look at her. Asuka walked to him slowly. She just looked into his eyes. No words passed, and Asuka suddenly embraced him, resting her head at his shoulder. He was in shock. She wasn't holding him very tight, but he felt his lungs suddenly empty. Asuka says, in a small voice, "Thank you.". She lighty pushed him away and walked into her room.
孩子们默默地看了一晚上的电视。真嗣正要进自己的房间时，被身后的人叫住了。"真嗣？" 阿苏卡轻声说道。她的头发散着，刚从浴室出来。他转头看向她。阿苏卡缓缓走向他，只是凝视着他的眼睛。没有言语交流，阿苏卡突然抱住了他，将头靠在他的肩膀上。他惊呆了。她并没有抱得很紧，但他感到自己的肺部突然空了。阿苏卡用微弱的声音说："谢谢你。" 她轻轻推开他，走进了自己的房间。

He stood there, looking to her door, for a minute till his motor fucntions returned and went into his room to change for bed. The small crack in Misato's door slowly sealed.
他站在那里，望着她的房门，过了一分钟直到自己的行动能力恢复，才走进自己的房间准备睡觉。碇真嗣的房门上那道小裂缝缓缓合上了。

Shinji laid in bed looking to the ceiling and feeling rather proud with himself. Asuka was snuggled under her covers and looking to her red bear fondly.
真嗣躺在床上，望着天花板，内心颇为自豪。明日香则蜷缩在被窝里，深情地看着她的红色小熊。

It seemed a complete shame to stay in on such a lovely day. Asuka was in bed until noon. Her alarm was off, but the chirping birds on her windowsill caused her to open her eyes. She made her bed and propped the bear on the pillow. Walking out she saw Shinji preparing lunch. She said, "What are you cooking, Shinji?".
如此美好的日子宅在家里似乎太可惜了。明日香一直睡到中午。她的闹钟没响，但窗台上鸟儿的啁啾声让她睁开了眼睛。她整理好床铺，把小熊靠在枕头上。走出房间时，她看到真嗣正在准备午餐。她问道：“你在做什么菜，真嗣？”

He seemed a bit surprised she was up. He looked to her and replied, "Oh, I'm making some onigiri, some sandwiches, and chopped fruit. I was just about to wake you."
他似乎对她已经起床感到有些惊讶。他看向她，回答道：“哦，我在做一些饭团、三明治和切好的水果。我正准备叫醒你。”

Asuka stretches. "That sounds nice." she says. She starts walking to the bathroom and an idea comes to her. "Hey, why don't we have that out on the balcony?"
明日香伸了个懒腰。“听起来不错。”她说着，开始走向浴室，突然有了个主意。“嘿，我们为什么不把早餐拿到阳台上去吃呢？”

"Okay." "好的。"

"Cool, I just need to freshen up and get dressed." she says. While she got dressed Shinji had finished the meal and was setting some chairs and a small table outside. Asuka saw Pen-pen was wandering around and took the initiative to put his food in his bowl. Pen-pen picked up the bowl and carried it out to balcony. Seemed he was joining them."Shinji, what do you want to drink!" she yelled out to Shinji.
“酷，我只需要洗漱一下，换身衣服。”她说。当她换衣服时，真嗣已经完成了早餐的准备，正在外面摆放椅子和一张小桌子。明日香看到企鹅 Pen-pen 在附近徘徊，便主动把它的食物放进碗里。Pen-pen 叼起碗，把它带到阳台上。看来它也要加入他们。“真嗣，你想喝点什么！”她朝真嗣喊道。

"Soda!" he answered back from the balcony. She opened the fridge and saw it was two thirds full of Misato's favorite beer, variety of domestic beers, some other brands of ales, and a couple of sodas. "Damn it. I thought Misato was suppose to go to the store yesterday." she thinks. It is then that Asuka remembers that Misato must of forgotten while driving through town looking for her. She grabs a few cans of soda and takes them outside. Pen-pen seemed put out that Asuka hadn't brought him a drink. He waddled inside and came back with a beer. "Pen-pen you shouldn't take that." Shinji says. Pen-pen guarded the can from Shinji's grasp and leered at him.
"苏打水！" 他从阳台上回应道。她打开冰箱，发现里面三分之二都是美里最喜欢的啤酒，各种国产啤酒，一些其他品牌的麦芽酒，还有几瓶苏打水。"该死。我以为美里昨天应该去商店的。" 她心想。这时，明日香想起美里在城里找她时一定忘记了。她抓了几罐苏打水，带到外面。Pen-pen 似乎因为明日香没给他带饮料而感到不悦。他摇摇摆摆地走进去，拿了一罐啤酒回来。"Pen-pen，你不该拿那个。" 真嗣说。Pen-pen 护着罐子不让真嗣拿到，还瞪了他一眼。

"Just leave him alone, Shinji." says Asuka. "I really doubt beer is anything new to the bird."
"别管他了，真嗣。" 明日香说。"我真的很怀疑啤酒对这只鸟来说有什么新鲜的。"

Shinji just gave up and they went back to eating. "Wonder what's going on at school today?"
真嗣只好放弃，他们继续吃饭。"不知道今天学校有什么事？"

"They're probably hearing an earful." Asuka says smiling. Shinji looks confused. Asuka was starting to explain about what Mana had to do to make up for her warrantless personal attack, but Shinji just go upset and said, "I don't want to talk about her.".
"他们可能正听得耳朵起茧呢。" 明日香笑着说。真嗣看起来很困惑。明日香正要解释万那无端个人攻击后需要如何弥补，但真嗣只是变得烦躁，说："我不想谈她。"

Asuka was impressed and rather touched. He was so upset for her. This wasn't pity that Asuka despised so much. It was loyalty. She says "We're free for the day of supervision. We should do something special.".
明日香感到既惊讶又感动。他为她如此难过。这不是明日香所厌恶的那种怜悯。这是忠诚。她说："我们今天没有监督，应该做点特别的事情。"

"Like what?" he asks. He was a little worried.
"比如什么？" 他问道，显得有些担忧。

"I haven't decided yet." The smile on her face told Shinji she wasn't being honest. She had something on her mind, but had chosen to keep him in the dark - for now.
"我还没决定呢。" 她脸上的微笑告诉真嗣，她并没有说实话。她心里有事，但选择暂时对他保密。

They spent the next few hours reading, watching TV, and playing video games. Asuka normally didn't like slow moving games, but joined in on one of Shinji's RPGs. School was letting out and Asuka called Hikari. Shinji started listening to his music just to drown out the giggling and gossip. The two girls laughed over the phone. Hikari was filling Asuka in on all the events at school. Many of the students thought some of the same things about Asuka that were in the story, but the joke today was Mana. Shinji snacked on dried fruits and never took notice that Asuka was looking to him as she talked with Hikari.
接下来的几个小时，他们读书、看电视、玩电子游戏。明日香通常不喜欢节奏缓慢的游戏，但这次加入了真嗣的角色扮演游戏。学校放学了，明日香给光打电话。真嗣开始听音乐，只想盖过她们的咯咯笑声和闲聊。两个女孩在电话里笑个不停。光正向明日香汇报学校里的各种事件。许多学生对明日香的看法与故事中的描述相似，但今天的笑料是关于万奈的。真嗣吃着干果，丝毫未察觉明日香在和光通话时正看着他。

Shinji was sitting alone in the house for a couple hours later. Asuka had gone out with Hikari to talk and get some groceries to cook dinner. Asuka made burgers and reheated fries. She used a tip from Hikari where she put all the seasoning and onions in the center of the patty before she cooked. She called him to dinner and he sat down. He took a bite of a cheese burger and was quite impressed. He says, "These are really good. Something tastes different though."
真嗣独自在家坐了几个小时。明日香和光出去谈话并买了些食材准备晚餐。明日香做了汉堡，并重新加热了薯条。她采用了光的一个小技巧，在煎制前将所有调料和洋葱放在肉饼中心。她叫他来吃晚饭，他坐了下来。他咬了一口芝士汉堡，颇为赞赏。他说：“这些真的很好吃。不过味道有点不同。”

"They're made with beef and sausage ground together." she says. She thought about taking credit for the idea, but it was another tip from Hikari. Hikari had asked the butcher to grind the two meats together.
“它们是用牛肉和香肠混合绞制而成的。”她说。她本想为此创意邀功，但这其实是光给的另一个建议。光曾让肉贩将两种肉一起绞碎。

Shinji had finally made out there were no drinks on the table. Asuka took notice as well and went back to the fridge. She slid open the door, and Shinji heard her say, "Uh, oops.". He sat there with a mouthful of meat and bread. Asuka came back, with an odd grin, holding something behind her back. Shinji swallowed. "What are you hiding?" he asks.
"真嗣终于注意到桌上没有饮料。明日香也注意到了，便回到冰箱前。她拉开冰箱门，真嗣听到她说：“呃，糟糕。”他坐在那里，嘴里塞满了肉和面包。明日香回来时，带着奇怪的笑容，手里藏着什么东西。真嗣咽下食物，问道：“你在藏什么？”

Asuka revealed her secret and set a can of Yebisu beer in front of Shinji. She says, "We're drinking this.".
明日香揭露了她的秘密，并在真嗣面前放了一罐惠比寿啤酒。她说：“我们喝这个。”

"We can't drink that! It's Misato's!
“我们不能喝那个！那是美里小姐的！”

"It's all there is." she says, taking her seat and wishing he would drop it.
“只有这个了。”她说着，坐了下来，希望他能不再追问。

"You just went to the store. Why didn't you get any drinks?" he asks. Asuka looks away and mumbles something. He says in response, "Huh?".
"你刚去了商店。为什么没买饮料？" 他问道。明日香转过头，含糊地嘟囔了一句。他回应道："啊？".

"I forgot OKAY." she snaps. "It wont kill us."
"我忘了，行了吧。" 她厉声说，"又不会要我们的命。"

"Misato might if she finds out."
"如果被葛城小姐发现，她可能会生气。"

"Well, she wont if we don't tell her. No way she could notice a few beers missing from that stock." Asuka opened her beer. She says, "We can get something after we eat.". She was about to take her first taste, and she saw Shinji's unsure look. "We can't go now. The fries will get soggy and the meat will get cold." She looked upset.
"嗯，只要我们不说，她就不会知道。她不可能注意到几瓶啤酒不见了。" 明日香打开啤酒。她说："吃完饭我们再去买点什么。" 她正要尝第一口，却看到真嗣犹豫的表情。"我们现在不能走，薯条会变软，肉也会凉掉。" 她看起来有些沮丧。

Shinji agreed reluctantly. She worked hard on this and didn't want to disappoint her. He opened his beer and took a tentative sip. The bitter taste washed over his tongue. "Agh!" he hollered. "How can Misato drink this? It tastes like piss."
真嗣勉强同意了。她为此付出了很多努力，他不想让她失望。他打开自己的啤酒，小心翼翼地抿了一口。苦涩的味道在舌尖蔓延开来。"啊！" 他大声叫道，"美里怎么能喝这种东西？味道像尿一样。"

"Oh, grow up." Asuka said laughing. She takes a large drink and swallows. Her eyes enlarge and she hollers out, "Mein Gott im Himmel!" She starts coughing, but quickly gains her composer. Beer is very important to the German culture. At that moment she wasn't sure why. Shinji eyes her with disbelief. They both find out the taste isn't so bad if used to wash down their food.
"哦，成熟点吧。" 明日香笑着说。她大口喝下啤酒，咽了下去。她的眼睛瞪大，大声喊道："我的天啊！" 她开始咳嗽，但很快恢复了镇定。啤酒在德国文化中非常重要。那一刻，她不确定为什么。真嗣用难以置信的眼神看着她。他们俩发现，如果用啤酒来送食物，味道其实也没那么糟。

Once they were done eating Asuka got up to clear the plates and staggered. "Whoa." she groans. Shinji grinned. He could tell she was drunk. He got up to help, but his knees almost fell out from under him. "I -don't think we should go out like this." Asuka says. "We might get in trouble."
吃完饭后，明日香起身收拾盘子，却踉跄了一下。“哇。”她呻吟道。真嗣咧嘴一笑，看得出她已经醉了。他起身帮忙，但膝盖几乎支撑不住。“我——我觉得我们不应该这样出去。”明日香说，“可能会惹麻烦。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Asuka got a smile on her face and came up with an idea. "Come on let's watch a movie." she says.
明日香脸上露出了笑容，想出了一个主意。“来吧，我们看部电影。”她说。

Shinji didn't see any harm in it. His slight inebriation didn't help his judgment at all. Asuka came back to the short table in front of the television with chips, pretzels, and more beer. Shinji gave her an odd look. "Don't give me that." says Asuka. "We've already had some. Let's just have some fun."
真嗣觉得这没什么不妥。他那微醺的状态丝毫没有帮助他的判断。明日香带着薯片、椒盐卷饼和更多的啤酒回到了电视前的矮桌旁。真嗣对她投去奇怪的目光。“别那样看我。”明日香说，“我们已经喝了一些了。就让我们开心一下吧。”

"I think we're pushing it, Asuka."
"我觉得我们有点过头了，明日香。"

"Don't be a chicken." Asuka teases. This was the kick in the pants he needed. He snatched at a beer and opened it. Defiant to her challenge. Asuka was pleased and used the remote to input the parental code. They watched a wild and sexually charged comedy. The choice of these salty snack proved to be a bad decision. It just caused them to thirst, and their tongues were now numb to the taste of liquor. Pen-pen looked at them, with his own beer and jerky, like he was making a mental note of all their activities.
"别那么胆小。" 明日香调侃道。这正是他需要的刺激。他一把抓起一瓶啤酒打开，对她发起的挑战表示反抗。明日香很满意，用遥控器输入了家长密码。他们观看了一部狂野且充满性暗示的喜剧。选择这些咸味零食显然是个糟糕的决定。这让他们更加口渴，舌头也渐渐对酒精的味道麻木了。企鹅 Pen-pen 看着他们，自己拿着啤酒和牛肉干，仿佛在心里记下了他们所有的行为。

Every few minutes Shinji would glance to Asuka. She was chugging down the beer as fast as Misato. Soon his gaze was fixed on the red head. Her eyes were starting to droop, and laughing way too hard at the simplest joke in the film. Shinji was chuckling, but not from the movie. "She's looking pretty." he thinks. He was just noticing how cute she was when she laughed. His mind swimming with thoughts.
每隔几分钟，真嗣就会偷瞄明日香一眼。她喝啤酒的速度几乎和美里一样快。很快，他的目光就固定在了红发少女身上。她的眼皮开始下垂，对电影中最简单的笑话笑得太过分了。真嗣也在笑，但不是因为电影。"她看起来真漂亮。"他想。他刚刚注意到她笑起来有多可爱。他的思绪在脑海中翻涌。

Asuka finally took notice that Shinji was staring. She got a goofy grin on her face. She says, "What are you… staring at…, Dork?", and tosses a pretzel at him.
明日香终于注意到真嗣在盯着她看。她脸上露出了傻笑，说道：“你…在看什么…，笨蛋？”，并朝他扔了一个椒盐卷饼。

He flinches and laughs, "Hey… d-don't throw stuff.". Seeing a challenge she grabbed the whole bowl and flung the contents. She fell back laughing.
他一缩，笑着说：“嘿…别扔东西。”看到挑战，她抓起整个碗，把里面的东西都扔了出去。她笑得往后一仰。

Asuka runs her finger around the rim of the can. She says, "This stuff ain't 'alf bad once-".
明日香用手指绕着罐口转了一圈，说：“这玩意儿一旦…还不错。”

"Once you loose all feeling in your mouth." Shinji says laughing, and Asuka joined in.
"一旦你嘴里完全没感觉了。" 真嗣笑着说，明日香也跟着笑了起来。

The movie was now forgotten, and they were finding entertainment in each other. They were talking and then Asuka says, slurring, "Youuu know what I 'ate about youuu?". Shinji seems confused by this statement. Asuka leans over the table and says, "You're 'air covers your EYES." She reaches out and brushes his hair away. "You 'ave those cute eyes and you cover them. It's - ANNOYING. Cut you hair."
电影现在已被遗忘，他们从彼此身上找到了乐趣。他们交谈着，然后明日香口齿不清地说："你知不知道我讨厌你什么？" 真嗣对这句话感到困惑。明日香倾身越过桌子说："你的头发遮住了你的眼睛。" 她伸出手，把他的头发拨开。"你有那么可爱的眼睛却遮起来，真是——烦人。剪掉你的头发吧。"

"N-n-no!" he says. He plants his hands on his head like he was afraid she may jump over the table and start pulling the hair out with her bare hands.
"不——不行！" 他说着，双手按在头上，仿佛害怕她会跳过桌子，用她的双手开始拔他的头发。

"W-why not? I want you to." Asuka pleads.
"为什么不行？我需要你。" 明日香恳求道。

"That's still n-no reason." he says.
"这仍然不是理由。" 他回答。

Asuka drops her head to the table, taps her fingers, and stares at him. She looks like she's waiting for something to happen. Shinji takes a long draw from his beer, nearly falling backwards. "You know - I'm n-not gonna wait for you to ask, you know." she says.
明日香将头埋在桌上，手指轻敲，目光紧盯着他。她看起来像是在等待什么发生。真嗣深深地喝了一口啤酒，差点向后倒去。"你知道的——我不会等你开口的，明白吗？" 她说。

Shinji looks like he just noticed she was there. "A-ask what?"
真嗣看起来像是刚刚注意到她在那里。“问——问什么？”

Asuka seems upset that he didn't already know the answer. "To ask me out on a REAL date, Dummkopf. If I waited for you to ask I'd be as old as Misato." Asuka looks up, and Shinji appears to be asleep. "ACHTUNG!" she hollars.
明日香似乎因为他不知道答案而感到不快。“问我出去，来一场真正的约会，笨蛋。如果我等你开口，我都要和美里一样老了。”明日香抬头一看，真嗣似乎已经睡着了。“注意！”她大声喊道。

Shinji's head bolts up straight. "W-what! Hey, wasn't there a penguin in here? Who - who the hell owns a penguin?" Pen-pen was passed out on his favorite bean bag chair. A piece of jerky hanging from his beak.
真嗣的头猛地抬起。“什——什么！嘿，这里不是有只企鹅吗？谁——谁会养企鹅啊？”企鹅 Pen-pen 正趴在他最喜欢的豆袋椅上，嘴里还挂着一块牛肉干，昏昏欲睡。

Asuka kicks Shinji under the table. This finally catches his attention. Oddly, he barely felt it. She points at him and says, "Y-you're taking me out, S-stupid.".
明日香在桌子底下踢了真嗣一脚。这终于引起了他的注意。奇怪的是，他几乎没感觉到。她指着他，说：“你……你要带我出去，笨蛋。”

"That sounds like an order." he thinks.
他心想：“这听起来像是个命令。”

Asuka takes note of his odd expression, her lip pouts. "You like me don't you?"
明日香注意到他奇怪的表情，她的嘴唇撅了起来。“你喜欢我，不是吗？”

"Yes." "是。"

"So, what you complainin' 'bout?"
"那么，你在抱怨啥呢？"

"No - no. Let's do it."
"不，不。我们开始吧。"

Asuka gave him a goofy grin. She reached over the table again and flicked him across the nose. "Not on the first date, Pervesling." She looks like she has an idea. She stands up, loses balance, and staggers into the kitchen. He hears her giggling and comes back in with red marks on her fingers. She crawls over the table, knocking the empty cans around, and relaxes.
明日香朝他露出了一个傻笑。她再次伸手越过桌子，弹了一下他的鼻子。“第一次约会可不行，色狼。”她看起来有了主意。她站起来，失去平衡，踉跄着走进厨房。他听到她的笑声，然后她带着手指上的红印回来了。她爬过桌子，碰倒了空罐子，然后放松下来。

Shinji looked deep into her hazy, blue eyes. He feels an pain of guilt. Her lips look so inviting. "I need to tell you something." He reaches out and takes her hand. She starts to blush. He continues, "At the ar-arcade. I didn't mean to make you angry. I-I just wanted you to be happy. You're soooo pretty when you angry. Er - I mean happy. Both both. You- you're cute when you're angry too."
真嗣深深地凝视着她那朦胧的蓝眼睛，心中涌起一阵愧疚的痛楚。她的双唇看起来如此诱人。“我有件事要告诉你。”他伸出手，握住她的手。她开始脸红。他继续说道：“在游戏厅的时候，我不是故意惹你生气的。我——我只是想让你开心。你生气的样子——呃，我是说开心的样子，真是太美了。呃——我是说，无论是生气还是开心，你都很可爱。你——你生气的样子也很可爱。”

"Yeah?" she sighs. “是吗？”她叹了口气。

He nods his head. "Yeah. So-so you're cute a lot."
他点了点头。“是的。所以——所以你经常都很可爱。”

Asuka looks like this is the most romantic thing she has ever heard. She starts to go on a rambling sentence. He can't understand her, because she keeps shifting from his native language to German. What ever she is trying to say it seems very heartfelt. Mindlessly nodding his head just seems like the right thing do it.
明日香似乎觉得这是她听过的最浪漫的事情。她开始滔滔不绝地说起来。他听不懂她的话，因为她一直在他的母语和德语之间切换。无论她想表达什么，看起来都非常真挚。无意识地点头似乎是此刻最恰当的反应。

Her lip quivers and she looks like she may just cry. She grabs his collar and pulls him to a kiss. A rather sloppy and unskilled kiss. She breaks the embrace, and his face is glowing red. Looking into his eyes she belches. She giggles clamping her hand over her mouth. Her first words are. "You're drunk, Ikari. Let's go to sleep." Asuka pulls out one of her hair bows and lets it fall to the floor. She pulled out the last one when she saw Shinji lean against the wall and falls on his butt. She couldn't contain her laughter. "HERE let me help you." she says, dropping to her knees between his open legs. Looking into his brown eyes she remembers all the sweet things he's been saying lately. She looses control again and kisses him, planting a few on his neck.
她的嘴唇颤抖着，看起来快要哭了。她抓住他的衣领，拉向他并亲吻。这是一个相当笨拙且不熟练的吻。她结束了拥抱，他的脸红得发亮。凝视着他的眼睛，她打了个嗝。她咯咯笑着，用手捂住嘴。她的第一句话是：“你醉了，碇。我们去睡觉吧。”明日香解开一个发带，让它掉到地上。当她看到真嗣靠在墙上并跌坐在地上时，她解开了最后一个。她忍不住笑了起来。“来，让我帮你。”她说着，跪在他张开的双腿之间。凝视着他的棕色眼睛，她回想起他最近说的所有甜言蜜语。她再次失控，吻了他，还在他的脖子上亲了几下。

"Ohhhh, that tickles, Asuka." Shinji moans.
“哦，好痒，明日香。”真嗣呻吟道。

Asuka was able to help him to his feet and support him to his room. "Idiot, you can't sleep in your clothes." she says.
明日香能帮他站起来，扶他回房间。“笨蛋，你不能穿着衣服睡觉。”她说道。

"Y-yes I can." he says, leaning against his dresser.
“我-我可以。”他靠在梳妆台上说。

"Here look. I'm not." She pulls her shirt off dropping it on the floor. She is now wearing only her bra, skirt, panties, and a single sock. She walks up to Shinji and pulls his shirt off. He's too tired to resist. Even as she starts to fumble with his belt. Blood rushes to his head and he passes out. Asuka reaches out to catch him around the waist, and they both fall on his bed. "Ohhhh, my idiot." she moans.
“看，我不是。”她脱掉衬衫扔在地上。现在她只穿着胸罩、裙子、内裤和一只袜子。她走到真嗣面前，脱掉他的衬衫。他太累了，无力反抗。即使她开始笨拙地解他的皮带，血液涌上他的头，他昏了过去。明日香伸手搂住他的腰，两人一起倒在他的床上。“哦，我的笨蛋。”她呻吟道。

Kaji walked in the front door of Misato's apartment. He's carrying several bags. Misato was right behind him. "Shinji. Asuka. I'm home!" says Misato. There is no reply. She walks into the apartment and notices the plates and left over food on the kitchen table. Pen-pen dashes to Misato and clings to her leg. "You alright, sweetie?" she says.
薰推开美里公寓的前门走了进来，手里提着几个袋子。美里紧随其后。“真嗣，明日香，我回来了！”美里喊道，却无人应答。她走进公寓，注意到厨房桌上摆放的盘子和剩菜。Pen-pen 冲向美里，紧紧抱住她的腿。“你还好吗，宝贝？”她关切地问道。

"Where do you want these?" asks Kaji, holding out all the bags in his arms.
“这些放哪儿？”薰举起手中的袋子问道。

"Just drop them in my room." Misato walks to Asuka's door. She knocks and gets no response. Opening the door her room is empty, bed made. "Huh. Guess she's already gone out." Kaji comes out of the room, and Misato starts gathering up the empty plates. Something doesn't feel right to Misato. She looks to Kaji and says, "Kaji, could you check on Shinji?"
“就放在我房间吧。”美里走向明日香的房门，敲了敲，没有回应。打开门，房间空无一人，床铺整洁。“嗯，看来她已经出去了。”薰从房间出来，美里开始收拾空盘子。美里感觉有些不对劲，她看向薰说：“薰，你能去看看真嗣吗？”

"No problem." he says walking to Shinji's room.
"没问题。" 他说着走向真嗣的房间。

She can hear Kaji calling at the door and she trips on an empty beer can. She lifts it and thinks, "Did Pen-pen steal this?". She notices Asuka's hair bow on the floor. Glancing to the large calendar she sees, on two weeks from today, something is written in red marker and surrounded by a big heart. It says:
她能听到加持在门口呼唤，不小心绊到了一个空啤酒罐。她捡起罐子心想，"是企鹅偷的吗？"。她注意到地上有明日香的蝴蝶结。瞥向墙上的大日历，她发现两周后的日期被红笔圈出，周围画了一个大大的心形，上面写着：

First Date! 初次约会！

"Uh. Misato?" says Kaji standing at Shinji's open door. His eyes fixed on the sight inside.
"呃，美里？" 加持站在真嗣敞开的房门前说道，他的目光紧盯着屋内的景象。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"You remember how you were working on the kids being closer."
"你还记得你之前在努力让孩子们关系更亲近一些吗？"

"Yeah, what of it?" "嗯，那又怎样？"

Kaji points into the room, still not looking away. "I - don't think that's going to be much of a problem now."
加濑指向房间，目光依旧没有移开。“我——现在觉得这应该不会是什么大问题了。”

Confused Misato walks up to Kaji and looks to what he's pointing at. "AGHHHH!" Misato screams. She rushes into the room and stops by Shinji's bed. Kaji walks in a casual stride, but close behind her. Shinji is asleep on the bed, shirtless and his shorts around his knees. Asuka has her arms wrapped around his waist and is cuddled up to him like he is a huge teddy bear. She looked very happy. Both reeked of beer.
困惑的葛城走向加濑，顺着他指的方向看去。“啊——！”葛城尖叫一声，冲进房间，停在真嗣的床边。加濑则悠闲地跟在她后面。真嗣躺在床上，赤裸着上身，短裤褪到膝盖处。明日香双臂环抱着他的腰，像抱着一个巨大的泰迪熊一样依偎在他身边，看起来非常幸福。两人身上都散发着啤酒味。

Misato is running in fingers through her hair frantically, and Kaji looks more bemused and bewildered. "Oh, MY GOD!" Misato says. "Are they DRUNK!" Misato starts pacing back and forth in Shinji's room. Pen-pen is still attached to her leg. The kids don't even twitch. "Oh, OH! This is BAD! This is soooo bad."
葛城焦急地用手梳理着头发，而加濑则显得更加困惑和好笑。“哦，我的天！”葛城惊呼，“他们喝醉了！”葛城开始在真嗣的房间里来回踱步，企鹅依然紧紧地附在她的腿上。两个孩子甚至没有动弹一下。“哦，哦！这太糟糕了！这真的太糟糕了。”

"How can they sleep through all this screaming?" Kaji thinks, as Misato goes into a panic.
"他们怎么能在这尖叫声中睡着？" 加持想着，而美里则陷入了恐慌。

"Why would they do THIS! HOW could they do this! I'm a horrible guardian!"
"他们为什么要这么做！怎么能这么做！我真是个糟糕的监护人！"

Kaji has a sly grin and says, "Well, at least one question is answered.".
加持露出一丝狡黠的笑容，说道："嗯，至少有一个问题得到了解答。"

Misato goes quiet and looks to her friend and lover for the words that will make this all okay. "Huh?"
Misato 沉默下来，望向她的朋友兼爱人，期待着能化解这一切的话语。“啊？”

He points down to the sleeping teens and says, "'Boxers or briefs?'". He gives a small chuckle.
他指向熟睡的少年们，问道：“是平角裤还是三角裤？”他轻声笑了一下。

Misato's blood goes to an instant boil. "THIS ISN'T A LAUGHING MATTER!" she yells. Asuka mumbles and just snuggles up to Shinji's midsection. This draws Misato's attention and she looks closer to Shinji. His face is expressionless, but the color on his lips stands out. "Is he wearing lips stick?" she says pointing.
Misato 顿时怒火中烧。“这可不是开玩笑的时候！”她吼道。Asuka 嘟囔着，只是更紧地依偎在 Shinji 的腰间。这引起了 Misato 的注意，她凑近 Shinji 仔细观察。他的脸上毫无表情，但唇上的颜色却格外显眼。“他是不是涂了口红？”她指着问道。

Kaji leans in for a closer look and replies, "No… I think they were kissing. There's some on his cheeks and neck." He starts to laugh to himself.
加持凑近仔细一看，回答道："不……我觉得他们在接吻。他的脸颊和脖子上都有痕迹。" 他开始自顾自地笑起来。

 Misato gives him a nasty look."How can you be so CALM!"
美里给了他一个不悦的眼神。"你怎么能这么冷静！"

 "Well,… isn't this how we got together?"
"嗯，……这不就是我们在一起的方式吗？"

Misato gives Kaji a slap. "What are you SAYING!" Misato screams, eye wild. "THIS is totally different. We were in college. They're FOURTEEN!" He rubs his sore cheek, and another thought comes to Misato as she remembers the other things her and Kaji did that first time. She slaps her hand over her eyes. "Ohhh, I hope they didn't do what we DID."  
碇真嗣给了加持一巴掌。“你在说什么！”碇真嗣尖叫道，眼睛瞪得大大的。“这完全不一样。我们那时在大学。他们才十四岁！”他揉了揉疼痛的脸颊，碇真嗣又想起她和加持第一次做的其他事情。她用手捂住眼睛。“哦，我希望他们没有做我们做过的事。”

"I don't think so." he says. "Their pants are still on… mostly."  
“我不这么认为。”他说。“他们的裤子还穿着……大部分。”

"Oh, Shut Up! You're No Help!"  
“哦，闭嘴！你一点忙也帮不上！”

"Shhh, You'll wake them." he says, smiling, and trying to calm her.  
"嘘，你会吵醒他们的。" 他微笑着说，试图安抚她。

"This is just so wrong. How could they do something so STUPID as get themselves drunk and fool around like this? How IMMATURE could a person be? I swear."  
"这太荒唐了。他们怎么能这么愚蠢，喝得烂醉如泥还胡闹？一个人能有多幼稚？我发誓。"

Kaji is eyeing her with a silent, confused look. Before he can make a comment the phone in the apartment starts to ring. "I'll get it." he says. "That might be the pot calling." He calmly walks out. Misato looks to the comfortable teens and a devilish plan comes to mind. Kaji can be heard in the apartment answering the phone saying, "Hello, Kettle's Residence.".  
薰用一种沉默而困惑的眼神看着她。在他能发表评论之前，公寓里的电话开始响了。"我去接。" 他说，"可能是锅在叫壶呢。" 他平静地走了出去。美里看着那群舒适的青少年，一个恶作剧的计划涌上心头。可以听到薰在公寓里接电话说："喂，这里是壶家。"

A few minutes later Kaji peaks into the room. "That was Ritsu. She's doing some tests today and needs the kids." he says. "No rush. Just some time before five." Kaji waves his finger in the room. "And no I didn't tell her about THIS."  
几分钟后，加持探头进房间。“那是律子。她今天要做些测试，需要孩子们。”他说道，“不急。五点前就行。”加持在房间里摆了摆手指，“还有，我没告诉她这件事。”

The last piece has just fallen into Misato's evil plan. A wicked grin comes to her lips. "Kaji, get my camera."  
最后一块拼图刚刚落入美里的邪恶计划中。她嘴角勾起一抹狡黠的笑容。“加持，拿我的相机来。”

"Uh, why?" he says, unsure.  
“呃，为什么？”他有些不确定地问道。

"I have a plan." she says.  
"我有一个计划。" 她说道。

"Is this something I'd rather not be an accessory to?" he says, brows raised.  
"这事儿我是不是最好别掺和？" 他挑眉问道。

Misato doesn't answer. She only smiles.  
葛城没有回答。她只是微笑着。

A/N: Now it's been some time since I updated this story. Long story really. I spent some time updating my art work. This past month my internet access has been horrible due out a blackout. There was a nasty storm and trees were blown down all over the city. Took forever for them to get to my neighborhood to check the local connection.  
作者的话：距离我上次更新这个故事已经有一段时间了。说来话长。我花了一些时间更新我的艺术作品。过去一个月，由于停电，我的网络连接一直很糟糕。一场恶劣的暴风雨来袭，城市里到处都是被吹倒的树木。他们花了很长时间才来到我的社区检查当地的连接情况。  
To add on I'm also working on a commission. You may of heard of the Evangelion Fan Fic "After Impact". Well, the author of that story hired me to make some drawings for an audio manga. Basically, paid work comes before this stuff I do for fun. It makes writing a slow process.  
此外，我还在忙于一项委托工作。你可能听说过《新世纪福音战士》同人小说《后冲击》。嗯，那部小说的作者雇佣我为一部有声漫画制作一些插图。基本上，有偿工作优先于我出于兴趣所做的事情。这让写作进程变得缓慢。

I hope you enjoy this chapter. I know a lot are looking forward to this one after the way things ended in the last one. FYI: The events in the beginning of this chapter are roughly based on a real event. You also may notice I edited the last chapter and changed the date of the first date. I thought a two week punishment would be better.  
希望你喜欢这一章。我知道很多人在上一章结束后都在期待这一章。顺便说一下：本章开头的事件大致基于一个真实事件。你可能还会注意到我编辑了上一章，并更改了第一次约会的日期。我认为两周的惩罚会更合适。

**Chapter 9: The Talk 第九章：谈心时刻**

The digital clock slowly scrolled the digits as the minutes passed. The room had become much calmer since Kaji left. Shinji and Asuka were left in bed. The only sounds that filled the apartment were Asuka's sleepy mumblings and cooking in the kitchen. With the stove turned off Misato made her way to Shinji's room. Everything was in place. She had a pain of guilt as she looked down to the comfortable embrace the teens shared. It didn't last.  
数字时钟缓缓滚动着数字，随着时间的流逝，房间里已经平静了许多，自从卡吉离开后。真嗣和明日香还躺在床上。公寓里唯一的声音是明日香睡意朦胧的嘟囔声和厨房里的烹饪声。关掉炉灶后，美里走向真嗣的房间。一切都安排妥当。她低头看着两个年轻人舒适的拥抱，心中涌起一阵愧疚。但这感觉并没有持续太久。

"Wake UP! Emergency!" Misato screamed at the absolute limit her vocal cords would allow. She had wanted to use a megaphone, but then she wouldn't have had her hands free to bash the large, metal spoon into the cooking pot. "WAKEY, WAKEY!"  
“起床了！紧急情况！”美里用尽全力尖叫着，她本想用扩音器，但那样她就无法腾出手来用大金属勺猛击煮锅了。“醒醒，醒醒！”

Both the teens jumped as they were broken from their drunken stupor. Neither had the slightest idea where they even were. "Aghh!" Asuka jerked so violently as she woke up she ejected Shinji right out of the bed. Out of reflex he tried to get up, but with his shorts fallen to his ankles he merely tripped on them and landed face first into the floor.  
两个少年被从醉酒的昏沉中惊醒，跳了起来。他们俩都完全不知道自己身在何处。“啊！”明日香猛地一醒，动作太过剧烈，直接把真嗣从床上甩了出去。真嗣本能地想要起身，但因为短裤滑落到脚踝，他只是绊了一跤，脸朝下摔在了地板上。

As consciousness finally grabbed the two the sharp rapping of the bashing pot split their ears. They clamped their hands over their ears in a feudal attempt muffle the sounds Misato was creating. "Ahhh, Misato. Stop!" Shinji pleads.  
当意识终于抓住两人时，锅子猛烈的敲击声刺痛了他们的耳朵。他们用手捂住耳朵，试图在封建式的尝试中减弱美里制造的噪音。“啊，美里，停下！”真嗣恳求道。

"Stop! Stop it! Gott!" Asuka tossed in bed.  
“停下！别敲了！天啊！”明日香在床上翻来覆去。

"So you can hear me!" Misato carelessly dropped the pot from her hand. The two screamed out in pain. "Now, both of you hurry up and get ready!"  
"所以你能听见我说话！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷漫不经心地松开了手中的锅。两人同时痛得尖叫起来。"现在，你们两个快点准备！"

"Stop Yelling!" "别喊了！"

"Ohhh, Misatoooo." "哦，美里啊。"

"What! Who's yelling!" Misato knew very well after all that drinking they were sure to have one hell of a hangover. Every word must feel like a hammer on the temple. "Now get up! Oh, be sure to eat your breakfast!" Misato waved the two plates of greasy bacon and eggs into their faces.  
"什么！谁在大喊大叫！" 美里深知，经过昨晚的酗酒，他们肯定会有个要命的宿醉。每个字都像敲在太阳穴上的锤子。"现在起床！哦，记得吃早饭！" 美里挥舞着两盘油腻的培根煎蛋，送到他们面前。

The reactions were instant. A red headed flash bolted out of the room. Her hand covered her mouth. Shinji tripped and stumbled behind her. He made it to the bathroom door, but it was locked. The tight burning in his throat could not be mistaken. "L-let me in. Asuka!" He desperately beat on the door. "Please, I'm gonna-" He forces himself to swallow.  
反应立刻出现。一道红发身影闪电般冲出房间，手捂着嘴。真嗣在她后面跌跌撞撞。他赶到浴室门口，但门被锁了。喉咙里那股紧绷的灼热感绝不会错。"让我进去，明日香！" 他绝望地敲打着门。"求你了，我要——" 他强迫自己吞咽。

"Screw you!" Asuka cries out desperately, then the sound of gasping and a splash. The sound was unmistakable and set Shinji off. He couldn't wait. It was coming whether he liked it or not.  
"去你的！" 明日香绝望地喊道，随后是喘息声和溅水声。这声音再明显不过，让真嗣也忍不住了。他等不了了，不管他愿不愿意，它都要来了。

An idea came to him. "_The sink."_ Shinji stumbled into the kitchen and made it just in time to lose the contents of his stomach. The light hurt his eyes and his ears were splitting. The horrid flavor clung to his tongue, and his throat burned as he regurgitated the contents of his stomach. "What did I do?"  
他突然有了主意。“水槽。” 真嗣踉跄着走进厨房，及时赶到，将胃里的东西吐了出来。灯光刺痛了他的眼睛，耳朵仿佛要裂开。那股恶心的味道粘在舌头上，喉咙因呕吐而灼烧。“我做了什么？”

Misato came up from behind him. She pitied the poor child. She went through the very same thing the first time she drank. As well as some time three weeks ago. She grabbed the shorts from around his ankles and pulled them up to their proper position, buckling and zipping them in place. The water was turned on to wash the contents down the drain. Misato grabbed the nearby wash cloth and ran it under the cold water. She ran the damp cloth over Shinji's neck and tried to console him, gently rubbing his back as she convulsed and wept.  
美里从后面走过来。她同情这个可怜的孩子。她第一次喝酒时也经历了同样的事情，还有三周前的那次。她拿起真嗣脚踝周围的短裤，拉到合适的位置，扣好并拉上拉链。打开水龙头，将呕吐物冲下下水道。美里拿起旁边的毛巾，放在冷水下冲洗。她用湿毛巾擦拭真嗣的脖子，试图安慰他，轻轻地揉着他的背，而他则在抽搐和哭泣。

"I'm soo sorry." “我真的很抱歉。”

"I know Shinji." she said in a soft voice. "But, the two of you will be a lot more sorry before this day is over." Misato could here Asuka in the bathroom. She was suffering through the same trauma Shinji was going through.  
"我知道真嗣。"她轻声说道，"但是，你们俩今天结束前会更加后悔的。"美里能听到浴室里明日香的动静。她正在经历和真嗣一样的创伤。

Ten minutes later all the sounds stopped. Misato led Shinji to the kitchen table. She walked to the bathroom door and gave several hard raps. "Asuka, get out here NOW!"  
十分钟后，所有的声音都停止了。美里带着真嗣来到餐桌旁。她走到浴室门口，用力敲了几下。"明日香，现在就出来！"

"I can't I-" "我不能，我……"

"I don't want to here it! OUT! NOW!" she paced out and waited.  
"我不想听这个！出去！现在！" 她快步走出并等待着。

Asuka came out with a washcloth to her forehead and her hair was a mess. She was still only wearing her bra, skirt and single sock. "Sit down!" Misato yells and the youths flinch. Asuka staggers to the chair next to Shinji, that Misato was pointing at. Both of the Eva pilots were sore sights. "I can NOT believe you two!"  
明日香拿着一块湿毛巾敷在额头上，头发凌乱不堪，身上还只穿着胸罩、裙子和一只袜子。"坐下！" 美里大声命令，年轻人们都吓了一跳。明日香摇摇晃晃地走向美里所指的椅子，坐在真嗣旁边。两位 EVA 驾驶员看起来都很狼狈。"我真不敢相信你们两个！"

"Please, don't yell." Asuka gave a week cry.  
"请不要吼叫。" 明日香发出微弱的哀求声。

"My head." "我的头。"

"Well that's too BAD!" Misato was back to her constant screaming. "I can't believe you two actually thought you could get away with it!" She stayed silent for a few moments to let it all sink in. They had no response. Misato put the plates of bacon and eggs in front of them. "Now eat UP!"  
"那真是太糟糕了！" 碇真嗣又回到了她那持续的尖叫中。"我真不敢相信你们两个竟然以为能逃脱惩罚！" 她沉默了一会儿，让这一切都沉入心底。他们无言以对。碇真嗣把装有培根和鸡蛋的盘子放在他们面前。"现在，快吃吧！"

"I can't." Asuka looked on the verge of throwing up again.  
"我吃不下。" 明日香看起来又要吐了。

"Eat up now and every bite, and you better keep it down too!" Misato sipped her beer as she stood watching them eat bit by bit. The smell of grease was unbearable. It also didn't help that this was Misato's cooking.  
"快吃，每一口都得吃干净，而且你最好别吐出来！" 美里啜饮着啤酒，站在一旁看着他们一点一点地吃。油腻的味道令人难以忍受。更糟糕的是，这还是美里的厨艺。

They finished eating. Asuka pushed her empty plate away from her. She held her throat and looked like she wanted to cry. Shinji was close behind as he chewed his rough salty bacon. Once he swallowed Misato set her can down next to the digital camera on the table. "Now that you're both done it's time to discuss your punishment."  
他们吃完后，明日香将空盘子推开。她捂着喉咙，看起来像是要哭出来。真嗣紧随其后，咀嚼着他那粗糙咸涩的培根。当他咽下最后一口时，美里将她的罐装啤酒放在桌上的数码相机旁边。"既然你们都吃完了，现在该讨论你们的惩罚了。"

"What's the big deal we just drank too much?"  
"我们不就是喝多了点吗，有什么大不了的？"

Misato glared at the German girl and watch her go silent. "Oh, you didn't do anything, huh!" She place her hands on the table and leaned in. "Then why is your lipstick all over Shinji's face!"  
葛城美里瞪着那个德国女孩，看着她沉默下来。“哦，你什么都没做，是吧！”她将双手放在桌上，身体前倾。“那为什么你的口红全在真嗣脸上！”

Asuka looked quickly to Shinji. Her color was over his lips, neck, and cheeks. Shinji was desperately trying to look down to his lips to see if there was any color. The evidence was clearly there for Asuka to see. Both started to glow as they blushed.  
明日香迅速看向真嗣。她的唇色覆盖在他的唇上、脖颈和脸颊。真嗣正拼命地试图低头查看自己的嘴唇，看是否还有颜色残留。证据对明日香来说一目了然。两人都开始脸红，羞涩地泛起红晕。

"I also have an informant." Misato stated as she pointed to the floor. Asuka and Shinji looked down to see Pen-Pen on the floor holding out his flippers and making a kissy face to the empty air he was holding. They both had hazy memories, but it was easy to tell what the bird was implying.  
“我也有个线人。”葛城美里说着，指向地面。明日香和真嗣低头一看，只见企鹅彭彭站在地上，伸出鳍肢，对着它所抱持的空无一物的空气做出亲吻的表情。他们俩的记忆虽有些模糊，但很容易看出这只鸟在暗示什么。

"He was drinking too." Asuka says defensively.  
"他也喝了。" 明日香辩解道。

"Don't try and pin this on Pen-Pen!" There was a momentary silence in the room. "You both will be grounded for two weeks." Misato dropped her tone to make sure she was heard. Both looked up to their guardian. School was finally out and the idea of spending the next two weeks confined to the apartment didn't set well with either of them. "You will be doing all the household duties, bed by ten, and you only have five minutes to talk on the phone. On top of that you will be coming to my office to assist with my pile of paper work on Thursday."  
"别想把这事推给企鹅君！" 房间里短暂地沉默了一会儿。"你们俩都将被禁足两周。" 美里压低声音，确保自己的话被听到。两人抬头看向他们的监护人。学校终于放假了，但想到接下来两周要被关在公寓里，他们俩都不太乐意。"你们要负责所有的家务，十点前睡觉，打电话只能打五分钟。此外，你们周四还要来我办公室帮忙处理我那堆文件。"

Asuka's head may have be hiding under her hands, but she tried her best to look defiant. "And if we refuse?" Shinji looked surprised to Asuka.  
尽管明日香可能正用手捂着脸，但她还是尽力表现出反抗的样子。"如果我们拒绝呢？" 真嗣对明日香的反应感到惊讶。

"Asuka, she might double that." he tries to whisper.  
"Asuka, 她可能会加倍哦。" 他试图低声说道。

Misato grinned and says, "I thought you'd say something like that.". She picked up the camera and examined the small display screen.. "That's why I made sure to get this." She set the camera right in front of Asuka. She studies the small screen, Shinji leans in to have a look as well, and it takes a few seconds for Asuka to grasp what she's seeing. A sudden gasp escapes her lips. Her chest sank and the air escaped her lips. She can't mistake that red hair. On the screen is a shot of Asuka in Shinji's bed. She's snuggled up to him. A very happy content smile graced her face.  
Misato 咧嘴一笑，说："我就知道你会这么说。" 她拿起相机，检查着小显示屏。"这就是为什么我特意准备了这台相机。" 她将相机正对着 Asuka。Asuka 盯着小屏幕，Shinji 也凑过来一起看，过了几秒 Asuka 才意识到自己看到了什么。她突然倒吸一口凉气，胸口一沉，气息从唇间逸出。她绝不会认错那头红发。屏幕上显示的是 Asuka 躺在 Shinji 床上的画面，她依偎在他身边，脸上洋溢着幸福满足的笑容。

Shinji was shocked silent. His eyes locked on the girl in his bed, and he wasn't wearing his pants. Asuka couldn't stay silent. "HOW DARE YOU!" The combination of standing and screaming just caused her to weep in pain and slowly drop back to her seat. "You're sick! How could to take pictures like that? What kind of sicko pervert are you?"  
Shinji 震惊得说不出话来。他的目光紧紧锁定在床上那个女孩身上，而他自己却没穿裤子。Asuka 无法保持沉默，"你怎么敢！" 她一边站起来一边尖叫，结果只是让自己痛苦地哭泣，并慢慢坐回座位。"你太恶心了！怎么能拍这种照片？你这种变态色狼到底是什么人？"

Misato pressed the scrolling button. "This one has to be one of my favorites. The image on the screen changed to a close up of Shinji's lipstick covered face. She picked up the camera to have a look herself. Shinji was in such shock he was just staring even though the camera was no longer on the table. His brain must have overloaded by now. "If you refuse to obey my order I'll be sure to have a few of these printed out. Wouldn't it just be 'embracing' if they happened to get around NERV headquarters or your friends?"  
碇真嗣的脸庞占据了整个屏幕，上面涂满了口红。她拿起相机，亲自查看。碇真嗣震惊得目瞪口呆，尽管相机已不再放在桌上，他仍只是呆呆地盯着。他的大脑此刻必定已经超载。“如果你拒绝服从我的命令，我肯定会把这些照片打印出来几张。如果它们不小心流传到 NERV 总部或你的朋友那里，那岂不是‘锦上添花’？”

"You wouldn't." Asuka looked scandalized.  
“你不会的。”明日香看起来震惊不已。

Misato was very serious in her reply. "Just try me." The red head gave in. She was ready to do anything to avoid the scandal those images could cause. "If you both behave I'll let you two off early for your big day."  
葛城美里回答得非常严肃。“你试试看。”红发少女屈服了。她愿意做任何事来避免那些照片可能引发的丑闻。“如果你们俩表现好，我会让你们提前结束，为你们的大日子做准备。”

"What?" Shinji and Asuka say in unison.  
"什么？" 真嗣和明日香异口同声地说道。

Misato gives a playful grin and points over to the large calendar. On the Friday two weeks from today the words "First Date!" was written in red marker and surrounded by a heart. Asuka only now noticed the red marker that was over her hands. She looked to Shinji and he looked back. The pain was gone, and they looked into each other eyes. It didn't last very long.  
美里露出了俏皮的笑容，指向墙上的大日历。两周后的周五，用红色马克笔写着"第一次约会！"，周围还画了一个心形。直到这时，明日香才注意到自己手上沾着的红色马克笔痕迹。她看向真嗣，他也回望着她。疼痛已经消失，他们凝视着彼此的眼睛。但这并没有持续很久。

"Okay, enough of the lovey dovey stuff kids!" Misato was back to her constant screaming. "Both of you get dressed and ready to leave in five minutes! I need to get you to NERV ASAP!"  
"好了，别再卿卿我我了，孩子们！" 美里又恢复了她一贯的大嗓门。"你们两个五分钟内穿好衣服准备出发！我得赶紧把你们送到 NERV 去！"

"But-" Shinji says. "但是——" 真嗣说道。

"Hmm," Misato cuts him off and looked to her camera. "I wonder how long it would take to get this image printed on a t-shirt?"  
"嗯，" 美里打断他，看向她的相机。"我在想，要把这张照片印在 T 恤上得花多长时间呢？"

Asuka bolted into her room and the constant German curses words followed her. Shinji also made his way to his room in a rush. He barely had enough time wash the color off his face. "Hurry up you slow poke!" Asuka shouted to urge him on. Holding her head and she braced herself from her own scream. Misato stood at the door, ready to leave, and counting down the seconds on her watch.  
明日香冲进她的房间，紧随其后的是一连串德语咒骂。真嗣也急忙赶回自己的房间。他几乎没有足够的时间洗掉脸上的颜料。"快点，你这个慢吞吞的家伙！" 明日香喊道，催促他快点。她捂着头，准备迎接自己的尖叫。美里站在门口，准备离开，并看着手表倒数秒数。

Misato drove to NERV headquarters with the same lack of finesse that she usually used. High speeds and erratic turns. Only this time it was all on purpose. The radio was turns on to an unnecessary high volume. The pounding rock music was like a jackhammer to the teens heads. Both Shinji and Asuka sat in the backseat. Asuka laid down holding her head in Shinji's lap. Both clung to their heads and sporting sunglasses. It was a very bright sunny day. "Don't even THINK about puking in my car!" Misato demanded as she saw the look on Shinji's face in the rear view mirror.  
碇真嗣和明日香坐在后座，明日香躺下，头枕在真嗣的腿上。两人都紧抓着头，戴着太阳镜。这是一个阳光明媚的日子。“别想在我的车里吐！”美里从后视镜中看到真嗣的表情，厉声说道。

Her car came to a sudden jarring stop. Misato got out and the other two groaned and more crawled from the backseat. Misato ended the loud noise campaign with slamming the car door shut in the parking lot causing an echo. Shinji collapsed and Asuka held her ears weeping. "Follow me. Ritsuko said it was important." says Misato.  
她的车突然猛地停下。美里下车后，另外两人呻吟着，几乎是爬出了后座。美里在停车场用力关上车门，结束了这场噪音攻势，引起了回声。真嗣瘫倒在地，明日香捂着耳朵哭泣。“跟我来。律子说这事很重要。”美里说道。

The troop walked the halls on the way to the locker rooms when Ritsuko suddenly turned a corner. The surprise on her face was easy to read. "Misato?" says Ritsuko. Her eyes were distracted as Asuka and Shinji slumped past her like zombies. "Well, what are you doing here so early? Didn't Kaji tell you? You could of brought them in any time before five."  
队伍在前往更衣室的途中，律子突然拐过一个弯。她脸上的惊讶显而易见。“美里？”律子说道。她的目光有些分散，因为明日香和真嗣像僵尸一样从她身边蹒跚而过。“嗯，你怎么这么早就来了？卡吉没告诉你吗？你本可以在五点之前随时带他们来的。”

Asuka and Shinji came to a sudden stop. Shinji had a look or disbelief, but Asuka's was that of a weak rage. Misato returned their stares with a triumphant smile. "Off to the lockers now." she says in a sweet tone. "Stay there and wait for orders."  
明日香和真嗣突然停下脚步。真嗣的表情是难以置信，而明日香的则是微弱的愤怒。美里以胜利的微笑回应他们的凝视。“现在去更衣室。”她用甜美的语气说道。“待在那里，等待命令。”

"I can't believe she did this." says Shinji.  
“我真不敢相信她会这么做。”真嗣说道。

"Bitch." Asuka grumbled under her breath.  
"婊子。" 明日香低声嘟囔道。

Looking after the kids Ritsuko had to ask. "What's with those two?"  
照顾着孩子们，律子不得不问道："那两个人是怎么回事？"

"Come on." says Misato. "I'll explain it on the way."  
"走吧。" 美里说，"路上我给你解释。"

Hyuga and Maya could hear the screams coming from just beyond the lab door. "Major Katsuragi! I can't believe you'd let them drink at their age." The voice was unmistakably Ritsuko Akagi. Both looked to the door and away from their work. Misato walked in with an enraged Ritsuko. She was holding her ear and leaning away from her friend. "I can NOT believe you could be so irresponsible to leave alcohol in the hands of minors! Don't you understand what could of happened!"  
日向和真矢能听到实验室门外传来的尖叫声。“葛城少校！我真不敢相信你会让他们在这个年纪喝酒。”这声音无疑是律子·赤木。两人都看向门口，暂时放下了手头的工作。美里带着愤怒的律子走了进来。她捂着耳朵，尽量远离她的朋友。“我无法相信你竟然如此不负责任，把酒精交给未成年人！你难道不明白这可能导致的后果吗！”

"Get off my back, Dr. Akagi! I didn't LET them do anything!" Misato hollered back, finally finding a break in her rant. "Nothing happened. I'm taking care of it." Both came to a stop when they noticed Maya and Hyuga were watching them. Misato exhaled in relief as. "God, I need some coffee."  
“别再揪着我不放了，赤木博士！我并没有‘让’他们做任何事！”美里大声反驳，终于在她连珠炮似的指责中找到了喘息的机会。“什么事也没发生。我会处理好的。”两人注意到真矢和日向正在看着她们，这才停了下来。美里松了一口气，说道：“天啊，我需要来点咖啡。”

"I'll get it." Hyuga says, jumping from his chair to the nearby table. "Anyone else?" Looking to the women in the room.  
“我去拿。”日向说着，从椅子上跳起来走向旁边的桌子。“还有谁要吗？”他看向房间里的女士们。

"Please." says Maya. Hyuga pours three cups of coffee and hands them out.  
"请。" 玛雅说道。日向倒出三杯咖啡并分发给大家。

Misato goes back to the table to get more sugar. "So, what's this test all about? Synch test?" she says.  
碇真嗣回到桌边取更多的糖。"那么，这个测试是关于什么的？同步测试吗？" 她问道。

"No." replies Akagi. "We're looking to refine the manual aim of the Evas with the new rifles. It shouldn't take to long."  
"不。" 赤木回答，"我们正在尝试用新步枪改进 EVA 的手动瞄准。应该不会花太长时间。"

"Can we do the tests out in the GeoFront?" asks Misato.  
"我们能在 GeoFront 外面做测试吗？" 米萨托问道。

"Well, yes we could, but it would take substantially longer. We will need to set up the dummy targets and move some equipment out side."  
"嗯，可以是可以，但那样会花费更长时间。我们需要设置假目标并搬移一些设备到外面去。"

"Then lets do that then."  
"那就这么做吧。"

"Uh, Major?" says Maya. "Why do you want to do the tests outside of headquarters.?"  
"呃，少校？" 玛雅问道，"为什么您想在总部外面进行测试呢？"

"Cause it's nice and bright outside." Misato grins as she sips her coffee. "Be sure Asuka and Shinji do as much of the work as possible."  
"因为外面阳光明媚啊。" 美里一边喝着咖啡一边笑着说，"确保明日香和真嗣尽可能多做些工作。"

"That could add another two hours to the tests, Major." says Hyuga.  
"那样可能会让测试时间再增加两个小时，少校。" 日向说。

"Oh, that's no problem at all. In fact I encourage it." Misato looks to Ritsuko. "Do we need to wait for Rei?"  
"哦，那完全没问题。实际上我鼓励这么做。" 碇真嗣看向赤木律子。"我们需要等绫波吗？"

"No she was already here. She showed up sober as well."  
"不用，她已经在这里了。而且她今天也很清醒。"

"Are you ever going to drop that?"  
"你打算一直这样提这件事吗？"

"Do I ever?" "我有过吗？"

Misato rolls her eyes and presses a button to activate the PA system in the locker rooms. She takes a deep breath and screams into the mic. "Pilots, report to your Evas immediately!" Everyone jumped from the screams.  
葛城美里翻了个白眼，按下按钮激活了更衣室的广播系统。她深吸一口气，对着麦克风尖叫道：“驾驶员们，立即前往你们的 EVA！”所有人都被尖叫声吓了一跳。

"Okay everyone. Grab what you need and report to Central Dogma in ten minutes." says Ritsuko. The techs gathered their equipment and records. Misato walks out with Ritsuko.  
"好的各位，拿好你们需要的东西，十分钟内到中央教条集合。" 律子说道。技术人员们收拾好设备和记录。葛城和律子一同走了出去。

The Central Dogma staff watched over the monitors as Shinji, Rei, and Asuka, wearing their plug suits made their way to the entry plugs. Rei stopped and was talking with Shinji as he passed. Misato watched Asuka stumble in and called out to her through the speakers. "Asuka, lose the sunglasses." To everyone's surprise Asuka made no argument, but the desire for one was easy to see on her face when she pulled them off and handed them to the nearest technician.  
中央教条的工作人员们紧盯着监视器，看着真嗣、绫波和明日香穿着他们的插入栓服走向插入栓。绫波在真嗣经过时停下脚步与他交谈。美里通过扬声器看到明日香踉跄进入，便向她喊话：“明日香，把太阳镜摘了。”令所有人惊讶的是，明日香并未争辩，但当她摘下太阳镜并递给最近的技术人员时，脸上那股想要争辩的欲望显而易见。

"She didn't complain." Aoba says in total surprise.  
“她竟然没抱怨。”青叶惊讶地说道。

"Not a word. How did you do that?" asks Ritsuko.  
“一个字都没说。你是怎么做到的？”律子问道。

Misato whispers to her friend with glee, "I'll show you later.".  
Misato 兴奋地对她的朋友耳语道：“待会儿给你看。”

Five minutes later all the pilots were inside their entry plugs and synchronized. Having their lungs filled with LCL synchronization fluid had never been an enjoyable experience, but today for Asuka and Shinji it was a source of great discomfort. "Well, don't they look chipper this morning." says Kaji as he walks in.  
五分钟后，所有驾驶员都已进入插入栓并同步。尽管充满 LCL 同步液的肺部从未带来过愉快的体验，但今天对 Asuka 和 Shinji 来说，这却是一种极大的不适。"Kaji 走进来时说道：“哎呀，他们今天早上看起来真精神。”

"What're you doing here?" says Misato.  
Misato 问道：“你在这里做什么？”

"Please, do you really think I'd miss this."  
"请告诉我，你真的认为我会错过这个吗？"

"So you're involved in this as well?" asks Ritsuko.  
"这么说，你也参与其中了？" 丽津子问道。

"Guilty." he answers with that coy smile.  
"有罪。" 他带着那狡黠的微笑回答道。

Ritsuko shook her head in disbelief. "You two."  
律子难以置信地摇了摇头。“你们两个。”

Hyuga broke in saying, "The Evas are ready for launch, Major."  
日向插话说：“EVA 已经准备好发射了，少校。”

"Thank you." Misato says. Kaji takes his place next to her. Misato examines the faces on the monitors and yells out her command, "Evas Launch!". The magnetic rails shot the Evas to the ground level of central dogma  
“谢谢。”美里说道。加持走到她身边。美里审视着监视器上的面孔，大声下达命令：“EVA 发射！”磁轨将 EVA 弹射至中央教条的地面层。

The light shone through the plugs screens blinding Asuka and Shinji. "Agh." groans Shinji as he covers his eyes. When the final restraints were released Rei took her first steps to start setting up the cables for the test. Asuka's Unit-02 had to brace against the restraints. Shinji in Unit-01 stumbled and fell to the knee. "You're enjoying this aren't you?" Asuka's question was unmistakably targeted to Misato.  
光线透过插头屏幕，刺得明日香和真嗣睁不开眼。“啊。”真嗣呻吟着捂住眼睛。当最后的束缚解除后，绫波开始迈出第一步，准备为测试铺设电缆。明日香的二号机不得不撑住束缚。真嗣在一号机中踉跄着跪倒在地。“你很享受这个吧？”明日香的问题无疑是针对美里。

"Asuka, stop your complaining." says Misato. "Take the rifles to Rei in Unit-00. Assist her in hooking them to the cables so we can make the adjustments." Looking to the monitor showing the nauseous boy. "Shinji?"  
“明日香，别抱怨了。”美里说，“把步枪带给零号机的绫波。帮她把它们连接到电缆上，以便我们进行调整。”她看向显示着晕眩少年的监视器，“真嗣？”

"I'm never drinking again." Shinji moans. A sudden understanding came to the staff of Central Dogma.  
“我再也不喝酒了。”真嗣呻吟道。中央教条的工作人员突然明白了什么。

"Then you're learning. Now get on your feet and set up the targets. Hyuga will talk you through adjusting the equipment."  
"那么你正在学习。现在站起来，设置目标。日向会指导你调整设备。"

Kaji stood back with a grin as he watched the kids stumble around in their Evas. Misato couldn't hold back the occasional chuckle. Ritsuko just glared at them and shook her head. "You two. I swear." The rest of the staff did their best to hide their own amusement.  
看着孩子们在他们的 Evas 中跌跌撞撞，加持站在一旁咧嘴笑。美里忍不住偶尔发出轻笑。律子只是瞪着他们，摇了摇头。“你们两个，我真是服了。”其他工作人员尽力掩饰自己的笑意。

"So how was the trip, or do I not want to probe any further then I already know?" asked Ritsuko.  
"那么旅行怎么样，还是我最好不要再深入探究我已经知道的事情？"律子问道。

Misato was about to respond until Kaji cut in saying, "Well, speaking of 'probing'.". He was cut off by the sharp glare of Misato and a very disgusted, "Oh, shut it.". Rolling her eyes at how a man a year older then her could be so infantile. Ritsuko laughed watching them.  
碇真嗣正要回答，却被加持抢先说道：“嗯，说到‘探查’嘛……”。他被碇真嗣锐利的目光和极度厌恶的一句“哦，闭嘴。”打断了。碇真嗣翻了个白眼，心想一个比自己大一岁的男人怎么可以这么幼稚。律子在一旁笑着看他们。

Rei was exceptional. She followed direction flawlessly and only needed to be told things once. Shinji had to be told his instructions at least three times. Asuka in a rush jumped a step and had to restart. Fifteen minutes later the tests were ready to proceed. Maya looked from her screen to Misato. "Major, everything is ready."  
绫波丽表现出色，她完美地遵循指示，只需被告知一次。而真嗣则至少需要被重复三次指令。明日香急匆匆地跳过了一步，不得不重新开始。十五分钟后，测试准备就绪。玛雅从她的屏幕转向碇真嗣，说道：“少校，一切准备就绪。”

"Pilots take your positions!" Misato yelled louder then needed.  
“驾驶员，各就各位！”碇真嗣大声喊道，声音比实际需要的还要大。

Shinji caused his Unit-01 to stumble, but Rei grab him by the arm and steadied him to his feet. "Are you alright?" Rei quietly asks.  
真嗣让他的零号机踉跄了一下，但绫波一把抓住他的手臂，帮他稳住了身形。“你没事吧？”绫波轻声问道。

"Uh, yeah. We… I made a stupid mistake." says Shinji. Rei says nothing in response.  
“呃，没事。我们…我犯了个愚蠢的错误。”真嗣说道。绫波没有回应。

Misato could see from the monitors on the screen Asuka was watching the two share this short conversation. Asuka didn't look at all pleased. Her blue eyes didn't move till the two parted and took their positions. "Okay, Doctor. They're all yours."  
美里能从屏幕上的监视器看到，明日香正注视着两人这段简短的对话。明日香看起来一点也不高兴。她的蓝眼睛直到两人分开并各就各位后才移开。“好了，博士。他们准备好了。”

"Thank you, Major." Ritsuko took her place a step ahead of Misato. "I want you three to aim for the dead center on the targets in order. You must hold your aim as steady as possible for three minutes before moving to the next target in order. If you move too far off mark we will have to start again on the selected target." The groans of Asuka and Shinji moved over the intercoms. Rei positioned herself and took aim.  
"谢谢你，少校。" 律子向前一步站在了美里前面。"我希望你们三个瞄准目标的正中心，按顺序来。在移动到下一个目标之前，你们必须尽可能稳定地保持瞄准三分钟。如果偏离目标太远，我们就得重新开始。" 明日香和真嗣的抱怨声通过内部通讯传来。绫波丽调整好姿势，开始瞄准。

Due to the very specific nature of the tests, and condition of two of the pilots the tests didn't go well. Rei was finished right on time. She was long gone while Asuka was on target six. Shinji had just missed up his fifth attempt at target eight. "Asuka I said hold your target in the center. Be steady." chides Ritsuko who was getting more and more irritated with each failed attempt.  
由于测试的特殊性质，以及两位驾驶员的状态，测试进行得并不顺利。绫波丽准时完成了任务。当明日香还在第六个目标时，她已经离开了。真嗣刚刚在第八个目标上失败了第五次。"明日香，我说过要稳住目标中心。保持稳定。" 律子责备道，随着一次次失败，她的耐心越来越少。

"I can't! That artificial light is too damn bright!"  
"我做不到！那人造光太刺眼了！"

"Asuka. " Misato chimes in. "Stop talking back and do as your told." Asuka went quiet, rubbed her eyes and took aim again.  
"明日香。" 美里插话道，"别顶嘴，照吩咐做。" 明日香安静下来，揉了揉眼睛，再次瞄准。

Misato looked back as she heard Kaji leave laughing softly. "See you around ladies." he says. "Work to do."  
美里回头望去，听见加持轻笑着离开。"回头见，女士们。" 他说，"还有工作要做。"

Misato watched the kids struggle. Looking from the boy and girl. "Oh, Ritsuko. I'm going to have to do it."  
美里看着孩子们挣扎，目光在男孩和女孩之间徘徊。"哦，律子。看来我不得不出手了。"

Caught off guard Ritsuko looked to her friend in surprise. "'It'? What are you talking about?"  
猝不及防之下，律子惊讶地看向她的朋友。"'它'？你在说什么？

"You know. IT." says Misato. A calm worry could be read on her face.  
"你知道的。就是'它'。"美里说，她的脸上带着一种平静的忧虑。

Ritsuko was trying to think of what 'it' could possibly be. Her mind quickly went to the one word that Misato used the word 'it' to describe. "Misato, I do NOT want to hear about your personal life."  
律子试图思考'它'可能是什么。她的思绪迅速转向美里曾用'它'这个词描述的那一个词。"美里，我真不想听你谈论你的私生活。

Shaken from this accusation Misato looks to her false blonde coworker. "Not that kind of IT. God."  
被这指控惊到的碇真嗣看向她那位假发金发的同事。“不是那种 IT。天啊。”

"If you don't want me to imply things then get to your point."  
“如果你不想让我胡思乱想，那就直说吧。”

"Well, with finding the kids like that. I'm going to have to give them 'The Talk'."  
“既然发现了孩子们那样，我得给他们讲讲‘那番话’了。”

The understanding final came. "Ohhh. So - you really think you're up for that?"  
终于明白了。“哦……所以——你真的认为自己能胜任吗？”

"No. Got any tips?" “不。有什么建议吗？”

"Do you need a diagram?" she says joking.  
“需要图解吗？”她开玩笑地说。

"That I don't need." Misato chuckles. The mood lightened she starts to ask, "How did your mother handle it?".  
"那个我不需要。" 美里轻笑道。气氛缓和后，她开始问道："你母亲当时是怎么处理的？"

Ritsuko didn't take her eyes off the screen. Her tone drops to ensure only Misato could hear this private conversation. "My mother… Our conversations never really covered personal matters."  
律子没有从屏幕上移开视线。她的语气降低，确保只有美里能听到这场私人对话。"我母亲……我们之间的谈话从未真正涉及过个人事务。"

"Oh." Right in Central Dogma Misato rest her head in her hand, and she closed her eyes to think. A minute later her eyes shot open. "I got it."  
"哦。" 在中央教条区，美里将头靠在手上，闭上眼睛沉思。一分钟后，她的眼睛猛地睁开。"我明白了。"

"Verdammt!" Asuka screams, as she loses her target and has to start over again.  
"该死！" 明日香尖叫道，她失去了目标，不得不重新开始。

Misato escorts the teens inside. Once out of the Evas Misato hardly gave them a minute alone. They have been under her close watch. Perhaps to avoid them making some kind of break for it. She pointed them inside. Misato was still carrying the plastic bag of objects she purchased on the stop to the convenience store. "Okay, both of you inside and sit at the table." Shinji and Asuka made their way to the kitchen table. Asuka was still wearing her sunglasses and holding her head. Misato set the bag down, poured two glasses of water, and set them before the kids. Misato took sodas and bottled waters from the bag and placed them in the fridge.  
美里护送着少年们进屋。一旦离开 Eva，美里几乎不给他们单独相处的一分钟。他们一直处于她的严密监视之下。或许是防止他们试图逃跑。她指着屋内说：“好了，你们两个进去，坐在桌子旁。” 真嗣和明日香走向厨房的桌子。明日香仍然戴着太阳镜，捂着头。美里放下塑料袋，倒了两杯水，放在孩子们面前。她从袋子里拿出汽水和瓶装水，放进冰箱。

"Thanks." Shinji says, taking a long drink. Asuka didn't say anything, but the look on her face showed she was grateful for this act of kindness.  
"谢谢。" 真嗣说着，喝了一大口水。明日香没有说话，但她脸上的表情显示她对这份善意的感激。

Misato stood at the opposite side of the table. She looked at them and reach into the bag. "I know by now the two of you had health classes so you should at least know the bare facts. Still, I don't think that's enough.  
"碇真嗣站在桌子对面。她看着他们，伸手进包里。“我知道你们俩现在都上过健康课，所以至少应该了解一些基本事实。不过，我认为这还不够。”

"What are you getting at?" asks Asuka.  
“你到底想说什么？”明日香问道。

Their guardian braced herself and got right to the point. "We're going to talk about SEX."  
"他们的监护人深吸一口气，直截了当地说：“我们要谈谈性。””

Asuka's sunglasses fell from her face, showing the surprise in her eyes. Shinji started choking on the water he was sipping at. As he coughed to remove the water from his lung Asuka spoke up. "I'm not going to talk about THAT!"  
明日香的太阳镜从脸上滑落，露出了她眼中的惊讶。真嗣正在喝的水呛到了，他咳嗽着试图把水从肺里清除出去。就在他咳嗽的时候，明日香开口了。“我不会谈论那个的！”

"You don't get a vote Asuka. You two have proven you can't be trusted alone. If you and Shinji are getting CLOSER I at least want to be sure you have the right information. I didn't have any adults to give me this information. I was lucky. I had a someone who helped when the time came."  
“你没有投票权，明日香。你们两个已经证明了自己不能单独被信任。如果你和真嗣关系更近了，我至少想要确保你们有正确的信息。我没有成年人给我这些信息。我很幸运，当时有人帮助了我。”

"Kaji?" Asuka asks in a small voice.  
"“加持？”明日香用微弱的声音问道。

Misato didn't respond. "Misato, I promise we wont try anything like that." Shinji pleads.  
Misato 没有回应。"Misato，我保证我们不会再尝试那样的事情。" Shinji 恳求道。

"I'm sorry Shinji, but I also never thought you'd be stupid enough to drink liquor like that. I'm really disappointed in the both of you."  
"对不起 Shinji，但我也没想到你会愚蠢到去喝那种酒。我对你们俩真的很失望。"

Shinji says, "But Misato, there was a reason. If you'd just let us explain." Misato and Asuka were quietly impressed by Shinji speaking up. His tone may have been shaking, but the conviction was noticeable.  
Shinji 说："但是 Misato，我们有原因的。如果你能让我们解释一下。" Misato 和 Asuka 对 Shinji 敢于开口感到暗自佩服。他的声音或许在颤抖，但那份坚定是显而易见的。

"I'll listen later, but right now you two will listen to me. This wont be easy for any of us." Asuka and Shinji shared a glance. This was just something they would have to suffer through. "First off. The only completely safe sex is NO SEX. No matter how many precautions you take things CAN and WILL go wrong."  
"我待会儿再听，但现在你们俩得听我说。这对我们任何一个人来说都不会轻松。" 明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神。这只能算是他们必须忍受的事情。"首先，唯一绝对安全的性行为就是不做。无论你采取多少预防措施，事情都可能而且会出错。"

"If we sit through this will we still be grounded for two weeks?" asks an already exhausted Asuka.  
"如果我们听完这个，我们还会被禁足两周吗？" 明日香已经显得疲惫不堪。

"Yes. Now don't interrupt. Unless you want me to lose my place and start all over again." Misato got the reaction she wanted from them. Asuka bit her lip and Shinji was to afraid to even move. The blood was rushing to his face.  
"是的。现在别打断我。除非你想让我忘记说到哪儿，然后从头再来。" 美里得到了她想要的效果。明日香咬着嘴唇，而真嗣则害怕得不敢动弹。他的脸颊涨得通红。

"Lesson one is about condoms. These are not one hundred percent, but they are FAR better then nothing at all." She reaches into the plastic bag and sets the box on the table. Things were just getting more real by the second. "I'll now show you how these should be used." Misato opened the box as she talked. Asuka was now glowing as red as Shinji. Her mouth opened, but no sound escaped. Misato removed a wrapped condom from the box and pulled a cucumber from the plastic bag. With a condom in one hand and cucumber in the other Misato had a bemused grin on her face. She was getting far too much entertainment torturing these two. "You open the wrapping." Misato tore the condom wrapper with her teeth and removed the round latex. "Place the condom on the tip and gently roll down." As Misato talks she gently rolls her fingers down to surround the vegetable in the prophylactic. Shinji was swaying gently from side to side as he may pass out. Misato presented the covered cucumber. Proud of her demonstration. "That's how it's done." Asuka made a weak grunting sound.  
"第一课是关于避孕套的。它们并非百分百可靠，但远比什么都不用要好得多。" 她伸手从塑料袋里拿出一个盒子放在桌上。一切都在变得越来越真实。"现在我来演示如何正确使用它们。" 说着，葛城美里打开了盒子。明日香此刻的脸红得跟真嗣一样。她张开嘴，却发不出声音。美里从盒子里取出一个包装好的避孕套，又从塑料袋中抽出一根黄瓜。一手拿着避孕套，一手握着黄瓜，美里脸上露出一丝戏谑的笑容。她从折磨这两个孩子中获得了太多乐趣。"你得先打开包装。" 美里用牙齿撕开避孕套的包装，取出圆形的乳胶制品。"将避孕套套在顶端，然后轻轻往下滚。" 她边说边用手指轻柔地滚动，将蔬菜包裹在避孕套内。真嗣左右摇晃着，仿佛随时都会晕倒。美里展示着被包裹好的黄瓜，对自己的演示颇为自豪。"就是这样操作的。" 明日香发出了一声无力的哼哼。

"What is VERY important to good sex is fore play."  
"良好的性爱中，前戏非常重要。"

"Oh, Come ON!" "哦，拜托！"

"M-Misato!"

"Quiet." Misato chirped in a playful tone. "Foreplay is performed through kissing, touching, and oral sex." A simulations groan came from the pair. "Foreplay is kind of like…. Uh, Christmas." The confused looks on their faces showed the absurdity to her of her own comparison. "No wait. That's not right. That's once a year. The point is about giving and receiving."  
"安静。" Misato 用一种俏皮的语气说道，"前戏是通过接吻、触摸和口交来进行的。" 模拟的呻吟声从两人那里传来。"前戏有点像……呃，圣诞节。" 他们脸上的困惑表情显示出她自己比喻的荒谬性。"不，等等。那不对。那是每年一次。关键是给予和接受。"

"Perversling" Asuka softly mumbles under her breath.  
"变态鬼" Asuka 轻声嘀咕着。

Misato looked right to Shinji. "Now Shinji. No matter what if a woman says , 'No'. You stop."  
碇真嗣，你听着。" 葛城美里转向碇真嗣，"无论何时，如果女性说了'不'，你就必须停止。

"_Yeah, like he'd ever have the guts to push anyone to do anything."_ thinks Asuka silently giggling.  
"哈，他哪有胆子强迫别人做任何事。" 明日香心里暗自发笑。

"And Asuka." Misato calling her name got her attention. "If you're too aggressive you're just going to scare the boy, and he's going to think you're some kind of dominatrix." Shinji's silence was broken by a nervous laugh which he instantly regretted. He just stared at the glass of water to avoid the evil eye of the red head to his right.  
"还有，明日香。" 葛城美里叫到她的名字，引起了她的注意。"如果你太咄咄逼人，只会吓到那孩子，他会以为你是某种支配狂。" 碇真嗣的沉默被一声紧张的笑声打破，他立刻后悔了。他只是盯着那杯水，以避开右边红发少女的锐利目光。

"I think next we should talk about the kind of positions. I wasn't sure how I was going to talk about this so I got a magazine." Misato reached in the bag and pulled out a magazine that had an adults only warning on the cover and back. She flipped through the pages and showed these two an image. "This is a good example of one."  
"我觉得接下来我们应该讨论一下各种姿势。我不确定该如何谈起，所以就带了一本杂志。" 碇真嗣从包里掏出一本封面和背面都标有成人限定警告的杂志。她翻开几页，向两人展示了一张图片。"这是一个很好的例子。"

Asuka and Shinji screamed out in shock as they looked to the graphic image on the page. Misato took the magazine back and continued the flip through the pages. She showed them images when something caught her attention.  
明日香和真嗣看到那张露骨的图片时，惊叫出声。碇真嗣收回杂志，继续翻页。她不时向他们展示图片，突然间，她的注意力被某样东西吸引住了。

"This is another one." "这是另一个姿势。"

"This can be really uncomfortable."  
"这真的很不舒服。"

"Oh, this is my favorite."  
"哦，这是我最喜欢的。"

"I NEVER want to find out you tried this."  
"我永远不想知道你尝试过这个。"

On this image Shinji fell from his seat. "Asuka, help Shinji up. We still have a ways to go."  
在这张图片中，真嗣从座位上摔了下来。'明日香，帮真嗣站起来。我们还有一段路要走。'

The talk went on for another fifteen minutes, more images, and several more props. Misato was pleased with her presentation, but was still emotionally exhausted. "God, I need a beer."  
谈话又持续了十五分钟，出现了更多图像和几样道具。美里对自己的演讲感到满意，但仍然感到情感上的疲惫。'天啊，我需要一杯啤酒。'

Misato walks away from the table. Shinji and Asuka are still in a state of utter shock. They are in totally sensory overload. Shinji gives Asuka a shy glance. It took her a minute to gather herself and notice. Asuka looks to the table and back to Shinji. "Don't even THINK about it."  
美里离开桌子。真嗣和明日香仍然处于极度震惊的状态。他们完全感官过载。真嗣羞涩地看了明日香一眼。她花了一分钟才回过神来注意到。明日香看向桌子，然后又看向真嗣。'连想都别想。'

The first week of their punishment was intolerable for Shinji and Asuka. Misato treated them both as indentured servants. They filed paperwork, cleaned the house, Pen-Pen's room, cooked dinner, washed clothes, and gave Misato back rubs and foot rubs. Shinji was the best at the foot rubs, but Misato took great pleasure in seeing the look on Asuka's face when she called her for her foot rub. Pen-Pen got into the act as well, waving his webbed foot before Asuka and Shinji. She never wanted this two weeks to end. The chore calendar, which normally would be a random selection of Misato, Shinji, and Asuka's names, was now absent one name for a two weeks stretch, Misato.  
对于真嗣和明日香来说，惩罚的第一周简直难以忍受。美里把他们俩当作了契约仆人。他们处理文件，打扫房子，清理企鹅 PEN-PEN 的房间，做饭，洗衣服，还给美里做背部和足部按摩。真嗣最擅长足部按摩，但美里特别喜欢看到明日香被叫去做足部按摩时的表情。PEN-PEN 也加入了这场闹剧，挥动着它的蹼足在明日香和真嗣面前。她从未希望这两周结束。家务日历上，通常是美里、真嗣和明日香的名字随机排列，现在却有两周的时间空出了一格，那是美里的名字。

Misato had been out of the house for a few hours. Shinji had just finished up cleaning the bathroom, and he collapsed on the couch. "Done!" he groans.  
美里已经离家几个小时了。真嗣刚打扫完浴室，瘫倒在沙发上。“终于搞定了！”他呻吟道。

Asuka relaxes on the floor, impatiently tapping her television remote on the coffee table. "I've had it with this crap." she says, slamming the remote on the table. Shinji looks up from his nap. "Shinji, it's time we put an end to this!"  
明日香躺在地板上，不耐烦地用电视遥控器敲打着咖啡桌。“我受够了这些破事。”她说着，将遥控器重重地摔在桌上。真嗣从午睡中惊醒。“真嗣，是时候结束这一切了！”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Asuka stands and pulls him from the couch. "I need you to watch my back."  
明日香站起来，将他从沙发上拉起。“我需要你帮我看着点。”

"What are you talking about?"  
“你在说什么呢？”

Asuka opens the door to Misato's room. "You stand watch."  
明日香打开了美里房间的门。“你来放哨。”

"Asuka, STOP!" he pleads. "If Misato comes home and finds you snooping in her room we'll get into more trouble."  
"明日香，停下！" 他恳求道，"如果美里回来发现你在翻她的房间，我们会有更大的麻烦。"

"That's why your on WATCH, Idiot." She sneered. "Keep an eye out. If you hear her coming give a shout." Asuka disappears behind the sliding door.  
"所以你才要放风啊，笨蛋。" 她嘲讽道，"注意外面。要是听到她回来了就喊一声。" 明日香随即消失在滑动门后。

Asuka looks around the room. Clothes scattered everywhere. It seems impossible how she can tell the clean from the soiled clothes. Asuka searched for the through a pile of clothes and couldn't find anything, then right on the table was her prize, the digital camera that contains the incriminating pictures. "_Too easy."_ she thinks. She grabs the camera and checks the view screen on the back.. A variety of pictures toggles by. Many look like vacation pictures. One picture catches her attention. A picture of Kaji from the back. Pressing the button again Asuka finds another picture of Kaji's back, but this one is a close up of his butt. She enjoys a shy moment on this image when she forces herself to keep looking. A few more images go by. She's getting impatient when something catches her eye. A picture of Misato. She has a triumphant, playful smile and holding a sign written in German. The sign translates simply to:  
明日香环顾房间，衣物散落一地。她难以想象美里是如何区分干净与脏衣服的。明日香在一堆衣物中搜寻无果，却在桌子上发现了她的目标——那台存有罪证照片的数码相机。"太简单了。" 她心想。她拿起相机，查看背面的显示屏。一系列照片轮番显示，大多是度假照片。其中一张吸引了她的注意，是背面拍摄的加持的照片。再次按下按钮，明日香发现另一张加持背部的特写，这次是他的臀部。她对着这张照片羞涩地笑了笑，强迫自己继续查看。又过了几张照片，她开始不耐烦，这时一张照片吸引了她的目光——是美里的照片。她带着胜利而俏皮的微笑，手持一块用德语写的牌子。牌子上简单翻译过来是：

**Looking for this! 正在找这个！**

Asuka zooms the view finder to see what Misato is holding in her free hand. A camera memory card. Pressing the button once more. The last picture on this card is another of Misato. Holding the same memory card and motioning as if dropping it into her pants.  
明日香将取景器放大，想看看美里空着的那只手里拿着什么。是一张相机存储卡。再次按下按钮，这张卡上的最后一张照片是美里，她手里拿着同一张存储卡，动作像是要把它塞进裤子里。

Outside the room Shinji holds his guard. His eyes focused on the hallway leading to the front door. The silence is finally broken from a scream inside Misato's room. "VERDAMMT!"  
房间外，真嗣保持着警戒，目光紧盯着通往大门的走廊。终于，美里房间内传来的一声尖叫打破了沉默。“该死！”
