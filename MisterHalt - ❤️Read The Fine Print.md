### Chapter 01 Just Call Me Agatha

The mid-morning sun beat down on a small house on the outskirts of Fujikawa. In the guest bedroom of that house, a young brown-haired boy stood at his window, searching the sky for any sign of clouds. He gave up after a minute, and resigned himself to another uncomfortably warm day as he sat back down at his desk.
上午的阳光火辣辣地照射在富士川郊外的一座小屋上。屋内的客房里，一个棕色头发的少年站在窗前，抬头寻找天空中的云彩。一分钟后，他放弃了寻找，坐回桌前，无奈地准备迎接又一个酷热难耐的日子。

As part of his teacher's effort to help him learn another language, Shinji was now staring at a piece of paper on his desk with only two words on it.
在老师帮助他学习新语言的过程中，真嗣此刻正凝视着桌上的纸张，上面仅写着两个词。

Dear Pen-pal, 亲爱的笔友：

Shinji had quickly become able to speak the language well enough that his teacher called it 'fluent enough to get by', despite the fact that the boy had started later in life than was recommended for teaching a child a new language. The old man then remarked that a Japanese accent made the language sound a little strange to his ears.
真嗣迅速掌握了这门语言，达到了老师所说的“足以应对日常交流的流利程度”，尽管他开始学习的时间比通常推荐的要晚。老人接着指出，日本口音让这门语言在他听来略显奇特。

Shinji knew the language enough to be able to write clearly, even if he did make quite a few mistakes, but he simply didn't know how to talk to somebody he'd never met. After all, he knew literally nothing about the person who would be receiving this letter. His teacher refused to give any hints, stating that it was better to learn about a person from that person. Shinji didn't even know if the person he was writing to was a girl or another boy.
真嗣对这门语言掌握得还算不错，能写出清晰的文章，尽管错误不少，但他实在不知道该如何与素未谋面的人交谈。毕竟，他对收信人一无所知。老师拒绝提供任何提示，认为最好是通过对方来了解对方。真嗣连对方是男是女都不清楚。

My name is Shinji Ikari. I am writing to you from Japan.
我叫碇真嗣，现在从日本给您写信。

He decided to start with the easy bits, his name and where he was from, but hit a wall again. What was 'supposed' to come next? After staring at the paper for ten minutes with no progress made, he eventually got up and looked for his teacher.
他决定先从简单的内容入手，写下自己的名字和籍贯，然而又陷入了困境。接下来该写什么呢？凝视着纸张十分钟却毫无进展，他只好起身去找老师求助。

"Having trouble?" the old man asked as he glanced over his book at Shinji. There was no television in the house; the old man kept himself occupied by teaching his student, reading, or tending the small garden behind their house.
"遇到困难了吗？"老人从书本上抬起头，关切地望向真嗣。家中没有电视，老人平日里要么教学生，要么沉浸在书海，或是照料屋后那片小花园。

"Yes sir. I don't know what to write about," Shinji replied. "I know you're not going to tell me about them, but..."
是的，先生。我真不知道该写什么好，" 真嗣回答说，"虽然我知道您不会透露关于他们的事，但是……

"Since you don't know the person yet," the teacher gently interrupted, "why not tell them a few things about yourself? Get the ball rolling, so to speak. That way your pen-pal will also have things to respond to when they write their own letter back. But since it's your first letter, don't try and cram your life story in. You can tell them more about yourself as time goes on."
既然你还不熟悉对方，"老师温和地插话，"不妨先分享一些自己的事情，算是抛砖引玉。这样，你的笔友回信时也有话可说。但作为初次通信，不必急于倾诉所有，随着交流的深入，你可以慢慢讲述更多关于自己的故事。

After a moment's thought, Shinji nodded and thanked his teacher before returning to the letter. The words came a little easier now that he had something to write about, even if he did feel like it was rather narcissistic to talk about himself so much.
沉思片刻后，真嗣点头向老师致谢，随即继续写信。有了具体话题，笔下文字流畅不少，尽管他觉得过多谈论自己显得有些自恋。

I am seven years old and living with a teacher where I am home-schooled...
我今年七岁，与一位老师同住，正在接受家庭教育...

After an hour of slowly writing the rest of the letter, Shinji got up and went back to his teacher.
经过一个小时的缓慢书写，信的其余部分终于完成，真嗣站起身，回到老师身边。

"Done? Let me take a look then." The old man moved to his desk where he uncapped a red pen and started to read, circling every mistake he found. Several minutes passed before he handed the letter back. "Correct these errors, then it will be ready to send. Oh, and you can drop your last name from the introduction. No need to be so formal. They're a pen-pal, not a CEO."
写完了吗？我来看看。"老人移步至桌边，拧开红笔开始审阅，细心圈出每处错误。片刻后，他将信件递还，"修正这些错误，信就可以寄出了。对了，开头不必写全名，去掉姓氏吧，毕竟对方只是笔友，无需过于正式。

Shinji didn't know what a 'CEO' was, but he got the point. Once it was completed to the satisfaction of his teacher, he licked the envelope flap and sealed it up. He then wrote the address he was given on the envelope, and the teacher and his student went out together to post it.
真嗣不清楚'CEO'的含义，但他领会了要点。作业得到老师认可后，他舔湿信封封口并封好。接着，他在信封上写下了老师给的地址，随后师生二人一同出门去寄信。

As the envelope slid into the mailbox and the lid slammed shut, Shinji fervently hoped that his new pen-pal wouldn't hate it.
信封滑入邮筒，盖子随之砰然关闭，真嗣心中默默祈祷，希望这位新笔友不会对信件内容感到反感。

XXX

With every day that passed, Shinji's nervousness slowly grew. He tried to keep himself occupied by putting more effort into his studies, but soon found himself out of homework and admonished by his teacher to 'take a break'.
随着日子一天天过去，真嗣的紧张感日益加剧。他试图通过加倍努力学习来分散注意力，然而不久便无作业可做，反被老师提醒要'适当休息'。

So he decided to go out into the garden and help his teacher by doing some weeding. Within ten minutes he was back inside holding his arm under the kitchen tap where an errant rose thorn had gouged a nasty line in it. The next day his teacher handed him a long pair of gardening gloves and told him to be more careful.
于是他决定去花园帮忙，通过除草来协助老师。不到十分钟，他便回到屋内，在厨房水龙头下冲洗着被一根顽皮的玫瑰刺划伤的胳膊。次日，老师递给他一副长款园艺手套，并叮嘱他务必更加小心。

Just when it seemed to him that the person had decided not to bother replying, a letter landed on his desk. Shinji stared at it for a moment, then up at his teacher. The man gave a little smile before returning to his chair and book.
正当他以为对方不打算回复时，一封信突然落在了他的桌上。真嗣凝视了片刻，随即抬头望向老师。老师微微一笑，接着坐回椅子，继续埋头于书本之中。

The young boy had to take a minute and several long breaths before he felt up to opening the letter, which he did with the utmost care.
年轻的男孩深吸了几口气，稍作停顿后，才小心翼翼地打开了那封信。

Dear Shinji, 真嗣，你好，

Apparently I'm not allowed to tell you my real name. Security or something. For now, just call me Agatha.
看来我不能透露真名，可能是出于安全考虑。暂时叫我阿加莎就好。

He slowly read the letter out loud, stumbling over some of the longer words.
他缓缓地朗读着信件，碰到长词时略显磕绊。

I'm also not allowed to tell you about what I do, which I only found out after writing the first letter. They could have told me before, but I appear to be surrounded by the dumbest smart people in the history of IT. So in a way this is already the second letter I'm writing to you.
我也无法透露我的工作内容，这是在寄出第一封信后才被告知的。他们本可以事先说明，但我周围似乎尽是些聪明反被聪明误的人，这在 IT 史上也是罕见的。因此，这实际上已是我写给你的第二封信了。

I'm six and a half years old, and since you wrote the address on the envelope, you should know where I live. The weather's kind of nice here all year long, unlike what I've heard about Japan. Endless summer would drive me crazy.
我今年六岁半，既然你在信封上写了地址，你应该知道我住在哪里。这里一年四季天气都挺宜人，与我听闻的日本不同。要是夏天永无止境，我可受不了。

Shinji paused for a moment as he looked out his window at yet another clear sky. Japan's eternal summer, something to do with Second Impact changing the planet's weather, was only generally tolerable during the wet season, but that tended to bring its own problems. He wondered if 'Agatha' would ever come to Japan, or if he would ever go to see them.
真嗣停下脚步，透过窗望向外面又是一个晴朗的天空。日本的永恒夏日，似乎与第二次冲击改变了地球气候有关，只有在雨季才稍显宜人，但雨季也自有其烦恼。他心中暗想，不知“阿加莎”是否会来日本，或者自己是否有机会去见他们。

With one final frown directed at his window, Shinji continued through the letter.
真嗣对着窗户皱了皱眉，然后继续读信。

So you play the cello, huh? Are you any good at it? My dad once bought me an instrument, but I only managed a few lessons before stuff got in the way. Maybe I'll have another go once things have settled down.
原来你拉大提琴呀，水平如何？我爸也曾给我买过乐器，可惜只学了几节课就因事耽搁了。等生活安顿下来，我或许会再试试。

He involuntarily shivered a little when the pen-pal mentioned her father, and the next line didn't help his sharply dropping mood.
笔友提及父亲时，他不禁打了个寒颤，接下来的话更是让他的心情一落千丈。

You say you're living with a teacher being home-schooled. Where's your mum and dad?
你提到你正与一位老师在家自学，你的爸爸妈妈呢？

Anyway, that's enough from me for now. Apparently it takes about a week for mail to get from here to there, so I expect to hear from you again in two weeks at most. Don't keep me waiting!
总之，我先说到这儿。从这儿寄信到那儿大概要花上一周，我估计最多再过两周就能收到你的回信。别让我等太久哦！

Regards, 您好，

Agatha 阿嘉莎

Shinji wrote his reply that same day, mentioning that he had been playing the cello for a few years, but didn't feel like he was very good at it yet. He almost asked Agatha what instrument she had received, but something told him that it wasn't a good idea to bring up the girl's father. He definitely couldn't bring himself to write about his own parents, especially when his mother was-
真嗣当天便回复了，坦言自己拉大提琴已有数年，却自觉技艺尚浅。他差点询问阿加莎得到了何种乐器，但内心有个声音提醒他，最好不要触及女孩父亲的敏感话题。至于自己的父母，尤其是母亲的情况，他更是难以启齿。

He shook his head. Now was not the time to think of such things.
他摇摇头，现在不是想这些的时候。

But despite the taboo subjects, it got much easier to write after the first letter. As they learned more about each other, even with Agatha's 'security thing', their letters slowly grew longer and longer. Shinji's skill at writing in her language grew by leaps and bounds, until eventually his teacher claimed that there was nothing left for him to learn.
虽然话题敏感，但写完首封信后，笔触变得流畅许多。随着双方了解的深入，即便阿加莎有所顾虑，他们的通信也日渐详尽。真嗣在她语言上的书写能力迅速提升，最终连他的老师都认为他已无可再教。

He still wrote the letters. Finishing a class was no reason to suddenly ignore a friend, even if he still didn't know what she looked like. Apparently the security issues Agatha had to deal with extended to photos as well, so she couldn't send one to him. He had made an attempt to send one to Agatha, but in her next letter she had said that it never reached her.
他依旧坚持写信。课程结束并不意味着可以突然冷落朋友，何况他连她的模样都未曾知晓。看来阿加莎面临的安全问题也波及到了照片，她无法寄送照片给他。他曾试图寄照片给阿加莎，但她在回信中表示，照片并未寄达。

For Shinji's tenth birthday, his teacher got something that would make their correspondence much easier: a computer. Thankfully, it allowed for easy typing in both Japanese and German. In their final written letters, Shinji and Agatha exchanged email addresses. Then they moved to the World Wide Web.
真嗣十岁生日那天，他的老师送给他一台电脑，大大方便了他们的通信。这台电脑支持日语和德语的轻松输入。在最后的书信往来中，真嗣和阿加莎互换了电子邮件地址，之后便转入了网络世界。

Both of them were ecstatic about no longer having to wait nearly two weeks to talk to each other. Now, at most, there was a day's delay between emails. Even when Agatha was busy -she wasn't allowed to say what with- she would always reply as soon as she could.
他们俩都为不再需要忍受近两周的等待才能交流而感到无比欣喜。如今，邮件往来最多延迟一天。即便阿加莎事务繁忙——她不便透露具体内容——她也会一有机会就立即回复。

Time passed, and their long-distance friendship grew. The two of them would occasionally send small gifts to each other through the mail, and Shinji occasionally sent a recording of himself playing the cello so that Agatha would stop badgering him about it. Apparently she really liked the pieces despite his own feelings on them.
随着时间的推移，他们的异地友情愈发牢固。两人不时通过邮件互赠小礼物，真嗣偶尔还会寄去自己演奏大提琴的录音，以此来回应阿加莎的频繁催促。尽管真嗣本人对这些曲子并不十分满意，阿加莎却对其情有独钟。

And then the two of them discovered an instant messaging program.
接着，他们俩找到了一个即时通讯软件。

Agatha: I heard something really dumb at school yesterday during lunch.
阿加莎：昨天在学校午餐时，我听到了一些非常愚蠢的事情。

The message alert jingle dragged Shinji out of his maths homework. A distraction was just what he needed, as the numbers on the page were starting to melt together.
消息提醒的铃声把真嗣从数学作业中拽了出来。他正需要这样的打断，因为纸上的数字已经开始混成一团。

CelloBoy: What was it? 大提琴男孩：那是什么东西？

Agatha: Some girl got a stupid boy to give his soul to her.
阿加莎说：有个女孩让一个傻小子把灵魂交给了她。

CelloBoy: ...What? 大提琴男孩：...什么？

Agatha: Exactly what I said. They're boyfriend and girlfriend, and she gave him a fancy looking piece of paper and told him to sign it. Something about how his immortal soul now belongs to her til infinity blah blah blah.
阿加莎：我说的没错，他们是情侣，她递给他一张华丽的纸张，让他签字。大意是他的灵魂从此归她所有，直至永恒，诸如此类。

CelloBoy: Um... does the soul even exist?
大提琴男孩：嗯...灵魂这东西，真的存在吗？

Agatha: Well, there's myths and legends and such about people selling their soul to the devil for things like money and power. But how would you sign away something intangible?
阿加莎：嗯，有很多神话传说提到人们为了金钱和权力等东西，将灵魂卖给魔鬼。但这种无形之物，该如何签约呢？

CelloBoy: It almost sounds like the girlfriend wanted to marry him, only... not?
大提琴男孩：听起来女友似乎有意与他结婚，但又似乎并非如此？

Agatha: Yeah, binding them together for eternity. Blech. So sappy. He didn't even read the contract before signing it, like a dumbass. She could have put anything in there. For all we know he's now permanently enslaved to her.
阿加莎：对啊，让他们永远绑定在一起，真是腻歪。他连合同都没看就签字了，真是够傻的。她完全可以在合同里写任何东西。说不定他现在已经被永久奴役于她了。

CelloBoy: So do you believe in the soul?
大提琴男孩：那么，你相信有灵魂吗？

There was an uncomfortably long wait before Agatha finally replied.
阿加莎迟迟未回，让人等得颇为焦躁。

Agatha: Hell no. Just look at this contract I found on the internet. I think it's the same as what I saw the boy sign.
阿加莎：绝对不行。瞧瞧我在网上找到的这个合同，我觉得它和那男孩签的合同一模一样。

Shinji clicked the link. The image slowly loaded, and his eyebrows raised at how fancy the contract looked. Ornate line-work bordered a full page of text, with lines such as 'In exchange for _, I hereby offer my immortal soul to _ (hereafter referred to as THE RECIPIENT)' and 'This pact is legally binding, even if physically destroyed.'
真嗣点击链接后，图片逐渐显现，他看到合同装饰得异常精美，不由得挑起了眉毛。页面四周是精致的线条图案，文字中包含着“作为交换，我在此向_（以下简称接收方）献上我的不朽灵魂”以及“此契约具有法律约束力，即使实体被毁也不影响其效力。”等条款。

CelloBoy: This thing is weird.
大提琴男孩说：这玩意儿真怪异。

Agatha: I know. Somebody actually sat down and created this. See that bit about the Infernal Administration?
阿加莎：我明白。确实有人专门坐下来制作了这个。你注意到里面提到的地狱行政部分了吗？

With a quick look back at the image, Shinji found the part in question.
真嗣迅速回头瞥了一眼图像，随即发现了问题的所在。

CelloBoy: 'If at any time the details of this pact are called into argument, or an attempt to alter the pact is made, an agent of the Infernal Administration must be at hand to oversee the negotiations.'
大提琴男孩：“一旦此契约的条款受到质疑或有人企图修改，地狱行政机构须立即派遣一名代理人到场，确保谈判公正进行。”

CelloBoy: Um... wow. Whoever made this sure was thorough.
大提琴男孩：嗯...真是令人惊叹。制作这个的人真是细致入微。

Agatha: Yeah. Lot of time on their hands or something.
阿加莎：没错。他们大概挺闲的。

CelloBoy: Would such a thing even be legal? You know, if the soul did exist. This is just something you found on the internet.
大提琴男孩：如果灵魂真的存在，这种事会合法吗？这只是你从网上找到的。

Agatha: If it existed then of course it would be legal. Probably. But it doesn't, so it doesn't matter. Hell, why not print it out, sign it and send it to me in exchange for some chocolate? It's about all that contract's really worth.
阿加莎：如果这东西真的存在，那它或许合法。大概吧。不过既然它不存在，讨论这个也没意义。不如干脆打印出来，签个名，用巧克力跟我交换寄给我得了。这份合同的价值也就这样了。

CelloBoy: Heh. Maybe I'll do that anyway. I wouldn't mind some chocolate.
大提琴男孩：嘿嘿，或许我还是会这么做。吃点巧克力也不错。

Shinji pressed CTRL-P on his keyboard, sending the image to his printer. He raised an eyebrow when he returned to the messaging client and saw the next message.
真嗣按下键盘的 CTRL-P 键，将图像打印出来。回到消息客户端，看到下一条消息时，他不禁挑了挑眉。

Agatha: Wait, really?! You're actually gonna sign it?!
阿加莎：等等，真的假的？！你真打算签字了？！

CelloBoy: Why not? You said yourself that it's all bogus.
大提琴男孩：何不如此？你不是也说过这一切都是无稽之谈吗？

Agatha: ...Well... Fine. But just in case it isn't bogus, I'm gonna send you some damn fine chocolate. Don't want you to feel ripped off in case science discovers the soul or whatever.
阿加莎：……行吧……好吧。不过，为了以防万一，我会寄些上等巧克力给你。万一科学真发现了灵魂之类的，也不希望你觉得吃亏。

CelloBoy: Thanks. I'm looking forward to it. And if by some miracle that does happen, I won't hold it against you. Oh, what should I put on the contract for what I'm getting?
大提琴男孩：感谢你。我对此充满期待。万一真有奇迹发生，我也不会因此责怪你。对了，合同里我该写明我获得的是什么内容呢？

Agatha: Do whatever you like. Bogus, remember? Anyway, I better get going. Nearly 8am here, gotta get ready for school.
阿加莎：随你做什么都行，反正是假的，记得吧？我得赶紧走了，快 8 点了，得去准备上学了。

CelloBoy: Yeah, I should get back to my maths homework. Talk to you again soon.
大提琴男孩：嗯，我得回去继续做数学作业了。回头再聊。

Agatha: Later. 阿加莎：待会儿见。

Agatha has signed off. 阿加莎已经下班了。

As Shinji posted the letter an hour later, he wondered if the pact required that both parties actually be physically present for the signing. Then he shrugged as he remembered that it didn't matter anyway, before walking back home, eagerly anticipating, as the contract clearly stated, 'some damn fine chocolate'.
真嗣寄出信件后一小时，心中琢磨这份契约是否要求双方必须亲自到场签字。转念一想，这其实并不重要，他便耸耸肩，满怀期待地走回家，因为合同中明确提到了“一些绝妙的巧克力”。

What am I doing? thought Shinji as he waited in the fluid-filled metal tube. I move halfway across the country because my father sent a letter with one word, arrive right as... something attacks, end up trying to fight that thing in a giant robot I've never seen before, resulting in me falling flat on my face and getting my rear handed to me. Then I pass out from getting stabbed in the head, and wake up in a hospital to find out that not only did I not actually get stabbed, I'd somehow killed the... Angel or whatever.
我在干什么呢？真嗣在充满液体的金属管中等待时，心中疑惑。只因父亲寄来一封仅含“到达”二字的信，我便横跨半个国家来到此地，恰逢不明物体袭击，仓促间驾驶从未见过的巨型机器人应战，却摔得狼狈不堪，惨遭击败。随后因头部被刺而昏迷，醒来却身处医院，得知自己并未受伤，反而莫名其妙地击败了那个所谓的“天使”。

He exhaled slowly. And now I've asked to start training just because I remembered what my friend told me a while ago. 'Just because you don't want to do something you have to, doesn't mean you should put it off until the last minute. If you get it over with as soon as possible, you'll feel much better afterwards.' Seemed like she was speaking from experience too.
他缓缓地呼出一口气。此刻我请求开始训练，是因为我想起了朋友之前的一番话：“即便你不想做非做不可的事，也不该拖到最后一刻。尽早解决，之后你会感到轻松许多。”她的话似乎也源自亲身经历。

Shinji let a single tiny humourless chuckle escape his mouth, unnoticed by the people observing him. I wonder if Agatha would be proud of me for this. He scrunched his eyes closed and sighed. I just don't want to screw up again. Everybody already saw me fall over and damage their expensive robot. I really don't want to disappoint Misato again either, especially after she's offered her own home to some kid she's just met.
真嗣不禁从口中逸出一丝微弱且缺乏幽默感的笑声，未被旁观者察觉。我在想，阿加莎是否会为我的表现感到骄傲。他紧闭双眼，深深叹了口气。我真的不想再犯错了。大家已经目睹我摔倒并损坏了那台昂贵的机器人。我也不愿再次让美里失望，尤其是在她慷慨地将自己的家提供给一个初识的孩子之后。

He opened his eyes again. It seemed as if the people in charge were almost ready.
他再次睁开双眼，仿佛负责人已经准备就绪。

Alright... here we go, Shinji.
好了...我们开始吧，真嗣。

"Alright," said the blonde woman, tiredness evident in her voice. "Let's begin."
好吧，"金发女子疲惫地说，"我们开始吧。

As the bridge crew before her began tapping at their consoles and calling out progress reports, a purple-haired woman stepped up next to her.
她面前的桥员们开始敲击控制台，报告进展，此时一位紫发女子走到了她身旁。

"When was the last time you slept, Ritsuko?" the woman asked. "Were you up all night getting ready for this?"
律子，你上次睡觉是什么时候？是不是为了准备这个通宵没睡？

"Of course I was, Misato," Ritsuko grumpily replied. "I wasn't expecting the Third Child to want to start training so soon after being released from the hospital. His profile didn't give any hint that he'd want to be so... pro-active."
当然，我是的，葛城。" 律子有些不悦地回应，"真没想到第三适格者刚出院就急着要开始训练。他的档案里可没提到他会这么积极。

Misato shrugged. "Poor kid almost got his ass kicked because we sent him out with no training. Maybe he wants to be as ready as possible for next time."
美里耸了耸肩。"这孩子真可怜，差点因为我们的疏忽，没经过训练就被派出去而挨打。他可能是想尽可能为下次做好充分准备。"

"Perhaps." Ritsuko looked up at the giant holographic screen which showed a brown-haired boy sitting in a metal tube. "How do you feel, Shinji? No rush today, so take the time to get comfortable. You'll be in there for a few hours."
可能吧。" 律子抬头看着那巨大的全息屏幕，画面中是一个坐在金属圆筒里的棕发少年。"真嗣，你现在感觉如何？今天不赶时间，慢慢调整，让自己舒服点。你会在那里面待上几个小时。

"I'm alright, Doctor Akagi," Shinji replied.
"我很好，秋吉医生，" 真嗣回答说。

"Good." At a hand signal from one of the bridge crew, Ritsuko called out, "Prepare for the first simulation. Since we didn't have time to do it properly before, we're starting right from the beginning: basic movement."
好的。" 接到桥上一名工作人员的信号后，律子随即宣布："准备开始第一次模拟。由于之前时间紧迫，未能按常规步骤操作，这次我们从头开始，先练习基本移动。

Two new screens appeared in the air in front of the bridge, the first showing the view of the simulated city from the massive bipedal machine the boy was piloting, and the second showing a map of the area. A red line began to grow on the map, heading into the city and weaving about the buildings before exiting on the opposite side.
桥前方的空中浮现出两个新屏幕，第一个映出男孩操控的巨型双足机器人视角下的模拟城市景观，第二个则呈现该区域的地图。地图上，一条红线开始蔓延，穿梭于城市建筑之间，最终从另一端穿出。

"Since this is just a simulation, don't stress about crashing into anything," said Ritsuko, before quickly adding, "But that doesn't mean you can just smash through it. You will be doing this until you get it perfect."
既然这只是模拟，就不必担心撞到东西，" 里津子提醒道，紧接着又强调，"不过，这并非意味着你可以肆意冲撞。你需要不断练习，直至达到完美。

"Y-yes ma'am." 好的，女士。

It took over an hour before Shinji managed to cleanly walk through the city, and another half hour before he could do it at a run. After that came basic combat training, first with the giant-robot-sized knife located in Unit-01's left pauldron, and then with a giant-robot-sized pistol, before moving onto what the blonde scientist called a Pallet Rifle.
真嗣花了超过一小时才学会在城市中流畅行走，又过了半小时才能奔跑自如。随后进行基础战斗训练，先是操作初号机左肩甲上的巨型刀具，接着换成巨型手枪，最后才接触到那位金发科学家所称的调色板步枪。

Target the centre.. pull the switch...
对准中心...拉下开关...

Bullets the size of cars slammed into his targets, while shell casings bigger than buses fell to the ground at Unit-01's feet.
汽车般大小的子弹猛击目标，巨大的弹壳，比公交车还要大，在初号机脚下轰然坠落。

"You're doing great!" came the enthusiastic exclamation from his new guardian and roommate after a couple hours of shooting at stationary targets, then moving targets, then finally targets that returned fire and attempted to attack him. "Still a ways to go, but we're not expecting to make a sharpshooter out of you in a day."
你干得真不错！"经过数小时对静止目标、移动目标，乃至会反击并企图攻击他的目标进行射击训练后，他的新监护人和室友热情地鼓励道。"虽然还有不少进步，但我们并不指望你一天之内就变成神枪手。

"A week then?" he lamely joked.
"那说是一周？"他尴尬地开了个玩笑。

Misato chuckled. "Hey, you'll be starting school in a couple days, remember. Call it a fortnight."
美里轻笑一声：“嘿，别忘了，你再过几天就要开学了。就当是两周时间吧。”

The scientist lady cut in. "Well now that you know the basics of CQC and how not to shoot yourself in the foot, it's time we teach you about the final weapon in the Eva's arsenal: the AT-Field."
女科学家打断道：“好了，既然你们掌握了近身格斗的基本要领，也学会了避免误伤自己，接下来该教你们 Eva 的终极武器——AT 力场了。”

That was when things started to go wrong.
那时情况开始变糟。

XXX

"No AT-Field detected." 未检测到绝对领域。

"I think we should take a break now," suggested Misato. "We've been at this one thing for an hour with absolutely no progress."
我觉得咱们现在该歇会儿了，" 三乡建议说。"我们在这件事上已经忙活了一个小时，却一点进展都没有。

Ritsuko sighed, the thumb and forefinger of one hand slowly stroking her forehead. "Fine," she relented, "Ten minute break to go over the systems again, then we'll have one more go."
律子叹了口气，用一只手的拇指和食指轻轻揉着额头。“行吧，”她妥协道，“休息十分钟，把系统再检查一遍，然后我们再试一次。”

No anomalies detected, no errors in the code, no mechanical malfunctions. And yet for some reason the Third Child seemed incapable of generating an AT-Field. It certainly wasn't laziness or stupidity on the boy's part, as it was clear he was trying his best. A glance at the screen clearly showed the despondence Shinji was feeling at being incapable of performing an apparently simple task.
未发现异常，代码无误，机械运作正常。但不知为何，第三适格者就是无法生成 AT 力场。这绝非男孩懒惰或愚笨，他显然已竭尽全力。屏幕上真嗣那因无法完成一项看似简单的任务而流露出的沮丧，一览无余。

"Ideas, anybody?" Ritsuko asked the room after a few silent minutes. "Anything that might cause this? Anything else we can try?"
大家有什么想法吗？" 经过几分钟的沉默，Ritsuko 向房间里的人询问。"有没有什么可能导致这种情况？我们还能做些什么尝试？

"Um..." 呃...

The blonde scientist turned to the mousy female bridge officer. "Let's hear it, Lieutenant Ibuki."
金发科学家转头看向那位相貌平平的女桥官，说道：“伊吹中尉，请说吧。”

Maya Ibuki flinched a little as the gaze of everybody in the room fell on her, but soon recovered. "Perhaps we could get another pilot in? Maybe Pilot Ayanami could teach him, since... well... she's a pilot too?"
真希波·玛丽·伊兰崔亚斯在众人目光聚焦下略显紧张，但随即镇定下来。“要不我们再找一位飞行员？绫波或许能指导他，毕竟……她也是飞行员嘛。”

"A good idea, but the First Child is still in a serious condition." Ritsuko glanced down at her tablet and scanned through a few files. "At least a week until she'll be ready for release."
想法不错，但首名儿童的状况依旧严重。" 理子低头查看平板上的文件，快速浏览了几份资料。"至少还需一周她才能出院。

"And another damn Angel could attack tomorrow for all we know," Misato grumbled.
"谁知道呢，说不定明天又会有该死的天使来袭击我们，" 碇真嗣不满地嘟囔着。

"Precisely." 正是如此。

"How about the Second Child then?" asked Shigeru Aoba, the long-haired bridge officer "She's not injured, but she is in Germany."
那第二个孩子情况如何？"长发桥牌官青叶茂询问道，"她并未受伤，只是人在德国。

Ritsuko nodded. "Good idea. We can set up a conference call between the pilots." A quick look at her watch and some swift mental arithmetic gave her the current time in Germany. "It's about ten-thirty in the morning there now, so she'll likely be on-site already. Let's get NERV-Berlin on the phone and tell them to get her ready."
律子点头赞同。"好主意，我们安排一次飞行员间的电话会议吧。"她瞥了眼手表，迅速算出德国此刻大约是上午十点半。"她应该已经在现场了。我们联系一下 NERV 柏林，让他们通知她做好准备。"

Fifteen minutes later a new screen was added to the holographic display. A young red-headed girl with blue eyes, clad in a red plugsuit, glared at the camera with arms folded.
十五分钟后，全息显示屏上新添了一个画面。画面中，一位红发蓝眼的少女，身着红色紧身战斗服，双臂抱胸，目光如炬地直视着镜头。

"Alright, where's this damn rookie who doesn't know how to use his AT-Field?" she demanded. With a few button presses, Maya connected their comm systems. Immediately, her head drew back. "Him? Hmph, not much to look at, is he?"
行了，那个连 AT 力场都不会用的笨蛋新手在哪儿？"她不耐烦地问。玛雅迅速操作了几下，接通了通讯。她随即往后一缩，轻蔑地说："就他？哼，看起来也没什么出奇的。

"What's that supposed to mean?" Shinji's head shot up from where it had been nestled against his chest ever since the last failed attempt. Any further words died in his throat as he locked eyes with the newcomer.
"你这话是什么意思？" 自从上次尝试失败后，真嗣一直低头不语，此刻却猛然抬头。与新来者目光相遇的瞬间，他原本要说的话卡在了喉咙里。

"Ah good, might be something there after all," Asuka murmured almost to herself in German as a smirk began to form on her face.
"啊，太好了，看来那里或许真有料，" 明日香用德语低声自语，嘴角勾起一抹微笑。

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "Um, I can understand you, you know," he replied, also in German.
真嗣挑眉道：“嗯，我听得懂你说的，你知道的。”他同样用德语回应。

The Second Child's eyebrows almost flew off her face as they shot up. "Holy shit, you can actually speak German?"
第二个孩子的眉毛差点儿飞离脸庞，惊讶地扬起。"天哪，你真会讲德语啊？"

"Yes, I learned it when I was a lot younger-"
是的，我年纪还小的时候就已经学过了。

"As interesting as I'm sure your conversation is," Ritsuko interrupted in typical adult annoyance which had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she couldn't understand them, "can we please get back to business?"
虽然我确信你们的谈话很有趣，" 律子带着典型的成人式不耐烦打断道，这完全与她听不懂他们无关，"我们能回到正事上吗？

"Alright," Asuka replied with a sigh as she moved back to Japanese. "So. Third Child. You got a name? Preferably something easier to say than 'Third Child'?"
好吧，" 明日香叹了口气，改用日语问道，"那么，第三适格者，你有名字吗？最好是比'第三适格者'更顺口的名字。

"Ah, my name is Shinji Ikari."
啊，我叫碇真嗣。

"Shin-" The redhead paused, frowning for a moment as she tilted her head to the side and her gaze turned introspective, before shaking her head. "Shinji Ikari. I take it you're the Commander's son, then?"
Shin-" 红发女子顿了顿，眉头微蹙，侧头沉思片刻，接着摇了摇头。"碇真嗣，这么说来，你是司令的儿子了？

"Y-yeah." 是的。

Asuka scoffed and rolled her eyes. "Great, nepotism." Before Shinji could respond, she barrelled on. "And you're having trouble projecting an AT-Field." Her eyes shifted, moving from the camera that showed Shinji's face to the bridge. "Nothing wrong on your end I take it?"
明日香不屑地翻了个白眼，嘲讽道：“真行，靠关系上位。”没等真嗣开口，她又接着说：“你连 AT 力场都展开不了。”她的视线从真嗣面部的摄像头转向了指挥桥，问道：“你那边应该没问题吧？”

Misato nodded. "We've gone over everything with a fine-toothed comb. Twice. We're hoping that since you're a pilot you'd be able to better explain, and demonstrate, how to do it."
碇真嗣点头表示同意。“我们已经对所有事项进行了细致的梳理，反复两次。我们期待作为驾驶员的你，能更清晰地解释并展示操作方法。”

"Alright then." Asuka interlaced her fingers and stretched her hands out in front of her. "Pay attention, Third Child! Watch how a real pilot does this!"
那好，听着。" 明日香十指交扣，向前伸展双臂。"看仔细了，第三适格者！学学真正驾驶员的操作！

Nobody heard the softly muttered, "Why did she bother asking my name?" coming from Unit-01.
无人察觉初号机轻声嘀咕：“她何苦问我的名字呢？”

A new screen appeared where once had been a map of the simulation area, now showing a view of Asuka's Evangelion; the red and orange Unit-02. For a moment the view shimmered, as if heat waves were distorting the image before abruptly vanishing once more.
原本显示模拟区域地图的位置，突然出现了一个新屏幕，上面展示着明日香的福音战士——红橙色的二号机。画面短暂地闪烁，似乎被热浪扭曲，随即又迅速恢复清晰。

"Unit-02 has deployed its AT-Field," Makoto Hyuga reported.
"二号机已展开其 AT 力场，" 碇真嗣报告道。

"Done! So simple even you could do it." Asuka loftily stated.
"搞定啦！简单到你都能轻松完成。" 飞鸟带着一丝傲气说道。

"But... how?" Shinji confusedly asked. "I didn't really see you do anything."
可是...怎么回事？" 真嗣不解地问，"我确实没看到你有什么动作。

"Ugh. I said to pay attention, stupid!"
哎呀，我明明提醒过你要注意的，真是的！

"To what?! All you did was frown, then start insulting me!"
你说什么？！你一开始只是皱眉，接着就开始辱骂我！

German curses started to flow from the mouth of the Second Child. "Look. All you have to do is imagine a barrier in front of you..."
第二个孩子的口中开始吐露出德语的咒骂。“听着，你只需想象面前有一堵墙……”

Ritsuko mentally tuned out the squabbling brats. Pilot Soryu was now going over ground they had already trodden with Shinji, so all she could do was hope that something clicked for the Third Child so they could continue his training.
律子在心里对那些争吵的小鬼充耳不闻。飞行员惣流现在正重复与真嗣已经探讨过的内容，她只能寄希望于第三适格者能有所领悟，以便继续推进他的训练。

Preferably before the next Angel arrived.
最好赶在下一个天使到来之前。

She sighed heavily and wished there was a free chair for her to collapse into. She had been hoping to have a little free time to unwind after the Third Angel's attack, but Shinji had insisted on starting training. "This isn't working," she muttered as she leaned on the console next to Maya. "There's no logical reason why the Third Child can't project an AT-Field. He synchronises just fine with Unit-01. Should we try him in Unit-00?"
她深深叹了口气，渴望能找到一张空椅子坐下。原本期待在第三次使徒攻击后能稍作休息，但真嗣却坚持要开始训练。“这样不行，”她倚在玛雅旁边的控制台上低声抱怨。“从逻辑上讲，没有理由第三适格者不能展开 AT 力场。他与初号机同步得很好。我们是不是该让他试试零号机？”

"I'm afraid I don't know as much about the Evas as you, ma'am, so I can't offer an explanation," Maya admitted. "The only thing I can think to ask is: from your perspective, how exactly does the pilot project an AT-Field?"
我承认，我对 Evas 的了解不及您，女士，因此无法给出解释。我唯一能想到的问题是：在您看来，驾驶员是如何具体投射 AT 力场的呢？

"Simple," replied Ritsuko. "Well, sort of. As the pilot focuses on generating the barrier, their soul resonates with the Eva's core, which then amplifies it and actually projects the AT-Field. That's part of the reason why-"
里津子回答说：'其实很简单，或者说，有点儿复杂。当驾驶员集中精力生成屏障时，他们的灵魂与 EVA 核心产生共振，进而核心将这种共振放大，并实际投射出 AT 力场。这正是部分原因所在，'

"Um... excuse me?" 呃... 打扰一下？

Ritsuko looked up and glared at the interruption. "What is it, Pilot Ikari?"
律子抬头瞪着打断她的人，不悦地问：“怎么了，碇飞行员？”

Shinji fidgeted in his seat while Asuka glared irritatedly at him. Clearly their training was still not producing any results.
真嗣在座位上不安地扭动，明日香则恼怒地盯着他。显然，他们的训练依旧未见成效。

"What you just said about the pilot's soul..." the boy slowly said. "Could you... please repeat that?"
你刚才提到飞行员灵魂的那番话……" 男孩缓缓开口，"能否请你再重复一遍？

"What?" Ritsuko blinked owlishly for a moment. "You mean what I said about how the pilot's soul resonates with the core?"
什么？" 律子眨巴着眼睛，一时显得有些懵。"你是指我说的驾驶员灵魂与核心产生共鸣的事吗？

"Yeah. That." Now Shinji was looking edgy, nervously shifting around in his seat.
"对，就是那个。" 此刻，真嗣显得局促不安，在座位上不停地挪动着。

"Stop wasting time, Third," Asuka angrily cut in. "We're not going anywhere until you can get your damn AT-Field up."
别再浪费时间了，第三，" 明日香怒气冲冲地插话，"你的 AT 力场不启动，我们就不走。

"B-but I think this is really i-important!" Shinji stammered. "The thing is, it's going to sound s-stupid!"
可是，我觉得这事儿非常关键！" 碇真嗣有些口吃地说，"只是，说出来可能会显得很傻！

"Of course it will. Stupid boy, stupid ideas."
肯定会这样。这孩子真傻，净想些蠢事。

"Knock it off, Asuka," Misato sharply rebuked. "We've tried literally everything. I want to hear what he's got to say. Maybe it's the cause for all this."
明日香，别闹了，" 美里严厉地说，"我们真的已经尝试了所有可能。我想听听他的说法，说不定这就是问题的根源。

Asuka slouched back into her pilot chair and threw up her arms. "Fine. Waste everybody's time some more. See if I care."
明日香懒洋洋地靠回驾驶座，双臂一摊。"行吧，继续浪费大家的时间好了，看我管不管。"

"I-I mean it though! It's going to sound stupid and you're going to laugh at me!" Shinji sounded like he was almost about to start crying.
"我-我是说真的！这话听着可能很傻，你会笑话我的！" 真嗣的声音带着哭腔。

"Everybody settle down!" Misato's authoritative voice cut through the air and into the two entry plugs, and the bridge fell completely silent. She stared around the room, focusing on each individual for a second before continuing on to the next. Finally, she spoke in a lower tone of voice. "Okay. Shinji, this is a serious problem for all of us. We promise not to laugh. Go ahead and say what's on your mind."
大家请安静！" 葛城美里的声音充满权威，穿透空气，传入两个插入栓，指挥室立刻陷入寂静。她环顾四周，目光在每个人身上停留一秒，然后转向下一个人。最后，她放低声音说："好了，真嗣，这个问题对我们都很严重。我们保证不会嘲笑你。请说出你的想法。

Out of the corner of her eye, Ritsuko clearly saw Asuka roll her eyes, but said nothing. It was the Ikari brat's time to speak.
从眼角余光中，Ritsuko 清晰地捕捉到 Asuka 翻了个白眼，却未发一言。轮到碇家那小子说话了。

"R-right. Um... So..." In his entry plug, Shinji blushed and stammered and looked anywhere but at the camera. "A-a few years ago, I-I..." He buried his face in his gloved hands. "Oh gods..." A single look from Misato kept the bridge silent, and Shinji soon found his voice again. "A few years ago I...
右...嗯...所以..." 在插入栓中，真嗣脸颊泛红，说话结巴，眼神四处躲避镜头。"几...几年前，我..." 他用手套遮住脸，声音带着羞涩。"哦，天啊..." 美里的一瞥让指挥室瞬间静默，真嗣不久便重新开口："几年前，我...

"I sold my soul for some chocolate."
我为了几块巧克力，竟出卖了自己的灵魂。

A pin falling on the floor would have sounded like an explosion in the deathly quiet room. But then...
一根针若掉在地板上，在这死一般的寂静中，其声响无异于爆炸。然而...

"Snrk." 噗嗤。

Misato slapped a hand over the offending mouth: her own. But she couldn't stop the small chuckles escaping past her fingers. Next to her, Ritsuko was looking down at the floor and shaking her head in bemusement, a smile evident on her lips. Even the bridge officers were unable to remain stoic.
真嗣用手捂住了自己那张惹事的嘴，但仍止不住从指缝间溜出的轻笑声。在她身旁，美里低头看着地板，无奈地摇着头，嘴角却挂着明显的笑意。就连舰桥上的军官们也无法保持严肃。

"Really, Shinji? Some chocolate?" Misato remarked, trying desperately not to erupt into outright laughter. "I mean, I know I've said in the past that I'd sell my own soul for some beer, but at least I stipulated that it would need to be a slab or better."
真的吗，真嗣？就一点巧克力？" 美里说道，努力克制自己不要笑出声来。"我确实说过为了啤酒我愿意出卖灵魂，但至少我要求的是一大块或更高级的。

"You said you wouldn't laugh!" Shinji's plaintive whine echoed throughout the bridge.
"你不是说不会笑吗！" 真嗣那充满哀怨的抱怨声在桥上回响。

Somehow, that made it worse. Now Ritsuko and the bridge officers were openly grinning, but the upward tilt to Maya's mouth seemed strained as the woman glanced around the room.
不知何故，这反而让局面更加尴尬。此刻，律子和舰桥上的军官们都在明目张胆地笑，而玛雅的嘴角虽微微上扬，却显得颇为勉强，她环视了一圈房间。

"I thought about selling my soul for more musical talent," Shigeru admitted. "Couldn't find any buyers though."
我一度想过用灵魂换取更多音乐才华，" 志贺坦言，"可惜没找到愿意交易的人。

Now only one person wasn't laughing.
此刻唯独一人未笑。

And she was sitting in her entry plug, eyes so wide open they were in danger of falling out of her head, staring at the camera showing Shinji's defeated expression. Finally, after the blonde doctor made some remark about having already sold her soul, she shuffled forward on her chair and began stabbing at the holographic keyboard next to it. With a glance at her fellow pilot, who was now beginning to curl up into a ball of embarrassment, she took a deep breath.
她坐在插入栓里，眼睛睁得大大的，几乎要掉出来似的，紧盯着屏幕上真嗣那挫败的表情。金发医生提到已经出卖了灵魂后，她挪动椅子，开始用力敲打旁边的全息键盘。看了一眼正尴尬地蜷缩起来的另一位驾驶员，她深深吸了一口气。

"ENOUGH!" 够了！

The sheer volume of the shout nearly sent Misato and Ritsuko stumbling to the ground. Later, NERV personnel would claim they had heard the Second Child all the way from the cafeteria.
那声震耳欲聋的呼喊几乎让美里和律子站立不稳。事后，NERV 的员工们纷纷表示，他们在食堂都听到了第二适格者的声音。

"W-what was that?" Ritsuko shakily asked.
"那是什么？" 立子颤抖着问道。

"Pilot Soryu patched herself into Unit-01's external speakers," Maya replied after a moment.
"飞行员 Soryu 接入 Unit-01 的外部扬声器后，"Maya 稍作停顿后回应道。

"You're goddamn right I did! Because I'm a fucking genius, but you people are apparently utter dumbasses!"
你说得一点没错，我就是这么做的！因为我确实是个天才，而你们显然都是些十足的傻瓜！

Misato raised a hand to tuck a lock of loose hair back behind her ear. "We're sorry, Asuka, it's just-"
真嗣伸手将一缕松散的头发别到耳后，说：“抱歉，明日香，只是……”

"What is going on here?"
这里怎么了？

Everybody on the bridge turned towards the raised platform where the Supreme Commander of NERV would sit. Commander Ikari himself was not present, but the gray-haired man currently staring down at them was proving he was just as capable of inciting fear in his subordinates. An aura of extreme disapproval radiated off of him.
桥上众人纷纷望向升起的平台，那里是 NERV 最高指挥官的座位。伊卡里指挥官虽未现身，但眼前这位灰发男子正以他的威严让下属心生畏惧。他身上散发着一股强烈的不满气息。

"Who the hell are you, old man?" Asuka demanded.
"你到底是谁，老先生？" 明日香质问道。

The newcomer stared through the screen as if he were about to strike the arrogant girl dead. "I am Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. Would you like to tell me why I was capable of hearing your voice from the Commander's office, Pilot Soryu?"
新来者透过屏幕凝视，仿佛就要对那傲慢的女孩出手。“我是副指挥官 Fuyutsuki。你能告诉我，为何我能在指挥官办公室听到你的声音吗，飞行员 Soryu？”

"Sub... shit," Asuka muttered as an embarrassed blush grew on her face. "Um... sorry sir, I've never seen you in person before." She shook her head and rallied. "I want to level a complaint against these bridge officers for harassing my fellow pilot, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki."
Sub... 糟糕，" 明日香喃喃自语，脸上不由得泛起羞涩的红晕。"呃... 抱歉，长官，我之前没见过您本人。" 她摇了摇头，鼓起勇气。"我要投诉这些舰桥军官，他们对我同事飞行员，副指挥官冬月进行了骚扰。

"These officers? Harassment?" An eyebrow raised on the sub-commander's face. "Rather a serious accusation. Tell me what happened."
这些军官？骚扰？"副指挥官的眉头微微一挑，"这指控可不轻。说说看，到底怎么回事？

The adult officers remained abashedly silent as a thirteen year old girl spoke of them laughing at a fourteen year old boy who was just trying to offer an explanation for his inability to do something they had asked of him.
成年官员们尴尬地保持沉默，一名十三岁女孩讲述他们如何嘲笑一个十四岁男孩，只因他试图解释自己为何做不到他们所要求的事。

"I see." Fuyutsuki rubbed his chin in thought. "By the way, I'm not condoning this sort of behaviour, but I've read your profile. Why are you sticking up so adamantly for a boy you don't know, to the point that you essentially hacked into our system just to defend him?"
我明白了。" 冬月摸着下巴，陷入沉思。"顺便提一下，我并非赞同这种做法，但我看过你的档案。你为何要为一个素不相识的男孩如此坚决地辩护，甚至不惜侵入我们的系统来为他撑腰？

Asuka looked away, tapping her forefingers together nervously. "...Because I do know him. We've known each other for years."
明日香别开视线，手指不安地相互轻敲。“……因为我确实认识他。我们相识已久。”

Down on the bridge, Misato slapped a hand to her head as she came to a realisation. In Unit-01's entry plug, Shinji leaned forward in his chair, shock painted all over his face.
桥上，美里猛地一拍额头，恍然大悟。而在初号机的驾驶舱内，真嗣身体前倾，脸上写满了震惊。

"Hello Shinji," Asuka quietly said, staring into his eyes through the camera. "Just call me Agatha."
你好，真嗣，" 明日香轻声说道，透过镜头直视他的双眼。"叫我阿加莎就好。

### Chapter 02 It's a Surprise!

"This is... problematic."
这真是...麻烦了。

Ritsuko stood with her hands clasped behind her back. The chilling look in the eyes of Commander Gendo Ikari never failed to send a shiver down her spine. "There appears to be nothing we can do to fix this. The Third Child is simply incapable of generating an AT-Field, despite his synchronisation with Unit-01. We even took the time to try him in Unit-00 with no success."
律子双手背在身后站立着。源堂司令那冰冷的目光总是让她不寒而栗。"看来我们对此无能为力。尽管与零号机同步，第三适格者就是无法产生 AT 力场。我们甚至尝试让他驾驶零零号机，结果依旧失败。"

"So we have a problem," Fuyutsuki remarked from his standing position just behind and to the right of the Commander. "We could still deploy Pilot Ikari in Unit-01, but he would be in danger the moment an Angel raises an AT-Field. If he can't raise one to counter it, he would be both defenseless and unable to hurt the enemy. We can't rely on the Eva going berserk every fight in order to breach an Angel's AT-Field."
所以我们遇到了难题，"冬月副司令站在司令右后方，评论道，"我们仍可以让碇真嗣驾驶初号机出击，但一旦使徒展开 AT 力场，他就会陷入危险。如果他无法生成反制力场，那么他将既无防御能力，也无法伤害敌人。我们不能指望每次战斗都依赖初号机暴走来突破使徒的 AT 力场。

"Unacceptable," Ikari swiftly replied. "While the safety of Unit-01 is paramount, the AT-Field would have provided sufficient protection to make any deployment an acceptable risk."
这是不可接受的，"源堂迅速回应，"虽然初号机的安全至关重要，但 AT 力场本应提供足够的保护，使得任何出击都成为可接受的风险。

"We could just wash him out and get the Marduk Institute to 'discover' another pilot," Ritsuko bluntly suggested. "Put Ayanami in Unit-01 and the new pilot in Unit-00, since that Eva should have the least problems with a different pilot."
我们大可把他淘汰掉，让马杜克机关再‘发掘’一个驾驶员，" 律子直截了当地提议道，"让绫波驾驶零号机，新驾驶员则驾驶初号机，毕竟那台 EVA 应该对不同驾驶员的适应性最好。

"That is a possibility," Fuyutsuki conceded, "but we need a pilot now. The Fourth Angel could attack in a month, or in an hour. With the First Child's injuries making her temporarily unsuitable, we should try to bring the Second Child to Tokyo-3."
这确实是个办法，" 冬月承认道，"但我们现在就需要一个驾驶员。第四使徒可能一个月后袭击，也可能就在一小时后。既然第一适格者因伤暂时无法胜任，我们应该设法将第二适格者带到第三新东京市来。

"But Unit-02 isn't ready for transport yet," argued Ritsuko. "It's still being prepped to travel along the upgraded Trans-Siberian Railway, and moving it by air will cost far too much and potentially not get here in time anyway."
但二号机还没准备好运输，" 律子反驳道，"它还在为通过升级后的西伯利亚铁路旅行做准备，而空运不仅成本高昂，还可能无法及时到达。

Ikari gave a slight tilt of his head. "Indeed. The old men would balk at spending so much money this early in the scenario, especially after already paying for Unit-02's current transport arrangements. But I do not believe that is what you had in mind, Fuyutsuki?"
碇稍微侧了侧头，"确实如此。那些老家伙们会因为这么早就在计划中投入如此巨资而犹豫，尤其是在已经为二号机的当前运输安排支付费用之后。但我想，这并非你所考虑的，对吧，冬月？"

"No, it wasn't. I was going to suggest that you speak with the Committee about bringing Pilot Soryu to Tokyo-3 by plane, to see if she can synchronise with Unit-01."
不，并非如此。我是想建议你与委员会讨论一下，看是否能通过飞机将驾驶员惣流带到第三新东京市，试试她能否与初号机同步。

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. "You really think Unit-01 will accept her?"
律子挑了挑眉。"你真的认为初号机会接受她吗？"

Fuyutsuki raised his arms in a half shrug. "Who can say? The Evas are capricious beasts. But I believe Pilot Soryu will do just fine. And all we can do is try."
冬月耸了耸肩，半是无奈地说："谁能说得准呢？这些 EVA 机甲本就喜怒无常。但我相信惣流会表现出色的。我们能做的，也只有尝试了。"

"Not getting sentimental on us, are you Fuyutsuki?" Ikari remarked with what might have almost been amusement in his voice.
"不会是动感情了吧，冬月？"碇源堂评论道，语气中几乎带着一丝戏谑。

"Just offering a suggestion. Besides, if this doesn't work, we are only out the cost of airfare for a thirteen year old girl."
只是提个建议而已。再说了，就算这招不行，我们顶多也就损失一个十三岁女孩的机票钱。

More like a thirteen year old girl and all the crap she'll want to bring with her, thought Ritsuko, who remembered what she had been like at that age.
更确切地说，是一个十三岁女孩和她想带的所有东西，Ritsuko 心想，她还记得自己那个年纪时的样子。

"I believe the Committee will be amenable to this," said Ikari. "Especially if I emphasise that our only other available pilot is incapacitated. For now I shall simply tell them that the spare was useless. We do not need the old men prying into this when even we cannot reliably determine the problem."
我相信委员会会同意这个提议的，"碇说道，"尤其是当我强调我们唯一可用的另一个驾驶员目前无法行动时。现在我先告诉他们备用方案无效。我们不需要那些老家伙来插手这件事，连我们都无法准确判断问题所在。

"Very well," replied Ritsuko with a nod. Then, as if only just remembering, she added, "And what about the spare in question? Shall I arrange for him to be sent back home?"
很好，"Ritsuko 点头回应。接着，仿佛刚想起似的，她补充道，"那备用方案中的那个人怎么办？需要我安排把他送回家吗？

Knowing the relationship, or lack thereof, between the two Ikaris, she believed she knew the answer. Therefore, his reply came as a complete surprise.
了解两位伊卡洛斯之间的关系，或者说缺乏关系，她本以为自己已经知道了答案。因此，他的回答完全出乎意料。

"The Third Child will remain in Tokyo-3 for the time being. Only when we are sure we have exhausted all possible avenues shall he be sent away."
第三适格者暂时留在第三新东京市。只有当我们确信已经穷尽了所有可能的途径，他才会被送走。

Ritsuko very carefully did not express any surprise at the order. Well I'll be damned, you might just have a heart in that chest after all. Out loud she said, "Then if there is nothing else, I'll be off. I want to go through the data from the Third's attempts myself. There has to be something we're missing."
律子非常小心地没有对这道命令表现出任何惊讶。好吧，我真是见鬼了，你胸膛里或许还真有一颗心。她大声说道："那么如果没有其他事，我就先走了。我想亲自查看第三适格者尝试的数据。我们一定错过了什么。"

"Dismissed." 解散。

The door closed behind the blonde scientist, and silence descended on the imposing black room belonging to the Supreme Commander of NERV for several minutes. Finally, Gendo raised his head a tiny fraction of an inch.
金发科学家离开后，门随之关闭，NERV 最高指挥官的黑色办公室陷入了数分钟的沉寂。终于，源渡微微抬起了头。

"This is a very strange occurrence, Professor."
教授，这真是件匪夷所思的事。

"Certainly not something we could have predicted."
绝非我们所能预料。

"But now we have to deal with the consequences."
但现在我们必须应对后果。

"If that's even possible."
如果这真的可能的话。

Gendo hummed in thought. When he realised that no further answer was forthcoming, Fuyutsuki decided to speak up about something that had been on his mind for a few days. "I don't suppose you understand what Ayanami said to him in the Eva cage, do you? Could that have something to do with this?"
源渡沉吟着思考。当他意识到没有进一步的回答时，冬月决定提出这几天一直萦绕心头的问题。“我想你也不明白绫波对他在 EVA 笼子里说了什么，对吧？那会不会与此有关？”

Gendo's eyebrows furrowed as he recalled the scene. His estranged son, cradling the injured girl he had just caught after she had been knocked from her gurney. Those three small words that he would have missed had it not been for the highly sensitive security cameras installed in the cages...
源渡的眉头紧锁，回忆起那一幕。他疏远的儿子，抱着刚从担架上被击落的受伤女孩。如果不是因为笼子里安装了高度敏感的安全摄像头，他可能会错过那三个简短的字眼...

"What are you...?" 你这是...？

Not 'who are you?', as if meeting a stranger for the first time, but 'what are you?'. Later, after reviewing the footage of the event, he had noticed Rei staring with great intensity at the Third Child, even as she was placed back on the gurney and wheeled away.
不是“你是谁？”，仿佛初次遇见陌生人，而是“你是什么？”。后来，在回顾事件录像时，他注意到零号机驾驶员在重新被放上担架推走时，仍以极大的专注凝视着第三适格者。

"I'm afraid I have no answer either, Professor," he admitted. "With Rei still in serious condition, and our workload thanks to the attack, it will still be some time before I can speak with her. For all we know it may have simply been a hallucination brought on by her medication and injuries."
“恐怕我也无法给出答案，教授，”他坦承道，“由于零号机驾驶员仍处于危重状态，加上袭击事件带来的工作量，我还需要一段时间才能与她交谈。据我们所知，那可能仅仅是药物和伤势引发的幻觉。”

"Whatever it is, I guess we'll find out soon enough."
“无论是什么，我想我们很快就会知道了。”

"But will we like the answer?"
“但我们会喜欢那个答案吗？”

Shinji was very unhappy. 真嗣非常不高兴。

Perhaps it was the way he had scowled at Misato as she'd waited to meet him outside the change room after the shenanigans on the bridge, or perhaps it was the way he was currently walking faster than normal, as if hoping to outpace her and reach the elevator first so that he could slip away.
或许是因为他在桥上闹剧后，在更衣室外等待时对美里皱眉的样子，又或许是因为他现在正加快步伐，仿佛希望赶在她前面到达电梯，以便溜走。

Misato's longer legs let her easily keep up with him, however, and made it into the elevator without any trouble. It ascended slowly, leaving the two of them basking in the awkward silence.
然而，美里修长的双腿让她轻松跟上，毫无困难地走进了电梯。电梯缓缓上升，留下两人在尴尬的沉默中。

"I'm really sorry, Shinji," she finally managed to say, shame written all over her face. "It was unprofessional of me to laugh like that."
真嗣，我真的很抱歉，" 她终于开口说道，脸上写满了羞愧。"我那样笑出来，实在是不专业。

Shinji huffed and folded his arms. "You promised."
真嗣气呼呼地抱起双臂。“你答应过的。”

"I know, and I apologise. I think the stress of the long day finally got to us."
“我知道，我道歉。可能是漫长的一天压力太大，我们都有点失控了。”

"...It doesn't matter anyway. I'll be getting sent back to my teacher soon, since I can't do the job I was brought here for."
“……反正也无所谓了。我很快就会被送回老师那里，因为我根本做不了被带到这里来的那份工作。”

Misato stared at him. Despite becoming the pilot of a multi-billion yen war machine, this was still just a young boy in front of her. A young boy who had, according to the file she had been given on him, lost his mother at a young age and was sent to live with a stranger for most of his life. Why his father, the Commander of NERV, had sent him away was a mystery, and it was unlikely she would be given an answer.
美里凝视着他。尽管成为了价值数十亿日元的战争机器的驾驶员，眼前这个在她面前的，依旧只是一个少年。根据她手头的资料，这个少年在很小的时候就失去了母亲，大部分时间都被寄养在一个陌生人家里。至于他的父亲，NERV 的指挥官，为何将他送走，仍是一个谜，而她也不太可能得到答案。

She opened a panel above the elevator's floor buttons and punched the emergency stop button. The sudden halt jolted the two occupants as she turned to look at Shinji. "Look, I don't know about the higher ups, but I'm not ready to admit defeat just yet. You're doing your best, but something isn't working properly. That's not your fault."
她打开电梯楼层按钮上方的一块面板，猛地按下了紧急停止按钮。突如其来的停顿让两位乘客都为之一震，她转头看向真嗣。“听着，我不清楚高层的想法，但我还没准备好认输。你已经尽力了，但肯定有什么地方不对劲。这不是你的错。”

"I know what's wrong!" exclaimed Shinji. "I sold my soul, so the Eva can't use its AT-Field! It is my fault!"
“我知道问题出在哪了！”真嗣惊呼道，“我出卖了自己的灵魂，所以 Eva 无法使用 AT 力场！这都是我的错！”

"It can't be that," replied Misato in what she hoped was a calming tone, "because selling your soul is impossible outside of fiction. It would have happened somewhere else in the world by now and we'd know of it."
“不可能有这种事，”美里尽量用一种安抚的语气回答，“因为除了小说之外，出卖灵魂是不可能的。如果真有此事，世界上其他地方早该发生了，我们也会有所耳闻。”

"But it's the only thing that makes sense! You guys said you went over everything, so what else could it possibly be?"
“但这是唯一合理的解释！你们说过已经检查了所有可能，那还能是什么原因呢？”

Misato shrugged helplessly. "I'm not the head of Project E, so I can't offer anything like a reason. But just signing a piece of paper wouldn't be enough to cause something like this to happen. Or... not happen."
碇真嗣无奈地耸了耸肩。“我不是 E 计划的主管，所以我也给不出什么合理的解释。但仅仅签个字，应该不足以导致这种事情发生，或者不发生。”

Shinji sighed heavily and leaned hard against the wall of the elevator. "I knew nobody would believe me. And I just know I'll end up back with my teacher sooner or later, since I'm apparently useless in a fight now."
真嗣重重地叹了口气，用力靠在电梯的墙上。“我就知道没人会相信我。而且我知道，迟早我还是得回到老师那里去，因为现在看来我在战斗中显然是没用了。”

The despondency in the boy's voice made Misato echo his sigh. This soul thing seemed just so ridiculous, and yet Shinji was adamant in his belief that it was the cause of their current problem. "How about this then? Find me something that can solidly prove you sold your soul and I'll argue right beside you to convince Ritsuko and the others."
男孩声音中的沮丧让美里也跟着叹了口气。这个所谓的灵魂问题听起来荒谬至极，但真嗣却坚信这就是他们当前问题的根源。“那这样吧，你找点确凿的证据证明你卖掉了自己的灵魂，我就站在你这边，帮你去说服律子和他们。”

"...You'd do that? For me?" Shinji asked as he slowly turned to look up at her, surprise on his face. "But I don't even know how I can prove it. And what if they punish you for wasting their time?"
“……你真的会这么做吗？为了我？”真嗣缓缓转过头，抬头看向她，脸上写满了惊讶。“但我甚至不知道怎么证明这一点。万一他们因为你浪费他们的时间而惩罚你怎么办？”

"Don't you worry about me," Misato replied, just as her phone began to ring. "Just focus on finding that evidence." She drew it out of her pocket and answered.
"你不用担心我，" 美里回答道，恰在此时她的手机响了起来。"专心找证据就好。" 她从口袋里掏出手机接听。

"Is everything alright, Captain?" It was Hyuga, the dark-haired young bridge officer that always seemed to go out of his way to help her. "I'm seeing an emergency stop alert for your elevator."
一切还好吗，队长？" 是日向，那位总是不遗余力帮助她的黑发年轻舰桥军官。"我看到您电梯的紧急停止警报了。

"Oh. Right." She should have realised that, in a place like NERV, there would be special contingencies for things like stuck elevators. "Everything's fine, I just, um... accidentally bumped the stop button."
哦，对。" 她本该想到，在 NERV 这种地方，对于电梯卡住这类情况肯定有特别的应急措施。"没事，我只是，呃...不小心碰到了停止按钮。

"...That button is behind a panel you have to open."
...那个按钮藏在需要打开的面板后面。

"I, um... bumped into it really hard?"
我，呃... 撞得挺狠的？

"Er... Understood, ma'am. I'll start the elevator back up for you." The elevator began to move almost before he finished talking. "By the way, Pilot Ikari's with you, right?"
呃... 明白了，女士。我这就为您重新启动电梯。" 他话音未落，电梯便开始移动。"对了，碇真嗣驾驶员和您在一起吧？

"Of course he is. Why?" Shinji glanced at her quizzically.
"当然在一起。怎么了？" 真嗣疑惑地瞥了她一眼。

"Considering what happened today I'm fairly positive he's upset with us, so the news I'm about to give you might help."
考虑到今天发生的事情，我敢肯定他对我们有些不满，所以我接下来要告诉您的消息或许能有所帮助。

"Lay it on me." 直说吧。

"Since Ikari's... you know... and Ayanami's still in hospital, Commander Ikari has decided to get the Committee to transfer the Second Child to us ahead of schedule to see if she can synchronise with Unit-01. She'll be arriving tomorrow morning and placed into your care."
因为碇的...你知道的...还有绫波还在医院，碇司令决定让委员会提前将第二适格者转给我们，看她是否能与初号机同步。她明早就会到，并交由你照顾。

"Oh really?" A smile erupted on Misato's face, only serving to further confuse Shinji. "That's great! But it's a bit short notice for me."
哦，真的吗？" 美里脸上绽放出笑容，这让真嗣更加困惑。"太好了！不过这通知得有点突然。

"...Says the woman who suddenly decided to take care of a teenager."
...这话出自一个突然决定照顾青少年的女士之口。

"Fine, I take it back. Anything else?"
好吧，我收回。还有别的事吗？

"Um... yes. Please tell Ikari that all three of us are sorry for laughing at him."
嗯...是的。请告诉碇，我们三个人都为笑他而道歉。

Misato agreed and gave a farewell before hanging up. She passed along the apology before adding, "There's also some good news. Tomorrow I'll..." She paused as a better idea came to mind. "I'll need you to come with me tomorrow. To get that good news."
明日香同意了，并在挂断前道了别。她转达了道歉，接着说：“还有个好消息。明天我会...”她顿了顿，脑海中闪过一个更好的主意。“明天你得跟我一起去。去接收那个好消息。”

"To... get good news? What do you mean?" Shinji was very confused now, but at least he didn't seem unhappy anymore.
"去...接收好消息？这是什么意思？" 碇真嗣现在非常困惑，但至少他不再显得不高兴了。

"It's a surprise!" 真是个惊喜！

XXX

"Misato, where are we going?"
美里，我们要去哪儿？

"It's a surprise!" 真是个惊喜！

"At 5:30 in the morning?"
早上五点半？

"An early surprise!" 一个早到的惊喜！

"...Are we going to the airport?"
...我们要去机场吗？

"Your surprise is getting flown in!"
你的惊喜正在空运过来！

"This early?" 这么早？

"Early surprise!" 一大早的惊喜！

Shinji tiredly rubbed his eyes and groaned. This was too early even for an early riser like him. "How are you so perky? The last couple of days you sounded like a zombie when you woke up in the morning." Hearing the heavy, clumsy footfalls and loud groaning sounds right behind him as he prepared breakfast had given him a minor fright.
真嗣疲惫地揉了揉眼睛，呻吟着。这对他这样的早起者来说也太早了。"你怎么这么精神？前几天早上醒来时，你听起来就像个僵尸。" 当他准备早餐时，听到身后沉重的脚步声和响亮的呻吟声，不禁吓了一跳。

"I have had so much coffee!" Misato excitedly explained as she tapped her fingers on the steering wheel of her Renault Alpine A310. "So much to sort out! Leftover paperwork from the Third Angel's attack! Preparations for A-... the surprise! Plus I knew we'd need to leave early so I had some more coffee!"
我喝了好多咖啡！" 美里兴奋地解释道，同时用手指敲打着她的雷诺 Alpine A310 的方向盘。"有好多事要处理！第三次天使袭击后的剩余文书工作！为 A-...那个惊喜做准备！而且我知道我们需要早点出发，所以我又喝了些咖啡！

Shinji leaned slightly away from Misato as an elbow flashed past his face. The woman drove like a pursuit stunt driver on a normal day, and apparently being just beneath the overdose point of caffeine made her exaggerate any arm movements she made. He was almost expecting her to make car noises, but the loud engine was probably enough for her.
真嗣稍微向远离美里的方向倾斜，以避开她挥舞的肘部。这个女人平时开车就像追逐特技驾驶员一样，显然，咖啡因摄入量刚好在过量边缘，让她夸张了任何手臂动作。他几乎期待她会发出汽车的声音，但那响亮的引擎声对她来说可能已经足够了。

Despite everything, somehow they made it to the airport without crashing or being pulled over. A flash of Misato's NERV identification got them quickly through security, and Shinji trailed along in her wake. Any attempt at questioning was met with something along the lines of "Surprise!" so he soon gave up. A rough idea of what was actually happening was starting to form in his mind, and his mood began to improve. Soon they were sitting near an arrival gate, looking out through the floor-to-ceiling windows at the airport runways, and all that was left to do was wait.
尽管经历了种种波折，他们还是奇迹般地安全抵达了机场，既没有撞车也没有被警察拦下。美里一亮出 NERV 的证件，便迅速通过了安检，而真嗣则默默跟在她身后。每当他试图询问时，美里总是以一句“惊喜！”搪塞过去，真嗣索性不再追问。他心中逐渐勾勒出事情的大致轮廓，情绪也随之好转。不久，他们坐在了到达口附近，透过落地窗望向机场跑道，剩下的唯有等待。

And wait. 继续等待。

And wait some more. 再继续等待。

Shinji regretted not bringing his SDAT, as when he looked up at a nearby clock, he saw that only half an hour had passed. He tried to get Misato's attention, but the now formerly-caffeinated woman was now dozing in her seat, and he didn't have the heart to wake her up. So he continued to wait. And just as he was about to fall asleep too...
真嗣后悔没带上自己的 SDAT 随身听，当他抬头看向旁边的时钟时，才发现仅仅过去了半小时。他试图引起美里的注意，但这位刚喝完咖啡的女士已在座位上打起了盹，真嗣不忍心叫醒她。于是，他只能继续等待。就在他也要昏昏欲睡之际...

He leapt out of his seat in shock when somebody tapped him on the shoulder.
当有人轻拍他的肩膀时，他惊得从座位上一跃而起。

There was a snort of laughter, then the stranger said, "Wow. Reckon I can hitch a ride next time? Because you almost took flight there."
一声嗤笑后，那陌生人说道：“哇，下次能搭个便车吗？因为你刚才差点就飞起来了。”

The somewhat familiar voice froze Shinji in the act of turning around for a moment. It seemed that his rough idea was right. He cleared his throat and swivelled to face the newcomer. The flame-haired girl he had spoken to yesterday was standing there, clad in a bright yellow dress, with a hand on her hip. Two black-suited men stood a few feet behind her, looking around for any threats. The suits were still a sight Shinji needed to get used to, but he at least understood that their job was to protect people outside of NERV headquarters.
那略带熟悉的声音让真嗣在转身的一刹那僵住了。看来他的粗略猜测没错。他清了清嗓子，转过身来面对新来者。昨天与他交谈过的那位红发女孩正站在那里，身着一件鲜黄色连衣裙，一手叉腰。两个身着黑西装的男人站在她身后几英尺处，警惕地环顾四周，以防任何威胁。这些西装保镖的景象，真嗣仍需适应，但他至少明白他们的职责是保护 NERV 总部外的人员。

He didn't know why she was still wearing the A-10 clips though. Weren't they only needed while piloting?
他不明白她为何还戴着 A-10 连接器。难道不是只在驾驶时才需要它们吗？

"Um... Hello Miss Soryu," he haltingly said in German. It was his first time speaking to her face to face, and he wanted to make a good impression. Using her native tongue seemed like a good start.
"呃...你好，Soryu 小姐，"他用德语结结巴巴地说。这是他第一次面对面与她交谈，他想留下好印象。用她的母语似乎是个不错的开始。

"Hel-" Asuka paused, then shook her head before replying in the same language. "No. None of that formal crap. Call me Asuka."
嗨-" Asuka 停顿了一下，然后摇摇头，用同样的语言回答。"不。别来那套正式的废话。叫我 Asuka。

"Oh, um... sorry. Then... hello Asuka."
哦，嗯...对不起。那么...你好，Asuka。

"That's better!" she said with a sunny grin. "It's great to finally meet you in the flesh."
这样好多了！"她带着灿烂的笑容说。"终于见到你本人，真是太好了。

"Um, yeah. You too." Shinji nervously mirrored the grin, before adding, "Wait, how did you know who I was from behind?"
呃，是啊。你也是。" 真嗣紧张地模仿着对方的笑容，随后又问道，"等等，你怎么从背后就知道是我？

"I didn't, but Misato's hair is hard to miss." Asuka glanced away. "Speaking of which, we're probably gonna need a luggage trolley for her."
我并不知道，但美里小姐的发型太显眼了。" 明日香瞥向一旁，"说到这个，我们可能得给她找个行李推车。

Shinji blinked. "Huh?" She pointed to where she was looking, and he followed with his eyes to see Misato slowly tilting sideways in her chair. "Oh. Right. Misato's still asleep."
真嗣眨了眨眼，"啊？" 她指向她所看的方向，真嗣顺着她的目光望去，只见美里在椅子上缓缓倾斜，"哦，对。美里还在睡呢。"

"Sleeping like the dead. She didn't drink and drive did she?"
睡得跟死猪一样。她没喝酒开车吧？

Shinji shook his head. "No, she just nearly overdosed on coffee due to NERV work and getting ready for you."
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，她只是因为 NERV 的工作和准备迎接你，差点因为喝太多咖啡而过度兴奋。”

Asuka smiled warmly. "Heh, nice to see she hasn't changed at all. Anyway, go get a trolley so we can take her out of here."
明日香温暖地笑了笑。“嘿，看到她一点都没变真好。不管怎样，去拿个手推车，我们好把她带出去。”

The two teens got a lot of odd looks thrown their way, as well as several members of staff and security wondering what they were doing. In fairness it was an odd scene, watching two teenagers push a trolley with an unconscious woman on it; Asuka's carry-on bag sitting on Misato's lap by the redhead's explicit request. Her escorts were no help, simply standing back and remaining silent, letting the teenagers do the talking. Fortunately, Asuka's NERV badge sufficed for keeping them out of trouble and they made it to the baggage carousel.
这两个青少年引来了不少奇怪的目光，还有几名工作人员和保安好奇他们在做什么。公平地说，看着两个青少年推着手推车，上面躺着一个昏迷的女人，确实是一幕奇怪的场景；明日香的随身包按照红发少女的明确要求放在了美里的大腿上。她的陪同人员毫无帮助，只是站在后面保持沉默，让青少年们负责交谈。幸运的是，明日香的 NERV 徽章足以让他们免于麻烦，他们顺利到达了行李转盘。

"Wait, this is it?" Shinji wondered aloud when Asuka only collected two suitcases before heading off.
“等等，就这些？”当明日香只拿了两个行李箱就准备离开时，真嗣不禁疑惑地出声问道。

Asuka gave an expansive sigh. "Yeah, I had to pack light and in a hurry, since NERV wanted me here as soon as possible." As they reached Misato's car, she took the keys out of the woman's pocket. "There'll be more stuff coming later, when Unit-02 is getting shipped over. That's a ways off though, so hopefully this will be enough for the time being." She stopped and thought for a moment before, with a sly glance at Shinji, before mumbling, "Eh, I can always just go out and buy whatever else I need."
明日香长叹一声，说道：“是啊，我得轻装简行，而且要快，因为 NERV 希望我尽快到这里。”当他们走到美里的车旁时，她从美里的口袋里掏出钥匙。“等二号机运过来的时候，还会有更多东西送来。不过那还早，希望这段时间这些就够了。”她停顿了一下，若有所思，然后瞥了真嗣一眼，低声嘟囔道：“嗯，我随时都可以出去买我需要的其他东西。”

"Oh. So... should we wake Misato up now?" Shinji asked once Asuka's bags were loaded into the car.
“哦。那……我们现在要叫醒美里吗？”真嗣在明日香的行李都装进车后问道。

Asuka looked at the still slumbering woman, before giving a shake of her head that sent her hair cascading about. "Nah, she's going to be horribly tired, will drive like a maniac anyway, and I don't particularly feel like being in a car accident on my first day here. Put her on the back seat, I'll drive."
明日香看了看仍在熟睡的美里，然后摇了摇头，让她的头发如瀑布般飘动。“算了，她肯定累坏了，开车也会像疯子一样，我可不想在来这里的第一天就遭遇车祸。把她放到后座去，我来开。”

"Oka- wait what?" “好——等等，什么？”

In response, Asuka rummaged around in one of her bags, before withdrawing a card and showed it to him. "I. Have. A driver's license," she said with a smug grin, as if that explained everything. Shinji's stunned expression prompted her to roll her eyes and add, "Yes, I'm fully capable of getting us home. Don't you trust me?"
闻言，明日香在其中一个包里翻找了一番，随后抽出一张卡片向他展示。“我，有，驾照，”她带着得意的笑容说道，仿佛这解释了一切。真嗣震惊的表情让她翻了个白眼，补充道：“怎么，我完全有能力把我们带回家。你不相信我吗？”

"N-no, I do trust you, I just... wasn't expecting that. Sorry."
“不，不，我相信你，只是……没想到这个。抱歉。”

Asuka smirked as she opened the driver's side door. "So then if there are no more complaints, let's go. Hope you remember the way home. If we get lost I'm blaming you."
明日香得意地笑了笑，随即打开了驾驶座的车门。“那么，如果没有更多异议，我们走吧。希望你还记得回家的路。要是迷路了，我可要怪你哦。”

Shinji gulped. He hoped so too, or they'd be wandering around Tokyo-3 for hours.
真嗣咽了口唾沫。他也希望如此，否则他们就得在第三新东京市里游荡好几个小时了。

Once Asuka's bodyguards peeled off to get into their own car, the blue Alpine pulled out of the parking spot, and they made it all the way out of the airport before Shinji realised he was tightly gripping the armrest out of sheer habit. Asuka might have been much younger than Misato, but she was driving the roadster as smooth as silk. If there were any police that saw a problem with someone of Asuka's age driving, the NERV license plates on the car would likely make them look the other way.
当明日香的保镖们各自上车后，那辆蓝色阿尔派便驶出了停车位，直到离开机场，真嗣才意识到自己出于习惯紧紧抓住了扶手。尽管明日香比美里年轻许多，但她驾驶着这辆敞篷车却如丝般顺滑。如果有警察对明日香的年龄驾车表示异议，NERV 的车牌很可能让他们选择视而不见。

"You know," Asuka suddenly spoke up, jolting Shinji out of his musing. "I was starting to get a little worried, what with you dropping off the internet for several days without warning."
“你知道吗，”明日香突然开口，打断了真嗣的沉思，“你突然几天不上网，我都开始有点担心了。”

"Um, sorry," Shinji replied. "When I got the letter from my father, I had to leave immediately. My teacher insisted. I didn't get any time to talk to you until... well..."
“呃，对不起，”真嗣回答道，“收到父亲的信后，我必须立刻动身。老师也坚持要我走。直到……嗯……我才来得及跟你说话。”

"Yeah..." Asuka nodded glumly, before brightening up. "But hey, what a coincidence this is, huh? You and me, two complete strangers on opposite sides of the world who've been talking to each other for years, and we're both Eva pilots!"
“是啊……”明日香沮丧地点了点头，随即又振作起来，“不过，这真是巧合啊，对吧？你和我，两个来自世界两端、素未谋面却已交谈多年的陌生人，竟然都是 EVA 驾驶员！”

"Well... I don't know about that right now..." Asuka raised an eyebrow, and Shinji quickly decided a change of subject was needed. "Anyway... I take it you know Misato well?" he asked as the car changed lanes to prepare to exit the highway.
"嗯...我现在不太清楚那个..." 明日香挑了挑眉毛，而真嗣迅速意识到需要换个话题。"不管怎样...我想你和美里很熟吧？" 他问道，同时车子变道准备驶离高速公路。

If Asuka was surprised by the subject change, she hid it well. "She was my guardian for a few years in Germany. Then she got moved over here and someone else took over. That person is Kaji, and he taught me to drive." She snickered a little. "Took a bit of convincing, but he eventually caved."
如果明日香对话题的转变感到惊讶，她掩饰得很好。"她在德国当了我几年的监护人。后来她被调到这里，换成了另一个人。那个人就是加持，他教我开车。" 她轻笑了一声。"费了点口舌，但他最终还是答应了。"

"...Who?" The way she spoke of him, it sounded like Asuka thought he knew who this person was.
"...谁？" 她提到这个人的方式，听起来好像明日香认为他应该知道这个人是谁。

Asuka glanced sidelong at him for a brief moment before returning her attention to the road. "Oh, has Misato not told you about him?"
明日香短暂地侧目看了他一眼，然后又将注意力转回路上。"哦，美里没跟你提过他吗？"

"No, I haven't been living with her for very long, and most of my time here has been spent at NERV in the hospital. So far I've only really been home for one or two days, and she's been at work. Morning and night are really the only times we see each other, and... well..."
不，我和她住在一起的时间并不长，大部分时间我都在 NERV 的医院里度过。到目前为止，我真正在家的时间只有一两天，而她那时都在上班。我们只在早晚偶尔见面，而且……嗯……

"Mmhm, she's still half-asleep most mornings."
嗯嗯，她大多数早晨还是半睡半醒的状态。

"Speaking of which, is it normal for her to drink a beer every morning?"
说到这个，她每天早上喝啤酒是常态吗？

"As long as I've known her, Misato's been like that. Beer in the morning to wake up, beer at night to help her sleep. Does she still do the shout?"
自我认识她以来，Misato 就是这样。早上喝啤酒提神，晚上喝啤酒助眠。她还像以前那样大喊大叫吗？

"You mean that 'yeaaaahhhhhh' thing?" Since they were in a car, Shinji refrained from doing the can slam that traditionally accompanied the yell.
"你是说那个'耶啊啊啊'的叫法？" 由于在车里，真嗣没有做出通常伴随这声呼喊的拍罐动作。

"I'll take that as a yes."
我就当你是同意了。

They drove in companionable silence for a while, heading down the off-ramp and soon arriving in Tokyo-3 proper. Shinji did his best to recall the layout of the city from the very few times Misato had driven him around, and somehow they made it to the apartment building.
他们沉默地开了一会儿车，驶下匝道，不久便进入了第三新东京市。真嗣尽力回忆着这座城市的布局，仅凭着美里带他兜风的几次记忆，他们竟然顺利抵达了公寓楼。

As Shinji was getting out of the car, he asked, "You said this Kaji person taught you to drive. Even with your convincing, why would he teach a... um... younger you?"
真嗣下车时问道："你说过这个叫薰的人教你开车。就算你再怎么有说服力，他为什么会教一个...呃...更年轻的你呢？"

"In case of emergency, mostly," explained Asuka, exiting the car and locking the door before moving around to the boot. "An Eva pilot is a critical asset after all. If I got into trouble and nobody was around to help, he wanted to make sure I could quickly escape or get to NERV by any means necessary. He also taught me how to hotwire a car for the same reason." She chuckled. "Then told me never to use that skill unless I actually had to, or he'd come down on me like a ton of bricks. And when he was done teaching me to drive, he gave almost the same lecture since I'm nowhere near the legal driving age."
以防万一，多半是这样，" 明日香解释道，她下车锁门，然后绕到后备箱。"毕竟，EVA 驾驶员是关键资产。如果我遇到麻烦，周围又没人帮忙，他希望我能迅速逃脱或设法到达 NERV。出于同样的原因，他还教我如何偷车。" 她轻笑一声，"然后告诫我，除非真的需要，否则绝不要使用那技能，否则他会严厉惩罚我。教我开车后，他几乎又重复了同样的训诫，因为我还没到法定驾驶年龄。

"Well this... doesn't really count as an emergency," Shinji mused, before turning to the car's final occupant. "But I think he'd understand. Anyway, how are we going to get her upstairs?"
嗯，这... 其实不算紧急情况，" 真嗣沉思着说，然后转向车内的最后一位乘客。"但我想他会理解的。话说回来，我们怎么把她弄上楼去？

"Upstairs?" Asuka looked up at the building towering over them and groaned. "Aw crap. What floor are we on?"
上楼？" 明日香抬头望向高耸的建筑物，叹了口气。"糟糕。我们在几楼？

"The seventh. There's an elevator, but we'd still need to get her there."
七楼。虽然有电梯，但我们还是得先把她弄到电梯那儿。

Asuka folded her arms. "Pfft. Screw that. There's security around here, right?"
明日香双臂交叉，“哼，去他的。这里不是有保安吗？”

"Yeah, Section Two guards this building." Shinji paused and looked around. "Wait, where's the car with your bodyguards? Did we lose them while driving here?"
“对，第二部门负责这栋楼的安保。” 真嗣停顿了一下，环顾四周，“等等，载着你保镖的车呢？我们开车来的时候是不是把他们甩掉了？”

With a dismissive wave, Asuka replied, "Chances are someone else took over the escort, so they headed off once we got here. Anyway where are the ones assigned to this building? Inside?"
明日香不以为然地挥了挥手，回答道：“估计有人接手了护送任务，所以我们一到这儿他们就撤了。话说回来，这栋楼里分配的保安呢？在里面吗？”

"There should be three in the lobby, two at the seventh floor elevator entrance, at least two more on patrol around that floor," Shinji promptly replied. When Asuka turned and stared incredulously at him, he added, "I've only been properly here for a couple of days, but so far there's always been men in suits at those spots."
“大堂应该有三个人，七楼电梯口有两个，至少还有两个在那层巡逻。” 真嗣迅速回答。当明日香转过身来，难以置信地盯着他时，他又补充道：“我正式来这儿才几天，但到目前为止，那些位置总是有穿西装的人。”

"Good, means I don't have to walk far to find them. Wait here."
好，那就意味着我不用走太远就能找到他们。你在这儿等着。

Asuka swiftly headed off to the apartment lobby, returning half a minute later followed by a slab of meat in a black suit. She pointed at Misato's sleeping form, still on the back seat of the Alpine, and the guard gently extracted her before heading off to the lobby. Asuka turned and followed, and Shinji almost said something about her luggage before realising what the sneaky girl had done. Fortunately for his arms, she really had packed light.
明日香迅速走向公寓大厅，半分钟后带着一个穿黑西装的壮汉回来了。她指向仍在 Alpine 后座上熟睡的葛城，保安轻柔地将她抱起，然后朝大厅走去。明日香转身跟随，而真嗣差点提醒她行李的事，随即意识到这个机灵的女孩已经安排妥当。幸好，她确实没带太多东西，真嗣的胳膊算是逃过一劫。

A minute later, they were at the seventh floor, where Shinji unlocked the door and let them in. The guard went straight for Misato's room, exiting empty handed a few seconds later and brushing past the two pilots without a word as he headed back downstairs.
一分钟后，他们抵达七楼，真嗣打开门让他们进入。保安径直走向葛城的房间，几秒钟后空手而出，一言不发地从两位驾驶员身边擦过，下楼去了。

"So..." Asuka looked around at the apartment, taking it all in. "Kind of a small place for three people."
那么..." 明日香环顾公寓四周，细细打量。"对于三个人来说，这地方有点小啊。

"More like three and a half," Shinji corrected.
"更像是三点五。" 真嗣纠正道。

"Half? What do you mean?"
半？你什么意思？

The other fridge hissed open, giving Asuka a jolt of surprise. A blue and white penguin with a red crest stepped out and stared at them.
另一个冰箱吱的一声打开了，让明日香吓了一跳。一只蓝白相间、头戴红色羽冠的企鹅走了出来，盯着他们看。

"Uh... What the hell is that?" Asuka finally managed to ask.
"呃……这到底是什么鬼东西？" 明日香终于开口问道。

"He's Pen-pen," Shinji replied as he headed for the regular fridge after placing Asuka's bags on the table. Pen-Pen had still been asleep when he'd left that morning, so he hadn't been able to give the penguin his breakfast. "He's kind of Misato's pet."
他叫 Pen-pen，" 碇真嗣回答着，一边走向常规冰箱，一边将明日香的行李放在桌上。早上出门时 Pen-Pen 还在睡觉，所以他没能给这只企鹅喂早餐。"算是美里的宠物吧。

"'Kind of'?" 算是？

Taking a tin of fish out from the fridge, Shinji nodded. "You'll understand soon enough. At least you didn't meet him like I did." He kept his face turned away as a blush of embarrassment grew on his face. That really had been an awkward moment, Misato's casual reaction hadn't helped, and there was no way in hell he was going to tell the whole story to anybody. Ever.
从冰箱里拿出一罐鱼，碇真嗣点了点头。"你很快就会明白的。至少你没像我那样遇见他。" 他侧过脸去，脸上泛起尴尬的红晕。那真是个尴尬的时刻，美里随意的反应也没帮上忙，他绝对不会向任何人透露整个故事。永远不。

The penguin hungrily rushed over to Shinji, who opened the tin and poured it into a bowl which he sat on the ground.
企鹅饿急了似的冲向碇真嗣，后者打开罐头，将鱼倒进一个放在地上的碗里。

"Pen-Pen, this is Asuka," he said as the avian began to chow down. Without looking up from his meal, Pen-Pen waved a flipper in the vague direction of Asuka.
"Pen-Pen，这位是明日香，"他说道，此时那只鸟儿开始大快朵颐。Pen-Pen 并未抬头，一边享用着食物，一边用鳍状肢向明日香大致挥了挥。

"Er... Hi." 呃... 嗨。

"Don't be surprised if you see him reading the paper." He received a disbelieving stare from Asuka. "I'm serious. I think he reads the stock reports. Misato said he's a genetically engineered warm water penguin. He was going to get euthanised when the experiment was over, so she took him in."
如果你看到他在读报纸，别太惊讶。"他收到了明日香怀疑的目光。"我是认真的。我觉得他连股市报道都看。美里说过，他是基因工程改造的温带企鹅。原本实验结束后他会被安乐死，所以美里收养了他。

Asuka stared at him, then at the penguin for a long time, before bringing a hand up to rub her face. "You know what? I'm just going to pretend it all makes sense. Where's my room? I need to sleep off some of this jet lag."
明日香盯着他，又看了看那只企鹅许久，最终抬起手揉了揉脸。"你知道吗？我决定就当这一切都合情合理。我的房间在哪？我得去睡一觉，缓解下这倒时差的疲惫。"

"Oh yes, it's just down the hall." Shinji started to move past her. "I just need to move my things out and it'll be rea-"
哦，是的，就在走廊那边。" 碇真嗣开始从她身边走过。"我只需要把我的东西搬出去，就真的可以了——

A hand on the back of his shirt collar stopped him in his tracks. Without even turning to look at him, Asuka spoke.
一只手抓住他的衣领后背，让他停下了脚步。明日香甚至没有回头看他，就开口了。

"You mind running that by me again? I must have misheard you."
你介意再跟我说一遍吗？我一定是听错了。

Shinji froze. Her voice had lowered, sounding almost dangerous, as if she was starting to get mad. He mentally went back over what he had said, trying to work out what he had said wrong, and turned up nothing. So he repeated himself.
真嗣僵住了。她的声音低沉下来，听起来几乎带着危险，仿佛她开始生气了。他在心里回想着自己说过的话，试图找出哪里说错了，却一无所获。于是他重复了一遍。

"I need to move my things out?" It wasn't supposed to be a question, but he sensed that he was treading on thin ice.
"我需要搬走我的东西吗？" 这话本不该是个问句，但他感觉到自己正踩在薄冰上。

"Are you saying there's only two bedrooms in this apartment?"
你是说这公寓只有两间卧室？

The ice began to creak.
冰面开始吱嘎作响。

"...Yes?" ...是的？

"Two bedrooms. Three of us are living here." Shinji almost corrected her, but one look at her face as she finally turned her head to face him sealed his mouth shut. "I'm a girl, and you're a boy, so we're not sharing the same room." Asuka leaned in closer to him, and he gulped nervously. "If you're so eager to give me the bedroom, then where the hell are you going to sleep?"
两间卧室。我们三个人住在这里。" 真嗣几乎要纠正她，但当她终于转过头来面对他时，一看到她的脸，他的嘴就闭上了。"我是女孩，你是男孩，所以我们不能共用一个房间。" 明日香向他靠近，他紧张地咽了口唾沫。"如果你这么急着把卧室让给我，那你打算睡哪儿？

Shinji pointed down the hallway. "T-there's a room across from the bedroom. I-I was just going to move into there."
真嗣指向走廊。"那-那边，卧室对面有个房间。我-我本来打算搬到那里去。"

Asuka headed down the hallway, pushing Shinji ahead of her. Only when they got to the door of the room in question did she finally let go so that she could open the door. Without saying a word she stepped inside and looked around, before exiting the room a few seconds later.
明日香沿着走廊走去，推着真嗣走在前面。直到他们到达那个房间的门口，她才终于放手，以便能打开门。她一言不发地走了进去，环顾四周，几秒钟后才走出房间。

"Shinji..." she slowly began.
"真嗣……" 她缓缓开口。

"Y-yes?" 是-是的？

The ice shattered. 冰面碎裂。

"What the hell is wrong with you?!" she almost screamed into his face.
"你到底怎么回事？！" 她几乎是对着他的脸尖叫。

"Sorry!" Shinji flinched away from her, shielding his face with his arms.
"对不起！" 真嗣从她身边缩了回去，用双臂护住脸。

"What possessed you to think that it was fine to get kicked out of your own bedroom and shoved into a damn closet?!"
你到底是怎么想的，居然觉得被赶出自己的卧室，塞进一个该死的衣橱里也无所谓？！

"I-I-I'm not getting kicked out," he stammered. "I'm g-giving it to you."
我...我...我没被赶出去，"他结结巴巴地说，"我是...是让给你。

"There's not even a bloody window in there! I could touch both sides of the room without even stretching! You'd be better off living in a toilet!"
那里面连个鬼窗户都没有！我不用伸直手臂就能碰到房间的两边！你还不如住厕所呢！

"Why are you so angry about this? It's my choice!"
你为什么对这事这么生气？这是我的选择！

Asuka closed her eyes and took a deep breath, letting it out again after five seconds. "Because you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself like this. I'm the newcomer, if anything I should be the one in the closet."
明日香闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，五秒后又缓缓呼出。"因为你不该这样牺牲自己。我是新来的，真要有人进柜子也应该是我。"

"You don't deserve that!"
你不该受这种罪！

"And neither do you!" 你也不该！

"You're going to need the space anyway, when the rest of your stuff arrives."
反正你的其他东西到了也需要空间。

"I can stick most of it in long-term storage."
我可以把大部分内容存入长期记忆。

"But-" 但-

"Would the two of you please knock it off?"
你们俩能不能消停会儿？

Both of them turned to face back up the hallway. Misato was leaning heavily on the archway leading to the living room, clutching her head in one hand.
两人转头望向走廊那头。美里正倚靠在通往客厅的拱门上，一手紧按着额头。

"It's Asuka's first day here and you're already arguing?" she growled. "What the hell is the problem?"
明日香才刚来第一天，你们就吵起来了？" 她怒道，"到底有什么问题？

It was not Misato the Roommate or Misato the Guardian in front of them at the moment. This was Misato the Superior Officer. Asuka and Shinji glanced nervously at each other, before Shinji stepped forward.
此刻站在他们面前的并非室友美里，亦非监护人美里，而是上级长官美里。明日香和真嗣不安地互望一眼，随后真嗣向前迈出一步。

"I wanted to give Asuka my room, since she would need it more," he explained.
“我想把我的房间让给明日香，因为她更需要它。”他解释道。

Before he could continue, Asuka jumped in. "And I'm not about to kick him out of his room and into a closet. He deserves better."
他还没来得及继续说下去，明日香便插话进来：“我也不打算把他赶出房间，让他住进储藏室。他应该得到更好的。”

Shinji nodded. "Basically, neither of us want the room if it means the other person doesn't have a proper bedroom."
真嗣点头附和：“简而言之，我们都不希望因为自己占用房间而导致对方没有合适的卧室。”

Misato blinked slowly at them. "You're arguing... over who should not get the room? Trying to give it to each other?"
碇真嗣和明日香面面相觑，然后异口同声地回答：“是的。”

The two teens looked at each other again, before answering in unison. "Yes."
“真是的，为什么不能简单点呢？”葛城美里嘟囔着。“难道就不能一起住吗？”

"Great, why couldn't this be something simple?" Misato muttered. "And sharing it is out of the question?"
“绝不可能！”明日香大声说道。“我们虽然认识，但还没熟到那种程度。我才不要和一个变态男生同住一室呢！”

"No way!" Asuka exclaimed. "We may know each other, but not that well. I'm not about to share a room with a perverted boy!"
葛城美里缓缓地眨了眨眼，看着他们。“你们在争论……谁不应该得到这个房间？都想让给对方？”

"I'm not a pervert," Shinji mumbled.
"我不是变态。" 真嗣嘟囔着。

Misato shrugged. "Why not just play Janken for it or something?"
美里耸了耸肩，"为什么不干脆用猜拳决定呢？"

"Play what?" Asuka tilted her head in confusion. As Shinji quickly began to explain, she said, "Oh, rock-paper-scissors. No, that'd still end up with somebody in a closet."
猜什么？" 明日香歪着头困惑地问。当真嗣急忙解释时，她说："哦，石头剪刀布啊。不，那样还是会有人得进柜子。

"Well then I don't know," Misato declared as she threw her arms up. "Neither of you want to budge on this and I'm still so tired I don't know how the hell we got home." Asuka opened her mouth to answer, but Misato raised a hand to forestall any comment. "Wait until I'm actually awake. I need more sleep before we head off to NERV and see if you can pilot Unit-01. In the meantime, keep arguing or whatever, but for the love of Yebisu, keep it down!"
那我就没办法了。" 美里说着，双手一摊。"你们俩都不肯让步，我还累得要命，都不知道我们是怎么到家的。" 明日香张嘴想回答，但美里举起一只手阻止了她。"等我真正醒了再说。我需要更多睡眠，然后我们再去 NERV 看看你们能否驾驶零号机。在此之前，继续争论或者随便你们，但看在叶比舒的份上，小声点！

With that said, the tired woman stumbled off back to her bedroom, leaving two chastened teenagers in her wake. There was silence in the hallway for half a minute, before Asuka broke it.
说完这些，疲惫的女人踉跄着回到自己的卧室，留下两个被训斥的青少年在原地。走廊里沉默了半分钟，随后明日香打破了沉默。

"So what do we do?" she asked.
“那我们怎么办？”她问道。

Shinji sighed. "I still think you should have it. You're the best pilot after all."
真嗣叹了口气。“我还是觉得你应该住那个房间。毕竟你是最优秀的驾驶员。”

"Me being the best doesn't mean anything here. We are both pilots, not robots or dolls. We both deserve proper living arrangements instead of a hole in the wall." Asuka tiredly rubbed a hand across her face. "This is just going to go on forever, isn't it? We can't both not have the room."
“我再优秀在这里也毫无意义。我们都是驾驶员，不是机器人或玩偶。我们都应该有像样的住处，而不是一个破洞。”明日香疲惫地用手抹了把脸。“这事看来没完没了了，对吧？我们总不能都不住那个房间。”

"No," agreed Shinji, before furrowing his brow in thought. "Wait... maybe we can."
不，" 真嗣同意道，随后皱起眉头陷入沉思。"等等...或许我们可以。

Asuka stepped back and folded her arms. "If I'm not sleeping in the same room as a boy, there's no way I'm sharing a closet with one!"
明日香后退一步，双臂交叉。"如果我不和男生同住一室，那我更不可能和他共用一个衣柜！"

"Er, that's not what I meant," Shinji sheepishly replied as he scratched at the corner of his mouth. He certainly hadn't expected such an argument to blow up like this, but now he believed he had the perfect solution. "Apart from Section Two, I think we're the only ones living in this entire building."
呃，我不是那个意思，" 真嗣尴尬地回答，同时挠了挠嘴角。他确实没料到会引发这样的争执，但现在他认为自己有了完美的解决方案。"除了第二区，我想我们可能是这整栋楼里唯一的住户。

"That wouldn't surprise me," Asuka replied. "Wouldn't want any rogue elements this close to saviours of the planet. But what does that have to do with..." She trailed off and her arms dropped to her sides as realisation struck. "Oh. Oooohhh. Instead of us arguing over who gets the bedroom here, you're suggesting we get our own apartment! You clever little boy! I might just have to take back what I said about you."
这我倒不意外，" 明日香回应道。"谁也不想让不可控因素离拯救地球的英雄太近。但这和...”她话音渐弱，双臂垂下，恍然大悟。"哦。哦哦哦。你不是在争论谁该住这个卧室，而是建议我们各自拥有一套公寓！你这机灵的小子！我可能得收回之前说你的话了。

Shinji had started to nod as Asuka got the idea, only to stop at the last thing she said. He decided it was better not to ask for clarification. "It would solve the problem and give you lots of space for your stuff when it arrives."
真嗣开始点头表示赞同明日香的想法，但听到她最后的话时又停了下来。他决定还是不要追问清楚为好。“这样既能解决问题，又能给你腾出很多空间放东西。”

"While still remaining close to Misato and under the same Section Two protective detail."
“同时仍然与美里保持近距离，并接受第二科的保护。”

"Oh... right." Shinji's enthusiasm waned slightly. "How would she react to this? She seemed so happy to have me as a roommate." Or maybe it was the fact that I tidied the place up and cooked for her, he carefully did not say out loud.
“哦……也对。”真嗣的热情稍稍减退。“她对此会作何反应呢？她看起来很高兴能有我这个室友。”或许是因为我整理了屋子还给她做饭吧，他心里暗想，但没有说出口。

"Well it's not like you're moving across the city. But then again, we don't even know if she'll allow it," Asuka mused. "At least, not until she's had a proper sleep."
“反正你也不是搬到城市的另一头去。不过话说回来，我们还不确定她是否会同意，”明日香思索着说，“至少得等她好好睡一觉再说。”

"Speaking of sleep," said Shinji, noticing her occasionally drooping eyes. "Weren't you going to have a nap? You'll need to be fresh for the test, so take my room for now. We can talk to Misato about this later."
说到睡觉，" 真嗣注意到她偶尔垂下的眼皮说道，"你不是打算小睡一会儿吗？考试前要保持清醒，先用我的房间吧。这事我们回头再跟美里说。

Asuka opened her mouth to argue, but a yawn came out instead. "Fine," she relented. "It had better be clean though."
明日香本想开口反驳，却打了个哈欠。"好吧，" 她让步了，"但愿房间干净。"

"Of course. Why wouldn't it be?" Shinji raised an eyebrow in confusion.
"当然干净。怎么会不干净呢？" 真嗣困惑地扬起眉毛。

"You're a boy." 因为你是男生。

"What does- oh." Said boy's face turned bright red. "No! I don't do anything like that!"
什么意思——哦。" 男孩的脸瞬间涨得通红。"不！我可不会做那种事！

Giving only a smirk in response, Asuka pushed past him and into the hotly contested bedroom. After a moment of staring into the room, she sighed and said, "If Misato does agree to this, I want a proper bed in my room," before closing the door.
阿苏卡只是轻蔑一笑，便推开他，走进了那间争议颇多的卧室。她凝视了一会儿房间，叹了口气说："如果美里真的同意了，我要在我的房间里放一张正经的床。" 随后关上了门。

"Um... okay?" Shinji lamely said, before shrugging and heading off towards the kitchen.
"呃...好吧？" 真嗣尴尬地说道，然后耸了耸肩，朝厨房走去。

### Chapter 03 It's my fault

Midday came and went before Asuka and Misato finally roused themselves from bed. Perhaps mindful of the fact that she would soon be driving, Misato didn't have her usual wake-up beer. Asuka declined Shinji's offer to make her lunch, stating that sitting in LCL didn't always agree with a full stomach. Having already ingested the viscous substance twice himself, Shinji agreed.
正午已过，明日香和美里才终于从床上起身。或许是因为考虑到即将要驾车，美里没有像往常一样喝醒酒啤酒。明日香婉拒了真嗣为她准备午餐的提议，表示坐在 LCL 中并不总是适合饱腹。真嗣自己已经两次体验过这种粘稠物质，对此表示赞同。

Misato drove to NERV in her usual insane way, potentially breaking at least three traffic laws but somehow not causing an accident. Shinji gave thanks for the fact that Asuka hadn't learned to drive from the mad woman. And for seatbelts.
美里一如既往地疯狂驾驶着前往 NERV，可能至少违反了三项交通法规，但不知怎的并未引发事故。真嗣庆幸的是，明日香并未从这位疯狂女士那里学会开车。还有安全带。

He wondered if the car had airbags.
他琢磨着这辆车是否装有安全气囊。

At NERV, as Asuka headed off to the changing rooms, Shinji said, "Good luck," to her retreating back.
在 NERV，当明日香前往更衣室时，真嗣对着她离去的背影说道：“加油。”

Asuka gave a lazy backwards wave and replied, "I'm the best pilot there is, so this'll be a breeze. But thanks anyway."
明日香懒洋洋地向后挥了挥手，回答道：“我是最棒的飞行员，所以这不过是小菜一碟。但还是谢谢了。”

Misato brought Shinji with her to the bridge, somehow managing to find her way without any problem this time. His presence earned him a raised eyebrow from Doctor Akagi, but she apparently saw no need to kick him out.
这次，美里带着真嗣顺利无阻地找到了通往舰桥的路。他的出现让赤木博士挑了挑眉，但她显然认为没有必要将他赶出去。

"Everything's ready on our end," Ritsuko said to Misato, before turning to address the bridge crew. "The Second Child?"
"我们这边已经准备就绪，" 律子对美里说道，随后转向指挥室的工作人员，"第二适格者呢？"

"Just entering the cage now, ma'am," replied Maya. One of the holographic screens shifted, now showing the view from a security camera pointing at Unit-01's berth.
"现在刚进入笼子，女士。" 玛雅回答道。其中一个全息屏幕切换了画面，现在显示的是指向零号机停泊位的监控摄像头视角。

"Purple and green?" Asuka's surprise and slight disgust came undisguised through the speaker.
"紫色和绿色？"明日香惊讶中带着些许厌恶的情绪，毫无掩饰地通过扬声器传达了出来。

"You're complaining about the colour?" Misato asked chidingly, causing the girl on the screen to look around for a moment before realising the voice was coming from the comm system. "It's only temporary, if everything goes well; then you can get back in your own Eva when it arrives."
"你在抱怨颜色吗？" 碇真嗣略带责备地问道，屏幕上的女孩一时四顾，才意识到声音来自通讯系统。"这只是暂时的，如果一切顺利，你就能回到你自己的 Eva 里，等它到了就行。"

"Unit-02 can't get here fast enough," grumbled Asuka as she folded her arms and glared at the purple behemoth in front of her. "Bad enough I have to try and sync with an obsolete model. Well at least it's not pink. Bah, let's get this over with."
"二号机怎么还没到，"明日香嘟囔着，双臂交叉，怒视着面前的紫色巨兽。"更糟糕的是，我还得尝试与一个过时型号同步。至少它不是粉色的。哼，赶紧结束这一切吧。"

The bridge crew began calling out orders and status reports, the technical words blurring together and flying over Shinji's head. The first start-up attempt failed, which didn't seem to surprise anybody on the bridge, but Asuka made several snide comments about the 'outdated piece of junk' she was sitting in. Several minutes of calibrations and technobabble passed. In the middle of it all, Shinji somehow heard Asuka mutter to herself.
桥员们开始下达指令和报告状态，技术术语混杂在一起，飞过真嗣的头顶。第一次启动尝试失败了，这似乎并没有让桥上的任何人感到惊讶，但明日香对“坐着的这堆过时破烂”发表了几句尖酸的评论。经过几分钟的校准和技术术语交流。在这期间，真嗣不知怎的听到了明日香自言自语的嘟囔。

"Come on... I gotta do this. I don't want Shinji to get hurt..." Then came a sudden yelp and Asuka glared at the camera. "Hey! Did one of you jokers bump the temperature control?! It suddenly just got warmer in here!"
来吧...我得这么做。我不想让真嗣受伤...”紧接着一声突如其来的尖叫，明日香怒视着摄像头。“喂！是不是你们哪个家伙碰了温度控制器？！这里突然变热了！”

The bridge grew gave each other confused glances, and even Ritsuko looked baffled. "We haven't done anything of the sort. Readings show the LCL temperature is still at thirty-five degrees Celsius."
桥本和同事们相互投以困惑的目光，就连律子也显得一头雾水。“我们并没有进行任何此类操作。数据显示 LCL 温度仍保持在三十五摄氏度。”

"Well something happened," Asuka insisted. "Eh, never mind, it's cooling down again."
“嗯，发生了点什么，”明日香坚持说，“哎，算了，又降温了。”

The second attempt appeared to go the same as the first for a minute until, with an audible rumble that Shinji could swear he felt in his feet...
第二次尝试起初似乎与第一次无异，直到一分钟过去，伴随着新治发誓能从脚底感受到的低沉隆隆声...

"Unit-01 has activated!"
初号机已启动！

"Yes!" cheered Misato as she pumped a fist in the air.
"太好了！" 美里挥拳欢呼道。

"Nice work, Asuka!" Shinji exuberantly added, feeling like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. NERV now had a real pilot to protect them.
"干得好，明日香！" 真嗣兴奋地补充道，感觉肩上的重担仿佛被卸下。NERV 现在有了真正的驾驶员来保护他们。

"Naturally," Asuka replied with a grin. "I mean, look who you're talking to."
"那当然，" 明日香笑着回答，"看看你在跟谁说话呢。"

Ritsuko was less cheerful, but there was still satisfaction in her voice as she asked, "What sync ratio are we looking at?"
律子虽然不那么兴高采烈，但她的声音中仍带着满足，问道：“我们的同步率是多少？”

"Holding steady at thirty-six point two," Makoto reported.
"稳定保持在三十六点二度，" 真琴报告道。

Ritsuko nodded. "Less than I hoped for, but better than I expected. Let's go through some quick simulations to get her acclimated to Unit-01. Oh," she added as a thought occurred. "Just to make sure, please project your AT-Field."
律子点了点头。“虽然比我期望的要少，但比我预想的要好。我们快速进行一些模拟，让她适应一下零号机。哦，”她突然想到，“为了确保安全，请展示一下你的 AT 力场。”

"Huh? Oh, sure." Asuka concentrated, and the air in front of Unit-01 shimmered for a moment.
"嗯？哦，当然。" 明日香集中精神，零号机前方的空气瞬间闪烁了一下。

"Field deployed," said Shigeru.
"已部署字段，" 志贺如是说。

Nearby, Maya frowned as a bit of data caught her eye. She called Ritsuko over, who hummed in thought as she tried to make sense of what she was reading. Eventually she said, "Might just be an error. Keep an eye on it though, and let me know if anything changes."
附近，玛雅皱起了眉头，一些数据引起了她的注意。她叫来了立子，后者沉吟着试图理解所读内容。最终她说：“可能只是个错误。不过还是要留意，有变化就告诉我。”

With that out of the way, the simulations started.
解决了那个问题后，模拟训练开始了。

XXX

Misato and the two pilots finally left NERV at around six o'clock in the evening. Her driving was a bit more subdued, but still more reckless than Shinji would have liked. They got home and Shinji immediately began preparing dinner before Misato decided to do it herself. As he prepared the meal, all three were in the kitchen to discuss the possibility of the two pilots getting their own apartment.
碇真嗣和两位驾驶员终于在傍晚六点左右离开了 NERV。葛城美里的驾驶风格稍微收敛了一些，但仍然比真嗣希望的要鲁莽。他们回到家后，真嗣立刻开始准备晚餐，但随后葛城美里决定亲自下厨。在准备饭菜的过程中，三人都聚集在厨房里，讨论两位驾驶员是否应该搬出去自己住。

"Well... I suppose that would solve the problem," Misato conceded. "But why not just have one of you move to the new apartment?"
嗯...我想这应该能解决问题，" 碇真嗣让步道，"但为什么不直接让你们中的一个搬到新公寓去呢？

Asuka groaned and rolled her eyes. "Because that still wouldn't be fair. One of us would be getting kicked out instead of shoved in a closet."
明日香抱怨着，翻了个白眼。"因为那样还是不公平。我们中的一个会被赶出去，而不是被塞进壁橱。"

Misato quirked an eyebrow. "Kicked out? I think you're starting to exaggerate a little, Asuka."
碇真嗣挑了挑眉毛。“被赶出去了？我觉得你有点夸大其词了，明日香。”

"The point is, this is the fairest thing for both sides."
关键是，这对双方都是最公平的。

Shinji turned the rice off. The meal was almost ready; he just had to wait for the meat and vegetables to finish cooking. This would be his first time cooking for Asuka, and he fervently hoped she wouldn't hate it. He wondered if it would be difficult to learn some German recipes. There was little doubt in his mind that at some point Asuka would make a request, and he wanted to be-
真嗣关掉了米饭的火。饭菜差不多准备好了；他只需等待肉和蔬菜烹饪完毕。这将是他第一次为明日香做饭，他热切希望她不会讨厌。他思索着学习一些德国菜谱是否会很困难。他毫不怀疑，明日香迟早会提出要求，而他希望自己能够——

"Shinji?"
真嗣？

-ready for it. At the moment, the best he could do was make an attempt at a Baumkuchen. Besides his language tutoring, there hadn't exactly been much demand for anything German while he had been living with his teacher.
准备好了。目前，他所能做的最好的事情就是尝试制作一个年轮蛋糕。除了他的语言辅导之外，在他与老师同住期间，对德国事物的需求并不大。

A chopstick bounced off the back of his head, and he turned around. Both females were staring at him.
一根筷子从他脑后弹开，他转过身来。两位女士都在盯着他看。

"Er, sorry," he said. "Got a bit distracted."
呃，抱歉，" 他说，"有点走神了。

"Thinking about what?" Misato asked, and Shinji groaned internally. She had said it in that tone of voice. The woman had definitely reverted back to Misato the Roommate. "About how you'll be living with Asuka? Nobody else around? Free to do whatever you like?"
在想什么呢？" 葛城问，真嗣内心呻吟。她用那种语气说话了。这位女士显然已经变回了同居者葛城。"在想你将和明日香同住的事？没有别人在？可以随心所欲？

"Misato!" came the twinned outbursts from Shinji and Asuka, both their faces turning red.
真嗣和明日香异口同声地喊道：“美里！”两人的脸都红了。

"W-we may be pen-pals," Asuka embarrassedly continued, "but that doesn't mean I'm going to... to just hop into his bed!"
我...我们可能是笔友，"明日香尴尬地继续说，"但这并不意味着我会...会直接跳上他的床！

Misato snorted into her hand. "Oh boy! I'm going to have so much fun teasing you two!" The two teenagers glanced at each other nervously, but their eyes shot back to Misato as she continued. "Even if I won't be seeing you as much as I'd hoped."
碇真嗣和明日香紧张地对视了一眼，但目光随即又转回到葛城美里身上，她继续说道：“即使我不能像我希望的那样经常见到你们。”

"Won't be-" Asuka began, before Shinji interrupted her.
"不会-" 明日香刚开口，就被碇真嗣打断了。

"Does that mean you agree to this?"
那意味着你同意了吗？

"Of course," replied Misato, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "If this is what you've both decided on, I can't very well turn around and refuse. Well, I mean... I could have refused, and stuck one of you in your own apartment, but neither of you would be happy with that. Besides, you'll only be next door." Her gaze turned wistful. "And I suppose you're both at that age where you'll need some privacy..."
当然，" 米萨托回答道，仿佛这是世界上最明显不过的事情。"如果这是你们俩共同决定的，我总不能转身就拒绝吧。嗯，我的意思是...我本可以拒绝，让你们其中一个住进自己的公寓，但那样你们俩都不会开心。再说，你们也只是住在隔壁而已。" 她的目光变得有些怀旧。"我想你们也都到了需要一些私人空间的年纪了...

Misato grinned at the sputtering and stammering she caused in her two wards. She gave them a moment to recover, then said, "So! When do you plan on moving over?"
碇真嗣和明日香被她逗得语无伦次，惣流·明日香·兰格雷咧嘴一笑。她给了他们一点时间恢复，然后说：“那么！你们打算什么时候搬过来？”

"As soon as possible," Asuka wearily replied. "Please."
越快越好，" 明日香疲惫地回答，"拜托了。

Despite how he felt about leaving Misato 'on her own', Shinji nodded in agreement. He wanted to talk to Asuka soon about the contract they had both signed several years ago. At the time it had given them a few chuckles when they spoke of it afterwards, and when Asuka had asked about the chocolate, he said it had been incredibly tasty. But now the contract was coming back to bite him in a way he never would have expected. There had to be something they could do about it.
尽管对于留下碇真嗣独自一人感到不安，但他还是点头同意了。他想要尽快和明日香谈谈几年前他们共同签署的那份合同。当时，他们在事后谈起这件事时还笑了几声，而当明日香问起那巧克力时，他说那味道真是美味极了。但现在，这份合同却以他从未预料到的方式反咬了他一口。他们一定得想办法解决这个问题。

"Alright then," Misato decided. "After dinner we'll move all your stuff next door. Speaking of which, is something burning?"
那好吧，" 葛城美里决定道，"晚饭后我们就把你所有的东西搬到隔壁去。说到这个，是不是有什么东西烧焦了？

Shinji yelped in surprise, and turned his full attention back to the stove.
真嗣惊叫一声，立即将全部注意力转回到炉灶上。

Apart from Asuka's grumbling about 'sleeping on the floor' when she gathered up the futon she would be using, the move went smoothly. Since all they had were personal items such as clothing, the rest of the house was almost completely bare. Asuka said that she would try to get more of the things from her German residence sent, but added that it might not be likely as she had already received pointed comments about how much was going to get shipped. In the meantime, Misato arranged for a delivery.
除了明日香抱怨着“要睡地板”，当她收拾起将要使用的蒲团时，搬家过程还算顺利。由于他们只有衣物等个人物品，屋子里其余部分几乎空空如也。明日香说她会尝试从她在德国的住所运来更多东西，但也补充说这可能不太现实，因为她已经收到了关于要运送多少物品的尖锐评论。与此同时，美里安排了一次送货。

"Right, that's all settled," Misato said as she ended the call. "By this time tomorrow you'll at least have essentials like toiletries and some furniture." Asuka opened her mouth, but she was quicker. "Yes, Asuka, I made sure you'll be getting a 'proper' bed. Now sort out who gets what room, preferably without arguing."
"好了，都安排妥当了。" 美里挂断电话说道，"到明天这个时候，你至少会有洗漱用品和一些家具了。" 明日香刚要开口，美里更快一步，"是的，明日香，我确保你会有一张'像样'的床。现在来决定谁住哪个房间，最好别争执。"

"Asuka should get the master bedroom," Shinji immediately said, and pressed on before he could be interrupted. "As I said before, you'll need more space. This apartment is the same as Misato's, so I already know that the other bedroom will be fine for me. The bedrooms aren't that much different in size anyway."
"明日香应该住主卧。" 碇真嗣立刻说道，并在可能被打断前继续说，"就像我之前说的，你需要更多空间。这套公寓和美里小姐的一样，所以我知道另一间卧室对我来说没问题。毕竟两间卧室的大小差别不大。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him. "How the hell do you know the size of Misato's room?"
明日香眯起眼睛怀疑地看着他，“你怎么会知道葛城小姐房间的大小？”

"When I was first cleaning up her apartment, there was quite a lot to do in her room." Shinji rubbed the back of his head, then shuddered. "There was like... a pile of beer cans stretching almost to the ceiling." The pile had fallen on him. It had taken a sticky, bad-smelling hour to clean the room up.
"当我第一次打扫她的公寓时，她的房间里有很多事情要做。" 真嗣揉了揉后脑勺，然后打了个寒颤。"那里就像...一堆啤酒罐几乎堆到了天花板。" 那堆啤酒罐倒在了他身上。清理这个房间花了黏糊糊、气味难闻的一个小时。

Misato folded her arms and harrumphed. "A couple more days and I would have completed Yebisu Tower."
美里双臂交叉，哼了一声。"再过几天我就能完成 Yebisu 塔了。"

Shinji was about to continue, but then he noticed the evil look Asuka was giving him. "Um... what's wrong?" he nervously asked.
真嗣正要继续说下去，但这时他注意到明日香投来的邪恶眼神。“呃……怎么了？”他紧张地问道。

"If you cleaned Misato's room, you must have also handled her dirty laundry," accused Asuka.
“如果你打扫了美里的房间，那你肯定也碰过她的脏衣服了，”明日香指责道。

"W-no! All I do is put things into the washing machine!"
哎呀！我所做的只是把东西放进洗衣机里！

Misato jumped in. "Scared of Shinji touching your things, Asuka?"
“美里跳了进来。‘害怕真嗣碰你的东西吗，明日香？’”

Asuka's face reddened at her teasing tone. "Scared? No, I just don't want a pervert putting his hands on my unmentionables!"
明日香的脸上因她的戏谑语气而泛起红晕。“害怕？不，我只是不想一个变态把手放在我的私密衣物上！”

"I'm not a pervert," Shinji mumbled. Again, he went unheard.
“我不是变态，”真嗣嘟囔着。然而，他的话再次无人听见。

"Ah, then there's a simple solution to that," replied Misato. "Just do the laundry yourself."
啊，那有个简单的解决办法，" 弥薩托回答道，"你自己洗衣服就行了。

"Wha- oh come on!" Asuka growled, then huffed. "Fine," she relented before stomping over to Shinji, looking him dead in the eye. "Mark my words. If anything of mine conveniently happens to go missing, I will know exactly who to blame."
什——哦，得了吧！" 明日香咆哮着，然后哼了一声。"好吧，" 她勉强同意，然后大步走向真嗣，直视他的眼睛。"记住我的话，如果我的任何东西莫名其妙地不见了，我会知道该怪谁。

Shinji gulped in a suddenly-dry throat. His first instinct was to angrily deny any allegations that such a thing would happen, but what actually came out of his mouth was a feeble, "Y-yes, Asuka!"
真嗣突然感到喉咙发干，不由自主地咽了口唾沫。他的第一反应是愤怒地否认任何这样的指控，但脱口而出的却是微弱的“是，明日香！”

"Good boy." As if a switch had been flipped, Asuka's mood changed as she gave him a cheerful smile. "Anyway, I suppose I'll take the master bedroom. Apart from the size they're identical anyway, right?"
"好孩子。" 仿佛开关被拨动，明日香的情绪瞬间转变，她给了他一个灿烂的笑容。“那么，我想我还是住主卧室吧。除了大小，它们不都一样吗，对吧？”

"Yep," confirmed Misato. "They've both got windows and good ventilation, as well as built-in wardrobes and doors to the balcony."
是的，" 確認了葛城美里。"它們都有窗戶和良好的通風，還有內置衣櫃和通往陽台的門。

Asuka blinked. "These apartments have balconies?"
明日香眨了眨眼。"這些公寓有陽台嗎？"

Shinji nodded. "They sure do," he said as he walked through the empty living room to the sliding door leading out to the balcony. The three of them stepped outside into the cool evening breeze. To their left and right were more sliding doors leading to the two bedrooms.
碇真嗣点了点头。“他们确实如此，”他说着，穿过空荡荡的客厅走向通往阳台的滑动门。三人一同走到外面，感受着凉爽的晚风。左右两边是通往两间卧室的滑动门。

"Ooh, I really like this," Asuka enthused. She looked to the left at the slanted wall that was used to partition the building's balconies. "And Misato's balcony is right on the other side. We could just climb right over to get to her place."
“哦，我真的很喜欢这个，”明日香兴奋地说。她向左看向用来分隔建筑阳台的斜墙。“而且美里家的阳台就在另一边。我们可以直接爬过去到她家。”

"Please don't," cautioned Misato exasperatedly. "We're seven floors up. I really don't want to have to report a death to NERV because you got lazy and decided to take a shortcut."
请不要这样，" 葛城美里无奈地警告道，"我们在七楼，我真的不想因为你的懒惰而选择捷径，最后不得不向 NERV 报告一起死亡事件。

"Spoilsport." Asuka stuck out her tongue at the woman trying to ruin all her fun.
"真扫兴。" 明日香对着那个试图破坏她乐趣的女人吐了吐舌头。

They stayed out on the balcony for a few more minutes, enjoying the breeze and discussing what else the apartment would need. Eventually, Misato turned and headed back inside, and the two teenagers followed.
他们在阳台上又逗留了几分钟，享受着微风，讨论着公寓还需要什么。最终，Misato 转身回到室内，两个青少年也跟着进去了。

"I think that's everything for now," said Misato. "I have a key to this place, and I'll get you two a key to mine. Tomorrow your stuff should arrive while you're at school so I'll leave my key with the Section Two patrol on this floor."
我想现在就这些了，" Misato 说。"我有这里的钥匙，我会给你们俩我那里的钥匙。明天你们上学时，你们的行李应该会送到，我会把我的钥匙留给这一层的第二部门巡逻队。

"Oka-wait what?!"
哦，等等，什么?!

Shinji backed away from a suddenly fuming Asuka.
真嗣从突然怒气冲冲的明日香身边退开。

"You'll be going to school with Shinji," Misato clarified. "I know you're already a college graduate, but it's important that you attend school while you're here. You may be a pilot, Asuka, but I want you to get as much out of being a kid as possible. You're only young once."
你将和真嗣一起去上学，" 美里澄清道。"我知道你已经是大学毕业生了，但在这里期间，重要的是你要去上学。明日香，你可能是一名驾驶员，但我想让你尽可能多地享受作为一个孩子的时光。你只有一次年轻的机会。

Asuka grumbled and muttered some things in German that Shinji would hesitate to say out loud, but she eventually, if reluctantly, conceded.
明日香嘟囔着，用德语嘀咕了几句真嗣都不敢大声说的话，但最终，尽管不情愿，她还是勉强同意了。

"That's all settled then," said Misato with a smile that Shinji felt was perfectly calculated to aggravate his new roommate. "Feel free to duck into my place tomorrow morning when you wake up so you can shower and breakfast and such. Goodnight, kids! Don't have too much fun on your own!"
那就这么定了，" 碇真嗣觉得，葛城美里带着那种完美计算过的笑容说道，显然是为了激怒他的新室友。"明天早上醒来后，随时欢迎来我这里洗漱吃早餐什么的。晚安，孩子们！自己玩得开心点哦！

And with that she departed, leaving behind a fuming redhead and a boy who felt like he was standing too close to a rumbling volcano.
说完这些，她便离开了，留下一个气得满脸通红的红发少女和一个感觉自己站在隆隆作响的火山旁的男孩。

He then opened his dumb mouth and tempted fate.
然后他张开那张愚蠢的嘴，挑衅命运。

"Are... you alright, Asuka?"
你...还好吗，明日香？

Asuka sharply breathed in, causing him to flinch away slightly, before letting it all out in a protracted sigh as she slouched forward.
明日香深吸一口气，让他不由自主地微微退缩，随后她长叹一声，身体前倾，显得有些颓然。

"I was hoping she wouldn't do that," she mumbled. "I've got two degrees, for crying out loud. What can I possibly learn by going through school again?"
“我本希望她不会这么做，”她喃喃自语，“我都有两个学位了，天哪。再回学校我能学到什么？”

"Seeing as I was home-schooled before coming here, I don't have an answer for that. It'll be my first day there too." Shinji tentatively took a step closer, then another when Asuka failed to react. "But please, at least give it a chance. Sure, you might not learn anything new, but we'll at least be getting out of here and doing something that isn't NERV-related. And who knows," he added with a shrug. "Maybe you'll make a dozen friends."
由于我来这里之前是接受家庭教育的，所以对此没有答案。那也将是我的第一天。" 碇真嗣试探性地向前迈了一步，见明日香没有反应，又迈了一步。"但至少请给它一个机会。当然，你可能学不到什么新东西，但至少我们可以离开这里，做一些与 NERV 无关的事情。谁知道呢，"他耸了耸肩补充道，"也许你会交到一打朋友。

Asuka huffed in amusement. "Well, at least I'd be going there with you. That could make it tolerable."
明日香轻笑一声。"好吧，至少我是和你一起去。这可能会让事情变得可以忍受。"

Shinji smiled. "Let's hope we end up in the same class then."
碇真嗣微笑着说：“那我们就希望能在同一个班级了。”

"Yeah, well... we'll sort that out when the time comes. In the meantime, I'm going to hit the sack. Hopefully my internal clock can set itself to the local time without too much hassle."
嗯，好吧……到时候我们会解决的。在此之前，我要去睡觉了。希望我的生物钟能顺利调整到当地时间，别太麻烦。

"Okay, goodnight, Asuka."
好的，晚安，明日香。

"'Night, Shinji."
'晚上好，真嗣。

The door to Asuka's new bedroom slid closed. Shinji turned to leave, beginning to think about how his first day of school would go, and almost missed the sound of the door opening again. He swivelled around. "Hmm? Asuka? Is there something wrong?"
通往明日香新卧室的门悄然关闭。真嗣转身欲走，开始思索自己第一天上学的情景，差点没听到门再次开启的声音。他旋即回头，"嗯？明日香？有什么事吗？"

The redhead didn't respond right away, instead moving closer to him while her face began to turn slightly pink. When they were face to face again, she finally said, "Shinji... it's really, really good to see you after all these years. I'm glad we became pen-pals."
红发女孩没有立刻回应，而是向他靠近，脸上泛起淡淡的粉红。当他们再次面对面时，她终于开口：“真嗣……这么多年后能再见到你，真的，真的很好。我很高兴我们成了笔友。”

Quick as lightning, she wrapped her arms around Shinji for a swift hug before darting off back to the bedroom and slamming the sliding door shut.
她如闪电般迅速，双臂紧紧环抱住真嗣，给了他一个快速的拥抱，随即飞奔回卧室，砰地一声将推拉门关上。

"...Y-you too," Shinji replied to the empty hallway.
  

He was tucked into his own bed before he realised he'd forgotten to ask about the contract.
他在被安置到自己的床上后，才意识到忘了询问合同的事。

XXX

"Um, hello, I'm Shinji Ikari."
嗯，你好，我是碇真嗣。

"And I'm Asuka Langley-Soryu! Charmed, huh?"
我是 Asuka Langley-Soryu！很高兴认识你，对吧？

Their introduction to Class 2-A went about as well as Shinji expected. Half the class stared at Asuka's hair, while the other half stared at... the rest of her. Only one person besides the teacher was actually polite, and that was the brown-haired class representative. Hikari Horaki swiftly introduced herself to Shinji and Asuka, and got them up to speed on the class laptops they had received from the front office before sitting back down again.
他们进入 2-A 班的介绍正如真嗣所预料的那样。一半的同学盯着明日香的头发，而另一半则盯着……她的其他部分。除了老师之外，只有一个人表现得很有礼貌，那就是棕色头发的班长。光里·霍拉基迅速向真嗣和明日香介绍了自己，并帮助他们了解了从办公室领取的班级笔记本电脑，然后又坐了回去。

Shinji was all ready to start paying attention to the lesson, but then the teacher began to talk about pre-Second Impact life. Confused, he looked around the class. Nobody, not even the class representative, seemed surprised. In fact, most of the students were already staring at their laptops. In front of him, Asuka turned and shot him a puzzled look, to which he could only shrug.
真嗣正准备开始认真听讲，但这时老师开始谈论第二次冲击前的生活。他感到困惑，环顾了一下教室。没有人，甚至连班长都没有表现出惊讶。事实上，大多数学生已经在盯着他们的笔记本电脑了。在他前面，明日香转过身来，向他投来一个困惑的眼神，对此他只能耸耸肩。

"Hey," came a low voice from behind around ten minutes later. Shinji twisted in his seat and saw a light-haired boy with glasses staring curiously at him and Asuka. "I'm Kensuke Aida. You two came to Tokyo-3 recently, huh?"
嘿，"大约十分钟后，一个低沉的声音从后面传来。真嗣扭动身体，看到一个戴眼镜的金发男孩好奇地盯着他和明日香。"我是相田剑介。你们俩最近才来到第三新东京市，对吧？

"Brilliant deduction," Asuka sardonically replied, before realising how loud she had spoken. She continued in a lower voice. "I would have thought the fact that we transferred to this school today would be enough of a clue."
精彩的推理，" 明日香讽刺地回答，随后意识到自己说话声音太大。她压低声音继续说道："我想我们今天刚转学到这里，这个事实本身就是一个明显的线索。

Light glinted off his glasses as Aida adjusted them with a smirk. "People have been leaving after the attack, fearing for their own safety, but you two came right on in. I wonder..."
光线在他眼镜上闪烁，相田带着一丝冷笑调整了一下眼镜。"袭击发生后，人们因为担心自身安全而纷纷离开，而你们俩却直接进来了。我很好奇……"

"What are you getting at?" Asuka's voice turned dangerous.
"你在暗示什么？" 明日香的语气变得危险起来。

Aida leaned in. "You two work for NERV, don't you?"
相田凑近了些。"你们俩是为 NERV 工作的，对吧？"

Shinji struggled to keep his face blank, but apparently even that was enough of a clue. Aida grinned widely, before glancing past the pilots at something, gulping nervously and making a great show of ignoring them. Shinji looked around and saw Horaki giving them a scathing glare. He blinked, then turned back to his laptop.
真嗣努力保持面无表情，但显然，即便这样也足以成为线索。相田咧嘴大笑，随后瞥了一眼飞行员们身后的某处，紧张地咽了咽口水，并故意装作没看见他们。真嗣环顾四周，看到堀崎正用严厉的目光瞪着他们。他眨了眨眼，然后转回自己的笔记本电脑。

Apparently he was so bad at keeping a secret that he'd accidentally outed himself less than an hour into the first day of school. At least nobody else had heard them, being focused on ignoring the droning of the teacher. He sighed and looked over the top of his laptop screen at Asuka, who just rolled her eyes at him before turning around.
显然，他太不擅长保守秘密，以至于开学第一天不到一个小时就无意中暴露了自己。至少其他人没有听到他们的对话，因为他们正专注于忽略老师的单调讲课。他叹了口气，从笔记本电脑屏幕上方望向明日香，她只是对他翻了个白眼，然后转过身去。

"So much for operational secrecy," he heard her mumble.
"所谓的操作保密也就这样了，" 他听到她低声嘟囔。

Lunchtime thankfully came quickly. Asuka and Shinji left the class, following the emigration of students towards the cafeteria. The moment they stepped up to the counter, Shinji immediately wished he'd thought ahead and made lunch himself. The cafeteria's menu selection seemed to range from bland to suspicious. Fearing for his continued existence, Shinji picked something he could actually recognise and moved off to a table. Asuka soon followed, having picked the same thing as him for perhaps the same reason. They found an empty table and sat down, and were hardly surprised when Aida sat down next to Shinji, which earned him a groan of frustration from Asuka.
幸好午饭时间很快就到了。明日香和真嗣随着学生们涌向食堂，离开了教室。他们一走到柜台前，真嗣立刻后悔没提前准备自己的午餐。食堂的菜单选择似乎从乏味到可疑不等。为了自己的生存着想，真嗣挑了一个他能认出来的食物，然后走向一张桌子。明日香不久也跟了过来，她选了和他一样的东西，可能也是出于同样的原因。他们找到一张空桌子坐下，当相田坐在真嗣旁边时，明日香发出了一声无奈的叹息，这并不令人意外。

"So if you're a NERV employee, do you know who the pilot of that giant robot is?" Aida asked as they began to pick at their food.
"那么，如果你是 NERV 的员工，你知道那个巨型机器人的驾驶员是谁吗？" 绫波问道，同时开始吃起饭来。

"What the hell makes you think we even work for NERV?" Asuka shot back, stabbing something on her tray with a plastic fork.
"你凭什么认为我们为 NERV 工作？" 明日香反驳道，用塑料叉子戳着盘子里的食物。

"Ikari gave no reaction at all, like he'd been expecting the question. Anybody else probably would have been confused-"
碇没有任何反应，仿佛他早已预料到这个问题。换作其他人，可能早就感到困惑了——

"Enough of that, Aida!"
够了，绫波！

A beleaguered Shinji looked up at the interruption. Horaki was there, carrying her school bag and a bento box, glaring daggers at Aida.
疲惫不堪的真嗣抬头望向打断他的人。洞木光站在那里，手里提着书包和一个便当盒，目光如刀地瞪着相田剑介。

"It's their first day here and you're already harassing them," the class representative continued as she sat down next to Asuka. To Shinji, she sighed and said, "Sorry, Kensuke's kind of obsessed with military stuff. But if he knows what's good for him, he'll keep his mouth shut."
他们才刚来第一天，你就开始骚扰他们了。" 班长一边说着，一边坐到明日香旁边。她对真嗣叹了口气，说道："抱歉，剑介对军事的东西有点着迷。但如果他知道好歹，就会闭上嘴巴。

Aida raised his hands in surrender before becoming intensely interested in his meal.
艾达举起双手投降，随后对饭菜产生了浓厚的兴趣。

Horaki proceeded to ignore him. "Hopefully, people will just think you're children of NERV employees, but I get the feeling that people are going to work it out eventually."
堀其继续无视他，说道：“希望人们只会认为你们是 NERV 员工的子女，但我感觉人们迟早会弄清楚的。”

"Wait," said Asuka. "We didn't even talk much when we first met you. How did you figure it out?"
等等，" 阿苏卡说，"我们第一次遇见你时都没怎么交谈。你是怎么发现的？

Horaki smiled. "Observation. There's suddenly a lot of men in black suits in and around the school, and I'm sure there's three more janitors than there were yesterday. In a way, NERV itself outed you two. You're obviously important if security here got tightened up this much."
堀木微笑着说："观察。学校内外突然出现了很多穿黑西装的男人，而且我确信比昨天多了三个清洁工。某种程度上，NERV 自己暴露了你们俩。如果这里的安保措施突然加强这么多，那你们显然很重要。"

Shinji and Asuka groaned simultaneously.
真嗣和明日香同时发出呻吟。

"Some people here aren't all that bright," Aida noted, "but I think even they will work it out when you disappear right before an alert."
这里有些人并不那么聪明，" 绫波丽指出，"但我想即使他们也会在你消失后不久的警报中明白过来。

"Let's just handle that when it happens," said Horaki, before shaking her head. "Anyway, I don't suppose you've seen Toji today, have you Kensuke?"
我们就等事情发生了再说吧，" 堀口说着摇了摇头。"对了，你今天见到东治了吗，健介？

The boy swallowed a mouthful of food and shook his head. "No, not for a couple of days."
男孩咽下一口食物，摇了摇头。"没有，已经好几天没见到了。"

Horaki's face fell. "I called him at home yesterday after school to try and find out what's going on. He said he'd been busy with something and would try to come in today."
小鸟的脸色沉了下来。“我昨天放学后给他家里打电话，想弄清楚到底怎么回事。他说自己一直在忙某件事，会尽量今天来。”

"Wait, he didn't tell you?" Aida asked, before sighing. "Well, I dunno if he would want me to tell you this, but his little sister got hurt in that attack. She's in serious condition in hospital, and Toji's there because nobody else in his family can spare the time."
“等等，他没告诉你吗？”相田问道，随后叹了口气。“我不知道他是否愿意我告诉你这个，但他的妹妹在那次袭击中受了伤。她现在情况严重，在医院里，而东治在那里是因为家里其他人实在抽不出时间。”

Horaki gasped, while Asuka's eyes widened. Shinji froze in the act of chewing a mouthful of probably food.
洞木倒吸一口凉气，而明日香的眼睛瞪大了。真嗣在咀嚼着可能是食物的东西时僵住了。

"Apparently she was in a building that got hit by the robot. Some rubble fell on her and Toji had to free her by himself."
显然她所在的建筑被机器人击中了，一些瓦砾落在她身上，东治不得不独自将她救出。

Shinji's stomach began to twist as he forced himself to swallow. He and Asuka stared at each other for several seconds, before he suddenly got up and stumbled off. Behind him he heard a clatter, but he kept moving, weaving in between tables. His gut churned as he made his way towards the nearest bathroom to the cafeteria. Somebody stepped through the door as he got near, saw the look on his face and swiftly backed out of the way, holding the door open as he almost ran in.
真嗣的胃开始扭曲，他强迫自己吞咽。他和明日香对视了几秒钟，然后他突然站起来，踉跄着离开。他身后传来一阵响声，但他继续前行，穿梭在桌子之间。他的胃翻腾着，朝着食堂最近的洗手间走去。当他接近门口时，有人走了进来，看到他脸上的表情，迅速让开，为他扶着门，他几乎是跑进去的。

As he reached the first stall, he heard a familiar voice order the boy away, but he didn't have time to think about that person's presence as he fell to his knees right as his stomach did a flip, and he proceeded to be violently ill all over the inside of the toilet.
当他到达第一个隔间时，他听到一个熟悉的声音命令那个男孩离开，但他没有时间去思考那个人的存在，因为他的胃突然翻腾，他跪倒在地，接着在马桶里剧烈呕吐起来。

He had been in that Evangelion. He had been too incompetent to pilot it, falling flat on his face the moment he tried to take a step. He had been unable to stop the Angel hurling him into a building.
他曾身处那台福音战士之中。他太过无能，以至于无法驾驶它，刚一尝试迈步便摔了个四脚朝天。他无力阻止使徒将他猛掷向建筑物。

He was the reason a young girl's life was now ruined.
他正是导致一个年轻女孩生命毁于一旦的原因。

A long minute passed before he felt brave enough to lift his head, taking several shuddering breaths to try and ease his roiling stomach.
过了一会儿，他才鼓起勇气抬起头，深吸了几口气，试图平息翻腾的胃。

"Whatever you're thinking right now, it's probably wrong."
无论你现在想的是什么，很可能都是错的。

Shinji looked over his shoulder. Asuka was standing behind him, hands on her hips and a discontented expression on her face.
真嗣回头望去，只见明日香站在他身后，双手叉腰，脸上带着不满的表情。

"It's..." Shinji winced at the acrid sensation still in his mouth. "It's my fault. I was piloting."
这是……" 真嗣因嘴里残留的苦涩感而皱眉，"是我的错，我当时在驾驶。

Asuka blew air past pursed lips. "And of course I'm right. Now get up." She lifted him by the back of his shirt and hauled him over to the sink.
明日香撅起嘴唇吹了口气，说道：“我当然是对的。现在起来吧。”她抓住他的衬衫后领，把他拖到水槽边。

As Shinji began to wash his face, she said, "NERV's the one to blame for leaving everything until the last minute. If they had anybody smart in that place, you would have been brought in at least a month ago. Instead, you show up literally at the time of the attack and have no chance to work out how to pilot."
当真嗣开始洗脸时，她说：“都是 NERV 的错，把所有事情都拖到最后一刻。如果那里有聪明人，你至少一个月前就该被召来了。结果，你偏偏在袭击发生时才出现，根本没有机会练习如何驾驶。”

Shinji was still rinsing out his mouth, so Asuka continued. "If you want something to blame, then blame the goddamn Angels instead of yourself. Got it?" He paused, and gave a slow and hesitant nod. "Good. Now let's get out of here before people wonder what I'm doing in the male bathroom with a boy."
真嗣还在漱口，明日香继续说道：“如果你想找人怪罪，那就怪那些该死的使徒，而不是你自己。明白了吗？”他停顿了一下，然后缓慢而犹豫地点了点头。“好。现在我们赶紧离开这里，免得别人好奇我怎么和一个男孩在男厕所里。”

There was only about ten minutes until the end of the lunch period, but Shinji and Asuka headed back to the cafeteria. Aida and Horaki were still sitting at the table talking to each other and looked up as the pilots drew near.
离午餐时间结束只剩大约十分钟，但真嗣和明日香还是返回了食堂。相田和洞木仍坐在桌边交谈，见两位驾驶员走近，便抬头望去。

"The food here sucks," Asuka immediately said. "Bad enough that it didn't sit well in Ikari's stomach."
这里的食物真难吃，"明日香立刻说道，"难吃到连碇的胃都受不了。

"Ah, I should have warned you," Aida sympathetically replied as he glanced at Shinji, who was maintaining the facade by holding a hand to his stomach. "Apparently the school's funding isn't all that great, so they've been cutting corners. Decent food seems to have been the first to go."
啊，我早该提醒你们的，"相田同情地回应，同时瞥了一眼真嗣，后者正用手捂着肚子维持着不适的假象。"看来学校的经费并不充裕，所以他们一直在削减开支。像样的食物似乎是第一个被牺牲的。

"It always is," said Asuka. She pushed her now cold food tray away and held her head in her hands. "Ugh, I don't want to eat anything else from this place, but I'm still hungry."
总是这样，"明日香说。她推开已经冷掉的餐盘，双手托着头。"唉，我不想再吃这里的任何东西了，但我还是饿。

"Oh?" Horaki perked up, before reaching into her bag and bringing out another bento box. "Would you like to have this then?"
哦？" 小鸟游抬起头，随即伸手从包里又拿出一个便当盒。"那你要不要吃这个？

Aida glanced down at the bento box and smirked. "Was that supposed to be for Toji?"
相田瞥了一眼便当盒，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。"这原本是打算给东治的吧？"

Horaki blushed and began to stammer, but Asuka came to the poor girl's rescue. "If that's alright with you, then sure."
小鸟游脸颊泛红，开始结巴起来，但明日香及时为这可怜的女孩解了围。"如果你不介意的话，当然可以。"

The bento was passed to Asuka, who opened it up to find a much better meal. She took one bite and Shinji watched her eyes snap wide open. Evidently it was far superior to the slop they had just been subjected to. After a couple more mouthfuls, she looked up at him. "Hey, you want some?"
便当被递给了明日香，她打开一看，里面的饭菜明显精致许多。她尝了一口，只见她的眼睛顿时瞪得老大。显然，这比他们刚吃的那顿糟糕的饭菜要强得多。又吃了几口后，她抬头看向真嗣。"嘿，你要不要来点？"

Shinji shook his head after a moment's thought. "No thanks, I'm not very hungry anymore."
慎思片刻后，真嗣摇了摇头，“不了，谢谢，我现在不太饿了。”

Asuka kept her gaze on him for a few seconds, before shrugging and returning her attention to the bento. She managed to finish the last bite just as the end of lunch bell rang.
明日香盯着他看了几秒，随后耸了耸肩，将注意力转回到便当上。她恰好赶在午休结束铃声响起时，吃完了最后一口。

Class 2-A's next subject was maths, and thankfully the teacher stuck to the subject instead of talking about Second Impact. As a result, the rest of the day passed far quicker than the morning did. Shinji and Asuka bid goodbye to Aida and Horaki at the school gate and headed home. Halfway there, Shinji's stomach began to rumble. Loudly.
2-A 班的下一节课是数学，幸好老师紧扣主题，没有提及第二次冲击。因此，下午的时光比上午过得快得多。真嗣和明日香在校门口与相田和洞木告别后，踏上了回家的路。半途中，真嗣的肚子开始咕噜作响，声音颇为响亮。

"Okay, there's one thing you can blame yourself for," Asuka remarked. "Turning down the offer of food."
“好吧，有一件事你确实可以自责，”明日香评论道，“那就是拒绝了食物的提议。”

"Sorry, but I definitely wasn't hungry when you asked me," Shinji sheepishly retorted. "At least we don't have far to go. Maybe I'll start dinner when we get ho-... to Misato's place."
抱歉，但你问我的时候我确实不饿，" 真嗣有些尴尬地反驳道。"至少我们不用走太远。也许到家——...到美里家后，我可以开始做晚饭。

"She's pretty much stated that her home is still our home, Shinji. Speaking of which, you did remember to get her key before we left this morning, right?"
她基本上已经表明了，她的家仍然是我们的家，真嗣。说到这个，你今早出门前记得拿她的钥匙了吧？

Shinji nodded. Misato had left a note on her kitchen table with her own key, stating that she would get their key when she went into NERV and that they could borrow hers for the day.
真嗣点了点头。美里在厨房桌上留了张字条，附上自己的钥匙，说明她会在去 NERV 时取回他们的钥匙，而他们可以借用她的钥匙一整天。

"Good. Wouldn't want to be locked out when you're hungry, would you?" Asuka looked thoughtfully skyward at the cloudless sky. "I suppose we could go out and get something to eat if that happened..."
那就好。总不想饿着肚子被锁在外面吧？" 明日香若有所思地仰望万里无云的天空。"如果真那样，我想我们还可以出去吃点什么...

"I don't have any money though," said Shinji.
"虽然我没钱啊。" 真嗣说道。

"Yes you do." The Second Child pulled out her NERV ID card and waved it in front of his face. "This also doubles as a cash card. Your pilot's pay gets put directly into a bank account-"
不，你有。" 第二适格者掏出她的 NERV 身份证，在真嗣面前晃了晃。"这卡还能当银行卡用。你的驾驶员薪水会直接打到银行账户里——

"But I'm not a pilot..."
但我不是驾驶员……

Asuka huffed at Shinji's interruption and waved a finger in his face. "You sortied against the Third Angel, making you eligible for hazard pay, so unless NERV has been spectacularly lazy or stingy, you do have some cash to your name. You should be able to use that card anywhere in Tokyo-3 to pay for stuff." She paused and frowned as she looked at her card. "Hmm, I'm not sure if it always uses the local currency or if you need to get someone at NERV to modify it. I'd better check with Misato before using mine. Wouldn't want to try and pay for something in Euros here."
明日香对真嗣的插话嗤之以鼻，用手指在他面前晃了晃。"你出击对抗过第三使徒，所以有资格领取危险津贴，除非 NERV 特别懒或者吝啬，否则你名下肯定有些钱。在第三新东京市任何地方，你都应该能用这张卡支付。" 她停顿了一下，皱着眉头看着自己的卡。"嗯，我不确定它是否总是使用当地货币，或者是否需要让 NERV 的人修改一下。我最好在用之前先问问美里。在这里用欧元支付可不行。"

"Speaking of Germany..." Shinji rubbed the back of his head. "Are you now able to talk about what you did there when we were pen-pals?"
说到德国..." 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，"你现在能谈谈我们做笔友时你在那里做的事情了吗？

"Well I star-" Asuka stopped walking. She looked down at the ground and clenched a fist. Shinji was about to ask if he'd said something wrong when she violently shook her head and said, "Eva training and college. That's all."
嗯，我本想——" 明日香停下脚步，低头看着地面，紧握拳头。真嗣正要问自己是不是说错了什么，她却猛地摇头说："就是 EVA 训练和上大学，仅此而已。

Something in the tone of her voice suggested that he had almost stepped on a conversational landmine. All he could do was attempt to dodge the shrapnel. "Oh. Um... sorry for bringing it up."
从她的语气中，他感觉到自己差点踩到了谈话的地雷。他只能尽力避开那些可能的碎片。"哦。嗯... 对不起，我不该提起这个。"

Perhaps she was looking for anything to change the subject to, because Asuka unfroze and continued walking. "You seem to apologise a lot, don't you?" she shot over her shoulder.
或许她是在寻找任何能转移话题的东西，因为明日香解冻了，继续前行。"你似乎经常道歉，不是吗？" 她回头抛出这句话。

Shinji moved to catch up to her. "Really? Sorry about that." He immediately winced at his choice of words, while Asuka gave him a pointed look.
真嗣赶紧追上去。"真的吗？不好意思。"他立刻因为自己的措辞而皱眉，而明日香则意味深长地看了他一眼。

"There's something we need to sort out after dinner, too," Asuka said after a few minutes of quiet. "You know what I mean, don't you?"
晚饭后我们还有些事情要解决，"明日香沉默了几分钟后说道，"你知道我在说什么，对吧？

It only took Shinji a second to work it out, and he sighed. "I'd forgotten about that. It was nice thinking that I was a normal person again."
真嗣只用了一秒钟就想明白了，他叹了口气。"我都忘了那回事了。能再次觉得自己是个普通人真好。"

"Knock it off with the self-deprecation," she barked, gripping his shoulder hard enough that Shinji could feel her nails start to dig into his skin. "We're going to sort this out and you'll be fine to pilot. Just you wait."
别再自贬了，"她厉声说道，用力抓住他的肩膀，以至于真嗣能感觉到她的指甲开始刺入皮肤。"我们会解决这个问题的，你还能继续驾驶。等着瞧吧。

XXX

It was probably the fastest dinner that Shinji had ever cooked and eaten. Spurred on by Asuka's insistence, he had made something quick and easy. Apart from Misato's portion, now covered and in the fridge for when she got home, there were no leftovers to turn into tomorrow's lunch, so he made a mental note to try and get up earlier to remedy that. The very instant that the dishes were cleared away, Asuka practically dragged him next door to their own apartment, where they stopped upon noticing that Misato's promised furniture for their place had most definitely arrived.
这或许是真嗣有史以来烹饪和享用速度最快的一顿晚餐。在明日香的坚持下，他迅速做了些简单易食的菜肴。除了给美里留的那份已盖好放入冰箱，以待她归来时食用外，并无剩余可留作明日午餐，因此他暗自记下，得设法早起以解决这一问题。餐具刚一收拾完毕，明日香便几乎拽着他来到了隔壁他们自己的公寓，一进门便注意到美里承诺的家具已如期送达。

The kitchen now looked almost exactly the same as Misato's, minus the penguin fridge, while the lounge room had a coffee table and a comfortable looking green sofa with matching lounge chairs. There was no television, which Asuka almost complained about before remembering that there was one next door. The bedrooms were almost carbon copies of each other. Perhaps whoever was handling the order had misinterpreted it, because both rooms had a Western-style single bed. There were even a couple of deck chairs out on the balcony now, which cheered Asuka up for reasons Shinji did not know and dared not ask about, considering the gleam in her eye.
厨房现在看起来几乎和美里的一模一样，只是少了企鹅冰箱，而客厅里有一张咖啡桌和一张看起来很舒适的绿色沙发，配以同色的休闲椅。没有电视，这让明日香差点抱怨起来，但随即想起隔壁就有一台。卧室几乎是一模一样的复制品。也许是负责安排的人误解了订单，因为两个房间都有一张西式单人床。阳台上现在甚至还有几把躺椅，这让明日香心情大好，至于原因，真嗣并不知道，也不敢问，考虑到她眼中的光芒。

After a few minutes of arranging their bedrooms to suit them, Asuka and Shinji met in the lounge room, where she slapped a familiar piece of paper onto the coffee table.
几分钟后，明日香和真嗣各自整理好卧室，来到客厅会合，她将一张熟悉的纸拍在咖啡桌上。

The contract. That Shinji had signed. Offering his soul for some damned chocolate.
那份合同。真嗣签下的。为了一些该死的巧克力而出卖了自己的灵魂。

"So how are we going to handle this?" Asuka wondered after a few minutes spent reading the contract once again. "It states that the pact is binding even if this paper is destroyed, so that option's out."
那我们该怎么处理这个？" 明日香再次阅读合同几分钟后问道，"上面写着即使这张纸被毁，契约仍然有效，所以那个选项行不通。

"Could we edit it?" Shinji suggested. "Wipe out the fill-in bits and put something else in?"
我们能修改它吗？" 真嗣提议道，"删掉那些填充的部分，换成别的怎么样？

Asuka hummed in thought. "I think that might count as physical destruction since you're removing something."
明日香若有所思地哼了一声，"我觉得这应该算物理破坏，因为你是在移除某些东西。"

"What about just writing over it then?"
那直接覆盖写上去呢？

After another minute of contemplation, Asuka said, "Well it can't hurt to try, can it?" She got up and headed to her room, returning seconds later with a pen which she handed to Shinji. "Since it's your soul, I think you should do it."
又过了一分钟的沉思后，明日香说："试试也无妨吧？" 她站起身，走向自己的房间，几秒钟后带着一支笔回来，递给真嗣，"既然是你的灵魂，我想应该由你来写。"

"Um, okay..." Shinji fumbled the pen, causing Asuka to click her tongue in exasperation. He sat down on the floor next to the coffee table and pulled the contract closer. He spent a moment re-reading the contract again, before touching the pen to the paper and-
"呃，好吧..." 真嗣手忙脚乱地拿着笔，让明日香不耐烦地咂了咂舌。他坐在地板上，靠近咖啡桌，把合同拉近一些。他花了一会儿时间再次重读合同，然后将笔触碰到纸上，准备签字。

"Excuse me."

"Huh?" Shinji looked up. "What's wrong, Asuka?"
嗯？" 真嗣抬起头。"怎么了，明日香？

Asuka was silently staring at him, eyes wide in shock. He called her name again, before realising that the focus of her attention wasn't actually on him, but at some point past his left ear. His heart rose into his throat as he slowly twisted his head around.
明日香默不作声地盯着他，眼睛因震惊而睁得大大的。他再次叫了她的名字，才意识到她的注意力并不是在他身上，而是越过他左耳的某个点。他的心提到了嗓子眼，慢慢地转过头去。

"Holy shit, I want my hair to look like that."
我去，我也想让我的头发变成那样。

Shinji's head stopped turning for a moment, as he quirked an eyebrow at Asuka's response to... whatever was behind him. A million possibilities for Asuka's state ran through his mind, but they were all wrong.
真嗣的脑袋停顿了一下，他扬起一边眉毛，对明日香对...他身后某物的反应感到好奇。关于明日香状态的无数种可能性在他脑海中闪过，但都不对。

"I believe we have something to discuss."
我想我们有事要谈。

A woman was sitting on the back of the lounge chair behind him, her sensibly heeled shoes resting on the seat cushion. She was clad in a business suit so black that it seemed to suck the light out of the room, but what caught Shinji's attention most was the hair.
一位女士坐在他身后的躺椅背上，她那双实用的中跟鞋搁在座垫上。她身着一套黑得仿佛能吸走房间光线的商务套装，但最吸引真嗣注意的，还是她的头发。

Whereas Asuka's red locks could resemble a fireball when she was in motion, and Shinji had actually thought of her at one point as 'flame-haired', this woman's hair was an actual ball of fire. It streamed down her back and was lush enough that she could potentially use it as a fiery cloak if she felt like it. Surprisingly there was no heat radiating off of her, and the chair she was sitting on was not bursting into flame.
明日香的红发在她动起来时宛如火球，真嗣曾一度觉得她就像“火焰般的发丝”，而这位女士的头发却是真正的火球。它如瀑布般垂落至她的背部，茂密到足以让她在想要时将其当作一件火焰斗篷。令人惊讶的是，她身上并没有散发出热量，她所坐的椅子也没有因此燃烧起来。

She raised an eyebrow. That was also on fire. "Are you going to just stare at me all day?"
她挑起一边眉毛，那眉毛也着火了。“你打算一整天就这么盯着我看吗？”

Shinji finally remembered to scream.
真嗣终于想起来要尖叫。

### Chapter 04 You May Call Me Bwynvienne

Before Shinji could get too carried away, Asuka reached out and slapped him across the back of the head. He stopped screaming and winced, bringing a hand up to where he was slapped, and gave her a confused look.
就在真嗣快要失控之际，明日香伸手在他后脑勺上狠狠拍了一巴掌。他停止了尖叫，痛得皱起眉头，用手捂住被拍的地方，困惑地看向她。
"What are you, stupid?" she asked. "Can't you work out who this is?"
“你是傻吗？”她问道，“你就猜不出这是谁吗？”
Shinji blinked owlishly at her, to which Asuka gave an exasperated groan and picked up the contract. "Look, right here," she said, pointing at a certain bit of text.
真嗣像猫头鹰一样眨巴着眼睛看着她，这让明日香发出了一声恼怒的呻吟，并拿起合同。“看，就在这儿，”她说着，指向了某段文字。
If at any time the details of this pact are called into argument, or an attempt to alter the pact is made, an agent of the Infernal Administration must be at hand to oversee the negotiations.
若此契约细节在任何时候被质疑或有人试图修改，地狱行政机构必须派员在场监督谈判。
Now Shinji felt dumb. That had been the line that had impressed upon the both of them that whoever had created the contract had put time and effort into it.
现在，真嗣感到自己很愚蠢。正是那句话让他们俩都意识到，缔结这份契约的人确实投入了时间和精力。
"Oh," he lamely said. "Um... sorry."
“哦，”他尴尬地说，“嗯……对不起。”
"At least one of you has a decent head on their shoulders," the newcomer remarked as she hopped down off the back of the chair to sit in it properly. Asuka turned her attention back to the woman. Or rather, as Shinji swiftly noticed, the woman's hair. He carefully prevented a chuckle escaping at what appeared to be jealousy.
"你们中至少有一个人头脑还算清醒。"新来者说着，从椅背上一跃而下，端正地坐好。明日香将注意力转回这位女士，或者更确切地说，是注意到她的头发。真嗣迅速察觉到这一点，他小心翼翼地忍住笑意，因为那似乎是嫉妒的表现。
The woman smoothed out a crease in her pants before speaking. "You may call me Bwynvienne." She gave a slight tilt of her head in greeting. "Since there appears to be both a dispute over the contract, and an attempt to alter it, I am here to adjudicate."
女子在开口前抚平了裤子上的褶皱，说道：“你可以叫我布温维尼。”她微微侧头以示问候，“既然合同存在争议，且有人试图修改，我特来裁决。”
"Straight to business then?" asked Asuka, to which Bwynvienne nodded. The girl then handed over the contract before retreating to the other couch. "We need to dissolve this contract. To cut a long story short, monsters are attacking, we're fighting back in giant biomechanical robots, and we're the only ones capable of piloting them."
"那就直奔主题？"明日香问道，对此，布温维尼点了点头。女孩随即递过合同，退到另一张沙发上。"我们需要解除这份合同。简单来说，怪兽正在袭击，我们正驾驶巨型生化机器人反击，而我们是唯一能操控它们的人。"
She pointed at Shinji. "Without a soul, Shinji here has been rendered almost completely ineffective, since he can't use one of the robot's primary tools. I want to give him his soul back."
她指向真嗣，说道：“由于没有灵魂，真嗣几乎完全失去了作用，因为他无法使用机器人的一项主要工具。我想帮他找回灵魂。”
"You should have thought of that before signing," Bwynvienne remarked as her gaze swept over the contract. She suppressed a smirk, but Shinji didn't understand what there was to grin about.
"签字前就该想到这一点，"布温维耶扫视着合同说道。她强忍住笑意，但真嗣不明白这有什么好笑的。
"Well neither of us even knew that the soul existed," argued Asuka. "Or that something I found on the internet would actually work."
“我们俩甚至都不知道灵魂是否存在，”明日香争辩道，“更没想到我在网上找到的东西居然真的有效。”
"Internet?" Bwynvienne frowned, looking up at the two teenagers.
"互联网？" 布温维尼皱起眉头，抬头望向那两个青少年。
"A world-wide computer network system," Shinji explained. "It lets us electronically communicate all across the globe."
"一个全球性的计算机网络系统，" 真嗣解释道，"它让我们能够电子化地与全球各地进行通信。"
"Oh, that. We have something similar, it's just called something else."
哦，那个啊。我们也有类似的东西，只是叫法不同而已。
"Anyway," continued Asuka. "I saw somebody give someone else a contract that looked just like the one in your hand. I found a copy of it on the internet and showed Shinji because it looked ridiculous."
“不管怎样，”明日香继续说道，“我看到有人给了另一个人一份合同，看起来和你手上的那份一模一样。我在网上找到了它的副本，因为看起来很荒谬，所以给真嗣看了。”
Shinji jumped in with his side of the story. "I printed it out, signed it, and mailed it to Asuka. She signed it then sent me the promised chocolate."
真嗣插话进来，讲述了他的版本：“我把它打印出来，签了名，然后寄给了明日香。她签了字，随后给我寄来了约定的巧克力。”
"You obviously didn't believe your soul was worth much if you sold it for some confections," Bwynvienne quipped.
"如果你为了几块甜点就出卖灵魂，显然你并不认为它有多值钱。" 布温维耶讥讽道。
"We didn't believe the contract was worth much," Asuka corrected. "We thought it was just a product of somebody with a vivid imagination and too much time on their hands."
"我们并不认为那份合同有多大价值，"飞鸟纠正道，"我们当时觉得那不过是某个想象力丰富且闲暇过多的人的产物。"
"Hrmm." Bwynvienne put the contract down and leaned back in the chair, bringing her hands together in front of her face. She tapped her index fingers together. "An interesting story, but there's one problem with it. You're lying to me about something."
"嗯……" 布温维尼放下合同，靠在椅背上，双手在面前交叠，食指轻敲。"故事挺有意思，但有个问题。你在某件事上对我撒了谎。"
Asuka flinched slightly as the woman leaned forward and levelled a steely glare at her. "W-what?!" she stammered. "What am I lying about?"
明日香微微一缩，因为那女人倾身向前，用冷硬的目光直视着她。“什、什么？！”她结巴着问，“我撒了什么谎？”
"Don't try and play dumb. I've had hundreds of years experience in the Infernal Resources department. I can tell when somebody's not being straight with me. You claimed that neither of you knew the soul existed, but we both know the truth, don't we?"
别装傻了。我在地狱资源部有数百年的经验，能看出谁对我不够坦诚。你们声称都不知道灵魂的存在，但我们心知肚明真相，不是吗？
Shinji turned a shocked look onto his roommate, who blushed and looked away. "Is... that true?"
真嗣震惊地看向室友，只见对方脸颊泛红，目光躲闪。“那……是真的吗？”
"...Yeah," Asuka dully replied, before she looked up angrily. "But it wasn't out of malice, it was a NERV security thing! I wasn't allowed to discuss anything about being a pilot. Hell, I even had to give you a fake name! I couldn't work out what to say when you asked me, so I decided to be careful by lying to you."
...嗯，" 明日香无精打采地回答，随后愤怒地抬起头。"但这并非出于恶意，而是 NERV 的安全规定！我不能谈论任何关于成为驾驶员的事情。见鬼，我甚至不得不给你一个假名字！当你问我时，我不知道该说什么，所以我决定通过对你撒谎来谨慎行事。
Shinji stared silently at her for a moment, before sighing and rubbing the back of his head. "Well, I can't say I would have believed you if you had told the truth. Not without a way to back it up."
真嗣默默地盯着她看了一会儿，然后叹了口气，揉了揉后脑勺。"好吧，我得说，如果你当时告诉我真相，我也不会相信。没有证据支持的话。"
"Which I wouldn't have been able to give anyway." Asuka turned to Bwynvienne. "Wait, I gave a false name. Wouldn't that make the contract void, since 'Agatha' doesn't exist?"
反正我也给不了。" 明日香转向布温维尼。"等等，我用了假名。那不是意味着合同无效吗，因为'阿加莎'根本不存在？
Bwynvienne smiled. "Actually, our paperwork allows for... alternative names. Aliases and such. My full and official name is far longer than just what I've told you. Infernals live a very long time, and pick up quite a few extensions to their names. Even if you're only writing it once, some names can take up a paragraph or more. Besides, you received the contract, signed it, and delivered the good requested in trade. For the purposes of the contract, you are Agatha."
布温维尼微笑道："实际上，我们的文件允许使用...替代名字。比如别名之类的。我的全名和官方名字远不止我告诉你的那些。恶魔们活得非常久，名字上会积累很多附加部分。即便你只写一次，有些名字也可能占满一段话。况且，你收到了合同，签了字，并交付了交易中要求的物品。就合同而言，你就是阿加莎。"
"Oh. Shit."
哦。该死。
Shinji was thinking the same thing about another potential avenue being closed down. "Well... are you able to help us at all?" he asked of Bwynvienne. "It's really important that I get my soul back. I can't do the job I was brought here for."
真嗣也在思考另一条可能的道路被封闭的情况。"那么...你能帮我们吗？"他向布温维恩问道。"我真的需要找回我的灵魂。我无法完成我被召唤到这里来的任务。"
"I understand that," Bwynvienne replied, before letting out a sigh accompanied by a small shake of her head. "Unfortunately, I'm unable to void this contract."
我明白这一点，" 布温维尼回答道，随后叹了口气，轻轻摇了摇头。"不幸的是，我无法废除这份合同。
"Why the hell not?!" Asuka exploded.
"为什么不行？！" 明日香爆发了。
The literally flame-haired woman gave her a frosty look. "The contract can only be voided during the cooling-off period, or if it is discovered that one of the signers was either under duress or maliciously ill-informed about the contract. Both of you read and understood the contract just fine, neither of you were forced to sign, and we've settled the lie of omission in a satisfactory manner."
那位名副其实的红发女子冷冷地看了她一眼，说道：“合同只有在冷静期内或发现签约一方受到胁迫或恶意误导关于合同内容时才能作废。你们双方都清楚地阅读并理解了合同，没有人被迫签字，而且我们已经妥善处理了隐瞒真相的问题。”
"Wait, how do you know neither of us was forced to sign?" Shinji confusedly asked. "We didn't see you when we put our signature on the contract."
“等等，你怎么知道我们俩都没有被迫签字？” 真嗣困惑地问道，“我们签字的时候并没有看到你。”
"When a contract is being signed, we are given pertinent information about the situation to ensure no duress or lies. If one of those had happened, the contract would have never come into effect. You may not see the Infernal Administration, but rest assured we see you."
当签署合同时，我们会获得有关情况的必要信息，以确保没有胁迫或谎言。如果发生其中任何一种情况，合同就永远不会生效。你可能看不见地狱行政机构，但请放心，我们正注视着你。
"That's... not very assuring," Shinji mumbled.
"这...不太令人安心，" 真嗣喃喃自语道。
Asuka's eyes widened. "You mean you knew already exactly what I was lying about?"
明日香的眼睛睁大了。“你的意思是，你早就完全知道我在撒谎的内容了？”
Bwynvienne nodded. "Correct. I simply wanted you to come clean about it."
布温维尼点点头。“没错。我只是想让你自己坦白。”
The younger redhead collapsed back into her chair and groaned. "So what the hell are we supposed to do? He needs his soul back and I can't give it to him. Just how long are we going to have to wait?"
年轻的红发女子瘫坐回椅子上，呻吟道：“那我们到底该怎么办？他需要找回他的灵魂，而我无法给他。我们究竟还要等多久？”
"Five years. After that, the contract's lock wait expires and a new pact can be formed."
“五年。之后，合同的锁定等待期就会到期，可以缔结新的契约。”
"Great, we might all be dead by then..." Asuka's eyes stared blankly at the ceiling for a few seconds, then she got to her feet. "Wait, can't we just make a new contract? One where I give him back his soul in exchange for..." She waved her arms about. "...something?"
太好了，到那时我们可能都死了……" 明日香的眼神空洞地盯着天花板几秒钟，然后站了起来。"等等，我们不能重新订个契约吗？我把他灵魂还回去，换取……" 她挥舞着双臂，"……换取什么呢？
Bwynvienne shook her head sadly. "While that would be a way to deal with your problem," she cleared her throat, and began to sound as if she was quoting something, "no party to a contract involving a transferral of souls may enter into another such contract within five years of entering into the first."
布温维尼摇了摇头，神情哀伤。"虽然那样可以解决你的问题，" 她清了清嗓子，开始像是在引用什么，"但任何涉及灵魂转移契约的一方，在签订第一份契约后的五年内，不得再签订此类契约。"
Once again, Asuka fell back into her chair. "Well we're screwed then."
又一次，明日香跌坐回椅子上。“那我们完蛋了。”
"Hang on," Shinji cut in. "If the contract is only active for a certain amount of time, wouldn't I get my soul back anyway once the contract dissolves?"
“等等，” 真嗣插话道，“如果合同只在一定时间内有效，那合同解除后，我的灵魂不就自然回来了吗？”
"No. The transferral of a soul is permanent," Bwynvienne clarified. "The contract itself is there to stop rapid soul collection; something we once had problems with a very long time ago." She gave a helpless shrug. "I wish I could help you, I really do. But these things are taken very seriously. It would require the intervention of somebody much higher up the Administration's ladder to even consider prematurely dissolving the contract, and they're all too important to waste time on insects like you. Their words, not mine, sorry."
不，灵魂的转移是永久性的，" 布温维恩澄清道。"契约本身是为了防止快速收集灵魂；很久以前我们曾因此遇到过问题。" 她无奈地耸了耸肩。"我真希望能帮到你，真的。但这些事情非常严肃。要提前解除契约，需要行政体系中更高层级的人介入，而他们太重要了，不会浪费时间在像你这样的小人物身上。这是他们的话，不是我的，抱歉。
Shinji slouched forward and sighed. "It's fine... it's not your fault."
真嗣向前倾身，叹了口气。"没关系...这不是你的错。"
Asuka looked like she was about to say something, but before a sound could leave her mouth, the front door of their new apartment opened and three men in black suits stormed in. Shinji and Asuka got to their feet to see what the commotion was, but the agents of Section Two were already at the entrance to the lounge room, aiming their pistols at the back of the Infernal's head. The one on the left, as far as Shinji could tell, was the same man who had carried Misato to her apartment.
明日香看起来像是要说什么，但还没等她发出声音，他们新公寓的前门就被打开了，三个穿黑西装的男人冲了进来。真嗣和明日香站起身来查看骚动的原因，但第二课的特工们已经到了客厅入口，用手枪瞄准了恶魔的后脑勺。左边的那个人，据真嗣所知，就是那个把葛城送到她公寓的人。
Bwynvienne turned in her seat and glared at the intruders. "If you don't mind, I'm in the middle of a meeting," she said in the tone of an angry teacher catching a student talking during class.
布温维涅转过身，怒视着闯入者。“如果你们不介意的话，我正在开会，”她用一种愤怒的老师抓到学生在课堂上讲话的语气说道。
The tallest agent seemed immune to her matronly glare, as he shouted, "Step away from the Children and place your hands behind your head!"
那位最高的特工似乎对她的严厉目光免疫，他大声喊道：“远离孩子们，把双手放在脑后！”
She slowly stood up, keeping her eyes on the agents, and crossed her arms as she stood before them. "I don't appreciate interruptions, young man."
她缓缓站起身，目光紧盯着特工们，交叉双臂站在他们面前。“我不喜欢被打扰，年轻人。”
The agent placed his index finger on his weapon's trigger. "Final warning. Move away from the Children!"
特工将食指放在武器的扳机上，说道：“最后警告，远离孩子们！”
Bwynvienne's response was to simply keep staring at them.
布温维恩的回应仅仅是继续盯着他们看。
"Open fire!"
开火！
The leftmost man's eyes widened and he lowered his weapon as he turned to the tall agent. "Wait, you idio-"
最左边的人眼睛瞪大，放下武器转向高个子特工，“等等，你这个蠢——”
Five shots rang out through the apartment. Bwynvienne's hand flashed out as Shinji and Asuka dived to the ground. The agent that Shinji had recognised snatched the pistol from the tall man's hands, setting the safety on it before putting it in his own holster.
五声枪响在公寓中回荡。Bwynvienne 的手迅速伸出，而 Shinji 和 Asuka 则扑倒在地。Shinji 认出的那位特工从高个子男人手中夺过手枪，将其调至安全状态后放入自己的枪套。
"You're a goddamn moron, Yoshida!" he snarled before turning to the third agent. "You and Kojiro! Negligent discharges!" Kojiro bowed his head in shame.
"你这个该死的蠢货，吉田！"他咆哮着转向第三位特工。"你和儿玉！疏忽走火！"儿玉羞愧地低下了头。
The two teenagers slowly got to their feet as the man harangued his fellow agents. As Asuka stood up straight, Shinji saw that her head was directly in line with Bwynvienne's right hand, still clenched and held out to her side, and he paled. His reaction was swiftly mirrored by the girl as she noticed just how close she had come to death.
两个少年缓缓站起身来，此时那名男子正在训斥他的同僚。当明日香挺直腰杆时，真嗣看到她的头正好与布温维涅的右手齐平，那只手依然紧握着，伸向她的一侧，他顿时脸色苍白。女孩随即也注意到了自己离死亡有多近，她的反应与真嗣如出一辙。
A cellphone rang, shattering the awkward silence in a manner similar to the gunshots. The angry Section Two agent brought out his phone and answered it, quickly moving it away from his ear as somebody screamed into it. He glanced at the other two men and motioned for them to leave. Yoshida seemed about to argue, but he kept his mouth shut as the three exited the lounge room. A moment later, Shinji could just barely hear a familiar voice chewing them out in the kitchen.
一阵手机铃声响起，打破了尴尬的沉默，其效果与枪声相似。愤怒的第二部门特工掏出手机接听，迅速将手机从耳边移开，因为有人对着电话尖叫。他瞥了另外两人一眼，示意他们离开。吉田似乎想要争辩，但还是闭上了嘴，三人随即离开了休息室。片刻后，真嗣隐约听到厨房里传来一个熟悉的声音在训斥他们。
Bwynvienne disgustedly said a word Shinji couldn't understand but knew to be a curse, before finally unclenching her hands. Several objects dropped to the ground; bullets, just as he expected. What was unexpected was the shape of them: five perfectly flat discs about half a centimetre thick. He stared at the woman in awe and just a little fear.
布温维尼厌恶地说了一个真嗣听不懂但知道是诅咒的词，然后终于松开了双手。几样东西掉落在地；正如他所料，是子弹。出乎意料的是它们的形状：五枚半厘米厚的完美扁平圆盘。他带着敬畏和一丝恐惧凝视着这位女子。
Here was a woman with burning hair, eyes that seemed to bore into his skull, who could catch bullets out of the air, and was likely immune to small-arms fire. And yet she had the appearance and demeanour of a mostly-friendly middle management office worker.
眼前这位女子，头发如火焰般燃烧，眼神似乎能穿透他的头骨，能从空中抓住子弹，很可能对轻武器射击免疫。然而，她的外表和举止却像是一个大体友好的中层管理办公室职员。
"Now then," she said, turning back to the teenagers as her cheery attitude resumed. "Again, I apologise. You'll simply have to find some other way to deal with your situation."
那么，" 她转回身对青少年们说，恢复了愉快的态度，"再次道歉。你们只能另想办法解决你们的问题了。
"Maybe Doctor Akagi will work something out," Shinji mused. "She's the head of the science team after all."
或许赤木博士会有办法，" 碇真嗣沉思道，"毕竟她是科学团队的负责人。
"Hmm." Asuka folded her arms, apparently deep in thought as a finger began tapping on her arm. She looked up at Bwynvienne. "Can I ask you something?"
嗯。" 明日香双臂交叉，似乎陷入了沉思，手指开始轻敲手臂。她抬头看向布温维恩。"我能问你个问题吗？
"You just did, but I'll let you have another one."
你已经问了，不过我允许你再问一个。
Asuka faltered for a second, before plowing on. "If soul contracts actually work, meaning they can be given and taken, why aren't we seeing people gaining immense wealth and power?"
明日香犹豫了一下，然后继续说道：“如果灵魂契约真的有效，意味着它们可以被给予和接受，那为什么我们看不到人们因此获得巨大的财富和权力呢？”
"Simple." The Infernal woman grinned. "Soul contracts can only happen like yours did, with both people receiving something. And a human can't simply give and take 'power' like you're thinking. Only Infernals can transfer power, and even then only to another Infernal. Wealth on the other hand... well, there's plenty of ways to get rich."
“很简单。”那位地狱女子咧嘴一笑，“灵魂契约只能像你的情况那样发生，即双方都能得到一些东西。而且人类不能像你想象的那样简单地给予和夺取‘权力’。只有地狱生物才能转移力量，即便如此，也只能转移给另一个地狱生物。至于财富嘛……嗯，有很多方法可以致富。”
"I'm pretty sure most people don't really believe in souls anyway, so they wouldn't bother with a contract," said Shinji. "And those that do wouldn't want to give theirs up."
我敢肯定，大多数人其实并不真的相信灵魂的存在，所以他们不会费心去签订什么契约，" 真嗣说道。"而那些确实相信的人，也不会愿意放弃自己的灵魂。
"I suppose," replied Asuka. "But still, by now there should have been at least one person." She waved a hand at the contract on the table. "I just found that on the internet after all."
我想也是，" 明日香回答道。"但即便如此，到现在应该至少有一个人签过吧。" 她挥手示意桌上的契约。"毕竟，我就是在网上找到的这个东西。
"I... suppose I should reveal something," said Bwynvienne, starting to look somewhat sheepish. "This contract you signed, it shouldn't even be on your internet. It's supposed to only be used by Infernals, and only in a certain situation."
我...我想我应该透露一些事情，" Bwynvienne 说道，开始显得有些尴尬。"你们签的这份合同，它根本不应该出现在你们的互联网上。它本应仅供恶魔使用，并且只在特定情况下使用。
Asuka looked down at the contract, then back up at Bwynvienne. She narrowed her eyes. "What kind of situation?"
明日香低头看着合同，然后抬头看向布温维恩。她眯起了眼睛。“什么样的局面？”
"Think about it. How did you learn about the contract?"
“想想看，你是怎么得知这份合同的？”
"A girl told their boyfriend to sign it," replied Shinji. "Asuka watched it happen."
一个女孩告诉她的男朋友签字，"真嗣回答道，"明日香目睹了这一切。
"Yes. While that was slightly different to how we Infernals do it, the basic principle is still the same."
是的。虽然这与我们 Infernals 的做法略有不同，但基本原则仍然相同。
"What principle?!" Asuka stomped her foot petulantly. "Stop beating around the bush!"
什么原则？！" 明日香不耐烦地跺了跺脚。"别拐弯抹角了！
"Start using your brain, young lady," Bwynvienne shot back. "Giving their soul, and getting something in return. Sometimes power, sometimes wealth or status; or simply companionship."
动动脑子，小姑娘，" 布温维尼反驳道。"付出灵魂，换取回报。有时是力量，有时是财富或地位；或者仅仅是陪伴。
Companionship. Things began to come together in Shinji's mind. "Wait a minute," he slowly said. He had a feeling he was going to regret what he was about to say. Or rather, Asuka would make him regret it. But it needed to be said. "It's a marriage thing, isn't it?"
陪伴。事情开始在真嗣的脑海中汇聚。“等一下，”他缓缓地说。他有种预感，自己即将说出的话会让他后悔。或者更确切地说，明日香会让他后悔。但这句话必须说出来。“这是关于婚姻的事，对吧？”
"Oh well done!" Bwynvienne clapped her hands, a smile painted on her face.
“哦，做得好！”布温维恩拍手称赞，脸上洋溢着笑容。
"W-w-w-what?!" Asuka shrieked. "You mean I'm m-m-married to this idiot?!"
什、什、什、什么?!" 明日香尖叫道，"你的意思是我要和这个白痴结婚?!
That... stung. While Shinji had known Asuka for a long time, considering how they had communicated to each other for most of their lives he wasn't sure if she considered him a best friend, let alone anything more. He hadn't even begun to think of anybody in a romantic way, but he wasn't closed off to the idea. But hearing Asuka's voice practically dripping with disgust while saying what she just said, though... it hurt.
那句话...刺痛了他。尽管真嗣和明日香相识已久，考虑到他们一生中大部分时间都是这样交流的，他不确定她是否把他当作最好的朋友，更不用说其他了。他甚至还没有开始以浪漫的方式考虑任何人，但他并不排斥这个想法。但是听到明日香刚才那句话中几乎滴着厌恶的声音...真的很伤人。
And it seemed to show on his face.
而这一切似乎都写在了他的脸上。
"Oh shit. Um..." Asuka was clearly trying to backpedal, to ease the pain of what she had just blurted out. "S-sorry Shinji, I didn't mean it like that! You're a nice enough person, you know, and we've known each other for a long time and such... I was just shocked at the fact that we're apparently married! I've never even thought about such a thing and we're fighting a war against Angels and there's more important things to think about and-"
哦，糟糕。呃..." 明日香显然在试图挽回，以减轻她刚刚脱口而出的话带来的痛苦。"对...对不起，真嗣，我不是那个意思！你知道的，你是个不错的人，而且我们认识很久了，诸如此类...我只是对我们竟然结婚了这一事实感到震惊！我从未想过这样的事，我们还在与使徒作战，还有更重要的事情要考虑，还有——
"I'm going to stop you right there," Bwynvienne interjected, raising a hand. "Let me explain a bit. There's a lot more to an Infernal proposal than just signing a contract. The contract is an ancient tradition that's somehow held strong in our society for millennia. It involves a lot of formality and ritual proceedings like getting the parents' approval, a very specific dance, some dangerous tasks, and so on. The contract signing is just what happens at the end of it, and seals the deal, so to speak."
我得打断你一下，" Bwynvienne 插话说，举起一只手。"让我稍微解释一下。签订地狱契约远不止是签个合同那么简单。这个合同是我们社会中一种古老的传统，不知何故在数千年间一直保持着强大的影响力。它涉及到许多正式和仪式性的程序，比如获得父母的同意、一种特定的舞蹈、一些危险的任务等等。合同签署只是这一系列过程的最后一步，可以说是最终的确认。
"So... we're not married?" Asuka asked, a hint of hope in her voice.
"那么...我们还没结婚吗？" 明日香问道，声音中带着一丝希望。
Bwynvienne hummed, her head tilting back and forth as she thought. "The answer you're looking for is 'no'. You're humans, and not in the Lower Planes. Sure, if you came to the Lower Planes and people saw the contract, they might ask when the wedding is, but that's not likely to happen. Right now, in your situation, the contract is nothing more than a trade agreement that involves a soul."
布温维妮哼着小曲，脑袋左右摇摆，陷入沉思。“你寻求的答案是‘不’。你们是人类，并非身处下界。当然，如果你们来到下界，人们看到这份契约，或许会问婚礼何时举行，但这不太可能发生。眼下，在你们的情况下，这份契约不过是涉及灵魂的贸易协议罢了。”
"...You thought about that when you first saw the contract, didn't you?" It wasn't really a question. Now that Shinji understood what the contract meant, he was able to work out what Bwynvienne had been smiling about earlier.
“...你初次见到契约时，就想到了这一点，对吧？”这其实并非真正的问题。现在，真嗣明白了契约的含义，他也能理解布温维妮之前为何微笑了。
Bwynvienne blinked at him, then turned to Asuka. "Sure you don't want to marry him? He's pretty smart. Not bad looking either, but then I can't really judge a human's appearance."
布温维尼眨了眨眼，然后转向明日香。“你确定不想嫁给他吗？他挺聪明的。长得也不赖，不过我对人类的相貌实在没什么判断力。”
"Can we stop talking about marriage now?!" The Second Child was starting to turn as red as her hair, and Shinji's own faces was heating up too.
"我们现在能不谈结婚的事了吗？！" 二号机驾驶员的脸开始变得和她的头发一样红，而真嗣的脸也热了起来。
"Very well. I believe I've overstayed my welcome, if those gentlemen are anything to go by," said Bwynvienne, hooking a thumb over her shoulder. "I do apologise for not being able to assist in your case, but there is nothing that can be done at this point in time. If you'd like, I can come back when your contract dissolves to help arbitrate a solution."
非常好。我相信我已经待得太久了，如果那些先生们有什么表示的话，" 布温维涅说，用拇指指了指肩膀后面。"对于未能在此案中提供帮助，我深表歉意，但目前确实无能为力。如果您愿意，我可以在您的合同解除时回来，帮助调解解决方案。
"If we're even freaking alive at that point, then sure," Asuka darkly muttered.
"如果我们那时还活着的话，当然可以，" 明日香阴沉地嘟囔道。
"Well then." Bwynvienne bowed deeply before the two of them, and Shinji forced his eyes away from the woman's... chest. "Farewell to the both of you, and I do hope to see you again in five years time."
那么，" 布温维尼深深地向两人鞠了一躬，而真嗣则强迫自己将目光从这位女士的……胸前移开。"再见了，两位，希望五年后能再次见到你们。
Shinji blinked... and Bwynvienne disappeared. There was no flash, nothing to suggest she had teleported or anything. She was simply gone.
真嗣眨了眨眼……布温维尼就消失了。没有闪光，没有任何迹象表明她进行了传送或任何类似的事情。她就那样凭空消失了。
There was a nervous cough from the lounge room entrance. Shinji and Asuka both looked over to see Kojiro standing there.
客厅入口处传来一阵紧张的咳嗽声。真嗣和明日香都转头看去，只见小次郎站在那里。
"Captain Katsuragi has requested your presence at NERV headquarters," he said after clearly looking around for Bwynvienne and seeing nothing. "Please come with us."
葛城上尉要求您前往 NERV 总部，"他在明显地环顾四周寻找 Bwynvienne 却一无所获后说道，"请跟我们来。
XXX
It was two hours after the incident at the pilot's apartment. The MAGI had detected a Pattern Orange there, but despite the Second and Third Children clearly talking to somebody, there was apparently nothing besides them in the room according to the security camera that had been installed in their lounge room before they had moved in. Section Two had been scrambled, and had very nearly accidentally killed the Second Child. Yoshida had been fired on the spot, while Kojiro had 'merely' had to deal with being put on probation.
事故发生在飞行员公寓两小时后。MAGI 在那里检测到了橙色模式，但尽管第二和第三适格者明显在与人交谈，根据安装在他们搬入前的客厅里的监控摄像头显示，房间里除了他们之外似乎什么也没有。第二部门被紧急召集，差点误杀了第二适格者。吉田当场被解雇，而小次郎则只是面临了缓刑的处罚。
And an irate Misato.
还有愤怒的葛城。
Two hours later and the captain was still angry about it; perhaps wishing that Yoshida could have been fired in a more literal sense. An artillery battery had been mentioned.
两小时后，船长对此依然怒气未消；或许他希望吉田能以更字面的方式被“解雇”。有人提到了炮兵连。
Shinji and Asuka had been rushed to NERV Headquarters, where they had had to sit through what amounted to an interrogation. Since the security camera had somehow been unable to pick up Bwynvienne, the two pilots had to try and recreate her side of the conversation. Fortunately, Asuka's memory was better than Shinji's.
真嗣和明日香被紧急送往 NERV 总部，在那里他们不得不接受一场近乎审讯的盘问。由于监控摄像头不知何故未能捕捉到布温维恩的身影，两位驾驶员不得不尝试重现她那边的对话。幸运的是，明日香的记忆力比真嗣要好。
"Can we please go now?" Asuka tiredly begged as she dramatically collapsed forward on to the table in the briefing room.
"我们现在可以走了吗？" 明日香疲惫地恳求着，夸张地向前倒在简报室的桌子上。
"Soon," Misato promised. "Section Two is almost done checking your apartment."
快了，" 美里承诺道，"第二部门快检查完你的公寓了。
"Why?" Shinji wondered. "Nothing happened there besides us talking to Miss Bwynvienne."
为什么？" 真嗣感到疑惑。"那里除了我们和布温维涅小姐交谈之外，什么也没发生。
"It's just a precaution."
这只是预防措施。
"Well they'd better not be slipping any more cameras in, especially in my bedroom," said Asuka, not bothering to lift her head up. "Bad enough that you're spying on us, I don't want to have to worry about perverts too."
好吧，他们最好不要再偷偷安装更多摄像头了，尤其是在我的卧室里，" 明日香说，头也不抬。"你们监视我们已经够糟糕的了，我不想还得担心变态。
"They're not sneaking cameras into your bedrooms," Misato exasperatedly replied. "Give us some credit. Besides, you two are crucial NERV assets. We need to keep eyes on you. Why do you think there's always a Section Two detail somewhere near you?"
他们没有在你的卧室里偷偷安装摄像头，" 美里无奈地回答。"给我们一点信任吧。再说，你们俩是 NERV 的重要资产。我们需要时刻关注你们。你以为为什么总有一队第二部门的人在你们附近？
Asuka shifted her head slightly so she could stare at her guardian. "If we're so important, can we get paid more?" Misato just stared back at her until she shrugged as best as she could and said, "Well, it was worth a shot."
明日香微微侧头，以便凝视她的监护人。“既然我们这么重要，能不能多给点报酬？”美里只是回望着她，直到她尽可能地耸了耸肩，说道：“好吧，试试也无妨。”
Shinji spoke up. "Would this be enough to prove to people that Asuka does have my soul?"
真嗣开口说道：“这足以向人们证明，明日香确实拥有我的灵魂吗？”
Misato opened her mouth, then closed it and thought for a few seconds. "Look, at this point I already believe you. Convincing Ritsuko on the other hand... I think only she herself would be able to do that. The moment everything settled down she left to look into the incident in her own way." She gave an encouraging smile. "Call me optimistic though. I think it'll just be a matter of time before she finds something science-y to prove it."
碇真嗣张开嘴，又闭上，思考了几秒钟。“听着，到这个地步我已经相信你了。但要说服律子……我觉得只有她自己能做到。一切平息后，她就离开去用自己的方式调查这件事了。”她露出了鼓励的微笑。“尽管叫我乐观主义者吧。我相信她很快就能找到科学证据来证明这一点。”
Asuka pushed herself up off the table so she was sitting properly again. "So is that it? Are we just going to sit around doing nothing until those black-suited morons finish messing up our apartment?"
明日香从桌子上撑起身子，重新坐正。“就这样吗？我们就这样干坐着，直到那些穿黑西装的蠢货把我们的公寓搞得一团糟？”
"You don't have to stay here, but you can't go home." Misato paused, before giving a small chuckle at what she just said. "Go get some food or something. I'll come get you when we can leave."
你不必留在这里，但也不能回家。" 碇真嗣停顿了一下，然后对自己刚才的话轻声笑了起来。"去弄点吃的吧，等能走了我会来接你。
Getting to her feet, Asuka said, "That's all I need to hear. Come on, Shinji. I'm feeling a little peckish."
站起来后，明日香说："这就够了。走吧，真嗣，我有点饿了。"
XXX
"I'm no longer feeling peckish."
我不再感到饿了。
Shinji stared at the two large empty ice-cream bowls on the table in front of Asuka. "I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that."
真嗣盯着桌子上明日香面前的两个大空冰淇淋碗。"我相信这背后一定有合理的解释。"
"Smart-ass," Asuka shot back, before stifling a burp. "Oogh, I've had worse, but I've also had better. Sure you don't want anything?"
机灵鬼，" 明日香反驳道，随后抑制住了一个嗝。"呃，我吃过更糟的，也吃过更好的。你确定不要点什么吗？
He shook his head before resting his chin on his hand. "I'm not hungry right now," he replied before gazing out across the mess hall. This late at night, the two teenagers were the only people there. The chef on duty had quickly wiped an annoyed look off his face when Asuka had simply asked for some dessert. The ice-cream had been produced, Asuka had walked off happily, and the chef had returned to reading his book somewhere in the kitchen.
他摇了摇头，然后将下巴搁在手上。"我现在不饿，"他回答后，目光扫过食堂。深夜时分，这两个少年是那里仅有的人。值班的厨师在明日香只要求甜点时，迅速收起了不悦的表情。冰淇淋被端了出来，明日香满意地离开，而厨师则回到厨房继续读他的书。
Asuka must have caught his expression, because she leaned into his view. "You okay?"
明日香一定是捕捉到了他的表情，因为她侧身进入了他的视线。“你还好吗？”
"Hmm?" Shinji turned back to her. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just wondering what they're going to do with me. There's no point in me being here if I can't fight. I'm pretty sure they'd send out Ayanami while she's still injured before they'd send me."
嗯？" 真嗣转头看向她。"嗯，我没事。只是想知道他们打算怎么安排我。如果我不能战斗，留在这里也没有意义。我敢肯定，他们宁愿让受伤的绫波出战，也不会派我上场。
"You mean the First Child? I'd heard she was hurt, but just how bad is it?"
你是指第一适格者吗？我听说她受伤了，但到底有多严重？
Shinji sighed as he recalled the incident in Unit-01's cage. "I don't know the details myself, but they had to wheel her out on a gurney. Bandages all over her, including an eyepatch and a cast on her arm."
真嗣叹了口气，回忆起在零号机笼中的那次事件。“我自己也不清楚具体情况，但他们不得不用担架把她抬出去。全身都是绷带，包括一个眼罩和手臂上的石膏。”
Asuka's voice lowered to a dangerous tone. "What. The fuck?! They were going to make someone fight in an Eva in that condition?!"
明日香的语气降低到了危险的音调。“什么鬼？！他们竟然要让某人在那种状态下驾驶 Eva？！”
"Probably," replied Shinji. "I'd just said that there was no way I could pilot after, you know, literally only just finding out that Evas existed. My... father decided I was useless and told somebody to bring Ayanami out."
可能吧，" 回应的是真嗣。"我刚说过，在刚刚得知 Eva 存在后，我根本无法驾驶。我的...父亲认为我没用，就让人把绫波带出来了。
Asuka blinked at him. "It was blackmail," she growled.
明日香眨了眨眼，盯着他。“这是敲诈，”她咆哮道。
"What?"
什么？
"Blackmail. If the First Child was really in that kind of condition, there's no way she could have put up a fight against the Third Angel. She was trotted out in front of you deliberately." Asuka began speaking deeply, mimicking a male voice. "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji. Or we'll send this cripple out to die."
敲诈。倘若第一适格者果真如此虚弱，她绝无可能与第三使徒一战。她是被刻意推到你面前的。" 明日香模仿着男性的嗓音，语气沉重。"真嗣，快进机器人里去。不然我们就把这个废人推出去送死。

"Well it worked," Shinji bitterly said, eyes looking into the past. "When she was wheeled out I moved towards her to see what was going on. Something happened on the surface and the cage shook violently enough to knock us off our feet. I just made it in time to catch Ayanami when she fell off the gurney." Shinji stared down at his hands. "She was still bleeding. Some of it got on me, and she was clearly in pain." His hands clenched into fists. "I just couldn't let her go out instead of me."
确实，它奏效了，" 真嗣苦涩地说，目光投向过往。"她被推出时，我上前查看情况。突然，地面发生异动，笼子猛烈摇晃，我们都被甩倒在地。我及时赶到，接住了从担架上跌落的绫波。" 真嗣低头凝视双手。"她仍在流血，血迹沾染了我，她显然痛苦不堪。" 他的双手紧握成拳。"我实在无法让她替我赴险。

He got an appraising look from Asuka. "So you took her place anyway."
明日香用审视的眼神看了他一眼，说："看来你终究还是顶替了她。"

"I wouldn't let her get hurt again just because I was being stubborn. So I got in the robot." He leaned back in his chair and threw up a hand in exasperation. "And then I went out and got my butt kicked. What a wonderful start to my NERV career," he finished with a groan.
"我不想因为自己的固执让她再次受伤，于是我登上了机器人。"他靠在椅背上，无奈地挥了挥手。"结果一出去就被打得落花流水。这真是我加入 NERV 的精彩开局，"他带着呻吟结束了这番话。

"Yeah, I saw the footage," Asuka mirthfully replied, which made Shinji groan again; this time from embarrassment. "You moved with all the grace of a broken telephone pole." She held an arm upright, then slowly brought it down to horizontal, letting out a descending whistle that ended as her hand slapped the table.
"没错，我看了那段视频，" 明日香笑着回应，令真嗣再次尴尬地呻吟。"你的动作真是优雅，就像一根断了的电线杆。" 她举起手臂，缓缓放平，伴随着一声逐渐降低的口哨，最后手掌重重地拍在桌上。

Shinji covered his face with his hands. "Not my finest moment," he mumbled.
真嗣双手掩面，低声道：“这可不是我光彩的一刻。”

"Good news and good news, you two!" came a familiar voice from the mess hall door.
"好消息连连，你们俩有福了！"食堂门口传来一个熟悉的声音。

The two teenagers turned to look. Misato was headed towards them, weaving through the mess hall at a fast pace before coming to a stop at their table.
两位少年回头一看，只见碇真嗣正疾步穿梭于食堂中，迅速来到他们桌前停住。

"I just got word from Section Two," she said. "We can go home whenever we want."
她刚收到第二部门的通知，说我们可以随时回家。

"Finally!" Asuka cheered, raising her hands to the heavens.
"终于到了！" 明日香兴奋地高举双手，仿佛要触摸天空。

"What's the other bit of good news?" asked Shinji.
新二问道：'还有什么其他的好消息吗？'

"I asked Ritsuko about Rei," replied Misato. "She said the First Child should be out of hospital next week."
我向律子询问了绫波的情况，" 三佐回应说，"她提到第一适格者预计下周可以出院。

Raising an eyebrow in confusion, Shinji said, "Huh? Already? She looked half-dead when I last saw her."
真嗣疑惑地挑眉道：“什么？已经？我上次见她时，她一副奄奄一息的样子。”

"Weelllll..." Misato waggled a hand in a so-so gesture. "She'll be out of the hospital, yeah, but she won't be fully recovered for a little while longer. Broken bones take time, you know."
嗯……" 葛城美里摆了摆手，示意情况一般，"她会出院的，不过要完全康复还得再等些日子。骨折嘛，恢复起来总得慢慢来。

"Ah, that makes more sense."
哦，这样解释就清楚多了。

"Speaking of which, I forgot to say this earlier. Good work on catching Ayanami when she fell off the gurney. The doctors said the landing might have aggravated her injuries even more. Maybe even re-broken her arm."
对了，差点忘了提，你及时接住从担架上跌落的绫波，做得很好。医生表示，若她直接摔落，可能会加剧伤情，甚至导致手臂再次骨折。

"Wow, what a hero," Asuka remarked in a deadpan tone. "I sure hope you'll come to my aid like that."
哇，真是英雄呢，" 明日香面无表情地说，"真希望你也能那样来帮我。

"Of course I will," Shinji immediately replied, an honest tone of frankness in his words as he regarded the words of his friend with an odd look. "Why wouldn't I?"
我当然会," 真嗣立刻回答, 语气坦诚, 他带着一丝奇怪的表情看着朋友的话。"我怎么会拒绝呢?

Asuka began to blush at his sincerity and she quickly looked away. "Oh. Um..."
明日香被他的真诚打动，脸上泛起红晕，急忙将目光移开。"哦，呃..."

Misato glanced between the two of them and put a hand over her mouth to stifle a giggle. "Alright, enough flirting you two. Let's head home."
美里来回打量着两人，用手掩口，强忍笑意。“行了，别再眉来眼去了，咱们回家吧。”

"Flirting?! With him?!" 跟他调情？！

"I-I wasn't flirting!" 我-我真没在调情！

Their guardian laughed all the way home.
他们的保护者一路笑着回到家。

### Chapter 05 What Are You?
你是谁？
True to Misato's words, Rei Ayanami ended up being discharged from hospital only three days later, as Shinji discovered when the mysterious girl was suddenly in Class 2-A one morning. She didn't look up as Shinji and Asuka entered, instead focusing all of her attention on something beyond the window she was sitting next to. There was still a cast on her right arm and a surgical patch over her left eye; Shinji struggled to think of what could have happened to cause such injuries.
正如葛城美里所言，绫波丽在三天后便出院了，这是真嗣在某个早晨发现神秘女孩突然出现在 2-A 班时得知的。她并未抬头看真嗣和明日香进来，而是全神贯注地凝视着她所坐窗外的某处。她的右臂仍打着石膏，左眼上贴着手术补丁；真嗣努力思索着究竟发生了什么，才会导致这样的伤势。
He was about to go and greet her, but Class Representative Horaki was suddenly right beside him, ordering everyone to their seats as the teacher entered. Roll was called, and the teacher seemed astonished when Ayanami answered, still staring out the window, but the man covered his surprise with a short cough and continued. The first lesson period soon began, and Shinji almost fell asleep right away as another lecture about life before Second Impact began. Then again that might have been because of how little sleep he got.
他正要上前打招呼，班长洞木光突然出现在他身边，催促大家就座，因为老师已经进来了。点名开始了，当绫波丽依旧望着窗外回答时，老师显得很惊讶，但他用一声短咳掩饰了惊讶，继续点名。第一节课很快开始，真嗣几乎立刻就打起了瞌睡，又是一堂关于第二次冲击前生活的讲座。或许这也与他睡眠不足有关。
Last night, Asuka had insisted that they both go through their bedrooms to ensure that nothing had been touched. She clearly didn't trust Section Two at all, and Shinji couldn't blame her since one of them had almost ventilated her skull. He had tried to assert that NERV had no need to pry into their sleeping habits, but Asuka had, after checking her room, come into his to make sure no listening devices or hidden cameras had been planted. He rather doubted that the suspicious redhead would have found anything even if Section Two had bugged the place. An organisation like NERV weren't going to be obvious with something like that.
昨晚，明日香坚持两人都要检查各自的卧室，确保没有被动过任何东西。她显然完全不信任第二部门，而真嗣也无法责怪她，毕竟其中一人差点就让她脑袋开花。他曾试图强调 NERV 无需窥探他们的睡眠习惯，但明日香在检查完自己的房间后，还是来到他的房间，确保没有安装窃听器或隐藏摄像头。他相当怀疑，即使第二部门真的在这里安装了监控，这位多疑的红发少女也未必能发现什么。像 NERV 这样的组织，在这类事情上绝不会明目张胆。

She had left in rather a hurry after opening the drawers in his bedside table, which puzzled Shinji until he realised just what items of clothing were in them. Asuka's face had been starting to turn red, now that he thought of it.
她匆匆离去，打开他床头柜的抽屉后，真嗣起初不解，直到发现抽屉里的衣物，才恍然大悟。此刻回想，明日香的脸颊似乎已开始泛红。

A soft chime reached his ears, startling Shinji enough that his chin suddenly slipped off his hand, but he caught himself before his head could impact the desk. Around him, people were either sleeping, doing late homework, or chatting on their laptops. Even the class representative didn't seem to be paying much attention to the teacher.
柔和的铃声传入耳中，惊得真嗣下巴突然从手上滑落，好在头撞到桌子前他及时稳住了。周围的人有的在睡觉，有的赶着做作业，还有的在笔记本电脑上聊天。就连班长似乎也没怎么注意老师。
Laptop. His had been the one to make that sound, so he opened it up and noticed a message alert. The name attached to the alert made him frown in confusion, before looking ahead of him at Asuka, who stared right back at him in the reflection of the screen before raising an eyebrow and pointedly looking down at her keyboard. Shinji exhaled slowly in quiet exasperation. Chances were that the teacher wouldn't notice them whispering to each other, but evidently Asuka wanted to make sure.
笔记本电脑发出声响，是他那台。他打开一看，发现了一条消息提醒。看到提醒上的名字，他困惑地皱起眉头，随即抬头望向前方的明日香。屏幕反射中，她正直勾勾地回望着他，然后挑了挑眉，故意低头看向自己的键盘。真嗣无奈地缓缓呼出一口气。虽然老师未必会注意到他们低声交谈，但显然明日香想要确保万无一失。
Soryu_A: Is this all that old geezer at the front talks about during this lesson? Isn't this lesson supposed to be Algebra?
绫波：这节课上，前面那个老头子就只讲这些吗？这节课不是应该讲代数吗？
Ikari_S: Apparently it is. I asked Aida about it yesterday, and he said this teacher's almost famous for it. But since he's been at this school for a very long time, the people in charge don't want to let him go. Especially when people are leaving the city for safer pastures.
Ikari_S: 看来是的。我昨天问了 Aida，他说这位老师几乎因此出名了。但由于他在这所学校待了很久，负责人并不想让他离开。尤其是在人们纷纷离开这座城市去寻找更安全的地方时。
Asuka's response was three horizontal lines; two hyphens with an underscore in the middle. Shinji stared at it for a moment before realisation set in; it was an emoticon, signifying how she felt about that.
明日香的回复是三条横线：两个短横中间夹一个下划线。真嗣盯着它看了一会儿，才恍然大悟；这是一个表情符号，代表了她对此的感受。
Ikari_S: If it helps, you could pretend this is a free period. You do have a college degree, if what Misato said before our first day is true.
Ikari_S: 如果这能有所帮助，你可以假装这是一段自由时间。如果你第一天前 Misato 所说的你有大学学位是真的。
Soryu_A: I don't have a college degree.
Soryu_A：我没有大学学位。
Ikari_S: Wait, I'm positive s
等等，我确定是 s
Shinji stopped typing as another message beat him to the punch.
真嗣停下了打字，另一条消息抢先了一步。
Soryu_A: I have TWO degrees.
惣流·A：我拥有两个学位。
Delete delete.
删除删除。
Ikari_S: Oh. Um.
伊卡里_S：哦。呃。
Ikari_S: Wow. That's amazing. What are they?
伊卡里_S：哇，太神奇了，那是什么？
He could almost hear the smug grin on the face in front of him.
他几乎能听到面前那张脸上得意的笑容。
Soryu_A: Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics. I could go and create a new type of armour for the Evas right now if I wanted to. If I weren't stuck in this damn class listening to someone drone on about food prices twenty years ago.
惣流_A：机械工程与数学。如果我愿意，我现在就可以去创造一种新型 EVA 装甲。如果不是被困在这个该死的课堂上听某人喋喋不休地谈论二十年前的食品价格。
Ikari_S: TYPE of armour?
碇_S：新型装甲？
Soryu_A: Yeah, the Evas have utility armour for situations like fighting underwater. I don't know if that'll actually happen, though.
碇真嗣哼了一声表示理解，声音刚好能让明日香听到。眼下似乎没什么可说的了，于是他合上笔记本电脑，再次用手撑着下巴，目光漫无目的地在房间里游走……最终落在了绫波丽的后脑勺上。
Shinji hummed in understanding, just loud enough that Asuka would hear him. There didn't appear to be anything more to say for the time being, so he closed his laptop and returned to leaning his chin on his hand as his eyes idly roamed around the room... before landing on the back of Ayanami's head.
明日香 A：是啊，EVA 有用于水下战斗的实用装甲。不过，这种情况会不会真的发生，我就不知道了。
He wasn't even sure if she had moved an inch the entire morning. Her head was resting on her hand, and she was still staring out the window to her left. Shinji blinked as he realised he was copying her posture almost exactly, thought about shifting to a different one, then his chin slipped again as he got another message alert.
他甚至不确定她整个上午是否动过一寸。她的头靠在手上，依旧凝视着左边的窗外。意识到自己几乎在模仿她的姿势，真嗣眨了眨眼，考虑换个姿势，但下巴又滑了下来，因为收到了另一条消息提醒。
Soryu_A: What the hell are you staring at so intently?
Soryu_A: 你到底在盯着什么看得这么入神？
Shinji blushed slightly, thankful that Asuka couldn't properly see his face. He considered making something up, but quickly decided it would be better to just tell the truth.
真嗣微微脸红，庆幸明日香无法清楚地看到他的脸。他考虑编个故事，但很快决定还是说实话更好。
Ikari_S: It's... Ayanami. She hasn't done anything at all since we got here besides look outside. There's not even a book in front of her or anything.
Ikari_S: 是……绫波。自从我们到这里以来，她除了望向窗外什么也没做。她面前甚至连一本书或任何东西都没有。
Soryu_A: Oh, so that's the First Child? I thought it was just some weirdo who dyed their hair. Anyway, it's none of your business if she doesn't want to learn about old fuel prices.
惣流·A：哦，原来那就是第一适格者啊？我还以为是个染了头发的怪人呢。总之，如果她不想了解过去的燃料价格，那也不关你的事。
Ikari_S: No, I mean
碇·S：不，我的意思是
Ikari_S: Is she alright? She was in critical condition not that long ago, and suddenly she's here.
Ikari_S: 她还好吗？不久前她还处于危急状态，突然间她就在这里了。
Soryu_A: Maybe she's studying how to be a tree. Maybe she hit her head as well. Maybe she's one step away from a vegetable.
Soryu_A: 或许她在学习如何成为一棵树。或许她也撞到了头。或许她离变成植物只差一步了。
Ikari_S: Asuka.
碇真嗣：明日香。
Soryu_A: What?
惣流：什么？
Shinji sighed and began tapping a finger on the edge of his laptop as he tried to formulate a response. Asuka ended up beating him to the punch.
真嗣叹了口气，开始用手指轻敲笔记本电脑边缘，试图构思回复。结果明日香抢先一步。
Soryu_A: You wanna go talk to her at lunch? Introduce yourself properly or something while not very subtly seeing if she's okay?
惣流 A：你想在午餐时去找她谈谈吗？正式地介绍自己，或者在不那么隐晦地看看她是否还好？
Ikari_S: I guess. What about you though?
Ikari_S: 我想也是。那你呢？
Soryu_A: I may as well come along, wouldn't hurt to meet a fellow pilot.
Soryu_A: 我也一起去吧，认识一下其他飞行员也无妨。
A quick glance at the clock at the front of the class told Shinji just how long they'd have to wait.
教室前方的时钟一瞥，让真嗣清楚他们还得等多久。
Ikari_S: Just half an hour before lunch.
Ikari_S: 离午饭还有半小时。
Soryu_A: Oh just kill me now...
惣流_A：哦，现在就杀了我吧...
XXX
Shinji had to shield his eyes as he stepped out of the school building into the hot midday sun. Not surprisingly, it seemed as if most of the students were staying inside for the lunch period. He would have preferred to do the same, but questioning Aida had revealed that Rei always went outside during lunch unless it was raining. And even then she only occasionally stayed inside.
真嗣走出校舍，踏入正午炙热的阳光中，不得不遮住眼睛。不出所料，午餐时间大多数学生似乎都选择留在室内。他本也想如此，但询问相田后得知，除非下雨，绫波总是会在午餐时外出。即便下雨，她也只是偶尔留在室内。
"Guess she's not some kind of albino then," Asuka had immediately remarked, to which Shinji had given her a disapproving look. "What? If that hair colour is natural, then there must be something going on with her."
看来她并不是什么白化病患者，" 明日香立刻评论道，对此真嗣给了她一个不赞同的眼神。"怎么了？如果那发色是天生的，那她肯定有些特别之处。
Now they were both outside, looking for that tell-tale mop of blue hair. It took several minutes before Asuka finally located their target. She tapped Shinji on the shoulder and pointed with her other hand towards a large tree near the boundary of the school. Sure enough, Rei was sitting in the shadow of the tree reading a book, and Shinji headed off in that direction, Asuka right on his heels.
现在他们俩都在外面，寻找那标志性的蓝色头发。过了好几分钟，明日香终于发现了目标。她拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，用另一只手指向学校边界附近的一棵大树。果然，绫波坐在树荫下读书，真嗣便朝那个方向走去，明日香紧随其后。
"Um, hello Ayanami," he said as they came to a halt a few feet away from Rei.
"呃，你好，绫波，"他说着，在他们停下脚步，离绫波几英尺远的地方。
"Good afternoon, Ikari," the blue-haired girl said in a quiet and monotonous greeting, not looking up from the book balanced carefully on her cast. Her eyes continued back and forth across the page as she asked, "Do you wish to speak to me about something?"
下午好，碇，"蓝发女孩用平静而单调的声音打招呼，没有抬头，书本稳稳地放在她的石膏上。她的眼睛继续在页面上来回移动，问道："你有什么事想和我谈吗？
"Uh..." Shinji glanced at Asuka, who raised an eyebrow at the other girl's response. He nervously cleared his throat. "I was just... wondering if you're okay now, after what... um... happened to you. I mean, you're at school now and you still have an arm in a cast..."
呃……" 真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，她对另一个女孩的回答挑了挑眉。他紧张地清了清嗓子。"我只是……想知道你现在还好吗，经历了……呃……那件事之后。我是说，你现在来学校了，手臂还打着石膏……
"My physical condition was deemed satisfactory enough to be discharged. I am ready to fight if and when it becomes necessary." Rei turned the page and continued reading.
"我的身体状况被认为已经足够好，可以出院了。如果必要的话，我随时准备战斗。" 绫波翻过一页，继续阅读。
"That's... not quite what I meant."
那……并不是我的本意。
"Hey!" Asuka's sharp voice cut in. "Would it kill you to be polite? Look at him when he's speaking to you!"
"嘿！"明日香尖锐的声音插了进来，"礼貌一点会要你的命吗？他跟你说话的时候看着他！"
Rei looked up... and immediately flinched upon setting her eyes on Shinji. Her book fell off her cast and flopped closed onto the grass. She narrowed her eyes and got to her feet, staring intently at the now puzzled boy.
绫波抬起头来...一看到真嗣就立刻畏缩了。她的书从书架上掉下来，啪的一声合上落在草地上。她眯起眼睛，站起身来，紧盯着眼前这个困惑的男孩。
"So it was not a hallucination," she quietly murmured, confusing Shinji and Asuka even more. Her next words had a hard edge to them. "What are you?"
“看来这不是幻觉，”她低声自语，让真嗣和明日香更加困惑。她接下来的话带着尖锐的语气：“你到底是什么？”
Shinji raised his hands in a placating gesture as he took a step back. "W-what do you m-mean?"
真嗣举起双手做出安抚的手势，同时后退了一步。“你、你是什么意思？”
Rei took a step forward, her free hand clenched at her side. "What. Are you?"
绫波向前迈了一步，她空着的那只手紧握在身旁。“你，是什么？”
"I... I'm human?" he attempted, giving a little shrug and a nervous chuckle.
"我...我是人类吗？"他尝试着说，耸了耸肩，发出了一声紧张的轻笑。
"Then where is your light?"
那你的光在哪里呢？
"My... light?" A plaintive glance at Asuka didn't help Shinji, as the redhead apparently had no idea what was happening either. Fortunately, she decided to finally jump in on the odd conversation.
"我的...光？" 向明日香投去哀怨的一瞥并没有帮到真嗣，因为这位红发少女显然也不知道发生了什么。幸运的是，她最终决定加入这场奇怪的对话。
"How about you stop being weird at my friend and start explaining yourself?"
你能不能别对我朋友怪里怪气的，开始解释一下你自己？
Rei turned to Asuka... and immediately brought up her casted arm to shield her eyes with a sharp intake of breath as if she had accidentally looked at the sun. She lowered her arm a moment later, risking a peek over the cast, before swiftly raising it again.
丽转身面向明日香...随即迅速举起她那打着石膏的手臂，遮住眼睛，猛地吸了一口气，仿佛无意中直视了太阳。片刻后，她放下手臂，冒险从石膏上方偷瞄一眼，然后又迅速举起手臂。
"Before you ask," Asuka continued, arms folded across her chest, "I'm human too. No idea what the hell you mean by asking that though."
在你问之前，" 明日香继续说道，双臂交叉在胸前，"我也是人。至于你问的那个问题是什么意思，我完全不知道。
"Wait a minute," said Shinji as a thought occurred. "Do you think she can... see the, er... problem we have?"
等一下，" 真嗣突然想到什么说道，"你觉得她能... 看到我们遇到的... 那个问题吗？
Asuka blinked. "That's ridiculous. The only reason we know for sure is because of... yesterday."
明日香眨了眨眼。"这太荒谬了。我们之所以确定，完全是因为... 昨天的事。"
"But she must know something," reasoned Shinji. "When I first met her in the Eva cage, she seemed to see that something was wrong with me before anybody else found out."
但她肯定知道些什么，" 新二推理着。"当我第一次在 Eva 笼子里遇见她时，她似乎比任何人都更早察觉到我有什么不对劲。
"What are you?"
你是什么？
That exact same question again. It was still confusing to him, but now it was starting to be for a different reason.
又是那个一模一样的问题。这个问题仍然让他感到困惑，但现在开始有了不同的原因。
Asuka groaned and rubbed her eyes. "Well considering what we've found out recently, I wouldn't be too surprised if the weird girl with blue hair and red eyes is... psychic or whatever." She glared at Rei, still hiding her eyes behind her cast. "Are you?"
明日香叹了口气，揉了揉眼睛。“考虑到我们最近发现的情况，如果那个蓝头发红眼睛的奇怪女孩是……通灵者或什么的，我也不会太惊讶。”她瞪着绫波，后者仍然用石膏遮住眼睛。“你是吗？”
"I do not possess telepathic abilities," Rei replied, before hesitating. After a few awkward seconds, she said, "You, Ikari, do not have a light. And you, Pilot Soryu, your light is almost painful to look at. It is... disconcerting to see the two of you like this."
我并不具备心灵感应的能力，" 绫波丽回答道，随后犹豫了一下。经过几秒钟尴尬的沉默，她说："你，碇，没有光。而你，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你的光几乎让人难以直视。看到你们这样，实在是...令人不安。
"Wait, you already know who I am?"
等等，你已经知道我是谁了？
"Asuka Langley-Soryu, Second Child and pilot of the Production Model, Evangelion Unit-02," Rei instantly replied. "I was informed of your arrival due to Pilot Ikari being insufficiently capable of piloting Unit-01."
Asuka Langley-Soryu，第二适格者及量产型，驾驶着 Evangelion Unit-02，Rei 立刻回答道：“我得知你到来的消息，是因为 Ikari 驾驶员对 Unit-01 的操控能力不足。”
Shinji turned away, a frown on his face at the blunt statement. The school yard was mostly deserted thanks to the heat, but there were still a few stubborn students in the shade near one of the buildings. An idea, as well as something to get back on topic and away from that memory, came to mind.
真嗣转过身去，面对这直白的评价，脸上露出了不悦。由于酷热，校园里几乎空无一人，但仍有几个顽固的学生在建筑物的阴影下坚持着。一个主意，同时也是回到正题并远离那段记忆的方法，涌上心头。
"Hey Ayanami," he began. Rei peeked out from behind her cast at him, and he pointed towards the students. "Are they too bright to look at as well?"
嘿，绫波，" 他开始说道。绫波从她的石膏后面偷偷看向他，他指向学生们。"他们也太耀眼了，对吧？
Rei lowered her cast, and looked at the students for a few seconds. "They are bright, but not painfully so." Her head started to turn towards Asuka, but stopped short. It took almost half a minute, and eventually a hand mostly covering her eyes, but eventually she managed to at least partially look at Asuka. "You are like staring at two people at once, their light overlapping and magnifying each other."
绫波放下她的石膏，凝视了学生们几秒钟。"他们很明亮，但并不刺眼。" 她的头开始转向明日香，但又停了下来。几乎过了半分钟，她最终用手遮住眼睛，但最终还是设法至少部分地看向了明日香。"你就像同时盯着两个人看，他们的光芒交叠并相互增强。"
Asuka rolled her eyes when Shinji shot her a knowing look. "Two people. Well I guess that proves it then," she said as she turned away in exasperation. "Unless she's just toying with us for some unknown reason."
当真嗣向她投去一个心照不宣的眼神时，明日香翻了个白眼。“两个人。好吧，我想这足以证明一切了，”她说着，带着恼怒转过身去。“除非她只是出于某种未知的原因在戏弄我们。”
"I have no reason to lie."
我没有理由说谎。
"And I believe her," Shinji added. "So... should we tell her? About the contract and such?"
“我相信她，”真嗣补充道。“那么……我们应该告诉她吗？关于那份合同之类的事？”
"I suppose..."
我想...
The rest of the lunch period was spent filling Rei in on all they could tell her about the soul contract, finishing just as the warning bell rang.
午餐时间的剩余部分都用来向零详细解释关于灵魂契约的一切，直到预备铃响起才结束。
"I am finding this somewhat hard to believe," said Rei as they began to head back to class.
"我有点难以相信，" 丽说，他们开始返回教室。
"Oh, trust me, you're not alone there," Asuka replied exasperatedly.
"哦，相信我，你并不孤单，" 明日香不耐烦地回答。
"But just as I have no reason to lie to you, I see no reason for you to lie to me. And it does fit with what I can see." Rei paused as they reached the double doors leading into the building. "I... apologise for my attitude earlier. I thought you were-" She cut herself off with a frown and stepped inside.
"但正如我没有理由对你撒谎一样，我看不出你有理由对我撒谎。这确实符合我所见。" 当他们到达通往建筑物的双扇门时，Rei 停顿了一下。"我...为早先的态度道歉。我以为你是——" 她皱着眉头打断了自己的话，然后走了进去。
"Thought we were what?" Shinji asked as he and Asuka got out of the heat.
"以为我们是什么？" 真嗣边问边和明日香走出热浪。
"Not both, just you, Pilot Ikari. And I cannot speak of it."
不是两个，只有你，碇真嗣驾驶员。我无法谈论这件事。
"Why not?"
为什么不呢？
"That is classified."
那是机密。
"Of course it is," Asuka grumped. "Why would anything be easy?"
当然不容易，" 明日香抱怨道，"为什么会有事情是简单的呢？
"If she can't tell us, then she can't tell us," reasoned Shinji. "Anyway, before we get to class, could we please do the other thing we wanted to find Ayanami for?"
如果她不能告诉我们，那就是不能告诉我们，" 真嗣推理道，"不管怎样，在我们去上课之前，我们能不能先做我们原本想找绫波丽做的那件事？
"Excuse me?" asked Rei as she stopped, turning to look at them with a visible wince.
"打扰一下？" 绫波丽停下脚步，转过身来看着他们，脸上明显露出一丝痛苦的表情。
"Hm?" Asuka thought for a second. "Oh. Right. Let us properly introduce ourself." She then muttered, "For all the good it will do."
嗯？" 明日香想了一下。"哦，对了。让我们正式介绍一下自己。" 她接着嘀咕道，"尽管这可能没什么用。
Shinji went first, giving his name but stopping short when he almost added 'former pilot of Unit-01'. Asuka's was a carbon copy of her greeting to Class 2-A, right down to the 'Charmed, huh?' at the end.
真嗣首先发言，报上姓名后差点加上“初号机前驾驶员”，但及时打住。明日香的自我介绍与她在 2 年 A 班的如出一辙，结尾依旧是那句“很荣幸，对吧？”
Rei gave a short little bow. "I am Rei Ayanami, pilot of the Prototype Evangelion Unit-00."
绫波丽微微鞠了一躬。"我是绫波丽，零号机原型机的驾驶员。"
"You know," said Asuka. "It would be convenient if we could be friends."
“你知道，”明日香说，“如果我们能成为朋友，那就方便多了。”
As she straightened back up, Rei gave as much of a flat expression as she could without looking directly at Asuka. "What purpose would that serve?"
当她重新挺直身子时，绫波尽力摆出一副平淡的表情，没有直接看向明日香。“那有什么意义呢？”
Asuka's eyes widened, apparently taking offence to the response. "What the hell does that mean?!"
明日香的眼睛睁大了，显然对这回答感到冒犯。“这他妈是什么意思？！”
"I think it's a good idea," Shinji hurriedly said, almost wanting to stand between them to stop a potential fight. "There's no harm in it, and it could only help you two when you're piloting if you have a positive relationship with each other."
我觉得这是个好主意，" 真嗣急忙插话，几乎想站到两人中间以防止可能的冲突。"这并无不妥，而且你们在驾驶时若能保持良好关系，只会对双方有利。

Rei seemed to think on this, before nodding her head at Asuka. "That is an appropriate reason. I accept your offer of friendship."
丽似乎沉思了片刻，随后向明日香点头示意。“这确实是个合适的理由。我接受你的友谊。”

"Er... good?" Asuka lamely replied, before walking quickly past the other two teenagers. "Anyway we better get to class! At least we don't have to listen to the windbag for the rest of the day!"
呃... 还好吧？" 明日香含糊地应了一句，随即快步超过另外两个少年。"总之，我们快去上课吧！至少今天不用再忍受那个长舌妇了！

Rei followed, and Shinji was not far behind. He sighed internally. If he had actually managed to not screw things up and become Unit-01's pilot, maybe that friendship offer would have extended to him too.
丽紧随其后，真嗣也紧跟不舍。他暗自叹息。如果他当初没有搞砸，成为了初号机的驾驶员，或许那份友谊的橄榄枝也会向他伸出。

Why was he even still in Tokyo-3? He had been fully expecting to end up back in Fujikawa with his teacher after washing out. Was it just too much effort to arrange a return trip? His father had been completely absent since their first meeting in the Eva cage, obviously too busy to waste time on him. He would just have to make the most of his lot in life as usual. Eventually Misato would get tired of him.
他为何还留在第三新东京市？原本预想的是，一旦被淘汰就会随老师返回藤川。难道安排一次回程太过麻烦？自从在 Eva 机库那次见面后，他的父亲便杳无音讯，显然忙得无暇他顾。他只能一如既往地，尽力适应自己的处境。最终，葛城美里也会对他失去耐心。

Just like his aunt and uncle had, shipping him off to Fujikawa to stay with the teacher that was apparently a friend of the family, only a year after taking him in.
如同他的姑姑和姑父所做的，在他被收养仅一年后，便将他送往藤川，与那位显然是家族友人的老师同住。

Just like his father had, getting rid of him only a couple of months after... that.
正如他父亲所做的，在...那件事后仅几个月就抛弃了他。

As he neared the classroom, Shinji rubbed a hand across his face, banishing the despondent look for the time being. If Misato ended up being too busy to send him back to Fujikawa...
真嗣走近教室时，用手抹了把脸，暂时将沮丧的神情抛诸脑后。万一美里忙得无暇送他回藤川...

Maybe he'd just have to do it himself.
看来他可能不得不自己动手了。

XXX

Days passed, and the two female pilots slowly began testing their new friendship out. It took a little while before Rei managed to look properly at Asuka, and even then Shinji caught the occasional wince whenever Rei turned to the redhead.
时光流转，两位女飞行员逐渐开始探索她们新建立的友谊。经过一段时间，绫波才逐渐能直视明日香，但真嗣仍不时察觉到绫波转向红发少女时，脸上掠过的微妙痛楚。

Rei did not speak much to begin with; the few times she did made her seem rather frosty. Soon though, Asuka managed to thaw her out a little. It quickly became apparent that Rei had no opinion or interest in 'normal' conversation topics, such as the school gossip or what was on television, so things to talk about were rather thin on the ground.
最初，绫波很少开口，偶尔说话时显得有些冷漠。不久，明日香的努力让她稍微敞开了心扉。很明显，绫波对学校流言或电视节目这类平常话题毫无兴趣，导致聊天的话题相当有限。

Because of the warm weather, whenever they did go outside it was usually to the tree under which they had met the First Child.
因为天气暖和，他们每次出门，往往都会去那棵树下，那里是他们第一次遇见第一个孩子的地方。

What surprised both Asuka and Shinji was that Rei could also read and speak German. Rei had stated that she had taught herself so that she could read several medical textbooks, at least one of which always seemed to be in her school bag. That at least gave them something of a useful conversation topic. Soon, the three pilots were speaking purely in German during their lunch breaks.
让明日香和真嗣感到意外的是，绫波丽竟然能读写并说德语。她透露，自己自学德语是为了阅读几本医学教科书，其中至少一本常备于她的书包中。这至少为他们增添了一个有益的谈资。很快，三位驾驶员在午餐时间便开始全程使用德语交谈。

Or to be more precise, Rei and Asuka talked while Shinji usually stayed quiet. Most of the time he couldn't think of anything to add to the conversation, not being nearly as scientifically inclined as the two girls, or just didn't want to get in the way of their slowly developing friendship. If Asuka or Rei noticed how little he spoke, they didn't show it. His main contribution to their lunchtime together generally consisted of preparing their meals, since the cafeteria's selection clearly fell far short of being considered real food. Rei had tried to decline, but after relenting and taking a bite, her resistance fell and she began accepting the free meals from the Third Child, once he made adjustments for the fact that she was a vegetarian.
更确切地说，绫波和明日香交谈时，真嗣往往沉默寡言。他多数时候要么是插不上话，毕竟他对科学的兴趣远不及两位女孩，要么就是不愿打扰她们日渐加深的友情。若明日香或绫波察觉到他话少，她们也未曾表露。他在午餐时的主要贡献是准备餐食，毕竟食堂的菜品实在难以称得上是真正的食物。起初绫波婉拒，但尝过一口后，她便不再抗拒，开始接受第三适格者为她特制的素食餐。

And then one day, Aida came up to them at lunch with something of a warning.
后来有一天，艾达在午餐时走过来，向他们发出了一丝警告。

"Ikari. Soryu," he said by way of greeting upon reaching their little patch of shade. "Remember your first day? When Hikari and I talked about Suzuhara and his sister?"
他走到他们那片阴凉地，开口打招呼：“碇真嗣，惣流。还记得你刚来的那天吗？我和明日香聊起了铃原和他妹妹的事。”

Shinji froze. His stomach once again turned queasy. Asuka noticed, and shot him a pointed glance.
真嗣愣住了。他的胃又开始翻腾起来。明日香察觉到了，便向他投去了一个意味深长的目光。

"Well apparently his sister decided she wasn't going to get any worse, and that she didn't need to be babysat at the hospital everyday," Aida continued, oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside Shinji. "She demanded that he return to school."
显然，他的妹妹认为自己不会继续恶化，无需每天在医院有人陪护，" 艾达继续说着，未察觉真嗣内心的波澜。"她坚持要他回学校上课。

"'Demanded'?" Asuka replied with a raised eyebrow. "And what, he's just gonna let himself be pushed around by his little sister?"
‘被要求了？’明日香挑眉反问，‘难道他就甘愿被妹妹牵着鼻子走？’

Aida nodded. "Exactly. He adores her. Would probably go to Hell and back if that's what it takes to heal her. Even I'd do what she says, otherwise she'd kick me in the shins or something. And she's good at that. Anyway, Suzuhara's returning tomorrow. Just thought I'd warn you two."
艾达点头说：“确实如此，他深爱着她。为了治愈她，他恐怕愿意下地狱再回来。我也会听从她，否则她会踢我的小腿之类的。她在这方面很有一套。对了，铃原明天回来，提前告诉你们一声。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes. "Why? What do we have to be concerned about?"
明日香眯起双眼，问道：“怎么了？我们有什么可担心的？”

Aida raised a hand to adjust his glasses. Sunlight glinted off the lenses as he smirked. "I know it was one of you two that piloted the giant robot."
艾达伸手调整眼镜，阳光在镜片上闪烁，他带着一丝得意的微笑：“我知道是你们俩中的一个操控了那台巨型机器人。”

"How did you come to that conclusion?" Rei asked, staring a hole into Aida's head.
"你是怎么得出这个结论的？" 蕾问道，目光锐利地盯着相田。

"It's far too convenient. The robot appears, NERV is suddenly all over our school, and then you two come into our class." Aida tapped the side of his head. "I'm not stupid. I've seen those men in black suits shadow you. You leave school, a moment later they do."
这未免太巧了。机器人一出现，NERV 就突然遍布我们学校，紧接着你们俩就进了我们班。" 相田敲了敲自己的脑袋，"我可不笨。我注意到那些穿黑西装的人一直在暗中跟踪你们。你们前脚刚离开学校，他们后脚就跟上。

Asuka glanced at Shinji, who could only offer a helpless look back.
明日香瞟了真嗣一眼，真嗣只能回以一副无可奈何的表情。

Aida leaned forward conspiratorially. "So which one of you was it?"
阿依达神秘兮兮地向前倾身，问道：“你们当中，到底是谁？”

"If you do not wish to be arrested, you will cease this line of inquiry immediately."
若不想被逮捕，请立即停止这一调查。

Everyone stared at Rei, who was now almost glaring at Aida.
众人目光齐聚于零，此刻她几乎是在怒视艾达。

"NERV takes the security of its employees very seriously," she continued. "Should you persist in harassing us, they may decide you are dangerous."
NERV 极其重视员工的安全，"她接着说，"若你执意骚扰，他们或许会判定你构成威胁。

"Whoa whoa!" Aida waved his hands in the air in front of him and shook his head. "I'm not trying to harass you, I'm just letting you know that Toji's going to... ah... be mad."
哎呀，哎呀！" 阿依达在面前挥动双手，摇了摇头。"我并非有意打扰，只是想提醒你，东司他...呃...可能会发火。

"But why would he..." Asuka began, before trailing off. She grabbed a fistful of the fearful boy's shirt and yanked him close. "You told him about us didn't you?!" she almost shouted in his face.
"可是他怎么会知道..." 飞鸟刚开口，话音未落。她一把揪住那惊恐男孩的衣领，用力拽到跟前。"是你告诉他我们的关系的，是不是？" 她几乎是对着他的脸怒吼。

"I-it just slipped out, I-I s-swear!" Aida stammered. "He called me and asked if anything was happening at school, and I told him you two arrived right after the attack! He got real quiet after that." He looked away from Asuka's burning stare. "I think he came to his own conclusion."
我-我真的是无意中说漏了嘴，我发誓！" 阿依达结巴着说，"他打电话来问学校有没有什么动静，我就告诉他你们俩在袭击发生后不久就到了！之后他就沉默了。" 他躲开了明日香锐利的目光，"我觉得他已经有了自己的判断。

"Feh." Asuka released him with a little push, and Aida slowly retreated.
"哼。" 明日香轻推了他一下，相田便慢慢退开了。

"Look, for what it's worth I'm really sorry," he said.
"不管怎样，我真的很抱歉，"他如此说道。

"Just get the hell out of here, nerd."
赶紧离开这儿，书呆子。

Perhaps deciding that discretion was the better part of valour, Aida did as she said and retreated back inside the school building.
或许觉得谨慎胜于鲁莽，阿依达依言而行，退回了校舍之中。

"I'm going to have to apologise to him," Shinji dejectedly mumbled. "It's the only way to make this right."
我得向他道歉了，" 真嗣沮丧地低声说。"只有这样才能弥补过错。

"You're not apologising for a damn thing," Asuka retorted sharply. "What did I say about it not being your fault?"
你这哪算道歉，" 明日香尖锐地回击，"我不是说过这事不怪你吗？

"If it was you in that situation, would you see things so clearly?"
如果你身处那种境况，是否也能看得如此透彻？

"You are not at fault here, Ikari," Rei interjected. "You were brought in because I had been injured."
你并无过错，碇，"绫波打断道，"叫你来是因为我受了伤。

"Oh, don't you start," Asuka groaned. "NERV are the ones that screwed up by leaving things to the last minute. The moment you were injured and deemed unable to pilot, Shinji should have been put on a plane and brought here to start training. Instead... well... look how things turned out."
哦，别提了，" 明日香抱怨道。"NERV 就是拖到最后一刻才搞砸的。你一受伤，被判定不能驾驶，就该马上让真嗣坐飞机来这里开始训练。结果呢...看看现在这局面。

Rei took the admonishment silently, staring blankly at nothing for a minute. Suddenly, she inhaled sharply and looked at Shinji. "Wait. That would perhaps have been worse."
绫默默承受了训斥，眼神空洞地凝视着前方，愣了一会儿。忽然，她深吸一口气，转向真嗣。“等等，那样可能更糟糕。”

"What do you mean?" asked a puzzled Shinji. "If I had gotten here earlier and had time to train, I wouldn't have performed so terribly against that Angel."
你指的是什么？" 真嗣一脸不解。"要是我能早点来，有足够时间训练，对付那个使徒时也不至于那么狼狈。

"No," said Asuka, before slapping her forehead with the palm of her hand. "Shit, she's right. If you'd come here early, NERV would have found out about your... problem then."
不，"阿苏卡说着，用手掌拍了拍额头。"该死，她说的没错。要是你早点来，NERV 早就察觉到你的问题了。

"Correct," agreed Rei. "You would have been deemed an unsuitable pilot for Unit-01. I would most likely have been sent out against the Third Angel anyway."
没错，" 雷伊赞同地说。"你原本就会被认为不适合驾驶初号机。我大概率还是会被派去迎战第三使徒。

"Where you would have probably died..." Shinji breathed, recalling the terrible state she had been in when they had first met. He looked down at his hands. Was that a spot of red? "You were in no condition to even get out of bed, let alone pilot."
你本可能就那样死去……" 真嗣喘着气，回想起她当初那副惨不忍睹的样子。他低头凝视自己的双手，那上面是否沾染了血迹？"你那时连床都下不了，更不用说驾驶了。

Rei solemnly shook her head. "That does not matter. The Angels must be defeated at any cost. If I die, I can be replaced."
绫严肃地摇了摇头，说：“那无关紧要。无论如何，天使都必须被击败。即使我牺牲了，也会有替代者。”

The matter-of-fact way she said that caused both Asuka and Shinji's eyes to widen in shock. None of them managed to speak again before the warning bell for the end of lunch rang. In a daze, the two roommates got up and headed back inside, Rei silently following behind.
她那平淡的语气让明日香和真嗣震惊得瞪大了眼睛，一时间都说不出话来。直到午餐结束的铃声响起，两人才如梦初醒，起身返回室内，绫波则默默地跟在后面。

XXX

Asuka had told Shinji to go on ahead to their usual spot and that she and Rei would be there in a few minutes. Having read between the lines and realising that Asuka didn't feel like saying what personal business they were doing, he had immediately headed off.
明日香让真嗣先去他们常去的地方等着，她和零几分钟后就到。真嗣察觉到明日香不愿多说她们的私事，便识趣地先行一步。

Right into Toji Suzuhara's waiting fist.
正中铃原东治蓄势待发的拳头。

Shinji reeled as it connected with his face. He staggered backwards, holding a hand over his now throbbing cheek as his back bumped into the tree.
真嗣被击中脸部，不由得踉跄后退，一手捂着阵阵作痛的脸颊，背部撞上了树干。

Shinji stared up at Suzuhara, idly noting that Aida was almost hiding behind the seething tracksuit-clad boy. Aida gave a helpless shrug when he noticed Shinji glancing at him. His gaze was unwillingly drawn back to Suzuhara when two hands grabbed his shirt and almost lifted him off the ground.
真嗣抬头望向铃原，不经意间发现相田几乎藏在那位穿着运动服、怒火中烧的男孩身后。察觉到真嗣的目光，相田无助地耸了耸肩。当有人猛地抓住他的衬衫，几乎将他拽离地面时，他的视线不由自主地再次聚焦到铃原身上。

"Got anything to say for yourself, punk?" Suzuhara demanded as he slammed Shinji into the tree.
"你还有什么话要说吗，小子？" 铃原厉声质问，一把将真嗣推到树干上。

Last night, Asuka had once again tried to get it into his head that he wasn't to blame, and that if he should end up confronting Suzuhara, he should say as much. But that logic still evaporated in the face of a boy who had almost lost his sister. And it wouldn't have taken much effort to work out who he was, considering he and Asuka were the only new additions to Class 2-A. Having evidently decided not to go after Asuka, for whatever reason, Toji must have decided it was him piloting the robot that had injured his sister.
昨晚，明日香再次努力让东治明白，他并非责任所在，若他真要面对铃原，应直言不讳。然而，面对一个险些失去妹妹的少年，这番道理依旧难以立足。考虑到他和明日香是 2-A 班仅有的新成员，他的身份不难猜出。显然，出于某种原因，东治决定不追究明日香，他必定认为驾驶机器人伤害他妹妹的人就是自己。

Shinji could only hold eye contact for a few seconds before breaking, looking down and to the side. That only seemed to make things worse. Shinji heard a growl, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Suzuhara raise a fist again. He closed his eyes and waited.
真嗣仅能维持短暂的眼神交流，随后便垂下目光，转向一侧。此举似乎加剧了局势。他耳边传来一声低沉的咆哮，眼角余光捕捉到铃原再次举拳的动作。真嗣闭上双眼，静候其变。

But nothing happened. 然而，什么事情都没有发生。

When nothing continued to happen after a few more seconds, he hesitantly opened his eyes to a surprising and thankful sight.
又过了几秒，依旧毫无动静，他迟疑地睁开双眼，映入眼帘的是一个令人惊喜又感激的场景。

Asuka was there, a hand clenched tightly around Suzuhara's wrist preventing the punch from landing. Rei was also nearby, a frown on her face as she observed what was happening.
明日香就在那里，一只手紧紧攥住铃原的手腕，阻止了即将挥出的拳头。绫波也在一旁，眉头紧锁，注视着事态的发展。

"First and only warning, asshole," snarled Asuka. "Leave. Him. Alone." Suzuhara, looking rather shocked that somebody had stopped his fist without much effort, opened his mouth, but she continued before he could speak. "We don't have time for your bullshit. We need to leave now, and you two idiots will soon need to get to a shelter."
这是第一次也是最后一次警告，混蛋，"飞鸟厉声说道，"别再纠缠他。"铃原显得十分震惊，居然有人能轻易拦下他的拳头，他刚要开口，飞鸟却抢先一步："我们没工夫听你胡扯。现在就得撤，你们俩也赶紧找个地方避难去。

"Shelter?" Aida echoed. "You mean-"
避难所吗？" 艾达重复道。"你是说-

"There will soon be another attack," said Rei. "We are needed at NERV."
很快就会再次发生袭击，" Rei 说道，"我们得去 NERV。

Suzuhara sighed angrily and let Shinji go. Asuka put a hand on her friend's shoulder and led him away.
铃原气愤地叹了口气，松开了真嗣。明日香把手搭在朋友肩上，领着他走开了。

"This ain't over!" Suzuhara yelled at their retreating backs.
"这事还没结束！" 铃原对着他们撤退的背影大声喊道。

Without looking back, Asuka said, "When we return, I'm going to explain in simple words what happened. After that, if you still want to take it out on us, then I'll be happy to oblige."
明日香没有回头，说道：“等我们回去，我会用最简单的话告诉你发生了什么。之后，如果你还想找我们算账，我随时奉陪。”

"Another attack," Shinji mumbled as they got into the Section Two car. "But why am I being brought along?"
又是一次袭击，" 真嗣低声自语，随着他们进入第二部门的车辆。"可为什么我也要跟着去呢？

"May as well ask why Rei is coming too," replied Asuka, buckling her seatbelt before folding her arms. "She can't pilot yet."
不如问问为什么绫也要来，"飞鸟说着，系好安全带后双臂交叉。"她现在还不能驾驶。

"Standard procedure for an emergency," said Rei. "Pilots must be secured and brought to the Geofront even if they will not be deployed."
雷伊说：‘这是紧急情况下的标准程序，飞行员必须被安全送至 Geofront，即使他们不会立即投入使用。’

Shinji frowned. "But I'm not a pilot..."
真嗣皱着眉头说：“可我并不是驾驶员啊……”

"It's probably the safest place on the planet, Shinji," Asuka swiftly cut in. "Would you rather sit in a shelter? No clue what's happening outside?"
这恐怕是地球上最安全的地方了，真嗣，" 明日香迅速打断他。"难道你想坐在避难所里，对外面的情况一无所知吗？

"...No thanks." ...不用谢。

"That's what I thought. Just accept that you're still important enough to get special treatment."
我也是这么想的。承认吧，你依然重要到能享受特殊关照。

### Chapter 06 Shamshel

Shinji felt shame, twisting deep in his gut. All he could do was watch as Asuka got off the elevator and headed to the change room. As the door closed and the elevator continued, his gaze dropped to the floor. Only a few seconds later, he had to look up as the door opened again and Rei stepped out. It wasn't clear why two non-combatants were going to be allowed on the bridge, but he was certainly not keen to be left in the dark.
真嗣感到羞愧在腹中翻腾。他只能眼睁睁看着明日香走出电梯，朝更衣室走去。随着门关闭，电梯继续运行，他的目光垂向地面。仅几秒后，他不得不抬头，因为门再次开启，零走了出来。不清楚为何两个非战斗人员会被允许进入舰桥，但他显然不愿被蒙在鼓里。
And he wanted to see his friend's debut.
他想见证好友的首次亮相。
"How are we looking?" he heard Misato ask as they reached the bridge. The holographic screen showed a topographical map of the bay area, where a red blip was moving towards the city.
“情况怎么样？”他听到美里问道，此时他们已到达桥上。全息屏幕展示着湾区地形图，一个红色光点正向城市移动。
"It will pass the first line in approximately eight minutes," Aoba reported.
"大约八分钟后，它将通过第一条线，"青叶报告道。
"Open fire as soon as it's in range," Misato ordered after a moment's thought. "Let's test its strength, see what it can do. Do we have a visual?"
"一旦进入射程就开火，" 碇真嗣稍作思考后命令道，"让我们测测它的实力，看看它有何能耐。能看到目标吗？"
Without a word, part of the holographic screen changed. Now it showed a view evidently from the nose of an aerial pursuer. A purple worm-like creature was floating over the ocean, with two bright pink appendages trailing from what appeared to be its arms. Its head was what drew Shinji's attention. Pink and bulbous, it looked like...
无声无息间，全息屏幕的一部分发生了变化。此刻，屏幕上显示的显然是从一架空中追击者的机头视角所见。一只紫色的蠕虫状生物正漂浮在海面上，从其手臂处延伸出两条明亮的粉红色附肢。然而，真正吸引真嗣目光的是它的头部。那粉嫩而圆润的头部，看起来宛如……
"Is this a joke?" Misato muttered, unamused. "Did some fraternity stunt get loose? That looks exactly like a-"
"这是在开玩笑吗？" 碇真嗣低声说道，毫无笑意。"难道是哪个兄弟会的恶作剧跑出来了？那看起来完全就像是一个——"
"It's definitely an Angel," Ritsuko interrupted. "The phallic appearance is likely entirely coincidental."
“这绝对是使徒，”律子插话道，“其外形类似生殖器很可能完全是个巧合。”
There was no hint of emotion on the scientist's face when Shinji glanced at her. Stony eyes in an almost bored-looking face gazed at the screen. Rei had almost the same expression, staring dispassionately at the Angel. By comparison, the female technician, Lieutenant Ibuki if he remembered correctly, had a bit of redness in her cheeks. He thought he might have heard Misato murmur something that sounded like, "So boring, Rits," but he may have imagined it, as when he looked at his guardian she was staring seriously at the screen.
当真嗣瞥向那位科学家时，她的脸上没有流露出一丝情感。那双冷硬的眼睛在看似厌倦的面容上，凝视着屏幕。绫波的表情几乎如出一辙，冷漠地盯着使徒。相比之下，如果他没记错的话，那位名叫伊吹的女技术军官，脸颊上泛着些许红晕。他觉得自己可能听到美里低声嘟囔了一句，“真无聊，Rits，”但他或许只是幻听，因为当他看向自己的监护人时，她正严肃地盯着屏幕。
"The Second Child has entered the Eva cage," Hyuga reported.
"第二适格者已进入 Eva 驾驶舱。"日向报告道。
Another screen change showed the red-haired pilot walking along the gantry towards Unit-01's entry plug, which was already open and waiting for her. She stepped in without a moment's hesitation, and the hatch closed. The entry plug was then inserted into the back of the purple Evangelion's neck, and an armour plate closed over it. Shinji listened with half an ear as the bridge crew began rattling off numbers that made no sense to him. All was apparently well, however, as he soon heard the most important words.
另一屏画面切换，展示着红发飞行员沿着栈桥走向初号机的插入栓，那入口已然敞开，静候她的到来。她毫不犹豫地跨入其中，舱门随即关闭。接着，插入栓被置入紫色福音战士后颈，一块装甲板随之合拢。真嗣半听半漏地听着指挥舱人员开始报出一串对他毫无意义的数字，但显然一切顺利，因为他很快听到了最关键的话语。
"Eva Unit-01 is online. No anomalies detected."
伊娃零号机已上线，未检测到异常。
"Excellent. Open a channel to the pilot," said Misato. A large hologram of Asuka in the entry plug flashed to life in front of them. "All good on your end, Asuka?"
“很好。接通飞行员的频道，” 碇真嗣说道。一个巨大的明日香在插入栓内的全息影像在他们面前闪现出来。“你那边一切正常吗，明日香？”
"Everything seems fine to me," the Second Child replied. "Surprisingly it feels a bit like my own Eva."
"在我看来一切都很正常，"第二适格者回答道，"说来奇怪，感觉有点像我自己的 Eva。"
"That's good. Unfortunately Unit-01 doesn't have a spike launcher, so it won't be quite the same."
那挺好的。可惜初号机没有配备尖刺发射器，所以不会完全一样。
"Then I'll just go without. But you are sending weapons up for me, right?"
那我就不要了。但你还是会给我送武器上去的，对吧？
Ritsuko passed Misato a tablet, and the captain glanced at the data. "We're preparing a Gatling gun for delivery to the surface. There will also be Pallet Rifles, but stick with the Gatling gun at the start. And of course there's a Progressive Knife in the pauldron if you need to resort to melee combat."
律子递给美里一个平板，队长瞥了一眼数据。“我们正准备将加特林机枪运送到地面。还会有调色板步枪，但一开始请坚持使用加特林机枪。当然，如果需要近战，肩甲里也备有进步刀。”
"Be careful Asuka!" Shinji finally managed to blurt out. Her eyes swept over to him and she gave a cocky grin.
"小心点，明日香！" 真嗣终于脱口而出。她的目光扫向他，露出了一个得意的笑容。
"Hey, I've been training for this my whole life," she said. "I'll be fine."
嘿，我这辈子都在为此训练，" 她说，"我会没事的。
Shinji nodded hesitantly, and watched as Unit-01 was loaded onto the catapult that would take it to the surface. After a few seconds, Misato stepped forward.
真嗣犹豫地点了点头，目睹着零号机被装载到即将将其送往地面的弹射器上。几秒钟后，美里走上前去。
"Eva Unit-01, launch!"
初号机，发射！
With a rumble that Shinji felt in his feet, the catapult took off, rocketing towards the surface and the incoming enemy.
随着一阵震得真嗣脚底发麻的轰鸣声，弹射器启动了，向着地表和迎面而来的敌人疾驰而去。
"Good luck," Shinji whispered.
"祝你好运，" 真嗣低声说道。
XXX
Unit-01 wobbled slightly as the catapult slammed to a halt and the locks disengaged. Asuka inhaled deeply as she took her first steps on the surface in somebody else's Evangelion, before proceeding towards the building marked on her heads up display. There, she retrieved a power cable and inserted it into the socket on the Evangelion's back, removing the obnoxious battery warnings, and then headed towards the next waypoint.
初号机在弹射器猛然停止、锁扣松开时微微摇晃。明日香深吸一口气，踏上了别人的福音战士，迈出了在表面的第一步，随后朝着抬头显示器上标记的建筑前进。在那里，她取出一根电源线，插入福音战士背部的插座，消除了恼人的电池警告，然后向着下一个航点进发。
It was actually somewhat surprising how smoothly the Test-Type was performing in her hands, even with the slightly lower sync ratio compared to her own Unit-02. Then again, she was the best Evangelion pilot. Asuka briefly wondered what she could make Unit-01 do, but there was no time for experimenting; the Fourth Angel was starting to become visible as a small dot on the horizon.
实际上，测试型在她手中运行得如此顺畅，甚至与她自己的二号机相比，同步率略有下降，这多少有些令人惊讶。毕竟，她是最好的福音战士驾驶员。明日香短暂地想象了一下她能让初号机做些什么，但没有时间进行实验；第四使徒开始在地平线上以一个小点的形式变得可见。
The armoury building at her second stop opened as Unit-01 halted in front of it, and Asuka beheld the weapon that had been given to her. The Gatling gun was almost the size of the building that housed it, but the Evangelion was able to pick it up with only slight effort. After a moment's thought, a Pallet Rifle was retrieved and attached to magnetic clips on Unit-01's back.
她的第二站，军械库的大门在初号机停下时缓缓开启，明日香目睹了分配给她的武器。那挺加特林机枪几乎与存放它的建筑一样庞大，但使徒却能轻松地将其举起。经过片刻思考，一把弹匣步枪被取出，并固定在初号机背部的磁性夹具上。
"Two minutes," came the warning from Misato.
"两分钟，" 来自美里警告的声音响起。
Only slightly weighed down by the hardware, Asuka moved on to the final waypoint, stopping next to an armoured building. She pointed the Gatling gun in the direction she had come from and got a feel for the the weapon by revving it up, keeping a finger well away from the trigger, as she swept it back and forth. Satisfied, she hefted it up, leaning the barrel against Unit-01's shoulder, and pressed its back against the building.
尽管硬件略有负担，Asuka 还是继续前往最后一个路标，停在一座装甲建筑旁。她将加特林机枪指向来时的方向，通过启动机枪来感受武器的性能，手指远离扳机，来回扫射。满意后，她举起机枪，将枪管靠在 Unit-01 的肩膀上，背部紧贴建筑。
About ten seconds after the call of "One minute", the hills around Tokyo-3 lit up as the fixed weapon emplacements opened fire, sending high explosive ordinance streaking through the sky towards the Angel. Asuka couldn't see what was happening, but based on what she had seen and heard about the effects of conventional weapons against the Third Angel, she would soon be turning her own weaponry on a target that would be completely unharmed.
在“一分钟”的呼叫后大约十秒，东京-3 周围的丘陵亮起，固定武器阵地开始射击，将高爆弹药射向天空，直指使徒。Asuka 虽然看不到发生了什么，但根据她所见所闻，常规武器对第三使徒无效，她很快就会用自己的武器对付一个完全不受伤害的目标。
But it wouldn't stay that way for long if she had anything to say about it.
但如果她有话要说，这种情况不会持续太久。
Before the first word of Misato's next order left her mouth, Asuka had already turned onto the street that the Angel was heading towards. She spared only a second's thought for its appearance before squeezing the trigger on her weapon. The Gatling gun spat depleted uranium rounds at her target, and Asuka had to resist the sudden urge to give a hearty laugh as she unleashed a hundred rounds a second.
在葛城美里下达下一道命令之前，明日香已经拐上了使徒正前往的那条街道。她只用了一秒钟的时间来思考使徒的外貌，然后就扣动了武器的扳机。加特林机枪向目标喷射出贫铀弹，明日香不得不抑制住突然想要放声大笑的冲动，因为她正以每秒一百发的速度倾泻子弹。
"Ease up, Asuka, you're obscuring the target!" Misato's words cut through her euphoria, and Asuka relaxed her trigger finger, ending the barrage for the moment but keeping the weapon spinning. Unit-01 took a few slow and careful steps backwards, the Gatling gun pointing towards the cloud of smoke and dust filling her forward view. She squeezed the trigger once more, but only held it for a moment before releasing again. Asuka continued stutter-firing for a few seconds before a flash of light caught her eye.
"放松点，明日香，你挡住目标了！" 美里的话打断了她的兴奋，明日香松开了扣动扳机的手指，暂时停止了扫射，但仍让武器继续旋转。初号机缓慢而谨慎地后退几步，加特林枪指向她前方弥漫的烟尘。她再次扣动扳机，但只持续了一会儿就松开了。明日香继续断断续续地射击了几秒钟，直到一道闪光吸引了她的注意。
One of the Angel's bright pink appendages whipped out of the cloud, slicing through the lower floors of a building next to Unit-01 as if it wasn't there. It would have cut straight through the Gatling gun too, had Asuka not dropped it before jumping the Evangelion backwards out of the way. Several buildings in front of her, including the armoured one she had taken cover behind, slowly slid apart before collapsing.
天使的一根亮粉色触手从烟雾中猛然甩出，仿佛不存在一般切穿了初号机旁边建筑的底层。如果明日香没有及时丢掉加特林枪并让福音战士向后跳开，它也会直接切断加特林枪。她面前的几栋建筑，包括她曾用来掩护的装甲建筑，缓缓裂开，然后坍塌。
She didn't have time to gawk at the damage. The Angel barrelled head first out of the cloud and flew directly towards Unit-01. With no space around her to get out of the way, Asuka took the only route available to her.
她没有时间去惊讶于所造成的破坏。天使从云层中猛冲而出，径直向零号机飞去。由于周围没有空间躲避，明日香只能选择唯一可行的路线。
Up.
Unit-01 bent its legs and leapt into the air, just barely clearing the Angel as it flew past like a freight train. The Evangelion's feet landed on the ground scant meters behind the tubular end of the Angel, and Asuka turned around just in time to see a row of buildings on both sides of the street get sliced through by the pink energy whips.
零号机屈膝一跃而起，勉强在天使如货运列车般掠过时躲开。福音战士的双脚落在天使圆筒状尾部后方仅几米的地面上，明日香转身及时目睹了一排街道两侧的建筑被粉红色能量鞭切割的景象。
As well as her power cable. The cut end lay sparking on the ground, and with a sound of annoyance Asuka ejected the part still attached. The battery warnings were already back, helpfully reminding her that she had less than five minutes of power remaining until shutdown. She ignored the shouts of the bridge crew. They weren't telling her anything she didn't already know.
还有她的电源线。被切断的一端在地上闪着火花，带着一丝恼怒的声音，明日香将仍连接的部分弹出。电池警告已经再次出现，好心地提醒她，剩余电量不足五分钟就会自动关机。她无视了舰桥人员的呼喊。他们所说的，她早已心知肚明。
"Damn, those whips are nasty," she muttered as the Angel halted. What was probably its head turned left and right, before its entire body spun around to face Unit-01. More buildings were wrecked as both its tail and whips smashed and cut through them.
"该死，那些鞭子真狠毒，"她低声咒骂道，此时使徒停了下来。它那可能是头部的部分左右转动，随后整个身体旋转过来，正面对着初号机。更多的建筑物在它的尾巴和鞭子的撞击与切割下化为废墟。
"I think you made it angry. Good job." With all the noise, Asuka couldn't tell if Misato was being sarcastic or not.
"我觉得你把它惹怒了。干得好。" 在嘈杂声中，明日香无法判断美里是否在讽刺。
"Doesn't seem like it can sense me very well," said Asuka. Unit-01 reached behind its back and unclipped the Pallet Rifle. As the Angel reared back and raised its whips, she let off several rounds. They impacted well short of the Angel on an orange wall of hexagons, but the Angel held its position as well as its whips, which were now glowing less harshly.
"它似乎不太能感知到我，" 明日香说道。初号机从背后取下调色板步枪。当使徒后仰并举起鞭子时，她连续发射了几发子弹。子弹击中了使徒前方橙色的六边形墙壁，但使徒保持了位置和鞭子的姿态，现在鞭子的光芒也变得不那么刺眼了。
"Looks like it can't use those whips while it has its AT-Field up."
看起来它在 AT 力场展开时无法使用那些鞭子。
Asuka rolled her eyes at the blond doctor's obvious statement. She slowly moved Unit-01 forward, keeping up the suppressing fire as she advanced. Now that she was running on batteries, she couldn't afford to waste power on trying to neutralise the Angel's AT-Field. She could try and make a run for one of the other power stations, but that would not be easy with an enemy chasing her.
明日香对金发医生的明显言论翻了个白眼。她缓缓推动零号机前进，一边前进一边保持压制火力。由于现在靠电池供电，她不能浪费能量试图中和使徒的 AT 力场。她可以尝试冲向另一个发电站，但在敌人的追逐下这并不容易。
Asuka came to a halt and held out the Pallet Rifle, firing with one hand and ignoring the gradual muzzle climb as she emptied the magazine. When the gun clicked empty, the orange barrier of the Angel's AT-Field vanished and a whip came flying towards her.
明日香停下脚步，单手举起调色板步枪射击，无视逐渐上升的枪口，直到弹匣打空。当枪发出空膛声时，天使的 AT 力场橙色屏障消失了，一条鞭子向她飞来。
Just as planned.
正如计划的那样。
Unit-01's free hand lashed out, grabbing the whip as Asuka dropped the Pallet Rifle. She immediately regretted her decision as pain erupted in her own left hand. It felt like somebody had soaked a steel cable in oil, lit it on fire, then wrapped it around her hand. The sensation only got worse as the trailing end of the whip wrapped around Unit-01's wrist and began eating into the armour there as well.
初号机的自由手猛地伸出，抓住了鞭子，而明日香则丢下了弹药补给枪。她立刻为自己的决定感到后悔，因为她的左手突然传来剧烈的疼痛。那感觉就像有人将一根浸满油的钢缆点燃，然后紧紧缠绕在她的手上。随着鞭子的尾端缠绕在初号机的手腕上，开始侵蚀那里的装甲，痛感愈发加剧。
...Not quite as planned.
计划并未完全如愿。
Fighting through the pain, Asuka reached up to her right shoulder pylon and deployed the Progressive Knife stored there. She thumbed the activation switch and reversed her grip on the knife, then locked the fingers of her left hand around the whip and brought the knife down on it. The effect was instantaneous.
忍着疼痛，明日香伸手摸向右肩的挂载点，启动了那里存放的近战刀。她按下激活开关，反握刀柄，然后用左手紧紧抓住鞭子，挥刀斩下。效果立竿见影。
The Angel screeched in pain and tried to let go of Unit-01's hand, but Asuka dug her heels in and yanked on it. After about ten seconds of playing tug-of-war, the Progressive Knife finally managed to cut through the whip. Unfortunately, the knife had been mangled by its energy and was now nothing more than a useless lump of metal. Asuka huffed in exasperation, then realised she was now flying.
天使尖叫着痛苦地试图放开初号机的手，但明日香却稳住脚步，用力拉扯。经过大约十秒钟的拔河，电浆刀终于切断了鞭子。不幸的是，刀刃因能量耗损而损坏，如今只是一块无用的金属。明日香气愤地哼了一声，随后意识到自己正在飞行。
In a matter of only a few seconds, the Angel had wrapped its remaining whip around Unit-01's leg and hurled the Evangelion over its head. Asuka had just enough presence of mind to twist Unit-01's body in mid-air, hoping to land on its back rather than its head. She had no intention of being the first to learn how a broken neck translated through the neural link.
仅在几秒之内，天使用剩余的鞭子缠住了初号机的腿，并将其甩过头顶。明日香及时反应，在空中扭转初号机的身体，希望背部着地而非头部。她无意成为第一个通过神经连接体验颈部断裂的人。
She just barely managed to succeed as Unit-01 slammed back-first into a hill on the outskirts of Tokyo-3, the impact knocking the breath out of her. Asuka groaned and shifted the Evangelion's arms, making to stand back up.
她勉强成功地让初号机背部撞向了东京 3 号郊外的一座小山，撞击让她喘不过气来。明日香呻吟着，挪动着福音战士的手臂，试图重新站起来。
"Wait! Don't move, Asuka!"
等等！别动，明日香！
"Huh?" She glanced around at Misato's warning. The Angel was still in the city, paying no attention to her as its partially-amputated whip flailed about.
"嗯？" 她听到碇真嗣的警告后环顾四周。使徒仍在城市中，对其部分截断的触手四处挥舞，对她毫不在意。
"There are civilians right next to you!"
你旁边就有平民！
"Oh come on," Asuka groaned as she looked around again, this time focusing on the hill she'd landed on. Sure enough, there were two people on the hill as well, right where she had been about to place her Evangelion's somewhat-charred left hand. She zoomed her view in, then immediately growled as she recognised the pair.
"哦，拜托，" 明日香嘟囔着再次环顾四周，这次她的注意力集中在她所降落的那个小山上。果然，小山上也有两个人，就在她正准备将她的福音战士那略微烧焦的左手放下的地方。她放大了视野，随即低吼一声，认出了那两个人。
Suzuhara and Aida, the idiotic duo. Aida even had a camera hanging around his stupid neck.
铃原和相田，这对愚蠢的搭档。相田那个笨蛋脖子上甚至还挂着相机。
"Are you fucking kidding me?!"
你他妈在逗我吗？！
"Asuka, it's not safe for them here. You'll need to pick them up."
明日香，这里对他们来说不安全。你需要去接他们。
With a disbelieving look directed at Misato through her comm window, Asuka said, "What, you want me to hold them in my hand while I fight the Flying Purple People Eater?"
透过通讯窗口难以置信地看着美里，明日香说道：“什么，你要我在与飞天紫人食客战斗时，手里还拿着它们？”
Misato looked like she was about to chuckle, but Ritsuko cut in, giving the captain a disapproving look. "No, you'll need to partially eject your entry plug and bring them in. Be quick, you only have three minutes left."
美里看起来差点笑出声，但律子插话进来，给了队长一个不赞成的眼神。“不，你需要部分弹出插入栓并将它们带进来。动作要快，你只剩下三分钟了。”
Asuka let out a spiky German curse as the LCL drained. "Got anything to make sure that Angel doesn't come over here while I'm helpless?"
当 LCL 液体排出时，明日香忍不住吐出了一句带刺的德语脏话。“有没有什么办法能确保那个使徒不会趁我无助时过来？”
"What do you think?"
你怎么看？
She lurched in her seat as the entry plug moved. As the hatch opened she could hear gunfire and explosions, and quickly worked out what the distraction was. Now that the Angel was in the city, the static defenses could pound it from all sides, while it could only defend from one.
她随着插入栓的移动猛地一晃。舱门打开时，她听到了枪声和爆炸声，迅速判断出了干扰的来源。既然使徒已进入城市，静态防御可以从四面八方对其进行打击，而它只能防御一面。
Activating the external speakers, Asuka took a deep breath. "Hey! Erkan and Stefan! Get your dumb asses over here right now!" She leaned back in her seat and folded her arms. Fortunately she didn't have to wait long, as she soon heard the sound of two morons scrambling into the entry plug. The plug quickly reinserted itself and began to fill with LCL once more. Behind her, she heard two gasps of surprise.
激活外部扬声器后，明日香深吸一口气。“嘿！埃尔坎和斯特凡！赶紧把你们的蠢屁股挪过来！”她靠回座位，双臂交叉。幸运的是，她没等多久，很快就听到了两个笨蛋冲进插入栓的声音。插入栓迅速重新插入，并再次开始填充 LCL。在她身后，传来了两声惊讶的喘息。
"The liquid is breathable," she said without looking back. "Now sit down, shut up and hang on."
这种液体是可以呼吸的，"她头也不回地说，"现在坐下，闭嘴，抓紧了。
Suzuhara began to speak. "What the he-"
铃原开始说话了："这到-"
"I said shut up! Just by being in here you're interfering with my ability to pilot!"
我说闭嘴！光是待在这里，你就已经干扰到我驾驶了！
They thankfully went silent.
幸好他们安静了下来。
"Right, time to get back into the fight," Asuka muttered to herself as Unit-01 got back to its feet. As expected from having two other people in the plug, her movement was more sluggish now. She turned her attention to the comm screen. "I'm going to need a new power cable. Can't fight on battery power like this."
好的，是时候重新投入战斗了，" 明日香自言自语道，同时零号机重新站了起来。不出所料，驾驶舱内多了两个人，她的动作现在更加迟缓了。她将注意力转向通讯屏幕。"我需要一根新的电源线。不能就这样靠电池战斗。
"Marking a power station on your HUD now."
正在你的 HUD 上标记一个发电站。
"How about another weapon while you're at it? Something with a bit more punch? Melee combat's out of the question with this dead weight dragging my sync down."
再拿一件武器怎么样？来点更有威力的？带着这个累赘，近战根本不可能，它拖慢了我的同步速度。
"Sending you another waypoint. Heavy ordnance is waiting for you there."
再给你发送一个路标。那里有重型军火等着你。
Asuka almost responded with glee, but a sharp intake of breath behind her caused her to roll her eyes as she set Unit-01 in motion towards the power station. A short stop there halted the battery alarms again, and she then took off for the armoury building. As it opened to reveal its contents, she paused in slight confusion and heard a high pitched noise from behind her.
明日香几乎要高兴地回应，但身后突然的吸气声让她翻了个白眼，随即启动零号机向发电站驶去。短暂停留后，电池警报再次停止，她接着前往军械库。当大门打开展示其内部时，她略显困惑地停顿了一下，并听到身后传来一阵尖锐的声响。
"There's... two rocket launchers here."
这里...有两支火箭筒。
"Is that a complaint?" Misato asked.
"那是抱怨吗？" 碇真嗣问道。
"Nope," Asuka replied as she collected her new best friends. Two matching rocket launchers, designed to rest on an Evangelion's shoulder, with two visible rockets loaded into each. "Guided or dumbfire?"
不是，" 明日香回答着，同时收集她的新挚友——两把匹配的火箭发射器，设计用于放置在福音战士的肩上，每把发射器中都装有两枚可见的火箭。"是制导的还是无制导的？
Before anybody in NERV could respond, somebody in the entry plug got there first.
在 NERV 的任何人做出反应之前，插入栓中已经有人率先行动了。
"Rocket launchers are dumbfire," said Aida.
"火箭发射器是直射的，"艾达说道。
Asuka growled and roughly flicked a hand behind her, smiling slightly at the yelp of pain that caused.
明日香低吼一声，粗暴地向后挥了挥手，听到随之而来的痛苦呜咽，她微微一笑。
"Yes they're dumbfire, but you have the Eva's targeting system to help you aim. Just aim and shoot where and when it tells y-... Wait, are you going to use both at once?!"
是的，它们是直射的，但你有 Eva 的瞄准系统帮助你瞄准。只需按照指示瞄准并射击——等等，你打算同时使用两个吗？！
Asuka was already in the process of readying both launchers on the Evangelion's shoulders.
明日香已经在准备安装在福音战士肩膀上的两个发射器。
"Yep."
嗯。
A sigh came over the comm channel from Ritsuko. "Very well. I'll patch the MAGI in to help your targeting computer. It can handle that just fine. Let's just hope you can."
通讯频道中传来律子的一声叹息：“好吧，我会让 MAGI 接入你的瞄准计算机，它处理这个完全没问题。只希望你也能行。”
The Second Child smiled. Challenge so accepted.
第二适格者微笑着，接受了这个挑战。
Two crosshairs imposed themselves on the HUD, showing where the launchers were currently aiming. Asuka grinned and headed towards the expanding cloud of smoke and debris that marked the point that the static defenses were shooting at. As Unit-01 drew near, some of the emplacements slackened and ceased, so as not to hit a friendly target. Asuka switched view modes, shifting to infrared rather than waiting for the smoke to disperse. There, still in the centre, was the Angel. Two white-hot lines of heat showed that it had managed to regrow its missing whip. But the important part of the target, the core, was only moderately red. Still, that was enough.
两个十字瞄准线在 HUD 上显现，指示着发射器当前的瞄准位置。明日香咧嘴一笑，朝着那团不断扩大的烟雾和碎片冲去，那里正是静态防御系统射击的目标点。随着初号机接近，一些防御设施放缓并停止了射击，以免误伤友军。明日香切换了视角模式，转而使用红外线探测，而不是等待烟雾散去。在那里，依然位于中心位置的，是那只天使。两条炽热的白线表明它已经成功再生了缺失的鞭子。但关键的目标部位——核心，只是呈现出中等的红色。尽管如此，这已经足够了。
The MAGI started to do their thing, showing Asuka the precise point she had to put her crosshairs on, and Unit-01 kneeled down as she concentrated on shifting two launchers towards the aim point. Having two idiots in the entry plug paradoxically seemed to help, as the lowered sync dulled the twitches in the Evangelion's arms as she made minor corrections.
MAGI 开始发挥作用，向明日香显示了她必须将准星对准的确切位置，而初号机则跪下，她集中精力将两个发射器转向瞄准点。驾驶舱内有两个笨蛋反而起到了意想不到的帮助，降低的同步率减弱了福音战士手臂在微调时的颤动。
As the smoke started to clear, Asuka saw the Angel begin to look around and knew she had to be quick. She squeezed the triggers. Both launchers lit off at almost the same time, sending two rockets streaking through the sky towards her target.
烟雾开始散去，明日香看到使徒开始四处张望，意识到自己必须迅速行动。她紧扣扳机，两台发射器几乎同时点火，两枚火箭划破天际，直奔目标而去。
Unfortunately, the slight recoil of the first launcher threw the aim of the right off by a minuscule amount. The crosshair barely twitched, but at the distance separating Asuka and her target, it was enough to rob her of what would have likely been a clean kill.
不幸的是，第一台发射器轻微的后坐力使得右边的瞄准偏移了微小的一点。准星只是轻微颤动，但在明日香与目标之间的距离上，这足以让她错失了本可能干净利落的一击。
The left rocket hit the core directly, heavily cracking it. The right impacted against the Angel's flesh above the core and below its 'neck', blasting a massive hole in it. The Angel shrieked in pain and fell to the ground, spilling blood as its thrashing tail and whips churned the debris around it.
左侧火箭直接命中核心，重创其外壳。右侧火箭则击中天使生物核心上方、颈部下方的肉质部位，炸出一个巨大的洞。天使痛苦尖叫，倒地挣扎，血液随着其甩动的尾巴和鞭状肢体四溅，搅动周围的碎片。
"Fuck yes!" Asuka crowed, lowering the rocket launchers.
"太棒了！" 明日香欢呼道，同时放下了火箭发射器。
"Not dead yet," came the soft voice of Aida from behind her.
"还没死呢，" 身后传来绫波的轻声细语。
"Shut it!" she yelled as she turned to glare at him.
"闭嘴！"她吼道，同时转过身来怒视着他。
"It's getting back up."
它又站起来了。

"Huh?" She turned back, to see that the nerd was right. Even with the damage it had just sustained, the Angel was already starting to heal; the hole above its core was filling in. "Shit."
咦？" 她转过头，发现那个书呆子果然没说错。尽管刚受了伤，天使的身体已经开始自我修复，核心上方的破洞正慢慢愈合。"糟糕。

Unit-01 lifted the launchers again, but there was no time for aiming. The Angel was already floating quickly towards her.
单元 01 再次举起发射器，然而已无暇瞄准。使徒正快速逼近她。

"Wait until it gets closer, fire, then flank it while it's in the smoke!"
等它再近一些，开火后，趁烟雾弥漫时绕到它侧翼！

Asuka resisted the urge to turn around and punch the wannabe back seat pilot. "If I wanted advice I'd beat it out of you. I've got ten years of Eva training under my belt."
明日香抑制住回身给那个自作聪明的后排指挥者一拳的冲动。“真要听建议，我会揍你一顿让你吐出来。我可是有十年驾驶 Eva 的经验。”

The Angel picked up speed.
天使加速了。

"Do it!" 行动起来！

"Ugh! If this doesn't work, I'm going to say I told you so. By putting my foot up your ass!"
哎！要是这招不灵，我可得说‘我早就提醒过你了’。小心我一脚踹你屁股上！

When the Angel was only a few hundred meters away, its whips cutting through anything nearby, Asuka fired. The pair of rockets struck the angel in its bulbous head, blasting away more chunks of flesh. The Angel dropped to the ground, and Asuka could hear it shrieking like a banshee even inside the entry plug.
当使徒逼近至数百米时，其触手肆虐周围，明日香果断发射。两枚火箭精准命中使徒那肿大的头部，炸裂出大量血肉。使徒轰然倒地，即便在插入栓内，明日香也能听到它那如女妖般凄厉的尖叫声。

"Huh, it didn't put that shield thing up," Aida remarked. "This works just as well though."
哎呀，那个护盾没展开，" 艾达说道，"不过这样也挺管用的。

"Yeah? Well what now, genius? I'm out of ammo," Asuka said as she dropped the launchers.
"哦？那接下来你有什么高招，天才？我的弹药已经耗尽了，"明日香一边说着，一边将发射器丢弃。

"Use your knife." 用你的刀。

"That's both broken and nowhere near here!"
那东西坏了，而且离这儿远得很！

"Two pylons, two knives."
两个高压塔，两把刀。

Asuka almost shouted at him for his idiocy, before remembering one important detail about Unit-01: it didn't have a spike launcher. With mounting hope, she raised the Evangelion's left arm...
明日香差点因他的愚蠢而对他大吼，却突然记起零号机的一个关键特性：它并未装备尖刺发射器。满怀希望，她缓缓举起了这台使徒的左臂...

The left pylon opened and the handle of a Progressive Knife jutted out.
左侧塔架开启，一把渐进式刀的把手突显出来。

"Huh. Two knives." Asuka raised both eyebrows and gave an impressed hum, before a smile that would have made a shark envious grew on her face. "Time to end this."
哦？两把刀啊。" 明日香双眉一扬，发出一声赞叹，随即脸上露出了一个连鲨鱼都会嫉妒的笑容。"该收场了。

Now that she was much closer, Asuka had no trouble jumping onto the Angel's back and wrapping an arm around its neck, lifting it partially off the ground. The whips flailed about, occasionally striking Unit-01 and delivering painful welts, but Asuka held firm. The Progressive Knife flashed in the daytime sun before stabbing deep into the cracked core.
如今距离拉近，明日香轻松跃上使徒背部，单臂紧勒其颈，使其半悬空中。鞭影乱舞，不时抽打零号机，留下痛楚的痕迹，然而明日香坚毅不移。在日光下，前进刀闪耀着寒光，直刺入裂纹密布的核心深处。

"Come on," Asuka growled. She worked the knife back and forth as the Angel started to slowly lift from the ground, taking her with it. Just as it cleared the height of the nearby buildings, she felt the knife slip, and heard the sound she'd been waiting for.
"快点，" 明日香怒吼道。她用力地来回挥动刀子，随着使徒缓缓升空，她也一同被带起。当它刚超过周围建筑的高度时，她感觉到刀子一滑，随即听到了期待已久的声音。

The Angel fell silent as the core broke apart, before plummeting to the ground.
天使陷入沉默，核心碎裂后，坠落至地面。

Even the sudden landing did nothing to damage Asuka's good cheer. She stood Unit-01 up, then leaned back in her chair and let out a breath she hadn't known she was holding. "Well, maybe you're not as dumb as you look, sound and act."
即使突然着陆，阿苏卡的好心情也丝毫未受影响。她操控零号机站稳，然后靠回椅背，长舒一口气，原来自己一直屏着呼吸。“看来，你并不像看起来、听起来和表现出来的那么笨嘛。”

"Thanks, I-... Hey!" 谢谢，我...嘿！

Asuka grinned at the nerd's indignation, and sighed happily before tilting her head towards the comm screen. "So, how'd I do on my very first combat op?"
明日香看着那个书呆子气愤的样子，不禁咧嘴一笑，随后满足地叹了口气，把头转向通讯屏幕。"我这第一次战斗任务，表现怎么样？"

On the comm screen, Misato was clearly just as pleased as her. "One very dead Angel. Would have been nice if you'd killed it outside the city, but it's fine." She had to raise her voice a bit to be heard over the bridge technicians. The two males were high-fiving each other.
通信屏幕上，碇真嗣的喜悦之情溢于言表，与她不相上下。"一个彻底被消灭的天使。要是能在城外解决它就更好了，不过现在这样也行。"为了盖过桥上技术人员的嘈杂声，她不得不提高嗓门。那两位男性正兴奋地互相击掌庆祝。

"Want me to drag it out there?"
需要我把它拖出去吗？

Misato quickly consulted with Ritsuko. "Yes, if you can. That would save us a bit of time, and it means we won't have to cordon half the city off."
真嗣迅速与美里商讨。“对，如果你能行的话。这样能为我们省下一些时间，也不用封锁半个城市了。”

"Leave the remains of the core where they are," Ritsuko interjected. "A team will be picking them up."
核心残余就留在原处，" 律子打断说，"会有团队来处理的。

"Roger that," Asuka replied as she hoisted the dead Angel up. It was not nearly as heavy as it appeared. Was it full of lighter-than-air gas? She decided it didn't matter as she walked her kill out beyond the hill she'd landed on. There was a nice deep imprint of an Evangelion there now. "Here fine?"
明白，" 明日香应声道，随即举起那死去的使徒。它远比想象中轻，或许是充盈着轻于空气的气体？她觉得这无关紧要，便拖着战利品越过了降落的山丘。那里，一个 EVA 的深痕已然烙下。"这里合适吗？

"Perfect. Set it down and head back to the catapult." Misato's expression turned serious. "Oh, and there'll be some people waiting to have a chat with your... passengers."
很好。把它放下，然后返回投石机。" 碇真嗣的表情变得严肃。"对了，还有些人等着要和你的...乘客们谈谈。

Asuka heard the sound of two nearly identical nervous gulps behind her. She grinned and said, "Sorry Shinji, you might not be seeing your nerd friend for a while."
明日香听到背后传来两声几乎一模一样的紧张吞咽声。她嘴角上扬，说道：“真嗣，不好意思，你可能得有一阵子见不到你的书呆子朋友了。”

There was no response. 没有任何回应。

"Shinji?" 真嗣吗？

Misato and Ritsuko looked around. Behind them, Rei was standing by herself, gazing stoically up at the holographic screen with her arms hanging loosely at her sides. Misato rushed out of camera shot, presumably to check the hall outside, before slowly returning with a look of abject confusion on her face.
美里和律子四下张望。在他们身后，绫波独自一人静静站立，面容沉静地仰望着全息屏幕，双臂放松地垂在身旁。美里急忙跑出画面，应是去查看走廊外的情况，随后又慢慢回来，脸上写满了困惑不解。

### Chapter 07 Why Am I Still Here?

Shinji awoke with a start, and stared up at what was above him. Since coming to Tokyo-3, there had been several times when he'd woken up in a strange room, but this one was stranger than ever.
真嗣猛然惊醒，抬头凝视着上方。自从来到第三新东京市，他已数次在陌生的房间中醒来，但这一次的房间尤为诡异。
'Unfamiliar... really high ceiling?'
陌生的...真的好高的天花板？
He sat up and looked around, trying to rub the sleep out of his eyes. Rows of seats stretched out on both sides of him, all facing towards the same wall that was bordered by red curtains. His brain finally switched on.
他坐起身来，环顾四周，试图揉去眼中的睡意。一排排座位在他两侧延伸，全都面向那面镶着红帘的墙壁。他的大脑终于开始运转。
Shinji had left the Geofront, and hadn't found it the least bit surprising that nobody had paid much attention to him. Presumably, the personnel were focused on the after-action procedures and had thought he was cleared to leave.
真嗣离开了地下都市，对于无人过多关注他这一点，他丝毫不感到惊讶。想必工作人员正忙于善后工作，认为他已经获准离开。
Or maybe they too knew he wasn't worth bothering with.
或许他们也明白，他不值得费心。
With Asuka's victory over the Angel, it was absolutely clear NERV didn't require Shinji Ikari; it was time for him to leave. At first he had decided to go straight to the apartment to pack his things, but he hadn't wanted to risk the awkwardness of running into Asuka or Misato. In the meantime, he had needed to find somewhere to wait. It was Friday, so there would be school the next day; he could sneak in while his roommate was out.
随着明日香战胜使徒，显然 NERV 不再需要碇真嗣；他该离开了。起初他打算直接回公寓收拾东西，但又不想冒险碰见明日香或美里而尴尬。于是，他得找个地方暂避。那天是周五，次日还有课，他可以趁室友不在时悄悄溜进学校。
'Oh right, I went to a cinema,' he remembered. 'Nobody was here, but they seemed to have forgotten to turn the projectors off. Not surprising considering the suddenness of the attack.'
“哦对，我去了电影院，”他回忆道，“那里空无一人，但似乎他们忘记关掉放映机了。考虑到袭击的突然性，这并不奇怪。”
That had at least helped to pass the time, and the still-warm popcorn in the machine had been enough to stop his stomach rumbling once he worked out how to dispense it. He must have fallen asleep while watching a several-hour-long story about... something. Shinji got to his feet and stretched, wincing at the crick in his neck as he headed for the lobby. What time was it now? He didn't have his phone with him; that was back in the Geofront sitting securely in his school bag, probably still right where he'd put it on the floor on the NERV bridge. Looking around the lobby, he saw a clock that proclaimed it was just after five in the morning. Outside, the sun was starting to turn the sky reddish-orange.
至少这打发了时间，机器里尚有余温的爆米花足以平息他肚子的咕噜声，一旦他弄明白如何取出它们。他必定是在观看某个长达数小时的故事时睡着了。真嗣站起身，伸展了一下，走向大厅时因颈部的僵硬而皱眉。现在几点了？他没带手机；那东西还安全地躺在他的书包里，大概仍在 NERV 总部桥面上的原位。环顾大厅，他看到一个时钟显示刚过清晨五点。外面，太阳正开始将天空染成红橙色。
Speaking of which, Asuka was probably aware of his absence by now.
说到这个，明日香现在可能已经察觉到他的缺席了。
Asuka...
明日香...
Shinji heaved a sigh. It would be better for Asuka if he wasn't around to distract her from her duty. After all, she was the skilled pilot; no way she would fall on her face and get the crap beaten out of her. And she had Rei now, as both a friend and fellow pilot. Asuka's Evangelion would eventually arrive, so she would switch to that, and Rei would perhaps transfer to Unit-01. They could both go on to save the world without him getting in the way.
真嗣叹了口气。如果他不在这里分散明日香的注意力，对她来说会更好。毕竟，她才是技艺高超的驾驶员；绝不会出丑挨打。而且她现在有了绫波，既是朋友也是同僚驾驶员。明日香的福音战士终将抵达，届时她会换乘，而绫波或许会转乘零号机。她们俩可以继续拯救世界，无需他碍手碍脚。
As he stepped out of the cinema, Shinji paused and thought things over. He would need to find somewhere to wait until the apartment was definitely empty. Looking around, he saw a train drawing close to a nearby station. He didn't know where it was going, but it didn't matter right now; he just felt like he needed to be moving. Shinji patted his pockets and sighed in relief. Though he had left his school bag in the Geofront, he still had both his NERV identity card, which also doubled as a public transport pass, and his SDAT. That would help the time pass.
走出电影院的那一刻，真嗣停下脚步，深思熟虑。他得找个地方等待，直到公寓确信无人。环顾四周，一列火车正缓缓驶入附近的站台。他不清楚列车驶向何方，但此刻这并不重要；他只是觉得需要动起来。真嗣轻拍口袋，松了口气。尽管将书包遗留在了 Geofront，他仍持有 NERV 身份卡——亦可作为公共交通通行证，以及他的 SDAT 播放器。这些将助他消磨时光。
The train doors closed behind Shinji, and he scanned his card before heading to a seat. His SDAT's earphones had somehow gotten hideously tangled up, and it took a minute to untangle them before he could put them in his ears and turn the device on. The familiar tune of track twenty-five filled his mind, and as Shinji relaxed into his seat, he wondered why the female singer's voice was so familiar.
新治走进车厢后，车门随之关闭，他刷了卡便找了个座位坐下。不知怎的，他的 SDAT 耳机缠绕得一团糟，费了一番功夫才解开，戴上耳机并启动设备。熟悉的第二十五首曲子在脑海中响起，新治靠在座位上，心中纳闷为何那位女歌手的嗓音如此耳熟。
Time passed, as did the scenery outside the train window. Mostly dull concrete buildings, but there were occasional gaps filled with either greenery or water. Shinji didn't know where he was anymore, but he was starting to get hungry. Popcorn could only do so much. Shinji stood up and headed for the nearest door, resolving to get off at the next stop. A restaurant was out of the question; he wondered if there was a fast food pl-
时间流逝，窗外的景色也随之变换。大多是单调的混凝土建筑，间或有些空隙被绿意或水域填补。真嗣已经不知道自己身处何方，饥饿感开始袭来。爆米花毕竟填不饱肚子。他站起身，朝最近的门走去，决定在下一站下车。餐厅是不用想了，他琢磨着附近是否有快餐店——
"Ikari?"
"怒り？"
Shinji blinked in confusion, before looking to the left. Kensuke Aida was standing there, dressed in camouflage gear and carrying a massive bag on his back, with a slightly smaller one in his hand.
真嗣困惑地眨了眨眼，然后向左看去。相田剑介站在那里，身穿迷彩服，背着一个巨大的背包，手里还提着一个稍小一点的包。
"Aida? What are you doing here?" Shinji asked.
"相田？你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。
Aida pointed to his backpack. "School got cancelled today because of the attack, so I decided to go camping. What about you?"
艾达指着他的背包说：“今天学校因为袭击事件停课了，所以我决定去露营。你呢？”
Looking away, Shinji exhaled as he tried to work out what to say. It didn't seem right to burden Aida with his problems.
新二转过头去，深吸一口气，试图想出该说什么。似乎不应该把自己的烦恼加在艾达身上。
"If you don't wanna talk about it, that's fine," said Aida. "I get the feeling you're not just out on an errand, right?" At a nod from Shinji, he grinned. "Why not join me then? I'm always asking Toji to come camping with me, but he never feels like it."
如果你不想谈这个，没关系，"艾达说。"我感觉你不仅仅是出来跑腿的，对吧？"看到真嗣点头，他咧嘴一笑。"为什么不加入我呢？我总是叫东治和我一起去露营，但他从来都不愿意。
"Um... I don't know," Shinji demurred. "Don't you only have enough supplies for yourself?"
嗯...我不知道，"真嗣犹豫地说。"你的补给不是只够你自己用吗？
Aida snorted in amusement. "Are you kidding? 'Be prepared' is my motto. I've got five days worth of rations here!" He lifted the bag he was holding for emphasis. "I could theoretically stretch this out to about seven days depending on where I camp out. Collapsible fishing rod, plus there might be edible flora," he added when Shinji gave him a questioning look.
艾达嗤笑一声，显得很开心。“你在开玩笑吗？‘做好准备’是我的座右铭。我这里备了五天的口粮！”他举起手中的包以示强调。“理论上，如果我选择露营的地方合适，这些食物能撑到大约七天。还有可折叠的钓鱼竿，附近可能还有可食用的植物，”他补充道，因为新二向他投来了询问的目光。
The train stopped, and they both stepped out onto the station platform. The sun was high in the sky now, and the temperature was starting to rise. Shinji thought about simply refusing and walking off to find a vending machine, but the offer was certainly tempting. Since school was cancelled for the day, he'd have to wait a lot longer to ensure the apartment was empty. And maybe getting away from the city entirely would do him some good.
火车停了下来，两人一同踏上了站台。此时太阳高悬，气温开始上升。新二考虑过直接拒绝，然后去找个自动售货机，但这个提议确实很诱人。既然学校今天停课，他得等更久才能确保公寓里没人。或许彻底离开城市对他也有好处。
"Alright," Shinji relented. "I'll join you."
好吧，" 真嗣让步了。"我加入你们。
Aida looked like he was just barely holding back the urge to cheer. His grin was certainly infectious.
相田看起来几乎要忍不住欢呼了。他的笑容确实很有感染力。
"Great! Hey, could you be a pal and carry this please?" He held out the bag that apparently had the food in it.
"太好了！嘿，能帮个忙，帮我拿一下这个吗？" 他伸出手中的袋子，里面显然装着食物。
Shinji almost dropped the bag when it was passed to him. "Are you carrying an anvil in here?!"
真嗣接过袋子时差点没拿稳。"这里面是装了块铁砧吗？！"
"Nope, that's just the weight of being prepared food-wise."
不，这只是为准备食物而感到的负担。
With a grunt of effort, Shinji managed to lift the bag onto his back, thankful that it had straps. Now that his whole body was carrying the load, not just his arm, it seemed much more manageable.
伴随着一声努力的声音，真嗣设法将背包背在了背上，庆幸它有背带。现在他的整个身体都在承担重量，而不仅仅是手臂，这似乎更加容易管理了。
"Right!" declared Aida as he retrieved a map from a side pocket in his backpack. "We've got about forty minutes of walking to get to my planned camping spot. Reckon you can make it?"
对！"艾达宣布道，同时从背包侧袋里掏出一张地图。"我们大概要走四十分钟才能到达我计划的露营地。你觉得你能行吗？
"I'll, uh, do my best," replied Shinji, who was now beginning to regret his decision.
"我，呃，会尽力的，"真嗣回答道，此刻他开始后悔自己的决定。
"Good. Off we go!"
好的，我们出发吧！
Aida practically power walked ahead. Shinji groaned and tried to keep up.
阿依达几乎是以竞走的速度向前走去。真嗣呻吟了一声，努力跟上。
XXX
The view was certainly worth the long walk. Aida had chosen a location practically on the other side of Lake Ashi from the city, relatively close to the water's edge. Thankful to finally be able to set the food bag down, Shinji practically collapsed on the ground.
这景色确实值得长途跋涉。Aida 选择的位置几乎在芦之湖对岸，离城市较远，相对靠近水边。终于能放下食物袋，Shinji 几乎瘫倒在地。
"You're, uh... not very athletic are you?" Aida remarked as he put his bag down, chuckling at a panting Shinji, who could only manage a weak shake of the head in response. "Aren't giant robot pilots supposed to be fit?"
你，呃...不是很擅长运动吧？" 阿伊达边放下包边笑着说，看着气喘吁吁的碇真嗣，后者只能无力地摇了摇头作为回应。"驾驶巨型机器人的驾驶员不是应该很健康吗？
Shinji's face darkened. "I'm not a pilot."
真嗣的脸色沉了下来。“我不是驾驶员。”
Aida paused with one hand in his bag and turned to give him a look of puzzlement. "What? Yes you are. You fought the first monster didn't you?"
绫波停下手中的动作，一手还放在包里，转过身来，带着困惑的表情看着他。“什么？不，你是。你不是和第一个怪兽战斗过吗？”
"Only because it was either me or a crippled Ayanami." Shinji finally managed to sit up, and he sighed. It seemed the only way to get this nosy person off his case was to tell the truth. "I was only an absolute last-minute resort. Afterwards, when I went through the training, it turned out I wasn't suitable. That's why Asuka's here. NERV had to bring her in to replace me. They haven't even given me any training since she arrived."
只是因为要么是我，要么是一个残疾的绫波。" 碇真嗣终于坐了起来，叹了口气。看来，要让这个爱管闲事的人不再纠缠，唯一的办法就是说实话。"我只是一个绝对迫不得已的选择。后来，当我接受训练时，发现我并不合适。这就是为什么明日香会在这里。NERV 不得不把她带来替换我。自从她来后，他们甚至没有给我任何训练。
"Oh... ooohhhh..." Aida had the decency to look sheepish at what his inquisitiveness had revealed. But his sheepishness was quickly trampled by his fascination with the giant robots. "Reckon I'd be suitable? Could you ask whoever's in charge?"
哦...哦哦..." 相田有自知之明地显得有些尴尬，因为他的好奇心揭露了这些。但他的尴尬很快就被对巨型机器人的迷恋所取代。"你觉得我合适吗？你能问问负责人吗？
Shinji snorted. "Let's just get this campsite set up."
真嗣哼了一声。“我们先把营地搭起来吧。”
As they worked, Aida talked about what had happened when he and Suzuhara had gotten out of the Evangelion. Section Two had been waiting for them, marching them off deep into NERV and into a cell. A couple of hours had passed, then they had been marched into a dark room and interrogated for several more hours. Kensuke's camera had been confiscated, even though he had only been using it for the zoom function to watch the fight, then they had been marched out of the Geofront and unceremoniously dumped back in Tokyo-3.
在干活的同时，相田讲述了他们从福音战士中出来后发生的事情。第二分队一直在等他们，将他们带入 NERV 深处并关进牢房。几个小时过去了，然后他们被带进一个昏暗的房间，接受了数小时的审讯。即使只是为了用变焦功能观看战斗，洞木光的相机还是被没收了，之后他们被带出第三新东京市地底都市，不体面地丢回了第三新东京市。
"Why were you even there in the first place?" Shinji had to ask, as he began to hammer a tent peg into the ground.
"你一开始为什么会在那里？" 新二边问边开始将帐篷钉敲入地面。
"Because I wanted to watch," replied Aida, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "And even with everything that happened, it was so worth it."
因为我想看，"艾达回答道，仿佛这是世界上最显而易见的事情。"尽管发生了那么多事，但这一切都太值得了。
"Yeah, Asuka was great out there."
是啊，明日香在那里表现得真棒。
"Sure was. Of course, I did help out a bit."
当然是的。当然，我也帮了点忙。
Shinji swung the peg mallet one last time, before letting it drop to the ground as he ran the back of his other hand across his forehead. Setting up a tent was tough work, especially after a long walk carrying a heavy load.
真嗣挥动木槌最后一击，随后任其落地，用另一只手背擦了擦额头。搭建帐篷是件辛苦活，尤其是在背着沉重行囊长途跋涉之后。
"Why the heck were you giving advice anyway?" he asked. "We've already got a tactical officer."
你到底为什么要给出建议呢？"他问道，"我们已经有战术官了。
After finishing his own tent peg, Aida turned to Shinji. "I wanted to help. I was observing the battle, and I did notice things about the Angel. Like how it wasn't able to keep track of Asuka after she jumped."
在完成自己的帐篷钉后，绫波转向真嗣说：“我想帮忙。我观察了战斗，确实注意到了关于使徒的一些事情。比如它无法在明日香跳跃后追踪到她。”
"Asuka's not stupid, she noticed that too."
明日香不傻，她也注意到了。
"I'm not saying she is. Anyway, my suggestion near the end of the fight was basically to throw up another smoke screen and get out of the way so she could ambush the Angel while it was trying to find her." Aida shrugged. "I guess it had gone berserk or something, because it didn't bother to protect itself like I predicted. Throwing all caution to the wind to try and kill a major threat. Then Asuka... slit its throat or something after it fell to the ground. I couldn't really see what she was doing, but I heard something about a core?"
我不是说她就是那样。总之，战斗快结束时我的建议基本上是再放一个烟幕弹，然后躲开，让她趁天使寻找她时进行伏击。" 绫波丽耸了耸肩。"我猜它可能已经狂暴了或者怎样，因为它没有像我预料的那样保护自己。不顾一切地试图消灭一个重大威胁。然后明日香...在它倒地后割了它的喉咙或者做了什么。我没能看清楚她在做什么，但我听到提到了一个核心？
Shinji shook his head at the hopeful look on Kensuke's face. "I'm pretty sure if I told you anything, we'd both be in trouble."
真嗣对着健介脸上期待的表情摇了摇头。"我很确定，如果我告诉你任何事，我们俩都会有麻烦。"
"Aw c'mon!"
哎呀，拜托了！
"No."
不行。
XXX
The tent and the folding chairs were set up, there was wood ready for a fire, and now Shinji and Aida were enjoying a well-earned rest while looking out over the lake. The only noise around them was the ambient sounds of the woods. Wind rustling the trees, the chirping of birds, and the faint lapping of water against the shore. Shinji felt relaxed for the first time in a long time.
帐篷和折叠椅已经搭好，柴火也准备妥当，此刻，真嗣和绫波正享受着来之不易的休息，眺望着湖面。周围唯一的声响是森林的背景音：风吹动树叶的沙沙声、鸟儿的鸣叫，以及湖水轻拍岸边的微弱声响。真嗣感到久违的放松。
"So what do you come out here for, Aida?" he asked. "I can't imagine you sitting and fishing all day."
“绫波，你来这里是为了什么呢？”他问道，“我无法想象你整天坐着钓鱼的样子。”
"First off, you can call me Kensuke." The boy adjusted his glasses. "I think we've reached that point, don't you?"
首先，你可以叫我健介。" 男孩调整了一下眼镜，"我想我们已经到了那个地步，你不觉得吗？
"Yeah, I guess so."
嗯，我想是的。
"Secondly, I come out here for war games."
其次，我来这里是为了参加战争游戏。
Shinji turned his head and gave Kensuke a blank look. "War games? You mean that thing where two groups fight a mock battle?"
碇真嗣转过头，对剑介投以茫然的目光。“战争游戏？你是说那种两组人进行模拟战斗的活动吗？”
"Precisely."
正是如此。
Blinking several times as he tried to wrap his head around this, Shinji asked, "Where's the other group then?" He froze. "Er... are we going to..."
他眨了几次眼，试图理解这一切，然后问道：“那另一组人呢？”他突然僵住了。“呃……我们是要……”
"No no no," Kensuke replied, waving his hands in negation. "I come out here on my own, to fight a war against my imagination!"
“不不不，”健介回答道，挥手否认。“我独自一人来到这里，是为了与我的想象作战！”
"Oh. Um..."
哦，嗯……
"That probably sounds more boring than it is. Anyway, I'm not gonna do that this time. You seem like you need to relax and get your head straightened out. That's why I brought us to this spot." Kensuke waved a hand in front of him expansively, as though to highlight their surroundings. "This is the most relaxing spot I use when I'm camping."
那听起来可能比实际情况更无聊。不管怎样，这次我不会那么做。你看起来需要放松一下，理清思绪。这就是为什么我带我们来到这个地方。" 健介挥手在面前划过，仿佛在强调周围的景色。"这是我露营时用来放松的最佳地点。
"...Yeah," Shinji replied, staring at the water. Though Japan was heading towards the hottest part of the year, the shade of the tall trees plus a cool breeze coming off the lake made it tolerable, almost comfortable. "It's really something."
...嗯，" 真嗣回答道，凝视着水面。尽管日本正迎来一年中最热的时期，但高大的树木投下的阴影加上湖面吹来的凉风，使得这里还能忍受，甚至有些舒适。"真是不可思议。
The sound of cicadas filled the air. Kensuke looked around as one began to make noise very close to them.
蝉鸣声充斥着四周。健介环顾四周，一只蝉开始在他们附近鸣叫。
"Man, they seem to be getting louder every day," he remarked. "When I was younger you barely heard them at all."
天啊，它们似乎一天比一天吵了，" 他评论道，"我年轻的时候，你几乎听不到它们的声音。
"Misato said something about how the ecosystem is starting to return to normal," replied Shinji. "I guess it can only be a good thing that they're getting louder, in a way."
碇真嗣回答说，葛城美里提到过生态系统正开始恢复正常，" 碇真嗣回答说，"我想，从某种意义上来说，它们变得更吵了，也只能是好事。
Kensuke huffed and rolled his eyes, but said nothing more.
健介哼了一声，翻了个白眼，但没再多说什么。
The sun was just barely touching the top of the trees on the west side of the lake when Kensuke got up out of his chair. "I'm going to get a fire going for dinner. You got any preference?"
当健介从椅子上站起来时，太阳刚刚触及湖西侧树木的顶端。“我要去生火准备晚餐了。你有什么偏好吗？”
Shinji had looked through the food bag earlier and discovered that it was mostly full of MREs and tins, which explained how the military buff was able to take five days worth of food with him. He shook his head in response to the question, and Kensuke picked two random containers out of the bag, setting them to one side as he got to work on building a campfire.
真嗣早先翻看过食物袋，发现里面大多是即食口粮和罐头，这才明白军迷是如何带上五天份的食物的。他摇头回应了问题，而剑介则从袋中随意挑出两个容器放在一旁，开始着手搭建营火。
Shinji watched, but Kensuke worked too fast for him to be sure he'd be able to do it himself. Despite the rather warm day, sitting next to the campfire and eating a hot meal was surprisingly comforting. While the MREs weren't exactly top quality food, they were leagues above the school's menu. After dinner, the two teenagers played a few card games by the light of the fire while chatting about school. Eventually, the fire began to die down, and they took that as the cue to turn in.
真嗣在一旁观看，但剑介动作太快，让他不确定自己是否也能做到。尽管天气颇为温暖，坐在营火旁吃着热食却出奇地令人感到舒适。虽说即食口粮并非顶级美食，但比起学校的菜单还是好上许多。晚餐后，两位少年在火光下玩了几局纸牌，边玩边聊学校的事。最终，火势渐弱，他们便以此为信号准备休息。
Kensuke disappeared for a few minutes, and Shinji thought he knew why, but the smug grin on his face seemed odd for a simple bathroom break. His confusion only mounted when Kensuke cryptically stated that he had 'secured the perimeter' before heading into the tent. Shinji spent only a few seconds trying to understand before giving up and doing the same.
健介消失了片刻，真嗣以为自己知道原因，但健介脸上那得意的笑容对于简单的上厕所来说似乎有些奇怪。当健介神秘地声称自己已经“确保了周边安全”后走进帐篷时，真嗣的困惑更甚。他只花了短短几秒钟试图理解，随后便放弃，也跟着进了帐篷。

Morning came, and Shinji was the first to wake up. He left the tent and, despite Kensuke still being asleep, went behind a tree for some morning necessities. Afterwards, he washed his hands in the lake and dried them on his pants, before sitting down at the water's edge to watch the sun rise.
清晨来临，真嗣第一个醒来。他离开帐篷，尽管健介还在睡梦中，他还是走到一棵树后处理早晨的必需事务。之后，他在湖中洗手，并用裤子擦干，然后坐在水边观看日出。
So far it felt like nothing had really changed. Sure, he had become friends with Kensuke, but what was the point? He was about to return to Fujikawa, leaving everybody he'd met in Tokyo-3 behind. Asuka would probably be the only person to stay in contact with him through the internet. Or would she be too busy with NERV and school to continue talking to him, now that the Angels were coming?
到目前为止，一切似乎都没有真正改变。当然，他和健介成了朋友，但这有什么意义呢？他即将回到藤川，把在第三新东京市遇到的所有人都抛在脑后。明日香可能成为唯一一个通过互联网与他保持联系的人。或者，她会因为 NERV 和学校的事务太忙而不再与他交谈，现在使徒即将到来？
Shinji took out his identity card and looked at it, recalling that NERV's pilots apparently got their pay put into an account these cards could access. It was only going to be a matter of time before somebody remembered that he wasn't a pilot and freeze that account. He idly wondered if it would be worth buying a bunch of stuff now, before that happened, but then he remembered that he'd have to carry it all back to Fujikawa. It was going to be awkward enough just carrying his cello again.
真嗣拿出他的身份卡，回想起 NERV 的驾驶员似乎是通过这些卡访问的账户领取薪水。很快就会有人想起他并不是驾驶员，从而冻结那个账户。他漫不经心地想，现在是否值得买一大堆东西，以免那一天到来，但随后他记起，他还得把这些东西都带回藤川。光是再次带着他的大提琴就已经够尴尬的了。
A faint sound caught Shinji's attention, something that sounded like crinkling leaves. He paid it no mind; it was likely just a wild animal foraging for breakfast. As soon as he and Kensuke were both up and about, it would run off-
一阵微弱的声音引起了真嗣的注意，那声音像是树叶的沙沙声。他并未在意，这多半只是觅食的野生动物。一旦他和健介都起床活动，那动物就会跑掉——
Something else reached his ears that couldn't be attributed to an animal; not even Pen-Pen. It was the sound of very loud, very angry, and very familiar swearing.
另一种声音传入他的耳中，那绝非动物所能发出，甚至连企鹅都不可能。那是极其响亮、愤怒且熟悉的咒骂声。
In German.
在德语中。
"...Asuka?" Shinji murmured as he turned his head to look in the direction of the swearing. He couldn't see anything, so he got to his feet and headed that way. It only took a few seconds of walking before he discovered a certain redhead kneeling on the ground, picking something out of the palm of one hand. She glanced up at him and snarled.
"...明日香？" 真嗣低声自语，转头望向咒骂声传来的方向。他什么也没看见，于是站起身，朝那个方向走去。只走了几秒钟，他就发现一个红发女孩跪在地上，正从一只手掌中挑出什么东西。她抬头瞥了他一眼，咆哮起来。
"Who the fuck puts a tripwire near a goddamn campsite?!"
谁他妈的在露营地附近放绊线啊？！
So that was what Kensuke had meant last night about 'securing the perimeter'.
原来这就是昨晚健介所说的“确保周边安全”的意思。

"Um... that was Kensuke," said Shinji. "Apparently he comes out here for war games."
嗯...那是健介，" 真嗣说道。"他似乎是来这里玩战争模拟游戏的。

Asuka sighed heavily and wiped her hand on her school uniform's dress. "Why does that not surprise me? Anyway..." She got to her feet and stalked over to him until they were face to angry face, and stabbed a finger into his chest. "What the fuck is wrong with you, Ikari?! Misato dragged me out here after you. Do you know how inconsiderate you are, making me worry like this?!"
明日香深深叹了口气，用手抹了抹校服裙。"我怎么一点儿也不意外呢？算了……"她站起身，气势汹汹地走到他面前，怒视着他，用手指戳着他的胸口。"你脑子进水了吗，碇？！美里硬拉我出来找你。你有没有想过，你这样让人担心，有多自私？！"

"Worried?" Shinji echoed. "About me?"
担心了？" 真嗣反问道。"是担心我吗？

"Well I wasn't losing any sleep over the performance of the local sports teams!" Asuka retorted. "Misato's in a state too! She stayed up all night trying to help track you down!"
我可没因为本地运动队的表现而睡不着觉！" 明日香反驳说。"美里也是焦头烂额！她彻夜未眠，一直在努力帮你寻找下落！

"Oh. But... why?" 哦，可是...为什么呢？

Some of Asuka's anger vanished at the question as puzzlement swept across her face, before returning in full force. "Why? Why?! Because she's our guardian you dumbass! It's her job to look after us!"
听到这个问题，明日香的怒气有所缓解，脸上闪过困惑，但很快怒火再次燃起。“为什么？为什么？！因为她是我们的监护人，笨蛋！照看我们就是她的责任！”

"Is that all though?" Shinji asked, his voice low. "Just because she has to look after us?"
就这些吗？" 真嗣压低声音问道，"只是因为她得照看我们？

Utter confusion now made its home on Asuka's face. When she next spoke, she was almost as quiet as he had just been. "What the hell is going on in your head, Shinji? Why did you run off like this?"
阿苏卡的脸上此刻满是困惑。她再次开口时，声音轻得几乎和真嗣刚才一样。“真嗣，你脑子里究竟在想些什么？为什么要这样跑掉？”

Shinji turned away and exhaled, rubbing a hand down his face. He took a few steps back towards the lake before swivelling to face Asuka. "Why am I still here?" he asked, throwing his arms out to the side. "Why hasn't Misato sent me back to live with my teacher yet?"
真嗣转过身，深吸一口气，用手揉了揉脸。他后退几步，面向湖水，然后转身看向明日香。“我为什么还留在这里？”他双臂一摊，问道。“美里怎么还没把我送回老师家？”

Asuka put her hands on her hips. "Because you belong here, stupid."
明日香双手叉腰，说道：“你本来就该在这儿，傻瓜。”

"No I don't! I'm not a pilot, I'm not anything!" Shinji practically shouted. It seemed like Asuka just didn't understand. "I was brought here because of an emergency, but it turns out I'm so useless at the job that it'd be dangerous to use me, and as soon as you got here I should have been sent off back to Fujikawa! Instead I'm just sitting around, waiting for the moment when Misato's got enough free time to kick me back there!"
不，我不是！我不是飞行员，我什么都不是！" 真嗣几乎喊了出来。似乎明日香就是无法理解。"我是因为紧急情况被带到这里，结果发现我对这份工作太无能，用我反而危险，你一来我就该被送回藤川！现在我却只是坐等，盼着真嗣什么时候有空把我打发回去！

His tirade sent Asuka reeling back a few steps, but she quickly recovered. "Okay, there is definitely something wrong with you. Misato isn't just keeping you around because it's her job, and she's not going to get rid of you." She moved closer to him. "That big sister act of hers isn't just for show. I wasn't exaggerating when I said she was worried, or that she stayed up all night. I don't think she's even eaten since you disappeared on us."
他的激烈言辞让明日香不由自主地后退了几步，但她迅速稳住了心神。"显然，你有些不对劲。美里留你在身边，并非仅仅因为职责所在，她也不会轻易放弃你。"她向他走近。"她那副大姐大的姿态绝非做作。我之前说她担忧，说她彻夜未眠，绝非夸大其词。自你失踪以来，我怀疑她甚至未曾进食。"

"She... really?" Shinji faltered. He hadn't thought that anybody would have actually been worried about him.
"她...真的吗？" 真嗣一时语塞。他没想到竟然有人真的在担心他。

"Yeah. Which means when we get home you're going to cook something up for her as an apology for making her worry about you."
没错。所以回家后，你得做点什么来向她表示歉意，毕竟让她为你担心了。

"Home...?" 家...吗？

"Home," Asuka repeated. "Where you damn well belong. With us."
‘家’，" 明日香重复道，"你本就该在那儿，和我们在一起。

"What's this, a lover's spat?"
这是怎么了，小两口吵架了？

Shinji and Asuka turned to the source of the Japanese voice. Kensuke was sticking his head out of the tent and looking blearily at them.
真嗣和明日香循声望去，只见剑介从帐篷中探出头，一副睡意朦胧的样子望着他们。

"Didn't know you two were already living together," he remarked. "Does NERV let its employees marry this young?"
没想到你们俩已经同居了，"他惊讶地说。"NERV 允许员工这么年轻就结婚吗？

"Wha- I-" Shinji tried to speak, but Asuka got there first.
"什么-我-" 碇真嗣刚要开口，却被明日香抢了先。

"You perverted moron!" she yelled. "We're roommates, nothing more!"
你这个变态！"她大声说道，"我们不过是室友关系，别无其他！

"You sure don't act like it. It sounded like an old married couple arguing over... whatever it was you were saying in that foreign tongue."
你确实不像那样。听起来就像一对老夫老妻在为...你们用那种外语讨论的任何事情争执。

"Oh, right..." Shinji realised that he and Asuka had been talking entirely in German since she'd shown up. "Um... I was saying that I didn't need to be here anymore since I can't pilot and that I should be getting sent away, and Asuka said that I belong here."
哦，对了..." 真嗣这才发觉，自从明日香到来，他们就一直用德语交流。"嗯... 我之前说的是，既然我已无法驾驶，就不该再留在这里，理应被送走，但明日香却说，我应该留下。

"Well she's right," replied Kensuke. "Just because NERV can't use you as a pilot doesn't mean they don't have something else you can do. And besides, I don't want to see my new friend leave so soon."
她说得没错，" 肯介回应道。"NERV 虽然不能让你当驾驶员，但总有其他你能贡献的地方。再说，我也不希望刚认识的朋友这么快就走。

"There, you see?" said Asuka, gesturing at Kensuke. "Someone else who'd be unhappy if you left."
看，明白了吗？" 阿苏卡指着健介说，"你若离开，也会有人因此感到难过的。

"...I guess," said a sheepish Shinji, awkwardly rubbing the back of his head. "I just... didn't think anybody here cared about me that much."
...我想，" 新二带着几分尴尬地说，不自在地挠着后脑勺。"我只是...没想到这里会有人这么关心我。

"Oh my god, you bloody moron!" Asuka groaned, slapping a hand on her face. "If Misato didn't care, she would have just sent Section Two to drag you back to NERV in chains. If I didn't care, I wouldn't have demanded that Misato drive me all this way just so I could be the one to bring you home."
天哪，你这个笨蛋！" 明日香叹了口气，用手捂住脸。"要是美里不关心，她早就让第二部门用锁链把你押回 NERV 了。要是我不关心，我就不会非要美里开车送我这么远，就为了我能亲自带你回去。

"Er, what?" 嗯？什么意思？

Asuka shook her head. "I'll explain on the way back. Hey Aida!" She turned to Kensuke. "I'm taking this idiot back home."
明日香摇摇头说：“回去的路上我再解释。嘿，相田！”她转向健介，“我得把这个笨蛋送回家。”

"'Kay," Kensuke replied. "I can get back to my war games then."
“好的，”肯尼回答，“那我可以继续玩我的战争游戏了。”

"War games?" Asuka raised an eyebrow and glanced at Shinji. "You mentioned that before. Does he mean that thing where-"
战争游戏？" 明日香挑眉看向真嗣。"你之前提过这事。他是指那个——

"Yes," Shinji interrupted with a shrug. "He fights by himself out here. Or something."
对，" 真嗣插话道，耸了耸肩。"他独自在这里战斗。大概就是这样。

Asuka stared in confusion, before raising her hands in surrender and backing away. As she passed Shinji, she yanked him along by the upper arm. After a few steps she turned and began to walk forward.
明日香一脸困惑，随即举手投降，并缓缓后退。经过真嗣时，她一把抓住他的上臂，拉着他一同前行。几步之后，她转过身，开始向前走去。

Right over the tripwire. 恰好在触发线之上。

"Son of a-" Asuka began to shout, as the two of them got caught up in a tangle of limbs. Shinji twisted them both around so he hit the dirt first with a grunt of pain. He opened his eyes after a moment, to find Asuka's face mere centimetres away, and starting to turn bright red. His own cheeks followed suit as he realised their position.
Asuka 怒吼道：“你这个——”，两人随即陷入肢体纠缠。Shinji 巧妙地扭转身体，让自己先摔在地上，发出一声闷哼。他睁眼一看，Asuka 的脸近在咫尺，正迅速涨红。意识到彼此的尴尬姿势，他的脸颊也跟着泛起红晕。

Behind them, Kensuke snickered. "Heh, sure you're not a married couple? Because you sure look like it right now."
他们身后，健介忍不住笑出声：“喂，你们真的不是夫妻？看你们这模样，简直就像一对儿。”

"You asshole!" Now Asuka's face was turning red for a different reason. She dragged herself and Shinji back to their feet before storming off in a huff. Fortunately, they only heard Kensuke's laughter for a minute before it faded away.
"你这个混蛋！"此刻，明日香的脸色因另一原因涨红。她拉着真嗣重新站起，随即怒气冲冲地离去。所幸，他们只忍受了洞木光那短暂的笑声，随后便归于平静。

Once they were well away from the campsite, Shinji said, "So, um, how did you find me?"
远离营地后，真嗣开口问道：“对了，你是怎么找到我的？”

"You certainly didn't make it easy," said Asuka. "I'll start from the beginning, right after the fight..."
你确实没让事情变得简单，" 明日香说道。"那我就从头开始讲，就在战斗结束之后...

### Chapter 08 I Should Have Realised Sooner

As Unit-01 descended into the depths of the Geofront on the launch catapult, Asuka stretched her arms out and arched her back before glancing behind at her two unwanted passengers.
当零号机沿着发射弹射器深入第三新东京市地下的巨大空间时，明日香伸展双臂，挺直了背，然后回头瞥了一眼她那两位不请自来的乘客。
"Some very serious men are going to have a very serious chat with you two," she remarked.
“几位非常严肃的人士将要和你们两位进行一场非常严肃的谈话。”她评论道。
"Oh, we're in very serious trouble," Suzuhara moaned. "I told ya we shouldna snuck out, Ken!"
“哦，我们这下可真有大麻烦了，”铃原呻吟道，“我早告诉过你，我们不该偷偷溜出来的，阿 Ken！”
"So worth it," Aida replied, seemingly unfazed by his impending interrogation if the grin on his face was anything to go by.
"绝对值得，"艾达回答道，似乎对他的即将到来的审问毫不在意，如果他脸上的笑容能说明什么的话。
"Says you!" Suzuhara held his head in his hands. "I'm tellin' them it was all your idea, since it was!"
"说你呢！" 铃原抱头说道，"我会告诉他们这都是你的主意，因为本来就是！"
Asuka raised an eyebrow. "So why'd you follow him?"
明日香挑了挑眉。“那你为什么跟着他？”
"'Cos I wanted to try and keep him outta trouble, Red." Suzuhara's hands dropped back to his sides as he glared at Aida. "This dumbass told the class rep we were just takin' a leak, then told me he was gonna sneak out ta watch the fight. I didn't want him to end up splatted, so I tagged along to try'n keep him outta trouble!"
"因为我想试着让他远离麻烦，红。" 铃原双手垂回身侧，瞪着相田。"这个蠢货告诉班长我们只是去小便，然后又跟我说他要偷偷溜出去看打架。我不想他最后被打得稀巴烂，所以我就跟着他，试图让他远离麻烦！"
"And look how well that turned out," replied Asuka. "Well you're loyal, I'll give you that."
“看看结果多好，”明日香回答道，“好吧，你很忠诚，这点我承认。”
"Yeah. Thanks," Suzuhara spat. "Now I'm gonna get disappeared by secret agents just because I didn't want my buddy to get hurt."
"是啊，谢了，" 铃原啐了一口，"现在就因为我不想让哥们受伤，我就要被特工给消失了。"
The launch catapult came to a gentle stop at the bottom of the lift shaft. Clamps that were laying in wait for Unit-01 attached themselves to the Evangelion's cradle, and began the slow process of transferring the purple behemoth back to its holding pen.
发射弹射器在升降井底部缓缓停下。一直等待着 Unit-01 的夹具自动附着到福音战士的托架上，开始缓慢地将这紫色巨兽转移回其存放处。
"You don't know that we're gonna get disappeared," said Aida. He turned to Asuka. "...Are we?"
"你不知道我们可能会消失，"艾达说。他转向飞鸟，"...我们真的会吗？"
Asuka thought about trying to scare him, but the success of her first combat operation had left her in a good mood. Still, she wasn't quite sure what would happen to them after what they had witnessed. "You might. Or they might just interrogate you for a while. Just go along with them, don't try anything stupid, and you might get to see tomorrow."
明日香本想试着吓唬他，但初次战斗任务的成功让她心情大好。尽管如此，她仍不确定他们目睹这一切后会有何遭遇。“你可能会。或者他们可能只是审问你一阵子。顺着他们来，别做傻事，或许你还能见到明天的太阳。”
Suzuhara let out a groan of dismay, then a sigh of defeat. "Well if I don't make it out alive, tell my lil' sis I'm sorry I disobeyed her. She warned me not to get in trouble again."
铃原发出了一声沮丧的呻吟，随后是一声认输的叹息。“好吧，如果我没能活着出去，告诉我妹妹我对不起她，我没有听她的话。她警告过我不要再惹麻烦了。”
Unit-01 gently bumped against the back wall of the cage, where massive restraints locked into place around its arms and legs. The armour plate covering the entry plug slid aside, and the plug began to exit the socket.
初号机轻轻地撞上了笼子的后墙，巨大的束缚装置随即在其手臂和腿部锁定到位。覆盖插入栓的装甲板滑开，插入栓开始从插槽中退出。
"You mean your sister that's in hospital?" Asuka inquired as the LCL began to drain. "Oh, by the way, you'll want to breath out as hard as possible to get this stuff out of your lungs."
你是说你住院的妹妹吗？" 随着 LCL 开始排出，明日香问道。"哦，对了，你得尽量用力呼气，把这东西从肺里排出去。
The two boys almost retched as they did so. After a bit of coughing, Suzuhara spoke with anger in his voice.
两个男孩几乎要呕吐出来。一阵咳嗽之后，铃原用愤怒的声音说道。
"Yeah, after your boyfriend almost killed her."
是啊，在你男朋友差点杀了她之后。
Asuka fought down the blush at the label. "He's not my boyfriend. I've just known him for a long time. And the reason your sister got hurt was because NERV didn't have time to train him before the first attack. He got brought in literally at the last minute and didn't even know how to walk." She got out of the pilot seat and glared daggers at Suzuhara. "But he still went out there and defeated the Angel. If it wasn't for him, you and your sister would be dead."
明日香努力压下因这个称呼而泛起的脸红。“他不是我的男朋友。我只是认识他很久了。你姐姐受伤是因为 NERV 没有时间在第一次攻击前训练他。他几乎是最后一刻被拉进来的，甚至不知道怎么走路。”她从驾驶座上站起来，用锐利的目光瞪着铃原。“但他还是出去击败了使徒。如果不是他，你和你姐姐早就死了。”
The angry teenager matched her steely expression, the two of them staring at each other. Behind the boys, the entry plug's hatch opened and a black-suited man leaned in.
愤怒的少年与她冷硬的表情相匹配，两人互相对视。在男孩们身后，插入栓的舱门打开，一个身穿黑衣的男人探身进来。
"You two, come with us," he barked.
"你们两个，跟我们来，"他厉声说道。
Suzuhara held his stare a few seconds longer before blinking and looking away. "We'll talk later, Red," he said before stepping out of the plug, Aida close behind. Asuka let out a sigh as she ran a hand through her LCL-slicked hair. She needed to wash the stuff off before it dried out.
铃原坚持凝视了几秒钟，最终眨了眨眼，移开了视线。"我们稍后再谈，红，"他说完便走出了插入栓，相田紧随其后。明日香叹了口气，用手梳理着被 LCL 浸湿的头发。她得在 LCL 干掉之前把它洗掉。
One ludicrously quick shower later, Asuka headed for the bridge. Though she wanted to take the time for a full wash, something more important needed to be dealt with.
一场荒唐的快速淋浴过后，明日香赶往了舰桥。尽管她本想好好洗个澡，但有更重要的事情需要处理。
XXX
"Where the hell is he?"
他到底在哪儿？
Doctor Akagi and Misato looked up at Asuka as she stomped towards them. Ayanami was also there, but she didn't turn to greet her.
医生赤木和美里抬头看着明日香大步向他们走来。绫波也在那里，但她并没有转头打招呼。
"There's a proper way to speak to a superior officer," Doctor Akagi chidingly said. "That wasn't it."
对上级军官说话有正确的方式，"赤木医生责备地说，"你刚才那不是。
"Oh sure, I'll just waste even more time," Asuka replied sarcastically, glaring at Doctor Akagi, who quirked an eyebrow at her before turning back to the tablet in her hands. Misato simply folded her arms and stared at the disgruntled redhead. Finally, Asuka sighed and snapped off a salute.
"哦，当然，我还要浪费更多时间，" 明日香讽刺地回答道，瞪着赤木博士，后者对她挑了挑眉毛，然后又转回手中的平板。美里只是交叉双臂，盯着不满的红发少女。最终，明日香叹了口气，猛地敬了个礼。
"Captain Katsuragi. Doctor Akagi. Could you please give me any information you have on the disappearance of Shinji Ikari?" She just barely kept her eyes from rolling, and the adults probably sensed that, but both of them relaxed slightly.
"葛城上尉，赤木博士，请问你们能提供关于碇真嗣失踪的任何信息吗？" 她勉强控制住自己不翻白眼，大人们可能察觉到了，但两人都稍微放松了一些。
"That's better," said Misato. "As for your question..." She glanced at Doctor Akagi, who only offered a shrug. "We don't know yet. NERV's main goal right now is clean-up and retrieval of the core."
那好多了，" 碇真嗣说。"至于你的问题……" 她瞥了一眼赤木博士，后者只是耸了耸肩。"我们还不知道。NERV 目前的主要目标是清理和回收核心。
Asuka could hear the frustration in Misato's voice. The woman clearly wanted to be involved in the search, but her own duties prevented her. That was the only reason why Asuka didn't explode in anger at NERV's apparent lack of care.
明日香能听出葛城美里声音中的沮丧。这位女士显然想参与搜寻，但自己的职责使她无法脱身。这也是明日香没有对 NERV 明显缺乏关怀而爆发怒火的原因。
"What about his Section Two detail?" she ground out. "Aren't they supposed to be near him whenever he's out of the Geofront?"
关于他的第二部分细节呢？"她咬牙切齿地说，"他一离开 Geofront，他们不是应该随时在他附近吗？
"The lockdown was only recently released," said Doctor Akagi. "Ikari slipped out beforehand. As a result, all we have to go on right now are cameras. The MAGI are trawling through the footage, and..." She paused. "Ah hah. Got him on Gate D3."
封锁只是最近才解除的，"赤木博士说，"碇之前就溜出去了。因此，我们现在只能依靠摄像头。MAGI 正在筛选录像，而且……"她停顿了一下，"啊哈，在 D3 门找到了他。
She tapped a few buttons, and the holographic projection in front of the bridge shifted. The view it now showed was clearly from a ceiling mounted security camera. It showed a certain young boy walking straight out of NERV without even a glance directed his way from the gate guards.
她轻触了几下按钮，驾驶舱前方的全息投影随之变换。新显示的画面显然来自一个安装在天花板上的监控摄像头。画面中，一个年轻男孩径直走出 NERV，连门口的警卫都没有向他投去一眼。
"Got ID on those two idiots?" Misato asked.
"那两个蠢货的身份查到了吗？" 葛城美里问道。
A button press later, and now the screen showed the profiles of the gate guards. Misato seethed, before shaking her head and looking at Asuka. "I think that's all we're going to get from the cameras. From the timestamp, he left the Geofront only a few minutes after the end of your fight. But... why?"
按下按钮后，屏幕上显示了闸门守卫的资料。葛城美里气愤不已，随后摇了摇头，看向明日香。“我觉得我们从摄像头能得到的信息就这些了。从时间戳来看，他在你们战斗结束几分钟后就离开了第三新东京市。但是……为什么呢？”
Asuka looked down at the ground and rubbed her forehead as she tried to work out what had made Shinji leave. There were no pressing engagements that she could think of, and school would likely have been cancelled for the rest of the day due to the clean-up. Looking up at the screen as the footage looped, Asuka noted the slightly hunched back and downturned gaze of her roommate and friend.
明日香低头看着地面，揉着额头，试图弄清楚真嗣离开的原因。她想不出有什么紧急的事务，而且由于清理工作，学校那天很可能已经停课了。抬头看着屏幕上循环播放的画面，明日香注意到她的室友兼朋友微微驼背和低垂的目光。
"He's unhappy," Asuka blurted out. At the curious looks from the two adults, she hastened to clarify. "Look at him. He looks like he's walking to get away from something, not going home."
"他看起来不高兴，" 明日香脱口而出。面对两位成年人好奇的目光，她急忙解释道：“看看他，他走路的样子像是在逃离什么，而不是回家。”
Misato and Akagi looked at each other.
美里和赤木相视一眼。
"He's running away," Akagi mused. "I had a feeling this might happen eventually."
他正在逃跑，" 赤木沉思道，"我早有预感，这种事迟早会发生。
"Why would he not go home?" Rei asked. Asuka thought she could almost detect a hint of worry in her normally monotone voice. "Where else could he go?"
他为什么不回家呢？" 绫问。明日香觉得她几乎能从绫一贯平淡的语调中察觉到一丝担忧。"他还能去哪里呢？
Misato sighed and rubbed her eyes. "I don't have an answer to either of those questions."
碇真嗣叹了口气，揉了揉眼睛。“这两个问题我都无法回答。”
Asuka folded her arms. "How long until you can actually bother to start looking for him?"
明日香双臂交叉，问道：“你还要多久才能真正开始找他？”
"His Section Two detail left the Geofront as soon as the lockdown was lifted," said Akagi. "That's only a few men though. The rest of Section Two have their own duties we can't pull them from just yet."
“他的第二分队一解除封锁就离开了地下都市，”赤木说道，“但那只是少数人。其余的第二分队还有我们不能立即抽调的职责。”
Slapping a hand to her forehead in exasperation, Asuka growled. "Fine. But I want to know immediately the moment you geniuses find him. And when you do, I want to be the one to bring him in." She turned to leave, catching Ayanami's eye for a split second as she did so. Was that sympathy in those strange red eyes?
恼怒地拍了拍额头，明日香低吼道：“好吧。但你们这些天才一找到他，我要立刻知道。而且，我要亲自把他带回来。”她转身离开，离开时与绫波的目光交汇了一瞬。那双奇异的红色眼眸中，是同情吗？
"Why do you want to get to him first?" asked Misato, tactfully ignoring the fact that a subordinate had just tried to order her around.
"你为什么想先找到他？" 问话间，葛城美里巧妙地忽略了下属刚刚试图对她发号施令的事实。
Asuka paused before leaving the bridge. She took a deep breath. "Because I should have realised sooner that there was something wrong with my friend."
明日香在离开桥前停顿了一下。她深吸了一口气。“因为我本应该更早意识到我的朋友出了问题。”
XXX
The longer shower at home did little to comfort Asuka. She wanted to be out there, helping to find Shinji. But Tokyo-3 was such a large place, and he might not even be in the city by this point.
在家中洗的更长时间的热水澡并没有给明日香带来多少安慰。她想要出去，帮助寻找真嗣。但东京-3 这么大，他现在甚至可能已经不在城市里了。
Asuka gently banged her head against the tiled bathroom wall as hot water cascaded down her back. She was a college genius with two degrees, yet she had been too dumb to notice that Shinji was feeling depressed. Having only known him face to face for a few weeks, his shyness had seemed normal, considering he had been practically yanked out of the quiet life he'd had before coming to Tokyo-3.
明日香轻轻地用头撞击着浴室瓷砖墙，热水顺着她的背倾泻而下。她是个拥有两个学位的大学生天才，却愚蠢到没有察觉到真嗣的抑郁情绪。仅仅面对面认识他几周，考虑到他之前被突然拽离了原本平静的生活来到第三新东京市，他的羞涩似乎很正常。
Talking through words on paper and a computer screen could only do so much for learning about somebody.
通过纸上的文字和电脑屏幕交流，对于了解一个人来说只能做到这一步。
Now it was clear there was something wrong. Did Shinji feel threatened by her? She had occasionally attempted to trade some friendly barbs with Shinji, rather like poking him with a stick to see if he'd bite back, only for the boy to instantly apologise for whatever minor thing she had pretended to take offence to. It was as if he didn't want to risk any sort of conflict at all. It was kind of... boring. He rarely ever spoke when the three pilots were together at school, seemingly content to just listen in most of the time.
现在很明显出了问题。真嗣是否感到被她威胁了？她偶尔会试图与真嗣交换一些友好的戏谑，就像用棍子戳他看他是否会反击一样，结果这个男孩总是立刻为任何她假装感到冒犯的小事道歉。他似乎根本不想冒任何冲突的风险。这有点……无聊。当三位驾驶员在学校聚在一起时，他很少说话，似乎大部分时间只是满足于倾听。
Asuka roughly turned off the taps and stepped out of the shower. She dried herself off, before dressing in what she liked to call her 'comfy clothes'. She didn't expect to hear anything from Misato or Section Two for a while, seeing as there was so much area to search, so she didn't plan to be going out again for a while.
明日香粗暴地关掉水龙头，从淋浴间走出来。她擦干身体，然后穿上她所谓的“舒适衣服”。考虑到搜索区域如此之大，她并不期待很快从美里或第二部门听到任何消息，因此她不打算再出去一段时间。
Except she hadn't had dinner yet. Asuka's stomach growled, and she groaned in frustration. Something she was already starting to miss was Shinji's cooking. While he wasn't a world-class chef, he certainly knew his way around a kitchen better than Misato and herself combined. Then again, considering Misato practically had negative cooking skill, that wasn't saying much.
只是她还没吃晚饭。明日香的肚子咕噜作响，她懊恼地呻吟着。她已经开始怀念起真嗣的厨艺了。虽然他算不上世界级大厨，但他在厨房里的本事绝对比美里和她加起来还要强。再说了，考虑到美里几乎可以说是负的烹饪技能，这也不算什么夸大其词。
Asuka still couldn't figure out how the mad woman had once managed to make dry soup.
明日香仍然搞不懂那个疯狂的女人是怎么做出干巴巴的汤的。
A couple minutes on the phone and twenty more of waiting resulted in a decent enough take-out dinner to satisfy Asuka's stomach. She took the leftovers next door and put it in Misato's fridge, but she had a feeling her guardian wouldn't be home for quite a while. It wasn't even twenty-hundred yet, but clean-up and the resulting paperwork would likely conspire to keep Misato at NERV until after midnight at the earliest, at which point she'd likely grab a beer or two and go straight to sleep. And then wake up and grab another beer. Or two.
电话里聊了几分钟，又等了二十分钟，总算拿到了一份还算过得去的外卖，足以填饱明日香的肚子。她把剩菜带到了隔壁，放进美里家的冰箱，但直觉告诉她，她的监护人一时半会儿还回不来。现在连晚上八点都不到，但清理工作和随之而来的文书工作很可能会让美里在 NERV 一直待到午夜之后，那时她多半会喝上一两瓶啤酒，然后直接睡觉。第二天醒来，再喝上一两瓶。
There was nothing worth watching on Misato's television, and she didn't feel like trying to stumble through her homework. The work itself would be almost insultingly easy, but Asuka had some trouble reading the kanji. Not that she'd ever want to admit it.
美里家的电视上没什么值得一看的节目，她也不想费劲去对付自己的作业。那些作业本身简单得近乎侮辱智商，但明日香在阅读汉字时有些困难。当然，她绝不会承认这一点。
With nothing better to do, she laid in her bed and played her handheld game device for a couple hours before finally deciding to turn in.
无所事事之下，她躺在床上玩了几个小时的手持游戏机，最终才决定睡觉。
XXX
Morning dawned, and Asuka grumpily rose with it. She ran a comb through her hair just enough to smooth out the bed head, then proceeded to the kitchen with the intent of grouching at Shinji until breakfast was placed in front of her. She was sitting at the kitchen table for two minutes before remembering that he wouldn't be there to cook anything. Her head fell to meet the table, eliciting a grunt of annoyance.
清晨来临，明日香不情愿地随之起床。她用梳子简单梳理了一下头发，以抚平睡乱的发型，然后带着对真嗣发牢骚的意图走进厨房，直到早餐摆在她面前。她在厨房桌旁坐了两分钟才想起真嗣不会在那里做饭。她的头重重地落在桌面上，发出一声恼怒的哼声。
She made do with cereal.
她只好用谷物麦片应付一下。
As Asuka was preparing to get ready for school, some good news finally arrived. Some automated system from Tokyo-3 Municipal High School sent her a text saying that there would be no school that day. She honestly didn't know whether to consider it a good or bad thing.
当明日香正准备去上学时，终于传来了一些好消息。东京第三市立高中的一套自动化系统给她发来短信，告知那天学校不上课。她实在不知道该把它看作好事还是坏事。
After un-preparing for school, Asuka went next door. Misato was predictably still asleep, so she left the television off. The overworked woman needed sleep more than Asuka needed to be entertained by whatever morning programs were running. Instead she resorted to reading magazines and playing games with the sound turned down.
在取消准备上学后，明日香去了隔壁。如预料的那样，美里还在睡觉，所以她没有打开电视。这位过度劳累的女性比明日香更需要睡眠，而不是通过播放早间节目来娱乐她。于是她转而阅读杂志，并调低音量玩游戏。
It was close to midday when Misato finally crawled out of bed, stumbling past Asuka like a zombie. Half a minute later, Asuka heard the traditional shout that signified that Misato Katsuragi was now awake. She gave it a few more minutes before heading into the kitchen, where her guardian was slowly munching on the take-out leftovers.
快到中午时，美里终于从床上爬起来，像僵尸一样蹒跚地经过明日香。半分钟后，明日香听到了标志着葛城美里醒来的传统喊声。她又等了几分钟才走进厨房，她的监护人正在慢慢咀嚼外卖剩菜。
"Before you ask, there's been nothing so far," said Misato. "We've managed to set more men onto the search, so it's only a matter of time now, especially with the MAGI keeping an eye on the cameras in the city."
在你提问之前，目前还没有任何发现，" 碇真嗣说。"我们已经增派了更多人手进行搜寻，所以现在只是时间问题，特别是在 MAGI 监控城市摄像头的情况下。
"That's if he's even still in Tokyo-3," Asuka replied as she sat down at the table next to Misato.
"前提是他还在第三新东京市，" 明日香回答道，她坐在碇真嗣旁边的桌子旁。
"He'd need to use his ID card if that were the case. And those things are monitored." Misato smirked. "NERV is paying you, but we're going to get suspicious of any large purchases or withdrawals. You probably won't be stopped, but we are going to make sure you're not doing anything illegal."
如果真是那样，他得用身份证。而且那些东西都是被监控的。" 碇真嗣笑了笑，"虽然 NERV 在给你发工资，但我们会对任何大额购买或提款产生怀疑。你可能不会被拦下，但我们会确保你没有做任何违法的事。
"Somehow I don't think Shinji is going to buy a car and skip town."
我总觉得，真嗣不会买车然后一走了之。
"No, but if he hops on a train, he'll need to use his card to validate." Misato threw the empty food container over her shoulder, where it bounced off the wall before settling neatly into the trash can. The empty Yebisu can followed, landing in the recycle bin next to it. Misato clearly had plenty of experience, as she'd done it without even glancing behind.
"不，但如果他乘火车，就需要用卡验证。" 渚薰随手将空食品盒向后一抛，它撞到墙上后准确落入垃圾桶。空了的惠比寿啤酒罐也紧随其后，稳稳落入旁边的回收箱。渚薰显然经验丰富，整个过程连头都没回。
"And then you'll move in?" Asuka inquired.
"然后你就搬进来吗？" 明日香问道。
Misato shook her head. "No. For starters we don't want to scare Shinji. Having the train suddenly stop and get filled with black suits wouldn't exactly paint a good picture. He might panic. Besides, you did imply yesterday that you wanted to talk to him. We'll just find Shinji, observe, and let you take it from there."
碇真嗣摇了摇头。“不，首先我们不想吓到真嗣。如果火车突然停下，然后挤满了黑衣人，那画面可不太好。他可能会惊慌失措。而且，你昨天确实暗示过你想和他谈谈。我们只需找到真嗣，观察一下，然后就交给你了。”
"Good."
好的。
XXX
The rest of the day passed slowly. Misato did have to return to the Geofront to do some more paperwork, but she returned a few hours later with some good news.
余下的日子过得很慢。碇真嗣确实得回地底都市处理一些文书工作，但几小时后她带着好消息回来了。
"We got a hit on Shinji's card," she said to Asuka as they tucked into another take-away dinner.
"真嗣的卡有动静了，"她和明日香一边吃着外卖晚餐一边说道。
The redhead almost spat out her mouthful of food. "What? Really? Where?!"
那位红发女子差点把嘴里的食物喷出来。"什么？真的吗？在哪里？"
"It was only the one hit, and it was on a train that goes out past Lake Ashi." Misato took a bite of something hideously spicy before continuing. "We got the footage from the train, which showed Shinji staying on for quite a while before getting off at Hakone Jinja Station with that smart-ass kid you picked up during the fight."
就那么一次，是在一列经过芦之湖的火车上。" 葛城美里咬了一口极其辛辣的东西后继续说道，"我们从火车上获取了录像，显示真嗣在那列火车上待了很久，最后和那个在战斗中你捡到的自以为是的家伙一起在箱根神社站下了车。
"Aida," supplied Asuka. "The one who thought he could do your job."
"Aida," 阿苏卡补充道，“那个自以为能胜任你工作的人。”
"Arrogant little... boy," Misato muttered. "I just wanted to see how well you would do. Anyway, there were no cameras along whatever route the two of them took, so we've lost Shinji for the moment. Before I left, Ritsuko mentioned that somebody was going to see if they could find out anything from Aida's home address. If he and Shinji aren't there, maybe there's a clue as to where they've gone."
傲慢的小...男孩，" 美里低声嘟囔。"我只是想看看你能做得多好。不管怎样，他们走的那条路上没有摄像头，所以我们暂时失去了真嗣的踪迹。在我离开前，律子提到有人会去 Aida 的住址看看能否找到什么线索。如果他和真嗣不在那里，或许能找到他们去向的线索。

Asuka exhaled and tapped a finger against her forehead in thought as she tried to recall anything relevant about the nerd. Unfortunately, all that really stood out was his obsession with anything related to NERV or the military. "Well I've got nothing," she finally admitted.
明日香叹了口气，用手指轻敲着额头，试图回忆起关于那个书呆子的任何有用信息。可惜，最显眼的就是他对 NERV 或军事相关的一切的狂热。“唉，我真是想不出什么来，”她最终无奈地承认。

"I didn't think so," replied Misato sympathetically. "You'd already be out there if you did."
我也是这么想的，" 美里同情地说，"要是你真这么想，你早就出去了。

Letting out a growl of frustration, Asuka slapped a hand onto the table. "I should have seen that something was wrong with him. What kind of friend am I to not bother paying attention to him?"
懊恼地咆哮一声，明日香猛拍桌子。“我早该察觉到他不对劲。我这种朋友算什么，连关心他都做不到？”

"Stop putting yourself down. You were paying attention to him." Misato ran a finger around the rim of her third can of Yebisu. "Shinji's just a very shy and quiet person. I saw that rather clearly during his first days here. He almost seemed like he was forcing himself to ask me about starting training."
别再自贬了。你那时是在关注他。" 碇真嗣用手指轻抚着第三罐惠比寿啤酒的边缘，继续说道："真嗣是个很内向的人，他刚来的时候我就看出来了。他几乎是鼓起勇气才向我询问训练的事。

"Shinji asked for it, huh?" Asuka quirked an eyebrow.
"是真嗣要求的啊？" 明日香挑眉问道。

"Yeah. Took him a few tries, but when he finally got the words out I asked why he wanted to start training so soon. You know what Shinji told me?" Misato leaned back and looked thoughtfully up at the ceiling. "He said, what was it... um... Oh yes. 'A friend gave me some good advice a while ago for dealing with unpleasant but necessary tasks. Just because you don't want to do something you have to, doesn't mean you should put it off until the last minute.'"
是的。他试了几次才说出口，我问他为何急着开始训练。你猜真嗣怎么回答我？" 美里靠在椅背上，若有所思地望向天花板。"他说，是什么来着...嗯...对了。'有位朋友曾给我关于应对不愉快却必要任务的建议。不想做某事，不代表就该拖到最后一刻。'

Asuka's eyes widened as she quietly finished her own quote. "'If you get it over with as soon as possible, you'll feel much better afterwards.' I was the one who told him that."
明日香睁大了眼睛，轻声结束了自己的话：“‘尽快处理掉，之后你会感觉轻松许多。’这话是我对他说的。”

"I kind of figured that. So!" Misato suddenly leaned forward in her chair. "I've yet to ask either of you how this pen-pal thing started. Care to share?"
我隐约猜到了。那么！" 碇真嗣突然向前倾身。"我还没问过你们俩，这种笔友关系是怎么开始的。愿意说说吗？

Asuka sighed. At least telling the story would help pass the time.
明日香叹了口气。讲讲这个故事，至少能消磨一下时间。

Eventually the two of them decided to head to bed. Asuka noted that Misato didn't take a Yebisu can to bed with her, which implied that her guardian would likely be starting work relatively early tomorrow.
最终，两人决定就寝。明日香留意到美里没有带啤酒上床，看来她的监护人明天一大早就要开始工作了。

In a way, that turned out to be incredibly correct.
某种意义上，这最终被证实极为正确。

Asuka grumbled sleepily as something shook her shoulder. "Gerroff," she mumbled as she tried to roll away from the invasion of her sleep time.
明日香睡意朦胧地嘟囔着，因为有什么东西在摇晃她的肩膀。“别烦我，”她含糊地说着，试图从打扰她睡眠的动作中挪开。

"Just wake up, Asuka, I've got good news," came the intruder's exasperated reply. With about as much enthusiasm as a bear getting interrupted in the middle of hibernation, Asuka finally sat up in bed. And just like a bear, she was growling and ready to shred somebody.
"醒醒吧，明日香，我有好消息，"闯入者带着几分不耐烦回应道。明日香终于从床上坐起，那模样就像冬眠中被惊扰的熊，毫无兴致。她咆哮着，仿佛随时准备撕碎某人。

"We've found Shinji," said Misato, who was crouched down next to Asuka's bed to look her in the eyes.
"我们找到真嗣了，" 美里蹲在明日香床边，目光直视着她，说道。

That woke her up. "Where?!" she demanded as she almost leapt out of bed. Her clothes from yesterday were still on the floor, and she picked them up. There wasn't time for complicated things like opening a closet door.
这突如其来的声响将她惊醒。"什么地方?!" 她急切地追问，几乎是从床上蹦起来的。昨天换下的衣物依旧散落在地板上，她匆忙拾起。此刻，连打开衣柜都显得太过繁琐。

"Lake Ashi, on the opposite shore from the city." Misato turned around to give Asuka some privacy. "The agent who went to Aida's residence learned from the boy's father that he likes to go camping. Fortunately for us, Aida's smart enough to tell his father exactly where he camps out, and a VTOL flyover found their site right where it was supposed to be."
位于城市对岸的芦之湖畔，美里转过身，为明日香留出私人空间。'前往相田家的特工从其父处获悉，他酷爱露营。所幸相田聪明，会向父亲透露露营的具体地点，一架垂直起降飞机的空中搜索也顺利找到了他们的营地，正是在预想的位置。'

"And what damn time do they call this?" Asuka grouched as she pulled her shirt over her head. She glanced out of her window through the partially open curtains. There was a faint light on what little she could see of the horizon, the phenomenon that tended to get called 'false dawn' which meant that there was still around an hour until sunrise.
"这算什么鬼时间啊？" 明日香嘟囔着，一边将衬衫拉过头顶。她透过半掩的窗帘向外望去，只见地平线尽头透出一抹微光，这便是常说的"假黎明"，预示着日出尚需约一小时。

"You did want to know as soon as possible," Misato reproachfully said. "But I reasoned that neither you nor Shinji would want to be woken up at two in the morning."
你确实希望尽快得知，" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷略带责备地说。"但我考虑到，你和真嗣应该都不愿意在凌晨两点被吵醒。

"Like this is much better," grumbled Asuka. "So are we heading there now?"
这样好多了，"飞鸟嘟囔道。"我们现在就过去吗？

"Very soon." Misato pushed a cup of coffee into her hands. "It's a bit of a long drive, but I want to get there just after dawn. You know Shinji's an early riser."
马上就好。" 碇真嗣递给她一杯咖啡。"虽然路途较长，但我打算黎明后不久就到。你知道真嗣习惯早起。

"Well at least I have something else to be mad at him for."
至少我还有其他事情可以对他发火。

"...This is a good thing?"
...这是好事吗？

XXX

"I think you can work out the rest."
我想剩下的你应该能自己解决。

"Yeah," said Shinji as he and Asuka walked through the woods. He didn't know where Asuka was going, so he was simply following along behind her. He frowned. "Wait, you said that Misato dragged you out here. And after that you said you demanded she bring you here."
是啊，" 真嗣边走边说，他和明日香正穿行于林间。他不清楚明日香的目的地，只是默默跟随其后。他眉头微蹙。"等等，你之前说是美里硬拉你来的。后来你又说是你坚持要她带你来的。

"N-never you mind that!" Asuka snapped, but Shinji could still hear relief in her voice. "Anyway, we should reach the car soon. Unfortunately, Misato did mention that you'd have to be taken back to the Geofront for your disappearing act first."
N-这事你别管了！"明日香急忙打断，尽管如此，真嗣还是听出了她语气中的释然。"不管怎样，我们快到车那儿了。只是美里之前确实说过，你得先回一趟 Geofront，处理你突然消失的事。

Shinji sighed. "I figured as much," he dolefully replied.
真嗣叹了口气。“果然不出我所料，”他带着几分沮丧回答道。

"They're going to want to know why too." Asuka glanced at him. "You gonna be okay telling them what you told me?"
他们肯定也想知道为什么。" 明日香瞥了他一眼。"你能像刚才对我说的那样，坦白告诉他们吗？

"I guess." 我想是这样。

Asuka came to a sudden stop and folded her arms. "None of this non-committal crap, Shinji. Yes or no?"
明日香猛地停下，双臂抱胸。"别跟我玩含糊其辞，真嗣。直接说是或不是。"

Shinji looked at her. There was anger and frustration in her body language, yet it was clear Asuka was concerned. He took a breath. "Yeah, I'll tell them."
真嗣注视着她，从她的肢体语言中可以感受到愤怒与挫败，但同样明显的是，明日香也心怀担忧。他深吸一口气，说道：“嗯，我会转告他们的。”

"Good. And if you want, I'll be there too."
当然可以。如果你需要，我也会到场。

"Only if you really want to," Shinji said with a slight smile.
"只有你真心想做的话，" 碇真嗣微微一笑说道。

"What did I just say about being non-committal?"
我刚才不是说了要保持中立吗？

The smile faded. "But... you just said the same sort of thing..."
笑容逐渐消失。“可是……你刚才不也说了类似的话吗……”

"Yes or no, Ikari!" 是还是不是，碇！

"Erm... thank you for the offer, but..." Shinji tried to square his shoulders, but no matter how willing his mind was to live up to the concept, his body just didn't seem able to make the attempt. "I think I need to deal with this myself."
嗯...感谢你的好意，不过..." 真嗣努力挺直腰板，奈何心有余而力不足，身体始终无法配合。"我觉得这事还是得我自己来解决。

Asuka's glare softened. "That seems like a good answer. You might actually get out of this unscathed." She turned and resumed walking. "I'm still going to dema- strongly request that they find something for you to do."
明日香的目光缓和了。"这回答听起来挺不错。你或许真能全身而退。"她转过身，继续向前走。"我仍然会强烈建议他们给你安排些任务。"

"Like what? I can't pilot."
比如说什么？我可不会开飞机。

"For all you know they might find a solution. Stop being so damned negative."
据你所知，他们可能找到解决办法。别这么悲观。

"I'm sorry..." 对不起...

"And stop apologising." 别再道歉了。

"Sor-...um..." 索尔...呃...

The conversation trailed off. A few minutes later, they crested a hill to a familiar and welcome sight. Misato's sports car was parked just in front of them, the owner reclining on the hood almost like she was a magazine model. She didn't stir as the teenagers approached, and Shinji soon realised why as a hideously loud snore ripped through the air.
谈话声逐渐消失。不久，他们登上山丘，眼前映入熟悉而令人愉悦的一幕。美里小姐的跑车停在眼前，她斜倚在引擎盖上，宛如杂志中的模特。少年们走近时，她毫无动静，直到一阵响亮的鼾声划破宁静，碇真嗣这才恍然大悟。

Asuka let out an exasperated sigh as she stomped up to Misato and none-too-gently shook her awake.
明日香带着不耐烦的叹息，大步流星地走到美里身边，用力将她摇醒。

"Wstfgl?" was Misato's eloquent greeting.
"Wstfgl?" 是碇真嗣的巧妙问候。

"Got him," replied Asuka.
"抓到他了，" 阿苏卡回应说。

Misato shook herself awake, before looking at Shinji. Two seconds later, he was lifted off the ground in a bear hug by an exuberant woman babbling about how she was glad he was alright, did he have any idea how worried she was, and so on.
美里突然惊醒，随即望向真嗣。不出两秒，他就被一位情绪激动的女士紧紧抱起，她一边紧紧抱着他，一边兴奋地诉说着自己看到他安然无恙有多欣慰，他可知道她有多担心他。

"I'm... back," he whispered into her ear.
"我...回来了，" 他轻声在她耳边说道。

"Welcome back, Shinji," Misato whispered right back. "Let's get out of here."
真嗣，欢迎回来，" 三笠也轻声回应。"我们走吧。

### Chapter 09 It's Because We Care About You


Despite the warm welcome he got near the lake, the fact remained that Shinji had done something wrong. As a result, Misato became Captain Katsuragi the moment they entered the Geofront, where he was dressed down over his conduct for a couple of hours. Only the fact that he was a backup pilot, something he hated hearing when it was brought up, kept him from being dragged in front of Commander Ikari to answer for his actions.
尽管真嗣在湖畔受到热烈欢迎，但他确实犯了错。一踏入 Geofront，Misato 便化身为葛城上尉，对他进行了长达数小时的严厉训诫。唯一让他免于被带到伊卡里指挥官面前解释自己行为的原因，是他那令他厌恶的后备飞行员身份。

As Shinji despondently left the room where Captain Katsuragi had tongue-lashed him, he caught the eye of Asuka, who was waiting against the wall nearby. She fell into step with him as he passed.
真嗣带着沮丧离开被葛城上尉严厉训斥的房间，不经意间与靠在墙边的明日香目光交汇。她随即跟上他的步伐，与他同行。

"Did you manage to tell her?" she inquired.
"你告诉她了吗？"她问道。

Shinji hesitated slightly, then gave a slight nod. "Yeah."
真嗣稍作迟疑，随即微微颔首。“对。”

"And?" 然后呢？

"Misato said she was going to speak to Doctor Akagi, see if there was any progress." Shinji sighed, his shoulders slumping. "I'm not expecting a miracle though, and I don't think Misato is either."
Misato 说她准备和赤木博士交流一下，看看是否有进展。" 真嗣叹息着，肩膀垂了下来。"我并不指望奇迹发生，Misato 应该也是这么想的。

"There has to be something for you to do." Asuka rubbed the back of her head. "I suppose I should ask... what do you want to do here?"
总得有事情让你做吧。" 明日香摸了摸后脑勺。"我想我得问问...你在这儿想做些什么？

Shinji stopped and stared at nothing for a moment. "I just... don't want to be useless."
真嗣停下脚步，愣愣地望着前方，片刻后说道：“我只是……不想成为一个无用之人。”

Asuka slapped her forehead. "I know you don't want to be useless. So does Misato. Answer the question properly. What do you want to do?"
明日香拍了拍自己的额头，说：“我知道你不想一无是处，美里也是这么认为的。好好回答问题，你到底想做什么？”

"What do I want to do..." Shinji slowly echoed. It was a hard question. Being an assistant to Misato would be easy enough while being helpful, but he didn't have the skill or experience to do much of anything that she would likely find useful, and it felt like if he were to be offered that role, it would only be out of pity.
"我到底想做什么呢..." 真嗣喃喃自语。这个问题颇具挑战。作为美里小姐的助手，虽然轻松又能帮上忙，但他自知缺乏必要的技能和经验，难以胜任她可能需要的实质性工作。若真被赋予这一角色，恐怕也只是出于怜悯。

And Shinji didn't want pity.
真嗣并不希望得到怜悯。

"I want..." he began after sorting through his twisted thoughts, "to help you."
我想..." 他梳理完纷乱的思绪后开口道，"我来帮你。

"Me?"

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji thought he saw some redness on Asuka's face. "Yeah. I want to pilot. I don't want to sit around watching you fight on your own out there."
真嗣从眼角余光中察觉到明日香脸上似乎有些泛红。“对，我想驾驶。我不想干坐着，看你一个人孤军奋战。”

"Rei will be cleared for duty in a few days."
Rei 几天后就能获准执行任务。

"And then I'll have to sit around watching both of you."
接下来我就只能坐着看你们俩了。

"We're pilots, Shinji. Not helpless damsels in distress," Asuka growled in his face. "We don't need some knight in horrible purple armour coming to rescue us."
我们是飞行员，真嗣，不是那种需要救援的弱女子，" 明日香怒视着他，"我们不需要一个穿着难看紫色盔甲的骑士来搭救。

"Erm... t-that's not what I m-meant at all!" Shinji stammered, backing up a little. "I just want to be out there with you, by your side. Being an Eva pilot is supposed to be a one-in-a-million chance or something. If I don't go out there, I'm just wasting it."
呃...这完全不是我的本意！" 真嗣结巴着说，稍稍后退了一步。"我只是想和你并肩作战。成为 Eva 驾驶员本就是千载难逢的机会。如果我不参与，岂不是白白浪费了？

Asuka closed her eyes and exhaled, pressing a hand to her forehead. "Well it's a moot point anyway, since there's only two Evas until mine gets here. Even then though, you're not going to be cleared to fight with us unless you can project an AT-Field. Which, as has already been established, you can't do because of your silly little stunt with the contract."
明日香闭上双眼，深呼吸后，用手轻触额头。“其实这问题也没什么好讨论的，毕竟目前只有两台 Eva，我的那台还没到。即便到了，除非你能展开 AT 力场，否则你也无法获准与我们并肩作战。之前已经明确，你因为那次契约的鲁莽行为而无法做到。”

"I didn't know this was going to happen!" exclaimed Shinji. "I'm still having trouble believing it!"
我真没想到会发生这种事！" 真嗣惊叹道，"到现在我还是觉得难以置信！

"Oh trust me, so am I."
哦，相信我，我也是这么想的。

Asuka blinked and looked at something past Shinji's shoulder. He turned and saw Doctor Akagi standing behind him, her ever-present tablet in one hand.
明日香眨了眨眼，目光越过真嗣的肩膀，望向某处。他转过身，只见赤木博士正站在他身后，手里依旧拿着那台常不离手的平板电脑。

"I'm a scientist," she stated. "As such, I find this concept of soul transfer through signing a piece of paper to be utterly ridiculous. I've been working to try and find the real reason, but so far I haven't had any luck."
我是一名科学家，"她断言，"所以，我对于通过签一张纸就能转移灵魂的说法感到非常荒谬。我一直在试图找出真正的原因，可惜至今一无所获。

"Well you know what they say about eliminating the impossible, right?" Asuka remarked.
"你肯定听过那句关于排除万难的话吧？" 明日香评论道。

"Um... what?" Shinji confusedly glanced between the two of them.
"呃...什么情况？" 真嗣一脸茫然地来回打量着两人。

Doctor Akagi nodded. "Something I'm currently in the middle of," she replied, ignoring Shinji. "But that list is dwindling fast."
阿卡吉医生点头道：“这正是我眼下正在忙的，”她回应着，没理会真嗣。“不过，那清单上的项目已经所剩无几了。”

"So what did you come to see us for? Or were we just in your way?" asked Asuka.
"那么，你来找我们究竟有何贵干？还是我们无意中碍了你的事？" Asuka 问道。

Doctor Akagi looked at Shinji. "I'm here partially to say that we're doing all we can to try and resolve this problem." Her gaze returned to Asuka. "And partially to ask you something about your AT-Field."
安吉丽医生注视着真嗣，说道：“我来这儿一方面是想告诉你，我们正竭尽全力试图解决这一难题。”随后，她的视线转向了明日香，“另一方面，我想就你的 AT 力场问些问题。”

"What?" Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Something wrong with it?"
什么？" 明日香眉头一挑。"这有什么问题吗？

"It's 'wrong' in that it's not acting as we expect it to." Akagi consulted her tablet. "When we asked you to project your AT-Field during your activation test in Unit-01, we caught an anomaly. At the moment though, there's not enough data to nail down what it is, even with what I requested from NERV-Berlin."
问题在于它并未如我们所预期那样运作。" 赤木查看了她的平板。"在你进行初号机激活测试时，我们要求你展开 AT 力场，结果捕捉到了一个异常现象。尽管我已经向 NERV 柏林索取了更多数据，但目前仍缺乏足够信息来明确这一异常的本质。

She stared a hole into Asuka. "Precisely when did this... contract between you two get signed?"
她凝视着明日香，目光锐利。“你们俩之间的这份合同，到底是什么时候签订的？”

Asuka and Shinji glanced at each other. "Er, two years ago?" Asuka offered.
明日香与真嗣目光交汇，她试探地问道：“呃，是两年前吗？”

"Two years ago when? I need a date."
两年前具体是哪一天？我需要确切的日期。

Another glance passed between the teenagers. "September," Shinji began.
少年们再次交换了眼神。“九月，”真嗣开口道。

"Somewhere around the... twelfth I think," Asuka finished.
"大概是在第十二个左右，" 明日香说道。

Akagi sighed. "That's close enough I suppose. It matches up with what I have here." She waved the tablet. "NERV-Berlin's MAGI system picked up on a discrepancy in your AT-Field after that date. But since the people over there don't seem to care, they wrote it off as a glitch." The look on her face told Shinji exactly what the scientist thought of such sloppy thinking.
阿加吉叹了口气。“看来差不多就是这样了。和我手头的资料相符。”她挥动着手中的平板。“NERV 柏林的 MAGI 系统在那之后检测到你 AT 力场出现异常。但那边的人似乎并不当回事，直接当作系统故障处理了。”她脸上的表情已经让真嗣明白，这位科学家对这种草率的态度有多么不满。

"What kind of discrepancy?" he asked.
"您指的是哪方面的差异？"他询问道。

"Unknown. I've had our MAGI analysing it for the last couple of days, but like I said, there's not enough data."
情况不明。这几天我们一直在用 MAGI 进行分析，但正如我之前提到的，数据太少。

Asuka jabbed a thumb over her shoulder. "Should I hop in Unit-01 so you can get that data?"
明日香向后一指，问道：“我进初号机帮你取数据如何？”

"We don't need more data while your AT-Field is... at rest, shall we say," replied Akagi. "Ideally we'd take scans while you're in combat. Unfortunately you didn't use it during your fight with the Fourth Angel."
当你的 AT 力场处于静止状态时，我们无需更多数据，"赤木回应道。"理想状况下，我们希望在你战斗时进行扫描。遗憾的是，你在对抗第四使徒时并未启用它。

"I either didn't need to or was on battery power," Asuka retorted hotly. "And I don't want to run out of power just because I'm playing defensively."
我当时要么不需要，要么是电池供电，" 明日香激动地反驳。"我不想仅仅因为采取防守就耗尽电力。

Akagi raised a hand in a placating gesture. "That's understandable. I'm not blaming you for that. But when the next Angel comes, at least consider blocking something for a few seconds while you're plugged in. We can scan your AT-Field while it's under load and get the information I need."
赤木举手示意安抚，说道：“这我能理解，并非责怪你。只是下次使徒来袭时，你接入后至少尝试阻挡几秒。我们趁你的 AT 力场受压时进行扫描，就能得到我需要的数据。”

Shinji watched as Asuka sank into thought. "Fine," she said after a few seconds. "I'll play it safe at the start of the fight or something."
真嗣注视着明日香陷入沉思。"行吧，"她几秒后开口，"战斗初期我会稳扎稳打，采取保守策略。"

"That'll do," said Akagi, before she began to walk off.
"这样就行了," 阿贺木说完, 便开始离开。

"Wait!" Asuka called out. The scientist stopped and glanced curiously behind at the redhead. "Can you let Shinji get in on the sync tests and training now, despite the fact that you don't want to deploy him?"
等等！" 明日香叫住了科学家。他停下脚步，好奇地回头望向那位红发少女。"虽然你并不打算让他上战场，但现在能否让真嗣参与同步测试和训练呢？

Akagi's eyes drifted up to the ceiling, and her head bobbed slightly as she apparently gave the idea some thought. "I suppose we can do that," she finally said. "No point having a backup pilot that hasn't been keeping up with their training, after all. And more data might aid in finding us a solution. I'll schedule some training and sync tests for tomorrow, since you're so insistent."
阿贺木的目光飘向天花板，头微微点着，似乎在认真考虑这个提议。“我想我们可以这么做，”她最终说道，“毕竟，没有理由让备份飞行员荒废训练。而且，更多的数据或许能帮助我们找到解决方案。既然你这么坚持，我会安排明天的训练和同步测试。”

Asuka nodded, and Akagi managed to leave without any further interruptions. Once the scientist was out of sight, Shinji noticed his friend staring intently at him out of the corner of his eye. And smiling.
明日香点头示意，赤木这才得以无阻地离开。待科学家身影消失后，真嗣察觉到他的朋友正从眼角处专注地凝视着他，脸上还挂着微笑。

"There you go, now you can join me in training," she cheerily said when he turned to face her. Then the smile on her face turned evil. "We'll see just how good you are, Third Child."
去吧，现在你可以加入我的训练了，"她愉快地说，当他转过身来面对她时。随即，她脸上的笑容变得狡黠。"让我们瞧瞧你究竟有多强，第三适格者。

Shinji suddenly wished he'd kept his mouth shut.
真嗣突然希望自己能保持沉默。

XXX

The Second Child was merciless; practically a slave driver.
第二个孩子冷酷无情，简直就像个监工。

Asuka had insisted on going one-on-one against him in the simulators, claiming that she wanted to give him an accelerated version of the training she herself had received. At the beginning, Shinji couldn't even run away from her; she was just always there.
明日香执意要在模拟器中与真嗣一对一较量，她表示这是为了让他体验一种加速版的训练，类似于她自己所经历的。开始时，真嗣根本无法摆脱她的追击；她仿佛无处不在。

There was no help from Misato and Doctor Akagi either. Since it was the simulator, and Asuka was the more experienced and skilled pilot, they had let her have almost completely free reign over how to get Shinji up to speed, and she took full advantage of it.
葛城小姐和赤木博士均未施以援手。由于是在模拟器训练，加之明日香经验丰富、技术高超，他们几乎完全让她自由发挥，指导真嗣提升技能，而她也不遗余力地充分利用了这个机会。

The only thing Asuka could complain about was that the simulators didn't have the data for Unit-02, so she was essentially piloting a copy of Unit-01 against Shinji. The sole concession was that it was easy to change her simulator Evangelion's colours to those of Unit-02.
明日香唯一不满的是，模拟器中没有二号机的数据，她只能驾驶一号机的复制品与真嗣对练。唯一能做的调整，就是将模拟器中使徒的颜色换成二号机的颜色。

Eventually though, after a week of hellish training sessions that went from immediately after school until dinner time, Shinji finally managed to land a punch on Asuka. She then grinned and socked Unit-01 in the face while Shinji was distracted by the small victory.
经过一周从放学持续到晚饭时间的地狱式训练，真嗣终于在某个时刻击中了明日香。她随即露出得意的笑容，趁真嗣沉浸在小小的胜利中时，给了初号机一个响亮的耳光。

Now that Shinji could move and fight to Asuka's satisfaction, training shifted from one-on-one to fighting the Angels. First was the original 'Angel' data that had been used for Shinji's basic training; essentially an Evangelion with the ability to freely fire energy bolts. Asuka and Misato taught Shinji how to work together with another Evangelion to take down the target in various ways. Including from long range with a giant sniper rifle.
由于真嗣的移动和战斗能力已达到明日香的要求，训练内容从单挑转为对抗使徒。首先采用的是真嗣基础训练时使用的原始“使徒”数据，即一台能自由发射能量弹的福音战士。明日香和美里指导真嗣学习如何与另一台福音战士协作，运用多种战术击败目标，包括使用巨型狙击步枪进行远程打击。

Shinji wondered if a real Angel would ever give an Evangelion time to set a sniper rifle up.
真嗣思索着，真正的使徒是否会给初号机留出架设狙击步枪的时间。

Then he was pitted against the Fourth Angel solo. He ended up getting thrown into the simulated hill that Asuka had landed on in the real fight, then charged the Angel while low on power as he tried to destroy the core with only a Progressive Knife. It was almost sheer luck that the core failed before Unit-01's battery did. Asuka was dissatisfied with the result, calling him reckless for attempting such a crazy stunt, and made him do it again.
之后，他孤身对抗第四使徒。不慎被抛至模拟山丘，恰是明日香实战中着陆之处。电量告急之际，他奋不顾身冲向使徒，仅凭一把高振动粒子刀欲摧毁核心。幸赖天意，核心在初号机电池耗尽前先行崩溃。明日香对此结果不满，斥其鲁莽，责令重试。

And now the fight was over, as was the training. For now at least. It had still taken a Progressive Knife and several long, tense seconds of grinding away at the core, but at least he hadn't been half a second away from failure like before. Shinji almost collapsed onto the gantry as he got out of the entry plug. After nearly two weeks of this, he was surprised he could still move under his own power.
战斗与训练如今暂告一段落。尽管仍需借助渐进式刀具，耗费数分钟紧张地磨削核心，但至少这次他不像之前那样仅差半秒就面临失败。真嗣从插入栓中出来后，几乎瘫倒在通道上。经过近两周的磨砺，他惊讶自己还能自主行动。

One of the engineering crew for Unit-01 stepped up and helped him down the gantry steps and away from the Evangelion. Several others gave Shinji impressed looks and nods of encouragement as he passed. The door to the Evangelion Cage opened and Asuka strode through, stopping quickly as she almost bumped into him. The crewman escorting him practically handed him over to her with a pat on the back before heading off.
零号机工程队的一员主动上前，协助他从舷梯下来，远离了福音战士。其他队员在他经过时，纷纷投来赞赏的目光，并点头鼓励。此时，通往福音战士笼子的门开启，明日香快步进入，差点与他相撞，急忙停下脚步。护送他的队员在他背上轻拍一下，仿佛将他托付给明日香后便离开了。

"I suppose we didn't have to go for another hour today," Asuka remarked as they headed for the changing rooms. "But now, if and when you fight with us, I hope you'll be smart enough to not be so damn reckless."
我想我们今天不必再额外训练一个小时了，" 明日香边走向更衣室边说道。"不过，将来若你与我们并肩作战，希望你能明智些，别再如此鲁莽。

Shinji blearily blinked at her before nodding. "Yes, Asuka."
真嗣睡眼惺忪地看了她一眼，随即点头道："嗯，明日香。"

"Good. Otherwise..." She lightly slapped him across the back of the head. "I'll be doing that to you in an Eva."
好的。不然的话……"她轻拍了一下他的后脑勺。"我可就要在 Eva 里这样对你了。

Despite everything, Shinji found himself grateful. Asuka had taken the time to train him up to an acceptable standard, and Doctor Akagi had stated that she was exploring a potential solution to his situation when she had the time. She hadn't given him any specifics, claiming that she didn't want to get Shinji's hopes up, but he was hopeful all the same.
尽管面临种种困难，真嗣内心依然充满感激。明日香不辞辛劳地指导他，使他的能力达到了一个令人满意的水平。赤木博士也承诺，一旦有空，她会寻找解决他困境的方法。虽然她没有透露具体方案，以免让真嗣期望过高，但真嗣心中仍怀揣着希望。

The two teenagers split up at the change rooms, and Shinji headed right for the showers. Even the semi-permanent summer in Japan couldn't stop him from enjoying a hot shower to ease the aches of a long training session; getting the LCL off was almost just a bonus. Even so, he was finished and out of the change room first. It took ten more minutes before Asuka joined him, still fussing with her hair as she placed the bright red A-10 clips back on her head.
两位少年在更衣室分别后，真嗣直奔淋浴间。尽管日本夏日漫长，他仍享受着热水澡带来的舒缓，以减轻长时间训练后的肌肉疲劳；洗去 LCL 几乎成了额外的奖赏。尽管如此，他还是第一个洗完并走出更衣室的。又过了十分钟，明日香才出现，她还在忙着整理头发，将那鲜红色的 A-10 发夹重新戴回头上。

Shinji had asked why she kept them on at all times, to which Asuka had said that she wanted people to know she was a pilot. She at least took them off at the end of the day when they got home, something which Shinji occasionally found himself anticipating.
真嗣曾好奇地问明日香为何总是戴着它们，明日香回答说，她想让大家知道自己是飞行员。至少每天回到家，她会摘下它们，真嗣有时竟会对此心生期待。

Asuka was rather pretty when-
明日香当时确实挺漂亮的

Shinji shook his head to banish the thought as he trailed after the object of his musings. It was time to go home, have some dinner, then go to bed. Futile fantasies could wait for another time, when he wasn't nearly so exhausted.
真嗣摇摇头，试图驱散这些思绪，他紧跟着自己所思的对象。该回家了，吃晚饭，然后休息。那些无谓的幻想，等他没那么累的时候再去想吧。

"Hey Shinji, what are you doing for din-"
嘿，真嗣，晚餐你准备吃什么？

Before Asuka could finish her sentence, there was a knock at their door. Shinji looked up curiously from where he had been scouting out what was in the fridge. Who could be calling on them at this hour, after a long day at NERV?
明日香话音未落，门外便响起了敲门声。真嗣从冰箱前抬起头，好奇地望向门口。在 NERV 度过漫长一天后，这个时间点，究竟是谁来访呢？

Asuka headed to the door and opened it. Shinji heard her say, "Oh, hello Misato."
明日香走到门前，打开了门，真嗣听到她打招呼说：“哦，美里，你好。”

"Hi Asuka," came their guardian's reply. "I invited Ritsuko to join me for dinner tonight, try and get her to relax a little, and I'm extending the invite to you two."
嗨，明日香，" 监护人回应说，"我请了律子今晚共进晚餐，希望她能放松些，你们俩也一起来吧。

"Oh. Um... we were just about to have dinner ourselves..."
哦，嗯...我们正要开饭呢...

"It's fine! I've already got stuff prepared! Go get Shinji and come on over. He needs a break anyway."
没问题！我这边已经准备妥当了！去把真嗣叫来，一起过来吧。他确实需要放松一下。

Asuka came into the kitchen a moment later, looking rather nervous and staring at nothing.
片刻之后，明日香走进厨房，显得颇为紧张，眼神空洞地凝视着前方。

"Are you alright, Asuka?" Shinji worriedly asked, taking a step towards her. She seemed to be in shock.
"你没事吧，明日香？" 真嗣关切地问，朝她走近一步。她看起来像是受到了惊吓。

Her head slowly turned towards him. "Hey Shinji..." she began, sounding rather distant. "Have you ever eaten something Misato made for you?"
她缓缓转头望向他，轻声开口：“嘿，真嗣……”语气中带着几分疏离，“你尝过美里做的菜吗？”

"Er..." Shinji's mind went back over the few weeks he had been in Tokyo-3. The first actual night had been spent in the hospital. On his first night in Misato's apartment she had ordered take-out. The second night he had cooked something. The third night had been when Asuka had arrived and they had moved into the apartment they now occupied.
"呃..." 真嗣的思绪飘回到他在东京-3 的这几周。第一个夜晚是在医院度过的。入住米萨托家的首晚，她叫了外卖。第二个晚上，他亲自下厨。到了第三个晚上，明日香来了，他们便搬进了现在的公寓。

"No," he admitted. "I guess I wasn't living with her long enough."
不，" 他承认说，"看来我和她同住的时间还不够久。

"Oh dear," Asuka quietly said. "You're going to be in for quite a treat tonight then."
哎呀，" 明日香低声说，"看来你今晚有口福了。

"What? Why?" 什么？怎么了？

"Trust me, it's something you have to experience first-hand. Words simply cannot do enough."
相信我，这事儿你得亲自体验。光用言语实在难以尽述。

Asuka refused to speak any more on the subject, so Shinji gave up and followed her next door. The first thing that greeted him was an acrid smell. The second thing was Misato's expectant face.
明日香不愿再谈及此事，真嗣只好作罢，跟着她去了隔壁。首先扑鼻而来的是一股刺鼻的气味，紧接着映入眼帘的是美里满怀期待的面容。

"Took you two long enough!" the woman exclaimed, practically dragging the teenagers into her kitchen. Doctor Akagi was already there, and she gave them a lazy wave as they sat down at the table; Asuka much more hesitantly than Shinji.
"你们俩真是慢吞吞的！"女人嚷道，几乎是拖着两个少年进了厨房。赤木医生已在那里，当他们坐下时，她懒散地挥了挥手；明日香比真嗣显得更为迟疑。

"Hello Doctor," said Shinji.
新二说：'你好，医生，'

"I'm off the clock, Shinji," Doctor Akagi replied. "It's Ritsuko for tonight."
我下班了，真嗣，" 赤木博士微笑着说，"今晚叫我律子就好。

Shinji nodded, and turned his gaze to the source of the smell that was starting to sting his eyes. A pot of curry was sitting on the stove, roiling and bubbling away. Nearby sat several large cups of instant ramen. He glanced at Asuka, who gave him a look that could only be described as 'warning'.
碇真嗣点头示意，随即望向那股开始刺激他眼睛的气味来源。炉子上，一锅咖喱正咕嘟咕嘟地沸腾着。旁边则摆着几大碗即食拉面。他看向明日香，她投来的目光明显带着警告的意味。

Misato bustled around the kitchen, preparing the ramen and stirring the curry. She made a brief detour to the fridge, where she grabbed a few cans of Yebisu and put them on the table. One for her, one for Ritsuko, and two placed in front of both Shinji and Asuka; the redhead staring at it as if it were a birthday present. Unfortunately, Misato remembered herself a moment later and took the last two back, to Asuka's visible disappointment. Cups of ramen were soon passed out, and the curry was transferred to the middle of the table.
三佐在厨房里忙个不停，一边准备拉面，一边搅拌着咖喱。她顺路走到冰箱前，拿出几罐惠比寿啤酒放在桌上。一罐留给自己，一罐给律子，还有两罐分别摆在真嗣和明日香面前；红发的明日香盯着啤酒，好像那是份生日礼物。可惜，三佐很快意识到不妥，又把最后两罐收了回去，让明日香明显感到失落。不久，拉面碗被分发完毕，咖喱也被移到了桌子中央。

To Shinji's faint relief, the ramen smelled alright. He had been expecting something far worse, given Asuka's reaction not long ago. He separated the chopsticks and began to eat.
让真嗣略感安心的是，拉面的香气还算正常。考虑到不久前明日香的反应，他原本预想的情况要糟糕得多。他分开筷子，开始享用拉面。

"Hey Shinji, try some of this! It's great!"
嘿，真嗣，试试这个！真的很不错！

Without any warning, a spoonful of curry suddenly landed in his ramen. Shinji looked up at Misato, sitting across from him, who gave him an encouraging smile as she dumped several spoonfuls in her own cup. She paused to take a long drink of beer, and Shinji glanced at Asuka, who was silently mouthing the words 'don't do it' over and over while shaking her head. He looked back down at the surprise addition to his meal.
毫无预警地，一勺咖喱突然掉进了他的拉面里。真嗣抬头望向坐在对面的美里，她正对他露出鼓励的微笑，同时往自己的碗里加了好几勺。她停下动作，喝了一大口啤酒，真嗣又看向明日香，她正无声地重复着“别这样”，边说边摇头。他再次低头，看着这突如其来的食物变化。

Up close, the curry seemed to be almost purple in colour, and he couldn't identify anything in it. Shinji's eyes darted up. Misato showed every sign of enjoying her meal as she took massive mouthfuls of the ramen and curry. Surely it couldn't be as bad as Asuka was trying to make it out to be. He took a long, deep breath, readied his chopsticks, and some ramen and curry went into his mouth.
近看，咖喱呈现出近乎紫色的色泽，他分辨不出其中的食材。真嗣的视线迅速上移。美里正大口大口地享用着拉面和咖喱，显然吃得十分满足。应该不会像明日香形容的那么不堪。他深吸一口气，准备好筷子，夹起一些拉面和咖喱送入口中。

Shinji froze. The curry was... almost indescribable. It felt both gritty and slimy, and there were squishy bits in it.
真嗣愣住了。这咖喱的味道……简直难以言喻。口感既粗糙又滑腻，还夹杂着一些软绵绵的颗粒。

"Hang on, Shinji, I'll get you something to help with that," Asuka said in the despairing tone of somebody who'd just seen a person do something terminally stupid despite being warned.
"等等，真嗣，我给你找点能帮上忙的东西，"明日香绝望地说，仿佛目睹了一个人在警告后仍做出无可救药的蠢事。

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji saw her head to the fridge. Seconds later, she placed a glass of milk in front of him.
真嗣用眼角余光瞥见她走向冰箱，不一会儿，她便在他面前放了一杯牛奶。

"Drink this." 把这个喝了。

Shinji's hands were shaking slightly as he reached for the glass. He managed to force his lips open just enough to take a sip. As the milk flowed into his mouth, the horrendous texture of the curry began to disappear. Soon, he was able to close his eyes, grit his teeth, and swallow before coughing violently. He had a feeling it wasn't going to sit well, even if he drank an entire carton of milk.
真嗣伸手去拿玻璃杯时，手微微颤抖。他勉强张开嘴唇，抿了一小口牛奶。随着牛奶流入口中，咖喱那令人不快的口感逐渐消失。他闭上眼睛，咬紧牙关，艰难地吞咽下去，随即剧烈咳嗽。他预感即使喝完整盒牛奶，这不适感也难以消解。

"Judging from Shinji's reaction to your concoction, I think I'll pass," Ritsuko remarked as she dug into her own ramen.
"看真嗣对你那碗的反应，我还是不尝试了，" 律子说着，开始享用自己的拉面。

"Hey! He swallowed it, didn't he?" Misato pointedly stated, waving a hand at the distressed boy.
"嘿！他确实吞下去了，对吧？" 碇真嗣指着那焦虑不安的男孩，语气肯定地说。

"Maybe he just doesn't want to offend you."
或许他只是不想让你不高兴。

Whatever else the two adults said began to fade away as... things began to happen in Shinji's stomach. He clutched it with both hands, trying to suppress the flip-flops it was doing, but to no avail. Moments later, he was up and running for the bathroom where he proceeded to make a very important call on the big white telephone.
随着两位成年人话语的逐渐模糊，真嗣感到胃里一阵翻腾。他双手紧捂腹部，试图平息那股翻涌，却徒劳无功。片刻后，他急忙奔向洗手间，对着那部白色的大电话进行了一次紧急的“通话”。

There would be no solitude for him to contemplate his actions, however, as a hand suddenly began to rub his back. Only the fact that his insides were trying valiantly to become outsides prevented him from jumping in surprise.
他本无暇独处反思，不料一只手突然开始摩挲他的背。若非体内翻江倒海，他定会惊跳起来。

"Second time I've found you like this, Shinji," came Asuka's voice after an eternity. "Don't try and tell me you feel guilty about something this time though."
真嗣，这是第二次看到你这副模样了，" 阿苏卡的声音过了许久才传来。"别跟我说这次你又感到内疚了。

Shinji weakly shook his head. "Nuhhh," was all he managed to get out before he had to return his attention to his stomach.
真嗣虚弱地摇了摇头，只吐出一个“不”字，便不得不再次关注起自己的胃部。

"I did warn you," she said in a very I-told-you-so tone, while continuing to massage his back. "Yet you wouldn't listen. I'd say you got what you deserve, but nobody deserves Misato's curry."
我确实提醒过你，"她带着一种我早就说过的口吻，边说边继续给他按摩背部。"可你就是不听。你这是自食其果，但谁也不该承受美里做的咖喱。

After an eternity, Shinji collapsed against the wall of the toilet. "I thought..." he began, before rubbing the back of his hand across his mouth. "I thought it'd be okay, since I couldn't taste anything."
经过仿佛永恒的等待，真嗣无力地倚靠在洗手间的墙壁上。“我原以为……”他刚开口，便用手背抹了抹嘴唇。“我以为不要紧，毕竟我什么味道也尝不出来。”

Asuka frowned. "Don't lie, dumbass. I saw the look on your face out there."
明日香皱起眉头说：“别骗人了，傻瓜。我看到你刚才那副表情了。”

"It did feel like I had a mouthful of gravel and sludge," Shinji conceded, "but there wasn't any flavour."
真嗣承认，那感觉确实像嘴里满是碎石和淤泥，然而却毫无味道可言。

"You're not making any damn sense!"
你这话一点儿也不合逻辑！

"Well... I suppose it would help if I told you I haven't been able to taste anything for a while now."
嗯... 我想告诉你，我最近一直尝不出任何味道，这或许会有所帮助。

The admission wiped the angry look off Asuka's face. "What?! But... you've been cooking meals!"
这一承认让明日香脸上的怒气烟消云散。"什么？！可你明明一直在做饭啊！"

"I haven't tried anything new though," replied Shinji. "I've just been going off what I've done in the past. These days, everything tastes like bland to me."
我虽然没尝试新事物，" 真嗣回答说，"只是沿用过去的做法。如今，我总觉得什么味道都索然无味。

"Like... bland?" Asuka echoed in confusion.
"是说...很平淡吗？" 明日香不解地反问道。

"Yeah. Imagine the most utterly bland thing possible. You put it in your mouth but barely even know it's there. That's what food tastes like to me."
对，想象一下最索然无味的东西，你吃进嘴里几乎察觉不到它的存在。这就是我尝到的食物的味道。

Asuka let out a German word Shinji certainly didn't learn from his teacher, before running a hand through her hair. "Damn. Is that why you're not eating much?"
明日香突然冒出一句真嗣绝对没在课堂上听过的德语，接着用手梳理了一下头发。“真是的。难道这就是你吃得少的原因？”

Shinji nodded sadly. "What's the point of eating a lot if I can't enjoy it? I just don't have much of an appetite anymore."
真嗣神情哀伤地点了点头。“如果吃东西都不能让我感到快乐，那吃再多又有什么用呢？我现在真的没什么胃口了。”

"A side effect of the contract?" Asuka wondered.
"这是合同的副作用吗？"飞鸟感到疑惑。

Shinji pulled his head back slightly, giving her a puzzled look. "Why would not having a soul affect my taste buds?" he countered. "I know it's dumb to say, considering what we've been through, but that just doesn't make sense."
真嗣略微后仰头，一脸不解地望着她。“没有灵魂怎么会关系到我的味觉呢？”他反驳道，“我知道这话听起来挺傻的，毕竟我们经历过那么多，可这逻辑上说不通啊。”

"Yeah, I suppose." Asuka shook her head before holding out a hand to him. "Well come on then, let's get back out there before our captain sends a search party."
嗯，应该是吧。" 明日香摇摇头，伸手示意他。"走吧，我们得赶紧回去，免得船长派人出来找。

Shinji reached out and grabbed the proffered hand, letting out a grunt of effort as he stood back up. Just as he was about to leave the bathroom, he was stopped by a firm hand on his chest.
真嗣伸手握住递来的手，起身时发出一声努力的声音。就在他即将离开浴室之际，一只坚定的手按在他胸前，阻止了他。

"Hey," said the redheaded owner of the hand. "I don't care if food starts tasting like the ass-end of an Angel. Start. Eating. More." She frowned as she jabbed a finger into his ribs. "You're way too skinny."
嘿，"那位红发女士说，"就算食物变得像天使的屁股一样难吃，你也得开始多吃点。"她皱着眉，用手指戳了戳他的肋骨，"你实在太瘦了。

"I'll... try." 我试试看。

"There is no try," Asuka replied in a voice like a mad old wise man before grinning and leaving the bathroom.
"没有尝试这一说，" 明日香模仿着疯狂老智者的声音回答，然后咧嘴一笑，走出了浴室。

Back in the dining room, Shinji barely had time to sit down before he was the centre of attention.
回到餐厅，Shinji 刚一坐下便成了众人关注的中心。

"See?" said Ritsuko, pointing at him. "He spent ten minutes in the bathroom because of you. Any longer and I would have called for a medical team. It's a good thing these two teenagers aren't living with you, Misato. I might have one day had to report you for poisoning military personnel."
看吧？" 丽萨子指着他说，"他因为你已经在浴室待了十分钟。再久点，我真得叫医疗小组了。还好这两个孩子没跟你住，美里。不然我可能哪天得举报你毒害军方人员。

Misato exaggeratedly scoffed. "So rude! I slaved away over this curry and this is the thanks I get?"
“太没礼貌了！我费尽心思做的咖喱，就得到这样的感谢？”

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow at the offended woman. "If I took that to NERV right now and had the MAGI analyse it, I'm sure they'd determine it to be a biological weapon."
律子对那位感到不悦的女性挑了挑眉。"如果我现在将它提交给 NERV，让 MAGI 进行分析，我相信结果会显示它是一种生物武器。"

"Nonsense! Pen-Pen likes it, doesn't he?"
真是荒唐！Pen-Pen 明明喜欢它，不是吗？

The group turned to where the penguin had just gingerly taken a mouthful of the curry and rice in his food bowl. He suddenly stopped eating, wobbling slightly in place. There was a very faint whine, and Pen-pen keeled over like a lopped tree.
企鹅刚从食盆中小心翼翼地啄了一口咖喱饭，突然停下，身体略显摇摆。紧接着，一声微弱的呻吟响起，Pen-pen 便如断木般倒地。

"Biological weapon," Ritsuko repeated with a sigh.
‘生物武器，’律子叹息着重复了一遍。

Misato grumbled and poured more curry over her ramen. A cautious glance into the pot by Shinji showed that most of it was gone already.
三笠不满地嘟囔着，又在拉面上多浇了些咖喱。真嗣小心地朝锅里一瞥，发现咖喱已经所剩无几。

Perhaps out of pure scientific curiosity, Ritsuko ran the tip of a pinky finger around the inside edge of the pot and tasted it. She winced in disgust and reached for her beer. "Yeah. Don't invite me over again unless someone else is cooking," she said in a withering tone. "I think even your pet could do better."
或许只是出于纯粹的科学好奇，Ritsuko 用小指尖沿着锅边轻轻一抹，尝了尝，立刻皱起眉头，伸手去拿啤酒。“行了，除非有人做饭，否则别再叫我来。”她语气尖刻地说，“我看连你的宠物都能做得比这好。”

Thankfully, the rest of the dinner passed without Misato attempting to force any more curry onto somebody. Shinji ended up getting another cup of ramen, since Asuka had pointedly thrown his old one in the bin, claiming it was tainted.
幸好，晚餐剩余时间平安无事，没有再出现碇真嗣硬要别人吃咖喱的情况。因为明日香故意把他的旧碗丢进垃圾桶，说它被污染了，真嗣只好又去盛了一碗拉面。

An hour later, it was time for Ritsuko to leave.
一小时后，Ritsuko 该走了。

"Oh yes," she said, stopping at the elevator and turning to Misato and the teenagers. She patted her pockets for a few moments, before putting a hand in one and drawing out a card. "This is Rei's new ID card. I keep forgetting to give it to her. Shinji, Asuka, could one of you pass this on to her tomorrow?"
哦，对了，"她停下脚步，在电梯前转身面向美里和几位年轻人。她摸索了一会儿口袋，随后从里面抽出一张卡片。"这是绫波的新身份证，我老忘记给她。真嗣，明日香，你们明天能帮我转交一下吗？

"Um, sure. Alright." Shinji accepted the card and looked at the face on it.
"嗯，好的。" 碇真嗣接过卡片，端详起上面的面孔。

Apparently he did it for a few seconds too long as Misato began teasing him about it, waggling her eyebrows and causing his cheeks to flush. His response that he just didn't know much about the First Child didn't seem to help.
显然，他持续的时间过长，结果被碇真嗣调侃起来，她挑动眉毛，让他脸颊泛红。他辩解说自己对第一适格者知之甚少，但这似乎并未缓解尴尬。

Ritsuko's eyes turned distant as she looked at nothing for a moment, before refocusing on Shinji. "She's a bit like your father. Not very good at... living."
律子的目光变得迷离，她凝视着虚空片刻，随后目光重新落在真嗣身上。“她和你父亲有些相似，不太懂得如何生活。”

Shinji blinked at her in confusion, but she didn't offer any more explanation, instead bidding farewell and stepping into the elevator.
真嗣困惑地眨着眼望向她，然而她并未多做解释，只是道别后便踏入了电梯。

"Rei's cleared for duty now, so she's got an activation test scheduled for tomorrow," said Misato as they stopped outside her apartment door. "Can you head over early tomorrow and give her the card?"
Rei 现已获准执行任务，明天她将进行激活测试，" Misato 在他们停在公寓门口时说道。"你明天能否早点来，把卡片交给她？

"Okay," replied Shinji. He turned to Asuka. "Do... you want to come along?"
好的，" 新治回答道。他转向明日香。"你要一起来吗？

Asuka shrugged. "Sure, why not. Got nothing better to do."
明日香耸耸肩。“行啊，反正也没啥别的事。”

Misato opened her mouth, probably to claim that both of them were supposed to be going to school, but she cut herself off and sighed before saying goodnight and going into her apartment.
真嗣张开嘴，或许是想提醒两人本应去学校，但她欲言又止，轻叹一声，道了晚安后便走进了自己的公寓。

"Right, let's turn in too," said Asuka as she opened their apartment door.
"好了，我们也该休息了，"飞鸟说着，打开了公寓的门。

"Yeah..." Shinji took one last look at Rei's new identity card before following Asuka. Thoughts swirled about in his mind, one standing out among all others.
"嗯..." 真嗣在跟随明日香之前，又瞥了一眼绫波的新身份证。他的思绪如旋涡般翻腾，其中有一个念头格外清晰。

Why did Rei look so familiar? Who was it that she kept reminding him of?
为什么零的面容让人感觉似曾相识？她总是让他联想到谁呢？

XXX

Morning came, and with it the promise of another sweltering day. Shinji ended up dressing in his school uniform simply because it was the lightest clothing he could walk out of the house in. A fact which Asuka expressed some surprise at.
清晨到来，预示着又将是一个炎热的日子。真嗣最终决定穿校服出门，只因这是他家中最轻便的着装。这让明日香略感意外。

After urging him to improve his wardrobe situation, the two teenagers headed out. Fortunately, Rei's identity card had her address, as Shinji had forgotten to actually write down where she lived. When they got on the bus, Asuka asked the driver how to get to the suburb, and the man helpfully told them which connecting bus route would take them closest.
在劝说他更新衣橱后，两位少年踏上了旅程。幸好，绫波的身份证上有她的住址，因为真嗣忘了记下具体位置。他们上公交车后，明日香向司机询问如何前往郊区，司机热心地指引了最近的接驳公交线路。

Shinji and Asuka took a seat, and watched the city go by. Despite two Angel attacks most of the city seemed to be alright, thanks to the mechanisms that retracted non-essential buildings into the safety of the Geofront. The few damaged buildings were still apparently functional, but Asuka pointed out that they were the defensive blocks and chided Shinji for not knowing the locations of mission-critical buildings.
碇真嗣和明日香坐下来，目光随着城市的景色流转。经历了两次使徒的侵袭，多亏了将非关键建筑收纳入地底要塞都市的机制，城市大部分区域依旧完好。那些受损的建筑虽外观受损，但仍能运作，明日香特意指出它们属于防御区，还责备碇真嗣连任务关键建筑的位置都不清楚。

"I know where they are," Shinji retorted. "Well... mostly. But everything looks different at ground level compared to being able to see over the top of most of the buildings."
我知道他们的位置，" 真嗣反驳说。"大概吧。但从地面观察与俯瞰众多建筑的感觉截然不同。

Asuka grudgingly conceded the point.
明日香勉强接受了这一观点。

Along the way, damage from the attacks was much more noticeable as they headed away from the centre of Tokyo-3 and towards Hakone. Some areas were smashed flat, and Asuka looked at the remains of one house as they passed by it. A family was there, likely picking through the rubble for anything that could be salvaged from their former home.
随着他们远离东京-3 中心向箱根行进，攻击造成的破坏愈发显著。有些地方被彻底摧毁，飞鸟经过时，目光停留在了一栋房屋的废墟上。一家人正在那儿，或许是在瓦砾中寻找能从昔日家园中挽救的任何东西。

The bus stopped at the terminal, and Shinji and Asuka transferred to the connecting bus. It only took them a few minutes to reach the suburb where Rei's apartment was.
公交车抵达终点站后，真嗣和明日香转乘了接驳巴士。不一会儿，他们便抵达了丽公寓所在的郊区。

"Hey, is this right?" Asuka wondered as she stared up at the building.
"嘿，这真的对吗？" 阿苏卡仰望着大楼，心中充满疑惑。

Shinji took out Rei's card and double-checked the address. "Yeah, this is it."
碇真嗣取出绫波的卡片，仔细确认了地址。“没错，就是这儿。”

"But it's so... so..." 但它实在是...太...

"Decrepit," Shinji supplied. It was the most appropriate word he could think of.
"陈旧的，" 碇真嗣补充说。这是他脑海中最贴切的词汇。

Rei's apartment building, and in fact the ones around it as well, looked like they hadn't been maintained since they were first built. In the distance Shinji could hear the sounds of construction equipment, but he had a feeling they weren't in the area for repairs.
绫波住的公寓楼，连同周围的几栋，似乎自落成后便未曾修缮。远处传来施工机械的轰鸣，但真嗣隐约觉得，这些动静并非为了修补这片区域。

In fact, a sign on the front door leading into Rei's building told them just what was going to happen to it.
实际上，丽所在大楼前门的一个告示牌已经预示了它的命运。

"'Condemned'," Asuka read aloud after a moment of squinting at the sign. "'Scheduled for demolition. No trespassing.'"
'被宣告废弃，'" 飞鸟眯眼看了片刻后，大声念出标志上的字。"'即将拆除，禁止擅入。'

If the two of them had any further doubts as to where Rei Ayanami lived, the Section Two agent that met them just inside squashed them.
若他们俩对绫波丽的住址仍有疑虑，那位在门口迎接他们的第二课特工已彻底消除了这些疑问。

"We're... um... here to see Rei Ayanami?" Shinji said, his nervousness turning the statement into a question.
"我们...呃...是来见绫波丽的吗？" 碇真嗣说道，他的紧张让这句话变成了疑问句。

The black-suited man checked their identity and waved them on, returning to his post without a word.
身着黑西装的男子核实了他们的身份，挥手示意他们前行，随后默默地返回岗位。

The elevator was out of order, and somehow looked more dilapidated than the building it was in. Asuka groaned as they realised they'd have to walk up to the fourth floor.
电梯坏了，看起来比所在的楼房还要破败。Asuka 意识到得爬楼梯上四楼，不由得叹了口气。

"Shinji," she said as they started to head up the staircase. "I don't like this one bit. Is she choosing to live here?"
真嗣，" 她边说边开始上楼，"我对此一点也不满意。她是决定住在这儿吗？

"I don't know," Shinji quietly replied, although he had a vague idea who was responsible. "But can it be any worse than what we've already seen?"
我不清楚，" 真嗣低声回应，心中对责任者已有模糊的猜测。"但总不会比我们已遭遇的更糟吧？

As it turned out, it absolutely could. There was no need to check the door numbers on the fourth floor. A small pile of paper on the ground drew their attention directly to Rei's apartment door, where the mail slot was jammed with old letters and junk mail.
事实证明，确实如此。他们无需在四楼逐一核对门牌号。地上的一小堆纸张直接将他们引向了绫的公寓门前，那里的信箱口塞满了旧信件和垃圾邮件。

The two teenagers shared a worried glance, before Shinji pressed the buzzer beside the door. There was no response from inside, not even the faint sound of the receiver, so he knocked on the door instead. Even that slight tap was enough to show that something was wrong with the door, as it shifted inward slightly. Shinji looked closer at the door handle and his eyes widened slightly; the lock looked as if somebody had attempted to break into the apartment. Cautiously, Shinji and Asuka stepped over the pile of mail as he pushed the door open. The pile continued on the other side of the door, bunched up behind it against the wall.
两位少年忧心忡忡地对视一眼，接着真嗣按响了门旁的门铃。屋内毫无反应，连接收器的微弱声响也未曾响起，他便转而敲门。轻轻一敲，门便微微内移，显然有异。真嗣凑近门把手，眼中闪过一丝惊讶；锁孔处有被撬动的痕迹。两人谨慎地跨过门口堆积的邮件，推门而入。门后，邮件依旧堆积如山，紧贴着墙壁。

Inside, the curtains were partially closed, letting little light in, but that was still enough to see the state of the room. There were dirty marks all over the floor and walls, and even the ceiling in some spots.
室内，窗帘半遮半掩，光线虽弱却足以辨认房间的狼藉。地板、墙壁乃至天花板的某些区域，都留下了明显的污渍。

"Hey! Anybody home?" Asuka suddenly yelled right next to Shinji's ear, causing him to jolt in surprise. As he was about to protest, she put a hand over his mouth and furrowed her brow in concentration. After a few seconds, she said, in a more reasonable tone, "I hear running water. She's probably in the shower."
嘿！家里有人吗？" 明日香突然在真嗣耳边大声问道，让他吓了一跳。就在他准备抗议时，她用手捂住他的嘴，眉头紧皱，全神贯注。片刻后，她用更平和的语气说："我听到有水声，她应该在洗澡。

"Oh," Shinji lamely replied. "Should... we leave the card and go then?"
哦，" 真嗣有些尴尬地回应。"我们是不是该留下卡片就走？

"Are you freaking kidding?" Asuka shot him a look as dirty as the walls around them. "We're not leaving until we speak to her about this disgusting place."
你是在开玩笑吗？" 明日香狠狠地瞪了他一眼，那眼神和四周肮脏的墙壁一样。"我们不会走，除非跟她谈谈这个恶心的地方。

Shinji sighed and took another look around the small apartment. There wasn't much to see, so he started to move forward. He paused, then looked down at his feet. Shinji was about to take his shoes off before a hand on his arm stopped him. Asuka gave him the same warning look as last night, and this time he decided to listen. With the apartment in such a squalid state, who knew what could be on the floor, hidden by the dark and dingy light?
真嗣叹了口气，再次环顾这间狭小的公寓。没什么可看的，于是他开始向前移动。他停顿了一下，低头看向自己的脚。正要脱鞋时，一只手搭在他的手臂上阻止了他。明日香投来昨晚同样的警告眼神，这次他决定听从。公寓如此脏乱，昏暗污浊的光线下，地板上不知藏着什么。

A glint of light near the curtains ahead caught his eye, so he gingerly walked towards it into what seemed to be a combined bedroom and kitchen. There was a desk against a wall next to a rumpled bed, and a small clothes hanger dangling from the ceiling with socks on it.
前方窗帘旁的一抹光亮引起了他的注意，他轻手轻脚地走过去，发现那是一间卧室与厨房合二为一的空间。墙边摆着一张桌子，旁边是凌乱的床铺，天花板上还吊着一个小衣架，上面挂着几双袜子。

Shinji heard Asuka inhale sharply besides him, and then felt her poke him in the arm. He looked where she was looking, to see a box of bandages next to a mini-fridge. The blood on the bandages was so old it was practically brown. A glance at Asuka showed that she was scowling in disgust, and she quietly muttered several German words Shinji was sure his teacher would despair to hear. Frankly, he couldn't blame her for such a reaction. This wasn't an apartment; it was a hovel.
真嗣察觉到身旁的明日香突然深吸一口气，接着感到她轻戳了自己的手臂。他顺着她的目光看去，发现一个装着绷带的小盒紧靠在迷你冰箱旁。绷带上的血迹已干涸至近乎褐色。看向明日香，只见她眉头紧锁，一脸嫌恶，低声用德语咒骂了几句，真嗣敢肯定，要是老师听到这些话定会感到失望。说实话，他完全理解她的反应。这里哪像公寓，分明是个破烂的栖身之所。

The glint caught his eye again, and Shinji looked at the desk. A pair of glasses sat on the table, looking rather the worse for wear. As long as he had known Rei, he had never seen her wear glasses. Both lenses had cracks running through them, and the arms were slightly bent, but he recognised them all the same. These were the same style of glasses his father wore.
那道闪光再次抓住了他的视线，真嗣的目光落在了桌子上。一副眼镜静静地躺在那里，显得颇为破败。他认识绫波这么久，从未见她戴过眼镜。镜片上布满了裂纹，镜腿也有些变形，但他依然认出了它们。这副眼镜的款式与他父亲所戴的如出一辙。

Something compelled him to move towards the desk and pick the glasses up. After a moment spent looking at them, he put them on his face. Asuka gave a quiet but amused snort as he turned his head towards her, now standing beside the bed.
某种力量促使他走向书桌，拾起眼镜。端详片刻后，他将其戴上。当他转头望向床边的明日香时，她轻声一笑，带着几分戏谑。

"They actually kinda suit you," she said after taking a closer look at him. "Makes you look a bit older."
它们其实挺适合你的，"她仔细端详后说道，"让你显得更成熟了些。

"Really?" Shinji replied, squinting at her. The cracks did little to aid his vision, which was now slightly blurry. "I don't think they-"
真的吗？" 真嗣回应着，眯起眼睛看向她。那些裂痕对他的视力并无多大帮助，他的视线此刻略显模糊。"我觉得他们不会-

The sound of a door sliding open cut him off, and they both looked behind them. Rei was standing there, clad in nothing but a towel hung around her neck. Shinji's face started to heat up, and he began to stammer an apology.
开门声打断了他的话，两人同时回头。只见丽站在那里，仅用一条毛巾围在脖子上。真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕，结结巴巴地开始道歉。

"Shinji..." Asuka interrupted him. "Turn. Away. Now."
"真嗣...” 明日香打断他，“立刻转过身去。”

Heeding the unspoken threat in her words, Shinji quickly looked in front of him, focusing intently on the gap in the curtains as his cheeks started to burn. Behind him, he heard Asuka speak.
察觉到她话中未言明的威胁，真嗣急忙将目光投向前方，全神贯注地盯着窗帘间的空隙，脸颊不由自主地发热。与此同时，他听到身后的明日香开口了。

"Rei, why are you walking around stark nak- hey, what are you doing?"
Rei，你怎么光着身子四处走动——喂，你在做什么呢？

A hand on his shoulder spun Shinji around. Knowing that Asuka would punish him for looking, Shinji squeezed his eyes shut. He felt a hand snatch the glasses from his face, and then nothing. Not daring to open his eyes to see what was happening, he instead turned back around.
一只手搭在真嗣肩上，将他转过身来。意识到明日香会因他偷看而惩罚，真嗣赶紧闭上眼睛。他感到一只手迅速摘走了他的眼镜，之后便陷入一片空白。不敢睁眼查看情况，他只好再次转过身去。

"Rei!" he heard Asuka exclaim. "Put some damn clothes on!"
Rei！" 他听到 Asuka 喊道，"快把衣服穿上！

"Is there a problem?" Rei quietly asked. "Ikari does not seem willing to look at me."
有什么问题吗？" 绫轻声询问。"碇好像不愿正视我。

"Because you're naked!" 因为你赤裸着！

There was a momentary pause, then Rei said, "If it puts the two of you at ease, I shall dress myself now. Please excuse me, Shinji."
片刻沉默后，绫波开口：“若能让你们安心，我这就更衣。真嗣，失陪了。”

A hand on his shoulder gently pushed Shinji to the side. He shuffled to the right, keeping his eyes firmly on the wall. Next to him, he heard a drawer open. There was some rustling of clothes, then Rei spoke again.
一只手轻柔地推着真嗣的肩膀，使他侧身移开。他向右挪动，目光紧锁在墙壁上。与此同时，他听到旁边的抽屉被拉开，传来衣物摩擦的声响，接着绫波丽再次说话。

"Is this satisfactory?" 这样满意吗？

"Well your... bits are covered," replied Asuka, sounding rather shocked and hesitant. "But you need to put some actual clothing on too. Especially since there's a boy here."
嗯，你的...关键部位倒是遮住了，" 明日香有些吃惊又迟疑地说。"不过你还是得穿上点正经衣服。毕竟这里还有男生在。

"...Very well." ...非常好。

More rustling, more awkward silence. Finally, Asuka said, "Okay Shinji, she's decent. You can turn around now."
又是一阵窸窣声，接着是更长时间的尴尬沉默。最后，明日香开口道：“行了，真嗣，她已经穿戴整齐了。你可以转过来了。”

Shinji didn't move, and Asuka exasperatedly repeated herself. Nervously, he turned his head. Rei was standing behind him, adjusting the top of her school uniform. He let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and turned the rest of his body around.
真嗣一动不动，明日香不耐烦地再次开口。他紧张地扭头一看，只见绫波站在身后，正整理着校服上衣。他这才意识到自己一直屏着呼吸，随即整个身体都转了过去。

"Why are the two of you here?" Rei inquired as she sat on her bed and pulled her socks on.
"你们俩怎么在这儿？" 丽坐在床边，一边穿袜子一边询问。

Asuka blinked. "Oh! Right!" She pointed at Shinji. "First of all, he's got your new ID card."
明日香眨了眨眼，恍然大悟。"哦！对了！"她指向真嗣。"首先，他拿着你的新身份证。"

Shinji hastily reached into his pocket and pulled the card out. He showed it to Rei, who nodded at him, before placing it on her desk; he saw the glasses had been returned to their original spot.
真嗣急忙从口袋里掏出卡片，向绫波展示，她点头示意后，他将卡片放在桌上；此时，他发现眼镜已被放回原位。

"There is another reason for your presence here." It was not a question.
"你出现在这里还有另一个原因。" 这不是一个问题。

"Only because we've now seen the hellhole you live in," Asuka acidly replied. "This whole building is due to be demolished soon."
正因为我们已目睹了你那糟糕的居住环境，" 明日香尖锐地回应，"这栋楼不久将被拆除。

"It has been marked for demolition for three years," Rei replied, staring flatly at her.
"它被标记为拆除已有三年，" Rei 回答，目光平淡地看着她。

Asuka quirked an eyebrow in surprise. "Really? Wow, that's slack." She hastily shook her head. "I-I mean, that's no excuse! This place isn't fit for human habitation! I feel like I'm gonna have to get a checkup when we get to NERV because this place is so disgusting! Why are you still living here?
明日香惊讶地扬起眉毛。"真的吗？哇，这也太不讲究了。"她连忙摇头。"我-我是说，这绝不是理由！这地方根本不适合人住！我到了 NERV 得去做个体检，这里太脏了！你怎么还住在这儿？

"These are my assigned quarters. I have no need to change my residence."
这些是我分配到的住所，我没有改变居住地的必要。

"Oh yes you damn well do. You're going to catch something nasty if you stay here."
哦，没错，你肯定会。继续待在这儿，你会染上严重的病。

Rei tilted her head slightly. "Is this place really so inadequate to basic requirements?" She looked at Shinji. "Do you think so as well?"
绫波轻轻侧头，问道：“这里真的连基本条件都达不到吗？”她望向真嗣，“你也是这么想的吗？”

Asuka turned around, arms extended to take in the entirety of the hideous room. "I am honestly surprised you're not back in hospital already after contracting something contagious from this fetid hellhole. You're either incredibly lucky or have the greatest immune system in the galaxy!"
明日香转过身，双臂展开，环顾四周这间丑陋的房间。"说实话，你竟然还没因为从这恶臭之地感染上什么传染病而再次住院，我真是惊讶。你不是运气极好，就是拥有全银河系最强大的免疫系统！"

"Rei..." Shinji hesitated as Asuka's hand brushed against a wall and she recoiled as if burnt. "Honestly, you deserve better than this. Asuka and I have our own apartment next to Misato. Why don't you move out and join us there?"
绫波……" 碇真嗣顿了顿，只见明日香的手轻触墙壁，她却如遭电击般迅速收回。"说真的，你配得上更好的环境。明日香和我住在美里隔壁的公寓里。不如你也搬过来，跟我们一起住吧？

The First Child looked away. "...I do not understand why you are being so insistent."
第一个孩子别过头去，说：“……我不懂你为何如此坚持。”

"You're our friend. And you're a pilot," said Asuka. "I had a big argument with Shinji over why he shouldn't move himself into a closet just because I came along. Don't make me argue with you too."
你是我们的朋友，也是一名飞行员，"飞鸟说道。"我曾与真嗣激烈争论，反对他仅仅因为我的到来就把自己关进壁橱。别让我也跟你发生争执。

"It's because we care about you, Rei," Shinji added. "You're our friend and it pains us to see you live like this."
这是因为我们关心你，绫波，" 碇真嗣接着说。"你是我们的朋友，看到你这样生活我们感到很痛心。

Rei blinked, and looked back at him in what seemed like mild shock. "You... care about me?"
丽眨了眨眼，略带惊讶地回头望向他。"你...真的在乎我吗？"

"We do," said Asuka, stepping up to the confused First Child. She put out a hand, hesitating slightly, before patting Rei's upper arm. "Let us help you."
我们会的，"飞鸟说着，走向困惑的第一适格者。她伸出手，稍作犹豫后，轻拍了拍零的上臂。"让我们帮你吧。

Looking down at the hand on her arm, Rei traced it with her eyes up to Asuka's face. "...Alright," she finally said. "But it is not my decision."
绫低头凝视着搭在自己手臂上的手，目光顺着它缓缓上移，直至与阿苏卡的视线交汇。"...好吧，"她终于开口，"但这并非由我做主。"

"My father," Shinji almost spat. Rei nodded, and he gritted his teeth.
"提到我父亲，" 真嗣几乎要啐出来。绫波点头示意，他则咬紧了牙关。

Asuka pulled out her phone and pressed some buttons. "Screw that. Gimme a minute," she said as she held it to her ear. A few seconds later, the person she was calling evidently answered. "Hey Misato, you busy? Good. We've got a problem with Rei here. No, she's not hurt or anything. No. Not that eith- Just listen! Remember back in Germany when you told me about that one-room house you saw on duty in Columbia, with the five family members all crammed in? Well I'll bet you a year's salary that Rei's apartment is worse."
明日香掏出手机，按了几下后贴在耳边：“行了，等我一会儿。”几秒后，对方似乎接通了。“嘿，美里，忙不？那就好。绫波这边出了点状况。不，她没受伤，也不是那回事……你先听我说！记得你在德国时提过，在哥伦比亚执勤时见到的那间挤了一家五口的小屋吗？我敢肯定，绫波的公寓比那还要糟糕。”

Asuka pulled the phone away from her ear as someone shouted into it. "Well, probably. It's looking pretty shit to me at least. The whole building is condemned, and I think I saw a rat run off with one of her socks. Can you pull some strings and get her moved out?"
明日香将电话稍稍远离耳朵，因为电话那头有人在大声嚷嚷。"可能吧，至少我看这情况挺糟的。整栋楼都被贴了危楼标签，我还瞥见一只老鼠叼着她的袜子溜了。你能不能想想办法，帮她搬个地方？"

Shinji's hopes began to rise, but Asuka's sigh brought that to a halt. "Ugh, fine. We'll head to NERV now anyway. If the Commander refuses, tell him he'll have a mutiny on his hands unless he agrees to let Rei move to a livable apartment. Like... say... our building. You could also argue that it'll help with security since all three of us will be together. Alright, see you soon."
真嗣的希望刚燃起，就被明日香的叹息打断。“唉，算了。我们这就去 NERV。要是指挥官不同意，你就告诉他，不答应让零搬到像我们这样的宜居公寓，他就会面临叛乱。而且，我们三个住一起，对安全也有好处。好了，待会儿见。”

Shinji gulped. "Um... mutiny?"
真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水。“呃... 这是要叛变吗？”

Asuka nodded firmly. "Damn right. If your old man tries to make Rei stay here, you and I are going on strike."
明日香坚定地点头道：“说得好。如果老爹想让绫波留在这里，你和我可就要罢工了。”

"M-me?!" 我吗？

"Got a problem with that, Ikari? Look around, if you already need a reminder."
怎么，碇，有意见？环顾一下四周，难道还需要提醒你吗？

He didn't. The building was in such a bad state it was likely to crumble to pieces any week now. What if Rei was still inside when it happened? "Yeah, you're right," Shinji admitted. He didn't bother saying that his part of the mutiny wouldn't be very effective.
他确实没说。那栋楼破败不堪，随时都可能崩塌。万一零还在里面怎么办？“嗯，你说得对，”真嗣承认道。他没再提自己的反抗其实起不了多大作用。

"Of course I am. Anyway, let's go. Our friend has a test soon."
我当然是。好了，我们出发吧。我们的朋友马上要考试了。

Rei got to her feet and picked up her new card, then strode past them towards the front door. As she reached it, she hesitated, and turned her head slightly, looking at Asuka and Shinji out of the corner of her eye.
绫波站起身，捡起新卡片，随即大步流星地从他们身旁走过，直奔前门。抵达门前，她稍作迟疑，微微侧头，用眼角余光瞥了明日香和真嗣一眼。

"...Thank you..." she murmured before leaving her apartment, possibly for the last time.
"...谢谢你..." 她轻声说着，随后离开了公寓，或许是最后一次。

XXX

"Hey Rei," said Shinji as the three teenagers descended the long escalator into NERV. "Are you... you know... worried at all about your test today?"
嘿，绫波，" 碇真嗣边下自动扶梯边问，三个少年正前往 NERV。"你...对今天的测试感到担心吗？

"No." Rei's voice had returned to utter flatness. "Why would I be worried?"
不。" 雷伊的声音再次变得毫无起伏。"我有什么理由担心？

"Didn't you get banged up last time?" asked Asuka. "Wasn't that the reason why Shinji here got called in at literally the last second?"
"你上次不是受伤了吗？那不就是真嗣被紧急召唤的原因吗？" 阿苏卡问道。

Rei nodded. "Correct. But I am not worried."
丽点头说：“确实如此。不过我并不担心。”

"But what if your Eva goes crazy again?" Shinji nervously asked as he moved a step closer to the First Child. "I mean, it could berserk in the middle of a battle, and then what if we lose?"
但如果你的 Eva 再次发狂怎么办？" 真嗣紧张地问着，向第一适格者迈近了一步。"我是说，它可能在战斗中突然失控，万一我们因此败北怎么办？

There was silence for an awkward amount of time, before Rei finally spoke. "Tell me something." She turned to Shinji. "You are Commander Ikari's son. Do you not have faith in your father's work?"
尴尬的沉默持续了一会儿，绫波丽终于打破了沉默。“跟我说说。”她转向真嗣。“你是碇司令的儿子，难道你不信任你父亲的事业吗？”

Shinji glared harshly at her. "Of course not!"
真嗣狠狠地瞪了她一眼。"当然不是！"

The two of them stared at each other for a long time, before Rei's hand suddenly flashed out, connecting loudly with his cheek. Behind him, Asuka let out an angry shout. Shinji held a hand to his burning cheek as Rei looked shocked at what she had just done, her hand hovering in front of her face. She mumbled what was probably an apology before moving a few steps down on the escalator and away from Shinji.
两人长时间凝视彼此，突然间，绫波的手迅速挥出，重重地打在真嗣的脸颊上，发出一声脆响。身后，明日香怒吼一声。真嗣捂着灼热的脸颊，而绫波则一脸震惊，手悬在半空，似乎在低声道歉，随后在自动扶梯上向下挪了几步，与真嗣拉开了距离。

They were almost at the bottom of the escalator when Asuka's phone rang. Shinji glanced behind him at her as she answered it.
当他们快到自动扶梯底部时，明日香的手机响了。真嗣回头望去，只见她接起了电话。

"Hello? Hey Misato, got an answer for me already? ...Wait what?! Holy crap, that is some timing. Alright, I'm on my way." She snapped the phone closed. "Guess what?"
喂？嘿，Misato，这么快就有回复了吗？……等等，什么？！真是巧得离谱。行，我马上到。" 她啪的一声合上了手机。"你猜怎么着？

"An Angel is coming," said Rei.
雷说：'一个天使即将到来。'

"Yep. Misato wants me in Unit-01 five minutes ago. Your test is being put on hold."
没错。五分钟前就通知碇真嗣进入初号机了。你的测试暂时延期。

"Understood." Rei stepped to the side, clearing the way. "Go."
明白了。" 蕾侧身让开，腾出了空间。"去吧。

Shinji watched Asuka bolt down the last few steps of the escalator and then run off towards the changing room. He then looked at the back of Rei's head.
真嗣目睹明日香急匆匆地跑下自动扶梯的最后几阶，随即奔向更衣室。随后，他的目光落在了绫波的后脑勺上。

"...I guess we should head to the bridge then?"
...我想我们该去桥那边了。

There was no reply. 未收到任何回复。

XXX

The object glided serenely over the landscape, its upper surfaces reflecting the clouds above while its lower surfaces mirrored the greenery and buildings it passed over. An eerie and discordant harmony, like a ghostly chorus, filled the air, repeating every couple of seconds. Birds took to the air ahead of it, scared off by both the sound and its sheer presence.
物体在风景上空平稳滑过，上部映出云彩，下部则映出下方的绿植与建筑。空气中回荡着一种诡异而不和谐的和谐声，犹如幽灵合唱，每隔几秒便重复一次。鸟儿因这声音及其庞大存在而惊飞。

It was almost a beautiful scene, had it not been for one simple fact.
若非一个简单事实，这本可成为一幅美景。

The Fifth Angel had arrived.
第五位天使降临了。

### Chapter 10 Ramiel

"Target is in range," Aoba reported. "Now crossing the first defensive line."
目标已进入射程，" 青叶报告说。"正在穿越第一道防线。

"Unit-01 is equipped and ready to launch," Hyuga added.
"Unit-01 装备就绪，即将发射，" 日向补充说。

"Launch!" 开始！

The second the word left Misato's mouth, Unit-01 was sent hurtling towards the surface. Asuka's blood began to surge at the thought of fighting again. Another Angel, another chance to prove her worth. This Angel didn't seem like much either; a simple, if gigantic, blue diamond hovering towards some pre-determined point.
真嗣的话音刚落，初号机便被急速推向地面。想到即将再次投入战斗，明日香感到热血沸腾。面对又一个使徒，她看到了证明自己价值的新机会。眼前的这个使徒，虽庞大却简单，形如一颗巨大的蓝色钻石，正朝着预定目标缓缓逼近。

But before she even reached the surface, the next words Asuka heard told her this fight wasn't going to be easy.
然而，在明日香浮出水面之前，她听到的下一句话就预示着这场战斗绝非易事。

"I'm detecting increasing energy levels in the target!"
我检测到目标区域的能量水平正在上升！

She heard Misato gasp. "Wait, it's charging up?!"
她听到真嗣惊呼：“等等，它在蓄力？！”

The catapult slammed into position on the surface.
弹射器砰地一声固定在表面。

"Asuka, watch out!" 阿苏卡，当心！

Asuka looked towards the Angel, partially hidden behind several buildings in her line of sight, just in time to see something that made her head spin.
明日香望向天使，它部分隐匿于视线中的几栋建筑之后，恰在此时，她目睹了令她感到眩晕的一幕。

The top and bottom of the blue diamond separated and seemed to fold into nothingness, as other bits grew out of the Angel's core. Those pieces grew and disappeared as well, then after a few seconds the Angel seemed to have decided on an appropriate shape: several intersecting squares above and below the core. Asuka had no time to admire the new shape, as the core began to glow. The sky seemed to change colour as the Angel fired its weapon.
蓝色钻石的顶端与底部分离，仿佛折叠入虚空，而天使核心的其他部分则逐渐生长并消失。片刻后，天使似乎选定了恰当的形态：核心上下方交错的几个正方形。明日香来不及细赏这新形态，因为核心开始发光。天空随之变色，天使发射了它的武器。

The buildings between Unit-01 and the Angel bent and melted, gaping holes being torn through the top floors of all of them before the beam struck Asuka's instinctively raised AT-Field. Even putting all she could into maintaining the shield, she could still feel a spot of heat on her chest and had to resist the urge to rub at it.
在 Unit-01 与天使之间的建筑物弯曲并融化，所有建筑的顶层都被撕裂出巨大的洞口，随后光束击中了 Asuka 本能举起的 AT 力场。尽管她倾尽全力维持护盾，胸口仍能感受到一股灼热，她不得不抑制住想要揉搓的冲动。

"Raise the blast shield! Give her some cover!"
快升起防爆盾！给她提供掩护！

A piece of ground opened up in front of Unit-01 and a thick wall shot out of the gap, blocking the path of the beam. Asuka sighed in relief as the heat disappeared, and she watched the beam splash harmlessly against the wall in front of her. Then the beam abruptly cut off.
零号机前方的地面突然裂开，一道厚重的墙壁从裂缝中急速升起，成功阻挡了光束的行进。随着热浪的消退，明日香如释重负地叹了口气，目睹光束在前方墙壁上无害地散开，紧接着光束戛然而止。

The Angel began to shift again; first it transformed into a cross made of square blocks, then those squares stretched themselves out into angular cones. The core somehow seemed to multiply at the same time, so now there was a red orb at each point of the cross with more of the blue material hovering just beyond the points. Parts of the Angel began to spin faster and faster as Asuka heard something that sounded like a child's temper tantrum mixed with the yowling of a cat whose tail just got stepped on.
天使再次开始变形，起初它变成一个由方形块构成的十字架，紧接着这些方块拉伸成尖锐的圆锥。核心不知怎的同时进行了复制，使得每个十字架的顶点都出现了一个红色球体，而更多的蓝色物质则悬浮在顶点之外。天使的部分加速旋转，此时明日香耳边响起一种声音，像是小孩的哭闹与猫尾巴被踩时的尖叫交织在一起。

There was a brief glimmer of light emanating from the cores and converging at a point in front of the Angel, and then a new sun was born over Tokyo-3.
核心处闪现出一缕微光，在天使前方汇聚成点，紧接着，东京-3 的天际升起了一轮新日。

Entire city blocks were vaporised as the beam punched through everything in its path. The blast shield held for a few seconds before simply melting away, leaving Asuka to suffer the full force of the Angel's fury. Yet despite the city around her being bathed in fire, Asuka only felt a moderate pain over all her body, as if she had been sitting exposed in the sun too long, with a bright spot of steadily growing pain on her chest. But that pain was starting to increase. As was the temperature of the LCL surrounding her.
光束所经之处，整个街区瞬间汽化。防护罩勉强支撑了几秒便熔解消散，让明日香直面天使的怒火。尽管四周的城市陷入火海，她却只感到全身一阵适中的痛楚，犹如长时间曝晒于烈日之下，胸口一处痛感愈发强烈的亮点。然而，这痛楚正逐渐加剧，环绕她的 LCL 温度亦在升高。

"Abort! Execute emergency recovery of Unit-01!" she heard Misato shout. Asuka almost tried to tell them to just let her out of the catapult, until she heard the problem that the beam had caused.
"停止！立即对零号机进行紧急恢复！"她听到美里急切地呼喊。明日香差点想让他们直接把她从弹射器中释放，直到她得知了光束引发的问题。

"The catapult has melted! It's not responding!"
投石机竟然融化了！现在毫无反应！

Asuka experimentally tried to shift Unit-01's arms and legs. There was no resistance from the catapult restraints, which told her that those had been vaporised as well. She attempted to move, but the sheer force of the beam seemed to weigh Unit-01 down. Eventually Asuka managed to get the Evangelion to take a step to the left, but the beam was still focused precisely on her. There was no building or mountain to hide behind, and she suspected that they would get destroyed just as quickly as everything else that had stood in the way of this Angel.
明日香尝试性地操控初号机移动四肢，发现弹射装置的束缚毫无阻力，显然已被蒸发。她努力移动，但光束的强大压力让初号机举步维艰。经过一番努力，她终于让初号机向左迈出一步，然而光束依旧精准锁定。四周没有建筑或山峦可供掩护，她预感任何阻挡在这天使前的障碍都将迅速灰飞烟灭。

She was trapped, and steadily being boiled alive inside the entry plug.
她被困在插入栓内，正逐渐遭受活煮之苦。

"What about the AT-Field?" That was Akagi.
那赤木提到的 AT 力场是怎么回事？

"It's been raised to maximum and... it's holding strong! But the Angel is increasing the intensity of the beam!"
已将功率调至最大，目前稳定运行！然而，天使正在加大光束的强度！

Well hopefully this'll get her that data she's obsessed with, Asuka mused as she put what effort she could spare into not getting knocked down by the force of the attack. An irritating beep began to sound throughout the entry plug, likely some system trying to warn her of a problem she already knew about. The liquid environment of the entry plug was beginning to bubble as the internal temperature climbed, so she couldn't properly read the screens around her anyway. Something about alerts and 'Condition Red' was all she could make out.
希望这能帮她获取她所痴迷的数据，Asuka 心中默想，同时尽力避免被攻击的冲击力击倒。插入栓内响起一阵恼人的哔哔声，大概是某个系统在警告她已察觉的故障。随着内部温度的升高，插入栓内的液体开始沸腾，使得她无法清晰地查看周围的屏幕。她仅能辨认出有关警报和“红色警戒”的字样。

There was now a supernova on her chest, and her body started to feel like her skin was being gradually burnt off. As Asuka gritted her teeth against the pain, she wondered if she would still have her hair when this was over.
此刻，她的胸前仿佛爆发了一颗超新星，身体感受到皮肤正一点点被灼烧。阿苏卡紧咬牙关，强忍剧痛，心中暗自担忧这场磨难结束后，自己的秀发是否还能完好如初。

"Scrap the mission!" Misato ordered. "Initiate plug ejection!"
任务取消！" 碇真嗣下令。"立即弹射驾驶舱！

Asuka was now in too much pain to say why that was a bad idea, but Commander Ikari finally deigned to speak.
明日香此刻疼痛难忍，无法说明为何此计不妥，而碇司令终于屈尊开口。

"No. Belay that." 不，算了。

"If we eject the pilot, the AT-Field will disappear," Akagi solemnly said, giving the reason that Asuka couldn't utter. "There would be nothing to prevent the destruction of Unit-01."
如果我们让飞行员弹射出去，AT 力场就会消失，"赤木严肃地说，道出了明日香难以启齿的原因。"届时，将没有任何力量能阻止零号机被摧毁。

"...And Asuka would likely still be in danger. Damnit!" There was something that sounded like flesh hitting metal. "No other choice... Detonate explosive bolts! Initiate forcible recovery of Unit-01!"
...而且明日香很可能依旧面临危险。可恶！" 传来一阵仿佛肉体撞击金属的声响。"别无选择...立即引爆爆炸螺栓，强制回收初号机！

Asuka just barely had time to utter, "What?" before she felt the ground lurch beneath her feet as the city seemed to rise above her. Only when her immediate surroundings turned dark did she realise that 'forcible recovery' meant 'sink the entire block'. She was now hurtling down into the bowels of the Geofront.
明日香刚来得及惊呼“什么？”，脚下的地面便猛地倾斜，城市仿佛在她头顶上升起。直到四周突然陷入黑暗，她才明白“强制回收”意味着“让整个街区下沉”。此刻，她正急速坠入地下都市的深处。

"Target has ceased attack."
目标已停止攻击。

At least there was some good news. Asuka gasped as the temperature stopped rising in the entry plug, and the supernova on her chest finally disappeared. She jerkily reached up a hand to pat at the spot where it had sat for far too long, checking to see if there was a hole in her torso.
至少传来了一些好消息。明日香喘息着，感觉到插入栓内的温度不再上升，胸前的超新星终于消散。她颤抖地伸手轻触那久久停留的位置，确认自己的身体是否被穿透。

"Medical teams stand by!"
医疗团队已准备就绪！

Her entire body was on fire, and her probing fingers couldn't tell her anything. The hand fell back to her side as blackness began slowly encroaching on her field of vision.
她全身仿佛被烈焰吞噬，摸索的手指却一无所获。那只手颓然垂下，黑暗悄然侵占了她的视线。

"Asuka! Are you alright?!"
Asuka！你没事吧？！

Ah, Shinji was worried about her again. Asuka's breath caught in her throat. If they had not been playing around with a soul contract, Shinji would have been sent out there. Would he have managed to survive that attack? She could already imagine the screams of horrendous agony as he burned alive.
哎，真嗣又为她担心了。明日香的呼吸不由得一紧。若非他们正涉足灵魂契约，真嗣或许已被派遣出去。他能抵挡住那次攻击吗？她几乎能听见他惨遭焚烧时的凄厉哀嚎。

The thought of Shinji dying did something... strange to Asuka's gut.
想到真嗣可能会死，明日香心里涌起一股莫名的难受。

"Say something!" 说些什么吧！

Asuka wearily waved a hand at where she thought the viewscreen was. "I'll be fine, stop yelling at me..." She thought she heard Shinji say something else, but her shaky grip on consciousness slipped and she knew no more.
明日香疲惫地朝她认为的显示屏方向挥了挥手。“我没事，别再吼我了……”她隐约听到真嗣好像还说了些什么，但她的意识逐渐模糊，最终陷入了无知觉的状态。

Shinji stared at the girl on the bed, taking in her heavily bandaged form. He hadn't been allowed to see Asuka immediately after her retrieval from Unit-01; she had been placed into something that had looked like a coffin emblazoned with medical symbols and whisked away. All he had been able to do was wait and hope that she wouldn't be leaving NERV in one.
真嗣注视着床上那位女孩，她的身体被厚厚的绷带紧紧包裹。从初号机中救出明日香后，他未能立刻与她相见；她被放入一个类似棺材、带有医疗标记的设备中，随即被迅速转移。他只能焦急地等待，祈祷她不会就这样离开 NERV。

The medical personnel were apparently the best in the world. That, combined with injuries that hadn't been as bad as Shinji had feared, meant that Asuka was now simply sleeping off the anaesthetic. She would likely still be in some pain when she awoke, but at least she was going to be alive to feel it.
医疗团队显然是世界一流的。而且，伤势并未如真嗣所担忧的那般严重，因此明日香此刻正因麻醉而安睡。她醒来时或许仍会感到痛楚，但至少她能活着体验这一切。

Time was short, though. The Angel was predicted to break into the Geofront a few minutes after midnight, less than ten hours away. While it slowly drilled into the Geofront, Misato had gone off with Doctor Akagi and the bridge crew to work out what to do. Soon after, Rei had been rushed through her activation test and sent off in Unit-00 to collect something.
时间紧迫，使徒预计在午夜后几分钟内突破 Geofront，距离此刻不足十小时。在它缓慢钻入之际，Misato 与 Akagi 博士及桥员们一同离开，紧急商议对策。随后，Rei 迅速完成激活测试，驾驶 Unit-00 执行紧急任务。

Misato had apparently come up with a crazy plan; something about a 'Positron Rifle' was all Shinji had been able to discover. Deciding he'd only be in the way if he trailed after Misato, he had instead decided to keep an eye on Asuka, bringing a chair into her room so he could sit and wait for her to wake up. Even the strange smell coming from the bandages was not enough to put him off his vigil.
显然，美里构思了一个大胆的计划；真嗣仅得知其中涉及“阳电子步枪”。考虑到跟随美里可能只会添乱，他选择留在明日香身边，将椅子搬进她的房间，静候她苏醒。即便绷带散发的异味，也未能动摇他的守护。

Shinji's patience was eventually rewarded; he was the first face the Second Child saw when she finally groaned into wakefulness. He got to his feet and leaned over her, joyfully calling her name.
真嗣的耐心终于得到了回报；第二适格者醒来时，第一眼看到的就是他。他激动地站起身，俯身靠近，欢快地呼唤她的名字。

"Ugh, did I forget the sunscreen or something?" Asuka mumbled in German. "My skin feels like it's on fire..."
哎呀，我是不是忘了抹防晒霜？" 阿苏卡用德语嘀咕道。"我的皮肤火辣辣的...

"Um..." Shinji tried to work out how to tactfully explain her situation, but Asuka suddenly swore.
"呃..." 真嗣正琢磨着如何委婉地说明自己的情况，不料明日香突然爆了句粗口。

"Shit. Right, I got blasted." She then raised a bandaged arm up in front of her. "Well, I guess I'm alive, even if I've got the world's worst sunburn. Explains why I can smell so much aloe vera too. Hopefully I won't have to worry about peeling. Ick."
糟糕，看来我被炸得不轻。" 她举起缠满绷带的手臂，"还好，至少我还活着，虽然这晒伤可能是世上最严重的。怪不得周围都是芦荟的气味。真希望我不会开始脱皮，那太恶心了。

Shinji began to smile, but then Asuka suddenly turned a wide-eyed stare upon him. "Shinji... Am I... bald?"
真嗣刚要微笑，明日香却突然瞪大眼睛看向他。"真嗣...我...是不是秃了？"

"W-what? Can't you... you know... feel it?"
什么？你难道感觉不到吗？

Asuka gave him a disbelieving look. "Are you fucking kidding? My skin almost got melted off. I can only feel one thing and it's not pleasant, so just answer me. Do I still have my hair or not?!"
明日香一脸难以置信地盯着他，质问道：“你是在逗我吗？我的皮肤差点被烧毁。现在我只感觉到一种极其不适的感觉，你就直说吧，我的头发还在不在？！”

"Y-yes!" Shinji stammered.
"是、是的！" 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

"Prove it!" 证明一下！

Hesitantly reaching out behind Asuka's head, Shinji gave her a questioning look. When all she did was stare at him he decided to bite the bullet and grasped some of her hair, bringing it around to where she could see it. To drive the point home, he gently tugged on it several times.
犹豫着伸手到明日香脑后，真嗣带着询问的眼神看向她。见她只是默默注视，他鼓起勇气，抓起她的一缕头发，拉到她眼前。为了让她明白，他又轻柔地拽了几下。

"Okay, I felt that at least," said Asuka as she let out a sigh of relief, letting her head drop back down to the pillow. "So... what did I miss?"
好的，至少我感受到了，"飞鸟说着，如释重负地叹了口气，头再次靠回枕头上。"那么...我错过了些什么？

Relieved that her mood had improved, Shinji filled Asuka in on what little he had gleaned of Misato's plan.
看到她的心情有所好转，真嗣便向明日香透露了从美里计划中了解到的一些细节。

"A Positron Rifle, huh? Misato thinks we can bust through the AT-Field with it?"
正电子步枪啊，碇真嗣觉得我们能用它突破 AT 力场吗？

"Correct." 没错。

Shinji and Asuka turned to the door into the room, where the third member of the pilot corps was now standing.
碇真嗣和明日香转身面向通往房间的门，第三位驾驶员此刻正站在门口。

"Oh, hello Rei," said Shinji. "Um... are you here to see Asuka?"
哦，绫波，你好，" 碇真嗣说。"嗯...你是来找明日香的吗？

Rei nodded as she moved closer to the bed. "I have been sent to brief Pi- Asuka... on the details of the upcoming operation." She blinked and looked slightly away from them. "And... I wished to see if she was well."
绫点头靠近床边，说道：“我受命来向明日香简述即将行动的细节。”她眨眼间目光微偏，补充道：“另外……我也想确认她是否安好。”

"Well apart from looking like a mummy after barely escaping being boiled alive, I'm pretty damn okay," Asuka remarked. "What's the plan, anyway? Hopefully it's better than Misato's last idea."
除了看起来像刚从沸水中死里逃生的木乃伊，我还算挺好的，" 明日香说道。"那么，有什么计划？希望比美里上次的提议靠谱些。

Shinji caught the bitterness in his friend's voice. "Hey now, there was no way anybody could have predicted what that thing would do."
真嗣察觉到朋友语气中的苦涩，便说道：“哎，谁也没法预料到那玩意儿会搞出什么名堂。”

Asuka dismissively waved a hand in his face. "Yeah yeah, but I was the one who got sent up right into enemy fire. I'm allowed to feel a little cranky after almost dying, aren't I?"
明日香不耐烦地挥手挡在他面前，说道：“行了行了，可我是那个直接被派去面对敌人炮火的。差点丧命，难道还不能有点脾气吗？”

"Do you wish to seek retribution against the Angel?" Rei interjected.
"你想向天使复仇吗？" Rei 突然插话。

Something about the tone of the quiet girl's voice seemed to catch Asuka's attention. "You're goddamn right I wanna get some payback. So tell me what's going to happen."
那个文静女孩的语调似乎吸引了明日香的注意。“我绝对想报复。快告诉我，接下来会发生什么。”

"Unit-01 is being fitted with G-type sniper equipment." Rei stated.
"Unit-01 正在安装 G 型狙击装备。" Rei 陈述道。

"To use with this Positron Rifle thing I suppose," Asuka realised. "But how are we going to punch through that Angel's AT-Field from long range?"
看来得用这把正电子步枪了，" 明日香恍然大悟。"可我们如何才能从远处突破那使徒的 AT 力场呢？

"A sniper position is being prepared just outside the predicted range where the Angel automatically targets anything hostile, and preparations are being made to direct all of the nation's energy into the Positron Rifle at that position. At midnight, the operation will commence."
狙击阵地正在预测范围外筹备，届时天使将自动锁定任何敌对目标，并计划将全国能量汇聚至该位置的正电子步枪。午夜，行动正式启动。

"But will Asuka be ready by then?" Shinji nervously asked, before turning to the redhead in question. "As you keep saying, you did almost die."
但是，到那时明日香能准备好吗？" 真嗣不安地问，随即转向那位红发女孩。"你不是总说，你差点就没命了吗。

Asuka groaned. "I'm fine, you worrywart. It's just a flesh wound... that covers my entire body," she gestured at the bandages, "but otherwise I'm perfectly capable of going out there and smashing it right in its stupid... er..."
明日香呻吟着说：“我没事，你别瞎操心了。这只是皮外伤……遍布全身而已，”她指了指身上的绷带，“除此之外，我完全能出去狠狠教训它一顿，让它知道……呃……”

Shinji smiled weakly as she trailed off. Despite her injuries, Asuka was already raring to go. He turned to Rei. "Will you be going out as well?"
真嗣勉强地笑了笑，她的话音逐渐减弱。尽管身上有伤，明日香却已跃跃欲试。他转头问绫波：“你也会出去吗？”

"Yes. Both Evas are required for this operation." said Rei. "Since it will be too dangerous to engage it in close quarters, I believe my task is to do everything I can to shield Unit-01."
是的。这次行动需要两台 Eva 共同参与。" 丽解释道，"由于近距离作战风险太大，我的职责就是全力保护初号机，确保其安全。

Asuka blinked. "Uh... you did see what that thing is capable of, right? I just barely survived, and Unit-01 was ready for combat at the time. How is your Eva going to stand up to it?"
明日香眨了眨眼，问道："呃...你总该见识到那家伙的厉害了吧？我差点就没挺过来，况且当时初号机已经处于战斗状态。你的 Eva 打算怎么对付它呢？"

Shinji worriedly glanced between the two female pilots.
真嗣忧心忡忡地来回打量着两位女飞行员。

"If I die, I can be replaced," Rei quietly declared, echoing what she had already stated when the three of them had met. "The destruction of the Angels is my mission."
如果我牺牲，自有人接替，" Rei 平静地重申，与之前三人会面时的话语如出一辙。"歼灭天使乃是我的使命。

"What?!" Shinji turned in his chair to give Rei a shocked look. He just barely caught sight of Asuka sitting bolt upright in bed.
"什么?!" 真嗣猛地转过椅子，一脸震惊地望向绫波。他这才瞥见明日香猛地从床上坐直了身子。

The First Child turned to leave. As she reached the doorway, she said, "My life is nothing when weighed against all of humanity. If I must die to protect them, I shall do so without hesitation."
第一个孩子转身欲走。临至门口，她留下话：“与众生相较，我命何足挂齿。若为守护他们而须献身，我定当义无反顾。”

"Rei!" 哎呀！

"Ayanami, get back here!"
绫波，快回来！

"Goodbye." 再见。

The door closed behind Rei.
Rei 身后，门轻轻地关上了。

Shinji's first instinct was to get up and run after her, but a hand around his arm stopped him in his tracks.
真嗣本能地想要站起来追上去，却被一只手紧紧抓住了胳膊，使他动弹不得。

"Let me talk to her when I go out there," said Asuka. "I'll try to get her to stop this 'needs of the many' crap."
等我出去时跟她谈谈，" 明日香说，"我会尽力说服她别再提什么'多数人的需求'这种话了。

Settling down slightly in his chair, Shinji closed his eyes and slowly exhaled. "Why does she think her life is worthless?"
真嗣在椅子上稍作调整，闭上双眼，缓缓吐出一口气。“她为何觉得自己的生命毫无价值？”

"I don't know. Maybe your old man's done something to her," Asuka said with a shrug. Shinji turned a sharp look on her, but she didn't flinch. "Well you don't know anything about her, do you?"
我不清楚。或许是你父亲对她做了些什么，" 明日香耸肩说道。真嗣向她投去严厉的目光，然而她并未退缩。"看来，你对她的了解也是一片空白，不是吗？

"...No," Shinji sadly admitted. "It's not like she's told us about her life."
...不，" 真嗣难过地说，"她其实没怎么跟我们讲过她的生活。

"Considering that when we get even slightly curious about her, she shuts us down with 'classified' this and 'classified' that..." Asuka sighed and relaxed against her pillow, turning her head to glance at the closed door. "Don't worry, Shinji. I'll make sure she gets out of this alive as well. No Eva pilot's gonna die on my watch."
考虑到我们只要对她稍有好奇，她就会用'机密'来打发我们……" 明日香叹了口气，倚在枕头上，转头望向紧闭的门。"放心吧，真嗣。我会确保她也能平安无事。在我的看护下，绝不会让任何 EVA 驾驶员丧命。

Two hours later and the bandages were off, to Asuka's great relief. A fresh plugsuit covered up most of her skin, but her neck and face still showed some redness. Misato soon came to collect her and they headed up to the sniper position outside of Tokyo-3, where Doctor Akagi and a suited Rei were waiting.
两小时后，绷带终于被取下，明日香如释重负。她换上了全新的战斗服，虽然大部分肌肤被遮盖，但脖子和脸上仍留有淡淡的红痕。不久，美里前来接她，两人一同前往东京-3 外外的狙击位置，赤木博士和已换好战斗服的零已在彼处等候。

"Both of you have critical tasks to perform in this operation," said Misato as she began the briefing. "Asuka, you'll be the sniper in Unit-01."
你们俩在这项行动中都承担着至关重要的任务，" 碇真嗣在简报开始时说道。"明日香，你将担任零号机的狙击手。

"Yes, ma'am," Asuka replied, holding back a grin.
"好的，女士，" 明日香应道，努力不让自己笑出来。

"And Rei, you'll be on defense. Your mission is to protect Unit-01 at all costs."
另外，绫波，你的职责是防守。你的任务是无论如何都要保护好零号机。

"Understood." 明白了。

Nearby, Unit-00 was raised to the surface, a massive shield hooked onto its arm. Asuka surmised that this was their idea for giving Rei extra protection. She hoped it would stand up better than the blast shield had managed.
附近，零号机被升至地面，其手臂上挂载了一个巨大的护盾。明日香猜测这是为了给绫波丽提供额外的防护措施。她期望这个护盾能比之前的爆炸防护板更为坚固。

"This operation needs an extremely high level of precision," Doctor Akagi added. "We have no margin for error. Unit-00 hasn't been calibrated yet so even in its damaged state, Unit-01 is our best hope. Now Asuka, I assume you know enough about positrons in this situation."
这项操作对精确度要求极高，"赤木博士强调，"我们不容有失。由于零号机还未完成校准，即便初号机处于受损状态，它仍是我们的最大希望。明日香，相信你对当前情况下的正电子已有充分了解。

"Yeah, I need to take the Earth's rotation, magnetic field and gravity into account," Asuka confirmed, turning her gaze back to the woman. "And compensate for the drop over the distance when I'm aiming."
没错，我得考虑地球的自转、磁场和重力，" 明日香肯定地说，目光重新投向那位女士。"还得在瞄准时调整，以抵消距离带来的下坠影响。

Doctor Akagi nodded, something close to approval in her eyes. "When you fire, penetrate only the core. And before you ask where it is, don't worry. You'll see it when it's in combat mode. Once you're in position, we'll feed targeting data to you, so all you have to do is aim where your heads up display tells you. Do your part, and the machines will do the rest."
阿卡吉医生点头表示认可，眼神中流露出赞许。“开火时，务必击中核心。至于核心位置，不必担心，战斗模式下你会一目了然。一旦你进入指定位置，我们将提供瞄准数据，你只需依照抬头显示的指示进行瞄准。你只需做好自己的任务，其余的交给机器处理。”

As the scientist spoke, Unit-01 rolled past them, strapped down to a massive train car. Asuka glanced at it, noting that it looked pristine. It seemed like a waste of time and money to make it look better than it would perform in combat, but she wasn't in charge.
科学家讲话之际，Unit-01 被固定在巨型火车车厢上，缓缓经过他们身旁。明日香扫了一眼，发现机体崭新如初。她觉得，为了外观胜过实战性能而投入时间和资金，实在有些本末倒置，可惜决策权不在她手中。

"I must warn you," Doctor Akagi continued. "There is only one convergence point for the power. As a result, Unit-01 will be unable to move once it's in firing position."
我必须提醒你，"安吉博士接着说，"力量的汇聚点只有一个。所以，一旦 Unit-01 进入发射位置，它将无法动弹。

"So I won't be able to dodge out of the way if the Angel decides it doesn't like us existing," said Asuka, looking past all the machinery to the blue diamond in the distance. Spotlights all over Tokyo-3 were focused on it, making the city look like it was hosting a hideously expensive public event.
"如果使徒决定不容我们存在，我就无法躲避了。"明日香说着，目光越过重重机械，凝视着远方那颗璀璨的蓝色钻石。东京-3 的聚光灯齐齐对准它，使得整座城市仿佛在举办一场奢华至极的盛事。

Well, it was certainly going to be costly, not to mention difficult to cover up when the civilians emerged to find bits gouged out of the landscape.
确实，这将耗资不菲，更别提当平民们出来发现地貌被挖得坑坑洼洼时，要掩盖这一事实将极为棘手。

"Correct." 没错。

"What happens if I miss? How long will it take to charge another shot?" Asuka didn't like the idea of being stuck in place during the inevitable counterattack, but it had to be done.
"万一我失手了怎么办？再次准备射击需要多久？" 尽管飞鸟不喜欢在即将到来的反击中束手束脚，但这事非做不可。

"Don't concern yourself with what-ifs," Doctor Akagi chided. "But if you must know, it will take thirty-four seconds before you can fire again, for charging time, changing the fuse, and barrel cooling."
别去想那些假设的情况，" 阿卡吉医生提醒道。"但如果你一定要知道，你得等三十四秒才能再次射击，这段时间用于充电、换保险丝和冷却枪管。

"Or you can avoid all of that by not missing," Misato suggested. "Show us how good you are, Asuka."
或者，你也可以通过不犯错来避免这些麻烦，" 碇真嗣提议说。"让我们见识一下你的真本事，明日香。

The Second Child clenched a fist in front of her face. "You got it!"
第二个孩子紧握拳头置于脸前，兴奋地说："你懂了！"

All around the region, lights began to shut off, plunging everything into darkness. Even the Angel shelters were switched to emergency lighting as power was diverted towards humanity's greatest hope. Only the spotlights focusing on the Fifth Angel remained, as well as the lighting at the sniper position.
整个区域内的灯光陆续熄灭，四周陷入一片漆黑。即便是天使庇护所也转入了应急照明模式，因为电力正被集中用于支撑人类最大的希望。唯有第五天使周围的聚光灯和狙击点的照明依旧保持亮着。

At the hastily set up gantries near the Evangelions, Asuka and Rei sat and watched. The sight of the blue diamond above the city, lit by the spotlights, looked eerily beautiful under the starry sky, complete with a full moon.
在初号机旁匆忙搭建的横梁附近，明日香和绫波丽静静坐着，凝视着。城市上空那颗被聚光灯照亮的蓝色钻石，在繁星满布的夜空和一轮满月的映衬下，呈现出一种既美丽又诡异的景象。

Asuka glanced at Rei. The First Child's arms were wrapped around her legs, and her expression seemed as neutral as always. But having spent some time with her, Asuka believed she could see some nervousness.
明日香瞥向绫波，只见她双臂紧抱双腿，神情依旧淡漠。然而，经过一段时间的相处，明日香察觉到她似乎有些不安。

"So Rei, why do you pilot?" she casually asked, looking for something to break the awkward silence.
"那么，蕾，你驾驶的原因是什么呢？" 她随口一问，试图打破这尴尬的沉默。

Rei blinked, apparently slightly startled by the sudden question. "Why?" she echoed. "It is a bond."
绫眨了眨眼，显然对这突如其来的问题感到有些惊讶。“为什么呢？”她反问道，“这是我们之间的纽带。”

Asuka frowned at the unexpected answer. "A bond, huh? With Shinji's father?"
明日香对这突如其来的答案皱了皱眉。“一种羁绊，和真嗣的父亲吗？”

"No. With everyone." 不，是和所有人一起。

"Why don't you give a damn about surviving then?"
那你为什么对生存如此漠不关心呢？

At first it seemed like Rei was going to give an answer. Her mouth opened, then snapped shut as she got to her feet. There was something in her right hand, but Asuka couldn't make out what it was. "It is time. We should go."
起初，Rei 似乎准备回答。她张开嘴，却又立刻闭上，并站了起来。她的右手握着某物，但 Asuka 无法辨认出是什么。“时间到了，我们该出发了。”

Asuka stood up and stared at Rei. Her fist clenched as she tried to find something to say or ask, to try and understand why a fellow Evangelion pilot would care so little for their own life.
明日香站起身，目光紧锁绫波。她紧握拳头，努力寻找话语或问题，试图探明为何同为 EVA 驾驶员的绫波竟对自身安危漠不关心。

"Goodbye." 再见。

Rei left before Asuka could get a word out.
丽在明日香开口之前就离开了。

XXX

"Commence Operation Yashima! Prepare to fire the Positron Rifle! Initiate stage one connections!"
启动 Yashima 行动！准备发射正电子步枪！开始第一阶段连接！

Asuka closed her eyes as Misato shouted orders over the comm system. Replies came fast, giving status updates on the systems. Soon, the hills around Tokyo-3 lit up as distraction fire began. Missiles soared high into the sky then turned to bear on the Fifth Angel.
明日香闭上双眼，耳边是美里通过通讯系统急促的命令声。各方迅速回应，汇报系统状况。转眼间，东京-3 周边的山丘上火光四起，干扰火力已然启动。导弹腾空而起，随即调转方向，直指第五使徒。

Which responded immediately. It shifted, taking a form similar to a bicycle wheel's spokes. At the end of each spoke, blue material created a vertical spike as the entire assembly began to rapidly spin. A red beam lanced out into the sky in completely the wrong direction to the incoming missiles, but then the beam made a full sweep around in less than a second.
它迅速响应，形态转变，酷似自行车轮的辐条结构。每根辐条末端，蓝色物质凝聚成垂直尖刺，整个装置随即高速旋转起来。一道红色光束直冲云霄，起初完全偏离了来袭导弹的轨迹，然而光束旋即在不到一秒的时间内完成了一次全方位的扫掠。

The missiles detonated in midair moments later. Asuka couldn't tell if the beam had actually hit every single one, or if the missiles had committed fratricide. There was no time to ponder though, as the Angel lit up.
不久后，导弹在空中爆炸。明日香无法判断光束是否确实命中了每一枚，还是导弹间发生了自相残杀。但此刻无暇细想，因为使徒开始发光了。

The hill that the missiles had launched from flashed blueish-white before a gigantic explosion consumed it.
导弹发射的那座小山，在一场巨爆将其吞没前，闪耀着蓝白相间的光芒。

"Next volley!" 准备下一轮齐射！

Cannons from even further away than the sniper position opened fire, rounds streaking through the sky towards the target. They never made it either. The Angel reformed into a hexagonal prism and its AT-Field flashed to life. The cannon rounds bounced impotently away and the return shot, accompanied by a familiar shriek, destroyed that weapon battery as well. The pattern went on for a long minute. Emplacements would open fire, then be immediately wiped out. But there were more cannons. More missiles. More distraction from the main event.
远超狙击手位置的炮台纷纷开火，炮弹划破长空，直奔目标。然而，它们同样未能触及目标。天使变形成六角棱柱，AT 力场瞬间激活。炮弹被无力地弹开，紧接着，一声熟悉的尖啸中，反击摧毁了那处武器阵地。这样的循环持续了整整一分钟。火力点一开火，便立刻被消灭。但炮台和导弹依旧源源不断，为主战场增添了更多干扰。

"Release final safeties!"
解除最终安全措施！

"Engaging Rifle!" 互动式步枪！

Asuka cycled the bolt of the Positron Rifle, loading a fuse into the chamber. A mechanism swung a scope down over Unit-01's eye, and a similar device inside the entry plug lowered over her face. In front of her eyes, a crosshair swung back and forth as the targeting computer calculated a firing solution.
明日香拉动阳电子步枪的枪栓，将引信装填进弹膛。随即，一个机械装置将瞄准镜移至初号机的眼部，同时插入栓内也有类似装置覆盖在她的面部。眼前，十字准星来回移动，目标计算机正计算着射击方案。

Asuka began to slowly inhale and exhale. It was more psychological than physiological, due to the LCL environment oxygenating her body, but she needed to stay calm and relaxed. Just in front of Unit-01, the barrel of the Positron Rifle shifted ever so slightly as she adjusted her aim.
明日香开始缓缓地深呼吸。这更多是出于心理需求而非生理需要，毕竟 LCL 环境已确保她的身体得到充分供氧，但她仍需保持镇定和放松。在初号机面前，她轻轻调整了阳电子步枪的瞄准。

Shinji would probably be scared right now, Asuka thought to herself as she watched the Angel change forms again and again to defend against humanity. Scared of screwing something up. Well, I'll dedicate this kill to him. And afterwards, I'm gonna make sure he doesn't feel useless again.
真嗣现在大概正害怕着吧，明日香暗自思忖，目睹使徒一次次变换形态抵御人类。怕自己搞砸事情。那么，这次击杀就献给他吧。之后，我得让他不再感到自己无用。

She heard somebody counting down, and returned her full attention to the duty at hand. At the three-second mark, she held her breath.
她听见有人倒数的声音，立刻将全部注意力集中到当前的任务上。倒数至三秒时，她屏住了呼吸。

At the one-second mark, she gritted her teeth.
刚到一秒，她就咬紧了牙。

"Now! Fire!" 立即开火！

She squeezed the trigger.
她扣下了扳机。

A light show erupted behind Unit-01 as the capacitors poured their energy into the Positron Rifle. A cyan beam of energy erupted from the barrel and streaked across the landscape, the shockwave parting the water of the lake. It pierced the Angel's AT-Field like it wasn't there and went through the centre of the Angel itself, currently in the same form that had almost destroyed Unit-01 mere hours ago.
Unit-01 后方，一场灯光秀随着电容器向正电子步枪注入能量而爆发。一道青蓝色能量束从枪口喷薄而出，横扫大地，冲击波将湖水劈开。它无视天使的 AT 力场，径直穿透其核心，此刻天使正以数小时前几乎摧毁 Unit-01 的同一形态现身。

The Angel shrieked in pain as it turned into a pile of blue spikes. Dark red liquid vomited out of it, coating the area beneath it in a nasty hue.
天使因痛苦而尖叫，身体转变成一丛蓝色尖刺。暗红色的液体从其体内喷出，将周围地面染上了不祥的色彩。

"...Did we do it?" ...我们成功了吗？

Perhaps in answer to Misato's question, the Angel transformed. The spikes folded in on themselves as it returned to its original diamond shape.
或许是为了回应碇真嗣的问题，使徒开始变形。那些尖刺向内收拢，使它重新变回了最初的钻石形态。

"Are you fucking kidding me?!" Asuka exploded. "That was a perfect shot!"
你是在开玩笑吗？！" 明日香怒吼道。"那明明是绝佳的一击！

"It's charging!" 正在充电中！

"Everyone, brace for impact!"
大家注意，准备应对冲击！

The Angel transformed again. A five-pointed star grew out of the diamond, folded back in on itself and became larger and larger. It soon came to a rest; an upside down star shape with the core, now fully visible, bathing its centre bright red. It began to glow. And shriek.
天使又一次变形。一颗五角星从钻石中伸展而出，向内折叠，体积不断膨胀。不久，它静止下来，形成一个倒置的星形，其核心完全显露，中心区域被鲜红色光芒照亮。它开始发光，并发出尖锐的叫声。

Asuka blinked. "Oh fuck m-"
明日香眨了眨眼，脱口而出：“哦，糟了，我……”

The Angel fired. 天使发射了。

Half the mountain that the sniper platform was on simply evaporated. Asuka held on tight as the sniper platform was buffeted by the blast, knocking Unit-01 away from the Positron Rifle. While the blast was incredibly powerful, it was also a short one. What was left of the mountain was covered in smoke and debris.
狙击平台所在的那半边山体瞬间化为乌有。明日香紧握不放，狙击平台在爆炸的冲击下剧烈摇晃，将初号机从阳电子步枪旁甩开。虽然爆炸威力巨大，但持续时间极短。剩下的山体被浓烟和碎石所覆盖。

Asuka struggled to stretch an arm out to her controls, desperate to get Unit-01 back on its feet. She had no doubt that another attack was about to come once the Angel realised she was still alive and kicking. NERV was falling all over themselves checking systems. Unit-01's G-Type equipment was gone, but the power system was apparently still functional and already recharging. That was enough for her. She'd just have to aim manually.
明日香竭力伸手去触碰控制器，急切地想让零号机重新站稳。她确信，一旦使徒察觉到她依旧生猛，新一轮攻击必将袭来。NERV 的成员们正手忙脚乱地检查各项系统。零号机的 G 型装备虽已丢失，但动力系统似乎依旧运转正常，并已在充电。这已足够，她只能依靠手动瞄准了。

"How long?" she asked as Unit-01 hauled the Positron Rifle back to the firing position and set it down.
"需要多久？"她询问着，同时初号机将正电子步枪拖回射击位置并稳稳放下。

"Thirty seconds," Misato answered.
"三十秒。" 米萨托答道。

"Damn." Asuka pulled the targeting visor back down over her face. Her aim was more wobbly now, but through the scope she could see-
"该死。" 明日香重新拉下瞄准镜遮住脸。虽然瞄准现在有些摇晃，但透过瞄准镜，她能清晰地看到目标。

The Angel glowing again. 天使再次闪耀光芒。

"Oh, go fuck yourself you screaming blue ba-"
哦，你这尖叫的蓝色混蛋，真该自找没趣——

The Angel fired again. 天使又开了一枪。

More of the mountain vanished under smoke and fire. Asuka flinched away from the light, then wondered why she wasn't feeling anything. She looked ahead to see...
山脉的大部分逐渐被烟雾和火焰吞噬。明日香因强烈的光线而本能地避开，接着感到困惑，不明白自己为何毫无感觉。她定睛向前看去，只见...

Unit-00 was standing in front of her, shield held out to block the blast.
零号单元正站在她前方，伸出盾牌阻挡了爆炸冲击。

Asuka grinned. "Nice save, First!"
明日香咧嘴笑道：“救得漂亮，第一！”

The beam flared, and pieces of the shield disintegrated.
光束猛然闪耀，盾牌的碎片随之瓦解。

"That shield won't last much longer!"
那盾牌坚持不了多久了！

"Can we fire yet?!" 我们可以开火了吗？

"Fifteen more seconds!" 再过十五秒！

Asuka steeled herself and adjusted her aim. The Angel's own beam had thrown off her aim, so she now had to compensate for that too. But she was Asuka Langley-Soryu, genius ace pilot. Nothing was beyond her.
明日香鼓起勇气，重新调整了瞄准。天使发射的光束扰乱了她的瞄准，她必须对此进行修正。然而，她是明日香·兰格雷，天才飞行员中的佼佼者。没有什么能难倒她。

"Ten seconds!" 十秒！

She inhaled and exhaled, steadying her hand as the crosshair shifted less and less. It was almost there.
她深吸一口气，缓缓呼出，稳住颤抖的手，准星的晃动逐渐减小。目标即将锁定。

Unit-00 was now holding a piece of metal little bigger than its own head. Asuka tried to will the power system to go faster. A friend was in trouble right in front of her and it was taking too long. The last remnants of the shield quickly disappeared, and Unit-00 began to take the full force of the beam on its AT-Field.
零号机此时紧握着一块仅比其头部略大的金属片。明日香急切地催促动力系统提速。她的朋友正面临危险，救援却显得过于迟缓。护盾的残余迅速瓦解，零号机不得不依靠 AT 力场来抵挡光束的猛烈攻击。

Asuka wanted to help, but that would mean abandoning her own attack. All she could do was hope that there would be something left of Rei after this.
明日香本想伸出援手，可这等于要舍弃自己的攻势。她唯有期盼绫波丽能在这场风波后尚存一息。

"Five seconds!" 五秒！

The crosshair lined up just as the timer hit zero. Asuka growled and squeezed the trigger.
准星与计时器归零同步对齐，明日香低吼着，随即扣下了扳机。

The Positron Rifle fired, its beam cutting through that of the Angel as if it were nothing. It once again shot through the AT-Field and through the middle of the Angel. This time, it immediately morphed into the familiar diamond shape as flames belched out of its far corner, then back into the pile of spikes. Several of the spikes showed a reflection of a large red orb. Its shriek was mournful as the orb exploded, painting the surface of the Angel with red.
正电子步枪发射了，其光束轻易穿透了天使的光束，仿佛对方不存在一般。它再次穿透 AT 力场，直击天使中心。随即，它迅速变形成熟悉的钻石形态，火焰从一端喷发，接着又恢复成一堆尖刺。几根尖刺上反射出一个巨大的红色球体。随着球体爆炸，天使的表面被红色覆盖，其哀鸣声令人心碎。

"She did it!" came the exuberant cheer from Misato as the Angel toppled over, its last act being to turn back into a diamond as it came crashing to earth.
"她成功了！"随着使徒轰然倒地，最后化作一颗钻石坠向大地，碇真嗣激动地欢呼起来。

Asuka had no time to celebrate. The moment she'd seen the Angel's attack stop, Unit-01 had jumped to its feet and run towards Unit-00, now laying on the smoking ground, where it lifted the inert Evangelion up before rushing towards the lake. Steam coated the area as the water rapidly cooled Unit-00.
明日香来不及庆祝。目睹使徒攻击停止的瞬间，初号机便一跃而起，冲向躺在冒烟地面上的零号机，将其扶起后急奔至湖边。湖水迅速冷却零号机，蒸汽弥漫四周。

"Rei! Can you hear me?!"
Rei！你能听到我吗？

There was no response, but Asuka didn't give up hope yet. After a few more seconds, she pulled Unit-00 out of the water and onto the shore, placing it face down. Unit-01's hand ripped off a section of the other Evangelion's back armour, triggering its entry plug ejection sequence. As gently as if she were holding a newborn kitten, Asuka lowered the entry plug to the dirt before bending Unit-01 down so that she could eject.
尽管没有得到回应，明日香并未丧失希望。几秒后，她将零号机从水中拖至岸上，使其面朝下。初号机的一只手撕裂了另一台福音战士的背部装甲，启动了插入栓弹出机制。她轻柔地将插入栓放置在地面上，宛如呵护一只初生的小猫，随后操控初号机弯身，以便自己安全弹出。

Even the entry plug had been warped by the heat. Asuka struggled to turn the handle holding the hatch closed for several long seconds before it finally gave way. She wiped a gloved hand across her brow before sweat could drip into her eyes and blind her, then stuck her head into the dark entry plug.
高温甚至扭曲了插入栓。明日香费力地转动着关闭舱门的把手，经过几秒钟的挣扎，终于将其打开。她急忙用戴着手套的手抹去额头的汗水，以防其流入眼睛造成视线模糊，然后探头进入漆黑的插入栓中。

Rei was slumped in her chair, eyes closed and that same something still in her right hand. As Asuka took a step closer, she realised it was the same pair of cracked glasses that had been in her apartment earlier in the day. She tried to make sense of it, but gave up as she pulled Rei to her feet, slinging the girl's left arm over her own shoulder. The glasses slipped unheeded out of Rei's hand.
绫波丽无力地坐在椅子上，双眼紧闭，右手仍紧握着某物。明日香走近一看，认出那是当天早些时候在她公寓里见过的那副破损眼镜。她试图理清头绪，但最终放弃，扶起绫波，让她的左臂搭在自己肩上。眼镜悄然从绫波手中滑落，无人察觉。

Asuka heard a groan, and looked at Rei's face just as the girl opened her red eyes. She huffed as she carried Rei out of the entry plug.
明日香听到一声呻吟，随即看到绫波丽睁开了她那双红色的眼睛。她喘着粗气，将绫波丽从插入栓中抱了出来。

"Don't ever let me hear you say that your life is worthless again," she angrily stated. At Rei's puzzled look, she continued. "Maybe you can be replaced. Maybe somebody else could pilot your Eva. But there is no goddamn way that somebody could replace a friend."
别再让我听到你说自己的生活毫无价值，"她怒气冲冲地说。见绫波一脸困惑，她接着说："或许你能被替代，或许别人也能驾驶你的 Eva。但绝不可能有人能取代一个朋友的位置。

Lowering Rei gently to the ground just outside the plug, Asuka looked up the hill at some lights that were gradually making their way down. She turned back to the girl on the ground. "And what the hell was that 'goodbye' thing about?! You made it sound like you had no intention of seeing me or Shinji ever again!"
将绫波轻轻放在插入栓外的地面上，明日香抬头望向山坡上逐渐向下移动的灯光。她转回身看着躺在地上的女孩，质问道：“你那句‘再见’到底是什么意思？！听起来好像你再也不打算见我和真嗣了似的！”

Rei struggled to sit up. "I... am sorry," she weakly replied.
蕾努力坐起身来，声音微弱：“我……真的很抱歉。”

"Make sure you apologise to Shinji too. You left him in a bit of a state when you left like that." Rei looked away, a hint of shame on her face. Asuka lightened her tone. "Well anyway, it's over. Angel's dead, we're all alive... what now, huh?"
记得也要向真嗣道歉。你那样突然离开，让他挺难受的。" 绫波移开视线，脸上闪过一丝愧疚。明日香语气变得轻松，"总之，事情已经结束。天使被击败，我们都安然无恙...接下来该做什么呢？

"I do not know." 我不知道。

Asuka tsked at the lame answer. "We've won, but you look like you're waiting for a doctor's appointment. Aren't you happy at all?"
明日香对那个不怎么样的回答啧了一声。“我们赢了，可你看起来像是在等看病。难道你一点都不开心吗？”

Rei blinked. "I... believe so. But I am not sure what to do in this situation."
零眨了眨眼，说：“我……应该是这样。不过，我不太清楚这种情况下该怎么办。”

"Ugh, you're hopeless." Asuka almost buried her face in her hands, but abruptly changed her mind when she saw the state of her plugsuit's gloves. They had been half-melted by the heat of the entry plug, and underneath her hands were also stinging. She settled instead for placing them on her hips.
"唉，你真是无可救药。" 明日香本想捂脸，但瞥见自己插入栓服手套已因高温半熔，手心也隐隐作痛，便改将手叉在腰间。

"Well, when me or Shinji are happy or satisfied or whatever, we smile. Why not try that?"
当我们感到高兴或满足时，我和真嗣通常会微笑。你也可以试试看。

Rei gave a small gasp of surprise and looked up at Asuka, who smiled the smile of a job well done and held a hand out. After some hesitation, the corners of the First Child's mouth turned upwards into what was probably the first smile she had ever given. She reached out and grasped Asuka's hand, and the redhead pulled Rei to her feet, pretending that she didn't feel the sting in that hand.
绫波轻声惊呼，抬头看向明日香，后者带着任务完成的满意微笑伸出手。经过短暂的犹豫，第一适格者的嘴角终于上扬，这可能是她首次展现的笑容。她伸手握住明日香的手，红发少女则用力将她拉起，假装没有感觉到手上的刺痛。

"Now that that's out of the way, let's get the hell out of here."
那件事既然已经处理完了，我们快点离开这里吧。

They met the approaching NERV personnel halfway up the hill. Misato was in the lead, Shinji by her side, and Ritsuko was close behing. As soon as Misato spotted the two female pilots, she took off towards them, barrelling down the hill like an out of control train. Asuka barely had time to react as she was swept up into a crushing hug. Misato immediately began babbling happy things into her ear as she spun the Second Child around.
他们在半山腰与 NERV 的人员相遇。碇真嗣紧随其后，而律子紧跟其后。一见到两位女飞行员，她便如脱缰的野马般冲下山坡。明日香几乎来不及反应，就被卷入了一个紧得令人窒息的拥抱中。她立刻在明日香耳边滔滔不绝地说着开心的事情，同时将第二适格者转了个圈。

Just as she was starting to get dizzy, Asuka found herself back on solid ground again. Nearby, Shinji and Rei had met up, and Shinji seemed somewhat surprised by the smile on Rei's face. Stepping up towards them, Asuka put an arm around both of them.
就在她开始感到头晕目眩之际，明日香发现自己再次踏上了稳固的地面。不远处，真嗣与绫波相遇了，真嗣对绫波脸上的微笑显得有些意外。她走上前去，一手揽住两人的肩膀。

"I think it's past time we head home." She glanced at Misato. "I'm taking Wondergirl here back to our apartment block. If the Commander has anything to say about it, tell him I said 'Kiss my ass, we just saved the world'."
我想是时候该回家了。"她看了看美里，"我要带这位神奇女孩回我们的公寓。如果指挥官有话说，就告诉他，我说的'让他亲我的屁股去吧，我们刚拯救了世界'。

Misato seemed about to say something, nervously raising a hand, but Asuka turned herself and the other two teenagers away and walked them off.
美里欲言又止，紧张地举起手，然而明日香已转身，领着另外两名少年离去。

"...Wondergirl?" Rei quietly said.
"...少女？" 丽轻声说道。

If anybody heard her, they took no notice of it.
即便有人听见她的话，也并未予以理会。

### Chapter 11 The NERV Of Some People...

A new day dawned on Tokyo-3, reflecting off the new addition to the scenery that was the corpse of Ramiel.
第三新东京市迎来了新的一天，晨光映照着雷米尔的遗骸，成为这片风景的新元素。

What remained of the blue diamond was still incredibly massive; it would take too many workers too much time to break it down into shippable pieces, so the decision had been made to leave it be for the time being. Plans were being made for attempts to either airlift it out of the city, or even to get the Evangelions to try and carry it.
蓝钻残余部分依然庞大无比，分解成可运输小块需耗费大量人力和时间，故决定暂缓处理。现正筹划通过空运或甚至动用福音战士来尝试将其移出城市。

Shinji yawned as he got up, throwing aside the thin sheet that was all he'd needed during the recent warm nights. Through his bedroom's open window, he could faintly hear the sounds of heavy machinery as repairs and reconstruction began in Tokyo-3.
真嗣打着哈欠从床上爬起来，随手把最近夜里仅盖的薄被单甩到一旁。他卧室的窗户敞开着，隐约传来东京-3 正在进行修复和重建的沉重机械声。

The Fifth Angel had caused massive damage to the city itself, mostly when it had first attacked Unit-01, and chunks had been taken out of almost every hill surrounding Tokyo-3. There was also a hole in the city at the spot where NERV had triggered the explosive bolts and sunk an entire city block to get Unit-01 away from the Angel. Shinji wondered on the logistics of fixing something like that as he headed to the bathroom.
第五使徒对东京-3 造成了严重破坏，尤其在初次攻击初号机时，几乎环绕城市的每座山丘都留下了巨大的缺口。此外，在 NERV 为了将初号机与使徒隔离而引爆爆炸螺栓、下沉整个街区的地方，城市中还留下了一个巨大的坑洞。真嗣在走向浴室的途中，不禁思索起这样的破坏该如何修复。

After performing some morning necessities, it was time to prepare breakfast. He was halfway done when he realised two things: that he'd now have to start making enough for one extra person, and that he would likely be the only one eating this early.
处理完早晨的琐事后，他开始准备早餐。做到一半时，他突然意识到两件事：一是他得开始准备多一份早餐，二是这么早可能只有他会吃。

There was no word yet from his father on whether or not Rei would be allowed to stay with them, but that hadn't stopped Asuka. The adrenaline high from her victory had worn off quickly, so she had simply sent Rei to bed in Shinji's old room before heading next door and falling into bed. That had been around two in the morning. Considering what they had just been through, Shinji predicted that both female pilots would not be awake before noon.
绫是否能与他们同住，父亲尚未给出答复，但这并未影响明日香的行动。她因胜利而激发的兴奋迅速消散，便安排绫睡在真嗣的旧房间，随后自己走到隔壁，倒头便睡。时间已近凌晨两点。鉴于他们刚经历的波折，真嗣推测两位女驾驶员中午前都不会醒来。

An hour later, he ended up being only half right.
一小时后，他发现自己的判断只有一半正确。

The doorbell chimed as Shinji was catching up on his homework, and he got up to open the door, expecting it to be Misato. He was therefore rather surprised to see Rei standing there.
真嗣正在赶作业，突然门铃响起，他起身去开门，本以为是美里。然而，站在门外的却是绫波，这让他颇感意外。

"Uh, good morning Rei." 早上好，绫。

Rei returned the greeting, adding, "Pi- Asuka said that I should come here for breakfast when I wake up."
绫回应了问候，并补充说：“皮- 明日香建议我醒来后到这里吃早餐。”

"Oh. Of course," Shinji lamely replied. "But... did you get enough sleep? Last night was rather, um... busy."
哦，当然，" 真嗣有些尴尬地回应，"不过……你昨晚休息好了吗？昨晚确实挺忙的。

"I am feeling sufficiently refreshed." Indeed, Rei seemed perfectly fine, though her school uniform was a bit rumpled.
"我感到已经充分恢复了。" 确实，Rei 看起来一切如常，只是校服略显皱褶。

"Well, um, come on in then."
嗯，那就进来吧。

Rei gave a little bow, and followed Shinji to the kitchen. Shinji began heating up what would have been Asuka's portion of breakfast, reasoning that he would have to make something later anyway, before remembering something crucial.
绫波轻轻鞠躬后，跟随真嗣走进厨房。真嗣着手加热原本属于明日香的那份早餐，心想反正迟些还得准备别的，这时他突然记起了一件重要的事。

"Er, sorry," he said, turning to Rei. "I forgot that the miso soup has fish stock. Would you like something else to go with the rest of your breakfast?"
哎呀，不好意思，" 他转向零说道，"我忘了味噌汤是用鱼汤做的。要不要换点别的来配你的早餐？

"That is alright," Rei replied. "I am never very hungry in the morning, so there is no need to make a substitution."
没关系，" 雷回答说，"我早上一般不太饿，所以不用替换。

Shinji nodded and turned back to preparing the meal, setting the miso soup aside. There was still rice and vegetables, so she certainly wouldn't be starving by lunch time.
真嗣点头后，继续准备饭菜，将味噌汤搁置一旁。手头还有米饭和蔬菜，午餐时分她定然不会挨饿。

Rei's attitude towards breakfast seemed to mirror his own somewhat, in that he didn't eat much either. Just recently Shinji had had to start wearing one of his teacher's old belts in order to keep his trousers up. Before learning of his lack of taste sense, Asuka had once declared that he ate like a bird. Guiltily remembering what she had... strongly requested of him after finding out, he prepared another bowl of rice for himself as well.
绫对早餐的态度似乎与他有些相似，两人都不怎么吃。最近，真嗣不得不开始用他老师的一条旧皮带，才能让裤子不掉下来。在得知他失去味觉之前，明日香曾戏称他吃得像小鸟。他内疚地记起明日香得知真相后对他的强烈要求，便也为自己盛了一碗米饭。

Shinji let Rei eat in peace as he took his bowl of rice and returned to his homework. Soon afterwards, he heard a tap turn on and went to the kitchen to tell her that she didn't need to do the dishes as well, but she merely replied that she wanted to in return for the meal. Realising that she was not going to budge on this, Shinji simply let her work.
碇真嗣让绫波丽安心用餐，自己则端起饭碗继续做功课。没过多久，他听到水龙头被打开的声音，便前往厨房告诉她不必连洗碗也包揽，然而她只是淡淡地回应，这是为了答谢这顿饭。看出她心意已决，碇真嗣便不再坚持，任由她去忙碌。

Not long afterwards, there was another distraction. What Shinji took to be Rei's phone rang, and he heard her talk quietly. After a few minutes, Rei came into the lounge room where he was staring at his maths homework.
不久，又一阵干扰打断了他的思绪。真嗣听到铃声以为是绫波的手机，她轻声应答着。几分钟后，绫波走进客厅，真嗣正对着数学作业发愣。

"It appears my transfer has been officially approved," she said.
她说：'看来我的转岗申请已经正式通过了。'

"Oh?" Shinji brightened up. "My father agreed to you moving here?"
哦？" 真嗣顿时来了精神。"我父亲同意你搬过来了？

"I believe it has something to do with the fact that my former home has collapsed."
我认为这可能与我的旧家倒塌了有关。

If Asuka had been awake, Shinji knew she would have made a sarcastic comment about this turn of events.
倘若明日香醒着，真嗣清楚她必定会对此变故嘲讽一番。

"Apparently an artillery shell hit the building. NERV believes it may have been deflected by the Fifth Angel's AT-Field."
显然，一枚炮弹击中了该建筑，NERV 推测可能是被第五使徒的 AT 力场所偏转。

"Well..." Shinji was somewhat lost for words. "I... guess that's one way of solving the problem?"
嗯……" 真嗣一时语塞。"我……这或许也算是一种解决办法吧？

Rei gave him an unreadable look. "I will need to requisition new clothing, as I only have what I am currently wearing."
丽投给他一个难以解读的眼神。“我得申请些新衣服，毕竟我现在只有身上这套。”

"I... think that's something you'd be better off speaking to Asuka or Misato about. They can tell you where to get new clothes, and help you pick things out."
我觉得这事你最好直接咨询明日香或美里。她们知道哪里能买到新衣服，还能帮你挑选合适的。

"In that case, I will speak to Captain Katsuragi." Rei looked in the direction of Misato's apartment. "It looks like she has just woken up."
既然如此，我会去找葛城队长谈谈。" 绫波丽看向了美里的住处。"看来她刚起床。

Shinji gave a slight chuckle. "Did you just hear her stomping towards her kitchen?"
真嗣轻笑一声，问道：“你听见她咚咚地往厨房去了吗？”

"No."

His humour faded quickly. "Oh right. Your... er, soul vision thing." Rei nodded. "You can even see people through walls?" Another nod. "Doesn't that get... I don't know... irritating sometimes?"
他的幽默感很快消失了。“哦，对了，你的...那个，灵魂视觉能力。” Rei 点头确认。“你甚至能穿墙看到人？” 再次点头。“那样不会...怎么说呢...有时候觉得烦吗？”

"I have learned to adapt," Rei replied. "But it was impossible to ignore the state of you and Asuka when I first met you face to face."
我已学会适应，" 绫波回应说，"但初次与你和明日香面对面时，你们的状态实在难以视而不见。

"Yeah... easy to understand why..." Shinji glanced at his homework, then back to Rei. "Well, since Misato's awake, I'll go heat up her breakfast now."
嗯... 确实不难理解。" 真嗣看了看自己的作业，又转向绫波说："既然美里已经醒了，我去帮她热一下早餐。

As he was about to get to his feet, Rei held up a hand to stop him. "Since I need to speak to her, I can bring the food to her. Please tell me what needs to be done."
就在他准备起身之际，零伸手制止了他。“既然我得和她谈谈，我可以把食物送过去。请告诉我该怎么做。”

Once again realising that Rei wanted to do this, Shinji nodded and told her how to properly warm up Misato's breakfast. The First Child left, and he went back to staring helplessly at his homework.
再次察觉到绫波的意愿，真嗣点头示意，并指导她如何恰当地加热美里的早餐。绫波离去后，他再次无助地凝视着自己的作业。

A few hours later, Asuka came out of her bedroom. Shinji, desperate for any kind of stimulus that wasn't numbers, turned to greet her.
几小时后，明日香走出了她的卧室。真嗣，极度渴望摆脱数字的束缚，转过身来迎接她。

"Good mor- uh, afternoon, Asuka," he said correcting himself after glancing at the clock.
"早上好——哦，不对，下午好，明日香，"他看了眼时钟，随即纠正了自己的问候。

Asuka mumbled something that might have been 'morning' as she slowly walked towards the kitchen, one hand trying vaguely to keep her hair out of her face. Shinji practically threw his homework to the side as he got up and headed to the kitchen as well to start on lunch. He got there in time to see Asuka flick on the kettle before heading to the bathroom.
明日香含糊地嘟囔着，可能是“早上好”，她缓缓走向厨房，一只手随意地试图将头发从眼前拨开。真嗣急忙把作业丢到一旁，也起身前往厨房准备午餐。他刚好赶上，目睹明日香打开水壶后转身去了浴室。

With almost perfect timing, a slightly less tired Asuka exited the bathroom just as the kettle boiled and turned itself off. Soon, Asuka was leaning over a hot cup of coffee at the dining table. Shinji began making small talk, asking if she slept well and such, and mostly got monosyllabic responses until Asuka had the chance to drink some coffee and properly wake up. He took that moment to tell her about what had happened to Rei's apartment, to which she cackled.
时机恰到好处，略显疲惫的明日香刚好在水壶烧开自动断电时从浴室走出。很快，她便在餐桌旁俯身于一杯热咖啡前。真嗣开始闲聊，问她睡得如何等，起初多是简短回应，直到明日香喝了咖啡，精神逐渐恢复。这时，真嗣告诉她绫波的公寓出了什么事，她听后不禁笑出声来。

"Hah! Close enough to what I would have done if I could have gotten away with it," she said. "So she's officially staying here now?"
哈！跟我原本打算做的差不多，如果我没被发现的话，"她说。"那她现在是正式留在这儿了？

Shinji nodded. "Yes, but she said she's going to need new clothes now."
真嗣点头说：“对，她提到现在得买新衣服了。”

That got Asuka's attention. "Did I just hear someone say shopping?"
那句话吸引了明日香的注意。"我是不是听到有人说要去购物了？"

"No- well, yes, she's going to-"
不，其实，是的，她正准备去-

"I distinctly heard you mention a shopping trip."
我确实听到你提到了要去购物。

"What? I-" 什么？我...

"Of course you can come along, Shinji!"
当然可以，真嗣，一起来吧！

Shinji blinked slowly at Asuka. "...If I say anything else, am I going to be in more trouble?" He immediately regretted opening his stupid mouth.
真嗣缓缓眨眼，望着明日香。“...我若再多言，会不会惹来更多麻烦？”他顿时懊悔自己不该多嘴。

"What's that? You're offering to carry our stuff? Thanks!"
那是怎么回事？你要帮我们搬东西吗？太感谢了！

With a despairing groan, Shinji tried to take as long as possible to make the grinning redhead's lunch.
真嗣绝望地呻吟着，尽量拖延时间，为那咧嘴笑的红发女孩准备午餐。

Perhaps because she was full of food and beer, Misato agreed immediately to Asuka's request to go shopping for Rei. However, she didn't even have the decency to look apologetic when she learned the unfortunate fate of Shinji.
可能因为吃饱喝足了，明日香提出为绫波丽购物时，美里毫不犹豫地答应了。但得知真嗣的不幸遭遇后，她甚至没有表现出应有的歉意。

Just as they were about to head off, Asuka suddenly turned to Misato and asked, "Hey, these cards are smart enough to pay in the local currency, right? I don't know if they'll use yen if I try to buy something here."
就在他们即将启程之际，明日香突然转向美里问道：“嘿，这些卡能智能地使用当地货币支付吧？我不确定在这里购物时，它们是否会自动使用日元。”

With a scoff, Misato replied, "What did I say about giving NERV some credit? We can use our cards anywhere in the world. With how much some employees have to move around, it'd be a waste of time and money to deal with currency conversion every time they jump on a plane. Just swipe the card and the appropriate amount gets deducted from your account. Don't even have to pay a fee for the conversion."
碇真嗣带着一丝嘲讽回应：“我不是提醒过你吗，要对 NERV 有点信心。我们的卡在全球各地都能用。想想那些频繁出差的员工，每次飞都要换货币，多费时费钱啊。刷一下卡，钱就直接从账户扣了，连兑换费都不用付。”

"That's a relief." Asuka frowned as she quickly glanced at Shinji. "Hey, is Shinji getting paid too? Before he got to start joining us in training and tests, he kept saying he wasn't a pilot, and it's got me wondering if NERV was actually paying him during that time."
那真是让人松了口气。" 明日香皱眉，快速地看了真嗣一眼。"喂，真嗣也有工资拿吗？他加入我们训练和测试之前，总说他不是飞行员，我就在想，那段时间 NERV 是不是真的给他发工资了。

Misato threw her beer can in the bin, once again without looking. "Shinji's been an employee of NERV since he arrived in Tokyo-3. Despite his... uh... handicap, he has been drawing pay as an Evangelion pilot, and received a combat bonus for his efforts against the Third Angel." She gave them a cheeky smirk. "I saw how much you guys get paid. If you hadn't moved next door I might have started charging rent!"
碇真嗣自从来到第三新东京市，就一直是 NERV 的员工。尽管他有...呃...缺陷，但他作为 EVA 驾驶员一直在领取薪水，并且因为对抗第三使徒的努力而获得了战斗奖金。她向他们调皮地笑了笑。我看到了你们的薪水。如果你们没有搬到隔壁，我可能会开始收房租了！

"Er, how much do we get paid?" Shinji inquired.
"嗯，我们能拿到多少报酬呢？" 真嗣询问道。

When Misato rattled off some numbers, Asuka's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Shinji, meanwhile, simply asked, "Is that a lot?"
美里一口气念出一串数字，明日香惊讶地挑起了眉毛。而真嗣则在一旁问道：“那算是很多吗？”

Asuka turned to him with a look of bemusement. "'Is that a lot', he asks." She tsked and shook her head. "We're getting paid about three times more than a JASDF fighter pilot."
明日香转头看向他，一脸茫然。“‘这算多吗？’他问道。”她咂了咂舌，摇摇头。“我们拿到的报酬差不多是日本航空自卫队战斗机飞行员的三倍。”

"Oh. Um..." 哦，呃...

"Put it this way, Shinji," said Misato. "If I wanted to buy a brand new car right now, I'd be paying it off for years. You, on the other hand, could probably own it by this time next year." She paused. "Oh wait, hang on. NERV decided a trust fund was required for you three since you're minors."
这么跟你讲，真嗣，" 美里说道，"如果我现在买辆新车，得还贷好几年。但你，可能明年这时候就能全款买下了。" 她顿了顿，"哦，不对，等等。NERV 考虑到你们还未成年，决定为你们设立一个信托基金。

Asuka sighed and shrugged theatrically. "They trust us enough to sit inside their multi-billion dollar war machines, but not enough to pay us like normal people." She shook her head, then switched to German. "The NERV of some people..."
明日香叹了口气，夸张地耸了耸肩。“他们放心让我们驾驶那些价值连城的战争机器，却不愿像对待普通人那样支付我们报酬。”她摇摇头，随后改用德语说道：“某些人的 NERV，真是……”

Misato and Shinji both laughed a little at the horrible pun.
真嗣和美里都被这个糟糕的双关语逗得微微一笑。

A minute after Asuka and Shinji left to get ready for the outing, Misato was getting another beer out of the fridge when somebody suddenly spoke up from behind her.
明日香和真嗣离开去准备外出后不久，美里正从冰箱里取啤酒，突然有人从背后对她说话。

"Will I be required to pay rent?"
我是否需要支付租金？

Misato jumped, banging her head against a fridge shelf. Rubbing at the sore spot, she turned to face the speaker. "Damn, Rei, could you be any sneakier?"
真嗣一跃而起，头不慎撞上了冰箱搁板。她揉着撞疼的地方，转头看向说话者。“真是的，绫波，你就不能更光明正大点吗？”

"It was not my intention to startle you. My apologies," said Rei, giving a small bow.
"我并无意吓到你，抱歉，" Rei 说着，微微鞠躬表示歉意。

Waving off the apology, Misato replied, "It's fine. Just... try and make at least a little noise when you move around. I'm still not exactly used to having someone living in the same place as me."
摆手示意不用道歉，Misato 回应道：“没事的。只是……你动的时候尽量弄出点声响。我还没完全适应和别人同住。”

Rei nodded, then repeated her question.
丽点头后，再次提出了她的问题。

"Nah, I was just having a bit of a joke with those two. I'm not expecting you to pay to stay here, especially when your own place got destroyed."
其实，我刚才是在跟那两位逗趣。你不用为住这儿掏钱，毕竟你自己的住处都毁了。

Someone, most likely Asuka, banged on the front door. Misato glanced in that direction then back at Rei. "Well, they're ready, so off you go. Try not to have too much fun!"
有人，多半是明日香，用力敲响了前门。美里朝那边望了一眼，随即又看向绫波，说道：“看来他们都准备妥当了，你出发吧。记得别玩过头了！”

"I shall try to keep the level of entertainment subdued," said Rei, heading out of the kitchen.
"我会尽量让娱乐保持低调，" Rei 说着，走出了厨房。

Misato watched the girl leave. A minute later, right as her phone began to ring, she asked the empty room, "Did she just make a joke?"
真嗣目送女孩离去。一分钟后，恰逢手机铃声响起，她对着空无一人的房间问道：“她刚才是不是在开玩笑？”

Luckily for Shinji, the nearest shopping centre was relatively close to their apartment. Even more luckily, it seemed as though Asuka wasn't going to go as crazy with purchases as he had been dreading; he was only carrying four relatively light bags after an hour of following Asuka around. The two teenage girls had only gone into three shops before Asuka declared Rei's new wardrobe to be satisfactorily filled, and her own to be sufficiently expanded for the time being.
幸运的是，真嗣发现最近的购物中心离他们家并不远。更让他松口气的是，明日香并没有像他预想的那样大肆购物；一个小时下来，他手里只拎着四个不算重的购物袋。两位少女逛了三家店后，明日香便满意地表示绫波的新衣橱已经充实，而她自己的衣物也暂时够用了。

Rei herself seemed somewhat nonplussed at the attention Asuka was giving her, and had taken to clutching one of the bags of clothing to her chest. Shinji could just barely make out something light blue through the plastic bag.
绫波丽对明日香的关注显得有些不知所措，她紧紧抱着一袋衣物，将其紧贴胸前。真嗣透过塑料袋隐约看到一抹淡蓝色。

The First Child's blue hair and red eyes had attracted some odd looks, but it never went any further than that, and Rei was either completely unaware or simply didn't care about the reactions of strangers.
第一个孩子的蓝发红眼虽引来了一些异样目光，但并未引起更多关注，而丽要么是浑然不觉，要么就是对旁人的反应毫不在意。

As the three pilots took a refreshment break, Shinji asked Asuka about Rei's behaviour. In a low voice, she explained that Rei had originally intended to only get seven sets of school uniforms; apparently that was all Rei had owned in the past and she hadn't seen a need to change that. Asuka had then patiently explained that she deserved more than that, before asking for Rei's favourite colour and finding something that the quiet girl had actually taken a liking to even if, in Asuka's opinion, the colour absolutely did not suit her complexion.
三位飞行员休息时，真嗣向明日香打听绫波的举止。明日香低声透露，绫波起初只想购置七套校服，这曾是她过往的全部，她觉得无需改变。明日香耐心劝导，认为绫波值得拥有更多，随后询问她钟爱的颜色，并挑选了一款绫波真心喜欢的款式，尽管在明日香眼中，那颜色与绫波的肤色并不相称。

Asuka had had to stop her from getting seven sets of that too.
明日香还不得不阻止她买七套那东西。

"Alright, we've still got more to do," Asuka declared, throwing her empty drink bottle behind her in a mimicry of Misato. The sound of the bottle clattering on the ground showed how experienced she was compared to the expert, and she sighed as she got up to put it in the bin properly.
"好了，我们还有不少事要做，"明日香说着，模仿美里的样子将空饮料瓶向后一抛。瓶子落地时的响声暴露了她与行家之间的差距，她轻叹一声，起身将瓶子捡起扔进垃圾桶。

"What now?" Shinji wondered, depositing his bottle in the bin in a much more normal manner. "You two have your clothes." He hefted the bags for emphasis.
"接下来怎么办？" 真嗣思索着，以一种更自然的方式将瓶子投入垃圾箱。"你们俩的衣服都在这儿了。" 他提起袋子强调道。

"We do, but you don't."
我们做，而你却不做。

"Huh? ...Oh..." 嗯？...哦...

Shinji had been putting off getting more clothing for himself both due to not really wanting to, and not knowing if he even had the money to spare. Now that he knew what his pay situation was like, it seemed like there was no excuse.
真嗣之前一直因为不太情愿，加上不清楚自己是否有闲钱，而迟迟未给自己添置新衣。如今他已了解自己的收入情况，似乎再无理由推迟此事。

Asuka began to head off. "Yeah, I haven't forgotten that you don't have much besides uniforms. We may as well get you sorted out today as well, so come along."
明日香动身出发。"嗯，我没忘记你除了制服也没多少其他衣服。我们今天也顺便帮你打理一下，跟我来吧。"

"Yes, Asuka," Shinji said with a sigh.
"是的，明日香，" 真嗣叹了口气说道。

XXX

Shinji was glad that clothing was light. With three bags in each hand, it already felt like he was carrying razor wire attached to weights. But at least the shopping trip was over.
真嗣庆幸衣物轻巧。双手各拎三个袋子，仿佛提着绑有重物的锋利铁丝。所幸购物之旅总算告一段落。

Mostly over, at least. They still needed to get back home. And when the three pilots reached the shopping centre's car park, they ran into somebody that Shinji was not exactly happy to see.
大致上算是结束了，至少暂时如此。他们还得返回家里。当三位飞行员抵达购物中心的停车场时，他们偶遇了一个让真嗣颇为不悦的人。

A certain dark-haired athletic student and his nerdy accomplice, who was the first to speak as they all came to an awkward halt.
一位黑发且体格健壮的学生与他的书呆子伙伴，在众人尴尬停步时，这位伙伴率先打破了沉默。

"Hi guys. Doing some shopping?"
大家好，在买东西吗？

Asuka looked pointedly at the bags Shinji was carrying for several seconds, then at the place they had just left, before turning back to Kensuke. "So that's what that building's for!" she exclaimed in sarcastic innocence, to which Kensuke chuckled.
明日香目光锐利地盯着真嗣手里的袋子，凝视了几秒，随后又望向他们刚离开的地点，接着转头对健介说：“原来那栋楼是用来干这个的啊！”她带着一丝讽刺的纯真感叹道，健介不禁轻笑起来。

Shinji took the opportunity to put the bags down for a moment. "Hello Kensuke. And um... Suzuhara..."
真嗣抓住机会放下手中的袋子，开口道：“你好，健介。还有...铃原...”

Suzuhara gave him a curt nod before folding his arms and looking away. Noticing this, Kensuke roughly elbowed the taller boy. Suzuhara let out a grunt of irritation, turning an angry glare on his friend.
铃原简短地点了点头，随即双臂交叉，扭头不看。见状，剑介用力用肘部顶了顶高个子的男孩。铃原不悦地哼了一声，怒视着他的朋友。

"Don't make me go to your sister," Kensuke warned. As Suzuhara began to protest, he pointed a finger at the jock's face. "I'll do it."
别逼我去找你姐姐，"健介警告道。铃原刚要反驳，他便用手指着对方的脸，强调说："我真的会去。

Letting out a hiss of frustration, Suzuhara rubbed the back of his head before looking at Shinji.
铃原懊恼地嘶了一声，摸了摸后脑勺，随即望向真嗣。

"Ikari," he slowly began, his eyes darting around, unable to maintain eye contact for more than a second at a time. "I'm... sorry for hittin' ya."
Ikari，" 他缓缓说道，眼神飘忽不定，难以维持超过一秒的对视。"我... 为打了你而道歉。

"Gee, you sound real apologetic there," Asuka remarked, still sarcastic.
"哎呀，你这道歉的语气可真够诚恳的，" 明日香依旧带着讽刺的口吻说道。

"Can it, ya red demon!" Suzuhara snapped back. "This is hard enough without you stickin' yer nose in again!"
消停点吧，你这红魔！" 铃原怒斥道，"没有你再来搅局，这事儿已经够棘手的了！

Asuka exaggeratedly raised her hands in a surrendering gesture before taking a couple steps back.
明日香夸张地举起双手，做出投降状，随即向后退了几步。

"Anyway, Red told me about what happened during the first attack," Suzuhara continued. "How NERV dropped the ball 'n such. Y'know, I actually talked to my lil' sis after I heard the truth. You know what she said?"
不管怎样，Red 向我透露了首次袭击时的内情，"Suzuhara 接着说。"NERV 当时确实处理不当。你知道吗，得知真相后，我还特意和妹妹谈了谈。你想知道她怎么说的吗？

Too nervous to say anything, Shinji simply shook his head.
过于紧张而无法言语，真嗣只是默默地摇了摇头。

"She said that she could never blame the pilot. Apparently she could tell that you were havin' trouble. We were just in the wrong place at the wrong time." He stopped, then set his jaw and strode up to Shinji. "Ikari. I need you to punch me."
她表示永远不会责怪飞行员。显然她察觉到你遇到了困难。我们只是恰巧在不合适的时间出现在了不合适的地方。"他顿了顿，随后紧抿嘴唇，迈步向真嗣走去。"碇，我需要你给我一拳。

Backing away in surprise at the jock's sudden approach, Shinji found himself standing next to Asuka and the two of them shared a look of puzzlement.
被运动员的突然靠近吓了一跳，真嗣退后几步，发现自己站在了明日香身边，两人面面相觑，都感到困惑不解。

"C'mon!" Suzuhara nearly shouted. "If my own damn sister ain't gonna hold you responsible, then I've fucked up by hurting you! I gotta make this right!"
得了吧！" 铃原几乎喊出声。"连我亲妹妹都不追究你，我伤害了你，真是大错特错！我必须弥补这个过失！

"He's serious," Kensuke piped up. "If Toji tells you to hit him, he wants you to hit him."
他可是认真的，"健介插话道，"要是东二叫你打他，那他是真想让你动手。

Shinji wasn't so sure. The boy in front of him looked more like he was about to start swinging first. People nearby were beginning to give the teenagers a wide berth, perhaps sensing a fight. He didn't even want to hit Suzuhara, not even after the sucker punch he'd received the first time they'd met. Anyone had the right to exact revenge on someone like him, especially if it was due to an injured sibling. Even if that sibling knew it was an accident.
真嗣对此并不确定。站在他面前的男孩似乎随时准备先发制人。周围的人开始有意避开这两个青少年，或许是预感到一场冲突即将爆发。尽管初次见面时被铃原偷袭，真嗣却并不想还手。任何人面对铃原这样的人，尤其是在兄弟因意外受伤的情况下，都有理由寻求报复。即便那位兄弟明白那只是个意外。

A heavy hand on Shinji's shoulder drew him out of his self-loathing.
一只沉甸甸的手搭在真嗣肩上，把他从自我厌恶中拽了出来。

"Just get it over with, Shinji," said Asuka, before giving him a light shove forward.
"真嗣，赶紧结束吧，"明日香说完，轻轻推了他一下。

Shinji stumbled a little, giving Asuka a betrayed look over his shoulder, before gazing at Suzuhara.
真嗣脚步踉跄，回头向明日香投去一个受伤的眼神，随后目光转向铃原。

"Um... you're sure about this?"
呃...你真的确定要这么做吗？

Suzuhara gave only a nod, then raised his chin.
铃原仅微微颔首，随即昂首示意。

The punch wasn't anything spectacular; despite his training in an Evangelion, Shinji still didn't really know how to throw a punch properly. He simply put everything into a wild left hook that smacked into Suzuhara's jaw with a meaty thump, spinning the jock's head around.
那一拳平平无奇；尽管在福音战士中受过训练，真嗣仍未掌握出拳的诀窍。他全力挥出一记左勾拳，重重地打在铃原的下巴上，发出一声沉闷的撞击声，使得这位运动员的头猛地一扭。

Shinji then proceeded to cradle his left hand, which was now throbbing angrily at him.
随后，真嗣紧紧抱住那只正愤怒跳动的左手，似乎在责备他。

"Just as I expected, you went right for the face."
不出所料，你果然直接打脸了。

Asuka's sardonic comment caused him to turn around. She then walked up to him and grabbed his left wrist. After a little prodding, Shinji opened the fist his hand had clenched into in pain. Asuka examined his hand carefully, letting it drop half a minute later.
明日香的讥讽让真嗣转过身来。她随即上前，一把抓住他的左手腕。经过一番催促，真嗣才痛苦地张开了紧握的拳头。明日香仔细端详了他的手，半晌后才放手。

"Lucky," she said. "Your hand's going to hurt for a while, but you didn't break anything." She looked away. "Hey Stefan, how's your face?"
真幸运，"她说。"你的手会疼一阵子，但好在没伤到骨头。"她转开视线。"嘿，斯特凡，你脸没事吧？

Suzuhara was working his jaw side to side, rubbing his cheek at the same time. At Asuka's question, he looked at them and said, "'s fine. Might get a bruise, but I've been hit harder."
铃原正来回活动着下巴，边揉脸颊边回答明日香的问题：“没事，可能会有点淤青，不过我以前挨的打比这狠多了。”

Asuka nodded. "And we can now agree that nothing more needs to be said on this matter?"
明日香点头说：“我们对此事已无更多需要讨论的，可以达成共识了吧？”

"Yeah, yeah." 对，对。

After saying farewell, two of the teenagers doing it somewhat gruffly, Asuka, Shinji and Rei left the shopping centre and got on a bus to go back home. There were more odd looks, and Shinji caught people staring, but Rei seemed to have focused most of her attention on the bag in her hands, and the rest to looking out the window.
告别后，两位少年略带粗鲁地离去，明日香、真嗣和绫波离开购物中心，搭上公交车返家。车上不时有人投来异样目光，真嗣察觉到这些视线，而绫波则大部分时间专注于手中的袋子，偶尔望向窗外。

It might have been Shinji's imagination, but he thought he could see the faintest hint of a smile on her face.
或许是真嗣的错觉，但他隐约觉得她脸上似乎掠过了一抹极淡的微笑。

"Did you really have to drag me in right now?" Misato moaned as she entered Ritsuko's office. "I was hoping to get some more time to relax before having to fly out to this stupid Jet Alone thing."
你非得现在拉我进来吗？" 惱怒的碇真嗣走进赤木律子的办公室时嘟囔着。"我本想在飞去应付那个麻烦的 Jet Alone 项目之前，多享受一会儿悠闲时光。

"Science doesn't rest," Ritsuko retorted, her eyes not straying from the monitor in front of her.
"科学从不停歇，" 律子反驳道，双眼紧盯着面前的监视器。

"Science, or you?" 科学重要，还是你重要？

"Yes." 是的。

"Ugh. What's so science-y and important that you needed me here for?"
哎呀，到底是什么科学上的大事，非得让我来？

Ritsuko finally looked up. "It's something that concerns your charges." The corners of her mouth turned up a little. "We've finally cracked that anomaly in Asuka's AT-Field."
律子终于抬起头，嘴角微扬：“这事关乎你的被监护人。我们终于破解了明日香 AT 领域中的那个异常。”

"It's nothing bad, is it?" Misato worriedly asked.
"这不是什么坏事吧？" 碇真嗣有些担忧地问道。

Her smile widening microscopically, Ritsuko turned the monitor around so that Misato could see it too.
理佐子的笑容微不可察地加深，她将显示器转向美里，好让她也能看清楚。

"Uh, what am I looking at?" To Misato, the image on the screen looked like nothing more than a red sine wave.
"嗯，这是什么东西？" 在碇真嗣眼中，屏幕上呈现的图像仅是一条红色的正弦曲线。

The smile slackened, and the scientist sighed. "Sometimes I forget you're not as intellectually inclined as me. This is the waveform pattern of Asuka's AT-Field. Look closely, see if you can spot the issue."
笑容逐渐缓和，科学家轻叹一声。“我有时会忘记，你并不像我这样热衷于智力活动。这是明日香的 AT 力场波形图，你仔细瞧瞧，看能否找出问题。”

Misato dragged a chair over to the desk, and sat down to look closely. "Looks... wavey. Is this normal? What exactly am I supposed to spot?"
真嗣把椅子拉到桌旁，坐下来仔细端详。"看上去...有波纹。这正常吗？我该留意些什么呢？"

Ritsuko tapped a button, and the sine wave zoomed in. "Anything yet?"
律子轻按按钮，正弦波图随即放大。“有什么发现吗？”

"Nope." 不行。

Another tap, this time the sine wave began to move. "What about now?"
换了个水龙头，这回正弦波开始动了。“那现在呢？”

Misato leaned closer. "Nothin- wait... Zoom in again."
碇真嗣凑近了些。“没啥——等等...再放大看看。”

There seemed to be something flickering over the red sine wave. At her request, Ritsuko slowed it down by several orders of magnitude. Now she could see a blue sine wave replacing the red one every half-second.
红色正弦波上仿佛有东西在闪烁。根据她的请求，律子将波形放慢了数个数量级。如今，她能清晰地看到每半秒就有一个蓝色正弦波替换掉红色正弦波。

"Two waveforms, huh?" Misato said as she leaned back in her chair. "Gonna take a wild guess and say that the second one is Shinji's."
两个波形，对吧？" 美里说着，身体向后靠在椅子上。"我猜第二个是真嗣的。

"Correct. This is some of the data from when Unit-01 was first attacked by the Fifth Angel." Ritsuko turned the monitor back towards her before resting her chin in her hand. "The two AT-Fields worked in concert to reduce the damage Unit-01 sustained by rapidly alternating which one was in front."
没错。这些数据记录了初号机首次受到第五使徒攻击的情况。" 律子将显示屏转向自己，手托着下巴解释道，"两者的 AT 力场相互配合，通过迅速轮换在前的方式，大幅降低了初号机所承受的损伤。

Misato exhaled slowly. "You obviously have a lot of data from that encounter, so tell me something." She fixed her friend with a steely look. "What would have happened if Shinji had been able to use his AT-Field and got sent out there?"
真嗣缓缓地呼出一口气。“你显然从那次遭遇中掌握了大量数据，所以告诉我，”她目光坚定地盯着朋友，“如果真嗣能使用他的 AT 力场并被派出去，结果会怎样？”

Ritsuko stared at her for a few seconds before replying. "You shouldn't concern yourself with what-ifs, especially when the situation has already passed."
理子凝视了她片刻后才开口：“过去的事就别多想了，尤其是那些假设性的‘如果’。”

"Tell me." 说来听听。

Shaking her head, Ritsuko looked at her monitor as she shot a quick calculation request to the MAGI. A moment later, she had her reply. "In all likelihood, Shinji would not have been able to sustain his AT-Field. The feedback would have quickly rendered him unconscious, at which point the field would drop and Unit-01 would have been badly crippled or even destroyed, depending on our response time."
律子摇了摇头，盯着监视器，迅速向 MAGI 发出了一个计算请求。不久，她收到了回复。“真嗣很可能无法维持 AT 场。反馈会很快让他失去意识，那时 AT 场会消失，零号机将严重受损，甚至可能被摧毁，这取决于我们的反应速度。”

Misato was silent for a long time. Ritsuko evidently felt the need to fill the void. "Whatever has happened between Shinji and Asuka, it was a good thing here. Asuka only sustained minor, easily healed injuries and Unit-01 was able to be quickly repaired for the second attempt. The Angel is dead and your pilots are fine. Focus on that, Misato."
碇真嗣与明日香之间无论发生了什么，在这里都是好事。明日香仅受了些轻微且易愈的伤，零号机也迅速修复，准备迎接第二次挑战。使徒已被消灭，你的驾驶员们都安然无恙。葛城，请专注于这些。

"I suppose," Misato finally said after a long time spent staring at nothing. "Has this gotten you any closer to finding a way to let Shinji fight?"
我想，" Misato 在长时间凝视虚空后终于开口，"这让你更接近找到让 Shinji 参战的方法了吗？

"I'm afraid not," Ritsuko admitted. "This has just let us solve the issue of the anomaly. As yet I have no idea how we could... give Shinji his AT-Field back. I did suggest the idea I've been working on to Commander Ikari, but he vetoed it."
恐怕不行，" 律子坦言，"我们只是解决了异常问题。至于如何让真嗣恢复 AT 力场，我仍无计可施。我曾向碇司令提出我一直在研究的想法，但他并未采纳。

"Vetoed?" Misato raised an eyebrow. "Just what is this idea?"
被否决了？" 真嗣挑了挑眉。"这主意究竟是什么？

Ritsuko told her. Misato blinked several times, then said, "And you think it'll work?"
律子告诉了她。真嗣眨了眨眼，随后问道：“你觉得这办法行得通吗？”

"With the limitations we have, it's the only thing I can think of short of keeping Unit-01 in a rearguard position as a sniper or something. Even then, there's still a high risk of danger without an AT-Field."
考虑到我们的局限性，除了让初号机担任后卫狙击手之类的角色外，我实在想不出其他对策。即便这样，没有 AT 力场保护，危险依旧很大。

Tapping a finger against her chin in thought, Misato mused, "Well, it would let Shinji get out there and feel useful. If the Commander hadn't vetoed it, how long before you could produce something we can work with?"
Misato 用手指轻敲着下巴，若有所思地说：“这样能让 Shinji 出去做些事，感觉自己有用。要是指挥官没否决，你们多久能造出我们能用的东西？”

"A month at most," replied Ritsuko after a moment's consideration. "We'd need to do a lot of coding and debugging, not to mention tests. The hardware side would be the easy part, since we already essentially have what we need."
最多一个月，" Ritsuko 稍作思考后说，"我们得进行大量编码、调试，还有测试。硬件倒不是问题，毕竟我们所需的基本都有了。

"Well... keep me informed. You know; just in case he changes his mind."
嗯...随时告诉我情况。你知道的，万一他改变主意呢。

"Of course. By the way, speaking of Shinji... have you actually told him the real story of Second Impact yet?"
当然。对了，提到真嗣……你有没有跟他讲过第二次冲击的真相？

XXX

The day after Shinji's wardrobe was reluctantly improved, he was somewhat surprised by Misato's request to speak to him in private when he got home from school. Asuka was no help at finding out what their guardian wanted, and he didn't even bother asking Rei. So while the two girls were in his apartment doing homework, Shinji went next door to Misato's.
真嗣的衣橱勉强升级后的次日，放学回家时，美里突然提出要私下与他交谈，让他颇感意外。明日香对此一无所知，真嗣也未曾向绫波询问。于是，当两位女孩在真嗣的公寓里埋头做作业时，他独自前往隔壁美里的住处。

An hour later, he left in a daze. He ran a hand through his hair as he stepped into his apartment, going over the story again in his head. An expedition to the South Pole. An experiment on the... thing they had found there. A cataclysm.
一小时后，他恍惚地离开了。走进公寓时，他不由自主地用手捋了捋头发，脑海中再次回放起那个故事：一次南极探险，对那里发现的神秘物体进行的一项实验，以及随之而来的一场灾难。

Half of the world's population wiped out in the aftermath.
灾难过后，世界人口减半。

Since learning about the 'meteor impact' in Antarctica, Shinji had been a little sceptical about the story. Weren't scientists capable of tracking anything that came close to Earth? Wouldn't there have been more warning? Now he knew that that had all just been a cover-up, as well as why Tokyo-3 had been turned into a fortress that, so far, every Angel had attempted to breach.
自从得知南极洲的“陨石撞击”事件，真嗣对此一直心存疑虑。难道科学家追踪不了靠近地球的任何物体？难道不该有更多预警吗？如今他恍然大悟，那一切不过是掩盖真相的幌子，也明白了为何东京-3 被建成了坚不可摧的堡垒，至今每个使徒都试图攻破它。

Shinji was jolted out of his musing when somebody bumped into him. He mumbled an apology as he slowly walked towards the lounge room.
真嗣正沉浸在思绪中，突然被人撞了一下，这才惊醒过来。他低声说了句对不起，然后慢慢走向客厅。

"Hey Shinji, you alright?" came Asuka's voice.
"嘿，真嗣，你没事吧？" 明日香的声音传来。

"Huh?" He turned to face her, realising that he had been wandering in a daze. "Yeah, I guess so."
啊？" 他转向她，意识到自己刚才一直在发呆。"嗯，应该是吧。

"What did Misato talk to you about? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Misato 跟你谈了些什么？你看起来像是撞见了鬼似的。

"Second Impact," Shinji mumbled. "She told me what really happened."
‘第二次冲击’，真嗣低声说道，‘她告诉了我真相。’

"Oh. Huh, I thought you'd have been told by now. I was told not long after starting to learn how to pilot." Asuka shrugged and headed towards the door, where she slipped on her shoes.
"哦，我还以为你已经知道了。我是在开始学开飞机后不久得知的。" 明日香耸耸肩，走向门口，穿上鞋子。

"Where are you going?" Shinji asked.
"你去哪儿？" 真嗣问道。

"Some bigwig company's trying to create a 'replacement'-" Asuka made finger quotes around the word and rolled her eyes, "-for the Evas. Misato's been invited to the demonstration, and I guess I'm her plus-one."
某家大公司正试图推出一种所谓的'替代品'——" 飞鸟边说边用手指比划着引号，并翻了个白眼，"——来取代 EVA。美里受邀参加演示，而我则是她的陪同。

Shinji glanced at the lounge room. "What about Rei?"
真嗣朝客厅看了一眼，问道：“绫波在哪里？”

"You and I are remaining here on standby, in case of emergency," said Rei, without turning her head away from her homework.
"你我留在这里待命，以防万一，" Rei 说着，头也没抬，继续做她的作业。

"Oh, okay." 哦，行。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "What, not gonna complain about being stuck here? I know I would."
明日香挑眉道：“怎么，不打算抱怨一下被困在这儿吗？换我肯定会的。”

Shinji shrugged. "It's a giant robot, right? There's three of them right here already."
真嗣耸耸肩说：“这是巨型机器人吧？这里已经有三台了。”

"Yeah, but this one's different. Completely mechanical and remote controlled. Oh, and it's nuclear-powered."
没错，但这个与众不同。它完全机械化，由远程操控。而且，它采用的是核动力。

"What?!" That brought him up short. "How is that a good idea for something that'll be fighting Angels?!"
什么？！" 这话让他猛地一愣。"这怎么能算是对抗天使的好办法呢？！

Asuka chuckled at his reaction. "That's been the reaction of a lot of people. But this company believes they can make it work. I'm just going because I want to see the project fall flat on its face."
明日香看到他的反应，不禁轻笑。"不少人都有这样的反应。不过，这家公司坚信自己能成功。我纯粹是想去亲眼见证这个项目如何出丑。"

"Just..." Shinji took a step closer to her. "Just be careful, alright? If something goes wrong..."
只是...” 碇真嗣向她走近了一步。“千万要小心，好吗？万一出了差错...

"I'm sure it'll be fine," Asuka replied, giving him a reassuring smile. "It'll fall over or stop responding, or intelligent people will realise it's too dangerous, we'll all laugh at how dumb it is and how moronic its creators are, then go home." She looked up at the clock. "I'd better get going, Misato should be ready soon."
我敢肯定一切都会没事的，" 明日香回应着，给了他一个安心的微笑。"它要么会倒下，要么会停止运作，或者聪明人会意识到它太危险了，我们都会嘲笑它的愚蠢和其创造者的愚昧，然后各自回家。" 她抬头望了望时钟。"我得赶紧走了，美里应该快准备好了。

She left with a farewell wave over her shoulder. The door slid shut, and Shinji eventually stumbled into the lounge room. He still needed to finish his homework, but now he had two crazy things to think about.
她挥手告别，转身离去。门轻轻关上，不久，真嗣踉跄地走进客厅。他本应完成作业，此刻脑海中却盘旋着两件令人心烦意乱的事。

He sat down and stared at the homework. Rei had apparently already finished, judging by the fact that she was reading in a chair. Since he didn't want to disturb her, Shinji resolved to suffer in silence.
他坐下后，目光落在作业上。看来绫波已经做完了，正坐在椅子上阅读。为了避免打扰她，真嗣决定默默承受。

XXX

Hours passed, and Shinji only managed to get a few problems done. Just as he was putting pen to paper for another attempt at the current one, he heard the apartment door open. The pen was practically thrown from his hand as he got up and almost ran to the door.
时间一分一秒地过去，真嗣勉强完成了几个问题。就在他再次提笔试图攻克眼前难题时，公寓的门突然开了。他慌忙丢下笔，几乎是跑着冲向门口。

Asuka and Misato were there, both looking tired and worn out.
明日香和美里都在场，两人显得疲惫而憔悴。

"Um, hello," he said. "How... did everything go?"
呃，你好，"他问道，"事情进展得怎么样了？

"Well, I was sort of right," Asuka tiredly replied, staggering to the dining table and sitting down. "It did fail. Nothing to laugh about though."
唉，我猜得没错，" 明日香疲惫地回应，步履蹒跚地来到餐桌前坐下。"确实没成功，但也没什么可笑的。

Shinji moved to the kitchen and began preparing dinner. "Why? What happened?"
真嗣走进厨房，开始准备晚餐。"怎么了？出什么事了？"

"Damn thing went out of control," Misato snarled, sitting across from Asuka. "Started walking towards the city while it was overloading. We had to get Unit-01 flown out so Asuka could stop it."
那玩意儿失控了，" 葛城美里怒气冲冲地坐在明日香对面。"它一边超载一边朝城市走去。我们只好把初号机空运出去，让明日香去阻止。

"Hey, all I did was keep it still," said Asuka. "You're the mad woman who climbed inside to shut it down."
嘿，我不过是在保持它不动，" 阿苏卡说道，"你才是那个疯了似的爬进去关掉它的女人。

Shinji almost dropped the knife he'd just pulled out of its block. "Wait what?!" He spun around to face them. "You went inside a nuclear-powered robot that was about to blow up?!"
真嗣差点没拿稳刚从刀架上抽出的刀。"等等，你说什么?!" 他急忙转身面对他们。"你们居然进了一个快要爆炸的核动力机器人里面?!"

"Somebody had to shut it down," Misato retorted, throwing her arms up before slapping them onto the table in anger. "And the people who were supposed to be controlling it had no chance! Besides, I was in a radiation suit."
必须有人来关闭它，" 碇真嗣反驳道，举起双手，随后愤怒地拍在桌上。"那些负责控制的人根本无能为力！况且，我当时穿着防辐射服。

"That's not the point!" Shinji exclaimed. "It could have exploded! You might have died!"
问题不在这！" 真嗣急切地说。"它差点就爆炸了！你差点就没命了！

"I don't think I was ever in any real danger, Shinji." Misato leaned back in her chair. "I can't say much, but I'm pretty sure it shut down by itself before I managed to do it."
我觉得自己从未真正陷入危险，真嗣。" 美里向后靠在椅子上。"虽然不能透露太多，但我敢肯定，在我动手之前，它已经自行停止了。

Letting out a breath, Shinji turned around and tried to busy himself with dinner again.
真嗣深吸一口气，转过身来，再次尝试专注于准备晚餐。

"Hey." 你好。

He glanced over his shoulder. Misato was twisted around in her seat to face him. She gave him a warm smile.
他回头一瞥，只见碇真嗣在座位上扭过身来，正对着他，脸上挂着温暖的笑容。

"I appreciate the concern, but I'm not going anywhere for a long time." She reached up and patted him on the shoulder. "Okay?"
我非常感谢你的关心，不过我会在这里待很长时间。" 她伸手轻拍他的肩膀，"这样行吗？

"...Okay," he replied, returning her smile with a shy one of his own.
"...好的，"他回答着，脸上露出了一丝羞涩的微笑，回应着她的笑容。

"Great. Now then, how long on dinner? I'm starving!"
太好了。对了，晚餐还要等多久？我饿得不行了！

"Me too!" Asuka chimed in. "Hurry up!"
我也一样！" 明日香急忙附和。"快点儿！

Sighing good-naturedly, Shinji hastened to provide them with sustenance.
新二和蔼地叹了口气，赶忙为他们提供食物。

### Chapter 12 Over The Rainbow

Shinji was out on the balcony of his and Asuka's apartment, relaxing in one of the outdoor chairs with his SDAT and enjoying the rare cool evening breeze after finishing his homework. There was a warbling squawk from the next balcony over. With the way the apartment building had been designed, there was a slanted wall partitioning off the balconies from each other, presumably for privacy. Shinji removed his earphones, but without even needing to try and look around the partition, he knew it was Pen-pen. From several weeks of experience, he knew that that squawk had meant, essentially, 'get me another beer!'
真嗣在他与明日香共住的公寓阳台上，悠闲地坐在户外椅中，听着 SDAT，享受着做完作业后难得的凉爽晚风。隔壁阳台传来一阵颤音般的叫声。公寓楼的设计使得阳台间有一堵斜墙相隔，想必是为了保护隐私。真嗣摘下耳机，无需探头查看隔墙另一侧，便知是企鹅在叫。几周的相处让他明白，那叫声是在说：“再给我拿瓶啤酒来！”

Then again, the can shake each time certainly helped with the translation.
同样，每次摇动罐子确实对翻译有所帮助。

Shinji was mildly surprised to hear Asuka responding to the call, practically slamming the balcony door open and sighing upon seeing Pen-pen's request. A moment later she returned and said, "Here's your beer, you lazy little duck."
真嗣略感意外，听到明日香应声而起，几乎是用力的推开阳台门，瞥见企鹅的请求后不禁叹息。不久，她折返并说道：“这是你的啤酒，你这懒小鸭。”

"Wark." 发出鸣叫声。

"You're welcome," Asuka grunted.
"不客气，" 明日香嘟囔着说。

After about a minute of silence, Shinji put his earphones back in, and began to settle back into-
经过大约一分钟的沉默，真嗣再次戴上耳机，逐渐恢复了平静

"Oh, this is where you've been hiding."
哦，原来你一直藏在这儿啊。

"What?!" Shinji yelped and almost leapt back out of the chair. He looked around for Asuka, before quickly adding, "I wasn't hiding!"
什么?!" 真嗣惊呼一声，差点从椅子上蹦起来。他环顾四周寻找明日香，随即急忙澄清："我可没在躲！

Surprisingly, Asuka wasn't at their balcony door. Instead, she was...
出乎意料，明日香并未站在他们的阳台门前，而是...

Climbing over the partitioning wall. Just like Misato had warned them not to attempt.
翻过分隔墙，正如美里之前警告他们不要去尝试的那样。

"Asuka! What are you doing?!"
阿苏卡！你在干什么呢？

"Taking a shortcut, genius," Asuka retorted, pausing to adjust her grip. "I don't feel like going back through Misato's stuffy-as-hell apartment when it's so nice out here."
走捷径，真聪明，" 明日香反驳着，停下脚步调整了握姿。"外面这么宜人，我才不想再穿过美里那闷得要命的公寓。

"Are you sure that's a good id-"
你确定那个 id 合适吗？

If Asuka had been wearing proper footwear, she would have had no problems in her trek. Instead, her sandalled foot slipped off of the wall the moment it touched down on Shinji's side. She fell quickly, stopped only by an outstretched hand grabbing desperately onto the edge of the balcony.
倘若明日香穿的是合适的鞋履，她在徒步中便不会遭遇任何困难。然而，她穿着凉鞋的脚刚一触到真嗣这边的墙面，便滑脱了。她急速下坠，幸得一只手拼命抓住阳台边缘，才得以止住跌势。

"Asuka!" Shinji cried out as he rushed to help, panic quickly beginning to flood his body.
"Asuka!" 真嗣惊呼一声，急忙跑去援助，恐慌感迅速蔓延至全身。

"I'm fine, just pull me up!" Asuka shouted back, waving her free hand in the air above her head.
"我没事，快拉我上去！" 明日香大声喊道，挥舞着她那只空闲的手在头顶上方。

With both hands, Shinji latched onto the flailing limb. But when Asuka let go of the balcony to transfer both hands to his, he suddenly found himself with a problem. Namely, that he just wasn't strong enough to carry Asuka's weight like this. His stomach collided with the balcony wall and he tipped forward, just barely managing to keep his feet on the ground.
真嗣双手紧握着挥舞的肢体。然而，当明日香松开阳台，将双手移至他手上时，他猛然意识到自己力不从心，难以支撑她的重量。腹部撞击阳台墙，身体前倾，他竭力稳住双脚，不让自己倒下。

"Are you kidding me?!" 你是在开玩笑吗?!

"Ngh! Sorry!" Shinji managed to say through gritted teeth. His face was scrunched up from the effort; even his eyes were closed.
"嗯！抱歉！" 真嗣紧咬牙关，艰难地挤出这句话。他的脸因用力而扭曲，双眼紧闭。

"Told you you were too damn skinny!" There was a pause. "Look, just drop me."
早就跟你说过，你太瘦了！"稍作停顿后，"行了，让我下车吧。

"What?!" That got him to open his eyes. "Are you crazy?!"
什么？！" 这句话让他睁大了眼睛。"你疯了吗？！

"The next balcony is like five feet below me. I'll barely even feel the drop."
下一个阳台仅在五英尺之下，我几乎感觉不到下降的高度。

"Are... are you sure?" It wasn't like he could even do much if she wasn't.
"你真的确定吗？" 如果她不肯定，他其实也无能为力。

"Yes I am. Now drop me before your attempted heroism rewards you with two dislocated arms!"
没错，我确实在这里。赶紧把我放下，否则你逞英雄的结果可能是双臂脱臼！

With some reluctance, Shinji loosened his sweaty grip on Asuka's hands, gasping in relief as the weight left his arms. After a second or two of panting, he looked down.
带着几分不舍，真嗣松开了紧握着明日香汗湿双手的力道，随着手臂上的重量减轻，他如释重负地喘息着。稍作喘息后，他低头望去。

Asuka was standing right below, staring disappointedly up at him.
明日香站在正下方，抬头失望地凝视着他。

"Told you," she said. "But I'll let you say 'I told you so' about the shortcut."
我早就提醒过你了，" 她说。"不过这次让你说 '我早就说过' 关于那条捷径的事。

Relief washed through Shinji, and he watched as Asuka disappeared from sight, presumably to try the balcony door.
释然之情涌上心头，真嗣目送着明日香消失在视野里，她应该是去试着开阳台门了。

"Huh." 哦。

"What is it?" he called down upon hearing the confusion in Asuka's voice.
"怎么了？"他听到明日香声音中的慌乱，便大声问道。

"The door's unlocked. Pretty damn sloppy for Section Two, but at least I should be able to get back up there in a minute."
门竟然没锁，第二部门也太不小心了，不过至少我应该很快就能返回上面。

In fact it only took about thirty seconds for her to be standing in their kitchen, where she at least had the decency to look a little ashamed.
实际上，她仅用了大约三十秒便站在了他们的厨房中，至少她还显得有些羞愧。

"Just don't tell Misato about this," she said after a few seconds of Shinji staring at her. She looked away and rubbed the back of her head. "And... um... thanks for trying to rescue me."
这事就别让美里知道了，"她避开真嗣的目光，几秒后说道。她转过头，揉了揉后脑勺。"还有...嗯...谢谢你救我。

"I did say I'd help you if you needed it," Shinji replied, recalling the conversation they had had a while ago about him running to her aid. He shrugged, wincing at what the movement did to his strained limbs. "But... I guess I'm not going to be very good at it..."
我确实说过，如果你需要，我会伸出援手，" 真嗣回忆起之前他们关于他赶来帮忙的谈话，回答道。他耸了耸肩，因牵动到疲惫的四肢而微微皱眉。"不过... 恐怕我帮不了太多...

Asuka whirled around and poked him in the chest. "You need to bulk up a bit. Your limited diet has obviously stunted your physique. Start eating properly and get some goddamn exercise." She backed off a little and folded her arms. "Ask that Suzuhara boy; maybe he can help."
明日香猛地转身，手指戳了戳他的胸膛，“你得增增肌了。你那单调的饮食明显影响了你的体态。得开始合理饮食，多做些运动。”她稍稍后退，双臂抱胸，“去问问那个叫铃原的男生，说不定他能帮到你。”

Shinji opened his mouth, but shut it again upon seeing the warning look directed at him by Asuka, who had clearly predicted what he was about to say.
真嗣刚要开口，却因明日香那警告的眼神而闭上了嘴，显然她已经猜到他即将说出口的话。

"Everything that's happened between you two is in the past, so leave it there. His own damn sister, the actual victim in all this, doesn't blame you. If you keep this up, I'll do everything I can to find out where she is, just so I can drag you in front of her and have her tell you face to face."
你们之间的一切都已成往事，就让它过去吧。他亲妹妹，真正的受害者，都没有责怪你。如果你执意如此，我会竭尽全力找到她，只为让你站在她面前，听她亲口说。

"Alright, alright," Shinji relented, putting his hands up in surrender despite the pain in his shoulders.
"行了，行了，" 真嗣无奈地举起双手，尽管肩膀传来阵阵痛楚。

XXX

Things were understandably a little tense between Shinji Ikari and Toji Suzuhara for a few days after their last confrontation. It seemed that neither of them were sure of how to act towards the other whenever they bumped into each other. The two of them would usually end up awkwardly silent until somebody else started talking. This made it difficult for Shinji to bring up the topic of exercise, no matter how much Asuka pointedly stared at him.
在上次冲突后，真嗣·碇与东治·铃原之间难免有些紧张。两人相遇时，彼此都不知如何是好，往往陷入尴尬的沉默，直到旁人打破僵局。这让真嗣难以启齿谈论锻炼的事，尽管明日香总是有意无意地向他投来目光。

In the end, Hikari was the one to get the ball rolling, and Shinji would lay odds that Asuka had asked the class representative to help out. Whatever the reason, he now found himself sitting at a table in the cafeteria across from Suzuhara. Asuka and Rei were sitting on opposite sides of him, and Kensuke and Hikari were next to Suzuhara, but it felt like the two of them were in a void.
最终，是光率先推动了事情的发展，真嗣猜测这背后定有明日香请班长帮忙的影子。不论原因为何，他此刻坐在食堂的桌前，对面是铃原。明日香和零分别坐在他两侧，健介和光则坐在铃原旁边，然而他们俩似乎被隔绝在另一个空间。

"Right," Suzuhara finally said. "First off, just call me Toji. That formal crap annoys me."
嗯，" 铃原最后说，"首先，叫我冬二就行。那种拘谨的叫法我不喜欢。

"Um, okay," Shinji hesitantly replied.
"嗯，好吧，" 真嗣迟疑地回答道。

"Good." Toji thrust his hand out. Shinji stared at it for a moment, hovering over the table between them, before realising that the jock wanted him to shake it. He did so, and Toji grinned at him.
"好的。" 东治伸出手来。真嗣愣了一下，目光停留在两人之间的桌面上，这才明白对方是要握手。他伸手相握，东治随即露出了笑容。

"Okay, so you're a skinny guy lookin' to get fit, right?"
好的，看来你是个偏瘦的人，想要健身增肌，对吗？

Asuka suddenly piped up. "He almost wrecked both his arms trying to lift m-... something the other day."
明日香突然开口说：“他前两天为了举起某个东西，差点把双臂都弄伤了。”

Toji chuckled. "Yeah, I could see that happenin'. You're like a twig, man."
透二笑着说：“确实，我能想象得到。你真是瘦得跟小树枝似的，兄弟。”
Shinji directed an impotent glare at the two conspirators. "C-can we just get to the point?!"
真嗣无力地瞪了两个共谋者一眼，急切地说："我们能不能直接说重点？"

"Yeah, sure," said Toji. "First things first, you're gonna need to start small. No way somebody like you would be able to jump right to liftin' weights. Chances are you've got no stamina, so start there." He pointed towards a window. "Couple days a week, go for a walk when you got nothin' better to do. Doesn't matter where you go, as long as you're movin'. Got it?"
当然，"托吉说道，"首先，你得从基础做起。像你这样，直接举重肯定不行。估计你耐力也不足，先从这里入手吧。"他指了指窗户，"每周抽几天，闲着也是闲着，出去走走。走哪儿无所谓，关键是要动起来。懂了吗？

At a nod from Shinji, Toji continued. "Don't go overboard though, tryin' to compensate for how bad off you might be. If you do too much too soon, you'll start feelin' tired and defeated." With a conspiratorial wink, he tapped the side of his head. "And then you start wonderin' if you should bother anymore. Next thing ya know, you're right back where you started."
在真嗣的点头示意下，东治接着说：“不过，也别太勉强自己，试图一下子弥补自己的不足。要是操之过急，很快就会感到力不从心，心生挫败。”他眨了眨眼，轻敲自己的太阳穴，“接着你就会开始怀疑，这一切是否还值得。不知不觉中，你又回到了原点。”

Shinji nodded again, then said, "Well I already walk to and from school every day, but that's only fifteen minutes or so. It isn't much distance-" He had to stop as Toji waved a hand in front of his face.
真嗣再次点头，接着说道：“我每天都是步行去学校再回来，大概十五分钟的路程。其实并不算远——”他话未说完，东治便在他面前摆了摆手，示意他停下。

"None of that negative crap," the jock barked. "The fact that you're already doin' something is good. Doesn't matter that it's only fifteen minutes. That's at least... two hours of exercise a week already. Besides, there's also P.E. class. That's even more exercise time."
别提那些消极的废话，"运动员大声说道。"你已经在行动了，这就很好。虽然只是十五分钟，但至少相当于每周两小时的锻炼。别忘了，还有体育课，那也是额外的锻炼时间。

"He's got a point," Hikari interjected. "Exercise is as much mental as it is physical."
光插话说：'他说的没错，锻炼既是身体活动，也关乎精神层面。'

"Yeah. You should get some one-kilo weights too; that'll help more than you think."
对，你还得添置一些一公斤重的哑铃，它们带来的帮助会超出你的预期。

For the rest of lunch, Shinji was practically barraged with advice as the other teenagers joined in. Rei also offered one or two useful tidbits. When the bell rang, Shinji headed back to class feeling strangely tired.
午餐余下的时间，真嗣几乎被其他青少年的建议轰炸，连零也插入了几句有用的提示。铃声一响，真嗣便带着莫名的疲惫返回了教室。

"You gonna be able to remember all that?" Asuka asked as they left the cafeteria.
"你记得住这么多吗？" 飞鸟边离开食堂边问道。

"I hope so," he mumbled. "I'm just... kind of surprised how helpful you're all being."
希望如此，"他低声道。"我只是...对你们如此热心帮助感到有些意外。

Asuka groaned and directed a despairing look at the ceiling. "Come the hell on, Ikari. It's not like we hate you or anything. You're trying to better yourself, and we're helping you do it. What's wrong with that?"
明日香叹息着，绝望地抬头望向天花板。“喂，碇，我们并不是对你有意见。你正在努力变得更好，我们也在协助你。这有什么不妥吗？”

"Er... noth-" 呃... 没什么-

"Nothing. Exactly." 什么也没有。确实如此。

There was blessed quiet for a moment, before Asuka abruptly began giggling.
片刻的宁静之后，明日香突然忍不住笑出声来。

"What's so funny?" 有什么这么好笑的？

Asuka got herself under control, although there was still a smile on her face as she said, "I was just wondering if we should buy a leash."
明日香虽然脸上还挂着微笑，但已经恢复了平静，她提议道：“我在想，我们是不是该买条牵引绳呢？”

Shinji faltered, and somebody bumped into him from behind with a mumbled apology. "A leash? What for?"
真嗣脚步一乱，被人从后面撞了个正着，那人低声道了歉。"要牵绳吗？有什么用？"

"For Pen-pen. I was just imagining what it would look like if you took him for a walk."
关于 Pen-pen。我刚刚在想，如果你带他去散步，那场景会是什么样的。

Shinji blinked several times, then chuckled. "I think that'd raise quite a few eyebrows. Besides, Pen-pen's more of a housemate than a pet."
真嗣眨了眨眼，随后轻声笑道：“那样做肯定会让人惊讶。不过，企鹅与其说是宠物，不如说是同居者。”

Asuka shrugged, conceding the point. "Perhaps, but he's getting pretty pudgy. All that beer and lazing around… I wonder what the normal weight for a penguin is. Bet he'd be considered obese by comparison."
明日香耸耸肩，表示认同。“可能吧，但他确实胖了不少。成天啤酒不离手，懒散度日……企鹅的标准体重是多少呢？我猜和他一比，肯定算得上肥胖了。”

"Just... don't say that to his face, please?"
只是...请不要当着他的面说，拜托了？

"What, you don't want to see what an irate penguin looks like?"
怎么，你难道不想见识一下愤怒的企鹅是什么模样吗？

"No."

"Spoilsport." 煞风景的家伙。

XXX

A couple of days later, Asuka and Rei were called into NERV. Shinji tagged along purely because he had nothing better to do, and if anybody had something to say about his presence that day, he never heard any of it.
几天后，明日香和绫波被叫到了 NERV。真嗣只是因为闲着没事才跟了过去，至于那天是否有人对他的出现表示不满，他并未有所耳闻。

In a sense, it ended up being a good thing that he was there, considering what he ended up doing.
某种程度上，他在场反倒成了好事，毕竟他后来所做的贡献不容忽视。

A mock evacuation drill was declared in the city, ostensibly to test some new system. The buildings topside were retracted, and two giant biomechanical machines were deployed to the surface.
城市宣称进行了一次模拟疏散演练，旨在测试新系统。地面建筑的顶部被收起，两台庞大的生物机械装置随即部署至地表。

In Unit-01, Shinji readied himself for the task ahead. It had been no real surprise when the mission was announced, that of moving the remains of Ramiel out of the city. What did come as a surprise was when Asuka asked if she could give Shinji her spot in Unit-01, since it was a non-combat role and therefore he would be safe. It didn't take long for the people in charge to agree, but they insisted on Asuka 'riding shotgun' in the entry plug with him in case of emergency.
在零号机内，真嗣为即将执行的任务做好了准备。任务内容是将雷米尔的残骸移出城市，这消息并未引起太大波澜。然而，明日香提出将自己的位置让给真嗣，因为此次任务非战斗性质，他可以免于危险。负责人很快批准了这一提议，但要求明日香在紧急情况下与真嗣一同进入插入栓，以备不时之需。

Of course, nothing actually happened as Shinji and Rei worked together in their Evangelions to shift the massive blue diamond to its new location. The corpse was obscenely heavy though, even with the assistance of several super heavy duty transport helicopters doing their best to lighten the load. It ended up taking half an hour to move, and according to Doctor Akagi, the entire operation, expensive as it had been, was still far less than it would have cost to demolish it where it stood. Whatever crystalline substance Ramiel had been made of, it had been very strong. Firing a Pallet Rifle's entire magazine at it would have merely done the equivalent of stripping off a single layer of paint.
当然，实际上一切顺利，真嗣和绫波驾驶着他们的福音战士，合力将那颗巨大的蓝钻移至新地点。尽管有数架超重型运输直升机全力协助，那具遗骸依旧沉重得惊人。整个搬运过程耗时半小时，据赤木博士透露，尽管此次行动成本高昂，但仍远低于原地拆除所需费用。雷天使所构成的晶体物质异常坚固，即便用调色板步枪的全部弹药射击，也仅能剥去其表面一层薄薄的“油漆”。

The diamond came to rest near the spot where Asuka had dropped Shamshel after that battle. The corpse of the Fourth Angel had long since been cut up and disposed of, presumably shared out to the various research groups lucky enough to be vetted by NERV. It would be interesting to see what they could do with a giant blue diamond.
钻石最终落在了阿苏卡战后丢弃夏姆榭尔的地点附近。第四使徒的遗骸早已被分割并妥善处理，很可能已被分发给那些得到 NERV 认可的研究团队。他们将如何利用这块巨型蓝钻，着实令人好奇。

Shinji went home that day tired but happy to have contributed in some meaningful way. Doctor Akagi asked Rei to stay behind for some reason but, seeing as Rei didn't so much as blink before agreeing, it probably wasn't anything important.
那天，真嗣带着疲惫却满足的心情回家，因为他以某种有意义的方式贡献了自己的力量。赤木博士让绫波留下来，似乎有什么事，但绫波毫不迟疑地答应了，看来应该不是什么大事。

XXX

Asuka groaned. Shinji, hearing the noise, turned and saw her covering her face with her hands. If he was perfectly honest, he had something of a similar reaction too.
明日香发出了一声呻吟。真嗣听到后转过身，只见她双手捂脸。说实话，他自己也差点有同样的反应。

Because Kensuke just wouldn't shut up.
因为健介一直说个不停。

"Oh man, a MiG 55D!"
哇，一架米格-55D！

Shinji immediately tuned Kensuke out as he went on about whatever the helicopter was capable of. Maybe it had been a bad idea to let him and Toji tag along for this trip, but once he'd heard about where Shinji and Asuka were going, the military nerd had begged and pleaded with Misato to be allowed to join them. She had simply laughed at his enthusiasm before giving her approval.
真嗣对健介滔滔不绝地谈论直升机性能的话题置若罔闻。或许让健介和东治同行本就是个馊主意，但一听说真嗣和明日香的目的地，这位军事迷便缠着美里，苦苦哀求能一同前往。美里对他的热忱不过一笑置之，最终还是答应了。

Later, Misato had told Shinji and Asuka that she was mainly allowing the two boys to come along to cover the fact that this was official NERV business. With two teenage civilians, it would be more likely to be seen as simply a joyride. One look at the large cargo transport helicopter they were flying in, however, would likely ruin that cover story.
之后，美里向真嗣和明日香透露，她之所以让这两个男孩同行，主要是为了掩饰这是 NERV 的官方任务。有了两个未成年平民在场，这看起来更像是一次普通的兜风。不过，他们所乘坐的大型货运直升机，一眼就能揭穿这个伪装。

And now Kensuke seemed to be practically wetting himself at the opportunity to ride in one of NERV's heavy transport helicopters. The crewmen bustling around the helicopter, after a nod from Captain Katsuragi, didn't seem to mind the attention as some of them answered the excitable boy's questions. Although they did have to refuse to answer what was in the boxy cargo hold underneath the helicopter.
此刻，健介似乎因能乘坐 NERV 的重型运输直升机而激动得几乎失禁。得到葛城上尉的默许后，忙碌于直升机旁的机组人员对这股热情并不反感，甚至有人回应了男孩的连珠炮般的问题。然而，对于直升机下方方形货舱内的秘密，他们却守口如瓶。

"You know, Asuka," Shinji began, once Asuka stopped covering her face. "It is a helicopter. If Kensuke gets to be too much you could threaten to kick him out the door."
你知道吗，明日香，" 真嗣在明日香放下手后说，"这是直升机。如果健介太烦人，你可以吓唬他说要把他扔出去。

Asuka's expression changed, shifting to a thoughtful smile. She turned to him and replied, "You know me so well. I was just thinking that."
明日香的表情转为沉思的微笑，她转向他说：“你真是懂我。我刚才正想到这一点。”

"I'm used to it by this point," muttered Toji from behind the two of them. "I gotta deal with his crap more than you do. Just gimme the word and I'll give Ken a kick in the ass to shut him up."
到这会儿我已经习惯了，"Toji 在他们身后低声说道，"我处理他的烂摊子比你们都多。只要发个话，我就给 Ken 屁股上来一脚，让他消停。

Nearby, Misato turned from where she had been talking to somebody and began heading over.
不远处，刚刚还在与人交谈的碇真嗣转过身，开始朝这边走来。

"Alright, pile on in, kids," she said. "We'll be taking off in a few minutes."
好了，孩子们，快进来吧，"她说。"我们几分钟后就出发。

The three teenagers moved towards the helicopter, Toji reaching a hand out to drag Kensuke along as he passed. The jock stopped to let Misato step up and into the helicopter first, who gave him what Shinji thought was a rather flirtatious smile as she took a seat. Asuka was next, then Shinji right afterwards, both sitting on the same bench seat as Misato and the two civilian teenagers entered last, sitting across from the others. A crewman shut the door behind them then ran off as the helicopter pilots started up the engine.
三名少年走向直升机，Toji 伸手拉着 Kensuke 同行。那位运动员停下脚步，让 Misato 先行登机，她坐下时对运动员露出了 Shinji 觉得颇为挑逗的笑容。Asuka 紧随其后，接着是 Shinji，两人与 Misato 同坐一条长凳。两名平民少年最后登机，坐在对面。一名机组人员在他们身后关上门，随即跑开，直升机驾驶员随即启动引擎。

Kensuke was already bouncing in his seat as the helicopter left the ground, a small video camera glued to his eye as he panned it around the interior. But at least he'd quieted down.
直升机刚一离地，健介就兴奋得在座位上蹦跳，手里的小型摄像机紧贴着眼睛，四处拍摄机舱内部。还好，他总算安静了些。

"So... Asuka," said Shinji after a few minutes of blessed quiet. "Looking forward to seeing your Eva after so long away from it?"
那么... 明日香，" 真嗣在片刻的宁静后开口，"离开这么久，再次见到你的 Eva，感觉如何？

Asuka turned a patronising look upon him before smoothing out a non-existent wrinkle in the yellow dress she was wearing. "Gee. I wonder what the answer could possibly be to that question."
明日香带着一副居高临下的神情瞥了他一眼，接着抚平了身上黄色裙子上假想的皱褶。"哎，真想知道这个问题的答案到底是什么。"

Shinji blinked, realising just how obvious the answer really was, then chuckled ruefully. "You're going to say something about having been stuck in an obsolete model aren't you?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，恍然大悟答案竟如此明显，不禁苦笑道：“你肯定要说我之前用的是个老古董型号，对吧？”

"Weeellll..." The redhead exaggeratedly shrugged as best as she could without her arms bumping into Misato or Shinji. "Unit-01 does have three kills, so I guess I'll say instead that it's battle-proven. It didn't hold up too badly. You know, for a Test-Type."
哎呀……"红发女子夸张地耸了耸肩，小心翼翼地避免手臂碰到美里或真嗣。"零号机确实已经击杀了三次，所以我想说，它算是经过实战考验的。作为试验机型，表现还算不错。

"Speaking of which, I wonder if Rei will get transferred to Unit-01 when we get back," Shinji mused. "Unit-00's supposed to just be a prototype after all." He glanced somewhat expectantly at Misato, who noticed his expression and shrugged.
"提到这个，我在想我们回去后，绫是否会转到初号机去。毕竟零号机只是个原型机。" 真嗣若有所思地说。他略带期待地看了看美里，美里注意到他的表情，只是耸了耸肩。

"Sorry, I don't have an answer for you," she said. "I haven't been told anything about what's going to happen with the Eva assignments."
抱歉，我无法给您答案，"她表示。"关于伊娃任务将如何进行，我尚未接到任何指示。

"I reckon they'll stay the same," Kensuke piped up, camera still held to his eye as he focused on them. "If someone's been the driver of a main battle tank for ages, it doesn't make much sense to suddenly stick them in an MLRS."
我猜他们会维持现状，" 肯介插话道，相机依旧紧贴着眼，他正专注地对准他们。"如果一个人长期担任主战坦克的驾驶员，突然让他去操作多管火箭炮，这并不合理。

Shinji blinked owlishly at Kensuke, and Asuka gave him a cool look before turning back to Misato and asking, "How long is this flight?"
真嗣眨巴着眼睛，好奇地望向健介，而明日香则冷冷地扫了他一眼，随即转向美里询问：“这趟飞行需要多长时间？”

"About twenty more minutes."
再过二十分钟左右。

With a hollow thud, the back of Asuka's head met the bulkhead of the helicopter behind the seat.
随着一声沉闷的撞击，明日香的后脑勺猛地撞上了座位后方的直升机舱壁。

XXX

"Whoah, look at that carrier battle group down there!"
哇，快看下面那个航母战斗群！

Shinji could swear he heard Asuka's teeth grind a little.
真嗣确信自己听到了明日香牙齿轻轻摩擦的声音。

"We're not blind, you nerd!" she ground out.
"我们又不瞎，你这个书呆子！" 她不悦地说道。

"Several American aircraft carriers... oooh, there's a Russian heavy missile cruiser too! And Russia's only aircraft carrier!" Kensuke continued, oblivious to the glare directed at the back of his head as he stared out the side window. "Two... three... four battleships, and all those frigates and destroyers! If I didn't know better I'd think I was looking at an invasion fleet! … And... there's a ship with a massive sheet on it." 

"That'll be the transport ship Othello," Misato supplied. "Can't exactly fit an Eva on any military vessel."
那应该是运输舰奥赛罗号，" 碇真嗣补充说。"军舰上可装不下 Eva。

"Could you sit it on one of them aircraft carriers?" Toji wondered. "They look big enough to support a giant robot."
你能把它安置在某艘航空母舰上吗？" 东治思索着，"这些航母看起来足够宽敞，足以容纳一个巨型机器人。

"It could be possible; aircraft carriers are pretty freaking big," Kensuke replied.
"确实有可能；航空母舰可是相当庞大的，" Kensuke 回答说。

"Where are we landing?" asked Shinji. "On the... Othello?"
我们降落地点是哪里？" 真嗣询问道。"是在...奥赛罗号上吗？

Misato shook her head, before getting up and moving to the window Kensuke was gawking through. "We're landing on the Over the Rainbow; that one right there," she said, pointing over the boy's shoulder.
三笠摇摇头，站起身来，走到正透过窗户张望的剑介旁边。“我们要降落在那边的‘彩虹之上’，”她指着男孩的肩膀说道。

"That's the supercarrier Over the Rainbow?!" Kensuke practically shrieked in amazement. He shifted to focus his camera on the ship "The pride of the U.N. fleet is here too?!"
那难道是超级航母‘彩虹之上’？！" 健介惊叹得几乎尖叫。他赶紧调整相机对准那艘船，"连联合国舰队的骄傲也来了吗？！

With a loud groan, Asuka looked at Toji, who nodded before leaning over and slapping the back of Kensuke's head.
明日香发出一声沉重的叹息，目光转向东治，东治点头后便俯身拍了拍健介的后脑勺。

"Keep it in your pants, Ken!" he barked. "Just sit down til we land!"
肯，别乱动！坐稳了，等飞机降落再说！

Kensuke let out a sound of disappointment as he returned to his seat, rubbing his head where Toji had hit him. With a small laugh at the scene, Misato did the same. Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji watched Kensuke fidget and squirm in his seat.
健介回到座位时，失望地叹了口气，揉着被东治打中的头。目睹此景，美里不禁轻笑。真嗣用眼角余光观察到健介在座位上不安地扭动。

Soon the view outside the helicopter windows was dominated by the ships of the U.N. fleet as they flew overhead. Shinji noticed a couple of gun emplacements track their movements, and wondered if that was standard procedure. Then again, the fleet was guarding something important enough to warrant over a dozen escort ships, and possibly...
很快，直升机窗外便被联合国舰队的船只所占据，它们从头顶飞过。真嗣发现有几个炮台正追踪着他们的移动，心中纳闷这是否是常规操作。毕竟，这支舰队所守卫的东西重要到需要十几艘护卫舰护航，可能还不止于此……

There might even be submarines down there, he thought with a glance down at the ocean surface.
他低头瞥了一眼海面，心想那里说不定还潜伏着潜艇。

The cargo helicopter soon touched down on the deck of the Over the Rainbow. As expected, Kensuke was the first out the door, looking everywhere solely through the lens of his video camera. The other teenagers hopped down one after the other, giving Kensuke a wide berth as he swung wildly around, trying to take in everything at once.
货运直升机很快便降落在“彩虹之上”号的甲板上。果不其然，健介第一个冲出舱门，透过摄像机镜头四处探寻。其他青少年陆续跳下，为健介腾出空间，他旋转着身体，试图将一切尽收眼底。

And there was a lot to see, even for somebody like Shinji who wasn't all that interested in military hardware. The flight deck was wider than a highway, with planes and helicopters of various types scattered around the edges of the runway. After a glance down at the ocean, a view which gave him a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach and made him carefully back away from the edge, Shinji felt like he was standing on top of a building.
即便对军事装备兴趣寥寥的真嗣，眼前景象也颇为壮观。飞行甲板宽阔如高速公路，各式飞机与直升机错落有致地分布在跑道四周。他俯瞰海面，那深邃的蓝色令他心头一紧，不由自主地向后退了几步，仿佛置身于高楼之巅。

Men in brightly coloured uniforms were everywhere, running to and fro, checking the aircraft on the deck, moving things around, and generally making the place look busy. Several of them were now approaching the helicopter Shinji had just arrived in and were preparing to detach the cargo container it was carrying.
身着鲜艳制服的男人们遍布四周，他们忙碌地穿梭，检查甲板上的飞机，搬运物资，使得整个场所显得异常繁忙。有几人正朝着真嗣乘坐的直升机靠近，准备卸载其携带的货物集装箱。

Asuka turned to Misato as the group moved away from the helicopter to give the men space to work.
小组远离直升机，为工作人员腾出空间，这时明日香转向了美里。

"Can I go see Unit-02 now?" she practically begged.
"我现在可以去看看二号机吗？" 她几乎是恳求着说。

"Not yet, sorry," Misato replied before pointing at the tower and beginning to head in that direction, Toji and Kensuke following close behind. "We need to check in with the admiral first."
还没呢，抱歉，" 碇真嗣说着，指向塔楼并开始朝那边走去，东治和健介紧跟在后面。"我们得先跟舰长打个招呼。

"Why? He's probably watched us touch down."
为什么呢？他大概已经目睹我们着陆了。

"Protocol and politeness. Plus I need to officially hand over our cargo."
遵循协议并保持礼貌。此外，我需要正式移交我们的货物。

Shinji paused and glanced back at the cargo container. "What's in there anyway? And why are we bringing something to people that are on their way to us?"
真嗣停顿了一下，回头瞥了一眼货柜。“那里面究竟装了什么？为什么我们要给正往我们这边来的人送东西呢？”

Misato gave an airy and dismissive wave as she headed towards the tower. "Oh, nothing much. Just an emergency power cable for Unit-02."
“哦，没什么大不了的。只是给二号机送去的紧急电源线。”

"Oh, oka-" Shinji blinked as the words sunk in. "A power cable? What for? And how?"
哦，这样啊-" 真嗣眨了眨眼，话音未落。"电源线？有什么用？怎么操作？

Asuka lightly slapped his shoulder. "To power Unit-02 in case of an emergency, you dummy. This is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. It can certainly spare the juice to keep an Eva running."
明日香轻拍他的肩膀，说道：“这是为了紧急时能启动二号机，你真是的。这艘航母是核动力的，肯定有足够的电力来维持 Eva 的运转。”

Shooting her a reproachful look, Shinji hurried to catch up with Misato.
真嗣责备地看了她一眼，随即快步追上美里。

XXX

From what little Shinji could glean from all the English flying about, Vice Admiral Wilford wasn't taking kindly to the appearance of teenagers on his ship, if the practically hostile looks he kept giving them were any indication. He caught Misato saying something about NERV and the Evangelion the fleet was protecting; presumably that in an emergency she was allowed to take charge and deploy Unit-02. Then a scruffy-looking man barged onto the bridge, eliciting two very different reactions from the two females in the room.
从真嗣从周围纷飞的英语中勉强捕捉到的信息来看，海军中将威尔福德对青少年出现在他的船上显然不悦，从他频频投来的敌意目光便可窥见一斑。真嗣听到美里提及 NERV 和舰队所护卫的 Evangelion；推测在紧急情况下，她有权接管并部署 02 号机。紧接着，一个衣着邋遢的男子闯入舰桥，引发了室内两位女性截然不同的反应。

Misato suddenly looked as if she had eaten something vile, while Asuka seemed to get stars in her eyes. With an excited cry of "Kaji!", she shot across the room and wrapped her arms around the man's waist.
三嶋突然面露厌恶之色，仿佛尝到了什么恶心的东西，而明日香则眼中闪烁着光芒。她兴奋地大喊一声“加持！”，随即飞奔过房间，紧紧抱住了那个男人的腰。

Well at least that makes sense for Asuka, he mused. She's meeting her former guardian. But why is Misato acting like she's almost mad at him?
至少这对明日香来说还说得通，他思忖着。她正在见她的前监护人。但为何美里表现得几乎像是在生他的气呢？

Fortunately the man spoke Japanese.
幸好这位男士懂日语。

"Hey there, kiddo," he said as he patted Asuka on the shoulder, before gently disentangling himself. "You're looking well. Tokyo-3 been treating you alright?"
嘿，小家伙，"他轻拍明日香的肩膀，随后温和地抽身离开。"你气色不错。东京-3 的生活还适应吗？

"Well you might have heard about the Angels I killed!"
你可能听说过，我曾杀过天使！

As the two of them spoke, Shinji noticed that Asuka's body language had... dropped a couple of years. She was now acting like a giddy schoolgirl, fiddling with both her hair and the hem of her dress.
交谈中，真嗣察觉到明日香的举止似乎年轻了好几岁，她像个活泼的女学生，一会儿玩弄头发，一会儿又拉扯裙摆。

Does she... like him? he thought to himself. But Asuka is only... thirteen isn't she? This Kaji person has to be at least twice that.
她...真的喜欢他吗？他心中暗想。但明日香不过...十三岁而已，不是吗？而这个叫卡吉的人，年纪至少是她的两倍。

"And you must be the Third Child, Shinji Ikari."
那你肯定是第三适格者，碇真嗣。

He blinked. Kaji must have noticed him staring, and was now talking to him. "Um... y-yes sir. That's me."
他眨了眨眼。看来加治注意到了他的目光，现在正向他搭话。"呃...是-是的，先生。我就是。"

"The boy who struck the first blow in this strange war we've found ourselves in." The scruffy man stepped closer and held out his hand. "The name's Ryoji Kaji."
那个在我们陷入的这场莫名战争中率先发难的男孩。" 那位衣着不整的男子上前一步，伸出手自我介绍："我叫加持良治。

Vice Admiral Wilford suddenly grumbled something at the group. Withdrawing the proffered hand, Kaji shrugged and said, "Alright, let's take this little party to the mess hall and get out of the way of the admiral."
副海军上将威尔福德突然对众人嘟囔了几句。卡吉收回伸出的手，耸耸肩说：“行吧，咱们把这小聚会挪到食堂去，别碍着上将了。”

That would be a task a bit simpler said than done. One look at the elevator that would take them to the mess hall was enough. With a hand on Shinji's collar to stop him blindly following the group, Asuka announced that the two of them would wait. That didn't seem to bother any of the males, who piled into the elevator ahead of Misato. The woman turned back to wave at Shinji and Asuka, but then Shinji saw her eyes widen in shock. She opened her mouth and shouted.
那任务说起来简单，做起来却难。看一眼那部通往食堂的电梯便知。阿苏卡一把抓住真嗣的衣领，不让他盲目跟随众人，宣布两人将在此等候。这似乎并未让任何男性感到不便，他们抢在美里之前挤进了电梯。美里回头向真嗣和阿苏卡挥手，但紧接着，真嗣看到她因震惊而瞪大了眼睛。她张开口，大声呼喊。

"Which one of you boys touched m-"
你们中哪个男孩碰了我的东西？

Only to get cut off by the doors closing.
刚要过去，却被关上的门挡住了。

A few minutes later, once Asuka and Shinji made it down to the mess hall as well, the incident seemed to have been entirely forgotten. Then again, with the way Misato was still glaring at Kaji, it was hard to tell.
几分钟后，明日香和真嗣也来到食堂，那场风波似乎已烟消云散。不过，美里依旧对加持怒目而视，让人难以判断是否真的释怀了。

Whatever had happened during the aftermath of the elevator incident apparently didn't concern Kensuke at all, as he still hadn't taken the video camera away from his eye; he was eating with one hand and panning around the mess hall. Shinji could only give a bemused sigh as he got his own meal.
电梯事故后的种种似乎丝毫未影响到健介，他依旧将摄像机紧贴眼前，一边用餐一边环顾食堂。真嗣见状，只能苦笑着叹息，随后去取自己的餐食。

While Kensuke was sitting next to Misato, trying to record everything in existence, Toji was on the other side, chatting awkwardly with the woman. On the opposite side of the table Asuka was seemingly enraptured with Kaji, hanging off his every word. She didn't even notice when Shinji sat down next to her.
健介坐在美里身旁，正努力记录世间的一切，而东治则在另一侧，与那位女士尴尬地交谈。桌子的另一头，明日香似乎完全被加持迷住了，聚精会神地聆听他的每一句话，连真嗣坐到她身边都未曾察觉。

Kaji, on the other hand, did. During a lull in the conversation between himself and Asuka, he waited til Shinji finished a mouthful of food and said, "So Shinji, I hear you've had some... interesting times with your Eva."
另一方面，加持这么做了。在他与明日香的对话间隙，他等到真嗣吃完一口食物后说：“真嗣，听说你和你的 Eva 有过一些挺有意思的经历啊。”

Shinji blinked, before realisation kicked in. "Um, yes Mister Kaji," he nervously replied, his eyes flicking to the other side of the table and his two friends. "I can't really say much, but I'm unsuitable to pilot right now."
真嗣眨了眨眼，随即恍然大悟。“嗯，是的，葛城先生，”他有些局促地回答，眼神不由自主地扫向桌子对面的两位好友。“我确实不便多言，但眼下我并不适合驾驶。”

"I see," Kaji said cryptically, raising a hand to his chin in thought. He glanced at the two other boys, still focused on Misato, then back at Shinji and winked.
"我懂了，" 加治意味深长地说，手托着下巴陷入沉思。他扫了一眼另外两个男孩，他们依旧紧盯着三佐，随后又朝真嗣眨了眨眼。

Afterwards, Kaji asked Asuka to follow him, something which the redhead seemed all too eager for, and the two of them went back to the elevator. Misato, after a look from Shinji, said that Kaji probably just wanted to catch up on some more personal matters with his former ward. This time Shinji was faster on the uptake. Kaji was likely going to speak to Asuka in private about his... problem.
随后，薰邀请明日香同行，红发少女对此显得颇为热切，两人便一同走向电梯。在真嗣的注视下，美里推测薰或许只是想与昔日照顾的明日香再叙私事。这次真嗣迅速领会了。薰多半是想私下里和明日香讨论他的……难题。

Catching up apparently only took half an hour, and then Asuka was back in the mess hall. Whereupon she got Shinji's attention and pointed back at the elevator. Puzzled, he got up and followed her through the ship until they reached a spot where a small motorboat was waiting for them.
显然，追赶只花了半小时，之后明日香便返回了食堂。她引起真嗣的注意，并指向电梯。真嗣带着疑惑起身，跟随她穿过船舱，直至抵达一处，那里正停着一艘小摩托艇等候他们。

"Time to go see Unit-02," Asuka declared, before almost taking a running leap onto the boat. Shinji, keenly aware of the massive amount of water all around them combined with the fact that he couldn't swim, proceeded much more carefully. He then had to deal with several minutes of less than comfortable travel as he was bounced around in the motorboat. As a result he practically scrambled to be the first to get off once it reached the Othello, and he just barely kept himself from holding onto the metal floor of the deck.
"该去看二号机了，"明日香宣布后，几乎要飞奔上船。真嗣因四周水域辽阔且自己不谙水性，行动格外谨慎。随后，他在颠簸的摩托艇上度过了不太舒适的几分钟。因此，当船靠近奥赛罗号时，他几乎是第一个冲下船的，差点就紧紧抓住甲板上的金属地面。

"First time speeding across the waves, I take it?" Asuka remarked as she strode up to him.
"第一次体验冲浪的感觉，对吧？" 明日香说着，向他走来。

"Please tell me we won't have to do that again," Shinji gasped.
真嗣喘着气说：‘希望我们不用再经历一次。’

"Sorry, but we're gonna have to get back to the others somehow."
抱歉，我们得想办法回到其他人那边去。

"In that case I'll just stay here the rest of the trip then."
既然如此，那我就整个余下的旅程都待在这儿了。

In lieu of a response, Asuka grabbed him by the upper arm and hauled him along after her towards the tarpaulin that dominated most of the Othello's deck. He managed to shake Asuka off after a moment and sent a scowl her way, but she was focused on the tarpaulin.
明日香没有回应，而是抓住他的上臂，拽着他跟自己一起向占据奥赛罗号甲板大部分的防水布走去。他很快挣脱了，对她怒目而视，但她的注意力全在那块防水布上。

"Shinji Ikari," she said as she spun to face him. "Allow me to introduce you to the latest and greatest weapon in NERV's arsenal. The Production Model Evangelion Unit-02!"
碇真嗣，" 她转身面向他，介绍道，"这是 NERV 最新研发的强力武器——量产型福音战士二号机！

With a flourish, she pulled up as much of the tarpaulin as she could and beckoned towards the opening with her other hand.
她用力一拉，尽可能多地扯起防水布，同时用另一只手向开口处招手示意。

"Wow," Shinji breathed as he ducked his head to get under the tarpaulin. A massive red and orange Evangelion was laying prone in what was essentially a swimming pool filled with some sort of purple liquid. "It's... it's..."
哇，" 真嗣低着头钻进防水布下，不禁惊叹。一架庞大的红橙色福音战士静静地躺在装满紫色液体的池子里。"这...这是...

"Amazing, yes I know. It's mine after all."
的确令人惊叹，我当然知道，它属于我。

Shinji smiled a little at the pride he heard in Asuka's voice. "Actually I was going to say 'really really red'."
听到明日香声音中的自豪，真嗣微微一笑。"其实我想说的是'红得不得了'。"

Next to him, he heard a despairing sigh. Then, with the sound of the tarpaulin flapping, Asuka surprised Shinji by dropping from the deck down to the level of Unit-02, bending her knees to absorb the impact. After an impatient beckoning wave from her, Shinji followed suit by carefully climbing down.
他身旁响起一声绝望的叹息。随后，伴随着防水布的啪嗒声，明日香出其不意地从甲板跃至二号机所在平台，屈膝减震着地。在她急切地挥手催促下，真嗣也谨慎地跟随而下。

"Couldn't we have just taken the stairs?" he asked, pointing to where they were only a dozen meters away.
"我们直接走楼梯不行吗？"他指着不远处的楼梯问道。

Asuka scoffed. "Of course you'd say that. How boring."
明日香不屑地说：“你肯定会这么说，真是无聊透顶。”

"Better bored than injured," Shinji shot back.
"宁可无聊，也不要受伤，" 真嗣反驳说。

"Whatever, just come on."
别管那么多了，赶紧来吧。

XXX

Wilford stared out the window at the fleet surrounding his command vessel. Each ship filled with brave men and women drawn from navies all across the world, and each person sworn to give their lives in defense of it. And yet these Angel things seemed completely impervious to harm from anything the world could throw at it, save for a hideously expensive giant robot piloted by a child.
威尔福德凝视窗外，他的指挥舰被众多舰船环绕。每艘船上都是来自全球各地海军的英勇男女，他们誓言为保卫世界不惜牺牲生命。然而，这些天使般的存在似乎对任何攻击都毫发无损，唯有那台造价高昂、由孩童驾驶的巨型机器人能对其构成威胁。

Wilford gritted his teeth. A mere child could apparently accomplish what thousands of soldiers, tanks, aircraft and bombs couldn't. Such a thing made the military seem useless and incompetent, best used only as a delaying tactic while the children got picked up from school or whatever.
威尔福德咬紧牙关，心想一个小孩竟能完成数千士兵、坦克、飞机和炸弹都未能达成的任务。这使得军队显得无用且无能，似乎只适合用来拖延时间，比如在学校接孩子之类的场合。

"Sir." 先生。

Thankfully something caught Wilford's attention before he could put his fist into another bulkhead at the sheer ludicrousness of it all. The last time, it had required a welder to set right. He turned to the man who had spoken, sitting at a workstation with a phone to his ear.
幸亏有件事及时转移了威尔福德的注意力，不然他又要因极度荒谬而愤怒地向舱壁挥拳了。上次这样，还不得不请焊工来修复。他转向那个说话的人，那人正坐在工作站旁，耳朵紧贴着电话。

"What is it, ensign?" 少尉，这是什么？

The man covered the mouthpiece of the phone. "The commander of the Lurker flotilla has just reported that he's lost contact with one of his submarines, sir."
那人捂住电话的通话口，说道：“潜伏者舰队的指挥官刚刚报告，他与一艘潜艇失去了联系，长官。”

Wilford blinked, before stomping over to the ensign at his workstation and accepting the proffered phone. "This is Vice Admiral Wilford. Report."
威尔福德眨了眨眼，随即迈步走向工作台旁的少尉，接过对方递来的电话。“我是副海军上将威尔福德，请报告情况。”

The commander sounded understandably perturbed. "Sir, a minute ago Lurker Three failed to report in on time. An active sweep revealed nothing in our formation where they should be."
指挥官明显感到不安，报告道：“长官，一分钟前，潜伏者三号未按时报告。我们主动搜索了他们应在的编队位置，但一无所获。”

"Enemy action?" Wilford growled in question.
"是敌人在行动吗？"威尔福德厉声问道。

"Unknown, sir. Per orders we are running passive sensors, and nobody has detected anything out of the ordinary."
不清楚，先生。按照指示，我们正在使用被动传感器，但截至目前，还没有人报告任何异常。

"Go active," Wilford ordered. "If someone or something is trying to pick us off, they obviously already know where we are. Find out what happened to Lurker Three."
行动起来，"威尔福德下令。"既然有人或什么东西在暗中对付我们，他们肯定已知晓我们的位置。赶紧查明潜伏者三号遭遇了什么。

"Aye, sir." 是，先生。

Wilford handed the phone back to the ensign, but somebody else was already trying to get his attention. He looked at the lieutenant. "What is it?"
威尔福德把电话递回给少尉，这时已有人试图吸引他的注意。他转向中尉，问道：“怎么了？”

"An officer on the Rosencrantz has spotted debris behind us, sir," the man reported, his face looking rather uneasy. "I believe that may be our missing submarine."
罗森克兰茨号上的一名军官发现我们后方有碎片，先生，"那人报告道，神情显得颇为不安。"那很可能就是我们失踪的潜艇。

The Rosencrantz was the rearmost ship in the fleet. Wilford frowned. "What makes you so bloody sure so soon?"
罗森克兰茨号是舰队中位于最后的那艘船。威尔福德皱眉问道：“你为何这么快就如此确定？”

The lieutenant held up a pair of binoculars. "I had a look myself, sir. The debris is metal, and what little I could see appears to have come from a submarine's hull."
中尉举起双筒望远镜，说道：“我亲自查看过，长官。那些碎片是金属的，从我所能见到的来看，它们似乎来自潜艇的船体。”

Snatching the binoculars from the nervous man's hands, Wilford strode over to the stern bridge window and put them to his eyes, staring out across the ocean. A few seconds of scanning showed him the Rosencrantz, and the debris was only several hundred meters behind the destroyer.
从那紧张男子手中一把夺过望远镜，威尔福德快步走到船尾的桥窗前，将望远镜举至眼前，凝望着海面。经过几秒钟的仔细观察，他发现了罗森克兰茨号，其后方不远处便是那片残骸，距离不过数百米。

That most certainly was once a submarine. The rest of it would likely be on the ocean floor about now. Wilford turned around and addressed the bridge crew. "Signal to the fleet: Sound General Quarters, stand by for anti-submarine warfare."
那无疑曾是一艘潜艇。其余部分现在很可能已经沉在海底了。威尔福德转过身来，对舰桥上的船员们说：“向舰队发出信号：全体戒备，准备进行反潜作战。”

The bridge became a flurry of motion, and Wilford's attitude was not improved by the appearance of that purple-haired NERV captain a minute later. "Get off my bridge," he barked.
桥上瞬间忙碌起来，紫发 NERV 队长的出现让威尔福德的态度更加恶劣。"给我滚出这座桥！"他怒吼道。

Misato saluted but shook her head. "Sorry, sir, but I have my orders. Besides, I'm pretty sure I know what's abo-"
真嗣敬了个礼，却摇头道：“抱歉，长官，我必须遵守命令。况且，我大概猜到会发生什么事——”

An explosion outside cut the woman off. She and Wilford, as well as several other officers rushed to the starboard window and stared outside. One of the fleet's missile destroyers was now broken in half, both pieces burning as they sank into the sea.
突如其来的爆炸声让女子的话戛然而止。她和威尔福德以及几名警官急忙跑到右舷窗边，凝视着外面。舰队中的一艘导弹驱逐舰已被炸成两段，两截船体正燃烧着沉入大海。

"What happened?!" Wilford demanded.
"怎么了?!" 威尔福德追问道。

"Something massive rammed the ship, sir!" somebody reported.
"先生，有东西猛烈撞击了我们的船！"有人急忙报告。

"Rammed?!" 撞上了?!

Remembering the binoculars he was still holding, Wilford brought them back up to his eyes and looked in the direction of the sinking ship. He caught sight of a large off-white fin in the water before it hit another ship; a cruiser this time.
威尔福德想起自己手中还握着望远镜，便再次举起它，朝那艘正在下沉的船望去。他看到一个巨大的米白色鳍状物在水中划过，紧接着它撞上了另一艘船——这次是一艘巡洋舰。

"Red alert!" he called out. "Target that thing and blow it out of the water!"
红色警报！"他大声呼喊，"锁定那个东西，把它炸出水面！

"You may as well save your ammo, admiral."
上将，您还是节省点弹药吧。

Wilford growled and spun around to face the arrogant NERV captain. "This is a military operation and I want you off my bridge!"
威尔福德怒吼一声，转身直面那位傲慢的 NERV 队长。“这是军事行动，我命令你离开我的指挥台！”

Misato smiled sadly. "Actually, sir, this is now a NERV operation, and I am now in command. The target is an Angel, and we need to get Unit-02 active as soon as possible."
碇司令，其实现在这是 NERV 的行动，我已接手指挥。目标是一只使徒，我们得尽快让二号机启动。

"An Angel?!" he sputtered, before snarling deep in his throat and turning to look out the port window towards where the Othello was. "Damn. Give me some good bloody news," he added as he watched another ship break apart.
"天使？！"他惊讶得语塞，随即从喉咙深处发出低吼，转头望向舷窗外奥赛罗号的方向。"该死。给我点好消息，"他边说边看着另一艘船解体。

"Well if I'm right, the pilot of Unit-02 should already be over there and preparing to launch," Misato replied.
"如果我没记错，二号机的驾驶员应该已经到了，正在准备启动。" 美里回应说。

Wilford glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. "And if you're wrong?"
威尔福德斜眼瞟了她一下，问道：“万一你错了怎么办？”

Movement outside caught his eye before she could respond. The tarpaulin on the Othello was thrown aside as a giant red machine emerged from the transport ship's hold. Evangelion Unit-02 rose to its full height, wrapping the tarpaulin around its shoulders like a ragged cape. 

"You are bloody well kidding me," Wilford muttered.
"你肯定是在逗我，"威尔福德嘟囔着。

Misato grinned as a girl's voice filled the bridge.
真嗣咧嘴笑了，一个女孩的声音响彻舰桥。

"Flagship, this is Evangelion Unit Two. The fleet is under attack by an Angel. Awaiting orders."
旗舰，这里是二号福音战士机。舰队正受到使徒的袭击。请指示。

### Chapter 13 Gaghiel

Five minutes earlier... 五分钟前...

"Asuka! I think something's happening!"
明日香！我觉得有事发生了！

Asuka looked down from where she was standing on Unit-02's back. Shinji was calling out to her and pointing to the upper deck, where she could hear shouting and boots pounding on metal. Curious, she made her way over to the Evangelion's shoulder before hopping down to the gangway; an act which probably gave the worrywart Shinji a fit, but she was in a hurry. The two of them headed for the stairs at a fast jog.
明日香从她站在二号机背上的位置向下望去。真嗣正向她呼喊，并指向顶层甲板，那里她能听到叫喊声和靴子敲击金属的声音。出于好奇，她走到 EVA 的肩膀上，然后跳到舷梯上；这个动作可能让杞人忧天的真嗣心惊肉跳，但她急着赶路。两人快速向楼梯跑去。

Up on the top deck, people were gathering at the starboard side of the ship, looking out across the sea. A fighter jet flying into the distance caught Asuka's attention for a moment, but the plume of smoke coming from a ship on the other side of the Over the Rainbow seemed much more important. Shinji joined her just in time for them both to see another ship, closer to the aircraft carrier, crack in half from some unseen force.
在顶层甲板上，人们正聚集在船的右舷，眺望着海面。一架战斗机飞向远方的景象短暂吸引了明日香的注意，但彩虹桥另一侧一艘船冒出的烟柱似乎更为重要。真嗣及时加入她，两人正好目睹另一艘靠近航空母舰的船只被某种无形力量从中折断。

"Something's attacking!" Shinji exclaimed. "Is it an Angel?!"
有东西在攻击！" 真嗣惊呼道，"是使徒吗？！

Asuka stared at the wreckage for several long seconds, before her face broke into a wide grin. She grabbed Shinji's forearm and rushed back down the stairs against his confused protests. Rather than heading right for Unit-02, she took a right turn into a nearby corridor and paused for a moment. One of the three doorways here led to a room where a plugsuit was waiting for her; she found it on the second try. Letting go of Shinji's arm, she turned to him as he began to rub the spot she had been holding onto.
明日香盯着废墟看了好一会儿，脸上突然绽放出灿烂的笑容。她抓住真嗣的前臂，不顾他困惑的抗议，急忙跑下楼梯。她并没有直接前往二号机，而是右转进入了一条附近的走廊，停顿了一下。这里的三扇门中有一扇通向一个房间，里面放着她的插入栓服；她第二次尝试就找到了。放开真嗣的手臂，她转向他，而他开始揉搓她刚才抓着的地方。

"Wait here," she ordered, before glaring at him. "Don't peek, or I'll rip your eyes out and feed them to you."
在这儿等着，" 她命令道，然后狠狠地瞪了他一眼，"敢偷看的话，我就把你的眼睛挖出来喂你吃。

Shinji seemed about to question her, but automatic self-preservation made him turn around and stammer, "Y-yes Asuka!"
真嗣似乎想问些什么，但本能的自我保护让他转过身去，结结巴巴地说："是、是的，明日香！"

Asuka took three seconds to confirm that he was sufficiently warned, before roughly yanking off her dress. She kept an eye on him as her underwear dropped to the floor, and didn't relax her guard until she was fully suited up in near-record time. Just as Asuka was about to head out, she noticed that there was a second plugsuit. An idea formed in her mind and she grabbed it.
飞鸟用了三秒钟确认他已经充分警觉，随后粗暴地扯下自己的裙子。她一边留意着他，一边让内衣滑落到地板上，直到以近乎破纪录的速度全副武装完毕，才稍稍放松警惕。就在飞鸟准备出发时，她注意到还有第二套插入栓服。一个念头在她脑海中形成，她随即抓起了它。

"Here, put this on," she said, shoving the spare plugsuit at Shinji's chest as she left the room.
“把这个穿上，”她说着，将备用的插入栓服塞到真嗣胸前，随即离开了房间。

"W-wha-" “什——”

"Hurry up! We're under attack!" Asuka shouted, shoving him into the room, before placing the A-10 connectors on her head and adjusting them.
“快点！我们正遭受攻击！”飞鸟喊道，将他推进房间，然后戴上 A-10 连接器并调整好位置。

"B-but... will it fit me?" he asked as he took his shirt off.
"可...可是...这衣服我穿得上吗？" 他边问边脱下自己的衬衫。

Damn, he was skinny. Shinji really needed some exercise.
该死，他真是瘦弱。真嗣确实需要锻炼一下了。

"They're plugsuits, genius," Asuka exasperatedly replied. "They conform to our bodies. Now get a move on, that thing could be here any second!"
那是插入栓服，天才，" 明日香不耐烦地回答，"它们会贴合我们的身体。快点，那东西随时可能出现！

"...Not quite what I meant..." Shinji mumbled. He started to unbutton his pants, before giving her a pointed look. Asuka quickly turned around as she realised she had accidentally almost watched him undress. After the warning she had just given him, it would be hypocritical of her to be the voyeur.
"...我不是那个意思..." 真嗣嘟囔着。他开始解开裤子的扣子，然后给了她一个意味深长的眼神。意识到自己差点无意中目睹他更衣，明日香迅速转过身去。刚警告过他，自己若还偷看，岂不是太虚伪了。

A tense half-minute passed, with Asuka trying to block out the sounds of Shinji undressing, before he spoke again. "I... really don't think this is going to fit."
紧张的半分钟过去了，阿苏卡试图屏蔽掉真嗣更衣的声音，直到他再次开口：“我……真的觉得这衣服我穿不上。”

Asuka growled and turned around. Thankfully Shinji had pulled the plugsuit all the way on, but he hadn't activated the evacuation function yet so it was essentially hanging off of him. She stomped up to Shinji, grabbed his wrist, and slapped the button that would rapidly evacuate the suit.
阿苏卡咆哮一声，转过身来。幸好真嗣已经把插入栓服完全穿上了，但他还没启动紧急排空功能，所以衣服基本上是挂在他身上的。她大步走向真嗣，抓住他的手腕，猛地按下了快速排空按钮。

Close together as they were, Asuka got a very good look at Shinji when his eyes suddenly widened and a grunt passed his lips as if he'd just been gut punched. She blinked in confusion for a moment before looking down, and then realised why Shinji had been hesitant to put her plugsuit on.
由于两人靠得很近，当真嗣的眼睛突然睁大，嘴唇间发出一声仿佛被重击腹部的呻吟时，阿苏卡将他的表情尽收眼底。她困惑地眨了眨眼，然后低头一看，这才明白真嗣为何对穿上她的插入栓服犹豫不决。

While Shinji and Asuka were close to the same height, there was a reason why an Evangelion pilot's plugsuit was custom tailored specifically for them. While her plugsuits needed a little extra chest space, and the sight of that area on Shinji's body did give her a little mental chuckle, they didn't need room further down the body for something she didn't have.
尽管真嗣和阿苏卡身高相仿，但使徒驾驶员的插入栓服之所以量身定制，自有其原因。阿苏卡的插入栓服胸部需要稍多一点空间，看到真嗣身上那部分的景象确实让她心里暗笑了一下，但她们并不需要为身体下部留出空间，因为她没有那部分。

Essentially, Asuka had just hit Shinji in the groin.
实际上，明日香刚刚击中了真嗣的腹股沟。

"Shit, sorry," she apologised, but all he could do was give a small whine in response. She shook her head and shoved the second pair of A-10 connectors into his hands. "Look, we can argue about this later. Let's get to my Eva."
该死，对不起，"她道歉道，但他只能发出一声微弱的呜咽作为回应。她摇了摇头，把第二对 A-10 连接器塞到他手里。"听着，这事我们回头再争论。先去我的 Eva 那儿。

Shinji gave a weak nod and followed unsteadily as Asuka ran back to Unit-02. By the time she climbed back up onto its shoulder, Shinji had apparently recovered enough to get the clips on his head, and only needed a hand with the last part of the climb. Once he was up and stable, Asuka ran over to the entry plug collar and hit the button that would eject the plug. It swiftly shot out, the hatch opened, and Asuka climbed in, once again helping Shinji up after her.
真嗣无力地点了点头，步履蹒跚地跟在明日香后面跑向二号机。等她重新爬上二号机的肩膀时，真嗣似乎已经恢复到足以自己戴上连接器，只是最后一段攀爬还需要帮忙。他一稳住身形，明日香便冲到插入栓的颈部，按下按钮弹出插入栓。插入栓迅速弹出，舱门打开，明日香爬了进去，随后又帮真嗣也爬了上来。

She pretended not to notice him trying and failing to adjust his plugsuit.
她装作没注意到他试图调整自己的插入栓服却未能成功的样子。

Because of how Unit-02 was positioned, the entry plug was essentially upside down. Fortunately the designers had thought of this situation and mounted the internal structure of the plug on a gyroscope, letting Asuka get into the pilot's seat without having to sit upside down.
由于二号机的位置关系，插入栓几乎是倒置的。幸运的是，设计者考虑到了这种情况，将插入栓内部的结构安装在陀螺仪上，使得明日香无需倒坐着就能进入驾驶座。

"Shinji," she said as she hit the switch that would retract the plug and pump LCL in. "Reckon you can think in German while you're here? It'd make things much easier on me."
真嗣，" 她一边说着，一边按下开关，收回插入栓并注入 LCL。"你觉得你能在这里用德语思考吗？这样我会轻松很多。

"Erm..." 呃...

She glanced at Shinji, who was looking thoughtful. "You've got five seconds before I make up my mind."
她瞥了一眼正在沉思的真嗣。"你有五秒钟时间，之后我就自己做决定了。"

He only needed three. "Set system language to German. Aktivierungssequenz initiieren. Nervenverbindung etablieren und LCL einleiten. Gehirnwellen- und Synapsenfeinabstimmung verifiziert. Synchronisation beginnen."
他只需要三个。"将系统语言设置为德语。激活序列启动。建立神经连接并引入 LCL。验证脑波和突触微调。开始同步。"

Asuka raised an eyebrow when, after a few seconds, the error message she was halfway expecting didn't show up. LCL was already halfway up her legs. "Nice," she remarked in an impressed tone as she began speaking German too.
几秒钟后，预期的错误信息并未出现，明日香挑了挑眉。LCL 已经漫过她的双腿。"不错嘛，"她用一种赞赏的语气说道，也开始说起了德语。

Shinji grinned sheepishly before gripping onto the back of the pilot seat. Asuka turned her attention back to the heads up display for a second, before swiftly reaching an arm up and behind her and latching onto Shinji's wrist. Before he could say anything, she dragged him around to the side of her chair and shuffled back as much as she could.
真嗣腼腆地笑了笑，然后抓紧了驾驶座的靠背。明日香将注意力转回抬头显示器片刻，随即迅速伸手向后，抓住真嗣的手腕。不等他开口，她便将他拉到椅子旁，尽可能地往后挪了挪。

"Sit," she ordered, patting the seat between her knees. "I don't want you flailing around behind me once we start moving, and you can get us standing while I run through the power-on self test."
坐下，"她命令道，拍了拍两膝之间的座位。"一旦我们开始移动，我不想你在我后面乱动，而且你可以帮我进行开机自检时保持站立。

Shinji gulped, before gingerly sitting down in the space Asuka provided for him. She guided his hands to the Evangelion controls, before moving her own hands to the holographic keyboard. Unit-02 shuddered into life a moment later and she scanned the screen for any problems as the giant robot got to its feet. Gravity spun the entry plug in its socket, and the interior locked into its natural position.
真嗣咽了口唾沫，小心翼翼地在明日香为他腾出的位置坐下。她引导他的双手触碰福音战士的控制器，随后将自己的手移至全息键盘上。片刻后，二号机颤动着启动了，她紧盯着屏幕，检查是否有任何问题，巨型机器人随之站起身来。重力使插入栓在插槽中旋转，内部随即锁定至自然位置。

"Looks like we're good to..." Asuka half-muttered to herself before trailing off. She tapped a few more commands, then swore at what the screen was telling her. "Is this a fucking joke?!"
看来我们准备好了……"明日香半自言自语地说到一半便停了下来。她又敲了几下指令，然后对着屏幕上的信息咒骂起来。"这是在开什么玩笑？！

"What?" Shinji twisted as best as he could to face her. "What's wrong?"
怎么了？"真嗣尽力扭头看向她，"出什么事了？

"We're in B-Type equipment! We're out on the open ocean and those morons didn't think to prepare my Unit-02 for underwater combat! And they didn't bother loading the spike launcher either!" Asuka slammed a fist into the side of the entry plug, somewhat stymied by the liquid environment. "Always anticipate combat! You idiots!"
我们用的是 B 型装备！现在身处开阔海域，那些蠢货竟然没想到为我的二号机准备水下战斗装备！连尖刺发射器也没装载！"明日香一拳砸在插入栓侧壁上，液体环境让她有些力不从心。"总是要预料到战斗！你们这些白痴！

Out of the corner of her eye, Asuka noticed Shinji's nervous expression. She slapped a palm to her forehead and sighed. "Whatever, let's just do what we can. You okay there?"
眼角余光中，明日香注意到真嗣紧张的表情。她拍了拍额头，叹了口气。“算了，尽力而为吧。你还好吗？”

"Er... yes..." Shinji was gripping the controls so tightly, if it weren't for the plugsuit covering him Asuka was sure she'd see white knuckles on his hands.
“呃……嗯……”真嗣紧握着操纵杆，要不是有驾驶服包裹，明日香确信自己会看到他手上因用力而泛白的指节。

"Relax a little," said Asuka, patting his shoulder as a thought occurred. "You don't need to worry about not having an AT-Field. I'm here and I can use one just fine."
“放松点，”明日香说着，拍了拍他的肩膀，一个念头闪过。“你不用担心没有 AT 力场。有我在，我能很好地使用它。”

The words of encouragement seemed to work; Shinji's hands unclenched slightly. Asuka smiled at the back of his head, then keyed the comm. Since she didn't know what frequency to use, she had to make do with an all-frequency radio broadcast.
这番鼓励似乎起了作用；真嗣的手稍微松开了些。明日香对着他的后脑勺微微一笑，然后接通了通讯。由于不知道该用哪个频率，她只好将就着用全频段广播。

"Flagship, this is Evangelion Unit Two. The fleet is under attack by an Angel. Awaiting orders."
旗舰，这里是福音战士二号机。舰队正遭受使徒攻击，等待指令。

Asuka sensed some confusion from Shinji because of her polite communication. "What?" she said to the back of his head. "Misato and Akagi already got on my case once for being rude to superiors."
明日香感觉到因为自己的礼貌沟通，真嗣有些困惑。“怎么了？”她对着他的后脑勺说道，“美里和赤木之前已经因为我对上级不敬说过我了。”

"I didn't say a thing."
我什么都没说。

"Asuka, this is Misato," came a voice from the comm system. "That Angel's heading right towards you now!"
明日香，我是美里，"通讯系统中传来声音，"那个使徒正直冲你们而来！

"More good news," Asuka groaned. "How the hell are we going to get over to you? We don't have C-Type equipment."
又是好消息，"明日香抱怨道，"我们怎么过去？我们没有 C 型装备。

"I'm afraid you'll just have to jump ship, so to speak."
恐怕你们只能跳船了，打个比方。

"...Pardon?" Shinji replied in a puzzled tone. "...Do you mean... hop from ship to ship?"
...什么？" 真嗣困惑地回应，"...你是说...从一艘船跳到另一艘？

There was the sound of affronted sputtering, then a male voice said, "Those are warships, woman! Not toys!"
传来一阵被冒犯的喷嚏声，接着一个男声说道："那是战舰，女士！不是玩具！"

"That's the only option we have, Admiral," Misato stiffly replied. "Unless you can think of a way to distract that Angel for the several minutes it'll take for the Othello to pull alongside. And the Eva only has a minute's worth of power."
那是我们唯一的选择，上将，" 碇真嗣僵硬地回答道，"除非你能想到办法让那使徒分心几分钟，以便奥赛罗号能靠过来。而且初号机只有一分钟的动力。

"I don't think that's going to work anyway," said Shinji, staring at the fin disappearing in a plume of water as the Angel sped up, heading straight for them.
"我觉得那也行不通，" 碇真嗣说，他盯着那使徒的鳍消失在一股水花中，随着使徒加速，直冲他们而来。

"Damnit! All hands, brace for impact!"
该死！全员，准备迎接冲击！

The fin was very close now.
那鳍现在非常近了。

"Asuka," Shinji hesitantly began. "Do you think this will work?"
明日香," 真嗣迟疑地开口，"你觉得这招能行吗？

"Heh." The pilot of Unit-02 leaned forward, and her hands pushed Shinji's out of the way so she could control the Evangelion. Asuka felt him flinch at their unavoidable close physical contact. "I have no idea! Just let me take over for now."
哼。" 二号机的驾驶员倾身向前，双手推开真嗣的手，接管了初号机的控制。明日香感觉到他在不可避免的近距离身体接触中微微一缩。"我怎么知道！现在先让我来操作。

The fin was only a couple hundred metres away when Unit-02 crouched. A second before the Angel hit the Othello, the Evangelion took to the sky.
当二号机蹲下身时，那只鳍状物距离他们仅几百米之遥。就在使徒即将撞击奥赛罗号的前一秒，初号机腾空而起。

For several tense seconds, Unit-02 was flying, until its feet impacted on the helipad of one of the destroyers escorting the Othello. A glance back showed that the transport ship was well and truly sunk. And the Angel was turning a hard circle to come back around towards them.
紧张的几秒钟过去，二号机在空中飞跃，直至双脚稳稳落在护航奥赛罗号的一艘驱逐舰的直升机甲板上。回头一瞥，只见运输船已彻底沉没。而那使徒正急速回旋，再次向他们袭来。

"Get the cable ready!" Asuka yelled into the comm system as she prepared to jump again. Unit-02 leapt towards another ship, landing near its bow cannon. The nose of the ship dipped dangerously close to the water before managing to stabilise, but by that time the Evangelion was already flying again. One more hop brought them close to the Over the Rainbow. With a cry of "Brace yourselves!" Asuka launched Unit-02 one last time.
"准备好缆线！" 明日香对着通讯系统大喊，同时准备再次跳跃。二号机向另一艘船跃去，落在其船首炮附近。船头危险地贴近水面，好不容易才稳定下来，但那时二号机已经再次腾空。又一次跳跃使他们接近了“彩虹之上”号。随着一声“抓紧了！”的呼喊，明日香最后一次发射了二号机。

The supercarrier certainly handled the jump better than the smaller ships, although it did still tilt side to side from the impact. Several fighter jets, apparently not tied down, slipped off the flight deck and into the water. Asuka gave a small chuckle as she imagined Kensuke's reaction, while Unit-02 held onto the tower to keep from joining them. Once the supercarrier stopped tilting, she grabbed the power cable some nice workmen had left there for Unit-02 and plugged it in, sighing in relief as the countdown timer blanked itself out just before hitting twenty seconds left.
超级航母显然比小型船只更能承受这一跳跃，尽管它仍然因冲击而左右摇摆。几架显然没有固定的战斗机从飞行甲板上滑落，坠入水中。明日香想象着洞木光的反应，不禁轻笑一声，而二号机则紧抓着塔楼，以免自己也掉下去。待超级航母停止摇摆后，她抓住一些好心的工人为二号机留下的电源线，将其插入，当倒计时器在还剩二十秒时清零，她松了一口气。

"Right, now that we're here, you can put your hands back on the controls, Shinji," said Asuka as she pulled the controls upward and towards her. She flicked a switch on the side of the left controller that disconnected part of the handles and brought the sticks close enough for both of them to hold on to.
"好了，既然我们已经到了，你可以把手放回控制器上了，真嗣。" 明日香说着，将控制杆向上并向自己拉近。她在左侧控制器侧面轻触一个开关，断开了部分握把，使得操纵杆靠近，两人都能握住。

"So what's the plan?" Shinji asked as he complied with her request. "Even if we had a gun, shooting it isn't going to work."
那计划是什么？" 真嗣边问边按照她的要求行动。"即使我们有枪，射击也行不通。

"Then we'll just have to go melee," Asuka declared as she deployed Unit-02's Progressive Knife from the left shoulder pylon. As she reached up to grab it, she noticed that the tarpaulin was wrapped around her Evangelion's shoulders. She mentally shrugged and tore it away before grabbing the knife, thumbing the activation switch and sliding the blade out of its sheath. Unlike Unit-01's melee weapon, which resembled a scaled-up Bowie knife, this was more like a box-cutter with breakaway segments on the blade.
"那就只能近战了。" 明日香宣布着，从二号机的左肩部吊舱中取出进步式匕首。当她伸手去抓取时，注意到帆布缠绕在她的福音战士肩上。她心里一横，撕掉帆布，然后握住匕首，用拇指按下激活开关，将刀片从鞘中滑出。与初号机的近战武器——一把放大版的鲍伊刀不同，这更像是一把带有可拆卸刀片段的盒式切割刀。

"What if it just smashes into the ship like before?"
如果它像之前那样直接撞击船只怎么办？

The Angel leapt out of the water, providing an answer of sorts to Shinji's question as it practically belly flopped onto the flight deck and just barely missed knocking the tower over. Asuka heard the wailing of the Vice-Admiral as he complained about the damage, but put him out of her mind as she grappled with the Angel. She'd dropped the knife when it crashed into Unit-02, and got shoved away from her weapon. Together, she and Shinji tried to force the Angel away, but it was pushing them back.
天使从水中一跃而出，仿佛以一种近乎腹部着陆的方式跳上飞行甲板，险些将塔楼撞倒，这似乎是对真嗣问题的某种回答。明日香听到了副海军上将的哀嚎，他抱怨着损坏情况，但她将他抛诸脑后，全神贯注地与天使搏斗。天使撞击二号机时，她手中的刀脱手了，还被推离了自己的武器。她和真嗣一起试图将天使推开，但它却将他们逼退。

Something gave under Unit-02's right foot, and they lost their balance. Thinking quickly, Asuka grabbed onto what she could of the Angel, and heaved. The Evangelion and the Angel fell into the water together, sinking quickly to the underwater ruins that were once part of old Yokohama. As they crashed into the seabed, a cloud of dirt obscured their vision for a brief moment before Asuka felt the Angel surge forward, pulling them out of the cloud as it swam at great speed mere metres above the ground.
二号机的右脚突然踩空，他们失去了平衡。明日香迅速反应，抓住天使身上的任何可抓之处，用力一拽。于是，福音战士与天使一同坠入水中，迅速沉入曾是旧横滨一部分的水下遗迹。当他们撞击海底时，一片尘土暂时遮蔽了视线，但很快明日香感觉到天使猛地向前冲去，拉着他们冲出尘雾，以极快的速度在水面几米之上游动。

Old buildings and bridges meant nothing to the giant fish monster; it smashed through everything. All Asuka and Shinji could do was try and hang on while the Angel attempted to buck its rider. After half a minute of this wild ride, Misato's voice came through the comm system again.
老旧的建筑和桥梁对那巨型鱼怪毫无意义，它横冲直撞，所向披靡。明日香和真嗣只能尽力抓紧，而使徒则试图将这意外的乘客甩掉。经过半分钟的疯狂颠簸，美里再次通过通讯系统传来声音。

"Careful, you're about to run out of cable!"
小心，你们的缆绳快用完了！

NERV built things tough; even power lines. When the cable reached its limit, Unit-02 was jerked back and off the Angel without it snapping, and the plug's electromagnets held strong. The Angel, freed from its unwelcome passenger, swam off into the murky depths and was lost to sight within seconds as Unit-02 came to rest under an algae-covered bridge.
NERV 建造的设施异常坚固，连电线也不例外。当缆绳拉至极限时，二号机被猛地拽回，从使徒身上脱落，而缆绳并未断裂，插头的电磁铁也牢牢固定。摆脱了不速之客的使徒，随即游入浑浊的深渊，几秒内便消失在视线之外，留下二号机静止在一片藻类覆盖的桥下。

Even with both Shinji and Asuka straining to move, the Evangelion was incredibly sluggish. It was as if they were swimming in cement, not water.
尽管真嗣和明日香都竭尽全力移动，但这台福音战士却异常迟缓，仿佛他们不是在水中，而是在水泥中挣扎前行。

"Damn, are we stuck down here?" Shinji groaned as he slumped in the pilot seat.
"该死，我们被困在这里了吗？" 真嗣嘟囔着，瘫坐在驾驶座上。

"Of course not," Asuka retorted, stifling the urge to slap him across the back of the head. "The carrier can just reel us in."
当然不会，" 明日香反驳道，强忍着给他的后脑勺来一巴掌的冲动。"母舰可以直接把我们拖回去。

"Well could they hurry up on that?" Shinji pointed ahead. "It's coming back."
那他们能不能快点？" 真嗣指向前方。"它又回来了。

Out of the inky darkness swam the Angel, charging directly at its prey. It opened its mouth as it picked up speed, and Asuka's eyes widened in shock.
从漆黑的深渊中，天使游了出来，直冲向它的猎物。随着速度的加快，它张开了嘴巴，明日香的眼睛因震惊而瞪大。

"Those are..." she began.
"那些是……" 她开口道。

"...Some really big..." Shinji continued.
"...真的很大……" 真嗣接着说。

"TEETH!" they exclaimed at the same time.
"牙齿！" 他们异口同声地惊呼。

The Angel crashed into them, and Asuka found herself getting an unwanted closer look at both the Angel's dental prowess and the core in its throat. Yet somehow, the teeth weren't able to bite through Unit-02's armour; a small mercy given they were being helplessly dragged around again. Asuka was still feeling some pain through the neural link though; an ache as if something was trying to crush her waist. Somehow, it felt like it was less pain than there should be, given what her sync ratio was likely sitting at right now.
使徒猛烈撞击过来，明日香发现自己被迫近距离观察了使徒的牙齿威力和喉咙中的核心。然而，不知何故，那些牙齿未能咬穿二号机的装甲；考虑到他们再次无助地被拖行，这算是一点小小的慰藉。尽管如此，明日香通过神经连接仍能感受到疼痛，仿佛有什么东西正试图挤压她的腰部。不知怎的，这疼痛似乎比根据她当前同步率所预期的要轻一些。

And then Asuka remembered that Shinji was piloting too. Perhaps the sympathetic pain of the neural link with Unit-02 was being shared. She idly wondered what their combined sync ratio was like in this situation, but there was no time to ask; Misato was speaking again.
接着，明日香想起真嗣也在驾驶。或许与二号机神经连接的共鸣痛苦正在共享。她闲来无事地想，这种情况下他们的同步率会是多少，但没时间询问了；美里又开始说话了。

"Shinji! Asuka! Don't let that stupid fish escape!"
真嗣！明日香！别让那条蠢鱼跑了！

"Oh, don't worry Misato, we've got it right where we want it!" Shinji sarcastically yelled at the comm system.
"哦，别担心，美里，我们已经把它牢牢控制在手心里了！" 真嗣对着通讯系统讽刺地大喊。

Asuka had to bite back a snort at Shinji's surprising quip. "Yeah!" she added. "Totally about to turn this Angel into sushi in a minute!"
明日香不得不忍住因真嗣出乎意料的俏皮话而差点喷出的笑声。"没错！" 她补充道，"马上就要把这个使徒变成寿司了！"

Despite the audio-only transmission and half a kilometre of water separating them physically, Asuka could feel Misato's deadpan stare. "I've got a plan," she eventually continued as if nothing had happened, "but you need to get that Angel's mouth open!"
尽管只是音频传输，且有半公里深的水层将她们物理隔开，但明日香仍能感受到美里那无表情的凝视。"我有个计划，"她最终继续说道，仿佛什么都没发生过，"但你们得让那使徒张开嘴！"

"Good thing it's already trying to eat us then," replied Asuka. The transmission ended, and she turned her attention to Shinji. "Come on, we're going to have to work together on this."
幸好它已经在试图吃我们了，"明日香回应道。通讯结束，她转向真嗣。"来吧，这次我们得合作才行。

"But we tried that before," said Shinji. "We barely moved at all."
但我们之前试过了，"真嗣说。"我们几乎没动。

"I don't think we were, actually." Before the Angel had grabbed them, it had felt to Asuka like it wasn't just the water working against Unit-02. "I think we were trying to do slightly different things, and ended up accomplishing nothing. I want you to follow my lead now."
我觉得我们其实并没有，"明日香说。在被使徒抓住之前，她感觉不仅仅是水在对抗二号机。"我想我们当时试图做的是略有不同的事情，结果什么也没做成。现在我希望你跟着我行动。

Asuka felt Shinji's hands clench on the controls. "Okay," he agreed. "Tell me what to do."
明日香感觉到真嗣紧握操纵杆的手。“好的，”他同意道，“告诉我该怎么做。”

"Right." Asuka closed her eyes and concentrated on the neural link. Stuck partway in the Angel's mouth, they couldn't see much, but she could feel her 'legs' trailing freely in the water. "First we need to get our feet into a spot where we can exert some pressure."
“对。”明日香闭上眼睛，专注于神经连接。卡在使徒的口中，他们看不到太多，但她能感觉到自己的“腿”在水里自由摆动。“首先，我们需要把脚放到一个能施加压力的位置。”

With a shaky start, the Evangelion's legs began to move, bending at the knees and bringing the feet up to the Angel's lips. Asuka continued giving directions, and Unit-02 began to strain against the strength of the Angel's jaw.
初时有些颤抖，但福音战士的双腿开始移动，膝盖弯曲，脚尖抵住使徒的唇边。明日香继续给出指示，二号机开始与使徒的咬合力抗衡。

"Good work," she encouragingly said to Shinji. "Let's keep this up."
“干得好，”她鼓励地对真嗣说，“我们继续保持。”

"You're running out of time!" came Misato's voice. "Get that mouth open!"
你快没时间了！" 传来美里焦急的声音。"快把那嘴张开！

Asuka and Shinji began to growl and groan as they put everything they had into their efforts. As massive and powerful as the Angel was, its jaw began to give way under the might of Unit-02 and its two pilots.
明日香和真嗣开始发出低沉的吼声和呻吟，他们倾尽全力。尽管天使巨大而强大，但在二号机及其两位驾驶员的合力下，它的下颚开始支撑不住。

"Getting there..." 就快了……

"Gotta keep... pushing!" 得继续……推！

"Open! Open!" they began to chant together.
"打开！打开！"他们开始齐声呼喊。

Asuka felt a surge, and her vision went white for a split second as Unit-02's arms forced the Angel's jaws wide open.
明日香感到一股力量涌动，视野瞬间一片空白，二号机的双臂奋力将使徒的嘴撑开。

Just in time for two massive ships to pass them on either side, smashing through the Angel's teeth like they weren't there and burying themselves in its throat. Asuka just barely had enough time to read the English word 'Kentucky' on one of the ships before their bow cannons fired and she felt herself being knocked away by the shockwave. The cable retracted, pulling Unit-02 to the surface, and Asuka observed the Angel's body briefly expanding as it tried to contain the power of two sets of battleship cannons.
恰好两艘巨舰从两侧掠过，无视使徒的利齿，直插其咽喉。明日香刚来得及瞥见一艘船上印着的英文单词"肯塔基"，舰首炮便轰然发射，冲击波将她震飞。缆索回缩，将二号机拉回水面，明日香目睹使徒的身躯短暂膨胀，试图承受两组战舰炮的威力。

It failed miserably. 结果却是一败涂地。

The ocean turned pink as the Angel simply exploded. A second shockwave, one that put the first to shame, sent Unit-02 hurtling through the water towards the surface faster than the cable was retracting. The Evangelion broke the surface and went flying through the air once more. Seeing the remnants of the U.N. fleet below them, Asuka tried her best to get their unexpected flight under control and angle them towards the supercarrier. The retracting cable did most of the work, and Unit-02 touched down in a three-point landing back on the flight deck of the Over the Rainbow as displaced seawater rained down upon them. The supercarrier rocked back and forth, threatening to tip them back into the water, but it soon settled back down.
当天使简单地爆炸时，海洋变成了粉红色。紧接着，一股比第一波更为强烈的冲击波，将二号机以比电缆回收更快的速度推向水面。使徒冲破海面，再次飞向空中。看到下方联合国舰队的残骸，明日香尽力控制这次意外的飞行，调整方向朝超级航母飞去。回收的电缆完成了大部分工作，二号机以三点着陆的方式降落在“彩虹之上”号的飞行甲板上，溅起的海水如雨般落下。超级航母摇摆不定，似乎要将他们再次倾倒入海中，但很快又稳定了下来。

Asuka slumped back in her seat and let out a sigh of relief. In front of her, Shinji was hunched over, still holding onto the controls. She tapped the back of his head. "It's over now, you can let go."
明日香瘫坐在座位上，长舒了一口气。在她面前，真嗣仍然弯腰握着控制杆。她轻拍了一下他的后脑勺，“现在结束了，你可以放手了。”

"Oh." Shinji straightened up and released the controls. He shook the stiffness out of his hands, before leaning back.
“哦。”真嗣挺直身子，松开了控制杆。他活动了一下僵硬的手指，然后向后靠去。

Right into Asuka's chest.
正好靠在了明日香的胸前。

"You can also get out of my seat now," she pointedly added, trying to ignore the body heat leeching through their plugsuits. "Before I start to wonder why you're still sitting in it." For emphasis, she made a fist and waved it in front of his face.
"你现在也可以从我的座位上起来了，"她刻意补充道，试图忽略透过他们的插入栓服传递过来的体温。"不然我就要开始怀疑你为什么还坐在上面了。"为了强调，她握紧拳头在他面前晃了晃。

Shinji wisely got up quickly, face bright red as he moved around to the back of the pilot seat.
真嗣识趣地迅速起身，脸涨得通红，绕到驾驶座后面。

"Great job, you two!" 干得好，你们俩！

Asuka turned Unit-02's head to the tower, where she could barely make out Misato's mop of purple hair among black and brown heads and white hats. She waved the Evangelion's right hand at them, and was surprised to see something clutched in it. Opening the hand, Asuka saw that she had somehow held onto part of one of the Angel's massive incisors.
明日香操控着二号机转头望向指挥塔，勉强在黑压压的人群和白色帽子中辨认出美里那一头紫色的乱发。她挥动着使徒的右手向他们致意，却惊讶地发现手中紧握着什么。张开手掌，明日香发现自己不知怎地抓着了使徒巨大獠牙的一部分。

"Decided to keep a souvenir of your kill, huh Asuka?" Misato asked.
"决定留下你击杀的纪念品了，是吧，明日香？" 美里问道。

"I... guess?" Asuka hesitantly replied. "I don't remember grabbing it though."
我... 算是吧？" 明日香迟疑地回答。"不过我不记得自己拿过它。

"Er, that might have been me," said Shinji. "When those ships hit, I tried to grab something to hang onto before I realised what was happening."
呃，那可能是我，" 真嗣说。"当那些船只撞击时，我试图抓住什么东西来稳住自己，然后才意识到发生了什么。

Asuka turned in her chair to give him a look. "Why do I get the feeling you were also the reason why my Eva was wearing that tarp like a freaking cape?"
明日香转过椅子，向他投去一瞥。"为什么我有种感觉，我的 Eva 像披风一样披着那块油布，也是你的杰作？"

The suddenly shifty expression on Shinji's face told her everything.
真嗣脸上突然闪过的表情告诉了她一切。

XXX

With the Angel dead, the fleet swept the area for survivors from the half-dozen ships that it had sunk, as well as the evacuees from the Illinois and Kentucky. Unit-02 helped where it could, scooping entire life rafts up onto the flight deck of the Over the Rainbow.
随着使徒被消灭，舰队开始在区域搜寻沉没的半打舰船上的幸存者，以及伊利诺伊号和肯塔基号上的撤离人员。二号机尽其所能提供帮助，将整艘救生筏捞起，放到彩虹号航母的飞行甲板上。

Now the tattered fleet was pulling into port near Tokyo-3. It would be a strange sight for anybody watching: a giant red robot kneeling on the prow of a massive ship, both looking like they had... well... picked a fight with a giant monster. The tooth had been wedged into an aircraft elevator just in front of Unit-02, something which Vice Admiral Wilford probably complained about.
如今这支破败的舰队正驶入东京-3 附近的港口。对于任何旁观者来说，这将是一幕奇异的景象：一架巨大的红色机器人跪在巨舰的船首，两者看起来都像是……嗯……与一只巨型怪兽打了一架。那颗牙齿被卡在了二号机前面的飞机升降机上，这事大概会让副海军上将威尔福德抱怨不已。

Unit-02 was loaded onto a train that would take it directly to the Geofront. Now that she could see it from the outside, Asuka could clearly see the puncture marks in its armour. That only lent more credence to her theory that she and Shinji had shared the neural feedback, especially considering the size of the tooth Shinji had inadvertently snatched. Even though it was apparently only half a tooth, it still came up to her shoulders when it was stood up. Kensuke had begged to be allowed to take it home, but NERV was only going to be so lenient with what they permitted him to do. He was lucky enough to not have his video camera confiscated.
二号机被装载上了一列直达 Geofront 的火车。现在从外部观察，明日香清晰地看到了装甲上的穿刺痕迹。这更加证实了她的理论，即她和真嗣共享了神经反馈，尤其是考虑到真嗣无意中抓到的那颗牙齿的大小。尽管那显然只是半颗牙齿，但竖立起来时，它的高度仍能达到她的肩膀。剑介曾恳求允许他将它带回家，但 NERV 对于允许他做的事情只会如此宽容。他很幸运，没有被没收摄像机。

And speaking of the nerd...
说到那个书呆子...

"Excuse me, ma'am," came Kensuke's voice from behind. Asuka turned around, instantly wary of the jovial tone in his voice, but he wasn't talking to her. He and Toji were facing the other way and focused on Shinji, or rather the plugsuit he was wearing.
"打扰一下，女士，"剑介的声音从后面传来。明日香转过身，立刻对他那愉快的语气保持警惕，但他并不是在对她说话。他和东治背对着她，正注视着真嗣，或者更确切地说，是他身上的插入栓服。

"We're lookin' for our friend Shinji. You seen him anywhere, miss?" Toji asked, clearly trying to keep a laugh from bursting out of his mouth.
"我们在找我们的朋友真嗣。您在哪儿见过他吗，小姐？"东治问道，显然在努力抑制住从嘴里爆发出的笑声。

"Oh come on, you two!" Shinji whined, trying to cover everything with just his hands. "This thing is really uncomfortable and my clothes are somewhere at the bottom of the ocean by now!"
哎呀，你们俩！" 真嗣抱怨道，试图仅用双手遮掩一切。"这东西真的很不舒服，而且我的衣服现在估计沉在海底了！

In any other circumstance, Asuka might have joined in, giving a couple of her own jabs before telling the nerd and the jock to cut it out. But Shinji had just helped her kill an Angel. He'd fought beside her... figuratively speaking, and he deserved some goddamn respect.
换作其他情况，明日香或许会加入进来，先回敬几句，然后让书呆子和运动员别闹了。但真嗣刚刚帮她消灭了一个使徒。他曾与她并肩作战...虽然只是象征性的，但他理应得到一些该死的尊重。

She caught Shinji's eye and put a finger to her lips to signal him to be quiet as she sneaked up behind the pair of cackling idiots, her rubber-clad feet ensuring almost complete silence on the metal deck. As Toji threw another verbal jab at her fellow pilot she reached out both hands, positioning them on either side of the two juvenile boy's heads.
她与真嗣眼神交汇，用手指轻触嘴唇示意他保持安静，同时悄无声息地从背后接近那两个笑得正欢的傻瓜，橡胶包裹的双脚在金属甲板上几乎未发出任何声响。当东治再次对她的同僚驾驶员出言不逊时，她伸出双手，分别放在两个幼稚男孩的脑袋两侧。

And then Shinji set thing up beautifully.
然后，真嗣巧妙地设下了局。

"Hey guys," Shinji said, interrupting Toji's latest insult. "Does it hurt to be so insensitive?"
嘿，伙计们，" 真嗣插话道，打断了东治的最新侮辱。"这么迟钝，不痛吗？

"Huh?" 啊？

"Whaddaya me-" 你什么意-

Asuka struck, slamming Toji and Kensuke's heads together like a pair of difficult blackboard dusters. The two boys almost fell over as their thick skulls rebounded off each other, and they turned on their assailant with angry words on their lips only to trail off as they saw who was behind them. Kensuke gave what he probably thought was a disarming grin, but the headlock he suddenly found himself in proved that Asuka was very much armed and dangerous.
明日香突然出手，将东治和健介的脑袋像一对难缠的黑板擦一样猛地撞在一起。两个男孩的厚头骨相互反弹，差点摔倒，他们转过身来，正要对着袭击者怒骂，却突然停住了，因为他们看到了站在身后的人。健介可能以为自己的笑容能缓和气氛，但他突然发现自己被锁喉，这证明明日香既武装到牙齿，又极度危险。

At least Toji had the decency to be apologetic. "Er, sorry Red. And Shinji," he mumbled.
至少东治还有点歉意，他含糊地说：“呃，对不起，小红。还有真嗣。”

Asuka simply stared at him while Kensuke flailed helplessly in her grip. "Hey Shinji," she said, glancing at the boy in question. "Reckon I should make this idiot walk the plank?"
明日香只是盯着他，而光司在她手中无助地挣扎。“嘿，真嗣，”她瞥了一眼那个男孩，说道，“你说我是不是该让这个笨蛋走跳板？”

"Er..." “呃……”

A tired voice called out to her. "Please don't throw anybody in the ocean. I'll probably have to fill out even more paperwork!"
一个疲惫的声音向她喊道：“请别把任何人扔进海里。我可能还得填更多的表格！”

The teenagers turned to regard the newcomer, who turned out to be Misato. Following close behind, staring at a sheaf of papers in her hands, was Doctor Akagi.
少年们转头看向新来者，原来是美里。紧随其后，手里拿着一叠文件，正专注地看着的是赤木博士。

"Hello Misato," said Shinji. "Are we going home yet?"
你好，美里，" 真嗣说道，"我们现在可以回家了吗？

"Soon," Misato replied, looking like she was about to collapse. "The car from NERV should be here in a few minutes."
快了，" 美里回答，看起来快要支撑不住了。"NERV 的车应该几分钟内就到。

"Why do you look so exhausted, Misato?" Asuka wondered. "We're the ones that fought a big fish, but you look like you did it barehanded."
美里，你怎么看起来这么疲惫？" 明日香好奇地问，"明明是我们去和大鱼战斗了，你却一副徒手搏斗过的样子。

Misato gave her a flat-eyed stare. "I am not looking forward to going back to my office," she growled. "Do you know how much paperwork sinking two battleships creates?"
葛城美里用无神的眼睛盯着她。“我一点也不期待回办公室，”她咆哮道，“你知道击沉两艘战舰会带来多少文书工作吗？”

"But that's what killed the Angel, right?" said an uncertain Shinji.
“但那不就是消灭使徒的方法吗？”碇真嗣有些不确定地说。

"Doesn't matter. We still need to account for stuff like the ordnance they carried, among other things." Misato slowly collapsed onto her knees on the ground, covering her face with her hands and groaning loudly. "I'm gonna be busy for ages."
“那不重要。我们还得处理它们携带的弹药之类的事情，还有其他一堆事。”美里缓缓跪倒在地，双手捂脸，大声呻吟，“我要忙上好一阵子了。”

Doctor Akagi cast a sympathetic look at her companion before turning her attention to Asuka. "So the two of you worked together to fight the Angel, correct?" she asked.
赤木博士向她的同伴投去同情的目光，随后转向明日香。“这么说，你们俩是联手对抗使徒的，对吧？”她问道。

Asuka nodded. "Yeah. Shinji was able to think in German, so that made things easier." She recalled what she had wondered during the fight. "What was our sync ratio like?"
明日香点了点头。“对，真嗣能用德语思考，这让事情变得简单多了。”她回忆起战斗中的疑惑，“我们的同步率怎么样？”

Doctor Akagi studied her notes for a moment. "Well it was all over the place for a start. Forty-one percent during your little hopscotch game, fifty-seven percent when you fell into the water, thirty-eight while you were drifting down there..."
赤木博士审视了一会儿她的笔记。“一开始就很不稳定。在你玩跳房子游戏时是 41%，掉进水里时是 57%，在水下游荡时则是 38%……”

"But we were working together though," said Shinji. "Well, besides when Asuka was getting us to the power socket. Why was it so erratic everywhere else?"
“但我们确实是在合作啊，”真嗣说。“除了明日香带我们去电源插座那会儿。为什么其他时候同步率这么不稳定？”

"There are quite a few possibilities," replied Akagi. "You might have been trying to do different things at the same time, for instance. Your own thought noise would have been creating quite a bit of interference. Not to mention that we didn't exactly design the Eva control systems to allow for two pilots. But... you two worked together perfectly when it counted. Would you like to know the maximum sync ratio you reached during the fight?"
“可能性有很多，”赤木回答道。“比如你们可能在同时尝试做不同的事情。你们自身的思维噪音就会产生相当大的干扰。更不用说，我们原本就没设计让两个驾驶员同时操控 Eva。但是……关键时刻你们俩配合得天衣无缝。想知道战斗中达到的最高同步率吗？”

"Oooh! Tell us!" Asuka practically began to bounce as she tried to guess the result herself. "Eighty? Ninety? Oh, if it was a hundred..."
哦哦！快告诉我们！" 明日香几乎要跳起来了，她自己也在试图猜测结果。"八十？九十？哦，如果是一百...

Doctor Akagi smirked and held out a page. Asuka took it, finally releasing Kensuke who ran off gasping, and brought it over to Shinji. They both stared at the paper, practically touching heads as they read the number circled in red ink.
赤木博士带着一丝坏笑，递出一张纸。明日香接过纸，终于放开了喘不过气来的洞木，跑到真嗣身边。两人头挨着头，紧盯着那张纸上用红笔圈出的数字。

"One hundred..." Asuka began.
"一百..." 明日香开口道。

"...And forty-eight..." Shinji continued.
"...四十八..." 真嗣接着说。

"Percent," they finished together.
"百分比，" 他们异口同声地说。

"Holy shit!" Asuka swore in German, dropping the paper as she took a few paces backward, bringing both hands up to cradle her head. "Holy shit..."
我的天哪！" 明日香用德语咒骂着，丢下手中的纸张，向后退了几步，双手抱头。"我的天哪……

"Oh wow," said Shinji, more subdued but clearly stunned at the revelation. "I didn't know that was even possible..."
哦，哇，" 真嗣说道，虽然语气更为克制，但显然被这个发现震惊了。"我没想到这竟然可能……

"The numbers don't lie, Shinji," Doctor Akagi said as she picked up the dropped paper and returned it to her stack. "You only maintained it for six seconds, but for that brief period the two of you were perfectly in tune with each other. Well done." She turned to leave, but glanced back at Shinji over her shoulder. "Today has brought me one massive step closer to a solution for you. In a week or so I might be able to show you what I have in mind."
数据不会说谎，真嗣，" 赤木博士说着，捡起掉落的纸张，放回她的文件堆中。"你只维持了六秒钟，但那短暂的时间里，你们俩完全同步了。做得好。" 她转身欲走，却又回头瞥了真嗣一眼。"今天让我离解决方案又近了一大步。大约一周后，我或许能向你展示我的想法。

Doctor Akagi headed off towards Unit-02 without a word of farewell, returning her attention to the papers in her hands.
赤木博士一言不发地朝着二号机走去，目光重新落回手中的文件上。

"A hundred and forty-eight percent!" Asuka shouted, still not believing what she had read and not noticing the exit of the scientist. "That's just... wow! What a way to break the record!" She turned to Shinji and grabbed him by the shoulders. "Even if we split it, that's seventy-four percent each! Still record-breaking!"
百分之一百四十八！" 明日香喊道，仍然不敢相信自己所读到的数字，并未注意到科学家的离去。"这简直是...哇！破纪录的方式太惊人了！" 她转向真嗣，抓住他的肩膀。"即使我们平分，每人也有七十四！仍然是破纪录的！

"But we still feel more pain as our sync ratio climbs," Shinji reasoned. "What would have happened if that Angel managed to bite through the Eva?"
但随着同步率上升，我们感受到的痛苦也更多，" 真嗣分析道。"如果那个使徒真的咬穿了 Eva 会怎样？

That brought a jubilant Asuka up short. She took a step back, rubbing her hip as she recalled the phantom pain while looking up at the corresponding point on Unit-02 where there was a hole in the armour. "Well...," she hesitantly began, "it's apparently only sympathetic pain until you get close to one hundred percent, and that's when your body starts taking the damage as well. But we were sharing it, so we're both fine." She glanced at Shinji. "Right?"
这话让兴高采烈的明日香顿时语塞。她后退一步，揉着臀部，回忆起那虚幻的疼痛，同时抬头望向二号机装甲上对应的破洞处。"嗯...，" 她迟疑地开口，"据说只有接近百分百时，你的身体才会开始承受实际伤害，而且我们当时是共享的，所以我们都没事。" 她瞥了一眼真嗣。"对吧？"

"Well-" 嗯-

Asuka suddenly slapped the spot on Shinji's hip where the hole in Unit-02's armour was. He recoiled, bringing up a hand to cover it as he yelped in pain.
明日香突然拍打了真嗣臀部上装甲破洞的位置，那里正是二号机受损之处。他痛得一缩，急忙用手捂住，痛呼出声。

"How does it feel? Does it ache or have you been stabbed?"
感觉怎么样？是疼还是像被刺了一样？

"...Just a bit of an ache," Shinji admitted with a scowl.
"...只是有点疼而已，" 真嗣皱着眉头承认道。

"Then we're both fine. Anyway," Asuka jabbed a finger into his chest. "You know what this means now, right?"
那我们都没事了。不管怎样，" 明日香用手指戳了戳他的胸口，"你现在明白这意味着什么了吧？

"That we shouldn't let our sync ratio get too high?" Shinji incorrectly guessed.
"是说我们不应该让同步率升得太高吗？" 真嗣错误地猜测道。

Asuka once again resisted the urge to slap him across the back of the head. Shinji could be surprisingly bright sometimes, while also somehow being incredibly dim. "No, genius. It means we have to really knuckle down and train if we're going to beat our record!"
明日香再次忍住了想要朝他后脑勺拍一巴掌的冲动。真嗣有时候出奇地聪明，但不知怎么的，又总是显得特别迟钝。"不，天才。这意味着如果我们想打破记录，就必须真正下功夫训练了！"

"Oh. Um... okay." 哦。嗯... 好的。

"Sheesh, tone it down a little, you're getting enthusiasm all over me," Misato sarcastically said, hopping back up to her feet. She patted her hair back into place as she looked out towards the port entrance. A black car was waiting for them. "Our ride's here, so time to stop flirting with him, Asuka. You can pick it up again later."
哎呀，收敛点儿，你那热情都溅我一身了。" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷讽刺地说着，一跃而起，拍了拍头发整理好，望向港口入口。一辆黑色轿车正等着他们。"我们的车到了，所以别再跟他调情了，明日香。回头再继续吧。

"Wh-whaaatt?!" the two pilots shouted at the same time, their faces heating up. Asuka, finally noticing how physically close she was to Shinji, leapt backwards in shock. "W-we're not flirting!"
什——什么？！" 两位驾驶员异口同声地喊道，脸颊泛红。明日香这才意识到自己离真嗣有多近，惊得往后一跳。"我们——我们才没有调情！

"Could have fooled me," Misato shot back as she headed towards the car. "Seems like today has seen you two get a little friendlier with each other. It's rather obvious how you were both able to pilot at the same time." She flashed them a grin over her shoulder. "Should I be keeping a closer eye on your apartment?"
我差点就信了。" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷回敬道，朝车子走去。"看来今天你们俩关系更近了一步。你们能同时驾驶，这已经很明显了。" 她回头向他们眨了眨眼。"我是不是该多盯着点你们的公寓？

"Mi-Misato!" Shinji angrily stammered. "A-are we going back to the Geofront or what?!"
惣——惣流小姐！" 真嗣气愤地结巴着。"我——我们是要回 Geofront 吗？！

To Asuka's great relief, Misato decided to let the matter drop. She shook her head at the question. "Nah, I'm getting dropped off there, but you and your friends are going home." She glanced at Shinji. "Probably not a good idea for you to be out and about like that. Red looks good on you, Shinji, but with that face somebody might mistake you for a boy."
令明日香大为宽慰的是，美里决定不再追究此事。她对着问题摇了摇头，“不了，我会在那里下车，但你和你的朋友们得回家。”她瞥了一眼真嗣，“你这样在外面晃荡可能不太好。真嗣，红色很适合你，但看你这张脸，别人可能会误以为你是男孩。”

Asuka swiftly brought up a hand to cover the snort that threatened to burst forth. Shinji was a little slower on the uptake, but he soon caught on.
明日香迅速举起一只手，捂住差点喷薄而出的嗤笑。真嗣反应稍慢，但很快也明白了过来。

"Misato!" 美里！

The heavy industrial case was lowered gently onto the desk. The scruffy man slowly unfastened the locks keeping it shut, and then opened it up. He spun it around to show the contents to the man sitting at the desk, who gave a smirk behind his interlaced gloved hands before standing up.
沉重的工业用箱子被轻轻放在桌上。那个邋遢的男人缓缓解开锁扣，然后将其打开。他转过箱子，向坐在桌前的男人展示里面的东西，后者在交叠的手套后露出一丝冷笑，随即站起身来。

"Exceptional. You have performed well, Ryoji Kaji," said Gendo Ikari, leaning in to stare at the case's contents.
“非常出色。你做得很好，加持良治。”源堂说罢，倾身凝视着箱中之物。

"You know, you could have warned me about the surprise visitor today," Kaji remarked as he took a few steps away from the desk and looked idly out the massive windows in the gigantic office. "I had to leave poor Katsuragi high and dry while I scarpered."
你知道的，你本可以提前告诉我今天会有不速之客，" 薰一边说着，一边从办公桌旁走开，漫不经心地望向巨大办公室里那排壮观的窗户。"我不得不让可怜的葛城孤立无援，自己却溜之大吉。

"That 'visitor' is why I ensured that two pilots would be available," replied Gendo. "In any case, it would have attacked Unit-02's transport even if this hadn't been in the area." He indicated the contents of the case.
"那位‘访客’正是我确保有两名驾驶员待命的原因，" 源渡回答道。"无论如何，即使它不在这片区域，也会袭击二号机的运输。" 他指了指箱子里的东西。

"The linchpin of Human Instrumentality, eh?" said Kaji, turning to regard the strange thing inside the case. It had the appearance of a shrivelled fetus, encased in a block of solid orange material and stored inside a case that kept it frozen but apparently alive. It had been quite a task to 'retrieve' it from NERV Berlin without anybody noticing. Considering how rarely anybody there actually checked inside the vault that had once contained it, however, he was confident that it would be quite a while before his substitution would be noticed.
"人类补完计划的关键，是吧？" 薰转过身来，注视着箱子里那个奇异的东西。它看起来像是一个干瘪的胎儿，被封在一块坚硬的橙色物质中，存放在一个使其保持冷冻状态、显然还活着的箱子里。从 NERV 柏林悄无声息地"取回"它，可不是件容易的事。不过，考虑到那里的人很少检查曾经存放它的保险库，他有信心，他的调包计要被发现，还得等上一段时间。

Gendo nodded. "The first human being, right here in front of us." He reached up one hand to adjust his glasses, and the artificial sunlight streaming into the office glinted sharply off them. His other hand gently caressed the block of orange material.
源渡点了点头。“第一个人的存在，就在我们眼前。”他伸手调整了一下眼镜，办公室内的人造阳光在镜片上闪过一道锐利的光芒。他的另一只手则轻柔地抚摸着那块橙色物质。

"This... is Adam." “这... 就是亚当。”

### Chapter 14 I Can Taste It!

One of the last things Shinji expected when he woke up was to already smell food. As the primary source of meals for four and a half people, two of which practically had to be bribed out of bed in the morning, it came as a bit of a surprise. Puzzled, he threw off the thin sheet that the previous too-warm night had practically required him to sleep under. After covering the horrifying sight of his pale chest with one of the shirts Asuka had 'encouraged' him to buy, Shinji followed his nose out of his bedroom.
真嗣醒来时最没预料到的事情之一，就是已经闻到了食物的香味。作为四口半之家主要的餐食供应者，其中两人几乎每天早上都要被哄着起床，这着实让他感到意外。带着困惑，他掀开了那条薄被，前一晚的闷热几乎让他不得不盖着它入睡。在用明日香“鼓励”他买的一件衬衫遮住自己苍白的胸膛后，真嗣循着香味走出了卧室。

And almost walked right into somebody.
差点直接撞上某个人。

"Good morning, Shinji," said the blue and white blur as he backpedalled. "I was about to wake you up."
“早上好，真嗣，”那团蓝白相间的身影后退着说道，“我正要去叫醒你。”

His eyes still slightly bleary, Shinji squinted at her for a moment before realising who was talking to him. "Oh, good morning Rei." He glanced over her shoulder towards the kitchen. "Are you making breakfast?"
眼睛还有些朦胧，真嗣眯着眼看了她一会儿才认出是谁在跟他说话。“哦，早上好，零。”他越过她的肩膀望向厨房，“你在做早餐吗？”

Rei gave a shake of her head. "No. Asuka has taken on that duty."
绫波摇了摇头，“不，明日香已经承担了那个任务。”

A disbelieving frown crossed Shinji's face. "Are you saying that Asuka actually got out of bed before eight o'clock on a Sunday?"
真嗣脸上掠过一丝难以置信的皱眉，“你是说，明日香居然在周日早上八点前就起床了？”

The redhead in question called out from the kitchen. "Damn right I did!" Asuka poked her head around the corner. "I suppose you can blame Rei for this, sort of."
话题中的红发少女从厨房喊道，“没错，我就是这么早起的！”明日香探出头来，“我想你可以怪绫波，算是吧。”

At a glance from Shinji, Rei clarified, "Your inability to taste food is a hazard. If something has gone bad and you do not notice, you risk poisoning yourself or others. Yesterday I recalled something I read in one of my medical textbooks, and informed Asuka of the risks of such a condition."
在真嗣的一瞥下，绫波解释道，“你尝不出食物的味道是个隐患。如果有什么变质了你没察觉，就可能让自己或他人中毒。昨天我记起在医学课本上读到过相关内容，便告知了明日香这种状况的风险。”

Shinji blinked, stunned that he hadn't thought of so obvious a problem with... whatever had caused his sense of taste to atrophy. Especially after practically giving himself food poisoning from Misato's 'curry'. He looked at Asuka. "So... you've decided to take over cooking duties then?" he gloomily asked.
真嗣眨了眨眼，惊讶于自己竟然没意识到这个显而易见的问题——无论是什么导致他的味觉退化。尤其是在几乎因为美里做的“咖喱”而食物中毒之后。他看向明日香，沮丧地问道：“那么……你决定接管做饭的任务了？”

Asuka nodded apologetically. "Sorry. Sure you were still a decent cook, but your meals were rather bland, and I don't think NERV would be too happy if its pilot corps and tactical officer all got sick at the same time because of one mistake."
明日香带着歉意点了点头。“抱歉。我知道你做饭还不错，但你的饭菜实在太平淡了，而且我想 NERV 也不希望因为一个失误，导致所有驾驶员和战术指挥官同时生病。”

Shinji sighed. One less thing he was capable of doing for people now.
真嗣叹了口气。现在又少了一样他能为大家做的事情。

Either the disappointment was written all over his face, or Asuka somehow sensed his dropping mood, because she immediately brushed past Rei to stand face-to-face with him. "Don't start with the griping, Ikari. I'm not doing this because I want to take away something you like doing."
或许是失望之情写满了他的脸，又或是明日香不知怎的感觉到了他情绪的低落，她立刻从零身边走过，站到他面前，直视他的眼睛。“别抱怨了，碇。我这么做不是想夺走你喜欢做的事情。”

"I know, but..." Shinji looked away. "What's left for me to do now? I can only clean so much..."
我知道，但是..." 真嗣转过头去。"我现在还能做什么呢？我只能打扫这么多...

"What's left?" Asuka echoed. She pointed in the vague direction of the Geofront. "What about whatever Doctor Akagi's got planned? That egghead believes she's onto something that'll let you pilot as well."
剩下什么？" 明日香重复道。她指向了 Geofront 的大致方向。"那赤木博士计划的事情呢？那个书呆子相信她找到了让你也能驾驶的方法。

"She said it would be about a week or so before she might be able to show me whatever she's working on," Shinji corrected her, before recoiling as Asuka aimed a slap at his head.
"她说大概要一周左右才能给我展示她在研究的东西，" 真嗣纠正她，随即因为明日香朝他头部挥来的巴掌而退缩。

"It's been three days, you impatient pessimist! Misato hasn't even finished with her paperwork yet!" Asuka groaned and turned to head back to the kitchen. "Just give it some time, for the sake of my sanity if nothing else."
才过了三天，你这没耐心的悲观主义者！连美里都还没处理完她的文书工作呢！" 明日香呻吟着，转身朝厨房走去。"就当是为了我的理智，再等等吧。

"Alright, alright," Shinji relented as he followed after her. "Can I at least help with breakfast? I don't need tastebuds to cut things up."
好吧，好吧，" 真嗣妥协地跟在她后面。"我至少能帮忙做早餐吧？我不需要味觉也能切东西。

"Sure. Er..." Asuka glanced at the oven, where something was apparently already cooking. A saucepan was sitting on the stove, but Shinji couldn't see what was in it. "Well... tomorrow we can start doing that together. I need to get you up to speed on what I plan to cook."
当然可以。呃..." 明日香瞥了一眼烤箱，显然里面已经在烤着什么了。一个平底锅放在炉子上，但真嗣看不清里面是什么。"嗯...明天我们可以一起开始做。我得让你跟上我打算做的菜。

"What are we having today?"
今天我们吃什么？

"I've got some rolls in the oven that will be done in a few minutes," replied Asuka. "Been a little while since I last made any though, so I hope I got them right."
烤箱里有几个面包卷，几分钟就好了，" 明日香回答道。"虽然我有一阵子没做了，希望这次做得对。

Shinji brightened up. "Oh, I remember you telling me about that a few years ago!" One of their online conversations had revolved around their favourite homemade foods. "You said that you... um, what was it... loved waking your mouth up with a strawberry jam roll?"
真嗣眼前一亮，“哦，我记得你几年前跟我提过这事！”他们的一次网络聊天就围绕着各自喜欢的自制美食展开。“你说过你...呃，是什么来着...喜欢用草莓酱卷唤醒味蕾？”

"Good memory," Asuka said with an approving nod. The oven dinged and she turned her attention to it, but not before waving a hand at the dining table, which had juice, butter, and a few jars of spreads sitting in the centre. "Take a seat. The rolls need to rest a little first, but there's boiled eggs if you want something while you wait."
“记性不错嘛，”明日香点头赞许道。这时烤箱发出叮的一声，她转而关注烤箱，但在此之前，她挥手示意餐桌，桌上中央摆着果汁、黄油和几罐果酱。“坐吧。面包卷得先放一会儿，不过你要是饿了，可以先吃煮鸡蛋。”

"Uh... yeah, sure." Shinji sat down opposite the stove and poured himself a glass of juice.
“呃...好的，当然。”真嗣坐在炉子对面的位置，给自己倒了杯果汁。

After turning off the oven, Asuka carefully removed two eggs from the saucepan and put them in a small bowl that she placed in front of Shinji. "What about you, Wondergirl?"
关掉烤箱后，明日香小心翼翼地从锅子里取出两个鸡蛋，放进一个小碗里，摆在真嗣面前。“你呢，奇迹女孩？”

"No thank you," Rei replied as she next to Shinji. "I do not eat eggs."
不用了，谢谢。" 绫波丽坐在真嗣旁边说道，"我不吃鸡蛋。

"Fair enough." 好吧。

The oven door opened, and a heavenly aroma billowed out. Shinji forgot all about peeling the egg in his hands, and even the normally-stoic Rei was paying close attention as Asuka took the tray of rolls out and placed it on the counter. She caught them staring and grinned, then picked one up and held it next to her ear as she lightly tapped its base.
烤箱门一开，一股诱人的香气扑面而来。真嗣手里剥着的鸡蛋都忘了，就连平时冷静的绫波丽也全神贯注地看着明日香把一盘面包卷拿出来放在台面上。她发现他们在盯着看，便咧嘴一笑，拿起一个面包卷，轻轻敲了敲底部，贴在耳边。

"They seem pretty damn good," Asuka remarked. "As to be expected of course. Baking is a science, and I am a college graduate."
看起来相当不错嘛，" 明日香评价道，"当然，这是意料之中的。烘焙是门科学，而我可是大学毕业生。

Shinji gave a good-natured roll of his eyes as he resumed peeling his egg. Once it was completely devoid of shell, he took a knife and cut the egg in half lengthways, popping one piece into his mouth as he worked on the second egg. By the time both eggs and half of his glass of juice were gone, Asuka declared the rolls ready and set out two for each of them; the remainder being put aside for Misato.
真嗣好脾气地翻了个白眼，继续剥他的鸡蛋。待鸡蛋完全脱去壳后，他拿起刀将鸡蛋纵向切成两半，一边将其中一半送入口中，一边着手处理第二个鸡蛋。当两个鸡蛋和半杯果汁下肚时，明日香宣布面包卷已烤好，并为每人摆上两个；余下的则留给了美里。

Shinji slathered some butter onto his first roll. It didn't seem worth using one of the sweet spreads when he wouldn't be able to enjoy it, but he needed something to make the bread go down easier. He really wished he could taste it; Asuka had clearly put a lot of effort into baking bread when she could have just bought some. With a sigh, he tore a chunk off the roll with his teeth and began to chew.
真嗣在第一个面包卷上涂了些黄油。既然尝不出味道，用甜酱似乎也没什么意义，但他需要些东西让面包更容易下咽。他真心希望能尝到味道；明日香本可以买现成的面包，却显然费了不少心思亲手烘焙。叹了口气，他撕下一块面包卷，用牙齿咬住开始咀嚼。

He froze. Something wasn't right. Shinji looked down at the roll in his hands as he slowly moved the piece of bread and butter around inside his mouth. It looked normal, and smelled great. He glanced up at Rei and Asuka, but they were occupied with their own rolls. He cautiously swallowed the mouthful, before biting off another piece.
他突然僵住了。感觉有些不对劲。真嗣低头看着手中的面包卷，缓缓地在嘴里移动着那块裹着黄油的面包片。面包看起来很正常，闻起来也很香。他抬头望向绫波和明日香，她们正忙着吃自己的面包卷。他小心翼翼地咽下口中的食物，然后又咬了一口。

The roll fell from his hand as realisation set in. Across from him, Asuka was about to start on her own roll when she obviously saw the strange look on his face.
面包从他手中滑落，意识到发生了什么。对面，明日香正要开始吃自己的面包，显然看到了他脸上的异样表情。

"Something wrong, Shinji?" she asked, lowering the roll back to her plate.
"怎么了，真嗣？" 她问道，将面包放回盘子里。

"I..." he began, before attempting to swallow.
"我……" 他刚开口，便试图吞咽。

"Shit, did a foreign object get into the mix?" Asuka cut in before he could continue. She was starting to get nervous, and started to rise from her chair. "Is it stuck in your throat? Can you breathe?!"
该死，是不是混进了什么异物？" 明日香打断他，开始紧张起来，从椅子上站起身。"卡在喉咙里了吗？你能呼吸吗？！

Rei's eyes shot towards him and she put her roll down. Just as she was about to stand up, Shinji frantically waved her back down as he finally managed to get the words out.
绫波的目光猛地投向他，放下手中的面包卷。正当她准备起身时，真嗣慌忙挥手示意她坐下，终于艰难地吐出了话语。

"I can taste it!" 我尝到味道了！

Rei and Asuka stared at him as if he had just grown a second head. After a moment, Asuka narrowed her eyes.
绫波和明日香盯着他，仿佛他突然长出了第二个脑袋。片刻后，明日香眯起了眼睛。

"You're just trying to butter me up, aren't you?" she growled. Some distant part of Shinji's mind wondered if the pun was intentional. "Or were you just lying about not being able to taste anything?!"
你这是在讨好我吧，是不是？"她咆哮道。真嗣脑海中某个遥远的地方不禁怀疑这个双关语是否故意的。"还是说，你之前根本就是在撒谎，其实你能尝出味道来？！

"N-no! I'm serious!" Shinji hurriedly replied. "I can actually taste the bread!" He paused and frowned at the roll. "I... don't seem to be able to taste the butter though..."
不，不！我是认真的！" 真嗣急忙回答，"我真的能尝到面包的味道！" 他停顿了一下，皱着眉头看着那块面包卷，"我...似乎尝不出黄油的味道...

Asuka stared for a few more seconds, before grabbing Shinji's knife and dipping it in one of the jam jars. As he was about to ask what she was doing, Asuka held the knife out in front of his face. Realising what she was trying to do, Shinji took the knife and licked it clean. He then shook his head. "No, can't taste that," he said before licking his roll. "But I can definitely taste this."
明日香又盯了几秒钟，然后抓起真嗣的刀，蘸了蘸其中一个果酱罐。就在他准备问她在做什么时，明日香把刀伸到他面前。意识到她的意图后，真嗣接过刀，舔干净了。然后他摇了摇头，"不，尝不出那个，"他说完又舔了舔面包卷，"但我确实能尝到这个。"

"That makes no sense at all," said Rei. "Bread itself has little actual flavour compared to these spreads."
这完全说不通，" 绫波说，"面包本身的味道远不如这些涂抹酱丰富。

"Yeah, you're starting to scare me now, Shinji," Asuka remarked, leaning slightly away from him with an odd look on her face.
"是啊，你现在开始让我害怕了，真嗣，" 明日香评论道，她微微后仰，脸上带着奇怪的表情。

"You?!" Shinji exclaimed. "I'm scaring myself!"
你?!" 真嗣惊呼道，"我都快把自己吓到了！

Asuka put a hand to her forehead. "Okay, okay... let's sort this out. Good thing it's Sunday..."
明日香用手扶着额头，"好吧，好吧...我们来理一理。幸好今天是周日..."

Several hours passed as Asuka 'administered tests' on Shinji's tastebuds. Uncooked items like fruit and snack foods were a bust, as was anything Rei prepared when Asuka brought her into it, along with anything Shinji made himself. A pattern quickly emerged: whatever Asuka made, whether it was cooking meat or preparing porridge, Shinji could taste.
几个小时过去了，明日香对真嗣的味觉进行了所谓的"测试"。像水果和零食这样的生食都失败了，当明日香拉来绫波丽一起尝试时，绫波丽准备的食物以及真嗣自己做的任何东西也都无济于事。很快，一个模式浮现出来：只要是明日香做的，无论是烹饪肉类还是准备粥，真嗣都能尝到味道。

"Are you still going to claim this isn't related to the contract, Shinji?" she asked in a gloating tone a couple hours after what would normally have been lunch time. She fell backwards onto the sofa in the lounge room. "I seem to remember wondering that after your dumb stunt with Misato's curry."
你还要坚持说这与契约无关吗，真嗣？" 几个小时后，通常的午餐时间已过，她带着得意的语气问道。她向后一倒，瘫坐在客厅的沙发上。"我记得在你那次愚蠢的咖喱事件后，我就曾怀疑过这一点。

Shinji scowled as he sat down next to her. "Still doesn't make any sense," he muttered.
真嗣皱着眉头坐到她旁边，嘟囔道：“还是觉得说不通。”

"I still find it hard to believe that this contract had any effect," said Rei, not looking up from the book she was reading on the sofa chair.
“我还是难以相信这份合同能起什么作用，”绫波丽说，她没有从沙发椅上正在阅读的书本上抬头。

"Yeah, logic is well and truly out the window at this point," added Asuka. "Hell, just look at what we do for a living."
“是啊，逻辑早就飞到九霄云外了，”明日香补充道，“天哪，看看我们这行当都干了些什么。”

Shinji sighed and shifted on the sofa. There had been quite a lot of food used for the tests, even split among three people. He wasn't sure he'd have room for dinner now. "I guess our stomachs are in your hands now, Asuka."
真嗣叹了口气，在沙发上挪了挪身子。测试中消耗的食物相当多，即使三个人分摊也如此。他不确定自己现在是否还有胃口吃晚饭。“看来我们的胃现在都交给你了，明日香。”

A week passed. Asuka got up at the same time as Shinji to prepare breakfast for the two households, as well as lunch on school days. She mostly stuck to German or at least Western meals, generally reserving Japanese-style dishes for dinner. There were no complaints about the change in menu. Then again, Shinji was just glad he was able to taste something again, which of course meant that his appetite improved.
一周过去了。明日香和真嗣同时起床，为两家人准备早餐，以及上学日的午餐。她大多坚持做德国菜，或者至少是西餐，通常将日式料理留到晚餐。对于菜单的变化，没有人提出异议。再说，真嗣只是很高兴能再次品尝到食物，这当然意味着他的食欲有所改善。

Every second day saw all three pilots at NERV for simulation training and sync tests. In the interest of fairness, AT-Fields were forbidden any time they trained against each other. During simulations against Angels, Asuka tended to take a forward position with a melee weapon while Shinji kept back providing ranged support, and Rei alternated between medium and long range support.
每隔一天，三位驾驶员都会在 NERV 进行模拟训练和同步测试。为了公平起见，他们在相互训练时禁止使用 AT 力场。在与使徒的模拟战斗中，明日香通常手持近战武器冲锋在前，真嗣则保持距离提供远程支援，而绫波则交替进行中远程支援。

On one day when Asuka complained that the training was too easy, Misato devised a sneaky challenge that Ritsuko was happy to implement. They would have to fight one of the bipedal training Angels, but the target could only be killed by Shinji in Unit-01 by destroying the core with a Progressive Knife. The other two Evangelions were not given weapons capable of killing the Angel, only damaging it. Ritsuko had wanted to use the Third Angel as a target, but Misato managed to convince her that Shinji would be negatively impacted by having to face the thing that had almost killed him under such conditions.
某日，当明日香抱怨训练过于轻松时，美里设计了一个狡猾的挑战，律子乐意执行。他们必须对抗一个双足训练型使徒，但目标只能由真嗣在初号机中用高振动粒子刀破坏核心来击杀。其他两台 EVA 未配备能杀死使徒的武器，仅能造成伤害。律子本想用第三使徒作为目标，但美里说服了她，认为在这种条件下让真嗣面对曾几乎置他于死地的存在会对他产生负面影响。

Neither of them told the pilots about the limitation. The Angel was eventually killed, but only after three attempts and only once Asuka and Rei worked out that they needed to cover Shinji so that he could get in and stab the core.
两人都未向驾驶员透露这一限制。使徒最终被消灭，但历经三次尝试，且直到明日香和绫波意识到她们需要掩护真嗣，让他得以接近并刺穿核心。

Asuka stopped complaining about easy training. At least where NERV could hear her.
明日香不再抱怨训练简单，至少在 NERV 能听到的范围内如此。

It was on this day that Rei was called into Commander Ikari's office after she had finished getting changed. When she entered the office, the elder Ikari was not sitting at his desk. Instead, he was standing in front of the massive window that looked out onto the Geofront, hands clasped behind his back.
就在这一天，绫波在换好衣服后被召到了碇司令的办公室。当她走进办公室时，年长的碇并没有坐在桌前，而是站在那扇巨大的窗前，俯瞰着地下的 Geofront，双手背在身后。

"Rei," he said without turning around, clearly knowing exactly who had just entered his office. "Have there been any problems since you changed residence?"
“绫波，”他没有转身，显然清楚地知道是谁刚刚进入了他的办公室，“自从你搬家以来，有没有遇到什么问题？”

"No problems to report," Rei replied monotonously, stopping next to his desk. "Pilots Ikari and Soryu and Captain Katsuragi have done their best to accommodate me."
“没有问题报告，”绫波单调地回答，停在他的办公桌旁，“碇驾驶员和惣流驾驶员以及葛城上尉已经尽力照顾我了。”

"Hrm." Gendo remained silent for a while, staring through the window. Eventually, he said, "Section Two reported that you acted strangely upon first meeting the other pilots at school. You noticed something about them." It was not a question.
“嗯。”碇元渡沉默了一会儿，透过窗户凝视着。最终，他说道：“第二部门报告说，你在学校初次见到其他驾驶员时表现得很奇怪。你注意到了他们身上的某些东西。”这不是一个疑问句。

Though he couldn't see her, Rei nodded. "Yes. Pilot Ikari had no light, while Pilot Soryu had more than any human I have ever seen. It was... painful to look at her at first, but I am now acclimatised to it. But to look at Pilot Ikari, it is similar to-"
尽管看不见她，绫波还是点了点头。“是的。碇真嗣没有光，而惣流·明日香·兰格雷的光芒比我见过的任何人都多。起初看着她很痛苦，但现在我已经适应了。但看着碇真嗣，感觉就像——”

Gendo interrupted her. "So you can confirm that this... soul contract the Third Child claims to have signed has transferred his soul."
碇源堂打断了她。“那么你能确认这个……第三适格者声称签订的灵魂契约已经转移了他的灵魂。”

"It is illogical that such a thing could have happened, but I do not know of any method by which a soul could change hands. Even she cannot do such a thing."
“这种事情发生是不合逻辑的，但我不知道有什么方法可以让灵魂易手。即便是她也无法做到这样的事。”

Gendo hummed again. "Keep an eye on them. If anything about the Second and Third Children changes that may be related, tell me immediately."
碇源堂再次哼了一声。“继续监视他们。如果第二和第三适格者有任何可能相关的变化，立即告诉我。”

"Yes sir." Rei thought for a moment. "Sir?"
是的，长官。" 绫波沉思片刻，"长官？

"What is it?" 什么事？

"Eight days ago, Pilot Soryu informed me that Pilot Ikari claimed to have lost his sense of taste."
八天前，明日香告诉我，碇真嗣声称自己失去了味觉。

Gendo seemed unfazed by the information. "Could he have suffered an injury that NERV was not informed about?"
碇源堂对此消息似乎不为所动。"他是否可能受了伤，而 NERV 未曾得知？"

"He did not appear to be injured, but he apparently began to lose it some time ago. Pilot Soryu believed that it may be related to the contract, but Pilot Ikari did not. However, seven days ago Pilot Ikari was able to taste a bread roll that Pilot Soryu had made. Further testing showed that he was only able to taste something that she had cooked."
他看似并未受伤，但显然早些时候就开始失常了。驾驶员惣流认为这可能与契约有关，而驾驶员碇则不以为然。然而，七天前，碇驾驶员尝到了惣流制作的面包卷。进一步测试显示，他只能品尝到她亲手烹饪的食物。

Gendo turned to look at Rei over his shoulder for several long seconds. "...Strange." He turned fully around, and slowly walked back to his desk. "Do you have everything you need at your current residence?"
源渡转过头，用几秒钟的时间凝视着身后的绫波。"...奇怪。" 他完全转过身，缓缓走回自己的办公桌。"你目前的住处一切所需都齐备吗？"

Rei shook her head. "No sir. I will soon require more medication. I currently have only enough for three more days, as the rest of my prescription was lost when my apartment was destroyed."
绫波摇了摇头。"不，先生。我很快就需要更多的药物。目前我手头的药只够维持三天，因为我的公寓被毁时，剩余的处方药都丢失了。"

"Speak to Doctor Akagi before you go home," said Gendo as he sat down. "She will give you more. It is vitally important that you do not miss a dose."
回家前去找赤木医生谈谈，" 源渡坐下时说道。"她会给你更多的药。至关重要的是，你不能漏服任何一次剂量。

"Understood, sir." 明白了，先生。

"Anything else?" 还有其他事吗？

"Pilot Soryu has already taken me to acquire essential clothing and personal items," said Rei, remembering the shopping trip. "There is nothing else I need at this time."
明日香已经带我去购置了必需的衣物和个人用品，" 绫波回忆着那次购物之旅说道，"目前我没有什么其他需要了。

"It is clear that you have started to develop a friendship with the other two pilots." Gendo fixed Rei with an intense stare. "Will you still do what is necessary when the time comes?"
显然，你已经开始与其他两位驾驶员建立起友谊了。" 源堂用锐利的目光盯着绫波，"关键时刻，你还会履行你的职责吗？

Rei answered immediately. "My ultimate fate has not changed. I will play my part without fail."
绫波立刻回答道：“我的最终命运并未改变。我将尽职尽责，扮演好我的角色。”

Gendo closed his eyes for a moment. "Good. Dismissed."
源渡闭眼片刻，“好。你可以走了。”

Rei bowed and left the office. As the door closed behind her, she wondered what it was she had seen in the commander's eyes when he learned of the oddities surrounding Shinji's sense of taste. It certainly wasn't concern; he rarely looked at her like that even when she was injured. Rather, it seemed as if he...
绫波鞠了一躬，离开了办公室。当门在她身后关上时，她思索着在指挥官得知围绕真嗣味觉的异常情况时，她在他眼中看到了什么。那绝不是关心；即使在她受伤时，他也极少那样看她。相反，他似乎……

She shook her head, banishing the unnecessary thoughts. It was not her place to question Commander Ikari. Her task was to defeat the Angels, then pave the way for Human Complementation.
她摇了摇头，驱散了这些不必要的思绪。质疑碇司令不是她的职责。她的任务是击败使徒，然后为人类补完计划铺平道路。

And then her pain would finally end.
然后她的痛苦终将结束。

Two girls stomped through the halls of Tokyo-3 Municipal High School, students with self-preservation instincts hastily clearing a path as they saw the look on their faces. A couple of boys saw that one of them was holding a certain something in her hand, put two and two together, and pretended to be extremely interested in anything but the angry girls.
两个女孩在东京第三市立高中的走廊里大步走着，学生们看到她们脸上的表情，本能地迅速让开一条路。几个男生注意到其中一个女孩手里拿着某样东西，心领神会，便装作对其他任何事物都极为感兴趣，唯独对那两个愤怒的女孩视而不见。

Asuka had just discovered that something... unsavoury was circulating around the school, and she was currently on her way to cut it off at the source. Hikari was tagging along both to ensure that nobody was permanently injured, and because she had a bone to pick with a certain someone.
明日香刚刚发现学校里流传着一些不体面的东西，她正赶往源头去切断它。而光则是跟在旁边，既是为了确保没有人受到永久性伤害，也是因为她对某个人有些不满。

The double doors leading outside were practically kicked open by Asuka as the two girls stepped outside. Asuka paused for a moment, looking around the quadrangle, before Hikari pointed out something in a shady spot between two buildings.
通往户外的双开门几乎是被明日香一脚踢开的，两个女孩走了出去。明日香停顿了一下，环视着四方院，这时光指向了两栋楼之间一个阴暗的角落。

A dark-haired teenage boy was sitting on a milk crate, leaning against the wall with a cap covering most of his face. He didn't look up as Asuka approached, and merely frowned as she slapped the item she was holding onto the table next to a folder.
一个黑发少年坐在牛奶箱上，背靠着墙，帽子遮住了大半张脸。当明日香走近时，他并没有抬头，只是在她将手中的物品拍在旁边的文件夹旁时皱了皱眉。

"No refunds," he grunted. "We are not responsible if somebody finds what you bought from us. Please direct all complaints somewhere else. And no, you can't see the boss, he's busy."
“概不退款，”他嘟囔道，“如果有人找到了你从我们这里买的东西，我们不负责任。请将所有投诉指向别处。还有，你不能见老板，他正忙着呢。”

"In this case, I'm going to have to insist on seeing him," said Asuka, as she raised her fists. "And I have two very convincing reasons why."
“在这种情况下，我必须坚持见他，”明日香说着，举起了拳头，“而且我有两个非常令人信服的理由。”

The boy blinked at her words, before pushing his cap up and looking at her. "Oh... shit," he muttered, before realising Hikari was there too. "Oh, shit."
少年听了她的话眨了眨眼，然后推起帽子看着她。“哦……糟糕，”他低声说道，随后意识到光也在场，“哦，糟糕。”

"Suzuhara!" Hikari barked. "Would you like to explain how you're involved in such a degenerate enterprise?"
Suzuhara!" 光厉声道，"你能解释一下你是如何卷入这种堕落勾当的吗？

"I'm mostly in this to watch Ken's back," Toji sullenly replied, looking like he wanted nothing more than to be somewhere completely different. "He's been threatened by some of the third year guys."
我主要是为了保护 Ken 才参与进来的，" 图吉闷闷不乐地回答，看起来他只想置身于完全不同的地方。"他受到了一些三年级男生的威胁。

"Gee, I wonder why that could be," Asuka snarked, before turning over the item on the table. It was a photo of herself in her school swimsuit. "Could it have anything to do with the fact that you're sneaking photos of their sisters and selling them?!"
哎呀，我想知道为什么会有这种事，" 明日香讽刺地说，然后翻看桌上的物品。那是一张她穿着学校泳装的照片。"这会不会和你偷拍他们妹妹的照片并出售有关呢？！

Toji glanced at the photo on the table, then back up at her. "Look Red, I'm just the muscle. I'm, uh... not exactly a fan of this idea."
图吉瞥了一眼桌上的照片，又抬头看向她。"听着，红发妞，我只是个打手。我，呃... 其实并不太赞成这个主意。"

Asuka snatched the folder from the table and brought it over to Hikari. Opening it, she was almost impressed at just how many photos there were, until she saw five whole pages dedicated to her. What really surprised her was that only one page had photos of her in her swimsuit. The other four were of seemingly random times when she was in her uniform.
明日香从桌上抓起文件夹，递给了光。打开一看，她几乎要佩服里面照片的数量之多，直到她发现整整五页都是关于她的。真正让她惊讶的是，只有一页是她在泳装的照片，而其他四页则是她穿着校服的看似随机的时刻。

How the hell had that nerd managed this?!
那个书呆子到底是怎么做到的？！

"Tell me, Hikari," she said as she continued to leaf through the folder, trying to work out just where the spectacled nerd had been hiding in order to get all these shots of her. "How many people do you think would be... unhappy with these two if we showed them this folder? I reckon we should tell them all at once. See how well the 'muscle' stands up to a dozen irate brothers."
“告诉我，光，”她一边翻阅文件夹，一边试图弄清楚那个戴眼镜的书呆子究竟躲在哪里才能拍到她这么多照片。“你觉得如果我们把这些给那两个人看，会有多少人感到不高兴？我觉得我们应该一次性告诉所有人。看看‘肌肉’面对十几个愤怒的兄弟时能撑多久。”

Hikari scowled at the contents of the folder. "Disgusting," she spat as she turned her attention to Toji. "You're disrespecting every single girl at this school by being part of this, Suzuhara, and dishonouring yourself! I thought better of you!"
光皱着眉头看着文件夹里的内容。“真恶心，”她一边说，一边将目光转向了东治。“东治，你参与这种事，是对这所学校每一个女生的不尊重，也是对自己的侮辱！我对你期望更高！”

A tap on the class representative's shoulder from Asuka drew her attention back to the folder. Whatever else Hikari was about to say died in her throat, and her face turned bright red. She snatched the folder from Asuka and pulled out the photo that had caught her eye. After a few seconds of staring horrified at it, she then dropped the folder and proceeded to frantically tear the photo up.
明日香轻拍了下班长后背，让她重新将注意力转回到文件夹上。光里原本要说的话卡在了喉咙里，脸颊瞬间涨得通红。她一把从明日香手中夺过文件夹，抽出了那张吸引她目光的照片。惊恐地盯着看了几秒后，她扔下文件夹，开始疯狂地将照片撕碎。

Toji raised an eyebrow. "What, was that your sister or somethin'?"
东治挑了挑眉，"怎么，那是你妹妹还是啥的？"

"Nope," said Asuka, tilting her head towards Hikari. "It was her."
不是哦，"明日香说着，把头偏向光里，"是她本人。

"What?!" Toji angrily got to his feet. "That's a lie! I looked through that folder ten minutes ago and didn't see her! N-not that I was actually l-lookin' for her, ya know?"
什么？！"东治怒气冲冲地站了起来，"那不可能！我十分钟前才翻过那个文件夹，根本没看到她！我-我可不是特意在找她，你知道的吧？

"You're blind then," Asuka retorted. She placed the folder onto the table and pointed at one of the sleeves. "I saw it sticking out a bit behind this one."
那你可真是瞎了眼，"明日香反驳道。她将文件夹放到桌上，指着其中一个文件套说："我看到它从这后面稍微露出来了一点。

The affronted boy stared suspiciously at the offending sleeve. "There's two more then. Ken always makes sure there's three of each."
被冒犯的男孩怀疑地盯着那个惹事的文件套。"那还有两张。健总是确保每种都有三张。"

A moment of searching revealed the other two photos, similarly hidden on the same page. They were swiftly grabbed by a red-faced Hikari and shredded, the pieces going into her pocket to be disposed of later. Possibly by fire.
经过一番搜寻，另外两张照片也被发现了，同样隐藏在同一页上。它们很快被满脸通红的光撕碎，碎片被塞进口袋，准备稍后处理。很可能是用火烧掉。

"So where's the body, bodyguard?" Asuka asked. She glanced at Hikari. "Wonder if Aida knew we were coming and ran off."
那么，保镖，尸体在哪里呢？"明日香问道，同时瞥了一眼光。"不知道洞木是否知道我们要来，所以逃跑了。

"He told me he was goin' to the bathroom," Toji replied. He then snarled and slammed a fist onto the table. "Damnit, I said I didn't want him to take photos of the class rep!"
他跟我说他去厕所了," 东治回答道。随后他咆哮一声，猛地一拳砸在桌上。"该死，我明明告诉他不要拍班长！

Asuka quirked an eyebrow. "Why so chivalrous? Why try and make him leave Hikari out of this?"
明日香挑了挑眉。"怎么这么有骑士精神？干嘛非要让他把光排除在外？"

"That was part of the deal. I watch Ken's back, he don't photograph the class rep." Toji suddenly looked shifty. "And... I get... a bit of the money he makes..." he mumbled, rubbing the back of his head.
"这是我们之间的约定。我帮健看着点，他就不拍班长。" 东治突然显得有些心虚。"然后... 我也能... 分到一点他赚的钱..." 他支支吾吾地说着，挠了挠后脑勺。

"So you're just helping someone take illicit photos of high school girls for pocket money, Suzuhara?" Hikari demanded.
"所以你只是在帮人偷拍高中女生，就为了赚点零花钱，东治？" 光质问道。

"S-sort of!" Toji stammered. "I-I mean... I'm savin' it for somethin' important!"
算是吧！" 东治结巴着说。"我...我的意思是...我留着它是为了什么重要的事！

"Oh really?" Asuka's voice dripped with false sweetness as she loomed over him. "What is this important thing? Tell us why it's alright to invade the privacy of these girls."
哦，真的吗？" 明日香的声音带着假意的甜腻，她俯视着他。"这个重要的事情是什么？告诉我们为什么可以侵犯这些女孩的隐私。

Toji glared up at her. "It's to help pay my little sis's hospital bills, Red," he icily replied.
东治抬头瞪着她。"是为了帮我妹妹付医药费，红毛，" 他冷冷地回答。

Asuka blinked. It certainly wasn't the response she was expecting.
明日香眨了眨眼。这绝对不是她预料中的回答。

"Don't think for one damn second that I'm proud of this," Toji grimly continued. "My sister might never walk again, because my family can't afford to pay for the surgeries that'd fix her up. Hell, the money's the only reason I agreed to... to this." He waved a hand disgustedly at the table in front of him.
"别以为我会为这事感到一丝一毫的骄傲，"东治阴沉地继续说道，"我妹妹可能永远都站不起来了，因为我家付不起那些能让她康复的手术费。该死，我之所以同意……同意这个，只是因为钱。"他厌恶地挥手示意面前的桌子。

Asuka swore internally. If Shinji heard about this he would likely slip back into self-deprecation. As it was she suspected he was still harbouring some guilt even after his confrontation with Suzuhara.
明日香暗自咒骂。如果真嗣知道了这件事，他很可能会再次陷入自我贬低的情绪。即便在与铃原对峙之后，她怀疑他仍怀有某种内疚。

"Toji..." Hikari's face softened slightly. "I understand you want to help your sister, but would she really want you to be doing this to get the money?"
东治……"光的脸色稍微柔和了一些，"我明白你想帮助你妹妹，但她真的希望你为了筹钱而做这些事吗？

As Toji shied away, something caught Asuka's eye; a person peeking around the corner then ducking back. She brushed past Hikari and moved up to the corner, where a quick glance showed a certain light-haired boy trying to quietly leave the area. She stalked up behind him, then wrapped an arm around his neck.
当东治退缩时，明日香的目光被某物吸引；一个人影在角落窥视后迅速缩回。她从光身边擦过，走向角落，快速一瞥发现一个淡发男孩正试图悄悄离开该区域。她悄悄跟在他身后，然后一把搂住他的脖子。

"Going somewhere, Aida?" 要去哪儿吗，Aida？

Without waiting for a reply, she dragged Kensuke over to Hikari, who was now giving him her signature 'class rep is very unhappy with you' look. Kensuke managed to stare back for about half a nanosecond before wilting.
不等回答，她便拽着健介来到光面前，此刻光正用她那标志性的“班长对你很不满意”的眼神盯着他。健介勉强回瞪了大约半秒钟，便败下阵来。

"I seem to recall catching you in a rather similar situation, Aida," said Hikari. "And I also seem to recall you saying that you'd give this up."
我记得似乎在类似的情况下逮到过你，Aida，"光说道，"而且我似乎还记得你说过会放弃这件事。

"He's done this before?" Asuka inquired, 'accidentally' constricting her arm around Aida's neck a little.
"他以前也干过这事？"明日香问道，"不小心"地收紧了环绕在 Aida 脖子上的手臂。

"Early last year," Hikari replied. "I caught him with his camera somewhere a boy shouldn't be. And... I abused my authority by not dragging him before the principal, on the condition that he destroy any and all photos he'd taken and promised to stop.
"去年初，" 光回答道，"我撞见他在不该去的地方拿着相机。然后...我滥用职权，没有把他拖到校长面前，条件是他必须销毁所有拍的照片，并承诺不再犯。

"Tell me, Aida." She stomped up to Kensuke, looking him right in the eyes from a foot away. "Am I a pushover?"
告诉我，相田。" 她大步走向健介，从一英尺的距离直视他的眼睛。"我看起来好欺负吗？

"Er... n-n-no?" Kensuke stammered, leaning away from Hikari's burning stare as best as he could while trapped in Asuka's grip.
"呃...不-不-不是吧？" 健介结结巴巴地说，尽量避开光那灼人的目光，尽管他被明日香紧紧抓住，动弹不得。

"Then why are you trying to walk all over me?!"
那你为什么还想骑到我头上来？！

Asuka let go of the poor bastard and stood back to let the haranguing continue, Toji getting dragged into it as well, with a satisfied smirk on her face. It went on for a good ten minutes before the end of lunch bell rang. Out of the goodness of Hikari's heart, she was once again not going to make it official, but she promised both boys that if she even heard a rumour of them continuing their shady activities, she would bring everything to the principal.
明日香放开了那个倒霉蛋，退后一步让训斥继续，东治也被卷了进来，而她脸上则挂着满意的笑容。这场训斥持续了足足十分钟，直到午休结束的铃声响起。出于光的心软，她这次依然不打算正式追究，但她警告两个男生，一旦听到有关他们继续从事不正当活动的风声，她就会将一切上报给校长。

As the two chastened boys scurried off, Hikari sighed and turned to Asuka. "Should I have really let them off with a second warning?"
两个被训斥的男生匆匆离开后，光叹了口气，转向明日香问道：“我真的应该再给他们一次警告吗？”

Asuka shrugged. "Suzuhara was only in it for cash for a noble cause, and he wasn't exactly as involved in the business as Aida was. I'd have probably let him off with a punch in the face. Aida though... well I won't get into detail on what I would have done to him, but a giant robot is involved. And not in a way he'd enjoy."
明日香耸了耸肩：“铃原参与这事只是为了筹钱做正经事，而且他并没有像相田那样深陷其中。我可能只会给他一巴掌就算了。至于相田嘛……关于我会怎么对付他，我就不细说了，但肯定涉及到一台巨型机器人，而且绝不是他会喜欢的那种方式。”

Hikari looked down at the folder that had been left behind. She picked it up by the thumb and forefinger. "How should we dispose of this?"
光低头看着被遗留下来的文件夹，用拇指和食指小心翼翼地拎起来，问道：“这东西我们该怎么处理？”

"Burn them, I say," Asuka said with a dismissive wave. "Certainly not worth keeping these kinds of photos."
烧掉它们，我说，" 明日香不屑地挥了挥手，"这种照片肯定不值得留着。

"Including the ones of you in uniform?" Hikari opened the folder to the relevant pages. "It's strange that his... customers," she spat the word, "were apparently asking for pictures of you like this. I'm not sure if it's illegal or not, but he was still being sneaky about it. Such a shame too... Aida has a very good eye for photography. If only his preferred subject matter wasn't so... dirty."
包括你穿制服的照片吗？" 光打开了相关的文件夹页。"奇怪的是，他的...顾客，" 她厌恶地吐出这个词，"显然要求这样的你的照片。我不确定这是否违法，但他确实偷偷摸摸的。真是可惜... 相田的摄影眼光很好。只是他偏爱的题材太...肮脏了。

Asuka almost said 'burn the lot', but a certain photo caught her eye. It was one of her and Shinji; the picture had been taken from somewhere on the right of him, keeping her centred in full view while they were walking somewhere. She was grinning at something he had just said, and though he was just slightly out of focus, Asuka could still see that Shinji had a smile on his face.
明日香几乎要说"全烧了"，但一张照片吸引了她的目光。那是她和真嗣的一张照片；照片是从他右侧的某个地方拍摄的，让她处于完全的中心视野，而他们正在某个地方走着。她正对着他刚说的话咧嘴笑，尽管他略微失焦，明日香仍能看到真嗣脸上带着微笑。

Something compelled her to take the sleeve containing the photo out of the folder. She held it up to her face for a moment until Hikari politely cleared her throat, bringing her back to the situation at hand.
某种力量驱使她从文件夹中取出装有那张照片的套子。她将它举到面前片刻，直到光礼貌地清了清嗓子，将她拉回到当前的情景中。

"Burn the lot," said Asuka as she dashed off to her locker in order to put the picture somewhere it wouldn't get lost.
"把这堆东西烧了，"明日香说着，飞奔向自己的储物柜，想把照片放在一个不会丢失的地方。

Or found. 或是被发现。

XXX

Shinji leaned against a tree, breathing heavily as sweat dripped down his face. When Asuka had offered to exercise with him, he had expected more of the slave driver mentality that had gotten him through the Evangelion simulations. To his surprise, the Second Child actually seemed to be going easy on him. Well, somewhat easy. He was still getting a strenuous workout, but against all expectations he was not crawling into bed at night wishing for death to release him from hell.
真嗣背靠一棵树，气喘吁吁，汗水顺着脸颊滴落。当明日香提出要和他一起锻炼时，他本以为会遭遇那种驱使他完成 EVA 模拟训练的严苛态度。出乎意料的是，第二适格者似乎真的在对他手下留情。嗯，算是留情吧。他仍在进行高强度的锻炼，但与预期相反，他并没有每晚爬上床时渴望死亡来解脱地狱般的煎熬。

"Couple minutes break and we'll get right back to it."
休息几分钟，我们马上继续。

Shinji jumped a little as Asuka suddenly spoke up right next to him. He glanced at her as she took a small sip from her water bottle. Suddenly thirsty himself, he wearily lifted his own to his lips and drank deeply.
真嗣被明日香突然在耳边响起的声音吓了一跳。他瞥了她一眼，只见她正从水瓶中小口啜饮。自己也突然感到口渴，他疲惫地举起自己的水瓶，大口喝了起来。

"Yeah, okay," he finally gasped. "Another week and I might actually be able to keep up with you."
嗯，好吧，"他终于喘着气说，"再过一周，我可能真的能跟上你了。

He swiped an arm across his forehead, rubbing the sweat off onto the wrist weight as he looked up through the leaves giving him a modicum of protection from the ever-present sun. When Toji had mentioned weights, Shinji had thought of small dumbbells. But then Asuka had rummaged around in her room and produced what looked like wide bracelets made of fabric.
他用手臂擦了擦额头，将汗水抹在手腕的负重带上，然后抬头透过树叶，那点微薄的遮蔽让他免受无时不在的阳光直射。当东治提到负重时，真嗣想到的是小哑铃。但随后明日香在她房间里翻找，拿出了一对看起来像宽布制手镯的东西。

"Body weights are good for exercising while you exercise," she had explained, wrapping one around Shinji's wrist. The surprising heaviness had made his arm feel... odd. "I've also got a weight vest, but I'll leave that for a while. Don't think you're ready to lug an extra ten kilos around just yet."
负重在锻炼时锻炼身体很有用，"她解释道，一边将一个负重带缠在真嗣的手腕上。那出乎意料的沉重让他的手臂感觉...很奇怪。"我还有一件负重背心，不过暂时先不给你。你还没准备好额外背负十公斤的重量。

A hand clapped heavily onto his shoulder. "You're doin' good, Shin-man!"
一只手重重地拍在他的肩上。"干得不错，真嗣！"

Jumping in surprise again as he was brought back to the present, Shinji looked left at a grinning Toji.
再次被吓了一跳，真嗣回过神来，向左一看，是咧嘴笑着的东治。

"To be perfectly honest," Toji continued, "I wasn't expectin' ya to do so well so soon!" He paled slightly as he made eye contact with Asuka over Shinji's shoulder.
"老实说，"东治接着说，"我没想到你这么快就能做得这么好！" 当他与真嗣身后的明日香对视时，脸色微微一白。

For some reason, Toji and Asuka had turned rather frosty towards one another over the last couple days. They were both still committed to seeing him get fit, but that seemed to be as far as their interactions with each other went. Shinji wasn't sure what had happened, and he wasn't about to get caught in the middle of... whatever it was.
不知为何，东治和明日香在过去几天里变得相当冷淡。他们仍然致力于帮助他锻炼身体，但似乎也就仅限于此了。真嗣不清楚发生了什么，也不打算卷入他们之间的...任何纠葛。

"Come on," said Toji. "Break's over, time to get going."
来吧，" 东治说道，"休息结束了，该继续前进了。

Shinji nodded, and brought up the rear as his two far more athletic friends took off on the return leg of their jogging route. As competitive as they were with each other, both of them knew to occasionally look back and see if Shinji was struggling. So far, he had managed to not be an inconvenience to them, but he still felt a little awkward every time Asuka or Toji glanced back and caught his eye. It was as if they were expecting him to be sprawled out on the ground.
真嗣点了点头，跟在两位运动能力远超自己的朋友后面，开始了他们跑步路线的回程。尽管他们之间竞争激烈，但两人都知道偶尔回头看看真嗣是否跟得上。到目前为止，他还没有成为他们的负担，但每当明日香或东治回头与他目光相遇时，他仍感到一丝尴尬。仿佛他们期待着他瘫倒在地。

But Shinji wasn't going to give them the satisfaction of being right. Well, if that was what they were thinking. Regardless, he was improving himself. As exhausted as he was every day, it was far better than sitting around doing nothing but listening to his SDAT.
但真嗣并不打算让他们如愿以偿。好吧，如果他们真是这么想的话。无论如何，他正在自我提升。尽管每天筋疲力尽，但这远比无所事事地坐着听他的 SDAT 要好得多。

They were halfway home when Shinji's phone rang. He pulled the phone out of his pocket and glanced at the number. Recognising it as a NERV line, and thankful for the excuse to rest, he slowed down to a walk as he flipped the phone open to take the call.
当他们走到半路时，真嗣的手机响了。他从口袋里掏出手机，瞥了一眼号码。认出是 NERV 的线路，庆幸有了休息的借口，他放慢脚步，边走边打开手机接听。

"Hello?" 你好？

"Hello, Shinji," said Misato. "How are you doing today?"
你好，真嗣，" 美里说道，"你今天怎么样？

Shinji quirked an eyebrow. It sounded like just a social call, but Misato never needed to call to catch up considering she lived right next door and saw them every day. "Uh, I'm fine... what about you?" he hazarded.
真嗣挑了挑眉毛。这听起来只是一次普通的社交问候，但考虑到美里就住在隔壁，每天都见面，她其实并不需要特意打电话来闲聊。"呃，我还好...你呢？" 他试探性地问道。

Misato must have caught the tiredness in his voice, however. "Jogging again, I take it? You sound out of breath."
美里似乎听出了他声音中的疲惫。"又去跑步了吧？你听起来气喘吁吁的。"

"Yeah. Toji, Asuka and I are on our way back now." Ahead, Shinji saw that the two in question had slowed down as well. To Asuka, he mouthed the words 'it's Misato' and she nodded in realisation.
"对，我和东治、明日香正在回去的路上。"前方，真嗣看到那两人也放慢了脚步。他对着明日香无声地说出“是美里”，她恍然大悟地点了点头。

"I'll get to the point," said Misato. "Do you think you'd be up for some unscheduled testing? Got a little surprise for you."
直说了吧，"美里道，"你们有没有兴趣进行一次计划外的测试？给你们准备了个小惊喜。

"Testing?" Shinji repeated. The word evidently caused Asuka to get curious, and she stopped for a moment to let Shinji catch up, positioning herself to try and eavesdrop on the conversation. Resisting the urge to roll his eyes at her inquisitiveness, Shinji pressed a button on the phone and changed it to speaker mode.
"测试？"真嗣重复道。这个词显然勾起了明日香的好奇心，她停下脚步，让真嗣赶上来，自己则凑近试图偷听对话。真嗣忍住翻白眼的冲动，按下手机上的按钮，切换到扬声器模式。

Misato hummed in acknowledgement. "I think it's something you'll really like, but it's going to take up quite a bit of time and energy. You up for it today or would you prefer to wait until tomorrow?"
美里嗯了一声表示听到了。"我觉得你们会很喜欢这个，但会耗费不少时间和精力。今天能行吗，还是想等到明天？"

"Make it tomorrow, Misato," Asuka cut in. "I can tell he's really tired. Whatever the test is, it'd be better if he's fresh for it."
改到明天吧，美里，"明日香插话道，"我能看出他真的很累。无论是什么测试，他精神饱满时参加会更好。

"Oh hello Asuka," greeted Misato. "I suppose you're right. Besides, you'll be needed there too, so you'd have to rest up as well."
哦，你好，明日香，"美里打招呼说，"我想你是对的。而且，你也需要在场，所以你也得好好休息一下。

"Me?" Asuka directed a look of confusion at Shinji, who could only shrug. "What the heck is this test anyway?"
我？"明日香困惑地看向真嗣，后者只能耸耸肩。"这到底是什么鬼测试啊？

"A surprise!" 一个惊喜！

Shinji groaned loudly, recalling the last time Misato had used that word to avoid telling him about Asuka coming to Japan.
真嗣大声呻吟着，回想起上次美里用那个词来避免告诉他明日香来日本的事情。

"I'll let Ritsuko know to prep for tomorrow," Misato continued. "No school for you two then, this test takes priority."
我会通知律子准备明天的测试，"美里继续说道，"你们俩明天不用去学校了，这次测试优先。

Above Toji's grumbling about the luck of pilots, Asuka said, "Could you please just freaking tell us what's going to happen? I would like to actually know what we're in for before it happens."
在东治抱怨飞行员运气的声音之上，明日香说："拜托，能不能直接告诉我们会发生什么？我想在事情发生之前就知道我们要面对什么。"

"Oh, alright you spoilsport." Though Shinji couldn't see the woman, he could certainly sense Misato sticking her tongue out at them. "The lab boys here have been building something. I'm not nerdy enough to be able to follow them, but I know enough to think that your wish might be about to come true, Shinji!
"哦，好吧，你这个扫兴的家伙。"虽然真嗣看不见那位女士，但他能明显感觉到美里在向他们吐舌头。"这里的实验室人员一直在制造一些东西。我不够书呆子，跟不上他们的思路，但我知道的足够多，认为你的愿望可能就要实现了，真嗣！

"If all goes well tomorrow, we'll have something that will let you get back into the fight against the Angels!"
如果明天一切顺利，我们将拥有让你重返对抗使徒战场的东西！

### Chapter 15 Begin The Test

Shinji was nervous. 真嗣感到紧张。

After getting home and eating dinner, he sat around in the lounge room wondering to himself just how NERV was going to be able to let him help Asuka and Rei, instead of focusing on his homework. Asuka was watching television, but Shinji paid even less attention to that.
回到家吃过晚饭后，他坐在客厅里，心里琢磨着 NERV 究竟会如何让他帮助明日香和零，而不是专注于自己的作业。明日香正在看电视，但真嗣对此更是心不在焉。

Asuka had earlier claimed that she had an idea, but wanted to keep it to herself in case she was wrong. Rei, on the other hand, had nothing to say on the matter before returning to Misato's apartment when it started getting late.
明日香之前声称她有个主意，但又想保密，以防自己错了。而零在傍晚时分回到美里公寓之前，对此事未置一词。

In the end, Shinji went to bed not knowing what to expect. When morning dragged itself around he felt just as confused as before upon waking up, with the added benefit of an odd dream he couldn't quite recall beyond remembering that he was piloting and somebody was talking to him.
最终，真嗣带着不知所措的心情上床睡觉。当早晨缓缓来临，他醒来时依旧感到困惑，再加上一个奇怪的梦，他只记得自己在驾驶，有人在跟他说话，但梦境的具体内容却记不清了。

After getting out of bed, having breakfast and getting ready, Asuka and Shinji were taken to the Geofront by Misato. Rather than heading straight for the Evangelions as Shinji expected, they were taken further into the depths of NERV. Fortunately, Misato at least knew where to go this time. As they went through a veritable maze of corridors, all Shinji could gather from their journey was that they were now somewhere in the 'Sigma Unit', which wasn't very helpful. Soon, they came to a halt in front of a door with a label that simply said...
起床、用完早餐并准备妥当后，明日香和真嗣被美里带到了 Geofront。与真嗣预想的不同，他们并没有直接前往 EVA，而是被带往 NERV 更深处。幸好，这次美里至少知道路。他们穿梭在迷宫般的走廊中，真嗣仅能从行程中得知他们现在位于“西格玛单元”，这信息并无太大帮助。不久，他们在一块标牌前停下，上面简单地写着...

"Pribnow Box?" Shinji wondered, looking curiously at the label then at Misato.
"普里布诺盒？"真嗣疑惑地看着标牌，又转向美里。

"Don't look at me, Ritsuko came up with the name." Misato shrugged. "All I know is that this place was only finished about a week ago, and it's where we're going to test the prototype."
别看我，这名字是律子起的。"美里耸了耸肩。"我只知道这个地方大约一周前才完工，我们将在这里测试原型机。

"Pribnow box is a DNA thing, something to do with RNA," Asuka distractedly replied. "Anyway, what's this prototype?"
普里布诺盒是关于 DNA 的，涉及到 RNA。"明日香心不在焉地回答。"那么，这个原型机是什么？

"See for yourself!" Misato pressed a button next to the door, and it slid open.
"你自己看吧！" 美里按下门旁的按钮，门便滑开了。

Inside was a large room, with a floor-to-ceiling window in place of a wall on the left and several control stations facing towards it. An open doorway opposite the one the group came in from led off to some unknown place. Doctor Akagi was already here, talking with Lieutenant Ibuki, and several technicians were evidently going over last minute details. Akagi and Ibuki looked up as Shinji and Asuka approached.
里面是一个宽敞的房间，左侧是一面直达天花板的窗户，几台控制台面向窗户排列。与他们进来的门相对的另一扇敞开的门通向某个未知的地方。赤木博士已经在这里，正与伊吹中尉交谈，几名技术人员显然在核对最后的细节。赤木和伊吹抬头看见真嗣和明日香走近。

"Good, you're here," said Akagi. She waved a hand towards the window. "You'll be working in there in a few minutes."
很好，你们来了，" 赤木说道，她挥手示意窗户那边，"几分钟后你们就要在里面工作了。

Shinji walked up to the window and looked through. In the rather small and narrow chamber on the other side, there was what appeared to be two entry plug pilot seats and control columns in close proximity to each other, with a multitude of cables running from them into the wall they sat against.
真嗣走到窗前，透过窗户望去。在对面那个狭小而狭窄的房间里，有两个看似插入栓驾驶座的座椅和控制杆紧密相邻，众多电缆从它们延伸至背后的墙壁。

"Is this going to be some kind of synchronisation test?" Shinji asked, looking back at Doctor Akagi.
"这是某种同步测试吗？" 真嗣回头问赤木博士。

She gave him an appraising look. "Some kind, yes. Now then, we've got a lot of work to do today, so hurry up and get into your plugsuits." She then pointed towards the open doorway. "There's a changing room through there, and the path to the test chamber is just beyond that."
她给了他一个评估的眼神。"某种程度上，是的。好了，今天我们有很多工作要做，快去换上你的插入栓服吧。" 她指向敞开的门口。"那里有个更衣室，测试室的通道就在那后面。"

Shinji nodded, and headed for the doorway. As he reached it, he almost bumped into a distracted-looking Asuka. She looked like she was about to say something, but then she shoved him ahead of her into the hallway. When they reached the changing room, that was when she chose to speak.
真嗣点头，朝门口走去。当他到达时，差点撞上心不在焉的明日香。她看起来像是要说什么，但随后她推着他先走进了走廊。当他们到达更衣室时，她才开口。

"I'm pretty sure I know what the plan is," she said as they split up to move to their respective sides of the privacy screen. A packaged blue and white plugsuit sat on a bench, waiting for him.
"我很确定我知道计划是什么，" 他们分开走向各自的隐私屏风时，她说道。一个包装好的蓝白色插入栓服放在长凳上，正等着他。

"Well at least one of us does," Shinji drily remarked. He tore the plastic wrapping off of his plugsuit and unfurled it. "I'm still in the dark."
至少我们中有一个明白，" 真嗣干巴巴地评论道。他撕开插入栓服的塑料包装，将其展开。"我还是一头雾水。

"Oh come on, figure it out," Asuka huffed. "You're not as dumb as you sometimes act."
哎呀，动动脑子吧，" 明日香不耐烦地说。"你没你有时候表现出来的那么笨。

Shinji directed a scowl at the privacy screen, but held his tongue as he began to undress.
真嗣朝隐私屏风投去一瞥不满的目光，但保持沉默，开始更衣。

While getting changed, he thought things over. Doctor Akagi had apparently found a way to let him safely pilot again, and the fight against the Angel in the ocean had supposedly contributed greatly to her research. He searched his memory, remembering how he and Asuka had managed to get Unit-02 to work underwater without the proper equipment by working together. And while it hadn't come up in the fight, Asuka had said beforehand that she could project an AT-Field to cover them since he couldn't.
换衣服时，他仔细思考着。赤木博士显然找到了让他安全再次驾驶的方法，而与海洋中的使徒战斗据说极大地促进了她的研究。他回忆起，自己和明日香是如何在没有适当设备的情况下，通过合作让二号机在水下运作的。尽管在战斗中没有提及，但明日香之前说过，她可以投射 AT 力场来保护他们，因为他做不到。

And then there was what Doctor Akagi had said afterwards on the deck of the Over the Rainbow.
接着就是阿卡吉医生后来在“彩虹之上”甲板上所说的话。

"We were... perfectly in sync with one another," Shinji quietly mumbled to himself.
“我们那时……完全同步了，”真嗣轻声自言自语道。

"I hear gears grinding over there!" Asuka called out. "Have you finally figured it out?"
“我听到那边有齿轮在转了！”明日香喊道，“你终于想明白了吗？”

"I think so," Shinji called back. "They're going to... test how well two pilots can pilot one Eva?"
“我想是的，”真嗣回应道，“他们要测试两个驾驶员如何共同驾驶一台 Eva？”

"Oh well done!" The sound of gloved hands clapping not-quite-sarcastically echoed through the small room. "That's exactly it. We did so well together against that fish when Unit-02 wasn't set up for it, they're going to see what we can do in a custom rig."
哦，干得好！"戴着手套的双手不太讽刺地鼓掌声在小房间里回荡。"就是这样。我们之前在二号机未准备好的情况下对抗那条鱼时表现得很出色，现在他们将看到我们在定制装备中的实力。

Shinji pressed the wrist button to seal his plugsuit. "One hundred and forty eight percent," he murmured. "How much better could we get?"
真嗣按下手腕上的按钮，密封了他的插入栓服。"百分之一百四十八，"他低声自语。"我们还能变得多强？"

"That's what we're about to find out!" said Asuka as she stuck her head around the privacy screen, hair trailing wildly behind her. "Let's not keep them waiting any longer!"
这就是我们即将要找出的答案！"明日香说着，从隐私屏风后探出头来，头发狂野地飘扬在身后。"别让他们等太久了！

The Second Child practically ran out of the room, causing Shinji to give a brief chuckle. It seemed like she was more interested in what the test could do for her rather than him. Following her down the hallway, Shinji soon came to the small chamber on the other side of the window. From this side he couldn't see in, but he sent a nervous wave that way.
二号适格者几乎是跑出了房间，这让真嗣不禁轻笑一声。她似乎更关心这次测试对她自己的意义，而非他。跟随她穿过走廊，真嗣很快来到了窗子另一侧的小室。从这边他看不见里面，但他还是紧张地向那边挥了挥手。

Akagi's voice suddenly came through a speaker. "First we'll be doing a quick test to ensure everything's working optimally, as well as establish a baseline. Go to your assigned plugs."
赤木的声音突然通过扬声器传来。"首先我们将进行一个快速测试，以确保一切运行最佳，并建立基准。请前往你们各自的插入栓。"

Looking back at the plug seats, Shinji saw that they were labelled '01' and '02'. Asuka was already getting settled in hers, so he hurried over to the other. A second after he sat down, something began beeping and LCL began to pour out of the ceiling. Shinji closed his eyes and held his breath as the liquid flowed over his head, then let the breath out and quickly sucked in a lungful of LCL, just as Asuka had taught him during his week of hell.
回头望向插入栓座位，真嗣看到它们标有'01'和'02'。明日香已经就位，于是他急忙走向另一个。刚一坐下，某种装置开始发出哔哔声，LCL 液体从天花板倾泻而下。真嗣闭上眼睛，屏住呼吸，任由液体漫过头顶，随后按照明日香在那个地狱般的一周里所教的，吐出气息，迅速吸入一口 LCL。

"The entry plugs are remotely connected to your Evas," said Akagi. "If everything goes well, this first part should be just like you're in a normal sync test. Tell us if you feel anything strange or wrong."
插入栓已远程连接到你们的 EVA 机体，"赤木说道，"如果一切顺利，这第一部分应该就像进行常规同步测试一样。如果有任何异常或不适，请告诉我们。

A minute later, Shinji felt the same sense of almost-vertigo he normally got when synchronisation with a seventy-five meter tall robot was successful. At the same time, holographic screens erupted in front of his face, giving him a view of the cage where his Evangelion was stored along with several data readouts. With a thought, he directed his view to look around, then gave a small shake of his head as if to loosen his muscles, and Unit-01's head mirrored his movement.
一分钟后，真嗣感受到了与往常同步成功时相同的近乎眩晕的感觉，那是一台七十五米高的机器人。与此同时，全息屏幕在他面前爆发，让他看到了存放他的福音战士的笼子以及几项数据读数。他只需一个念头，便能转动视线环顾四周，然后轻轻摇头，仿佛在放松肌肉，而零号机的头部也同步了他的动作。

"Everything's fine so far," he reported.
"目前一切正常。" 他报告道。

"Same here," added Asuka.
"我这边也一样。" 明日香补充说。

"Good." After ten minutes, Akagi reported the results of the sync test to them. "Preliminary results show fifty-two percent for Shinji, sixty-seven for Asuka. The same as your last sync test, so we know everything is as it should be."
很好。" 十分钟后，赤木向他们报告了同步测试的结果。"初步结果显示，真嗣的同步率为五十二，明日香为六十七。与你们上次的同步测试相同，这说明一切都在正常范围内。

The holographic screens shut off and the almost-vertigo sensation disappeared. Shinji let out a sigh of relief at the fact that the sync tests wouldn't be the standard who-knows-how-many hours long ordeals they usually were. The tests obviously wouldn't be as perfectly accurate, but Shinji didn't mind. He glanced left at Asuka, but she was still focused on where her screens had been.
全息屏幕关闭后，那种几乎令人晕眩的感觉也随之消失。真嗣松了一口气，庆幸同步测试不会像往常那样，动辄持续不知多少小时。虽然测试显然不会那么精确无误，但真嗣并不介意。他向左瞥了一眼明日香，但她仍专注于刚才屏幕所在的位置。

A minute passed before Akagi's voice came back into the room. "Just one more quick test, then we'll proceed."
过了一分钟，赤木的声音再次在房间内响起：“再做一个快速测试，然后我们就继续。”

Shinji frowned as the test commenced. This time there was a fleeting sensation of... reluctance accompanying the vertigo, and then the holographic screens returned. The frown deepened. Were his eyes playing tricks on him? The cage seemed slightly different now. He looked around, but couldn't see anything that could confirm it one way or the other. A few minutes later, just as he was about to let the matter slide, Asuka piped up.
测试开始时，真嗣皱起了眉头。这次伴随着晕眩感，有一种转瞬即逝的...抗拒感，随后全息屏幕再次出现。他的眉头皱得更深了。难道是自己的眼睛在捉弄自己？那个笼子现在看起来似乎有些不同。他环顾四周，却找不到任何能证实这一点的东西。几分钟后，正当他打算将这件事抛诸脑后时，明日香突然开口。

"Wait, why am I in Unit-01 now?!"
“等等，为什么我现在在初号机里了？！”

Shinji blinked, then looked 'down'. Sure enough, the torso now filling the bottom of his screens was red, not purple. "Oh, so I wasn't imagining things," he murmured.
真嗣眨了眨眼，然后低头看去。果然，屏幕下方映出的躯干现在是红色，而非紫色。“哦，看来我不是眼花了，”他低声自语。

"Yeah, all I had to do was look down to see some garish purple and green paint," said Asuka.
“是啊，我只要低头一看，就能看到那刺眼的紫绿涂装，”明日香说道。

"We weren't trying to hide anything from you," said Akagi. "But we figured that while we were down here we may as well give you two a quick test in each other's Evas."
“我们并不是有意瞒你，”赤木说，“只是觉得既然都在这儿了，不妨让你们俩互相快速试驾一下对方的 EVA。”

"What? Why?" asked Asuka, frowning at the window. "You already know I can pilot Unit-01 just fine."
“什么？为什么？”明日香皱着眉头望向窗口，“你们明明知道我驾驶零号机完全没问题。”

"Yes, but we weren't sure about Shinji's solo affinity for Unit-02," came the terse reply. "This will give us another data point to use in the later tests, as well as let us know if Shinji could pilot your Eva in an emergency."
是的，但我们对真嗣与二号机的单独适配性并不确定，"对方简短地回答道，"这将为我们后续测试提供另一个数据点，同时也能让我们了解真嗣在紧急情况下是否能驾驶你的 Eva。

"Oh. Right." Asuka looked sheepish for a moment. She turned her head to look at Shinji for a second, then back to the window. "So... how is he doing?"
哦，对。"明日香一时显得有些尴尬。她转头瞥了真嗣一眼，随即又望向窗外，"那么...他表现如何？

"Not surprisingly, worse than Unit-01. Still, he's hovering around thirty-five percent at the moment." The scientist almost sounded impressed. "Perhaps at a later date we'll do a full sync test with Shinji in Unit-02. If that's alright with you, Asuka?"
不出所料，比一号机差。不过，他目前同步率稳定在百分之三十五左右。"科学家几乎带着一丝赞赏的语气，"或许将来某个时候，我们会安排真嗣与二号机进行全面同步测试。你没意见吧，明日香？

Asuka apparently decided to ignore the sarcasm in the scientist's voice. "Sure. It is the Production Model after all. If Shinji couldn't pilot Unit-02, I'd be looking at what's wrong with your systems."
明日香显然决定忽略科学家话语中的讽刺意味。"当然可以。毕竟这是量产机型。如果真嗣驾驭不了二号机，我倒要看看是你们的系统出了什么问题。"

There was something that could almost have been a growl right as the speaker cut out.
就在说话者声音戛然而止的瞬间，似乎传来了一声低沉的咆哮。

"Please don't antagonise the person in charge of our tests, Asuka," pleaded Shinji. "She might decide to make us do it naked next time, or something."
请不要激怒负责我们测试的人，明日香，" 真嗣恳求道，"她可能会决定下次让我们裸体进行，或者更甚。

Asuka made a face, but didn't respond. Soon, Akagi's voice reached them once more.
明日香做了个鬼脸，但没有回应。不久，赤木的声音再次传到他们耳中。

"Alright, time for the big one. Hope you two are comfortable, because this is where things will start to take time. This is highly experimental and we don't yet know what could happen, so don't be afraid to speak up if anything at all feels wrong. Better safe than sorry. Now then, you're both going to synchronise with Unit-02 at the exact same time. Asuka, the system language will be set to Japanese. Data from your fight against the Sixth Angel showed that your sync ratio slipped a little whenever you had to communicate with us."
好了，现在是重头戏。希望你们俩都准备好了，因为接下来会耗费不少时间。这是高度实验性的，我们还不知道会发生什么，所以如果有什么不对劲，尽管说出来。宁可小心为上。那么，你们俩将同时与二号机同步。明日香，系统语言将设定为日语。你与第六使徒战斗的数据表明，每当需要与我们沟通时，你的同步率就会略有下降。

A groan came from Shinji's left. "Fine."
真嗣左边传来一声呻吟。"好吧。"

"Begin the test." 开始测试。

Vertigo. Reluctance. Confusion. But then... the reluctance faded, replaced by surprise and acceptance. The feeling lasted only a second, but Shinji hit his palm against the side of his head, trying to banish the strangeness so he could focus on the test.
眩晕、抗拒、困惑。但随后...抗拒感消退，取而代之的是惊讶与接受。这感觉仅持续了一秒，但真嗣猛地拍了拍自己的脑袋，试图驱散这股异样，以便专注于测试。

"Something wrong, Shinji?"
真嗣，有什么问题吗？

"It's nothing," he mumbled. "Just... thought I felt something."
没什么，" 他含糊地说，"只是... 觉得好像有什么东西。

"...Alright then." Akagi didn't sound convinced, but fortunately she let the matter slide. Shinji didn't know how to begin explaining the sensations, and now wasn't the time anyway.
"...那好吧。" 赤木听起来并不信服，但幸运的是她没有深究。真嗣不知道如何开始解释这些感觉，而且现在也不是时候。

The holographic screens flashed to life once more, showing Unit-02's cage. Shinji tried to look around, but the Evangelion's head wasn't obeying his mental command properly. It 'felt' stiff, and seemed to jerk occasionally as if fighting against him.
全息屏幕再次亮起，显示着二号机的笼子。真嗣试图环顾四周，但初号机的头部并没有正确响应他的思维指令。它'感觉'很僵硬，似乎偶尔会抽搐，仿佛在与他对抗。

And then Shinji remembered that this was a test with two people. The moment he gave up on turning the head it snapped to the right, giving him an excellent view of a wall.
然后真嗣记起这是两个人的测试。就在他放弃转动头部的那一刻，它突然向右一转，让他看到了一堵墙。

"Shinji, stop fighting me!" Asuka growled.
"真嗣，别跟我对着干！"明日香咆哮道。

Shinji glanced over to see that she was glaring at him. "S-sorry!" he stammered.
真嗣瞥了一眼，发现她正怒视着自己。"对……对不起！"他结巴着说。

"Settle down," said Akagi. "There's a hell of a lot of interference, which I expected. You two aren't acting together. Stop moving on your own for the moment; I'll give you some simple commands to follow."
冷静点，"赤木说道，"干扰很大，这我早有预料。你们俩没配合好。暂时别擅自行动，我会给你们一些简单的指令来执行。

Asuka huffed and turned her attention back to her set of screens, and Shinji followed suit. In Unit-02's cage, a light began flashing accompanied by an alert siren. Shinji took this to mean that the cage was now a no-go zone for personnel. Then one of the data screens in front of him changed, showing a silhouette of an Evangelion.
明日香哼了一声，将注意力转回自己的屏幕上，真嗣也照做。在二号机的笼子里，一盏灯开始闪烁，伴随着警报声响起。真嗣意识到这意味着笼子现在成了人员禁入区。随后，他面前的一个数据显示屏发生了变化，显示出一个使徒的轮廓。

"We've unlocked the arms on Unit-02. At the same time, both of you will do what the screen tells you to."
我们已经解开了二号机的手臂限制。与此同时，你们俩要按照屏幕上的指示行动。

A timer appeared under the silhouette, which now had its right arm raised. The timer began to count down from five seconds, and Shinji readied himself.
屏幕上的人影下方出现了一个计时器，此时人影的右臂已经抬起。计时器开始从五秒倒数，真嗣做好了准备。

At zero, he raised Unit-02's right arm. This time, there was no stiffness or jerkiness. The arm lifted smoothly out of the LCL and reached for the roof above.
当倒数归零时，他举起了二号机的右臂。这一次，没有僵硬或迟滞，手臂顺畅地从 LCL 液体中抬起，伸向了上方的屋顶。

"Very good. A massive improvement already," reported Akagi, with a note of approval.
"非常好。已经有了巨大的进步，"赤木报告道，语气中带着赞许。

"Way to go, you two!" came Misato's enthusiastic voice.
"干得好，你们俩！" 传来美里热情洋溢的声音。

For the next minute or so, Shinji and Asuka followed the instructions; raising an arm, lowering it, making a fist, and other simple gestures they could do while Unit-02 was in its cage.
接下来的几分钟里，真嗣和明日香按照指示行动；举起手臂，放下，握拳，以及其他在二号机处于机库时能做的简单动作。

"Excellent. I would almost consider sending you two out against an Angel now if one attacked," said Akagi.
"非常好。如果现在有使徒来袭，我几乎会考虑派你们俩出战了，" 赤木说道。

"Why don't we fight like this all the time?" Shinji inquired. "It'd definitely be safer for us to fight remotely."
为什么我们不一直这样战斗呢？" 真嗣问道。"远程作战对我们来说肯定更安全。

"You're only linked to Unit-02 through a hard line connection," replied Akagi. "The moment it left the cage you'd lose that link. And a wireless receiver wouldn't have the fidelity required for maintaining a good synchronisation."
你与二号机仅通过有线连接相连，"赤木回答道，"一旦它离开笼子，连接就会断开。而且无线接收器无法保证维持良好同步所需的保真度。

"Oh."

"Suits me just fine," Asuka airily remarked. "I like being close to the action."
正合我意，"明日香轻松地说，"我喜欢身处行动之中。

"And now it's time for what I'm sure you'll come to think of as the boring bit," said Akagi. "Time for a sync test."
现在到了我确信你们会觉得无聊的部分了，"赤木说，"同步测试时间到了。

Asuka groaned, her jovial mood suddenly gone.
明日香发出一声哀叹，她那愉悦的心情瞬间消失了。

"Stop complaining. You'll be going through some simulation battles afterwards, so you at least have something to look forward to."
别抱怨了。待会儿还有模拟战斗等着你们，至少有点盼头吧。

"Come on, don't you want to know what your official sync ratio is like this?" asked Misato. "I don't mind sitting around if it means getting to see what you two are capable of. Surely you can cope."
喂，你难道不想知道这次正式的同步率是多少吗？" 美里问道，"如果闲坐着能见识到你们俩的本事，我倒是不介意。你们肯定能应付得来。

"Yeah, yeah," said Shinji and Asuka simultaneously. They froze, glancing at each other in surprise.
"嗯，嗯，" 真嗣和明日香异口同声地说道。他们愣了一下，惊讶地互望一眼。

"See? You're working together better already!"
看吧？你们合作得越来越默契了！

As one, the two pilots scowled at the window.
两位飞行员同时皱眉望向窗外。

XXX

Unit-02 jumped over the hill like it was a hurdle, its massive feet crashing down on the other side and obliterating a house that happened to be in the way. By the time the first bits of debris hit the ground, the red Evangelion was already cresting another hill.
二号机如跨栏般跃过山丘，巨大的双脚重重落在另一侧，不幸挡道的房屋瞬间化为乌有。当第一批瓦砾落地时，红色福音战士已翻越至另一座山丘之巅。

Shinji was thankful that this was just a simulation; there was no need to fret over collateral damage. Of course he and Asuka had been asked to treat the exercise like a real attack and to try not to destroy everything in their path, but they wouldn't always be able to spare the time or thought to avoid civilian buildings. The Angels certainly wouldn't care.
真嗣庆幸这只是一场模拟；无需为附带损害忧心。当然，他和明日香被要求将训练视为实战，尽量避免摧毁沿途一切，但他们并非总能腾出时间和精力避开民用建筑。天使们显然不会在乎。

As if to prove that point, ahead of them the Third Angel fired a beam of light from its face as it emerged from the bay, shredding several buildings before gouging a hole in a mountain range. It then turned and fired another beam at the oncoming Unit-02. With a quick thought on Asuka's part, Unit-02 raised its AT-Field just in time to deflect the beam a dozen meters from its face.
仿佛为了印证这一点，前方的第三使徒从海湾中现身，面部射出一道光束，撕裂数栋建筑后在山脉上凿出一个大洞。随即转身，向迎面而来的二号机发射另一道光束。在明日香的迅捷反应下，二号机及时升起 AT 力场，将光束偏转至离面部仅十米之外。

This was now the second time they had fought the Third Angel, code-named Sachiel, having just recently slain the Fourth -Shamshel- as it approached Tokyo-3 from behind a mountain range. Fighting on uneven terrain had been tough at first, but the point of the exercise was to get Shinji and Asuka used to controlling the same Evangelion at the same time. It had taken them half an hour just to learn to move together at first, but soon they had zipped around Hakone like they were trying to break the land speed record.
这是他们第二次与第三使徒萨基尔交战，不久前才刚从山脉后接近第三新东京市的第四使徒夏姆榭尔已被他们击败。起初在不平坦的地形上作战颇为艰难，但训练的目的正是为了让真嗣和明日香习惯同时操控同一台福音战士。他们花了半小时才学会最初步的同步移动，但很快便在箱根地区穿梭自如，仿佛要打破陆地速度纪录一般。

The Fifth Angel, which had been given the name Ramiel, had been deemed too complex for the simulation in its original form. It had been replaced with an upgraded training Angel that came with a similarly powerful beam attack, but could not sustain it as long as the real thing. This had, eventually, allowed Unit-02 to get close and destroy it in melee combat.
第五使徒雷米尔因其复杂性被认为不适合以原始形态进行模拟训练。取而代之的是一个升级版的训练用使徒，它拥有同样强大的光束攻击能力，但持续时间不及真正的第五使徒。最终，这使得二号机得以接近并利用近战将其摧毁。

Shinji brushed an errant lock of hair behind his ear as he felt the weight of the power cable return to 'his' back the moment Unit-02 reached flat ground near the city. Since this was a simulation, it had been decided that time didn't need to be wasted on detaching and reattaching power cables as they moved around the simulated Tokyo-3 and its surroundings. It would only manifest itself during active combat, during which they would have to remember to protect it just like in real life. Once the target was eliminated, the cable would disappear again until Unit-02 reached the site of the next Angel incursion.
当二号机在城市附近到达平坦地面时，真嗣感觉到电源线再次回到了“他”的背上。由于这是模拟训练，决定不必在移动过程中浪费时间去拆卸和重新连接电源线，这只会体现在实战中，届时他们必须像现实中一样记得保护它。一旦目标被消灭，电源线就会再次消失，直到二号机抵达下一个使徒入侵地点。

Unit-02 put an armoured building between itself and Sachiel for a moment, where it drew the Pallet Rifle and readied it as another beam of light exploded against the other side of the building. Two seconds later, Unit-02 jumped out of cover and charged laterally towards Sachiel, firing the Pallet Rifle to force the Angel to deploy its AT-Field and rendering it unable to retaliate while they were in the open. A moment later Unit-02 reached the safety of another slab of armour and ejected the spent magazine, slapping a fresh one in before repeating the pattern a second time.
二号机将一座装甲建筑置于自身与雷天使之间，趁机抽出弹药分配器步枪并准备射击，与此同时，另一束光在建筑的另一侧爆炸。两秒后，二号机跃出掩体，横向冲向雷天使，用弹药分配器步枪射击，迫使使徒展开 AT 力场，使其在开阔地带无法反击。片刻后，二号机抵达另一块装甲板的掩护下，退出空弹匣，迅速装填新弹匣，然后再次重复这一模式。

It was somewhat disappointing how quickly Sachiel fell once it was forced into melee combat. The Angel attempted to spear the Evangelion with its energy lance but Unit-02 almost lazily swatted the arm away, before dropping it to the ground with a leg sweep and shoving a Progressive Knife into its core before it could recover.
萨基尔一旦被迫进入近战就迅速倒下，这多少有些令人失望。使徒试图用能量长矛刺穿福音战士，但二号机几乎懒洋洋地拍开了它的手臂，随后一个扫腿将其击倒在地，并在它恢复之前将一把前进式刀插入其核心。

As soon as the dust settled Shinji was impatiently tapping his foot, already looking around for the next target. A strand of hair floated in front of his face and he irritably brushed it back again, wishing he'd remembered to tie his hair back.
尘埃刚一落定，真嗣就不耐烦地跺着脚，已经开始四处寻找下一个目标。一缕头发飘到他面前，他不悦地再次将其拨回，希望自己记得把头发扎起来。

XXX

"We have a-" 我们有个-

"Problem. I know." 问题。我知道。

Ritsuko, surprised by Misato's interruption, looked nonplussed for a moment before continuing. "Their sync ratio is over two hundred and ten percent and still climbing. I really don't like what their brainwaves are doing."
被美里突然打断，律子一时显得有些不知所措，随后继续说道：“他们的同步率已经超过两百一十个百分点，并且还在上升。我真的不喜欢他们脑波现在的变化。”

"Their minds are starting to merge," said Misato, arms crossed and eyes focused on the chamber.
“他们的意识开始融合了，”美里双臂交叉，目光紧盯着舱室。

"How did you know that already?" Ritsuko wondered.
“你怎么这么快就知道了？”律子感到好奇。

Misato glanced sidelong at her friend. "While you were busy staring at what your screens have been telling you about the pilots, I've been watching them." She pointed into the chamber. "Twice now Shinji has mimicked Asuka when she adjusted her hair."
美里侧目看了看她的朋友，说道：“当你忙于盯着屏幕上关于驾驶员的数据时，我一直在观察他们。”她指向舱室，“已经有两次，当明日香整理头发时，真嗣也跟着做了同样的动作。”

"Hmph." Ritsuko, somewhat put off by Misato's insight, turned to look at the teenagers. "Are you also going to tell me why Asuka hasn't acted like Shinji at all yet?"
哼。" 被美里的话稍微触动的律子转头看向那几个少年。"你也要告诉我为什么明日香到现在都没表现得像真嗣那样吗？

"Isn't it obvious?" Misato unfolded her arms and placed her hands on her hips. "Asuka's the one with the bigger personality. Shinji's more... passive."
这不是明摆着吗？" 美里展开双臂，双手叉腰。"明日香个性更强烈。真嗣则更...被动一些。

Through the speakers, the two of them suddenly heard Shinji swear in German as the simulated Shamshel pulled a fast one on them. Misato raised an eyebrow. His words certainly gave weight to what she had just said. "I'm pretty sure he didn't learn that from his teacher."
通过扬声器，两人突然听到真嗣用德语咒骂，因为模拟中的夏姆榭尔给他们来了个出其不意。美里挑了挑眉。他的话无疑印证了她刚才的说法。"我敢肯定，他不是从老师那里学来的。"

"Which one?" asked Ritsuko. "Sounded like he said six words in German there."
哪一句？" 律子问道。"听起来他刚才说了六个德语单词。

"'Arschgesicht'", replied Misato. "It means-"
'混蛋脸'", 米萨托回答道。"意思是-

Ritsuko quickly raised a hand to stop her. "I... think I'll choose to remain ignorant."
律子迅速举起一只手阻止她。"我...觉得我还是选择保持无知吧。"

In the chamber, Asuka and Shinji whooped and cheered in sync as another simulation enemy fell before them. Misato sighed and turned away from the window, running a hand down her face.
在训练室里，明日香和真嗣同步欢呼雀跃，又一个模拟敌人倒在他们面前。米萨托叹了口气，转过身离开窗户，用手抚过脸颊。

"Please stop the test before it gets worse," she said.
"请在情况变得更糟之前停止测试," 她说。

Ritsuko nodded and pressed a button on her console. "Alright you two, we're going to finish up for today." Over the sound of twin groans of frustration, she continued. "We need some time to analyse these results and I think you've had enough fun."
律子点了点头，按下控制台上的一个按钮。“好了，你们两个，今天我们就到这里结束。”在双重的沮丧叹息声中，她继续说道，“我们需要时间来分析这些结果，而且我想你们已经玩够了。”

The scientist's hands flashed across her keyboard as she input the commands to shut the simulation down. Another set of commands brought an end to the pilots' link to Unit-02. The moment she sent the final command, though, something unexpected happened in the chamber.
科学家的手指在键盘上飞快舞动，输入指令关闭模拟程序。另一组指令切断了驾驶员与二号机的连接。然而，就在她发送完最后一道指令的瞬间，舱室内发生了意想不到的情况。

Two yelps of pain. Two pairs of hands clutching at heads. Shinji and Asuka both fell out of their seats and curled into the fetal position, sinking slowly through the LCL to land on the floor.
两声痛苦的尖叫。四只手紧抓着头部。真嗣和明日香双双从座位上跌落，蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，缓缓沉入 LCL 中，最终落在地板上。

Misato swore as she hurried over to the microphone. "What's going on?!"
美里咒骂一声，急忙冲向麦克风。“发生了什么事？！”

"Get a medical team in there!" Ritsuko shouted over her shoulder to Maya, who nodded and made the call. In the chamber, the drainage system kicked in and began sucking the LCL out of the room.
"快叫医疗团队进来！"律子回头对真由喊道，后者点头并立即拨打电话。在室内，排水系统启动，开始抽出房间内的 LCL。

"Guhhh," Asuka moaned, coughing orange liquid out of her lungs and struggling to get back to her feet. "Feels like... someone just ripped half my brain out then taped it back in..."
呃……"明日香呻吟着，咳出肺里的橙色液体，挣扎着试图站起来。"感觉就像……有人刚撕掉我一半的大脑又粘了回去……

"Can't feel my... everything," Shinji mumbled, before hacking up a glob of LCL. He tried to stand, but quickly collapsed.
"我……什么都感觉不到，"真嗣喃喃自语，随即咳出一团 LCL。他试图起身，却很快又倒下了。

Asuka finally managed to get vertical and began making her slow way over to Shinji, moving like an infant who wasn't sure how to walk. She braced herself against Shinji's pilot seat with one hand, and waved the other towards the downed boy. Shinji put out his own hand to grab it... in completely the wrong direction.
明日香终于勉强站稳，开始缓慢地向真嗣挪去，动作像个还不确定如何走路的婴儿。她一手撑在真嗣的驾驶座上，另一只手向倒地的男孩挥动。真嗣伸出手试图抓住她的手……却完全抓错了方向。

Misato frowned at Ritsuko, who sighed and covered her face with a hand. "I'm sure this will only be temporary," she muttered.
美里皱眉看着律子，后者叹了口气，用手捂住了脸。“我相信这只是暂时的，”她低声说道。

"Don't tell me this is going to happen all the time if we go forward with this plan," warned Misato.
“别告诉我，如果我们继续执行这个计划，这种情况会经常发生，”美里警告道。

Ritsuko shook her head. "It appears that not only were they synchronising with Unit-02, they were synchronising with each other as well, which fed back into the Eva and pushed their sync ratio to such a dangerous degree. We'll have to modify the safety systems, and add a limiter to avoid... this," she pointed at the two pilots, who were now being tended to by the just-arrived medical personnel, "in the future."
律子摇了摇头。“看来他们不仅在与二号机同步，彼此之间也在同步，这种反馈进一步推高了与 Eva 的同步率，达到了如此危险的程度。我们必须改进安全系统，并增加一个限制器，以避免……这种情况，”她指着两位驾驶员，他们现在正由刚到的医疗人员照料，“在未来再次发生。”

Misato nodded glumly as she watched the medics ease Asuka and Shinji onto a pair of gurneys. A few words convinced the two of them to stop moving, and the gurneys were wheeled out of the chamber. "Alright." She paused as a thought occurred; one that she didn't like the sound of. "I hate that I'm going to suggest this, but..." She turned to Ritsuko. "Make sure you can disable the limiter. As a last resort... emergency kind of thing."
美里沮丧地点了点头，看着医护人员将明日香和真嗣轻放在两张担架上。几句劝说让两人停止了动作，担架随即被推出舱室。“好吧。”她停顿了一下，一个她不太喜欢的念头浮现出来。“虽然我很讨厌提出这个建议，但是……”她转向律子，“确保你能关闭限制器。作为最后的手段……紧急情况下的那种。”

Ritsuko stared at her for a long moment before responding. "I understand," she quietly said.
律子盯着她看了好一会儿才回答。“我明白了，”她轻声说道。

"Hey!" “嘿！”

Misato and Ritsuko turned around to see the gurneys as they passed through the room. Asuka waved, or tried to wave, at them.
美里和律子转过身，看着担架车穿过房间。明日香挥了挥手，或者说试图向她们挥手。

"What sync ratio did we get?" she practically demanded of them.
“我们的同步率是多少？”她几乎是逼问般地向她们问道。

Ritsuko glanced at Misato, who sighed and nodded. She took a quick look at her screen and turned back to the waiting girl. "Two hundred and nineteen percent."
律子瞥了一眼美里，后者叹了口气并点了点头。她迅速扫了一眼屏幕，然后转回等待的女孩。“百分之二百一十九。”

"Yesssssss," hissed the Second Child. The medic continued to push her gurney, and Misato and Ritsuko just barely heard her mumble, "Shame we can't split it evenly," as she passed through the doorway.
“耶——”第二适格者低声欢呼。医护人员继续推着她的担架车，而美里和律子只勉强听到她穿过门口时嘟囔着，“可惜不能平分。”

"Well at least she's still happy," Ritsuko quipped, shrugging as she began to compile her notes on the test.
“至少她现在还挺高兴的，”律子打趣道，耸了耸肩，开始整理测试笔记。

"Too bad she won't be as happy when we tell her about the limiter," Misato remarked.
“等我们告诉她限制器的事，她可就没这么高兴了，”美里评论道。

"Gee, I'd love to be the one to tell her, but I'm going to be incredibly busy now. Besides, that's something best left to you, I think."
哎呀，我真想亲自告诉她，但我现在会忙得不可开交。再说，这种事还是留给你最合适，我觉得。

"You're such a considerate friend, Rits."
里兹，你真是个体贴的朋友。

"Thank you." 谢谢。

Some medication, a checkup and some rest later, Shinji's brain remembered that his arms and legs actually belonged to him. He still felt like he'd picked a fight with an Angel without an Evangelion, but at least he could move around again. Asuka also seemed to have mostly recovered, but the two of them were still tired after the simulation mishap. Misato was quick to join them when they were cleared to leave the medical ward.
经过一些药物治疗、检查和休息后，真嗣的脑海中终于记起，他的四肢原本就是自己的。尽管他仍感觉像是徒手与使徒打了一架，但至少又能活动了。明日香也似乎恢复得差不多了，但两人在模拟事故后依旧疲惫。一旦获准离开医疗区，美里便迅速加入了他们。

"Despite what happened afterwards, I'd consider today a success," Misato remarked as the trio got into an elevator on their trek to her car.
"尽管后来发生了那些事，我还是认为今天算是成功的，" 美里边说边和三人一起走进电梯，前往她的车。

"I just hope... that doesn't happen every time," Asuka muttered as she rubbed her forehead. "I could do without the brain surgery after every fight."
我只希望...这种事别每次都发生，" 明日香揉着额头嘟囔道。"每次战斗后都来一次脑部手术，我可受不了。

"Well, there's good news and bad news on that front," Misato admitted. When Asuka and Shinji glared dangerously at her, she hastily continued. "The good news is that it shouldn't happen again once the dual-sync plug is finalised. The bad news is that it's because we'll be installing a limiter to stop your sync ratio from getting as dangerously high as it did."
嗯，关于这个，有好消息也有坏消息，" 美里坦承道。见明日香和真嗣危险地瞪着她，她急忙继续说："好消息是，一旦双同步插头最终确定，这种情况应该不会再发生。坏消息是，这是因为我们将安装一个限制器，以防止你们的同步率再次达到那样危险的峰值。

"What?!" Asuka shrieked, her voice incredibly loud in the small elevator. "Screw that, I can handle the aftereffects!"
什么？！" 明日香尖叫起来，声音在狭小的电梯里显得格外响亮。"去他的，我能承受那些后遗症！

Shinji felt himself getting angry as well, but couldn't work out why.
真嗣感到自己也开始生气了，但搞不清楚原因。

"Really?" Misato asked, folding her arms and leaning forward so that her face was level with Asuka's. "I remember you saying that it felt like somebody had ripped half your brain out. Are you sure you want to deal with that every time?"
真的吗？" 美里问道，她双臂交叉，身体前倾，使得自己的脸与明日香的齐平。"我记得你说过，那感觉就像有人把你的半个大脑扯出来一样。你确定每次都想承受那种痛苦吗？

"Just keep some aspirin nearby and I'll be fine!" Asuka retorted.
"只要旁边备点阿司匹林，我就没事！" 明日香反驳道。

Misato rolled her eyes and sighed. "What if it gets worse? What if you end up in a coma after every fight?" Asuka opened her mouth to reply, but Misato got there first. "And what about Shinji? Are you going to ignore what he goes through just because of your obsession with a number?"
美里翻了个白眼，叹了口气。"万一情况恶化了呢？万一每次战斗后你都陷入昏迷怎么办？" 明日香刚要开口回应，但美里抢先一步。"还有真嗣呢？你打算因为自己对一个数字的执着，就无视他所经历的一切吗？"

"I..." Asuka glanced at Shinji, lost for words. Shinji felt the irrational anger get replaced by just as irrational shame. "Fine," Asuka grumbled halfheartedly. "What are we going to get limited to?"
我..." 明日香瞥了一眼真嗣，一时语塞。真嗣感到那股莫名的怒气被同样莫名的羞愧所取代。"好吧，" 明日香半心半意地嘟囔着，"我们会被限制到什么程度？

"I don't know yet, Ritsuko's going to sort that out. It'll most likely be below two hundred, since that's when you two started getting..." Misato brought her hands together, interlacing her fingers before pulling them apart again. "Weird," she lamely said. "Apparently you two were synchronising with each other as well as the Eva."
我还不知道，律子会处理的。很可能限制在两百以下，因为那是你们俩开始变得..." 美里双手合十，交叉手指，然后又拉开。"奇怪，" 她无力地说，"显然你们俩不仅与 Eva 同步，还彼此同步。

Shinji gave a short laugh. "Think of it this way, Asuka. We apparently did so well they had to stop us before we hurt ourselves."
真嗣短促地笑了笑，"这么想吧，明日香。我们显然做得太好，以至于他们不得不在我们伤到自己之前阻止我们。"

Asuka echoed the laugh. "Yeah, I suppose so," she conceded as she leaned against the elevator wall. "So... synchronising with each other, you said?"
明日香也跟着笑了，"是啊，我想也是，" 她靠在电梯墙上，让步道，"那么... 你刚才说，我们彼此同步了？"

Misato nodded. "I was watching you two. Whenever you brushed some hair out of your face, Asuka, Shinji was copying the motion. Looked weird considering how short his hair is."
碇真嗣点了点头。“我一直在观察你们俩。每当明日香你把头发从脸上拨开时，真嗣也在模仿这个动作。考虑到他的头发那么短，看起来挺奇怪的。”

Asuka smirked as she glanced at Shinji, who reddened in embarrassment. He hadn't even realised what he had been doing. Just as he thought that she was about to tease him, she changed the subject.
明日香瞥了一眼真嗣，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，后者则因尴尬而脸红。他甚至没意识到自己在做什么。就在他以为她要取笑他时，她却转移了话题。

"Hey, have they decided on the layout of the entry plug yet?"
“喂，他们决定好插入栓的布局了吗？”

"Uh, I don't think so," Misato replied, nonplussed. "Why? What did you have in mind?"
“呃，我不太清楚，”美里有些摸不着头脑地回答，“怎么了？你有什么想法吗？”

"Oh, nothing major," said Asuka. "I just think it'll be better for us if the seats are positioned one behind the other, instead of side-by-side like they were in the test chamber. I kept feeling like I was too far to the left, if that makes sense."
哦，没什么大不了的，"明日香说，"我只是觉得如果座位像测试室那样一前一后摆放，对我们来说会更好。我总感觉自己太靠左了，这样说你能理解吗？

"Yeah, I had the same kind of feeling," Shinji hastily added, eager to get the conversation as far away from him being a copycat as possible. "Only, you know, on the right."
嗯，我也有类似的感觉，"真嗣急忙补充道，急于将话题从自己模仿他人的行为上转移开。"只不过，你知道的，我是感觉靠右。

"That makes sense, I suppose," said Misato. "I'll pass your suggestion on to Ritsuko."
我想这也有道理，"美里说，"我会把你们的建议转告给律子。

The elevator dinged, and the door opened. Shinji and Asuka made to pass through the doorway, but it was too small for them both to leave at the same time. They stopped upon realising this, looking at each other and gesturing for the other to go first. Then they realised that they were mirroring each others movements, and groaned in unison.
电梯叮的一声响，门开了。真嗣和明日香正要穿过门口，但门太窄，两人无法同时出去。意识到这一点后，他们停了下来，互相看着对方，示意对方先走。随即他们意识到自己在模仿对方的动作，便同时发出了一声叹息。

"Boy, I hope this wears off soon," Misato remarked, taking hold of Asuka's shoulder and pushing her out of the elevator. "Imagine what your friends would think if they saw you acting like this."
哎呀，希望这状态快点过去，" 葛城美里说着，抓住明日香肩膀将她推出电梯。"想想看，要是你朋友看到你这样会怎么想。

Shinji reddened as he followed them, remembering that Kensuke had called him and Asuka a 'married couple' a while ago. The last thing he wanted was for something like that to spread around the school.
真嗣跟在后面，脸颊泛红，想起之前洞木光曾调侃他和明日香像'小夫妻'。他最不希望的就是这种事在学校里传开。

"Actually, keep it up. Gives me more ammunition to tease you with."
其实，你继续这样挺好，给我更多调侃你的素材。

"Misato!" 美里！

Thankfully, the effects of the test wore off completely once Shinji and Asuka reached their apartment and split up to do separate things. Asuka watched television while playing a handheld game console, while Shinji got started on the homework that Rei had brought around for them.
幸好，测试的影响在真嗣和明日香回到公寓并各自忙活后完全消退了。明日香边看电视边玩掌上游戏机，而真嗣则开始做零带来的作业。

When told about what had happened after the tests over dinner, Rei said, "Doctor Akagi is right to impose a limit. An excessively high sync ratio could potentially be dangerous."
晚餐时听闻测试后的情况，零说道：“赤木博士设限是正确的。同步率过高可能潜藏危险。”

"More dangerous than feeling weird when we disconnect?" Shinji asked.
“比我们断开连接时的异样感还要危险吗？”真嗣问道。

"Much worse." Rei's eyes were steely. "If your synchronisation is too high you could lose yourself, unable to distinguish between yourself and the Evangelion."
“严重得多。”零的眼神坚定如钢。“如果同步率过高，你可能会迷失自我，无法区分自己与福音战士。”

Asuka's eyebrows raised. "You sound like you're talking from experience."
明日香的眉毛一挑。“你这话听起来像是亲身经历过似的。”

Rei nodded, her expression growing distant. "Two years ago, one of the safety systems malfunctioned during a test. My sync ratio reached over two hundred and eighty percent." She turned her head away from Asuka and Shinji, staring at nothing. "I saw no screen, felt no controls or pilot seat." Rei looked back at them. "For twenty-eight seconds, I was the Evangelion."
绫波点了点头，神情变得遥远。“两年前，在一次测试中，其中一个安全系统出现了故障。我的同步率达到了两百八十多。”她转过头，不再看向明日香和真嗣，目光空洞。“我没有看到屏幕，也没有感觉到控制器或驾驶座。”绫波回头看向他们。“有二十八秒，我就是那台 EVA。”

Shinji paused with a morsel of food halfway between bowl and mouth. He couldn't tell if Asuka's eyes had widened in surprise at the story, or at Rei's sync ratio. He shook his head in amazement, then said, "There's... no chance something like that will happen again, right?"
真嗣正要送进嘴里的一口食物停在了半空。他分不清明日香瞪大的眼睛是因为故事本身，还是因为绫波的同步率。他摇了摇头，惊叹不已，然后问道：“那样的事情……不会再发生了吧？”

"No," replied Rei. "As I said, that was two years ago. Every single safety system was immediately overhauled to prevent something like that from happening again."
“不会了，”绫波回答。“正如我所说，那是两年前的事。所有的安全系统都立即进行了彻底改造，以防类似事件再次发生。”

The rest of the meal time passed in awkward silence. After finishing dinner and cleaning up, Rei retired to Misato's apartment, taking their guardian's portion of dinner with her to store in the fridge. Asuka and Shinji continued with their game and homework respectively until it was time to turn in.
余下的用餐时间在尴尬的沉默中度过。晚餐结束后，收拾完毕，绫波带着监护人那份晚餐回到美里家，将其存入冰箱。明日香和真嗣则各自继续他们的游戏和作业，直至就寝时刻。

Three hours later Shinji woke up breathing heavily. He rubbed his head as he tried to recall the strange dream he had. In the end, all that he could make out was running down a dark hallway that had lots of doors leading off of it, while something slowly creaked in the distance. Groaning, he opened the curtains and cracked open a window to let some more air circulate through the room, then tumbled back into bed where he had a dreamless sleep for the rest of the night.
三小时后，真嗣醒来，呼吸急促。他揉着头试图回忆那个奇怪的梦。最终，他只记得自己在一个有许多门分岔的黑暗走廊里奔跑，远处传来缓慢的吱嘎声。他呻吟着拉开窗帘，推开窗户让更多空气流通，然后倒回床上，余下的夜晚无梦而眠。

Several days passed before Shinji and Asuka were called back for another test of the dual-sync system. Ritsuko had apparently taken Asuka's advice, as this time the test chamber had a fully built entry plug with the seats positioned just as the Second Child had suggested.
几天后，真嗣和明日香再次被召集进行双人同步系统的测试。显然，律子采纳了明日香的建议，这次测试室配备了一个完整的插入栓，座椅位置正如第二适格者所提议的那样。

With the modified safety systems and limiter in place, Asuka was disappointed that they 'only' peaked at one hundred and nine percent synchronisation during the test. Shinji had to remind her that it was just a simulation, and that real combat had been where they had had their best performance.
在安全系统和限制器经过改良后，尽管测试中同步率最高只达到了百分之一百零九，这让明日香感到失望。真嗣不得不提醒她，这仅仅是模拟，真正的战斗中他们才展现出了最佳状态。

It was when Asuka and Shinji had almost reached home after that test that something not entirely unexpected happened. Their driver, a Section Two agent, suddenly put a finger to his ear for a moment before making the black sedan do a harsh one-eighty turn to rival Misato's driving.
就在明日香和真嗣测试结束后几乎要到家时，一件并非完全出乎意料的事情发生了。他们的司机，一位第二部门的特工，突然用手指轻触了一下耳朵，随即驾驶着黑色轿车来了个急转弯，其激烈程度堪比美里。

"Sorry kids," the man remarked. "But it looks like duty calls for you."
“抱歉了，孩子们，”那人说道，“看来你们又有任务了。”

Shinji pulled himself back upright after being flung about by the sudden manoeuvre. "An Angel?"
真嗣在被突如其来的操作甩得东倒西歪后，重新坐直了身子，问道：“是使徒吗？”

"Large object detected heading towards the Kii Peninsula. No need to guess what that means. Got fifteen minutes to get you two ready to give it a warm welcome." The engine roared as the agent pushed the car to its limits.
"检测到大型物体正朝纪伊半岛逼近。不用猜也知道这意味着什么。我们有十五分钟时间，让你们俩准备好热烈迎接它。"引擎轰鸣，特工将车辆推至极限。

Asuka looked at Shinji. "You know what this means," she said.
明日香看着真嗣，"你知道这代表什么。"她说道。

Shinji gulped, suddenly nervous, but he held Asuka's gaze. "Y-yeah."
真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫，但他依然迎着明日香的目光，"嗯，知道。"

"Time for us to show them what we can do together."
是时候让他们见识我们联手的能力了。

"Yeah." 对。

Asuka leaned closer, practically nose to nose with Shinji. A fire began to burn in her eyes "Come on. Time to get pumped up. That Angel is going to regret ever setting foot on Earth."
明日香凑得更近了，几乎与真嗣鼻尖相碰。她的眼中燃起了火焰，“来吧，该振奋起来了。那个使徒要是后悔踏足地球就好了。”

Shinji nodded resolutely. "Yeah!"
真嗣坚定地点了点头，“没错！”

"What are we going to do?" Asuka was almost shouting now.
“我们该怎么做？”明日香几乎是在喊叫。

Shinji's response was a shout. "We're going to kick that Angel's ass!"
真嗣的回答也是一声大喊，“我们要把那个使徒打得落花流水！”


---
### Chapter 16 Israfel

"That Angel kicked your ass."
那个使徒把你打得落花流水。

Shinji groaned, somewhat muffled by the fact that he was slumped over in his chair face down on the table in the briefing room. The tone of Misato's voice was clearly that of an angry and disappointed superior who had expected much better. Not that he could blame her; it had been his fault everything had gone wrong.
真嗣呻吟着，声音有些闷，因为他整个人瘫坐在椅子上，脸朝下趴在简报室的桌子上。美里说话的语气明显是一个愤怒且失望的上级，她本期待更好的表现。他也不能怪她；一切出错都是他的责任。

Because he hadn't thought to make sure that the Angel was actually dead when Unit-02 cut it in half.
因为他没有想过要确认使徒在被二号机切成两半后是否真的死了。

"I must say, that was a rather disastrous performance out there."
我得说，那场表现实在是相当糟糕。

Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki had apparently been a university professor before joining NERV. That would certainly explain how his voice could radiate such intense disapproval while also sounding like he was still holding out hope that the person could do better.
副司令冬月似乎在加入 NERV 之前曾是一名大学教授。这无疑解释了他声音中为何能同时散发出强烈的责备与仍抱有一线希望的复杂情感。

"Let's go through what happened," said the Sub-Commander. "We also need to work out what happened to Pilot Ayanami."
“我们得梳理一下发生了什么，”副司令说道，“同时也要弄清楚飞行员绫波的情况。”

Shinji looked up at that. "Is... is she alright?" he asked.
听到这话，真嗣抬起头来，“她...她还好吗？”他问道。

"We don't know yet. Doctor Akagi is currently tending to her," replied Fuyutsuki. He activated a projector screen, flashing an image of Unit-00 and Unit-02 facing off against a vaguely humanoid shape. "What we do know is that right before you engaged the Angel, her vital signs began wildly fluctuating and she soon lost synchronisation with Unit-00. You continued on to engage the Angel, splitting it in half in one strike. Those halves shaped themselves into two separate entities, and Target-Beta advanced on Unit-00 while Target-Alpha attacked Unit-02."
“目前还不清楚。赤木博士正在照看她，”冬月回答道。他启动了一个投影屏幕，上面闪现出零号机与二号机正面对峙一个模糊人形物体的画面。“我们所知道的是，就在你与使徒交战之前，她的生命体征开始剧烈波动，并很快与零号机失去了同步。你继续与使徒交战，一击将其劈成两半。这两半各自形成了两个独立的实体，目标贝塔向零号机逼近，而目标阿尔法则攻击了二号机。”

The projector screen changed to show two humanoid shapes, one orange and one silver, standing near the two Evangelions that were now laying on the ground. To the right of Shinji, Asuka was growling. He glanced sideways at her and saw that she was scowling heavily, staring at nothing with her arms crossed.
投影屏幕切换，显示出两个类人形体，一橙一银，站在现已倒地的两台福音战士附近。在真嗣右边，明日香正低声咆哮。他侧目看去，只见她双眉紧锁，双臂交叉，目光空洞地盯着前方。

"For some reason, Unit-02 seemed to stop moving properly," Fuyutsuki continued. "Radio transmissions we received from the entry plug shows that you and Pilot Soryu were arguing with each other." He glared at them both. "And while you two were arguing, Target-Alpha easily dealt with you."
“不知何故，二号机似乎停止了正常运作，”冬月继续说道，“我们从插入栓接收到的无线电通讯显示，你和索尔尤飞行员正在争吵。”他严厉地扫视着他们俩。“而当你们争吵时，目标阿尔法轻易地击败了你们。”

Fuyutsuki looked expectantly at Shinji and Asuka, neither of which had anything to say. He threw his hands up in frustration. "Shall I play the argument that was recorded then?" he asked in a somewhat ominous tone. "Or maybe I should show what we have of the entire debacle, so we all can see what may have just made us a laughingstock in front of the JSSDF. We even had to call them in for an N2 strike to disable the Angel."
冬月期待地看着真嗣和明日香，两人都无言以对。他无奈地举起双手。“要我播放录下的争吵吗？”他以一种略带不祥的语气问道，“或者，也许我应该展示整个混乱场面的录像，这样我们都能看到是什么让我们在自卫队面前成了笑柄。我们甚至不得不请求他们进行 N2 打击来摧毁使徒。”

"There's no need for that, sir," Shinji finally spoke up. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of Asuka turning her head to look at him. "I'm the one to blame for Unit-02's performance."
那倒不必了，先生，" 最终，真嗣开口了。他用余光瞥见明日香转过头来看着他。"是我在操作二号机时出了问题。

A quick dart of his eyes to the right showed that Asuka was now staring incredulously at him.
他迅速向右一瞥，发现明日香正难以置信地盯着他。

"Oh?" Fuyutsuki raised his eyebrows. "You're saying that what happened out there was your fault alone, Pilot Ikari?"
哦？" 冬月挑起眉毛。"你是说，外面发生的一切都是你一个人的责任，碇真嗣驾驶员？

"Y-yes sir," Shinji stammered. "I was the one that insisted we help Rei. Because Asuka and I weren't working together, we lost synchronisation."
是-是的，先生，" 真嗣结巴着回答。"是我坚持要去帮助绫波。因为我和明日香没有协同作战，我们失去了同步。

There was a loud slap of flesh on wood; all eyes were drawn to the source of the sound. "Damnit Third, stop playing the damned martyr whenever something bad happens!" Asuka shouted.
一声肉体撞击木头的巨响传来，所有目光都被吸引到了声源处。“该死的，老三，别每次出事就装成受难者！”明日香吼道。

"Pilot Soryu? Do you have something to add?"
“二号机驾驶员，你有什么要补充的吗？”

Asuka looked at the sub-commander and nodded her head. "Sir, I could have just gone along with what Shinji wanted to do, instead of trying to engage the orange- er, Target-Alpha." While she was speaking respectfully, Shinji could see that she was holding her anger back. Barely.
明日香看向副指挥官，点了点头。“长官，我本可以顺着真嗣的想法去做，而不是试图去攻击那个橙色的——呃，目标阿尔法。”尽管她说话时态度恭敬，但真嗣能看出她正极力压抑着怒火，几乎难以自持。

Fuyutsuki sighed heavily as he rubbed his forehead. "So then where did all that teamwork go? You two were doing so well in the simulations that Doctor Akagi had to implement a limiter for your own safety."
冬月沉重地叹了口气，揉着额头。“那么，那种团队合作精神都去哪儿了？你们俩在模拟训练中表现出色，以至于赤木博士不得不为你们的安全设置了限制器。”

"I think I can explain that, sir," Misato cut in. "The simulations were just... well... simulations. And they were against Angels that we already knew everything about. Shinji and Asuka would have had no trouble against them because they knew precisely what to do." She glanced at the two teenagers. "But when it came to something new and unexpected, while there was a teammate in danger, they both had different ideas of what needed to be done."
我想我可以解释这一点，先生，" 葛城插话道。"那些模拟只是...嗯...模拟。而且是对付我们已经了如指掌的使徒。真嗣和明日香对付它们本应毫无困难，因为他们完全知道该怎么做。" 她瞥了一眼两个少年。"但当面对新奇且出乎意料的情况，且队友处于危险时，他们各自有不同的应对想法。

"I see." Fuyutsuki stroked his chin in thought. "I suppose we should have seen this coming. Even from what little I know about Pilots Soryu and Ikari, I know that they react differently to certain situations." He glanced at Shinji and Asuka, and there was something in his eyes that made Shinji feel like the grey-haired man knew something they didn't.
"我明白了。" 冬月抚着下巴沉思。"我们本应预见到这一点。尽管我对飞行员惣流和碇的了解不多，但我知道他们在某些情况下反应不同。" 他看向真嗣和明日香，眼中流露出的某种神情让真嗣觉得这位灰发男子知道一些他们不知道的事情。

Asuka scoffed. "Well, if that bottle blonde hadn't decided to limit how awesome we could be, we would have been able to sync with each other and not had a problem."
明日香嗤之以鼻。"哼，如果那个金发女郎没决定限制我们的发挥，我们本可以同步合作，根本不会出问题。"

"Right until the fight ends and you potentially fall into a coma," Misato retorted. "Safety systems are there for a reason. To keep you safe."
直到战斗结束，你可能会陷入昏迷，" 葛城反驳道。"安全系统存在是有原因的。为了保护你们的安全。

"Precisely," said Fuyutsuki. He turned back to the projector, and changed images. Now the screen showed diagrams of the twin Angels. "The point is moot anyway. Analysis indicates that both halves will need to be engaged simultaneously. Meaning that we will need two Evangelions. On your own, even if you had not been fighting each other for control, you would likely have still failed."
正是如此，" 冬月说道。他转回投影仪，切换了图像。屏幕上现在展示着双子使徒的图表。"无论如何，这一点已无争议。分析表明，两部分需要同时被攻击。这意味着我们需要两台福音战士。即使你们没有为了控制权而互相争斗，单凭你一个人，很可能还是会失败。

Misato started to look shifty as Fuyutsuki pointedly glanced at her. "Pilot Ayanami is currently indisposed, and we're not sure how long that will last." He turned to look at the pilots. "It's a shame, considering the dual-sync plug has just been developed, but it appears that it will be useless for this engagement."
当冬月特意看向她时，美里开始显得有些不安。"第一适格者绫波目前无法行动，我们还不确定这种情况会持续多久。" 他转向看着驾驶员们。"真可惜，考虑到刚刚开发出的双人同步插头，但似乎这次战斗中它将无用武之地。"

"What are we going to do then?" Shinji despondently asked. "I'm pretty sure I won't be allowed to pilot on my own." He wondered just what was wrong with the First Child, and if she would be able to work with Asuka to take down this Angel.
"那我们该怎么办呢？" 真嗣沮丧地问道。"我很确定我一个人不会被允许驾驶。" 他不禁思索第一适格者到底出了什么问题，以及她是否能与明日香合作，共同击败这个使徒。

Fuyutsuki smiled thinly. "I believe that when the time comes, you'll be out there fighting, Pilot Ikari. Now then, you two should head home and rest for today. We have a week to come up with a solution, and I believe that solution will soon make itself known to you. Dismissed."
冬月淡淡一笑，说道：“我相信，时机一到，你会在战场上奋战的，碇真嗣驾驶员。那么，你们俩现在应该回家休息了。我们有一周的时间来想出解决方案，我相信这个方案很快就会向你揭晓。解散。”

The two teenagers stood up and saluted Fuyutsuki before filing out of the briefing room. The door closed behind Shinji, and he turned to look at it, realising that Misato was still in there.
两位少年站起身来，向冬月敬礼后，依次走出了简报室。门在真嗣身后关上，他转头望去，意识到美里还在里面。

"Come on Third," Asuka barked, dragging his attention to her. "If we were 'real soldiers'-" she put her hands up to make finger quotes, "I'd say we should go drown our sorrows at the nearest bar. Unfortunately we're just good little children who should go home and do our homework."
“走吧，第三适格者，”明日香厉声说道，将他的注意力拉回到她身上。“如果我们是‘真正的士兵’——”她双手举起，用手指比划着引号，“我会说我们应该去最近的酒吧借酒消愁。可惜我们只是乖巧的小孩，应该回家做作业。”

Shinji mentally agreed with her sardonic attitude. He glanced one last time at the closed door, taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling it. "Let's stop off at the grocery store on the way home then," he suggested. "I have an idea for how we can at least feel a little better."
真嗣内心赞同她那讽刺的态度。他最后一次瞥了一眼紧闭的门，深吸一口气，缓缓呼出。“那我们回家路上顺便去趟超市吧，”他提议道，“我有个主意，至少能让我们感觉好一点。”

Asuka rolled her eyes and turned to walk down the corridor, dismissively waving a hand. "Fine, but you're paying."
明日香翻了个白眼，转身沿着走廊走去，不耐烦地挥了挥手。“好吧，但得你请客。”

The moment the door clicked shut behind Shinji, Misato felt the full force of Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki's stare on the back of her head. She turned around despondently.
真嗣刚一关门，美里就感觉到副司令冬月那锐利的目光正盯着自己的后脑勺。她沮丧地转过身来。

"Hmph," Fuyutsuki grunted at her, sitting down on one one side of the table. Misato got the hint and sat down opposite him, already feeling like a chastened school girl in front of the principal. The only thing that could make it worse would be if the Sub-Commander decided to do that hand thing Commander Ikari did all the time. Fortunately, his second-in-command elected to keep his hands clasped on the table as he spoke.
“哼，”冬月对着她哼了一声，坐到了桌子的一侧。美里会意地坐到他对面，感觉自己就像个在校长面前受训的学生。唯一能让情况更糟的，就是副司令要是学司令那样做那个手势。幸好，他的副手选择将双手交握在桌上，开始说话。

"After today's attack was aborted, you came to me and confessed that you believed you were the reason for Pilot Ayanami's incapacitation. Considering everything that was happening at the time, I wasn't immediately able to question you on the details. But now we have time."
“在今天的袭击被中止后，你来找我坦白，认为你是导致绫波驾驶员失去行动能力的原因。考虑到当时的情况，我没能立刻追问细节。但现在我们有时间了。”

Misato nodded, unable to maintain eye contact with Fuyutsuki for more than a few seconds at a time. She took a deep breath and began to speak.
美里点了点头，无法与冬月保持超过几秒钟的对视。她深吸一口气，开始说道。

"I happened to be awake early this morning, thanks to the call of nature getting me out of bed. I was going to the bathroom when I saw Ayanami in the kitchen with a glass of water and a handful of pills..."
今早我碰巧醒得早，因为生理需求把我从床上叫了起来。我正要去洗手间，就看到绫波在厨房里，手里拿着一杯水和一把药片……

XXX

"Rei..." Misato hesitantly began, staring at the array of tiny coloured pills in the girl's pale hand. "What are those?"
绫波……" 美里迟疑地开口，盯着女孩苍白手掌中的那一小堆彩色药丸。"那些是什么？

Rei turned to look at her. "This is prescription medication," she quietly replied. She made to put the pills into her mouth, but Misato quickly raised a hand to stop her.
绫波转头看向她，轻声回答："这是处方药。" 她正要将药片送入口中，但美里迅速举起手阻止了她。

"Wait a second," said Misato. "How long have you had this prescription? This is the first time I've seen you take any medication since coming to live here."
等一下，" 碇真嗣说。"你这个处方开了多久了？自从你来这里住，我还是第一次见你吃药。

"I have had this prescription for as long as I can remember," said Rei. "You have not seen me take them because of your sleep schedule, as I always take the pills when I wake up."
这个处方我记事起就有了，" 绫波丽回答。"你没见过我吃药是因为你的作息时间，我总是在起床时服用。

Misato huffed. Despite the girl's ever neutral tone, it had still somehow sounded like Rei was taking a slight dig at her sleeping habits. "Well then... what are those pills?" she asked, stepping closer to examine them. There sure seemed to be a lot of them.
碇真嗣哼了一声。尽管女孩的语气一如既往地平淡，但不知怎的，听起来绫波丽似乎在暗讽她的睡眠习惯。"那...这些药是干嘛的？" 她问着，走近了些想要仔细查看。那些药丸看起来确实不少。

"I am not allowed to talk about my prescription," Rei stiffly replied, closing her hand and hiding the pills from Misato's sight.
"我不能谈论我的处方，" 绫波丽生硬地回答，随即合拢手掌，将药丸从碇真嗣的视线中隐藏起来。

"What? Not allowed?" Misato reared back slightly in surprise. "They're pills, not top secret weapons."
什么？不允许吗？" 葛城美里略显惊讶地往后一仰。"它们只是药片，又不是什么绝密武器。

Rei blinked slowly. "I am not a-"
绫波缓缓地眨了眨眼。"我不是——"

"I heard you the first time!" Misato exasperatedly interrupted, putting a hand to her forehead as she sighed heavily. "Look, as your superior officer and guardian, your health is my concern. The same with Asuka and Shinji. If they were on medication I would need to know what it is and how it could affect them."
我第一次就听见了！" 葛城美里不耐烦地打断她，一手扶额，重重地叹了口气。"听着，作为你的上级和监护人，你的健康是我关心的。同样也包括明日香和真嗣。如果他们在服药，我需要知道是什么药，以及它可能对他们产生什么影响。

It was only somewhat truthful, but Misato could see that Rei was mulling over her words. Finally, the girl nodded and put the glass of water down next to the sink. "The bottles are in my room," she said as she headed down the small hallway towards her bedroom, fist still clenched tight.
这话虽有些半真半假，但葛城美里看得出绫波正在思索她的话。最终，女孩点了点头，将那杯水放在水槽旁。"药瓶在我房间里，"她说着，朝那条狭小的走廊走向自己的卧室，拳头依旧紧握。

As Misato stepped into the bedroom, she was shocked to see that Rei had a messy bedroom. While it wasn't filthy, there were clothes all over the place despite there being a perfectly functional wardrobe. On one hand, she was a teenage girl. On the other, it was Rei that always did the dishes in the morning before heading to school. Misato wondered what Asuka, also a teenage girl but one who kept her room scrupulously clean, would think about Rei's living space and considered how to steer the redhead towards discovering this mess.
当碇真嗣走进卧室时，她惊讶地发现绫波丽的房间一片凌乱。虽然不算脏乱，但衣服到处都是，尽管有一个功能完好的衣柜。一方面，她是个少女；另一方面，绫波丽总是在早上上学前负责洗碗。碇真嗣好奇，同样是少女但房间一尘不染的明日香，会如何看待绫波丽的居住环境，并考虑如何引导这位红发少女发现这一片狼藉。

In the meantime, Misato had more important things to deal with. She strode over to Rei's bedside table, boggling at the sight of eight pill bottles sitting there.
与此同时，碇真嗣还有更重要的事情要处理。她大步走向绫波丽的床头柜，看到上面摆着八瓶药时，不禁目瞪口呆。

All unlabelled. 全都没有标签。

"Rei..." Misato looked back at the girl. She decided to start with what she hoped was a simple query. "Why don't these bottles have labels? How do you know which is which?"
绫波..." 碇真嗣回头看向女孩。她决定从她希望是简单的问题开始。"为什么这些瓶子没有标签？你怎么知道哪个是哪个？

"Labels are not necessary," Rei stoically replied. "I must take one of each every morning."
无需贴标签，" 绫波冷静地回答，"我每天早上都必须各取一粒。

"But you don't even know what they are! What they could do to you!"
可你甚至不知道它们是什么！它们可能对你产生什么影响！

"I have had this prescription for many years. I am used to them."
这个处方我已经用了多年。我已经习惯了。

Misato stared incredulously at Rei, swearing mentally. "So you know nothing at all about the stuff you put in your body every single day. Not even what they're called."
美里难以置信地盯着绫波，内心咒骂着。"所以你对自己每天摄入的东西一无所知。甚至连它们的名字都不知道。"

Rei looked thoughtful for a moment, then replied, "I think I know one of them. I heard Doctor Akagi mention... clonazepam."
绫波沉思了片刻，然后回答道：“我想我知道其中一种。我听赤木博士提到过……氯硝西泮。”

Misato inhaled sharply, her eyes widening in shock. Clonazepam had been... forcibly prescribed to her when she had become catatonic after the events of Second Impact, by the people she had been placed into the care of. She had later learned that the one doctor among them had lost his medical license, but she couldn't remember if that had happened beforehand or afterwards. Thanks to all the drugs they had pumped into her in the name of science, most of that period of her life was a blur.
美里倒吸一口凉气，震惊地睁大了眼睛。氯硝西泮曾是……在她第二次冲击事件后陷入木僵状态时，被迫给她开的药，由那些负责照顾她的人所为。后来她得知，那些人中的一个医生已经失去了行医执照，但她记不清那是在之前还是之后了。由于他们以科学的名义给她注射了大量药物，那段时期的生活大多模糊不清。

Now she swore audibly, running a hand through her hair as she spoke. "Shit, Rei... these are just anti-depressants and such. Why the hell are you taking so many?!"
此刻她不禁咒骂出声，一边说话一边用手捋着头发。“该死，绫波……这些不过是抗抑郁药之类的东西。你为什么要吃这么多？！”

Rei didn't seem to have an answer, simply standing there and staring at her. With a snarl, Misato turned and swept a hand across the bedside table, knocking the pill bottles onto the ground in front of Rei's feet.
绫波似乎没有答案，只是站在那里盯着她。美里怒气冲冲地转身，一挥手将床头柜上的药瓶扫落在绫波脚前的地上。

"I don't want you taking these anymore," Misato ordered. "There's no reason why a girl like you should be doping herself up like this."
我不想你再吃这些了，" 葛城命令道，"像你这样的女孩没有理由这样依赖药物。

"But... Commander Ikari said that I must take them," said an uncertain-sounding Rei.
"但是... 碇司令说我必须服用它们，" 绫波丽的声音听起来有些不确定。

Misato grit her teeth. "And what if he ordered you to kill yourself?" Rei opened her mouth, but Misato barrelled on. "Military personnel have no obligation to follow illegal or immoral orders."
葛城咬紧牙关。"那如果他命令你去自杀呢？" 绫波张开嘴，但葛城继续说道，"军人没有义务执行非法或不道德的命令。"

Rei looked down at the bottles, shifting uncomfortably. Misato sighed as she tried to bring her emotions back under control. "Please, Rei. You're not old or sick; there's nothing wrong with you."
绫波低头看着那些瓶子，显得局促不安。葛城叹了口气，试图平复自己的情绪。"拜托了，绫波。你既不老也不病，你没有任何问题。"

After what seemed like an eternity, Rei held up her clenched fist and looked at it for a while, before opening it and letting the pills drop to the ground. Misato exhaled in relief and moved over to her, laying a hand on her shoulder.
仿佛过了许久，绫波终于举起紧握的拳头，凝视片刻后缓缓张开，任由药片散落一地。美里如释重负地舒了口气，走过去轻抚她的肩膀。

"Thank you Rei," she softly murmured, relieved that the girl had decided to trust her.
“谢谢你，绫波。”她轻声呢喃，欣慰于少女选择了信任自己。

XXX

Misato stopped talking as she leaned forward, propping her head up with her hands, elbows resting on the table.
美里停止了话语，身体前倾，双手托腮，肘部撑在桌上。

Across from her, Fuyutsuki digested what she had just told him. Her own outlook wasn't very good. Penalties were harsh for those that poisoned or otherwise made military personnel unable to perform their duty. Misato recalled an incident in boot camp when a private had been bollocked from one end of the training ground to the other for tying another private's boots to a bedpost before reveille, resulting in the victim suffering a broken nose.
对面，冬月消化着她刚透露的信息。她自己的处境并不乐观。对于那些毒害或以其他方式使军事人员无法履行职责的行为，惩罚向来严厉。美里回忆起新兵训练营时，一名士兵因在起床号前将另一名士兵的靴子绑在床柱上，导致受害者鼻子骨折，而被从训练场一端训斥到另一端的往事。

All Misato had going for her was that what she had done wasn't out of malice.
美里唯一能为自己辩解的，就是她的所作所为并非出于恶意。

"While your efforts were noble," Fuyutsuki finally said, "you are not a medical professional. As such, you should not be making judgements on a person's medication."
尽管你的初衷是好的，" 冬月最终说道，"但你并非医疗专业人士。因此，你不应该对一个人的药物治疗做出判断。

Misato nodded dolefully, ready to accept her punishment.
美里沮丧地点了点头，准备接受她的惩罚。

"Ayanami's medication is not simply emotional adjusters. Did it ever occur to you that Clonazepam is in her prescription to counteract the effects of one of the other drugs?"
绫波的药物不仅仅是情绪调节剂。你有没有想过，她处方中的氯硝西泮是为了抵消其他药物的副作用？

"No sir," Misato admitted. "When Ayanami mentioned that drug, all I could think of was how I had been treated after Second Impact. I hated the thought of somebody else going through what I did. That somebody else was just getting drugged to keep them pliant."
没有，长官，" 碇真嗣承认道，"当绫波提到那种药物时，我满脑子想的都是第二次冲击后我所经历的治疗。我讨厌想到还有人要经历我所经历的一切。而那个人只是被药物控制，变得顺从。

"Yes," Fuyutsuki mused. "I am very much aware of what you went through back then. Though it does explain your reaction, it is not a valid excuse for what you did to Ayanami."
是的，" 冬月沉思着说，"我非常清楚你当时经历了什么。虽然这解释了你的反应，但这并不是你对待绫波的正当理由。

Misato slowly breathed in and out. "What is my punishment, sir?"
碇真嗣缓缓地吸气又呼气，"我的惩罚是什么，长官？"

Fuyutsuki closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, tapping his index fingers together in his lap. "Fortuitously for you, Captain, you are too valuable to summarily dismiss or imprison with an Angel on our doorstep." He opened his eyes and looked down his nose at her. "Consider yourself on probation for the time being. Your pay will also be docked. However..."
冬月闭上眼睛，靠在椅背上，手指在膝上轻轻敲击。"幸运的是，碇队长，你太重要了，不能在天使即将到来之际轻易解雇或监禁。暂时你将被置于观察期。你的薪水也会被扣除。但是……"

Puzzled, Misato looked up at the Sub-Commander.
困惑中，葛城美里抬头望向副司令。

"As I said, there is an Angel on our doorstep. One that will require an unconventional method to eliminate." Fuyutsuki suddenly leaned forward. "Prove that you are still worthy of your position as NERV's Tactical Operations Officer, and I may be convinced to keep this incident quiet."
正如我所说，有一个使徒就在我们门前。要消灭它，需要一种非常规的方法。" 冬月突然倾身向前，"证明你仍然配得上 NERV 战术作战部长的职位，我或许会考虑对此事保持沉默。

"...Sir?" Misato blinked in confusion.
"...长官？" 美里眨了眨眼，一脸迷茫。

"Ayanami will make a full recovery," Fuyutsuki explained. "I will admit to you that something similar has happened a long time ago, where she missed a dose. That was the result of a forgetful nurse though, not a well-meaning guardian. However, because of the condition her medication manages, she will be unavailable for duty for at least a week."
绫波会完全康复的，" 冬月解释道，"我承认，很久以前也发生过类似情况，她漏服了一次药物。那次是因为一个粗心的护士，而非出于好意的监护人。但由于她药物控制的状况，至少一周内她无法执行任务。

"A week?" More confusion was heaped upon Misato. "Sir, just what is wrong with Ayanami that missing one dose puts her out of action for a week?"
一周？"更多的困惑堆积在美里身上。"长官，绫波到底出了什么问题，少服一次药就会让她一周都无法行动？

Fuyutsuki's voice turned ominous. "You are not cleared to know that. If and when the time comes that you need to know, you will be told then. Not until."
冬月声音变得阴沉。"你没有权限知道这个。如果到了你需要知道的时候，自然会告诉你。在此之前，不会透露。"

"Erm... yes sir," Misato abashedly replied.
"呃... 是的，长官，"美里尴尬地回答。

Confusion piled upon confusion, in turn piled upon wondering just what the hell was going on with Rei Ayanami. Just what could be wrong with her that missing a single dose of medication would cripple her for an entire week?
困惑之上又叠加了困惑，进而又叠加了对绫波丽身上究竟发生了什么的疑惑。她到底有什么问题，以至于错过一次药物就会让她整整一周都无法行动？

"With the First Child indisposed, you will therefore only have Pilots Soryu and Ikari available for this sortie," Fuyutsuki continued as if nothing had happened. "It is up to you to work within your... limitations to defeat this Angel. As Commander Ikari is away on business for two weeks, I am in charge. Understand that I will listen to any reasonable ideas you put in front of me."
由于第一适格者身体不适，本次出击你将只能调用驾驶员惣流和碇。"冬月继续说道，仿佛一切如常。"你们必须在自己的...局限内击败这只使徒。由于碇司令出差两周，目前由我负责。记住，我会听取你们提出的任何合理建议。

Misato knew exactly what Fuyutsuki meant by 'limitations'. The strange situation between Shinji and Asuka meant that it was dangerous for Shinji to pilot solo. But... he had just said he would listen to 'any reasonable idea'. A thought occurred: was the Sub-Commander surreptitiously stating that he would allow Shinji and Unit-01 to fight if she came up with a good enough plan to justify the risk?
美里完全明白冬月所说的“局限”是什么意思。真嗣和明日香之间的微妙关系意味着真嗣单独驾驶存在风险。但是...他刚才说会听取“任何合理的想法”。一个念头闪过：副司令是否在暗示，如果她能提出一个足够好的计划来证明风险是值得的，他会允许真嗣和初号机出战？

"Captain?" 舰长？

Misato shook her head and shot to her feet, snapping off a salute to please even the hardest of superior officers. "Sir, it is the duty of NERV to eliminate the Angel threat. I will not fail in my duty again."
美里摇了摇头，猛地站起身来，迅速敬了一个连最苛刻的上级都会满意的军礼。"长官，消灭使徒威胁是 NERV 的职责。我绝不会再在职责上失守。"

Fuyutsuki beamed at her. "Excellent, Captain. Pull this off, and I will see to it that Commander Ikari does not hear of this incident."
冬月向她微笑道：“很好，队长。若能成功，我会确保碇司令不会得知此事。”

Lowering her hand, Misato bowed low. "Thank you for this opportunity, sir."
放下手，葛城深深鞠了一躬。“感谢您给予这次机会，长官。”

"Dismissed." 解散。

Turning as if she were on parade, Misato headed for the briefing room door.
葛城转身如同在阅兵一般，朝着简报室的门走去。

"Oh, Captain?" “哦，队长？”

She stopped with one hand raised towards the door handle, twisting around to look inquisitively at the Sub-Commander.
她停下脚步，一只手伸向门把手，扭头好奇地望向副指挥官。

"You know that Commander Ikari was very reluctant to sign Ayanami over into your care," said Fuyutsuki. "Of course, then her apartment was destroyed during the Fifth Angel's attack, rendering your efforts in arguing your case mostly pointless as she needed a new home anyway. Even then it was it was only when I agreed with you that consolidating the pilots into one area would improve security that he agreed."
“你知道，碇司令当初极不情愿将绫波转交给你照顾，”冬月说道，“当然，后来她的公寓在第五使徒袭击中被毁，这使得你之前的争取大多变得无意义，因为她无论如何都需要一个新的住处。即便如此，也是直到我同意你的观点，认为将驾驶员集中在一处能提高安全性，他才勉强同意。”

He stared through Misato. "Consider yourself fortunate that he is away right now. I would not like to imagine what his reaction would be if he found out what happened so soon after she was placed in your care."
他透过目光凝视着葛城，“你该庆幸他现在不在。我难以想象，如果他得知她刚交给你照顾就出了事，会有什么反应。”

Misato cringed, but said nothing to the warning, simply saluting again before leaving the room. In the hallway on the other side of the door, she closed her eyes and leaned against the wall, sighing in relief that she hadn't been fired or imprisoned.
葛城缩了缩身子，对这番警告未作回应，只是再次敬礼后离开了房间。在门外的走廊上，她闭上眼睛，背靠墙壁，长舒一口气，庆幸自己没有被解雇或关押。

Yet.

"I take it you avoided the chopping block then."
看来你是躲过了那把斧头。

Her eyes shot open, glaring at the unexpected and somewhat unwelcome newcomer.
她双眼猛地睁开，怒视着这位突如其来且不甚受欢迎的不速之客。

"Kaji," she ground out through gritted teeth. "How nice of you to finally decide to show your face again."
卡吉，"她咬牙切齿地说道，"你终于决定露面了，真是太好了。

The unshaven agent winced exaggeratedly at her tone of voice. "Now is that any way to greet an old friend?"
那位胡子拉碴的特工夸张地皱了皱眉，对她的语气表示不满，"这样迎接老朋友，合适吗？"

Misato narrowed her eyes. "I don't know. Do old friends vanish at the first sign of trouble for weeks at a time?" she venomously asked.
碇真嗣眯起了眼睛。“我不知道。难道老朋友一遇到麻烦就消失好几个星期吗？”她恶狠狠地问道。

Kaji put a hand over his heart as if he had been shot. "Such hostility when I come bearing a gift."
加持将手放在心口，仿佛被击中了一般。“我带着礼物来，你却如此敌意。”

With a growl, Misato pushed past Kaji and stomped off down the corridor. "I have no time, nor am I in the mood for your stupid games," she said over her shoulder. "I'm a pilot down and I need to come up with a plan to kill this damn Angel, in case you hadn't realised."
碇真嗣低吼一声，推开加持，沿着走廊大步离去。“我没时间，也没心情陪你玩这些愚蠢的游戏，”她回头说道，“我有一个驾驶员缺席，我得想个办法干掉这个该死的使徒，如果你还没意识到的话。”

"What a coincidence. My gift could do just that."
“真是巧了。我的礼物恰好能派上用场。”

Misato halted abruptly, skidding slightly on the polished floor. It took several long moments of thought, debating whether she should just leave the insensitive jerk in her dust, before she gave in and turned around.
碇真嗣突然停下脚步，光滑的地板上略微打滑。她沉思良久，内心挣扎着是否该将那个无情的家伙抛在身后，最终还是转身回望。

"Fine," she snarled, stalking up to Kaji. "What's this brilliant plan of yours?"
好吧，"她咆哮着，大步走向加持。"你这高明的计划是什么？

XXX

"Well, I certainly do feel a little better now."
嗯，我现在确实感觉好点了。

Pausing with his spoon halfway to his mouth, Shinji smiled at Asuka before popping it into his mouth.
碇真嗣停下正要送入口中的勺子，对明日香微笑后才将其送进嘴里。

The stop at the grocery store had been fruitful. Regardless of his lack of taste, Shinji wanted to know if junk food's mystical properties would still work on him and had spent a chunk of money getting some, as well as a lesser amount on some staple foodstuff.
在杂货店的停留颇有收获。尽管对口味不甚讲究，真嗣还是想知道垃圾食品的神秘功效是否对他依然有效，于是花了不少钱买了一些，同时也买了些主食。

The first test with ice-cream certainly seemed to have helped. It definitely made the aching arms worth the effort of getting all that food home. At the very least, Asuka wasn't burning the house down with her laser glare. Instead, she was making an effort to clean her bowl after consuming a sizeable amount of chocolate and strawberry ice-cream. Eventually, the bowl clattered on the coffee table as Asuka leaned back in her chair and let out a sigh of satisfaction.
首次尝试冰淇淋确实有所助益。它无疑让搬运食物回家的酸痛手臂变得值得。至少，明日香没有用她那激光般的目光把房子烧毁。相反，她在吃了一大份巧克力和草莓冰淇淋后，正努力清洗自己的碗。最终，碗在咖啡桌上发出声响，明日香靠在椅背上，满意地叹了口气。

"You have some good ideas sometimes, Shinji," she remarked while patting her stomach.
“你有时候还真有点子，真嗣。”她拍着肚子说道。

"Thanks, Asuka." “谢谢你，明日香。”

Asuka sighed again. "I should have just gone along with your plan. Then we wouldn't have looked like idiots out there."
明日香又叹了口气。“我本该听从你的计划的。那样我们就不会在外面显得那么愚蠢了。”

Shinji blinked, then put down his bowl and spoon. "Well... considering what's been happening with the dual-sync plug, chances are we would have both decided to switch plans at the same time."
真嗣眨了眨眼，然后放下碗和勺子。“嗯……考虑到双同步插头的状况，我们俩很可能同时决定改变计划。”

Asuka snorted in amusement. "Yeah, I can see that happening. Like when two people try to walk past each other on the pavement; stepping in the same direction several times."
明日香嗤笑一声。“是啊，我能想象那场景。就像两个人在人行道上试图互相让路，结果却朝着同一个方向迈了好几次步。”

"There has to be something we can do about that," said Shinji. "As good as we did in the simulations, we're still different people."
“我们总得想个办法解决这个问题，”真嗣说。“尽管我们在模拟中表现出色，但我们终究是不同的人。”

"That's why I argued for letting us synchronise with each other in the plug," replied Asuka. "At that point we were one person in two bodies so we basically couldn't counteract each other."
所以当时我才主张让我们在插入栓内同步," 明日香回答道, "那时我们相当于一个人分成了两个身体,基本上无法相互抵消对方的影响.

Shinji nodded. "I understand, but I really don't like the idea of being out of action for days after each attack though. What if the Angels got smart and attacked quicker?"
真嗣点头道: "我明白,但我实在不喜欢每次攻击后都要瘫痪好几天.万一使徒变聪明了,加快攻击频率怎么办?"

Asuka punched the couch's armrest in frustration. "That's where it falls apart, damnit."
明日香懊恼地捶了一下沙发扶手, "问题就出在这儿,该死."

The two teenagers lapsed into silence for a few minutes. Shinji finished his bowl of mint-chocolate ice cream and placed it with Asuka's. While it didn't matter what the ice cream tasted like, since it wasn't made by her, he knew what it tasted like from a long time ago, and had simply recalled the taste as he ate. And even without the taste, the psychological effects were definitely still there.
两个少年沉默了几分钟. 真嗣吃完自己那碗薄荷巧克力冰淇淋,把它和明日香的放在一起. 虽然冰淇淋的味道并不重要,毕竟不是她做的,但他很久以前就尝过那种味道,吃的时候只是回忆起了那种滋味. 即便没有味道,心理上的影响肯定还是存在的.

"Hey Shinji," Asuka suddenly piped up. "Speaking of that synchronisation, I had this really weird dr-"
嘿，真嗣，"明日香突然插话道，"说到同步率，我刚才有个特别奇怪的梦——

A knock at the door cut off whatever Asuka was going to say.
一阵敲门声打断了明日香即将说出口的话。

"That could be Misato," said Shinji as he got up to answer the door.
"可能是美里，"真嗣说着起身去开门。

Sure enough, their guardian was on the other side of the door, carrying a plastic bag, but she didn't exactly look happy as Shinji invited her in. Just as he was about to close the door behind her, a hand shot out to grab it.
果然，他们的监护人站在门外，手里提着一个塑料袋，但她的表情并不像是高兴的样子，当真嗣请她进来时。就在他准备关门时，一只手突然伸出抓住了门。

"Hey, kiddo," greeted Kaji, earning a scowl from Misato.
"嘿，小家伙，" 薰打招呼道，惹得美里皱起了眉头。

Shinji looked back and forth between them, trying to work out what had caused Misato's bad mood. Kaji took the opportunity to slip in and follow Misato, who huffed and headed for the lounge room.
真嗣在他们之间来回看着，试图弄清楚是什么让美里心情不佳。薰趁机溜进去，跟着美里，后者哼了一声，朝客厅走去。

"Hello Misato," said Asuka. "How did things go?"
你好，美里，" 明日香说道。"事情进展如何？

As Shinji reached the lounge room, he saw Misato slouch over to their sofa and collapse onto it, staring at a disc in her hands.
当真嗣走进客厅时，他看到美里拖着沉重的步伐走向沙发，然后瘫坐上去，手里拿着一张光盘凝视着。

"Well, I have a plan that could work to defeat the Angel," said Misato, not taking her eyes off the disc even as Kaji sat down next to her. "Thing is, it's a bit... unorthodox." She looked at Shinji and Asuka. "I'm not sure how you two will react to it, but I can hazard a guess."
嗯，我有个计划，或许能击败那个使徒，" 葛城美里说道，目光未曾离开光盘，即便加持已经坐在她身旁。"问题是，这个计划有点……非同寻常。" 她看向真嗣和明日香。"我不确定你们俩会怎么反应，但我可以猜一猜。

"Us two?" Shinji echoed. "What about Rei? Is she...?"
我们俩？" 真嗣重复道。"那绫波呢？她……？

"Rei will be unavailable for this," Misato replied, her eyes shifty. "It will be entirely up to you two."
绫波这次无法参与，" 美里回答，眼神闪烁。"全靠你们俩了。

"That's going to be a bit difficult considering Shinji's handicap," Asuka reminded her, jerking a thumb in the boy's direction. "And since we can't synchronise as well now-"
考虑到真嗣的状况，这恐怕有点困难，" 明日香提醒她，用拇指指了指男孩。"而且我们现在同步率也大不如前——

"Actually, if this plan works out you'll be able to synchronise," Misato interrupted. "Well... sort of. Mostly. Not in the same way, but hopefully with similar positive results."
实际上，如果这个计划成功的话，你们就能同步了，" 葛城打断道，"嗯...算是吧。不完全一样，但希望能达到类似的积极效果。

The growing smirk on Kaji's face did nothing to ease Shinji's worries.
加持脸上越来越明显的坏笑，丝毫没有减轻真嗣的担忧。

"Well, stop beating around the bush," Asuka irritably said. "Tell us what this plan is."
好了，别绕弯子了，" 明日香不耐烦地说，"告诉我们这个计划是什么。

Misato's sour mood finally evaporated as she grinned, setting off warning bells in Shinji's head. He really didn't like that grin. It was the look of a woman who was about to get a lifetime's worth of blackmail and teasing material. And when she reached into the plastic bag and drew out two identical outfits...
葛城那阴郁的情绪终于消散，她咧嘴一笑，让真嗣心中警铃大作。他真的很不喜欢那个笑容。那是即将获得一生份量的敲诈和戏弄素材的女人的表情。而当她从塑料袋中掏出两套一模一样的服装时...

"You two are going to learn how to dance!" Misato announced.
"你们两个要学会跳舞！" 美里宣布道。

"Are you..." Asuka began.
"你这是..." 明日香开口道。

"...freaking..." Shinji continued.
"...在开玩笑..." 真嗣接着说。

"Joking?!" they shouted together.
"吗？！" 他们异口同声地喊道。

### Chapter 17 Israfel 2: Evangelion Boogaloo

"I really hate this." 我真的很讨厌这个。

"I know." 我知道。

"Misato is insane." 葛城小姐真是疯了。

"I know that too." 这个我也知道。

Asuka sighed heavily. The offensively loud outfits had been viciously balled up and hurled into a corner of the lounge room immediately after the departure of Misato and Kaji, followed by the disgruntled Second Child flopping onto the floor and glaring lasers up at the ceiling for the last half hour. To the great fortune of the two pilots, Misato hadn't insisted on starting immediately; the 'equipment hadn't arrived yet', whatever that meant.
明日香重重地叹了口气。那些刺眼的鲜艳服装在葛城和加持离开后，被狠狠地揉成一团扔到了客厅的角落里，紧接着，不满的二号机驾驶员便一头栽倒在地板上，用激光般的目光瞪着天花板，已经持续了半个小时。幸运的是，两位驾驶员，葛城并没有坚持立即开始；所谓的“设备还没到”，不管那是什么意思。

"You think this is gonna work?" she eventually asked.
"你觉得这招能行得通吗？" 她最终问道。

Shinji rested his head on his hand, leaning on the arm of the couch. Even after the two adults had explained the reasoning behind their plan, he was still sceptical. Not only would he be piloting his own Evangelion against 'Israfel', as NERV had taken to calling it, but he would also have to work perfectly in time with Asuka in Unit-02. While they had managed to do surprisingly well when piloting one Evangelion together, he just wasn't sure if this plan would work at getting them to synchronise while apart.
真嗣将头靠在手上，倚着沙发的扶手。尽管两位成年人已经解释了他们计划的缘由，他仍旧心存疑虑。他不仅要驾驶自己的 EVA 对抗被 NERV 称为“伊斯拉斐尔”的使徒，还必须与明日香在二号机中完美同步。虽然他们之前共同驾驶一台 EVA 时表现出色，但他不确定这个计划能否让他们在分开驾驶时达到同步。

Then again, maybe insane ideas were why Misato was NERV's Tactical Operations Officer.
或许，正是这种疯狂的想法，让美里成为了 NERV 的战术行动官。

"I'm sure they would have thought of something more... conventional if it would have worked," he finally remarked. "That they've come up with... this... really says something about what they think the Angel is capable of."
如果常规方法有效，我相信他们会考虑更传统的策略，" 他最终评论道，"他们提出这样的方案，足以说明他们对使徒能力的评估有多严峻。

"Too bad we only get a plan after humiliating ourselves in front of the JSSDF," Asuka grumbled. "Who then had to bail our asses out with an N2 mine."
真倒霉，我们得先在自卫队面前丢尽脸面，才有计划，" 明日香抱怨道，"然后还得靠 N2 地雷来救场。

"At least we're alive," Shinji rejoined. "Dead people don't learn from their mistakes."
至少我们还活着，" 真嗣反驳说，"死人是不会从错误中学习的。

"I suppose." Asuka suddenly flipped herself to her feet and headed over to the corner where the discarded outfits sat. "Well... which do you prefer? Eye-bleeding green or retina-searing pink?"
我想也是。" 明日香突然翻身站起，朝角落里堆放的废弃服装走去。"那么... 你更喜欢哪个？刺眼的绿色还是炫目的粉色？

Shinji stared at the abominable pile for a moment, before a thought occurred. "Why don't we just use our regular exercise clothing?"
真嗣盯着那堆令人不快的衣物看了一会儿，突然灵光一闪。"我们为什么不直接穿平时的运动服呢？"

Asuka spun around slowly, a grin on her face. "Good thinking. Makes me wonder why Misato bought these damn things in the first place."
明日香缓缓转过身，脸上挂着一抹坏笑。“想得挺周到嘛。我倒好奇，为什么美里当初要买这些破玩意儿。”

"That's an easy one." “这问题简单。”

"Oh?" Asuka quirked an eyebrow at him. "You think you can get into the mind of our guardian so easily?"
“哦？”明日香挑眉看向他，“你以为你能轻易看透我们监护人的心思？”

"I don't need to. It's Misato. All she wanted was to see the look on our faces."
“我不需要。那是美里。她无非就是想看我们惊讶的表情罢了。”

"...Damn her." ...该死。

TIME REMAINING: 161 HOURS
剩余时间：161 小时

The rest of the day went by all too quickly. The instant Shinji woke up the next morning and remembered what was due to happen for the next week he let out a loud groan, wishing for nothing more than being able to burrow into his bed and hide.
那天余下的时光飞逝而过。第二天一早，真嗣一醒来就记起了接下来一周即将发生的事，不禁发出一声长叹，恨不得能钻进被窝里躲起来。

Unfortunately, pulling the sheet over his head did nothing to block out Misato's obnoxiously loud morning greeting when she banged her hand on something in the kitchen, probably the table.
可惜，把床单蒙在头上丝毫挡不住美里那刺耳的早晨问候声，她用力拍打着厨房里的什么东西，大概是桌子。

"Time to wake up! I don't have a bugle so just pretend I'm blowing one as loud as possible!"
该起床啦！我没有号角，就假装我正吹得震天响吧！

Amid her shouting, Shinji debated the merits of trying to sneak out to the balcony, scaling down the side of the apartment building, picking up Kensuke and running off to live in the wild. He'd just gotten to the point where he'd have to learn how to make a rudimentary bow when his bedroom door was slammed open.
在她的大喊声中，真嗣权衡着偷偷溜到阳台，顺着公寓外墙爬下去，接上健介然后逃到野外生活的利弊。他刚想到得学会制作简易弓箭那一步，卧室门就被砰地一声推开了。

"Up you get, Shinji!" 起来吧，真嗣！

"Uuuggghhhh." 呃呃呃呃呃。

Fifteen minutes later, freshly showered and kitted out in his exercise clothes, Shinji joined Asuka and Misato at the kitchen table. Whatever had happened yesterday was still affecting Misato's mood, and was likely responsible for the worse-than-usual hangover she clearly had. Shinji debated asking about what had caused Misato to drink herself to sleep, but the woman seemed rather grouchy.
十五分钟后，洗完澡换上运动装的真嗣，与明日香和美里一同坐在餐桌旁。昨天的什么事显然还在影响着美里的情绪，她那比平时更严重的宿醉也多半与此有关。真嗣犹豫着是否要询问是什么让美里喝到醉倒，但这位女士看起来相当暴躁。

When Misato realised that they weren't going to wear the hideous costumes she had brought, the grumpy look on her face almost made the upcoming week worthwhile.
当美里意识到他们不会穿上她带来的那套丑陋服装时，她脸上那副不悦的表情几乎让接下来的一周都显得值得期待了。

After a quick breakfast courtesy of Asuka, who was now wearing her hair in a ponytail, the trio headed to the lounge room. Shinji halted upon seeing the machine set up where their television had once sat, but Asuka, having seen it already due to her bedroom being nearby, simply walked up to it. The entire lounge room had been cleared, everything pushed to the walls, to make room for... whatever this was.
在明日香快速准备的早餐后，她现在扎起了马尾，三人前往客厅。真嗣一看到原本放电视的地方被一台机器占据就停下了脚步，而明日香因为卧室就在附近已经见过，便径直走了过去。整个客厅被清空，所有东西都被推到墙边，为的就是腾出空间给...这个不知是什么的东西。

"So we're going to be using this... thing?" Asuka wondered aloud, sounding like she was talking about a dead animal.
"所以我们是要用这个...玩意儿？" 明日香大声问道，语气仿佛在谈论一只死去的动物。

"Are those... dance mats?" Shinji asked.
"那些是...跳舞毯吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Of course. How else are you two going to learn how to dance in sync?" Misato replied. She stepped between them and moved to stand next to the machine. "This plan will require absolute precision. The two of you must be able to learn how to predict what the other is going to do. I know you were able to do that in the dual-sync plug tests, but since you both reacted differently in actual combat, you'll need to learn how to work with each other without being linked."
当然是。不然你们俩怎么学会同步跳舞呢？" 美里回答道。她走到他们中间，移步至机器旁。"这个计划需要绝对的精确。你们俩必须学会预测对方的动作。我知道你们在双同步插头测试中能做到这一点，但在实际战斗中你们的反应不同，所以你们需要学会在不连接的情况下相互配合。

Misato turned a serious expression upon her two wards. "You have a week. For the next seven days, the two of you are going to be training together in all things."
美里用严肃的表情看着她的两个监护对象。"你们有一周时间。接下来的七天里，你们俩将一起训练所有事情。"

"Um... pardon?" asked a puzzled Shinji.
"嗯... 抱歉，你说什么？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"All. Things." Misato repeated. "You will learn the dance together. You will eat and sleep together-"
所有。事物。" 碇真嗣重复道。"你们将一起学习舞蹈。你们将一起吃饭和睡觉——

"Excuse me?!" Asuka shrieked, making Misato reflexively bring a hand up to her ear. "We may be friends but I am not going that far!"
你说什么?!" 明日香尖叫道，让美里本能地用手捂住耳朵。"我们可能是朋友，但我不会做到那种程度！

Misato's head dropped, and the hand at her ear moved to her forehead. "Not like that, Asuka. The two of you will still be in separate beds, but you're going to be sleeping next to each other here in the lounge." She gave Asuka a pointed look. "I could choose to sleep here as well, just to make sure of that, but I'm choosing to believe you will be fine without my supervision. Correct?"
美里的头低了下来，捂住耳朵的手移到了额头上。"不是那样的，明日香。你们俩还是会睡在各自的床上，但你们将在这里的休息室挨着睡。" 她向明日香投去一个意味深长的眼神。"我也可以选择睡在这里，只是为了确保这一点，但我选择相信你们在没有我监督的情况下也会没事。对吧？"

Shinji glanced at Asuka, who shrugged and said, "Sure, I guess. Although if it weren't for this training I'd be fighting that order."
真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，后者耸了耸肩说："好吧，我想是的。如果不是因为这次训练，我肯定会反对这个命令。"

Misato humphed and continued. "Anyway, obviously you won't actually be bathing together either. But you will do everything else together. Just be fortunate that those exercise clothes complement each other, or I'd be forcing you into what I picked." Her eyes darted to a certain corner of the room, and she gave Asuka and Shinji a sly grin; the first sign of the 'regular' Misato that morning. "Maybe I should have them as a punishment hanging over your heads if you don't do well."
葛城美里哼了一声，继续说道：“总之，显然你们也不会真的共浴。但其他事情都要一起做。庆幸你们的运动服还算搭配吧，不然我可就要逼你们穿我挑的了。”她的目光扫向房间的一角，对着明日香和真嗣狡黠一笑；这是那天早上她第一次露出“常态”的葛城美里。“或许我该把这当作惩罚，要是你们表现不好，就等着穿吧。”

"Yeah, good luck with that," Asuka said offhandedly as she strode over to the dance machine. She picked up a set of headphones laying nearby and experimentally put them over her ears. After a moment spent adjusting them, she took them off and asked, "So how exactly does this thing work?"
“嗯，祝你好运，”明日香漫不经心地说着，大步走向跳舞机。她捡起旁边的一副耳机，试着戴在耳朵上。调整了一会儿后，她摘下耳机问道：“这玩意儿到底怎么用？”

"Well since you need to dance in sync, this machine is going to train you to do just that," replied Misato. "Each of you will be on one of the pads, performing these dance moves." She picked up two sheets of paper from the coffee table sitting against the wall and passed them to Asuka and Shinji. "Here. Memorise them."
“既然需要同步跳舞，这台机器就是训练你们做到这一点，”葛城美里回答。“你们俩各站在一个垫子上，做这些舞蹈动作。”她从靠墙的咖啡桌上拿起两张纸，递给明日香和真嗣。“给，记下来。”

Shinji looked at his sheet. There were arrows and other shapes on it, and he glanced at the mat to see the corresponding symbols.
真嗣看着自己的图纸，上面有箭头和其他形状，他瞥了一眼垫子，寻找对应的符号。

"The moves will be perfectly in time with the music that will be playing through those headphones. That music will also be playing in your entry plugs when the time comes to fight Israfel. Oh, by the way?" Misato got their attention from where she was now standing at the doorway to the lounge room. "The machine is tuned so that you'll need to do the moves within a thousandth of a second of each other. Good luck!"
动作将与耳机中播放的音乐完美同步。当战斗伊斯拉斐尔的时刻到来时，那音乐也会在你们的插入栓中响起。哦，顺便说一句？" 美里从休息室的门口站起身来，吸引了他们的注意。"这台机器已经调校过，你们需要在一千分之一秒内同步完成动作。祝好运！

She ran off before Asuka or Shinji could retort. Asuka glowered at the fleeing woman's back.
她跑开了，没等明日香或真嗣反驳。明日香怒视着那女人逃离的背影。

"This is going to be fun..."
这肯定会很有趣……

TIME REMAINING: 151 HOURS
剩余时间：151 小时

It was hell. 那简直是地狱。

Even by dinner time, Shinji wasn't a hundred percent sure he had fully memorised the moves. Asuka had, naturally, learned them perfectly in only a couple of hours. Fortunately for the two of them, after lunch Asuka found a way to turn down the alarm that shrieked every time Shinji stumbled or forgot a move, stopping the entire routine and forcing them to start over. She also discovered how to adjust the timing precision of the steps to give Shinji just a little more breathing room as he fumbled his way through them; an event for which he was extremely grateful.
直到晚餐时分，真嗣仍不敢百分百确定自己已完全记住了舞步。而明日香自然只用了几个小时就完美掌握了。幸运的是，午餐后明日香找到了关闭警报的方法，每当真嗣出错或忘记动作时，那刺耳的警报就会响起，打断整个练习并迫使他们从头开始。她还发现可以调整舞步的计时精度，给真嗣在摸索中多一点喘息的空间；对此他感激不尽。

But that didn't stop Shinji from flailing like a semaphore flag man on the first day.
但这并未阻止真嗣在第一天像信号旗手一样手忙脚乱。

"Sorry Asuka," he apologised over dinner. "I just don't seem to be very coordinated."
对不起，明日香，" 他在晚餐时道歉道，"我好像就是协调性不太好。

"Don't apologise," Asuka sighed. "You weren't brought up like I was. I'm not expecting you to be able to do ballet. That said..." She gave him a look. "You will do better tomorrow. Do I make myself clear?"
不用道歉，" 明日香叹了口气，"你和我成长的环境不同。我不指望你能跳芭蕾。不过……" 她瞥了他一眼，"你明天得做得更好。我说清楚了吗？

Nervously, Shinji nodded.
真嗣紧张地点了点头。

"Good. And don't get complacent about the timing," she warned as they continued to eat. "I'm going to be re-adjusting the precision the moment I see you doing better."
好。还有，别对时间掌握掉以轻心，" 她警告说，两人继续用餐，"一旦我发现你有所进步的迹象，我会立刻调整精确度。

Shinji, mouth full of food, simply nodded again.
真嗣嘴里塞满了食物，只是再次点了点头。

TIME REMAINING: 139 HOURS

Day two of the training regimen came, and Shinji was naturally puzzled when he woke up to an unfamiliar ceiling. Then his brain remembered to wake up and remind him of the rules of the training week. A couple feet away, Asuka grumbled into wakefulness. Without a word spoken between them, Asuka headed for the bathroom while Shinji prepared what he could of their morning meal.
训练计划的第二天来临，真嗣醒来时看到陌生的天花板，自然感到困惑。随后，他的大脑记起了要醒来并提醒他训练周的规则。几英尺外，明日香嘟囔着醒来。两人之间没有言语交流，明日香径直走向浴室，而真嗣则着手准备他们的早餐。

After breakfast Misato came into their apartment, looking somewhat hungover again but evidently still perfectly capable of assessing their progress. As was to be expected she wasn't happy about Asuka's modifications and practically demanded that Shinji shape up quickly, or end up having to wear the dreaded costumes. Asuka defended him, stating that he was already well ahead of what she had originally expected of him.
早餐后，美里走进他们的公寓，看起来又有些宿醉，但显然仍能准确评估他们的进展。不出所料，她对明日香的改动并不满意，几乎要求真嗣迅速改进，否则就得穿上那令人畏惧的服装。明日香为他辩护，声称他已远超她最初的预期。

Shinji didn't know whether to feel relieved at her defense, or insulted that she initially thought so little of him.
真嗣不知道是该对她为自己辩护感到宽慰，还是该为她最初如此轻视自己而感到受辱。

Misato left for NERV after a few hours, promising to be back after dinner and that if the machine wasn't set back to its original parameters, she would carry out her threat.
几个小时后，美里前往 NERV，承诺晚饭后回来，并警告说如果机器没有恢复到原始参数，她会履行她的威胁。

Thankfully for all involved, Shinji finally found his feet. Mostly.
所幸，涉及此事的每个人都松了口气，因为真嗣终于站稳了脚跟。基本上算是。

TIME REMAINING: 59 HOURS 剩余时间：59 小时

"Hey, Class Rep. Didn't expect to see you here too."
嘿，班长。没想到你也在这儿。

Hikari jumped a little, gasping slightly at the surprise voice behind her. She'd been so focused on the changing number above the elevator that she hadn't been paying attention to her surroundings. She turned around to see...
光吓了一跳，身后突然传来的声音让她微微喘息。她一直全神贯注地盯着电梯上方变化的数字，完全没留意周围的情况。她转过身去，只见...

"Suzuhara. Aida. Are you two here to see Ikari and Soryu?"
铃原。相田。你们俩是来看碇和索尔的吗？

Toji nodded. "Yeah. Considerin' they ain't been at school for a few days, me 'n Ken wanted to know if somethin' was up with them."
冬二点了点头。"对。看他们好几天没来学校了，我和健想知道他们是不是有什么事。"

"We haven't seen a hint of them ever since that last attack," Kensuke added. "I'm wondering if they got hurt."
自从那次袭击后，我们连他们的影子都没见到过，" 健介补充道，"我在想，他们会不会受伤了。

Hikari put a hand over her mouth in shock. "Oh no. Should we have tried to visit them at the hospital?"
光用手捂住嘴巴，震惊地说："哦不，我们应该去医院探望他们吗？"

Kensuke scoffed. "Do you really want to try and get into the Geofront, the most heavily guarded place in Japan? Besides, they only might be hurt. They're most likely just fine and busy with something."
健介嗤之以鼻，"你真想尝试进入日本守卫最森严的第三新东京市地底都市？再说了，他们可能只是受了点伤。他们多半没事，正忙着处理其他事情呢。"

Hikari collected herself. "Oh... of course. You're right." She cleared her throat as the elevator doors opened, trying to pretend the last few seconds hadn't happened. "Well... shall we head up?"
光整理了一下情绪，"哦...当然，你说得对。" 她清了清嗓子，电梯门打开时，试图装作刚才那几秒钟的事情没有发生过，"那么...我们上去吧？"

The elevator wasn't very big, just barely fitting all three teenagers standing line abreast, but at least it was quick. The door opened onto the seventh floor, and the boys let Hikari exit first. They proceeded down the hallway, more of the black-suited Section Two agents glancing at them as they passed by. Kensuke saluted them to no response.
电梯并不宽敞，勉强容纳下并排站立的三位少年，但至少速度很快。门一开便是七楼，男孩们让光先行。他们沿着走廊前行，更多身着黑衣的第二部门特工在他们经过时投来目光。健介向他们敬礼，却未得到回应。

It had been rather harrowing for Hikari, trying to explain to a large bald man in the foyer of the building that she wanted to visit her friends. Right up until the very last second she had been sure that the man would simply refuse and kick her back out to the sidewalk. Now she was quickly striding past the doors along the balcony, glancing at the numbers, before stopping in front of the one labelled '706' and pressing the buzzer next to the door.
对于光来说，向大楼门厅里那位魁梧的光头男子解释自己想要探望朋友的过程颇为煎熬。直到最后一刻，她都确信那人会直接拒绝并将她赶回人行道上。此刻，她正快步走过阳台旁的门，边走边看门牌号，最终停在标有“706”的门前，按下了旁边的门铃。

"Man, still can't believe Shin-man actually lives with Red," Toji muttered as he and Kensuke caught up to Hikari. Kensuke snickered into his hand, but before Hikari could interrogate him on the apparent joke, her ears picked up what sounded like muffled but very heavy footfalls as someone made their way to the door. Assuming it to be Asuka in a grouchy mood, Hikari prepared to act as a mediator.
“真是难以置信，真嗣居然和红住在一起。”当东治和健介赶上光时，东治嘟囔道。健介捂嘴窃笑，但光还未来得及追问这显然的笑话，她的耳朵就捕捉到了像是有人沉重而急促地走向门口的闷响。猜想是明日香心情不佳，光准备充当调解者。

The door slid open. 门悄然滑开。

"Good after- Oh hey, it's you guys."
下午好——哦，是你们啊。

Hikari blinked, her eyes darting between the two residents of the apartment standing in front of her. They were definitely Asuka and Shinji, for some reason dressed like they were about to go jogging, but she could have sworn...
光眨了眨眼，目光在站在她面前的两位公寓居民之间来回游移。他们无疑是明日香和真嗣，不知为何穿着像是准备去慢跑的衣服，但她敢肯定……

"Ah, where are our manners?" The two pilots stepped aside. "Come on in!"
哎呀，我们真是失礼了。"两位驾驶员侧身让开。"快请进！

Slowly turning her head to her right, Hikari saw that Toji and Kensuke were just as stunned as she was. Toji broke out of his daze first, shaking his head in disbelief before nodding a greeting at Shinji and Asuka as he slipped past them into the apartment, dragging Kensuke by the shoulder.
缓缓将头转向右侧，光发现东治和健介同样目瞪口呆。东治最先回过神来，难以置信地摇了摇头，随后向真嗣和明日香点头致意，便拉着健介的肩膀，从他们身边溜进了公寓。

"Is something wrong, Horaki?"
有什么事吗，堀崎？

Yes. They were definitely talking at the same time.
是的。他们确实是在同时说话。

A few minutes later Hikari found herself in the lounge room, sitting on their sofa with a glass of juice in her hands, watching the strange synchronous dance Shinji and Asuka were performing. They weren't perfect, Shinji tending to lose his balance a little after bending to touch one of the symbols on his mat, but it was surprising to see them work so well together.
几分钟后，光发现自己坐在客厅的沙发上，手里端着一杯果汁，看着真嗣和明日香正在进行一场奇特的同步舞蹈。他们的动作并不完美，真嗣在弯腰触碰垫子上的符号后，往往会有些失去平衡，但令人惊讶的是，他们能如此默契地合作。

It was a little reassuring that they had stopped talking at the same time.
他们同时停止交谈，这多少让人感到一丝安心。

After what she had just witnessed at the door, even the presence of a penguin in their apartment wasn't enough to faze Hikari now. She only stared at it for a few seconds as it made itself comfortable on the armrest next to her, before returning her attention to the machine as an alarm went off.
经历了刚才在门口目睹的那一幕，即便此刻公寓里出现一只企鹅，也已不足以让光感到惊讶。她只是盯着那只企鹅几秒钟，看着它在她旁边的扶手上安顿下来，随后便将注意力转回到那台发出警报的机器上。

Asuka growled and put a hand to her forehead. "Come on, Shinji. Why do you keep messing up at this bit? We've been trying all damn day!"
明日香低吼一声，用手捂住额头。“拜托，真嗣，你怎么总是在这一步出错？我们一整天都在尝试！”

"I-I don't know!" Shinji stammered. "I'm positive I'm doing it right..."
“我、我也不知道！”真嗣结巴着说，“我确信我做的是对的……”

"It's not even a difficult part! It's just step-pause-turn-pause-pivot-step-pause!"
这甚至不是什么难的部分！就是一步-停顿-转身-停顿-旋转-一步-停顿！

"Er..." Shinji looked non-plussed. "I thought it was step-pause-turn-pause-pivot-step-step..."
呃..." 真嗣看起来有些不知所措。"我以为是一步-停顿-转身-停顿-旋转-一步-一步...

"Of course it isn't! That's why you're getting it wrong!"
当然不是！所以你才会做错！

"Actually... it is." 实际上... 确实是这样。

As one, Shinji and Asuka turned to look at Kensuke, who was holding up one of the dance note sheets. "If I'm reading it right, it says step-pause-turn-pause-pivot-step-step."
几乎是同时，真嗣和明日香转向了手拿一张舞步笔记的剑介。“如果我没看错的话，上面写着‘踏步-停顿-转身-停顿-旋转-踏步-踏步’。”

Asuka stomped over to him, snatching the paper out of his hands. "Which obviously means you're not reading it right, you..." She trailed off as her eyes darted over the sheet. The next words out of her mouth were in German, but Hikari was positive that they weren't supposed to be uttered in polite company. "How the hell did I manage to forget this?!"
明日香大步走过去，一把从他手中夺过纸张。“显然你没看对，你……”她话没说完，目光扫过纸面。接下来她用德语说的话，尽管光听不懂，但肯定不是什么适合在礼貌场合说的话。“我怎么就把这个给忘了？！”

"It's okay, Asuka," Shinji said in a conciliatory tone. "We've been at this for four days now, and our friends are here. Surely Misato wouldn't begrudge us a little break."
“没事的，明日香，”真嗣用一种和解的语气说道，“我们已经练了四天了，现在朋友们也在。美里肯定不会介意我们稍微休息一下的。”

Asuka rubbed the bridge of her nose, inhaling deeply before letting it out in a groaning sigh. "Fine..." she muttered. "I've only been screwing up for the last damn hour..."
明日香揉了揉鼻梁，深吸一口气后，带着呻吟声叹了出来。“好吧……”她嘟囔着，“我他妈的已经搞砸了整整一个小时了……”

Since their friends -and the penguin- had the sofa, Asuka chose to simply flop down on the floor, Shinji sitting down next to her the same way. Hikari was about to offer her spot, and insist that Toji or Kensuke get up as well, but Asuka seemed to read her thoughts, looking directly at Hikari and shaking her head before laying back and resting it on her hands. Desperate to fill the awkward silence, Hikari clung onto an obvious conversation topic. "So... what exactly is this training for?" she asked, before taking a big sip from her glass.
由于朋友们——还有那只企鹅——占据了沙发，明日香索性直接瘫坐在地板上，真嗣也以同样的方式坐在她旁边。光正要提出让座，并坚持让东治或剑介起身，但明日香似乎看穿了她的想法，直视着光并摇头，随后躺下，将头枕在双手上。为了打破这尴尬的沉默，光紧抓着一个显而易见的话题：“那么……这训练究竟是为了什么？”她问道，随即大口喝了一口杯中的饮料。

Shinji suddenly looked pensive. "...I don't know if we're allowed to tell you."
真嗣突然显得若有所思。“……我不知道我们是否被允许告诉你们。”

"Ugh. Do you really believe NERV would care about something like this getting out?" Asuka interjected. "It's hardly a secret weapon."
“哎呀。你们真的认为 NERV 会在意这种事情泄露出去吗？”明日香插话道，“这又不是什么秘密武器。”

"Depending on what you're fighting, it could be," said Kensuke, suddenly looking thoughtful.
“那要看你对抗的是什么了，它可能就是。”剑介突然若有所思地说。

"Eh." Asuka dismissively waved a hand. "May as well tell you anyway."
唉。" 明日香不屑地挥了挥手，"反正告诉你也无妨。

The story of the disastrous first attack on Israfel came out. Fortunately for Hikari's sanity, Asuka and Shinji didn't speak at the same time. However, they would instead pick up where the other left off, sometimes alternating who was speaking every sentence. It may not have been simultaneous, but it still somewhat unnerved Hikari.
关于第一次攻击伊斯拉斐尔失败的灾难性故事被娓娓道来。幸好，对于光的心理承受能力来说，明日香和真嗣并没有同时说话。相反，他们会接过对方的话茬，有时每句话轮流由不同的人说。虽然不是同时说话，但这仍然让光感到有些不安。

"Defeating an Angel through the power of synchronised dance?" Kensuke chortled. "Tell me you're going to stop the next one through disco!"
通过同步舞蹈的力量击败天使？" 健介咯咯笑道，"告诉我，你们下次要用迪斯科来阻止下一个天使！

Toji piped up, barely trying not to openly grin. "Nah, man, they're gonna kill it with the power of love!"
东治插话进来，努力不让自己明显地笑出声，"得了吧，哥们，他们要用爱的力量来消灭它！"

The two boys began to cackle, throwing out even more absurd ideas until Hikari glared them into submission. She then drank the rest of the juice and made to put the empty glass on the table, but a clawed flipper popped up in front of her face. She stared dumbly at it for a moment, before looking to her left at the penguin. It seemed to be asking her to pass it the glass. Hesitantly, she passed it to the penguin, who took it and hopped off the armrest, waddling into the kitchen.
两个男孩开始咯咯笑起来，抛出更加荒谬的想法，直到光用眼神将他们瞪得服服帖帖。她随即喝完了剩下的果汁，正要把空杯子放在桌上，突然一只带爪的鳍状肢出现在她面前。她愣愣地盯着它看了一会儿，然后向左看向那只企鹅。它似乎在向她索要杯子。她犹豫了一下，把杯子递给了企鹅，后者接过杯子，从扶手上跳下来，摇摇摆摆地走进了厨房。

"Um..." She glanced at Shinji and Asuka. "Is... that penguin a housemate?"
呃..." 她瞥了一眼真嗣和明日香。"那...那只企鹅是室友吗？

"Pen-pen lives next door with Misato and Rei," Shinji replied. "Honestly, I'm not even sure how he got in here without knocking, but I've given up trying to work him out. He reads the newspaper."
企鹅潘潘和美里还有丽住在隔壁，" 真嗣回答道。"说实话，我都不清楚它是怎么没敲门就进来的，但我已经放弃去理解它了。它还会看报纸。

"Ain't penguins arctic creatures?" Toji wondered, clearly choosing not to question how an animal could read. "How is it able to live in this sweaty armpit of a country?"
企鹅不是北极的动物吗？" 东治疑惑道，显然选择不去质疑一只动物怎么可能会阅读。"它怎么能在这个闷热得像腋下的国家生活呢？

"Antarctic, but good try," Asuka corrected. "Anyway, Pen-pen's a genetic engineering experiment. He was gonna get euthanized afterwards but Misato took him in."
南极的，不过算你猜得不错，" 明日香纠正道。"总之，Pen-pen 是基因工程的实验品。本来是要被安乐死的，但后来被美里收养了。

The bird in question returned, holding a can of soda in one hand and a fresh glass of juice in the other. He passed the juice to Hikari, who gave him her surprised thanks, then hopped back up to the armrest before popping the soda can open.
那只鸟儿回来了，一手拿着一罐汽水，另一手端着一杯新鲜的果汁。它把果汁递给光，光惊讶地道了谢，然后它又跳回到扶手上，啪的一声打开了汽水罐。

Toji turned a disbelieving look on Shinji and Asuka as he pointed at Pen-pen. No words were needed, and none were forthcoming from the pilots.
东治难以置信地看向真嗣和明日香，指着 Pen-pen。无需言语，两位驾驶员也没有开口。

Eventually, it came to be time for the guests to head home. Pen-pen was close on Hikari's heels as she headed for the front door. When she turned to wave goodbye to her friends, the penguin seemed to be waving rather enthusiastically. Walking to the elevator, Hikari wondered if she had just picked up a new, avian friend.
终于，到了客人们该回家的时候。Pen-pen 紧跟在光后面，一起走向前门。当她转身向朋友们挥手告别时，那只企鹅似乎也在热情地挥着翅膀。走向电梯的路上，光不禁思索，自己是不是刚刚结交了一个新的鸟类朋友。

TIME REMAINING: 15 HOURS 剩余时间：15 小时

It was the afternoon of the last day of training. Misato was sitting on the couch, while Shinji and Asuka were preparing to show her how far they had come. Already, she could see that they were very well synchronised even as they were warming up. To the naked eye, the two teenagers appeared to be doing their stretches at exactly the same time. When they were ready, they bowed as one to Misato, then put their headphones on simultaneously. As they waited to start, Shinji and Asuka even began bouncing on the balls of their feet together.
那是训练的最后一天下午。美里坐在沙发上，而真嗣和明日香正准备向她展示他们的进步。她已经可以看出，即使在热身时，两人的同步率也非常高。从肉眼看来，这两个少年少女仿佛在同一时刻做着拉伸运动。准备就绪后，他们齐刷刷地向美里鞠了一躬，然后同时戴上耳机。等待开始时，真嗣和明日香甚至开始一起在脚尖上弹跳。

And then the music started.
接着，音乐响起。

Sixty-three seconds later, Misato stood up from the couch and applauded, cheering as if she had just watched a concert. She even briefly considered asking for an encore, but then she remembered that that would be happening tomorrow on a grander scale and decided to wait.
六十三秒后，美里从沙发上站起来鼓掌欢呼，仿佛刚听完一场音乐会。她甚至短暂地考虑过要求再来一次，但随即想起明天将以更宏大的规模上演，便决定耐心等待。

"Excellent work, you two!" she said. "That Angel won't know what hit it!"
干得好，你们俩！"她说，"那只使徒肯定不知道自己是怎么被打败的！

"Of course it won't!" Asuka and Shinji said together. "We didn't spend a week on this just to lose again!"
那当然不会了！"明日香和真嗣异口同声地说，"我们可不是白白训练了一周，就为了再次失败！

Misato blinked, then sighed good-naturedly. "You're doing that on purpose now, aren't you?"
美里眨了眨眼，然后好脾气地叹了口气，"你们现在是在故意逗我吧，是不是？"

The two teenagers glanced at each other, then back at her with a grin. "Maybe."
两个少年相视一笑，又转向她，脸上挂着调皮的笑容，"或许吧。"

With a snort, Misato headed for the kitchen. "Since you did so well, I'll shout you some takeaway for dinner. What do you want?"
哼了一声，葛城美里朝厨房走去。“既然你表现这么好，今晚的晚餐我请客，叫外卖。你想吃什么？”

"Uh..." “呃……”

"Pizza Diavolo!" “魔鬼披萨！”

Halting in the doorway, Misato glanced over her shoulder at them. "Heh, guess you're still not that in tune with each other after all."
在门口停下脚步，葛城美里回头瞥了他们一眼。“呵，看来你们终究还是不够默契啊。”

"...Well we're still two different people," said Asuka, after taking a second to mock scowl at Shinji. "Besides, Shinji can't taste anything I haven't prepared for him so of course he doesn't have a take-out preference."
...毕竟我们还是两个不同的人，" 明日香说着，故意朝真嗣皱了皱眉。"再说，真嗣吃的东西都是我准备好的，他当然没有叫外卖的偏好。

"I guess not. Well how about I order in Shinji's place, and we have your suggestion tomorrow, Asuka?"
我想也是。那不如我替真嗣做主，明天就按你的建议来，明日香？

"Sure," the teenagers agreed together.
"没问题，" 两位少年异口同声地答应。

Misato smiled at the two of them, before turning to leave. "Yep, tomorrow you're going to kick that Angel's ass."
美里对两人微微一笑，随后转身离开。"对，明天你们一定要把那使徒打得落花流水。"

XXX

SEPTEMBER 11, 2015. TIME REMAINING: -0.5 HOURS

"You really kicked that Angel's ass."
你真把那使徒打得落花流水。

Shinji groaned, somewhat muffled by the fact that he was slumped over in his chair face down on the table in the briefing room. The tone of Misato's voice was clearly that of a happy and impressed superior who had expected much from her charges and got what she wanted. Not that he could blame her; the plan had gone off without a hitch.
真嗣发出一声呻吟，声音有些闷，因为他正趴在简报室的桌子上，脸朝下埋在双臂间。美里说话的语气明显带着喜悦和赞赏，作为上司，她对部下寄予厚望，而他们也确实不负所望。真嗣倒也不怪她；整个计划执行得天衣无缝。

"Yes. I must say that was a rather impressive performance out there."
是的。我得说，你在外面的表现相当出色。

But that didn't stop Shinji feeling so exhausted he could barely lift his head to look at Misato or Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, or even watch the recorded footage of two Evangelions performing an incredible feat of synchronised fighting, slaying their opponents in a little over a minute.
但这并未阻止真嗣感到极度疲惫，以至于他几乎抬不起头来看美里或副司令冬月，更不用说观看两台福音战士同步作战的惊人录像，它们仅用了一分多钟就击败了对手。

"Adrenaline's worn off, huh?" Misato remarked, sitting down opposite the tired boy. "And I suppose you did do a hell of a lot in a short time this week."
肾上腺素消退了，是吧？" 美里说着，坐在疲惫的少年对面。"我想你这周确实在短时间内做了很多事情。

"Oh, he'll be wide awake at dinner time," Asuka piped up. "Considering what we'll be eating then."
哦，到晚饭时间他肯定会精神抖擞的，" 明日香插话道。"考虑到我们那时要吃的东西。

Shinji blinked slowly, turning his head to glance at her. "What was it you wanted? Pizza diablo?"
真嗣缓缓眨眼，转头瞥了她一眼。"你想要的是什么来着？魔鬼披萨？"

"Close. It's 'Diavolo'," Asuka corrected. She paused, casting a thoughtful look at Misato. "Are there actually any pizza places here in Tokyo-3? I probably should have found that out before making my request."
接近了。是'魔鬼风味'，" 明日香纠正道。她停顿了一下，若有所思地看了看美里。"东京-3 这里真的有披萨店吗？我可能应该在提出要求前先查清楚。

"I already looked into that," Misato replied. "Lucky for you, there's a couple pizza places that decided to take the risk of setting up in a combat zone. And one of them does do Diavolo."
我已经调查过了，" 美里回答。"你运气不错，有几家披萨店决定冒险在战区开店。其中一家确实有魔鬼风味披萨。

Shinji looked up just in time to see her give what could only be a sadistic grin. "Um... whatever you're thinking, Misato, it's probably not going to happen," he said, before pointing at his mouth. "Taste problems, remember?"
真嗣抬头正好看到她露出一个只能被形容为残忍的笑容。"呃... 美里，无论你在想什么，它可能都不会发生，" 他说着，指了指自己的嘴巴。"味觉问题，记得吗？"

Misato's face fell as Shinji's comment took the wind out of her sails. "Oh..."
美里的表情随着真嗣的话而变得沮丧。"哦..."

"Cheer up, Misato," said Asuka. "One day I'll make something similar for him, so he'll know what he's missing out on."
振作点，美里，"明日香说道，"总有一天我也会为他做些类似的，让他知道他错过了什么。

"As much as I don't mind you discussing celebratory dinner plans," Fuyutsuki cut in, "we still have a debriefing to finish."
虽然我不介意你们讨论庆祝晚宴的计划，"冬月插话道，"但我们还有简报会要完成。

XXX

Once again, Misato was kept back as Shinji and Asuka left the briefing room. Kaji was waiting for them outside, and Asuka immediately launched into an enthusiastic retelling of their week of training. Shinji tuned her out as he leaned against the wall, again wondering what the Sub-Commander had to say to Misato.
又一次，当真嗣和明日香离开简报室时，美里被留了下来。加持在外面等着他们，明日香立刻兴致勃勃地开始讲述他们一周的训练经历。真嗣靠在墙上，对她的讲述充耳不闻，再次好奇副指挥官要对美里说些什么。

When she joined them in the hallway a few minutes later, Shinji saw a smile on her face that quickly evaporated upon seeing Kaji, and a smug grin grew on his face when she stomped past. Nonplussed, Shinji followed after Misato, but Asuka hung back with Kaji, still talking about the battle.
几分钟后，当她加入走廊里的他们时，真嗣看到她脸上原本挂着的笑容在见到加持时迅速消失，而当她踩着重步经过时，加持脸上露出了得意的笑容。真嗣不为所动，跟在美里后面，但明日香留在了加持身边，继续谈论着战斗。

"Misato?" he began when they reached the elevator. "Is... everything okay between you and Kaji?"
美里？" 当他们到达电梯时，他开口问道，"你和加持先生...一切都还好吗？

Misato humphed as she stabbed the call button. "Is everything okay between me and the jerk who disappears for ages then suddenly shows up with the plan that pulls my ass out of the fire?" she mockingly asked. "I guess. I just didn't want to give him the satisfaction."
美里哼了一声，用力按下呼叫按钮。"我和那个消失很久又突然带着救我于水火的计划出现的混蛋之间一切都好吗？" 她嘲讽地反问，"我想是的。我只是不想让他得意罢了。"

"Too late, I'm afraid!" 恐怕已经晚了！

Shinji watched as Misato slumped forward, resting her head against the wall with a groan. Turning around, he saw that Kaji and Asuka had caught up to them. And Kaji was somehow looking even more smug.
真嗣看着美里颓然前倾，头靠在墙上呻吟。他转过身，发现加持和明日香已经追了上来。而加持不知怎的，看起来更加得意了。

The trip up to the surface was made mostly in silence, punctuated by Kaji's attempts to start a conversation with Misato, who would give wordless grunts in reply. At one point Shinji raised an eyebrow at Asuka, who could only shrug her shoulders at how the two adults were acting around each other. Shinji decided then and there that adulthood was apparently not all it was cracked up to be.
前往地面的旅途大多在沉默中度过，其间夹杂着加持试图与美里搭话的努力，而美里只是以无言的咕哝作为回应。有一次，真嗣对明日香扬了扬眉毛，明日香也只能对着两位成年人之间的互动耸耸肩。真嗣当时就认定，成年人的世界显然并不像传闻中那么美好。

Only when Kaji departed at the surface did Misato's mood improve. The moment the scruffy man was out of sight she turned a sunny smile on her two wards.
直到加持在地面上离开后，美里的心情才有所好转。那个邋遢男人一消失在视线之外，她立刻对她的两个监护对象露出了灿烂的笑容。

"Right! It's a bit early for dinner, but do you want to go get it now anyway?" she asked.
"好！虽然还没到晚饭时间，但你们想现在就去吃吗？" 她问道。

Asuka nodded. "Sure. We didn't eat before getting in our Evas anyway, what with how LCL reacts with a full stomach."
明日香点了点头。"当然。我们之前没吃东西就进了 EVA，毕竟 LCL 与饱腹感反应不佳。"

Shinji shuddered. He had only needed to do that once before deciding never to eat just before having to pilot. He was glad that, at least so far, every Evangelion deployment had either been between meals, or at predetermined times that they could work around to prevent food... returning at unwanted times.
真嗣打了个寒颤。他只需一次便决定，绝不在驾驶前吃东西。庆幸的是，至少到目前为止，每次 EVA 出动要么是在两餐之间，要么是预定时间，可以调整以避免食物在不适宜的时刻“回访”。

He was most certainly not interested in learning what food prepared by Asuka tasted like on the... return trip.
他绝对不想知道，由明日香准备的食物在“回程”时会是什么味道。

XXX

For once, Misato's driving habits were a good thing. The pizza place was far enough away that if a normal person were driving, their food would have been cold by the time they got home. The NERV licence plates on Misato's car apparently meant she could ignore practically every road rule in the book, judging by the way she drove straight through red lights. Miraculously, the streets were still relatively quiet and no accidents happened.
难得一次，美里开车的习惯成了好事。披萨店离得够远，若普通人开车，到家时食物肯定凉了。美里车上的 NERV 车牌似乎意味着她可以无视几乎所有交通规则，看她闯红灯的样子就知道。奇迹般地，街道依旧相对宁静，没有发生任何事故。

That Shinji knew of at least.
至少据真嗣所知是这样。

At the apartment building, Misato unlocked her door and went in, followed by Asuka. Shinji, carrying the two pizza boxes, brought up the rear. As he turned the corner of the small hallway to the kitchen he almost dropped the boxes as he bumped into Asuka, who had been forced to stop by a stationary Misato.
在公寓楼里，美里打开了自己的房门走了进去，明日香紧随其后。真嗣手里提着两盒披萨，走在最后。当他拐过狭长走廊的拐角走向厨房时，差点因为撞上突然停下的明日香而把披萨盒掉落，原来是静止不动的美里挡住了去路。

"What's the holdup?" he asked, eager to set the pizzas down.
“怎么了？”他问道，急切地想放下披萨。

Asuka glanced back at him. "Wondergirl's back," she said in a low voice.
明日香回头看了他一眼，低声说：“那个奇迹女孩回来了。”

"Rei?" Shinji's face lit up. "Is she okay?!"
“绫波？”真嗣的脸上露出喜色，“她还好吗？！”

"She-" 她-

Before Asuka could finish her sentence, Misato suddenly stomped over to the fridge, where she grabbed several cans of beer before marching into the lounge. The slam of a sliding door signified that she had evidently retreated to her room.
还没等明日香说完，美里突然大步走向冰箱，抓了几罐啤酒就径直走进客厅。滑动门砰的一声关上，显然她已退回自己房间。

Now that Misato wasn't blocking his view, Shinji could see that Rei was standing by the sink, cloaked in a blanket. To his eyes, Rei looked as if she hadn't eaten in a long time, going by her sunken cheeks and a pale, skinny arm holding a glass of water.
美里这一走，真嗣才看清绫波站在水槽旁，裹着一条毯子。在他看来，绫波似乎很久没进食了，从她凹陷的双颊和苍白瘦弱的手臂握着一杯水就能看出。

One thing that hadn't changed was her demeanour. Rei looked at them with the same neutral expression as always, completely unfazed by Misato's sudden exit.
唯一不变的是她的态度。绫波一如既往地用那副中性的表情看着他们，对美里的突然离去毫不在意。

"Good afternoon," she murmured after a few seconds of silence.
"下午好，" 她沉默了几秒后轻声说道。

"Er, hi Rei," Shinji awkwardly replied as he set the pizza boxes down on the table. "How... um... how are you doing?"
呃，嗨，绫波，" 真嗣尴尬地回应着，同时将披萨盒放在桌上。"你... 呃... 你怎么样了？

Rei glanced at the boxes for a moment, perhaps attempting to discern their contents, before saying, "Better. I am cleared for light duties now, but it will take a little longer before I am fully recovered."
绫波瞥了一眼盒子，或许在试图辨认里面的东西，然后说："好些了。现在可以做些轻松的工作，但要完全恢复还需要一点时间。"

"What the hell actually happened?" asked Asuka. "Must have been something nasty to knock you out for a week."
到底发生了什么鬼事？" 明日香问道。"肯定是什么严重的事，让你昏迷了一周。

Rei froze, her eyes darting to the entrance to the lounge room. "I am not allowed to speak of the incident," she stiffly answered.
绫波愣住了，目光迅速扫向客厅的入口。"我不能谈论那件事，"她僵硬地回答。

Asuka slapped a hand to her face in frustration. "Of course you're not," she grumbled.
明日香恼火地用手拍了拍自己的脸。"当然不能，"她嘟囔道。

"Can you at least tell us if it's something that could happen again?" Shinji pressed.
"那你至少能告诉我们，这种事会不会再次发生？" 真嗣追问道。

"The chances of it happening again should be low. This was simply the consequence of an error in judgement."
再次发生的可能性应该很低。这仅仅是判断失误的后果。

"Judgement?" Shinji frowned in puzzlement, but Rei did not seem willing to speak further so he had no choice but to let the matter slide. "Well, anyway... we've got pizza for dinner tonight and-" A realisation occurred. "Oh wait, you're a vegetarian..."
审判？" 真嗣皱着眉头，一脸困惑，但绫波似乎不愿多说，他也只好作罢。"好吧，不管怎样...今晚我们吃披萨，还有——" 他突然意识到。"哦，等等，你是素食主义者...

"Yeah, a vegetarian, not a vegan," Asuka remarked as she pushed one of the pizza boxes to one side and opened the second. "Suppose we should confirm anyway though: how do you feel about dairy products, Rei? Would you be fine with this one?"
对，是素食主义者，不是纯素者，" 明日香一边说着，一边将一盒披萨推到一旁，打开了第二盒。"不过我们还是确认一下：你对乳制品感觉如何，绫波？这款你能接受吗？

Rei looked down at the 'margherita' pizza, as Asuka had named it. It was much less complicated than the Diavolo one that Asuka had been practically hopping in her car seat to enjoy, being simply tomato sauce, some kind of herb, and shredded mozzarella cheese. The Diavolo, on the other hand, had hot salami and other spicy things on it. Even without the meat, Shinji didn't believe Rei would enjoy that one.
绫波低头看着明日香称之为"玛格丽塔"的披萨。它比明日香几乎在车座上跳起来想要享用的"魔鬼"披萨简单得多，只有番茄酱、某种香草和切碎的马苏里拉奶酪。而"魔鬼"披萨上则有辣香肠和其他辛辣配料。即使没有肉类，真嗣也不认为绫波会喜欢那一款。

"There is no meat, so I can eat it," Rei finally said, to Shinji's quiet relief.
"没有肉，我可以吃，" 绫波最终说道，真嗣暗自松了口气。

Asuka grinned as she retrieved plates from the cupboard. "Alright, let's dig in!"
明日香从橱柜里取出盘子，咧嘴一笑：“好了，开动吧！”

XXX

After dinner, Shinji remembered while cleaning up the dishes that Misato had disappeared without having any of the pizza. When he placed a few of the remaining slices on a plate to take them to her, Rei surprised him by offering to deliver them to her. There was no real reason to say no, so he let her do it. He and Asuka then bid Rei goodbye and left for their apartment.
晚餐后，真嗣在洗碗时想起，美里竟然没吃披萨就消失了。他正准备将剩下的几片披萨放在盘子里给她送去，零却出乎意料地提出要帮他把披萨送过去。没有理由拒绝，于是他便让她去了。他和明日香随后向零道别，返回了自己的公寓。

As soon as they were gone, Rei slowly made the trek from the kitchen to Misato's bedroom door. She stood there for a short time, fidgeting with the plate in her hands, before finally knocking on the door.
他们一走，零便缓缓从厨房走向美里的卧室门口。她站在那里，手里端着盘子，有些局促不安，片刻后才终于敲响了门。

"G'way, Rei," came the slurred response from Misato.
“走开，零。”美里含糊不清的声音从门内传来。

Rei decided not to ask how Misato knew immediately that she was the one knocking. "I have brought you some of the pizza, since you left without eating."
绫波决定不去追问美里是如何立刻知道敲门的是她。“我给你带了些披萨，因为你走时没吃。”

"Jus' leave it by the door 'n go," Misato replied. "'fore I end up hurtin' you 'gain."
“就放门口然后走吧，”美里回答，“免得我又伤到你。”

Making what was possibly the fastest decision of her life outside of an Evangelion, Rei pushed the door open and stepped into the bedroom. The first thing she noticed was what looked like a pile of beer cans in the vague shape of a tower, reaching halfway to the ceiling.
在驾驶 EVA 之外，这可能是绫波一生中做出的最快决定，她推开门，踏进了卧室。首先映入眼帘的是一堆啤酒罐，隐约堆成塔状，几乎触及天花板。

The second thing she noticed was Misato, slumped against the wall perpendicular to the tower and dangling another can from her finger tips. She didn't look up at Rei's entrance, instead choosing to continue staring at nothing.
其次引起她注意的是美里，她瘫靠在与啤酒罐塔垂直的墙上，手指间还挂着一罐啤酒。她没有抬头看绫波进来，而是继续盯着虚空。

"Damnit Rei, do I have to go Captain on you?" she growled.
"该死，零，我非得用队长的身份来压你吗？" 她咆哮道。

"You are drunk," Rei stolidly replied. "I would likely not follow any order you gave me in such a condition."
你醉了，" 零冷静地回答，"在这种情况下，我可能不会服从你下达的任何命令。

Misato gave a single, sharp laugh. "Where was that smartness when I made you stop taking the medication that keeps you alive?"
美里发出一声尖锐的笑，"当初我让你停用维持你生命的药物时，你怎么没这么机灵？"

"...I do not have an answer for that." Even as Rei had made that fateful decision, she had believed that something would go wrong. Was it faith in her commanding officer that let Rei make the choice? Faith that was evidently misplaced, considering that she had then spent a week in Terminal Dogma where Doctor Akagi had had to work hard to keep Rei's body from destroying itself.
"...对此我无言以对。" 即便在做出那个决定时，零就预感会有什么差错。是出于对指挥官的信任才让零做出选择吗？显然这种信任是错付了，因为之后她就在中央教条区度过了一周，期间赤木博士不得不努力阻止零的身体自我崩溃。

Something that the scientist had been rather angry about, especially since this was the second time Rei had nearly died from not taking her medication. Doctor Akagi had even briefly considered, out loud, letting this body die so she could activate a new one. Only the fact that it had been a while since Rei's last memory backup had kept her from that fate.
科学家对此事颇为恼火，尤其因为这是第二次绫波丽因未服药而险些丧命。赤木博士甚至曾公开考虑过，让这具身体死去，以便激活新的身体。只是考虑到绫波丽上一次记忆备份已有一段时间，才阻止了这一决定。

"You prob'ly shouldn't even be living here anymore," Misato darkly remarked. "Why stay with someone that nearly friggin' killed you? Wouldn't be that hard t' get you another apartment here."
“你大概不该再住这儿了，”美里阴沉地说道，“干嘛还跟差点害死你的人住一起？在这儿给你另找个公寓也不难。”

"You did convince me," Rei retorted. "But ultimately I was the one who chose to acquiesce to your request."
“你确实说服了我，”绫波丽反驳道，“但最终是我自己选择顺从你的请求。”

"What, you gonna say we're both at fault here?"
“怎么，你想说我们俩都有错？”

"It is the truth. I knew what could happen if I didn't take my medication. But at the same time I wanted to believe that you were right." Rei stepped closer, putting the plate down next to Misato before moving back to the doorway. "I do not have any anger towards you for what happened, only disappointment in myself for ignoring my own mind warning me against abandoning my regimen."
这是事实。我知道如果不服药会发生什么。但同时我也想相信你是对的。" 绫波走近了一些，将盘子放在美里旁边后，又退回到门口。"我对你没有任何怨恨，只是对自己忽视内心警告，放弃治疗感到失望。

Misato looked up slightly, staring at Rei through the hair over her eyes. "...Was it... painful... what you had to go through for the last week?"
美里微微抬头，透过额前的头发凝视着绫波。"...过去这一周，你所经历的...痛苦吗？"

"I was either unconscious for most of it, or not in a state to feel much of anything," Rei replied, remembering the drugs Doctor Akagi had given her that had left her feeling like she was floating outside of her own body.
"大部分时间我都是昏迷的，或者处于无法感受太多事物的状态，" 绫波回答道，回想起赤木医生给她注射的药物，那种让她感觉自己仿佛漂浮在身体之外的感觉。

Both of them. 他们俩都是。

"Well... that's something at least," Misato murmured. She lifted the can in her hand to her mouth, drinking from it for several seconds. When it was empty, she rattled it slightly before throwing it at the tower of cans. The newly empty can missed, bouncing off the wall and onto the floor where it rolled towards Rei's feet.
"嗯...至少还有点什么," 葛城美里低声自语。她举起手中的罐子，对着嘴喝了好几秒。喝完后，她轻轻摇了摇空罐，然后朝那堆罐子扔去。新空的罐子没扔中，撞到墙上弹落到地板，滚向绫波丽的脚边。

Rei looked down at it for a few seconds, before returning her gaze to Misato. "You should stop wallowing in alcohol and guilt. There is nothing you can do to change the past, so there is no point in dwelling upon it. There are more important and valuable things to do with your free time."
绫波丽低头看了几秒，随后目光重新投向葛城美里。"你应该停止沉溺于酒精和内疚之中。你无法改变过去，所以纠结于此毫无意义。你的空闲时间应该用来做更重要、更有价值的事情。"

Misato chuckled. "Sorry Rei, but it'll take more than a nice speech from you to break half a lifetime of habit. Sad part is that this isn't even the worst thing I've done that I've tried to drink to forget."
葛城美里轻笑一声。"抱歉，绫波，但要想打破我这半辈子的习惯，光凭你一番好话是不够的。可悲的是，这甚至不是我试图借酒忘却的最糟糕的事情。"

"If you have been trying all this time without success, perhaps it is time to try something else?" Rei suggested.
"如果你一直尝试都未能成功，或许该是时候尝试别的方法了？" 绫波丽提议道。

"Nah, I'll stick with what I know best."
算了，我还是坚持我最擅长的吧。

"...Very well. I shall not bother you further on this subject tonight."
...好吧。今晚我不会再就这个话题打扰你了。

Getting only a grunt from Misato in response, Rei left the bedroom. After a moment's thought, she went into the kitchen to get a glass of water for Misato. After a second moment's thought, she instead took a bottle of water from the fridge and left it just inside Misato's bedroom before sliding the door shut. While she had never had alcohol, Rei still understood the effects of dehydrating substances. Her medication, that she was now determined to take every day until the end, required drinking more than the usual amount of water throughout the day.
只得到美里一声咕哝作为回应，绫波离开了卧室。稍作思考后，她走进厨房为美里倒了一杯水。又想了想，她改从冰箱里拿出一瓶水，放在美里卧室里，然后轻轻拉上门。尽管绫波从未喝过酒，但她仍明白脱水物质的影响。她决心每天坚持服用直到最后的药物，需要比平时喝更多的水。

And speaking of which... 说到这个...

Rei headed to her bedroom, where she gathered up the discarded pill bottles and returned them to where they belonged on her bedside table. As she was about to get into bed, she heard the faint sound of music from next door. Looking in that direction, she could see the doubled aura of Asuka through the wall, her arms and legs moving rapidly. It took a moment for Rei to realise that the Second Child was dancing. And though she couldn't see him, she was sure that Shinji was right next to her, mimicking the dance moves perfectly.
绫波丽走向卧室，将散落一地的药瓶收拾起来，放回床头柜上它们原本的位置。正要上床时，她听到隔壁传来微弱的音乐声。朝那个方向望去，透过墙壁，她能看到明日香的双重光环，她的四肢快速舞动。绫波丽过了一会儿才意识到第二适格者正在跳舞。虽然看不见他，但她确信真嗣就在她旁边，完美地模仿着舞步。

As Rei got under her bed covers, she contemplated how perfectly in tune the two were, and how the enforced state of synchronicity that would come in Instrumentality was but a pale shadow of what she had seen performed this day.
绫波丽钻进被窝，思索着两人是多么和谐一致，而即将到来的统一状态下的强制同步，与她今天所目睹的表演相比，不过是苍白的影子。

For the first time in her existence, Rei Ayanami questioned her purpose.
绫波丽有生以来第一次质疑自己的存在意义。

### Chapter 18 This Just Isn't The Same
此情已非彼时

"Are you saying that you now have two Children piloting a single Evangelion, Ikari?"
你是说现在有两个孩子共同驾驶一台 EVA，碇？

Gendo nodded at the hologram of SEELE 02. "Correct. With the Third Child unable to project an AT-Field, it would be too risky to deploy Unit-01."
源渡对着 SEELE 02 的 hologram 点了点头。"没错。由于第三适格者无法展开 AT 力场，单独部署初号机风险太大。"

"Just have him pilot one of the others," SEELE 05 gruffly said. "The Second Child has already shown that she can pilot Unit-01 herself."
那就让他去驾驶别的机体，" SEELE 05 粗声粗气地说。"第二适格者已经证明了她自己就能驾驶初号机。

"But the test results and their recent battles show that the Second and Third fight better together than apart," SEELE 07 noted. "Besides, with the Third's inability to use an AT-Field, any Evangelion is at risk if he were to pilot it on his own."
但测试结果和他们最近的战斗表明，第二和第三适格者合作比单独作战更有效，" SEELE 07 指出。"此外，考虑到第三适格者无法使用 AT 力场，如果他单独驾驶任何一台 EVA，都会面临风险。

"Then let's get rid of him and find the Fourth!" SEELE 05 angrily retorted. "That's what should have been done in the first place, rather than wasting time and money on trying to fix a broken tool!"
那就把他除掉，去找第四适格者！" SEELE 05 愤怒地反驳道，"本来就该这么做，而不是浪费时间和金钱去修理一个破损的工具！

"As it is, preparations are already underway to locate the Fourth Child," Gendo cut in, his eyes darting to SEELE 05's hologram for a split second. "But these things take time. Rest assured that all three Evangelions will be fully operational before the time comes that we require a full complement."
目前，寻找第四适格者的准备工作已经在进行中，" 源渡插话道，他的目光短暂地扫向 SEELE 05 的全息影像，"但这些事情需要时间。请放心，在我们需要全员上阵之前，三台 EVA 都将完全投入运作。

SEELE 05 harrumphed. "Maybe you're just keeping the Third around because he's your son, Ikari."
SEELE 05 哼了一声，"或许你只是因为第三适格者是你儿子才留着他，碇。"

"My familial relationship with the Third Child is of no concern here," Gendo stiffly replied. "If he were useless, I would have immediately discarded him. There is no place for dead weight in NERV. He has proven useful, so he shall continue to be put to use."
我与第三适格者的家庭关系与此无关，" 源渡生硬地回应，"如果他无用，我会立刻舍弃他。NERV 没有无用之人的位置。他已经证明了自己的价值，因此将继续被利用。

"That is satisfactory," SEELE 01 finally spoke up. "This is nothing but a minor bump in the road, and we will adapt to the situation. The Fourth Child shall simply be located ahead of our original schedule. Is there anything else to report, Ikari?"
这可以接受，" SEELE 01 最终开口道。"这不过是路途中的一个小坎坷，我们会适应情况。第四适格者只需比原计划提前找到即可。还有其他要报告的吗，碇？

Gendo shook his head. "No. The Angels appear as the Scrolls predict, and they will be removed from our path like the trifling obstacles they are. Nothing shall stand between us and our goal."
碇摇了摇头。"没有。使徒的出现正如卷轴所预言，它们将像微不足道的障碍一样被清除出我们的道路。没有任何事物能阻挡我们达成目标。"

"Very well. You are dismissed, Ikari."
很好。你可以退下了，碇。

The holograms faded away, leaving Gendo in the middle of a dark room, illuminated only by the single weak light above the desk he sat behind. A minute passed before somebody stepped into the circle of light.
全息影像消散后，碇独自留在昏暗的房间中，只有他坐着的桌子上方一盏微弱的灯光照亮四周。过了一分钟，有人踏入了这片光圈。

"I'm surprised they didn't dig into why the Third Child can't use an AT-Field," Fuyutsuki remarked, his hands folded behind his back as he stared into the darkness.
"我挺惊讶他们没深究为什么第三适格者无法使用 AT 力场，"冬月说道，双手背在身后，凝视着黑暗。

"Perhaps they assume incompetence. Besides, there is no explanation we could give the Old Men, as we don't yet know ourselves," Gendo replied.
"或许他们认为这是无能。况且，我们也没法向那些老家伙解释，毕竟我们自己也不清楚，"碇源堂回答。

"But we do know, don't we? Your son blurted it out in front of the entire bridge crew."
但我们其实是知道的，不是吗？你儿子在全体桥员面前说漏了嘴。

Gendo remained silent. When Fuyutsuki realised that no answer was forthcoming, he turned and exited the room, leaving the Commander alone with his thoughts.
碇源堂沉默不语。当冬月意识到不会有回应时，他转身离开了房间，留下指挥官独自沉思。

XXX

Shinji looked around for a way out, but found nothing. All escape routes were blocked, and he was right in the path of incredible danger. He gulped, bracing himself to take the blast full on.
真嗣四处寻找出路，却一无所获。所有逃生路线都被封锁，而他正处在极度危险的轨迹上。他咽了口唾沫，准备硬抗即将到来的冲击。

"I... I said that... your... um... b-beauty sleep is i-important?" he finally quavered.
"我...我刚说...你...呃...那个...美...美容觉很...很重要？" 他终于颤抖着说出口。

"So you're saying that I need beauty sleep?!" Asuka retorted, arms crossed as she glared a hole through him, the wall of the lounge room behind him, and the next building over.
"所以你是说我需要美容觉了？!" 明日香反驳道，双臂交叉，目光如炬，仿佛要将他、他身后的客厅墙壁以及隔壁建筑一并洞穿。

"N-no!" Shinji stammered, his body trying to both run away and freeze in place. "T-that's not w-what I meant!"
不...不是的！" 真嗣结巴着，身体既想逃跑又僵在原地。"我...我不是那个意思！

Asuka was now staring at him with an intensity to rival the Fifth Angel. "Then just what the hell did you mean, Third Child?!"
明日香此刻正以堪比第五使徒的强烈目光盯着他。“那你到底是什么意思，第三适格者？！”

Shinji turned a desperate glance upon Misato, standing in the doorway between him and freedom, who simply raised her hands to show that she was staying out of this. The huge grin on her face didn't help matters.
真嗣绝望地看向站在他和自由之间的门口的葛城，她只是举起双手表示自己不会插手此事。她脸上那巨大的笑容更是让情况雪上加霜。

"If you're going to call someone ugly," Asuka continued in a very icy tone, "then at least have the balls to come out and say it directly!"
“如果你要说某人丑，”明日香继续用冰冷的语气说道，“那至少要有胆量直接说出来！”

By this time tomorrow, Shinji was going to be sixty feet under. Because Asuka would have hijacked her own Evangelion just to stomp him into the ground. As sweat started to bead on his forehead, Shinji decided there was nothing left to lose; he may as well just go all out.
到了明天这个时候，真嗣恐怕就要被埋在六十英尺之下了。因为明日香会劫持自己的 EVA，只为将他踩进土里。随着额头上的汗珠开始凝结，真嗣觉得已经没有什么可失去的了；他或许应该豁出去，全力以赴。

"I-it's just a m-metaphor, Asuka! Y-you're so far from ugly that you... err... couldn't... spot it with a telescope...?"
那只是个比喻，明日香！你离丑陋远得...呃...用望远镜都找不着你...？

It was the best he could come up with on such short notice, but to his great relief, Asuka relaxed her stare a fraction.
这是他仓促间能想到最好的说法，令他大为宽慰的是，明日香的眼神稍微缓和了一些。

"So I'm not ugly after all?" Asuka wondered out loud, tilting her head to the side as she tapped a finger on her arm. Shinji nodded desperately, and her hands moved down to her hips as she took a couple of steps forward. "In that case, what am I?"
那我其实并不丑咯？" 明日香自言自语道，歪着头，手指轻敲着手臂。真嗣拼命地点头，她双手叉腰，向前走了几步。"那我到底是什么？

That relief quickly vanished.
然而，这份宽慰很快便烟消云散了。

"...What?" he ever-so-eloquently responded.
"...什么？" 他颇为机智地回应道。

"You have slighted me, Ikari," Asuka replied, pointing an imperious finger at him. "Doesn't matter if you meant it or not, you still did it. Girls don't like it when they are insulted, you know." She leaned forward. He leaned back. "What are you going to do to earn my forgiveness?"
你冒犯了我，碇君，" 明日香回答，傲慢地指着他。"不管你是有意还是无意，你都已经做了。你知道的，女孩子不喜欢被侮辱。" 她向前倾身，他则向后退。"你打算怎么做来赢得我的原谅？

Misato piped up, her voice sounding hideously saccharine to Shinji's ears. "Would a compliment do the trick? Balance out the insult, kind of thing?"
美里插话进来，她的声音在真嗣听来异常甜腻。"一句赞美能解决问题吗？抵消那句侮辱，类似这样的？"

Shinji almost fell over in shock. Asuka glanced at Misato, eyebrows raised as she pondered the idea. After a moment, she gave their guardian a big smile. "Why, I think that would work just fine, Misato!" That smile vanished instantly as she turned her full attention back to him.
真嗣几乎惊得要摔倒。明日香瞥了美里一眼，挑起眉毛思考着这个提议。片刻后，她对他们的监护人露出了灿烂的笑容。"嗯，我想这完全可行，美里！" 然而，当她再次将全部注意力转向他时，那笑容瞬间消失了。

All Shinji wanted to do was flee as fear warred with confusion and mortification in the confines of his head. An Angel attack would have been met with a cry of joy at this point, and he would have gladly tried to kill it without Unit-01 if it meant an escape from this nightmare.
新世纪只想逃离，恐惧与困惑、羞愧在他脑海中交战。此时若遭遇使徒袭击，他甚至会欢呼雀跃，哪怕不用初号机，他也愿意尝试去消灭它，只为逃离这场噩梦。

"So tell me, Shinji," Asuka whispered almost menacingly, leaning even closer. "If I'm so far from ugly that you'd need a telescope, what precisely does that make me?"
那么告诉我，真嗣，"明日香几乎带着威胁地低语，身体更加贴近。"如果我离丑陋远到需要望远镜才能看到，那我究竟算什么？

Shinji heard Misato stifle an amused snort and he groaned internally. Who would have thought that a simple reply to someone else's offhanded remark would cause such chaos?
真嗣听到美里忍俊不禁的轻笑，内心哀叹。谁能想到，对别人随口一句话的简单回应，竟会引发如此混乱？

"W-well... A-Asuka..." he began, before nervously clearing his throat. "Since I just accidentally insulted you without even realising, I... I don't think I could say the right thing... and why would anything I say matter?"
呃...那个...明日香..."他开口道，随即紧张地清了清嗓子。"既然我无意中冒犯了你，我自己都没意识到，我...我觉得我说不出什么恰当的话...而且，我说的又有什么意义呢？

Finally, mercifully, Asuka relaxed her posture somewhat. Now she was just giving him a look of disappointment. "Look, Shinji... we're friends, aren't we?"
终于，仁慈地，明日香稍微放松了她的姿势。现在她只是用一种失望的眼神看着他。“听着，真嗣...我们是朋友，对吧？”

An easy question. Shinji thanked the gods. Finally, something he could actually answer properly. "Of course we are! What kind of question is that?"
一个简单的问题。真嗣感谢了神明。终于，有他能够真正正确回答的事情了。“当然我们是！这是什么问题啊？”

"Good." Asuka folded her arms again, looking away as she muttered, "I'd hate to think that my first real friend didn't think of me as one."
“那就好。”明日香再次交叉双臂，转过头去喃喃自语，“我可不想认为我的第一个真正的朋友不把我当作朋友。”

"First... real friend?" Shinji slowly echoed.
“第一个...真正的朋友？”真嗣缓缓地重复道。

Anger returned to Asuka's eyes. "Damn right you're the first real friend I have!" she exploded. "Hell, until I came to Japan you were the only goddamn friend I had!"
怒火再次在明日香的眼中燃起。“你说的没错，你是我第一个真正的朋友！”她爆发道，“该死，直到我来日本之前，你是我唯一的朋友！”

Shinji blinked in shock. How could someone as smart and popular as Asuka possibly not have made friends hand over fist?
真嗣震惊地眨了眨眼。像明日香这样聪明又受欢迎的人，怎么可能没有交到一大堆朋友呢？

As if she could hear his thoughts, Asuka went on, her voice turning bitter. "Turns out, skipping straight to college at ten years old doesn't sit well with some people!"
仿佛能听到他的心声，明日香继续说道，声音变得苦涩。“结果发现，十岁就直接跳级上大学，有些人就是看不惯！”

Sensing a minefield, Shinji tried to steer away from it. "T-then those people are idiots," he said in what he hoped was a placating tone. "It doesn't matter now anyway. You have friends here... besides me I mean." He glanced pointedly at Misato, who immediately nodded.
察觉到这是一个雷区，真嗣试图绕开。“那、那些人就是傻瓜，”他用一种希望是安抚的语气说道，“反正现在也不重要了。你在这里有朋友……除了我之外。”他特意看了看美里，后者立刻点了点头。

"Eh." Asuka shrugged. "Just meant I could focus more on kicking their academic asses. Anyway! Where were we? Oh. Yes."
嗯。" 明日香耸了耸肩，"只是意味着我可以更专注于踢他们的学术屁股。不管怎样！我们说到哪儿了？哦，对了。

Out of the minefield, back into the other minefield.
刚出雷区，又入另一雷区。

"So what is it, Ikari?" she demanded. "Are we not really friends like you said? Or are you just too much of a 'nice guy' to call me ugly directly?"
那到底是什么意思，碇？" 她质问道，"我们不是真的朋友，就像你说的那样吗？还是你太'好人'了，不敢直接说我丑？

Put on the spot, with all attention squarely on him and his very life on the line, Shinji's hand began to spasmodically clench and unclench; something that hadn't happened for a long time. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths.
被逼到墙角，所有目光都集中在他身上，生命悬于一线，真嗣的手开始不由自主地紧握又松开；这种情况已经很久没有发生了。他闭上眼睛，深吸了几口气。

Well then... what better way for an Evangelion pilot to go out than in a blaze of glory? It would certainly be more fitting than just giving up. Shinji opened his eyes and squared his shoulders.
那么... 作为 EVA 驾驶员，还有什么比在辉煌中落幕更好的结局呢？这肯定比放弃要来得更合适。真嗣睁开眼睛，挺直了肩膀。

"Asuka... you're the first real friend I ever had as well," he began. "In fact, I'd even go so far as to call you my best friend."
明日香... 你也是我第一个真正的朋友，" 他开始说道。"事实上，我甚至愿意称你为我最好的朋友。

Something in his voice obviously struck a chord with Asuka. Her arms slowly dropped to her sides as she stared at him.
他声音中的某种东西显然触动了明日香的心弦。她缓缓放下双臂，凝视着他。

"And... and... you'retheprettiestgirlI'veeverseen!"
而且... 而且... 你是我见过的最漂亮的女孩！

The very instant those words left his lips, Shinji barged past Misato and ran out of her apartment. He didn't stop until he was safely in his room, where he flopped onto his bed and promptly began to hyperventilate into his pillow.
话音刚落，真嗣便推开美里，冲出了她的公寓。他一路狂奔，直到安全回到自己的房间，一头栽倒在床上，随即开始将脸埋在枕头里大口喘气。

XXX

Stunned by Shinji's outburst, Misato had no chance to corral him as he made his escape; she could only blink at his retreating back. As soon as the door to her apartment closed, she inhaled deeply, letting the breath out in a long impressed whistle.
被真嗣的突然爆发惊呆了，美里根本来不及拦住他逃跑；她只能眨着眼看着他的背影远去。公寓门一关上，她深吸一口气，长长地吹出一声赞叹的口哨。

"Well, I think a simple 'you're cute' would have been fine," she remarked. When there was no response from Asuka, she turned to see that the redhead was now red-faced and staring at nothing. "...Ah."
哎呀，我觉得简单一句'你很可爱'就挺好的嘛。" 她评论道。见明日香没有回应，她转头一看，发现红发少女已经满脸通红，目光空洞地盯着前方。"...啊。

Misato gently guided the shell-shocked girl over to a kitchen chair and sat down beside her.
美里温柔地引导着惊魂未定的少女走到厨房的椅子旁，自己也坐了下来，陪在她身边。

"Did... he..." Asuka haltingly said after a minute of silence.
"他...他真的..." 沉默了一分钟后，明日香断断续续地说道。

"He did," Misato affirmed. "And now he's probably hiding in his room. Now be honest, that bit of fun got a little out of hand, didn't it?"
他确实这么做了，" 美里确认道，"现在他可能正躲在房间里。老实说，刚才那场玩笑是不是有点过头了？

"...Yeah. I didn't expect him to say... that. I was just... you know... enjoying pretending to be insulted. I thought he would have either picked up on that or just... I dunno... caved in and begged for forgiveness."
...嗯。我没料到他会那么说。我只是...你知道的...享受那种假装被冒犯的感觉。我以为他要么会察觉到这一点，要么就...我不知道...屈服并请求原谅。

"So why are you so surprised?" Misato wondered. "Surely you've been complimented before."
那你为什么这么惊讶？" 美里好奇地问，"你肯定以前也被夸奖过吧。

Asuka nodded; her blush was finally starting to die down. "Yeah, boys at school have tried flirting with me, but... it's pretty damn obvious what they're really after." She shuddered, then sighed. "I don't know why what Shinji said hit me the way it did."
明日香点了点头，脸上的红晕终于开始消退。“嗯，学校里的男生们也试过跟我搭讪，但……他们真正想要什么，实在太明显了。”她打了个寒颤，然后叹了口气。“我不明白为什么真嗣的话会让我这么触动。”

"I think I do!" Asuka turned to look at her, and Misato grinned cheekily. "But it'll be more fun for me to let you find out yourself!"
“我想我知道原因！”明日香转头看向她，而美里则调皮地咧嘴一笑。“不过，让你自己发现会更有趣！”

Asuka got to her feet. "Misato?"
明日香站起身来。“美里？”

"Yeeeesss?" “嗯——？”

"I hate you." She stalked out of the lounge room.
"我讨厌你。" 她气冲冲地走出了客厅。

"No you don't!" Misato called after her. Her apartment door opened and closed again, and she proceeded to burst out laughing.
"你才不是真的讨厌呢！" 葛城在她身后喊道。她的公寓门开了又关，随后她忍不住大笑起来。

The kids were so much fun to tease.
逗这些孩子玩真是太有趣了。

XXX

As was to be expected, the next couple of days were... slightly uncomfortable for Shinji. He couldn't look Asuka in the eye at all, and apparently she couldn't manage it either. At least, she was always looking the other way whenever he worked up the courage to glance at her.
不出所料，接下来的几天对真嗣来说有些尴尬。他根本无法直视明日香，显然她也无法做到。至少，每当他鼓起勇气看向她时，她总是把目光移开。

But eventually things returned to normal. They started having proper conversations again, ones that didn't devolve into a mess of stuttering, and Shinji managed to stop blushing constantly in Asuka's presence.
但最终一切恢复了正常。他们又开始进行正常的对话，不再是一团乱麻般的结巴，而真嗣在明日香面前也终于不再满脸通红。

Then she invited him to join her on a shopping trip after school.
随后，她邀请他放学后一起去购物。

"But we got clothes already, Asuka," said Shinji. "We went shopping when Rei moved in."
但我们已经有衣服了，明日香，"真嗣说，"丽搬进来时我们不是刚买过吗？

"Oh dear," Misato remarked, theatrically putting a hand to her face before giving him a sad look. "You just don't understand women, Shinji."
哎呀，"美里夸张地用手捂住脸，然后向他投去一个哀怨的眼神，"你真是不懂女人心啊，真嗣。

"...Is there a book?" ...有书吗？

Asuka and Misato glanced at each other before chuckling.
明日香和美里相视一笑，随后轻笑出声。

"You wish," Asuka remarked, unable to keep a grin off her face. "You, and every other man on the planet."
你想得美，"明日香回应道，脸上忍不住挂着笑意。"你，还有这地球上的每一个男人。

XXX

The school day crawled towards its end, and Shinji was not very surprised when Horaki came along with Asuka when they passed the school gate. Toji and Kensuke gave him some envious looks before heading home. He tagged along behind the girls, feeling somewhat awkward as Asuka and Horaki chatted about things he knew nothing about.
学校的一天缓缓走向尾声，当东二和健介在经过校门时投来羡慕的目光，然后各自回家时，真嗣并不十分惊讶地看到东治也和明日香一起走了过来。他跟在两位女生后面，听着她们谈论着自己一无所知的话题，感到有些尴尬。

When they got to the mall, Asuka surprised Shinji by not immediately heading for the shops. Instead, their first stop was the food court where she made a beeline right for a stall that sold crepes. Only once the three of them were fuelled by the sugary treats did Asuka head for the true destination. When Shinji realised what store she was about to go into, he came to a sudden stop, turned red and turned around.
当他们到达商场时，明日香并没有立刻冲向商店，这让真嗣感到意外。相反，他们的第一站是美食广场，她径直走向一个卖可丽饼的摊位。只有当三人都被甜食补充了能量后，明日香才前往真正的目的地。当真嗣意识到她即将进入哪家店时，他突然停下脚步，脸红了起来，转身就走。

From behind, he heard Asuka laugh at his embarrassment. "Come on, Shinji. Don't you want to see all that sexy swimwear?"
从背后，他听到明日香对他的尴尬发出笑声。“来吧，真嗣。你不想看看那些性感的泳装吗？”

"W-wait!" Horaki sputtered. "You want h-him to go into there with us?!"
“等、等等！”洞木结巴地说，“你、你想让他和我们一起进去？！”

"I'm staying out here," Shinji resolutely said. "That is not a place for me to go."
“我留在外面，”真嗣坚决地说，“那不是我该去的地方。”

"They have men's swimwear too," Asuka said invitingly, right next to his ear. "Could get something for yourself."
他们也有男士泳装哦，" 明日香在他耳边诱惑地说道，"你可以给自己挑一件。

Shinji just shook his head.
真嗣只是摇了摇头。

"Pfeh. Wuss." 哼，胆小鬼。

The last thing he heard before the girls went into the shop was Horaki wondering why Asuka was trying to bring him in as well. Figuring that Asuka would probably be in there for a while, he sat down on a nearby bench, making sure to sit so that he was most definitely not looking at that store.
在女孩们进入店铺前，他最后听到的是洞木光疑惑为什么明日香也想拉他进去。考虑到明日香可能会在里面逛上一阵子，他便在附近的长椅上坐下，特意调整坐姿，确保自己绝不会朝那家店看去。

Shinji breathed a sigh of relief. Trap avoided. Being out here meant that Asuka wouldn't be able to call him a pervert or tease him until the accumulated embarrassment caused him to detonate powerfully enough to kill an Angel. Horaki probably would have been even more embarrassed than him at Asuka's antics, so at least she should be fine in there now.
真嗣松了一口气。陷阱躲过了。待在外面意味着明日香无法再叫他变态，或是捉弄他，直到累积的尴尬感足以让他爆发出杀死使徒的力量。大概豪猪也会因为明日香的恶作剧而比他更尴尬，所以至少现在她在里面应该没事。

Time passed. Shinji kept his eyes on the store opposite the one the girls were in. While this one was also a clothing store, its contents were a lot more sombre, consisting of what looked to him like the exact same business suit on every mannequin.
时间流逝。真嗣的目光一直盯着女孩们所在店铺对面的那家店。虽然那也是一家服装店，但里面的商品要沉闷得多，在他看来，每具模特身上都穿着一模一样的商务套装。

"Thinking of being a salaryman?"
想成为上班族吗？

He turned to loo- "Gyah!"
他转头望去——"啊！"

Shinji jumped in surprise at Asuka's sudden proximity to his face, falling off the bench and landing on the ground in an undignified heap. Asuka stared at him bemusedly for a moment before reaching out and dragging him to his feet. He rubbed his sore rear end as Asuka proceeded to rummage around in her shopping bag. Horaki was nearby, looking somewhat red in the face.
真嗣被明日香突然贴近的脸吓了一跳，从长椅上跌落，狼狈地摔在地上。明日香愣了一会儿，然后伸手把他拉起来。他揉着疼痛的臀部，而明日香则开始在购物袋里翻找。一旁的洞木则显得有些脸红。

"Since you refused to come in with us, I had to guess at what size you were," she said before letting out a short cry of triumph as she pulled a piece of clothing out of the bag and held it in front of Shinji.
"既然你拒绝跟我们进来，我只好猜你的尺码了，"她说着，随即发出一声短促的胜利欢呼，从袋中抽出一件衣物，在真嗣面前展示。

It was possibly the only pair of purple and neon-green shorts in the world, and Asuka had somehow managed to find them.
这可能是世界上唯一一条紫色配霓虹绿的短裤，而明日香不知怎么就找到了它。

"I took a wild guess and decided you wouldn't want something more... ah... revealing," she continued, grinning when Shinji's face began to pink up to match Horaki.
"我大胆猜测，你应该不会想要更...呃...暴露的款式，"她继续说道，当真嗣的脸开始泛起与洞木相配的粉红色时，她露出了得意的笑容。

"W-wait, you got these for me?" There was certainly nothing wrong with the shorts, but he wasn't expecting to be getting something out of this trip as well.
"等、等等，这些是给我的吗？"短裤本身并无不妥，但他没想到这次旅行还能收到礼物。

Asuka's whole body slumped as she sighed. "No, I got them for Pen-pen, genius," she sarcastically retorted.
明日香叹了口气，整个人都显得有些颓然。"不，我是给企鹅买的，天才。"她讽刺地反驳道。

"Oh. Um... why?" 哦。嗯...为什么？

Both Horaki and Asuka looked at each other, then at him. "Weren't you paying attention yesterday, Shinji?" Asuka asked exasperatedly. "Our class is going on a trip to Okinawa next week."
洞木和明日香互望一眼，然后看向他。"你昨天没听讲吗，真嗣？"明日香不耐烦地问，"我们班下周要去冲绳旅行。"

"Oh. Right." Shinji had faintly heard something to that effect, but hadn't been paying much attention at the time and thought it had something to do with the school's pool area. "Wait, they're not going to try and make us wear the school bathing gear?"
哦，对。" 真嗣隐约听到过类似的话，但当时没太在意，还以为和学校的泳池区有关。"等等，他们不会是想让我们穿学校的泳装吧？

Horaki shook her head. "School uniform policy isn't enforced on trips like this."
堀崎摇了摇头。"像这种旅行，学校制服规定不强制执行。"

Asuka snorted. "And good luck trying to get a bunch of teenagers to wear uniforms on what is essentially a holiday."
明日香嗤之以鼻。"想让一群青少年在本质上算是度假的时候穿制服，祝你好运。"

"I suppose that makes sense," Shinji mused. "So, is there anything else we need to do here?"
这么说也有道理，" 真嗣沉思道。"那么，我们在这里还有什么需要做的吗？

"Nah, we're done. Hikari's gotta get home soon anyway to start cooking dinner."
算了，我们结束了。光也差不多该回家准备晚饭了。

With that said, the teenagers left the mall and headed home. Horaki split off halfway, waving goodbye as she turned a corner, and Asuka and Shinji continued on.
说完，这群少年离开了商场，各自回家。堀木在中途分道扬镳，拐过街角时挥手告别，而明日香和真嗣继续同行。

"Damn, this is gonna be great!" Asuka enthused. "A whole week of relaxation, sunbathing, and swimming!"
太棒了，这周绝对爽翻天！" 明日香兴奋地说，"整整一周的放松、日光浴和游泳！

"Hang on," said Shinji as he remembered something. "Don't we need to get Misato to sign the permission slips first?
等等，" 真嗣突然想起什么，"我们是不是得先让美里签字同意书才行？

"We can do that tonight when we're together for dinner," Asuka replied, brushing the question off with a wave of her hand. "It's just a formality anyway. She's bound to let us go."
我们可以在今晚一起吃晚饭时谈这个，" 明日香回答道，挥了挥手将问题撇到一边。"反正只是个形式而已。她肯定会放我们走的。

XXX

"What do you mean we can't go?!"
你说我们不能去是什么意思？！

Misato raised an eyebrow at the irate girl in front of her. "I'm sorry, did I stutter or something? I said you can't go to Okinawa."
美里对面前愤怒的女孩挑了挑眉。"对不起，我是不是结巴了？我说了，你们不能去冲绳。"

"Why not?!" 为什么不行？！

Shinji struggled mightily to suppress any reaction as Asuka petulantly stomped her foot. Fortunately he was on the other side of her to Misato, so he was out of her sight.
真嗣极力抑制着自己的反应，因为明日香正任性地跺着脚。幸好他站在她与美里之间，所以没有被她看到。

Misato put a hand to her forehead in exasperation. "I would have thought that would be obvious, what with you being a genius and all," she grumbled. "You can't leave Tokyo-3 at all because you're an Eva pilot. As such you are to remain close to the Geofront at all times in case of an attack."
美里无奈地用手扶额，抱怨道：“我以为这很明显，毕竟你是天才嘛。你不能离开第三新东京市，因为你是 EVA 驾驶员。因此，你必须时刻留在 Geofront 附近，以防遭受攻击。”

Asuka let out a long and exaggerated groan as she dropped her head onto the table with enough force to rattle the plates they had just been eating from.
明日香发出一声长长的夸张叹息，猛地将头砸在桌上，震得刚用完餐的盘子都叮当作响。

"Sorry, but that's just the way it is," Misato added sympathetically.
“抱歉，但情况就是这样。”美里同情地补充道。

Shinji heard Asuka mutter something unintelligible, before she raised her head. "Thanks for letting me know after I wasted my cash on swimwear."
真嗣听到明日香嘟囔了一句听不清的话，随后她抬起头来。"谢谢你在我浪费钱买了泳装之后才告诉我。"

"If you want to go swimming, there is a pool in the Geofront," Rei suggested. "I go there quite often."
如果你想游泳，在 Geofront 里有一个泳池，"绫波提议道，"我经常去那里。

Asuka looked sidelong at her, before slouching. "It won't be the same, Wondergirl. There's a massive difference between a lovely beach and an indoor pool."
明日香斜眼看了看她，然后颓然坐下。"那不一样，奇迹女孩。美丽的海滩和室内泳池之间有着天壤之别。"

"I'd advise you to take what you can get," said Misato. "Besides, there's something else that would have made me consider whether or not to let you go."
我建议你知足吧，"美里说，"而且，还有其他事情会让我考虑是否让你去。

Sitting up straight in her chair, Asuka gave their guardian a look of puzzlement.
直挺挺地坐在椅子上，明日香向他们的监护人投去困惑的目光。

"I contacted your school and asked how you three were doing in classes," Misato clarified. "I'd like to say I'm impressed with all three, but let's be frank here." She looked between her wards. "Rei, while your test scores are among the highest in your grade, apparently you spend a surprising amount of time either absent or staring out a window. And Asuka and Shinji... I know you you can do better than what I've been told."
我联系了你们的学校，询问了你们三人在课堂上的表现，" 美里解释道，"我得说我为你们三个感到骄傲，但让我们坦诚一点。" 她目光在她的被监护人之间流转，"绫波，尽管你的考试成绩在年级中名列前茅，但显然你缺席或望着窗外的时间出奇地多。至于明日香和真嗣... 我知道你们能做得比我所听到的更好。

Before Asuka and Shinji could retort, she raised a hand to quiet them. "Now I understand that you did miss a week of school recently due to NERV commitments, and NERV does demand quite a bit of your time on occasion, but if you're having trouble keeping up then you should say something. I asked the school to prepare some make-up work that you can do next week while your class is gone."
在明日香和真嗣反驳之前，她举起手示意他们安静。"现在我明白你们最近因为 NERV 的任务确实缺了一周的课，而且 NERV 有时确实会占用你们很多时间，但如果你们跟不上进度，就应该说出来。我请学校为你们准备了一些补课作业，下周你们班外出时可以做。"

Shinji joined Asuka in groaning at that unwelcome news. "So, we're going to be spending all next week cramming to catch up?" he gloomily asked.
真嗣和明日香一同对这则不受欢迎的消息发出哀叹。"那么，我们下周要整周恶补来赶上进度吗？" 他沮丧地问道。

"I'd like to think I'm not a harsh mistress," Misato replied. "As long as all the work is done by the end of the week, you can spend as much time at the Geofront's pool as you like."
我倒希望自己不是个苛刻的上司，" 葛城回应道，"只要周末前把所有工作完成，你们想在 Geofront 的泳池待多久都行。

The pilots glanced at each other. Rei's face was inscrutable, but then she didn't have to worry about extra homework. Asuka's face, on the other hand, reminded Shinji of a grey cloud threatening to let loose with lightning.
驾驶员们相互对视。绫波的表情一如既往地难以捉摸，不过她倒是不用担心额外的作业。而明日香的脸色，相比之下，让真嗣想起了即将释放雷电的阴云。

He decided to try and be diplomatic. "Alright, we could always take the homework to the Geofront and do it poolside."
他决定尝试一下外交手腕。"好吧，我们可以把作业带到 Geofront，在泳池边做。"

"Good." Misato got up, collecting their plates and depositing them in the sink. "Alright, I'm gonna get out of your hair for now. Goodnight." She gave them a parting wave and left.
"很好。" 葛城起身，收拾起盘子放入水槽。"好了，我就不打扰你们了。晚安。" 她挥手告别，离开了。

"I shall do the same," said Rei, who also bid them goodnight before departing.
"我也一样。" 说完，绫波也向他们道了晚安，然后离开了。

Shinji began to wash the dishes. Apart from the sounds of water and crockery, the apartment was silent, and he soon began humming a nameless tune. Just as he thought that Asuka had sneaked out of the kitchen without him hearing her, the hairs on the back of his neck suddenly stood on end. He stiffened, then tried to resume scrubbing a particularly resilient stain on the final plate.
真嗣开始洗碗。除了水声和餐具的碰撞声，公寓里一片寂静，他很快便哼起了一首无名的曲调。正当他以为明日香悄无声息地溜出了厨房时，他颈后的毛发突然竖了起来。他僵硬了一下，然后试图继续擦洗最后那个顽固的盘子上的污渍。

"You seem rather... nonchalant about this."
你对此似乎相当...漫不经心啊。

As he feared, Asuka was standing right behind him; practically breathing down his neck. He gave the plate one final vain wipe, then turned to face her, wiping his hands on a towel.
正如他所担心的，明日香就站在他身后；几乎是在他脖子后面呼吸。他对着盘子做了一次徒劳的最后擦拭，然后转过身来面对她，用手巾擦了擦手。

"Pardon?" 什么？

Asuka waved a hand. "About not being able to go to Okinawa. You don't seem to care too much."
明日香挥了挥手，"关于不能去冲绳的事。你好像并不是很在意。"

Shinji rubbed the back of his head, looking away slightly. "Well... I was kind of expecting something like this, to be honest."
真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，目光稍稍移开，"嗯...说实话，我多少有点预料到会这样。"

"What." The flat stare that Asuka gave him started alarm bells ringing in his head.
"什么。" 明日香那平淡的目光让他心头警铃大作。

"I... I thought something was going to happen to stop us being able to go," he attempted to clarify.
"我...我总觉得会有什么事阻止我们出发，" 他试图解释道。

Asuka's voice went low and sibilant. "You knew about this? You knew and yet you left me to get psyched for the trip?!"
明日香的声音低沉而带有嘶嘶声。"你知道这件事？你明知道还让我一个人兴奋地准备旅行？"

With the sink at his back and Asuka in front of him, Shinji was trapped. He patted the air in front of him, trying to lean away from her as much as possible. "N-no! It was just a feeling I had! Me being pessimistic! I didn't want to bring you down just because I thought that something might happen!"
背靠着水槽，面前是明日香，真嗣无处可逃。他挥动双手，尽量往后靠，试图远离她。"不-不是的！那只是我的一种感觉！我比较悲观而已！我不想因为自己觉得可能会出事就扫了你的兴！"

Narrowing her eyes at him, Asuka remained silent for several long and tense seconds before abruptly about-facing and stomping off; the slam of her bedroom door told Shinji where she had retreated to. He remained where he was, hands still raised, for a short time afterwards before sighing and returning dejectedly to the sink.
明日香眯起眼睛盯着他，沉默了许久，气氛紧张。突然，她猛地转身，大步离开；卧室门的砰然关闭告诉真嗣她去了哪里。他仍站在原地，双手举着，过了一会儿才叹了口气，沮丧地回到水槽边。

Once again, he felt like he'd just damaged their relationship.
他再次感到自己似乎又损害了他们的关系。

He was letting the water out of the sink when a whisper from behind caught his ear.
他正从水槽里放水，突然背后传来一阵低语，让他耳朵一竖。

"Shinji." 真嗣。

Turning around, he saw Misato poking her head around the corner of the small hallway leading to the front door, waving at him to come closer. Puzzled at her presence in the apartment, Shinji made his way over to her.
他转过身，看见美里正从通往前门的小走廊拐角处探出头来，向他招手示意靠近。对她在公寓里的出现感到困惑，真嗣还是朝她走了过去。

"Don't take it personally," Misato said in a low voice as she moved towards the front door. "Asuka's really mad at me; you were just caught in the blast radius."
别往心里去，" 美里压低声音说着，朝前门走去。"明日香真的很生我的气；你只是被波及到了。

"Why are you-" 你为什么-

"I stuck around to see how she'd react," Misato swiftly answered, obviously expecting the question. "Sadly, she pretty much did what I expected. Just give her a little time to calm down. She should be fine tomorrow. Mostly. Well... she won't be hostile towards you at least."
我留下来是想看看她会怎么反应，" 美里迅速回答，显然预料到了这个问题。"可惜，她基本上如我所料。给她点时间冷静一下。她明天应该会好些。基本上。嗯...至少她不会对你有敌意。

Shinji glanced forlornly in the vague direction of Asuka's bedroom. "Are you sure? It seemed like I... betrayed her or something by not wanting to ruin her good mood."
真嗣忧郁地朝明日香卧室的大致方向瞥了一眼。"你确定吗？我总觉得我...好像背叛了她似的，因为我不想破坏她的好心情。"

"Trust me, Shinji. If you had really betrayed her, you'd know about it," Misato drily replied. "You, me, and the entire building. Tomorrow, she'll be venting to you about how I'm the worst person in the world or something. Don't try and defend me, by the way. Let her get it out."
相信我，真嗣。如果你真的背叛了她，你会知道的，" 美里干巴巴地回答道，"你，我，还有整栋楼的人。明天，她会向你抱怨我是世界上最糟糕的人之类的。顺便说一句，别试图为我辩护。让她发泄出来吧。

"Um... okay..." 嗯... 好吧...

"Now I'm gonna actually head off. Goodnight, Shinji."
现在我真的要走了。晚安，真嗣。

"Goodnight." 晚安。

XXX

Saturday morning did not get off to a good start for Shinji. Even the simple act of getting out of bed stymied him as he became tangled in the cord of his SDAT, which he had been listening to before falling asleep, as well as his bedcovers. He wound up flopping gracelessly onto the floor before he could untangle himself.
周六早晨对真嗣来说并不顺利。就连起床这件简单的事也让他陷入了困境，他在睡前听的 SDAT 耳机线缠住了他，还有床单。他最终笨拙地摔倒在地板上，才得以解开纠缠。

Breakfast was tense once again. While Asuka didn't say anything beyond a muttered morning greeting to Shinji, frustration was evident on her face. Once or twice he thought he caught her muttering Misato's name under her breath along with some less than flattering comments.
早餐再次充满了紧张气氛。尽管明日香除了对真嗣低声道了声早安外没再说什么，但她脸上的挫败感显而易见。有那么一两次，真嗣觉得他听到她在低声念叨着美里小姐的名字，夹杂着一些不那么恭维的评论。

The day wore on. School came and went, with Horaki expressing her disappointment at the pilots' inability to join the class in Okinawa. Toji was less sympathetic, and was suitably chastised by Horaki after a careless remark about the trip being more enjoyable without Asuka. That only gave her something else to mutter about as Shinji and Asuka walked home that afternoon.
日子就这样过去了。学校来了又去，班长洞木对驾驶员们无法与班级一起去冲绳表示失望。东治则不那么同情，他在一次关于没有明日香的旅行会更愉快的轻率言论后，被洞木适当地训斥了。这又给了明日香在那天下午真嗣和她一起走回家时嘟囔的新话题。

Asuka had just mentioned something about monkeys wearing tracksuits when Shinji realised that they weren't quite going home the same way as usual.
就在明日香刚提到猴子穿运动服的事情时，真嗣意识到他们回家的路线与往常不太一样。

"Got a problem with that?" Asuka testily asked when he brought it up. "I just felt like going a different way this time."
这有什么问题吗？" 当他说起这事时，明日香不耐烦地反问道，"我只是这次想走不同的路而已。

"Not at all," Shinji replied. "I was just curious if you were going to get something from a shop on the way home."
当然没有，" 真嗣回答道，"我只是好奇你是不是打算顺路从某个店里买点什么回家。

Asuka snorted in derision. "What, so Misato can ruin my enjoyment of it by saying that Eva pilots aren't allowed to have it?"
明日香嗤之以鼻，"怎么，好让美里来破坏我的兴致，说 EVA 驾驶员不能拥有它？"

Shinji, remembering Misato's advice, took a moment to clamp down on the first thing he was going to say. Instead, he said, "It's a shame we're the only pilots. I wouldn't have minded a little time off to wind down. Maybe go camping with Kensuke again." He blinked, looking around at suddenly familiar surroundings. "Hey, speaking of which, I think I know where we are now."
真嗣回想起美里的忠告，克制住自己原本想说的话，转而说道："可惜我们只有两个驾驶员。我倒不介意放个小假放松一下，或许可以再和洞木一起去露营。" 他眨了眨眼，环顾四周，突然意识到熟悉的景象，"嘿，说到这个，我想我知道我们现在在哪儿了。"

Hastily looking both ways for traffic, Shinji crossed the street to stand in front of the building he recognised. "This is the cinema I slept in," he noted aloud.
匆忙地左右看了看车流，碇真嗣穿过街道，站在他认出的那栋建筑前。“这就是我睡过的电影院，”他自言自语道。

"That time you ran off?" asked Asuka as she came up behind him. "Why did you sleep in a cinema?"
“那次你跑掉的时候？”明日香从他身后走来问道。“你为什么会在电影院睡觉？”

"Not intentionally," replied Shinji with a hint of embarrassment. "I was sort of half-watching a movie that was still playing while wondering where I should go. No idea what the movie was about, especially since I ended up falling asleep partway through."
“并非有意为之，”真嗣带着一丝尴尬回答。“我那时半心半意地看着还在放映的电影，同时思索着该去哪里。完全不知道那电影讲的是什么，尤其是因为我中途就睡着了。”

"Huh." Asuka looked up at the board displaying the films currently showing. Shinji saw her squint her eyes and silently mouth some words, before she turned back to him and said, "Eh, none of those sound very interesting. Let's get going."
“哼。”明日香抬头看向展示当前放映电影的告示牌。真嗣见她眯起眼睛，无声地动了动嘴唇，然后转回身对他说：“哎，这些听起来都没什么意思。我们走吧。”

Shinji nodded, mentally sighing with relief. Somehow, he'd managed to get Asuka's mind off disparaging Misato for the time being.
真嗣点了点头，内心松了一口气。不知怎的，他暂时让明日香不再对美里冷嘲热讽了。

He had no idea how long it would last though.
但他不知道这种情况能持续多久。

XXX

"This just isn't the same," Asuka complained. "Sure, it's bigger than I expected, but it's just so... bleh."
“这根本不一样，”明日香抱怨道，“虽然比我想象的要大，但就是……太没劲了。”

Shinji looked up and across the table at her, then at their surroundings. He was inclined to agree with his disgruntled friend; the Geofront pool area was little more than a hole full of water inside a sterile white box of a room. No effort had been made to make the place look even remotely inviting. The table and chairs they were currently using were likely spares from the cafeteria, considering they looked exactly the same, and there were no deck chairs for swimmers to relax in.
真嗣抬头望向桌子对面的她，又环顾四周。他倾向于同意这位不满的朋友；第三新东京市地下的泳池区不过是一个充满水的洞穴，位于一个毫无生气的白色房间内。这里丝毫没有营造出哪怕一丝的温馨氛围。他们现在使用的桌椅很可能是从食堂临时搬来的，因为它们看起来一模一样，而且也没有供游泳者休息的躺椅。

Rei didn't seem to care though, seeing as she had jumped into the pool moments after their arrival.
然而，零似乎并不在意，因为他们刚到不久，她就跳进了泳池。

"Problem is, it's either this or nothing," he said. "Unless you want to go swimming at school."
问题是，要么这样，要么什么都没有，"他说。"除非你想在学校游泳。

Asuka made a face. "Hell no. They probably wouldn't even let us in anyway."
明日香做了个鬼脸。"绝对不行。他们可能根本不会让我们进去。"

Shinji gave a hum of agreement before returning to his work. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Asuka stretch out languidly, the thin white cotton of her shirt doing nothing to hide the fact that she was wearing her newly bought bikini; a fact he struggled mightily to ignore. He himself was clad in a shirt and the board shorts Asuka had generously purchased for him, but he had no intention of getting into the pool.
真嗣发出一声赞同的哼声，然后继续他的工作。他用眼角余光注意到明日香慵懒地伸展着身体，她那件薄薄的白色棉质衬衫丝毫没有遮掩住她穿着新买的比基尼的事实；他努力地不去注意这一点。他自己穿着一件衬衫和明日香慷慨为他购买的沙滩裤，但他并没有打算下水。

With a sigh, Asuka ended the stretch by practically slumping over the papers in front of her before aimlessly grabbing at the pen that nearly rolled off the table. She missed, causing it to clatter onto the ground, and Shinji could sense her rolling her eyes as she leaned down to pick it up.
阿苏卡叹了口气，结束伸展动作后几乎瘫倒在面前的文件上，然后漫无目的地抓向那支差点滚下桌子的笔。她没抓住，笔哐啷一声掉在地上，真嗣能感觉到她在翻白眼，同时弯腰去捡。

Shinji idly tapped his own pen on the paper in front of him, trying to make sense of the subject matter. While he wasn't stupid, some things occasionally felt way beyond his mental reach. Like science.
真嗣无意识地用笔敲打着面前的纸张，试图理解课题内容。虽然他并不笨，但有些东西偶尔会让他觉得超出了自己的理解范围。比如科学。

"Problems?" Asuka piped up. Shinji looked up at her. "With your work I mean. You look like you want to just chuck the paper in a shredder."
遇到难题了？"阿苏卡插话道。真嗣抬头看向她。"我是说你的作业。你看起来恨不得把那张纸扔进碎纸机。

"Eh..." Shinji hesitated, before giving up. He certainly wasn't getting anywhere on his own. "It's this science thing. Thermal expansion or whatever. I just can't wrap my head around it."
呃..."真嗣犹豫了一下，最终放弃挣扎。他显然自己解决不了这个问题。"就是这科学的东西。热胀冷缩之类的。我就是搞不明白。

"You don't know what thermal expansion is?"
你不知道什么是热胀冷缩吗？

"Um... no?" Why he phrased it as a question, Shinji had no idea.
"呃...不知道？" 为什么他会用疑问的语气，真嗣自己也搞不清楚。

Asuka gave him a bemused smile. "Thermal expansion is when a material changes size due to fluctuations in temperature." She looked at him, to which he gave an unsure nod. "Okay, let me give you an example. Ever tried to open a jar only for the lid to apparently be glued on? The reason why is because the metal lid has cooled down and shrunk slightly. Putting it under hot water causes the lid to heat up, which makes it expand and lets you open the jar."
明日香带着一丝戏谑的微笑看着他。"热胀冷缩就是材料因为温度变化而改变大小的现象。" 她看着他，而他则有些不确定地点了点头。"好吧，我给你举个例子。你有没有试过打开一个罐子，却发现盖子好像被粘住了一样？那是因为金属盖子冷却后稍微收缩了。把盖子放在热水下，它就会受热膨胀，这样你就能打开罐子了。"

Shinji groaned in realisation. "Wish I'd known that when I was younger," he mused, recalling several times where he'd had to get his teacher to open a jar for him.
真嗣恍然大悟地叹了口气。"真希望我小时候就知道这个，" 他若有所思地说，回忆起好几次不得不请老师帮忙开罐子的情景。

"Thermal expansion is an important thing," Asuka continued. "Rail workers need to build train lines in such a way that the metal has room to safely expand, otherwise the tracks will warp in hot weather and trains could get derailed."
热胀冷缩是个重要现象，" 明日香继续说道，"铁路工人铺设轨道时必须考虑到金属在高温下的膨胀空间，否则轨道会在炎热天气中变形，导致火车脱轨。

He set upon the question that had held him up for so long, angry at himself for not being able to understand until it had been practically spelled out to him. When he was done, he looked at his answer, then up at Asuka. "Um, could you take a quick look at this just to make sure I got it right?"
他着手解决那个困扰他许久的问题，对自己直到问题几乎被明示才恍然大悟感到懊恼。完成后，他审视了一遍答案，然后抬头看向明日香，"呃，你能快速帮我检查一下，确保我做对了吗？"

A look passed over her face, coming and going so quick that Shinji wasn't quite sure he'd seen anything at all, let alone what it signified. She blinked a couple of times, then said, "Sure, pass it over."
她的脸上闪过一丝表情，快得让真嗣几乎怀疑自己是否真的看到了什么，更别说那表情意味着什么了。她眨了几下眼，然后说："当然，递过来吧。"

He slid the paper over to Asuka's side of the table, then watched as she hunched over it. When she began to silently mouth the words, a worrying thought occurred; one that he could not bring himself to say out loud.
他将纸张推到明日香那边的桌面上，随后注视着她俯身查看。当她开始默默地动嘴唇念出字句时，一个令人担忧的念头浮现心头；那是一个他无法开口说出的想法。

"Yeah, that's good," Asuka suddenly said, passing the sheet back to him. Just as suddenly, she slid her chair back and got to her feet. "Anyway, I think we've done enough work to earn a bit of a swim."
嗯，挺好的，"明日香突然说道，将纸张递还给他。紧接着，她猛地向后一推椅子，站了起来。"总之，我觉得我们已经干了足够的活，该去游会儿泳了。

"You can go on without me," Shinji hastily replied, looking down at his work as Asuka removed her shirt.
"你先去吧，不用等我，"真嗣急忙回答，目光落在自己的工作上，而明日香正脱下她的衬衫。

As it turned out, taking his eyes off her was probably a bad thing to do. Moments later, he felt two arms swiftly wrap around him from behind and lift him bodily from his seat.
事实证明，把视线从她身上移开可能是个糟糕的决定。片刻之后，他感觉到两条手臂迅速从背后环抱住他，将他从座位上举了起来。

"It's just a bit of swimming," said the owner of the arms as she marched him over to the edge of the pool where she let go. Shinji turned around and was about to give Asuka a perfectly good reason why he didn't want to go in the pool, when he briefly felt two hands push him backwards.
"不过是游个泳而已，"手臂的主人边说边把他带到泳池边，然后松开了手。真嗣转过身，正要向明日香解释他为何不想下水，却突然感到两只手在他背后一推。

Time seemed to slow down. It seemed like Shinji was falling forever, staring at the grin on Asuka's face as she ever-so-slowly put her hands on her hips. His back soon felt the chill of the pool water, and he had just enough sense left to hold his breath as time sped up again. He scrunched his eyes closed as he sank into the pool. Panic set in, and he began to flail wildly, not even knowing which way was up.
时间仿佛放慢了脚步。真嗣感觉自己似乎在永远地下坠，凝视着明日香脸上那抹缓缓绽放的笑容，她双手慢慢叉在腰间。他的背部很快感受到了池水的寒意，仅存的理智让他及时屏住了呼吸，时间随即又恢复了正常的流速。他紧闭双眼，沉入池中，恐慌袭来，开始疯狂挣扎，甚至分不清哪边是水面。

With much of the air in his lungs lost to the forceful shove, Shinji's chest quickly began to ache. A hand bumped against something, but with his eyes closed he couldn't tell if it was the side of the pool or the bottom.
由于被猛力一推，真嗣肺中的空气大量流失，胸口迅速开始疼痛。一只手碰到了什么东西，但闭着眼睛的他无法判断那是池壁还是池底。

Just as Shinji was about to resign himself to oblivion, an arm wrapped around his midsection and he felt himself turned around and pulled through the water. Seconds later, his head broke the surface and he gasped a welcome lungful of air.
就在真嗣即将放弃希望之际，一只手臂环住了他的腰腹，他感到自己被转了个身，拖着穿过水流。几秒钟后，他的头冒出水面，大口吸入了渴望已久的空气。

"Are you alright, Shinji?" Rei asked right next to his ear, and he nodded in response.
"你还好吗，真嗣？" 零在他耳边问道，他点了点头作为回应。

"Shit shit shit!" 糟糕糟糕糟糕！

Asuka's voice drew near, along with the slapping of bare feet on concrete. Rei pulled Shinji towards the side of the pool, where familiar hands grabbed him under his arms and pulled him out of the water. The moment he was on dry lands he laid himself down, still breathing heavily as his body worked to recover from its near-death experience. He rubbed at his eyelids, trying to remove any trace of the pool, before blearily opening his eyes to see a shock of red hair framing a worried face.
明日香的呼声渐近，伴随着赤脚踏在混凝土上的啪嗒声。绫波拉着真嗣朝泳池边靠去，那里有熟悉的手抓住他的腋下，将他从水中拽出。一踏上干地，他便瘫倒在地，呼吸急促，身体还在从濒死体验中恢复。他揉搓着眼睛，试图抹去任何池水的痕迹，然后昏昏沉沉地睁开眼，看到一抹红发映衬着一张担忧的脸庞。

Their eyes met and Asuka closed hers, sighing in relief. "Damnit, Shinji..." she mumbled. "You could have said you didn't know how to swim."
两人的目光交汇，明日香闭上眼睛，松了口气。"该死的，真嗣……"她喃喃道，"你本可以告诉我你不会游泳的。"

"I was... just about to when you pushed me in," Shinji weakly retorted.
"我正……要告诉你，你就把我推进去了，"真嗣无力地反驳道。

"In the future, I would appreciate it if you did not act so recklessly with a fellow pilot's life," Rei interjected, causing the others to look at her.
"今后，如果你能不再如此鲁莽地对待一位同僚的生命，我将不胜感激。" 绫波插话道，引得其他人纷纷看向她。

Asuka shrugged expansively. "I just thought he was being stubborn about getting his work done!"
明日香大大地耸了耸肩。"我只是觉得他非要把工作做完，太固执了！"

Rei simply gave her a frosty look before turning around and diving back into the pool with almost no splash. Shinji, now mostly recovered, sat up and idly watched her continue her laps. After a moment of awkward silence, he looked up at Asuka, still sitting by his side. Now seemed as good a time as any.
绫波只是冷冷地看了她一眼，随即转身，几乎无声地再次潜入泳池，继续她的往返游。真嗣此时已大致恢复，坐起身来，漫不经心地看着她继续游动。片刻尴尬的沉默后，他抬头望向仍坐在他身旁的明日香。现在似乎是个开口的好时机。

"Speaking of things we don't know..."
说到我们不了解的事情……

Asuka's head reared back slightly, suspicion on her face. "...What?"
明日香的头部微微后仰，脸上带着怀疑。“...什么？”

"You're having trouble reading kanji, aren't you?"
“你在读汉字时遇到困难了，对吧？”

What followed was about half a minute of embarrassed stuttering and denials from a red-faced Asuka. When she saw that nothing she said was dispelling Shinji's scepticism, she gave up with a groan.
接下来大约半分钟，明日香满脸通红，尴尬地结巴着否认。当她意识到自己说什么都无法消除真嗣的怀疑时，她只好呻吟一声放弃了。

"Fine, yes, I'm having some trouble," she grouched. "Happy?"
“好吧，是的，我确实有些困难，”她抱怨道。“满意了？”

Shinji frowned and shook his head. "Why would I be happy about that? Are you happy that I can't swim?"
真嗣皱起眉头，摇了摇头。“我为什么要为此感到高兴？你难道因为我不会游泳而高兴吗？”

"No, but..." Words seemingly failing Asuka, she settled for looking away and crossing her arms.
“不，但是...”似乎词穷的明日香，最终选择转过头去，双臂交叉。

"All you need to do is ask for help," Shinji reasoned. "I'm not happy that you're struggling, but I'd be glad to assist."
“你只需要开口求助就行，”真嗣解释道，“我并不是因为你遇到困难而高兴，但我很乐意帮忙。”

Asuka glanced at him, narrowing her eyes. "And what about you? You could have asked me to teach you to swim instead of making me think you already knew."
明日香瞥了他一眼，眯起眼睛。“那你呢？你本可以让我教你游泳，而不是让我误以为你已经会了。”

"I didn't say anything because I just don't care for swimming."
我没说什么，因为我就是不喜欢游泳。

"Care or not, it's still a useful and important skill to learn." Asuka got to her feet and looked down at him, offering a hand.
"不管你喜不喜欢，游泳仍然是一项有用且重要的技能。" 明日香站起身，低头看着他，伸出手来。

Shinji took the hand, rapidly rising to his feet as Asuka pulled him upward. "So is being able to read kanji," he countered.
真嗣握住她的手，随着明日香的拉力迅速站了起来。"能读汉字也很重要，"他反驳道。

Asuka threw her hands up. "Fine, how about this then? I teach you to swim, you help me out with reading your weird language. Swimming's good exercise anyway."
明日香双手一摊。"好吧，这样如何？我教你游泳，你帮我提高阅读你那奇怪语言的能力。游泳反正也是很好的锻炼。"

Shinji sighed in defeat. "Alright, I suppose."
真嗣无奈地叹了口气。“好吧，也只能这样了。”

"Oh relax," Asuka airily replied as she turned to head back to their table. "Honestly, being a male, you're getting the better end of this deal by far."
“哎呀，放松点，”明日香轻快地回答，转身朝他们的桌子走去。“说真的，作为男生，你在这件事上可是占了大便宜。”

"What do you mean? By learning how to swim?"
“你指的是什么？学游泳吗？”

Asuka opened her mouth to retort, but then slowly closed it as she ruefully shook her head. "You're hopeless sometimes, Shinji."
明日香本想反驳，但随即缓缓合上嘴巴，苦笑着摇了摇头。“你有时候真是无可救药，真嗣。”

### Chapter 19 Sandalphon

Misato suppressed a smile as her car pulled up to the security gate and the bored guard in the tiny booth hastily got to his feet. She knew well the crushing tedium of guard duty in a quiet area; perhaps her NERV-issued black sedan with its front seats occupied by serious-looking men in dark suits would give him something to think about for a little while. She wondered what the man would think of her as she stepped out of the car and strode imperiously up to him. His gaze certainly lingered on her chest for a couple seconds too long before snapping up to her face.
碇真嗣抑制住笑意，当她的车驶近安检门时，那个在小亭子里百无聊赖的警卫匆忙站起身来。她深知在宁静区域担任警卫的枯燥乏味；或许她那辆 NERV 发放的黑色轿车，前排坐着两位神情严肃、身着深色西装的男士，能让他稍微有点思考的素材。她好奇当她下车，昂首阔步走向他时，这位警卫会如何看待她。他的目光确实在她胸前停留了两秒过久，才匆忙上移至她的脸庞。

"Er... sorry ma'am," he nervously began, "but this area is off-limits. Unless you have authorisation from-"
呃...对不起，女士，"他紧张地开口，"但这个区域是禁区。除非您有来自...的授权。

"Which would you like to see first?" Misato cut in. "My NERV ID or the research team's written authorisation?"
您想先看哪个？"碇真嗣打断他，"我的 NERV 身份证，还是研究团队的书面授权？

"NERV?" The poor young man gulped, giving a quick glance over his shoulder at Mount Asama, or rather at the pre-fab buildings near its base. "Oh shit... um... There's nothing I can do to keep you out anyway, is there?"
NERV？"可怜的年轻人咽了口唾沫，迅速回头瞥了一眼浅间山，或者更确切地说，是山脚附近的预制建筑。"哦，糟糕...呃...无论如何，我也拦不住您，对吧？

"Nope!" Misato's response was perhaps a little too cheerful. "If I really had to I could borrow some armour from the JSSDF, bull-rush my way in and take over in less than half an hour. Nobody would be able to do anything about it. But we're all friends here, right? We were asked to come here."
没门！" 葛城美里的回答或许过于欢快了些。"如果真有必要，我可以从日本自卫队借些装甲，强行冲进去，半小时内就能接管一切。没人能阻止得了。但我们都是朋友，对吧？我们是受邀而来的。

"Yeah... alright..." 嗯...好吧...

The guard barely even glanced at the authorisation and simply retreated to his booth to open the gate, staring pensively at the car as it drove off.
那名守卫几乎没怎么看授权文件，就径直退回岗亭打开了大门，若有所思地目送着车辆驶离。

The other rear passenger in the car adjusted the satchel in his lap, glancing at Misato as they neared the pre-fabs. "You could have just shown the papers right from the start instead of scaring the boy."
车上的另一位后排乘客调整了一下腿上的挎包，接近预制房时瞥了葛城美里一眼。"你本可以一开始就出示文件，而不是吓唬那个小伙子。"

"But where's the fun in that, Makoto?" Misato responded with a cheeky grin.
"但那样多没意思啊，真嗣？" 葛城美里带着俏皮的笑容回应道。

Once past the gate, the NERV sedan's occupants may as well have been part of the survey team for all the attention they got. Nobody spared them so much as a look as they went about their duties, leaving them free to head straight for their destination: the largest pre-fab in this scientific hamlet. The escorts remained by the car as Misato and Makoto headed into a brightly lit building with computer screens set up along most of the walls.
一过闸门，NERV 的轿车里的人仿佛就成了勘察队的一部分，根本无人理睬。他们忙于自己的事务，连看都不看一眼，任由他们直奔目的地——这个科学村落中最大的预制建筑。随行人员留在车旁，而葛城和真嗣则走进了一座灯火通明的大楼，里面大部分墙壁都装有电脑屏幕。

A few of the boffins looked up at her sudden appearance and quickly went back to their own work, but one man stood up and walked over to her.
几位科研人员抬头瞥见她突然出现，又迅速埋头于自己的工作，但有一位男士站起身，向她走来。

"Captain Katsuragi? I'm Professor Toshi Akita. Sorry to drag you out for something that might be nothing, but... better safe than sorry, yeah?"
葛城上尉吗？我是秋田俊博教授。抱歉为了可能无足轻重的事把你叫出来，但... 宁可谨慎有余，对吧？

Misato nodded. "We'll need to hook up a little something of our own to your system here. I trust that won't be a problem?"
碇真嗣点了点头。“我们需要在你的系统里接入一点我们自己的东西。我相信这不会是问题吧？”

Akita anxiously rubbed the back of his head. "I suppose. You'd probably just go ahead and do it anyway."
秋田紧张地搓着后脑勺。“我想也是。反正你们大概也会直接动手做。”

"Yes, but I'm doing the polite thing and asking nicely first." At the professor's sceptical glance, she hastily amended her statement. "Nicely for NERV at least."
“是的，但我还是礼貌地先征求了你的意见。”看到教授怀疑的眼神，她急忙补充道，“至少是以 NERV 的方式礼貌。”

Misato glanced at Makoto, who nodded and tugged a chunky laptop out of his satchel. A piece of paper fluttered out as well, and Misato picked it up. It contained clear, simple instructions for how to set up the laptop; clearly Ritsuko had decided to take no chances with Misato.
碇真嗣瞥了一眼真嗣，后者点了点头，从背包里拽出一台厚重的笔记本电脑。一张纸随之飘落，碇真嗣捡了起来。上面清晰简洁地写着如何设置电脑的步骤；显然，律子决定对碇真嗣不抱任何侥幸心理。

"Alright," said Misato to Akita once Makoto had hooked the laptop up. "Let's go over what caused this matter to be brought to our attention."
好了，" 碇真嗣将笔记本电脑连接好后，葛城美里对秋田说道，"我们来回顾一下是什么原因导致这件事引起了我们的注意。

According to the head researcher, seismic disturbances had been detected in Mount Asama a couple of weeks ago, and a team had been swiftly assembled amidst concerns that a massive eruption similar to the Tenmei 3 disaster in 1783 might occur. When a probe had been lowered into the magma, it had just barely picked up a strange object before succumbing to heat and pressure. Now the team was preparing to lower a more powerful and rugged probe to investigate what the previous one had found.
据首席研究员所述，几周前在浅间山检测到了地震扰动，由于担心可能发生类似 1783 年天明 3 号灾难的巨大喷发，迅速组建了一支团队。当探测器被放入岩浆时，它刚好在承受高温和压力之前捕捉到了一个奇怪的物体。现在，团队正准备放下一个更强大、更坚固的探测器，以调查前一个探测器所发现的东西。

Misato stared at the single picture the original probe had managed to capture milliseconds before its destruction. While the picture was incredibly grainy and distorted, it was still possible to make out the perfectly ovoid object floating in magma that had drawn the suspicion of NERV.
葛城美里凝视着原始探测器在毁灭前几毫秒内捕捉到的唯一一张照片。尽管照片极其模糊且失真，但仍能辨认出漂浮在岩浆中的完美椭圆形物体，这引起了 NERV 的怀疑。

But one picture wasn't enough. This second probe, along with the MAGI uplink via the laptop, would confirm whether or not the disturbance and the ovoid object were Angelic in origin. An idea was already stirring in Misato's head on what to do if it was.
但一张照片远远不够。这第二个探测器，连同通过笔记本电脑进行的 MAGI 上行链路，将确认扰动和椭圆形物体是否具有使徒的性质。葛城美里心中已经有了一个想法，如果真是如此，她知道该如何应对。

The noise in the room picked up as the operation began.
随着行动的开始，房间里的噪音逐渐增大。

"You're doing really well, Shinji," Asuka complimented as she passed him a towel.
"你做得真不错，真嗣，" 明日香赞许地说着，递给他一条毛巾。

"Thanks," Shinji replied, taking the towel and wiping his face clean of pool water before draping it over his shoulders and heading over to the table. He sat down heavily on a chair, tired after Asuka's latest swim training session but less fatigued than he had been at the start of the week. The moment Asuka had deemed his swimming ability competent, she had immediately decided it was a good excuse to take more breaks from studying.
"谢谢，" 真嗣接过毛巾，擦去脸上的泳池水，然后搭在肩上，走向桌子。他重重地坐在椅子上，经过明日香最新的游泳训练后感到疲惫，但比起一周初已经不那么累了。一旦明日香认为他的游泳技能过关，她便立刻以此为由，决定多休息，少学习。

But they didn't slack off; Shinji held up his end of the bargain and helped Asuka brush up on her kanji. Her genius intellect shone through as she rapidly brought herself up to speed, even if she did occasionally try to declare impromptu swim breaks.
但他们并未懈怠；真嗣履行了自己的承诺，帮助明日香复习汉字。她的天才智慧显露无疑，迅速赶上了进度，尽管偶尔她还是会试图宣布临时游泳休息。

Throughout the week, Rei would sometimes appear in the pool area, nod a greeting to the other two pilots and proceed to swim for an indeterminate amount of time before vanishing just as quietly. The only time she stuck around was when Asuka, having prepared some lunch that morning, insisted that Rei join them.
整个星期里，绫波不时会出现在泳池区域，向另外两位驾驶员点头致意后，便开始游泳，时间长短不定，然后又悄然消失。她唯一停留的时候，是明日香那天早上准备了午餐，坚持要绫波加入他们。

On that occasion, she ended up aiding in Asuka's kanji revision by bluntly correcting an error Shinji had made, at which point Shinji began worrying that he'd made more mistakes. Only after going over their past work had Rei been able to assure him that that had been his only mistake.
那次，她帮助明日香复习汉字，直截了当地纠正了真嗣犯的一个错误，这让真嗣开始担心自己是否还犯了更多错误。直到回顾了他们以往的作业，绫波才让他确信那只是他唯一的错误。

When Rei showed up today, however, it was not to swim.
然而，今天绫波出现时，并非为了游泳。

Shinji was first to notice, seeing that she was in her plugsuit. "Is there a test or something today?" he asked.
真嗣最先注意到，她穿着插入栓服。“今天有什么测试吗？”他问道。

"No," Rei replied. "I have been asked to collect you two for a mission."
不，" 绫波回答道，"我被派来召集你们两位执行任务。

Asuka got up out of her seat. "Mission?!" she echoed, sounding almost joyful. "But... wait, there's been no alarm for an attack."
明日香从座位上站了起来。"任务？！"她重复道，声音中几乎带着喜悦。"但是……等等，并没有响起攻击警报啊。"

Rei turned around and headed for the entrance. "I will leave the details for Doctor Akagi," she said before exiting the room.
绫波转身朝入口走去。"详情我会留给赤木博士解释，"她说完便离开了房间。

Shinji stared for a moment after she departed, before sighing and standing up. "Guess we better head to the changing rooms," he said as he made to follow Rei. He had just made it to the entrance when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder.
真嗣在她离开后愣了一会儿，随后叹了口气站起身。"看来我们得去更衣室了，"他说着准备跟随绫波。刚走到入口处，他感到一只坚定的手搭在了他的肩膀上。

"There's plugsuits for us in the change rooms here, genius."
这里的更衣室有给我们准备的插入栓服，真是天才。

"...Oh." ...哦。

XXX

Mere minutes later, Shinji and Asuka arrived at the command centre. Rei was already there, patiently waiting with hands clasped behind her back. Doctor Akagi looked up from where she had been staring at Lieutenant Ibuki's terminal over the woman's shoulder.
几分钟后，真嗣和明日香抵达指挥中心。绫波已经等在那里，双手背在身后，耐心地等待着。赤木博士从她之前盯着伊吹少尉的终端机的地方抬起头来。

"I suppose you're wondering why there's been no alarm," Akagi said by way of greeting. At Shinji's puzzled nod, she continued. "Well there's definitely an Angel, but currently it's in no position to do anything."
我想你们一定在纳闷为什么没有警报响起，"赤木以此作为问候。看到真嗣困惑地点头，她继续说道，"确实有一个使徒，但目前它没有任何行动能力。

An image flashed up on the holographic screen in front of the bridge crew. A reddish oval dominated most of the picture, with something skeletal inside it. Shinji frowned as he tried to make sense of what he was seeing: it looked almost human.
舰桥前方的全息屏幕上突然闪现出一幅图像。一个红色的椭圆形占据了画面的大部分，里面似乎有什么骨架状的东西。真嗣皱着眉头，试图理解他所看到的：那东西看起来几乎像人。

"That's the Angel?!" Asuka's tone of voice conveyed Shinji's thoughts rather well. This had to be some kind of hoax.
"那就是使徒？！"明日香的语气很好地传达了真嗣的想法。这一定是某种恶作剧。

Akagi took one look at Asuka's expression and said, "Before you say anything else, yes it's real. The MAGI have confirmed the Pattern Blue."
赤木瞥了一眼明日香的表情，说道："在你再说什么之前，是的，它是真的。MAGI 已经确认了蓝色模式。"

Asuka raised her hands over her head in mock surrender. "Fine. It's real. Whatever, I'll go step on an egg thing if you like. Where is it?"
明日香举起双手，做出投降的姿态。"好吧。它是真的。无所谓，如果你喜欢，我会去踩那个蛋一样的东西。它在哪儿？"

A chuckle escaped Akagi's lips as the holographic screen changed. "There you go, just jump right in there."
当全息屏幕变换时，赤木轻笑出声：“看，直接跳进去吧。”

Shinji blinked at the new image. "Is that... Mount Asama?"
真嗣对着新图像眨了眨眼。“那是……浅间山吗？”

"The volcano?" Asuka incredulously added. "What's an Angel doing in there? How?!"
“火山？”明日香难以置信地追问，“使徒怎么会在那里？怎么可能？！”

"We don't know," Akagi admitted. "But considering it appears to be in an embryonic state, NERV is going to try and make the first move this time. Misato's already on-site with the research team, and she made the suggestion that we attempt to capture the Angel before it can attack."
“我们也不清楚，”赤木承认道，“但考虑到它似乎处于胚胎状态，这次 NERV 打算先发制人。美里已经带着研究小组在现场了，她建议我们在使徒发起攻击前尝试捕捉它。”

"And just how are we going to do that?" Asuka folded her arms as she stared at the volcano. "As good as they are, I'm pretty sure an Eva wouldn't last long in magma." She briefly unfolded her arms to absently rub at her chest, remembering the heat of Ramiel's beam.
"那我们究竟要怎么做到这一点呢？" 明日香双臂交叉，凝视着火山。"尽管它们很强大，但我确信，如果进入岩浆，Eva 也撑不了多久。" 她短暂地松开手臂，不经意地揉了揉胸口，回忆起雷米尔光束的热度。

"No, but we do have something special for just such an occasion," Akagi replied. "In fact, the preparations are already nearly finished."
不，但我们确实为此类情况准备了特别的东西，" 赤木博士回答道。"事实上，准备工作已经接近完成了。

"How is it going to be possible to get an Eva into magma?" Shinji wondered aloud.
"怎么可能让 Eva 进入岩浆呢？" 真嗣不禁自言自语。

Akagi sighed. "I'll explain, if you two will let me finish," she said, causing Shinji to flush with embarrassment. "Unit-02 will be the one to go into the volcano, as the modifications will only fit on that Eva-"
赤木叹了口气。"如果你们俩能让我说完，我会解释的，" 她说道，让真嗣尴尬得脸红。"Unit-02 将是进入火山的那台，因为只有这台 Eva 能适配那些改造——"

"Excuse me?!" Asuka harshly interrupted. "What are you doing to my Unit-02?!"
你说什么?!" 明日香厉声打断道。"你们对我的二号机做了什么?!

Akagi, somewhat put off by Asuka's response, groaned heavily. "Okay, maybe 'modification' is the wrong word. We're going to put Unit-02 into a specialised dive suit that will be able to withstand the heat and pressure long enough to finish this mission. Afterwards, 'your' Eva will be back to normal."
赤木，对明日香的反应有些不悦，沉重地叹了口气。"好吧，也许'改造'这个词不太恰当。我们打算给二号机穿上一种特制的潜水服，它能承受足够长时间的高温和压力，以完成这次任务。之后，'你的'Eva 就会恢复原样。"

Shinji didn't fail to notice the emphasis Akagi put on that word. Certainly, the Evangelions didn't belong to their pilots at all, but Asuka was clearly extremely protective of the one assigned to her. He wondered briefly if fighter pilots had the same attachment to their aircraft.
真嗣没有忽略赤木在那个词上所加的重音。确实，这些 Eva 根本不属于它们的驾驶员，但明日香显然对分配给她的那台极为珍视。他短暂地想，战斗机飞行员是否也会对自己的飞机有同样的依恋。

"Anyway, if I may be allowed to continue?" Akagi gave Asuka a look that could have frozen the lava in the volcano. When no answer was forthcoming, she continued. "Right. Mount Asama is some distance from Tokyo-3, so we'll need to split our forces a bit. Rei and Unit-00 will be staying behind to guard the city in case of another Angel appearing. Units 01 and 02 will be deployed at the volcano, with Unit-01 being on standby for support. Now then, a decision needs to be made.
"那么，我可以继续了吗？" 赤木给了明日香一个冷若冰霜的眼神，足以冻结火山中的熔岩。见无人回应，她继续说道。"好的。浅间山离第三新东京市有一段距离，所以我们需要分散一些力量。零和零号机会留下来守卫城市，以防出现另一个使徒。一号机和二号机将被部署在火山，其中一号机作为后备支援。现在，需要做出一个决定。

"Both of you are capable of piloting Unit-01 and Unit-02. It would take too long to build a power station out near Mount Asama, so the best we can do on short notice is the mobile batteries you had for the Seventh Angel. That, combined with the fact that trying to use an AT-Field in magma would result in ludicrous power drain, means that AT-Fields are not an option for this mission. Therefore, either of you can go into the volcano. So which of you wants to be the magma diver? I'll give you a couple of minutes to argue with each other."
你们俩都能驾驶零号机和二号机。在浅间山附近建造发电站耗时太长，所以短期内我们能做的就是使用对抗第七使徒时的移动电池。再加上试图在岩浆中使用 AT 力场会导致巨大的能量消耗，这意味着 AT 力场在这项任务中不可行。因此，你们中的任何一人都可以进入火山。那么，谁愿意成为岩浆潜水员呢？我给你们几分钟时间互相争论一下。

Shinji exhaled deeply as he turned and took a few steps away while rubbing the back of his neck. There was a dangerous task in store, as always with NERV, but this time there was something just as deadly even without an Angel involved.
真嗣深吸一口气，转身走了几步，同时揉着后颈。和往常一样，NERV 的任务总是充满危险，但这次即使没有使徒参与，也存在着同样的致命风险。

"Obviously it's gotta be me down there," Asuka said, stalking up to stand in his path. "I'm the more experienced of the two of us."
显然应该是我下去，"明日香说着，走上前挡在他面前。"我们俩中我更有经验。

Part of Shinji wanted him to just concede the point, let her go and be glad it wasn't him taking a swim in magma. But at the same time...
真嗣内心的一部分想要直接认输，让她去，庆幸自己不用在岩浆中游泳。但同时...

"My sync ratio in Unit-02 isn't as good as yours," Shinji began, "but it's going to be tough to move in magma anyway, right?"
我在二号机的同步率不如你，" 真嗣开口道，"但在岩浆里移动肯定也很困难吧？

"Indeed," Doctor Akagi piped up, glancing over her shoulder at them. "Next to impossible to fight effectively. But all you'd need to do is sit in the Eva and activate the capture device once you're in range of the Angel. Even if we could also add C-Type equipment to Unit-02, magma's too viscous for it to function effectively."
确实如此，" 赤木博士插话道，回头瞥了他们一眼。"在岩浆中战斗几乎是不可能的。但你所需要做的，只是坐在 EVA 里，一旦进入天使的捕捉范围就启动捕捉装置。即便我们能给二号机也加装 C 型装备，岩浆的粘稠度也使其难以有效运作。

"I can do that just fine," said Shinji, turning back to Asuka. "Your skill would be wasted on something like that."
那对我来说没问题，" 真嗣转向明日香说，"你这样的技术去做那种事就太浪费了。

"He's got a point," Doctor Akagi admitted. "If the Angel tries to escape or attack when it gets to the surface, you'd be more capable of dealing with it, Asuka."
他说得有道理，" 赤木博士承认道，"如果天使试图逃脱或在到达地表时发动攻击，你将更能应对，明日香。

"What if something happens down there?" Asuka retorted, ignoring the scientist. "Would you be able to handle the Angel if it breaks free?"
万一下面出事了怎么办？" 明日香反驳道，没理会那位科学家。"如果使徒挣脱了，你能对付得了吗？

Shinji gestured at the screen, which had returned to showing the photo taken by the probe. "It's an egg! How could that pose a threat?"
真嗣指着屏幕，上面已经重新显示了探测器拍摄的照片。"那是个蛋！怎么可能构成威胁？"

"It could hatch!" 它可能会孵化！

"And then it's just a tiny thing I could kill by squeezing it in my hand!"
然后就只是个小东西，我一捏就能弄死它！

"Keep in mind, you two, that this is still an Angel," Doctor Akagi said in a rebuking tone. "We don't know enough about them. For all we know it can grow to the size of its brethren in seconds."
记住，你们两个，这仍然是一只天使，"赤木博士用责备的口吻说道，"我们对它们了解得还不够。天知道它会不会在几秒钟内长到和它的同类一样大。

Asuka sighed and rubbed her eyes with her thumb and forefinger. "Shinji, why are you so adamant about you being the one to go down there?"
明日香叹了口气，用拇指和食指揉了揉眼睛。"真嗣，你为什么这么坚持要自己下去呢？"

"Because I'm the less valuable one!"
因为我是价值更小的一个！

The next thing Shinji knew, his left cheek had erupted in pain and he was stumbling sideways into a wall. He scrabbled at it as he tried to maintain his balance, his rubber-clad feet barely managing to gain purchase on the metal floor. The command centre had fallen silent, all eyes wide and focused on the teenagers. Even Rei was staring at them with a frown marring her normally-stoic face. Shinji felt like he was in a zoo as he brought up a hand to cover the cheek that Asuka had just violently slapped. She was still holding the offending hand up in the air, her body stock still but something akin to rage boiling on her face.
接下来的一瞬间，真嗣感到左脸颊一阵剧痛，身体不由自主地向一侧墙壁倾斜。他挣扎着试图保持平衡，橡胶包裹的脚在金属地板上几乎抓不住。指挥中心陷入了沉默，所有人的目光都睁得大大的，聚焦在这两个少年身上。就连平时面无表情的绫波也皱着眉头盯着他们。真嗣感觉自己就像在动物园里，他举起一只手捂住刚刚被明日香猛烈扇过的脸颊。她仍然高举着那只冒犯的手，身体僵硬，但脸上却涌动着近乎愤怒的情绪。

"Don't... ever say something like that again, Third," she said in the most venomous tone Shinji had ever heard from her. Before he could reply, she stomped towards him until their faces were only centimetres apart. "You want to be point man on this mission? Fine, but don't say that it's because you're expendable."
别...再那样说了，真嗣，"她用真嗣从未听过的最毒辣的语气说道。他还没来得及回应，她就大步向他走来，直到两人的脸相距仅几厘米。"你想在这任务中打头阵？行，但别说是因为你可有可无。

"Asuka-" 明日香——

"That kind of attitude is going to get you killed, Ikari," Asuka continued, refusing to let him speak. "And I will not let you throw your life away just because you don't value it!" She placed her hands on his shoulders and shoved herself away from him, rapping his head against the wall. "Now get your fucking head in the game and head to the cages."
那种态度会害死你的，碇，"明日香继续说道，不给他插话的机会。"我不会让你因为不珍惜自己的生命而白白送死！"她双手搭在他的肩上，用力将自己推开，使他的头撞到了墙上。"现在把你的脑袋调整好，去机库。

She stormed out of the command centre, leaving it silent for several long seconds before low conversation began to fill the room again. Shinji let out a breath he didn't realise he'd been holding, then slunk towards the exit. His pace quickened once he was in the hallway, and he caught up to Asuka at the entrance to the Evangelion cages.
她怒气冲冲地离开了指挥中心，留下一片寂静，过了好一会儿，低声交谈才再次充满房间。真嗣吐出一口他没意识到自己一直憋着的气，然后悄悄向出口走去。一到走廊，他的步伐就加快了，在 EVA 机库入口处赶上了明日香。

And as he stepped through the doorway, he saw just why she had come to a halt.
当他跨过门槛，便立刻明白了她为何会突然停下脚步。

"What the goddamn hell is this?!"
这他妈的到底是什么鬼东西？！

Shinji stared in astonishment. Rather than the imposing red giant he was expecting, there was instead an almost comically fat white diving suit, with the head of Unit-02 barely visible through the helmet's visor.
真嗣惊讶地瞪大了眼睛。眼前并非他预想中威严的红色巨人，而是一套几乎滑稽的肥胖白色潜水服，二号机的头部仅能透过头盔的护目镜隐约可见。

"That is the D-Type equipment," said Akagi, who had apparently followed the two pilots all the way here. Shinji and Asuka both turned to look at her, and Shinji noticed that Rei had also tagged along. "This suit can protect an Eva from heat, pressure and radiation."
那是 D 型装备，"赤木说道，显然她一路跟随两位驾驶员来到了这里。真嗣和明日香同时转头看向她，真嗣注意到绫波也跟了过来。"这套装备能保护 Eva 免受高温、压力和辐射的伤害。

"Not to mention good taste," Asuka grumbled. "It looks hideous!"
更别提什么好品味了，" 明日香嘟囔道，"简直丑死了！

"Well then it's a good thing you're not the one taking the dive," Akagi cheerfully replied. "Speaking of which... Shinji, I appreciate that you got changed before coming here, but you'll need a specialised plugsuit while you're on this mission. There's one waiting for you in the change room nearby."
那倒是，幸好不是你来跳这个坑，" 赤木高兴地回应，"说到这个... 真嗣，感谢你来之前换了衣服，但执行这次任务你需要一件专门的插入栓服。更衣室附近已经为你准备了一件。

Shinji blinked. "Oh, okay," he said before squeezing past Akagi and Rei to head to the change room.
真嗣眨了眨眼，"哦，好的，" 他说完便挤过赤木和绫波，朝更衣室走去。

Once he got there, he found two packaged plugsuits sitting on a bench, labelled 'Soryu' and 'Ikari'. Remembering what happened last time he'd used one of Asuka's plugsuits, Shinji made absolutely sure to grab the right one. He stripped out of the evidently useless plugsuit suit and into the new one, wondering just what the difference was. To Shinji's eyes it looked exactly the same, and he gave a mental shrug as he returned to the cage.
到了那里，他发现长凳上放着两件包装好的插入栓服，分别标着'惣流'和'碇'。想起上次误穿了明日香的插入栓服的尴尬经历，真嗣这次特别小心地确保拿对了。他脱下显然无用的那件，换上新的，心中纳闷这两者究竟有何不同。在真嗣看来，它们看起来一模一样，他心里耸了耸肩，随即返回了笼子。

"What happened to getting changed?" asked Asuka.
"换衣服的事呢？" 明日香问道。

"This is it, apparently," Shinji replied, gesturing at the 'new' plugsuit. "Doesn't seem any different to me."
看来这就是了，" 真嗣回答，指着那件'新'的插入栓服。"对我来说，似乎没什么不同。

"That's because it hasn't been activated yet," said Akagi, before grabbing Shinji's left arm and pressing a button on the suit's forearm that he hadn't noticed. She immediately took several steps backwards.
"那是因为还没激活，" 赤木说，随即抓住真嗣的左臂，按下了他未曾注意到的套装前臂上的一个按钮。她立刻后退了几步。

The plugsuit instantly ballooned out in a manner similar to how the Sixth Angel had looked moments before its death. Shinji's arms waggled futilely as he attempted to keep his balance as the evil scientist Akagi ducked out of his way.
插入栓服瞬间膨胀开来，与第六使徒死亡前一刻的模样颇为相似。真嗣的手臂无力地挥动着，试图保持平衡，而邪恶科学家赤木则躲开了他的路线。

And Asuka burst out laughing.
阿苏卡突然大笑起来。

"Oh my god!" she said between peals of laughter. "Thanks for taking that bullet for me, Shinji!"
天哪！" 她边笑边说，"谢谢你替我挡了这一下，真嗣！

"Asuka..." Shinji whined, before finally losing his balance and toppling forward, landing on what would be his stomach and rolling sideways. Only the rails on the gantry prevented him from taking a dip in the LCL pool surrounding Unit-02, although Shinji had a feeling he'd just float like a stupid-looking balloon if that happened.
"阿苏卡..." 真嗣哀怨地说，随后终于失去平衡，向前栽倒，落在地上滚向一侧。多亏了高架上的栏杆，他才没掉进环绕零号机二型的 LCL 池中，尽管真嗣觉得如果真掉进去，自己只会像个傻乎乎的气球一样漂浮。

The scene only amplified Asuka's laughter at his predicament. Even Doctor Akagi seemed amused at the sight, although she at least had the decency to help him out by grabbing his arm again and deactivating the suit, causing it to compress back to the point where he could get back to his feet.
这一幕让阿苏卡对他的窘境笑得更欢了。就连赤木博士似乎也被这场景逗乐了，不过她至少还有点分寸，伸手再次抓住他的胳膊，关闭了装甲服，使其压缩回原状，好让他能重新站起来。

"Oh geeze... I really needed that," Asuka sighed, giving off the occasional snort of amusement and not bothering at all to remove the smile from her face.
"哎呀...我真是太需要这个了," 明日香叹了口气，不时发出几声轻笑，脸上那抹微笑丝毫没有要收敛的意思。

"Now that you've had your fun, Asuka," said Akagi, "it's time to deploy. Get to Unit-01."
既然你已经玩够了，明日香," 赤木说道，"是时候出发了。去驾驶初号机。

"Sure." Asuka turned to leave, but glanced over her shoulder at Shinji. "Good luck Shinji. I'm sure you'll roll right over any resistance the Angel puts up."
好的。" 明日香转身欲走，却又回头瞥了一眼真嗣。"加油，真嗣。我相信你一定能轻松碾压使徒的任何抵抗。

"Asuka!" Shinji groaned. "明日香！" 真嗣无奈地叹息道。

"Fat chance of that Angel getting away from you!"
那小天使想从你手里逃脱？门儿都没有！

"Come on!" 快点！

"It'll be crushed by the sheer magnitude of your presence!"
它会被你那压倒性的存在感碾压得粉碎！

Shinji gave up, burying his face in his hands as Asuka left, cackling in a very Misato-like fashion.
真嗣放弃了，双手掩面，而明日香则以一种酷似美里的大笑方式离去。

XXX

Staring down into the volcano, Shinji took a nervous breath. Unit-02 was currently dangling directly over a sea of molten rock by a bunch of cables; not an ideal situation by any stretch of the word, but it seemed to be the only way to get an Evangelion down to the depths of the Angel egg.
俯视着火山口，真嗣紧张地吸了一口气。二号机此刻正被几根电缆悬挂在熔岩之海上，这绝非理想状况，但似乎是唯一能让 EVA 下到使徒卵深处的办法。

With his suit inflated, Shinji was barely able to reach the controls until he remembered what Asuka had done during the fight against the Sixth Angel. It took a moment of fumbling before he found the switch that extended the controls to a point he could comfortably reach.
由于防护服充气膨胀，真嗣几乎够不着控制台，直到他想起在与第六使徒战斗中明日香的做法。摸索了一会儿，他才找到那个能将控制杆延伸至舒适操作位置的开关。

Unit-01 was already on station, kneeling on the ground near the lip of the volcano with its gaze locked onto the dive suit. And in the sky above them, several aircraft were slowly circling, looking a lot like vultures waiting for a victim to expire. Shinji had wondered aloud if they were there to help NERV, only to receive the disturbing news that the planes were carrying N2 mines and were there in case of mission failure; their orders would be to bomb the entire area, regardless of human casualties.
初号机已经就位，跪在火山口边缘附近，目光紧锁着潜水服。而在他们头顶的天空中，几架飞机正缓缓盘旋，宛如等待猎物断气的秃鹫。真嗣曾大声质疑它们是否来支援 NERV，却得到了令人不安的消息：这些飞机携带着 N2 地雷，以防任务失败；它们的命令是轰炸整个区域，不顾人员伤亡。

And those orders had apparently come from his own father, according to the radio chatter.
根据无线电通讯，这些命令显然出自他自己的父亲之手。

"Beginning descent," came the report from the command centre. Shinji shook his head, willing himself back onto the task at hand. Even if he wanted to, there was likely no time for him to change his mind and switch roles. For all he knew the egg was going to hatch any minute.
"开始下降，"指挥中心传来报告。真嗣摇了摇头，强迫自己回到当前的任务上。即便他想改变主意，换角色，恐怕也没时间了。据他所知，那颗蛋随时都可能孵化。

"Watch yourself down there, Shinji," warned Asuka.
"小心点，真嗣，"明日香警告道。

Looking up as best as his suit could manage, Shinji barely saw Unit-01's head poking over the lip of the volcano. He took his right hand off the electromagnetic cage, something that seemed to just be a metal bar with two more at each end, and gave what he hoped was a cheery wave with the limited movement available to the dive suit as the suit's feet touched the magma. When the magma rose to the level of the suit's chest, he gave Unit-01 and Asuka a thumbs up by opening the pincer as far as he could, eliciting the strange reaction of an amused snort from his fellow pilot as he sank under the magma's surface.
尽管潜水服的视野有限，真嗣还是尽力抬头，勉强看到零号机的头部从火山口边缘探出。他松开右手握着的电磁笼——那似乎只是中间一根金属棒，两端各有两根——并尽力用潜水服有限的移动范围，向他们挥手示意，尽管这动作显得有些笨拙。当岩浆升至潜水服的胸部高度时，他尽力张开夹钳，做出一个竖起大拇指的动作，引得他的同伴飞行员发出一声好笑的哼声，随后他便沉入了岩浆表面之下。

"Really Shinji? Doing the Terminator thing at a time like this?"
真嗣，你认真的吗？这种时候还来终结者那一套？

Shinji blinked as he brought the suit's right arm back to the metal bar. "Um... what?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，将装甲服的右臂重新搭回金属杆上。“呃...什么？”

"...Never mind," Asuka sighed.
“...算了，”明日香叹了口气。

Another blink, and Shinji mentally shrugged as he gave up trying to understand what she meant; he had more important things to focus on. He was now fully submerged, and just starting to feel like he'd just gotten into a warm bath when the coolant system finally kicked in, to his great relief.
又眨了一下眼，真嗣在心里耸了耸肩，放弃了试图理解她意思的念头；他有更重要的事情要关注。此刻他已完全浸没，正当他开始感觉自己仿佛刚泡进温水中时，冷却系统终于启动了，这让他大大松了一口气。

"Current depth, one-seventy," reported Lieutenant Ibuki. "Current rate of descent, five metres per second."
“当前深度，一百七十米，”伊吹少尉报告道，“下降速度，每秒五米。”

Shinji looked around. All he could see was magma. "How am I supposed to see anything down here?" he wondered aloud.
真嗣环顾四周，映入眼帘的唯有熔岩。“在这种地方，我怎么可能看得见东西呢？”他不禁自言自语道。

"Activate the C.T. Monitor," said Doctor Akagi. "It will help somewhat, but there's not much we can do about seeing through molten rock."
“启动 C.T.监视器，”赤木博士说道，“虽然能有所帮助，但透过熔岩观察，我们能做的实在有限。”

"The what?" “什么监视器？”

There was a sigh. "One second, I'll do it for you."
传来一声叹息。“稍等，我来帮你操作。”

The view in front of Shinji changed. Now, instead of just red, he could also make out vague dark blobs passing by as Unit-02 gradually descended. He began to hear metal creaking as he reached the seven-hundred metre mark, then paled slightly at the next report from the command centre.
真嗣眼前的景象发生了变化。现在，除了红色，他还能隐约看到一些模糊的深色物体随着二号机逐渐下降而掠过。当他到达七百米标记时，开始听到金属的吱嘎声，随后在指挥中心的下一条报告传来时，脸色微微一白。

"We've reached the maximum safe depth."
我们已达到最大安全深度。

Shinji shook his head and exhaled. NERV would not have sent him down here to die before he could accomplish anything. He just had to trust in their competence.
真嗣摇了摇头，深吸一口气。NERV 不会在他完成任何任务之前就派他下来送死。他必须相信他们的能力。

"Thirteen hundred. We've reached the predicted target level."
一千三百米。我们已达到预期的目标深度。

After coming to a halt, Shinji took a long look around before giving the report he knew the people up top wouldn't like. "It doesn't look like anything's here."
停下脚步后，真嗣环顾四周良久，才报告了他知道上面的人不会喜欢的话：“这里似乎什么也没有。”

There was some muttering from the command centre, before Misato's voice cut through. "Go deeper. We'll continue this operation." The order drew more muttering of a discontent nature.
指挥中心传来一阵窃窃私语，随后是美里斩钉截铁的声音：“继续深入。我们将继续这次行动。”这道命令引发了更多不满的低语。

Before Shinji could say anything, Unit-02 lurched slightly as it continued descending. He decided to keep silent, but then he heard a cracking sound as he passed what the command centre considered the maximum allowed depth. "What was that?"
真嗣还未来得及开口，二号机便微微一晃，继续下潜。他决定保持沉默，但随即听到一声破裂声，此时他已超过了指挥中心规定的最大允许深度。“那是什么声音？”

"That was the second coolant pipe," came the stolid reply.
“那是第二冷却管破裂的声音。”对方平静地回答。

"Er... is that going to be a problem?" Shinji warily asked.
"呃...这会有问题吗？" 真嗣警惕地问道。

Misato's reply was terse. "Relax Shinji, it hasn't ruptured yet."
美里回答得很简短。"放松点，真嗣，它还没破裂。"

There was another crack, much louder than the first. "And that?"
又是一声裂响，比之前的要响得多。"那这个呢？"

"Unit-02 just lost its Progressive Knife."
二号机刚丢了它的高振动粒子刀。

"Are you sure about this, Misato?" Asuka suddenly piped up. "Things are already starting to break!"
你确定要这么做吗，美里？" 明日香突然插话道，"事情已经开始出问题了！

"I am in charge here," Misato replied tartly. "This operation will continue."
这里我说了算，" 美里尖锐地回应，"这次行动将继续进行。

That just seemed to set Asuka off. "Come on, Shinji's down there! Don't you care about him?!"
这话似乎激怒了明日香，"拜托，真嗣还在下面呢！你难道不关心他吗？！"

A couple people in the command centre also voiced their concerns over Shinji's safety, eliciting a warm feeling in his chest he couldn't put down to the magma.
指挥中心里也有几个人对真嗣的安全表示担忧，这让他胸中涌起一股暖流，难以归咎于岩浆的热度。

"...Shinji, do you want to abandon the op?" Misato finally asked, once people stopped shouting at her.
"...真嗣，你想放弃这次行动吗？" 终于，在人们停止对她大喊大叫后，葛城美里问道。

Shinji exhaled slowly. Asuka was clearly worried, but Misato seemed just as calm as ever. He made a decision. "We haven't found the Angel yet. If we back out now we might never find it before it attacks. Let's keep going."
真嗣缓缓地呼出一口气。明日香显然很担心，但葛城美里看起来一如既往地镇定。他做出了决定。"我们还没找到使徒。如果现在撤退，可能就再也找不到它了，它会在我们之前发动攻击。我们继续前进。"

"Well, you heard him," said Misato, a note of approval in her voice. "Keep going until we find the Angel."
嗯，你们都听到了，" 葛城美里说道，声音中带着一丝赞许。"继续前进，直到我们找到使徒。

The descent continued in silence for a short time, until Shinji heard a pinging sound.
短暂的沉默后，下降继续进行，直到真嗣听到了一阵叮叮声。

"Depth at seventeen-eighty," Ibuki reported. "We've reached the corrected target level."
深度十七点八，"伊吹报告道，"我们已经达到修正后的目标水平。

Unit-02 came to a halt once more, and Shinji peered through the murky gloom. "Nothing ye- ...wait..." A black oval seemed to slowly float into sight. "There! I see it!"
二号机再次停下，真嗣透过朦胧的昏暗向外窥视。"什么也没有...等等..."一个黑色的椭圆形似乎缓缓漂入视野。"那里！我看到了！"

Misato's voice was practically exultant. "Great! Get ready for capture!"
美里几乎欣喜若狂的声音传来，"太好了！准备捕捉！"

The electromagnetic cage shifted, the main bar extending outward in both directions as the cross bars unfolded and locked into place. Unit-02 began to drift towards the egg.
电磁笼开始移动，主杆向两侧延伸，横杆展开并锁定到位。二号机开始向那个卵状物漂移。

"Since both you and the target are being moved by the current, you'll only get one shot at catching it," said Doctor Akagi. "Make it count."
既然你和目标都在水流中移动，你只有一次捕捉的机会，"赤木博士说道，"要把握好。

Shinji leaned forward slightly in his seat. "Acknowledged."
真嗣在座位上微微前倾，"明白。"

Unit-02 and the egg slowly drew closer together until, with almost no fanfare, the cage activated and projected walls of light around the egg. Shinji stared at it for several seconds, expecting something to happen, before finally leaning back and sighing in relief. "Target secure."
二号机与那颗蛋缓缓靠近，直到几乎没有任何预兆，笼子启动了，四周投射出光墙围绕着蛋。真嗣凝视了几秒钟，期待着什么发生，最终才向后靠去，松了口气，"目标已安全。"

"Well done, Shinji!" said Misato, as the command centre buzzed in excitement.
"干得好，真嗣！" 美里说道，指挥中心随即洋溢着兴奋的气氛。

"Yeah, good job!" Asuka added. "But don't get complacent!"
嗯，干得好！"明日香补充道，"但别得意忘形！

Shinji wiped a hand across his brow as Unit-02 began to rise through the magma. Despite the liquid environment, he still felt like sweat was beading on his forehead. "Just in time it seems," he remarked. "Starting to feel like a sauna in here."
真嗣用手擦了擦额头，此时二号机正从岩浆中升起。尽管身处液态环境，他仍感觉额头上仿佛有汗珠凝结。"看来时机正好，"他评论道，"这里开始变得像桑拿房一样了。"

"Even the best coolant systems will only delay the inevitable when a volcano's involved," said Doctor Akagi. "Be glad you're on your way up now."
即使是最好的冷却系统，在火山面前也只能延缓不可避免的命运，"赤木博士说道，"庆幸你现在正在上升吧。

"Yeah..." Shinji glanced at his new cargo, ensconced within the electromagnetic cage. He blinked several times, then rubbed his eyes. Something seemed... different. "Hey, is the-"
是啊……"真嗣瞥了一眼新运载的货物，它被电磁笼牢牢包裹。他眨了几下眼，然后揉了揉眼睛。似乎有什么……不一样了。"嘿，是不是——

People began shouting in the command centre, but a much closer and more immediately pressing matter demanded Shinji's attention. There were strange noises coming from inside the cage, and the egg itself was starting to bulge.
指挥中心内人们开始大声呼喊，但真嗣眼前有一个更近且更紧迫的问题需要关注。笼子里传来奇怪的声响，而那颗蛋也开始鼓胀起来。

"Jettison the cage!" 抛掉笼子！

Shinji immediately did as ordered. The metal bar his suit was holding broke off, leaving a small stub in his pincers, and the cage began to float freely in the lava as he continued upwards. He dropped the useless bar and made to go for his Progressive Knife before he remembered a crucial detail.
真嗣立刻遵命行事。他机甲握着的金属杆断裂，只留下一小截在夹钳中，笼子随即在熔岩中自由漂浮，而他则继续向上攀升。他丢弃了无用的杆子，正要伸手去拿他的前进式匕首，却突然记起一个关键细节。

"Damn, no knife! Asuka, can you send me yours?"
该死，没带刀！明日香，能把你的传给我吗？

"Already on its way, Shinji!"
已经上路了，真嗣！

In front of him, the Angel finally burst out of its egg. Fully formed within seconds, just as Doctor Akagi predicted, it looked similar to a large stingray sporting two arms with tentacle-like fingers. A flick of its tail sent it swimming rapidly out of Shinji's sight, leaving him to growl in frustration. He raised a hand, ready to catch the knife making its hideously slow descent towards him.
在他面前，使徒终于破壳而出。正如赤木博士所预料，它几秒钟内完全成形，模样酷似一只巨大的鳐鱼，长着两条带有触手般手指的手臂。它尾巴一甩，便迅速游出了真嗣的视线，留下他懊恼地低吼。他举起手，准备接住那把正缓慢向他落下的刀。

"How long on that knife?!" he shouted.
"那把刀还要多久？！" 他喊道。

"Twenty seconds!" Ibuki quickly replied.
"二十秒！" 伊吹迅速回答。

Doctor Akagi had more urgent news. "He doesn't have twenty seconds!"
赤木医生带来了更紧急的消息。"他连二十秒都没有了！"

The Angel made a sudden reappearance directly in front of Shinji, opening its fanged maw as it charged at Unit-02. The two massive bodies collided heavily, and the Angel's mouth latched onto the dive suit's helmet as one of its hands curled around the suit's left leg.
天使突然再次出现在真嗣面前，张开它那长满尖牙的大口，向二号机冲去。两个庞大的身躯猛烈相撞，天使的嘴紧紧咬住潜水服的头盔，一只手则缠绕在潜水服的左腿上。

"How the hell can it open its mouth in magma?!" somebody shouted in Shinji's ear.
"这玩意儿怎么可能在岩浆里张嘴?!" 有人对着真嗣的耳朵大喊。

Finally, the knife landed in Unit-02's raised pincer. Shinji immediately activated the blade and, with a wordless yell, stabbed it down into what looked like one of the Angel's eyes... only for it to simply bounce off. He felt a sudden heat and pressure on his left leg as the dive suit's own leg cracked in the Angel's hand. Seconds later, that became a jolt of agony as the leg was jettisoned, and he fought the urge to take his hands off the controls to ensure his leg was still fine.
最终，刀刃落在了二号机举起的钳子上。真嗣立刻启动刀片，无声地大喊一声，将刀刺向看似天使眼睛的部位... 结果只是弹开了。他突然感到左腿一阵热压，潜水服的腿在天使手中裂开。几秒钟后，随着腿部被弹射出去，剧痛袭来，他强忍着不去松开控制器，以确认自己的腿是否安然无恙。

"The molecular structure of the Angel has evolved to survive in magma!" said Akagi. "The Prog Knife is useless!"
天使的分子结构已经进化到能在岩浆中生存了！"赤木说道，"相位刀根本没用！

"Would have been nice if you'd thought of that beforehand!" Asuka angrily deadpanned.
"你要是早点想到就好了！"明日香没好气地讽刺道。

After a couple more futile stabs, Shinji glanced at the arm that was holding the knife, and noticed the coolant tube attached to it.
又尝试了几次徒劳的刺击后，真嗣瞥了一眼握着刀的手臂，注意到了附在上面的冷却管。

"Thermal expansion!" he said as realisation dawned. With the knife in his suit's right pincer, he brought it around to his left arm and sliced through the tube just past its mounting point on the forearm. The view immediately began to darken in that area as coolant streamed out into the magma.
"热胀冷缩！"他恍然大悟地说道。将刀握在装甲服的右钳中，他将其移至左臂，在接近前臂安装点的地方切断了管道。视野立即在那片区域开始变暗，冷却液涌出，流入岩浆之中。

"Oh you brilliant boy!" Asuka cheered as she cottoned on to his plan.
"哦，你这聪明的小子！" 明日香恍然大悟地欢呼起来，明白了他的计划。

Shinji jammed his left arm in between the Angel's mouth and the suit's helmet, sending the coolant flooding into the Angel's internals.
真嗣将左臂猛地插入使徒的嘴与装甲头盔之间，让冷却液涌入使徒体内。

"I see now!" Akagi remarked. "Redirect all coolant to pipe three!"
现在我明白了！" 赤木说道，"将所有冷却液转向三号管道！

The Angel predictably reacted violently, grabbing onto Unit-02 with both arms thrashing about as it attempted to crush its prey's head. Shinji felt himself being yanked back and forth, and manipulated the left pincer to try to grab onto anything it could in the Angel's mouth. With his right hand, he stabbed the knife down once again, and it finally managed to bite into his target's skin.
使徒果然激烈反应，双臂紧紧抓住二号机，疯狂挥舞试图压碎猎物的头部。真嗣感到自己被来回拉扯，便操纵左钳试图在使徒口中抓住任何能抓的东西。同时，他用右手再次猛刺刀刃，终于成功穿透了目标的皮肤。

Now the Angel seemed to be panicking. Its mouth released its grip on Unit-02's head as it tried to turn its body around to escape, but Shinji had managed to clamp onto something in its mouth and the Angel ended up trying to drag him with it in a manner similar to the Sixth Angel. Its efforts were cut short by the tether Unit-02 was attached to, but it kept trying to yank itself free, pulling the Evangelion around.
此刻，天使似乎陷入了恐慌。它松开了咬住二号机头部的嘴，试图转身逃脱，但真嗣已紧紧抓住了它口中的某物，使得天使如同第六使徒般试图拖着他一起逃走。然而，二号机所系的缆绳阻止了它的企图，但它仍不断挣扎，试图挣脱，拖拽着福音战士四处移动。

Somebody in the command centre voiced a concern, but Shinji was entirely focused on destroying this thing before it could escape. Finally, and with almost no fanfare, the knife cut through the Angel's skin and the beast's thrashing stopped as its body began to disintegrate in the magma.
指挥中心有人表达了担忧，但真嗣全神贯注于摧毁这个生物，以防其逃脱。最终，几乎没有任何声响，刀刃划破了天使的皮肤，随着其身体开始在岩浆中瓦解，那野兽的挣扎也停止了。

Shinji let out a sigh of relief as the last traces of the Angel vanished. He barely noticed that his knife had disappeared as well, but he didn't need it anymore. Shifting on his seat, Shinji watched the magma as Unit-02...
随着天使的最后痕迹消失，真嗣长舒了一口气。他几乎未曾察觉自己的刀也已不见，但已不再需要它。真嗣在座位上调整了一下姿势，注视着岩浆，而二号机……

Stayed right where it was.
依旧稳稳地停留在原地。

"Um... why have you stopped pulling me up?" he asked of the command centre.
"呃...为什么你们停止拉我上来了？"他向指挥中心问道。

"The crane took some damage from when that thing was pulling you around like a hooked fish," Akagi replied. "It wasn't designed to bend like a fishing rod. We're taking a moment to check it over before we resume your ascent."
起重机在那个东西像钓钩上的鱼一样拖着你时受损了，"赤木回答道，"它不是设计来像钓鱼竿那样弯曲的。我们正在检查一下，确保安全后再继续你的上升。

"Oh... well, be quick please." Shinji leaned forward and glanced out at the magma, specifically at his suit's left arm. "I think we're going to run out of coolant soon."
哦...那请快点。"真嗣向前倾身，望向岩浆，特别是他的装甲左臂。"我觉得我们很快就要用完冷却剂了。

"Coolant? No, we... oh shit!"
冷却剂？不，我们...哦，糟糕！

The torrent of coolant from the broken pipe slowed and then stopped, but Shinji was already starting to feel the heat. "Really, please be quick," he repeated, trying to hide his frustration at their inattentiveness.
从破裂管道中涌出的冷却液渐渐减缓并最终停止，但真嗣已经开始感受到热度。“真的，请快点。”他重复道，试图掩饰对他们疏忽的沮丧。

"Okay, we're resuming." The message came at the exact same time Shinji felt the ascent begin. He leaned back and closed his eyes, glad that the worst was over.
“好的，我们继续上升。”消息传来的同时，真嗣感觉到上升开始。他向后靠去，闭上眼睛，庆幸最糟糕的时刻已经过去。

And then, just as he heard a shout of alarm, his stomach did a flip as he felt himself plummet down towards the Earth's core.
就在他听到一声惊呼的瞬间，他的胃一阵翻腾，感觉到自己正急速坠向地心。

### Chapter 20 Apologise To Him!

The first sign Asuka saw of something going wrong was when the crane's boom suddenly shifted while Shinji was still grappling with the Angel. She couldn't see what was going on down there, but it couldn't be good if the crane was now bending like it was. Fortunately, nothing seemed to actually break, but she kept an eye on the boom anyway.
明日香察觉到异常的第一个迹象，是起重机的吊臂在真嗣与使徒搏斗时突然移动。她看不见下面的具体情况，但吊臂像那样弯曲肯定不是好事。幸运的是，似乎并没有真的断裂，但她还是紧盯着吊臂不放。

When word came that the Angel was dead, Asuka refused to let herself relax. Shinji was still down there, so the mission was not yet complete. Only when both of them were out of their Evangelions would she consider everything wrapped up.
当消息传来使徒已被消灭时，明日香拒绝让自己放松。真嗣还在下面，所以任务尚未完成。只有当他们两人都离开各自的福音战士后，她才会认为一切尘埃落定。

The second sign was when, somehow, the idiots in the command centre forgot to redirect the dive suit's coolant away from the broken pipe after the Angel's death, until Shinji mentioned it. It didn't matter that they had been fussing over the crane; somebody should have remembered.
第二个迹象是，不知怎么的，指挥中心的那帮蠢货在使徒死后忘记将潜水服的冷却剂从破损的管道中转移，直到真嗣提起。他们忙于处理起重机的事故无关紧要，总该有人记得这一点。

Since she was now outright expecting something to go wrong, Asuka shifted position so that she was standing right underneath the boom. If it ended up snapping, she could at least try and keep it in place until Shinji made it back to dry land.
既然她现在完全预料到会有什么差错，明日香调整位置，直接站在吊臂下方。如果吊臂真的断裂，她至少可以尝试保持其稳定，直到真嗣返回陆地。

Asuka had been practically waiting for the shriek of tortured metal that soon followed, but what she wasn't expecting was for the hoist to suddenly reverse direction, sending Unit-02 hurtling downwards. Quicker than even she thought possible, Unit-01's hands latched onto the cable and pulled tight.
明日香几乎是在等待那随之而来的金属撕裂声，但她没料到的是，吊索会突然改变方向，使二号机猛地向下坠落。比她想象的还要快，初号机的双手紧紧抓住了缆绳，用力一拉。

The sheer force almost ripped the cable out of the purple Evangelion's hands; Asuka had to dig her feet in as she was dragged towards the edge of the volcano. She knew that she wouldn't even need to reach the edge before she'd fall in, as there wasn't much support around the lip. Just the weight of her own Evangelion would break the ground and send her falling after Shinji.
巨大的拉力几乎要将缆绳从紫色使徒的手中扯出；明日香不得不稳住脚步，被拖向火山边缘。她清楚，自己甚至无需触碰到边缘就会坠落，因为火山口边缘几乎没有支撑。仅仅是她自己使徒的重量就足以破坏地面，让她步上真嗣的后尘。

To her great relief, Unit-01 and the cable came to a stop well short of the precarious edge. Asuka hauled back on the cable, slowly stepping away from the volcano's rim as she struggled to support the weight of several thousand tons in just one Evangelion's hands.
令她大为宽慰的是，初号机和缆绳在离危险边缘还有一段距离时停了下来。明日香用力拉回缆绳，一边艰难地支撑着数千吨的重量，一边缓慢地从火山口边缘退开。

"What are you waiting for?!" she growled at the command centre. "Reel him back in!"
“你们还在等什么？！”她对着指挥中心咆哮道，“快把他拉回来！”

"We can't, the reel's not reacting!" Doctor Akagi shouted back. "You're the only thing stopping Shinji and Unit-02 from falling!"
我们做不到，卷轴没有反应！"赤木博士大声回应。"你是唯一阻止真嗣和二号机坠落的因素！

"Oh, lovely," Asuka grimly retorted, taking another step back. "Don't suppose you could get Wondergirl out here in the next minute or so to lend a hand?"
哦，真棒，"明日香冷冷地反驳，又后退了一步。"不知道你能不能让奇迹女孩在一分钟内出来帮忙？

"Afraid not. She would either get here too late or be out of power before she did."
恐怕不行。她要么来得太晚，要么在到达之前就没电了。

Finally at what she considered a safe distance, Asuka began pulling on the cable hand-over-hand, taking the place of the broken piece of junk that was supposed to be getting Shinji out of danger. It was torturously slow going, and already she could feel the muscles of Unit-01 straining under the weight.
最终，在自认为安全的距离，明日香开始手拉手地拽动电缆，取代了那本应将真嗣从危险中救出的破烂设备。进展缓慢得令人痛苦，她已经能感觉到初号机肌肉在重压下的紧绷。

"Asuka...?" Shinji spoke up, his comm window flashing to life out of the corner of her eye. "You... caught me?"
明日香...？" 真嗣开口了，他的通讯窗口在她眼角闪烁着亮起。"你... 救了我？

"Damn right I did," Asuka grunted. "Just sit tight, I'll get you out of there."
当然是我。" 明日香哼了一声。"别动，我这就把你弄出来。

"Okay... please hurry..."
好的... 请快点...

Asuka could hear the weakness in Shinji's voice. The heat was clearly starting to get to him, and she mentally cursed the NERV staff for forgetting about his coolant.
明日香能听出真嗣声音中的虚弱。显然，高温已经开始影响他了，她在心里咒骂着 NERV 的工作人员，竟然忘了给他补充冷却剂。

Hand forward, grab, pull. The seconds stretched out as Asuka focused entirely on Unit-01's arms, Shinji's heavy breathing rasping in her ears.
手伸出，抓住，拉回。时间仿佛被拉长，明日香全神贯注于零号机的双臂，耳边是真嗣沉重的呼吸声。

Hand forward, grab, pull. Even if she could spare the time and effort, she didn't want to shut the comm system off. To silence Shinji. As distracting as it was, it was a sign that he was still alive down there.
手伸出，抓住，拉回。即便她有时间和精力，也不愿关闭通讯系统。不想让真嗣的声音消失。尽管这很分散注意力，但这是他还活着的证明。

Hand forward, grab, pull. "How much further?!" she demanded of the command centre.
手伸出，抓住，拉回。“还有多远？！”她向指挥中心质问道。

"You're at six hundred met-" The crunch of metal cut Misato off. "Shit! The dive suit's starting to give out!"
“你已经到了六百米——”金属碎裂的声音打断了美里的话。“该死！潜水服开始撑不住了！”

Somehow, Asuka found it within herself to push Unit-01 faster. The cable piled up in a heap at the Evangelion's feet as its hands went faster and faster. She felt some of the strain disappear from her arms; whether it was her second wind or something else, she didn't care. All that mattered was rescuing Shinji.
不知怎的，明日香发现自己能让零号机跑得更快。电缆在福音战士脚下堆积成堆，它的双手越来越快地挥动。她感到手臂上的压力有所减轻；无论是第二股劲还是别的什么，她都不在乎。重要的是救出真嗣。

"Four hundred metres!" 四百米！

Grab, pull, grab, pull, grab, pull.
抓取，拉扯，抓取，拉扯，抓取，拉扯。

"Three hundred!" 三百米！

The strain returned to Asuka's arms, but she powered through it.
明日香的胳膊再次感到酸痛，但她咬牙坚持着。

"Two hundred!" 两百！

A low growl began at the back of Asuka's throat. She spared half a second to glance at Shinji's comm window to see that his head was slumped sideways and his eyes were closed. The LCL around him was starting to bubble. Just like it had when she had almost been boiled alive by Ramiel's attack.
明日香的喉咙深处开始发出低沉的咆哮。她分出半秒钟瞥了一眼真嗣的通讯窗口，只见他的头歪向一边，双眼紧闭，周围的 LCL 开始冒泡。就像她差点被雷天使的攻击活活煮沸时那样。

"One hundred!" 一百！

The growl became a wordless yell as the white shell of the dive suit came into Asuka's vision. Once it was high enough to clear the lip of the volcano, she finally stopped pulling on the cable and wrapped it several times around Unit-01's right arm. The crane began to rotate to bring Unit-02 over dry land, but it was going far too slow. A purple hand grabbed onto the frame of the crane and forcefully assisted its rotation.
随着白色潜水服的身影映入眼帘，咆哮声化作了无言的呐喊。当它升至足以越过火山口边缘的高度时，明日香终于停止了拉拽缆绳，将其在初号机的右臂上缠绕了数圈。起重机开始旋转，试图将二号机移至干地上方，但速度实在太慢。一只紫色的手猛地抓住起重机框架，强行加速了其旋转。

Asuka heard something else break, but it didn't matter now. She unwrapped the cable, letting Unit-02 drop to the ground. Unit-01 bounded over to its stricken comrade, where the back of the dive suit was violently ripped off. The moment it was clear, Unit-02's entry plug ejection sequence activated. Asuka yanked the tube free and set it on the ground as it vented steaming LCL everywhere.
明日香又听到什么东西断裂的声音，但现在已无关紧要。她解开缆绳，任由二号机坠落地面。初号机一跃而至受伤的同伴身边，猛力撕开了潜水服的后背。一旦露出空隙，二号机的插入栓弹射程序随即启动。明日香迅速拔出连接管，将其置于地面，任由喷涌而出的 LCL 蒸汽四溢。

Remembering how long it had taken to force Rei's entry plug open after it had suffered heat warping, Asuka pulled out Unit-01's second Progressive knife and thumbed the activation switch, before bringing it down on the back end of Shinji's entry plug. Designed for much thicker targets, the knife barely even noticed the thin metal before digging into the ground. She then turned the knife off and set it aside before laying Unit-01 on the ground and activating her own ejection sequence.
回想起当初因高温变形而费尽周折才打开绫波的插入栓，明日香从零号机上抽出第二把近战刀，按下启动开关，随即向真嗣的插入栓尾部砍去。这把刀设计用于更厚实的目标，面对薄弱的金属几乎未受阻碍，便深深插入地面。她随即关闭刀具，将其搁置一旁，然后让零号机平躺，启动了自己的弹出程序。

Jumping down from the Evangelion, Asuka tucked and rolled as she hit the ground. Breaking a leg would only make rescuing Shinji harder, but she was in too much of a hurry to take the descent more carefully. She sprinted over to his entry plug and clambered in, ignoring the hot metal that was trying to melt her plugsuit to her feet. Shinji was unconscious, almost falling out of his seat as Asuka reached him. She jammed a finger on the switch that deactivated the inflated suit and picked him up in a fireman's carry before exiting the plug, his plugsuit painfully hot to the touch.
从使徒身上跃下，明日香着地时顺势翻滚。摔断腿只会让营救真嗣更加困难，但此刻她心急如焚，无暇顾及更谨慎的降落方式。她疾奔至他的插入栓前，不顾烫得几乎要将她的战斗服与脚部熔合的金属，迅速爬入其中。真嗣已陷入昏迷，几乎要从座椅上滑落，明日香赶到时，他已近似无意识。她猛地按下解除充气服的开关，将他以消防员背负方式扛起，随即离开插入栓，触碰到的战斗服热得令人痛苦。

Laying him out on the ground well away from the steaming LCL and hot metal tube, Asuka pressed the button on Shinji's wrist that would re-pressurise the suit and pulled it down to his stomach to get some cool air onto his body. She placed an ear on the reddened skin of his chest -trying to ignore the close physical contact- and breathed a sigh of relief when she heard a steady heartbeat and felt his chest rise and fall.
将他平放在远离蒸腾的 LCL 和滚烫金属管的地面上，明日香按下真嗣手腕上的按钮，重新给装甲加压，并将其拉至他的腹部，以便让凉风吹拂他的身体。她将耳朵贴在他泛红的胸膛上——尽量不去在意这亲密的接触——当听到他平稳的心跳和感受到胸膛的起伏时，她松了一口气。

"Ngh..." 嗯……

And then Shinji groaned into wakefulness.
随后，真嗣发出一声呻吟，逐渐苏醒过来。

Asuka rapidly brought her head up, focusing on his bright red face as Shinji scrunched his eyes up before slowly opening them.
明日香迅速抬起头，目光聚焦在真嗣通红的脸上，只见他皱起眉头，然后缓缓睁开眼睛。

"Unfamiliar... sky?" he softly murmured.
"陌生的...天空吗？"他轻声低语。

"Shinji!" Asuka almost shouted. "How... how are you feeling?"
真嗣！"明日香几乎喊了出来。"你...你感觉怎么样？

Blinking rapidly, Shinji raised his head slightly to look at her. "...Asuka?"
真嗣快速眨着眼，微微抬头望向她。"...明日香？"

"Of course it's me. Who were you expecting, Pen-pen?"
当然是我。你以为是谁，企鹅便便？

Instead of an answer, Shinji stared at her for several seconds with his mouth opening and closing like a goldfish. Then quicker than Asuka expected for someone who had just woken up after a near-death experience, he wrapped his arms around her in an awkward hug. "...Thank you," he mumbled into her shoulder.
没有回答，真嗣只是盯着她，嘴巴一张一合，像条金鱼。然后，出乎明日香意料，这个刚从鬼门关回来的人迅速地用笨拙的拥抱环绕住她。“...谢谢你，”他喃喃地对着她的肩膀说道。

"I-I w-wasn't just gonna leave you down there!" Asuka stammered, blushing furiously. Her arms were wavering about to both sides, as if she couldn't decide whether to return the hug or not. Eventually, she decided on simply resting her hands on his shoulders. "Bloody hell, you're hot," she remarked, as the excessive heat from Shinji's body began leeching through her plugsuit.
“我、我怎么可能就那样把你丢在下面不管！”明日香结结巴巴地说，满脸通红。她的双臂在两侧摇摆不定，似乎在犹豫是否要回抱。最终，她选择只是将手轻轻搭在他的肩上。“见鬼，你身上真烫，”她评论道，因为真嗣身体过度的热量开始透过她的插入栓服传递过来。

An amused snort from nearby drew Asuka's attention to where Misato and Doctor Akagi were standing, along with several emergency crew members. She blinked at them, before trying to leap away from Shinji in embarrassment as she realised what she had just inadvertently said.
附近传来一声轻笑，吸引了明日香的注意，她看到美里和赤木博士以及几位紧急救援人员正站在那里。她眨了眨眼，随即意识到自己刚才无意中说了什么，尴尬地试图从真嗣身边跳开。

"T-that's not what I meant and you damn well know it, Misato!" Asuka yelled as the woman in question began laughing.
“我说的不是那个意思，你明明知道，美里！”明日香喊道，而那位女士已经开始笑了起来。

After getting checked out by the medics, having to endure a funny-smelling cream being slathered over his body and then laying on a bed in a tiny room to rest while the cream soaked into his skin, Shinji was rather glad when Misato burst through the door with Asuka in tow.
在接受了医疗人员的检查后，忍受着涂满全身的怪味药膏，然后躺在一个小房间的床上休息，让药膏渗入皮肤，当美里带着明日香破门而入时，真嗣感到相当庆幸。

"Got some good news for you, Shinji!" she remarked, a big grin on her face that sent warning signals through Shinji's head as he sat up. He noticed that Asuka had changed back into her normal clothes just like him; courtesy of someone at NERV bringing out their stuff from the NERV pool's changing room.
"真嗣，有好消息告诉你！" 她笑着说，脸上的灿烂笑容让真嗣坐起身来时心头一紧。他注意到明日香也像他一样换回了平时的衣服；这得感谢 NERV 的某人从 NERV 泳池的更衣室里取出了他们的物品。

Seemingly recognising his trepidation, Asuka stepped forward. "Relax, this is actually good news."
似乎察觉到了他的不安，明日香走上前来说道："放心，这确实是好消息。"

Misato gave the interrupting redhead a cool look before continuing. "As a reward for your hard work today-" A snort from Asuka cut her off for a second. "-I found us a nearby hot spring resort and booked it out just for us!"
美里对插话的红发少女投去一个冷静的眼神，然后继续说："作为你们今天努力工作的奖励——" 明日香的一声嗤笑让她停顿了一下。"——我找到了附近的一个温泉度假村，并且为我们包场了！"

"A... hot spring?" Shinji struggled to keep concern off his face. After what he had just been through, he was barely able to consider even taking a shower when they got home unless the water was a step above freezing temperature.
"一...一个温泉？" 真嗣努力不让担忧显露在脸上。经历了刚才的一切，他几乎无法想象回家后能洗个澡，除非水温比冰点还要低。

"Yep, it'll be a nice way for us to unwind after all the stress NERV's been putting us through."
对，这会是我们放松的好方式，毕竟 NERV 给我们带来的压力太大了。

Asuka broke away from Misato, moving to stand by Shinji. She folded her arms and glared at their guardian. "After what you put us through, you mean. Shinji in particular," she hotly retorted.
明日香从美里身边走开，站到真嗣旁边，双臂交叉，瞪着他们的监护人。"我是说，经历了你让我们经历的那些事。尤其是真嗣，" 她激烈地反驳道。

Misato faltered, the smile on her face looking to make a hasty getaway. She sighed, closing her eyes and putting a hand on her forehead. "We can talk about that later. I just want to get out of here, and I'm sure you two do as well. We'll talk about my actions later. Please?"
美里有些动摇，脸上的笑容似乎急于逃离。她叹了口气，闭上眼睛，用手捂住额头。"我们可以稍后再谈那个。我只是想离开这里，我相信你们俩也是。关于我的行为，我们稍后再谈。好吗？"

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji saw Asuka glance at him for a moment before sighing and dropping her arms to her side. "Alright," she grunted, before pointing a finger at Misato. "But I'm not putting it off until we get home. We're going to 'talk about your actions' at the hot springs."
眼角余光中，真嗣瞥见明日香瞟了他一眼，随后叹了口气，双臂垂落身侧。“好吧，”她嘟囔着，然后指向美里，“但我不会等到回家再说。我们要在温泉里‘谈谈你的行为’。”

Misato sighed and waved her hand in vague agreement, "Yes, fine, let's just go."
美里叹了口气，挥手含糊地表示同意，“行，走吧。”

Getting to his feet, followed the other two outside and over to Misato's car. Asuka let him take the front passenger seat, claiming he'd earned it, before pushing the seat forward so that she could reach the back seat. After buckling her seatbelt, she leaned forward to rest her elbows on the front seats as Shinji and Misato got in.
真嗣站起身，跟随另外两人来到美里的车旁。明日香让他坐进副驾驶，声称这是他应得的，随后将座椅前推以便自己能进入后座。系好安全带后，她倾身向前，手肘撑在前排座椅上，与此同时，真嗣和美里也上了车。

Misato had not been exaggerating when she had said the resort was nearby. Ignoring the minute or so it took to leave the research site, it only took ten minutes of uncomfortably silent driving to reach the village and the resort. Despite the close proximity to the volcano, and relative proximity to Tokyo-3, the tiny village seemed entirely isolated from the rest of Japan. To Shinji, it felt more quiet and peaceful than even Fujikawa.
美里说度假村就在附近并非夸大其词。忽略掉离开研究场所的那一两分钟，仅用了十分钟令人不适的沉默驾驶，他们便抵达了那个村庄和度假村。尽管紧邻火山，且相对靠近第三新东京市，这个小村庄却仿佛与日本其他地方完全隔绝。在真嗣看来，这里比富士川还要宁静祥和。

As soon as the car came to a stop, its occupants got out and headed towards the resort. Misato and Asuka went straight in, but Shinji's attention was caught by a delivery van pulling up right next to Misato's car. A uniformed man got out, looking directly at him and waving, before opening the van's side door and rummaging around a bit before heading towards him carrying a box.
车子刚一停稳，乘客们便纷纷下车，朝度假村走去。明日香和真嗣径直进去了，但真嗣的注意力却被一辆恰好停在明日香车旁的送货车吸引。一个身穿制服的男子下了车，直视着真嗣并挥了挥手，随后打开货车侧门，翻找了一番，便抱着一个箱子朝他走来。

"Are you from NERV?" the man asked as he drew closer.
那人走近后问道：“你是来自 NERV 的吗？”

Shinji blinked. "Um... yes? Is this for Misato? I'll just go get-"
真嗣眨了眨眼，“呃……是的？这是给明日香的吗？我这就去叫——”

"It's fine, I just need a signature," the man interrupted, placing the box at Shinji's feet before holding out a small tablet. Shinji stared at it for a moment before taking it and signing his name with the attached stylus. The man thanked him and left as quickly as he came.
“没事，我只需要一个签名，”那人打断道，将箱子放在真嗣脚边，随即递出一个带有签名栏的小平板。真嗣愣了一下，接过平板，用附带的触控笔签上了自己的名字。那人道了声谢，便匆匆离去。

'Who the heck would know we're here?' Shinji thought to himself as he removed the tape holding the box closed. 'And get a delivery out to u-'
'到底谁会知道我们在这里？' 真嗣心里想着，同时撕掉了封住箱子的胶带。'而且还能送货到这里——'

Something burst out of the box, causing Shinji to let out a cry of surprise and fall back on his rear end. Then he realised just what that something was. Or rather, who.
箱子里突然有什么东西蹦了出来，吓得真嗣惊叫一声，一屁股坐倒在地。随后他才意识到那是什么，或者更确切地说，是谁。

"WARK!" 呱！

"Pen-pen?!" 企鹅波？!

After the day he'd just had, Shinji decided he didn't want to know how Misato's genetically-engineered warm water penguin had managed to find a way to smuggle himself out to join them at a hot spring resort. He raised his hands in surrender and said, "Have fun," before turning around and heading up the stairs to finally enter the resort.
经历了那样的一天后，真嗣决定不去探究美里那只基因工程制造的温水企鹅是如何设法偷偷溜出来，与他们一同来到温泉度假村的。他举手投降，说了句“玩得开心”，便转身走上楼梯，终于踏入了度假村。

XXX

Asuka gave a groan of contentment as she closed her eyes and leaned against the smoothed rocks bordering the hot spring. Despite the fact that it was essentially just hot water, something about it felt much more relaxing than taking a bath. Perhaps it was the open-air nature of the hot spring, or the isolation of the resort. Maybe it was the fact that Misato had booked out the entire resort just for the three of them. Well... three and a half counting Pen-pen, who had wandered over to the male side with Shinji.
明日香闭上眼睛，倚靠在温泉边打磨光滑的岩石上，发出满足的呻吟。尽管这本质上只是热水，但不知为何，它比泡澡要放松得多。或许是露天温泉的特性，或是度假村的幽静。也可能是美里为了他们三人——好吧，算上企鹅 Pen-pen 就是三个半——包下了整个度假村的缘故。Pen-pen 已经溜达到男性区那边，和真嗣一起了。

Whatever it was, she was in heaven.
无论原因是什么，她此刻感觉如临天堂。

Right up until Misato quietly cleared her throat.
直到美里轻轻地清了清嗓子。

Cracking one eye open, Asuka gave Misato, who was sitting on the rocks with her legs dangling in the water, a look cold enough to freeze Mount Asama.
浅浅睁开一只眼，明日香冷冷地瞥向坐在岩石上、双腿浸在水中的美里，那目光冷冽得仿佛能冻结浅间山。

"No sense putting it off any longer," Misato quietly remarked, her eyes flicking to the divider between the male and female sides of the spring.
"再拖下去也没意义了，"美里轻声说道，目光扫过温泉男女区之间的隔板。

Asuka held the stare for a long moment. Her open eye briefly trailed down Misato's body, noticing the large discolouration of a scar between her breasts and stomach, before she closed it and said, "How much did you actually think about Shinji during the operation, when you weren't talking to him?"
明日香凝视良久，睁开的那只眼短暂地顺着美里的身体下滑，注意到她胸腹间那块显眼的疤痕，随后闭上眼，问道："在手术中，当你没和真嗣说话时，你究竟有多少时间在想他？"

"...Hardly at all. I was more concerned with the Angel itself," came the meek response. Misato's voice hardened slightly as she continued. "I saw an opportunity to go on the offensive and I took it. The more we know about the Angels, the better we can kill them, the better the chance that humanity will survive. The goal of NERV is to defeat the Angels. Sometimes sacrifices may have to be made. You may not like it, Asuka, but that's the way it is."
...几乎没怎么想。我更关心的是使徒本身，"美里怯懦地回答，声音稍显坚定地继续道，"我看到了进攻的机会，便抓住了它。我们对使徒了解得越多，就越能有效地消灭它们，人类生存的机会也就越大。NERV 的目标就是击败使徒。有时可能不得不做出牺牲。你可能不喜欢这样，明日香，但事实就是如此。

Opening her eyes, Asuka fixed them squarely on Misato. "And if you have to throw your humanity away in the process?"
睁开眼睛，明日香直视着美里。“那如果在这个过程中你必须抛弃自己的人性呢？”

"Shinji understood the risks. He knew he was going into a volcano to capture an Angel. I'm told that he insisted he go instead of you."
“真嗣明白风险。他知道自己是要进入火山去捕捉使徒。我听说他坚持自己去，而不是你。”

"That's not the point!" Asuka slapped a hand down into the water. She glanced towards the male side of the hot spring before lowering her voice again. "The only reason you even remembered he was down there was because everyone else kicked up a fuss about you putting him in so much danger, sending him below the maximum safe limit without even discussing it. You became so focused on the job you forgot about the person actually doing that job."
“这不是重点！”明日香一掌拍进水中。她瞥了一眼男汤那边，然后再次压低声音。“你之所以还记得他在下面，只是因为其他人对你把他置于如此危险境地大发雷霆，未经讨论就将他送到了最大安全限度以下。你工作太投入，以至于忘记了真正在做那份工作的人。”

Misato exhaled heavily. "I know. And I apologise for that."
美里沉重地叹了口气。“我知道。对此我道歉。”

"Don't apologise to me, apologise to him!"
别跟我道歉，跟他道歉去！

Folding her arms, Misato glared at her. "I will. Later. But I will not apologise for our successful mission."
碇真嗣双手交叉，瞪着她。"我会道歉的，但不是现在。不过，我不会为我们成功的任务道歉。"

Asuka looked away with a huff.
明日香哼了一声，把头扭向一边。

Silence reigned for a few minutes, broken only by the contented splashing and squawking of Pen-pen on the other side of the wall. Asuka was curious about how he had managed to join them, but then remembered that the bird seemed to have a human-level intellect; she wondered if uplifting had been part of the experiments he had been through.
沉默持续了几分钟，只有墙那边企鹅 Pen-pen 满足的溅水声和叫声打破宁静。明日香好奇它是怎么加入他们的，但随即想起这只鸟似乎拥有人类水平的智慧；她猜想，它经历的实验中是否包含了某种智力提升。

"Did I ever tell you how I got this scar?" Misato suddenly asked, breaking through Asuka's idle thoughts.
"我有没有告诉过你，我这个疤是怎么来的？" 突然间，美里打破了明日香漫不经心的思绪。

She turned her head to see Misato looking down at her own stomach, the fingers of one hand grazing against the scar. "No, I don't think so," she gruffly replied.
她转过头，看到美里正低头凝视着自己的腹部，一只手的手指轻轻触碰着那道疤痕。"不，我想你没有说过，" 她粗声粗气地回答。

"My father was a researcher," said Misato, her eyes drifting up to the reddening sky. "Part of GEHIRN before it became NERV. I hardly ever saw him at home; he seemed to practically live at whatever lab he was working in. I hated whatever it was he was focused on to the exclusion of his family. My mother didn't like it either; she cried a lot when he wasn't around and eventually divorced him after having had enough.
"我父亲是个研究员，" 美里说，目光飘向渐渐染红的天空。"在 GEHIRN 变成 NERV 之前，他就是其中一员。我几乎从不在家见到他；他似乎就住在工作的实验室里。我讨厌他为了研究而忽视家庭的一切。我母亲也不喜欢这样；父亲不在时，她常常哭泣，最终在忍无可忍后与他离了婚。

"Somehow, he still managed to get joint custody of me during the divorce proceedings. Not that he ever really took advantage of it; I'd see him maybe once every few months for a day or so before he fobbed me back off onto mum with excuses of work commitments."
不知怎么的，在离婚过程中，他还是争取到了我的共同监护权。不过他从未真正利用过这一点；每隔几个月，我可能能见他一两天，然后他就会以工作为由，把我再推回给妈妈。

Brief thoughts of her own absent father flashed through Asuka's mind before she shook her head to clear them away. She held her tongue, letting Misato speak freely and sensing that she would soon get to the point.
她那缺席已久的父亲的模糊念头在明日香脑海中一闪而过，随即她摇了摇头，将这些思绪驱散。她保持沉默，让美里畅所欲言，感觉到对方即将切入正题。

"Anyway, one time he picked me up and told me to pack for cold weather," Misato continued. "I thought he meant it was going to get a little chilly and just put a few jumpers in my bag. He ended up getting another bag and stuffing my parkas and thick pants into it. At first I thought he was taking me skiing or something." She chuckled humourlessly. "Ending up in Antarctica, that felt like something of an understatement in hindsight."
总之，有一次他来接我，让我收拾些御寒衣物，"美里继续说道，"我以为只是天气会稍微变冷，就随便往包里塞了几件毛衣。结果他另外拿了个包，把我的派克大衣和厚裤子都塞了进去。起初我还以为他要带我去滑雪什么的。"她干笑一声，"最后到了南极，现在回想起来，那感觉真是轻描淡写了。

"Why the hell did he take you there of all places?" Asuka incredulously asked.
"他干嘛非得带你去那种鬼地方？"明日香难以置信地问道。

"At the time I didn't really know," replied Misato. "I thought he was just bringing me along on one of his research trips. Of course, since I was just a kid at the time, a bit younger than you are now, I had to stay inside the boundaries of the base camp where there was hardly anything to do. I was practically bored senseless after a few days, but then things got... interesting. In a bad way.
当时我也不太清楚，"美里回答，"我以为他只是带我参加一次他的研究旅行。当然，那时我还小，比你现在还小一点，只能待在基地营地的范围内，那里几乎没什么可做的。几天下来，我无聊得要命，但后来事情变得……有趣了。不过是以糟糕的方式。

"I woke up from a nap and heard alarms, there were people shouting and running around, then everything went white." Misato rubbed a hand down her face. "Next thing I know, I'm being carried by dad. There was blood on him, blood on me, and I had no idea how it got there. He put me in some kind of escape pod, gave me that Greek cross necklace you always see me wearing, and closed the hatch. That's the last thing I remember. I'm not sure how I got back to civilisation, but I was the only survivor. I spent the next two years mute from the trauma. Later I found out... I'd been at ground zero of Second Impact."
我午睡醒来，听到警报声，人们在大喊大叫，四处奔逃，然后一切变得白茫茫。" 葛城美里用手抹了把脸。"接下来我只记得被爸爸抱着。他身上有血，我身上也有血，我完全不知道血是从哪来的。他把我放进一个逃生舱，给了我那条你常看到的希腊十字架项链，然后关上了舱门。那是我最后的记忆。我不清楚自己是怎么回到文明世界的，但我是唯一的幸存者。接下来的两年，我因为创伤而失语。后来我才知道...我就在第二次冲击的中心。

Asuka quietly swore in German, both entranced and horrified by the story. An event that had killed half the population of Earth, and the woman sitting next to her had somehow survived being at the epicentre. If it wasn't for the fact that Misato wasn't the type to tell outrageous lies, at least not without more beer in her, she'd have had a hard time believing her.
明日香在心里用德语暗骂，既着迷又恐惧于这个故事。一场夺走了地球半数人口生命的事件，而坐在她旁边的女人竟然奇迹般地从震中生还。如果不是因为葛城美里不是那种会编造离谱谎言的人，至少不会在没喝更多啤酒的情况下，她会很难相信这一切。

"Anyway, after I went through college and the army, I got a job offer from NERV. I almost turned it down... but then the person offering me the job said it would let me get revenge against the Angels."
总之，我读完大学，参军之后，收到了来自 NERV 的工作邀请。我差点就拒绝了...但给我这份工作的人说，这能让我有机会向使徒复仇。

"...And that's why you're here now?" Asuka narrowed her eyes. "Revenge?"
...所以这就是你现在在这里的原因？" 明日香眯起了眼睛。"为了复仇？

"My dad saved my life. The Angels took his." Misato thought for a moment, and then shrugged. "I still don't quite know how I feel about him, but I want to... need to avenge him. To avenge the billions of dead."
我父亲救了我的命。而使徒夺走了他的。" 美里沉思了一会儿，然后耸了耸肩。"我仍然不太清楚我对他的感觉，但我想要...我需要为他报仇。为那数十亿逝去的生命报仇。

Asuka breathed in and out several times before answering. "Is that why you're so obsessed with the Angels that you'd forget about one of your pilots?"
明日香深吸了几口气，然后回答道："这就是你如此沉迷于使徒，以至于忘记了自己其中一名驾驶员的原因吗？"

"It's the only explanation I have for you, Asuka." Misato stared at her for a moment before shaking her head. "Well, how about we try and enjoy the rest of our time here, instead of fixating on the past?"
这是我能给你的唯一解释，明日香。" 美里凝视了她一会儿，然后摇了摇头。"那么，我们何不试着享受剩下的时间，而不是纠结于过去呢？

"I guess." Asuka held her nose shut and closed her eyes, dunking her head underwater. She surfaced a few seconds later and looked at Misato through watery eyes. "Just don't forget to apologise."
我猜是吧。" 明日香捏住鼻子，闭上眼睛，将头浸入水中。几秒钟后，她浮出水面，用湿润的眼睛看着美里。"别忘了道歉就行。

Misato raised an open hand to the height of her shoulder. "I promise," she sighed, before pushing herself off the rock she was sitting on and sliding into the water.
美里抬起一只手到肩膀的高度。"我保证，"她叹了口气，然后从坐着的岩石上推开，滑入水中。

Misato stayed under a little longer than Asuka had, presumably to counteract the slight chill in the air. After surfacing, she vigorously shook her head and wiped her eyes clear before getting out of the pool. "That should keep me going just long enough to duck over to the shower. Pass the shampoo?" Asuka looked around, spotting the bottle nearby, and handed it over. Misato took it and frowned, shaking it slightly. "Empty," she noted, squeezing the bottle and getting only a trickle. "Any others?"
美里在水下待的时间比明日香稍长，大概是想抵消空气中的轻微寒意。浮出水面后，她用力摇了摇头，擦干眼睛，然后离开泳池。"这样应该能让我撑到去冲个澡。递一下洗发水？" 明日香环顾四周，发现瓶子就在附近，便递了过去。美里接过瓶子，皱了皱眉，轻轻摇了摇。"空的，"她注意到，挤压瓶子只得到几滴。"还有其他的吗？"

A cursory glance of the area turned up no more bottles. Misato sighed and raised her voice. "Pen-pen, you still awake over there?"
对周围区域的粗略一瞥没有发现更多的瓶子。美里叹了口气，提高了声音。"企鹅君，你还在那边醒着吗？"

"Wark?" 咕？

"You got shampoo on that side?"
那边沾上洗发水了吗？

"...Wark." ...咕。

"Be a dear and bring it over please!"
亲爱的，麻烦你把它拿过来好吗！

"Wark." 咕噜。

Asuka blinked. "Wait, you're asking Pen-pen to... come over here? With us?!"
明日香眨了眨眼。"等等，你是在叫企鹅...过来？跟我们一起？"

Misato looked at her unconcernedly. "Yeah. What's wrong with that?"
美里不以为然地看着她。"对啊。有什么问题吗？"

"He... he..." Asuka struggled to put it into words, instead resorting to pointing at herself and Misato. "...He!"
他...他..." 明日香努力想表达，最终只是指了指自己和美里。"...他！

"Oooh!" Misato stifled a giggle. "You're worried about that. No need to worry. Pen-pen's a perfect gentleman. Gentlebird."
哦哦！" 美里掩嘴轻笑，"你在担心那个啊。不用担心，Pen-pen 是个十足的绅士，温柔的鸟儿。

"He! Us!" Desperately, Asuka pointed at her own chest.
"他！我们！" 明日香急切地指着自己的胸口。

"Bird, Asuka," Misato said with an amused sigh. "I've had him with me for years. Besides him I've lived alone all that time, and occasionally the weather got too hot for me to bother with clothes unless I was going out that day."
鸟儿，明日香，" 美里带着一丝好笑的叹息说，"我和他在一起好几年了。除了他，这些年我一直独居，偶尔天气太热，除非那天要出门，否则我连衣服都懒得穿。

"...He's seen you naked?!" Asuka gasped, her hands coming up to cover her mouth in shock.
"...他看过你裸体？！" 明日香惊呼，双手捂住嘴巴，一脸震惊。

"Yep. And trust me, he's not in the least bit interested. Birds might have breasts, but not in the same way we do."
没错。相信我，他一点兴趣都没有。鸟儿或许有胸脯，但跟我们的可不一样。

Out of sheer instinct, Asuka still held her arms across her chest when Pen-pen appeared in the doorway to their side of the spring. He gave the two of them a wave before waddling up to Misato and handing her the shampoo bottle.
出于本能，当企鹅 Pen-pen 出现在温泉这一侧的门口时，明日香仍然双臂交叉护在胸前。他向两人挥了挥手，然后摇摇摆摆地走到美里跟前，递给她洗发水瓶。

"Thanks dear," Misato said, scratching the top of Pen-pen's head, causing the bird to close his eyes and lean into her hand. She stopped after a few seconds, and the penguin shook his head before diving into the water.
"谢谢你，亲爱的。"美里说着，挠了挠 Pen-pen 头顶的羽毛，企鹅闭上眼睛，舒服地往她手上靠。几秒钟后，美里停手，Pen-pen 摇了摇头，一头扎进水里。

Slowly, cautiously, Asuka lowered her arms. Pen-pen seemed to pay her no mind, lazily backstroking in circles nearby, and she eventually relaxed her guard when Misato passed her the shampoo bottle. She ducked under the water one last time before getting out and heading over to the shower cubicles where Misato was already beginning to wash her hair.
明日香缓缓地、小心翼翼地放下手臂。Pen-pen 似乎对她毫不在意，懒洋洋地在附近仰泳转圈，她最终在美里递过洗发水瓶时放松了警惕。她最后一次潜入水中，然后起身走向淋浴间，美里已经在那里开始洗头了。

After working the shampoo in, Asuka closed her eyes and stuck her head directly under the shower head to rinse her hair out. She ran her hands along her long red mane, straightening it out as best as she could for the time being and pulling stray strands away from her face. After making sure her hair was clear of suds, she turned the shower off and headed back to the pool. Misato was lounging in the water already, and Pen-pen was now simply floating face up on the water, looking as if he were taking a nap. Asuka stared at him for a moment.
在用洗发水搓洗过后，明日香闭上眼睛，直接将头伸到花洒下冲洗头发。她用双手顺着她那头长长的红发捋直，尽可能地整理好，同时将散乱的发丝从脸庞拨开。确认头发上没有泡沫后，她关掉淋浴，返回泳池。此时，美里已经在水中悠闲地躺着，而企鹅 Pen-pen 则仰面漂浮在水上，仿佛正在小憩。明日香盯着它看了一会儿。

"...Hey Misato," she said, not taking her eyes off the penguin. "You said you rescued Pen-pen from being euthanised, right?"
“...嘿，美里，”她开口道，目光仍未离开那只企鹅。“你说过你是从安乐死中救出 Pen-pen 的，对吧？”

"That's right," Misato replied as Pen-pen drifted near her. She gave his belly a gentle rub. "Why?"
“没错，”美里回答道，此时 Pen-pen 正漂到她附近。她轻轻地抚摸了一下它的肚子。“怎么了？”

"Well... why did you decide to keep him? Couldn't you have turned him over to some wildlife organisation afterwards?"
“嗯...那你为什么决定留下它呢？你不能把它交给某个野生动物组织吗？”

"I could have... but I didn't want to."
我本可以...但我不想。

"Why? What made you decide to start looking after such an... exotic pet?"
为什么？是什么让你决定开始照顾这样一个...奇特的宠物？

Pen-pen was now floating past Asuka. He opened one eye, staring expectantly at her. With an amused huff, she rubbed his belly just as Misato did.
企鹅现在正漂过明日香身边。它睁开一只眼，期待地盯着她。她轻笑一声，像美里那样抚摸着它的肚子。

"Wark..." 呱...

Misato leaned back, looking up at the sky and back in time. "I had actually been thinking of getting a pet, since I was living on my own. I really wanted one after seeing some of the adorable animals they were working on in the genetic engineering program. I was taking a tour with the guy in charge, a man I knew well and was the reason I had heard about the program. We stopped in front of Pen-pen's enclosure, and he began talking so matter-of-factly about how the animals in the lab would end up euthanised."
碇真嗣向后一靠，仰望天空，思绪飘回往昔。“其实我那时正考虑养个宠物，毕竟一个人住。看到基因工程项目里那些可爱的动物后，我真的很想养一只。当时我正和负责人一起参观，那人我挺熟的，也是他让我知道了那个项目。我们在 Pen-pen 的围栏前停下，他开始很平淡地谈论实验室里的动物最终都会被安乐死。”

Misato's face split into a wide grin, and in front of Asuka, Pen-pen's own beak tried to mimic the expression. "When he said that, he was standing between me and the enclosure. Pen-pen came right up to the glass, looked at me and then the head scientist, and started doing this." She raised both hands, middle fingers extended, and began alternately moving her arms up and down with an angry expression on her face.
碇真嗣的脸上绽开一个灿烂的笑容，而在明日香面前，Pen-pen 的喙也试图模仿这个表情。“他说这话时，正站在我和围栏之间。Pen-pen 径直走到玻璃前，看了看我，又看了看首席科学家，然后就开始这样。”她举起双手，中指伸出，开始交替上下挥动手臂，脸上带着愤怒的表情。

And Pen-pen... sat up in the hot spring and began doing the exact same thing.
而 Pen-pen...在温泉中坐起身来，开始做着完全相同的动作。

Asuka immediately exploded with laughter. "Hahahaaaa! Oh my god!" Tears wear already streaming down her face. It certainly helped that Pen-pen was putting everything into reenacting the scene along with Misato. "That is the best thing I think I've ever heard!"
明日香立刻爆发出大笑。"哈哈哈！天啊！" 泪水已经顺着她的脸颊流下。当然，企鹅彭彭全力配合美里重演那一幕，更是锦上添花。"我觉得这是我听过的最棒的事情了！"

It took a minute for Misato to get herself back under control. Pen-pen had resumed floating on his back, but now there was an aura of smugness wafting off of him. "Heh... after that, well." She shrugged. "How could I let something... someone like that just get killed off? Because he was a lab animal I didn't even need to get a license like I would have for a 'normal' pet penguin. And to be honest? Pen-pen is only technically a pet. Legally a pet. To me... he's a fellow housemate and my best friend."
美里花了点时间才让自己重新镇定下来。彭彭已经恢复了仰泳的姿势，但现在他身上散发出一股得意的气息。"呵...在那之后，嗯。" 她耸了耸肩。"我怎么能让那样...那样的家伙就这么死去呢？因为他是一只实验动物，我甚至不需要像养'普通'宠物企鹅那样去办许可证。说实话？彭彭只是名义上的宠物。法律上的宠物。对我来说...他是同住一个屋檐下的伙伴，也是我最好的朋友。"

"Wark!" 呱！

Asuka, still smiling at the story, glanced at the divider, frowning as she finally noticed something, or rather the lack of something.
明日香听着故事，脸上仍带着微笑，她瞥了一眼隔板，突然皱起眉头，终于注意到了什么，或者更确切地说，是缺少了什么。

"Huh, I just realised something," she quietly said to Misato, paddling through the water to get close to the woman. "I haven't heard anything from the other side, have you?"
咦，我刚意识到一件事，" 她轻声对美里说，划着水靠近那位女士。"我这边一点动静都没听到，你呢？

"Finally noticed, huh?" Misato replied, her voice low. "Can you blame him though? He was almost cooked alive today."
终于察觉到了吗？" 美里低声回应，"不过，你能怪他吗？他今天差点被活活烤熟。

"Perhaps, but..." Asuka stared at where she thought Shinji might be sitting. "He should still try and enjoy our time here. He deserves it the most out of all of us." She paddled over to the divider and raised her voice. "Shinji, you... uh... got some soap over there?"
也许吧，但是..." 明日香盯着她认为真嗣可能坐着的地方。"他还是应该试着享受我们在这里的时光。我们之中，他最应该得到这份享受。" 她划向隔板，提高声音问道："真嗣，你...呃...那边有肥皂吗？

"Huh?" Asuka grinned a little at the confusion in his voice. "Uh... yeah. You need that too?"
啊？" 明日香听到他声音中的困惑，不禁微微一笑。"呃...对。你也需要吗？

"Yeah, Misato's hogging it! Just chuck it over!" She turned to Misato and put a finger over her lips. Misato nodded, sitting back and grinning widely.
"对，美里霸占着呢！直接扔过来吧！" 她转向美里，将手指放在唇上示意。美里点头，靠回椅背，咧嘴大笑。

"...Okay." ...好吧。

Somehow, Asuka knew exactly where Shinji was going to throw it. She moved along the divider, then back a few feet and held her hand up over her head. A second later, a bar of soap slapped into her waiting palm.

"Thanks!" she called out. After waiting a few seconds, she then said, "Oh, never mind, Misato's finally decided to share! Have it back."
谢啦！" 她喊道。等了几秒后，她又说："哦，算了，美里终于肯分享了！还给你吧。

Asuka lobbed the soap over the wall. As she predicted, there was no splashing to indicate a body moving through water, only the plunk of the soap landing in the spring on the other side.
明日香将肥皂扔过了墙。如她所料，没有水花四溅的声音表明有人在水里移动，只有肥皂落在另一边泉水中的扑通声。

"Bone dry," she whispered as she returned to Misato. "Damn sure he's not in the water."
“干巴巴的，”她回到美里身边时低声说，“绝对肯定他不在水里。”

"That's a shame, but what can you do?" Misato asked. "We can't exactly force him to enjoy the spring."
“真可惜，但有什么办法呢？”美里问道，“我们总不能强迫他享受温泉吧。”

Asuka froze in the act of returning to her spot at the edge of the spring. She slowly turned to face Misato. "Is that a challenge?"
明日香在返回温泉边的位置时突然停住，缓缓转过身来面对美里，“你这是在挑战我吗？”

Misato raised an eyebrow, then her hands. "Fine. Good luck." After a second's thought, she added, "You... might want to put something on before going over there though."
美里挑了挑眉，然后摊开双手。"好吧。祝你好运。" 沉思片刻后，她又补充道，"不过，你过去之前最好还是穿点什么。"

"Of course I will," Asuka retorted, her face reddening in a way that had nothing to do with the heat of the water. "No way am I giving him a free show!"
当然会的，"明日香反驳道，她的脸颊因某种与水温无关的热度而泛红。"我才不会给他白看呢！

Whatever Misato muttered under her breath, Asuka ignored it as she got out of the spring and threw a towel around herself to ward off the cool evening breeze. She headed for the change room, where she put on a certain bikini from her bag -thanking whatever staff member had brought their clothes- before heading over to the male change room. With the resort empty aside from them and the staff, she had no problems with slipping in.
无论美里低声嘀咕了什么，明日香都置若罔闻，她从温泉中起身，用毛巾裹住自己以抵御凉爽的晚风。她走向更衣室，从包里拿出一件特定的比基尼穿上——感谢不知哪位工作人员帮她们带来了衣物——然后朝男更衣室走去。由于度假村除了他们和工作人员外空无一人，她毫不费力地溜了进去。

Passing Shinji's pile of clothes, smelling faintly of whatever the medics had used on his skin, she made her way to the sliding door between the change room and the spring itself. Inching it open just enough to glance through, she saw that the water on the male side of the spring was completely devoid of brown-haired boys.
经过真嗣那堆散发着医护人员处理过的淡淡药味的衣物，她来到更衣室与温泉之间的滑动门前。她小心翼翼地将其推开一条缝，透过缝隙窥视，只见男侧温泉的水面上空无一人，不见那棕发少年的踪影。

However there was a certain young man clad in purple boxer shorts, poking at the water with a broom he'd grabbed from somewhere with his back to the door.
然而，有个身穿紫色平角裤的年轻人，正背对着门，用不知从哪儿抓来的扫帚戳着水面。

Asuka fixed the towel around herself by tucking a corner of it in at the top, making sure it wouldn't slip when she took her hands away. Hands now free, she quietly slid the door open enough for her to sneak through and closed it behind her. Silent as a prowling lioness, she padded over to Shinji, grinning when he completely failed to hear to.
明日香将毛巾的一角塞进顶部固定好，确保双手放开时不会滑落。双手解脱后，她悄无声息地将门拉开一条缝，足够自己溜进去，随后又轻轻关上。她如同潜行的母狮，蹑手蹑脚地走向真嗣，当发现他完全没察觉到自己时，不禁咧嘴一笑。

She thought of how to get his attention. The first idea that came to mind involved shoving him into the water. That was soon rejected, as Asuka didn't want to risk hurting him just for a prank, and it would be preferable for Shinji to make the decision himself. The second idea involved simply poking him, but it was immediately discarded as boring. Besides, in his shock it was entirely likely he could fall in. Shouting right next to his ear would likely do the same.
她思索着如何引起他的注意。第一个念头是把他推进水里，但很快就被否决了，因为明日香不想为了恶作剧而冒险伤到他，最好还是让真嗣自己做出反应。第二个想法是直接戳他一下，但这个主意立刻被认为太无趣。况且，他一惊之下完全可能失足落水。在他耳边大喊可能也会产生同样的效果。

Finally, she settled for slipping back into the change room and grabbing a spare towel before returning to Shinji, still moving the broom handle around in the water. Peering over his shoulder, Asuka saw that he was trying to reach the bar of soap she'd lobbed back to his side. She held the towel above his head for a few seconds, checking to make sure it would land dead on target, before letting it drop.
最终，她决定悄悄溜回更衣室，抓了一条备用毛巾，然后回到仍在水中挥动扫帚柄的真嗣身边。从他肩头探出头去，明日香看到他正试图够到她扔回他那边的肥皂。她将毛巾悬在他头顶几秒钟，确保能准确无误地落下，随后松手让它落下。

"Gah!" 啊！

Asuka laughed as Shinji shot to his feet, struggling valiantly to slay the foe that had somehow managed to wrap itself around his head. After a few amusement filled seconds, Shinji came to a stop and slowly brought his hands up to untangle the towel. As he pulled it away, Shinji's eyes locked onto her and he froze.
明日香笑了起来，因为真嗣猛地站起身，英勇地挣扎着，试图击败不知怎么缠绕在他头上的敌人。几秒钟充满欢笑后，真嗣停了下来，缓缓抬起手来解开毛巾。当他扯下毛巾时，目光与她相遇，整个人僵住了。

"Asuka?" 明日香？

She gave him an innocent look. "Yes?"
她向他投去一个无辜的眼神，“怎么了？”

"What did you do that for?!"
“你为什么要这么做？！”

"Just felt like it." “就是突然想这么做。”

Shinji stared at her for a moment before giving a rueful sigh. Clearly he had already given up on that front. "Well... why are you over here on the male side?"
真嗣盯着她看了一会儿，然后无奈地叹了口气。显然，他在这方面已经放弃了。“那么……你为什么跑到男生这边来了？”

Asuka stepped up close to him and poked him in the chest. "Because you are not enjoying this free resort trip and I know why. Oh, and before you say anything else, understand that it doesn't matter what you say, you are going to end up in the hot spring even if I have to drag you in myself."
明日香走近他，用手指戳了戳他的胸口。“因为你没有享受这次免费的度假旅行，而且我知道为什么。哦，还有，在你开口之前，明白这一点：无论你说什么，你都得去泡温泉，哪怕我得亲自把你拖进去。”

"How would you-" Shinji cut himself off, looking away for a second before returning his gaze to her. "Oh. Ramiel's beam attack, right?"
“你怎么会——” 真嗣突然打住，目光移开片刻后又转回来看着她。“哦，是雷天使的射线攻击，对吧？”

"Yeah. Took a bath afterwards and I was uncomfortable for a while." Asuka pointed a thumb at her chest. "But I toughed it out. You went through almost the same thing I did, in a way, so you can do the same." She gave him a cursory sniff. "Besides, you still smell of whatever stuff they slopped on you. I'd rather not have you stink out the car on our way home."
“对。事后我也洗了澡，当时挺难受的。” 明日香用拇指指了指自己的胸口。“但我挺过来了。某种程度上，你也经历了类似的事情，所以你也能做到。” 她随意地闻了闻他。“再说，你身上还残留着他们给你涂的那些东西的味道。我可不想回家的路上车里都是你的臭味。”

"Alright, alright," Shinji groaned. "Just... let me get the soap so I can clean myself off first." He went back to the fruitless task of using the broom handle to get the soap.
“好吧，好吧，” 真嗣呻吟道。“只是……让我先拿块肥皂，我得先把自己洗干净。” 他继续徒劳地用扫帚柄去够那块肥皂。

Asuka sighed and dropped the towel she had wrapped around her. When Shinji turned to see what she was doing, his eyes bugged out of his head. Before he had time to react, she hopped into the water and quickly retrieved the soap, tossing it back towards him. In his surprise, Shinji barely managed to hold onto the slippery bar. Asuka pointed sternly at the shower cubicles, and he made his way over and into one.
明日香叹了口气，松开了裹在身上的毛巾。当真嗣转头看她在做什么时，他的眼睛瞪得老大。还没等他反应过来，她便跳进水里迅速捞起肥皂，朝他扔了回去。真嗣惊慌失措中勉强抓住了滑溜的肥皂。明日香严肃地指了指淋浴间，他便走了过去，钻进其中一个。

Although she couldn't see what was happening, her face pinked up slightly as her mind suddenly happened to note that he would have taken his shorts off. She hurriedly turned away from the cubicles, trying to force her brain off that mental track. It was a quiet few minutes, filled only by the sounds of the -likely ice-cold- shower, before Shinji stepped out.
尽管她看不见里面的情况，但她的脸颊还是微微泛红，因为她的脑海突然意识到他应该已经脱掉了短裤。她急忙转过身去，试图让自己的思绪偏离那条思路。接下来的几分钟很安静，只听见淋浴间里传来——很可能是冰冷刺骨的——水声，直到真嗣走出来。

Hearing a sigh, Asuka turned to see Shinji staring at the hot spring as he rubbed his arm. "Are you sure about this? My skin already feels like it wants to jump off me and run away."
听到叹息声，明日香转头看见真嗣正盯着温泉，揉着胳膊。“你确定要这么做吗？我的皮肤已经感觉像是要脱离我逃跑了。”

"It's just hot water, Shinji," Asuka reasoned. "Misato and I have been in here for ages without any problems. You are not going to get scalded. Unless you get so relaxed you fall asleep, you'll be fine. Look..."
“这只是热水而已，真嗣，”明日香解释道，“我和美里已经在这里泡了很久，一点问题都没有。你不会被烫伤的。除非你太放松以至于睡着了，否则你会没事的。看……”

She jumped out of the water and grabbed him by his left wrist, pulling him along to the edge of the pool where she knelt down. Slowly and gently, she pushed his hand into the pool. Shinji gave a hiss of pain, instinctively trying to pull his hand away, but Asuka's grip was too strong. After a few seconds, Shinji seemed to settle a little.
她从水中跃出，一把抓住他的左手腕，拉着他来到泳池边，跪下身来。她缓缓而轻柔地将他的手推入水中。真嗣痛得倒吸一口凉气，本能地想抽回手，但明日香的握力太强。几秒钟后，真嗣似乎稍微平静了一些。

"See?" said Asuka, letting go of his hand. "Just like a regular pool, you'll adapt to the temperature. And just like a regular pool, it's better if you get it over with all at once." She shifted position, moving behind him and holding her hands out near his back. "Now, are you going to get in or are you going to let me do that for you?"
看到了吧？" 明日香放开他的手说，"就像普通的泳池一样，你会适应水温的。而且就像普通泳池一样，一次性跳进去会更好。" 她调整姿势，移到他身后，双手伸向他的背部。"那么，你是要自己跳进去，还是让我帮你呢？

"...Do it for me?" Shinji frowned in puzzlement.
"...帮我？" 真嗣皱着眉头，一脸困惑。

Asuka grinned. "You've got five seconds."
明日香咧嘴一笑。"给你五秒钟。"

Shinji's head twisted sharply around to stare at her. "What?"
真嗣猛地扭头瞪向她，"什么？"

"Three seconds!" 三秒！

His eyes widened as he saw her raised hands. "Oh, hell!"
他看到她举起的双手，眼睛瞪得老大，"哦，见鬼！"

"One!" 一！

"Okay okay I'm getting in!"
好了好了，我这就下去！

Shinji awkwardly pushed himself off the rocks and into the pool. His whole body tensed up upon contact with the water, and his eyes shut as he let out a long hiss. After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and took several large, rapid breaths. Eventually, his breathing slowed down as he allowed his body to gradually sink until only his head was above water, and he let out a sigh.
真嗣尴尬地从岩石上推开自己，跳进了水池。一接触到水，他全身紧绷，眼睛紧闭，发出一声长长的嘶嘶声。几秒钟后，他睁开眼睛，急促地大口呼吸。渐渐地，随着身体逐渐下沉，只剩头部露出水面，他的呼吸也平稳下来，最终发出一声叹息。

"See? What did I tell you?" Asuka enthusiastically asked.
"看吧？我怎么说的来着？" 明日香兴奋地问道。

"Yeah yeah, you've made your point," Shinji grumbled. He then blinked and looked down at the water. "Oh right, I'm still wearing my shorts..."
是是是，你说的都对，" 真嗣嘟囔着。然后他眨了眨眼，低头看向水面。"哦对，我还穿着短裤呢……

"I'd damn well hope so," said Asuka. "We might be good friends but I'm not going to skinny dip with you."
我当然希望如此，"明日香说道，"我们可能是好朋友，但我可不会跟你裸泳。

"...With me?" ...跟我？

Asuka smirked and hopped back into the water, the resulting wave ending up splashing his face. "Yeah," she replied after wiping her eyes clear. "I don't feel like traipsing all the way back to the other side just to sit around. Besides..." She narrowed her eyes at the divider and lowered her voice. "Pen-pen's over there and I don't really trust him."
明日香咧嘴一笑，跳回水中，激起的水花溅了他一脸。"对啊，"她擦了擦眼睛，回答道，"我不想大老远再游回对岸干坐着。再说..."她眯起眼睛看向分隔板，压低了声音，"那边有企鹅，我可不太信任它。"

Shinji glanced at the divider, then back at Asuka. "But... he's a bird," he lamely replied.
真嗣瞥了一眼分隔板，又看向明日香。"但是...它只是只鸟啊，"他无力地反驳道。

Asuka growled in frustration. "Until I see him looking at... I dunno, Playvian, I'm gonna stay suspicious."
明日香恼怒地咆哮道：“除非我看到他盯着……我不知道，比如说‘Playvian’，否则我都会保持怀疑。”

"What's 'Playvian' supposed to be?" His attempt at the non-existent English word was almost amusing.
“‘Playvian’是什么鬼东西？”他试图发音这个不存在的英文单词，几乎让人发笑。

"...Never you mind. Probably don't have what I'm referring to over here anyway."
“……别管了。你们这儿可能也没有我说的那个东西。”

Shinji blinked at her a few times, before sitting down in the water against the rock wall opposite Asuka's position. She immediately got up and moved to sit only a couple feet away from him. At his confused look, she said, "So, tell me how things went from your perspective. Not every day you get dunked into a volcano to snatch an egg and end up stabbing a monster."
真嗣眨了几下眼睛，然后坐在了与明日香位置相对的岩壁旁的浅水中。她立刻起身，挪到离他仅几英尺的地方坐下。面对他困惑的表情，她说：“那么，从你的角度告诉我，事情是怎么发展的。毕竟不是每天都有机会跳进火山里抢个蛋，最后还捅了个怪物。”

XXX

Eventually, all good things had to come to an end. Asuka was unhappy to have to leave the resort, asking if they could stay the night. Misato hemmed and hawed for a bit, claiming that they were rather far away from the Geofront, but acquiesced after making sure that a VTOL would be able to collect them in case of emergency. A look at the inn's breakfast menu certainly helped her decide.
终究，美好的时光总要画上句点。明日香不情愿地离开度假村，询问是否能留宿一晚。美里犹豫了一会儿，声称他们离第三新东京市相当远，但在确认紧急情况下会有垂直起降飞机来接应后，便同意了。瞥了一眼旅馆的早餐菜单，无疑也帮她下了决心。

As Asuka opened the door to her assigned room, out of the corner of her eye she saw Misato put a hand on Shinji's shoulder just as he was head into his own room. Their guardian was talking in a low voice, so Asuka couldn't hear what they were saying, but she was pretty sure she knew what was happening. The way Shinji shook his head and smiled at Misato told Asuka everything she needed to know.
当明日香打开自己房间的门时，眼角余光瞥见美里正将手搭在即将进入自己房间的碇真嗣肩上。他们的监护人低声说着什么，明日香听不清内容，但她很确定自己知道发生了什么。真嗣摇头微笑回应美里的方式，让明日香了然于心。

There was a smile on her face as well when she closed her door.
她关门时，脸上也挂着微笑。

### Chapter 21 Matarael

"Could you two please stop doing that?"
你们俩能不能别这样了？

Shinji paused, glancing over the table at Kensuke. "Stop what?" he asked.
真嗣停了下来，越过桌子看向了健介。"别什么？"他问道。

"That!" Kensuke pointed at Shinji and the person next to him.
"就是那个！"健介指着真嗣和他旁边的人。

Blinking in confusion, Shinji turned his head to the right where Asuka was sitting. She, too, had stopped eating her ice cream cone and turned her head towards him with a look of puzzlement on her face. They both glanced at Kensuke out of the corners of their eyes, and the corners of their mouths on the side that Kensuke couldn't see tilted ever so slightly upwards.
真嗣困惑地眨了眨眼，转头看向坐在他右边的明日香。她也停下了吃冰淇淋的动作，带着一脸疑惑地转头看向他。两人都用眼角余光瞥向健介，而在健介看不见的那一侧嘴角，微微上扬。

"Why, whatever do you mean?" Shinji asked as he turned back to Kensuke, his words perfectly mirrored by Asuka. "We're just eating our ice cream, same as you."
哎呀，你这话是什么意思？" 真嗣转头向健介问道，他的话被明日香完美地重复了一遍。"我们只是在吃冰淇淋，和你一样啊。

"Gnnhhhh!" Kensuke twitched in his seat, looking as if he was desperate to escape.
"呃啊啊！" 健介在座位上抽搐着，看起来像是拼命想要逃离。

"What's the matter, Aida?" Asuka asked, innocent concern in her voice. "You look like-"
怎么了，相田？" 明日香关切地问道，声音里带着无辜的担忧。"你看起来像是——

"-you've just seen a ghost," Shinji finished.
"——刚见了鬼似的，" 真嗣接话道。

It was a dirty trick, both their synchronised speaking and continuing each other's sentences, but Shinji felt like a little revenge was in order. After all, Kensuke had spent most of lunchtime bugging them with questions about NERV and the Evangelions after somehow hearing about the Mount Asama incident, with Toji nowhere in sight to rein him in.
这招真够损的，他们不仅同步说话，还接续对方的句子，但真嗣觉得来点小小的报复也无妨。毕竟，健介大部分午餐时间都在缠着他们问关于 NERV 和 EVA 的事，显然是听说了浅间山事件，而东治又不在场来制止他。

When asked how he had found out about the incident, Kensuke had simply claimed that his father worked at NERV. Asuka had immediately scoffed in derision, stating that that was 'such an old thing', before Rei had interjected with confirmation of a light-haired, glasses-wearing man on the engineering team with the surname 'Aida' that looked remarkably similar to Kensuke. Asuka had immediately shut up.
当被问及如何得知此事时，健介只是声称他父亲在 NERV 工作。明日香立刻嗤之以鼻，说那“太老套了”，随后绫波插话证实，工程队里确实有个姓相田的金发眼镜男，长得和健介惊人地相似。明日香顿时哑口无言。

"Please stop," Hikari pleaded in the tone of an exasperated authority figure. "If you keep it up you might break his brain."
请别这样了，" 光以一种无奈的权威口吻恳求道，"再继续下去，你们可能会把他脑子搞坏的。

"Oh, alright," Asuka relented after a glance at Shinji to let him know the game was over. "But only because you're the ones paying for this."
好吧，" 明日香瞥了真嗣一眼后让步了，暗示游戏结束，"但那只是因为你们是买单的人。

Toji, Kensuke and Hikari had pooled their money together after the two boys had insisted on rewarding the pilots for their efforts by taking them to an ice cream parlour. Rei had been invited along as well, despite her protests that she had had nothing to do with their previous Angel engagement, but gave in when Kensuke had simply brushed that concern off, stating that he and the other two were doing it for all their efforts.
冬二、剑介和光在两位男孩坚持要奖励飞行员们的努力后，凑钱带他们去了一家冰淇淋店。尽管绫波抗议说她与他们之前的使徒战斗无关，但还是被邀请了。当剑介简单地忽略了她的担忧，表示这是为了他们所有人的努力时，她最终还是妥协了。

And neither Shinji nor Asuka were about to turn down a free cold treat on a hot day like today. The only downside had been how far off their normal route home the place was, but the delicious frosty treats more than made up for it.
而今天这样的炎热天气，真嗣和明日香自然也不会拒绝免费的冷饮。唯一的缺点是这家店离他们回家的常规路线很远，但美味的冰凉甜品足以弥补这一点。

"I do not see what the problem is with Shinji and Asuka's synchronisation," Rei remarked, not taking her eyes off her ice-cream. "It is a beautiful thing to watch; two people in tune with each other to such a degree."
“我不明白真嗣和明日香的同步有什么问题，”绫波评论道，目光未曾离开她的冰淇淋。“看着两个人如此和谐地同步，是一件美妙的事情。”

"They're only doin' it because they find your reactions funny," Toji added, before taking a bite out of his cone. "I'll bet they don't do it when they're at home."
“他们这么做只是因为他们觉得你的反应很有趣，”冬二补充道，随后咬了一口他的蛋卷。“我敢打赌，他们在家里不会这样。”

"Ehhhh..." Asuka waved a hand in a so-so gesture. "We do cook our meals together, which tends to result in things like Shinji practically chucking things into a pot without seeing where it is. I can't even remember the last time we accidentally bumped into each other either."
呃……" 明日香摆了摆手，做出一副马马虎虎的样子。"我们确实是一起做饭，结果往往是真嗣几乎不看就把东西扔进锅里。我都记不清上次我们不小心撞到对方是什么时候了。

Kensuke dismissively waved a hand. "You could argue that it's just experience that allows you two to do that, not like your weirdo synchro talk-y thing."
健介不以为然地挥了挥手。"你可以认为这只是经验让你们俩能做到这一点，而不是你们那种奇怪的同步对话。"

"Whoah, slow down, Einstein," Asuka mockingly replied in a sarcastic monotone, putting her hands up. "Mind dumbing it down for the rest of us?"
哇，慢点，爱因斯坦，" 明日香用讽刺的单调语气嘲讽地回答，举起双手。"能不能为其他人简化一下你的高见？

In response, Kensuke merely gave her a look over the top of his glasses before returning his attention to his ice-cream.
对此，健介只是从眼镜上方瞥了她一眼，然后又把注意力转回到他的冰淇淋上。

XXX

There was not a cloud in the sky above Tokyo-3, giving the oppressive sun free reign to bake the city. Shinji wasn't surprised that the city seemed relatively quiet. Who would want to go outside where they'd end up cooked? He could see the heat radiating off the road in places, and the few people that were brave or crazy enough to stay outside seemed to be worn down by the high temperature, judging by how slow they were moving.
东京-3 的天空万里无云，炽烈的阳光肆无忌惮地炙烤着城市。真嗣并不意外城市显得相对宁静。谁愿意出门，结果被烤得焦头烂额呢？他能看到路面上有些地方热浪滚滚，而那些勇敢或疯狂到敢于留在户外的人，似乎也被高温折磨得步履蹒跚，从他们缓慢的移动中可见一斑。

He was seriously considering buying more ice-cream to stick in the freezer at home. A lot more. Enough to require using Misato's freezer as well, and perhaps Pen-pen would just have to make do with slightly less living space until this latest heat-wave was over.
他正认真考虑着要买更多冰淇淋塞进家里的冰箱。很多很多。多到需要用到美里小姐的冰箱，或许在这波热浪结束前，企鹅彭彭就只能将就一下，少占点生活空间了。

Shinji and the others ended up moving quickly from shadow to shadow in order to seek refuge on their way home. Then Asuka decided to take a 'shortcut' by routing the group through a mall.
真嗣和其他人为了在回家的路上寻求庇护，不得不迅速从一个阴影转移到另一个阴影。接着，明日香决定带大家抄一条“近路”，穿过一家商场。

"This isn't... really on the way," Hikari demurred, but she changed her tune as soon as the automatic doors opened. "Ooohhh that's much better..."
这其实……并不顺路吧，"光有些迟疑地说，但自动门一开，她立刻改口了。"哦哦，这样舒服多了……

Now they were slowing down for a different reason: to enjoy the miracle of air conditioning for as long as possible. Even Rei seemed much livelier after getting a blast of cool air in the face.
现在他们减速的原因不同了：为了尽可能久地享受空调带来的奇迹。就连绫波也似乎在迎面吹来一阵凉风后精神了许多。

"So Aida," Asuka abruptly said after a few minutes, glancing sidelong at Kensuke. "Been keeping your nose clean?"
那么，相田，"明日香几分钟后突然说道，斜眼瞥了瞥洞木光。"你最近有没有老实点？

"What?" Kensuke jumped a little at the sudden question, then looked shifty. "Y-yeah, of course I have!"
什么？"洞木光被这突如其来的问题吓了一跳，然后显得有些心虚。"当、当然，我一直都很规矩！

"What's this?" Shinji asked. "Did he do something wrong?"
这是怎么回事？"真嗣问道，"他做错什么事了吗？

"Oh right, you weren't there when we caught him," Asuka replied, before getting Shinji up to speed on Kensuke's former stealth photography side-business. When the story was over, he found himself directing a glare at his two friends.
"哦对了，你当时不在场，我们抓到他的时候，" 明日香回答道，随后向真嗣讲述了健介以前的偷拍副业。故事讲完后，他发现自己正怒视着两位朋友。

"Hey, we're outta that now!" Toji argued. "Red 'n Class Rep shut us down ages ago!"
嘿，我们现在不干那个了！" 东治辩解道，"红和班长早就让我们停手了！

"I'm not so sure," Asuka retorted, stopping in the middle of the walkway where she turned around to stare quizzically at Kensuke.
"我可不太相信，" 明日香反驳道，她在人行道中间停下脚步，转过身来，疑惑地盯着健介。

"W-what he said!" Kensuke stammered, his hands held up in front of him.
"他、他说的没错！" 健介结结巴巴地说，双手举在胸前。

Asuka stared at him a little longer. "You say that, but you hesitated when I asked you."
明日香又盯着他看了一会儿。“你这么说，但当我问你的时候，你犹豫了。”

"Well... you surprised me with the question!" Kensuke brought his hands back to his chest and began to fidget with the camera hanging from its strap around his neck. Shinji wasn't sure why he had brought it out while they were just going home, but at this point he was used to Kensuke randomly snapping shots of whatever the latest thing was to catch his eye.
“这个嘛...你那问题让我措手不及！”健介双手放回胸前，开始摆弄挂在脖子上的相机带子。真嗣不明白他们只是回家，健介为何要拿出相机，但此时他已经习惯了健介随时随地对着吸引他眼球的任何东西随机拍照。

Asuka thoughtfully nodded. "Maybe... maybe." She stared intensely at him. "Or maybe you're still doing something shady."
明日香若有所思地点点头。“也许...也许是吧。”她目光锐利地盯着他。“或者，你还在搞什么鬼鬼祟祟的事。”

Hikari moved up to stand beside Asuka. "Aida, what are you doing now?" she demanded, effortlessly slipping back into her role as class representative.
光走到明日香身边。“相田，你现在又在搞什么名堂？”她质问道，轻松地回到了班长的角色。

Kensuke protectively cradled his camera, angling his body so as to put something between it and the two suspicious girls. "N-nothing, I swear! I'm legit now!"
健介小心翼翼地抱着他的相机，调整身体角度，试图在它和那两个可疑女孩之间隔开点什么。“我发誓，没什么！我现在可是正经人！”

"Look Ken, even I'm gettin' suspicious now," said Toji, folding his arms. "Whatever it is, just come clean before ya get in even more shit."
“看吧，健，连我都开始起疑心了，”东二抱着双臂说，“不管是什么，趁早坦白，免得越陷越深。”

Kensuke's eyes darted around, resting on each of his friends for a second or two. When he saw that none of them were about to relent, he sighed as his whole body sagged. "Wasn't even my idea this time," he darkly mumbled. "Or my choice."
健介的眼珠四处游移，每扫过一位朋友就停留一两秒。见他们无人肯让步，他叹了口气，整个人都垮了下来。“这次真不是我的主意，”他低声嘟囔，语气中带着一丝阴郁，“也不是我选的。”

"Not your choice?" Hikari echoed. "Aida, what's going on? What have you gotten yourself into this time?"
“不是你的选择？”光重复道，“相田，到底怎么回事？这次你又把自己卷进什么麻烦里了？”

A thought occurred to Shinji, and he gave voice to it. "Did somebody find out about your... hobby?" Kensuke nodded dolefully. "And they're... making you do something by threatening to out you?" Another nod.
真嗣脑海中闪过一个念头，便脱口而出：“是不是有人发现了你的...爱好？”剑介沮丧地点了点头。“他们...是不是在威胁你，逼你做些什么？”他又点了点头。

"Who the hell's threatenin' ya?!" Toji exploded, drawing the attention of several passersby. "Tell me who he is and I'll lay 'im out!"
“到底是谁在威胁你？！”东治怒吼道，引得几个路人侧目。“告诉我他是谁，我非把他打趴下不可！”

"Suzuhara!" Hikari glared at him, resulting in the athletic teen shrinking away from her.
“铃原！”光瞪了他一眼，让这位运动健将不由自主地退缩了。

"You're not going to lay anyone out," said Kensuke.
“你不会去打任何人的，”剑介说道。

Toji growled. "Wanna bet? I don't care if it's a student or a teacher, nobody threatens my friends 'n gets away with it!"
冬二咆哮道：“敢不敢赌？不管是学生还是老师，敢威胁我朋友的人，我绝不会让他好过！”

Glancing over his glasses at him, Kensuke smirked. "Actually, I'm sure you wouldn't lay a finger on her."
健介透过眼镜斜瞥了他一眼，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。“说实话，我敢肯定你不会动她一根手指头。”

That brought Toji up short, along with everybody else. "Her?" Hikari and Toji said at the same time, followed closely by Asuka and Shinji.
这话让冬二愣住了，其他人也跟着一愣。“她？”光和冬二异口同声地说，紧接着是明日香和真嗣。

"Yeah, her," Kensuke repeated. "She found out about my former... business when she saw a photo her brother had. Apparently she 'asked' him who had taken it and got pointed towards me."
“对，就是她，”健介重复道。“她从她哥哥那里看到一张照片，发现了我的过去……生意。显然，她‘询问’了他照片是谁拍的，然后就被指向了我。”

"...I don't get it," said Asuka. "Does this girl want you to keep taking photos or something?"
...我不明白，"明日香说，"这女孩是想让你继续给她拍照还是怎么的？

Kensuke shrugged. "Sort of. She wants me to photograph her."
健介耸了耸肩。"差不多吧。她想让我给她拍照。"

Everybody in the group reeled back in disbelief, casting glances at each other.
小组里的每个人都震惊地后退一步，互相投去疑惑的目光。

"...Why?!" Hikari incredulously asked. "And... who?!"
...为什么？！"光难以置信地问，"还有...谁？！

"Uh..." Kensuke scratched his head in thought for a moment. "Natsumi Akera, I think. A third year."
呃..." 健介挠了挠头，思索片刻后说："我想是赤座夏美，三年级的。

"Oh, I know her," the class representative replied, disapprovingly narrowing her eyes. "Kind of. By reputation, mostly. She's in my sister's class, and Kodama occasionally complains about Akera's... relationship habits."
哦，我知道她，" 班长回答道，不满地眯起了眼睛。"算是吧。主要是通过传闻。她和我姐姐同班，小玉偶尔会抱怨赤座的...恋爱习惯。

"Habits?" asked Shinji. "习惯？" 真嗣问道。

"Pretty sure she means that Akera keeps bouncing from boy to boy," Asuka clarified, rolling her eyes in disgust when Hikari nodded her confirmation.
"肯定是说赤座不停地换男朋友，" 明日香解释道，当光点头确认时，她厌恶地翻了个白眼。

"I haven't actually done anything yet," said Kensuke. "Akera said that she's not quite ready for the photos, but she'll let me know when she... wants my services." He lifted his camera slightly for emphasis.
"我其实还没开始做什么呢，"健介说。"明里说她还没准备好拍照，但会告诉我什么时候...需要我的服务。"他微微举起相机以示强调。

"Why does this Akera want you to take a photo of her?" Rei asked. "Does she not have a camera at home, or friends she could ask?"
这个明里为什么要你给她拍照？"玲问。"她家里没有相机吗，或者不能找朋友帮忙？

Kensuke shrugged helplessly. "I really don't know. Maybe she thinks I'm talented?"
健介无奈地耸了耸肩。"我真的不知道。也许她觉得我有才华？"

Toji chortled in derisive amusement. "How much 'talent' does it take ta point a camera and press a button?"
透二嗤笑一声，带着嘲讽的意味。"对着相机按个按钮，这需要多少'才华'？"

Before Kensuke could offer a rebuttal, everything suddenly went dark. The teenagers looked around to see that every light in the mall had shut off, leaving the skylights as the only source of illumination. Other people were also looking around, murmuring to each other, and some were heading for the exits.
还没等剑介反驳，四周突然一片漆黑。少年们环顾四周，发现商场里的灯光全部熄灭了，只剩下天窗透进来的光亮。其他人也在四处张望，互相低声交谈，有些人正朝出口走去。

"Blackout?" asked Shinji. "Did the power stations break down in the heat or something?"
停电了？" 真嗣问道，"是不是发电站在高温下出故障了？

"Could it be an Angel?!" Kensuke asked, sounding almost excited.
"会不会是使徒？！" 剑介问道，语气中带着一丝兴奋。

"There was no alarm," reasoned Rei. "Early warning systems would have detected it and sounded the alert well before it reached the city."
没有警报，" 绫波分析道，"预警系统应该会在它接近城市之前就探测到并发出警报。

As one, Shinji and Asuka pulled their phones out of their pockets and flipped them open. "Nothing from NERV either," noted Asuka. "The Geofront has its own power plants too. Maybe it's just a problem at the plant up here."
同步地，真嗣和明日香从口袋里掏出手机，翻开盖子。“NERV 那边也没消息，”明日香指出，“地下都市也有自己的发电厂。可能只是地面上的电厂出了问题。”

"Nothing we can do then," Shinji said with a shrug. "Should we just continue home?"
“那我们也没办法了，”真嗣耸耸肩说，“要不我们就直接回家？”

"May as well," replied Asuka. "It's gonna start getting hot in here soon anyway, and I really want a cold shower."
“也行，”明日香回答，“反正这里很快就会热起来，我还真想冲个冷水澡。”

"Great, no air-con on a day like this," Toji moaned as the group headed for the nearest exit.
“真是的，这种天气连空调都没了，”当一行人朝最近的出口走去时，东治抱怨道。

Outside, the sun was still burning bright. Shinji sighed as he brought up a hand to shade his eyes. "I hope you know where we're going, Asuka, because the sun's not going anywhere for a while."
外面，太阳依旧炽烈地照耀着。真嗣叹了口气，举起一只手遮挡眼睛。“希望你知道我们要去哪儿，明日香，因为这太阳一时半会儿是不会落下的。”

"Of course I do!" Asuka retorted with a huff. "Have you still not studied a map of Tokyo-3 to know where all weapon buildings and defensive emplacements are?"
“我当然知道！”明日香哼了一声反驳道。“你还没研究过第三新东京市的地图，了解所有武器建筑和防御设施的位置吗？”

Shinji abashedly rubbed the back of his head. "Well... since I'd mostly be riding along with you, I thought..."
真嗣尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺。“那个……因为大部分时间我都是跟你一起行动，所以我想……”

Rolling her eyes, Asuka set off down the street. "No excuses. Learn," she said as she passed him. A moment later, the others followed suit. Shinji groaned in defeat, then trailed after them.
明日香翻了个白眼，沿着街道走去。“别找借口。学着点，”她经过他时说道。片刻后，其他人也跟了上去。真嗣无奈地呻吟一声，随后也跟了上去。

"Kensuke, do you really have no idea why Akera specifically chose you for this... photo shoot?" Hikari asked after a few minutes.
"健介，你真的不知道为什么明里偏偏选中你来参加这个...摄影活动吗？" 几分钟后，光问道。

"Like I said, maybe she recognises talent," Kensuke replied with a shrug. "Dunno why she had to threaten me to do it though."
就像我说的，可能她认出了我的才华吧，" 健介耸了耸肩回答。"不过，真不明白她为什么非得威胁我才肯让我拍。

"Prob'ly so she wouldn't have to pay ya," Toji suggested. "Why pay for somethin' you could get just by leanin' on someone, ya know? And she does kinda have ya in a tough spot."
大概是为了不用付你钱吧，" 徹提议道。"为什么非要花钱买东西，靠施压就能得到呢，你懂的？而且她确实把你逼到了一个难处。

"Really, it's all his fault for being in that tough spot in the first place," said Asuka. "All he had to do was not take photos of girls without permission."
说到底，都是他自己一开始就陷入了那种困境，" 明日香说。"他只要不未经允许就拍女生的照片就行了。

"Yeah, yeah, I get it already!" Kensuke almost shouted. "Nobody to blame but myself, blah bl-" He stopped, quirking an eyebrow as he looked back the way they came. "...Did you hear that?"
行了行了，我明白了！" 健介几乎喊了出来。"都是我自找的，啰嗦个没完——" 他突然停下，挑起一边眉毛，回头望向来时的路。"...你听见了吗？

Everybody stopped and turned to face the same way. Shinji scanned the street, but couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. There was not a person or car in sight, but the hot weather meant that that wasn't a surprise.
众人纷纷停下脚步，转头望向同一方向。真嗣扫视街道，却未发现任何异常。四周不见人影车踪，但炎热的天气本就让人稀少，这并不意外。

"There's nothing there," scoffed Asuka after a few tense seconds. "Don't try and change the subject."
什么都没有嘛，" 几秒钟紧张的沉默后，明日香嗤之以鼻。"别转移话题。

"No, I... heard something too," Rei interjected. "But... I cannot place what it was."
不，我...也听到了什么，" 绫波插话道。"但是...我无法确定是什么声音。

Shinji blinked several times in surprise, turning to look at Rei. Her eyes were narrowed in suspicion and her hands were curled into fists as she cast her gaze about the area. "There it is again," she suddenly said, raising a hand.
真嗣惊讶地眨了几次眼，转头看向绫波。她的眼睛眯成一条缝，带着怀疑，双手紧握成拳，目光四处扫视。“又来了，”她突然说道，举起一只手。

"...Ya sure you two ain't just imaginin' things?" Toji asked. "The street's empty. Ain't nothin' there but concrete bein' cooked. Maybe the heat's just startin' to get to ya."
“...你们俩确定不是在胡思乱想吗？” 东治问道，“街上空荡荡的。除了被烤热的混凝土，啥也没有。可能是热浪开始影响你们了。”

Shinji almost begrudgingly agreed with the jock, right up until he felt a faint vibration in his feet, coinciding with the just barely heard sound of something heavy hitting the ground. He swallowed nervously, trying to bring moisture back to his suddenly dry mouth. "Now I'm hearing it too," he quietly said.
真嗣几乎有些不情愿地同意了这位运动员的话，直到他感觉到脚下传来轻微的震动，伴随着几乎听不见的重物落地的声音。他紧张地咽了咽口水，试图让突然干涩的嘴巴恢复湿润。“现在我也听到了，”他低声说道。

Asuka gave a serious nod. "Yeah, me too..."
明日香认真地点了点头。“是的，我也是...”

Toji sighed and put his hands up. "Fine, there's somethin' happening. Whatever it is, it don't concern us. Can't be an Angel after all, right? No phone call from NERV. Could just be construction somewhere nearby."
冬二叹了口气，举起双手。“好吧，确实有什么事在发生。不管是什么，反正跟我们无关。毕竟不可能是使徒吧？NERV 那边也没来电话。可能只是附近有什么建筑工程。”

"I... believe it might be an Angel," Rei said in a low voice. She turned to face the others. "We should g-"
“我……认为可能是使徒。”绫波低声说道，随即转向其他人。“我们应该……”

"What?" Hikari asked, when Rei continued to stare silently at her. "Is something wrong, Rei?"
“什么？”班长问道，因为绫波继续沉默地盯着她。“怎么了，绫波？”

As slow as a glacier, Rei raised a hand to point towards Hikari. Or rather, as Shinji soon noticed, something behind her. The other teenagers slowly turned around. What they saw made Shinji's heart leap into his throat. Something had sneaked up behind them. A huge, somewhat ovoid something. With many triangular eyes. Staring right at them.
绫波缓缓地举起一只手，指向班长。或者说，是真嗣很快注意到，指向班长身后的某物。其他少年们也慢慢转过身去。他们所见之景让真嗣的心一下子提到了嗓子眼。有什么东西悄无声息地接近了他们。一个巨大的、略呈卵形的物体。上面布满了许多三角形的眼睛。正直勾勾地盯着他们。

Eventually, Shinji managed to tear his own eyes away from the main body of the creature to see that it was suspended on four legs so big that just the... 'knees'... seemed to rival the height of most skyscrapers.
最终，真嗣费力地将视线从那生物的主体上移开，发现它竟是由四条巨腿支撑着，光是那所谓的“膝盖”就似乎能与大多数摩天大楼比肩。

"Holy shit," Toji whispered. "How'd that thing manage to get here?"
我靠，" 东治低声惊呼，"那玩意儿是怎么跑到这儿来的？

As if to show the boy how it was done, the creature began to move. Its ovoid body drew closer to the ground as its front left leg lifted up. Ever so slowly, the Angel -it had to be one, Shinji decided- moved closer and closer, its legs coming down almost gently on the ground several dozen metres away, while the teenagers seemed to be frozen where they stood. It soon came to a stop mere metres from Hikari, who was trembling like a leaf in a hurricane. She then proceeded to faint, only to swiftly be caught by a quick-witted Toji, who slowly dragged her a couple metres away.
仿佛要向少年展示自己的行动方式，那生物开始移动。它的卵形身体向地面靠近，前左腿随之抬起。缓缓地，那被真嗣认定必是使徒的生物，一步步逼近，其腿脚几乎轻柔地落在几十米外的地面上，而那些少年们却仿佛被定在原地。不久，它停在了离光只有几米远的地方，光此时颤抖得如同飓风中的树叶。她随即昏厥过去，幸而被机敏的东治迅速扶住，并慢慢将她拖离了几米远。

This left the three Children as the only thing standing between an Angel and their friends. An Angel that seemed incredibly interested in them, moving its body slightly so that it could look at all of them. Its triangular eyes appeared to be merely decorative, as brightly coloured as an insect's markings, but there was nothing pretty about the way the irises shifted about inside the triangles.
这使得三个孩子成了唯一挡在天使和他们朋友之间的屏障。这位天使似乎对他们极为感兴趣，微微移动身体以便能同时看到他们所有人。它那三角形的眼睛看似只是装饰，色彩鲜艳如同昆虫的斑纹，但眼珠在三角形内游移的方式却毫无美感可言。

'We are so, so very far away from our Evangelions right now,' Shinji glumly thought. He then heard what sounded like a quiet, mechanical shutter opening and closing. Turning his head to the left, he was completely unsurprised to see Kensuke with his camera in front of his face.
'我们现在离我们的福音战士真是太远了，' 真嗣沮丧地想。接着，他听到了像是轻微的机械快门开合的声音。转头向左一看，果然不出所料，是拿着相机对准自己的剑介。

The Angel moved again, bringing one of its eyes closer and focusing it on Asuka from only about a metre away. To her credit, Asuka didn't so much as blink in the face of an eye as big as she was. In fact, it looked to Shinji as if she was about to haul off and punch it.
天使再次移动，将其中一只眼睛拉近，仅在一米开外聚焦在明日香身上。值得称赞的是，明日香面对一个和自己一样大的眼睛，竟然连眼皮都没眨一下。实际上，在真嗣看来，她似乎正准备挥拳打过去。

Shinji couldn't stop himself from flinching as the Angel turned its attention on him. It seemed to stare right through him, the eye moving up and down several times as if it were scanning him from head to toe.
真嗣无法控制自己，当天使的注意力转向他时，他不禁缩了一下。那眼睛仿佛能看穿他，上下移动了好几次，就像在从头到脚扫描他一样。

And then it shifted its attention to Rei who, unsurprisingly, faced it with the same calm demeanour she normally employed throughout the day. The sole concession to acknowledging the danger they were in was the way her fists were once again clenched at her sides.
随后，它将注意力转向了绫波，不出所料，她以平日里一贯的沉着态度面对它，唯一显示出他们所处危险的是她再次紧握在身侧的双拳。

What was surprising, however, was how the Angel seemed to rear back slightly after scanning her. If it had eyelids, Shinji was sure that it would be blinking in confusion. Then, with the suddenness of a bully changing their mind about picking a fight with somebody who might not be a weakling, the Angel pulled its body up away from the ground and began to walk off. As it passed the Children, its eyes kept an... well... kept an eye on them until its body rounded a building and left their sight.
然而，令人惊讶的是，天使在扫描她之后似乎微微后仰。如果它有眼睑，真嗣确信它会困惑地眨眼。接着，就像一个恶霸突然改变主意，不想与可能并非弱者的人打架一样，天使将身体从地面抬起，开始走开。当它经过孩子们时，它的眼睛一直……嗯……一直盯着他们，直到它的身体绕过一栋建筑，从他们的视线中消失。

Kensuke was the first to speak. "Did you guys just stare down an Angel?!"
第一个开口的是剑介。“你们刚才难道是瞪退了一个天使？！”

Shinji sucked in a harsh breath as he remembered to breath, and he heard Asuka do the same. They looked at each other for a moment, serious expressions on their faces, before Asuka folded her arms.
真嗣猛吸一口气，这才想起呼吸，同时他也听到明日香做了同样的动作。他们彼此对视了一会儿，脸上都是严肃的表情，随后明日香交叉双臂。

"We need to get to NERV," she announced, then glanced around. "Where's the nearest entrance?"
我们得去 NERV 总部，"她宣布道，随后环顾四周。"最近的入口在哪里？

"Follow me," said Rei, moving ahead. She then paused for a moment, looking back at Toji and a recovering Hikari. "You should come too."
跟我来，"绫波说道，向前走去。她停顿了一下，回头看向东治和正在恢复的光。"你们也应该一起来。

"Wait," Asuka interjected. "I'm not suggesting we leave them out here, but are you really saying we should bring civvies into the Geofront?"
等等，"明日香插话道。"我不是说要把他们留在外面，但你真的认为我们应该带平民进入地下都市吗？

Rei nodded. "The Angel is between us and the nearest shelter. There is no guarantee they will be safe if they try to go that way."
绫波点头。"天使挡在我们和最近的避难所之间。如果他们试图往那边走，并不能保证他们的安全。"

Shinji glanced up. The Angel's long, spindly legs could still be seen over the tops of the nearby buildings. "Good point. Lead the way."
真嗣抬头望去，天使那细长的腿依然在附近建筑的顶端若隐若现。“有道理，你带路吧。”

Kensuke's squeal of delight was probably loud enough to draw the attention of the Angel.
健介兴奋的尖叫声可能大到足以引起天使的注意。

After a few seconds to ensure that Hikari was alright, the teenagers set off; Rei taking the lead as they all ran at a fast jog. It only took them a couple of minutes to reach the entrance Rei was heading towards, which consisted of a roofed enclosure with several security doors for personnel and two larger doors for vehicles. Shinji wiped the sweat off his brow, grateful for some shade. Rei took her identity card out and attempted to swipe it through the scanner by one of the doors, only for absolutely nothing to happen.
确认光没事之后，几秒钟后，少年们便出发了；零带头，大家以快步跑的速度前进。他们只用了几分钟就到达了零所指的入口，那是一个有顶棚的围栏，里面有几扇人员安全门和两扇较大的车辆门。真嗣擦了擦额头上的汗水，庆幸能有片阴凉。零拿出身份卡，试图在门旁的扫描器上刷卡，却毫无反应。

"Strange," she murmured before trying again. There was still no response.
“奇怪，”她低声自语，再次尝试。依旧没有任何回应。

"Guess NERV did lose power too," Asuka remarked, trying her own card on another door. "What now?"
看来 NERV 也断电了，"明日香说着，尝试用自己的卡片去刷另一扇门。"现在怎么办？

"There is an emergency access route nearby," Rei said after a moment's thought. She looked around. "It is... this way."
附近有一条紧急通道，"绫波丽沉思片刻后说道。她环顾四周，"是这边。

As they set off again, heading down a corridor, Shinji heard a low conversation behind him.
当他们再次出发，沿着走廊前行时，真嗣听到身后传来低声交谈。

"Hey Class Rep, you... uh... alright now?"
喂，班长，你...呃...现在还好吗？

"Um... y-yes, thank you Suzuhara."
呃...嗯，是的，谢谢你，铃原。

"Ya sure? Your face is still really red. Maybe you got heat stroke or somethin'."
真的没事？你脸还红着呢。可能是中暑了吧。

Shinji took a second to glance behind him. Hikari's face was rather flushed, still, and Toji's face was also somewhat pink as well. He looked back in front of him to see a sturdy-looking door coming up.
真嗣回头瞥了一眼，只见光的脸颊依旧泛着红晕，而东治的脸色也略显粉红。他转头向前望去，一扇结实的门正逐渐映入眼帘。

"'Or something' sounds about right," said Kensuke, sounding like he was trying not to laugh.
"‘或者别的什么’，说得挺对的，" 健介说道，听起来像是在努力忍住笑意。

"What are ya on about, Ken?"
你在说什么呢，肯？

"Oh, nothing. I just noticed that you're still holding on to her, though."
哦，没什么。我只是注意到你还扶着她。

"Yeah, I don't want her to fall over again, ya dingus!"
是啊，我不想让她再摔倒了，你个笨蛋！

"This is it," Rei declared, stopping in front of the door and pointing at the device next to it. "It's manually operated by this lever."
就是这儿，" 零宣告着，在门前停下，指着旁边的装置。"这门是手动操作的，用这个杠杆。

"That makes things a bit easier," said Asuka, before turning to Shinji. "Think you can get it open for us?"
这样事情就简单些了，"飞鸟说着转向真嗣，"你觉得你能帮我们打开它吗？

Shinji looked at the lever for a moment. "Doesn't look too difficult," he said as he stepped up to it, placing both hands on the handle and pulling down. It took quite a bit more force than he was expecting, and he groaned when he discovered that it was a rotating lever mechanism. With a grunt of effort, he forced the lever up to the top of the wheel and back down for another rotation.
真嗣盯着杠杆看了一会儿。"看起来不太难，"他说着走上前去，双手握住把手向下拉。他没想到需要这么大的力气，当他发现这是一个旋转杠杆机制时，不禁呻吟了一声。他用力一哼，将杠杆推到轮子的顶部，然后又转了一圈。

This resulted in the door opening to a massive gap of... a couple of centimetres, to Shinji's great dismay.
结果门只打开了一个巨大的缝隙……几厘米，这让真嗣大失所望。

"Yo Shin-man, want some help?" Toji offered.
"嘿，真嗣，需要帮忙吗？" 东治主动提出。

Shinji resolutely shook his head. "No space," he muttered as he turned the lever again.
真嗣坚决地摇了摇头。“没空间了，”他嘟囔着，再次转动把手。

"Don't push yourself, Shinji," Asuka warned. "If it's too much, let someone else have a go. We still have an Angel to fight."
“别勉强自己，真嗣，”明日香警告道。“如果太吃力，就让别人试试。我们还有天使要对付。”

Pausing for a second, Shinji turned his head slightly to glance at Asuka out of the corner of his eye. With a low growl deep in his throat he pushed harder, turning the lever faster.
真嗣停顿了一下，微微侧头，用眼角余光瞥了明日香一眼。他喉咙深处发出低沉的咆哮，更加用力地推动，加快了转动手柄的速度。

Finally, after what felt like an hour, the door was open just enough for all of them to squeeze through. Shinji let his aching arms fall to his side as his friends filed through the doorway. Just as he was about to do the same, he felt a hand on his shoulder.
终于，在仿佛过了一个小时后，门终于打开到足够所有人挤过去的宽度。真嗣让酸痛的手臂垂下，看着朋友们一个个穿过门口。就在他也要跟着进去时，他感觉到一只手搭在了他的肩上。

"You alright?" Asuka asked, a note of worry in her voice.
"你没事吧？"明日香问道，声音中带着一丝担忧。

Shinji just stared at her for a moment before shaking her hand off. "'m fine," he mumbled as he went through the doorway.
真嗣只是盯着她看了一会儿，然后甩开了她的手。"我没事，"他嘟囔着穿过门口。

"Sheesh, sorry for being concerned," Asuka snapped at his back. She then pushed past him and caught up to Rei, who was waiting for them. "You seem to know your way around, Wondergirl. Wanna take the lead and get us where we need to go?"
真是的，关心你还错了。"明日香冲着他的背影嚷道。随后她挤过他，赶上了正在等他们的绫波。"看来你对这里挺熟的，奇迹女孩。要不要带个路，领我们去该去的地方？

Rei nodded. "Very well. Follow me, and be careful. The lighting will be poor ahead and we will need to use a ladder."
绫波点了点头。"好的。跟我来，小心点。前面的光线会很暗，我们得用梯子。"

As she said, the corridor they walked down was lit only by dim red emergency lighting. Shinji stumbled along in near-blindness trying to keep up with the fast-moving Rei, his worry steadily growing as the minutes ticked on. Even though they had been face to face with the Angel threatening the city, he had no idea what it was capable of. And as far away from it as they were now, it could already be laying waste to the city for all he knew.
正如她所说，他们走过的走廊仅靠昏暗的红色应急灯照明。真嗣在近乎失明的状态下踉跄前行，努力跟上快速移动的绫波，随着时间的推移，他的担忧逐渐加深。尽管他们曾直面威胁城市的使徒，但他对它的能力一无所知。而现在他们离它这么远，它可能已经在肆虐城市了，他无从得知。

The group reached the ladder, and at Asuka's... insistence... the boys went first. Toji seemed somewhat reluctant to let go of Hikari, who was still red-faced, but he ended up being the first to descend. The sound of his shoes on the rungs soon faded away, reminding Shinji of just how far down below the surface the Geofront was as he got onto the ladder.
一行人到达了梯子旁，在明日香...的坚持下...男生们先上。东治似乎有些不舍放开仍面红耳赤的光，但最终还是第一个下去。他鞋底敲击梯级的声音很快消失，提醒着真嗣，他们所在的第三新东京市地下有多深，当他踏上梯子时。

A couple tense minutes later, his feet finally touched solid ground again and he moved away from the ladder to allow Kensuke to come down. Remembering Asuka's warning, or rather her threat, all three boys took a few steps down the corridor and kept their eyes off the ladder until the girls were all off of it. Another minute of fast walking led them towards a tunnel blocked by fallen debris.
几分钟后，他的脚终于再次触到了坚实地面，他离开梯子让健介下来。想起明日香的警告，或者说是她的威胁，三个男生都往走廊走了几步，并避开视线，直到女孩们都从梯子上下来。又是一阵快步，他们来到了一个被坍塌瓦砾堵住的隧道前。

"Uh, Rei..." said Shinji. "Did you accidentally take us the wrong way?"
呃，绫波..." 碇真嗣开口道，"你是不是不小心带错路了？

Asuka grinned smugly and folded her arms. "After she said she knew which way to go, too."
明日香得意地咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉在胸前。"尤其是在她说她知道怎么走之后。"

"This was the correct way," Rei stiffly replied, shooting the two of them an icy look. "The collapse must have happened recently." She hummed in thought as she looked around, her eyes stopping on a metal grate in the wall. "We will have to go through this air vent."
这条路没错，" 绫波冷冷地回应，同时向两人投去冰冷的目光。"应该是最近才塌的。" 她沉吟着环顾四周，目光停留在一面墙上的金属格栅上。"我们得从这通风管道过去。

"...You're kiddin' right?" Toji said, gawping at the vent cover. "Now we gotta crawl the rest of the way?"
...你不是在开玩笑吧？" 东治瞪大眼睛看着通风口盖子，"难道接下来我们得爬过去？

"I'm wondering how she even knows the ventilation system well enough to know that," quipped Kensuke. "Maybe she's secretly a ninja or something."
我真好奇她怎么对通风系统这么了解，" 健介打趣道，"难不成她其实是忍者之类的？

"Just shut up and get moving," Asuka growled as she pulled the vent cover out of the way. "Rei, you'll have to go first to guide us. But if any of you boys dare try and look up her skirt..."
闭嘴，快点走，" 明日香一边把通风口盖子挪开，一边咆哮着，"零，你得先走，给我们带路。不过，你们谁要是敢偷看她的裙子下面……

Toji and Kensuke paled. Shinji stepped past them and got down onto his hands and knees to follow Rei. Craning his neck to be able to see her, he happened to notice that Asuka's threat was pointless; The uniform dresses were long enough that the girls' modesty would be protected anyway.
彻和健介脸色一白。真嗣从他们身边走过，跪下双手撑地跟在零后面。他伸长脖子想看清楚，却意外发现明日香的威胁多余了；制服裙摆够长，足以保护女生的端庄。

He heard a loud thump behind him, and he paused. "What was that?" he called out behind him, his voice echoing through the metal vent.
他听到身后传来一声巨响，便停了下来。"那是什么声音？" 他回头喊道，声音在金属通风管道中回荡。

"Just my camera," Kensuke replied. "Bit awkward to crawl with it around my neck."
就我的相机，" 健介回答道，"挂在脖子上爬行有点尴尬。

"Hurry the hell up before I solve that problem for you!" Asuka shouted.
"快点，不然我帮你解决那个问题！" 明日香吼道。

Kensuke gave a yelp and quickened his pace.
健介惊叫一声，加快了脚步。

"How much further do we have to go, Rei?" Shinji asked after an awkward minute.
"我们还得走多远，绫波？" 尴尬的一分钟后，真嗣问道。

"We are almost there," came the stoic reply. "In fact..." Rei came to a halt and flipped over onto her back. She then raised a foot and began to slam it onto the metal just in front of Shinji's face. In the darkness, it took him a moment to realise that there was actually a vent cover that she was trying to remove.
"我们快到了，"传来一个沉着冷静的回答。"事实上……" 零停下脚步，翻了个身仰面躺下。接着，她抬起一只脚，开始猛击真嗣脸前方的金属板。在黑暗中，他花了一会儿才意识到，她正试图移开的是一个通风口的盖子。

"What's the hold up?" came Asuka's exasperated question. "And that damn racket?"
怎么回事？"明日香不耐烦地问道，"还有那该死的噪音？

"Rei's trying to ope-" A shriek of metal interrupted Shinji. "...Rei's just opened the way out," he corrected.
"零正在尝试打——" 一声金属撕裂的尖叫打断了真嗣。"...零刚打开了出口，"他纠正道。

"Be careful," Rei warned. "There is a rather large drop."
小心点，"零警告说，"下面有个相当大的落差。

Shinji nodded, and carefully eased himself through the hole. Grabbing onto the edge, he let his body dangle for a moment before summoning up the courage to let go. He hit the ground hard, bending his knees to absorb the shock, but still felt a jolt of pain in his legs.
真嗣点了点头，小心翼翼地从洞口钻了进去。他抓住边缘，让身体悬空片刻，鼓起勇气后松手落下。他重重地着地，屈膝缓冲，但腿部仍感到一阵剧痛。

"Ah, about time you arrived."
啊，你总算到了。

Shinji looked up to see the smiling face of Doctor Akagi, as well as Lieutenant Ibuki standing nearby. "We were starting to get a little worried," she added.
真嗣抬头一看，只见赤木博士面带微笑，以及站在一旁的伊吹少尉。"我们刚才还有点担心呢，"她补充道。

"Look out below!" 小心下面！

Looking up, Shinji squeaked and ducked out of the way as Kensuke almost fell on top of him. Doctor Akagi raised an eyebrow. "You brought civilians into the Geofront?" she disapprovingly asked.
抬头一看，真嗣惊叫一声，急忙躲开，险些被几乎要摔倒在他身上的剑介压到。赤木博士挑了挑眉，不悦地问道：“你把平民带进了地下都市？”

"Um, yes ma'am," Shinji admitted.
“呃，是的，女士，”真嗣承认道。

With no warning, Rei suddenly dropped down next. She almost managed to stick the landing, but then her right leg gave out and she fell to the ground. "It was... my idea, Doctor," she said, one hand grasping at the leg that had failed her, before looking up.
毫无预兆地，绫波突然也跳了下来。她几乎成功着陆，但随即右腿一软，整个人摔倒在地。“这是……我的主意，博士，”她一手抓着失力的腿，抬头说道。

Shinji did the same, seeing Toji preparing to make the drop, and pulled Kensuke out of the way just as their friend landed. Toji stepped aside, and Shinji saw Asuka's head peeking over the edge of the gap then retreat. Moments later there was a muffled curse. He quickly put his arms up, and almost immediately they were full of a now-blushing redhead.
真嗣也抬头望去，只见东治正准备跳下，他赶紧将剑介拉开，就在这时他们的朋友落地了。东治闪到一旁，真嗣看到明日香的脑袋从缺口边缘探出又缩回。片刻后传来一声含糊的咒骂。他迅速举起双臂，几乎立刻就被一个满脸通红的红发少女扑了个满怀。

"Er... t-thanks Shinji," Asuka stammered before swiftly moving away.
"呃...谢、谢谢你，真嗣，"明日香结巴着说道，随即迅速走开。

Toji helped Hikari land safely, and Shinji finally had the chance to look around. He raised his eyebrows in astonishment when he realised that Rei had led them directly to Unit-01's cage. Doctor Akagi was busy checking Rei over after her landing. For some reason, Rei was now also clutching at her head.
东治帮助光安全着陆，而真嗣终于有机会环顾四周。当他意识到绫波已经直接将他们带到了零号机的笼子时，他惊讶地扬起了眉毛。赤木博士正忙着检查绫波的状况，因为她着陆后，不知为何，绫波也开始捂着头。

"Prepare for manual entry!" came a deep-voiced shout. Shinji blinked, recognising the voice. He looked up near Unit-01's head to see... his father standing on the catwalk, ordering the engineers around.
"准备手动进入！"一个低沉的声音喊道。真嗣眨了眨眼，认出了这个声音。他抬头望向零号机的头部附近，看到...他的父亲站在走道上，指挥着工程师们。

"How are you prepping the Evas with no power?" Kensuke wondered aloud.
"没有电力，你们是怎么准备使徒的？"健介不解地大声问道。

"With electrical power down, we've had to resort to manpower," Doctor Akagi explained, sparing a glance their way and waving a hand at Unit-01's head. "The Commander got everything going."
由于电力中断，我们不得不依靠人力，"赤木博士解释道，向那边瞥了一眼，并挥手示意零号机的头部。"指挥官让一切运转起来了。

"...What?" Shinji couldn't believe his ears. Looking up at the catwalk again, he was amazed to see his father working with the engineers to pull on a chain. Even from this distance in the dim light, he could see oil stains on his father's normally-pristine white gloves. He blinked in disbelief, before remembering something important. "Oh right. We've already made visual contact with the Angel," he reported.
"...什么？" 真嗣不敢相信自己的耳朵。再次抬头望向天桥，他惊讶地看到父亲正与工程师们一起拉动链条。即使在昏暗的光线下，从这么远的距离，他也能看到父亲那双通常一尘不染的白手套上的油渍。他眨了眨眼，难以置信，然后想起了重要的事情。"哦对了。我们已经与使徒进行了视觉接触，"他报告说。

"Oh?" Doctor Akagi replied. "What can you tell us?"
哦？" 赤木博士回应道。"你能告诉我们什么？

"It looks like a giant spider," said Shinji. "Only with four really long legs. Its main body also seems to be covered with eyes." He shivered, remembering the thing staring directly at him and the other two pilots.
"它看起来像一只巨大的蜘蛛，"真嗣说，"只是有四条特别长的腿。它的主体似乎也布满了眼睛。"他打了个寒颤，回想起那东西直勾勾地盯着他和另外两位驾驶员的情景。

The scientist seemed to sense something was amiss. "Did something happen up there?" she pressed.
科学家似乎察觉到了异样。“上面发生了什么事吗？”她追问道。

"It..." Shinji ran a hand through his hair. "It... came right up to us."
“它...” 真嗣用手捋了捋头发。“它...直接向我们靠近了。”

"What?!" “什么？！”

"What he said is true," confirmed Rei, waving off Doctor Akagi's assistance as she stood up. "The Angel appeared interested in us."
“他说的没错，” 绫波确认道，挥手拒绝了赤木博士的搀扶，自己站了起来。“那个使徒对我们表现出了兴趣。”

"Yeah, but these guys were cold as ice!" Toji pridefully exclaimed, clenching a fist. "Stared right back at the stupid thing until it gave up and wandered off!"
对，但这些家伙冷得像冰一样！" 东治自豪地喊道，紧握拳头。"直勾勾地盯着那蠢东西，直到它放弃走开！

"The Angel was then in between us and the nearest shelter," Rei added. "That is why I asked these three to come with us."
那时使徒正好挡在我们和最近的避难所之间，" 绫波补充道。"所以我才叫这三位跟我们一起。

Doctor Akagi stared at them, before shaking her head. "...We'll have to give all of you a thorough debriefing," she said. "Later though. Right now we need to get you into your Evas."
赤木博士盯着他们，然后摇了摇头。"...我们得给你们所有人做个彻底的汇报，" 她说。"不过稍后再说。现在得让你们进入 EVA。"

Shinji nodded, and ran off with Asuka and Rei. After the fastest change into a plugsuit he had ever performed, he returned to the cages hot on Asuka's heels. He was following her to Unit-02 when a shout caught his attention.
真嗣点头，与明日香和绫波一起跑开。以他有史以来最快的速度换上插入栓服后，他紧跟在明日香后面回到机库。他正跟着她前往二号机时，一声呼喊吸引了他的注意。

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

He skidded to a halt on the metal floor, turning and looking up at Unit-01's head where the call had originated. His father was leaning over the railing, beckoning Shinji towards him. Shinji rubbed the back of his head, embarrassed that he'd been heading to Unit-02 out of sheer habit, as he hurried up to the entry plug.
他在金属地板上急停，转身抬头望向初号机的头部，呼唤声正是从那里传来。他的父亲正俯身在栏杆上，招手示意真嗣过去。真嗣尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，意识到自己纯粹出于习惯正朝二号机走去，于是急忙向插入栓跑去。

"Sorry, father," he sheepishly said as he came up to the Commander. "I didn't realise all three were needed."
对不起，父亲，" 他怯生生地对指挥官说道，"我没意识到三台都需要出动。

Gendo stared at him for a moment, before saying, "Your lack of an AT-Field is a non-issue here. With no power cable, the AT-Field is essentially off-limits. Even the battery backups we've mounted on the Evas won't be enough for sustained usage."
源渡凝视了他片刻，然后说："你缺乏 AT 力场在这里不是问题。没有电源线，AT 力场实际上无法使用。即便我们在 EVA 上安装了备用电池，也不足以支持持续作战。"

Shinji nodded, glancing at the long black objects mounted to Unit-01's shoulder pylons. "How long will they give us?" he asked as he stepped up to the entry plug.
真嗣点了点头，瞥了一眼安装在初号机肩部支架上的长形黑色物体。“他们会给我们多长时间？”他边问边走向插入栓。

"An extra five minutes at most," Gendo replied. "But the majority of that time is needed to reach the Angel."
“最多额外五分钟，”源渡回答道，“但大部分时间需要用来接近使徒。”

After climbing into the plug, Shinji got himself situated in the pilot seat.
爬进插入栓后，真嗣在驾驶座上调整好位置。

"Shinji." 真嗣。

"Huh?" He turned in his seat to look towards the hatch. His father was leaning in, still staring at him. Or through him. It was difficult to tell with the tinted glasses.
“嗯？”他转身望向舱门，父亲正倚在那里，依旧凝视着他，或者说透过他。那副有色眼镜让人难以分辨。

"Is what that boy said about you coming face to face with the Angel true?"
那男孩说你曾直面天使，这是真的吗？

Shinji blinked several times. "Y-yes, father," he stammered. "Is something wrong?"
真嗣眨了几次眼。"是-是的，父亲，"他结巴着回答。"有什么问题吗？"

"Hrm." Rather than giving a proper response, Gendo simply hummed and stared at him for a few more seconds before pulling his head out of the plug and sealing the hatch. Utterly confused, Shinji sat back in his seat and wondered what that was about.
"嗯。"源渡并未给出明确回应，只是哼了一声，又盯着他看了几秒，随后将头从插入栓中抽出，封上了舱门。真嗣完全摸不着头脑，只好坐回座位，纳闷这究竟是怎么一回事。

XXX

"Somehow, this is even worse than crawling through the ventilation system in a school uniform!" Asuka groused as the three Evangelions crawled along the metal tunnel on their bellies. "This is so undignified!"
说起来，这比穿着校服爬通风管道还要糟糕！"明日香抱怨道，三台福音战士正匍匐在金属隧道中前行。"太没尊严了！

"With no power for the launch catapults, this is the only way to reach the Angel," Rei replied.
"由于发射弹射器无法使用，这是唯一能接近使徒的方法，" 绫波丽回答道。

"Doesn't mean I have to like it!"
并不意味着我必须喜欢这样！

"Well we're almost there," said Shinji, glancing at the holographic map. "The shaft underneath the Angel is just a few hundred metres away." He gave Asuka's comm channel a half-smirk. "I think you can last that long."
我们快到了，" 碇真嗣说着，瞥了一眼全息地图。"使徒下方的通道只有几百米远了。" 他对着明日香的通讯频道半带嘲讽地笑了笑。"我想你能坚持那么久。

"Smart-ass." 自作聪明。

The shaft in question was blocked by a blast door, but even that wasn't rated against the strength of Unit-02's boot. A few kicks was all it took to remove that obstacle and send it crashing down to the depths below.
那条通道被一道防爆门堵住了，但这根本挡不住二号机的脚力。几脚下去，障碍物便被踢开，轰然坠入深渊。

"The shaft will be narrow enough to climb," Rei reported when Unit-02 glanced out.
“通道狭窄，足以攀爬。”零号机向外一瞥后，绫波报告道。

"Good, because I just happened to leave my climbing gear at home today," Asuka snarked before moving into the shaft and beginning to ascend. Unit-00 was close behind, and Unit-01 brought up the rear. The smooth metal wall should have made the climb difficult, if not impossible, but the designers of the Evangelion had apparently accounted for something like this, as Shinji couldn't feel Unit-01's boots slipping at all.
“太好了，因为我今天恰好把攀岩装备忘在家里了。”明日香嘲讽一句，随即进入通道开始攀登。零号机紧随其后，初号机则殿后。光滑的金属墙壁本应让攀爬变得困难，甚至不可能，但显然，设计者们预料到了这种情况，因为真嗣感觉初号机的靴子丝毫没有打滑。

Just as he thought they'd be able to make it all the way to the top, Shinji saw something orange flash past his view screen, and then an alert screen popped up in front of his face. Something was wrong with one of his backup batteries. He glanced up at it to see a viscous liquid eating away at it.
正当真嗣以为他们能一路爬到顶时，一道橙光突然掠过他的显示屏，紧接着一个警告窗口弹出在他面前。他的一个备用电池出了问题。他抬头一看，只见一种粘稠液体正侵蚀着电池。

"Is it... dropping acid on us?!" he exclaimed in shock.
"难道是...在对我们泼酸?!" 他震惊地喊道。

"What the hell?!" 搞什么鬼?!

The shout drew Shinji's attention up to Unit-02, just in time to see more acid fall on it. Losing its grip, the red Evangelion fell back down the shaft, colliding with Unit-00 and causing that to also fall. Thinking quickly, Shinji shifted Unit-01's position, spreading it out in a star shape to catch them. Both Evangelions crashed hard onto Unit-01's back, sending it sliding down as well until Shinji managed to force his hands and feet against the shaft with enough force to arrest their uncontrolled descent. They ended up coming to a stop just under the tunnel they had entered from.
那声呼喊让真嗣抬头望向二号机，恰好目睹更多酸液落在其上。失去抓握的红色福音战士向后坠落，与零号机相撞，导致后者也一同下坠。真嗣迅速反应，调整初号机的姿势，展开成星形以接住它们。两台福音战士重重砸在初号机背上，使其也滑落下去，直到真嗣用力将手脚撑在竖井壁上，才止住了失控的坠落。他们最终停在了进入时的隧道下方。

"Phew. Nice save, Shinji!" said Asuka as Unit-02 clambered back into the tunnel. It extended a hand to Unit-00, who grabbed it and got hauled in. With the weight off his back. Shinji carefully walked Unit-01's hands and feet up the wall and eventually ended up back in the tunnel with a helping hand from the other two Evangelions.
"呼，救得漂亮，真嗣！" 明日香说道，此时二号机正爬回隧道。它伸出一只手给零号机，后者抓住并被拉了进去。背上的重量一减轻，真嗣便小心翼翼地让初号机手脚并用，沿着墙壁攀爬，最终在另外两台福音战士的帮助下，也回到了隧道中。

"Had to pay you back somehow," Shinji replied once Unit-01's feet were on solid ground.
"总得还你个人情，" 碇真嗣在初号机双脚踏上坚实地面后回应道。

"What? You don't owe me-" Asuka sighed and shook her head. "Forget it, we've got bigger problems."
什么？你并不欠我——" 明日香叹了口气，摇摇头，"算了，我们还有更大的麻烦。

"We appear to have dropped our rifles," Rei noted, Unit-00's arm patting at the spot where its Pallet Rifle once sat. "Most likely they are at the bottom of the shaft, about three hundred metres down from here."
看来我们的步枪掉了，" 绫波丽指出，零号机的手臂在原本放置调色板步枪的位置摸索着，"很可能它们已经落到了竖井底部，距离我们大约三百米。

"If they're down there, they could be melted as well for all we know," Asuka moaned.
"如果它们真的在那下面，说不定已经融化了，谁知道呢，" 明日香抱怨道。

As the one closest to the shaft, Shinji risked sticking Unit-01's head out just far enough to look down. He switched his display's vision to low-light mode and scanned the bottom of the shaft. There was a ragged hole melted into the metal, and he could just make out what appeared to be a gun-shaped lump.
作为离竖井最近的人，真嗣冒险让初号机探出头，刚好能向下窥视。他将显示屏的视觉模式切换到低光环境，并扫描竖井底部。那里有一个熔穿的金属大洞，隐约可见一个枪械形状的物体。

"I think I can see one of our rifles," he reported. "There's a big hole in the floor down there though."
“我想我看到了我们的一把步枪，”他报告说，“但下面地板上有个大洞。”

"Good, at least one of our guns survived," said Asuka. "Now we just need a plan."
“好，至少有一把枪幸存下来了，”明日香说，“现在我们只需要一个计划。”

"We should eject our backup batteries," Rei suggested, putting actions to words. "They are empty and will only weigh us down now."
“我们应该弹出备用电池，”绫波提议道，边说边行动，“它们已经耗尽，现在只会拖累我们。”

Shinji nodded, hitting a button to drop the rectangular batteries to the ground. Unit-02 swiftly picked one up and squeezed past Unit-01 to sit at the edge of the tunnel.
真嗣点头，按下按钮将矩形电池投放到地面。二号机迅速拾起一个，侧身挤过初号机，坐到了隧道边缘。

"Asuka, what are you doing?" Shinji asked, staring at the red Evangelion as it waved the spent battery about in the shaft.
"明日香，你在做什么？" 真嗣问道，目光紧盯着红色使徒在通道中挥舞着用过的电池。

"The Angel's not attacking right now," Asuka replied, still waving the battery. "I'm seeing if it's reacting to mov- yes it is," she hastily added as a glob of acid nearly landed on her Evangelion's hand. She dropped the battery and turned back to them. "It knows we're here and it looks like it's waiting for us."
天使现在没有攻击，" 明日香回答，依旧挥动着电池。"我在看它是否对移动有反应——是的，它有反应，" 她急忙补充，因为一团酸液差点落在她的使徒手上。她丢下电池，转回身对他们说："它知道我们在这里，看起来像是在等我们。

"There is not enough time to find an alternate route," said Rei as their power timers collectively hit the three minute mark. "We must attack from here."
没有足够的时间寻找其他路线，" 丽说道，此时他们的能量计时器集体指向了三分钟。"我们必须从这里发起攻击。

"Yep. And I've got just the plan!" Asuka grinned. "There won't be any time to mess around, so we need to do this swiftly and correctly! One of us needs to go up and shield the others from the acid, one of us needs to go down and grab the rifle, then throw it up to the third person who'll take the shot."
没错。而且我正好有个计划！" 明日香咧嘴一笑，"我们没时间瞎折腾，必须迅速且准确地行动！我们中得有人上去挡住酸液，有人得下去拿枪，然后扔给第三个人，由他来开枪。

"I volunteer for shield duty," Rei immediately said.
"我自愿承担盾牌任务。" 绫波立刻说道。

"No way, Wondergirl," replied Asuka, shaking her head. "You're the best shot out of the three of us, and I plan to be the shield."
想得美，奇迹女孩，" 明日香摇头回应，"你是我们三个中枪法最好的，我打算自己当盾牌。

Rei stared at her for a moment. "... Accuracy will not be an issue at this distance," she stiffly said. "But I shall comply."
绫波盯着她看了一会儿，"...在这个距离上，准确性不是问题，" 她生硬地说，"但我会遵从安排。"

"Guess I'm grabbing the gun," said Shinji, glancing at the shaft.
"看来是我去拿枪了," 真嗣说着, 瞥了一眼竖井。

Asuka nodded. "Yeah, you already know exactly where it is, so I'm sending you down there. Right, any questions?" Neither Shinji nor Rei had anything to say. "Good! Let's move out!"
明日香点头道: "对, 你已经知道枪的确切位置了, 所以我派你下去。好了, 有什么问题吗?" 真嗣和零都没有说话。"好! 出发!"

Unit-02 charged out into the shaft, quickly climbing up above the tunnel exit and spreading out like Unit-01 had. "Go go go!" Asuka shouted as the Angel began its attack.
二号机冲进竖井, 迅速爬升至隧道出口上方, 像初号机一样展开。"快快快!" 明日香喊道, 此时使徒开始发起攻击。

Shinji crawled out and dropped down the shaft, firing Unit-01's pylon-mounted retro-rockets to slow its fall. The damaged metal of the acid-burned floor began to slowly sag under the Evangelion's weight. He heard some crashing sounds above him as Unit-00 dug its feet and shoulders into the shaft wall to sit in place.
真嗣爬出并跃入竖井, 启动初号机翼下挂载的反推火箭以减缓下落速度。被酸液腐蚀的地板在福音战士的重压下开始缓慢下沉。他听到上方传来撞击声, 那是零号机将脚和肩膀嵌入竖井壁中, 稳稳地坐定。

"I am in position, Ikari!"
我已就位，碇！

"Right!" Shinji grabbed the rifle and gave it a quick check. Luck was on their side, as the only damage it had received was some tiny acid holes in the stock. "Here comes the gun!" he shouted as he threw the rifle up to Rei.
"好的！" 真嗣抓住步枪，迅速检查了一番。幸运的是，枪支仅在枪托上留下了几个微小的酸蚀孔洞。"枪来了！" 他大喊着将步枪抛给绫波。

"Hurry up!" Asuka yelled, groaning in pain as Unit-02's back was repeatedly splashed with acid.
"快点！" 明日香痛苦地喊道，随着二号机背部不断被酸液溅射，她发出阵阵呻吟。

Rei took a few agonisingly long seconds to line up the shot, before calling out, "Soryu, move!"
绫波花了令人煎熬的几秒钟瞄准，随后喊道："惣流，移动！"

Shinji couldn't see well past Unit-00, but he heard Asuka say, "I'm clear!" at almost exactly the same time Rei opened fire, emptying the rifle's magazine skyward. When the gun clicked empty, she let it drop back down towards Shinji and held Unit-00's arms out just in time to catch Unit-02. The impact sent Unit-00 sliding down the shaft until friction brought the two of them to a halt just above Unit-01's head.
真嗣透过零号机看不清楚，但几乎在听到明日香说“我没事！”的同时，绫波发射了步枪，将弹匣中的子弹尽数射向天空。当枪发出空膛的咔哒声时，她松手让枪落下，正好掉向真嗣，同时伸出零号机的双臂，及时接住了二号机。撞击使得零号机沿着竖井滑下，直到摩擦力让两者停在了初号机头顶上方。

"Did we do it?" Shinji nervously asked, moving Unit-01 to give him a clear view upward. Something was blocking the light that had been coming through the hole leading to the surface.
“我们成功了吗？”真嗣紧张地问道，操控初号机移动，以便向上方清晰地望去。有什么东西挡住了原本从通往地面的洞口透进来的光线。

"The Angel is neutralised," replied Rei, and Shinji thought he heard a hint of satisfaction in her voice.
“使徒已被制服，”绫波回答道，真嗣觉得她的声音中似乎带着一丝满足。

"Good," said Asuka. "By the way, Wondergirl, I'm grateful for the save but it feels like everybody's catching me today!"
“很好，”明日香说，“对了，冰山美人，虽然感谢你救了我，但今天好像人人都来接我似的！”

"Perhaps you should stop falling from unsafe heights then."
或许你该停止从危险的高度坠落了。

Asuka groaned, her head dropping to her chest. "Great, I'm surrounded by smart-asses today as well..."
明日香嘟囔着，头垂到了胸前。"真好，今天我周围也都是些自作聪明的人……"

There was no way, even through the comm windows, that Shinji could miss the slight upward tilt to Rei's lips. "You are welcome, Soryu."
即便透过通讯窗口，真嗣也不可能错过绫波嘴角微微上扬的弧度。"不客气，惣流。"

"Could you, uh, hurry up and move out of the way please?" Shinji begged, looking nervously at the damaged floor beneath his Evangelion's feet. "You know, before I'm the one that ends up falling next?"
那个，你能快点挪开吗？" 真嗣恳求道，紧张地看着脚下受损的地板。"你知道的，在我成为下一个坠落的人之前？

Shinji wasn't sure whether to believe the power outage was caused by 'Matarael', as the Angel was now being designated, but the fact that NERV had power as the Evangelions returned in triumph was certainly something to consider. It at least made returning their Units to the cages easier, along with showering and finding his way to the debriefing room where Doctor Akagi, a strangely frazzled-looking Misato, and their three friends were waiting. As was to be expected, Kensuke tried to press them for details on their assault before a pointed throat-clearing from Misato got him to sit back down.
真嗣不确定是否应该相信这次停电是由“马特拉尔”，即现在被称作使徒的存在所引起的，但 NERV 在 EVA 胜利归来时仍有电力供应，这一点确实值得深思。至少，这使得将他们的机体送回笼子、洗澡以及找到前往简报室的路变得更加容易，在那里，阿基拉博士、看起来异常焦躁的美里以及他们的三位朋友正在等待。不出所料，剑介试图向他们追问攻击的细节，但美里一声刻意的清嗓子让他重新坐了回去。

The sight of Misato reminded Shinji that their guardian hadn't been around while the Evangelions were being prepped, and he wondered what had happened to her. The only answer he ended up getting was that she and Kaji had been stuck in an elevator for the duration of the power outage.
看到美里的身影，真嗣想起了在他们准备 EVA 时，他们的监护人并不在场，他好奇美里去了哪里。他得到的唯一答案是，她和加持在停电期间被困在了电梯里。

His father was nowhere to be seen, though. Shinji didn't know what to think of that, considering how he had seen him acting earlier.
然而，他的父亲却不见踪影。真嗣对此感到困惑，考虑到他之前所见到的父亲的行为。

Nothing really tangible could be gleaned from when Matarael had examined the pilots, except that its interest in them was unusual, as was the way it simply wandered off instead of attacking. Misato theorised that it might have had something to do with Asuka and Shinji's unique situation, something which caused some confusion with their civilian friends, but to Shinji that didn't explain its reaction when Matarael looked at Rei. When he brought this up, his query was rather brusquely brushed off by the scientist.
从夜天使对驾驶员的观察中，实在难以得出什么具体线索，除了它对他们的兴趣异常，以及它没有发动攻击而是径自离开的方式。美里推测这可能与明日香和真嗣的特殊情况有关，这一情况也让他们的平民朋友感到困惑，但对真嗣来说，这并不能解释夜天使在注视绫波时所表现出的反应。当他提出这一点时，科学家们却相当粗鲁地驳回了他的疑问。

"I suppose that's all we'll be able to get out of this debriefing," Misato finally announced, to groans of relief from Asuka and Toji.
"我想这次简报我们也就只能了解到这些了，"美里最终宣布，换来了明日香和东治如释重负的叹息。

Doctor Akagi nodded. "With no power during the attack, we have far less data on Matarael than I like. Nothing we can do about that, though," she remarked with a despairing sigh. "Anyway, there's one last thing I'd like to speak to you all about."
赤木博士点头道："在袭击期间没有电力，我们对夜天使的了解远少于我所期望的。不过，对此我们也无能为力，"她带着绝望的叹息说道。"总之，还有最后一件事我想和大家谈谈。"

Asuka paused in the act of getting out of her chair. "What now?" she asked in an impatient tone.
明日香正要从椅子上起身，闻言停了下来，不耐烦地问道："现在又是什么事？"

"Well, I'd just like to thank you for something," Doctor Akagi remarked. "We were originally planning to go out and speak to them today, but you've brought the Fourth Child directly to us instead."
嗯，我只是想感谢你一件事，"赤木博士说道。"我们原本计划今天出去找他们谈话，但你却直接把第四适格者带到了我们面前。

"The what?!" Asuka and Shinji shouted in sync.
"第四适格者？！"明日香和真嗣异口同声地喊道。

"Fourth Child?!" Hikari, Toji and Kensuke were far less synchronised, but their exclamations still ran over each other. All the teenagers, bar Rei, stared at each other in disbelief. Well, mostly in disbelief. Kensuke was looking between Toji and Hikari, a big grin on his face and his hands jerkily alternating between pointing at one of them or at himself.
"第四适格者？！"伊卡里、东治和健介的反应虽不如前者同步，但他们的惊呼声还是交织在一起。除了零之外，所有青少年都难以置信地互相对视着。嗯，大部分是难以置信。健介在东治和伊卡里之间来回打量，脸上挂着大大的笑容，双手不停地在两人和自己之间指来指去。

"With Shinji and Asuka's situation," Doctor Akagi loudly said, bringing everybody's attention back to her, before she continued in a calmer voice. "We had a need to find the Fourth Child ahead of schedule."
鉴于真嗣和明日香的情况，"赤木博士大声说道，将所有人的注意力重新吸引到她身上，然后她用更平静的语气继续说，"我们需要提前找到第四适格者。

"But... who is the Fourth Child?" Shinji asked, eyes darting between his friends. While piloting an Evangelion was certainly a... unique experience, he didn't exactly want to wish such a risky occupation on anybody.
"但是...第四适格者是谁呢？" 碇真嗣问道，目光在朋友们之间游移。虽然驾驶 EVA 确实是一种...独特的体验，但他并不希望任何人承担如此高风险的任务。

"Oh, how silly of me," Doctor Akagi chuckled, adjusting her glasses. "I've completely forgotten to say which one of your friends it is."
哎呀，我真是糊涂了，" 赤木博士轻笑一声，调整了一下眼镜。"我竟然忘了告诉你们是你们中的哪一位朋友。

"Well don't leave us in suspense!" exclaimed Asuka. "Just tell us already!"
那就别吊我们胃口了！" 明日香大声说道。"快点告诉我们吧！

"Alright, alright." Doctor Akagi took a piece of paper out of her pocket and unfolded it. She cleared her throat. "The Fourth Child is..."
好了，好了。" 赤木博士从口袋里掏出一张纸，展开来。她清了清嗓子。"第四适格者是...

### Chapter 22 Such An Altruist

"Well don't leave us in suspense!" exclaimed Asuka. "Just tell us already!"
那就别吊我们胃口了！" 明日香大声说道。"快点告诉我们吧！

"Alright, alright." Doctor Akagi took a piece of paper out of her pocket and unfolded it. She cleared her throat. "The Fourth Child is..."
好了，好了。" 赤木医生从口袋里掏出一张纸，展开来，清了清嗓子。"第四适格者是……

The dramatic pause had to be deliberate, Shinji decided. He was sure that there would have been a drum roll if Doctor Akagi had thought of it ahead of time, especially with the way she was glancing at everybody else in the room.
这个戏剧性的停顿肯定是故意的，真嗣断定。他确信，如果赤木医生事先想到的话，肯定会配上鼓声，尤其是她用那种眼神扫视房间里的每个人。

"Kensuke Aida!" 相田剑介！

The sudden announcement jolted Shinji out of his idle musing, and then his brain registered what his ears had heard.
突如其来的宣布让真嗣从漫不经心的沉思中惊醒，随后他的大脑才反应过来耳朵所听到的内容。

"...Me?" said the newly christened Fourth Child, both hands wavering as they pointed at himself.
"...我？"新晋的第四适格者说道，双手犹豫地指向自己。

"Him?!" Asuka practically shouted.
"他？！"明日香几乎是喊了出来。

"You," Doctor Akagi said with finality, her eyes focused on Kensuke. "The Marduk Institute has determined that you are the Fourth Child."
你，"赤木博士以不容置疑的口吻说道，目光紧盯着洞木光。"玛尔杜克机关已经确定，你就是第四适格者。

His eyes wide in amazement, Kensuke was frozen to his seat, even as Toji clapped him heavily on the back and offered his congratulations. While Hikari offered her own positive words, her eyes betrayed the concern she must have been feeling.
洞木光惊讶得目瞪口呆，坐在座位上一动不动，即便东治重重地拍了拍他的背并表示祝贺。而光虽然也说了些鼓励的话，但她的眼神却流露出内心的担忧。

"However, thanks to this latest attack we don't have the time to sort you out just yet," Doctor Akagi continued. "We'll be in touch with you in a few days to hash out the details." With that said, she put the paper back in her pocket, nodded a farewell, and exited the room.
"不过，多亏了这次最新的袭击，我们暂时还没时间处理你们的事，"赤木博士继续说道，"过几天我们会联系你，详细讨论细节。"说完，她把纸张放回口袋，点头告别，离开了房间。

"Well, I suppose that'll give you time for it to sink in!" Misato remarked, momentarily standing behind a still stunned Kensuke. "I'd love to stay for the party, but there's gonna be a ton of paperwork for me to go through. Asuka, don't bother making dinner for me, I'll be here a while." She sighed heavily as she left the room.
"嗯，我想这会给你时间好好消化一下！" 惣流评论道，暂时站在仍处于震惊中的洞木光身后。"我很想留下来参加派对，但有一大堆文件等着我去处理。明日香，不用麻烦给我准备晚餐了，我会在这里待很久。"她重重地叹了口气，离开了房间。

"I'm... I get to be a pilot..." the boy dazedly mumbled. His head slowly turned to one side, where Toji gave him an encouraging grin, then to the other side, where Hikari's smile was somewhat brittle. He then looked across the table at the three pilots he'd soon be joining. Asuka had her arms crossed, shaking her head in disbelief, while Rei seemed to be taking the news in stride.
"我... 我要成为驾驶员了..." 男孩恍惚地喃喃自语。他的头缓缓转向一边，看到东治鼓励的笑容，再转向另一边，那里光的眼神有些脆弱。然后他看向桌子对面，那三位他即将加入的驾驶员。明日香双臂交叉，难以置信地摇头，而绫波则似乎对这消息泰然处之。

"...Congratulations," said Shinji, before mentally cursing himself for hesitating. The fact that the newest pilot was going to be one of his friends didn't quite sit right with him. But the Marduk Institute, whatever that was, had made its choice. He just hoped he, and Kensuke, didn't live to regret it.
"...恭喜你," 真嗣说道，内心却暗自咒骂自己的犹豫。新驾驶员竟是他的朋友之一，这让他感觉有些不对劲。但那个所谓的马杜克机构已经做出了选择。他只希望自己和健介将来不会为此后悔。

"T-thanks, Shinji," Kensuke replied. "I just... I'm... well..." He took a few quick short breaths, then tilted his head back and let loose an ear piercing whoop of joy.
"谢...谢谢，真嗣，" 健介回答道。"我只是...我...嗯..." 他急促地吸了几口气，然后仰起头，发出了一声震耳欲聋的欢呼。

"Ugh." Asuka let her hands drop from where she had hastily clapped them over her ears. "Are you done, or do you want to deafen us some more?"
呃。" 明日香把手从匆忙捂住的耳朵上放下。"你喊完了吗，还是想让我们再聋一点？

Rubbing the back of his head, Kensuke gave a nervous chuckle. "Yeah, um... sorry. Just had to let it out, you know?"
健介揉着后脑勺，尴尬地笑了笑。"嗯，那个...对不起。就是得发泄一下，你懂的吧？"

Asuka huffed and rolled her eyes. "Yeah, well... I'll admit that I was excited too when I found out, but then... I..." She blinked, eyes going distant and unfocused, then snapped her mouth shut. "Never mind. Forget I said anything."
明日香哼了一声，翻了个白眼。“好吧，我承认刚知道的时候我也很兴奋，但是后来...我...”她眨了眨眼，眼神变得遥远而迷茫，随即紧闭双唇。“算了，当我什么都没说。”

Without another word, she got up out of her seat and stormed out of the room, yanking the door open fast enough to make it bounce off the wall and almost hit her on the way out.
她没有再多说一个字，从座位上站起来，怒气冲冲地走出房间，猛地拉开门的力道大到让门撞到墙上又反弹回来，差点在她出去时打到她。

The room was filled with awkward silence as the door clicked shut, its remaining occupants looking at each other in confusion.
随着门咔哒一声关上，房间里陷入了尴尬的沉默，剩下的人面面相觑，一脸困惑。

"I... take it none of you know what that was about?" Toji finally asked, when the silence seemed about to crush them. Everybody else shook their head or made negative sounds.
“我...猜你们都不知道这是怎么回事吧？”当沉默几乎要将他们压垮时，东治终于开口问道。其他人要么摇头，要么发出否定的声音。

"...I'll go see if she's alright," Shinji murmured, before standing and heading for the door.
"...我去看看她怎么样了," 真嗣低声说道，随后站起身朝门口走去。

"It was nice knowin' ya," Toji called out, which was immediately followed by a slapping sound and a yelp of pain.
"认识你真好," 东治喊道，紧接着是一声拍打和痛苦的叫声。

Out in the corridor, Shinji just barely caught the sight of Asuka's hair as the girl rounded a corner. He jogged to catch up, turning the corner where he had to come to a stop in a hurry. It was that or run right over Asuka, who didn't seem to notice; she had her head down with a hand on her face as she leaned against a wall. Shinji proceeded to eloquently begin the conversation.
在走廊里，真嗣刚巧瞥见明日香的发丝，女孩正拐过转角。他小跑着追上去，在转角处急忙停下，否则就要撞上明日香了，她似乎并未察觉；她低着头，一手捂着脸，靠在墙上。真嗣开始笨拙地开启对话。

"Um..." 呃...

Asuka's head shot up, causing Shinji to jolt back slightly as she clenched the hand that had been on her face into a fist. Upon recognising who had just disturbed her, she settled back down again, folding her arms in front of her chest. "What do you want?" she growled.
明日香猛地抬头，让真嗣不由得微微后仰，她紧握着原本贴在脸上的手，攥成了拳头。认出打扰她的人后，她又重新坐稳，双臂交叉在胸前。“你想干嘛？”她咆哮道。

Raising his hands in a placating gesture, Shinji replied, "I just... wanted to make sure you're alright. You kind of... disappeared in a hurry."
真嗣举起双手，做出安抚的姿态，回答说：“我只是……想确认你没事。你刚才……急匆匆地就走了。”

"I'm fine," she gruffly retorted, turning her head away from him.
“我没事，”她粗声粗气地反驳，扭头不看他。

Shinji recalled how he had essentially blown Asuka off earlier in the day in a similar manner, and a sly thought occurred. "Gee, sorry for being concerned," he said, mirroring the prior incident.
真嗣回想起那天早些时候，他也是这样对明日香置之不理，一个狡黠的念头闪过。“哎呀，关心你还真是抱歉了，”他说，模仿着之前的情景。

Asuka's head slowly turned back to him, her eyes wide in surprise. She blinked several times, as if unable to believe her eyes. Finally, her hands dropped to her side as she gave a small chuckle. "Smart ass."
明日香的头缓缓转回他这边，眼睛因惊讶而睁得大大的。她眨了好几下眼，仿佛不敢相信自己的眼睛。最终，她的手垂到身侧，轻声笑了出来。“自作聪明的家伙。”

Shinji smiled at her improved mood. "You do seem to be a magnet for them today," he remarked, rubbing the back of his head and mentally breathing a sigh of relief that his stupid plan worked, before turning serious again. "Really, though... are you alright?"
真嗣看到她情绪好转，也微笑起来。“你今天好像特别招惹他们呢，”他边说边摸了摸后脑勺，心里暗自松了口气，庆幸自己那愚蠢的计划居然奏效了，随后又恢复了严肃。“说真的...你还好吗？”

Asuka sighed heavily. "Yeah... I'm fine. I just... remembered something, that's all."
明日香重重地叹了口气。“嗯...我没事。只是...想起了一些事情而已。”

"Something bad?" Shinji asked, inquisitively tilting his head.
“不好的事吗？”真嗣好奇地歪着头问道。

With a look of bemusement, she replied, "No, I just ran off and sat here because I left the stove on." Dropping the sarcasm, she continued. "It's... something that happened a long time ago. I don't wanna talk about it."
她带着一脸困惑回答道：“不，我只是跑出来坐在这里，因为忘了关炉子。”收起讽刺，她继续说：“那是……很久以前的事了。我不想谈这个。”

"Okay." Shinji nodded in agreement. He caught a brief look of surprise on Asuka's face, possibly at the fact that he was just going to let the matter go so easily, before he added, "But if you ever feel like telling me, I'll drop whatever I'm doing to hear you out, alright?"
“好吧。”真嗣点头表示同意。他捕捉到明日香脸上闪过的一丝惊讶，可能是对他如此轻易就放过这个话题感到意外，随后他又补充道：“但如果你哪天想告诉我，我会放下手头的一切来听你倾诉，好吗？”

"Uh... yeah," Asuka lamely replied. "Sure..."
“呃……嗯，”明日香尴尬地回应，“当然……”

"Yo, here you are!" said a voice from behind Shinji, causing them both to jump. Spinning around, he saw that Toji, Hikari and Kensuke were standing behind them.
“哟，原来你们在这儿！”身后突然传来声音，让两人都吓了一跳。转身一看，原来是东治、光和健介站在他们后面。

"We're heading home now," said Kensuke, disappointment evident on his face. "We got, uh... 'asked' to vacate the briefing room."
我们现在要回家了，" 健介说，脸上的失望显而易见。"我们被... '请' 出了简报室。

"Oh yes, thanks for reminding me, nerd!" Asuka's eyes lit up in a dangerous way. "You do realise, now that you're going to be a pilot, that you'll be serving under me? And that you'll need to be trained up to our standard?"
哦对了，多谢提醒，书呆子！" 明日香的眼睛闪烁着危险的光芒。"你该明白，既然你要成为驾驶员，那就得在我手下服役，还得接受训练达到我们的标准吧？

Kensuke gulped, his face visibly paling. Shinji briefly considered jumping in to save Kensuke with a correction about the pilot ranks, or lack thereof, but since that would involve getting between a red-haired wolf and her unsuspecting prey, he decided discretion was the better part of valour.
健介咽了口唾沫，脸色明显苍白。真嗣短暂考虑过插话纠正关于驾驶员等级的误解，但想到这无异于在红发狼和她的无辜猎物之间横插一脚，他觉得还是谨慎为上。

Asuka slapped a fist into the palm of her other hand. "You can guarantee I'm going to enjoy this!"
明日香一拳击在另一手掌心，"你可以肯定，我会很享受这个过程的！"

'Well, at least she's in a much better mood now?'
'嗯，至少她现在心情好多了吧？'

For legal and security reasons, Soryu's 'boot camp', as she began to call it, had to wait until Kensuke was fully inducted and officially employed by NERV; not to mention the fact that he had to go through basic training first just to learn how to move an Evangelion. Shinji talking about how hard Soryu had pushed him in his training didn't help matters; Kensuke didn't know whether to be glad he could wait to get put through the wringer, or anxious about how long it was taking NERV to get in touch with him after the latest Angel attack.
出于法律和安全考虑，Soryu 所谓的“训练营”，她开始这么称呼，必须等到 Kensuke 完全被接纳并正式受雇于 NERV；更不用说他得先接受基础训练，学会如何操控一台 Evangelion。Shinji 谈论 Soryu 在训练中如何严格要求他的话，并没有让情况好转；Kensuke 不知道是该庆幸自己能晚些时候才经历这些磨练，还是该对 NERV 在最近一次使徒攻击后迟迟不与他联系感到焦虑。

On the surface, Masuhiro Aida seemed proud of the fact that his son had been chosen to become an Evangelion pilot, but Kensuke could see a father's concern whenever their eyes met. When wife and mother Hitomi Aida had died in a car accident, the poor man had struggled to balance work, family and his own grief; he'd briefly sunk into a bottle before a speeding driver had almost taken Kensuke away as well.
表面上，Masuhiro Aida 似乎为儿子被选中成为 Evangelion 驾驶员而感到自豪，但每当他们的目光相遇时，Kensuke 总能看出一个父亲内心的担忧。当妻子兼母亲 Hitomi Aida 在一场车祸中去世后，这位可怜的父亲曾努力平衡工作、家庭和自己的悲痛；他曾一度沉溺于酒精，直到一个超速驾驶者差点也夺走 Kensuke 的生命。

The shock of almost losing his son so soon after his wife had convinced Masuhiro to reevaluate the direction his life was heading in. After coming to terms with the death of his spouse, he ended up getting a job as part of an engineering team in the Geofront, eventually rising to the head of that team. While he did tend to arrive home late, Masuhiro always tried to spend as much of his free time as possible with Kensuke while the boy was growing up.
在妻子去世后不久，差点失去儿子的惊吓让增广重新审视了自己的人生方向。在逐渐接受妻子的离世后，他最终在 Geofront 的工程团队中找到了一份工作，并逐步晋升为团队负责人。尽管他常常晚归，但在儿子健介成长的过程中，增广总是尽可能地利用自己的空闲时间陪伴他。

Lately though, his father apparently realised that teenagers sometimes needed time to themselves, and so Masuhiro had backed off slightly in the last couple of years. Considering his hobbies, Kensuke was rather grateful for that, as well as the computer hardware and other gadgets that his father had no qualms about spending money on.
然而最近，父亲似乎意识到青少年有时也需要独处的时间，因此在过去的几年里，增广稍微退后了一些。考虑到自己的爱好，健介对此颇为感激，还有父亲毫不吝啬为他购买的电脑硬件和其他小玩意儿。

Every day that passed with no word from NERV led to more and more nervous energy building up within Kensuke. Several times Class Rep had to bring him up on the fact that he was loudly tapping his foot, or a pen, or whatever happened to be in his hand. He would give an awkward chuckle, Soryu would scoff or roll her eyes at his impatience, and Toji would glance at him with something that almost seemed like jealousy. But that couldn't be right; Kensuke could barely get two words out of Toji whenever he was talking about NERV and the Evangelions, disparaging remarks about the people in charge notwithstanding.
随着日子一天天过去，NERV 那边音讯全无，这让健介内心的紧张情绪越积越多。好几次，班长不得不提醒他，因为他正大声地敲打着脚、笔，或是手里碰巧拿的任何东西。他会尴尬地笑笑，索龙则会嗤之以鼻或对他不耐烦地翻白眼，而东治则会带着一种近乎嫉妒的眼神瞥他一眼。但这不可能；每当健介提起 NERV 和福音战士时，东治总是不屑一顾，对那些掌权者更是如此，健介几乎从他那里套不出两句话来。

It was when Kensuke asked the pil-... other pilots about how much money being saviours of humanity got them, one sunny day on the roof of the school, when he got a rather large clue. Upon being told the monthly wage by Rei, Kensuke's eyes boggled; it was almost twice what his father earned as head engineer. Out of the corner of his eye, though, he caught a glimpse of Toji clenching a fist and hitting it against his knee, and had a revelation.
直到有一天，阳光明媚，健介在学校屋顶上向那些驾驶员……其他驾驶员询问，作为人类的救世主能赚多少钱时，他才得到了一个相当大的线索。当丽告诉他每月的薪水时，健介的眼睛瞪得老大；这几乎是他的父亲作为总工程师收入的两倍。然而，从眼角余光中，他瞥见东治紧握拳头，猛击自己的膝盖，顿时恍然大悟。

The only reason Toji had gone along with his stealth photography gig was to try and get some money to help pay for his sister's surgeries. Currently, according to Toji, his sister might never walk again due to the lack of money. And now Kensuke had himself landed a job that could have paid for that with cash to spare. Guilt crawled through his belly as Kensuke realised there wasn't much he could do about that.
唯一促使东治参与偷拍摄影的原因，是为了筹钱帮助支付妹妹的手术费。据东治所说，由于资金不足，妹妹可能永远无法行走。而如今，健介自己找到了一份工作，本可以用余钱解决这个问题。意识到自己对此无能为力的愧疚感在健介心中蔓延。

...Or perhaps there was. ...或许，还有一线希望。

When the call finally came, it was not by phone. Rather, it was the sudden presence of two black-suited men in Class 2-A that resulted in Kensuke entering the Geofront for the third time. Despite that, the fact this was the first time he was being officially invited was enough to cause his stomach to flip flop as the car trundled down the vehicle elevator.
当召唤终于到来时，并非通过电话。而是两位黑衣男子的突然出现，让健介第三次踏入第三新东京市的地下都市。尽管如此，这是他首次正式受邀，足以让他在车辆电梯缓缓下降时，胃里翻江倒海。

After all, he was about to become an Evangelion pilot.
毕竟，他即将成为一名 EVA 驾驶员。

The skyscraper-sized robots had never been far from his mind ever since he got to see Unit-01 fight that Angel with the energy whips. Getting to actually sit in it, admittedly only as a passenger, had been like a dream come true, even with the nightmarish interrogation afterwards.
自从他目睹了零号机用能量鞭与使徒激战后，那些摩天大楼般高大的机器人就从未远离过他的思绪。尽管只是作为乘客，能真正坐进零号机对他来说已是梦想成真，即便随后的审讯如同噩梦一般。

The vehicle elevator clanked to a stop, and the black sedan's engine came to life as the driver slowly rolled it onto solid ground before bringing it up to speed to continue down a tunnel that quickly opened up into the Geofront proper. Kensuke practically pressed his face up against the car window as he silently gawped at the splendour. To him, it looked like someone had simply pulled up a chunk of the surface and perfectly transplanted it a kilometre below, encased in a brilliant white sphere.
车辆电梯咔哒一声停下，黑色轿车的引擎随即启动，司机缓缓将其驶上坚实地面，随后加速驶入一条隧道，隧道很快豁然开朗，通向地底都市的中心。健介几乎将脸紧贴在车窗上，默默地凝视着眼前壮丽的景象。对他而言，这仿佛是有人将地表的一块完美地移植到了一公里深的地下，包裹在一个璀璨的白色球体之中。

All too soon, however, the vista disappeared as the journey came to an end in another tunnel. Stopping in front of a security checkpoint, Kensuke and his two escorts got out of the car, one of the men beckoning for him to follow. They advanced through the checkpoint without incident, and Kensuke proceeded to completely lose his sense of direction as he followed the escorts through many twisting and intersecting corridors.
然而，美景转瞬即逝，随着旅程在另一条隧道中结束。在安检站前停下，健介和他的两名护卫下了车，其中一人示意他跟上。他们顺利通过安检，健介跟着护卫穿过众多曲折交错的走廊，彻底迷失了方向。

Finally, Kensuke saw a familiar sight; or rather, two of them. Doctor Akagi and Captain Katsuragi were standing in the corridor outside a room, clearly waiting for him. As the agents handed Kensuke off without a word, he came to attention and delivered a somewhat awkward salute.
最终，健介看到了熟悉的身影；确切地说，是两位。赤木博士和葛城上尉正站在一个房间外的走廊上，显然是在等他。特工们一言不发地将健介交接过去，他立刻立正，略显尴尬地敬了个礼。

Doctor Akagi simply stared at him, a folder in one of her hands tapping against her leg, while Captain Katsuragi chuckled and shook her head slightly. "No need for that, Aida, you're not a subordinate just yet."
赤木博士只是盯着他，一只手拿着文件夹轻敲着腿，而葛城上尉则轻笑一声，微微摇头。“没必要这样，相田，你还不是下属呢。”

"Perhaps, but it's still a formal sign of respect, ma'am," Kensuke replied, still holding the salute.
“或许吧，但这仍是一种正式的尊敬表示，女士。”健介回答道，依旧保持着敬礼的姿势。

With an amiable smirk, the Captain relented and returned the salute, allowing him to lower his hand. She then gestured towards the door they were standing next to, indicating for him to precede them into the room.
船长带着和蔼的微笑，回了一个礼，示意他可以放下手。随后，她朝他们所站之旁的门一指，示意他先进房间。

This room looked exactly the same as the one from a few days ago, yet Kensuke was sure that he had been taken to a different area. He sat down on one side of the table, and the two women took their places opposite him. Doctor Akagi opened her folder and took some papers out of it, spreading them on the table. Kensuke caught a glimpse of his own face upside down, and attempted to surreptitiously read what was probably his profile.
这房间与几天前的那间如出一辙，但健介确信自己被带到了另一个区域。他在桌子一侧坐下，两位女士则在对面的位置落座。赤木医生打开文件夹，从中取出几页纸摊在桌上。健介瞥见自己倒置的脸庞，便试图偷偷阅读那很可能是自己档案的文件。

"Alright, you already know who I am, and let's dispense with formalities while we're here," Misato began, clasping her hands in front of her on the table. "I'm not sure you've been properly introduced to my friend, however. This is Doctor Ritsuko Akagi, NERV's chief scientist in command of its Technical Branch, which governs research and development of the Evangelions along with repair and maintenance." She paused as the scientist gave Kensuke a tilt of her head in greeting. "First of all I'd like to thank you for agreeing to become the Fourth Child. It would have been entirely within your right to refuse... but I know that you wouldn't have even thought of turning us down."
好了，你已经知道我是谁了，咱们在这里就不必拘礼了，" 葛城美里开口说道，双手在桌前交握。"不过，我想你可能还没正式认识我的朋友。这位是赤木律子博士，NERV 技术开发部的首席科学家，负责管理 EVA 的研究、开发以及维修保养工作。" 她停顿了一下，此时科学家向洞木光点头致意。"首先，我要感谢你同意成为第四适格者。你有权拒绝... 但我知道你根本不会考虑拒绝我们。

Doctor Akagi nodded. "Indeed. We are in dire need of an extra pilot as this war against the Angels continues, and the Marduk Institute delivered you to us just in time."
赤木律子博士点头道："确实如此。随着与使徒的战争持续，我们急需额外的驾驶员，而马杜克机关正好及时将你推荐给了我们。"

Blinking in puzzlement, Kensuke asked, "What's the Marduk Institute? I've never heard of it."
洞木光眨了眨眼，困惑地问："马杜克机关是什么？我从没听说过。"

"It's a committee that has been screening the global population for suitable Evangelion pilots," the scientist replied. "I haven't been told what the criteria are, besides that it must be a child born after Second Impact."
那是一个委员会，一直在全球范围内筛选适合驾驶 EVA 的候选人，" 科学家回答道，"至于具体的选拔标准，除了必须是第二次冲击后出生的孩子外，我并不清楚。

Kensuke leaned back in his chair slightly, raising an eyebrow. "That's... odd," he quipped.
健介微微后仰，靠在椅背上，挑起一边眉毛。“这还真是……奇怪，”他打趣道。

"Confusing, yes, but that's not a discussion for today," said Misato, her eyes quickly darting to her co-worker and back to him. "We're here to go over the details of your employment with us as well as give you an induction."
“的确让人困惑，不过这不是今天讨论的话题，”美里说，她的目光迅速扫过同事，又回到他身上。“我们今天来是要和你详细谈谈你的雇佣事宜，并给你做个入职介绍。”

"First off," said Doctor Akagi as she slid the piece of paper with his face on it towards him. "Please confirm that everything here is accurate."
“首先，”赤木博士边说边将一张印有他头像的纸推到他面前，“请确认这里的信息是否准确无误。”

Kensuke's eyes just about bulged out of his head at the profile. It was scrupulously exact, down to his current height and weight; likely taken from a recent annual health check performed by the school. He looked up at the women and nodded in the affirmative.
健介看到自己的档案，眼睛几乎要瞪出来了。资料详尽至极，连他目前的身高体重都一清二楚；很可能是从学校最近一次年度体检中获取的。他抬头看向两位女士，肯定地点了点头。

"Good." The scientist pulled the profile back towards her, replacing it with another piece of paper. "This one is a non-disclosure agreement, stating that you will not discuss any sensitive NERV information with unauthorised persons."
好的。" 科学家将档案拉回自己面前，换上了另一张纸。"这是一份保密协议，声明你不得与未经授权的人士讨论任何敏感的 NERV 信息。

"Understandable," said Kensuke as he signed it. "Awesome as they are, you wouldn't want someone shady getting their hands on Eva or weapon blueprints."
可以理解，" 健介说着签下了名字。"虽然那些东西很酷，但你们肯定不希望有可疑人物接触到 Eva 或武器蓝图。

"Indeed." Another piece of paper. "This one is an agreement that you give NERV permission to do whatever is necessary in the event you are hospitalised while employed by us. NERV has what is probably the world's most advanced medical facilities. If you get knocked down for any reason, I can almost guarantee that we can pick you back up again."
确实如此。" 又是一张纸。"这份协议是，如果你在我们雇佣期间住院，你授权 NERV 采取一切必要措施。NERV 拥有可能是世界上最先进的医疗设施。无论出于何种原因倒下，我几乎可以保证我们能让你重新站起来。

His eyes lighting up at this information, Kensuke eagerly gave his signature again.
听到这些信息，健介的眼睛亮了起来，他再次热切地签下了自己的名字。

One more piece of paper from the scientist. "Finally, this one is the contract stating that you will work for us as an Evangelion pilot."
科学家递来的又一张纸。"最后这份，是确认你将作为 Evangelion 驾驶员为我们工作的合同。"

Kensuke paid far more attention to this one than the others, carefully reading through it. Among other things, it stated that he was not to leave Tokyo-3 for any reason without permission from NERV, and that he would follow every reasonable order given to him by a superior officer. He appreciated the fact that it said 'reasonable order', given the vast swath of stories about people in positions of power forcing subordinates to perform unsavoury acts.
比起其他文件， Kensuke 对这份合同格外留心，逐字逐句地仔细阅读。其中规定，未经 NERV 许可，他不得因任何理由离开第三新东京市，并且必须服从上级军官下达的每一项合理命令。鉴于权力之下迫使下属执行不愉快任务的种种传闻，他很欣赏合同中提及的“合理命令”这一措辞。

The pen in his hand hovered over the spot where he was supposed to sign, its tip waggling back and forth as Kensuke marshalled his thoughts. It was highly likely that what he was about to attempt could land him in hot water, but it was something he felt had to be done.
手中的笔悬停在签名处上方，笔尖来回摆动，Kensuke 在整理思绪。他即将尝试的事情极有可能让自己陷入困境，但这是他觉得必须去做的。

"Before I sign," he said, lowering the pen. "There's a couple of things I'd like to sort out first." To his faint surprise, neither woman seemed at all concerned.
"在我签字之前，" 他放下笔说道，"有几件事我想先弄清楚。" 令他略感意外的是，两位女士似乎毫不担心。

"Let me guess," said Doctor Akagi. "You want to negotiate what we'll be paying you?"
让我猜猜，"阿卡吉医生说道，"你想谈谈我们该付你多少报酬？

"No," said Kensuke with a shake of his head. He paused, then brought his left shoulder up in a half shrug. "Well, maybe that too, but that's not the primary thing I'm after here."
不，"健介摇了摇头，停顿了一下，然后左肩微微耸起，做出半边耸肩的动作。"嗯，也许那也是一部分，但这不是我来这里的主要目的。

Now they were surprised. 这下他们感到惊讶了。

"Oh?" Misato quirked an eyebrow. "You believe you can get more out of NERV than a wage most school kids could only dream of? You'd already be getting more than I earn, due to the high risk of your job."
哦？"美里挑了挑眉毛，"你认为你能从 NERV 那里得到比普通学生梦寐以求的薪水还要多的东西？你的工作风险很高，拿的已经比我挣的还要多了。

"I know," replied Kensuke, "but that's not what I want most from NERV. No..." He set the pen down on the table and brought his hands together, one cupping the other in front of his face. He took a deep breath. "What I want from you is accountability for your actions."
我明白，" 健介回答道，"但这并不是我最想从 NERV 得到的。不……" 他放下笔，双手合十，一只手托着另一只，置于脸前。他深吸了一口气。"我想要的是你们对自己行为的负责。

Misato and Doctor Akagi glanced at each other, confusion rife on their faces. "What do you mean?" Misato asked as they turned their attention back to him.
美里和赤木博士互望一眼，脸上满是困惑。"你指的是什么？" 美里问道，他们再次将注意力转向他。

Kensuke lowered his hands down to the table. "A few months ago, my friend's sister was badly injured when the building she was in partially collapsed."
健介将双手放回桌上。"几个月前，我朋友的妹妹在一栋建筑部分倒塌时受了重伤。"

Doctor Akagi frowned. "That's awful, and I am sympathetic, but I fail to see what that has to do with us."
赤木博士皱起眉头。"那真是太糟糕了，我对此表示同情，但我看不出这与我们有什么关系。"

Narrowing his eyes, Kensuke pressed on. "Hisae Suzuhara was injured during the Third Angel's attack because NERV dragged its feet about bringing in a new pilot and ensuring they were adequately trained to defend the city."
眯起眼睛，健介继续追问：“他的爱苏羽原在第三次使徒袭击中受伤，是因为 NERV 迟迟不引进新驾驶员，并确保他们得到充分训练以保卫城市。”

Misato's eyes widened, her expression quickly turning to a scowl as she glanced at Doctor Akagi. "Yes, you brought Shinji in literally at the last minute. Unit-01 fell over as soon as he got to the surface because we didn't have time to give him proper instruction."
美里瞪大了眼睛，表情迅速转为怒容，她瞥了一眼赤木博士。“没错，你几乎是最后一刻才把真嗣带来。他一到达地面，零号机就倒下了，因为我们没时间给他适当的指导。”

Kensuke gestured with one hand at the Captain. "Exactly. I've been told that Ayanami had been injured well before that attack. You should have sent for Ikari immediately so that he could take her place, even if it would have only been temporary."
健介用手势向船长示意。“正是如此。我听说绫波在那个攻击之前就已经受了重伤。你们本应立即召唤碇，让他暂时接替她的位置。”

"I'm the chief scientist, not a Human Resources manager," Doctor Akagi said in rebuttal. "I don't know why that happened either. And I don't know what you expect us to do about it now."
“我是首席科学家，不是人力资源经理，”赤木博士反驳道，“我也不清楚为什么会发生那种事。而且我不知道你现在期望我们对此做些什么。”

"I want you to take responsibility!" Kensuke hotly retorted, just barely refraining from slamming a hand on the table. "You just told me that NERV has the best hospital in the world. If you want me to pilot, then NERV has to make up for their mistake by doing whatever is necessary to let my friend's sister walk again!"
我要你负责！" 健介激烈地反驳道，差点没忍住一掌拍在桌上。"你刚告诉我 NERV 拥有世界上最好的医院。如果你们要我驾驶，那么 NERV 就必须弥补他们的过失，尽一切可能让我的朋友的妹妹重新站起来！

In the face of his anger, both women blinked at him for a few seconds. Finally, Doctor Akagi sighed and rubbed her forehead. "Such an altruist. Why not just take the money we give you and pay for the surgery yourself?"
面对他的怒火，两位女士愣了几秒钟。最终，赤木博士叹了口气，揉了揉额头。"真是个利他主义者。为什么不直接拿我们给你的钱，自己去支付手术费用呢？"

"Again. Best hospital in the world," Kensuke repeated. "The general hospital in the city wouldn't be nearly as well-funded. And just throwing money at a problem isn't taking responsibility." He leaned back in his seat and folded his arms. "Either NERV agrees to heal her or I walk."
再说一遍，世界上最好的医院，" 健介重复道。"市里的普通医院可没有这么充足的经费。光是砸钱解决问题，那不叫负责。" 他靠回椅背，双臂交叉。"要么 NERV 同意治好她，要么我就走人。

Misato stifled an amused snort. "Bold words, kiddo. We could just drop you and find someone else."
美里忍住一声轻笑。"口气不小啊，小子。我们大可以放弃你，另找他人。"

Kensuke smirked and shook his head. "How much time passed between this Marduk thing finding the Third Child and me? If you're in such a dire need as you said before, can NERV afford to wait? I'm not asking for the impossible, I just want you to help somebody get better."
剑介嘴角一挑，摇了摇头。“这个所谓的马杜克机构找到第三适格者和我之间，究竟隔了多久？如果真如你之前所说那般紧急，NERV 等得起吗？我并非要求不可能之事，只是希望你们能帮助某人康复。”

Doctor Akagi rolled her eyes and blew air past pursed lips. "...Very well," she soon said. "I'll get in touch with the general hospital and see about moving this girl to our medical facility. Happy? Would you like to try and squeeze anything else out of us while you believe you have us over a barrel?"
赤木博士翻了个白眼，紧闭的嘴唇间吹出一口气。“……好吧，”她不久后说道，“我会联系总医院，看看能否将这位女孩转至我们的医疗设施。满意了吗？趁你现在觉得我们处于下风，还想从我们这里榨取些什么吗？”

"Nah, I got what I wanted," Kensuke replied, giving a sigh of relief in the privacy of his own head. "Well... I wouldn't mind being able to get a university scholarship when all this is over."
“不，我已得到我想要的，”剑介回答道，内心暗自松了口气。“嗯……如果这一切结束后能获得大学奖学金，我倒也不介意。”

Misato nodded. "That's certainly something we can manage, right?" she asked, looking at Doctor Akagi. "Maybe for all the pilots?" she meaningfully added.
美里点头道：“那应该是我们能办到的，对吧？”她看向赤木博士，询问道。“或许可以为所有驾驶员都争取一下？”她意味深长地补充。

The scientist returned the nod. "Of course. We won't just dump you back on the street when the war is over. NERV will put in a good word for whatever educational institution you and the others choose."
科学家点头回应：“当然。战争结束后，我们不会让你流落街头。NERV 会为你和其他人选择的任何教育机构说好话。”

"Then I'm all set!" Kensuke enthusiastically replied, picking the pen back up and signing his name.
“那我就放心了！” 健介热情地回答，重新拿起笔签下了自己的名字。

"Brilliant!" Misato got up out of her chair and gave him an encouraging smile. "Welcome to NERV, Pilot Aida! Just the induction left to go, and then we'll see you tomorrow for your first simulator training session."
“太好了！” 美里从椅子上站起来，给了他一个鼓励的微笑。“欢迎加入 NERV，相田飞行员！只剩下入队仪式了，然后我们明天见，你将进行第一次模拟训练。”

Kensuke grinned, before realisation struck. "Oh damn," he muttered as his face fell. "Soryu's boot camp..."
健介咧嘴一笑，随即意识到什么，脸色一沉。“哦，糟糕，”他喃喃自语，“明日香的训练营……”

"Sorry, can't help you there!" Misato replied with a shrug. "Sure we've got our own basic training you'll need to go through first, but Pilot Soryu's done such a great job of helping Ikari and Ayanami that we've decided to let her handle the majority of pilot training."
抱歉，这事儿我帮不上忙！" 葛城美里耸耸肩回答道，"当然，你得先接受我们自己的基础训练，但因为明日香已经做得很好，帮助了碇和绫波，所以我们决定让她来负责大部分的驾驶员训练。

Doctor Akagi smirked humourlessly. "If you had thought of that beforehand, you could have stipulated that we protect you from her ministrations." She gathered the paperwork back into her folder. "Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do now. I'm off to process this paperwork; Misato will give you the tour. Farewell for now, Pilot Aida."
赤木律子博士冷笑一声，"如果你早想到这一点，本可以要求我们保护你免受她的'照顾'。" 她将文件重新整理进文件夹，"可惜现在无能为力了。我要去处理这些文件了；葛城会带你参观。暂时再见了，相田剑介。"

As she left the room, Kensuke's head dropped onto the table. "Will I even live to see the next Angel Attack?" he mumbled, to which Misato simply laughed.
当她离开房间时，相田剑介的头重重地砸在桌面上。"我还能活着见到下一个使徒来袭吗？" 他喃喃自语，对此葛城美里只是笑了笑。

NERV Headquarters was, in a word, labyrinthine. Just one glance at a wall map told Kensuke that he'd be getting lost quite a bit, and he resolved to try and wander its halls only with somebody else. Captain Katsuragi made sure to show him the most critical areas first, i.e. the changing room and the path to the Evangelion cages. However, since it was only the start of the tour, he didn't get to admire the gargantuan machines just yet.
特务机关 NERV 总部，简而言之，就是个迷宫。仅凭一眼墙上的地图，相田剑介就明白自己将会迷路无数次，他决心只在有人陪同的情况下才探索这些走廊。葛城上尉首先确保带他参观了最关键的区域，即更衣室和通往 EVA 机库的路径。然而，由于这只是参观的开始，他还未能一睹那些巨型机器的风采。

Other stops included the command centre, the simulators, the medical wing, the main exit back to the surface, and finally the cafeteria, where they sat down and got something to eat. Between mouthfuls of food, Captain Katsuragi spoke of what he was to do in an emergency, which mostly boiled down to 'get to the Geofront, get changed and get to the cages'. Kensuke was somewhat unnerved by the news that a Section Two detachment would be following him wherever he went in the city, but at least they were going to be discreet about it; he hardly ever saw the agents assigned to the other pilots.
其他参观点包括指挥中心、模拟器室、医疗翼、返回地面的主出口，最后是食堂，他们在那里坐下用餐。在咀嚼食物的间隙，葛城上尉谈及紧急情况下他应采取的行动，基本上可以概括为“抵达第三新东京市，更换装备并进入驾驶舱”。得知第二分队将在城市中随时跟随自己，真嗣感到有些不安，但至少他们会保持低调；他几乎从未见过分配给其他驾驶员的特工。

Soon after their meal was finished, Kensuke received the news he had been waiting for: finally, NERV was going to let him sit in an Evangelion. First would be a simple test to see which robot he could work best with, then basic training, then...
用餐结束后不久，真嗣终于等到了期盼已久的消息：NERV 终于允许他进入 EVA 驾驶舱。首先将进行一项简单的测试，以确定他与哪台机器人配合最佳，随后是基础训练，再然后...

Kensuke shivered slightly as memory caught up with him. After basic training, he'd be thrown to the wolves. More specifically, a wolf with red hair that was quite possibly still holding a grudge against him. Forget the nasty drill sergeant cliché, this would be a spiteful drill sergeant. Who also happened to be in a skyscraper-sized robot.
回忆涌上心头，真嗣不禁微微颤抖。基础训练之后，他将被投入实战。更确切地说，是面对一个红发狼人，对方很可能还对他怀恨在心。这可不是什么刻薄的教官老套剧情，而是一个充满恶意的教官。而且这位教官还操控着一架摩天大楼般大小的机器人。

Upon reaching the changing room, Kensuke was only mildly surprised to already find a locker with 'Fourth Child Kensuke Aida' stamped on a metal plate and affixed to its door. He stared at the title for a moment, reminding himself that even though Soryu would likely drag him through hell, it was so that he could be an effective Evangelion pilot. Being able to defend humanity against alien invaders would be worth that and more. He took a deep breath and opened the door.
抵达更衣室时，发现一个储物柜上已经贴着刻有“第四适格者 相田剑介”字样的金属牌，这让剑介只是略感惊讶。他凝视着这个头衔片刻，提醒自己，尽管明日香可能会把他拖入地狱般的训练，但这一切都是为了让他成为一名出色的 Evangelion 驾驶员。能够保卫人类免受外星入侵者的威胁，这一切的付出都是值得的。他深吸一口气，打开了柜门。

"...Really?" he muttered, staring at the garish yellow plugsuit. "Would have preferred something in camo colours..."
“...真的假的？”他喃喃自语，盯着那件刺眼的黄色插入栓服。“要是迷彩色的就好了...”

With a groaning sigh, he unwrapped the plugsuit and unfurled it in front of him. A folded up piece of paper flopped out and landed on the floor, and he bent down to pick it up. It was a set of instructions for how to put the plugsuit on, presumably added to the package because it was his first time.
他叹了口气，拆开插入栓服的包装，将其展开在面前。一张折叠的纸随之掉落在地，他弯腰捡起。这是一份穿戴说明，显然是因为他初次使用而附在包裹里的。

"'All clothing must be removed before'... Oh geeze." Kensuke looked around the changing room, specifically at the upper corners. As far as he could see, there were no security cameras in here, but that didn't prove their lack of existence. Fortunately there was a screen nearby; even though he was alone in the room, and it was unlikely that anybody on NERV's security team was a pervert, he chose to go behind it to disrobe.
"'所有衣物必须在之前脱掉'...哎呀。" 健介环顾更衣室，特别是上角。就他所见，这里没有监控摄像头，但这并不能证明它们不存在。幸运的是，附近有一个屏风；尽管房间里只有他一个人，而且 NERV 安保团队中不太可能有变态，他还是选择走到屏风后面脱衣服。

Half of the instructions seemed to be written for somebody who had never worn clothes before, telling Kensuke precisely how to step into the plugsuit and pull it up his body. He did so, quickly noting how the rubber suit hung off his body in a manner entirely unlike how he'd seen Soryu and Ikari wear their plugsuits. The next line of instructions solved the issue by pointing out the panel on the underside of the left wrist. An exploratory press of the largest button there rapidly evacuated the suit, giving him a strange sensation as air rushed out of its neck when the suit conformed to his body.
一半的说明似乎是为从未穿过衣服的人写的，详细告诉健介如何穿上插入栓服并拉上身体。他照做了，很快就注意到橡胶服挂在他身上的方式与他见过的苏利和碇穿的插入栓服完全不同。下一条说明通过指出左手腕下方的面板解决了这个问题。他试探性地按下那里最大的按钮，迅速排空了服装，当服装贴合他的身体时，空气从颈部冲出，给他带来了一种奇怪的感觉。

Feeling just how tight it was, Kensuke nervously glanced down at his body. To his great relief, the designers of the plugsuit had clearly thought of everything; a discreet chunk of rubber over the groin region handily protected his modesty.
感受到紧绷的束缚，健介紧张地低头审视自己的身体。令他大为宽慰的是，插件服的设计师显然考虑周全；私密部位上方巧妙覆盖的一块橡胶，恰到好处地维护了他的体面。

There was a knock at the door, and an unfamiliar woman's voice said, "Are you decent, Pilot Aida? We're ready to begin."
门外传来敲击声，一个陌生女声说道：“您准备好了吗，相田飞行员？我们即将开始。”

Suppressing a grin at the title, Kensuke called back, "Yeah, I'll be out in a sec!" Just as he was about to stuff his clothes into the locker he had taken the plugsuit from, he saw a pair of yellow plastic ovoids. It took him a moment to realise that these were his version of those hair clip things he had seen Soryu wearing. Assuming they were somehow part of the uniform, he grabbed them out of the locker as he put his glasses back on, then headed for the door.
听到这个称呼，健介忍住笑意，回应道：“好了，我马上出来！”正当他准备将自己的衣物塞进存放插件服的柜子时，他注意到一对黄色的塑料椭圆形物品。他愣了一下才意识到，这正是他那款类似于曾经见过的惣流所佩戴的发夹。既然它们似乎是制服的一部分，他便从柜中取出，戴上眼镜，随即向门口走去。

Outside the changing room, there was a young woman who Kensuke almost thought was related to Shinji. They both had very similar hair, even to the point of it being the same shade of brown, and the woman had the same slightly nervous look that seemed to be a semi-permanent fixture on his friend's face.
更衣室外，站着一位年轻女子，健介差点以为她和真嗣有血缘关系。两人的发型极为相似，连发色都是同一种棕褐，而且这位女士脸上带着与好友真嗣如出一辙的略显紧张的神情，仿佛成了半永久的表情。

"Hello, Pilot Aida, I am Lieutenant Ibuki," she said, giving a small bow. "Captain Katsuragi is briefing the other pilots, so I am here to escort you to the cages."
你好，飞行员艾达，我是伊吹二尉，"她微微鞠躬说道，"葛城上尉正在向其他飞行员做简报，所以我来带你去机库。

"Other pilots?" Kensuke echoed. "They're here already?"
其他飞行员？"健介重复道，"他们已经到了吗？

"Of course," Lieutenant Ibuki replied with a nod. "It's simply a precaution, but one of them will be on standby in their Eva in case of an emergency."
当然，"伊吹二尉点头回答，"这只是预防措施，但其中一位会待命在他们的 Eva 里，以防万一。

Kensuke frowning, tilting his head slightly. "Emergency? They're robots aren't they? Can't you just pull the plug?"
健介皱着眉，微微侧头，"紧急情况？它们不是机器人吗？你们不能直接切断电源吗？"

With a shake of her head, Lieutenant Ibuki started walking, and he hurried to catch up. "I don't believe you are cleared to know yet, so I will just say again that it's a precaution."
伊吹二尉摇了摇头，开始向前走去，他急忙跟上。“我不认为你现在有权知道，所以我再说一遍，这只是一种预防措施。”

Blinking in puzzlement, Kensuke decided to remain silent for the time being.
健介困惑地眨了眨眼，决定暂时保持沉默。

"Hey thanks, nerd, I didn't need my eyes anyway."
“嘿，谢了，书呆子，反正我也不需要我的眼睛。”

Kensuke took Soryu's deadpan greeting with a smirk as he stepped through the door into the Evangelion cages, where a giant purple head loomed over them all. "Says the girl who goes around wearing bright red."
健介带着一丝笑意接受了 Soryu 的平淡问候，他穿过门进入 EVA 的笼子，那里一个巨大的紫色头部在他们上方隐约可见。“说得好像那个到处穿着鲜红色的女孩似的。”

Soryu snorted. "Perhaps, but now the pilot corps is just one green plugsuit away from looking like a traffic light themed posse."
真嗣哼了一声。“也许吧，但现在驾驶员队伍只差一件绿色插入栓服，就能变成交通灯主题的团队了。”

"That is not strictly necessary," came Ayanami's soft voice. "The 'go' signal for traffic lights in Japan is a blue light, although it gets called 'green' in keeping with international law regarding traffic lights. Pilot Ikari would only need a slight adjustment in the colour of his plugsuit to create your 'posse'." As she went on, the other teenagers slowly turned their heads to stare wide-eyed at her. It took until she finished speaking before she noticed, whereupon she flinched slightly at their rapt attention. "Is... there a problem?"
“这倒不是绝对必要的，”绫波的声音柔和地传来。“在日本，交通灯的‘通行’信号其实是蓝光，只是为了与国际交通灯法规保持一致，才被称为‘绿色’。碇驾驶员只需稍微调整一下插入栓服的颜色，就能组成你所说的‘团队’。”她继续说着，其他少年们渐渐转过头来，睁大眼睛盯着她。直到她说完，她才注意到他们的全神贯注，不由得微微一颤。“有……什么问题吗？”

"No no, nothing at all," Soryu immediately replied, rapidly waving her hands in front of her. "We just... weren't expecting to hear you say something like that, Wondergirl."
“不不，完全没问题，”真嗣立刻回答，双手在面前快速挥动。“我们只是……没想到你会说出这样的话，奇迹少女。”

"...I do not see why that is irregular," Ayanami stiffly replied.
“……我不明白这有什么不寻常的，”绫波生硬地回应。

Shinji seemed about to say something, but Captain Katsuragi's voice cut him off as she spoke over the intercom. "Chat time's over, kids, head to your Evas. Aida, stay where you are, we'll be trying you in Unit-01 first."
真嗣似乎正要说些什么，但葛城美里队长的声音通过内部通讯打断了他。"闲聊时间结束，孩子们，去你们的 Eva 那里。相田，你就留在原地，我们先让你试试零号机。"

Shinji, Soryu and Ayanami moved off towards the other cages, leaving Kensuke standing in front of the purple behemoth that had rescued him and Toji during the Fourth Angel's attack. Knowing that he was soon about to go through hell at the hands of Soryu did nothing to quell the excitement coursing through his body. He rubbed his hands together in glee and gave a low whistle.
真嗣、明日香和绫波向其他机库走去，留下剑介站在那台紫色的巨人面前，这巨人曾在第四使徒袭击时救过他和东治。尽管知道很快就要在明日香手下经历一番磨难，但体内的兴奋感丝毫未减。他搓着手，喜形于色，吹了一声低低的口哨。

"Oh, this is going to be fun!"
哦，这一定会很有趣！

### Chapter 23 Asuka's Boot Camp

Misato folded her arms as she leaned back in her chair. The holoscreen in front of the bridge crew showed the inside of Unit-01's entry plug, where the new pilot was sitting and waiting. When Aida adjusted his glasses, a thought came to her mind and she gave voice to it, keying the comm system. "Hey kid, are those glasses waterproof?"
美里双臂交叉，靠在椅背上。舰桥前的全息屏幕显示着零号机插入栓内部的画面，新驾驶员正坐在那里等待。当相田推了推眼镜时，她脑海中闪过一个念头，随即通过通讯系统发声：“喂，小子，你那眼镜防水吗？”

"Huh?" Aida's eyes darted around until he saw the comm screen. "Uh, no. That's probably gonna be a problem eventually, with... whatever liquid you put in these tubes, right?. I'll have to see about getting a new pair."
“啊？”相田的目光四处游移，直到看见通讯屏幕。“呃，不防水。这迟早会是个问题，因为……你们往这些管子里灌的不知什么液体，对吧？我得考虑换一副了。”

Misato shook her head. "Don't worry, NERV can help you out there."
美里摇了摇头。“别担心，NERV 会帮你解决的。”

"Anything else before we begin?" Ritsuko asked. When no answer was forthcoming, she strode over to stand behind Maya's chair. "Right, let's begin the first test."
“还有其他问题吗，我们开始前？”律子问道。见无人回应，她便走到真矢的椅子后面站定。“好，那我们开始第一次测试。”

The three technicians began tapping at their keyboards and calling out the usual things that always went over Misato's head. Since nobody was shouting, however, she knew that everything was fine so far. After closing the comm link, she interlaced her fingers behind her as a headrest, and looked over at Ritsuko. "Hey Rits," she said. "Any guesses as to how the tests will go?"
三位技术人员开始敲击键盘，喊出那些总是让葛城美里一头雾水的常规术语。不过，既然没人尖叫，她就知道目前一切正常。关闭通讯链接后，她将手指交错置于脑后作为头枕，转头看向律子。“嘿，律子，”她说，“你觉得测试会怎么样？”

Ritsuko threw a glance over her shoulder. "Let's just say I know exactly how this first test will pan out. Unit-01 is rather... temperamental."
律子回头瞥了一眼。“这么说吧，我对这第一次测试的结果了如指掌。零号机嘛……有点儿喜怒无常。”

"You know, that's kind of a worrying descriptor for a giant walking weapon."
“你知道，用‘喜怒无常’来形容一个巨型行走武器，多少有点让人不安。”

"But it's accurate. Quite frankly I'm amazed that Asuka is able to synchronise as well as she can."
“但这是事实。坦白讲，我真惊讶明日香能与它同步得这么好。”

Misato frowned. "Our three regular pilots can sync with Unit-01 no problem. Why would this kid be any different?
美里皱起了眉头。“我们那三位常规驾驶员与零号机同步都没问题。这孩子会有什么不同呢？”

"It-" Beeping from Maya's computer interrupted Ritsuko's response, and she sighed at the screen "Just as I expected, Unit-01's rejecting the Fourth Child. We can try again, but I think it'll just be a waste of time."
“这——”玛雅的电脑发出的哔哔声打断了律子的回答，她对着屏幕叹了口气，“正如我所料，零号机正在排斥第四适格者。我们可以再试一次，但我认为这只会是浪费时间。”

"We should do it anyway, just in case," replied Misato. "Remember how Asuka's activation test went?"
“我们还是应该试试，以防万一，”美里回应道，“还记得明日香的启动测试是怎么进行的吗？”

Ritsuko stared at her for a moment before shrugging. "Fine, but I'm not holding my breath."
律子盯着她看了一会儿，然后耸了耸肩。“好吧，但我并不抱太大希望。”

XXX

Kensuke was not expecting rainbows as part of the piloting experience. The interior walls of the entry plug suddenly lit up with billions of colours swirling around, then returned to blank metal just as quickly. While he sat there in abject puzzlement, wondering if he should work out how to open a comm channel to ask about it, the kaleidoscope of colours returned, disappearing again and making Kensuke fumble around for a comm switch. Thankfully, it seemed Captain Katsuragi wanted to chat anyway, as the comm screen returned.
健介并未预料到驾驶体验中会出现彩虹。插入栓的内壁突然亮起，亿万色彩旋绕其间，随后又迅速恢复成空白金属。他坐在那里，满心困惑，思索着是否该设法打开通讯频道询问此事，这时万花筒般的色彩再次出现，又消失，让健介摸索着寻找通讯开关。幸好，似乎葛城上尉也想聊天，通讯屏幕随即恢复。

"Sorry, looks like Unit-01 isn't for you," she said with an apologetic shrug. "In a minute we're going to use the cranes to shift you to Unit-02. Quicker and easier to do that than you kids switching plugs."
“抱歉，看来零号机不适合你，”她带着歉意耸了耸肩说道，“一会儿我们会用吊车把你转移到二号机。这样比你们孩子换插入栓要快得多，也简单得多。”

Kensuke nodded. "Okay. Um... by the way... what's with the rainbows in the entry plug?"
健介点了点头。“好的。嗯...顺便问一下...插入栓里的彩虹是怎么回事？”

Misato blinked at him through the comm screen. "Rainbows?" He briefly described the experience he'd just had, but the woman's confusion only seemed to grow. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
美里透过通讯屏幕眨眼看着他。“彩虹？”他简短描述了刚才的经历，但女人的困惑似乎愈发加深。“我完全不知道你在说什么。”

"What you saw then was simply your own brain attempting to make sense of the activation process," said Doctor Akagi in a clinical tone as she appeared on the comm screen next to the captain. "Those clips on your head are connecting you to the Evangelion via neural link, so you end up 'sensing' that process, in a way. When you're actually piloting, you will be able to see and feel what's happening in the same way. There's no external cameras; the Eva's eyes are your eyes."
那时你所见到的，不过是你的大脑试图理解激活过程的产物，"赤木博士以一种临床的口吻说道，她的影像出现在通讯屏幕上，紧挨着船长。"你头上的那些夹子通过神经链接将你与福音战士相连，因此你以某种方式'感知'到了这一过程。实际驾驶时，你将能以同样的方式看到并感受到发生的一切。没有外部摄像头；福音战士的眼睛就是你的眼睛。

Kensuke leaned back slightly in his seat as he digested the information. "...Hang on, wouldn't that mean that I don't need glasses at all while in here? If I'm actually seeing through the Eva's eyes, they wouldn't have the astigmatism that mine do."
健介微微后仰，消化着这些信息。"...等等，那是不是意味着我在这里面根本不需要眼镜？如果我是通过福音战士的眼睛看世界，它们就不会有我眼睛的散光问题。"

Doctor Akagi opened her mouth, then closed it again. A hand came up and she tapped a finger on her cheek in thought. "...That... is most likely true. We've never actually had a pilot that wears glasses before, so it's never come up."
赤木博士张开嘴，又闭上了。她抬起一只手，用手指轻敲着脸颊沉思。"...那...很可能没错。我们之前从未有过戴眼镜的驾驶员，所以这个问题从未被提及。"

The entry plug lurched, and Kensuke felt the odd sensation of moving while sitting still, which told him the transfer was taking place. A minute later, he heard a metallic clunk as the entry plug locked into what he could only assume was Unit-02. On the comm screen, Doctor Akagi began addressing him again.
插入栓猛地一震，健介感受到一种静坐中移动的奇异感觉，这告诉他传送正在进行。一分钟后，他听到一声金属撞击声，插入栓锁定在了他只能推测是二号机的地方。通讯屏幕上，赤木博士再次开始向他讲话。

"Same as before, Aida," she said. "We should have better luck this time though, since Unit-02's the Production Model instead of the Test-Type."
和之前一样，相田，" 她说道，"这次我们应该会更顺利，因为二号机是量产型而非试验型。

"Heh, I'll bet Soryu didn't take too kindly to the fact that someone else might be able to pilot her Eva," Kensuke replied with a chuckle.
"呵，我敢打赌惣流肯定不太乐意别人可能驾驶她的 Eva，" 健介笑着回应。

Doctor Akagi gave a thin smile. "Yes, she did grumble quite a bit. The test will commence in a moment."
赤木博士露出一丝微笑，"是的，她确实抱怨了不少。测试马上开始。"

There was a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, the hairs there standing on end as the rainbows returned. This time, the rainbows lasted longer than a few seconds. A shiver raced through his body as Kensuke felt something that he would only later be able to describe as a ghost passing through him. He blinked, looking down at his limbs as they suddenly felt much heavier. As if...
他的后颈有一种刺痛感，那里的毛发竖立起来，彩虹再次出现。这次，彩虹持续的时间超过了短短几秒。一阵寒意掠过他的身体，健介感到一种他后来才能描述为幽灵穿过的感觉。他眨了眨眼，低头看着自己的四肢，突然感觉它们变得异常沉重，仿佛...

As if they were covered in thick metal armour.
仿佛被厚重的金属盔甲覆盖着。

"Excellent!" came the exultant cheer from Captain Katsuragi. "Unit-02 has activated!"
太棒了！"葛城上尉兴奋地欢呼道，"二号机启动了！

"Sync ratio at... 28.9%," Doctor Akagi added, sounding almost impressed. "Over the activation threshold, but I wouldn't be sending you out to fight just yet."
同步率达到了... 28.9%，"赤木博士补充道，听起来几乎有些惊讶，"超过了启动阈值，但我不建议你现在就投入战斗。

"How good is that?" asked Kensuke. He looked up at the screen, and gasped at what he saw past it.
"这有多好？" 健介问道。他抬头望向屏幕，透过它看到的东西让他倒吸一口凉气。

The grey metal Evangelion cage sat before him, as clear as if he was still outside on the catwalk. He slowly gazed around, noticing how the view lazily tracked his head's movement. On a whim, he removed his glasses; as he expected, everything remained perfectly clear.
眼前清晰地矗立着灰色的金属初号机笼子，仿佛他仍站在外面的检修通道上。他缓缓环顾四周，注意到视野随着他头部的移动而懒洋洋地跟随。一时兴起，他摘下了眼镜；果不其然，一切依旧清晰无比。

"As you can see, you can move the Eva, but you're rather sluggish right now." said Doctor Akagi. "Your movements will have a slight delay, and it will feel like a bit of struggle to actually move around because your sync ratio is so low. As you train and grow more experienced, that ratio will rise and the Eva's movements will become smoother and lighter."
如你所见，你可以操控初号机，但目前动作相当迟缓。" 赤木博士说道，"你的动作会有轻微延迟，移动起来会感觉有些吃力，因为你的同步率很低。随着训练和经验的积累，同步率会提高，初号机的动作也会变得更加流畅轻盈。

"Wow..." Kensuke breathed, still looking around the cage. "So... how do I go about moving my arms and legs then? I don't know how these controls are supposed to work."
哇……" 健介惊叹着，仍在环视笼子。"那么……我该怎么移动我的手臂和腿呢？我不懂这些控制器是怎么操作的。

"Neural link. You will need to think at it." A warning bell began to go off in the cage as red lights flashed. At the same time, Kensuke felt the vague sensation of something that had once been wrapped around his arms fall away. "I've just unlocked Unit-02's arms. Keep your own hands on the controls, but think about moving your arms like you normally would."
神经连接。你需要用心去想。"随着红色警示灯闪烁，警报声在驾驶舱内响起。与此同时，健介感到原本束缚在手臂上的某种东西悄然脱落。"我刚解锁了二号机的手臂。保持你的手在控制器上，但要想象你平时如何移动手臂。

"Think about moving," Kensuke mumbled, returning his glasses to his face for the time being. "Okay, that should be easy. I can move my own body without thinking..."
想象移动，"健介喃喃自语，暂时将眼镜重新戴好。"好的，这应该不难。我不用思考就能移动自己的身体...

It ended up taking a couple of long and boring minutes, but he finally felt his other right arm slowly rising; a red-armoured hand soon came into view in front of his other eyes.
尽管花费了几分钟漫长而乏味的时间，但他终于感觉到另一只右臂缓缓抬起；一只红色装甲的手很快出现在他的另一双眼前。

"Cool," he breathed, slowly rotating the hand back and forth before forming a fist.
"酷，"他轻声说道，慢慢地将手来回旋转，然后握成拳头。

"Sorry to rain on your parade," said a somewhat apologetic-sounding Captain Katsuragi. "But we're gonna shut you down now. You can practise more in the simulator."
抱歉扫了你们的兴，"葛城美里队长略带歉意地说道，"但现在我们要关闭模拟了。你们可以在模拟器里多练习。

Kensuke gave a tiny groan, then stiffened as his view went dark. The shiver returned, this time feeling as if the ghost was leaving his body. He would have to ask the others if that was normal.
洞木光发出一声微弱的呻吟，随后视野一暗，身体僵硬。那股寒意再次袭来，仿佛有幽灵正从他体内离去。他得问问其他人，这种情况是否正常。

A few minutes later, he was standing on the catwalk in front of Unit-02, spitting to try and get the disgusting taste of that orange gunk out of his mouth. Even remembering Soryu's earlier advice about how to quickly get it out of his lungs had been no help. At least this time he was wearing a plugsuit, not a drenched school uniform.
几分钟后，他站在二号机的检修通道前，吐口水试图清除嘴里那令人作呕的橙色粘液的味道。即便回想起惣流之前关于如何快速将其从肺部排出的建议，也无济于事。至少这次他穿的是插入栓服，而不是湿透的校服。

The LCL also left another unwanted present in the form of leftover liquid on his glasses. The best Kensuke could do was flick them a few times to try and clear them, but it still felt like he was looking at the world through an orange rain-spattered window. Any attempt to clean them right now would only make them worse. As a result, he could only just make out the other pilots by their colourful plugsuits before they got closer. He sighed in frustration and removed his glasses so that he could actually see again. Sort of.
LCL 还留下了一份不受欢迎的礼物——眼镜上残留的液体。健介所能做的，只是反复甩动几下来尝试清理，但感觉仍像透过一片被橙色雨滴打湿的窗户看世界。此刻任何试图清洁的举动只会让情况更糟。因此，他只能勉强辨认出其他驾驶员在靠近之前那色彩斑斓的驾驶服。他无奈地叹了口气，摘下眼镜以便能再次看清，尽管效果有限。

"Nice work, Kensuke," said Shinji, giving him one of those slightly anxious smiles that always made Kensuke think that his friend was never sure if his praise would be expected.
"干得不错，健介。" 真嗣说道，给了他一个略带紧张的微笑，那种微笑总让健介觉得他的朋友不确定自己的赞扬是否会被期待。

Soryu gave a slight huff and folded her arms. "Yeah, not bad, rookie. You managed to sync with the Production Model. To be honest I'd be surprised if you couldn't even manage that. Just don't get a swelled head. You'll never be able to pilot it as well as me." She took a step forward and poked him in the chest. "And you had better not break my Eva!"
明日香轻哼一声，双臂交叉。"嗯，还行吧，菜鸟。你成功与量产机型同步了。说实话，你要是连这都做不到，我才会惊讶呢。只是别得意忘形，你永远不可能像我一样驾驭它。" 她向前一步，戳了戳他的胸口。"还有，你最好别弄坏我的 EVA！"

Kensuke gave her a cool look, before turning to Ayanami. "Am I not going to get tested in your Eva as well?"
健介对她投以冷静的目光，随后转向绫波。"我是不是也该在你的 EVA 上测试一下呢？"

Ayanami shook her head. "It is unnecessary now, and is not advisable anyway. Unit-00 is the Prototype; it is not as refined as the Test-Type and Production Model. I am the only one cleared to pilot it, and even I have problems synchronising on rare occasions."
绫波摇了摇头。“现在没有必要，而且也不建议这么做。零号机是原型机；它不如试验型和量产型精细。我是唯一获准驾驶它的人，即便如此，我偶尔也会在同步上遇到问题。”

It was a confusing thought for Kensuke, that these giant robots seemed to have preferences in their pilots.
对于健介来说，这些巨型机器人似乎对驾驶员有所偏好的想法令人困惑。

"Anyway, we'll be heading to the simulators soon," said Soryu, before pointing up at the observation deck window in the top corner of the cage. "Just as soon as they finish up there and move over."
“不管怎样，我们很快就要去模拟器那边了，”索尔尤说道，然后指向笼子顶部角落的观察窗。“等他们那边忙完，我们就可以过去了。”

Kensuke glanced up at the window, seeing the room's occupants bustling back and forth, then back down again to see Ayanami leaning forward slightly and looking curiously at him. "Uh... Ayanami?" he hesitantly said.
健介抬头望向窗户，看到房间里的人们忙碌地来回走动，然后又低头看向绫波，她正微微前倾，好奇地打量着他。“呃... 绫波？”他迟疑地开口。

In response, the red-eyed girl partially tilted her head to one side. "You look... different," she said after an awkward silence.
红眼少女闻言，略微歪了歪头。“你看起来……不一样了，”她在一阵尴尬的沉默后说道。

Kensuke held up his glasses. "Well I'm not wearing these, so... um..." He trailed off as Ayanami took them from his hand, examining them from every angle. Asuka took a step back and put her hands on her hips, seemingly curious as to what was going on.
健介举起他的眼镜。“嗯，我没戴这个，所以……呃……”他话音渐弱，因为绫波从他手中接过眼镜，从各个角度仔细端详。明日香后退一步，双手叉腰，似乎对眼前的情况感到好奇。

"Do glasses really change the look of a person's face that much?" Ayanami wondered aloud as she brought the glasses up to look through the lenses. She squinted, perhaps trying to see clearly through a prescription made for somebody else.
“眼镜真的能让人脸看起来变化那么大吗？”绫波自言自语地拿起眼镜，透过镜片望去。她眯起眼睛，或许正试图透过为他人定制的度数看清事物。

"You've been around my father a lot, right?" Shinji asked. When Ayanami nodded, he continued. "Haven't you ever seen him without his glasses?"
“你经常在我父亲身边，对吧？”真嗣问道。见绫波点头，他继续说：“你没见过他不戴眼镜的样子吗？”

Ayanami gave the question some thought, her hand holding the glasses dropping to her side. "Only once, and at that time I was in no condition to observe much of anything in any detail." She looked down at the glasses, staring blankly for a few seconds, before abruptly putting them on. "Do I look any different now?" she asked, turning her head to look at everybody in turn.
绫波沉思片刻，手中拿着的眼镜垂至身侧。“只有一次，而且那时我状态不佳，未能细致观察周围。”她低头凝视眼镜，愣了几秒后突然戴上。“我现在看起来有什么不同吗？”她问着，转头依次看向每个人。

"Uh... um... err..." Feeling a rush of heat to his face at the sight of her wearing his glasses, Kensuke could only stammer unintelligible words.
“呃...嗯...啊...”看到她戴上自己的眼镜，剑介脸上涌起一阵热意，只能结结巴巴地发出含糊的声音。

"Ooooh!" exclaimed Soryu, raising an eyebrow and grinning at his reaction, which only made it worse.
“哦——！”索龙惊叹一声，挑起眉毛，对着他的反应咧嘴一笑，这让情况更加尴尬。

"What?" Shinji quizzically asked. "What is it?"
“怎么了？”真嗣疑惑地问道，“发生了什么？”

The grin faded as Soryu tilted her head at him, staring for a few seconds before heaving a sigh "...Really? Well anyway, I think they make you look a bit older, Wondergirl. I would also say they make you look more intelligent, but those glasses unfortunately belong to him." She hooked a thumb at Kensuke, who scowled back at her. "I reckon you'll be better off with some narrower glasses if you decide to get some."
笑容逐渐消失，Soryu 歪着头打量着他，凝视了几秒后叹了口气，“真的吗？不过，我觉得它们让你看起来成熟了些，奇迹女孩。我还想说它们让你显得更聪明，但可惜这副眼镜是他的。”她用拇指指向 Kensuke，后者对她怒目而视。“如果你决定要买，我觉得窄一点的眼镜会更适合你。”

"But I do not have any problems with my eyes," Ayanami replied, puzzlement etched on her face.
“但我视力并没有问题，”绫波回答道，脸上写满了困惑。

"Like that matters," Soryu chuckled. "They make glasses that are purely for appearance's sake. A fashion accessory. If you're interested, I could take you somewhere to buy some one day. For now though, let's just get to the simulators. Give Glasses back his glasses before he gets a nosebleed."
“那又怎样，”Soryu 轻笑道，“现在有那种纯粹为了好看的眼镜，就是个时尚配饰。如果你感兴趣，哪天我可以带你去买。不过现在，我们先去模拟器那边吧。把眼镜还给眼镜男，免得他流鼻血。”

Ayanami did as requested, with what seemed strangely like reluctance, and Kensuke stammered his thanks as his hands fumbled around at his waist for a moment. "Wait... these things don't have pockets?"
绫波依言而行，动作中透露出一种奇怪的不情愿，而 Kensuke 在腰间摸索了一会儿，结结巴巴地道谢。“等等……这衣服没有口袋吗？”

"Pockets? Of course not." Asuka exaggeratedly threw her hands up in the air. "Why could anybody in a skintight rubber suit possibly want somewhere to temporarily store things to free up their hands?" With a scoff and an eye-roll, she stalked off. Kensuke followed, but before he reached the doorway out of the cage, he just barely heard a soft, distracted voice behind him that brought redness back to his cheeks.
"口袋？当然没有。" 明日香夸张地举起双手，仿佛在空中比划。"为什么一个穿着紧身橡胶服的人会需要一个地方来暂时存放东西，以便腾出双手呢？" 她嗤之以鼻，翻了个白眼，然后大步离开。洞木光跟了上去，但在他即将走出笼子门口时，他隐约听到身后传来一个轻柔而心不在焉的声音，让他的脸颊再次泛起红晕。

"...Did I do something wrong?"
...我做错什么了吗？

XXX

When Unit-02 feinted with its left fist before punching Kensuke's simulation Evangelion in the head with its right, Shinji winced in sympathy; he had fallen for the exact same trick. When Asuka then swept Kensuke's legs out from underneath him, Shinji simply sighed. Things were going depressingly similar to his own training at her hands; especially the fact that this was now the fourth day of training.
当二号机先用左拳虚晃一招，随后用右拳猛击洞木光的模拟使徒头部时，真嗣感同身受地皱了皱眉；他自己也曾上过同样的当。接着，当明日香将洞木光的腿扫倒时，真嗣只是叹了口气。事情的发展与他在她手下训练时的情景惊人地相似；尤其是这已经是第四天的训练了。

But at least it worked, eventually. Asuka's training seemed designed to make the victim frustrated, to try anything in order to stop getting hit. The first hit Shinji ever landed on her was only successful because he eventually began focusing completely on defense, and studying his opponent to hunt for openings. That one clean punch he had thrown had been a good outlet for all the frustration bottled up inside him.
但至少最终还是奏效了。明日香的训练似乎旨在让受训者感到挫败，为了不再挨打而尝试各种方法。真嗣第一次成功击中她，是因为他开始完全专注于防守，并研究对手以寻找破绽。那次干净利落的出拳，是他内心积压的挫败感的一次良好释放。

Kensuke seemed to be taking a bit longer. He was certainly managing to put up a better defense than Shinji had at first, but a counterattack seemed nowhere in sight. Any punches or kicks he threw simply whiffed past or were easily blocked. The completion of two days of basic training had resulted in Kensuke reaching a somewhat respectable ratio of 33%, and that seemed enough to not be completely overwhelmed by NERV's best pilot.
看来，洞木光需要更多时间。他确实比真嗣一开始时更能防守，但反击似乎遥不可及。他发出的任何拳脚要么擦身而过，要么被轻易挡下。经过两天的基础训练，洞木光达到了 33%的还算体面的成功率，这似乎足以让他不至于完全被 NERV 最优秀的驾驶员所压倒。

Shinji glanced sidelong at Misato, who was lounging in a chair next to him and staring at the holographic screen that was showing the fight. There was a smirk on her face, and he wondered if it had anything to do with Kensuke being a back-seat tactician during the Fourth Angel's attack. The rest of the officers in the simulator control room seemed like they were either enjoying the fight, in the case of the two males, or had better things to focus on, like Doctor Akagi and Lieutenant Ibuki. They seemed more interested in the raw data of the fight rather than the spectacle.
真嗣斜眼瞥向身旁的美里，她正慵懒地坐在椅子上，盯着播放战斗画面的全息屏幕。她脸上挂着一丝笑意，真嗣不禁猜想，这笑容是否与第四使徒来袭时，健介在后方充当战术指导有关。模拟控制室内的其他军官，两位男性似乎正享受着战斗，而赤木博士和伊吹少尉则更专注于战斗的原始数据，而非眼前的壮观场面。

"Come on, Glasses!" Asuka taunted. She was definitely having fun. "By this time Shinji had already nearly taken my head off! Having trouble keeping up?"
加油啊，眼镜仔！" 明日香挑衅道，显然乐在其中。"换成是真嗣，这时候早该差点把我的头砍下来了！跟不上节奏了吗？

"If you're expecting me to get mad and go wildly offensive, you're out of luck," Kensuke retorted as his Evangelion, coloured yellow in the simulation, used both arms to block a roundhouse kick.
"如果你想激怒我，让我疯狂进攻，那你可要失望了，" 健介反驳道，他的模拟机甲以黄色呈现，正用双臂抵挡一记回旋踢。

"Yeah, but this is starting to get tedious!"
是啊，但这已经开始变得无聊了！

Kensuke smirked. "Oh? Do I win by default if you fall asleep from boredom?"
健介嘴角一挑，戏谑道：“哦？你要是听得无聊睡着了，我是不是就算赢了？”

Doctor Akagi looked up at the screen and sighed. "Well I personally would appreciate it if you two didn't take forever. Running simulations costs money, and you two have been burning through quite a lot of it these last few days."
秋吉医生抬头望向屏幕，叹了口气。“我个人是希望你们俩别磨蹭太久。运行模拟是要花钱的，你们这几天可真是烧了不少。”

Something seemed to flash in Kensuke's eyes. "Are you asking us to hurry up?"
健介眼中似乎闪过一丝光芒。“你是要我们快点吗？”

"If you wouldn't mind, that'd be nice," Doctor Akagi grumpily replied. "I have other things I could be doing."
“如果你们不介意的话，那当然最好，”秋吉医生没好气地回道，“我还有别的事要做。”

"Fine, I'll make this quick," Asuka cheekily remarked. "We can always pick it up again tomorrow!"
好吧，我简短点说，" 明日香俏皮地回应道，"反正明天还可以继续嘛！

As soon as she finished speaking, Unit-02 feinted again with its left before throwing a straight right punch. What happened next left the entire control room speechless.
她话音刚落，二号机便再次虚晃一招，左臂佯攻后紧接一记直拳。接下来的情景让整个指挥室陷入沉默。

Unit-02's fist flew past the yellow Evangelion's face, just barely missing its jaw as it leaned out of the way. As the arm reached full extension, Kensuke grabbed it with both hands and turned his Evangelion's back to Asuka. He pulled with a mighty effort, yanking Unit-02 off the ground and over him to slam down on the ground in front of him. Still holding the arm, he forced Unit-02 over onto its stomach and twisted the arm as he placed a foot on the stricken Evangelion's back.
二号机的拳头擦着黄色使徒的脸颊而过，险些击中其下巴，对方及时侧身躲避。当手臂完全伸展时，洞木光双手紧握住它，将自己的使徒转身背对明日香。他奋力一拉，将二号机凌空提起，越过自己重重摔在面前。依旧紧抓手臂不放，他迫使二号机翻身趴地，同时脚踩其背，扭动手臂。

"...Huh, nice move, Glasses," Asuka grunted as Unit-02 struggled. "Unfortunately, you're still a rookie!"
...哼，眼镜仔，动作不错嘛，" 明日香闷哼一声，二号机挣扎着，"可惜你还是个新手！

Kensuke looked about as surprised as she did at what he had just accomplished, but her words caused his eyes to widen. "Huh?"
健介看起来和她一样惊讶于自己刚刚完成的事情，但她的言语让他的眼睛瞪大了。“啊？”

Unit-02's legs came up, kicking Kensuke's Evangelion in the rear end. While Asuka clearly couldn't put much force into the attack from her current position, it was enough to distract him at a critical moment. His grip on her arm loosened just a little, and Asuka took full advantage. Unit-02's hand twisted around and grabbed onto the back of its opponent's neck, and without a second's thought Asuka drove her victim face first into the ground next to her. Unit-02 then hopped to its feet and raised its elbow high above its head before the Evangelion dropped down, the elbow impacting directly in the middle of the Evangelion's back. Kensuke gave a shout of pain and alarm as his Evangelion splayed out on the ground.
二号机的双腿抬起，踢中了健介的使徒的臀部。尽管明日香显然无法从当前位置施加太多力量，但这一击足以在关键时刻分散他的注意力。他对她手臂的抓握稍稍放松，明日香则充分利用了这一点。二号机的手扭转过来，抓住了对手后颈，毫不犹豫地，明日香将她的对手脸朝下猛击到她旁边的地面上。随后，二号机一跃而起，高举手肘，使徒随之落下，手肘正中使徒背部中央。健介痛苦而惊恐地大叫一声，他的使徒瘫倒在地。

"Ow..." Kensuke muttered, twisting in his seat as he tried to rub the sore spot on his back.
“哎哟……”健介嘟囔着，在座位上扭动身体，试图揉搓背上的痛处。

"Okay, I'm going to call it there," Doctor Akagi announced. "Despite some... interesting moves on Pilot Aida's part, Pilot Soryu's the victor."
“好了，就到这里吧，”赤木博士宣布道，“尽管飞行员相田有一些……有趣的举动，但胜者是飞行员惣流。”

"Was there ever any doubt?" Asuka exulted, sparing a moment to massage her shoulder. When Shinji expressed his concern, she rolled her eyes. "Glasses didn't lock it in properly. I'm fine."
难道还有疑问吗？"明日香得意地说道，顺手揉了揉肩膀。当真嗣表示关心时，她翻了个白眼。"眼镜仔没把接口锁好。我没事。

"Well the new guy managed to land a hit of sorts on Asuka," Misato remarked, getting up from her chair and stretching. "That means the next few days are going to be anti-Angel training and group tactics. Which," she added with a pointed look at Kensuke, "I will be handling, buster."
看来新来的家伙倒是成功给了明日香一击，"美里站起身来，伸了个懒腰说道，"这意味着接下来几天我们要进行反使徒训练和团队战术。而且，"她特意看了健介一眼，补充道，"这事儿由我来负责，小子。

"Er... yes ma'am," Kensuke nervously replied, quickly pulling his eyes up to where they belonged.
"呃... 是的，女士，"健介紧张地回答，迅速将目光移回到该看的地方。

Misato flashed him a sunny smile. "Good! Now let's get you two out of your Evas."
美里朝他露出了一个灿烂的笑容。"很好！现在让我们把你们俩从 EVA 里弄出来吧。"

Shinji headed off to the next room, grabbing a couple of towels along the way as well as Kensuke's glasses. The two occupied simulator entry plugs were just starting to open, and he passed a towel to Kensuke and Asuka as they stepped out. Asuka nodded her thanks as she wiped her face clear before draping the towel over her head
真嗣走向下一个房间，途中顺手抓了几条毛巾和健介的眼镜。两个模拟器入口插头刚刚开始打开，他递给刚出来的健介和明日香每人一条毛巾。明日香点头致谢，擦干净脸后将毛巾披在头上。

"That wasn't too bad, Glasses," she said as she patted the towel to soak some of the LCL out of her hair. "Who taught you that one?"
“还不错嘛，眼镜君，”她边说边用毛巾吸去头发上的 LCL 液体。“谁教你的那招？”

"Toji did," Kensuke replied, getting to work on his own hair. "He asked how training was going, I mentioned how you were kicking my ass, and he showed me a few tricks."
“是东治，”健介回答，开始整理自己的头发。“他问我训练进展如何，我提到你一直在碾压我，他就教了我几招。”

Asuka nodded. "Huh, I should have guessed. Well, if it works, and keeps you alive, then it's perfectly fine. The Angels aren't going to fight fair; our job is to put them down as hard and fast as possible, not get into drawn out fights." She stopped and thought for a moment as Kensuke folded his wet towel up, trading it to Shinji for his glasses. "You might not be able to grapple an Angel very well though. Most of the ones we've seen already aren't even slightly humanoid. It'll be better and safer to shoot or stab them instead."
明日香点头道：“嗯，我早该猜到的。只要有效，能保命，那就完全没问题。天使们可不会公平战斗；我们的任务就是尽可能快速狠辣地解决它们，而不是陷入持久战。”她停顿了一下，思考着，此时健介正将湿毛巾叠好，与真嗣交换回眼镜。“不过，你可能不太适合与天使近身格斗。我们遇到的大多数天使连一点人形都没有。用射击或刺击对付它们会更安全有效。”

"Wait, didn't you suplex that giant fish thing?" Kensuke blurted out. "On the Over the Rainbow, it jumped at you and-"
等等，你不是把那条巨型鱼怪过肩摔了吗？" 健介脱口而出。"在‘彩虹之上’号上，它扑向你的时候——

"That... wasn't really a suplex," Asuka interrupted, raising a hand and waggling it side to side in a 'so-so' gesture. "Its own momentum pushed us off the ship, I just grabbed onto it so I could take it with me. Didn't want it smashing up the command ship."
那...其实不算过肩摔，" 明日香打断他，举起一只手，左右摇摆做出一个'马马虎虎'的手势。"是它自己的冲力把我们撞离了船，我只是抓住了它，好带着它一起掉下去。不想让它砸坏指挥舰。

"Ugh. I wish my video camera tape hadn't been confiscated," Kensuke muttered, folding his arms and huffing. "I had some awesome shots of that fight and NERV took them all."
唉，真希望我的摄像机带子没被没收，" 健介嘟囔着，双臂交叉，气呼呼地说。"我拍到了那场战斗的精彩镜头，全被 NERV 拿走了。

"Oh dear, your voyeurism bites you in the ass again; so sad." Asuka pretended to wipe a tear from her eye.
"哎呀，你的偷窥癖又让你自食其果了；真可怜。" 明日香装作擦去眼角的泪水。

Shinji chuckled at Kensuke's despondency. "And there's still that girl who wants her own photo taken, isn't there?"
真嗣对健介的沮丧轻笑一声：“而且，不是还有个女生想让你给她拍照吗？”

"Ah yes!" Asuka perked up, her face suddenly sporting a malicious grin. "You'll have to tell us all about how you were forced to take skimpy photos of a girl when that happens!"
“啊，对哦！”明日香顿时来了精神，脸上突然露出狡黠的笑容，“到时候你可得好好跟我们说说，你是怎么被迫给一个女生拍那种暴露照片的！”

Kensuke put his hands on his face and groaned into them. "Can I please just go home now?" he pleaded.
健介双手捂脸，哀嚎着：“我现在能回家了吗？”他恳求道。

A surprise was waiting for Asuka and Shinji in their lounge room when they arrived home. The tooth that had been broken off of Gaghiel during its final moments now sat in the opposite corner to the television. Its base had been ground down to let it sit flat, and a little metal plaque had been attached, showing the name and number of the Angel, its time and date of death, and crediting Shinji and Asuka with the kill. It just barely fit in between the ground and the ceiling, leaving them both to wonder just how NERV had managed to deliver it.
当明日香和真嗣回到家中的客厅时，一个惊喜正等着他们。加吉尔在最后时刻被打断的那颗牙齿，如今正摆在电视对面的角落里。它的底部已被磨平，以便稳稳地放置，上面还附有一个小金属牌，刻着使徒的名字和编号、死亡的时间和日期，以及将击杀功劳归于真嗣和明日香。这颗牙齿几乎刚好嵌在地面与天花板之间，让他们不禁好奇 NERV 究竟是如何将其运送至此的。

After taking some time to admire the trophy, Shinji and Asuka went next door to talk to Misato about it. She didn't know how it had gotten safely into their apartment either, but said that she had pushed to have the tooth preserved for them as a memento of their first battle together.
花了一些时间欣赏那座奖杯后，真嗣和明日香去隔壁找美里谈论此事。美里也不清楚奖杯是如何安全抵达他们公寓的，但她表示自己曾极力主张将那颗牙齿保存下来，作为他们首次并肩作战的纪念。

"So what do you think about Kensuke being a pilot?" Shinji asked as they went into Misato's lounge room. "I mean, really think?"
那你觉得让健介成为驾驶员怎么样？" 真嗣边走进美里的客厅边问道，"我是说，你真正怎么想？

With her head resting on an upraised hand, Asuka glanced up at the ceiling and hummed in consideration. Pen-pen, having decided to join them, plopped down in front of her and she idly scratched the back of his head with her free hand. "Eehhh... he's got potential at least. He'll probably pick up on the tactics and strategy stuff a lot quicker than you did. But enough about that for now." She sat up and turned to face him. "You didn't notice how he acted around Wondergirl when she tried his glasses on?"
明日香一手托腮，抬头望向天花板，沉吟着。决定加入他们的企鹅 Pen-pen 在她面前一屁股坐下，她便用空闲的手随意挠了挠它的后脑勺。"嗯...至少他有潜力。在战术和策略方面，他可能比你学得快多了。不过现在先不谈这个。" 她坐直身子，转向真嗣，"你没注意到当 Wondergirl 试戴他的眼镜时，他那副样子吗？"

Now that he had had time to think on it, Shinji finally understood Asuka's reaction. "Oh yes. He got rather... ah... nervous."
经过一番思考，真嗣终于明白了明日香的反应。"哦，是的。他确实变得相当...呃...紧张。"

"Wondergirl seemed completely oblivious though."
然而，神奇女孩似乎对此全然不知。

"After you and Kensuke walked off, she sounded confused about how he reacted."
你和健介走开后，她对他是如何反应的感到困惑。

Asuka closed her eyes and waved a hand in dismissal. "Eh, I'm sure she'll figure it out eventually. Anyway, what do you feel like for dinner? Better speak up now before Misato decides to 'make' something."
明日香闭上眼睛，摆了摆手表示不在意。"哎，我肯定她迟早会明白的。话说回来，你晚餐想吃什么？最好现在就说，免得美里又‘做’出什么来。"

"Anything you make will be fine with me, Asuka."
你做什么我都喜欢，明日香。

"Yeah, thanks. That really narrows it down for me." Asuka got up and headed to the kitchen, but paused in the doorway. "...Shinji," she quietly said, partially turning her head. "Are you concerned at all about what this soul contract has done to you?"
嗯，谢了。这真的帮我缩小了范围。" 明日香起身走向厨房，却在门口停下脚步。"...真嗣，" 她轻声说道，半转过头。"你对这个灵魂契约对你造成的影响，有没有一点担心？

"Concerned?" Shinji echoed, then scratched his head. "Well, it's not like we can do anything about it yet. No point getting agitated over something you can't change."
担心？" 真嗣重复道，然后挠了挠头。"嗯，我们现在也做不了什么。为无法改变的事情焦虑也没用。

"But you don't have a soul now. What's going to happen if..." Asuka paused and ran a hand through her hair. "Well, we've got the most goddamn dangerous job in the world. What'll happen if either of us die? Are you functionally immortal without a soul? Am I immortal since I have two? There's just so much weirdness surrounding this damn contract! And I don't even know if we can contact the freaky fire lady to find out!"
但是你现在没有灵魂了。如果...会发生什么？" 明日香停顿了一下，用手捋了捋头发。"我们可是从事着世界上最危险的工作。万一我们中任何一个出了事怎么办？没有灵魂的你是不是就功能性永生了？而我因为有两个灵魂，是不是也永生了？这个该死的契约周围有太多诡异的事情了！我甚至不知道我们能不能联系到那个诡异的火焰女来弄清楚！

The frustration in her voice caused Shinji to stand up and take a step towards her. "What are you so worried about?" he asked. "You're the great Asuka Langley-Soryu. No Angel is going to take you down."
她声音中的烦躁让真嗣站起身，向她迈了一步。"你在担心什么？" 他问道。"你是伟大的明日香·兰格雷-索西尔。没有使徒能打败你。"

"The great..." She blinked and shook her head before looking back at him. "Yeah. You're goddamn right I am. And you... you're the invincible Shinji Ikari!" she announced, pointing challengingly at him and then clenching her fist. "With our dual-sync, we'll tear down anything that stands in our way!"
太伟大了..." 她眨了眨眼，摇摇头，然后重新看向他。"没错，我就是这么厉害。而你...你就是无敌的真嗣·碇！" 她宣布道，挑衅地指着他，然后紧握拳头。"我们双同步，将摧毁一切障碍！

With a smile blossoming on his face, Shinji nodded resolutely. "Yeah!"
真嗣脸上绽放出笑容，坚定地点了点头。"对！"

"Wow, you two sound like a real power couple now!" The smile faltered as Misato suddenly butted into the conversation. "Should I see if Rits would consent to letting those titles being painted on your Eva?"
哇，你们俩现在听起来真像一对强力搭档！" 美里突然插话，笑容有些僵硬。"要不要我去问问律子，看她是否同意把那些称号涂在你们的 EVA 上？

"P-power couple?!" Asuka embarrassedly stammered. "Have you been getting stuck into your booze already?!"
强力搭档？！" 明日香尴尬地结巴道。"你是不是已经开始喝酒了？！

"Nope, but thanks for the suggestion!" Misato chirped as she headed to the fridge, returning moments later with a can of Yebisu. "Now, did I also hear something about dinner?"
不了，但还是谢谢你的建议！" 碇真嗣欢快地说着，走向冰箱，不一会儿就拿着一罐惠比寿啤酒回来了。"对了，我是不是还听到有人提到晚餐了？

With a bemused sigh, Shinji headed to the kitchen to assist Asuka. There was likely going to be yet another dent in the table soon, courtesy of a Yebisu-brand can slam.
带着一丝无奈的叹息，真嗣走向厨房去帮明日香。不出所料，餐桌上很快又要多一个惠比寿啤酒罐砸出的凹痕了。

Just as predicted, Kensuke practically flew through squad tactics training. However, to Asuka's amusement, he took a while to learn how to aim an Evangelion-sized weapon accurately, which made the anti-Angel combat training take longer than it had for Shinji. Kensuke's excuse that a real gun didn't feel as he had expected was simply turned aside by a chortling redhead.
果不其然，健介在战术训练中几乎是一飞冲天。然而，让明日香觉得好笑的是，他花了好一阵子才学会如何准确瞄准使徒大小的武器，这使得对抗使徒的战斗训练比真嗣那时要长。健介辩解说真枪的手感与他预想的不同，但这个理由被一头红发的明日香笑着驳回了。

But eventually, the newest Evangelion pilot 'graduated' from Misato and Asuka's boot-camp. His preferred method of celebration? Going home and falling asleep for a week, according to Kensuke himself shortly before he bid the others farewell.
但最终，这位最新的 EVA 驾驶员还是从美里和明日香的"训练营"中"毕业"了。他选择的庆祝方式？据健介自己所说，就是回家睡上一周，就在他向其他人告别前不久。

"All we can do now is wait for an Angel attack to see how he holds up in real combat," Asuka remarked as she and Shinji returned home. "Training can only do so much."
我们现在只能等待使徒的袭击，看看他在实战中的表现如何，" 明日香说道，她和真嗣一起回家。"训练毕竟有限。

Shinji nodded in agreement. "Yes, it's a lot more... life-threatening than a simulation. No matter how hard you were on him. Us," he added as a correction.
真嗣点头表示同意。"是的，这比模拟要危险得多...无论你对他有多严格。对我们，" 他补充纠正道。

"I'm harsh because you rookies needed a kick in the ass," Asuka replied. "Just sitting and plinking at targets with a Pallet Rifle isn't going to do a damn thing to teach you how to kill an Angel that's right in your face trying to bite your entire body off. It's like the difference between learning a martial art and learning how to survive in a street fight."
我对你们严格是因为你们这些新手需要鞭策，" 明日香回答。"光是坐着用调色板步枪射击目标，根本教不会你们如何对付一个近在咫尺、试图将你整个吞噬的使徒。这就像学习武术和学习街头生存的区别。

Shinji blinked. "You... uh... haven't actually been in a street fight have you?" he worriedly inquired.
真嗣眨了眨眼。"你...呃...其实没真的打过街头斗殴吧？" 他担心地问道。

Asuka waved a hand at him. "Of course not, that was just an example. Why, were you worried about what I might have been up to in the past?" she asked, clasping her hands behind her back and leaning towards Shinji with a grin on her face.
明日香朝他挥了挥手。“当然不是，那只是个例子。怎么，你担心我过去有什么不为人知的秘密吗？”她问道，双手背在身后，身体微微前倾，脸上挂着调皮的笑容。

"No no," Shinji replied with a quick shake of his head. "...Well I'm thinking about it now," he conceded after a moment.
“不不，”真嗣连忙摇头回应，“……不过现在想想，确实有点好奇。”他顿了一下，坦白道。

"Well you'll be happy to know that I remained unmolested during my formative years," Asuka airily state, putting a hand to her chest. She then looked up at the ceiling for a few seconds, then waggled that hand side to side. "There were a few people I wanted to punch in the face though, but that's normal. Right?"
“那你听了应该会放心，我成长期间可是清清白白。”明日香轻描淡写地说着，一手抚胸。她抬头望了望天花板，几秒后，又摆了摆手，“当然，也有几个家伙让我恨不得揍他们一顿，但这很正常吧？”

Having never had that desire, Shinji couldn't comment, and the conversation turned towards more mundane things as dinner time approached.
真嗣自己从未有过这种冲动，所以无从置评，随着晚餐时间的临近，话题转向了更为日常的事情。

XXX

Shinji awoke with a start, taking several sharp breaths as his eyes darted around the room. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the dim light of the moon peeking through the curtain, but Shinji knew that the event in his dream had felt... important. But the remnants skittered away to the corners of his mind, denying him any solid idea what he had just dreamed about. All he had left was the sweat beading on his forehead, and he absently grabbed at his sheet to dab it away. Swallowing and realising how dry his throat was, he slowly got out of bed and headed for the kitchen.
真嗣猛然惊醒，急促地吸了几口气，眼睛在房间里四处扫视。月光透过窗帘的缝隙，一切似乎并无异常，但真嗣知道梦中的事件感觉上……很重要。然而，梦的残片逃逸到了意识的角落，拒绝给他任何清晰的线索。他只留下额头上的汗珠，下意识地抓起床单擦拭。咽了咽口水，意识到喉咙的干涩，他缓缓起身，走向厨房。

Somebody else was already there.
厨房里已经有人了。

"Bad dream too, huh?" Asuka muzzily asked, her eyes still half-shut as she drank from her glass.
"你也做了噩梦吗？"明日香含糊地问道，她的眼睛半睁半闭，正从杯中喝水。

"...I think so," Shinji replied in much the same tone as he got a glass out of the cupboard and filled it almost to the brim at the tap. A fragment of his dream finally deigned to make itself known. "I was... going somewhere. I had to get there. I don't think I was being chased or anything though."
...我想是的，"真嗣用同样的语气回答，他从橱柜里拿出一个杯子，在水龙头下几乎装满了水。梦中的一片段终于显露出来。"我好像...要去某个地方。我必须到达那里。但我不觉得有人在追赶我。

Asuka quirked an eyebrow. "Not exactly much to go on, but then again my recollection's not much better." She drained her glass and set it down in the sink. "Something's happening in front of me and I'm just frozen in place."
明日香挑了挑眉毛。“线索不多，不过我的记忆也好不到哪儿去。”她喝干了杯中的酒，将其搁在洗碗池里。“眼前发生着什么，而我只是僵在原地。”

Shinji hummed into his drink, staring at nothing in particular. "I wonder if our sync training has anything to do with this. Both of us getting woken up by a dream and coming out here, I mean."
真嗣对着饮料发出沉吟，目光漫无目的地游移。“我在想，我们的同步训练会不会和这有关。我们俩都被一个梦惊醒，然后来到这里。”

Giving a lazy shrug, Asuka replied, "Who the hell knows? Besides, it's too-goddamn-early-o'clock. I just wanna get back to sleep right now."
明日香慵懒地耸了耸肩，回应道：“谁知道呢？再说，这他妈的也太早了。我现在只想回去睡觉。”

Right on cue she let out a huge yawn, and Shinji found himself mirroring it perfectly. The two of them blinked at each other for a few seconds before Asuka shook her head, put her hands up, and headed back to her room without a word.
她恰如其分地打了个大哈欠，真嗣也下意识地跟着打了一个。两人对视了几秒，随后明日香摇摇头，举起双手，一言不发地回了自己的房间。

"...Goodnight?" Shinji said to the now empty room before going back to his own bed.
"...晚安？" 真嗣对着空无一人的房间说道，随后回到了自己的床上。

### Chapter 24 That's Some Change

"We probably need to stop meeting like this."
我们可能得停止这样频繁地见面了。

"Mmph" 唔

Shinji dolefully regarded his partner-in-sleeplessness, currently face down on the kitchen table and looking like she was trying to nap right there. Although, considering this was now the sixth night in the last couple of weeks that they had both been woken up by their dreams, he couldn't exactly begrudge her the effort.
真嗣忧郁地看着他那位同样夜不能寐的伙伴，此刻正脸朝下趴在厨房桌上，似乎试图在那里小憩。不过，考虑到这是过去几周里他们第六次被梦境惊醒的夜晚，他实在无法责怪她为此付出的努力。

"Think we should tell Misato about this?" Shinji mused, setting a glass of water down on the table next to Asuka before sitting across from her with his own glass.
"你觉得我们应该告诉美里这件事吗？" 真嗣沉思着，将一杯水放在阿苏卡旁边的桌上，然后在她对面坐下，手里也拿着自己的水杯。

His housemate and friend seemed disinclined to comment for a moment, remaining silent long enough that he began to think Asuka had managed to fall asleep already, but then she finally raised her head just enough to stare at him through the somehow-still-pretty mess of hair falling across her face.
他的室友兼朋友似乎一时不愿评论，沉默了许久，以至于他开始以为明日香已经设法睡着了，但随后她终于微微抬起头，透过那依旧凌乱却别有风情的头发，目光穿过发丝凝视着他。

"Tell her what, exactly?" she grumbled, shifting her arms underneath her chin. "That we're sometimes being being woken up by weird dreams?"
具体告诉她什么呢？"她嘟囔着，将手臂挪到下巴下面。"说我们有时被奇怪的梦惊醒？

"Well..." Shinji scratched his head as he attempted to come up with an answer. The problem was, the dreams weren't... bad? ...Or so it seemed, as neither of them could remember much. If they at least had the decency of being memorable, it would go a long way towards explaining just why he and Asuka kept waking up like they were nightmares.
"嗯..." 真嗣挠了挠头，试图找到答案。问题是，那些梦并不...糟糕？...似乎是这样，因为他们俩都记不清太多。如果这些梦至少有让人记住的体面，那就能很好地解释为什么他和明日香会像被噩梦惊醒一样醒来。

"Maybe Doctor Akagi could get us some sleeping pills or something?" he finally suggested. "I mean, it's certainly affecting our ability to get a good night's rest, and we are Eva pilots."
或许赤木博士能给我们一些安眠药之类的东西？"他最终提议道。"我的意思是，这确实影响了我们好好休息的能力，毕竟我们是 Eva 驾驶员。

"I am not going to drug myself up for such a stupid thing!" Asuka growled, slapping her hands on the table as she rose to her feet. "I am not that weak, and neither are you!"
我才不会为了这种蠢事给自己下药！" 明日香怒吼道，双手猛拍桌子站了起来。"我没那么脆弱，你也是！

"Okay, okay." Shinji placatingly raised his hands, taken aback by the sharp response. "We should probably still tell them though at least, just so they don't think we're slacking off."
好吧，好吧。" 真嗣举起双手，安抚地说，被这尖锐的反应吓了一跳。"我们还是应该至少告诉他们一声，免得他们以为我们在偷懒。

"Hmph. Akagi will probably think we're just making up excuses."
哼。赤木大概会以为我们只是在找借口。

"Both of us? Coming to her and claiming the exact same problem? It's not like we're... um... what's that word for people who keep going to the doctor and saying they have an illness or whatever?"
我们俩都去？去找她，声称遇到了完全相同的问题？我们又不是那种……呃……那种老是去看医生，说自己得了什么病的人，叫什么来着？

"Hypochondriac," Asuka absently replied. "And no, we're not. Hell, we haven't even had a runny nose yet." She lifted her head up with a sigh, leaning back in her seat. "Fine, I suppose we'll tell them at the sync test today. But I'm reserving the right to say 'I told you so' if she ends up dismissing us."
疑病症患者，" 明日香心不在焉地回答。"而且不，我们没有。见鬼，我们连个鼻涕都没流过。" 她叹了口气，抬起头，靠在椅背上。"好吧，我想我们今天同步测试时会告诉他们的。但如果她最终把我们打发走，我有权说'我早就告诉过你了'。

XXX

"If my theory is correct," said Doctor Akagi, leaning forward in her office chair. "And I do hope I'm wrong, but if I'm correct, this is probably something you should have brought to our attention earlier."
如果我的理论正确的话，" 赤木博士说着，身体前倾坐在她的办公椅上。"我真心希望我是错的，但如果我是对的，这可能是你们早该向我们反映的事情。

Asuka and Shinji were now standing in the scientist's office after two sync tests. The first had been the standard fare, but once Shinji had spoken to Misato and Doctor Akagi about the dreams, they had ended up needing to sit around for another, even longer test while the bridge officers did... whatever it was they had done.
经过两次同步测试后，明日香和真嗣现在站在科学家的办公室里。第一次测试是常规的，但自从真嗣向美里和赤木博士谈及那些梦境后，他们不得不坐等另一项更长时间的测试，而指挥桥上的军官们则在忙于... 无论他们做了什么。

Asuka shot a glare sideways at Shinji, who decided he was thankful that he wasn't the 'I told you so' type. "Is it that serious?" he asked, once Asuka finally decided to look away.
明日香斜眼瞪了真嗣一眼，后者庆幸自己不是那种事后诸葛亮的人。"有这么严重吗？" 他问道，直到明日香终于决定移开视线。

Doctor Akagi let out a long breath. "Consider the fact that when you two are in the dual-sync entry plug, you begin synchronising with each other, even with all the safeguards in place." She paused for a moment as Asuka gave a little scoff. "This is something that we had never even expected when working on letting you two pilot together." She waved a hand at her computer. "I could get into the scientific stuff, but I'm sure you wouldn't be able to follow as well as she could."
赤木博士长长地呼出一口气。“想想看，当你们俩进入双同步插入栓时，即使有所有安全措施，你们也开始与对方同步。”她停顿了一下，此时明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。“这是我们在让你们俩一起驾驶时从未预料到的。”她朝电脑挥了挥手。“我可以深入讲解科学原理，但我确信你不会像她那样能跟上。”

Feeling a little hurt that Doctor Akagi didn't even bother to let him try to understand, Shinji slouched a bit.
感受到赤木博士甚至没有费心让他尝试理解，真嗣略显沮丧地垂下了肩膀。

"Every time you two get into the dual-sync plug together, your minds merge a little bit. Back in that first test, we noticed that you, Shinji, were mimicking Asuka even to the point of trying to shift hair out of your eyes. And your combined sync ratio was just continuing to climb as the test went on. Asuka, when we say those safeguards are there for your protection, we mean it."
“每次你们俩一起进入双同步插入栓，你们的思维就会融合一点。在第一次测试中，我们注意到你，真嗣，甚至在试图拨开眼前的头发时都在模仿明日香。而你们的同步率随着测试的进行一直在上升。明日香，当我们说那些安全措施是为了你们的保护时，我们是认真的。”

"That still sounds like a problem though, if our minds are merging," Asuka interjected. "We're already dreaming and waking up in sync."
“即便如此，如果我们的思维正在融合，这听起来仍然是个问题，”明日香插话道。“我们已经开始做梦并在同一时间醒来。”

Doctor Akagi brightened up a little. "Well at least there is some good news. The safeguards are ensuring that the unintended merging is very slow. You'd have to spend hours at a time in the plug, or disable the safeguards, before there would be anything more noticeable than dreaming at the same time." She tapped a finger against her chin as her eyes drifted back to her computer monitor. "I would like to run another set of tests, but that would involve not using the dual sync plugs for a while to see if your minds return to normal during a prolonged period away from the entry plug." Her eyes darted back to the teenagers in front of her. "That's entirely up to you of course, but it would mean that you'd be back on the sidelines when the next Angel strikes, Shinji."
赤木医生稍稍振作了一些。"嗯，至少有些好消息。安全措施正在确保意外融合的进程非常缓慢。你们必须在插入栓里连续待上数小时，或者关闭安全措施，才会出现比同时做梦更明显的现象。"她用手指轻敲下巴，目光又飘回到电脑屏幕上。"我想再进行一组测试，但这意味着要暂时停止使用双同步插头，以观察你们的大脑在长时间远离插入栓后是否能恢复正常。"她的目光迅速转向面前的两个少年。"当然，这完全取决于你们，但这意味着下一次使徒来袭时，你将再次成为旁观者，真嗣。"

Shinji inhaled sharply. Being relegated back to uselessness, having to watch other people fight for their lives while he could have helped them? "No," he said. "We're Eva pilots. We've handled everything the Angels have thrown at us so far, we can handle this too."
真嗣深吸了一口气。被贬回无用之地，眼睁睁看着别人为生存而战，而他本可以伸出援手？"不，"他说，"我们是 EVA 驾驶员。迄今为止，我们已应对了使徒抛给我们的一切，这次我们也能应对。"

Eyebrows raised at his response, Doctor Akagi gave him a look that almost seemed to say that she was impressed. "Funny. You opened your mouth, but I heard Asuka speaking just then."
听到他的回答，秋吉医生眉头一挑，那眼神仿佛在说，她有些刮目相看。"有意思。你开口说话，我却听到了明日香的声音。"

"Uh..." Shinji glanced at Asuka, who simply raised her hands and shook her head.
"呃..." 真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，她只是举起双手，摇了摇头。

"Hey, you were the one who wanted to talk to someone about this," she remarked. "I said I was fine with the dreams."
嘿，是你想找人谈谈这事儿的，" 她指出。"我说过，我对这些梦没意见。

"What you said was that we're not weak enough to ask for drugs," Shinji retorted. He rubbed the back of his head. "Still, this is your decision as well. If you're fine with keeping things as they are, then I'm fine too."
你原话是我们还没弱到需要药物的地步，" 真嗣反驳道。他挠了挠后脑勺。"不过，这也是你的决定。如果你觉得维持现状没问题，那我也无所谓。

"Oh for..." Asuka palmed her face, glowering at Shinji through her fingers. "What have I told you about that non-committal attitude? Make your decision."
哦，真是……" 明日香用手捂着脸，透过指缝怒视着真嗣。"我跟你说过多少次了，别总是这么模棱两可的态度，做个决定吧。

His face reddening at the reprimand, Shinji looked back at Doctor Akagi. "We'll... continue as we are."
被训斥得脸红，真嗣回头看向赤木博士。"我们……还是继续保持现状吧。"

"Fair enough,"Doctor Akagi said with a shrug. "Just keep an eye out for any behaviours more severe than... synchronised wake-ups or whatever. Although... I suppose I should say that you need to keep an eye on each other for any strange behaviours."
行吧，" 赤木博士耸了耸肩说，"只是要注意一下，如果有比……同步醒来之类的更严重的行为。不过……我想我应该说，你们得互相留意对方是否有任何异常行为。

"Like what?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow.
"比如什么？" 明日香挑起一边眉毛问道。

Doctor Akagi glanced sidelong at her, before smirking evilly. "Well, if you find Shinji with... feminine hygiene products, or if you start wearing his clothes, you might want to be concerned."
秋月医生斜眼瞥了她一下，然后邪恶地咧嘴一笑。“好吧，如果你发现真嗣带着...女性卫生用品，或者你开始穿他的衣服，那你可能就要担心了。”

Both Shinji and Asuka's faces lit up red like tomatoes.
真嗣和明日香的脸顿时红得像西红柿一样。

XXX

When Shinji and Asuka got home, no less confused than when they had left that morning, it was to another surprise in their living room. To be more precise, a surprise visitor.
当真嗣和明日香回到家时，他们并不比早上离开时更明白，迎接他们的却是客厅里的另一个惊喜。确切地说，是一位意外的访客。

A tall, literally flame-haired visitor in a business suit, admiring the giant tooth trophy.
一位高挑、名副其实的火焰红发访客，身着商务套装，正欣赏着那座巨大的牙齿奖杯。

Asuka recovered first. "Hello Bwynvienne. If you're wondering, the creature we took that from could have levelled this entire building with just a flick of its tail."
明日香最先恢复过来。“你好，Bwynvienne。如果你好奇的话，我们从那生物身上取下的这颗牙齿，它只需轻轻一甩尾巴，就能夷平整栋建筑。”

Bwynvienne turned around, greeting them with a smile. "It is good to see you again, Ms Soryu, Mr Ikari." She glanced over her shoulder at the tooth. "This tooth reminds me of my fourth mate," she said with a wry grin.
Bwynvienne 转过身来，微笑着向他们打招呼。“很高兴再次见到你们，Soryu 小姐，Ikari 先生。”她回头瞥了一眼那颗牙齿，“这颗牙齿让我想起了我的第四任伴侣，”她带着一丝苦笑说道。

"...Fourth?" Shinji echoed.
“……第四任？”真嗣重复道。

"You're not some kind of maneater, are you?" Asuka warily asked.
“你该不会是什么食人族吧？”明日香警惕地问道。

"Hmm?" Bwynvienne, seemingly lost in thought for a moment, swiftly turned her attention back to them. "Maneater?"
嗯？" 布温维恩似乎一时陷入了沉思，随即迅速将注意力转回他们身上。"食人者？

"A... a femme fatale," said Asuka, saying something that sounded like English to Shinji's untrained ears. "Er... a female version of a womaniser."
就是... 一个蛇蝎美人，" 明日香说道，用了一个对真嗣未经训练的耳朵来说像是英语的词。"呃... 类似于女性版的情场高手。

Bwynvienne's eyes widened slightly in realisation, and she vigorously shook her head. "Aah. No, nothing like that. Marriage between Infernals isn't always a permanent thing, such as that contract you two inadvertently signed. For instance a new couple may only choose to be married for a hundred years to start off with, and when that time is up they can then choose to either sign a new marriage contract or simply part ways."
布温维恩的眼睛微微睁大，恍然大悟，然后用力摇了摇头。"啊，不是那样的。地狱生物之间的婚姻并不总是永久性的，就像你们俩无意中签订的那种契约。比如，一对新婚夫妇可能一开始只选择结婚一百年，当这段时间结束后，他们可以选择签订新的婚姻契约，或者干脆分道扬镳。"

Shinji made a face. "That just sounds so... clinical. Like love doesn't even matter."
真嗣皱起了眉头。"这听起来太... 冷冰冰的。好像爱情根本不重要似的。"

Asuka snorted in derision. "Ever heard of arranged marriages? Half the time one or both of the people to be wed have no say at all."
明日香嗤之以鼻，嘲讽道：“听说过包办婚姻吗？很多时候，要结婚的两个人根本就没有发言权。”

"We Infernals live very long lives," said Bwynvienne. "Rather like a human's lifespan compared to one of those... dog things you have here. Things change, people change over the course of centuries."
“我们恶魔的寿命非常长，”布温维耶说，“就像人类的寿命与你们这里的狗相比一样。几个世纪的时间里，事物会变，人也会变。”

"How ol-" Shinji began to ask, before self-preservation instincts kicked in and his jaw forced itself shut. He then very carefully rephrased the question. "What's the average lifespan of an Infernal?"
“你多——”真嗣刚要问，求生本能突然涌上心头，他的下巴不由自主地闭上了。然后他小心翼翼地重新措辞：“恶魔的平均寿命是多少？”

Bwynvienne thought a moment. "A bit of a tricky question. Generally about several thousand of your years, but that depends on the type of Infernal."
布温维耶思索片刻，答道：“这个问题有点复杂。一般来说，大约是你们的几千年，但这取决于恶魔的种类。”

"...Type?" ...类型？

The woman with fiery hair gestured at herself. "Do you think every Infernal looks just like me? When I said that tooth reminded me of my fourth mate, I was not being hyperbolic."
那位红发女子指了指自己。“你以为每个地狱生物都长得和我一样吗？当我说那颗牙齿让我想起我的第四任伴侣时，我并没有夸张。”

Asuka caught on first. "Are you saying he was a giant... fish monster?!"
明日香最先反应过来。“你的意思是，他是个巨大的...鱼怪？！”

Bwynvienne grinned widely. "Fish monster, no. Giant, yes."
布温维耶咧嘴一笑。“鱼怪，不是。巨大，是的。”

Shinji and Asuka stared incredulously at each other. Shinji put his hands up, signalling that he was absolutely not about to ask the next question.
真嗣和明日香难以置信地互望着。真嗣举起双手，示意自己绝对不会问下一个问题。

"Anyway, I believe we've gotten rather off track," said Bwynvienne, thankfully changing the subject. "The Infernal Administration has looked into your case, and while I'm afraid we still cannot nullify the contract until the five year lock has expired, we have at least managed to work out just how the contract came to your world in the first place."
不管怎样，我想我们已经严重偏离了主题，"布温维尼说，幸好她转移了话题。"地狱行政部已经调查了你的案件，恐怕我们仍无法在五年锁定期满之前取消合同，但我们至少弄清楚了合同是如何来到你们世界的。

Shinji hummed in thought. "I'm going to guess that since you... since Infernals can apparently teleport easily, somebody came to Earth a while ago and... left an actual contract sitting around somewhere when they left?"
真嗣沉吟着说："我猜，既然你们……既然恶魔们似乎能轻易地传送，那么有人很久以前来到地球，离开时……在某个地方留下了一份真正的合同？"

"That is... almost exactly what happened. Another Infernal did visit Earth," Bwynvienne confirmed, before raising a hand. "Before you say anything, they were an Infernal that looked something like me, so they could blend in easily. They were on vacation, fell in love-"
那正是……几乎完全发生了的事情。另一个恶魔确实访问过地球，"布温维尼确认道，然后举起一只手。"在你说什么之前，他们是一个看起来和我有些相似的恶魔，所以他们能轻易融入环境。他们是来度假的，坠入了爱河——

"Oh no," Asuka groaned, bringing up a hand to cover her face. "The two of them got married, the Infernal brought up the contract, and the idiot signed because they thought it was a cute, silly little thing."
哎呀，" 明日香呻吟着，举起一只手遮住脸。"那两个人结婚了，恶魔拿出了契约，而那个傻瓜因为觉得那是个可爱的小玩意儿就签了。

"Exactly correct, Ms Soryu," Bwynvienne said with a despairing sigh. "And considering the lifespan difference between our species, a til-death-do-us-part contract like yours is practically the same as a 'starter' marriage contract. As far as we can tell though, they both did love each other, and they did trade souls equally. Unlike..."
说得没错，索琉小姐，" 布温维恩叹了口气，带着绝望。"考虑到我们两个种族的寿命差异，像你们这样的至死不渝的契约，几乎等同于一个'入门级'婚姻契约。不过据我们所知，他们确实相爱，并且灵魂交换也是平等的。不像……

"Unlike the idiot I am who gave his soul away for a snack," Shinji muttered.
"不像我这个傻瓜，为了点零食就把灵魂给出卖了，" 真嗣喃喃自语。

Bwynvienne shrugged. "You read the contract, you agreed to the terms, you signed it. As far as the Infernal Administration is concerned, you only have yourself to blame."
布温维恩耸了耸肩。"你读过契约，同意了条款，签了字。就恶魔行政管理而言，你只能怪自己。"

"But I will be able to give him his soul back when the lock expires... right?" asked Asuka.
"但等到契约到期，我就能把他的灵魂还给他了...对吧？" 明日香问道。

"Of course. You'll have the choice to either keep his soul or return it to him, and you may then enter into another contract if you so desire."
当然。届时你将有权选择保留他的灵魂或归还给他，之后你也可以选择是否再次缔结契约。

"No thanks," Asuka immediately replied. "All this contract stuff is too goddamn weird for me. Sure I've gotten stronger in my Eva because I have two souls, but..." She pointed at Shinji. "It came at the cost of making him weaker. He's a pilot, the same as me, and he is now essentially crippled. I want to be the best pilot through my own hard work! Not because of... of this damn contract!"
不用了，" 明日香立刻回答。"这些契约的事对我来说太他妈诡异了。虽然因为拥有两个灵魂，我在我的 Eva 里变强了，但是..." 她指向真嗣。"这却让他变弱了。他和我一样是驾驶员，现在却几乎成了残废。我要通过自己的努力成为最优秀的驾驶员！而不是靠...靠这个该死的契约！

Bwynvienne stared at her for a moment. "All I can say to that is that you can only play the hand you are dealt in life. If you have a problem, you need to learn how to solve the problem, or work around it."
布温维尼凝视了她一会儿。"对此我只能说，人生中你只能打你手里的牌。如果遇到问题，你需要学会解决问题，或者设法绕过它。"

"I... suppose the dual-sync plan is basically working around it," Shinji mused. "I can pilot with you, and together we can take down the Angels and survive long enough to reach that five year expiry date things."
我... 想双同步计划基本上是在绕过这个问题，" 碇真嗣沉思道，"我可以和你一起驾驶，联手击败使徒，并存活足够长的时间，直到那个五年期限的到来。

Asuka slumped slightly. "Yeah, I suppose so."
明日香略显颓然，"嗯，我想也是。"

Bwynvienne nodded in satisfaction. "Very well, I must head off now. I have so many other clients to see to, you would not even believe it. Is there anything else before I leave?"
布温维尼满意地点了点头，"很好，我现在得走了。我还有那么多其他客户要照顾，你简直无法想象。在我离开之前，还有什么事吗？"

"Oh!"

"Yes there is!" 是的，还有事！

Both teenagers spoke at the same time. They glanced at each other, and Shinji gestured for Asuka to continue. "Does a soul contract between two people also affect their sense of taste? Shinji can only taste food that I prepare for him. Anything else tastes like..." She glanced sidelong at him with a little scowl. "Tastes like bland, apparently."
两个少年同时开口。他们互看一眼，真嗣示意明日香继续。“灵魂契约会影响两个人的味觉吗？真嗣只能尝出我为他准备的食物的味道。其他东西尝起来都像是……”她斜眼瞥了他一下，略带不满地说，“显然，尝起来很淡。”

"Ah yes, a minor side effect of soul transferral between two people in a marriage contract," said Bwynvienne. "Their needs can only truly be satisfied by each other. If both of you had traded souls, you would only be able to enjoy food made by each other. And of course there's... other things..." She looked carefully at the two of them and grinned. "I'm pretty sure neither of you are old enough for that yet, but when you are... oh my!"
“啊，是的，这是婚姻契约中两人灵魂转移的一个小副作用，”布温维妮说，“他们的需求只能通过对方得到真正满足。如果你们交换了灵魂，你们就只能享受对方做的食物。当然还有……其他事情……”她仔细打量着两人，咧嘴一笑，“我确信你们俩现在还没到那个年纪，但等到了那时候……哦，天哪！”

"Oh god!" Asuka exclaimed, her face turning red. "She's just as bad as Misato!"
“天啊！”明日香惊呼，脸颊泛红，“她跟美里一样糟糕！”

"What about sleep?" Shinji interjected. "Do people under a soul contract get each other's dreams, and wake up at exactly the same time?"
“那睡眠呢？”真嗣插话道，“处于灵魂契约中的人会共享梦境，并且同时醒来吗？”

It was rather surprising to see someone like Bwynvienne look confused. "Er... that, I..." She frowned. "I... can't say I've ever heard of that happening."
看到像 Bwynvienne 这样的人显得困惑，着实令人惊讶。"呃...那个，我..."她皱起眉头，"我...得说我从未听说过这种事发生。"

This time when Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, it was with expressions of utter bafflement. If the contract wasn't to blame for their odd sleep patterns, then what was?
这一次，当真嗣和明日香再次对视时，他们的脸上写满了彻底的困惑。如果契约不是他们奇怪睡眠模式的罪魁祸首，那又会是什么呢？

"I'll ask around, but don't get your hopes up," said Bwynvienne. "If nothing else happens, and if I don't find anything about your sleep issue, I shall see you two again when the contract lock expires. Farewell for now."
我会四处打听，但别抱太大希望，"Bwynvienne 说，"如果再无其他变故，而我也没能找到关于你们睡眠问题的线索，那么契约锁到期时，我们再见。暂别了。

In the time it took for Shinji and Asuka to blink, Bwynvienne vanished from their apartment. Silence filled the room for a solid minute as the two teenagers thought on what they had just learned.
就在真嗣和明日香眨眼的功夫，Bwynvienne 已从他们的公寓中消失无踪。房间里静默了一分钟，两位少年沉浸在刚刚得知的信息中，思绪万千。

"...Hey," said Shinji as realisation occurred. "We didn't get interrupted by Section Two this time."
...嘿，" 碇真嗣恍然大悟地说，"这次我们没有被第二部门打断。

Asuka looked up at him, then in the direction of their front door. Last time, Section Two had burst into their apartment, pointed guns at Bwynvienne, and had almost accidentally shot her in the head. After a moment, she went through the kitchen and opened the front door, peering outside. Two large men in black suits were patrolling along the hallway at that moment. She stared at them, and they glanced at her before returning their attention to their patrol.
明日香抬头看向他，然后望向他们的前门。上次，第二部门的人冲进他们的公寓，用枪指着布温维恩，差点不小心射中她的头部。过了一会儿，她穿过厨房，打开前门，向外窥视。此刻，两个身穿黑色西装的大个子男人正在走廊上巡逻。她盯着他们，他们瞥了她一眼，然后继续他们的巡逻。

"Hey you two," she called out, making them stop and give her their full attention. "Anything happen around here?"
喂，你们两个，" 她喊道，让他们停下来，全神贯注地看着她。"这里有什么事发生吗？

The men looked at each other for a couple of seconds, then back to her. "Nothing to report, Ms Soryu. All's quiet."
那两个男人对视了几秒钟，然后又看向她。"没有需要报告的，惣流小姐。一切都很平静。"

"...Ah. Well then... must have been my imagination. Carry on."
...啊，那么... 可能是我多心了。继续吧。

"Ma'am." 夫人。

Back in the apartment, Asuka shared what she'd found out with Shinji. "I guess this time she thought ahead and somehow... concealed her presence," she concluded.
回到公寓后，明日香向真嗣分享了她所发现的情况。"我猜这次她事先想到了，并且不知怎么... 隐藏了自己的行踪，"她总结道。

"Last time, apparently the MAGI were able to detect her," said Shinji. "How is she able to block the sensors of something that can detect even hints of an Angel?"
上次，显然 MAGI 系统能够探测到她，"真嗣说。"她是怎么做到屏蔽掉连天使踪迹都能探测到的传感器的呢？

Together, they turned and stared at where Bwynvienne had been standing.
他们一同转身，凝视着布温维恩曾站立的地方。

Just what in the world was an Infernal?
这世上究竟什么是恶魔？

XXX

It was yet another scorching hot day. School had just ended, and the heat seemed like it was trying to melt Shinji's shoes to the pavement. The lack of even a slight breeze meant that the air itself was practically cooking him alive. The time of day, and the fact that they were essentially walking towards the sun, meant that there was no shade to hide in. He was already tired thanks to P.E. class earlier that day -thankfully held in the gym rather than outdoors- and there was a dull throbbing ache in the back of his head, like somebody was insistently tapping his skull with a hammer.
又是一个酷热难耐的日子。学校刚放学，热浪仿佛要将真嗣的鞋子熔化在路面上。连一丝微风都没有，空气简直像在把他活活烤熟。时值午后，他们几乎是在迎着太阳行走，无处可寻阴凉。由于当天早些时候的体育课——幸好是在体育馆内而非户外进行——他已感到疲惫不堪，后脑勺隐隐作痛，仿佛有人不断用锤子轻敲他的头骨。

Next to him, Asuka was almost stumbling along, arms hanging listlessly at her sides. "Fuck. This. Heat," she mumbled, repeating it in time with her plodding gait.
身旁的明日香几乎是在踉跄前行，双臂无力地垂在两侧。“该死的。这。热。”她喃喃自语，每走一步就重复一遍。

Shinji couldn't muster up the strength to turn his head towards her. All his energy was currently being devoted towards stubbornly putting one foot in front of the other. Hope began to stir in his chest as he realised they were coming up to a turn that would put a building between them and the sun, even if only for a short time. The two of them just barely made it around the corner, Asuka almost collapsing against the wall as she raised a hand to swipe the sweat off her brow.
真嗣连转头看向她的力气都提不起来。此刻，他所有的精力都用来倔强地迈出一步又一步。当他意识到他们即将经过一个拐角，那里的建筑会短暂地遮挡住阳光时，心中开始萌生希望。两人勉强拐过墙角，明日香几乎瘫靠在墙上，举起手来擦去额头上的汗水。

"I have an idea," she said after a minute, staring across the street at nothing in particular. Shinji hummed in an interrogative manner, and she continued. "We get all four pilots into our Evas, we pick the Geofront up, and we move to Germany where it isn't so goddamn hot."
我有个主意，"她过了一会儿说道，目光漫无目的地扫过街道对面。真嗣以询问的语气哼了一声，她继续说："我们让所有四名驾驶员进入自己的 Eva，把 Geofront 抬起来，搬到德国去，那里不会这么该死的热。

Shinji chuckled, leaning against the wall to the left of Asuka and rubbing his head where it was still pulsing with pain. He drew up what saliva he could to moisten his mouth and asked, between gasps of breath, "Where... would we put it... back down though? I doubt there's... anywhere big enough... to hold it."
真嗣轻笑一声，靠在明日香左边的墙上，揉着还在隐隐作痛的头部。他尽力分泌唾液润湿干涩的口腔，喘着气问道："可是...我们把它...放哪儿呢？我怀疑...没有足够大的地方...能容纳它。"

Asuka tapped her chin in thought for a moment, before coming up with a solution. "Simple. We get that big blue diamond bastard, turn it into a drill, and dig the hole ourselves."
明日香轻敲下巴沉思片刻，随即想出了办法。“简单。我们把那个大蓝钻石混蛋弄来，做成钻头，自己挖洞。”

"And how would you cross the ocean in the first place?"
“那你一开始要怎么过海呢？”

Scoffing derisively, Asuka replied, "Easy! We hitch a ride on the fish Angel and... wait..."
明日香嗤之以鼻，回答道：“小菜一碟！我们搭乘鱼天使的便车，然后……等等……”

Shinji blinked. He hadn't been the one to ask that question. Leaning forward to peer around Asuka, he saw somebody he hadn't seen in quite a while. "...Mr. Kaji?"
真嗣眨了眨眼。提问的并不是他。他探身向前，绕过明日香，看到了一个许久未见的人。“……加持先生？”

"Kaji?!" Asuka perked up, looking around frantically before noticing the perpetually scruffy man on her right, having just stepped out of a shop. "Kaji!"
卡西?!" 明日香一激灵，慌忙四下张望，这才注意到右边那个总是邋里邋遢的男人，刚从一家店里走出来。"卡西！

The heat apparently entirely forgotten, she practically skipped over to the man and threw her arms around his waist for a hug; an inexplicable pang of jealousy then proceeded to shoot through Shinji's chest.
显然完全忘记了炎热，她几乎是蹦跳着跑到那人跟前，张开双臂紧紧抱住他的腰；一股莫名的嫉妒随即刺穿了真嗣的胸膛。

"Hey, kiddos," Kaji said by way of greeting, patting Asuka's shoulder a few times before gently prising her off of him. "I just stopped by here to get some water. I take it by your totally reasonable plans that you're not appreciative of today's weather either?"
嘿，小家伙们，" 卡西以此作为问候，拍了几下明日香的肩膀，然后轻轻地将她从自己身上拉开。"我刚路过这里买了点水。看你们这副理所当然的样子，想必也不太喜欢今天的天气吧？

"Too exhausted... to give you a proper response... Mr. Kaji," Shinji panted, wincing as his headache grew more intense.
"太累了... 没法给你个像样的回答... 卡西先生，" 真嗣喘着气说，头痛加剧让他不禁皱眉。

"Hmm." Kaji brushed past Asuka, moving up to Shinji and grabbing his wrist. Shinji tiredly looked on as the man pinched the skin on the back of his hand, frowning at whatever he saw before heading back towards the shop he had just come out of. "Back in a sec, kids."
嗯。" 加持从明日香身边擦过，走向真嗣并抓住他的手腕。真嗣疲惫地看着，那人捏了捏他手背上的皮肤，皱着眉头，似乎看到了什么，然后转身朝他刚出来的商店走去。" 马上回来，孩子们。

Shinji blinked in puzzlement, staring at the back of his hand where he had been pinched. Before he had time to comment, Asuka was suddenly in front of him, repeating Kaji's actions. Still not understanding what was going on, he was rather confused when she growled in anger.
真嗣困惑地眨了眨眼，盯着自己被捏过的手背。他还来不及说什么，明日香突然出现在他面前，重复了加持的动作。他仍然不明白发生了什么，当她愤怒地咆哮时，他更加困惑了。

"I should have known you were lying at lunchtime," she muttered. "Now you're dehydrated as hell!"
我早该知道你午餐时在撒谎，" 她嘟囔道。"现在你脱水得要命！

"I wasn't lying though!" Shinji protested. "I really didn't feel thirsty when you said you were, so I gave you my water."
可我并没有撒谎啊！" 真嗣辩解道。"当你说你渴的时候，我真的不觉得渴，所以我就把水给你了。

"Here." Kaji reappeared, holding out two bottles of water purchased from the shop. "I want both of you to drink these. Today's a hell of a scorcher."
给。" 加持再次出现，手里拿着从店里买来的两瓶水。"你们俩都喝点。今天热得要命。

Shinji reached out and took the proffered bottle, wrenching the cap off and practically pouring the water directly down his throat. Only then did Asuka finally stop scowling at him and start drinking as well.
真嗣伸手接过递来的水瓶，拧开盖子，几乎是直接把水灌进喉咙。直到这时，明日香才停止了对他的怒视，也开始喝水。

"You kids want me to take you the rest of the way home?" Kaji offered once their bottles were empty, before gesturing at a maroon-coloured sports car parked nearby. "Or would you rather cook some more?"
你们想让我送你们回家吗？" 加持在他们喝完水后提议，同时指向附近停着的一辆枣红色跑车。"还是你们想再晒会儿太阳？

"Oh yes please!" said Asuka, almost bouncing up and down. Her sudden attitude shift left Shinji's head spinning.
"哦，太好了！" 明日香几乎跳了起来。她态度的突然转变让真嗣感到一阵眩晕。

No wait, that was probably the dehydration.
等等，那可能是脱水导致的。

"We'd appreciate that, Mr. Kaji," he added. "If it's not too far out of your way."
我们非常感激，卡吉先生，" 他补充道，"如果这不会太绕路的话。

"I'm actually headed there myself," Kaji cheerfully replied with a shrug. "So it's no problem at all."
我其实也正要去那里，" 卡吉愉快地回答，耸了耸肩，"所以一点也不麻烦。

"Really?" Asuka's eyes lit up. "Are you finally coming to spend some time with m- with us?"
真的吗？" 明日香的眼睛亮了起来，"你终于要来和我们一起待会儿了吗？

"Ehhh, not quite, Asuka." Kaji sheepishly rubbed the back of his head, unable to maintain eye contact with the girl. "Misato and I finally have some free time that lines up, so we'll be going out for drinks tonight."
哎呀，不是那样的，明日香。" 加持尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，不敢直视女孩的眼睛。"我和美里终于有时间凑到一起了，所以今晚我们会出去喝一杯。

Shinji frowned. The last time he had seen the two adults interact, if it could even be called that, Misato couldn't wait for Kaji to be gone from her sight. Now they were supposedly friendly enough to be going to a bar together? Adulthood seemed like such a confusing mess.
真嗣皱起了眉头。上次他看到这两个大人互动，如果那也能算互动的话，美里巴不得加持从她视线中消失。现在他们竟然友好到可以一起去酒吧了？成年人的世界似乎是一团乱麻。

Asuka had apparently asked something while he was thinking, because Kaji replied, "I'd really like to bring you along too, but you're too young to drink in this country."
显然，在真嗣思考的时候，明日香问了些什么，因为加持回答说："我真的很想带你一起去，但在这个国家，你还太小不能喝酒。"

The disarming grin the scruffy man gave Asuka didn't seem to help, as she turned away and huffed, petulantly stomping a foot.
那位胡子拉碴的男人对明日香露出的安抚笑容似乎并不奏效，她转过身去，气呼呼地跺了跺脚。

"Well anyway, come along you two. It's far too hot to be standing around out here."
不管怎样，你们两个快跟上。外面这么热，站在这里太难受了。

That was something all three of them could agree on without question. Shinji clambered into the back seat while Asuka took the front. Kaji turned the key, the engine roared to life, and the air conditioner came on at full power.
这一点，他们三人无疑都深有同感。真嗣爬进后座，而明日香则坐到了前排。加持转动钥匙，引擎轰鸣启动，空调随即全力运转起来。

"Oooohh my god," Asuka groaned in relief from the front passenger seat, sticking her face directly in front of one of the air vents, which sent some of her hair billowing out behind her. "Praise be to Willis Carrier, patron saint of cold air."
哦，我的天啊，" 明日香坐在副驾驶位上，如释重负地呻吟着，将脸直接凑到其中一个空调出风口前，几缕发丝随风飘扬。"赞美威利斯·开利，冷气之神的庇佑。

The drive was over far too soon, but thankfully it wouldn't be long before they would be back in their apartment. Kaji stopped at the door to Misato's apartment, giving them a farewell wave before pressing the buzzer. As Shinji waited for Asuka to unlock their own door, he saw the door to the other apartment open and a hand reach out to grab Kaji by the shirt. Shinji blinked, and the man was gone.
车程结束得似乎太快，但幸好不久他们就能回到自己的公寓。加持在美里公寓门前停下，向他们挥手告别后按响了门铃。真嗣等待明日香打开他们自己的房门时，看到另一间公寓的门打开，一只手伸出抓住了加持的衬衫。真嗣眨了眨眼，那人已不见踪影。

Yes, adulthood was truly strange.
是的，成年人的世界确实很奇妙。

Stepping into their own apartment, Shinji was puzzled yet again. This time, it was due to seeing Asuka putting her ear to the wall next to the fridge. She caught his stare and glared at him as he opened his mouth, putting a finger to her lips to signal silence. Shinji sighed and, as quietly as he could, opened the fridge to retrieve two cans of soda. Closing the fridge door, he was just in time to see Asuka huff and push herself away from the wall. He lamely offered up one of the cans, which was snatched from his hand as Asuka stomped off to the lounge room.
踏进自己的公寓，真嗣再次感到困惑。这次是因为看到明日香正把耳朵贴在冰箱旁边的墙上。她察觉到他的目光，瞪了他一眼，同时将手指放在唇边示意他保持沉默。真嗣叹了口气，尽可能轻声地打开冰箱，取出两罐汽水。关上冰箱门时，他正好看到明日香哼了一声，从墙上推开自己。他无奈地递出一罐汽水，却被明日香一把夺过，随后她气冲冲地走向客厅。

Come to think of it, teenagehood was rather odd as well, sometimes.
回想起来，青春期有时候也挺奇怪的。

The next day was just as horrible temperature-wise. The apartment's air-conditioner, as good as it was, was barely managing to keep up with the heat-wave. After a restless night, Shinji was honestly considering pitching Asuka's maybe-not-so-insane idea to somebody at NERV if the weather didn't hurry up and improve. But as he and Asuka set out for school that morning, they saw something which brought them a modicum of hope: clouds could be seen far off in the distance. They both agreed that the change couldn't come soon enough.
第二天，气温依旧糟糕透顶。尽管公寓的空调性能出色，但在热浪面前也显得力不从心。经过一夜的辗转反侧，真嗣真心考虑过向 NERV 的某人提出明日香或许并不疯狂的想法，如果天气还不尽快好转的话。但那天早上他和明日香去学校时，他们看到了一线希望：远处出现了云层。两人一致认为，这种变化来得越快越好。

Especially since the school's cooling system was having problems.
尤其是因为学校的冷却系统出了问题。

Shinji was practically sprawled out on his desk, his shirt sticking uncomfortably to the sweat on his back. Their teacher seemed immune to the weather, droning on about some centuries-old war that went on for thirty years, which simply made a lousy day worse. All around Room 2-A, students were trying to nap in their seats or chatting on their laptops. Even Rei, stoic in the face of an Angel attack, seemed to be suffering in the heat. From what he could see of her face, it was paler than usual, and somewhat sunken. The curtains had been drawn to try and block out the glaring sun, but it was a task they were ill-suited for, thin as they were.
真嗣几乎瘫倒在课桌上，衬衫因背上的汗水而粘腻不适。他们的老师似乎对天气免疫，滔滔不绝地讲述着一场持续了三十年的、数百年前的战争，让本就糟糕的一天雪上加霜。在 2-A 教室里，学生们或在座位上试图小憩，或在笔记本电脑上聊天。就连面对使徒攻击都面不改色的绫波，似乎也在酷热中煎熬。从他能看到的那张脸上，她的脸色比平时更苍白，略显憔悴。窗帘已被拉上，试图阻挡刺眼的阳光，但它们太薄，难以胜任这项任务。

Asuka was on her laptop as well, but a quick glance over her shoulder showed that she wasn't in one of the chat rooms. Whatever she was looking at, it wasn't in German or Japanese, so Shinji couldn't work out what it was. It didn't seem to be entertaining her much either, judging by how Asuka was slouched in her seat and occasionally sighing as she scrolled through lines of text.
明日香也在用笔记本电脑，但快速瞥了一眼她的屏幕后发现，她并没有在聊天室里。无论她在看什么，都不是德语或日语，所以真嗣无法弄清楚内容。从明日香瘫坐在座位上、不时叹气并滚动浏览文字的样子来看，这似乎也没能让她感到多少乐趣。

To the great relief of the entire student body, the lunch bell chose that moment to ring, and only the intimidating presence of Class Representative Horaki prevented a stampeding rush to escape the classroom. The students of Class 2-A sheepishly shuffled past the glaring young lady, and were smart enough not to immediately charge down the corridor. Shinji, Asuka and Rei were the last ones to exit, joining up with Hikari, Toji and Kensuke to make the journey to the cafeteria together.
令全体学生大为宽慰的是，午餐铃恰在此时响起，若非班长堀崎的威严镇住了场面，恐怕教室里早已上演一场夺门而逃的戏码。2-A 班的学生们尴尬地从那位目光凌厉的少女身边鱼贯而过，明智地没有立刻冲向走廊。真嗣、明日香和零是最后离开的，他们与光、东治和健介汇合，一同前往食堂。

Ever since arriving at school that morning, Shinji had noticed that Toji seemed to have something on his mind. And now that they had some free time, he could finally give voice to whatever that was.
自从那天早上到校以来，真嗣就注意到东治似乎心事重重。现在有了空闲，他终于有机会吐露心声了。

"Hey, uh... you pilot guys?" he asked, rubbing the back of his head. "Can I ask you somethin' about NERV?"
“那个，呃……你们这些驾驶员？”他边说边挠着后脑勺，“我能问点关于 NERV 的事儿吗？”

Kensuke blinked and shrugged, handing the question off to the veteran pilots. Rei replied with, "Only if it does not compromise operational security."
健介眨了眨眼，耸肩将问题抛给了经验丰富的驾驶员们。零回答道：“只要不涉及操作安全即可。”

Toji shook his head. "Nah nah, nothin' like that... I hope. Uhh..." He finally let his arm drop to his side. "Somethin's happened with my sister. Yesterday Hisae got taken out of Tokyo-3 General Hospital by NERV." Shinji noticed that while Asuka and Rei seemed to simply be puzzled by the news, Kensuke was suddenly looking rather shifty. "Any of you guys heard about why?"
东治摇了摇头。“不不，不是那种事...我希望不是。呃...”他终于把手臂垂到身侧。“我妹妹出了点事。昨天，久美被 NERV 从东京-3 综合医院带走了。”真嗣注意到，虽然明日香和零似乎只是对这消息感到困惑，但剑介突然显得有些心神不宁。“你们有人听说过为什么吗？”

"I am sorry," said Rei. "But I have not heard anything about that."
“我很抱歉，”零说道，“但我没有听说过这件事。”

"Yeah, me neither," added Asuka, and Shinji shook his head. "Why, is there a problem with that?"
“是啊，我也不知道，”明日香补充道，而真嗣也摇了摇头。“怎么，这有什么问题吗？”

Toji shrugged. "I dunno, it just came outta nowhere! First I heard of it was when I went to visit and got told at the desk that she'd been moved out!"
东治耸了耸肩。“我也不清楚，这事来得太突然了！我第一次听说是在我去探望时，前台告诉我她已经被转移走了！”

Kensuke suddenly cleared his throat. "Uh, Toji? I... have something I need to tell you."
健介突然清了清嗓子。“呃，东二？我...有件事得告诉你。”

Toji stared at him for a moment. "...Wait til we sit down," he said as the group reached the double doors leading to the cafeteria. He pushed the door open and stared into the room for a few seconds, before taking a step back and letting the door close. "Ah... guess that ain't gonna happen."
东二盯着他看了一会儿。“...等我们坐下来再说，”他说道，这时他们一行人来到了通往食堂的双开门前。他推开门，朝里面凝视了几秒钟，然后后退一步，让门关上。“啊...看来这事是没法发生了。”

A glance through the door's window told Shinji everything he needed to know. The cafeteria was so full that students were sitting on the floor.
透过门上的窗户一瞥，真嗣便知晓了一切。食堂里人满为患，学生们甚至坐在地上。

"What do you expect?" Kensuke remarked with a despairing groan. "The air conditioning actually works properly in there."
“你还能指望什么？”健介绝望地叹了口气说，“那里的空调可是正常工作的。”

"Well then let's just go in!" exclaimed Asuka. "Better than going back and getting slow-cooked in the classroom!"
那我们就进去吧！"明日香大声说道，"总比回去在教室里慢慢闷熟强！

Thankfully, there was still a little space left for their group. The girls sank down to the floor against the wall next to a vending machine, while the boys sat opposite them. The noise in the cafeteria was almost deafening; a cacophony of voices all talking over each other.
幸好，他们这群人还勉强挤得下一点空间。女孩们靠着墙坐在自动售货机旁的地板上，男孩们则坐在她们对面。食堂里的噪音几乎震耳欲聋，各种声音交织在一起，嘈杂不堪。

"So what were ya sayin'?" Toji asked of Kensuke, leaning towards him so that he wouldn't have to shout over the chattering students.
"你刚才说什么来着？"东治向健介探过身去，以免在学生们叽叽喳喳的谈话声中不得不大声喊叫。

Kensuke glanced at him. "Huh? Oh, right." He cleared his throat again. "Um... Toji... I'm the reason your sister got transferred to NERV. And there's no need to worry, she's gonna be getting the best medical care in the world."
健介瞥了他一眼，"啊？哦，对了。"他又清了清嗓子，"嗯...东治...你妹妹转到 NERV 是我安排的。不用担心，她将得到世界上最好的医疗照顾。"

Toji, along with the others, stared at him in disbelief.
剑司和其他人一样，难以置信地盯着他。

Asuka gave voice to the question everyone was thinking. "How the hell did you manage to do that?"
明日香说出了大家心中的疑问：“你到底是怎么做到的？”

"Simple." Kensuke was actually starting to look rather proud of himself, now that the secret was out. "I made it a condition of my becoming a pilot."
“很简单。”健介现在开始显得有些自豪，既然秘密已经揭晓。“我把它作为成为驾驶员的条件之一。”

The disbelief grew larger. Asuka's head reared back, Rei quirked an eyebrow, and Shinji opened and shut his mouth as he struggled to come up with a response. Hikari was the first one to get her mind moving again. "...Why?" She blushed slightly as attention was drawn to her. "I-I mean it's definitely a good thing! But... why did you make that a condition?"
众人的惊讶愈发强烈。明日香往后一仰，绫波微微挑眉，而真嗣则是张口结舌，努力寻找回应。还是光最先回过神来，“为什么？”她略带羞涩地问道，当大家的目光转向她时，她有些脸红，“我的意思是，这当然是好事！但是……你为什么要以此为条件呢？”

Kensuke sighed, and related to them his reasoning of how NERV had screwed up -something Asuka vehemently agreed with- and needed to be held accountable. The disbelief turned into admiration, even if it was somewhat grudging on Asuka's part.
健介叹了口气，向他们阐述了自己关于 NERV 搞砸了事情——明日香对此强烈赞同——并需要为此负责的看法。怀疑逐渐转变为钦佩，尽管明日香的部分钦佩有些勉强。

"Dude," Toji whispered, the word almost lost in the noise of the cafeteria. "I... ah, the hell with it." He swiftly wrapped his arms around Kensuke, patting him several times on the back. "Thanks bro," he mumbled. "You ain't got no idea how much this means to me."
哥们，" 东治低声说道，声音几乎淹没在食堂的嘈杂中。"我...啊，管他呢。" 他迅速张开双臂抱住健介，用力拍了几下他的背。"谢了兄弟，" 他嘟囔着。"你根本不知道这对我来说意味着什么。

"Of course I understand, man!" Kensuke replied, patting Toji's shoulder. "Why do you think I did it? I could have just asked them for money or something, but instead..." He trailed off as Toji let go of him.
"我当然理解，伙计！" 健介回答道，拍了拍东治的肩膀。"你以为我为什么要这么做？我本可以直接向他们索要钱财之类的，但相反..." 他话没说完，东治就放开了他。

"Yeah, I getcha. I probably woulda demanded they heal her if I'd been picked." Toji glanced at Shinji and Asuka for a moment, then roughly shook his head. "Anyway, can I ask a favour of you guys?"
嗯，我明白。如果被选中的是我，我可能会要求他们治愈她。" 东治瞥了一眼真嗣和明日香，然后粗鲁地摇了摇头。"话说，我能请你们帮个忙吗？

Asuka folded her arms, glaring suspiciously back at him. "What kind of 'favour'?"
明日香双臂交叉，怀疑地瞪了回去。“什么样的‘帮忙’？”

With a roll of his eyes, Toji replied, "Gee, whaddaya think, Red? I wanna get into NERV to see my sister!"
东治翻了个白眼，回答道：“哎，你想什么呢，红毛？我想进 NERV 去看我妹妹！”

Asuka blinked, then relaxed her arms, looking at her fellow female pilot. "There shouldn't be any problem with that, right Wondergirl?"
明日香眨了眨眼，然后放下手臂，看向另一位女性驾驶员。“这应该没什么问题吧，对吧，奇迹女孩？”

"The hospital is a lower security area compared to much of the Geofront," Rei replied. "It should be no trouble to get Suzuhara permission, seeing as his relative is under NERV's care."
“与地下大部分区域相比，医院的安全级别较低，”绫波丽回答。“既然他的亲属在 NERV 的照顾下，给铃原获得许可应该不成问题。”

"Let's head there after school then," Shinji suggested. "The weather might still be lousy, but I'm sure Toji doesn't want to wait."
那放学后就过去吧，" 真嗣提议道，"天气可能依旧糟糕，但我肯定东治不想再等了。

"Uh, yeah..." Hikari absently replied, staring at the far end of the cafeteria. "About that weather..."
呃，是啊..." 光无意识地回应着，目光投向食堂的另一端。"关于那天气...

"Huh?" Shinji looked over, to see that several of the students in the cafeteria were standing at the window looking outside. The light coming through was dimming rapidly. "Has that change finally come in?"
嗯？" 真嗣转头望去，只见食堂里好些学生正站在窗边向外张望。透进来的光线迅速暗淡下来。"难道变化终于来了？

"Maybe..." Kensuke got to his feet, waving at the others to stay where they were. After a bit of manoeuvring through the crowded room he managed to reach the window, where he stared out at the sky for a few seconds before returning with a look of puzzlement on his face. "That's some change," he muttered.
"或许吧..." 健介站起身，示意其他人留在原地。他费了些劲在拥挤的房间里穿梭，终于到达窗边，凝视天空几秒后，带着一脸困惑返回。"这变化可真不小，" 他喃喃自语。

"What do you mean?" asked Hikari.
"你什么意思？"光问道。

"It's gone from a hot clear day to a sky full of dark clouds," replied Kensuke, casting a look over his shoulder at the window. "Like a storm's coming."
从晴朗炎热的一天变成了乌云密布的天空，"健介回答道，回头望向窗户。"像是暴风雨要来了。

It was as if the universe itself had been waiting for those words; the instant they left Kensuke's mouth, four cellphones jingled in unison. Their owners stared at each other, grim expressions on their faces.
仿佛宇宙本身就在等待这些话语；就在健介说完的那一刻，四部手机同时响起。它们的主人面面相觑，脸上露出严峻的表情。

### Chapter 25 Sahaquiel

"Well, I can't say I wasn't expecting that at least a little bit," Asuka quipped as the pilots pulled out their phones to check the message.
"哎，我不能说我一点都没预料到，" 明日香打趣道，这时驾驶员们纷纷掏出手机查看信息。

CODE 2. 代码 2。

"Code 2?" Kensuke wondered aloud.
"代码 2？" 健介不解地大声问道。

"Probable Angel incursion," Asuka replied, tucking her phone away. "Not a hundred percent guaranteed to be an Angel yet, but NERV wants us there in case it is. Code 1 is a definite Angel attack, and Code 3 is a non-Angel situation that requires us to be at NERV, like for safety or whatever. Come on, Section Two will be waiting outside for us."
可能是使徒入侵，" 明日香回答着，收起手机。"虽然还不百分百确定是使徒，但 NERV 希望我们到场以防万一。代码 1 代表确认的使徒攻击，代码 3 则是非使徒情况，需要我们回 NERV，比如为了安全之类的。快点，第二部门的人应该在外面等我们了。

"Be careful!" Hikari called after them as the pilots headed off, stunned students barely getting out of their way in time. Shinji looked over his shoulder and nodded at her and Toji before exiting the cafeteria.
"小心点！" 光在他们身后喊道，飞行员们匆匆离去，惊愕的学生们勉强及时让开路。真嗣回头看了她和东治一眼，然后离开了食堂。

Any rule about running in the hallways didn't matter to the pilots; NERV business trumped such petty rules. The four of them ran as fast as they could towards the main school entrance, Asuka shoving the door open with her shoulder and sending it slamming against the wall outside. Four men in black suits, having just been running towards the door, skidded to a stop and urgently waved the teenagers on, falling into step next to them as they approached the black sedans parked outside the school gate.
走廊里禁止奔跑的规则对飞行员们来说无关紧要；NERV 的事务凌驾于这些琐碎规定之上。四人全速奔向学校主入口，明日香用肩膀猛地推开门，门砰地一声撞在墙外。四名身穿黑西装的男子，刚巧也正朝门口跑来，急忙停下脚步，焦急地挥手示意少年们快走，随后与他们并肩而行，向校门外停着的黑色轿车靠近。

"Do we know anything yet?" Kensuke asked of the agents as they slowed to a halt to get into the cars.
"有什么消息了吗？" 健介在准备上车时向特工们问道。

"Nothing concrete," one of them replied. "I heard mention of our satellites picking something up though."
还没有确切消息，" 其中一人回答，"但我听说我们的卫星捕捉到了一些东西。

Any more conversation had to be put on hold; the pilots were split up two to a car, with Asuka and Shinji practically getting shoved into the back of the first vehicle while Kensuke and Rei took the second. The car engines, left running for obvious reasons, roared as the small convoy took off in a manner reminiscent of Misato's driving. Shinji gripped his seatbelt with both hands and idly wondered, as he struggled to stay upright in his seat, whether she had led the driving course these agents had clearly graduated from.
更多的对话不得不暂时搁置；飞行员们被分成两人一组，分别上了车，明日香和真嗣几乎是被推搡着进了第一辆车的后座，而剑介和零则上了第二辆。由于显而易见的原因，汽车引擎一直处于运转状态，随着小型车队以一种让人联想到美里驾驶风格的方式出发，引擎轰鸣声大作。真嗣双手紧抓安全带，一边努力在座位上保持平衡，一边漫不经心地想，这些特工显然是从美里那里学来的驾驶课程。

"So this one's coming from space, huh?" Asuka mused, arms folded but otherwise relaxed, casually leaning sideways as the car took a sharp turn. "That could be a problem, depending on how far away it is and how fast it's coming at us."
这么说，这个是从太空来的，对吧？"明日香沉思道，双臂交叉，但整体放松，随着车辆急转弯，她随意地侧身倚靠。"这可能是个问题，取决于它离我们有多远，以及它朝我们飞来的速度有多快。

"What do you mean?" Shinji asked, trying to remember anything he had ever learned about satellites and space, which wound up being practically nothing.
"你指的是什么？"真嗣问道，试图回忆起他所学过的关于卫星和太空的一切，结果几乎是一无所知。

"The thing about space is that you can see for years. Literally," Asuka said with a wry grin. "Anything moving towards Earth, or even wandering our solar system would be picked up well before it could even be considered dangerous. Unless it was travelling ridiculously fast."
太空的特点是，你可以看到数年之外的东西。字面意思，"明日香带着一丝狡黠的笑容说道。"任何朝地球移动，甚至只是在我们太阳系中游荡的物体，都会在它构成威胁之前就被早早发现。除非它以极其惊人的速度移动。

That piqued Shinji's curiosity. They were still a couple minutes out from the Geofront; he needed something to keep his mind off what was potentially to come. "Um... how fast are we talking?"
这激起了真嗣的好奇心。他们离 Geofront 还有几分钟的路程；他需要找点事情来分散自己对即将可能发生之事的注意力。"呃... 你说的速度有多快？"

"Well for an extreme example, let's say an alien ship near Jupiter fired a projectile at 99.99% the speed of light. By the time we detected the launch, thirty-five minutes later, we'd only have two seconds before that projectile hit Earth."
就拿一个极端例子来说，假设木星附近的一艘外星飞船以 99.99%光速发射了一个投射物。当我们探测到发射时，三十五分钟后，我们只有两秒钟的时间来应对那个投射物击中地球。

Shinji gulped nervously at the prospect. "A-and there's nothing we could do to stop that?"
真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫。"那... 我们就没有任何办法阻止它吗？"

"Even if you could get a missile off to intercept it, it wouldn't make enough of a difference. In fact, the projectile could just break up, in which case you'd have more projectiles coming at you to worry about." Asuka let out a breath. "Science can be rather scary sometimes, like when it comes to kinetic energy..."
即使你能发射导弹进行拦截，也于事无补。事实上，投射物可能会碎裂，那样你还得担心更多碎片朝你袭来。"明日香叹了口气。"科学有时挺吓人的，比如涉及到动能的时候...

Seeing Shinji's nervousness, she sought to allay his fears. "Oh don't worry, it would take absolutely ludicrous amounts of energy to get up to that kind of speed, and I'm sure even an Angel can't manage that."
看到真嗣的紧张，她试图缓解他的担忧。“哦，别担心，要达到那种速度需要极其荒谬的能量，我相信即使是使徒也做不到。”

"Maybe they have some kind of stealth ability though," the blonde agent in the passenger seat suddenly remarked. "These Angels are made out of bullshit anyway; I wouldn't be surprised if one of them can turn invisible or something. Could explain how this one just showed up right on Earth's doorstep, so to speak."
“也许它们有某种隐形能力，”坐在副驾驶的金发特工突然说道。“这些使徒本来就是扯淡的存在；如果其中一个能隐形，我也不会感到惊讶。这或许能解释这个使徒怎么就突然出现在地球家门口了。”

"Problem with thinking like that is where does it end?" the dark-haired driver replied with a shake of his head. "First it's Angels that can cloak themselves, soon it's Angels pretending to be human."
“问题是，这样想下去何时是个头？”黑发司机摇头回应。“先是能隐形的使徒，接着就是伪装成人类的使徒。”

"...Oh scheiße," Asuka and Shinji muttered in sync.
“...哦，糟糕，”明日香和真嗣异口同声地低语。

Now it was Section Two's turn to try and calm them both down. "Hey relax, kids, there's still that blood type detection thing the MAGI have. Don't waste your energy on pointless paranoia."
现在轮到第二区来尝试平息双方的紧张情绪了。"嘿，放松点，孩子们，MAGI 还有血型检测这一招呢。别把精力浪费在无谓的猜疑上。"

"Speaking of which..." Blonde put a finger to his ear for a moment. "Okay yeah, it's been confirmed that it's an Angel up there. Couple hours at best before it reaches us."
说到这个..." 金发男子用手指轻触了一下耳朵。"好的，确认了，上面确实是个使徒。最多几个小时它就会到达我们这里。

"Good thing we've arrived then. Be interesting to see how the big-wigs handle this," his partner quipped as they sped through the gate into NERV.
"幸好我们及时赶到了。看看那些大人物怎么处理这种情况，应该挺有意思的，" 他的搭档调侃着，两人疾驰穿过闸门进入 NERV 总部。

XXX

The pilots, kitted out in their plugsuits, stared up at the screen showing what was apparently the angel; a large black sphere that would have been practically invisible against the backdrop of space were it not for the multitude of eye-like symbols skittering across its surface.
驾驶员们身着插入栓服，抬头凝视着屏幕上显示的使徒——一个巨大的黑色球体，若非表面游走着的众多眼睛状符号，它几乎会与太空背景融为一体，难以察觉。

Kensuke tilted his head to one side. "Are we... getting attacked by a psychedelic soccer ball?"
健介侧了侧头，问道：“我们这是……被一个迷幻的足球攻击了吗？”

"No," replied Doctor Akagi from where she was leaning over Lieutenant Ibuki's shoulder. "This Angel's AT-Field is powerful enough to bend light around it. This is just what our sensors are capable of perceiving."
“不，”从她俯身在伊吹中尉肩后的位置，赤木博士回答道，“这个使徒的 AT 力场强大到足以使光线在其周围弯曲。这只是我们的传感器所能感知到的样子。”

Lieutenant Ibuki turned in her seat to address Misato. "The MAGI are reporting a ninety-nine point nine-nine recurring percent chance that it's aiming directly for us."
伊吹中尉转过身来，面向美里报告：“MAGI 报告说，有百分之九十九点九九的重复概率，它正直接朝我们而来。”

"Of course it is," Misato sighed. "Well, let's roll out the welcome mat." She looked over at Lieutenant Hyuga. "Initiate orbital bombardment."
“当然如此，”美里叹了口气，“好吧，让我们铺开欢迎的地毯。”她看向日向中尉，“启动轨道轰炸。”

"Orbital bombardment?!" Shinji exclaimed as the lieutenant began carrying out the order. "NERV can attack things in space?!"
轨道轰炸？！" 真嗣惊呼道，此时中尉已经开始执行命令。"NERV 能在太空攻击目标？

"Of course we can, Shinji!" Misato replied with a grin. "Never know where an Angel might attack from!"
当然可以，真嗣！" 美里笑着回答。"谁知道使徒会从哪里发起攻击呢！

"Well now they've attacked us from literally every angle," Lieutenant Aoba quipped. "Land, sea, air, in a volcano, and now space. All that's left to surprise us is... I don't know... time travel or something."
现在他们已经从各个角度攻击我们了，" 青叶中尉打趣道。"陆地、海洋、空中、火山内，现在又是太空。剩下的能让我们惊讶的，我想想……或许是时间旅行之类的吧。

"I'm just surprised every other country in the world is apparently okay with weapons of mass destruction literally hovering over them," Asuka remarked with folded arms.
"我只是惊讶，世界上其他国家似乎都对头顶上悬着的大规模杀伤性武器无动于衷，" 明日香双臂交叉，评论道。

"Satellites twenty-three through thirty rotating to engage target!" Lieutenant Hyuga reported.
"卫星二十三至三十号转向，准备锁定目标！" 日向中尉报告道。

Conversation ended as the holographic screen shifted images, now showing the view from a different satellite. Explosions began to ripple across the screen, accompanied by an equal number of shimmering hexagons. There had been no smoke trails to mark their passage, something which confused Shinji until he realised that space-based weaponry would work differently to anything ground-based.
随着全息屏幕切换图像，对话戛然而止，此刻显示的是另一颗卫星的视角。屏幕上开始出现连绵的爆炸，伴随着同样数量的闪烁六边形。没有烟迹标示它们的轨迹，这让真嗣感到困惑，直到他意识到太空武器与地面武器的工作原理截然不同。

"No effect from the N2 bombardment," Hyuga announced a moment later, sounding rather understandably disappointed.
"N2 轰炸没有效果，" 片刻后，日向宣布道，声音中透露出完全可以理解的失望。

Misato groaned, raising a hand to rub her forehead. "Alright, get in touch with Commander Ikari. What's the ETA on impact?"
美里叹了口气，举手揉了揉额头。"好吧，联系碇司令。预计撞击时间是什么时候？"

"At its current rate of speed, barring any changes..." Ibuki typed away at her computer. "It will hit us in approximately one hundred and thirty-eight minutes."
以目前的速度，如果没有变化的话……" 伊吹在电脑上敲打着。"大约一百三十八分钟后就会撞击我们。

"Not much time for a solution," Kensuke mused.
"留给解决方案的时间不多了，" 健介沉思道。

"Nope," said Aoba. "And the Angel's AT-Field must be scrambling our commsat signals as well. We can't reach the Commander."
没错，" 青叶说。"而且使徒的 AT 力场肯定也在干扰我们的通信卫星信号。我们联系不上指挥官。

"Of course we can't," Misato quietly sighed. She shut her eyes for a moment; when she opened them again, they were almost blazing with determination. "Then it's all up to us. We're going to need a hell of a plan."
当然联系不上，" 美里轻声叹息。她闭上眼睛片刻；当她再次睁开时，眼中几乎闪烁着决心的火焰。"那么一切都靠我们了。我们需要一个极其出色的计划。

The four teenagers were left standing around outside a room where the 'important people' were having a meeting. Apparently, being the pilots of the only weapons capable of stopping the incoming threat wasn't enough to merit being in that room as well; something that Asuka had already voiced her opinion on, albeit out of earshot of the officers in question.
四个少年被留在了会议室外，那里正举行着一场“重要人物”的会议。显然，作为唯一能阻止即将到来的威胁的武器驾驶员，这还不足以让他们也进入那个房间；明日香对此已经表达过不满，尽管是在那些军官听不到的地方。

Now she was slowly pacing up and down the corridor as precious minutes ticked past, occasionally grumbling in German. Kensuke and Rei were standing off to one side, him leaning against a wall with his arms folded, her standing stock still and staring at nothing.
此刻，她正缓缓地在走廊上来回踱步，宝贵的时间一分一秒地流逝，偶尔用德语嘟囔几句。真嗣和绫波站在一旁，他背靠着墙，双臂交叉，而她则静静地站着，目光空洞地凝视着虚空。

"It's too bad we can't just fly up there and engage it away from Earth," Kensuke suddenly spoke up. "I'm surprised NERV doesn't have Eva-sized jetpacks or something."
“真可惜我们不能直接飞上去，在地球外与之交战，”真嗣突然开口说道，“我惊讶于 NERV 竟然没有给 EVA 配备类似喷气背包之类的东西。”

"The power required to lift an Evangelion off the ground is an order of magnitude greater than any device it could potentially carry," Rei replied. "Specialised aircraft are required for air transport, and they are both slow and require frequent refuelling. There is also the issue of powering the Evangelions themselves. Even the external batteries we used against Matarael would only give us fifteen minutes of usable time, less once we begin combat."
将使徒从地面抬起所需的能量，比它可能携带的任何设备都要大一个数量级，"绫波丽回答道。"需要专门的飞机进行空中运输，而这些飞机既缓慢又需要频繁加油。还有使徒自身供电的问题。即使是我们在对抗马特拉尔时使用的外部电池，也只能提供十五分钟的可用时间，一旦开始战斗，时间会更短。

Kensuke sighed, one hand taking off his glasses of as the other swiped down his face. "Nuclear power would be out, since having a nuclear reactor in a combat situation would be a colossally stupid idea."
洞木光叹了口气，一手摘下眼镜，另一只手从脸上抹过。"核能肯定不行，因为在战斗情况下携带核反应堆是个极其愚蠢的想法。"

"Thank you!" Asuka swivelled around and raised her hands to the ceiling in exultation. "Well done, Glasses, you're officially smarter than whoever the hell came up with that dumbass Jet Alone project!"
谢谢！"明日香转过身来，双手举向天花板，欢欣鼓舞。"干得好，眼镜，你正式比那个搞出愚蠢的 Jet Alone 计划的蠢货聪明多了！

Rei frowned. "I do not understand how such a concept made it past the concept stage without somebody bringing that problem up."
绫波丽皱了皱眉。"我不明白这样的概念是如何在概念阶段没有被某人提出问题就通过的。"

"Because people are idiots, Wondergirl," Asuka said with a sigh. "I'm sure all its creators wanted was to one-up NERV. They didn't even have a plan for breaching an AT-Field. They thought NERV was making that up for god's sake!"
因为人们都是傻瓜，Wondergirl," 明日香叹了口气说道，"我敢肯定，它的创造者们只是想超越 NERV。他们甚至没有突破 AT 力场的计划。他们以为 NERV 是为了上帝才编造出这个的！

"So then how are we going to deal with this Angel?" Shinji asked, trying to pull them back on topic. "It's going to be coming at us pretty fast. We wouldn't have time to do anything much before it hits."
那我们该怎么对付这个使徒呢？" 真嗣试图将话题拉回正轨，"它冲过来的速度会非常快。我们可能还没来得及做什么，它就已经攻击过来了。

Asuka tapped a finger on her chin. "Well... it's going to have a hell of a lot of momentum... If only we could turn that against it somehow."
明日香用手指轻敲着下巴，"嗯...它的动量肯定非常大...要是我们能设法利用这一点反制它就好了。"

"If it's that fast, what about a high powered projectile weapon?" Kensuke suggested, clapping his hands together. "That would hit much harder since the target is moving at such a high velocity."
如果它速度那么快，用高威力投射武器怎么样？" 健介提议道，双手一拍，"目标以如此高速移动，这样击中时的威力会更大。

Rei gave a single nod. "Perhaps, but projectiles have been shown to be almost entirely useless against an AT-Field."
绫波点了点头。“或许吧，但事实证明，弹丸对 AT 力场的效力几乎为零。”

Shinji blinked. Hadn't they already managed to break through an AT-Field with a ranged weapon? "What about the Positron Rifle?" he asked. "Could we use that to bring the AT-Field down first?"
真嗣眨了眨眼。他们不是已经用远程武器成功突破过 AT 力场吗？“那正电子步枪呢？”他问道，“我们能不能先用它来削弱 AT 力场？”

Asuka and Rei looked at him thoughtfully. "A good idea..." Asuka began.
明日香和绫波若有所思地看着他。“好主意……”明日香开口道。

"But it would take far too long," Rei continued. "It required several hours just to install the power systems for the Positron Rifle the last time it was deployed."
“但那太耗时了，”绫波接着说，“上次部署正电子步枪时，光是安装动力系统就花了好几个小时。”

"Wait, even if that was all sorted, it would still be a bad idea," said Kensuke. He began pacing, tapping the side of his head. "Say we somehow manage to knock the AT-Field down and destroy the core as the Angel's flying at us. What then?"
等等，即便这些问题都解决了，这仍然是个糟糕的主意，" 健介说道。他开始踱步，轻敲着自己的太阳穴。"假设我们设法削弱了 AT 力场并摧毁了天使的核心，而它正朝我们飞来。那接下来呢？

"Um..." Shinji scratched his head, then gave up and shrugged. "The Angel's dead and we're all fine?"
呃..." 真嗣挠了挠头，然后放弃似地耸了耸肩。"天使死了，我们都安然无恙？

Asuka suddenly gasped and slapped her forehead. "Damnit, he's right."
明日香突然倒吸一口凉气，猛地拍了下自己的额头。"该死，他说得对。"

"What?" Shinji turned a confused look on her. "What am I missing?"
什么？" 真嗣转向她，一脸困惑。"我漏掉了什么？

"The Angel is coming towards us at a high rate of speed," said Rei. "Killing it would not slow it down."
天使正以极快的速度向我们逼近，" 丽说道，"即使消灭它也无法减缓其速度。

"O-oh..." Shinji's face reddened as his mind caught up with the other pilots. "It'd... still hit the city."
哦...哦..." 真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕，他的思绪终于跟上了其他驾驶员。"它...还是会撞击城市。

Asuka nodded, but the sound of a door opening precluded any further conversation.
明日香点头，但此时开门声打断了任何进一步的对话。

Misato came out of the room, looking dead on her feet. She looked at the teenagers with tired eyes and said, "Guess you kids were trying to come up with something too, huh?"
美里从房间里走出来，一副筋疲力尽的样子。她用疲惫的眼神看着这些少年们，说道："看来你们这些孩子也在试图想出办法呢，对吧？"

"Hello Misato," greeted Shinji. "Yeah, but we couldn't come up with anything good."
你好，美里。" 真嗣打招呼道。"是啊，但我们也没想出什么好主意。

Leaning against the wall and running a hand through her hair, Misato sighed. "Problem is, we didn't either."
美里背靠墙壁，一手捋着头发，叹了口气。"问题在于，我们也没想出来。"

"What?!" Asuka exclaimed. "You telling me you geniuses wasted all that time for nothing?!"
什么？！" 明日香惊呼。"你是说你们这些天才白白浪费了那么多时间，一无所获？

"Not quite," Misato testily replied. "We did come up with a plan, but it's not what anybody would call a good plan. The MAGI are only giving it about a ten percent chance of success."
也不完全是，" 美里有些不耐烦地回答。"我们的确制定了一个计划，但那绝不是什么好计划。MAGI 给出的成功率只有大约百分之十。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Don't tell us the odds, tell us the plan! We're the ones that have to make it work, after all!"
明日香翻了个白眼。“别跟我们说概率，告诉我们计划！毕竟，执行计划的是我们！”

"Yeah," Kensuke piped up. "I don't know how the MAGI worked out those odds, but I'm sure they won't have given good odds for any other fight you've had before now. And yet you guys have managed to succeed every time."
“是啊，”健介插话道。“我不知道 MAGI 是怎么计算出那些概率的，但我敢肯定，你们之前经历的任何一场战斗，它给出的胜算都不高。然而你们每次都成功了。”

"Well thank you for the vote of confidence." Misato pushed off the wall. "Alright, the plan is actually pretty simple, on paper. You're going to catch the Angel."
“好吧，感谢你的信任票。”美里推开墙壁，站直身子。“其实，计划在纸面上相当简单。你们要做的就是捕捉那个使徒。”

Asuka blinked several times, putting her hands on her hips. "I'm sorry... what was that?"
明日香眨了好几下眼睛，双手叉腰。“不好意思……你刚说什么？”

"You're going to catch it," Misato repeated. When the teenagers continued to give her disbelieving looks, she sighed. "Look, just come with me; NERV's already preparing to enact the plan. "
你肯定会挨训的，" 葛城重复道。当少年们继续用怀疑的眼神看着她时，她叹了口气。"听着，跟我来吧；NERV 已经在准备执行计划了。

Several minutes of walking later, Misato and the pilots reached a catwalk overlooking a massive underground rail elevator, used for moving the Evangelions around. Unit-01, laying on its back on a train car, was sitting at a tunnel entrance as Unit-00 came up the elevator next. Doctor Akagi was already there, overseeing the operation from a computer console on the catwalk.
走了几分钟后，葛城和驾驶员们来到了一个俯瞰巨大地下轨道电梯的步道上，这个电梯用于移动福音战士。零号机正躺在平板车上，位于隧道入口处，而初号机则随着电梯上升，紧随其后。赤木博士已经在那里，从步道上的电脑控制台监督着整个操作。

"Pilots," was all she said by way of greeting. "I take it you're not sure how everything is going to happen?"
驾驶员们，" 她以此作为问候。"我想你们还不清楚接下来会发生什么吧？

"No, ma'am," Kensuke replied. "We'd appreciate a full briefing before getting sent out."
是的，女士，" 洞木回答。"在出发前，我们希望能得到一个详细的简报。

"Understandable." She typed away at the keyboard, and the screen changed to show a map of the area. "The Angel has entered the atmosphere, and it isn't coming at us in a straight line anymore. As a result, we no longer know its exact point of impact so we can't send you all to a single location to catch it. Even if it hits outside of Tokyo-3 the kinetic energy would blast away most of the greater Hakone region, possibly even resulting in it turning into just another part of the Pacific Ocean."
可以理解。"她敲击着键盘，屏幕随即切换显示该区域的地图。"使者已进入大气层，且不再沿直线朝我们而来。因此，我们无法确定其精确撞击点，也就不能将你们送往单一地点拦截。即便它落在东京-3 区外，其动能也足以摧毁大部分箱根地区，甚至可能使其沦为太平洋的一部分。

More typing, and another screen change. "The plan is to split you up, sending you to three points of a triangle bordering the projected impact zone. The weather outside has turned nasty, with heavy rain and cloud cover blocking any visual of the Angel from the ground. You-" Doctor Akagi glanced at Asuka and Shinji, waggling a hand, "-uh... three-and-a-half, will have to locate the Angel yourselves. Whoever reaches the point of impact first will need to catch the Angel with their AT-Field, while the others attack it."
继续敲击键盘，屏幕再次变换。"计划是将你们分散部署，派往预计撞击区周边构成三角形的三个点。外面天气变得恶劣，大雨和云层遮挡了地面观察使者的视线。你们——"赤木博士瞥了瞥明日香和真嗣，摆了摆手，"——呃...三个半，得自行定位使者。谁先到达撞击点，就要用 AT 场捕捉使者，而其他人则发起攻击。"

Asuka tore her eyes away from the screen, rubbing them with a thumb and forefinger. "You're basically hoping that AT-Field physics bullshit will let us catch what is essentially a kinetic kill vehicle, aren't you?"
明日香将目光从屏幕上移开，用拇指和食指揉了揉眼睛。“你基本上是希望 AT 力场的物理学胡扯能让我们捕捉到本质上就是动能杀伤载具的东西，对吧？”

Doctor Akagi nodded. "As much as it pains me to admit it, this is the only plan we have that has any chance to work. That being said, however, it's still a long shot whether we'll even be alive tomorrow. There's..." She looked away slightly, putting a hand over her mouth in thought, before turning back to them. "We still have time before you're needed in your Evas. If you'd like to write a will in case of... you know..."
赤木博士点了点头。“尽管承认这一点让我很痛苦，但这是我们唯一有希望成功的计划。即便如此，我们明天是否还能活着，仍然是个未知数。有……”她微微转过头，用手捂住嘴沉思，然后又转向他们。“在你们需要进入 EVA 之前，我们还有时间。如果你们想写遗嘱以防万一……你们知道的……”

The four teenagers looked at each other. Down below, Unit-00's train car was stationary and Unit-02 was now coming up the elevator.
四个少年少女相互对视。下方，零号机的列车车厢静止不动，二号机正通过电梯上升。

"That will not be necessary," Rei quietly stated, looking back at Doctor Akagi. "The Angels must be defeated. We must succeed, therefore we will succeed."
“那没有必要，”绫波平静地说道，目光回望赤木博士。“必须击败使徒。我们必须成功，因此我们将会成功。”

"Well said, Ayanami!" Kensuke stepped up next to Rei and grinned, clenching a fist in front of him. "Who needs a will? We're gonna come through this just fine!"
说得好，绫波！" 健介走到零身边，咧嘴一笑，紧握拳头置于胸前。"要什么遗嘱？我们一定能安然度过！

Asuka moved up on the other side of Rei. "Yeah, we've kicked the ass of every Angel that's come our way so far! This one'll be no different!"
明日香从另一侧靠近零。"没错，迄今为止，我们已击败了所有来袭的使徒！这次也不会例外！"

Shinji was right behind her. "We can't go in thinking we won't survive. I'd rather think about what will happen after we win again."
真嗣紧随其后。"我们不能抱着无法生还的心态进去。我宁愿去想胜利后会发生什么。"

Startled by the response of her teammates, Rei blushed slightly in embarrassment at being the centre of attention.
队友们的回应让零有些吃惊，她因成为焦点而略显羞涩地脸红了。

"Well said, kids!" Misato cheered, before directing a smirk at Doctor Akagi. "See, I told you this was a good plan!"
说得好，孩子们！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷欢呼道，随后向赤木博士投去一个得意的微笑。"看吧，我就说这是个好主意！

With a roll of her eyes, the scientist drily replied, "If only the MAGI had taken enthusiasm into account. I'm sure they would have given us better odds."
赤木博士翻了个白眼，干巴巴地回应："要是 MAGI 把热情也算作考量因素就好了。我敢肯定，那样我们的胜算会更高。"

"Hah. Anyway, speaking of afterwards, I reckon NERV will be happy to spring for a nice celebratory dinner when our winners come back. Isn't that right, Rits?" Misato turned an expectant look on her friend.
"哈。话说回来，提到庆功宴，我猜 NERV 会很乐意为凯旋的胜利者们办一场丰盛的庆祝晚宴。对吧，律子？" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷满怀期待地看向她的朋友。

"Fine," Doctor Akagi sighed. "Then how about this: Come back alive and I'll treat us all." She glanced at Misato and shrugged. "Easier than trying to wrangle money out of the damn accounting department."
好吧，" 赤木博士叹了口气。"那这样如何：只要你们平安归来，我就请大家吃饭。" 她瞥了一眼惣流·明日香·兰格雷，耸了耸肩。"总比从那该死的财务部抠钱来得容易。

"Tell me about it," Misato muttered, before a klaxon sounded. She looked down below at the Evangelions, to see that they were all in position in front of a train tunnel. "Right, get to your Evas, kids, and I'll see you when you return. That's a promise."
跟我说说吧，" 葛城低声说道，紧接着警报响起。她低头看向下方的 EVA，只见它们都已就位在铁路隧道前。"好了，快去你们的 EVA 那里，孩子们，等你们回来再见。这是约定。

XXX

Shinji stared at the landscape around him. All three Evangelions had been deployed; now there were just final checks to be completed while the batteries were getting topped up. The rain was coming down hard, and the thick grey storm clouds were practically turning day into night. Shinji's mind was wandering as he and Asuka waited for the go signal, and for some reason it decided to wander all the way over to his mother.
真嗣环顾四周的景象。三台 EVA 都已部署完毕；现在只剩下最后的检查工作，同时电池也在充电中。雨势很大，厚重的灰色雷雨云几乎将白昼变成了黑夜。真嗣和明日香等待着出发信号，他的思绪开始游离，不知为何，它飘向了自己的母亲。

Something about sitting in Unit-01 always brought him a measure of comfort, whether in the heat of battle or just during training. He wasn't sure what was causing it, since piloting Unit-02 didn't give him the same feeling. The only thing he could think of that was familiar was-
不知为何，坐在初号机里总能给他带来一丝安慰，无论是在激战中还是仅仅在训练时。他不确定是什么原因，因为驾驶二号机并没有给他同样的感觉。他唯一能想到的熟悉之处是——

"Hey Shinji, everything okay?"
嘿，真嗣，一切都还好吗？

Oh, apparently something was getting through the neural link to his co-pilot. He was sitting in front of her, so there was no way Asuka could have noticed otherwise. Thankfully, that did mean she wouldn't notice his face reddening slightly in embarrassment.
哦，显然有什么东西通过神经链接传到了他的副驾驶那里。他坐在她前面，所以除非通过这种方式，否则明日香是不可能注意到的。幸好，这也意味着她不会看到他脸上微微泛起的红晕。

"It's... nothing," he said, trying to head the conversation off at the pass.
“这...没什么，”他试图在对话开始前就将其打断。

It didn't work. He could feel her disapproval. Without turning around he knew that Asuka's arms would be folded. "Please don't try and lie to me. Especially when we're in here."
但并未奏效。他能感受到她的不满。尽管没有回头，他知道明日香此刻一定是双臂交叉。“请不要试图对我撒谎。尤其是在我们身处这里的时候。”

"What?" Shinji twisted in his seat to look back up at her. "You can somehow tell I'm lying through the neural link?"
“什么？”真嗣在座位上扭动身体，回头看向她。“你能通过神经链接察觉到我在撒谎？”

Asuka waggled a hand. "Not really, but I definitely felt something through the link just now. And since we've still got a couple minutes, spill it."
明日香摆了摆手，“倒也不是，但刚才通过链接我确实感觉到了什么。既然我们还有几分钟时间，你就说出来吧。”

"Oh, fine," Shinji sighed, turning in his seat to stare out of the plug at their surroundings. It still amazed him that, despite being inside a metal tube inside a giant robot, it was as if he was simply sitting in a windowed room. There were people and vehicles nearby, and the Evangelion's sight had such clarity that, even with the heavy rain, he could make out the number plates on the vehicles as if he were standing out in the open. "It really was nothing important. I was just... thinking about my mother." He silently tried to will the incoming conversation away, but to no avail.
“唉，好吧，”真嗣叹了口气，转过身来，透过插入栓的窗口望向四周。他仍然惊讶于，尽管身处巨型机器人体内的金属管中，却仿佛只是坐在一个有窗的房间里。附近有人和车辆，而初号机的视野如此清晰，即使在大雨中，他也能像站在户外一样看清车辆的牌照。“其实真的没什么重要的。我只是……在想我的母亲。”他默默地试图让即将到来的对话消失，但无济于事。

"Ah." Asuka nodded and unfolded her arms, placing them behind her head as she leaned back in her seat. "Is... uh... everything alright there? Can't help but notice you never talked about your parents in our letters to each other. To be fair, neither did I, but... I mean, now I know who your old man is, but whe-"
“啊。”明日香点了点头，双臂展开，枕在脑后，身体向后靠在座位上。“那……呃……一切都还好吗？我注意到你在给彼此的信中从未提及过父母。说来公平，我也没提过，但……我的意思是，现在我知道你父亲是谁了，可是……”

"She's gone..." “她已经不在了……”

-re's... oh..." Now Shinji could feel something through the neural link. He wasn't going to bring it up though, seeing as he already knew exactly what it was. "...Sorry."
-re's... 哦..." 此刻，真嗣通过神经链接感受到了某种东西。不过，他并不打算提及，因为他已经完全明白那是什么。"...抱歉。

Hearing that word, the one he'd used so often that people had started to admonish him for it, irked him slightly. Especially since Asuka was doing his thing of apologising unnecessarily. "Don't ap-" he began, before something cut him off.
听到那个词，那个他频繁使用以至于人们开始责备他的词，他感到有些不悦。尤其是当明日香在做他常做的无谓道歉时。"别道-" 他刚开口，却被什么打断了。

"Get into positions," came the order from Misato.
"各就各位，" 美里下达了命令。

"...Talk later?" Asuka awkwardly suggested.
"...待会儿再聊？" 明日香尴尬地提议道。

Shinji nodded but said nothing, setting his attention on Unit-01 as it leaned forward to place its massive purple hands on the ground like it was a runner at a starting block. The people down on the ground hurried to evacuate the area, leaving the vehicles behind.
真嗣点了点头，却未发一言，他的目光紧锁在初号机上，它向前倾身，巨大的紫色双手撑地，宛如起跑线上的赛跑者。地面的人群急忙撤离该区域，遗弃了车辆。

"With bad sensor data and worse weather, we're not exactly in the best position to be giving direct orders," said Misato. "This will be all up to you kids, but we'll still give what support we can. Now make us proud! Release the locks!"
传感器数据不佳，天气更是恶劣，我们并非处于下达直接命令的最佳位置，" 美里说道，"这将全靠你们这些孩子了，但我们仍会尽力提供支援。现在，让我们为你们骄傲！解除锁定！

The power cable exploded away from Unit-01's back, and its feet scrabbled for purchase in the mud as it shot forward. The tremors from every step rattled the nearby vehicles as the Evangelion found its footing, knocking some over as it stormed past them and onto the main street of a nearby town. Buildings flashed by as Shinji strained to push Unit-01 to its limits while also keeping in step with Asuka.
初号机背后的电源线爆炸般脱离，它的双脚在泥泞中寻找支撑，随即猛冲而出。每一步的震动都使附近的车辆摇晃，有些甚至被撞翻，当它冲过并进入附近城镇的主街时。建筑物在眼前飞速掠过，真嗣竭力推动初号机达到极限，同时紧跟阿苏卡的步伐。

There were rows of power lines in the way, and Unit-01 practically flew as it hurdled them, sometimes passing over two or three at a time. While it was perfectly fine to simply charge straight through any smaller obstacles such as walkways, it just wasn't worth the risk of getting tangled up in a cable and losing precious seconds.
前方是一排排的电线，零号机几乎是在飞跃它们，有时一次越过两三根。对于较小的障碍物，如人行道，直接冲过去倒也无妨，但被电缆缠住而浪费宝贵时间的风险实在不值得。

Then, with one final leap that shattered the road under its feet, Unit-01 crested a cliff and took to the air once more, soaring over the edge and dropping into the valley below. It landed in a small group of trees in the middle of a field of rice paddies, the impact hard enough to send waves rippling along their surfaces. But there was no time to admire the scenery; Unit-01 stormed onward towards the edge of another town.
随后，零号机以一跃之力踏碎脚下的路面，翻越悬崖再次腾空而起，飞越边缘坠入下方的山谷。它落在一片稻田中央的小树林中，着陆的冲击力使得稻田水面泛起阵阵涟漪。然而，无暇欣赏风景，零号机继续向另一座城镇的边缘疾驰而去。

"How are we supposed to catch a falling Angel when we can't even see it?!" Kensuke groused over the comm system. "By the time it breaks through the clouds we'll likely be too far away to catch it!"
我们连天使的影子都看不见，怎么去捕捉坠落的天使呢？！" 健介通过通讯系统抱怨道。"等它穿透云层时，我们恐怕已经离得太远，追不上了！

Unit-01's head raised up as Shinji and Asuka scanned the clouds. Flickers of lightning constantly illuminated them, but Shinji still couldn't see anything.
零号机抬头望向云层，真嗣和明日香在搜寻着。闪电不时照亮云层，但真嗣仍旧什么也看不见。

"Command, I need the MAGI for something, quickly!" Asuka shouted. "What area is having the most amount of lighting strikes?"
指挥中心，我需要 MAGI 处理点事，快点！" 明日香大声喊道。"哪个区域雷击最多？

"I... what?" Misato stammered. Fortunately it seemed somebody else understood what Asuka was getting at.
"我...什么？" 美里结巴着说。幸好似乎有人明白了明日香的意图。

"Understood!" said Doctor Akagi. There was a few seconds of tapping, and then she returned with, "Sector 7G is showing the most strikes. MAGI are now giving a 98% chance of the Angel emerging from the clouds at that location!"
明白！" 赤木博士回应道。几秒钟的敲击声后，她回报道："7G 区域显示雷击最多。MAGI 现在给出 98%的概率，天使将从该位置的云层中出现！

Shinji had no idea what any of that talk of lightning meant; he instead took the time to check the map. "7G... that's in the middle of Kensuke's zone!" he exclaimed. That spot was far off to their left, and there was still a lot of town left to traverse through with no streets big enough to fit a speeding Evangelion down them without hitting every building along the way.
真嗣对那些关于雷电的讨论一头雾水；他趁机查看地图。"7G...那不是在健介的区域中心吗！" 他惊呼。那个位置在他们左方很远，而且还有大片城镇要穿越，没有足够宽阔的街道能让高速行驶的福音战士通过而不撞上沿途的每一栋建筑。

"Adjusting course!" came Kensuke's response.
"调整航向！"传来健介的回应。

"We're picking up a change in the Angel's AT-Field!" came the call from Lieutenant Aoba. "It's morphing and... it's accelerating!"
检测到使徒的 AT 力场发生变化！"来自青叶中尉的呼叫，"它在变形，而且……正在加速！

"New ETA is thirty-eight seconds!"
新的预计到达时间是三十八秒！

"I'll be there in thirty!" replied Kensuke.
"我三十秒内赶到！"健介回答道。

Asuka swore a spiky oath. "We're too far out to catch it, and we're on the wrong side of this town! And I don't know if Glasses will be able to hold it long enough!"
明日香发出了尖锐的誓言。“我们离得太远了，抓不到它，而且我们在这个镇的错误一边！我不知道眼镜能不能坚持住那么久！”

"But we're already going as fast as we can!" Shinji said over his shoulder. "Especially with all these damn buildings in our way!"
“但我们已经尽力在跑了！” 真嗣回头喊道。“尤其是这些该死的建筑挡在前面！”

"There's a highway big enough for you at this location!" Hyuga said as a dot appeared on the map in front of Shinji. "It's a hard left turn though, so you'll need to practically stop to make it!"
“这个地方有一条足够你行驶的高速公路！” 日向说着，地图上出现了一个点。“不过是个急左转，你得几乎停下来才能拐过去！”

"Stop?!" Asuka echoed in disgust. "Fuck that!"
“停下来？！” 明日香厌恶地重复道。“去他的！”

Unit-01 dropped, sliding feet first along the ground like a skyscraper-sized baseball player, tearing up huge chunks of pavement that slammed into the buildings on either side of them. The turn came up, and the Evangelion's left hand latched onto a sturdy-looking building on the corner. The building held up just long enough for Unit-01 to swing around onto the highway and back up onto its feet, before the over-stressed structure collapsed behind them.
初号机坠落，双脚先着地，如同摩天大楼般高大的棒球运动员滑行在地面上，撕裂出大块的路面，撞击着两侧的建筑物。转弯处到了，使徒的左手紧紧抓住拐角处一座看似坚固的建筑。那建筑勉强支撑到初号机借力一转，跃上高速公路并重新站稳，随后便因过度受力而坍塌在他们身后。

"Still not fast enough," Shinji groaned frustratedly. While he didn't want to put Kensuke down, he silently agreed with Asuka that their friend was just too new for such an onerous task as catching a falling Angel.
“还是不够快。” 真嗣懊恼地嘟囔着。尽管他不想贬低健介，但内心默默同意明日香的观点，认为他们的朋友对于捕捉坠落中的使徒这项艰巨任务来说，还是太缺乏经验了。

"Then let's go faster!" Asuka shouted down at him. Gritting his teeth and growling, Shinji refrained from sniping back and redoubled his efforts.
“那就再快点！” 明日香冲着他喊道。真嗣咬紧牙关，低吼一声，忍住反驳的冲动，加倍努力提速。

Buildings were now flashing by so fast that they appeared as a single solid object. There was a mountain up ahead; Shinji blinked, and suddenly he was at the top of it. Off in the distance, he could see Unit-02 thundering towards them. Somebody swore in surprise through the comm system.
建筑物飞速掠过，快得仿佛连成了一堵实墙。前方出现了一座山；真嗣眨眼间，已置身山顶。远处，他看到零号机正轰鸣着向他们奔来。通讯系统中有人惊讶地咒骂了一声。

"There! I see it!" 看！我看见了！

Up above, a spindly object broke through the cloud cover with a roar like an oversized jet engine. It looked like a rainbow-coloured version of the eye symbols that had been covering the black orb, only with two massive sets of similarly-colourful wings that trailed red smoke behind them. What appeared to be hundreds of black humanoid figures, each with the familiar eye symbol on its chest, lined every edge of its body. As it drew closer, Shinji gasped at the size; the Angel looked truly gargantuan, as big as Tokyo-3 itself if not larger.
上方，一个细长的物体伴随着巨型喷气引擎般的轰鸣声穿透云层。它看起来像是覆盖在黑色球体上的眼睛符号的彩虹色版本，只是多了两对同样色彩斑斓的巨大翅膀，后面拖着红色的烟雾。在其身体的每一侧，排列着数百个黑色人形生物，每个胸前都有熟悉的眼睛符号。随着它逐渐逼近，真嗣惊叹于其尺寸；这使徒确实庞大无比，堪比整个第三新东京市，甚至更大。

"Now we need to stop!" said Asuka, with a hint of a smirk in her voice. Debris kicked up as Unit-01 slid for over a kilometre, coming to a stop under the central 'eye' of the Angel.
"现在我们必须停下！"明日香说道，声音中带着一丝得意的笑意。零号机滑行了超过一公里，激起一片碎屑，最终在使徒中央的"眼睛"下方停住。

"This is all you now, Asuka," said Shinji as he stared up at the approaching Angel. Its eye alone was already dwarfing the Evangelion. The word 'giant' just got a new meaning. "I can't do anything more at this point."
接下来就看你的了，明日香，"真嗣抬头望着逼近的使徒说道。光是那只眼睛就已经让福音战士相形见绌。"巨人"这个词有了全新的含义。"此时此刻，我已无能为力。

"Got no time for self-pity!" Behind him, Asuka rubbed her hands together. Suddenly, she was speaking German. "Na dann: AT Feld volle Kraft!"
没时间自怨自艾了！" 在他身后，明日香搓着手。突然，她开始说德语："那么：AT 力场全开！

The world turned purple. 世界变成了紫色。

Unit-01's AT-Field shimmered for a second before vanishing again; a shockwave tearing up the ground around Unit-01. It raised its hands skyward, towards the glowing white dot at the very centre of the Angel. The AT-Field flared back into visibility as it contacted the Angel's own barrier, glowing hexagons radiating out from a point between its hands to match the rings of light flowing across the surface of the Angel's body. The ground cracked under Unit-01's feet, and Asuka groaned under the strain of halting the Angel, the sound making Shinji's chest twinge. The best he could do now was keep an eye open for any surprises. And speaking of which...
初号机的 AT 力场闪烁了一瞬后再次消失；一股冲击波撕裂了初号机周围的地面。它举起双手，朝向天使中心那颗闪耀的白点。当接触到天使自身的屏障时，AT 力场重新显现，从其双手间的一点向四周辐射出六边形光芒，与天使体表流动的光环相匹配。地面在初号机脚下裂开，明日香在阻止天使的压力下呻吟，声音让真嗣的胸口一阵紧缩。他现在能做的，就是保持警惕，以防任何意外。说到意外...

Was there a reflective surface up on the Angel's body? He could see something that looked like a shadowy Evangelion. Whatever it was, it seemed to unfold itself, stretching out lanky arms to its own side of the colliding AT-Fields. Shinji saw a face -or possibly a mask on its face- that looked remarkably similar to the horned visage of Unit-01, only with glowing red eyes.
天使的身上有反射面吗？他看到似乎有一个阴影般的福音战士。无论那是什么，它似乎展开了自己，伸出细长的手臂伸向碰撞的 AT 力场另一侧。真嗣看到了一张脸——或者可能是脸上的面具——与初号机那长角的面部惊人地相似，只是眼睛闪烁着红光。

"What the hell..." Shinji breathed. The white circle had reformed into a hollow ring encircling a fleshy mass that the smaller body of the Angel seemed to be growing from. The form wavered then solidified, becoming an almost exact replica of Unit-01, only instead of the clean purple-and-green colour scheme, it was tinted the ugly purple of bruised flesh.
"这到底是什么鬼..." 真嗣喘息着。那白色的圆圈重新组合成一个空心的环，环绕着一个肉质的团块，天使较小的身体似乎正从中生长出来。形态摇摆不定，随后凝固，变成了几乎与零号机一模一样的复制品，只是颜色不再是干净的紫绿相间，而是呈现出一种受伤肌肤般的丑陋紫色。

The thing's hands pushed into and through the clashing AT-Fields, eliciting gasps of surprise from Shinji and Asuka. Its hands clasped onto those of Unit-01 in an almost gentle manner; Shinji barely had time to ponder what it was doing before his hands exploded in agony.
那东西的手穿透了碰撞中的 AT 力场，让真嗣和明日香惊讶地倒吸一口凉气。它的手以一种近乎温柔的方式握住了零号机的手；真嗣还来不及思考它要做什么，他的手就爆发出剧烈的痛苦。

"Gyaaaahhhhh!" 啊啊啊啊啊！

Twinned screams of agony burst forth from Shinji and Asuka's mouths. The thing had morphed its hands and arms into drills, spearing directly through Unit-01's hands and continuing on to tunnel into the ground. The LCL in the entry plug boiled around the glowing spots on Shinji's hands, creating columns of bubbles, but he was in too much agony to pay attention to such minor details.
真嗣和明日香口中同时爆发出痛苦的尖叫。那东西已经将它的手和手臂变形为钻头，直接穿透了零号机的手，并继续钻入地面。插入栓内的 LCL 在真嗣手上发光的部位沸腾，形成了一串串气泡柱，但他痛苦至极，根本无暇顾及这些微不足道的细节。

"Geh, wanna play... rough, huh?!" Asuka snarled through her pain.
"哼，想玩...硬的，是吧？！" 明日香忍痛咆哮道。

Struggling to concentrate through the pain, Shinji opened one eye and glared up at the mockery of an Evangelion above them. As best as he could, he forced Unit-01's fingers to latch on to the drills and willed the Evangelion to push back.
忍着痛楚努力集中精神，真嗣睁开一只眼，怒视着上方那具扭曲的使徒。他竭尽全力，让初号机的手指紧紧抓住钻头，并驱动使徒奋力抵抗。

"Aida, why have you stopped short?" Rei's terse voice just barely cut through the noise to reach Shinji's ears.
"相田，你怎么停下了？" 零那简短的声音勉强穿透噪音，传入真嗣耳中。

"Wha- oh shit!" Kensuke shouted in response. "Be there in a couple seconds!" In fact he was there right as he finished talking, Unit-02 skidding to a stop to the left of Unit-01. "Where's the core?" he asked.
"什——哦，该死！" 健介大声回应。"马上到！" 果然，他话音刚落，二号机便滑行至初号机左侧停下。"核心在哪？" 他问道。

Through gritted teeth, Asuka said, "I think I can... see it on the... edge of that ring!"
咬紧牙关，明日香说道：“我觉得我可以看到……它在那个环的……边缘！”

Unit-02's head turned side to side, before focusing on a specific point. "There it is!" Its left pylon opened up for it to grab the Progressive Knife stored there. Pushing through the AT-Field, the red Evangelion aimed at and stabbed the knife towards the familiar red orb that was the Angel's core.
二号机的头部左右转动，然后聚焦于某一点。“找到了！”它的左臂展开，准备取出储存在那里的高振动刀。穿过 A.T.力场，红色的福音战士瞄准并刺向那个熟悉的红色球体——天使的核心。

The Angel, clearly deciding not to make things easy, shifted its core, spinning it at high speed around the ring. When Kensuke tried again to stab it, the slight miscalculation resulted in the knife being knocked out of Unit-02's hands. He swore in frustration. The spike launcher in Unit-02's right shoulder also failed to connect.
显然，天使并不打算让事情变得简单，它移动了核心，使其在环上高速旋转。当健介再次尝试刺击时，微小的计算失误导致刀从二号机手中脱落。他懊恼地咒骂了一声。二号机右肩上的尖刺发射器也未能命中目标。

"Hurry up!" Asuka shouted. "I can't... keep this up... forever!"
“快点！”明日香喊道。“我不能……永远这样……坚持下去！”

"Grab onto it!" Rei ordered as Unit-00 arrived next to Unit-02, a knife in both hands.
"抓住它！" 零命令道，此时零号机手持双刀来到二号机旁。

As Unit-02 reached a red hand up to the ring, the core slapped loudly into it, halting it just long enough for Kensuke to grab on with both hands. Unit-00 lashed out with its knives, the first one putting a sizeable crack in the core and the second one widening the gap. After straining for a moment to shatter the core through sheer leverage, Rei abandoned the tactic upon hearing more grunts of pain from Shinji and Asuka. Instead, Unit-00's head reared back and slammed forward, headbutting the knife handles and forcing them into the red orb.
当二号机伸出红色手掌触碰到环状物时，核心猛地撞击上去，使其停顿片刻，足够让健介双手紧握。零号机挥舞着刀刃，第一刀在核心上留下一道明显的裂痕，第二刀则扩大了裂口。在试图仅凭杠杆力破坏核心片刻后，听到真嗣和明日香痛苦的呻吟声，零放弃了这一策略。取而代之的是，零号机向后仰头，然后猛地向前撞击，用头部撞击刀柄，迫使它们深入红色球体。

The core shattered. 核心碎裂了。

The Angel's AT-Field disappeared, leaving Asuka gasping for breath. Its expansive wings fell almost gently to earth, the humanoid tendrils that lined its body slumping over before suddenly curling up, starting at the edges and working their way towards the central body. Just as it seemed as if it was all over, the mock-Evangelion exploded into blood, completely coating Unit-01.
使徒的 AT 力场消失，留下明日香喘息不已。它那宽阔的翅膀几乎轻柔地坠向地面，遍布其身躯的人形触须先是垂落，随后突然卷曲起来，从边缘开始，逐渐向中央躯体蔓延。就在一切似乎即将结束之际，那仿造的福音机轰然爆炸，血浆彻底覆盖了初号机。

Through the sludge dripping down the 'screens', Shinji could see that the entire landscape had suddenly been painted red; the blood that was all that was left of the Angel flooding downhill towards one of the districts they had just saved like the most disgusting tidal wave he would ever have the displeasure of witnessing. Already he could see buildings being knocked over by the sheer force of the liquid's passage; even the tallest buildings in the town that withstood the initial surge were now almost completely submerged.
透过滴落的泥浆，真嗣看到整个景象突然被染成了红色；天使留下的血迹如洪水般顺着山坡涌向他们刚刚拯救的一个区域，形成了一波他极不情愿目睹的最恶心的潮涌。他已能看到建筑物被这股液体的强大力量冲倒；即使是镇上最高的建筑，在最初的冲击中幸存下来，现在也几乎完全被淹没。

Clutching his aching hands, Shinji breathed heavily as Unit-01 ran out of main power, leaving the entry plug dark, each gasp mirrored by Asuka behind him. The spots on his hands were still glowing and bubbling; an exploratory poke with one finger revealed that the circles were hot, and that he shouldn't have done that as a jolt of agony ran up his arm.
紧握着疼痛的双手，真嗣在零号机主电源耗尽、插入栓内陷入黑暗时，急促地呼吸着，每一次喘息都与身后的明日香同步。他手上的斑点仍在发光冒泡；用一根手指试探性地触碰，发现那些圆圈异常灼热，而这一举动立即引发了一阵剧痛沿着手臂窜升。

"Fuck," Asuka finally managed to say. "That's using your head, Wondergirl."
该死，"明日香终于开口说道，"你还真会动脑筋，奇迹少女。

Despite the pain in his hands, Shinji managed to let out a chuckle. Kensuke snorted through the comm system, but Rei remained stoic. However, he thought he could hear some satisfaction in her voice as she replied, "I had no more weapons available to me. This seemed like the most expedient option."
尽管双手疼痛，真嗣还是勉强笑了出来。通讯系统中，剑介哼了一声，而绫波则依旧面无表情。然而，他觉得在她回答时，声音中似乎带着一丝满足：“我已经没有可用的武器了。这似乎是最快捷的选择。”

Any further conversation was cut off by the sound of cheering from the command centre, interspersed with more subdued remarks of praise from Misato and Doctor Akagi. The cheering soon came to an abrupt halt.
指挥中心的欢呼声打断了任何进一步的交谈，其间夹杂着美里和赤木博士更为克制的赞许之词。欢呼声不久便戛然而止。

"Incoming communication from Commander Ikari."
收到来自碇司令的通讯。

The comm channel to command went silent for a minute, before coming back with, "Unit-01, Commander Ikari wants to speak with you two."
与指挥中心的通讯频道静默了一分钟，随后传来消息：“初号机，碇司令要和你们两位通话。”

Before Shinji or Asuka could respond, a screen flashed to life in front of their faces, mostly taken up by the words 'SOUND ONLY'.
在真嗣或明日香来得及回应之前，一个屏幕在他们面前闪现，大部分被“仅音频”的字样占据。

"Captain Katsuragi has just informed me of what happened." His father's voice sounded just as neutral as ever. "The two of you performed incredibly well considering the circumstances."
“葛城上尉刚刚向我汇报了情况。”他父亲的声音一如既往地平淡。“考虑到情况，你们俩表现得非常出色。”

"Thank you sir," said Asuka. Shinji echoed her, but couldn't stop a hiss of pain escaping his lips.
“谢谢您，先生，”明日香说道。真嗣也跟着回应，但忍不住发出了一声痛苦的嘶声。

"...Shinji? Are you injured?" There was just the barest hint of concern, so faint that Shinji couldn't be sure he wasn't imagining things.
“……真嗣？你受伤了吗？”那关切之意微乎其微，以至于真嗣无法确定自己是否在臆想。

"It's just sympathetic pain, sir," Asuka replied for him. "That Angel impaled our Eva through both hands and we're still feeling it."
这只是共感痛楚，先生，"明日香替他回答道，"那个使徒穿透了我们 Eva 的双手，我们现在还能感受到。

"I see. Considering the likelihood of the two of you achieving an extraordinarily high sync ratio, you will report to medical as soon as you are able."
我明白了。鉴于你们两人同步率可能异常高，请尽快前往医疗部门报告。

"Yes sir," he and Asuka said in sync.
"是，先生，"他和明日香异口同声地回答。

"Hrm." That was clearly all the goodbye he would get from his father; the voices of Doctor Akagi and the bridge officers returned as they sent out retrieval orders for the Evangelions, with priority given to Unit-01.
"嗯。"这显然是他从父亲那里得到的全部告别；赤木博士和指挥室军官们的声音再次响起，他们下达了回收 Eva 机体的命令，优先处理零号机。

With a grunt, a pair of red arms flopped down in Shinji's peripheral vision. He turned around to see Asuka slumped over the back of his seat, her head resting on an arm. When she saw him looking at her, she half-heartedly raised her hands a tiny fraction of an inch. "Think we've actually got holes in our own hands now?" she asked.
伴随着一声闷哼，一双红色的手臂无力地垂落在真嗣的余光中。他转过身，看到明日香趴在他座位后面，头靠在手臂上。当她发现他在看她时，她半心半意地微微抬了抬手。“你觉得我们手上现在真的有洞了吗？”她问道。

Looking down at his own gloved hands, Shinji saw that the glowing spots were almost completely faded. "I'm... sure we'll be fine," he said with a modicum of uncertainty, staring at the blankness in front of him. "With that safety system in place, we didn't get over a hundred percent sync each, right?"
真嗣低头看着自己戴着手套的双手，发现那些发光的地方几乎完全消失了。“我……相信我们会没事的，”他带着一丝不确定说道，目光凝视着前方的空白。“有了那个安全系统，我们每个人的同步率没有超过百分之一百，对吧？”

Asuka blew a raspberry. "They should have just disabled the damn thing. We were only a second away from losing power when the Angel died."
明日香不屑地哼了一声。“他们真该直接把那玩意儿关掉。天使死的时候，我们离失去动力只差一秒。”

"That wouldn't have mattered, really," Shinji replied. "All three Evas seemed to lose power at the same time."
“其实那并不重要，”真嗣回答道。“三台 Eva 似乎同时失去了动力。”

"Yeah, true I guess. Anyway..." One of Asuka's hands tapped his shoulder, which she seemed to immediately regret given the tiny 'ow' she let out. "Sorry about dredging up your mum before."
嗯，确实，我想是的。不管怎样……" 明日香的一只手轻拍了他的肩膀，随即似乎因为发出的微弱"哎呦"声而后悔。"抱歉，刚才提到了你妈妈。

"...It's fine." ...没事。

"Can I, uh, let you in on a little secret?"
我，呃，能告诉你一个小秘密吗？

"Huh? Sure, I guess." When Asuka didn't immediately respond, Shinji twisted in his seat to see that she was staring off into space. "...Asuka?"
啊？当然，我想可以。" 当明日香没有立刻回应时，真嗣扭动身子，看到她正凝视着虚空。"...明日香？

"My mum's... gone too," the girl muttered dully. "She... died when I was young."
我妈妈也...走了，"女孩无精打采地嘟囔着，"她...在我很小的时候就去世了。

Shinji's heart twinged, and he slammed his mouth shut before he could let out a reflexive apology, pausing to actually think about what to say. "I still mean what I said back in that corridor," he finally said. "If you ever wanna talk about... things, I'll give you my full attention."
真嗣心头一紧，急忙闭上嘴巴，阻止了自己本能的道歉脱口而出，他停顿下来，认真思考着该说什么。"我还是那句话，就像之前在走廊里说的，"他最终开口道，"如果你想谈...谈那些事，我会全神贯注地听你讲。"

"Yeah, I still remember." Asuka patted his shoulder, and Shinji pretended not to notice her wincing at the obviously painful action. A metallic thunk echoed through the plug, and Asuka looked back towards the entrance. "Guess the cleanup crew's finally arrived," she remarked as the entry plug began the ejection sequence.
"嗯，我还记得。"明日香拍了拍他的肩膀，而真嗣装作没注意到她因明显疼痛而皱眉的动作。一声金属撞击的回响在插入栓内回荡，明日香回头望向入口处。"看来清理小组终于到了，"她评论道，此时插入栓开始启动弹出程序。

Harsh light reached their dark-adjusted eyes. The storm had broken, and the clouds were starting to disperse. A weak sun shone its light on the red landscape surrounding them as Asuka and Shinji were helped down to ground level and onto a NERV transport aircraft. Rei and Kensuke joined them a couple minutes later, and the VTOL took to the sky.
刺眼的光线照进了他们已经适应黑暗的眼睛。暴风雨已经过去，云层开始散开。微弱的阳光照耀着周围红色的地貌，当明日香和真嗣被搀扶到地面并登上 NERV 的运输机时。几分钟后，绫波和剑介也加入了他们，垂直起降飞机随即升空。

Rei stared out the aircraft's window, directing a grimace at the blood-drenched ground beneath them. She said the only words that were spoken on their return to the Geofront.
零透过飞机的窗户凝视着，对着下方血迹斑斑的大地皱起了眉头。这是他们返回 Geofront 途中唯一被说出的话。

"If they tell us to clean that up, I shall refuse."
如果他们让我们去清理那个，我会拒绝。

### Chapter 26 NERV, Party Of Eight
Shinji growled softly as the pen fell from his bandaged fingers; it clattered to the floor and rolled away until it encountered a high heeled shoe. He reached down to try and pick it up, but the owner of the shoe raised a halting hand.
真嗣低声咆哮着，绷带缠绕的手指间笔滑落，咔哒一声落在地上，滚向一边，直到碰到一只高跟鞋。他弯腰试图捡起，但鞋的主人抬起手示意他停下。

"Don't worry too much about it, Shinji," Doctor Akagi said as she reached down to pick up the pen, placing it on the examination bed between her two patients.
"别太在意，真嗣，" 赤木博士说着，弯腰拾起笔，放在两位病人之间的检查床上。

Asuka huffed in frustration, staring at her own uncooperative hands. Like Shinji, the fight against Sahaquiel, as the Tenth Angel had been designated, had left its mark on her as well: large circles of darkened skin in the centre of their palms and on the backs of their hands. The feedback from Unit-01's injuries had thankfully stopped short of fully bleeding through to its pilots, but only just. Considering that their sync ratios had apparently been pushing against the safety systems to the point that their plug depth had to be constantly reduced, things could have been a lot worse.
明日香懊恼地哼了一声，盯着自己不听使唤的双手。和真嗣一样，与被命名为第十使徒萨哈魁尔的战斗也在她身上留下了痕迹：手掌中心和手背上都有大块的暗色皮肤。幸运的是，零号机受伤的反馈并未完全穿透到驾驶员身上，但也仅此而已。考虑到他们的同步率似乎一直在挑战安全系统，以至于插入栓深度不得不持续降低，情况本可能更糟。

Shinji didn't want to think about what would have happened if they'd actually ended up with holes in their hands.
真嗣不愿去想，如果他们的手真的出现了洞，会发生什么。

"The two of you should regain full motion in your hands in a day or two," Doctor Akagi continued, tapping away on her tablet. "But until then I'll inform your school that you're both staying home for medical reasons."
你们俩的手应该在一两天内就能完全恢复活动能力，"赤木医生继续说着，手指在平板电脑上敲击。"但在此之前，我会通知你们的学校，你们因医疗原因需要在家休息。

During the debriefing afterwards, the co-pilots of Unit-01 were stunned into silence when they saw a recording of what they had managed to accomplish just before catching the Angel. Shinji recalled reaching the hill in the blink of an eye, and now he knew why. Seconds after Asuka had harangued him to go faster, Unit-01 had gone supersonic; the recording showed shockwaves expanding out from Unit-01's body as it sprinted in excess of three hundred and fifty metres a second. But when they were asked how exactly they had accomplished such a feat, neither Shinji nor Asuka could offer up an explanation.
事后简报中，零号机的两位副驾驶员在看到他们捕获使徒前所达成壮举的录像时，震惊得哑口无言。真嗣回忆起自己眨眼间就到达了山丘，现在他明白了原因。就在明日香催促他加速后不久，零号机突破了音障；录像显示，零号机以每秒超过三百五十米的速度疾驰时，其身体周围激起了冲击波。但当被问及他们究竟是如何完成这一壮举时，无论是真嗣还是明日香都无法给出解释。

Eventually they were dismissed. Shinji, forgetting his injury for a moment, made to open the door out of the room, only for his bandaged and barely-functional hands to be incapable of gaining purchase on the smooth round door handle. He sighed and directed an expectant look at the two adults. Misato was the first to notice, and she hurried over to let them out.
最终他们被解散了。真嗣一时忘记了伤势，试图用缠着绷带、功能受限的双手去开门，却发现自己根本抓不住那光滑的圆形门把手。他叹了口气，向两位成年人投去期待的目光。美里最先注意到，急忙走过来帮他们开门。

"Thanks, Misato," said Shinji as he stepped out into the corridor.
"谢谢，美里，" 碇真嗣说着，踏进了走廊。

"Damnit, the next few days are going to really suck if we can't even manage such a simple task," Asuka groused.
"该死，如果连这么简单的任务都搞不定，接下来的几天可真够呛，" 明日香抱怨道。

"I guess we'll have to postpone that victory dinner then," said Misato as she and Doctor Akagi followed them out.
"看来我们得推迟那顿庆功宴了，" 美里说着，与赤木博士一同跟了出去。

"Afraid so, Misato," Akagi replied with a shrug, before turning to close the door. "If they can't even grip a pen, they certainly won't be able to hold chopsticks. It's certainly going to make their next few mealtimes interesting."
恐怕是的，美里，" 赤木回答着，耸了耸肩，随后转身关上门。"如果他们连笔都握不住，更别提拿筷子了。接下来的几顿饭，他们可得好好琢磨琢磨了。

"Just give us something we can eat with a fork or spoon," said Asuka, raising a hand and pressing her index and middle fingers together. "I've at least got this much motion."
就给我们弄点能用叉子或勺子吃的吧，"明日香说着，举起一只手，将食指和中指并拢。"我至少还能做到这点。

A bit of testing showed Shinji that he could do the same thing with his hands. "I suppose it's either that or finger food," he mused. He glanced at Asuka, who seemed to sense his gaze and turned her head to look at him. "So... what are we going to do for meals for the next couple days?"
稍微试了试，真嗣发现自己也能做到同样的事。"看来只能这样，要么就是手抓食物了，"他沉思道。他瞥了一眼明日香，后者似乎感应到了他的目光，转过头来与他四目相对。"那么...接下来几天我们怎么解决吃饭问题呢？"

Misato's face lit up. She grinned and raised a hand.
美里脸上顿时一亮，她咧嘴一笑，举起了手。

Akagi scoffed and batted it right back down. "No, Misato. They're already injured, I don't want to see a pilot back in the medical wing because you poisoned them. Or are you forgetting what happened when I came to visit?"
赤木嗤之以鼻，立刻将她的手拍了下去。"不行，美里。他们已经受伤了，我可不想看到有驾驶员因为你的‘毒害’而回到医疗室。还是你忘了我上次来访时发生的事了？"

Misato's face fell. 美里脸色一沉。

XXX

In the end, Shinji and Asuka made do with take-out. Sitting on the lounge, cradling a carton of food in their arm with a towel on their lap and a fork that was only nominally under their control wasn't exactly easy, but it was the best they could manage.
最终，真嗣和明日香只能将就着吃外卖。坐在客厅里，怀里抱着一盒食物，腿上搭着毛巾，手里勉强握着叉子，这并不容易，但已是他们能做的最好了。

Breakfast the next morning was a repeat of dinner, since Shinji and Asuka had ordered plenty of take-out. After taking off their bandages to shower, the two of them discovered they could, with some effort, hold cutlery much better than they could the night before. The discoloured skin hadn't faded at all, however; something that made Asuka begin to worry.
第二天早上的早餐与晚餐如出一辙，因为真嗣和明日香之前订了大量外卖。拆掉绷带洗完澡后，两人发现经过一番努力，他们能比前一晚更好地使用餐具了。然而，皮肤上的变色丝毫未减，这让明日香开始担忧起来。

Doctor Akagi didn't make things any better on that front, speculating that the scarring could be permanent. Her blunt statement had almost sent Asuka into shock, lamenting about her beauty being ruined, but by the time she and Shinji got back to their apartment she was mostly back to normal, if angrier than usual.
赤木博士在那方面并没有带来任何安慰，她推测这些疤痕可能是永久性的。她直白的言论几乎让明日香陷入震惊，哀叹自己的美貌被毁，但当她和真嗣回到公寓时，她已基本恢复正常，只是比平时更加愤怒。

That anger faded into simple grouchiness by the afternoon, but the sudden appearance of Misato with good news took care of that.
那份怒气到下午已淡化为简单的烦躁，但美里带着好消息的突然出现解决了这个问题。

"Ritsuko reckons your hands have recovered enough for that celebration dinner," she said after sitting down in their lounge room. "Of course it remains up to you two, since you'd know best if you can manage a normal meal."
律子认为你的手已经恢复得差不多，可以庆祝一下了，"她在客厅坐下后说道，"当然，这还得看你们俩，毕竟你们最清楚自己是否能正常用餐。

Shinji raised a hand and tried to clench it into a fist; he still couldn't quite manage that without receiving jolts of pain for his efforts, but he was at least able to hold things somewhat normally now. "I think we'll be fine," he answered, and Asuka nodded her agreement.
真嗣举起一只手试图握成拳头；尽管这样做仍会因疼痛而感到刺痛，但他现在至少能比较正常地抓握东西了。"我想我们应该没问题，"他回答道，而明日香也点头表示同意。

Misato smiled. "Good to hear. Apparently, Maya's been getting on Ritsuko's case a lot recently about taking a break from work. Today Rits responded by stating she's going to drag Maya along to the restaurant as well."
美里微笑着说："听你这么说真好。显然，最近玛雅一直在催律子从工作中抽身休息。今天律子回应说，她要把玛雅也拉到餐厅一起去。"

"So where are we going and when?" asked Asuka.
"那我们到底要去哪儿，什么时候去？" 明日香问道。

"We'll actually be going to Tokyo-2," Misato replied. "Ritsuko wrangled us the use of a high-speed VTOL in the unlikely event there's another Angel attack. It'll be dropping us off at a small airfield nearby, and a staff car will be taking us to the restaurant. Just in case there is an attack, there's a park nearby it can wait for us. Worst comes to worst it'll just land in the street outside the restaurant."
实际上我们要去的是第二新东京市，" 美里回答道，"律子帮我们争取到了一架高速垂直起降飞机的使用权，以防万一再有使徒袭击。它会先把我们送到附近的一个小型机场，然后有专车送我们去餐厅。万一真的有袭击，餐厅附近有个公园可以让飞机待命。最坏的情况，它就停在餐厅外的街道上。

Asuka narrowed her eyes and folded her arms. "What the hell happened to 'not allowed to leave Tokyo-3 at all?" she asked, recalling the conversation -or rather argument- she had had with Misato over going to Okinawa.
明日香眯起眼睛，双臂交叉。"那'根本不允许离开第三新东京市'是怎么回事？" 她质问道，回想起之前与美里关于去冲绳的那场争论。

"Well for starters, there's a difference between going to the next town over and going all the way to Okinawa," Misato retorted. "And secondly, so far there has never been a back-to-back Angel attack. Even the MAGI are confident that another Angel won't appear for at least another ten days."
首先，去隔壁城市和去冲绳完全是两码事，" 美里反驳道，"其次，到目前为止，还从未有过连续的使徒袭击。就连 MAGI 系统也确信，至少在接下来的十天内不会再有使徒出现。

"Have the MAGI never heard of Murphy?" Asuka rolled her eyes and turned away from Misato with a scoff.
"难道 MAGI 从未听说过墨菲定律吗？" 明日香翻了个白眼，嗤笑着转过身去，不再理会美里。

"Who?" asked Shinji. "谁？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka quirked an eyebrow. "You don't know Murphy's Law? Anything that can go wrong will go wrong?"
明日香挑了挑眉。"你不知道墨菲定律？凡是可能出错的事必定会出错？"

"Never heard of it," Shinji admitted. "But considering what piloting Eva has been like, I'll believe in that law."
从没听说过，" 真嗣承认道，"但考虑到驾驶 Eva 的经历，我愿意相信这条定律。

"Anyway," Misato butted in, calling the attention of the teenagers back to her. "We may be going a bit far away, but we're still taking precautions. Hence the VTOL."
不管怎样，" 葛城美里插话进来，把少年们的注意力重新引向自己。"我们虽然要去的地方有点远，但还是会采取预防措施。所以才用垂直起降飞机。

Asuka raised her hands. "Hey, I'm definitely not against a well-deserved free meal, I'm just making sure NERV isn't about to do something else stupid." She shot a pointed glance at Shinji.
明日香举起双手。"嘿，我绝对不反对一顿应得的免费大餐，我只是想确认 NERV 不会又做出什么蠢事。" 她向真嗣投去一个意味深长的眼神。

Misato groaned theatrically. "Yeah yeah, NERV screwed up in recruiting Shinji as late as they did. Can we please move past that?"
葛城美里夸张地叹了口气。"是是是，NERV 在这么晚才招募真嗣确实搞砸了。我们能不能别再提这事了？"

"Fine. So what restaurant are we going to in Tokyo-2?"
好吧。那我们去第二新东京市的哪家餐厅呢？

Even more theatrically, Misato folded her arms and snootily turned her head away with a sniff. "Well since you're being so mean, you'll just have to wait til we get there to find out!"
更加戏剧化地，美里双臂一抱，傲慢地扭过头去，还哼了一声。“既然你这么不客气，那就只好等到地方再揭晓答案了！”

"Oh no," groaned Shinji, bringing a hand up to palm his face. "It's another 'surprise'..."
“哦不，” 真嗣呻吟着，用手掌捂住脸。“又是‘惊喜’……”

XXX

After a quick stop next door to collect Rei, and another stop for Kensuke, the teenagers and Misato headed to a spot just outside the main Geofront entrance. There, they met up with Doctor Akagi and Lieutenant Ibuki... no, they were off-duty now so it was Ritsuko and Maya, who were standing near a parked aircraft. Kensuke, predictably, got incredibly enthusiastic about the 'YAGR-3T Rapid Transport VTOL Aircraft', and Asuka almost had to threaten physical violence to get the military nerd to settle down.
先顺道接了隔壁的绫波，又去接了剑介，这群青少年和美里一起前往主 Geofront 入口外的一处地点。在那里，他们与赤木博士和伊吹少尉会合——不，现在他们下班了，所以是律子和真由美，她们正站在一架停着的飞行器旁。不出所料，剑介对那架“YAGR-3T 快速运输垂直起降飞机”异常兴奋，而明日香差点就要动用武力威胁这个军事迷冷静下来。

With seven people, the aircraft's passenger bay was just barely large enough for the three adults and four teenagers. The flight wasn't exactly the height of comfort either; there was no sound insulation and the climate control was barely adequate at warding off the summer heat.
七个人挤进飞机的乘客舱，勉强够容纳三位成人和四位青少年。飞行体验也绝非舒适；没有隔音措施，空调系统对抗夏日酷热也仅是勉强够用。

Unfortunately, the journey involved passing over the site of yesterday's Angel attack again. The level of the... fluid in the valley hadn't subsided much, leaving a red stain wherever it had touched the earth, and the rice paddies Unit-01 had sprinted past were completely tainted.
不幸的是，这段旅程再次经过了昨日天使袭击的地点。山谷中的...液体并未消退多少，凡触及之处皆留下一片红色污渍，而零号机疾驰而过的稻田已彻底被污染。

"There's early indications that Sahaquiel's blood is contaminating the earth," Ritsuko grimly stated.
“初步迹象表明，萨拉奎尔的血液正在污染土地，”律子神情严肃地陈述道。

Rei, sitting next to the window, looked out at the once-pristine scenery with a look of disgust. "Even in death, the Angels seek to hurt us," she quietly said.
绫波坐在窗边，望着曾经纯净的景色，面露厌恶之色。“即便死去，天使仍企图伤害我们，”她轻声说道。

"There's not much we can do about this," Misato said with a scowl. "NERV doesn't have the funding or manpower to spare for humanitarian aid."
“对此我们无能为力，”美里皱眉说道，“NERV 既无资金也无人力可用于人道援助。”

The aircraft flew on in silence, soon putting the grisly spectacle behind them. Eventually, they heard the pilot call for and get landing clearance, and soon the group had solid ground under their feet once more. There were two black sedans waiting for them, one of the drivers simply standing and waiting for them while the other smoked a cigarette while leaning on the opposite side of his car.
飞机在静默中继续飞行，很快便将那恐怖的景象抛在了身后。最终，他们听到飞行员呼叫并获得了降落许可，不久，一行人再次踏上了坚实的地面。两辆黑色轿车在等待他们，其中一名司机静静地站着等候，而另一名则靠在自己车的另一侧，悠闲地抽着烟。

Misato headed directly for the smoker, practically stomping towards him. "And just what the hell are you doing here, Kaji?!" she growled.
葛城美里径直走向那位抽烟者，几乎是踩着重步朝他走去。“你到底在这里干什么，加持？！”她怒吼道。

"Kaji?" “加持？”

"Kaji?!" “加持？！”

Shinji and Asuka spoke at the same time, but their reactions were completely different. Once again, Asuka was practically bouncing on the spot at the mere mention of the scruffy man. And once again, there was a pang in Shinji's chest.
真嗣和明日香同时开口，但反应却截然不同。一提到那个邋遢的男人，明日香又一次兴奋得几乎要跳起来。而真嗣的心头，再次掠过一丝痛楚。

"Katsuragi." Kaji turned around, dropping his cigarette to the ground and snuffing it out with the heel of his shoe. "Why the hostility? Hello Ritsuko. And I see you brought your protégé along as well."
葛城。" 加持转过身，将烟头丢在地上，用鞋跟踩灭。"何必这么敌意呢？你好，律子。看来你还带着你的得意门生一起来了。

Ritsuko sighed. "Hello Kaji. And I'm going to warn you now. Stop flirting with Maya."
律子叹了口气。"你好，加持。我得警告你，别再对玛雅调情了。"

The young woman blushed nervously, looking as if she wanted to hide behind Doctor Akagi. Misato turned to direct an inquisitive look at the two of them, before folding her arms and almost glaring at Kaji.
年轻女子紧张得脸红，似乎想躲到赤木博士身后。美里转头用探询的目光打量着两人，随后双臂交叉，几乎是用瞪视的眼神看向加持。

Shinji blinked at the scene. Yet another sign that adulthood was strange.
真嗣对着这一幕眨了眨眼。这又是成年世界奇异性的又一例证。

Whatever problems the women had with Kaji, that didn't stop them from getting into his car. The teenagers were directed towards the other vehicle by its driver, who simply gave a polite bow and waved a hand towards it. Asuka and Kensuke both headed for the front passenger seat, only to almost bump into each other as they reached for the door. They stared at each other for a moment before Kensuke raised a fist. Asuka smirked and raised one as well, and the two of them played Janken for the seat.
无论那些女性对加持有什么不满，这并不妨碍她们上他的车。少年们被司机引导至另一辆车，司机只是礼貌地鞠了一躬，挥手示意他们过去。明日香和健介都朝着副驾驶座走去，却在伸手去拉车门时差点撞个正着。他们互相对视了一会儿，随后健介举起了拳头。明日香嘴角一挑，也举起了拳头，两人便玩起了剪刀石头布来决定座位。

Kensuke won. 健介赢了。

Asuka got into the back seat, grumbling German words that Shinji decided not to translate for Kensuke, and the car set off, following Kaji's vehicle as it left the airfield and entered the city.
明日香嘟囔着德语坐进了后座，真嗣决定不为健介翻译那些抱怨，车子随即启动，跟随加持的车辆离开了机场，驶入城市。

Tokyo-2 was much different to Tokyo-3. Not having been designed as a fortress, the city felt much more... alive. Even in the evening light, people were practically crowding the walkways to capacity as they went about their daily lives. Buildings were lit with brilliant neon signs advertising everything from shogi to sushi. The cars stopped at a traffic light, and the pedestrians flowed like water onto the crosswalks. Nearby, Shinji saw an imposing man in a white suit stare down another man at least a head or two taller and packing a lot more muscle than him. The crowds simply passed by them despite the fact that it clearly seemed a fight was about to kick off. The light turned green and the cars pulled away, the strange scene disappearing into the distance.
东京-2 与东京-3 大相径庭。未被设计成堡垒的这座城市，感觉上要鲜活得多。即便在傍晚的余晖中，人们几乎挤满了人行道，忙于各自的日常。建筑物上闪烁着耀眼的霓虹招牌，从将棋到寿司无所不包。车辆在红绿灯前停下，行人如流水般涌上斑马线。不远处，真嗣看到一个身穿白西装的威严男子，正瞪视着一个比他高出至少一头、肌肉也更为壮硕的另一人。尽管明显一场争斗即将爆发，人群却只是漠然地从他们身边经过。绿灯亮起，车辆启动，那奇怪的一幕随之消失在远方。

A few minutes later, as the cars pulled into a parking lot, Asuka's head shot around to look at something, and a second later she muttered, "No way..." Rei was also looking in the same direction, looking at least mildly surprised.
几分钟后，当车辆驶入停车场时，明日香的脑袋猛地转向某个方向，紧接着她低声嘟囔：“不可能吧……”零也朝同一方向望去，至少显得有些惊讶。

"What is it?" Shinji asked, twisting in his seat to try and get a glimpse of whatever it was that had caught her attention. It wasn't very difficult; in a sea of Japanese signs, the western lettering stood out like like an Evangelion at a police lineup. His eyebrows went up in surprise. "Tokio Brauhaus? We're going to a German restaurant?"
那是什么？" 真嗣问道，扭动身体试图看清楚是什么吸引了她的注意。这并不难；在一片日文招牌中，那西式的字母排列显得格外突出，就像使徒在警察的列队中一样显眼。他惊讶地扬起了眉毛。"东京啤酒屋？我们要去德国餐厅吗？

The cars parked next to each other, and Asuka was the first one out, her eyes shining. "Not a restaurant, dummy. Brauhaus. Beer hall!" Misato got out of the other car, and Asuka rounded on her. "It had better be where we're going and not some kind of prank!" she said, pointing a finger at their guardian in warning.
两辆车并排停下，明日香第一个跳了出来，眼中闪烁着光芒。"不是餐厅，笨蛋。是啤酒屋！" 美里也从另一辆车里出来，明日香立刻转向她。"我们最好真的是去那里，而不是什么恶作剧！" 她警告性地指着她们的监护人说道。

Misato waved her hands. "Of course not!" she replied, before pointing at the German sign. "That is exactly where we're going!"
美里摆了摆手。"当然不是！" 她回答道，然后指向那个德文招牌。"我们就是要去那里！"

"But... what's a beer hall doing in Japan?!"
但是... 日本的啤酒屋是做什么的？！

"There's quite a few of them throughout the country, actually," Ritsuko remarked. "This is just the closest one we found."
实际上，全国各地都有不少这样的地方，" 律子评论道，"这只是我们找到最近的一个。

Kaji stepped up behind the confused girl, turning her around and gently propelling her towards the place in question. "Don't worry about it. Instead of standing around out here, let's go sit down."
薰走到困惑的女孩身后，将她转过来，并轻轻推着她朝那个地方走去。"别担心，与其站在这里，不如我们进去坐下。"

The group headed inside, and some of them gasped in amazement at the interior. Several massive chandeliers took up most of the ceiling space, casting a warm light upon dozens of polished wooden tables; almost all of which were occupied. Staff bustled back and forth, weaving expertly between tables carrying full plates to patrons and ferrying empty ones away. One of them soon came up to the group and greeted them with a bow.
一行人走进去，有些人对内部装潢惊叹不已。几盏巨大的吊灯占据了大部分天花板空间，温暖的灯光洒在数十张抛光的木桌上，几乎每张桌子都坐满了人。服务员忙碌地穿梭于桌间，熟练地为顾客送上满载食物的盘子，又迅速撤走空盘。不久，一位服务员来到他们面前，鞠躬致意。

"NERV, party of eight," said Ritsuko.
"NERV，八人团，" 律子说道。

Apparently they had been very much expected, as the waitress did not bother to check the book for their reservation. "Of course," she said with an even deeper bow, before gesturing behind her. "Right this way please."
显然他们备受期待，因为服务员并没有费心去查看预订记录。“当然，”她鞠躬更深地说，随后伸手示意。“请这边走。”

They were seated at a semi-circular booth at the end of a row of them, the teenagers in the middle while the adults took the edges. Menus were already on the table, and Misato was the first to scoop one up. Predictably, she started checking out the various brews first, and her eyes widened. A second later, a predatory grin crossed her face.
他们被安排在了一排半圆形卡座尽头的一个位置，青少年们坐在中间，而成年人则占据了边缘。桌上已经摆好了菜单，美里是第一个拿起菜单的人。不出所料，她首先浏览起各种啤酒，眼睛顿时瞪大了。片刻后，她脸上掠过一丝狡黠的笑容。

"I know what I'm getting first!" she announced.
“我已经知道我要先点什么了！”她宣布道。

Ritsuko gave a good-natured scoff. "At least remember to save some space for food. You know what the drinks in a place like this will be like." She then looked at the teenagers. "You four will be allowed a drink as well, if-"
律子好脾气地嗤笑一声。“至少记得留点肚子给食物。你知道这种地方的饮品会是什么样的。”接着她转向青少年们。“你们四个也可以点一杯喝的，如果——”

She didn't get time to finish her sentence. Asuka leaned back in her seat with a loud gasp. "You really mean that?!" She sounded like she'd just been given a surprise birthday present. Shinji, meanwhile, was as stunned as if he'd stepped out in front of an Angel with no Evangelion. Kensuke seemed rather cheerful at the news, but Rei remained unperturbed.
她还没来得及说完话，明日香就猛地往后一靠，倒吸一口凉气。“你当真？！”她的声音像是突然收到了一份意外的生日礼物。而真嗣则震惊得如同赤手空拳面对使徒一般。听到这个消息，剑介显得颇为高兴，但零依旧面无表情。

Ritsuko levelled a frosty expression at Asuka until the girl calmed back down again. "If," she continued, "you agree to these non-negotiable stipulations. First, you'll only be getting one drink. Second, you'll only be having what we decide is suitable for you. Third, if at any point one of us-" she pointed at the other three adults and herself, "-decides you're starting to get drunk, you're cut off immediately. Understood?"
律子冷冷地盯着明日香，直到她重新平静下来。“如果，”她接着说，“你同意这些不可协商的条件。首先，你只能喝一杯。其次，你只能喝我们决定适合你的东西。第三，一旦我们中的任何一个——”她指了指其他三位成年人和自己，“——认为你开始醉了，就会立刻停止给你酒。明白了吗？”

Shinji, Kensuke and Asuka looked at each other for a few seconds, then nodded their agreement. Rei, on the other hand, spoke up. "I shall pass on the alcoholic drink."
真嗣、剑介和明日香相互对视了几秒，然后点头表示同意。而零则开口道：“我就不喝含酒精的饮料了。”

Leaning forward to look past Shinji and Kensuke, Asuka directed a surprised look at Rei. "Really, Wondergirl? Turning down free beer?"
明日香探身越过真嗣和剑介，惊讶地看向零。“真的吗，奇迹女孩？连免费的啤酒都不要？”

Rei stared back at her. "The offer is appreciated, but I simply do not feel like drinking alcohol."
绫波回望着她，说道：“你的提议我心领了，但我实在不想喝酒。”

Asuka blinked at her, then looked away and shrugged. "Eh, up to you. Personally I hate that the legal age over here is eighteen. In Germany it's fourteen."
明日香眨了眨眼，随即转过头去，耸了耸肩：“随你便。我个人就是讨厌这里法定饮酒年龄是十八岁。在德国，十四岁就可以了。”

Misato smirked. "It's only fourteen if accompanied by a guardian. Which, I might add, you are still not."
美里嘴角勾起一抹坏笑：“那得在监护人陪同下才行。顺便说一句，你现在还不是呢。”

"I'm only a couple months off!" Asuka hotly protested.
“我也就差那么几个月而已！”明日香不服气地反驳道。

Shinji wracked his brain. He and Asuka had compared birthdays in one of their early letters. 'Let's see if I can remember,' he thought to himself. 'It was... five? No, almost exactly six months after mine. Couple days either way. December...'
真嗣绞尽脑汁回忆着。他和明日香在早期的通信中曾比较过生日。'让我想想能不能记起来，' 他暗自思忖，'那是...五个月后？不，几乎正好六个月。前后差不了几天。十二月...'

He decided to take a guess. "Fourth of December, right?" Asuka gave him a wide smile and a nod, and Shinji inwardly cheered even as he felt an odd sensation in his chest.
他决定猜一猜。"是十二月四号，对吧？" 明日香给了他一个灿烂的微笑并点头，真嗣内心欢呼，同时感到胸口涌起一种奇异的感觉。

"So why are you letting us drink here and now?" Kensuke asked. "Is this some hidden NERV perk?"
那为什么现在允许我们在这里喝酒呢？" 健介问道，"这是不是 NERV 的某种隐性福利？

Ritsuko sighed and shook her head, crossing her arms in front of her on the table. "No, but considering we're constantly sending you out into possible death, you at least deserve some pleasures in your downtime. After all, depending on how this damn war goes, you might not even make it to eighteen."
律子叹了口气，摇摇头，双臂交叉放在桌上。"不是的，但考虑到我们不断派你们去面对可能的死亡，你们至少应该在休息时间享受些乐趣。毕竟，这场该死的战争走向如何，你们可能连十八岁都活不到。"

"Enough of all this unimportant chit-chat!" Misato announced. "Let's get down to what really matters!"
别再扯这些无关紧要的闲聊了！" 葛城美里宣布道，"咱们来谈谈真正重要的事吧！

"What's that?" Maya said; the first words Shinji noticed from the lieutenant all evening.
"什么事？" 真由说；这是真嗣整个晚上第一次注意到副官开口。

Misato threw her arms out wide, almost hitting Kaji in the face. "It's time to order, of course!"
葛城美里张开双臂，差点打到加持的脸。"当然是点菜的时候了！"

XXX

Forty-five minutes later, Shinji set his cutlery down and pushed his plate away, leaning back with a sigh. His injured hands had made things a little slower, but they were no longer as crippled as they were the day before.
四十五分钟后，真嗣放下刀叉，推开餐盘，向后一靠，叹了口气。他受伤的双手让事情进展得慢了些，但已不像前一天那样行动不便了。

To try and compensate for his lack of taste, Asuka had ordered the same as him, honey pork ribs, so that she could at least attempt to describe the flavours of their meals. He was certainly appreciative of the effort, even as he privately lamented the fact that he couldn't taste the food himself. Asuka seemed to sense this, as she promised to one day make a similar meal for him. This drew chuckles from Misato and Kaji, both enjoying some kind of beef dish, who got a scowl in response from Asuka.
为了弥补他味觉的缺失，明日香特意点了和他一样的蜜汁排骨，以便至少能尝试描述他们餐食的味道。他当然感激这份用心，尽管内心暗自叹息自己无法品尝食物。明日香似乎察觉到了这一点，承诺将来会为他做一道类似的菜肴。这让吃着某种牛肉料理的美里和加持都笑了起来，而明日香则回以一记白眼。

Misato's first drink of choice had raised several eyebrows: black beer, in a glass so huge it could be used as a bucket. And yet, somehow, she had been the first of the table to finish her drink. Whereupon she immediately ordered more beer.
美里首选的饮品让人不禁挑眉：一大杯黑啤，那杯子大得简直可以当水桶用。然而，不知怎么的，她竟是桌上第一个喝完自己饮品的人。紧接着，她立刻又点了更多的啤酒。

And more. 还要更多。

And more. 还要更多。

Shinji's beer had gone down like water which, considering his lack of taste, it may as well have been. He was constantly aware of four pairs of eyes on him as he drank at a speed that seemed to concern them, if Kaji's narrowed eyes were anything to go by, but as far as he could tell it wasn't having any effect on him. Of course, since this was the first time he'd consumed alcohol, there was nothing for him to compare it against.
真嗣喝下的啤酒如同清水一般，考虑到他那迟钝的味觉，或许真的与水无异。他始终感觉到四双眼睛紧盯着自己，随着他饮酒的速度似乎引起了他们的担忧，至少从加持那眯起的眼睛可以看出，但就他个人而言，酒精似乎并未产生任何影响。当然，由于这是他第一次饮酒，他无从比较。

Dessert was ordered, and as they waited Shinji heard Maya and Ritsuko talking quietly to each other. The younger woman seemed to have gradually shifted closer and closer to Ritsuko throughout the evening. Whatever they were discussing was evidently NERV-related, as he caught the words 'Pribnow Box'.
甜点已经下单，等待之际，真嗣听到摩耶和律子在低声交谈。整个晚上，这位年轻女士似乎逐渐向律子靠拢。从她们谈话中听到的“普里布诺框”一词判断，显然是在讨论与 NERV 相关的事宜。

"Huh?" Asuka's head jerked around. Clearly she had heard them too. "Something happening with the Pribnow Box?"
嗯？"明日香猛地转过头来，显然她也听到了。"普里布诺框那边出什么事了吗？

"Oi," Misato warned, shaking a finger at the other two women. "We're off the clock. Yer not s'posed to be talking about work here!"
喂，"美里警告道，对着另外两位女士摇了摇手指。"我们下班了，这里可不是谈工作的地方！

Ritsuko huffed in amusement. "Well now I think we'll have to, otherwise Asuka there is gonna get even more nosy."
律子忍不住轻笑一声，“看来我们非得这么做不可了，不然那边的明日香会变得更加好奇。”

"Hey, I'm just curious!" Asuka retorted. "That is where we did the dual sync tests that let Shinji pilot with me!"
“嘿，我只是好奇而已！”明日香反驳道，“那里就是我们进行双重同步测试的地方，让真嗣能和我一起驾驶！”

"It's nothing major, really," said Ritsuko, giving Misato an 'I told you so' look that caused the woman to groan. "There's four pilots now, and there's some new tests we have planned for all of you, so we've been overhauling the Pribnow Box rather than building an entirely new test chamber."
“其实没什么大不了的，”律子说着，向美里投去一个“我早告诉过你”的眼神，让后者不禁叹了口气。“现在有四位驾驶员了，我们计划对你们所有人进行一些新的测试，所以我们在翻新普里布诺盒，而不是建造一个全新的测试室。”

"What kind of tests?" asked Rei.
“什么样的测试？”绫波问道。

"Well, I guess technically it'll more be tests for us," said Ritsuko, pointing to herself and Maya. "We'll be sticking you in simulation bodies and monitoring every scrap of data the MAGI can take in. We're hoping to be able to find ways of improving your synchronisation with the Evas, and at the same time help us develop a new autopilot system."
嗯，严格来说，这更多是对我们的测试，" 理津子指着自己和玛雅说道。"我们会将你们放入模拟身体中，并让 MAGI 尽可能地监控每一丝数据。我们希望能找到提升你们与 Eva 同步率的方法，同时帮助我们开发一套新的自动驾驶系统。

"A new what." 新的什么？

The tone of Asuka's voice caused Shinji to glance at her. Her hands, resting on the table, were trying to clench into fists despite their injuries.
明日香的声音让真嗣不由得看了她一眼。她放在桌上的双手，尽管带着伤，却试图攥成拳头。

Ritsuko immediately sought to defuse her. "Not as a replacement for you," she sighed, waving a hand in dismissal. "As an emergency backup. Right now if something catastrophic were to happen in combat that knocks you out, your Evas would essentially shut down. Not exactly an ideal situation."
理津子立刻试图缓和气氛。"并不是要取代你们，" 她叹了口气，摆手表示否定。"作为紧急备用方案。目前如果在战斗中发生什么灾难性事件导致你们失去意识，你们的 Eva 基本上就会停止运作。这显然不是理想的情况。"

Asuka continued staring flatly at the scientist, before finally looking away with a haughty sniff. "Damn right you're not replacing us. No computer could do what we can; even your vaunted MAGI."
明日香继续面无表情地盯着那位科学家，最终傲慢地哼了一声，转过头去。“你当然不能取代我们。没有电脑能做到我们能做的事；即使是你们引以为傲的 MAGI 也不行。”

The look Ritsuko gave Asuka was as chilly as the ice in their glasses.
律子看向明日香的眼神，冷得就像他们杯中的冰块。

"Um... she is right, in a way," Maya quietly stated, flinching slightly upon receiving the attention of everybody else at the table, but she recovered quickly. "Sure, the MAGI are the most powerful supercomputers in the world, but even they have limits. If we sent out an Eva controlled solely by autopilot, it's entirely likely that they would lose due to not being able to rapidly adapt to changing circumstances like a human can."
“嗯……从某种程度上说，她是对的，”玛雅轻声说道，当感受到桌上所有人的目光时，她微微一缩，但很快恢复了镇定。“确实，MAGI 是世界上最强大的超级计算机，但它们也有局限。如果我们派出仅由自动驾驶控制的 Eva，它们很可能会因为无法像人类那样迅速适应变化的环境而失败。”

"Besides," Kensuke remarked. "A program can't project an AT-Field, can it? You still need us in the hot seat for that."
“再说了，”剑介插话道，“程序又不能投射 AT 力场，对吧？要做到这一点，你们还是需要我们坐在驾驶舱里。”

"Exactly," Asuka replied. "Jet Alone would have been screwed the first time it fought an Angel for both reasons."
确实如此，" 明日香回答道。"无论是哪种情况，杰特·阿赖恩第一次对抗使徒时就已经注定要失败了。

"So like I said," Ritsuko interjected. "It'll be an emergency backup, nothing more. You have no need to worry about being sidelined."
就像我说的，" 律子插话道，"它只会作为紧急备用，不会再有更多用途。你不必担心会被边缘化。

Shinji didn't know whether or not to feel relieved about that statement. Thankfully their dessert arrived and the topic shifted back away from NERV.
真嗣不确定是否应该对这句话感到宽慰。幸好他们的甜点上来了，话题也随之转回了与 NERV 无关的事情上。

XXX

"Uurrrgghhhh..." 呃呃呃……

"I knew this would happen," sighed Asuka as Misato vomited on the grass near the VTOL parked on the tarmac.
"我就知道会这样，"明日香叹了口气，看着美里在停机坪上停放的垂直起降飞机旁的草地上呕吐。

Shinji's full stomach wasn't reacting very well to the return flight to Tokyo-3 either. And though he knew she was trying her best to hide it, he could tell that Asuka was feeling at least a little queasy. It was clear now that NERV's rapid transport aircraft weren't exactly designed with comfort as a primary concern.
真嗣饱胀的肚子对返回第三新东京市的飞行也反应不佳。尽管他知道她正尽力掩饰，但他能看出明日香至少也感到有些恶心。显然，NERV 的快速运输飞机并没有将舒适作为首要考虑。

Ritsuko gave a despairing groan as she moved over to Misato, rubbing the drunk woman's back. Kaji had left them at the airfield in Tokyo-2, stating that his work was keeping him there for a few more days. Now there were three adults left, and two of them were clearly in no fit state to drive. Maya seemed dead on her feet, practically leaning on Ritsuko even while the scientist was tending to her friend.
律子绝望地呻吟一声，走过去给醉酒的美里揉背。加持已经离开了他们在第二新东京市的机场，声称他的工作还需要在那里多待几天。现在只剩下三个成年人，其中两个显然不适合开车。玛雅看起来筋疲力尽，几乎靠在正在照顾朋友的律子身上。

"So, what are we gonna do about getting home?" asked Kensuke. "Misato drove us here but-" He was interrupted by a groan from the woman in question.
"那我们怎么回家呢？" 健介问道。"是美里开车带我们来的，但是——" 他的话被美里的一声呻吟打断了。

"I guess I'll have to call Section Two and get a second driver out here for you," Ritsuko mused, glancing over at the black NERV sedan parked next to Misato's car.
"看来我得联系第二部门，再派个司机来接你了。" 律子若有所思地说道，目光扫过停在美里车旁的那辆黑色 NERV 轿车。

Asuka shot Shinji a meaningful look. He blinked, and then remembered what happened last time Misato couldn't drive. "Really? You want to take us home after you've been drinking? What about your hands, too?"
明日香意味深长地瞥了真嗣一眼。他眨了眨眼，随即想起上次美里不能开车时的情景。"真的吗？你想在我们喝了酒之后带我们回家？那你的手怎么办？"

"Oh please!" replied Asuka, folding her arms in front of her. "For starters, my hands are perfectly capable of holding a steering wheel. And second, that's not the first time I've had alcohol. I know my own tolerances, and that single weak beer wasn't even close. It's either that, wait for Section Two, or have Akagi try and get us all home."
拜托！" 明日香回答道，双臂交叉在胸前。"首先，我的手完全能够握住方向盘。其次，这也不是我第一次喝酒。我很清楚自己的酒量，那一小杯淡啤酒根本不算什么。要么这样，要么等第二部门派人来，或者让赤木试着把我们都送回家。

"Considering I don't even have a license, that's not going to happen," said Ritsuko. She stood up straight, running a hand through her hair and exhaling in exasperation as she looked at Misato's car and back to Asuka.
"考虑到我连驾照都没有，那是不可能的。" 律子站直身子，一手捋过头发，无奈地叹了口气，目光从美里的车转向明日香。

"Well... I can at least say she definitely knows how to drive safely," Shinji offered. "She was the one who took Misato and I home from the airport on her first day here."
嗯...至少可以说她确实知道如何安全驾驶," 真嗣说道。"她是第一天来这里时，开车把我和美里从机场接回家的。

"I do not believe Asuka is impaired by alcohol," said Rei. "I will place my trust in my fellow pilot."
我不认为明日香受到了酒精的影响," 绫波说道。"我会信任我的同僚驾驶员。

"Me too," Kensuke added. "If I can trust her to watch my back in a fight, I can trust her to get us home."
我也是," 健介补充道。"如果我能相信她在战斗中能保护我的后方，我就能相信她能带我们回家。

Ritsuko waved a hand at them. "Oh, fine," she grumbled, before fishing Misato's keys out of the woman's pocket and tossing them to Asuka. "NERV will still be keeping an eye on you, however, so don't get any ideas about joyriding. All of our pilots in one vehicle makes me nervous as it is. Although..." She glanced at Misato. "Considering how she drives when carrying you kids around while sober... Whatever. I'll get her into the car, but you're on your own if she... makes a mess."
律子向他们挥了挥手。"哦，好吧," 她嘟囔着，然后从美里的口袋里掏出钥匙扔给明日香。"不过，NERV 还是会监视你的，所以别想着兜风。所有驾驶员在一辆车里已经让我够紧张的了。虽然..." 她瞥了一眼美里。"考虑到她清醒时载着你们这些孩子开车的样子...算了。我会把她弄进车里，但如果她...弄脏了，你们就自己处理吧。"

Shinji made a face at the thought. He, Rei and Kensuke clambered into the back seat of Misato's car, and Kensuke put the front passenger seat back into position so that Ritsuko could steer Misato, who seemed about to fall asleep, into the car.
想到这里，真嗣做了个鬼脸。他和零、健介爬进了美里车子的后座，健介将副驾驶的座位调回原位，以便让丽子能引导似乎快要睡着的美里坐进车里。

"All set?" asked Ritsuko once Misato was buckled in. Asuka nodded, and got a return nod from the woman. "Good. I'll see you all at the next sync test in a couple of days."
都准备好了吗？"丽子在美里系好安全带后问道。明日香点了点头，丽子也回以一个点头。"好的。过几天同步测试时再见。

With that farewell, Ritsuko backed away from the car. Maya stumbled over and latched onto her arm. The owner of said arm shot a frown at her, but Maya either didn't notice or didn't care as she gave the departing car a shaky farewell wave.
说完告别的话，丽子退后几步离开车子。玛雅踉跄着走过来，紧紧抓住她的手臂。手臂的主人皱了皱眉，但玛雅似乎没注意到，或者根本不在乎，她向远去的车子挥了挥颤抖的手。

"...Huh," said Asuka once they were on the road. "I can't say I was expecting... that."
...哈，"当他们上路后，明日香开口道，"我真没想到会是...这样。

"What do you mean?" asked Shinji, looking fruitlessly over his shoulder into the night behind them.
"你什么意思？" 真嗣问道，徒劳地回头望向他们身后的夜色。

"I am not surprised," said Rei. "In all the time I have known them, they seem to be most relaxed around each other."
我不感到惊讶，" 绫波说，"在我认识他们的所有时间里，他们似乎在彼此身边最为放松。

"Oh, you mean the Doctor and the Lieutenant?" asked Kensuke. "I thought something might develop the first time I saw the two of them in the same room. It was the way Ibuki looked at Akagi when she wasn't looking that clued me in."
哦，你是指博士和少尉吗？" 健介问道，"我第一次看到他们俩在同一个房间时就觉得可能会有什么发展。是伊吹看赤木时的那种眼神，当她没注意时，我就明白了。

Rei nodded. "I have seen that same expression on some of our female classmates. However, I do not believe that Doctor Akagi has actually reciprocated Maya's romantic feelings yet. She seems... hesitant."
绫波点头道："我在我们一些女同学脸上也见过那种表情。不过，我不认为赤木博士已经回应了真由美的浪漫情感。她似乎……有些犹豫。"

"Hold up a second," said Asuka as she glanced at the back seat through the rear view mirror. "Who's crushing on who in our class?"
等一下，" 飞鸟透过后视镜瞥了一眼后座说道，"我们班上谁暗恋谁啊？

"From my observations, there are at least five instances of unrequited romance in Class 2-A," said Rei, bringing a hand up to her chin. "Hanako Kamachi and Kiyoshi Kusumoto, Hikari Horaki and Toji Suzuhara, Mizuki Ozawa and Ryobe Fumihiko, and..." She paused, glancing at Shinji for a moment.
"据我观察，2-A 班至少有五对单相思，" 绫波说着，手托着下巴，"神乐坂花子和楠本清志，堀木光和铃原冬二，尾泽美月和文彦良平，还有……" 她停顿了一下，目光短暂地投向了真嗣。

"Wait, the class rep and Toji?!" Kensuke interjected.
"等等，班长和冬二？！" 健介插话道。

"Oh yeah," said Asuka, giving a small chuckle. "I can see that too. You spend a lot of time around Suzuhara, surely you must have noticed something."
哦，对啊，" 飞鸟轻笑一声，"我也能看出来。你经常和铃原在一起，肯定注意到了什么吧。

Kensuke shrugged. "I... guess? But I thought she was just keeping a close eye on him for, you know, the trouble he tends to get into."
健介耸了耸肩。“我...猜吧？但我觉得她只是为了防止他惹麻烦，所以对他格外留心。”

Asuka shook her head and tsked. "For someone with an obsession with photography you don't seem all that observant. Anyway, who are the last two pairs, Rei?"
明日香摇摇头，啧了一声。“对一个痴迷摄影的人来说，你似乎不太善于观察。话说回来，最后两对是谁，绫波？”

Rei seemed somewhat hesitant, but with everybody's attention on her she eventually spoke. "...Juri Nakano and Naoko Takishida both look at... Shinji Ikari."
绫波显得有些犹豫，但在众人的注视下，她最终开口说道：“...中野朱里和高志田直子都在看...碇真嗣。”

"What?!" “什么？！”

The twin shouts of surprise caused Misato to jerk into wakefulness. "Gimmmmee a sitrep!" she slurred in a drunken approximation of the tone she usually took while on duty. She then proceeded to panic and grasp at something in front of her, presumably the steering wheel she thought she was sitting behind.
两声惊呼让美里猛地惊醒。“给...给我情况报告！”她醉醺醺地模仿着平时执勤时的语气含糊说道。随后她开始慌乱，伸手去抓眼前的东西，大概是以为自己正坐在驾驶座上抓方向盘。

"Oh settle down, Misato," Asuka ordered. Misato's hands froze in midair, and she turned her head to look at the girl. "I'm taking us home since you're drunk."
哦，冷静点，美里，"明日香命令道。美里的双手在半空中僵住了，她转过头来看着女孩。"既然你喝醉了，我带我们回家。

Misato blinked slowly, then relaxed in her seat a fraction. She shook her head to try and clear some of the fog from her brain. "Oh right," she mumbled. "Kaji taught you."
美里缓缓地眨了眨眼，然后在座位上稍微放松了一些。她摇了摇头，试图清除一些脑中的迷雾。"哦，对了，"她嘟囔着。"是加持教你的。"

"Yeah. I just gotta drop Kensuke off then we'll be going back to the apartment."
嗯。我得先把洞木送回去，然后我们就回公寓。

"Speaking of which," said Kensuke. "How do you even know where to go?"
说到这个，"洞木说。"你怎么知道该往哪儿走？

"Asuka seems to have a photographic memory of the Tokyo-3 area," said Shinji, still reeling somewhat from Rei's revelation. He caught Asuka's eye in the mirror. "I assume that also means she knows where you live."
明日香似乎对第三新东京市的区域有着过目不忘的记忆，" 真嗣说道，仍因绫波的揭露而有些震惊。他从后视镜中捕捉到明日香的目光。"我想这也意味着她知道你住哪儿。

"Well... actually I don't," Asuka corrected, tapping a finger on the steering wheel. "I'm still waiting on an address."
嗯... 其实我不知道，" 明日香纠正道，手指轻敲着方向盘。"我还在等一个地址。

"Oh. Right." 哦。对。

Kensuke gave his address, and Asuka thought for a moment. "Only a few minutes away now, then."
健介报出了自己的地址，明日香思索片刻后说："那现在就剩几分钟的路程了。"

In fact, it was four minutes before the Alpine pulled up in front of Kensuke's house. Rather than try to dislodge a dozing-off Misato to let him out, Asuka, Shinji and Rei got out the other side to let Kensuke exit the vehicle. He waved farewell at them as they piled back into the car, and soon the Alpine was off and running again.
实际上，阿尔卑斯车在健介家门前停稳时，已经过去了四分钟。与其费力唤醒昏昏欲睡的明日香让他下车，不如让真嗣、明日香和零从另一侧下车，以便健介离开车辆。他们重新挤进车里时，健介向他们挥手告别，很快阿尔卑斯车又启动了。

"So." Shinji glanced at the rear view mirror. Asuka's eyes seemed to pierce into his. "Rei, you're sure about Nakano and Takishida?"
那么。" 真嗣瞥了一眼后视镜。明日香的目光仿佛穿透了他的灵魂。"零，你确定是中野和高岛吗？

"Yes. I've often seen them both looking at Shinji when he passes by them."
是的。我经常看到他们俩在真嗣经过时盯着他看。

"R-really?" Shinji stammered. "Um... but why, though?"
真、真的吗？" 真嗣结巴着问。"嗯... 但这是为什么呢？

The sudden silence in the car was almost deafening. Even Misato seemed awake enough to be following the conversation, and she turned in her seat to give him a stare so flat it could be used to build a wall. In the rear view mirror, he could see one of Asuka's eyebrows very slowly ascend.
车内突如其来的寂静几乎震耳欲聋。连似乎清醒了不少的葛城美里也像是跟上了对话，她转过身来，用一种平得可以用来砌墙的眼神盯着他。从后视镜中，他看到明日香的一边眉毛缓缓挑起。

"I-I mean, I understand they're... um... i-interested in me," he eventually managed to say. "But, um... why are they interested?"
我-我是说，我明白她们...呃...对-对我感兴趣，"他终于勉强说道，"但是，呃...她们为什么感兴趣呢？

Misato snorted, turning away with a grin. "Gee, I don't know," she said, with slightly less of a slur to her words now. "Maybe it's 'cause yer an Eva pilot?"
葛城美里嗤笑一声，转过身去，脸上挂着笑意。"哎呀，我怎么知道，"她说话时口齿略显清晰了些，"可能是因为你是 Eva 驾驶员吧？"

Shinji blinked, and then grimaced. "Because I'm a pilot?" Was that it? Did two girls in his class really like him for so shallow a reason? He glared out the car window, almost resting his chin on his hand before remembering the current state of it. "Of course it's that..." he spat venomously.
真嗣眨了眨眼，随后皱起眉头。"因为我是驾驶员？"就因为这个吗？班上那两个女孩真的会因为这么肤浅的理由喜欢他吗？他怒视着车窗，几乎要把下巴搁在手上，却又记起了手上的伤。"当然是因为这个..."他愤愤地吐出这句话。

His reaction seemed to bring the mood in the car down. He could still feel eyes on him, but he remained staring out at the night. Nothing more was said until they reached the apartment building.
他的反应似乎让车内的气氛变得沉重。他仍能感觉到众人的目光，但他只是凝视着夜色，一言不发。直到抵达公寓楼，才打破了沉默。

Everybody exited the car, Misato much more unsteadily than the others, and Shinji and Asuka helped guide their guardian to her apartment without incident. Rei took over from there, promising to see Misato to bed and bidding her friends goodnight.
众人陆续下车，美里比其他人更加摇摇晃晃。真嗣和明日香搀扶着他们的监护人，顺利地将她送回公寓。随后，绫波接手，承诺会照顾美里入睡，并向朋友们道了晚安。

In their own apartment, Shinji and Asuka removed their shoes near the front door and headed for the lounge room. Asuka turned the television on and began channel surfing, while Shinji slouched in his seat staring at nothing.
回到自己的公寓，真嗣和明日香在门口脱下鞋子，走向客厅。明日香打开电视，开始随意切换频道，而真嗣则瘫坐在椅子上，目光空洞。

"-is guaranteed to be at least no worse than what you're using now-"
-保证至少不会比你现在用的差-

"-if you think I'm signing that time card, forget it!-"
-你要是以为我会签那个考勤卡，那就别想了！-

"-our special blend of catnip and steel-belted radial tyres holds up to the most determined feline destructive tendencies-"
-我们特制的猫薄荷与钢丝子午线轮胎混合物，能经受住最顽固的猫咪破坏倾向-

"Ugh, the usual trash," Asuka remarked after several minutes. "So... Shinji?" He looked over to see her idly tapping the remote control on her leg. "Do you... hate being an Eva pilot?"
唉，还是那些垃圾节目，" 过了几分钟，明日香评论道。"那么... 真嗣？" 他转头看去，只见她正无聊地用遥控器轻敲着自己的腿。"你... 讨厌当 Eva 驾驶员吗？

It took him a little while to reply, as he didn't have a straight answer. Practically the whole reason he was a pilot now was because he had almost begged to be allowed to do something besides sitting around. But at the same time...
他花了一点时间才回答，因为他并没有一个直接的答案。他现在几乎是因为不想无所事事而几乎恳求成为驾驶员的。但与此同时...

"I don't... hate it," he finally said with a sigh. "But it's not something I'd want to do forever. We're risking our lives out there, and we've nearly died on several occasions. When this war is over I'll be happy if I never see the inside of an entry plug again."
我并不...讨厌它，"他终于叹了口气说道，"但那不是我想永远做的事。我们在外面冒着生命危险，有好几次差点丧命。如果这场战争结束，我会很高兴如果我再也不必进入插入栓内部。

Asuka stiffened, ceasing the tapping of the remote control. "Fine. You don't enjoy it like I do, I get that. Is that why were you so angry when you learned about two girls in our class liking you?"
明日香身体一僵，停止了遥控器的敲击。"好吧。你并不像我这样享受它，我明白。这就是为什么当你得知我们班上有两个女孩喜欢你时，你会那么生气吗？"

"They don't like me," replied Shinji, slapping a hand against his chest for emphasis and ignoring the jolt of pain. "They like the pilot. The celebrity. I'd just be a... a trophy to them. Like dating a music star or something." He sighed in frustration. "What kind of relationship would that be? Just them showing off that they're dating an Eva pilot."
她们喜欢的不是我，"真嗣回答道，用手拍打着胸膛以示强调，同时忽略了随之而来的疼痛。"她们喜欢的是驾驶员。是名人。我只会是...她们的战利品。就像和音乐明星约会一样。"他沮丧地叹了口气。"那样的关系算什么？只是她们炫耀自己正在和一个 Eva 驾驶员约会。

"How do you even know that that's why they're interested? Misato just said it as a possibility."
你怎么知道她们感兴趣的原因就是这个？美里只是说有可能而已。

Shinji gave her a long stare. "Do you think they'd even look at me at all if I weren't a pilot?"
真嗣对她凝视良久，问道：“如果我不是驾驶员，你觉得他们还会多看我一眼吗？”

Asuka returned the stare with a sceptical one of her own. "They might. You don't know that for sure."
明日香以怀疑的目光回敬他，说：“也许会吧。你也不能肯定。”

With a derisive scoff, Shinji got up and headed towards the kitchen. He was starting to get thirsty.
真嗣嗤笑一声，站起身朝厨房走去。他开始感到口渴了。

"Well then... what kind of person would you prefer to have an interest in you?" Asuka asked from behind him.
“那么……你希望什么样的人对你感兴趣呢？”明日香在他身后问道。

Shinji halted at the doorway. He glanced over his shoulder at her. She had sounded almost nervous, but he didn't know why. "I... um... I guess... somebody who likes me as a person, not just for what I do. Somebody who wouldn't just be with me because of my status. And somebody who..." He exhaled through pursed lips as he tried to think of the right words. "Who could... understand the kinds of things us pilots go through. Who knows that it's not all fun and games. Somebody like..." His face grew hot and he quickly looked away again. "Um... nevermind!"
真嗣在门口停下脚步，回头望向她。她的声音听起来几乎有些紧张，但他不明白为什么。“我……呃……我想……应该是那种喜欢我这个人本身，而不只是因为我所做的事情的人。那种不会仅仅因为我的地位而和我在一起的人。还有……”他抿着嘴唇，试图找到合适的词，“那种能……理解我们这些驾驶员所经历的事情的人。知道这并非全是乐趣和游戏。就像……”他的脸颊发烫，迅速再次移开视线，“呃……算了！”

He practically ran out into the kitchen, grabbing a glass and filling it at the tap. He drained the glass somewhat faster than he intended, just barely managing to not choke, and headed past the doorway to the lounge room as he made his way to his room. He caught a brief glimpse of Asuka on the way.
他几乎是跑进了厨房，抓起一个杯子，在水龙头下接满水。他喝水的速度比预想的要快，差点呛到，然后穿过门厅走向客厅，再往自己的房间走去。途中，他瞥见了明日香。

Had it just been his imagination, or did she look somewhat redder than usual?
难道只是他的错觉，还是她的脸颊比平时更红了些？

### Chapter 27 Ireul

It was a beautiful day outside. The semi-permanent blazing summer heat had retreated for the time being, throwing a look over its shoulder that promised a return. The people of Tokyo-3 were temporarily allowed outside without having to slather on sunscreen or worry about heatstroke. It was also a Sunday, and therefore a day off from school.
外面天气晴朗宜人。持续已久的酷暑暂时消退，临走时还回头一瞥，似乎在预告它的再次降临。东京-3 的居民得以暂时摆脱防晒霜和热射病的困扰，自由地外出。恰逢周日，学校也放假了。

This all meant that today was the perfect time for NERV to pull all its pilots a kilometre underground for the mysterious tests Doctor Akagi had talked about.
这一切都表明，今天正是 NERV 将所有驾驶员召集至地下一公里，进行赤木博士所提到的神秘测试的完美时刻。

Shinji, Asuka and Kensuke all stared forlornly at the entrance to the Geofront as the gate closed behind Misato's car. While Shinji himself didn't have any plans for the day, Asuka had been intending to spend the day with Hikari at the mall, and clearly Kensuke had had something planned as well. Instead, now they were all going to have to sit and do nothing in a metal tube full of orange sludge for hours on end while other people observed them.
真嗣、明日香和健介都无精打采地望着通往 Geofront 的入口，大门在美里的车后缓缓关闭。真嗣当天本无安排，而明日香原计划与光在商场共度时光，健介显然也有自己的打算。如今，他们却不得不在充满橙色泥浆的金属舱内枯坐数小时，任由他人观察。

As Asuka had ground out through gritted teeth: What. Fun.
就像明日香咬紧牙关挤出的话：“真有意思。”

Even the beauty of the outdoor area of the Geofront to the right of the vehicle elevator did little to improve the mood of the teenagers. It just seemed to be salt in the wound, since they weren't going to be anywhere near it soon. Like passing by a fairground on the way to the doctor.
车辆电梯右侧 Geofront 的户外美景，并未能提振青少年的情绪。这反倒像是伤口上撒盐，因为他们近期根本无法靠近那里。犹如在前往医院的途中路过一个游乐场，徒增无奈。

Shinji quietly gave a mirthless chuckle, drawing a glance from Kensuke. Considering who they were about to meet, that was an apt analogy.
碇真嗣默默地发出了一声干笑，引起了洞木光的注意。考虑到他们即将见的人，这个比喻确实很恰当。

XXX

"Hello," said the doctor in question ten minutes later, once the pilots finally arrived at the entrance to the Pribnow Box. "Ready for the most complicated sync test yet?"
你们好，"十分钟后，当飞行员们抵达普里布诺盒的入口时，医生问道，"准备好迎接迄今为止最复杂的同步测试了吗？

Asuka simply shot Doctor Akagi a scowl. Shinji frowned at that; normally she was the one who most looked forward to the tests. As their scores steadily increased, Asuka's went up just that little bit faster. Except when she was on her own, on the rare occasions Shinji was pulled away for a solo test 'just in case'. Then, Asuka's scores actually seemed to dip fractionally, letting the others catch up a little. Of course, as she repeatedly said, tests and combat were two different things.
明日香只是向赤木博士投去了一个怒视。真嗣见状皱起了眉头；通常她是最期待测试的那个人。随着他们的成绩稳步提高，明日香的成绩总是略微领先。但每当真嗣偶尔被单独拉去进行“以防万一”的测试时，明日香的成绩似乎就会略有下滑，让其他人有机会稍微追赶上来。当然，正如她一再强调的，测试和实战是两回事。

Doctor Akagi opened the door and stepped inside, and the pilots and Misato followed. They immediately halted, bunching up in the doorway and gasping at the changes.
阿卡吉医生推门而入，飞行员们和 Misato 随即跟进。一行人刚进门便驻足不前，挤在门口，对眼前的变化惊叹不已。

Before, the Pribnow Box had been a little room with a couple of control panels looking into a just-as-small test chamber. Now it was larger, with a lot more computers all over the place, and the test chamber...
过去，Pribnow Box 仅是一个配备了一两块控制面板的小房间，其对面是一个同样紧凑的测试室。如今，它已扩展，遍布着众多电脑，而那测试室...

Shinji stepped over to the window. His stomach flipped a little as he saw how far down the test chamber's floor was; it looked like it could hold an entire Evangelion now, but it didn't hold anything interesting just yet.
真嗣走到窗前，俯瞰测试舱的地面，感到一阵眩晕，那空间之大仿佛足以容纳一台完整的福音战士，然而眼下那里空无一物，尚未有任何引人注目之物。

"As you can see, the changes are quite drastic," said Doctor Akagi behind him. "We've got more specialised tests planned in the future."
正如您所见，变化非常剧烈，"阿贺木医生在他身后说道。"我们未来还计划进行更多专业化的测试。

"So what are we doing today?" asked Kensuke.
"我们今天有什么安排？" 肯助问道。

Doctor Akagi jerked her head to the doorway to the change rooms. "Well for the moment, you four will be going through that door."
医生阿卡吉突然将头转向通往更衣室的门。“现在，你们四个就从那扇门进去。”

"Right, plugsuit time, boys and girls!" Asuka announced, beckoning the other teenagers along as she headed through the door. Shinji followed, but heard a snort behind him and turned his head. All he saw was Misato looking into the test chamber and Doctor Akagi staring intently at one of the computers.
"好了，该穿战斗服了，各位！" 明日香大声宣布，挥手让其他年轻人跟上，自己则向门口走去。真嗣紧随其后，却听到背后传来一声嗤笑，他回头一看。只见美里正凝视着测试室，而赤木博士则全神贯注地盯着一台电脑。

It must have been his imagination.
这肯定是他的想象。

Heading into the corridor, Shinji reached the revamped change room. Or rather, rooms, as it was now four stalls, their walls coming up to about neck height, instead of a single room separated by a privacy screen. He hurried to duck into the first booth, which was still open. He closed the door, turned around and-
穿过走廊，真嗣来到了重新装修的更衣区。这里已不再是单一的房间，而是分成了四个隔间，隔板约至颈部高度。他快步进入第一个空着的隔间，关上门，转身面对——

"Wait, where's my plugsuit?"
等等，我的驾驶服去哪儿了？

"Wait, where's my plugsuit?!"
等等，我的驾驶服去哪儿了？

Once again, he and Asuka said the same thing at the same time. A moment later, Kensuke said something similar.
又一次，他和明日香异口同声地说出了同样的话。不久，健介也表达了类似的观点。

"...Okay who's the genius NERV lackey that forgot to supply our plugsuits?!" Asuka demanded. "How are we supposed to do the tests without them?"
...好吧，到底是哪个 NERV 的糊涂蛋忘了给我们配备插入栓服?!" 明日香质问道。"没有这些装备，我们怎么进行测试?

There was a crackle, and a voice came over a loudspeaker. "Doing the tests without them is exactly what you'll be doing," said Doctor Akagi. Shinji looked up, but couldn't see anywhere obvious her voice could be coming from.
突然传来一阵噼啪声，扬声器里响起一个声音：“你们即将进行的测试，就是没有他们在场的情况，”赤木博士如此说道。真嗣抬头四处寻找，却无法确定声音究竟从何而来。

"What, are we not getting changed after all?" asked Kensuke.
"怎么，我们最终还是不换衣服了吗？" 肯助问道。

"Oh no, you'll still be getting undressed. You're required to be naked for these tests-"
哎呀，你还得继续脱，这些测试要求你裸体进行——

"Ex-cuse me?!" Asuka shouted at the ceiling, her voice dripping with disgust. "You're making us prance around naked just for some tests?! Do you really expect me to bare all in front of your cameras, your goons and these boys?!"
你说什么？！"飞鸟对着天花板怒吼，语气中满是鄙夷。"就为了几个测试，你让我们裸着身子四处走动？！你真以为我会当着你的摄像头、你的打手和这些男孩的面，一丝不挂吗？！

The teenagers glanced at each other over the privacy screens, four pairs of cheeks turning bright red. Shinji was sure he could see steam rising from Asuka's head.
青少年们隔着隐私屏彼此对视，四张脸颊都涨得通红。真嗣敢肯定，明日香头顶仿佛都冒出了蒸汽。

"You are required to be naked for these tests because we'll be monitoring your bodies directly. Yes there will be cameras, but they'll be switched to thermal vision so we won't see anything, and there will be no NERV personnel on your way. I don't care how you decide to preserve your modesty, but you are not taking anything into the test chamber besides your own bodies. Not even A-10 clips. Just be glad we're not putting you and Shinji in the same plug today. Now figure something out. You have five minutes." Another crackle signified the end of the conversation.
"您需要裸体进行这些测试，因为我们直接监测您的身体。虽然会有摄像头，但它们将切换至热成像模式，不会看到您的身体，且测试途中不会有 NERV 人员在场。至于如何保持体面，您自己决定，但除了身体，测试室内不得携带任何物品，包括 A-10 弹夹。庆幸的是，今天您和真嗣不会共用一个插入栓。现在，请在五分钟内想出解决方案。"对话随着又一次的噼啪声结束。

"Goddamnit," Asuka muttered. "We can't go out there like..." She growled deep in her throat. "If I didn't know better I'd swear you thought this up, Glasses."
该死，" 明日香嘟囔着。"我们不能就这样出去……" 她从喉咙深处发出一声低吼。"要不是了解你，我真会以为这是你的主意，眼镜。

"Hey, I'm just as nervous about going out there naked as you, Soryu!" Kensuke retorted.
"嘿，我跟你一样，对于赤裸裸地走出去也感到紧张，Soryu！" 健介反驳道。

"I see no issue with this," Rei calmly remarked, her arms already going up as she peeled off her shirt.
"我没觉得这有什么问题，" Rei 平静地评论着，同时举起双臂，开始脱掉衬衫。

"Of course you wouldn't," sighed Asuka. "Alright alright, just... give me a second to think about this. There's gotta be a way we can do what Doctor Pervert wants and keep our dignity intact."
你当然不会这么做," 明日香叹息道。"行吧行吧, 让我想想... 肯定有办法既能满足那个变态博士, 又能保全我们的尊严。

"Might want to make it quick. I'm sure she's got something inventively nasty planned if we're late."
最好动作快些。我敢打赌，要是我们迟到，她肯定准备了些花样百出的恶作剧。

Shinji slowly unbuttoned his shirt, while his face steadily grew more and more hot out of pre-emptive embarrassment.
真嗣慢慢地解开衬衫的扣子，脸上不由自主地越来越热，预感到即将到来的尴尬。

"Okay, I've got something," Asuka finally announced. "You two boys will go first on my signal. You will look up, keeping just enough of what's ahead of you in view so you can still walk safely. Rei and I will go after you, doing the same. There will be no looking around until we're in our entry plugs, or I will be sticking my Eva's boot up your ass. Understood?"
好的，我有主意了，"明日香最终宣布道，"你们两个男生在我发出信号后先走。抬头看路，确保视野中保留足够的前方景象，以便安全行走。我和绫波会在你们之后跟上，同样保持这样的视线。在我们进入插入栓之前，不许东张西望，否则我会让我的 Eva 用靴子踢你们的屁股。明白了吗？

"Yes ma'am!" Kensuke replied. Though he wasn't looking, Shinji knew his friend had just ripped off a salute.
"是的，女士！" 健介应声回答。虽然没看，但真嗣能感觉到他的朋友刚刚行了一个利落的军礼。

Eventually, he managed to get the rest of his clothes off, by which point his face felt hot enough to boil water. At Asuka's call, he opened the door and stepped out, staring intently at the metal ceiling. Turning right, he lowered his gaze until he could see the back of Kensuke's head, and moved forward. Behind him, he heard the last two stall doors open followed by the sound of bare feet on the metal floor.
最终，他费力地脱掉了剩余的衣物，此时他的脸颊滚烫，仿佛能烧开水。听到明日香的呼唤，他打开门，步出隔间，目光紧锁在金属天花板上。向右转身后，他目光下移，直至看到健介的后脑勺，随即向前迈步。身后传来最后两个隔间门开启的声音，以及赤脚踏在金属地板上的声响。

"Asuka, are you-" Asuka，你是要-

"Not now, Wondergirl!" 现在不行，神奇小姑娘！

Shinji blinked at the ceiling, wondering if he should ask what was happening behind him before deciding he was better off not knowing.
真嗣眨巴着眼睛，凝视着天花板，心中犹豫是否该询问背后究竟发生了什么，最终还是觉得不知道或许更好。

"Oh yes, I forgot to mention," came Doctor Akagi's voice. "You'll need to pass through the decontamination room before you get into your plugs. Keep your eyes tightly closed when you're in there until we say otherwise, unless you want to go blind."
哦，对了，我差点忘了说，" 阿基医生提醒道，"进入驾驶舱前，你得先经过消毒室。在里面时，务必紧闭双眼，直到我们指示你睁开，否则有失明的风险。

When his feet felt a metal grate underneath them, Shinji realised they had reached the room in question. He soon sensed someone close behind him, and a door slid shut as lights flashed in the corners of the room. A second after he scrunched his eyes closed, what felt like a torrent of water sloshed over him and he struggled to keep his balance while being pummelled by the sudden tsunami.
当真嗣的脚触碰到金属格栅时，他意识到已经抵达了目标房间。紧接着，他感觉到有人紧随其后，随着房间角落灯光的闪烁，一扇门悄然关闭。他刚闭上眼睛，一股汹涌的水流便猛烈地冲刷过来，他努力稳住身形，抵抗着这突如其来的冲击。

Just as he was starting to wonder if NERV was trying to drown its pilots, the flood receded, leaving Shinji soaking wet, but that was soon remedied as the water was replaced by the surface of the sun. A light bright enough to almost be painful through his eyelids, accompanied by heat that reminded him of Mount Asama, filled the room for a few seconds until it mercifully shut off with a ding.
正当他怀疑 NERV 是否想用洪水淹没飞行员时，水位突然下降，留下浑身湿透的真嗣。不过，这情况很快得到缓解，因为房间内突然充满了如太阳表面般的光与热。那光线强烈到几乎能穿透眼皮带来痛感，热度则让人联想到浅间山的火山，持续了几秒后，随着一声“叮”响，一切又恢复了平静。

"Okay, you're all clean. Keep going."
好了，你已经很干净了。继续保持哦。

"Damn that was nasty," Kensuke remarked as they continued forward. "I feel like I lost a couple layers of skin back there."
真是恶心透了，" 健介边走边说。"我感觉在那儿皮肤都掉了好几层。

"We probably did," replied Asuka, sounding strangely like she was right next to Shinji's ear. "Decontamination is more than just a scrub in the shower." He could swear he felt her breath on his neck, but there was no chance in hell he was going to turn around.
"我们可能确实做了," 明日香回答, 声音仿佛就在真嗣耳畔。"去污远不止是简单的淋浴冲洗。" 他几乎能感觉到她的呼吸轻触他的颈项, 但无论如何他也不会转过身去。

The pilots rounded a corner, and Kensuke breathed a sigh of relief. "Here are the plugs," he announced. Since he was in the lead, there was no reason for him to stare up at the ceiling.
飞行员们转过拐角，健介如释重负地叹了口气。“插头就在这儿，”他宣布。既然是他领路，自然无需抬头望向天花板。

Shinji resisted the impulse to immediately look around; it wasn't safe just yet. He shuffled forward, waiting til he heard the sound of an entry plug open and close ahead of him, and then brought his gaze down from the ceiling.
真嗣克制住立刻四处张望的冲动，因为此刻并不安全。他缓缓前行，待听到前方插入栓开合的声音后，才将视线从天花板移开。

The four entry plugs were hanging in some kind of mechanical harness in front of holes that likely led back to the test chamber. With the furthest plug now occupied, Shinji clambered into the third one. Seconds after getting settled down in the seat, a video screen suddenly opened in front of Shinji as Misato spoke, scaring him for a moment and causing his hands to dart towards his lap before he realised it was a sound-only comm connection.
四个入口插头悬挂在某种机械吊带中，位于可能通往测试室的孔洞前。随着最远的插头被占据，真嗣爬进了第三个。刚在座位上坐稳，一个视频屏幕突然在真嗣面前弹出，美里的声音传来，让他一时惊慌，手不自觉地伸向膝盖，随后才意识到这只是音频通讯。

"Comm check. Everything okay so far?" Receiving a chorus of affirmatives, she continued. "In a moment we'll be bringing you into the test chamber. We'll be hooking you up to some simulation bodies and doing a few tests first, then linking you to your individual Evas. Shinji and Asuka, you two will be dual-synced to Unit-01 so we can run some tests on your link with each other. After that, we'll see if we can do a tentative activation test with Kensuke and Unit-00."
通讯确认。目前情况都还好吗？" 在得到一致的肯定答复后，她接着说："稍后我们将引导你们进入测试舱。首先，我们会将你们接入模拟躯体进行初步测试，随后与你们的专属 Eva 建立连接。真嗣和明日香，你们将双人同步至初号机，以便我们评估你们之间的协同效果。之后，我们计划与健介和零号机进行一次试探性的启动测试。

"Are you sure that's wise, Captain?" asked Rei.
"船长，你确定那样做明智吗？" 雷问道。

Ritsuko responded instead. "In what little spare time I've had, I've been trying to code out as much of the troublesome behaviour Unit-00 has exhibited in the past as possible. The next time we attempt an activation test, we shouldn't have to deal with a berserk Eva crippling its pilot. Hopefully."
理子接话道：“利用我那点儿零星时间，我正设法把零号机以往出现的各种棘手行为一一编码。希望下次进行启动测试时，我们不必再面对暴走的 Eva 伤害驾驶员的状况。”

"Umm..." Kensuke's nervous voice joined in. "I'm perfectly alright with waiting a bit longer, if it's alright with you."
呃……" 健介带着紧张的语气说道，"如果你方便的话，我完全可以再等等。

"You'll be fine. With the test plugs and simulation bodies you're perfectly safe. Probably."
你会安然无恙的。使用测试插头和模拟人体，你的安全有保障。应该没问题。

"Could you... err... please stop ending your sentences like that?"
你能不能...嗯...别再用那种方式结束句子了？

"I could do that. Maybe."
我或许能做那件事。

Shinji chuckled at Kensuke's discomfort as his plug began to move forward, presumably along a track of some kind. It soon stopped and tilted forward, and then the familiar entry plug insertion procedure began. The plug began to fill with LCL, so Shinji breathed out until his lungs were empty, waited for the LCL to pass over his head, and filled his lungs with the liquid. Even after all the times he'd had to do this, it was still disgusting.
真嗣看着健介因插入栓向前移动而显露的不适，不禁轻笑出声，这显然是沿着某种轨道进行的。插入栓很快停止并前倾，紧接着是熟悉的插入程序。随着 LCL 开始充满插入栓，真嗣呼出肺中空气，待液体漫过头顶后，便吸入这种液体。尽管已多次经历，这过程依旧令人反感。

The entry plug lit up and the metal shell disappeared as it linked to the simulation body, allowing Shinji to see through its eyes. Once again resisting the instinctive urge to cover himself, he looked around. Now the test chamber was occupied; it had been filled with a bluish liquid, and ahead of him he could see the window between the chamber and the control room. He-
插入栓亮起，金属外壳随之消失，与模拟体连接，让真嗣得以透过其双眼观察。他再次抑制住本能的遮掩冲动，环视四周。此刻，测试室内已注满蓝色液体，他面前便是测试室与控制室之间的观察窗。他-

…Huh... …呃...

Shinji rubbed his left arm. It seemed to have gone numb, as he couldn't feel the sensation of his right hand on it, even when he squeezed and poked it.
真嗣揉搓着左臂，感觉它已经麻木了，即使右手在上面挤压和戳弄，也丝毫没有知觉。

"What's going on? I can't feel my legs!"
怎么回事？我的腿没知觉了！

It sounded like Asuka was having a similar problem.
听起来，明日香好像也遇到了类似的问题。

"My arms have gone all funny."
我的胳膊感觉怪怪的。

Kensuke too. 健助也是这样。

"I am experiencing numbness in my left arm and leg."
我的左臂和腿感到麻木。

...And... Rei as well... ...还有...零也是一样...

What the hell was going on?
究竟是怎么回事？

As Asuka and Kensuke began to get louder, an authoritative voice cut them off. "Everybody relax!" Misato shouted.
随着明日香和健介的声音越来越大，一个威严的声音打断了他们。"大家都冷静点！" 美里大声说道。

"The numbness is simply a result of the state of your simulation bodies," said Doctor Akagi. "If you'll take a look, you can see that your numbness directly correlates to the limbs the bodies are missing."
赤木博士解释道：'这种麻木感只是模拟身体状态的反映。仔细观察，你们会发现麻木感与身体缺失的部位是一一对应的。'

Shinji turned his head, feeling like he was moving through treacle. Indeed, there was a noticeable lack of arm on his left side. Looking around, he saw that the other simulation bodies were similarly missing body parts. They actually looked somewhat desiccated, bare flesh and muscle stretched tight over the skeleton. It was easy to tell which body Asuka was in; one of them had nothing below the waist except a mass of dangling tubes.
真嗣转头时，感觉自己仿佛在糖浆中挣扎。他注意到自己的左臂不见了。环视周围，其他模拟体也都有肢体缺失，看起来干瘪，肌肉和皮肤紧贴着骨骼。一眼就能看出明日香所在的那个模拟体，其下半身只剩下一堆悬挂的管子。

This, naturally, did not seem to sit well with the Second Child.
这显然没有让第二个孩子感到满意。

"Why the hell are you giving us inferior equipment to work with?! How is any test supposed to be accurate under these conditions?!"
为什么偏偏给我们用这些劣质设备？这种条件下，测试结果怎么可能准确呢？！

"You won't be doing much movement," Doctor Akagi tersely replied. "In fact, practically the entire body is vestigial. All you really need to do is sit there and let us run our tests."
你几乎不需要动，"安城医生简洁地回应，"你的身体大部分功能已退化。只需静坐，让我们完成检测即可。

"Then what's the point of sticking us in here?" asked Kensuke. "Why did you make these bodies like this if they're not going to do anything?"
那把我们关在这里究竟有何意义？" 肯介追问。"如果这些身体无所作为，当初又何必费心塑造它们？

"They aren't custom-built testing devices." Shinji could sense strain returning to the scientist's voice. "These are failed Evangelion prototypes that have been repurposed for these tests. Now are you children going to settle down so we can actually get these tests under way?"
这些并非专门定制的测试设备。" 碇真嗣察觉到科学家语气中的紧张再度浮现。"这些都是失败的初代福音战士，现已被改造用于这些测试。孩子们，你们能否安静下来，好让我们正式开始测试？

"Please just calm down, Asuka," Misato almost pleaded. "As far as I can tell this will basically be like a regular harmonics test."
明日香，冷静点，" 美里几乎是在恳求，"据我所知，这基本上就是一次普通的谐波测试。

"Fine, fine." 行，行。

It was plain to hear that Asuka was not fine at all. Shinji almost wished he was in the plug with her, just to try and get her to relax a bit. Of course, if they were in the same plug, they would likely be incredibly edgy around each other considering their current state of dress.
很明显，明日香的状态并不好。真嗣甚至希望自己能和她共处一个插入栓，只为尝试让她放松些许。然而，若真如此，考虑到两人当前的着装，他们很可能会因为尴尬而变得异常紧张。

Now it was simply a matter of not falling asleep. Whatever tests were happening in the control room, Shinji couldn't sense anything happening. Whether this meant that things were going as expected or that they were failing one by one, he couldn't tell. As usual, the pilots were left out of the loop.
此刻，他只需保持清醒。控制室内的测试进展如何，真嗣毫无察觉。这可能意味着一切顺利，也可能意味着问题接踵而至，他无法判断。一如往常，驾驶员们对情况一无所知。

Eventually, it finally seemed like NERV deigned to recognise their existence.
最终，NERV 好像总算认可了他们的存在。

"Okay. Shinji and Asuka, we're going to try a little dual synchronisation," said Doctor Akagi.
"好的。真嗣、明日香，我们来试试双人同步协调，"赤木博士说道。

"Finally, something interesting."
终于，有些有趣的事情了。

Seconds later, Shinji's legs began to feel... strange.
几秒后，真嗣感觉到自己的腿有些异样。

"Whatever you've done, it's made my left arm feel wonky," Asuka announced, and Shinji reported something similar, along with his legs.
"不管你做了什么，我的左臂感觉怪怪的，" 明日香说道，真嗣也反映他的腿有类似的不适。

"As to be expected. Asuka, I want you to try and move your left leg. Point your foot out in front of you."
不出所料。明日香，试着动动你的左腿，把脚向前伸出来。

The strangeness in Shinji's legs increased slightly; the simulation body's left leg began to come up, and then his own left leg began to twitch. He rubbed a hand over it, but didn't feel anything.
真嗣感到双腿的不适略有加剧；模拟中的左腿开始抬起，紧接着他自己的左腿也跟着抽动起来。他伸手去揉，却毫无感觉。

"What the hell?! Something's feeling up my leg!"
天哪！什么东西在摸我的腿啊！

Shinji blinked in puzzlement. He stared down at his leg, then began to poke it, pushing a fingernail into the skin over his kneecap.
真嗣困惑地眨了眨眼，低头盯着腿，接着用指甲轻轻按压膝盖上的皮肤。

"...Shinji, are you poking your own knee right now?"
...真嗣，你这是在戳自己的膝盖吗？

The tone of Asuka's voice's made Shinji glad they weren't in the same plug. "Um... yes?"
明日香的声音让真嗣庆幸他们不在同一个驾驶舱内。"嗯...是的？"

"Hmm. Hey, in that case can you feel this?"
嗯，那在这种情况下，你能感受到这个吗？

A second later his left arm jerked as something seemed to hit it.
一秒后，他的左臂猛地一抽，像是被什么东西击中了。

"...Ow." If he were a more temperamental person, Shinji would have immediately retaliated by punching his own leg. But that would be starting a war he had no chance of winning, and in any case he would really only be hurting himself.
"...唉。" 若他性格更为冲动，或许真嗣会立刻捶打自己的腿以示反击。然而，这无异于自寻败局，最终受伤的也只是他自己。

"In-ter-est-ing." As was to be expected, Doctor Akagi seemed rather interested in their impromptu experimentation. "Despite being completely separated, not even in the same plug, you're now synchronised with each other to such a degree that you can affect each other physically."
挺有意思的。"不出所料，秋吉博士对他们即兴的实验表现出了浓厚的兴趣。"虽然完全分开，连插座都不是同一个，你们现在却能如此高度同步，以至于可以相互影响对方的物理状态。

"Whatever you've done, it feels... wrong," Shinji mumbled. "Can we please stop this now?"
不管你做了什么，总觉得...不太对，" 真嗣低声说。"我们能不能就此打住？

"Yeah, before this pervert gets any more dirty ideas."
对，得在那个家伙想出更多龌龊事之前。

And then alarms began blaring.
紧接着，警报声大作。

"Oh great, what now?" Asuka groaned, before levelling an accusatory glare at her fellow pilots. "Did one of you guys break something?"
哎，又出什么问题了？" 明日香不满地嘟囔着，随即用怀疑的眼神看向其他飞行员。"你们谁又弄坏了东西？

Shinji couldn't hear much from the control room besides a lot of people shouting technical things at each other. He could see Doctor Akagi running from terminal to terminal while Misato stayed at the window, looking frantically between the personnel and the simulation bodies. In the blue water of the test chamber, Shinji saw several drones enter through hatches in the walls and move to float in front of a pipe, pointing towards it. As if they were expecting an attack.
控制室里人声鼎沸，真嗣听不清具体内容，只听见众人互相喊着专业术语。赤木博士在各个终端间忙碌穿梭，而美里则站在窗前，目光在工作人员和模拟体之间来回扫视，显得十分焦急。在测试室的蓝色水域中，几架无人机从墙体舱门进入，漂浮至一根管道前，指向它，似乎在警戒着可能的袭击。

And then Asuka let out a scream.
接着，明日香尖叫了一声。

"Asuka?!" Shinji shouted, despite being drowned out by the noise in the control room. "What's going on?!"
明日香?!" 真嗣在控制室的嘈杂声中大声呼喊，"这是怎么回事?!

Asuka's simulation body was shifting around, its arms pressing against the wall of the test chamber as if it were trying to push itself away. Its right arm began to reach for the window of the control room, but then something exploded on the body, cutting the arm off at the shoulder. The next thing Shinji knew, he was being pushed into his seat as the connection to his own simulation body cut off. Somebody in the control room had finally initiated the ejection sequence. In the split second before his view went dark, Shinji saw the drones firing at the pipe.
明日香的模拟体在测试舱内挣扎移动，手臂紧贴舱壁，似乎想借此推开自己。其右臂正伸向控制室的观察窗，突然间，模拟体爆炸，右臂自肩部断裂。下一刻，真嗣感到一股力量将自己推回座位，与模拟体的连接骤然中断。控制室中的人终于触发了弹射程序。在视线陷入黑暗前的刹那，真嗣瞥见无人机正向管道开火。

There was an invisible hand on his chest, keeping him pinned to the seat as the entry plug shot up to wherever it was going. Finally, the hand deigned to let him go, but now Shinji felt the whole plug slowly spinning around, which wasn't helped by the internal socket constantly rotating to keep him 'down'.
一只无形的手按在胸前，将他紧紧压在座位上，随着插入栓疾速上升，不知去向何方。那只手终于松开，然而真嗣随即感到整个插入栓开始缓缓旋转，加之内部插座不断调整以维持他的“下位”，情况愈发复杂。

Just as he was about ready to test the LCL filter's ability to recycle the contents of his stomach, Shinji felt the plug jerk around as it breached the surface of... something. The plug's systems, evidently deciding everything was fine now, vented the LCL; he quickly took a breath and hacked up a lungful of gunk as the LCL dipped below head height.
就在真嗣即将测试 LCL 过滤器能否回收胃内容物之际，他感到插入栓猛地一晃，仿佛突破了某种界限。插入栓的系统似乎认为一切已恢复正常，随即排出了 LCL；他急忙深吸一口气，随着 LCL 液面降至头部以下，剧烈地咳出了一团黏液。

"What the hell was all that about?!" Asuka demanded as a sound-only comm window opened.
"这到底是怎么回事？！" 明日香的声音通过通讯窗口传来，只闻其声不见其人。

I don't know, but I think we got thrown out of the danger zone," Kensuke replied, his comm window opening next to Asuka's.
我不太确定，但我想我们应该是脱离了危险区，"健介回应着，他的通讯窗口随即在明日香旁边弹出。

"But where are we now?" Shinji asked. "And are we just supposed to sit here?"
我们现在究竟在哪里？" 真嗣问道。"难道我们就这样干坐着吗？

"Well there's no goddamn way I'm putting one foot outside of this plug naked!"
绝对不行，我可不会光着脚走出这个插座！

"I'm gonna go ahead and agree with that sentiment. Besides, my hatch is underwater."
我认同这个看法。而且，我的舱门已经浸在水里了。

"Yeah, mine's basically in the water too."
对，我的也差不多泡在水里了。

Shinji looked behind him. Because of the internal socket spinning him around during their escape, the plug hatch was now below and to the right. "Same here," he said.
真嗣回头一看，因为逃生时内部插座让他转了个身，现在插头舱门位于他的右下方。"我这边也是，"他回应道。

Another comm window opened. With video. Showing Rei's face. And Rei's shoulders. And Rei's-
另一个通讯窗口开启，视频中出现了绫的面容和肩部，还有绫的-

"Uh. Buh. Guh." 呃。嗯。啊。

"Fucking hell, First!" Asuka swore. "Sound only! Sound only!"
见鬼，抢先了！" 明日香喊道。"只听声音！只听声音！

Shinji jolted in his seat as he realised he was staring, and slapped a hand over his eyes.
意识到自己正盯着看，真嗣在座位上猛地一惊，急忙用手捂住了双眼。

"...Oh. Yes. Of course," Rei's voice seemed entirely unperturbed. "I still fail to see what your concern is, however."
...哦，是的，当然，" 绫的声音听起来波澜不惊。"不过，我还是没看出你有什么好担心的。

There was a nervous cough from Asuka. "Uh... okay boys, it's safe to look. And if I find out that you were staring-"
飞鸟紧张地清了清嗓子。"呃...好了，男孩们，现在可以看了。要是让我发现你们偷看的话——"

"Let me guess. Eva boot in our ass?"
我来猜猜。是不是 Eva 又给我们找麻烦了？

"Precisely." 正是如此。

Wisely deciding not to say a damn thing, Shinji slowly peeked through his fingers; indeed, Rei's video comm window had been replaced by another sound-only window.
明智地选择沉默，真嗣缓缓地从指缝中窥视；果然，绫波的视频通讯窗口已被另一个只播放声音的窗口替换。

"As I was about to say," said Rei. "My hatch is out of the water. I can go see where we are."
我正要说，" 雷伊说道，"我的舱门已脱离水面。我去看看我们现在所处的位置。

"Just stick your head out then," replied Asuka. "Don't go giving any potential onlookers a free show."
你只需探出头来，"飞鸟回应说，"别让旁人白白看热闹。

"Very well." There was the sound of metal on metal, a few seconds of silence, then more metal noises. "We are in the Geofront lake. There appears to be nobody around, even on the destroyer, and I cannot hear any alarms."
情况良好。" 先是金属撞击声，随后是几秒的静默，接着又响起金属声。"我们身处地下湖，四周似乎空无一人，驱逐舰上也无人影，且未听到任何警报。

"...Well what are we supposed to do now?" asked Kensuke. "Are we supposed to get out and swim and run to our Evas naked?"
那我们现在该怎么办？" 健介问道。"难道要我们裸着身子游过去，再跑到各自的 Eva 那里吗？

"This is an emergency evacuation point," said Rei. "If we are here, then we are meant to stay here. Had we been needed in our Evas, we would have been directed towards them."
这里是紧急疏散点，"雷说道，"既然我们在此，就应坚守岗位。若需驾驶 Eva 机甲，自会有人引导我们前往。

"Oh just fucking great," Asuka moaned. "More sitting around and waiting."
哦，真是太好了，" 明日香嘟囔着。"又是无所事事地干等。

"...I cannot reach command," noted Rei after a few moments. "Not even the MAGI. I presume they are too busy combating this threat."
...我联系不上指挥系统，"雷过了一会儿说道。"连 MAGI 系统也联系不上。我猜它们正忙于对抗这个威胁。

"Everyone in NERV could be dead now, for all we know," Kensuke darkly mused. "Whatever this thing is that attacked, it came out of nowhere inside the Geofront. What if it's some sort of... plague or virus thing?"
NERV 的每个人现在可能都已经丧命，我们一无所知，" 健介忧心忡忡地思索着。"这个不明攻击者突然从 Geofront 内部出现。万一它是一种... 瘟疫或病毒呢？

"You think the Angels have just suddenly gone from big stompy monsters to something infectious?"
你认为天使们突然从庞大的踩踏怪物变成了具有传染性的存在吗？

"Is there anything to say that that couldn't have happened?"
有什么能证明那件事不可能发生的说法吗？

"Considering how little we know of the Angels, such an event is not entirely impossible."
鉴于我们对天使知之甚少，这样的事件并非全无可能。

"Wow, pessimists the lot of you. Guess it's up to me to be the optimistic one. They can't be dead that easily, they're obviously just busy containing the threat. Let's at least give NERV a couple hours before writing them off. The backup power in an entry plug can last sixteen hours if everything's shut down bar life support."
你们都太悲观了。我觉得他们不会那么轻易就出事，应该是在忙于控制局面。我们至少给 NERV 几个小时的时间，别急着下定论。插入栓内的备用电源，如果只维持生命支持系统，能持续十六个小时。

Shinji tried to make himself comfortable on his seat, absently tuning out his fellow pilots while the leftover LCL started to dry on his skin.
真嗣在座位上尽量让自己舒服，心不在焉地忽略了其他驾驶员，皮肤上残留的 LCL 逐渐干燥。

"Fine by me. But what are we supposed to do in the meantime?"
我没问题。不过，这段时间我们该做些什么呢？

"What's there to do?" asked Asuka. "We can't exactly play 'I Spy' like this."
我们还能做什么呢？" 明日香问道。"这种情况下，'我猜我猜'游戏显然玩不了。

He was starting to wish the LCL had stayed in the plug. At least then he wouldn't be feeling so... icky.
他开始希望 LCL 没有被排出。那样至少他不会感到如此... 不适。

"Twenty Questions then?" 那么，是二十个问题吗？

"Pass." 批准。

Shinji glanced back at the hatch. As much as he wanted to get some fresh air in the plug before the usual stink of dried LCL began to permeate it, the position of the hatch prevented it. And as cleansing as water was, it was not a breathable liquid.
真嗣回头望向舱门。他本想趁插头里干 LCL 的异味尚未扩散前透透气，无奈舱门的位置不允许。水虽能净化，却终究不是可呼吸的液体。

"Rei? any suggestions?" Rei，你有什么建议吗？

"Sorry, I cannot think of anything to pass the time."
抱歉，我实在想不出有什么可以打发时间的。

Shinji blinked, looking around at the interior of the entry plug itself. The socket that kept the pilot right-side-up according to gravity ended right behind the seat, with the rest of the plug behind it being mostly blank metal. The plug itself would be heavy, but clearly not so heavy that it would sink. He got out of the seat, gingerly testing his weight as he headed towards the back of the plug. It didn't seem to be shifting much at all; a reassuring thought given the idea brewing in his head.
真嗣眨了眨眼，环视插入栓内部。座椅后方是维持驾驶员正立的重力插座，其后则是大片空白的金属壁。插入栓虽重，却不至于沉没。他起身离开座位，小心地试探着步伐，向后方移动。插入栓几乎未见晃动，这让他心中酝酿的想法稍感安心。

He placed his hands on the wall of the plug, leaned forward, and slowly started putting one foot in front of the other. The entry plug gradually began to spin, and Shinji smiled as his plan came to fruition. He picked up the pace, considering if he could actually get ashore like this. It was certainly more interesting than sitting around doing nothing, and it could result in one less plug to fish out of the middle of the lake.
他双手撑在插入栓的内壁上，身体前倾，开始缓缓地一步步向前挪动。随着插入栓逐渐旋转起来，真嗣的计划得以实现，他不禁微笑。他加快了脚步，心中思索着或许真能借此上岸。这比干坐着有趣多了，而且或许能省去湖中打捞一个插入栓的麻烦。

And then, a few minutes later, something he should have expected to happen, happened.
随后不久，那件他本该预料到的事情，果然发生了。

The plug hit something with a dull and hollow metal clang, the impact causing Shinji to stumble a bit.
插头撞上某物，发出沉闷的金属回响，震得真嗣脚步踉跄。

"What the hell was that?!"
那到底是什么鬼东西?!

"What happened, Pilot Soryu?"
怎么了，飞行员 Soryu？

"Something just smacked into my plug! Are we being rescued already?"
刚刚有什么东西撞到了我的插座！难道我们已经被救援了吗？

"I shall check." 我会检查一下。

Too embarrassed to say anything, Shinji simply stood where he was as his face heated up. The Geofront lake was massive, and yet somehow he'd still managed to bump into somebody else. And Asuka of all people...
尴尬得无言以对，真嗣呆立在原地，脸颊发热。Geofront 的湖面广阔，却不知怎的，他还是撞上了人，偏偏是明日香...

Rei came back on the comm. "It... appears that one of our plugs has spontaneously moved and collided with another."
丽通过通讯传来消息：“看起来，我们的一个插头不知怎么自己动了，还撞上了另一个。”

"Well considering that it hit me, and you're able to look out and see both of us... Oi Glasses, I bet that was you somehow."
既然它打中了我，而你又能看到我们俩...喂，戴眼镜的那位，我猜这事儿肯定和你有关。

"What?! I'm just sitting here not doing a thing!"
什么？！我就坐这儿，啥也没干！

"Well then obviously it was-"
那么显然就是-

Shinji finally got his brain to correctly re-interface with his mouth. "Y-yeah... it was me, Asuka," he said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head.
真嗣总算让大脑和嘴巴重新协调了。“呃……对，是我，明日香，”他有些不好意思地说，同时挠了挠头。

Even through the comm system, Asuka sounded incredulous. "...Just how did you manage to hit my plug with yours?! We don't have control of the ejection thrusters or anything."
即便通过通讯系统，明日香的声音依旧透露出难以置信。"...你到底是怎么用你的插入栓撞上我的？！我们并没有操控弹射推进器或其他任何设备。"

Sighing softly, Shinji went back to his seat so as to be closer to the comm's audio pickup. "I wanted to open my plug up to get some fresh air in, but the hatch was in the wrong spot to open safely. So I decided to spin the plug and... well... I got kinda carried away."
真嗣轻声叹息，回到座位，以便更靠近通讯设备的麦克风。"我本想打开舱门透透气，但舱门位置不安全，无法开启。于是我尝试旋转舱体，结果...一不小心就转过头了。"

"You... spun the plug?" Asuka's tone changed. It now sounded, dare he say it, impressed. "And you got it moving... Oh Shinji you clever little bastard!"
你...竟然转动了插头？" 明日香的语气中透露出惊讶。现在听起来，他敢肯定，是佩服的。"而且你真的让它动起来了...哦，真嗣，你真是太机灵了！

He didn't know whether to feel complimented or insulted.
他拿不准自己是该感到荣幸还是受辱。

"Wait, what am I missing here?" Kensuke cut in. "How'd he spin it?"
等等，我忽略了什么？" 健介打断道，"他是怎么圆场的？

"Ever seen a hamster wheel?" replied Asuka. "Shinji just used his brain and kinetic energy."
你见过仓鼠跑轮吗？" 明日香回应说，"真嗣就是运用了他的智慧和身体动能。

"Hamster-... Aaaah I see now! But so what... oh, you're planning something aren't you?"
仓鼠...啊，我明白了！不过，那又如何...哦，你是不是在打什么主意？

"Damn right. I'd rather be doing something than just sitting on my ass. Wondergirl, can you take a look around and see which shore is closest for us?
说得太对了。我宁愿忙起来，也不愿无所事事。神奇女孩，麻烦你观察一下，告诉我们哪边的海岸离我们最近。

"Okay." 好的。

"Shore?" Shinji repeated. It seemed that Asuka was now getting the same idea he had.
"岸边？" 新重复道。看来明日香此刻也产生了与他相同的念头。

Though he couldn't see her, Shinji knew Asuka had just shrugged nonchalantly. "Yeah, let's see if we can roll these plugs right out of the water. Gives us something to do, and it'll take a while since these plugs aren't exactly paddle steamers."
虽然看不见她，但真嗣能感觉到明日香刚刚漫不经心地耸了耸肩。“行吧，试试看能不能把这些插入栓滚出水面。找点事做，这活儿可不像划桨船那么快，得慢慢来。”

"The closest shoreline is on your left, Pilot Soryu," said Rei. "The slope should be slight enough for us to leave the water. However, our plugs are not all aligned the same. All four of us are roughly abreast, but my plug is angled more to the right than yours and Pilot Aida's is angled more left and slightly in front."
最近的岸边在你的左侧，Soryu 飞行员，" Rei 说道。"坡度应该足够平缓，我们可以离开水面。不过，我们四人的插入位置并不完全一致。虽然我们大致并排，但我的位置比你和 Aida 飞行员的更偏右，而 Aida 飞行员的则更偏左且略微靠前。

"But we could still roughly all go the same way, right?"
我们还是能大致同向而行，没错吧？

"Correct." 没错。

"Wait a second," Kensuke thoughtfully said. "If I push my plug into yours, Rei, would that realign us enough?"
稍等，" 健介沉思着说。"如果我把我的插头接入你的，零，这样能使我们重新对齐吗？

"Hmm. Give me a moment." An awkward silence descended upon the comm system for a good couple of minutes before Rei returned. "Based on the position of our plugs, I believe that colliding with my plug would alter your angle so that the two of us are parallel. Then, we could push in the direction of Pilots Soryu and Ikari to align ourselves with them. Together, we would then be able to get ashore at the same place."
嗯，稍等一下。"通讯系统陷入了短暂的尴尬沉默，几分钟后丽再次发言。"根据我们插头的位置，如果我的插头与你的发生碰撞，应该能调整你的角度，使我们俩平行。接着，我们可以一起向飞行员 Soryu 和 Ikari 的方向推进，确保我们与他们保持同一直线。这样，我们就能在同一地点安全上岸。

Shinji raised an eyebrow. Rei sounded surprisingly enthusiastic about the entire thing. Her voice actually raised slightly in pitch as she spoke.
真嗣微微挑眉。绫波对这件事显得异常热情，说话时声音的音调也略微上扬。

"Awesome!" Asuka eagerly chimed in. Right about now she would probably be pumping a fist, if Shinji knew her as well as he thought he did. "Then get your hatch closed, Wondergirl, and let's get this ridiculous show on the road! Or... water!"
太好了！"明日香迫不及待地插话。按她平时的性子，这会儿估计正握拳鼓劲呢，真嗣对此心知肚明。"那就关好舱门，奇迹女孩，让我们开始这场荒诞的演出吧！哦不，是水上表演！

It took a few minutes before Shinji finally heard the sound of metal on metal indicating that another entry plug had just collided with his.
几分钟后，真嗣才听到金属与金属碰撞的声响，这意味着另一个插入栓刚刚撞上了他的。

"We should all be parallel now," reported Rei a few seconds later.
"我们现在都应该保持同步，"Rei 几秒钟后报告道。

"Then it's time to row for shore! Last one there's a rotten egg!"
现在该划向岸边了！最后一名可是臭鸡蛋哦！

Asuka sounded as if she were preparing to fight an Angel, causing Shinji to give a small grin at her infectious attitude as he once again placed his hands against the wall of the plug and 'walked' forward.
明日香的声音仿佛在备战使徒，她那充满活力的态度让真嗣不禁露出微笑，他再次将手撑在插入栓壁上，继续前行。

"Hey wait a minute!" 嘿，稍等一下！

The grin widened involuntarily as Kensuke caught on.
健介意识到后，不由自主地笑得更开了。

It felt like it took forever before Shinji felt the sudden resistance of solid ground beneath his plug. The effort required to roll the plug greatly increased now that he wasn't fighting against mere water, but eventually the ground seemed to even out.
似乎过了很久，真嗣才突然感觉到插入栓下方坚实地面的阻力。现在不仅要对抗水流，还要推动插入栓，所需的努力大大增加，但最终地面似乎平坦了。

"Hey rotten egg, you out of the water yet?" Asuka inquired a minute later.
"嘿，小懒虫，你还没从水里出来吗？" 明日香一分钟后问道。

"Yeah, I-... oh screw you Soryu!"
行了，我...真是的，Soryu，你够了！

Asuka cackled, then said, "Everyone make sure to get your hatches facing upward before stopping so we can open them. Keep rolling against the next plug if you have to."
明日香笑着说：“大家停下前记得让舱门朝上，这样我们才能打开。必要的话，就继续滚动到下一个插头。”

Shinji looked up; his hatch was right where it needed to be, so he stepped away from the wall of the plug with a thankful sigh. He heard and felt Rei's plug shifting against his for a moment before that too settled down.
碇真嗣抬头一看，自己的舱口恰到好处，他便带着一丝感激的叹息，从插入栓的墙壁边退开。他同时感受到绫波的插入栓与自己的轻轻碰撞，片刻后也归于平静。

"Right, we can finally air these tin cans out! And no peeking!"
好了，我们终于可以把这些罐头拿出来透透气了！不许偷看！

"I know, I know. Eva, boot, etcetera."
我明白，我明白。伊娃，靴子，诸如此类。

With great relief, Shinji opened his hatch. The cool air coming in felt wonderful on his body after far too long trapped in a metal tube full of recycled air. He looked at the pilot seat; to his disappointment there didn't seem to be any way to shift it towards the hatch.
真嗣如释重负地打开了舱门，久违的清新空气拂过身体，让他感到格外舒爽。他望向驾驶座，却失望地发现，无法将其移近舱门。

"Before any of you ask, I have just attempted to contact command again," said Rei, her voice coming through both the comm and the open hatch. "There is still no response."
在你们提问之前，我刚又试了一次联系指挥部，" Rei 说道，她的声音通过通讯设备和敞开的舱门传来。"还是没有回应。

"Whatever's happened, it's damn serious then," Asuka remarked. "Otherwise they would have at least sent us a message."
看来发生的事情非同小可，" 明日香说道。"不然他们至少会发个消息通知我们。

"Could it be a cyber attack of some kind?" asked Kensuke. "That could explain why they're so silent, if everything's either shut down or offline."
会不会是某种网络攻击？" 健介疑惑地问。"如果所有系统都关闭或无法连接，那他们沉默的原因也就说得通了。

"I doubt that," replied Asuka. "The only thing powerful enough to attack the MAGI is another MAGI system. And at that point you've clearly managed to somehow piss off an entire NERV branch."
我对此持怀疑态度，"飞鸟回应说。"能攻击 MAGI 系统的，只有另一套 MAGI 系统。而你已经不知怎么得罪了整个 NERV 分部。

Everybody fell silent, either out of concern for the people they knew in NERV or for simply having nothing else to say. Shinji returned to his pilot seat and tried to make himself comfortable once more. Now that he could, mostly, hear the others without the comm system, he flicked it off. The bright holographic screens vanished, leaving a few blinking lights and the artificial Geofront daylight streaming in through the hatch as the only light source. He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking back to the test chamber.
众人陷入沉默，或是出于对 NERV 中熟人的担忧，或是无话可说。真嗣回到驾驶座，再次调整坐姿以求舒适。既然现在不依赖通讯系统也能大致听到他人声音，他便将其关闭。明亮的 holographic 屏幕随之消失，只剩下几盏闪烁的灯光和透过舱口洒入的人造 Geofront 日光，成为仅有的光源。他闭目片刻，脑海中浮现出测试室的场景。

The dual synchronisation he had with Asuka was starting to become somewhat concerning. Whatever Doctor Akagi had done, it had allowed them both to essentially interact with each other's bodies. All he could hope was that that wasn't implemented going forth. Things were constantly getting awkward between them enough without Asuka constantly accusing him of touching her.
他与明日香之间的双重同步逐渐引起了担忧。赤木博士的所作所为，使得他们能够实质上操控对方的身体。他只希望这种情况不会持续下去。他们之间本就尴尬频发，再加上明日香不断指责他触碰她，情况更是雪上加霜。

And then there was- 接着那里出现了-

Something banged on the hull of his entry plug. "Hey Shinji!"
他的插入栓外壳突然被什么东西撞击了。"嘿，真嗣！"

"Bwuh?" 什么？

The suddenness of the interruption practically propelled Shinji out of his seat. He looked towards the hatch and saw some clothes laying directly under it.
突如其来的打断几乎让真嗣从座位上跳了起来。他望向舱口，发现一些衣物就放在它正下方。

"Did you doze off or something?" came Asuka's voice. "NERV's finally sorted itself out and come for us, so get dressed and get your ass out here!"
你是不是打瞌睡了？" 明日香的声音响起。"NERV 已经整顿完毕，来接我们了，快穿好衣服，麻利点出来！

Shinji blinked. Had he fallen asleep? Surely it had only been a few minutes since they'd gotten their plugs onto dry land. He roughly shook his head before reaching for the clothes. They weren't his own -rather they seemed to be a standard issue NERV shirt and trousers- but it was better than the nothing he currently had.
真嗣眨了眨眼，心想自己是不是睡着了。明明他们才刚把插入栓安置到陆地上，时间应该没过多久。他用力摇了摇头，伸手去拿衣服。那些并非他的私人物品，而是 NERV 的标准制服——一件衬衫和一条裤子，但总比赤身裸体好。

Once appropriately dressed for polite company, Shinji climbed out of the entry plug. His feet almost immediately lost grip on the metal hull, sending him sliding into the gap between his plug and Asuka's where he landed rather unceremoniously on his ass. A shadow fell over him.
穿戴整齐后，真嗣从插入栓中爬出。不料，双脚刚踏上金属外壳便滑脱，他顺势滑入自己与明日香插入栓间的空隙，颇为狼狈地跌坐在地。此时，一道阴影笼罩了他。

"Nice dismount," Asuka remarked, before extending a hand.
"漂亮的着陆，" 明日香称赞道，随后伸出了手。

She was similarly attired, as were Rei and Kensuke when Shinji raised his head to look. He sighed and took the help to get out of the gap and onto solid ground, and the two of them headed over to where the other two pilots and a group of NERV personnel were standing by a small convoy of vehicles. Misato, seeing them approach, halted her conversation with Lieutenant Aoba and a rather frazzled-looking Lieutenant Ibuki and walked over to Shinji and Asuka.
她穿着与绫波和健介相同的装束，当真嗣抬头望去时，他们也是如此。他叹息一声，接受了帮助，从缝隙中脱身，踏上了稳固的地面，随后两人一同前往另外两位驾驶员及一群 NERV 人员所在的地方，那里停靠着一小队车辆。美里见他们走来，便中断了与青叶中尉以及显得有些焦躁的伊吹中尉的交谈，向真嗣和明日香迎去。

"Here we were, all prepped to sail out and pick you kids up, and we get here to find out you did our job for us!" Misato looked around at the plugs, and then shrugged. "Eh, whatever works I guess. How are you kids doing?"
我们本已准备就绪，打算出海去接你们，没想到你们已经把活儿干完了！" 碇真嗣环顾着周围的插入栓，随后耸了耸肩。"算了，能解决问题就行。你们都还好吧？

Asuka airily waved a hand. "We're fine," she replied. "Got a bit boring though, especially since we were kicked out of the party."
明日香随意地挥了挥手，“我们挺好的，”她答道，“就是有点无聊，尤其是被赶出派对后。”

Misato gave her a look and shook her head. "Trust me, the other guests were not friendly. You would have had a lousy time."
真嗣看了她一眼，摇了摇头。“相信我，其他客人都不友好。你肯定会玩得不开心。”

One of the NERV technicians walked over to Shinji and Asuka, holding two water bottles and some energy bars which he gave to them.
一位 NERV 的技术人员拿着两瓶水和几根能量棒，走到真嗣和明日香面前，递给了他们。

"What actually happened, anyway?" asked Shinji as he twisted the lid off his bottle. "All we know is that something attacked NERV and that, basically, we weren't needed."
到底发生了什么事？" 碇真嗣拧开瓶盖时问道。"我们只知道有东西攻击了 NERV，而实际上，我们似乎并不被需要。

Misato scratched her head for a moment, then said, "An Angel infiltrated NERV as... some sort of nanomachine swarm, resisted all initial attempts at neutralisation and managed to partially infect the MAGI. Doctor Akagi eventually managed to science it to death before it could force a self-destruct."
真嗣挠了挠头，接着说道：“一个使徒伪装成纳米机器集群潜入了 NERV，抵挡住了所有初期清除措施，并部分感染了 MAGI 系统。幸亏赤木博士及时用科学方法将其彻底消灭，才避免了它启动自毁程序。”

"Wait..." Kensuke hurriedly swallowed his mouthful of food and bounded over. "Nanomachine swarm? Infecting the MAGI?" He turned to Asuka with a victorious grin. "I was right! The MAGI got hacked!"
等等..." 健介匆匆咽下口中的食物，快步走过去。"是纳米机器人群？侵入了 MAGI 系统？" 他转向明日香，露出胜利的笑容。"看吧，我说中了！MAGI 真的被黑了！

"Hacked?" Lieutenant Ibuki repeated, with an air of disbelief. "You want to hack the MAGI? Good luck, they're behind seven firewalls, not to mention other safeguards I can't tell you about. No, this Angel was a biological organism, and it infected the organic components of the MAGI."
"被黑了？" 伊吹中尉重复道，语气中带着怀疑。"你想黑进 MAGI？那可不容易，它们有七层防火墙，还有其他我不能透露的安全措施。这个使徒是个生物体，它感染了 MAGI 系统中的有机组件。

The look Asuka shot Kensuke was a mirror image of the one he had just given to her.
明日香投向健介的眼神，与他刚才投向她的如出一辙。

Ibuki ran a hand through her hair. "Anyway, the crisis is averted, but the tests will need to be abandoned for the foreseeable future, seeing as we need to rebuild the Pribnow Box. Again."
伊吹用手梳理了一下头发，说道：“总之，危机已经过去了，但由于我们得重新搭建普里布诺盒，测试工作在近期内恐怕无法进行了。”

"Oh no," Asuka said in a monotone to match Rei. "We won't get to be tested while naked again."
哎呀，" 明日香面无表情地附和着零号机，"看来我们没机会再裸着接受测试了。

"What a shame," Kensuke added in a similar tone.
"真是遗憾，" 健介以相似的口吻补充道。

"Absolutely hilarious, you two," Misato quipped.
"你们俩真是太逗了，" 碇真嗣打趣说。

"Fortunately, we did manage to gather some useful data," said Ibuki. "So we'll just have to go with what we got."
幸运的是，我们总算收集到了一些有用的数据，"伊吹说道。"接下来，我们只能依靠这些数据了。

As one, Shinji and Asuka turned worried expressions on each other. Shinji was the first to speak up. "Um... can I please ask that you not implement whatever it was that let us... poke each other? It was really distracting. And... you know, kind of an invasion of each other's privacy."
真嗣和明日香同时看向对方，脸上都写满了忧虑。真嗣率先打破沉默：“那个...能不能请您不要启用那种让我们...互相触碰的功能？这实在太让人分心了。而且...您也明白，这多少侵犯了我们的个人隐私。”

"A teenage boy turning down something like that?" Aoba wondered aloud. "You... no, I'm not Captain Katsuragi, I won't go there."
一个少年会拒绝这种事？" 青叶不禁脱口而出。"你...不，我不是葛城队长，我不会深究。

Misato stuck her tongue out at him.
真嗣对她吐了吐舌头。

"You'll be happy to know that that test wasn't done with the intent to implement such a 'feature', but rather to prevent it," said Ibuki. "Your dual synchronisation is still not fully understood. With what we learned today, we hope to actually filter out that sort of thing, to try and keep you two separate in case of another... fusion incident."
您会很高兴得知，那次测试并非旨在引入那种'功能'，而是为了预防其发生，"伊吹解释道。"你们的双重同步机制仍未完全明了。基于今日的发现，我们希望能过滤掉此类情况，以防再次出现...融合事故。

"Oh." Asuka blinked. "Well... that's good. So you're sure I won't ever have to worry about suddenly feeling this pervert's hands running all over me?"
哦。" 明日香眨了眨眼。"那挺好的。你确定我不会再突然感受到这个变态的手在我身上乱摸了？

Shinji coughed up the mouthful of water he'd been just about to swallow. "A-Asuka, I-I would never do something like... like that!"
真嗣咳出了差点咽下的那口水，急忙辩解："A-Asuka，我-我怎么可能做出那种事！"

"Well I wouldn't mind if a man could do that to me," Misato mused, staring off into the distance with a grin on her face. This only made Shinji's face even hotter, and Asuka's cheeks started to pink up as well.
"如果有个男人能那样对我，我倒也不介意。" 美里若有所思地微笑着，目光飘向远方。这使得真嗣的脸颊愈发滚烫，连带着明日香的脸颊也泛起了红晕。

Aoba turned his head away and rather deliberately cleared his throat.
青叶扭过头，有意地清了清喉咙。

"Oh. Right." Getting back on topic, Misato said, "The pilots are safe, and all we need to do is haul the plugs back where they belong. Oh, and retrieve the Evangelions too."
哦，对了。" Misato 回到正题，说道："驾驶员们都安然无恙，我们只需将插入栓归位，并回收那些福音战士。

"Huh?" Shinji and Asuka said at the same time. Asuka continued on alone. "What did you do with our Evas?"
咦？" 真嗣和明日香异口同声。明日香接着独自追问："你对我们驾驶的 Eva 动了什么手脚？

"Commander Ikari ordered the Evas to be launched to prevent the Angel infecting them as well," said Ibuki. "They're sitting on the bottom of the lake right now."
指挥官碇命令启动 EVA，以防使徒也感染它们，"伊吹说道，"它们此刻正沉在湖底。

The water was too dark for Shinji to see anything, but he didn't see any reason to disbelieve her. "How deep is this lake?" he asked of nobody in particular.
水太暗，真嗣什么也看不见，但他没有理由不相信她。“这湖到底有多深？”他随口问道。

"Deep enough that even an Eva would be up to their chest in water," replied Aoba.
"深到足以让 Eva 都淹到胸口，" Aoba 回答说。

Ibuki glanced at her watch. "Well, since everything's well in hand here I need to head back and help Doctor Akagi check the MAGI for any lingering problems. She needs to report to Commander Ikari soon as well."
伊吹瞥了一眼手表，说道：“既然这里一切都在掌控之中，我得回去协助赤木博士检查 MAGI 系统，确保没有遗留问题。她还得尽快向碇司令汇报情况。”

Misato made a face. "Wouldn't like to be in her shoes right now, after an Angel slipped right into NERV."
真嗣做出一副表情。"这时候可不想站在她的立场上，毕竟有个使徒潜入了 NERV。"

XXX

"The Angel apparently got in on some sheets of metal used in the Pribnow Box's renovation," said Ritsuko. "Anybody who saw it passed it off as rust or corrosion, and evidently didn't think it worth mentioning to somebody."
天使似乎是利用了用于普里布诺盒翻新的几块金属板潜入的，"里津子解释道。"那些目击者都误以为是锈迹或腐蚀，显然觉得这事不值一提。

"Find out who noticed and said nothing, and terminate their employment immediately," replied Commander Ikari, glancing to his right at Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. "This situation was entirely preventable."
查明哪些人知情不报，立即解雇他们，"伊卡里指挥官回应道，并向右看了一眼副指挥官 Fuyutsuki。"这种情况本可完全避免。

"Understood sir," the older man said with a nod. "The first I noticed of it was when Lieutenant Hyuga brought it to my attention. Though I must confess that I too thought it was simply corrosion. I'll see to the dismissals right away."
明白了，先生，" 年长者点头说道，"我最初注意到这一点是在日向中尉向我提出时。尽管我得承认，起初我也以为是腐蚀。我会立刻着手处理解雇事宜。

Ritsuko frowned slightly as Fuyutsuki left. Only the fact that he was the Sub-Commander prevented her from calling him out on his laziness. "Well it's dead now, and I'm almost disappointed there's nothing left of it to analyse."
律子眉头微蹙，目送冬月离去。若不是他身为副司令，她早就直言不讳地批评他的懒散了。"如今它已消亡，我竟有些遗憾，因为已无物可供分析。"

"No trace of it remains in the MAGI system?" asked Ikari.
"在 MAGI 系统中真的没有留下任何痕迹吗？"伊卡里追问道。

He was still sitting in that same damn pose he liked; hunched forward and covering his mouth with his hands, like he was afraid his own teeth were trying to escape or something.
他依旧保持着那个他偏爱的姿势，身体前倾，双手捂嘴，好像生怕自己的牙齿会逃脱一般。

"Nothing that I've been able to find," replied Ritsuko. "But I've got several high level diagnostics running over the next few days to try and catch anything. Even the slightest discrepancy will be noted and looked into."
我目前还没发现什么异常，" Ritsuko 回应说。"不过，我安排了几个高级诊断程序在未来几天内进行，以便捕捉任何可能的问题。任何细微的偏差都会被记录下来并深入调查。

"Very well. Have you also purged all information about this breach?"
很好。关于这次泄露的所有信息你都清除干净了吗？

"I just finished doing that before coming here, sir."
先生，我刚做完那件事就赶过来了。

"Good." Finally, Ikari did something other than sit and stare at her. He got out of his chair and walked over to the floor-length window, where he clasped his hands behind his back and stared out at the Geofront. "The Council is going to stick their noses in where they don't belong. I don't want them to be able to sniff out anything."
好的。" 终于，碇不再只是坐着凝视她。他从椅子上站起，走向落地窗，双手背在身后，凝视着第三新东京市。"委员会又要插手不该他们管的事了。我不想让他们察觉到任何蛛丝马迹。

Rather than shouting across the ridiculously large room, Ritsuko chose to move past the desk and stop a few meters away from the man. "As far as the MAGI are concerned, the Angel alarm sensor grid malfunctioned. The MAGI are being checked for errors as well, since they clearly didn't verify the alert before informing the Council."
与其在偌大的房间里高声呼喊，理佐子宁可绕过办公桌，在离男子几米处驻足。“关于 MAGI 系统，天使警报传感器网络发生了故障。目前 MAGI 也在接受错误排查，因为它们显然未在向委员会报告前核实警报。”

"Hrm." Ikari's head turned slightly as his gaze shifted towards the lake where the entry plugs were being recovered. "There is a folder on my desk for Major Katsuragi. See that she receives it."
嗯。"碇的头微微一转，目光投向正在回收插入栓的湖面。"我桌上有个文件夹，是给葛城少校的，务必转交给她。

Ritsuko glanced at the desk to see the folder in question. "Of course sir." She moved over to pick it up but stopped, her hand hovering over it. "...Sir? Major Katsuragi?" she asked, looking back at him.
律子瞥向桌面，目光落在那个文件夹上。“当然，长官。”她走近欲取，却中途停下，手悬在文件夹上方。“...长官？葛城少校？”她转头询问。

Ikari gave a fractional nod. "Correct. As the Head of Tactical Operations it's high time she received a promotion."
碇微微颔首，表示认同。“确实如此。身为战术行动部的部长，她早该获得提拔了。”

Ritsuko's fingers twitched. Did he know...
理子手指微微一颤。他是否知情...

"I am choosing to pretend the incident with Rei's medication never happened," Ikari continued. He turned his head to look at Ritsuko over his shoulder, a hint of a smirk on his face. "I did not get to where I am today by being ignorant, Doctor; I know what happened during Israfel's attack."
我决定装作绫波的药物事件从未发生，"碇继续说，转头从肩膀上方向律子投去目光，脸上带着一丝得意的微笑。"博士，我之所以能有今天的成就，并非因为我无知；伊斯拉斐尔袭击时的情况，我心知肚明。

"...And you're still choosing to promote her despite what she did?"
...尽管她做了那样的事，你还是决定要推广她吗？

"Katsuragi was acting out of some sense of concern, misplaced though it was, not malice or stupidity. Besides, you know as well as I how replaceable the First Child is."
葛城的行为源于某种担忧，虽然这种担忧并不恰当，但并非出于恶意或愚蠢。况且，你我心知肚明，第一适格者并非不可替代。

"Yes sir." And yet he still fawned over the girl as if she were the only one. "Is there anything else, sir?
"是的，先生。" 尽管如此，他仍对那女孩百般讨好，好像她独一无二。"您还有别的吩咐吗，先生？

"That is all. Dismissed."
就这些了。解散。

Ritsuko nodded and picked up the folder. She took a few steps towards the door, but then hesitated, tapping an index finger against the folder.
律子点头后拿起文件夹，向门口迈了几步，却又踌躇不前，用食指轻叩着文件夹。

"Did you forget something, Doctor?"
医生，您是不是忘了什么？

She inhaled deeply. It had been quite a long time since she'd last asked him. Perhaps he had finally changed his mind.
她深吸一口气。自从上次询问他以来，已经过了很久。也许他终于改变了想法。

"My... my offer still stands, you know," she nervously said.
"我...我的提议依旧有效，你明白的，"她略显紧张地说道。

"...I... appreciate the offer, but my answer is still no."
...我...感谢你的提议，不过我还是得说，我的答案是拒绝。

Even with the distance separating them, Ritsuko could hear the slightest of changes in his tone of voice. For a second, he'd stopped being the Supreme Commander of NERV.
即便相隔甚远，律子依然能捕捉到他语调中的微妙变化。那一刻，他仿佛不再是 NERV 的最高统帅。

"I... I see," she said, unable to disguise her disappointment. "But... if you ever change your mind..." She left the rest unsaid as her nerve broke, and the head of Project E practically ran from the room like a shy schoolgirl.
"我...我明白了，"她语气中难掩失望。"不过...要是你哪天改变主意了..."话未说完，她已勇气尽失，项目 E 的负责人如同羞涩的少女般匆匆离开了房间。

The door clicked quietly shut behind Ritsuko, and she leaned her forehead on it and sighed heavily.
门在 Ritsuko 身后悄然关闭，她将额头抵在门上，深深地叹了口气。

"Is everything alright, Doctor?"
医生，一切都还好吗？

Ritsuko gave the door a weak smile as she recognised that voice behind her. Of course it was Maya. Dear, trustworthy, dependable Maya. Her only real companion besides Misato in this godawful place.
律子对着门勉强一笑，她听出了背后的声音，自然是摩耶。那位亲爱、可靠、值得信赖的摩耶。在这个糟糕之地，除了美里，她唯一的真正伴侣。

Brought back to reality, the scientist stood up straight and turned to her protégé. "I'm fine, Maya. Let's get going, I have a present for Misato and we still need to make sure the MAGI don't drop a byte after the day we've had."
回到现实，科学家挺直腰杆，转向她的学生说：“我没事，玛雅。我们出发吧，我给美里准备了礼物，还得确认 MAGI 系统在我们经历的这一天之后不会丢失任何数据。”

XXX

Gendo stared at the reflection of his office door as it shut, breathing a quiet sign of relief. He had been expecting Ritsuko to try and press the issue yet again, but it finally seemed like she was starting to get the message. Once had been enough to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was only one woman for him. Even now, a decade after her death, his love for Yui burned hot in his chest.
源渡凝视着办公室门关上的倒影，轻声松了口气。他原以为律子会再次纠缠不休，但看来她终于开始领会了。一次便足以证明，他心中唯有一位女性。即便十年过去，她已离世，他对唯的爱依旧在胸中炽热燃烧。

The soon to be officially promoted Major Katsuragi and the pilots had already left the artificial surface of the Geofront, leaving the crew tasked with loading the entry plugs onto trucks. Gendo took a last lingering glance at the shimmering lake before turning around. He took one step towards his chair, and then halted. He had spun the chair around as he had gotten up, yet it was now pointed back at the desk. He cleared his throat.
即将晋升为少校的葛城美里与驾驶员们已离开 Geofront 的人造地表，留下工作人员负责将插入栓装载至卡车上。源渡最后深情地凝视了一眼湖面上的波光，随后转身。他向自己的椅子迈出一步，却突然停下。他起身时分明将椅子转向了另一边，此刻它却再次面朝桌子。他清了清喉咙。

"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"
是什么风把您吹来了？

"Oh, you're no fun!" 哎，你真没劲！

The chair swivelled around, revealing a woman in a business suit with hair of fire.
椅子转了过来，一位身着商务套装、头发火红的女人映入眼帘。

"I'm so sorry to disappoint you, Bwynvienne," Gendo deadpanned.
"Bwynvienne，我真的很抱歉让你失望了，" Gendo 面无表情地说道。

She gave him a cheeky grin. "Now why don't I believe that?" Leaping out of his chair, Bwynvienne sauntered over to the window, mimicking his previous posture. "It's a slow day at work, I'm on break, and I just wanted to drop in and see how things were going on this plane. Especially since both you and your son are my clients, so to speak. Speaking of which... any changes yet?"
她俏皮地冲他一笑：“我怎么觉得这话不可信呢？”布温维恩从椅子上跃起，悠然踱至窗前，模仿起他先前的姿态。“今天工作清闲，我正休息，便顺道来看看这边的情况。毕竟你和你儿子都算是我的客户。对了……有什么新进展吗？”

Gendo shook his head. "No. The chill is still slowly creeping over me." Only the memory of Yui kept him warm enough to sleep at night.
源渡摇了摇头。“不，寒意依旧在慢慢侵袭我。”唯有对唯的回忆，让他能在夜间的寒意中安然入睡。

"Troubling," Bwynvienne replied, turning to face him with a frown. "You are the first in recorded history, mortal or Infernal, to have had a soul ripped away from you."
真是令人不安，" Bwynvienne 回答着，转过身来，眉头紧锁。"你是史册上第一个，无论是凡人还是地狱的生灵，灵魂被生生剥离的。

Gendo grit his teeth, recalling the horrific pain he had felt at the moment of Yui's death. It had been as if somebody had snapped his rib cage open and scooped its contents out with a white-hot shovel. And now he could feel the tentative fingers of the reaper grasping for him.
源渡紧咬牙关，回想起唯离世时那撕心裂肺的痛楚。那一刻，仿佛有人强行撬开他的胸骨，用滚烫的铁锹挖空了他的内脏。如今，他已能感受到死神那试探性的触碰正悄然逼近。

All because Yui, bless her, hah, soul, found an amusing piece of paper and convinced him to play along. He never could say no to her. The sole concession was that, due to the loss of her soul in such a violent way, the existence of another plane of reality had been revealed to him, what with Bwynvienne having had to make an appearance in a vain attempt to sort out an apparent breach of contract.
这一切都源于 Yui，愿她安息，哈哈，她的灵魂找到了一张有趣的纸条，并说服他一同参与。他总是无法拒绝她。唯一的妥协是，由于她的灵魂以如此激烈的方式消逝，另一个现实层面的存在向他揭露，因此 Bwynvienne 不得不现身，试图解决一个明显的违约问题，但徒劳无功。

He refocused his gaze on the representative of the Infernal Administration. "Is that all you came here for?" he asked.
他再次将目光投向地狱管理局的代表，问道：“你来此就为此事吗？”

Bwynvienne shrugged with one shoulder. "Mostly just checking up on you, making sure you haven't gone mad or something. I'll also be having a quick incognito look at your son just to make sure a mortal completely lacking a soul hasn't resulted in anything anomalous."
布温维耶单肩一耸，道：“主要是来探望你，确认你没出什么岔子。我还会暗中观察一下你的儿子，确保一个完全缺失灵魂的凡人没有引发任何异常。”

"Would he not be feeling the same effects as me?" Gendo wondered. "After all, we are both soulless."
他难道不会和我一样感受到这些影响吗？" 源堂暗自思忖。"说到底，我们都是无魂之人。

Fire sprayed around the room as Bwynvienne shook her head. "Shinji's soul was removed cleanly, seeing as it was a trade, but you are not quite soulless. There are still some tattered scraps left, but they're... bleeding, so to speak."
火焰在屋内四散喷溅，Bwynvienne 摇头道：“既然是交易，Shinji 的灵魂被彻底取走了，但你并非全无灵魂。还剩下一些破碎的残片，只是它们……可以说是在逐渐消散。”

Gendo refrained from putting a hand on his chest. "I see. Well, as far as I am aware, the only noticeable effects are his inability to project an AT-Field and being unable to taste anything not prepared by the owner of his soul."
源渡没有将手放在胸前，说道：“我明白了。据我所知，他目前最明显的两个问题是无法展开 AT 力场，以及无法品尝非其灵魂所有者准备的食物。”

"I can't comment on the AT-Field, but the loss of taste is normal. It's a sort of devotion thing; only your soul-bonder is able to fully satisfy your cravings, in a manner of speaking."
关于 AT 力场我无法置评，但味觉丧失是正常现象。这近乎一种奉献精神；唯有你的灵魂伴侣，才能真正满足你的渴望，这么说吧。

Well. That certainly explained things between himself and Ritsuko.
嗯，这确实阐明了他与 Ritsuko 之间的纠葛。

Bwynvienne glanced at her wrist, There was no watch there, but Gendo speculated she did the gesture simply for his benefit. "Well my break will be over soon. I'd better go check on your son."
布温维耶恩瞥向手腕，虽未佩戴手表，但根户猜想她此举仅是为了让他注意到。“我的休息时间快结束了，得去看看你儿子了。”

"One moment," Gendo quickly said, before she could vanish into thin air. "If... if I were to reunite with Yui, would that... repair the tatters?"
稍等，"源渡急忙开口，在她消失前。"如果...我与唯重逢，是否能...弥合那些裂痕？

Bwynvienne gave him an uncertain look. "You're the first to experience such a loss. I can't be sure one way or the other. All I can say is... there's nothing to definitively say it won't."
布温维耶恩带着几分犹豫地看了他一眼。“你是第一个遭遇这种损失的人。我无法断言。只能说……目前没有确凿的证据表明它不会发生。”

The woman disappeared with no fanfare or farewell, leaving Gendo alone. He stared at the spot where she had been for a long time, before slowly trudging over to his desk where he dropped down heavily in the seat, his arms hanging by its sides. After a minute he gathered his strength, bringing his hands up to his mouth and placing his elbows on the desk as he composed himself.
那位女士悄然离去，未留下任何告别的热闹，独留源堂一人。他长时间凝视着她曾站立之处，随后步履沉重地走向书桌，颓然坐下，双臂无力地垂在身旁。片刻后，他振作起来，双手捂嘴，手肘支在桌上，努力平复情绪。

"In the end, it will matter not whether I will be healed," he said to the empty room. "I will still do everything in my power to return to your side, Yui."
说到底，我能否康复已无关紧要，"他对着空无一人的房间说道。"我仍会倾尽全力回到你身边，Yui。

### Chapter 28 Let's Try This!

Shinji looked across the table at Asuka, who seemed barely cognisant of his presence, as he ate his breakfast. Bleary-eyed, she lifted the steaming cup and took a sip, wincing in distaste before letting the hand holding it almost flop back onto the table. The liquid sloshed around, threatening to escape its container and scald its drinker's hand.
真嗣吃着早餐，目光越过桌子投向明日香，她似乎对他的存在浑然不觉。她睡眼朦胧地端起热腾腾的杯子，轻啜一口后皱起眉头，显得颇为不悦，随后手几乎无力地让杯子垂落回桌面。杯中液体晃动，险些溢出烫到她的手。

He probably didn't look much better, Shinji idly speculated. Yet another sudden and synchronised wake-up had led to yet another night-time kitchen meeting between the two of them. It was entirely likely that the disastrous test was to blame for this latest occurrence; it seemed to happen most whenever something happened involving the two of them dual-synchronising.
他大概也没好到哪儿去，真嗣漫不经心地想着。又一次突如其来的同步醒来，让他们俩再次在夜深人静的厨房相遇。这次的情况，多半又是那次失败的测试所致；每当他们进行双重同步时，这种事似乎就特别容易发生。

Practically the instant Shinji finished his last mouthful of breakfast, Asuka finally spoke.
碇真嗣刚咽下最后一口早餐，明日香便开口了。

"I've tried as hard as I can to make do, but I just can't take it anymore," she said, slurring her words a little. "If I drink one more cup of instant I'm going to puke. So if these interruptions to my beauty sleep keep happening..." She trailed off as Shinji smiled, remembering the last time that particular term had come up and the hell he'd gone through. "Oi. I don't want to hear it. If these interruptions keep happening, then I need some real coffee."
我已经尽力去将就了，但实在是受不了了，"她说话时有些含糊。"再喝一杯速溶咖啡，我肯定会吐。所以，如果我的美容觉继续被打扰……"她的话音渐弱，而真嗣则微笑着，回忆起上次提及这个话题时的痛苦经历。"喂，别说了。如果这种打扰不停止，我得喝点真正的咖啡才行。

The smile dropped from Shinji's face as he blinked in puzzlement. "Real coffee?" He glanced at Asuka's cup. "Is that stuff not real?"
笑容从真嗣脸上消失，他困惑地眨眼问道：“你是说这是真咖啡？”他瞥向明日香的杯子，“难道那不是真的咖啡？”

Asuka gave him a stare so old it belonged in a museum. "Have you ever had coffee, Shinji?" she asked.
明日香投去一个古老得仿佛来自博物馆的目光。“真嗣，你喝过咖啡吗？”她问道。

"No," he admitted. "Well... I had some not long after coming to Tokyo-3 but... you know." With his inability to taste anything besides what Asuka made, the only noticeable thing he'd gotten from that cup was a need to go to the bathroom not long afterwards.
"不，" 他承认说，"嗯... 刚来东京-3 那会儿确实喝过一点，但... 你也知道。因为除了明日香做的，其他味道他都尝不出来，那杯东西唯一让他有印象的就是不久后就得跑厕所。

"Yeah, bit pointless then." Asuka raised her cup. "Anyway, this only wakes me up because it's so nasty my body's desperate to get me to stop drinking it."
确实，那挺没意义的。" 明日香举起杯子，"话说回来，这玩意儿之所以能提神，是因为它太难喝了，我的身体本能地想让我别再喝了。

"Why drink it at all then?" The only reason he still got coffee during grocery trips was because Asuka was drinking it. But now she was saying that she hated it?
既然如此，为何还要喝咖啡呢？他之前在购物时买咖啡，全因明日香喜欢。可如今她却声称讨厌咖啡？

"Because until today it's been this or nothing." She slid the cup across the table. "Not sure how your tastelessness works with beverages, but here. Drink up and... hopefully remember what it tastes like."
因为直到今天，要么这样，要么一无所有。"她将杯子推到桌对面，"不知道你对饮料的味觉如何，但请喝吧，希望能唤起你的味觉记忆。

Shinji took the cup. The coffee was still hot; it burned as it went down, but he had no desire to try and savour the drink despite being able to actually taste it. He set the cup down after only a couple of sips and shuddered; he decided he was not a coffee person.
真嗣拿起杯子，咖啡还很烫，喝下去时烫到了，但他并不想细细品味，尽管他能尝到咖啡的味道。他只啜了几口便放下杯子，不禁打了个寒颤；他觉得自己并不适合喝咖啡。

"Well I guess that answers that," Asuka remarked, taking the unwanted coffee over to the sink and tipping it out. "After school, we're finally going to get something much, much better."
看来这个问题已经有答案了，" 明日香说着，将那杯不喜欢的咖啡倒进了水槽。"放学后，我们总算能享受到更好的东西了。

XXX

The door to their apartment opened and Shinji walked through, carefully pushing off his shoes with his toes while trying not to drop the large box in his arms. Asuka was right behind him, carrying a smaller box and a bag. He manoeuvred his way into the kitchen and set his box down on the kitchen table, relieved to finally be rid of the awkward weight of the coffee machine. Asuka set down her box, containing a grinder, and the bag of coffee beans before gently shoving Shinji out of the way. He took no offence to this; he understood that she wanted to, in a sense, unwrap her present.
他们公寓的门一开，真嗣便走了进来，一边用脚尖小心地脱鞋，一边努力稳住怀中抱着的大箱子。明日香跟在他后面，手里拿着一个小箱子和一袋咖啡豆。他费劲地挪到厨房，将箱子搁在餐桌上，终于卸下了咖啡机那沉甸甸的负担。明日香放下装有磨豆机的箱子和咖啡豆袋子，然后轻轻地把真嗣挤到一边。他对此并不介意；他知道她想要亲手拆开这份礼物。

'Present' being a surprisingly suitable word, as Asuka practically tore the box open to get at the coffee machine inside. A piece of Styrofoam actually came loose and bounced off Shinji's head to his bemusement. But then Asuka turned gentle, reaching into the box and lifting the coffee machine out like it was a newborn child.
'礼物'这个词用得恰到好处，因为明日香几乎是撕开了包装盒，急切地想要拿到里面的咖啡机。一块泡沫塑料甚至脱落，弹到了真嗣的头上，让他不禁失笑。但随后明日香变得温柔，小心翼翼地从盒中取出咖啡机，仿佛捧着新生婴儿一般。

"Aaah..." she breathed, stepping over to the kitchen bench where she almost reverentially placed the machine down. "This is going to make mornings so much more tolerable."
啊……" 她轻声叹息，走向厨房台面，几乎是虔诚地将机器放下。"有了它，早晨会变得好过多了。

Shinji quirked an eyebrow at her back. "If 'real' coffee is so good, why haven't you gone out and bought a coffee machine already?"
真嗣对着她的背影挑了挑眉。"既然真正的咖啡这么好，你怎么还没去买台咖啡机呢？"

Asuka glanced over her shoulder at him. "I suppose part of it was laziness, and trying to adjust to instant coffee. Which obviously failed." She reached behind the machine, plugged it into the wall, and flipped the switch. The machine gave a soft beep as it started up. "Not to mention I'm not sure if you'd be able to enjoy the drinks coffee machines could make, and it didn't feel right to get something like this just for myself."
明日香回头瞥了他一眼，说：“一部分原因可能是懒，想试试速溶咖啡，结果显然不行。”她伸手到咖啡机后，插上电源，按下开关。机器启动时发出一声柔和的提示音。“再说，我也不确定你是否喜欢咖啡机做的饮料，总觉得只为自己买这个不太合适。”

"Asuka..." Shinji sighed and shook his head. "You'll be the one getting the most use out of it anyway. I was able to taste that coffee before because you made it, and I'm still trying to work out how that works, but I doubt that...whatever-it-is will work with a coffee machine. Even if it does, the weather lately hasn't exactly been hot drink friendly."
Asuka..." 真嗣叹息着，摇了摇头。"说到底，这咖啡机你用得最多。之前我能尝到那咖啡，全因是你亲手调制，至于这其中的奥妙，我还在摸索。但估计...那神奇的效果咖啡机是实现不了的。况且，最近这天气，也不太适合喝热饮。

"Yeah, you're probably right there." Asuka replied with a shrug. She immediately brightened up. "Oh well. The die is cast, the machine is purchased."
嗯，你说的可能没错。" 明日香耸肩回应，随即精神一振，"算了，事已至此，机器也买了。

Shinji opened up the box containing the grinder, bringing it over to sit besides the machine. "Well at the very least I could learn how to use this stuff, right?"
真嗣打开装有研磨机的盒子，将其搬到机器旁坐下。"至少我能学会怎么用这些工具，不是吗？"

"Oh?" Asuka turned an inquisitive look upon him. "Despite not enjoying coffee, you're still interested in learning how to make it properly?"
哦？" 明日香好奇地望向他，"你明明不喜欢咖啡，却还想学怎么做好它？

With a glance at the two machines, Shinji shrugged. "I may as well, there's no reason not to learn."
真嗣瞥了瞥两台机器，耸耸肩说：“我还是学学吧，反正也没什么不学的理由。”

"Well then pay attention!" A hint of Asuka the Squad Leader crept into her voice. "I'm going to show you how to make real coffee!"
那好，仔细听着！"她的语气中透露出队长明日香的一丝威严。"我来教你如何泡制地道的咖啡！

Several slightly confusing minutes later, a steaming cup of coffee was sitting on the kitchen table. Asuka leaned over it and inhaled deeply.
几分钟后，一杯热气腾腾的咖啡摆在了厨房桌上。Asuka 俯身深深吸了一口气。

"Oh damn, I'd almost forgotten this heavenly aroma," she sighed rapturously.
"哎呀，我差点忘了这令人陶醉的香气，"她满怀喜悦地叹了口气。

Even Shinji had to admit that this coffee smelled much nicer than the one he'd suffered through that morning. "What are you waiting for?" he asked, pointing at the coffee. "Are you just going to let it get cold now?"
就连真嗣也得承认，这杯咖啡的香味比他早上硬着头皮喝的那杯好多了。“你还愣着干嘛？”他指着咖啡说，“难道要眼睁睁看着它变凉吗？”

"Quiet you, I want to savour this!" Asuka snapped, hitting him with a mock glare before closing her eyes and taking another long sniff. "Aaahhh yessss..." She picked up the cup, blowing gently on the liquid, before raising it the rest of the way to her lips.
"别吵，我要细细品味！" 明日香厉声打断他，佯装瞪了他一眼，随即闭上双眼，深深吸了一口气。"啊，真是太美妙了……" 她端起杯子，轻吹散热气，然后缓缓送到唇边。

A sudden buzz from their apartment's doorbell ruined the mood. This time, Asuka's irritation was real as she glared through walls and the door at the offending person.
公寓门铃突兀地响起，搅乱了原本的氛围。这一次，明日香是真的恼火了，她隔着墙和门，怒目瞪视着那个不请自来的人。

Shinji stepped around the table, heading for the front door. "Drink up, Asuka, I'll deal with this."
真嗣绕过桌子走向前门，说道：“明日香，你先喝，这事我来解决。”

'This' turned out to be Rei Ayanami, still in her school uniform.
原来'这'是绫波丽，她还穿着校服。

"Oh, uh, hello Rei." 哦，你好，零。

"Good afternoon, Shinji," Rei replied with a nod. "Is everything well with you and Asuka? You ran off from school rather quickly when we were let out."
下午好，真嗣，" 绫波丽点头回应，"你和明日香都还好吧？放学时你匆匆忙忙就走了。

"Yes, Asuka just wanted to buy a coffee machine since-"
没错，明日香只是想购置一台咖啡机，原因是-

"Don't just stand there at the door, dummy!" Asuka's voice rang out. "Let her in!"
"别傻站在门口了，快让她进来！" 明日香的声音催促道。

"Oh. Right. Sorry Rei, come on in." Shinji sheepishly rubbed the back of his head and stepped aside.
"哦，对。不好意思，丽，进来吧。" 真嗣尴尬地挠着后脑勺，让出了路。

Upon returning to the kitchen, Shinji noted that Asuka was practically melting into her chair. "As I was saying," he said to Rei. "Asuka got sick of instant coffee and decided to get a coffee machine."
回到厨房，真嗣发现明日香瘫坐在椅子上，几乎要融进去。“我刚说到，”他转向零继续道，“明日香对速溶咖啡腻味了，决定购置一台咖啡机。”

"...The caffeine appears to be having the opposite effect to its intended purpose, however," Rei noted.
"...然而，咖啡因的效果似乎与预期相反，" Rei 指出。

Asuka hurriedly sat up straight in her seat. "Oh I'm fine," she said with a dismissive wave of a hand. "I'm just really enjoying this." She held up her cup and grinned at it, then took a long swig and set it down on the table. "You wanna try some, Wondergirl?"
明日香急忙挺直腰板，说道：“哦，我挺好的。”她摆了摆手，“我只是真的很享受此刻。”她举起杯子，对着它露出笑容，然后大口喝了一口，放在桌上。“你想尝尝吗，神奇女孩？”

"No thank you," replied Rei with a shake of her head. "I do not enjoy coffee."
不用了，谢谢，" Rei 摇头说道，"我不太喜欢喝咖啡。

"You too, huh? Shame, this is a damn fine brew."
你也这样啊？太遗憾了，这咖啡真的很棒。

"Besides, we must head to the Geofront soon for a sync test."
另外，我们得尽快去地下都市做同步测试。

"Wait what?" Asuka pulled her phone out of her pocket and looked at it. Shinji did the same to see that there was an unread message. "Oh, they sent us a text. We probably just didn't hear it while we were in the mall. Man, they really sprung this one on us out of nowhere."
什么情况？" 明日香从口袋里掏出手机查看，真嗣也跟着查看，发现有一条未读信息。"哦，他们给我们发了条短信。可能在商场里时没注意到。他们真是突然就来了这么一手。

"They probably just want to make sure there's no lingering problems after what happened yesterday," Shinji suggested.
慎二推测说：“他们可能只是想确认昨天那件事之后，没有留下什么隐患。”

"Even though we and the Evas were out of the danger zone? Eh, whatever." Asuka snapped her phone closed and looked at Rei. "When do we have to leave, and is Misato home or is she still at the Geofront?"
虽然我们和 Eva 机体已经脱离了危险区域，但那又怎样呢？" 明日香啪的一声合上手机，转向绫波问道："我们何时动身？美里是在家，还是仍在 Geofront？

"At the Geofront," said Rei. "And we will need to leave shortly."
雷说：‘在 Geofront，我们不久就得出发。’

"Alright, you mind doing me a favour? Go back next door and see if Misato's got a thermos hiding in the cupboards or something. May as well let her try the product of this machine out as well."
行吧，能帮我个忙吗？回隔壁瞧瞧，看 Misato 的橱柜里有没有藏着保温杯什么的。也让她尝尝这台机器的成果。

Rei nodded and left the apartment, returning a couple minutes later with a metallic flask in each hand. "I found two slightly different ones, and brought both for you to pick from," she reported.
丽点头后离开了公寓，几分钟后带着两个金属水壶回来了。“我找到了两个略有不同的，就都带来了，供你选择，”她汇报说。

"Two?" Asuka repeated, having just rinsed her cup out in the sink. She headed over to Rei, took the proffered thermoses, and examined them both. "Awesome, they can both be sealed. Now let's see if they can fit under the machine."
两个吗？"明日香重复着，刚把杯子在洗碗池里冲洗干净。她走向绫波，接过递来的保温瓶，仔细检查了一番。"太棒了，都能密封。现在看看它们能不能塞进机器下面。

They did indeed fit; both of them were filled to the brim and closed up. Shinji took them both, then put his shoes back on and walked outside while Asuka locked the door behind them. A Section Two agent was waiting for them outside. He gave them a single nod and walked off to the elevator, the three pilots trailing in his wake.
两个容器确实装得满满当当，封口严实。真嗣拿起它们，穿好鞋，步出门外，而明日香紧随其后锁上门。门外，一名第二分部的特工已等候多时，他向两人微微点头，便朝电梯走去，三位驾驶员紧跟其后。

Once they were in the black sedan, Shinji offered one of the thermoses to Asuka, but was somewhat surprised when she shook her head.
坐进黑色轿车后，真嗣递给明日香一个保温瓶，却略感意外地看到她摇头拒绝。

"Second one's not for me," she said. "Misato didn't come home with us, and I'll bet the good doctor hasn't slept since the attack. I figure both of them could use a proper pick-me-up, and I'd rather have someone coherent overseeing our tests."
第二个我就不用了，"她表示。"Misato 没跟我们回来，我猜那位医生自袭击后就没合过眼。他们俩肯定需要提提神，我还是希望有个清醒的人来监督测试。

XXX

As Asuka had expected, the heads of Project E and Tactical Operations looked just about dead when the teenagers finally reached the office they were currently working in. They were both slumped in their chairs; Doctor Akagi was angrily smoking a cigarette while staring at her computer while Misato was lifting a plastic cup of coffee to her lips. Kensuke was already there, and he gave them a wave as they walked in.
正如明日香预料的那样，当少年们抵达他们正在工作的办公室时，项目 E 和战术行动的负责人显得疲惫不堪。两人都无力地靠在椅子上；赤木博士一边愤怒地抽着烟，一边盯着电脑屏幕，而美里则举起塑料杯，小口喝着咖啡。健介已经先到了，他们进门时他向他们挥手致意。

Asuka promptly marched over to their guardian and knocked the cup out of her hands. Brown liquid splashed over the back wall of the office. Misato opened her mouth to protest, but a thermos shoved into her face forestalled any argument. Doctor Akagi simply stared tiredly at the other thermos that was being offered to her for a few seconds, before wearily raising a hand to take it.
明日香迅速走到监护人身边，一把打掉了她手中的杯子。棕色的液体溅满了办公室的后墙。美里正要抗议，一个保温杯突然塞到她面前，打断了她的话。赤木博士疲惫地凝视着递过来的另一个保温杯，片刻后，才无力地伸手接过。

"What's this?" Misato asked, twisting the cap of the thermos to open it up. "More coffee?"
这是什么？" 三乡边问边拧开保温杯的盖子。"还是咖啡吗？

"I've had enough of whatever's making Shinji and I wake up in the middle of the night," Asuka explained. "I went out and bought the best coffee maker I could find so I didn't have to deal with still being tired in the morning."
我和真嗣半夜总被什么东西吵醒，我已经受够了，"明日香解释说。"为此，我特意买了市面上最好的咖啡机，确保早上不再疲惫。

"You won't accept sleeping pills but you're just fine with stimulants?" Ritsuko asked with a quirked eyebrow.
"你拒绝服用安眠药，却对兴奋剂毫不介意？" 律子挑起一边眉毛问道。

"There's a difference and you know it," Asuka retorted.
"你心里清楚，确实有差别，" 明日香反驳说。

Misato sniffed at the opening of her thermos, and then shrugged. "Well, whatever. Coffee's coffee."
真嗣闻了闻保温杯的开口，随后耸耸肩。“算了，咖啡嘛，都一个味儿。”

"Wait a second," Kensuke said, holding up a hand just as Misato was about to drink. He then pointed at her, or rather at her shoulder. "Am I seeing things, or did you get a promotion?"
稍等，" 健介说着，举手阻止了即将喝水的真嗣。他指向她，准确地说是指向她的肩章，问道："是我看错了吗，你是不是晋升了？

Again denied a draught of her precious elixir, Misato stifled a sigh. "Yes, Aida. After yesterday's events, the Commander apparently decided I should get a promotion." She glanced at Ritsuko, who both shook her head and waved a hand in a negative response.
再次被拒绝饮用那珍贵的灵药，葛城美里强忍住叹息。“没错，相田。看来指挥官因为昨天的事决定提拔我了。”她瞥向律子，后者摇头摆手，表示否定。

Whatever unspoken communication went on between the two adults made no sense to Shinji. He and Asuka moved closer to Misato to examine the new insignia; instead of the three stars and one bar, now it was a single star and two linked bars.
两位成年人之间的无声交流，对真嗣而言毫无头绪。他和明日香凑近美里，细看新徽章：原本的三颗星和一条杠，现已变为一颗星与两条相连的杠。

Asuka reached out and tapped Misato's shoulder over the bars. "You do realise we're going to have to celebrate this, right?"
明日香伸手越过栏杆，轻拍了一下美里的肩膀，“你肯定记得我们得庆祝一下吧？”

"I suppose," Misato replied, with a surprising lack of enthusiasm. "But let's talk about that later." The missing enthusiasm returned as she raised her thermos in a salute. "Let's try this!"
我想，" 碇真嗣回答时，热情出奇地不足。"这事我们晚点再聊。" 她举起保温杯示意，那份热情又回来了。"来尝尝这个！

One minute later... 一分钟之后...

"Rits I don't care how much it costs I want that crappy machine in the cafeteria replaced with whatever it is Asuka bought this stuff is incredible holy shit just put one in every office!" Misato happily exclaimed without a pause for breath. Her sudden hyperactive state reminded Shinji of when she had almost overdosed on caffeine right before Asuka arrived in Japan.
"Rits，费用多少我不在乎，赶紧把食堂那台破机器换成 Asuka 买的那种，这东西太神奇了，天啊，每个办公室都得配一台！" Misato 一口气不停地说着，兴奋异常。她这突如其来的亢奋让 Shinji 想起了她差点因为咖啡因过量而昏倒，那是在 Asuka 来日本之前的事。

Ritsuko leaned away from Misato. "...Right... I'll... um... look into that," she mumbled, her eyes darting from the thermos still held to her lips to the person who had given her this volatile chemical. She gently set the thermos down on the table and nudged it away with the tips of her fingers. "Anyway... once Misato's come down off her high, thank you very much, we'll be starting with some standard harmonics tests and then proceeding with some simulation training."
律子稍稍远离了美里，"...好的...我...嗯...会去查一查，"她支吾着，眼神从紧贴唇边的保温杯转向了递给她这种易挥发化学品的人。她轻手轻脚地将保温杯置于桌上，又用指尖将其稍稍推远。"那么...等美里从兴奋中平静下来，非常感谢，我们就要开始进行一些常规的谐波测试，接着进行模拟训练。"

XXX

Thankfully Misato managed to get her coffee buzz under control by the time the pilots were ready to start the simulation training. After a bit of discussion, Shinji decided that he wanted to get in some solo piloting time. He didn't know yet if the results from yesterday's aborted tests had been implemented yet, and didn't want to take any chances.
幸好，美里在飞行员们准备开始模拟训练前，成功平复了因咖啡引起的兴奋。经过一番讨论，真嗣决定要进行一些单独的飞行练习。他还不清楚昨天中断的测试结果是否已被采纳，因此不愿冒险。

First came some sparring between the pilots; Asuka predictably did the best out of all of them, only losing in the final free-for-all round when Shinji and Kensuke declared a truce and ganged up on her. Even then she was able to hold off both the traitorous boys until, surprisingly, Rei also joined in by sneaking up behind Unit-02 and suplexing the red mech into a building.
起初，飞行员们之间展开了较量；明日香一如既往地表现出色，仅在最后的自由混战中失利，当时真嗣和健介宣布休战并联手对付她。尽管如此，她仍能抵挡住这两个背叛的男孩，直到令人意外的是，绫波也加入战斗，悄悄从背后接近零号机，将红色机甲摔进一座建筑。

What was more surprising was that Asuka, rather than getting mad at Rei, actually congratulated the bluenette on getting the drop on her as Unit-02 got back to its feet. Then, without any warning, Asuka headbutted Unit-00 directly in its eye. Reeling from the sudden attack, Rei was helpless as Unit-02 lifted its opponent vertically; Unit-00 was held upside down for several seconds before getting slammed back down to earth.
令人意外的是，明日香并未对绫波发怒，反而赞许了这位蓝发少女的先发制人，因为此时二号机已重新站起。紧接着，毫无预警地，明日香操控的二号机猛地用头部撞击零号机的眼部。遭受突袭的绫波措手不及，二号机将零号机垂直举起，倒挂数秒后，再将其重重摔落地面。

"Well I guess they're enjoying the training," Misato remarked as Asuka crowed while flexing Unit-02's arms.
"看来他们挺享受这次训练的，" 碇真嗣评论道，而明日香正兴奋地操控着二号机伸展双臂。

However, the redhead had apparently forgotten about the other two pilots, as the purple and yellow Evangelions proceeded to clothesline her.
然而，那位红发驾驶员似乎忘了还有另外两名飞行员，紫黄两色的福音战士随即对她发起了横扫攻击。

"As fun as this clearly is for them, we've got other stuff to do," said Ritsuko. She had relented and gone back to the thermos of coffee Asuka had given her, and while she had not turned hyperactive like Misato had, she was definitely feeling the effects. Perhaps she should see about getting the machine in the cafeteria replaced...
"虽然这对他们来说显然很有趣，但我们还有其他事情要忙，"丽萨子说道。她已经妥协，重新拿起明日香给她的咖啡保温瓶，虽然没有像美里那样变得异常活跃，但她确实感受到了咖啡的提神效果。或许她应该考虑更换食堂里的咖啡机了...

Unit-02 kipped up, immediately ducking under a punch from Unit-04 before giving a couple rib-rattling punches to its chest in return.
单元-02 敏捷地跃起，瞬间低头避开了单元-04 的攻击，紧接着向其胸部猛击几拳，力度之大足以震颤肋骨。

"Let's give them another ten minutes or so." Misato waved a hand at the screen. "They can't cut loose like this normally, and if anything I think it's bringing them closer together. They're certainly working as a team... sort of," she added as Unit-01 kicked at Unit-02, only to miss as Asuka stepped aside and let the foot pass by to connect with Unit-00. Rei immediately changed teams.
"我们再等他们十分钟吧。" 美里对着屏幕挥了挥手，"他们平时难得有机会这样放松，我觉得这反而增进了他们的团结。他们确实在协作...虽然有点乱，"她补充说，因为初号机试图踢二号机，但明日香及时闪避，导致这一脚误中了零号机。丽随即转换了立场。

"Fine. Ten more minutes," said Ritsuko with a resigned sigh. "We are just doing this as part of a diagnostic anyway."
好吧。再等十分钟，" Ritsuko 带着一丝无奈地说，"我们这么做只是为了诊断而已。

"Haven't found anything, have you?"
还没发现什么，是吧？

"Thankfully not. Another day or so and, apart from the Pribnow Box, it'll be like nothing ever happened."
幸好没有。再过一天左右，除了普里布诺框外，其他一切都将恢复如初，仿佛未曾发生过任何事。

"Good, we should be able to attend Yuki's wedding next week after all."
太好了，看来我们还是能去参加下周由纪的婚礼。

Ritsuko could hear the grin on Misato's face. "You just want an excuse to get socially shitfaced again. Was the beer hall not enough? Oh wait." She tapped a finger on her chin. "It's an excuse to go out with Kaji again instead, isn't it?"
律子能听出美里脸上得意的笑容。“你不过是想找个理由再次喝个痛快。啤酒馆还不够尽兴吗？哦，等等。”她用手指轻点着下巴。“其实是为了再次和加持出去的借口吧？”

Misato proceeded to descend into school-girl like spluttering, blushing and unconvincing denials.
碇真嗣接着表现出女学生般的慌乱，满脸通红，连连否认，却难以让人信服。

"Alright Mister Aida," said Misato, levelling a stern look at the boy's comm window. "Since you've been so critical of how NERV handled its first Angel attack, let's see you do better."
好吧，艾达先生，" 碇真嗣严肃地盯着男孩的通讯窗口说，"既然你对 NERV 应对首个使徒的策略颇有微词，那就让我们见识一下你的高招。

"Wait, what?" 等一下，你说什么？

"We're sticking you in the same situation as what Shinji went through," she explained. "Of course, we can't remove your piloting experience, so we'll have to make do."
我们让你经历与真嗣相同的处境，"她解释说。"虽然无法抹去你的驾驶经验，但也只能这样了。

In the simulation, the launch catapult slammed to a halt on the surface; the locks disengaged and freed Unit-04 from the confines of the cradle. The simulacrum of Sachiel, the Third Angel, turned to stare at the newcomer.
模拟场景中，发射弹射器突然在地面停下，锁定机构随即解锁，使 04 号单位得以脱离支架的限制。模拟出的第三使徒萨基尔转过身，目光投向了新出现的单位。

Kensuke stared back for a second, then interlaced his fingers and stretched his arms out to crack his knuckles. "...Fine, let's do this!" he said as he took hold of the controls.
健介回望了一瞬，接着双手十指交扣，伸直手臂，让指节咔咔作响。“...行，咱们开始吧！”他一边说着，一边握紧了操纵杆。

Unit-04 broke into a run... and promptly fell forward onto the road.
单元 04 一跑起来就...立刻向前摔倒在路面上。

"W-what the heck just happened?!" Kensuke shouted in alarm.
"W-到底发生了什么鬼事情?!" 健介惊慌地喊道。

Misato couldn't hold back a grin. "I told you we'd have to make do." She glanced sidelong at Ritsuko, who completely coincidentally had a hand over her mouth.
美里不禁露出了笑容：“我早说过，我们得将就着点。”她侧目看向律子，律子正巧用手捂着嘴。

Unit-04 climbed back to its feet, just in time for Sachiel to latch onto its face. The purple Evangelion kicked at Sachiel and reached a hand up to its shoulder pylon, which opened to reveal that it was completely empty.
单元-04 刚站稳，萨基尔就扑上来抓住了它的脸。紫色的福音战士随即一脚踢开萨基尔，并伸手探向肩部的塔架，塔架开启后，里面却是空空如也。

"Oh come on!" 哎呀，别这样！

Eventually, after Misato and Ritsuko had had some fun of their own, they allowed the Fourth Child to fight Sachiel on his own terms. This mostly involved distractions, decoys, and sneaking around until Unit-04 could get close enough to ambush the Angel and stick a knife in its core. During the engagement Kensuke also asked for, of all things, a cardboard box.
最终，在碇真嗣和葛城美里自得其乐之后，他们允许第四适格者按照自己的策略与使徒萨基尔交战。策略主要包括分散注意、设置诱饵和潜行接近，直至零号机能够伏击使徒并刺中其核心。战斗期间，洞木光还特别要求了一个纸板箱。

That request was denied. 该请求已被拒绝。

The other three pilots were busy in their own simulations: Rei was doing a training session meant to improve her somewhat lacking melee skills, while conversely Shinji and Asuka were working to improve their effectiveness at medium and long range.
另外三位飞行员正忙于各自的模拟训练：绫波专注于提升她稍显薄弱的近战技能，而真嗣和明日香则致力于增强中远距离作战的能力。

Finally, well past their normal dinner time, the teenagers were released from NERV and sent off back home. Misato dropped Kensuke off at his place, and he waved at the car's occupants as it sped away with a squeal of tyres. He ruefully shook his head at his superior officer's driving habits before heading indoors.
最终，早已过了他们通常的晚餐时间，这些青少年才从 NERV 获释，踏上了回家的路。Misato 把 Kensuke 送到家门口，他向车内的同伴挥手告别，车子在轮胎的尖锐摩擦声中迅速驶离。他苦笑着对上司的驾驶风格摇了摇头，随后走进了家门。

"Hey Ken," came a voice from the lounge room as he removed his shoes.
"嘿，Ken，" 客厅里传来一个声音，他正脱下鞋子。

"Hey Dad," Kensuke called out in response as he walked into the lounge room. His father was half-sitting on the recliner in front of the television, his NERV coveralls removed down to his waist, eating from a take-out box. "Guess training took a lot longer than I thought if you're home before me."
嘿，爸，" 健介走进客厅时喊道。他的父亲半躺在电视前的躺椅上，上身只穿着 NERV 制服的下半部分，正从外卖盒里吃着东西。"看来训练比我想象的要久，你都比我先回来了。

"Yeah, and that's even after stopping to get this." His father raised the take-out box. "I got your favourite too; it's waiting in the oven."
对，而且这还是在停下来取这个之后。"他父亲举起外卖盒说，"我还买了你最爱吃的，现在正放在烤箱里保温。

"Thanks Dad." 谢谢爸爸。

Kensuke glanced at his father before heading into the kitchen. Both the lack of decent cooking skill in the Aida household, combined with the longer hours his father was having to work lately, meant that the man was starting to develop a paunch from all the fast food intake. The only thing keeping Kensuke from the same fate was school and, nowadays, NERV. He switched the oven off and took his dinner out, then headed upstairs to his room where he sank into the comfortable chair in front of his computer and pressed the power button.
健介在步入厨房前，目光掠过父亲。相田家烹饪技艺平平，加之父亲近期工作时间延长，导致他因频繁食用快餐而日渐发福。健介得以幸免，全赖学校生活及现今在 NERV 的职责。他关闭烤箱，取出晚餐，随即上楼回房，坐于电脑前的舒适椅中，轻触电源键。

Half an hour of web-surfing later, Kensuke's phone buzzed a couple of times; the signal for a received text message. With great effort he heaved himself out of his slouched position and reached out for the phone, knocking the -thankfully empty- fast food box onto the floor. He stared at it for a second before returning his attention to his phone, flipping it open and navigating to the messaging app. He didn't recognise the number, but the content of the message made it easy to determine the sender. It also made him wonder just how the person had acquired his phone number.
半小时的网络浏览后，健介的手机嗡嗡作响，提示收到短信。他费劲地从懒散的坐姿中挺直身子，伸手去拿手机，却不慎将那空无一物的快餐盒碰落至地。他瞥了一眼地上的盒子，随即把注意力转回手机，打开屏幕，进入短信应用。虽然号码陌生，但短信内容让他轻易猜出了发信人。他不禁纳闷，对方究竟是如何弄到他的手机号的。

ART ROOM AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW CAMERA BOY.
明天放学后，艺术室见，带上相机，男孩。

XXX

Time had slowed to such a glacial pace that Shinji would instantly believe an Angel was somehow involved, if the theory was put forth. He narrowed his eyes slightly at the teacher at the front of the classroom, wondering if the old man was said Angel in disguise. He certainly had an uncanny ability to lull an entire classroom of normally highly-active students into a torpor, and considering what the previous Angels had been capable of one with hypnotic powers wasn't exactly that far-fetched.
时间仿佛凝固成冰川般的缓慢，若有人提出这是某个使徒的伎俩，真嗣定会深信不疑。他略带怀疑地眯起眼睛，打量着站在教室前方的老师，暗自揣测这位老者是否就是那个化身为人的使徒。他确实有一种非凡的本领，能让满屋子原本精力充沛的学生陷入沉睡，考虑到之前使徒们的能力，拥有催眠术的使徒也并非无稽之谈。

Bereft of anything actually interesting coming from the teacher, Shinji's attention wandered idly around the classroom. To his absolute lack of surprise, nearly the entire classroom was either asleep, about to fall asleep, or staving off the torture by focusing on something on their laptops. What was surprising was that Rei was among the latter, studiously tapping away at her keyboard and occasionally glancing out the window.
老师讲的内容索然无味，新二的注意力不由自主地在教室里游走。果不其然，教室里几乎所有人都陷入了沉睡、即将入睡，或是通过盯着笔记本电脑来逃避这种煎熬。令人意外的是，绫波也属于后者，她专注地敲击着键盘，不时向窗外瞥上一眼。

Shinji's own laptop was sitting closed on the desk in front of him; he just couldn't think of anything worth using it for. In front of him, Asuka seemed to be somewhere between the second and third options; while she was also using her laptop, her movements seemed lethargic even though she'd drunk her precious coffee that morning.
真嗣的笔记本电脑静静地合着，摆在他面前的桌上，他却想不出有什么用它的必要。而坐在他面前的明日香，似乎处于第二和第三种选择之间；虽然她也在用笔记本电脑，但动作显得有些无精打采，尽管那天早上她已经享用了她钟爱的咖啡。

That just about clinched it for Shinji, and he made a note to ask Doctor Akagi if NERV could investigate Mr. Nebukawa. Ever since getting the coffee machine, Asuka had been so energetic she had practically been bouncing off the walls. Only supernatural powers or soporifics could possibly be the cause for her current state, and Shinji was positive that... well okay, fairly sure, that the old man wasn't sneakily drugging them.
这几乎让真嗣下定了决心，他打算向赤木博士咨询，看 NERV 是否能对根来先生进行调查。自从安装了咖啡机，明日香变得异常活跃，简直像是要从墙上弹起来一样。除了超自然力量或安眠药，没有其他原因能解释她此刻的状态，而真嗣坚信...嗯，至少相当肯定，那位老人并没有暗中给他们下药。

When the bell signalling the end of the school day finally rang, Shinji could swear that the windows bowed out slightly from the collective sigh of relief. Hikari did the standard routine of "Rise! Bow!" and the classroom emptied almost completely in seconds. Only Shinji was left and, as he turned around, Kensuke was still sitting in his seat, staring at nothing.
放学铃声响起的那一刻，真嗣确信窗户都因大家集体的释然而微微鼓出。光按照惯例喊出“起立！鞠躬！”，教室转眼间几乎空无一人。只剩下真嗣，他转身一看，健介还坐在座位上，目光空洞地发呆。

A beeping sound came from Kensuke's bag, startling him out of his funk. He reached a hand in and dug around for a moment, then pulled out his mobile phone. Flipping it open, Kensuke stared at the screen for a second before sighing.
神助的包里突然传来哔哔声，把他从心事中惊醒。他伸手在包里摸索片刻，掏出了手机。翻开屏幕，神助凝视了一瞬，接着深深叹了口气。

"Something wrong, Kensuke?" Shinji asked.
"健介，有什么不对劲吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Oh, it's nothing," Kensuke replied with a wave of his hand. "Just karma finally catching up to me, that's all."
哦，没什么大不了的，" 健介摆手说道，"不过是因果循环，终于轮到我了。

"...Huh?" ...嗯？

Kensuke reached into his bag again, this time retrieving a smaller bag that he set on the table and unzipped. Upon seeing what was inside, Shinji let out an 'ah' of understanding. "That third year girl who's blackmailing you," he said.
健介再次从包中掏出一个更小的包，放在桌上并解开拉链。看到包内之物，真嗣恍然大悟地“啊”了一声。“就是那个三年级的女生在勒索你吧，”他随即说道。

"Yep." Kensuke gave a doleful nod as he slowly stood up. "Natsumi Akera. She's calling in that 'favour' now, so me and my camera need to get over to the art room to take that photo of her she wants for some reason."
没错。" 健介带着几分忧郁地点头，慢慢站起来。"赤座夏美。她现在要我偿还那个'人情'，所以我得带着相机去美术室，给她拍一张她想要的照片。

"I feel so sorry for you," Shinji deadpanned. "I'll make sure to attend your funeral."
我真为你感到难过，" 真嗣面无表情地说。"你的葬礼我一定到场。

Kensuke raised an eyebrow. "Huh. I clearly saw you open your mouth, but I distinctly heard Soryu talking then."
健介挑起一边眉毛，说道：“奇怪，我确实看到你张嘴了，可我分明听到是苏龙在说话。”

Shinji let out a short chuckle in response before leaving the luckless boy to his fate.
真嗣轻笑一声作为回应，然后任由那不幸的男孩面对自己的命运。

XXX

Kensuke sighed as he trudged along the corridor, dodging other students and keeping one hand tight on the camera hanging from its strap around his neck. Occasionally a male student would notice him, or perhaps more specifically the camera, and raise a hopeful eyebrow. He resolutely ignored them and continued on. The art room was on the first floor so he went down the staircase, each footfall seemingly heavier than the last.
健介叹息着，拖着沉重的步伐穿过走廊，一边躲避其他学生，一边用一只手紧紧抓住挂在胸前的相机带。不时地，有男生注意到他，或者更准确地说，是注意到他胸前的相机，便满怀期待地挑起眉毛。他坚定地不予理会，继续前行。美术室位于一楼，他走下楼梯，每一步都显得愈发沉重。

He didn't know what he was expecting to see when he slid open the door to the art room, but two other younger students in the room with Akera was most definitely unexpected. He stood stock still in the doorway, his free hand still on the door, blinking at the three black-haired students while they simply stared back. Just as Kensuke felt he was about to explode out of sheer awkwardness, Akera stepped forward to stand directly in front of him.
他并不清楚自己期待在推开美术室的门时会看到什么，但房间里除了明里还有另外两个更年轻的学生，这完全出乎意料。他僵硬地站在门口，一只手还搭在门上，眨着眼睛与那三个黑发学生对视，而他们也只是静静地回望着他。就在健介感到尴尬到极点，几乎要爆发时，明里走上前来，直接站在他面前。

"Took you long enough," she said.
"你可算来了，"她说。

Kensuke blinked yet again. "It's... only been a couple minutes..."
健介又眨了眨眼，说道：“才刚过去几分钟而已……”

She leaned forward. He leaned back. "A lot can happen in a couple minutes." Her voice was low; clearly she didn't want the other two students to hear. "Such as, oh... I don't know... me accidentally letting slip that a certain boy with a camera has been sticking it where it doesn't belong."
她身体前倾，而他则向后仰。“短短几分钟，能发生的事可多了。”她压低声音，显然不想让另外两个学生听见。“比如，我不小心说漏嘴，透露出某个带着相机的男生一直在不该他管的地方瞎掺和。”

With his face flushing, Kensuke retorted, "Alright alright I get your point! But you can threaten me all you want, you're only getting one!"
健介满脸通红地反驳：“行了行了，我懂你的意思！不过，你尽管威胁，也只能拿到一个！”

"And I only want one. I'm not going to get greedy, and considering how popular your little business is-"
我只要一个就好。不会贪得无厌，毕竟你的小生意如此受欢迎——

"Was," Kensuke corrected. "Horaki and Soryu shut me down a while ago."
是，" 健介纠正说。"堀越和惣流之前已经让我停手了。

"Horaki and who?" Akera glanced away for a second, her brows furrowing in thought. "Oh right, that redheaded transfer student. Well I was going to say that other people might consider getting some revenge on you one way or another, but I guess you managed to dodge that bullet."
堀崎和谁来着？" 明良目光移开片刻，眉头微皱，思索着。"哦，想起来了，那个红发的转学生。我本想说，别人可能会找机会报复你，不过看来你已经避开了这个麻烦。

"So what's happening now?" asked Kensuke, frantically trying to drag them both back onto the important topic. "And why are... those two here? Even when I was still in business I never did... guys..."
那现在到底怎么了？" 健介焦急地试图将话题拉回正轨，"还有，为什么...那两个人会在这里？即便在我经商时，我也未曾接触过...那些人...

"If you had you could have doubled your potential customer base." Akera smirked. "But if you'd taken photos of these two without permission you'd be dead in the ground instead of here talking to me. They're my little brothers."
如果你拍了他们的照片而未经允许，你现在就不会在这里和我交谈，而是躺在地下了。他们是我的弟弟们。

"...Oh." Now that he had a moment to look at the boys he could see the resemblance, as well as the fact that they were twins.
"...哦。" 此刻细看，他才发觉两男孩颇为相像，显然是双胞胎。

"Look, you're a pervert, there's no denying that," Akera went on. She pointed at his camera. "But you've clearly got talent with that thing. You managed to get a perfect picture of my best friend at the pool, right when she was about to dive in, from probably a hundred metres away without anybody noticing. I want you to turn that talent to something a lot less shady. You're going to take some professional shots of all three of us, so I can send it to our grandparents in Kyoto. They're too old to travel and haven't seen us in years."
听着，你确实有偷拍的癖好，这毋庸置疑，" 阿克拉接着说。她指向他的相机。"不过，你在这方面显然很有天赋。你居然能在我好友即将跳水时，从百米开外捕捉到她完美的瞬间，且无人察觉。我希望你能将这份才能用于正途。你得为我们三人拍一组专业照片，我要寄给在京都的祖父母。他们年事已高，不便远行，已经多年未见我们了。

"What about your parents?" asked Kensuke. "Don't you want to get them in the shot as well?"
你父母怎么办呢？" 健介问道，"难道不想让他们也入镜吗？

Akera rolled her eyes, and Kensuke noticed the suddenly disappointed looks on the boys' faces. "Our parents are always too damn busy with work. They get home late, usually after the boys have gone to bed, and they're either gone or about to leave by the time we get up." Her voice turned bitter. "I've been practically raising my brothers myself for the last few years."
阿克拉翻了个白眼，健介注意到男孩们脸上突然露出的失望表情。"我们的父母总是忙于工作，回家晚，通常我们睡了他们才回来，早上我们起床时，他们又已经走了。"她的语气带着苦涩。"这几年，我几乎是在独自抚养弟弟们。"

Kensuke sighed. "Let me take a wild guess. They work for NERV?"
健介叹息一声。“我猜猜看，他们是 NERV 的成员吧？”

All three siblings nodded. One of the boys said, "We don't even really know what they do there."
三兄妹都点头表示同意。其中一个男孩开口道：“我们其实并不太了解他们在那儿具体做什么。”

"Alright, well..." Kensuke rubbed a hand over his face in disbelief, momentarily dislodging his glasses. He adjusted them and took a look around the room. "This place isn't suitable for the quality you're asking for though."
好吧，嗯..." 健介难以置信地用手抹了把脸，眼镜一时滑落。他调整好眼镜，环顾四周后说："这个地方可满足不了你要求的高标准。

"I know," said Akera. "I spoke to the film club president. They've got some outdoor work to do today, so he's letting us borrow their room along with the lighting and backdrops. As a matter of fact..." She glanced at her watch. "According to the president, they should be leaving in a minute. So let's head over there."
我了解情况，"阿克拉说道。"我已与电影俱乐部主席沟通过。他们今天有户外活动，因此主席同意我们使用他们的房间，包括灯光和背景布。实际上……"她看了看手表。"主席说他们很快就会离开。我们赶紧过去吧。

Kensuke nodded, and opened the art room's door. The school corridors were mostly empty at this point, the students either heading home or at their after-school activities. Akera led the way down to the other end of the main corridor where the film club room was situated. One student nodded at Akera as they passed, which she returned. They soon reached a door marked with a sign saying 'Please do not disturb. Filming in progress.' Upon entering the room, Kensuke hummed in approval. The windows were covered with blackout curtains and there were a couple sets of stage lights pointed at a conveniently already set up purple backdrop.
健介点头示意，推开了美术室的门。此刻，学校走廊里人迹寥寥，学生们大多已回家或参与课外活动。明良在前引路，穿过主走廊，直至尽头，那里便是电影俱乐部的所在。途中，一名学生向明良点头致意，她亦礼貌回应。不久，他们来到一扇门前，门上贴着“拍摄中，请勿打扰”的告示。步入室内，健介不禁发出满意的哼声。窗户被厚重的遮光窗帘遮挡，几盏舞台灯正对着一块已布置妥当的紫色背景布。

"Did the film club do this for us?" asked Kensuke.
"电影俱乐部这么做是为了我们吗？" 健介问道。

"Nah, apparently they were filming some mockup advertisements or something," replied Akera. "Suits us just fine though, less work for us."
嗯，看来他们在拍些模拟广告之类的，"阿克拉回应说。"这对我们倒是好事，可以少做点工作。

The two brothers set up a couple of chairs in front of the backdrop while Kensuke adjusted the angle of the lights, grumbling about how poor they would be for this kind of work. Akera then proceeded to fuss over the boys, straightening their uniforms and tucking away errant hair.
两兄弟在背景布前摆好椅子，健介则一边调整灯光角度，一边不满地嘟囔着这些灯光对工作质量的影响。接着，明良开始细心打理，帮男孩们整理制服，将乱发一一收拢。

"Uh, don't you need a tripod?" one of the boys asked as Kensuke got into position to begin.
"哎，你不用三脚架吗？" 一个男孩疑惑地问，这时肯助已经摆好姿势，准备开拍。

"Too much effort to lug it to school, not to mention keeping it somewhere," Kensuke replied. "Besides, my hands are steady enough."
拖着它去学校太费劲了，更不用说还得找地方安置，" 健介回答说。"况且，我的手够稳当。

The shoot began, starting with the two boys sitting down while Akera stood behind them with a hand on their shoulders. The siblings went through various setups for a while until the digital camera signalled it was out of space. Kensuke's arms dropped to his sides, the camera dangling from its strap around his neck, as he let out an exhausted sigh.
拍摄开始，两个男孩坐下，赤楽站在他们后面，手搭在他们的肩上。兄妹俩尝试了多种拍摄姿势，直到数码相机提示存储空间不足。健介的双臂无力地垂下，相机挂绳绕在脖子上，他发出了一声疲惫的叹息。

"All done then?" Akera asked, to which he nodded. "Nothing left for us to do?" A shake of the head this time. "Alright, I'll leave you to it."
都处理完了吗？"阿克拉问道，对方点头示意。"我们这边没其他事了吧？"这次换成了摇头。"行，那我先走了。

As she turned to leave, Kensuke spoke up. "Wait, why did you ask me to do this?"
她刚要转身离去，健介突然开口：“等等，你为什么让我做这件事？”

Instead of answering immediately, Akera glanced at her brothers and jerked her head towards the door. The two boys left, leaving her and Kensuke alone in the room. "You're asking why I'm using my leverage to get you to do something so... normal, right?"
阿克拉并未立刻作答，而是瞥向她的兄弟们，示意他们离开。两个男孩随即离去，房间里只剩下她和健介。“你想问的是，我为何要动用我的影响力，让你去做这么一件平常至极的事，对吧？”

"Well... yeah," Kensuke rubbed the back of his head. "I mean, I thought you were going to get me to take a photo of just yourself."
嗯...确实，" 健介摸了摸后脑勺，"我本以为你只是想让我给你拍张单人照。

Akera quirked an eyebrow. "Oh?" She folded her arms and slowly walked up to him. "Are you saying you wanted to see me in something more... revealing?"
阿克拉挑眉道：“哦？”她双臂抱胸，缓缓逼近他。“你是想看我穿得更……性感一些吗？”

"Y-no! I-I mean, I wasn't hoping to see you like that," Kensuke babbled, his face reddening. "Um, not that I think you're ugly or anything but considering the photos I've taken and that you knew of my former business I thought your intention was to get me to take a photo of you like that for like a boyfriend or something and-"
哎呀，不！我的意思是，我没想到会这样见到你，" 健介语无伦次地说，脸颊泛红。"呃，不是说你不好看，只是想到我以前拍的照片，还有你知道我以前的职业，我以为你是想让我那样给你拍照，比如给男朋友之类的，然后-

"Yeah yeah, I get it," said Akera, cutting him off. As he sucked in a lungful of air, she sighed and rolled her eyes. "Look, I wanted something like this done for my family, and if I'd just asked you normally you probably would have charged me for it."
好了好了，我懂了，"阿克拉打断他，深吸一口气后，她叹了口气，翻了个白眼。"其实，我是想为家人办这事，如果我直接开口，你大概会收费吧。

"But this is just so... tame compared to what you're holding over my head," replied Kensuke.
"但这与你手中握有的我的把柄相比，实在是太过平淡无奇了。" Kensuke 回应说。

"Are you saying that I should make you do even more?"
你的意思是，我应该让你承担更多工作吗？

"Er... no, but-" 呃...不是，但是-

"I needed this done, and you were the best way for me to get it done. As far as I'm concerned, once I have those photos in my hand our deal is finished. Got it?"
我需要办成这件事，而你是我达成目的的最佳选择。对我来说，只要我手里有了那些照片，我们的交易就告一段落了。清楚了吗？

Kensuke cautiously nodded.
健介谨慎地点了点头。

"Good." Akera whirled around and started heading for the door. "I'll see you in the library tomorrow at lunch. Bring your suggestions for the best photos and we'll go through them then."
好的。"阿克拉旋即转身，朝门口走去。"明天午饭时图书馆见。记得带上你挑出的最佳照片建议，届时我们一同审阅。

"Hold on!" exclaimed Kensuke, flinching slightly as Akera groaned in frustration and turned back around. "...Sorry. You want me to sift through these photos for you?"
等等！"健介惊呼一声，身体微颤，只见明良懊恼地呻吟着，又转过身去。"...不好意思。需要我帮你整理这些照片吗？

Akera shrugged. "You're perfectly capable of that, aren't you? Like I said before, you've got talent. I trust you enough to pick them for us."
阿克拉耸耸肩。“你完全能胜任，不是吗？正如我之前所说，你很有才华。我信任你，可以为我们挑选。”

With that said she left the room, leaving a puzzled camera boy behind.
言毕，她便离开了房间，留下一脸茫然的摄像小哥。

"And... yeah, that's what happened," said Kensuke.
"然后...对，事情就是这样，" 肯介说道。

The four pilots and their friends were in the cafeteria, escaping another hot and sunny day.
四位飞行员和他们的朋友正在食堂里，避开又一个烈日炎炎的白天。

Toji leaned back in his seat, eyebrows raised. "So all she wanted was some family photos? Huh."
透二靠回座位，眉头一扬。“原来她只是想要些家庭照片啊？真是。”

"She might have considered asking for more if we hadn't broken up your ring," Asuka noted.
"若非我们的戒指破裂，她或许会考虑索要更多。"飞鸟指出。

"I do not see much of an issue here," said Rei. "Akera wanted something that Kensuke could provide. He provided it."
Rei 说：'我看这里没什么大问题，Akera 想要的东西 Kensuke 能提供，他也确实提供了。'

"It's like if... if somebody had a hundred thousand yen and just wanted a candy bar," replied Toji with a vague wave of his hands as he came up with the analogy. "The candy ain't worth nearly that much, but they're still gonna pay the hundred-kay just to get it."
这就像...如果某人手头有一百万日元，却只想要买一条巧克力棒，" Toji 边说边挥了挥手，想出了这个比喻。"那巧克力棒根本不值那么多钱，但他们还是会毫不犹豫地花掉这一百万。

"But why would they make such an unwise purchase?"
但他们为何要做出这样不明智的购买呢？

"Because they really want it."
因为他们确实很想要。

"Your analogy needs some work, Suzuhara," Asuka remarked. "Having money isn't the same as having blackmail material on someone."
你的比喻得改改了，铃原，" 明日香指出。"有钱和掌握某人的把柄是两码事。

"Yeah... well... you try thinking of something better at a moment's notice!" Toji retorted.
"是啊...嗯...你倒是试试看，片刻之间能想出什么更好的办法！" 东二反驳道。

Asuka shrugged dismissively. "I don't feel like trying to work out what's going through that girl's head."
明日香不屑地耸了耸肩。“我懒得去猜那女孩心里到底在想些什么。”

"Well anyway," Hikari interjected. "It's been a few days now, Kensuke. Have you heard anything from Akera about the photos?"
对了，"光打断道，"已经好几天了，健介。你有没有从明那里得到关于那些照片的消息？

Kensuke shook his head. "No. I'm choosing to believe that means she's happy with them. I'm not about to put myself back on her radar."
健介摇摇头说：“不，我宁愿相信她和他们在一起很开心。我不想再让自己引起她的注意。”

"Smart boy," Asuka snarkily remarked. "Maybe now you can focus more on your Eva training."
真是个聪明的家伙，" 明日香带着一丝讽刺说道，"或许你现在能把更多精力放在 Eva 训练上了。

The five minute warning bell rang, signalling the end of the lunch period. Everybody got to their feet and began filing out of the cafeteria.
五分钟的预备铃响起，预示着午餐时间结束。大家纷纷起身，开始有序地离开食堂。

"Asuka!" Hikari called out over the hubbub. "Can I talk to you for a second? I've got a really big favour to ask of you!"
Asuka！" Hikari 在嘈杂声中高声呼喊，"能耽误你一会儿吗？我有个大忙想请你帮忙！

Asuka blinked at her friend. "Uh... okay..." She waved at the others to continue and slowed down to keep pace with Hikari, who was looking somewhat nervous now as she lagged behind.
明日香眨着眼望向朋友，迟疑地说：“呃……好吧……”她向其他人挥手示意继续前行，同时放慢脚步，与显得有些紧张、已经落后的光并肩而行。

"Um... so, there's this guy in Kodama's class," Hikari hesitantly began, her eyes looking anywhere but at Asuka. "He's been talking about you. Like... a lot."
嗯...是这样的，光犹豫着开口，眼神四处游移，就是不敢直视明日香。“光田班上有个男生，最近一直在谈论你，说得挺多的。”

Asuka sighed. Was this just going to be another fanboy? She already had to deal with far too many letters from 'secret admirers' clogging up her locker. Earlier in the year she had simply thrown them all out, since she couldn't read written kanji as well and didn't feel like wasting her time. But after Shinji had helped her out on that front she had, on occasions when she had nothing better to do, read a few of the less immediately insane-looking letters, and even they went no further than gushing about 'unsurpassed beauty' and other such purple rubbish.
明日香叹了口气。难道这又是一个狂热粉丝？她已经受够了那些自称“秘密仰慕者”的信件，它们塞满了她的储物柜。年初时，她因为读不懂手写汉字，索性将它们统统丢弃。自从真嗣帮她克服了阅读障碍后，偶尔闲来无事，她会挑几封看起来不那么疯狂的信件读一读，然而内容无非是吹捧她的“绝世美貌”之类的华丽辞藻。

It was clear that all they saw was the surface. Of course she was gorgeous, there was no denying that, but that was as far as the letters went. Well, that and occasionally obsessing over her being an Evangelion pilot. Even then, though, she could read between the lines and tell that the 'admirer' just wanted a trophy.
显然，他们仅停留在表面印象。她的美貌毋庸置疑，但信中的内容也就止步于此。偶尔，他们会对她作为新世纪福音战士驾驶员的身份表现出迷恋。即便如此，她也能从字里行间察觉到，这位“仰慕者”不过是想拥有一个炫耀的资本。

Just like those two harpies in Class 2-A that kept looking at Shinji, which she now knew about thanks to Rei's reconnaissance.
正如 2-A 班那两位一直盯着真嗣的女生，她现在通过绫波的侦查已经知晓了。

Hikari had still been talking while Asuka's mind had drifted off, but she caught the expectant look on the class representative's face when Hikari stopped talking.
光一直在说话，而明日香的思绪早已飘远，但当光话音刚落，她注意到了班长脸上那充满期待的表情。

"Ugh. Fine, I guess I'll go on this blind date," she grouched. It wasn't worth the effort to say no and then come up with a reason that would satisfy her friend. "Where and when am I supposed to meet him?"
唉，行吧，看来我得去应付这场相亲了。" 她嘟囔着。拒绝太麻烦，还得想个让朋友信服的理由。"我该在哪儿，几点见他呢？

Hikari's face lit up. "This Saturday, at the amusement park. I'll let Kodama know tonight so she can tell him."
光的脸庞顿时明亮起来。"这个星期六，咱们去游乐园。我今晚就通知小玉，让她转告他。"

Asuka raised a warning finger. "But if this guy ends up being just another pervert, he's going to get kicked so hard his granddad will be clutching his balls in agony."
明日香竖起警告的手指说：“不过，要是这家伙只是个色狼，那他可得小心了，我一脚下去，他爷爷都得跟着疼。”

A passing male student cringed and his hands twitched towards his groin.
一名经过的男学生皱了皱眉，手不自觉地朝下体挪动。

"...Well... let's hope it doesn't get that far," Hikari weakly replied after a moment, as they arrived at their classroom with a minute to spare.
"...唉...希望事情别发展到那一步，" 光无力地应了一句，片刻后，他们刚好提前一分钟走进了教室。

"Everything alright, Asuka?" Shinji asked as she sat down in front of him.
"一切都还好吗，明日香？" 真嗣在她坐到面前时问道。

"Yeah, it's fine," Asuka said over her shoulder. "Just got a date this weekend."
嗯，没事，" 明日香扭头说道，"这周末我有个约会。

"...O-oh... okay." ...哦，好吧。

As the teacher came in to start the class, part of Asuka's mind wondered at Shinji's tone of voice. He'd sounded almost... despondent. She mentally shrugged it off. Shinji was probably just a little unhappy at being left alone on the weekend, but he could always visit another friend if he wanted some company.
老师走进教室准备上课时，明日香心里的一部分却在琢磨真嗣的语气，他听起来似乎有些沮丧。她心里一耸肩，没太当回事。真嗣可能只是因为周末独自一人而感到有些不快，但如果他想要人陪伴，完全可以去找其他朋友。

It wasn't like there was anything important happening this weekend, anyway.
这个周末本来也没什么大事。

### Chapter 29 Now That I'll Believe

As per usual for the weekend, Shinji stayed in bed a little longer than on a school day, but was still first to get up. Asuka wasn't up yet, and he wasn't feeling particularly hungry either, so he went to the bathroom. A shower woke him up fully, and he was all prepared to relax the day away at home.
周末惯例，真嗣比平日上学时多赖了会儿床，但依旧是第一个起床的。明日香尚未醒来，他也不太饿，便径直去了浴室。洗完澡，他精神焕发，准备在家悠闲地消磨时光。

Too bad there was nothing interesting on television again besides morning news shows hawking suspect products. Shinji turned his gaze skyward and sighed as yet another ad went on about, of all things, toothpicks. The television was soon switched off and he got to his feet. There was something that would be happening today, but it was just out of mental reach. A calendar in the kitchen told Shinji the precise date, causing his breath to catch in his throat and his heart to sink.
电视上除了早间新闻节目推销可疑产品外，又没什么吸引人的内容，真嗣不禁感到失望。他抬头望天，叹了口气，因为又一则广告开始大谈特谈，居然是牙签。他随即关掉电视，站起身来。今天似乎有什么重要的事，但就是记不起来。厨房里的日历提醒了他确切的日期，让他心头一紧，情绪低落。

"Oh..." he whispered. "It's... that today..."
哦……" 他轻声道。"原来……是今天……

"What today?" 今天有什么事？

Shinji turned around, and immediately jumped in shock at the fact that Asuka, looking rather rumpled, was standing directly behind him. She'd managed to sneak up on him, focused as he was on the calendar and the one day of the year he hated over all others. He took a moment to recover from the surprise before saying, "Good morning Asuka."
真嗣一转身，顿时吓了一跳，只见明日香头发凌乱地站在他身后。她趁他全神贯注地盯着日历上那个令他厌恶至极的日子时，悄无声息地靠近了他。他定了定神，然后开口道：“早上好，明日香。”

Asuka tilted her head in greeting. "Morning. Ready for breakfast now?"
明日香歪着头打招呼：“早啊。准备好去吃早餐了吗？”

"Yeah, sure." 当然可以。

After breakfast, prepared quickly and efficiently by the two teenagers as they put their synchronisation quirk to good use, Asuka went to the bathroom for a shower while Shinji cleaned up. Echoes of the synchronisation remained for a couple of minutes, and he had to stop himself from passing a plate to the air next to him. At the same time he heard a sound from the bathroom followed by a muffled German curse, which made the corners of his mouth tilt upwards. Sometimes their synchronisation wasn't a pain in the neck outside of piloting.
早餐后，两位少年迅速且高效地完成了准备工作，巧妙地运用了同步的特性。接着，明日香前往浴室洗澡，真嗣则负责清理。同步的余韵持续了几分钟，他几次差点将盘子递给身旁的虚空。就在这时，浴室传来一声响动，随后是一句含糊的德语咒骂，令他不禁嘴角上扬。看来，他们的同步在驾驶之外，偶尔也能带来些许乐趣。

Once the dishes were done Shinji headed off to the lounge room, but stopped at the calendar again. There was only one good thing he could think of about today: since he was in Tokyo-3, he wouldn't be sitting on a train for hours just to spend a minuscule amount of time awkwardly staring at-
洗完碗碟，真嗣本打算去客厅，却在日历前再次驻足。今天唯一让他感到庆幸的是：既然已在第三新东京市，就不必再忍受数小时火车之旅，只为尴尬地与某人短暂对视。

"Gotcha again!" 又被我逮到了！

"Gah!" 啊！

Shinji glared at Asuka as his heart slowly retreated back down his throat to its normal resting place, still hammering away. She was fresh out of the shower, her slightly damp hair still unbound by A-10 clips and smelling so strongly of strawberries the scent seemed to pervade the whole room. The sheer sight of her was doing nothing to slow down his heartbeat, and he silently prayed that she couldn't hear it.
真嗣瞪着刚出浴的明日香，心跳如鼓，好不容易才从喉咙回落到胸腔。她头发微湿，未用 A-10 夹束起，草莓香气浓郁得仿佛充盈了整个房间。她的模样让他的心跳愈发剧烈，他暗自祈祷她听不见这心跳声。

"That's twice now I've caught you staring at the calendar," she remarked with a cheeky grin. "Something must be happening today, right?"
这已经是第二次逮到你盯着日历看了，"她带着调皮的微笑说，"今天肯定有什么特别的事，不是吗？

"Well... yes," Shinji mumbled. "But it's... not something to look forward to."
嗯...确实如此，" 真嗣低声说道。"但这...实在不是什么值得期待的事。

Asuka's grin faded, and her head pulled back slightly as she gave him an inquisitive look. "Oh? What is it?"
明日香的笑容逐渐褪去，她微微后仰，好奇地打量着他。"哦？什么事？"

He shook his head. "Please... I don't want to think about it any more than I absolutely have to."
他摇摇头说：“求你了...我真的不想再多考虑这件事了。”

"...Alright, fine. But Shinji... remember what you said about how you'd listen to me whenever I wanted to talk?" Shinji gave her a nod. "That goes both ways. If you ever decide to talk to me about... whatever, then I'll drop everything to hear you out. Got it?"
...好吧，行。但真嗣...你还记得你说过，只要我想说话，你随时都会倾听吗？" 真嗣向她点了点头。"这应该是双向的。如果你决定和我分享...任何事情，我也会立刻放下手头的事来倾听。明白了吗？

"...Thanks, Asuka." He glanced at the clock. "I should really get ready to head out. Don't you have a date today as well?"
...谢谢你，明日香。" 他看了一眼时钟。"我得赶紧准备出门了。你今天不也有个约会吗？

Asuka groaned. "Yeah, I'm really only doing it to ensure that Hikari never bothers me with trying to set up blind dates again. I'm sure nothing's going to come of this date, especially considering how obsessed the guy apparently is with me."
明日香叹息道：“嗯，我这么做主要是为了让光别再给我安排相亲了。我敢打赌这次约会肯定没戏，尤其是那男的对我似乎迷得不行。”

"Well... you never know," said Shinji. "He might not be a complete moron. So... good luck, I guess."
嗯...世事难料，" 新二说道。"他或许并非全然愚笨。那么...祝你好运吧。

As he headed off to his room, he heard an amused snort from behind him and smiled slightly. While his mood wasn't going to improve that easily, because of what he had yet to go through before this day was over, Shinji's heart at least felt a little lighter and calmer thanks to Asuka's declaration. And for some reason, he actually felt relieved that she wasn't expecting the date to go well.
他走向房间时，身后传来一声轻笑，让他不禁微微一笑。虽然他的心情并未因此立刻好转，毕竟这一天结束前还有许多挑战等着他，但明日香的话至少让他的心感到了一丝轻松与宁静。不知何故，她对这次约会不抱期望，反倒让他感到一丝宽慰。

In his bedroom, Shinji stared at the contents of his wardrobe, trying to decide what to wear. While he'd much rather stay home and forget about the day entirely, and his father would most likely not even notice his absence, it felt like he would be giving up. Besides, this year it actually seemed like the man had started to remember he had a son. Eventually he decided upon, of all things, his school uniform. Everything else was just too casual for such a serious event as this. Once fully dressed he went over the route he'd have to take in his head, then slid open the door to his room.
在卧室里，真嗣凝视着衣柜中的衣物，犹豫着该穿什么。尽管他更想留在家里，彻底忘掉这一天，而且父亲多半也不会察觉他的缺席，但内心深处却有种放弃的感觉。况且，今年父亲似乎真的开始意识到自己有个儿子了。最终，他决定穿上的是校服，其他衣物对于如此重要的场合来说都显得过于随意。穿戴整齐后，他在心中默念了一遍要走的路线，随后推开了房门。

In her bedroom, Asuka stared at the contents of her wardrobe, trying to decide what to wear. While she didn't have enough interest in the date to dress to the nines, she didn't care so little as to not bother at all. Besides, there was every chance that her blind date would be a pervert, going by Hikari's description of him. Eventually she decided upon a green, high-necked dress that she hadn't worn since purchasing it. Now seemed as good a time as any. Once fully dressed she double checked the address of the amusement park, confirming to herself that she knew exactly how to get there, and slid open the door to her bedroom.
在卧室里，明日香凝视着衣柜中的衣物，思索着该穿什么。尽管她对这次约会并不热衷于精心打扮，但也不至于完全不放在心上。毕竟，按照光的说法，她的盲约对象很可能是个色狼。最终，她挑了一件绿色高领连衣裙，这是她买来后一直未曾穿过的。现在穿它似乎正合适。穿戴妥当后，她再次确认了游乐园的地址，确保自己知道怎么走，随后拉开了卧室的门。

She stepped out into the hall and almost smacked right into Shinji, who'd just done the same thing. They both backed up a little and stared nonplussed at each other.
她刚踏入大厅，险些与同时走出的真嗣撞个满怀。两人各自退后一步，相视无言，一时愣住。

"...This, uh... this synchronisation thing we have is really something, huh?" Shinji commented with a weak chuckle.
"...哎，我们之间的这种同步感，真是挺特别的，不是吗？" 真嗣苦笑着说道。

"Hah." Asuka ruefully shook her head. "Well, unless you've also got a blind date at the amusement park I don't think we have much to worry about anymore."
呵呵。" 明日香苦笑着摇摇头，"好吧，除非你也在游乐园有场盲约，不然我想我们没什么可担心的了。

His expression changed to something unreadable. "...No. Nothing like that."
他的神情变得深不可测。“……不，绝非如此。”

Surprised by his sudden mood shift, Asuka took a step closer. "If whatever you're doing today has you this unhappy, why bother going?" she asked concernedly.
阿苏卡被他突如其来的情绪变化吓了一跳，向前迈了一步。“既然今天的事让你这么不高兴，何必勉强自己去呢？”她关切地问道。

Shinji averted his eyes. "It's... something I just have to do. Especially since my father will be there." His eyes slowly returned to meet hers. "...I'll see you later."
真嗣垂下眼帘，低声道：“这是我不得不做的事，尤其是我父亲也会在场。”片刻后，他重新看向她，轻声说：“...待会儿见。”

Without waiting for a reply, Shinji trudged down the hallway and out of the apartment. When the front door hissed shut, Asuka let out a sigh. She hadn't seen him this depressed since just before he ran away. Whatever was happening today had to be-
未等回应，真嗣便拖着沉重的脚步穿过走廊，走出了公寓。随着前门嘶的一声关闭，明日香不禁叹息。自他上次离家出走以来，她还未曾见他如此消沉。今天所发生之事，必定非同小可——

…

Asuka frowned, her mind whirring. Shinji was going somewhere with his father, and it wasn't for a friendly chat over lunch. Rather, it was a much more sombre affair...
明日香眉头紧锁，思绪如飞。真嗣与父亲此行，绝非轻松的午餐闲谈。显然，这是一场更为沉重的会面……

Her eyes suddenly lit up and she resisted the urge to snap her fingers; clearly, Shinji was going to visit his mother's grave today. She herself had tried to keep up with that with her own mother's grave once upon a time, until it became too painful to continue. But Asuka had simply cursed at her mother's gravestone before deciding never to return, and that was years ago. Yet somehow, Shinji was constantly finding the strength to continue even when it meant being in the presence of his one remaining parent, a man who had fobbed him off onto a total stranger.
她的双眼突然闪烁着光芒，她抑制住想要打响指的冲动；显然，真嗣今天要去祭拜他母亲的墓地。她自己也曾试图坚持去探望自己的母亲，直到这变得太过痛苦而无法继续。但明日香只是对着母亲的墓碑咒骂了几句，便决定再也不回去，那已是多年前的事。然而，真嗣不知怎的，总能找到继续前行的勇气，哪怕这意味着要面对他仅剩的亲人，一个将他推给陌生人的父亲。

There had to be something she could do to cheer Shinji up, and if it weren't for the blind date she could have prepared something for his return, but now it would have to wait until she got back home.
她一定有办法让真嗣振作起来，若非这场相亲，她本打算在他归来时准备些惊喜，如今只能等回家后再做打算了。

Before leaving, Asuka patted the top of her head and returned to her bedroom. A minute later she exited the apartment, her signature A-10 clips firmly in place. Now fully armed, she headed off to the most reluctant date she'd likely ever have.
出发前，明日香轻拍头顶，返回卧室。片刻后，她离开公寓，标志性的 A-10 发夹已牢牢固定。全副武装的她，踏上了或许是她最不情愿的一次约会。

The cemetery stretched out over a gently sloped hill, the grave markers perfectly equidistant from each other. Shinji couldn't even begin to guess how many there were, and this wasn't the only cemetery in the greater Hakone area dedicated primarily to the victims of Second Impact. Even after all his previous visits, Shinji would have been hard pressed to remember where the grave was for his mother. Only his father's presence near the top of the hill, as unmoving as the thousands of marble markers, served to remind him of where to go. The sight of the man caused Shinji's right hand to momentarily clench around the bouquet of flowers he'd bought on the way.
墓地顺着缓坡绵延，墓碑整齐排列，间距一致。真嗣数不清这里有多少墓碑，这还只是箱根地区众多主要纪念第二次冲击遇难者的墓地之一。尽管之前来过多次，真嗣仍难以回忆起母亲墓地的具体位置。唯有父亲静立在山顶附近，如众多大理石墓碑般凝固，才指引了他前行的方向。见到父亲，真嗣不由得紧握住手中的花束，那是他来时路上买的。

The walk up the hill felt like it went on forever; the rows of markers stretching out further and further each time Shinji glanced around, until they looked to reach the horizon. Already the main cemetery gate was far behind him, yet his father was seemingly no closer.
攀登山坡的路程似乎永无尽头；一排排墓碑不断延展，每当真嗣回头望去，它们似乎又向更远处延伸，直至仿佛触及天际。主墓园的大门早已远在身后，然而他的父亲却依旧遥不可及。

Many graves in all the cemeteries were empty; their intended occupants lost to floods and other natural disasters, wars, or simply pronounced dead after not being seen for years. His own mother was one such victim. Shinji had no idea what had actually happened to her, except that there hadn't even been a funeral. And try as he might, he couldn't even remember much about the woman who had given birth to him. How did she style her hair? What were her favourite clothes? What did her voice sound like?
所有墓地中众多坟墓空空如也，它们本应的主人或因洪水、自然灾害、战争而失踪，或因多年未见而被宣告死亡。真嗣的母亲便是其中之一。他对她的遭遇一无所知，只知道连葬礼都未曾举行。他竭力回忆，却连关于生母的记忆都模糊不清。她的发型如何？她钟爱的服饰是什么？她的声音又是怎样的呢？

Shinji closed his eyes and exhaled sadly. He idly wondered if it was possible to strike some kind of deal with Bwynvienne, or somebody like her, to get those details. Although... what would the price be?
真嗣闭上双眼，带着哀伤深深叹息。他心不在焉地思索，能否与布温维尼恩这样的人谈成一笔交易，换取那些信息。然而...这背后又需要付出怎样的代价呢？

"Hello, Shinji." 你好，新二。

He opened his eyes with a start to see that he was about to walk right past his father, who had not averted his gaze from the grave marker.
他突然睁开眼，意识到自己差点就从父亲身边走过，而父亲始终凝视着墓碑，目光未曾偏离。

"You seem somewhat distracted."
你看起来有点走神。

"Y-yeah," Shinji reticently replied. "I was just... thinking about... her."
嗯，是的，" 真嗣有些迟疑地回答。"我只是在...想着...她。

His father's head tilted an imperceptible fraction. "As am I."
他的父亲头微微一倾，动作细微到几乎无法察觉。“我也是。”

The two Ikaris stood in silence before the marker for some time. Shinji kept shifting slightly, trying to think of something to say. His father, on the other hand, stood perfectly still with his hands clasped behind his back, not even slightly swaying.
两位伊卡瑞斯在纪念碑前静默良久。真嗣不时地微微挪动，努力寻找开口的契机。而他的父亲则稳如泰山，双手背在身后，纹丝不动。

"You haven't come here for three years." Surprisingly, the elder Ikari was the one to break the silence.
"你已经三年没来过这里了。"出乎意料，是老伊卡里打破了沉默。

Shinji flinched in embarrassment. The last time he'd come to this cemetery, he'd shouted at his father for seemingly not caring about his mother's death before running off back to the train station. "...Did you visit during that time?" he cautiously asked.
真嗣尴尬地缩了缩身子。上次他踏足这片墓地，曾对父亲怒吼，责怪他对母亲的离世漠然置之，随后便奔回了火车站。“……那期间，您来过吗？”他谨慎地探问。

"Of course." 当然。

"Of course..." Shinji repeated. "Meanwhile, I talked myself out of it by saying it was too far."
当然……" 真嗣又重复了一遍。"我其实是在说服自己，那地方太远了，不值得去。

"But that was not the real reason."
但这并非真正的原因。

"No. I was just... too embarrassed to come back."
不，我只是... 因为太尴尬，所以没敢回来。

"And yet now you are here."
然而此刻你就在这里。

Shinji took a deep breath. "I guess I... talked myself into it this time. I'm already in Tokyo-3, after all."
真嗣深吸一口气，心想：“看来这次是我自己说服了自己。毕竟，我已经身在第三新东京市了。”

"Hrm." His father went silent.
"嗯。"他的父亲陷入了沉默。

"And I... um..." Rubbing the back of his head, Shinji decided to go for broke. "I wanted to take this time to ask you something."
我...嗯..." 新二挠着后脑勺，决定豁出去。"我想借此机会问你一件事。

"...You may ask, but you may not like the answers I have for you."
...你或许会问，但恐怕我给出的答案不会让你满意。

"At this point I'll take any answer over not knowing anything at all." Another breath, and then another. "Father, did you... forget anything about Mum when she died?"
此时此刻，我宁愿得到任何答案，也不愿一无所知。" 深吸一口气，接着又是一口。"爸爸，妈妈去世时，你...有没有遗漏关于她的事情？

Though the man's eyes were still hidden by the ever-present orange shades, Shinji thought he saw a hint of something new in them. "No, Shinji," his father replied. "Every aspect of your mother has been engraved into my mind. I could no more forget about her than I could forget to breathe."
尽管那人的眼睛依旧被那副常伴左右的橙色太阳镜遮挡，真嗣却感觉他眼中似乎透露出些许新意。“不，真嗣，”他的父亲回应道，“你母亲的每一个细节都已铭刻在我的记忆中。我忘记她，就如同忘记呼吸一般不可能。”

"So then why can't I remember anything?" Shinji pressed on. "Her face, her voice, her personality... I don't know anything about Mum anymore! All I can remember is that... that I had a mother until suddenly I didn't! What happened?!"
那为什么我什么都记不起来呢？" 真嗣继续追问。"妈妈的脸，她的声音，她的性格... 我全然不知了！我只记得曾经有过妈妈，突然间就不见了！到底发生了什么？

Though Shinji's voice was rising and panicky, his father remained stoic; eyes still on the marker, until suddenly his head tilted down until his chin rested on his chest. "As I said, I remember everything about Yui. Including what happened." He turned his head to stare at Shinji. "But I will not tell you."
尽管真嗣的声音带着恐慌越来越高，他的父亲却依旧面无表情；双眼紧盯着标记，突然间，他的头低垂至胸前。“我记得关于唯的一切，包括所发生的事。”他转头凝视着真嗣，“但我不会告诉你。”

"Why not?!" Shinji demanded, petulantly stomping a foot.
"凭什么不行?!" 真嗣不高兴地跺脚追问。

"What happened to Yui was exceedingly traumatic," said his father. "There is only one thing I would ever wish to forget about her, and that is the circumstances of her death. I will not tell you because I refuse to make you relive that day."
Yui 的遭遇极为创伤，"她的父亲说道，"唯有一事我愿从记忆中抹去，即她离世的情形。我不会向你透露，因我不愿让你重温那日的痛苦。

The anger fled Shinji, leaving him feeling cold and hollow. "Relive... Was I... there when it happened?"
怒气从真嗣身上退去，留下他感到一阵冰冷和空洞。"重现...我当时...在场吗？"

"Indeed. You ended up catatonic for a few days afterwards. I will not say any more on the matter. If you have forgotten, it is because your own mind wanted to forget."
确实如此。你后来几天一直处于木僵状态。关于这件事，我不会再多提。如果你已经忘记，那是因为你的内心选择遗忘。

Shinji brought up his left hand to rub at his forehead. "Wanted to forget... so badly that Mum has been almost completely erased from my mind." He chuckled once, humourlessly. "What a pair we are. Me who's forgotten everything, and you who remembers it all." The hand dragged down his face before flopping back to his side. "What about photos? Surely I could at least see what she looked like."
真嗣抬起左手，轻揉着额头。"我曾多么渴望忘记...以至于妈妈几乎从我的记忆中彻底消失了。"他自嘲地笑了一声，毫无笑意。"我们俩真是绝配。我忘得一干二净，而你却记得清清楚楚。"手缓缓从脸上滑落，最终无力地垂在身旁。"那照片呢？至少让我看看她的模样吧。"

"I destroyed all our photos of her," his father grimly stated. "For me, it hurt too much at the time to see her face. For you, there was a chance that seeing her again could trigger a relapse."
我销毁了所有她的照片，"他的父亲沉重地说。"那时，我实在无法承受看到她的面容。而你，再次见到她可能会导致病情反复。

"...So there's nothing? Nothing left of her at all?"
...那么，她真的什么都没留下吗？一点痕迹都没有？

"No." His father hesitated, then raised a hand to point at the grave marker. "There is not even a body in this grave."
不。"他的父亲迟疑片刻，随后抬起手指向墓碑。"这坟墓里连尸体都没有。

Shinji stared listlessly at the marker. So this was just another empty grave among thousands...
真嗣目光呆滞地凝视着那块墓碑。原来这只是众多空坟中的一座而已...

The sound of jet engines reached his ears; quiet at first, but growing steadily louder. Shinji looked up to see a NERV VTOL aircraft heading towards them.
喷气发动机的轰鸣声起初微弱，随后逐渐增强，传入他的耳中。真嗣抬头一看，一架 NERV 的垂直起降飞机正朝他们飞来。

"I must return to my work," said his father as the aircraft hovered over them. The downwash sent dirt and dust flying through the air around them. The man raised his voice to be heard over the machine. "The war against the Angels continues on, regardless of our own lives."
我得回去工作了，"他的父亲在飞机悬停于他们头顶时说道。下方的气流卷起了四周的尘土。为了盖过机器的轰鸣声，男人提高了嗓门。"与天使的战争还在继续，不管我们个人的安危。

"Yeah..." Shinji looked up at his father. "But... I'm kinda glad we had this talk, even if it leaves me with even more questions."
嗯..." 真嗣仰望着父亲。"不过... 我挺庆幸我们能聊这些，尽管这让我又多了不少疑问。

"Perhaps one day you will find the answers you seek, Shinji." His father stepped up into the aircraft and slapped the metal hull twice. "Farewell."
或许有一天，真嗣，你会找到你追寻的答案。" 他的父亲登上飞机，轻拍了两下机身，道了声："再见。

As the aircraft lifted off, Shinji thought he caught a glimpse of blue hair in the passenger compartment before the door slid closed. He covered his eyes as the downwash shifted and the billowing dust tried to blind him. When the wind settled down, he lowered his arm to watch the aircraft retreat into the distance. A crinkling sound directed his attention to the bouquet still clutched in his right hand. The wind had blown some of the petals off, but the flowers were still intact.
飞机起飞之际，真嗣似乎在客舱门关闭前瞥见了一缕蓝发。随着下洗气流的变动，扬起的尘土几乎让他睁不开眼，他只好用手遮挡。待风势减弱，他放下手臂，目送飞机渐行渐远。此时，右手紧握的花束传来沙沙声，吸引了他的注意。尽管有些花瓣被风吹落，但花束依旧完好无损。

Kneeling down next to the empty grave, he dug a shallow hole; just enough to wedge the bottom of the bouquet in while the top rested against the marker. He patted the dirt back into the hole to hopefully keep the flowers from tipping over, then stood up and brushed off his knees.
跪在空荡的墓旁，他挖了个浅浅的坑，让花束底部嵌进去，顶部则轻轻倚靠在墓碑上。他用手将土拍实，希望这样能防止花束倾倒，然后站起身，拍去膝盖上的泥土。

"Well..." he mused as he stared at the marker. "I suppose this visit went a lot better than the last one."
嗯……" 他盯着标记沉思，"看来这次访问比上次顺利多了。

While his heart was not exactly light yet, it no longer felt like a lead weight in his chest. Shinji stuck his hands in his pockets and walked out of the cemetery, wondering if Asuka had had a better day than him.
虽然他的心情还没有完全轻松，但胸口的重压已不再像铅块那样沉重。真嗣把手插进口袋，走出墓园，心里琢磨着明日香是否比他今天过得更好。

The theme park stretched out over the landscape. Asuka couldn't even begin to guess how many people there were, but this was apparently the only amusement park in the greater Hakone area. Having never been here before, Asuka was hard pressed to work out where exactly she was supposed to meet her blind date.
主题公园在视野中铺展开来。明日香无法估算这里究竟有多少人，但这里显然是箱根地区唯一的游乐场所。由于初次造访，她难以确定与盲约对象的会面地点。

The queue to get in looked like it would take forever; the line of families and couples growing more and more each time Asuka glanced over at them, until they looked to reach the end of the street.
排队等候的队伍似乎永无尽头；每当飞鸟瞥向那边，家庭和情侣的行列都在不断增长，直到仿佛延伸至街道的尽头。

Asuka closed her eyes and sighed in frustration. She idly wondered if she should just go home and leave the poor sap behind. She knew absolutely nothing about the guy apart from how much he wanted to date her, and that he was a third-year. At least if Shinji had been here, the two of them could have swept any shooting gallery or other such attractions.
明日香闭上双眼，无奈地叹息。她心不在焉地想，或许该回家，把那可怜虫丢下。她对那男生一无所知，除了他渴望与她约会，以及他是三年级生。至少如果真嗣在，他们俩就能轻松玩转射击场或其他娱乐设施。

"Soryu!" 抱歉！

Ah, that must be the sap in question now. Asuka turned around to see...
啊，这肯定就是提到的树液了。明日香转过身来，想要看个究竟...

...Somebody who looked a bit like Shinji. He had a similarly skinny, slightly short build, and almost the exact same nervous look Shinji still couldn't seem to get away from.
...某人长得颇似真嗣。他身材瘦削，个头稍矮，脸上带着与真嗣如出一辙的紧张表情，仿佛这种神情一直如影随形。

"Um... h-hi," he stammered. "Were, um... were you waiting long?"
呃... 你好，" 他有些结巴。"你，呃... 等了很久吗？

...The same hesitant way of speaking too, it seemed. If Asuka didn't know better, she would have sworn that Hikari had done this on purpose.
...似乎连说话方式也带着同样的犹豫。要是明日香不明真相，她简直会以为光是故意为之。

"Yeah, hi," she said by way of greeting. "Lemme guess, the hair gave me away?"
嗨，"她这样打招呼道，"我猜，是我的发型让你认出来了？

A quick shake of her head sent her hair twirling about; an act which caused the boy to blush just like-
她轻轻一摇头，秀发随之旋舞；这动作让男孩一如往常地脸颊泛红

Damnit, she had to stop comparing this guy to Shinji.
真糟糕，她得停止拿这个人跟真嗣作比较。

The boy got his face under control and nodded. "You might just be the only person in Tokyo-3 with red hair. Hard not to notice you. Anyway, you can call me Tatsuya. Nice to finally meet you face to face. Um... Oh yes." He dug a hand into his pocket and withdrew two tickets, passing one to Asuka. "I got us some express tickets so we can skip the lines."
男孩调整了一下表情，点头道：“你可能是东京-3 唯一红发的人，很难不引人注目。对了，叫我龙也吧。很高兴终于能与你面对面相见。嗯...对了。”他伸手从口袋里掏出两张票，递给明日香一张。“我买了快速通行票，这样我们就不用排队了。”

"Nice," Asuka remarked as they headed for the express lane. "Looks like it's gonna be a crowded day."
挺好的，" 飞鸟边说边走向快速通道，"看来今天会很拥挤。

The two of them ran their tickets through the machine to activate the turnstiles, and headed into the park. Asuka let out an appreciative whistle upon taking in the scope of the park. Just from where she was standing she could see at least three roller coasters jutting up into the sky, as well as a drop tower that was likely right in the middle of the park, a Gravitron and swing ride off to her left, and a space-themed swing ship and bumper car attraction off to her left. Various other smaller attractions for kids littered the areas between the bigger rides, along with the requisite food stands, sideshows and other attractions.
他们俩将票通过机器激活旋转门，步入公园。明日香一踏入公园便发出一声赞叹的口哨。仅从她所站之处，便能望见至少三座高耸入云的过山车，以及位于公园中心的跳楼机，左侧则是重力转轮和秋千游艺机，还有太空主题的秋千船和碰碰车设施。大型游乐设施间点缀着各种适合儿童的小型游乐项目，以及必不可少的食品摊位、杂耍和其他娱乐项目。

"Not bad," Asuka remarked, carefully omitting the fact that she'd never actually been to an amusement park before. The tests and training she'd had to go through in the last decade had kind of made up for it though. Besides, absolutely nothing could compare to being in an Evangelion, anyway.
"还不错，"飞鸟评论道，巧妙地避开了自己从未去过游乐园的事实。过去十年的测试和训练在某种程度上弥补了这一缺憾。然而，任何事物都无法与驾驶福音战士的体验相媲美。

"So, um... where do you want to go first, Soryu?" Tatsuya asked.
"那么，嗯...你打算先去哪儿，苏龙？" 达也问道。

"First up, just call me Asuka. And it depends." Asuka glanced at him and raised an eyebrow. "How strong is your stomach?"
首先，叫我明日香就行。这要看情况。" 明日香看了他一眼，挑眉问道："你的胃承受力如何？

XXX

Two roller coasters and a Gravitron was all it took before Tatsuya asked to take a break, but he was smiling as they meandered along the path while his stomach settled. Asuka, against all expectations, was actually enjoying the day so far as well, and not just because she was proving herself to be tougher than a third-year boy. It did help that Tatsuya wasn't harassing her about NERV and the Evangelions. He had asked about the battles she'd been through, and she'd bragged as much as she could to a civilian, but the boy wasn't acting like... well, like Kensuke.
两座过山车和一个重力旋风，就让龙也提议休息一下，尽管如此，他边沿着小径漫步，边让胃部舒缓时，脸上依旧带着笑容。明日香意外地享受着这一天，不仅因为她证明了自己比三年级男生还要坚韧。龙也没有纠缠她关于 NERV 和 EVA 的事，这让她感到轻松。他问起了她参与的战斗，她尽可能地向一个平民炫耀，但这男孩并不像...嗯，不像健介那样。

And so far, he hadn't tried to make a move on her. Not even so much as an 'accidental' bump while moving through the crowds. She couldn't tell whether to be insulted or not. In fact, Tatsuya wasn't even really looking at her, and not in the shy way Shinji sometimes-
至今为止，他并未尝试对她有所行动，连人群中“不小心”的触碰都不曾有过。她不确定是否该感到不悦。实际上，Tatsuya 甚至没有正眼瞧她，这并不像 Shinji 偶尔表现出的那种羞涩。

Damnit. 真糟糕。

Now he looked, his attention drawn by her low growl. "Is... something wrong, Asuka?" he asked.
他转头望去，被她低沉的咆哮所吸引。“怎么了，明日香？”他关切地问。

"Huh?" Asuka rapidly shook her. "Oh, I... um... took one look at the teacup ride and sarcastically went 'wheee'."
嗯？" 明日香急忙摇了摇她。"哦，我...那个...瞥了一眼茶杯转转乐，就嘲讽地说了声'哇哦'。

Tatsuya looked over at the ride and nodded. "Yeah, that's pretty tame even for me." He patted his stomach. "I think I can handle one more real ride before we get something to eat."
龙也看向那边的游乐设施，点头道：“是啊，这个对我来说也很温和。”他拍了拍肚子，“我觉得我还能再体验一个刺激的项目，然后咱们再去吃东西。”

Asuka nodded and steered them towards the drop tower.
明日香点头示意，带领他们朝跳楼机走去。

Five minutes later the two teenagers, along with a dozen or so other thrill-seekers, slowly began to ascend into the sky. Asuka watched the people on the ground get smaller and smaller underneath her dangling legs for a moment before bringing her gaze up. They were already above the treeline; seconds later they were level with the lift hill of the nearest coaster and still ascending.
五分钟后，两位少年与十来个寻求刺激的同伴一同，缓缓升入天际。飞鸟低头看着地面的人群在她的悬空双腿下逐渐缩小，片刻后她抬起目光。此时他们已越过树梢；转眼间，他们与最近过山车的升降坡齐平，且仍在继续攀升。

Asuka blinked in mild surprise. Despite the many times she had been at this height or even higher in her Evangelion, there was still the gradually building anticipation. Here, strapped to a seat in the open air, she had absolutely no control over her situation. The only thing close to this was when she and Shinji were being airlifted towards Israfel.
明日香略带惊讶地眨了眨眼。尽管她曾在驾驶福音战士时多次攀升至更高的高度，那种逐渐升腾的期待感依旧挥之不去。如今，她被固定在露天座位上，对自身处境毫无掌控力。与此相似的体验，唯有她和真嗣被空运前往伊斯拉斐尔的那次。

The seat clicked to a stop at the top of the tower, and Asuka looked out across the landscape towards Tokyo-3 as the wind whipped around the tower. Despite the constant fighting in and around it, the city still looked peaceful. Of course there was quite a bit of construction happening, more than in any 'normal' city, but still.
座椅在塔顶咔哒一声停稳，明日香眺望着东京-3 的风景，风在塔身四周肆意吹拂。尽管城市内外战事频发，它依旧保持着一种宁静。这里的确在进行着比一般城市更为频繁的建设，但那份宁静依旧不变。

"Hey," said Tatsuya. "I don't remember this ride delaying this lo-"
嘿，" Tatsuya 说，"我不记得这个项目会拖这么久——

The drop tower... dropped them.
自由落体塔...让他们体验了自由落体。

Surrounded by screaming people, Asuka grinned at the rapidly approaching ground, barely resisting the urge to join in. With no control, this was a much different feeling than being air-dropped into combat.
四周尖叫声此起彼伏，明日香对着急速逼近的地面咧嘴一笑，几乎要忍不住加入他们的行列。失去控制的感觉，与空降作战时的体验大相径庭。

Unfortunately, the ride only lasted about five seconds from top to bottom.
遗憾的是，从顶端到低端的这段骑行仅持续了大约五秒。

Once they'd passed the ride exit, Tatsuya said, "Wow! What a rush! Is that what piloting is like?"
他们刚过游乐设施的出口，达也就感叹道：“哇！真是太刺激了！驾驶的感觉就是这样吗？”

"Something like that, yeah," Asuka replied. "Takes longer though, and of course there's something else trying to make your life that little bit more entertaining."
差不多就是这样，嗯，" 明日香回应说。"只是耗时更长，而且总有些东西想给你的生活添点乐趣。

Tatsuya nodded, and they headed off to find some lunch.
龙也点头示意，随后他们一同前往寻找午餐。

After lunch and two more less intense rides, Asuka was starting to get suspicious. Tatsuya still had yet to even brush against her hand, or anything else even remotely romantic. Instead the atmosphere around the two of them seemed more like friends or siblings having a day out, rather than two people on a date. She wondered if things would have been like this if she were here with Sh-
午餐过后，又经历了两次较为轻松的骑行，明日香心中渐生疑窦。龙也至今未曾触碰她的手，连一丝浪漫的迹象都没有。两人间的氛围，更像是好友或兄妹共度的一天，而非情侣间的约会。她不禁思索，若此刻是与 Sh 相伴，是否也会是这般光景。

God. Damnit. 天哪，真该死。

Once again Tatsuya directed a concerned look at Asuka after she growled. Before he could say anything, she got in first. "Look, can we sit down somewhere and talk? I've got some questions for you."
龙也再次关切地望向明日香，在她发出低吼之后。他正要开口，明日香抢先一步：“我们能找个地方坐下来谈谈吗？我有些问题想问你。”

Immediately, she noticed Tatsuya's eyes dart nervously around, as if he was looking for an escape route. And then, he let out a long, drawn-out sigh. "...Okay," he mumbled. "But... can we do it somewhere quiet? Please?"
她立刻察觉到龙也的目光不安地四处游移，似乎在寻找逃脱的路径。接着，他深深地叹了口气。“...好吧，”他低声说道，“不过...我们能找个安静的地方谈吗？求你了？”

Asuka stared at him for a moment, before nodding. A quiet spot was soon located near the first aid building, where Tatsuya slumped down on a bench and stared down at the ground. Asuka sat down next to him, and waited.
明日香凝视了他片刻，随即点头同意。不久，他们在急救站旁寻得一处静谧之地，龙也颓然坐于长椅，目光低垂，凝视着地面。明日香挨着他坐下，默默守候。

"So there's a good reason I wanted to go on this date with you," he finally said, after glancing around to see if there was anybody else in earshot. "But it's... not quite for the reason you'd expect."
其实，我之所以想和你约会，背后有充分的理由，"他环视四周确保无人旁听后才说，"但这理由并非你所想象的那样。

"I can tell that already," Asuka remarked.
"我已经可以告诉你了，" 明日香评论道。

"There's some guys in my class who started bragging a lot about their... romantic conquests." Tatsuya rubbed a hand down his face. "I somehow got dragged into it, they started pressuring me about how I've never had a girlfriend, and to try and get them to leave me alone I said I was hoping to... well... date you."
班上有些男生开始炫耀他们的恋爱经历。" 龙也无奈地揉了揉脸，"不知怎的，我也被牵扯进去，他们开始追问我为何从未谈过恋爱，为了摆脱他们的纠缠，我便说希望能...嗯...和你交往。

"Why me?" asked Asuka. "I mean, yeah, I'm an Eva pilot and-"
为什么偏偏是我？" 明日香不解地问。"毕竟，我是 Eva 的驾驶员，这没错，但是-

"It was because you're an Eva pilot that I said your name," Tatsuya interrupted.
"我之所以叫你的名字，是因为你是 Eva 的驾驶员，" 达也插话道。

Asuka drew in a sharp breath. Was this just another boy hoping to hitch their wagon to her star? Another moron looking to profit from her fame? Like how Shinji had caught the eye of those two harpies in 2-A?
明日香倒吸一口凉气。这难道又是某个想攀附她星光的男孩？又一个企图利用她名声获利的傻瓜？就像真嗣引起了 2-A 班那两位悍妇的注意一样？

"I thought you were sufficiently unobtainable that I could get away with simply... well... pretending to lust after you," Tatsuya went on. "I wasn't expecting somebody else to butt in and set us up on a blind date together."
我原以为你高不可攀，足以让我轻松地...嗯...假装对你动心，" 龙也接着说。"没料到竟有人横插一脚，安排我们进行一场盲约。

She didn't like where this conversation was going. "...Then why did you agree to it? You could have just turned it down."
她对这场对话的走向感到不满。“……那你当初为何答应？你完全可以拒绝的。”

"In front of those same guys?" Tatsuya finally looked up from the ground, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. "If I didn't 'jump on the opportunity', they'd want to know why. And... I'm sure as hell not going to tell them why I don't want a girlfriend."
在那些人面前吗？" 龙也终于抬头，紧张地揉着脖子。"如果我不抓住这个机会，他们肯定会追问原因。但我绝对不会告诉他们我不想交女朋友的原因。

Asuka opened her mouth to retort, but hesitated. There was something about the way he'd said that last word. "Wait... you're saying..."
明日香本想开口反驳，却迟疑了。他说出那个词的语气有些异样。"等等...你是说..."

His eyes went right back to the ground. "Y-yeah... it's... really something I don't want anybody at school to even consider... I'm afraid of what could happen to me."
他的眼神又回到了地上。“对、对……这……我真不希望学校里任何人知道……我害怕会有什么后果。”

"I'm not a Japan native, as you can probably tell. Is there something wrong in this country with... that?"
我不是日本人，这一点你应该能看出来。在这个国家，是不是有什么问题...关于那件事？

Tatsuya gave a weak shrug. "Let me put it like this," he said. "Have you actually seen any gay couples around?"
龙也无力地耸了耸肩。“这么说吧，”他道，“你真的见过同性情侣吗？”

Asuka stopped and thought, but all she could think of was the will-they-won't-they between Doctor Akagi and Lieutenant Ibuki. She hadn't exactly been searching, but she was sure any such couples would have been noticed. "No, can't say I have," she finally admitted, leaning back on the bench. "So what now? We're here for the wrong reason, and that bombshell kind of ruined the mood."
明日香停下脚步，思绪飘忽，脑海里全是赤木博士与伊吹少尉之间那种暧昧不明的关系。她并非有意探寻，但若有这样的情侣，她相信自己定能察觉。“不，我确实没注意到，”她最终承认，身体向后靠在长椅上。“那现在怎么办？我们来的理由不对，这个重磅消息也把气氛搞砸了。”

"Well... ah..." Tatsuya's fingers started tapping on his knee. His face was starting to turn incandescent. "I was hoping to work up the courage to... erm... ah... do... do something," he finally forced out, "that would make you slap me. Then I could at least brag that I did that... um... something on the date. And hopefully that would have made them leave me alone."
嗯...啊..." 龙也的手指不由自主地敲打着膝盖，脸颊泛起红晕。"我原本打算鼓起勇气...呃...啊...做...做点什么，"他终于艰难地说出口，"让你忍不住打我。这样我至少能炫耀在约会时干了那...那件事。希望这能让他们别再纠缠我。

Asuka shook her head in disbelief. The poor boy was so shy he couldn't even properly explain what he'd been planning to do. "That's kind of a stupid plan. You're trying to hide the fact that you're-" She paused while somebody walked past them. "-that you're not interested in the fairer sex by dating me, the most sought-after girl at school, and then copping a feel to get a battle scar?"
明日香难以置信地摇了摇头。这个可怜的男孩太羞涩了，连自己原本的打算都说不清楚。“这计划真够蠢的。你想通过和我——学校里最抢手的女孩约会，来掩饰你对异性没兴趣的事实，然后趁机占便宜留下所谓的战斗痕迹？”

"Yeah, it's a dumb idea," Tatsuya mumbled.
"确实，这主意挺蠢的，" 龙也低声自语。

"Besides, by the time Monday comes around there won't even be any evidence of me hitting you."
再者，到了周一，连我打你的证据都不会留下。

Tatsuya nodded, then got to his feet and started pacing back and forth for a moment. Finally, he stopped directly in front of her. "In that case, can you... um... hit me harder then?"
龙也点头后站起身，来回踱步片刻，最终停在她正前方。"既然如此，你能不能...嗯...再用力打我一下？"

"Excuse me?! What, you're asking for a black eye or something?"
你说什么？！难道你是想讨打吗？

His eyes lit up. "Yes! That would be perfect! It'd look like I'd really... ah... tried something on you!"
他的眼睛一亮，兴奋地说：“对！那样就太完美了！看起来我确实……嗯……对你下了不少功夫！”

Asuka blinked slowly. "...Are you sure about this? It's not exactly comfortable to get punched in the face."
明日香慢慢眨了眨眼，问道：“……你真的确定吗？被打脸可一点也不舒服。”

"If it means I can get them off my back, I'd even go so far as to let you break a bone!"
如果能让我摆脱他们的纠缠，我甚至不惜让你打断我一根骨头！

"Whoah." Asuka put her hands up. "Look, you're a decent enough guy, I'm not about to do that unless you try and stick your hand up my dress."
哇哦。" 明日香举起双手说："听着，你人还不错，除非你真想把手伸进我裙子里，否则我不会那样做的。

For a moment, Tatsuya's eyes drifted downwards, then they immediately rose back up to focus on something behind Asuka's head. "...No. Desperate as I am, I would never do something like that."
片刻间，龙也的视线不由自主地向下飘移，但很快又迅速抬起，凝视着飞鸟脑后的某个点。“……不，就算我再怎么绝望，也绝不会做出那样的事。”

"Well... if you're hellbent on this, I can at least give you a bruise," said Asuka, silently thankful. "It'll be much less of a hassle and you won't end up in the hospital while trying to hide something you shouldn't have to."
好吧...既然你这么坚持，我至少可以让你受点皮肉之苦，"飞鸟心中暗自庆幸。"这样事情会简单许多，你也不至于因为隐瞒不该隐瞒的事情而弄到住院。

"Yes, that'll do fine. Um... how do you want to do this?"
好的，这样挺合适。嗯...你打算怎么操作？

It didn't take a genius, college graduate Evangelion pilot to think of a suitable plan. "Sit back down, and keep your arm behind me on the bench. I'll handle the rest. And... sorry for what I'm about to do."
想出一个合适的计划，并不需要天才、大学毕业生或《新世纪福音战士》的驾驶员。"坐回原位，将你的手臂放在我背后的长凳上。其余的交给我。还有... 对即将发生的事，我先说声抱歉。"

"Don't be sorry for helping me," Tatsuya replied with a shake of his head. "Thank you for this, by the way."
不用为帮助我而道歉，" 龙也摇摇头说道，"对了，非常感谢你。

Asuka certainly didn't feel like she deserved his thanks, as she stormed off in a pretend huff after punching the boy in the face and screaming at him in German. She couldn't even bring herself to actually swear; instead she'd just shouted the first song lyric she could think of.
明日香自然不认为自己应得他的感激，她在猛击男孩脸部并用德语怒吼后，佯装愤怒地离去。她连骂人的话都说不出口，只是随口喊出了脑海中闪现的第一句歌词。

Outside the park she finally slowed down and stopped. It was that or walk into a black-suited woman standing in her path.
在公园外，她终于放慢脚步停了下来，否则就会撞上一位身穿黑色套装站在她面前的女士。

"Pilot Soryu, is everything alright?" the woman quietly asked, to which Asuka groaned. Of course Section Two would involve themselves.
"飞行员 Soryu，一切正常吗？"女子轻声询问，Asuka 听后不禁发出一声叹息。果然，第二部门还是插手了。

"Yeah, I just had to help a poor confused young man maintain his cover," she replied with a sigh.
"唉，我刚帮一个迷茫的小伙子保住了他的伪装，"她叹息着说。

"...Ah." The woman shrugged. "That's a shame, he seemed like a nice enough boy."
……唉。" 女人耸肩道，"真遗憾，他给人的印象挺好的。

Asuka didn't even bother asking. Section Two's semi-permanent job was to shadow NERV's pilots after all. "He is. And maybe one day he'll be able to find another nice enough boy."
明日香连问都懒得问。第二部门的长期任务本就是监视 NERV 的驾驶员们。"他是的。说不定哪天他能遇到一个真正不错的小伙子。"

"Would you like a lift home?"
需要我送你回家吗？

"...Sure. I don't feel like going the long way."
...当然。我不想走远路。

XXX

Music reached Asuka's ears as she got close to her apartment door. It took her longer than she'd admit to recognise both the song and its source. It was Shinji on his cello, something he hadn't even seemed to touch since coming to Tokyo-3, playing what sounded like Bach's Cello Suite No. 1.
当明日香走近公寓门时，音乐传入了她的耳中。她花了比自己愿意承认的更长时间才辨认出这首曲子及其演奏者。原来是真嗣在拉大提琴，自从来到东京-3 后，他似乎从未触碰过这件乐器，此刻正演奏着巴赫的大提琴组曲第一号。

She swiped her card across the reader and the door slid quietly open; any noise it made overshadowed by the music. Into the hallway she crept, removing her shoes and padding through the kitchen on bare feet. Pen-pen was there, sitting near the doorway to the lounge room with one of Misato's beers in his clawed flipper, and for the life of her Asuka couldn't work out how the penguin managed to get in. He noticed her and raised the can in a silent greeting, to which she gave a quick nod, spotting a couple more empty cans sitting next to him.
她将卡在读卡器上一刷，门便悄然开启，其声响被音乐所淹没。她轻手轻脚地步入走廊，脱掉鞋子，赤足穿过厨房。企鹅彭彭正坐在通往客厅的门边，一只爪子里夹着美里的啤酒，明日香怎么也想不通这小家伙是怎么进来的。它察觉到她，便举起啤酒罐无声地打了个招呼，她随即点头回应，同时注意到它身旁还有几个空罐子。

The song soon came to an end, to Asuka's great disappointment, but just as she was about to move into the lounge room Pen-pen put up his empty flipper to stop her. Puzzled, she knelt down next to him and watched as he made a circle in the air with a claw. A minute later, cello music filled the apartment again.
歌曲不久便结束了，让明日香深感失望。正当她打算步入客厅之际，企鹅 Pen-pen 伸出空无一物的鳍翅拦住了她。她满心疑惑地蹲在它身旁，目睹它用爪子在空中划出一个圆圈。片刻之后，大提琴的旋律再次弥漫了整个公寓。

The very same cello music, in fact. Shinji was playing Cello Suite No. 1 again. It was a song Asuka hadn't heard since Shinji himself had recorded part of it for her during their penpal days. Back then, the recording had only been a couple of minutes long. And she now recalled him mentioning that the full suite was close to twenty minutes long; far beyond his skill level and longer than he could sit and play for at the time.
实际上，正是那首熟悉的大提琴曲。真嗣再次演奏起了大提琴组曲第一号。这首曲子，明日香自从真嗣在笔友时期为她录制片段后，就未曾再听。那时，录音仅短短几分钟。如今她回忆起，真嗣曾提及完整组曲长达近二十分钟，远超他当时的演奏能力，也超过了那时他能持续演奏的时长。

She raised an eyebrow at Pen-pen. He made the circular motion again, then tapped a claw on his flipper where a human's wrist would be and raised first one claw, then two, alternating between them.
她对 Pen-pen 扬了扬眉。他再次做出圆周运动，随后在鳍状肢相当于人类手腕处轻敲一下，并交替举起一只爪子，接着是两只。

Asuka pursed her lips in thought. Then, in as low a voice as she could, she said, "He's been playing the same song for the last hour or two?"
明日香抿唇沉思，随后尽量压低声音问道：“他这一个多小时一直在重复弹奏同一首曲子吗？”

A nod. 一个点头。

"Like... non-stop?" 是说...一直不停吗？

Pen-pen repeated himself.
彭彭重复了自己的话。

"And you've just been sitting here listening to him?"
你就一直坐这儿听他说吗？

A shrug, then a claw raised in a genetically modified penguin's best possible approximation of a thumbs up.
先是耸了耸肩，随后一只基因改造的企鹅尽力模仿人类，用爪子做出类似竖起大拇指的动作。

"I suppose you don't know anything about why he's doing this, either."
我想你也不清楚他为何要这么做吧。

Pen-pen just stared at her. Despite the lack of human facial features, Asuka could still clearly understand the look of 'what do you think?'. She gave a quiet huff and sat down to wait and enjoy the music.
企鹅只是静静地凝视着她。虽然不具备人类的面部表情，但明日香依然能清晰地读懂那眼神中的“你怎么看？”之意。她轻声哼了一下，随即坐下，静候音乐的流淌，享受此刻的宁静。

From her perspective, Asuka couldn't see much in the lounge room besides the back of Shinji's head poking up over the couch, moving side to side. As far as she could tell Shinji was playing perfectly, but it had been a long time since she'd heard the song or even touched a musical instrument herself, and she wouldn't have been able to pick up on any errors short of a completely dropped note.
从明日香的位置望去，客厅里除了真嗣头顶在沙发上方左右晃动的景象外，她几乎看不到别的。就她观察，真嗣的演奏似乎无可挑剔，然而她已许久未闻那曲调，也久未触碰乐器，除非是明显的漏音，否则她难以察觉任何差错。

She let the song wash over her, using the music to forget about the waste of a day she'd just had. As she began to hear the same part of the song she'd walked in on, Asuka prepared to, sadly, interrupt Shinji. Getting up into a crouch, and ignoring Pen-pen's expression of disapproval, she crept up behind the couch and halted as the song came to an end.
她沉浸在那首歌的旋律中，试图用音乐来抚平刚刚那糟糕一天的记忆。当她再次听到自己进门时那段旋律，明日香无奈地打算打断真嗣。她蹲下身子，不顾企鹅 Pen-pen 不满的表情，悄无声息地绕到沙发后，恰好在歌曲落幕时停住了脚步。

In the sudden silence, Asuka heard Shinji let out a quiet grunt and a hiss, then a sigh. She stood up and saw that he was working his right arm around in circles while flexing the fingers of his left hand. After a minute, he raised the bow back to the cello strings, preparing to play yet again.
在突如其来的静默中，明日香听见真嗣轻声咕哝，接着是嘶嘶声和叹息。她起身一看，发现他正绕圈活动右臂，同时弯曲左手指节。片刻后，他再次将弓搭在弦上，准备重新开始演奏。

But enough was enough. As wonderful as the music was, Shinji was clearly using it to blank his mind, and his body was starting to suffer for it. She could even see sweat running down the back of his neck. Asuka raised her hands, silently apologising for what she was about to do, and brought them together.
但够了就是够了。虽然音乐美妙绝伦，但真嗣显然是在用它来麻痹自己的思绪，身体也因此开始吃不消。她甚至能看见汗水顺着他的后颈淌下。明日香举起双手，默默为即将采取的行动道歉，然后双手合十。

The applause shocked Shinji so badly that both his hands flew up. The bow was flung behind him, whizzing past Asuka's head and flying somewhere into the kitchen. The cello, suddenly unsupported, began to topple towards the floor but some instinct made Shinji's hand shoot out to catch it.
掌声突如其来，令真嗣惊慌失措，双手本能地举起。他手中的弓随之飞出，从明日香头顶呼啸而过，不知落入厨房何处。大提琴因失去支撑而倾斜欲坠，但真嗣的本能反应让他及时伸手扶住。

"Whoops," Asuka quipped, while Shinji put his free hand to his chest.
"哎呀，" 明日香打趣地说，同时真嗣用另一只手捂住了胸口。

"A-Asuka..." said Shinji. "When did you get home?"
"飞鸟，你什么时候回来的？" 真嗣问道。

"About half an hour ago."
大概半小时前。

"And... you didn't say anything?"
那么...你什么也没说吗？

"Of course not. You were busy playing, and I wanted to listen. Speaking of which..." Asuka leaned forward slightly. "How many times did you repeat that song?"
当然不是。你正忙着玩，我则想听。对了……" 明日香身体微微前倾，"那首歌你到底重复了多少遍？

Shinji's eyes darted away for a split second. "Oh, um, only a couple times."
真嗣的眼神瞬间闪躲了一下，答道："哦，嗯，也就几次而已。"

She blinked slowly at him and folded her arms, content to let the liar dig himself deeper.
她缓缓地对他眨眼，双臂交叉，满意地看着这个说谎者自掘坟墓。

"Okay, maybe... a bit more than that?"
好吧，或许...比那还要多一些？

And deeper. 更深入一些。

He quickly gave in. "Alright, alright, I don't know how long. I lost track."
他很快让步了。“行了，行了，我不记得有多久了。我忘了时间。”

She moved her hands to her hips and nodded. "Now that I'll believe."
她双手叉腰，点头说：“这下我信了。”

"I don't think I'm very good though. Sorry if you heard me screw a bit up."
我觉得自己做得并不好。如果听到我出了点差错，还请见谅。

Asuka shrugged. "I'll admit I'm not a classical music expert but it sounded wonderful to me."
明日香耸耸肩说：“我得承认，我对古典音乐并不在行，但对我来说，那旋律确实动听。”

"Wark!" 汪汪！

The two teenagers turned to look at Pen-pen, who was carrying the accidentally discarded bow and giving Asuka a disgruntled look. She pursed her lips. "Okay fine, he told me how long you'd been playing for."
两位少年转头望向企鹅，它正携带着那把意外遗落的弓，对明日香投以不悦的目光。她紧抿双唇，道：“行吧，他告诉我你们已经玩了多久了。”

"Now that I'll believe." 这下我信了。

Asuka's head slowly panned back to Shinji, a look of utter incredulity on her face. He just gave a shrug and a weak smile. "Smartass," she muttered after a moment. "Anyway, as much as I enjoyed your music, you need to take a break from it before your arms cramp up or something."
明日香的视线缓缓移向真嗣，脸上写满了不可思议。他只是耸耸肩，露出一个勉强的微笑。“自以为是的家伙，”她片刻后低声说道。“虽然我很喜欢你的演奏，但你得歇会儿，别让手臂抽筋了。”

Shinji glanced down at his cello and sighed. "I suppose so," he mumbled. Weakly getting to his feet, likely suffering from pins and needles in both legs, he returned the cello to its case, retrieving the bow from Pen-pen with a nod of thanks.
真嗣低头凝视着自己的大提琴，轻叹一声。“应该是吧，”他低声道。他吃力地站起身，双腿或许因久坐而感到麻木，将大提琴放回琴盒，从企鹅 Pen-pen 那里接过弓，点头致谢。

Meanwhile, Asuka moved over to the control for the air conditioner and grunted in disapproval. Shinji had clearly been so intent on using the cello to forget about his problems that he hadn't even bothered turning it on when he got home. She fixed this egregious oversight, sighing in contentment as fresh air began to circulate around the apartment once more.
与此同时，明日香走到空调控制器旁，不满地哼了一声。显然，真嗣一心想用大提琴来忘却烦恼，回家后竟连空调都忘了开。她纠正了这一疏忽，随着新鲜空气再次在公寓中流通，她满意地叹了口气。

"Go and have a shower," she ordered, noticing Shinji's sweat-stained shirt. "While you're doing that, I'm gonna duck next door and grab something from Misato's place that'll help us both forget about today."
去洗个澡，"她吩咐道，目光落在真嗣那件汗湿的衬衫上。"趁你洗澡，我去隔壁美里家拿点东西，让我们都把今天的不愉快抛到脑后。

Cello case in one hand, bow in the other, Shinji absently nodded before fully absorbing what she had just said. "Wait, you're going to steal some of her beer?"
一手拎着大提琴盒，一手握着弓，Shinji 心不在焉地点头，片刻后才反应过来她的话。"什么？你要偷喝她的啤酒？"

"I'd like to," Asuka admitted. "But I'm sure somebody-" she glanced meaningfully at Pen-pen, "-would just rat us out. No, I'm getting something else. You'll see when you get out of the shower; it'll take me about that long to set it up."
我确实想这么做，" 明日香坦言，"但我知道肯定有人——" 她故意瞥了一眼企鹅 Pen-pen，"——会出卖我们。算了，我决定换别的。你洗澡的功夫我就能准备好，到时候你就知道了。

Clearly intrigued, Shinji gave a slight shrug and gingerly walked down the hallway to his bedroom. Asuka looked back down at Pen-pen again. "Pick up your empties. You're free to come and go as much as you want, but I know Misato will ask questions if she sees a beer can in our trash, and I'd rather not waste time trying to convince her they were yours."
显然被吸引了，真嗣轻轻耸了耸肩，小心翼翼地沿着走廊走向自己的卧室。明日香再次低头看向企鹅 Pen-pen，说道：“把你的空罐子收拾好。你来去自由，但我知道美里要是看到垃圾里有啤酒罐，肯定会问，我不想浪费时间去解释那是你的。”

"Wark." Pen-pen rolled his eyes as he gathered up the empty cans.
"嘎。" 彭彭不耐烦地翻了翻白眼，开始收拾散落的空罐。

Asuka took one last glance around the lounge room and paused. She hadn't seen Shinji carrying sheet music, and there was nothing of the sort left in this room. "Hey Shinji," she called out. "Where's the sheet music you were using?"
明日香环视了一圈客厅，停下脚步。她注意到真嗣并没有带着乐谱，房间里也找不到任何乐谱的踪迹。“喂，真嗣，”她提高声音问道，“你之前用的乐谱放哪儿了？”

Shinji's head popped out of his doorway. "What sheet music?"
真嗣从门口探出头来，问道：“什么乐谱啊？”

"You know, what you were referring to while playing a twenty minute song," Asuka clarified.
"你明白的，我指的是在播放那首长达二十分钟的歌曲时，" 明日香解释说。

He blinked owlishly at her. "I don't have any sheet music," he replied. "Besides, Cello Suite No.1 isn't a single song; it's more like several all put together." With that said he ducked back into his room.
他眨着大眼睛望着她，说：“我没带乐谱。再说，《第一大提琴组曲》并非单曲，而是多首曲子汇编而成。”话音刚落，他就退回了自己的房间。

Asuka stared down the hallway in surprise. "You're saying you've memorised twenty minutes worth of cello music. And you can play it perfectly. Yet you think you're 'not very good'?" She put her hands on her head and inhaled deeply. "Goddamn," she breathed out.
明日香惊讶地望向走廊，说道：“你是说你已经记住了二十分钟的提琴曲，并且能完美演奏，却还觉得自己‘不太行’？”她双手抱头，深吸一口气，感叹道：“真是的。”

"I'm sure there's people far better than me," Shinji mumbled as he came out into the hallway with fresh clothes in his hands.
"我敢肯定，比我出色的人多得是，" 真嗣低声说着，手里捧着刚换下的衣服走进了走廊。

"Of course there are," said Asuka. "But they've had decades of practice, probably with expensive tutors and the like. Has anybody actually taught you how to be that good?"
当然有，"明日香说道，"但他们已经练习了几十年，可能还请了昂贵的家教。真的有人教过你如何达到那种水平吗？

"Well... no..." 嗯... 不，不是的。

Asuka walked up and poked him hard in the chest, causing him to rock back slightly. "Stop selling yourself short, Shinji. Accept that you're actually good at what you do."
明日香走上前，用力戳了戳他的胸口，使他不由得后仰。“真嗣，别再小看自己了。要承认，你其实很擅长你所做的事情。”

Shinji's eyes flickered around for a moment, and then he sighed. "I'll... I'll try, Asuka."
真嗣的目光游移了片刻，随后叹息道：“我...我会尽力的，明日香。”

Tempted though she was to quote Star Wars again, Asuka held back. She nodded and stepped aside to let Shinji continue on to the bathroom before heading into the kitchen where Pen-pen was waiting.
虽然明日香很想再次引用《星球大战》，但她还是克制住了。她点头示意，让真嗣继续前往浴室，自己则走进厨房，企鹅彭彭已经在那里等候。

"Wark?" 打仗吗？

Asuka nodded. "Yeah, I'm borrowing Misato's SNES. It's in her bedroom right?"
明日香点头说：“对，我在用美里姐的超级任天堂。是在她房间里吧？”

"Wark." 战斗。

"Bottom of the wardrobe. Right. Thanks."
衣柜最下面一层。靠右边。谢谢。

XXX

Shinji stepped out of the bathroom, already feeling better than he had all day. Even the semi-mindless repetition of Cello Suite No.1 hadn't fully managed to get his mind away from his mother. But then Asuka had shown up out of nowhere, getting his ass moving with promises of something else to take his mind off things.
真嗣从浴室出来，感觉比一整天都要舒畅。尽管他半心半意地重复弹奏着大提琴组曲第一号，思绪仍未能完全从母亲那里抽离。然而，明日香突然出现，用其他事情吸引他注意力的承诺，让他重新振作起来。

"Damnit." 真糟糕。

And speaking of his fiery housemate...
提到他那位火气大的室友...

Stepping into the lounge room, he saw Asuka trying to squeeze between the wall and the back of the television with a jumble of cords in one hand. Pen-pen, another beer in his claw, was relaxing on the sofa watching her work.
他步入客厅，只见明日香正努力挤在墙与电视后侧之间，一手紧握着杂乱的电线。而企鹅企鹅则悠哉地躺在沙发上，爪中还握着一罐啤酒，旁观她的劳作。

"Need a hand?" he asked as Asuka cursed again.
"需要帮忙吗？"他问道，此时明日香又咒骂了一声。

"Yeah, that'd be nice," Asuka grunted. "Friggin' Misato pulled the cable apart and then shoved it in her wardrobe without tying it up properly. So of course it got all tangled up purely to waste my time. Just tilt the television away from the wall a bit so I can see where these damn plugs go."
嗯，那样挺好的，" 明日香不满地说。"葛城这家伙把线扯断了，随手塞进衣柜，连绑都没绑。结果线自然就乱成一团，纯粹是给我添麻烦。稍微把电视从墙边挪开一点，我好看看这些插头该往哪儿插。

He quickly moved to assist, bracing the screen against himself while Asuka plugged the cables in.
他迅速行动，用身体支撑屏幕，同时明日香将电缆接好。

"Right, that's finally done." Asuka stepped over to a bag sitting on the ground, rummaging through it for a moment and pulling out a couple of cartridges. She glanced at them for a moment before shaking her head and putting them to one side as she dove back into the bag.
"好了，总算搞定了。" Asuka 走向地上的背包，伸手在里面摸索了一阵，掏出几发子弹。她扫了一眼，随即摇头，将子弹搁置一旁，继续在包里翻找。

"What are you looking for?" asked Shinji.
"你在寻找什么？" 新二问道。

"Two-player games. I'm not gonna make you just sit around and watch me play. Ah-hah." She pulled out a cartridge with a colourful looking sticker. "...Oh wait, the two player in this is taking turns."
双人游戏。我不会让你只是干坐着看我玩。啊哈。" 她掏出一个贴着彩色贴纸的卡带。"...哦，原来这个游戏的双人模式是轮流进行的。

Shinji glanced at the cartridge as she set it aside. "Gokujou Parodius," he read. "Is it good?"
真嗣瞥了一眼她放在一旁的卡带，念出名字：“极上泡泡龙，这游戏好玩吗？”

"Oh, it's quite fun," said Asuka. "Problem is I'd want you to play Gradius first to get the joke, and for some reason Misato doesn't have that one. I suppose... this one will do for now." She took a cartridge out of the bag, shuffled over to the game console and slotted the game in. The game booted up with a press of the power button to a satisfied smirk from Asuka. Right away she went into the options menu and toggled a couple of settings. "Gotta have Angry Mode."
哦，这可真有趣，"飞鸟说道。"但要想理解这个笑话，你得先玩过《宇宙巡航机》才行，可惜美里这里没有那款游戏。看来...这个将就一下吧。"她从包里掏出一个游戏卡带，挪到游戏机前，将其插入。按下电源键，游戏启动，飞鸟露出了满意的微笑。她随即进入设置菜单，调整了几项设定。"得开启愤怒模式才行。

"Pardon?" 你说什么？

The grin on the Second Child's face was eerily similar to her expression when she was about to murder an Angel.
二号孩子脸上的笑容，与她准备杀害天使时的表情如出一辙，令人不寒而栗。

XXX

After a couple false starts while Shinji got used to the controls, the game was well under way. Asuka kept throwing out tips as her character, a man quite a bit skinnier than his own character who seemed to be made entirely out of steak, threw enemies left and right.
真嗣在适应操作时几次起步不顺，但游戏很快步入正轨。明日香一边操作着比真嗣的角色瘦削许多、仿佛全身都是牛排构成的角色，左右横扫敌人，一边不断给出提示。

"So do you wanna talk about what happened today?" Asuka suddenly asked as her character stole a sword from a guy that looked like a genie.
"那么，你想聊聊今天发生的事情吗？" 明日香突然开口，与此同时，她的角色从一个貌似精灵的人物那里窃取了一把剑。

"Um, what happened to forgetting about today?" replied Shinji. His character, flashing white after taking one too many hits, proceeded to piledrive the current target of his frustrations.
"哎，不是说好今天的事就忘了吗？" 真嗣回应着。他的角色因受到过多攻击而闪烁着白光，紧接着便对眼前的目标发泄了怒火，施以抱摔。

"Well if you really want to forget, I'll just say no more. Just thought you might like to get something off your chest." The genie man had his sword returned to him in a rather unwelcome fashion.
"如果你真想忘记，我就不再提了。只是觉得你可能想吐露心声。"那位精灵男子颇为不悦地取回了自己的剑。

Well, they had both promised to listen when the other wanted to talk. And... well... it wasn't like he wanted to forget about it forever. After all, the biggest problem he had right now was that he had forgotten. "It's fine. You've definitely helped me feel better already anyway," said Shinji. He sighed before continuing. "I somehow managed to have a real conversation with my father. Well... as real as it could get between us I suppose."
他们曾约定，一方想倾诉时，另一方会倾听。而他，也并非真的想将此事永远遗忘。实际上，他目前最大的困扰正是这份遗忘。“没事了。你已经让我感觉好多了，”真嗣说道，叹了口气后接着说：“我居然和我父亲进行了一次真正的交谈。虽然...对我们而言，这已算是尽可能真实的交流了。”

Shinji told Asuka about what his father had said. That he had apparently witnessed his own mother's death and repressed the trauma of it. That his father had destroyed every picture of his own wife out of both grief and a desire to protect the young Shinji's mind.
真嗣向明日香透露了父亲的话，他似乎亲眼见证了母亲的死亡，并因此压抑了内心的创伤。父亲出于悲痛和对真嗣心灵的保护，销毁了所有关于妻子的照片。

"Huh." Asuka raised an eyebrow when he finished. "And here I thought your old man literally couldn't say anything to you besides 'get in the fucking robot'."
哦？" 明日香听罢，眉头一挑。"我还以为你爸除了催你'赶紧进那机器人'，就没别的话了呢。

Shinji gave a short chuckle. It was still a surprise to him that his father was capable of actually speaking to him. But then again, he'd previously had a decade of almost no contact with the man telling him that communication was impossible. One day wasn't enough to completely change that view.
真嗣轻笑一声，依然对父亲能与他对话感到意外。毕竟，过去十年几乎与父亲断绝了联系，让他觉得沟通无望。短短一天，还不足以彻底扭转这一观念。

"What about you?" he eventually asked. "How'd your blind date go?"
你那边怎么样？"他最后问道。"你的相亲顺利吗？

Asuka didn't answer right away, focusing on the boss fight they were up to; a yellow-suited man madly jumping around like he was one of the Israfel twins. When he finally went down for good, Asuka took the time to speak. "Oh he was... boring. He looked alright, I guess, but there was just nothing to him."
明日香并未立即回应，她正全神贯注于眼前的 Boss 战——一个身着黄衣的男子如同伊斯拉斐尔双胞胎般狂乱跳跃。待他最终败北，明日香才缓缓开口：“他啊……挺无趣的。外表尚可，但实在乏善可陈。”

"That's kind of a shame," Shinji replied. "But don't worry, there's definitely somebody out there for you."
这确实有点可惜，" 真嗣回应说，"不过放心，总会有那么一个人在等着你。

A second later he thought he saw Asuka turn her head to look at him, but a quick glance showed that she was entirely focused on the game. A goon took that perfect opportunity to cheap-shot him, and Shinji hurriedly returned his attention to the game as his character flashed white and got some satisfying revenge on the goon.
稍后，他似乎看到明日香转头望向他，但快速一瞥确认她正全神贯注于游戏。一个恶棍趁此良机偷袭了他，真嗣赶紧将注意力转回游戏，他的角色闪着白光，对那恶棍进行了痛快的反击。

Not much more was said after that. They called out enemies and tactics, but soon even that stopped as they drew upon their synchronisation. After that, even rookie gamer Shinji was nigh-untouchable. If his character was about to be stuck in an enemy's combo, Asuka would instantly charge across the screen and lay the offender out. They managed to complete the game without losing any more lives.
此后他们不再多言。起初还呼叫敌人和战术，但不久连这些也停了下来，因为他们开始运用同步技巧。自那以后，即便是新手玩家真嗣也变得几乎无敌。一旦他的角色面临被敌人连招困住的危险，明日香便会迅速横扫屏幕，将对手击溃。他们最终顺利通关，未再损失任何生命。

"Phew." Asuka slumped back into the couch. "Damn, that was good work. Wanna play another game before we start getting dinner ready?"
哎呀。" 明日香瘫倒在沙发上。"真厉害，那活儿干得漂亮。要不要在准备晚饭前再玩一局？

It ended up being three more games before growling stomachs brought a halt to the session.
最终，在肚子饿得咕咕叫迫使游戏暂停前，又进行了三局。

Kaji halted as Misato stumbled, only able to keep her balance thanks to his swift hands. She turned and glared at the perfectly flat surface that had clearly conspired to trip her, then bent down to take her heeled shoes off. She began walking again, and her foot immediately jerked up off the ground, likely due to a sharp stone trying to bury itself in her bare foot.
加持见状停下，明日香一个踉跄，幸亏他及时伸手才没摔倒。她回头瞪了一眼那块平坦得显然是故意绊她的地面，随即弯腰脱掉高跟鞋。再次起步时，她的脚因一块尖石刺痛而迅速抬起。

"Having trouble there?" Kaji ever-so-helpfully asked. "Need me to carry you?"
遇到困难了吗？" 加持热心地问道，"需要我帮忙背你吗？

"So you can put your hands all over my ass?" Misato shot back.
"那你是想把手放在我屁股上吗？" 碇真嗣反问道。

"Didn't seem to mind my hands too much back at the reception."
在接待处时，对方似乎并不太介意我触碰他。

Misato grunted. "Just make sure I get home without kissing concrete. I don't need Ritsuko poking fun at me again."
真嗣嘟囔着：“只要保证我别摔个狗啃泥回家就行。我可不想再被律子取笑了。”

Kaji ripped off a mock salute. "Aye, ma'am!"
加治装模作样地敬了个礼，应声道：“遵命，女士！”

The cool night air certainly helped. It wasn't long before Misato was able to walk mostly unassisted, and at that point they were only a few minutes away from the apartment building.
凉爽的夜风确实起到了作用。没过多久，碇真嗣便能基本独立行走，此时他们距离公寓楼仅剩几分钟的路程。

At her front door, Misato fumbled inside her purse for her keycard. She pulled a card out and tried to swipe it, but the reader beeped angrily at her. A hand reached over her shoulder and plucked the card out of her hand.
在自家门前，Misato 在包里翻找着门禁卡。她抽出一张卡尝试刷卡，然而读卡器却发出了不悦的哔哔声。此时，一只手从她肩后伸来，轻轻地从她手中取走了卡片。

"Wrong one, this is for the kids," Kaji remarked after glancing at the card's details.
"不对，这是给小孩的，" 卡吉扫了一眼卡片信息后说道。

"Well since you have it now, mind checking in on them?" Misato requested as she put her card through the reader. "They might have both had bad days today."
既然你手头有空，不妨去看看他们怎么样？" 碇真嗣提议着，边说边将卡片插入读卡器。"他们今天可能都不太顺心。

"Sure." 当然。

Misato's door opened, and she slurred out a greeting. "'m home."
美里的房门开启，她含糊地说了声：“我回来了。”

"Welcome home," came a soft reply before the door hissed shut again.
“欢迎回家，”一个温柔的声音回应道，紧接着门又嘶嘶地关上了。

Kaji moved over to the next door, but it opened right before he could swipe the card. Misato's strange avian housemate stared at his knees for a moment, before raising its eyes to meet his.
薰走到下一个门前，正要刷卡，门却突然开了。美里家那只奇特的鸟儿先是盯着他的膝盖看了一会儿，随后抬起头来与他对视。

"Wark." 战斗。

"Evening." 晚上好。

Pen-pen glanced behind him, then raised a claw to his beak in the universal 'quiet' gesture before trotting off to Misato's apartment. Kaji quirked an eyebrow before ducking into Shinji and Asuka's apartment.
潘潘回头一瞥，随即举起爪子置于嘴边，做出一个通用的“保持安静”手势，随后快步走向了美里小姐的公寓。加持微微挑眉，接着悄然进入了真嗣和明日香的住处。

One day he'd work out just how the hell that penguin managed to operate electronically locked doors.
终有一天，他会解开谜团：那只企鹅是如何操控电子锁门的。

In the apartment, Kaji could hear talking coming from the lounge room, so he slipped his shoes off and padded stealthily through the kitchen. He quickly deduced that the talking was coming from the television, not the teenagers, and poking his head into the lounge room confirmed it. Some western superhero film was playing; a red and gold android fighting a much larger android.
在公寓内，卡吉听到客厅传来谈话声，便脱下鞋子，蹑手蹑脚地穿过厨房。他迅速意识到声音源自电视而非青少年，探头一看，果不其然。电视上正播放着一部西方超级英雄电影，画面中一个红金色的机器人正与一个更为庞大的机器人激战。

Casting his eyes around the room, Kaji spotted Shinji on the couch, but saw no sign of Asuka. Slowly, carefully, he crept up behind the couch and looked over it. Only his years of training prevented him from making a sound at what he saw.
卡吉环视房间，注意到真嗣坐在沙发上，却不见明日香的踪影。他轻手轻脚地绕到沙发背后，探头窥视。多亏了多年的训练，他才没有在看到眼前景象时发出声响。

Asuka was laying sideways on the couch, her head pillowed on Shinji's lap. Both the boy's hands were on the armrest; likely because he didn't want to risk waking her up. Kaji grinned and silently retreated to the kitchen, where he 'accidentally' bumped one of the chairs before heading back towards the lounge room
明日香横躺在沙发上，头枕在真嗣的腿上，真嗣的双手则放在扶手上，大概是怕动一动就会惊醒她。加持微微一笑，轻手轻脚地退到厨房，故意撞了一下椅子，随后又折回客厅。

"Huh?" Shinji's head swivelled around, but he couldn't turn enough to see behind him. "Pen-pen? Did you forget something?"
嗯？" 真嗣扭头四顾，却怎么也转不到身后。"企鹅？你忘带东西了吗？

"Hey, kiddo," Kaji softly called out. "It's just me. Might have had just a tad too much to drink. Misato definitely has though; she asked me to check in on you two."
嘿，小朋友，" 薰轻声唤道。"是我。可能稍微喝多了些。真嗣肯定是喝过头了；她让我来看看你们俩。

"Oh, hello Mr. Kaji," Shinji replied, his voice barely above a whisper. "I can't really get up to greet you right now. Asuka kind of... um... fell asleep on me."
哦，卡吉先生，您好，" 真嗣低声回应，声音微弱。"我现在不太方便起身迎接您。明日香她...嗯...不小心在我身上睡着了。

"Oh dear." Kaji's grin grew wider. "It must be absolutely awful to be stuck like that."
哎呀，真是的。" 加治笑得更开了。"被困在那样的境地，肯定难受极了。

Shinji's face turned red, to the older male's continued amusement. "Actually it kind of is," he said. "I need to go to the bathroom but I don't want to wake her."
真嗣的脸涨得通红，年长男性见状愈发觉得有趣。“说真的，我确实得去趟洗手间，”他解释道，“但又怕吵醒她。”

"Ah, the age-old conundrum." Kaji leaned on the back of the couch. "Which is the lesser evil: a woman's wrath or a burst bladder?"
啊，这永恒的难题。" 卡吉倚在沙发背上。"哪一种更轻的恶果：是女人的怒火，还是膀胱的崩溃？

Shinji's legs twitched, and his feet crossed themselves. "At this point, Mr Kaji, I would take the wrath, but I'm still nervous about waking her."
真嗣的双腿微微抽动，双脚不自觉地交叉。“卡吉先生，事已至此，我宁愿承受她的怒气，可还是担心会吵醒她。”

"Fair enough." Kaji moved around to the front of the couch, kneeling down next to the two teenagers. "You really don't need to worry much. When she's like this, Asuka's practically dead to the world. You should feel lucky though."
说得有理。"卡吉走到沙发前，跪在两位青少年身旁。"你大可不必过于担心。她这样时，明日香几乎与世隔绝。你该庆幸才是。

Shinji tilted his head. "What do you mean?"
真嗣侧头问道：“你指的是什么？”

Kaji leaned back slightly and sighed at the boy's obliviousness. "Well, apart from the fact a pretty girl is using you as a pillow... Asuka doesn't just fall asleep on anybody. This right here-" he gestured at Asuka's peacefully snoozing head on Shinji's lap, "-is a sure sign that she trusts and feels safe around you."
加治稍稍后仰，对男孩的懵懂无知叹了口气。“除了有个漂亮女孩把你当枕头这一点……明日香可不是随便谁都能让她安心入睡的。她现在这样——”他指向明日香安详地枕在真嗣腿上的头，“——这正是她信任你并感到安心的明证。”

The boy's face got even redder. "O-oh..."
男孩的脸愈发通红，结巴着说："哦..."

"Now then..." Kaji reached out and gently cradled Asuka's head, lifting it just enough for Shinji to slip out and run as quietly as possible to the bathroom. Kaji laid her head back down on the couch, taking a moment to push a strand of hair away from her face.
"那么现在……" 薰伸出手，轻柔地托起明日香的头，让真嗣得以趁机悄无声息地跑向浴室。随后，薰将她的头轻轻放回沙发，并顺手将她脸颊旁的一缕发丝拨开。

The last time Asuka had fallen asleep on somebody, it had been on Kaji himself, quite a few years ago. Before then, even when she was about ready to drop from exhaustion, Asuka refused to be carried to bed; even jolting awake the moment she was picked up, no matter how long Kaji waited. It had taken quite a bit of time before she would allow herself to be carried.
上次明日香在别人身上睡着，已是多年前的事，那人正是加持。即便累得快要倒下，她过去也坚决不肯让人抱到床上，哪怕加持耐心等待，她一被抱起就会立刻惊醒。经过相当长的时间，她才逐渐接受被抱起。

It had also been something of a struggle just to get the headstrong young girl to listen to him. Asuka had always been more interested in doing her own thing, unless it involved piloting an Evangelion. He had practically had to bribe her with simulator time just to get her to behave sometimes. Which caused no end of annoyance from the NERV technicians.
要说服这个倔强的小女孩听从他的话，确实费了不少劲。明日香向来喜欢按自己的方式行事，除非是驾驶福音战士。有时他不得不以模拟器时间为诱饵，才能让她乖乖听话，这让 NERV 的技术人员头疼不已。

"Thank you, Mr. Kaji," said Shinji once he returned to the lounge room.
"谢谢你，卡吉先生，" 碇真嗣回到客厅后说道。

"Mind helping me get Asuka to bed?" Kaji asked. "Take it from me, couches aren't as comfortable to sleep on as they first appear."
能帮我哄明日香上床睡觉吗？" 加持说，"听我的，沙发睡起来可没看起来那么舒服。

"Yeah, sure." 当然可以。

"Good." Kaji grinned internally. Time to see just how much Asuka trusted Shinji. "You pick her up, I'll open the door for you."
好的。"加治暗自窃喜。该看看明日香对真嗣的信任程度了。"你去接她，我来开门。

To his amusement, Shinji's face flushed bright red again as the boy took an involuntary step backwards. Shinji then proceeded to earn several points in Kaji's eyes by quickly recovering and nodding, rather than stammering an excuse as to why he shouldn't do it. He walked over to the couch, knelt down next to Asuka, and ever-so-gently slid his arms underneath her legs and back before gradually standing back up.
令他觉得有趣的是，真嗣的脸再次涨得通红，不由自主地后退了一步。但他很快恢复镇定，点头表示同意，而不是结巴着找借口推脱，这让他在加持眼中加分不少。他走到沙发边，跪在明日香身旁，小心翼翼地将手臂伸到她的腿下和背部，然后慢慢站起身来。

Asuka didn't wake up. 明日香并未醒来。

She continued to not wake up as Shinji practically moved in slow-motion towards the bedroom door, turning sideways to avoid hitting her head on the door frame. Kaji watched from the doorway as Asuka was lowered onto her bed and tucked in. This last minute had proven what he had long hoped for: Asuka finally managed to trust somebody else.
她依旧沉睡不醒，而真嗣几乎是以慢动作缓缓走向卧室门，侧身避开，以防她的头碰到门框。加持站在门口，目睹明日香被轻柔地安置在床上，并细心地盖好被子。这一刻，印证了他一直以来的期盼：明日香终于学会了信任他人。

He stepped aside to let Shinji pass him by, and then quietly slid the door shut. "Nice work," he remarked. "Not a sound, she's still fast asleep."
他侧身让真嗣过去，随后轻轻地关上门。“做得不错，”他低声说，“一点动静都没，她还在沉睡。”

Shinji wiped a hand across his brow like he had had to defuse a bomb. Which, in some ways, was rather accurate.
真嗣用手抹去额头的汗水，仿佛刚完成拆弹任务。某种程度上，这比喻颇为恰当。

"So how have you two been getting along recently?"
你们俩最近相处得如何？

The hand froze in midair as it was about to drop back to his side, and Shinji blinked confusedly at Kaji. "Um... g-good. Why?" he stammered.
手在即将垂回身侧之际僵在半空，真嗣困惑地眨着眼望向卡吉。“呃...挺好...可为什么呢？”他结结巴巴地问道。

"Let's not beat around the bush," said Kaji, leaning against the wall next to the door and folding his arms. "Do you like Asuka?"
别绕圈子了，"卡吉说着，靠在门旁的墙上，双臂抱胸。"你对明日香有好感吗？

There were a couple more blinks as Shinji processed the question, and then his face turned red once more.
真嗣在思考这个问题时又眨了几次眼，接着脸颊再次泛起了红晕。

"Heh, I think that answers that."
呵呵，我觉得这已经解答了那个问题。

Shinji... acted just like Kaji expected. Blushing, stammering, frantic glances around the room and finally burying his face in his hands. Kaji felt slightly guilty at his own bluntness, but there was something that these two needed to start seriously thinking about.
真嗣... 的反应完全在加持的预料之中。他脸红心跳，结结巴巴，慌乱地四处张望，最终将脸埋进双手。加持对自己的直接感到一丝愧疚，但这两个人确实需要开始认真考虑某些问题了。

"W-why are you bringing this up now, Mr. Kaji?" the hideously embarrassed boy asked.
"卡吉先生，您为何现在提起这件事？" 男孩尴尬至极地问道。

"No time like the present," replied Kaji with a nonchalant shrug. "And on that note, have you thought about seeing if she feels the same way?"
现在正是时候，" 加治若无其事地耸肩说道，"顺便问一句，你考虑过探探她是否也有同样的心意吗？

"N-n-no..." Shinji, hands still firmly on his face, stumbled half-blind over to the couch and flopped down on it. "Things are just fine as they are. I don't want to... risk ruining our friendship, especially when she probably doesn't feel the same way."
不，不，不……" 新二双手紧捂着脸，半盲地踉跄着走到沙发旁，一头栽倒。"现在这样就挺好的。我不想冒险破坏我们的友谊，尤其是考虑到她可能并没有同样的感觉。

'Oh you poor oblivious boy.' Kaji sighed despairingly. "You Children have the most dangerous job in the world. Tell me something, Shinji. What frightens you more: being rejected, or you or Asuka dying before you can tell her how you feel?"
'哦，可怜的懵懂孩子啊。' 加持绝望地叹息道。"你们这些孩子承担着世上最危险的任务。告诉我，真嗣，你更害怕什么：是遭到拒绝，还是你或明日香在有机会表达心意之前就离世？"

Shinji's hands slowly dropped from his face, his gaze remaining focused on the floor.
真嗣的双手慢慢从脸上垂下，眼神始终停留在地板上。

"I'm not expecting an answer right now," said Kaji. "But here's a little homework from me. I want you to really think about it. Instead of just assuming the worst, look back at the time you've spent with each other. What you've been through together." He patted Shinji on the shoulder. "It's late, so you should get to bed too. Sleep on it, and make a decision soon. Before the Angels get lucky and ruin it for you."
我现在并不急于得到你的答复，"加治说道，"不过，我给你留个小作业。希望你深入思考一下。别急着往坏处想，回望一下你们彼此相伴的时光，共同经历的点点滴滴。"他轻拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，"夜已深，你也该休息了。好好睡一觉，尽快做出决定。别让使徒有机可乘，毁了这一切。

Shinji nodded stiffly, getting up off the chair and walking almost robotically towards his bedroom. When the door slid shut, Kaji let out a breath, running his hands through his hair. All he could do now was hope that Shinji -or Asuka- would be able to overcome their hesitation and fear of rejection before it was too late. He trudged out of their apartment, intent on making sure Misato made it safely to bed before heading home himself.
真嗣僵硬地点头起身，机械般地走向卧室。门一关上，加持便松了口气，抓了抓头发。他现在只能寄希望于真嗣或明日香能克服犹豫和怕被拒绝的恐惧，以免太迟。他沉重地走出公寓，打算确保美里安全入睡后才回家。

In the darkness of the main bedroom, a single cerulean eye cracked open and stared at the door for several seconds before narrowing slightly.
主卧室一片漆黑中，一只蔚蓝色的眼睛悄然睁开，对着门凝视片刻后，微微眯了起来。

### Chapter 30 Leliel

Misato crept quietly along the tunnel, gun drawn but pointing downward with her index finger resting on the trigger guard. Her heeled shoes were somewhere back along the tunnel, abandoned in favour of stealth. The not-really-just-a-shadow ahead of her stopped in front of a panel next to a pair of massive metal doors, large enough to fit an Evangelion riding on the shoulders of another Evangelion.
碇真嗣静悄悄地沿着隧道潜行，手中握着枪，枪口朝下，食指轻触扳机护圈。为了保持静默，她已将高跟鞋丢弃在隧道某处。前方那个模糊的身影在一块控制面板旁驻足，旁边是一对宏伟的金属门，其尺寸足以让一台 EVA 骑在另一台的肩上。

As her target fiddled with the panel Misato sneaked up behind them, halting just out of lunging range, and brought up her handgun to point it at their back. They stiffened as she loudly toggled the safety.
目标正摆弄控制面板，葛城美里悄然逼近，停在恰到好处的距离，举枪对准其后背。随着她大声拨动保险，对方顿时僵硬。

"Perhaps I should have tried to get you to drink some more," remarked her target without moving. "You certainly seem overly chipper today."
或许我早该劝你多喝一些，"她的目标平静地说，"你今天显得格外兴奋。

"Wouldn't have worked," replied Misato. "I'd have just been suspicious as to why you were so eager for me to reenact our college benders, Kaji."
那样行不通的，" 米萨托回应说。"我反而会怀疑你为何如此迫切要我重温大学时的放纵时光，卡吉。

The scruffy man turned around and shrugged diplomatically. "Ah well, it was worth a shot."
那个衣着不整的男人转过身，巧妙地耸了耸肩。“唉，尝试一下总归没错。”

"So what are you doing down here?" she asked, keeping her gun aimed at his centre of mass. "And if you try to say you got lost on your way to the bathroom I might just have to shoot you out of sheer principle."
你在这儿干嘛呢？" 她质问道，手中的枪稳稳地对准他的躯干。"要是你敢说只是去洗手间迷了路，我可能真会出于原则一枪崩了你。

"Come now, I'd like to think I have a bit more imagination than that," Kaji drawled with a chuckle.
"得了吧，我自认为想象力还不至于这么贫乏，" 卡吉拖着长音，笑着说道。

Despite their history, Kaji was far too relaxed for a man being held at gunpoint for Misato's liking. "How about you just tell me why you're really down here? And while you're at it, you can also tell me who you're really working for. You're certainly not down here on NERV business. Even I don't really have clearance to be down here."
尽管他们之间有历史纠葛，但加治在枪口下的放松态度让美里感到不满。"你不妨直接告诉我你来这里的真正原因，还有你到底为谁效力。你显然不是为了 NERV 的任务下来的。连我都没有权限到这里来。"

Humour twinkled in Kaji's eyes. "Oooh, naughty naughty, Miss Major! But you're correct. Only three people can be down here, and neither of us are among them."
卡吉的眼中闪过一丝幽默。“哦，真调皮啊，少校小姐！不过你说得对。只有三个人能来这里，我们俩都不在其中。”

Misato growled, her trigger finger clenching slightly on the guard.
真嗣低声咆哮，扣在扳机护圈上的手指不由自主地紧了紧。

Kaji relented. "Alright, alright. Look, I'm sorry for not being open with you about my... second job, but it's not exactly something we can chat about by the water cooler."
加治妥协了。“行吧，行吧。你看，我为之前没向你透露我的……另一份工作而道歉，毕竟这事儿真不适合在饮水机旁闲聊。”

"We've had plenty of chances to talk in private," she argued, before glancing around at the walls and spotting a noticeable absence of something important.
"我们本有很多私下交流的机会，"她反驳说，接着环视四周墙壁，察觉到某个关键物品不见了。

"Ah, you've noticed it too, huh?" said Kaji, drawing her attention back to him. "No security cameras down here; the people monitoring them might see something they're not supposed to and have to be... replaced."
啊，你也察觉到了啊？" 加治说着，把她的注意力拉回到自己身上。"这下面没有安装监控摄像头，因为监控的人一旦看到不该看的，可能就得被...处理掉。

"So you futzed about with the systems covering the entrance to this area in order to sneak a peek for yourself, then?"
所以你是调整了覆盖此区域入口的系统，以便自己偷看一眼，对吧？

"Not just for myself. The Japanese Department of Home Affairs would likely be very interested in what's behind door number one, if my theory is correct."
不只是为了我。如果我的推测无误，日本内务省想必会对一号门背后的秘密极为关注。

Misato raised an eyebrow. "And what theory is that?"
碇真嗣微微挑眉，问道："那是什么理论呢？"

Kaji grinned disarmingly, before reaching behind him and pressing a button on the panel. "Let's see if I'm right together, shall we?"
加治迷人地一笑，随即转身按下背后的控制面板上的按钮。“咱们一起验证下我的猜测，如何？”

Warning lights turned the tunnel red as the titanic doors slid ponderously yet almost silently open. Misato shifted her aim to cover the entrance, but what she soon saw as the doors fully opened resulted in her arms dropping to hang slack by her sides. The space beyond was truly gargantuan; likely it could have contained all of Tokyo-3 with room to spare. But it was what was in the middle of the emptiness that caught Misato's eye.
警示灯将隧道映成一片红色，巨门缓缓开启，几乎悄无声息。Misato 本已瞄准入口，但当门完全敞开时，她震惊得手臂不由自主地垂下。门后的空间极为广阔，足以容纳整个东京-3 还有余。然而，真正令 Misato 注目的，是那空旷中央的景象。

A portly white humanoid figure, seemingly larger than even an Evangelion, was hanging from a just-as-large red cross by hands impaled by giant metal bolts. Its legs appeared to have been removed, with only some small strange growths in their place. A purple mask embedded into its face decorated with seven eyes served to top off the weirdness of the creature.
一个肥胖的白色人形生物，体型似乎比福音战士还要庞大，双手被巨大的金属螺栓钉在同样巨大的红色十字架上。它的双腿已不见，只有一些奇怪的小型生长物替代。面部嵌入的紫色面具上装饰着七只眼睛，更添这生物的诡异气息。

"What... the hell is this?!" Misato quietly gasped.
"这到底是什么鬼东西?!" 碇真嗣低声惊呼。

Kaji let out a low whistle. "Guess I was right after all." He slowly stepped in front of Misato and raised a hand as if to present the white giant to her. "Katsuragi, may I introduce to you... the cause of Second Impact and everything that unfolded afterwards: Adam."
薰轻声吹了声口哨，说道："看来我终究是对的。"他缓缓走到碇真嗣面前，举起手，仿佛要将那白色巨人呈现给她。"葛城，请允许我向你介绍……引发第二次冲击及其后所有事件的根源：亚当。"

"Adam?!" Misato spluttered in outrage as memories of being at ground zero for Second Impact flashed through her mind. "Why is NERV hiding this down here?!"
亚当？！" 三佐气愤地脱口而出，脑海中回想起第二次冲击时自己身处震中的情景。"为什么 NERV 要把这东西藏在这里？！

"I don't know," Kaji admitted, his face finally as serious as the situation warranted. "But I intend to find out."
我不清楚，" 卡吉坦言，他的神情终于严肃起来，与当前的严峻形势相称。"但我决心要查个水落石出。

It started as a minuscule blip in the sky; only somebody who both knew exactly where to look and could fly would have had the slightest chance of spotting it, and even then might have dismissed it as a figment of their imagination. The scanning systems of Tokyo-3, on the other hand, had no imagination; they were immediately convinced that something was in the sky above the city, flashing the words 'BLOOD TYPE: ORANGE' on the giant holographic screen in the NERV command centre.
它最初只是天际一抹微小的光斑，唯有既知晓确切方位又能翱翔天际者，方有发现之可能，即便如此，亦或视其为虚幻。而东京-3 的监测系统并无想象力，它们立刻断定城市上空有异物存在，并在 NERV 指挥中心的大型全息屏上闪烁着“血型：橙色”的警示。

"Is it invisible?" Shigeru wondered out loud as the bridge officers looked up at the screen.
"它是不是隐形的？" 志贺润大声自言自语，桥上的军官们纷纷抬头望向屏幕。

"Scans are showing nothing," said Makoto. "Not getting anything with radar, laser or thermal sensors."
真琴说：'扫描结果一片空白，雷达、激光和热感传感器均无任何发现。'

"A glitch in the system?" Misato asked, turning to face Ritsuko. Just as her friend opened her mouth, she hurriedly added. "I mean with the scanners, not the MAGI. I know they don't glitch."
系统出问题了吗？" 美里转向律子问道。见律子正要开口，她赶紧补充："我是指扫描器，不是 MAGI。我知道 MAGI 不会出错。

Mollified, Ritsuko turned her gaze to the screen, just in time to see a large flock of birds sedately fly into view. They made it about two thirds of the way across the screen before the entire flock seemed to panic and spread out, as if to dodge a predator that had appeared in their midst.
情绪稍缓，律子转头看向屏幕，正巧目睹一大群鸟儿悠闲地飞入画面。当它们飞过屏幕约三分之二时，整个鸟群突然陷入恐慌，纷纷散开，似乎是在躲避突然出现的捕食者。

"Not a glitch then," said Ritsuko, tapping her chin. "Those birds obviously sensed something. Focus on the area they avoided."
看来并非故障，" 丽津子边说边轻触下巴。"那些鸟儿显然感应到了什么。重点观察它们避开的区域。

The view panned slightly left and then zoomed in, the birds soon disappearing from sight.
画面稍向左移动并放大，鸟儿不久便从视线中隐去。

"Nothing yet," reported Makoto.
"目前还没有任何情况," 真琴报告道。

"Keep going then," Ritsuko ordered. "Sweep that spot with everything and have the MAGI sift through every byte of data we get back."
继续前进，" 律子下令。"全面扫描该区域，并让 MAGI 仔细筛查我们接收到的每一比特数据。

"Think we're looking at an Angel?" Misato asked after a couple of minutes of staring at the screen. She closed her eyes and huffed. "Oh wait. This is NERV. Of course it's going to be a damn Angel."
琢磨着我们是不是在看一个天使？" 葛城美里盯着屏幕几分钟后问道。她闭上眼，轻叹一声。"哦，等等。这里可是 NERV。不用说，肯定又是那种麻烦的天使。

"Time to call in the pilots?" Ritsuko suggested.
"该叫飞行员了吗？" 里津子提议说。

"Can't hurt," Misato replied. "If it turns out to be nothing, we can just give them a sync test or some simulator training."
没什么坏处，" 碇真嗣回应说，"万一发现没什么问题，我们再安排他们进行同步测试或模拟训练也不迟。

Ritsuko folded her arms, tapping a hand against an elbow. "I think I'd be perfectly happy with a false alarm, even if I have to rush people off their feet to get a sync test ready." She glanced at Maya. "Send the call."
律子交叉双臂，手指轻敲肘部，说道：“哪怕是虚惊一场，我也乐意，就算得催着大家忙得团团转，也得把同步测试准备妥当。”她看向玛雅，吩咐道：“发通知吧。”

"Gonna put money down now," Shigeru remarked. "It ain't a false alarm."
我这就下注，" 志贺说道，"这可不是空穴来风。

"Ever the optimist," Misato replied with a smirk.
"总是那么乐观，" 碇真嗣带着一丝坏笑回应道。

By the time the Children arrived at the command centre, suited up and ready for anything, the anomaly had mutated. There was now a single tiny black dot in the centre of the screen that could have been mistaken for a dead pixel, had it not been for the fact that every camera trained on the spot saw the same thing.
孩子们全副武装到达指挥中心，准备应对一切时，异常现象已发生变异。屏幕中央现出一个微小的黑点，若不是所有对准此处的摄像头都显示同一景象，它几乎会被误认为是屏幕上的坏点。

"So the good news is we can finally see it," said Misato. "Bad news is we still have no idea what it is or what it's doing."
所以好消息是我们终于能看见它了，"米萨托说道。"坏消息是我们依旧不清楚它是什么，也不明白它在做什么。

"What about sending one of us out?" Kensuke suggested. "We could do some close recon and send the data back."
要不我们派个人出去？" 健介提议，"可以进行近距离侦察，然后把数据传回来。

Ritsuko hummed in thought, staring over Maya's shoulder at the lieutenant's monitor. According to the MAGI the anomaly was steadily growing at an almost unnoticeable rate. Initial predictions established that it would grow and cover all of the main Tokyo-3 area in approximately a month.
律子沉吟着，目光越过玛雅的肩头，紧盯着中尉的监控屏幕。MAGI 的数据显示，异常现象正悄然且持续地扩大，几乎不易察觉。初步预测显示，这一现象将在一个月左右覆盖整个东京-3 地区。

"Send me 'n Shinji!" Asuka blurted out, frantically waving a hand to catch the attention of the adults. "We're the most experienced pilots, after all!"
快派真嗣来！" 明日香急切地挥手，试图引起大人们的注意。"毕竟我们是最有经验的驾驶员！

"Well, somebody's enthusiastic about this completely unknown thing," Ritsuko remarked. She glanced at Misato, and a silent conversation seemed to take place between them for the next few seconds. Eventually, they both shrugged.
"看来有人对这件完全未知的事情兴致勃勃呢，" 律子评论道。她瞥了一眼美里，两人间仿佛进行了一场无声的对话，片刻后，她们不约而同地耸了耸肩。

"Fine," said Misato, swiftly raising a hand to cut off Asuka's jubilation. "But you're not going out alone." She paused, glancing between Asuka and Shinji. "Well... you know what I mean. Kensuke, Rei, you two will sortie in Unit-02 and Unit-00 to cover them while they investigate."
行了，" 碇真嗣打断明日香的欢呼，迅速举手示意。"但你不能独自行动。" 她稍作停顿，目光在明日香和真嗣之间来回扫视。"你们懂的。健介，零，你们俩驾驶二号机和零号机出击，为他们调查时提供掩护。

Rei nodded once, and Kensuke looked equal parts excited and apprehensive.
丽点了一下头，健介的表情则混合着兴奋与不安。

"But!" Misato turned a serious look on Asuka and Shinji, reducing the Second Child's enthusiasm. "I want to make this very clear. You are going to do a quick recon, and that is it. If anything happens with the anomaly, you will withdraw, understood? We're not going to have a repeat of Israfel."
但是！" 美里严肃地看着真嗣和明日香，让第二适格者的热情冷却下来。"我必须明确一点。你们这次的任务只是进行快速侦察，一旦发现异常，立即撤退，明白了吗？我们绝不能再犯伊斯拉斐尔那样的错误。

The co-pilots of Unit-01 nodded at the same time and said, "Yes, ma'am."
零号机的副驾驶员们同时点头，齐声回答：“是的，女士。”

"Well with that I can tell you're both on the same page. Now get to your Evas!"
看来你们俩意见相同，那就快去驾驶你们的 Eva 吧！

This trip up the launch catapults wasn't the intense, pressed-into-the-seat ride of previous deployments; it was slower, more cautious, with someone in the command centre ready to reverse the direction of the catapults at a moment's notice. The target was barely even visible to the naked eye, and nothing about it resembled previous Angel encounters. There was no doubt in Shinji's mind that this was an Angel; nothing else simply fit as a reasonable explanation.
这次通过发射弹射器的旅程，并未带来以往那种被紧紧压在座位上的激烈体验；相反，它显得更为缓慢和谨慎，指挥中心有人随时待命，以便在必要时立即逆转弹射器的方向。目标几乎肉眼难辨，与以往遭遇的使徒截然不同。在真嗣心中，毫无疑问，这就是一个使徒；除此之外，别无合理的解释。

The catapult came to an almost gentle halt on the surface outside of Tokyo-3. Unit-01 stepped out of the cradle as the other two Evangelions joined it. All three shared a nod, before Unit-00 collected its weapon and headed for its designated position behind the hills nearby. Unit-02 brought up its Pallet Rifle to its chest like a soldier standing at attention; Unit-01 merely checked the safety on its own weapon before proceeding into the city.
弹射器缓缓停靠在东京-3 外围的地面。初号机从支架中步出，另外两台福音战士随即与之汇合。三机默契地点头后，零号机拿起武器，前往附近山丘后的指定位置待命。二号机将弹药装填枪紧贴胸前，姿态如军姿般挺拔；初号机则简单检查了武器安全，便向城市深处挺进。

It felt somewhat strange, sneaking around the city they were supposed to be defending. The two Evangelions crouch-walked through the streets, keeping their heads below the buildings surrounding them. Periodically, Unit-01 would come to a stop and glance down a street towards the anomaly while Unit-02 would cover their rear. Then a purple hand would pat a red shoulder, and they would continue on their way. Eventually, they reached the point where Unit-01 would be going ahead solo.
潜行于本应守护的城市之中，感觉颇为异样。两台福音战士蹲伏前行，始终让头部低于四周建筑。零号机不时停下，向异常点所在街道投去一瞥，而二号机则紧盯后方。紫色的手轻触红色肩膀，他们便继续前进。最终，抵达了零号机需独自前行的地点。

"Be careful," said Kensuke as Unit-02 gathered up its power cable to keep it from getting tangled up with the other Evangelion's cable, and crouched behind an armoured building, only its head and arm poking out to aim the Pallet Rifle at the anomaly.
"小心点，"健介提醒道，二号机此时正整理电源线，避免与另一台机体的线缆纠缠，然后蹲伏在装甲建筑后，仅露出头部和一只手臂，举起调色板步枪瞄准异常目标。

"I am careful incarnate," Asuka snarked, earning a chuckle from Shinji sitting in front of her. With no more to be said, they cut the comm and focused on the task in front of them. Even this close physically, the strange object looked like a boring black dot painted on the sky. Behind him, Asuka took a deep breath. "Right," she said. "Let's see what we can do about this thing."
我就是谨慎的化身，"飞鸟带着一丝讽刺地说，逗得坐在她前面的真嗣轻笑。无需多言，他们随即切断通讯，全神贯注于眼前的任务。即便近在咫尺，那奇异物体仍似天空中一个乏味的黑点。飞鸟在他身后深吸一口气，"好了，"她说，"我们来看看能对这玩意儿做些什么。

Unit-01 proceeded carefully along the street, weapon constantly trained on the anomaly. Nothing happened as they approached, and nothing continued to happen once they halted only a few dozen meters away.
单元-01 谨慎地沿街前行，武器一直瞄准着异常目标。他们接近时未发生任何情况，停下后几十米外也未见异常。

"Close enough?" Asuka asked of the command centre.
"这样够近了吗？" 明日香询问指挥中心。

"Fine for our purposes," replied Ritsuko. "Sensor link established, initiating broad spectrum sweep. Hold your position for a couple minutes."
对我们来说已经足够了，"立津子回应道。"传感器已连接，现在开始全频谱扫描。请原地待命几分钟。

And just like that, the situation felt so much more tense to Shinji. Here they were, practically right underneath the definitely-an-Angel, doing nothing but staring up at it while other people, safe in their underground bunker, poked it with a stick.
就这样，真嗣感到局势愈发紧张。他们几乎就在那明显是天使的生物正下方，除了抬头凝视别无动作，而其他人则在地下掩体中，用棍子挑逗它。

"Easy, Shinji," Asuka quietly cautioned, clearly having felt his discomfort through their link.
"放松点，真嗣，" 明日香轻声提醒，显然是通过他们之间的联系感受到了他的不适。

"S-sorry," he mumbled, glad she couldn't see his face. He began to slowly inhale and exhale; the LCL oxygenated their bodies and eliminated the physiological need to breathe, but there was still a psychological desire, to try and purge the nervousness from his system.
"抱歉，"他低声说道，庆幸她看不到他的表情。他开始缓缓地深呼吸，虽然 LCL 已经为他们的身体提供了充足的氧气，生理上无需呼吸，但心理上仍渴望通过呼吸来缓解紧张情绪。

"Okay, we're done," came Ritsuko's voice, almost sending Shinji flying out of his seat in surprise and earning a snort of amusement from his co-pilot. "Not as much new data as I would like, but I'll take what I can get."
好了，任务完成，"丽子的声音响起，差点让真嗣从座位上惊跳起来，旁边的副驾驶忍不住嗤笑。"虽然新数据不多，但总比没有强。

"Time to withdraw," Misato ordered.
"撤退的时候到了，"Misato 下令。

"Right," Shinji and Asuka said together. He relaxed slightly as Unit-01 turned around, heading back towards Kensuke and Unit-02.
"对，" 真嗣和明日香同时说道。随着初号机转身向健介和二号机方向返回，他略微松了一口气。

"...Huh," said Asuka. "Is it getting overcast?"
哎呀，" 明日香说，"是不是要变天了？

They looked up, just as the comm lit up with shouts of alarm.
他们抬头之际，通讯器突然亮起，传来阵阵惊慌的呼声。

"Pattern Blue! It's an Angel!"
蓝色图案！那是天使！

"Permission to engage!" 允许进行！

"Get out of there, now!"
快点离开那里！

All that went ignored by Shinji and Asuka, transfixed as they were on the giant black and white orb floating directly above them.
真嗣和明日香对周围的一切浑然不觉，他们的目光完全被头顶上那颗巨大的黑白球体所吸引。

"MOVE!" 快走！

Misato's shout jerked Unit-01's pilots out of their stupor and the Evangelion began to run... only to instantly stop and almost fall over.
美里的喊声让初号机的驾驶员们从恍惚中猛然惊醒，福音战士刚一跑起来就突然停住，差点摔倒。

"What the hell?!" Shinji exclaimed in shock. "Where did this... tar stuff come from?!"
这到底是怎么回事？！" 真嗣震惊地喊道。"这种...这种沥青似的东西是从哪儿冒出来的？！

A veritable lake of inky blackness covered the area around them, nearby buildings starting to sink like it was quicksand. A cascade of German curses flew from Asuka's mouth as she and Shinji struggled to shift Unit-01's feet out of it, but Shinji couldn't even feel his own feet anymore. Ahead of them, Unit-02 stepped out from behind cover and opened fire, emptying the Pallet Rifle's magazine into the Angel. Unit-00 also began shooting, but the bullets merely passed harmlessly through the orb like it wasn't there.
四周被一片深邃的墨黑湖泊所覆盖，附近的建筑仿佛陷入流沙般逐渐下沉。阿苏卡忍不住用德语咒骂连连，她和真嗣竭力想让初号机摆脱束缚，然而真嗣已经感觉不到自己的双脚。前方，二号机从掩体后现身，对准使徒猛烈开火，弹匣中的子弹倾泻而出。同时，零号机也加入了射击，但子弹却如同穿透虚空，对那球体毫无影响。

"D-damnit!" D-真糟糕！

Unit-02 dropped its weapon and charged forward, skidding to a halt as it neared the blackness trapping Unit-01. It grabbed onto its stricken comrade's power cable and began to tug. Unit-01 was now up to its waist and still sinking.
单元-02 抛下武器，疾冲向前，在接近困住单元-01 的黑暗区域时猛地停住。它抓住了受困同伴的电源线，开始用力拖拽。此时，单元-01 已陷入至腰际，仍在不断下沉。

"Don't pull too hard!" Asuka exclaimed. "The socket isn't rated for hauling Evas!"
别太用力拉！" 明日香急忙提醒，"这插座承受不住 Eva 的拖拽！

"Well I'm fresh out of rope to throw for you!" Kensuke angrily retorted as Unit-02 began to back up the street, pulling the cable taut.
"哼，我可没绳子再扔给你了！" 健介怒气冲冲地回敬，同时二号机沿着街道后撤，将电缆绷得紧紧的。

Panic started to set in as Shinji felt the tugging on his back. He tried to kick the Evangelion's legs, but with no feeling below his hips, he could barely even tell if his own legs were doing anything.
恐慌逐渐在真嗣心中蔓延，他感受到背部的拉扯。尽管试图踢动初号机的双腿，但腰部以下失去知觉，他几乎无法确定自己的双腿是否在动。

"Goddamnit, let us go!" Asuka roared. Unit-01 pointed its weapon down at the blackness and fired, to no visible effect. The command centre was still in an uproar, but the comm link was starting to hiss with static.
"该死，我们快走！" 明日香怒吼着。零号机将武器对准下方的黑暗开火，却毫无效果。指挥中心依旧嘈杂不堪，通讯链接也开始夹杂着静电声。

"We're losing connection with Unit-01! Ejection commands aren't getting through!"
我们与 01 单元失去联系了！弹射指令无法传达过去！

And then Unit-01's power socket cracked apart, the end of the cable flying towards Unit-02. Thinking quickly, Kensuke grabbed the end and threw it back to Unit-01, who latched on with both hands.
紧接着，初号机的电源插座突然破裂，电缆头直飞向二号机。健介反应敏捷，一把抓住电缆头，迅速抛还给初号机，后者随即用双手牢牢抓住。

"Get us out of here! Please!" Shinji fearfully yelled.
"带我们离开这儿！求你了！" 真嗣惊恐地喊道。

"Calm down Shinji, you're damaging our sync!" Asuka was trying to sound in control, but Shinji could definitely feel her dread. Which only served to increase his own terror as the sensation of nothingness crept up to his armpits.
"冷静点，真嗣，你在破坏我们的同步率！"明日香努力保持镇定，但真嗣能清晰地感觉到她的不安。这更加剧了他自己的恐惧，那种空虚感正逐渐侵袭至他的腋下。

Unit-00 arrived and quickly gathered up the cable behind Unit-02, wrapping it several times around an arm before leaning backwards, feet digging into the road surface. Both rescuers were slowly being pulled forward towards the blackness, no matter how hard they pulled.
单元 00 抵达现场后，迅速拾起单元 02 背后的电缆，将其反复缠绕在手臂上，身体后仰，双脚紧抓路面。两位救援者尽管奋力抵抗，仍逐渐被拖向那片黑暗。

Asuka, seeing that the rescue wasn't working, cursed even more, then shouted, "Just let us go you two, before you get trapped as well!"
明日香见救援无果，愈发咒骂，接着高声呼喊：“你们俩快放我们走，别自己也陷进来了！”

At almost the same time, Misato gave what was likely the hardest order she'd ever had to give. "Rei! Kensuke! Retreat now!"
几乎同时，葛城美里下达了或许是她迄今为止最艰难的命令：“绫波！健二！马上撤退！”

"Are you joking?!" 你是在开玩笑吧?!

"They are still trapped!"
他们依旧被困！

While their teammates gave the expected cries of disapproval, Shinji turned a betrayed look on Asuka. "What are you saying?!" he asked in horror.
队友们纷纷发出预期的反对声，而真嗣则向明日香投去了一个充满背叛感的眼神，惊恐地问道：“你这是什么意思？！”

"It's no good if all of us get stuck in here." Asuka grimly replied. "Fall back and work on a plan to rescue us. We'll be fine, no Angel's gonna digest us without a fight!"
我们都困在这里可不是办法。" 明日香严肃地回应，"你们先撤，制定营救方案。我们能撑住，使徒想吞噬我们，没那么容易！

Unit-00 stopped hauling on the cable as Rei hit them with a serious look through the staticky comm window. "We will come for you," she stated with such surety that Shinji was positive Rei would leap into the void if that was what it took to rescue them.
Unit-00 松开了缆绳，绫波透过布满静电的通讯窗口，用严肃的眼神凝视着他们，坚定地说：“我们会来救你。”真嗣深信，若救援需跃入虚空，绫波定会毫不犹豫。

"Heh, I know you will, Wondergirl," Asuka darkly laughed. She held out a fist, thumb pointing upwards.
"呵呵，我就知道你会这样，神奇女孩，" 明日香带着一丝阴郁的笑意说道。她伸出拳头，拇指向上翘起。

Unit-01 mimicked the gesture as it sank into the abyss.
单元 01 模仿了这一动作，随即沉入无底深渊。

XXX

Feeling returned to Shinji's body as suddenly as a slammed door, but that didn't make him feel any better. He groaned, and heard a mirrored groan from behind him.
真嗣的身体突然恢复了知觉，犹如猛然关闭的门扉，然而这并未让他感到丝毫舒适。他发出一声呻吟，身后也传来了相似的呻吟声。

"Well we're still alive," Asuka remarked as he shifted in his seat to face her. "Although I wonder how long we have until we get... digested or whatever."
还好，我们还活着，" 飞鸟说着，调整了一下坐姿，面向她。"只是不知道我们还能坚持多久，不被...消化掉之类的。

She brought up a holographic keyboard and screen, and began to rapidly type commands into it. "Wherever we are, there's no oxygen outside the Eva so we're stuck in here. Speaking of which... better shut down everything non-essential."
她启动了全息键盘和屏幕，快速输入着指令。“不管我们现在在哪，伊娃号外没有氧气，我们只能待在这里。对了……还是把非必需的设备都关掉吧。”

Background noises that Shinji had instinctively tuned out over months of piloting were suddenly too loud in their absence. "So... how long do we have?" he nervously asked.
数月驾驶中已习惯性忽略的背景噪音，此刻因消失而显得格外响亮。“那……我们还有多久？”真嗣不安地询问。

Asuka thought for a moment, fingers still tapping away at the keyboard. "Well if nothing happens, at full power the entry plugs are rated for sixteen hours of life support with everything else shut down. We did lose the power cable a bit beforehand so we might... have... less what the fuck?!"
明日香沉思片刻，手指依旧在键盘上敲打着。“如果一切正常，全功率运行时，插入栓的生命维持系统能支持十六小时，其他设备均已关闭。不过，我们之前确实断了电源线，所以可能……时间会……更短，搞什么鬼？！”

Shinji shied away from her sudden anger. "What? What is it?"
真嗣被她突如其来的怒气吓得退缩了。"怎么了？出什么事了？"

Asuka ignored him for a moment as she practically slammed her fingers on the keyboard, her scowl deepening as the seconds ticked by. Finally, she balled a hand into a fist and smacked it into the side of the entry plug. "Scheiße! Wir haben nur acht Stunden Lebenserhaltung, nicht sechzehn, zum Teufel! Was soll der Scheiß!?"
明日香暂时没理他，手指几乎是在键盘上猛敲，随着时间流逝，她的眉头越皱越紧。最后，她攥紧拳头，狠狠地砸在插入栓的一侧。“该死！我们只有八小时的维生时间，不是十六小时，真是见鬼了！这到底是什么破事！？”

In his surprise at the outburst, it took Shinji a moment to mentally translate, but then the surprise turned into fear. "W-what?! Only half the life support we're supposed to have? Is it... because there's two of us in one plug?"
面对突如其来的情况，真嗣一时愣住了，但很快惊愕变成了恐惧。"什么？！生命维持系统只有正常的一半？难道是因为我们两个人挤在一个驾驶舱里？"

Asuka took a deep breath, running a gloved hand down her face. "It can't be just that. NERV would surely have upgraded the life support system when building the dual sync plug." She blinked, eyes widening and hand covering her mouth as her head turned towards Shinji. "...Right?"
明日香深吸一口气，戴着手套的手拂过脸颊。“事情不会这么简单。建造双同步插头时，NERV 肯定升级了生命维持系统。”她眨眼间，目光一闪，手捂住嘴，转头看向真嗣。“……对吧？”

Her voice was almost pleading now.
她的声音此刻几乎带着恳求的意味。

"...Right?!" ...对吧？

"Damnit!" 真糟糕！

Rei glanced over at Aida as the boy smacked a fist against the corridor wall, leaving a smear of LCL behind. The two of them had just returned from their disastrous mission, and had been asked to immediately report to Major Katsuragi in the command centre. There was no time to waste on rest and cleanup; a plan had to be formulated as soon as possible.
绫看向相田，只见他一拳砸在走廊墙壁上，留下了一道 LCL 的痕迹。两人刚从那场灾难性的任务中返回，便被要求立刻向葛城美里少校汇报，赶往指挥中心。此刻，休息和清理都成了奢侈，必须争分夺秒制定下一步计划。

"Why did she make us retreat like that?!" he demanded. "We could have still saved them!"
她为何命令我们撤退？" 他质问道，"我们明明还能救他们！

"That is incorrect," Rei replied. "Whatever was pulling Unit-01 in had seemingly infinite force behind it. The strength of our two Evangelions was not enough to even slow it down. If we had continued to attempt a rescue, we would have been captured as well."
那是不对的，" 丽回答说。"无论是什么在拖拽初号机，它似乎拥有无穷的力量。我们两台 EVA 的力量根本无法减缓它的行动。如果我们继续尝试救援，我们自己也会被卷入其中。

Aida hissed in anger. "How can you be so nonchalant?" he asked. "Our friends are trapped... or they might even be dead!"
阿依达怒气冲冲地嘶声道：“你怎么能如此漠不关心？我们的朋友被困，甚至可能已经遇难！”

Rei frowned. There was no doubt in Rei's mind that Shinji and Asuka were still alive, but she could not understand just how she was so sure. "Do not mistake my calmness for disregard," she reproachfully said. "I am most upset that Shinji and Asuka are currently trapped, but getting angry and hitting things will not solve the problem."
绫波皱着眉头，内心坚定地相信碇真嗣和明日香依然安然无恙，只是她自己也不明白这份确信从何而来。“别以为我保持冷静就是不在乎，”她带着责备的口吻说，“我其实非常忧心碇真嗣和明日香被困的现状，但发怒和砸东西解决不了问题。”

Taking a deep breath, Aida closed his eyes and exhaled. His other hand, carrying his glasses, came up to put them on his face. "Okay, yeah, you're right," he muttered. "And a soldier shouldn't get mad about things out of his control."
深吸一口气后，艾达闭上双眼，慢慢呼气。他另一只手拿着眼镜，将其戴在脸上。“嗯，你说得对，”他喃喃自语。“士兵确实不该对无法掌控的事情发怒。”

Rei's head tilted forward in a slight nod of approval.
礼轻轻点头，表示赞同。

The Angel had been truly different from its predecessors. One moment it had been an almost insignificant blip in her sights, and the next it had expanded to darken an entire block of Tokyo-3 directly above Unit-01. Every shot fired had passed through it as if it wasn't even there with not so much as a ripple across its surface, and the void it had opened up swallowed everything in its radius without distinction.
那只天使与先前的敌人迥然不同。起初，它在她视野里仅是一个不起眼的小点，转瞬间却扩张成形，笼罩了东京-3 区上方的一大片区域，正对着初号机。射向它的每一发子弹都仿佛穿过了虚无，其表面未曾激起半点波纹，而它所形成的空洞无情地吞噬了周围的一切。

"None of our training could have possibly prepared us for this," said Rei.
"我们的任何训练都不可能让我们为这种情况做好准备，"雷说道。

"Yeah." Aida gave a humourless chuckle. "It's like preparing for a sword fight your whole life, and on the day your opponent shows up with a Gatling gun."
没错。" 艾达干笑一声，毫无幽默可言。"就好比你一生都在为剑术决斗做准备，到了决战之日，对手却扛着加特林机枪来了。

The command centre was full of grim faces, but none of them could hold a candle to Misato's sullen demeanour.
指挥中心内众人面色凝重，却无一能与碇真嗣的阴郁神情相比。

"No contact with the shelter underneath the Angel?" she asked as Rei and Aida walked in.
"你们没有联系天使下方的庇护所吗？" 她问道，此时 Rei 和 Aida 正走进来。

"None, I'm afraid," replied Lieutenant Hyuga. "But the thickness of the Angel is only three nanometers. The ground underneath it still seems intact from what we can make out, so all we can do is hope the same is true for the shelter."
恐怕没有消息，" 日向副官回答说，"不过使徒的厚度只有三纳米。从目前观察来看，它下方的地面似乎未受影响，我们只能寄希望于避难所同样安然无恙。

"Wait, thickness of the Angel?" asked Aida.
"等等，你是指天使的厚度吗？" 艾达疑惑地问。

Misato turned to greet them. "Ah, you're here. As it turns out, that thing-" she pointed at the floating orb on the main viewscreen, "-is not actually the Angel itself. There's some really weird physics stuff going on, but basically the sphere is just the shadow that the Angel, which is actually the void underneath it, casts in our dimension."
真嗣转身迎接他们。"啊，你们到了。原来，那个东西——"她指着主屏幕上悬浮的球体说，"——其实并非使徒本体。这里面有些很奇特的物理现象，简而言之，那个球体只是使徒，即其下方虚空，在我们维度中的投影。"

Aida paused to take this all in."So... Shinji and Asuka were pulled into another dimension? Not... eaten or whatever?"
阿依达停下脚步，试图消化这一切。"也就是说... 真嗣和明日香是被卷入了另一个维度？而不是...被吞噬之类的？"

"Yes," said Doctor Akagi. "But that's all we currently know, since despite having a six-hundred eighty meter hole to look into, we can't get any readings out of it."
阿基医生说：'是的，但目前我们所知仅限于此。虽然有一个六百八十米深的洞可供研究，但我们无法从中得到任何读数。'

"Could you not lower a probe in, like at Mount Asama?" suggested Rei, staring up at the screen. Out of the corner of her eye, Aida gave her a look of slight puzzlement, reminding her that he hadn't been brought into NERV at that point. Perhaps later, once all this was over and her friends were safe, she would bring him up to speed on the previous Angel attacks.
"你能不能像在浅间山那样，把探测器放下去呢？" 丽抬头望着屏幕提议道。眼角余光中，相田略显困惑地看了她一眼，这让她意识到他那时还未加入 NERV。或许等这一切风波平息，朋友们都安然无恙后，她会向他详细介绍之前遭遇的使徒攻击。

Doctor Akagi sighed in exasperation. "I'd absolutely love to try that. But we don't have any, and it would take more time than we have to build one from scratch."
阿卡吉医生无奈地叹了口气。“我真的很想试试那个，可惜我们手头没有，而且从头开始制作一个，时间上我们也来不及。”

"We are working against a time limit then?"
我们是在赶时间吗？

"Correct. If they were smart and immediately shut down everything but life support, Shinji and Asuka should have around sixteen hours before..." Doctor Akagi looked away.
"没错。若他们明智地立即关闭了除生命维持系统外的所有设备，真嗣和明日香应该还有大约十六小时……" 赤木博士转开了视线。

"Before all we'd get back is a couple of cold bodies," Misato darkly finished, clenching a fist at her side.
"在我们只能带回几具冰冷尸体之前，" 碇真嗣阴沉地说完，紧握拳头站在一旁。

TIME REMAINING: 07:42:33 剩余时间：7 小时 42 分 33 秒

Shinji and Asuka were slumped in their seats, still stunned at the revelation. Even after double- and triple-checking the readouts, the truth was clear: whatever error had been made had left them with only half the rated survival time that they were supposed to have.
碇真嗣和明日香瘫坐在座位上，依旧对这一发现感到震惊。即便反复核查数据，事实也已明了：无论出了何种差错，他们所剩的生存时间仅是预期的一半。

The holographic computer had been deactivated, leaving the entry plug almost completely dark. Only the dimmest of red emergency lighting gave the shadows some definition.
全息电脑已停机，导致插入栓内几乎陷入黑暗。仅剩的暗淡红色应急灯为周围的阴影勾勒出模糊的轮廓。

Shinji's mind whirled chaotically, madcap plans to break Unit-01 out intermingling with thoughts of their friends attempting the same, in between pessimistic predictions about their chances of survival.
真嗣脑海中思绪纷乱，疯狂构想着如何解救初号机，其间穿插着对朋友们同样尝试的想象，以及对生存可能性的悲观预感。

"I'm... going to adjust a couple things," Asuka quietly stated. "See if I can buy us more time."
我...准备调整几项设置，" 明日香低声说，"试试看能否为我们争取到更多时间。

The entry plug lit up again as the holographic computer returned. "...Like what?" asked Shinji.
插入栓再次亮起，全息计算机重新启动。“...像什么？”真嗣问道。

"All I can really do is adjust the temperature," she admitted. "I don't have access to much in the way of higher order commands or I could try and do more; maybe even arrange to render us unconscious to extend the life support by quite a bit. The heating is going to give out eventually, in fact it tends to be the first thing to fail so that life support can go as long as possible, but if I turn it down a bit now it should last a little longer. I can cope if I knock the temperature down a couple degrees, what about you?"
我真正能做的，只是调整温度而已，"她坦言，"我没有权限使用更高级别的命令，否则或许能采取更多措施；甚至可能设法让我们进入昏迷状态，以大幅延长生命维持系统的运行时间。供暖系统最终会停止工作，通常它是最先失效的，以便生命维持系统尽可能持久，但如果我现在稍微调低温度，它应该能多撑一会儿。我降低几度还能适应，你怎么样？

Shinji quietly exhaled. "Do what you have to, Asuka. I'll manage."
碇真嗣轻轻地呼了口气。“明日香，你尽管去做你该做的事，我会想办法的。”

"...Okay." ...好的。

A slight prickling of Shinji's skin a minute later told him that Asuka had made the change, and he resisted the urge to wrap his arms around his torso. He said he would manage, and he was not about to look like a weakling in front of Asuka. Especially since he could feel her trying her best to remain calm and rational.
一分钟后，真嗣感觉到皮肤上轻微的刺痛，意识到明日香已经做出了改变。他抑制住想要抱紧自己的冲动，毕竟他曾表示自己能够应对，不想在明日香面前显得软弱。尤其是他能感觉到她正竭力保持冷静和理性。

And that in itself was a worrying thought. The two of them weren't supposed to spend too long in an entry plug together for fear of their minds melding too much. But Unit-01 was powered down, and he was still getting flickers of emotion from Asuka.
这个念头本身就令人不安。他们本不该在插入栓内共处过久，以防心智过度交融。然而，初号机已停机，他仍能感受到明日香情感的微弱波动。

Still, he wouldn't wish a prison like this on anybody who was trapped by themselves. He would gladly risk whatever mental contamination could occur if it meant Asuka didn't suffer alone.
即便如此，他也不愿任何人陷入这样的自我囚禁。为了不让明日香独自承受痛苦，他甘愿面对任何可能的精神侵蚀。

"So what's the plan then?" asked Kensuke. "Surely you have something we can at least attempt."
那么，计划是什么？" 健介追问，"你总得有我们可以尝试的方案吧。

"Nothing yet," replied Doctor Akagi. "But it's been less than an hour. If either of you have any ideas at all, by all means let us know. We're open to almost anything."
目前还没有进展，"阿基医生回应说，"不过才过去不到一小时。如果你们有任何想法，请尽管提出来。我们愿意考虑任何可能性。

"In the meantime," said Misato. "Go freshen up, and have something to eat. Maybe have a quick nap if possible; there's bunkrooms near the cages. You're both on standby for the foreseeable future."
米萨托说：“这段时间，你们先去洗漱一下，吃点东西。有机会的话，就在附近的休息室小憩片刻。接下来你们都要随时待命。”

"Yes ma'am," said the two teenagers; not quite in sync like Shinji and Asuka could manage, but relatively close. Aida also threw in a salute for good measure.
"是的，女士，"两位少年异口同声地说，虽不及真嗣和明日香那般默契，却也相差无几。艾达还特意敬了个礼以示敬意。

Misato nodded at them and turned her attention back to the viewscreen as they left the command centre.
真嗣向他们点头示意后，便将目光重新投向显示屏，随后离开了指挥中心。

Outside in the corridor, Kensuke sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Don't suppose you've got a brilliant, foolproof plan to rescue our friends yet, do you? Because I'm fresh out."
走廊外，健介叹息着，伸手梳理了一下头发。“你该不会已经想出了一个绝妙且万无一失的救援计划吧？我可是束手无策了。”

Rei slowly shook her head. "I have been attempting to think of a plan ever since they were taken. Nothing has yet become solid." What she didn't mention was how most of her thoughts kept getting interrupted by the memory of Shinji's face, frozen in an expression of abject fear. She sharply exhaled, attempting once more to banish the mental image, and headed off for the female change room while Aida headed for the male side.
绫慢慢地摇了摇头。“自从他们被抓走后，我一直在努力构思对策，但至今仍未有实质性的进展。”她未曾提及，自己的思绪屡屡被真嗣那张凝固在极度恐惧中的面容所干扰。她深吸一口气，再次试图将这幅画面从脑海中抹去，随后走向女更衣室，而相田则前往男更衣室。

She then proceeded to remove her plugsuit and take the longest shower she had ever had.
随后，她脱掉插入栓服，享受了有生以来最漫长的一次沐浴。

Twelve minutes later she emerged from a cloud of steam, wrapped in a towel. The staff had done their usual swift and discreet job, leaving a fresh plastic-wrapped plugsuit sitting on a bench in the main area of the changing room. Rei donned the plugsuit, discarding the towel in the hamper, and walked out into the corridor. The faint sound of water from next door told her that Aida was still showering, so she headed off to the cafeteria alone.
十二分钟后，她从蒸汽缭绕中现身，身上裹着一条毛巾。工作人员一如既往地迅速且谨慎，将一件崭新的塑料包装的插入栓服放置在更衣室主区的长凳上。绫波穿上插入栓服，将毛巾丢入篮中，随即步出走廊。隔壁隐约传来的水声表明，相田仍在沐浴，于是她独自前往食堂。

There, the head chef greeted her in the dining area with a serious nod. "Major Katsuragi called ahead. Told us to give you something to last for a while. We're preparing something right now, it'll just be a few more minutes."
在用餐区，主厨严肃地向她点头致意。“葛城少校已经提前通知了，吩咐我们为你准备一些耐饥的食物。我们正在做，稍等片刻即可。”

Rei nodded. "Thank you," was her simple reply.
瑞点头致谢。"谢谢你。"她简短地回应道。

The chef returned the nod, and went back to the kitchen, while Rei sat at a table and waited patiently. Aida soon showed up, face still red from the shower, and sat across from her. Just as the head chef said, their meals soon arrived, and they dug in.
厨师点头示意后便返回厨房，Rei 则坐在桌旁耐心等候。不久，Aida 带着刚洗完澡的红润脸颊出现，坐在她对面。正如主厨所言，餐点很快上桌，两人随即开动。

Once their plates were empty, the head chef returned carrying a small plastic bag. "I've also got some energy bars in case you get hungry while on standby," he said, showing them one of the bars in question.
盘子空了后，主厨拿着一个小塑料袋回来了。“我还带了些能量棒，以防你们待命时饿了，”他边说边展示了一根能量棒。

"That is appreciated, but unnecessary," said Rei.
雷说：‘这虽然值得赞赏，但并非必要。’

"Ayanami," Aida cut in, giving her a serious look. "It's always a good idea to accept extra food. You never know when supply lines will be cut."
绫波，" 艾达打断她，神情严肃。"多拿些食物总是明智的。补给线随时可能被切断，你得有备无患。

Puzzlement crossed Rei's face. They weren't even going to be outside of Tokyo-3. "...I hardly think that will be a problem in this situation."
绫的脸上掠过一丝困惑。他们甚至不会走出东京-3 的范围。“……在这种情况下，我觉得这应该不是问题。”

"Perhaps, but I like to be prepared for every eventuality." Aida looked up at the chef. "Thank you very much," he said as he accepted the bag. The chef gave a smile and an airy farewell wave as he walked back to the kitchen with their plates.
"可能吧，不过我喜欢为各种情况做好准备。" 艾达抬头望向厨师。"非常感谢，" 他接过袋子时说道。厨师微笑着，轻松地挥手告别，随后带着他们的盘子返回厨房。

"Let me guess," said Rei once they left the cafeteria. "We should try to get some sleep now, because 'you never know'?"
让我猜猜，" Rei 离开食堂后说道，"我们现在应该抓紧时间休息，毕竟'世事难料'嘛。

The sides of Kensuke's mouth turned upwards. "Heh, you read my mind, Ayanami. Just like food, rest can sometimes be hard to come by, so grab what you can."
健介嘴角微微上扬，说道：“嘿，绫波，你真是懂我。休息这东西，有时候跟食物一样难得，能抓住就别放过。”

"Very well." 很好。

With that said, the two pilots headed off to the bunkrooms. Just like the change rooms, they were split up for male and female personnel. Aida bid Rei goodnight, despite it being the middle of the day, and walked into the male room.
尽管是正午时分，艾达还是向零道了声晚安，随后走进了男性休息室。与更衣室一样，休息室也按性别分设。

In the female room, Rei laid down and waited for sleep to come. To her mild surprise, she wasn't able to fall asleep as quickly as usual. Normally, she could practically will herself to sleep; a useful trait when constantly stuck in hospital. But this time, sleep was eluding her, and she had a reasonably good guess as to why.
在女子房间内，Rei 躺下静候睡意。出乎她意料的是，这次她并未如往常般迅速入眠。通常，她几乎能靠意志力让自己入睡，这在频繁住院时颇为有用。然而此刻，睡意却迟迟不来，她心中对此原因已有了几分猜测。

Shinji and Asuka, still trapped within the Angel. And despite Doctor Akagi claiming that they would be alright for sixteen hours, Rei felt a strange sense of urgency, as if they should be doing everything possible right now. She couldn't work out if it was something that had been overlooked, or if she was just desperate to do something besides waiting.
真嗣与明日香依旧被困于使徒之中。尽管赤木博士保证他们十六小时内安全无虞，绫波丽却感到一股难以言喻的紧迫，似乎此刻就应竭尽全力。她不确定这是否源于某个被忽略的细节，还是她内心渴望有所作为，而非只是静待。

It was strange just what two people had managed to do to her worldview. Before Shinji and Asuka had arrived in her life, Rei had been content to simply coast along, waiting for the time when the Commander would need her to perform the task she had been created for. There had been little point in interacting with people at school, where she had heard the whispers behind her back such as the 'Ice Queen' nickname somebody had seen fit to give her.
正是真嗣和明日香，奇妙地改变了她的世界观。在他们出现之前，绫波一直满足于随波逐流，静待指挥官召唤她履行被创造的使命。在学校，与人交往似乎并无意义，她常听到背后的窃窃私语，比如有人给她贴上的“冰山女王”标签。

But then Shinji and Asuka had decided to greet her at school, and that was where things had taken a turn for the odd; perhaps also for the better. Rei had noticed Shinji's lack of light when they had met in Unit-01's cage, but she hadn't been in any position to do anything about what could have been a hallucination. This time, however, she could act against what she had initially taken to be a SEELE agent, and only Asuka's presence had prevented her from immediately unfurling her AT-Field and smearing Shinji across the grass.
然而，真嗣和明日香决定在学校迎接她，事情因此变得有些诡异，或许也是向好的方向转变。丽曾在零号机的驾驶舱注意到真嗣眼中的光芒消失，但当时她无法对可能的幻觉做出反应。这次不同，她能对抗起初以为是 SEELE 特工的误解，若非明日香在场，她可能已经立刻展开 AT 力场，将真嗣击倒在草地上。

Those few seconds of hesitation had saved Shinji's life. Or perhaps it was Asuka demanding her attention, and her strangeness, that had kept him alive. They had taken an interest in her ability to see people's light, but had simply accepted it instead of ostracising her as she had been worried about for a brief moment. And in turn, she had accepted their unique circumstances.
那短暂的犹豫救了真嗣一命。或许是明日香的坚持和她的与众不同，让他得以存活。他们对她的特殊能力——能看见人们内心的光芒感到好奇，并未如她曾担忧的那样排斥她，而是坦然接受。同样，她也接受了他们各自的特殊情况。

In the darkness of the bunkroom, Rei gave a quiet huff as she rolled over on the bed. Thinking of Shinji and Asuka in a better time seemed to be easing her mind. Perhaps now she could finally fall asl-
在昏暗的寝室里，绫波轻声哼了一下，翻了个身躺在床上。回想起真嗣和明日香在往昔的美好时光，她的心情似乎得到了些许慰藉。或许此刻，她终于能够安然入睡了。

"Wake up! We've got a problem!"
醒醒！出问题了！

Rei sat bolt upright, blinking in confusion. She hadn't actually fallen asleep yet, had she? She looked around to see that Misato was standing in the doorway to the bunkroom, Aida just behind her, and she quickly hopped out of bed. "What is the matter, Major?" she asked.
丽猛地坐起身，一脸迷茫地眨眼。她其实还没入睡，不是吗？她环视四周，发现美里站在寝室门口，相田紧跟其后，她急忙从床上跳下来。“少校，出什么事了？”她问道。

Frustration was etched into Misato's face. She gave a short growl before replying. "Ritsuko discovered that some idiot technician didn't dispose of the prototype dual sync plug, it's been mislabelled as the latest model and got put into Unit-01 today. Among other things Shinji and Asuka aren't running with an upgraded life support system."
美里的脸上写满了沮丧。她低声咆哮后说道：“律子发现有个笨蛋技术员没处理掉双同步插头的原型，结果这东西被误标为最新款，今天装进了初号机。还有，真嗣和明日香并未配备升级版的生命维持系统。”

Thinking quickly about the standard entry plug specifications, Rei came to the obvious conclusion. "So both of them are using a normal entry plug's life support system, which is not rated for two people and therefore only has half the capacity."
绫迅速考虑了标准插入栓的规格，随即得出了一个明显的结论：“看来两者使用的都是普通插入栓的生命维持系统，这种系统并非设计用于两人，所以其容量只有一半。”

Misato nodded. "Yeah. And now they only have about five and a half hours left."
碇真嗣点头道：“没错。现在他们只剩下大约五小时三十分钟了。”

Rei glanced at the wall clock next to the door, and was quietly surprised. She had fallen asleep, for about two hours. Two hours that had harshly reduced the time her trapped friends had left.
零瞥向门边的挂钟，心中暗自一惊。她不知不觉睡了过去，足足两个小时。这两个小时无情地削减了她被困朋友们所剩无几的时间。

Seemingly reading her mind, Aida said, "That's time we shouldn't have spent sleeping!"
艾达仿佛看穿了她的心思，说道：“那时间我们本不该用来睡觉的！”

Misato sighed, turning to head back out into the corridor. "There's nothing we can do about that now. Get freshened up if you need to, then come to the briefing room. We can't afford to waste any more time."
真嗣叹了口气，转身走向走廊。“现在这事我们也没办法。需要的话，去整理一下，然后来会议室。我们不能再耽搁了。”

TIME REMAINING: 5:32:56 剩余时间：5 小时 32 分 56 秒

In the darkness of the entry plug, the quiet was starting to prey on its occupants' minds. Both Shinji and Asuka had occasionally spoken up, thinking they had heard something neither of them had said or even thought. They needed a distraction, but there weren't many conversation topics available while trapped in a metal tube inside a void. And time was running out.
插入栓内的黑暗中，寂静逐渐侵蚀着乘员们的心神。真嗣和明日香不时打破沉默，误以为听见了彼此未曾出口甚至未曾思及的声音。他们急需转移注意力，然而身处金属管中，四周一片虚无，可供交流的话题实在有限。时间正一分一秒地流逝。

Shinji's stomach took that perfect moment to grumble. He blushed, putting a hand over his stomach to try and quell it, but his efforts were futile.
就在那个完美时刻，真嗣的肚子不争气地叫了起来。他顿时脸红，连忙用手捂住肚子，试图让它安静下来，然而一切努力都无济于事。

"Getting hungry?" 饿了吗？

"...Yeah." ...嗯，是的。

Asuka sighed. "Me too. For once I regret not eating before piloting."
明日香叹了口气。“我也一样。真后悔没在开飞机前吃点东西。”

Shinji gave a brittle smile. "What are you going to make when we get out of here?"
真嗣勉强笑了笑，问道：“我们离开这里后，你打算做些什么呢？”

"Hah!" He felt her slap the back of his seat. "Look at you being all optimistic!"
哈哈！" 她拍了拍他座椅的后背。"瞧你，还挺乐观的嘛！

"Well I'm not exactly eager to die trapped in limbo."
说实话，我并不想被困在炼狱中死去。

"Yes, but there's nothing we can do from in here. We don't have the power to try and escape, and it's inhospitable outside the Eva."
是的，但我们从这里无计可施。我们没有能力尝试逃离，而且外面环境对伊娃来说极为恶劣。

Shinji brought up a hand to rub at his forehead in frustration. He hated that she was right; all he wanted to do was power up and smash their way out of this ridiculous angel. But all that would happen would be a minute at best of aimless flailing... and then death by oxygen deprivation.
真嗣烦躁地举起手揉着额头，他讨厌她总是对的；他只想增强力量，砸开这个荒谬的天使逃出去。然而，这最多只会导致一分钟的盲目挣扎……随后便是因缺氧而死。

"Well actually, the power-on sequence alone would use up the rest of our power," Asuka helpfully added. "We wouldn't even get a second of flailing."
其实，光是启动过程就会耗尽我们剩下的电力，" 明日香补充说，"我们连一秒挣扎的时间都没有。

"I didn't say anything," Shinji retorted, before something struck him. He twisted in his seat to stare at her.
"我可什么都没说，" 真嗣反驳着，忽然间心头一动。他扭过身来，目光紧紧地盯着她。

"You did say something!" Asuka huffed, crossing her arms. "You said we'd get a minute of aimless flailing!"
你确实说过！" 明日香气鼓鼓地抱起双臂。"你不是说我们会有一分钟瞎折腾吗！

"No, I just thought that!"
不，我只是那么一想而已！

"Y-" Asuka froze, her eyes widening. "...Shit. We must've been in here too long. Our minds are starting to bleed together."
"Y-" 飞鸟愣住了，双眼圆睁。“...糟糕。我们肯定是在这里待得太久了。我们的意识开始交错了。”

"But we're powered down!" Shinji argued. "How could we be synchronising?"
可我们明明已经关机了啊！" 真嗣反驳道，"这怎么可能同步？

Asuka slumped in her seat, mirroring the hand-on-forehead slouch he had done just a minute ago.
明日香瘫坐在椅子上，学着他刚才手撑额头的样子。

"I... don't know." 我不太清楚。

XXX

Sparing only a moment to go to the bathroom, Rei rushed to catch up to Aida and Major Katsuragi, rejoining them in the corridor just outside the briefing room. They stepped into the room together, to see that Doctor Akagi as well as Lieutenants Ibuki, Aoba and Hyuga were already present. Papers and electronic devices were strewn about the table, and the ashtray was already half-full of Akagi's cigarette butts.
绫波丽仅匆匆去了趟洗手间，便急忙追上相田和葛城少校，在简报室外的走廊与他们会合。三人一同走进房间，发现赤木博士以及伊吹、青叶和日向中尉均已到场。桌上文件和电子设备凌乱，烟灰缸里已堆满了赤木抽剩的烟蒂。

Rei sat down across from the frazzled doctor, Aida taking the seat next to her. Major Katsuragi remained standing, hovering over Hyuga's shoulder.
丽坐在那位心烦意乱的医生对面，艾达紧挨着她坐下。葛城美里少校依旧站立，俯身在日向的肩旁。

"Just gonna get this out there right now," said Aida. "Lowering one of our Evas in, even just for a quick look, is out of the question?"
我现在就把话说开，"艾达说道，"让我们的一个 Eva 下去，哪怕只是快速探查一下，这都不行吗？

"Already thought of that," Akagi replied, not looking up from her computer. "Anything that gets caught in the void is sucked in. We almost lost a whole crane to it before the boom snapped off."
这我已经想到了，"赤城头也不抬地回答，目光仍停留在电脑上。"一旦有东西落入虚空，就会被吞噬。我们之前差点连整台起重机都赔进去，好在吊臂及时断了。

"So there is nothing we can do to pull them out," Rei clarified.
"因此，我们无计可施，无法将他们救出，" 蕾伊明确表示。

"We'd still have to find them first anyway," Misato remarked. "What with the other side of that void being either an entire other dimension or a portal to somewhere else in the universe."
我们首先得找到他们，" 碇真嗣指出。"毕竟那个虚空的另一端，要么是另一个完全不同的维度，要么是通往宇宙其他地方的传送门。

"At the moment I only have half of one plan," said Doctor Akagi. "A last resort sort of thing. Before I say what it is though, understand that I know this is going to sound terrible, to the point that at least one person here is most likely going to get angry at me."
眼下我只有一个计划的一半，"阿卡吉博士说道，"算是最后的手段。在我解释之前，请明白我知道这听起来会很糟，很可能让在场的某位感到愤怒。

Rei and Aida glanced at each other. "Is... this a scorched earth kind of terrible plan?" the male pilot hesitantly asked.
丽和艾达相视一眼。"这...难道是那种毁灭性的糟糕计划吗？"男飞行员犹豫地问道。

Akagi nodded dolefully. "Yes. The last resort is to drop every single N2 mine we have into the Angel, all 992 of them, and using your AT-Fields to help focus the blast into the Angel to disrupt it."
赤木忧郁地点了点头。“没错。最后的办法是把我们所有的 N2 地雷，总共 992 枚，全部投进使徒体内，并借助你的 AT 力场来聚焦爆炸，以此来破坏使徒。”

"What." Katsuragi's reply was accompanied by her eyes glaring daggers at the side of Akagi's head. "Are you actually suggesting we blow the kids to hell?!"
什么？" 葛城的眼神锐利如刀，直刺赤城的侧脸，"你这是在提议把孩子们送上西天吗？！

"Like I've said twice before, Misato," Akagi replied, glaring right back at the woman, "Last. Resort. If we can't get the pilots out intact, we still need to at least try and recover Unit-01. We cannot allow it to remain in the hands of an Angel."
正如我之前两次所言，葛城，" 赤木回瞪着那位女士，"这是我们的最后手段。即便无法确保驾驶员安全撤离，我们也必须尽力回收初号机。绝不能让它落入使徒手中。

"Wait," Aida interjected. "Wouldn't the mines just obliterate Unit-01?"
等等，" 阿依达打断说，"那些矿井难道不会直接摧毁一号机吗？

"The Evangelions can survive N2 mines," said Aoba. "...The occupants, on the other hands..."
青叶说：'福音战士能抵御 N2 地雷，但乘员们...'...

Now Aida was delivering an intense look as well. "So your answer to not getting Shinji and Asuka out safely is to let them die screaming in agony?!"
此刻，Aida 的眼神同样犀利。“难道你对于无法确保真嗣和明日香安全脱身的回应，就是任由他们在极度痛苦中惨叫着死去吗？！”

"No!" Ibuki practically shouted. "We are going to give them as much time as possible, in the hopes that they can escape! We'll only be dropping the N2 mines in after the point where their life support would have given out and they'd be... be..." She trailed off, looking like she was about to cry.
"不！"伊吹几乎是大声喊道。"我们要尽量拖延时间，希望他们能逃出去！我们只会在确认他们的生命维持系统已经耗尽，他们已经……已经……"她哽咽着，眼看着就要落泪。

"They'd be dead already by that point," Akagi finished, hesitantly raising a hand over Ibuki's shoulder before lamely letting it flop back down on the table. "I wasn't suggesting we go out right now and drop the bombs, there's still over five hours of life support left for them."
他们那时肯定已经没命了，"赤城说着，迟疑地抬手轻搭在五十岚肩上，最终还是无力地垂回桌面。"我并非提议立刻去投放炸弹，他们还有超过五小时的生命维持时间。

Rei finally spoke. "But there is no feasible way for us to mount a rescue. Any attempt from this end is doomed to failure. We cannot even be sure they are alive now, or that Unit-01 is still intact."
绫波丽最终打破了沉默。“然而，我们并没有切实可行的救援方案。任何从这里发起的行动都注定会失败。我们甚至无法确认他们是否还活着，零号机是否依然完好无损。”

"Afraid so," said Hyuga. "That's the problem with an Angel whose form can only be explained through advanced mathematics."
确实是这样，" 日向说道。"这种天使的形态，只能用高等数学来描述，这就是问题所在。

Rei looked away, staring at nothing. "That is a field neither I nor Pilot Aida can help with. There is no point in us pilots being here if we cannot assist with planning. May we please be excused, Major?"
丽转开视线，凝望着空无一物之处。“那片领域我和飞行员艾达都无能为力。如果我们无法协助策划，作为飞行员留在这里也无意义。少校，请允许我们告退，可以吗？”

Katsuragi sighed, covering her face with a hand. "...Yeah, dismissed," she eventually said, waving them off with her other hand. "Your Evas are already up on the surface, so you may as well head up there now too. You don't need to ready up now, just stay near the outpost."
葛城叹息着，用手遮住脸庞。"...好吧，解散，"她最终说道，另一只手挥了挥让他们离开。"你们的 Eva 已经运抵地面，你们也上去吧。无需现在准备，只需在哨站附近待命。"

"Yes ma'am," said Aida, giving a crisp salute despite the anxiety he had to be feeling.
"是的，女士，"艾达说道，尽管心怀焦虑，他依然利落地敬了一个军礼。

The journey to the surface was made in complete silence, although Aida was rather fidgety on the elevator ride. They silently parted ways on the surface after receiving a portable radio each from the NERV personnel stationed there. Aida headed off to their Evangelions, laying flat on the ground nearby, while Rei found herself strangely drawn to a nearby building.
前往地面的途中，尽管 Aida 在电梯里显得有些焦躁，但全程保持沉默。到达地面后，他们从 NERV 的驻守人员那里各自领到了一台便携式无线电，随后默默地各自离去。Aida 走向附近平放的 Evangelions，而 Rei 则不由自主地被一栋附近的建筑吸引。

Inside, an open elevator directly opposite the entrance seemed to call to her. With plenty of time left before the last resort, likely the only plan that would be put into action, Rei saw no problem with stepping into the elevator and going all the way to the top floor. There, the roof access door was also wide open as if she was expected to head outside. Ever cautious, Rei scanned the area, and then scanned the area, before slowly ascending the stairs to the doorway and poking her head out for a quick search. There was nothing in sight, but she remained vigilant as she stepped out onto the roof and looked around.
内部，正对入口的开放式电梯仿佛在召唤她。在采取最后手段之前还有充足时间，这很可能是唯一会实施的计划，Rei 认为乘电梯直达顶楼并无不妥。屋顶的门也敞开着，似乎在等待她的到来。Rei 始终保持警惕，她先仔细观察了周围，然后缓缓登上楼梯，探头快速扫视门外。视野中空无一物，但她仍保持警觉，踏出屋顶并环顾四周。

All she could see was the city of Tokyo-3, with the ominous shadow of Leliel off in the middle distance. There was no sign of anything that could have captured her attention, but for the moment Rei felt no desire to return to ground level. Instead she walked over to the edge, staring at Leliel through the chain-link safety fence as the setting sun gradually turned the sky red.
她眼前只有东京-3 市的景象，以及远处雷里尔那不祥的阴影。尽管没有吸引她目光的事物，但此刻绫波丽并不愿返回地面。她走向边缘，透过铁丝网护栏，凝望着雷里尔，夕阳正缓缓将天空染成一片绯红。

This Angel had taken Shinji and Asuka from her. The first two people she could consider as friends. She wanted little more than to throw caution to the wind by ripping the Angel apart with her AT-Field and dragging her friends back into the light. But that would cause far, far more problems than it would solve. After all, the energy required to personally assault the Angel would also tear her own body apart. It was simply not built to sustain an AT-Field as easily as an Evangelion.
这个使徒夺走了她视为朋友的真嗣和明日香。她多么渴望不顾一切，用 AT 力场将使徒撕碎，把朋友们拉回光明。然而，此举只会带来更多麻烦，因为以个人之力攻击使徒所需的能量同样会撕裂她自己的身体。她的身体毕竟不像 EVA 那样能轻易维持 AT 力场。

However, Commander Ikari would likely disapprove of her throwing away a body like that, even if it did recover Unit-01 as well as the pilots. While she would simply wake up in a new body, too many people would find out about her... other half. There would be far too many witnesses that would have to be dealt with.
然而，伊卡里指挥官恐怕不会赞同她如此轻易地舍弃身体，即便这能一并回收初号机和驾驶员。虽然她能轻易在新躯体中苏醒，但太多人将知晓她的另一重身份。需要处理的目击者实在太多。

Not to mention SEELE. 更别提 SEELE 了。

Rei sighed, her eyes unfocused. No matter what, it seemed, her friends only had a few hours to live. The only consolation was that a death by lack of oxygen would be a quiet one. They would simply fall unconscious in the entry plug and never wake up again. Her chest twinged; Shinji and Asuka didn't deserve such an ignoble death. Not when they were such an incredible example of Instrumentality without needing Instrumentality.
绫波叹息着，眼神涣散。无论怎样，她的朋友们似乎只剩下几个小时的寿命了。唯一的慰藉是，因缺氧而死将会是一种宁静的死亡。他们只会倒在插入栓内，从此长眠不醒。她的胸口一阵紧缩；真嗣和明日香不该遭受如此不光彩的死亡。他们无需借助人类补完计划，就已经是人类补完的杰出典范。

The evening breeze suddenly felt cold on part of her cheek. Rei raised a hand to her face, discovering a line of wetness coming from her eye. She looked down at the residue on her fingers for a moment, before the open hand became a fist.
傍晚的微风突然让她的脸颊感到一阵寒意。Rei 伸手抚摸脸庞，察觉到眼角滑落的泪痕。她凝视着手指上的泪迹片刻，随后张开的手掌紧握成拳。

To hell with it. She would accept whatever punishment Commander Ikari saw fit to mete out, and if she was careful there would be no witnesses anyway; at least not on the surface. She would rather try everything she could, even if it meant her second death, rather than simply stand back and wait for Shinji and Asuka to perish.
管它呢。她将接受碇司令认为恰当的任何惩罚，只要她谨慎行事，就不会有目击者；至少表面上如此。她宁愿竭尽所能，哪怕面临第二次死亡，也不愿坐视真嗣和明日香走向灭亡。

Rei turned away from the Angel, heading back to the rooftop access door, only to stop in a hurry. It was that or walk right into somebody that was standing in the way. She took a step back, wondering why her Sight was suddenly acting so strangely. Was she about to be attacked? Was it SEELE making a move, or another Angel?
绫转身离开使徒，正要返回屋顶的入口，却突然急停。要么是这样，要么就是差点撞上挡路的人。她后退一步，心中疑惑为何自己的“视界”突然变得如此异常。难道即将遭受攻击？是 SEELE 有所行动，还是另一个使徒？

"Good evening, Miss Ayanami," said the tall, flame-haired woman. "I believe the Infernal Administration can assist with your little problem."
晚上好，绫波小姐，"那位高挑、红发如火的女人说道，"我相信地狱行政部能助你一臂之力，解决这个小问题。

TIME REMAINING: 2:15:29 剩余时间：2 小时 15 分钟 29 秒

"Oh... s-shit." 哦...糟糕。

"W-what is it, Asuka?" 这是什么呀，飞鸟？

"H-heating's finally g-gone..."
供暖终于停了...

Shinji had been struggling mightily to not show any sign of the gradually dropping temperature for a while now, but Asuka was finally starting to feel it as well. Any longer and he wouldn't have been able to disguise the chattering of his teeth. "A-any id-ideas for g-getting out yet?"
真嗣一直极力隐藏气温逐渐下降的事实，如今明日香也终于有所察觉。再拖延下去，他恐怕就掩饰不住牙齿打颤的声音了。"想到...想到出去的办法了吗？"

"N-none. If it w-were any other Angel, I'd have ju-just powered up and f-fought it anyway, even if we d-died," replied Asuka. "D-die in battle, you kn-know. But th-there's n-nothing to f-fight here."
没有目标。如果是其他使徒，我早就提升力量去战斗了，哪怕最终战死，" 明日香回应说，"你知道的，战死在战场上。但这里根本无战可打。

"S-so what do we d-do now?" Shinji hunched over in his seat, frantically rubbing his arms. "At th-this rate we'll f-freeze to death before the air r-runs out."
那、那我们现在怎么办？" 真嗣蜷缩在座位上，焦急地搓着双臂。"再这样下去，我们会在氧气耗尽前先冻死的。

There was silence behind him for an uncomfortably long time; long enough to make Shinji worry that Asuka had fallen unconscious. Just as he was about to call her name, she spoke up.
他身后陷入了长时间的沉默，久得让真嗣担心明日香是否已经昏迷。正当他准备呼唤她时，她终于开口了。

"S-Shinji. C-come sit wi-with m-me."
S-Shinji，C-过来和我坐一起吧。

"W-w-w-what?!" This time, the stuttering wasn't just due to the cold. Shinji turned around to deliver a shocked expression, only to see the deadly serious look directed back at him.
"什、什、什、什么？！" 这次结巴并非仅因寒冷所致。真嗣转过身，本想展现震惊之情，却对上了对方那严肃至极的眼神。

"We n-need to share body h-heat," said Asuka. "I'm too c-c-cold to complain about anything else, s-so get up here and s-sit in front of m-me. Now."
我们得靠体温取暖，"Asuka 颤抖着说。"我冷得顾不上其他了，赶紧上来坐我前面。立刻。

She was right: survival was far more important than being embarrassed. If they survived, then Asuka could go on about him being a pervert. There was no point insulting a corpse. Mentally bracing himself just in case, Shinji stood and clambered up the plug to Asuka's seat. She silently pushed herself as far back into the seat as possible, leaving space for him to sit down. Gingerly, he took the offered space... and almost jumped out of his own skin when a pair of arms wrapped tightly around him, pulling him right up against Asuka's chest.
她说的没错：生存远比面子重要。只要能活下来，明日香大可继续骂他变态。对尸体发泄不满毫无意义。真嗣在心里做好准备，站起身，攀上插入栓，来到明日香的座位旁。她默不作声地尽量往后靠，为他腾出坐下的位置。他小心翼翼地坐下……却突然被一双胳膊紧紧抱住，拉向明日香的胸前，吓得他差点跳起来。

Well, he was already feeling warmer now, even if it was just from a full-body blush. And considering the circumstances, plus their seating arrangement, there would be little to fear from... thermal expansion.
嗯，他现在确实感到暖和了些，虽然只是因为脸红到了脖子根。考虑到眼下的情形和他们的座位布局，热胀冷缩的问题几乎可以忽略不计。

"We... we will get through this," Asuka murmured in his ear.
"我们...一定能挺过这一关，" 明日香轻声在他耳畔说道。

Despite everything, Shinji found that he truly believed her.
尽管一切，真嗣发现自己确实相信她。

XXX

"Infernal..." Rei echoed, before inhaling sharply. "You are-"
地狱般的……" 瑞低声重复，紧接着深吸一口气。"你竟然是-

"Yes indeed. I am Bwynvienne. A pleasure to meet you at last." The woman gave a short bow, before straightening up and looking Rei in the eyes. "Lilith."
没错，我是 Bwynvienne。很高兴终于与你相见。" 女子简短地鞠了一躬，随即挺直身姿，目光坚定地看向 Rei。"我叫 Lilith。

...This was unexpected, but considering what she already knew of this strange person, Rei should have realised that Bwynvienne could also tell exactly who and what she was.
...这确实出乎意料，但鉴于她对这位神秘人物已有的认知，Rei 早该明白，Bwynvienne 同样能准确识别出她的身份和本质。

"If you know who I am," she said aloud, "you know what I am capable of. Please step aside; I must go and save my friends."
如果你知道我是谁，"她大声说道，"你就知道我的能力。请让开，我得去救我的朋友们。

"That's actually why I'm here," replied Bwynvienne. "I do know what you're capable of. And I know that with your fractured soul you wouldn't survive the attempt, with the effort that you would have to put in. Do you even know how to enter a different dimension?"
这正是我来此的目的，" Bwynvienne 回应说。"我清楚你的能力所在。考虑到你那破碎的灵魂，你根本无法承受尝试的代价，那需要极大的努力。你可知道如何进入另一个维度？

"...No," Rei admitted. She had had no intention of hunting for them, rather she had been planning to shred the Angel and sift through the pieces, so to speak.
"...不，" 绫波坦承。她原本就没打算去寻找它们，而是计划将使徒撕成碎片，再从中仔细筛选，这么说吧。

The woman smiled widely. "That's where I can help. With my aid, you'll be able to rescue them safely."
那位女士笑容满面地说：“这正是我能助你一臂之力的地方。有了我的协助，你定能安全救出他们。”

"Why?" 为什么呢？

"...Why what?" ...为什么呢？

"Why are you helping?" Rei clarified. "What is in it for you?"
你为何要帮忙？" 雷伊追问道。"这对你有什么好处？

"Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley-Soryu are my clients," explained Bwynvienne, tapping a hand against her collarbone. "And the Infernal Administration has taken something of an interest in their somewhat unique situation. Rather similar to Gendo Ikari's, as a matter of fact, which is another reason why I pop in and out occasionally. Besides..." She looked over Rei's shoulder at the Angel. "Leliel has been... something of an irritation to us for quite a while."
Shinji Ikari 和 Asuka Langley-Soryu 是我的客户，"Bwynvienne 解释说，同时轻拍自己的胸口。"地狱管理局对他们这种颇为特殊的情况表现出了兴趣。实际上，这与 Gendo Ikari 的情况颇为相似，这也是我偶尔进出的原因之一。另外……"她越过 Rei 的肩膀，目光投向了天使。"Leliel 一直让我们感到相当头疼。

Rei frowned, glancing over her shoulder as well. "Irritation?" she echoed. That was certainly one word to use for this Angel.
绫皱着眉，同样回头望了一眼。“烦躁吗？”她重复道。这的确是形容这位天使的一个恰当词汇。

"Dimensional travel is strictly regulated," said Bwynvienne. "There is a lot of paperwork and fees to pay for such an undertaking, unless you're an agent like me that's cleared for it. Unfortunately, Leliel just seems to do whatever it wants in regard to dimension hopping, and because of the nature of its existence we can't do a thing about it. How do you arrest a mathematical concept?"
布温维耶说：'维度旅行受到严格管控，除非像我这样获得授权的特工，否则需要处理繁琐的手续并支付费用。但勒里尔在维度跳跃上似乎不受约束，鉴于其存在的特殊性，我们对此束手无策。试问，如何逮捕一个数学概念？'

Turning back to the woman, Rei exhaled softly. "What are you proposing?"
转身面向那位女士，Rei 轻柔地呼出一口气。“你有什么建议？”

Bwynvienne expansively waved a hand. "As an agent of the Infernal Administration, I have been charged to render whatever assistance I can in order to recover my clients and hopefully send a message to Leliel that we do not tolerate its shenanigans. Therefore, I am proposing that I lend you my power to aid in the rescue of your friends."
作为地狱行政部门的代理人，我受命尽我所能提供帮助，以寻回我的客户，并希望向 Leliel 发出信号，表明我们不容忍其胡作非为。因此，我建议向你提供我的力量，协助你营救朋友。

Rei tilted her head slightly to one side, not quite understanding the offer.
玲微微侧头，对这个提议感到有些困惑。

"It would be easier to show you," Bwynvienne continued. "First, though, I need your permission."
向你展示会更简单，" Bwynvienne 接着说，"但首先，我需要得到你的同意。

Time was running out for Shinji and Asuka. Rei didn't have time to debate the trustworthiness of this strange woman. Worst case, she could... deal with her. "Very well. You have my permission."
真嗣和明日香的时间所剩无几。绫波无暇质疑这位陌生女子的可靠性，最坏的情况，她自有办法应对。"好吧，我同意。"

The wind began to pick up; Bwynvienne gave Rei a smile as bright as her hair while her form began to shimmer. She raised a hand, index finger outstretched, and seemed to start drawing in the air with the finger. After a minute, she raised her other hand to point at Rei and then-
风势渐起，Bwynvienne 向 Rei 展露了一个明媚如她发丝的笑容，她的身形随之闪烁。她举起一只手，食指在空中轻轻勾勒。片刻后，她又举起另一只手，指向 Rei，接着——

Rei blinked. Bwynvienne had vanished without a trace. Had she changed her mind?
蕾眨了眨眼，布温维尼已无迹可寻。她是否改变了主意？

Of course not, Miss Ayanami. I'm an Infernal of my word.
当然不会，绫波小姐。我是个言出必行的恶魔。

She gasped, looking sharply around the rooftop, but there was still no sign of the woman.
她倒吸一口凉气，急忙环视屋顶，却依旧不见那女子的踪迹。

Come now, you're a clever young lady. Figure it out.
来吧，你这么聪明，自己琢磨琢磨。

"O-oh..." Rei lamely said, ignoring the fact that the voice seemed amused by her confusion. "You have... joined with me." She placed a hand to her chest, feeling the additional weight added to her fragmented soul.
"哦...” 蕾无力地开口，对那声音因她的困惑而显得饶有兴致置若罔闻。“你已经...与我合为一体了。” 她将手放在胸口，感受着那破碎灵魂中新增的沉重。

Yes, temporarily of course. No offence, but it's a right state in here. Not exactly a cosy living space, if you know what I mean, and that's putting it very politely.
是的，只是暂时的。没有冒犯之意，但这地方确实挺乱的。说得好听点，这绝不是个温馨的居住环境。

Being the one that had to live like this, Rei knew exactly what Bwynvienne meant. It was however a little disturbing that she could visualise the state of her soul. "What happens now?"
身为必须如此生活的人，Rei 深知 Bwynvienne 所言何意。但她竟能想象出自己灵魂的状态，这着实令人不安。"接下来会怎样？"

Now, we do nothing for the moment. After that transition, we both need to restore our strength a bit. Admit it, you feel a little weak right now, yes? I can take this time to teach you how to get in there.
目前，我们暂且按兵不动。经历那次转变后，我们得稍作休整，恢复体力。你得承认，此刻你确实感到有些乏力，不是吗？我可以利用这段时间教你如何进入那个地方。

Indeed, Rei felt strangely fatigued. "Very well, but it will not be long before my friends are declared lost and NERV decides to bombard the Angel to... recover their property." She glanced at the radio in her hand. "Speaking of which, I must contact NERV and let them know we are going to rescue Shinji and Asuka."
确实，绫波感到莫名的疲倦。“好吧，但不久我的朋友们就会被宣告失踪，NERV 将决定轰炸天使以...夺回他们的资产。”她瞥了一眼手中的无线电。“对了，我得联系 NERV，告诉他们我们将去营救真嗣和明日香。”

If you don't mind, I would prefer to keep my involvement quiet.
若你不介意，我更希望我的参与保持隐秘。

"Alright. I am sure Doctor Akagi would be disinclined to believe this, anyway." Rei raised the radio to her mouth. "Pilot Ayanami to NERV HQ. I would like to request a secure line to Doctor Akagi in regards to the Angel."
好的。我确信赤木博士无论如何都不会相信这一点。" 绫波丽将无线电举到嘴边。"Ayanami 飞行员呼叫 NERV 总部。我想请求与赤木博士就使徒问题进行安全通话。

A minute later, the scientist's voice came through the speaker. "What is it, Rei? We're in the middle of getting the bombers ready to deploy."
片刻之后，科学家的声音从扬声器中传出："Rei，有什么事吗？我们正忙着准备轰炸机进行部署。"

"That will not be necessary, Doctor." Rei turned and directed a stony glare at the black-and-white orb in the middle of the city. "I have a plan."
医生，那倒不必了。" 雷转身，目光冷冽地投向城市中心的黑白球体。"我已有打算。

Shinji felt his head lolling forward and jerked it back upright, only just remembering in time that there was somebody sitting directly behind him. He carefully tilted his head backwards until it was sitting against the seat.
真嗣感到头不由自主地向前垂，赶紧拉回原位，这才想起后面坐着人。他小心翼翼地把头往后靠，直到稳稳地倚在椅背上。

"Ox'gen's n'rly gone," Asuka mumbled, her chin resting on his shoulder. "Won't be much longer 'fore we fall 'sleep and nev'r wake up 'gain."
氧气快耗尽了，" 明日香低声说着，下巴靠在他的肩上。"我们很快就会睡去，再也醒不来了。

"Nuh," Shinji eloquently replied. "W'll be s'ved. Rei pr'm'sed."
不，" 碇真嗣流畅地回应道，"我们会得救的，绫波已经承诺了。

He felt Asuka smile at his words. "She's prob'ly tearing th' Angel a new d'mens'nal 'sshole right now."
他感觉到明日香因他的话而微笑。"她此刻或许正给那使徒撕开一道新的维度裂口。"

Shinji snorted in amusement, but didn't have the energy to keep the conversation going. It seemed like blackness was starting to creep in on the edges of his vision, and he was oh-so-tired.
真嗣忍不住轻笑一声，却已无力维持对话。黑暗开始在视野边缘蔓延，他感到前所未有的疲倦。

"Tell me something, Shinji. What frightens you more: being rejected, or you or Asuka dying before you can tell her how you feel?"
跟我说说，真嗣。你更害怕的是什么：被拒绝，还是你或明日香在有机会表达你的感情之前就离世？

And just like that, the tiredness vanished. Kaji's words echoed around his mind, bouncing off the inside of his skull.
就这样，疲惫感瞬间消散。加治的话语在他脑海中回荡，仿佛在头骨内壁上弹跳。

"S'matter?" Asuka must have felt his full body jolt.
"怎么了？" 明日香一定察觉到了他全身的震颤。

"Uh... n-nothing. Just... trying to stay awake," Shinji awkwardly replied, praying fervently that Asuka wasn't paying attention to his thoughts. Thankfully, either she was too tired or the creepy minds-bleeding-together thing had worn off.
"呃...没什么。只是...努力保持清醒，" 碇真嗣尴尬地回应，内心默默祈祷明日香没有察觉到他的心思。还好，她可能太累了，或者那种令人不安的思维交融已经消失了。

"What frightens you more?"
你更害怕什么？

Shinji squeezed his eyes shut, but the words seemed to be written on the insides of his eyelids.
真嗣紧闭双眼，然而那些话语似乎就刻在他的眼皮内侧，挥之不去。

"Instead of just assuming the worst, look back at the time you've spent with each other. What you've been through together."
不要总是往最坏处想，回望你们相伴的岁月，共同经历的那些时刻。

Death seemed to be incredibly close, and to Shinji's surprise he found that it wasn't as terrifying as he had expected, all things considered. Perhaps it was because he would apparently just fall asleep forever, or perhaps it was because Asuka was with him.
死亡仿佛触手可及，令真嗣意外的是，他发现这并不如预想中那般令人恐惧，综合各种因素来看。可能是因为他似乎将永远沉睡，也可能是因为有明日香相伴。

"'suka?," he slurred, and felt his co-pilot focus on him.
‘喜欢吗？’他口齿不清地说，感觉到副驾驶正专注地注视着他。

"Wh't?" 什么？

"Jus' in case... you know... we don' make it," Shinji nervously began, struggling to summon up the energy. "'s there an'thin' y'feel like sayin'?"
万一...我们没能成功，" 真嗣紧张地开口，费力地鼓起勇气，"你有什么话想说吗？

"Mmm..." Asuka hummed in thought for a moment. Her head drifted side to side as she tried to stay awake and alert. "Nah. Had a g'd life. No r'grets. Gl'd we 'came fr'nds. Don' wanna die 'lone."
嗯……" 明日香沉吟片刻，脑袋左右晃动，尽力保持清醒。"不，我的人生很美好，无怨无悔。很高兴与你成为朋友。我不想孤独终老。

"...Same." Shinji felt his heart sink. Either this still wasn't enough to get her to say anything concrete, or Asuka simply thought of him as just a friend.
"...还是老样子。" 真嗣感到心情沉重。看来这仍未能让她吐露心声，或者明日香仅仅视他为普通朋友。

…

To hell with it. If they were going to die together, which was looking increasingly likely as the seconds rushed by, then Shinji wanted to be like Asuka; no regrets.
管他呢。如果他们真的要一起赴死，随着时间无情流逝，这可能性愈发明显，那么真嗣希望自己能如明日香般；了无遗憾。

"'suka." 喜欢。

"Wh't?" 什么？

This time she sounded irritated. Shinji summoned up the last of his strength.
这次她的声音显得有些恼怒。真嗣竭尽全力，用上了最后一点力气。

"Got... som'thin' myself, jus' 'n case."
我自己也备了点东西，以防万一。

"...Yeah?" ...嗯？

"Happy we're... friends too. Don' wan' die 'lone either. 'nd..." He shifted in hi-their seat so that he could look her in the eye without twisting his neck. "And..."
我们很快乐...也是朋友。同样不想孤独终老。" 他调整了坐姿，以便能直视她的眼睛而不必扭动脖子。"还有...

Live or die, Shinji Ikari was going to tell Asuka Langley-Soryu how he felt.
不论结果如何，碇真嗣决心向明日香·兰格雷坦白自己的心意。

Asuka, with eyes half-closed, opened her mouth. "Wha-"
明日香半眯着眼，张口欲言：“什-”

He leaned forward. 他身体前倾。

TIME REMAINING: 0:09:56 剩余时间：9 分 56 秒

"We are running out of time."
我们的时间不多了。

We have plenty. Trust me.
我们很充足。相信我。

"If this does not work-"
如果这个方法行不通-

I'm an Infernal of my word. We will get them back.
我言出必行，定会将他们夺回。

Rei looked skyward at the planes circling overhead like vultures. The Angel was still set to be bombarded as soon as NERV decided that the pilots were unrecoverable. There was only ten minutes left until the first bombs would begin to fall.
丽仰望着天空，那些飞机在头顶盘旋，仿佛秃鹫一般。只要 NERV 确定驾驶员无法恢复，天使就会立即遭到轰炸。现在，离第一批炸弹开始落下只剩下十分钟了。

Unit-00 and Unit-02 were standing on opposite ends of the Angel, a couple hundred metres away from the edge, for all the good they could do. Rei was only in her Evangelion to try and disguise what she was about to do. It would be far easier to explain things away as something a giant bio-mechanical weapon had accomplished rather than a fourteen year old girl.
零号机和二号机分别站在使徒的两端，离边缘几百米，尽管它们能提供的帮助微乎其微。绫波驾驶着她的福音战士，只是为了掩盖她即将采取的行动。将事情归咎于巨型生化机械武器，比归咎于一个十四岁少女要容易得多。

A voice came through on a secure comm channel. "Everything's ready on my end, Rei. Do whatever it is you're planning."
安全通信频道中传来声音：“我这边已经准备妥当，零。执行你的计划吧。”

"Understood," was her simple reply, before switching off the comm. She drew a deep breath, before closing her eyes and slowly exhaling.
"明白了。"她简短回应后，切断了通讯。深吸一口气，闭目缓缓吐息。

Now that you know how to get in there, we're all set too. I'll be both helping to hold your self together, and acting as a... navigator, I suppose. Ready?
既然你已知晓如何进入，我们也已就绪。我会在帮你维持自我的同时，充当你的导航者。准备就绪了吗？

"Yes." 是的。

Then let's go. 那咱们就出发吧。

Rei's vision went white as she felt something akin to her soul fly out of her body. When sight returned, she was floating directly above the black void of Leliel. A glance down at herself showed absolutely nothing; she was essentially invisible. Rei set her jaw and dove in.
绫波的视野突然一片空白，她感到自己的灵魂似乎脱离了肉体。视线恢复后，她发现自己悬浮在雷里尔的深邃黑暗之上。低头一看，自己竟然消失无踪；她几乎完全隐形。绫波坚定地咬紧牙关，纵身跃入其中。

A sensation of ice water flooding over her non-existent skin made Rei shiver for a moment, and then her 'eyes' started to feel strange. There was no blackness or whiteness; in fact there was a complete absence of... anything. Perhaps this was what it looked like beyond the event horizon of a black hole.
Rei 感到一股冰水般的寒意掠过她那并不存在的肌肤，不禁打了个寒颤，紧接着她的“眼睛”开始感到异样。这里没有黑与白，实际上，是一片虚无。或许这便是黑洞事件视界之外的景象。

"How am I supposed to search like this?" asked Rei. "I cannot even be sure I can see anything."
这样我该怎么搜索呢？" Rei 问道，"我连能否看到东西都不确定。

That's what I'm here for. Together we can search this void between dimensions.
我正是为此而来。让我们携手探寻这维度之间的未知领域。

"Between... So Shinji and Asuka have not been transported elsewhere in the universe?"
也就是说，真嗣和明日香并未被传送至宇宙的其他角落？

No. Otherwise, no offence, I would be able to find them myself. Now then, this might feel a little funny, but it's necessary.
不，并非有意冒犯，其实我自己本可以找到它们。不过，这感觉可能有点怪，但确实有必要这么做。

Rei felt a tap against her soul, and something finally appeared in the void, looking like a shockwave expanding outward from her. Realisation quickly dawned. "You are using me as a sort of sonar."
蕾感到灵魂被轻触，虚空中终于浮现出某种东西，仿佛从她身上向外扩散的冲击波。她迅速领悟：“你在用我当作一种声呐。”

Sonar? What's that? 声纳是什么东西？

"A method of using sound waves underwater for navigation or detection."
一种使用水下声波进行导航或探测的技术。

There was a sensation that made Rei think of a raised eyebrow. Clever. This is definitely something similar; I'm using your soul to try and detect other souls in the area. It wouldn't work on my own because my soul is fundamentally different to both you and your friends.
一种感觉让 Rei 联想到了挑眉的动作。真是巧妙。这确实类似；我正借助你的灵魂来探测附近的其他灵魂。仅靠我自己是不行的，因为我的灵魂本质上有别于你和你的朋友们。

"What is its range?" 它的范围是多少？

Effectively limitless here, but of course it could potentially take a lot of time for something to bounce back to us if we just sit around. Time is somewhat different in here though; it's barely even been a few seconds outside. That's why I said we have plenty of time.
此地看似无穷无尽，若我们静候，某些反馈或许耗时甚久。然而，此处时间流逝异于外界，仅片刻而已。正因如此，我才说我们时间充裕。

Rei hesitated. "...But this place could be infinitely large."
绫迟疑了一下。“……不过，这里或许是无边无际的。”

True, but your friends shouldn't have been in here long enough to drift beyond what we could reach, so let's start looking.
确实如此，但你的朋友们应该不会在这里逗留太久，以至于漂流到我们无法触及的范围，我们得赶紧开始寻找。

TIME REMAINING: 0:07:32 剩余时间：7 分 32 秒

Ritsuko's eyes kept flickering back to the countdown timer. The MAGI had done what they could to predict how much time the pilots of Unit-01 had left, but even they couldn't see into the void. For all they knew, Unit-01 had attempted to fight its way out only to lose power hours ago.
律子的眼神频频瞥向倒计时器。MAGI 系统虽已竭尽所能预测初号机驾驶员的剩余时间，但面对未知，它们也无能为力。据目前所知，初号机或许曾尝试突围，却在数小时前因能量耗尽而陷入沉寂。

The timer was their best guess, deciding that Shinji and Asuka had recognised that they would need to conserve power, and that nothing had tried to kill them. Pilot Soryu might be a hellcat, wild and unruly, but Ritsuko chose to believe that even the battle-obsessed teenager would see the wisdom of patience in this situation.
计时器是他们最佳的推测，他们认为真嗣和明日香已认识到必须节约能源，且未遭遇任何致命威胁。尽管驾驶员惣流性格狂野、难以驾驭，律子仍相信，即使是这个沉迷战斗的少女，也能在这情况下领悟到耐心的重要性。

"I can't believe we're just sitting here waiting for them to die."
真不敢相信，我们竟坐视不理，任由他们走向死亡。

Misato's bitter words cut through Ritsuko's musing. She looked at her friend to see the woman, arms folded and eyebrows furrowed, staring at the screen that currently showed Unit-00. If Misato's eyes were lasers, there would have been a pair of holes bored all the way to the surface of Tokyo-3.
美里尖锐的话语打断了律子的思绪。她望向朋友，只见对方双臂抱胸，眉头紧蹙，目光紧锁在屏幕上显示的零号机。若美里的眼神能化作激光，东京-3 的地表恐怕早已被穿出两个洞来。

"I'm not going to order the drop until it's absolutely clear that they've perished," said Ritsuko. "Even after losing life support, they might survive for about five minutes until Unit-01 makes it out. Any more than that, though, and we'd be quickly getting into major brain damage issues even if they did escape before suffering brain death."
我不会在完全确认他们已遇难前下令撤离，" 里津子表示。"即便生命维持系统失效，他们或许还能坚持约五分钟，直至零号机脱险。但若超过此限，即便他们未遭遇脑死亡，脑损伤也将迅速加剧。

"...How major?" Misato quietly asked.
"...有多重要？" 碇真嗣轻声问道。

There was no point sugar coating it. "Bad enough that they would no longer be able to function normally. Worst case, they might as well be dead."
粉饰这一点毫无意义。"情况糟糕到他们将无法正常运作，最坏的情况下，他们简直生不如死。"

One of Misato's fingers began tapping rapidly on her arm. "...Add another five minutes to the timer then," she said, her voice a dead monotone.
碇真嗣的一根手指开始在手臂上急促地敲打。"...那就把计时器再延长五分钟吧，"她用毫无感情的语调说道。

The growing despair evident on Misato's face made Ritsuko sorely regret what she had to say. "I would, but the timer has already taken that into account. There's actually only a couple minutes before Unit-01 is completely out of power."
三佐脸上愈发明显的绝望让律子深感懊悔，她不得不说：“我本想这么做，但计时器已经考虑到了这一点。实际上，零号机再过几分钟就会彻底耗尽电力。”

The tapping finger's hand clenched into a fist. "Damnit... just... give them back you bastard..."
敲击的手指紧握成拳，怒道：“该死……快把他们还给我，你这混蛋……”

"I do not mean to question you, but..."
我并非有意质疑，只是想说...

I know. We should have found them by now. Logically speaking, it should have only taken a couple minutes in here. Something's gone wrong! We're more than three times as far out as we should have been, and there's still no sign! Frustration was evident in Bwynvienne's ethereal voice. It was perhaps the only thing stopping Rei from believing she had been tricked.
我明白。按理说，我们早该找到他们了。逻辑上，在这里只需片刻功夫。肯定是哪里出了差错！我们已偏离预定位置三倍有余，依旧毫无发现！Bwynvienne 那幽灵般的声音中透露出明显的挫败感。或许正是这份情绪，让 Rei 不至于相信自己被愚弄了。

"Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve?" she asked, even though she already knew the answer.
"你还有别的妙招吗？"她问道，其实她心里已有答案。

...No... I'm... I'm sorry. I...
...不...我...真的对不起。我...

Whether the despair Rei now felt was her own or Bwynvienne's, it did not matter. "Very well," she said. "Let us return. I will do what I should have done to begin with."
蕾此刻感受到的绝望究竟源自她自己还是布温维恩，已无关紧要。“好吧，”她开口道，“我们回去。我会履行我本该一开始就承担的责任。”

...Yeah, okay... ...嗯，行吧...

With the Infernal's help, the trek back to their entrance point was made in grim silence as Rei mentally prepared herself for what she would need to do. Her soul was feeling the strain of their extra-dimensional journey; all she could do now was hope that Bwynvienne could hold her together long enough so that she could see the faces of her friends one last time.
在恶魔的协助下，Rei 默默地踏上了返回入口点的路途，心中为即将面临的任务做着准备。她的灵魂因跨越维度的旅行而承受着巨大压力，此刻她只能寄希望于 Bwynvienne 能支撑她足够久，让她有机会再次与朋友们相见。

TIME REMAINING: 0:04:02 剩余时间：4 分 2 秒

Rei inhaled sharply, her body jolting upon her return. She put a hand to her chest, noting with some satisfaction that the extra weight on her now slightly more ragged soul was still there; Bwynvienne hadn't left yet.
蕾伊猛吸一口气，身体因归来而一震。她将手放在胸口，略感满意地察觉到，她那已略显残破的灵魂上新增的重负依旧在；布温维恩尚未离去。

However, despite her burning desire to rescue her friends, Rei didn't want to simply murder this being. Just as she had had no true desire to assist in the deaths of the other Angels; it was simply a matter of survival. There was one last thing for her to try before going in for the kill.
尽管丽内心燃烧着拯救朋友的渴望，她并不愿轻易夺走这个生物的生命。正如她之前并无意助长其他天使的死亡一样；这纯粹是为了生存。在决定痛下杀手之前，她还有最后一招要试。

Just like before, Rei closed her eyes and breathed in and out. This time, instead of leaving her body she unfurled her AT-Field in a very particular way, directing it at Leliel. She felt the reaction of the Angel, a sense of unease as she forcefully made contact with it. But her patched-together soul was not intended for this sort of energy expenditure. If she had been driving a car, at this point parts would be dropping off of it. Bwynvienne's presence was simply serving to pick them up and tape them back on.
如同往常，绫波闭上双眼，深呼吸。这次，她并未脱离躯体，而是以独特方式展开 AT 力场，直指雷里尔。她察觉到天使的反应，一种因被迫接触而生的不安。然而，她那拼凑而成的灵魂并非为此等能量消耗所设计。若比作驾驶汽车，此刻恐怕已是零件四散。布温维涅的存在，仅是拾起这些散落的零件，用胶带勉强修补。

"Leliel." 莱利尔。

The Angel shuddered upon hearing Her voice.
天使听到她的声音，不禁打了个寒颤。

"You know exactly who I am. You have sensed me ever since your arrival. You have something that belongs to me."
你完全明白我是谁。自从你来到这里，你就能感觉到我的存在。你手中握有本属于我的东西。

Leliel's AT-Field was shaking like a tree in a hurricane. Its shadow above Tokyo-3 rippled, the colours flowing like water. The ground itself was shaking hard enough to be felt through the feet of an Evangelion. Inside Unit-00, the glowing of its occupant's eyes lit up the entire entry plug as Rei's hands clenched hard enough on the controls to crack them.
雷里尔的 AT 力场在狂风中摇曳，宛如一棵树。它在东京-3 上方的影子波动起伏，色彩如水般流淌。地面震动剧烈，连福音战士都能通过双脚感知。在零号机内，驾驶员眼中的光芒照亮了整个插入栓，绫波紧握操纵杆，力道之大竟使其出现裂痕。

"This is your only warning. Though I would regret the loss of yet another of our kind, I will not hesitate if you force my hand.
这是你唯一的警告。虽然失去我们中的一员我会感到惋惜，但若你逼我出手，我绝不会犹豫。

"Give. Them. Back." 还给他们。

The sphere began to violently distort, parts of it appearing to be sucked in towards the centre while other parts bulged outwards. The void underneath roiled like the ocean in a storm, at one point expanding enough to force Unit-02 to back away from it.
球体开始剧烈变形，部分区域仿佛被中心吸引而内陷，其他部分则向外凸起。底下的虚空翻涌不息，犹如风暴中的大海，一度扩张到迫使二号单位不得不后退。

"W-what's going on?!" its pilot frantically asked, staring nervously at what was unfolding.
"这是怎么回事？！" 飞行员惊慌失措地问道，紧张地注视着眼前发生的一切。

As suddenly as it began, the bizarre scene stopped. The sphere, the shadow of Leliel, turned entirely black, floating down to the ground as the void began to shrink. The moment the sphere touched the ground, the same moment the void disappeared entirely, it shattered like glass, sending fragments scattering through the air and vanishing.
正如其突如其来，这诡异的一幕又骤然停止。Leliel 的阴影所形成的球体彻底变黑，随着虚空的收缩缓缓降落地面。当球体触地的刹那，虚空也彻底消散，它如同玻璃般碎裂，碎片在空中四散，旋即消失无踪。

TIME REMAINING: 0:03:46 剩余时间：3 分 46 秒

Rei's head lolled back and forth as the glow in the entry plug faded. A mental tap on the shoulder from her passenger brought her back to alertness, and Unit-00 charged forward towards the prone Evangelion laying in the middle of the street.
绫波的头无力地左右摆动，插入栓内的光芒渐渐消退。脑海中仿佛有人轻拍她的肩膀，使她瞬间清醒，零号机便朝着横卧在街道中央的使徒疾驰而去。

With no effort it ripped off the armour covering the entry plug, which automatically ejected and began venting LCL. Unit-00 quickly wrapped a hand around the plug to stop the venting, bringing it up to be cradled against its chest. Unit-00 turned and sprinted through the city towards the nearest Geofront entrance, where it gingerly set its precious cargo down near the vehicles that had just emerged. People began swarming over the plug as Rei lowered the Evangelion to a prone position so that she could eject.
它轻而易举地撕开了覆盖在插入栓上的装甲，插入栓随即自动弹出，LCL 开始排放。零号机迅速用手紧紧抓住插入栓，阻止其排放，并将其抱在胸前。随后，零号机转身向最近的地下都市入口疾奔，到达后小心翼翼地将插入栓放置在刚驶出的车辆旁。人们立刻围拢过来，绫波则将福音战士放倒，准备弹射出驾驶舱。

Dropping to the ground hard enough to almost break something, Rei shoved her way through the crowd, practically hurling away people much larger and heavier than her until she reached the now-open plug. She stuck her head through the hatch, ignoring the two people currently standing on either side of the pilot seat doing whatever they were doing with their equipment. She stared at the two people in the seat, blinking and rubbing her eyes to confirm both what she could see, and what she could see.
重重摔在地上，几乎要摔坏东西，Rei 奋力挤过人群，几乎是将比自己高大沉重的人推开，直到她抵达那已敞开的插座。她探头进入舱口，对驾驶座两侧正忙于操作设备的两人视而不见。她凝视着座位上的两人，眨眼并揉眼，只为确认眼前所见。

Her heart... 她心中...

...

...soared. ...急剧上升。

Two pairs of eyes slowly opened partway; two heads raised slightly so that they could look at her.
两对眼睛半睁，两个头微微抬起，以便望向她。

"H-heh... y-you did say... that you would c-come... f-for us."
呵呵...你确实说过...你会来找我们。

Rei was so relieved she didn't even care that Shinji and Asuka had spoken at the same time, pauses and all, or that their eyes closed and their breathing evened out. They were alive.
绫波感到无比宽慰，全然不在意真嗣和明日香是否异口同声，是否有所停顿，也不介意他们闭上双眼，呼吸渐趋平稳。重要的是，他们都安然无恙。

...Well, regardless of how it happened, our bargain is fulfilled. Farewell for now, Miss Ayanami.
无论如何，我们的交易已经完成。暂且告辞，绫波小姐。

The weight left Rei's soul, and with it the last of her strength. She collapsed across Shinji and Asuka, and the last thing she perceived before the blackness overtook her was two differently coloured gloved hands reaching out for her.
重负自绫波丽的灵魂中消散，带走了她最后的气力。她瘫倒在真嗣和明日香身上，在黑暗彻底笼罩之前，她最后所见是两只颜色迥异的手套正伸向她。

### Chapter 31 I Can't Do It Again

The door to Ritsuko's office slid open. She looked up to see the haggard face of her friend Misato standing there, leaning on the door frame. Without a word she waved her into the office, whereupon Misato stumbled in and crashed full length on the sofa opposite Ritsuko's desk.
律子办公室的门悄然开启，她抬头望去，只见好友美里一脸疲惫地倚在门边。律子默不作声地示意她进来，美里步履蹒跚地走进房间，随即重重地倒在办公桌对面的沙发上。

This latest attack had put NERV through hell in more ways than one and even now, several days later, Ritsuko was still trying to catch up. She barely had the time to spare to go home and feed her cats; several times she'd had to delegate that task to Maya while she tried to nap on the sofa. It was a pain in the ass to fold the bed out but it was better than trying to sleep in her chair, and the bunkrooms required traipsing through far too many corridors while already half-asleep.
这次最新袭击让 NERV 深陷困境，多种挑战接踵而至。即便数日已过，律子仍在奋力追赶进度。她几乎无暇回家照料猫咪，多次不得不将此事托付给玛雅，自己则趁机在沙发上打个盹。虽然展开沙发床颇为费事，但总比在椅子上勉强入睡要舒适，何况前往宿舍区还需穿过众多走廊，半梦半醒间实在不便。

"Your paperwork all done then?" Ritsuko asked, barely able to mask her own tiredness.
"你的文件都处理好了吗？" 律子问道，难掩倦意。

Misato grumbled something that was muffled by the cushion, before slowly turning her head sideways so that she could speak clearly. "No, still going. Came to see if you had an update on the kids."
碇真嗣嘟囔着，声音被垫子捂得含糊不清，随后缓缓侧过头来，以便清晰地说话。"不，还在继续。我来是想看看你有没有孩子们的最新消息。"

"Oh." Ritsuko had been expecting this question, but that didn't make things any easier. "Afraid there's still not much to say yet. Rei's still in a serious condition, and as for the other two... well..." She paused, momentarily removing her glasses so she could try and rub the sleep out of her eyes. "They're still unconscious. About all I've managed to do is come up with a hypothesis to explain their unnatural ability to synchronise so perfectly. Do you know what quantum entanglement is?"
哦。" 虽然预料到这个问题，但情况并未因此变得轻松。"恐怕目前仍无太多可说的。绫波的状况依然严重，至于另外两位……嗯……" 她停顿了一下，摘下眼镜试图揉去眼中的睡意。"他们仍处于昏迷状态。我所做的，不过是提出一个假设来解释他们为何能如此完美地同步。你知道量子纠缠是什么吗？

Misato groaned into the sofa. "Are you really asking me that now?" With a final huff, she somehow managed to get herself seated upright. "Isn't that the theoretical thing where two objects are linked so that if something happens to one, it also happens to the other?"
碇真嗣倒在沙发上呻吟道：“你现在真的要问我这个吗？”最后她叹了口气，勉强坐直了身子。“那不就是理论上两个物体相互关联，一个发生变动，另一个也会随之变化的情况吗？”

"Close enough," Ritsuko said with a nod. "Something like that appears to be sporadically happening with Shinji and Asuka's minds. If one of them brushes hair out of their face, the other mimics the gesture instantly. There isn't even a millisecond's difference between them when they start acting like this. The best performers in the world can't manage that level of synchronicity."
差不多，" 律子点头说道，"真嗣和明日香的心智间似乎偶尔会出现这种同步现象。比如一人拨开脸上的头发，另一人会立即做出相同动作，两者之间毫无时间差。即便是世界顶尖的表演者，也难以达到如此高度的同步。

"But how can something like quantum entanglement only happen some of the time?" Misato asked.
"但量子纠缠这样的现象，怎么会只是偶尔出现呢？" 米萨托问道。

"...I'm afraid that's where my hypothesis breaks down," Ritsuko admitted with a shrug. "And short of completely rewiring Shinji and Asuka's minds, I'm not sure what we could do to stop it. The best we can do is stop them spending too much time together in an Eva again, and try to get them to do as much as possible that's different from each other. I'm considering trying to move them to separate apartments-"
...恐怕我的假设在这里站不住脚，" 律子坦白道，肩膀一耸。"除非彻底改造真嗣和明日香的心智，否则我不清楚我们还有什么办法可以阻止。我们能做的就是尽量减少他们在 Eva 中的共同时间，并促使他们尽可能多地做些与对方不同的事情。我正考虑将他们安置到不同的公寓中，以期有所改变。

"No," Misato cut in. "That would do more harm than good. Even if it was just next door again, they'd both start getting temperamental at how unfair it is that one of them had to move out. Besides..." One of her fingers began tapping on the armrest. "They're good for each other. Look at how much they've changed just in the last few months. Asuka isn't nearly half as much of a hellion as she used to be back in Germany, and Shinji's actually managed to break out of the shell he must have had around himself while he was living with his teacher. The reports that man sent had almost nothing interesting involving Shinji. No friends, no outings, not even any injuries of importance. He might as well have just been reporting on a house cat."
不，" 葛城插话道，"那样只会适得其反。即使只是再次搬到隔壁，他们俩都会因为其中一人必须搬走而感到不公，脾气也会变得暴躁。而且……" 她的一根手指开始轻敲扶手。"他们彼此很合得来。看看这几个月他们的变化。明日香在德国时比现在难缠得多，而真嗣也终于打破了与老师同住时的那种自我封闭。那人发来的报告中，关于真嗣的内容几乎毫无亮点，没有朋友，没有外出，甚至没有值得一提的伤病。他简直就像是在报告一只家猫的生活。

"...I hate to admit it, but you're right," said Ritsuko after a moment to remember the reports on both teenagers. "Meeting each other was probably the best thing that could have happened to them, especially when it comes to piloting. Asuka pushes Shinji to do better, to the point where I'd almost think he was starting to enjoy piloting, and he seems to be acting as a brake on her ego so she doesn't run roughshod over everyone else. She's still the best and knows it, but instead of lording it over the other three she's trying to pull them up to her level."
...虽然我不愿承认，但你说的没错，" Ritsuko 稍作停顿，回忆起关于这两位青少年的报告后说道。"他们相遇或许是最佳的安排，尤其在驾驶方面。Asuka 激励 Shinji 不断进步，几乎让他开始享受驾驶，同时他也在抑制她的傲气，避免她过于强势。她虽自知是最优秀的，却不再高高在上，而是努力带动其他三人提升至她的水平。

Misato slouched against the sofa and sighed heavily. "I wish they'd wake up soon. It's hell not knowing if they're alright after losing life support. Have the doctors found anything wrong with them yet?"
美里慵懒地倚在沙发上，深深叹了口气。“真盼着他们快些醒来。失去生命维持后，不知他们是否安好，实在让人心急如焚。医生们有没有查出他们有什么异常？”

"No. They ran MRI scans on the pilots as soon as they could, and didn't see anything worth bringing to my attention. I'd check their reports myself, but I've been busy going over Unit-01 with a fine-toothed comb, looking for any signs of contamination." Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. "If you're that uneasy about them, you could always go check on them yourself."
不，他们一有机会就给飞行员们做了核磁共振扫描，并未发现值得向我汇报的情况。我本想亲自检查他们的报告，但我正忙于仔细检查零号机，以防有任何污染迹象。" 律子挑了挑眉毛，"如果你对他们那么不放心，大可亲自去查看一番。

"Might just do that," replied Misato. She pointed to a relatively new addition to Ritsuko's office. "Need coffee though. Mind if I...?"
我可能真会这么做，" 米萨托回应说。她指了指律子办公室里新添置的一件物品。"但我得来点咖啡。你不介意吧...？

"Sure, go for it." 当然可以，放手去做吧。

After tasting the liquid nuclear energy that Asuka had offered her, Ritsuko had caved a few days later and acquired a coffee machine for her office. Its output wasn't nearly as nerve-searingly powerful, but it did the job far better than a slog down to the cafeteria for a Styrofoam cup of warm brown water that might have been lucky enough to be in the same room as a coffee bean.
品尝过明日香提供的液态核能后，几天过去，律子还是妥协了，为办公室添置了一台咖啡机。尽管它产生的咖啡远不及那种刺激神经的强烈，但比起去食堂买一杯可能只是与咖啡豆擦肩而过的温热棕水，它无疑更胜一筹。

Misato sat back down on the couch, sipping from a steaming cup as she recharged her batteries. "Before I go down there though, do you have any info on how they coped while stuck inside the Angel?"
真嗣再次坐回沙发，小口喝着热腾腾的饮料，给自己充电。“不过在我下去之前，关于他们被困在使徒体内时的情况，你有什么消息吗？”

Ritsuko nodded. "I do, actually. Finished pulling the data from Unit-01's data recorder a few hours ago. Shinji and Asuka were quiet for quite a lot of the time, understandable since they didn't want to waste all their energy, but there were a few conversations." She glanced at her computer screen for a moment, and then smirked. "The last one it picked up may be of... some interest to you."
律子点头道：“确实，我刚在几小时前完成了从初号机数据记录器中提取数据的工作。真嗣和明日香大部分时间保持沉默，这很正常，毕竟他们不想耗尽体力，不过还是进行了几次交谈。”她短暂地看了看电脑屏幕，随后露出一抹意味深长的微笑。“最后记录下来的那段对话，或许你会感兴趣。”

Misato quirked an eyebrow. "Is this one of those 'I can't just tell you' things?"
碇真嗣挑起一边眉毛，问道：“这是那种‘我不能就这么告诉你’的情况吗？”

"Exactly." Ritsuko brought up the file in question and clicked the play button. She then got up to get her own cup of coffee. "Have a listen."
没错。" 律子打开了提到的文件，按下播放键。接着，她站起来去给自己倒咖啡。"听听这个。

Minutes later, Ritsuko had already drained her cup. Misato's still half full cup was hanging loose from her fingers, making the scientist worry she'd spill it all over herself. "Gods..." she muttered, a grin slowly growing on her face. "It's about freaking time!"
几分钟后，律子已将杯中酒一饮而尽。美里手中的杯子半满，却松垮地挂在指间，令科学家不禁担心她会洒一身。“天哪……”她低声道，脸上逐渐绽放出笑容。“真是千呼万唤始出来啊！”

With a whoop that reminded Ritsuko of the venerable Yebisu Can Slam, Misato downed the rest of her coffee and smacked the empty cup into the sofa cushion next to her before practically sprinting out of the office.
美里一声呼喊，让律子联想到经典的三宝乐啤酒罐猛击声，随即她一饮而尽杯中咖啡，将空杯重重拍在旁边的沙发垫上，紧接着便疾步冲出了办公室。

Ritsuko sighed diplomatically as she got up to close the still-open door. "Well," she said to the empty room. "I suppose she's got even more reason not to separate them now."
律子带着外交官般的叹息起身去关那扇依旧敞开的门。“唉，”她对着空荡的房间自言自语，“看来她现在更有理由不让他们分开了。”

His eyes opened, taking in the sterile whiteness above him.
他睁开双眼，映入眼帘的是头顶那片无菌的洁白。

Unfami-...wait, familiar ceiling.
咦，这不是我熟悉的屋顶吗？

Wincing slightly as his gaze briefly shifted towards a light, he set both hands on the mattress and slowly pushed himself up to a sitting position. Once upright she ran a hand through her hair, grumbling at the amount of tangles she could already feel.
他略感不适地皱了皱眉，目光短暂地转向灯光，双手撑在床垫上，缓缓坐起身来。坐直后，她用手梳理着头发，对已经能感受到的打结感到不满。

A curtain surrounded his bed, preventing him from seeing if anyone else was in the room. That wasn't entirely important at the moment, however, as she still needed to work out what had actually happened. The last thing she remembered was sitting in the entry plug, waiting for rescue with-
他的床被帘子环绕，让他看不见房间里是否还有别人。但这会儿并非最紧要的，她得先搞明白到底出了什么事。她最后的印象是坐在插入栓里，一边等待救援，一边...

His face heated up as bits and pieces of memory came back. He'd practically been sitting in her lap. Of course, there were extenuating circumstances and she wasn't about to call him a pervert just because they'd both wanted to try and stay warm, but now they had clearly been rescued and he just knew things were going to be just a bit awkward between them for a while.
他的脸颊不由自主地发热，零碎的记忆逐渐浮现。他几乎坐在了她的腿上。虽然当时情况特殊，她不会因此就指责他，毕竟两人都只是想取暖而已。然而，如今他们已被救出，他预感到两人之间难免会有一段时间的尴尬。

For the life of him, though, she just couldn't recall how they'd been rescued. Had someone jumped in and pulled them out? Did the Angel get bored and just spit them back out into the city? And where was Shinji anyway? Was she in the same room?
尽管如此，她就是记不清他们是如何得救的。是有人跳入水中将他们救起吗？还是天使感到厌倦，直接将他们吐回城市？此外，真嗣又在何处？她是否也在同一房间？

She paused in her musing. Had there been something... odd about that last thought? He went over it again in his mind, but couldn't sense anything out of place. He shook his head, sending red hair scattering about her shoulders. A quick check of the area around the bed showed nothing she was hooked up to, so she swung his legs off the bed and planted his feet on the cold floor.
她中断了沉思，刚才的念头似乎有些……不寻常？他在心中再次审视，却未发现任何异样。她摇了摇头，红色的发丝随之飘散在肩头。快速环顾床边，确认没有连接任何仪器，便将双腿移至床沿，双脚触到了冰凉的地板。

A jolt shot through his head, making him hiss in pain. There was a glass of water on the bedside table, likely tepid, but it was better than nothing. She picked up the glass and drained it in only a few gulps, then sat still for a moment to see if that was enough to deal with how his head was currently feeling. Eventually she decided it wasn't enough and got to her feet. This seemed to be the NERV medical ward, so there had to be an adjacent bathroom where he could get some more water. He raised a hand to move the curtain andwait was that another hand she felt-
一阵剧痛穿透他的头部，令他忍不住发出痛苦的嘶嘶声。床头柜上放着一杯水，或许已经温吞，但聊胜于无。她端起杯子，几大口便一饮而尽，随后静坐片刻，试图判断这能否缓解他此刻的头痛。最终她觉得这还不够，便站起身来。这里应该是 NERV 的医疗区，旁边肯定有卫生间，他可以去那里再取些水。他伸手去拉窗帘，等等，她感觉到的是另一只手吗——

The curtain shifted to one side, and Shinji stared at himself. He blinked in confusion, and saw a mop of red hair framing a puzzled face. Another blink and she was looking into Shinji's' eyes, wondering just what the hell was going on. Before he could begin to ask questions, he heard the sound of a door opening. The curtain was still in the way, so she moved away from the bed into the middle of the room.
窗帘被拉开，真嗣惊讶地看着自己。他困惑地眨眼，眼前是一头红发和一张充满疑惑的脸。再次眨眼，她与真嗣目光交汇，心中满是困惑。在他来得及发问之前，开门声响起。窗帘依旧遮挡视线，她便从床边走到房间中央。

Misato was standing there, looking like she'd been trying to sneak in to check up on them. Upon noticing Shinji, her face broke into a big smile. "Shinji! Asuka! Good to see you two up and about!"
美里站在那儿，似乎正打算偷偷进来关心一下他们。一看到真嗣，她立刻露出了灿烂的笑容。“真嗣！明日香！看到你们俩这么有活力真是太好了！”

Asuka glanced sideways, once again seeing her own face as if she was looking in a mirror. "M-Misato," he haltingly began as his head began throbbing painfully. "I-I think w-we were in t-there too long..."
明日香侧目一瞥，再次映入眼帘的是自己的面容，宛如镜中倒影。“M-美里，”他艰难地开口，头部传来阵阵剧痛。“我-我觉得我们在里面待得太久了……”

An expression of shock replaced the smile on Misato's face. Rather than attempt to placate them, she instead reached for her phone and hit a button. "Rits," she said a few seconds later. "Get down here, we've got a problem with the kids. Looks like they're still synchronised."
葛城美里脸上的笑容被震惊所取代。她并未试图安抚，而是迅速拿起手机，按下一个键。"丽，"几秒后她开口，"快下来，孩子们这边有状况。看来他们还是同步状态。"

It took a surprising amount of effort to deal with Shinji and Asuka. Even physically moving one of them caused the other to react, so in the end a couple of orderlies had to hold onto Shinji while Asuka was shifted into another room. To try and keep this level of synchronisation from returning, the second room's layout was altered such that no piece of furniture was in the same place as the first room.
应对真嗣和明日香竟意外地耗费精力。即便仅是挪动其中一人，另一人也会立即作出反应，最终只得让几位护理员控制住真嗣，同时将明日香转移到另一间房。为避免这种高度同步再次出现，第二间房的布置特意改变，确保无一物件与首间房的位置相同。

A debriefing was required though, while events were still fresh in everybody's mind, which necessitated the two pilots being in the same briefing room the day after they woke up. At this point, while Shinji and Asuka were still highly synchronised, they could at least clearly tell themselves apart. Ritsuko was rather worried about the fact that they had essentially been one mind in two bodies outside of an Evangelion, and blamed it on the subpar entry plug that had also only given them eight hours of life support. That plug had instantly been scrapped once the proper plug had been located.
尽管如此，仍需进行一次简报，确保事件记忆犹新时，两位驾驶员在醒来后的第二天就进入同一简报室。此时，尽管真嗣和明日香仍高度同步，但他们已能清楚区分自我。律子对此深感忧虑，认为他们在外界几乎是一心二体的状态，这归咎于那台劣质的插入栓，它仅提供了八小时的生命维持。一旦找到合适的插入栓，那台劣质的便立即被废弃了。

It was hard to tell if that shorter time limit was a blessing in disguise however, as there was no real way of telling if spending sixteen hours trapped together, even with enhanced filters and safeguards, would have resulted in the same outcome. It might have even been worse.
很难判断那个较短的时间限制是否是隐藏的福音，因为没有确切的方法来确定，即使有强化过滤器和安全保障，十六个小时的共同困顿是否会产生相同的结果。情况甚至可能更糟糕。

"The Human Instrumentality Committee have stated their desire to interview you two on your experience," said Ritsuko as she began the debriefing. "Considering your current state, however, I've managed to convince them that the stress of such an interview would only make your condition worse. They've agreed to make do with a recording of this debriefing as long as I ask the questions they were going to ask."
人类补完委员会原本希望就你们的经历对你们进行面谈，" 律子在汇报开始时说道。"但鉴于你们当前的状态，我已说服他们，面谈的压力只会使情况恶化。他们同意接受这次汇报的录音，条件是我必须提出他们原本计划询问的问题。

"The... who?" Shinji and Asuka both asked.
"The... 谁啊？" 真嗣和明日香异口同声地问道。

"Put simply, they're our boss' bosses," answered Misato. "They're in charge of oversight of NERV."
简而言之，他们是我们的顶头上司，" 美里回答道。"他们负责监管 NERV。

"And trust me, getting interviewed by them is hideously stressful," Ritsuko added. "Anyway, let's begin. Tell us what happened from your perspective, starting from the moment the Angel appeared underneath you."
相信我，接受他们的采访压力山大，" 律子接着说。"好了，我们开始。请从你的视角讲述整个事件，从天使在你下方出现的那一刻说起。

She almost regretted it, as Shinji and Asuka began to speak together. Occasionally one would stop, generally when Shinji or Asuka were speaking of their own thoughts at a certain time, but otherwise they talked in sync. When the two teenagers mentioned responding to something that hadn't actually been said, Misato and Ritsuko glanced concernedly at each other.
她差点后悔，因为真嗣和明日香开始同步交谈。偶尔会有人停顿，通常是在真嗣或明日香表达某个时刻的个人想法时，但大多数时间，他们的对话是同步进行的。当两位少年提到对未曾说过的话做出回应时，美里和律子担忧地交换了一个眼神。

"Think carefully," said Ritsuko, leaning forward slightly. "Was it your own voice, or the voice of each other that you heard, or did it sound like someone else?"
好好想想，" 理佐子身体略微前倾，问道，"你们听到的是自己的声音，还是对方的声音，或者是像其他人的声音？

Finally, there was a small break in the synchronisation. Asuka frowned in concentration, while Shinji simply stared blankly ahead, blinking several times. They glanced at each other; Shinji tilted his head slightly to one side while Asuka's frown deepened. "We're not really sure," they both eventually said, their synchronisation returning. "It sure seemed like our own voices."
最终，同步中出现了一丝小裂痕。明日香皱眉专注，真嗣则茫然地望着前方，眨了几次眼。两人对视一眼，真嗣略微侧头，明日香的眉头皱得更紧了。“我们也不太确定，”他们最终说道，同步再次恢复。“听起来确实像是我们自己的声音。”

Ritsuko leaned back in her seat, a hand rubbing her chin as she pondered the response. The Committee had been concerned that the Angel had drawn Unit-01 into itself to attempt to communicate with the pilots, but the answer she had just been given was ultimately inconclusive. "Think harder," she said. "This is one of the things the Committee wants to know. Did the Angel try to talk to you?"
律子靠在椅背上，一手轻抚下巴，陷入沉思。委员会曾担忧使徒将零号机吸入，意在尝试与驾驶员沟通，然而她刚收到的答复仍无定论。“再仔细想想，”她催促道，“这是委员会急于了解的问题之一。使徒是否曾试图与你对话？”

A pair of glances; a pair of frowns. And then, two shaking heads. "No. It was just us in there. Nothing that could be a third person."
目光交汇，眉头紧锁，随后两人摇头。“不，里面只有我们，不可能有第三者。”

"...Very well, then." ...非常好，那就这样。

"What is the last thing you remember?" Misato asked. "By the time Unit-01 was rescued, you'd been unconscious from oxygen deprivation for a couple of minutes."
你记得的最后一件事是什么？" 葛城美里问道。"零号机获救时，你因缺氧已昏迷数分钟。

"Nothing much," the teenagers said. "Just... sitting around waiting."
没什么特别的，" 青少年们说。"就坐着等呢。

"Short-term memory loss, it seems," Ritsuko mused. "Hopefully that's the only ill effect you suffered."
看来是短期记忆丧失，" 丽萨若有所思地说。"希望你只受到了这一种不良影响。

"So... you don't remember the last thing you said to each other before being rescued?"
那么...你还记得被救之前你们互相说的最后一句话吗？

"Uh... no. Why?" 呃...不，为什么呢？

Shinji and Asuka jumped as Misato slapped the table and cursed. She got up and walked away from the table, running a hand through her hair.
真嗣和明日香因美里猛拍桌子并咒骂而惊跳起来。她起身离开餐桌，边走边用手梳理着头发。

"That's easily fixed, Misato," Ritsuko called after her. "We have the data recorder after all."
这很容易解决，葛城，" 律子在她身后喊道。"我们毕竟有数据记录器。

Misato froze in place for a moment, before spinning around and coming back to the table. "Play it for them," she demanded. "I want them to remember this."
三笠愣了一下，随即转身回到桌边。“放给他们听，”她命令道，“我要他们铭记这一刻。”

Sharing a nervous look, Shinji and Asuka said, "Remember what? What happened?"
真嗣和明日香紧张地对视一眼，问道：“你指的是什么？到底发生了什么事？”

"Right now I'm not sure you'd believe me if I told you," Misato replied with a shake of her head. "You need to hear it from your own mouths, so to speak."
眼下我若直言相告，恐怕你难以置信，" 葛城美里摇头说道，"还是得让你们自己亲耳听闻，这么说吧。

Ritsuko pulled up the relevant audio file on her tablet, pressed play, and placed it on the table between them. As the recording progressed, she watched the faces of Shinji and Asuka. At first, they smiled when Rei was mentioned, but that soon faded as Shinji spoke of having no regrets. And then... some unmistakable sounds that sent blood rushing to both their faces.
律子在平板电脑上调出相关音频文件，按下播放键后放在两人中间的桌上。录音播放时，她留意着真嗣和明日香的神情。起初，提及绫波时他们还露出微笑，但当真嗣表示无悔时，笑容迅速消退。随后...一些清晰可辨的声音令两人的脸颊都泛起了红晕。

They were no longer in sync. Shinji was shell-shocked, staring at the tablet with wide eyes, while Asuka had a hand over her mouth in shock as she glanced sideways at him. Before anybody could speak, she got up and practically ran from the room. Shinji didn't seem to notice, even when the door slammed open as she made her escape.
他们之间已不再同步。真嗣目瞪口呆，双眼圆睁地盯着平板，而明日香则一手捂嘴，震惊之余侧目瞥向他。未等旁人开口，她便起身疾步离开了房间。真嗣对此浑然不觉，就连她逃离时门重重关上的声音也未能引起他的注意。

Misato got up and chased after her, leaving Ritsuko to groan in annoyance. The debriefing wasn't over yet, even if the most critical bit of information was already acquired. She picked the tablet up and stopped the recording, taking the time to jot down some notes. The room was silent for several minutes until Shinji finally spoke.
三笠起身追赶，留下律子恼火地叹息。虽然最关键的信息已到手，简报却尚未结束。她拾起平板，暂停录音，趁机记下要点。房间内沉寂良久，最终真嗣打破了沉默。

"I... shouldn't have said anything," he mumbled. "Should've just kept my stupid mouth shut and waited..."
我... 真不该开口，" 他低声自语。"本该管住这张笨嘴，耐心等待...

Ritsuko looked up from the tablet and sighed. "I'm not a therapist, Shinji. I don't know what to say."
律子从平板电脑上抬起头，叹息道：“真嗣，我不是心理咨询师，真不知道该对你说什么好。”

"...Sorry." Shinji turned his head away to stare at the wall.
"...抱歉。" 真嗣别过头，目光落在墙上。

"Not... what I meant," Ritsuko hurriedly said. "You thought you were about to die and decided to confess your feelings. Nothing wrong with that."
不，我不是那个意思，" 律子连忙解释。"你当时以为自己命不久矣，才选择表白心迹。这很正常，没什么不妥。

"But... I've ruined our friendship. Asuka obviously doesn't feel the same way if she ran out of the room like that." Shinji sighed and hung his head. "She probably hates me now."
但是...我破坏了我们的友情。明日香那样跑出房间，显然她并没有相同的感受。" 真嗣叹息着，低下了头。"她现在大概很讨厌我吧。

Ritsuko put the tablet down and rubbed her forehead. "Shinji... I'm not at liberty to divulge details about Asuka, but I can say this: it's just... complicated for her."
律子放下手中的平板，轻揉着额头。“真嗣，关于明日香，我无法详谈，只能说她的处境颇为复杂。”

Shinji glanced up at her and gave an unamused huff. "Nothing complicated here. She's not interested in me, not that I can blame her."
真嗣抬头瞥了她一眼，不满地哼了一声。“事情很简单，她对我没兴趣，我也没什么好抱怨的。”

Standing up and adjusting her lab coat, Ritsuko decided she had no desire to sit around listening to self-deprecation. There was nothing more to be gained from this debriefing, and the Committee would likely be calling again soon. "Just... head back to your room for now. Give Asuka some time to come to grips with what happened before... writing yourself off."
律子站起身，整理了一下实验服，决定不再坐听自我贬低。这次汇报已无更多收获，委员会不久后可能还会召集。“先回房间吧。给明日香点时间消化发生的事，之后再……别急着否定自己。”

"...Yes, Doctor." 是的，医生。

It was all she could think of to say to try and keep him from slipping into depression, and Ritsuko couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy as the distraught young man slouched out of the room. After all, she knew rather well how it felt to desire somebody and not have those feelings returned.
她绞尽脑汁，只想出这些话来防止他陷入抑郁，看着那位心烦意乱的年轻人颓然离开房间，律子忍不住心生同情。毕竟，她深知单恋无果的滋味。

Asuka's path was rather obvious; all Misato had to do was follow the trail of affronted personnel, including one person who was now picking papers up off the floor. The other people helpfully pointed out which way Asuka had run, until Misato came to a bathroom door that had yet to swing fully closed. She pushed it open and went inside, noting the dent in the wall where the handle had impacted it, then picked a stall entirely at random and sat down on the toilet seat, and proceeded to wait.
明日香的行踪一目了然；美里只需循着那些面露不悦的人员的踪迹，其中一位正弯腰拾起散落的文件。旁人热心地指明了明日香逃走的方向，直至美里来到一扇半掩的洗手间门前。她推门而入，留意到门把手在墙上留下的凹痕，随后随意选了一间隔间，坐在马桶上，静静等待。

And wait. 然后等待。

And wait some more. 继续等待。

Ten minutes passed before a quiet voice from the next stall over said, "You're just going to sit there until I talk aren't you?"
十分钟后，隔壁隔间才响起一个平静的声音：“你是打算一直坐着，等我先开口吧？”

"Yep," Misato immediately replied with a grin.
"嗯，" 碇真嗣立刻笑着回应道。

Asuka gave a disgruntled groan. "Fine," she acidly said. "Let's just get this over with. You know why I can't accept Shinji's confession."
明日香不满地哼了一声。“行吧，”她语气尖刻，“赶紧把这事了结了。你知道我无法接受真嗣的表白。”

Misato closed her eyes. "So you're going to shatter the heart of your best friend because of something that happened a long time ago, something entirely out of your control."
真嗣闭上眼睛，说道：“就因为很久以前一件你无法掌控的事，你就要摧毁你最好朋友的心吗？”

"He's strong, he'll get over it," was the blunt reply.
"他身体强壮，会挺过去的。"这是那句直截了当的回答。

"Are you so sure of that?" she shot back. "I can guarantee you that right now Shinji is still sitting in that briefing room, beating himself up over ruining your friendship and thinking that you hate him."
你这么肯定吗？" 她反驳道，"我敢保证，真嗣此刻还在简报室里，因为破坏了你们的友情而自责，以为你恨他。

"...He'll get over it," Asuka repeated. "He'll find someone else."
...他会挺过去的，" 明日香再次说道。"他会找到别人的。

Misato rolled her eyes. "That boy worships you, Asuka. He doesn't even spend much time with those two friends of his in your class, because he'd rather be with you. And I know for a fact that he's not simply hoping to hit it and quit it."
美里翻了翻白眼，说道：“那小子对你可是崇拜得五体投地，明日香。他连你们班那两个朋友都很少搭理，一心只想和你待在一起。我敢打包票，他绝不是那种玩玩就算的人。”

The innuendo caused a loud splutter of surprise that brought a smile back to Misato's face. "I'm serious. It's not just puppy love or teenage hormones. Shinji is head over heels for you. And I've seen the way you sometimes look at him when he's not paying attention. Don't try and tell me you don't feel at least some romantic affection for him."
那句含沙射影的话引发了一阵响亮的惊呼，让惣流·明日香·兰格雷的脸上再次绽放出笑容。"我是认真的。这不仅仅是青涩的初恋或青春期的荷尔蒙冲动。碇真嗣对你可是情根深种。而且我留意到，有时候在他不经意间，你凝视他的眼神。别否认，你对他的感情里没有一丝浪漫的成分。"

Silence returned to the bathroom for a long, tense moment. "I... I can't do it again," Asuka finally mumbled.
浴室再次陷入长久的沉默，气氛紧张。"我...我不能再这样了," 明日香终于喃喃自语。

"Do what?" Misato pressed.
"做什么？" 碇真嗣紧跟着追问。

"Can't... let myself get hurt again."
不能再让自己受伤了。

"How can you be so sure that'll happen? Shinji isn't the type to dump you and run off with someone else."
你怎么能这么肯定会有那种事？真嗣不是那种会甩了你跟别人跑的人。

"Maybe not, but... that's not all that could happen." Asuka's voice was starting to waver. "Look at what happened to... to Mama."
或许并非如此，但...可能发生的不止这些。" 明日香的声音开始颤抖。"看看妈妈...她遭遇了什么。

"Lots of things could happen to any of us," Misato reasoned. "Is that any reason to not enjoy every moment you have? To not grab the opportunity for happiness and hold onto it with both hands? Do you think I got to where I am now by shying away from everything?"
很多事情都可能降临到我们任何人身上，" 碇真嗣深思道。"难道这就能成为我们不珍惜当下、不抓住幸福机会的理由吗？你以为我是靠逃避一切才达到现在的成就吗？

"We're Eva pilots though," said Asuka. "What happens if one of us gets killed by an Angel?"
尽管我们是 Eva 的驾驶员，"明日香担忧地说，"万一我们之中有人被使徒杀害，那该如何是好？

"These are dangerous times for everybody. If I had the chance, I'd rather be with that special person and cherish the time I have with them, rather than shove them away and be miserable for the rest of my life just because they might disappear one day."
当前时期对每个人而言都充满风险。若有机会，我更愿与心爱之人相伴，珍惜相处的每一刻，而非因害怕终将失去而将他们拒之门外，让余生沉浸在无尽的悲伤中。

Misato sighed and rubbed her eyes while silence reigned yet again. She could just imagine Asuka sitting on her seat, hugging her knees to her chest and struggling to come up with more excuses. "Look, you two are amazing when you work together. Seeing you and Shinji synchronised, it's like you're already a couple, reading each other's mind and such. If you took this next step and let yourself be loved again, not only would you be happier, I'm sure you'd be absolutely unbeatable no matter what obstacle you faced."
美里叹了口气，揉揉眼睛，四周再次陷入沉寂。她能想象到明日香坐在座位上，双臂环抱膝盖，正绞尽脑汁找借口。“听着，你们俩合作起来真是天衣无缝。看到你和真嗣同步的样子，仿佛你们已是心有灵犀的情侣。如果你们能勇敢迈出这一步，再次接受爱的温暖，我相信，无论遇到什么困难，你们都将无往不胜。”

"I... I..." 我... 我...

Misato sighed and got up, opening the stall and stepping out. "I know you're afraid of starting a relationship, but please... at least don't destroy your friendship just because of that fear."
美里叹息着起身，推开隔间门迈步而出。“我明白你对开始恋情心存畏惧，但至少别让这份恐惧毁了你们的友情。”

"...What do you want from me?"
...你到底想要我做什么？

"I'd like foryou to go back to that briefing room and tell Shinji exactly how you feel. I'll settle for you putting his mind at ease and confirming you're still friends."
我希望你能回到简报室，向真嗣坦诚表达你的感受。你只需让他放心，确认你们友情依旧。

Misato spent a minute checking her hair in the mirror before Asuka came out of her stall, right hand clutching her left elbow. She looked so... small, shrunken in on herself.
在明日香走出隔间前，美里对着镜子仔细整理了一分钟的头发。她显得格外瘦小，仿佛蜷缩成一团。

"You're... not gonna tell him about this, are you?" she nervously whispered.
"你不会...把这事告诉他吧？" 她紧张兮兮地低语。

Misato emphatically shook her head. "No, your feelings are just between us girls. It's not my place to tell him."
真嗣坚定地摇了摇头。“不行，你的心事只属于我们女生之间的秘密。我无权向他透露。”

The walk back to the briefing room felt as tense as an imminent Angel battle, but Asuka did not falter for a second. She strode back into the room, marched up to Shinji -who stood up in surprise at her sudden entrance- and put her arms around him for a few seconds. Misato didn't hear what was said, but she saw Shinji nod in something akin to relief. He didn't look ecstatic, but neither was he still morose.
返回简报室的路上，气氛紧张得仿佛即将爆发的天使之战，然而明日香毫不迟疑。她昂首阔步地走进房间，直奔惊讶站起的真嗣，并紧紧拥抱了他片刻。美里虽未听见他们的对话，却目睹真嗣点头时露出的释然表情。他并未欣喜若狂，但也不再显得忧郁。

And for now, Misato could accept that.
目前，真嗣能够接受这一点。

XXX

"-ndition?" 什么条件？

"She's sta- ... -ore days be- ... ing her go h-"
她已经在商店里度过了好几天，现在该让她回家了。

Rei's head felt like her brain was desperately attempting to escape from her skull. Her entire body felt leaden; she couldn't even so much as twitch a finger. The familiar sensation of liquid on her skin told her exactly where she was, even if she couldn't summon the energy to open her eyes. All she could do was float limply in her tube in the depths of Central Dogma.
绫的头部仿佛大脑正拼命试图挣脱头骨的束缚。她全身沉重，连动动手指的力气都没有。皮肤上熟悉的液体触感让她清楚地意识到自己的所在，即便她无力睁眼。此刻，她只能无力地漂浮在中央教条深处的管中。

The voices nearby continued, muffled by LCL, the glass tube, and Rei's own tired mind. The only reason she knew who was talking was because only three people had access to this place, and the third one never needed to be here.
周围的交谈声依旧持续，被 LCL、玻璃管以及绫波自身的疲惫思绪所掩盖。她能分辨出说话者，全因仅有三人有权进入此地，而第三人从未必要到场。

"-ny idea- ... -pened?" -ny 想法- ... -pened?

"As bes- ... -drew upon Li- ... -it-01 out of the-"
正如贝斯- ... -德鲁降临，李- ... -它-01 从-

"Fooli- ... -dered- ... -unless there wa- ... -he scenario."
除非存在某种情况，否则不会考虑这种愚昧的...行为。

"If- ... -erge with Unit- ... -oken into Term-"
如果-...-与单位合并-...-被纳入期限-

Rei cast her mind back, searching for clarification. The Angel. Unit-01, trapped. Bwynvienne. Rescue attempt. Ah, she had... done something forbidden in order to save the lives of Shinji and Asuka. As was to be expected, her body had suffered from being a conduit and now she was down here to recover in secrecy.
绫波丽追溯记忆，试图理清思绪。那个使徒。初号机，陷入困境。布温维尼恩。救援行动。啊，她为了救出真嗣和明日香，不惜触犯禁忌。果不其然，她的身体因充当媒介而遭受重创，如今她正秘密在此休养。

Commander Ikari was likely displeased with her. But was it enough to activate the next one? Or would she be permitted to continue with this current mind and body?
伊卡里指挥官很可能对她感到不满。但这种不满是否足以启动下一个替代者？还是她能继续保持现有的身心状态？

"-e infor-" -e 资讯-

"Yes, Comm-" 是的，通信-

Muffled footsteps denoted the exit of one person, while the sound of heels on metal flooring came closer.
沉闷的脚步声暗示着某人的离去，与此同时，高跟鞋敲击金属地面的声响逐渐逼近。

"This better not become a habit, Rei." The voice, female and unhappy, was just outside her tube, letting her hear more clearly. "It's a good thing you were wearing a plugsuit, because otherwise there would have been no way to disguise the fact that your body was starting to melt."
零，这可别成了你的习惯。"那女声带着不悦，就在她的舱外，声音清晰可闻。"还好你穿了插入栓服，不然你身体开始融化的迹象就无处可藏了。

Yes, a very good thing; Rei didn't want her friends to see her like that. They already knew she was... not exactly like them. Yet despite all the time they'd spent together, neither of them had even considered trying to pry further into her background, choosing instead to treat her as just another person. Falling apart in front of Shinji and Asuka would have likely traumatised them, even if she would be back with them a few days later in a new body. Questions would be asked, and as much as she might have liked to give answers, orders such as these could not be disobeyed. More lives than her own would be at stake.
确实，这再好不过了；绫波不愿让朋友们见到自己那副模样。他们虽知她与众不同，但即便共度时光，也未曾试图深究其过往，只将她当作普通人对待。若在真嗣和明日香面前崩溃，恐怕会给他们留下心理阴影，即便她数日后便能以新躯体归来。届时，疑问必生，她虽愿坦诚相告，但军令如山，违抗不得。牵涉的，远不止她一人的安危。

"The Commander's pretty unhappy, by the way. If you don't want to get replaced I'd watch myself if I were you."
顺便提一下，指挥官现在很不高兴。如果你不想被换掉，我劝你还是谨慎些为好。

As she expected. It was almost guaranteed she would be standing in front of the Commander's desk the moment she could walk unassisted.
不出所料，她几乎可以肯定，一旦能独立行走，就会立刻站在指挥官的办公桌前。

"Oh, Shinji and Asuka are... well I suppose they're fine. Some synchronisation issues but a sudden shock knocked them out of it. Although now they're going to get teenage angst all over the place. At least you don't have to worry about that for a few days, maybe it'll have blown over by the time you can go home."
哦，真嗣和明日香的情况……嗯，应该还算可以。之前有些同步问题，但一次突如其来的冲击让他们恢复了。只是现在他们可能会把青春期的情绪带到各处。好在接下来几天你不用为此操心，说不定等你回家时，这些情绪已经平息了。

The corners of Rei's mouth turned up fractionally.
零的嘴角略微上翘。

"...I can see you smiling in there," Doctor Akagi remarked. "I just wonder if your friendship with the other pilots will affect your motivation when it's time for the endgame."
...我能看见你在里面微笑，" 秋吉医生说。"我只是在想，你与其他飞行员的友情会不会影响到你面对最终决战时的斗志。

'No,' Rei thought, the faint smile vanishing as quickly as it had appeared. 'Not even friendship will stay my hand when it comes time for me to play my part.'
'不，' 雷伊暗想，那抹微笑一闪即逝。'到了我该行动的时候，即便是友谊也无法让我停手。'

XXX

Shinji was almost, almost, thankful for the fact that he and Asuka had separate hospital rooms after the embarrassment he had inflicted on himself. On the one hand, it was helping to ensure their involuntary synchronisation didn't return, and he wouldn't have to face the person he'd also embarrassed.
真嗣几乎要感谢他和明日香在医院拥有各自的房间，毕竟他刚经历了那场尴尬。这样一来，不仅能防止他们非自愿的同步再次发生，他也无需面对那个同样令他尴尬的人。

On the other hand... he was already starting to miss Asuka.
另一方面……他已经开始怀念明日香了。

He couldn't actually be sure she was avoiding him, but it certainly seemed like it. It had been a couple of days since the briefing room incident and Shinji had not seen so much as a glimpse of her hair during his wanderings around the medical wing and cafeteria.
他其实无法确定她是否在故意回避，但情况看起来确实如此。自从简报室那次事件后，已经好几天了，真嗣在医疗区和食堂附近游荡时，连她的影子都没见到。

But now, on the way to the cafeteria to get something to eat and most definitely not search for Asuka, he ran into somebody else.
然而此刻，他正前往食堂觅食，绝非为了寻找明日香，却偶遇了另一个人。

"Yo, Shin-man!" 哟，新哥！

A hand slapped down on Shinji's back, almost sending him sprawling across the corridor floor. He quickly recovered and straightened up to looking into the grinning face of Toji Suzuhara.
一只手猛地拍在真嗣背上，差点让他扑倒在走廊。他迅速稳住身形，挺直腰杆，迎上了冢原土依那张满是笑意的脸。

"Oh, hello Toji," he greeted. "What are you doing here?"
哦，你好，冬二，"他招呼道。"你怎么在这儿？

Toji pointed somewhere over Shinji's shoulder. "Visitin' my little sis, of course! Dontcha remember Ken got 'er transferred here?"
透治指向真嗣身后某处，说道：“当然是去看我妹妹了！你忘了是肯让她转学过来的吗？”

A flash of guilt shot through Shinji before he could stifle it. If his friend noticed anything, he didn't draw attention to it. "Oh right," he lamely replied. "Um... how is she doing?"
真嗣心头掠过一丝内疚，还未来得及掩饰。若朋友有所察觉，也未曾表露。“哦，对了，”他含糊地应道，“那个……她还好吗？”

"Hell of a lot better now that she's here," said Toji. "Hisae's been doin' rehab for a few weeks now. It's slow goin', of course, what with the bones in her leg bein' half turned to powder, but she ain't letting that stop her." He thumped a hand on his chest over his heart. "Us Suzuharas are tough, and we ain't afraid o' hard work!"
她一来，情况好多了。" 透治说道，"久惠已经做了几周的康复训练。当然进展缓慢，毕竟她腿骨几乎碎成了粉末，但她并未因此止步。" 他用手拍了拍胸口，"我们铃原家的人都很坚韧，从不畏惧辛劳！

Shinji quirked an eyebrow. "So why are you always slacking off in class?"
真嗣挑眉问道：“你为什么老是在课堂上偷懒？”

"Oi!" Toji glared at him, but there was no true anger in it. "You try focusin' on your work when that old fossil is tryin' ta put us all to sleep!"
喂！" Toji 瞪了他一眼，但并无真怒。"你试试看，那个老古董一开口就想让人打瞌睡，这种情况下你还能不能专心工作！

Shinji chuckled in agreement. "A while ago I wondered if he's secretly an Angel, considering how he's able to put entire classrooms of teenagers to sleep."
真嗣笑着附和道：“之前我还真怀疑过他是不是暗中是个使徒，看他那本事，能让一屋子的青少年都睡过去。”

Toji snorted into his hand, then shook his head in amusement. "Yeah, wouldn't surprise me."
透二哼了一声，用手掩口，随后笑着摇了摇头。“嗯，这倒不奇怪。”

"Mister Suzuhara?" 铃原先生？

The two teenagers turned to see a nurse approaching them, one that looked vaguely familiar to Shinji. It was possible he'd spent too much time in NERV's medical wing.
两位少年回头一看，一位护士正向他们走来，真嗣觉得她似曾相识。或许是因为他在 NERV 的医疗部门待的时间太长了。

"Oh hey," said Toji. "Nurse... Himiko right?"
哦，嘿，"托吉说，"你是护士姬子，对吧？

The nurse nodded. "That's right. Are you here to see Hisae? She's doing her physical therapy at the moment if you'd like to watch and give moral support."
护士点头道：“对，您是来看 Hisae 的吧？她正在做物理治疗，您可以旁观，给她一些鼓励。”

"Yeah, I'm just on my way there now." Toji hooked a thumb at Shinji. "Alright if my friend tags along? Hisae's been asking to see him for a while."
对，我现在正要去那儿。" 东治用拇指示意了一下真嗣。"我朋友能一块儿来吗？他的朋友已经想见他很久了。

"Of course," replied Himiko, before looking at Shinji. "It's good to see you up and about again, Mister Ikari," she said, giving him a bright smile.
"当然，" 希美子回答后，转向真嗣。"看到你恢复活力真是太好了，碇先生，" 她露出灿烂的笑容说道。

"Um, thanks," he said, to which Himiko gave a little bow before heading off down the corridor. Glancing at Toji, he asked, "Is that true? That your sister's asking about me?"
嗯，谢谢，"他开口道，Himiko 听后微微鞠躬，随即沿着走廊离去。他转向 Toji，好奇地问："你妹妹真的在问起我吗？

"'Course it's true!" Toji replied with a massive grin. "She wants ta see the hero pilot that saved the city, not to mention her life!"
那当然是真的！" 东治笑着回答，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容。"她想见的是那位拯救了城市，更别提还救了她一命的英雄飞行员！

"But I was-" Shinji abruptly cut himself off. If Asuka were here, she would have most likely just elbowed him to shut up and then gone on about the circumstances, ending in some variant of 'it wasn't your fault'.
"但我刚要说——" 真嗣突然停了下来。若明日香在场，她很可能直接用胳膊肘顶他一下让他住口，接着分析情况，最终以某种形式的“这不是你的错”收尾。

"C'mon," said Toji, patting Shinji's shoulder non-too-gently. "Let's get goin'."
来吧，"托吉说着，不太温柔地拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。"咱们走吧。

Shinji nodded, and followed the older boy through the medical wing until they arrived at the door to the physical therapy room. Out of nowhere, Toji put out a hand to stop him.
真嗣点头后，跟着那位年长的男孩穿过医疗区，直至抵达理疗室的门口。毫无预兆地，东治伸手拦住了他。

"Since yer girlfriend ain't here," he said with a stern expression on his face, "I'm gonna say it for 'er. No puttin' yerself down about what happened. Yer the reason me 'n her are alive today." Shinji barely had time to deal with his face flushing at that word before Toji continued, his face softening up. "Oh, and... ya mind waitin' out here fer just a sec? I kinda wanna surprise Hisae."
既然你女朋友不在场，" 他严肃地说，"我就代她说了。别再自责了。是你让我们俩今天得以幸存。" 真嗣还来不及因那个词而脸红，东治就继续说，表情变得柔和。"哦，还有... 你介意在外面稍等片刻吗？我想给久世一个惊喜。

Nodding at the request, Shinji waited next to the door as his friend went in. The first thing he heard was a girl's voice cry out, "Tooojjjiiiiiiii!"
点头答应请求后，真嗣在门边等候，看着朋友进入房间。他首先听到的是一个女孩高声呼唤：“东治！”

"'Ey sis, how's yer therapy goin'?"
嘿，姐妹，你的治疗怎么样了？

"Good, Big Bro! They say I only need a couple more months at most before I'm good as new!"
好的，大哥！听说我最多再过几个月就能恢复如初了！

That response brought a smile to Shinji's face. Ignoring whether or not her injury was his fault, Hisae didn't deserve to be shut up in a hospital for months because of the Angels. Thinking back, he wondered if she would have been fully healed already if NERV had taken her in immediately after the attack instead of leaving her to be dealt with by an under-funded public hospital.
那个回答让真嗣露出了微笑。无论她的伤是否因他而起，Hisae 都不该因使徒而困于医院数月。回想起来，他不禁思索，若 NERV 在袭击后即刻接收她，而非让她留在资金匮乏的公立医院，她或许早已痊愈。

A knock on the wall behind his head shook Shinji out of his musing, and he took that as the signal to join them. Stepping into the room, he noted that it looked a lot like a gym; something which he supposed made sense. There was no time to check the area out, however. A young girl was limping across the room towards him at a surprising rate of speed, a very worried looking nurse trailing in her wake.
他头后的墙壁突然响起敲击声，打断了真嗣的沉思，他明白这是加入他们的信号。走进房间，他发现这里酷似体育馆，心想这倒也合情合理。然而，他来不及细看四周。只见一个年轻女孩一瘸一拐地快速向他走来，身后跟着一位神情焦急的护士。

Bracing himself as if he were facing a charging Angel, Shinji managed to stay upright as Hisae Suzuhara greeted him by cannoning into his stomach and hugging him. Shinji instinctively put his arms around her, cognisant of her still-healing leg. It wouldn't do for her to fall over now.
真嗣如同面对冲锋的天使般稳住身形，当铃原寿美江猛地撞进他的怀里并紧紧拥抱时，他本能地环抱住她，心中明白她的腿伤尚未痊愈。此刻，她绝不能跌倒。

"Hiiiiiii Mistah Ikari!" Hisae practically shouted, hitting him with a megawatt smile so infectious Shinji had no chance of stopping his own face returning it. "Thanks fer savin' me an' Big Bro from that nasty Angel!"
嗨，伊卡里先生！" 久世几乎是大声喊出来的，她那灿烂的笑容如此具有感染力，让真嗣不由自主地也回以微笑。"多亏你救了我和哥哥，让我们免受那恶魔天使的伤害！

There was that flash of guilt again, but the sheer joy emanating from this exuberant young girl vaporised it. "Uh... y-you're welcome," he stammered. "Things... um... could have gone better but I'm just happy you two made it out mostly intact."
内疚感再次掠过心头，然而这位充满活力的少女所洋溢的纯真喜悦瞬间将其驱散。"呃...不-不客气，"他有些口吃地说。"事情...嗯...原本可能更糟，但我很高兴你们俩大体上平安无事。"

Toji, standing behind Hisae, gave him an approving nod.
東寺站在久世身後，向他點頭表示贊許。

"Miss Suzuhara," said the nurse as she stepped up beside the girl. "The therapy session isn't over yet. You can talk with your brother and friend while you go through the routines."
Suzuhara 小姐，"护士走到女孩身边说，"治疗还没结束呢。你可以在做这些常规动作的同时，和你的哥哥还有朋友聊聊天。

"Oh fine." Hisae pouted, her cheeks puffing up adorably, as she turned and followed the nurse back to a set of parallel bars.
"哦，好吧。" Hisae 噘起嘴，脸颊鼓鼓的，显得十分可爱，她转身跟随护士走向了一组平行杠。

Still somewhat stunned, it took Toji walking up and delivering another back slap to knock Shinji out of his stupor. "She gets everyone like that the first time," said Toji. "Man, when she grows up I'm gonna have to keep a big metal bat in the house. An' no offense, Shin-man, but if Hisae were around our age I'd be pointin' that bat at you too."
真嗣依旧有些恍惚，直到东治上前又拍了拍他的背，才让他回过神来。"她初次见面总是让人这样，"东治说道，"等她长大些，我得在家里备一根大铁棒。真嗣，别介意，但若比佐惠和我们同岁，我可能也会用那根棒子防着你。"

"You sure?" Shinji bemusedly asked. "Going by what I've heard from Kensuke, she'd be the one holding the bat."
你确定？" 真嗣疑惑地问，"听健介说，她才是那个拿球棒的人。

Toji threw his head back and laughed. "Damn right she would!"
东地仰头大笑，道：“她肯定会这么说！”

Shinji sat down on a chair next to his friend and, with a lightened heart, watched an innocent victim of the Angel War continue on her road to recovery.
真嗣在朋友旁边的椅子上坐下，心情释然地注视着一位天使战争的无辜受害者，她正继续迈向康复之路。

### Chapter 32 You're Joking, Right?

The last thing Misato wanted was to be roused from bed two hours after falling into it, on a Saturday night, but the insistently ringing phone refused to disintegrate no matter how hard she glared at it. With something just shy of a frustrated shout, she flopped out a hand to grab the phone and flip it open.
美里最不希望的就是在周六晚上刚睡下两小时就被吵醒，然而那部响个不停的手机，无论她怎么瞪眼，就是不肯消停。她几乎要发出一声懊恼的喊叫，伸手抓起手机，翻开盖子。

"What?" 什么？

If the person on the other side of the line had any sympathy for the rude awakening, it didn't come across in their voice.
电话那头的人若对这突如其来的粗鲁唤醒抱有同情，其声音中也未显露分毫。

"You're needed back here ASAP, Major," said Lieutenant Hyuga.
少校，海格中尉说：'您得赶紧回来。'

"Is it an Angel?" 这是天使吗？

"No, an incident at NERV-Nevada."
不，是 NERV 位于内华达的基地发生了一起事件。

"An 'incident'?" she repeated.
"一个'事故'？"她重复道。

"That's as best as I can describe it over the phone."
我通过电话只能描述到这个程度了。

"Damnit. Fine, I'm on my way."
真烦人。行吧，我马上到。

Misato was thankful that Asuka made sure there was a cup of her coffee machine's magic brew in the fridge. While it didn't taste quite as good after being reheated, it was still a vital pick-me-up for sudden call-ins like this. The cup slowly spun in the microwave as she threw her uniform back on, and she made it back to the kitchen just in time to stop the appliance from loudly beeping. She left the cup on the sink to cool down just a tad while she finished adjusting her clothing; the last thing she needed was to melt her tongue while driving.
真嗣对明日香确保冰箱里有她咖啡机中的神奇咖啡心存感激。尽管重新加热后口感略逊，但面对这种突如其来的召唤，它仍是不可或缺的提神良品。当她匆忙穿上制服时，杯子在微波炉中缓缓旋转，她恰好在微波炉发出响亮提示音前赶回厨房。她将杯子置于水槽上稍作冷却，同时整理衣装；她可不想在驾车时烫伤舌头。

At this time of night the streets were relatively quiet. However, anyone who had suffered through Misato's driving habits would have keeled over in shock at the sight of her simply speeding along instead of driving like an utter lunatic. The main gate into NERV had just finished opening by the time Misato reached it, and she returned the gate guard's wave as she continued inside. Once the Renault was locked into the car elevator, she relaxed in her seat for a minute to enjoy the coffee.
夜深人静，街道上人车稀少。但凡见识过美里驾驶风格的人，若见她此刻仅是平稳加速而非疯狂飙车，定会惊愕不已。美里抵达时，NERV 总部的大门恰好完全开启，她向门卫挥手后驶入。待雷诺车稳妥地进入电梯，她便在座位上稍作歇息，品味着咖啡的香醇。

She finally reached the briefing room, twenty minutes after getting the call. Inside it was almost completely dark, lit only by the holographic projector embedded in the floor. Ritsuko was already there, as were the three bridge lieutenants.
接到电话二十分钟后，她终于抵达简报室。室内几乎一片漆黑，仅靠地板上嵌入的全息投影仪照明。律子已到场，三位舰桥中尉也在。

"Good, you're here," said Ritsuko, before pointing at the screen. "Take a look."
很好，你到了，" 理津子说着，指向屏幕，"看看这个。

A satellite image of the NERV base in Nevada appeared, with a timer counting down. The very second it hit zero, there was a shockwave emanating from the base followed by a circle of red. Six seconds later, the video cut out. The view changed, showing a massive crater where the base used to be.
一张显示 NERV 位于内华达州的基地的卫星图像上，有一个倒计时正在运行。当计时器归零的瞬间，基地爆发出一阵冲击波，紧接着出现了一个红色的圆圈。六秒后，视频信号突然中断。随后画面切换，展示出原本基地所在之处已变成一个巨大的陨石坑。

"What the hell..." Misato breathed, the coffee turning to ash in her mouth.
"这到底是怎么回事..." 三佐喘着气，嘴里的咖啡仿佛变成了灰烬。

"We've lost Unit-04 and the entire Nevada branch," said Makoto. "All that's left is a crater, eighty-nine kilometres wide."
我们失去了 Unit-04 以及整个内华达分部，" Makoto 说道。"现在只剩下一个直径达八十九公里的巨坑。

Shigeru nodded darkly. "Thousands of people... gone in a few seconds."
志賀沉重地点了点头。"成千上万的人...顷刻间便不复存在。"

"According to their schedule," said Maya, clearly unnerved by what was on the screen, judging by how she held the tablet in front of her face, "They were working on installing the prototype S2 Engine Germany had just sent them. There are almost thirty-three thousand potential causes, such as structural integrity problems or calculation errors."
根据他们的日程，"玛雅说道，显然屏幕上的内容让她感到不安，从她将平板电脑挡在面前的动作就能看出，"他们正在安装德国刚寄来的 S2 引擎原型。可能的问题原因多达三万三千种，包括结构完整性问题或计算错误。

"And then of course there's the possibility that someone sabotaged it," Misato interjected.
"当然，也不能排除有人蓄意破坏的可能性，" 碇真嗣插话道。

"True," replied Ritsuko. "Although why would somebody do that?"
确实如此，" 里津子回应说。"可究竟为何有人会这么做呢？

Misato shrugged. "Maybe it was a disgruntled employee hoping to break things so nothing happened. Instead he ends up destroying the entire base."
真嗣耸了耸肩。“可能是某个不满的员工，本想搞点破坏让事情泡汤。没想到最后却毁掉了整个基地。”

"It wasn't an explosion though," said Ritsuko, pointing down at the screen where the video footage was replaying. "While there was a shockwave as we can see here, and a big chunk carved out of the landscape, it was a Dirac Sea that swallowed the branch."
尽管发生了爆炸，" Ritsuko 指着屏幕上正在重播的视频片段说，"正如我们在这里看到的冲击波和地形上的一大块被挖掉，但实际上是狄拉克之海吞没了分支。

"Dirac Sea?" Misato's head reared back slightly in puzzlement. "What's that?"
"狄拉克海是什么？" 三佐略显困惑地微微仰头问道。

"...Ah, you might not have been paying attention when I mentioned the concept before. Anyway, the Twelfth Angel's true body was a Dirac Sea. You could essentially call it 'imaginary space', or a pocket dimension. After all, how could an Evangelion fit into something that's only three nanometres thick?"
...啊，或许你之前没留意我提过的这个概念。简单来说，第十二使徒的本体是狄拉克之海，你可以把它看作是一种‘虚构空间’，或者说是一个微型维度。试想，一个福音战士怎么可能被塞进仅有三纳米厚度的空间里呢？

"And the Nevada Branch disappeared into this Dirac Sea as well?" Misato asked, instantly suspicious. "Does that mean the Angel isn't really dead?"
这么说，内华达分部也融入了这个狄拉克海？" 葛城美里立刻警觉起来。"难道这意味着使徒并未真正消亡？

"Oh no, I'm quite sure it is dead," Ritsuko clarified. "Whatever happened at Nevada simply created its own dimensional tear."
哦不，我确信它已经死了，" 律子明确表示。"内华达州的事件只是引发了自身的维度裂缝。

"And it collapsed immediately afterwards," Shigeru remarked. "Meaning everything in it is forever lost to us."
随后它立刻崩塌了，" 志賀说道。"这意味着里面的东西永远与我们无缘了。

"Which means we no longer have the S2 Engine that was supposed to relieve us of our Evangelion power woes." Ritsuko brought up a hand to her forehead in disappointment.
"这意味着我们失去了原本应解决我们初号机能源问题的 S2 引擎。" 律子失望地抬起手扶额。

"We also no longer have thousands of people either," Misato firmly reminded her.
"我们这里同样不再有成千上万的人了," 碇真嗣坚定地提醒她。

"True," Ritsuko replied somewhat abashedly. "But that S2 Engine would have done wonders for us. Imagine being able to do away with power cables; no more five minute timers in full combat conditions when the cable is lost. Not to mention when this war is over, the S2 Engine could be repurposed for less militaristic uses and solve a lot of energy problems."
确实如此，" 律子略显窘迫地回应。"但 S2 引擎原本能给我们带来巨大变革。设想一下，不再受电源线牵制；在激烈战斗中，一旦电缆丢失，也不再受限于五分钟的倒计时。何况战后，S2 引擎还能转作民用，解决众多能源难题。

"Well for now, let's focus on the immediate future, such as the next few days. What's happening with Unit-03?"
目前，我们先集中精力关注近期的安排，比如未来几天的情况。Unit-03 目前进展如何？

Shigeru snorted. "America's fobbing it off onto us. Called us up practically before the dust settled, asking us to 'take it off their hands'."
志賀嗤之以鼻。"美国正把这烫手山芋扔给我们。尘埃几乎还没落定，他们就急忙打电话来，让我们'接手'。"

Makoto raised an eyebrow. "Weren't they the ones demanding to be allowed to build Units 03 and 04?"
真嗣挑了挑眉，反问道：“他们不正是要求允许建造 3 号机和 4 号机的那群人吗？”

"Yeah, but now they're scared of both of them." Shigeru shrugged and folded his arms.
"没错，可如今他们俩都感到害怕。" 志贺耸耸肩，双手抱臂。

"Is Unit-03 actually complete?" asked Misato. On the one hand, having another Evangelion would be a great asset for fending off the Angels, but on the other... that would potentially mean another teenager dragged into this war. Another childhood ruined by adults that couldn't do it themselves.
"三号机真的完成了吗？" 碇真嗣问道。一方面，多一台 EVA 对抗使徒无疑是一大助力，但另一方面...这可能意味着又有一个少年被卷入这场战争。又一个童年被那些无力承担责任的成年人摧毁。

"Complete enough," said Shigeru. "It's going to be airlifted to us at America's expense."
志賀说：'已经够完整了，将由美国承担费用空运过来。'

"Airlifted? That will cost a lot of money," said Maya, finally putting the tablet down as the screen shut down and the room lights came on.
"空运？那可得花不少钱，"玛雅说着，放下手中的平板，屏幕随之熄灭，房间的灯光亮了起来。

"Fortunately, we're not paying it," replied Misato as she headed for the door, but stopped halfway there. "Oh, who's going to be the pilot for Unit-03?"
幸好我们不用付钱，" 米萨托说着走向门口，半途却停下了脚步。"对了，谁来驾驶三号机呢？

"I haven't decided yet," said Ritsuko. "I need to get a close look at the Eva when it gets here before I can work out who'd be best suited for an activation test."
我尚未决定，" 里津子表示。"得等 Eva 运抵，我仔细查看后，才能决定谁最适合执行启动测试。

"Right." Misato nodded. "Should I let the kids know about it yet?"
对。" 葛城美里点头道。"我现在该告诉孩子们这件事吗？

Ritsuko quirked an eyebrow. "Do you want to get bugged by Aida and Soryu constantly? Because I can guarantee they'll both end up begging to be the one selected."
律子挑眉道："你想一直被艾达和索吕纠缠不休吗？我敢肯定，他们俩最后都会争着求被选上。"

Misato sheepishly raised a hand to scratch at her head. "Yeah, I suppose so."
碇真嗣有些尴尬地抬起手，挠了挠头。“嗯，应该是这样。”

"Anyway, don't you have something else to distract them with in the meantime?" Ritsuko asked, moving towards the door. Behind her, the three bridge officers had come together to compare notes on the preparations for Unit-03's arrival.
"不管怎样，你就没有别的事情来暂时转移他们的注意力吗？" 律子边说边走向门口。在她身后，三位舰桥军官正聚在一起，讨论着迎接三号机到来的准备工作。

The hand froze as Misato's face scrunched up in concentration. "Uh... no? Can't think of anything."
手突然停住，因为真嗣的脸因专注思考而紧皱。“呃……没有？什么也想不出来。”

Ritsuko looked up at the ceiling and shook her head in disbelief. "It's November twenty-eig- wait..." She glanced at her watch. "Twenty-ninth. You've got Soryu's birthday coming up this Friday, and your own birthday next Tuesday." She pushed Misato through the door and out into the hallway. "Got two parties to look forward to. I'll save you asking and say that I'll try to make it if work doesn't pile up on me too much. I was too busy working on my own birthday to bother doing anything, so let's hope I can help celebrate yours."
律子抬头望向天花板，难以置信地摇了摇头。“今天是十一月二十八——不对……”她瞥了一眼手表。“二十九号。这周五是绫波的生日，下周二是你自己的生日。”她推着美里走出房门，来到走廊。“有两场派对等着呢。我先告诉你，如果工作不太多，我会尽量来。我自己的生日因为忙于工作都没庆祝，希望这次能帮你庆祝。”

"...Shit," Misato swore as she began walking under her own power. "December sure came up on us quick, huh? October only felt like yesterday."
...Shit," Misato 咒骂着，开始自行走动。"十二月来得真快啊，感觉十月就像昨天一样。

"Well go home and try to get back to sleep," Ritsuko suggested. "In the morning, see if you can rope Shinji into helping you out with Soryu's birthday."
我们回家试着再睡会儿吧，" 律子提议，"明早看看能否让真嗣帮你一起筹备绫波的生日。

"Oh sure, that won't be awkward at all," Misato muttered. "It's been a couple of days since they got discharged from the hospital and they're still tiptoeing around each other."
哦，当然，那一点也不尴尬，" 葛城美里低声说道。"他们出院好几天了，彼此间还是显得有些拘谨。

"You'll work something out, I'm sure."
你肯定能想出办法的。

"Thanks for the vote of confidence."
感谢您的信任支持。

"You're welcome." 不客气。

Shinji felt like he was walking through a minefield. He found himself excessively cautious about what he said any time Asuka was nearby, and she seemed to be doing the same. However, unlike at the hospital, Asuka wasn't constantly evading him; they just couldn't think of anything to say to each other outside of simple things like 'what do you want for dinner?'.
真嗣感觉自己如同行走在雷区。每当明日香在附近，他便对言辞格外小心，而她似乎也如此。与医院时不同，明日香不再刻意回避他；只是两人除了“晚餐想吃什么？”这类简单话题外，再也找不到其他可谈之事。

It had only been a couple of days since their latest hospital visit, but Shinji was already more high-strung than he'd ever been while fighting the Angels. The ball was entirely within Asuka's court; all he could do was wait to see if she returned it or, as he was dreading more and more, threw the ball in the trash.
距离他们上一次去医院不过几天，真嗣却比对抗使徒时还要焦虑。一切取决于明日香；他只能等待，看她是否会回应，或者，他越来越担心的是，她会选择无视。

So it came as just a bit of a surprise to Shinji when Misato called him over to her apartment on Sunday morning and asked him to help plan a birthday party for Asuka.
因此，当周日早晨，美里打电话让真嗣去她家，并请他协助筹备明日香的生日聚会时，真嗣确实感到有些出乎意料。

"...You're joking, right?"
...你是在开玩笑吧？

Misato grinned at him from her relaxed position on her couch. "Not in the slightest! It's coming up this Friday and I'll be too busy at NERV to be able to do it all myself. Of course I'm not expecting you to do everything either; maybe those friends of yours can help out."
美里在沙发上悠闲地对他笑了笑：“完全不会！这周五就是截止日，我在 NERV 会忙得团团转，一个人实在应付不来。我也没打算让你一个人承担所有，或许你可以叫上你的朋友们一起来帮忙。”

Shinji exhaled slowly and brought up a hand to rub his head. "Well I'm sure Hikari would be happy to assist; she'd likely ask to handle the food side of things. Not quite sure about Toji or Kensuke though."
真嗣深吸一口气，缓缓吐出，抬手揉了揉额头。“我敢肯定，光会很高兴帮忙的，她多半会主动提出负责食物部分。但东治和健介就不好说了。”

"I'm sure you'll work things out," Misato said encouragingly. "Besides, you'll be needed as the distraction on Friday."
我相信你能处理好，" 美里鼓励道。"而且，周五你还得负责吸引注意力。

Shinji blinked. "Excuse me?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，问道："不好意思，您说什么？"

Misato held up a hand, extending fingers as she gave her points. "I can't get away from work until around dinner time, we can't set up the party while you're all busy at school, and we can't have the surprise ruined by the birthday girl getting home early. You'll need to keep Asuka occupied until it's ready."
美里举起手，伸出手指说明她的想法。“我得工作到晚饭时间，你们都在学校，我们没法布置派对，更不能让寿星提前回家破坏惊喜。你们得想办法让明日香在外面多待会儿，直到派对准备妥当。”

"W-why me?!" Shinji desperately asked. "You know what things are like between us now! If we can barely even say two words to each other, how am I supposed to keep her busy?"
为什么偏偏是我？！" 真嗣绝望地问道。"你清楚我们现在的关系，连话都说不上两句，我怎么可能让她忙得团团转？

"Calm down, Shinji." Misato stood up and walked over to him, laying a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "You've got a week before the party. Things have been tense between you two before, but you've managed to work things out."
冷静点，真嗣。" 三笠站起来，走到他面前，轻拍他的肩膀以示安慰。"派对前还有一周时间。你们之前也经历过紧张时期，但总能找到解决办法。

"Not like this!" Shinji exclaimed, before burying his face in his hands. "Stupidest thing I've ever done, telling her how I feel..."
不该是这样的！" 真嗣喊着，双手捂脸。"向她表白心迹，真是我干过的最蠢的事……

"The only stupidity I'm seeing is you thinking that being in love is a bad thing." The abrupt harshness in Misato's voice pulled his eyes up away from his hands. She was now glaring at him with her arms crossed. Though she wasn't in uniform, she was most definitely acting like Major Katsuragi right now. "I had a chat with Asuka after she ran off during the debriefing. I'm not going to break her trust by telling you everything, but I will say this."
我所见的唯一愚蠢，就是你竟认为恋爱是件坏事。" 米萨托声音中的突兀严厉让他不由得抬头，只见她双臂交叉，目光锐利地盯着他。尽管未着军装，此刻的她却俨然是加津美少校的姿态。"在明日香简报会上跑掉后，我与她有过交谈。我不会泄露所有细节来辜负她的信任，但有些话我得说。

Shinji flinched back slightly as Misato suddenly leaned forward. "The reason for her indecision has nothing to do with you personally. It is not your fault. Asuka's been through a lot in her life, and it's left her rather... hesitant on certain matters. Give her time."
真嗣因美里突然前倾而略显退缩。"她之所以犹豫，并非针对你个人。这不是你的错。明日香一生经历颇多，这让她在某些事情上显得颇为迟疑。给她一些时间吧。"

"Alright, alright," Shinji relented, before heaving a sigh. While he would of course always respect Asuka's privacy, he could not stop himself from being curious about what exactly had happened to her. It was something nasty, obviously, and he wondered how it compared to his own life for a brief moment before hurriedly shutting down that line of thought. It was not a competition. "So do you have any ideas how I can keep her occupied after school?"
行吧，行吧，" 真嗣妥协了，随后深深叹了口气。尽管他肯定会始终尊重明日香的隐私，可他还是忍不住对她到底遭遇了什么感到好奇。显然，那是不好的经历，他一瞬间将其与自己的生活做了比较，但很快便制止了这种想法。这不是比谁更惨。"那你有什么办法让我放学后让她有事可做吗？

Misato shrugged helplessly. "Sorry, only thing I can think of is getting Rits to bring you two in for whatever test she can think of, and I doubt either of you would like to deal with that before a party. You should try asking that Hikari girl for suggestions."
美里无奈地耸了耸肩。“抱歉，我唯一能想到的就是让律子带你们去做她能想到的任何测试，但我猜你们俩都不想在派对前面对这些。你们不妨问问那个叫光的女孩子有什么好建议。”

As Shinji should have expected, Hikari was immediately on board with the idea of helping to plan Asuka's party. In fact she essentially took the over role of planner from Misato, which was met with no resistance. Toji and Kensuke were roped in to do the hauling, as Asuka did not exactly hang out with them much and therefore didn't pay attention to what they were up to. The biggest surprise for Shinji was when Hikari pulled him aside on Thursday morning before the teacher arrived at their class to explain his part in the next day's festivities.
果不其然，真嗣发现光对帮忙策划明日香的派对一事立刻表示支持。她几乎从美里手中接管了策划工作，而美里对此并无异议。东治和健介被拉来负责搬运物资，因为明日香与他们交往不多，所以并未察觉他们的行动。真嗣最意外的是，周四一早，老师还未到教室，光就悄悄把他拉到一旁，向他详细说明了次日庆祝活动中他的任务。

"You want me to make the cake?" he said in abject disbelief, just barely managing to keep his voice down. "I've got no sense of taste; I've basically been banned from the kitchen!"
你想让我做蛋糕？" 他难以置信地低声说道，几乎控制不住自己的声音。"我根本尝不出味道，厨房都快不让我进了！

"You'll be fine," Hikari reassured him. "I'll be giving you a hand, and you'll be following the recipe I give you. You're not going to poison anyone."
放心吧，"光安慰道，"我会帮你，你只需按照我给的食谱操作。不会有人中毒的。

"Well..." Shinji scratched his head. "I suppose baking doesn't involve much tasting like cooking does."
嗯……" 真嗣挠着头说，"烘焙似乎不像烹饪那样频繁尝味。

Hikari nodded. "Baking is a very precise thing compared to cooking. It's practically a science."
光点点头说：“烘焙比烹饪更讲究精确，它几乎就是一门科学。”

"But why do you want me to make it? Can't you just do it yourself?"
为什么非要我来做？你自己做不行吗？

"Let me answer that question with one of my own. You've most likely been stressing out about this party. Do you even have a present for Asuka yet?"
我来用一个问题回应你。想必你一直在为这场聚会烦恼吧。你给飞鸟准备礼物了吗？

"Uh..." Shinji's face began to heat up. He had been getting nervous about the swiftly approaching day, and he couldn't even think of anything Asuka would like.
"呃..." 真嗣感到脸颊发烫。随着那一天的临近，他越来越紧张，连阿苏卡可能喜欢的东西都想不出来。

Hikari was clearly a mind reader, judging by the way she was now grinning at him. "Just as I thought. So Asuka's present is going to be a cake, lovingly prepared by her co-pilot and best friend." She almost sounded jealous when mentioning that second moniker. "So here's the plan: wait for Suzuhara after school. You, him and Aida will be leaving school together, apparently heading to the arcade, but I'll be collecting you part way and taking you to my place where we'll prepare the cake. It'll be staying at my place until after school tomorrow, where I'll then take it to your apartment while you're keeping Asuka distracted."
显然，光拥有读心能力，从她此刻对他露出的笑容便可见一斑。“果然不出我所料。明日香的礼物将是一个蛋糕，由她的副驾驶兼挚友亲手制作。”提及后者身份时，她语气中似乎带着几分羡慕。“计划如下：放学后等铃原。你、他和洞木一同离校，看似前往游戏中心，但我会中途接你们，带至我家准备蛋糕。蛋糕将留在我处，直至次日放学，届时我会将其送往你的公寓，而你则负责牵制明日香。”

Shinji glanced over at the redhead in question, who was staring off into space while tapping a finger against her desk. He quickly sensed danger and looked away, but now he could feel a pair of blue eyes staring into the back of his head.
真嗣瞥向那位红发女孩，只见她凝视着虚空，手指在桌上轻敲。他立刻感到不妙，赶紧移开目光，然而此刻，他能感觉到一双蓝眼睛正紧盯着他的后脑。

"I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to do that," he sheepishly admitted, directing a hopeful glance at the class representative.
"我还是没弄明白该怎么操作，"他有些不好意思地承认，同时满怀期待地看向了班长。

But Hikari simply shook her head. "I can't do everything for you, Shinji. You need to decide for yourself." She headed past him towards her desk. "You'd better be quick though, you've only got one more day to think of something."
然而，光只是摇了摇头。“真嗣，我不能替你做所有决定。你得自己拿主意。”她从他身旁走过，向自己的办公桌走去。“但你得抓紧时间，只剩一天考虑了。”

Shinji immediately regretted forgetting about possibly the most important question of the party planning.
真嗣立刻后悔忽略了派对筹备中可能最关键的问题。

After school, Hikari's plan went off without a hitch. Asuka didn't even bat an eye at the fact that he was going off to the arcade with Toji and Kensuke. The appearance of Hikari at the meeting point came as something of a shock though, seeing as the last time Shinji had seen her she was still up in Class 2-A. He had the feeling that if he asked, no answer would be forthcoming on how she had beaten the boys to the rendezvous. Instead he waved goodbye to his male friends and followed Hikari, who made a brief stop at a supermarket to get the last couple things they needed for the cake before heading to her house. At the front door, they bumped into Hikari's older sister Kodama.
放学后，光的计划顺利进行，明日香对真嗣与东治、健介去游戏厅的打算视若无睹。光突然出现在集合点，让真嗣颇感意外，毕竟上次见面她还在 2-A 班。他预感即使询问，也得不到她如何抢先男生们到达的答案。于是，他向朋友们挥手告别，跟随光，她在超市稍作停留，补齐了做蛋糕的最后几样材料，随后一同前往她家。在门前，他们偶遇了光的姐姐，小玉。

"Hey sis," Kodama greeted. "Just going out for a bit, I'll be back in time for dinner. Dad's gonna be about half an hour late apparently."
嘿，姐姐，"小圆打招呼说，"我出去一会儿，晚饭前会回来的。爸似乎要晚到半小时。

Hikari nodded. "Okay. Nozomi's at a friend's house too. Oh, this is another of my classmates, Shinji Ikari." He gave a shy wave. "His housemate is having a birthday tomorrow and I'm helping him bake the cake."
光点头说：“好的。希美也在朋友家。对了，这位是我的同班同学，碇真嗣。”他有些害羞地挥了挥手。“他的室友明天生日，我正帮他一起做蛋糕。”

"Ikari, huh? Nice to meet you," Kodama replied with an appraising look, which quickly turned to puzzlement as she returned her attention to her sister. "Hang on, what about that Suzuhara boy you keep talking about? Given up on him already?"
愤怒，是吗？很高兴认识你，"小玉回答时带着打量的目光，但随即转为疑惑，她再次看向自己的妹妹。"等等，你常提起的那个铃原家的男孩呢？已经放弃他了吗？

"N-no!" Hikari stammered, face bright red. "I-it's not like that!"
不，不是的！"光结巴着说，脸红得发烫。"根本不是你想的那样！

Kodama gave an expansive shrug. "Hey, it's none of my business. Anyway, I'll see you tonight. Later."
木灵大方地耸了耸肩。“嘿，这事儿跟我没关系。那今晚见，回见。”

Off she went before Hikari could attempt to correct her, leaving the class representative to sigh and wave Shinji into the house. "Why did she have to bring that up?" she moaned, apparently talking to herself.
光还没来得及纠正，她就匆匆离去，留下班长叹息着招呼真嗣进屋。“她干嘛非要提那茬呢？”她喃喃自语，仿佛在跟自己说话。

"What's the matter?" asked Shinji. "You and Toji have been friends for a long time, haven't you? Have you tried seeing if he's interested in taking things further?"
怎么了？" 新二问道。"你和东治不是多年的好友吗？你试过探探他是否愿意让关系更进一步吗？

The blush returned, but Hikari turned her head and fixed a suddenly steely gaze on Shinji. "I could say the same for you and Asuka. Haven't you two been friends for a long time? Have you tried-"
脸颊再次泛红，但光转过头，目光突然变得坚定，直视着真嗣。“我对你和明日香也可以这么说。你们不是多年的朋友吗？你有没有尝试过-”

"Please!" Shinji held up a hand to try and halt the conversational train wreck in the making. "I... don't want to talk about that right now..."
请等一下！" 真嗣举手试图制止即将失控的对话。"我...现在真的不想谈这个...

"...Oh." Thrown off by his response, Hikari stared blankly at him for a moment. "Well... um... let's get to work on this cake then."
...哦。" 光被他的回答弄得一时语塞，愣愣地看了他一会儿。"那...呃...我们开始做蛋糕吧。

XXX

The kitchen was immaculate, looking like it had been lifted out of a magazine or cooking show. Hikari brought out all the needed ingredients and placed them on the counter top in the middle of the kitchen then disappeared momentarily, returning with a recipe book she opened up in front of Shinji.
厨房干净得无可挑剔，宛如从杂志或烹饪节目里直接搬来的一般。Hikari 取出所有必需的食材，整齐地摆放在厨房中央的台面上，随后短暂离开，回来时带着一本食谱，在 Shinji 面前翻开。

"'Black Forest cake'," Shinji read, before looking at the associated picture with widening eyes. "Whoa, that looks complicated."
慎二看着'黑森林蛋糕'的描述，目光转向附图，眼睛不由得睁大。'哇，这看起来真复杂。'

"It's not too bad," said Hikari. "I wouldn't have picked this one if I didn't think you could do it."
其实还可以，"光说道，"我选这个是因为我相信你能胜任。

Indeed, it seemed rather easy once they got started. First came the two cake layers, which were quickly prepared under Hikari's watchful eye and put into the oven for half an hour. In the meantime, she set Shinji to work on whipping the cream and preparing the cherry syrup. Once that was done there was still some time left on the oven, so Hikari asked to have a look at Shinji's school work. She was generally pleased with what she saw, although there were a couple things she advised him on going forward.
确实，一旦他们开始动手，事情似乎变得相当简单。首先，两层蛋糕在光子的细心监督下迅速准备好，放入烤箱烤了半小时。在此期间，她让真嗣负责打发奶油和制作樱桃糖浆。完成这些后，烤箱还有剩余时间，光子便请求查看真嗣的学校作业。她总体上对所见感到满意，但仍有几处建议他今后改进。

The oven dinged, and the cake layers were removed, but they needed time to cool so it was back to the books for another ten minutes.
烤箱发出叮声，蛋糕层随即取出，但还需冷却片刻，于是又埋头书本，静待十分钟。

"Shinji," Hikari hesitantly said on their return to the kitchen. "Do you... think things would work between Toji and I?"
Shinji，" Hikari 有些迟疑地开口，当他们回到厨房时。"你觉得...我和 Toji 之间能相处得好吗？

"Well..." Shinji scratched his head. "Toji always seems to be talking about you. I get the feeling he's not really as annoyed with you harassing him at school as he seems. How long exactly have you two known each other?"
嗯……" 真嗣挠着头说，"东治老是在谈论你。我觉得他对你在学校逗他的事，其实并不像看起来那么介意。你们俩认识多久了？

"We started school together." Hikari looked off into space and smiled. "Our class was asked to introduce ourselves on the first day, and I was super nervous. But then this kid who had gone before me just turned to me and gave me a thumbs up. Afterwards we just seemed to be stuck with each other. One time another boy yanked on my hair, and before I could even react Toji was there looking like he was about to send the boy home in a box."
我们一同开始了校园生活。"光望向远方，脸上挂着微笑。"开学第一天，老师让我们自我介绍，我紧张得不行。但就在我前面发言的那个孩子，他转过身来对我竖起了大拇指。从那以后，我们俩似乎就形影不离了。记得有一次，有个男孩拽了我的头发，我还没反应过来，东二就已经挡在我面前，一副要把那男孩打包送回家的架势。

Shinji grinned as he pictured the scene. "Did he actually hit the boy?"
真嗣咧嘴笑着，想象着那一幕。“他真的打了那个男孩吗？”

"No, thankfully. It wasn't like he was trying to rip my hair out, more like he was trying to get my attention, but Toji acted like the boy had punched me in the face." Hikari glanced at Shinji and mirrored his grin. "Oh, and take one guess who that other boy was."
不，还好。他并非真要扯我头发，更像是在设法吸引我的注意，但东治却表现得仿佛那男孩给了我一耳光。" 光瞥了真嗣一眼，也学着他露出了笑容，"哦，猜猜另一个男孩是谁。

It didn't take an Asuka-level intellect to figure it out. "Kensuke."
其实不难理解，就是"健介"。

"Yep." 对。

Back to the cake they went. The syrup was used to brush the two layers of the cake, then cream and cherries were added in the middle as they were placed together. More cream was added to the top, then flaked chocolate all over, then more cream from a piping bag made a sort of frame around the top that the last of the cherries were sat on.
他们重新回到蛋糕制作中。首先，用糖浆涂抹蛋糕的两层，接着在中间夹入奶油和樱桃，将两层蛋糕合并。随后，在顶部覆盖一层奶油，撒满碎巧克力，再用裱花袋挤出的奶油在顶部勾勒一圈，最后点缀上剩余的樱桃。

Shinji wiped his brow as he leaned back and beheld his creation. There were several imperfections that stood out to him like an Angel in a police lineup, such as how the chocolate flakes weren't evenly spread and some of the cherries sat rather lopsided.
真嗣擦了擦额头，身体向后一靠，凝视着自己的作品。他注意到几个明显的瑕疵，就像警察列队中突兀的天使，比如巧克力片没有均匀散布，还有些樱桃摆放得歪歪斜斜。

"It's fine, Shinji," Hikari reassured him when he pointed these flaws out. "Asuka is not going to care about that, and the cake's going to get eaten anyway. Focus on the fact that you made this."
没事的，真嗣，" 光在他指出这些小瑕疵时安慰道，"明日香不会介意的，毕竟蛋糕最后都会被吃掉。关键是这是你亲手做的。

"...Yeah, I really did, huh?" Shinji was frankly astonished. After he'd revealed his lack of taste to Asuka and subsequently been... discouraged from preparing food, he hadn't exactly had the chance to do anything even a tenth as complicated as this. But now it sat before him; despite all its flaws, he didmake this. He made it for Asuka.
"...确实，我竟然做到了。" 真嗣坦诚地感到惊讶。自从他向明日香坦白自己对烹饪一窍不通，并因此被劝阻不要再下厨后，他便再未尝试过如此复杂的料理。然而此刻，尽管成品不尽完美，这确确实实出自他手。他是为明日香而做的。

"I'll be sure to pay you back for this once I work out how," he said to Hikari.
"我一定会想办法还你这个人情的，"他向光承诺道。

"Don't worry about that, Shinji," she replied. "I didn't do this expecting compensation, I did it as a favour for two of my friends. Now we just need to get it into the fridge where it will remain untouched until tomorrow. I've already told my family that this cake is off-limits, and that dire consequences will arise if there's even so much as a fingerprint in the cream."
别担心，真嗣，"她回答说，"我做这个并不是为了得到什么，只是帮两位朋友一个忙。现在我们得把它放进冰箱，确保它到明天都保持原样。我已经跟家里人说了，这个蛋糕谁也不许碰，要是奶油上留下一点痕迹，后果自负。

Judging by the determination etched into Hikari's face, Shinji felt reassured that his cake -his cake that he made himself- would remain unmolested.
看到光脸上坚定的表情，新二放心了，他亲手制作的蛋糕将安然无恙。

Friday morning came... and Shinji still hadn't come up with a method of distracting Asuka after school. It didn't help that he occasionally saw Asuka giving him some strange looks, as if she were expecting something of him, but he simply couldn't work out what she wanted and he wasn't about to ask.
星期五的早晨到来了...然而真嗣依旧没能想出放学后如何转移明日香的注意力。他偶尔瞥见明日香投来异样的目光，似乎在期待他有所行动，但他实在揣摩不透她的心思，也不打算开口询问。

At school, Hikari pulled him aside before roll call again.
在学校里，光又在点名前把他拉到一旁。

"Do you have something planned yet?" she asked, giving him a look rather similar to Asuka's earlier in the day.
"你有什么打算了吗？"她问道，眼神与今天早些时候明日香的眼神颇为相似。

"I've got... a sort of idea at the moment," he blatantly lied, praying that nothing would give him away even as his face began to subtly heat up. "Still working on the fine details, but I'm sure it'll keep her away until you guys are ready."
我现在有个大致的想法，"他撒谎道，内心祈祷不要露出马脚，尽管脸上已开始微微泛红。"细节还在斟酌中，但我相信这足以让她暂时远离，直到你们准备妥当。

Hikari narrowed her eyes at him, silent for long enough that Shinji wondered if she was merely waiting for him to dig himself deeper. In the end, unable to stand it any longer, Shinji said, "When you're ready for us to head home, ring me and hang up right away twice in a row. I'll have my phone on vibrate so Asuka doesn't hear it."
光眯起眼睛看着他，长时间的沉默让真嗣觉得她或许在等他自己越描越黑。最后，真嗣实在按捺不住，开口道：“你准备回家时，给我打个电话，马上挂掉，连续两次。我会把手机调成振动模式，这样明日香就不会察觉。”

That seemed to satisfy Hikari, as she turned away without another word, leaving Shinji to head to his desk. Along the way Asuka gave him that look again. The old teacher soon arrived and cast his dastardly spell over the class, leading to half of them bringing out their laptops and the others falling into a death-like trance.
光似乎对此感到满意，她一言不发地转身离去，留下真嗣走向自己的座位。途中，明日香再次向他投去了那种眼神。不久，老教师走进教室，施展了他的魔法，使得一半学生拿出笔记本电脑，而其他人则陷入了沉睡般的恍惚状态。

Throughout the day, Asuka just kept looking at him strangely. She never said a word directly to him, even during lunch when the pilots and their friends ate on the roof. Nobody else seemed to notice, which made Shinji wonder if the stress of the Angel War was finally starting to get to him. But soon, thankfully, the end of the school day came.
整天下来，明日香一直用异样的眼光盯着他。即便在午餐时间，飞行员们和朋友们在屋顶聚餐时，她也未曾直接与他交谈。旁人似乎都未察觉，这让真嗣不禁思索，是否是与天使战斗的压力终于开始侵蚀他的心智。幸好，不久后学校的一天便结束了。

...And he still hadn't thought of anything.
...而他依旧一筹莫展。

As he stepped out of the main building, eyes downcast as he tried to come to terms with the fact that he'd essentially ruined the birthday party plan...
他走出主楼，目光低垂，心中挣扎着接受自己已毁掉生日派对计划的事实...

"Hey! Shinji!" 嗨！真嗣！

...a shout right behind his left ear just about made him jump out of his skin. He turned around and reflexively flinched upon seeing Asuka's face precisely three millimetres away from his own.
...就在他左耳后突然传来一声大喊，差点让他吓得魂不附体。他转过身，一看到明日香的脸近在咫尺，便本能地往后一缩。

"Um... y-yes, Asuka?" He was just barely able to stammer out the question as he began to slowly retreat to a safe distance.
"呃...是、是的，明日香？" 他费力地问出这句话，同时开始慢慢后退，以保持安全距离。

"What's the plan?" she asked, thankfully pulling back to a point where Shinji only somewhat thought she was going to bite his face off.
"计划是什么？"她问道，庆幸地退后一步，让真嗣觉得她只是差点要咬他的脸。

"...Plan?" Shinji repeated in honest puzzlement. "What plan?"
……计划？" 真嗣不解地重复道。"什么计划啊？

Asuka stared at him for a moment, then her entire body slumped like a puppet with its strings cut as she let out a loud sigh. "I should have known," she muttered in German. Continuing in her native tongue, she said, "The plan where you keep me distracted and away from our place until everyone else is ready."
明日香凝视了他片刻，随后全身仿佛断了线的傀儡般颓然垂下，她长叹一声。“我本该料到的，”她用德语低语。接着用母语继续道：“就是那个计划，你让我分神，把我从我们的地方支开，直到其他人准备就绪。”

"Oh, that," said Shinji, before her words caught up to him and his voice raised in surprise. "Wait, what?! How did you know about that?"
哦，你说那个啊，" 真嗣刚说完，她的话才让他恍然大悟，声音中透露出惊讶，"等等，什么？！你怎么会知道那件事？

"Because I'm not an idiot," was Asuka's response as she raised her hands and let them flop to her sides. "I know what day it is today, and I figured my friends would be planning something." She paused, thinking for a moment. "They are plan-... yes of course they are, your response just now proves it."
我又不傻，" 飞鸟说着，举起双手又随意放下。"我知道今天是什么日子，猜到朋友们可能会有所安排。" 她顿了顿，思索着。"他们确实在策划... 没错，他们肯定有计划，你刚才的话已经说明了一切。

Shinji sighed. So much for giving her a nice surprise. "Yeah; and like you said, my job was to keep you busy, but I couldn't think of how to do that."
真嗣叹了口气，心想给她的惊喜算是落空了。“嗯，就像你说的，我的任务是让你忙个不停，可我就是想不出办法。”

"You're hopeless sometimes, Third," Asuka said in what Shinji thought was almost a fond tone. "It's a good thing I'm smart enough to see this party coming. Now I can help you out by doing your job for you."
你有时真是让人没辙，三号，" 明日香说道，语气中似乎带着几分宠溺。"还好我够机灵，能预料到这场派对。现在我可以帮你一把，代你完成工作。

"Uh, what do you mean?"
嗯，你指的是什么？

"Simple. I'll decide where we're going to go and play along with your 'deception'." Asuka looked away and folded her arms. "I'm sure they're working their asses off getting things ready. Wouldn't want to disappoint them by not being surprised."
很简单。我会决定我们的去向，并配合你的'小把戏'。" 明日香别过脸，双臂抱胸。"他们肯定正忙得团团转，准备惊喜。我可不想因为没有感到意外而让他们失望。

"But where are we going to go in the meantime?" Shinji pressed.
"可是在这期间，我们该去哪儿呢？" 真嗣追问道。

"You've got two options." Asuka pointed back at the school. "We could go to the library where I can make sure you're keeping up with your work, or we can go to that one ice-cream place we all went to the day Wondergirl killed a giant spider."
你有两个选项。" 明日香指向学校，提议道："我们可以去图书馆，我帮你检查功课进度，或者去那家冰淇淋店，就是奇迹女孩击败巨型蜘蛛那天我们一起去的那家。

Shinji blinked in stunned silence, then let out a long, frustrated groan and sank to his knees. "It was that damn simple?!" he practically shouted at the sky. "Why the hell couldn't I think of that?!"
真嗣惊愕地眨眼，沉默片刻后，发出一声长长的、充满挫败感的呻吟，跪倒在地。“就这么简单？！”他几乎是对着天空怒吼，“我怎么就没想到这点？！”

Asuka burst out laughing. "Well now I think the choice is obvious: you need some ice-cream."
明日香忍不住笑出声来。"现在看来，答案很明显了：你得吃点冰淇淋。"

### Chapter 33 Happy Birthday!

Shinji stared moodily into his empty ice-cream bowl, his chin resting on folded arms on the table. The sugary treat had done a halfway decent job of improving his mood, even if he couldn't taste it, but there was still one underlying issue to contend with. An issue that was sitting directly across from him, polishing off her own ice-cream with every sign of enjoyment.
真嗣闷闷不乐地凝视着空空如也的冰淇淋碗，下巴搁在交叠的双臂上，放在桌上。尽管尝不出味道，这份甜食还是勉强让他的心情有所好转，但仍有一个根本问题亟待解决。这个问题就坐在他对面，正津津有味地享用着自己的冰淇淋。

Soon, Asuka's spoon clattered into her bowl and she sighed with contentment. She then looked at Shinji, following his gaze to his own bowl. "Sorry Shinji, but it'll take more effort than that to develop psychic powers. If you want more you'll just have to get up and buy it."
很快，明日香的勺子咔哒一声落入碗中，她满足地叹了口气。接着，她看向真嗣，顺着他的视线看向他的碗。“真嗣，抱歉，但要想拥有心灵感应，光这样可不行。你要是还想吃，就得自己起身去买。”

His head bobbing slightly as he grunted, Shinji continued to stare at the bowl.
真嗣一边低声咕哝，一边微微点头，目光始终不离那只碗。

Asuka sighed again, this time for a different reason. After a quick glance around at the half-full parlour, she switched to German. "Don't think I've ever seen you this unhappy."
明日香再次叹息，这次缘由不同。她迅速扫视了一圈半满的休息室，转而用德语说道：“真没见过你这么不高兴的样子。”

That got more of a response. Shinji looked up at her for a second, then his eyes nervously darted to the side. Finally, he sat up straight and exhaled, wishing all his problems could be carried away on that breath. "Sorry Asuka," he said, also in German. "I'm just... waiting for you to decide how you're going to try and let me down easy."
这番话引来了更多的反应。真嗣抬头望了她一眼，随即紧张地移开视线。最终，他挺直腰杆，深深叹了口气，希望所有烦恼能随这口气一同飘散。“抱歉，明日香，”他用德语说道，“我只是……在等你决定如何委婉地拒绝我。”

"Let you... down? What?" 让你失望？这是什么意思？

Shinji shook his head. Now might not be the best day to do this, but he was tired of the uncertainty. "I confessed to you when I thought we were going to die, because I didn't want to have any regrets like you. But all I managed to do was make things weird between us." He waved a hand at her. "As soon as you found out, you ran away. Misato had to bring you back so you could make something up to try and smooth things over. Earlier this week she tried to tell me that it wasn't my fault, but-" He cut himself off, putting a hand over his mouth and looking away again.
真嗣摇了摇头。今天或许不是表白的最佳时机，但他已厌倦了这种不确定感。“我以为我们命不久矣，便向你坦白了心迹，因为我不想像你那样抱憾终生。结果却只是让我们的关系变得尴尬。”他向她摆了摆手。“你一得知便逃之夭夭。美里不得不把你找回来，让你设法缓和局面。这周初，她还试图告诉我，这不是我的错，但是——”他突然打住，用手捂住嘴，再次别过头去。

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji could see Asuka's stunned expression. Why was she surprised at him knowing the truth?
真嗣从眼角余光中瞥见明日香一脸震惊。她为何对他知晓真相感到惊讶呢？

"Shinji," she began in a dangerous, low tone. "Do you really think so little of me? Do you really think I would string you along instead of giving you a straight answer if I was just going to turn you down?"
真嗣，" 她语气危险而低沉地开口，"你真觉得我这么不值得信任吗？如果我最终只是要拒绝你，你认为我会故意拖延，不给你一个明确的答复吗？

"What else could it be?" Shinji countered. All the stress of the previous week was starting to pour out of him. "Look, back in the briefing room you said we were still friends. Don't I deserve some up-front honesty?"
还能有什么别的可能？" 真嗣反驳道，过去一周的压力正从他身上倾泻而出。"听着，在简报室你说过我们依旧是朋友。难道我不该得到一些坦率的真诚吗？

"Honesty?" Asuka brought her hands down onto the table and leaned forward. "You want some honesty? Here's some goddamn honesty, Third Child! The truth is that I'm-" she cut herself off, looking away for a moment and wrapping her arms around herself.
"诚实？" 明日香双手重重地拍在桌上，身体前倾。"你要诚实？那就给你点真话，第三适格者！事实是，我——" 她突然停住，转头望向别处，双臂紧抱自己。

"I'm... scared." 我感到...害怕。

Shinji could no more stop the disbelieving snort that erupted from him than he could stop Sahaquiel with his bare hands. This earned him the sort of look from Asuka that clearly said, 'pick your next words with great care, or face my unbridled wrath'. He took a steadying breath.
真嗣无法抑制自己发出的怀疑嗤笑，正如他无法徒手阻止萨拉菲尔一般。这让他从明日香那里得到了一个警告的眼神，显然在说：“你的下一句话要慎重，否则将面对我无情的怒火。”他深吸一口气，稳住心神。

"Scared? Asuka, I've known you for most of my life," he carefully began, staring straight into the oncoming storm. "Even when we had the impossible task of practically catching a falling moon, you weren't afraid. Even when that giant spider was staring us down when we were on foot, you weren't afraid. What could possibly scare you?!"
害怕吗？明日香，我认识你大半辈子了，"他小心翼翼地说着，直视着迎面而来的风暴。"即使面对几乎要接住坠落月亮的艰巨任务，你也不曾畏惧。即使那只巨大的蜘蛛在我们徒步时虎视眈眈，你也不曾退缩。究竟还有什么能让你害怕呢？！

"That's not-" Asuka cut herself off, her voice a bit too strident for the public setting. As it was, a few people glanced in their direction. She ran a hand down her face before continuing in a slightly calmer, but still frustrated tone. "That's not quite the same thing, Shinji. Besides, you might not have noticed but my knees were definitely shaking when we met the spider Angel."
那并不一样——"明日香突然停下，意识到自己的声音在公共场合过于尖锐。确实，有几个人向他们投来目光。她用手抚过脸庞，调整情绪后，虽然依旧带着一丝烦躁，但语气已趋平静：“真嗣，那情况并不相同。而且，你或许没留意到，但当我面对那蜘蛛使徒时，我的膝盖确实在发抖。

"How is it not the same?" asked Shinji. "You're definitely a lot braver than me anyway."
怎么会不一样呢？" 真嗣问道。"无论如何，你都比我勇敢多了。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Says the boy who hopped into a giant robot to fight a monster without training just so a crippled girl wouldn't get sent out. And you didn't run away from the spider either."
明日香挑眉道：“这话出自那个男孩之口，他未经训练就跳进巨型机器人与怪兽搏斗，只为了不让一个残疾女孩上战场。面对蜘蛛时，你也没有退缩。”

"That's-..." Shinji huffed, and got a triumphant smirk from Asuka in response.
"那就是-..." 真嗣喘着粗气，明日香则得意地咧嘴一笑。

"Yeah. Bravery isn't a lack of fear, it's acting in spite of it. Whether you think it or not, you are brave."
没错。勇敢并非无所畏惧，而是在恐惧面前依然选择行动。不管你有没有意识到，你都展现出了勇敢。

The compliment brought some heat to Shinji's cheeks. "So what's got you scared about... us?" he asked, pointing between the two of them.
这句赞美让真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕。“你到底在害怕我们之间的什么？”他问道，手指在两人之间来回指了指。

"Well, it's..." Asuka broke off again, avoiding eye contact with him. "It's really not something I even like thinking about. My mother's... death..."
唉，这事……" 明日香再次语塞，目光躲闪。"我实在不愿多想。关于我母亲的去世……

Shinji's breath caught in his throat as that subject came up once again. "I-I'm sorry," he managed to croak out. "I didn't mean to make you think about that. Forget I said anything!"
话题再次被提起，真嗣的呼吸不由得一滞。“我……真的很抱歉，”他艰难地开口，“我不是有意让你想起那些不愉快。请忘了我的话吧！”

"No, Shinji." Asuka shook her head and hardened her gaze. "I need to tell you something so you can understand."
不，真嗣。" 明日香摇头，目光变得坚定。"我得告诉你一些事，这样你才能明白。

Shinji nervously rubbed the back of his head. He'd made a promise to her, and regardless of the situation he was not about to break it. "Um... well... I did say I'd listen when you're ready."
真嗣紧张地挠了挠后脑勺。他曾对她许下承诺，无论面临何种情况，他都不打算食言。"嗯...那个...我确实说过，等你准备好了我会倾听。"

"It's not... quite that just yet," replied Asuka. "More like... a small step towards that."
还没完全到那一步，" 飞鸟回应说，"更确切地说，是向那个目标迈进的一小步。

Shinji nodded but remained silent, letting her gather her thoughts.
真嗣点头不语，任由她梳理思绪。

Asuka closed her eyes and brought up her hands to partially cover her mouth, looking vaguely like she was imitating that pose his father always adopted at his desk. "So, because of... things that happened around the time Mama died, I... decided I couldn't let myself be vulnerable again."
明日香闭上双眼，双手轻掩口边，仿佛在模仿父亲常在书桌前的姿态。"因此，由于妈妈去世前后的一些事，我……下定决心不能再让自己暴露脆弱。"

Shinji tilted his head. "Vulnerable?"
真嗣侧头问道：“你是说脆弱吗？”

Asuka opened one eye to stare at him. "Two people that I thought... loved me. Two people that betrayed me when I needed them the most. They-" Once more, she stopped in the middle of her sentence.
明日香睁开一只眼，凝视着他。“我曾以为深爱我的两个人...却在最需要他们时背叛了我。他们——”她又一次在话说到一半时停住了。

"Asuka, don't try and force it out," said Shinji, his stomach roiling as he took in what had already been said. "I think you've already said more than enough for now, and I'm sorry -really sorry- for bringing this up."
Asuka，别勉强自己，" 新一说道，他的胃因已听到的内容而翻腾。"我觉得你已经说得够多了，现在，我真的很抱歉——非常抱歉——提起这件事。

It didn't matter that he had no idea who those two people were. Shinji felt such anger deep within him that they would turn their back on Asuka in her hour of need. This sounded like it was before he had written that first letter to her, but she had never mentioned a hint of it in her own correspondence. Then again, neither of them were ever willing to even tiptoe around the subject of their parents.
他并不认识那两个人，但这无关紧要。真嗣内心深处对他们在明日香最需要帮助时转身离去感到极度愤怒。这似乎发生在他给她写第一封信之前，然而她在回信中对此只字未提。毕竟，他们俩都避免触及关于父母的任何话题。

Asuka's open eye continued to stare, blinking several times.
明日香睁大的眼睛依旧凝视前方，眨了好几下。

"But at least now," Shinji pressed on. "I feel like I know what's happening. Because of what happened to you, you're wary about getting closely involved with anyone ever again, right?"
但至少现在，" 真嗣坚持说，"我似乎明白了情况。由于你的经历，你对再次与他人深交心存戒备，是这样吗？

She gave him a slow, hesitant nod.
她迟疑地缓缓点了点头。

"But we are still friends, right? Nothing's changed there?"
我们还是朋友，对吧？关系没变吧？

Another nod, much more emphatic this time.
再次点头，这次更加强调。

"And... you are thinking about..." It was Shinji's turn to trail off, too embarrassed to say the words.
"而且...你在想..." 真嗣也支吾起来，尴尬得说不出话来。

"Yes, but..." Asuka paused, then snarled in frustration. "I hate being afraid like this, but I can't help it. You are my best friend, Shinji, but whenever I think about... taking things further, that fear wraps its claws around my heart. Reminding me what happened last time. Telling me what could happen this time, considering our line of work. We've known each other for practically a decade. I trust you implicitly when we're fighting Angels, but when it comes to romance..."
是的，但是..." 明日香顿了顿，随后带着怒气低吼。"我真讨厌这种害怕的感觉，可就是控制不了。你是我最好的朋友，真嗣，但每当我想着... 让我们的关系更进一步时，那恐惧就像利爪一样攫住我的心。它提醒我上次的经历，警告我这次可能发生的事，毕竟我们的工作充满危险。我们相识近十年，战斗中我对你绝对信任，但一谈到爱情...

"I understand, Asuka," said Shinji as he tried to swallow down his disappointment past the lump in his throat. "If you're not ready, then I'm not going to do the dumb thing and try to rush you to a decision. Right, now, I'm just happy you've told me what's going on."
我理解，明日香，" 真嗣努力咽下喉中的失望，说道，"如果你尚未准备好，我不会鲁莽行事，催促你做决定。此刻，你能告诉我实情，我已经很欣慰了。

As if the universe was waiting for its cue, Shinji's phone vibrated in his pocket. He instinctively reached for it then stopped with his hand hovering awkwardly in the air as the call stopped then started again. Just like he'd told Hikari.
仿佛宇宙正等待着某个信号，真嗣口袋里的手机突然震动起来。他本能地伸手去取，却在半空中停顿，手尴尬地悬着，因为电话刚一停下又再次响起。正如他对光所说的那样。

"They're ready for us," he announced. "The party, I mean."
他宣布说：‘他们已经为我们的到来做好准备了，我指的是聚会。’

Asuka's hands dropped to the table as she flashed a look of puzzlement at him. "How do you know?" As soon as Shinji told her about the signal, understanding dawned on her face. "Aaah. Pretty sneaky, Shinji. Just in time, too. I was about to get more ice cream, but we'd better save room."
明日香双手搁在桌上，疑惑地看向他。“你怎么知道的？”真嗣一解释信号的事，她顿时明白了。“哦，真嗣，你真机灵。来得正好，我刚想再去拿点冰淇淋，不过我们还是留点胃口吧。”

Shinji nodded and got to his feet, taking their plastic bowls and spoons to the bin and waving goodbye to the woman behind the counter before joining Asuka outside the shop. Their journey back to the apartment building was done with just a bit more haste than necessary, as neither of them wanted to keep their friends waiting too long.
碇真嗣点头起身，收拾好塑料碗勺扔进垃圾桶，向柜台后的女士挥手道别后，便与明日香一同离开商店。两人加快脚步返回公寓，都不愿让朋友们久等。

Right at the door to their apartment, Asuka put out a hand to stop Shinji as he made to unlock the door. "I need a second," she said, then grinned. "Gotta make sure I'm appropriately surprised, after all!" She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, her hands moving up her body and out to her sides as if she were adopting a meditative pose. "Right. Let's go in and have a perfectly normal evening, Shinji!"
就在他们公寓门口，明日香伸手拦住了正要开门的真嗣。“等一下，”她笑着说，“我得装作很惊喜才行！”她闭上眼，深吸一口气，双手缓缓举至身体两侧，仿佛在冥想。“好了，我们进去享受一个平常的夜晚吧，真嗣！”

The grin was infectious; Shinji couldn't stop himself from mirroring it. He slapped a hand over his face and dragged it down to try and physically force the smile away as he unlocked their front door. Stepping into the entrance hallway, he 'accidentally' bumped his shoes against the wall while taking them off just to make sure the other people in the apartment knew they were coming.
那笑容极具感染力，真嗣情不自禁地跟着笑了起来。他用手捂住脸，用力往下拉，试图用物理方式驱散笑容，同时打开了家门。走进玄关时，他故意用鞋子轻碰墙壁，好让屋里的人知道他们回来了。

Asuka brushed past him after removing her own shoes, but turned to face him just before she would have seen into the kitchen and began to walk backwards. "Sure was nice of you to invite me out for ice-cream, eh Shinji?"
明日香脱掉鞋子后，从他身旁掠过，却在即将窥见厨房之际转过身，开始倒着走。"真嗣，你请我吃冰淇淋，真是太贴心了，对吧？"

Shinji froze for a split second, before realising what Asuka was doing. "No problem, Asuka."
真嗣愣了一瞬，随即明白明日香在做什么。“没事，明日香。”

Asuka nodded and turned around again. "Thing is now I want mo-"
明日香点头后，又转了回去。“其实，我现在想要更多——”

"SURPRISE!" 惊喜！

He had to hand it to Asuka; she did a good job of pretending that it really was a surprise. She recoiled at the unexpected shout, brought up a hand to her chest as if to quell its hammering, and the look of shock on her face might have actually been genuine. Then came the chorus of 'Happy birthday!'s, and that look dissolved into one of happiness.
他不得不承认，明日香装作很惊讶的样子确实做得不错。她对突如其来的喊声做出了反应，举起手放在胸前，仿佛在平息急促的心跳，脸上的震惊表情看起来颇为真实。紧接着，“生日快乐！”的合唱响起，她的表情随之转为喜悦。

For one brief moment, a fraction of a fraction of a second, Shinji thought she might have been about to cry. But that moment vanished as she stepped forward. He followed, rounding the corner into the kitchen, and realised that Asuka really had been surprised, in a way.
有那么一瞬，极短的一刹那，真嗣以为她可能要落泪。然而，随着她向前迈步，那瞬间便消逝了。他紧随其后走进厨房，这才意识到明日香确实感到了惊讶，某种程度上。

Hikari had gone all out with the party planning. The kitchen had been done up with streamers all over the walls and ceiling, with a banner over the doorway into the lounge room proclaiming HAPPY BIRTHDAY in big bold characters. There was food all over the kitchen benches, including a round covered up thing that could only be the cake, and there was a pile of presents in the middle of the dining table.
光精心筹备了这场派对。厨房里彩带飘扬，墙壁和天花板都装饰一新，客厅门上的横幅用大号粗体字写着“生日快乐”。厨房台面上摆满了各式食物，其中那个被遮盖的圆形物品无疑是蛋糕，而餐桌中央则堆满了礼物。

Most of the work had likely been done by Toji and Kensuke, who looked somewhat tired and dishevelled. Rei and Hikari also looked slightly rumpled, hinting that while they'd pitched in too, most of the hard work had clearly been done by the boys. Pen-pen was sitting on one of the dining chairs with small pieces of ribbon wrapped around his flippers at what would approximately be the shoulders on a human, with more ribbon tied around his neck just above the collar in a bow. There were smiles on everyone's faces -apart from the penguin for obvious reasons- as Asuka approached, even as she surprised Hikari by giving the class representative a quick hug.
大部分工作显然是由东治和健介完成的，两人看起来颇为疲惫，衣着也有些凌乱。丽和光虽然也参与了，但看起来只是略显凌乱，说明重活主要还是男孩们承担的。企鹅彭彭坐在餐椅上，鳍状肢上缠着几条小丝带，仿佛人类的肩部装饰，颈圈上方还系着一个蝴蝶结。除了企鹅（原因不言而喻）外，大家脸上都挂着笑容。当明日香走近时，她突然给了班长光一个拥抱，让光感到意外。

There was no Misato, which didn't faze Shinji considering her workload, but he took out his phone and tapped out a text message asking if she would be able to make it. He wasn't expecting an immediate response, so the phone went back into his pocket. He looked up just in time to receive a glass of soda from Hikari.
美里不在场，真嗣对此并不意外，毕竟她工作繁忙。他掏出手机，发了一条短信询问她是否能来。他没指望立刻收到回复，便将手机放回口袋。恰在此时，他接过了光递来的汽水。

"You, um, weren't sitting around waiting for us that long, I hope?" he asked after taking a sip.
"你，呃，应该没等我们太久吧？" 他喝了一口后问道。

Hikari shook her head. "No, Rei asked the Section Two people down in the lobby to let her know when you two showed up."
光摇摇头说：“不，丽让二科的人在大堂等着，你们一来就告诉她。”

"Ah. Yes. Of course." Shinji was cut off by his phone vibrating. Flipping it open, he checked the message.
"啊，对，当然。" 真嗣的话被手机震动打断，他随即翻开手机查看消息。

Asuka's party is starting now. Will you be able to make it?
明日香的派对已经开始了，你能赶过来吗？

omw brt asap 马上到，尽快

Shinji blinked several times, but the response firmly remained gibberish to his eyes. Decrypting this would require a genius.
真嗣眨了眨眼，然而眼前的回复对他来说仍是难以理解的乱码。要破解这一难题，恐怕需要一个天才。

"You're texting Misato right?" Asuka was suddenly right there in front of him, almost making him spill his drink all over himself. She plucked the phone out of his hands and checked the screen. "Oh cool, she'll be here soon. Wish I could ask her to get some alcohol on the way home, but there's three problems with that."
你是在给美里发消息吧？" 明日香冷不防地出现在他面前，差点让他把饮料洒了自己一身。她一把夺过他的手机，瞥了一眼屏幕。"哦，太好了，她马上就到。真想让她顺路带点酒回来，可惜有三个问题。

"Three problems?" Shinji echoed.
"三个问题吗？" 真嗣反问道。

"Yeah. Hikari, Misato herself, and the fact that even if she did agree, she would just get whatever she likes, which probably tastes like the wrong end of an Angel. Oh wait, four problems. The potential for a damn Angel to attack while we're drunk." Asuka huffed and folded her arms.
"没错。光、美里本人，再加上就算她同意，也只会点她爱吃的，那味道恐怕跟天使的屁股一样糟糕。哦，不对，是四个问题。还有可能在我们喝得酩酊大醉时，遭到天使的袭击。" 明日香哼了一声，双臂交叉。

"...We're not due for one are we?" Shinji nervously asked. "It'd be just our luck to spend all this time getting your party set up only for an Angel to come knocking."
...我们不会这么倒霉吧？" 真嗣紧张地问道。"我们费尽心思筹备你的派对，偏偏这时候使徒来搅局，真是我们的运气。

Asuka tilted her head to the side thoughtfully. "Okay, admittedly getting to smash an Angel's face in would be a bit of fun, but I'd rather just relax, you know?" She turned and poked him in the chest. "So no jinxing things, got it?"
明日香歪着头，若有所思地说：“好吧，说实话，痛打使徒的脸确实挺过瘾的，但我还是更想放松一下，明白吗？”她转过身，用手指戳了戳他的胸口，“所以别说不吉利的话，懂了吗？”

"Yes ma'am!" Shinji replied, throwing a mock salute at her.
"好的，女士！" 真嗣应声道，向她俏皮地敬了个礼。

She grinned at him, her eyes sparkling with mirth. "Smartass."
她冲他咧嘴一笑，眼里闪着欢乐的光。“你这个自作聪明的家伙。”

It only took ten minutes for Misato to arrive, blowing into the room like a hurricane carrying a present. "Sorry I'm late, but being a major sucks hard when it comes to paperwork," she said, before sighing. "Think I preferred it when I was still a sergeant, I could still shout at people all day without having to worry too much about writing reports."
仅仅十分钟，葛城美里便携带着礼物，如飓风般闯入房间。"抱歉迟到了，当少校处理文书工作真是烦透了，"她叹息道。"还是怀念当军士的日子，那时可以整天训斥人，不用操心写报告。"

"Well now that Miss Katsuragi is here," said Hikari, "we can get started!"
既然桂雫小姐已经到了，"光说道，"那我们就开始吧！

"No formality for me please," Misato corrected, placing her present with the others. "I'm off duty and this is a party. I'm just Misato now. Anyway, I'll be back in a moment, I just need to get changed into something more comfy while you get ready!"
别跟我讲究形式了，" 碇真嗣边说边把自己的礼物和其他礼物放在一起。"我下班了，现在是在派对上。我现在就是碇真嗣。对了，我马上回来，得去换身更舒服的衣服，你先准备着！

Shinji noticed two pairs of eyes stuck to the... lower back of Misato as she left the apartment as quickly as she came, and he gave a small sigh. Hopefully she wouldn't come back in her usual 'around the house' getup, or his two male friends would be distracted by her all night. Not that he could blame them; Misato was certainly a beautiful woman who enjoyed... making things awkward.
真嗣察觉到两双眼睛紧随着美里匆匆离去的背影，不禁轻叹一声。希望她别再穿着平日的家居服回来，不然他的两位男性朋友恐怕整晚都要分心了。他倒也不怪他们，毕竟美里是个魅力四射的女性，还总爱制造些小尴尬。

True to her word, Misato was back within a couple of minutes, wearing yoga pants and a blouse. The way Toji and Kensuke's gaze immediately shot back to her when she walked in was like their eyes were metal and she was a magnet.
正如她所承诺的，几分钟内，碇真嗣就回来了，换上了瑜伽裤和一件衬衫。她一进门，东治和剑介的目光便立刻被吸引，仿佛他们的眼睛是铁，而她就是那块磁石。

But soon enough even their attention was pulled towards the main event as the candles were lit and the cake was placed in front of the birthday girl. The song began, Pen-pen doing his best to squawk to the tune, even as Asuka's attention was fixated on the cake itself. When the song ended her gaze drifted off in thought for a few seconds, presumably due to thinking about her wish. She blinked, and Shinji found himself pierced by her gaze for half a second before she leaned forward and blew the candles out in a single breath while everybody cheered.
不久，众人的目光也转向了主要活动，蜡烛点燃，蛋糕摆在了寿星女孩面前。歌声响起，Pen-pen 尽力跟着旋律鸣叫，而明日香的目光则紧紧盯着蛋糕。歌声结束后，她的眼神飘忽了几秒，似乎在思考她的愿望。她眨了眨眼，然后突然间，她的目光穿透了真嗣半秒钟，接着她倾身向前，一口气吹灭了蜡烛，众人欢呼起来。

"Sooo," Misato immediately drawled while the candles were being carefully removed. "What did you wish for?"
那么，" 米萨托拖着长音，在蜡烛被小心移开时问道，"你许了什么愿呢？

Asuka gave her a deadpan look. "You know I can't tell you that, or the wish won't come true. That's the rule."
明日香面无表情地看着她，说：“我不能告诉你，否则愿望就不灵了。这是规矩。”

Misato reacted like the mature and responsible adult she was. By blowing a raspberry. "Boo, spoilsport."
真嗣以她成熟负责的成年人身份，却做出了吹喇叭的反应。“哼，真扫兴。”

Hikari retrieved a large knife and laid it on the table next to the cake for Asuka to begin cutting. In her careful hands the knife sliced through the cake like it wasn't even there, easily dividing it into eight pieces; exactly enough to go around. They dug in, and immediately there were compliments about the cake. Shinji tried to hide his reddening face behind his slice, especially as Asuka practically inhaled her slice like it was a godly feast, but fortunately nobody besides Hikari seemed to notice; she gave him a slight nod of encouragement.
光拿出一把大刀，放在蛋糕旁的桌上，让明日香开始切分。她小心翼翼地操作，刀子轻而易举地切过蛋糕，将其均匀分成八份，正好够大家分食。众人开始品尝，随即赞不绝口。真嗣试图用蛋糕遮掩自己泛红的脸颊，特别是当明日香如享神宴般大快朵颐时，幸好除了光外无人察觉；光对他微微点头，以示鼓励。

Plates were cleared away, and attention turned to the presents. Unable to decide which one to pick first, Asuka closed her eyes and waved a hand over the table for a few seconds before bringing it down on what turned out to be Toji's present; something in a rectangular box. The inexpertly wrapped paper was removed, followed by the lid, and then Asuka drew out a pair of...
餐盘撤下，众人目光投向礼物。阿苏卡犹豫不决，不知先拆哪份好，索性闭眼，在桌上挥手片刻，最终选中了东二送的礼物——一个长方形盒子。她小心翼翼地拆开包装纸，揭开盒盖，从中取出了一对...

"Runnin' shoes," Toji explained, before giving a helpless shrug. "Was the only thing I could think of, ya know?"
跑鞋，" Toji 解释说，接着无助地耸了耸肩。"当时我脑子里就只有这个，你懂的。

"Nice, thanks a lot" said Asuka. "But... how did you know my size?" she added after checking for the number on the box.
阿苏卡说：“真不错，非常感谢。但是……你怎么知道我的尺寸的？”她检查了盒子上的号码后补充道。

"I asked Doctor Akagi for your measurements," Rei answered for Toji. "She was somewhat confused by the request until I explained it was to facilitate buying your presents. She also said to say 'happy birthday' if she could not make it."
我向赤木医生询问了你的尺寸，"绫代东治回答道。"起初她对这个请求感到困惑，直到我解释是为了给你挑选礼物。她还让我转告，如果她无法到场，就祝你生日快乐。

"Oh, okay," Asuka replied, nodding in understanding before suddenly halting. "Hold on. Presents?"
哦，好的，" 明日香点头表示理解，突然顿住。"等等，你说礼物？

Rei's face reddened slightly. "...I believe I just accidentally gave away what some of the gifts are."
绫的脸颊微微泛红。"...看来我不小心泄露了一些礼物的秘密。"

"Meh." Asuka waved a dismissive hand. "Don't worry about it. Technically I still don't really know what they are yet. I just have a major clue." She then proceeded to pick up another boxy present and shake it next to her ear. "...A clue which does nothing to hint at this gift from... Glasses apparently."
哎，无所谓了。" 明日香摆了摆手，显得并不在意。"别放在心上。其实我还没彻底搞明白那些东西是什么。只是掌握了一条关键线索。" 她随后又拿起一个方盒子礼物，在耳边晃了晃。"...这条线索对眼镜送的这个礼物一点提示作用都没有。

More paper was torn away, and Asuka was left staring at four small boxes. Two of them were games for the SNES and the other two were for her Wonderswan.
纸张被进一步撕去，明日香眼前出现了四个小盒子。两个盒子装着 SNES 游戏，另外两个则是她的神奇天鹅游戏机适配的游戏。

"Oh ho, thanks Aida. These are some nice choices!" Asuka remarked upon checking their titles.
"哦嗬，多谢 Aida。这些选项真棒！" Asuka 查看标题时赞叹道。

Misato's present was next; several tops that went well with Hikari's gift of a couple of skirts. Clearly the two of them had collaborated so as not to get something that clashed. Then finally came Rei's present, which looked to be more clothing. Asuka removed the wrapping paper, but halted as her face turned red. "Um... Rei?"
随后是美里送的礼物，几件上衣与光送的几条裙子相得益彰。显然两人事先有过沟通，避免送出的礼物风格不搭。最后是绫波的礼物，似乎也是衣物。明日香拆开包装纸，却突然停手，脸颊泛红，“那个...绫波？”

"I did say that I asked for your measurements," Rei calmly replied.
"我确实说过我询问了你的尺寸，" Rei 平静地回应道。

"What's the matter?" Shinji asked curiously, but refrained from trying to sneak a peak; Asuka seemed incredibly embarrassed and he valued his head in its current place atop his neck.
"怎么了？" 真嗣好奇地问，却忍住了偷看的冲动；明日香显得异常窘迫，他可不想因为一时好奇而让脑袋搬家。

"Yeah but I wasn't expecting... this!" Asuka went on as if he hadn't spoken. "I can't exactly show them off you know!"
是啊，但我真没想到会是这样！" 飞鸟继续说着，仿佛没听见他的话。"我总不能就这么直接展示给他们看吧，你懂的！

"Why not? They are items of clothing just like the rest."
有何不可？它们同样是衣物。

"If it were just us girls here then fine, but I can't let these boys see them!"
如果只有我们女生在，那还好，但我不能让这些男生看到他们！

Now things made sense. "W-well, in that case..." Shinji began, walking over to Toji and Kensuke and putting a firm hand on their shoulders. "We'll just step away for a minute, yeah?"
现在事情变得明朗了。"嗯，既然这样……" 真嗣说着，走向东治和健介，坚定地把手搭在他们的肩上。"我们稍微回避一下，怎么样？"

Shinji's words brought Asuka's head spinning around to stare directly through his skull, but he was already making his exit with his two male friends. They were out on the balcony before he let them go.
真嗣的话语令明日香猛然回头，目光仿佛要穿透他的头颅，然而他已与两位男性友人一同离去，步向阳台。在他们离开前，他便让他们先行。

"The hell was that all about?" Toji asked, directing a confused look back into the apartment.
"那究竟是怎么一回事？" 东治一脸困惑地回头望向公寓。

"Oh figure it out, Toji," Kensuke sighed.
"哦，东二，你自己琢磨琢磨吧，"健助叹息道。

"Yeah, I worked it out right away," said Shinji, dropping his voice to a near whisper. "Rei got underwear for Asuka, and that's not exactly something you show even to friends."
嗯，我马上就意识到了，" 碇真嗣轻声说道，声音低得几乎听不见。"绫波给明日香买了内衣，这种东西可不好随便展示给朋友看。

Toji sheepishly rubbed the back of his head. "...Ah, yeah. Right. I sure as hell wouldn't be flashing a pair of boxers at my birthday party."
透二尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，说道："...啊，对，没错。我怎么可能在生日派对上炫耀一条内裤呢。"

Hikari's voice called out from inside. "You can come back in now!"
光在里面喊道：“现在可以进来了！”

Back in the kitchen all the clothing had vanished, leaving only the game boxes and a pile of wrapping paper. Asuka was patting around in the pile, but looked up as the boys came in.
回到厨房，所有衣物已无踪影，只剩下游戏盒和一堆包装纸。明日香在纸堆中摸索着，听到男孩们进来的声音，她抬头望去。

"Hey Shinji, where's your present?"
嘿，真嗣，你的礼物放哪儿了？

What she asked could have been construed as selfish, but Asuka's tone of voice was anything but. She sounded genuinely curious, and perhaps a little concerned. And the best Shinji could do in response was freeze up in fear.
她的问题虽可能显得自私，但明日香的语气却全然不同。她流露出真挚的好奇，甚至略带忧虑。而真嗣的反应，却只是因恐惧而愣在原地。

Hikari came to his rescue. "Shinji was the one who made the cake, Asuka."
光及时伸出援手。"蛋糕是真嗣做的，明日香。"

"What?" Asuka blinked several times, then glanced at the empty cake dish. "Shinji? But..."
什么？" 明日香眨了眨眼，目光转向空无一物的蛋糕盘。"真嗣？可是...

"His lack of taste sense doesn't matter when it comes to baking a cake."
他在烘焙蛋糕时，品味感不足并不成问题。

After a moment's thought, Asuka tilted her head in an 'I suppose so' gesture. "Yeah okay, good point. Thanks a lot for that, Shinji," she said, giving him an appreciative smile.
沉思片刻后，明日香歪头示意认同，“嗯，好吧，有道理。真嗣，多谢你提醒，”她微笑着表达谢意。

Those blue eyes of hers, like living sapphires. Shinji was positive there was the faintest hint of disappointment at his gift that was gone far quicker than it had taken to make. He wanted to see her blue eyes sparkle. Blue eyes.
她那双蓝眼睛，仿佛活灵活现的蓝宝石。碇真嗣确信，她对那份礼物的失望之情转瞬即逝，比制作它的时间还要短暂。他多么希望看到她那双蓝眼睛闪耀着光芒。蓝眼睛啊。

Blue.

Something went 'ping' in Shinji's head, causing it to shoot up. "Wait, there's something else! Give me a minute to get it!" he shouted before nearly sprinting to his room.
真嗣脑海中突然'叮'的一声，让他猛地抬头。"等等，还有东西！给我一分钟，我去取！"他喊着，几乎是一路小跑冲进了自己的房间。

When he had arrived in Tokyo-3, Shinji had had little more than the clothes on his back and a small bag of essentials, having decided to heed his father's summons as soon as possible. The rest of his clothing and personal effects, as well as his cello, had been packed up and shipped by his teacher, arriving at the Geofront before being redirected to Misato's apartment. The clothes and other items had been taken out only as he saw a need for them, thinking that he was going to get sent back to his teacher and would therefore have to repack everything. But there was one item, one strange item, that never got considered even after the move to his apparently permanent home.
真嗣刚到第三新东京市时，仅带着身上的衣服和一个小包的必需品，他决定尽快回应父亲的召唤。其余的衣物、个人物品和大提琴都由他的老师打包寄出，先抵达地下都市，再被转送到美里小姐的公寓。他只在需要时才取出这些物品，总以为自己会被送回老师那里，得重新打包。然而，有一件奇怪的物品，即便搬到这个看似永久的家后，也未曾被他考虑过。

Hikari appeared at his door while he was kneeling on the ground, frantically searching through the pockets of his luggage. "Shinji, what are you doing?" she asked. "I told you, the cake was enough. Asuka's happy."
光出现在他门口时，他正跪在地上，焦急地翻找着行李的口袋。“真嗣，你在找什么？”她问道。“我之前不是说了吗，蛋糕已经让她很满足了。明日香现在很高兴。”

"No," Shinji replied with a resolute shake of his head. "I can do much better. I have to."
不，" 真嗣坚定地摇头说，"我可以做得更好。我必须做到。

His hands finally found their target: a small velvet box that he drew out and stared at for a long time. How had he forgotten about this? It had sat on his desk at his teacher's home for the longest time, rarely glanced at but generally ignored. Shinji frowned in puzzlement. Why did he ignore it? The thing inside the box was such a mystery, and yet he had never even thought to ask his teacher about it. It was like his thoughts had just simply slipped off-
他的双手终于摸到了目标：一个小巧的天鹅绒盒子，他将其取出，凝视良久。他怎么会忘了这个？它曾长时间搁在他老师家的书桌上，虽不常被注意，却也常被忽略。真嗣皱起眉头，感到困惑。他为何要忽视它呢？盒子里的东西充满神秘，而他却从未想过向老师探询。仿佛他的思绪就这样不经意间溜走了——

Shinji blinked, looking around his room in confusion. What was he doing again? Why was he in here while Asuka's party was still going?
真嗣眨了眨眼，困惑地环顾四周，不明白自己为何在房间里，而明日香的派对还在热闹地进行。

"...Shinji? Are you okay?"
...真嗣，你没事吧？

The question brought Shinji's head spinning around. Hikari was standing in the doorway to his bedroom, looking like she wanted to enter but was afraid to. "Um... what did I come in here for?" he asked, inwardly cursing how stupid that made him sound.
这个问题让真嗣猛地转过头。光站在他卧室门口，似乎想进来却又犹豫不决。"呃...我进来是要干嘛来着？"他问道，内心暗骂自己这话听起来真傻。

"You... ah... told Asuka there was something else you wanted to give her, and ran in here," said Hikari. "Then you took out that box and went kind of... um... funny?"
你...啊...跟明日香说还有东西要给她，就急忙跑进来了，" 光说道，"然后你掏出那个盒子，神情突然变得有些...嗯...古怪？

"Box...?" Shinji echoed, before suddenly realising there was a weight in one of his hands. He brought it up to his eyes and started in realisation. How had he forgotten about this? It had sat on his desk-
"箱子...？" 真嗣喃喃自语，突然感觉到一只手里沉甸甸的。他举起手来，定睛一看，这才恍然大悟。自己怎么会把这东西给忘了呢？它明明一直放在他的书桌上——

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

He jolted in surprise. Hikari was now standing over him, worry etched on her face.
他惊得一颤。光此刻正站在他上方，满脸忧色。

"Sorry, but your eyes were glazing over again," she said by way of explanation, and then pointed at his hand. "The box?"
抱歉，你似乎又走神了，"她以此解释，随后指向他的手。"是说那个盒子吗？

"Oh. Right." He had to concentrate. His own mind seemed to be trying to get away from... whatever this was. It was as if the box were a bar of soap to his brain. No matter how hard he concentrated, it just slipped away. "Here," he said, thrusting the box at Hikari. "Please, take it and open it up."
哦，对。" 他得集中精神。自己的思绪仿佛在逃避...这究竟是什么。那盒子对他大脑来说，就像一块滑溜的肥皂，无论他如何努力集中，总是抓不住。"给，" 他边说边把盒子递给光，"请拿着，打开看看。

"M-me?!" Hikari stammered, gingerly taking the box from his outstretched hand.
"我吗？" 光结巴着，小心翼翼地从他伸出的手中接过盒子。

Shinji felt his mind start to slide again. "Open it, please!" he repeated.
真嗣感觉到自己的思绪再次开始游离。“请打开它！”他再次请求。

"Okay, okay!" 行，行！

Hikari slowly opened the box, and then immediately gasped in surprise.
光缓缓打开盒子，随即惊讶得倒吸一口凉气。

"What's going on in here?" came a voice from the doorway. Shinji and Hikari both turned to see Misato standing there, hands on her hips. "The others are wondering what's taking... so... long..." She trailed off upon witnessing the scene in front of her, her mouth slowly curving up into a manic grin.
门口突然响起一个声音：“这里怎么了？”真嗣和日向同时回头，发现美里站在门口，双手叉腰。“其他人都在奇怪怎么这么久……”她的话音在看到眼前情景时渐渐消失，嘴角不由自主地上扬，露出了狂野的笑容。

Shinji wanted to slap himself. He was down on one knee in front of a girl holding a velvet box. And Misato had seen it. He was never going to hear the end of this.
真嗣恨不得抽自己一耳光。他正单膝跪在一个女孩面前，手里捧着天鹅绒盒子，而这一幕恰好被美里撞见。他明白，这回是逃不掉被调侃了。

There was much, much red-faced stammering of denials and attempts to get the story straight, but Misato's grin just grew wider and wider. Finally, Shinji had enough. He took the box from Hikari's unresisting hands and shoved it at Misato. "Here. Take it. Please."
面对众多红着脸结结巴巴的否认和试图澄清故事的努力，葛城美里的笑容愈发灿烂。最终，真嗣忍无可忍。他从日香手中接过盒子，硬塞给葛城美里，恳求道：“给你，请收下吧。”

"Oh ho-" 哦，哈-

"Misato." 美里。

He didn't shout or get angry. His voice didn't raise above its normal volume. It was the look on his face that convinced Misato to snap her mouth shut in the middle of her next bout of teasing. "Ms. Horaki," she said, glancing at the girl in question. "Could you please give us some privacy? Keep Asuka distracted if you can."
他没有提高嗓门，也没有发怒。他的声音始终保持着平常的音量。正是他脸上的神情，让葛城美里在下一轮调侃中戛然而止。“葛城小姐，”她转向那个女孩说道，“能麻烦你给我们一点私人空间吗？尽量让明日香分心。”

"Y-yes Miss Katsuragi," Hikari replied with a quick bow before retreating from the room.
"好的，葛城小姐，"光应声后快速鞠躬，随即离开了房间。

The moment she was gone, Misato quietly closed the door. "Okay what's wrong, Shinji?"
她刚一离开，碇真嗣便轻轻地关上了门。"真嗣，怎么了？"

"That..." Shinji began, clenching his teeth as he tried to force his mind to focus for five damn minutes. "That box... something about it... my mind struggles to remember. Please... I need to... need to know what's inside but..."
那...” 真嗣开口，紧咬着牙，努力让自己的思绪集中五分钟。“那个盒子...关于它...我的记忆在挣扎着想要记起。请...我必须...必须知道里面是什么，可是...

Misato's eyes began to widen as he haltingly spoke, her eyes drifting down to the contents of the box. She reached into it with a thumb and forefinger, and drew out...
随着他断断续续地开口，真嗣的眼睛逐渐睁大，目光不由自主地落向盒子内的物品。她用拇指和食指探入其中，小心翼翼地取出了...

A silver necklace, surprisingly simple in the design of the chain, but it was what was attached to it that drew Shinji's eye so strongly that he didn't need to force his concentration. A shimmering blue gem, shaped like a teardrop, in a frame of silver.
一条银项链，链子的设计出奇地简约，然而真正吸引真嗣目光的是那颗悬挂其上的宝石——一颗如泪滴般形状的蓝色宝石，在银框中熠熠生辉。

A sapphire. Like Asuka's eyes.
宛如明日香眼眸般的蓝宝石。

"Shinji..." Misato breathed in wonder. "This is... beautiful. Is it yours?"
"真嗣..." 三笠惊叹着，“这...太美了。是你做的吗？”

"I... think so? I know I didn't steal it or anything," Shinji admitted. "My mind seems to keep rejecting it, keeps pretending it's not important, but I've had it as long as I remember." He slowly reached out pudgy little fingers to wrap around the shiny blue thing. He tugged on it, trying to bring it to his mouth, as a woman chuckled in amusement and gingerly pulled his hand awayfrom the necklace. Shinji jumped at the physical contact, glancing at Misato's hand on his wrist then up at her face. His head was starting to throb in discomfort.
"我...应该是这样吧？我知道我没偷，也没做什么坏事，" 真嗣坦白说。"我的内心似乎总在抗拒，总在假装它无关紧要，但我记得我一直拥有它。" 他缓缓伸出圆润的小手，试图握住那闪着蓝光的物件。他用力拉扯，想把它送到嘴边，此时一位女士轻笑出声，温柔地将他的手从项链上移开。真嗣因这突如其来的触碰一惊，瞥了一眼美里搭在他手腕上的手，再抬头看向她的脸。他的头开始隐隐作痛。

"You kinda went strange there," she stated somewhat apologetically. "Did you... remember something?"
你刚才似乎有些异样，"她带着几分歉意说道，"是不是...记起了什么？

The memory skittered away like Matarael deciding not to mess with a bunch of teenagers, fortunately taking the discomfort with it. "M-maybe?" he replied. "But... I can't..."
记忆像玛塔瑞尔一样决定不与一群青少年纠缠，幸运地连同不适一起溜走了。“可能吧？”他迟疑地回答，“可是……我做不到……”

"Don't try and force it to come back," Misato calmly interrupted. "If it's going to return, it'll happen in its own time."
别强求它回来，" 碇真嗣平静地插话，"该回来时，它自然会回来。

"O...okay." Shinji returned his attention to the necklace. Reaching out to it again didn't trigger the memory this time, but there was something familiar about closing his hand around the gem. Misato let go of the chain, leaving it to flop down onto the outside of his hand.
"哦...行吧。" 真嗣的目光重新落在项链上。这次伸手触摸并未唤起记忆，然而握住宝石时却有种莫名的熟悉感。美里松开链条，任其垂落在他的手背上。

"You were going to give that to Asuka, weren't you." It wasn't even a question, despite being worded like one. Misato was not nearly as silly as she sometimes acted.
"你原本就是要把它给明日香的，对吧？" 这话虽是疑问句式，实则无需回答。美里并不总是像她偶尔装出来的那般天真。

Shinji slowly nodded. "Yeah. I just feel like... the cake wasn't enough. Asuka deserves more than a quick snack for her birthday."
真嗣缓缓点头道：“嗯，我觉得那块蛋糕还不够。明日香的生日，她应该得到比匆匆吃点心更好的待遇。”

Misato hummed cryptically. "Well I won't waste my breath attempting to convince you otherwise. Hikari probably already tried." She gave the slightest of tugs on the necklace and Shinji relinquished it, watching as she carefully laid it out in the box. "Do you want me to give it to her, since your brain is being wonky about it?"
碇真嗣神秘地哼着小曲。“算了，我也不费劲去说服你了，光大概已经试过了。”她轻轻一拽项链，碇真嗣便松开了手，看着她小心翼翼地将项链摆进盒子里。“你脑子转不过来，要不要我帮你转交给她？”

"N-no!" Shinji exclaimed, only just refraining from turning it into a shout. "It's my gift to her. I have to deliver it."
不行！" 真嗣急忙说道，差点没控制住自己的音量。"这是我要送给她的礼物，我得亲手交给她。

Even as he spoke his mind rebelled, making his eyes dart around to look at anything else besides the box. He felt a flush of embarrassment as they settled on Misato's chest, and with a grunt of effort he forced the box up to break his line of sight.
他虽在说话，内心却极力抗拒，眼神不由自主地四处飘忽，就是不愿落在那盒子上。当目光无意间停留在碇真嗣的胸前时，他顿感羞愧，便用力一哼，举起盒子以转移视线。

Misato, for her part, either didn't notice or didn't mind. "Considering the circumstances I suppose there's no point wrapping it," she remarked before taking him by the shoulder and gently steering him out of the bedroom.
Misato 对此似乎并未察觉，或者并不在意。她开口道：“鉴于当前情况，包装似乎也没什么意义。”随后，她轻搭他的肩膀，温柔地引他离开了卧室。

Somehow, her guiding hand helped Shinji to focus even as it shifted to his spine. He stubbornly kept the box and its contents in the front of his mind as they headed to the living room, where the SNES had been brought out and Kensuke and Asuka were busy beating the pixelated hell out of each other. As Shinji watched, one of the fighters simply... exploded while Asuka cheered.
不知何故，她的引导之手虽已移至他的脊椎，却仍助真嗣集中精神。他固执地紧守着对盒子及其内容的记忆，走向客厅，那里超级任天堂已被取出，健介和明日香正沉浸在激烈的像素对战中。真嗣观看时，一名战士竟突然爆炸，而明日香则兴奋地欢呼。

"Hah!" she crowed. "Close one, but you'll have to try harder than that to beat me!" Kensuke grumbled something that Asuka diplomatically ignored. "So who else wants to try their luck, huh?" she asked, looking around the room.
"哈哈！" 她得意洋洋地说，"真是险胜，不过要想赢我，你还得更努力才行！" 健介低声抱怨了几句，明日香则巧妙地不予理会。"还有谁想来挑战一下？" 她环顾四周问道。

Whereupon she immediately discovered Shinji was standing nearby, holding something away from his body like he was worried it would burst into flames.
她随即注意到，真嗣站在不远处，手中物品与身体保持距离，仿佛唯恐其瞬间燃起火焰。

"Hey Shinji," she said, getting up from the couch. "Everything okay?"
嘿，真嗣，" 她边说边从沙发上起身，"一切都还好吗？

"Huh?" Shinji blinked as he mentally switched gears. "Oh, yeah. I, um... finally found your present."
嗯？" 真嗣一愣，随即反应过来。"哦，对了，我... 终于找到给你的礼物了。

"Oooh!" Asuka's face lit up in anticipation.
"哦哦！" 明日香的脸庞因期待而闪耀着光芒。

And then there was a sound like a kettle boiling. Everybody looked over at the source: Hikari, who had clapped a hand over her mouth too late to stop the involuntary sound.
紧接着，响起了一阵类似水壶沸腾的声音。大家的目光都投向了声源——光，她虽然及时捂住了嘴，但还是没能阻止那不由自主发出的声音。

A poke in his back brought Shinji back to what he had to do. Just in time too, as his concentration was starting to slip again. He coughed nervously, getting Asuka's attention.
背后被人轻戳一下，真嗣这才想起自己该做的事。幸好及时，因为他的注意力又开始游离了。他紧张地干咳一声，吸引了明日香的目光。

"H-here you go, Asuka," he said, holding the box out to her with a small bow. "Happy b-birthday."
给，Asuka，" 他边说边将盒子递给她，并微微鞠躬。"生日快乐。

Wonder filled Asuka's face as she beheld the offering. She would obviously know the sort of thing that would be kept in a box like this. As she hesitantly reached out for the box, Shinji put all of his effort into focusing on the damn box.
明日香脸上满是惊讶，她凝视着眼前的礼物。她显然清楚这类盒子通常装有何物。她犹豫着伸出手去触碰盒子，而真嗣则全神贯注地盯着那个盒子。

He had to remember this.
他得记住这个。

The box was gingerly taken from Shinji's hands, which he let flop back to his sides. His eyes were on Asuka's, waiting for the moment they would sparkle like the ocean in the sun again. Like so many previous times when she was truly, genuinely happy.
箱子被小心翼翼地从真嗣手中接过，他随即松开手，任由双手垂回身侧。他的目光紧锁在明日香的双眼上，期待着它们再次如阳光照耀下的海洋般闪烁。就像她以往真正快乐时的无数次那样。

The box was opened, and Asuka's mouth dropped open in pure shock. Her eyes darted between Shinji's face and the necklace several times before steadfastly focusing on the jewellery.
盒子一打开，明日香惊得目瞪口呆。她的视线在真嗣的脸和那条项链之间来回游移了几番，最终定格在了那件珠宝上。

"Shinji, I-I..." she stammered, conflicting emotions running across her face. "I can't-... are you sure you want to give this to me?"
真嗣，我...我..." 她语塞，脸上闪过复杂的情绪。"我真的可以...你确定要给我这个吗？

"As sure as I've ever been," said Shinji, silently amazed that he'd managed to get that sentence out without stuttering. Asuka was starting to blush now, and Shinji's cheeks began to pink up as well. This was far more than a simple gift for a friend; especially considering all that they had been through together.
"我从未如此确信，" 真嗣说道，暗自惊讶自己竟能流畅地说出这句话。明日香的脸颊开始泛红，真嗣也感到自己的脸颊微微发热。这不仅仅是对朋友的一份礼物；尤其是考虑到他们共同经历的种种。

"I..." Asuka halted, then cleared her throat and continued. "Knowing you as long as I have, I can tell there's no changing your mind about this."
我..." 明日香顿了顿，清了清喉咙接着说，"跟你相识这么久，我明白在这件事上，你的想法是改变不了的。

The necklace was brought out into the open. All eyes immediately gravitated to the gently spinning gemstone, its beauty prompting admiring murmurs from Toji and Kensuke as well as wide-eyed astonishment from Rei.
项链公开展示，众人目光立即聚焦于那颗缓缓旋转的宝石，其璀璨之美引得东治和健介低声赞叹，绫波则目瞪口呆。

And open-mouthed shock from Shinji. Seeing the sapphire dangle in front of Asuka's face drove home just how perfect the gift was. As the gem sparkled, so too did her eyes. He wished he could preserve this scene forever.
真嗣目瞪口呆，震惊不已。当蓝宝石在明日香面前摇曳生姿，他才深刻感受到这份礼物的完美无瑕。宝石的光芒与她眼中的光彩交相辉映。他多么希望这一刻能永恒定格。

A flash lit up the room for a split second, breaking everybody out of the trance. Kensuke dropped his camera from his face, revealing a grin so big it threatened to make the top of his head fall off. "Sorry, I just had to," he remarked with an expansive shrug, sounding not at all apologetic. Shinji made a mental note to ask for a copy of that photo.
一道闪光瞬间照亮房间，让所有人都从恍惚中惊醒。健介从脸上移开相机，露出一个灿烂至极的笑容，仿佛要笑掉大牙。“不好意思，我实在忍不住，”他带着夸张的耸肩说道，语气中毫无歉意。真嗣暗自决定要索取那张照片的副本。

Asuka shook her head, then returned her attention to the necklace. Setting the box aside, she took the silver chain in both hands, brought the ends around to the back of her neck, and secured them together.
明日香摇摇头，随即把注意力转回到项链上。她把盒子搁置一旁，双手捧起银链，绕到颈后，稳稳地扣合。

Whatever strange power the necklace had once had that made Shinji forget about it seemed to be gone. Even without effort it was the only thing on his mind now; the perfect gift for Asuka, now sitting around her neck.
曾经让真嗣遗忘的项链所拥有的神秘力量，如今似乎已不复存在。无需刻意，它已占据了他的全部思绪；这份献给明日香的完美礼物，此刻正佩戴在她的颈上。

"Excuse me a sec," said Misato, ducking between the two of them to pick up the discarded jewellery box. "Just gonna get rid of this. I'll get you a new one, Asuka."
抱歉，稍等片刻，" 三笠说着，从两人之间穿过，拾起那被遗弃的首饰盒。"我这就把它处理掉。我会给你买个新的，明日香。

"New one?" Asuka echoed. "What's wrong with that box?"
新的是吗？"飞鸟反问道。"那个箱子出什么问题了？

Misato was already heading to the kitchen. "I'll explain later," she called over her shoulder. "Or maybe Shinji will beat me to it!"
美里已朝厨房走去。“稍后我会解释，”她回头喊道，“说不定真嗣会先我一步说出来呢！”

The next thing they heard was the sound of something being dropped into the rubbish bin. Asuka blinked, then turned to Shinji, who gestured towards the balcony door with a jerk of his head.
紧接着，他们听到有东西被扔进垃圾桶的声音。明日香眨了眨眼，随即看向真嗣，真嗣则用头示意了一下阳台门。

XXX

"So... a mysterious necklace that made you ignore it," said Asuka after Shinji finished explaining the story to her. "And a strange vision when you went to touch it."
这么说来...是一条让你不自觉忽视的神秘项链，" Asuka 听完 Shinji 的叙述后说道。"而且当你触碰它时，还出现了奇异的幻象。

Shinji nodded, staring out at the city while leaning on the balcony wall. Asuka was sitting on one of the deckchairs behind and to his left. "You now know as much as I do about it," he muttered dolefully. He looked thoughtful for a moment, then glanced at her. "You didn't get anything strange happening when you touched it, did you?"
真嗣点头，倚着阳台墙凝视城市。明日香坐在他左后方的躺椅上。“关于这事，你现在知道的和我一样了，”他有些沮丧地说。他沉思片刻，随即看向她。“你碰它时，没遇到什么奇怪的事吧？”

"Nope, just the shock of you giving me such a beautiful gift," said Asuka, her hand absently reaching up to touch the gemstone for the dozenth time since they'd walked outside.
"不，只是你送我如此精美的礼物让我感到惊喜，" Asuka 说着，手不自觉地再次抚摸那颗宝石，自走出户外以来，这已是第十二次。

"It's absolutely perfect for you, Asuka," Shinji remarked, getting another eyeful of her blissful expression. "I knew it would be a good match for your eyes, once I remembered it existed, but... it's like your eyes were cut from the same gem."
这对你来说再合适不过了，明日香，" 真嗣说道，目光再次被她那洋溢着幸福的表情所吸引。"我一想起这东西，就知道它定能衬托你的眼睛，但没想到... 简直就像你的眼睛和它出自同一块宝石。

Asuka swiftly turned her face away, but it was too late to hide her blushing cheeks. In any case, Shinji was feeling the exact same heat in his own face. "Y-you dummy," she stammered. "That line was cornier than a farmer's field."
明日香急忙扭过头，但已来不及掩饰她那泛红的脸颊。实际上，真嗣也感到自己脸上同样的热度。“你……你真是个傻瓜，”她结结巴巴地说，“那句话比农夫的田还要俗气。”

"Maybe, but it's still true."
可能如此，不过这依旧是事实。

"And that line is just maximum corn."
那句话夸张到了极点。

They both chuckled quietly and returned their gazes to the city lit by a reddening sunset.
两人相视而笑，目光重新落回那座沐浴在夕阳余晖中的城市。

"...Thank you, Shinji," said Asuka after a long yet comfortable silence. "But I hope you know that it'll take more than this to dispel... that fear I told you about."
...谢谢你，真嗣，" 明日香在一段长久的宁静后开口，语气中带着一丝释然。"但愿你明白，要驱散我所说的那份恐惧，仅此而已是不够的。

"I never did it to try and... win you over or whatever," replied Shinji, even as he felt a twinge of disappointment. "It feels like pure luck that I even managed to remember about that necklace long enough to give it to you today. But still, I gave it to you because we're friends and I wanted you to have it."
我这么做并非为了试图...赢得你的青睐或别的，" 真嗣回答时，心中掠过一丝失落。"我能记起那条项链并在今天送给你，纯属侥幸。但我之所以送你，是因为我们是朋友，我真心希望你能拥有它。

Asuka huffed in amusement. "And now whatever spell it had over you has been broken. Don't think I haven't seen you staring at it hanging around my neck. It's a good thing I know exactly where your male gaze is, if you catch my drift."
明日香带着一丝戏谑哼了一声。“看来它对你的吸引力已经消失了。别以为我没发现你盯着它挂在我脖子上时的眼神。还好我知道你的目光所向，你明白我的意思吧。”

More heat hit Shinji's cheeks. "I-I would never do that to you, Asuka!"
真嗣的脸颊感受到更多热意。“我-我绝对不会那样对你，明日香！”

"I know, I'm just messing with you!"
我明白，只是跟你开个玩笑！

Behind him, Shinji heard movement as Asuka stood up. A moment later, he almost jumped out of his skin as a delicate hand came down on his where it rested on the balcony wall.
真嗣身后传来声响，是明日香起身了。不久，一只纤手轻触他搭在阳台墙上的手，让他惊得几乎跳起。

"Really though, thank you again," said Asuka, flashing him a look of pure happiness. "Even without this amazing gift, today has been the greatest birthday party I've ever had. Even if I had to give you a bit of a hand with your role." She patted his hand a couple of times. "But the night is young! Let's get back in there and have some more fun!"
真的，再次感谢你，"飞鸟说着，眼中闪烁着纯粹的幸福。"即使没有这份惊人的礼物，今天也是我迄今为止最棒的生日派对。虽然我不得不稍微帮你一把，扮演你的角色。"她轻轻拍了拍他的手几次。"但夜晚还很年轻！让我们回去继续享受乐趣吧！

Before Shinji could respond, that deceptively strong hand was suddenly wrapped around his wrist like a vice and he was being pulled back into the apartment.
真嗣还未来得及反应，那只看似纤弱却力大无穷的手已猛然扣住他的手腕，仿佛铁箍一般，将他拖回了公寓。

But the smile never left his face.
然而，他的笑容始终挂在脸上。

### Chapter 34 A Mighty Big Hazing

"Sorry I missed your birthday, Misato," said Ritsuko before waving a hand at the window, or rather what was outside. "But as you can see, we've all been quite busy here."
抱歉错过了你的生日，Misato，" Ritsuko 边说边向窗外挥手，示意外面的情况。"你看，我们这里每个人都忙得团团转。

The NERV facility at Matsushiro was not nearly as expansive as the Geofront. It was mostly surface buildings, spread out around a large hole in the earth. Its main purpose was to act as a secondary testing facility, for those things deemed too dangerous to experiment on within the main base. It even had its own set of supercomputers, with the astonishingly original designation of MAGI-02.
松代的 NERV 设施规模远不及地下都市，主要由分布在地表的建筑组成，环绕着一个巨大的地坑。其核心职能是作为辅助试验场，专门用于那些在主基地内试验风险过高的项目。这里还配备了一套独立的超级计算机，其命名颇具新意，名为 MAGI-02。

Since the announcement that they would be receiving Unit-03, the Matsushiro base had gone into overdrive preparing a suitable test area in the hole. Something similar to an Evangelion cage was being built in its centre, below the level of the facility. More than double the usual amount of Bakelite injectors had been installed; NERV was taking no chances after the tragedy in North America.
自宣布接收三号机后，松代基地便全力以赴，在坑洞内打造适宜的测试场地。中心位置正在建设类似 EVA 机库的结构，位于设施水平面之下。为确保安全，安装的酚醛树脂注射器数量增至平常的两倍以上；北美悲剧之后，NERV 不容任何闪失。

Misato gave a dismissive wave of her hand as she looked outside at the activity around the cage. "You can make it up to me by going out for drinks when we've got Unit-03 up and running. Deal?"
美里漫不经心地挥了挥手，目光投向笼子四周的动静。“等我们让三号机启动后，你请我喝一杯就算补偿了。怎么样？”

Ritsuko glanced at her and grinned. "Deal. After this I'll definitely need a break."
律子瞥了她一眼，笑着说：“成交。这事儿完了我肯定得歇会儿。”

"I know the feeling." Misato sighed and rubbed her forehead. "We already had a close call with the transport carrying Unit-03. Almost clipped the second tanker it was refuelling from because someone didn't pay attention for a split second."
我理解那种感受。" 碇真嗣叹息着，揉了揉额头。"我们之前运送三号机时就险些出事，差点因为某人一瞬间的疏忽，撞上了正在为其加油的第二辆油罐车。

Ritsuko made a face. "Ugh. I have no desire to go fishing for an Eva because someone screwed up and dropped it in the ocean. What's its current ETA?"
律子皱了皱眉头。"哎，我可不想因为某个人的失误，Eva 掉海里了，就非得去捞它。现在预计它什么时候能到？"

"Tomorrow, just after midday. But there's a storm brewing in their path. Right now they're planning to just fly right through, but they might have to lose some time flying around if it gets any worse."
明天正午过后不久。然而，他们的航线上即将遭遇一场风暴。目前他们打算直接穿越，但若风暴加剧，可能需要绕行，从而延误时间。

"More good news, huh?" Ritsuko raised her eyes skyward and gave a despairing shake of her head. "If I didn't know better I'd swear the universe doesn't want us to receive Unit-03."
又来好消息了，是吧？" 律子仰望天空，无奈地摇了摇头。"要不是我清楚内情，真会以为宇宙在阻挠我们接收三号机。

Misato snorted. "Well the universe can piss off. We need all the power we can buy, beg, or steal to fend off the Angels. Will you be doing the activation test as soon as Unit-03 gets here?"
美里嗤之以鼻。“宇宙什么的，让它靠边站。为了抵御使徒，我们必须竭尽所能地获取力量，无论是买来的、求来的还是偷来的。三号机一到，你是不是马上就要进行启动测试？”

The look she received from Ritsuko made it seem like she'd just asked her to take her clothes off and dance on the Commander's desk. "Are you kidding?! Before we do anything I'll be going over it with a fine-toothed comb! While I don't want to insult our late colleagues at NERV-Nevada, the fact remains that somebody fouled up over there. For all we know Unit-03's systems are a buggy mess of code."
律子投来的目光，仿佛她刚提出要她脱衣在指挥官桌上跳舞一般。“你开玩笑吧？！在采取任何行动前，我会仔细审查每一个细节！虽然我不想贬低我们在 NERV-内华达的已故同事，但确实有人在那边出了差错。据我们所知，Unit-03 的系统可能是一团糟。”

Misato gave a nod, conceding the point. "So how long will that take?"
碇真嗣点头表示认同，问道："那这个过程需要多久？"

"We'll have the test next Monday. At that point I should either be satisfied that the Eva isn't going to self-destruct, or I'll have fixed the spaghetti code that would make it blow up." Ritsuko glanced down at something on her monitor. "Anyway, have you decided who we should choose as the pilot for the test?"
下周一我们将进行测试。到那时，我应该已经能确定 Eva 不会自毁，或者已经解决了可能导致其爆炸的混乱代码。" 律子低头看了看监视器上的内容。"那么，你决定好测试驾驶员的人选了吗？

"Hrm." Misato put a hand to her chin in thought. "What kind of risks would there be? Worst comes to worst the Bakelite gets triggered and we need to break Unit-03 out later."
嗯。" 碇真嗣手托下巴沉思着，"会有哪些风险呢？最糟糕的情况是，如果酚醛树脂被触发，我们之后还得设法解救出 3 号机。

"Or it manages to escape and go on a rampage," Ritsuko flatly said. "In which case the others would have to take it down, possibly even kill it."
或者它成功逃脱并开始肆虐，" 律子语气平淡地说。"那样的话，其他人就不得不出手制止，甚至可能要将其击毙。

Misato paled. "Shit, didn't even think of that. Are the Dummy Plugs finished yet? I really don't want to run the risk of one of those kids having to kill a friend. They'd be absolutely devastated."
碇真嗣脸色一白。“糟糕，我居然没想到这个。模拟插入栓搞定了吗？我实在不愿让那些孩子冒着杀友的风险。他们肯定会心碎的。”

Ritsuko patted the air with one hand. "That's a worst case scenario anyway," she replied in a reassuring tone. "For all we know the test goes perfectly. Anyway, despite the risks I'd like to have a human pilot in the hot seat. There will also be a Dummy Plug; we've managed to get one finished and Unit-03 will be having it installed. Hopefully between a computer pilot, a real one, and the Bakelite we can stop anything bad before it happens."
律子轻拍着空气，用安抚的口吻说：“那只是最坏的设想。实际上，测试可能一切顺利。虽然有风险，但我仍希望由真人驾驶员来操控。此外，我们还会安装 Dummy Plug；三号机上将配备我们新完成的模拟驾驶员系统。希望借助计算机、真人驾驶员以及巴克兰树脂的辅助，我们能防患于未然。”

"Well... I reckon we should use Kensuke for the activation test. He would end up being its main pilot anyway so that Asuka can get Unit-02 back. Then while she and Shinji are in 02, Rei can use 01 instead of a crotchety prototype."
嗯...我想我们应该让健介负责激活测试。他迟早会成为主要驾驶员，这样明日香就能重新操控二号机。当她和真嗣一起驾驶二号机时，零可以驾驶一号机，而不是那台老旧的原型机。

Misato saw a smidgen of hesitation in Ritsuko's expression for a split second before her friend recovered. "Works for me. Maybe tell him out of earshot of Asuka, or she might get upset she wasn't chosen."
Misato 察觉到 Ritsuko 的表情中闪过一丝犹豫，但很快她就恢复了常态。"我同意。不过，最好在 Asuka 听不到的地方告诉他，免得她因为没有被选中而感到不快。"

"Oh trust me, she'll be upset once she finds out anyway. Nothing any of us can do about that. May as well tell everyone at once and get it over with."
相信我，她一旦得知真相，肯定会难过。这是无法避免的。不如干脆告诉大家，一次性解决。

"Try getting her boyfriend to distract her. Shinji's certainly done a wonderful job of smoothing the sharp edges off our irascible German pilot." Ritsuko pointed out the window. "If it weren't for the fact that we'd be risking halfour pilot corps, I would have gotten them both to do the test."
试试让她的男友去转移她的注意力。真嗣确实表现出色，让那位易怒的德国飞行员变得圆滑多了。" 律子指向窗外，补充道，"若非考虑到这可能危及我们半数飞行员，我原本打算让他们俩都参与测试。

Misato sighed in disappointment. "Sadly they're still not an official couple yet."
真嗣失望地叹息道：“可惜他们还没正式确立关系。”

"Oh." Ritsuko quirked an eyebrow. "Wait, really? They're still not together? Well... in that case it's only a matter of time."
哦？" 律子眉头一挑。"真的假的？他们还没在一起？看来，这只是时间早晚的事了。

"Asuka's past is holding her back. Do you really think she can move past that?"
明日香的过往成了她的枷锁。你真的觉得她能摆脱这些束缚吗？

"I'm an Eva scientist, not a mental health professional. But in my uneducated opinion, if anyone can break through her shell, it'll be Shinji. They're so similar I'm not surprised they gravitated towards each other.
我虽是 Eva 领域的科学家，并非心理健康专家。不过，以我非专业的观点来看，若有人能触动她的内心，那非真嗣莫属。他们之间的相似性，使得彼此自然地相互靠近，这并不令人意外。

"Yeah, their lives are so similar it's almost like somebody planned it that way."
的确，他们的生活如此相似，仿佛是有人精心策划的。

Ritsuko didn't have a response to that.
理子对此无言以对。

XXX

After another round of sync testing and simulations, overseen by Lieutenant Ibuki instead of Doctor Akagi for some reason, Shinji and the other Children were called up to the observation room before they could head off and get changed. Misato was there when they walked in, looking slightly apprehensive.
在伊吹摩耶中尉而非赤木律子博士的监督下，又进行了一轮同步测试和模拟后，真嗣和其他孩子们在更衣前被召集到了观察室。他们一进门，就看到了神情略显紧张的葛城美里。

"Good work on your sync tests," she began, looking each of them over. "Your scores continue to improve each time. Asuka and Shinji, I shouldn't be surprised but you two both rose five whole points from your last test." The two pilots in question stared at each other in amazement for a moment, before they both blushed and swiftly looked away. "Now then, I don't know how much attention you pay to NERV news, but we just received Unit-03 from America. It's currently undergoing preparations for an activation test scheduled for next Monday. Needless to say you'll all be excused from school for the whole day."
她环视众人，开口道：'你们在同步测试中的表现很出色，成绩持续进步，尤其是明日香和真嗣，你们俩的成绩比上次提高了五分，我并不意外。'两位驾驶员惊讶地互望一眼，随即脸颊泛红，迅速别开目光。'接下来，不知你们是否关注 NERV 的动态，我们刚从美国接收了三号机，目前正为下周一的激活测试做准备。届时，你们将全天免于上课。'

Kensuke's eyes lit up, as did Asuka's. "Who's gonna be piloting it?" they both asked almost at the same time, before looking at each other in surprise.
健介的眼睛闪烁着光芒，明日香亦是如此。"谁将驾驶它呢？"两人几乎异口同声地问道，随后惊讶地对视了一眼。

"I thought it was Shinji and Asuka that were the synchronisation experts," said Rei, drawing an amused snort from Misato.
"我还以为同步率高的专家是真嗣和明日香呢。"绫波丽的话让美里忍不住轻笑出声。

"Sorry Asuka, but it's already been decided that Kensuke will be the activation pilot," said Ibuki. "If all goes well he'll become Unit-03's main pilot, after all."
抱歉，明日香，但已决定由健介担任启动驾驶员，"伊吹解释道。"若一切顺利，他将成为 03 号机的主力驾驶员。

"Yeah, besides, don't you want your Eva back?" Shinji pointedly asked.
"对了，你难道不希望你的 Eva 回来吗？" 碇真嗣直白地问道。

Asuka gave him a look. "Well... yeah, I guess so," she sheepishly admitted. "But it's not like Unit-01's been as bad as I'd originally feared. Handles pretty well; you know, for a Test Type." From her tone of voice, Asuka was essentially comparing Unit-01 to a rusty old car. But she was smiling when she said it.
明日香瞥了他一眼，略带羞涩地说：“嗯……确实，我承认。不过零号机也没我最初担心的那么差劲。操作起来挺流畅的，毕竟是试验机型嘛。”她的语气仿佛在将零号机比作一辆老旧但尚能行驶的汽车，而她的嘴角挂着微笑。

"After the test, you two will move to Unit-02 full time," said Misato. "As of yet we're unsure if Rei will stay in Unit-00 or move to Unit-01. Doctor Akagi shot that query up the chain of command but we've yet to hear anything back."
测试结束后，你们俩将全职调至二号机，" 美里说道，"至于绫波是留在零号机还是转至一号机，目前还没有定论。赤木博士已将此问题上报，但尚未收到任何回复。

"Well I hope she does get to use Unit-01," said Shinji. "I mean, she almost died before the Third Angel because her Eva went berserk or something."
说真的，我希望她能驾驶初号机，" 碇真嗣说道。"毕竟，她在遭遇第三使徒前差点丧命，就是因为她的 Eva 失控了。

"I'd like that too Shinji," replied Misato. "Unfortunately there's nothing I can do. It all depends on Commander Ikari's decision. I think getting a Fifth Child is out of the question anyway, considering that Unit-01 has proven to be rather iffy when it comes to pilots that aren't you." She glanced at the two female pilots. "Or... Rei. And Asuka. Although in Asuka's case Doctor Akagi apparently predicted even less of a chance of the Eva activating than she gave you, Shinji."
我也这么希望，真嗣。" 三笠回应说，"但很无奈，我帮不上忙。一切都要看伊卡里指挥官的决定。考虑到零号机在非你驾驶时表现出的不稳定，我觉得寻找第五适格者已经不太现实了。" 她看了看两位女驾驶员，"或者说... 零。还有明日香。不过，在明日香的情况下，赤木博士似乎预料到 EVA 激活的可能性比给你的还要低，真嗣。

"I'm just that damn good!" Asuka airily remarked, putting a hand on her hip as she cocked it like she was posing for a picture.
"我就是这样厉害！" 明日香轻松地说着，一手叉腰，侧身摆出拍照的姿势。

"Your sync ratio does dip while you two are piloting Unit-01," said Ibuki. "Even though Shinji gets a higher ratio than in 02, it's not enough to counteract the drop."
你们驾驶初号机时，同步率确实有所下降，"伊吹指出，"虽然真嗣的同步率比驾驶二号机时要高，但这一提升仍不足以弥补整体的下降。

"Because it's a Test-Type," Shinji and Asuka said at the same time, drawing raised eyebrows from the two of them as they glanced at each other.
"因为这是测试类型，" 碇真嗣和明日香异口同声地说，两人不约而同地挑了挑眉，相互交换了一个眼神。

"Much better." 好多了。

Rei's comment caused a ripple of laughter throughout the room. Once everybody settled down again, Misato dismissed the pilots, letting them finally wash off the stink of drying LCL and head home.
绫的评论让整个房间响起了一阵笑声。待众人重新安静下来，美里便让飞行员们解散，好让他们洗去身上干涸的 LCL 气味，各自回家。

XXX

The day of Unit-03's test came quickly. Kensuke woke up just as early as if he were still going to school, running around the house as quietly as possible so as not to disturb his dad's sleep, to get ready in time. Right on time, he heard a car horn out the front of his house. Nervous anticipation building, he stepped outside to see Misato and her blue sports car waiting for him.
Unit-03 的测试日迅速来临。健介如同往常上学时一样早早醒来，轻手轻脚地在屋内穿梭，以免吵醒父亲，确保按时准备就绪。恰在此时，他听到屋外传来汽车喇叭声。紧张与期待交织，他走出家门，只见美里驾驶着她的蓝色跑车已在等候。

Kensuke held firmly onto the passenger side door handle as Misato raced to the Matsushiro Secondary Experiment Facility. Apparently the other pilots had to simply wait around at NERV HQ in case of an incident. Kensuke could already imagine Asuka groaning in boredom, but in his opinion boring was good. If things started getting interesting, it was either an Angel attack or a problem with the test. Ideally, the test would be successful, there might be some simulations, and then Unit-03 would be declared combat-ready and everyone could go home again.
健介紧握着副驾驶座的门把手，因为美里正飞速赶往松代第二实验设施。其他驾驶员似乎只需在 NERV 总部待命，以防不测。健介脑海中已经浮现出明日香因无聊而叹息的场景，但他认为，无聊反而是好事。一旦事情变得有趣，不是天使来袭，就是测试出了岔子。他希望测试顺利，或许会进行一些模拟，最终 03 号机被宣布为战备状态，大家便能安心回家。

Of course, this was reality. He hoped everything would go well; he expected that something would go wrong.
当然，这是现实。他既希望一切顺利，又预感会有什么差错发生。

Soon enough he had the sight of the Matsushiro base to distract him from his musings. Research buildings scattered all around a large hole in the ground, with a certain piece of hilariously expensive military hardware directly in the middle of the hole surrounded by service structures as if it were a space shuttle. Four towers were set equidistant around the hole, curving towards the middle like claws.
很快，松代基地的景象就让他从沉思中抽离出来。研究建筑环绕着一个巨大的地坑，坑中央是一台价值连城的军事设备，周围布满了辅助设施，仿佛是一架待发的航天飞机。四座塔楼环绕地坑等距而立，向中心弯曲，犹如张开的利爪。

The sports car pulled up to a tall building that sat practically on the edge of the hole, with a gantry connecting it to the service structures. Stepping out of the car, Kensuke was practically blasted in the face by a hot wind, and he immediately made for the cool safety of the building. Inside, with the exception of the windows, the place looked almost exactly like part of NERV HQ, gunmetal grey walls and all.
那辆跑车驶至一座高楼旁，此楼几乎坐落于深坑边缘，通过一座龙门架与周边服务设施相连。健介刚下车，便被一股热风迎面吹来，他随即快步走进建筑内避暑。除了窗户，内部装潢与 NERV 总部如出一辙，墙壁均为冷峻的枪灰色。

"Phew!" Misato entered, bringing with her a brief gust of heat before the door slid shut again. "Bit hot out there already, huh? Good thing you won't have to worry about that in the Eva."
哎呀！" 碇真嗣一进门，就带进了一股热浪，随后门又关上了。"外面已经热起来了，好在驾驶 Eva 就不用操心这个了。

"I'll still have to walk out there in a rubber suit though," replied Kensuke.
"我还是得套上橡胶服才能出去，" 肯介回应说。

"Eh, you'll live." 哎，你死不了。

"Speaking of which, should I get changed now?"
说到这儿，我现在是不是该换衣服了？

Misato checked her watch. "If you want, I suppose. The activation test's not due to start for another half hour."
真嗣看了看手表。“如果你想的话，应该没问题。激活测试还有半个小时才开始。”

"I'll wait a bit then."
那我就等一会儿。

The two of them headed upstairs, where a bunch of people were busying themselves with final checks; occasionally, one of them would look out the observation window at the Evangelion. Doctor Akagi was sitting at a computer by the window, and judging by the over-full ashtray next to her she had been there for quite a while.
两人一同上楼，一群人正在那里忙于最后的检查工作；不时有人透过观察窗看向初号机。赤木博士坐在窗旁的电脑前，旁边堆满的烟灰缸显示她已在此久坐。

"Good morning, Rits!" Misato called out. "How is everything looking?"
早上好，Rits！" Misato 大声问道。"情况如何？

"Hell of a lot better than when we first received the Eva," Doctor Akagi replied, not looking away from her screen. "I'm now reasonably sure nothing will go wrong."
比起最初接收 Eva 时，情况已经好多了，"赤木博士回应着，目光未曾离开屏幕。"我现在相当有把握，一切都会顺利。

"That bad, huh?" said Kensuke. He hooked a thumb out the window at Unit-03. "In your opinion, is it safe for me to get in there?"
情况很糟吗？" 健介问道，同时用拇指指向窗外的三号机。"你觉得我进去安全吗？

"In my opinion, yes." Doctor Akagi turned to look at him. "There's no S2 Engine in this Eva, so no chance of another Nevada crater. We have Bakelite injectors set up to flood the hole if it tries to go berserk, and we can even have the other Evas here in a couple minutes in case we need them. Honestly, even if something does go wrong you'd be in the safest spot in the world. It's entirely possible you'd survive this whole complex getting blown up." She tilted her head to look at him over her glasses. "Oh, and in the incredibly unlikely event that does happen, do us a favour and kick the ass of whatever caused it."
依我看，确实如此。" 医生安吉转过身来，目光投向他。"这台 Eva 并未配备 S2 引擎，因此不必担心会再造一个内华达那样的陨石坑。我们已安装了巴克尔注射器，一旦它有暴走迹象，便会迅速填充缺口，而且其他 Eva 也能迅速赶来支援。坦白说，即便发生意外，你所在之处也是全球最安全的地方。就算整个设施爆炸，你也有可能安然无恙。" 她侧着头，透过眼镜审视着他。"哦，万一那几乎不可能发生的事真的发生了，记得帮我们一个忙，好好教训一下肇事者。

"Yes, ma'am!" Kensuke saluted, then headed over to stand by the window. He stared at the almost completely unadorned design of Unit-03's helmet, noting for the first time how wildly different each Eva's head was and wondering if there was a particular reason for the choices.
"是的，女士！" 健介敬礼后，走向窗边站定。他凝视着零号机三号机头部那几乎未加装饰的设计，首次注意到每台 Eva 的头部设计竟如此迥异，心中不禁思索这些差异背后是否隐藏着某种特定原因。

Time passed, and before long Kensuke was in his plugsuit and ready to head back outside. The wind had died down, but it was still uncomfortably warm as he made his way along the gantry. Two technicians by the entry plug saw him coming and manoeuvred a stepladder into position for him to safely get into the entry plug. He gave them both a salute before ascending, which they returned.
时光荏苒，转眼间健介已换好插入栓服，准备重返外界。风已平息，但沿着步道行走时，依旧感到燥热难耐。两名技术人员见他接近，便将梯子挪至插入栓入口，确保他安全登入。他向他们致以军礼，他们亦回以同样的敬意。

"Comm check," he said as he sat down in the pilot seat.
"进行通信检查，"他边说边坐到了驾驶位上。

"Reading you loud and clear," came the response from Major Katsuragi. "Just sit back, relax, and we'll do our thing here."
收到，声音很清楚，"葛城美里少校回应道。"您就坐好放松吧，这里交给我们处理。

"Initiating first stage connections."
开始建立第一阶段的连接。

"Transmitting pulse." 正在发送脉冲。

"Graph readout normal." 图表显示正常。

"Phase one contact is clear."
第一阶段的接触情况已经明确。

"Acknowledged," said Ritsuko, staring at the data scrolling past the screens. "Proceed to phase two."
已确认，" 丽津子凝视着屏幕上不断滚动的数据，说道："开始第二阶段。

"Full nerve link established."
神经链接已完全建立。

"Harmonics are normal." 谐波属于正常现象。

"Approaching absolute borderline."
逼近绝对极限。

On the largest screen, a readout showed the current stage's progress as a series of red bars that turned green as connections were made. The line of green continued without pause until it reached a bar labelled 'BORDERLINE', where it began to flicker wildly back and forth.
最大的屏幕上，进度显示为一系列红色条形，随着连接的完成逐渐转为绿色。绿色线条平稳推进，直至触及标有“临界线”的条形，随即开始剧烈地来回跳动。

Misato raised an eyebrow. "Is this a problem?" she asked.
碇真嗣挑了挑眉。“这有什么问题吗？”她问道。

"Not just yet..." Ritsuko replied, a hand on her chin. "Aida, please concentrate. We can't quite reach activation. Is everything alright?"
还没呢……" 律子回答道，手托着下巴。"相田，请集中精神。我们还无法完全启动。一切都正常吗？

"Feels kinda weird," said the boy. "Not like... bad, just... weird. Sorry I can't be more specific."
感觉有点怪怪的，"男孩说。"不是说不好，就是...挺奇怪的。抱歉，我描述不出来更多。

"It's fine, we'll see what we can do on our end." Ritsuko took her glasses off and ran a hand across her face. "Damn. If it was going to fail, it would have done so by now. Instead it's like it just can't decide if it wants to behave." She looked around the room. "Any interference? Anything at all that's not exactly how it should be?"
没事，我们会尽力而为。" 律子摘下眼镜，用手揉了揉脸。"真是的。如果它要出故障，早就该出了。现在看来，它似乎就是犹豫不决，不知道是否要正常运作。" 她环顾四周。"有没有干扰？有没有任何异常情况？

The technicians all checked their stations. None of them found anything out of the ordinary.
所有技术人员都检查了自己的工作站，未发现任何不寻常之处。

"Should we just shut down and try again?" Misato suggested.
"我们是不是该先关掉，然后再重新尝试？" 碇真嗣提议说。

Ritsuko sighed, rubbing at her temples in frustration. "I guess we can try. Not much else we-"
律子叹了口气，烦躁地揉着太阳穴。“看来我们只能试试了。也没有其他更好的办法。”

"Absolute borderline reached!"
已经达到绝对临界点！

The sudden announcement froze Ritsuko's hand, and she blinked several times in puzzlement.
突发的公告令律子的手顿住，她不解地眨了几次眼。

"Unit-03 has been activated!"
Unit-03 已激活！

"Wooo yeah!" came the exulted cry of the Fourth Child.
"哇，太棒了！"第四个孩子激动地欢呼。

She finally dared to lower her hand to see for herself. Every nerve connection was active. All systems were green. The sync ratio was a little low, but that could be fixed in time. Unit-03 was fully operational and NERV now had another Evangelion to send against the Angels.
她终于鼓起勇气，放下手亲自查看。每条神经连接都处于活跃状态，所有系统均显示正常。虽然同步率稍低，但假以时日便可调整。Unit-03 已全面启动，NERV 又增添了一台对抗使徒的福音战士。

So why did she still feel so apprehensive?
那她为何依旧感到忐忑不安呢？

XXX

"This is impossible!" 这简直不可能！

"Are you sure?" 你确定吗？

"But the Dead Sea Scrolls said-"
然而，死海古卷中记载道：

"Enough." 够了。

One word from one man was all it took to quell the anger of twelve others. The monoliths fell silent.
仅凭一个人的一句话，便让其他十二人的怒气烟消云散。巨石碑随之沉寂无声。

"Ikari. You can confirm that the Thirteenth Angel did not manifest as it was supposed to?"
碇，你能确认第十三使徒并未按预期显现吗？

Gendo, seated at a desk lit only by a weak light bulb dangling above, stared at the monolith directly ahead of him. "Correct. No Angel manifested. Doctor Akagi spent several days checking the Evangelion and the only problems she found were those put there by the incompetence of the Nevada branch. Coding errors, structural faults, and the like. No sign of Angelic contamination, either before or after the activation test."
源渡坐在昏暗灯光下的书桌前，目光紧锁着面前的巨石。“确实，没有使徒显现。赤木博士对那台福音战士进行了数日检查，发现的问题仅限于内华达分部造成的失误，如编码错误和结构缺陷。无论是在激活测试前还是后，均未检测到使徒污染的痕迹。”

SEELE-01 was silent for a long time before speaking. "This is... unprecedented. The scrolls were very clear on what was to happen."
SEELE-01 沉默良久后终于开口：“这种情况……前所未见。卷轴对即将发生之事记载得一清二楚。”

"The scrolls have been a bit inaccurate, however..." remarked SEELE-07.
"这些卷轴有些不准确，不过……" SEELE-07 评论道。

"True. They never mentioned anything about the Second and Third Children and their... unique piloting ability," added SEELE-10.
"的确如此。他们从未提到过第二和第三适格者，以及他们那...与众不同的驾驶技能," SEELE-10 补充说。

"The scrolls are nothing more than a set of guidelines," Gendo countered. "What matters most here is our destination, not the minutia of the journey we take."
这些卷轴无非是些指导方针，" 源渡反驳说，"关键在于我们的目的地，而非旅途中的琐碎细节。

"...You have a point there, Ikari," said SEELE-01. "But the Angel will eventually make its presence known and attempt to fulfil its purpose. You must ensure it does not sneak past you."
...碇，你说得对，" SEELE-01 表示，"但天使迟早会现身，并试图履行其使命。你得确保它无法悄无声息地突破你的防御。

"Of course," Gendo replied with a nod. "I will ensure that a close watch is maintained on Unit-03 at all times. However, it is possible that the Angel has simply chosen another method."
当然，" 源渡点头回应，"我会确保三号机时刻处于严密监控之下。但天使或许已经采取了其他手段。

"You believe the Angel may attack in a manner completely unlike what the scrolls predicted?" asked SEELE-02.
"你认为天使的攻击方式可能会完全出乎卷轴的预料吗？"SEELE-02 问道。

"Well, considering how many other things have gone differently, I suppose it's possible," said SEELE-07 thoughtfully.
"嗯，既然许多其他事情都已不同，我想这种情况也是有可能的，"SEELE-07 若有所思地说。

"Precisely." Gendo raised one hand to adjust his glasses. "High surveillance must be maintained both inside the Geofront and outside. There is no telling how, where, or when it may strike."
确切地说。" 源堂抬起一只手，调整了一下眼镜。"Geofront 内外都必须维持高度监视。我们无法预料袭击会在何时、何地、以何种形式发生。

"Yes," said SEELE-01. "Funds will be arranged to improve reconnaissance and defense capabilities around Tokyo-3 in preparation for the remaining Angels. And that is all the money will be used for. Understood?"
是的，"SEELE-01 说，"我们将拨款加强东京-3 地区的侦察与防御，以应对剩余的使徒。资金仅限于此用途。清楚了吗？

"Understood," agreed Gendo. "Will there be anything else?"
明白了，" 根渡点头道。"还有其他吩咐吗？

"No, that is all. You are dismissed, Ikari."
不，就这些了。碇，你可以离开了。

"Very well. Until next time, gentlemen."
很好。下次再见，各位先生。

"Holy crap that thing handles like a dream!" Kensuke gushed as he met up with the other pilots after their latest simulation training session.
"天啊，那玩意儿操控起来简直如梦如幻！" 健介在模拟训练后与其他飞行员碰面时激动地说。

With Doctor Akagi giving Unit-03 a clean bill of health, it had been shifted to the Geofront. All three other teenagers had been tested for suitability with the new Evangelion, but while any one of them could pilot it Kensuke still got the best sync ratio, and was thus officially designated its primary pilot.
医生阿卡吉确认 Unit-03 健康无虞后，将其转移至 Geofront。其他三名青少年均进行了与新福音战士的适配测试，虽然他们都能驾驶，但健介的同步率最高，故被正式任命为该机的主驾驶员。

"It's a Production model just like my Eva," said Asuka. "Essentially, you've already been piloting it for a while and just gotten a new paint job."
这和我那台 Eva 一样，是量产机型，"Asuka 解释道。"其实你已经驾驶它好一阵子了，现在只是给它换了身新漆。

"Yeah but... no offence Asuka, but Unit-02 felt a lot more... sluggish to me." Kensuke's eyes flicked back to Unit-03. "This one... it's like it was made for me."
嗯，不过...明日香，别介意，我觉得 02 号机给我的感觉要迟钝很多。" 健介的目光再次投向 03 号机。"这台...仿佛就是为我打造的。

"Maybe they took the data they got of you piloting Unit-02 and made some tweaks to Unit-03," suggested Shinji.
"或许他们根据你驾驶二号机的数据，对三号机进行了一些改进，" 真嗣猜测道。

Rei nodded. "Each Eva does become somewhat... adjusted for its current pilot. During the cross sync tests we went through for Unit-03, they had to swap out harmonics data for each of us before beginning the tests to increase the chances of activation success and improve synchronisation."
绫点头说：“每个 Eva 确实会针对当前驾驶员进行适应性调整。在 Unit-03 的交叉同步测试中，他们需在测试前为每位驾驶员更换谐波数据，以此来提升激活成功率并优化同步效果。”

"I have to say though," remarked Asuka, staring up at Unit-03's head. "This one doesn't really look like much compared to ours. It's so... drab."
不过我得说，"飞鸟抬头凝视着三号机的头部，"这台跟我们的相比，实在逊色不少。显得如此...乏味。

"Says the girl who pilots a bright red robot," Shinji quipped. "Might be just a tad biased there, Asuka."
驾驶着鲜红色机器人的女孩反驳道：“真嗣，你这话恐怕有点偏袒吧，明日香。”

Asuka slowly turned her head around to face him, eyebrows raised as high as they would go. "You pilot the same bright red robot."
明日香缓缓转过头，眉毛挑得老高，直视着他。"你开的是那台鲜红色的机器人吧。"

"Hey I never said it was a bad colour!"
嘿，我可从没说过这颜色不好看啊！

"Neither did I. What are you getting at?"
我也没做。你到底想说什么？

Shinji wisely shut up. 真嗣明智地保持了沉默。

Still looking up at Unit-03, Kensuke said, "Maybe they'll repaint it if I ask. Although saying that, now I find myself stumped as to what colour scheme would be good."
健介依旧仰望着三号机，说道：“如果我提出请求，他们可能会重新给它上色。不过，这么一说，我倒真想不出什么好的配色方案了。”

As one, Shinji and Asuka turned to him and said, "Army fatigues."
两人异口同声地转向他说：“军用迷彩服。”

Kensuke's eyes widened for a moment, but then he frowned. "Good idea, but what type? Urban? Desert? Forest?"
健介的眼睛突然睁大，紧接着眉头紧锁。"主意不错，不过要选哪种类型？城市型？沙漠型？还是森林型？"

As one, Shinji and Asuka threw their hands up in exasperation for a moment before letting them drop back to their sides. Asuka headed off towards the cage exit, sparing one last glance at Unit-03 as she got to the doorway, and freezing in her tracks.
真嗣和明日香不约而同地举手表示无奈，片刻后又放下。明日香走向出口，临出门前再次望向三号机，却突然止步不前。

"Oh damnit," she moaned, slapping a palm to her face. "Now I know what that freaking helmet reminds me of! Those pug dogs, the ones with the hideously crushed up faces!" The hand on her face shifted outward, forming a slope from her forehead out to a point level with her chin.
"哎呀，真糟糕，"她叹息着，用手捂住脸。"现在我总算明白那头盔让我联想到什么了！就是那些哈巴狗，脸被压得皱巴巴的，丑得要命！"她捂脸的手顺势一划，从额头到下巴勾勒出一条斜线。

"Huh?" Kensuke took a few steps to the side of the Evangelion and then winced. "Ugh, now I can see it too!"
咦？" 健介向初号机一侧挪了几步，随即皱眉道："哎，现在我也看到了！

Shinji cringed as he recalled the faces of the poor dogs in question. While some were alright, there were also some with horribly bulgy eyes, snouts that looked like they'd run into walls far too many times, and apparently people had deliberately bred them that way despite the defects such a breed was notorious for.
真嗣回忆起那些可怜狗儿的模样，不禁皱眉。其中有些还算正常，但另一些则眼睛凸出得吓人，鼻子仿佛多次撞墙后的模样，显然人们故意如此繁育，全然不顾这种品种因缺陷而声名狼藉。

"I'm... just... gonna go take a shower now," he weakly announced, no longer wanting to look at the newest Evangelion.
"我现在...只是...想去洗个澡," 他无力地宣布,不再想看最新的《新世纪福音战士》。

"...Maybe I can at least get them to change the helmet," Kensuke murmured as Shinji passed through the door.
"...或许我至少能说服他们更换那个头盔," 健介低语着，此时真嗣正穿过门口。

Asuka called out behind them. "Hey Glasses! Now that you have your own Eva, Shinji and I are gonna have to give you a mighty big hazing!"
明日香在他们背后大声说道：“喂，戴眼镜的！现在你有了自己的 Eva，真嗣和我可得好好给你来个入队仪式了！”

Kensuke paused, staring at Asuka for a moment, before shuddering and continuing on.
健介顿了顿，目光紧锁在明日香身上，随后微微颤抖，继续前行。

Out in the corridor, Shinji set off for the changing rooms, nodding at the occasional NERV employee that passed by. Once he reached the male room he went straight for the closest shower cubicle, shucking his plugsuit and A-10 clips and leaving them on a bench. He spent several minutes just standing under the shower, letting the hot water relax his body. He heard Kensuke come in and start his own shower, but remained silent simply due to a lack of anything to say.
在走廊里，真嗣朝着更衣室走去，不时向擦肩而过的 NERV 员工点头示意。一进男更衣室，他便直奔最近的淋浴间，脱掉插入栓服和 A-10 连接器，随手放在长凳上。他站在淋浴下，任由热水冲刷，放松身体。听到健介进来开始洗澡，他因无话可说，便保持沉默。

Until the universe decided to give him a rather nasty conversation topic.
直到宇宙突然抛给他一个颇为棘手的谈资。

The sound of the alarm was so sudden and loud in the acoustic trap of the shower stall that Shinji had to momentarily clap his hands over his ears until the noise died down.
淋浴间内，警报声突如其来，震耳欲聋，真嗣只得立刻捂住双耳，直至声响减弱。

"...Well I guess Unit-03 will be getting its debut sooner than expected," Kensuke remarked. A moment later, Shinji's plugsuit came flying over the cubicle door.
"...看来 Unit-03 要提前登场了，" 健介说道。话音刚落，真嗣的驾驶服便从隔间门上方飞了过来。

Grateful that he wouldn't have to deal with any physical embarrassment, Shinji hastily suited up and left the cubicle, snatching up his A-10 clips and heading for the door. Out in the corridor, he just barely avoided Asuka barrelling into him as she stomped past, trying to fix her own clips back into her dishevelled hair.
庆幸无需面对身体上的尴尬，真嗣急忙穿戴整齐，抓起 A-10 弹夹便离开了更衣室。走廊上，他差点被怒气冲冲的明日香撞上，她正努力将散乱的头发中的弹夹重新整理好。

Together, the four pilots quickly proceeded to the bridge. Misato and Doctor Akagi were already there, giving out orders.
四名飞行员一同快速赶往舰桥，此时葛城和赤木博士已在场指挥。

"-rapidly approaching the first defensive line, no sign of an AT-Field yet," announced Hyuga.
"-正迅速逼近第一道防线，目前还未发现 AT 力场的迹象，" 日向报告说。

"Let's see if we can change that," said Misato. "Fire a volley."
看看我们能否扭转局面，" 碇真嗣提议。"来一波齐射。

"Roger!" 罗杰！

On half of the large holographic screen, a top down view of the Tokyo-3 bay area could be seen, with a blip marking the incoming enemy. The other half looked to be a zoomed in shot from a camera looking out across the water. At such a long distance they couldn't make out much of the enemy besides a vague humanoid shape floating above the water, and a moment later it was swallowed up by explosions.
大型全息屏幕的一半展示着东京-3 湾区的俯瞰景象，其中有一个光点标示着正在接近的敌人。屏幕的另一半则是从水面摄像头拉近的视角。由于距离太远，他们仅能隐约看到一个悬浮在水面上的人形轮廓，随后这轮廓便被爆炸所吞噬。

The Angel didn't even seem to notice, emerging from the cloud of smoke as if nothing had happened.
天使仿佛浑然不觉，从烟雾中走出，宛如一切如常。

"Still no AT-Field," reported Hyuga.
"依旧未检测到 AT 力场，"日向报告道。

"Any damage to the Angel itself?" asked Doctor Akagi.
"天使本身有没有受到损伤？"阿基医生询问道。

"Doesn't look like it," replied Aoba.
"看起来不像呢，" Aoba 回答说。

"Hit it with everything in range then," Misato ordered, staring up at the screen with arms crossed.
"那就用射程内的一切攻击它，" 碇真嗣命令道，双臂交叉，目光紧锁屏幕。

Enough firepower to erase a division of tanks was hurled at the Angel, only for it to ignore everything as it reached the shore.
天使面对足以摧毁整支坦克师的火力，却视若无睹，安然抵达海岸。

"Damnit, not even a scratch on the bastard!" Misato growled.
"该死，这家伙身上竟然连一丝划痕都没有！" 碇真嗣怒吼道。

"May as well have been throwing spitwads," Kensuke commented, drawing the attention of Misato and the doctor.
"简直就像是在扔纸团一样，"健介评论说，吸引了美里和医生的目光。

"Looks like it's all up to you guys," said Misato, glancing at the screen. Now that the Angel was closer, more detail could be made out. It looked like a stocky black, white and orange-coloured human floating through the air, only with no obvious arms and some short stumpy legs. Suddenly there was a flash emanating from its face, and a cross-shaped explosion bloomed over the city.
"看来只能靠你们了," 碇真嗣说着, 目光掠过屏幕。随着使徒的逼近, 其形态愈发清晰。它宛如一个粗壮的黑白橙三色人形在空中飘荡, 却不见双臂, 只有短小的腿。突然间, 它的面部闪现光芒, 随即城市上空炸开了一朵十字形的火光。

Doctor Akagi bit back a curse. "It just breached eighteen layers of armour in a single shot!"
医生阿卡吉忍住没骂出口。"这一枪竟穿透了十八层装甲！"

"What?!" cried three of the pilots at once.
"什么?!" 三名飞行员异口同声地惊呼。

"Change of plan!" Misato shouted. "Deploy the Evas in the Geofront! Get going, kids!"
计划有变！" 碇真嗣大声命令。"在 Geofront 部署 Evas！孩子们，行动起来！

As one, the teenagers all turned and ran from the room. Behind him, Shinji heard more explosions before the door closed. He didn't know much about the area between the surface and the Geofront, but he did know there was something like a couple dozen layers of steel plating, not to mention all the earth and rock. This Angel had essentially cut through two-thirds of that in one attack. Even the Fifth Angel had taken most of a day to tunnel through.
少年们齐齐转身，逃离了房间。真嗣身后传来更多爆炸声，直到门扉紧闭。他对地表与 Geofront 之间的地带了解不多，但清楚那里有数十层钢板防护，更别提厚重的土石了。这个使徒竟一击就贯穿了近三分之二的防御层。相比之下，第五使徒当初可是耗费了将近一整天才打通的。

Could even an AT-Field repel firepower of that magnitude?
连 AT 力场都能抵御那种规模的火力吗？

XXX

Mere minutes later, three Evangelions stood in a line in front of the NERV pyramid, weapons stuck into the ground all around them. The only thing missing from the armada was the Positron Cannon, and that was only because there was no time to set up even a rudimentary power source for it.
短短几分钟后，三台福音战士便并肩立于 NERV 金字塔前，四周插满了武器。舰队中唯一缺席的是正电子炮，原因仅在于来不及为其建立最基本的能源供应。

All three Evangelions raised their weapons to aim at the buildings hanging from the ceiling. A second later the ceiling exploded, obscuring the Angel's entry with a massive smoke cloud as several buildings fell to the ground below. The Angel followed a moment later, emerging from the smoke head first before reorienting itself as it floated downwards.
三台福音战士齐齐举起武器，对准悬挂在天花板上的建筑。刹那间，天花板轰然炸裂，浓密的烟雾云遮掩了天使的降临，几座建筑随之轰然坠地。天使紧接着现身，从烟雾中头部先探出，随后在缓缓下落中调整了身姿。

Everybody opened fire on the Angel, given the designation 'Zeruel' by the MAGI. As one weapon ran dry, another was picked up to replace it. Bullets, cannon shells and rockets filled the air between the Evangelions and Zeruel, accompanied by what little static defenses the Geofront had. All of it may as well have been bugs attacking a mountain for all the effect it had on Zeruel. It floated in place, taking everything thrown at it with not even a scratch to show for the defender's efforts. It seemed perfectly content to just sit there while NERV burned through their arsenal.
众人向 MAGI 所称的“Zeruel”天使发起猛攻。每当一种武器弹药耗尽，便迅速换上另一种。子弹、炮弹与火箭在 EVA 与 Zeruel 间交织，Geofront 的静态防御也尽力支援。然而，这一切对 Zeruel 而言，犹如虫蚁撼山，毫无作用。它悬浮不动，任凭攻击如雨，却毫发无损。仿佛乐于坐视，任由 NERV 耗尽弹药。

And it still wasn't bothering to raise its AT-Field, even as Unit-02 fired a rocket the size of a truck at it.
即便 2 号机发射了一枚如卡车般巨大的火箭，它依旧不屑于展开 AT 力场。

"What the hell is that thing made of?" Asuka angrily muttered, tossing the launcher aside. "Misato, this isn't working! Can we just move to melee already?"
这玩意儿究竟是什么做的？" 明日香气愤地嘟囔着，随手将发射器抛开。"美里，这招不管用！我们干脆直接近战吧？

"Negative, remain at range until you've exhausted all your ammunition," was the stoic response from the command centre.
"不行，继续保持距离，直到你的弹药全部耗尽，"指挥中心冷静地回应道。

Asuka huffed. "Artillery doesn't work, our own guns don't work, what are we even trying to do at this point besides waste time and money?"
明日香气愤地说：“炮兵不起作用，连我们的枪械也失灵了，我们现在除了浪费时间和金钱，究竟还在尝试什么？”

"Less chatter." 少说闲话。

Shinji sighed in sync with Asuka as Unit-02 hoisted a rocket launcher in each hand and continued firing.
真嗣和明日香不约而同地叹息，二号机左右手各举一支火箭发射器，持续射击。

"Almost out of guns myself," said Kensuke.
"我手头的枪也快用完了，"肯介说道。

"Same here," added Rei. "我也是，" 雷补充说。

"Once you're completely out, grab a melee weapon and hold position," Misato ordered. "Let it come to you then encircle it."
一旦彻底撤离，拿起近战武器并守住位置，" 碇真嗣指示道。"引诱它过来，再将其包围。

Half a minute later, the last gun hit the ground. Unit-02 picked up a Sonic Glaive, a long spear-like weapon with something similar to a Progressive Knife on the business end. Unit-03 chose some sort of large axe, while Unit-00 made do with a pair of Progressive Knives. Weapons in hand, the Evangelions stood and waited for Zeruel to approach.
半分钟后，最后一门炮坠地。二号机捡起一把音速长矛，这把长矛状武器的尖端装有类似前进式刀具的装置。三号机挑选了一把巨型战斧，而零号机则配备了一对前进式刀具。装备就绪，这些福音战士静立原地，等待塞路尔逼近。

Zeruel, for his part, stayed right where he was.
至于零号机，它始终未曾移动。

"...Uh, is he going to attack or what?" asked Shinji.
"...呃，他这是要攻击吗？" 新二疑惑地问道。

Asuka growled deep in her throat. "If he was a human I'd swear he was pretending to have fallen asleep."
明日香喉咙里发出低沉的咆哮：“要是他是人，我肯定认为他在装睡。”

Kensuke spoke up. "So what now? Do we stay or advance?"
健介发言道："接下来怎么做？我们该留下还是继续前进？"

"...Alright," replied Misato after a long silence. "Unit-02, advance first, and keep your AT-Field up. You've seen what it's capable of, but you're the one with the strongest defense. Rei and Kensuke, stay behind them until you get within melee range."
...好吧，" 美里在长时间的沉默后回应道。"二号机，你先上，保持 AT 力场。你已见识过它的威力，但你的防御力最强。绫波和健介，你们跟在后面，直到能近身作战。

All four teenagers announced their confirmation of the order and Unit-02 began to walk towards Zeruel, Unit-00 and Unit-03 tucking themselves in right behind.
四名少年确认订单后，Unit-02 迈步向 Zeruel 前进，Unit-00 和 Unit-03 紧跟其后。

At the same time, Zeruel began to float towards them.
同时，零号机开始向他们缓缓漂浮。

"Oh?" Asuka remarked with a raised eyebrow. "Now you're approaching us?"
哦？" 明日香挑眉道，"现在你这是要过来吗？

"Good," said Kensuke. "Now we can beat the sh-... wait, what's going on?!"
好的，" 肯介说道，"现在我们能打败那... 等等，这是怎么了?!

Shinji glanced at the comm window. Something was happening in Kensuke's entry plug. A white device of some sort was lowering into view over the pilot seat.
真嗣瞥向通讯窗口，注意到健介的插入栓内有所动静。一个白色的装置正缓缓下降，映入眼帘，恰好悬停在驾驶座上方。

"What the hell is this?!" Kensuke exclaimed in shock. "I'm being cut off from the Eva!"
这到底是什么情况？！" 健介惊呼道，"我与 Eva 的联系被切断了！

Unit-02 looked over its shoulder to see that Unit-03 was slumped over, looking like it had lost power.
单元 02 回头望去，只见单元 03 无力地垂着头，仿佛失去了动力。

"Who activated the Dummy Plug?!" Doctor Akagi shouted. "Shut it down now!"
是谁启动了 Dummy Plug?!" 赤木医生大声质问。"立刻关闭它！

"It wasn't us! Something's in the system! The override code isn't getting through!"
不是我们干的！系统中似乎有异常！重置代码无法生效！

"Pattern Orange detected! It's... it's inside Unit-03!"
检测到橙色预警！它...它就在 03 单元内部！

"Did that Angel somehow infect the Eva?"
那个天使是否以某种方式感染了伊娃？

"Negative, no energy emissions were detected from it!"
没有检测到它有任何能量排放，这是负面消息！

Unit-03 began to jerk back to life, looking like a marionette that was missing some strings. Unit-00 turned to fully face the rogue Evangelion. "I will help Aida," said Rei. "Shinji, Asuka. You deal with the other one."
三号机开始抽搐着恢复生机，宛如一个缺了几根线的提线木偶。零号机完全转向，正面对着这个失控的福音战士。“我会去帮助相田，”绫波说道。“真嗣，明日香，你们去处理另一个。”

Looking forward, Shinji saw that Zeruel was still advancing. "Are you sure, Rei? If an Angel is in Unit-03 then-"
向前望去，真嗣发现力天使 Zeruel 依旧在逼近。“你真的确定吗，绫波？如果使徒在三号机里的话——”

"Have faith in me. I will help Aida," Rei repeated. "Get going."
相信我，我会帮助艾达。" 雷再次强调，"快去吧。

"...Fine, Wondergirl, but if you get in trouble I'm coming back there," said Asuka.
"...好吧，神奇女孩，万一你遇到麻烦，我会立刻回去的。" 阿苏卡说道。

"Understood." 明白了。

The two pilots of Unit-02 turned their attention on the approaching threat. "Well now," Asuka remarked. "Let's deal with this asshole quickly so we can help Wondergirl. Ready, Shinji?"
二号机的两位飞行员将目光投向逼近的威胁。"那么现在，"明日香开口道，"我们赶紧收拾掉这家伙，好去支援那位奇迹少女。准备好了吗，真嗣？"

Shinji tightened his grip on his controls. "I'm right with you, Asuka."
真嗣紧握操纵杆，回应道：“我就在你身边，明日香。”

Unit-02 surged forward, its two pilots easily falling into synchronisation with each other as well as Unit-02. As they advanced, something unfurled from the 'shoulders' of Zeruel to flop on the ground and trail behind it.
二号机迅猛前进，两位驾驶员迅速与彼此及二号机达成同步。在推进过程中，Zeruel 的肩部展开了一物，垂落地面，拖行其后。

"...Paper arms?" Asuka wondered. "They look pretty damn weak."
...纸手臂吗？" 明日香质疑道，"看上去真是弱不禁风。

"I doubt it," said Shinji. "Probably something clever up its sleeves."
我对此表示怀疑，" 真嗣说道。"它可能暗藏玄机。

"Har har." 笑一笑。

The arms began to undulate before folding back up into Zeruel's body. A second later they shot forward, impacting so hard against Unit-02's AT-Field that the Evangelion was forced to a halt, even sliding backwards a few paces.
手臂起初波动，接着缩回扎基尔体内。转眼间，它们迅猛前冲，重重撞击在二号机的绝对领域上，导致该使徒不仅停顿，还向后滑退了几步。

"Holy shit that was strong!" Asuka exclaimed.
"天啊，那可真够劲儿！" 明日香惊叹道。

"Asuka, look at those arms!" said Shinji, noticing what was happening to the trees and ground that the arms were now brushing against as they returned to Zeruel. Even the slightest touch was like a massive razor blade, cleanly slicing through wood, dirt, and even a road like they were made of tissue paper.
"Asuka，看那些手臂！" 真嗣惊呼，他发现这些手臂正拂过树木和地面，向 Zeruel 归去。哪怕是最轻的触碰，也像巨型剃刀般锋利，轻易切开木头、泥土，乃至道路，仿佛它们不过是薄纸一张。

"Wanna bet that'll go right through our armour too?" Asuka murmured.
"敢不敢赌，那东西也能穿透我们的装甲？" 明日香轻声嘀咕。

"I have a feeling there's nothing that would stop them besides our AT-Field," said Shinji. "And even then, all it would have to do is hit us a few times in a row to break through."
我总觉得，除了我们的 AT 力场，他们似乎无可阻挡。" 碇真嗣说道，"即便有 AT 力场，他们只要连续攻击几次，就能打破我们的防线。

"Then we don't get hit."
这样我们就不会受到打击。

Unit-02 rolled its shoulders, shifted its grip on the Sonic Glaive, then charged forward once again. Zeruel's arms flew towards them, but the Evangelion swerved to one side. By now they had almost reached Zeruel; its core was clearly exposed on its stomach, and Unit-02 angled the Glaive towards it.
二号机活动了一下肩膀，调整了音速矛的握法，随即再次发起冲锋。Zeruel 的手臂猛然袭来，但福音战士机敏地向一旁闪避。此刻，他们已逼近 Zeruel，其核心在腹部暴露无遗，二号机瞄准核心，将矛尖对准了目标。

"This is the-" Shinji began.
真嗣开口道：“这是-

"- end for you-" Asuka continued.
明日香接着说：“- 对你而言，已经结束了。”

"-you son of a bitch!" they finished together as they thrust the Glaive forwards.
"你这混蛋！"他们齐声怒吼，猛地将长矛刺向前方。

Zeruel's AT-Field finally flared into life, but Unit-02's own barrier was like a blowtorch melting it away. The Glaive hit the core and-
零号机的绝对领域终于启动，然而二号机的屏障却如同喷火器一般将其迅速消融。长矛随即命中核心，紧接着-

Some sort of dome closed over the red sphere at the absolute last second, stopping the Glaive's momentum dead. The shaft snapped in two, unable to withstand the built up kinetic energy. A split second later, Unit-02's bulk slammed into Zeruel's body, sending it flying backwards as the quick-thinking pilots turned the aborted spear thrust into a tackle. Entangled, the two colossi slid across the ground for several hundred meters, kicking up tons of dirt.
在最后关头，一个圆顶状结构覆盖了红色球体，完全遏制了 Glaive 的冲势。长矛因承受不住累积的动能而断裂。刹那间，Unit-02 的庞大身躯猛烈撞击 Zeruel，将其撞飞，驾驶员机敏地将失败的突刺转变为冲撞。两尊巨型机体纠缠着滑行数百米，掀起滚滚尘土。

Before they could even come to a stop, Unit-02 was laying into Zeruel, smashing red fists into its face over and over. One of Zeruel's arms shot out wildly, barely missing Unit-02's right arm but still slicing right through the side of the Evangelion's stomach.
他们还未来得及停稳，二号机便已向 Zeruel 发起猛攻，用赤红的拳头连连重击其面庞。Zeruel 的一臂猛然挥出，虽未击中二号机的右臂，却仍划破了该使徒腹侧。

Both pilots screamed in pain, clapping a hand over their sides as their high sync ratios came back to bite them. That moment's distraction was all Zeruel needed to wrap an arm around Unit-02's torso and hurl it away. The Evangelion tumbled gracelessly through the air before smashing into the wall of the Geofront and falling to the ground in an undignified heap.
两位驾驶员因剧痛而尖叫，一手捂住身体两侧，他们的高同步率此刻反噬其身。这一瞬间的分神，正是 Zeruel 所需要的，它迅速用一只手臂缠住二号机躯干，将其猛掷出去。二号机在空中狼狈翻滚，最终重重撞上 Geofront 的墙壁，随后以一种不体面的姿态坠落地面。

Fighting through the pain, Shinji forced his eyes open to see Zeruel slowly advancing, its arms flailing about on either side, churning up the ground as the Angel roared. Beyond, he could just barely see the other two Evangelions fighting each other. Unit-03 had somehow grown two more arms and was sweeping them about, preventing Rei from being able getting close with Unit-00's knives. The best she could do was slice at the arms, which wasn't achieving much.
强忍痛楚，真嗣勉强睁开双眼，只见零号机正步步逼近，双臂在两侧狂乱挥舞，掀起尘土，伴随着天使的怒吼。远处，他隐约看见另外两台福音战士正激烈交战。三号机不知何故多出了两条手臂，正挥动着它们，使零号机无法持刀近身。零号机只能尽力切割那些手臂，但收效甚微。

Their fight moved behind Zeruel, and Shinji turned his attention back to it. As much as he wished he could run over there and help Rei and Kensuke, there was a much more immediate threat to deal with.
战斗转移到了零号机背后，真嗣的注意力也随之转回。他虽渴望前去支援绫波和健介，但更紧迫的威胁迫使他必须先应对。

"Misato," said Asuka, her voice low and deadly. "Disable the safeties. We need that extra sync now."
美里，" 阿苏卡低声说道，语气中带着不容置疑的坚决，"关闭安全系统。我们必须立即提高同步率。

Shinji inhaled sharply in surprise. He had almost completely forgotten that their maximum sync ratio was being throttled for their own safety. Had they already reached what was normally their limit?
真嗣惊讶得倒吸一口凉气。他差点忘了，出于安全考虑，他们的最大同步率已被限制。难道他们已经触及了往常的极限？

"...Are you sure?" Misato sounded worried; not something that generally happened on duty even in the midst of combat. "You know what that would do to you and Shinji."
...你真的确定吗？" 美里的声音透露出担忧，这种情况即使在战斗中也难得一见。"你清楚那对你和真嗣会有怎样的影响。

"We can deal with that after this bastard is dead and buried. It has to die now; no telling how long Rei can fend off Unit-03."
等这祸害一死，我们再处理后续事宜。它必须现在就消失，谁也说不准零号机还能撑多久对抗三号机。

"...Understood. Rits?" ...明白了。Rits，对吧？

"Already working on it. Dual entry plug safety systems disabled in three, two, one..."
正在操作中。双入口插头安全系统将在倒数三、二、一后关闭...

Boiling ice assaulted Shinji's abdomen as he felt the full force of Unit-02's pain, but she set her jaw and refused to cry out. Already he could feel his mind begin to meld, two becoming one as they focused on one single goal: defeating the enemy. Unit-02 punched the ground and used that arm to lever themself back to their feet. A shoulder pylon opened up and the Progressive Knife within was retrieved.
滚烫的冰块重重撞击真嗣的腹部，他深切体会到二号机的剧痛，然而她紧咬牙关，强忍着不发出任何声音。此刻，他的意识开始与二号机融合，两者合为一体，共同聚焦于一个目标：战胜敌人。二号机猛击地面，借助那只手臂的力量重新站起。肩部的支架随即展开，从中抽出了渐进式刀具。

Zeruel halted. Its arms folded up into its body and the Angel leaned forward slightly as it prepared for its next attack. Unit-02 crouched down slightly, shifting the knife to a reverse grip. They dug their feet into the ground, and then shot forward like a cannonball.
零号机突然停下，手臂缩回体内，天使身体微微前倾，蓄势待发。二号机蹲低身形，反手持刀。它们脚下一蹬，犹如离弦之箭般疾射而出。

There was at least two kilometres separating them and their target. Unit-02 crossed that distance faster than they could blink. At the same time, Zeruel's arms flashed past on either side, and red warnings lit up the entry plug. The power cable was ejected without even a thought a split second later. They didn't need more than a minute now.
他们与目标至少相隔两公里，Unit-02 却以迅雷不及掩耳之势穿越了这段距离。几乎同时，Zeruel 的双臂在两侧疾速掠过，插入栓内随即亮起红色警报。电源线在转瞬之间被自动切断。此刻，他们距离目标的完成，已不足一分钟。

The Evangelion's fist met Zeruel's face just as its eyes flashed, and a cross-shaped explosion lit up the sky above them. The force of the strike sent Zeruel flying backwards end over end just as it had done to them a moment ago. Unit-02 skidded to a halt then leapt into the air, flying after their target with the knife now held in both hands. Zeruel hit the ground, carving another deep gash into the earth. Its arms returned to the Angel's body and it flung out again towards the flying Evangelion.
就在使徒 Zeruel 眼中光芒闪烁之际，福音战士的拳头重重地击中了它的脸庞，天空中随即绽放出十字形的爆炸。这股冲击力将 Zeruel 猛地向后抛去，正如它之前对福音战士所做的那样。二号机急速停下后，随即腾空而起，双手紧握刀刃追击目标。Zeruel 重重地撞击地面，再次在地表留下一道深深的裂痕。它的手臂迅速收回体内，随即又向空中飞行的福音战士猛烈挥出。

It missed. 它没打中。

The Progressive Knife buried itself up to the hilt in Zeruel's mask, and it was only then that Unit-02 noticed their left arm had disappeared.
渐进式刀深深刺入零号机 Zeruel 的面具，直到这时，二号机才注意到自己的左臂已经消失了。

...It had not missed. ...它并未失手。

They didn't feel a thing as they punched the knife deeper into Zeruel's face, the Angel thrashing about and shrieking as blood sprayed from the wound like a fountain. They stood up and stomped on the knife for good measure, and the mask cracked in half. As an afterthought, the other shoulder pylon opened up and they fired their entire stock of spikes into Zeruel's shattered face as well.
他们将刀刃深深刺入 Zeruel 的脸部，却毫无感觉，天使痛苦地挣扎尖叫，鲜血如泉涌般喷出。站起身来，他们用力踩踏刀柄以确保致命一击，面具应声裂成两半。紧接着，另一侧的肩部支架开启，他们将所有尖刺悉数射入 Zeruel 那已破碎不堪的面容。

"Quick! Finish it off before it regenerates!"
快点！趁它还没再生，赶紧解决掉！

The shout brought them back to their senses somewhat, and Unit-02 glanced at the core. The blade of the Sonic Glaive was still there, pinned by the domed hatches protecting the Angel's sole weak point. Their foot went up and down again, kicking the blade into the core, but it remained stuck. Frustrated, they stomped even harder, and the blade finally shifted. They raised their foot one more time...
那声呼喊让他们稍微清醒了些，二号机瞥向核心。音速矛的刀刃依旧卡在圆顶舱门下，那是保护天使唯一弱点的装置。他们再次用力踢脚，试图将刀刃踢进核心，但刀刃纹丝不动。焦躁之下，他们更加用力地跺脚，刀刃这才有所松动。他们再次抬起脚...

And it stayed there as the lights went out in the entry plug.
入口插头处的灯光熄灭时，它依旧停留在原位。

"What the hell?!" they shouted. "That wasn't even close to a minute!"
怎么回事？！"他们嚷嚷着，"那根本连一分钟都不到！

"That... was only fourteen seconds," Doctor Akagi quietly said, as Unit-02 slowly toppled over backwards, landing spreadeagled on its back. "You burned through a full minute's worth of power in fourteen seconds without even using an AT-Field."
那...仅仅十四秒，" 阿卡吉博士低声说道，二号机随之缓缓后仰，最终四肢摊开，背部着地。"你仅用十四秒就耗光了一分钟的能量，连 AT 力场都未曾启用。

Only then did Shinji and Asuka begin to scream in pain, both of them clutching at their left ar-
直到那时，真嗣和明日香才痛苦地尖叫起来，两人都紧紧抓住自己的左臂

At the stump of their left arms; the now-empty plugsuit sleeves flopping against their body.
他们的左臂残端，空无一物的插件服袖子无力地垂落在身侧。

Through the mind-numbing pain and their own screams, Shinji just barely heard somebody shout in horror.
在痛彻心扉的折磨与自己的尖叫声中，真嗣隐约听见有人惊恐地呼喊。

And then somebody else cried out. "It's getting back up!"
接着，另一个人喊道：“它又重新站起来了！”

With only emergency power, Shinji couldn't see outside. But sight wasn't needed as he heard the sound of screeching metal and felt Unit-02 get jerked about.
在仅靠紧急电源的情况下，真嗣无法观察外部情况。然而，视觉已非必要，因为尖锐的金属摩擦声和二号机的剧烈晃动已让他感知到外界的动荡。

"Unit-02's core has been exposed!"
Unit-02 的核心已经暴露！

Trying to fight through the pain, Shinji reached for the controls with his remaining hand, desperately tugging on it as he tried to get the Evangelion to do something.
强忍着痛楚，真嗣用仅剩的手去抓取控制器，拼命地拉拽，竭力想让初号机有所动作。

"Nein nein nein neinneinneinneinneinneinnein!" 

Behind him, he could hear Asuka trying the same thing.
他身后传来明日香尝试同样事情的声音。

"Beweg dich, verflucht! Beweg dich, du verschissener Schrotthaufen! Ich werde nicht wegen einem scheiß Akku hier sterben!"
动起来，该死的！你这堆破铜烂铁，快动起来！我可不想因为一个破电池丧命于此！

Something began to punch Unit-02, drawing cries of shock from the bridge. Even though he was disconnected, Shinji could feel something starting to crack.
某物开始猛击二号机，指挥室里传来阵阵惊叫。即便已断开连接，真嗣仍感到某种东西正逐渐破裂。

"Bitte beweg dich!" Asuka was starting to beg now. "Beweg dich! Bitte! Wir werden hier sterben wenn du dich nicht rührst!"
求你动一下吧！Asuka 开始恳求道。快动起来！求你了！你再不动，我们就要死在这里了！

Shinji suddenly felt a deep pulse throughout the entry plug, like a massive heartbeat. He turned in his seat to look at Asuka, opening his mouth to ask a question...
真嗣突然感到插入栓内传来一阵深沉的脉动，仿佛是巨大的心跳。他转头望向明日香，正要开口询问...

Only to see a look of shock on his co-pilots face a second before Asuka... simply disintegrated, her atoms seemingly melting away into the LCL, leaving only an empty plugsuit floating in place.
就在那一刹那，他只是为了目睹副驾驶员脸上震惊的神情，紧接着明日香……便突然消散，她的原子仿佛融入了 LCL，只留下一件空无一人的驾驶服悬浮在原处。

Before he could even begin to process what had just happened, static began to fill Shinji's head, building louder and louder like radio feedback and accompanied by a sharp, rising tone. As it built up higher and higher, he opened his mouth to scream.
真嗣还来不及理解刚刚发生的一切，静电声便开始在他脑海中回荡，逐渐增强，如同无线电的反馈，伴随着尖锐升高的音调。随着声音愈发尖锐，他不禁张口尖叫。

"Gyahhhhhh!" 哎呀！

And found himself staring at a stark white hospital wall.
发现自己正凝视着医院那片苍白的墙壁。

Shinji blinked slowly, the noise gone from his head like it had never been there. He brought up a hand to rub at his eyes, and jumped in shock as he realised it was his left hand.
真嗣慢慢地眨了眨眼，脑海中的噪音消失得无影无踪，仿佛从未出现过。他抬起手想揉眼睛，却在发现那是左手时惊得跳了起来。

That clinched it then; this was obviously a hallucination. The Angel was messing with his head. Looking around, Shinji saw that he appeared to be back in the Geofront hospital wing, dressed in a patient's gown. His right arm had an IV drip attached to it, and he pulled the needle out. As much as he could probably do with a break, he needed to get back to reality before Unit-02 was destroyed.
看来已经确定无疑，这显然是幻觉。天使正在玩弄他的心智。环顾四周，真嗣发现自己似乎回到了 Geofront 的医院病房，身着病号服。他的右臂上插着静脉输液针，他将其拔出。虽然他可能需要休息，但他必须在二号机被毁之前回到现实。

He also had to find Asuka.
他还需要找到飞鸟。

Shinji got out of bed, stumbling hard the moment he put weight on his legs and just barely managing to avoid toppling, but he still ended up knocking a cart over as his arm flailed about. He took a deep breath, shifting his feet apart to help keep his balance, and looked up as the door slid open.
真嗣从床上起身，刚一站立便踉跄不稳，险些跌倒，尽管勉强稳住，手臂的挥动还是碰翻了一旁的推车。他深吸一口气，双脚分开以稳住重心，随即抬头看向打开的门。

The nondescript woman in a nurse's outfit gasped in shock, a hand coming up to cover her mouth. Shinji huffed in bemusement. This hallucination wasn't even trying; the nurse looked so incredibly bland she would have had a hard time standing out in an empty room.
那位身着护士服的女子相貌平平，她惊愕地倒吸一口气，急忙用手捂住嘴巴。真嗣见状，不禁轻笑一声。这幻觉也太不用心了；这位护士实在太过普通，即便在空荡的房间里也难以显眼。

"You shouldn't be out of bed, Mister Ikari!" she said, stepping into the room and putting a hand on his upper arm.
"碇先生，您不该下床的！" 她边说边走进房间，轻轻扶住他的上臂。

Shinji shook it off. "I don't have time for this. Where's Asuka?" he demanded.
真嗣甩开那念头，急切地问：“我没空理这些。明日香在哪？”

The nurse tilted her head in confusion. "Um... pardon? I don't know what you just said. Could you please return to your bed?" she asked, reaching for him again.
护士一脸困惑地侧了侧头，“呃……您说什么？我没听明白。麻烦您回到床上去好吗？”她再次伸手想要扶他。

He batted aside the hand. "Hell with it, I'll find her myself," he muttered at the illusion as he stormed out of the room.
他甩开那只手，低声咒骂：“管他呢，我自己去找她。”说完，他怒气冲冲地走出了房间。

"Mister Ikari, wait!" 碇先生，请稍等！

Shinji rolled his eyes. "No point, you're not even freakin' real."
真嗣不屑地翻了翻白眼，“说这些有什么用，你压根就不存在。”

He set off down the corridor, checking the plates on every door as he passed. While there were a few with names, none of them were the name he was looking for. So this dream was going to make him work to locate Asuka? Fine. No generic, faceless mook was about to stop him.
他沿着走廊前行，逐一查看每扇门上的铭牌。尽管有些门上刻着名字，却无一符合他寻找的那位。看来这个梦境要考验他，非得让他费一番周折才能找到明日香？无所谓。他绝不会被任何平庸无奇的障碍所阻挡。

The two orderlies that turned the corner ahead of him, however, certainly looked like they were going to try. They split up slightly as they approached, covering both sides of the corridor. Shinji grinned slightly as he recalled the Angel he and Asuka had to dance to beat. While he didn't have a partner this time, these two weren't going to be hard to slip past.
然而，拐角处那两名勤务兵显然是打算尝试一下。他们接近时略微分散，各自占据了走廊的一侧。真嗣嘴角微扬，回忆起与明日香共舞以击败天使的那一刻。尽管这次没有搭档，但这两人的防线并不难突破。

He feinted one way then the other, then skipped backwards as one of them lunged at him. Shinji hopped over that one and continued along the corridor, sparing a look over his shoulder as the other orderly began to run at him. Shinji began running too, only to slam into a wall made of beef. Rebounding, he barely had time to notice the mountain dressed in green scrubs before he was bodily picked up and pushed against the wall.
他先是假装向一侧移动，随即又转向另一侧，然后向后一跃，躲开了其中一人的突袭。Shinji 越过那人，继续沿着走廊前进，并回头看了一眼，只见另一名护理员正向他冲来。Shinji 也开始加速奔跑，却不慎撞上了一堵由牛肉堆成的墙。反弹回来时，他几乎来不及注意到那个身穿绿色病号服的壮汉，就被对方猛地抓起，重重地按在了墙上。

"Let me go you asshole!" Shinji shouted, spittle flying from his mouth onto the mountain's face. "I need to find Asuka!"
放开我，你这混蛋！" 真嗣怒吼着，唾沫星子飞溅到山峰的脸上。"我得去找明日香！

"I don't speak kraut, so shut your mouth!" the mountain shouted right back as the boring nurse from before approached with a syringe. Try as he might, Shinji could not squirm out of the mountain's grip as the needle drew closer to his arm.
"我可不懂德语，你给我闭嘴！"山峰厉声回敬，之前那位乏味的护士正拿着注射器走近。新二尽管拼命扭动，却始终无法摆脱山峰的钳制，针尖缓缓逼近他的胳膊。

Something flashed past his vision, and the syringe went flying down the corridor to crack open on the ground. The mountain relaxed his grip for a moment in surprise, and that was all Shinji needed to get free and try to run.
一道影子掠过他的视线，注射器随即飞出，在走廊上摔得粉碎。巨人因惊愕而手劲一松，真嗣抓住这瞬间的机会，挣脱束缚，拔腿就跑。

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

Only to run face first into a pair of smaller, softer mountains. The owner wrapped their arms around him and held him close.
只是不慎一头撞进了一对更为小巧柔软的胸脯。主人随即伸出双臂，将他紧紧拥入怀中。

"Shinji, it's okay! It's me, Misato!"
真嗣，别担心！我是美里！

"Huh?" Shinji blinked stupidly, forcing his eyes to focus. He looked up into a familiar face. "Oh, so now this Angel's brought you along as well, Misato," he said, causing this new illusion to raise their eyebrows. "Can you please just let me go? I need to find Asuka."
啊？" 真嗣愣愣地眨眼，费力地让视线清晰起来。他抬头看见一张熟悉的面孔。"哦，连你也成了这使徒的同伴吗，美里？" 他这么一说，让眼前的新幻象不禁挑眉。"拜托，能放我走吗？我得去找明日香。

"Uh, Shinji? Why are you speaking German?" asked the puzzled figment of his imagination.
"哎，真嗣？你怎么说起德语来了？"他脑海中的幻影不解地问。

"German?" Shinji shook his head in confusion. "Whatever. I need to find Asuka and get out of this stupid, unrealistic hallucination!"
德语吗？" 真嗣一脸困惑地摇头。"算了，我得找到明日香，赶紧逃离这个荒谬的幻境！

"Halluzination?" Misato stared at him for a moment, before sighing. "Oh, hallucination. I should have realised. Hold on, this won't hurt a bit."
是幻觉吗？" 三佐凝视了他片刻，随后叹息道："啊，原来是幻觉。我本该意识到的。别担心，这不会让你感到一丝疼痛。

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji had only a moment to see a hand raise up before flying towards him. His cheek erupted into fire as his head jerked sideways from the impact of the slap. He fell on his ass, cradling his cheek with both hands. "Ow, goddamnit! What happened to 'won't hurt a bit'?" he shouted, hissing in pain.
真嗣从眼角余光中瞥见一只手举起，随即向他袭来。随着耳光的一击，他的脸颊立刻感到一阵灼热，头也不由自主地偏向一侧。他跌坐在地上，双手捂着脸颊。“哎哟，真要命！说好的‘不会痛’呢？”他痛苦地喊着，倒吸一口凉气。

"I think you'll find what I said was perfectly accurate," Misato stolidly remarked, grabbing him by his arm.
"我想你会发现我说的非常准确，" 碇真嗣坚定地指出，并抓住了他的胳膊。

Too stunned to resist, Shinji let himself get hauled to his feet and dragged down the corridor. "Wait, this is all real?"
震惊得无法反抗，真嗣任由自己被拽起身，拖着穿过走廊。"等等，这一切难道是真的？"

"Yep, as real as it gets I'm afraid," said Misato.
"没错，恐怕这就是最真实的现实了。"米萨托说道。

"Oh. Well. Um..." Shinji's face began to turn red, and not just from the wake-up slap. "In that case can you please let me go? I need to apologise to that nurse."
"哦，这个...” 真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕，不仅是因为那一记唤醒的耳光。“那么，你能放开我吗？我得去向那位护士道歉。”

Misato stopped and stared at him for a moment, before releasing her iron grip. Shinji turned to the nurse, who was standing right behind him and jerked back slightly as she received his attention. "I'm sorry for how I acted. You were just so bland I thought you weren't real."
真嗣停下脚步，凝视了他片刻，随后松开了紧握的手。他转向身后的护士，当她察觉到他的目光时，不禁微微一退。“刚才真是抱歉，你太无表情了，我还以为你是假人。”

The nurse got a confused look on her face. "...Excuse me?"
护士脸上闪过一丝困惑，问道：“...不好意思，您说什么？”

Misato hastily stepped in. "He said he's sorry for how he acted. He thought he was hallucinating."
真嗣赶紧插话：“他为自己刚才的行为道歉，他以为自己出现了幻觉。”

"Ooohh, okay." A sunny look dawned on the nurse's face. "It's alright, no harm done!"
哦，好的。" 护士脸上绽开了明媚的笑容。"没事儿，没啥大碍！

"Now could you give us some privacy please?" Misato requested as they reached Shinji's hospital room. "I need to get him up to speed on what's happened."
现在，能否请您给我们一些私人空间？" Misato 在到达真嗣的病房时请求道。"我得让他了解当前的情况。

The nurse nodded. "Alright, I'll let the doctors know that he's awake," she said before heading off.
护士点头道：“好的，我去通知医生他已经醒了。”说完便匆匆离去。

Inside the room, Shinji slowly sat back down on the bed. "What happened?" he asked. "One second I'm in the entry plug staring at Asuka... disintegrating, the next I'm... here. With my arm back." He raised his left arm and checked it over. There seemed to be no sign it had ever disappeared. Every slight blemish he knew by heart was still there, even the long white scar from his unfortunate brush with one of his teacher's rose bushes.
房间里，真嗣缓缓坐回床上，问道：“到底怎么了？前一刻我还在插入栓里目睹明日香消散，转眼间我就……回到了这里，手臂也复原了。”他举起左臂，仔细审视，未见任何曾消失的痕迹。那些他了如指掌的细微瑕疵依旧，连那条因触碰老师玫瑰丛而留下的长长白疤也清晰可见。

"It's... going to take a little bit," Misato hesitantly began, pushing Shinji's legs up onto the bed. "Might as well get comfy."
这...得花点时间，" 葛城美里有些迟疑地说着，将真嗣的腿抬到床上。"还是先躺舒服点吧。

"Whatever else happened can wait!" Shinji insisted. "First I wanna know where Asuka is!"
其他事情先放一边！" 真嗣急切地说，"我得先弄清楚明日香的下落！

"Wow," Misato remarked, grinning slightly and quirking a rainbow. "You've really got a one track mind right now, haven't you?" Her expression turned serious as Shinji continued staring at her. "Alright, alright. Worst news first I guess.
"哇，" 三佐微微一笑，挑起一道彩虹说道，"你现在心思全在这上面了，对吧？" 当真嗣继续凝视她时，她的神情转为严肃。"行吧，行吧。看来得先告诉你最糟糕的消息。

"Shinji... Asuka was absorbed by Unit-02 during your fight with Zeruel. She's trapped within the Eva."
真嗣...在与力天使 Zeruel 的战斗中，明日香被二号机吞噬了。她现在被困在 EVA 内部。

### Chapter 35 Need To See Her

"Shinji... Asuka was absorbed by Unit-02 during your fight with Zeruel. She's trapped within the Eva."
真嗣...在与力天使 Zeruel 的战斗中，明日香被二号机吞噬了。她现在被困在 EVA 内部。

Shinji stared at Misato as if she'd suddenly grown a second head. "Absorbed... trapped... what the hell?" he breathed.
真嗣瞪大眼睛看着美里，仿佛她头上突然冒出了第二个脑袋。"被吸收...被困住了...这究竟是怎么回事？"他喘着气说道。

Misato continued on. "When she got absorbed, some sort of neural feedback pulse knocked you out completely. The Eva reactivated and destroyed the Angel, while Rei... dealt with Unit-03, which we can now confirm was infected by an Angel. Right now..." Misato brought up a hand to rub at her forehead. "Asuka is apparently in Unit-02's core. We're going to be trying to get her out, but the Human Instrumentality Committee want us to put the Eva on ice. Just shove it in storage."
真嗣继续说道：“她被吸收时，某种神经反馈脉冲让你彻底昏迷。Eva 自行启动，摧毁了使徒，而绫波...则处理了被使徒感染的 03 号机。目前...”真嗣抬起手揉了揉额头。“明日香似乎被困在 02 号机的核心里。我们正设法救她出来，但人类补完计划委员会却要求我们将 Eva 封存，简单来说就是搁置不用。”

"What?! No!" Shinji drove a fist down onto the bed in anger. "You can't just lock her away like that!"
什么？！不行！" 真嗣气愤地一拳砸在床上。"你不能就这样把她囚禁起来！

"I know, Shinji," Misato harshly cut in before he could get carried away. "We have a month to work on retrieving her. And we're going to do absolutely everything we can. Understood?"
我明白，真嗣，" 美里严肃地打断他，不让他继续激动。"我们有一个月的时间来营救她。我们会竭尽全力。清楚了吗？

"Well... is there anything I can do to help?" Shinji's voice was almost pleading.
"嗯...有什么我可以帮忙的吗？" 真嗣的声音带着恳求的意味。

"I don't think there's anything even I can do," Misato admitted with a helpless shrug. "They'll be doing some super technical stuff that I can only understand about ten percent of. Unfortunately, Ritsuko gave it to me straight. She's not very optimistic about our chances of retrieval."
我觉得自己无能为力，" 碇真嗣无奈地耸肩说道。"他们要进行的技术操作太复杂，我顶多能理解个十分之一。不幸的是，律子直言不讳，她对我们能否成功找回并不抱太大希望。

Dread began to fill Shinji like a lump of iron in his stomach. He looked away from Misato, staring at a spot on his bed. Asuka had been... eaten by Unit-02, yet was still apparently alive. If even Doctor Akagi couldn't rescue her, she could be forever trapped in the Evangelion.
恐惧如铁块般在真嗣腹中凝结。他避开美里的目光，凝视着床上的某一点。明日香被……二号机吞噬，却仍奇迹般存活。连赤木博士都束手无策，她或许将永困于那使徒之中。

A fate she most certainly did not deserve.
她本不该承受这样的命运。

"Look, just try and get some proper rest," said Misato in what she probably thought was a calming tone.
"听着，尽量好好休息一下，" 碇真嗣可能觉得自己用的是安抚的语气。

"How the hell can I rest at a time like this?!" Shinji retorted.
"这种时候我怎么能安心休息?!" 真嗣反驳道。

Misato stared at him. "...Okay, not only are you still speaking German, but you've been talking like Asuka as well."
真嗣盯着他。“……行吧，你不但继续用德语说话，连语气都变得跟明日香似的了。”

"Wait, what?" Shinji blinked several times. "I'm speaking German right now?"
等等，什么？" 真嗣眨了眨眼，疑惑道："我现在说的是德语？

"You sure are." 你确实是的。

He frowned, looking through his memories of the last few minutes and quickly realising that his guardian was right. Shinji closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
他皱眉沉思，回想起过去几分钟的事情，很快明白监护人的话没错。真嗣闭目，深深吸了一口气。

"Sorry," he slowly said, in Japanese this time. "I don't know why I was speaking German."
抱歉，" 他缓缓地用日语说道，"我不明白刚才为何用了德语。

"That's an easy one, considering your track record," said Misato. "Just before you were knocked out and Asuka was absorbed, we recorded a combined sync ratio of over four hundred percent."
考虑到你以往的表现，这个任务并不难，" 米萨托说道。"就在你失去意识、明日香被融合之前，我们的同步率记录超过了四百。

"Four hundred..." Shinji repeated in abject shock, before despondence set in. "Damn, Asuka would have been freaking ecstatic to hear that."
四百……" 渚薰震惊地重复道，随后情绪转为沮丧。"真可惜，明日香要是知道了，肯定高兴坏了。

"To be frank, it's a miracle you're still... well... you, considering what happened when you were both trapped inside the Twelfth Angel. At least this time you'only' got away with speaking German without realising." Misato gave him a bemused look. "Honestly, I would not have been all that surprised if I had come down here to find you claiming you're Asuka."
说实话，考虑到你们被困在第十二使徒内部时的遭遇，你还能保持原样，真是奇迹。这次你至少只是无意中讲起了德语。" 美里带着一丝困惑看着他，"真的，如果我下来发现你自称是明日香，我也不会太意外。

"Like... a body swap thing?" Shinji blanched at that mental image. "That would probably be pure torture for her, knowing I'm stuck in her body... wherever it is."
就像...身体互换那种事？" 真嗣想到这个场景不禁脸色一变。"那对她来说肯定是极大的折磨，知道我被困在她的身体里...无论那身躯在何处。

"She would literally explode from embarrassment."
她会尴尬得无地自容。

Shinji sighed and shook his head. Then, he remembered that there were two other people he still didn't know about. "So what about Rei and Kensuke? Are they alright?"
真嗣叹息着摇了摇头。这时，他记起还有绫波和健介两人的情况尚未明了。“绫波和健介怎么样了？他们没事吧？”

From the sudden shift of Misato's facial expression, Shinji knew he wasn't going to like the answer.
从碇真嗣面部表情的突然变化，真嗣预感到答案不会是他想听的。

"Rei is... alright," she began. "The other Angel, Bardiel, tried to infest Unit-00 as well. She just barely managed to kill it, but..." She broke off, looking away and scowling at nothing.
"绫波还好，" 她开口道。"另一个使徒，名为 Bardiel，也曾企图侵蚀零号机。她费尽全力才将其击败，然而……" 她话音未落，便转过头去，面露不悦。

"What happened?" Shinji pressed.
"到底出了什么事？" 真嗣急切地追问。

"Unit-00's arms were infested, and it almost reached the body by the time Bardiel was killed. The very second it was confirmed dead, Commander Ikari ordered the Eva's arms to be jettisoned."
零号机的双臂遭到严重侵蚀，当 Bardiel 被击毙时，侵蚀已接近机体核心。一旦确认 Bardiel 死亡，Ikari 指挥官便立刻命令将 Eva 的手臂切离。

"Um..." Shinji tilted his head to one side, confused. "Okay... that sounds like a good thing, right?"
"呃...” 真嗣侧着头，一脸迷茫。“好吧... 这听起来应该是好事吧？”

Misato finally looked back at him. "The nerve connections were still active. And Rei's sync ratio was quite high." She paused, letting him work it out.
真嗣终于转头看向他。“神经连接依旧活跃，绫波的同步率也很高。”她顿了顿，让他自己琢磨。

It didn't take long. "...So Rei practically had her own arms cut off? Oh gods..." he murmured, glancing at his own left arm. He -and Asuka- had lost an arm due to their incredibly high synchronisations, and he remembered the horrible agony that had gone along with it once Unit-02 had lost power.
没过多久。"...这么说来，丽几乎是被迫自断双臂？天哪..." 他低声自语，目光落在自己的左臂上。他和明日香都因极高的同步率各失一臂，他至今仍记得二号机失去动力时那股撕心裂肺的痛楚。

Misato nodded. "Exactly. Rei is stuck in the hospital as well now, because her arms are essentially paralysed. I've been told it's only temporary, but who knows how long it'll take her to recover."
碇点点头。“确实如此。绫波现在也因双臂基本瘫痪而住院。据称这只是暂时的，但她的恢复期有多长，谁也说不准。”

"And Kensuke?" 那肯助呢？

"That..." Misato sighed dejectedly. "That's a different story, I'm afraid. Kensuke was stuck in Unit-03 the whole fight. The Angel was able to stop us ejecting the entry plug, and the infestation got to him as well."
那...” 三佐沮丧地叹息道。“恐怕情况不同了。整个战斗期间，健介一直被困在三号机内。天使阻止了我们弹出驾驶舱，他也因此受到了感染。

Shinji sat up straight, panic in his eyes. "He's not-"
真嗣猛地坐直，眼中流露出惊慌。“他不会——”

"No, he's alive," Misato interrupted before he could continue. "Alive... but unconscious and in quarantine. Considering we didn't notice the infestation until it... awoke, there's currently no way of knowing if it lives on within him. He was also badly injured in the fight, since he was apparently still synchronised with the Eva and Rei had a hard time rescuing him. Not to mention when the Angel tried to eat the plug."
不，他还活着，" 碇真嗣打断了他继续说下去。"虽然活着...但处于昏迷且被隔离。由于我们直到它苏醒才察觉到感染，目前无法确定它是否仍潜伏在他体内。此外，他在战斗中受了重伤，因为他似乎仍与 Eva 保持同步，绫波丽费了很大劲才将他救出。更别提使徒试图吞噬插入栓时的危险了。

"Eat it?!" Shinji exclaimed in abject horror.
"要吃它？！" 真嗣惊恐万分地喊道。

Misato opened her mouth, but then paused and covered it with a hand for a second. "Sorry," she soon said, taking the hand away from her mouth and waving it. "It's just... the Angel did manage to bite the plug. Cracked it in half, but Rei managed to shove a knife into its core while it was distracted."
碇真嗣刚要开口，却突然停下，用手捂住嘴片刻。“不好意思，”她随即说道，移开手并挥了挥。“只是……那个使徒确实咬到了插入栓，将其咬成两半，但趁它分心之际，绫波成功将一把刀刺入了它的核心。”

Shinji leaned back on the bed and rubbed his forehead. In just one fight, three of his friends had been taken out, and only one of them seemed capable of a full recovery at the moment.
真嗣靠在床头，揉着额头。一场战斗下来，他的三位朋友都倒下了，眼下看来只有一人可能完全恢复。

"It's bad, I know," Misato murmured. "You're the only pilot available right now, and Unit-01's the only combat-ready Eva."
情况确实不妙，我清楚得很，" 美里轻声道。"眼下只有你能驾驶，零号机是唯一处于战斗状态的 Eva。

Shinji shot her a dark look. Why was he not surprised she was thinking of the military repercussions first? He grunted. "Well, whatever. Do I have to stay here?"
真嗣向她投去一个阴沉的眼神。她首先考虑军事后果，他对此并不感到意外。他哼了一声，问道：“那我是不是得留在这儿？”

"No," replied Misato. "As soon as you're checked out, you should be good to go. First though, I want to hear your side of the story."
不，"米萨托回应说，"检查完没问题后，你就可以动身了。不过，我得先听听你的说法。

He groaned, anxious to be up and actually doing something, but he complied. There was not much new he could really offer though, apart from describing what he had seen happen to Asuka and the fact that he got his arm back. At that, Misato got up and came around to the other side of the bed, pushing up Shinji's sleeve and peering closely at the skin of his arm. Seemingly satisfied, she adjusted the sleeve before patting his shoulder.
他呻吟着，渴望起身行动，但最终还是顺从了。实际上，他能提供的新信息并不多，仅限于描述他目睹明日香遭遇的情况以及自己手臂复原的事实。美里听后起身，绕到床的另一边，卷起真嗣的袖子，仔细查看他的手臂皮肤。确认无恙后，她整理好袖子，轻拍他的肩膀以示安慰。

"That reminds me, I never said exactly how Zeruel finally died, did I?"
提起这个，我似乎还没详细说过泽鲁尔究竟是如何离世的，是吧？

"Let me guess," Shinji drawled. "Unit-02 went berserk and ripped the bastard to shreds?"
我猜猜看，" 真嗣慢吞吞地说，"二号机失控了，把那家伙撕得粉碎？

Misato smirked. "Close enough. First though it ripped one of the Angel's paper arms off and somehow used it to regenerate its own arm. That seems to be how you got your arm back, although that shouldn't be possible because you were unconscious and therefore could not have been synchronised."
碇真嗣带着一丝冷笑说：“差不多是这样。它先是扯掉了使徒的一只纸质手臂，然后不知怎么用它来修复了自己的手臂。看来你的手臂就是这样恢复的，虽然按理说这不可能，毕竟你当时昏迷了，无法进行同步。”

Shinji frowned, looking at his arm once more.
真嗣皱着眉，又一次凝视着自己的手臂。

"Oh yes, and one more thing," Misato continued. "Not only did Unit-02 rip the Angel apart, it ate its core. Now Unit-02 has its own S2 Engine somehow, and hearing about that sent the Committee into a right state, let me tell you. Once they found out, they wanted Unit-02 frozen immediately. They were almost... panicky?" Misato trailed off, looking away in thought. "Don't know why, considering we were trying to build one before without any complaints."
哦，对了，还有一件事，" 葛城美里接着说。"零号机不仅撕裂了使徒，还吞食了它的核心。现在零号机竟然拥有了 S2 引擎，这消息让委员会炸了锅，你可知道。他们一听说，就急着要冻结零号机，几乎是慌了手脚。" 葛城美里停下话头，若有所思地移开视线。"真不明白他们为何如此紧张，毕竟我们之前尝试制造 S2 引擎时，他们也没这么大反应。

"But that's good isn't it?" asked Shinji. "Now Unit-02 no longer needs to rely on battery power!"
但这不是好事吗？" 真嗣问道。"现在二号机不再需要依靠电池供电了！

"Exactly!" Misato exclaimed. "What do they have against us being able to fight Angels without worrying about time limits?! Something's not right there."
确实如此！" 碇真嗣激动地说。"他们凭什么反对我们不受时间限制地对抗使徒？！这里面肯定有蹊跷。

"I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually." Shinji shifted on the bed. "Is there anything else, or can I get dressed and checked out?"
我相信你迟早会明白的。" 真嗣在床上挪了挪身子。"还有别的事吗，或者我可以穿衣服准备退房了？

"Nah, that should be everything," replied Misato. "I've got a mountain of paperwork to do anyway, but I'll find someone to send your way so you can get out of here. Hopefully I can get enough time spare to duck off home and feed Pen-pen." She headed for the door, giving him a parting wave as she stepped through. "See you later."
嗯，应该就这些了，" 弥薩托回应道。"我手头还有一堆文件要处理，不过我会安排人送你过去，这样你就能离开了。希望我能腾出点时间回家给企鹅喂食。" 她走向门口，临走时向他挥了挥手。"再见啦。

The moment the door closed, Shinji sighed and flopped backwards onto the bed. So many thoughts were whirring through his brain after all he had learned, but one was much, much noisier than the rest. Even the arrival of the doctor and the usual irritation associated with a NERV medical check-up failed to dislodge the thought.
门一关上，真嗣便叹了口气，仰面倒在床上。脑海中充斥着刚得知的种种信息，但有一个念头异常强烈，盖过了其他所有。就连医生到来和 NERV 例行体检带来的烦躁，也未能将这个念头从他心中抹去。

'Asuka's gone. Might never see her again.'
'明日香已经离开，或许再也见不到她了。'

Shinji felt like he had to do something, but he wasn't a genius like Asuka. He barely even understood how the damn Evangelions worked. But the thought persisted, nagging him, seemingly taunting him for his inability to help.
真嗣感到自己必须有所行动，然而他并非像明日香那样的天才。他几乎对那些福音战士的运作原理一知半解。但这个念头始终萦绕心头，不断烦扰他，似乎在嘲弄他无法施以援手。

"Alright, we're all good here," said the doctor. "But for the time being you've been ordered to stay within the Geofront. You can either return here when you get tired, or the bunkroom. Presumably, since you're our only available pilot, they want you close at hand in case of emergency."
好的，这里一切正常，"医生说道。"不过，目前你得留在 Geofront 内。累了可以回来，或者去休息室。考虑到你是我们唯一的飞行员，他们希望你在紧急情况下能随时待命。

'Asuka's gone. Might never see her again.'
'明日香已经离开，或许再也见不到她了。'

"Okay," Shinji replied as he got to his feet, heading for the bathroom door and grabbing his clothes along the way. Just as he touched the door handle, a new thought finally occurred, giving him at least some sense of what he could do for a distraction if nothing else. "In that case, once I'm dressed I'm going to go visit Rei. What room is she in?"
好的，" 真嗣说着站起身，走向浴室门，边走边拿起衣服。当他触碰到门把手时，一个新念头突然闪现，至少给了他一些分散注意力的想法。"那我穿好衣服后就去看看绫波。她在哪个房间？

The doctor cleared his throat. "Uh... room 115, but I'm not sure if she's being allowed visitors yet."
医生清了清嗓子，说道：“呃... 她在 115 号房间，不过还不清楚是否允许访客探视。”

Shinji slowly turned his head to stare at him over his shoulder, causing the man to flinch slightly. "Is she quarantined?"
真嗣缓缓扭头，从肩头上方盯着他，使得那人不禁微微一颤。"她是否被隔离了？"

"Well, no, but-" 嗯，不是的，但是-

"Have you been given explicit orders to not allow anyone to see her?"
你是否有明确指令，禁止任何人见她？

"No but-" 不过，-

"Then I am going to go and visit her."
接下来，我打算去看看她。

The doctor looked at him for a moment, but couldn't maintain eye contact. He turned his head away and mumbled, "Fair enough..."
医生瞥了他一眼，却没能继续对视。他扭过头，低声道：“行吧……”

With that, Shinji entered the bathroom.
于是，真嗣走进了浴室。

"Sheesh, if I didn't know any better I'd have sworn I was talking to the Second Child, not the Third."
哎呀，要是不清楚情况，我真会以为自己在跟老二说话，而不是老三呢。

Shinji spun around, but the doctor had already left the room. He blinked in puzzlement for a few seconds, and then went over the conversation in his head. He had been rather more forceful than he otherwise would have been. Then again Asuka would have likely added a few curse words to the mix.
真嗣转身时，医生已悄然离去。他愣了几秒，眼中满是困惑，随后在心中重温了那段对话。他意识到自己刚才的语气比往常要严厉。换做是明日香，恐怕还会夹杂几句咒骂。

'Wait, I've been accidentally speaking German and acting more like Asuka according to two people,' he thought with a frown as he got changed. 'I'm pretty sure I'm still myself. I don't seem to have any memories of Germany or anything else from her life, so we haven't merged... probably. This is going to be a real long shot, but... Asuka? Are you in here somewhere?' He waited for a minute, adjusting his shirt, but nothing happened. 'Guess that was too much to ask for...'
'等等，我意外地开始说德语，并且行为举止更像明日香，据两个人所说，' 他皱着眉头想着，同时换衣服。'我很确定我还是我自己。我似乎没有任何关于德国或她生活中的其他记忆，所以我们应该没有融合...大概。这确实是个大胆的猜测，但是...明日香？你在这里面吗？' 他等了一分钟，调整着衬衫，但什么也没发生。'看来这要求太多了...'

He left his room and headed for room 115, that irritating thought still pounding away with each footstep.
他走出自己的房间，径直前往 115 号房间，那个烦人的念头随着他的每一步都愈发强烈。

'Asuka's gone. Might never see her again.'
'明日香已经离开，或许再也见不到她了。'

Shinji hissed in frustration and smacked his forehead with the palm of his hand. All he could do was hope talking to Rei would help distract him for a while.
真嗣懊恼地倒吸一口气，用手掌重重拍了拍自己的额头。他唯有希望与绫波的对话能暂时让他分心。

He knocked on the door to room 115, entering when he heard a soft voice murmur, "Come in."
他敲响了 115 号房间的门，听到里面传来一声轻柔的“请进”，随即推门而入。

"Hi Rei," said Shinji as the door closed behind him.
"你好，丽，" 真嗣说道，同时门在他身后关闭了。

Rei was sitting up in bed, looking out the window, but his voice caused her head to quickly turn around. She graced him with a rare small smile, but then she hastily looked away from him. "Hello Shinji. I am glad to see you are well."
丽坐在床上，凝视着窗外，但他的声音让她迅速回过头。她罕见地对他微微一笑，随即又急忙将目光移开。"真嗣，你好。看到你没事，我很欣慰。"

"Well, mostly," Shinji replied, walking over to stand by the bed. "I woke up and didn't realise I was speaking German until Misato outright told me."
嗯，基本上是这样，" 真嗣说着，走到床边站定。"我醒来时还没察觉自己在说德语，直到美里明确告诉我。

"...I see," said Rei. "I have already been informed as to what occurred with Asuka. All I can do is hope she is returned to us soon."
...我明白了," 雷伊说道。"关于明日香的情况，我已知晓。现在唯有期盼她早日归来。

"Yeah, me too..." Shinji's gaze wandered around the room, before settling on Rei's arm. "So... your arms are still paralysed, aren't they?"
嗯，我也一样..." 真嗣环顾四周，目光最终停留在绫波的手臂上。"这么说...你的手臂还是动弹不得，对吗？

Rei focused her gaze on her right arm for a few seconds, then sighed quietly. "Yes, there has been no change yet. I have been reassured that it will soon pass, but since I am essentially helpless I remain confined to this bed."
瑞将目光聚焦在右臂上，凝视了几秒，随后轻叹一声。“确实，目前还未见变化。我得到保证，这很快就会好转，但鉴于我目前无能为力，只能继续卧床。”

"Damnit," Shinji muttered. "I wish we could have stopped the other Angel quicker so we could have helped you."
真该死，" 真嗣喃喃自语。"真希望我们能早点解决掉另一个使徒，那样就能来帮你了。

Rei remained silent, still not looking at him. Shinji raised an eyebrow in puzzlement. Normally she would maintain eye contact with whoever she was speaking to. "...Rei? Is something wrong?" Her head twitched ever so slightly, but it may as well have been an Angel alarm for how clear it was to him. "Please talk to me, Rei."
绫波沉默不语，目光依旧避开他。真嗣不解地挑起眉毛，通常她与人交谈时总会保持眼神交流。“...绫波？是不是有什么事？”她的头微微一颤，对他而言，这无异于天使来袭的警报。“绫波，请跟我说说话。”

More silence was his answer but Shinji remained undeterred, holding his gaze on her. Finally, what felt like an hour later, Rei turned her head so that she could just barely see him. "During the fight, I did something I am ashamed of in order to defeat the Angel."
他的回答依旧是更多的沉默，但真嗣并未因此动摇，目光依旧坚定地注视着她。终于，在仿佛过了一个小时之后，绫波微微侧过头，勉强能瞥见他。“战斗时，我为了打败使徒，做了件让我感到羞愧的事。”

A retort popped into Shinji's mind but he kept his mouth shut, quickly recognising it as something Asuka would have said. Instead he sat quietly and let Rei continue.
真嗣脑海中闪过一个反驳，但他忍住没说，立刻意识到这番话像是明日香的作风。他选择沉默地坐着，让零继续发言。

"During the fight I was briefly able to get the Angel down on the ground and rescue Kensuke's entry plug, even though Commander Ikari ordered me to ignore it." she continued. "But I was unable to disengage to take him to safety, and with one hand occupied I could not adequately defend myself against the Angel, let alone kill it. Commander Ikari demanded that I abandon the entry plug, but the Angel seemed intent on taking it back, to the point where it was almost ignoring my Eva."
战斗中，我曾短暂地将使徒制服在地，成功救出了健介的插入栓，尽管伊吹指挥官命令我别管。然而，我无法抽身将其送往安全处，一手被占用，难以有效防御使徒，更遑论消灭它。伊吹指挥官命令我放弃插入栓，但使徒似乎铁了心要夺回它，几乎对我的 EVA 视而不见。

Shinji inhaled sharply, feeling a wave of anger wash over him. His father was willing to let Kensuke die? Then he remembered what Misato had told him, that the Angel had somehow managed to bite the entry plug, and a chill replaced the heat of anger.
真嗣深吸一口气，怒火中烧。他的父亲竟能眼睁睁看着健介送命？他记起美里的话，那使徒不知如何竟咬住了插入栓，怒火瞬间被寒意取代。

"I... ended up using that to my advantage." Rei's voice was quieter now, more... nervous? "I threw the plug up in the air and attacked the Angel's core while it was distracted. But... even though I managed to break the core, the Angel still managed to catch the plug in its mouth and..." She squeezed her eyes shut.
"我...最终巧妙地利用了这一点。" 绫的声音变得低沉，透出一丝紧张，"我趁机将插头抛向空中，并在使徒分神之际猛攻其核心。然而...即便我成功击碎了核心，使徒竟还是用嘴接住了插头，并且..." 她紧闭双眼，神情凝重。

"...I know the rest," Shinji dully said. "Misato told me earlier."
...剩下的我都知道了，" 真嗣无精打采地说。"美里之前已经告诉我了。

Rei glanced at him. "I see," she replied, her gaze drifting away once more. "I am... sorry, Shinji. I was unable to keep my promise."
绫看了他一眼，"我明白了，"她轻声回应，目光随即又飘向了远方。"真嗣，对不起，我没能守住我的承诺。"

"Promise?" 真的会做到吗？

"I said that I would keep Kensuke safe. I failed."
我曾承诺会保护健介的安全，但我没能做到。

Shinji ran a hand down his face as he marshalled his thoughts. "Asuka's not here, but at this point I reckon I have a good idea what she'd say if she was with us." He cleared his throat. The words came surprisingly easy. "You've got nothing to apologise for, Wondergirl! The Angels are bastards and they don't fight fair! All we can do is fight harder and smarter than them. You kept that Angel off our back so that we could take down the biggest threat. Kensuke's still alive and that's what matters. As far as I'm concerned you did keep that promise!"
真嗣用手抹了把脸，整理思绪。"明日香虽然不在，但我想我知道她若在场会说什么。"他清了清嗓子，话出乎意料地流畅。"奇迹女孩，你无需道歉！使徒本就卑鄙，不讲武德！我们唯有更加努力、更加机智地与之抗衡。你牵制住了那个使徒，使我们得以应对最大的威胁。健介安然无恙，这才是最重要的。在我看来，你确实履行了承诺！"

Silence reigned in the room for an awkward moment, before a small smile blossomed on Rei's face. "Ignoring the obvious differences, your impression of her was uncanny. Thank you, Shinji."
房间内一度弥漫着尴尬的静默，直到绫的嘴角浮现出一抹微笑。“尽管有些明显的不同，你对她的模仿真是太像了。谢谢你，真嗣。”

Shinji's face flushed. "Erm... you're welcome," he stammered.
真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕。"呃...不用谢,"他有些口吃地回应。

Another awkward moment would have ensued, had it not been for a nurse entering the room pushing a small trolley. On it was a glass of water with a straw and a bowl of chunky soup.
若非一位护士推着小车进来，尴尬场面恐怕又要上演。车上摆着一杯带吸管的水和一碗浓汤。

"Hello Ms Ayanami- oh, and Mister Ikari too," the nurse greeted, giving Shinji a nod. "Good to see you up and about once more." To Rei, she said, "Would you like to have something to eat now?"
你好，绫波小姐，还有碇先生，"护士微笑着向真嗣点头致意。"很高兴看到你恢复活力了。" 她转向绫波问道，"现在想吃点东西吗？

"Yes please," Rei replied.
"好的，请吧，" 雷回答道。

"Uh, hey..." interrupted Shinji as the nurse went to pick up the bowl. "Would it be alright if I helped her eat instead?"
呃，嘿..." 新二打断了正要去拿碗的护士，问道："我帮她吃，可以吗？

The nurse stared blankly at him for a moment, then her eyes flicked over to Rei and back again. "I... see no problem with that," she slowly said. "Ms Ayanami, is that alright with you?"
护士愣愣地看了他一会儿，目光随即转向绫波丽又转回来。“我……觉得没问题，”她慢慢地说道。“绫波小姐，您觉得呢？”

"...That would be appreciated," said Rei, shooting Shinji a puzzled look.
"...那样会很感激的," 雷伊说着, 向真嗣投去一个困惑的眼神。

The nurse sat the bowl back down on the trolley and bowed. "Then I'll leave you two to it," she said before exiting the room.
护士把碗放回推车上，鞠躬道：“那我就不打扰了，”说完便走出了房间。

Shinji shifted a chair and the trolley next to the bed and sat down. Just as he was about to dip the spoon into the soup, Rei spoke up.
真嗣把椅子和手推车移到床旁，坐下后正要舀汤，绫波突然说话了。

"Why did you ask to do this?"
你为什么要求做这件事？

"Well," Shinji began, trying not to think that thought that had driven him here in the first place. "I came here because I needed a distraction... oh, and to visit you of course," he hurriedly added. "With everything that's going on, I'm feeling kinda... useless. If I can at least do something like this for you..."
嗯，" 真嗣开口，努力不去想那个最初促使他来此的念头。"我来这儿是想找点事分散注意力...当然，也是来看你的，" 他赶紧加上这句。"眼下发生的一切让我觉得自己挺...没用的。如果我至少能为你做点什么...

Rei stared at him as he trailed off, then gave a slight nod of her head. "I see." A corner of her mouth tilted slightly upwards. "It may be a good thing that Asuka isn't here right now."
丽凝视着他，见他话音渐止，便轻轻点头。“我懂了。”她嘴角露出一丝微笑。“或许明日香此刻不在，反倒是件好事。”

Shinji froze with the full spoon halfway from the bowl to her mouth. "...Pardon?"
真嗣举着满满一勺食物，停在从碗到嘴的半途中，愣住了。"...你说什么？"

"You are attempting to court her, are you not? I believe she would feel some amount of jealousy if she were to witness this."
你是在追求她吧？我猜她要是看到这一幕，心里多少会有些醋意。

His face flushing, Shinji looked away and huffed. "J-just let me help you," he mumbled.
他的脸颊泛红，真嗣别过头，轻叹一声。“就让我来帮你吧，”他低声嘟囔道。

"Very well. I shall not tell her if you do not."
那好吧，你不说的话，我也不会告诉她。

"It never leaves this room."
它从未走出过这个房间。

"Too late. The nurse knows."
已经太迟了，护士已经知情。

A moment later, a very Asuka-like curse filled the room.
不久，房间里响起了一阵酷似明日香的咒骂声。

XXX

After helping Rei with her meal, Shinji chatted with her for a little longer until something came up that he couldn't assist her with.
帮助绫波丽用完餐后，真嗣又和她闲聊了一阵，直到碰上一个他帮不上忙的难题。

"Could you... please press the nurse call button?" she asked.
"您能帮忙按一下护士呼叫按钮吗？"她问道。

"What? Is there a problem, Rei?" replied Shinji.
"怎么了？绫波，有什么问题吗？" 真嗣回应道。

Rei shook her head. "Not as such. It is simply something you would be very uncomfortable with."
瑞摇摇头说：“倒也不是那样。只是这事会让你感到极为不适。”

Shinji frowned, running over possibilities in his mind, until Rei pointedly glanced at the door leading to the bathroom. His gaze flicked over to the door for a second, and then his face went red.
碇真嗣眉头紧锁，心中反复揣摩各种可能，直到绫波丽刻意地朝浴室门瞥了一眼。他目光一瞬间转向那扇门，脸上随即泛起红晕。

"Oh!" he suddenly exclaimed as he fumbled for the call button. "R-right!"
哦！"他突然惊呼，手忙脚乱地摸索着呼叫按钮。"对，对！

Moments later, the same nurse from before arrived. Rei nodded towards the bathroom and the nurse immediately went to her side, helping her out of the bed.
不久，之前的那位护士又来了。Rei 示意了一下浴室，护士随即上前，协助她从床上起身。

"I'll... just head off for now," Shinji awkwardly said, trying desperately not to think about the kind of aid someone in Rei's situation would need. "I think I've taken up enough of your time."
我...现在就先告辞了，" 真嗣尴尬地说，努力不去想零这种情况需要何种援助。"我已经占用你不少时间了。

"You are going to the Eva cage, correct?" replied Rei.
"你是要去 Eva 的笼子，对吗？" 丽回应说。

Shinji blinked. She'd gotten it exactly right. "...Yeah."
真嗣眨了眨眼，她确实说中了。"...对。"

"Then... give her my best wishes."
那么... 请代我向她表达最美好的祝愿。

He didn't need to ask who she meant. Instead, he simply nodded and said, "Will do. See you later."
他没问她指的是谁，只是点头应道：“知道了。回头见。”

Turning to the door out to the corridor, Shinji went to press the button, but the door opened before his hand could reach it. Puzzled, he looked at the doorway and instantly paled upon seeing a familiar dark suit.
真嗣转向通往走廊的门，正要伸手按下按钮，门却提前开了。他一脸困惑地望向门口，一见到那熟悉的黑色西装，脸色瞬间变得苍白。

"Shinji." 真嗣。

"Um... h-hello Father," Shinji eloquently replied.
"呃... 您-您好，神父，" 真嗣有些结巴地回答。

Indeed, it was Commander Ikari standing there, his gaze focused at some point behind Shinji with his hands clasped behind his back. Shinji stepped aside to let his father into the room, but the man remained where he was.
确实，碇司令就站在那里，目光凝视着真嗣身后的某一点，双手背在身后。真嗣侧身让路，希望父亲进屋，然而他并未移动。

"You came to visit Rei," said his father.
"你来看望 Rei 了，" 他的父亲说。

"Y-yes. I also... um... helped her eat some soup."
是的，我还帮她喝了点汤。

"And now you are going to the Eva cage."
现在你将前往伊娃的笼子。

Again, somebody had worked out exactly what Shinji was going to do. He knew that if he asked how his father knew there would be no response.
又一次，有人精准地预判了真嗣的行动。他明白，若询问父亲是如何得知的，只会徒劳无功。

"Yes," he lamely replied then, sensing it might not be enough, meekly added, "...please?"
是的，"他当时含糊地回答，觉得可能不够，便怯生生地追问了一句，"...可以吗？

Finally, the man's gaze drifted down to meet his. Shinji tried gamely to maintain what little eye contact was possible with someone who wore nearly-opaque glasses. Perhaps he wore them to prevent people reading him like he could read them.
最后，那人的视线缓缓垂下，与他的目光交汇。真嗣尽力维持着与这位戴着近乎不透明眼镜的人之间有限的目光交流。也许他戴这种眼镜，是为了防止别人像他洞察他人一样轻易看透自己。

"You have already been given free reign to come and go from the cages as you please," said his father. "However, if you interfere with the operation taking place that permission will be rescinded."
你已享有自由进出笼子的权利，"父亲说道，"但若你干预正在进行的事务，这份自由将被收回。

Shinji's eyes widened. He'd been expecting to have to either beg or bluff his way in, but now he was being freely allowed in? "U-understood, sir. T-thank you."
真嗣瞪大了眼睛。他原以为得要么恳求要么装腔作势才能进去，没想到现在却被允许自由进入？“明、明白了，先生。谢、谢谢您。”

The elder Ikari's gaze shifted back up as he moved into the room, and Shinji took that to mean that another deep, meaningful father-son conversation had come to an end. He sidled through the open doorway, staring at his father's back until the closing door cut off his view.
老碇走进房间时目光重新抬起，真嗣意识到又一次深具意义的父子对话已经结束。他侧身穿过敞开的门，目送父亲的背影，直到关门声阻断了他的视线。

Out in the hallway, Shinji exhaled and ran a hand through his hair. Already, with nothing to distract him, he could feel that thought coming back. He took a deep breath, held it in for a few seconds, then released it at the same time he began walking. The few people sharing the corridors with him quickly shifted out of his way as he approached, perhaps seeing the determination etched on his face. That thought began to twist in his head, warping into something new but no less intrusive.
走廊上，真嗣深吸一口气，用手梳理了一下头发。此刻，没有任何事物能让他分心，那个念头再次袭来。他深吸一口气，屏息几秒，随后一边呼气一边迈步前行。走廊上的其他人见他走来，纷纷让道，或许是被他脸上的坚定神情所感染。那个念头在他心中扭曲变形，虽是新形态，却依旧挥之不去。

'Need to see her.' '得见她一面。'

The elevator was now directly ahead, doors opened and empty as if it were waiting just for him. Shinji stepped inside and pressed both the button for the Evangelion cage floor, and the door close button. The car trundled upwards, fortunately not stopping anywhere but at the floor he wanted. The moment the doors opened Shinji took off at a run, charging down the corridors and slowing only for corners. Only when he reached the familiar security door did he come to a halt, breathing rapidly after the run but refusing to take a moment to recover. He slapped the door switch, waited impatiently for the system to unlock the door, and began to run again as soon as his path was clear.
电梯正对着他，门敞开着，空荡荡的，仿佛特意在等他。真嗣步入电梯，同时按下了前往 EVA 机库的楼层按钮和关门键。电梯平稳上升，幸运的是，它并未在其他楼层停留，直奔目的地。门一开，真嗣便疾步如飞，沿着走廊冲刺，仅在拐角处略微减速。直到抵达那扇熟悉的安检门，他才停下，急促地呼吸着，却无暇休息。他猛拍开门按钮，焦急等待系统解锁，一旦门开，便立刻继续他的奔跑。

The first two cages and their occupants, human and Evangelion, were ignored completely, but Shinji was forced to slow down upon reaching the third cage. It was that or trip over the myriad devices strewn about the gantry. Several people looked up curiously as he approached, but almost all of them went back to what they were doing. Only one kept their focus on Shinji, even going so far as to approach him.
最初两个笼子里的驾驶员和 EVA 完全无人理睬，然而真嗣在接近第三个笼子时不得不减速，否则就会绊倒在走道上散落的各种设备上。几人好奇地抬头望向他，但几乎所有人又都回到了自己的工作中。唯有一人始终注视着真嗣，甚至主动向他靠近。

"Hello, Shinji," said Doctor Akagi as she stopped in front of him. "I was honestly expecting you here sooner."
你好，真嗣，"阿基拉博士停在他面前说，"说实话，我没想到你这么晚才来。

Shinji stared at her for a moment before sighing. "Is it written on my forehead or something?" he groaned.
真嗣凝视了她片刻，随后叹息一声。“难道我脸上写着吗？”他嘟囔着。

"No, Section Two has been keeping us up to date."
不，第二部分一直在给我们提供最新信息。

"...What," Shinji blankly replied.
"...什么？" 真嗣茫然地应道。

She quirked an eyebrow. "Oh, you were unaware? Those walking slabs of meat in black suits are just part of the protection we have for you pilots. There are at least a dozen people you don't see keeping an eye on you as well as what's happening nearby. They have to report every little thing that occurs so that NERV is kept in the loop regarding your comings and goings. About the only place they stay out of is your home, and even then there's going to be someone in the next building watching your apartment."
她挑眉道："哦，你没察觉吗？那些穿黑西装的壮汉不过是你们飞行员保护措施的一环。暗中至少还有十来个人在密切关注你和周边动态。他们得汇报所有琐碎事件，确保 NERV 掌握你们的动向。唯一不被打扰的只有你的家，即便如此，隔壁楼里也会有人盯梢你的公寓。"

Shinji paled at the revelation that he had far less privacy than he'd thought. "But... how does all that tell you that I'd be coming here?"
得知自己的隐私远不如预期，真嗣脸色一白。"可是...你怎么能从这些信息推断出我会来这里？"

Doctor Akagi just tilted her head to one side, giving him a look of mild exasperation.
阿卡吉医生微微侧头，脸上露出了一丝无奈的神情。

"...Have I really been that obvious?" Shinji mumbled after a few awkwardly silent seconds.
"我真的表现得那么明显吗？" 真嗣在几秒尴尬的沉默后，低声自语。

"Well there's that, and the fact that Unit-02's black box did record your almost-final moments, which us higher-ups had to listen to."
确实如此，而且二号机的黑匣子记录了你临终前的时刻，我们这些高层不得不听了这段录音。

All the blood suddenly drained from Shinji's face. "W-wait! My father knows about that?!" He paused as he realised something. "And... he doesn't care?"
真嗣的脸色骤然苍白。"等、等一下！我父亲知道那件事吗？！"他顿了顿，恍然大悟。"难道...他根本不在乎？"

Doctor Akagi shrugged. "As long as you continue to be an effective pilot, you can do whatever else you like as far as we're concerned. The moment something begins to interfere with your ability to do what we require of you, that's when we'll be forced to step in."
医生阿卡吉耸肩道：“只要你保持高效飞行，其他私事我们不过问。但若影响执行任务，我们便不得不干预了。”

"Huh." Shinji glanced up at the mangled Unit-02. "Well... I'm still just a co-pilot, since all I really do is give Asuka a helping hand. Speaking of her though... what are you actually doing here? I mean, besides repairs, obviously."
嗯。" 真嗣抬头看向受损的二号机。"其实...我还是副驾驶，主要就是帮明日香一把。说到她...你来这儿到底有什么事？当然，修理除外。

Doctor Akagi glanced up at Unit-02, gesturing with a hand. "At the moment, we're setting things up so we can begin attempts to recover Asuka from the core." She shot him a regretful look. "But I'm guessing Misato's already told you that we're not exactly optimistic about our chances."
医生阿卡吉抬头望向二号机，用手势示意。“我们正在做准备，即将尝试从核心中救出明日香。”她带着遗憾的神情看了他一眼。“不过，我想美里已经跟你提过，我们对成功并不抱太大希望。”

"But you are going to do everything you can, right?" Shinji asked. "You can't just leave her in there!"
但你一定会竭尽全力去救她，对吧？" 真嗣焦急地问道。"你不能就这样弃她于不顾！

"Of course we'll do our best," Doctor Akagi said in a placating tone. "But if we reach the deadline with no results-"
当然，我们会全力以赴，" 阿基医生安抚地说。"但如果到了截止日期仍无进展-

"No!" Shinji shouted, ignoring the looks of nearby workers. "She doesn't deserve to be trapped in there forever just because of some suit-wearing bastards hiding away while we keep their asses safe!"
不！" 真嗣大声喊道，对周围工人的目光视而不见。"她不该因为那些穿西装的混蛋躲在幕后，而我们却在保护他们，就永远被困在那里面！

Doctor Akagi stared at him in shock. Shinji blinked, suddenly cognisant of the commotion he'd caused, and looked away bashfully. "Sorry..."
阿卡吉医生震惊地凝视着他。真嗣眨眼间意识到自己造成的混乱，羞涩地别开了目光。“抱歉……”

"I understand, Shinji," Doctor Akagi said with a sigh. "But their word is law. If the Committee tells you to jump, you don't waste breath asking 'how high?'. You just jump until they tell you to stop. We'll do our best, but this is something of a unique situation. Our chances of success are rather low, to be honest."
我理解你的心情，真嗣，" 赤木博士叹息道，"但委员会的指令就是铁律。他们若让你跳，你无需多问'要跳多高'，只需一直跳到他们喊停。我们虽会全力以赴，但坦白讲，成功的希望颇为渺茫。

Despite already expecting that, Shinji felt his heart sink further. "Yeah... I suppose this is the first time a pilot's been absorbed by their Eva."
虽然早有心理准备，真嗣的心依旧沉了下去。“嗯...这恐怕是头一回，驾驶员被自己的 Eva 吞噬。”

Doctor Akagi was silent for a few seconds. "Yes," she finally replied. "Nothing like this has happened before. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to work."
阿卡吉医生沉默了片刻。“确实如此，”她终于开口，“这种事前所未有。如果你们允许，我得回去工作了。”

Shinji nodded and stepped aside to let her pass, following her with his gaze for a brief moment before returning his attention to Unit-02. The core was still exposed, likely so that the workers could do... whatever they were trying. The left arm was completely bare, as was the head and several other areas where damaged plating had yet to be replaced.
碇真嗣点头示意，侧身让路，目光跟随她片刻后，才重新聚焦于二号机。核心依旧外露，想必是为了方便工作人员进行他们的尝试。左臂、头部以及几处受损装甲未更换的部位都裸露无遗。

This was the first time Shinji had seen an Evangelion's head without its helmet, and the uncanny resemblance to a human face was disturbing. Despite being shut down, there still seemed to be a hint of life in its eyes, as if at any moment they would focus on him.
这是真嗣首次目睹无头盔的 EVA 头部，其与人类面孔的惊人相似令人心悸。即便已停止运作，那双眼中仿佛仍潜藏着一丝生机，似乎随时都可能将目光投向他。

Shinji blinked. Wait... were they looking at him? He blinked again, and the sensation of being watched disappeared. He stared into an eye bigger than his head, waiting to see if it happened again, but gave up after a minute.
真嗣眨了眨眼，心想：他们在看我吗？他再次眨眼，那种被注视的感觉随即消失。他凝视着那只比自己头还大的眼睛，期待着是否会有再次被注视的感觉，但一分钟后便放弃了。

Clearly, the situation was starting to get to him.
很明显，他开始受到这种局面的影响。

Shinji spent an unknown amount of time there on the gantry, maintaining a quiet vigil and only moving when somebody needed to get past him. Eventually, when his eyes were starting to droop, he felt a hand on his shoulder.
真嗣在栈桥上默默守候了许久，仅在有人经过时才稍作挪动。直到眼皮渐沉，他才感到一只手轻轻搭在了肩上。

"Come on, Shinji," said Doctor Akagi. "You're nearly dead on your feet. You should go get some sleep in the bunkroom. Can't let you go home unfortunately, what with you being the only pilot."
真嗣，来吧，" 阿卡吉博士劝道，"你都快站不住了。去休息室睡会儿吧。很抱歉，你不能回家，因为你是唯一的驾驶员。

Shinji leaned on the railing and sighed. "Someone needs to keep an eye out for her."
真嗣靠在栏杆上，深深叹了口气。"得有人看着她才行。"

"In the Eva cages, and here in particular now, there's someone watching twenty-four seven," replied Doctor Akagi. "If something were to happen, we'd know in seconds."
在 Eva 的笼子中，尤其是此刻，有人全天候二十四小时监控着，"阿卡吉博士回应道。"一旦有情况发生，我们立刻就能知晓。

Not knowing what else to say, Shinji simply stared at the exposed core of Unit-02. Numerous cables were plugged into it, trailing away to various machines scattered about the gantry. The cage was now empty except for him, Doctor Akagi and two other workers, who seemed about ready to leave themselves.
真嗣不知该说什么，只是默默地注视着暴露的二号机核心。无数电缆接入其中，延伸至周围高架上的各类设备。此刻，笼内仅剩他、赤木博士及另外两名工人，他们也似乎即将离去。

"You'll be no good to her if you're sleep-deprived," Doctor Akagi continued. "And again, you're our only pilot right now. We need you ready to go at a moment's notice, and the Angels won't wait for you to take a power nap."
赤木医生接着说：'你若睡眠不足，对她也无益。况且，目前你是我们唯一的飞行员。我们必须确保你随时能出动，使徒可不会等你小憩片刻。'

Shinji rubbed a hand over his face, then let his arms flop to his sides. He gave a conceding nod and mumbled, "Alright, I suppose..."
真嗣用手抹了把脸，随后双臂无力地垂下。他点头表示妥协，喃喃自语：“行吧，看来只能这样了……”

"I assume you'll be here first thing in the morning?" Before he could respond, Doctor Akagi chuckled. "Oh, what am I saying... of course you'll be here."
我猜你一大早就会到吧？" 他还没来得及回应，赤木医生便轻笑道："哎，我这是怎么了...你肯定会来的。

His only response being a deadpan stare, Shinji trudged off to the cage exit.
真嗣面无表情，只是默默地走向笼子的出口。

The moment the door closed after him, Doctor Akagi looked up at Unit-02 and sighed. "I really hope he stops turning into his father before it's too late."
门一关上，赤木博士便抬头看向二号机，深深叹了口气。"真希望他别再像他父亲那样，免得为时已晚。"

### Chapter 36 I'm Staying Here For Asuka

DAY 1

Lethargic as he was feeling after a night of insufficient sleep, Shinji still rose with the dawn. Or rather, with the alarm on his phone, laying on the bed next to his head, that he set to wake him up at the usual time since the bunkroom didn't have the luxury of a window looking out onto the Geofront. He sat on the edge of the bed, rotating an aching shoulder in circles, and glanced about the room. Several other beds were occupied, hardly surprising after recent events, and one bed even...
尽管因睡眠不足而感到疲惫不堪，真嗣还是在黎明时分起床了。实际上，他是被放在枕边手机上的闹钟唤醒的，因为宿舍没有窗户可以欣赏到 Geofront 的景色。他坐在床沿，活动着酸痛的肩膀，环顾房间。近期事件频发，房间里其他几张床都有人，这并不意外，甚至有一张床还...

Shinji hurriedly averted his eyes. Obviously in a place with as many employees as NERV, there would be at least a few people in romantic relationships. It was no business of his if they decided to fall asleep in the same bed after a gruelling work day. But that logic couldn't stop him feeling a strange sensation in his heart as he passed by the snoozing couple and exited the bunkroom.
真嗣匆忙地移开目光。显然，在像 NERV 这样员工众多的地方，至少会有几对情侣。如果他们在劳累的工作日后选择同床共枕，那与他无关。但这种逻辑无法阻止他在经过熟睡的情侣身边并离开宿舍时，心中涌起一种奇异的感觉。

After a quick stop at the pilot changing room to shower, Shinji put on yesterday's clothes and made a note to ask Misato about getting some things from his wardrobe. He then went to the mess hall and picked something at random for breakfast; after all, unless it was prepared dangerously wrong he wouldn't notice anything anyway.
在飞行员更衣室匆匆洗了个澡，真嗣换上昨天的衣服，心里记着要跟美里说一声，从家里拿些换洗衣物。接着他走进食堂，随便选了份早餐；反正，只要不是做得太离谱，他也吃不出什么差别。

He soon found himself back at the door to the Evangelion cages, barely even remembering the trek. At a more sedate pace than yesterday, he headed to Unit-02's cage; empty apart from him and the red behemoth. Leaning on the railing in front of the Evangelion's head, Shinji bowed his head and sighed, staring aimlessly down into the LCL it was sitting in like the world's largest bathtub.
不久，他发现自己再次站在通往福音战士笼子的门前，几乎记不清是如何走来的。他比昨天更为从容地走向二号机的笼子，那里只有他和那红色的巨兽。真嗣倚靠在福音战士头部前方的栏杆上，低下头叹了口气，茫然地凝视着它所浸泡的 LCL，仿佛那是世界上最大的浴缸。

"Good morning, Asuka," he said after a while. "I'm sure if you could respond, you'd do your usual half-awake grunt while reaching for the coffee machine. Heh. Come to think of it you're a lot like Misato, except she drinks beer to wake up for whatever reason. I'm sure the only thing stopping you from imitating her can slam is the fact that you'd break the mugs."
早上好，明日香，" 他过了一会儿说道。"我猜你要是能回答，肯定还是那副半梦半醒的样子，一边嘟囔着一边去摸咖啡机。呵，这么一想，你和美里还真像，不过她是为了提神而喝啤酒，挺特别的。我估计你没学她一口气喝干，只是怕把杯子给捏碎了。

Shinji glanced around the cage at the massed equipment, none of which he knew the purpose of. "They're going to do what they can to rescue you. I really wish I could help, but I don't have your intellect. I have to stay at NERV, being the only pilot and all, but I don't know if I'd be able to go home even if they'd let me. Until you're back with us, it feels like I have to be here. Couldn't get much sleep last night because I kept thinking about you.
真嗣环视着笼子周围堆积如山的设备，对其用途一无所知。“他们会竭尽全力来救你。我多么希望能帮上忙，可惜我没有你的智慧。我得留在 NERV，毕竟我是唯一的驾驶员，但即便他们允许，我也不确定自己是否能回家。你不在，我就感觉自己必须守在这里。昨晚因为一直想着你，几乎没合眼。”

"I wonder what it's like in there. Are you just unconscious, are you dreaming, or are you actually looking at me right now?" At that last thought, Shinji blushed slightly and looked away from Unit-02's face. "Guess it's a good thing I already confessed. Not like I can do much to embarrass myself any further."
我很好奇里面究竟是怎样的。你是失去了意识，还是在做梦，亦或是此刻真的在注视着我？"想到这里，真嗣脸上泛起一丝红晕，转头不再直视二号机的面庞。"幸好我已经表白了。反正也没什么能让我更尴尬的了。

Engrossed as he was in his one-sided conversation, Shinji didn't hear the cage door open. Doctor Akagi took one step in, paused upon seeing him, and sighed.
真嗣沉浸在自己的独白中，竟未察觉笼门已被打开。赤木医生踏入一步，见状稍作停顿，随即发出一声叹息。

'This is getting out of hand,'she darkly mused. 'Now there's two of them.'
'她暗自思忖，情况愈发失控了。“现在竟然有两个。”'

XXX

DAY 6

It didn't take long for a pattern to emerge. Shinji would wake up, shower, eat breakfast, and be the first one in Unit-02's cage. At the end of the day, he would be one of the last to leave, generally when somebody reminded him. The insistent thought had thankfully died down a bit, so Shinji no longer felt like he was being magnetically pulled towards the cage. This allowed him to begin asking Doctor Akagi for any minor tasks he could do to assist.
没过多久，真嗣的日常模式就清晰起来：醒来、洗澡、吃早餐，然后第一个进入二号机的机库。傍晚时分，他往往是最后离开的，常常需要别人提醒。所幸，那种强烈的念头已有所减弱，真嗣不再感到自己被无形的力量牵引向机库。这让他得以向赤木博士询问，是否有什么小任务可以帮忙。

So of course he ended up mostly fetching coffee for her. It was entirely possible she was also using this as an excuse to get Shinji to do something besides stare at Unit-02 all day, but it did mean he could feel at least somewhat useful, insignificant as the task might be in the long run.
因此，他大部分时间自然是在为她端咖啡。她很可能也利用这个机会让真嗣除了整天盯着二号机外，能做些其他事情，虽然这项任务长远来看可能微不足道，但至少让他感到自己并非一无是处。

But the days passed, and every retrieval attempt ended in failure.
然而，随着时间流逝，每一次检索尝试均以失败告终。

XXX

DAY 8

Shinji's phone began to ring, jolting him out of his musing. He didn't recognise the number on the screen, but he flipped the phone open anyway and gave a cautious "Hello?"
真嗣的手机铃声响起，打断了他的沉思。屏幕上显示的号码很陌生，但他还是翻开手机，谨慎地应了一声“喂？”

"Hey, Shin-man! It's Toji!" came the energetic greeting from someone Shinji hadn't even thought about in ages, let alone talked to.
"嘿，Shin-man！我是 Toji！" 这声充满活力的问候，来自一个 Shinji 久未想起，更别提交谈的人。

"Ah, um, hello Toji. How are things?"
嗨，Toji，最近怎么样？

"...'How are things?'" Toji echoed in surprise. "Well there's the fact that four people are missing from my class for the past week. Four people that happen to be Eva pilots! Four people that happen to be friends of me n' Class Rep!"
...'最近情况如何？'" 东治惊讶地反问道。"其实，我班上有四个人已经失踪一周了。巧的是，这四个人都是 EVA 的驾驶员！而且他们正好是我和班长的朋友！

Shinji winced as his friend's tone turned harsh. With everything that had happened, he had completely forgotten that Toji and Hikari would have been left completely out of the loop as to what had happened. He sighed into the phone. "Sorry. Things are just... not great, to be honest."
真嗣皱了皱眉，因为朋友的语气突然变得严厉。经历了这么多，他完全忘了东治和光对此一无所知。他对着电话叹了口气，说道：“抱歉，说实话，现在的情况并不乐观。”

"...How bad are we talkin' here?"
...我们这里说的糟糕程度是怎样的？

Glancing up at Unit-02, Shinji replied, "...Well, to put it simply, I'm the only active pilot right now, meaning I have to stay at NERV. The others are... hospitalised." He had to be vague, what with operational security, but it pained him to have to almost lie to Toji.
抬头看向二号机，真嗣回应说：“...简单讲，眼下只有我一个能驾驶，所以我得留在 NERV。其他人都...在医院。”出于操作安全的考虑，他不得不含糊其辞，但这种近乎撒谎的感觉让他心里很不是滋味。

"Shit." Along with Toji's angry curse, Shinji thought he heard a gasp of surprise from someone else. "But, they're gonna be okay, right?"
该死！" 冬二的怒骂声中，真嗣似乎还听到了另一人惊讶的吸气声。"他们应该会没事吧？

Shinji almost gave the answer he wanted to, but the words caught in his throat. At that moment Doctor Akagi walked past, and he covered the phone as he called out to her. "Excuse me, Doctor?"
真嗣差点就说出他心中的答案，可话到嘴边却哽住了。恰在此时，赤木医生路过，他忙捂住话筒，向她喊道：“不好意思，赤木医生？”

"Hmm?" She turned around and raised an eyebrow at him. "What is it, Shinji?"
嗯？" 她转过身，挑眉看向他。"什么事，真嗣？

"I'm talking to a friend from school. What can I tell them about the other pilots?"
我正与一位校友聊天。关于其他飞行员的情况，我应该告诉他们些什么呢？

Doctor Akagi blinked slowly, and then beckoned for the phone. Shinji hesitantly handed it over. "This is Doctor Ritsuko Akagi, head of Project E at NERV. Pilots Ayanami, Soryu and Aida are currently hospitalised. Ayanami is stable and should be discharged in a few days, but it's currently unclear how long Soryu and Aida will take to recover, as their conditions are much more severe. That is everything you are allowed to know. Any questions?" After a moment, she handed the phone back to Shinji and continued on.
赤木医生缓缓眨了眨眼，然后示意要电话。真嗣迟疑地递了过去。“我是 NERV 项目 E 的负责人，赤木律子医生。目前，飞行员绫波、惣流和相田正在住院治疗。绫波情况稳定，预计几天后可以出院，但惣流和相田的康复时间尚不确定，他们的病情较为严重。这是您可以了解的所有信息。还有其他问题吗？”稍作停顿后，她将电话递回给真嗣，继续前行。

"...Well I guess that answers that," Toji mumbled. "How are you holding up though, Shin-man?"
...嗯，看来这已经回答了那个问题，" 东二低声说道。"你还好吧，信？

"I'm... managing," Shinji quietly replied. "We got hit real hard. Two Angels at once, and not like the one where we had to dance. One of them was strong enough to blast a hole from the surface right down to the Geofront in seconds."
我...正在应对，" 真嗣低声回应。"我们遭受了严重打击。同时来了两个使徒，与之前那个需要我们配合的截然不同。其中一个力量惊人，瞬间就能从地表轰穿至 Geofront 深处。

Toji chuckled. "I'm gonna take one guess and say that's the one you 'n Red went after."
透二笑着说：“我猜那肯定是你和雷德追捕的那个。”

Shinji smiled weakly. "Yeah, you got it."
碇真嗣无力地笑了笑，说：“对，你理解了。”

"Well, I still gotta have lunch before the bell rings, so I'll let ya go for now."
嗯，我还得在铃响之前吃午饭，所以现在就先不打扰你了。

"Alright then. Catch you later."
好的，回头见。

"Seeya." 拜拜。

DAY 12 第 12 日

"I'm surprised you're not bored senseless by now."
真没想到，你到现在还没无聊透顶。

Shinji turned away from Unit-02, its head armour fully restored, as Misato stepped up next to him. "Boredom doesn't matter," he replied. "I'm staying here for Asuka."
真嗣背对头部装甲已修复完好的二号机，此时美里走近他身旁。“无聊与否无关紧要，”他回应说，“我留在这儿全是为了明日香。”

Misato mimicked his posture, leaning on the rail in front of the Evangelion. Even now, almost a fortnight after the latest Angel attack, she looked tired in the middle of the day despite the fact Shinji knew she was most likely living off of the coffee in Doctor Akagi's office. And with no Asuka around, their guardian would have reverted to instant, no-real-nutritional-content meals to keep herself going.
三嶋模仿他的姿势，倚在福音战士前的栏杆上。尽管距离最近的使徒袭击已过去近两周，白天她依然显得疲惫，尽管真嗣知道她多半是靠赤木博士办公室的咖啡提神。而且，明日香不在，他们的监护人恐怕又得靠那些即食、缺乏真正营养的餐食来维持体力了。

"So you've spent almost two weeks just standing around here, huh?" she said. "Have you even gone to see Rei at all?"
这么说，你在这儿闲晃了快两周了？"她问道，"你去看过零了吗？

Shinji felt a flash of guilt. In his current obsession, he had completely forgotten about her. "W-well, I did visit her back before I started coming here," he replied, internally wincing at how lame it sounded.
碇真嗣心头掠过一丝愧疚。沉浸于当前的痴迷，他竟将她忘得一干二净。“嗯，我确实在她来这儿之前去看过她，”他回应着，内心却对自己这番话感到无力。

"And then you basically abandoned her to stand around in a cage staring at a robot," Misato retorted. She raised a hand as he opened his mouth to protest. "Yes, I know very well that you want to be here for Asuka at all times, but that's no excuse to ignore everything and everyone around you. I mean, do you even know what's going on with that Kensuke boy?"
然后你基本上就把她丢在一边，让她在笼子里无所事事地盯着机器人，" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷反驳道。她举起一只手，阻止他开口抗议。"我知道你总想时刻陪在惣流·明日香·兰格雷身边，但这不是你忽视周围一切人和事的理由。说起来，你了解那个叫洞木光的孩子最近的情况吗？

"...No..." ...不...

"Of course you don't." Misato's harsh demeanour suddenly broke down as she sheepishly rubbed the back of her head. "Then again, I don't really know either. He's quarantined, has remained unconscious, and nobody's allowed to even be in the same room as him without full HAZMAT gear, even though he's locked in an isolation tank."
你当然不知道。" 碇真嗣的严厉态度突然软化，她尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺。"说实话，我也不太明白。他被隔离了，一直昏迷不醒，而且任何人要进入他的房间都必须穿戴全套防护装备，即便他被关在隔离舱内。

Shinji looked up at her, worry creeping its way onto his face. "Do they know anything new about him?"
真嗣抬头望向她，脸上渐渐显露出忧虑。“关于他，他们有什么新的消息吗？”

"Only that whatever infected the Eva also got to Kensuke. Tried to... assimilate him. That's why he's in quarantine; for all we know the Angel could be hiding out in a human host."
唯一确定的是，感染了 Eva 的未知物同样侵袭了健介，试图将他同化。因此他必须接受隔离；我们无法排除天使可能潜伏在人类宿主中的可能性。

Misato's grim expression was enough for Shinji to understand just how serious she was. He raised a fist and slammed it down on the railing, ignoring the sharp jolt of pain erupting in his hand. Misato caught his arm before he could do it again.
美里那严肃的表情让真嗣立刻意识到事情的严重性。他举起拳头，重重地砸向栏杆，全然不顾手上传来的剧痛。美里迅速抓住他的手臂，阻止他再次捶打。

"This wasn't your fault, Shinji," she stated. "We've been going over everything that happened, trying to learn where the Angel came from, and we're still not entirely sure. Our best guess is the storm the transport plane flew through on its way here. Data analysis showed odd readings when it got struck by lightning, but the crew either didn't notice or didn't think it worth mentioning."
这不是你的错，真嗣。"她坚定地说。"我们反复梳理了整个事件，试图查明使徒的来历，但至今仍未完全明了。我们推测，可能是运输机在飞来途中遭遇的那场风暴所致。数据分析显示，飞机被雷击时出现了异常信号，但机组人员可能未曾察觉，或认为不值一提。

Shinji stared at her as she slowly released his arm and he let it return to his side. "And there was... nothing else until the fight that said there might be something wrong?"
真嗣凝视着她，见她缓缓松开他的胳膊，他便任由胳膊自然垂下。"在战斗之前，真的没有任何迹象暗示可能有问题吗？"

"Nothing at all," Misato confirmed. "This Angel seemed to know exactly how to disguise itself to avoid detection."
碇真嗣确认道：‘什么都没有，这个使徒似乎非常清楚如何伪装自己，从而避免被发现。’

Shinji looked away, hissing in frustration. "And it knew exactly when to strike too. If it wasn't an Angel I'd think there was a spy in NERV."
真嗣别过头，愤愤地嘶声道：“它连攻击时机都把握得恰到好处。若非使徒，我真会怀疑 NERV 里有内鬼。”

Misato sighed and slumped over the railing. "I'd love for that to be the case. I can hunt down a spy; I can't do anything against an Angel besides send you kids out there and tell you what to do."
美里叹了口气，身体倚在栏杆上。“我倒希望如此。追查间谍我还能行；至于使徒，除了派你们这些孩子上阵，告诉你们怎么做，我别无他法。”

"Well, I... uh, I'll keep my eyes open anyway," said Shinji. "You know, just in case."
嗯，我...呃，总之我会留意的，" 真嗣说。"你知道的，以防万一。

Stifling an amused snort, Misato replied, "Shinji, if you actually manage to find an Angel wandering around NERV, I will... uhh..." She trailed off for a second, thinking deeply. "Oh! Got it! I'll pay for your first car when you get your license! How about that?"
忍俊不禁的葛城美里回答说：“真嗣，要是你真能在 NERV 附近撞见使徒，我就……嗯……”她顿了顿，陷入沉思。“啊！有了！你拿到驾照后，我给你买第一辆车！这个提议如何？”

Shinji levelled a bemused look at her. "I can't tell if you're serious or not."
真嗣一脸困惑地看着她，说：“我真搞不懂你是认真的还是在开玩笑。”

"I am totally serious!" Misato exclaimed. "If you find an Angel, I'll buy you a car! Deal?"
我可是认真的！" 碇真嗣强调道。"要是你发现了使徒，我就送你一辆车！怎么样，成交吗？

"It's not much of a deal, but... I guess I'll take it?" Shinji paused, blinking several times. "Wait, are you trying to get me to spend less time in here?"
虽然不是什么大事，但...我想我还是接受吧？" 真嗣顿了顿，眨了眨眼。"等等，你是想让我减少在这里的时间吗？

"Ssssssort of?" Misato replied, waggling a hand in a so-so gesture.
"算是吧？" 米萨托回应着，手摆出一种模棱两可的姿态。

Suppressing a sigh, Shinji pushed off from the railing. "Well, you did remind me that I haven't talked to Rei in a while, and Doctor Akagi's busy with something else at the moment. I guess I may as well take a walk."
真嗣忍住叹息，从栏杆上撑起身来。“嗯，你提醒我了，我确实好久没和绫波聊天了，赤木博士现在也正忙。我想我不如去散个步。”

"Alright, I'll see you later then!"
好的，那待会儿见！

Misato gave him a jaunty wave, which he absently returned before heading back through the Evangelion cages. He stopped at the main door, glancing back in the direction of Misato.
碇真嗣心不在焉地回应了葛城美里轻快的挥手，然后穿过 EVA 机库返回。他在主门前驻足，回头望向葛城美里的方向。

'Yeah, sure,' he thought to himself. 'She knew it would be ridiculous for me to find an Angel hiding out down here. She's just trying to look out for me, in her own weird way.'
'嗯，确实，' 他心中暗想。'她明白我在这儿寻找藏匿的天使有多荒唐。她不过是用自己的奇特方式在关照我。'

Shaking his head, already dismissing the ludicrous idea of winning the bet and Misato buying him a car, he stepped through the door into the corridor.
他摇摇头，心中已将赢得赌注和美里给他买车的荒唐念头抛诸脑后，随即推门步入走廊。

And was almost knocked back through the doorway as somebody barrelled past him. Only a hastily thrown out hand grabbing onto the doorway stopped him from falling on his ass.
差点被人撞得倒退回门口，多亏他迅速伸手抓住门框，才避免了摔个屁股墩。

"Sorry!" the person shouted, not even looking back.
"抱歉！"那人喊了一声，头也不回地走了。

Shinji scowled at their retreating back. It was yet another harried NERV employee, judging by the beige outfit and the stack of papers in their hand. He let out a sigh and headed the other way down the corridor towards the elevator.
真嗣望着他们离去的背影，眉头紧锁。从那身米色制服和手中的一叠文件来看，显然又是一个忙碌的 NERV 员工。他叹了口气，转身沿着走廊向电梯走去。

'Didn't know people dyed their hair white of all things,' he mused as he got onto the elevator.
'他走进电梯时，心中暗想：“真没想到还有人特意把头发染成白色。”'

"Hello, Shinji." 你好，真嗣。

If Rei was disappointed or annoyed with his absence, Shinji couldn't detect a hint of it in her voice. "Hi. Sorry I've been gone so long, I-"
如果绫波丽对真嗣的缺席感到失望或不悦，真嗣却丝毫听不出她声音中的异样。"嗨，真对不起，我离开这么久了，我-"

"I understand," she gently cut him off. "And judging by your expression, there has been no luck yet in rescuing Asuka."
我明白了，"她轻声打断道，"看你的表情，似乎还没能救出明日香。

"None at all," he glumly confirmed. "I'm not even really sure their efforts have done anything. From the sound of it, we're no better off than when we started."
完全没有，"他沮丧地确认。"我甚至怀疑他们的努力是否起了作用。听起来，我们和开始时相比并无改善。

Shinji let out a sigh, ambling over to the chair next to the bed and slumping onto it. "Enough about me, I guess. How have you been doing?"
真嗣叹了口气，缓步走向床边的椅子，颓然坐下。“我的事就聊到这里。你最近如何？”

Rei slowly raised a hand to the height of her head. Shinji could see that there was some minor shakiness to it that he knew had never been there before. "I have regained almost full use of my arms now, although they are still rather numb. I am to remain here until the doctors can confirm I am back to a hundred percent."
绫波缓缓将手举至头顶，真嗣注意到她的手有些微颤，这在以前是从未有过的。“我的手臂功能已基本恢复，只是还有些麻木感。我得留在这里，直到医生确认我已百分百康复。”

"Considering it's just the two of us, you likely still won't be going home when that happens," Shinji mused. He froze as a thought occurred. "Damn, if an Angel had attacked this past fortnight, would you have been sent out? I still remember what happened on my first day here..."
想想只有我们俩，即便如此，你多半还是不会回去。" 真嗣沉思道。他突然一怔，脑海中闪过一个念头。"糟糕，要是两周前使徒来袭，你会被派出去吗？我至今还记得我第一天来这里的情形……

"If there had been an attack, I would have asked to be deployed regardless," replied Rei, determination filling her eyes. "The Angels must be defeated, and though you are a strong pilot you do not have an AT-Field to protect yourself. I will fight with you. Even if my body is battered and broken, I will be your shield."
如果遭遇攻击，我定会请求出战，" Rei 坚定地回应，眼中闪烁着决心。"我们必须击败天使，尽管你驾驶技术高超，却无 AT 力场护身。我将与你并肩作战，哪怕身躯支离破碎，也要成为你的护盾。

Shinji averted his gaze, blushing slightly. "Um... thanks, Rei."
真嗣脸颊微红，目光移向别处，轻声说道：“嗯...谢谢你，绫波。”

"As it is, I believe something is being planned," Rei went on. "Doctor Akagi came to see me yesterday and said she wanted to perform a sync test soon."
事实上，我确信有些计划正在酝酿中，" 丽接着说。"昨天赤木博士来找我，提到她打算不久后进行一次同步测试。

"How soon?" 什么时候？

"Tomorrow." 明天。

"Tomorrow?" Shinji repeated in surprise. "I haven't been paying attention to your Eva, but have they finished repairing it? The arms were completely infected weren't they?"
明天？" 真嗣惊讶地重复道，"我没留意你的 Eva，难道他们已经修好了？手臂不是彻底被感染了吗？

Rei nodded. "Yes. They would have destroyed the infected arms and produced replacements. By now they should be attached at the very least, and I am recovered enough for testing." She slowly rubbed her arms as if she was trying to convince her brain they were still there.
瑞点头道：“没错。他们会销毁受感染的手臂，并制造新的替换。现在应该已经接好了，我也恢复得差不多了，可以开始测试。”她轻轻地揉着双臂，似乎在努力让大脑相信它们依旧存在。

"Well in that case," said Shinji, standing up. "I'll get out of your hair for the time being. There's somewhere else I want to go while I'm still able to keep myself away from the Eva cages."
既然如此，" 新二站起身说道，"我先不打扰你了。趁现在还能远离 Eva，我打算去个地方。

Rei seemed to know what he meant, judging by how her naturally pale face went a few more shades towards pure white. "Y-yes," she stammered. "I... shall see you tomorrow."
丽似乎领会了他的意图，从她那本就苍白的脸上又添了几分惨白便可见一斑。"是...是的，"她有些口吃地说。"我们明天见。"

For a brief moment Shinji considered changing his mind and staying, but reassuring words failed to come to mind and in the end all he could do was give a pathetic farewell wave and retreat to the corridor.
短暂的一瞬，真嗣曾想过改变主意留下，然而安慰的话语却难以浮现心头，最终他只能无奈地挥手道别，转身退入走廊。

He would have gone straight to where NERV was holding Kensuke, except there was one little problem; he had no idea where that was. Shinji took out his phone and stared at it, before realising that Misato would likely be too busy to talk, and that he had no idea what Doctor Akagi's number was.
他原本可以直接去 NERV 关押健介的地点，但有个小麻烦：他压根不清楚那地方在哪儿。真嗣拿出手机凝视着，随即想到美里可能正忙得无暇他顾，况且他也不晓得赤木博士的联系方式。

And so, despite his best efforts, Shinji found himself returning to Unit-02's cage.
尽管真嗣尽了最大努力，最终还是发现自己回到了二号机的机库。

XXX

"Damnit." Doctor Akagi tapped her tablet against the side of her head, oblivious to Shinji's approach. "I'm sure this can be done. We just haven't found the right configuration yet."
真是的。" 阿卡吉医生用平板电脑敲了敲自己的头，对真嗣的走近毫无察觉。"这事肯定能成。我们只是还没找到合适的配置方案。

"Excuse me?" 不好意思，您说什么？

She turned around, fixing him with a stare. "Shinji? Didn't expect to see you back here so soon."
她转过身，目光紧紧锁定在他身上。“真嗣？没想到你这么快就回来了。”

Shinji blinked. His gaze had been gradually drifting up to Unit-02's head, and he forced it back down to Doctor Akagi. "Well I did go and see Rei, but afterwards I realised I had no idea where you're actually keeping Kensuke."
真嗣眨了眨眼，原本目光逐渐上移至二号机的头部，此刻又强迫自己将视线转回到赤木博士身上。“我确实去找过绫波，但后来我才发现，我压根不知道你把剑介藏在了哪儿。”

Doctor Akagi stared at him. "You didn't think to ask somebody down there?" At his guilty expression, she sighed and her face softened. "Of course not. Your... obsession is pretty damn strong. I'm starting to wonder if all this dual synchronisation was really worth it."
医生阿卡吉凝视着他。“你没考虑过在那边问问人吗？”见他一脸愧疚，她叹了口气，神情柔和下来。“显然没有。你的……痴迷太深了。我开始怀疑，这一切的双重同步是否真的有价值。”

"What?" Shinji frowned in puzzlement at her.
"什么？" 真嗣皱起眉头，不解地望着她。

"Nobody knows the long term effects of having two minds linked together, not even me. Add to that the fact that you're still growing and maturing, and this could be doing irreparable damage to your psyche. Hrm." Doctor Akagi tapped on her tablet. "I'm making a note to check your psychograph after tomorrow's test against what we recorded when you first arrived. Anyway, I suppose I may as well take you to visit your friend, little as there is to actually see. I want to have a quick look myself to check up." She sighed heavily. "Never get into a job like mine if you hate constantly running from one end of your workplace to the other."
没人能预知两个心灵长期相连的长远影响，我也一样。何况你还在成长成熟，这可能对你的心理造成无法弥补的伤害。嗯。"阿卡吉医生敲打着平板。"我正记录下来，明天测试后要对比你的心理图，看看与初来时有什么变化。我想，我还是带你去见见你的朋友吧，虽然也没什么可看的。我自己也想快速检查一下，确认情况。"她重重地叹了口气。"如果你不喜欢在工作中来回奔波，千万别做我这行。

Shinji nodded and began to follow her as she left the cage, but he couldn't stop his head from turning to give Unit-02 one last look. He tried to memorise the route that they were taking, and by the time they came to a stop outside a door with a bio-hazard warning label, he was vaguely confident he could return on his own.
真嗣点头后，跟随她离开了笼子，却不由自主地回头望了二号机最后一眼。他努力记下他们走过的路线，当他们停在一扇贴有生物危害警告的门前时，他已大致有把握能独自找回这里。

The two of them waited for the door to slowly hiss open and stepped into a tiny antechamber. The entry door closed and a second one opened after a brief delay, letting them into a room with terminals, large screens, and a window looking into another room. Through the window, Shinji could see something akin to a metal coffin emblazoned with NERV logos and warnings.
两人静候门缓缓开启，随即踏入一间狭小的前厅。入口门随即关闭，片刻后，另一扇门打开，引领他们进入一间配备有终端、大型显示屏和一扇窥视另一房间的窗户的室内。透过窗户，真嗣瞥见一个形似金属棺材的装置，其上醒目地印着 NERV 的标志与警示。

"We're taking every precaution we can," said Doctor Akagi. "That room was built to the same specifications as an Eva test chamber. And if a breakout does occur, this entire section will be locked down and these two rooms will be purged with fire."
阿贺木医生说：'我们正在尽一切可能采取预防措施。那个房间是按照 Eva 测试室的规格建造的。一旦发生泄漏，整个区域将立即封锁，这两个房间将进行火化处理。'

The technician in the room, that Shinji only just now noticed, flinched slightly at her clinical description of the safety precautions.
真嗣刚刚才注意到房间里的技术员，听到她对安全措施的冷静描述时，不禁微微一惊。

Doctor Akagi waved a hand at one of the screens. "Would you like to see for yourself what we're dealing with here? I must warn you, it's really not pleasant to look at."
医生阿卡吉向其中一个屏幕挥了挥手。“您想亲自确认一下我们所面对的情况吗？我得提醒您，那画面实在令人不适。”

Shinji thought for a moment, glancing at the box in the next room. The way she had spoken, he knew it was going to be an understatement. "...Yeah," he finally said. "I want to see him."
真嗣沉思片刻，目光掠过隔壁房间的箱子。从她的话语中，他察觉到这不过是轻描淡写。“……是的，”他终于开口，“我想见他。”

She gave him a look as if to say 'I did warn you', before signalling to the technician. A few seconds later, an image appeared on the main screen that made Shinji recoil in shock despite the warning.
她瞥了他一眼，似乎在说“我早就提醒过你”，接着向技术人员打了个手势。不久，主屏幕上显现的画面令真嗣即便有所预料，仍不禁惊得倒退一步。

A bluish mass covered most of Kensuke's body; only his head, right arm and part of his chest were still free of the stuff, but blue lines could be seen crisscrossing his exposed flesh. The entire mass was slowly pulsating at about the same rate as a human heart beat.
肯斯克的身体大部分被一团蓝绿色物质覆盖，仅头部、右臂及部分胸膛裸露，其上可见蓝色线条纵横交错。这团物质正以与人心跳相近的节奏缓缓搏动。

"Oh... gods..." Shinji breathed in abject horror. "Are... are you sure he's even still alive?"
哦...天哪..." 真嗣惊恐万分地喘息着。"你...你真的确定他还活着吗？

Doctor Akagi gave him a grim nod. "He is. There's neural activity that still matches his own records, and that's the only reason we haven't incinerated the body yet. Well... that and his father begging us to try and save him. But unfortunately, nothing we do can stop the spread. The best we've managed is slowing it to a crawl. At this rate it'll only be a couple more weeks until he's fully infected. But if it comes down to it, we'll euthanize him before it reaches his brain."
医生阿卡吉神情严肃地点了点头。“确实如此。他的神经活动依旧与之前的记录相符，这是我们尚未火化遗体的唯一原因。当然，还有他父亲苦苦哀求我们尽力救治。遗憾的是，我们无法阻止病毒扩散。目前最好的办法也只是将其蔓延速度减至极慢。照此趋势，不出几周他便会彻底感染。一旦形势不妙，我们会在病毒侵袭大脑前为他实施安乐死。”

"Is it... the Angel itself?" asked Shinji. "Trying to survive through him?"
这是...天使本身吗？" 碇真嗣问道。"难道是通过他来延续生命？

"No, there's no Blue Pattern we can detect. This is just... leftover biomass attempting to fulfil a biological imperative. It's also fused with his nervous system. If we try to cut it away, it's as if we're sticking a knife directly into his body. His neural activity just goes berserk." She reached up and rubbed at her forehead with the fingers of one hand. "We should have simply operated right when he was brought in. He might have lost his limbs but at least he would be alive and untainted."
不，我们并未检测到任何蓝色图案。这只是...残留的生物组织在试图履行其生物本能。而且它已经与他的神经系统融合。如果我们尝试切除，无异于直接将刀刺入他的身体。他的神经活动会因此失控。"她抬起一只手，用手指轻揉额头。"我们本该在他刚送来时立即手术。他或许会失去四肢，但至少能保住性命，不被污染。

Shinji slowly approached the screen, staring at the image of his friend slowly being consumed by the corpse of an Angel. Was he going to lose two friends at once to the Angels? His right hand began spasmodically clenching and unclenching. "Is he at least completely unconscious like this? Does he feel anything?"
真嗣缓缓靠近屏幕，目不转睛地看着朋友正被天使的遗骸一点点吞没。难道他注定要同时失去两个朋友于天使之手？他的右手不由自主地抽搐着，握紧又松开。“他现在至少是完全无意识的状态吗？他是否还能感受到什么？”

Doctor Akagi shook her head. "He's essentially in a coma unless we try to interfere. Small mercies, I guess. I can't imagine actually being awake while something tries to slowly infest your entire body."
阿卡吉医生摇了摇头说：“除非我们介入，否则他基本上处于昏迷状态。这或许算是小小的安慰。我实在难以想象，如果真的清醒着，感受某种东西逐渐侵蚀全身，会是怎样的折磨。”

Pulling his eyes away from the screen, Shinji instead focused on the box in the next room. "I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you don't think you can save him."
真嗣将目光从屏幕上移开，转而凝视着隔壁房间的箱子。“我冒昧猜测一下，你觉得自己救不了他。”

The silence behind him was all the answer he needed.
他身后的一片寂静，便是他所求的全部答案。

DAY 13 第 13 日

Shinji slowly got out of bed, trying to force the image of Kensuke being fully absorbed before being burned alive out of his head. He made to leave the bunkroom but halted when he saw the greenery attached to the door. He stared at the wreath for a few seconds before checking his phone.
真嗣慢慢从床上起身，努力将健介被完全吞噬并活活烧死的场景从脑海中驱散。他正要走出寝室，却因注意到门上挂着的绿植而止步。他凝视着花环片刻，随后查看了手机。

'Christmas Day. That really sneaked up on me,' he mused with a sigh. 'Not like it matters at this point, since I couldn't leave to buy a present even if I knew what to get.'
'圣诞节啊，真是猝不及防，'他叹了口气，若有所思。'不过现在也无所谓了，就算我知道该买什么礼物，也出不去买。'

Despite the sync test not being for another hour or so, Shinji headed off for the pilot changing room. Though he was a little hungry, he still remembered Asuka's advice about avoiding meals before sitting in LCL and steered clear of the cafeteria, even as his stomach began to grumble. Once he arrived at the changing room, he got out of yesterday's clothes, got into the shower and turned the heat up. He then immediately turned it back down to lukewarm as memories of the almost-disastrous volcano mission surfaced.
虽然同步测试还有一个小时左右才开始，真嗣还是提前去了驾驶员更衣室。尽管肚子有点饿，他还是牢记明日香的忠告，避免在进入 LCL 前吃东西，因此忍着饥饿避开了食堂。到了更衣室，他换下昨天的衣物，进入淋浴间，一开始调高了水温，但很快又调回微温，因为那次几乎酿成大祸的火山任务的记忆突然涌上心头。

It seemed his mind just didn't want to behave today, which could become a problem if he couldn't shape up before the test started. With plenty of time before the test Shinji stood in the shower for a while, trying to blank his mind like a monk sitting under a waterfall. It wasn't very effective; his thoughts were constantly jumping into the spotlight, demanding to be heard, only to be shoved out of the way by something else a moment later.
今天他的思绪似乎特别不安分，如果在考试前还不能调整过来，恐怕会带来麻烦。考试前还有不少时间，真嗣站在淋浴下，试图像瀑布下的僧侣那样清空心绪。然而效果并不佳，他的思绪不断跳出来要求关注，却又迅速被其他念头所取代。

No doubt he'd catch hell for it from Doctor Akagi amid demands to 'concentrate', as if he could just flip a switch and laser focus on one thing but was simply choosing not to.
无疑，赤木医生会因此对他严加斥责，要求他“集中精神”，好像他只要一按开关就能立刻聚焦于一点，而他只是选择不这么做。

Some amount of time later Shinji turned the shower off, trudged over to his locker, and got suited up. Then he began possibly the slowest trip from the change room to the testing lab in NERV history.
一段时间后，真嗣关掉淋浴，步履沉重地走向储物柜，穿戴整齐。接着，他踏上了或许是 NERV 历史上从更衣室到测试实验室最缓慢的一段路程。

XXX

It was like he was psychic. No matter how much Shinji tried to follow Doctor Akagi's instructions, he just couldn't focus to the degree he was formerly capable of, and his sync ratio had plummeted. He could hear the frustration in the scientist's voice, but there was simply nothing he could do. Mercifully, this testing period wasn't going to last for several hours.
他似乎能预知未来一般。尽管真嗣竭力按照赤木博士的指示行事，却始终难以恢复往日的专注力，同步率急剧下滑。他听得出科学家声音中的沮丧，然而自己却束手无策。所幸，这个测试阶段并不会持续数小时之久。

"Alright, Shinji," said Doctor Akagi. "Hop out of your plug, but stay where you are for the moment."
好了，真嗣，"阿卡吉博士说道，"你可以从插入栓里出来了，不过暂时先留在原地。

Shinji did as instructed, waiting on the gantry next to Unit-01 and watching with mild curiosity as a mechanical arm latched onto the entry plug and took it away. A moment later another arm arrived with another plug; one emblazoned with 'DS-PLUG-01'.
真嗣遵照指示，在零号机旁的步道上静候，带着几分好奇注视着机械臂抓住插入栓并将其移走。不久，另一只机械臂携带着标有'DS-PLUG-01'的插入栓抵达。

"Oh," he said to himself. "Of course. They're going to see if Rei and I can work together like..."
哦，" 他自言自语，"原来如此。他们想验证我和零是否能像……

"Correct," said a soft voice nearby.
“正确，”附近一个柔和的声音说道。

As he expected, Shinji saw Rei walking past Unit-01. He waited until she ascended the stairs and stood in front of him before he spoke. "Well... I guess all we can do is hope for the best."
不出所料，真嗣看到绫波从初号机旁经过。他等到她走上楼梯，站在自己面前，才开口：“看来，我们只能寄希望于一切顺利了。”

Rei nodded, but her expression was somewhat hesitant. "I most certainly do not wish to replace Asuka, but we must make this attempt in order to keep humanity safe."
绫点头表示同意，但脸上带着几分迟疑。“我绝无取代明日香之意，然而为了人类的安全，我们不得不进行这次尝试。”

"Yeah... yeah," Shinji glumly conceded as the plug was shifted into position and the hatch opened. He turned and stepped up into the plug, taking his customary forward position.
"嗯...嗯，" 真嗣闷闷不乐地应声，眼看着插头被安置到位，舱门随之开启。他转身踏上插入栓，习惯性地站到了前方的位置。

"Okay, this is just going to be a quick activation test to begin with," said Doctor Akagi after Rei took her seat. "If all goes well we'll throw a couple simulations at you."
好的，我们先做一个简单的激活测试，"赤木博士在绫波坐定后说。"如果顺利的话，接下来会进行几轮模拟训练。

The plug filled with LCL and the power up sequence began. As they approached the absolute borderline, Shinji began to feel a tingle in the back of his head. He reached up, rubbing at the spot with a gloved hand, but the sensation persisted.
插头内灌满了 LCL，通电程序随即启动。随着他们逼近绝对边界，真嗣感到后脑勺传来一阵刺痛。他伸手用戴着的手套轻揉该处，然而那感觉并未消退。

"Shinji, are you... ngh..." Whatever Rei was going to ask was cut off by a grunt of pain.
"真嗣，你... 呃..." 绫波丽原本要问的话，被一声痛苦的呻吟打断了。

"Absolute bord-" 极致的边缘-

He didn't hear the rest of the sentence. Shinji blinked, and found himself staring at a dark room, the floor flooded with what looked like LCL. He shook his head and tried to bring up a hand to rub at his eyes, but his hands seemed to be stuck fast. Looking over to his right, he saw that his hand wasn't just stuck, it was pierced through by a massive nail-
他没听清句子的后半部分。真嗣眨了眨眼，发现自己正凝视着一个昏暗的房间，地面被看似 LCL 的液体淹没。他摇摇头，想抬起手揉眼睛，却发现双手动弹不得。转头向右，他惊恐地看到，自己的手不仅被固定，还被一根巨型钉子贯穿了。

A jolt of electricity shot through Shinji's skull and he yelled in pain, finding himself back in the entry plug. The system was dark and the LCL was steadily draining away; apparently the test had been stopped.
一股电流突然贯穿真嗣的头颅，他痛得大喊，发现自己已回到插入栓中。四周一片黑暗，LCL 液正缓缓排出，看来测试已被紧急停止。

"Are you two alright?!" came a worried shout over the comm unit.
"你们俩还好吗?!" 通讯设备中传来一声焦急的呼喊。

"I... think so," Shinji weakly responded. He got up out of his seat, feeling like his legs were made of rubber, and turned towards the hatch to see that Rei didn't seem any more stable on her feet than him. He moved over to her, putting a hand on her hip and one of her arms over his shoulders, and together they headed for the now open hatchway.
"我...我觉得是这样，" 真嗣有气无力地回应。他艰难地从座位上站起来，双腿软绵绵的，仿佛不是自己的。他望向舱门，看到绫波丽也摇摇晃晃，站不稳。他靠近她，一手揽住她的腰，一手扶着她的肩膀，两人相互扶持着走向敞开的舱门。

The moment they were on the gantry, Rei tilted her head closer to him. "Shinji," she whispered. "Please do not speak of whatever you may have seen."
他们一踏上高台，绫波丽就凑近他，低声说：“真嗣，请不要提起你看到的任何事情。”

"Huh?" Shinji replied. "What I-"
啊？" 真嗣应声道。"我-

"Doctor Akagi," she suddenly said in a louder voice. "I believe that we will be alright in a few minutes." She pulled away from Shinji and headed down the steps to where Doctor Akagi and Misato were waiting.
"安吉医生，" 她突然提高音量说道，"我觉得我们很快就能恢复正常。" 她离开真嗣，走下台阶，向着安吉医生和美里所在的地方走去。

"Are you sure?" Misato worriedly asked. "Apparently there was some nasty feedback just as you hit the borderline. The two of you were completely unconscious for a few seconds."
你确定没事吗？" 碇真嗣担忧地询问。"就在你触及临界点的那一刻，似乎有强烈的反馈。你们两个都昏迷了几秒钟。

"Perhaps these two simply do not have the compatibility that Shinji and Asuka do," Doctor Akagi theorised. "Maybe it's only their... unique circumstances that allow them to synchronise with each other."
或许这两人之间缺乏真嗣与明日香那样的默契，"赤木博士推测，"或许是他们特有的境遇才促成了彼此的同步。

"Whatever it is, I think we can put this idea to bed," replied Misato. "Especially since right now we're basically toying with the only two pilots we have available."
不管怎样，我觉得我们该放弃这个念头了，" 米萨托回应说。"毕竟眼下我们只是在摆弄仅有的两位飞行员。

Doctor Akagi nodded ruefully. "Alright, go get some rest you two. If you don't feel any better after an hour or so, let us know immediately."
医生阿卡吉无奈地点头道：“行，你们俩去休息吧。要是过了一小时左右还是不见好，就马上通知我们。”

"Yes ma'am," said Shinji and Rei. He was still swaying slightly, but he didn't feel like his legs were about to disappear from underneath him as he made his way to the cage entrance. In the corridor, he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder. He turned his head to see Rei's eye's glancing around, before focusing on him.
"是的，女士，" 新二和零齐声回答。尽管身体还在微微摇晃，但他感觉双腿还算稳固，便朝着笼子入口走去。走廊中，一只手轻轻按住他的肩膀，他回头一看，发现零的目光正四处寻找，最终定格在他身上。

"I meant what I said before," she quietly told him. "It is entirely possible that you may be punished for revealing anything that you might have seen during that test."
我之前所言非虚，"她低声对他说。"你极有可能因透露测试中所见而被惩处。

"Rei?" Shinji replied nervously. "What did I see?"
绫波？" 新吉紧张地回应道，"我究竟看到了什么？

She looked away, silent for a few seconds. "I cannot tell you. I am sorry, but I simply cannot. Just promise me that you will keep it to yourself."
她转开视线，沉默了片刻。“我无法告诉你。真的很抱歉，但我实在不能透露。你只需答应我，将此事保密。”

Shinji stared at her for what felt like an hour, and gave a shaky nod. Rei returned it and, without even bidding him farewell, took off at a fast walk down the corridor, leaving a stunned Shinji staring at her retreating back.
真嗣凝视着她，仿佛过了一个世纪，最终颤抖着点了点头。绫波同样点头回应，却未留下任何告别的话语，便快步沿着走廊离去，留下真嗣呆立原地，目送她的背影渐行渐远。

"Oh good, you're still here," said Doctor Akagi from behind him.
"哦，太好了，你还在，"阿卡吉医生从他身后说道。

Still reeling from Rei's strange behaviour, Shinji somewhat absently turned his attention to her. "What is it, Doctor?" he asked, his mind's eye still seeing Rei's almost fearful face.
绫波的异常举止让真嗣心神不宁，他有些走神地看向她。“什么事，医生？”他问道，脑海里依旧浮现出绫波那张略带惊恐的脸。

"First of all, I did what I said I would and compared your psychographs." Her ever-present tablet was thrust in front of his face, and he tried to focus on the wavy line on the screen. "I'll get right to the point. As I expected, your current neural activity is far different than when you first arrived, even allowing for natural mental development. All the dual synchronisation we've put you through has radically altered your brain pattern."
首先，我履行了承诺，对比了你的心理图谱。"她手中的平板电脑递到他眼前，他费力地聚焦于屏幕上的波动线条。"开门见山地说，不出我所料，你现在的脑部活动与你初来时相比已截然不同，即使考虑到正常的心理成长。我们为你实施的所有双重同步训练已彻底改变了你的大脑活动模式。

"...Considering everything Asuka and I have been through, I can't really say I'm surprised," said Shinji. "Is there anything you could do to... set things right again?"
...想想明日香和我共同经历的种种，我其实并不意外，" 真嗣说道。"你有没有办法让一切...恢复如初？

Doctor Akagi shook her head. "Nothing that would be immediately effective. You'd have to spend a long time away from dual synchronisation, hell even piloting in general, to let your brain pattern return to what would be its natural state."
阿卡吉医生摇了摇头说：“没有立竿见影的办法。你需要长时间避免双重同步，甚至完全不驾驶，才能让脑电波恢复到原本的自然状态。”

"And that's not an option, especially now."
况且这并非可行之选，尤其在当下。

"Of course not," she sadly agreed. "I hate to say it, but the safety of humanity comes before what, in the grand scheme of things, boils down to some odd mental quirks. Anyway, the second bit of news... I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you. It's something you're really not going to like."
当然不是，"她带着悲伤同意道。"我真不愿这么说，但人类的安全毕竟比那些在大局中显得微不足道的心理怪癖更为重要。至于第二条消息……我不会对你隐瞒，这确实是你不愿听到的。

Shinji felt his stomach turn to ice. "...What's going on?"
真嗣感到胃里一阵冰凉。“...到底发生了什么？”

"The Committee have decided that we're making no progress on extracting Asuka from Unit-02. They've changed their mind on giving us the whole month; they want us to put the Eva away tomorrow."
委员会已决定，我们在解救二号机中的明日香方面未见进展。他们改变了原先的计划，不再允许我们使用整个月的时间；现在要求我们明天就将 Eva 收回。

'They're taking Asuka away.'
他们正把明日香带走。

It was hours later, and Shinji had barely moved from the changing room bench he had collapsed onto after Doctor Akagi's grim news. Angry words had been said, but there was nothing she could do to get that time back. All she could do was give her most sincere apologies before making a hasty retreat. Misato had come out of the cages a minute later, seen the look on his face, and hugged him without care for the LCL she was smearing on her clothing. He had been too shell-shocked to respond with anything more than grunts and mumbles, so she had gently directed him to the changing room.
几小时过去了，真嗣依旧瘫坐在更衣室的长凳上，那是他在得知赤木博士的噩耗后倒下的地方。尽管愤怒的话语已经出口，但逝去的时间无法追回。赤木博士只能匆忙离开前，表达她最真挚的歉意。不久，美里从隔离区走出，一看到真嗣的表情，便不顾自己衣服上沾染的 LCL，紧紧抱住了他。真嗣震惊得只能发出咕哝和含糊的声音，美里便温柔地引导他前往更衣室。

And now, of all times, Shinji's mind was completely blank. Had he been coherent enough to care, he might have laughed about how it took such horrible news to do what he couldn't do himself. Right before punching himself for thinking something so blatantly stupid.
此刻，真嗣的思绪竟是一片空白。若他神智尚清，或许会自嘲，竟是这般噩耗才让他得以忘却自我。随后，他又会因这荒谬的想法而自责不已。

It took an aching rear end and back for Shinji's mind to return enough to realise how long he'd been sitting hunched over on the hard wooden bench. He glanced up at the clock above the doorway, dully noting that it was well after dinner time. Yet despite not having eaten anything since yesterday, he did not feel the least bit hungry.
真嗣的意识因臀部和背部的疼痛而逐渐恢复，这才意识到自己蜷缩在硬木长凳上已久。他抬头望向门上方的时钟，木然发现早已过了晚饭时间。尽管自昨日以来滴水未进，他却丝毫没有饥饿感。

'They're taking Asuka away.'
他们正把明日香带走。

Shinji stood up, his joints popping and flakes of dried LCL crumbling off of him. His legs, slow to wake back up, eventually managed to carry him over to the shower where a blast of cold water managed to clear some of the fog from his head. He knew that Asuka would absolutely hate to see him like this, likely shouting and swearing in German at him to pull himself together, but he was about to lose the one person he was able to feel truly close to in a decade.
真嗣艰难地站起来，关节嘎吱作响，干涸的 LCL 碎屑纷纷落下。他的双腿起初反应迟缓，但最终还是支撑他走到淋浴间，冷水一浇，头脑中的迷雾随之消散。他清楚，明日香若见到他这般颓废，必定会用德语严厉斥责，催促他振作，然而他即将失去这十年来唯一能让他感到亲近的人。

As much as it pained him to admit it, there was nothing he could do; once again, he was useless.
尽管承认这一点让他心痛，但他束手无策；又一次，他觉得自己一无是处。

'They're taking Asuka away.'
他们要把明日香带走了。

Ritsuko sighed as she headed into the Evangelion cage, preparing to do one final check on Unit-02 before putting it into storage tomorrow morning. She passed by Unit-00 with barely a glance but slowed down near Unit-01, frowning at it and wondering if the Committee would have been so quick to put their tool on ice if it had been the one that absorbed both an Angel's core and a pilot.
律子轻叹一声，步入初号机的机库，打算在翌日清晨将其封存前，对二号机进行最后一次检查。她对零号机几乎视而不见，但在一号机旁放缓了脚步，眉头紧锁，心中暗忖，若是一号机吸收了使徒核心与驾驶员，委员会是否还会如此急切地将其束之高阁。

Of course they still wouldn't have given a damn about the pilot. The old men thought they were the most important people after all. One pilot, hundreds of civilian casualties, billions of Second Impact victims... all that mattered to them was Instrumentality on their terms.
自然，他们依旧不会对那位飞行员有丝毫关心。那些老者自视甚高，认为自己是至高无上的存在。一个飞行员的生死，数百无辜平民的牺牲，数十亿因第二次冲击而受难的人们……这一切在他们眼中，都不及按照他们的意愿推进人类补完计划来得重要。

Commander Ikari wasn't much better in that regard. He had been part of the Katsuragi Expedition that had triggered Second Impact, leaving the day before purely by coincidence with a copy of all their recorded data. He had originally been on board with the Committee's plan only because wherever Yui Ikari went, he tagged along behind like a puppy, but then she had been absorbed into Unit-01. And now he was going along with the plan to initiate Third Impact, but only so far as to hijack it for his own ends. Despite her best efforts to try and get him to move on and accept the loss of his wife, he was instead planning to use Third Impact just to be with Yui again.
碇司令在这方面同样不甚高明。他曾是触发第二次冲击的葛城探险队成员，巧合地在冲击前一天带着全部数据记录离开。起初，他支持委员会的计划，仅仅是因为追随妻子碇唯，但随后碇唯被零号机吸收。现在，他参与引发第三次冲击，实则是为了将其操控于自己手中。尽管有人尽力劝他放下，接受失去妻子的现实，他却执意利用第三次冲击，只为与碇唯重逢。

Coming up to Unit-02's cage, Ritsuko once again wondered if the son would have done the same thing as the father if given the opportunity. And speaking of the boy, to her complete lack of surprise Shinji was there in front of the red Evangelion. He was still in his plugsuit, hands clenched around the gantry railing, staring up at Unit-02's head. She slowly walked over to him, yet despite clearly being in his peripheral vision Shinji did not so much as twitch his head at her approach.
走近二号机的笼子，律子再次思索，若儿子有机会，是否会步父亲后尘。提及那少年，果不其然，真嗣正站在红色福音战士前。他依旧穿着插入栓服，双手紧抓通道栏杆，凝视着二号机的头部。她缓缓靠近，尽管已进入他的视野边缘，真嗣却对她的到来毫无反应。

'Yes,' she darkly thought. 'He would most definitely burn the world to get the girl he loves back. It's a good thing Unit-01 didn't absorb the Angel's core or that might just end up happening.'
'她暗想：“是的，他为了夺回心爱的女孩，绝对不惜焚尽世界。幸亏初号机未曾吸收使徒的核心，否则后果不堪设想。”'

"I'm not about to ask how you're doing," she said out loud. "I can see it just by looking at you."
我并不打算问你近况如何，"她大声说道，"看你的样子我就明白了。

"...It's not fair, damnit," Shinji quietly replied after several silent seconds. "She doesn't deserve to be trapped in there forever."
...这不公平，真该死，" 真嗣在几秒沉默后低声回应。"她不该永远被困在那里面。

"I know, but the decision's out of our hands now. There's nothing you or I could say to convince the Committee otherwise."
我明白，但现在决定权已不在我们掌控之中。你我再怎么说，也难以让委员会改变决定。

Shinji's hands clenched tighter on the railing for a second, before he pushed himself away and stomped past Ritsuko, heading up the gantry steps to sit down next to the entry plug hatch. Clearly any further conversation with him was not going to happen. She slowly continued walking along the gantry, absently running a hand along the railing, but halted when she felt a slight indentation in the metal, coincidentally where Shinji had been standing. A pair of indentations, in fact; large enough that she could almost fit her hand in them. Her gaze darted between the deformed metal and the boy curled up in a ball at the top of the gantry.
真嗣的手在栏杆上紧握了一瞬，随即他猛地推开，从律子身边大步流星地走向舷梯，坐到了入口插头舱门旁。显然，再与他交谈已无可能。律子缓缓前行，手不经意地抚过栏杆，却在触及一处凹陷时停下脚步，那正是真嗣刚才站立之处。竟是两个颇深的凹痕，大到她几乎能将手探入。她的目光在变形的金属与蜷缩在舷梯顶端的真嗣之间来回游移。

Ritsuko suddenly decided she didn't want to remain here any longer than she absolutely had to.
理子突然决定，她不想在这里多停留一秒。

Shinji peeked at Doctor Akagi over the top of his arms, staring at her until she eventually left the cage. He gave it another fifteen minutes, occasionally glancing up at the control room above Unit-02, before he decided she wasn't coming back today. His body slowly unfolded as he got to his feet, looking around for anybody else that might still be in the area. The control room was dark, Unit-02's repairs were complete, and NERV had given up on trying to rescue Asuka. The cage was empty and likely to remain that way until tomorrow.
真嗣从臂弯间偷偷窥视赤木博士，直至她离开笼子。他又耐心等待了十五分钟，偶尔抬头望向二号机上方的控制室，确认她今日不会返回。他缓缓站起，舒展身躯，四下张望，看是否还有其他人在附近。控制室已熄灯，二号机的维修告一段落，NERV 也已放弃营救明日香的行动。笼子空无一人，恐怕要等到明日才会有人来。

He stood in front of the small computer terminal attached to the gantry, where he took several minutes to look the screen over. Fortunately it was simple enough for him to understand; from here he could access an interface for the system that moved entry plugs around to insert or remove them from an Evangelion. There had been a similar terminal in Unit-00's cage, and though nobody had been using it, it had still shown what was presumably commands from the control room.
他站在与龙门架相连的小型计算机终端前，凝视屏幕数分钟。所幸界面简洁易懂；通过此终端，他能操控系统，将插入栓移入或移出福音战士。零号机机库内亦有类似终端，虽无人操作，却仍显示着控制室下达的指令。

Right now there was some sort of 'signal termination' plug inserted into Unit-02. He wasn't quite sure what its purpose was, but it wasn't what he needed. Shinji hesitantly tapped at the screen a few times, soon working out how to extract the plug. The noise of the system engaging filled the entire cage as a mechanical arm latched onto the plug, and Shinji nervously looked around, expecting security personnel to come charging in at any second.
此时，二号机内被插入了一个“信号终止”插头。真嗣虽不清楚其具体用途，却明白这不是他所需之物。他迟疑地轻触屏幕数次，不久便掌握了拔出插头的方法。随着系统启动，机械臂紧抓插头，噪音响彻整个机舱，真嗣紧张地四下张望，担心安保人员随时会破门而入。

The arm holding the plug disappeared into the depths of NERV, and Shinji tapped more buttons. A minute later, another arm appeared carrying a much more familiar plug and positioned it at the gap in Unit-02's spine. Shinji frowned; he wouldn't be able to get into the plug and have it inserted... wait...
握着插头的机械臂隐没于 NERV 的深处，真嗣继续按动按钮。片刻后，另一只机械臂携带着一个更为熟悉的插头出现，精准地将其安置在二号机背部的缺口。真嗣眉头紧锁；他意识到自己无法进入插头并完成插入...等等...

Shinji groaned and slapped a palm to his forehead. Of course the entry plugs could be inserted by the pilot. When NERV had been without power, he had had to type a command to manually activate and insert the plug after his father had spoken to him and closed the hatch. As he clambered up into the entry plug, he hoped that he could still remember that command.
真嗣叹了口气，手掌拍在额头上。显然，插入栓本就可以由驾驶员操作。记得 NERV 停电那次，他得输入指令手动激活并插入插入栓，那是在父亲与他交谈并关闭舱门之后。他爬进插入栓，暗自希望还能记得那条指令。

Of course Shinji had no intention of trying to activate Unit-02; there was no Angel attacking, and no need to move the Evangelion. He was sure that if he even attempted that, someone would be able to shut it down. No, all he wanted was to be as close to Asuka as he could get without being absorbed himself. Then again, if that somehow managed to happen again, he wasn't sure if he would try and fight against it.
自然，真嗣无意激活二号机；既然没有使徒攻击，也就无需出动福音战士。他深知，一旦尝试启动，定会有人阻止。他真正渴望的，是尽可能靠近明日香，而不被其吞噬。然而，若此情形重演，他也不敢肯定自己是否会抗拒。

Inside the plug, he settled down in the forward seat and brought up the holographic display. It ended up being a simple two button presses to insert the plug, and he turned the screen off while it was asking him to activate the LCL system. The plug went dark again, lit only by faint emergency lighting, and Shinji slowly let out a long breath. It was slightly chilly in here, but he would tolerate it.
在插入栓内，他坐稳前座，启动了全息显示屏。插入过程只需轻按两下按钮，当屏幕提示激活 LCL 系统时，他选择关闭屏幕。插入栓内再次暗下来，仅余微弱的应急灯光，真嗣缓缓地深吸一口气。虽然有些凉意，但他还能忍受。

"Hello a-again, Asuka," he said into the darkness, his voice hitching slightly. "Seems like this might be the last time I get to... get to talk to you. NERV's given up on you, and Unit-02's going to get put into storage tomorrow. I don't know what that'll be like for you, but then again I still don't know if you're even conscious.
"你好，再次见到你，明日香，" 他在黑暗中说道，声音略带哽咽。"这或许是我最后一次与你交谈了。NERV 已经放弃了你，二号机明天将被封存。我不清楚这对你的影响，但说实话，我甚至不确定你是否还有意识。

"They may have stopped caring, but I never will. You're the Great Asuka Langley-Soryu after all. You've been through so much during this war; getting shot several times by a giant laser, almost being crushed by an Angel falling from space, and getting trapped inside an Angel. You didn't let any of that slow you down, and you shouldn't let something stupid like getting absorbed by your Eva keep you down either."
他们或许已不再关心，但我永远不会。毕竟，你是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。在这场战争中，你历经磨难：多次被巨型激光击中，险些被从太空坠落的使徒压垮，甚至一度被困于使徒体内。这些都未曾让你退缩，如今，你也不应因被自己的 Eva 吸收这样的小事而消沉。

Shinji paused for a moment, letting his head drop until his chin rested against his chest. "But me? It's only been a couple weeks and I'm already falling apart. You're stuck in here, Kensuke's being... eaten alive by the remains of an Angel, and... something's going on with Rei. All I can do is stand around and wait for someone else to solve the problem.
真嗣顿了顿，垂下头，下巴紧贴胸口。“至于我？才几周时间，我就已经支撑不住了。你被困于此，剑介正被天使遗骸……吞噬，而绫波那边似乎也出了状况。我只能干站着，等待别人来解决这一切。”

"...I really miss you, Asuka. I just... don't know what to do anymore. Without you I'm practically useless as a pilot. But more importantly than that, you're my best friend. The one I look up to, the one I admire most... the one I-" He cut himself off, blushing heavily. "Well, you already know how I feel about you. I'd do anything to bring you back to m-... to us."
...我真的很想念你，明日香。我...真的不知道该如何是好。没有你，我作为飞行员几乎无用武之地。但更重要的是，你是我最亲密的朋友。我仰望的人，我最敬仰的人...我-" 他突然打住，脸颊绯红。"总之，你明白我对你的心意。我愿意付出一切，只为让你回到我...我们身边。

Shinji let out a dark chuckle, shifting in his seat to try and get comfortable. The entry plug seemed to be getting a little warmer, banishing the chill that had started to seep through his plugsuit. "I wonder what Ms. Bwynvienne would do if she heard me say that. It's just too bad I can't sell her my soul to get you back. After all, you already have it, and it's really served you well. I'm not sure either of us would have made it this far. Heh. Best stupid decision I ever made in my life."
真嗣发出一声阴沉的轻笑，在座位上挪动，试图找到舒适的位置。插入栓似乎变暖了，驱散了开始渗透进驾驶服的寒意。“我在想，如果布温维涅小姐听到我这么说会怎样。真可惜我不能把灵魂卖给她来换回你。毕竟，你已经拥有了它，而且它确实对你很有用。我不确定我们俩是否能走到这一步。呵呵。这是我一生中做过的最愚蠢却最好的决定。”

He fell silent, thinking back over the past year. About meeting Asuka for the first time, and finally being able to put a face to the name. Seeing where Rei lived, and how Asuka had erupted in righteous fury at the mistreatment of a fellow pilot. The incident where she had ignored Misato's warning and tried to climb from one balcony to another. Their rather... unique fishing trip. Everything he and Asuka had been through together, good and bad, enjoyable and scary, hilarious and insane.
他陷入沉默，回想起过去一年的种种。初次遇见明日香的情景，终于将名字与面容对应起来。探访绫波的居所，以及明日香因同伴驾驶员遭受不公而怒火中烧的场面。她不顾美里的警告，试图从一阳台攀至另一阳台的插曲。还有那次颇为...别致的钓鱼之旅。他与明日香共同经历的一切，喜怒哀乐，欢笑与惊险，荒诞与疯狂。

And yet, if given the option, he wouldn't have changed a thing.
尽管如此，若有机会选择，他宁愿一切如故。

"Hope you don't mind, Asuka, but I'm just going to spend the night in here." Shinji adjusted his position again. A pilot seat wasn't nearly as comfortable as he would have liked, but he wasn't about to try and sneak around NERV holding a pillow. "They'll most likely find me in the morning and try to punish me, but I don't care anymore. I'm not about to leave you alone at a time like this."
明日香，希望你别介意，我打算就在这儿过夜。" 真嗣又一次调整了坐姿。驾驶座远没有他期望的舒适，但他也不想带着枕头在 NERV 里鬼鬼祟祟。"他们多半会在早上找到我，并试图惩罚，但我已经无所谓了。这种时候，我绝不会留你一个人。

The plug was still getting warmer. Shinji thought about checking the computer, wondering if he'd bumped something without realising, but then let out a large yawn; whatever the cause, it wasn't important. His eyelids were already getting heavy, and his head drooped to one side.
插头依旧在发热。真嗣本想检查一下电脑，看是否不小心触碰到了什么，但紧接着打了个大大的哈欠；不管是什么原因，此刻都无关紧要了。他的眼皮愈发沉重，头不由自主地歪向一边。

"G'night, 'suka," he managed to slur out. "I... I l've you..."
晚安，'suka，" 他含糊地挤出这句话。"我... 真的爱你...

DAY 14 第 14 日

Ritsuko stepped into Unit-02's cage for what could very well be the last time, sipping from a cup of coffee. The first thing she did was look up the gantry at where she had last seen Shinji. To her surprise, he wasn't there. She thought about this for a moment, before deciding that he must have headed to the bunkroom after all. Shaking her head, she took another sip of coffee, silently urging the caffeine to work faster at melting the cobwebs in her head.
律子最后一次走进二号机的机库，手中捧着一杯咖啡。她首先抬头望向之前见到真嗣的栈桥，却意外地发现他不在那儿。她沉思了一会儿，推测他应该是去了休息室。她摇摇头，又抿了一口咖啡，心中默默希望咖啡因能快些驱散她头脑中的混沌。

Something about the cage was off, Ritsuko suddenly realised, pausing with the cup at her lips as her eyes darted around the cage. She was the only one in here, the Evangelion hadn't moved, Shinji wasn't here but likely would be soon, knowing him...
突然，Ritsuko 察觉到笼子有些异样，她举杯的动作戛然而止，目光迅速在笼子内游走。此刻只有她一人，那台福音战士静止不动，真嗣虽不在场，但依他的性子，估计不久便会到来...

She looked back up the gantry at where he had been sitting yesterday, then headed up the steps. There was the anomaly: there was no signal termination plug inserted into Unit-02 like procedure demanded. Instead the armour plates were closed around the hatch; most likely there was an entry plug inserted instead. Ritsuko checked the terminal, her fingers dancing over the keys as she connected to the control room computer, input her password, and brought up the command history.
她回头望向昨天他坐过的栈桥，随后踏上台阶。异常情况映入眼帘：按照规程，Unit-02 上本应插入信号终止插头，然而装甲板却紧闭着舱口，很可能已插入插入栓。律子迅速操作终端，手指在键盘上灵巧跳动，连接至控制室计算机，输入密码，查看命令历史记录。

Somebody had switched the plugs yesterday evening.
昨晚有人调换了插头。

"Oh... don't tell me," Ritsuko muttered, glancing at the Evangelion. "Surely he wouldn't have... what am I saying, he woulddefinitely have done it. He's just like his father after all."
哦...别告诉我，" 律子低声自语，目光扫过那台福音战士。"他不可能...我这是在说什么，他肯定会这么做。毕竟他和他父亲如出一辙。

She ordered the system to eject the plug and open the hatch. Grumbling to her self, she got ready to hoist herself up to the hatch. She was going to tear him a new one if-
她指示系统弹出插头并开启舱门。嘴里嘟囔着，她做好了将自己拉上去的准备。一旦见到他，非得给他点颜色瞧瞧不可——

If...

Ritsuko stared into the entry plug with open-mouthed shock. The surprise made her lose her grip and fall on her arse on the gantry, but she quickly got back to her feet and climbed back up to confirm what she had just seen.
律子张口结舌地凝视着插入栓，惊愕之下失手跌坐在栈桥上，但她立刻起身，再次攀爬上去，以确认自己刚才目睹的一切。

"Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me..."
哦，你一定是在跟我开玩笑吧...

### Chapter 37 What Took You So Long?

Shinji opened his eyes, staring up at the whiteness above him.
真嗣睁开双眼，仰望着头顶的苍白。

'Unfamiliar cei-... wait...'
'陌生的 cei-... 等等...'

He was not back in the medical wing, as he had automatically thought. The whiteness seemed infinite, both incredibly far away and close enough to touch. But unlike when trapped inside the Twelfth Angel, where the surroundings seemed to be trying to destroy his eyes, this place appeared... benign.
他并未如预想般回到医疗翼。四周的白色仿佛无穷无尽，既遥不可及又近在咫尺。与被困于第十二天使内部时那种试图摧毁视觉的压迫感不同，此地显得颇为平和。

There seemed to be a weight on his chest, but he didn't even feel like checking to see what it was, let alone shifting it. For the first time in a long time, Shinji felt calm and relaxed, as if everything was finally alright in the world. He could just go right to sleep without having to worry about anything.
胸口仿佛有重物压迫，他却连探查的欲望都无，更遑论将其移开。久违的平静与放松感涌上心头，真嗣觉得世界似乎终于回归正轨。他可以无忧无虑地安然入睡。

Actually, falling asleep felt like a really good idea right n-
其实，这时候睡上一觉真是再好不过了，就在-

Shinji opened his eyes, staring up at the whiteness above him.
真嗣睁开双眼，凝望着头顶的苍白。

'Unfamiliar ceiling...?' '陌生的天花板...？'

Now he was in the medical wing; that well-known chemical smell already invading his nostrils like a dog welcoming its owner back home. The weight had disappeared, and he felt an odd sense of loss at its absence.
此刻他身在医疗翼，那熟悉的化学气味仿佛迎接主人归来的忠犬，已悄然侵入他的鼻腔。那份沉重感已不复存在，他却感到一种莫名的失落。

The simple fact that he was laying in bed in the medical wing told Shinji that he'd been discovered. But he had expected to get woken up by whoever discovered him; instead, as far as he could remember, somebody had moved him while he was still asleep. He sat up, and felt something tugging on his wrists. Looking down, Shinji saw that both arms now sported handcuffs that anchored him to the bed, along with something clipped to his right index finger and an IV drip in his arm. Rather than being surprised at where he was, he took it in stride; what he'd done last night had been somewhat illegal after all.
他躺在医疗翼的床上，这一事实清楚地告诉真嗣，自己已被发现。他原以为会被发现他的人唤醒；然而，根据他的记忆，有人在他熟睡时将他转移了。他坐起身来，感觉到手腕上有东西牵扯。低头一看，真嗣发现自己的双臂都戴上了手铐，将他牢牢固定在床上，右手的食指上还夹着监测器，手臂上则挂着静脉输液。对于自己所处的环境，他并未感到惊讶，而是平静接受；毕竟他昨晚的行为确实触犯了法律。

Strangely, he felt rather... calm about the fact that Unit-02 was getting sealed away today. Almost... optimistic.
奇怪的是，他对于今天二号机将被封存这件事，竟然感到异常平静，甚至有些乐观。

Looking around the room, his eyes soon found a clock hanging on the wall, proclaiming it to be just after 08:30 in the morning. His stomach took that moment to loudly rumble.
环视四周，他的视线迅速锁定墙上挂着的时钟，指针刚走过早上 08:30。恰在此时，他的肚子不合时宜地咕噜作响。

'Oh yeah,' Shinji recalled. 'I didn't eat anything at all yesterday...'
'哦，对了，' 真嗣想起来了。'我昨天压根儿没吃东西...'

There was no food waiting for him, not even a glass of water. Then again he wouldn't have been able to eat or drink anyway, with his hands cuffed to the bed. There was a heart monitor next to the bed, connected to the thing on his finger and silently ticking off his heartbeat. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, Shinji laid back down and tried to ignore his empty stomach. Somebody would likely be along eventually to check on him.
那里并未为他备有食物，连一杯水也未见。况且，他的双手被铐在床上，本就无法进食饮水。床旁的心率监测器连接着他手指上的传感器，静静地记录着他的心跳。无处可去，无事可做，真嗣只得再次躺下，尽力不去理会空荡荡的胃。想必迟早会有人来探望他。

It ended up being half an hour before a familiar face came to see him.
最后，等了半小时才有一位熟人来看望他。

"Hello, Shinji," said Misato with all the warmth of a block of ice, arms folded as she stared disapprovingly at him. "Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
你好，真嗣，" 三笠冷若冰霜地说道，双臂交叉，目光中带着不悦。"你有什么要解释的吗？

Shinji went to rub his head, but came up short as the handcuffs clanked against the bed. "Well," he slowly began, marshalling his thoughts. "I... I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you... but I won't apologise for what I did."
真嗣本想摸摸头，却被手铐撞击床铺的声音打断。"这个，"他慢慢地说，努力整理思绪。"我... 对于给你造成的困扰，我表示歉意... 但我不会为我的行为道歉。"

Misato's arms slowly unfolded and her eyes widened in surprise. "'Won't apologise'? You basically commandeered an Evangelion for your own personal use! What the hell were you thinking?!"
真嗣的双臂慢慢展开，眼睛因惊讶而瞪大。“‘不打算道歉’？你简直是擅自把 EVA 当作私用工具了！你究竟是怎么想的？！”

"...You know exactly what I was thinking, ma'am." Considering his circumstances, it didn't seem appropriate to continue acting like normal with Misato... or rather, Major Katsuragi. She was in full officer mode once more. "I'm about to lose my best friend. I wasn't going to let Asuka go without saying goodbye. Ma'am."
...您完全了解我的心思，女士。"鉴于他的处境，再像往常一样与 Misato 相处已不妥当...更确切地说，是与葛城少校。她再次全副武装地进入了军官角色。"我即将失去挚友。我不想让明日香离开而不道别。女士。

She narrowed her eyes at him. "You could have damn well asked, instead of sneaking off to do it yourself."
她眯起眼睛盯着他，说：“你完全可以直接问，何必偷偷摸摸自己去做呢？”

Shinji looked away, unable to maintain eye contact. "With all due respect, ma'am, I know what the answer would have been. And then NERV would have been watching me like a hawk."
真嗣避开目光，难以直视对方。“恕我冒昧，女士，我清楚答案会是什么。那样的话，NERV 就会对我严密监视。”

Major Katsuragi brought up a hand to cover her face, slowly pulling it down to her chin before letting it drop to her side. "Okay, look. You know you did something wrong. Rits and I have just had our asses chewed out for letting you do what you did, and soon it'll be your turn."
葛城少校抬起手遮住脸庞，慢慢滑至下巴，随后垂落至身旁。"听着，你清楚自己犯了错。我和律子刚因为放任你行事而挨了一顿骂，接下来就该轮到你了。"

He quirked an eyebrow. "My turn?"
他扬起一边眉毛，问道：“该我了吗？”

"Of course. You're overdue for a meeting with the Commander."
当然。您与指挥官的会面已经迟了。

Luckily for what remained of his dignity, Shinji was uncuffed and allowed to get dressed. The cuffs went back on before he left the room, and Misato led him through NERV's maze-like layout to the door to Commander Ikari's office. Once there, she simply gave him a stern look before opening the door and beckoning him to enter.
幸而为了维护他仅存的尊严，真嗣得以解开手铐并穿上衣服。离开房间前，手铐再次被扣上，美里领着他穿梭于 NERV 迷宫般的通道，直至司令伊卡里办公室门前。抵达后，她仅以严肃的目光示意，随即开门让他进入。

Shinji slowly walked into the office, and the door closed behind him. The room seemed to stretch out for a mile of black walls, ceiling and flooring, with the only light source being the artificial sunlight from the Geofront tinted red by the windows. As he made his way towards the desk in the middle of the room, Shinji tried to subtly glance at the strange patterns on the floor and ceiling, but couldn't make head nor tail of them.
真嗣缓缓步入办公室，门随之悄然关闭。室内幽暗深邃，墙壁、天花板与地板皆呈黑色，绵延似无尽头，唯一的光线来自 Geofront 的模拟阳光，经窗户染成红色。他向房间中央的桌子走去，途中试图不经意地观察地面和天花板上奇异的图案，却始终摸不着头脑。

He came to a halt in front of the desk, looking across it at his father. Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki was also there, standing behind and to the right of the chair with his arms clasped behind his back. His father, of course, sat with his gloved hands covering his mouth, staring intensely back at him. Tense silence filled the room for a minute until his father finally chose to speak.
他在桌前停下脚步，目光穿过桌面与父亲对视。副指挥官冬月也在场，站在椅子右后方，双手背在身后。他的父亲自然坐在那里，戴着皮手套的双手遮住口部，目光锐利地回望着他。房间内弥漫着紧张的沉默，持续了一分钟后，他的父亲终于打破了沉默。

"You know why you are here," he stated, his mouth barely visible under his hands.
"你知道自己为何在此，"他低声说道，双手几乎遮住了嘴巴。

Shinji nodded. "Because I used an Evangelion for my own personal agenda, sir."
真嗣点头承认：“长官，我为了个人目的动用了福音战士。”

"Indeed. While you did not try to do anything with it, the fact still remains that you acted outside of your authorisation."
确实如此。虽然你并未试图利用它做任何事，但你的行为确实超出了授权范围。

"Yes sir." Shinji tried to maintain his composure despite the tense atmosphere. "Considering what's... supposed to happen with Unit-02 today, I felt it was my last chance to say... goodbye."
是的，先生。" 尽管气氛紧张，真嗣仍努力保持镇定。"鉴于今天 02 机甲将发生的事，我认为这是我最后说... 再见的机会。

"Hrm." 嗯。

Apart from the grunt, his father remained silent, and Shinji felt he had to fill the void. "I do not regret what I did last night, only that Doctor Akagi and Major Katsuragi got in trouble for it."
除了那声咕哝，父亲一直沉默不语，真嗣觉得有必要打破沉默。“我并不后悔昨晚的所作所为，只是对赤木博士和葛城少校因此而陷入困境感到抱歉。”

"You refuse to apologise for doing something so foolish?" asked Fuyutsuki.
"你难道不为这般愚蠢的行为道歉吗？" 福月津追问道。

"Yes sir," Shinji confirmed. "You may find my reasoning petty, but with all due respect I do not care what you think about my motive."
是的，先生，" 碇真嗣肯定地说。"您或许认为我的理由不值一提，但我必须直言，我并不在意您对我的动机作何评价。

To his mild surprise, Shinji saw the corner of the elderly man's mouth curve slightly upwards. What was even more surprising was the ever-so-slightly raised eyebrow on his father's face.
真嗣略感意外地发现，老人的嘴角微微上扬。而更让他惊讶的是，父亲脸上那微不可察的挑眉。

"Well anyway," said Fuyutsuki. "Currently we cannot afford to simply put you in lock-up for your actions. After all, it'll still be a little longer before Ayanami is back on active duty, and even then we only have two pilots."
嗯，不管怎样，" 绫波说道，"目前我们无法仅因你的行为就将你拘禁。毕竟，绫波还需一段时间才能复职，而我们仅有两名飞行员。

"Yes," Father agreed. "But overall this is, relatively speaking, a minor offence. Not to mention this is the first time you have been brought up on a disciplinary charge-"
是的，"父亲表示同意。"但总体来看，这算是比较轻微的过错。何况这还是你首次因违纪问题被提出指控——

"Second, sir," Shinji corrected, wincing slightly at his own interruption as both men on the other side of the desk gave him a cool look. "There was that time after the Fourth Angel where I... ran away..."
其次，先生，" 真嗣纠正道，因自己打断对话而略感尴尬，对面桌前的两位男士冷冷地看了他一眼。"在第四使徒事件后，我……确实逃跑了……

"...True," Father conceded. "Then, however, you were little more than a backup pilot, and Major Katsuragi handled the offence."
...确实如此，"父亲承认说。"那时你只是个替补飞行员，主要进攻任务由葛城少校负责。

"And of course afterwards, you went through a week of hell," Fuyutsuki remarked. "After you practically begged to be included in training, Pilot Soryu threw everything she had at you in the simulator."
当然，事后你经历了一周的煎熬，" 冬月评论说。"在你几乎恳求参与训练后，飞行员 Soryu 在模拟器中对你毫不留情。

Shinji's face flushed at the reminder of that week.
提到那一周，真嗣的脸颊不禁泛起红晕。

"Considering the circumstances," Father continued. "For now you may consider yourself on probation until further notice. Any further transgressions will not be dealt with so lightly. Am I clear?"
鉴于目前的情况，"父亲接着说，"暂时你将被视为处于观察期，直至另行通知。若再有违规，处理就不会这么轻描淡写了。明白了吗？

"Yes sir," replied Shinji.
"是的，先生，" 真嗣回答道。

"Very well then. Dismissed."
很好，那就这样吧。解散。

Shinji made to salute, only to remember that his hands were still cuffed together. Instead, he gave a deep bow to the two men before turning around and walking towards the office door. Once he was several metres away, he let out his breath in a deep but quiet sigh.
真嗣本欲敬礼，却蓦然记起双手仍被铐住。他便向两位男士深深鞠了一躬，随后转身朝办公室门走去。走出几米后，他才深深地、却又悄无声息地叹了口气。

Gendo stared at his son's back as Shinji left the room, his gaze only shifting once the door closed behind the boy.
源渡目送儿子真嗣离开房间，直到门在真嗣身后关上，他的视线才移开。

"Your son has certainly come a long way," said Fuyutsuki. "It looks like his relationship with the Second Child has greatly improved his resolve."
你的儿子确实进步了好多，" 伏月司说道。"他与第二适格者的关系似乎极大地坚定了他的决心。

"Perhaps," Gendo mused. "Of course, there are the occasions where they've had their minds merged together."
源堂若有所思地说：'当然，他们心智曾融合在一起的情况也时有发生。'

"True, but despite those incidents causing your son to occasionally act like Soryu, I believe his bravery is entirely... self-grown. You caught what he said about his reasoning, didn't you?"
确实，虽然那些事件让您的儿子有时表现得像 Soryu，但我认为他的勇敢完全是自发的。您听到了他解释自己行为的原因，对吧？

"Yes, of course." A small smirk grew on Gendo's face.
"是的，当然。" 源渡的嘴角勾起了一抹淡淡的笑意。

Despite not looking in the old man's direction, he could see the look on his subordinate's face. "Why, I do believe that was almost word for word what I once heard another Ikari say a long time ago. When I had to speak to that young man through the bars of a jail cell."
虽然并未看向老人，他却清楚地看到了下属脸上的神情。“哎，我敢肯定，这几乎是一字不差地重复了我很久以前从另一位伊卡里那里听到的话。那时我不得不隔着牢房的铁栏与那位年轻人交谈。”

"Why did you attack them?"
你为何要攻击他们？

"They insulted Yui." 他们羞辱了 Yui。

"That's your reason for breaking someone's nose?"
这就是你打断别人鼻子的理由？

"You might find it petty, professor, but with all due respect I don't give a damn what you think."
教授，您可能认为这微不足道，但我坦白说，我并不在意您的看法。

"Hmph." Gendo lowered his hands to the desk, uncovering his wide grin. "Despite everything, he still manages to take after me."
哼。" 源堂双手放回桌上，脸上绽开宽厚的笑容。"不管怎样，他终究还是像我。

"But is that a good or bad thing, considering what's yet to come?"
然而，鉴于未来尚不可知的情况，这究竟是福是祸？

"We shall see." 我们会看到的。

"...Do you think we should have told him?"
...你觉得我们是不是应该告诉他？

"That is unnecessary. He will very shortly find out anyway."
这没必要。他很快就会知道了。

Something seemed different about Misato when Shinji left his father's office. She was acting rather more shiftily, not looking directly at him anymore. Was she distracted by something?
真嗣离开父亲办公室时，美里似乎有些异样。她举止更显躲闪，不再直视他，像是被什么事情分了心。

"Come along, let's get back to your room for now. The docs want to keep you under observation for a bit, considering what keeps happening with you and the Evas," she said before setting off. Shinji hurried to catch up, wondering why she was walking so fast. After a minute or two, she asked, "Sooo... what did the Commander say?"
走吧，我们先回你房间。鉴于你和 Eva 之间屡次发生的情况，医生们打算暂时对你进行观察，"她边说边走。真嗣快步跟上，心中疑惑她为何步伐如此匆忙。片刻后，她问道："对了...指挥官有什么指示吗？

"I'm on probation until further notice," Shinji replied. "Whatever that means."
我目前处于缓刑期，直到有新的通知，" 真嗣回答说。"虽然我不太清楚具体含义。

"Ah. Well then just keep your head down and don't pull any more stupid stunts, and you should be fine."
啊，那你就低调行事，别再做出任何愚蠢的举动，应该就没事了。

The rest of the journey was made in tense, awkward silence until finally they came to a stop outside a hospital room door. Misato unlocked Shinji's handcuffs and shoved them in a pocket, before nodding at him and walking off. Shinji watched her until she turned a corner, rubbing his wrists where the cuffs had sat, before sighing and entering the room. He immediately stopped. Someone had come in here and moved things around; the furniture was not where he remembered it, and the privacy curtain had been drawn around the bed.
接下来的路程在一种紧张且尴尬的沉默中度过，直到他们最终停在一间病房门前。Misato 解开 Shinji 的手铐，将其塞进口袋，然后向他点头示意后离去。Shinji 目送她直到她消失在转角，揉了揉手腕上被手铐勒出的红印，叹了口气，推门进入房间。他一进门就愣住了。显然有人进来过，房间里的布置与他记忆中的大相径庭，床边的隐私帘也被拉上了。

Shinji stared at the room, trying to make sense of it all, before realising how futile that was. This was NERV, a place that deployed giant bio-mechanical behemoths to fight aliens. Things stopped making sense the moment he came to Tokyo-3. With a full-body sigh, Shinji ambled over to the bed and grabbed the curtain. When was the last time he'd had a nice, normal day?
真嗣凝视着房间，试图理清思绪，旋即明白这不过是徒劳。此处乃是 NERV，一个动用巨型生物机械巨兽对抗外星入侵的组织。自从踏足第三新东京市，一切便失去了常理。真嗣深深叹息，拖着沉重的步伐走向床铺，伸手拉住窗帘。他已多久未曾享受过那平凡而宁静的一天了呢？

He pushed the curtain aside, and saw the absolute last thing he expected to see.
他拨开窗帘，映入眼帘的竟是他万万没想到的一幕。

"What took you so long?"
你怎么这么久才来？

Brilliant red hair and shining blue eyes were the first things to register in Shinji's mind; the spoken words came an eternity later.
真嗣首先注意到的是那头亮丽的红发和闪耀的蓝眼睛，而话语似乎过了许久才传入耳中。

"A-A-A... Asuka?!" 啊...啊...啊... 明日香?!

Asuka, for that was indeed somehow who it was, huffed and folded her arms, shooting him a look of irritation. "Of course it's me! Who were you expecting, Hikari?"
明日香，正是她本人，不满地哼了一声，双臂交叉，向他投去一个不悦的眼神。“当然是我！你以为是谁，光？”

"But... I... you..." Shinji's brain was completely stalled. Had NERV managed a last-second miracle and rescued her from Unit-02 while he'd been asleep? Wouldn't they have told him?
"可是...我...你..." 真嗣的思绪彻底停滞了。难道是 NERV 在最后关头奇迹般地从二号机中救出了她，而他在睡梦中对此一无所知？他们难道不会通知他吗？

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him, her expression morphing to one of amusement. "Oh, I see. Misato decided to play a little prank of sorts on you." She reached out and gently slapped the back of his head. "Get a hold of yourself. I'm really here, I've apparently spent two weeks trapped inside Unit-02, and it's all thanks to you that I'm back now."
明日香朝他挑了挑眉，脸上露出戏谑的笑容。"哦，我懂了。美里这是给你来了个小恶作剧。"她伸手轻拍了一下他的后脑勺。"清醒点。我确实在这里，我在二号机里被困了两周，多亏有你，我才能回来。"

Shinji's face creased up in confusion. "Wait... I rescued you?! But... how? The last thing I remember is falling asleep in the entry plug after... um..." His face immediately turned bright red.
真嗣一脸困惑，眉头紧锁。“等等...我救了你？！可这怎么可能？我只记得在插入栓里睡着了，之后...呃...”他顿时满脸通红。

"After what...?" Asuka prompted, before turning a suspicious glare on him. "You didn't do anything... weird in my Eva did you?"
到底是什么之后...？" 明日香追问着，目光中带着怀疑转向他。"你没在我的 Eva 里搞什么奇怪的吧？

"N-no! Of course not!" Shinji hurriedly replied. "I just... erm... kinda... talked to you a bit..."
不不！当然不是的！" 真嗣急忙回应道，"我只是...呃...稍微...和你聊了聊...

Asuka blinked at him, slowly bringing up her knees under the bedsheets and wrapping her arms around them. "Talked, huh? Well... considering what...um... things have been like between us recently, I'm pretty sure I can hazard a guess at what you said." Her own face was starting to pink up as well. "A-and... I'm really not sure what to think right now. I know it's not what you want to hear, but I hope you can give me some time to get my head screwed back on properly."
明日香眨着眼望向他，慢慢在被单下屈起膝盖，双臂环抱住自己。“谈过了，对吧？嗯……鉴于我们最近的关系……呃……状况，我大概能猜到你说了些什么。”她的脸颊也开始泛红。“而且……我现在真的不知道该怎么想。我知道这不是你想听的，但我希望你能给我点时间，让我好好整理一下思绪。”

"Y-yeah, of course," Shinji stammered. "But... I don't understand how I was the one to rescue you."
嗯，当然了，" 真嗣有些口吃地说。"可是...我搞不懂怎么偏偏是我救了你。

Asuka vaguely waved a hand. "I don't really know either, except... well... I can't recall much of when I was in Unit-02, but I do remember sometimes feeling like... you were there."
明日香含糊地挥了挥手。“我也不太明白，只是……嗯……我在二号机里的记忆很模糊，但我确实记得有时感觉……你似乎就在那里。”

"You could... sense me or something?"
你能感觉到我，或者类似的东西吗？

"Hardly a surprise," Asuka said with a shrug. "Just look at all the other stuff we've managed to do. If I had to guess, you... I dunno... helped me pull myself together?"
这并不意外，" 明日香耸肩说道，"想想我们之前克服的种种困难。我猜，你...或许...帮我重新振作起来了？

"That's actually almost exactly what happened."
那其实几乎就是事情的真相。

"Huh?" Shinji and Asuka both turned to the doorway, where Doctor Akagi had apparently sneaked in while they were talking.
"咦？" 真嗣和明日香同时看向门口，赤木博士似乎在他们交谈时悄悄走了进来。

"We've finally managed to piece together what happened," she said as she approached them, waving her tablet. "And looking back, I'm kicking myself for not realising the solution sooner."
我们终于弄清楚了事情的来龙去脉，"她边说边走向他们，挥舞着手中的平板。"现在回想起来，我真后悔没有早点想到解决办法。

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other, then back at Akagi. "So?" Asuka pressed. "What happened?"
真嗣和明日香交换了一个眼神，随即目光再次投向赤木。“接下来呢？”明日香急切地追问，“到底出了什么事？”

The scientist cleared her throat. "The reason why Asuka was absorbed into Unit-02 was because the two of you reached a combined sync ratio of over four hundred percent. At any point above one hundred percent, the pilot starts to become unable to differentiate between themselves and the Eva."
科学家清了清嗓子解释道：“明日香被二号机同化的原因，在于你们两人的同步率突破了四百个百分点。一旦超过百分之一百，驾驶员便开始难以分辨自我与 Eva 的界限。”

Shinji's brow furrowed as Akagi talked, remembering what Rei had said a while ago about dangerously high synchronisations. "Something similar happened to Rei and Unit-00, didn't it? A safety system malfunction, right?" he asked.
真嗣眉头紧锁，听着赤木的话，脑海中浮现出绫波之前提及的危险高同步率。“绫波和零号机之前不也遇到过类似问题吗？是安全系统出了故障，对吧？”他追问道。

"...Yes," Akagi replied, looking somewhat surprised at his knowledge of that event. "A system failed, and Rei later reported that she felt like she 'was' the Evangelion. As for you two though, well, obviously we disabled the safeties because you needed the extra synchronisation to kill the Angel. But that came with a price." She waved a hand at Asuka. "According to the last solid bit of data we have on you before you got absorbed, you hit two hundred and ninety-nine point nine nine recurring percent."
...是的，" 赤木回答，对他的这一事件知识略显惊讶。"一个系统出了故障，绫波后来报告说她感觉自己'仿佛'就是那台 EVA。至于你们俩，我们显然是禁用了安全措施，因为你们需要更高的同步率来击败使徒。但这是有代价的。" 她向明日香示意。"根据你被吸收前我们掌握的最后可靠数据，你的同步率达到了两百九十九点九九，无限接近三百。

Asuka's eyes shot wide open in pure shock. "I know that what happened was obviously a bad thing but... Mein Gott!"
明日香惊得双眼瞪得溜圆，"我知道那事确实糟糕透顶，但...我的天哪！"

"Don't get used to it," Akagi retorted, swiftly cutting the girl's excitement off. "The safety systems are going back on and staying on. Now then, back to how you returned, if I may? So. You were stuck in Unit-02, unable to escape because you basically were Unit-02. But then, last night, Shinji did something stupid."
别养成这种习惯，"赤木反驳道，迅速打断了女孩的兴奋。"安全系统会重新开启并保持运行。那么，我们回到你如何回来的话题上吧？情况是这样的，你被困在二号机里，无法脱身，因为你几乎与二号机融为一体。但就在昨晚，真嗣做了件傻事。

Shinji flushed at the harsh words. While he did do it without permission, 'stupid' was not how he would describe it.
真嗣听到严厉的话，脸颊泛红。尽管他确实未经许可就行动了，但“愚蠢”这个词并不适合描述他的行为。

"He got into Unit-02's entry plug," Akagi went on, "partially activated it, and began to talk to you. That, combined with this synchronisation the two of you share outside of piloting, turned him into a sort of... beacon for you, Asuka."
他进入了二号机的驾驶舱，"赤木接着说，"部分启动了它，并开始与你对话。这种互动，再加上你们非驾驶状态下的同步，使他成为了你的某种... 指引，明日香。

"A beacon?" Asuka repeated. "You mean as in something for me to lock onto?"
你是说信标吗？" 明日香重复道。"就像那种让我瞄准的目标？

"Precisely," Akagi confirmed, her fingers dancing over her tablet's screen. "His presence and actions gave you a target to focus on; something to make you aware of your own self, to be able to pull away from Unit-02 and become yourself again. According to the plug's data logs, Shinji talked for a while, then fell asleep. A few minutes afterwards... well... take a look for yourselves."
确实如此，" 赤木肯定地说，手指在平板电脑屏幕上灵巧地滑动。"他的出现和行动为你提供了一个焦点；让你意识到自我，从而能够从二号机中脱离，恢复自我。根据插入栓的数据记录，真嗣聊了一会儿，随后便睡着了。几分钟后...嗯...你们自己看吧。

She tapped one last time on her tablet, before turning it around and presenting the screen to the two teenagers. What was shown on the screen would be forever seared into Shinji's mind. There he was, clad in his plugsuit, eyes closed and head slumped to one side, obviously sleeping.
她轻敲了一下平板电脑，随后将其转向两位少年，展示屏幕上的内容。这一幕将永远铭刻在真嗣的心中：他身着驾驶服，双眼闭合，头微微倾斜，显然是睡着了。

And laying directly on top of him was a certain redheaded German girl, most certainly not in a plugsuit. Or anything at all. Fortunately the internal camera had only captured part of her back; the rest of her was mercifully off-screen while her... her br-
一位红发的德国女孩正直接压在他身上，显然未着插入式套装，甚至一丝不挂。所幸，内部摄像头仅拍到了她背部的一角；她的其余部分并未入镜，而她的……胸部以下部分则幸运地未被摄入。

Shinji ripped his gaze away from the screen, his face feeling like he'd just shoved his entire head into Mt. Asama. Unfortunately, this just ended up with him looking directly at Asuka, who seemed to be taking the news about as well as he was; i.e. completely red-faced and looking like she was about to explode from embarrassment.
真嗣移开盯着屏幕的目光，脸上热辣辣的，仿佛刚把头埋进了浅间山的火山口。不巧的是，这一转头正好对上了明日香的视线，她似乎也和他一样，满脸涨得通红，一副羞愤欲绝的模样。

"W-w-w-was zur Hölle?!" 这到底是怎么回事?!

"When you were absorbed," Akagi said without the slightest reaction to the outburst, "your plugsuit was left behind. When you returned, you came back naked and unconscious. I discovered the two of you like that when I entered the cage the next morning. After I contacted someone to get you two out of there, I also did my best to preserve your modesty by putting a towel around you before you were moved here. As far as we can tell, neither of you awoke before coming to the medical wing."
你沉浸其中时，"赤木平静地说，对刚才的激动无动于衷，"你的插入栓服留在了原地。你回来时，是赤裸且昏迷的。第二天早上我进笼子时，就看到你们俩这样。我联系了人把你们转移出来，并尽力维护你们的尊严，用毛巾遮盖后才将你们送到医疗翼。据我们所知，你们俩在到达医疗翼之前都未曾醒来。

That seemed to calm Asuka down a little. Shinji carefully decided not to mention the strange dream he had had just before waking up.
那似乎让明日香稍微平静了些。真嗣小心翼翼地决定不提他醒来前做的那个怪梦。

"Anyway, now that you've been recovered from Unit-02, we need to look the Eva over again to check for any problems. The two of you will just need a check up and you'll be free to leave." Akagi stopped, raising an eyebrow. "...You two aren't having any... weird synchronisation things happening again are you?"
不管怎样，既然你已从二号机中恢复，我们得重新检查一下 Eva，确保一切正常。你们俩只需做个体检，便可自由行动。" 赤木顿了顿，眉头微挑，追问道："...你们俩没再出现什么奇怪的同步问题吧？

Shinji was about to respond, but then he caught Asuka's eye. While her expression didn't give anything away, he knew exactly what she was planning.
真嗣本欲回应，却与明日香的目光不期而遇。虽然她的神情未露端倪，他却已洞悉她的打算。

And he was entirely on board with it.
他对此完全支持。

"No," they said together. "We're not having any problems this time. We feel perfectly normal."
不，"他们齐声说道，"这次我们一切正常，感觉和平时一样。

With a deep sigh, Akagi hung her head. "Yeah, alright, I'll admit I walked right into that one. Only got myself to blame. Hell, this basically convinces me you don't need a checkup." She immediately turned and left the room, shaking her head as she headed into the corridor. "Damn kids..."
深叹一口气，赤城垂下头。“行吧，我承认，这次是我自己撞枪口上了。怪不得别人。这么一来，我倒真觉得你没必要做检查了。”她随即转身走出房间，边摇头边步入走廊，嘴里还嘟囔着：“真是的，这些小鬼……”

The mood sufficiently lightened, Asuka gave Shinji a victorious grin, even as her face kept some of its previous pinkness. "If she's gonna give us an opening like that, we have no choice but to take it!" she crowed.
气氛已然轻松，明日香向真嗣露出胜利的微笑，尽管她的脸颊仍带着些许红晕。“既然她给了我们这样的机会，我们当然要抓住！”她得意洋洋地说。

Shinji chuckled, but before he could reply, the door to the room slid open again and Rei Ayanami stepped in, wearing her plugsuit.
真嗣不禁轻笑，正要开口回应，房门再次开启，绫波丽身着插入栓服步入室内。

"Wondergirl!" Asuka gleefully exclaimed. "Good to see you made it through that shitstorm alright!"
神奇女孩！" 阿苏卡兴奋地叫道，"真高兴看到你从那场混乱中平安无事！

A faint smile graced Rei's face. "It is gratifying to see you alive and well too, Asuka," she replied. "Shinji had been... somewhat worried about you during your absence."
绫波的嘴角微微上扬，露出一抹浅笑。“明日香，看到你平安无事，我也感到很欣慰，”她回应道。“你离开期间，真嗣他……确实有些挂念你。”

"'Somewhat worried'," Asuka repeated. "So what you're saying is he was a complete mess. Honestly, Shinji, you gotta learn to take care of yourself too!"
'有点担心'，" 明日香重复说。"看来他那时真是乱七八糟的。说实话，真嗣，你也要学会照顾自己啊！

Shinji flushed slightly, but she had hit the nail on the head; after all, he'd spent almost the entirety of the past two weeks in Unit-02's cage, barely concerned with anything besides Asuka's recovery.
真嗣脸上泛起红晕，她的话正中要害；过去两周，他几乎全副心思都放在二号机的机库和明日香的康复上，无暇他顾。

"How about Glasses? Haven't seen him yet." Asuka frowned. "And his Eva was getting hijacked, if I remember right."
眼镜那边怎么样了？我还没见到他。" 明日香皱起眉头，"记得没错的话，他的 Eva 那时正遭到劫持。

The smile fled from Rei's face like it was being chased by an Angel. "Kensuke... he..."
绫脸上的笑容瞬间消失，仿佛被天使追赶一般。"健介...他..."

Asuka glanced between Rei and Shinji as both of them remained silent. "...Shit," she cursed. "He's not... dead... is he?"
明日香目光在零和真嗣之间游移，两人都默不作声。"...糟糕，"她低声咒骂。"他该不会...已经..."

"No," Shinji murmured. "But he's... not doing well. Part of the Angel infested his body and he's in quarantine. It's slowly taking over, merging with him, and Doctor Akagi said there's nothing they can do to remove it. They're still trying, but... he's got another two weeks at best before they'll be forced to..."
不，" 真嗣轻声道，"但他状况不佳。使徒的一部分侵入了他的身体，目前他处于隔离状态。那部分正在逐渐与他融合，赤木博士表示无法将其移除。尽管他们仍在努力，但... 他最多只能撑两周，之后他们将别无选择...

"...I see," Asuka replied, eyes downcast. "Damnit. I wish I could say I didn't see this coming, but it's clear we all got caught out. Two Angels attacking at once, one of them hiding in an Eva and taking it over at the worst possible time... It can't be a coincidence." She brought her head up, her gaze hardening. "Considering the enemy we face, we should consider ourselves lucky that the three of us are still healthy."
...我明白了，" 明日香低声回应，眼神黯淡。"真是的。我真希望我能说这一切出乎意料，但显然我们都大意了。两个使徒同时来袭，其中一个潜伏在 Eva 内部，在最不利的时刻夺取了控制...这绝非偶然。" 她抬起头，目光坚定。"面对这样的敌人，我们三个还能安然无恙，已经算是幸运了。

Rei nodded resolutely. "It is greatly distressing what Kensuke is suffering through, but we must not let it shake our resolve. The duty of an Eva pilot is to face the Angels in battle and destroy them. We are the only ones capable of this; without us, humanity is doomed to annihilation."
绫坚定地点了点头：“真嗣的遭遇确实令人心痛，但我们绝不能因此失去决心。作为 Eva 驾驶员，我们的使命就是在战斗中迎战使徒并将其消灭。我们是唯一能承担此重任的人；没有我们，人类将面临灭顶之灾。”

"Exactly!" said Asuka, slapping a fist into a palm. "We must press on! We can't let his sacrifice be in vain! As soon as everything's settled down, I want us all in the simulators. We've been slacking off for two weeks, after all, and we have to keep ourselves sharp if we want to avoid anything like this in the future!"
没错！" 阿苏卡说着，一拳击在掌心。"我们得继续前进，绝不能让他的牺牲白费！一旦情况稳定，大家都给我进模拟器去。我们已经松懈了两周，要想避免将来再出这种事，就得时刻保持警觉！

"I look forward to it," replied Rei. "Shinji and I have not left the Geofront ever since the attack. It has become rather... dull around here."
我很期待，" 丽回应说。"自从那次袭击后，我和真嗣就没离开过 Geofront。这里变得相当... 无聊。

"Well, at this point we should be allowed to leave now, right?" asked Shinji. "I mean... apart from Kensuke, we're all fine and there's no more need for us to remain constantly on duty, is there?"
嗯，现在这个阶段，我们是不是可以撤了？" 碇真嗣问道。"我是说...除了健介，大家都没事，没必要再一直守着了，对吧？

The door opened once more; this time it was Misato entering and interrupting the conversation. "What's this I'm hearing about duty?" she boisterously asked.
门又一次开启，美里走了进来，打断了大家的谈话。她大声问道：“我听到你们在谈论职责，是怎么回事？”

"We're asking if we can go back home yet," Asuka clarified.
"我们问现在能不能回家，"飞鸟解释说。

"Oh. That. Well, I think I saw Ritsuko talking with one of the doctors. Chances are they'll be along shortly." Misato paused, apparently seeing the scowl that was darkening Shinji's face. "...Is something wrong, Shinji?"
哦，你说那个啊。我记得看到律子跟一位医生在谈话，估计他们一会儿就到了。" 三笠顿了顿，察觉到真嗣脸色不悦。"...真嗣，有什么不对劲吗？

"Hmph." He folded his arms. "Asuka was recovered, and you never bothered to tell me. Until I came into this room, I was expecting Unit-02 to have already been put away!"
哼。" 他双臂交叉，不满地说："明日香已经安全返回，你却一直没告诉我。直到我踏进这房间，我还以为二号机早就被妥善安置了！

Misato shrugged. "Uh... sorry. I kinda wanted it to be a surprise. And honestly, I was expecting the Commander to tell you. But when you came out of his office still looking like a kicked puppy... well I thought about just telling you outright but..."
美里耸了耸肩。“呃……不好意思，我原本是想给你个惊喜的。说实话，我以为指挥官会跟你说的。可你从他办公室出来时，还是一副垂头丧气的样子……我本想直接告诉你，但又觉得……”

Shinji sighed. "Yeah, I know how much you love surprises."
真嗣叹息道：“嗯，我明白你有多爱惊喜。”

"Exactly! Now then... Asuka, your clothes are waiting for you in the bathroom." Misato turned to Rei. "You've apparently already been cleared, but I'm assuming you're going to wait for Asuka and Shinji?"
没错！那么... 明日香，你的换洗衣物已放在浴室了。" 碇真嗣转头对绫波丽说，"你似乎已经准备妥当，不过我想你会等明日香和真嗣一起吧？

"Correct," was Rei's simple reply.
"正确，"Rei 简单地回答道。

"Thought so. Well I'll go find somebody and tell them to hurry the hell up, and hopefully we'll be out of here within the hour. Finally!" The last word was practically a shout, startling the three teenagers as Misato threw her arms up. "I just want to go home, have a nice cold beer, and fall asleep in my own damn bed!"
果然不出所料。我这就去找人催促他们加快速度，希望我们能在一小时内离开这里。终于！" Misato 最后一句几乎是喊出来的，吓了三个青少年一跳，她举起双臂。"我只想回家，喝杯冰啤酒，然后舒舒服服地睡在自己的床上！

Judging by the expressions on his fellow pilot's faces, Shinji knew the feeling was mutual.
从同伴飞行员脸上的表情判断，真嗣明白这种感觉是彼此共有的。

XXX

As it turned out, while the pilots were cleared to go home Misato received a phone call that made her groan loudly about an officer meeting. She told the pilots that it was up to them whether they wanted to wait around for her, which would probably take a couple hours, or just head home themselves.
原来，虽然飞行员们被允许回家，但葛城美里接到一个电话，让她对即将召开的军官会议大声叹息。她告诉飞行员们，他们可以选择等她，这可能要花上几个小时，或者直接回家。

After their guardian stomped off, Asuka expressed a desire to check in on Kensuke so Shinji did his best to lead them to the quarantine chamber, only taking a wrong turn once before they ended up in front of the airlock door.
监护人离开后，明日香提出想探望健介，真嗣便努力带路前往隔离室，途中虽误入歧途一次，但最终还是抵达了气闸门前。

"If you don't mind, I'll just... stay out here," said Shinji with a shudder.
"如果你不介意，我就……在外面待着吧，" 真嗣颤抖着说道。

"I will remain here as well," added Rei, staring at the door.
"我也会留在这里，" 蕾伊说着，目光紧盯着门。

Asuka glanced at both of them, before shrugging and turning to the intercom next to the door.
明日香瞥了他们两人一眼，随后耸耸肩，转身面向门旁的对讲机。

"Pilot Soryu here to see Pilot Aida," she said into the intercom.
"我是飞行员 Soryu，前来见飞行员 Aida，"她通过对讲机说道。

A few seconds passed, then a voice responded. "Oh. Uh... One moment please?" Asuka huffed and impatiently tapped her foot as a minute dragged slowly past before the voice came back. "Okay, Doctor Akagi says you can come in."
片刻后，一个声音回应：“哦，呃……请稍等。”明日香不耐烦地哼了一声，脚尖轻敲地面，等待着。一分钟后，声音再次传来：“好了，赤木博士让你进来。”

After a quick glance at Rei and Shinji to see if they'd changed their minds, Asuka stepped through the door alone and into the antechamber. As the airlock cycled, she was reminded of the hideously embarrassing decontamination process she'd had to nakedly endure not so long ago.
匆匆看了看绫波和真嗣，确认他们是否改变了主意后，明日香独自穿门而入，踏进了前厅。随着气闸门的关闭，她不禁回想起不久前那段令人难堪至极的裸体消毒经历。

The inner door opened, and Asuka entered the room beyond. The first thing she noticed was a white-haired young man in standard NERV-issue beige leaning back in a chair facing away from her, feet up on the terminal in front of him and a book in one hand.
内门缓缓开启，明日香步入内室。映入眼帘的是一位白发青年，身着 NERV 标配的米色制服，背向她而坐，椅子后仰，双脚搭在面前的终端上，手中还翻阅着一本书。

"Hello, Pilot Soryu," he said, not taking his eyes off the book. His free hand pointed towards the right of the room. "Pilot Aida is just on the other side of that window. Afraid I can't let you in there though. If you want to see how he's doing, I can show you on this screen."
你好，Soryu 飞行员，"他边说边盯着书本，用空着的手指向房间的右侧。"Aida 飞行员就在那扇窗的另一侧。很抱歉，我不能让你进去。但如果你想看看他的状况，我可以在这屏幕上给你展示。

Asuka pulled her eyes away from the back of his head. It was a bit of an odd choice for a hair colour, but then she considered what Rei looked like. "Yeah, sure," she said after a moment, looking through the window at the coffin-like object.
明日香把视线从他的后脑勺上移开。这种发色确实挺特别的，不过她随即想到了绫波的样子。"嗯，好吧，"她顿了一下说道，目光透过窗户落在那个形似棺材的物体上。

The book suddenly snapped shut, the feet came off the terminal and down to the ground, and the young man began typing at his keyboard. The screen changed, and Asuka gritted her teeth in disgust at the sight it showed. Apparently not content with simply taking over an Evangelion, whatever was left of the Angel seemed to be absorbing her fellow pilot as well.
书本猛地合上，双脚从终端上挪开，踏到地面，年轻人随即在键盘上敲打起来。屏幕上的画面一变，明日香见状，不禁厌恶地咬紧了牙关。看来，那残存的使徒不仅控制了福音战士，似乎还在吞噬她的另一位驾驶员同伴。

"Nothing NERV's tried has worked yet," the young man apologetically reported with a shrug. "Less than two weeks before he'll be so far gone that they'll just... give him mercy, so to speak."
NERV 迄今尝试的方法无一见效，"年轻人略带歉意地报告，同时耸了耸肩。"再过不到两周，他就会病入膏肓，到那时，他们恐怕只能...给予他所谓的'安乐'了。

"Verdammte," Asuka growled under her breath.
"该死的，" 明日香咬牙切齿地低声说道。

"Ja, er tut mir irgendwie leid. Wünschte, ich könnte ihm helfen, anstatt einfach nur hier zu sitzen und ihm langsam beim Sterben zuzusehen."[Yeah, I feel kinda sorry for him. Wish I could help him, instead of sitting here and watching him slowly die.]
确实，我对他心生怜悯。真希望我能伸出援手，而不是坐视不理，看着他逐渐走向生命的尽头。

Asuka absently nodded. "Ja," she mumbled, before realisation set in. "Wait, you speak German?!"
明日香心不在焉地点头应了一声：“嗯。”随后她突然意识到什么，惊讶地问：“等等，你会说德语？！”

The young man half turned his head towards her. "I was originally working at NERV Hamburg before recently getting transferred here along with a couple others."
年轻人侧过头，面向她说：“我之前在 NERV 汉堡工作，最近才和几位同事一同调来此处。”

Asuka huffed. "I was about to say, I'm pretty sure I would have recognised that hair if you'd been at the Berlin base."
明日香不满地哼了一声。“我刚想说，你要是在柏林基地，我肯定能认出你那头发。”

"I'll admit it does stand out among a sea of black and brown." He shrugged. "Nobody seems to mind one way or the other about it though."
我得承认，在一片黑棕色中，它确实很突出。" 他耸耸肩，"不过，好像也没人在意这一点。

"After seeing me and the First Child, they're probably used to it by now."
看到我和第一个孩子后，他们现在大概已经习以为常了。

A slight tilt of the head. "Perhaps. Anyway, do you have any other business? Afraid there isn't much to do here."
头微微一歪。“可能吧。话说回来，你还有别的事吗？这里确实没什么事可做。”

Asuka shook her head. "Nah, I just wanted to see how he was doing for myself. Thanks."
明日香摇摇头说：“不，我只是想亲自确认一下他的情况。谢谢。”

"Not a problem. I'll let you out now. Have a good day."
没问题。我现在就放你出去。祝你今天过得愉快。

"Yeah, you too." 你也是，对吧。

As she walked back to the airlock, Asuka caught a glimpse of the young man's face as the screen they'd been looking at went blank. It might have just been her imagination, but something made it seem like he had red eyes. She shook the thought out of her head. Just because she knew one person with odd hair and red eyes didn't mean someone else was the same.
当她返回气闸时，明日香恰好看到屏幕变暗前那年轻人的脸。或许是她多心，但那一刻，他的眼睛似乎泛着红光。她摇了摇头，试图摆脱这个念头。毕竟，她认识的那个有着异样发色和红眼的人，并不代表其他人也会如此。

XXX

The sudden hiss of the door opening almost made Shinji jump out of his skin. Asuka stepped out into the corridor, giving him a sympathetic look. For some reason, Rei's eyes had been locked onto some point inside the quarantine chamber ever since Asuka had gone in. Shinji had considered bringing it up, but in the end he just assumed she was 'looking' at Kensuke.
门突然打开的嘶嘶声差点让真嗣吓得跳起来。明日香走出走廊，同情地看了他一眼。不知为何，自从明日香进入隔离室后，绫波的目光就一直紧盯着室内的某一点。真嗣本想提及此事，但最终他只是认为绫波在“注视”着健介。

And wondered just what exactly she could 'see'.
她不禁好奇，自己究竟能看到些什么。

While Shinji wanted to just head home, Asuka had the idea of heading out to the Geofront's 'outdoor' area to see what it looked like after their titanic battle. Rei winced at the mention of the battle but tried to remain stoic; seeing this, Asuka made an effort to tone down her enthusiasm somewhat.
虽然真嗣打算直接回家，明日香却提议去 Geofront 的户外区域，想看看他们那场大战后的样子。提到战斗，零不禁皱眉，却尽力保持平静；注意到这一点，明日香便稍稍抑制了自己的兴奋情绪。

The Geofront looked a lot different when they were at ground level than it did from of dozens of metres higher in an Evangelion. The domed ceiling high above their heads, complete with what was essentially an inverted city hanging from said ceiling, was somewhat awe-inspiring. None of the pilots, not even Rei, knew how to actually go about reaching those buildings. Shinji had heard talk of there being a restaurant in one of them.
当他们身处地表，与在数十米高空的初号机中俯瞰相比，第三新东京市的地下都市风貌迥异。头顶高悬的穹顶，以及悬挂其上的倒置城市，令人叹为观止。即便是经验丰富的驾驶员绫波丽，也无人知晓如何抵达那些建筑。真嗣曾耳闻其中一座建筑内设有餐厅。

They wandered along the side of a service road that went past the Geofront's lake, Asuka occasionally pointing out a giant footprint or other fresh blemish on the once-pristine landscape. Shinji was more interested in the destroyer sitting in the middle of the lake. The last time he had seen it, all the pilots had been ejected from the disastrous simulation body test and left to their own devices for hours. He still didn't know how the ship had actually gotten down here, and made a mental note to try and ask Misato about it later.
他们沿着一条穿过 Geofront 湖泊的服务路漫步。明日香不时指向巨大的脚印或其他新近的瑕疵，这些瑕疵玷污了曾经纯净的风景。真嗣的目光更多地停留在湖中央的驱逐舰上。上次他见到它时，所有飞行员都在一次失败的模拟体测试中被弹射出来，孤立无援地度过了数小时。他依然不清楚这艘船是如何抵达此地的，心中暗暗决定稍后要向美里询问。

A wooden shack in the distance, set well away from the road, caught Shinji's eye and he pointed it out to the others. It caught Asuka's curiosity; she peered at it, then leaned forward with narrowed eyes, which suddenly widened in surprise.
远处一座远离道路的木屋吸引了真嗣的目光，他随即指给其他人看。这勾起了明日香的好奇心，她凝视着那木屋，眯起眼睛向前探身，突然间惊讶地睁大了双眼。

"Kaji?!" she exclaimed, glancing at Shinji and Rei in surprise before sprinting off, leaving them to give each other a look of confusion as they took off in pursuit.
"加持先生？！" 她惊讶地叫出声，目光在真嗣和丽之间一扫而过，随即拔腿就跑，留下两人面露疑惑，紧随其后追赶。

Indeed, as they got closer they could make out the scruffy man kneeling on the ground doing... something. It was only when Shinji came right up behind Kaji that he could see yet another mark of the battle against the two Angels. A piece of ground, ripped up with chunks of... watermelons? scattered about the area or smashed into the dirt. Shinji's stomach quietly grumbled in dismay at the ruined food.
确实，随着他们逐渐接近，一个衣衫褴褛的男子跪在地上忙碌的身影映入眼帘。直到真嗣紧随加治身后，才注意到这片土地上，与两位天使激战后的又一伤痕：地面被撕裂，西瓜块四处散落，有的甚至碎裂入土。目睹食物被毁，真嗣的肚子不禁发出不满的咕噜声。

"Heya, kids," Kaji greeted with a weary sigh, getting to his feet and brushing dust off his knees. "Just got back into town after a few jobs elsewhere. Came to check how my little farm was doing, and... well..."
嘿，孩子们，" 卡吉疲惫地叹了口气，站起身来，拍了拍膝盖上的尘土。"刚从外面做完几份工作回到镇上。顺道来看看我的小农场，结果……嗯……

"I didn't even know you had a farm," Asuka remarked.
"我竟然不知道你还有个农场，" 明日香说道。

"It's just something I do to unwind," Kaji replied. "I was hoping to harvest a few for New Years Day."
我这么做只是为了放松，" 卡吉回答说。"想在新年那天收获一些。

"Sorry, Mr. Kaji," Shinji murmured, upon realising just what had destroyed the little farm: an Evangelion's foot.
"抱歉，卡吉先生，" 碇真嗣低声说道，意识到摧毁小农场的元凶：竟是一台福音战士的脚。

Kaji waved a dismissive hand. "Aaah, don't apologise, kiddo. Saving the world's more important than some melons. I can always just plant some seeds and start again. Can't say the same if an Angel gets the better of you." He glanced at Asuka.
加治摆摆手，不以为意地说：“哎呀，别道歉了，孩子。拯救世界比几个西瓜重要多了。我随时能再种，但你要是被天使打败了，那可就麻烦了。”他瞥了明日香一眼。

"Is that what you are doing now?" asked Rei. "Would you like some assistance?"
你现在做的是这个吗？" 丽问道。"需要帮忙吗？

Kaji's eyes flicked over to her. "Sure, if you're all happy to lend a hand, I'd appreciate the help." He pointed towards the shack. "There's some tools in there, we'll start by tilling the soil. May as well leave what's left of the melons, they're nothing but compost now anyway."
加治的目光转向她，说道：“当然，如果大家乐意帮忙，我非常感激。”他指向小屋，补充道：“那里有工具，我们先翻土。至于剩下的西瓜，就别管了，它们现在只能当肥料了。”

The teenagers got to work under the instruction of Kaji. What had seemed at first glance to be a big task flew by and only an hour or two later, they were already planting the last of the new seeds. Rei seemed to have cheered up some as well, focusing intently on each seed as she pushed it into the ground then covered it with soil.
在 Kaji 的指导下，青少年们迅速投入工作。原本看似繁重的任务转眼间就完成了，不出一两个小时，他们已在种植最后一批新种子。Rei 的心情似乎也有所好转，她全神贯注地将每一粒种子埋入土中，并细心地覆盖上土壤。

Asuka wiped a hand across her brow. "Phew, that's done. Watering cans, next?"
明日香用手抹了把额头上的汗。“呼，总算搞定了。接下来该浇花壶了吧？”

Kaji nodded. "Yep. Well... first we need to fill them up, and there's no pump here."
加治点头说：“对。首先得把它们装满，可这里没有泵。”

Asuka slowly turned to look at the lake; it could only be called 'nearby' in the relative sense. It would take several minutes to walk there and back, and there were only two watering cans. Shinji frowned at the lake, then had a thought and glanced around the Geofront.
明日香缓缓转头望向那片湖，严格来说，它只能算作“附近”。走过去再回来得花上好几分钟，手头仅有两个浇水壶。真嗣对着湖皱眉思索，忽然灵光一闪，开始环视地下都市。

"Hang on," he said after a moment. "All the trees and stuff are real down here, right?"
稍等，"他顿了一下说，"这里的树和周围的东西都是真的吧？

"Well... yeah," Asuka replied. "What'd be the point of planting tons of fake trees down here?"
嗯...确实，" 明日香回应说。"在这里种这么多假树，意义何在呢？

"So then..." Shinji looked down at his feet, then up at the Geofront's ceiling hundreds of metres above their heads. "How does everything down here get water? Are you going to tell me there's a network of sprinklers in the ground, or something up there to create rain?"
那么..." 碇真嗣低头看了看自己的脚，随后抬头望向头顶数百米高的第三新东京市地下都市的天花板。"这里的水源是如何解决的？难道地下有喷灌系统，或者上面有装置能模拟降雨吗？

Asuka opened her mouth to respond, then quickly shut it with a click of her teeth. She looked at Rei, who could only tilt her head in response to the unasked question.
明日香刚要开口回答，却又立刻闭上，牙齿轻轻一碰。她望向绫波，对方只是歪着头，对这未言明的问题作出回应。

"I think it's best not to think too hard about it, Shinji," Kaji remarked. "I mean, I thought I knew how that destroyer on the lake got down here, but I've now heard everything from it being built on-site to a top-secret portal system powered by psychics that requires going through Hell."
我觉得还是别太深究这件事为好，真嗣，" 薰评论道。"我原以为自己清楚湖上那艘驱逐舰是如何运到这里的，但现在听到的说法千奇百怪，有说是现场建造的，也有说是通过一个由通灵者驱动的绝密传送门系统，甚至得穿越地狱才能到达。

Shinji stared at the ceiling for a moment longer, then sighed and picked up one of the watering cans.
真嗣凝视天花板片刻，轻叹一声，随即拿起一只喷水壶。

NERV was such a strange place.
NERV 这个地方真是奇异。

Half an hour later, Kaji put the last of the tools back in the shack and closed the door. "Thanks for the help, kids. I really appreciate it."
半小时后，卡吉将最后一件工具放回棚屋，关上门。“孩子们，感谢你们的帮忙，我非常感激。”

"After everything that's happened to us recently," said Asuka, "I think we kinda needed a bit of... normality."
经历了最近发生的这一切，" 阿苏卡说道，"我想我们确实需要一点... 正常生活的滋味。

"Heh, well, I'm glad to have helped in that respect." Kaji ran a hand through his hair, gazing fondly at the little patch of farmland, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a battered packet of cigarettes and a lighter. After lighting one, he took a deep drag and exhaled, smoke billowing out of his mouth. "Can I... ask a favour of you, kids?"
呵呵，能在这方面帮上忙，我很高兴。" 卡吉捋了捋头发，目光温柔地落在那片小农田上，随后从口袋里摸出一包磨损的香烟和打火机。点燃香烟，深吸一口后缓缓吐出烟雾。"孩子们，能麻烦你们帮个忙吗？

"Huh?" Shinji turned to face the man. "What is it, Kaji?"
嗯？" 真嗣转向那个男人。"什么事，薰？

Kaji took another drag. "Would you mind taking a bit of time occasionally to come down here and check on our little project? I'm... gonna be rather busy in the coming weeks and I might not have the chance to regularly maintain this patch."
加治再次深吸一口烟，说道：“你能否偶尔抽空来这儿，关照一下我们的小项目？我接下来几周事务繁多，恐怕难以定期打理这片地方。”

"I would be glad to assist," said Rei.
"我很高兴能提供帮助，"雷说道。

Asuka piped up. "Yeah, us too, right Shinji?"
明日香突然开口：“对啊，我们也是吧，真嗣？”

Shinji nodded, and Kaji grinned at the trio. "Thanks. And if I'm not around when they're ready to harvest, go right ahead and help yourselves."
碇真嗣点头示意，加持良治对三人露出笑容。“多谢了。要是收获时我不在场，你们就自己动手吧。”

The three teenagers agreed, but Shinji felt like there was something... odd in the way Kaji had started speaking. Like he was sure he'd be gone for a very long time.
三位少年虽然同意了，但真嗣感到加治的语气有些异样，仿佛他预感到自己将长时间离开。

At that moment Shinji's phone began to ring, so he brought it out and answered it.
就在那一刻，真嗣的手机铃声响起，他随即取出手机接听。

"Hi Shinji," said a tired-sounding Misato. "Meeting's done. You guys gone home yet?"
嗨，真嗣，" 美里带着疲惫的声音说道，"会议结束了。你们已经回家了吗？

"Hello Misato," he said back, noticing that the others perked up at the mention of her name. "No, we decided to go for a walk around the Geofront. Where do you want us to meet you?"
你好，美里，"他回答道，注意到其他人一听到她的名字就精神一振。"我们决定去 Geofront 周围散散步。你想我们在哪儿碰头？

"Depends. Want to come to the parking lot or do you want me to drive out there and pick you up?"
看你的意思。你是想来停车场，还是我开车去接你？

"It'd probably be quicker if you came to get us. We're near the-" He glanced at Kaji and questioningly mouthed the word 'east?', getting a nod in response. "-east side of the lake. There's a wooden shack you can see from the road, where we've been helping Kaji plant some melons."
你们过来接我们或许更快。我们在湖东侧，从路上能看见一个木屋，我们正帮卡吉在那儿种西瓜。

"...Kaji's there?" was Misato's surprised response, followed by what sounded like her clearing her throat. "Yeah, alright, I'll come get you. Wouldn't mind a... chat with him anyway. See you soon!"
加治真的在那儿吗？"美里惊讶地回应道，随后传来她清嗓子的声音。"行，我马上过来。正好也想和他聊聊...一会儿见！

Putting the phone away, Shinji relayed the info to the others. While Asuka and Rei simply accepted the news, Kaji smirked and rubbed his chin, creating a rasping sound. With nothing to do but wait for Misato to arrive, Asuka began to chat with Kaji. Shinji, noticing Rei had wandered off a little, decided to go that way too, soon coming up beside her as she stared across the lake.
真嗣放下手机，将信息转告给了其他人。明日香和绫波对此消息只是简单接受，而加持则微微一笑，摩挲着下巴，发出细微的摩擦声。既然只能等待美里到来，明日香便开始与加持聊天。真嗣注意到绫波已经稍稍走远，便也向那边走去，很快便来到她身旁，她正静静地望着湖面。

"Are you alright, Rei?" he tentatively asked.
"你还好吗，零？"他小心翼翼地问道。

Rei didn't respond for a little while; when she did, it was with a small sigh as she closed her eyes. "I... am still not sure how to feel about what I did."
蕾沉默了片刻，最终轻叹一声，闭上双眼说道：“我……依然无法确定自己对所做之事的感觉。”

"What you did... oh." Shinji mentally slapped himself for forgetting. "Well... I really don't know how accurate it might be, but would you like to hear what I think?"
你刚才的举动...哎呀。" 真嗣暗自责备自己竟然忘了这事。"说实话，我也不确定这有多准确，不过你想听听我的看法吗？

Turning an inquisitive look on him, Rei gave a tiny, hesitant nod.
好奇地打量着他，Rei 略带迟疑地点了点头。

He took a deep breath. "Alright. So, the Angel took over the Evangelion and invaded the entry plug as well. At that point, Kensuke was already unconscious, and for all we knew at the time he could have been... dead. But for some reason, the Angel wanted that entry plug back after you managed to... well... steal it. You ended up kind of tricking the Angel by distracting it with the entry plug and landed the killing blow."
他深吸一口气。“那么，天使控制了福音战士，连同插入栓也被侵占了。当时，剑介已经不省人事，我们都以为他可能已经……丧命。但不知为何，天使在你设法夺回插入栓后，又想将其夺回。你巧妙地用插入栓分散了天使的注意力，从而成功施以致命一击。”

It was hard to watch Rei's face as he recounted the events in question. She was normally incredibly stoic even in the heat of battle, but right now she looked like she was about to cry. "Y... yes," she eventually said quietly. "That is how things unfolded."
看着零叙述那些事件时的表情，实在让人心疼。她平日里即便在战斗最激烈时也异常镇定，此刻却仿佛快要落泪。“是...是的，”她最终轻声确认，“事情就是这样发生的。”

"And you feel guilty for using Kensuke as bait, even if it was to stop something as dangerous as an Angel."
你为将健介当作诱饵而感到内疚，尽管这是为了阻止像天使这样的危险存在。

A small nod. 微微点头。

"In my... admittedly uneducated opinion, knowing what Kensuke is like..." Shinji paused, hoping that he wasn't about to say the most amazingly wrong thing possible. "...I think he would have cheered you on for such a tactic."
在我... 尽管见识有限，但根据我对剑介的了解..." 真嗣顿了顿，暗自祈祷自己不会说出什么荒谬至极的话。"...我认为他肯定会支持你采取这样的策略。

The effect was stunning. In the blink of an eye, Rei went from looking downcast and guilty to surprised and... rather angry. "You think he would have welcomed that?!"
效果惊人。转眼间，Rei 从一脸沮丧和内疚变成了惊讶，甚至...相当愤怒。"你以为他会乐意接受吗?!"

"I do admit it's just a theory," Shinji hastily said, raising his hands in a placating gesture. "But remember what he's like. Kensuke's a military fanatic. He basically raised himself on the culture. This is a guy who, when he's out camping, conducts war games by himself. He's practically the son of a soldier without even being related to one."
我确实承认这只是一种理论，" 真嗣急忙说道，举起双手以示安抚。"但别忘了健介的个性。他是个彻头彻尾的军事迷。几乎是在军事文化中自我成长的。这个人，露营时会独自模拟战争游戏。他虽非军人之子，却有着军人般的气质。

"...By himself...?" ...自己一个人...？

Shinji couldn't resist the small chuckle as Rei became the latest to be confused by Kensuke's mindset. "Yeah. He knew what he was getting into when NERV approached him to become a pilot, and he accepted the risks. I'm sure that if it came down to it, he'd sacrifice himself to protect one of us without a second thought." Shinji paused again, locking his eyes on Rei. "Does that sound familiar to you?"
真嗣忍不住轻笑，因为绫波丽也成了被健介的心态搞糊涂的最新一人。"没错。他清楚 NERV 招募他当驾驶员意味着什么，也接受了这些风险。我相信，真到了紧要关头，他会毫不犹豫地牺牲自己来保护我们中的任何一个。"真嗣再次停顿，目光紧紧盯着绫波丽。"这话对你来说耳熟吗？"

"...Yes," Rei murmured after a long silence. "But at the same time, I'm sure you would do the same too. And Asuka."
...嗯，" 丽在长久的沉默后轻声说道，"但我也相信，你和明日香也会这么做。

"True," Shinji conceded, running a hand through his hair. "Look, the point I'm trying to make is that our job is an insanely dangerous one, but we do it anyway because we're the only ones who can. I think that Kensuke wouldn't hold it against you that you used him to help you kill the Angel. Are you willing to accept that you have nothing to feel guilty about?"
确实如此，" 碇真嗣边说边用手梳理着头发。"我想强调的是，我们的任务异常危险，但我们依然承担，因为非我们莫属。我相信，洞木光不会因为你借助他来消灭使徒而对你有所怨言。你能接受自己其实无需感到内疚吗？

Rei sighed, casting her gaze back across the lake. "I... will try."
绫叹了口气，目光再次掠过湖面，轻声道：“我……会尽力一试。”

"There is no try," Shinji replied. At Rei's puzzled frown, he added, "It's... something Asuka said to me a while ago. I think she was referencing something but I'm not sure what."
没有所谓的尝试，" 真嗣回答道。见绫波一脸困惑，他接着解释，"这是……之前明日香对我说的一句话。我猜她是在引用某个典故，但具体是什么我不太清楚。

"I... see... Oh." She pointed out to a spot near the lake. "I believe that is Misato's vehicle."
我...看到了...哦。"她指向湖畔附近，"那应该是美里小姐的车。

If there was any doubt in Shinji's mind about the identity of the driver, it died in a hit-and-run as the car veered off the road and came barrelling right towards them. Just as it seemed like it wouldn't stop, the car suddenly braked into a spin, halting with its rear bumper just centimetres shy of Kaji's legs and spraying dirt and grass everywhere.
如果真嗣对司机的身份还有一丝疑虑，那么在一宗肇事逃逸事件中，这疑虑便荡然无存——那辆车突然偏离道路，直奔他们而来。就在看似无法停下的刹那，车子猛地刹车，旋转着停下，后保险杠离加持的腿仅几厘米之遥，溅起一片泥土和草叶。

The insane man hadn't shifted an inch despite the half-ton of metal driving directly at him.
那疯子面对直冲而来的半吨重金属，竟纹丝不动。

Shinji sighed diplomatically as the dust settled. "Yep... that's her alright."
尘埃落定之际，真嗣带着外交官般的叹息说道：“嗯，确实是她。”

XXX

After what Shinji could only assume was a lot of flirting between Kaji and Misato behind the shack, their guardian finally returned and waved the teenagers towards her car. From there, the scenery predictably flew by as Misato seemed to be attempting to achieve some sort of land speed record. Of course, she couldn't simply drive up the car elevator; Misato seemed almost antsy at the long wait and predictably put the pedal to the metal once out on the open road towards Tokyo-3.
真嗣猜测，卡吉和美里在小屋后一定有过不少调情，之后他们的监护人终于回来了，挥手让少年们朝她的车走去。一路上，景色飞快地后退，美里似乎在试图打破某种陆地速度纪录。当然，她不能直接开车上汽车电梯；美里对等待显得有些不耐烦，一驶上通往东京-3 的开放道路，便立刻猛踩油门。

Somehow, they once again made it back to the apartment building with not a scratch on the car. Shinji fought the urge to lie down on the ground and hold on until everything stopped spinning, and Asuka looked like she'd fared little better.
不知何故，他们又一次将车完好无损地开回了公寓楼。真嗣极力克制着躺下直到世界停止旋转的冲动，而明日香的状态也并不比他好多少。

Pen-pen was ecstatic to see them again, rushing up and hugging their legs as soon as they came through the door, and receiving pats on the head in return. Until he reached Rei who, instead of a simple pat, picked the penguin up and hugged him to her chest. Pen-pen looked surprised, but made no effort to get free.
企鹅 Pen-pen 再次见到他们时欣喜若狂，一进门就冲上去抱住他们的腿，并得到了抚摸头的回应。轮到 Rei 时，她没有简单地拍拍它，而是把它抱起来紧紧拥在胸前。Pen-pen 显得有些惊讶，但没有试图挣脱。

It was hardly a shock that Misato's apartment looked a little messy after such a long absence. Dirty dishes and beer cans littered the kitchen, and a thin film of dust had settled. Upon seeing this Shinji headed right for the cleaning supplies, but made it all of a couple metres before a hand slapped down upon his shoulder.
美里公寓因长时间无人居住而显得有些杂乱，这并不出人意料。厨房里堆满了未洗的碗碟和空啤酒罐，地面上也积了一层薄灰。真嗣见状，本能地朝清洁用品走去，然而没走几步，一只手突然搭在了他的肩上。

"Nope, you're not worrying about that today," said Misato, the owner of the hand. "Let's just order some takeout and enjoy ourselves for a bit longer."
不，今天你不用为那事烦恼，" 手的主人，碇真嗣说，"咱们叫点外卖，再放松一会儿吧。

"Takeout?" Asuka pointed at the clock, which showed the time to be 1:25pm. "It's only just after lunchtime."
点外卖吗？" 明日香指着时钟，上面显示着 1:25。"现在才刚过午饭时间。

"...Oh," Misato lamely replied. "Huh. Feels like it should be dinner time, ya know? After the day we've had."
...哦，" 三佐有些无力地应道。"哈。总觉得该吃晚饭了，你说是吧？毕竟今天过得这么折腾。

Shinji's stomach, once again displaying its talent for perfect timing, chose that moment to growl. Loudly.
真嗣的肚子又一次恰到好处地展示了它的时机感，就在那一刻大声地咕噜作响。

Asuka turned an amused look on him, hands on her hips. "Well now, I guess I know what my first task will be!" Her mood quickly changed, her face turning pale. "Wait. Shit. We've been gone for two weeks. Half the stuff in our fridges has probably gone bad."
明日香带着戏谑的神情转向他，双手叉腰。"看来，我第一个任务已经明确了！" 但她的情绪很快转变，脸色变得苍白。"等等，糟了。我们离开了两周，冰箱里估计有一半的东西都坏掉了。"

Shinji and Misato shared looks of unease, glancing at her refrigerator.
真嗣与美里面露不安，目光投向她的冰箱。

"...Well, actual first order of business will have to be to clean them out," Misato groaned. "You two go sort your kitchen out, I'll handle the fridge here. Rei, could you please check the pantry for anything that might be out of date?"
...唉，首先得把这些东西清理干净，" 碇真嗣叹息道。"你们两个去整理厨房，我来负责这里的冰箱。绫波，麻烦你检查一下储藏室，看看有没有过期的食品。

Rei nodded, and Shinji and Asuka quickly headed next door to their own apartment. The place was just as dusty as Misato's, if not more so, but that was set aside as the two of them dealt with their kitchen. Practically everything but snacks and drinks had to be thrown out –Shinji quickly grabbing a packet of chips to momentarily settle his stomach– and Asuka prepared a list of replacements to buy. Afterwards they returned to Misato's apartment, where Asuka set their list down next to one that Rei had apparently written out.
绫波点头示意，真嗣和明日香便匆匆回到隔壁自己的住处。那里的灰尘不亚于美里家，甚至更甚，但两人暂且放下这一问题，开始整理厨房。除了零食和饮料，几乎所有物品都得丢弃——真嗣顺手拿起一包薯片，暂时缓解了饥饿感——而明日香则列出了需要购买的替换品清单。随后，他们返回美里的公寓，明日香将自己的清单放在了绫波已经准备好的清单旁边。

One rather large grocery shopping trip later -some of the bags having to be placed on the passengers' laps- and both refrigerators looked like no time had passed at all. Asuka quickly set to work, drafting Rei and Shinji to assist while keeping an eye on Misato so that no 'extras' found their way into her cooking.
一次颇为庞大的购物之旅后，部分购物袋只得搁在乘客膝上，两个冰箱内却仿佛时光未曾流转。明日香迅速着手，召集绫波和真嗣协助，同时紧盯美里，以防她的料理中掺入不必要的“额外”成分。

Twenty minutes later, Shinji sat down at the kitchen table and, after the traditional 'thank you for the meal', set to work on his portion.
二十分钟后，真嗣在餐桌旁坐下，遵循传统说了句“感谢赐予这顿饭”，随即开始享用自己的那份。

He was the first to finish, his plate empty in only a couple minutes.
他率先吃完，盘子在短短几分钟内便空空如也。

Asuka raised an eyebrow, but said nothing as she doled out another portion.
明日香眉头一挑，却未发一言，继续分发了一份。

That, too, vanished into the black hole that had taken up residence in Shinji's stomach.
那同样被吞噬进了真嗣胃中仿佛存在的黑洞。

With some embarrassment, he eventually admitted that it had been close to two days since he'd last eaten anything, and he even averted his gaze from Asuka as he confessed that he had not felt like eating much the past couple of weeks.
他略显尴尬地承认，自己已经快两天没进食了，并且在向明日香坦白过去几周食欲不振时，还特意避开了她的视线。

Asuka narrowed her eyes. "Just like before I got on your case about how much you eat," she remarked, half-growling at Shinji. He could only blush, but continued eating.
明日香眯起眼睛，半带怒气地对真嗣说：“就像之前我责怪你吃太多一样。”他脸颊泛红，却依旧继续吃着。

Finally though, even he had to turn down a refill, having eaten almost as much as the other four, Pen-pen included, combined.
最终，连他也只能婉拒续杯，因为他几乎吃下了其他四人，连同企鹅彭彭在内，加在一起的食量。

"Well, I don't think we'll need to worry about dinner after that," said Misato, letting out a groan of satisfaction. "You certainly decided to make up for lost time, Asuka."
哎，看来那之后我们不必为晚餐发愁了，" 碇真嗣满足地叹息道，"明日香，你真是要好好弥补之前的时光啊。

Asuka shrugged. "I figured that since I was cooking now, I might as well make it a really big lunch so that I didn't have to make something else later."
明日香耸耸肩说：“既然已经开始做饭了，干脆就做一顿丰盛的午餐，省得晚点还得再做。”

Misato gave her an understanding nod. "You actually look a little tired. Gonna go collapse into a food coma?"
“Misato 理解地点了点头。“你看起来有些疲倦。是不是打算吃饱了去睡个昏天暗地？”

Asuka was about to respond, but she had to quickly bring up a hand to cover a sudden yawn. "Actually that seems like a good idea, to be honest."
明日香本想回应，却突然打了个哈欠，急忙用手捂住。“说实话，这主意倒挺好的。”

It was contagious; Shinji yawned wide enough to feel the sides of his mouth ache. "Me too, I think," he said. "Maybe now that Asuka's back... I can get some real sleep."
这哈欠似乎会传染；真嗣张大嘴巴，连嘴角都感到痛。“我也有同感，”他说。“也许现在明日香回来了……我能好好睡一觉了。”

He was expecting a teasing comment from Misato, but instead she just smiled sympathetically at him. "Go on then. Leave your phones here if you like, I'll deal with anyone trying to interrupt your naptime. If an Angel shows up I will politely tell it to fuck right off."
他原以为会听到碇真嗣的玩笑话，然而她只是带着同情的微笑看着他。“去吧，手机可以留这儿，我会挡住任何想打扰你午睡的家伙。万一使徒来了，我会客气地请它滚开。”

Shinji and Asuka chuckled at that mental image, and left their phones on the kitchen table as they headed next door.
真嗣和明日香被那幅画面逗得咯咯笑，将手机搁在厨房桌上，便前往隔壁。

Once there Shinji made the quick decision to change their bedsheets, having forgotten when exactly they'd last been washed and choosing to err on the side of cleanliness. When everything was finally sorted out, Shinji and Asuka bid each other goodnight despite the time of day and headed to their rooms for some well-deserved rest.
某次，真嗣迅速决定更换床单，因记不清上次清洗的确切时间，便决定保持清洁。一切整理就绪后，真嗣和明日香尽管时间尚早，仍互道晚安，各自回房休息，以恢复精力。

XXX

Shinji awoke with a start, suddenly filled with apprehension and shock. A glance at his alarm clock told him that it was just before midnight. As he'd half-expected, the planned nap had turned into full on sleep. He tried to rummage through his memory to catch whatever it was that had awoken him, but came to one conclusion: whatever it was, it hadn't been quite the same as when he and Asuka usually woke up in sync.
真嗣猛然惊醒，心中涌起不安与震惊。瞥见闹钟，时间刚过午夜。不出所料，原本打算的小憩已变成深睡。他努力回想是什么惊扰了他，最终意识到：这次醒来，与他和明日香平常同步醒来的感觉截然不同。

A moment later, he heard a knock on his door.
过了一会儿，他听到敲门声。

"Shinji?" came Asuka's partially muffled voice. "I know you woke up too. Could you... come to the kitchen? Like we usually do?"
真嗣？" Asuka 的声音有些含糊不清。"我知道你也醒了。可以的话，来厨房好吗？就像我们平时那样。

"Yeah, sure," he called out in response.
"当然，"他随即应声道。

In the kitchen, Shinji was surprised to see Asuka pacing back and forth with a hand on her head. This was definitely not like the previous unwanted wake-ups they'd jointly experienced. He could feel... something just on the edges of his mind, like a word dangling right off the edge of his tongue.
厨房中，真嗣惊讶地发现明日香正扶着头来回踱步，这与他们以往共同遭遇的不愉快醒来截然不同。他隐约感觉到……某种东西正悬在他意识的边缘，仿佛一个即将脱口而出的词语。

Finally, after a couple more minutes of pacing, Asuka looked at Shinji and then sat down at the table; he quickly joined her.
最后，又踱了几分钟后，明日香望向真嗣，随即在桌边坐下；他立刻跟了过去。

"Shinji, something happened while I was inside Unit-02," she said, looking nervous. "Something... big. I really don't know if you're going to believe me though, since I can hardly believe it myself."
真嗣，我在驾驶二号机时遇到了一些情况，"她神情紧张地说。"事情很重大。我都不确定你是否会相信，我自己都觉得难以置信。

Shinji blinked at her, took a breath, and slowly reached out to cover her visibly shaking hand with his own. "Whatever it is you want to tell me, I'll listen and do my best to understand. After everything we've been through, even if you told me the sky was green I'd consider it."
真嗣眨着眼凝视她，深吸一口气后，缓缓伸出手，轻轻覆盖住她颤抖不已的手。"无论你有什么想说的，我都会聆听并尽力去理解。毕竟我们共同经历了那么多，哪怕你说天空是绿色的，我也会认真考虑。"

Asuka stared at where their hands met, redness creeping up her face, but her hand remained where it was. "A-alright. Besides... if I'm right about this... I might be right about something to do with you, too."
明日香凝视着两人手相触之处，脸颊渐渐染上红晕，然而她的手并未移开。"好吧。而且...如果我对这件事的看法没错...那么关于你的某些事，我可能也猜对了。"

"With... me?" Shinji frowned, trying to work out what Asuka could be about to tell him. But nothing could have prepared him for the words that left Asuka's mouth.
"跟我一起吗？" 碇真嗣皱眉思索，试图猜透明日香即将吐露的秘密。然而，他万万没想到明日香接下来的话。

"Mama... she's... she's inside Unit-02!"
妈妈...她...她在二号机内部！

### Chapter 38 Open Our Heart To Our Eva?

Shinji stared across the table at Asuka, his mouth opening and closing as his brain struggled to process what she had just said.
真嗣凝视着桌子对面的明日香，嘴巴张了又合，努力理解她刚才的话语。

"Your... your mother?" he finally managed to choke out. "But... you said-"
你...你母亲？"他好不容易才说出这句话。"可是...你不是说-

"I know what I said," Asuka cut him off, her eyes flicking to him for a second before staring down at the table with her forehead resting on her free hand. That hand, too, was trembling, and Shinji was fairly certain that one of her legs was fidgeting rapidly as well.
"我记得我说过的话，"明日香打断他，目光匆匆瞥了他一眼，随即低头凝视桌面，额头倚在一只手上。那只手同样在微微颤抖，真嗣几乎可以肯定，她的另一条腿也在不安地快速抖动。

"Asuka," he gingerly said. He didn't want to consider that she was lying, or that her extended stay inside Unit-02 had taken a toll on her mind, but there was one thing that, right until this very moment, he had been sure about. "Do you... want me to call NERV?"
Asuka," 他轻声说道。他不愿考虑她是否在撒谎，或者她在二号机内长时间的滞留是否已影响了她的心智，但有一件事，直到此刻，他始终坚信不疑。"你想让我联系 NERV 吗？

There was no response for a few seconds, until suddenly Asuka's free hand formed a fist and smacked down on the table. "No," she replied. "If I'm right, they... never mind for now."
几秒的沉默后，明日香空着的手突然攥成拳头，重重地敲在桌上。“不，”她断然道，“如果我猜得没错，他们……这事暂且搁置。”

Now Shinji was starting to get concerned.
此刻，真嗣开始感到不安。

"You're thinking I've gone mental after being stuck in my Eva, aren't you?"
你肯定认为我被困在伊娃里后精神失常了，是不是？

There was no point trying to deny it. "Well, a very small part of me is thinking that," Shinji admitted, gamely withstanding the look Asuka gave him. "We've both gone through so much this year. But I'm just going to shut up and let you talk. You did imply that it could affect me too."
否认这一点毫无意义。"好吧，我心里确实有那么一小部分这么想，" 真嗣坦诚地说，勇敢地迎着明日香的目光。"今年我们都经历了不少。我还是决定保持沉默，让你说。你之前也暗示过，这可能也会牵扯到我。"

Asuka huffed bemusedly. "Smart." She took a deep breath and sat upright, her hand gently slipping out of Shinji's grasp and rising up to her head. "Okay. I remember... fighting that Angel and our power going out, then suddenly it was like I woke up after a long sleep. I looked around, and I was back in my bedroom in Germany. The home I'd stayed in until not long after..."
明日香带着几分困惑地哼了一声。“真有你的。”她深吸一口气，挺直腰杆，手缓缓从真嗣手中抽离，举至头顶。“好了。我记得……与那使徒激战，随后电力突然中断，紧接着仿佛从长眠中苏醒。我四下一看，竟已身处德国的卧室。那是我不久前还住着的地方……”

Shinji waited patiently as Asuka trailed off for a moment, grimly recalling how he too had once been living with his parents a long, long time ago. Until... that happened and then he'd ended up living with that teacher who, while a decent person, was not his family.
真嗣耐心地等待，明日香一时语塞，他不禁回忆起自己也曾与父母共度时光，那已是遥远的过去。直到……那场变故，之后他便寄居在那位老师家中，虽然老师为人正直，但终究不是亲人。

"So I look around, pretty sure I'm just dreaming," Asuka went on, various emotions parading across her face as she spoke. "But everything seems far too... real. I can feel the fabric of the bedsheets, hear the rain pattering against the window. And then... Mama walks into the room, and right then I knew it wasn't a dream. I mean, I've had dreams involving her before, obviously. Not all of them good ones either. But they'd always been... fuzzy. Weird. Obviously dreams. But this? It was like I'd actually been sent back in time.
"我环顾四周，确信自己只是在梦中，" 明日香继续说着，脸上情绪万千。"然而，一切却异常真实。我能感觉到床单的触感，听见雨滴敲打窗玻璃的声音。接着... 妈妈走进房间，那一刻我便明白，这不是梦。我以前也梦见过她，那些梦有好有坏，但总是模糊不清，充满怪异，明显是梦境。但这次？仿佛我真的穿越回了过去。

"Then... the moment she sees me, Mama rushes over to me, pulls me out of bed and hugs me." Asuka wrapped her arms around herself in a pale imitation of the hug, her eyes vacantly staring into the past. "She starts talking about how great it is to finally hold me for real and..."
接着...妈妈一见到我，便急忙跑过来，从床上把我拉起，紧紧拥入怀中。" Asuka 用双臂环抱自己，试图模仿那个拥抱，眼神空洞地凝视着过往。"她开始说起终于能实实在在地拥抱我，感觉有多么美好，还有...

Shinji inhaled sharply. "Is that... when you realised that she's been inside Unit-02 this whole time?"
真嗣倒吸一口凉气。“难道是...那一刻你才发觉她一直都在二号机里？”

Asuka's head shot up so fast it made him flinch. She looked at him for a moment, then gave a shaky nod. "Yeah. I'm back home in Germany, but I'm still the same age. Mama wasn't talking about how long it'd been since we'd last met or anything like that, she was acting like she'd... I dunno... been on the other side of a pane of glass for the last decade. Watching me. She was happier about holding me than seeing me.
明日香的头猛地抬起，速度之快让他不由得一缩。她凝视了他片刻，随后微微颤抖着点了点头。“没错。我回到了德国的家，但我的年纪依旧如故。妈妈并未提及我们上次相见已过去多久，她的举止仿佛……我也不清楚……过去十年她一直隔着一层玻璃在旁观察我。她抱着我比见到我还要开心。”

"After that, we... well... talked." The corners of Asuka's mouth started to turn upwards, and her eyes were beginning to shimmer. "To know that she'd been with me all along, I just..." She broke off, roughly wiping the back of a hand across her face. "Damnit, I swore at Mama's funeral that I'd never cry again..."
之后，我们...嗯...聊了起来。" Asuka 的嘴角微微上扬，眼中闪烁着光芒。"得知她始终与我同在，我..." 她突然哽咽，用手背匆匆拭去泪水。"该死，我在妈妈葬礼上发誓过再也不流泪的...

"Asuka..." Shinji reached out and gently grasped her hand, ignoring the dampness as he pulled it away from her face, causing Asuka to gasp sharply in surprise. "I don't see any problem with that. After all your mother is alive, isn't she?"
Asuka..." 真嗣伸手轻握她的手，不顾其湿润，从她脸上移开，使明日香惊愕地倒吸一口气。"这没什么不妥吧。你母亲不是还健在吗？

She looked at his hand clasping her own, eyes darting between it and his face. Shinji felt a sudden strong urge to let go and apologise for being so forward, but he managed to stubbornly hold firm.
她凝视着他紧握自己手的手，目光在手与脸之间徘徊。真嗣突然涌起一股强烈的冲动，想要松开手并为自己的唐突道歉，但他还是倔强地坚持着。

"S-Shinji, I..." Her free hand coming up to finish drying her eyes, Asuka took a deep breath. "I'm not really sure what is going on with her right now. How is she in the Eva when I saw-" She cut herself off.
"S-Shinji, 我..." 她用空着的手继续擦干眼泪，深吸一口气。"我现在真的不太明白她的情况。我明明看到她那样，她怎么还能驾驶 Eva 呢——" 她突然停了下来。

"Saw... her body?" Shinji hazarded a guess. It was the only thing that made sense; Asuka would have seen her mother's body at the funeral, if not at some point before then.
"看到...她母亲的遗体了吗？" 真嗣试探着猜测。这是唯一说得通的；如果之前没见过，那么在葬礼上，明日香理应会见到她母亲的遗体。

"...Yeah," Asuka mumbled. "How the hell is it possible?"
...嗯，" 明日香低声道。"这究竟是怎么一回事？

"I wish I could answer that, I really do." Shinji exhaled in exasperation. "We pilot giant robots to fight aliens, our friend can see people's souls, you own my soul... but I don't have an explanation for that."
我真希望能解答这个问题，真的。" 真嗣无奈地叹了口气。"我们驾驶巨型机器人对抗外星人，我们的朋友能洞察人的灵魂，而你掌控着我的灵魂...但我对此无法给出解释。

"Hah, if you could explain it I'd consider you smarter than Doctor Akagi," Asuka replied with a smirk that quickly faded into wide-eyed astonishment. "Wait... do you think NERV knows?"
哈，你要是能解释清楚，我可就真觉得你比赤木博士还厉害了，"明日香半开玩笑地回应，但随即她的笑容转为一脸震惊。"等等...你是不是觉得 NERV 已经知道了？

Shinji opened his mouth, then closed it and frowned. Something like this... a pilot's dead mother somehow inhabiting an Evangelion, surely NERV would have to know about it, right? Doctor Akagi was constantly running scans on the Evangelions. There was no way she could have happened to miss the fact that a second... or rather third mind was inside Unit-02.
真嗣张开嘴，随即又合上，眉头紧锁。这种事……驾驶员已故的母亲居然寄宿在 EVA 里，NERV 不可能不知情吧？赤木博士一直在对 EVA 进行全面扫描。她绝不可能漏掉 Unit-02 内存在另一个……或者说第三个意识的事实。

"I... really don't know," he admitted. "If they did, somebody would have told you, wouldn't they?"
我...确实不清楚，"他坦言。"如果他们知情，想必早就有人告诉你了，不是吗？

"I'm not so sure." Asuka extracted her hand from his grasp, tapping the index finger against her chin. "They'd have to know. They've had the Evas for a decade. If they don't know, then they're either too stupid to see it or their systems simply can't detect Mama. Or they do know... and are actively keeping it a secret from me."
我对此并不十分确定。" 明日香从他的手中抽回手，用食指轻敲着自己的下巴。"他们应该知道。他们拥有 EVA 已经十年了。如果他们不知道，那要么是他们太蠢没意识到，要么就是他们的系统无法检测到妈妈。又或者他们确实知道……却故意对我隐瞒。

"That..." Shinji blinked in puzzlement. "Why would they do that?"
那……" 真嗣不解地眨眼。"他们为何要这么做呢？

"Why does Wondergirl have the ability to see souls?" Asuka countered. "Why are the Angels specifically attacking Tokyo-3, instead of showing up in, say, Australia?"
为什么 Wondergirl 拥有看见灵魂的能力？" 明日香反问道。"为何使徒们偏偏选择攻击第三新东京市，而不是出现在澳大利亚等地呢？

Why did Rei tell him not to speak of what had happened during their disastrous dual-sync test? What did happen then? Not to mention numerous other strange occurrences.
绫为何告诫他不要提及双同步测试中的灾难性事件？当时究竟发生了什么？此外，还有众多其他离奇事件。

"NERV... has secrets," he mumbled out loud. "Even the Evas themselves are-" He paused, as something Asuka recently said sprang to mind. "...Ten years they've had the Evas, you said?"
NERV... 藏着秘密，" 他低声自语。"就连 EVA 本身也是——" 他突然顿住，Asuka 最近的话在脑海中闪现。"...你提到他们拥有 EVA 已经十年了？

Asuka quirked an eyebrow at him. "Yeah. I was chosen to be a pilot a decade ago."
明日香对他挑眉道：“没错，十年前我就被选定为驾驶员了。”

"And back then, did they tell you why they needed the Evas?"
当时，他们有没有告诉你为何需要那些 Evas？

"Y-" She looked away, confusion spreading over her face. "I... don't know for sure. I do remember someone saying that the fate of the world would be in my hands. That I would have to train for the next ten years to be ready."
"Y-" 她转开视线，脸上露出困惑之色。“我... 确实不太清楚。但我记得有人说过，世界的命运将由我掌控。我需要经过十年的训练才能做好准备。”

"But did anyone even know about the Angels back then?" Shinji pressed. He tapped a hand against his chest. "I didn't know they existed until one almost stepped on me! And then suddenly there's a giant robot perfect for fighting it already built and waiting to be deployed! And despite me supposedly having a less than one percent chance to be able to pilot it, I did just fine. Sort of," he quickly added, remembering that he hadn't exactly won the fight himself.
"但那时真有人了解使徒吗？" 碇真嗣追问着，拍了拍自己的胸口。"我是在一个使徒差点踩到我时，才得知它们的存在！紧接着，一台专为对抗它而造的巨型机器人就已准备就绪，随时可以投入战斗！尽管我驾驶它的几率据说不到百分之一，我还是成功了。算是吧，" 他急忙补充，意识到自己并未真正赢得那场战斗。

Asuka stared at him. Or perhaps through him, it was hard to tell. "Yes. According to NERV your Eva went 'berserk', killed the Angel while you were unconscious, and then shut down immediately afterwards. Does that really sound like something you'd call 'berserk'? Why didn't it continue rampaging through Tokyo-3 until it ran out of power?"
明日香凝视着他，又或许视线穿透了他，难以判断。"没错。按照 NERV 的描述，你的 Eva 失控了，在你失去意识时击杀了使徒，随后立刻停机。这真的像是所谓的'失控'吗？为何它没有继续在东京-3 肆虐，直至能量耗尽？"

"Well... Rei's Eva went berserk before I came to Tokyo-3," Shinji replied thoughtfully. "Something went wrong in the test and Unit-00 tried to smash its way into the control room until it ran out of power."
在我来到第三新东京市之前，绫波的 Eva 就曾失控，" 碇真嗣沉思着说，"测试中出了差错，零号机试图冲破控制室，直至电力耗尽。

"See, now that sounds more like it," replied Asuka. "So why didn't your Eva do something similar?"
看，现在这样才像话，"飞鸟回应说。"那你的 Eva 为何没有类似的举动呢？

Shinji hesitated, thinking the situation over. It felt like Asuka was trying to lead him towards a certain answer without simply telling him. She was trying to get him to work it out for himself.
真嗣犹豫着，深思熟虑。他感觉到明日香似乎在引导他接近某个答案，而非直接告知。她希望他自己领悟。

During his first battle, he'd lost consciousness and Unit-01 finished the fight for him, powering down the moment the threat was eliminated. Unit-02 had done something very similar against the Fourteenth Angel, only it had reactivated after the battery was empty and the Angel was about to kill them. Asuka had been taken into the Evangelion's core, and supposedly-
在他初次战斗时，他因失去意识而无法行动，初号机随即接管战斗，并在威胁解除后自动关闭。二号机对抗第十四使徒时也经历了类似情形，电池耗尽后，在使徒即将夺命之际，二号机奇迹般地重新激活。明日香被卷入了福音战士的核心之中，传闻——

He mentally shook his head. No, he decided to trust in Asuka and believe her story. She had discovered her mother was inside Unit-02. Her mother had... taken control somehow to protect her daughter.
他在内心否定了自己的疑虑。是的，他决定信任明日香，相信她的话。她发现自己的母亲被困在二号机中。她的母亲不知何故掌控了机体，只为保护女儿。

Protect... 防护...

A memory suddenly flashed in front of his mind's eye. Rei, having fallen off her gurney in Unit-01's cage. A massive chunk of the ceiling falling towards them... and then suddenly a purple limb was in the way, shielding them from the debris. Expressions of amazement from Doctor Akagi and Misato that the Evangelion shouldn't have been able to move.
一段记忆突然在他脑海中闪现。零在初号机的笼子里从担架上跌落。一大块天花板正朝他们砸下……随即，一条紫色的肢体蓦地挡在前面，为他们挡住了坠落的碎片。赤木博士和美里脸上露出惊讶之色，因为初号机本不该有移动的能力。

"Shinji." 真嗣。

Asuka's voice interrupted his trip down memory lane. He glanced up at her.
明日香的声音打断了他的回忆之旅。他抬头望向她。

"It looks like you've almost got it," she remarked, an eyebrow quirked at him.
"你似乎快掌握了，"她评论着，眉毛微微一挑。

"Y-...yes?" he hesitantly replied. "But... it just seems so... unbelievable."
Y-...是吗？" 他迟疑地回应，"只是...这实在让人难以置信。

An amused scoff was Asuka's initial response. "We've already listed off a lot of crazy shit we've been through this year. How much of that would you have once called 'unbelievable'?"
飞鸟最初以一声轻蔑的笑作为回应。"今年我们经历的疯狂事可不少，你以前又有多少次觉得这些是'难以置信'的呢？"

"...You've already worked out exactly what it is, haven't you?"
...你已经完全明白这是什么了，对吧？

She gave him a cool look. "Of course I have. I know what you're about to say, and though it sounds strange, all the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. So just say it."
她冷静地看了他一眼，说道：“我当然清楚。我知道你要说什么，虽然听起来有些不可思议，但所有的线索都恰到好处地吻合。你就直说吧。”

Shinji slowly drew himself up, having previously been slumping forward without even realising. "O-okay then..." He rubbed his eyes and then looked across the table at Asuka. "Your mother... is in Unit-02."
真嗣慢慢挺直了身体，之前他未曾察觉自己一直前倾。"那...好吧..." 他揉了揉眼睛，随后望向桌子对面的明日香。"你的母亲...就在二号机里。"

"Yes...?" Asuka prompted.
"怎么了...？" 明日香催问道。

"And Unit-01... has... my mother... in it."
而且，零号机里...竟然有...我的母亲...

Asuka slowly nodded. She began talking, but it was as if she was on the other side of a thick window. Shinji blinked, and suddenly there was a window in front of him. Other voices were speaking, but he couldn't make them out either. He reached outpudgy fingers to touch the glass, curious about the big purple thing on the other side that looked kinda like one of his toys. Somewhere nearby Daddy and the other grown-ups were talking, but there were a lot of big words he didn't know. He also didn't know where Mummy was. She had given him a hug and a kiss, wearing funny-looking pyjamas, then put him down on the floor and gone off somewhere.
明日香缓缓点头，开始说话，声音却仿佛隔着一层厚玻璃。真嗣眨眼间，眼前竟出现了一扇窗。其他声音也在说话，但他同样听不真切。他伸出胖嘟嘟的手指触碰玻璃，好奇地打量着对面那个紫色的大物件，它有点像他的一个玩具。不远处，爸爸和其他大人在交谈，但用了很多他不懂的大词。他也不清楚妈妈去了哪里。她穿着滑稽的睡衣，给了他一个拥抱和亲吻，然后把他放在地上，自己便离开了。

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

He blinked and looked around. Who said that? Nobody in the room was looking at him. His cheek suddenlyerupted in pain and he almost fell off his chair.
他眨了眨眼，环视四周。是谁说的那句话？房间里的人都没有看向他。突然，他的脸颊一阵剧痛，差点从椅子上跌落。

"Shinji!" Asuka shouted again, arm raised in the air and ready to deliver another hit.
"真嗣！" 阿苏卡再次高声呼喊，手臂高高举起，准备再次挥击。

"Ow!" Shinji brought a hand up to his stinging cheek as he recovered his balance on the chair. "W-what just happened?" he asked, blinking inexplicable tears out of his eyes.
"哎哟！" 真嗣一手捂着火辣辣的脸颊，一边在椅子上稳住身体。"刚、刚才怎么了？" 他眨着眼，泪水不知为何涌了出来。

Asuka lowered her arm, but remained leaning over the table staring right into his face. "You went kinda... funny," she replied. "Your eyes were glassy and you weren't responding when I called out to you."
明日香放下手臂，依旧俯身在桌前，直勾勾地盯着他的脸。“你刚才有点不对劲，”她回应说。“你的眼神呆滞，我叫你时你也没反应。”

"Oh... um..." Shinji lamely replied. "I... think I remembered... something?"
哦... 呃..." 真嗣支支吾吾地回答，"我... 好像记起了点什么？

Her expression rapidly changing from concern to curiosity, Asuka slowly sat back down. "What did you remember that made you space out like that?"
她的表情迅速从忧虑转为好奇，明日香缓缓坐回座位。“你记起了什么，以至于那样出神？”

"I-" Shinji mentally raced to recall the details, but so much was already slipping away. "I was... in a big room, with a giant glass window... Father was there, and other people too... ugh!" He clutched at his head as a spike of agony was driven into his skull. "Damnit... it's... something happened... argh!"
我-" 真嗣拼命回想，但许多细节已开始模糊。"我在一个宽敞的房间，有一面巨大的玻璃窗... 父亲和其他人都在... 啊！" 他痛苦地抱住头，一阵剧痛袭来。"可恶... 发生了什么... 啊！

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

Through lidded, teary eyes, Shinji saw Asuka rush around the table to stand next to him, placing a hand on his back. He willed his body to take deep breaths as more spikes attacked his brain, trying to focus on the sensation of Asuka's hand on his back instead of the agony in his head. An eternity passed but he kept breathing, refusing to be brought low by the pain, stubbornly standing strong until the attack finally abated, and only he remained.
透过泪眼朦胧的眼睛，真嗣看到明日香急忙绕过桌子，来到他身边，一只手轻放在他的背上。他努力控制自己深呼吸，当一波波刺痛袭向大脑时，他试图将注意力集中在明日香手心的温暖上，而非头部的剧痛。仿佛过了永恒，他依然坚持呼吸，不愿被痛苦击倒，顽强地挺立着，直到那阵痛楚终于消退，只剩下他独自一人。

It almost came as a relief when his forehead suddenly impacted against the table. Before he had time to take in this new, more real pain, the hand on his back gripped his shirt and hauled him back upright. Asuka's face appeared in front of him, her eyes searching for something for a moment.
当他的额头猛地撞上桌子时，他几乎感到一种释然。还没等他反应过来这股更真实的痛楚，背后的手已紧紧抓住他的衬衫，将他拽回直立。明日香的脸庞随即映入眼帘，她的双眼似乎在寻找着什么，片刻不停。

"...You okay?" she finally asked.
"……你还好吗？"她终于开口问道。

His head still throbbed uncomfortably, the threat evident if he continued his previous line of thought, but Shinji gave a weak nod. "I'll... be fine."
他的头依旧隐隐作痛，若继续之前的思路，显然不妙，但真嗣还是勉强点了点头。“我...会好的。”

Asuka slowly returned to her side of the table, sitting down and hissing in annoyance. "Damnit. Sorry, Shinji. If I'd known you'd react like that I'd have kept my mouth shut."
明日香慢慢回到桌对面坐下，不悦地嘶声道：“真倒霉。抱歉，真嗣。早知你会这样，我就不该多嘴。”

"It's fine, Asuka," Shinji insisted, shaking his head despite the ache it caused. "I didn't know it'd happen either."
没事的，明日香，" 真嗣坚持道，尽管摇头时感到疼痛，他还是摇了摇头。"我也没料到会发生这种事。

"Seems like you've got some repressed memories in your head," Asuka mused, staring intently at him. "It'd be a good idea not to try and force them to surface, despite how... important they might be."
看来你脑海中藏着一些被压抑的记忆，" 明日香若有所思地说，目光紧锁在他身上。"尽管这些记忆可能至关重要，但还是别勉强它们浮出水面为好。

Shinji sighed. He'd been so close to something, he just knew it. "Well I suppose for now we should focus on the important thing."
真嗣叹了口气，他确信自己曾与某物近在咫尺。"嗯，我想眼下我们还是应该把注意力放在重要的事情上。"

"Right. The fact that our mothers are in our Evas and nobody bothered to tell us."
确实如此。我们的母亲就在我们的 Eva 机体中，却无人告知我们这一事实。

"We can't exactly do something about it now though."
尽管我们现在确实无法对此采取具体措施。

Asuka glanced up at the wall clock, and Shinji followed suit. It wasn't even one o'clock in the morning yet.
明日香抬头望向墙上的时钟，真嗣也随之望去。时间尚未到凌晨一点。

"...In the morning?" they both asked at the same time. A pair of nods. "In the morning."
是在早上吗？" 两人异口同声地问。彼此点头确认："对，在早上。

Asuka began to head back to her bedroom, but before she reached the doorway, Shinji abruptly grabbed onto her hand. She turned to him in surprise and puzzlement, and he felt his face heat up.
明日香正要回房，不料刚到门口，真嗣猛地抓住了她的手。她惊讶又困惑地看向他，顿时感到脸颊发烫。

"Um... there's... something I kinda forgot to do before," Shinji admitted, unable to look Asuka in the eyes. "I mean, we kinda got sidetracked with Doctor Akagi coming in, and how I was the one that brought you back, and-"
呃...有件事...我之前似乎忘了做，" 真嗣坦白，目光躲闪不敢看明日香。"我是说，我们被赤木博士的突然到来和我是带你回来的这件事给岔开了，还有-

"Shinji," Asuka gently interrupted. "Don't worry about that now. What did you forget to do?"
真嗣，" 明日香轻声打断道，"现在别担心那个了。你忘了做什么？

He tried to make eye contact with Asuka, he really did. But every time his gaze met hers, it was like some invisible force shoved his head to the side and made him blush harder. It didn't help that Asuka kept looking more and more confused each time. Eventually, Shinji's eyes settled on the necklace, his gift to her; the sight of that sparkling sapphire dangling from Asuka's neck helped to calm him down. Shinji took a deep breath, and brought his eyes up to finally look at her properly.
他努力想与明日香眼神交流，真的尽力了。然而，每当他的视线与她交汇，仿佛有股无形之力将他的头扭向一旁，脸颊更是涨得通红。明日香每次都愈发显得困惑，这让他更加窘迫。最后，他的目光停留在那条项链上，那是他赠予她的礼物；那颗璀璨的蓝宝石垂挂在明日香的颈间，让他稍感安心。真嗣深吸一口气，鼓足勇气，终于直视她的双眼。

"Asuka... welcome back." Asuka...欢迎回来。

In the blink of an eye, Shinji let go of Asuka's hand and wrapped both arms around her, hugging tightly like he was worried she would disappear again. Asuka let out a sound of shock, and her hands moved to Shinji's shoulders as if she was about to shove him away. He even felt her begin to push, but at the last second she relaxed her arms.
刹那间，真嗣松开了明日香的手，双臂紧紧地拥抱着她，仿佛害怕她会再次消失。明日香惊叫一声，双手本能地搭在真嗣肩上，似乎要推开他。他感觉到她开始推拒，但最终她放松了双臂。

"I'm... so glad you're back with m-... with us," Shinji continued. His eyes began to sting with tears; he was glad Asuka couldn't see his face right now.
"我... 真的很高兴你回来了，和我们在一起，" 真嗣接着说。他的眼睛开始刺痛，泪水几乎要夺眶而出；他庆幸明日香此时看不见他的表情。

"...You dummy," Asuka whispered, shifting her arms to return the hug. "It was all you. You're the one who brought me back."
...你这傻瓜，" 明日香轻声说着，调整双臂回拥对方。"全靠你，是你让我回来的。

It took a while longer before they returned to their rooms.
他们过了好一阵子才各自回到房间。

XXX

Morning came. 清晨到来了。

Shinji honestly couldn't tell if he'd slept at all when he got out of bed. It both felt like he'd spent six hours staring at the ceiling, and that he'd blinked once and light had suddenly been peeking into his room. Either way, one single thought was centre stage in his mind, leaving no room for anything else.
真嗣实在无法确定自己是否真的睡了。他感觉要么是盯着天花板发了六个小时的呆，要么就是一眨眼间，晨光便悄然溜进了房间。不管怎样，他的脑海里只有一个念头占据着主导，其他一切都无法介入。

Mum... is in Unit-01? 妈妈...是在 01 单元吗？

Shinji stretched his arms out wide, then rubbed the sleep crud out of his eyes and left his bedroom. Sliding the door open, he could hear Asuka moving about in the kitchen. He murmured a greeting and got one in return just as he stepped into the bathroom.
真嗣伸了个懒腰，揉掉眼角的睡意，走出卧室。推开滑门，厨房里传来明日香忙碌的声响。他轻声问候，对方也回应了一声，接着他便走进了浴室。

It was something so incredibly hard to believe, considering he'd spent the last ten years believing Mum was dead yet not even knowing how she had died. But now Asuka's... theory? shed new light on the matter. It was just so damn annoying that Shinji couldn't even attempt to think back to the last time he'd seen his mother without getting, hah, the mother of all headaches.
考虑到他过去十年一直坚信母亲已故，却连她的死因都不清楚，这件事实在令人难以置信。然而，明日香的...理论？为这一谜团投下了新的光芒。真让人烦躁，真嗣甚至无法回忆起上次见到母亲的情形，而不感到，哈，那种剧烈的头痛。

His father definitely knew the whole story. And according to him, Yui Ikari's death had made Shinji's mind repress almost every detail around the time. The first solid memory he could pinpoint was standing at a train station.
他的父亲无疑知晓整个故事。据他所言，绫波零的去世使得真嗣的记忆几乎屏蔽了那段时期的全部细节。他最早能明确回忆起的场景，是站在火车站的那一刻。

Shinji washed and dried his hands, then headed back into the kitchen. The coffee machine was just finished filling up a cup, which Asuka collected and set down on the opposite side of the kitchen table; Shinji nodded in understanding and sat down.
碇真嗣洗净并擦干双手后，回到厨房。咖啡机正好完成一杯咖啡的制作，明日香将其端起，放在餐桌的另一侧；碇真嗣点头示意，随即坐下。

"I know you don't much care for it but you look about as tired as I feel," said Asuka.
"我知道你对此不太感冒，但你看起来和我一样疲惫，"阿苏卡说道。

Powering through the bitterness, Shinji gave a mumbled agreement as he took a sip. There were so many questions he wanted to ask, but he didn't even know who he could turn to. Only the higher-ups at NERV would have any idea, and they'd all apparently decided that he didn't need to know. Even his own father would just kick him out of his giant gloomy office instead of revealing anything useful. For now, all he could do was press on.
忍受着苦涩，真嗣含糊地应了一声，抿了一口。他心中疑问重重，却不知该向谁求助。只有 NERV 的高层可能知晓答案，但他们似乎一致认为他无需了解。就连自己的父亲也只会将他赶出那间阴沉的巨大办公室，不透露半点有用信息。此刻，他唯有继续前进。

"Do you know of any way we could... confirm that our mothers are in our Evas?" Shinji finally asked after minutes of awkward silence. Asuka frowned at him; he wasn't sure if it was just out of early-morning confusion or if she thought he'd backflipped on his belief of her actually meeting her mother. "Something we could do to talk to them? Face-to-face, so to speak?"
你知道有什么办法能...确认我们的母亲是否真的在 Evas 里吗？" 经过几分钟尴尬的沉默，真嗣终于开口。明日香皱眉看着他，他不确定这是因为清晨的迷茫，还是她觉得他否定了她确实见过母亲的信念。"有没有什么办法能让我们与她们直接对话？就像面对面那样？

Asuka blinked, then looked thoughtfully away. "The only thing I can think of right now is getting absorbed into the Eva, since that's what happened to me, but that's not a feasible plan."
明日香眨了眨眼，随后若有所思地移开视线。“眼下我能想到的，只有被 Eva 同化这一条路，毕竟我有过那样的经历，但这并非切实可行的方案。”

Silence fell again as Shinji and Asuka slowly drank their coffee.
寂静再次笼罩，真嗣和明日香缓缓品味着各自的咖啡。

"Alright," said Shinji, tapping his chin in thought. "Now that you know your mother's in Unit-02, has there been any point in the past where you had any sort of... sense that she was with you?"
那么，" 碇真嗣边说边轻敲下巴沉思，"既然你知道你母亲在二号机中，过去是否有过某个瞬间，你感觉到她的陪伴？

"Uh..." Her gaze drifting skyward, Asuka's face scrunched up in concentration as she went back over her time in Unit-02. A knock on the front door interrupted her thoughts. This early in the morning, it could really only be one person.
"嗯..." 明日香的目光飘向天空，眉头紧锁，全神贯注地回忆着她在二号机的经历。突然，前门的敲击声打断了她的思绪。这么早，能来的恐怕只有一个人。

"Come in, Rei!" Shinji called out. There was no need to get up to let their fellow pilot in; Rei was free to enter their apartment whenever she wished, so she would have Misato's copy of their keycard.
"进来吧，绫波！" 真嗣招呼道。无需起身迎接，绫波随时可凭美里给的钥匙卡副本自由进出他们的公寓。

"Good morning," Rei greeted as she came into the kitchen. She stopped, her eyes flicking between the two of them. "Is... something the matter? You both seem rather distressed."
早上好，" 蕾依走进厨房时问候道。她停了下来，目光在两人之间游移。"是不是出了什么事？你们俩看起来似乎很不安。

Shinji and Asuka stared at each other, talking without talking. He wanted to tell Rei what they had just discovered but Asuka, despite their close friendship, was leery of speaking about something so vitally -and personally- important to both of them. Shinji felt that Rei might actually have a clue to their current conundrum, given her long experience with Evangelion. Asuka raised an eyebrow at that, but Shinji refused to back down. Finally, she relented with a low, irritated groan.
碇真嗣与明日香默默对视，彼此心照不宣。他本想向绫波丽透露他们的新发现，但即便与明日香交情深厚，她对于涉及两人切身且重要的话题仍显得谨慎。碇真嗣认为，凭借绫波丽在 EVA 领域的深厚经验，她或许能洞察他们所面临的难题。明日香对此挑眉表示怀疑，但碇真嗣坚持己见。最终，她无奈地低声抱怨，勉强接受了。

Without doing something so blatantly suicidal as gloating, Shinji turned back to Rei only to see that their friend was smiling serenely at them. She swiftly hid the smile as she noticed their attention back on her.
真嗣并未做出那种明显的自毁行为来炫耀，他转头看向绫波，却见她正平静地对着他们微笑。察觉到他们的目光再次聚焦，她迅速将笑容藏了起来。

"We have a... concern," Asuka said, surprising Shinji. He was expecting to have to be the one to broach the subject. "It's to do with our Evas."
我们有个...担忧，" 明日香开口道，让真嗣颇感意外。他原以为得自己先挑起这个话题。"是关于我们的 Eva 的。

"I do not recall any ongoing technical issues being reported," Rei replied as she sat down at the kitchen table.
"我不记得有任何持续的技术问题被报告，" 蕾伊回答着，同时坐到了厨房的桌子旁。

"Not that kind of concern," said Asuka with a shake of her head. "More... to do with us and them."
不是那种担忧，" 明日香摇头说，"主要是我们和他们之间的问题。

"I see." Rei's face went serious, like Shinji had seen many times before through the comm system during a battle. "What is it that you are hoping to achieve?"
我明白了。" 绫波的面容变得严肃，正如真嗣在战斗中通过通讯系统多次所见。"你究竟希望实现什么？

Shinji sensed Asuka's hesitation and immediately stepped in. "Last night, Asuka woke up and remembered something important about her time within Unit-02. She-" He cut himself off, glancing at the redhead in question for confirmation and receiving the smallest of nods. "She saw her mother."
真嗣察觉到明日香的迟疑，立刻上前解围。"昨晚，明日香醒来，回忆起她在二号机内的一段重要往事。她——"他话未说完，便看向那位红发少女以确认，得到了她微不可察的点头。"她见到了自己的母亲。"

Rei stared at them for several uncomfortably long seconds. "I see," she murmured quietly. "And I am not surprised; eventually you would have realised that the Evas have souls. After all, you must open your heart to your Eva in order to synchronise."
绫波凝视着他们，沉默了许久。“我明白了，”她轻声说道，“这并不意外；你们终究会意识到，EVA 是有灵魂的。毕竟，要与 EVA 同步，你们必须敞开心扉。”

"Open..." Shinji began. "开始吧..." 真嗣开口道。

"...our heart..." Asuka continued.
"...我们内心深处..." 明日香接着说。

"...to our Eva?" they both finished echoing together.
"对我们亲爱的伊娃又如何呢？"两人齐声说道。

That tiny hint of a smile returned to Rei's face for a split second before fleeing once more. "Yes, and I am afraid that is all the advice I can give you."
那一抹微笑在绫的脸上闪现了一瞬，又迅速隐去。“是的，恐怕我能提供的建议仅止于此。”

"...Uh." Asuka tapped a finger against her chin and then shrugged. "What do you even mean by that? I've been synchronising with Unit-02 for years, what exactly am I supposed to do differently now?"
...嗯。" 明日香用手指轻敲下巴，随后耸肩道："你这话究竟什么意思？我跟二号机同步都这么多年了，现在是要我做些什么改变吗？

"I have confidence that you will be able to understand soon enough," Rei cryptically replied.
"我相信你不久就能明白，" Rei 神秘地回应。

Asuka stared at her for a moment, one eyebrow raised, before shrugging and heading over to the fridge to begin preparing breakfast. "Any preferences, Wondergirl?"
明日香凝视了她片刻，眉头微挑，随后耸了耸肩，走向冰箱准备早餐。“神奇女孩，有什么特别想吃的吗？”

Rei shook her head. "I will be happy with whatever you make," she replied. "Excuse me for a moment, I left a couple of your dishes next door."
丽摇摇头说：“你做的我都喜欢。”她接着说：“不好意思，我得离开一会儿，我把你的几个盘子忘在隔壁了。”

"...One day I'll get her to make an actual request instead of just accepting anything," Asuka remarked as soon as the front door closed, huffing and opening the fridge to take out the ingredients she would need.
"...总有一天我会让她提出一个具体的请求，而不是随便接受任何东西，" 明日香在门关上后立刻说道，她嘟囔着，打开冰箱取出所需食材。

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her back. It sounded like an odd goal, but he was not about to point it out. It was possible that she had simply taken a liking to cooking after 'having' to start preparing meals for him.
真嗣对着她的背影挑了挑眉，觉得这个目标颇为奇特，但他并未明言。或许，自从开始为他准备餐食后，她便对烹饪产生了兴趣。

And he rather liked actually being able to taste food again.
他其实很享受能再次尝到食物的真实味道。

Some time after breakfast, when the three pilots were sitting in the lounge room watching television, Shinji's phone began to ring. He pulled it out and looked at the screen; it wasn't NERV, but the number was familiar. Unable to quite recall who it belonged to, he flipped the phone open to answer. "Hello?"
早餐过后一段时间，三位飞行员在休息室里看电视时，真嗣的手机突然响起。他掏出手机一看，屏幕上显示的并非 NERV 的号码，却颇为眼熟。他一时记不起是谁，便接通了电话。“喂？”

"Hey, Shin-man!" 嘿，信哥！

Oh, of course. it was Toji's number. "Ah, hello Toji. How are you?"
哦，对了，这是东司的电话。"啊，东司，你好吗？"

"Eh, alright I guess. Christmas was kinda boring without you and Ken around though. Ended up goin' to see my sister for the day. Not like she can leave the hospital, ya know?"
嗯，也就那样吧。圣诞节你和肯不在，感觉挺没劲的。最后还是去看了我妹妹，她离不开医院，你懂的。

"Sorry about that." Shinji glanced at Asuka, who remained focused on the television. "But hey, I at least have a bit of good news."
抱歉。" 碇真嗣看了看明日香，她正全神贯注地盯着电视。"不过，我至少有个好消息。

"Ya do?! What, is Ken gonna be okay?"
真的吗？那 Ken 不会有事吧？

Shinji winced at the excited tone of voice. He really did not want to dash his friend's hopes. "No, but Asuka and Rei were cleared to leave yesterday."
听到朋友兴奋的语气，真嗣不禁皱了皱眉。他实在不忍心打击对方的希望。"没有，不过明日香和绫波昨天已经获准离开了。"

"...Oh. I mean, that's cool, man. Tell 'em I'm glad they're back. But, uh... you heard anythin' about Ken?"
...哦，我是说，那真不错，伙计。告诉他们我很高兴他们回来了。不过，呃...你有没有听到肯的什么消息？

"Nothing new, I'm afraid. Can't talk about anything over the phone either." Shinji glanced at Asuka again, who was now side-eyeing him. He raised an eyebrow, jerked his head towards his phone, and mouthed 'tell him?'. Asuka turned her head to stare at him, arms folded. Shinji thought swiftly and then added, 'Hikari too?'. Her eyes widened slightly, and she huffed and flapped a hand at him before turning back to the television.
"恐怕没什么新进展。电话里也不便多说。" 真嗣再次瞥向明日香，她正斜眼打量着他。他挑了挑眉，朝手机示意，无声地问'要告诉他吗？'。明日香转过头来，双臂抱胸，直视着他。真嗣迅速思索后，又加了一句，'也包括光吗？'。她眼中闪过一丝惊讶，轻哼一声，挥手示意他别管，随后又转回去看电视。

"But, um... hey, enough about that for now," Shinji said into his phone, giving the slightest of smiles to the side of Asuka's head. "We haven't seen each other for a while now. Wanna meet somewhere and... catch up? You could bring Class Rep too, I'm sure Asuka wants to see her again too."
不过，嗯...嘿，先不提那些了，" 碇真嗣对着手机说，向明日香的侧脸投去一丝微笑。"我们好久没见了。要不要找个地方聚聚，好好聊聊？你也可以叫上班长，我想明日香也很想再见到她。

There was a long pause. Shinji hoped his unspoken message got through.
沉默良久。真嗣期盼着，他那未曾言明的心意能够被理解。

"Yeah, that sounds cool, dude. I'll ring Hikari to let 'er know. Wanna meet at that arcade on Nakamichi Street in an hour?"
确实挺酷的，哥们。我这就给光打电话通知她。一小时后在中道街的游戏厅碰头怎么样？

"Sounds good. See you then."
好的，到时候见。

The moment his phone closed, Asuka snorted. "So you're gonna blab classified intel, are you?"
他刚挂掉电话，明日香便嗤笑道：“怎么，你要泄露机密不成？”

Shinji sighed. "Those three have been friends since they started school together. It may be bad news but they deserve to know what's going on."
真嗣叹息道：“那三人自打一起上学起就是好友。这消息虽糟，但他们理应知晓实情。”

"Oh I would have told Hikari myself the next time I met her anyway. I just kinda felt like vegging out here after what we've just been through. Don't forget, most of what happened was only a couple days ago from my perspective." Asuka gave an expansive shrug. "But I suppose I'll join you."
哦，我原本就打算下次见到光时亲自告诉她。刚经历那些事，我只是想在这里稍微放松一下。别忘了，从我的视角来看，这些事不过才过去几天。" 明日香宽慰地耸了耸肩，"不过我想我还是会跟你一起去的。

The bright red arcade really stood out among the more drab buildings surrounding it; the only thing close to matching it in gaudiness was a fast food place further along the street. There were quite a few people already inside the arcade, including a couple of men in serious dark suits competing against each other in some sort of racing game. At first Shinji thought they were Section Two, having rushed ahead to keep the pilots under surveillance, but as he passed by them he could see that they weren't wearing earpieces.
那家鲜红色的游戏厅在周围灰暗的建筑中显得格外抢眼；唯一能与之相提并论的是街对面的一家快餐店。游戏厅内已有不少人，其中两位身着严肃深色西装的男士正在一款赛车游戏中激烈对决。起初，真嗣以为他们是第二部门的人，提前赶来监视驾驶员，但当他经过他们时，注意到他们并未佩戴耳机。

Horaki spotted them first, waving hello to the pilots and then beckoning them over to a cabinet where Toji was pointing a light gun at the screen. He gave a quick sideways glance and a nod at them before returning his attention to the game.
堀崎最先注意到他们，向飞行员们挥手打招呼，接着招手让他们过来，东治正在柜子旁手持光枪对着屏幕。他迅速地向他们瞥了一眼并点头示意，随即又将目光转回游戏。

"Oh it's so good to see you all again!" Horaki exuberantly greeted them. "I was so worried when you didn't come back to school after the battle."
哦，再次见到大家真是太好了！" 小鸟游热情地迎接他们。"你们战斗后没回学校，我可担心了。

"Yeah... we won but took a major hammering in the process," replied Asuka. "I'll tell you all about it shortly." She eyed the game Toji was playing as he growled and reached into his pocket. "First though, I wanna unwind a bit by schooling Stefan here."
嗯...虽然我们赢了，但过程相当惨烈，"飞鸟回应道。"稍后我会详细告诉你。"她瞥了一眼户木正在玩的游戏，他低吼一声，伸手去口袋里摸索。"不过在此之前，我想先通过教训斯特凡来放松一下。

Toji shoved a coin into the machine, ready to try again-
透二把一枚硬币投入机器，准备再试一次

"Player two, ready!" announced the machine as Asuka stepped up and put her own coin in.
"玩家二，准备就绪！"机器宣告，明日香随即上前，投入了自己的硬币。

Horaki took a step back towards Rei and Shinji. "Won't this be... kind of one-sided?" she whispered to them while watching the action.
小鸟游后退一步，靠近绫波和真嗣，低声问道：“这样会不会……显得太一边倒了？”她一边说着，一边注视着战况。

Shinji shrugged. "Asuka's been training for ten years. She definitely has an advantage, even if it's not an Eva's control system."
真嗣耸耸肩说："明日香训练了十年，她肯定有优势，即便那不是 Eva 的操控系统。"

Horaki quirked an eyebrow at him. "And what about you? Could you hold your own against her?"
堀木挑眉望向他，问道："你又如何？能和她一较高下吗？"

"Um..." A shudder ran through Shinji's body as he recalled the training from hell Asuka had put him through. "...Maybe not just yet..."
"呃...” 真嗣一想到明日香给他安排的地狱式训练，就不禁打了个寒颤。“...或许还不是时候...”

Asuka's hands shot into the air in victory a minute later, as she turned to stare menacingly at Toji. He snarled and reached into his pocket, only to come up empty. "Damnit," he spat as he ran off. "Lemme go get more coins!"
一分钟后，明日香得意地举起双手，转头凶狠地瞪着东治。他咆哮一声，伸手去口袋里摸索，却一无所获。“该死，”他咒骂着，拔腿就跑。“我去再拿些硬币！”

"I shall deal with her," Rei quietly stated, stepping up to the machine Toji had abandoned and picking up the discarded light gun. She took a moment to aim down the sights before glancing at Asuka. "My turn."
我来对付她，"绫波丽平静地宣布，走向东治丢下的机器，捡起地上的光枪。她稍作瞄准后，向明日香示意。"该我了。

This time the competition was much closer and lasted a lot longer. Both girls had been essentially raised by NERV, trained to fight for the future of humanity. Toji came back to find Asuka and Rei still going at it, neither of them willing to concede an inch. Their styles were greatly different though; Asuka would move rapidly from cover to cover, hosing the area in front of her with bullets, and Rei would jump from one corner of the map to the other as her opponent got too close, taking careful aim and firing only one or two shots at a time.
此次较量异常胶着，持续时间颇长。两位少女均由 NERV 培养，为守护人类未来而接受战斗训练。东治归来时，见明日香与绫波依旧激战正酣，双方均寸步不让。她们的战术风格迥异：明日香疾速转移阵地，向四周密集扫射；绫波则是在对手逼近时灵活跃迁至地图另一角，精准瞄准后才谨慎开火，每次仅射出一两发子弹。

In the end though, there could only be one winner.
归根结底，赢家只有一个。

"Scheiße!" Asuka cursed as her character exploded into a cloud of pixels. She shoved the gun back into its holster on the machine and turned to Rei. "Well you're certainly living up to your nickname, Wondergirl."
"Scheiße!" Asuka 咒骂一声，她的角色瞬间化为一片像素。她将枪插回机器上的枪套，转头对 Rei 说：“看来你真不愧是‘奇迹女孩’。”

Rei gave a slight tilt of her head. "Thank you, Asuka. It was very close though; if we had time for more rounds I believe we would both score around the same number of victories."
绫微微侧头，微笑道：“谢谢你，明日香。其实比分很接近；若能多赛几轮，我想我们胜负次数会不相上下。”

"I kinda wanna see you both play that other shooting game over there," Toji remarked, hooking a thumb over his shoulder at another machine. "The way you two did against each other here, you'd probably smash that game's co-op."
我挺想看你们俩去玩那边那个射击游戏，" Toji 说着，用拇指朝身后另一台机器示意。"看你们刚才的对决，估计合作模式里也能大显身手。

"Hah, we get enough teamwork as it is," replied Asuka with a smirk. "But Misato doesn't give us much time these days to beat up on each other in the simulators."
哈，我们现在的团队协作已经够充分了，"飞鸟带着一丝坏笑回应。"不过最近美里没怎么给我们时间在模拟器里互相切磋。

"Thank the gods for that," Shinji murmured in relief, flinching slightly as Asuka gave him a devious look.
"多亏了神明，" 真嗣如释重负地低语，因明日香投来的狡猾目光而微微一缩。

"Well anyway, ya wanna chat here or go somewhere else?" asked Toji.
"那么，你是想在这儿聊，还是换个地方？" Toji 问道。

"Wait." All eyes turned to Rei, who was staring at a machine in the corner. "Is that... a fishing game?" She walked towards it before anybody else could answer.
"等等。"大家的目光都集中到了 Rei 身上，她正凝视着角落里的一台机器。"那是...钓鱼游戏机吗？"她边说边走了过去，没等其他人回应。

An expression of disbelief crossed Asuka's face. "...Guess that answers that."
明日香脸上闪过一丝难以置信的神情。"...看来这已经回答了问题。"

"Shit, is he gonna be okay?" Toji asked after Shinji and Asuka relayed the events of the last Angel battle to him and Hikari. The class representative had gone white-faced in horror, latching onto Toji's arm as Shinji described the state Kensuke was currently in. Rei was focused on the game, but Shinji had seen her twitch slightly as he talked about how she had had to fight Kensuke's Evangelion.
"他不会有事吧？" 东治在真嗣和明日香向他及光讲述了上一次与使徒的战斗后焦急地问道。班长听得面色惨白，紧紧抓住东治的手臂，而真嗣正描述着健介目前的状况。零虽然专注于游戏，但真嗣提到她不得不与健介的福音战士交战时，她似乎有些动容。

"We really don't know," Shinji grimly replied. "NERV says they've been trying everything they can, but nothing's changed. They can't even try to cut the biomass off because it seems to have fused into his body."
我们确实一无所知，" 真嗣严肃地回应。"NERV 表示他们已竭尽所能，但情况依旧如故。他们甚至无法尝试移除那些生物组织，因为它们似乎已与他的身体融为一体。

"God... damnit..." 天哪...真该死...

Toji punched the side of the cabinet Rei was using, his face like thunder. Horaki, on the other hand, looked like she was just barely holding back tears. Shinji mentally grimaced, remembering again what he'd learned from Horaki before Asuka's birthday. She, Toji and Kensuke had known each other since they had first started school together; almost nine years, about as long as he had known Asuka.
冬二狠狠地捶打了零所用的柜子，面色阴沉如雷。洞木则似乎在极力忍住泪水。真嗣心中一紧，再次忆起在明日香生日之前从洞木那里听来的往事。她、冬二和剑介自幼便是同窗，相识近九年，与他和明日香的交情相当。

He glanced at her out of the corner of her eye. There was no doubt in Shinji's mind that he would have a similar reaction as his friends if something happened to Asuka. He blinked, then guiltily amended that to 'if something happened to Asuka or Rei'. Of course, the two of them had already been in great peril before, death creeping closer each time, but they had managed to survive until now.
他偷偷地用眼角瞟了她一眼。真嗣心里清楚，如果明日香遭遇不测，他肯定也会像朋友们那样反应。他眨了眨眼，随后带着愧疚感更正道：“如果明日香或绫波出了什么事。”确实，她们俩之前已多次面临生死危机，每次都险些丧命，但她们都挺了过来。

Asuka, likely having sensed his mood, gave him a quick glance. He brushed it off with a wave of his hand, but he knew she was still curious about what he was thinking.
明日香或许感知到了他的心情，快速地瞟了他一眼。他挥手示意无事，但心里清楚，她对他的想法依旧充满好奇。

And of course now they both knew that, for whatever arcane reason, their mothers were... integrated into the Evangelions. But how? And why? Rei knew... something, but had not given them a straight answer. All they could do was wait until NERV decided to let them back into their Evangelions.
自然，如今他们俩都明白，由于某种深奥的原因，他们的母亲被……整合进了福音战士。但究竟是如何做到的？又出于何种目的？绫波知道一些内情，却未曾直言相告。他们唯有静候 NERV 的许可，才能重返自己的福音战士。

The universe seemed to have been eavesdropping; Asuka's phone immediately began ringing. Shinji's hand shot to the pocket his own phone was in, but neither his nor Rei's phones were ringing. The three pilots looked at each other in confusion for a moment before Asuka finally answered the call.
宇宙似乎在暗中窥探；明日香的电话随即响起。真嗣急忙摸向装着自己手机的口袋，然而他和绫波的手机都未响起。三位驾驶员一时面面相觑，最终明日香接起了电话。

"Hello? ... Oh hi Misato, what's up? ... Good news? I'll believe that when I hear it." Her eyes suddenly widened in shock. "Um, okay that would be good news. ... And you want to schedule an activation test for all of us today? ... Yeah, okay. I'll let the others know. See you soon."
喂？...哦，美里啊，什么事？...好消息？我得听你说说。" 她突然瞪大了眼睛，显得很惊讶。"嗯，那确实是好消息。...你想安排我们大家今天做激活测试？...行，知道了。我会通知其他人。待会儿见。

"An activation test?" Shinji echoed as Asuka put her phone away. "I take it they want us over there now?"
是激活测试吗？" 真嗣跟着说，同时明日香把手机收好。"看来他们是要我们现在就过去？

Asuka nodded, then turned to Toji and Horaki. "Sorry, guess we gotta cut this outing short."
明日香点头后，转向东治和博美说：“不好意思，看来我们得提前结束这次活动了。”

"It's alright, Asuka," Horaki replied. "I'm just glad to see you're all safe."
没事的，明日香，" 洞木说，"看到你们都平安无事，我就放心了。

Toji grunted in agreement. "We better let you go now. I think those are your NERV shadows outside."
冬二哼了一声，表示赞同。"我们还是放你走吧，外面那些人，我看是 NERV 派来盯梢的。"

The three pilots waved goodbye to their friends and left the arcade. Just as Toji had said, Section Two was standing right outside waiting for them, beckoning them towards a company vehicle.
三位飞行员向朋友们挥手告别后，离开了游戏厅。正如东治所言，第二部门的人员已在外面等候，正招手让他们前往一辆公司车辆。

"...So what do you think?" Asuka murmured to Shinji, low enough that the agents likely didn't hear them. "Reckon this is our opportunity to find out the truth?"
...那么，你怎么看？" 明日香轻声对真嗣耳语，声音低得特工们或许并未察觉。"这会不会是我们揭开真相的契机？

"Yeah," Shinji quietly replied. "But the question is..."
嗯，" 碇真嗣低声回应。"关键在于...

"How?" they both said together.
他们俩同时问道：“怎么了？”

### Chapter 39 Mama?

Shinji was somewhat surprised when he stepped out of the changing room to find that the hallway was missing a certain redheaded pilot. Normally, Rei and Asuka would have finished before him -she once mentioned something about a 'quick-change'- and Asuka would be waiting outside the male door for him, no matter how fast he got his plugsuit on, perhaps tapping a foot on the ground in impatience. On any other day, he might have done the same to her. Now was definitely not the time, though. Even with how physically far apart they were, separated by a wall, Shinji could feel Asuka's apprehension, her worry, her... fear?
真嗣走出更衣室时，略感意外地发现，走廊上不见了那位红发驾驶员的身影。通常，绫波和明日香会先他一步换好衣服——明日香曾提过所谓的“快速换装”——而她总会守在男更衣室门外，无论他穿插件服的速度多快，或许还会不耐烦地用脚轻敲地面。若在平时，他或许也会如此对她。但此刻绝非寻常。尽管隔着一堵墙，相距甚远，真嗣仍能感受到明日香的紧张、忧虑，甚至是……恐惧？

He gathered his courage and knocked on the female changing room door. A moment later the door slid open, revealing an anxious-looking Asuka. Rei was nowhere in sight; she had likely already left for the command centre. Asuka stood there, one hand still on the door control, and slightly raised an eyebrow. "...Shinji."
他鼓起勇气敲了敲女更衣室的门。不一会儿，门开了，露出神色紧张的明日香。丽已不见踪影，大概已经去了指挥中心。明日香站在门口，一手还搭在门控上，微微挑眉。“...真嗣。”

"Is everything alright?" asked Shinji. It was a stupid question, but he still had to ask it.
"一切都还好吗？" 新二忍不住问道。明知这个问题很傻，但他还是忍不住要问。

"...What do you think?" she retorted huffily. "I'm sure you can sense it; I know right now I'm feeling your concern." She paused, then looked away with a hastily mumbled, "...thanks..."
...你怎么看？"她有些生气地反问，"我相信你能感觉到；我现在确实感受到了你的关心。"她顿了顿，然后转过头，低声说了句，"...谢谢...

Shinji nodded. "You're still worried about how to talk to your mother. I'm guessing you still haven't come up with anything."
真嗣点头道：“看来你还在为如何与母亲沟通而烦恼，估计你还没想出什么好办法吧。”

"Not a damn thing... what about you?"
什么也没有...你呢？

"I'm sorry, but nothing comes to mind." Shinji sighed deeply. "All we have to go on is what Rei told us this morning."
抱歉，我脑子里一片空白。" 真嗣长叹一声。"我们现在仅有的线索就是早上绫波提供的信息。

"Open our heart," they both echoed together.
"敞开心扉，"他们俩齐声说道。

It was such an odd suggestion; an incredibly vague concept. Shinji never felt like he 'opened' anything when synchronising to an Evangelion. It was simply a matter of... of...
这个建议真是匪夷所思，概念模糊至极。真嗣在同步进入福音战士时，从未有过“开启”某物的感觉。那只是一种...一种...

Actually, what was it that he did that allowed him to synchronise? Despite the dozens of times he'd gotten into an entry plug Shinji still didn't precisely know what actually happened to put him in control of the war machines. He had just let the people on the bridge do their thing and went along with it.
实际上，他到底做了什么才得以同步？尽管已多次进入插入栓，真嗣仍未完全明白，究竟是怎样的过程让他能操控这些战斗机械。他只是听从指挥桥上人员的安排，顺其自然地配合。

"Maybe we can work something out when we're actually in an Eva," he suggested. A thought occurred, something that could work as a minor change of subject, and he gave voice to it. "Speaking of which, is something happening with Unit-02? You seemed pretty surprised when Misato called."
或许我们真能驾驶 Eva 时想出对策," 他提议。突然灵光一闪, 想到一个可以转移话题的小点子, 他便开口道: "对了, 二号机那边是不是有什么事? Misato 打电话来时, 你看起来挺吃惊的。

Asuka's face lit up. "Oh! Right!" she exclaimed, already looking much happier. "Your old man apparently got those whatever-Committee guys to back off. Unit-02 won't be getting put on ice!"
明日香的脸庞顿时明亮起来。“哦！对啊！”她惊喜地喊道，立刻显得心情大好。“看来你父亲让那些委员会的人退缩了。二号机不会被冷藏了！”

Shinji didn't need any sort of synchronisation to know just how exuberant she was at the news. "That's... that's great news!" he replied with a smile. "And it does make sense, after all we lost Unit-03 in the last fight, and who knows what will happen in the next fight?"
真嗣无需任何同步便能感知到她对这消息的欣喜若狂。"那真是...太棒了！"他笑着回应，"而且这确实合情合理，毕竟上一场战斗我们失去了 03 号机，下一场战斗会怎样，谁又能预料呢？"

"Exactly!" Asuka finally stepped out of the changing room doorway and began to head down the corridor. "So what if my Eva somehow got its own S2 Engine? That'll only make things better for us!"
没错！"明日香终于走出更衣室，开始沿着走廊前进。"就算我的 Eva 装上了 S2 引擎又怎样？那只会让我们更有优势！

"Well, I can sort of understand their concerns," Shinji admitted as he hurried to catch up. "I mean, it came from an Angel. It could cause all sorts of problems."
嗯，我多少能理解他们的顾虑，" 真嗣加快脚步赶上时承认道，"毕竟它源自使徒，可能会带来各种麻烦。

"It's been over two weeks now," Asuka retorted. "If anything was going to happen, it would have by now. Especially with people poking my Eva all over."
已经两周多了，" 明日香反驳说，"如果真有什么事，现在早该发生了，尤其是大家都在不停地触碰我的 Eva。

Shinji had to concede that point. By then, they had reached the command centre anyway.
真嗣只好承认这一点。此时，他们已抵达指挥中心。

"Afternoon, kids," Misato said by way of greeting from where she was standing by the three bridge officers. Rei wasn't here either. Doctor Akagi glanced up from Lieutenant Ibuki's screen and gave them a short nod. "Just a couple things to go over before you get into your Evas."
下午好，孩子们，" 葛城美里站在三名舰桥军官旁边，以此作为问候。绫波也不在场。赤木博士从伊吹二尉的屏幕上抬起头，向他们简短地点了点头。"在你们进入 EVA 之前，有几件事情需要确认一下。

"I'm sure you're excited about the S2 Engine Unit-02 now has," said Doctor Akagi. "But for now it's remaining offline. I still don't entirely trust it and neither does the Committee."
赤木博士说：'我相信你现在对 S2 引擎单元 02 的新功能感到兴奋，但目前它将继续保持离线。我和委员会都还没有完全信任它。'

"Sooo... we have an infinite battery for our war machine that we're not allowed to use. That makes absolutely perfect sense," said Asuka, sarcasm dripping from her words.
"这么说吧...我们给战争机器装了个无限电池，却不让用。这逻辑真是完美无缺，"飞鸟讽刺地说道，话语中满是嘲讽。

"Well first off, it's not an 'infinite' battery," Doctor Akagi testily replied. "While yes, S2 Engines generate theoretically limitless power, there's still an upper limit to how much energy the systems can store. It would still be possible for you to run dry in a combat situation, especially with excessive use of an AT-Field. Secondly, the fact that an Eva has such a power source is not entirely a good thing."
首先，这并非所谓的'无限'电池，"赤木博士有些不耐烦地回应。"尽管 S2 引擎理论上能提供无尽的能量，但系统存储能力仍有极限。在战斗中，尤其是频繁使用 AT 力场时，你仍可能面临能量耗尽的风险。再者，EVA 配备如此强大的能源，也并非全然是件好事。

Misato nodded. "Yeah, remember that the Evas have been known to go berserk in the past. Our only real method of stopping them when that happens is to stall and wait for their power to run out. Can't do that if the rampaging Eva has an S2 Engine." She pointed a finger at Asuka for emphasis. "And that is what's got us worried. So for the time being, the S2 Engine will be offline."
碇真嗣点头表示同意。“没错，别忘了 EVA 以前就有过失控的记录。我们唯一能做的就是在它们失控时尽量拖延，直到它们的能量耗尽。但如果失控的 EVA 搭载了 S2 引擎，我们就束手无策了。”她特意用手指向明日香，加重语气。“这正是我们担忧的点。所以目前，S2 引擎将暂时停用。”

Asuka rolled her eyes, and her head as well, causing both adults to frown at her. "Fine," she grumped. "But apart from that, Unit-02 is back in business, right?"
明日香翻了个白眼，头也扭向一边，惹得两位大人皱眉。“行吧，”她不悦地说，“不过话说回来，二号机已经恢复运作了吧？”

"Indeed," replied Doctor Akagi. "With the total loss of Unit-03, and none of the Mass Production Evas ready yet, Commander Ikari was able to convince the Committee that we need every Eva we could field, regardless of any... unauthorised upgrades they might have."
确实如此，"阿卡吉博士回应说，"鉴于 03 号机体的彻底损毁，加上量产型 Eva 还未就绪，碇司令说服了委员会，我们必须动用所有可用的 Eva，即便它们可能带有未经批准的升级。

"Wait!" Shinji exclaimed. "Mass Production Evas? There's even more of them?"
等等！" 真嗣惊讶地说。"还有更多的量产型 Eva 吗？

Doctor Akagi hesitated for a second, blinking a few times, before responding. "Oh. You must not have heard about them yet. Yes, there are twelve more Evas, dubbed the Mass Production Series, under construction in various countries around the world. Unfortunately they won't be ready until at least halfway through next year."
安吉医生迟疑片刻，眨了眨眼，方才开口：“哦，你大概还没听说吧。没错，还有十二台 Eva，被称为量产型，正在全球多个国家加紧建造。遗憾的是，至少要到明年年中它们才能完工。”

"Now then," Misato interjected. "If there are no more distracting questions? No? Good. Rei's already getting into Unit-00, so head on down to your Evas and let's get this show on the road."
那么，" 葛城美里打断道，"如果没有其他让人分心的问题了？没有吗？太好了。绫波已经进入零号机，你们也快去各自的 Eva 那里，我们准备出发。

Asuka could feel how nervous Shinji was starting to get now, as they drew closer to the Evangelion cages. She placed a hand on his shoulder just as they reached the door, and pulled just barely enough to get him to turn around. "We will work this out," she promised. "We have to, if we're ever going to be able to use our Evas properly again, without being full of doubts."
明日香察觉到真嗣随着接近福音战士的笼子而逐渐紧张起来。当他们抵达门前，她轻触他的肩膀，稍加力道让他转过身来。“我们会解决的，”她承诺道。“我们必须解决，否则我们永远无法摆脱疑虑，正确地使用福音战士。”

Shinji's eyes flicked over to the door for a split second, then he gave her a hesitant nod. She lightly slapped him on the shoulder. "Now look sharp! They're gonna think something's up if we go in there looking like we're scared."
真嗣的目光短暂地瞥向门口，随后犹豫地向她点了点头。她轻拍他的肩膀，提醒道：“打起精神来！要是我们进去时一副害怕的样子，他们会起疑的。”

The door opened, and Asuka strode through first, casually checking the set of her A-10 clips as she passed by Unit-00. Rei was apparently already in the entry plug, so she tossed a casual salute at the cyclopean eye. When they reached the second cage, Shinji turned off to head up the gantry to Unit-01's waiting entry plug, and she gave him a short nod of encouragement which he returned.
门一开，明日香便率先迈步进入，边走边随意地检查着她的 A-10 弹夹，经过零号机时。看来绫波已经进入了插入栓，她便向那独眼巨人般的监视器随意地敬了个礼。到达第二个笼子时，真嗣转向前往初号机等待的插入栓所在的步道，她向他点头以示鼓励，他也回应了。

Now alone, and with the distance increasing between herself and Shinji, some of the anxiety was also dissipating. It was perhaps a good thing that they were doing activation tests and not sync tests, as with their strange mental bond, there was the possibility of a feedback loop occurring. Combine that with the shock of discovering the truth about their mothers or the despair of being proven wrong...
如今孤身一人，随着与真嗣的距离渐行渐远，内心的焦虑也逐渐减轻。或许进行的是激活测试而非同步测试反而是好事，考虑到他们之间奇异的精神纽带，同步测试可能会引发反馈回路。再加上揭开各自母亲真相的冲击，或是被证实错误后的绝望感...

Asuka stared up at Unit-02 as she ascended the gantry. She knew what she experienced was true. It had simply been far too real to be a dream, even a lucid one. However, there was still the faintest, most minute possibility that she was mistaken about Shinji's mother. But she would much rather believe in the good possibility than the bad one.
明日香一边攀登通道，一边仰望着二号机。她确信自己的经历绝非虚幻，真实得绝非梦境，哪怕是清醒梦。尽管如此，她对真嗣母亲的看法仍存有一线极微小的误判可能。但她更愿意相信那一线希望，而非绝望。

Asuka idly wondered what Shinji's mother would think of her son's relationship with her, and almost immediately felt her face flush as her thoughts turned to what her own mother would say. Well... when she could finally work out how to contact her again of course.
明日香闲着无聊，琢磨着真嗣的妈妈会怎么看她俩的关系，一想到这，脸颊就不自觉地热了起来，心里也嘀咕起自己妈妈会怎么说。不过...得先想办法再联系上妈妈才行。

She stepped into the entry plug and took her seat as the bridge crew ran through the startup sequence. LCL rushed into the plug and she took a deep breath just before it reached her neck then ducked her head underneath, swiftly expelled the breath and replaced it with a lungful of the orange liquid. Despite her long experience, the LCL still felt uncomfortably heavy in her chest.
她步入插入栓，坐定后，舰桥人员开始执行启动序列。LCL 迅速灌入，她在液面触及颈部前深吸一口气，紧接着低头潜入，迅速呼出空气，改吸满肺的橙色液体。即便经验老到，LCL 在胸腔内的沉重感依旧令人不适。

Or was that just her nervousness again?
或许那只是她又一次的紧张表现？

Asuka brought up a hand to gently rub against her collarbone. Or rather, the necklace that was resting at that exact spot. Some of her unease dissipated as she felt the sapphire press into her skin. Normally she wouldn't have risked damaging such a beautiful thing by potentially exposing it to LCL, but she'd found herself hesitating in the change room when it came time to remove it from around her neck. Instead, she had carefully slipped it under the collar of her plugsuit before activating it, hoping the seal was enough to protect Shinji's gift.
明日香抬起手，轻抚着锁骨处，准确来说，是那条恰好垂挂于此的项链。随着蓝宝石触碰到肌肤，她的不安稍稍缓解。平日里，她绝不会冒险让如此精美的饰品接触到可能损害它的 LCL，但在更衣室准备摘下项链时，她却犹豫了。最终，她小心翼翼地将项链藏入插入栓服的领口内，启动装备，期盼密封性能足以守护真嗣赠予的这份礼物。

The comm system crackled to life, and Misato began speaking. "Alright, we'll be doing Rei's test first, since we anticipate no problems there. She will then be moved to overwatch for Shinji, and then the two of them will be overwatch for Asuka's test, in case of something going wrong."
通信系统突然启动，美里开始讲话：“好了，我们先进行绫波的测试，预计那里不会出现问题。测试完成后，她将转移到真嗣的监视岗位，之后他们两人将负责监视明日香的测试，以防万一出现差错。”

Of course. They were now suspicious of Unit-02, as if a ten year Evangelion veteran would end up being completely incompetent at keeping things together. Asuka gritted her teeth and growled softly at the lack of trust. Soon, though, the usual technical jargon for synchronisation came through over the comm and she focused her mind on the task at hand.
自然。他们开始怀疑二号机，似乎一个经验丰富的十年 EVA 驾驶员会突然变得无法掌控一切。明日香紧咬牙关，对这种不信任感到愤怒。不久，通讯中传来了同步操作的常规技术术语，她随即集中精力应对眼前的任务。

Rei's test went off without a hitch, as was to be expected. But then again, she hadn't had to put up with any weird Evangelion business. Recently at least.
丽的测试顺利完成，一如预期。不过，她最近至少没有遭遇任何与福音战士有关的奇怪事情。

Unit-00 was quickly moved into position, and Asuka used that downtime to quietly open a comm channel to Unit-01. She and Shinji simply looked at each other through the screen. Nothing needed to be said aloud; they could see it in each other's eyes.
零号机迅速就位，绫波趁机悄悄接通了与初号机的通讯。她和真嗣透过屏幕默默相望，无需言语，眼神已诉说一切。

'Good luck.' '祝你好运。'

'Thank you.' '感谢你。'

"Beginning Unit-01 activation test!"
启动单元-01 激活测试！

The comm channel remained open. Shinji broke eye contact to focus on the test, but Asuka kept her full attention on him.
通信频道一直开着。真嗣为了专心测试而移开了目光，但明日香却始终目不转睛地注视着他。

"Initiating first stage connections."
开始建立第一阶段的连接。

"Transmitting pulse." 正在发送脉冲。

"Graph readout normal." 图表显示正常。

She watched as Shinji frowned in concentration for a moment, before relaxing and closing his eyes.
她注视着，真嗣先是皱起眉头，全神贯注，随后放松下来，闭上了双眼。

"Full nerve link established."
神经链接已完全建立。

"Harmonics are normal." 谐波属于正常现象。

"Approaching absolute borderline..."
逼近绝对极限……

His face began twitching.
他的面部开始不由自主地抽动。

"Uh, we're getting some slight variances in the pilot's brainwaves."
嗯，飞行员的脑电波出现了一些细微的变化。

"Shinji, please focus." 真嗣，请专心点。

Asuka lightly scoffed. Shinji most certainly already was focusing. Just not exactly on what they wanted. A minute passed, with the bridge crew eventually debating whether to stop and try again. Before they could make up their minds, two things happened in the space of a second.
明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。真嗣无疑已在集中精神，只不过并非专注于他们所期望的。时间过去了一分钟，舰桥上的船员们开始讨论是否该停下来重新尝试。然而，在他们做出决定前，一秒之内发生了两件事。

Shinji's eyes shot open; his expression one of pure shock. At the same time, somebody in the command centre called out that the activation was successful, but Asuka wasn't interested in that. She leaned forward in her seat, trying to catch Shinji's attention as he took several unnecessary deep breaths. He blinked rapidly for a few seconds, before turning his gaze to the comm screen. Asuka raised an eyebrow, and he responded with an ever-so-slight nod of the head, his eyes still wide open.
真嗣的眼睛突然睁大，脸上写满了惊愕。此时，指挥中心传来激活成功的呼声，但明日香对此置若罔闻。她身体前倾，试图捕捉到正在做着多余深呼吸的真嗣的目光。他快速眨了几下眼，随后将视线转向通讯屏幕。明日香挑起眉毛，他则以几乎察觉不到的点头回应，双眼依旧睁得溜圆。

That confirmed it then. Shinji's mother was in Unit-01, and he had somehow managed to contact her. The only question was how-
这就确认无疑了。碇真嗣的母亲确实在初号机内，而他竟然设法与她取得了联系。现在只剩下一个问题：他是怎么做到的？

...Of course Shinji heard the unspoken question. He raised a hand to his throat, seemingly casually tugging at the neck of his plugsuit as if to adjust it, but his pinkie finger tapped several times on his chest.
...自然，真嗣察觉到了那未言明的疑问。他抬起手，看似不经意地扯了扯自己的插入栓服领口，实则小指在胸前轻敲了几下。

Right around where the necklace was resting.
项链就放在那儿附近。

Asuka fought the urge to touch that spot again. Shinji had somehow managed to work out that she was wearing the necklace for the test, and was using it as... a sort of signal? At this point what little of their mental synchronisation there was seemed to fizzle out as the bridge crew shut Unit-01 down in preparation for moving. The comm link was still open, but neither of them wanted to say a word for fear of alerting NERV to what they were attempting.
明日香极力抑制住再次触碰那处的冲动。不知怎的，真嗣察觉到她为了测试戴着那条项链，并将其作为某种信号使用。此刻，他们之间微弱的精神同步随着桥上人员为移动零号机而关闭，似乎就此中断。通讯线路虽仍畅通，但两人都因害怕惊动 NERV 而选择沉默。

One of Shinji's eyes twitched a little, and the hand that was adjusting his collar moved to his ear and scratched a few times. Again, the pinkie finger tapped away, this time against the side of his head.
真嗣的一只眼睛微微抽动，原本在整理衣领的手移向耳朵，抓挠了几下。接着，他的小指再次轻敲，这次是敲打在头的侧边。

Slumping back in her seat with folded arms, Asuka outwardly projected the appearance of a bored and impatient pilot, but her mind was mulling things over. The necklace... and her head. It didn't seem to make much sense. How would thinking about Shinji's mother's jewellery help?
她双臂交叉，颓然靠在座位上，表面上显得既无聊又焦躁，但内心却在反复思索。那条项链……还有她的头。这似乎没什么意义。琢磨真嗣母亲的珠宝又能有什么帮助呢？

The realisation hit her like a slap across the back of the head. The necklace itself had nothing to do with anything; Shinji was just trying to do the best he could with what little he had available.
她恍然大悟，仿佛后脑勺被人猛拍了一下。那条项链其实与事情无关，真嗣只是竭尽所能，利用手头有限的资源去应对。

Mother. Think. 妈妈，想想吧。

Think about mother. 思考一下母亲。

Could it really be that simple?
真的会这么简单吗？

If Asuka hadn't been sitting in a metal tube, she would have been pacing back and forth while waiting oh-so-patiently for the bridge crew to get sorted out for her test. But finally, they began their litany for the third time and Asuka set her mind to work.
倘若明日香并非身处金属舱内，她定会耐心地来回踱步，等待舰桥人员为她安排好测试。最终，他们第三次重复流程，明日香随即全神贯注地投入工作。

"Initiating first stage connections."
开始建立第一阶段的连接。

Mama.

"Transmitting pulse." 正在发送脉冲。

Mama?

"Graph readout normal." 图表显示正常。

Mama!

"Approaching abbsssoooollllluuuuuuttttttteeeeeeee..."

Asuka blinked. Either the bridge crew had spontaneously gotten incredibly drunk, or-
明日香眨了眨眼。要么是桥上的船员突然间醉得厉害，要么就是——

A hand suddenly landed on her shoulder and she jumped clear out of her seat. When she landed again, her bare feet set down in soft grass under a partly cloudy sky. Asuka put a hand to her chest to try and still her hammering heart, and she turned around to give the intruder a piece of her mind. Her mouth opened... and stayed open as she took in just who it was that had given her a fright.
一只手突然搭在她的肩上，她惊得从座位上一跃而起。落地时，赤足触到了柔软的草地，头顶是半遮半掩的云天。明日香用手捂住胸口，试图安抚那颗狂跳的心，随即转身，打算向那个吓她一跳的人发泄怒气。她张开嘴...却哑然失声，因为她看清了那个让她受惊的人是谁。

"Hello, my darling!" said Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, cheerfully waving a hand in greeting. "How good of you to comed̷̯̲̞̀̉i̴̱̤͗ë̶̖̤́͆͝ ̷̨̟̟͋̋ẘ̸̞̗͚̍͒ì̸̡͎̰̃͝t̸̢̛ḥ̷̂̃͊ ̵̢̐͋m̶̫̙͛e̸̡̙̊̓̍see me again!"
你好，亲爱的！" 绫波丽满面笑容地挥手致意，"真高兴你能再次来看我！

The shock of actually seeing Mama again was swiftly overridden with a horrible sense of unease. She had just been about to run towards her but something froze her feet to the ground. "H-hi... Mama... W-what did you just say?"
再次见到妈妈，震惊之余，一股强烈的不安迅速涌上心头。她本想奔向妈妈，双脚却仿佛被冰封，动弹不得。"妈...妈妈...你...你刚才说什么了？"

Mama tilted her head to the side, giving Asuka a blank look. "Are you feeling alright, darling? I said it was good of you to come see me again."
妈妈侧着头，对飞鸟投去茫然的目光。“宝贝，你没事吧？我说过你能再来见我，真是太好了。”

Asuka vigorously shook her head. Of course that was what Mama had said. She must have just been imagining that second voice. After all, she couldn't remember anything like that happening when she had been absorbed into the core.
明日香猛地摇了摇头。没错，那是妈妈说的。她肯定是幻听了那个第二声音。毕竟，她记不得在被核心融合时有任何类似的情况。

"Yes, I had to make sure what happened was real," she said aloud. "But... what about the people watching over this test?"
是的，我得确认这一切是否真的发生了，"她大声说道。"可是...那些负责监督这次测试的人呢？

"Oh don't worry about that," Mama airily replied. "I made this Eva; I'm the core of this Eva." She hesitated for a brief moment and shrugged. "Admittedly I never expected to become trapped in here, but I'd like to think I made the best of it. Anyway, we'll be fine to talk for at least a couple minutes before I'll have to let you go. I'm not yet sure how long I could shield us from NERV and the multitude of questions they'd have if they knew about this."
哦，那事儿别担心，"妈妈轻描淡写地回应，"这个 Eva 是我造的，我是它的核心。"她顿了一下，耸耸肩，"说真的，我没想到会困在这儿，但我尽力适应了。总之，我们还能聊几分钟，之后我得切断联系。我不确定能瞒着 NERV 多久，他们要是知道了，肯定一堆问题。

Asuka smiled sadly. "I... I see... Guess I better make the most of this then."
明日香苦笑道：“我……我明白了……看来我得充分利用这次机会了。”

As soon as the last word left her mouth, with her legs finally back under her control again she swiftly closed the short distance between them, wrapping her arms around Mama in a fierce, desperate hug. "I can't really remember much of our last conversation, but I... really, really missed you."
她话音刚落，双腿恢复了控制，便疾步上前，紧紧抱住妈妈，那份拥抱充满了迫切与渴望。“我记不太清我们上次聊了什么，但我……真的，真的好想你。”

"Oh... darling..." Mama returned the embrace. "I've been watching you grow up these last ten years, unable to even let you know I was still by your side. The fact that we're both here now, able to hold each other, is nothing less than a miracle."
哦...亲爱的..."妈妈紧紧回抱了我。"这十年来，我默默地看着你成长，却无法向你透露我一直在你身边。如今我们能相拥在此，真是莫大的奇迹。

Her eyes beginning to prickle with tears, Asuka shakily asked, "We... will be able to see each other again, right?"
她的眼眶开始刺痛，泪水涌上，明日香颤抖着问道：“我们……还会再见面的，对吧？”

Mama nodded, her chin gently tapping Asuka's head. "Of that you can be certain. We'll have to wait for the next sync test before we can speak again, though. In the meantime I'm going to see what I can do in here to facilitate a more... subtle communication method."
妈妈点头时，下巴轻触飞鸟的头顶，说道：“这一点你大可放心。我们得等到下一次同步测试才能再聊，但我会尝试在这边找找看，能否建立一种更为隐秘的沟通方式。”

Around them, the world began to flicker like a light about to go out. Mama looked skyward and cursed under her breath. "It's time for you to go, before NERV notices and pulls the plug." She placed a kiss on Asuka's forehead. "Next time, we can have a far more leisurely chat. I'm sure you have a lot of questions for me."
四周的世界开始如即将熄灭的灯光般闪烁。母亲仰望天空，低声咒骂。“你得赶紧离开，免得 NERV 察觉并切断联系。”她在明日香的额头上轻吻一下。“下次，我们可以更从容地聊天。我知道你有很多问题想问我。”

That was an understatement. Asuka gave her mother a squeeze before reluctantly letting go. "Yeah, I do. But... for now... see you later, Mama."
那话真是轻描淡写。明日香紧紧拥抱了母亲一下，然后才不情愿地松开手。“嗯，我会的。不过...现在...回头见，妈妈。”

Mama smiled, but her expression changed as she apparently remembered something. "Oh yes. Tell that lovely young Ikari boy to give Yui my regards. Farewell, Asuka."
妈妈起初微笑，但表情突然一变，像是记起了某事。“对了，让那位可爱的碇家少年转达我对绫波的问候。再见了，明日香。”

Asuka froze. "Wait, you know ab-"
明日香一愣，“等等，你知道——”

"Activation successful! Unit-02 is online!"
激活成功！02 号单元已启动并在线！

In the blink of an eye, she was back in the entry plug.
一瞬间，她便回到了插入栓内。

"And the S2 Engine?" 那 S2 引擎怎么样了？

"Still completely offline. Not a peep out of it throughout the entire test."
依旧完全处于离线状态，整个测试期间毫无动静。

"Good." 很好。

Asuka tuned out the bridge crew; she had more important things to think about, and quickly. First was the fact that Mama was definitely alive and inside Unit-02. There were so many things strange about that entire situation that she didn't know where to start, so instead she focused on what was said, trying to cement the words into her mind before they slipped away.
明日香对舰桥上的嘈杂声置若罔闻；她心中有更紧迫的事要思索，刻不容缓。首要的是，母亲显然还活着，就藏身于二号机之中。这一连串的怪异情况让她无从理清头绪，于是她选择集中精力，努力将听到的信息牢牢记住，以防它们从记忆中溜走。

Mama had been watching over her from inside Unit-02 ever since her... apparent death ten years ago. Mama... was Unit-02, in a manner of speaking? But how did she even get in there? That was going to be one of the first questions Asuka would have to ask next time.
自从十年前看似离世后，妈妈就一直从二号机内部守护着她。可以说，妈妈就是二号机本身。但她究竟是如何进入其中的？这将是下次见面时，阿苏卡首先要问的问题。

"Asuka?" 阿苏卡吗？

And... well... thinking back on it of course Mama would know about Shinji. After all, if Mama had been watching over her then she would have seen them piloting together. At least Mama seemed to like him; things would certainly have been awkward if Mama didn't approve of him, especially considering-
而且...嗯...回想起来，妈妈自然知道真嗣的事。毕竟，如果妈妈一直在关照她，肯定也目睹了他们共同驾驶的场面。还好妈妈似乎对他有好感；要是妈妈不赞成，情况无疑会变得尴尬，尤其是考虑到...

"Asuka! Wake up!" 阿苏卡！快醒醒！

The loud, irritated voice broke Asuka out of her reverie. Her head jerked up, taking in the comm window and the frowning blonde woman in front of her.
刺耳且带着怒气的声音将明日香从沉思中惊醒。她猛然抬头，目光聚焦在通讯窗口上，一位金发女子正皱着眉头站在她面前。

"Is everything alright in there?" Doctor Akagi asked. "We detected the same variances in your brainwaves just before activation as we did with Shinji."
里面一切都正常吗？" 秋吉医生询问道。"我们在激活前检测到你的脑电波出现了与真嗣之前相同的波动。

"Oh. Um." Asuka shook her head. "No, I'm fine, I was just thinking about something, that's all."
哦，嗯。" 明日香摇摇头，"没事，我只是想起了一些事，仅此而已。

Doctor Akagi stared at her for a few long seconds before turning away. "Very well. All three Evas are operational. Return Zero and One to their cages and shut everything down. We'll be doing diagnostics for the rest of the day, and tomorrow we'll run some harmonics tests and simulations. Can't have the pilots getting rusty."
医生阿卡吉凝视她良久，方才转身说道："行吧。三台 Eva 均已就绪。将零号机与一号机归位，关闭所有设备。今日余下时间进行系统诊断，明日则开展谐波测试及模拟训练。绝不能让驾驶员们的技能生疏。"

Asuka's face twisted into a grin. To the bridge crew, it would likely seem that she was excited about getting to do something in her Evangelion again. Which, admittedly, was partially true. But now she only had to wait a day to be able to see Mama again.
明日香脸上绽放出笑容。在舰桥上的船员看来，她似乎因能再次驾驶自己的 EVA 而兴奋不已。确实，这也有一定道理。不过，现在她只需再等一天，就能与母亲重逢了。

The grin almost slipped off her face as she suddenly wondered about what had happened with Shinji.
她脸上的笑容差点消失，突然间她很想知道真嗣那边发生了什么。

XXX

Either Misato didn't notice the twin balls of anxious energy in the back seat of her car, or she simply didn't find their fidgeting worth mentioning. Rei was maintaining a neutral expression, staring out the passenger side window as Tokyo-3 flew past, but Shinji had seen the slight widening of her eyes when he had passed through Unit-00's cage on the way to the change rooms. And when he had stepped out to see Asuka waiting for him, the expression on her face had no doubt been a mirror of his own. But they couldn't bring themselves to speak openly about what they had just experienced while within NERV's walls; all they could do was wait until they got home.
或许葛城美里并未察觉到后座上那两股焦虑的气息，又或许她认为他们的不安举动不值一提。绫波丽面无表情，凝视着窗外疾驰而过的第三新东京市，然而当真嗣经过零号机的笼子前往更衣室时，他捕捉到了她眼中微不可察的惊讶。当他出来见到明日香在等他时，她脸上的表情无疑映照出了他自己的心情。但在 NERV 内部，他们无法坦诚交流所经历的一切；唯有等待回家。

Which, thanks of course to Misato's driving, didn't take very long.
当然，由于美里的驾驶，并没有花费太多时间。

Shinji and Asuka bid a temporary farewell to Misato and Rei as they reached their respective front doors, Asuka also stating that she would get started on dinner in about an hour. The moment the doors closed, she practically threw off her shoes and stomped into the kitchen to turn on the coffee machine. She raised a questioning eyebrow at Shinji, who waved off the offer of a cup and sat down at the table to watch and wait.
碇真嗣和明日香在各自的家门口与美里和绫波短暂告别，明日香还提到她将在一小时后开始做晚饭。门一关，她便急忙脱掉鞋子，快步走进厨房启动咖啡机。她向碇真嗣投去询问的眼神，后者摆手表示不需要咖啡，随后坐在桌旁静静等待。

When they were both seated, Asuka's hands wrapped around a fresh cup of coffee, the two pilots remained silent for a short time, staring unblinkingly at each other. It hardly needed to be said that they had both met their mothers; that fact had been utterly clear just from their reactions during the activation test. But they were both curious. They wanted to hear the other person's story.
两人坐定后，明日香双手环抱着一杯热腾腾的咖啡，两位驾驶员一时无言，彼此凝视，目光坚定。他们早已知晓对方见过自己的母亲，这一点在激活测试中的反应已不言自明。然而，好奇心驱使他们，都渴望聆听对方的故事。

Asuka went first. Her story was over rather quickly, as there wasn't exactly much to talk about yet, but Shinji smiled at just how overjoyed she was at being able to talk to her mother again. The smile quickly faded when Asuka mentioned her mother's parting words.
明日香率先分享。她的叙述很简短，毕竟内容不多，但看到她因能与母亲重逢而满心欢喜，真嗣不禁微笑。然而，一提及母亲的临别之言，她的笑容便迅速黯淡。

"She... knows about me?" he mumbled, then ruefully shook his head. "Oh, well of course. Do... um... do you have any idea how much she actually knows?"
她...知道我的事吗？"他低声自语，接着苦笑着摇了摇头。"哦，那是自然。你...嗯...你知道她究竟了解多少吗？

"At the very least, Mama likely knows everything that's happened while we've been piloting," replied Asuka.
"至少，妈妈很可能对我们驾驶期间发生的一切了如指掌，"阿苏卡回答说。

"Well, that would make se-" Shinji froze, as the memory of a certain incident in Unit-02 played before his mind's eye, causing his cheeks to immediately heat up. And judging by Asuka's red face, she had just come to the same conclusion.
"嗯，那样的话就会 se-" 真嗣突然僵住，脑海中闪过零号机某次事件的画面，脸颊立刻发热。从明日香同样泛红的脸来看，她显然也意识到了同样的事情。

"W-well... um..." she stammered. "L-let's just... put that aside for now, yeah? There's still your side of the story."
呃...这个嘛..." 她有些语塞，"要不我们先搁置这个话题，怎么样？你还没讲你的情况呢。

After taking a moment to let his cheeks go from 'surface of the sun' to merely 'fry an egg', Shinji composed himself, gathered his memories of the test, and began to speak.
待脸颊热度从“炙热如太阳”降至“适宜煎蛋”后，真嗣平复了情绪，回想起测试的细节，随即开口发言。

XXX

"Initiating first stage connections."
开始建立第一阶段的连接。

"Transmitting pulse." 正在发送脉冲。

"Graph readout normal." 图表显示正常。

Shinji frowned. He didn't have much time to experiment; Unit-01 would be shut down the moment the test was completed. He forced himself to relax and closed his eyes, wishing he could switch off his ears as well.
真嗣眉头紧锁。留给他的实验时间不多了，一旦测试结束，零号机就会立刻被停用。他努力让自己放松下来，闭上双眼，心中暗想如果能连耳朵也关闭就好了。

"Full nerve link established."
神经链接已完全建立。

"Harmonics are normal." 谐波属于正常现象。

What if he just... called out to her? That was one way to grab somebody's attention. Of course he couldn't start shouting about his mother or NERV would get somewhat suspicious.
如果他只是……向她呼唤呢？这无疑是吸引某人注意的一种方法。不过，他当然不能大声提及他的母亲，那样 NERV 肯定会起疑心。

"Approaching absolute borderline..."
逼近绝对极限……

But... the Evangelions worked by connecting to a pilot through... the neural link. All one had to do was think and the machine moved. So what if...?
然而... 福音战士依靠与驾驶员的神经连接来操作。只要心中所想，机体便随之动作。那么，假设...？

'...Mum? Are you there? Mum?'
'...妈妈？你在吗？妈妈？'

"Uh, we're getting some slight variances in the pilot's brainwaves."
嗯，飞行员的脑电波出现了一些细微的变化。

The LCL suddenly seemed much warmer than before.
LCL 突然变得比以往更加温暖。

'Mum? Please answer!' '妈妈？请回答我！'

"Shinji, plleeeaaaassssseeeeee fffffffoooooooocccccccccuuuuuuuuuusssssssssss-"
真嗣，求你集中精神——

His eyes shot open. The entry plug had disappeared, to be replaced by... a house? It was definitely a lounge room, somewhat bigger than the one in his own apartment, and he was sitting on a couch in front of a television. Warm sunlight was streaming in through an open window, and the notes of some unknown song were filling the room.
他突然睁开双眼，发现插入栓不见了，眼前竟是一栋房子。这显然是一间客厅，比他自家公寓的客厅还要宽敞，他正坐在沙发上，面对着电视。温暖的阳光从敞开的窗户倾泻而入，一首未知的歌曲旋律在房间里回荡。

"...Shinji?" ...真嗣吗？

In the blink of an eye he was up off the couch, turning to face the speaker; it could only be one person.
一瞬间，他从沙发上跃起，转身面向说话的人；那必定是某个人。

"...Mum..." ...妈妈...

Another eyeblink, and he was practically lifted off the ground and crushed into his mother's chest. He wrapped his arms around her and held on like he was drowning.
转眼间，他几乎被猛地抱起，紧贴在母亲的胸前。他双臂紧紧环抱住她，仿佛溺水者抓住救命稻草一般。

"Oh... I'm so happy to finally be able to talk to you again, my dear," said Mum. "You don't know how agonising it's been to only be able to watch you on the few rare occasions you've been piloting Unit-01."
哦... 能再次与你交谈，我真是太高兴了，亲爱的，"妈妈说道，"你无法想象，只能在寥寥几次你驾驶初号机时远远观望，那种煎熬有多深。

"S-sorry," Shinji stammered. "It's just-"
抱歉，" 真嗣结巴地说。"只是-

"I know, dear," Mum interrupted. "I know all about how you can't project an AT-Field, and how you mostly co-pilot Unit-02 with Kyoko's daughter. I'd rather you two work together, and not be able to see you as much, rather than have you risk your life piloting Unit-01 without protection. And-" She broke off, looking at the ceiling with a displeased look. "Damnit, I was hoping for more time. If we stay like this much longer, that Akagi woman will know something is going on."
我明白，亲爱的，"妈妈插话道，"我清楚你无法张开 AT 力场，以及你多数时候是与京子的女儿共同驾驶二号机。我更希望你们携手合作，哪怕因此少见你几面，也不愿你无防护地冒险驾驶初号机。还有——"她话音戛然而止，面露不悦地望向天花板，"真该死，我本想争取更多时间。若我们继续这样，赤木那女人迟早会察觉到异样。

"Next time?" Shinji echoed. "Wait, wouldn't they have already noticed something by now?"
下次再说？" 真嗣反问道。"等等，他们现在难道还没发现什么异常吗？

His mother turned a sly grin on him. "You'll see when you get back." She drew him in closer and planted a soft kiss on his forehead. "I love you, Shinji. I'll see you again soon. Hopefully."
他的母亲狡黠地一笑，对他说：“等你回来就明白了。”她将他拉近，温柔地吻了吻他的额头。“我爱你，真嗣。希望不久后能再见到你。”

Struggling to maintain his composure, Shinji blurted out, "I'll make sure I'm in Unit-01 first for the next test!"
真嗣竭力维持镇定，却忍不住喊道：“下次试验，我一定要第一个进入初号机！”

Mum nodded and- 妈妈点头，然后-

-and he was back in the entry plug. The sheer suddenness of the transition left Shinji feeling rather unnerved. He took several breaths, despite the LCL doing that job for him, to try and calm himself down. A glance at the comm window showed Asuka staring expectantly at him, and he gave her the slightest of nods.
-他又回到了插入栓内。这突如其来的变化让真嗣感到十分不安。尽管 LCL 已为他提供了呼吸，他还是不由自主地深呼吸几次，试图平复心情。看向通讯窗口，明日香正满怀期待地注视着他，他便向她轻轻点了点头。

"And then you sneakily told me how to contact my own mother," Asuka finished.
"接着你悄悄地告诉了我联系我母亲的方法，" 明日香说完。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah. I'd been in my Eva for a while at that point, thinking about how to reach out to Mum, but it was only when I... started thinking at her that I got a response. Luckily you managed to work out what I was trying to say."
真嗣点头道：“是的，那时我已经在 Eva 里待了一阵子，琢磨着如何联系妈妈，直到我向她倾诉心声，才收到回应。还好你弄明白了我的意图。”

Asuka grinned at him, tapping a finger on the side of her head the same way he had done. "I sure did, you clever boy."
明日香冲他咧嘴一笑，学着他之前的动作，用手指敲了敲太阳穴。"我当然记得，你这机灵鬼。"

Blushing slightly at the praise, Shinji pushed on. "So both our mothers are in our Evas, and they've been watching over us. Which means my mum would also know about you, since when you first came to Japan you were using Unit-01 until your Eva arrived."
真嗣因受到表扬而微微脸红，继续说道：“看来，我们俩的母亲都存在于各自的 Eva 中，一直守护着我们。这意味着我妈妈也会了解你的情况，毕竟你初到日本时，是使用零号机，直到你的 Eva 送达。”

"Yes, but she would likely know less about me than Mama knows about you," Asuka rebutted.
"没错，但她对我的了解恐怕不及妈妈对你的了解深，"明日香反驳说。

Shinji's face fell. "I know, and now I feel really bad for-"
真嗣的脸色一沉。"我明白，现在我心里特别不是滋味，因为-"

"Stop right there!" Asuka stood up and leaned on the table, looming over him. "Do I even need to get into why you shouldn't feel bad?" Shinji's only response was to blink at her. "Your own mum said she'd rather have you be safe by piloting with me. So none of this self-deprecating shit!"
站住！" 明日香起身，双手撑桌，俯视着他。"我还需要解释你为何不该自责吗？" 真嗣只是眨了眨眼。"你妈妈都说了，她更希望你安全地与我一同驾驶。别再自我贬低了！

Leaning away as much as he could while still sitting down, Shinji stared at his suddenly angry housemate. "U-um... okay," he apprehensively replied. "But... now that I know she's in there, I want to at least try to do our next simulation training in Unit-01, so we can catch up if nothing else."
尽管坐着，碇真嗣还是尽力向后仰，他看着突然发怒的室友，忐忑地回应：“嗯...好吧。不过，既然我知道她在里面，我想至少用初号机进行下一次模拟训练，这样我们至少能追上进度。”

Her ruffled feathers settling back down, Asuka dropped back into her seat and took a sip of her coffee. "That's fine," she said, setting the cup on the table slightly harder than normal. "It won't hurt to get a little solo training every now and then. Anyway!" Shinji jumped slightly at her sudden exclamation. "You met your mother. That means you've finally seen what she looks like, yeah?"
她的羽毛渐渐平复，明日香坐回座位，轻啜一口咖啡。“没事，”她语气略显生硬地将杯子搁在桌上。“偶尔独自训练一下也无伤大雅。对了！”她突然提高声音，让真嗣不禁一惊。“你见到了你母亲。现在你总算知道她长什么样了吧？”

"Of course," Shinji instantly replied. "She looks...uh... her hair is..." He trailed off, trying to remember what he'd seen, then snarled and smacked the side of his head. "Oh come on! I was looking right at her! How can I still not know?!"
当然，" 真嗣立刻回应，"她看起来...呃...她的头发..." 他话没说完，努力回想刚才的情景，随后恼怒地拍了拍自己的脑袋。"真是的！我明明就在盯着她看！怎么还是想不起来呢？！

The tables now turned, it was Asuka's turn to lean away from Shinji's anger as he grabbed at his head with one hand and slapped the table hard with the other. Recovering quickly, she snatched hold of his wrist just as he raised it again. "Calm down!" she ordered.
局势突变，明日香不得不避开真嗣的怒气，他一手捂头，另一手猛击桌面。她迅速反应，就在他再次举手时，紧紧抓住了他的手腕。"冷静下来！"她厉声说道。

Shinji glared at her, about to run off at the mouth, but suddenly they both heard the front door open and a voice call out, "Hey kids, everything alright? I heard shouting."
真嗣怒视着她，正要大发牢骚，忽然两人都听到前门开启，一个声音传来：“嘿，孩子们，没事吧？我听到有喊声。”

Two sets of eyes darted towards each other. Asuka quickly let go of his wrist and sat back down, picking up her coffee cup while Shinji rubbed a hand down his face.
两双眼睛迅速相望。明日香随即松开他的手腕，坐回座位，拿起咖啡杯，真嗣则用手揉了揉脸。

"Yeah, we're fine Misato," Asuka replied as their guardian stepped into their kitchen. Before Misato could question further, she asked, "What's up? You getting impatient for dinner?"
嗯，我们挺好的，美里。"明日香回应着，当他们的监护人踏入厨房。美里还没来得及追问，她便问道："怎么了？是不是等不及吃晚饭了？

Misato sighed heavily. "No. Well, I mean, yeah I am hungry, but I just got a sudden call to return to NERV. Something's going on and my presence has been... requested."
真嗣叹了口气。“不，其实我确实饿了，但突然接到电话，要我回 NERV。似乎出了什么事，需要我回去。”

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other again, their anger faded to be replaced by confusion. "That sounds... ominous," Asuka remarked. "And I take it this doesn't concern us?"
真嗣和明日香再次目光交汇，怒火已转为迷茫。“这话听着……挺不祥的，”明日香说道。“看来这事与我们无关？”

"No, just the higher ups. Afraid I can't say more than that." Misato turned around to head back out. "Don't bother making anything for me. I can't even say for sure when I'll be getting back home."
不，仅限于高层。恐怕我无法透露更多。" 碇真嗣转身向外走去。"不用特意为我准备什么。我还不确定何时能回来。

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji saw a suspicious look on Asuka's face. "...Alright," he tentatively said. "Well... um... have a good night?"
真嗣用眼角余光察觉到明日香脸上闪过一丝可疑的神色。“……好吧，”他略带迟疑地说，“嗯……那么……祝你有个好梦？”

Misato's only response was an amused snort and a muttered, "Yeah, right," before the front door closed.
美里只是轻笑一声，低声说了句“得了吧”，接着前门便关上了。

Tense silence filled the kitchen for a few moments, eventually broken by Asuka's grim tone. "Whatever's happening at NERV, it's pretty freaking big."
厨房里一度弥漫着紧张的沉默，片刻后，明日香严肃的声音打破了寂静。"NERV 那边发生的事情，绝对非同小可。"

Shinji turned his head to look at her. "What could it be though, if not an Angel?"
真嗣转头望向她，问道：“如果不是使徒，那还能是什么？”

"Even an organisation dedicated to protecting humanity from giant aliens can suffer from internal issues, Shinji," Asuka replied. "People need paying, supplies need procuring... and problems can happen with its employees." She tapped a finger against her chin. "My guess is that our guardian has been called in for questioning."
即便是致力于保护人类免受巨型外星人威胁的组织，也难免会有内部问题，真嗣。" 明日香回应说，"员工得发工资，物资得采购...员工之间也可能出现矛盾。" 她用手指轻点下巴，"我估计我们的守护者是被叫去接受询问了。

"What?!" Shinji exclaimed. "They think Misato did something bad?"
什么？！" 真嗣惊讶地说，"他们觉得美里做了不好的事？

"Not necessarily. Could be that they hope she can shed some light on whatever happened. Like maybe she saw a certain person around the time of whatever happened, you know?"
未必如此。他们或许指望她能透露些许事发时的内情。比如她可能目击了某个关键人物，你懂的。

Shinji took a deep breath, exhaling it softly and releasing some tension along with it. "Oh, I see."
真嗣深吸一口气，缓缓呼出，随之释放了些许紧张。"哦，原来如此。"

"Now then. As I was about to say before Misato came in, don't stress yourself out about your mother." Asuka tapped the side of her head. "Remember what happened last time?"
那么，就像我刚才在美里进来之前想说的，别太为你的母亲操心了。" 明日香敲了敲自己的太阳穴，"还记得上次的情况吗？

Guiltily ducking his head, Shinji sighed. "Yeah, a massive headache and nothing to show for it," he glumly recalled.
真嗣羞愧地低下头，叹了口气。“唉，头痛欲裂，却什么也没得到，”他沮丧地回忆着。

"Exactly. Whatever trauma is blocking off those memories had to have been pretty damn serious. It's not going to go away just like that." She punctuated her words with a snap of her fingers. "Now that you can talk to your mum, you can work at this slowly and steadily. After all... I..."
的确，能阻碍这些记忆的创伤肯定相当严重，不会轻易消失。" 她用手指的响声强调了这一点。"既然你现在能和母亲沟通，可以慢慢来，稳扎稳打。毕竟...我...

Shinji noticed her trail off, looking away with a strange, somewhat sad look on her face. "...Asuka?"
真嗣察觉到她的话音渐渐低沉，目光转向别处，脸上浮现出一种异样且略带忧伤的神情。"...是明日香吗？"

"I did... see her after she died," Asuka quietly finished. "This is all so... most of me is just so goddamn happy that she's still alive, but there's still a little part that's like 'you saw her ha-... her body!'"
我确实...在她去世后见过她，" 明日香轻声说道。"这一切都太...我大部分只是无比高兴她还活着，但内心仍有一小部分在想'你确实见过她的遗体！'

Though she very quickly corrected herself, Shinji still caught that slip of the tongue. While it did confirm that something happened with Asuka's mother's death, he wasn't about to poke that wasp nest until he was sure they were both ready.
虽然她迅速纠正了自己的失言，但真嗣还是注意到了。这确实暗示了与明日香母亲去世有关的事情，但他并不急于探究，除非他确信两人都已做好准备。

"Well...I guess all we can do is just... keep talking to them," he finally said. "We do kinda need to... reconnect with them in a sense. And if you and I are in different Evas we'll also have a bit of privacy for any... sensitive topics."
嗯...我想我们只能继续和他们保持沟通了，"他最终说道。"我们确实需要在某种程度上与他们重建联系。而且如果你和我驾驶不同的 Eva，我们也能有一些私密空间来讨论敏感话题。

Asuka stared at Shinji for a moment before giving him a weak smile. "Clever boy," she remarked. "I hadn't even really thought of that yet." She shook her head and stood up, finishing the last of her coffee and rinsing the cup out in the sink. "Well anyway, enough of all... this. Let's get started on dinner before Rei comes over to complain."
明日香凝视了真嗣片刻，随后向他投去一个勉强的微笑。“你真机灵，”她赞叹道，“我还没来得及想到那一步呢。”她摇摇头，站起身，喝完咖啡后将杯子在水槽中冲洗干净。“算了，不说这些了。我们赶紧准备晚餐吧，免得零来了又抱怨。”

Shinji quirked an eyebrow. "I'm pretty sure Rei wouldn't complain about that."
真嗣挑眉道：“我敢肯定，绫波对此不会有任何不满。”

"Complain about what?" 有什么可抱怨的？

"Gah!" 啊！

Twin shouts of surprise erupted from Shinji and Asuka's mouths, and Shinji almost jumped out of his chair. "R-Rei?" he stammered. "Um... hi. When did you come in?"
真嗣和明日香同时惊呼出声，真嗣差点从椅子上蹦起来。“绫波？”他结结巴巴地问道，“呃...你好。你什么时候进来的？”

"Just now," Rei replied. "It seems you somehow did not hear me enter." She glanced at the kitchen bench and her tone of voice might have turned slightly reproachful. "It also seems that you have yet to start dinner. Would you care for some assistance?"
我刚进来，" 蕾说，"你好像没注意到。" 她看了看厨房台面，语气略显责怪。"你还没开始做晚饭吧？需要我帮忙吗？

"...Yeah, sure," Asuka lamely replied. "Anything you're in the mood for tonight?"
...嗯，当然，" 明日香有些敷衍地回答。"今晚有什么特别想吃的吗？

"Whatever you-" 无论你做什么-

"-choose to make is fine, I get it," Asuka interrupted with a bemused sigh. As she turned around to head to the fridge, she shot Shinji the barest hint of a smirk.
"随便你选什么，我懂了，" 明日香带着一丝无奈打断，转身走向冰箱时，对真嗣露出了几乎难以察觉的微笑。

Synchronisation was absolutely not needed to detect the aura of 'I told you so' emanating from the smug redhead.
完全无需同步，便能感受到那位自得其乐的红发人身上“我早就说过”的气息。

"Thank you for complying, Major Katsuragi," the security officer said as he unlocked the door and opened it, beckoning for her to step through. "We hope to resolve this matter as swiftly as possible."
感谢您的配合，葛城少校，"保安官说着，解锁开门，并示意她进入。"我们希望能尽快处理好这件事。

Misato huffed and strode past the man into the cell. "Can you at least give me an idea how long this will take? I am the guardian of our pilots after all."
碇真嗣哼了一声，径直越过那人走进牢房。“你至少能透露一下这需要多久吗？毕竟，我是我们驾驶员的监护人。”

"I'm afraid I do not have that information, ma'am. I can say that Section Two surveillance of the pilots has been stepped up for the duration of this... situation."
很抱歉，女士，我无法提供那方面的信息。但我可以告诉您，鉴于当前情况，对飞行员的第二部分监控已经加强。

Clearly deciding there was no more to be said, the officer closed the door. Misato heard the rattle of the key in the lock followed by two sets of footsteps fading into the distance. She let out a long-held sigh and sank heavily onto the cell's bed.
显然觉得无需再多言，警官便关上了门。碇真嗣听到钥匙在锁孔中转动的声响，紧接着是两串脚步声逐渐消失在远处。她长出一口气，沉重地坐到了牢房的床上。

'Kaji, just what the hell have you gotten yourself into now?' she angrily thought.
'加治，你这次究竟又卷入了什么麻烦？' 她怒气冲冲地想。

She wasn't stupid; her I-can't-tell-if-he's-my-boyfriend had been coming and going ever since he arrived in Japan with Asuka and Unit-02, and it wasn't to see some other woman on the side. He was determined to find 'the truth', no matter what happened to him as a result. One hand dropped to her side and fidgeted with the lump the flash drive Kaji had given her made in her jacket's outer lining. She had yet to see what was actually on the device, as her plan had been to look over its contents and discuss them with him.
她并不愚笨；那个难以界定是否为男友的人，自从与明日香及二号机一同来到日本后，便频繁地出现又消失，并非为了与其他女子幽会。他铁了心要揭开“真相”，无论自己将面临何种后果。一只手垂下，不安地摸索着夹克外层衬里中加持给她的 U 盘。她尚未查看 U 盘内容，原打算先浏览一番，再与他商讨。

Her gut churned at the possibility that that was soon going to be rather difficult to do.
想到这件事不久将变得颇为棘手，她的胃不禁翻腾起来。

"Hey Shinji!" Asuka called out from the comfort of the couch in front of the television. "Why are Japanese commercials so freaking weird?"
嘿，真嗣！" 明日香坐在电视前的沙发上喊道，"日本的广告怎么这么怪异啊？

"Weird?" Shinji poked his head in from the kitchen, where he had been washing up after dinner as he had lost at Janken. He glanced at the television, which was now showing a commercial depicting a man eating a long, long piece of gum. "Uh, they seem pretty normal to me. Then again I have grown up here."
很奇怪吗？" 真嗣从厨房探出头来，他刚洗完碗，因为猜拳输了负责饭后清理。他瞥了一眼电视，现在正播放着一个男人吃着一根超长的口香糖的广告。"呃，我觉得他们挺正常的。毕竟我是在这里长大的。

Asuka gave a half-shrug as the man stared seductively at the screen while still feeding the gum into his mouth. "Yeah, I suppose so. If you were watching German television there would likely be something you'd consider crazy. I don't think we have anything that compares to the game shows here though."
明日香半耸肩，那男子魅惑地盯着屏幕，同时嘴里不停地嚼着口香糖。“嗯，应该是吧。如果你看德国电视，大概会看到一些你觉得很疯狂的内容。但我觉得，我们这里没有能和这里的游戏节目相提并论的。”

"...Okay I have to give you that one," Shinji bemusedly replied with a slight shake of his head. "Even I think some of them are a bit weird. Like that one where the contestants have to bend in weird ways to fit through walls sliding towards them."
...好吧，这一点我得承认，" 真嗣带着一丝困惑回答，微微摇头。"就连我也觉得其中有些挺奇怪的。比如那个环节，参赛者得扭曲身体，才能穿过向他们滑来的墙壁。

"Don't think I've seen that one."
我好像还没见过那个。

The ringing of the phone in the kitchen interrupted their conversation. Shinji went back to the kitchen to answer it while Asuka returned her attention to the television, turning the volume down a bit so she could try and hear him.
厨房电话的铃声打断了他们的对话。真嗣返回厨房接听，而明日香则将注意力转回电视，稍稍调低音量，试图听清他的声音。

"Hello? ... Ah... Hallo. Ist deutsch besser?"
喂？...啊...你好。用德语说是不是更合适？

She raised one eyebrow as he suddenly started speaking German, trying to figure out who would be calling this late in the day that would be speaking her native tongue. Then he continued speaking and her other eyebrow shot up.
她挑起一边的眉毛，因为他突然说起德语，心中纳闷这么晚了谁会打电话来，还用她的母语交谈。接着他继续说，她的另一边眉毛也跟着扬起。

"Asuka? Ja, sie ist hier. Wen soll ich melden? ...Oh... Okay."
Asuka 吗？对，她在这儿。要我通知谁吗？……哦……明白了。

The television completely forgotten, Asuka was already turned to face the doorway when Shinji passed through it, giving her the phone and a puzzled look. "It's apparently your... stepmother?" he said, the question evident in his tone of voice, but Asuka didn't have time to talk about it.
电视早已被抛诸脑后，当真嗣穿过门时，明日香已转过身来，面向门口。他递给她电话，脸上写满疑惑。“这好像是你的……继母？”他问道，语气中透露出不确定，但明日香此刻无暇细谈。

She took the phone and stared at it for a few seconds, before hesitantly holding it to her ear and warily saying, "...Hallo?"
她拿起电话，凝视了几秒，随后犹豫地将其贴近耳朵，谨慎地开口：“...喂？”

"...Hallo Asuka..." ...你好，飞鸟...

Even over the phone, there was no mistaking that voice. "...Katharina."
电话那头的声音，一听便知。“……卡塔琳娜。”

XXX

Curiosity compelled Shinji to delay his return to the kitchen. He could not recall Asuka ever mentioning having a stepmother, and she had not exactly reacted happily upon hearing about who the call was from. He could only hear Asuka's side of the conversation, and at the moment it seemed to be the standard 'how have you been?' questions and answers of a typical social call. After a minute or so Asuka seemed to unwind, relaxing into the couch, and her voice gradually stopped sounding so... formal. He returned to the kitchen, pausing only for a moment when he heard Asuka say, "Him? Oh, he's my friend and roommate."
好奇心让真嗣放慢了回厨房的脚步。他不记得明日香提过她有继母，而且她听到电话那头是谁时，反应并不高兴。他只能听到明日香这边的对话，内容似乎是常见的社交电话中“你最近怎么样？”这类问题和回答。大约一分钟后，明日香放松下来，靠在沙发上，声音也变得不那么拘谨。他回到厨房，当听到明日香说“他？哦，他是我的朋友兼室友。”时，他稍作停留。

And right as Shinji picked up a cup to dry it, he almost dropped it on his foot when she started sputtering and said, in a not-nearly-quiet-enough voice, "K-Katharina! I... yeah, alright, I find his accent cute too..."
就在真嗣拿起杯子准备擦干之际，她突然结巴着，用略显响亮的声音说：“K-Katharina！我...好吧，我也觉得他的口音挺可爱的。”这话让他差点失手将杯子砸在脚上。

At that point he decided he should hurry up and finish drying the dishes, so he could make a tactical retreat. It wouldn't take long now that his face was radiating so much heat he wouldn't need a towel.
那时，他决定得赶紧把碗碟擦干，以便能巧妙地撤退。既然他的脸热得发烫，不用毛巾也能迅速搞定。

Shinji busied himself in his room tidying up things that were already clean and neat, and even changing his bedsheets three days earlier than normal. With nothing else to do, and Asuka still on the phone, he picked up his SDAT, blew a layer of dust off of it, and laid down on his bed to listen to some music.
真嗣在房间里忙于整理那些本就井井有条的物品，甚至比往常提前三天更换了床单。无所事事之际，明日香仍在通话中，他拿起自己的 SDAT，吹掉上面的尘埃，随后躺下聆听音乐。

Ten minutes later he had to pause the SDAT as his phone began ringing. And as he reached for it, Shinji realised he could hear a second phone in the apartment also ringing. With a sigh, he dropped the SDAT on his bed and quickly headed out to the kitchen, where Asuka was already standing.
十分钟后，他不得不暂停 SDAT，因为手机铃声响起。伸手去拿手机时，真嗣察觉到公寓内另一部手机也在响。他叹了口气，将 SDAT 随手丢在床上，快步走向厨房，只见明日香已站在那里。

"-don't worry, Katharina, I'll be fine," Asuka said into the house phone. "I've done this plenty of times before and I've got Shinji with me... Yeah, I l-... bye." She set the phone down on the kitchen table and brushed past Shinji, who thought he saw a flash of red on her face. Shrugging it off, he put his shoes on and followed her out the door.
"-别担心，卡塔琳娜，我不会有事的，" 明日香对着家用电话说道。"这种事我经历得多了，而且还有真嗣在... 是的，我... 再见。" 她放下电话，从真嗣身边匆匆走过，他瞥见她脸上掠过一丝红晕。他没多想，穿上鞋子，紧随其后出了门。

Once the three pilots were in the Section Two car and on their way to NERV, Shinji awkwardly cleared his throat and said, "So... a stepmother, huh?"
三位飞行员坐上第二分部的车，前往 NERV 途中，真嗣尴尬地清了清嗓子，开口道：“也就是说……有了个继母呢？”

Asuka, slouched in her seat with arms folded, muttered, "Yeah. That bastard father of mine married a nurse." A scowl erupted on her face for a brief moment before she swiftly blanked it again.
明日香双臂抱胸，懒散地坐在椅子上，低声抱怨：“没错，我那混账老爸娶了个护士。”她脸上短暂地露出怒色，但很快又恢复了面无表情。

Shinji tilted his head, somewhat puzzled by her emotions. "You seem angry, but you talked for a while on the phone with her."
真嗣歪着头，对她的情绪感到有些不解。“你看起来很生气，可你刚才和她通电话聊了很久。”

Asuka blinked, stared at him for a moment and then shook her head. "Oh no, she's fine. I... don't really have any problems with her, I suppose. It's him. He..." She waved a hand in dismissal. "Never mind for now. I'll tell you when we get home. Let's focus on what's in front of us."
明日香眨了眨眼，凝视了他片刻，随后摇摇头。“不，她没问题。我...对她倒没什么意见。是他。他...”她摆摆手，示意不谈这个。“先不说了。回家再跟你细讲。现在先处理眼前的事。”

Shinji nodded. Turning to the driver, he asked, "Does NERV know much about this Angel yet?"
真嗣点头后，转向司机询问：“NERV 对这只使徒的情报掌握得怎么样了？”

"Not much," the bald man replied. "It's sitting in orbit right above Tokyo-3, just outside our defensive envelope. Hasn't done anything else yet."
没什么，"光头男子答道，"它就悬停在东京-3 上方的轨道，恰好在我们的防御范围之外，尚未有进一步行动。

Asuka cursed. "Are we going to have a repeat of Sahaquiel or something?"
明日香不满地说：“难道又要上演一次萨拉菲尔事件？”

"We would not be able to defeat it the same way if that is the case," Rei replied. "With Pilot Aida incapacitated, there would only be two Evangelions. Major Katsuragi's idea would not work."
如果真是这样，我们无法用同样的方法战胜它，" 绫波丽回应说。"相田飞行员受伤，我们只剩下两台福音战士。葛城少校的方案无法实施。

"That's not likely to happen anyway," Shinji interjected. "None of the Angels have attacked the same way as a previous one. Whatever this one's plan is, we'll need to think of something new."
那不太可能发生，" 真嗣插话说。"每个使徒的攻击方式都不同。面对这个使徒，我们得想出新的应对策略。

Asuka conceded the point with a nod of her head. "In the end it won't matter what it does. We've kicked the shit out of every other Angel, and we'll keep going until they're all gone. "
明日香点头表示认同。“说到底，它做什么都无所谓。我们已经打败了其他所有使徒，我们会继续战斗，直到他们一个不剩。”

XXX

"Major Katsuragi?" 葛城上尉？

Misato stood up from the bench she'd been sitting on for several hours and walked over to the door to her little cell. "What is it?"
真嗣从坐了数小时的板凳上起身，走向自己小牢房的门。"这是什么？"

"An Angel has been detected in low orbit directly above Tokyo-3," the man on the other side said as a key rattled in the lock. "In light of the situation you have been granted a release to oversee the situation until it is resolved."
在东京-3 正上方的低轨道探测到了一个使徒，"对方的人说道，同时钥匙在锁中转动。"鉴于当前形势，你已被授权暂时释放，负责监督直至问题得到解决。

She sighed heavily. "Of course. It's always a damn Angel. I'd somehow forgotten for one brief moment where we work. I suppose I'll be asked to return here when it's over?"
她深深叹了口气。“果然，又是那个该死的 Angel。我竟一时忘了我们是在哪儿工作。看来事情结束后还得回来一趟吧？”

"Most likely, yes." 很可能，是的。

The door opened, and Misato strode out as if it had been entirely her decision to stay in that cell. "Fine," she muttered. "Let's just get this damn thing over with."
门一开，Misato 便昂首阔步地走了出来，仿佛留在那间牢房完全是她自己的选择。“行吧，”她低声抱怨，“赶紧把这破事解决掉。”

When the pilots reached the command centre, the image on the giant screen that greeted them was, as expected, baffling.
飞行员们到达指挥中心时，大屏幕上呈现的图像不出所料，让人一头雾水。

"I... really have no idea what to make of this one," Asuka admitted after a moment of staring at the Angel. "Some sort of... glowing bird skeleton?"
我...实在搞不懂这是什么，" 明日香凝视着使徒片刻后坦言。"某种...发光鸟骨？

"Appropriately enough, the MAGI have given it the codename Arael," replied Doctor Akagi. "Also known as the Angel of Birds."
很贴切，MAGI 系统给它起的代号是 Arael，"赤木博士说道，"也就是鸟之天使。

"How are we going to defeat it though?" asked Shinji. "There's no way we can get up there, and none of our weapons will reach either." He paused for a second. "Wait, what about the Positron Cannon? Would that have enough power?"
我们该如何击败它呢？" 真嗣问道。"我们无法靠近，而且我们的武器也打不到。" 他顿了顿。"等等，用正电子加农炮行不行？那东西的威力足够吗？

"That was my first thought," said Misato, with a sigh and a shake of her head. "But we don't have the time to set up the infrastructure again, and even with all the power of Japan there's no guarantee the beam will maintain cohesion over such a long distance, let alone punch through an AT-Field."
那确实是我的第一反应，" 碇真嗣叹息着，摇了摇头，"可我们没时间重建基础设施，即便倾尽日本之力，也无法确保光束在如此远的距离上仍能保持凝聚，更遑论穿透 AT 力场。

"So... what?" Asuka waved a hand at the screen. "We can't punch it in the face, we can't shoot it in the face... you want us to go out there, flip it the bird and throw harsh language at it or something?"
那又怎样？" 明日香对着屏幕摆了摆手，"我们既不能给它一拳，也不能开枪打它...难道要我们出去，对它竖个中指，再用狠话对付它？

Shinji stifled a snort of amusement at the mental image of the Evangelions standing in a row outside the city, both arms extended, middle fingers raised, pointing skyward. Misato, the person standing closest to him, caught his eye and gave a tiny grin.
真嗣脑海中浮现出使徒们列队站在城外，双臂高举，竖起中指指向天际的画面，差点笑出声。站在他旁边的负责人，察觉到他的眼神，嘴角勾起一抹浅笑。

Doctor Akagi, on the other hand, rolled her eyes. "While I'm certainly intrigued in testing the effects of an acid tongue against an Angel, that'll have to wait for another time. We'll be sending you three out in the hope that the Angel will detect you and move in closer so that we can engage. Speaking of the Positron Rifle, we actually have a scaled down version for you to use. It requires its own power cable, and it only has eight shots, but it is at least portable."
另一方面，阿卡吉医生翻了个白眼。“我确实对用尖酸刻薄的话语测试天使的反应很感兴趣，不过这得留待下次了。我们将派你们三人出去，希望天使能察觉到你们并接近，以便我们能与之交战。提到正电子步枪，我们其实有一个缩小版供你使用。它需要自带电源线，且仅有八发子弹，但至少便于携带。”

Asuka's eyebrows slowly rose upwards. "Not bad. We'll take it. Finally we have something to replace those anaemic Pallet Rifles."
明日香的眉头渐渐挑起。“挺好的，就用它了。终于有替代品来替换那些无力的托盘步枪了。”

"In defense of those rifles, they were designed and manufactured before the Third Angel arrived," Misato remarked. "And short of stripping a bunch of cannons from several battleships, slapping them together, and finding a way to make that portable, we didn't have a lot of options for armaments."
为这些步枪辩解一下，它们是在第三使徒出现前就设计制造的，" 碇真嗣评论道。"除非从多艘战舰上拆卸大量炮管，将其组装并设法实现便携，否则我们在武器选择上确实有限。

"We don't have time to be sitting around chatting about guns," Doctor Akagi admonished. "Head to your Evas. Shinji, Asuka, you'll be deploying in Unit-01 this ti-"
我们没时间在这里闲扯枪的事，"安西医生告诫说，"赶紧去你们的 Eva。真嗣，明日香，这次你们要驾驶初号机出动了。

"Belay that." 取消那个。

All eyes were drawn to the raised platform in the middle of the room, where Commander Ikari sat at his desk. "The Second and Third Children will deploy in Unit-02," he ordered, his gaze fixed upon the screen and the Angel it displayed.
众人的目光齐聚于房间中央升起的平台上，伊卡里指挥官正坐在桌前。他下令：“第二和第三适格者将驾驶二号机迎战。”视线始终不离屏幕上显示的使徒。

"...Sir?" said Doctor Akagi. "The Committee said-"
...先生？"阿基医生问道。"委员会表示-

"The Committee is not here," Commander Ikari interrupted. "I, however, am. Deploy Unit-02; I will deal with the Committee when this is over."
委员会此刻不在场，"伊卡里指挥官插话道，"但我在此。立即部署二号机，待此事结束后，我自会与委员会交涉。

Doctor Akagi looked like she wanted to press the point for a moment, but then shrugged and turned back to the teenagers. "Well, you heard him. Unit-02 as usual, you two."
阿卡吉医生本想再强调一下，但随即耸了耸肩，转而对那群青少年说：“行了，他说的你们都听到了。照旧，二号机，你们俩上。”

Shinji and Asuka shared a puzzled look. Asuka shook her head and took off for the Evangelion cages, and the other two teenagers were hot on her heels.
真嗣与明日香面面相觑，一脸茫然。明日香摇摇头，疾步向福音战士的机库奔去，另外两名少年也紧跟其后。

XXX

As the elevator took off towards the surface, Shinji felt something gently probing at the edges of his mind. He glanced back at Asuka, giving her a puzzled look. She simply grinned and tapped her chest in response. As understanding dawned, he hesitantly reached out with his mind.
随着电梯向地表升起，真嗣感到有什么东西在轻轻触碰他意识的边缘。他回头望向明日香，露出困惑的表情。她只是咧嘴一笑，并拍了拍自己的胸口。随着理解的逐渐明朗，他犹豫地用心灵探出手去。

"...Hello, Ms Soryu?" he thought. In German, of course.
"...你好，索龙小姐？" 他心里默念，用的自然是德语。

He had to stop himself from visibly reacting at the response. "Good day, young man," an amused-sounding voice responded. "I won't stay long; you two do have a mission to focus on and we don't need NERV getting suspicious. But it is nice to see you face to face, in a manner of speaking."
他极力控制自己，不露出任何反应。“你好，年轻人，”一个带着笑意的声音回答，“我不会耽搁太久；你们有任务在身，我们也不想让 NERV 起疑。不过，能这样直接见到你，也算是一种难得的体验。”

"And you as well, ma'am. It's... um, a little surprising to... hear you reach out like this."
您也如此，女士。这确实...嗯，有点意外，没想到您会这样主动联系。

The voice didn't respond for a moment, perhaps working out how best to explain. "A... a locked door has been opened.Now that you and Asuka have found the keys, communication will be much easier. I must go now. Good luck, and look after my daughter, Shinji Ikari."
声音沉默片刻，似乎在斟酌如何解释最为恰当。"一扇原本紧闭的门现已开启。既然你和明日香找到了钥匙，我们的沟通将变得顺畅许多。我得离开了。祝你好运，请务必照顾好我的女儿，碇真嗣。"

"...I'll... um, do my best."
...我...嗯，会尽我所能。

The presence faded as the elevator slammed into position. Unit-02 disengaged from the locks and the red behemoth strode through the fortress city to its designated location. Five streets away, Unit-00 was doing the same. The two swiftly reached their destinations, a pair of armoury buildings, and retrieved the weapons within. Unit-00, sniper rifle in hand, moved back a ways down the street and then laid down on its back, propping the rifle's barrel up against a heavily reinforced building and aiming into the sky.
随着电梯猛然停稳，那股存在感逐渐消散。二号机解除锁定，红色巨兽大步穿过堡垒城市，直奔指定地点。相隔五条街，零号机亦是如此。两者迅速抵达目的地——两座军械库，并从中取出武器。手持狙击步枪的零号机后退至街道远处，随即仰面躺下，将步枪枪管倚靠在一座坚固的建筑上，瞄准苍穹。

Unit-02, downscaled Positron Rifle in hand, stepped away from the armoury building to let it close, then proceeded further down the street. The weapon was now a partially shoulder mounted design, moving a lot of the weapon's weight off the arm itself for better stability. Unit-02 hefted it and checked it over as the two pilots familiarised themselves with the new weapon.
单元-02 手持缩小版的正电子步枪，从军械库旁退开，待其关闭后继续沿街行进。该武器采用部分肩扛式设计，有效减轻了手臂负担，增强了稳定性。单元-02 举枪检查，两位飞行员正适应这把新装备。

"Quite a bit heavier than the Pallet Rifles," Asuka remarked as Unit-02 swept the weapon back and forth. Both pilots now had a head-mounted aiming system covering their faces, connecting them to the rifle's optics. "Not sure about the recoil though, I can't remember what firing its big brother was like. Besides loud and deadly."
比托盘步枪确实重了不少，" 明日香说道，二号机挥舞着武器。两位驾驶员脸上都戴着头戴式瞄准系统，与步枪的光学系统相连。"至于后坐力，我记不太清了，只记得它的大哥发射时既响亮又致命。

Shinji looked skyward, at where the MAGI were projecting Arael to be, and the barrel of the Positron Rifle followed suit. With such a great distance between them, the Angel looked like little more than another star in the night sky. "Any reaction from the Angel yet?" he asked of the command centre.
真嗣仰望天空，目光追随着 MAGI 所指示的 Arael 位置，阳电子步枪的枪口也同步调整。相隔甚远，那使徒在夜空中仅如另一颗星辰般渺小。“使徒有动静了吗？”他向指挥中心询问。

"Nothing yet," Lieutenant Hyuga reported. "The target is maintaining its position over Tokyo-3."
目前尚无动静，" 日向副官汇报说。"目标仍在东京-3 上空保持原位。

"Damnit," Asuka muttered. "Come on down here so we can kick your ass already!"
该死，" 明日香嘟囔着。"赶紧下来，看我们怎么收拾你！

The targeting system's crosshair was jittering back and forth, not designed for target acquisition at such an extreme range, but the two halves were gradually coming together in the centre of the screen.
瞄准系统的十字线在屏幕上左右晃动，原本并非设计用于远距离目标锁定，不过两半正慢慢向屏幕中央靠拢。

And then a brilliant light appeared.
紧接着，一道璀璨的光芒显现出来。

"What the-" both pilots uttered at the same time, followed quickly by, "AT-Field, full power!"
什么——"两位飞行员异口同声，随即急促地命令："AT 力场，全功率启动！

As a beam of energy began to light up the night, focused directly on Unit-02, the Evangelion thrust one hand out in front of it as it summoned its barrier.
一道能量束划破夜空，直射二号机，福音战士随即伸出一只手，召唤出防护屏障。

"A particle beam weapon?!"
粒子束武器?!

Shinji's head felt... strange. Like something had managed to sneak into his skull and was now running fingers along his brain.
真嗣感到头部异常，仿佛有什么东西潜入了他的颅内，正用手指轻触他的大脑。

"-psychograph! Mental contamination-"
-心理画像！精神污染-

Whatever was happening in the command centre, Shinji couldn't focus on it. "A...Asuka...?"
指挥中心无论发生何事，真嗣都心神不宁。"A...Asuka...？"

Through gritted teeth, Asuka replied, "Y-yeah, I feel it t-too. It's... att-ttacking our m-minds..."
明日香咬着牙，艰难地说：“对、对，我也有同感。它……正在侵袭我们的意识……”

"C-can't have t-that now, c-can we?"
现在可不能有那个，对吧？

"Hah." Asuka grinned widely. "C-come on then, y-you spiky bas-"
哈哈。" 明日香咧嘴笑得开怀。"来就来，你这刺猬头家伙-

The beam intensified, turning night into pure white and searing Shinji's eyeballs to the back of his skull.
光束猛然增强，将黑夜映成一片纯白，灼烧着真嗣的眼球，仿佛要将它们烧至颅骨深处。

"S-Shinji...!" Asuka's voice had suddenly picked up an echo.
"S-Shinji...!" 明日香的声音突然出现了回音。

"I'm... still... here!" Getting the words out was like trying to push a building over. Shinji's eyes were closed, he was sure of it because he'd felt them close, and yet the light was still somehow reaching them just as clearly.
"我...依然...在这里！" 说出这些话仿佛在竭力推倒一座大厦。碇真嗣确信自己已经闭上了双眼，然而光线依旧清晰地透入，仿佛他的眼皮并未合拢。

The last thing he heard before losing consciousness was two people crying out in pain with one voice.
失去意识前，他最后听到的，是两个人异口同声的痛苦呼喊。

### Chapter 40 A Kindred Spirit

It was... cold. 那真是... 冷极了。

Shinji groaned, his entire body feeling like a giant had just sat on it, and his head felt twice as bad. Some sort of constant noise was filling his ears. A vehicle? He struggled to get his eyes open; it was as if somebody had attached a ton of weight to them, but soon he could make out greyish light and someone sitting in front of him, looking away. The scenery around him was drab, looking like somebody had sucked the colour out of the world.
真嗣呻吟着，全身仿佛被巨人压过，头部更是剧痛难忍。耳边充斥着持续的噪音，可能是车辆的声音。他费力地睁开眼，感觉眼皮沉重如铅，渐渐地，他看到了灰暗的光线和坐在面前、背对着他的人。四周的景象黯淡无光，仿佛世界失去了色彩。

Where was he? Shinji wracked his brain, trying to work out how he got here, but it only succeeded in making his headache worse. He let out an involuntary groan, which caught the attention of the figure in front of him.
他究竟在哪里？真嗣拼命回忆，试图弄明白自己如何到了这里，结果只是让头痛愈发剧烈。他不由自主地呻吟了一声，引起了前方那人的注意。

"You're finally awake," it said.
"你总算醒了，" 它说道。

Shinji shook his head, trying to clear out the cobwebs. The person sitting across from him, a dour looking dark-haired man with his arms folded in front of him, raised an eyebrow.
真嗣摇摇头，试图驱散脑海中的迷雾。坐在他对面的男子，神情阴郁，黑发，双臂交叉于胸前，挑了挑眉。

"NERV must have really been pushing you hard today, if you're falling asleep just on the ride out of the complex."
NERV 今天肯定让你累坏了，才刚离开综合体，你就在路上打瞌睡了。

Shinji, utterly confused, opened his mouth to respond, but somebody else got there first.
真嗣一头雾水，正要开口回应，却被人抢了先。

"I'm not sleeping!" a female voice retorted from right next to Shinji. He blinked... and realised that the man was not staring at him. He slowly turned his head to the right, and his eyes just about flew out of his head. A little girl was on the seat next to him, her arms also folded as she glared daggers at the man.
"我没在睡觉！"一个女声从新二旁边反驳道。他眨了眨眼，意识到那男人并未盯着他。他缓缓转头向右，眼睛几乎要瞪出眼眶。旁边座位上，一个小女孩双臂交叉，正用尖锐的目光瞪着那男人。

A little girl, clad in a red dress, with a pair of piercing blue eyes and a very familiar mane of flame-red hair.
一位身着红裙的小女孩，蓝眼睛炯炯有神，一头火焰般的红发格外熟悉。

"...Asuka?" ...明日香？

The girl gave no indication of hearing him as she said, "I was just resting my eyes! I'm not tired at all!"
女孩似乎没听见他的话，她回答说：“我刚才只是闭眼休息一下，一点也不累！”

"Of course you aren't," the man replied with a sigh. He stared out the car window. "Wish this damned rain would let up; it's been like this the entire week. I've got things to do!"
当然不是，"男人叹息着回答。他望着车窗外的雨景。"真希望这雨能停，已经下了一整周了。我还有一堆事等着处理呢！

The girl, which Shinji knew had to somehow be Asuka, scowled even harder and looked away from the man. She was now looking directly at Shinji's arm yet still seemed to be unaware of his presence. Was this just a rather strange dream he was having? Or was it... some sort of memory?
那个女孩，真嗣确信她就是明日香，眉头紧锁得更厉害了，转过头去不再看那个男人。她现在正盯着真嗣的手臂，却似乎依旧没有察觉到他的存在。这难道只是他正在做的一个奇怪的梦吗？亦或是，这是某种记忆的片段？

"Clever boy." 机灵的小伙子。

The interior of the car suddenly turned as grey as the sky. Asuka and the man had stopped moving completely, and even the rain was frozen mid-flight.
车内突然变得灰蒙蒙的，与天空无异。明日香和那名男子一动不动，连雨滴也仿佛定格在空中。

And now there was another person in the car; the only other woman Shinji knew of with red hair. "Bwynvienne?" he gasped.
此刻，车里多了一位红发女子，是真嗣认识的另一位红发女性。“布温维恩？”他不禁惊呼。

"Been a while since we last, spoke, huh?" The literally flame-haired woman casually waved a hand in greeting, her other arm resting on the back of the seat behind Asuka. "You just keep getting yourself into stranger and stranger situations. The Infernal Administration actually considered disabling one of their non-critical alert systems because of you."
好久没聊了，是吧？"那位红发如火的女人随意地挥手致意，另一只手搭在飞鸟身后的座椅上。"你总是让自己卷入越来越离奇的事件。地狱管理局甚至考虑过因为你，关闭一个非关键的警报系统。

"Uh... what?" Shinji eloquently replied.
"呃...你说什么？" 真嗣回应道。

"All your soul shenanigans," Bwynvienne clarified. "Things got rather confusing for us when Asuka suddenly disappeared. To us it was like she had completely vanished from existence for a couple of weeks, which is something of a red flag when somebody with multiple souls does that."
关于你们灵魂的那些事，" 布温维恩解释说，"飞鸟突然不见了，让我们一头雾水。她就像从世界上彻底消失了几个星期，这对一个拥有多重灵魂的人来说，显然是个不祥之兆。

"Take it up with Zeruel then," Shinji retorted. "They were the one that forced us to synchronise so high that Asuka got absorbed into the Eva. If we hadn't done that, we would have lost."
那就去跟 Zeruel 理论，" 真嗣反驳说。"是他们逼我们把同步率调得过高，导致明日香被 Eva 吞噬。若非如此，我们早已败北。

Bwynvienne gave an expansive shrug. "Not saying it was a bad thing, just... very, very, interesting to examine."
布温维耶恩宽泛地耸了耸肩。“并非说这是坏事，只是……实在，实在，耐人寻味。”

"Well... whatever." Shinji waved a hand in dismissal. "What's going on here?"
哎... 无所谓了。" 真嗣摆手表示不关心。"这儿是怎么回事？

Looking around, Bwynvienne shrugged again. "Hard to say right now, since I've only just begun to look into it. Initial examination seems to indicate that your soul and Asuka's have become entangled." She interlaced her fingers as a visual example. "I heard NERV mentioning mental contamination too, like the Angel thing is trying to read your mind or something."
环视一圈后，Bwynvienne 再次耸肩。“目前还不好下结论，毕竟我才刚开始调查。初步观察显示，你和 Asuka 的灵魂似乎已经相互缠绕。”她交叉双手，以此作为直观说明。“NERV 那边还提到了精神污染，感觉像是那个使徒想要窥探你的内心。”

"My mind?" Shinji pointed at the frozen scene around them. "This is not my mind."
我的意识？" 真嗣指向四周凝固的景象。"这并非我的意识所为。

Bwynvienne sighed. "No, of course not. Look, I'm not one of those NERV people. My remit is soul contracts and anything that may actively seek to cause problems with said contracts. Despite you and Asuka being my clients... I can't actually do much to help you right now. If the Angel were trying to steal your souls, I could jump in and teach it why you don't mess with the Infernal Administration. Right now all I can do is sit back, watch, and learn what's happening."
布温维耶叹了口气。“不，当然不是。听着，我不是 NERV 的人。我的职责是处理灵魂契约以及任何可能主动干扰这些契约的问题。虽然你和明日香是我的客户，但眼下我帮不上什么忙。如果使徒试图夺取你们的灵魂，我倒是可以介入，让它明白为何不该招惹地狱行政机构。现在我只能旁观，了解事态的发展。”

Frustratedly rubbing a hand across his face, a hand that was not covered by the rubber of a plugsuit for some reason,Shinji snarled. "Then what freakin' good are you?!"
不知为何，真嗣的手并未被插件服的橡胶所覆盖，他烦躁地用手抹了一把脸，怒吼道：“那你们到底有什么用？！”

"...You're going through a stressful situation right now," Bwynvienne slowly replied. "I'm sorry I can't do anything about it, but that's no reason to get mad at me."
...你此刻正面临压力重重的局面，" Bwynvienne 慢慢地说。"很遗憾我帮不上忙，但这也不能成为你对我发怒的理由。

Shinji took a deep breath, and let it slowly hiss out through clenched teeth; the sudden anger seemed to dissipate at the same time. "Sorry," he mumbled.
真嗣深吸一口气，缓缓从紧咬的齿间呼出，怒气仿佛也随之消散。“抱歉，”他低声道。

"No harm done." Bwynvienne stood up. Somehow, the dimensions of the car seemed to mean absolutely nothing. The roof was still above her head, and it had not shifted in the slightest, despite the woman being at least twice as tall as the car. Looking at it made Shinji's eyes water. "Look, I need to go now, take a look at this from all angles. Admin's going to be asking so many questions.I may not be able to help, but I'm definitely rooting for you to get through this in one piece."
并未造成损害。" Bwynvienne 起身站立。不知何故，车内的空间感似乎完全失效。车顶依旧稳稳地在她头顶，尽管这位女士的身高至少是车子的两倍。这一幕让 Shinji 不禁泪眼朦胧。"听着，我得走了，得从各个角度审视这一切。管理员肯定会问个不停。我或许帮不上忙，但我真心希望你能平安度过难关。

"Wait!" Shinji suddenly exclaimed. "Can you... I mean... if Asuka and I don't make it... can you please tell Misato what happened?"
等等！" 真嗣突然喊道，"如果我和明日香没能成功，你能告诉美里真相吗？

Bwynvienne stared at him for a long moment, then nodded. "I can do that, yes, but I won't." Before Shinji could angrily respond, she raised a hand and continued. "I won't, because you will make it through this. Good luck, Shinji."
布温维恩凝视了他好一会儿，随后点头道：“我确实能做到，但我不会去做。”在真嗣愤怒回应之前，她抬手接着说：“我不做，是因为你一定能挺过这一关。祝你好运，真嗣。”

She vanished, and colour slowly began to leech back into the car. Asuka continued staring through his midsection while the man huffed at her and folded his arms.
她消失后，车内的色彩逐渐恢复。阿苏卡依旧盯着那人的腹部，而对方则对她喘着粗气，双臂抱在胸前。

So... the Angel was trying to read their minds, or something like that, and he was seeing Asuka as a young girl so clearly this was one of her memories. She looked to be about four years old, making this close to ten years before they'd met in person. At this point he would have likely just been delivered to his teacher after the death of his mother. It would still be at least another year before he would even know the name Agatha.
因此...天使似乎在尝试窥探他们的内心，他清晰地看到了幼年时期的明日香，这无疑是她的记忆。她那时大约四岁，距离他们实际相遇还有将近十年。那时，他可能刚因母亲去世而被送到老师那里。至少还要再过一年，他才会知晓“阿加莎”这个名字。

And for some reason his plugsuit had been traded in for a school uniform. It was impossible to know if that was important or not.
不知何故，他的战斗服被替换成了校服。这一变化是否关键，无从得知。

The awkward silence was so bad Shinji wished he could make his presence known, just so he didn't have to deal with the second-hand embarrassment. Out of pure curiosity, and not a little boredom as the journey dragged on, Shinji slowly reached around the back of the young girl and gave the gentlest of taps to her right shoulder.
尴尬的沉默让真嗣如坐针毡，他恨不得能打破沉默，免得自己被这种间接的尴尬所困扰。出于好奇，也因旅途的无聊，真嗣小心翼翼地从后面伸出手，轻触了下女孩的右肩。

The result was surprising: Asuka suddenly reached up and brushed her shoulder exactly where he had tapped, side-eyeing the man suspiciously. It could just have been exactly what had happened back then as Asuka remembered it, but it was a hell of a coincidence.
结果出乎意料：明日香突然伸手触碰了自己的肩膀，恰好是之前他轻拍的地方，她用怀疑的目光斜视着那个男人。这或许只是明日香记忆中的情景再现，但如此巧合实在令人难以置信。

It didn't seem like a good idea to press his luck though. Who knew what could happen if Asuka suddenly became aware he was inside her head, staring directly at her past. She had walled those memories up like a fortress, only occasionally peeking over the wall and throwing out a few scraps of information before retreating back inside.
尽管如此，冒险似乎并非明智之举。倘若明日香突然察觉到他正窥探她的内心深处，直面她的过往，后果难以预料。她将那些记忆如同堡垒般严密守护，仅偶尔探头窥视，抛出些许碎片信息，随即又缩回自己的世界。

Shinji wasn't even sure who this man was. Her father? Asuka seemed to have a very similar look on her face now as she did when mentioning how the man had married a nurse. But this man didn't seem to be acting very fatherly towards the young girl... then again Shinji wasn't one to be making judgements on somebody's father.
真嗣甚至搞不清楚这个男人是谁。是她的父亲吗？明日香此刻的表情与她提及这个男人与一位护士结婚时的表情如出一辙。然而，这个男人对这位少女的态度并不显得很父爱...不过，真嗣也不是那种会轻易评判他人父爱的人。

The world went past, and eventually the sky was mostly blocked out by buildings as the car entered a city. There didn't seem to be much traffic on the road, despite... whatever hour this was, and the buildings looked like big metal boxes. This was likely due to Asuka not paying any attention on the journey, or an artefact of how long ago the memory took place. But soon the car reached a building that looked far more real than those surrounding it, one that Shinji could recognise almost instantly: a hospital.
世界在窗外匆匆而过，随着汽车驶入城市，天空逐渐被高楼大厦遮蔽。尽管不知此刻是何时，路上车辆稀少，那些建筑宛如巨大的金属箱子。这或许是因为明日香在旅途中未曾留心，或是记忆久远的缘故。不久，汽车停在一栋远比周围建筑更为真实的建筑前，真嗣几乎立刻认出：那是一家医院。

An uneasy feeling began to settle in his gut. Asuka was going from NERV straight to a civilian hospital. Her mother had died a long time ago. The chances were high that this was a memory of Asuka visiting her mother. And that could mean that this uncaring man was her father; he certainly didn't have the professional detachment of a Section Two agent.
一种不安的感觉在他心中悄然升起。明日香正从 NERV 赶往一家民用医院。她的母亲早已离世。这很可能是明日香探望母亲的记忆。而这个冷漠的男人，极有可能是她的父亲；他显然缺乏第二部门特工应有的职业冷漠。

The car pulled into a parking spot, and Asuka was the first out of the car. The man who was possibly her father was next, followed by the blank slate of a driver. Shinji stared at the car door on his side, wondering if he could actually leave.
汽车缓缓停入车位，明日香率先跳出车门。紧跟其后的是一位男子，或许是她的父亲，而司机则面无表情地跟随。真嗣凝视着自己这侧的车门，心中犹豫不决，不知是否该迈出这一步。

'Well, I'm sitting in the car," he mused. 'I can feel the seat underneath me. I was able to touch Asuka's shoulder, so therefore...'
'嗯，我正坐在车里，"他沉思道。我能感觉到座位在我身下。我能够触碰到明日香的肩膀，由此可见...'

To his relief, the door easily opened at his touch, and Shinji got out. He started to look around for where the others had gone, only for a rope around his waist to suddenly yank him backwards. At least, that was what it felt like.
令他宽慰的是，门在他触碰下轻易开启，真嗣随即走出。他环顾四周寻找其他人的踪迹，不料腰间的绳索突然猛力将他向后拉扯。至少，他感觉如此。

Shinji flew backwards through the air, unable to even look around until the invisible rope suddenly slackened. Quickly getting his feet back on solid ground, he turned around to see Asuka with arms folded, glaring again at her probably-father.
真嗣被一股力量抛向后方，直到那无形之绳骤然松开，他才得以四下张望。他迅速稳住身形，双脚踏实地，随即转身，只见明日香双臂抱胸，再次怒目瞪视着她那疑似父亲的人。

"I've said it before," the man frustratedly said. "Stop running in the car park!"
我之前就说过，" 男人不耐烦地说，"别在停车场里乱跑！

Asuka's only response was to roll her entire head before huffing and continuing on. Once she was about five meters away from Shinji, the invisible rope returned. Understanding dawned; whatever was happening in this memory, he had to stay close to its source. He quickened his pace until he was walking right next to the grumpy girl. Other people were passing by, but they all looked like store mannequins with completely featureless faces.
明日香只是把头一扭，哼了一声便继续前行。当她距离真嗣大约五米时，那根无形的绳索再次出现。真嗣恍然大悟：在这段记忆中，他必须紧随其源头。他加快脚步，与那位脾气不佳的女孩并肩而行。周围有人经过，但他们都面无表情，宛如商店里的模特。

They entered the hospital, and Asuka looked ready to take off again until the sound of a throat clearing behind him took the wind out of her sails. She directed one more glare over her shoulder before stopping, looking thoughtful.
他们走进医院，明日香本已准备再次离开，却被身后一声清嗓子打断了。她不甘心地回头瞪了一眼，随后停下脚步，陷入沉思。

"I... uh," she hesitantly began. "I gotta go to the bathroom first."
我...那个，"她有些迟疑地说，"我得先上个厕所。

This earned her a dismissive wave from the man, who was already quickly walking over to the elevator, and a look of horror from Shinji. Before he could even begin to formulate a plan, the rope returned and he was being dragged along a corridor.
这让她换来了男人不屑的一挥手，那人已快步走向电梯，而真嗣则面露惊恐。他还没来得及构思对策，绳子便再次袭来，他被拖拽着穿过走廊。

To his great relief, he was just barely able to keep himself outside the room that Asuka walked into, but his back was almost literally right against the wall. Shinji did not want to test what would happen if the rope tried to pull him through solid objects.
他深感庆幸，自己勉强没有被拉进明日香进入的房间，背部几乎紧贴着墙壁。真嗣可不想冒险，看看绳子是否能将他拉穿实体。

Several very awkward minutes later, Asuka emerged and set off back the way they came. In the lobby, she headed for the elevators and pressed the call button. A door immediately opened and Asuka and Shinji stepped inside. Asuka reached for the buttons, but her questing fingers stopped just short of what Shinji assumed was the floor her mother was residing on. Quickly working out which button she was aiming for, he pressed it, causing Asuka to look around the elevator car confusedly for a moment.
几分钟后，尴尬至极，明日香走了出来，沿着原路返回。在大厅，她直奔电梯并按下呼叫键。门立即开启，明日香和真嗣步入其中。明日香伸手欲按楼层按钮，却在即将触碰到真嗣猜测是她母亲所在楼层的按钮时停住了。真嗣迅速领会她的意图，替她按下按钮，使得明日香在电梯内困惑地环顾四周。

Despite this being merely a memory, Shinji still felt that same weird feeling in his stomach as the elevator accelerated and then came to a stop. The door opened with a ding and Asuka, with no adult in sight to tell her otherwise, began running down the corridor. At least this time, Shinji was ready for it. The corridor seemed to stretch on forever, and the roof seemed to gradually rise higher and higher. But he kept his focus on the girl, easily matching her pace until she skidded to a halt in front of a door, the label stating that its occupant was one Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu.
虽然这只是一段回忆，但当电梯加速后停下时，真嗣依旧感到胃里那种异样的感觉。随着“叮”的一声，门开了，没有大人在场制止，明日香便沿着走廊奔跑起来。至少这次，真嗣有所准备。走廊仿佛没有尽头，屋顶也似乎在缓缓升高。然而他紧跟在女孩身后，轻松地与她同步，直至她在标着“绫波丽”的门前猛地停下。

Asuka took a moment to straighten out her dress and run a hand through her hair, then cleared her throat and began to open the door.
明日香稍作停顿，整理了一下裙摆，顺手理了理头发，接着清了清嗓子，这才推门而入。

"Mama!" she exclaimed, her voice full of joy. "You'll never guess what happened to-"
妈妈！"她激动地喊道，声音洋溢着喜悦。"你肯定猜不到发生了什么-

The door swung open, the interior of the room almost pitch black despite the time of day. A modicum of light seeped in through a partially closed curtain, washing over an upright figure that...
门突然敞开，房间内几乎漆黑一片，即便是在白天。一缕光线透过半掩的窗帘透进来，照亮了一个直立的身影，那身影...

That was... 那真是...

Shinji covered his mouth in shock, unable to tear his gaze away, and heard a horrified gasp from next to him.
真嗣惊愕地捂住嘴，目光无法移开，耳边传来一声惊恐的吸气声。

Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu was hanging from the ceiling. And right next to her another noose dangled; at the end of it was a doll clad in red, its head almost torn off.
绢野绫波正悬挂在天花板上，旁边另一根绳索上挂着一个红衣玩偶，其头部几乎断裂。

"...M...mama...?" ...妈妈...？

Somehow, Asuka's voice, bordering on hysterical, managed to inject some life into Shinji's limbs. His body moving almost on its own, he slammed the door closed before scooping the petrified girl up into his arms.
不知何故，明日香那近乎失控的声音，竟奇迹般地让真嗣的四肢恢复了些许生气。他几乎是不由自主地行动起来，迅速关上门，然后将那惊恐的女孩紧紧抱在怀里。

He backpedalled away from the door, his spine soon impacting the wall behind him. Sliding down to sit on the floor, he held Asuka as tightly as he could.
他倒退着离开门，脊背不久便撞上了背后的墙。顺着墙滑坐到地上，他尽可能紧地抱住明日香。

It was only now, as he slid down to sit on the ground, that he realised exactly what he had just done. A small pair of arms slowly curled around the back of his neck. The girl let out a sniffle and Shinji, feeling his shirt slowly dampen, let his own begin to fall as well.
直到此刻，他颓然坐地，才彻底明白自己刚才的所作所为。一双纤细的胳膊缓缓搂住了他的脖颈。女孩轻声抽噎，真嗣感到衬衫被泪水浸湿，自己的泪也止不住地流了下来。

And then, on the absolute edge of his hearing, Shinji heard a man and woman begin to moan. Asuka stiffened in his arms, her head jerkily turning towards the sound.
随后，在真嗣听力的极限处，他察觉到一男一女开始发出呻吟声。他怀中的明日香身体突然僵硬，头急促地转向声音传来的方向。

There had been no doors in the corridor until Asuka had reached this one. And right next to the door leading to... that, one other door sat in the wall. There was no label on it, but it was the only other door in the entire corridor.
直到抵达这扇门之前，走廊里原本空无一门。紧邻着通往...那处的门旁，墙上还嵌着另一扇门，它静静地立在那里。门上未贴任何标识，却是走廊中仅有的另一扇门。

Realisation dawned. Asuka said that her father had married a nurse. The man that had been in the car with them had gone ahead in the hospital. Asuka had been barely able to hide her disgust at the man.
恍然大悟。明日香透露，她的父亲与一位护士再婚了。之前与他们同车的男子已先行前往医院。明日香对那人难掩厌恶之情。

The man was cheating on his wife, in the hospital room right next to where she had just killed herself.
那男人在医院里背叛了他的妻子，就在她刚刚结束自己生命的隔壁病房。

The muffled sounds of rising passion made Shinji grit his teeth in rage; the hatred dried his tears in a flash. He stood up, ready to burst into the room, until he remembered two very important things: this was merely a memory, and he was holding the owner of that memory in his arms. His anger settled down into a simmer, and he stomped off down the corridor, only stopping when the two doors were well out of sight. With those noises out of their ears, Asuka's tears began anew, and Shinji absently began to rub a hand up and down her back.
激昂情感的压抑声响让真嗣咬紧牙关，怒火瞬间蒸发了他的泪水。他站起身，正要冲进房间，却突然想起两件重要的事：这不过是一段记忆，而他正抱着这段记忆的主人。怒气渐消，他沿着走廊愤然离去，直到两扇门彻底消失在视线之外才停下。随着那些声响从耳边消失，明日香的泪水再次涌出，真嗣则无意识地开始轻抚她的背。

A battered wall, which had held up for a decade, began to crack and crumble.
一面饱经十年风霜的墙壁，开始裂纹密布，逐渐瓦解。

"I'm... I'm sorry, Asuka," he murmured into her hair. "I'm so... so sorry..."
明日香，我...我很抱歉，" 他轻声呢喃，声音融入她的发间。"真的，我非常...非常抱歉...

Chunks of the wall fell off, dissolving into dust. Through the gaps in the wall, a purple giant stood on the other side of a window.
墙体碎片纷纷脱落，化为尘土。透过墙壁的缝隙，可见一个紫色巨人矗立在窗外。

The girl in his arms gasped, and two red-rimmed eyes looked up at him. "Wh... you..." she stammered, before shaking her head and trying again. "...Who... are you?"
他怀里的女孩喘了口气，一双红肿的眼睛仰望着他。"你...你..."她结结巴巴地说着，摇了摇头，再次尝试，"...你是谁？"

The wall completely disintegrated, revealing a control room, a distorted face on a computer screen, and a small boy.
墙壁彻底瓦解，显露出一个控制室，电脑屏幕上浮现出一张扭曲的面孔，旁边还站着一个小孩。

Shinji sighed. "I'm really nobody special," he quietly replied, remaining stoic for her sake even as his head erupted in pain. "Just think of me as... a kindred spirit."
真嗣叹了口气，轻声说道：“我真的没什么特别的。”他为了她保持着镇定，尽管头痛如绞。“就把我当作……一个灵魂相通的人吧。”

'You will make it through this. Good luck.'
'你一定能挺过这一关。祝你好运。'

Bwynvienne's words of encouragement rang in Asuka's ears as she stared down at the brown-haired boy next to her in the elevator. Whatever the damn Angel up in orbit was doing, it had managed to merge her's and Shinji's minds even more than they had been in the past. While she wasn't exactly violently opposed to the notion, things were already at maximum levels of weird and awkward between them.
布温维妮的鼓励声在明日香耳畔回荡，她低头凝视着电梯中身旁的棕发少年。无论那轨道上的可恶天使有何企图，它已将她和真嗣的心灵融合得比以往更为紧密。虽然她并非全然抗拒这一变化，但两人间的关系已变得异常微妙且尴尬。

And now she was in Shinji's past. Sort of.
如今，她仿佛置身于真嗣的过往之中。可以说是这样。

The elevator dinged, the doors opened, and the woman holding young Shinji's hand stepped out into the corridor, walking slowly so that the boy could keep up with his short legs. Asuka also exited the elevator, but stopped and looked at the two of them walk off... until some sort of invisible rope began to inexorably tug her along the corridor behind them.
电梯发出叮的一声，门缓缓开启，一位女士牵着小真嗣的手步出电梯，她放慢脚步，以便男孩能跟上他那短小的步伐。明日香也跟着走出电梯，却驻足凝视着他们渐行渐远……直到一股无形的力量开始牵引她，不由自主地沿着走廊跟随他们。

Of course. This was Shinji's memory; a child like him would have no real knowledge of things outside a certain range, so she was forced to stay with him. Out of curiosity, Asuka sped up to pass them so that she could look at the woman who was probably Yui Ikari. One glance at the face proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt; she looked like an adult, female version of Shinji.
自然，这是真嗣的记忆；他这样的孩子对超出一定范围的事物知之甚少，所以她不得不与他相伴。出于好奇，明日香加快了速度，想要超过他们，以便一睹那位极有可能是碇唯的女性的真容。仅一眼，她的面容就确凿无疑地表明了她的身份；她宛如成年女性版的真嗣。

Asuka frowned. Yui Ikari also somewhat resembled... Rei Ayanami? She made a mental note to take a closer look at both Wondergirl and Shinji the next time they were in the same room.
明日香眉头紧锁。碇唯的模样也隐约与绫波丽相似...她心中暗记，下次绫波和真嗣同在一室时，定要仔细端详二人。

Realisation struck her; she could actually see the face of Shinji's mother, something that he had been struggling with for most of his life. Walking backwards down the corridor, Asuka did her best to commit Yui's features to memory, before the woman stopped in front of a metal door. Now that she was paying close attention, Yui Ikari seemed strangely tall, towering over Shinji -and Asuka- more than she should be. Asuka looked around the corridor, and realised the ceiling was much higher than normal.
她恍然大悟，自己竟能目睹真嗣母亲的面容，这是他长久以来苦苦追寻的。她倒退着走在走廊上，努力将唯的容貌铭记于心，直到那位女士在一扇金属门前驻足。此刻她凝神细看，发现碇唯异常高大，远超真嗣——以及她自己。她环视四周，察觉到走廊的天花板异常高耸。

It took a moment, but then she slapped a hand to her forehead in realisation. This was the memory of a child. Back then, everything seemed much bigger. Even the door they were standing in front of stretched up far beyond the top of Asuka's head, with a card reader next to the door somewhere around her eye level.
片刻后，她恍然大悟，拍了拍自己的额头。这是儿时的记忆，那时一切都显得格外庞大。他们所站的门前，那扇门高耸入云，远超飞鸟的头顶，旁边还有一个与她眼睛齐平的读卡器。

Yui swiped a card through the reader, which beeped and opened the door. Inside the room, also disturbingly big, were probably a dozen other people, including two that Asuka could easily recognise: Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki. They were all abnormally tall too. Someone who looked like a dark-haired Doctor Akagi, probably her mother, was also there, and sighed upon turning around and spotting Yui and Shinji.
绫波将卡片在读卡器上一刷，随着哔的一声，门应声而开。房间内空间同样大得让人不安，里面约有十几个人，明日香一眼就认出了其中的碇源堂和冬月幸增。他们也都异常高大。还有一位看起来像是黑发的赤木博士，很可能是她的母亲，她转过身来看到绫波和真嗣时，不禁叹了口气。

"Really, Yui?" she said. "You're bringing your son in here? Why?"
真的吗，Yui？你要把儿子带进来？这是为什么？

"We are on the verge of something amazing," replied Yui. "I brought Shinji along to show him the bright future ahead of us."
我们即将迎来非凡的时刻，" Yui 回应说。"我带 Shinji 来，是为了让他看看我们前方的光明前景。

Akagi glanced at the other Ikari adult. "And you're fine with this too, I take it?"
赤木看向另一位碇的成年人，问道：“看来你也同意这样安排？”

Gendo Ikari turned around, and Asuka recoiled slightly at how... different the eventual Commander of NERV looked. No glasses, no beard, and an expression of something other then stiff impassivity. Asuka was honestly surprised Shinji had somehow managed to remember these features, considering his relationship with his father.
源渡转过身来，明日香不禁微微一缩，眼前的 NERV 最终指挥官竟如此不同。他没戴眼镜，没有胡须，表情也不再是往日的僵硬冷漠。明日香着实惊讶，真嗣居然能记得这些细节，考虑到他与父亲的关系。

"If she wants to let him watch, I have no problem with it," he said with the slightest of grins. "Just try and stop her when her mind's set on something."
如果她决定让他看，我完全没意见，"他微微一笑说。"她一旦决定做什么，谁也拦不住。

Yui smiled at her husband, then let young Shinji's hand go and squatted down next to him. The motion made Asuka's eyes water as the woman both seemed to shrink while remaining the same size. "I need to go now, and do my part. You'll be able to watch from in here, but don't touch anything. Okay?"
结城对丈夫微微一笑，随后松开小真嗣的手，蹲在他身旁。这一举动让明日香的眼眶泛起了泪光，仿佛这位女士在缩小，却又保持着原有的身形。“我得去尽我的责任了。你们可以在这里观看，但切记不要触碰任何东西。好吗？”

Shinji nodded. "'kay Mama," he replied, looking around the room in awe. After swiftly getting over just how adorable he sounded, Asuka took in the room as well. Most of it was computer terminals, but one wall of the room was actually a giant window. And on the other side of the window was...
真嗣点头应道：“好的，妈妈。”他一边回答，一边带着惊叹环视四周。明日香也很快从他那可爱的声音中回过神来，开始观察房间。房间里大多是电脑终端，但其中一面墙却是一扇巨大的窗户。透过窗户，可以看到...

Evangelion Unit-01. Looking far more gigantic than in real life. Asuka's eyes narrowed in suspicion. Some kind of test was clearly happening here. Was it... the first attempt to actually pilot an Evangelion?
初号机。比现实中更显庞大。明日香的目光锐利起来，带着疑虑。这里显然在进行某种测试。难道这是……首次尝试真正驾驶初号机？

Yui's smile widened, and she gave the young Shinji a hug and a kiss on the forehead. "That's my boy!" She stood up and looked at her husband and Fuyutsuki. "Look after him for me while I'm gone, please?"
结城结弦的笑容愈发灿烂，她紧紧拥抱了年幼的真嗣，并在他额头上留下一吻。“真不愧是我的孩子！”她站起身，目光转向丈夫和冬月。“我离开期间，请替我照看好他，好吗？”

"Of course," said Fuyutsuki. "We'll make sure he doesn't get into any trouble."
当然，"福音寺说道，"我们会确保他不会惹上麻烦。

Shinji watched her leave, then turned to his father. "What's Mama doing?" he asked.
真嗣目送她离去后，转向父亲问道：“妈妈在忙什么呢？”

In response, the elder Ikari pointed out the window at Unit-01. "She's going to get into that," he said. "Your mother's going to help us see if we can make it work."
老碇随即指向窗外的一号机，说道：“她将进入那台机体。你母亲会协助我们，看能否让它启动。”

Evidently seeing the Evangelion for the first time, Shinji ambled over to the window, putting his face right against the glass. "Whoah," he breathed, fogging the window up. "Big thing." Presumably because it wasn't actually doing anything yet, he immediately lost interest and began to wander around the room, looking at all the adults seated at their stations.
显然是初次目睹福音战士，真嗣缓缓走向窗边，脸紧贴着玻璃。“哇，”他轻声惊叹，呼出的气息让窗户蒙上一层雾。“真是个大家伙。”或许是因为它尚未有所动作，他很快便失去了兴趣，开始在室内游荡，打量着坐在各自岗位上的成年人。

Asuka sighed as she kept pace with the boy, remembering that Shinji didn't have her experience with Evangelions. Around this age, she already knew about them and was doing her best to get chosen as the pilot of Unit-02.
明日香叹了口气，与男孩并肩前行，意识到真嗣并不像她那样熟悉福音战士。在这个年纪，她早已对它们了如指掌，并全力以赴争取成为二号机的驾驶员。

The voices of the adults were now seemingly muffled. Their mouths were moving, sound was coming out, but Asuka couldn't make out a single word. It didn't take long for her to realise that it was another artifact of Shinji's memory; while he knew they were talking, he was too young to understand anything. And, she had to admit, if it had been her in the boy's place things would have likely been the same. After all, she wouldn't have had her college degree yet.
成年人的声音此刻似乎变得含糊不清。他们的嘴巴在动，声音传出，但明日香却听不清任何一个字。她很快意识到，这是真嗣记忆中的又一现象；尽管他知道他们在说话，但他年纪尚小，无法理解任何内容。而且，她不得不承认，如果换作是她处在那个男孩的位置，情况可能也会一样。毕竟，她那时还没有大学学位。

After a few minutes a computer screen near the window changed to show Yui Ikari in the entry plug. She was wearing something like a plugsuit, only more bulky around the torso. Yui shifted around in her seat, then announced, "I'm ready in here."
几分钟后，窗边的电脑屏幕切换画面，显示碇唯正坐在插入栓内。她身着类似插入服的装备，但躯干部位显得更为臃肿。碇唯在座位上稍作调整，随即宣告：“我这里已经准备就绪。”

Upon hearing his mother, Shinji moved to stand in front of the computer screen, staring up at it. "Hi Mama!" he called out, eliciting a smile from Yui.
听到妈妈的声音，真嗣走到电脑屏幕前，抬头凝视着。“妈妈，你好！”他喊道，唯的脸上露出了微笑。

"Hello again dear," she replied.
"亲爱的，你好呀，"她回应说。

"This is your last chance to change your mind," Gendo interjected, walking up behind Shinji. "We can still get someone else to do the test."
这是你最后改变主意的机会，"源渡从后面走近真嗣，插话道。"我们还能找别人来做测试。

"No, sweetheart," said Yui, the smile fading as she stared at her husband. "It has to be me. Somebody else might get it wrong."
不，亲爱的，" Yui 说着，笑容渐渐褪去，她专注地看着丈夫。"只能是我来。换作别人可能会搞错。

Gendo sighed. He picked up Shinji and set him on the seat in front of the screen. "Fine, but we're keeping our hand on the shutdown switch. If we even think something is going wrong we're aborting."
源渡叹了口气，抱起真嗣放在屏幕前的座位上。“行吧，不过我们的手要一直放在紧急停止开关上。只要感觉有异样，立刻中止。”

"I wouldn't expect any less from you."
你做得再好我也不会感到意外。

The muffled voices returned as the team went through what was most likely an activation test. Knowing she would get no information from them or their computers, Asuka kept her focus on Shinji. He clearly understood something important was going on, his gaze alternating between his mother on the screen and Unit-01, but if he was anxious about what was going on, it didn't show.
当团队进行疑似激活测试时，那些低沉的声音又回来了。明日香清楚从他们或电脑那里得不到任何信息，于是她专注地观察着真嗣。他显然意识到有重大事情发生，目光在屏幕上的母亲和零号机之间游移，尽管如此，若他感到焦虑，也并未显露出来。

And then alarms began to blare.
紧接着，警报声大作。

Muffled voices became muffled shouts, the entire room filling with noise. None of the adults, not even Gendo, were moving; Shinji's attention was fixed firmly on the computer screen and so as far as he was concerned, nothing else in the room even existed.
低沉的说话声逐渐转为低沉的呼喊，整个房间充斥着嘈杂声。在场的成年人，包括源堂在内，都未有动作；真嗣的目光牢牢锁定在电脑屏幕上，对他而言，房间中的其他一切似乎都不复存在。

"M-Mama?" he called out, a tiny hand reaching for the screen.
"妈……妈？" 他轻声呼唤，一只小手伸向屏幕。

Yui grimaced, but forced a smile back on her face. "Don't... don't worry about me, Shinji," she said through gritted teeth. "Everything's going to be... okay. This... is the path... to a bright future."
绫波皱了皱眉，却还是勉强露出了微笑。“别……别为我担心，真嗣，”她咬紧牙关说道，“一切都会……好起来的。这……正是通往光明未来的路。”

Asuka blinked, then focused intently on Yui's face. Her skin seemed to be... peeling away? Disintegrating? Had the LCL somehow turned acidic and started eating away at her? The pinkness of her skin was steadily being replaced with the red of raw flesh. As Shinji began to cry and shout for his mother, his hands all over the screen as if trying to reach through it, Asuka slapped a hand over her mouth in horror.
明日香眨了眨眼，随后紧盯着绫波的脸庞。她的皮肤似乎正在剥落，甚至消解。难道是 LCL 突然变得具有腐蚀性，开始侵蚀她的肌肤？那原本粉嫩的肤色正逐渐被鲜红的血肉所替代。当真嗣开始哭泣并呼唤母亲时，他的双手在屏幕上乱抓，仿佛要穿透屏幕去触碰，明日香惊恐地用手捂住了自己的嘴。

The Evangelion was absorbing Yui Ikari.
初号机正在吞噬碇唯。

Her stomach began to roil as the process continued, unable to tear her gaze away from the shocking spectacle even when bone began to appear. But throughout the entire thing, Yui refused to let any pain show, keeping her gaze locked onto her son while being dissolved alive. After what felt like an eternity, something seemed to finally give out as Yui's entire body came apart at the molecular level, and she was no more.
随着过程的推进，她的胃开始翻腾，即便骨头逐渐显露，她的目光也始终无法从这骇人的场景上移开。然而，整个过程中，Yui 始终保持着坚毅，不露一丝痛苦，她的目光紧紧锁定在儿子身上，直至自己被活生生地溶解。仿佛经历了无尽的时光，终于，某种极限被突破，Yui 的身体在分子层面分崩离析，她就此消逝。

Asuka eventually noticed that her entire body was shaking like a tree in a hurricane. She tore her gaze away from the screen, but it was far, far too late. The rest of the room was silent. Whether due to that being the case back when it actually happened or because Shinji was laser-focused on one thing, it didn't matter-
明日香终于察觉到自己的身体如同飓风中的树木般颤抖不已。她艰难地将视线从屏幕上移开，然而为时已晚。房间内鸦雀无声，或许是当时情景的真实写照，亦或是真嗣正全神贯注于某事，这一切都已不再重要——

Shinji... 真嗣……

The crying young boy was screaming at the screen, tearfully begging for his mother to come back. But, Asuka grimly thought, there would be no rescuing Yui Ikari. She was now trapped within Unit-01, alone for a decade until Shinji returned to Tokyo-3 and became its pilot.
哭泣的小男孩对着屏幕尖叫，泪眼婆娑地哀求母亲归来。然而，明日香心中明白，碇唯已无法获救。她被困在零号机中，孤身一人，需待十年后真嗣重返第三新东京市，成为其驾驶员。

Something completely bypassed Asuka's brain, sending her towards the boy. Something made her gently pick young Shinji up, pulling him away from the screen, then turn him around and hug him to her chest. Something made her walk out of that room, not looking back. But as a small pair of arms gingerly wrapped around the back of her neck, she was fairly sure that it was her own decision to slowly rub a hand up and down Shinji's back, and that it was her own decision to let her tears join his.
某种力量完全绕过了明日香的思考，驱使她走向男孩。这股力量让她温柔地抱起年幼的真嗣，将他从屏幕前移开，然后转过他的身体，紧紧拥入怀中。这股力量让她离开了那个房间，没有回头。然而，当一双小手臂轻轻环抱住她的脖子时，她确信，轻抚真嗣背部的手，以及让泪水与他交融的决定，都是她自己的选择。

"I'm... I'm sorry, Shinji," she murmured into his hair. "I'm so... so sorry..."
真嗣，对不起，" 她轻声说道，声音中带着歉意。"我真的很...很对不起...

The boy in her arms gasped, and two red-rimmed eyes looked up at her. "Wh... you..." he stammered, before shaking his head and trying again. "...Who... are you?"
她怀里的男孩喘着粗气，一双红肿的眼睛向上望着她。“你...你...”他结结巴巴地说，随后摇摇头，重新问道：“...你是谁？”

Asuka sighed. "I'm really nobody special," she quietly replied, remaining stoic for his sake. "Just think of me as... a kindred spirit."
明日香轻叹一声，低声道：“我其实很普通，”她为了他保持着冷静，“就当我是……一个心灵相通的人吧。”

...a kindred spirit. ...一位志趣相投的伙伴。

Asuka's head shot up. Someone, or something, had just echoed her words. The corridor was fading into blackness; she turned around, Shinji still held tight in her arms, but there was nothing. Nobody. The memory had... ended? She relaxed a tiny fraction; at this point she wouldn't be surprised if the damn Angel itself decided to pop up to have a chat.
明日香猛地抬头，似乎有人或什么东西重复了她的言语。走廊正逐渐被黑暗吞噬；她转身，怀里仍紧抱着真嗣，然而四周空无一人。记忆似乎戛然而止？她略微松了口气；此时此刻，即便那可恶的使徒突然现身来搭话，她也不会感到意外。

"In that case, you shouldn't be surprised to see me then."
那样的话，你看到我就不该感到意外了。

Asuka whirled around. That was definitely a person's voice, and a very familiar one at that. And indeed, as she expected, Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu was standing there, arms folded in front of her.
明日香猛地转身。那无疑是人的声音，且极为熟悉。不出所料，绫波丽·齐柏林-索龙正站在那里，双臂抱在胸前。

"Hello, darling," she said, walking up and placing a hand on Asuka's shoulder. "Sorry it took so long for me to get here. I've been trying to keep you and Shinji-" she glanced at the boy in Asuka's arms before continuing "-protected. Something's happened just now, though, and the Angel's attack has stopped."
你好，亲爱的，"她边说边走近，一只手搭在明日香肩上。"抱歉我来迟了。我一直尽力保护你和真嗣——"她看了一眼明日香怀里的男孩，接着说，"——现在情况有变，使徒的攻击已经停止了。

"Something?" Asuka echoed. "What kind of something?"
什么事？" 明日香反问道。"你指的是什么？

"I can't say," Mama replied with a helpless shrug. "Unit-02's pretty much dead in the water from feedback. Literally all I can sense right now is you two." She cast another glance at young Shinji. The corner of her mouth tilted up the slightest fraction of an inch. "But it looks like you've had an... interesting time."
我真说不上来，"妈妈无奈地耸肩回应，"二号机因为反馈问题几乎动弹不得。现在我只能感觉到你们俩。"她再次望向年轻的真嗣，嘴角微不可察地上扬。"看来你们经历了一段挺有意思的时光。

Asuka looked down at Shinji. He seemed to have frozen, still looking up at her and not reacting to her mother's presence. He was still there, as her arms would attest, but seemingly no longer... active. "I... saw into his past," she said to Mama. "It was... what happened to his mother."
明日香俯视着真嗣，他仿佛凝固了，依旧仰望着她，对她的母亲在场毫无反应。尽管他还在那里，她的手臂能感受到，但似乎已不再……有任何动作。“我……窥见了他的过往，”她对母亲说。“那是关于他母亲的事。”

Mama's arms dropped to her sides. "...Oh dear," she murmured. "I'm not going to like what happened, am I?"
妈妈的双臂无力地垂下，她喃喃道：“...哎呀，看来我不会喜欢这发生的事了，对吧？”

Indeed, when Asuka related what she had experienced, it was clear that Mama hated what had occurred. Mama put a hand to her forehead and sighed. "So... that explains a whole hell of a lot."
确实，当明日香叙述她的遭遇时，妈妈对所发生的一切显然感到憎恶。她用手撑着额头，深深叹了口气。“原来如此...难怪会有这么多问题。”

"What?" Asuka raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"
什么？" 明日香眉头一挑，"你指的是什么？

Kyoko turned slightly and took a few steps in a random direction, staring at nothing. "My attempt at activating Unit-02 came only a few months after the apparent failure of Unit-01. I thought I had discovered and fixed what went wrong, why Yui had seemingly died in her attempt, and decided to do it 'properly' myself." She stopped, her eyes darting sideways to land on Asuka. "But the thing is... Yui's attempt didn't fail."
京子稍稍侧身，漫无目的地走了几步，眼神空洞。“我尝试激活二号机，是在一号机看似失败后的短短几个月。我自认为找到了问题根源，修复了唯尝试失败的原因，决心自己要‘正确’地进行。”她停下脚步，目光突然转向明日香。“但事实是……唯的尝试并未失败。”

Part of Asuka wanted to angrily refute that claim, but the fresh memory of the event held out a hand, presenting crucial evidence. Specifically, Yui Ikari's reaction to what was happening to her. "...She knew what would happen," she slowly said. "Yui wasn't surprised or anything by the Eva absorbing her. She was expecting it."
明日香心中有一股冲动想要愤怒地驳斥这种说法，但刚刚的事件记忆犹新，伸出了关键证据之手。特别是，碇唯对所发生事情的反应。“……她预见到了这一切，”她缓缓地说道。“碇唯对 EVA 将她吸收并不感到意外。她早有心理准备。”

Mama nodded, a grim smile growing on her face. "That's my daughter. Yes, Yui planned it all like that, because she knew what I only found out after the fact: Evangelions need a human soul in their core, and the pilot connects with that soul in order to be able to control it."
母亲点了点头，脸上露出一丝苦涩的微笑。“那正是我的女儿。没错，唯事先就策划好了，因为她清楚我后来才得知的事实：福音战士的核心必须融入人类灵魂，驾驶员通过与这个灵魂相连才能操控它。”

"...Wait a minute," Asuka interrupted, her eyes narrowing. "Something doesn't add up. You're saying you also died trying to activate an Evangelion, right?"
...等等，" 明日香插话道，眼神锐利起来。"这里面有些不对劲。你的意思是，你也因为尝试启动 EVA 而丧命，对吗？

"...Yes?" Mama replied uncertainly. "The last thing I remember before waking up inside Unit-02 was sitting in the entry plug." She tilted her head to one side. "Why?"
...怎么了？"妈妈有些迟疑地回应。"我只记得在二号机内醒来前，正坐在插入栓里。"她侧着头，疑惑地问。"有什么问题吗？

Before Asuka could respond, another voice reached their ears.
Asuka 还未来得及回应，另一个声音便传入了他们的耳中。

"Because Asuka remembers your death very differently."
因为明日香对你的死亡记忆大相径庭。

Both redheads turned. Both redheads let out a gasp of surprise.
两位红发人同时转身，都惊讶得倒吸了一口凉气。

It was Shinji, staring at Mama with ice in his eyes... and just as Asuka was carrying a young version of him, he was carrying a young version of her.
那是真嗣，目光冰冷地凝视着母亲……正如明日香怀抱着幼时的他，他同样怀抱着幼时的她。

"Oh... well..." Mama glumly remarked, staring at the girl in his arms. "I do believe things just got a lot more complicated..."
哦... 这个..." 妈妈有些沮丧地看着他怀中的女孩，说道："看来事情变得更加棘手了...

"That's one way of putting it," Shinji remarked with a snort as he walked around Mama to stand next to Asuka. He glanced at her, and at the boy she was carrying, and his cheeks pinked up. "Hi, Asuka. It looks like you've had a similar time to me."
这么说也是一种方式，" 真嗣哼了一声，绕过妈妈走到明日香身边。他看了看她，还有她怀里的男孩，脸颊微微泛红。"嗨，明日香。看来我们的遭遇颇为相似。

Asuka shakily nodded; he had seen the worst moment of her life when she was younger, and vice versa. Well, if it had to be someone, she was happy -or at least not upset- that it was Shinji. After all, she had been planning to tell him about her past. Eventually. One day. "Yeah," she mumbled, looking at her younger self. "So... you know now... what I went through."
明日香颤抖着点了点头；他曾见证她年少时最黑暗的时刻，反之亦然。也好，若非得是某人，她庆幸——或至少不反感——那是真嗣。毕竟，她本就打算向他坦白自己的过往。终有一天。"嗯，"她含糊地说，凝视着年轻的自己。"所以...你现在知道了...我所经历的一切。"

"And, perhaps thanks to you," replied Shinji, rubbing at his forehead, "I now remember my own past."
或许得感谢你，" 新二边说边揉额头，"我这才回忆起了自己的过去。

"...What?" Asuka almost dropped young Shinji in surprise. "You... got your own memory back?!"
...什么？" 明日香惊得差点没抱住小真嗣。"你... 找回了自己的记忆？

"I remember it all now. Even my mother's face." Shinji's mouth turned upward in a bittersweet smile. "And... Asuka?"
我现在全都记起来了，包括母亲的面容。" 真嗣嘴角勾起一抹苦笑。"那么...明日香呢？

Asuka blinked, and his smile... changed, becoming much warmer.
明日香眨了眨眼，笑容随之转变，变得愈发温暖亲切。

"...Thank you." ...谢谢。

"W-what?" she stammered. "I didn't even do anything except watch!"
什么？"她结巴着说，"我只不过是在旁边看着而已！

"No, but..." Shinji pointed his free hand at her. Or to be more specific, his younger self. "Of course, that never happened in reality... but the fact that you did that for... um... sort-of-me... I really appreciate it."
不，但是……" 真嗣用另一只手指向她，实际上是指向年幼的自己。"当然，现实中那并未发生……但你能为……算是我吧……做那件事，我真的很感激。

Her face was suddenly hot enough to melt an Evangelion's armour. "U-uh... you're welcome?" She shook her head vigorously as a thought occurred. "Well... in that case!" She got a hand free and returned the favour, pointing at her own younger self. "T-thank you, for looking after not-quite-me."
她的脸颊突然热得仿佛能融化福音战士的装甲。"呃...不客气？"她猛地摇头，一个念头掠过脑海。"那么...既然如此！"她抽出一只手，同样指向年幼的自己，以示回礼。"谢...谢谢你，照顾了尚未成熟的我。"

They stood there for a moment, pointing at each other with a child held to their chest, until a high-pitched sound reminded them that somebody else was in the vicinity. Their hands dropped to their sides for a moment, before quickly moving to support the weight of their respective child and looking at the source of the sound.
他们站在那儿，各自抱着孩子，互相指着对方，直到一声尖锐的响声提醒他们附近还有其他人。他们的手先是垂下，随即迅速抬起，稳稳托住各自孩子的重量，并转头寻找声音的来源。

Mama, standing there with an ecstatic look on her face, tried to cover herself with a heavy cough. When both teenagers raised an eyebrow at the same time, she shrugged. "I'm sorry, I was trying to keep it in since this is a serious situation, but you two..." She held out both hands, gesturing specifically at the children they were holding. "You just look so... perfect like that!"
妈妈站在那儿，脸上洋溢着狂喜，却用一阵重咳来掩饰自己。两个青少年同时挑眉，她便耸了耸肩。“抱歉，我本想忍住，毕竟这情况挺严肃的，但你们俩……”她双手一摊，特别指向他们怀中的孩子。“你们这样子，真是太完美了！”

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other, confusion on their faces, until realisation struck Asuka like a charging Angel. Her eyes widened, her head reared back, and she almost let go of the boy in her arms. Yet, despite knowing that the two four-year-olds were nothing more than fragments of terrible pasts that were currently... inactive, she maintained her hold.
真嗣与明日香目光交汇，面露迷茫，直到明日香如被使徒猛击般豁然开朗。她双眼圆睁，头部后仰，险些松开怀抱中的男孩。尽管清楚这两个四岁孩童只是过往恐怖记忆的残片，此刻处于...静止状态，她依旧没有放手。

"...Oh..." It seemed Shinji took a few seconds longer to work it out, and his face was now as red as her hair. He soon recovered, and looked down at her younger self. "Wait... why are they still here? We're not even in the memories anymore."
...哦..." 看来真嗣比她多花了点时间才明白过来，他的脸红得跟她的发色一样。他很快回过神来，低头看向她年幼的模样。"等等...为什么他们还在这里？我们早已不在记忆里了。

"I know more about the Evas than both of you," said Mama, drawing their attention back to her. "But even I can't explain that one. But if I may, can we please get back to something far more important?"
我对 Evas 的了解远超你们二人，"妈妈说道，将他们的注意力重新引向自己。"然而，那个问题我也解释不清。不过，若能容我一言，我们是否可以回到一个更为紧要的话题上？

Oh. Right. Asuka readjusted her grip on 'her' child and cleared her throat. "Yes. Let's absolutely discuss that. Shinji." She turned to him, continuing when he made a questioning noise. "You saw... that. In the hospital. But Mama is insisting that she died during Unit-02's activation."
哦，对。明日香调整了一下抱着“她的”孩子的姿势，清了清嗓子。“没错，我们得谈谈这事。真嗣。”她转向他，在他发出疑问声时接着说。“你在医院看到了……那情景。但妈妈坚称她是在二号机启动时去世的。”

"Yes," agreed Shinji. "You... back then I mean, were going to meet her that day. The memory didn't reveal anything about why she... did that. The only other thing that happened was... ah... noises from the next room."
真嗣赞同地说：“对，你那时本打算那天见她。记忆并未揭示她为何做出那种行为。除此之外，只记得隔壁房间传来了些声响。”

Asuka's teeth unconsciously gritted in anger, to the point she had to concentrate on forcing them to part. "Yes," she ground out. Looking at Mama, who was staring confusedly back at her, she said, "That bastard father of mine was fucking the nurse assigned to your care when you were admitted."
明日香因愤怒不自觉地咬紧了牙关，她得努力集中精神才能让牙齿松开。"没错，"她恨恨地说。她看着妈妈困惑的眼神，继续道："你住院期间，我那混账父亲居然和照顾你的护士搞在一起了。"

Kyoko's expression turned so thunderous that Asuka believed she was about to reach backwards in time to rip that asshole's balls off. "He. Did. WHAT?"
京子的脸色阴沉得可怕，明日香甚至觉得她要穿越时空去扯掉那混蛋的命根子。"他究竟干了什么？"

The nothingness around them began to shudder like an earthquake for a few seconds, threatening to drop the teenagers on their rear ends, before Mama squeezed her eyes shut and patted the air. "No. No. Not the most important thing right now. Go back to that bit about me having a nurse."
四周的空旷突然如地震般颤动了几秒，仿佛要将少年们摔倒在地，此时妈妈紧闭双眼，轻拍空气。“不，不，现在不是讨论这个的时候。还是回到我提到有个护士的那段吧。”

Asuka recovered her footing, and carefully said, "One day you went to work... and then the next thing I knew was that something had happened and you were put into a hospital-"
明日香稳住身形，谨慎地开口：“记得有天你照常去上班，谁知后来出了事，你被紧急送进了医院。”

The nothingness suddenly changed. Blackness gave way to dim light which slowly brightened, casting light on what quickly became a familiar corridor and a familiar door. Asuka and Shinji both looked at each other in shock, but then something inside the room caught her eye. Rather than the silhouette hanging from the ceiling, there was now a figure in the bed, sitting upright but looking down at something in its hands.
虚空骤然变幻，黑暗退去，微光渐起，缓缓照亮了熟悉的走廊与那扇熟悉的门。明日香与真嗣相视一惊，然而，房间内的某物吸引了她的目光。不再是悬于天花板的影子，此刻床上坐着一个人，正襟危坐，低头凝视手中的物件。

Mama turned to look at the figure, eyebrow raised high, and then cautiously walked into the room. Shinji looked about to follow, but then gestured with his head at Asuka that she should enter next. Mirroring her mother's trepidation, Asuka walked into the room that was forever scarred into her mind. She took up a spot next to the bed, barely noticing when Shinji stopped next to her.
母亲转头望向那人影，眉头一挑，随后谨慎地步入房间。真嗣本欲跟随，却用头示意明日香先行。明日香仿效母亲的谨慎，踏入了那个深深刻在记忆中的房间。她走到床边站定，几乎未察觉真嗣已悄然停在她身旁。

The figure on the bed was wreathed in shadow, but there was still enough light to make out who it was: Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu, but much... less than the real thing. The woman was skinny, the hospital-issue clothing practically hanging off of her, and a once glorious mane of hair haphazardly chopped back to the level of her neck. Seeing her mother's hair desecrated like that had, a decade ago, greatly upset a younger Asuka who had already decided that she wanted her own hair to be as long.
床上的人影被阴影环绕，但光线足以辨认出那是 Kyoko Zeppelin-Soryu，只是远不如真人那般。这位女士瘦骨嶙峋，医院发的衣服松垮垮地挂在身上，一头昔日华丽的秀发被胡乱剪至齐颈。十年前，年幼的 Asuka 看到母亲头发被糟蹋成这样，大为伤心，那时她已决心要让自己的头发也留得那么长。

"So..." Mama -the real Mama-, said. "Going by the existence of this memory, you're saying I didn't actually die."
"那么...”妈妈——真正的妈妈——说，“既然这段记忆存在，你的意思是，我其实并未离世。”

"No," said Asuka, grimly staring at the false Mama. "But you... changed. Badly. You... didn't seem to recognise me anymore." She pointed at the thing in the memory-woman's hands. "You started calling that Asuka."
不，"明日香冷冷地盯着假妈妈说，"但你变了，变得很糟糕。你似乎不再认得我了。"她指着那女人手中的东西，"你开始叫它明日香。

Mama leaned in close, and faded light began to illuminate the object. Shinji was quick to react, gasping in shock before looking down at the girl in his arms. The thing was a doll, clad in a red dress with a head of long red hair, with blue buttons for eyes. Both Shinji and Mama turned their heads to look at Asuka. Mama looked quizzical, but Shinji seemed... horrified?
妈妈凑近了，微弱的光线开始照亮那个物体。真嗣立刻反应过来，震惊地倒吸一口气，随即低头看向怀中的女孩。那是一只玩偶，身着红色连衣裙，一头长长的红发，用蓝色纽扣做眼睛。真嗣和妈妈都转头望向明日香。妈妈面露疑惑，而真嗣则显得……惊恐万分？

"Yeah," she muttered. "You believed that that doll was me. And no matter how much I begged and pleaded, you only saw me as a stranger."
是啊，" 她低声说，"你以为那个玩偶就是我。不管我怎么恳求，你都只把我当作陌生人。

"I... I don't remember any of this," Mama murmured. "Like I said, the last thing I remember was doing the test and then waking up trapped in the Eva. How did- ugh!"
我...我对这些毫无印象，"妈妈喃喃道。"正如我之前所说，我最后的记忆是做了测试，随后醒来发现自己被困在 Eva 中。怎么会这样- 呃！

She suddenly clasped a hand to her head, grunting in pain. Asuka tore her gaze away from that damn doll, quickly freeing up a hand to place on her mother's shoulder. "Mama? What's wrong?!"
她猛地捂住头，痛得哼出声来。明日香急忙将目光从那讨厌的玩偶上移开，迅速腾出手来搭在母亲肩上。“妈妈，怎么了？！”

"D... d... don't..." Mama's other hand was tightly clenching the rail at the end of the hospital bed, and her eyes were clenched shut. "Don't... d... di..."
D... d... 别... 妈妈另一只手紧紧抓着医院床尾的栏杆，双眼紧闭。“别... 死...”

Both Shinji and Asuka recoiled when her head suddenly shot up, her eyes now open and glowing a harsh yellow.
她的头猛地抬起，双眼睁开，射出刺目的黄色光芒，真嗣和明日香见状都不由自主地后退。

"̴̧̧͚͚͈̐D̵̻͌͆́͊i̶͎͐̏̒͂é̸̙͔ ̶̡͍̙͉͙̎͠w̷͕͔̩̞̓̈͝į̷̰̖̟̬͠ţ̶̹̰͐͗h̷̨͕̽ ̶͍̯̩̿͛̿̐m̵̥̂͛̄̀͑e̸̟̝͙̱̹͒͗̓͆̂!̴̯̹̆"̶͓̇ͅͅ

"Mama?!" 妈妈?!

"Ms Soryu?!" 是 Soryu 小姐吗?!

Mama -was it really her now?- hissed softly, giving Asuka a smile that was probably supposed to be friendly. She opened her mouth and said, in a voice like static, "̶D̶e̶a̶r̷,̶ ̶s̴w̵e̷e̶t̸ ̴A̸s̴u̸k̸a̵,̸ ̴m̷y̴ ̴d̷a̵r̷l̸i̸n̶g̵ ̸g̶i̶r̴l̴.̷ ̷W̴o̸n̴'̷t̷ ̸y̷o̴u̵ ̵d̷o̵ ̴y̷o̵u̸r̷ ̵m̸o̴t̶h̸e̷r̶ ̷a̵ ̴f̵a̸v̵o̴u̵r̷ ̵a̴n̵d̶ ̷d̶i̶e̶ ̵w̷i̵t̶h̴ ̷m̸e̴?̸"̶
妈妈——真的是她吗？——轻声嘶嘶地说着，对明日香露出了一个可能是友好的微笑。她张开嘴，用一种像静电般的声音说道：“亲爱的，可爱的明日香，我的宝贝女儿。你不愿意为你母亲做件好事，与我共赴黄泉吗？”

"W-what?!" Asuka yelped, backing away from... whatever her mother had suddenly turned into. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Shinji carefully edge towards and in front of her, turning his body so that his left side was facing Mama and the younger version of herself was shielded. "Die? What are you saying?!"
什么？！"明日香惊叫着后退，面对母亲突然变成的未知形态感到恐惧。她用眼角余光瞥见，真嗣正小心翼翼地向她靠近，并站在她前面，用身体左侧对着母亲，同时保护着年幼的自己。"死？你在说什么啊？！

Mama slowly advanced on the two of them, but her yellow eyes were now completely focused on Asuka. "̶D̸o̸n̴'̶t̴ ̴y̴o̵u̶ ̴w̷a̵n̶t̴ ̷t̷o̷ ̴b̸e̶ ̶w̸i̷t̵h̷ ̴m̵e̶ ̷f̷o̸r̶e̴v̷e̴r̵,̴ ̴d̶e̸a̴r̵-̵d̸e̸a̵r̵-̶d̴e̸a̷r̵-̷d̸e̶a̶r̷-̵"̸
妈妈慢慢逼近他们两人，黄眼睛紧紧盯着明日香。"难道你不想永远和我在一起吗，亲爱的-亲爱的-亲爱的-"

Her head jerked backwards like somebody had just punched her, and for a split second Asuka thought that Shinji had been the one to do it. But then Mama grabbed her head with both hands and shouted in agony, dropping to one knee. Asuka remained where she was, still struggling to understand what was going on.
她的头突然向后一仰，好像被人猛击了一样，那一刻，明日香以为是真嗣所为。然而，妈妈随即双手抱头，痛苦地尖叫着跪倒在地。明日香依旧站在那里，还在试图弄清楚究竟发生了什么。

Shinji glanced back at her, panicked confusion on his face, and all Asuka could do was shrug in response.
真嗣慌张地回头看向她，脸上写满了困惑，明日香对此只能无奈地耸肩回应。

"A... Asuka..." 啊... 飞鸟...

This voice was not static; it was her voice once more. "...Mama? Is that you?"
这声音并非杂音，而是她的声音再次传来。“...妈妈？是您吗？”

"Y-yes," Mama groaned, one hand fumbling for purchase on the bed while the other rubbed at her eyes. "I... that was..." The hand on her face fell away, and her eyes slowly opened.
"是的，"妈妈呻吟着，一只手在床上摸索着支撑，另一只手揉着惺忪的睡眼。"我...刚才那是..."她脸上的手垂下，双眼缓缓睁开。

About to run up and check on her, Asuka quickly stopped in her tracks. Mama's left eye was blue like it should have been, but the other was rapidly flickering between blue and the ugly yellow it had been a moment ago.
明日香正要跑过去查看，却突然止步。妈妈的左眼是正常的蓝色，但右眼却在蓝色与刚才那丑陋的黄色之间快速闪烁。

"I'm... sorry to scare you like that," said Mama, finally levering herself unsteadily to her feet. "But at least now... now I know what's going on here." She turned around to stare at the copy of herself on the bed. "So. I didn't quite die in Unit-02. At least, not fully."
我...很抱歉刚才吓着你了，"妈妈终于颤巍巍地站起身来，说道。"但至少现在...现在我明白了这里的情况。"她转过身，凝视着床上的另一个自己。"看来。我在二号机里并未完全丧命。至少，没有彻底消逝。

"Are you alright, ma'am?" Shinji asked, his stance still wary. "You scared us quite a bit there."
女士，您没事吧？" 真嗣关切地询问，身体依旧保持着戒备。"刚才您可真把我们吓了一跳。

Out of pure reflex, Asuka took a step back when Mama rounded on them. Her right eye was still flickering, but the blue seemed to be slowly winning. And... was there a slight echo in Mama's voice now? "Asuka, my darling... I am so sorry for what I- what part of me did to you."
完全是本能反应，妈妈突然转身时，明日香不由自主地退后一步。她的右眼依旧闪烁不定，但蓝色光芒似乎正慢慢占据优势。还有...妈妈的嗓音里是不是多了一丝回响？“明日香，我的宝贝...我为那个我——或者说我的一部分对你所做的事深感歉意。”

Asuka cautiously took a few steps forward. "W... what do you mean? And what just happened?"
明日香谨慎地向前迈了几步，问道：“你这话是什么意思？刚才到底怎么了？”

"First things first." Mama squeezed her eyes shut again, but a second later they were open once more. The yellow was completely gone from her right eye, but that did not do much to comfort Asuka, especially since that echo still seemed to be in her voice. "Okay. So... I appear to have two separate sets of memories crawling around in my head. This memory of yours, Asuka, seemed to trigger that second set and force it to the surface."
首先，最重要的事情。"妈妈再次闭上眼睛，但很快又睁开了。她右眼中的黄色已完全消失，但这并未让飞鸟感到安心，尤其是她声音中的那种回响依旧存在。"好吧。看来... 我脑海中似乎有两套不同的记忆在徘徊。飞鸟，你的这段记忆似乎触发了第二套记忆，使其浮现出来。

"Second set," Shinji echoed, glancing between Mama and the woman on the bed. His eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Do you mean you just remembered... everything that happened in this hospital?"
‘第二组，’真嗣重复着，目光在母亲和床上的女子间游移，眼中闪过一丝疑虑。‘你是说，你刚刚才记起这家医院里发生的所有事情？’

Mama nodded sadly, and waved a hand at the bed. "Yes. Some part of my mind continued on in my body when I-" she gestured at herself, "-was taken into Unit-02. And in those memories..."
妈妈悲伤地点头，向床挥了挥手。“没错。我被吸入二号机时，一部分意识仍留在体内。那些记忆里……”

She paused, looking back at the bed for a moment before striding over to it and ripping the doll out of the memory-woman's hands. She held it in front of her, disappointment on her face. "I... believed that this doll really was Asuka. Those memories aren't of a doll, they are of... well..."
她顿了顿，回头望向床铺，随即快步上前，从那记忆中的女子手中夺过玩偶。她将玩偶举至眼前，脸上满是失望。“我……曾以为这玩偶就是明日香。那些记忆并非属于玩偶，而是属于……唉……”

Shinji looked down at the frozen girl in his arms. "You could literally only see the real Asuka, while everyone else saw a doll."
真嗣低头凝视着怀中冻僵的少女。"唯有你，才能看见真正的明日香，其他人眼中的她，不过是个没有灵魂的玩偶。"

"That..." Asuka began, her words catching in her throat. "...That was why you... she... thought I was a stranger?"
那...” 明日香艰难地开口，声音有些哽咽。“...那就是你...她...觉得我是陌生人的原因吗？

"Precisely, darling." Mama tossed the doll back on the bed and quickly moved to stand in front of Asuka, Shinji quick to get out of the way. "You were somebody trying to tell me my daughter was fake. But I could see Asuka right in front of me. What else could I do but ignore that apparently crazy person?" She wrapped her arms around Asuka, strangely mindful of the child she was holding, enveloping her in the first real hug Asuka had received from her mother in a decade.
"没错，亲爱的。"妈妈将娃娃抛回床上，快步走到明日香面前，真嗣也迅速闪开。"你曾有人试图告诉我，我的女儿是假的。但我亲眼看到明日香就在眼前。除了不理会那个显然疯了的人，我还能怎么办？"她紧紧抱住明日香，小心翼翼地拥抱着这个孩子，给予了她十年来母亲第一个真切的拥抱。

Well. For a given value of 'real'.
好吧，如果对“真实”有一个特定的界定。

"Asuka, please forgive me," Mama begged, the corners of her eyes beginning to brim with tears. "Right when you needed me most, I turned away from you. I ended up traumatising you."
Asuka，请原谅我，"妈妈恳求着，眼角泪光闪烁。"在你最需要我的时候，我却离你而去。我最终让你受到了创伤。

"M-Mama..." 妈妈...

Around them, almost going unnoticed, the hospital room began to fade back into blackness. Asuka got one hand free to return the hug. "Please... Mama," she replied, trying to hold back her own tears. "You truly believed you were looking after me. I... can't really fault you for that."
在他们周围，病房几乎悄然无声地重新融入黑暗。明日香腾出一只手，回以拥抱。“求你了，妈妈，”她哽咽着说，努力不让泪水流下。“你真心以为在照顾我。我...真的无法因此责怪你。”

"Um..." 呃...

Shinji's voice drew the attention of mother and daughter; he flinched slightly under their attention. "Sorry," he said, glancing away for a moment at where the hospital bed had been. "But something doesn't make sense now. I don't mean the whole two minds thing, it's just..." He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before opening them again. His expression was unreadable.
真嗣的声音引起了母女俩的注意，他略显局促地承受着她们的目光。“对不起，”他边说边瞥了一眼原本放着医院病床的位置。“只是现在有些事情解释不通。我指的不是两个意识的问题，而是……”他闭目深呼吸后重新睁开眼睛，脸上的表情让人难以揣摩。

"Why did you commit suicide, Ms Soryu?"
索玉女士，您为何选择自杀？

Asuka, staring at Shinji, felt her mother slowly let go of her, and she let her own arm return to her side.
明日香注视着真嗣，察觉到母亲渐渐松开了手，她便自然地将手臂垂至身旁。

"I-I mean," Shinji stammered, now looking like he was getting ready to run. "If you thought you were still looking after Asuka, why would you kill yourself?
"我...我是说，" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，此刻他看起来像是要随时逃跑。"既然你觉得自己还在照看明日香，又怎么会想到要自杀呢？

"I... I'm sorry," said Mama. "But... I don't really know. My memories of that time slowly get more and more... fragmented. Lesser. All I can clearly remember is Asuka; nothing about what's happening... around her, so to speak."
我...我很抱歉，"妈妈说道，"可是...我真的不清楚。那段时光的记忆正逐渐变得...零碎，愈发模糊。我唯一能清晰记起的只有明日香；至于她身边发生的事，几乎无从谈起。

Shinji seemed like he was about to respond, but his mouth remained closed. Perhaps he thought he'd tried to dig enough into their past.
真嗣好像要开口回应，但最终还是闭口不言。可能他觉得自己已经过多地触及了他们的往事。

"Wait," Mama suddenly said, holding a hand to her head. Her right eye began to flicker yellow again, causing a wave of worry to wash over Asuka. "I think I remember... something..."
等等，"妈妈突然开口，一手扶额。她的右眼再次闪烁起黄光，让明日香心头涌起一阵不安。"我好像记起了...一些事情...

"Don't try and force yourself to remember," warned Shinji. "I... learned that the hard way," he added with an embarrassed glance at Asuka.
"别勉强自己去记，" 真嗣提醒道。"我... 是吃了苦头才明白的，" 他带着一丝尴尬看向明日香。

"No no, it's... almost..." Mama tilted her head from side to side as if trying to physically dislodge the memory. "Asuka's there... or the doll... I'm standing up... no, standing on something. There's something around my neck... and I'm putting something around As- the doll's neck. Oh no..." She paled considerably, her eyes nervously darting to Asuka, the right flickering yellow more and more. "No. I wouldn't... I couldn't..."
不不，这是...几乎..."妈妈左右摇晃着头，仿佛试图从身体上摆脱这段记忆。"明日香在那里...或者那个玩偶...我站着...不，站在某物上。有什么东西绕在我的脖子上...而我正在把什么东西绕在明-那个玩偶的脖子上。哦不..."她的脸色变得相当苍白，眼睛紧张地瞥向明日香，右眼闪烁的黄色越来越频繁。"不。我不会...我不能...

"Mama, please!" Asuka urgently exclaimed. "You-... she-... you weren't mentally stable!"
妈妈，求您了！" 阿苏卡急切地喊道，"你...她...你那时精神状态并不稳定！

"Ms Soryu!" Shinji added his own voice. "You don't have to keep going!"
绫波小姐！" 真嗣也喊道，"你不需要再坚持了！

"I..." Mama blinked several times, the flickering of her right eye fading. "No... you're right... the mind itself isn't easily explainable. It could have been anything."
我……"妈妈眨了眨眼，右眼的颤动渐渐平息。"不……你说得对……心灵本身就难以言喻。可能是任何事物。

"And you shouldn't be trying to relive your own death!" said Asuka.
"你可不该试图重温自己的死亡！"阿苏卡说道。

Mama closed her eyes, letting out a long breath. "Yes, and besides, I-"
妈妈闭上眼，长出一口气。“对，而且，我……”

When the pause started to get concerning, Asuka hesitantly called out, "...Mama?"
停顿渐长，Asuka 犹豫着轻声唤道：“...妈妈？”

Mama's right eye slammed open, glowing completely yellow once more. Asuka jumped backwards, half-noticing Shinji shift into the same left-facing stance as before.
母亲右眼突然睁大，再次完全泛起黄色光芒。明日香向后一跃，半意识到真嗣又摆出了之前面向左的姿势。

"̵̷̵I̵̵̷ ̵̷̸w̸i̸l̴l̷ ̷k̷e̴e̷p̸ ̴̵̶y̶̸̵o̷̵̷u̷̶̵ ̴s̴a̶f̷e̶,̵̴" the woman intoned, her voice again static, but she was unmoving, staring at nothing. "̷T̴h̵e̷y̸ ̵w̴a̵n̵t̴ ̵t̴o̴ ̸t̷a̷k̶e̶ ̸y̴o̸u̶ ̷f̴r̵o̴m̶ ̴m̸e̴.̶ ̸B̶u̴t̸ ̴w̴e̸ ̷w̵i̷l̸l̶ ̵b̸e̴ ̶t̴o̴g̸e̷t̸h̵e̷r̶ ̷f̶o̷r̵e̷v̷e̴r̵,̵ ̶m̸y̷ ̵d̷a̸r̷l̵i̶n̸g̶.̸ ̶J̷u̶s̵t̶ ̷c̸o̵m̷e̶ ̸h̴e̸r̴e̴,̷ ̸l̵e̴t̵ ̶m̴e̷ ̷h̴e̸l̶p̶ ̸y̶o̵u̵.̶"̸
我会确保你的安全，"女人语气中带着静电，她静止不动，目光空洞。"他们企图将你从我身边带走。但我们终将永远相伴，亲爱的。只需靠近我，让我来帮你。

Her left eye opened. It was still blue. Her voice, while no longer static, still sounded... strange. "I shouldn't be doing this, but I can't get myself to stop moving. The noose is already there, but I don't remember making one. Why do I know how to make one? I'm trying to stop myself from standing on the chair, but-"
她的左眼缓缓睁开，依旧是那抹蓝色。她的声音已无杂音，却透着一种异样。“我本不该如此，却无法控制自己停下。绳索已悬在那儿，我却不记得何时挂上的。为何我懂得如何结绳？我极力阻止自己踏上椅子，然而——”

"̶A̷s̸u̵k̵a̷ ̵̵̷i̶s̷ ̴̵̸b̴e̵i̷n̶g̸ ̶̶̸s̵a̸v̸e̵d̵.̵ ̴S̷h̷e̵ ̶s̴t̴a̷r̷e̴s̴ ̶a̴t̴ ̵m̶e̴ ̴a̵s̸ ̷I̷ ̸p̵r̷e̴p̶a̸r̶e̴ ̸m̸y̶s̷e̷l̸f̴.̸ ̶I̴ ̵t̴r̷y̸ ̶t̶o̵ ̶m̶o̵v̸e̸ ̵m̴y̶ ̴f̴o̶o̷t̸ ̷t̴o̶ ̸p̴u̶s̴h̸ ̸t̶h̷e̵ ̸c̴h̴a̴i̴r̷ ̸o̵u̷t̶ ̵o̵f̷ ̵t̸h̴e̶ ̷w̷a̷y̷.̴.̸.̴ ̷b̷u̸t̶ ̸s̸o̵m̵e̵t̵h̷i̴n̷g̷ ̵i̷s̴ ̷s̵t̴o̶p̵p̶i̷n̴g̴ ̴i̷t̵.̸ ̵I̶ ̶c̸a̵n̸n̸o̶t̷ ̵m̷o̷v̶e̸ ̶m̷y̶ ̷l̵e̶g̷s̵.̶"̴
明日香正在获救。她凝视着我，我则准备采取行动。我尝试挪动脚部，将椅子推开，但似乎有什么阻碍了这一动作。我的双腿动弹不得。

"I almost faint with relief. I've managed to stop myself. But Asuka isn't moving. I reach out to her, trying to get her out of the noose, but it's too tight. I can't fit her head through it. I try and try and-"
我几乎因解脱感而晕倒。我勉强控制住自己。然而，明日香一动不动。我伸手去救她，试图解开她脖子上的绳套，但它太紧了。我怎么也套不出她的头。我一次又一次地尝试——

Mama's entire body suddenly jerked. "The chair! I didn't move my legs but the chair just suddenly moved! I kick my feet around, trying to find it, or reach something so I can get out of the noose, but-"
妈妈全身猛地一颤。“那把椅子！我明明没动腿，椅子却突然挪动了！我拼命踢腿，想找到它，或触碰到什么，以便挣脱这绞索，可是——”

"̶S̸o̶m̸e̷t̸h̷i̵n̶g̸ ̶i̸s̴ ̸h̸o̶l̷d̸i̷n̶g̵ ̸m̷y̵ ̸l̶e̵g̴s̷.̵"̸
有什么东西正抓着我的腿。

Shinji and Asuka stared at each other, an iceberg forming in her stomach and horror written all over his face.
真嗣与明日香四目相对，她感到胃中冰冷如冰山，而他脸上则满是惊恐之色。

Did... did somebody make Mama commit suicide?!
难道...是有人逼迫妈妈自杀的吗？！

Mama groaned heavily, both hands holding her head again. With a gasp, her eyes closed and opened, and the yellow was gone. "Oh," she muttered once she could speak again. "God. Fucking. Damnit."
母亲沉重地呻吟，双手再次紧抱头部。她深吸一口气，双眼一闭一睁，那黄色已然不见。“哦，”她能再次开口时低声咒骂，“天哪，真他妈的。”

The ground rumbled again; Asuka understood the feeling completely. She wanted to find out who had taken advantage of her mother and then crush them slowly in Unit-02's fist.
地面再次震动，明日香深有同感。她决心找出利用她母亲的人，然后用二号机的铁拳慢慢将其粉碎。

A hand landed on her shoulder, and Asuka almost turned her rage on the perpetrator. She stopped herself just in time from sending a fist directly into Shinji's face. Shinji, to his credit, hardly even flinched at her expression. "Asuka," he said. His voice was low, but Asuka could sense the barely concealed hatred in it. "Store that anger for later. For now, just hug your mother."
一只手搭在她的肩上，明日香差点将怒火发泄到那人身上。她及时克制住自己，才没一拳打在真嗣脸上。真嗣面对她的怒容几乎不为所动，值得称赞。“明日香，”他低声说，尽管声音平静，明日香却能感受到他压抑的恨意。“把怒气留到以后再用，现在，去抱抱你妈妈吧。”

With a jolt, Asuka realised that Mama was now somewhat folding in on herself, sinking down to the ground and wrapping her arms around her legs. She took a breath, doing as Shinji suggested and locking the anger away so it could be used later. She then handed him his own younger-
突然，明日香察觉到妈妈开始蜷缩身体，缓缓蹲下，双臂环抱住自己的双腿。她深吸一口气，遵照真嗣的提议，将怒火暂时压抑，留待将来释放。接着，她递给了他自己的年幼-

The child had vanished. 孩子不见了。

Asuka blinked, staring at her empty hands and then around the void surrounding them, and Shinji mirrored her upon realising that the younger girl had also disappeared. Once more, puzzled looks were exchanged, but Asuka swiftly put that aside. There was no point in focusing on something like that when a very real person needed her.
明日香眨了眨眼，看着自己空无一物的双手，再环顾四周的虚空，发现那个更年轻的女孩也不见了，真嗣见状也跟着她四处张望。两人再次面面相觑，满是困惑，但明日香很快将这疑惑搁置一旁。毕竟，当有人真正需要她时，纠结于这些细节并无意义。

Kneeling down next to Mama, Asuka gently forced her arms apart so that she could slip in between them. She glanced back at Shinji, and for some unknown reason she gestured with a quick tilt of her head for him to join them. Shinji, in response, paled and held up both hands, but after a moment's thought he came over to sit next to them. Asuka, half-searching her mind for why she had tried to include him in the hug,accepted his show of support with a weak smile.
跪在母亲身旁，明日香轻柔地分开她的双臂，让自己能挤进去。她回头望向真嗣，不知何故，她快速地偏了偏头，示意他过来。真嗣见状脸色一白，举起双手，但犹豫片刻后，还是坐到了他们身边。明日香心中半是疑惑为何要拉他一起，却也接受了他的支持，勉强挤出一丝微笑。

The ground rumbled yet again, but there was something different about it this time. Mama looked upwards. "Somebody is accessing the entry plug manual release system," she dully said. "...I guess our time here is about to come to an end."
地面又一次震动，这次却透着异样。妈妈抬头望天，语气平淡：“有人在启动插入栓的手动释放系统。”她稍作停顿，“看来我们在此地的时光即将告终。”

Asuka cursed, almost wishing the ground could shake for her as well. But then Shinji surprised her with what he said next. "Good." At her narrowed eyes, he hurriedly added, "I mean, after everything we've just been through, I think we need some time to... work through it all."
明日香咒骂着，几乎希望地面也能为她震动。然而，真嗣接下来的话让她吃了一惊。“挺好的。”见她目光锐利，他赶紧解释，“我是说，经历了这么多，我们确实需要点时间来……消化这一切。”

Asuka held the stare for a moment longer, before conceding the point with a nod. "Yeah, I suppose you're right." She glanced at Mama. "But... what about you? Will you be alright?"
明日香又凝视了片刻，最终点头表示认同：“嗯，你说的没错。”她转头看向妈妈，“那你呢？你还好吗？”

"Don't worry about me, darling," Mama replied. "I've been mostly alone with my thoughts for a decade. These new ones are just going to be... stranger to deal with. But I'll manage."
亲爱的，别为我担心，"妈妈回答说，"我独自思考已久，已有十年。这些新想法虽显陌生，但我能处理好。

With a massive amount of reluctance, Asuka let go of her mother and stood up. Shinji got to his feet as well, standing next to her.
明日香极不情愿地松开了母亲的手，站起身来。真嗣也随之起身，站在她身旁。

"Ms Soryu," he said, bowing to Mama. "Thank you very much for doing all you could to protect us from the Angel."
绫波小姐，" 他向母亲鞠躬致谢，"非常感谢您竭尽全力保护我们免受使徒的威胁。

Mama snorted bemusedly as she got to her feet. "I wouldn't be much of an Evangelion if I didn't protect my pilots. Now go. Get out of here you two."
妈妈起身时，带着几分好笑地哼了一声。“如果我不保护我的驾驶员，那我就不配称为福音战士了。你们俩快走吧。”

Asuka slowly turned away, trying to keep Mama in her sight for as long as possible, before walking away into the nothingness. After a moment she realised Shinji was nowhere to be seen and she sighed.
明日香缓缓转过身，努力让妈妈留在视野里，随后步入了虚无之中。片刻后，她察觉到真嗣已不见踪影，不由得叹了口气。

Evangelions were so, so goddamn confusing.
新世纪福音战士真是让人一头雾水。

XXX

"Shinji, a moment please?"
真嗣，稍等一下可以吗？

"Huh?" 嗯？

Shinji turned around to face Ms Soryu, and then turned around again when he realised Asuka had vanished. The woman waved a hand. "Don't worry, I just want to talk to you in private for a moment."
真嗣转身面向索留香女士，发现明日香不见后再次转身。那位女士挥手示意。“别担心，我只是想私下和你聊几句。”

Uneasiness began to gnaw away at the inside of Shinji's stomach. "Um... what about, ma'am?"
不安感开始在真嗣的胃中蔓延。“那个... 您怎么看，女士？”

"I think you know." 我想你应该知道。

The unease ripped a chunk out of his torso and began chewing contentedly. "A...about Asuka?"
不安撕扯下他胸前的一块肉，开始心满意足地咀嚼。“那个……关于明日香的事？”

"Yes." Almost all traces of what they had just witnessed were seemingly gone, but there was still some haggardness on Ms Soryu's face as she stared at him. "I've seen enough from both of you to know that something big is going on between the two of you." She raised a hand to forestall any interruption. "And I just want you to know... that I approve."
是的。"刚才所见的一切痕迹几乎都已消散，但索琉小姐的脸上仍残留着疲惫，她凝视着他。"从你们俩的举动中，我已察觉到你们之间定有重大之事。"她举手示意无需插话。"我只想表明……我支持你们。

His eyes widened in surprise. "You... um... you mean..."
他惊讶地睁大了眼睛。“你...是说...”

"If you are serious about seeking a romantic relationship with my daughter, then you may proceed. And since I know you aren't the type to just be wanting to get into her panties, I don't need to give you the whole 'I am an Evangelion and I can make you suffer' speech to try and scare you." Ms Soryu grinned slightly as Shinji paled.
"如果你真心追求与我女儿的浪漫关系，那么你可以继续。我知道你并非那种只图一时之快的人，因此无需用'我乃使徒，能让你痛不欲生'的言辞来恐吓你。" 索里乌女士嘴角微扬，而真嗣面色顿显苍白。

"Y-yes, ma'am," he stammered. "I will not do anything that would hurt Asuka."
是的，女士，"他结结巴巴地说，"我绝不会做出伤害明日香的事。

"I know," Ms Soryu repeated. "But I want you to promise me something else, Something much more important."
我明白，" 索琉再次强调，"不过，我希望你能答应我另一件更重要的事。

Shinji nodded. "Anything for her."
真嗣点头说：“为了她，我什么都愿意做。”

"Anything?" Ms Soryu raised an eyebrow. "How serious about 'anything' are you?"
有什么事吗？" 索留香挑了挑眉。"你说的'任何事'有多认真？

Taking a deep breath, Shinji stood as straight as he could. "Ms Soryu, I would sooner die than let any harm come to your daughter."
深吸一口气，真嗣挺直了身子。“索尔尤小姐，我宁死也不愿您的女儿受到一丝伤害。”

The other eyebrow raised. "Now that... is a big promise. A lot can happen in fights involving Evangelions. You would jump in front of an Angel to save her without hesitation?"
另一侧的眉毛一挑，说道："这可是个不小的承诺。与初号机相关的战斗变数颇多。你真会毫不犹豫地挡在使徒面前，只为救她？"

"I probably wouldn't even have time to think about hesitating," replied Shinji. "If she's in danger, I will protect her."
我恐怕连犹豫的功夫都没有，" 真嗣答道，"她若遇险，我定会挺身而出。

"You are... surprisingly noble, Shinji Ikari," Ms Soryu remarked. "But here's what I want you to promise me." She leaned in close enough that their foreheads were almost touching. "I want you to end anything that harms my daughter."
你真是...出乎意料地高尚，碇真嗣，" 惣流女士说道。"但我要你向我承诺一件事。" 她倾身靠近，两人的额头几乎相触。"我要你终结任何伤害我女儿的事物。

Shinji blinked slowly, unable to speak as the scary woman who could make the ground shake stood upright. "Of course, that means having to beat me to the punch, but I'm just trying to ensure her safety no matter what happens."
真嗣缓缓眨眼，哑口无言，眼前这位能让大地颤抖的可怕女子正挺立着。“当然，这意味着我必须先下手为强，但我这么做只是为了确保她的安全，无论发生什么。”

"Like I said, Ms Soryu." Shinji clenched his right fist. "Anything for her."
正如我之前所说，索留香小姐。" 碇真嗣紧握右拳，坚定地说，"为了她，我愿意做任何事。

"That's my boy," Ms Soryu said, causing him to blush. "Now get on out of here. Oh, and tell Yui I said hello."
那是我儿子，"索琉女士说道，令他脸颊泛红。"快去吧。对了，替我向唯问好。

Shinji opened his mouth to say goodbye, but he suddenly found himself floating in midair, drifting away from Asuka's mother. Some unseen force was turning his body around, pushing him into a sort of supine position. Belatedly, he realised he could feel something on his back, and when he tried to reach to feel what it was he saw his hand clad in a familiar blue and white material.
真嗣本想开口道别，却猛然发现自己悬浮在空中，正逐渐远离明日香的母亲。一股看不见的力量正扭转他的身体，让他仰面躺着。他这才迟钝地察觉到背上有异物，伸手欲探究竟时，只见自己的手被那熟悉的蓝白材质所覆盖。

He blinked, and suddenly the blackness was replaced with the interior of an entry plug, lit dull red by emergency lighting. Behind him, he could hear Asuka sitting up and he did the same. They faced each other, unreadable expressions on both their faces.
他眨了眨眼，黑暗瞬间被一个插入栓的内部所替代，紧急照明发出暗淡的红光。身后传来明日香坐起的声音，他也随之坐直。两人面对面，脸上的表情难以解读。

Without a word spoken, they both got out of their seats and stood as best as they could in the entry plug, so close their foreheads were almost touching. Hesitantly, they reached out their arms, shying away slightly as they almost made contact. Their expressions changed, eyes slowly starting to brim with tears as each vividly remembered what the other had suffered through and how similar it was to their own life, and some courage was found. Blue-clad arms met at the back of the girl's plugsuit, and red-clad arms desperately clung to the boy.
没有言语，两人默默起身，在插入栓入口处尽可能地靠近站立，额头几乎相触。他们迟疑地伸出双臂，在即将接触时又略显羞涩地退缩。表情逐渐变化，眼眶中泪水渐盈，各自清晰地回忆起对方所承受的苦难，与自身经历何其相似，勇气随之而生。穿着蓝色衣袖的手臂轻触女孩的插入服，而穿着红色衣袖的手臂则紧紧抱住男孩。

The entry plug hatch opened, but neither of them were awake to notice it; fatigue had already claimed them. Despite the efforts of several medics, they could not be pried apart without risking injury, and ended up being placed on a single gurney to be returned to NERV.
入口插头舱门开启，然而两人都未曾醒来察觉；疲惫已将他们彻底征服。尽管医护人员多次尝试，但为了避免造成伤害，他们未能被分开，最终只得共用一张担架送回 NERV。

Not a single person commented on it as the pilots were extracted and sent off to the Geofront. The two of them had been through hell numerous times before, and by all accounts this attack had been far worse. If two scarred teenagers found some semblance of solace in each other's arms, that was none of their business.
无人对此发表评论，飞行员被救出并送往 Geofront。这对年轻人已多次历经磨难，而此次袭击显然更为惨烈。若两位伤痕累累的少年能在彼此怀抱中寻得片刻安宁，那也与旁人无关。

### Chapter 41 I Know What Happened

Misato tiredly rubbed her face with both hands. On the other side of the desk, Ritsuko typed away at her computer, smoking a cigarette like it had offended her. Her key presses were not at their usual speed; having to deal with a dozen things at once thanks to this latest Angel attack had drained her energy to the point where she kept having to delete and retype misspelled words and commands.
三笠疲惫地用双手揉搓着脸庞。桌子另一端，律子正埋头于电脑前，手指在键盘上敲击，同时抽着烟，仿佛烟触怒了她一般。由于这次最新使徒的袭击，她不得不同时应对众多事务，这让她精疲力尽，以至于频繁地删除并重输那些拼写错误和指令。

"Wanna take any bets on what weirdness they'll be suffering from this time?" Misato asked after ten minutes of typing.
"要不要赌一下这次他们会碰到什么怪事？" Misato 敲击键盘十分钟后问道。

"Hmm?" Ritsuko looked up from her computer, her eyes haggard and slightly unfocused. "What was that?"
嗯？" 律子从电脑屏幕前抬起头，双眼显得疲惫且有些失焦。"你刚说什么？

"Asuka and Shinji," Misato clarified. "After what they just went through, you know there's going to be some strange synchronisation thing happening again."
是 Asuka 和 Shinji，"Misato 明确指出。"刚经历的那一切，你清楚他们之间必然会再次出现那种奇异的同步效应。

Ritsuko blinked slowly, before Misato's words finally sank in. "Oh," she belatedly said. "Well, after we gave them both a muscle relaxant so we could separate them, we put them into two rearranged rooms so they don't match. For now we can only hope that'll be enough to break them out of any synchronisation they might be stuck in."
律子缓缓眨了眨眼，这才反应过来美里的话。"哦，"她稍显迟疑地说，"我们给他们俩都打了肌肉松弛剂，好把他们分开，然后把他们安置在重新布置过的两个房间里，这样就不会匹配了。眼下我们只能寄希望于这能打破他们可能陷入的任何同步状态。"

"And that was a hell of a sight," remarked Misato. "They seemed a bit awkward around another recently and suddenly they're hugging like-"
那真是令人惊叹的一幕，" 三佐感叹道。"他们最近相处还有些生疏，突然间却紧紧相拥，仿佛-

"Like you and Kaji having a week off." Ritsuko accompanied the interruption with a knowing look. "Look, until they wake up it's impossible to know what they experienced while the Angel was messing with their heads. And you can bet that has the Committee all stirred up; that the Angel might have been trying to communicate with them."
就像你和 Kaji 休假一周那样。" 律子带着一副心知肚明的表情插话，"听着，在他们醒来之前，我们无从得知天使干扰他们思维时他们经历了什么。而且可以肯定，委员会对此已经非常紧张，担心天使可能试图与他们沟通。

Misato looked worried. "...Do you think it did?"
美里显得忧心忡忡。"...你认为它成功了吗？"

"Impossible to know," Ritsuko repeated, bringing up a hand to rub at her eyes with a thumb and forefinger "But something happened, and the Committee is going to want to talk to them as soon as they're awake.
"难以预知，" 律子再次说道，抬起手用拇指和食指轻揉眼角，"但确实出了事，委员会希望他们一醒就进行谈话。

Misato opened her mouth, but then paused, eyeing up her friend. "...How long have you been awake for?" she asked. "You look about ready to collapse."
“Misato 本欲开口，却突然停下，目光审视着她的朋友。“你醒了多久了？”她关切地问。“看样子你快撑不住了。”

"I don't know," Ritsuko replied, turning back to her computer. "Are we finished with all the after-action reports yet?"
我不清楚，" 丽萨说着，转回电脑前。"所有的行动后报告都完成了吗？

"...No?" ...不对吗？

"Then I haven't been awake long enough." One of Ritsuko's hands grasped for the cup of coffee on her desk. Only Misato's reflexes, not that much better than Ritsuko's, managed to stop it from spilling as she absently knocked it over.
"看来我还没清醒多久。" 丽的手本能地伸向桌上的咖啡杯，幸亏美里的反应稍快，及时在不经意间碰倒杯子时阻止了咖啡洒出。

"Coffee may be a great drink, especially the rocket fuel your machine puts out, but even it has limits." Misato worked to gently pry the cup out of her friend's hands. "Look, just take a nap for an hour or so. You're making mistakes; you don't want to end up sending off a bad report do you?"
咖啡虽好，尤其是你那台机器煮出的浓烈咖啡，但终究有其极限。" 米萨托轻柔地从朋友手中取走杯子，劝说道："听我的，睡上一小时。你现在失误连连，总不希望交出一份糟糕的报告吧？

Ritsuko's eyes darted between her computer screen and her office door, the fingers of one hand tapping on the edge of the keyboard. Finally, she sighed. "Fine, I'll take a break."
律子的目光在电脑屏幕与办公室门之间游移，一只手的手指不自觉地轻敲键盘边缘。最后，她轻叹一声：“算了，我休息会儿。”

The remains of her coffee were just enough to get her to the bunkroom.
她杯中剩余的咖啡，勉强够她撑到回宿舍。

XXX

He opened his eyes, staring up at the depressingly familiar ceiling. Yet again an Angel attack had managed to land them in the medical wing, but at least this time there were no injuries. None that could be seen at least.
他睁开双眼，凝望着那再熟悉不过的压抑天花板。又一次，天使的袭击将他们送到了医疗区，所幸这次至少表面上没有受伤。

But at least she was alright, all things considered.
但综合来看，她至少安然无恙。

She groaned, feeling the ache in her skull from the Angel's attack. Running a hand through her hair turned the groan into a grumble. Whoever had delivered them to the medical wing had done little about the LCL in her hair, and it was now a mess of tangles that would take forever to fix.
她呻吟着，头骨因天使的攻击而隐隐作痛。伸手梳理头发时，呻吟转为咕哝。送她到医疗区的人并未清理她头发中的 LCL，如今头发纠结成团，梳理起来费时费力。

But at least he was alright, all things considered.
但综合考虑，他至少还算安好。

He went back over what he had inadvertently learned of her past, grimly noting the similarities to his own life. Both lives had been horrible, but thankfully she hadn't been forced to watch her mother disintegrating.
他重新审视了无意间得知的她的过往，阴郁地察觉到这些与他自己的人生轨迹惊人地相似。两人的生活都充满了苦难，但值得庆幸的是，她未曾被迫目睹母亲生命的凋零。

She recalled the traumatic events that had happened in his past, and how it had left him in a state disgustingly familiar to her own. Both lives had been horrible, but thankfully he hadn't walked in on his mother dangling from the ceiling.
她回想起他过往的创伤经历，以及这些经历如何使他陷入一种令她深感共鸣的痛苦状态。两人的生活都颇为不幸，但庆幸的是，他并未亲眼见到母亲自缢的惨状。

The problem now was... who else could they turn to but each other? Something was suspicious with NERV; their mothers were trapped in the Evangelions, without any word to the pilots, and if Mama's memory was accurate somebody had interfered, ensuring she had supposedly committed suicide.
眼下难题在于……除了相互依靠，他们还能求助于谁？NERV 的行径令人起疑；他们的母亲被困于福音战士内，未向驾驶员透露半点风声，若母亲的记忆无误，显然有人从中作梗，让她被误以为是自杀。

Hands clenched into tight fists. Somebody was going to pay for that. Nothing could be done for the moment though, since there was no clue where to start looking, and nobody to turn to for help. Even Misato wouldn't be of much assistance; despite being the head of Tactical Operations she likely wouldn't have access to those sorts of secrets.
双手紧握成拳，有人必将为此付出代价。然而眼下却束手无策，既无从寻觅线索，也无人可求助。即便是战术行动部的头儿三佐，恐怕也爱莫能助；尽管她身居要职，这类机密她或许同样触及不到。

...No. Wait. There was one person. Mister Kaji was... detached enough from NERV to be trusted, but at the same time he seemed like the sort to be able to find certain things out. Unfortunately, when they had last spoken he had said he would be gone for a while. It would just have to wait until he returned.
等等，有一个人选。卡吉先生虽与 NERV 保持距离，却值得信赖，而且他似乎有能力探查到一些内情。可惜上次交谈时他提到要离开一阵子。看来只能等他回来了。

He got out of bed, not desiring to spend any more time sitting around on his own than necessary. The door was directly opposite the bed, and he headed out into the corridor, turning left to see a certain red-haired girl.
他起床后，不愿多花时间独自闲坐。门正对床铺，他径直走向走廊，左转去见那位红发女孩。

She got out of bed, sick of sitting around doing nothing when she felt fine. The door was to the right of the bed, and she headed out into the corridor, turning right to see a certain brown-haired boy.
她从床上起身，厌倦了明明感觉不错却无所事事地坐着。床右侧是门，她走出去进入走廊，右转时看到了一个棕色头发的男孩。

No words needed to be spoken. It took only a second for their arms to be around each other again, as each did their best to console the other. There was no embarrassment about their situation, it was simply a means of emotional support. Any ideas about... seeing how things would go between them could come later, once the ripped open scars of their past were given time to close back up again.
无需言语，仅一瞬，他们的手臂便再次紧紧相拥，彼此尽力安慰。面对此情此景，他们并无尴尬，这只是情感上的相互扶持。至于两人关系将如何发展，可待日后考虑，让过往的创伤有时间慢慢愈合。

Besides, they were already thinking... together... now?
另外，他们已经在共同思考……现在吗？

They slowly came apart, staring in shock into each other's eyes as the last few minutes finally caught up with them. They had both woken up at the same time, had identical thoughts, walked out of their rooms at the same time, and despite not having said a word they both knew that the other had thought the exact same way as them.
他们缓缓分开，震惊地凝视着彼此的眼睛，直到最后几分钟的感受终于涌上心头。两人同时醒来，心有灵犀，同时走出各自的房间，尽管未发一言，却都明白对方与自己心意相通。

An incredibly appropriate German curse forced its way past two pairs of lips.
一句恰到好处的德语咒骂，不由自主地从两个人的口中脱口而出。

Alright. No. Let's relax. Considering what they'd both been through previously, was it any real surprise that their synchronisation had reached this point?
好吧，不急，先放松一下。考虑到他们各自之前的经历，他们的同步性能达到这种程度，真的有那么令人惊讶吗？

Well, not really, come to think of it. The last time this had happened, they'd both almost been one mind in two bodies after being trapped inside an Angel for far too long, and that had been quite confusing until they had been put in separate rooms with different layouts. But this time, even that seemingly had no effect.
实际上，仔细想来并非如此。上次类似情况发生时，他们因长时间被困在天使体内，几乎融为一体，直到被分隔在布局各异的房间里才逐渐理清思绪。然而这次，即便采取了同样措施，似乎也未见成效。

So what? They both knew what the other person was thinking now. It could only make them even better pilots if they were this synchronised without needing an Evangelion. This could be freaking awesome.
那又如何？他们此刻心意相通，无需借助福音战士便能如此默契，无疑将使他们成为更卓越的飞行员。这实在是太令人兴奋了。

But it was... kind of invasive wasn't it? Now they wouldn't have any secrets between them.
但这确实有点...侵犯隐私，不是吗？现在他们之间将毫无秘密可言。

They were already as close as it was possible to be without being... well... romantically involved. And they had both already seen the darkest times of each other's lives.
他们已亲密无间，除非发展成恋情，否则难以更进一步。两人都曾目睹对方生命中最阴暗的时光。

...Speaking of romance- ...说起浪漫-

A polite cough came from down the hall. "Um, excuse me. Ms Soryu? Mr Ikari?"
走廊远处传来一声礼貌的咳嗽声。“嗯，不好意思，打扰了。索里乌女士，碇先生？”

Belatedly, they both realised that somehow they had just had what seemed to be an entire conversation without words or even what would probably be considered thoughts. Thoughts still took time to actually be made, while this... whatever it was had happened almost in a flash. Was there even a term for it? Or were they just imagining things?
后来他们才意识到，不知何故，他们刚刚进行了一场看似完整的对话，没有言语，甚至可能连通常意义上的思考都没有。思考仍需时间形成，而这种...无论它是什么，几乎在一瞬间发生。这有专门的术语吗？还是他们只是在臆想？

"Er..." 嗯...

The person was still waiting for them to respond. They both turned to see a vaguely familiar nurse. It took them a moment to realise why she was familiar. She was the nurse that hehad upset the last time he had woken up in this place. This was the bland nurse. The one he had probably scared by acting weird upon waking up after the Fourteenth Angel.
那人还在等他们的回复。两人一同回头，发现一位似曾相识的护士。他们稍作思索，才想起她为何面熟。她就是上次他在这儿醒来时冒犯过的那位护士。这位不起眼的护士，可能在上次因第十四使徒事件醒来时，因他的怪异行为而受到了惊吓。

"Ye-" They stopped, carefully checking themselves to ensure they were speaking Japanese and not German, and tried again. "Yes? What is it?"
他们停顿了一下，确认自己说的是日语而非德语后，再次问道：“怎么了？有什么事吗？”

The eyes of the nonplussed nurse flicked back and forth between them for a few seconds before she gamely pressed on. "Um... I take it you are both feeling alright now?"
困惑的护士目光在他们之间游移了几秒，随后鼓起勇气继续问：“呃...你们现在应该都还好吧？”

"We're fine now," they said. "Probably just tired. Can we go home yet? We don't want to spend any longer in here than we have to."
我们现在还好，"他们说。"可能只是累了。能回家了吗？我们不想在这里多待。

"Oh... um..." The nurse checked the chart she was holding. "W-well, there's nothing here about keeping you from leaving, but... oh! Apparently Doctor Akagi wants to talk to both of you as soon as you're awake. Which... would be now I suppose?"
哦... 呃..." 护士翻看着手中的病历。"嗯，没看到有阻止您离开的指示，不过... 哦！赤木医生似乎想在你们醒来后立即与你们交谈。现在... 应该就是现在了。

They nodded. Of course something would get in their way. Something always did. "Alright, where is she?"
他们点头表示同意。事情总是这样，总会有障碍出现。“那么，她现在在哪里？”

The nurse, after staring at them for a couple of uncomfortable seconds, bowed and said, "Please give me a few minutes to contact her."
护士尴尬地凝视了他们几秒后，鞠躬说道：“请稍等，我这就联系她。”

Well. In the meantime, they could at least get dressed. A shower was going to have to wait until they got home, where she could fix her hair up.
嗯，至少他们可以先穿好衣服。洗澡只能回家再说了，到时候她才能打理头发。

...He was not ready to go that far with their synchronisation.
...他尚未准备好与他们的同步达到如此深度。

Good, because she wasn't suggesting that.
挺好的，她本来就没那么建议。

Their faces turning red, they returned to their rooms for the time being.
他们脸颊泛红，暂时各自回房。

When Ritsuko was woken up by the call informing her that Shinji and Asuka were awake, she did what anybody else would when trying to catch up on sleep only to be rudely awoken: share the pain. After all, why suffer from inadequate sleep alone when she could wake up Misato and drag her along as well? Besides, once the paperwork was done Misato would likely end up back in the brig until the investigation was over. At least this way she could get her friend a little more time out in the open.
得知真嗣和明日香醒来后，律子被电话吵醒，她像任何人一样，在试图补觉却被打断时，选择分享这份痛苦。为什么不叫醒美里，让她也一起受这份罪呢？毕竟，文书工作一结束，美里很可能就会被关进禁闭室直到调查结束。至少这样，她能给好友多争取一些自由的时间。

Ritsuko thought she knew what to expect from those two strange kids this time. They were already known for annoying people with their synchronised conversations; how could things get weirder than that?
律子原以为这次对那两个怪异孩子的举动已心中有数。他们因同步对话惹人烦而声名在外；还能有什么比这更离谱的呢？

As it turned out, there was still another layer to the weirdness. They were speaking in sync as they tended to, but this time it didn't seem to be out of a desire to irritate. Now they were doing it... because they had developed some sort of hive mind. Before, they would at least glance at each other occasionally, but now it seemed like they were literally on the same wavelength. Ritsuko briefly considered giving them both a brain scan, but she was fairly sure the results weren't going to properly explain a damn thing.
事实证明，这种怪异背后还隐藏着另一层。他们习惯性地同步发言，然而这次并非为了惹人生厌。如今他们这么做……是因为他们之间形成了某种集体意识。以往他们至少还会偶尔互望，现在却仿佛完全同频。Ritsuko 曾考虑为他们进行脑部扫描，但她确信结果也无法解释这诡异现象。

Last time, when they had woken up after being absorbed by Leliel, their synchronisation had caused problems when they couldn't work out who was Shinji and who was Asuka. Changing their room layouts and forcing them to do things differently had eventually broken them out of it. Now, though, they seemed fully capable of functioning as one mind in two bodies.
上次，他们被雷里尔吸收后醒来，因无法区分谁是真嗣、谁是明日香，同步出现了问题。通过改变房间布局和迫使他们采取不同行动，最终帮助他们摆脱了困境。如今，他们似乎已能完美地以一个心灵操控两个身体。

Ritsuko had sent Shinji and Misato into the next room over, and yet she could still essentially talk to Misato. Asuka heard her words, and Shinji would relay them to Misato, who would give her reply to him for Asuka to tell to Ritsuko. This would have been an incredibly interesting phenomenon to study, if only it was actually replicable and there wasn't the tiny issue of the Angels and Evangelions requiring all of NERV's scientific focus.
律子安排真嗣和美里去了隔壁房间，却依然能与美里保持沟通。明日香听到了律子的话，真嗣则将这些话传达给美里，美里再通过真嗣回复，由明日香转告律子。这一现象若能复制，本应是极具研究价值的，无奈使徒和 EVA 的存在让 NERV 不得不将所有科研精力集中于此，这一小问题便显得无关紧要了。

Eventually though, she had to get everyone back into the same room again. A much more important matter needed to be dealt with now: The Committee were almost desperate to talk to the pilots of Unit-02. They had made the request before, but the mental states of Shinji and Asuka would have only been worsened by their method of questioning at that time. This time, however...
最终，她不得不再次召集所有人回到同一房间。眼下有一件更为紧要的事务亟待处理：委员会迫切希望与二号机的飞行员进行对话。他们之前曾提出过请求，但那时采用的审问手段只会加剧真嗣和明日香的心理负担。而这一次，情况将有所不同...

Well, she dearly wished she could see the looks on the faces of the old men during the meeting.
哎，她真想亲眼看看那些老者在会议中脸上的表情。

XXX

Twelve grey monoliths ringed the circle of light they were made to stand in. Complete blackness surrounded them, making it impossible to know how big the room was. The monoliths themselves simply had a number from one to twelve and the words SOUND ONLY written on them.
十二座灰色巨碑环绕着它们所处的光环排列。四周一片漆黑，无从得知房间的规模。巨碑上只刻有一至十二的数字和“仅供声音”的标识。

"Second Child, Asuka Langley-Soryu. Third Child, Shinji Ikari."
第二适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。第三适格者，碇真嗣。

It wasn't even clear which monolith was speaking. All of this secrecy immediately put them on the defensive. Whatever this Human Instrumentality Committee was, if they were this paranoid about two of the people charged to defend the planet from hostile invaders knowing anything about them, then they deserved no trust in return.
究竟是哪个巨型机构在发言，都无从得知。这种神秘莫测的态度立刻让他们心生戒备。无论这个所谓的“人类补完委员会”是什么来头，如果他们对两个肩负保卫地球重任的人都要如此严防死守，那么他们自然也不值得我们信任。

"Yes sir," they stolidly replied, choosing not to bother focusing on any particular monolith and instead stand at parade rest, staring at some invisible point in the darkness ahead of them.
"是的，先生，"他们面无表情地应答，不去特别关注任何巨石，而是保持立正姿态，凝视着前方黑暗中某个虚无的点。

There was a slight inhalation of breath from one of the monoliths, then a different voice said, "Do the two of you know why you have been summoned here?"
一块巨石轻吸一口气，紧接着另一个声音响起：“你们俩可知道为何被召至此地？”

"No, sir." 不是的，先生。

There was a pause, and a suggestion that a quick hidden conversation was taking place.
一阵沉默后，似乎有一场迅速且不为人知的对话正在进行。

"You have been called here so that we may question you about the latest Angel attack," said the second voice. "During that attack, it is believed that the Angel employed a weapon that affected your minds."
你被召来此地，是为了就最近的天使袭击事件接受我们的询问，"第二个人说道。"在那次袭击中，据信天使使用了能影响你们心智的武器。

Another voice cut in. "What we want to know is whether or not the Angel attempted to communicate with you."
另一个声音打断说：“我们关心的是，天使有没有尝试和你交流。”

Yet another voice. "We had a similar concern when the Twelfth Angel absorbed Unit-01, but according to the recording of your debriefing nothing of the sort occurred."
另一个声音指出：“第十二使徒吞噬零号机时，我们同样心存疑虑，然而根据你的汇报录音显示，并未出现类似情形。”

"That's right. Nothing and nobody spoke to us besides each other."
没错。除了我们彼此，没有任何人或事物与我们交流。

There was a long pause, a voice that said, "What the he-" before being silenced. Again, the Committee seemed to be speaking to each other. If these people were unnerved by their synchronisation, then so much the better. They mentally grinned; it was the little things.
一阵漫长的沉默后，一个声音刚要说“搞什么——”便戛然而止。委员会成员似乎又在彼此交流。如果这些人因他们的同步感到不安，那再好不过。他们心中暗自得意；正是这些小细节。

"And what about this time?" the second voice pressed. "Did this Angel attempt to communicate?"
这次又如何？"第二个声音紧追不舍，"那位天使是否尝试过交流？

"No, not as far as we could tell," they replied. It was time to see how vague they could get. "We both just experienced a bad memory from our past, There was nothing that we could definitively say was an Angel."
不，至少我们没看出来，"他们答道。接下来，他们要看看自己能含糊其辞到什么地步。"我们俩都只是回想起了过去的一段不愉快记忆，并没有什么确凿的迹象表明那是天使。

"That is all? A memory?"
就这些吗？只是一段记忆？

"Hrm. Perhaps the Angel's attack was meant to destabilise its victim to help ensure an easy victory."
嗯。也许天使的攻击是为了让受害者陷入混乱，从而确保轻松获胜。

"Assaulting the mind, from so great a distance, with even an AT-Field unable to provide any protection..."
从遥远之处攻击心灵，即便 AT 力场也无力防护……

They remained silent while the men debated openly. Finally, one of them seemed to remember that they were still in the room. "One last question. Are you aware of how the Angel was actually killed?"
他们沉默不语，而男人们则在公开讨论。最后，有人似乎想起来他们还在场。“最后一个问题，你们知道天使究竟是怎么遇害的吗？”

"No, nobody told us how the Angel died. Why?"
不，没人告诉我们天使是如何离世的。有什么原因吗？

"You may not ask questions!"
你不能提问！

Their eyes narrowed slightly.
他们微微眯起了眼睛。

"That is all, pilots. Dismissed."
就这些了，飞行员们。解散。

The monoliths faded away. Turning around, they headed towards the emergency exit sign; the only indication that this black void had a door.
巨石隐没不见。他们转过身，朝着紧急出口的指示牌走去，那是这漆黑一片中唯一的出口标识。

Out in the corridor, they were finally able to feel like they could breathe normally. The entire meeting had been a complete waste of time. But at least they could go home now.
走廊里，他们终于能正常呼吸了。整个会议纯属浪费时间，好在现在可以回家了。

No, there was still one more thing that had to be done.
不，还有一件事非做不可。

...Did he want her to come with him?
他是否希望她一同前往？

The thought was appreciated, but this was something he had to do himself...relatively speaking.
虽然这个想法值得肯定，但这事儿他还是得自己来...从某种程度上说。

Then in that case she was going to pay a quick visit to Glasses, to see if anything had changed. There was a momentary flash of guilt; they had not really thought about their fellow pilot in quite a while.
既然如此，她决定去格拉斯那里看看情况是否有变。心中闪过一丝愧疚，毕竟他们已经很久没有真正关心过那位同伴飞行员了。

With a glance at each other and a nod -some physical gestures still felt necessary- they set off in different directions. No matter what happened, it would be alright. With such a strong synchronisation, moral support was always at hand.
他们相视一眼，点头示意——某些肢体动作依旧不可或缺——随即分道扬镳。无论遭遇何事，皆能安然度过。这份深厚的默契，总能及时给予彼此精神上的慰藉。

The secretary behind the desk near the imposing double doors looked up from her computer as he approached, frowning as she seemingly tried to work out if the son of Commander Ikari was permitted to enter his office without being summoned. She stood up, but a voice from the intercom made things much clearer for her.
当碇真嗣走近时，坐在宏伟双开门旁桌后的秘书从电脑前抬起头，皱眉思索着司令的儿子是否可以未经召唤就进入办公室。她正要起身，对讲机里传来的声音已为她解惑。

"Let him enter." 让他进来吧。

She glanced at the intercom, then up at Shinji and shrugged, waving him towards the door as she sat back down. Shinji gave her a slight nod, opened the door, and stepped into the most imposing room in the world.
她瞥了眼对讲机，随即抬头望向真嗣，耸肩示意他去开门，自己则重新坐下。真嗣对她轻点一下头，推开门，迈进了那间举世无双的庄严房间。

From the door to the desk, Shinji felt like he had to walk a kilometre before coming to a halt a couple of metres away from his father. Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki was there as well, looking strangely worn out, and Shinji felt both pairs of eyes on him for his entire trek across the room. His stomach felt like it wanted to jump out his mouth and escape, but he swallowed it back down.
从门口走到桌边，真嗣感觉像是要跋涉千米才能停步，离父亲不过几米距离。副司令冬月同样在场，神情疲惫异常，真嗣能感觉到两双眼睛始终紧盯着他穿越房间的每一步。他的胃仿佛要跃出口中逃离，但他强忍着将其压下。

His father was leaning forward in his chair, hands interlaced in front of his mouth. Shinji idly realised that the only time he had not seen the man sitting like that was when he was standing up.
他的父亲坐在椅子上，身体前倾，双手交叠在嘴前。真嗣忽然意识到，只有当父亲站起来时，他才没见过这样的坐姿。

"Father," he said by way of greeting.
"父亲，"他以此作为打招呼的方式。

The elder Ikari's head tilted forward a millimetre. "Shinji. You have a good reason for coming here."
老碇的头略微向前倾了一点点。“真嗣，你来这儿肯定有你的道理。”

It wasn't a question. Of course, Shinji had never made an attempt to speak to his father on his own terms, and considering recent circumstances it would of course be more than just an attempt at a family conversation.
这其实算不上一个问题。毕竟，真嗣从未主动尝试按自己的意愿与父亲沟通，鉴于近来的情形，这次尝试显然不只是简单的家庭对话。

Then again, this was going to be a conversation about family.
再者，这次谈话原本就是围绕家庭展开的。

"I know what happened," Shinji bluntly stated, not taking his eyes off his father.
"我知道发生了什么，"真嗣直截了当地说道，目光始终未从父亲身上移开。

There was a pause, then a slight inhalation of breath from Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, presumably as he worked out what Shinji meant. He turned and bowed. "I shall leave you two alone to discuss this," he said before making his exit from the room. Neither Ikari took their eyes off each other as the old man made his exit. When the door closed, barely audible from this distance, Shinji's father did something he would never have expected.
短暂的沉默后，副指挥官冬月似乎明白了真嗣的意图，他深吸一口气，转身鞠躬道：“你们俩单独谈谈吧。”说完便离开了房间。老人离去时，碇父子俩的目光始终紧紧相锁。门轻轻关上，声音微不可闻，此时，真嗣的父亲做出了一个他万万没想到的举动。

Both gloved hands rose up to his orange glasses, removed them, and placed them on the desk. His hands then interlaced again, but his arms remained on the desk, encircling the glasses like a wall. "The Angel," he began. "It unlocked your memories of your mother."
他戴着皮手套的双手抬起，摘下橙色眼镜放在桌上。接着双手再次交叠，双臂却依旧搁在桌上，仿佛一道围墙般环绕着眼镜。“天使，”他开始说道，“它唤醒了你关于母亲的记忆。”

"Yes," said Shinji. He paused a moment, then clarified. "Well... to be more precise, while we were trapped in its beam, I saw Asuka's memory of her mother's death, and she saw how mum died."
是的，" 真嗣说道。他稍作停顿，接着补充道："确切来说，在被那光束困住时，我目睹了明日香关于她母亲去世的记忆，而她也看到了我母亲去世的情形。

Father raised an eyebrow slightly. "Each other's memory. Intriguing, but at this point not exactly unexpected, considering your... unusual bond."
父亲略微挑眉，说道：“彼此的记忆，挺有意思的。不过考虑到你们那不同寻常的联系，这倒也不算太意外。”

Shinji didn't know whether he should elaborate further just yet; if he should mention that he knew his mother was still alive, in a sense, in Unit-01. For now, he chose to play it safe. "I'm still not sure if it's a good or bad thing, to be honest. On one hand, I finally know what mum looked like. On the other..."
真嗣犹豫是否该继续深入解释，是否该透露他知道母亲某种程度上仍存活于零号机中。眼下，他决定保持谨慎。“说实话，我还没法判断这是好是坏。一方面，我终于见到了妈妈的模样。另一方面……”

"You also remember precisely how she died," Father finished. "I was rather hoping you would never recall that detail, as someone who must relive that memory constantly; fresh as the day it happened."
你同样清楚地记得她的死因，"父亲接着说。"我曾希望你永远不会想起那个细节，毕竟你得不断重温那段记忆，仿佛一切就发生在昨日。

Shinji fell silent, suddenly dreading the days to come. The mental presence of Asuka did little to ease his concerns, especially since she now felt worried too.
碇真嗣突然陷入沉默，对未来几日心生畏惧。明日香的精神陪伴并未减轻他的忧虑，尤其是她现在也感到了不安。

Father's voice cut through the gloom. "Do not fear, Shinji. That is but one memory you have. Remember that there are many more memories, many happier memories."
父亲的声音划破了阴霾。“真嗣，别害怕。那不过是你众多记忆之一。要记得，还有许多其他的记忆，许多更快乐的记忆。”

That... hadn't actually occurred to him, somehow. Even now, one of those happier memories slowly began manifesting in his head.
他之前竟未曾想到这一点，真是奇怪。此刻，一段较为愉快的记忆正缓缓浮现在他的脑海中。

A hot, cloudless day. Himself and Mum, walking down the street hand in hand. An umbrella in her other hand giving much needed shade to the two of them, and an ice cream slowly melting over his free hand despite his efforts to finish it off quickly.
烈日当空，万里无云。他和妈妈手牵手漫步街头。妈妈另一只手撑着伞，为他们俩遮挡炙热的阳光，而他手中的冰淇淋，尽管他急忙吃着，仍不免渐渐融化。

The tiniest of smiles broke out on Father's face, the mere sight of it enough to shove Shinji back to the present in sheer surprise.
父亲脸上掠过一丝微弱的笑意，仅此一瞥便让真嗣惊愕地回到了现实。

"Yes," said Father. "If you find yourself beset by bad memories, force yourself to recall the good ones. That is what I do."
是的，"父亲说道，"当你被不愉快的记忆缠绕时，试着去回想那些美好的时光。我通常就是这样应对的。

"I... yeah," replied Shinji. "Um... thank you, father."
我...嗯，" 真嗣回应道。"呃...谢谢您，爸爸。

"Hrm. Now then, is there anything else?" Father picked up his glasses, preparing to put them back on his face.
"嗯，那么，还有其他事情吗？"父亲拿起眼镜，准备重新戴上。

"Well... one thing maybe, but it's minor and you might already know by now."
或许有一点小事，不过微不足道，你可能已经知道了。

The gloved hands paused, glasses halfway to his face. "...No, I cannot say I do."
戴着手套的手顿住了，眼镜举到半空。“……不，我得说我没有。”

Shinji nervously rubbed the back of his head. She seemed about ready to mentally slap him, but he pushed on. "Well, it's... mum's necklace. I found it not long ago, hidden among my stuff that was still packed from when I moved here. For some reason I kept forgetting about it, I mean... I would be holding it in my hand and somehow my thoughts would just... slide off of it."
真嗣紧张地挠着后脑勺。她似乎快要忍不住要给他一个心理上的耳光了，但他还是继续说道：“嗯，这是...妈妈的项链。不久前我在搬来这里后还没整理的行李中发现了它。不知为何，我总是忘记它的存在，我是说...我明明手里正握着它，但思绪就是会...莫名其妙地从它上面溜走。”

Father's eyebrows rose. "That sounds like it may have been a side-effect of your... amnesia concerning your mother."
父亲眉头一挑，说道：“这听起来像是关于你母亲记忆丧失的……副作用。”

Shinji nodded. "I'm pretty sure that's exactly what it was. I do remember seeing a very brief memory of myself trying to grab the necklace when it was around her neck, but at the time I had no idea who the other person was." He took a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh. "Anyway, I managed to remember it long enough during Asuka's birthday party and I... kind of... gave it to her as a gift?"
碇真嗣点头道：“我确信那正是当时的情形。我记得自己曾短暂地看到过一段记忆，当时我试图从她脖子上抓取那条项链，但那时我并不知道另一个人是谁。”他深吸一口气，长长地叹了出来。“总之，我在明日香的生日派对上想起了这件事，于是我……算是……把它当作礼物送给了她。”

A slow blink was the only response his father gave for several tense seconds. "I had wondered where that necklace disappeared to. I suppose I should have realised it was in your possession." That tiny suggestion of a smile returned as he put his glasses back on. "You were rather... obsessed with that sapphire when you were younger. Yui always had to keep taking your hands, and on one occasion your mouth, away from it."
他的父亲在紧张的几秒钟内仅以一个缓慢的眨眼作为回应。"我一直在纳闷那条项链怎么不见了。现在想来，我早该猜到它在你那里。"当他重新戴上眼镜时，那微弱的笑意再次浮现。"你小时候对那颗蓝宝石真是...着迷得很。结城经常得把你的手，甚至有一次是你的嘴，从它旁边拉开。"

Shinji's face reddened; Asuka's worry was immediately replaced with cackling laughter. At his expense no less. "Um... so... are you okay with me giving it to Asuka? It wasn't exactly mine to give away."
真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕，明日香原本的担忧瞬间转为放声大笑，还是以真嗣为笑柄。"呃...那么...你同意我把这个给明日香吗？毕竟它本不属于我，不能随意赠送。"

Father gave a small flick of a hand. "It is not mine to decide either. At the very least we now know where it is. As long as its new owner appreciates it and does not attempt to sell it, I do not mind."
父亲轻挥一下手，说道：“这事我也做不了主。至少现在我们知道它的下落了。只要新主人懂得珍惜，不打算卖掉，我便无异议。”

One of Shinji's hands began to raise towards his collarbone, and he had to quickly turn it into what he hoped was a thoughtful chin rub. "Yes," he said. "I do believe its new owner does like it."
真嗣的一只手不由自主地抬向锁骨，他急忙顺势做出摸下巴的动作，试图显得若有所思。“没错，”他回应道，“我觉得新主人确实对它很满意。”

"Well then." Father shifted slightly in his chair, one hand reaching towards the keyboard on his desk. "With that matter settled, I must return to my work. And I believe you are still recovering from this latest Angel attack. You have already been cleared to return home, so I suggest you do so and get some rest. There is no telling when another Angel will strike."
那么，父亲在椅子上略微调整了坐姿，一只手伸向桌上的键盘。'既然那件事已经处理妥当，我得继续工作了。况且，你还在从最近这次天使袭击中恢复。你已经获准回家，我建议你回去好好休息。谁也不知道天使何时会再次发动攻击。'

Shinji nodded, turning it into an awkward bow. "Yes, father. Um... goodbye."
碇真嗣点头致意，却显得有些局促，转而形成了一个尴尬的鞠躬。“是的，父亲。嗯...再见。”

"Goodbye, Shinji." 再见，新世纪福音战士。

Standing up straight, Shinji pivoted around and began to walk towards the double doors.
挺直腰杆，真嗣转过身，开始向那对双开门走去。

"Oh yes," he heard from behind him. "Pilot Soryu."
哦，没错，"他身后传来声音。"是飞行员 Soryu。

"Huh?" Shinji looked back over his shoulder. "Asuka? What about her?"
嗯？" 真嗣回头问道。"明日香？她出什么事了吗？

The glasses were back on his father's face, but Shinji could still feel those eyes boring into his head. "Pilot Soryu," he repeated. "You will not hurt my son. This is your only warning."
眼镜再次戴在了他父亲的脸上，但真嗣依旧能感受到那锐利的目光直刺他的脑海。“Soryu 驾驶员，”他再次强调，“你绝不能伤害我的儿子。这是唯一的警告。”

Shinji opened his mouth... but it immediately clicked shut as realisation struck him. Him and her. Finding words impossible, he simply gave a shaky nod of his head before swiftly heading out of the room.
真嗣刚要开口...却突然意识到什么，嘴巴立刻闭上了。他和她之间。无法用言语表达，他只是颤抖着点了点头，随即匆匆离开了房间。

Out in the corridor, with the secretary's desk behind him, they let out a breath they didn't know they had been holding. It should have come as no surprise that his father managed to see straight through them. And warned her.
在走廊中，秘书桌后，他们不自觉地松了口气。父亲能洞察他们的心思，这本不足为奇，他还特意提醒了她。

He could only hope that her detour was much less eventful.
他唯有期盼她的绕行之路能少些波折。

XXX

It was a long slog through NERV's corridors. She knew she was going the right way, and yet still felt like she had doubled back on her path at one point. By the time she reached the door plastered with biohazard symbols, his meeting with his father was already over. That was kind of a good thing, as it would have been rather awkward for both of them if, say, she had been surprised by Commander Ikari talking directly to her.
她穿越 NERV 的走廊，一路跋涉漫长。尽管确信自己走的是正道，却仍有一瞬感觉像是绕回了原路。等她来到贴满生物危害标志的门前，他与父亲的会面已然落幕。这未尝不是件好事，毕竟若指挥官碇源堂突然与她对话，双方都会感到尴尬。

"This is Pilot Soryu," Asuka said into the intercom next to the airlock door, doing her best to focus on one thing at a time for now. Fortunately Shinji was simply wandering through corridors as well, heading for the NERV motor pool where they would meet once she was done here. "Can I come in for a few minutes to check on Pilot Aida?"
我是飞行员惣流，"明日香对着气闸门旁的对讲机说道，努力集中精力处理眼前的事务。幸运的是，真嗣同样在走廊中漫步，正朝 NERV 的车库走去，他们约定在那里碰头，待她处理完手头事务。"我可以进来几分钟，看看相田飞行员的情况吗？

The response was quick. "Doctor Akagi cleared all three of you pilots to visit whenever you wish, so come on in."
回复非常快。"秋木医生已经允许你们三位飞行员随时来访，快请进。"

After going through the airlock, Asuka saw the same white-haired young man as last time manning the station. Or rather, standing at the window looking into the next room with hands clasped behind his back.
穿过气闸，明日香又见到了那位白发青年，他正站在站台，准确来说，是站在窗边，双手背在身后，凝视着隔壁的房间。

"I know that this is a very bad situation your friend is in," he said without turning around. "But I cannot help but be intrigued by it."
我明白你朋友现在的处境很糟，"他背对着说，"可我实在忍不住对此产生了兴趣。

"What, you mean scientific curiosity?" Asuka stood next to him at the window, eyes locked on the box in the next room containing her fellow pilot.
"什么，你是指科学上的好奇心吗？" 明日香站在他身旁，透过窗户紧盯着隔壁房间里装有她同伴驾驶员的箱子。

"Indeed. The remains of an alien species, attempting to consume a human for... what reason? The Angel itself is gone, destroyed along with Unit-03, but its... flesh I suppose, continues on." The man moved over to his station, leaning over to tap on the keyboard. "There has been a change recently, though we can't tell at present if it's a good or bad thing.
确实如此。这是一种外星物种的遗骸，试图吞噬人类，究竟出于何种目的？那使徒已随三号机一同毁灭，但其...肉体，姑且这么说，仍在持续。" 男子走向工作站，俯身敲击键盘。"最近出现了一些变化，但我们目前还无法判断其利弊。

A screen lit up, showing Kensuke still mostly covered by the pulsating bluish mass. His head was the only part seemingly unaffected, but there were hints of blue lines beginning to travel up his neck. Asuka frowned; something seemed different compared to the last time she was in here.
屏幕亮起，映出健介仍被脉动的蓝色物质覆盖大半的身体。唯有头部看似未受波及，然而蓝色线条已开始沿着他的颈部向上攀爬。明日香眉头紧锁，感觉与上次来此有所不同。

"I believe you may have already noticed a change," said the man.
"我想你或许已经察觉到了变化，"男子说道。

Asuka quickly glanced at him... and had to stop herself from recoiling in surprise. The man was looking back at her... with his red eyes.
明日香快速地瞥了他一眼，差点因惊讶而本能地后退。那男人正用他那双红色的眼睛回望着她。

His shock combined with hers, and her eyes shot wide open. This person... were they like Rei?
他的震惊与她的交织在一起，她的双眼猛然睁大。这个人……难道和零一样吗？

The man blinked several times, then shook his head. "Ah. Sorry," he apologised. "My eyes always seem to get a response like that, so I try not to look at people too much."
那人眨了眨眼，随后摇摇头。“啊，抱歉，”他带着歉意说，“我的眼睛老是这样，所以我通常避免过多地直视他人。”

"N-no," Asuka stammered, some of him coming to the forefront. She cleared her throat. "I should be apologising for reacting that way." After all, Wondergirl looked just as strange as this person and they were just fine with her. "I... guess I'm more surprised that there's someone else at NERV with red eyes."
不，" 明日香有些结巴，内心的某些情绪显露出来。她清了清嗓子，说道："其实我应该为自己的过激反应道歉。" 毕竟，Wondergirl 的外貌同样与众不同，大家却对她很接纳。"我... 我只是没想到在 NERV 还会有其他人拥有红眼睛。

The man tilted his head slightly. "Another person? Well, you have me at an advantage there, as I have not met them. Just my shift supervisor and the others who work in this room, really."
那人略微歪了歪头，说：“还有别人吗？看来您比我了解得多，我还没遇到过其他人。这里我只认识我的班组长和同室的同事们。”

Asuka could now sense the burning question that he was curious about, and to be honest she wanted to know too. NERV was full of strangeness, as well as suspicion lately, and two different people with odd hair and red eyes associated with the organisation seemed to be too much of a coincidence. Now didn't seem to be the right time, however. She did take a moment to check the name tag on his uniform, which proclaimed him to be one Technician Nagisa.
明日香此刻能感受到他心中那股强烈的好奇，坦白讲，她自己也想探个究竟。NERV 近来怪事频发，疑云重重，两个头发异样、眼眸猩红的人物与组织有所牵连，这巧合未免太过蹊跷。只是眼下并非追问的良机。她还是抽空瞥了一眼他制服上的名牌，得知此人名叫技术员渚薰。

"Well... anyway," she said, turning back to the screen showing Kensuke. "You were saying something about a change?"
嗯... 不管怎样，" 她转回屏幕，对着显示的健介说："你刚才提到有什么变化来着？

"...Ah, yes!" Nagisa replied after looking at her for a second longer than was comfortable. He tapped on the keyboard again and the view on the screen zoomed in slightly. "As you perhaps noticed, the mass covering Pilot Aida has decreased. Not enough to signify that it is dying off, but it is still a visible change."
...啊，没错！" 渚在多看了她一眼，时间稍长到令人不适后回答道。他再次敲击键盘，屏幕上的画面略微放大。"或许你已经注意到，覆盖飞行员绫的物质有所减少。虽然不足以表明它正在消亡，但这一变化仍然显而易见。

Asuka leaned in closer to the screen. Indeed, there did seem to be less of the hideous goop... or was there? "Is it a decrease in its mass though?" she said out loud. "Or could it be that it's dissolved those parts of him it's covering?" Even as she said those words, he and she had to repress a shudder. Nobody deserved a fate like that.
明日香贴近屏幕细看。确实，那种令人作呕的粘液似乎有所减少……还是只是错觉？“这是否表示它的质量真的减少了？”她自言自语，“还是说它溶解了覆盖的那部分身体？”即便在说出这些话时，他和她都不得不强忍住颤抖。这样的命运，无人应承受。

Nagisa snapped his fingers, the gesture ending in him pointing at her. "Precisely. Either it is consuming your friend for sustenance, or it is slowly dying off, perhaps as his immune system adapts to it."
渚啪地打了个响指，随即指向她。“正是如此。要么它在吸取你朋友的生命力以维持自身，要么它正逐渐衰亡，或许是他的免疫系统已经适应并开始抵抗。”

"...Wait." There was, unfortunately, one other possibility. "It could be one of those two. Or... it's now being absorbed into his body."
...等等。"不幸的是，还存在另一种可能性。"可能是那两者之一。或者...它现在正被他的身体吸收。

"That... hrm." Nagisa cut himself off, looking thoughtful. "So now we're looking at a two-in-three chance that something bad is happening, rather than the fifty-fifty I was thinking of."
那...呃。" 渚顿了顿，显得若有所思。"看来我们现在面临的是三分之二的几率有坏事发生，而非我原先认为的各占一半。

Asuka folded her arms and growled. It already wasn't going to be long before NERV decided to pull the plug on Kensuke, and now things looked to be getting even worse.
明日香抱臂低吼，看来 NERV 对健介的支持即将终止，事态似乎正朝着更糟的方向发展。

But then a surprisingly optimistic thought came from him. "Oh, but it could still be fifty-fifty," she said since he wasn't around to say it. "Either it's eating him, dying off, being absorbed... or maybe the absorbing is part of how the immune system is fighting it off."
然而，他突然冒出了一个令人意外的乐观想法。"哦，不过结果还是有可能各占一半，"她这样说道，因为他不在场，无法亲自表达。"要么它在吞噬他，慢慢消亡，被吸收...或者这种吸收过程正是免疫系统与之抗争的一部分。"

"Well now, that is a surprising thought," said Nagisa, sounding impressed, but then his tone turned sombre again. "We really don't have much time left though. Either things start improving for him very quickly, or NERV will go ahead and euthanize him."
哎呀，这想法真让人意外，"渚薰赞叹道，但语气随即又沉重起来。"不过，我们剩下的时间确实不多了。要么他情况迅速改善，要么 NERV 就会决定对他进行安乐死。

"...So how long does he have?"
...那么，他还能坚持多久？

"Six days," Nagisa grimly replied. "Six days for a massive improvement in his condition, or NERV gives him the mercy of a swift and painless end."
六天，"渚严肃地回应，"六天内他的状况必须大幅好转，否则 NERV 会让他安详地离去。

He was slouched against a wall in the motor pool when she arrived. Misato was apparently going to be busy for quite a while, so they had to get home on their own, in a manner of speaking. It was too late for public transport, so now they were waiting for a couple of Section Two agents to sign out a car and take them home.
她抵达时，他正倚着机车库的墙壁，一副懒散模样。看来美里一时半会儿忙不完，他们得自己设法回家。由于公共交通已停运，此刻他们正等待两名第二科特工签出一辆车，以便送他们回去。

She leaned on the wall next to him, and together they let out a tired sigh. This entire day just seemed to be conspiring against them; an Angel attack, being mentally melded together even more thanks to said Angel attack, mounting suspicions about NERV's motives, and now learning that their friend and fellow pilot had less than a week to live. What could two teenagers do?
她倚在他旁边的墙上，两人不约而同地叹了口气。这一天似乎处处与他们为难：先是使徒的袭击，因这场袭击而心灵更加紧密相连，对 NERV 的疑虑不断累积，如今又得知他们的战友兼飞行员朋友生命仅剩不到一周。两个少年又能如何是好？

A left hand hesitantly moved sideways, soon meeting with a right hand. They clasped firmly onto each other, and their owners drew some comfort from the physical interaction. If anybody had been paying attention, it would have probably looked very much like two shy teenagers awkwardly flirting, but that was pretty much the furthest thing from their linked minds at the moment.
一只左手迟疑地向一侧挪动，不久便与一只右手相触。两只手紧紧握在一起，双方从这肢体接触中感受到了一丝慰藉。若有人留心观察，或许会觉得这场景酷似两个青涩少年在尴尬地示好，然而这并非他们此刻心之所系。

The agents came out of the motor pool office and waved at them; the men would have noticed the linked hands, but professionals that they were the agents did not even so much as quirk an eyebrow as they got into the car without releasing their hands. They sat down as close as was physically possibly without one sitting in the lap of the other, their hands resting on the point where their legs met. They did not so much as twitch for the entire journey to their apartment.
特工们从车队办公室走出，向他们挥手致意；尽管这些人可能会注意到紧握的双手，但作为训练有素的专业人士，特工们在上车时并未表现出任何惊讶，手也始终未曾松开。他们坐得如此之近，几乎要坐到对方腿上，手则自然地搭在两腿交叠处。从出发到抵达公寓，他们全程纹丝不动。

Only when they finally entered the apartment did they break apart, but it was with great reluctance. She had a lot of work to do to scrub the dried up LCL out of her hair, after all.
直到最终踏入公寓，他们才恋恋不舍地分开。毕竟，她得费不少劲才能把干结在头发里的 LCL 清洗干净。

Fate seemed to be conspiring to keep her hair looking hideous, however. The moment she entered the bathroom there was a knock at their front door. Confusion flooding their minds, as who would be so bold as to call at this hour, they both went to the door together. Opening it, they were greeted by the concerned face of Rei, who bowed slightly, opened her mouth to speak, but then paused and tilted her head, staring at them both.
命运仿佛有意让她的头发显得凌乱不堪。她刚进浴室，前门就响起了敲门声。两人心中满是疑惑，不知谁会在这种时候贸然造访，于是他们一起走向门口。开门一看，是瑞依带着关切的神情，她微微鞠躬，正要开口，却又停住，侧着头，目光在他们两人之间徘徊。

"If you're seeing anything weird," they tiredly said, "it's because the Angel's attack has done more synchronisation stuff to us."
如果你察觉到任何异常，"他们疲惫地说，"那是因为天使的攻击加剧了我们的同步效应。

"...I understand," Rei replied, blinking several times. "My apologies for calling at this hour, but a message came for Misato on the home phone while we were fighting the Angel. I..." she glanced away, looking... upset? "I believe that... the two of you should hear it."
...我明白了," 绫波丽回答，眨了眨眼。"抱歉在这个时候打扰，但我们在对抗使徒时，家里的电话收到了一条给美里小姐的信息。我..." 她目光转向别处，显得有些不安。"我觉得...你们俩应该听听这条信息。

Twinned expressions of puzzlement on their faces, they followed Rei next door to the kitchen where the answering machine sat on the edge of the bench. With an unreadable expression on her face, Rei pressed the playback button.
他们脸上都挂着同样的困惑，跟着零走进了隔壁的厨房，答录机就搁在台面边上。零面无表情地按下了播放键。

"Katsuragi... it's me." Katsuragi... 是我。

The voice, though slightly distorted by the speaker, was clearly Kaji's, but he didn't sound like his usual cheery self. What was he doing calling Misato's home phone during an Angel attack?
尽管声音因扬声器而有些许失真，但一听便知是加持的声音，然而他并不像平时那样兴致勃勃。在使徒来袭之际，他为何会拨通葛城家的座机呢？

"By the time you hear this message, you've probably gone through quite a bit of trouble thanks to me. Sorry about that. Oh, and please tell Rits I said sorry too. Make sure Shinji and Asuka get the chance to regularly tend to my garden. I'd hate to think those cute little watermelons would shrivel up and die. Cuteness should be preserved."
当你听到这条消息时，你大概已经因为我而经历了不少麻烦。对此我深感歉意。另外，请转告 Rits，我也向她表示歉意。请确保真嗣和明日香能定期照看我的花园。我实在不愿见到那些可爱的小西瓜枯萎凋零。可爱之物，值得我们珍惜与呵护。

Unease returned to their stomachs like an old friend. This wasn't a simple 'sorry I missed you' message. It sounded more like...
不安如旧友重访，再次涌上心头。这绝非简单的“抱歉错过你”的留言，其意味更为深长...

"Katsuragi, the truth is with you. Do not falter. Press on. And... if I see you again, I'll say the words I couldn't say eight years ago."
葛城，真相掌握在你手中。切勿犹豫，勇往直前。若能重逢，我将倾诉八年前未曾启齿的话语。

...Last words... ...最后的遗言...

"Goodbye." 再见。

XXX

"Major Katsuragi, thank you for your patience during this time. Our investigation has been completed and you are free to go."
葛城上尉，感谢您这段时间的耐心配合。调查现已结束，您可以离开了。

Misato stepped out of the cell once more, side-eyeing the man who had unlocked the door. She couldn't read anything from his face other than stoic professionalism, and there was little doubt that any questions she had would simply be rebuffed or ignored outright. A second man was there as well, holding out her HK USP and the magazine that had been loaded into it before she had been... asked to submit to time in the brig. Misato collected both, checking that the safety was on before inserting the magazine.
真嗣再次步出牢房，侧目观察着为她开门的男子。他的面容除了刻板的职业表情外，别无其他，她心知肚明，任何疑问都只会遭到拒绝或置之不理。另一名男子也在场，递给她之前被收缴的 HK USP 手枪及装填好的弹匣。真嗣接过，确认安全装置已启动后，将弹匣装入枪中。

Misato then chambered a round out of habit, causing both men to give her nervous looks that only faded when she holstered her weapon. .45 ACP certainly packed more of a punch than nine millimetre, but that came at the cost of reduced magazine size. And for all she knew, that extra round could make all the difference one day. She would just have to remember to replenish the magazine when she got home and could access the small stock of ammunition she was permitted to keep as the pilots' guardian.
出于习惯，Misato 随后习惯性地上了膛，这让两名男子紧张地看了她一眼，直到她将武器收起，他们的紧张才逐渐消退。.45 ACP 子弹的威力确实比九毫米子弹更大，但这也意味着弹匣容量减少。对她而言，多出的那一发子弹或许在关键时刻能起到决定性作用。她只需记得回家后补充弹匣，那时她可以接触到作为飞行员监护人被允许保留的小量弹药库存。

"Is there anything else, or can I finally go home and try to get some sleep?" Misato asked in an imperious tone. All her paperwork was done for the time being; there was still more to come but that depended on other people sending her what she needed. Even NERV had to sleep at some point.
"还有别的事吗，还是说我终于能回家睡会儿了？" 碇真嗣带着不容置疑的语气问道。她手头的文书工作暂时告一段落；尽管还有更多工作等着，但这取决于其他人是否将她所需的东西发给她。毕竟，NERV 的成员也需要休息。

Both men saluted, now that her rank once again held meaning. "No, ma'am," one of them said. "Section Two has nothing to report concerning the pilots either."
两人敬礼，此时她的军衔再次显得重要。"不，女士，"其中一人回答，"第二区同样没有关于飞行员的报告。"

Misato huffed. "I would damn well hope so." Without another word, she set off down the corridor.
真嗣哼了一声。“我当然希望如此。”她没再多言，径直沿着走廊走去。

Half an hour later, her Alpine A310 roared out of the NERV surface access point into the early morning sun, heading for home. The damn vehicle train seemed especially slow today, like it didn't particularly care how much she needed some proper sleep in a proper bed. Misato could feel her tiredness gently making itself known in the heaviness of her eyelids, and decided this was one of those times to play it safe on the road.
半小时后，她的阿尔派 A310 轰鸣着从 NERV 地面入口驶出，迎着清晨的阳光，驶向家中。那辆该死的车辆列车今天似乎特别慢，仿佛并不在意她多么渴望在一张舒适的床上好好睡上一觉。Misato 感到疲惫正悄然袭来，眼皮愈发沉重，她决定这次在路上要格外小心。

She managed to make it safely to her apartment building just before the sun was able to reach that awkward spot in the sky where she couldn't use the visor to shield her eyes from its glare. As she stepped into the elevator and stabbed at the button for her floor, she sighed heavily. At this rate she was likely going to be asleep all day, unless she tried to make do with a nap to get through until a more reasonable bed time.
她赶在太阳升到那个尴尬高度、遮阳板无法遮挡刺眼光线之前，安全回到了自己的公寓楼。走进电梯，用力戳了下楼层按钮，她长叹一声。照这情形，她恐怕会睡上一整天，除非选择小睡片刻，撑到更合适的睡觉时间。

Misato stepped into her apartment, and immediately paused; the kitchen light was still on for some reason. Did Rei forget to turn it off before going to bed? It seemed odd, considering the First Child was probably more dutiful than the average technician at NERV.
真嗣走进自己的公寓，立刻停下脚步；厨房的灯不知为何还亮着。难道是绫波在睡觉前忘记关灯了吗？考虑到她可能比 NERV 的普通技术人员还要尽责，这种情况显得有些反常。

After taking off her shoes, she headed into the kitchen and gave the answering machine its usual half-second's worth of attention, and then did a double take upon realising there was actually a message this time. Just as she was about to check it, she heard a sound from the lounge room that might have been a snore. Now things were starting to get odd; Rei hardly ever watched television, and certainly not in the middle of the night.
脱下鞋子，她步入厨房，习惯性地对答录机投去半秒的目光，旋即因发现这次真有留言而一愣。正要查看时，客厅传来疑似鼾声的响动。情况开始显得不寻常；Rei 几乎不在半夜看电视，更别说打鼾了。

A thought occurred, and Misato relaxed slightly. Of course; he had decided to sneak in again. She ruefully shook her head and headed towards the lounge room to confront him, one hand rolling the flash drive about in her pocket, ready to shove it back into his hands.
一个念头掠过心头，Misato 稍感宽慰。果不其然，他又打算悄悄潜入。她无奈地摇了摇头，向客厅走去，准备与他当面对峙，一只手在口袋里把玩着 U 盘，随时准备塞还给他。

"Alright, Kaji, wh-" was as far as she got before stopping in surprise. Rather than one person on the couch as she had expected, there were three. Three very familiar mops of hair; blue and brown, resting on the shoulders of red.
好吧，卡吉，她刚开口说：“好吧，卡吉，”就惊讶地停住了。沙发上并非她预料的一人，而是三人。三簇熟悉的头发，蓝与棕交织，倚靠在红色肩头。

In any other circumstance, Misato would have quickly pulled her phone out to snap a photo of an adorable moment. That urge still made itself known as she crept around to the front of the lounge chair and saw that Asuka was holding the hands of both Shinji and Rei. The only thing that stopped her from immortalising this moment on her phone were the expressions on all three sleeping faces; they were not the expressions of three peacefully snoozing people. And were those... tear stains on Asuka's face?
若在平时，Misato 定会立刻拿出手机，捕捉这温馨瞬间。当她悄然走到躺椅前，目睹 Asuka 紧握着 Shinji 和 Rei 的手时，这股冲动再次涌上心头。然而，阻止她用手机定格这一刻的，是三人沉睡面容上的表情；那并非平静安睡的神态。而且，Asuka 脸上似乎还留有泪痕？

Now completely baffled, Misato stealthily retreated to the kitchen where she withdrew a beer from the fridge and did her best to open it quietly, wincing slightly at the hiss that sounded as loud as an explosion in the silent apartment. She took a thoughtful swig, trying to fit all these puzzle pieces together. The problem was, all she had were edges that showed nothing but sky.
此刻彻底摸不着头脑的碓冰悄无声息地退到厨房，从冰箱中取出一瓶啤酒，小心翼翼地打开，那嘶嘶声在静谧的公寓中显得格外刺耳，她不由得微微皱眉。她沉思着喝了一口，试图将这些零碎的线索拼凑起来。然而，她手头的线索尽是些边缘信息，除了天空，别无他物。

Another sip of her beer didn't make things any more clear, and then her eyes landed on the answering machine. After one more mouthful, Misato set the can down next to the answering machine and covered the speaker with one hand to muffle the sound before pressing play.
再抿一口啤酒，思绪依旧纷乱，她的目光不经意间落在了电话答录机上。又咽下一口啤酒，碇真嗣将罐子搁在答录机旁，一手遮住扬声器以降低音量，随即按下了播放键。

"Katsuragi... it's me." Katsuragi... 是我。

A minute later, her arms shaking as she leaned over the bench, tears began to fall from Misato's eyes onto the traitorous machine.
片刻之后，Misato 俯身在长凳上，手臂颤抖，泪水不由自主地滴落在那台背叛的机器上。

### Chapter 42 I Miss That

"Have you fully recovered yet, Fuyutsuki?"
冬月，你已经完全康复了吗？

The old man, still feeling the strain of his abduction and incarceration, shook his head as he rotated his right arm. "My shoulder is still rather stiff, but I can manage."
那位老人，依旧感受到被绑架和监禁的余悸，摇了摇头，活动着右臂。“我的肩膀依旧僵硬，不过还能坚持。”

"Hrm. Agent Kaji will most likely be dead soon, if he has not already been intercepted." Gendo blinked once, slowly. Professionally, he would feel the loss of the triple agent a little bit, as Ryoji Kaji had done a good job of keeping SEELE distracted. But the foolish man had made his decision, and the Old Men would not take such an insult laying down.
"嗯。加治特工恐怕命不久矣，如果他尚未被截杀的话。"源堂缓缓地眨了眨眼。出于职业素养，他对失去这位三重间谍会有些许惋惜，毕竟加持良治成功地让 SEELE 分心了。然而，这个愚蠢之人已自寻死路，那些元老们绝不会容忍此等冒犯。

Fuyutsuki sighed philosophically. "A damned shame. I forgot to thank him."
副驾驶深沉地叹了口气：“真是可惜，我忘记向他道谢了。”

"Knowing the man, he would have likely refused any thanks. We will need to keep an eye on Katsuragi now. No doubt she will soon begin sniffing around. Do we know if he gave her any information?"
了解这个人，他多半会拒绝任何感谢。我们得盯紧桂了，她肯定很快就会开始四处探听。不知道他有没有透露什么信息给她？

"Nothing guaranteed, but I think we can safely assume he did." Fuyutsuki paused. "Are you sure you don't want her monitored?"
虽然不能保证，但我觉得可以合理推测他确实这么做了。" 冬月稍作停顿，又问："你真的确定不打算对她进行监视吗？

Gendo gave a slight shake of his head. "No. Katsuragi would not act while she knows she is being watched, and she will find information about the Old Men and their goals well before she discovers our true objective. She will direct her hatred against them, not us."
源渡微微摇头道：“不，葛城明知被监视，是不会轻举妄动的。她会先探明元老们的意图，才会发现我们的真正目的。她会将怒火对准他们，而非我们。”

Fuyutsuki nodded in agreement. "And... your son? Did he...?"
副校长点头表示赞同。“那...您的儿子呢？他...怎么样了？”

Gendo sighed, causing the half-finished paperwork on his desk to flutter. "He remembers what happened to Yui now."
源渡叹息一声，桌上未完成的文件轻轻飘动。"他现在记起了唯的遭遇。"

Fuyutsuki winced in sympathy. "But... he still doesn't know yet?"
冬月同情地皱眉道：“可是……他还没听说吗？”

"That... I cannot be sure of just yet. I believe the Second Child either knows or at least suspects, after her time absorbed into Unit-02's core. With how close the two of them are, she would not keep such a thing to herself. Therefore, he too knows or suspects."
那件事...我现在还无法确切断言。我推测第二适格者要么已经知情，要么至少心存疑虑，毕竟她曾与二号机的核心融为一体。考虑到他们之间的紧密关系，她不会对此保持沉默。所以，他应该也知道或至少有所察觉。

"...And when Shinji does eventually let slip that he knows?"
...而当真嗣最终不小心透露出他已知情时，又会怎样呢？

Gendo remained silent, turning the question over in his mind. Too many things were being kept hidden for the security of the scenario, even from his son, and it was currently impossible to predict how Shinji would behave if he found out. And now, of course, what he knew the Second Child would also know and vice versa. The question was... how would they react?
源渡沉默不语，心中反复琢磨这个问题。为了计划的安全，太多秘密被隐藏，连他儿子也不例外，眼下难以预料真嗣得知真相后的反应。如今，他所掌握的信息，第二适格者同样知晓，反之亦然。关键在于……他们将如何应对？

One way or another, though, neither of them would stand between him and reuniting with Yui.
不管怎样，他们都不会成为他重新与 Yui 团聚的障碍。

XXX

Something clattered on the floor of the kitchen, rudely awakening him. He raised his head, wincing as his neck protested at his unorthodox sleeping position. Slowly bringing a hand up to rub at the aching spot, his eyes glanced around the room, brain still in the process of waking up and determining what was going on. Weak light was shining in through a gap in the curtains, giving him a rough idea of the time. He stood up, only to be stopped by resistance on his left hand. He looked down, and saw the cause: she was still holding his hand. He couldn't remember if they had ever let go since yesterday.
厨房地板上突然传来一阵响动，将他从睡梦中猛然惊醒。他抬起头，因不寻常的睡姿而颈痛，不禁皱眉。他缓缓抬起手，揉着疼痛的地方，眼睛环顾四周，大脑还在逐渐清醒，试图弄清楚发生了什么。透过窗帘缝隙的微弱光线让他大致判断出时间。他正要起身，却被左手上的阻力阻止。他低头一看，发现原因：她仍然紧握着他的手。他记不清自昨天以来他们是否曾松开过。

Memories returned as his brain began to open doors to let them in. They had returned home yesterday, after... well, all of that, and then Rei had shown up at their door, and then...
随着大脑开始打开记忆之门，往事涌上心头。他们昨天才从那一切中归来，紧接着，零就出现在了家门口，之后...

Oh. Right. 哦，没错。

He looked down at her, his own expression shifting to match hers. Mister Kaji was... gone. How, he did not know, but she would certainly know the man better, and she was absolutely sure of it given the contents of that answering machine message. Who was he to try and say otherwise? To her of all people?
他俯视着她，脸上的表情也随着她的变化，与之一致。卡吉先生……已经不在了。他不清楚原因，但她无疑比他更了解那个男人，而且从那条答录机留言的内容来看，她对此深信不疑。他又有何资格去质疑她呢？尤其是对她这样的人？

With some regret he gently pulled his hand free, and quietly padded towards the kitchen. He paused after a few steps, glancing down at his left hand with a frown before looking back at Asuka. He searched his mind, looking for any sign of... her, and came up empty. Their synchronisation, constantly active ever since waking up yesterday, seemed to be... shut down? Disconnected? Could it be... restored? Did he actually want that? Did she?
带着一丝遗憾，他轻柔地抽回手，蹑手蹑脚地走向厨房。几步之后，他停了下来，皱眉低头看向自己的左手，随后又转头望向明日香。他在心中搜寻，试图捕捉到她的任何痕迹，却一无所获。自从昨天醒来后一直保持的同步状态，似乎被……切断了？还能重新连接吗？他真的希望这样吗？她又怎么想呢？

Well, Asuka did say... -or rather, believe- that it was useful and could only make them better at working together. All he could do for now was wait and see what happened. In the meantime...
正如明日香所言...或者说，她坚信...这确实有益，能让他们在协作中更上一层楼。眼下他只能静观其变，看看事态如何发展。在此期间...

Shinji turned around and walked into the kitchen... only to come to a stop yet again upon seeing what was there.
真嗣转身步入厨房，不料再次驻足，眼前的景象让他愣住了。

Numerous empty beer cans were strewn about the kitchen table. Some were laying on their side, their last dregs leaking onto the table's surface. One had fallen off the table, rolling and coming to a stop near the lounge room. And in the middle of the mess, slumped over the table asleep, was Misato.
厨房的桌子上散布着众多空啤酒罐，有的横卧着，残留的酒液滴落在桌面。其中一个罐子滚落桌下，一路滚到客厅才停住。在这片混乱之中，三佐趴在桌上沉睡。

Shinji sighed despondently as he took in the sight, slowly moving over to the table. He had expected Misato to take the news badly, but to drink herself into unconsciousness? An unwise sniff of the air made him dry heave, reflexively bringing up a hand to cover his mouth. His foot nudged something, and he looked down at it only to dry heave again. The rubbish bin was sitting next to Misato's chair, containing... stuff. Shinji swiftly retreated to the lounge room, before his stomach decided to add to the smell.
真嗣沮丧地叹了口气，缓缓走向桌子。他本以为美里听到消息会很难过，却没料到她会喝到昏迷。他无意中闻了闻空气，立刻干呕起来，本能地用手捂住嘴。脚边似乎碰到了什么，低头一看，又是一阵干呕。垃圾桶就在美里椅子旁，里面装着……那些不堪入目的东西。真嗣赶紧退回客厅，生怕自己的胃也跟着翻江倒海。

A blue head of hair rose up into his peripheral vision. Its owner let out a small yawn before shifting on the couch to face him. "Good morning, Shinji."
一缕蓝色的头发映入他的眼角。那人打了个小哈欠，随后在沙发上转过身来，面向他道：“早上好，真嗣。”

"Mor-urgh..." Shinji swallowed and tried again. "Morning, Rei. Did you... um, sleep alright?"
呃...早上好，绫波。你昨晚睡得还好吗？

"My neck feels rather sore, but I shall manage." Rei paused, tilting her head slightly as her eyes scanned him. "You look unwell."
我的脖子挺酸痛的，不过我能挺住。" Rei 顿了顿，头微倾，目光审视着他。"你看起来气色不佳。

"Oh no, I'm fine, it's just..." Shinji hooked a thumb over his shoulder at the kitchen. "It smells awful in there, that's all."
"哎呀，我没事，只是……" 真嗣回头指向厨房，"那里面气味太糟糕了，就这点事。

In fact, the stench was starting to reach into the lounge room as well. Rei sniffed the air and immediately wrinkled her nose. "...I understand," she quietly said. "I shall go and clean up the mess." She stood up, pausing just as Shinji did upon realising that she was holding Asuka's hand.
实际上，那股恶臭已经扩散到了客厅。Rei 闻了闻空气，随即皱起鼻子。“...我明白了，”她低声说，“我去把那堆东西清理掉。”她起身时，恰如 Shinji 之前那样，意识到自己正握着 Asuka 的手，便停了下来。

"It's fine! I can do it!" Shinji protested, even as his stomach voiced its objections. "I just... need a moment to get used to the smell."
没事的！我可以的！" 真嗣坚持说，尽管他的胃在抗议。"我只是...需要一会儿来适应这气味。

Both hands now free, Rei straightened up and gave him a serious look. "As Misato insists on telling me, this is my home. You are a guest, therefore such a chore falls to me." She glanced at Asuka. "Instead, perhaps you could wake Asuka up. After everything that has happened, she may wish to see your face first when she awakens."
双手得以解放，绫波丽挺直腰杆，神情严肃地望向他。“正如美里一再强调的，这里是我的家。你是客人，这类家务自然该由我承担。”她目光转向明日香。“不如你去叫醒明日香吧。经历了那么多，她或许希望醒来时第一眼看到的是你。”

Those words, from Rei of all people, brought a blush to Shinji's cheeks. He opened his mouth to insist that he could help, but the expression in those steely red eyes told him Rei would brook no opposition. He sighed in defeat and nodded, moving to sit back down on the couch next to Asuka.
那些话，竟是出自绫波之口，让真嗣的脸颊不禁泛红。他本想开口坚持自己能帮忙，但绫波那双坚定的红色眼眸中的神情分明表示不容反驳。他只好叹息一声，点头后坐回明日香旁边的沙发。

Rei headed to the kitchen, pausing only momentarily upon seeing what awaited her. "I see," she said in a voice like ice. "She has never been this excessive before."
丽走向厨房，见到眼前景象时稍作停顿。“原来如此，”她语气冰冷地说，“她以前从未这般过分。”

"Misato was closer to Kaji than any of us," Shinji clarified. "I'm fairly sure they were actually... you know, together."
Misato 和 Kaji 的关系比我们任何人都更亲密，" 碇真嗣澄清说，"我相当确定他们其实是...你懂的，一对儿。

"Hrm." Rei hummed, in that irritating way his own father habitually did. In all likelihood she had picked it up from the man, with as much time as she spent with him. "In that case I will certainly need Asuka awake, so that I may move Misato into her room."
嗯。" 丽哼了一声，那令人不快的样子和她父亲如出一辙，多半是受他影响，毕竟她与他相处甚久。"既然如此，我必须让明日香醒来，好把美里转移到她的房间。

"I can help with that," Shinji hastily replied, making to get from the couch.
"我来帮忙吧，" 真嗣急忙应答，随即从沙发上起身。

Only to be stopped by Rei's upraised hand. "No, you will not. I will most likely also need to change her shirt."
绫举起手制止了对方。“不，你不用。我多半也得给她换件衬衫。”

"...Oh!" Red returned to Shinji's face as he caught onto her meaning. "Um... yeah, alright, I'll wake her up."
...哦！" 真嗣的脸上再次泛起红晕，他明白了她的意图。"嗯...好吧，我来叫醒她。

"You just did," came a sleepy voice from right next to him. He turned his head to see two grumpy blue eyes staring at him. "What freaking time do you call this?"
你刚才不就那样做了吗，"一个带着睡意的声音从他身旁响起。他扭头一看，一双愠怒的蓝眼睛正盯着他。"这算什么鬼时间啊？

"It is just after oh-six-hundred," Rei immediately replied. "Could you please help me move Misato to bed?"
刚过六点，"绫立刻回应，"能麻烦你帮我把美里移到床上吗？

A sniff of the air apparently told Asuka everything she needed to know. She sighed and said, "Yeah alright, not the first time I've done this sort of thing."
显然，空气中微妙的气息已让明日香了然于胸。她轻叹一声，道：“行吧，这种事我也不是头一回经历了。”

The two girls went into the kitchen together, returning after a minute with Misato's arms slung over their shoulders. Shinji hastened to slide open the door to the bedroom and then get out of their way, closing it after them. It didn't take long for him to decide not to just wait around and, steeling his stomach as best he could, he headed into the kitchen.
两位女孩一同进入厨房，片刻后携着美里搭在肩上的手臂返回。真嗣迅速拉开卧室门，让出通道，待她们进入后便关上门。他很快便决定不再干等，鼓足勇气，迈向厨房。

When Rei and Asuka came out of Misato's bedroom a short time later, Shinji was putting the last of the empty beer cans into a trash bag. The air now smelled very strongly of lemon, but it was at least a scent that didn't turn the stomach.
不久后，绫波和明日香从美里的卧室走出，只见真嗣正将最后一罐空啤酒罐塞进垃圾袋。空气中弥漫着浓烈的柠檬香气，虽强烈却并不令人反感。

"I did say that I would clean up," Rei reproachfully stated.
"我确实说过我会打扫的，" Rei 带着责备的语气说道。

"You had something more important to deal with," Shinji countered. "I figured I may as well do something in the meantime."
你那时有更要紧的事，" 真嗣回应说，"我想着反正闲着也是闲着，不如做点什么。

"...Very well." Rei then excused herself and went into the bathroom.
"...非常好。" 随后，Rei 告辞一声，走进了浴室。

After tying up the trash bag and leaving it by the front door, Shinji turned around and recoiled in surprise; Asuka was standing directly behind him in the hallway. Rather than saying anything, however, she simply stared at him. Puzzled, he returned the gaze.
绑紧垃圾袋放在前门旁后，真嗣一转身，惊得倒退一步；明日香就站在他身后的走廊里，一言不发，只是静静地凝视着他。他满心疑惑，也回以同样的目光。

An awkward minute passed before Asuka rolled her eyes. "I guess that's broken then," she muttered, walking back into the kitchen. She stopped for a moment, glancing at the answering machine, before swiftly moving on to the lounge room. "It wasn't a bad dream," she quietly said as Shinji sat down next to her. "He's really gone..."
尴尬的一分钟后，明日香翻了个白眼，嘟囔着：“看来是坏了。”她走回厨房，途中停下瞥了眼电话答录机，随即快步进入客厅。真嗣坐到她身边时，她轻声说：“那不是梦，他真的离开了……”

No words came to Shinji's mind, so he did the next best thing he could think of. Slowly, hesitantly, he took hold of her hand, interlacing their fingers. Part of him expected their synchronisation to return upon the physical contact, but try as he might nothing seemed to change. Asuka looked down at where their hands met, then up at him. He gave her a weak smile; she didn't mirror it, but he felt a slight pressure on his hand that told him what she thought of the gesture.
真嗣脑子里一片空白，于是他做了当时能想到的最好的事。他缓缓地、有些迟疑地握住了她的手，手指交织在一起。他本以为身体接触会让他们重新同步，但无论怎么努力，似乎都没有任何变化。明日香低头看着他们交握的手，然后抬头看向他。他给了她一个无力的微笑；她没有回应，但他感觉到手上传来的轻微压力，告诉他她对这个举动的看法。

"I think... at this point," he said. "We can safely say that NERV can't be trusted anymore."
我想...到了这个地步，"他说，"我们可以断言，NERV 已经不再可信。

Asuka blinked a couple of times, before her face hardened into a scowl. "Yeah. I'll bet my status as pilot that Kaji was looking into them and got silenced. Damnit." She tore her gaze away. "We were going to ask him to try and help us out. Now what are we going to do?"
明日香眨了眨眼，脸上的表情逐渐凝重，眉头紧锁。“没错。我敢用我的驾驶员资格打赌，卡吉肯定是在调查他们时被灭口了。真该死。”她转开视线。“我们原本打算请他帮忙的。现在我们该怎么办？”

Shinji thought for a moment, then looked towards the bedroom door. "Maybe... Misato can help us?"
真嗣沉思片刻，目光转向卧室门。"也许... 美里能帮上忙？"

"Her?" Asuka scoffed, but then her expression turned thoughtful. "...Yeah, she might help. She's pretty high up in the chain of command, so I thought at first that perhaps she's in on what happened to our mothers too, but I'm pretty sure she would have let something slip by now."
"她？"明日香轻蔑地哼了一声，但随即陷入沉思。"...嗯，她或许能帮上忙。她在指挥体系中地位很高，我起初怀疑她可能也牵涉到我们母亲的事，但我相信如果真是这样，她早该露出破绽了。

Shinji nodded. "Misato and Mr. Kaji were very close. If he was looking into NERV, maybe he told her what he was doing? Just in case something like this happened?"
碇真嗣点头道：“葛城小姐和卡吉先生关系非同一般。如果卡吉先生真的在调查 NERV，他可能会向她透露自己的行动，以防不测。”

"A distinct possibility." Asuka's free hand began to rub her chin. "We can't exactly ask her right now though."
这确实是一个明确的可能性。" 明日香用空着的手摩挲着下巴，思索着。"不过，我们现在也没法直接向她求证。

"Speaking of which, maybe we should head back to our apartment for now," Shinji suggested.
"说到这里，我们或许应该先回公寓。" 真嗣提议说。

"Good idea. I need some coffee anyway, since we didn't get much sleep."
好主意。我正想喝点咖啡，毕竟我们没睡好。

Rei met them in the kitchen as they were heading out. "Will you be going to school today?" she asked, turning away from the sink with a glass of water in her hand.
丽在厨房碰见正要出门的他们，便问道：“今天去学校吗？”她边说边从水槽旁转身，手里还端着一杯水。

Asuka made a face. "After what we just went through? Hell no. I- we still need some time to sort out just what thehell happened."
明日香皱了皱眉头。"刚经历了那些事，怎么可能？我们还得花时间弄明白究竟出了什么岔子。"

Rei nodded. "That is understandable. I myself will be staying here to keep an eye on Misato."
丽点头道："我理解。我会留在这里，密切关注美里的情况。"

"Try and make sure she stays sleeping on her side," said Asuka. "The position we put her in, and the pillow we put behind her her back should suffice, but keep checking. If she vomits while still asleep, her skin gets cold, or if her breathing gets slow or shallow, call NERV."
尽量让她保持侧睡，"飞鸟提醒道。"我们调整的睡姿和垫在她背后的枕头应该能满足需求，不过还是要定时查看。一旦发现她在睡梦中呕吐，皮肤发凉，或者呼吸变得迟缓或微弱，立即联系 NERV。

A concerned look crossed Rei's face as Asuka gave her instructions. "Perhaps I should stay with her until she wakes up."
明日香下达指令时，绫波丽面露忧色，她思索道：“或许我该守在这里，等她醒来。”

"Wark." 发出鸣叫声。

The three teenagers turned to Pen-Pen's freezer. The penguin, seemingly having just woken up, yawned and pointed a clawed flipper at himself before pointing towards Misato's bedroom.
三个少年转向了企鹅企鹅的冰箱。那只企鹅似乎刚睡醒，打了个哈欠，用带爪的鳍先指了指自己，随后指向了美里小姐的卧室。

"You wish to stay with her instead, Pen-Pen?" asked Rei.
"你想留下来陪她吗，Pen-Pen？" 丽问道。

Pen-Pen nodded emphatically, then gestured towards the glass of water in her hand. Rei gave it to him and he began to waddle over to the bedroom door.
企鹅用力地点了点头，随后指向手中的那杯水。丽将水递给他，他便摇摇晃晃地朝卧室门走去。

"...Well I guess that solves that," Asuka remarked.
"...嗯，看来这问题算是解决了，" 明日香评论道。

Rei remained looking in the direction Pen-Pen had left. "Indeed. I will bring him breakfast after I have had mine. As for the two of you, please feel free to return whenever you wish. As Misato often says, our home is your home."
丽依旧凝视着企鹅彭彭离去的方向。“没错。我吃完自己的早餐后，会给他送去。至于你们俩，随时欢迎回来。正如美里常说的，我们的家就是你们的家。”

Asuka nodded. "Sure thing."
明日香点头说：“没问题。”

Shinji did so too. "Goodbye for now, Rei."
真嗣也这么做了。“暂别了，绫波。”

The second they were back in their own apartment, Asuka practically ran over to the coffee machine to turn it on while Shinji took a detour into the bathroom. When he returned to the kitchen, two steaming cups of coffee were sitting on the table on opposite sides. Fairly sure he knew what was to come, he took his seat and looked across the table at Asuka.
刚踏进自家公寓，明日香便急忙奔向咖啡机，迅速将其启动，而真嗣则顺路去了趟洗手间。待他回到厨房，桌上已摆好两杯热腾腾的咖啡，彼此相对。真嗣心中有数，便坐下身来，隔桌望向明日香。

Who then opened her mouth and said four words that, according to what he had heard in school, any male should dread to hear.
接着，她开口说了四个字，据他在学校所知，任何男性听了都该心生畏惧。

"We need to talk." 我们得谈谈。

Shinji sighed into his cup of coffee, blowing the steam away before taking a sip. "...Yeah, we do."
真嗣对着面前的咖啡轻叹一声，吹开蒸汽后轻啜一口，道：“……嗯，确实如此。”

Asuka slumped forward in her seat, letting the steam wafting off her own drink rise up directly into her face. "So. A whole lot of shit happened yesterday," she began, staring into the coffee. "We... saw what happened to each other when we were younger, for one thing. You got your memories of your mum back. My mum might have actually been fucking murdered..." She slammed a fist down on the table, then gingerly shook it. "And then we ended up perfectly synchronised."
明日香颓然前倾，任由自己杯中升腾的热气直扑面庞。“昨天真是糟透了，”她开口道，目光凝视着咖啡。“我们……看到了彼此年少时的情景。你找回了关于母亲的记忆。而我母亲，可能真的被谋杀了……”她猛地一拳砸在桌上，随后又小心翼翼地甩了甩手。“然后我们就完美同步了。”

"I think that was just about the only nice thing of that whole day," Shinji mumbled. He blinked, realising he'd just said that out loud, and his face heated up.
"我想那可能是那天唯一值得高兴的事，" 真嗣低声说道。他眨了眨眼，意识到自己无意中把心里话说了出来，脸上顿时泛起红晕。

Asuka cleared her throat in a not-at-all nervous manner. "Y-yeah. And now, Kaji is... dead. Where the hell do we even start?!"
明日香故作镇定地清了清嗓子。“对、对。可如今，加持他……已经不在了。我们究竟该从何着手？！”

That was a tricky question. What could the two of them even hope to accomplish? They were just two traumatised teenagers who went to school in between brief, violent battles against giant alien monsters in equally giant robots containing the souls of their mothers. They barely even had the security clearance necessary to walk around in the Evangelion cages. It wasn't like they could just walk up to Doctor Akagi or his father and demand an explanation.
那问题颇为棘手。他们俩又能期待达成什么？不过是两个心灵受创的少年，在短暂而激烈的巨型外星怪兽战斗间隙去学校，驾驶着寄宿着母亲灵魂的巨大机器人。他们连在福音机笼中自由行动的安全权限都微乎其微，更遑论直接向赤木博士或自己的父亲索要解释了。

Shinji took a deep, slow breath. Alright, forget about all the big stuff. What could they do right now? He at least had a thought there. Something that had been prodding him in the back of the head since he'd woken up.
真嗣深吸一口气，缓缓地。好吧，先抛开那些大事。眼下他们能做些什么呢？他至少有了点头绪。这个念头自醒来就一直在他脑海中若隐若现。

"Well, for starters... what are we to each other right now?"
那么，首先...我们现在对彼此来说是什么关系呢？

Asuka froze, staring at him wide-eyed for so long it seemed like her brain had short-circuited.
明日香愣住了，睁大双眼凝视着他，久久不能回神，仿佛大脑突然短路。

"...Asuka?" ...明日香？

As if coming out of a trance, Asuka blinked and roughly shook her head. "I... I don't know," she finally said. "I just. Don't. Know." She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table and putting her face in her hands.
仿佛刚从恍惚中回过神来，明日香眨了眨眼，用力地摇了摇头。“我……我真的不知道，”她终于开口，“我就是搞不清楚。”她身体前倾，手肘搁在桌上，双手掩面。

"I-"

"Stop," she interrupted. "Just... give me a minute to get my goddamn thoughts in order."
停一下，" 她插话道，"给我点时间，让我把乱糟糟的思绪理清楚。

Cut off before he could even begin to retract his question, Shinji sat and watched as Asuka frustratedly dug the heels of her hands into her eyes. After a few seconds of this, he sighed and reached across the table, grabbing both her wrists and pulling her hands away from her eyes.
真嗣的问题还没来得及收回就被打断了，他坐下来，看着明日香懊恼地用双手掌根揉着眼睛。过了几秒，他叹了口气，伸手越过桌子，握住她的手腕，轻轻将她的手从眼睛上移开。

"Asuka. Please, calm down," he said. "If you're not sure either... then just say so."
Asuka，冷静点，"他说。"如果你也不确定，直说就好。

"...Either?" echoed Asuka. She stared at him bemusedly. "So you're saying you don't know what we are to each other, and were hoping I could give you the answer?"
‘...还是这样？’飞鸟重复着，一脸困惑地看着他。‘你的意思是，你不清楚我们彼此间的关系，指望我来告诉你答案？’

His eyes darted away in embarrassment. "Y-yeah," he mumbled, letting go of her wrists.
他尴尬地移开目光，含糊地应了一声："嗯，是的。" 随即松开了她的手腕。

"Well, I hate to say this," Asuka paused to take a long sip of her coffee, "but I have no goddamn idea."
说实话，我真不想这么说，" 明日香顿了顿，喝了一大口咖啡，"可我确实一无所知。

Shinji chuckled weakly. "I... guess our relationship even before yesterday hasn't exactly been normal, has it?"
真嗣无力地笑了笑。“看来，即使昨天之前，我们的关系也挺不寻常的，不是吗？”

"You're telling me," Asuka muttered, taking another drink. "It'd be so much easier if we still had that synchronisation. I'm... missing it already," she added in a much quieter voice.
"你这是在跟我说吗？" 明日香低声嘀咕，又抿了一口。"要是我们还能保持那种同步，事情就轻松多了。我已经开始想念那种感觉了，" 她轻声细语地补充道。

"...You too, huh?" ...你也是这样啊？

Her gaze, slowly dipping downward as her mood did the same, suddenly shot back up.
她的目光随着情绪的低落而缓缓下垂，却又突然猛地抬了起来。

"It's... weird," said Shinji, staring at nothing. "We were only synchronised for a few hours, really. We've known each other for far longer than that. And yet..."
真是...奇怪，" 碇真嗣说着，眼神空洞。"我们其实只同步了几个小时而已。我们相识的时间远不止这些。但不知为何...

"When we were synchronised, I felt... comfortable," Asuka whispered. "I mean, I thought I was comfortable around you already, but yesterday..."
同步时，我感到...异常舒适，"明日香轻声道。"本以为在您身边已足够自在，然而昨天...

"We hugged shortly after waking up," Shinji continued. "But when we let go physically, it still felt like we were holding each other."
我们醒来后不久便拥抱了，" 真嗣接着说。"即便身体分开，仍感觉彼此依偎。

"I felt... it was like... even when we weren't in the same room. It was like you were right there with me."
我感觉到...仿佛...即便我们身处不同的房间，也如同你就在我身旁。

"Like no matter what came our way, we could face it head on. Together."
无论遇到什么困难，我们都能携手并肩，共同面对。

"I miss that." 我怀念那个。

"I miss that." 我怀念那个。

They were now staring at each other, perfectly still.
此刻，他们静静地对视着，纹丝不动。

"Do you... do you think we can do that again?" Shinji asked nervously. "Without an Angel causing it, I mean?"
你...你觉得我们还能再那样做一次吗？" 真嗣紧张地问道，"我是说，在没有使徒干扰的情况下。

"...I don't know." Asuka broke eye contact, draining most of her cup in one gulp then tilting her head back and finishing the rest off. The empty cup smacked down on the table. "How the hell would we even begin to attempt it? I mean, there are those times where we just... do things at the same time, but this is different."
...我真的不知道。" 明日香避开目光，猛地灌下大半杯饮料，仰头将剩余的一饮而尽，空杯重重地落在桌上。"我们究竟该如何开始尝试呢？我是说，尽管有时我们会不约而同地行动，但这次情况不同。

Shinji finished off his coffee and stood up, collecting their cups and taking them over to the sink to rinse out. "Maybe it will just come back," he suggested upon turning around. "There's still sync tests and simulation training waiting for us in the future, and we're pretty much always synchronised during them."
真嗣喝完咖啡，起身收拾了杯子，走到水槽边冲洗。他转过身，提议说：“或许它会自然恢复。我们未来还有同步测试和模拟训练，在那些时刻我们通常都是同步的。”

"Yeah... I suppose." Asuka slowly stood up, pushing her chair back under the table and taking a few steps towards the lounge room. Shinji began to follow her, only to halt as she suddenly stopped and turned around. "Hey... Shinji?"
嗯...应该是吧。" 明日香慢慢站起来，把椅子推回桌子下面，朝客厅走了几步。真嗣跟在她后面，但见她突然停下并转过身来，他也止住了脚步。"喂...真嗣？

"What is it?" 这是什么东西？

"I'm... sorry for leaving you hanging like this yet again," Asuka hesitantly said. "You've been waiting so long for me to give you a proper answer, but I still can't do it."
我...真的很抱歉，又让你这样悬着心，" 明日香迟疑地说。"你等我给你一个确切的答复已经很久了，可我还是给不了。

"An answer? To-...oh." Shinji waved his hands in front of him. "No, Asuka, don't apologise."
答案吗？到...哦。" 真嗣在面前摆了摆手。 "不，明日香，你不用道歉。

"Too freaking bad, I just did." She looked away for a moment, then back at him. "I can't remember if I've said this recently, but I'm really glad we're friends. No matter what happens, we'll still have that, right?"
真糟糕，我刚做了。" 她短暂地移开视线，随即又看向他。"我不确定最近是否提过，但我真的很庆幸我们是朋友。无论未来如何，这份友谊都会长存，对吧？

Shinji nodded emphatically. "Of course."
碇真嗣坚定地点头道：“当然。”

"Good." 很好。

Asuka looked away again and began to shift her weight from one foot to the other, while her right hand rubbed at her left shoulder. Just as Shinji was about to ask if there was something wrong, she stepped up closer to him.
明日香再次别开目光，身体重心在两脚间来回移动，右手不自觉地揉着左肩。真嗣正要开口询问是否有什么不妥，她却已迈步贴近了他。

"Asuka, wh-" Asuka, 怎么-

And put her arms around him.
她伸出双臂，紧紧抱住了他。

"...Ah." ...啊。

He felt somewhat shameful for freezing at the sudden contact, but after a few seconds he managed to bring his arms up to return the hug. Asuka let out a little hum, closed her eyes, and rested her chin on his shoulder.
他因突如其来的接触而愣住，感到一丝羞愧，但几秒后还是抬起手臂回以拥抱。明日香轻声哼唱，闭上双眼，将下巴轻放在他的肩头。

XXX

Her skull felt like it had just contained the entirety of an N2 mine detonation.
她的头骨仿佛刚承受了一枚 N2 地雷的全部爆炸冲击。

Her body felt like she'd been stepped on by an Angel.
她感觉身体仿佛被天使踏过一般。

Her hair hurt. 她感到头发疼痛。

Her fucking. Hair. Hurt. 她那令人恼火的头发，疼得厉害。

About the only thing she could feel that wasn't pain was a small warm body pressed up against her belly, but even now it was starting to move away.
她唯一能感受到的不是痛苦的，是一个紧贴腹部的小小温暖身体，然而此刻它也开始缓缓移开。

With a groan that sounded like an ancient dinosaur coming back to life, coincidentally exactly how she herself felt, Misato slowly pushed herself up, staring blearily at the nearby wall of her bedroom as she leaned on her elbow, body already tired from the exertion.
随着一声宛如古老恐龙苏醒般的呻吟，恰如其分地映射出她此刻的感受，Misato 缓缓起身，睡眼朦胧地凝视着卧室的墙壁，肘部支撑着身体，因用力而感到疲惫。

...She didn't remember going to bed. Again.
...她又忘了自己是怎么上床睡觉的。

"Wark." 发出鸣叫声。

At a glacial pace, she turned her head to the side, seeing her faithful penguin companion standing next to her bed. Realising he had been that small island of comfort in a sea of agony, she tried to say his name but her mouth and tongue, which tasted like the inside of a dumpster and probably smelled just as fragrant, refused to obey.
她缓缓转过头，发现忠实的企鹅伙伴正站在床边。意识到他一直是自己痛苦海洋中那片小小的慰藉，她试图呼唤他的名字，然而，她那感觉如同垃圾桶内壁般干涩的口腔和舌头，却无法听从指挥。

Seemingly understanding her plight, probably due to every other goddamn time she had drank herself to sleep, Pen-pen moved out of her range of vision, returning a few seconds later with a glass of water which he held out to her. She tried to lift up her free hand to grasp it, but a loss of balance resulted in her head returning to the pillow.
似乎是理解了她的窘境，或许是因为每次她都喝得烂醉如泥才入睡，Pen-pen 从她的视线中悄然离开，片刻后带着一杯水回来，递到她面前。她试图抬起另一只手去接，却因失衡而让头再次落回枕上。

"Wark..." 鸣叫声...

Pen-pen looked down at her, sadness evident on his face despite being a completely different species. With great effort Misato rose up, this time managing to get as far as sitting upright despite the clanging in her head.
企鹅潘潘俯视着她，尽管物种不同，悲伤之情却溢于言表。米萨托努力起身，这次总算坐了起来，尽管头昏脑涨。

At that point, just to make things worse, something nearby chose that as the perfect time to explode. Uncoordinated as she was, Misato still managed to clap her hands over her ears to ward off the worst of the noise. Which of course ended with her head back on the pillow yet again. Wincing in pain, she looked at the source of the noise. Rei was standing at the entrance to her bedroom, one hand on the door she had just slid open, and the other raised to her mouth in surprise.
就在这节骨眼上，偏偏附近某物选择此时爆炸，让局面雪上加霜。Misato 虽然动作笨拙，却还是及时捂住耳朵，试图减轻那震耳欲聋的声响。不出所料，她的头又一次重重地砸回枕头上。她痛苦地皱眉，望向噪音的源头。只见 Rei 站在卧室门口，一手扶着刚滑开的门，另一手捂在嘴边，满脸惊讶。

"My apologies, Misato," she whispered.
"抱歉，美里，"她轻声道。

At least, it was probably intended to be a whisper, but right now Misato would swear she could hear the Earth spinning like a jet engine beneath them. She unsteadily waved a hand at the girl, trying to signal with an uncooperative arm that it was alright.
至少，这原本应是轻声细语，然而此刻，美里几乎能感觉到地球在脚下如喷气发动机般轰鸣旋转。她艰难地挥动着手臂，试图向女孩传达一切无恙的信号。

Rei gently stepped further into the room, placing her feet in such a way as to make as little noise as possible. While Misato tried to smile at the girl's efforts, it was essentially meaningless because everything was too goddamn loud.
丽轻手轻脚地深入房间，小心翼翼地落脚，力求不发出声响。美里虽对她的努力报以微笑，但这微笑实则无济于事，因为周遭的噪音实在太过喧嚣。

Rei knelt down on the floor next to Misato, putting a hand on her back to help keep her steady. Pen-pen offered up the glass of water and, with her own arms no longer needing to try and hold her up, Misato took the glass with one hand while patting the penguin's head with another.
丽跪在美里身旁的地板上，一手扶着她的背，助其稳住身形。企鹅 Pen-pen 递来一杯水，美里此时无需再用双臂支撑，便一手接过水杯，另一手轻抚企鹅的脑袋。

"'nks, Pen-pen," Misato slurred, focusing carefully on the movement of her arm as she brought the glass to her mouth and took a sip. Despite being plain, room temperature tap water, it tasted like the nectar of gods. After managing to swallow a few mouthfuls, and now that her hangover had settled down slightly, she asked of Rei, "What's the time?"
谢谢，小笔，" 米萨托醉意朦胧地说着，她小心翼翼地抬起手臂，将杯子送到唇边，轻啜一口。那明明只是普通的室温自来水，此刻却仿佛成了天赐甘露。几口下肚，宿醉感稍有减轻，她便向丽问道："现在是什么时候了？

"It is currently eleven-fifty-five," Rei said, her voice still low.
"现在正是十一点五十五分，" 蕾低声说道。

"Uuuugh." She had to be back at work in three hours. NERV never slept and, a lot of the time, seemed to expect the same of the people that worked there.
"唉……"她再过三小时就得回 NERV 上班了。这个组织从不打烊，常常让人觉得它也期待员工们能如此。

"Go and take a shower," Rei said, absolutely not giving an order to her superior officer. "Asuka and Shinji prepared some breakfast for you, so I will heat it up while you are in the bathroom."
去洗个澡吧，" 丽说道，并非对上级军官下达命令。"明日香和真嗣已经为你准备了早餐，你洗澡时我会帮你热好。

"...How is Asuka doing, first of all?" Misato asked after a moment of thought. "I... saw you three on my couch when I got home."
首先，明日香情况如何？" 葛城美里沉思片刻后问道。"我... 回家时发现你们三个正坐在我的沙发上。

"Asuka is..." Rei hesitated. "She is a bit better now I believe. I brought the two of them here to listen to the answering machine message and Asuka..."
Asuka 现在... Rei 有些迟疑地说：“我觉得她现在状况有所好转。我带他们俩来听留言机的消息，然后 Asuka...”

"Yeah," said Misato, understanding completely. "Kaji was my replacement as Asuka's guardian. She was rather infatuated with him for quite a while." She chuckled softly. "Thankfully, then she met Shinji face to face and directed her... attention his way. But still, he was practically a surrogate father to her. I'm guessing you and Shinji ended up falling asleep while comforting her?"
嗯，" 碇真嗣完全理解地说。"加持良治曾接替我成为明日香的监护人，她曾对他颇为倾心。" 她轻声笑了笑。"幸好，后来她与真嗣相遇，便将注意力转向了他。不过，他几乎就像是她的养父。我猜你们在安慰她时，最后都睡着了吧？

Rei nodded. "It was Shinji's idea. He brought her over to the couch, and asked me to join them. I did not intend to fall asleep there, but..." She glanced at her hand, opening and closing it a few times. From what Misato remembered of the scene, Asuka had probably been holding on rather tightly. "Asuka was rather insistent."
绫波点了点头。“是真嗣的主意。他把明日香带到沙发上，还叫我一起过去。我本来没打算在那里睡着的，可是……”她看了看自己的手，反复地张开又合上。从美里回忆的情景来看，明日香当时应该是抓得很紧。“明日香非常坚持。”

"I can imagine. That girl almost never half-asses things." Finishing off the glass of water, Misato passed it back to Pen-pen and gave him another pat as she unsteadily got to her feet. Her head throbbed with every step she took but she pressed on towards the bathroom. "Well. Shower time I guess."
我能理解。那女孩做事从不半途而废。" 喝光杯中水后，葛城美里将杯子还给企鹅，又轻拍了它一下，随后摇摇晃晃地起身。每迈一步，头痛便加剧，但她仍坚持走向浴室。"嗯，该洗澡了。

Never had taking a shower felt so good. Misato actually felt almost normal as she dried herself off. She left the bathroom, dropped the towel on the floor of her bedroom, and quickly got dressed in a fresh set of clothes. Upon returning to the kitchen, where she could smell something delicious, her feet automatically sent her towards the fridge where her arm, also on autopilot, pulled out the sliding section.
从未有过一次淋浴感觉如此美妙。Misato 擦干身体时，几乎感觉自己恢复了正常。她离开浴室，将毛巾随手扔在卧室地板上，迅速换上一套干净的衣服。回到厨房，闻到一股诱人的香味，她的双脚不由自主地走向冰箱，手臂也像自动驾驶一样拉出了滑动部分。

...There was a lot more empty space than she remembered. Misato blinked slowly, her hands itching to grab one of those cans and crack it open. She growled, slamming the fridge closed and clenching her fists.
...冰箱里的空旷远超她的记忆。美里缓缓眨了眨眼，双手不由自主地想要抓起一罐饮料打开。她低声咆哮，猛地关上冰箱门，紧握拳头。

Rei, startled by the noise, turned away from where she had almost finished heating up the food. "Is everything alright, Misato?" she concernedly asked.
丽被突如其来的声响吓了一跳，从她即将加热完毕的食物前转过身，关切地询问：“美里，没事吧？”

"No, it's... I'm fine, Rei," Misato replied with a sigh. "Just... can you please do me a favour?"
不，其实...我挺好的，绫波，" 葛城叹息着说，"只是...你能帮我个小忙吗？

"Of course." 当然。

"When I'm gone, please..." Misato gave one last glance at the fridge. "Please get rid of every single alcoholic drink in this house. Empty them all down the sink and chuck them in a garbage bag. I'm..."
我走之后，请务必……" 碇真嗣再次凝视冰箱。"把家中所有酒类一扫而空。统统倒入水槽，装入垃圾袋丢弃。我……

Misato raised a hand to rub her forehead, trying to push the headache away. How many times had she come home and tried to drink all her worries away? Far, far too many. Kaji was gone now, killed by whoever he had been looking into. There wouldn't even be a body to bury, because NERV, or whoever was behind them, would have made sure of that. All she could do now was continue Kaji's mission in his stead. And the first step to take was to get the hell away from her goddamn crutch.
美里抬起手揉着额头，试图缓解头痛。她已经记不清有多少次回家后试图借酒消愁。如今，薰已离世，被他调查的那些人所害。连遗体都无法安葬，因为 NERV 或其背后的势力定会处理干净。她现在唯一能做的就是继续薰的使命，代他前行。第一步便是彻底摆脱那该死的拐杖。

"I can't be doing this anymore."
我实在不能再继续这样了。

XXX

An hour later, fresh and clean with a belly full of breakfast, Misato felt like herself once more. Before heading off to work, she took a detour next door to check on her other two wards, stopping outside their door with a hand raised to press the buzzer. She paused, thinking about the... relationship between Shinji and Asuka. While they certainly seemed about as close as it was possible for two people to be without getting horizontal, she just couldn't tell yet if they had taken that important step yet. On the other hand, with the eerie synchronisation the two of them had... did they even need to? Would they ever need to say a certain phrase to each other?
一小时后，吃饱喝足、神清气爽的葛城美里感觉自己又恢复了往日的状态。在去上班前，她特意绕道去了隔壁，想看看另外两个孩子的情况，停在他们的门前，手举起来准备按门铃。她停顿了一下，思考着...真嗣和明日香之间的关系。虽然他们看起来已经亲密无间，但还不能确定他们是否已经迈出了那关键的一步。另一方面，考虑到两人之间那种诡异的同步性...他们还需要说出口吗？他们还需要向对方说出那句话吗？

A sudden pang of grief struck her heart; she should have said that phrase to Kaji a long time ago. Instead she had done the stupid thing and ran away. With her own chance for happiness gone, all that was left for her was to do what she could to ensure a future for her wards.
突如其来的悲痛刺痛了她的心；她早该对加治说出那句话。可她却做了傻事，选择了逃避。随着自己追求幸福的机会逝去，她现在唯一能做的就是尽力为她的监护对象们确保一个未来。

The hand hovering near the buzzer retreated into her pocket to take out the keycard for Asuka and Shinji's apartment. Misato swiped it and stepped quietly into the apartment, listening carefully for any sign of her entry being noticed as she removed her shoes. The kitchen sounded empty, and there was no hint of the television being on, so she headed through to the doorway between the kitchen and lounge room.
手悬停在蜂鸣器旁，她随即把手伸进口袋，取出明日香和真嗣公寓的门卡。美里刷卡进入，轻手轻脚地脱下鞋子，同时留意是否有任何动静表明她的到来已被察觉。厨房一片寂静，电视也未开启，她便穿过厨房，走向客厅的入口。

The curtains were open, one of them billowing gently as a breeze came in through an open balcony door. On the other side, Misato could see Shinji sitting in a chair looking out at the city. As she drew closer to the door, she realised that Asuka was there as well, sitting on a cushion in front of him. Shinji's arms were moving, but from this angle Misato couldn't quite work out what was happening. She loudly opened the balcony door, but Shinji and Asuka barely budged at her sudden appearance.
窗帘敞开，其中一幅随着微风从敞开的阳台门飘入而轻轻摆动。Misato 望向另一侧，见 Shinji 坐在椅子上凝视着城市。当她走近门时，发现 Asuka 也在场，坐在他面前的垫子上。Shinji 的手臂似乎在动，但从她的角度看不真切。她大声推开阳台门，然而 Shinji 和 Asuka 对她的突然出现几乎无动于衷。

"...Hey kids," she said after a moment of awkward silence.
"...嘿，孩子们，" 她在一阵尴尬的沉默后开口说道。

"Hello, Misato," they both said at the same time.
"你好，Misato，"两人异口同声地说。

On perhaps any other day, she would have proceeded to tease them for their synchronisation. Now, though, she didn't want to do anything that could potentially upset the way they chose to cope with the loss of Kaji. Stepping out onto the balcony, she could finally see what was happening: Shinji was combing Asuka's hair. Such a... personal act, bordering on the romantic, was enough to give Misato pause just as she was about to speak. Shinji's eyes being closed as he ran the brush through Asuka's hair might have also had something to do with that.
若在往常，她或许会调侃他们步调一致。然而此刻，她不愿做出任何可能干扰他们应对卡吉离世的方式。她踏出阳台，终于看清了眼前的一幕：真嗣正为明日香梳理秀发。这般亲密，近乎情愫的举动，让美里在开口前不禁一怔。真嗣闭目梳理，或许也加深了这份感触。

Back in college, Misato had had her hair brushed by Ritsuko a few times while hungover; she knew what it was like when a brush stroke had caught on a tangle and Ritsuko had taken a moment to realise, since Ritsuko obviously couldn't feel the tangles like Misato could. Asuka and Shinji, on the other hand, were clearly putting their synchronisation to good use if the unchanging expression on Asuka's face was any indication.
大学时期，美里宿醉后曾几次让律子帮她梳头，她清楚记得梳子卡在发结时，律子需稍作停顿才能察觉，毕竟律子无法像美里那样感知到发结。至于明日香和真嗣，他们显然在同步率上运用得当，明日香脸上始终不变的表情便是明证。

After a couple of minutes, Shinji opened his eyes and set the brush on the table before turning his attention to Misato. At the same time Asuka stood up, grabbing the cushion and throwing it through the open balcony door into the lounge room.
几分钟后，真嗣睁开眼，把画笔搁在桌上，随即把目光转向美里。与此同时，明日香起身抓起垫子，从敞开的阳台门扔进了客厅。

"How are you feeling?" they both asked.
他们俩异口同声地问：“你感觉如何？”

"Alright, I suppose," Misato responded after a moment's hesitation. She had almost said something like 'pretty good', but it would be a long time before that would ever be true again. "You two?"
嗯，我想也是，" 三佐迟疑片刻后答道。她差点脱口而出"挺好的"，但那恐怕要很久以后才能再这么说了。"你们俩怎么样？

"...Coping. Somehow." Asuka's head drooped slightly. Shinji stood up and placed a hand on her shoulder. Then, somewhat surprisingly, Asuka spoke on her own. "Tell me you're going to find whoever's responsible."
...勉强应对着。" 明日香的头略微垂下。真嗣站起身，将手轻放在她的肩上。接着，出乎意料地，明日香主动说道："告诉我，你会揪出幕后真凶。

Misato's fists clenched. "Of course. I need to go to work soon, and I'll be trying to find out what I can inside NERV. It's going to take time, though. That place has a lot of secrets." She closed her eyes for a moment, recalling the crucified white giant in Terminal Dogma.
真嗣的拳头紧握。“当然，我很快得去上班，打算在 NERV 内部探查一番。不过这得花时间，那里秘密不少。”她闭目片刻，脑海中浮现出 Terminal Dogma 中被钉在十字架上的白色巨人。

When she opened her eyes, Shinji was shifting his weight slightly from side to side, his hand still on Asuka's shoulder. The two of them glanced at each other, and previous experience told Misato that some sort of communication was passing between them.
她睁开眼，只见真嗣正轻轻地左右挪动着身体，手还搭在明日香的肩上。两人目光交汇，凭着以往的经验，美里感觉到他们之间正进行着某种无声的沟通。

"We... we know that some of their secrets relate to us," said Shinji. "Something... really big."
我们...我们知道他们的一些秘密牵涉到我们，" 真嗣说道。"事情...非同小可。

"...What do you mean?" ...你指的是什么？

The two teenagers looked at each other again. Then, they did something that would have sent the Misato of a week ago scrambling for her camera. Shinji and Asuka hugged each other for a few seconds, then let go. A left hand clasped a right hand, and the two of them took a deep breath.
两位少年再次目光交汇。紧接着，他们做出了一周前的美里肯定会急忙抓起相机捕捉的举动。真嗣与明日香紧紧相拥片刻，随后松开。一只左手握住了右手，两人深深吸了一口气。

Misato was completely unprepared for what they told her.
美里对被告知的事情毫无准备。

### Chapter 43 Armisael

Rei sat in the kitchen and waited, staring at Misato's light through the walls of the apartment. She watched Misato's light briefly meet with Asuka, and most likely Shinji. She watched Misato's light slowly leave their apartment and proceed down the hallway to the elevator until the light faded from her vision. Only then, once there was no chance of Misato changing her mind and returning to stop her, did Rei get up and open the fridge.
绫波坐在厨房，透过公寓墙壁注视着美里房间的灯光。她目睹美里的灯光与明日香，或许还有真嗣，短暂交汇。随后，她看着那灯光缓缓移出公寓，沿着走廊向电梯方向行进，直至消失在视线之外。确认美里不会折返阻止她后，绫波这才起身打开了冰箱。

Yesterday, there had been just over two dozen cans of Yebisu beer in the fridge. Now, there were less than fifteen. Even considering that Misato normally drank beer like it was water, this was a dangerous amount to consume in one day. Liver damage was likely looming on the horizon.
昨天冰箱里还有二十多罐惠比寿啤酒，如今却不足十五罐。尽管 Misato 平时喝啤酒如饮水，但这样一天内消耗如此之多，实在危险。肝脏损伤恐怕已近在咫尺。

...Except with Complementation looming so close, that was hardly going to be a concern. Of course, she was the only one in the building who actually knew what was coming. Still, she had been given a task by Misato, and she was going to do as she was asked.
...由于补完计划近在咫尺，这几乎不成问题。当然，她是楼内唯一知晓即将发生之事的人。尽管如此，她接受了碇真嗣的任务，定会依令行事。

Rei moved every single can of beer to the kitchen sink where she began to empty them out two at a time. The smell made her nose wrinkle, and a touch of curiosity led to her taking the smallest of sips from a can, which was immediately spat into the sink. How Misato could consume this foul liquid in such quantities was beyond her.
丽把每一罐啤酒都移到厨房水槽，开始两罐两罐地倒掉。那气味让她不禁皱眉，一丝好奇心驱使她从一罐中尝了一小口，立刻又吐进了水槽。她实在无法理解，三鹰怎么能喝下这么多如此难喝的东西。

When every single can was empty, Rei took the bag out of the trash bin and added the cans to it before tying it off. As she was putting her shoes on to go outside and dispose of the bag, her body was wracked by sudden shudders. The bag dropped to the ground, her arms shaking as she tried to wrap them around herself. Her bones felt like they had turned to ice, while her skin felt like it was burning.
每个罐子都空了之后，Rei 从垃圾桶中取出袋子，将空罐子放入其中并扎紧。就在她穿鞋准备外出丢弃袋子时，身体突然剧烈颤抖。袋子落地，她的双臂颤抖着试图环抱自己。骨头仿佛冰冻，皮肤却似火烧。

'This again...' '又是这个...'

These attacks came and went seemingly at random, but the time between each one was definitely shortening. Rei grit her teeth, her mind trying to focus on anything apart from the sensation of her body slowly falling apart.
这些攻击来去无踪，看似随机，但每次之间的间隔确实在缩短。零紧咬着牙，竭力将注意力从身体逐渐崩溃的感受中抽离。

As if the universe had heard her, there was a knock at the door. Rei glanced at it, taking several deep breaths to calm herself. She then picked up the rubbish bag and opened the door.
仿佛宇宙感应到了她的心声，敲门声突兀响起。Rei 望向门，深呼吸几次以稳定情绪。接着，她拎起垃圾袋，打开了门。

"Hello Rei," greeted Shinji.
"你好，丽，"真嗣问候道。

Already, she could feel the pain lessen slightly. "Hello Shinji."
此刻，她已感到疼痛有所缓解。“你好，真嗣。”

"Asuka and I are about to go for a walk to the supermarket to get a few things. Would you like to join us?"
Asuka 和我正打算去超市散步顺便买点东西，你要不要一起来？

"I do not believe this household needs anything at the moment," replied Rei.
Rei 回答说：'我认为这个家庭目前并不需要任何东西。'

"That doesn't really matter," said Asuka as she came out of their apartment and closed the door. "Could always just get a snack or a drink for yourself."
那其实无所谓，"飞鸟走出公寓并关上门时说道。"你随时可以弄点小吃或喝的。

Rei glanced down at the bag in her hand. Perhaps there was something she could get, in a sense.
瑞依低头凝视着手中的袋子，心想或许能从中得到些什么。

Her body rebelled, hot and cold clashing within her veins. A faint sensation of melting came and went. Her expression never changed; it wasn't worth worrying her fellow pilots with her daily ailments.
她的身体在反抗，热与冷在血管中激烈交锋。一阵微弱的融化感忽隐忽现。她的表情始终如一，不愿因自己的日常不适让同伴飞行员担忧。

"Very well," she said. "I shall join you."
很好，"她说。"我这就加入。

XXX

The sun was actually rather mild for once, merely warming the city instead of attempting to burn it to the ground. Paradoxically, the sun seemed to be reducing the sensation of her skin attempting to melt off her bones... which still felt like ice.
这次太阳出奇地温和，仅以暖意笼罩城市，而非炙烤。矛盾的是，阳光似乎在缓解她皮肤仿佛要融化的感觉，然而骨头依旧冰冷如故。

Rei kept all this hidden behind a stoic mask. Her friends and fellow pilots had asked her to join them, and she had no desire to dampen their day. Instead, she kept a surreptitious eye on the pair; for some reason, Asuka's light seemed brighter than usual, even thought it looked to be tinged with a slight shadow. She did not know what mental torture Shinji and Asuka had been forced to undergo while she had to endure the slow journey down to Terminal Dogma to retrieve the Lance; all she had heard was something about past memories.
绫波将这一切深藏于一副波澜不惊的面孔之下。她的朋友们和同为驾驶员的伙伴们曾邀请她一同参与，她并不愿破坏他们的兴致。因此，她暗自留意着那两人；不知何故，明日香的光芒似乎比往常更为夺目，尽管其中似乎掺杂了一抹阴霾。她不清楚真嗣和明日香在她不得不缓缓下至中央教条取回长枪的过程中，究竟承受了何种心灵上的煎熬；她所知的仅是与过往记忆有关。

The command centre had done their best to speed the elevator up, 'red lining it' as Lieutenant Aoba put it, but they were risking a repeat of the crane disaster that had almost claimed Shinji's life at Mount Asama on the way up.
指挥中心已竭尽所能地加快电梯速度，正如青叶中尉所言，“让它极限运转”，然而此举正冒着再次发生类似起重机事故的风险，那次事故在前往浅间山的途中险些夺走真嗣的生命。

Shinji and Asuka didn't appear to have actually been mentally damaged by the event, the shadow on Asuka's light notwithstanding. If anything, it had only pulled them tighter together. And if such a connection could be forged between two people so different from each other... was Complementation even necessary?
真嗣与明日香看似并未因那场事件而遭受心理创伤，尽管明日香的光辉中隐约可见阴影。反而，这让他们之间的关系更加紧密。既然两个截然不同的人都能如此紧密相连……互补性是否还有必要呢？

Rei banished that thought immediately. Her ultimate purpose was to bring about Complementation, not question it. That was why she had been created, after all. It did not matter how close she had gotten to the other pilots; all would become one in the end.
绫波立刻将那个念头抛诸脑后。她的最终使命是促成补完计划，而不是对其产生怀疑。毕竟，她就是为了这个目的而被创造的。无论她与那些驾驶员之间建立了多么深厚的联系，最终所有人都会合而为一。

"Today's the last day of the Christmas holidays," Asuka suddenly remarked, breaking Rei out of her thoughts. "Damn shame we have to go back to school tomorrow. We hardly got to enjoy the time off at all."
今天是圣诞假期的最后一天，" 明日香突然开口，打断了绫波的沉思。"真遗憾，明天就得返校了。我们几乎没怎么好好享受假期。

Shinji hummed in agreement. "We only got one day out with our friends, and even that got interrupted."
真嗣哼了一声，表示赞同。"我们难得有一天能和朋友出去，结果还被搅黄了。"

Rei didn't have much to say on the matter. School was... a distraction; something to occupy her time while she waited for the Angels to attack.
丽对此事没什么可说的。学校……不过是个干扰；在她等待天使们发起攻击时，用来消磨时间的存在。

The three teenagers reached the supermarket after a few more minutes of walking and headed in. Asuka grabbed a trolley, and as they proceeded through the aisles, mostly gathering staple food items, she would occasionally pick something up and look questioningly at Shinji, who would think for a moment and either nod or shake his head. Once they reached the snack aisle, however, Asuka stopped the looks.
三个少年步行几分钟后抵达超市，随即进入。明日香推着购物车，在通道间穿行，主要挑选主食时，她不时拿起商品，以询问的目光投向真嗣，真嗣则稍作思索，点头或摇头回应。但到了零食区，明日香便不再用眼神征询真嗣的意见。

They left the aisle with a surprising amount of snacks.
他们离开过道时，带走了数量惊人的零食。

Rei tried not to pay attention at the meat section, especially since she could feel her own skin trying to crawl away. She tried rubbing a hand along her arm when Asuka and Shinji weren't looking, but it didn't help. In fact, it started to feel like her hand was starting to sink into the flesh of her arm. She stopped, staring at the hand as she tried to make sense of it.
绫尽量避免看向肉类区，因为她能感觉到自己的皮肤仿佛要逃离一般。趁明日香和真嗣不注意，她尝试用手抚摸手臂，但无济于事。反而，她开始觉得自己的手仿佛要陷入手臂的肉中。她停下动作，凝视着那只手，试图理解这诡异的感觉。

"Everything okay, Wondergirl?"
一切都还好吗，神奇女孩？

Rei jumped a little, startled by Asuka's voice. Her head shot up, and she tried to wipe everything off her face once more. "Yes, I am fine. I just... thought I felt a loose hair on me," she lied.
丽被明日香的声音吓得一跳，猛地抬头，再次试图擦净脸上的痕迹。“我没事，只是……感觉有根头发松了。”她撒了个谎。

"Ugh, I hate that feeling," Asuka said with a roll of her eyes. "You try to wipe it away, but your skin still thinks something is there. Anyway, what was it you wanted to get?"
哎，真讨厌那种感觉，" 明日香说着，翻了个白眼。"你明明擦掉了，皮肤却还觉得有东西残留。对了，你刚才想拿什么来着？

Rei blinked, not understanding the question for a moment. "...Oh. Yes," she finally said. "I... believe Misato wanted some canned coffee."
丽眨了眨眼，一时没反应过来那个问题。“...哦，对，”她终于开口，“我想美里是想要点罐装咖啡。”

Shinji and Asuka frowned in puzzlement. "What for? We have a coffee machine," said Shinji.
真嗣和明日香面露疑惑，眉头紧锁。"要咖啡机干嘛？我们这儿有啊，"真嗣说道。

There didn't seem to be any reason to hide Misato's decision from them, so Rei told them about how Misato had asked her to get rid of all the beer. Their eyes opened wide in shock, and then understanding dawned on them.
看来没有必要对他们隐瞒碇真嗣的决定，于是绫波丽向他们透露了碇真嗣要求她清除所有啤酒的事情。他们震惊地瞪大了眼睛，随后渐渐明白了情况。

"After what she pulled last night, and how she likely woke up this morning, I think I can see what she wants to quit," said Asuka. "And I guess canned coffee could... try and fill that gap, I suppose?"
从她昨晚的行为和今早可能的状态来看，我能猜到她为何想要放弃。" Asuka 说道，"或许罐装咖啡能...尝试填补那份空缺吧。

"You can't really get much worse than beer in the morning to wake up," Shinji added. "Besides, with a can of coffee she doesn't have to change her habit that much. It'll just be a different brand of can she smacks against that table."
早上用啤酒醒神已经够糟糕了，不可能有更差的选择。" 真嗣接着说，"况且，她只需改喝一罐咖啡，无需改变太多习惯。只是把敲桌子的罐头换成另一种品牌罢了。

With that said, they headed to the aisle containing soft drinks, where a carton of BOSS coffee was wedged into a free spot in the trolley. After a moment's thought, Asuka put another one on top. Then, after another moment's thought, she picked up the second carton again.
言毕，他们前往摆放软饮的货架，一盒 BOSS 咖啡恰好挤进了购物车的一个空位。Asuka 略加思索，又往上放了一盒。随后，她再次沉思片刻，又将第二盒拿起。

"Whoops," she muttered, moving to place it back on the shelf. "Forgot we'd be walking back. There's a bit too much here for us to carry already, and we can't just take the trolley with us."
哎呀，" 她低声说着，将它重新放回架子。"忘了我们得步行回去。这里的东西已经够我们拿的了，总不能连手推车也一起带走。

Rei tilted her head to one side. "Why not?" she asked. "Would anybody attempt to stop us returning to the apartment building with a trolley?"
绫歪着头问：“有什么不可以的？”她接着问，“难道会有人阻止我们推着手推车回公寓楼吗？”

Asuka froze where she was crouched, blinking several times. She glanced at Shinji, a finger tapping absently on the carton. Shinji looked thoughtful for a moment, then shrugged.
明日香蹲在那里一动不动，眨了几下眼睛。她朝真嗣瞥了一眼，手指不经意地敲着纸盒。真嗣思索片刻后，随意地耸了耸肩。

"...Besides," continued Rei. "Have you forgotten that Section Two is always following us? They may be able to assist in helping us get our groceries home."
...而且，" 蕾接着说，"你是不是忘了第二部门的人一直在我们周围？他们或许能帮我们把买的东西带回家。

There was a pause, and then two hands came up to slap two foreheads. Two mouths uttered a German curse.
片刻沉默后，两人同时举手拍额，脱口而出一句德语的咒骂。

"Well then," said Asuka. "In that case, we may as well get more stuff. Anything else you can think of that Misato might want, Wondergirl? Something that she might need if she's quitting cold turkey?"
那么，"阿苏卡提议道，"既然这样，我们不如再多准备些东西。奇迹少女，你还能想到米萨托可能需要什么吗？如果她决定突然戒断，她可能会需要些什么？

"The only thing a supermarket would stock that could help is headache medication," said Rei. "Other symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may not be so easily remedied."
超市里唯一能提供的帮助就是头痛药，" Rei 说。"酒精戒断的其他症状可能就没那么容易解决了。

"...What kind of symptoms?" Shinji cautiously asked.
"……什么样的症状呢？" 真嗣小心翼翼地问道。

"Headaches, nausea, anxiety, excessive sweating, to name a few," Rei promptly replied. "Some people even experience hallucinations in very rare circumstances."
头痛、恶心、焦虑、大量出汗，这只是其中一部分症状，" Rei 迅速回应。"极个别情况下，还有人会出现幻觉。

Asuka and Shinji glanced at each other, then back to Rei. "We'll need to keep an eye on her while she's home," said Asuka.
明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神，随后目光又回到了绫波身上。“她在家的这段时间，我们得留心照看她。”明日香提醒道。

Rei nodded. "I will do my best to stay with Misato, but I believe if you two spend time with her as well, it will help her cope during withdr-"
绫点头说：“我会尽力与美里同在，但若你们二人也能抽空陪伴她，相信能助她更好地度过撤离期的难关。”

The ice in her bones turned to spikes and her skin began to run like molten lava. Rei tried to casually reach out a hand to lean on the trolley while her own body tried to fall apart, but missed and stumbled slightly. Her brain wanted to expand and crack her skull open while her internal organs decided to take this perfect moment to violently rearrange themselves. She felt something fling itself up her throat and clapped a hand over her mouth, clenching her jaw shut to try and prevent its escape. Stomach acid swept over her tongue, burning away at the inside of her mouth even as she swallowed it back down.
她骨中的冰化作尖刺，皮肤仿佛熔岩般流淌。Rei 本想随意伸手扶住手推车，身体却几近崩溃，手未触及，脚步已踉跄。大脑似欲膨胀撑裂头骨，内脏则趁机剧烈重组。喉间有物上涌，她急忙捂嘴，紧咬牙关以防其逃逸。胃酸涌上舌尖，灼烧口腔，她却强忍着将其咽下。

Outwardly, all that actually happened was her body shuddering for a couple of seconds as she reached for the trolley and covered her mouth... but it was directly in front of Shinji and Asuka.
表面上，她只是伸手去抓手推车并捂住嘴巴时，身体不由自主地颤抖了几秒钟，但这整个过程恰好被真嗣和明日香看在眼里。

"Rei! Are you alright?!" they both shouted in alarm.
"Rei！你没事吧？！" 两人惊慌失措地喊道。

"It... is nothing," Rei weakly replied, trying to get some saliva in her mouth to wash the rancid taste away. "I believe... I need to just go home and rest."
这...没什么，" 绫波丽无力地回应，努力分泌唾液以驱散嘴里的恶臭。"我觉得...我应该回家休息了。

"Rest nothing, you look like you're about to fall apart!" Asuka retorted, not knowing just how close her words were to the truth.
"你一点都没休息，看起来快要撑不住了！" 明日香反驳道，她并不知道自己的话离真相有多么接近。

Rei turned her head -why did it feel so heavy?- to look at her arm. What little colour her skin usually had was gone; it now looked almost bone-white. Her eyes moved slowly to take in the shocked expressions on the faces of her fellow pilots. "...I'm... I..."
绫波艰难地转过头——为何感觉如此沉重？——望向自己的手臂。原本就略显苍白的肌肤此刻更是毫无血色，近乎骸骨般的惨白。她缓缓地将视线移至其他驾驶员脸上那震惊的表情。“我……我……”

Her legs disappeared. That was the only explanation for why she almost fell face-first into the side of the trolley. Shinji, being the closest to Rei, quickly reached out to try and keep her upright, just barely catching her before her head hit the ground.
她的双腿突然不见了。这唯一能解释她为何差点面朝下摔在手推车旁。真嗣离绫波最近，他迅速伸手扶住她，千钧一发之际阻止了她的头部撞地。

Asuka cursed, her words sounding like she was on the other side of a thick pane of glass. She said something else that Shinji replied to as he lifted Rei up. The two of them abandoned the trolley and ran to the front of the store, Asuka waving her arms and shouting to get people to move out of the way. Everything was starting to go dark, even as they made it outside into direct sunlight. The sun, enraged at the mere existence of Rei Ayanami, threw a boiling hot spear that pierced her head.
明日香咒骂着，声音仿佛隔着一层厚玻璃传来。她又说了些什么，真嗣回应着，同时抱起了绫波。两人丢下推车，冲向商店前部，明日香挥舞双臂，大声呼喊，催促人们让路。即便他们已跑到阳光直射的外面，四周却开始暗淡下来。太阳，对绫波零的存在感到愤怒，投掷出一支滚烫的长矛，直刺她的头部。

The universe finally took pity on her, and let Rei slip into unconsciousness.
宇宙终于对她施以怜悯，让绫波沉入了无意识之中。

"What the hell do you mean she's not here!?"
你这话什么意思，她怎么会不在这里！？

The poor nurse on duty at the reception desk, faced with the out-of-control wildfire that was Asuka Langley-Soryu, leaned back in her chair as far as she could. "I-I'm sorry!" she said. "All I can tell you is that Rei Ayanami did not get brought here."
接待台值班的护士面对如野火般失控的明日香·兰格雷，尽力将身体后仰。“真的很抱歉！”她回应道，“我只能告诉你，绫波丽并未被送来这里。”

"Then where is she?!" 那她现在在哪里呢?

"That's... on a need to know basis and I haven't been told..."
那是...基于必要知情原则，我尚未得到通知...

Shinji was trying to do what he could to try and subtly calm Asuka down, but he wasn't doing much better himself. Rei had been brought to NERV, where she had been immediately loaded onto a gurney and sent away, while he and Asuka had to deal with questions from Doctor Akagi about what had happened. The problem was that they had no idea beyond Rei suddenly not looking well and then collapsing. By the time Doctor Akagi had let them go and ran off, it was too late to follow Rei and now she had apparently vanished.
真嗣正努力以微妙的方式安抚明日香，然而他自己也心神不宁。绫波被紧急送往 NERV，随即被抬上担架送走，留下他和明日香应对赤木博士关于事件的连番质询。他们所知甚少，仅限于绫波突然显得不适继而倒地。待赤木博士结束询问匆忙离去时，已错失追踪绫波的时机，如今她仿佛人间蒸发。

Leaving the poor nurse to return to her duties, Asuka turned to Shinji and roughly palmed her face. "Well what the hell do we do now?" she asked.
让那位可怜的护士回去继续她的工作，明日香转向真嗣，不耐烦地用手捂住脸。“那我们现在到底该怎么办？”她焦急地问道。

Shinji thought for a moment, and an answer quickly came to mind. "We go find Misato. She's... what... fourth in command around here? Surely she can find something out."
真嗣沉思片刻，心中迅速有了答案。"我们去找三佐。她在这里排名第四，肯定能打探到一些消息。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Yeah. Unlike us, who are just the pilots of eighty metre tall death machines that are the only things standing between humanity and destruction. We may as well be the goddamn janitors for all we get told."
明日香不屑地翻了翻白眼。“可不是嘛。不像我们，只是操控着八十米高的巨型机甲，这些机甲是人类免于灭亡的唯一防线。我们简直就像是被忽视的清洁工，啥信息都得不到。”

She stomped off, and Shinji was hot on her heels. Several long minutes of walking later, they arrived at Misato's office only to find that she wasn't there, which didn't help Asuka's mood in the slightest. Deciding to stay, just in case they had come along right as Misato had stepped out for a bathroom break or something, they ended up waiting for twenty minutes before the person they were looking for suddenly barged in.
她怒气冲冲地离开，真嗣紧跟其后。经过漫长的几分钟步行，他们抵达了美里的办公室，却不见其人，这丝毫未能缓解明日香的坏心情。他们决定留下，以防美里只是恰巧去了洗手间或其他地方，结果等了二十分钟，直到他们要找的人突然闯入。

"Oh, hi kids," said Misato, sounding slightly out of breath. "Sorry, I was... busy with some other things."
哦，孩子们，你们好，" 三佐喘着气说，"不好意思，我刚才... 有点事情在忙。

Shinji could have been imagining it, but there might have been a flash of guilt on Misato's face for a split second. As if she had being doing something she perhaps should not have. Which... couldn't have been much, considering her place in the chain of command.
真嗣或许只是错觉，但美里脸上似乎确实掠过了一瞬的愧疚。仿佛她做了些或许不该做的事。然而……鉴于她在指挥体系中的地位，应该也不是什么大不了的事。

Then again, she was looking into Kaji's death. His mysterious death, to be more precise.
她再次着手调查卡吉的死因，尤其是他那神秘莫测的死亡。

"Misato," said Asuka by way of greeting, getting straight to the point. "Rei got brought to NERV after she collapsed but she's not in the medical ward and nobody knows where she is."
美里，" 阿薩卡开门见山地打招呼，"丽昏倒后被送到了 NERV，但医疗区没有她，谁也不知道她现在在哪里。

Misato remained still for a moment, before swiftly bringing out her phone. She pressed a button on it and put it to her ear, whereupon she almost immediately groaned in frustration. "Pick up your damn phone, Rits," she muttered after trying two more times. It ended up taking another five attempts for the call to go through, and when it did Shinji and Asuka could easily hear Ritsuko incensed greeting.
碇真嗣和明日香清晰地听到了律子那充满怒气的招呼声。

"Misato, I am a little busy trying to save the life of a pilot here!"
Misato，我现在有点忙，正在努力救一名飞行员！

Misato swapped the phone to her other ear, bringing up her free hand to rub at the one Ritsuko had just attacked with a sonic weapon. "Look, Rits, I have two kids here that look like they want to jump in their Evas and tear the Geofront apart to look for their friend. At least give me something to tell them!"
美里将电话换到另一只耳朵，腾出手来揉了揉刚才被律子用声波武器攻击过的耳朵。"律子，我这儿有两个孩子，他们急得想跳进 Eva，把第三新东京市翻个遍去找他们的朋友。你至少得给我点消息安抚他们！"

"Where Ayanami is now, with me, is where she can be saved. But not if I'm getting distracted!"
绫波现在与我同在之处，正是她获救的希望所在。然而，一旦我分心，这希望便会破灭！

"Yes or no. Will she be alright?"
是还是不是？她会没事吧？

"It'll take some time, but yes, I can save her. Now let me actually do that!"
虽然需要点时间，但我确实能救她。现在，让我开始行动吧！

There was a loud noise that might have been a phone being thrown. Misato looked at her phone for a few seconds then sighed. "Well... you definitely heard her,' she said. "Rei will be alright."
一声巨响传来，可能是手机被摔了。Misato 瞥了一眼手机，随后叹了口气。“看来...你确实听到她了，”她低语道。“Rei 不会有事的。”

"But what happened?" Asuka pressed. "All we know is Rei started looking like she had the flu or something, then she collapsed!"
但是到底发生了什么？" 明日香紧追不舍地问，"我们只知道绫波开始显得像是得了流感之类的病，接着她就倒下了！

Misato sighed and put a hand to the side of her head. "I'm sorry, but I don't have anything I can tell you." Then, to the surprise of Shinji and Asuka, she winked the eye that was partially covered by her hand and mouthed the word 'yet'.
碇真嗣和明日香惊讶地发现，她眨了眨被手半遮的眼睛，并轻声吐出了“还没”二字。

The two teenagers glanced at each other, then back to Misato. Asuka threw up her hands and let them fall back to her sides. "Fine. Whatever. I guess as long as we know Rei's going to be alright, we can stop worrying then." She turned to Shinji. "Come on then. While we're at NERV we may as well go see Glasses. With the way things are around here they'll probably just throw him in an incinerator without letting us say goodbye."
两位少年相视一眼，随即目光又转向了美里。明日香举手又放下，无奈地说：“行吧，无所谓了。既然知道绫波会没事，我们也就放心了。”她转头对真嗣说：“走吧，既然来了 NERV，不如顺道去看看眼镜。这里乱成这样，他们可能直接把他送进焚化炉，连个告别的机会都不给。”

For a moment Misato looked as though she was about to retort, perhaps to try and defend NERV, but then she waved a hand and shook her head. "I get the feeling you might be 'asked' to stay here anyway," she said instead. "We're two pilots down and we have no idea when the next Angel will strike."
有那么一瞬，美里似乎要反驳，或许是为了维护 NERV，但她摆了摆手，摇摇头。“我预感你可能会被‘要求’留下来，”她转而说道。“我们缺了两名驾驶员，还不清楚下一个使徒何时会来。”

"Hell, it could even be right-"
天哪，这甚至可能是对的-

The sound of an alarm cut Asuka off. Three pairs of eyes widened in disbelief, and two heads turned towards the prophetic redhead who could only think of one thing to say.
警报声突然响起，打断了飞鸟的话。三双眼睛惊讶地瞪大，两人转头看向那位预言般的红发女子，她此刻脑海中只浮现出一句话。

"THAT WAS NOT A GODDAMN REQUEST!"
那绝不是请求，而是命令！

XXX

"The target is holding position above the north quadrant of the city."
目标正位于城市北部的上空。

"No sign of where it came from, it just... appeared above us!"
没有任何迹象显示它来自何方，它就这样...突然出现在我们头顶！

"MAGI are reporting Blood Pattern Orange- no, Blue-... Orange again..."
MAGI 报告的血迹模式先是橙色，然后变为蓝色，...最终又变回了橙色...

Misato frowned at that last report. "It's regularly alternating between blue and orange. What the hell does that mean?"
碇真嗣皱眉看着最后那份报告，问道："它总是在蓝色和橙色之间来回变换，这究竟意味着什么？"

Ritsuko was still busy wherever she was, trying to save Rei's life. The command centre felt strangely empty without her. Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki was in the customary spot above and behind Misato, but there was strangely no sign of Commander Ikari.
理子仍在忙碌，不遗余力地试图拯救绫波的生命。指挥中心因她的缺席而显得格外空荡。副司令冬月依旧站在美里后方的高台上，但令人诧异的是，司令碇源堂并未出现。

"I believe the alternating pattern means this Angel does not have one single form," said Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. "It may morph during the battle, perhaps similarly to the Fifth Angel?"
我认为这种交替出现的模式表明，这个使徒并非固定形态，"副司令冬月分析道，"它在战斗中可能会变形，或许与第五使徒的特性相似？

"Please don't tell me we're going to have another mountain melter," Aoba groaned.
"别告诉我，我们又要碰上山体融化了。"青叶不满地说。

On the holographic screen in front of the bridge crew, there was an image of what looked to be a double helix ring made of pure light. It was the size of a city block, placidly spinning in the air above Tokyo-3, and was seemingly content to just stay there instead of making an attempt to breach the city's defenses. The MAGI had assigned it the codename 'Armisael'.
舰桥前的全息屏幕上，映出的是一个由纯净光芒构成的双螺旋环状物，其规模堪比城市街区，正静静地在东京-3 上空旋转，仿佛满足于现状，无意突破城市的防御。MAGI 系统已赋予其代号“Armisael”。

"...Do you think it's waiting for us?" asked Makoto. "Maybe it knows it can't get down here on its own."
...你觉得它是在等我们吗？" 真琴问道。"可能它明白自己没法独自下来。

"Well unfortunately we can't just leave it there," said Misato. "And just because it hasn't done anything yet doesn't mean it isn't planning something."
唉，遗憾的是，我们不能就此置之不理，" 弥沙子说道。"虽然它现在还没动静，但这不代表它没有暗中谋划。

"Entry plug insertion complete," Aoba reported. "Beginning Unit-02 activation."
插入栓插入完毕，" 青叶报告说。"现在开始激活二号机。

Misato had floated the idea of sending out both Unit-02 and Unit-01, but it had been vetoed by Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. On the one hand, she agreed with the decision due to the simple fact that without an AT-Field, Shinji would not be able to effectively defend himself. On the other hand... this fight just felt like it was going to need more than one Evangelion.
碇真嗣曾提议同时出动二号机和初号机，然而副司令冬月否决了这一提议。从一方面看，她同意这个决定，因为如果没有 AT 力场，真嗣将难以有效防御。但从另一方面来看...这场战斗似乎需要不止一台 EVA 的参与。

Asuka's voice soon filled the command centre. "So what are we looking at topside?" Some button pressing from the bridge crew transferred the details to Unit-02's systems. "...A giant halo? Just great."
明日香的声音迅速充满了指挥中心。"那么，我们头顶上是什么情况？" 舰桥上的工作人员按下按钮，将详细信息传输到二号机的系统中。"...一个巨大的光环？真是太妙了。"

"And apparently it might be able to change forms too," Shinji added.
"而且看起来它似乎还能变换形态，" 真嗣补充说。

"It's going to be a tricky bastard, that's for sure," said Misato. "I'd put money on it being quick and agile, and you'll be going out there with no backup beyond what we can give you with the static defenses. Don't let yourselves get boxed in; make sure you've always got an exit strategy."
这东西肯定不好对付，我敢肯定它既快速又灵活，你们出去后除了我们能提供的静态防御外，没有其他支援。千万别让自己陷入绝境；务必确保随时都有撤退方案。

"Copy that," said Asuka and Shinji. "We'll beat this thing for Rei."
明白，" 阿苏卡和真嗣齐声道。"我们要为丽战胜它。

Misato nodded. "Damn right you-..." She paused, and frowned as a thought occurred. "This Angel appeared right as we're down a second pilot. That can't be a coincidence, surely."
碇真嗣点头道：“你说得对……”她突然停住，眉头紧锁，意识到一个问题。“这个使徒偏偏在我们缺了第二名驾驶员时出现，这绝非偶然。”

"Let me allay your fears there, Major," said Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. Misato turned to look up at him, leaning on the edge of the platform and gazing back down at her. "While I cannot give you details, Rei's situation is guaranteed to be in no way related to this Angel."
少校，我来为您消除疑虑，"副指挥官 Fuyutsuki 说道。Misato 转过身，仰头望向他，而他则倚在平台边，俯视着她。"尽管我无法详述，但可以肯定，Rei 的情况与这个使徒毫无关联。

Misato stared at her superior officer for a moment, quickly turning things over in her mind before remembering that this wasn't the time. "If you say so, sir," she said.
真嗣盯着她的上级军官凝视片刻，脑海中迅速思索一番，随即意识到此刻不宜多言。“既然您这么说，长官，”她应道。

Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki nodded. "Now then, are our two brave pilots ready?"
副指挥官冬月点头问道：“那么，我们两位勇敢的飞行员是否已经准备就绪？”

"Yes sir!" 好的，先生！

"Good. No need to delay further, Major. Give the order."
好的，少校，无需再拖延，请下达命令。

Misato turned back to the holographic screen, showing the Angel along with an image of her two wards. She took a deep breath.
葛城美里转身面向全息屏幕，屏幕上展示着使徒以及她两位守护者的影像。她深吸了一口气。

"Eva Unit-02, launch!" Eva Unit-02，启动！

XXX

This was going to be one of their toughest battles yet. With just a single Evangelion and whatever meagre support the weapon emplacements around the city could provide, they had to take down an enemy that was guaranteed to be more than it appeared. She was feeling confident in their abilities but he was rather wary. If the worst happened and they went down, there would be nobody to distract the Angel or get them to safety. The city's static defenses had been proven time and again to be essentially useless.
这将是他们迄今为止最严峻的挑战。仅靠一架福音战士及城市周边武器阵地的有限支援，他们必须击败一个看似简单实则强大的敌人。她对自己的能力信心满满，而他则持谨慎态度。万一他们失利，将无人能引开使徒或救助他们。城市的固定防御已被多次证实几乎无效。

...She believed that was rather pessimistic, and that he should at least wait until they reached the surface and could see the Angel face to face before writing them off.
...她觉得这种看法过于悲观，主张至少要等到他们回到地面，亲眼见到天使，再做判断。

...He was apologetic. ...他表达了歉意。

She smirked, and gave him the mental equivalent of a pat on the shoulder.
她微微一笑，仿佛在精神上拍了拍他的肩膀。

The launch catapult slammed into position on the surface, on the opposite side of the city to Armisael, and the restraints swiftly disengaged. Unit-02 quickly ducked sideways in case of an ambush, but no attack was forthcoming. Rising back to its full height, Unit-02 stared at the Angel, which didn't even seem to register the presence of the Evangelion.
发射弹射器在阿米萨尔城对面的地面上猛然就位，束缚装置随即迅速解开。二号机机敏地侧身躲避，以防遭遇伏击，然而并未受到攻击。恢复直立姿态后，二号机紧盯着使徒，而使徒似乎对福音战士的存在毫无察觉。

"...Strange. Does it not see you as a threat?" Misato wondered aloud.
"...真是奇怪。它难道不认为你是威胁吗？" 碇真嗣不禁自语。

"No changes detected in the target," said Lieutenant Hyuga.
中尉日向报告：'目标中未发现任何变化。'

Well in that case... she wasn't going to insist they dive in right away. If this Angel wanted to just sit around, that just meant more time for them to check it out and perhaps be able to make the first strike for once.
既然如此，她并不打算催促他们立即行动。如果这位天使选择静坐，那正好给他们更多时间来仔细观察，说不定这次能抢先一步发起攻势。

Unit-02 collected a Pallet Rifle from a nearby armoury building, keeping an eye on Armisael at all times; it continued to not respond even as a weapon was aimed at it. Unit-02 lowered its weapon and began to approach the Angel. As the gap between them closed, it became more obvious just how big Armisael was; its diameter was enough to comfortably fit two Evangelions end to end.
二号机从近旁的军械库中拾起一支货盘步枪，目光始终不离亚弥纱；即便被武器瞄准，亚弥纱依旧静默如初。二号机放下枪械，缓缓向使徒逼近。随着距离的缩短，亚弥纱那庞大的身躯愈发显得巍峨；其直径之大，足以让两台福音战士并排躺下仍有余裕。

They stared at the Angel as they brought Unit-02 to a halt. There was still no sign that the Angel had even noticed them. Unit-02 began to circle the Angel, minding to keep a tall building within dashing distance.
他们凝视着天使，同时让二号机停下。天使似乎依旧没有察觉到他们的存在。二号机开始围绕天使盘旋，留意保持与一栋高楼的冲刺距离。

"So what now?" she asked. "This thing still doesn't seem to know we exist."
那现在怎么办呢？"她问道，"这东西好像还不知道我们的存在。

"Well if it's giving us the chance to attack first, I say we take it," he replied.
"既然有机会先发制人，我觉得我们应该把握住，"他回应说。

"Good idea. First though, pull back to these coordinates."
好主意。不过，先退回到这些坐标位置。

XXX

Weak red eyes forced themselves open.
微弱的红眼睛吃力地睁开了。

She could sense the Angel on the surface, despite being this deep in Central Dogma. Or perhaps it was because she was this deep, and therefore closer to her true body.
尽管身处中央教条的深处，她仍能感知到天使的存在。或许正是因为深入至此，她才更接近自己的真实本体。

"No changes detected in the target," said Lieutenant Hyuga.
"目标未检测到任何变化，"日向中尉说道。

Doctor Akagi or Commander Ikari had opened a line of communication with the command centre in order to stay up to date on the situation while trying to keep this body in one piece. They were currently preoccupied with looking at a computer screen. Shinji and Asuka were out there, about to attack the Angel. She could sense what it was about to do. And she was too weak to help. She couldn't even stand on her own feet while immersed in LCL. A harness was being used to keep her upright in the tube, the straps digging uncomfortably into her flesh.
医生阿卡吉或指挥官碇司令已与指挥中心建立通讯，以便随时掌握局势，同时努力维持机体完整。他们正全神贯注地盯着电脑屏幕。真嗣和明日香正在外面对抗使徒。她能预感到使徒的下一步动作。然而她自己却虚弱无力，无法施以援手。她甚至无法在 LCL 中站稳，只能依靠安全带将自己固定在管道内，带子紧紧勒入肌肤，感觉十分不适。

Rei moaned in pain, but Doctor Akagi and Commander Ikari did not hear her. With what little strength remained, Rei lifted up an arm and knocked a fist against the glass separating her from them. For a brief moment, she worried that they had not heard her, but then Doctor Akagi's head lifted up and she glanced over.
绫波丽因痛苦而呻吟，然而赤木博士和碇司令并未察觉。她竭尽余力，举起手臂敲打分隔他们的玻璃。她曾担心他们未曾听见，但赤木博士很快抬起头，向这边投来目光。

"Rei?" Rei?

Commander Ikari's attention was pulled towards her as well. The two of them came closer to the tube, and Rei lifted her head to look at both of them.
伊卡里指挥官的目光同样被她吸引过去。两人靠近了那个圆柱形容器，绫波丽抬起头，目光投向了他们两人。

"...Help..." she whispered. "...Help..."
...救命..." 她低语道。"...救命...

"We're doing what we can, Rei," said Doctor Akagi, misunderstanding Rei's intentions.
"我们已经在尽力了，绫波，"阿卡吉博士说道，却误解了绫波的真正意图。

Even simple words were a struggle. "Not me. Them. Must..."
就连简单的词语也难以表达。“不是我，是他们。必须……”

"You don't think the Second and Third can handle this one?" asked Doctor Akagi.
"你难道不觉得第二和第三能够应对这个问题吗？"阿卡吉博士问道。

Rei could only shake her head a few millimetres each way. "Dangerous. I must..."
玲只能左右微摆头部。"太危险了。我必须……"

Commander Ikari's eyes widened slightly behind his glasses. "You want to go out there while you're like this?" he asked.
伊卡里指挥官透过眼镜，双眼微微睁大。“你打算就这样出去？”他问道。

Rei nodded as best as she could. "This body... replaced... They cannot."
瑞尽力点头，说道：“这具身体...已被替换...他们无法做到。”

"We can't restore this body now, Commander," said Doctor Akagi. "It's simply too far gone. We need to activate another one, but to do that..."
指挥官，这个机体已无法修复，损坏过于严重。我们必须启用备用机体，但启动它……

Commander Ikari's right hand moved to the left side of his jacket, where the bulge of a sidearm was barely concealed by the fabric. His hand hovered over it for several seconds, his eyes staring into Rei's, then fell back to his side. "I... I cannot do it," he admitted. "And even if I could, it would take too long to prepare the next one."
碇司令的手移向夹克左侧，那里藏着一把手枪，枪身在布料下隐约可见。他的手在上面停留了几秒，目光紧盯着绫波，随后又垂回身侧。“我……我做不到，”他承认道，“即便能做到，准备下一个也太耗时了。”

"Use. This body... Prepare new one."
利用这个身体...准备下一个。

Commander Ikari's eyes closed for a moment, then opened again. "...Very well. Ritsuko, prepare her to be moved to Unit-00. I'll fetch a plugsuit for her."
碇指挥官闭目片刻后睁开双眼，说道：“……好吧。律子，准备将她转移到零号机，我去取一套插入栓服给她。”

"No time... no suit." 没时间了...也没穿正装。

"Just the connectors then," Commander Ikari said, before heading off.
"就剩下连接器了，"指挥官伊卡里说完便离开了。

Doctor Akagi brought over the gurney that had delivered Rei down here. She initiated the draining sequence, sighing as she did so. "You're sure about this Angel, Rei?" she asked, before shaking her head. "What am I saying, of course you are."
医生阿卡吉推来了曾运送零号机下来的担架车。她启动排水程序时叹了口气。“你真的确定要这么做吗，零号机？”她问道，随即摇头自嘲，“我真是多此一问，你肯定已经决定了。”

Soon, Rei was back on the gurney, covered by a sheet, and being rushed through NERV. She gathered her strength for what was to come. This body would have to pilot one last time, even if she could no longer reach the controls.
不久，绫波丽又躺回了担架，身上盖着布单，在 NERV 内部被迅速推进。她凝聚力量，为即将到来的挑战做准备。这副身躯必须再驾驶一次，哪怕她已无法触碰到操纵杆。

"Hurry," she whispered to Doctor Akagi. "It's... coming..."
快点，"她轻声对赤木医生说，"它...就要来了...

XXX

"Copy. Moving to position."
复制内容。移动至指定位置。

Unit-02 began to back away slowly, heading towards the position marked by Misato.
二号机缓缓后退，向着碇真嗣所指示的位置移动。

"Something's happening!" 发生了什么事！

"What is it?!" 这是什么啊?!

Armisael halted its spin. Its double helix form became a single solid beam of light, and the circle split at the point nearest Unit-02 with one end beginning to weave around like a snake's head. The Evangelion brought its weapon up to fire, but the loose end began to swiftly slither through the air almost faster than their eyes could track. Unit-02 only got a single burst off from its weapon before it had to take evasive action. The Angel zoomed past them, zig-zagging around the buildings in a manner strangely similar to an old video game she had once played.
亚弥赛尔停止旋转，双螺旋形态凝聚成一道坚实光束，圆环在靠近贰号机处裂开，一端如蛇首般开始盘绕。贰号机举起武器欲射击，然而那松散的一端在空中迅捷游走，快得令人目不暇接。贰号机仅发出一串攻击便被迫躲避。使徒从旁掠过，在建筑间曲折穿梭，其动作与她曾玩过的某款老游戏颇为相似。

As usual, the Pallet Rifle seemed to have no effect on the Angel, even when they could hit its body as it narrowly missed them. Firing at the 'head' was pointless as it was simply too fast. Thankfully it didn't seem to have any intention of encircling them, instead opting for rapid strikes and quick retreats. It was all they could do to stay out of the way, and putting up an AT-Field only made Armisael rapidly veer off and come around to attack from another direction.
如同往常，Pallet Rifle 对天使似乎依旧无效，即便他们能险些击中其身躯。瞄准其“头部”毫无意义，因其速度过快。所幸它并无意包围他们，而是采取快速攻击后迅速撤离的策略。他们只能尽力闪避，而一旦张开 AT 力场，Armisael 便会迅速改变方向，从另一侧发起攻击。

And it was getting faster. It wasn't long before they could hardly even track the Angel anymore.
它速度越来越快，没过多久，他们就几乎追踪不到天使的踪迹了。

"Lower all the buildings!" she shouted. "They're just getting in the way!"
把所有建筑都降下来！"她大声说道，"它们挡路了！

"Do it!" Misato ordered. "动手吧！" 碇真嗣命令道。

Seconds later the buildings of Tokyo-3 sank into the ground, turning the entire city into a giant flat space. The Angel seemed undeterred, continuing to zip around, but it was at least easier to follow. They decided to change tactics and cast aside the Pallet Rifle; not only could they not accurately shoot the Angel, it wouldn't accomplish anything anyway. Unit-02 drew its Progressive Knife and waited for the next strike.
几秒后，第三新东京市的建筑群沉入地底，整座城市化作一片广阔的平地。使徒似乎并未因此受阻，依旧快速穿梭，但至少追踪起来容易了些。他们决定改变策略，舍弃了弹药枪；不仅难以精准击中使徒，即便击中也毫无成效。二号机随即拔出高振动刀，静待下一次出击的机会。

Armisael flew at them once more, turning aside at the last second when Unit-02 attempted to slash at the head. As it went past, they stabbed the knife into the body of the Angel, struggling to hold on as it was almost yanked out of their grasp. The effect this time was much more pronounced. Armisael's body seemed to split back into the double helix around the wound as it screeched, but as was to be expected from an Angel it rapidly began to heal the wound. The Progressive Knife didn't come away much better either, both blade and handle now looking looking somewhat warped.
亚弥赛尔再次猛冲过来，当贰号机挥刀斩向其头部时，它及时侧身躲避。趁其掠过之际，他们将刀深深刺入天使体内，竭力握紧刀柄以防脱手。这次攻击效果显著，亚弥赛尔的身体在伤口处仿佛裂解成双螺旋形态，发出刺耳尖叫，但作为天使，它迅速启动了自我修复。而那把渐进式刀具也受损不轻，刀身与握把均现扭曲变形。

The head of Armisael doubled back on itself and charged directly at Unit-02 while the knife was still being dragged through the second half of its body. They put up an AT-Field, expecting the Angel to veer off again, but it continued straight on and smashed into the barrier, breaking through as if it wasn't there and continuing directly at the Evangelion. Two seconds later, she realised that nothing had apparently happened. Did the AT-Field manage to deflect the Angel just enough for it to barely scrape past? She tried to turn Unit-02 around to continue tracking the Angel, but the Evangelion suddenly felt incredibly sluggish.
阿米萨尔的头颅在自身上折返，并直接向二号机发起冲锋，此时刀刃仍在其身体后半部分拖行。他们展开了 AT 力场，预期天使会再次转向，然而它却径直冲撞在屏障上，仿佛屏障不存在般突破了防御，继续直奔福音战士而去。两秒后，她意识到似乎什么也没发生。难道 AT 力场成功地将天使稍作偏转，使其仅以微小差距擦肩而过？她试图让二号机转身继续追踪天使，但福音战士突然变得异常迟缓。

"Did it hit us?" she asked. "Something's happened to the Eva!"
它击中我们了吗？"她焦急地问。"伊娃出问题了！

"Asuka! Shinji!" Misato shouted through the comm. "Are you two alright?"
"明日香！真嗣！" 米萨托在通讯中急切地问道，“你们俩没事吧？”

"We're fine-" 我们挺好的-

"The Angel has rammed right into you!"
天使猛地撞到了你！

"Huh?" 嗯？

She looked down, struggling against a strange weight. Indeed, just as Misato had said, the Angel's head had smacked directly into their chest, piercing the armour so perfectly there was not a hint of a crack in the metal around where Armisael had penetrated.
她俯首凝视，竭力对抗着一股莫名的重压。正如美里所言，天使的头颅正中胸膛，精准地贯穿了护甲，以至于阿米萨尔穿透之处，金属表面竟无半点裂纹。

"Is it trying to attack Unit-02 from within?" she asked. "Apart from feeling like my sync's dropped nothing seems to... be..."
它是否正试图从内部攻击二号机？"她疑惑地问。"除了感觉同步率有所下降，其他似乎...并无异常...

Asuka blinked. Something was missing. Something that had been there up until only a few moments ago, now that she thought about it. "Shinji? Have you lost your sync or something?"
明日香眨了眨眼，感觉少了点什么。就在刚才还存在的东西，现在她才意识到。“真嗣，你是不是失去同步了？”

She leaned forward in her seat to check on her co-pilot. That mess of brown hair was still just below her, and Shinji's hands were still on his controls... but he wasn't responding.
她身体前倾，观察副驾驶的情况。那团凌乱的棕发仍在她下方，真嗣的手也依旧搭在操纵杆上……然而，他毫无反应。

"Shinji? Talk to me!" 真嗣？跟我聊聊！

"Oh... shit..." 哎呀... 糟了...

The curse from the command centre was not what Asuka wanted to hear. "Someone talk to me! What's going on?!"
指挥中心传来的坏消息让明日香心烦意乱。“谁能告诉我！发生了什么？！”

"The Angel..." came the shocked response. "It's... somehow attacking Shinji directly!"
是天使..."震惊的回应响起。"它...竟然直接对真嗣发起了攻击！

Asuka looked down at Shinji again, torn between trying to check on her co-pilot and maintaining control of the Evangelion. From above and behind she couldn't see anything wrong, but Shinji had still yet to give any sign that he was still conscious. Finally, throwing caution to the wind, Asuka jumped out of her seat and moved to the side of the second pilot seat.
明日香再次俯视真嗣，内心挣扎着是否该关注她的副驾驶，同时还得掌控福音战士。从高处和后方她看不出任何问题，但真嗣依旧没有表现出任何清醒的迹象。最终，她决定冒险，从座位上一跃而起，移步至第二驾驶员座位的侧边。

And now she could see that something was absolutely wrong.
此刻她清楚地意识到，事情绝对不对劲。

Shinji's gaze was vacant, his mouth hanging open... and his plugsuit was bulging like all the veins in his body were suddenly trying to escape his body. Even as Asuka stared in horror, the bulging began to grow up his neck and onto his face.
真嗣目光呆滞，嘴巴微张，身上的插入栓服鼓胀异常，仿佛全身血管都在试图挣脱束缚。明日香惊恐地看着这一切，鼓胀逐渐从他的脖子蔓延至面部。

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

With the limited connection she still had with Unit-02, Asuka tried to get the Evangelion to stab the Angel, to try and cut it away. The knife's blade, already damaged from its first attack, only made it half way through before shattering.
尽管与二号机的联系微弱，明日香还是尝试操控它，用刀刺向使徒，企图将其割裂。然而，刀刃因首次攻击已受损，仅切入一半就碎裂了。

Shinji wasn't reacting to anything, his empty stare unchanging, even when Asuka grabbed him by the shoulders and smacked him into his seat. Outside, the body of the Angel began to rapidly undulate, and the tail end was starting to get closer. Realisation quickly dawned; the Angel was trying to fully merge with Unit-02.
真嗣毫无反应，眼神空洞如初，即便明日香抓住他的双肩，用力将他推回座位。此时，外面的使徒身体剧烈波动，尾部正迅速靠近。众人随即明白，使徒正企图与二号机彻底融合。

Or rather... with- 更确切地说...与...

"SHINJI!" SHINJI!

XXX

Shinji opened his eyes with a gasp. Above him was yet another...
真嗣猛地睁开双眼，倒吸了一口凉气。他头顶上方，又是另一番景象...

"Unfamiliar ceiling...?" 陌生的天花板...？

Shinji blinked his eyes into focus. The hazy redness above him reformed into... red haze. Despite his best efforts, whatever was above him remained completely indistinct. He felt abnormally comfortable, like he was laying in a bed made of the softest material in the world. This proved that he clearly wasn't anywhere in NERV this time; those beds were... not exactly uncomfortable, but they left a lot to be desired.
真嗣眨了眨眼，努力让视线清晰起来。头顶上朦胧的红色渐渐凝聚成一片红雾。尽管他竭尽全力，但上方的事物依旧模糊不清。他感到一种异乎寻常的舒适，仿佛躺在世上最柔软的床上。这清楚地表明，他这次并不在 NERV 的任何地方；那里的床铺...虽不算不舒服，却也远非理想。

And then the last few minutes of memories slammed into Shinji's head.
紧接着，最后那几分钟的记忆如潮水般涌入真嗣的脑海。

He immediately sat up, and promptly lost balance as he began to sink. His efforts to stabilise himself sent orange flying about everywhere until his feet found a solid surface. Now standing up, Shinji could finally take in his surroundings, and it was even more bizarre than he expected. The red haze stretched on forever in all directions, met at the horizon by a sea of orange. He looked down to see that he was up to his hips in what was most likely LCL. He was also thankfully still wearing his plugsuit; he had been worried for a moment that he might have been naked.
他立刻坐起身，却因开始下沉而迅速失去平衡。为了稳住身体，他挥舞着手臂，橙色液体随之四溅，直到双脚触到坚实的地面。站稳后，真嗣终于能环顾四周，情况比他预想的还要诡异。红色的雾气在各个方向无限延伸，与地平线上的橙色海洋交汇。他低头一看，发现自己腰部以下都浸在很可能是 LCL 的液体中。幸好，他还穿着插入栓服；有那么一刻，他担心自己可能赤身裸体。

But... something was wrong with him. His veins were bulging all over his body, enough to be visible through the plugsuit. It looked as though it should be crippling him with agony, but Shinji felt nothing of the sort.
然而...他似乎出了些问题。他全身的血管异常鼓起，透过紧身战斗服都清晰可见。按理说这应该让他痛不欲生，但真嗣却毫无痛感。

"Asuka?" Shinji called out. "Where are you?"
Asuka？" 新二呼唤着。"你在哪里？

She is not here. 她不在这儿。

Shinji jolted at the sudden voice, looking all around for the source only to come up empty. The only person in this world of red and orange was him. "Stop hiding!" Shinji shouted into the void.
真嗣被突如其来的声音惊得一颤，环顾四周寻找声源，却毫无发现。在这片红橙交错的世界中，唯有他一人。“别躲躲藏藏了！”真嗣对着空旷处大声呼喊。

I am not hiding. 我并没有躲藏。

Shinji turned around... and was not very surprised when there was still nothing there. He huffed in irritation, picked a random direction, and began to wade through the LCL.
真嗣转过身，对于那里依旧空无一物并不感到太意外。他带着一丝不悦，哼了一声，随意挑了个方向，便开始在 LCL 中艰难前行。

Where are you trying to go?
你打算去哪儿？

The words did not actually seem to be reaching his ears at all; rather, it was like they simply... appeared in his mind as if he was just remembering them. Shinji ignored the voice; he had better things to do than listen to an Angel. And that was going to be interesting to report to NERV, especially since that committee of old men had asked whether the previous Angel had communicated with him and Asuka.
那些话语仿佛压根儿就没传进他的耳朵，更像是直接浮现在他的脑海中，如同他只是在回忆一般。真嗣对那声音置之不理；他还有更重要的事务，无暇聆听一个使徒的言语。这情况向 NERV 汇报时定会颇具趣味，尤其是那些老者委员会曾询问过前一个使徒是否与他及明日香有过沟通。

Speaking of which, where was Asuka? Shinji called out her name once more.
提到这个，明日香去哪儿了？真嗣又一次呼喊了她的名字。

She is not here.  她不在这儿。

Shinji came to a halt with a sigh. "Look, can you at least... appear in front of me so I'm not just yelling at thin air like a lunatic?"
真嗣停下脚步，叹了口气。“拜托，你至少...现身让我看见，免得我像对着空气自言自语的傻瓜一样。”

...Very well. 非常好。

The Angel finally made an appearance... and Shinji was finally surprised. And annoyed.
天使终于露面了……真嗣感到既惊讶又恼火。

Floating in the air in front of Shinji was... himself; plugsuit, A-10 clips and all. The only difference was the red eyes.
真嗣面前漂浮着的，正是他自己；身着连体战斗服，配备着 A-10 弹夹。唯一不同的是那双红色的眼睛。

"What do you want?" he asked. "What have you done with Asuka?!"
你到底想做什么？"他急切地问。"你对明日香做了什么？！

The Angel didn't bother moving its mouth to speak, or even move at all. It simply stood on the air like it was solid ground. The other remains untouched. You are the one I am interested in. You are the one that called to me.
天使并未移动嘴唇发声，也未曾动弹分毫。它宛如脚踏实地般悬浮于空中。周围一切依旧静止。我对你感兴趣，正是你呼唤了我。

"...Called to you?" he echoed.
他重复道：“...是在叫你吗？”

Yes.

"What are you talking about?"
你在谈论什么？

You are missing a fundamental piece of your self. I can help you.
你内心缺失了一块重要的部分，我可以帮助你找回。

Shinji was instantly wary; this Angel could somehow sense his lack of a soul. Were other Angels the same? Rei also somehow had the same ability. A memory surfaced: the spider Angel that had approached Asuka, Rei and himself out in the city and had taken the time to stop and stare. He had gotten the impression that it had been confused by him... and then it had looked at Rei and had practically retreated.
真嗣顿时心生警觉；这名使徒竟能感知到他灵魂的缺失。难道其他使徒也有此能力？绫波丽似乎同样具备这种感知。一段记忆涌上心头：那只蜘蛛形态的使徒曾在都市中靠近明日香、绫波丽和他，特意驻足凝视。他感觉到它对他的存在感到困惑……随后它转向绫波丽，几乎像是退缩了一般。

"Why would I accept help from you?" Shinji retorted, turning away from the Angel. "You Angels come here to kill us!"
我凭什么要接受你的帮助？" 真嗣反驳着，转身背对天使。"你们这些天使，来此不就是为了杀害我们吗！

Despite him turning away, the Angel was instantly back in front of him. I can help you. By giving you a soul.
即便他转身离去，天使瞬间又出现在他面前。我能助你一臂之力，赋予你一个灵魂。

Shinji faltered. "You... what...?"
真嗣迟疑地说："你...这是...什么意思？"

You lack a soul. Without it, you must rely upon another. I can join with you. You can become whole again. You would no longer feel like a burden. You would become her equal.
你失去了灵魂，必须依附他人。我愿与你融合，让你重获完整，不再自视为累赘，而是与她平起平坐。

"...A burden..." he mumbled, gaze unfocusing slightly.
"...一份重担..." 他低声嘟囔，眼神微微涣散。

Damnit. This Angel just had to go for that low blow. It just had to somehow know about that deep-seated insecurity he still felt. About how he constantly had to walk through the cage containing Unit-01 -and his mother- and not be able to get into that entry plug instead. Because Shinji Ikari was an idiot and sold his soul.
可恶，这天使偏要揭他的伤疤。它仿佛洞悉了他心底的自卑，每次他不得不经过装载着 Unit-01 和他母亲的笼子，却无法进入插入栓的那种无力感。因为真嗣·碇太愚蠢，竟出卖了自己的灵魂。

But... was this Angel even telling the truth? "How do I know you're being sincere?" asked Shinji. "How can I trust that you're not just going to... take me over and turn me against my friends?"
但是...这位天使的话真的可信吗？"我如何确定你是真诚的？" 真嗣质疑道。"我怎能相信你不会...操纵我，使我背叛朋友？"

There is more to come. More to test the resolve of the Lilim. Without my power you may not survive.
未来还有更多挑战。它们将考验莉莉姆的决心。若无我的力量，你们恐怕难以存活。

Shinji's limbs suddenly began to feel heavy. He looked down, and saw that the bulging veins under his plugsuit were now pulsing in time with his heartbeat. A heartbeat that was starting to quicken.
真嗣突然感到四肢沉重，低头一看，只见紧身服下的静脉随着心跳的加快而明显跳动。

You are alone. Weak. Together we can be strong.
你孤立无援，力量有限。我们联手则能变得强大。

"A... alone?" Shinji gasped as jolts of pain began to run up and down his body. "N-no. Not alone... Not when I'm with... her..."
A...我一个人吗？" 真嗣喘息着，疼痛开始在他全身蔓延。"不，不...不是一个人...当我和她在一起时...

Become one with me. Become strong enough to be worthy of standing by her side.
与我合而为一。变得强大到足以配得上站在她身旁。

The pain intensified. The edges of his vision began to turn red.
疼痛愈发剧烈，视野边缘逐渐染上了红色。

"A...Asuka..." 啊...是明日香...

She cannot help you here.
她在这儿帮不上忙。

XXX

"You can't help him right now!" Misato shouted. Asuka was focusing on Shinji instead of the Angel, even going so far as to abandon her seat. "I know you want to help him, but we have much bigger problems!"
你现在帮不了他！" 美里大声说道。明日香正专注于真嗣，而不是使徒，甚至离开了她的座位。"我明白你想帮他，但我们面临更大的危机！

Through the comm window, she watched Asuka stare helplessly back at them for a moment before angrily smashing a fist into the side of the entry plug and returning to her seat.
透过通讯窗口，她目睹明日香无助地回望片刻，紧接着怒气冲冲地一拳砸向插入栓侧壁，然后回到座位。

"Focus on trying to pull that Angel out," said Misato.
"集中精力试着把那个天使拽出来," 米萨托说。

With some effort, Unit-02 began to sluggishly move again. Its hands latched onto the Angel protruding from its chest but got no further.
经过一番努力，二号机再次缓慢地动了起来。它的手紧紧抓住了胸前突出的使徒，却未能再有进展。

"Contamination detected!" Shigeru reported. "The Angel is attempting to infest Unit-02 through its hands!"
检测到污染！" 碇真嗣报告道，"使徒正企图通过双手侵蚀二号机！

Unit-02 tried to let go of the Angel, but its hands now seemed glued to the glowing body.
二号机试图松开使徒，然而其双手仿佛被粘在了那熠熠生辉的躯体上。

"Oh come on!" Misato palmed her face. "That's some utter crap right there!"
哎呀，真是的！" 三佐捂脸叹道，"那完全是胡扯！

Makoto seemed about to add something, but a sound from his console interrupted him. "...Huh?" He typed away at his keyboard for a few moments while Misato looked on in puzzlement. "This... is unexpected."
真嗣本想再说些什么，却被控制台的声响打断了。“...咦？”他敲打键盘，美里则一脸困惑地旁观。“这...真是意料之外。”

"Mind sharing it with the rest of us?" Misato replied, rather more snappishly than she intended.
"能和大家分享一下吗？" Misato 回答时，语气比她本意要尖锐一些。

"Hmm? Oh!" Makoto turned in his chair towards her. "The Commander and Doctor Akagi are in Unit-00's cage. They're preparing it for launch!"
嗯？哦！" 真嗣转过椅子面向她。"指挥官和赤木博士正在零号机的机舱内，为启动做准备！

"What?! Patch me through to the cage!"
什么？！快帮我接通到关押处！

"On it!" 马上办！

As soon as Makoto gave the signal, Misato stepped forward. "Ritsuko, what's-"
真琴一发出信号，美里便迈步向前。“律子，这是怎么了-”

"No time! Talk later!" Ritsuko's words were followed by what sounded like a fist hitting metal, and then silence.
"没时间了！稍后再聊！" 紧接着是拳头撞击金属的声响，随后陷入沉默。

Misato took a moment to sigh, then gave another order. "In that case, give me visual of the cage."
碇真嗣稍作停顿，轻叹一声，接着下达指令："那么，把笼子的影像调出来。"

"Is now really the time to divert our attention, Major?" asked Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. "Surely it's enough right now to know that we'll soon have another Eva in the fight."
少校，现在真的有必要转移我们的注意力吗？"副指挥官冬月质疑道。"目前我们即将有新的 Eva 加入战斗，这难道还不够吗？

"But... ugh." Misato resisted the urge to palm her face again. He was right, of course. She returned her attention to the more urgent matter at hand.
"可是...真是的。" 三佐强忍着再次捂脸的冲动。他说的没错。她随即把注意力转回到眼前更为紧急的事情上。

XXX

Every moment was pain. Every movement was pain. Every thought was pain.
每一刻都充满痛苦，每一次动作都伴随着痛苦，每一个想法都浸透了痛苦。

Rei's body was halfway towards collapsing in on itself. As it was, some of her skin was left behind on the hands of Doctor Akagi and Commander Ikari when they carried her into the entry plug. She couldn't reach the controls, but that didn't matter; there would be no weapons being used. She knew what had to be done to stop this Angel.
绫波的身体已近崩溃边缘。实际上，当赤木博士和碇司令将她送入插入栓时，她的皮肤碎片留在了他们手上。她够不到控制台，但这已无关紧要；不会有武器启用。她清楚必须采取何种措施来阻止这名使徒。

Commander Ikari gave her one final, unreadable look before leaving the entry plug. She did her best to stay in her seat as the entry plug was inserted and Unit-00 activated. She sighed with relief as she synchronised, the larger body helping to dilute the pain sensations somewhat.
伊卡里指挥官在离开插入栓前，向她投去了一个深不可测的最后一瞥。她努力稳坐在座位上，随着插入栓被安置到位，零号机随之激活。当同步顺利进行时，她如释重负地叹了口气，机体的庞大身躯在某种程度上缓解了痛感的冲击。

Unit-00 was loaded onto the catapult and launched up to the surface. The time seemed to both pass in an instant and last an eternity, but soon Rei was able to look upon this city for the last time.
单元 00 被装载到弹射器上，随即发射升空至地表。时间流逝的感觉既快如闪电又慢如永恒，不久，绫波得以最后一次凝视这座城市。

"Wondergirl?" Asuka's voice made her smile slightly, but it was a sad smile. "Goddamn am I glad to see you up here!"
神奇女孩？" 阿苏卡的声音让她嘴角微扬，却带着一丝哀愁。"真他妈高兴能在这儿见到你！

"Shinji... is he..." 真嗣...他怎么了？

"I don't know. The Angel seems to be focusing entirely on him. I tried to pull it out but now my hands are stuck!"
我不清楚。天使好像完全盯上了他。我尝试把它拽出来，结果现在手被卡住了！

"I will... assist." 我会提供帮助。

"Rei!" A comm window opened, showing Misato's face. She flinched upon seeing the state of her, but pressed on. "Head to-"
Rei！" 通讯窗口弹出，美里的面容映入眼帘。她见到她的模样时明显一愣，随即坚定地说：“去往-

"Sorry," Rei interrupted. "Have orders."
抱歉，" 雷插话道。"我接到命令了。

"...I see." 我明白了。

It was technically the truth. Commander Ikari and Doctor Akagi had given her instructions on how and where to initiate the Evangelion's self-destruct sequence. They had partially begun the sequence for her; all she had to do was key in the final commands at the right time.
严格来说，这确实是事实。伊卡里指挥官和赤木博士已指导她如何及何时启动福音战士的自毁程序。他们已为她预先启动了部分程序，她只需在恰当的时刻输入最后的指令。

Unit-00 loped across the city to where the other end of the Angel was lazily flapping about. Rei grabbed the tail and quickly wrapped an arm up in it. The Angel started to try and shake her off, but she spun the entire Evangelion around several times to essentially tie herself up with the Angel. She continued like this, wrapping more and more of the Angel around Unit-00, making sure to keep her legs free.
零号机穿越城市，奔向使徒另一端悠然摆动的所在。绫波一把抓住使徒的尾巴，迅速用一只手臂将其缠绕。使徒开始挣扎，试图摆脱，然而绫波借助旋转之力，将整个福音战士机体与使徒紧密缠绕，同时巧妙地保持双腿的活动空间。

It wasn't long before Unit-00 reached the stricken Unit-02. Rei proceeded to sweep the other Evangelion's legs out from underneath it and then, ignoring Asuka's confused shouts, planted a boot on the red chest and heaved with as much strength as she could spare. The entire Angel began to convulse, trying to free itself, but Rei had made sure to essentially tie knots in its body as she gathered it up.
不久，零号机便赶到了受损的二号机旁边。绫波丽迅速出腿将另一台福音战士绊倒，接着，无视明日香的困惑呼喊，一脚重重踩在红色机体的胸口，倾尽全力拉扯。整个使徒开始剧烈抽搐，试图挣脱，但绫波丽已巧妙地在它的身体上打结，确保将其紧紧束缚。

Through the comm system, Rei heard a loud gasp from Shinji and a cry of surprise from Asuka as the 'head' of the Angel came free. She wasted no time and grabbed it as best as she could before ramming it into Unit-00's body. She then turned the Evangelion around and began to run towards Lake Ashi.
通过通讯系统，绫波丽听到真嗣的一声大喘气和明日香的惊叫，因为使徒的“头部”脱离了。她立刻行动，尽力抓住它，随即将其猛插入零号机体内。接着，她操控着福音战士转身，朝着芦之湖疾驰而去。

The Angel tried to fight back by infesting Unit-00. The armour around the Evangelion's arms and body shattered, and Rei felt yet more pain as something began to grow out of 'her' back. She couldn't see what it was, but the extra weight was already slowing her down.
天使企图通过侵入零号机进行反击。覆盖在福音战士手臂及躯干上的装甲纷纷破碎，绫波丽感到背部有异物生长，剧痛加剧。虽然看不见那异物，但其重量已明显拖累了她的行动。

You would sacrifice yourself in order to save your fellow Lilim?
你愿意牺牲自己来救你的莉莉姆同伴吗？

Rei frowned at the voice inside her head. 'Yes,' she thought back at it. 'This shell is irrelevant. I would gladly perish to protect humanity.
零皱眉回应脑海中的声音：“没错，”她心中回应，“这副躯壳无关紧要。为了保护人类，我甘愿牺牲。”'

The Angel... ceased its struggling. I see that there will be no persuading you otherwise.
天使...已不再挣扎。我看出无论如何也说服不了你。

'No.'

"What the hell are you doing, Wondergirl?!"
神奇女孩，你究竟在做什么？

Rei struggled to shift her head to face her fellow pilot. "Stay... back," she weakly said.
绫努力转动头部，面向她的同伴驾驶员。“别过来，”她声音微弱地说。

Asuka tilted her head, puzzled. "Why are you letting the Angel infest your Eva? And where are you... going..." Realisation struck; her eyes widened. "Oh hell no! You are not going to blow yourself up, Wondergirl!"
明日香歪着头，一脸困惑。"你干嘛让使徒侵蚀你的 Eva？还有，你这是要去...哪儿..." 突然间，她恍然大悟，眼睛瞪得老大。"绝对不行！你别想自爆，奇迹少女！"

"You're going to what?!" Misato shouted.
"你要去干嘛?!" 碇真嗣惊呼道。

"Unit-00's self-destruct sequence has been initiated!" one of the bridge crew reported with alarm.
"Unit-00 已启动自毁程序！" 桥上的一名船员惊慌地报告。

Rei shook her head. "Have to. No other way."
瑞摇摇头说：“只能这样，别无选择。”

Asuka snarled in frustration, but her Evangelion remained where it was. "God... goddamnit, Rei," she muttered. "Is there no other way to kill that thing?"
明日香气愤地咆哮，然而她的福音战士依旧静止不动。“天哪……真是的，绫波，”她低声抱怨，“难道就没有其他办法消灭那家伙吗？”

"None. Pull back... help Shinji."
什么也没有。退后...去帮真嗣。

Unit-02 got to its feet. In the comm window, Asuka angrily looked away. "...We were supposed to all make it through this damn war. First Glasses, almost Shinji, and now you..."
二号机站了起来。通讯窗口里，明日香气愤地扭过头。“……我们本该一起熬过这场战争。先是眼镜，差点轮到真嗣，现在又轮到你了……”

Rei smiled slowly. Unit-00 was almost at the lake. "Should tell... him." The smile widened slightly as a hint of a blush managed to sneak onto Asuka's face.
绫波缓缓露出微笑，零号机已接近湖畔。“得告诉他...”想到这里，她的笑容更甚，脸上不禁泛起一抹红晕。

"R-Rei...?" Shinji called out, sounding almost as weak as Rei.
"R-绫波...？" 真嗣轻声呼唤，声音与绫波一样无力。

"Shinji... sorry." Rei lifted her arm, ready to input the final command to initiate the self-destruct. She unfurled her own AT-Field, then inverted it. The Angel's body began to get swallowed up by Unit-00's core. "Retreat. Be safe. Live well."
真嗣...抱歉。" 绫波抬起手臂，准备输入最后指令以启动自毁。她展开自己的 AT 力场，并将其反转。使徒的身体逐渐被零号机的核心吞没。"撤退吧。保重，好好活下去。

"Damnit, Rei!" Misato seemed to be struggling to hold back tears. "Asuka, return to-"
该死，丽！" 美里眼眶含泪，努力克制着情绪。"明日香，快回来！

Asuka resolutely shook her head. "We're staying up here," she stubbornly replied. "We're out of the blast radius, and I'm not leaving you to die alone. Besides... if this doesn't work someone has to finish the Angel off."
明日香坚定地摇了摇头，说：“我们要留在这里。”她语气坚决。“我们已经不在爆炸范围内了，我不会丢下你一个人去面对死亡。再说了……万一这招不奏效，总得有人来解决掉那个使徒。”

"Will work. Trust me. But... thank you. For everything." Unit-00 fell to the ground on the shore of Lake Ashi. She didn't have the strength left to get back up.
"会成功的。请相信我。不过...还是要感谢你，为了一切。" 零号机倒在了芦之湖的岸边，她已无力再起身。

"...Goodbye, Wondergirl."
...再见，奇迹女孩。

"Good... bye..." 再见...

Her hand fell onto the final button. Unit-00's core began to overload as the growth on her back vanished. Every remaining piece of armour fell to the ground as the Evangelion's body changed. For one brief moment as she became Unit-00, Rei looked back at her fellow pilots, and waved at them.
她的手触碰到最后一个按钮，零号机的核心随即开始过载，背部的异物迅速消退。随着装甲片片落地，初号机的形态发生了变化。那一刻，化身为零号机的绫波丽短暂回首，向其他驾驶员挥手致意。

The very last image this one saw was a giant red hand waving back.
它最后看到的景象是一只巨大的红色手掌在挥舞。

Deep inside NERV, a pair of red eyes opened and looked up at the ceiling. Their owner let out a low sigh.
在 NERV 总部深处，一双红眼缓缓睁开，凝视着天花板。其主人不禁发出一声沉重的叹息。

In another part of NERV, a pair of red eyes opened. Their owner stared out through the orange liquid.
在 NERV 的另一区域，一双红眼睁开，其主人透过橙色液体凝视着外界。

In another part of NERV, a pair of red eyes opened, after being closed for a long time.

### Chapter 44 Tell Us About Rei!

Misato stared at the screen showing an overhead view of Lake Ashi, now somewhat larger in size. Unit-00's detonation had gouged a massive hole out of the earth, while the shockwave had devastated a good chunk of Tokyo-3. The civilian population had already started questioning NERV's ability to actually protect the city after the Fourteenth Angel had blown a massive hole right in the middle of it. Now people were starting to flee the city in droves for Tokyo-2. The Japanese government had had some... comments about the sudden influx of what amounted to refugees in their own country.
美里凝视着屏幕上芦之湖的鸟瞰图，湖面比以往更宽阔了。零号机的爆炸在地上留下了一个巨大的坑洞，冲击波也摧毁了东京-3 的大片区域。第十四使徒在市中心造成的巨大破坏，让市民们开始质疑 NERV 保护城市的能力。如今，人们纷纷逃离此地，涌向东京-2。日本政府对这突如其来的国内难民潮也发表了一些...看法。

The pilots' friends and their families were among those that had opted to leave, which had only worsened Asuka's mood since she had to say goodbye to the Horaki girl. After some pointed words from the patriarch of the Suzuhara family, Hisae had been quickly evaluated and deemed recovered enough to no longer need the advanced facilities of NERV. After some more words, NERV had ensured a place for her in one of Tokyo-2's hospitals and would cover the bill for the rest of her treatments.
飞行员的朋友及其家属选择离开，这让明日香的心情更加沉重，因为她必须与洞木光告别。铃原家的长辈一番话后，Hisae 很快被评估为已康复到无需 NERV 高级设施的程度。经过进一步沟通，NERV 安排她在东京-2 的一家医院继续治疗，并负责承担所有后续费用。

Misato had, with great reluctance, asked Asuka to request that Horaki take Pen-pen with her, and thankfully she had agreed. Things were just going to be too hectic now for Misato to have the time to go back home and feed him. Even if Pen-pen could somewhat look after himself if there was food he could access, it just wasn't fair for him to be left home alone. Genetically engineered though he might be, penguins were still social creatures.
三佐虽极不情愿，还是拜托明日香让堀木带上企鹅彭彭，幸好她答应了。如今事务繁忙，三佐实在无暇回家照料它。即便彭彭能自行觅食，让它独守空巢也未免不公。毕竟，即便经过基因改造，企鹅仍是群居生物。

Hisae had been rather... happy to learn that Hikari would be looking after Pen-pen, despite having never met him before.
尽管之前未曾谋面，久江得知光将照看企鹅 Pen-pen 时，还是感到相当高兴。

For the nth time Misato raised a hand to her forehead to try and rub the ache away to no avail. To top everything off she had a splitting headache, she was sweating despite NERV's climate control, and her hands were shaking. The withdrawal was starting to hit her hard, but she couldn't let herself slip back into old habits. Something was rotten in NERV, and she needed to find out what was going on.
第 n 次，葛城美里再次举手按住额头，试图缓解疼痛却徒劳无功。更糟糕的是，她头痛欲裂，尽管 NERV 有气候控制，她仍在出汗，双手颤抖。戒断症状开始强烈袭来，但她不能让自己重蹈覆辙。NERV 内部显然有问题，她必须查明真相。

She tapped on the keyboard, banishing the sight of one of her charge's deaths with a low sigh, and continued digging. An hour later, she pulled Kaji's flash drive out of the computer, dropped it in an inner pocket of her jacket, and left the room without bothering to see if the corridor was empty. If there was someone out there, it would be far less suspicious to simply act as if she belonged here.
她轻敲键盘，低声叹息，将眼前一位受监护人的死亡景象抛诸脑后，继续深入调查。一小时后，她从电脑中取出 Kaji 的 U 盘，放入夹克的内侧口袋，随即离开房间，并未费心查看走廊是否有人。若真有人，表现得若无其事反而更不易引起怀疑。

Misato got into an elevator and checked her watch. She glanced at the buttons, then back at her watch again, before making a decision on where to go next.
碇真嗣步入电梯，瞥了一眼手表。她目光掠过按钮，再次低头看表，随即做出了下一步的决定。

Perhaps what she really needed to do right now was have a chat with someone.
或许她此刻真正需要的，是找个人聊一聊。

The steady beeping of the heart monitor did little to ease Asuka's concerns. Even a day later, Shinji's body was still suffering the effects of the Angel's attempt to... infest him? It was impossible to tell at the moment, but after being swiftly moved to quarantine after recovery from Unit-02, he had just as quickly been declared 'clean' and moved to the hospital room where Asuka was now sitting by his bed. And wondering why she couldn't bring herself to leave the room apart from dealing with her body's needs.
心率监测器的持续哔哔声几乎无法缓解明日香的忧虑。即便过了一天，真嗣的身体仍在承受使徒试图侵占他的影响。目前尚难断定，但他在从二号机恢复后被迅速转移至隔离区，不久又被宣告“无感染”，转至医院病房，明日香此刻正坐在他床边。她不解为何除了满足生理需求外，自己无法离开这个房间。

Oh, wait. It was because she was missing the synchronisation.
哦，稍等。问题在于她没有进行同步。

The veins on Shinji's body were still bulging like a steroid-abusing athlete across his entire body apart from his face. Shinji would very slightly twitch on occasion, a possible sign of nerve damage. Each time it happened Asuka would think he was about to wake up, only to be disappointed. There was apparently nothing the doctors could do besides wait and see if his body returned to normal.
真嗣全身的血管依旧鼓胀，如同滥用类固醇的运动员，唯独脸部例外。他偶尔会轻微抽搐，这或许是神经受损的征兆。每当此时，明日香都以为他要苏醒，却总是落空。医生们除了等待他身体自然恢复，似乎也束手无策。

A knock at the door, followed by the sound of it opening, caught part of Asuka's attention. Thinking that it was just a doctor or nurse, she paid it no mind until she felt a hand on her shoulder.
敲门声后紧接着开门声，吸引了明日香的部分注意。她原以为只是医生或护士，并未在意，直到一只手搭上了她的肩膀。

"Hope you're not planning on doing the same thing Shinji did for you."
希望你没打算效仿真嗣为你所做的。

Asuka snorted, looking up to the source of the voice. "No, Misato. I just don't have anything better I feel like doing right now."
明日香哼了一声，抬头看向声音的源头。“不是的，美里。我只是现在没什么特别想做的事。”

Misato grinned weakly at her. "Just making sure. You two do have that synchronisation thing."
真嗣苦笑着对她说：“只是确认一下。你们俩确实有那种同步感应。”

"Yeah, well, nothing's happening on that front right now, I can guarantee it," Asuka stonily replied.
"是的，目前那个方面确实没有任何动静，我可以保证。" 明日香冷冷地回应。

The expression on Misato's face faded back to seriousness. "Asuka, I know we've already been through the debriefing but just between us... are you alright? Nothing happened to you during the fight?"
碇真嗣脸上的表情重新变得严肃。“明日香，虽然我们已经完成了汇报，但私下里我还是想问……你真的没事吗？战斗中没遇到什么问题吧？”

"No. I didn't even feel anything when the Angel pierced Unit-02's chest." Apart from shock at what was happening to Shinji. "And like I said, while Shinji was incapacitated it felt like I was at less than half my usual sync rate when I tried to move my Eva."
不，使徒穿透二号机胸膛那一刻，我毫无感觉，只是对真嗣遭遇的变故感到震惊。正如我之前所说，真嗣无法行动时，我尝试操控 Eva，却感觉同步率远低于平时的水平。

"Which Ritsuko said was likely due to interference from the Angel," said Misato. She sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. "These last few Angels have been really testing our ability to bounce back afterwards."
正如 Ritsuko 所言，这很可能是天使干扰所致，"Misato 叹息着，用手揉了揉脸。"最近这几个天使确实在考验我们事后的恢复力。

Asuka scowled and turned back to look at Shinji, muttering a curse under her breath. "That's an understatement. We've-" She stopped, quickly rubbing at her eyes. "We've just lost Wond- I mean Rei, and we'll probably lose Aida very soon. Even if you could bring another pilot in, we only have two Evas and one of them only accepts Shinji and myself."
明日香皱着眉头，转过身来瞪着真嗣，嘴里低声咒骂着。“这简直是轻描淡写。我们刚失去了——我是说，丽，而且很可能不久就会失去相田。就算你能再找来一个驾驶员，我们也只有两台 Eva，其中一台只认我和真嗣。”

Several tense seconds passed before Misato glumly replied, "...I'm sorry, but I don't really know what to say."
几秒紧张的沉默后，Misato 神情沮丧地回应：“……抱歉，我实在不知道该说什么好。”

"Say that she'll be remembered," Asuka retorted. "Say that her death won't be in vain. Say that you're doing everything you can to find out just what the absolute fuck is going on in NERV!"
说清楚，她会被铭记，" 明日香反驳道。"她的牺牲不会徒劳。告诉我，你正竭尽全力去揭开 NERV 中究竟发生了什么荒唐事！

"I am doing what I can," said Misato. "In fact I came here right after... well actually I think we better pause this topic before we get overheard."
我正在尽力而为，"Misato 说道。"其实我一来就...不过，我们还是先别谈这个了，免得被人听见。

Asuka glanced at Misato out of the corner of her eye for a moment, before turning to face her fully. She noticed there was a fine sheen of sweat on her guardian's face. Didn't Rei mention something about sweating as a possible symptom of quitting drinking cold turkey? "Fine," she said. "What else do you want to talk about?"
明日香从眼角瞥了美里一眼，然后完全转过身来。她注意到美里脸上有一层薄汗。丽之前不是说过，突然戒酒可能会导致出汗吗？“行吧，”她说，“你还想聊些什么？”

"Well... recently I've been really noticing how the two of you have been acting." Misato gestured at Shinji. "For instance, that wedding I went to earlier this year? You two remind me so much of those newlyweds. And hell, when I went into your apartment he was brushing your hair. That's a very close thing."
最近我特别留意到你们俩的互动。比如，我今年初参加的那场婚礼，你们俩的相处模式让我想起了那些新婚燕尔。还有，我进你们公寓时，他正在帮你梳头，这举动可真够亲密的。

Asuka flushed slightly and her gaze darted to the side. "My hair was a mess, and we'd just worked out how to restore our synchronisation."
明日香脸上泛起红晕，眼神不自觉地瞥向别处。"我头发乱成一团，我们才刚弄清楚如何恢复同步。"

"Perhaps, but-" Misato stopped and looked at her watch. "Damn, gotta head back to my office. Okay... I have one question for you, and I want you to think on it." She walked over to the door and opened it, turning to look back at Asuka. "At this point in your relationship, if something were to happen to either of you, will there be any difference at all if you decide to go ahead and make things official?"
或许，但是——" 碇真嗣突然停下，瞥了一眼手表，"糟糕，得赶回办公室了。听着...我有个问题，你得认真想想。" 她走向门口，打开后回头望向明日香，"在你们现在的关系阶段，如果你们中有人遭遇不测，你们决定正式在一起后，会有什么不同吗？

The door closed, but Asuka barely noticed as the question flooded her mind while she stared at the boy in the bed.
门悄然关闭，明日香却浑然不觉，她的思绪被那个问题占据，目光紧锁在床上的男孩身上。

"...Damnit," she muttered, after an unknown amount of time had passed, and got to her feet. She stood next to the bed and slowly took one of Shinji's hands into her own. Without the synchronisation, the action didn't feel quite the same, but she felt like she had to do it anyway. "You damn well better wake up soon, Shinji. We need to get through this... together."
...真是的，" 她低声嘟囔，不知过了多久，终于站起身来。她站在床边，缓缓地握住真嗣的一只手。没有了同步，这动作虽感不同，但她觉得非做不可。"真嗣，你最好快点醒来。我们得一起挺过这一关...

Asuka leaned down, and gently pressed her lips to Shinji's forehead. For a moment she thought she felt something, but soon dismissed it as a figment of her imagination. Her stomach chose that moment to grumble, reminding her that she hadn't eaten in a while. She reluctantly let go of Shinji's hand, and headed out of the room.
明日香弯下腰，温柔地吻在真嗣的额头上。那一刻，她似乎有所感触，但随即认为是自己的错觉。此时，她的肚子发出咕噜声，提醒她已许久未进食。她依依不舍地放开真嗣的手，离开了房间。

In the corridor, Asuka just barely caught sight of Misato and Doctor Akagi walking off together. Something about the way they were moving caught her attention. Setting aside her hunger for the moment, she headed off after them.
走廊中，明日香恰好瞥见美里与赤木博士一同离去。他们行走的姿态吸引了她的注意，于是她暂时搁置了饥饿感，尾随其后。

Misato looked back at the closed door. All she could do now was hope that her words had kicked something loose in Asuka's mind; that the poor young girl would finally grab onto that chance for happiness. She turned to leave... only to immediately stop in her tracks because of somebody standing in her way.
美里回头凝视着紧闭的门，心中期盼自己的话语能在明日香心中激起涟漪，让这位不幸的少女终能抓住幸福的契机。她正欲离去，却因前方有人而戛然而止。

"Misato," said Ritsuko by way of greeting.
"Misato," 丽莎以此作为问候。

"...Rits," Misato replied with a slight tilt of her head.
"...Rits," 米萨托说着，头微微一偏。

"You could at least give some indication of where you are when you're not in your office, instead of dropping off the grid for an hour."
你不在办公室时，至少应该告知一下大概位置，别让人一个小时都联系不上你。

Misato blinked, then realisation dawned. "Oh. Right." She pulled out her phone and turned it back on. "Damnit, can't believe I forgot about that. Oh well, at least we have a P.A. system."
三笠眨了眨眼，随即恍然大悟。“哦，对。”她掏出手机重新开机。“真糟糕，我竟然忘了这事。不过还好，我们至少有扩音系统。”

Ritsuko sighed and palmed her face. "That's not the point-... whatever. I've been looking for you because something's happened that I need to talk to you about."
律子叹了口气，用手捂脸。“那不是关键……算了。我一直在找你，因为有件事得跟你商量。”

"...What kind of 'something'?" asked Misato, eyes already starting to narrow in suspicion.
"...什么样的'东西'？" 美里问道，眼中已开始流露出怀疑的神色。

"The kind that's easiest to just show you. Follow me."
最容易直接展示给你的那种。跟我来。

Without waiting to see if Misato would follow, Ritsuko turned and headed off down the corridor at a fast walk. Misato quickly hurried after her, trying to work out if she had already been caught snooping. Strangely, Ritsuko didn't even leave the medical ward. She simply turned a couple of corners, heading into the intensive care wing, then stopped outside just another door into a hospital room. The odds werenow fairly good that this wasn't about what she had been doing.
不等確認葛城美里是否跟上，律子便轉身快步沿走廊前行。美里急忙追趕，心中忐忑不安，猜測自己是否已經被發現偷窺。出乎意料的是，律子並未離開醫療區，只是拐了幾個彎，進入重症監護區，然後停在又一間病房門前。看來，這件事與她之前的行為無關的可能性頗高。

Misato stopped at the door, frowning at Ritsuko even as her friend gestured for her to enter first. She hesitantly opened the door and stepped in, steeling herself for whatever was to come. Yet, as it turned out, nothing could have prepared her for what was in the room.
真嗣在门口驻足，眉头紧锁地望着丽，尽管好友示意她先行。她迟疑地推开门，踏入其中，心中已做好应对一切的准备。然而，房间内的情景，却是她无论如何也未曾预料到的。

A blue-haired girl lay in bed, with most of her face bandaged. A girl that Misato was sure had just recently sacrificed herself to save her friends. She rounded on Ritsuko, who was still standing out in the corridor. "What the hell?!"
一位蓝发少女躺在床上，脸部大部分被绷带覆盖。正是那位，碇真嗣坚信不久前为救朋友而自我牺牲的女孩。她怒视着仍在走廊上的律子，质问道：“这究竟是怎么一回事？！”

"She just barely survived," said Ritsuko. "The entry plug ejected at the absolute last second and-"
她勉强逃过一劫，"里津子说道。"插入栓在千钧一发之际弹出，紧接着-

"Cut the bullshit!" Misato shouted. "Don't try and tell me Ayanami survived her Eva exploding! What happened to those things being able to survive N2 mines when the pilots would still die?! Is this just a mannequin? Or perhaps you convinced someone to dress up like her?"
别扯淡了！" 葛城怒吼道。"别跟我说绫波的 Eva 爆炸后她还能幸存！不是说那些机体能在 N2 地雷中存活而驾驶员却会丧命吗？！这难道只是个假人？还是你找人冒充她了？

Ritsuko stared at her for a long time. Just as Misato was about to push past her and storm off, she sighed and put a hand to her forehead. "I knew this wasn't going to slip by you," she said. "Even distracted as you are with other things, and dealing with withdrawal, you're too sharp for this."
律子凝视了她许久。就在美里打算推开她，怒气冲冲地离开时，她叹了口气，用手扶额。“我就知道这事逃不过你的眼睛，”她说，“即便你被其他事务牵扯，又处于戒断期，你的洞察力依旧敏锐。”

"...What are you saying?" Misato slowly asked.
"...你到底在说什么？" 碇真嗣缓缓地问道。

"I'm saying that you're right." Ritsuko stepped into the room and closed the door, then stared at the girl on the bed. "If you want to get technical, this isn't the Rei Ayanami from a few days ago." Before Misato could speak up, Ritsuko turned her head towards her. "And I know you; you won't just let this rest."
我承认你是对的。" 律子步入房间，随手关上门，目光紧锁在床上的女孩身上。"严谨地说，这不是几天前的那个绫波丽。" 在美里插话之前，律子已将视线转向她。"我清楚你的性格，你不会轻易放过这件事。

"You're goddamn right I won't!" Misato retorted. "I want some answers!"
你说的没错，我绝不会罢休！" 碇真嗣反驳道，"我需要一些解释！

"Before that, I need you to calm down," Ritsuko stolidly replied. "I know aggression is a symptom of alcohol withdrawal but this is uncalled for."
在那之前，我得让你冷静下来，" 律子坚定地说。"我明白攻击性是酒精戒断的一种表现，但这种行为实在不妥。

"What?" Misato blinked several times, then realised that she and Ritsuko were face to face. And she was holding her friend by the collar. She quickly let go and backed away a few steps. "...Oh. Er... sorry?" Damnit. The withdrawal had to really be getting to her if she was lashing out without even being aware of it.
"什么？" 葛城美里眨了眨眼，这才意识到自己和律子正面对面，而且她还抓着对方的衣领。她赶紧松开手，退后几步。"...哦。呃...抱歉？" 真是的。如果她连自己都没意识到就发泄出来，那一定是撤退的压力真的让她难以自控了。

Ritsuko gave her the slightest of smirks as she readjusted her collar. "I'll let it slide for now, since I know you've got a lot on your mind. It's just a shame I'll soon be adding to that."
律子调整衣领时，对她微微一笑。“这次我暂且放过你，我知道你心事重重。不过，我很快就要给你增加负担了，真是遗憾。”

"Just what the hell are you talking about?"
你究竟在说什么啊？

Ritsuko shook her head, then gestured towards the door. "Honestly, it would be far easier to just show you. Come with me; we're going for a walk."
律子摇摇头，随即指向门。“说实话，直接带你去看更简单。跟我来，我们去走走。”

Misato raised an eyebrow as Ritsuko once again quickly took off. This time however, they ended up at the elevator. When they stepped inside, Ritsuko pressed one of the lowest floor buttons, not all that far away from the one Misato had used to follow Kaji back when she'd discovered what was lurking in NERV's basement. As the door began to close, Misato thought she caught a flash of familiar red.
三笠挑眉，见律子再次匆匆离去。这次，两人来到了电梯口。进入电梯后，律子按下了接近底层的按钮，与三笠当初追踪卡吉时所按的按钮相距不远，那时她发现了 NERV 地下的秘密。电梯门缓缓合上之际，三笠似乎瞥见了一抹熟悉的红色。

The descent was uncomfortably long; Misato knew Ritsuko wouldn't bother answering any questions yet, so the journey was made in silence. After what felt like an eternity, the elevator finally came to a halt and Ritsuko stepped out into a corridor illuminated by weak lighting, putting a hand into her labcoat's pocket. Already suspicious, Misato was slower to follow. Just before she exited the elevator, she quickly pressed a couple of buttons on the panel and stepped out just as the doors were about to close on her.
下降过程漫长得让人难受；Misato 清楚 Ritsuko 现在不会回答任何问题，所以两人一路无言。仿佛过了许久，电梯终于停下，Ritsuko 走出电梯，进入一条光线昏暗的走廊，随手将手插进实验服口袋。Misato 已起疑心，稍慢一步跟上。就在她即将步出电梯时，她迅速在控制面板上按了几下，恰好在电梯门即将关闭之际迈出。

"So have I been brought down here to make it easier to hide my body?" Misato joked, making a show of pausing and looking around. The corridor was short, with a rather plain-looking security door not far away from the elevator
"难道我是被特意带到这儿，方便藏尸？" 碇真嗣打趣道，故意停下脚步，四处张望。走廊不长，电梯不远处有一扇外观朴素的安保门。

Ritsuko snorted and turned to face her. "Well I'm not planning anything of the sort," she remarked. "I rather like having my best friend still among the living, even if you're making my job harder."
律子哼了一声，转过身来面对她。“我可没打算那样做，”她评论道，“我更希望我的好朋友还活着，即便你给我的工作增加了难度。”

"Sorry, but there's too much going on that directly affects me and-" Misato cut herself off before she could accidentally reveal too much. "...and I'm not just going to do nothing," she carefully continued.
"抱歉，但太多事情直接牵扯到我，我-" 三佐及时打住，以免不慎泄露过多。"...我不能袖手旁观，" 她小心翼翼地接着说。

Ritsuko at least had the decency to look sad. "Yeah... I know. I kinda miss him too, even if he was a womanising asshole at times. I really hate to say it, but it was almost a guarantee that he'd die, considering what he was doing."
理子至少还表现出了一丝悲伤。“嗯...我明白。我也有点怀念他，虽然他有时是个花心的混蛋。我实在不愿这么说，但考虑到他的所作所为，他的死几乎是注定的。”

Misato didn't want to comment on it; she was having a hard enough time trying to keep her mind on what she needed to do while her mind insisted on recalling every tiny detail about Ryoji Kaji. "Well anyway... let's just keep going."
三嶋不愿对此置评；她本就难以集中精力处理手头事务，脑海中却不断浮现出关于加持良治的点点滴滴。“算了，不管怎样……我们继续前进吧。”

"In a bit," said Ritsuko, taking her hand out of her pocket and bringing with it her tablet. "We just need to wait for the elevator to come back down with the last member of our little expedition."
稍等片刻，"理佐子边说边从口袋中掏出手，手中还握着她的平板。"我们得等电梯把最后一位探险队员送下来。

"What?" Instantly on the alert, Misato took a step back and to the side to keep both her friend and the elevator in view.
"什么？" Misato 立刻警觉，后退一步并侧身，确保同时能看到朋友和电梯。

"Despite all the time you spent with Kaji, you apparently didn't pick up any of his subtlety." Ritsuko waved the tablet. "Access down this far is restricted and monitored. I knew the moment you pressed that button."
尽管你与 Kaji 相处甚久，却似乎未曾领悟他的细腻之处。" Ritsuko 挥了挥手中的平板。"此等深度的访问权限受限且受到监控，你一触碰按钮，我便已知晓。

"...So then you know who's coming down here," said Misato.
"...那么，你就知道谁要来这儿了，"米萨托说道。

"Actually, I felt like being surprised by who you planned to bring down here. I'll find out when the door opens." Ritsuko leaned against the wall of the corridor. "So let's wait."
其实，我挺惊讶你会带谁来这里。等门开了就知道了。" 立子倚着走廊的墙壁，"那就等等看吧。

More minutes passed. Ritsuko seemed content to just stay where she was, staring at the panel showing the elevator descending through the floors, while Misato was on edge, headache steadily pulsing away inside her skull. The flash drive in her jacket pocket felt like it was burning a hole straight through the lining.
时间又悄然流逝了几分钟。律子似乎安于现状，目光紧锁在显示电梯逐层下降的面板上，而美里却心神不宁，头痛如潮水般一波波袭来。她夹克口袋中的闪存盘仿佛带着灼热，直透衬里。

The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Misato looked over to see that the elevator car was empty... seemingly. Ritsuko sighed. "Come on out, we know you're in there."
电梯发出叮的一声，门随之开启。碇真嗣望向电梯内，看似空无一人。葛城美里叹了口气，说道：“出来吧，我们知道你在里面。”

Hesitantly, a certain young redhead poked her head around the corner from where she had likely been hoping to hide. Seeing the two women staring back at her, she glared at them as if it was their fault, then stomped over to them.
一位红发少女犹豫地从她本想藏身的角落探出头，发现两位女士正注视着她，便瞪了她们一眼，似乎在责怪她们，随后气冲冲地走了过去。

"...I can't say I was expecting you," Ritsuko remarked. She glanced questioningly at Misato.
"...真没想到你会来," 律子说着，疑惑地瞥了美里一眼。

"Rei was their friend and fellow pilot, she deserves to know as well." said Misato, giving Ritsuko a look that dared her to find some issue with her explanation.
"Rei 既是他们的朋友也是同僚飞行员，她同样有权知道。" Misato 说道，目光锐利地看向 Ritsuko，似乎在挑衅她能否找出解释中的破绽。

Surprisingly, Ritsuko simply shrugged. "Fine with me. She should at least understand the concept of operational security."
出乎意料，律子只是淡淡地耸了耸肩。“我倒觉得没什么。她至少得明白操作安全的重要性。”

"Misato? Doctor?" Asuka folded her arms and alternated her gaze between them. "Mind telling me what's happening?"
Misato？医生？" 明日香交叉双臂，目光在两人之间来回移动。"能告诉我发生了什么吗？

"As I said to Misato, it'll be easier just to show you," replied Ritsuko. She took one step down the corridor then stopped, glancing over her shoulder. "Last chance to head back. I can easily arrange things so this never happened." Misato and Asuka looked at each other for a moment, then back at her. Neither made a move towards the elevator. Ritsuko shrugged again. "Just making sure. There's no going back after this."
正如我之前对碇真嗣说的，直接展示给你看会更直观。" 丽莎回应着，迈步走向走廊，却又突然停下，回头望了一眼。"这是你们最后一次选择回头的机会。我完全可以安排，让这一切仿佛从未发生。" 碇真嗣和明日香相视片刻，随后目光再次投向她，却都未向电梯迈出一步。丽莎再次耸肩，"只是确认一下。一旦跨过这个点，就无法回头了。

The three of them headed towards the door, which quietly opened when Doctor Akagi waved her tablet at the panel next to it. The room on the other side of the door was almost pitch black, with only a control panel and some kind of tube visible from the corridor. Doctor Akagi strode into the room, with Misato on her heels; Asuka, on the other hand, proceeded much more cautiously.
三人一同走向门口，赤木博士对着旁边的控制面板挥动平板，门便无声地打开了。门后的房间昏暗至极，走廊上仅能隐约看到一个控制面板和一根管道。赤木博士毫不犹豫地步入房间，葛城紧跟其后；相比之下，明日香则小心翼翼地前行。

"Misato, you wanted to know what the deal with Rei is," said Doctor Akagi as she reached the control panel. She held a hand over a button. "You, and you as well Pilot Soryu, most likely have been wondering for some time why she is how she is."
Misato，你想了解绫波的情况，"赤木博士说着走向控制台，一只手悬停在按钮上方。"你，还有你，明日香驾驶员，或许早已对她的特别之处感到好奇。

"Wait, this is about Rei?" Asuka interjected.
"等等，这是在说绫吗？" 明日香突然插话。

Misato nodded grimly. "My dear friend Ritsuko here told me that she managed to survive her Eva self-destructing."
碇真嗣神情严肃地点了点头。“我亲爱的朋友葛城美里告诉我，她在自己的 Eva 自毁中幸存了下来。”

"Rei's alive?!" Relief filled Asuka's chest, but it was quickly tempered by a single burning question. "...How?!"
绫波还活着?!" 阿苏卡心中涌起一阵宽慰，但随即被一个炽热的问题所冲淡。"...这怎么可能?!

"Well Ritsuko started off explaining that to me by trying to lie directly to my face," Misato replied, side-eyeing Doctor Akagi. "I, of course, called bullshit on that, and now we're here."
起初，律子试图当面撒谎来向我解释，" 惣流回答，同时侧目看了看赤木博士。"我自然没买账，于是我们就来到了这里。

"And for what it's worth," said Doctor Akagi. "I'm sorry for what you're about to see." She pressed the button, light flooded the room, and Misato and Asuka were stunned into complete silence as they beheld the sight before them.
"不管怎样，"阿卡吉医生说，"对于你们即将目睹的，我深表歉意。"她按下按钮，房间立刻被光线填满，美里和明日香面对眼前的景象，震惊得哑口无言。

A massive aquarium tank, like something from a zoo, occupied half of the room. It was filled with what looked to be LCL, and swimming around inside the tank were dozens of naked young girls. Asuka slapped a hand over her mouth in horror when she realised who they resembled.
房间的一半被一个巨大的水族箱占据，其规模堪比动物园中的展品。箱内注满了类似 LCL 的液体，数十名裸体少女在其中畅游。阿苏卡意识到她们与某人相似时，惊恐地用手捂住了自己的嘴。

Each and every one of them was the spitting image of Rei.
他们每一个人都和绫长得一模一样。

"W-what the hell is this?!" Asuka shouted, reverting to German in pure shock.
"这究竟是什么鬼东西?!" 明日香惊叫起来，震惊中本能地切换回了德语。

"Ritsuko! What have you- what is NERV doing?!" exclaimed Misato, one hand reaching under her jacket.
"律子！你到底做了什么——NERV 在搞什么名堂?!" Misato 惊呼着，一只手探入夹克内。

Doctor Akagi didn't respond for a long time, staring at the tank full of Rei clones. They appeared mindlessly happy, smiling as they idly swam or floated through the LCL; even bumping into each other didn't appear to register to them at all.
赤木医生久久未作声，目光紧锁在满是绫波克隆体的培养槽上。她们显得毫无心机地快乐，面带微笑，在 LCL 中悠然自得地游弋或漂浮；即便相互碰撞，也似乎全然不觉。

"This... is the truth of Rei Ayanami," she finally said, not turning around. "Just one clone among many, replaceable at any time. The only difference between these ones and the one upstairs... is that these ones are soulless. The Ayanami that you knew was the one that had a soul, up until she sacrificed herself. Then the soul drifted back down here, where it was placed into another shell. We prepared the new host, bandaged it up, and sent it to the medical ward to try and keep the charade going."
这就是绫波丽的真相，"她终于开口，背对着我。"她不过是众多克隆体之一，随时可被替代。这些克隆体与楼上那个唯一的不同...在于它们没有灵魂。你认识的绫波丽，是拥有灵魂的那一个，直到她自我牺牲。随后，灵魂回归此处，被植入新的躯体。我们为新躯体做好准备，包扎妥当，送往医疗室，继续维持这场骗局。

"But why?" Misato pressed. "Why do these clones exist?!"
但究竟是为什么呢？" 碇真嗣紧追不舍。"这些克隆体存在的意义是什么？

"Disposable Eva pilots," Asuka spat. "I remember something Re-..." She paused, then shook her head in frustration. "Something she said a while ago: 'If I die, I can be replaced.' Shinji and I didn't understand what she meant at the time, but... seeing this..."
‘一次性 Eva 驾驶员’，明日香不屑地说。‘我记得丽以前说过...’她突然停住，随后懊恼地摇头。‘她曾言：‘我若死去，自有人替。’那时我和真嗣都未能领会其意，然而...目睹此景...’

Doctor Akagi nodded. "That is part of who she really is. A big part, yes, but not the full story." She turned around to look at Misato, who glared back with gritted teeth. "I'm sure I don't need to remind you of what's further down from here? A certain... white giant?"
赤木医生点头道：“那确实是她真实的一部分，很重要的一部分，但并非全部。”她转过身，面对紧咬牙关回视的 Misato。“我想我不必提醒你，这下面还有什么吧？那个……白色巨人？”

Misato frowned. Sweat was beading on her forehead and her arms were shaking. "What do you mean? What could Adam possibly have to do with Rei?"
美里眉头紧锁，额头渗出汗珠，手臂微微颤抖。"你这话什么意思？亚当和绫波能有什么关联？"

"...Adam?" Asuka echoed, her hands clenched tightly at her sides.
"...亚当？" 明日香跟着说，双手紧握在身旁。

"Adam?" Doctor Akagi also repeated. "Who told you that was Adam?" She stopped, blinked a few times, then sighed. "Damnit, Kaji. I thought you were wiser than that."
亚当？"阿贺野医生重复道，"谁跟你说那是亚当的？"她顿了顿，眨了眨眼，随后叹息道，"真是的，卡吉，我以为你不会这么轻信。

She rubbed a hand down her face then stared up at the ceiling. "Adam is the First Angel. He is the one that you saw during the Katsuragi Expedition. He is the one responsible for Second Impact... partially." Misato began to speak, but Doctor Akagi raised a hand. "I'm sure you'll soon be finding out about that. Anyway, Adam is not the one down below. That one... is Lilith."
她用手抹了把脸，随后仰头凝视天花板。“亚当是第一使徒，正是你在葛城考察期间所见的那位。他部分地引发了第二次冲击……” 葛城正欲开口，赤木博士却抬手示意。“你很快就会知晓详情。不过，下面那个并非亚当，而是莉莉丝。”

"Adam, the First Angel," said Asuka. "Then I suppose Lilith is the Second Angel. Nobody ever said why the Third Angel was called that."
阿苏卡说：'亚当，即第一使徒。那么，莉莉丝想必就是第二使徒了。至于为何称第三使徒为那样，却从未有人提及。'

"Not many people bothered to ask," said Doctor Akagi. "Any who did were just given the runaround. Yes, Lilith is the Second Angel. We don't know much about-" She cut herself off and peered at Misato. "...Are you alright? You're sweating and shaking a lot now."
很少有人真正去询问，"阿基吉博士说道，"即便有人问起，也只是被随意打发了。没错，莉莉丝是第二使徒。关于她，我们知道的并不多——"她突然中断，关切地看向美里："...你没事吧？你看起来满头大汗，还在颤抖。

"That's not important right now!" Misato's hand came out of her jacket holding her gun. While she pointed it at the ground, she made a point of thumbing the safety off. "Tell us about Rei!"
现在这不重要！" 碇真嗣从夹克中掏出手枪，枪口朝地，同时用拇指拨开保险。"跟我们说说绫波丽的情况！

"Alright, alright, I'll cut right to the chase." Doctor Akagi glanced back at the tank full of clones for a few seconds. "Rei Ayanami is not a mere human. She was created from a fusion of Lilith's DNA and... a certain human woman."
行了，行了，我直奔主题。" 赤木博士回头望向装满克隆体的容器，片刻后说道，"绫波丽并非寻常人类。她是利用莉莉丝的 DNA 与某位人类女性的基因融合而成的产物。

"A human woman..." said Misato. "Who would be crazy enough to offer up their DNA for something?"
一位人类女性..." 碇真嗣说道。"究竟是谁会疯狂到愿意提供自己的 DNA 来做这种事呢？

"Hang on..." Asuka interrupted. Something was jumping up and down in the back of her mind, waving its hands to try and get her attention. She moved closer to the tank, staring curiously at one of the clones as it seemed to notice her. It drifted towards the glass, staring vacantly back as Asuka approached it. She tilted her head to one side, and was only mildly surprised when the clone did the same.
"等等..."飞鸟突然插话。她脑海中有个念头在跳跃，急切地挥手想要吸引她的注意。她靠近水箱，好奇地注视着其中一个克隆体，它似乎察觉到了她的存在。克隆体缓缓移向玻璃，空洞地回望着接近的飞鸟。她侧了侧头，当克隆体也做出相同动作时，她只是稍感意外。

And then something almost audibly went 'click' in her head.
紧接着，她的脑海里仿佛清晰地响起了“咔哒”一声。

She had seen this face just recently, and not because it was a clone of her fellow pilot. In fact, the face bore an uncanny likeness to...
她最近才见过这张脸，并非因为它是她同伴飞行员的复制品。实际上，这张脸与...有着不可思议的相似。

"Yui Ikari?!" Asuka exclaimed, rounding on Doctor Akagi.
"绫波唯？！" 明日香惊呼一声，转身面向赤木博士。

Doctor Akagi gave a small cough. "I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised that you worked it out," she remarked. "I did suspect there would be some memory sharing happening between you and the Third Child. Yes, Rei's human half came from Yui Ikari, Shinji's mother."
赤木医生轻咳一声：“看来你已经猜到了，我并不意外。我之前就怀疑你和第三适格者之间存在记忆共享。没错，绫波的人类基因源自碇唯，也就是真嗣的母亲。”

"Didn't she die back during the first Contact Experiment with Unit-01?" asked Misato. "Wait... Rei's file said she was... born in 2001."
她不是在第一次与 Unit-01 接触实验时就去世了吗？" 碇真嗣疑惑地问。"等等...绫波的资料上写着她是...2001 年出生的。

"A lie," said Doctor Akagi. "Rei was actually born after Yui's death. Tell me, Asuka. How much do you actually know of Shinji's mother?"
阿卡吉博士说：'这是个谎言。'实际上，绫是在结衣去世后才出生的。明日香，你到底对真嗣的母亲了解多少呢？

Asuka narrowed her eyes. "I know what happened." Misato stared at Asuka, her expression clearly stating that she wanted to know too, so she sighed and began to fill her in. "Yui Ikari was the test pilot for Unit-01's Contact Experiment. During the test the Eva... absorbed her. She's now essentially the core of Unit-01, and the reason why the Eva's so picky about anyone besides Shinji -or me- piloting it. The same is true of my mother and Unit-02, although in that case... my mother was simply rendered insane by the test."
明日香眯起眼睛，说道：“我知道发生了什么。”美里紧盯着她，显然也想了解详情，于是叹了口气，开始解释。“碇唯曾是零号机接触实验的试飞员。实验中，零号机...将她吸收了。她现在成了零号机的核心，这也是为何除了真嗣和我，零号机不愿被他人驾驶。同样的事也发生在我母亲和二号机上，只不过在那次...我母亲被实验逼疯了。”

Asuka glared at Doctor Akagi. "And I think NERV had a hand in ensuring that happened."
明日香怒视着赤木博士：“我怀疑 NERV 也插手促成了这件事。”

Doctor Akagi put her hands up. "That was not something I knew about until afterwards. Anyway, yes, Yui Ikari was absorbed by Unit-01. Commander Ikari was rather... upset at that and tried to recover her. Unfortunately nothing worked, almost like what happened with you, Asuka. The only thing that NERV got was genetic material that ended up being used for... well... this." She indicated the tank full of clones.
医生阿卡吉举起双手说道：“那件事我确实是事后才知晓的。没错，碇唯被 Unit-01 吞噬了。碇司令对此感到极度悲痛，竭力想要救回她。可惜一切努力都徒劳无功，与你，明日香的遭遇如出一辙。NERV 仅获得的遗传物质，最终被用于……嗯……制造这些。”她指向装满克隆体的容器。

Out of the corner of her eye, Asuka noticed Misato rapidly shake her head and bring up a hand to rub at her eyes. She looked to be only a step away from falling over. "This is ridiculous!" Misato shouted. "Why is this all happening?! What does NERV hope to gain by committing these kinds of atrocities?!"
明日香从眼角余光中察觉到美里猛地摇头，并举手揉眼，似乎差点就要跌倒。“这太荒唐了！”美里大声质问，“这一切为何会发生？！NERV 究竟想通过这些暴行得到什么？！”

Doctor Akagi began to slowly back away from the control panel towards some kind of alcove to one side of the tank. "Misato, calm down," she said. "Withdrawal's hitting you hard now. Maybe you should go and rest."
医生阿卡吉缓缓从控制台退向水箱旁的一个凹室，说道：“Misato，冷静点，你现在戒断反应很强烈，或许该去休息一下。”

"You-" Misato suddenly stopped, her eyes widening as she stared at the tank. Asuka turned to check, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. She was therefore confused when Misato brought her gun up to aim at the tank and immediately got well out of the woman's line of fire. Ritsuko spun around and began to run towards the alcove just as Misato pulled the trigger, screaming in fear as she wildly emptied the magazine.
"你-" Misato 突然止步，双眼圆睁，紧盯着坦克。Asuka 回头查看，却未见异常。因此，当 Misato 举枪对准坦克并迅速避开其射击线时，Asuka 感到不解。就在此时，Ritsuko 转身奔向壁龛，而 Misato 扣动扳机，惊恐地尖叫着将弹匣中的子弹尽数射出。

The tank's glass shattered on the first shot. Its contents flooded out, sending LCL and clones rushing to all corners of the room. Asuka was knocked over by the rushing liquid and was instantly soaked from head to toe. When the tide stopped, she wiped the LCL out of her eyes and rolled to the side to push herself back up, only to freeze as she came face to face with one of the clones laying on the ground next to her. When the clone tilted its head at her, Asuka shrieked and scrambled back to her feet, hindered by the slippery floor.
第一枪响，坦克的观察窗应声碎裂，内部液体与克隆体如洪水般涌向房间各处。明日香被这股洪流击倒，全身湿透。待水势平息，她抹去眼角的 LCL，翻身欲起，却猛然停住，因为一个克隆体正躺在她身旁。克隆体向她歪了歪头，明日香惊叫一声，挣扎着站起，但湿滑的地面让她步履蹒跚。

"Shit, shit, shit!" Doctor Akagi cursed, returning at almost a sprint with a needle in her hand. Misato was still pulling the trigger of her gun even as it clicked at her, and didn't notice the syringe when it jabbed into her arm. Even as Misato began to stagger back and forth, she continued trying to fire her weapon right up until she collapsed to the ground.
"糟糕，糟糕，糟糕！" 阿卡吉医生边咒骂边疾跑回来，手里紧握着一根针。尽管手中的枪已经空响，三笠依旧不停地扣动扳机，丝毫未觉针头已刺入她的手臂。她摇摇欲坠，却仍坚持试图开枪，直至力竭倒地。

Doctor Akagi knelt over Misato, checking that her friend was still breathing before removing the gun from her hands and stowing it in a pocket of her labcoat. She stood up, took one look at the carnage, and put her hands over her face. "Fuck, Ikari's going to kill me..."
医生安贺跪在美里身旁，确认她还有呼吸后，轻轻地从她手中取走枪，放入自己实验服的口袋中。她站起身来，目睹四周的混乱，不禁双手掩面。“完了，碇司令非杀了我不可……”

Asuka tiptoed through the LCL, over and around the clones who were lazily flopping and rolling about, until she reached the two women. "What the hell was that all about?!" she exclaimed, trying to hide her shock behind anger.
明日香蹑手蹑脚地穿行于 LCL 之中，绕开那些懒散扑腾、翻滚的克隆体，直至来到两位女士跟前。“这究竟是怎么一回事？！”她怒斥道，试图以愤怒掩饰内心的震惊。

Peering at Asuka through her fingers, Doctor Akagi groaned and said, "I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I believe Misato was one of the unfortunate few who got one of the rare symptoms of alcohol withdrawal: hallucinations. And considering where we are..."
赤木医生透过指缝窥视着明日香，叹息道：“我不敢打包票，但我觉得真嗣的母亲可能是少数不幸经历了酒精戒断罕见症状的人之一，即幻觉。再看看我们现在的处境……”

Asuka looked around at the clones. "...She thought they were coming for her or something?"
明日香环视着周围的克隆体，心想：“难道她以为这些克隆体是冲着她来的？”

"Probably." Doctor Akagi shrugged and let her hands flop back to her sides. "Damnit. At least this happened after we decanted a new clone, but... things are going to be hell for Misato and I now." She stared at Asuka and sarcastically added, "Is your curiosity sated now?"
大概吧。"阿卡吉医生耸耸肩，双手颓然垂下。"真倒霉。好在这是在新克隆体出舱后发生的，不过...我和美里接下来可有得受了。"她看着明日香，语气中带着讽刺，"这下你满意了吧？

Asuka stared right back. "If anything, this has just given me further questions. And by the way, you know I'm going to share all this with Shinji, right?"
明日香毫不回避地回望。“说实在的，这反而让我心中疑问更多了。对了，你清楚我会把这一切都告诉真嗣的吧？”

"Wouldn't he already know? The two of you share memories after all."
他不是应该早就知道了吗？你们俩可是共享记忆的。

"No, that's not how it works!" Asuka spat. "First of all, Shinji's still unconscious. Secondly, the link isn't permanent. And thirdly, we only sense what the other person does at the moment it happens."
不，事情不是这样运作的！" 明日香反驳说，"首先，真嗣现在还处于昏迷状态。其次，我们之间的链接并非永久性的。最后，我们只能感知到对方那一刻正在经历的事情。

Doctor Akagi blinked several times. "Well, that is... intriguing. I wish I could study you two further but I suppose I need to try and sort this mess out. Starting with Misato."
医生阿卡吉眨了眨眼，说道：“嗯，这确实挺有意思的。真希望能对你们俩做更深入的研究，不过眼下我得先处理这个麻烦事。就从三佐开始吧。”

Together, Asuka and Doctor Akagi somehow managed to awkwardly drag Misato back to the elevator. After a quiet return to the medical ward, they passed her off to some orderlies that Doctor Akagi had contacted to receive Misato.
明日香和赤木博士合力，尴尬地拖着葛城美里回到电梯。静默中返回医疗区后，赤木博士联系的护理人员接手了美里。

With Misato being wheeled away -cuffed to the bed- and Doctor Akagi heading back down to that abominable place, Asuka was left on her own. With nothing to do and nowhere else to go, she headed back to Shinji's room where she was dismayed to see that he still hadn't woken up. She slumped back in the chair next to the bed and stared at him for a while, hoping for him to hurry up and regain consciousness.
美里被铐在床上推走，赤木博士又回到了那个阴森的地方，留下明日香孤零零一人。她无事可做，无处可去，便回到了真嗣的房间，却失望地发现他依旧未醒。她沮丧地坐回床边的椅子，目不转睛地望着他，期盼他能尽快苏醒。

Asuka blinked, and suddenly she was staring at its face again, grinning back at her. She leapt out of the chair and backed up against the wall, only to realise it was just her imagination; it was still Shinji in that bed, not a freakish naked half-clone of his mother. Cautiously, she returned to the chair and laid her head down on the bed, her hands tightly gripping the sheets.
明日香眨了眨眼，忽然又与那张脸四目相对，它正朝她咧嘴笑。她猛地从椅子上跳起，退到墙边，这才意识到只是自己的幻觉；床上躺着的仍是真嗣，并非他母亲那诡异的半裸克隆体。她小心翼翼地回到椅子上，将头枕在床上，双手紧抓着床单。

"You need to wake up soon, Shinji," she quietly said. "I need you by my-... need you backing me up again..."
真嗣，你得快点醒来，"她轻声说道，"我需要你在我身边...需要你再次支持我...

Gendo looked around at the Dummy Plug Plant, taking in the mess. The tank was smashed, its contents all over the floor meaning that he had to be careful with his steps, and the clones were already beginning to degrade. Even if there was somewhere else to put them, they were no longer viable.
源渡环视着模拟插入栓工厂，眼前一片混乱。储罐破碎，液体溅满地面，他不得不小心翼翼地移动脚步，而那些克隆体已经开始腐坏。即便有其他地方可以安置，它们也已无法存活。

At least one had been activated before this disaster.
至少有一项在灾难发生前已经启动。

"This is my fault sir," said Ritsuko from behind him. "I shouldn't have brought Misato down here."
先生，这是我的过失，" 理津子在他身后说，"我不该带三乡来这里。

Gendo looked at one of the clones, still smiling and rolling on the ground even as its skin was sloughing off. "A mistake, certainly," he remarked. "But at this stage, it is one we can handle. With the loss of Unit-00, there is little to no risk of losing Rei before the time comes." He turned away as the clone's eyes began to cloud over. "There is no point trying to clean this up; it would take you too long. We'll shut everything off and lock the floor down. Soon it won't matter anymore anyway."
源渡注视着其中一个克隆体，它尽管皮肤剥落，却依旧面带微笑，在地上翻滚。“这确实是个失误，”他评论道，“但目前阶段，我们尚能应对。零号机的损失意味着在关键时刻之前，我们几乎不会失去绫波。”他转身离开，克隆体的双眼逐渐失去光泽。“无需费力清理现场，那太耗时了。我们将切断所有设备，封锁这一层。不久后，这一切都将无关紧要。”

"...Yes sir," said Ritsuko. She didn't move, looking somewhat hesitant.
"...是的，先生，" 里津子说道，她没有移动，显得有些迟疑。

"What is it, Doctor?" 医生，这是什么？

"Sir, it's just..." She glanced around at the room. "That's it? Shut down and lock up? My decision led to this and you're just... letting it go?"
先生，就这样吗……" 她环视四周，"这就完了？关掉并锁上门？我的决定造成了这一切，您就……就这么放下了？

"Would you prefer I have you confined to the brig instead of ensuring the MAGI are prepared for what will soon come our way?"
您是希望我让您待在禁闭室，还是确保 MAGI 为即将面临的挑战做好准备？

"Well, no, but..." 嗯，不是的，但是...

Gendo walked over to the console in the middle of the room and began to initiate the shutdown sequence. "Major Katsuragi is currently confined to a hospital bed. When she is recovered she will continue the late Special Inspector's mission, and she will uncover SEELE's machinations before anything that will impede us. She will want to dig further into that so she has as much proof as possible before attempting to deliver it. As for the Second Child, she only has Katsuragi and the Third Child to turn to now, especially since she is effectively on permanent standby and cannot easily leave the Geofront."
源渡走向房间中央的控制台，启动了关闭程序。"葛城少校现正住院治疗。一旦康复，她将继续已故特别监察官的使命，揭露 SEELE 的阴谋，确保我们不受阻碍。她会深入挖掘，确保在提交证据前掌握充分证据。至于第二适格者，她如今只能依赖葛城和第三适格者，尤其是她处于永久待命状态，难以离开 Geofront。"

Ritsuko stepped up beside him. "So you're saying that since neither of them can talk about what happened here, it just... doesn't matter?"
律子走到他身旁，问道：“你的意思是，既然他们俩都无法提及这里发生的事，这件事就……无关紧要了？”

"Essentially, yes." 基本上，没错。

Around them, a hum that had just barely been on the edge of hearing began to die down. Gendo headed for the door as the overhead lights turned off one by one. Out in the corridor he glanced at Ritsuko, who nodded and used the panel beside the door to lock it.
四周，那刚刚勉强能听见的嗡嗡声开始消退。源堂走向门口，头顶的灯光依次熄灭。到了走廊，他看了眼律子，她点头并用门边的控制面板将门锁上。

"We have another, much more immediate concern too," said Ritsuko as they proceeded towards the elevator.
"我们还有另一个，更为迫切的担忧，" 丽萨子说着，一同走向电梯。

"Yes, the Fourth," Gendo replied. "Supposedly reawakened after the biomass died out or was successfully fought off by his immune system."
是的，第四个，" 源渡回答说，"据称是在生物量消亡或被其免疫系统成功击退后再次觉醒。

"I don't believe either of those for a second," Ritsuko remarked. "This is an Angel that managed to perfectly hide inside Unit-03 and attack at the worst possible moment. If that really is the Aida boy in there, I'll eat my damn tablet." As the elevator headed back up to Central Dogma, she studied the device in question, tapping out a few commands to change its view to that of the security camera in the quarantine chamber. "Honestly, I want to just hit the button and purge the room. We're the only ones who know about this aside from the men on watch duty. Better to euthanize him as an Angel than risk it breaking free at the worst moment again."
我对此毫不相信，" 律子断言。"这天使竟能完美藏身于零号机内，在最不利的时刻发起攻击。如果那里面真的是绫波家的孩子，我宁愿把我的平板电脑吃掉。" 电梯上升至中央教条时，她专注地操作着设备，切换到隔离室的监控画面。"说实话，我真想直接启动净化程序。除了值班人员，只有我们知晓此事。与其冒险让他在关键时刻再次逃脱，不如将其安乐死。

"Then why haven't you?" Gendo asked, already knowing the answer.
"那你为何还没行动？" 源堂问，心中其实已有答案。

"Well officially, it's your decision to make, not mine. Really though..." Ritsuko's thumb hovered over the button that would initiate an emergency purge of the quarantine room. Whoever was currently on duty there would experience a few brief seconds of pain before dying along with the Fourth Child as the entire chamber was cleansed with fire. "...Part of me doesn't want to kill a kid just for being unlucky."
从官方角度讲，这是你的决定，与我无关。但实际上……" 律子的拇指悬停在那个能启动隔离室紧急清除的按钮上。当时值班的人将经历短暂痛苦，随后与第四适格者一同在烈焰中被彻底净化。"……我心底里并不愿意仅仅因为命运不济就夺走一个孩子的生命。

"And, of course, there is the slim chance that he has managed to fight off the Angel one way or another."
当然，也存在一种微乎其微的可能性，他设法以某种方式击退了天使。

Ritsuko nodded absently, still staring at the tablet. "In which case we could examine him and see what we can learn."
律子心不在焉地点头，目光依旧停留在平板电脑上。"这样的话，我们不妨对他进行检查，看看能有什么发现。"

Gendo thought for a moment. It would be prudent to neutralise the Fourth Child now, before there was a risk of him being an Angel and breaking free. On the other hand... things were starting to draw to a close. He did not want to destroy a potential piece just on a suspicion. "For now, my decision is that we simply observe," he finally said. "Analyse the Fourth Child as thoroughly as you can without entering the chamber. Do not inform anybody of his awakening yet. There will be little point in it if it turns out he is an Angel."
源渡沉思片刻。此刻中止第四适格者的行动颇为明智，以防他化作使徒挣脱控制。然而...局势正趋向尾声。他不愿仅凭猜疑便舍弃一枚潜在的棋子。“眼下，我决定静观其变，”他最终开口。“在不进入房间的前提下，尽可能深入地分析第四适格者。暂且不要向任何人透露他的觉醒。若他果真为使徒，此举亦无济于事。”

"Of course," Ritsuko agreed. "That would tank morale even further among the pilots and command staff." The elevator opened on her floor. She stepped out and turned to Gendo. "I'll do what I can to find out one way or the other, but I don't expect to get an answer in the next day or two."
当然，" 律子表示同意。"那无疑会进一步削弱飞行员和指挥团队的士气。" 电梯门在她所在楼层打开，她迈步走出，转向源堂说道："我会尽力去查个水落石出，但别指望一两天内就有结果。

"Of course." Gendo stared at her. "Now then, consider this a warning. Nothing will stand in the way of the scenario. Not Katsuragi, not SEELE, not you. Consider your future actions carefully." He pressed the button to close the elevator doors, leaving Ritsuko in the corridor as the elevator continued upwards.
"当然。"源渡凝视着她。"那么，就当这是警告吧。任何事物都无法阻挡剧本的推进。无论是葛城，SEELE，还是你。请仔细斟酌你未来的行动。"他按下按钮，电梯门缓缓关闭，留下律子独自在走廊，电梯继续向上升去。

Upon returning to his office, Gendo closed the door and leaned against it. He removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes, trying to banish the sight of her face slowly disintegrating, repeated a dozen times over. The deathly chill in his chest was slowly growing stronger every day, but very soon he would be reunited with Yui. Whether or not that would dispel the chill, heal his shredded soul, it didn't matter. He would endure anything if it meant being with her again.
回到办公室，源堂关上门，背靠着门。他摘下眼镜，揉了揉眼睛，试图抹去脑海中她面容逐渐消散的画面，这一幕反复出现。他胸中的寒意日益加剧，但很快他将与唯重逢。无论这能否驱散寒意，治愈他破碎的心灵，都已不再重要。只要能再次与她相聚，他甘愿承受一切。

At this point it was no longer a surprise to Shinji whenever he woke up in NERV's hospital with no memory of being brought there. What was a surprise was just how much pain his entire body was in. It was as if somebody had worked him over with a metal baseball bat while taking just enough care not to break any bones. Lifting his head off the pillow was out of the question; all he accomplished was getting a sledgehammer in the back of his skull.
此刻，真嗣醒来发现自己躺在 NERV 的医院里，对此已不再感到意外，因为他已经记不清自己是如何被送来的。真正让他吃惊的是全身的剧痛。仿佛有人用金属棒球棒狠狠地打了他一顿，却又小心翼翼地没有打断任何骨头。他试图抬头，却只感到后脑勺像是被重锤猛击。

At least, that was what it felt like.
至少，当时的感觉就是这样。

Thankfully his eyes didn't hurt -much- and eventually he was able to crack them open to look up at the sterile white ceiling above him. He tried to grumble something about being back here again, but all that came out of his mouth was a small groan. A worried face topped by red hair almost instantly entered his field of vision.
幸好他的眼睛没有太疼，最后他终于睁开眼，望向头顶那片洁白无瑕的天花板。他本想抱怨几句又回到这里，可嘴里只发出了一声微弱的呻吟。一个红发下带着忧虑的面孔几乎立刻映入他的眼帘。

"Shinji?!" said Asuka, quickly looking him over. He tried to respond but could only get another groan out. "Blink twice if you can see and hear me."
真嗣？！" 阿苏卡喊道，急忙审视着他。他想要回答，却只能再次发出呻吟。"能看见我并听见我说话的话，就眨两下眼。

Oh good. Something he could actually do. Shinji blinked twice.
哦，太好了。总算有件事是他能做的。真嗣眨了眨眼。

Asuka sighed in relief. "Damnit, don't worry m- us like that again. You've been out for two days. And on top of that..." She paused, looking away for a moment. "Just to make sure, you remember everything that happened in the last battle right?"
明日香如释重负地叹了口气。“真是的，别再这样吓我们了。你已经昏迷两天了。还有……”她顿了顿，目光转向别处。“只是确认一下，上一场战斗的经过你都记得吧？”

Shinji checked his memories. Nothing seemed to be missing; they had fought a giant double helix Angel, it had attacked him specifically, and then...
真嗣审视了自己的记忆，发现并无缺失：他们曾对抗一个庞大的双螺旋形态天使，那天使特意向他发起了攻击，之后...

Apparently his expression had changed as he remembered, because Asuka grimaced and nodded. "Yeah. Rei sacrificed herself. But... I learned some things not long ago about her. Stuff NERV kept secret for a long time, but you of all people deserve to know." Her face turned dark and somewhat angry. "Do you want to hear it now?"
显然，他的表情因为回忆而有所改变，明日香皱眉点头说：“没错，绫波牺牲了自己。不过……不久前我了解到了一些关于她的秘密。这些是 NERV 一直隐瞒的，但你是最应该知道的人。”她的脸色变得阴沉，带着几分怒气。“你现在想听吗？”

Two blinks, almost before she could finish talking.
她话音未落，几乎同时眨了两下眼。

"Alright then." Asuka rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. "Ugh. Okay, everything I'm about to say is true. I wouldn't make this crap up even as a joke. So, first of all... Rei isn't really dead."
那好，听着。" 明日香用手掌根部揉了揉眼睛。"呃，行吧，我接下来要说的都是真的。我绝不会拿这种事开玩笑。首先... 绫波其实并没有死。

Shinji stared at her in shock, unable to believe Asuka's words despite her having just promised to speak the truth. If it wasn't for the fact that he could barely feel anything besides pain in his body, he would have sat bolt upright.
真嗣震惊地凝视着她，尽管明日香刚承诺会说实话，他仍难以置信。若非身体除了疼痛别无他感，他定会猛然坐起。

"The how is complicated," Asuka continued. "And by that I mean... hell, there's no easy way to say this... Rei is a cloned person. She did actually die, but then NERV resurrected her. In a manner of speaking. Right now she's in another part of the hospital, bandaged up to look like she just barely survived."
这个过程颇为复杂，" 明日香接着说，"我的意思是...哎，真不知道怎么简单地说...绫波其实是克隆人。她确实死过一次，但 NERV 又让她复活了。可以这么说。现在她在医院的另一部分，全身裹着绷带，看起来像是险些丧命。

Shinji cursed his body for refusing to respond. The best he could manage was some vague twitching of his extremities. Asuka saw this and, after hovering a hand over his, gingerly latched onto it.
真嗣对自己的身体无法动弹感到愤怒，仅能勉强让四肢微微抽动。明日香目睹此景，先是将手悬停在他的手上方，随后轻柔地握住了他的手。

"I also found out why she looks the way she does. Half of her DNA comes from an Angel NERV has locked up in the basement." Asuka paused, squeezing Shinji's hand as he again tried to move. "And the other half is... your mother."
我还弄清楚了她为何是这副模样。她一半的 DNA 源自 NERV 囚禁在地下室的一位天使。" 明日香顿了顿，紧握住试图再次动弹的绫波的手。"至于另一半，则是...你的母亲。

Pain flared in Shinji's body as he heard a scream fill the room. It took him a few seconds to realise he had actually managed to sit up, and it was him doing the screaming. He slammed his jaw shut, took several deep breaths, and stared at Asuka.
真嗣感到身体一阵剧痛，突然间，一声尖叫响彻整个房间。几秒后，他才反应过来，原来是自己坐起身来，尖叫声也是他发出的。他急忙闭上嘴，深呼吸几次，目光紧锁在明日香身上。

Thankfully she seemed to know what he was thinking, despite a lack of synchronisation. "I know it sounds incredible, but it all makes sense now. When we saw each other's memories, I was able to see your mother's face, and she looked almost exactly like you andRei. And now, after what I've learned, when I look at you I can see some of Rei's face in yours."
幸好，她似乎能洞悉他的心思，尽管两人并未完全同步。"我知道这听起来很不可思议，但现在一切都明了了。当我们共享彼此的记忆时，我看到了你母亲的面容，她几乎和你及 Rei 如出一辙。如今，在我所知的基础上，当我凝视你时，我能在你脸上捕捉到 Rei 的轮廓。"

Was Rei... his mother? What did this mean for them? Did this... new Rei still remember everything? What if she had forgotten everything and their friendship no longer existed? And what about his actual mother, entombed within Unit-01?
Rei 真的是他的母亲吗？这对他们意味着什么？这个新生的 Rei 是否还记得过往的一切？万一她已忘却所有，他们的友谊是否也随之消逝？而他真正的母亲，又该如何面对被封印在 Unit-01 中的现实？

"Shinji?" 真嗣吗？

What was NERV... what was his father doing?!
NERV 究竟是什么...他的父亲到底在做什么？！

"Shinji!" 真嗣！

A slap on the back of his head knocked Shinji out of his thoughts. He gingerly turned his head to look at Asuka.
后脑勺上的一巴掌让真嗣从思绪中回过神来。他谨慎地转头望向明日香。

"You were staring off into space for a while there," she said unapologetically. "Had to make sure you were still alright."
你刚才发呆了好一阵子，"她坦然地说，"我得确认你没事。

Shinji shakily nodded, then glanced at the door leading out of the room. He wanted nothing more than to-
真嗣颤巍巍地点了点头，随即望向通往室外的门。他此刻只想尽快逃离。

"You want to go see her, don't you?"
你是不是想去看她？

Another nod, a little more sure this time. The pain finally seemed to be starting to fade away; now he could at least start to turn his head around.
再次点头，这次多了几分确定。疼痛终于开始缓解；现在他至少能稍微转动一下头部了。

Asuka sighed. "I'm not going to say you shouldn't. What I will say is this: can you even make it there right now?" Shinji stared at her. "Of course, stupid question," she said with a small chuckle. "Fine, I'll make sure you get there and back, but afterwards you're going to damn well rest and recover. Understood?"
明日香叹了口气。“我不会阻止你。但我想问：你现在能去得了吗？”真嗣看着她。“当然，问了个傻问题，”她轻笑一声。“行，我会保证你安全来回，但之后你必须好好休息恢复。听清楚了吗？”

"Y's, 'suka," Shinji mumbled, feeling the corners of his mouth tilt upwards.
"Y 的，'喜欢你'," 真嗣低声说着，嘴角不由自主地上扬。

"Good." Asuka stood up, standing next to the bed. "If you don't, I'll kick your ass so hard it'll make what that Angel did to you feel like a damn massage."
好的。" 明日香起身，站在床旁。"你要是不照做，我踢你屁股的时候，会让你觉得那使徒的攻击简直像是在享受按摩。

As she removed the bedsheets covering Shinji, he suddenly recoiled in shock as the state of his body became clear. The veins of his body were standing out just as they had done while the Angel was attacking. He gingerly lifted his arms, staring closely at them as he tried to understand what was going on.
她揭开覆盖在真嗣身上的床单，他顿时惊恐地缩回身子，因为他的身体状况一览无余。他身上的血管如同被天使攻击时那般明显凸起。他小心翼翼地抬起双臂，凝视着它们，试图弄清楚究竟发生了什么。

"...Yeah, you don't look great right now," Asuka remarked. "The doctor said you should return to normal in a few days, but he's never seen anything like this. Normally veins like that-" she pointed at his arms and legs, "-would be a sign of something like thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis, but as far as they can tell there's nothing actually wrong with you."
...是啊，你现在看起来确实不太好，"飞鸟评论道。"医生说你过几天应该就能恢复，但他从没见过这种情况。通常这种静脉——"她指向他的手臂和腿部，"——可能是血栓性静脉炎或深静脉血栓的征兆，但他们检查后发现你其实并无大碍。

Shinji tried to speak, but his mouth was dry. Noting this, Asuka picked up a glass of water that had been sitting next to his bed and held it to his lips. He took a few small sips of the water, but some of it simply spilled out of his mouth. Eventually though, he was able to take in enough to let him talk.
真嗣想开口，却感到口干舌燥。明日香察觉到这一点，便拿起他床头的水杯，递到他嘴边。他小心翼翼地抿了几口水，部分水滴顺着嘴角流下。不过，他最终还是喝到了足够的水，得以开口。

"It's... the same as when I was... confronted by the Angel," he murmured. "My veins were sticking out even through my plugsuit. I thought that was just the Angel messing with me."
这感觉……和当初我面对使徒时如出一辙，"他喃喃道，"我的血管透过插入栓服都清晰可见。我曾以为那只是使徒的影响。

Asuka shook her head. "That damn Angel targeted you specifically. I didn't feel a thing, and nothing much happened to Unit-02 besides some damaged armour." She frowned. "Wait a minute... confronted? Did the Angel actually talk to you?!"
明日香摇头道：“那该死的使徒分明是冲着你来的。我毫无察觉，二号机也仅是装甲受损而已。”她眉头紧锁，追问道：“等等... 你说的对峙是什么意思？难道使徒真的跟你对话了？！”

With some effort, and a hand on his back helping to keep him sitting upright, Shinji began to speak of how the Angel had tried to coax him into allowing it to merge with him, then had given up on asking and started demanding. Trying to force itself into him. He wrapped his arms around himself, shivering involuntarily at the memory of how his very being had been violated.
在有人从背后扶持下，真嗣努力坐稳，开始叙述天使如何先是诱导他同意融合，后来索性放弃劝说，转为强硬要求，企图强行侵入他的身体。他双臂紧抱自己，因回想起那种被侵犯的感觉而不禁颤抖。

Seeing his reaction, Asuka immediately put the glass down and put her hands on his shoulders. "It's alright Shinji," she said. "The Angel is dead. You're safe now."
见他如此反应，明日香随即放下玻璃杯，双手轻放在他肩头。“别担心，真嗣，”她安慰道，“使徒已被消灭，你现在安全了。”

The warmth of her hands leeching through the thin material of the hospital gown helped pull Shinji back to the present. He gave her a weak smile of thanks as he let his arms drop back to his sides. "T-thanks Asuka."
她双手透过薄薄的病号服传来的温暖，将真嗣拉回了现实。他向她投去一个虚弱的微笑以示感谢，随后让手臂自然垂下。“谢…谢谢你，明日香。”

Asuka reddened slightly and looked away. "Yeah, don't mention it. Anyway, let's just forget about the Angel completely now. Let's get you up on your feet."
明日香脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，她转开视线说：“嗯，这事就别提了。现在，我们彻底把那个使徒抛到脑后吧。我来帮你站起来。”

With some effort, Shinji found he could actually get out of bed, but his legs quickly became so shaky that he had to lean on her to be able to stay upright for more than a few seconds. She gave no sign of complaint though; instead she seemed infinitely patient as the two of them slowly made their way out of the room and into the corridor. Not a single member of the hospital staff so much as batted an eye at the two teenagers as they made their way through the hospital.
经过一番努力，真嗣发现自己确实能下床了，但双腿很快便颤抖不已，只得倚靠着她才能勉强站立片刻。她并未流露丝毫不悦，反而显得异常耐心，两人缓缓步出房间，步入走廊。医院的工作人员对这对青少年视若无睹，任由他们穿梭于医院之中。

It felt like several hours before she brought them both to a stop in front of a door. The room that she saw Misato and Akagi come out of before they went down the elevator. She hadn't looked inside, because she was more curious as to where they were going, especially since Misato had had a face like thunder.
仿佛过了许久，她才领着两人在门前驻足。这正是她目睹美里和赤木之前从里面走出，随后搭乘电梯下楼的那间房。她并未向内窥探，因为她更关心他们将前往何方，尤其是美里的脸色阴沉得如同暴风雨来临前的天际。

He nodded. It was time for them both to see.
他点头示意。现在该让他们俩都看清楚了。

She opened the door, and they headed in. The room looked almost exactly the same as the one they had come from, and yet there seemed to be an aura of trepidation filling it. The only thing in the room that stood out was that there was a blue-haired girl who was supposedly not the one they both knew, sitting up in bed and staring at the far wall. She had bandages covering half of her face, with some even disappearing under the collar of her hospital gown, and her left arm was in a cast.
她推开门，两人步入室内。这房间与他们刚离开的那间几乎无异，却弥漫着一股莫名的紧张感。唯一不同的是，床上坐着一位蓝发少女，并非他们所熟识的那位，她正凝视着对面的墙壁。她的半张脸被绷带包裹，部分绷带隐没在病号服的领口里，左臂则打着石膏。

Despite their attempts to mentally prepare for this meeting, they found that they were still stunned into silence. Rei continued staring at the wall for a little while, before slowly turning her head towards them. The instant she saw them, her eyes narrowed dangerously.
尽管他们努力在心理上为这次会议做准备，但仍旧震惊得哑口无言。丽继续凝视墙壁片刻，随后缓缓转头望向他们。一见到他们，她的眼神立刻变得锐利而危险。

"What are you?" she coldly asked after a few seconds of glaring at them.
"你是什么人？" 她冷冷地问道，怒视了他们几秒后。

That... was not how they were expecting Rei to greet them.
那... 并非他们预期中丽会用来迎接他们的方式。

"Uh, Rei?" they hesitantly asked together. "Are you alright?"
呃，零？" 他们迟疑地齐声问道，"你没事吧？

Rei looked between them, seemingly puzzled by them talking at the same time. Concern began to creep over them; their fellow pilot was acting like she didn't know who they were. Was it because she was a clone? Did their friendship not exist anymore?
绫在他们之间来回看着，似乎对他们同时说话感到困惑。担忧逐渐在他们心中升起；他们的同伴驾驶员表现得仿佛不认识他们似的。难道是因为她是克隆人？他们的友谊难道已经不复存在了吗？

Rei abruptly got out of bed and strode towards them. "I will ask again. What are you?" she demanded. Her red eyes began to subtly glow. "Answer me, or I will be forced to eliminate you."
零猛地从床上起身，快步逼近他们。“我最后问一遍，你们究竟是什么？”她厉声追问，红眸中隐隐透出光芒。“给我答案，否则我只能将你们抹除。”

### Chapter 45 You Will Destroy Them

"Answer me, or I will be forced to eliminate you."
回答我，不然我只能将你除掉。

Asuka and Shinji stared at Rei. She was acting just like she had months ago, when Asuka had decided to introduce herself to her fellow pilot. Just like back then, Rei was suspicious from the start, saying strange things. This time though, she was also threatening violence. And, of course, there were her eyes, glowing red even through the bandage covering that side of her face, removing any possible lingering doubt in their minds about Rei not being fully human.
明日香和真嗣凝视着绫波。她的举止与数月前如出一辙，那时明日香决定向同为驾驶员的她自我介绍。和那时一样，绫波从一开始就满怀疑虑，说出一些莫名其妙的话。而这次，她甚至威胁要动武。更不用说她的眼睛，即便被绷带遮住了半边脸，那红色的光芒依旧闪烁，彻底打消了他们心中对绫波是否完全为人的疑虑。

Rei raised her hand, palm out towards them. He suddenly remembered the hideous feeling of the Third Angel jamming its energy lance into his face over and over. She suddenly remembered the sensation of being blasted by the Fifth Angel's beam. They both remembered losing an arm to Zeruel. They knew very well what the Angels were capable of, and now their friend -former friend?- was threatening them with what could very well be the same kind of power.
绫波举起手，掌心对着他们。他猛然忆起第三使徒将能量矛不断刺入他面庞的恐怖感受。她亦突然回想起被第五使徒光束击中的触感。两人都记得被 Zeruel 夺走手臂的往事。他们深知使徒的能耐，如今，他们的朋友——抑或昔日之友——正以可能相同的力量对他们构成威胁。

"You will answer me now," Rei demanded. "I will not-"
你现在就得回答我，" Rei 坚持道。"我不会-

"Calm down!" she said. "We're pilots, like you!"
冷静点！"她说，"我们和你一样，都是飞行员！

Rei's hand dipped slightly. "...You two are Eva pilots as well?" She blinked, staring at her for several tense seconds. "Then you must be the Second Child, Pilot Soryu."
绫波的手微微一沉。“……你们俩也是 EVA 的驾驶员吗？”她眨了眨眼，紧盯着对方好几秒。“那你肯定是第二适格者，驾驶员惣流了。”

He took a careful step towards her. "Yeah. Don't you remember us? We're your friends."
他小心翼翼地朝她迈了一步。“对啊。你难道不记得我们了吗？我们是你的朋友。”

Rei frowned. "I know of you, Pilot Soryu, but not you." She turned to glare at him. "What are you?"
丽皱起眉头。“我听说过你，飞行员索玉，但不是你。”她转过身，目光锐利地盯着他。“你究竟是什么人？”

She sighed and put a hand to her head. "Memory loss, on top of everything else. Just freaking great..."
她叹了口气，手扶额头。“居然还失忆，真是雪上加霜……”

"Memory loss?" Rei echoed. "But that would mean-"
记忆丧失？" 雷重复道。"但那岂不是意味着-

Her head abruptly twitched sideways and she stumbled as if struck from behind, almost colliding with him. Rei quickly stood back up and stared at them, looking somewhat confused and almost accusatory, then swiftly clapped both hands on her head as she bent over and groaned in pain.
她的头猛地一偏，身体摇晃，仿佛背后遭了一击，差点撞上他。Rei 立刻站稳，目光紧盯着对方，神情既困惑又似有责备，紧接着双手抱头弯下腰，发出痛苦的呻吟。

"Rei?!" they exclaimed together as their friend dropped to her knees. She quickly picked Rei up; he tried to help but his legs gave out almost immediately. All he could do was struggle his way to a chair while she gently laid Rei on the bed. Rei seemed to be completely unaware of them, curling up into a ball still clutching her head.
"Rei?!" 他们同时惊呼，目睹朋友跪倒在地。她急忙扶起 Rei，他本想帮忙，双腿却几乎立刻瘫软。他只能艰难地挪到椅子旁，而她则轻柔地将 Rei 放在床上。Rei 仿佛全然不觉周围有人，蜷缩着身体，依旧紧抱头部。

It took five long and nerve-wracking minutes before Rei slowly began to uncurl herself. She stared up at the ceiling, one hand on her forehead.
经过漫长而令人紧张的五分钟，Rei 才慢慢开始舒展身体。她仰头望着天花板，一只手轻抚额头。

"I see..." she said. "I am now the third. It appears that my plan worked."
我明白了……"她若有所思地说。"我现在位列第三，看来我的计划奏效了。

"Rei?" they said at the same time. "Are you alright now?"
Rei？" 两人异口同声地问，"你现在没事了吧？

Rei gave the question some thought. "It could be argued that I am now better than when you came into the room. Your presence assisted in triggering my dormant memories." Her eyes shifted between the two of them, and she frowned. "How much of... me... do you know about now?"
丽对这个问题深思熟虑。“或许可以这样认为，你进房间后，我变得比之前更出色了。你的到来触发了我的记忆。”她目光在两人间游移，眉头微蹙。“关于我，你现在究竟了解多少？”

"Doctor Akagi told Misato and I everything," she replied. "Misato didn't believe the cover story, and I just sort of... sneaked after them. Afterwards, I told Shinji what I knew."
安吉医生把一切都告诉了我和三笠，"她回答说。"三笠不相信官方的解释，我便悄悄地尾随其后。后来，我把了解到的情况告诉了真嗣。

Rei turned her head to look properly at him. "So you know who I was made in the image of..."
瑞转过头，认真地注视着他。"看来你知道我是以谁为原型创造的……"

He nodded, but his eyes darted to one side, unable to maintain eye contact. "Yes. You were created from my mother's DNA. I... don't know what that means for our relationship."
他点头示意，目光却不由自主地移开，难以直视对方。“没错，你是用我母亲的 DNA 创造的。我……真不清楚这会对我们的关系产生什么影响。”

"...Are we no longer friends?" Rei almost sounded... upset.
"...我们不再是朋友了吗？" Rei 的声音里几乎带着一丝难过。

"No!" he instantly exclaimed. "I just... are you my mother? A sister? Cousin? What does this mean?"
不！"他立刻惊呼。"我只是...您是我的母亲吗？还是姐姐？表亲？这究竟是什么意思？

She slapped her forehead. He belatedly realised that their synchronisation was beginning to wear off. "Does it really matter that much?" Asuka groaned. "We were friends before, why would we not be friends now?"
她拍了拍自己的额头。他这才恍然大悟，他们的同步正开始逐渐失效。“这真的有那么重要吗？”明日香嘟囔着。“我们以前是朋友，为什么现在就不能继续做朋友呢？”

"Because of... what I am," said Rei. "What I have been created for."
因为...我是谁，"雷说。"我被赋予的使命。

From opposite sides of the bed, Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other. Rei had been created to be an Evangelion pilot, hadn't she? Why would they be upset about that?
床的两端，真嗣与明日香目光交汇。绫波本就是为成为 EVA 驾驶员而生的，不是吗？他们为何因此感到困扰呢？

"It doesn't matter why you were created," said Asuka. "You're our friend, and we don't know anything that would change that."
你为何被创造并不重要，"明日香说道，"你是我们的朋友，我们并不知晓任何能改变这一事实的事情。

A weight seemed to lift from Rei's shoulders. She sighed with relief. "Thank you," she murmured.
绫感到肩上的重担仿佛消失了，她松了口气，轻声道：“谢谢。”

"It's fine, Rei," said Shinji. "But... surely there was a better way than sacrificing yourself like that. A way that didn't end with us thinking we'd lost you!"
没事的，丽，" 碇真嗣说道，"但是……肯定有比这样牺牲自己更好的办法。一个不会让我们误以为失去你的办法！

Asuka didn't speak, but she did direct a disapproving glare at Rei.
明日香虽未言语，却向绫波投去了不悦的眼神。

Rei looked down at her body. "No, there was not. My body was falling apart and I did not have long to live. Nothing could have prevented it. Doctor Akagi would have had to transfer my consciousness to a new body one way or the other."
绫低头审视自己的身体，说道：“不，确实没有其他办法。我的身体正在瓦解，生命已所剩无几。任何努力都无济于事。赤木医生无论如何都得把我的意识转移到新的躯体上。”

"So you went out in a blaze of glory, because Doctor Akagi could just claim you 'miraculously survived'," said Asuka, bringing her hands up to make air quotes.
"所以你是以一种辉煌的方式离开的，因为阿卡吉医生可以宣称你'奇迹般地生还了'"，飞鸟说着，双手举起做出引号的动作。

"I apologise for the pain I caused the two of you, but it would have been impossible to quickly explain, and dangerous for you to know. That is why I spoke as if I were truly about to die."
我为给你们二人造成的痛苦深表歉意，但当时无法迅速解释清楚，而且让你们知晓真相也存在风险。因此，我才表现得仿佛真的命不久矣。

Asuka ran a hand down her face. "Goddamnit. I'm not happy about that, but at the same time I'm glad you're safe. I just wish the same could be said for Glasses."
明日香用手抹了抹脸。“真是的。我心里不痛快，但看到你没事又感到欣慰。只可惜眼镜没这么幸运。”

Rei began to nod her agreement, but then she suddenly stiffened. Both Asuka and Shinji immediately noticed. "Rei? What's the matter?"
绫本要点头表示同意，却突然僵住了。明日香和真嗣立刻察觉到了异样。“绫，怎么回事？”

"...You should go and visit Pilot Aida," said Rei.
"...你应该去见见飞行员艾达," 雷说道。

"Kensuke? But-" Kensuke？可是-

Rei cut Shinji off with a wave of a hand. "I do not wish to be rude, but right now I need to rest and get my memories properly seated. Normally I would have remained in isolation for a couple of days, to prevent what you saw from happening."
绫波挥手打断了真嗣的话。"我无意冒犯，只是此刻我必须休息，让记忆归位。按常规，我会独自静养数日，以免你目睹的状况再次出现。"

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other across the bed. It had been a while since they'd last checked in on their other fellow pilot. Asuka soon shrugged and stood up to head towards the door. Shinji also stood up... and would have fallen over had Asuka not quickly grabbed hold of him.
真嗣与明日香隔床相望。他们已许久未去探望另一位同僚飞行员。明日香随即耸肩起身，向门口走去。真嗣亦起身，若非明日香及时扶住，他险些跌倒。

"This... might take a little while," he weakly remarked.
"这事...恐怕得花点时间，"他无力地评论道。

That didn't matter. If he still couldn't walk yet then she would help him until he could. Something for which he was deeply appreciative.
这无关紧要。倘若他依旧无法行走，她会一直扶持他，直至他能独立行走。他对此感激至深。

...He absolutely did not sense the blush on her face. Or else.
...他丝毫未察觉她脸上的红晕。不然的话。

With some effort they began to make their way through NERV. It was slow going at first, but gradually his steps became just a little more steady. He still couldn't keep his balance on his own, but they were in no great rush. Numerous medical staff passed them by, but nobody seemed inclined to hinder them, merely stepping aside as he limped past guided by her steady hand.
经过一番努力，他们开始在 NERV 内部缓慢前行。起初步伐不稳，但随着时间推移，他的脚步逐渐变得坚定。虽然他还不能独立行走，但他们并不急于求成。许多医护人员从旁经过，却无人阻拦，只是在他一瘸一拐地被她稳稳搀扶着经过时，纷纷让路。

"I regret everything. I regret everything I've ever done."
我深感悔恨，对过往的一切行为都感到后悔。

If anybody had been in the room with Misato, they would not have been in the least bit surprised at her first words upon regaining consciousness. As it was, the room was empty; no big-brained friend to tell her what was happening, no pair of teenagers being awkward around each other, not knowing what they could have if they just took one little step.
如果当时房间里有其他人陪伴着 Misato，他们对她醒来后说的第一句话肯定不会感到意外。可惜，房间空荡荡的；没有机智的朋友来解释情况，也没有一对青少年在彼此间尴尬地徘徊，不知道只要勇敢迈出一小步，他们就能拥有的可能。

And no stupid, stupid, stupidunshaven man to hold her and tell her that everything was going to be alright.
也没有那个愚不可及、满脸胡茬的男人来拥抱她，安慰她说一切都会好起来的。

All she had for company was yet another splitting headache. Thankfully it was not a hangover headache, indicating that she had fallen off the wagon and done something stupid while drunk. Misato began to dig around in her memory, trying to work out how she had come to be in this room and... strapped to the bed.
她身边只有那剧烈的头痛作伴。所幸这并非宿醉带来的痛楚，意味着她并未因酒醉而重蹈覆辙，做出蠢事。Misato 努力在记忆中探寻，想要弄明白自己是怎么来到这个房间，并且...被绑在了床上。

...Oh. 哦...

She had done something stupid. While not drunk. In a fit of stress and anger she had essentially broken every single gun safety law and destroyed a critical piece of equipment. Yeah, she probably wasn't going anywhere for a while. Especially considering the fact that she killed all of those-
她干了件傻事。当时并未醉酒。在巨大的压力和愤怒驱使下，她几乎触犯了所有枪支安全法规，还毁掉了一件至关重要的设备。看来，她短期内恐怕无法离开。更别提她还杀害了那些人-

Misato tried to put a hand over her mouth only for the straps to get in the way. The best she could do was keep her mouth tightly closed as vomit tried to escape. A bit still managed to dribble out, but she swallowed the rest down with a great force of effort. And with her hands cuffed, she couldn't reach the glass of water sitting next to her bed. She would have to deal with the hideous taste in her mouth until somebody bothered to show up.
弥生本想用手捂嘴，无奈带子挡道。她只能紧闭双唇，竭力抑制呕吐感。虽有少许溢出，但她还是强忍着将余下的咽了回去。双手被铐，无法拿到床边的水杯。只能忍受口中的恶臭，等待有人来解围。

The door completely failed to open, and somebody completely failed to walk in, despite Misato's hopes. She sighed, and tried to get some saliva into her mouth to swish it clean while she waited for something to happen.
门始终紧闭，无人进入，与 Misato 的期望相悖。她轻叹一声，努力分泌唾液以清洁口腔，静待事态发展。

Toji sighed as he flopped down on the floor in front of the television. The apartment building his family had managed to rent on such short notice was not exactly in top condition. The damn elevator was currently being repaired, and the new Suzuhara home was on the tenth floor. The Horaki family hadn't fared much better, being on the ninth floor, and Toji had of course helped them move in despite already being tired from shifting the Suzuhara family's belongings.
东治叹了口气，瘫坐在电视机前的地板上。他们家在匆忙中租下的这栋公寓楼，条件并不尽如人意。那台电梯正在维修，而他们的新居——铃原家——位于十楼。洞木家的情况也好不到哪去，住在九楼，尽管东治已经因搬运铃原家的物品而感到疲惫，他还是尽力帮助洞木家搬了家。

Some of which they'd had to leave behind, such as Toji's sports gear and Nozomi's toys and games. A car could only carry so much, after all, and it wasn't like they could risk going back for more.
有些东西不得不舍弃，比如东二的体育装备和望美的玩具游戏。毕竟一辆车装载有限，他们也无法冒险回头再去取更多。

Some of the people from Tokyo-3 weren't so lucky. The government hadn't been prepared for a sudden influx of what amounted to refugees in their own country and were scrambling to find places for them to live. Tokyo-2 residents were complaining, despite being close enough to Tokyo-3 to know that the city had suffered substantial damage in recent months.
东京-3 的部分居民命运多舛。政府对突如其来的国内难民潮措手不及，正焦头烂额地为他们安置住所。而东京-2 的居民，尽管与东京-3 相邻，清楚其近期遭受的重创，却依旧怨声载道。

Hikari's father had initially been hesitant about taking Misato's pet penguin with them, but between Nozomi, Kodama once she saw Pen-pen, and of course Hisae, it had been impossible to say no. They hadn't been able to fit Pen-pen's special refrigerator into their moving plans, but the little guy didn't seem all that concerned yet.
光之父起初对是否带上美里的小企鹅宠物颇感踌躇，但在望、见到企鹅彭彭后的儿玉，以及久江的合力劝说下，他终究无法拒绝。尽管彭彭的专用冰箱未能纳入搬家计划，但这小家伙似乎并未因此感到困扰。

There was a knock at the door. Before Toji could haul himself back to his feet, Hisae was already rushing to the door. "Hey! No running!" he called out to her.
门口响起敲门声。东二还没来得及起身，久江已急忙跑向门口。“喂！别跑！”他冲她喊道。

While NERV's doctors had said that she was able to move around under her own power now, they had insisted that she not do any strenuous activity until she had completed the last of her physical therapy at Tokyo-2's hospital. Despite her insistence that she felt as good as new, Toji and their father had been asked to make sure she didn't push herself too hard.
NERV 的医生虽然宣布她已能自主活动，但仍坚持她在完成东京-2 医院最后阶段的物理治疗前，避免任何剧烈运动。尽管她坚称自己已恢复如初，东治和他们的父亲还是被叮嘱要确保她不过度操劳。

Hisae groaned loudly, pointedly glaring at Toji over her shoulder as she exaggeratedly took slower steps. She could complain all she liked, but if he had anything to say about it she wouldn't even so much as walk quickly until a doctor said so. The last thing he wanted was for her to have an accident and get put back in a hospital bed. Especially since it wouldn't be a NERV hospital.
久世大声呻吟，故意回头瞪了东治一眼，夸张地放慢脚步。她尽管可以抱怨，但只要他还有发言权，她就得等到医生允许才能加快步伐。他最不愿见到的，就是她因意外再次躺进医院，尤其是非 NERV 的医院。

"Hi Hisae. Hello Toji," said Hikari as Hisae let her in.
"嗨，久世。你好，冬儿，"光在久世开门让她进来时说道。

"Uh, hey Class Rep," Toji said, flushing slightly at the shy look she gave him.
"呃，班长，" 东二有些脸红地说，她那羞涩的眼神让他有些不好意思。

"You probably shouldn't be calling me that anymore," said Hikari. "We're not even at school at the moment, and I most likely won't be a class representative when we get into school here."
你或许不该再那样叫我，"光说道，"毕竟现在我们都不在学校，而且我在这里上学后大概也不会担任班级代表了。

"Er, sorry. Force o' habit, ya know?"
哎呀，不好意思，习惯了，你懂的。

"What's wrong with using my name, anyway? Especially now that..."
用我的名字怎么了？特别是现在...

Their blushes deepened as the conversation slammed to a halt. Hisae stared at the two of them for a second and then giggled, which really didn't help matters.
对话突然中断，他们的脸颊愈发通红。Hisae 看了他们一眼，忍不住笑出声来，这反而让气氛更加尴尬。

"So!" Toji exclaimed to drown out his sister. "Why, uh... what's up? Need me to move more stuff?"
所以！" 透治提高声音，试图压过妹妹的话。"怎么了，呃... 还需要我帮忙搬东西吗？

"No no," said Hikari, waving her hands. "You've done more than enough. I was just popping in to see what your family's plans for dinner were, because I wanted to make something for all of us-"
不不，"光边摆手边说，"你已经帮了大忙了。我进来是想了解一下你们家晚餐的安排，因为我打算给大家准备点吃的——

"Yes!" interrupted Hisae, and began bouncing excitedly. "We're doing that tonight, Big Bro!"
对啊！" Hisae 兴奋地打断道，并开始激动地跳起来。"我们今晚就要行动，大哥！

Their father chose that moment to come out of the bathroom. "What are we doing tonight?" he asked.
就在那时，他们的父亲从浴室走了出来，问道：“今晚我们有什么安排？”

"Hikari's gonna do dinner for us, dad!" said Hisae.
"光要为我们准备晚餐了，爸爸！" 久惠说道。

The two Suzuhara men glanced at each other. Both of them were still exhausted from having to go up and down ten flights of stairs multiple times. Hisae had helped as well, carrying smaller stuff, but she had needed to be told numerous times not to take two steps at a time and not to try and race up and down the stairs.
铃原家的两位男士相视一眼，都因频繁上下十层楼梯而显得疲惫。Hisae 虽也帮忙搬了些小东西，却屡次被叮嘱不要一次跨两级，也别在楼梯上跑来跑去。

Someone else handling dinner sounded like a miracle.
有人代劳晚餐，简直是天赐之福。

"No arguments here," said Dad. "Will you be fine cooking for both families on your own, though?"
这里没有异议，"爸爸问道，"但你一个人准备两家人的饭菜，没问题吧？

"Trust me, Dad, she'll be fine," said Toji. "Hell, she could have probably fit Ken in too if... well..."
相信我，爸爸，她不会有事的，" 托吉说。"其实，她说不定还能带上肯，如果... 那个...

Even Hisae's energy was dampened at the mention of Kensuke. He should have been here with them, if he was too injured to pilot anymore. But NERV refused to say what was actually wrong with him.
提及健介时，连久枝的活力也显得黯淡。若他因伤势过重无法继续驾驶，理应与大家同在。然而，NERV 却对健介的具体状况讳莫如深。

"...Akera actually came up to me before we left and asked where he was," said Hikari, thoughtfully. "You know, the girl who wanted him to take photos of her."
...其实，在我们出发前，阿克拉特意来找我，询问他的去向，"光沉思着说。"就是那个希望他帮她拍照的女孩。

"Akera?" Toji quirked an eyebrow. "Why would she be asking about him? Their deal was done, wasn't it?"
阿克拉？" 托吉眉头一挑。"她怎么突然问起他来了？他们之间的交易不是已经完成了吗？

"Maybe she wasn't done with him, in a way," said Hikari.
光说：“或许她和他之间，某种意义上还未了结。”

"Ya mean she might have... had a thing for Ken?" Toji stared off into space, struggling to fit that idea into his worldview.
"你是说，她可能对 Ken...有意思？" 东治凝视着远方，费力地将这个念头纳入自己的认知里。

Dad snorted. "This may come as a shock to you, son, but girls actually have varying tastes in prospective partners."
爸爸哼了一声。“儿子，你可能觉得意外，但女孩们对未来伴侣的喜好其实各有千秋。”

His words brought a little laughter to the room, but the mood soon turned sombre again.
他的话语让房间里响起了一阵轻笑，然而不久气氛又重新变得凝重。

"Damn, I hope Ken'll be alright," Toji sadly remarked. "Couldn't get anything out of Shin-man or Soryu, and now when I try calling them their numbers seem to be blocked by NERV."
该死，真希望健能平安无事，"东治难过地说。"信哥和苏龙那边一点消息也没有，现在我再打过去，发现他们的号码都被 NERV 给屏蔽了。

"He'll be fine!" Hisae insisted with all the determination she could muster. "NERV looked after me and got my legs working again, they can fix whatever's wrong with Kensuke too!"
他不会有事的！" Hisae 坚定地强调，竭尽全力展现决心。"NERV 曾帮助我恢复行走，他们同样能解决 Kensuke 的任何问题！

Toji looked at her, unsure of what to say. While she was right that NERV had stepped in to quite literally get her back on her feet, what Hisae didn't know was that Kensuke had needed to twist their arm to get them to do it. Of course, she was 'only' a civilian while Kensuke was a pilot, but Toji couldn't quite bring himself to trust them.
当户凝视着她，一时语塞。尽管她言之有理，NERV 确实出手相助，让她重获新生，但久世并不知晓，健介为了促成此事，曾费尽心机。毕竟，她仅是普通市民，而健介则是驾驶员，然而当户始终难以对他们全然信赖。

Then again, what choice did he have?
再说了，他还有别的选择吗？

Technician Nagisa glanced up from his book at the readouts on the screen in front of him. All of the numbers and bars were exactly where they should be, and nothing was happening in the quarantine chamber, so he returned his attention to the book.
技术员渚从书本上抬起头，扫了一眼面前的屏幕上的数据。所有数字和图表都显示正常，隔离室内亦无异常，他便继续埋头阅读。

The Lilim were such fascinating creatures. Not content with the reality they lived in, many of them created their own universes inside their head and then put that universe on paper for others to read, or turned it into an audio-visual experience. Other Lilim would lap it up, and then some would even be inspired to make their own offshoots of those universes.
莉莉姆这种生物极具魅力。他们不甘于现状，许多莉莉姆在心中构建了自己的宇宙，随后将这些宇宙书写成文供人阅读，或制作成视听作品。其他莉莉姆对此如饥似渴，更有甚者，会因此灵感迸发，创造出这些宇宙的衍生作品。

And what imaginations some creators had! The author whose book Kaworu was currently reading had created a series spanning almost a dozen novels about a world that sat on the back of a turtle in space. That had taken quite a while to wrap his head around. The author seemed more interested in the lives of the people on that world than explaining the existence of such a thing. Right now he was halfway through the story of a police officer who had been thrown back in time. Something about that concept poked at a part of Kaworu's mind, but for the life of him he couldn't work out why. There were so many other universes to explore, but he was just one person, and there was just not enough time.
某些创作者的想象力真是令人惊叹！卡瓦鲁正在读的这本书的作者，构思了一个由近十部小说组成的系列，描绘了一个位于太空巨龟背上的世界。他花了好一阵子才理解这个设定。作者似乎更热衷于描绘那个世界中人们的生活，而非解释这种奇特存在的缘由。现在，他正读到故事的中途，讲述了一位警察意外穿越回过去。这个情节触动了卡瓦鲁内心深处的某种感觉，但他就是捉摸不透其中的原因。宇宙间还有无数世界等待探索，可惜他只是一个人，时间总是显得那么有限。

And speaking of time... 提到时间...

Something else poked at his mind, this one much more immediate. Kaworu sighed and put the book down. He had been hoping to finish the story, to find out what happened, but fate had other plans.
另一件事触动了他的心弦，这次更为紧迫。薰叹了口气，把书搁下。他原本渴望读完这个故事，探知结局，然而命运却另有打算。

He didn't know exactly what SEELE had done to be able to slip him into this fortress. Although judging by what he knew of them, it had likely involved at least one death so he could take the luckless Lilim's place. Thankfully nobody at NERV seemed to care about his appearance, which he had initially believed would be a red flag.
他不清楚 SEELE 究竟用了什么手段，才得以将他秘密送入这座堡垒。从他对 SEELE 的了解来看，这背后至少牵涉到一人的牺牲，以便他能够顶替那个倒霉的莉莉姆。好在 NERV 的人并未对他的外貌表示关注，他原本担心这会成为暴露的破绽。

That could well be because of a certain other, like him but not, that had free reign of the place. Kaworu had not had the chance to meet her, despite his best efforts. The closest he had gotten had been when she had waited outside the quarantine room while her red-haired compatriot had come in to check on the unfortunate Pilot Aida.
这很可能是因为某个与他相似却又不同的人，在这里拥有自由行动的权力。尽管卡瓦鲁尽了最大努力，他仍未有机会遇见她。他最接近的一次是当她在外面等待隔离室时，她的红发同伴进来查看不幸的飞行员相田的情况。

He... may have focused the camera on her a bit longer than necessary.
他... 或许让镜头在她身上停留得稍久了些。

If Kaworu could have had his way, he would just leave NERV and vanish. There was so much of this world he wanted to experience, not just the books and other media. But SEELE had a hold on him, and he could not ignore his progenitor's will forever either.
倘若薰能随心所欲，他定会脱离 NERV，悄然隐匿。这世间有太多他渴望亲身体验的事物，而非仅限于书本与媒体。然而，SEELE 的掌控令他无法摆脱，他亦不能永远违背其创造者的意愿。

Returning his attention to the current situation, Kaworu's hands flashed over the keyboard for a minute, and when he was done... the numbers and bars looked exactly the same.
薰将注意力重新聚焦于当前局势，手指在键盘上飞速敲击了一分钟，但当他操作完毕后……屏幕上的数字和图表依旧毫无变化。

Exactly as they should be, for just long enough.
正如预期，它们持续了恰到好处的时间。

He opened his eyes. He was still in the metal coffin, still unsure of where exactly he was. There was nothing to hear, or even see through the tiny window in front of his eyes, blurry as his vision was. What little he could feel of his body was in pain, his limbs almost completely unresponsive. He couldn't even be sure of his last memory.
他睁开双眼，发现自己依旧躺在冰冷的金属棺材中，对身处何方一无所知。四周静寂无声，透过眼前模糊的小窗，视线所及之处一片朦胧。身体的疼痛感让他难以忍受，四肢几乎失去了知觉。至于最后的记忆，他更是无从确认。

After either a minute or an eternity, a muffled sound finally reached his ears. He stared through the window, but it seemed like another eternity passed before something appeared on the other side.
在一分钟或仿佛永恒的等待后，一个低沉的声音终于传入他的耳中。他透过窗户凝视，仿佛又过了许久，对面才隐约显现出什么。

"You're awake. How about that," remarked the white-haired man. He leaned away and did something, and there was a hiss of escaping air as the coffin opened up.
"你醒了啊。真是巧了，"白发男子说道。他身体后仰，做了个动作，紧接着棺材开启，发出空气泄漏的嘶嘶声。

He tried to sit up, but only managed to raise his head slightly. His vision went sideways just as a hand came down on his chest, pushing him back down.
他试图起身，却只能微微抬起头。突然，一只手压在他的胸前，将他按回原位，他的视线也因此变得歪斜。

"Take it easy, you've been unconscious for quite a while," said the man, then began to busy himself out of sight. "Just relax, wait until you've fully woken up."
别急，你昏迷了好一阵子，"那人说道，随即忙碌起来，不见了踪影。"先歇着，等彻底清醒了再说。

As sensation began to creep back into his limbs, he realised that the man was loosening thick straps around his body. When the last of them fell away, the man put an arm behind him and a hand on his shoulder and gently pulled him up to a sitting position.
随着知觉逐渐恢复，他察觉到那人正在解开束缚他身体的厚实带子。最后一根带子松开后，那人一手扶住他的背，一手搭在他的肩上，轻柔地帮他坐起身来。

"Can you at least remember your name right now?" the man asked, a hint of a smirk in his voice.
"你现在至少能记得自己的名字吧？"男人问道，语气中带着一丝戏谑。

He looked down at his torso, slowly shifting his arms and legs as his body realised it was time to wake up and get moving. After a minute, he blinked slowly and turned his head towards the man.
他低头审视自己的身体，缓缓挪动手脚，身体逐渐意识到该苏醒并动起来了。片刻后，他缓缓眨眼，转头望向那位男子。

"You know exactly who I am, Tabris."
塔布里斯，你清楚地知道我是谁。

"Of course I do," said Tabris, giving him a smug look that quickly faded. "Anyway, how are you feeling?"
我当然会，"塔布里斯带着一丝得意地说，但随即神情恢复如常。"对了，你现在感觉如何？

"...Strange," Bardiel admitted, looking down again at the body he was inhabiting. "I can't see very well. Human bodies are so... different. And unfortunately-" He cut himself off with a scowl.
"...真是奇怪，" 巴迪尔承认，再次低头审视他所占据的身体。"我的视线模糊不清。人类的身体与我所熟悉的截然不同。而且不幸的是——" 他皱眉中断了话语。

The plan had seemed perfect. Lay low inside the mockery of Father, hold back from attacking at the first opportunity, and instead wait for Zeruel to attack so that he could strike in the confusion. The false flesh had offered no resistance to Bardiel, primed as it was for one of His children to join with Him. The Lilim inside, on the other hand, had managed to get a warning out before he could be silenced, because Bardiel hadn't been able to immediately assimilate him too.
计划原本看似无懈可击。在父亲的嘲讽中隐匿，抑制住初次机会就出击的冲动，转而等待 Zeruel 先行出手，以便趁乱反击。那具虚假的肉体对 Bardiel 毫无抗拒，因为它已为祂的一个孩子与之融合做好了准备。而内部的莉莉姆则设法在能被沉默之前发出了警告，因为 Bardiel 未能立即将其同化。

"Unfortunately, you can't do anything now," Tabris finished for him. "You've merged into that body, and thus can no longer join with Father."
遗憾的是，你此刻无能为力，"塔布里斯替他补充道。"你已与那具身体融为一体，无法再与父亲融合。

"That was not exactly my intention. The plan, after my attack failed, was to quickly consume it, recover my energy, and escape. But somehow, it managed to resist me.
我原本并非完全如此打算。原计划是，一旦我的攻击未能成功，便迅速将其吞噬，恢复体力，然后逃离。然而，它不知怎地竟抵挡住了我。

"The human body has a surprisingly resilient immune system," said Tabris. "At one point it seemed like it might actually consume you. To be honest, I'm shocked you didn't turn into a puddle of slurry."
塔布里斯说：'人体的免疫系统出奇地坚韧，曾有一度它似乎真能将你吞噬。说实话，你没变成一滩浆糊，我感到很惊讶。'

Bardiel nodded grimly. "Yes. But now I am trapped, and I can feel that this body... the battle for supremacy has severely depleted it. I don't have much time left; it- I am losing energy fast. Like a cup of water with a hole in the bottom." He looked up at Tabris and sighed. "Take me to Father. I may not be able to join with him like this, but... I want to see him before I die."
巴迪尔神色凝重地点了点头。“没错。可如今我身陷囹圄，我能感觉到这具躯体……为了争夺主导权，它已元气大伤。我时日无多，能量正迅速流失，犹如底部破洞的水杯。”他抬头望向塔布里斯，长叹一声。“带我去见父亲。我或许无法这样与他合为一体，但……我想在离世前见他一面。”

Tabris stared sadly at him for a moment, before echoing the sigh. "Of course. Do you think you can manage walking?"
塔布里斯悲伤地凝视了他片刻，随后也跟着叹息。“当然。你觉得自己能走动吗？”

Bardiel snorted. "I will greet Father on my own two feet, not being carried like a mewling infant."
巴迪尔哼了一声。“我要自己走去见父亲，才不要像个小婴儿似的被抱着。”

"Very well. Let us proceed then, before the Lilim discover us."
很好。那我们赶紧行动吧，免得被莉莉姆发现。

They were nearly there. He was doing well. It was even starting to seem like he was recovering somewhat. She didn't mind, since it wasn't like she had anywhere to be right now.
他们快到了。他表现不错，甚至开始显露出一些恢复的迹象。她对此并不介意，毕竟她现在也没有什么急事。

He was still thankful for her help. He did feel like he was getting some movement back. Perhaps by the time they got back to his room he wouldn't need her help.
他依旧对她给予的帮助心存感激。他确实感觉到自己的行动能力正在逐渐恢复。或许等他们回到他的房间，他就能独立行动，不再依赖她的帮助了。

Again, it wasn't like she minded or anything...
再说，她其实并不介意...

Slow as they were, it felt like it took hours for them to get from the hospital to the sector that contained the quarantine chamber. Of course, it had to be out of the way simply due to the purpose of the room, but that didn't make things any less irritating.
虽然他们动作迟缓，但感觉从医院到那个设有隔离室的区域仿佛耗费了数小时。显然，房间之所以偏僻，是因为其隔离功能，但这丝毫未减轻人们的烦躁情绪。

The airlock to the quarantine chamber was thankfully just ahead. One way or another, this was most likely going to be the last time they came down here anyway.
幸好，通往隔离室的气闸就在眼前。无论如何，这多半是他们最后一次踏足此地了。

That was a sobering thought, considering NERV hadn't been able to do anything for Kensuke.
考虑到 NERV 对健介束手无策，这个念头着实让人警醒。

They shouldn't give up hope yet, since there was still-
他们此刻还不应放弃希望，毕竟还有一线生机

The door opened. Technician Nagisa stepped out into the hallway, looking the opposite direction to them. He turned the other way, and jolted slightly upon seeing them standing there. Nagisa blinked a few times and opened his mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by someone else leaving the chamber.
门缓缓开启，技术员渚步出房间，目光投向与他们相反的走廊一侧。他转过身来，乍见他们伫立眼前，不禁微微一怔。渚眨了眨眼，正欲开口，却被另一人从室内走出打断了话语。

"...Kensuke?" they called out together.
“...Kensuke？” 他们异口同声地呼唤着。

The young man peered at them. Not only was he not wearing glasses, but it was also impossible to miss the fact that his eyes were now the same bright red as Technician Nagisa.
年轻人凝视着他们，不仅没戴眼镜，更明显的是，他的眼睛已变得和技师长濑一样鲜红。

"Whoever they are," he said, turning to Nagisa, "it looks like your plan is already starting to fail. Not even a minute has passed and we're already discovered."
不管是谁，" 他转向渚说，"看来你的计划一开始就遇到了挫折。连一分钟都不到，我们就已经暴露了。

"Whoever-" he began, puzzled.
"不管是谁-" 他开口道，一脸困惑。

"-we are?" she finished, angrily.
"我们是谁？" 她愤怒地结束了这句话。

Judging by how familiar he was being with Nagisa, that was not their friend standing there. Nagisa grinned at them, as if he knew exactly what they were thinking, while Kensuke -or rather the Angel wearing his skin- stared at them.
看他对渚那般熟稔的态度，显然站在那里的并非他们的朋友。渚朝他们咧嘴一笑，仿佛洞悉了他们的心思，而一旁的健介——或者说，披着他外皮的天使——正目不转睛地盯着他们。

"...Israfel?" he muttered.
"...伊斯拉菲尔吗？" 他低声自语。

"This has not altered the plan in the slightest," Nagisa interrupted, turning away from the pilots and proceeding down the corridor. "We have plenty of time to get down there."
这丝毫未改变计划，"渚打断他们，转身沿着走廊继续前行，"我们完全有时间下去。

The Angel stared at them a moment longer, then scoffed and began to follow him. "If you say so, Tabris."
天使又凝视了他们片刻，随后轻蔑一笑，跟上了他的步伐。“既然你这么说，塔布里斯。”

Stunned, it took her a few seconds before her legs would move. She charged forward, intent on putting the Angel who had stolen her fellow pilot's body down for good this time. He crashed to the ground almost instantly as Asuka let him go, her sudden movement not helping Shinji's still-recovering legs. The sound of him hitting the floor brought Asuka up short, and her eyes darted between Shinji and the escaping Angels.
震惊之余，她愣了几秒才回过神来，随即冲上前去，誓要将那个夺走同伴身体的使徒彻底击败。阿苏卡一松手，那使徒便应声倒地，而她突如其来的动作对真嗣仍在恢复中的双腿并无益处。撞击声让阿苏卡猛地停步，她的目光在真嗣和逃窜的使徒之间迅速切换。

Considering the circumstances, it was clear where her priorities laid.
考虑到具体情况，她的优先事项一目了然。

Asuka rushed back to Shinji, grabbing him by the arm and hauling him back to his feet. Before he could thank her she yanked his arm around her shoulder, grabbed him by the waist, and began dragging him back to the elevator. Thankfully, it was still waiting on their floor.
明日香匆忙赶回真嗣身旁，一把抓住他的胳膊，用力将他扶起。真嗣还未来得及道谢，她已将他的手臂搭在自己肩头，紧握他的腰侧，开始拖着他向电梯走去。所幸，电梯依旧停在他们所在的楼层。

In the elevator, Asuka worked her phone out of her pocket with her free hand and opened it up. Her list of phone contacts was small, which made it easy to find the one she needed.
电梯中，明日香用闲着的手从口袋里取出手机，随即解锁屏幕。她的联系人不多，轻松便找到了要找的那位。

"Doctor, it's Pilot Soryu!" she said the moment the call connected. For Shinji's benefit, she activated the speaker setting. "The Angel took over Aida's body and left quarantine!"
医生，是飞行员 Soryu！" 她一接通电话便急切地说道，并为了 Shinji 能听见，开启了扬声器。"天使已经控制了 Aida 的身体，并逃离了隔离区！

"What?!" Doctor Akagi's shout filled the elevator car.There was some muffled movement and tapping of buttons. "The quarantine systems aren't showing anything out of the ordinary. Are you positive?"
什么?!" 阿卡吉医生的惊呼在电梯内回荡。接着是一些模糊的响动和按钮的敲击声。"隔离系统并未显示异常。你真的确定吗？

"Shinji and I both saw it! Aida walked out of the airlock with that white-haired technician, and both of them had red eyes! They mentioned they had plenty of time to 'get down there', whatever that means, and then walked off."
我和 Shinji 都目睹了这一幕！Aida 与那位白发技术员一同走出气闸，两人的眼睛都泛着红光！他们提到有充足的时间'下去'，虽然不清楚具体含义，随后便离开了。

"Get down... oh shit. Alright, I'm going to believe you because I can't think of a reason you'd lie about something like this. Get into your plugsuits and head to the cage as soon as possible. I'm prepping Unit-02 n-... Sir?"
快下来...哎呀，糟糕。行吧，我相信你，毕竟想不出你为何要在这事上撒谎。赶紧穿上插入栓服，尽快赶到机库。我正在准备二号机...长官？

Asuka heard what might have been Commander Ikari's voice, but couldn't make out what he was saying.
明日香似乎听到了碇司令的声音，然而具体内容却模糊不清。

"Both of them? ... But what about ... I see. Very well, I'll give the order."
两个人都要吗？...那关于...我明白了。好的，我会下达命令。

"Doctor?" said Shinji. "What's going on?"
医生？" 新二问道。"这是怎么了？

"Slight change of plans. We're sending Unit-02 and Unit-01 down."
计划有微调。我们将派出 Unit-02 和 Unit-01 执行任务。

"Both?!" Asuka glanced at Shinji, disbelief written on both their faces.
"两个都是？！" 明日香看向真嗣，两人脸上都露出了难以置信的表情。

"That's what the Commander ordered." There was more muffled talking. "Ah. Considering what your targets are, an AT-Field isn't going to be much of a factor. Still, you will need to cover Unit-01 if anything unexpected happens."
这就是指挥官的指令。" 随后又是一阵低语。"哦，鉴于你们的攻击对象，AT 力场影响不大。但万一有突发状况，你们得确保初号机的安全。

"Of course. Anything else?" Asuka glanced up at the display showing the elevator's ascent. It was going too goddamn slow.
"当然。还有其他事吗？"飞鸟抬头望向电梯上升的显示屏，心里暗骂这速度真是慢得让人心急。

There was a pause, and then Ritsuko continued with what sounded like trepidation in her voice. "Yes, there is one other thing... You two will be entering a very highly restricted area. Only three people are permitted down there, and none of them are you two, but we don't have a choice. Besides, you already know more than you should thanks to that little excursion we had. Do what it takes to neutralise the enemy and then immediately return. Is that clear?"
短暂的沉默后，律子继续说，声音中透露出些许紧张：“是的，还有一点……你们将进入一个高度保密的区域。那里只允许三个人进入，你们并不在其中，但我们没有其他选择。况且，由于之前的行动，你们已经知道得过多了。务必消灭敌人，然后迅速返回。清楚了吗？”

Asuka narrowed her eyes, and she could sense Shinji doing the same. They both knew what kind of skeletons NERV kept in their closet now. "...Crystal, Doctor."
明日香眯起双眼，察觉到真嗣也做出同样反应。两人都已明了 NERV 所隐藏的秘密。“...水晶，博士。”

After reaching the changing room and getting into their plugsuits -thankfully Shinji was able to handle that on his own- there was just the final run to the cages. Asuka breathed a sigh of relief once the door to the cages was in sight. In the first cage, containing Unit-01, she ran past the people rushing to finish preparations on the Evangelion, up the gantry steps, hopped into the entry plug and almost threw Shinji into his seat.
抵达更衣室并换上插入栓服后——庆幸的是，真嗣能独立完成这一步——仅剩最后一段冲刺至机库。当机库大门出现在视线中时，明日香如释重负。在存放初号机的第一个机库内，她穿梭于忙碌准备使徒的人群中，疾步登上楼梯，跃入插入栓，几乎将真嗣抛入他的座位。

"Right, let's do this," she said. A sudden hand gripping her wrist halted her as she was about to leave. She turned to see Shinji staring intensely at her.
"好的，开始吧，"她刚说完，一只手突然紧紧抓住了她的手腕，阻止了她离开的脚步。她回头一看，只见真嗣正目光灼灼地凝视着她。

He seemed like he was about to say something, but then gave up with a shake of his head before yanking Asuka back towards him. Before she could react, he gently placed a kiss on her forehead. She stared at him, blinking rapidly, before remembering that they had a job to do. She spent the entire run to Unit-02 fighting down the blush.
他好像要说什么，却摇摇头作罢，随即一把将明日香拉近。未等她反应，他已在她的额头轻吻一下。她望着他，眨眼间回神，这才记起任务在身。她一路奔向二号机，竭力压制着脸上的红晕。

A blush that he absolutely did not mimic.
他绝对没有模仿的那种羞涩。

There was no time for pre-start checks with Angels already in the base. The Evangelions quickly came to life, and he immediately felt a familiar and welcome presence in the back of his mind.
由于天使已迫近基地，启动前的检查时间被压缩。福音战士迅速启动，他随即感受到脑海中那股熟悉而令人安心的存在。

"What's happening, Shinji?" his mother asked.
"怎么了，真嗣？" 他的母亲关切地问。

He focused his thoughts on what had just happened while Unit-01 disengaged from the cage locks.
他全神贯注于刚才发生的一幕，与此同时，初号机正从笼锁中解脱出来。

"Oh dear..." 哎呀...

Unit-01 strode out of the cage and headed for the elevator, nodding at Unit-02 as she joined him. Doctor Akagi's voice came through the comms. "We only have one elevator that goes down to Terminal Dogma, and there's no time to send you down safely. Both of you get on now, and we'll just pray the elevator can handle the weight for the trip down."
单元-01 迈出笼子，径直走向电梯，当单元-02 加入时，它向她点头示意。赤木博士的声音通过通讯传来：“通往终端教条区的电梯只有一部，现在没时间确保安全了。你们俩赶紧上去，我们只能寄希望于电梯能承受住你们的重量，顺利抵达。”

They decided they didn't want to know what would happen if the elevator broke. Unit-02, getting there first, locked itself into the elevator and then grabbed Unit-01's arms. The elevator shot downwards, and they both felt the blush returning at the close proximity, despite being in separate Evangelions.
他们决定不去探究电梯故障的后果。Unit-02 抢先一步，将自己固定在电梯内，随即抓住了 Unit-01 的手臂。随着电梯的急速下坠，两人虽各自驾驶着福音战士，却仍因彼此的靠近而感到脸颊发热。

Mum giggled in his mind's ear. "This may not be the right time, but I'm very happy for you two." Through their connection, he could sense her mother saying something similar.
妈妈在他脑海中轻声笑道：“或许现在说这个不太合适，但我真心为你们俩感到高兴。”通过他们之间的纽带，他能感受到母亲也在表达类似的情感。

Just as he was about to wonder if their mothers were able to communicate with each other, Doctor Akagi interrupted the moment. "The two Angels have reached Terminal Dogma's floor."
就在他即将思索两位母亲是否能彼此交流之际，赤木博士打断了这一刻。"两位使徒已经到达了最终教条的楼层。"

Tabris and Bardiel stared up at the giant doors blocking their path towards Father. The time was almost upon them. For Bardiel, now starting to sweat and pant, he could at least die under the gaze of the one who gave him life instead of hidden away in the Lilim's fortress. For Tabris, his duty was to join with Father to, somewhat regretfully, wipe the Lilim away and claim this planet for his own people.
塔布里斯与巴迪尔仰望着那扇巨大的门，它阻挡了他们通往父亲的道路。关键时刻即将到来。巴迪尔已开始汗流浃背、气喘吁吁，他宁愿在赋予他生命的存在眼前死去，也不愿躲藏在莉莉姆的堡垒中。至于塔布里斯，他的使命是与父亲联手，虽有些遗憾，但必须消灭莉莉姆，为自己的族群夺取这颗星球。

Well, mostly regretfully. He would certainly shed no tears over ending the existence of the men who sent him here, thinking they could control him to bring about their scenario.
嗯，多半带着遗憾。对于那些自以为能操控他来达成目的而将他送到此地的人，他绝不会因结束他们的存在而感到悲伤。

"Are we going to just smash our way in?" asked Bardiel. "I won't be able to help as I am now."
我们打算就这样硬闯进去吗？" 巴迪尔问道，"以我目前的情况，恐怕帮不上什么忙。

"No, there is no need for that," replied Tabris. Originally he had intended to commandeer one of the pieces of Father's flesh and bring it down here, since they supposedly had the codes to access this place, but during his 'employment' a much easier way had made itself known. "All we need to do is ask."
不，那倒不必，"塔布里斯回应说。原本他计划夺取父亲身体的一部分带下来，因为它们据称掌握着进入这里的密码，但在他受雇期间，一个更为简便的方法显露了出来。"我们只需提出请求就行了。

"Ask?" 问一下？

"Yes. Like this." Tabris stepped towards the panel that he had no chance of guessing the code for. "Could you let us in?"
对，就像这样。" 塔布里斯走向那块他无从猜测密码的面板。"能帮我们开门吗？

The panel had no apparent means of detecting a voice at all. Yet, somehow, the screen flashed green and the doors slowly began to groan open. Tabris turned to grin at Bardiel, who could only stare back in confusion.
控制面板看似全无检测声音的功能，但屏幕却莫名闪现绿光，大门随之缓缓开启，发出沉闷的吱嘎声。塔布里斯转向巴迪尔，露出一抹得意的笑容，而巴迪尔则一脸茫然地回望着他。

"Is one of the Lilim a turncoat?" Bardiel guessed.
Bardiel 猜测道：‘Lilim 中是否有人变节了？’

"No, not at all," replied Tabris, before turning back to the panel. "It's one of us. Right, Ireul?"
不，根本不是，"塔布里斯回应后，转回控制面板。"是我们的人。对吧，伊鲁尔？

The panel flashed once more before going dark.
面板再次闪烁了一下，随后便暗了下来。

"And now, the MAGI is probably attempting to eradicate them for good," Tabris continued. "But they managed to perform one last act that... will..."
此刻，MAGI 或许正试图将他们彻底根除，"塔布里斯接着说。"然而，他们完成了最后一搏，此举将……

The doors were now open enough for them to see into the chamber. A giant white figure hung from a cross by bolts driven into its hands. A giant white figure that was absolutely not who Tabris was here for.
门已敞开到足以窥见室内，只见一尊巨大的白色身影被钉在十字架上，螺栓贯穿其双手。但这绝非塔布里斯所寻之人。

"What is this?" Bardiel hissed angrily. "Why is she here? Where is Father?!"
这是什么情况？"巴迪尔怒气冲冲地问道，"她为何在此？父亲去哪了？

"I... don't know." For once in his life, Tabris was utterly baffled. How could this be? Had NERV somehow managed to trick every single Angel into coming here by using the Betrayer, not Father? Frowning, he stepped into the chamber and began to look around. Most of the floor was dominated by large trenches and holes, seemingly arranged in some sort of pattern. As he drew closer, he saw just what they contained.
"我...真的不清楚。" 塔布里斯生平首次感到如此迷茫。这究竟是怎么一回事？难道 NERV 利用了背叛者，而非父亲，巧妙地引诱所有使徒聚集于此？他眉头紧锁，步入室内，环顾四周。地面大部分被巨大的沟壑和洞穴占据，看似遵循某种布局。当他靠近时，才看清了其中的秘密。

Corpses. Old, rotten bodies similar to the false flesh sent against his brethren, but with only the barest fraction of an echo of Father. Tabris reached out, attempting to manipulate that echo, but the corpse piles did not so much as shudder. They had certainly been down here a very long time.
尸体。古老而腐烂的躯体，与曾用来对付他兄弟们的假肉相似，却只带着父亲微弱回响的极小部分。塔布里斯试图操控那微弱的回响，但尸堆毫无反应。它们显然在此已久置岁月。

"Disgusting," Bardiel spat, his weary eyes taking everything in. "We would be doing them a favour if we merged with her, even if it would not continue our lineage."
真是令人作呕，"巴迪尔啐道，疲惫的双眼审视着一切。"即便这无法延续我们的血脉，与她融合也算是帮了他们一把。

"I am starting to consider it myself," Tabris replied, looking up at the Betrayer herself.
"我也在开始考虑这个问题了，"塔布里斯说着，抬头望向那位背叛者。

SEELE had to have known she was here, and yet they had claimed it was Father that was drawing in his brethren. That it was Father constantly tugging at his mind, even from deep inside SEELE's facility, urging him to do whatever it took to reach Him.
SEELE 必然知晓她在此地，然而他们却坚称是父亲在召唤他的同胞。是父亲从 SEELE 设施的深处不断牵动他的心神，催促他不顾一切地寻找他。

The sound of heavy footsteps drew their attention away from the macabre scene. Tabris and Bardiel turned around to see two giants heading right for them. Tabris held up a hand towards them and projected his barrier outward towards the doorway. The Evangelions smacked into it, causing the barrier to flare into visibility. Unit-01 began trying to punch its way through, while Unit-02 manifested its own barrier -barriers- to try and push through. Though he could feel some strain from the attack, Tabris had managed to buy some time to think about what to do.
沉重的脚步声将他们的注意力从那恐怖的场景中转移开。塔布里斯和巴迪尔转身一看，只见两个巨人正朝他们冲来。塔布里斯举起一只手，向门口方向释放出他的屏障。使徒们撞上了屏障，使其光芒四射，显露出形状。初号机开始试图用拳头打破屏障，而二号机则施展出自己的屏障，试图强行突破。尽管塔布里斯能感受到攻击带来的压力，但他成功争取到了思考对策的时间。

"Are you going to fight them?" asked Bardiel. "I can't do a damn thing as I am."
你打算与他们战斗吗？"巴迪尔问道。"我现在这副模样，根本无能为力。

Tabris stared at the behemoths for a moment, then sighed. "No, there is no point. We have failed at the last. Any attempt now would simply delay the inevitable. Besides..." He glanced up and to the right. "Strong as they are, with their light shining so brightly, they're still not the most dangerous enemy who has us in their sights."
塔布里斯凝视着那些庞然大物，片刻后叹息道：“不，已经没有意义了。我们终究功亏一篑。此刻再做尝试，不过是徒劳地推迟终局。而且……”他目光转向右上方。“尽管它们强大无比，光芒四射，但它们并非最危险的敌人，那个已经将我们锁定为目标的真正威胁。”

Bardiel followed his gaze. Up on a platform, glaring down at them, was what looked like a blue-haired Lilim, but he could sense her aura as powerfully as if she were standing right next to them. And unlike the giant slumbering on the cross behind them, she looked all too ready and eager to erase them from existence.
巴迪尔顺着他的视线看去。高台上，一位蓝发女子正俯视着他们，她的气场强烈到仿佛就站在他们身旁。与背后十字架上沉睡的巨人不同，她显得异常渴望并准备好将他们彻底抹除。

"Well," he remarked, turning his attention back to the red and purple giants. "What now?"
那么，" 他说着，目光重新投向那些红紫色的巨人，"接下来该如何是好？

"...We hope to die with some dignity," was the simple answer from Tabris, dropping his hand back to his side.
"……我们希望在生命的尽头能保有一些尊严。" 塔布里斯回答得很简单，说完便将手垂回身侧。

XXX

The AT-Field vanished, and the two Evangelions stumbled forward at the sudden lack of resistance. They quickly recovered and carefully approached the two Angels, Unit-01 staying slightly behind Unit-02 but keeping its weapon trained on them. Their mothers were urging caution as well.
绝对领域消散后，两台福音战士因突如其来的阻力消失而向前踉跄。它们很快稳住身形，谨慎地向两台使徒靠近，初号机略微落后于零号机，但始终保持武器瞄准。与此同时，他们的母亲也在提醒他们要小心谨慎。

He paused upon entering the room, slowly looking around. He... knew this place. The moment he noticed the giant on the cross was when it clicked. This was what he had seen during the disastrous attempt to dual sync with Rei. What she had almost begged him to stay quiet about. She had to remind him that now wasn't the time to worry about it. There was a much more immediate problem.
他踏入房间的那一刻，脚步不由自主地停了下来，目光缓缓扫过四周。他...对这个地方有印象。直到他瞥见那座巨大十字架上的雕像，记忆才如电光火石般闪现。这正是他与零号机进行灾难性双同步尝试时所目睹的场景。那是她曾近乎哀求他保持沉默的秘密。此刻，她不得不再次提醒他，眼下并非深究此事之时，一个更为迫切的难题正摆在眼前。

'Nagisa' slowly raised his hands above his head, indicating to whatever was puppeteering Kensuke's body to do the same. Despite the apparent display of surrender, they were still suspicious. Their targets were Angels, after all, even if they weren't showing hostility. 'Nagisa' had managed to put up an incredibly strong AT-Field that even she had not been able to do anything about. Before, the monsters they had destroyed had been just that: monsters. But what was in front of them now were two thinking, reasoning beings. They still looked like their friend and fellow pilot, and the friendly, approachable technician that had watched over him. Destroying an attacking creature was one thing, but killing a person that was now surrendering?
'渚薰'慢慢举起双手过头，暗示操控着真嗣身体的神秘力量也跟着做。虽然看似投降，他们依旧疑心重重。他们的目标是使徒，即使对方未显露敌意。'渚薰'竟能展开连她都无计可施的强大 AT 力场。过去他们消灭的不过是怪物，而面前这两位却是会思考、有理智的生命体。他们依旧保持着朋友和同僚的模样，以及那位亲切、可信赖的技术员形象。摧毁攻击性生物是一回事，但杀死正在投降的人呢？

They both decided to kick the problem upstairs. "Command, this is Unit-02. The Angels are surrendering. What are our orders?"
他们俩决定把问题推给上级处理。“指挥部，这里是 Unit-02。天使们表示投降。我们应如何应对？”

The only response they got was a hissing radio. She tried repeating the request, and even adjusting the comm unit, but nothing worked. It looked like it was purely up to them to make a call on what to do. But here was where their opinions differed. She thought they had to be eliminated immediately, while he couldn't stand the thought of killing a friend, even if they had been taken over by an Angel.
他们仅有的回应来自一台嘶嘶作响的无线电。她多次尝试发送请求，甚至调整了通讯设备，却毫无效果。似乎只能由他们自己来决定下一步行动。然而，他们的意见在此出现了分歧。她主张应立即清除威胁，而他则难以接受杀害被使徒侵占的朋友这一事实。

But Kensuke was dead, she insisted. The Angel killed him when it took over his Evangelion, and now it was merely wearing his skin. NERV had tried everything they could to recover him without success.
她坚称，Kensuke 已死。使徒接管他的 Evangelion 时将他杀害，如今只是披着他的外皮。NERV 竭尽全力试图救回他，却未能成功。

Unit-01 surged forward. The other Angel barely had time to express shock before it was grabbed in a giant purple hand and brought up to the Evangelion's face. Deciding to just go with it, she did the same to 'Nagisa'.
单元 01 猛地向前冲去。另一只使徒几乎来不及流露出惊愕之情，便被一只巨大的紫色手紧紧抓住，举到了福音战士的面前。她决定顺其自然，也对“渚薰”采取了同样的行动。

"Is our friend still alive?" he demanded of the struggling Angel in his grip. It briefly halted, glaring back at him with bright red eyes, but did not answer.
"我们的朋友是否还活着？"他紧握着挣扎的天使，厉声问道。天使一时停顿，用那双鲜红的眼睛回瞪着他，却未发一言。

"Yes, but also no," 'Nagisa' spoke instead, drawing the gaze of both Evangelions. He seemed almost relaxed in Unit-02's hand. "His soul may still remain in that body, but even if Bardiel were able to vacate it, your friend would not return to life."
是的，但也是否定的，"渚薰开口说道，吸引了两台福音战士的目光。他似乎在二号机的手中显得异常从容。"他的灵魂或许仍留存于那具躯体之中，但即便巴迪尔能够撤离，你的朋友也无法复活。

"This body is also degrading quickly," said Bardiel. "Even if your friend were able to revive, he would not stay that way for long. There is only an hour or two at best before the body will expire, along with me." The hand holding Bardiel clenched slightly, drawing a groan of pain out of him.
"这个身体正在迅速衰败，"巴迪尔说道，"即便你的朋友得以复活，也难以持久。至多一两个小时后，这具身体将彻底消亡，我也将随之而去。"此时，紧握巴迪尔的手微微用力，引得他发出一声痛楚的呻吟。

Unit-02 glanced up at the giant on the cross. "Is that why you came down here?" she asked. "To merge with... that?"
二号单位仰望着十字架上的巨人，问道：“你来这里，就是为了和……那个合为一体吗？”

"We could have," said 'Nagisa', "but the Betrayer is not truly why our brethren came here. She drew us in, under the mistaken belief that she was actually our Father." He stole a glance behind him at the giant and chuckled. "Unfortunately, it seems that the Lilim are just as capable of deceit as their progenitor. SEELE made me believe it was Father, and so I walked right into their trap."
我们原本可以，"濑户说道，"但背叛者并非我们同胞来此的真正原因。她诱使我们，错误地认为她就是我们的父亲。"他偷偷回头看了看那巨人，不禁轻笑。"遗憾的是，莉莉姆似乎和她们的创造者一样擅长欺骗。SEELE 让我误以为是父亲，结果我便中了他们的圈套。

"SEELE?" they both said together.
"SEELE？" 两人异口同声地说。

"A bunch of old men who believe they run the world," Tabris explained. "I was... created in one of their labs and prepared to infiltrate NERV to, as I thought, merge with Father when the opportunity presented itself. Had it been so, this planet would have been scythed clean of Lilim and our species would be reborn."
一群自诩为世界主宰的老人，"塔布里斯解释说，"我诞生于他们的实验室，原本计划潜入 NERV，伺机与父亲融合。若真能实现，地球上的莉莉姆将被一扫而空，我们的种族将迎来新生。

"But what does this SEELE want?" he asked. "Why would they raise you just to send you here to die?"
但 SEELE 究竟有何目的？"他追问。"他们培养你，难道就是为了让你来此赴死？

Tabris closed his eyes and sighed. "Because they want Third Impact on their terms. And as I now see, one of the last steps in that plan is ensuring I and all my brethren are dead so that we can't interfere."
塔布里斯闭上双眼，深深叹息。"因为他们希望按照自己的意愿引发第三次冲击。如今我清楚地看到，这个计划中的关键一步就是确保我和我的同胞们全部丧生，以免我们介入其中。"

"Huh. Well wouldn't it just be a nice 'fuck you' to SEELE if we kept you alive?" she mused.
"哼，要是我们让你活下来，岂不是对 SEELE 最好的'去你的'？"她若有所思地说。

"You could leave me alive, but the... urge is rooted deep in the mind. Even if it's the Betrayer that drew me in, I could no more resist than a Lilim could hold their breath."
你本可以让我活着，但那股...冲动根深蒂固。即使是因为背叛者的诱惑，我也无法抗拒，正如莉莉姆无法憋气一样。

"You will destroy them." 你会毁灭他们。

All eyes were drawn to the platform where Rei stood, still wearing her hospital gown. Even from this distance the pilots could see her glowing faintly.
众人的目光齐聚于平台，零身着医院病服静立其上，即便相隔甚远，飞行员们亦能察觉到她身上隐约的光芒。

He began to speak "...Rei? Are you-"
他开口道：“...Rei？你在吗？”

Rei interrupted him. "Destroy them," she angrily repeated, her voice filling the entire room, sounding like two people talking at once. "They cannot be allowed to survive."
蕾伊打断了他：“消灭他们！”她愤怒地重复着，声音响彻整个房间，仿佛两个人在同时说话。“绝不能让他们活下去。”

They stared at her, confused at both the way she was speaking and what she was saying. He knew now that Rei and this being on the cross -Lilith- were connected. She had just recently learned that Rei had been partially created from Lilith's DNA. Rei had never acted like this before, even when fighting an Angel. There was also the fact that she was demanding that they kill two surrendering enemies, one that was, essentially, their friend.
他们困惑地凝视着她，对她说话的方式和内容都感到不解。他此刻意识到，绫波与十字架上的存在——莉莉丝——有着某种联系。她最近才知晓，绫波的部分基因源自莉莉丝。绫波以往从未有过这样的行为，即便在对抗使徒时也不例外。更令人震惊的是，她居然要求他们处决两名已投降的敌人，其中一人实质上是他们的朋友。

"Will somebody hurry up and kill me?" Bardiel growled. "I refuse to die slowly, frail and wheezing! End it now!"
谁能快点结束我的生命？" 巴迪尔怒吼，"我不要这样缓慢、虚弱地死去，喘息着！立刻了结我吧！

"It's alright," said Tabris. "My life was forfeit the moment I started on this path. SEELE tricked me, and so I give you what little information I can. You now know of their existence, and their plan. Presumably they will act soon, when they receive word of my demise."
没关系，"塔布里斯说道，"自从我走上这条路，我的生命便已注定。SEELE 欺骗了我，我只能提供这些有限的信息。你现已知晓他们的存在及其计划。一旦他们得知我的死讯，估计很快就会有所行动。

He closed his eyes, hand trembling around the body it enclosed. They had not even had a chance to say goodbye to their friend. Through their link, he felt her own reluctance to so unceremoniously erase a life, but she understood it had to be done to keep everyone safe. They focused on their link and, as one...
他闭上双眼，手颤抖着环绕着怀中的身体。他们连向朋友道别的机会都没有。通过他们之间的纽带，他感受到她同样不愿如此草率地结束一个生命，但她深知为了众人的安全，这一步不得不走。他们凝神于彼此的纽带，然后一同...

Two giant hands clenched tight.
两只巨手紧紧地攥着。

XXX

Unit-02 went up the elevator first. Despite its speedy ascent and return it still felt like hours before Shinji finally stepped out of the entry plug. Doctor Akagi was waiting on the gantry, but there were no technicians standing by for after-battle procedures. Only Asuka, walking in from her cage, and-
二号机率先搭乘电梯上升。尽管其上升和返回迅速，真嗣从插入栓中走出的那一刻，仍让人感觉仿佛过了许久。赤木博士在步道上等候，但周围并无技术人员准备战后程序。唯有明日香，从她的驾驶舱中走出，还有——

"Shinji." 真嗣。

His father, giving him the slightest of nods.
他的父亲，只是轻轻地点了点头。

"We must debrief the two of you at once," said Doctor Akagi. "We lost contact while you were down there and we need to know what happened immediately. And of course... well, you know. You saw it down there."
我们必须立刻向你们两位进行汇报，"阿贺基博士说道。"你们在地下时我们失去了联系，急需了解当时的情况。而且...你们也清楚，你们亲眼目睹了那一切。

Normally Asuka would have retorted with a complaint about drying LCL ruining her hair, but this time she remained silent and serious. She brushed past everyone and grabbed Shinji by the hand, pulling him towards the exit. They both ignored Doctor Akagi calling out to them.
往常，明日香定会抱怨干燥的 LCL 损害她的秀发，然而这次她却沉默而严肃。她匆匆穿过人群，一把抓住真嗣的手，拽着他向出口走去。两人对赤木博士的呼唤置若罔闻。

Shinji didn't recall much of the next few minutes. When he finally began to notice things again, he was in one of the changing rooms. After a few blinks he realised he was sitting slumped over on a bench, with Asuka's arm around him holding tight. Her other hand was busy fidgeting with the necklace that she had put on over the plugsuit. His father was standing nearby, regal and imposing, with his hands behind his back. Unbeknownst to Shinji, the man's eyes, hidden behind his orange glasses, kept darting from him to the necklace.
真嗣对接下来几分钟的记忆很模糊。当他终于开始注意到周围时，他发现自己在一个更衣室里。眨了几下眼后，他意识到自己正瘫坐在长凳上，明日香的手臂紧紧地搂着他。她的另一只手正忙着摆弄她戴在插入栓服外的项链。他的父亲站在附近，威严而庄重，双手背在身后。真嗣未察觉的是，那个男人的眼睛，藏在橙色眼镜后面，不断地从他身上扫向那条项链。

Doctor Akagi was nowhere to be seen, but Rei was sitting on the bench next to Father, quietly observing Shinji and Asuka. Shinji half-expected her to make some sort of gesture that he should stay quiet about what happened, but her hands remained folded in her lap.
赤木医生不见踪影，而丽坐在父亲旁边的长椅上，默默地注视着真嗣和明日香。真嗣本以为她会用手势暗示他保密，但她只是双手交叠，静静地放在膝上。

Shinji shook himself and sat up straight. "Sorry, Father," he murmured. "We just had to..."
真嗣摇摇头，挺直了背。“抱歉，爸爸，”他轻声道。“我们只是必须这么做……”

Father nodded as he trailed off. "Clearly you have just gone through something more traumatic than usual. We will do the debriefing here.
父亲点头表示理解，声音渐渐低沉：“显然你刚经历的事情比往常更为严重。我们就在此进行汇报。”

"Now then, tell me everything."
那么，把一切都告诉我吧。

### Chapter 46 Instrumentality Awaits
人类补完计划即将启动

Misato stared up at the ceiling, absorbing everything she had just been told.
三笠抬头凝视天花板，默默消化着刚刚得知的所有信息。

She hadn't realised just how stupid it was to quit drinking cold turkey, especially after a lifetime of trying to destroy her liver. She certainly hadn't expected hallucinations to be part of it. Only now, a few days after her disastrous journey into the depths of NERV,was she being allowed visitors.
她未曾意识到，在长期酗酒试图毁掉自己肝脏后突然戒酒是多么不明智。更没想到会因此产生幻觉。直到此刻，经历了那场灾难性的 NERV 内部之旅几天后，她才获准接待访客。

"So," she said after an indeterminate amount of time. "We're going to be attacked again, sometime soon, by forces we don't know anything about yet."
所以，" 她沉默了一会儿后说，"我们不久后将再次面临攻击，对手是谁，我们尚不清楚。

"That's about the size of it," replied Asuka. Shinji had one arm around her shoulders; apparently he was still suffering the effects of the Sixteenth Angel's attack. Still, if the current situation wasn't so dire Misato would have gently ribbed them, before finally getting around to congratulating the new couple. Though they didn't seem to be... synchronised or whatever at the moment, they were still shifting and fidgeting much the same way, although Asuka did occasionally bring a hand up to her necklace.
"差不多就是这样，"阿苏卡回应道。真嗣的一只手搭在她的肩上，显然还在承受第十六使徒攻击的余波。若非形势紧迫，三佐或许会轻描淡写地逗弄他们一番，再向这对新恋人道贺。尽管他们此刻并未完全同步，但两人的动作和不安却如出一辙，阿苏卡还不时抚摸着自己的项链。

"My father certainly seemed to take it seriously," said Shinji. "He didn't tell us anything besides to be ready at a moment's notice, though."
真嗣说：'我父亲对此显然很认真。他只告诉我们要随时准备，其他什么也没说。'

"No, but he would have a better idea what to expect," said Misato. "He's probably preparing whatever he can to try and counter the attack. And this time, it won't be an Angel."
不，但他对即将到来的情况应该有更清晰的预判，" 米萨托说道。"他大概正在竭尽所能准备应对措施。这次，敌人并非使徒。

"How are you so sure?" asked Asuka.
"你为何如此肯定？" 阿苏卡问道。

"Because-" Misato cut herself off, her eyes flicking to a corner of the ceiling where a camera sat, before deciding it didn't matter at this point. "I got my hands on some information that was hidden deep in NERV's systems. If that data is accurate, there are only supposed to be seventeen Angels. One that was at the South Pole, the one sitting below us, and the fifteen that were killed over the past several months."
因为——" 碇真嗣话音未落，目光突然转向天花板角落的摄像头，随即又觉得此刻这无关紧要。"我设法从 NERV 的深层系统中挖出了一些隐秘信息。若这些数据无误，原本应只有十七个使徒。一个位于南极，我们脚下这个，再加上过去数月间被歼灭的十五个。

"What?" the teenagers said together. Asuka continued alone. "The Angels are all defeated? Already?!"
什么？" 几个青少年异口同声。明日香接着独自追问："天使们全都被打败了？这么快？

Misato shrugged as best as she could while handcuffed to the bed. "I'm honestly as surprised about that as you are, Asuka."
碇真嗣被铐在床上，勉强耸了耸肩。“说实话，我对这件事的惊讶程度不亚于你，明日香。”

"This has to be a joke or something!" Asuka fumed. She looked about ready to start stomping her feet. "I didn't spend a decade training to be an Eva pilot just to be rendered useless in a fraction of that time!"
这肯定是个玩笑吧！" 明日香气愤地说，一副要跺脚的样子。"我可不是花了十年时间训练成为 Eva 驾驶员，就为了让这一切在短短几年内变得毫无价值！

"...You do realise that when the Angels are gone, humanity's going to start arguing with itself again, don't you?" Misato quietly asked, grimly reminded of how little it took for that to happen. And with a weapon like the Evangelion...
"...你难道不明白，使徒一旦消失，人类又将陷入内斗，不是吗？" 碇真嗣轻声问道，深感这种事情轻易就会发生。而拥有像 EVA 这样的武器...

"We will not fight other people," Shinji resolutely stated.
"我们不会与他人战斗，" 碇真嗣坚定地表示。

"What he said," added Asuka. "Even if it means I won't be an Eva pilot, I'm not going to kill people just because some rich fat asshole got his feelings hurt by some other rich fat asshole."
他说的那些话，" 阿苏卡接着说，"就算我因此不再是 Eva 驾驶员，我也不会因为某个有钱的胖子被另一个有钱的胖子惹恼了就去杀人。

Misato smirked. "I'd expect nothing less from you two. Not like your Evas will accept anyone else anyway." She turned serious. "Someone might try and force you though. Kidnap someone like a family member, make you do their bidding that way."
碇真嗣嘴角勾起一抹笑意：“你俩这样我一点也不意外。毕竟你们的 Eva 也不会接受其他人。”随即她神情一正，“不过，可能有人会试图逼迫你们。比如绑架你们的亲人，以此来迫使你们就范。”

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other. An entire conversation seemed to play out just in their eye contact. Eventually they both turned back to Misato.
真嗣与明日香目光交汇，仿佛通过眼神完成了一场无声的对话。随后，两人一同将视线转向了美里。

"We'll deal with that when and if it happens," said Asuka.
Asuka 说：'如果真的发生了，我们到时候再处理。'

"There's no point worrying right now," Shinji added. "We still need to get through the next few days first."
眼下担心无济于事，" 真嗣接着说，"我们得先熬过这几天再说。

"Understandable, you've got enough on your plate right now." Misato shifted around on the bed as best as she could, wondering when the handcuffs would finally get removed. Regardless of everything else, NERV would clearly need its tactical operations officer soon. "Anyway, apart from the imminent attack by an ancient and secret organisation... how have things been?"
明白，你手头的事情已经够多了。" 美里在床上尽力挪动，心里盼着何时能摘掉手铐。尽管如此，NERV 显然很快就需要其战术行动官。"抛开即将到来的古老秘密组织的攻击不谈...最近情况怎么样？

They looked at each other again.
他们又彼此对视了一眼。

"Oh it's been going just fine," said Asuka with a roll of her eyes. "With no television or games, or even school to occupy us when we're not training, we're bored out of our skulls. Doctor Akagi suggested looking at paperwork when we asked if there was anything to read."
哦，一切还算顺利，"飞鸟说着翻了个白眼。"没有电视、游戏，连学校也不去，除了训练外我们闲得发慌。当我们询问有什么可读时，赤木博士提议我们翻阅文件。

"This place is too much of a maze to go for a walk, too," Shinji added. "Well... a stumble for me since I still can't walk properly. For whatever reason there's no physical therapists available either, so I can't even begin rehabilitation."
这地方复杂得像迷宫，连散步都不合适，" 真嗣接着说，"对我而言，只能算是蹒跚前行，因为我走路还不稳。不知什么原因，这里连物理治疗师都找不到，我连康复训练都无从谈起。

"You have excess energy and no outlet," said Misato, understanding them perfectly. "Why not go out to the cavern area? Plenty of space to get away from things while still being close in case of an emergency. Just tell Ritsuko or one of the bridge officers, get a Section Two car assigned, and keep your phones with you." She rattled the handcuffs. "As you can see, I can't really be in charge of you right now."
你精力充沛却无处宣泄，" 美里深表理解地说，"不妨去洞窟区吧？那里空间宽敞，既能远离纷扰，又便于紧急时迅速应对。只需通知律子或某位舰桥军官，安排一辆第二部门的车辆，并记得带上手机。" 她摇了摇手铐，"你看，我现在确实无法照顾你们。

"I guess that works," Asuka said with a shrug. "Alright then, we'll be back later." A corner of her mouth curved upwards. "Don't go anywhere."
我想这办法可行，" 明日香耸肩说道，"那好，我们稍后再来。" 她嘴角勾起一抹微笑，"别乱跑哦。

Misato snorted and waved them off, staring at their backs as the door closed. Not even a minute later, the door opened again and she was about to ask what the kids had forgotten, only they were joined by somebody else.
美里轻哼一声，挥手示意他们走开，目光紧随他们直至门扉合拢。不出一分钟，门又开启，她正欲询问孩子们遗忘了何物，却见他们身后还跟着一人。

"Hello Misato," said Ritsuko, hands in the pockets of her lab coat. "How are you feeling?"
美里，你好，" 理子说着，双手插在实验服的口袋里。"你感觉如何？

Misato cast a wary eye over her friend before responding. "Physically? Not too bad, although I'd really prefer to go to the bathroom properly instead of through a tube."
真嗣用怀疑的目光打量了一下朋友，随后答道：“身体方面？还过得去，只是我更希望能正常如厕，而不是依赖导管。”

"Well then good news." One of Ritsuko's hands came out into the open, holding a key. "Commander Ikari ordered you be released, considering the situation."
好消息来了。" 里津子伸出手，手中握着一把钥匙。"伊卡里指挥官鉴于当前形势，已下令释放你。

"That's something at least," Misato muttered, rubbing her wrists once they were free of the cuffs. Spotting Asuka out of the corner of her eye, and remembering what she had just said, Misato stuck her tongue out at the girl.
"至少还有点安慰，" 碇真嗣喃喃自语，揉搓着解脱了手铐束缚的手腕。眼角余光捕捉到明日香的身影，想起她刚才的话语，碇真嗣调皮地向她吐了吐舌头。

"You're still staying here though," Ritsuko continued, shattering Misato's victorious expression, "but at least when the attack happens you don't have to wait for someone to come along and let you out."
尽管如此，你还是留在这里，" 律子接着说，打破了美里得意的表情，"至少袭击发生时，你不用干等着别人来开门。

Asuka stuck her tongue out at Misato before the two kids left again.
两个孩子再次离开前，明日香对美里做了个鬼脸。

"Should I ask?" said Ritsuko.
"我该问吗？"丽月问道。

"Just the kids being kids for once." Misato sighed. "They're going to have to kill people soon, aren't they?"
难得孩子们能像普通孩子一样。" 碇真嗣叹息道。"他们不久就得去杀人了，对吧？

Ritsuko nodded slowly. "That's the most likely outcome."
律子慢慢地点头表示同意。"这应该是最有可能的结果。"

"But if they don't, then the bastards coming for us are going to murder everyone in the Geofront."
但如果他们不采取行动，那些追杀我们的家伙将会在 Geofront 屠尽所有人。

"Almost certainly." 几乎可以肯定。

"Tell me NERV has been working on how to fight back."
告诉我 NERV 一直在研究反击的方法。

"We are. NERV is on yellow alert, but things aren't too great for us. Our funding has been cut several times over the last few months, and we only have some of the topside defenses back online after the hammering they took from the Fourteenth."
我们是 NERV，现处于黄色警戒状态，但形势对我们并不乐观。近几个月来，我们的经费屡遭削减，且在与第十四使徒交战后受损的地面防御系统，目前仅部分恢复了功能。

Misato frowned. "Any assault force will know exactly where they are along with the sensor outposts, so we can't rely on them for very long. Best we can do is seal all the entrances."
真嗣皱眉说：“任何进攻部队都会准确掌握他们的位置和传感器哨所，因此我们无法长期依赖这些哨所。我们最该做的就是封死所有入口。”

"Even that wouldn't last long enough," Ritsuko countered. "They'll just cut or blast their way in."
即便如此，也撑不了多久，" 律子反驳说，"他们肯定会破门而入。

"Well then let's go over what we can do."
那我们就来梳理一下可以采取的行动。

Nobody questioned the three pilots on their decision to requisition a Section Two car and escort, not even when the agents saw where they were going. That suited Shinji and Asuka just fine. If times were quieter, though, they would have chosen to simply tell somebody where they were going and walk out here on their own. As it was, it would have taken far too long for him to make it here with his body being so uncooperative, even with Asuka's help.
三位飞行员决定征用二号部门的车辆和护卫，对此无人提出质疑，即便特工们目睹了他们的目的地。这对真嗣和明日香而言再好不过。若非紧急时刻，他们或许会选择告知他人去向，然后自行徒步前往。然而，鉴于真嗣的身体状况不佳，即便有明日香协助，要抵达目的地也显得过于耗时。

There didn't seem to be anything the doctors could do to help. Apart from the veins still standing out all over his body, nothing actually appeared to be wrong with him according to them. The best they could say was that he might fully recover.
医生们似乎束手无策，除了他身上依旧明显的静脉外，他们认为他并无大碍。最好的情况是，他有望完全康复。

Rei got out of the car first and headed towards the patch of watermelons. She stared at the slowly growing plants, trying to fix in her mind that she had been the one that had helped. That she had been the one to hold the seeds in her hand and place them in the ground. Most of her memories of her past life had firmly seated themselves, but along with them came doubt.
零第一个下车，径直走向西瓜地。她注视着那些慢慢生长的西瓜苗，心中努力铭记，正是她亲手将种子埋入土壤。关于前世的记忆大多已深深扎根，然而，伴随这些记忆的还有挥之不去的疑虑。

One of the biggest issues facing her was that her fate was fast approaching. Even this new body was living on borrowed time. Regardless of what she chose to do when the time soon arrived, Rei Ayanami would eventually perish. And now, with her backups gone, it would be her final death.
她面临的一大难题是，命运的脚步正急速逼近。即便拥有了新的身体，也不过是暂借时光。无论她即将做出何种选择，绫波丽终将迎来生命的终结。如今，备份已失，这将是她真正的永别。

Commander Ikari wanted to be reunited with his wife, the woman that half of Rei's DNA came from. For that to happen, she would have to join with Lilith. Rei Ayanami would cease to exist, instead being consumed by her greater part. Perhaps Lilith would retain her memories, but they would be a speck of sand on a beach.
碇司令渴望与妻子重逢，她是绫波丽一半 DNA 的来源。为此，她需与莉莉丝合为一体。绫波丽将消失，被其更大部分吸收。莉莉丝或许会保留她的记忆，但那不过是沙滩中的一粒沙。

Should Rei Ayanami return to Lilith and initiate Instrumentality, saving humanity as a whole from the machinations of SEELE, even if it meant the end of her friends? Or should she instead refuse that fate, letting humanity -and her friends- live as individuals, along with being able to live as herself for a while longer, but with SEELE still looming, threatening to destroy everything?
绫波丽是否应回归莉莉丝，启动人类补完计划，以拯救全人类免遭 SEELE 的操控，即便这会导致她朋友的消逝？还是她应拒绝这一宿命，让人类及其友人继续以个体身份生存，同时她也能延长自己的生命，尽管 SEELE 的威胁依旧悬而未决？

"You alright, Wondergirl?"
你还好吧，神奇女孩？

Rei jumped at the sudden intrusion on her thoughts. She turned to see Shinji and Asuka, garden implements in hand, looking concernedly at her. It interested her that despite Shinji's condition, he still insisted on helping. "I am fine," she said. "Simply... thinking about the future, so to speak."
绫波丽被突然的打扰吓了一跳。她转过身，看到真嗣和明日香手里拿着园艺工具，正关切地望着她。她觉得有趣的是，尽管真嗣身体状况不佳，他还是坚持要帮忙。“我没事，”她回答，“只是在思考未来的事情。”

They nodded, remaining silent for a moment. Rei wasn't sure if they were currently synchronised with each other, but soon Asuka said, "It's something to do with that Lilith creature, isn't it?"
他们点头后沉默片刻。丽不确定他们是否心有灵犀，但不久明日香开口：“这事和那个叫莉莉丝的生物脱不了关系，对吧？”

"Yes," Rei confirmed. "That, and SEELE's goals. But please, let us not think of them at the moment. We have a more pleasant task to perform here, after all."
是的，" 丽确认道，"包括 SEELE 的目标。不过，现在我们先别想那些。毕竟，我们还有一项更令人愉快的任务要完成。

This time, the silence was much more melancholy as the teenagers set to work. Without Kaji to help they didn't have much of an idea for what to do beyond watering and weeding, or what to expect with the actual plants. It had only been a few weeks since the seeds were planted so there was still no sign of the fruit itself, just the leaves and what may have been the start of a flower here and there.
这次，少年们开始劳作时的沉默愈发沉重。失去了加治的指导，他们除了浇水和除草外，对接下来该做什么一头雾水，对植物的生长也毫无预期。种子播种不过数周，果实尚未露面，只有叶片和偶尔可见的花蕾初现。

Somewhat unfortunately, the job was over far too soon. Asuka and Shinji put the tools back in the shed while Rei brushed dirt from her hands and clothing, scanning the garden one last time for anything that may have been missed. Her thoughts drifted as she pondered whether the plants would survive if Instrumentality went ahead. Would they end up choked to death by weeds? Or would they perhaps spread throughout the cavern?
颇为遗憾的是，工作很快就结束了。明日香和真嗣将工具归置回棚内，而零则轻拍去手和衣物上的尘土，最后一次仔细检查花园，确保没有遗漏。她心绪飘渺，思索着若人类补完计划得以执行，这些植物是否能存活。它们会被杂草扼杀吗？亦或是可能蔓延至整个洞穴？

Asuka and Shinji suddenly appeared in Rei's peripheral vision, startling her slightly.
明日香和真嗣突然闯入绫波的余光中，令她微微一惊。

"It's time for us to go back," said Asuka. "Besides, I just realised Shinji and I should be getting in some tests and training if we're going to be fighting soon."
该回去了，"飞鸟说道，"而且我刚想到，真嗣和我得抓紧做些测试和训练，毕竟战斗在即。

"We can come out here again another time," Shinji added.
"我们还可以挑个时间再来这儿，" 真嗣接着说。

"Will you be alright in the Eva with your current condition?" asked Rei, looking him over and taking in the state of his body.
"你目前的状况驾驶 Eva 没问题吧？" 丽关切地询问，仔细审视着他的身体状态。

Shinji glanced down at his arms, a finger tracing the lines his veins made standing out against his skin. "My body may not be in the best shape, but then that doesn't really matter when it comes to an Eva, right?" he replied with a weak smile that quickly faded. "I still remember the condition you were in when we first met in Unit-01's cage all those months ago. Barely able to move, and yet you were still expected to pilot the Eva if I didn't."
真嗣低头凝视着自己的手臂，手指轻轻描摹着皮肤下凸显的静脉纹路。“我的身体状况或许不佳，但驾驶 Eva 时这并不重要，不是吗？”他带着一丝虚弱的微笑回应，笑容随即消散。“我还清晰记得数月前，我们在初号机舱内初次相遇时你的情形。你几乎无法动弹，却仍被期待着，若我不驾驶，你便要接替驾驶 Eva。”

Another memory from a previous life. Her body almost completely shattered, yet that could not be allowed to impede her duty. Even if she had died defeating the Third Angel, another would be along soon to take her place. Of course, that was no longer an option now, and there was no Evangelion for her to pilot anyway. Part of her, the part that resisted the thought of Instrumentality and her final death, resented her inability to help her friends fight.
前世记忆的又一碎片。她的身躯近乎粉碎，但这绝不能成为她履行职责的障碍。即便她牺牲在击败第三使徒的战斗中，很快也会有后来者接替她的位置。如今，这已不再可能，何况也没有福音战士供她驾驶。她内心深处，抗拒着人类补完计划和最终消亡的那部分，对自己无法助朋友一臂之力感到怨恨。

"Just like then, it is a matter of necessity," Rei said out loud.
"正如当时一样，这是必须的，" Rei 大声说道。

Shinji and Asuka both nodded. "At a time like this, it doesn't really matter how injured you are," said Asuka. "When your very existence is on the line, when someone is threatening to destroy you and everyone you care for, you pick up a weapon and damn well fight."
碇真嗣和明日香同时点头。“这种紧要关头，伤势轻重已无关紧要，”明日香说道。“当你的生存受到威胁，有人企图毁灭你和你所珍视的一切时，你会毫不犹豫地拿起武器，奋力抗争。”

That rebellious part started to get louder in the face of Asuka's declaration. Rei opened her mouth to reply, but swiftly snapped it shut as she sensed something familiar suddenly appear nearby.
在明日香的宣言面前，那股叛逆的情绪愈发高涨。绫波丽本欲开口回应，却突然察觉到附近出现了熟悉的气息，于是迅速闭口不言。

"Good day, you three." 你们三位，早上好。

All three teenagers turned to see a flame-haired woman in a business suit leaning against the shack.
三个少年同时回头，只见一位红发女子身着正装，倚靠在小屋边。

"Bwynvienne," Asuka and Shinji greeted together. Asuka continued alone. "I don't suppose you've come to lend a hand to us unfortunate mortals in the near future, have you?"
"Bwynvienne," Asuka 和 Shinji 一同问候道。Asuka 接着独自说：“你大概不会是来帮我们这些倒霉的凡人，在不久的将来吧？”

Bwynvienne pushed herself off the wall and began walking towards them, only to stop as she realised she was about to step on one of the plants. Rather than simply walk around, she disappeared and reappeared directly in front of them in the blink of an eye. She stared curiously at Rei for a moment before speaking.
布温维妮推开墙壁，正朝他们走去，突然意识到差点踩到一株植物，便停下了脚步。她并未选择绕道，而是瞬间消失，眨眼间又出现在他们面前。她好奇地凝视了雷一会儿，才开口说话。

"I'm afraid I come with some bad news," she announced. "And it's not just that I cannot help. The heads of the Infernal Administration have issued an embargo for Earth, meaning no agents will be allowed to come here for the foreseeable future."
我带来的消息恐怕不妙，"她宣布道。"而且，我无能为力。地狱行政部门的头头们已经对地球实施了禁令，这意味着在可预见的未来，不会有任何特工被允许来此。

"An embargo?" Shinji repeated. "Does the Administration know something about what's going to happen here?"
禁运？" 真嗣重复道。"政府是不是知道这里即将发生什么事？

"I don't know what's supposedly about to happen," Bwynvienne exasperatedly replied. "These orders come down from very far above me. I'm just one cog in an incredibly large and complicated machine."
我真不清楚即将发生什么，" Bwynvienne 无奈地回应。"这些指令来自我遥不可及的高层。我只是这台庞大复杂机器中的一个小小零件。

"Ah yes," said Asuka with a knowing nod. "'This is need-to-know and you don't need to know, just do what we say'."
啊，没错，" 明日香心领神会地点头说道，"'这事关紧要，你无需知晓，照我们说的做就行。'

Bwynvienne flicked a hand upward in frustrated acknowledgement. "Exactly. All I know is that that agents are being recalled, and once all relevant clients have been notified, travel to Earth will be disallowed for any reason until the heads say otherwise. Which... could very well be never depending on whatever they know."
布温维耶恩不耐烦地向上挥了挥手，表示无奈的认同。“确实如此。我只知道特工们正在被召回，一旦所有相关客户都已通知到位，任何理由都不允许前往地球，直到高层发话。而他们所知的情况……可能永远都不会允许。”

Asuka's eyes darted sideways to Shinji. "So that would potentially mean that, if they decide to write us off, the contract between us will be permanent?"
明日香的目光迅速转向真嗣，问道：“那是不是意味着，如果他们决定抛弃我们，我们之间的合同就将成为永久性的？”

"Afraid so," Bwynvienne confirmed. "With agents prevented from coming here, negotiations cannot proceed, and new contracts cannot be drafted. That five year limit on yours will pass, you'll be eligible for a new contract... but there won't be anyone to assist you."
确实如此，" Bwynvienne 确认说。"因为代理人来不了，谈判无法继续，新合同也签不成。你的合同五年期限快到了，本可以签新合同... 但那时没人能帮你了。

Shinji and Asuka's hands jumped towards each other as if magnetised. They looked at each other for a long moment before Shinji said, "Well, we've made it this far with our contract. It hasn't been easy in some cases, but in others-"
真嗣和明日香的手仿佛被磁铁吸引，不由自主地伸向对方。他们深深对视了一会儿，真嗣才缓缓说道：“看，我们的契约已经坚持到了现在。虽然有些时候挺艰难，但也有些时候……”

"-it helped save our lives," Asuka finished. "I would have died months ago if I didn't have Shinji's soul."
-它救了我们的命，" 明日香说道。"没有真嗣的灵魂，我早就没命了。

"It's given us some weird memories too," Shinji continued, a small smile appearing on his face. "Remember that spider Angel?"
它也给我们带来了一些奇异的回忆，" 真嗣接着说，嘴角微微上扬。"还记得那只蜘蛛使徒吗？

Matarael. The Angel that had appeared when the entirety of Tokyo-3 had lost power. It had managed to sneak up on them their friends, and had stared closely at the pilots as if unable to believe what it was seeing. Of course, then it had sensed the soul lurking within Rei's body and had decided to make a tactical retreat.
马特里尔。正是这个天使，在东京-3 陷入全面黑暗之际现身。它悄无声息地接近了他们和朋友们，紧盯着驾驶员们，眼中满是难以置信。然而，当它感知到绫波体内潜藏的灵魂后，便选择了战术性撤退。

Asuka was chuckling at the memory. "It was like watching a guy realise he was about to pick a fight with a giant and try to play it off like he was just walking away for a completely different reason."
明日香回忆起那场景，忍不住笑了起来。"那感觉就像某人猛然发现自己正要挑衅一个巨人，随即又假装只是因为别的原因而离开。"

"It has certainly been interesting to observe you when I could," said Bwynvienne, drawing everyone's attention back to her. "You two have also given the Administration quite a few headaches with your escapades, and no doubt there will soon be some adjustments being made."
能观察到你们的时候，确实挺有意思。" Bwynvienne 说道，再次将众人的注意力拉回到自己身上。"你们俩的种种行为已经让管理局头疼不已，相信不久就会有相应的调整措施出台。

She gave a deep bow; Shinji and Asuka returned the bow, and Rei found herself doing the same. As she straightened back up she noticed Bwynvienne's eyes staring unnervingly at her despite her attention staying on the other two. "It has been a joy to be your agent, Mister Ikari and Ms Soryu. If it happens that the embargo is permanent, I will be genuinely sad to never see you again. I sincerely hope that does not happen and that I will be able to assist you when your contract expires. Goodbye, all of you, and I hope to see you again someday."
她深深地鞠了一躬；真嗣和明日香也回以鞠躬，丽不自觉地跟着做了同样的动作。当她直起身子时，注意到布温维恩的目光正令人不安地盯着她，尽管她的注意力仍放在另外两人身上。“能担任你们的代理人，我感到非常荣幸，碇先生和惣流小姐。如果禁运成为永久性的，我将真心感到遗憾，因为可能再也见不到你们了。我衷心希望不会如此，并期待在你们的合同到期时能继续为你们服务。再见了，各位，愿将来我们还能重逢。”

The moment the last word left her mouth, the strange woman was gone. Asuka and Shinji stared at where she had been standing for a long moment before Asuka put Shinji's arm over her shoulders and began the slow trek back to the Section Two car. The agents had seemingly completely missed the presence of a tall woman with burning hair, possibly because they were looking towards the lake.
当那位神秘女子说完最后一个字后，她便消失了。明日香和真嗣愣愣地望着她刚才站立的地方，片刻后，明日香扶起真嗣，将他的手臂搭在自己肩上，两人缓缓向第二分部的车辆走去。特工们似乎完全没察觉到那位头发如火焰般燃烧的高挑女子，或许是因为他们的注意力都集中在湖面上。

Rei felt the mental equivalent of a tap on the shoulder, and realised that the strange sensation Bwynvienne carried with her had not actually vanished yet. She glanced behind her, and caught a glimpse of flames disappearing behind the shack. Her eyes flicked back to her friends for a moment, and then she headed towards the shack, out of sight of her friends and the agents.
蕾感觉到一种类似被人轻拍肩膀的心理暗示，意识到布温维恩身上那股奇异的感觉并未真正消散。她回头望去，只见火焰在棚屋后隐没。她短暂地看了看朋友们，然后便向棚屋走去，消失在朋友和特工们的视野中。

"You know what will happen, don't you?" she immediately asked of Bwynvienne, who was leaning against the wall.
"你清楚接下来会发生什么，对吧？"她随即向倚着墙的 Bwynvienne 发问。

"I can certainly hazard a guess," Bwynvienne replied. "The Administration doesn't just decide to embargo an entire planet on a whim. Every other time it's happened has been because of some kind of worldwide catastrophe that they don't want leaking through."
我当然可以大胆猜测，" Bwynvienne 回答说，"政府不会无缘无故地对整个星球实施禁运。以往每次这种情况发生，都是因为某种全球性灾难，他们不希望这些信息外泄。

Rei didn't understand much about Bwynvienne or the Infernal Administration, but she did not believe that they were lying. If they were preparing to leave Earth completely, then there was seemingly no hope of averting Instrumentality completely. Either she would be the one to initiate it, or SEELE would win and bring about their twisted version with them as the ones in charge. In which case, she could no longer waste time thinking about whether or not to continue with Commander Ikari's scenario. At least then, humanity would not be under the thumb of a group of megalomaniacs.
绫对布温维尼恩或地狱行政机构知之甚少，但她确信他们并未撒谎。若他们正筹备彻底撤离地球，那么完全阻止人类补完计划似乎已无可能。要么由她来启动，要么 SEELE 得逞，按照他们的扭曲理念，由他们掌控一切。在此情形下，她不能再犹豫是否继续执行碇司令的方案。至少那样，人类不会被一群自大狂所统治。

"Is everything alright, Miss Ayanami?" Bwynvienne asked concernedly.
"绫波小姐，一切都还好吗？" Bwynvienne 带着关切问道。

Rei blinked several times, realising her gaze had dropped to the ground, and returned her focus to Bwynvienne. "I am alright," she replied, "but may I ask a favour of you?"
蕾眨了眨眼，察觉到自己的视线已垂向地面，随即重新将目光投向布温维尼恩。“我挺好的，”她应道，“不过，能麻烦你帮个忙吗？”

Bwynvienne pushed herself off the shack wall and folded her arms. "I'm going to assume you mean a personal favour, since we've already established that no Administration business can take place now."
布温维耶恩从棚屋的墙上撑起身子，双臂抱在胸前。“我猜你是指个人帮忙，毕竟我们已经确认过，现在不能办理行政事务。”

"Yes. It is nothing major, I would just like you to carry a message for me."
是的。没什么大不了的，只是想请你帮我带个话。

A flaming eyebrow rose. "You believe that the embargo will eventually be lifted and I'll be allowed to return to actually deliver it. Well, I suppose I can at least try to carry your message. What is it?"
一道燃烧的眉毛挑起。“你认为禁运终将解除，我能够回去真正完成交付。行吧，我至少可以试试传递你的口信。是什么内容？”

Rei told her. Bwynvienne stood there, committing it all to memory, not once asking if she was sure. At the end, she approached Rei and gently laid a hand on her shoulder. Rei closed her eyes; when she opened them again, she could no longer detect the sensation Bwynvienne gave off. She walked back around the shack, and immediately noticed that Shinji and Asuka were still slowly making their way to the car.
蕾向她透露了信息。布温维尼站在一旁，默默记下所有细节，未曾质疑其真实性。结束时，她靠近蕾，温柔地把手搭在她的肩上。蕾闭目片刻，再次睁眼时，已无法感知布温维尼的气息。她绕回小屋后方，随即发现真嗣和明日香正缓缓走向车辆。

She caught up to them, but could not bring herself to look them in the eyes just yet. Despite all they had been through, she could not be sure how they would react to what was to come.
她虽然追上了他们，却还不敢直视他们的双眼。尽管共度了重重难关，她仍无法预料他们将如何应对接下来的局面。

All she could do was hope that they could forgive her for what she had to do.
她只能寄希望于他们能谅解她所必须采取的行动。

"What is the reason for the delays? We were supposed to begin the final phase tomorrow."
延误的原因是什么？我们原本计划明天进入最后阶段。

"We discovered critical manufacturing errors in some parts from the latest shipment from Russia. As a precaution we double-checked the parts from the previous shipment and found the same flaws. Now we have to wait for replacements."
我们在俄罗斯最新一批货物中的一些部件上发现了严重的制造缺陷。为确保安全，我们又检查了前一批货物的部件，同样发现了这些缺陷。目前只能等待更换部件。

"Hrm... make it quick. We cannot let something like equipment failure prevent us from achieving our ultimate goal. What is the current status of the Mass Production Series?"
嗯...抓紧时间。设备故障这类问题绝不能妨碍我们达成最终目标。大规模生产系列的现状如何？

"The final three are awaiting said parts, the rest have completed construction and testing."
最后三件所需的部件还在等待中，其余的已经完成建造并经过了测试。

"Inform us the moment those three are complete."
那三项任务一完成，请立即通知我们。

"Should we not attack now with what we have?"
我们现在不应该利用手头的资源发起攻击吗？

"There has been too much deviation from the original Scenario. Nothing can be left to chance. Ikari has obviously chosen to see what we do before beginning his own endgame, instead of proceeding immediately. Whatever he has planned clearly does not have a time limit."
原始场景的偏离已经过多，绝不能有任何侥幸心理。显然，碇源堂决定先观察我们的举动，再启动他的最终策略，而非立即行动。他所策划的内容显然不受时间限制。

"It doesn't matter what Ikari's plan is. He will fall, and the path to Complementation will finally be swept clean of obstructions. Instrumentality awaits."
碇源堂的计划如何并不重要。他必将失败，通往融合的道路将彻底清除障碍。人类补完计划正等待着。

One thing Shinji really didn't like about being confined to the Geofront was that he couldn't enjoy the food he ate. His condition meant that everything tasted the same to him unless Asuka was the cook. Unfortunately, she didn't have access to the kitchen.
真嗣对被困在 Geofront 最不满的是，他无法品尝到食物的美味。由于他的特殊情况，除非是明日香做的饭，否则他吃什么都感觉味道一样。遗憾的是，明日香没有厨房的使用权。

He was curious if food grown by Asuka would count, such as the watermelons, but unfortunately Bwynvienne was no longer around to ask. It would at least be something to experiment with at a later date... provided they made it through the coming attack.
他好奇明日香种的西瓜等食物是否也算在内，可惜 Bwynvienne 已不在，无法询问。这至少可以留待日后尝试...前提是他们能挺过即将来临的攻击。

"Trust me, Shinji, you're not really missing much," Asuka remarked as the three pilots picked at their meals. "This stuff isn't bad, but it's not going to win a Michelin star any time soon."
相信我，真嗣，你其实没错过什么，" 明日香边说边和另外两位驾驶员一起挑拣着食物。"这饭菜还可以，但离米其林星级还差得远呢。

"It is acceptable," said Rei.
雷说：'这是可以接受的。'

Asuka pointed her fork at her and nodded. "Acceptable. Exactly. It'll fill you up and that's what the staff here are going for. If you want fancy, go to that restaurant hanging from the top of the Geofront."
明日香用叉子指向对方，点头表示：“这样挺好。确实如此。这能让你吃饱，正是这里员工追求的。若想吃得更精致，不妨去那家悬挂在 Geofront 顶部的餐厅。”

Shinji glanced in the vague direction of the Geofront ceiling. He wanted to ask why the Geofront needed a city up there, but this was the same NERV that somehow moved a military ship several kilometres underground and into a lake. And now that he thought about it, wasn't there another one in Terminal Dogma where they had seen Lilith? Their decision-making process was strange.
真嗣朝第三新东京市地底都市的天花板方向瞥了一眼，心中疑惑为何上方还需建城。然而，这可是 NERV，那个曾将战舰移至地下数公里并沉入湖中的神秘组织。再一想，中央教条区不也有类似之处，他们在那里目睹了莉莉丝。NERV 的决策逻辑，实在让人捉摸不透。

When their meal was over, Asuka looked around at the cafeteria, empty of all but the pilots and the staff, and then stared hard at Rei. "Got a couple questions for you, Wondergirl," she said in a low voice.
用餐完毕，明日香环视四周，食堂里除了飞行员和工作人员外空无一人，她目光锐利地看向绫波丽，压低声音说：“奇迹少女，我有几个问题要问你。”

Rei held the stare for several seconds before nodding. "Ask, and I will answer what I can. With what the two of you now know there is little point in withholding information."
雷伊凝视片刻，随后点头道：“问吧，我会尽我所能回答。既然你们已知晓这些，再隐瞒信息已无必要。”

Shinji and Asuka's eyes flicked towards each other for a brief moment. "Okay. So." Asuka waved a hand for a moment, trying to get her words in the right order. "You are basically Lilith. The big giant alien in the basement."
碇真嗣与明日香的目光短暂相交。"行吧。那么。"明日香挥手示意，努力组织语言。"你其实就是莉莉丝，那个藏在地下室里的巨大外星生命体。"

Rei nodded. "This body contains her soul, yes."
丽点头确认：“是的，这个身体里寄宿着她的灵魂。”

"What about her memories?" asked Shinji. "Do you remember... wherever Lilith came from?"
关于她的记忆，你怎么看？" 真嗣追问。"你还记得莉莉丝的来历吗？

Somewhat uncertainly, Rei replied, "I cannot accurately answer that. I certainly have memories that are not my own, but her mind is simply too alien to comprehend. As if..." She faltered, seemingly unsure of an appropriate analogy.
略带迟疑地，Rei 回应说：“这个问题我无法给出确切答案。我确实拥有一些并非源自我的记忆，但她的心智太过异于常人，难以捉摸。就像是……”她顿了顿，似乎在斟酌恰当的比喻。

"It would be like trying to put a disk in a cassette player," Asuka offered. "Even if you could force it in there, the player just isn't built to read it."
这就像硬要把光盘塞进磁带机一样，"飞鸟解释说，"即便塞得进去，机器也根本无法识别。

As Rei nodded, Shinji had a brief thought about his SDAT, last seen somewhere in his bedroom, and realised it had been a while since he'd last used it. Just before the arrival of Arael, in fact. An event that felt like it had happened half a year ago at least. Not that it mattered anyway, since he couldn't return to the apartment to grab it.
绫波点头之际，真嗣脑海中闪过他的 SDAT 播放器，记得它还留在卧室的某个角落，意识到自己已许久未曾触碰。就在阿拉尔来袭前不久，那段记忆仿佛已是半年前的往事。然而，这已无关紧要，因为他无法返回公寓取回它。

"What else did you wish to know?" asked Rei, bringing him back to the present.
"你还想了解些什么？" Rei 问道，让他重新回到当前的情境。

Asuka tapped a finger against her chin, but it was Shinji who spoke. "Are you able to control that body on the cross?"
明日香用手指轻触下巴，然而是真嗣发问：“你能操控十字架上的那具身体吗？”

"No," said Rei, causing Asuka to slump slightly. "My control is limited to this body. It would require either my death, with my soul being allowed to return to Lilith, or I would have to physically merge with her."
不，"绫波说道，使得明日香略显沮丧。"我的控制仅限于此身。要么我死去，让灵魂回归莉莉丝，要么我必须与她进行实体融合。

"Which would kill you anyway, in a sense. Damn."
说到底，你终究难逃一死。真是的。

"Why do you ask?" 你为什么这么问？

"I was hoping you could use Lilith to help us against SEELE," said Asuka, sighing and leaning back in her seat. "If all the ominous crap we've heard is real, we'll need every advantage we can get."
我本希望你能利用莉莉丝来助我们对付 SEELE，"明日香叹息着，身体向后靠在椅子上。"若我们所闻那些不祥之兆属实，那我们得竭尽所能争取优势。

Rei was silent for a moment, and the look on her face was somewhat disconcerting. "Even if it were possible to wake Lilith, she would have no interest in helping. In fact, she would only make things worse."
瑞沉默片刻，脸上的神情颇让人不安。“即便真能唤醒莉莉丝，她也不会有助手的意愿。相反，她只会让局面更加恶化。”

"...Worse?" Shinji and Asuka both echoed. "Worse how?"
...更糟吗？" 碇真嗣和明日香同时问道。"怎么个糟法？

"Lilith must be kept dormant, or else she will initiate an Impact event," said Rei. "And that is not something we could convince her not to do. She would be compelled to do so, a biological imperative. It would be like asking a person to not breath or think." She gave the two of them a look. "You do have advantages already, though."
雷说道：'莉莉丝必须保持休眠，否则她将触发冲击事件。我们无法说服她放弃这一行为，这是她的生物本能所驱使的。这无异于要求一个人停止呼吸或思考。'她向两人投去一瞥，'尽管如此，你们已经具备了一些优势。'

"Sure, we have the synchronisation, but I don't have an AT-Field," Shinji countered. "Whatever's coming, we're going to need both our Evas to defend against it, and that means Asuka will have to constantly watch out for me."
确实，我们实现了同步，但我缺乏 AT 力场，" 碇真嗣回应道。"无论面对何种威胁，我们都需两台 Eva 共同防御，这就要求明日香必须时刻留意我的状况。

"Sure, we've been doing sim training in separate Evas for a little while now," Asuka added. "But simulations are no substitute for real combat."
没错，我们各自在 Eva 里进行模拟训练已经有一阵子了，"明日香接着说。"然而，模拟终究不能与实战相提并论。

"Hang on," said Shinji, suddenly recalling something. "What about the- what were they called? Mass something?"
等等，" 真嗣突然想起什么，说道，"那东西，它们叫什么来着？大规模的那个？

"The Mass Production Series Evas?" Asuka suggested. She then blinked several times in realisation. "Hey, yeah! What about- oh wait..."
是说大规模生产系列的 EVA 吗？" 明日香突然提议，随即眨了眨眼，恍然大悟。"对啊！那关于...哦，等等...

"Yeah, that's it," said Shinji. "Doctor Akagi mentioned them a while ago, but said they weren't going to be ready for a while."
对，就是这样，" 真嗣说道。"赤木博士之前提过，不过她说这些还得等一段时间才能就绪。

Asuka nodded pointedly. "Yeah, which means we're on our own for this." She suddenly stood up. "Come on, we really need to go get some simulator time in."
明日香肯定地点了点头。“没错，看来这事得我们自己解决了。”她猛地站起身。“走吧，我们得赶紧去模拟器上练练。”

"Huh? Oh, okay." Despite his confusion, Shinji wasted no time in getting out of his seat. The moment he was standing, Asuka put one of his arms around her shoulders and not-quite-dragged him out of the cafeteria without a word of protest. Perhaps their mothers would know something that could help them with the looming situation. At the very least, they could do some catching up, preferably without the mental nudging and winking whenever their fellow pilot came up in conversation.
"嗯？哦，好吧。"尽管一头雾水，真嗣还是迅速起身。他刚一站稳，明日香便将他的手臂搭在自己肩上，几乎是半拖半拽地将他带出了食堂，全程未发一言。或许他们的母亲能提供些许线索，助他们应对眼前的困境。至少，他们可以借此机会叙叙旧，尽量避免在提及同僚飞行员时，那种心照不宣的暗示和眼神交流。

Rei got up and followed them. Even though Shinji was still as blank to her sight as a wall, something about his relationship with Asuka made him... glow, when they were synchronised, as if Asuka was sharing a piece of her soul with Shinji.
绫波站起身，跟随在他们后面。尽管真嗣在她看来仍是一片空白，但每当他与明日香同步时，他们之间的某种联系让他仿佛被点亮，宛如明日香将自己的一部分灵魂分享给了真嗣。

A stark contrast from her own situation.
与她自己的境遇形成了鲜明的反差。

While they were on their way, Asuka got on the phone to Doctor Akagi and asked to use the simulators. Since she was busy with other things, she designated the bridge crew as overseers for the training and gave them permission to throw whatever they could at the pilots.
在前往途中，明日香给赤木博士打电话，请求使用模拟器。因博士忙于其他工作，她便让舰桥人员负责监督训练，并允许他们向飞行员们施加各种考验。

Shinji was already starting to get flashbacks to his training week of hell.
真嗣已经开始回想起那段如同地狱般的训练周的记忆。

"Thinly slice these, dicethat, and just cut the ends off those," said Hikari.
"把这些切成薄片，把那个切成小块，再把那些的末端去掉，"光说道。

"Yeah... I think I got it this time," said Toji.
"嗯...这次我觉得我搞懂了，" Toji 说道。

"Are you sure? I could repeat it a third time if you like."
你确定吗？如果需要，我可以再重复一遍。

"No no, I'll be fine!"
没事，我挺得住！

A knock at the door drew the couple's attention away from their work in the kitchen. A second later, Toji was shouting at Hisae not to run as she ran to answer the door, without even looking around. Despite his best efforts as well as Hikari's, his little sister was just far too happy to be able to move under her own power.
敲门声打断了这对夫妇在厨房的工作。紧接着，Toji 急忙喊住 Hisae，不让她跑，但她兴奋地跑去开门，连周围都没顾得上看。尽管 Toji 和妹妹 Hikari 极力阻止，Hisae 还是因为能自由行动而兴奋不已。

Feeling that Toji could finally be trusted with the task she gave him, Hikari headed for the front door as well.
意识到东治终于能够胜任她交代的任务，光也朝正门走去。

"Hi!" Hisae chirped. "Who're you?"
嗨！" 久枝兴奋地问道，"你是哪位？

"Hisae, that's not how you answer the door!" Hikari admonished, before noticing who it was that had knocked. "Oh hello... Natsumi Akera, right?"
Hisae，你应门的方式不对哦！" Hikari 提醒后，才看清敲门的人。"哦，你好... 是 Natsumi Akera 吧？

The black-haired girl nodded. "Hello Horaki. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I wasn't sure where else to turn."
黑发女孩点头道：“你好，洞木。希望我没打扰你，只是我不太确定还能找谁。”

Hikari's head tilted to the side. "What do you mean?"
光歪着头问道："你指的是什么？"

Akera looked somewhat nervous as she asked, "Do you happen to know where Kensuke Aida is staying? I wanted to speak to him about something."
阿克拉略显紧张地询问：“打扰一下，您知道新垣康佑的住处吗？我有事想和他商量。”

Hikari looked at her for a moment before turning to Hisae. "Please go help your brother in the kitchen."
光里看了她片刻，随即对久江说：“去厨房帮帮你哥哥吧。”

Hisae, either very perceptively or simply already bored, replied, "'Kay!" and, of course, ran off to the kitchen. Hikari stepped out into the hallway and pulled the door to behind her.
久江，或许是洞察力极强，又或许只是感到无聊，应了声：“好！”随即自然地跑向厨房。光走出房间，顺手将门带上。

"I already get the feeling I'm not going to like the answer," Akera remarked.
"我已经有预感，这个答案不会是我喜欢的，"阿克拉评论说。

"Sadly, you would be entirely correct," replied Hikari. "But... don't you already know about him being a pilot?"
遗憾的是，你说的没错，"光回应道。"不过……关于他是飞行员的事，你不是已经知道了吗？

"A what?" Akera blinked several times. "You mean like Ikari, Ayanami and that transfer student? Aida's one as well?"
什么？"阿凯拉眨了眨眼。"你是说像碇、绫波还有那个转学生？相田也是其中之一？

"Did he not mention it at all?" Hikari asked, puzzled.
"他一点都没提过吗？"光不解地问道。

"The only times we have spoken, it has been about his photography. That is why I have been looking for him, in fact. So you're telling me he's still in Tokyo-3?
我们仅有的几次交流，话题都是围绕他的摄影。其实，我一直在找他，也是因为这个。那么，你是说他还在东京-3 吗？

Hikari looked down, briefly fidgeting with a loose thread on her dress. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but there are two pieces of bad news regarding him. The first is that, yes, he's still in Tokyo-3. The second is..." She paused, and Akera immediately cut in.
光低头看着，手指轻轻摆弄着裙子上松脱的线头。“很遗憾，我得告诉你两个关于他的坏消息。首先，他确实还在第三新东京市。至于第二条……”她顿了顿，明立刻接过话头。

"Something happened to him, right?"
他是不是遇到什么事了？

"Y-yes, how did you know?"
对，你怎么知道呢？

"You wouldn't be hesitating if it wasn't something bad."
若非遇到坏事，你不会犹豫不决。

Hikari sighed heavily. She hated having to tell a lie, but the truth was just too grim. "The last we heard before leaving Tokyo-3 was that he'd been badly hurt somehow. Ever since then we haven't even been able to get in touch with Aida's father."
光沉重地叹了口气。她很讨厌说谎，但真相实在太过残酷。“我们离开东京-3 前最后一次听说，他不知何故受了重伤。自那以后，我们甚至无法与相田的父亲取得联系。”

"I see." Akera turned around. Without looking back, she added. "Thank you for your time, Horaki. Enjoy the rest of your day."
我明白了。" 亚克拉转身离开，未曾回头，她接着说："谢谢你，霍拉基，愿你今天剩下的时光愉快。

It may have been her imagination, but Hikari thought she heard a hitch in Akera's voice. She watched her leave, then headed back inside to come face to face with Hisae.
或许是她的错觉，但光似乎听出明良声音中有一丝迟疑。她目送明良离去，随后转身回到屋内，与久江不期而遇。

"She likes that boy," the girl said, suddenly looking serious.
女孩突然严肃地说：“她喜欢那个男孩。”

Hikari stared at Hisae for a moment. "Perhaps, but that's none of our business," she replied. "There's nothing that can be done about it anyway, since he's still in NERV's hospital."
光凝视着久世片刻，回应道：“或许如此，但这并非我们该操心的事。再说，他仍在 NERV 的医院中，我们也无能为力。”

Toji's voice rang out from the family room. "Uh, Hikari? About that... You gotta come see this."
透枝在客厅喊道：“喂，光，你得过来看看这个。”

The television's volume was turned up as they came into the family room, and the first thing Hikari noticed about the news bulletin was the familiar skyline of Tokyo-3.
他们进入客厅时，电视音量被调高，光一眼就认出了新闻快报中东京-3 那熟悉的天际线。

"-just received word that the head of NERV, Commander Gendo Ikari, is planning to use the Evangelions to create what is being called a Third Impact. The JGSDF, JASDF and JSSDF have been mobilised to assault NERV Headquarters and neutralise the threat by any means necessary."
-刚刚获悉，NERV 的领导人碇源堂司令正策划利用福音战士引发所谓的第三次冲击。日本陆上自卫队、航空自卫队及海上自卫队已紧急动员，准备对 NERV 总部发起攻击，并采取一切必要措施以消除此威胁。

"What the hell?!" Toji shouted. "The military's attackin' Tokyo-3?!"
搞什么鬼？！" 东治惊呼。"军队竟然在攻击东京-3？！

Hikari put a hand to her mouth in shock. "Our friends!"
光惊愕地捂住嘴巴：“我们的朋友们！”

"Are they gonna be okay, big bro?" Hisae asked, grasping Toji's arm.
"大哥，他们会没事吧？" Hisae 紧握着 Toji 的手臂，关切地问道。

"Of course they are, sis!" Toji put one hand over Hisae's, and his other hand gently ruffled her hair. "Those guys have taken down Angels. The military ain't got no chance in hell!"
当然啦，妹妹！" 东二一手搭在久世手上，另一只手轻柔地抚摸着她的头发。"那些人可是打败过天使的。军队根本没机会！

Around the world, numerous aircraft took to the skies from military bases as well as aircraft carriers. Fuel tankers flew ahead, some of them there merely to refuel other tankers before returning home. Most of the other aircraft were there for what any inquisitive people were told were 'training and surveillance units for experimental aircraft on test flights'. Their true goal was to escort the 'experimentals' as they headed out over the ocean. The escortees, none of them having ever so much as been mentioned in any experimental aircraft documents, began their long flight towards their target.
全球各地，众多飞机从军事基地和航空母舰腾空而起。燃料补给机率先起飞，部分仅负责为其他补给机加油后返回基地。其余大部分飞机，对外宣称是'用于训练和监视实验飞机试飞的单位'。实际上，它们的主要任务是护送这些'实验机型'穿越大洋。这些被护送的飞机，从未在任何实验飞机文件中露面，踏上了飞往目标的漫长旅程。

In Japan itself, dozens of armoured vehicles and hundreds of soldiers were deploying. Several of their own aircraft were also in the sky, but none of them seemed to show the slightest interest in the aircraft heading towards their country. Instead they, just like the incoming forces, were heading towards one specific point: Tokyo-3.
在日本境内，数十辆装甲车与数百名士兵正进行部署。尽管他们自己的几架飞机也在天空中，但对那些朝他们国家飞来的飞机却视若无睹。这些飞机和来犯的部队一样，目标明确——第三新东京市。

Ahead of both groups, other units were slipping through gaps in the city's sensor net; gaps that had been created by Angel attacks and left open due to budget cuts. The outposts that were still operating were infiltrated and neutralised to blind NERV to what was coming, the people stationed there brutally silenced.
在两组人马之前，其他单位正悄然穿过城市传感器网络的漏洞；这些漏洞因天使攻击而产生，又因预算削减而未被修复。仍在运作的哨所被渗透并被中和，使 NERV 对即将到来的威胁一无所知，驻守人员被残忍地灭口。

All this served only to delay the inevitable. The MAGI quickly put together that too many red flags were being raised and sounded the alarm. The few remaining outposts locked themselves down, and the invading force changed tactics to focus on the Geofront itself, which had also gone into lockdown.
这些举措仅是暂缓了不可避免的结局。MAGI 很快察觉到过多的危险信号，于是发出了警报。剩下的几个前哨站随即自我封锁，入侵者也改变战术，将目标锁定在同样已进入封锁状态的 Geofront 上。

Deep underground, Misato stared at the screens delivering updates on enemy activity and sighed.
在深深的地下，Misato 盯着屏幕上敌军活动的实时更新，不由得叹了口气。

"Looks like the final battle in the Angel War will be human against human."
似乎天使战争的终极对决将是人类之间的较量。
