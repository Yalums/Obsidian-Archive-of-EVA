Just a fluffy little Asuka/Shinji waff fic. And who wrote it? Really? This has to be a trick.  
只是一篇轻松的小甜饼，明日香和真嗣的同人文。谁写的？真的吗？这肯定是个恶作剧。

---
Today was the day. The day she finally crushed her opponent and claimed victory over its immovable arrogance.  
今天就是这一天。她终于要粉碎对手那不可动摇的傲慢，夺取胜利。

Asuka stared down the UFO catcher outside the video game arcade, gleaming in the afternoon sunlight. How much time and money had she sunk into this vile hell machine? How much of her pride had been squandered on its silently mocking façade?  
明日香盯着电玩城外的 UFO 抓娃娃机，它在午后的阳光下闪闪发光。她在这可恶的机器上投入了多少时间和金钱？她的自尊心又在它那无声嘲讽的外表下被消耗了多少？

Since she arrived in Tokyo-3 her schedule filled up faster than she anticipated. Between Eva tests, friends, keeping tabs on Mr. Kaji and suffering in that remedial school she was forced to attend her free time was less for recreation and more for recuperation.  
自从她来到第三新东京市，日程安排比她预想的还要紧凑。在 EVA 测试、朋友、监视加持先生以及被迫参加的补习学校之间，她的空闲时间越来越少，更多的是用于恢复精力而非娱乐。

But behind all of her other responsibilities was the hidden shame of her arrival in Japan: failing to win what she wanted, and then getting demeaned by Shinji and his idiot friends, and then being dragged into a street brawl with a pack of monkeys. The fight was a bother, the objectification was nauseating, but losing the doll she set her sights on was unforgivable.  
但在她所有的责任背后，隐藏着她来到日本的耻辱：未能赢得她想要的东西，随后被真嗣和他的那些白痴朋友羞辱，最后还被卷入一场与一群猴子的街头斗殴。打架是个麻烦，物化令人作呕，但失去她瞄准的那个玩偶是不可原谅的。

_Hello again, you bastard,_ Asuka thought, approaching the UFO catcher. _It's been a while, but today you will lose._  
又见面了，你这个混蛋，明日香心想，走向那个抓娃娃机。好久不见，但今天你一定会输。

She made a predatory circle around the machine, sweeping her eyes over the assortment of plushies sequestered behind its glass walls, searching out her prey. She paused and made another circle. Then one more. She clenched her fists.  
她在机器周围做了一个捕食者的环视，目光扫过玻璃墙后隔离开的各种毛绒玩具，寻找她的猎物。她停下，又绕了一圈。然后再一圈。她紧握双拳。

"… Damn it!" Asuka yelled, kicking the machine. "Where is it?"  
“…该死！”明日香大喊着，踢了机器一脚。“它在哪里？”

Several patrons around her decided on a hasty retreat. Asuka placed her hands on the glass, peering inside to locate her prize. She already claimed it; no one else was allowed to win it before her.  
周围的几个顾客决定迅速撤离。明日香将双手放在玻璃上，仔细寻找她的奖品。她已经赢得了它；在她之前，不允许任何人赢得它。

"Hey, you!" she shouted at the pale, skinny arcade clerk, who was doing his best not to notice the loud foreign girl abusing his UFO catcher. "When's the next shipment for this piece of crap coming in?"  
“嘿，你！”她对着那个苍白瘦弱的街机店员大喊，那人正尽力不去注意这个大声喧哗的外国女孩对他的抓娃娃机发泄不满。“这破玩意儿下一批货什么时候到？”

"U-Um, well, we don't usually order new supplies until we're running low on what we have, so—"  
"呃，嗯，我们通常是在库存快用完时才会订购新货，所以——"

Asuka was already back at the machine, shoving a coin into its slot. "Then I'll just win everything in here so you have to reorder. Which is ridiculous. I'm the customer. I'm always right."  
明日香已经回到了机器前，将一枚硬币塞入投币口。“那我就把这里的奖品全赢走，这样你们就不得不重新进货了。这太荒唐了。我是顾客，顾客永远是对的。”

She clutched the crane joystick, carefully lined it up with a grinning blue kitten, and smashed her fist on the release button. The claw plunged down and hooked the kitten around its neck, pulled it up, and neatly deposited it in the prize receptacle.  
她紧握着抓娃娃机的操纵杆，小心翼翼地对准了一只咧嘴笑的蓝色小猫，然后猛地一拳按下释放按钮。爪子迅速下降，勾住了小猫的脖子，将其提起，并准确无误地放入了奖品槽中。

"One down," Asuka muttered, tossing the doll into a nearby garbage can.  
“一个搞定，”明日香喃喃自语，将玩偶扔进了附近的垃圾桶。

Soon it was home to a menagerie of colorful animals. Asuka fed a steady stream of coins into the machine, keeping the crane in continual motion, selecting targets and sending them into her waiting clutches.  
很快，这里便成了五彩缤纷的动物园。明日香不断向机器里投入硬币，让抓钩持续运作，挑选目标并将其送入她等待的掌控之中。

She clinically examined her latest victory. "A lion doll with a coat and testicles. What is wrong with this country?" She added it to the collection in the trash can.  
她冷静地审视着自己的最新战利品。“一只穿着外套、长着睾丸的狮子玩偶。这个国家怎么了？”她将其加入垃圾桶里的收藏。

A small gathering of children had positioned themselves behind the tall foreign girl tossing prizes into the garbage. They cheered as she won again and threw a purple whale over her shoulder into their waiting hands.  
一群孩子聚集在那个高大的外国女孩身后，她正将奖品扔进垃圾桶。当她再次获胜并将一只紫色鲸鱼抛过肩头，落入他们伸出的手中时，孩子们欢呼起来。

"Get that one next," one boy said, pointing out a silver eagle.  
“接下来拿那个，”一个男孩指着一只银鹰说道。

"Shut up," Asuka said. “闭嘴，”明日香说。

The afternoon faded under the steady whir of the machine and the impressed applause of children. Asuka was just starting to worry about her increasingly light purse when the clerk edged up behind her. He looked pallid and nervous in the glass' reflection.  
午后时光在机器的持续嗡鸣和孩子们的赞叹掌声中渐渐流逝。明日香正开始担忧她越来越轻的钱包时，店员悄悄地走到了她身后。他在玻璃的倒影中显得苍白而紧张。

"Um, Miss?" he tried, holding up a tentative hand.  
“呃，小姐？”他试探性地举起一只手。

"What?" Asuka snapped, not bothering to look away from the mission.  
“什么？”明日香厉声回应，没有费心从任务上移开视线。

"Um, well, we're about to close, and—"  
"呃，我们快关门了，而且——"

"Already?" She glanced up at the late evening sky. "What kind of lame place closes this early?"  
"已经要关了？" 她抬头望向晚霞满天的夜空。"这么早关门，这地方也太没劲了吧？"

"It's store policy, so, ah—"  
"这是店里的规定，所以，啊——"

"God, fine. I swear, it's like no one wants me to be happy." She withered the clerk with a single glare as she stepped away from the game. The children around her groaned in disappointment and wandered away.  
"天啊，好吧。我发誓，好像没人希望我快乐似的。" 她用一个眼神就让店员蔫了，随即离开了游戏机。周围的孩子们失望地叹息，四散而去。

"We open tomorrow at eight, so—"  
"我们明天八点开门，所以——"

"As if I didn't know that!" Asuka interrupted. "And tomorrow's a school day! Are you advocating truancy to shore up your bottom line?"  
"好像我不知道似的！" 明日香打断道，"而且明天是上学日！你是提倡逃学来增加你的营业额吗？"

"O-Of course not!" the clerk said, waving thin arms in front of him. "You should definitely go to school!"  
"当然不是！" 店员挥动着细瘦的手臂在他面前。"你绝对应该去上学！"

"Oh, so now you don't want my business? I probably paid your entire month's salary today, you ingrate."  
"哦，现在你不想做我的生意了？我今天可能付了你整个月的薪水，你这个忘恩负义的家伙。"

The man was near tears. "I didn't mean that either. I just…" He took a breath and bowed. "Thank you for your patronage. Please return at your earliest convenience, Miss."  
那男人几乎要哭了。"我不是那个意思。我只是……"他深吸一口气，鞠了一躬。"感谢您的惠顾。请您方便时再来，小姐。"

Asuka issued a dismissive hum. "You really need to work on your customer relations." She looked over the remaining toys scattered around the garbage bin. "And clean this place up. It's a pigsty."  
明日香发出一声不屑的哼声。“你真的需要在客户关系上下点功夫。”她扫视着垃圾桶周围散落的玩具。“还有，把这里打扫干净。简直像个猪圈。”

She stalked off under the darkening sky, the streetlamps flickering to life as she moved. The shopping arcade's traffic was dying off as students and teens returned home for the night. Asuka weaved through them without conscious effort.  
她在渐暗的天空下快步离开，随着她的移动，街灯一一点亮。购物街的人流随着学生和青少年们回家而逐渐稀少。明日香无意识地穿梭其间。

_One more week,_ she told herself.  
再过一周，她对自己说。

Her hand flexed, remembering the crane's twitchy joystick, the worn release button, the mechanical whirs and clicks that became a mocking soundtrack to her endeavors. The dirty, reflective glass shield superimposing her strained, concentrated face with a rolling landscape of prizes she did not want.  
她的手微微弯曲，回想起那只鹤的跳跃操纵杆，磨损的释放按钮，以及那些机械的呼啸和咔嗒声，它们成了对她努力的嘲讽背景音乐。肮脏的反光玻璃罩将她紧张、专注的面孔与她不想要的奖品滚动景观叠加在一起。

Asuka frowned as faceless crowds parted around her and the night deepened above her.  
明日香皱起眉头，无脸的人群在她周围分开，夜色在她头顶加深。

One more week. 再过一周。

/\/\/\/\

"Rise! Bow! Dismissed!" "起立！敬礼！解散！"

Hikari concluded the day's classes. Asuka collapsed on her desk, bowing her head into her crossed arms under the weight of underserved suffering. The universe seemed to delight in thwarting her desires at every turn. Yet another ordeal appeared to test her ability and resolve. And financial liquidity.  
光结束了今天的课程。明日香瘫倒在桌子上，将头埋在交叉的双臂下，承受着不应有的痛苦。宇宙似乎乐于在每个转折点阻挠她的愿望。又一场考验似乎要测试她的能力和决心。还有财务流动性。

_I will beat that damn game,_ she thought. _I will claim what is mine._  
我一定会打败那该死的游戏，她心想。我要夺回属于我的东西。

"Asuka?" Hikari inquired, coming up beside her desk. "You okay?"  
“明日香？”光走到她桌旁问道，“你还好吗？”

Asuka grumbled something.  
明日香咕哝了一句。

"Cheer up! Um, you have a special day next week, you know."  
"振作点！呃，下周你有个特别的日子，知道吗？"

She propped her chin up with one hand. "Hmm. Oh, right. My birthday. Yippee."  
她用一只手托着下巴。"嗯。哦，对了。我的生日。耶。"

"Geez. You look so depressed. Oh! Do you hate your birthday, too? My sister Kodama always goes on and on every year about getting older and—"  
"天哪。你看起来这么沮丧。哦！你也不喜欢过生日吗？我姐姐小玉每年都会喋喋不休地说自己又老了一岁，还有——"

"It's not that. My birthday is nothing but a day people rightfully give tribute to me."  
"不是那样的。我的生日不过是人们理所当然向我致敬的日子。"

"Is it something else? You've been kind of glum for days."  
"是别的什么事吗？你这几天一直有点闷闷不乐。"

"Even my natural radiance can dim on occasion." Asuka sat back and crossed her arms. _I swore I'd beat that game by my birthday. I know it was an arbitrary deadline, but I never thought I'd fail._ She frowned. _I haven't failed. It's because of that dumb clerk and that dumb shop and that dumb machine. It's like the entire world is against me._  
"即使是我天生的光芒，偶尔也会黯淡。" 明日香向后靠，交叉双臂。我发誓要在生日之前通关那款游戏。我知道那是个随意的截止日期，但我从未想过自己会失败。她皱起眉头。我还没失败。都是因为那个愚蠢的店员、那家愚蠢的店和那台愚蠢的机器。仿佛整个世界都在与我作对。

Hikari gave her a smile of uncomfortable commiseration. "So, do you have any plans for your birthday?"  
光给了她一个尴尬的同情微笑。“那么，你生日有什么计划吗？”

She rose from her desk and started out of the class. "Misato was keen on me inviting people over for a lame party. Mostly because it saves her the trouble of making an actual effort. If this was stupid Shinji's birthday I bet she'd rent out NERV for him."  
她从桌子上站起来，开始走出教室。“美里一直催我邀请大家来参加一个无聊的派对。主要是因为这样她就不用费心准备什么了。如果这是愚蠢的真嗣的生日，我敢打赌她会为他租下 NERV。”

Hikari glanced behind her. "Oh, um, I forgot something I need to do for the teacher. I'll be right back. Uh, you can go on ahead. It'll only take a minute."  
光回头看了一眼。“哦，呃，我忘了有件事要帮老师做。我马上回来。呃，你可以先走。只需要一分钟。”

Asuka shrugged. "Whatever."  
明日香耸了耸肩。"随便。"

She left and took up a post by the door, leaning against the wall. Moral support, or at least an attentive grievance sponge, was less a luxury and more a necessity. Asuka couldn't complain like this to anyone else; Misato was emotionally incompetent, her time with Kaji was too important to weigh it down with negativity, and Shinji was nothing but a convenient outlet for the many frustrations in her life, including Shinji.  
她离开并站在门口，靠在墙上。精神支持，或至少是一个专注的抱怨对象，已不再是奢侈品，而是必需品。明日香无法向其他人这样抱怨；美里在情感上无能，她与加持的时间太宝贵，不能被负面情绪拖累，而真嗣不过是她生活中众多烦恼的一个便利出口，包括真嗣本人。

She reached into her satchel and weighed her purse by hand. She considered sneaking into Shinji's room again and helping herself to some of his funds. He certainly wasn't using his money for anything important. Just look at his wardrobe and personal possessions. The boy was as parsimonious as a monk and twice as dull.  
她伸手进书包，用手掂量了一下钱包。她考虑再次潜入真嗣的房间，拿走一些他的钱。他显然没有用这些钱做什么重要的事。看看他的衣橱和个人物品就知道了。这男孩节俭得像个僧侣，而且比僧侣还要无趣。

"Ikari." "碇。"

Asuka turned an idle ear towards the classroom. Hikari was addressing Shinji, her Class Rep voice at about half power, meaning she was politely ordering him to do something outside the scope of school.  
明日香漫不经心地听着教室里的动静。班长光正在对真嗣说话，她的班代表声音调到了一半，这意味着她在礼貌地命令他做一些超出学校范围的事情。

"… You do know Asuka's birthday is next week, right?" she was saying. "You do live with her and work with her."  
"……你知道下星期是明日香的生日吧？"她正说道。"你和她住在一起，还和她一起工作。"

"Poor bastard," Toji muttered in sympathy.  
"可怜的家伙，" 冬二同情地嘀咕道。

"Real unlucky," Kensuke grumbled.  
"真是倒霉，" 真嗣抱怨着。

"Yeah…" Shinji answered Hikari, ignoring his friends.  
"是啊…" 真嗣回答光，没理会他的朋友们。

"So you have to get her something really great for her birthday. You have no excuse not to. Now, I already have some ideas for you, so all you have to do is go get one, okay?"  
"所以你得给她准备一个超级棒的生日礼物。你没有任何借口不这么做。现在，我已经为你想到了一些主意，所以你只需要去选一个，好吗？"

"Actually, ah, I already got her something awhile ago."  
"实际上，啊，我之前已经给她准备好了。"

There was a moment of impressed silence from Hikari and disgusted quiet from his friends. Asuka fought down a gratified spark of surprise.  
光子那边传来了一阵赞赏的沉默，而他的朋友们则是一片厌恶的静默。明日香压抑住了一丝惊喜的火花。

"Well… well, that's great," Hikari said cautiously, but not without commendation. "I'm glad to hear it. Um, what did you get her?"  
"嗯…嗯，那太好了，"光小心翼翼地说，但并非没有赞赏之意。"我很高兴听到这个。呃，你给她买了什么？"

"Yeah," Toji demanded. "I'd like to know, too. What's up with you going out of your way this early for her? Or at all?"  
"是啊，"真嗣追问道。"我也想知道。你这么早为她费心，还是说你一直如此？"

"It's not a big deal," he answered, waving off any significance. "I mean, like Horaki said, I work with her and live with her, so I just wanted to be prepared."  
"没什么大不了的，"他回答，挥手表示这并不重要。"我是说，就像班长说的，我和她一起工作，也和她住在一起，所以我只是想提前准备好。"

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"Good work, Ikari." Hikari sounded genuinely pleased.  
"干得好，碇。" 光听起来真的很高兴。

"Should I get her something, too?" Kensuke wondered aloud.  
"我也该给她带点什么吗？" 健司自言自语道。

_Only if I want some kindling,_ Asuka thought. She took off down the hall to wait for Hikari and cover eavesdropping, trying not to wonder what Shinji got for her. _Good for him, being proactive for once. It better be something awesome._  
除非我想找点柴火，明日香心想。她沿着走廊跑去等待光，准备偷听，尽量不去想真嗣为她准备了什么。他这次倒是挺主动的，最好是个超棒的礼物。

She smiled as she walked. She forgot what she was so upset about before.  
她微笑着走着，忘记了之前为何如此烦恼。

/\/\/\/\

The crane jolted out of stasis, repositioning itself with expert precision. The claw plunged into the sea of dolls, flimsy metal prongs closing in around a bulbous head. The claw drew back, straining against the weight, then pulled free, triggering a seismic rearrangement of toys and animals. The award floated above the heap of shoddily made, poorly designed flotsam and dropped peacefully into the prize receptacle.  
那只机械爪从静止状态中猛然启动，以精准的专业手法重新定位。爪子猛地插入玩偶的海洋，脆弱的金属爪尖紧紧合拢，抓住了一个圆滚滚的脑袋。机械爪向后拉扯，承受着重量，随后挣脱开来，引发了一场玩具和动物的大规模重新排列。奖品悬浮在那一堆做工粗糙、设计拙劣的杂物之上，然后平静地落入了奖品收纳口。

Asuka reached in, felt the soft, squishy plush of triumph and withdrew the tiny smiling monkey doll. She hefted it in her hands, tossed it lightly, inspected its form. She tucked it under an arm, leaned forward against the UFO catcher and grinned.  
明日香伸手进去，感受到胜利的柔软绒毛，抽出了那只微笑的小猴子玩偶。她双手掂量着它，轻轻抛起，仔细检查其形状。她将它夹在腋下，身体前倾靠在抓娃娃机上，咧嘴笑了。

"_Suck it."_ “吃瘪去吧。”

She returned home with a bounce in her step.  
她带着轻快的步伐回到了家。

Shinji was in the kitchen, working on something for dinner that smelled like delight. She entered, humming to herself, dragging her feet.  
真嗣在厨房里忙碌着，准备晚餐的香味令人愉悦。她走进来，自顾自地哼着歌，拖着脚步。

"Hey," she said. “嘿，”她说。

"Hey," he said back. He didn't turn around, focused on the meal.  
"嘿，" 他回应道。他没有转身，专注于餐食。

Asuka frowned. She cleared her throat without need. "When are we eating?"  
明日香皱了皱眉。她不需要地清了清嗓子。"什么时候吃饭？"

"Uh, maybe in a half hour or so. Why? Do you need something?" He glanced at her and saw her swinging her school satchel on her arm. Tied to the strap was the monkey doll. "Where'd you get that?"  
"呃，大概半小时后吧。怎么了？你需要什么吗？" 他瞥了她一眼，看到她手臂上晃荡着学校书包。书包带上系着那个猴子玩偶。"你从哪儿弄来的那个？"

"Oh, this little thing?" Asuka sighed with practiced modesty. She shook her satchel to make the doll dance. "I just stopped by an arcade today and won it at a UFO catcher. No big deal." No need to let him know the many angry days or thousands of yen she spent to capture it.  
"哦，这个小东西？" 明日香带着惯有的谦虚叹了口气。她摇了摇挎包，让里面的玩偶跳起舞来。"我今天只是顺便去了趟游戏厅，在抓娃娃机上赢到的。没什么大不了的。" 没必要让他知道为此她经历了多少愤怒的日子，或是花了多少日元才抓到它。

"Oh." Shinji turned back to the counter. "I hate those games."  
"哦。" 真嗣转回柜台。"我讨厌那些游戏。"

"You would. They take skill."  
"你当然会讨厌。它们需要技巧。"

"… Couldn't you just buy something better in a real store?"  
“…你就不能在真正的店里买些更好的东西吗？”

Asuka sent him a flippant laugh. "Exactly what I'd expect you to say. I wouldn't expect you to understand."  
“正如我所料。”明日香轻蔑地笑了一声，“我可不指望你能理解。”

Shinji returned an irritated grunt. "If there isn't anything else, can I get back to work?" He sounded like cooking for her was the worst torture man ever devised. The Soryu Kitchen Inquisition.  
“如果没有别的事，我能回去工作了吗？”真嗣不耐烦地哼了一声，听起来为她做饭简直是人类发明的最残酷刑罚。“惣流厨房审判。”

"So sorry," she spat at him. "I hope you can somehow forgive me for daring to speak to you, Lord Ikari. I always forget how far beneath you I am."  
"非常抱歉，"她对他吐出这句话。"希望你能以某种方式原谅我竟敢与你交谈，碇大人。我总是忘记自己在你之下是多么卑微。"

"Look, I just… I want to finish this, alright? What is your problem?"  
"听着，我只是……我想完成这件事，好吗？你有什么问题？"

"You are." She walked out of the kitchen towards her room. "You and your amazing ability to spoil everything around you."  
"就是你。"她走出厨房，朝自己的房间走去。"你和你那惊人的破坏周围一切的能力。"

He didn't respond. 他没有回应。

Asuka slid her door shut as hard as Japanese construction allowed. She sat on her bed, eyeing the doll tied to her school satchel. She worked it free, holding it up before her. Empty bead eyes stared back.  
明日香用力地关上了门，力度之大，几乎达到了日本建筑的极限。她坐在床上，盯着绑在书包上的玩偶。她把它解开，举到面前。空洞的珠子眼睛回望着她。

She tossed the doll on the bed and lay down, turning away from it. It was just like Shinji to ruin a good mood.  
她把玩偶扔到床上，躺下，背对着它。真嗣总是有本事毁掉好心情。

"Stupid Shinji." "笨蛋真嗣。"

/\/\/\/\

It was Saturday after school. Asuka submitted to Misato's insistence on a party, trying to force a measure of social good cheer to sustain her school identity. Although she knew everyone invited, and expected their respect and admiration, socializing extensively with her peers always left her feeling less grown-up. Listening to them prattle on about boys and clothes and school and family was beneath her true interests and proved exhausting for any prolonged period of time.  
那是周六放学后。明日香在美里坚持要办派对的压力下，努力维持着学校身份所需的社交欢愉。尽管她认识所有被邀请的人，并期待他们的尊重和仰慕，但与同龄人广泛社交总让她觉得自己不够成熟。听他们喋喋不休地谈论男孩、衣服、学校和家庭，这些都与她真正的兴趣相去甚远，长时间下来令人疲惫不堪。

But appearances were paramount and keeping good relations with the commoners facilitated her school existence. As the only popular and attractive pilot it was up to her to maintain NERV's public image, too. Dour Shinji and the dreary First clearly were not up to the task, to say nothing of NERV's PR department. It was like none of them even cared.  
但外表至关重要，与平民保持良好关系有助于她在学校的生存。作为唯一受欢迎且迷人的驾驶员，维护 NERV 的公众形象也落在了她肩上。阴沉的 Shinji 和乏味的第一适格者显然无法胜任，更别提 NERV 的公关部门了。他们似乎都不在乎。

Misato was working late and Shinji opted for the relative sanctuary of Kensuke's house instead of weathering the storm of teenage girls soon to rage through the apartment, so Asuka had it to herself. That did not absolve Shinji of his domestic responsibilities, though.  
Misato 加班到很晚，Shinji 选择了相对安宁的 Kensuke 家避难，而不是忍受即将在公寓里肆虐的少女风暴，所以 Asuka 独自一人待在那里。但这并不意味着 Shinji 可以免除他的家务责任。

"The food's in the fridge, dishes are on the table," he told her, heading to the door. "If you need anything else I left the numbers of the takeout places on the counter. Have a good time."  
“食物在冰箱里，盘子在桌上，”他告诉她，朝门口走去。“如果你还需要别的什么，我把外卖店的号码留在柜台上了。祝你玩得开心。”

He sounded sulky and put out. Which was normal for him but today was Asuka's birthday and she refused to let his unlikable demeanor contaminate her celebration. It was like it killed him to be happy for anyone else. The preparations he cobbled together were half-hearted and he hadn't even wished her a happy birthday. She always had to drag him kicking and screaming into any basic encounter with real people.  
他的声音听起来闷闷不乐，很不情愿。这对他来说很正常，但今天是明日香的生日，她拒绝让他那不讨喜的态度破坏她的庆祝。对他来说，为别人感到高兴就像是要了他的命。他草草准备的那些东西都半心半意，甚至都没祝她生日快乐。每次她都得连拉带拽，才能让他勉强应付与真实人群的接触。

_I swear,_ she thought, _he'll only be happy when everyone else on earth is dead._  
她暗自咒骂，心想，只有地球上其他人都死光了，他才会真正开心。

Asuka trailed him to the door, clearing her throat as he slipped his shoes on. He ignored her. She pinched the back of his collar, holding him in place.  
明日香跟着他走到门口，在他穿鞋时清了清嗓子。他无视了她。她捏住他衣领的后部，让他停下。

He slumped. "What is it now?"  
他颓然坐下。“又怎么了？”

"Aren't you forgetting something?" He turned to stare blankly at her and she sighed. "My present? It is my birthday, genius. You _did_ remember to get me something, didn't you?"  
“你是不是忘了什么？”他转过头茫然地看着她，她叹了口气。“我的礼物呢？今天可是我的生日，天才。你总该记得给我准备点什么吧？”

"Oh." He shook out of private contemplation. "Oh, right. Yeah, I, uh, I did get you something." He reached into his pocket.  
“哦。”他从沉思中回过神来。“哦，对。是的，我，呃，我确实给你准备了点东西。”他伸手摸向口袋。

_Something that small?_ Asuka thought. _Maybe jewelry?_ She knew he had terrible taste but at least he was trying for a decent gift. And it was probably better than Kaji's absence and no gift.  
那么小的东西？明日香心想。或许是首饰？她知道他的品味糟糕透顶，但至少他在努力挑选一份像样的礼物。而且，总比加持的缺席和没有礼物要好。

Shinji took out his wallet and pulled out a few thousand yen. "Here you go."  
真嗣拿出钱包，抽出几张千日元纸币。“给你。”

She stared at his extended hand filled with crumpled bills. She searched his eyes to see if this was a joke.  
她盯着他伸出的手，里面塞满了皱巴巴的钞票。她凝视着他的眼睛，想确认这是否是个玩笑。

"This is a joke, right?"  
"这是个玩笑，对吧？"

"Um… no?" "呃…不是？"

"_This is a joke, right?"_  
"这是个玩笑，对吧？"

"What?" Shinji asked, getting red and angry. "You wanted your present and I gave it to you. Don't complain about it." He huffed. "It's the thought that counts."  
"什么？" 真嗣问道，脸红且生气。"你要礼物，我给了你。别抱怨。" 他哼了一声。"心意最重要。"

"What thought?" Asuka demanded. "You didn't get me anything and throw a wad of cash at me, like I can be bought off? What kind of girl do you think I am?"  
"什么心意？" 明日香质问。"你没给我任何东西，只扔了一叠钱给我，好像我能被收买似的？你把我当成什么女孩了？"

"A pretty ungrateful one. I _did_ give you a present. Happy birthday, jerk."  
"一个相当不知感恩的。我确实给了你礼物。生日快乐，混蛋。"

Asuka blushed in fury. She grabbed the money and threw it back in his face. The bills fluttered to the floor. Shinji shook in anger.  
明日香愤怒得脸颊通红。她抓起钱，狠狠地甩回他脸上。钞票飘落在地。真嗣气得发抖。

"Get out" she growled. "Just go. I don't want to look at you. Thanks for nothing, idiot."  
“滚出去”她咆哮道。“快走。我不想再看到你。什么忙也没帮上，白痴。”

"Fine!" Shinji exploded. "Don't expect anything from me next year!" He stormed out without looking back.  
“好啊！”真嗣爆发了。“明年别指望我再帮你什么！”他头也不回地冲了出去。

"Like I'd want anything from you!" she yelled after him.  
“谁稀罕你的东西！”她冲着他的背影吼道。

The front door hissed shut. Asuka spun on her heel and turned back to the kitchen. She saw the party supplies laid out carefully and had a sudden, vicious desire to sweep it all off the table. Shinji already ruined the party for her.  
前门嘶的一声关上了。明日香转过身，回到厨房。她看到精心摆放的派对用品，突然产生了一种强烈的冲动，想要把它们全部扫下桌子。真嗣已经毁了她的派对。

She looked down the front hall, and the rumpled gathering of money littering the floor. She turned away.  
她朝前厅望去，看到地上散落的一堆皱巴巴的钱。她转过身去。

"Idiot." "白痴。"

/\/\/\/\

Shinji's eyes flickered open.  
真嗣的眼睛微微睁开。

The light in his room was on. He sourly rubbed his eyes, wanting nothing but to go back to sleep. He got in late, making sure Asuka's party was over before returning home. She was barricaded in her room and he managed to slip into his own before alerting her. He hoped. She hadn't emerged when Misato got off work either and he figured he was safe to live until dawn.  
他房间的灯亮着。他苦涩地揉了揉眼睛，只想回到梦乡。他回来得很晚，确保明日香的派对结束后才回家。她把自己关在房间里，而他设法在她察觉之前溜进了自己的房间。他希望如此。直到美里下班，她也没有出来，他觉得自己可以安全地活到黎明。

He grabbed a handful of cover and turned towards the wall, too tired to turn the light off or wonder why it was on to begin with. He screwed his eyes shut.  
他抓起一把被子转向墙壁，太累了以至于不想关灯或思考为什么灯一开始就亮着。他紧紧闭上了眼睛。

"You're a heavier sleeper than I expected."  
“你比我想象中睡得更沉。”

Panic tore his eyelids open. Shinji's head spun and he found Asuka sitting on his desk, arms and legs crossed, glowering down at him like a disapproving god.  
恐慌撕裂了他的眼睑，迫使他睁开双眼。真嗣的脑袋一阵眩晕，发现明日香正坐在他的书桌上，双臂双腿交叉，像一位不满的神明般怒视着他。

"Get up," she ordered in a whisper. "We need to talk."  
“起来，”她低声命令道，“我们需要谈谈。”

Shinji stared at her. "Asuka!" He scrambled awake, pushing back against the wall and bringing his covers up for protection. "What are you doing in my room?"  
真嗣盯着她。“明日香！”他慌忙清醒过来，背靠墙壁，将被子拉起作为防御。“你在我房间里做什么？”

"Shut up!" she hissed at him. "Be quiet. I already told you: We need to talk. Now move it." He didn't move it and Asuka's face turned ill with a grimace. "Why are you hiding? You don't sleep in the buff, do you?"  
"闭嘴！"她低声对他吼道。"安静。我已经告诉过你：我们需要谈谈。现在动起来。"他没有动，明日香的脸因痛苦的表情而变得难看。"你为什么躲起来？你不会裸睡吧？"

"O-Of course not!" He pulled the covers back, displaying his loose T-shirt and shorts.  
"当然不是！"他拉回被子，露出宽松的 T 恤和短裤。

"You're presentable enough. I guess. Now get out of bed and march your behind to the living room. Like I said, _we need to talk._"  
"你还算体面。我想。现在起床，把你那屁股挪到客厅去。就像我说的，我们需要谈谈。"

Shinji realized this was yet another battle he would not win. He sighed and climbed out of bed. He could only imagine what she'd do to him if he had the audacity to invade her room while she was sleeping and demand a midnight audience. All he saw was blood and lost teeth and shattered limbs. He shivered as he left his room. Asuka loomed behind him, leading him to verbal execution on their cheap couch.  
真嗣意识到这又是一场他赢不了的战斗。他叹了口气，爬下床。他只能想象如果他有胆量在她睡觉时闯入她的房间，要求午夜会面，她会对他做什么。他眼前浮现出鲜血、断牙和碎肢的景象。他颤抖着离开了自己的房间。明日香在他身后逼近，将他引向那张廉价的沙发，准备进行一场言语上的处决。

"That's far enough," she told him. She swept past him and sat in the middle of the couch, sparing no room. She sized him up with a critical eye.  
“到此为止，”她对他说。她从他身边走过，坐在沙发中间，一点空间也没留。她用挑剔的目光打量着他。

"… You're not going to let me sit down?"  
“……你不让我坐下吗？”

"No." "不行。"

"And this can't wait until morning?"  
"这事不能等到早上吗？"

"_No._ Now, what do you have to say for yourself?"  
"不行。现在，你有什么要为自己辩解的？"

Shinji, too tired to be annoyed, slouched into the appropriate lack of self-worth to apologize for his inexcusable display of backbone that afternoon. He took a breath.  
真嗣累得连生气都提不起劲，只好颓然陷入那种应有的自我贬低中，为那天下午不可饶恕地展现出的骨气道歉。他深吸了一口气。

"I heard you the other day," Asuka impatiently cut him off. "When Hikari talked to you. You told her you already got me a present for my birthday. And yet today you hurl a few bills at me and call it a gift. So." She carefully uncrossed then recrossed her legs. "Either you lied to my best friend or you lied to me. Choose wisely."  
“前几天我听到了，”明日香不耐烦地打断他，“那天光跟你说话的时候。你告诉她已经给我准备好了生日礼物。可今天你却扔给我几张钞票就说是礼物。所以。”她小心翼翼地解开又重新交叉双腿。“要么你对我最好的朋友撒了谎，要么就是对我撒了谎。明智地选择吧。”

"Um…" He cleared his throat and worked hard at sounding nonchalant. "I didn't lie to either of you. Money can be a gift. It's the gift that keeps on giving."  
“呃……”他清了清嗓子，努力装作若无其事。“我对你们俩都没撒谎。钱也可以是礼物。这是那种持续给予的礼物。”

Asuka cracked her knuckles. Shinji wilted further. Fatigued dread triumphed.  
明日香扳了扳手指关节。真嗣更加萎靡不振。疲惫的恐惧占了上风。

"Alright," he exhaled in a puff. "I did get you something."  
"好吧，"他呼出一口气。"我确实给你带了点东西。"

"Well?" she demanded when he didn't move or speak. "Go get it!"  
"那然后呢？"她在他不动也不说话时质问道。"去拿过来！"

"… Fine. Hold on." "… 好吧。等一下。"

He disappeared into his room. She heard him rummaging in his closet. He came back holding a small wrapped box and shoved it at her, keeping his eyes from hers.  
他消失在自己的房间里。她听到他在衣橱里翻找的声音。他拿着一个小小的包装盒回来，塞给她时避开了她的目光。

"Here." "给。"

Asuka snatched it away, peering at him with disdainful gratitude. She tore the paper off, flinging the shredded remains beside her. She opened the box.  
明日香一把夺过，带着轻蔑的感激瞥了他一眼。她撕开包装纸，将碎屑甩到一旁。然后打开了盒子。

"Happy birthday," Shinji mumbled.  
“生日快乐。”真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka lifted the UFO catcher monkey doll from the box like it was a delicate flower. She looked up at him for an explanation.  
明日香从盒子里轻轻提起那只抓娃娃机里的猴子玩偶，仿佛它是一朵娇嫩的花。她抬头望向他，等待一个解释。

"That day we met you at the arcade, I saw you were trying to get that doll, so…" He blushed. He was still looking away. "I don't know. I thought you wanted it."  
"那天我们在游戏厅遇见你，我看到你在努力抓那个娃娃，所以……" 他脸红了。目光依旧避开。"我不知道。我以为你想要它。"

Between the glorious display of her underwear and the brutal thrashing she delivered to that gang of apes Asuka was surprised he remembered anything about that day clearly. A little detail like the doll should have been lost under the dazzling magnificence of meeting her. She hated the warm feeling that crept through her knowing he held on to such a memory.  
在她的内衣展示和她对那群猿猴般的混混的猛烈打击之间，明日香惊讶他还能清晰记得那天的事情。像娃娃这样的小细节本应被与她相遇的耀眼光辉所掩盖。她讨厌那种温暖的感觉，知道他保留着这样的记忆。

"I'm not going to thank you," she huffed. "I didn't need help winning it, obviously. I deserved to get it myself. I mean, do you have any clue how much money I blew clearing out that machine so they'd restock it?"  
"我不会感谢你的，"她气呼呼地说。"显然我不需要帮助就能赢到它。我理应自己得到它。我是说，你知道我花了多少钱才把那台机器清空，让他们重新补货吗？"

"You said it was no big deal that you won it!" Shinji shot back. "And like I didn't waste _my_ money and time? I hate UFO catchers!"  
"你说过赢这个没什么大不了的！" 真嗣反驳道。"难道我的钱和时间就没浪费吗？我讨厌抓娃娃机！"

"Only because you must be crappy at them!" She peered at him. "So why all the theatrics? Why didn't you just give it to me before?"  
"只是因为你肯定不擅长这个！" 她盯着他。"那干嘛这么大惊小怪？为什么不早点给我？"

"I…" He gestured helplessly to summon the right words. "I don't know. You looked really happy when you came home with the doll and I suddenly felt stupid for wasting so much time on something you already had and I thought you'd be upset with another one. Like, you'd think I got it just because I saw the one you had."  
"我…" 他无助地比划着，试图找到合适的词。"我不知道。你带着那个娃娃回家时看起来真的很开心，我突然觉得自己浪费那么多时间在一个你已经有的东西上很傻，我以为你会对再有一个感到不高兴。就像，你会觉得我得到它只是因为我看到了你有的那个。"

"You're an idiot." "你真是个傻瓜。"

"I know." He slumped. "Are we done? Or can I at least sleep a few more hours before you yell at me again?"  
"我知道。" 他颓然坐下。"我们结束了吗？还是我至少可以再睡几个小时，然后再被你吼醒？"

Asuka bit her tongue. He looked embarrassed and hurt. Something like pity gleefully tickled her and she hated it. Knowing Shinji actually selected a proper gift when everyone else, even Hikari, offered the expected store-bought trinkets and trivialities worked through a few layers of defense to sneak past the motivation to punish him fully. She gave up a sharp sigh.  
明日香咬了咬舌头。他看起来既尴尬又受伤。一种类似怜悯的情绪在她心中蠢蠢欲动，让她感到厌恶。知道真嗣竟然在大家，甚至是光子，都选择了那些商店里常见的廉价小玩意时，他却挑选了合适的礼物，这让她的一些防御机制开始松动，悄悄绕过了她原本想要彻底惩罚他的念头。她无奈地叹了口气。

"This doesn't let you off the hook for lying to me, you know," she told him, observing his weary face. "You are now indebted to me. You have to make me a special breakfast tomorrow morning. Not your usual boring fare. I want eggs. And bacon. And sausage. And waffles. And a fruit salad. If you manage to at least meet my expectations, I'll consider forgiving you."  
"这可不意味着你对我撒谎的事就一笔勾销了，你知道的，" 她对他说，观察着他疲惫的面容。"你现在欠我一个人情。明天早上你得给我做一顿特别的早餐。别拿你平时那些无聊的东西糊弄我。我要鸡蛋。还有培根。还有香肠。还有华夫饼。还有水果沙拉。如果你能至少达到我的期望，我会考虑原谅你。"

Shinji groaned. "I'll have to run to the mart before I begin."  
真嗣呻吟了一声。"我还得先跑一趟超市。"

"Good thing it's Sunday, then. You'll have a little extra time since I'll sleep in."  
"幸好今天是星期天，那你有额外的时间，因为我可以多睡一会儿。"

"Lucky me." He saw her readying a new strike on his self-esteem and cut in. "I'll do it. Okay?" Her eyes still glinted castigation. "I… I'm sorry. This is my fault and I'm an idiot. I'm sorry."  
"算我走运。" 他看到她准备再次攻击他的自尊，便抢先说道。"我会做的。好吗？" 她的眼神依旧闪烁着责备。"我……对不起。这是我的错，我是个傻瓜。对不起。"

She remembered how brusque he was when she showed him the doll she won, spoiling his little plan. He probably thought he was so clever getting it for her, and then lying about it. Such a headache over his insecurity. If he just had the guts to tell the truth in the beginning none of this would have had to occur. He wouldn't have to apologize and Asuka wouldn't have to think about forgiving him.  
她记得当他看到她展示赢得的玩偶时，他是多么的粗鲁，破坏了他小小的计划。他可能以为自己很聪明，为她弄到那个玩偶，然后还撒谎。这一切都是因为他内心的不安。如果他一开始就有勇气说实话，这一切都不会发生。他不必道歉，明日香也不必考虑是否原谅他。

"You still have to make me breakfast."  
"你还得给我做早餐。"

"I know." “我知道。”

He sounded tired but sincere. Drained and pitiful, but he was at least trying to take responsibility.  
他的声音听起来疲惫却真诚。筋疲力尽又可怜，但至少他试图承担责任。

Asuka forcibly uncrossed her arms and sighed out a degree of combative frustration. She looked away from him, scooting over and brushing the wrapping paper to the floor, opening up the couch.  
明日香强行放下交叉的双臂，叹了口气，带着几分好斗的挫败感。她移开视线，挪了挪位置，将包装纸扫到地上，展开了沙发。

"Room for one more?" she posed to him.  
"还能再挤一个吗？" 她向他问道。

Shinji stared at her like she just asked for a breakfast of grilled Pen Pen instead. He wasn't as tired anymore and felt himself nod slowly.  
真嗣盯着她，仿佛她刚刚要求早餐吃烤 Pen Pen 一样。他不再那么疲惫，感觉自己缓缓地点了点头。

"Sure." "当然。"

He sat. They stared ahead, side-by-side. Shinji drummed on his bare knees. Asuka idly made the monkey clap its hands. She mumbled something.  
他坐了下来。他们并肩而坐，目光直视前方。真嗣敲打着自己裸露的膝盖。明日香漫不经心地让猴子玩偶拍手。她喃喃自语着什么。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

"I said…" She sighed through her nose. "I said it might not be horrible having two of these." She turned the doll over in her hands. She still didn't look at him.  
“我说……”她鼻子里叹了口气。“我说，有两个这样的东西，或许不会那么糟糕。”她翻转着手中的玩偶。她依然没有看向他。

"Oh. Good. I'm glad." "哦，太好了。我很高兴。"

"I'm surprised you remembered I was trying to win this."  
"我没想到你还记得我在努力赢得这个。"

"It wasn't that long ago," he said.  
"那并不久远，" 他说。"

"I know that. But there were better things to look at."  
"我知道。但有更好看的东西。"

Shinji furrowed his brow and gazed at the ceiling for answers. Asuka sighed again.  
真嗣皱起眉头，凝视着天花板寻求答案。明日香再次叹了口气。

"So you really weren't looking like those other two," she muttered. She slouched, pushing her feet out. She held the doll on her stomach. "I don't like my birthday," she admitted in a small voice.  
"所以你真的不像那两个人那样看，"她低声嘟囔。她颓然坐下，伸直了双腿。她把玩偶放在肚子上。"我不喜欢我的生日，"她用细小的声音承认道。

"What? After all the fuss you made?"  
"什么？你之前闹得那么厉害？"

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

She sounded offended and he frowned.  
她的语气显得很受伤，他皱起了眉头。

They were silent. Shinji watched the doll tilt back and forth on her stomach.  
他们沉默着。真嗣看着那个娃娃在她肚子上前后摇摆。

"Why don't you like your birthday?" he asked quietly.  
“你为什么不喜欢你的生日？”他轻声问道。

She didn't answer for a time. "It's artificial," she finally told him. "People smile at me, and pay attention, and give me stuff but it isn't because I _did_ anything. It's like they think me surviving another year is a miracle that needs celebration. Like they're stunned I can take care of myself."  
她一时没有回答。“这是人为的，”她最终告诉他，“人们对我微笑，关注我，给我东西，但这不是因为我做了什么。他们好像认为我活过一年是个需要庆祝的奇迹。好像他们惊讶于我能照顾自己。”

Shinji watched the doll. "Should I not have… Ah, sorry for getting you something?"  
真嗣注视着那个玩偶。“我是不是不该……啊，对不起，给你买了这个？”

She hid the staid smile that tugged on her lips. "Idiot."  
她藏起了嘴角微微上扬的平静微笑。“傻瓜。”

"Sorry." “对不起。”

Asuka took a deep breath. "I wanted the doll because it was something I could get myself without anyone's help. It wouldn't be something someone gave to me." She gripped it in her hands, sliding her thumbs up to cover its eyes. "It's like piloting. Sure, someone else _made_ my Unit-02, but I'm its pilot because I worked hard and won it. It's an accomplishment no one can take from me. Don't you dare say this sounds silly."  
明日香深吸了一口气。“我想要那个玩偶，是因为我可以不靠任何人自己得到它。它不会是别人给我的东西。”她双手紧握着玩偶，用拇指滑上去遮住它的眼睛。“就像驾驶 EVA 一样。没错，虽然别人制造了我的二号机，但我能成为它的驾驶员是因为我努力争取来的。这是谁也夺不走的成就。你敢说这听起来很傻吗？”

"I won't." He weighed his thoughts. "So you're okay with me getting that doll for you?"  
“我不会。”他斟酌着言辞。“所以你接受我为你买那个玩偶吗？”

She laughed without noise. "Idiot. Don't you know you're supposed to spoil a girl sometimes?"  
她无声地笑了。“傻瓜。你不知道有时候应该宠宠女孩子吗？”

Shinji looked upset and confused.  
真嗣看起来既沮丧又困惑。

_Good. 很好。_

The apartment was silent. Outside, from the balcony window, the city lights hovered on night-black buildings beneath a shining full moon. They sat together in the dark.  
公寓里一片寂静。窗外，阳台外，城市的灯光在夜幕下的建筑上闪烁，一轮明亮的满月高悬。他们在黑暗中坐在一起。

"So," he asked, turning to her with a careful smile, "how was your birthday this year?"  
"那么，" 他转头向她，带着谨慎的微笑问道，"今年你的生日过得怎么样？"

She smiled back. It was easier than she anticipated.  
她回以微笑。这比她预想的要容易。

"Getting better." "越来越好了。"

/\/\/\/\

Misato stumbled out of her room, clipping her shoulder on the doorframe. She swore through a thick morass of morning breath and continued to the kitchen. The clatter of dishware from the room was a thunderous storm of knives and forks and pointy things pushing her back to the safe, quiet shelter of her bed.  
美里踉跄着走出房间，肩膀撞在门框上。她带着浓重的晨间口气咒骂着，继续向厨房走去。房间里餐具的碰撞声如同雷鸣般，是刀叉和尖锐物品的交响，将她推回那安全、宁静的床铺避难所。

_No,_ she thought. _There is beer in the kitchen. Hence, I must go there._  
不，她想。厨房里有啤酒。因此，我必须去那里。

The situation tactically assessed, she trudged forward into the kitchen. And abruptly came to a dead stop at the entrance.  
战术评估完毕，她拖着沉重的步伐走向厨房。却在入口处突然停住了脚步。

She stared at the surreal, slightly nightmarish scene. As expected, Shinji was posted at the stove, tending several sizzling pans, but beside him at the counter was Asuka wearing an apron, cutting fruit.  
她凝视着这超现实、略带噩梦色彩的场景。不出所料，真嗣站在炉子前，照料着几个滋滋作响的平底锅，但在他旁边的台面上，穿着围裙的明日香正在切水果。

Misato rubbed her eyes. She rapid-shutter blinked and refocused. Both of her wards were still in the kitchen working shoulder-to-shoulder on a meal together.  
美里揉了揉眼睛。她快速眨眼并重新聚焦。她的两个被监护人依然肩并肩在厨房里一起准备着饭菜。

"You know," Shinji was saying to her, "this is technically the birthday breakfast _you_ requested. You really shouldn't be helping."  
“你知道，”真嗣对她说，“这严格来说是你要的生日早餐。你真的不应该帮忙。”

Asuka scoffed. "Like I'd trust you to get it right without my supervision. This isn't your usual remedial soup and stir-fry, Third."  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“像我会放心让你在没有我监督的情况下做对似的。这可不是你平常的简单汤和炒菜，三号。”

His voice was still dry, but lacked its familiar, subtly passive-aggressive annoyance. Her words were sharp but her tone was absent of any real malice. They were both smiling. Misato rubbed her eyes again.  
他的声音依旧干涩，但少了那熟悉的、隐约的被动攻击性恼怒。她的话虽尖锐，语气却并无真正的恶意。两人都在微笑。美里再次揉了揉眼睛。

"I do have cookbooks. And I do have some experience. I'm not a helpless babe in the kitchen."  
"我确实有烹饪书。而且我也有一些经验。我在厨房里可不是个无助的婴儿。"

"Please. Any competence is relative. And I want this to my exact specifications. Otherwise you'd just ruin what was left of my birthday."  
"拜托。任何能力都是相对的。我希望这完全符合我的要求。否则你只会毁了我剩下的生日。"

They both still smiled. 他们俩仍然微笑着。

They worked in silence and Misato watched them from the entrance of the kitchen, feeling an unprepared warm swell of pride. She wished she didn't have a hangover.  
他们默默地工作着，美里从厨房入口处注视着他们，心中涌起一股未曾预料的温暖自豪感。她真希望自己没有宿醉。

Asuka finished cutting the fruit and took a quick peek at Shinji. He was absorbed with the stove. She turned away.  
明日香切完了水果，迅速瞥了一眼真嗣。他正全神贯注于炉灶。她转过身去。

"Thanks," she said softly without looking at him.  
“谢谢，”她轻声说道，没有看向他。

He turned to her, puzzled. "I thought you said you weren't going to say thanks."  
他转向她，面露困惑。“我以为你说过不打算说谢谢的。”

Asuka smiled to herself. 明日香暗自微笑。

"Idiot." “傻瓜。”

End 结束

Author notes: The alternate title for this was _When Tsuns Collide!_  
作者注：本文的另一个标题是“当刺猬相遇时！”

Welcome to amateur hour! Admittedly, this is _far_ from the best thing I've ever written, but it was an unrelenting brain worm burrowing through my head for months. I had to get it out. So, anyways. That's it. Just a little, predictable, fluffy attempt at my dirty, secret vice: Waff. Well, that's almost it.  
欢迎来到业余时间！诚然，这远非我写过的最佳之作，但它就像一只顽固的脑虫，在我脑海中钻了数月。我必须把它写出来。总之，就是这样。只是我那肮脏、秘密的癖好——Waff——的一次小小、可预见、轻松的尝试。嗯，差不多就是这样。

OMAKE of Darkness… Because that's what you expect from me, right?  
黑暗番外……因为这就是你们对我的期待，对吧？

Shinji's eyes flickered open.  
真嗣的眼睛微微睁开。

He was on the ground, his face pressed against cool tile. His vision slowly defogged and he found himself in the kitchen.  
他躺在地上，脸紧贴着冰凉的瓷砖。视线逐渐清晰，发现自己身处厨房。

He groaned. Every part of him felt heavy and immense. He tried to sit up and failed. He tried to prop himself up on his arms and after three attempts discovered them bound securely behind his back. The slug his tongue transformed into refused to let him speak.  
他呻吟了一声。全身沉重无比，尝试坐起却失败了。他用双臂支撑自己，经过三次尝试才发现双手被牢牢绑在背后。舌头变得像条懒惰的虫子，拒绝让他开口说话。

Something unnatural caught the periphery of his vision and he struggled to pitch his head up, earning a severe wave of dizziness for the effort. Sunspots danced before his eyes.  
视野边缘捕捉到某种不自然的东西，他努力抬起头，却因此感到一阵强烈的眩晕。眼前闪烁着太阳的光斑。

His vision cleared and Shinji tried to cry out in horror. Misato lay sprawled on the kitchen floor, her neck slashed open. Deep red blood was splashed over the tile. Her lifeless eyes stared back at him.  
他的视线逐渐清晰，真嗣试图惊恐地呼喊。美里四肢摊开躺在厨房地板上，脖子被割开，深红色的血液溅在瓷砖上。她那无神的眼睛回望着他。

He panicked. He looked wildly around the room, ignoring how his head swam. Something unnatural caught his distorted attention and he focused, waiting for his sight to coalesce. Three nooses swung in a row from the ceiling.  
他惊慌失措。他疯狂地环顾四周，无视自己头晕目眩的感觉。某种不自然的东西吸引了他的扭曲注意力，他集中精神，等待视线凝聚。三条绞索从天花板上并排悬挂着。

A pair of bare feet entered his vision. He recognized the sparkly red toenail polish.  
一双赤脚进入他的视线。他认出了那闪亮的红色脚趾甲油。

"Asuka?" he slurred. He strained to look up. She was towering above him, wearing nothing but a flowing hospital gown.  
"明日香？" 他含糊不清地说道。他努力抬头望去，她正高高地站在他面前，只穿着一件飘逸的病号服。

"Yes, she's right here," Asuka said, showing off the monkey doll he won from the UFO catcher. "Say hi, Asuka." She held the doll over her mouth and spoke in a higher voice. "Hi, Shinji. Thank you for rescuing me." She lowered it from her face. "Oh, how sweet! I think she likes you, Shinji."  
"是的，她就在这儿，" 明日香说着，炫耀着他在 UFO 抓娃娃机上赢得的猴子玩偶。"打个招呼，明日香。" 她把玩偶举到嘴边，用更高的声音说："嗨，真嗣。谢谢你救了我。" 她将玩偶从脸上移开。"哦，真可爱！我觉得她喜欢你，真嗣。"

"I don't like stupid Shinji!" the doll voice squeaked.  
"我才不喜欢笨蛋真嗣！" 玩偶的声音尖声说道。

"Now, now. Don't be rude. It's okay to like him. You don't have to lie about it and be mean to him so no one finds out. How ridiculous."  
"好了，好了。别这么粗鲁。喜欢他是可以的。你不必为了不让别人发现而撒谎并对他刻薄。这太荒谬了。"

Asuka twirled on her heel, holding the doll by the hands. "Little Asuka is so happy to be free now. I knew I had to rescue her. Every day she kept calling to me for help. I thought I was the only one who could save her, since I was the only one who could hear her. But I was mistaken." She glanced over her shoulder. "It was terribly sweet of you to save her for me. I know Asuka truly appreciates it."  
明日香转过身来，双手握着玩偶。"小明日香现在自由了，真是太高兴了。我知道我必须救她。每天她都在呼唤我求救。我以为只有我能听到她的声音，只有我能救她。但我错了。"她回头瞥了一眼。"你救了她真是太好了。我知道明日香真心感激你。"

Shinji limply struggled against his ropes.  
真嗣无力地挣扎着，试图挣脱绳索。

"D-Don't say that!" doll Asuka said. "I told you I don't like him or anything!"  
"别这么说！" 玩偶明日香说道。"我告诉过你，我不喜欢他，一点儿也不！"

"_Shut your mouth!"_ Asuka screamed at the doll, bringing it a hair from her snarling mouth. She breathed raggedly for a moment then recovered. "Asuka appreciates it, because now her greatest, bestest wish can finally be granted. She gets to die with her mama! She couldn't die by herself, oh no," she explained. "That would be _crazy._" Her face twitched at the word, then recovered with a brilliant smile. "It would be too lonely. She needs company."  
"闭嘴！" 明日香对着玩偶尖叫，几乎要将它从她咆哮的嘴边扯下来。她喘息了一会儿，然后恢复了平静。"明日香感激这一点，因为现在她最大的、最美好的愿望终于可以实现了。她能和妈妈一起死去！她不能独自死去，哦不，"她解释道。"那太疯狂了。"她说到这个词时，脸抽搐了一下，随即又恢复了灿烂的笑容。"那太孤单了。她需要陪伴。"

She hopped up on a chair and grabbed one of the free nooses. She strung it around the doll's neck. It hung in the air, smiling obliviously.  
她跳上椅子，抓起一根空闲的绳索。她将它套在玩偶的脖子上。它悬挂在空中，无知无觉地微笑着。

"Now just hold on, Asuka dear," she said, beaming at her handiwork. "Mama will be with you in a moment." She dropped to the floor, slipping a bit on the blood.  
"现在先别急，亲爱的明日香，" 她笑着看着自己的杰作。"妈妈马上就来陪你。" 她跌坐在地板上，脚下滑了一下，沾到了血迹。

"Ms. Misato," Shinji whimpered. Tears trickled down his face.  
"美里小姐，" 真嗣呜咽着。泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落。

"Yeah," Asuka said breezily, wiping her foot on a clean section of tile. "She came home early and found me with the rope, and you all tied up and knocked unconscious… Boy, what a sight _that_ must have been!"  
"是啊，" 明日香轻松地说，用脚在一块干净的瓷砖上蹭了蹭。"她提前回家，发现我拿着绳子，你们都被绑着，还被打晕了……哇，那场面一定很惊人！

She hauled him up to his feet and nearly lost him. His legs felt like warm rubber. She guided him past the blood to the chair, one arm around his waist, the other holding his chest as she balanced his sluggish body against her side.  
她用力将他拉起身，差点又让他滑倒。他的双腿软绵绵的，像温暖的橡胶。她搀扶着他绕过血迹，走向椅子，一只手臂环在他的腰间，另一只手托着他的胸膛，将他迟缓的身体靠在自己身侧。

"I think I can see why she might like you," Asuka told him quietly, peeking down to find his eyes. "You _are_ terribly cute. And you even smell good. Oh, I was so glad she was thinking about settling down with a nice boy like you."  
“我想我能明白她为什么会喜欢你，”明日香轻声对他说，低头寻找他的目光。“你真是太可爱了。而且你闻起来也很香。哦，她考虑和你这样的好男孩安定下来，我真是太高兴了。”

Shinji watched numbly as Asuka dragged him to the chair, sat him down on it, then climbed up to pull him to his feet beside her.  
真嗣麻木地看着明日香将他拽到椅子旁，让他坐下，然后爬上椅子，拉他起身站在她身边。

"Oh, God," he whispered. "哦，天哪，"他低声说道。

"You don't have to cry," she told him, tenderly wiping his cheeks dry with her palms. "This is a happy day!"  
"你不必哭，"她温柔地告诉他，用掌心轻轻拭去他脸颊上的泪水。"今天是快乐的日子！"

"Asuka, s-stop," he slurred.  
"明日香，别，别这样，"他含糊不清地说道。

"She can't hear you right now, remember?" She nodded to the hanging doll. "But you'll be able to talk to her soon." Asuka struggled to position him on the chair. "Whew! You're a bit heavier than you look."  
"她现在听不到你说话，记得吗？" 她朝悬挂的玩偶点了点头。"但你很快就能和她交谈了。" 明日香费力地将他安置在椅子上。"呼！你比看起来要重一些。"

She let him fall against her, reaching around him to find the second noose. She pulled it over his head and down to his neck gently, almost lovingly. A quick tug made it garrote-tight and she hopped off the chair. Shinji struggled on his tiptoes to keep from choking. Asuka tested her foot against the chair, judging how hard to kick.  
她让他靠在自己身上，伸手摸索着找到第二个绳套。她温柔地将它套过他的头，拉到脖子上，几乎带着爱意。轻轻一拉，绳套紧得如同绞索，她随即跳下椅子。真嗣踮着脚尖挣扎，以免窒息。明日香用脚试探着椅子，判断该用多大的力踢开。

"Pl-Please," he managed to cough out.  
"请……请……" 他勉强咳出声来。

"Room for one more, Shinji."  
"还能再坐一个，真嗣。"

She stared into his eyes and smiled as she took the chair from under him with a sweep of her foot.  
她凝视着他的眼睛，微笑着用脚一扫，将椅子从他身下抽走。

[Jho](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/51577/Jho): Hmm I liked the story, but I think the relations at the end was the part I enjoyed most. Asuka was almost too cruel and I cant see Shinji ever turowing a wad of bills as a backup gift in frustration. That omake was very dark, it should come with a warning disclaimer 0_0
嗯，我喜欢这个故事，但我觉得结尾的关系是我最喜欢的部分。明日香几乎太残忍了，我看不到真嗣会沮丧地拿出一叠钞票作为备用礼物。这个 omake 非常黑暗，应该加上警告免责声明 0_0

[Cotillon](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4022449/Cotillon): I was like whoo, you gave Shinji some self-esteem... Asuka wasn't as horrid as in your other works. I loved the hell out of it but something was strange, missing... *reads omake* ohhh, now I remember why I love you ;3
我当时想，哇，你给了真嗣一些自尊...... 明日香不像你其他作品那么可怕 我爱死它了，但有些东西很奇怪，缺失了...... *看了番外* 哦，现在我想起来我为什么喜欢你了;3

[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C): The story was well told, and pretty predictable as most waff is. I liked it, but it wasn't terribly memorable (well... I guess memorable is probably the wrong word seeing as I read it like five minutes ago). I think it suffers more from lots of waff stories revolving around a gift that one character gives to another, than any actual short comings in the story. So as you yourself said, not your best work, but a short enjoyable little piece.As for the omake... Well it was never an official competition, but I think you've won the "Most Disturbing Asuka in Fan Fiction" award. Congratulations.
故事讲得很好，但和大多数虚构故事一样很容易预测。我喜欢这个故事，但它并不是非常令人难忘（嗯...... 我想 “难忘 ”这个词可能用错了，因为我五分钟前才读完）。我认为它更多的是围绕一个人物送给另一个人物的礼物而展开的华而不实的故事，而不是故事中的任何实际缺点。因此，正如你自己所说，这不是你最好的作品，但也是一部令人愉快的小短篇。虽然不是正式比赛，但我认为你赢得了 “最令人不安的明日香同人小说 ”奖。祝贺你

'I swear, she thought, he'll only be happy when everyone else on earth is dead.' LITTLE DO YOU KNOW, WOMAN.  
她暗自起誓，心想：“只有地球上其他人都死光了，他才会真正开心。”你可真是无知，女人。

Ahem. 咳咳。

And little does Shinji know, that mused late night invasion of her room may end in blood and broken-off-at-the-gum-line teeth, but it may end in the smoothest Barry White. Ooooooh, baby.  
而真嗣并不知晓，那个深夜潜入她房间的念头，可能会以血和断至牙龈的牙齿告终，但也可能迎来最顺滑的 Barry White。哦哦哦，宝贝。

But seriously, against all good judgment and my usual dislike for Waff...pretty damned palatable. As you lamented before, sure, you can see it coming, but hey, people still like romcoms as long as they're well-made. That's the key, my friend. This is pretty well-made.  
但说真的，尽管违背了所有良好的判断和我对华夫饼的通常厌恶...相当可口。正如你之前哀叹的，当然，你可以预见到，但嘿，只要制作精良，人们仍然喜欢浪漫喜剧。这是关键，我的朋友。这部作品制作得相当不错。

Favorite scene hands down in the bedroom meeting. It's incredibly naturalistic and speaks a lot of any teenaged encounter and the old odd intimacies that can erupt between two people, especially at that age. Reminds me of such times. I like that. Despite Asuka's ego, she realizes it, too.  
最喜欢的场景无疑是卧室里的相遇。它极其自然主义，充分表达了任何青少年相遇的情景以及在那个年纪两个人之间可能爆发的古怪亲密感。让我想起了那样的时光。我喜欢这一点。尽管明日香有她的自尊，她也意识到了这一点。

Speaking of, let's talk your Asuka. And you were worried. She's snippy, at times bitchy, and all together the early series Asuka we all know and love (well, some of us without the major psychotic hatreds of her). Even if you still want to shake some sense into her at times. But eh, she's a teenager. I think that's the proper response: she's a teenager. We all know her past, but here as in the opening scenes of the series, she's just a kid. And that's an important distinction to make. Cheers.  
说到这个，我们来聊聊你的明日香。你之前还担心来着。她有时尖刻，偶尔刻薄，完全就是早期系列中我们熟知并喜爱的那个明日香（当然，那些对她怀有严重精神憎恨的人除外）。即便有时你仍想让她清醒些。但话说回来，她是个青少年。我觉得这反应很正常：她是个青少年。我们都知道她的过去，但在这里，就像系列开篇的场景一样，她只是个孩子。这一点很重要，需要明确。干杯。

And I still want to clock Shinji for the apologies, but he's got some of that manga bite. Good times.  
我还是想因为那些道歉揍真嗣一顿，但他确实有那种漫画里的狠劲。挺有意思的。

And then...THE WAFF CAME. My thoughts: Sudden pathos...oh no! It's coming! Drums in the deep! It's com- And all was smote under the ruin of 'Getting better.' Emergency D'AWWWWW release.  
然后...甜蜜温馨的情节来了。我的想法：突如其来的悲情...哦不！要来了！深渊中的鼓声！它来势汹汹- 结果全被‘正在好转’的废墟淹没了。紧急释放超萌能量。

It's solid WAFF, take heart indulging yourself every now and again. We all know what a shameless softie you are under it all. :P  
这是纯正的温馨甜蜜（WAFF），偶尔放纵一下自己吧。我们都知道你骨子里是个无耻的软心肠。:P

And that omake, I detect a little Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Now there's a crossover. Heh.  
还有那个番外，我察觉到了一丝《龙纹身的女孩》的影子。现在这可是个跨界组合。嘿。
