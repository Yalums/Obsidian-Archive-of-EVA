Just another love story of a guy and a girl.  
只是又一个男孩和女孩的爱情故事。

---
"If you're going to confess, back off."  
"如果你要表白，就退后。"

I am unsure where my courage came from, but once upon a monday afternoon, during our class' lunch break, an 17 year-old average boy stood in front of one of the popular girls in school. And that average boy happened to be, well.. me, I guess. Yeah, yeah it was me.  
我不确定我的勇气从何而来，但在一个周一的午后，我们班午休时，一个 17 岁的普通男孩站在了学校里一位受欢迎的女生面前。而那个普通男孩，嗯，我想就是我。没错，就是我。

"I'm..." "我……"

"Didn't I tell you? I'm not interested, save your voice. And saliva."  
"我不是告诉过你吗？我没兴趣，省省你的声音和口水吧。"

She is beautiful... and complex. That sums it up, at least for me, at least from what i've observed. Her physical beauty could be simplified by the words, what you see is what you get. The latter was what i'm definitely most concerned, for some reasons, my curiosity wanted to peek inside that complexity.  
她美丽...且复杂。至少对我来说，这就是她的全部，至少从我观察到的来看。她的外在美可以用‘所见即所得’来概括。而后者，正是我最为关注的，出于某些原因，我的好奇心驱使我想一探那复杂之处的究竟。

"N-n-no! I'm not here to do that."  
“不-不-不是的！我不是为此而来的。”

"Then, what do you need from me?"  
“那么，你需要我做什么？”

Now, now.. How am I going to tell her I want to know her without sounding way too creepy?  
现在，现在...我该怎么告诉她我想了解她，又不显得太过诡异呢？

WAIT. 等等。

I wanted to know her. I'm interested in her personality. I'm attracted to her eeriness. If I say things like, can I taste your apple pie? Isn't that confessing! Guess not, that was more maniac. But. But. No! Waaaa! Hurry. Think!  
我想了解她。我对她的性格感兴趣。我被她的神秘感吸引。如果我说，我能尝尝你的苹果派吗？那不就是在表白吗！猜错了，那更像是个疯子。但是。但是。不！哇啊啊！快点。想想！

"Uhmm..." "嗯..."

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

She's impatiently playing with her hair, twisting few strands around her slender fingers.  
她不耐烦地摆弄着自己的头发，纤细的手指绕着几缕发丝打转。

"Do you like guro manga?"  
"你喜欢猎奇漫画吗？"

There's a long pause. 沉默了许久。

I know I said something odd.  
我知道我说了些奇怪的话。

Man! What an awful thing to ask a girl!  
天哪！问女孩子这种问题真是糟糕透顶！

My whole body was statued in place, I began to tense up, I feel sooo cold.  
我的整个身体仿佛被定住了，我开始紧张起来，感觉好冷。

My lips were twitching like crazy, I was trying my very best to laugh it off, walk away, forget this ever happened, and never to talk to her again... But I couldn't even force a small grin!  
我的嘴唇疯狂地抽搐，我尽力想用笑来掩饰，走开，忘记这一切，再也不和她说话……但我连一丝微笑都挤不出来！

Setting my thoughts aside, I began to take more notice of her reaction. The moment I realized I blurted some stupid question, I was totally expecting her to stab me with every curse she knows. And, in every possible language if that'll satisfy her. She could slap me, too! With two hands! In unison! Her feet may join in, as well.  
我暂时搁置了思绪，开始更加留意她的反应。当我意识到自己脱口而出一个愚蠢的问题时，我完全预料到她会用她所知道的所有诅咒来攻击我。而且，如果这能让她满意的话，甚至可以用各种语言。她还可以用双手扇我耳光！同时进行！她的双脚也可能加入进来。

Nothing of that sort happened.  
但这一切都没有发生。

Wait, wait. 等等，等等。

Is this a new way of taking revenge? As what they say, silence kills.  
这是新的复仇方式吗？正如他们所说，沉默是致命的。

Those eyes, the way they stare back at mine, they were probably talking right now, "You insensitive, son off the beach!"  
那些眼睛，它们这样回望着我，可能正在说，“你这个没心没肺的，海边生的儿子！”

Then my gaze travelled down to her nose, what a small, cute nose.  
然后我的目光落在了她的鼻子上，多么小巧可爱的鼻子。

To her lips, so red and it parted. Sheet! She's going to say some-  
她的唇如此红润，微微张开。天哪！她要说话了——

*Bell rings.* *铃声响起。*

A vintage saying but whatever, "Saved by the bell!"  
一句老话，但无所谓，“铃声救场！”

Hmm, did I just say it out loud?  
嗯，我刚才是不是说出来了？

I mouthed sorry not once, not twice, definitely not thrice but I think I chanted it while I bowed before her.  
我嘴上说着对不起，不是一次，不是两次，绝对不是三次，但我想我在她面前鞠躬时一直在念叨这个词。

All eyes were fixed on me even as I take my seat, still chanting the word sorry.  
当我坐下时，所有的目光都集中在我身上，我仍然在念叨着对不起。

"Yo, Shinji! What was that you're doing talking to her? Never thought you got a huge crush on that new girl."  
"哟，真嗣！你刚才跟她聊什么呢？没想到你对那个新来的女生这么着迷。"

"I just asked her something."  
"我只是问了她点事儿。"

Nosy as ever, my childhood friend, Touji Suzuhara. He is a member of the school's varsity, not bright, let's be honest, but totally lively, down to earth and fun.  
一如既往地爱管闲事，我的青梅竹马，铃原东治。他是学校田径队的成员，说实话，不算聪明，但绝对活泼、实在又好玩。

"Meh. Liar. She is hot, no doubt you fancy her."  
"哼，骗子。她很火辣，你肯定对她有意思。"

"You, too? I told you, I came up to her and asked, nothing more."  
"你也这么想？我跟你说过，我只是上去跟她搭话，没别的。"

Another childhood friend of mine, Kensuke Aida. The founder of the Filmmakers Club, he loves to vlog a lot, anytime, anywhere. He's not as cheerful like Touji but he is witty.  
我儿时的朋友，相田剑介。电影制作社的创始人，他非常喜欢随时随地拍视频博客。他不像东治那么开朗，但很机智。

We all share different interests but we are best of friends. How the heck did it happen, who knows. Life is pretty tricky, after all.  
我们各有不同的兴趣，却是最要好的朋友。究竟是怎么回事，谁知道呢。毕竟，生活总是错综复杂。

Any further discussions were cut, the professor entered the room, same old routine as the second half of my day takes place.  
任何进一步的讨论都被打断了，教授走进了房间，一如往常，我的下午就这样开始了。

I wanted to completely erase our previous encounter, but I could feel her fixed stare at my back. her eyes were assumably speaking again, "Someone's going to make you spend your every day a living hell, freak-o."  
我想要彻底抹去我们之前的相遇，但我能感觉到她紧盯着我背后的目光。她的眼神想必又在说话了，“有人会让你每天都活在地狱里，怪胎。”

Of course she wouldn't let me off the hook just like that.  
她当然不会就这样轻易放过我。

The day ended, nothing else happened. I caught a glimpse of her empty seat. She would always leave class right away, and today was no difference. I wanted to inwardly rejoice but I felt disappointed. I don't exactly know why, but I am.  
那天结束了，再无其他事情发生。我瞥见了她空荡的座位。她总是立刻离开教室，今天也不例外。我本想暗自庆幸，却感到失望。我不太明白为何如此，但确实如此。

I was late, walking slowly, peacefully, in the middle of the street filled with cherry blossom petals. There's no need to rush, run like there's no tomorrow. I did it on purpose, anyway. Hah! Yes! I'm a lowlife! I did this to avoid her, so what. Tch.  
我迟到了，慢悠悠地走在满是樱花瓣的街道中央。没必要急匆匆，像没有明天一样奔跑。反正我是有意为之。哈！没错！我就是个无赖！我这么做就是为了避开她，那又怎样。切。

"HEY!" “嘿！”

That voice! 那个声音！

You must be kidding me.  
你一定是在开玩笑吧。

"Wait up!" "等等！"

I pretended I didn't hear her and walked a bit faster than my previous pace.  
我假装没听见她的话，加快了脚步，比之前的步伐更快了一些。

A hand grabbed my left shoulder, strong, firm. How on earth did she catch up. I halted, body bumped against my back, I felt something sof-  
一只手紧紧抓住了我的左肩，力道坚定。她究竟是怎么追上来的。我停下脚步，身体被猛地撞上后背，我感觉到某种柔软——

"Whoa. Suddenly stopping like that. Are you okay? Are you by chance ignoring me?"  
哇哦，突然这样停下来。你还好吗？你该不会是在无视我吧？

Im certain it was her, its the same voice but at the same time, it felt quite different.  
我确信那是她，声音是一样的，但同时，感觉又相当不同。

Recurrently, I stood still, wasn't able to flex a single muscle. Meanwhile, she walked past me and for the second time, we're face to face. It was undoubltedly her. This was planned. She's waiting for me!  
我反复地僵立在原地，连一根肌肉都无法动弹。与此同时，她从我身边走过，这是我们第二次面对面。毫无疑问是她。这是计划好的。她在等我！

"Hi. I know you're already aware of who I am but I believe we're not properly introduced. My first day in class was crappy, actually my mondays are always crappy. Tuesdays are okay, sometimes great, other times not really. Rei Ayanami, by the way. You are?"  
“嗨。我知道你已经知道我是谁了，但我想我们还没有正式介绍过。我上课的第一天糟透了，实际上我的周一总是很糟糕。周二还好，有时候很棒，有时候就不怎么样。我是绫波零，你呢？”

Is this a trap? 这是陷阱吗？

Was what I wanted to ask her, and was rude than the question I asked her yesterday, so no. Of course I didn't say it out loud. In the smallest part of my brain, I was thinking why she's completely different from yesterday.  
我本想问她这个，但比昨天的问题更无礼，所以当然，我没有大声说出来。在我大脑最微小的角落里，我在想为什么她和昨天完全不同。

With a sweet smile planted on her angelic face, she's extending her arms, offering her right hand. To shake or not to? Might as well take it, even if at the back of my mind I was creating scenarios such as blades hiding inside her palms. That'll frigging hurt, dude. And if I don't shake hands with her, she might shove the blades inside my mouth! That's possible man, she knows I love guro!  
她天使般的脸上挂着甜美的微笑，伸出手臂，伸出右手。握手还是不握？不妨接受，即使在我脑海深处，我正在设想她手掌中藏有刀片的情景。那会很疼的，伙计。如果我不和她握手，她可能会把刀片塞进我嘴里！这是有可能的，她知道我喜欢血腥暴力！

We shook hands. 我们握了握手。

Dayum. 天哪。

It hurts! 好痛！

IT HURTS! 好痛啊！

ITS THE SOFTEST HAND I EVER TOUCHED THAT IT HURTS!  
这是我所触碰过的最柔软的手，却也痛彻心扉！

How could I doubted her genuine kindness.  
我怎会怀疑她那真挚的善意。

"S-Shinji. Shinji Ikari."  
“真-真嗣。碇真嗣。”

I completely misunderstood her. She's kind, and sweet, and beautiful, and really beautiful, and extremely beautiful. She is not the ice princess, she is the shining, shimmering, summer sunshine.  
我完全误解了她。她善良、甜美、美丽，真的非常美丽，极其美丽。她不是冰公主，她是闪耀的、绚烂的夏日阳光。

"Uhm.. Ikari-san... About yesterday..."  
“呃... 碇同学... 关于昨天的事...”

I was gleefully building a small sand castle but then the ocean took it away. Its fun while it lasted.  
我正兴高采烈地堆着小沙堡，结果大海把它带走了。虽然短暂，但乐趣无穷。

"Waaa! Sorry! I'm really sorry Ayanami! I didn't mean to sound rude or anything."  
"哇！对不起！我真的对不起绫波！我不是有意要显得无礼的。"

"My, my.. Ikari-san. Stand up, please. You don't have to do that. Your uniform is going to get dirty."  
"哎呀呀.. 碇同学。请站起来，不必如此。你的制服会弄脏的。"

I was bowing, down, flat to the ground, almost kissing it, literally.  
我正深深鞠躬，几乎贴到地面，简直像要亲吻它一样，字面意思。

"I swear. It wasn't to make fun of you or to-"  
"我发誓。我不是为了取笑你或者——"

An attractive lady like her would never tolerate that kind of behavior! I was out of the line, shame on you Shinji! Shame on you! Really, guro manga? Guro manga!  
像她这样迷人的女士绝不会容忍那种行为！我越界了，真丢脸，真嗣！真丢脸！真的，血腥漫画？血腥漫画！

"I like it. I like guro manga."  
"我喜欢。我喜欢血腥漫画。"

Of course she likes guro manga!  
她当然喜欢猎奇漫画！

HUH? 啊？

Holy broccoli. 天哪，西兰花。

"What? What was that?" “什么？刚才是什么？”

"First, stand. Come, i'll help you up."  
“首先，站起来。来，我扶你起来。”

She did. I started building my sand castle once more, my dazzling sand castle.  
她确实做了。我又开始建造我的沙堡，我那耀眼的沙堡。

"Did I heard it right? Do you? Hmmmmm... Are you suuuuuure?"  
“我听对了吗？你真的吗？嗯……你确定吗？”

"Haha! Ikari-san is so funny. Yes I am! Don't play dumb. How did you know I like guro manga?"  
“哈哈！碇同学真有趣。是的，我确实喜欢！别装傻了。你怎么知道我喜欢猎奇漫画？”

Jackpot. 大获全胜。

Faster than preparing an instant ramen, who would've thought that careless, stupid mistake will bear fruits. We share the same interest, this is exciting.  
比泡一碗方便面还快，谁能想到那个粗心大意的愚蠢错误竟会开花结果。我们有着共同的兴趣，这真是令人兴奋。

"I... don't really know. I happened to like guro manga and was engrossed in reading the other night, it kinda sticked to me, and then I asked you that. I'm... happy. We are very much alike."  
"我...真的不太清楚。我碰巧喜欢上了猎奇漫画，有天晚上沉迷其中，那种感觉就留在了心里，然后我就问了你那个问题。我...很开心。我们真的很相似。"

She blushed a faint pink, soooo cute! She softly smiled, way waaay sweeter than strawberry shortcakes and gelato with a cherry on top.  
她的脸颊泛起淡淡的粉红色，真是太可爱了！她温柔地微笑着，比草莓蛋糕和顶着樱桃的意式冰淇淋还要甜美得多。

"You don't find it... bizarre? A girl reading guro."  
"你不觉得...这很奇怪吗？一个女孩看猎奇漫画。"

"I love guro. Bizarre for me is... attractive."  
"我喜欢猎奇。对我来说，猎奇是...吸引人的。"

"Haha! Thanks Ikari-san. I never expected anything like this. I mean.. to make friends. I'm happy, too. Ahhh... Well... We're super late, do you want to spend a guro day with another guro freak?"  
"哈哈！谢谢碇先生。我从没想过会有这样的事。我是说...交朋友。我也很高兴。啊...好吧...我们超级晚了，你想和另一个猎奇爱好者一起度过一个猎奇日吗？"

Oh. 哦。

My. 我的。

Lungs. 肺。

I can't breathe. Did she? Did she! She did! She asked me!  
我无法呼吸。她问了吗？她问了！她真的问了！她问我了！

I nodded. Of course that's given, who wouldn't?  
我点头。当然，这是理所当然的，谁会不答应呢？

With our backs facing the way to our school, I was thinking I was about to spend the best Tuesday of my life. Screw you school, screw the boring professor and his bland class. Hahaha! I'm spending the day with one of the hottest girls in the campus. I don't know why she flipped, or maybe she's naturally snobby when it comes to boys? And girls. As far as I could remember, during the first day of class, some of our classmates tried to approach her and she showered them with death glares and curses. I was absent so I didn't witness how awful it was.  
我们背对着学校的方向，我心想这即将成为我一生中最棒的星期二。去你的学校，去你的无聊教授和他那乏味的课堂。哈哈哈！我今天要和校园里最火辣的女孩一起度过。我不知道她为什么突然转变，或者她对男生——以及女生——本来就很傲慢？据我所知，开学第一天，有些同学试图接近她，结果她用死亡凝视和咒骂回应他们。我那天缺席了，所以没亲眼见到那场面有多糟糕。

We took the train, shut ourselves inside our own little universe, we just don't give a sheet while people shot us with their weird and disgusted looks. We chatted about loose limbs, rotten flesh like we're eating the tastiest meatballs, ever. Yeah, that's how delicious our convo was. Throughout the time, people hearing us seemed sick to their stomach, little Shinji was thrilled and well-entertained, as if a child watching Sesame Street and Spongebob. And the rest of the day was a free trip to Disneyland. Awesome day is awesome!  
我们乘上了火车，把自己关进了一个小小的宇宙，对旁人怪异和厌恶的目光毫不在意。我们聊着松散的肢体、腐烂的肉，就像在品尝最美味的肉丸一样。没错，我们的对话就是这么美味。整个过程中，听到我们谈话的人似乎都感到恶心，而小真嗣却兴奋且乐在其中，仿佛一个孩子在看《芝麻街》和《海绵宝宝》。而剩下的时间就像是一场免费的迪士尼之旅。真是太棒了！

"Good morning Ayanami-san!"  
"早上好，绫波同学！"

"Morning." "早。"

And that was it. 就这样。

Mothercooking. 妈的。

A single word and she walked off. Nooooooo! A well-spent lottery win I won't forget my entire life.  
就一个词，她转身走了。不！那次彩票中奖花得真值，我这辈子都不会忘记。

My 101% positive attitude took a 360 degree turn. She is someone complicated, a huge labyrinth brought to life. When you thought you're about to reach the end, you're actually lost, and that sucks.  
我那 101%的积极态度来了个 360 度大转弯。她是个复杂的人，一个活生生的巨大迷宫。当你以为快要到达终点时，其实你已经迷失了，这真糟糕。

"I saw that Ikari-kun. You two are close?"  
"我看到了，碇君。你们俩关系很好吧？"

Gimme a break. Why do they make such actions a big deal. People are hungry for issues. By the way, it was Hikari Horaki, Touji's unofficial sweetheart (lol) and our class representative.  
饶了我吧。为什么他们把这种行为看得那么重。人们就是爱找话题。对了，那是光子堀木，东治的非官方甜心（笑），也是我们班的班长。

"We're not." “我们没有。”

I put my shoes in the shoebox and disappeared from the sight of a stunned Hikari.  
我把鞋子放进鞋盒，从目瞪口呆的光的视线中消失了。

I feel down. Ayanami made me uneasy, anxious, then cheerful, ecstatic and right now... gloomy as ever, happy all saints day to me.  
我感觉很低落。绫波让我不安，焦虑，然后又让我高兴，欣喜若狂，而现在...一如既往地阴郁，万圣节快乐，我对自己说。

First class and I'd like to call it a day. I was bursting with sparkling happiness last night, I didn't want to sleep. Now that my high spirit's gone, I feel garbage. I would occasionally steal glances at the back, 2 rows away, that's her seat, she's looking straight ahead, eyes fixed at the board. Who is this girl. Is there an alien invasion at their house? Yesterday was such a blast. Grrrrr. Gimme back my tuesday Ayanami, wednesday Ayanami is... empty.  
第一节课刚上，我就想结束这一天。昨晚我满心欢喜，兴奋得不想入睡。现在精神消退，感觉糟透了。我会偶尔偷瞄后方，隔着两排，那是她的座位，她正直视前方，目光紧盯着黑板。这个女孩是谁。她家是不是有外星人入侵？昨天真是太开心了。呃呃呃。把我的周二绫波还给我，周三的绫波……空空如也。

*Sigh* *叹气*

"I don't feel well, can I go to the infirmary?"  
“我不舒服，可以去医务室吗？”

"Is that so. You may excuse yourself Ikari."  
"原来如此。你可以退下了，碇。"

"Thank you." "谢谢。"

I bowed and made my leave. Not my day, indeed not my day.  
我鞠躬告辞，确实不是我的日子，真的不是我的日子。

I arrived at the infirmary, no occupants, great, no school doctor, awesome. Now, off to dreamland.  
我来到了医务室，空无一人，太好了，没有校医，棒极了。现在，去梦乡吧。

*After an hour* *一小时后*

I opened my eyes and Ayanami was there.  
我睁开眼睛，绫波就在那里。

"Hi Ayanami." “嗨，绫波。”

"Hi." "嗨。"

"Geez! What are you doing here?"  
"天哪！你在这里做什么？"

There are no tricks, no illusions, I don't do drugs, I often hallucinate but not today. She's most likely the real deal.  
这里没有花招，没有幻象，我不吸毒，我经常产生幻觉但今天没有。她很可能是真的。

"Looking after you. Are you sick?"  
"照顾你。你生病了吗？"

"No. Just lack of sleep, don't tell the teacher. His lessons are far worse than sleeping pills,."  
"没有。只是缺觉，别告诉老师。他的课比安眠药还管用。"

Nah, she didn't smile. The entire time, she remained composed, straight-faced, very doll-like.  
不，她没笑。全程她都保持着镇定，面无表情，像个精致的玩偶。

*After several minutes* *几分钟之后*

"You could go back to class Ayanami. I'm not sick anyways."  
"你可以回绫波班了。反正我也没生病。"

"Its okay. Classes are boreshows."  
"没关系。上课都是无聊透顶的。"

A lot of questions were battling inside my screwed head. I wanted this, I should be able to handle this well. But she's way too complicated. The questions were giving their best shots, fighting with all they got, but they lost, all of them. I couldn't ask her. I'm in no position to question her behavior, we're not in that stage, not yet.  
许多问题在我混乱的脑海中激烈交战。我想要这个，我应该能处理好。但她实在太复杂了。这些问题竭尽全力，奋力一搏，但最终都败下阵来。我无法问她。我没有资格质疑她的行为，我们还没到那个阶段，至少现在还没有。

"I know how astonished you are. I'm going to explain everything tomorrow. Hopefully I could."  
"我知道你有多惊讶。我明天会解释一切。希望我能做到。"

"Okay." "好吧。"

The only word I could come up with. Its as if yesterday didn't exist, my mind's buffering, its an on and off internet connection. Given the chance to travel back in the past, back last Monday, I know I will still do the exact same thing. Mind-boggling, yes yet no regrets. And later, i've yet to experience sleep deprivation like never before... for the second time.  
我能想到的唯一词。仿佛昨天不复存在，我的思绪在缓冲，就像时断时续的网络连接。如果有机会回到过去，回到上周一，我知道我仍会做同样的事。令人困惑，是的，但没有遗憾。而后来，我还将体验前所未有的睡眠不足……第二次。

We spend the rest of the day in the infirmary... in peace, quiet... tranquility.  
我们余下的时间在医务室度过……宁静，平和……安宁。

A new day unfolds. I've created every possible scenarios that might take place later when revelation time comes up. The professor joined in, Ayanami's not yet here.  
新的一天展开。我设想了所有可能发生的情景，当揭晓时刻到来时。教授也加入了，绫波还未到。

"Due to high fever.." 由于高烧……

No. It can't be. 不，不可能。

DON'T SAY IT. 别说了。

"Ayanami is.." 绫波她……

My silent pleas are of no use.  
我无声的祈求毫无用处。

"..absent for today. Attendance check. Akito."  
"..今日缺席。点名，秋人。"

That woman. She is doing things on purpose.  
那个女人，她绝对是故意的。

She sure loves to make me go psycho!  
她就是喜欢让我抓狂！

*After classes* *下课后*

*A man standing in front of Ayanami's apartment*  
*一个男人站在绫波的公寓前*

*Doorbell* *门铃响了*

"WAAAIIIIIITTT!" "等等！"

*Door opens* *门开了*

"Who is- Motherbaker." "谁是——天哪。"

"Caught you! I knew it!"  
"抓到你了！我就知道！"

You can't fool me. She isn't sick at all! She's strong enough to play tug-of-war, Ayanami's apartment door special edition. She was a bit hesitant yesterday so I was kind of certain this'll happen. Yep, one of my worse case scenario predictions.  
你骗不了我。她根本没病！她力气大到可以玩拔河，绫波的公寓门特别版。她昨天有点犹豫，所以我大概猜到会发生这种事。没错，这是我最糟糕的预测之一。

"Fact! Ikari! Let go! What are you thinking barging in someone's home!"  
"事实！碇！放手！你怎么能随便闯进别人家里！"

"Avoiding me much? You don't have to confess what you wanted to confess if you don't feel like it. Not that much of a big deal anyways."  
"这么躲着我？不想说就别说了，反正也不是什么大不了的事。"

"Shut it, moron! Then what are you doing here if you're not bothered!"  
"闭嘴，白痴！既然你不介意，那你在这里干什么！"

"Man, the attitudes getting a lot complicated and-"  
"伙计，这态度变得越来越复杂了，而且——"

"Whaaat! Irritating? Nerve-wrecking? Hate on me, go on! I don't give a fridge!"  
"什么！烦人？让人崩溃？尽管讨厌我吧，继续！我根本不在乎！"

"I don't accept fridge either. Got one, i'm more than satisfied."  
我也不接受冰箱。有一个就足够满意了。

Our little game went on for who knows how long. I don't want to use all my strength and hurt her you know, with these muscles... my pride and joy. HAH! And, she's stronger than expected.  
我们的这个小游戏不知持续了多久。你知道，我不想用尽全力伤到她，毕竟这些肌肉可是我的骄傲和快乐源泉。哈哈！而且，她比预想的要强得多。

"FINE!" "好极了！"

She let go and I fell, quite hard, on my butt.  
她松手了，我一屁股重重地摔在地上。

"Finally. I don't want to use force on you. Hehehe."  
“终于。我不想对你动粗的。呵呵呵。”

"Ohhhh. No wonder thy hands are shaking, huh. My gratitude to you sir. But whatever. Let's settle this once and for all. Ask me anything and everything you wanna know."  
“哦……难怪你的手在颤抖，是吧。感谢你，先生。不过无所谓了。让我们一劳永逸地解决这个问题。你想知道什么，尽管问我。”

Invading Ayanami's space was cool, not because I enjoy home crashing. Its just that her stuffs are totally fascinating. Visiting her was beyond expectation, it didn't even cross my skull, so when our professor held out the print-outs for today's lesson, I saw a little bubble of opportunity and before it pops, I grabbed it.  
闯入绫波的空间感觉很酷，并非我热衷于擅闯民宅，而是她的物品实在令人着迷。拜访她完全出乎意料，我从未想过会有这样的机会，所以当教授递出今天的讲义时，我瞥见了一丝机遇的气泡，未等它破灭，我便紧紧抓住了它。

I'm not in the mood to explain how her unit looked, where is where, throwing out every possible adjectives to describe each corner. This feels dreamy, its not sinking in. She's not miss more than meets the eye, that's patterned in every story its getting dull. When you constantly keep an eye on her, which is kind of stalkish at some point, you'll get a vibe there's something strange about her. Whether its good or bad, its pretty unpredictable but still, you wanna push forward and play Sherlock Holmes. Ayanami, most of the time is intimidating, she's got this thick barrier hugging her, its too threatening to touch. That's why standing right on the floor of her apartment was a limited edition, once in a blue moon, jackpot prize.  
我此刻没有心情去细述她的住所模样，哪里是哪里，用尽所有可能的形容词去描绘每一个角落。这一切感觉如梦似幻，难以置信。她并非表面所见那么简单，这在每个故事中都已司空见惯，令人乏味。当你持续关注她，某种程度上近乎跟踪，你会隐约感到她有些异样。无论好坏，都颇为难以预料，但你仍想深入探究，扮演一回夏洛克·福尔摩斯。绫波多数时候给人以威慑感，她周围仿佛有一层厚厚的屏障，触碰起来过于危险。因此，能站在她公寓的地板上，简直是难得一遇、千载难逢的大奖。

"Sit anywhere you like. Drinks?"  
随便坐，喝点什么？

"Thanks, but i'm good. You got awesome things."  
谢谢，但我很好。你有很多很棒的东西。

"My little treasures. Zip it. If you tell a single soul about them i'll give you one-way ticket to the afterlife."  
我的小宝贝们，闭嘴。要是你们敢向任何人透露半点风声，我就送你们一张单程去阴间的票。

"Aye, aye ma'am!" “是，是，女士！”

Her little treasures inside her big treasure chest are composed of a huge collection of guro manga, obviously, anime and western action figures, a bit surprised by that, a corner with anything blue like a blue alarm clock, a blue teddy bear, then there's a cabinet filled with origami and cube art, another one with matryoshka dolls, a table filled with black candles of different sizes and shapes with... holy macaroni! Is that a voodoo doll?  
她那巨大的宝箱里藏着许多小宝贝：一大堆猎奇漫画，显然，还有动漫和西方动作玩偶，对此她略感惊讶，一个角落里摆满了蓝色的物品，如蓝色闹钟、蓝色泰迪熊，还有一个装满折纸和魔方艺术的柜子，另一个柜子里则是套娃，一张桌上摆满了各种大小形状的黑蜡烛，还有...天哪！那不是个巫毒娃娃吗？

"Okay, let's start... Hmm..."  
“好吧，让我们开始...嗯...”

"Why are you behaving the way you... behave?"  
“你为什么表现得像……你平时那样？”

"Haha! Blunt aren't we. Well... i'm sick. With an incredibly, crazy unique disorder. Every day, I live with a different personality. Nothing else changes, just the way I behave and my mood. I still know the same people, I still love the things that I love."  
"哈哈！直截了当，是吧。好吧...我病了。一种极其罕见、疯狂的独特疾病。每天，我都带着不同的个性生活。其他一切不变，只是我的行为和情绪会变。我依然认识同样的人，依然热爱我所爱的事物。"

"Where are your parents?"  
"你的父母在哪里？"

"I killed them." “我杀了他们。”

I tensed up, she sounded too serious and... terrifying.  
我紧张起来，她的语气太过严肃，甚至...令人恐惧。

"HAHA! Gotcha." "哈哈！骗到你了。"

"HAHAHAHA. You're such a joker Ayanami-san. Hahahahaha."  
“哈哈哈哈。绫波同学，你真是个笑话高手。哈哈哈哈哈。”

My heart skipped several beat, I packing swear. Is this what I get from having intense curiosity? I'm right! So damn right! Ayanami Rei is a labyrinth in human form. Insane multiple personality disorder? She's ultra mega sweet and then when I flip the next page she's going to stab me with her fingernail, she doesn't even have to think twice.  
我的心跳漏了几拍，我发誓。这就是我强烈好奇心的下场吗？我完全正确！太对了！绫波零简直就是个人形迷宫。疯狂的多重人格障碍？她超甜美，结果我翻到下一页她就要用指甲捅我，她甚至不需要犹豫一下。

"I don't live with them since last 5 years. I'm such a pain in my mom's fat ass and dad's manly boobs they can't handle me well. They sent me in a psychiatric ward when I chopped off Katy's head. It wasn't on purpose, honestly. I was holding a knife and it slipped off my hand, Katy happened to pass by and I don't know how but the knife went freaking nuts and cut off Katy's head.. like a mad psycho. My poor cat. I tried to stich it back, promise but it was a huge failure. They thought I butchered Katy, it was the knife!"  
"我已经五年没和他们一起住了。我真是我妈那肥臀和我爸那男子汉胸膛的痛，他们根本应付不了我。我砍掉凯蒂的头后，他们就把我送进了精神病院。说真的，那不是故意的。我当时拿着刀，手一滑，凯蒂刚好经过，不知道怎么搞的，那刀就跟疯了似的，把凯蒂的头给砍了下来，像个疯子一样。我可怜的猫。我试着把它缝回去，真的，但结果一团糟。他们以为我宰了凯蒂，是那刀干的！"

Unconceivable, what the hell was she saying, my thoughts were scattered and my skull's gonna explode anytime soon.  
难以置信，她到底在说什么，我的思绪一片混乱，脑袋随时都可能炸开。

"O-of course! It wasn't your fault. It was all that stupid knife's doing! How could they do that to you. Tch."  
“当然！这不是你的错。都是那把愚蠢的刀惹的祸！他们怎么能这样对你。啧。”

Ride on, ride on. That was all I could do, but I'm entirely sure I don't know what she might do if I object her.  
继续前行，继续前行。我能做的只有这些，但我完全确定，如果我反对她，我不知道她会做出什么。

"Isn't it? My gosh! Thanks Ikari! They wouldn't believe me! you're the only soul!"  
“不是吗？天哪！谢谢一诚！他们不会相信我的！你是我唯一的依靠！”

She jumped onto me and hugged me with all her might. I was frozen in place, hard as a rock. Should I hug her back? Shoot. I'm brain-dead, I don't know how to respond!  
她猛地跳到我身上，用尽全力抱住我。我僵在原地，硬得像块石头。我该回抱她吗？糟糕。我脑子一片空白，不知道该怎么回应！

Screw it. Its not School Days, I can't take such risks.  
管他呢。这不是《校园日子》，我可不能冒这种险。

"Uhmmm. Ayanami? I need to go. Its getting late. Hehe."  
“呃嗯。绫波吗？我得走了。天色已晚。呵呵。”

"Huuuuh? You idiot. 7pm is late for a guy these days?"  
“哈？你这笨蛋。现在七点对男生来说算晚吗？”

"Ehhh.." "诶..."

"Fine.. Fine.. You can go. Its not like I invited you to come anyways. And it looks like its going to rain anytime soon."  
好吧...好吧...你可以走了。反正我也没邀请你来。而且看起来马上就要下雨了。

She smirked and let go, we stood up in unison and I can't believe she let it slide just like that. I literally dragged my feet, I was deeply disturbed, worse I might've been scarred,  
她轻蔑一笑，松开了手，我们同时站起身来，我简直不敢相信她就这样放过了我。我拖着沉重的脚步，内心深受困扰，更糟糕的是，我可能留下了心理创伤。

Ayanami turned the knob, I turned to look at her. I was preparing myself at any possible attack she might give me. She smirked and ruffled my hair.  
绫波转动门把手，我转头看向她。我正准备应对她可能发起的任何攻击。她轻蔑一笑，揉乱了我的头发。

"You look anemiac! Haha. Get a grip Ikari. Not of those are real."  
"你看起来脸色苍白！哈哈。振作点，碇。那些都不是真的。"

EH? 哎？

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"I killed no kitty, you dummy. But who knows.. one day I might. My disorder was the only legit thing I told you. I've never been in a psychiatric place, too. I'm visiting a doctor every now and then, though. I'm in a stage where I could still control my emotions but my doctor told me my case might get worse as time passes by."  
"我没杀小猫，你个傻瓜。但谁知道呢...也许有一天我会。我唯一对你说实话的就是我的病。我从未住过精神病院，也从未。不过，我偶尔会去看医生。我现在还能控制自己的情绪，但医生告诉我，随着时间的推移，我的病情可能会恶化。"

"Ayanami..." "绫波..."

"Shut the hell dude! I don't need sympathy, believe me. I took the day off because I'm having second thoughts about our friendship. I had fun the other day but I couldn't risk it. To hurt you, and myself as well. But thanks! Damn. Before I get too cheesy you need to get going."  
"闭嘴，伙计！我不需要同情，相信我。我请了一天假，因为我对我们的友谊产生了疑虑。前几天我玩得很开心，但我不能冒险。伤害你，也伤害我自己。不过还是谢谢你！该死。在我变得太矫情之前，你得走了。"

"I'm... Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks a lot."  
“我……是啊。谢谢。谢谢你。非常感谢。”

"You understand what this means right?"  
“你明白这意味着什么吧？”

I nodded. 我点点头。

"Can I bite your lips?"  
“我可以咬你的嘴唇吗？”

"Wha-?" "什-？"

She gave me no time to protest. No, no.. I won't elaborate what she did. Let's just say there's two letter Ts involved. And its wet.. bloody... hot.  
她根本没给我抗议的机会。不，不...我不会详细描述她做了什么。只能说涉及两个字母 T。而且湿漉漉的...血淋淋的...热辣辣的。

I was completely blown away, next thing was I felt the cold railings against my arms. I opened my eyes, I didn't even remember closing them! Ayanami broke the kiss, if you call that a kiss, and did something ridiculous.  
我完全被震撼了，接下来我感觉到了冰冷的栏杆贴着我的手臂。我睁开眼睛，甚至不记得自己闭上了它们！绫波结束了那个吻，如果你称之为吻的话，然后做了件荒唐的事。

"What the fu-" "什么鬼-"

I saw her grinning, intently watching me as I descended down the apartment complex. Yes! The biatch pushed me! Right after kissing, uhm... biting me, she's killing me! Or so I thought.  
我看到她咧嘴笑着，专注地盯着我从公寓楼上下来。没错！这婊子推了我！就在亲吻，呃...咬了我之后，她这是要杀了我！至少我当时是这么想的。

*Slam!* *砰！*

"How does it feeeeelt?" "感觉如何啊？"

I fell on the dumpster.  
我摔进了垃圾桶。

I was laughing my ass off.  
我笑得前仰后合。

It was breath-taking awful, horrifying but I've never in my entire life experienced such a demented adrenaline rush, I was soo thrilled and... happy.  
那真是令人窒息的糟糕，恐怖至极，但我这辈子从未体验过如此疯狂的肾上腺素飙升，我太兴奋了，而且...很开心。

"You crazy!" “你疯了吧！”

"You called me crazy! Yes I am! You fvckface! BLEH!"  
“你骂我疯了！没错，我就是！你个混蛋！呸！”

"Haha! You don't have to push me if I suck at kissing! I fall from, what the hell, that's the 4th effing floooooor!"  
哈哈！要是我接吻技术烂，你不用推我！我直接从，搞什么鬼，这可是第四层啊！

"HAHAHA! You enjoyed it moroooon! You're welcome! That's my farewell gift Ikariiiiii!"  
哈哈哈！你享受得很吧，小懒虫！不客气！这是我给你的告别礼物，碇君！

The shouting ceased. We look at each other's faces. I couldn't really tell what's her expression. We stayed like that for several minutes when a droplet of water hit my cheek.  
喊声停止了。我们彼此对视，我无法真正读懂她的表情。我们就这样静止了几分钟，直到一滴水珠打在我的脸颊上。

"Hm? Rain?" “嗯？下雨了吗？”

I looked up again and she was gone.  
我再次抬头，她已经不见了。

I tasted the waterdrop, way too salty, and then it started raining.  
我尝了尝那滴水，咸得要命，接着雨就下了起来。

xxx

ooo

xxx

It was the last time I saw her.  
那是我最后一次见到她。

Meh. 呃。

That's a lie. 那是谎言。

I was absorbed into the darkest part of the labyrinth I couldn't find my way out.  
我被吞噬进了迷宫最黑暗的部分，找不到出路。

We've been dating for a month, which seemed like an eternity for me, its a deranged stage of my teenage life.  
我们交往了一个月，对我来说仿佛永恒，这是我青春期疯狂的阶段。

"Shinji! Where on earth did you come from, you're 5 minutes late!"  
"真嗣！你到底从哪儿冒出来的，已经迟到五分钟了！"

Yeah. Its monday and for some unknown reasons she's behaving the worst during mondays. But this i'm certain, every effing day of my life is something i'll look forward to, with a big surprise waiting for me.  
是啊。每到周一，不知为何她的脾气就特别糟糕。但我敢肯定，我生命中的每一天都充满了期待，总有一个大大的惊喜在等着我。

"Sorry Rei. I kinda overslept."  
"对不起，绫波。我有点睡过头了。"

"Do that again and i'll fvcking kill you, I mean it."  
再敢那样，我他妈真会杀了你，我说真的。

"I'll rape you before you could kill me."  
"我会在你杀我之前强奸你。"

"Stupid rapist!" "愚蠢的强奸犯！"

"Drop dead gorgeous murderer!"  
"死得漂亮的杀人犯！"

Rei Ayanami is my personal guro manga. A guro manga made only for me. I know how crackbrained she could be, and yet I find her as an extremely huge page turner, I just couldn't get enough.  
绫波零是我个人的血腥漫画。一部专为我而作的血腥漫画。我知道她有多么疯狂，但即便如此，她仍是一个极富吸引力的角色，让我欲罢不能。

And what Am I to her?  
那我在她心中算什么？

Right now I'm a stupid rapist.  
眼下，我不过是个愚蠢的强奸犯。

But yesterday she said I'm her strawberry shortcake.  
但昨天她还说我像她的草莓蛋糕。

Hehe. 呵呵。

### Comment
qwertyui: I can tell you got lots of stuffs running inside your head. Definitly one of stranger Shinji x Rei stories. But unusual fics tend to stay in your head longer.  Hope your sill updating your fic Stage Play
我能看出你脑海中思绪纷飞。这无疑是众多碇真嗣 x 绫波零故事中较为奇特的一篇。但不同寻常的作品往往更能在记忆中留存久远。期待你继续更新《舞台剧》这篇同人。

[StraightedgeWingZero](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1488919/StraightedgeWingZero): Very intriging to say the least its nice,to finally and WING ZERO MEANS finally see another Shinji/REI story got any other Shinji/Rei love story ideas
至少可以说非常引人入胜，终于能看到另一篇真嗣/丽的故事真是太好了，还有其他真嗣/丽的爱情故事点子吗？

[H-MangaEnthusiast](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4404184/H-MangaEnthusiast):
First off, bitches love guro manga… can’t miss with that, my friend… unless you show then Hell Season… then it’s just awkward…  
首先，婊子们喜欢猎奇漫画……用这个准没错，伙计……除非你给他们看《地狱季节》……那就尴尬了……

School Days reference… my favorite harem… it’s like you love me, man…  
Now about criticism stuff…  *sigh*  
《日在校园》的梗……我最喜欢的后宫……感觉你懂我，兄弟……现在说说批评的事……

I don’t usually read hard ooc stuff. It’s not my thing for many reasons. Your characters (because let’s be reasonable, this here are not Shinji or Ayanami) got characterization only by referencing pop culture stuff – which puts them in certain social groups we are all aware of – but that shouldn’t be. Ayanami is a wacko, without plausible explanation or anything, or even background that explains it. We just know that she’s weird and that she sees a psychiatrist or smth… she’s not lovable or anything similar… I guess your aim was some sort of comic relief. Having character for comic relief would be Kensuke… not Ayanami for god’s sake… It could happen in many ways, but not like this, man. Then again, I don’t usually read hard OOC stuff.  
我一般不读严重 OOC 的作品。这不符合我的口味，原因很多。你的角色（因为说实在的，这里不是真嗣或绫波）只是通过引用流行文化来塑造性格——这让他们属于我们熟知的一定社会群体——但不应该这样。绫波是个怪人，没有任何合理的解释或背景来支撑。我们只知道她很奇怪，还看心理医生之类的……她并不可爱或类似……我想你的目的是某种喜剧效果。喜剧角色应该是剑介……而不是绫波，看在上帝的份上……这可以有很多种方式，但不是这样，兄弟。不过，我一般不读严重 OOC 的作品。
  
You write from POV, which can usually confuse a lot… You don’t describe where shit happens or do many descriptions about scenery, and that, my friend, can confuse the hell out of someone. You do place changes in one line… and that is not good. Descriptions are useful for setting atmospheres or moods. Guro manga, for example, tends to be as bloody as possible for: either making you sick or making you harder. If you actually wrote guro stuff and portrayed bloody organs and usual guro stuff it would be better than just giving character’s perspective of things. You can even use someone’s POV to describe everything, mixing his view in it. It also works. Though, remember this: mixing POV and usual narration in past tenses is not hard. Heck, even I use that. Bottom line: give more attention to descriptions and settings.  
你采用第一人称视角写作，这通常会让很多人感到困惑……你没有描述事件发生的地点，也没有对场景进行详细的描绘，这会让读者一头雾水。你在一段文字中切换场景……这并不好。描述对于营造氛围或情绪非常有用。比如，血腥漫画往往会尽可能地血腥，要么让你感到恶心，要么让你更加兴奋。如果你真的写血腥内容，并描绘出血淋淋的器官和常见的血腥元素，会比仅仅给出角色的视角要好。你甚至可以用某个角色的视角来描述一切，将他的视角融入其中。这样也行得通。不过，记住这一点：将第一人称视角和过去时态的常规叙述结合起来并不难。见鬼，我也会用。总之：多关注描述和设定。
  
You describe secondary characters in one line… if you use them already give them some space to breathe. Or at least more than one line… feeling and atmosphere… you know.  Don’t be a fucking pussy and rate this fucking fuck M if you want to fucking curse. It would be better than hearing fucking refrigerator. God fucking refrigerator. Fuck… Now, seriously. I believe that curses would fit in this… it might sound cute when Rei does it (let’s be real, she could fart and it would be cute), but I doubt people go around and say: fuvking and refrigerator. It’s just dumb for so many reasons…  
你对次要角色的描述只有一行……如果已经使用了他们，就给他们一些空间来展现。或者至少不止一行……感受和氛围……你懂的。别他妈的怂，如果你想骂人，就把分级定为 M。这总比听到“该死的冰箱”要好。天杀的冰箱。操……现在说正经的。 我认为咒骂在这里挺合适的……听起来当丽这么做时可能很可爱（说实话，她放个屁都可爱），但我怀疑人们会到处说：“该死的”和“冰箱”。这有太多愚蠢之处……
  
The point of this one-shot is somehow unexplained to me. It’s clearly shipping, but it’s just that… it’s linear… and it’s hardy about eva characters with so much ooc. It feels like you did a story of completely different people that only share names with those 2 we all know. You need some practice to make something more of it, I believe. People usually do it better in longer stories. You may try it in longer stories because it’s just weird one-shots.  
这篇短篇的意图对我来说有些不明。显然是在配对，但也就那样……很直白……而且几乎没有关于 EVA 角色的描写，太出戏了。感觉你写的是完全不同的人，只是碰巧用了我们熟悉的两个名字。你需要多加练习，让故事更丰富，我相信。通常在较长的故事中人们会做得更好。你可以尝试写长篇，因为这种短篇显得有些奇怪。
  
I am not telling you to stop doing your stuff and succumb to my ways. Though, I would seriously advise you to give more attention to the characters. It’s all about the characters. Give them some simple background, some space, more interactions, more lines. Give them more life. Your interactions are good, definitely go further with that, and with some polishing you could shine.  
我不是让你放弃自己的风格，屈从于我的建议。不过，我真心建议你多关注角色。一切都围绕角色展开。给他们一些简单的背景，一些空间，更多的互动，更多的台词。赋予他们更多生命力。你的互动写得不错，在这方面继续深入，稍加打磨你就能发光。
  
I wouldn’t really say it’s bad… but you know. Not my thing… I guess.
我不会说这很糟糕……但你知道，不是我的菜……大概吧。
