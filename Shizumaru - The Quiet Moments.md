An Oddzilla Productions fanfic, by Andrew Huang.The Quiet Moments.A side story of The Heart, the Soul.Based on Neon Genesis Evangelion, c. Gainax Studios and ADVision.  
由 Andrew Huang 创作的 Oddzilla Productions 同人小说，《静谧时刻》。《心与魂》系列的衍生故事。原作为 Gainax 工作室与 AD Vision 版权所有的《新世纪福音战士》。

Shinji sneezed.

The sneeze was enough to wake him up, and he blinked his eyes open,gradually adjusting to wakefulness.  
那个喷嚏足以把他从睡梦中唤醒，他眨了眨眼，逐渐适应了清醒的感觉。

There was a little light, enough for him to see fine strands of brownishred hair floating in front of his eyes. Apparently, that was what had beenbrushing against his nose to trigger his reaction. There was a smell ofshampoo, too.  
微弱的光线下，他看清了眼前漂浮的棕红色发丝，原来正是它们轻拂过他的鼻子，才引发了之前的反应。空气中还弥漫着洗发水的香气。

Warm. Soft. Hmm. And then, a sigh. Something shifted, and Shinji foundhimself facing Asuka, who was showing the signs of waking up, in his arms.  
温暖而柔软。嗯。随后，传来一声叹息。似乎有什么动了，真嗣发觉自己正面对着阿苏卡，她在他怀中渐渐醒来。

He blinked again.  
他再次眨眼。

"Shin...?" She shivered slightly, though it was warm. He drew her nearerto himself, and she buried her face in his chest.  
"Shin...?" 她虽身处温暖之中，却仍不禁微微颤抖。他轻轻将她拉近，她便将脸深埋进他的怀抱。

The nightmares... Right. Asuka cried out last night, before he hadfallen asleep himself. When he had run in, he found her on the floor,awake and sobbing. He couldn't leave her alone, not like that, of coursenot. She fell asleep soon after, and...now, here they were. Yes.  
那些噩梦...没错。昨晚，在阿苏卡惊叫之前，他自己还未入睡。他冲进去时，只见她躺在地上，清醒着，泪流满面。他自然不能置她于不顾。不久后她便入睡了，而现在，他们就在这里。确实如此。

"Why don't they go away? It's been almost a week since, already, and I,I..." She breathed shakily. "I hate it."  
他们怎么还不离开？都快过去一周了，我，我……" 她颤抖着呼吸，"我真的很讨厌这种感觉。

Yes, those damn nightmares.  
没错，就是那些烦人的噩梦。

Shinji shook his head. He still wasn't very good with this. "I, I don'tknow. I think, after...after Mom was gone, it was pretty bad for me,too..."  
真嗣摇了摇头，他在这方面依旧不太在行。“我，我不太清楚。我想，自从妈妈离开后，我也过得很不好...”

She groaned softly. "You're not helping."  
她轻声叹息：“你这根本没帮上忙。”

"Uh...sorry." A few words tumbled around in his head. "It's okay. Don'tworry. Just, just rest. We don't have school today, no tests, and Misato'sprobably already out by now..."  
呃...抱歉。" 几个词在他脑海中盘旋。"没事的，别担心。好好休息吧。今天学校放假，没有考试，真嗣大概已经出门了...

She nodded, and wrapped an arm around his torso. They lay there,quiescent, for a few minutes.  
她点头示意，随即用一只手臂环绕他的身体。两人就这样静静地躺着，过了几分钟。

"Shinji?"

He looked at her.  
他凝视着她。

"...don't leave me."  
...别丢下我。

He leaned forward, placing his forehead against hers. "Asuka," heanswered, after a moment, "don't _you_ leave me."  
他倾身向前，额头紧贴着她的额头。片刻后，他轻声说道：“明日香，你也不要离开我。”

She looked at him. There was silence. Then she began to giggle.  
她凝视着他，四周一片静默。接着，她忍不住咯咯地笑了起来。

Shinji suddenly found himself to be very confused. "Hey, wha, what's sofunny?"  
真嗣突然感到一头雾水，问道：“嘿，这，这有什么好笑的？”

Asuka calmed herself a little. "I can't believe we just said somethingso corny." She lowered her voice in mock melodrama. "'Don't _you_ leaveme.' It's like something out of a bad romance novel."  
明日香稍稍平静下来，半开玩笑地压低声音说：“真不敢相信我们刚才说了那么肉麻的话。‘你可别丢下我。’听起来就像是从劣质言情小说里抄来的台词。”

After a couple of moments contemplating that, Shinji shook his head, andchuckled. "Yeah, I guess. But then, I wouldn't have believed...well, allof _this_, two weeks ago." He sighed. "This is so crazy. I still don'tunderstand."  
沉思片刻后，真嗣摇摇头，轻声笑道：“嗯，确实如此。但两周前，我怎么也不会相信眼前这一切。”他叹息一声，“真是太不可思议了，我依旧难以理解。”

"Me neither," replied Asuka. Her voice was fainter now, the laughterhaving disappeared from it. She sank slightly in Shinji's embrace.  
"我也是," 阿苏卡回答道。她的声音变得微弱,笑声已不复存在。她在真嗣的怀抱中略微下沉。

"Yeah." Shinji leaned his head back, and closed his eyes. So much hadbeen going on. Some things that almost didn't happen, did. Some thingsthat might have happened, didn't. Where could he even begin? No, it wouldbe easier to stay with what he knew, right here at the present. He couldunderstand...he could understand someone, a girl, this girl, lying in hisarms. Well-maybe he couldn't quite grasp that fully.  
"嗯。" 真嗣仰起头，闭目沉思。近来纷扰不断。有些本可能错过的，却意外发生；有些或许会发生的，却未曾出现。从何谈起呢？或许，守在当下，把握已知，更为简单。他能够体会...能够体会一个女孩，此刻依偎在他怀中的女孩。当然，这感受或许还未完全渗透他的心。

Close enough.They dozed for a just a while longer, in this comfortable setting.  
差不多。他们在这舒适的环境里又小憩了片刻。

Asuka emerged from the bathroom, toweling her hair dry, as she didusually, after finishing her bath. Upon reaching her room, she carefullychecked to see that a certain other person had already left before quicklygetting dressed for the day. She exited her room to the sound of somethingsizzling, quite loudly, in the kitchen. And then, there was this deliciousaroma...  
明日香沐浴完毕，如常用毛巾擦拭着湿漉漉的头发，步出浴室。回到房间后，她细心确认某人已离去，随即麻利地换上日常装束。踏出房门，厨房传来的滋滋声响颇为刺耳，紧随其后的是一阵令人垂涎的香味...

"Sausages," she mumbled, while attempting not to drool. She marchedsingle-mindedly towards the promise of good food, and came upon Shinji atthe stove, holding a pan of something spitting just a bit of oil with loudcrackling sounds. He heard her footsteps, and turned.  
"香肠，"她喃喃自语，极力克制着不流口水。她满怀期待地走向美食的诱惑，发现 Shinji 正在炉边，手持一锅食物，锅中油花四溅，发出阵阵噼啪声。听到她的脚步声，他转过身来。

"Well, here's some 'real food', like you've wanted." He grinned. "I knowit's already afternoon, but...well, I picked this up last night, whenMisato and I went shopping for food. I thOWOWOWOW! Dammit, that hurts!"  
看，这是你想要的'真材实料'。" 他笑着说，"虽然已是下午，但这是昨晚我和美里购物时顺便买的。哎呀呀呀呀！真疼！

He dropped the spatula on the ground, nursing the spot on his arm wherea largish blob of oil had splattered. Whimpering slightly, he darted tothe sink and ran some cold water over it. Asuka just stared.  
他失手让铲子掉落在地，轻抚着胳膊上被一大滴油溅到的部位。他轻声呜咽，快步跑到水槽边，用冷水冲洗。明日香只是静静地看着。

"...Shinji? You've been piloting an EVA for about a year now, and alittle bit of hot cooking oil gets to you like that?"  
...真嗣，你驾驶 EVA 都一年多了，怎么一点热油就让你受不了了？

He glared at her.  
他怒视着她。

She didn't laugh at him, as tempted as she was. She didn't even smile,although her lip quirked rather badly before she managed to get that undercontrol. Rather, she simply picked up the spatula, nudged him aside at thesink to wash it, and went to the stove to tend to the links sizzling inthe pan. "We got any eggs, too?" Her voice was almost-almost-free of anywavering indicating the suppression of amusement.  
她并未嘲笑他，尽管内心很想。她甚至没有露出笑容，尽管她的嘴角在控制住之前扭曲得厉害。她只是拿起刮刀，在洗碗池边轻轻推开他，清洗刮刀，然后走到炉子旁照看在平底锅中滋滋作响的香肠。“我们还有鸡蛋吗？”她的声音几乎——几乎——没有透露出任何表明她在压抑笑意的颤抖。

"Huh? Oh, yeah, of course..." Out of the corner of her eye, she watchedShinji open the refrigerator and retrieve four brown eggs. "Here." He setthem down on the counter next to the stove.  
"嗯？哦，对了，当然..." 她用眼角余光瞥见 Shinji 打开冰箱，拿出四个棕色鸡蛋。"喏。" 他把鸡蛋放在炉子旁的台面上。

Asuka finished cooking the sausages, putting them on a plate, then friedup the eggs quickly, two for the each of them. They divided up thesausages as well, and then sat down at the table to eat.  
明日香将香肠烹饪完毕，摆放在盘子上，紧接着快速煎好鸡蛋，每人分得两个。之后，他们一同坐下，开始享用这顿饭。

"Hey, not bad," commented Shinji. "You don't usually want to cook..."  
嘿，挺好的，" 真嗣说道。"你平时可不怎么喜欢做饭啊...

She shrugged. "No, I don't. Don't like to get oil burns, I guess," shesaid, smirking faintly as she held up a wrist that was faintly spotted."But I don't complain that much when I do."  
她耸耸肩，说：“不，我不喜欢。大概是怕被油烫伤吧，”她边说边轻笑，举起手腕，上面隐约可见油渍。“不过真烫到了，我也不会太抱怨。”

"Huh." Shinji mock-sulked for a few moments, but smiled himself, after afashion. He ate in silence for a bit, then asked, "What do you want to dotoday?"  
嗯。" 碇真嗣裝作鬧情緒片刻，但很快也露出了笑容。他靜靜地吃了會兒，接著問："今天你想做點什麼？

Asuka blinked. "Do? I...I don't know. Hadn't thought about it." Sheswirled a sausage in some yolk on her plate and critically eyed the bit ofcoronary disease on a fork. "You have any ideas?"  
明日香眨了眨眼，说：“做什么？我...我还没想过。”她用叉子卷起香肠，在盘里的蛋黄中搅了搅，然后审视着叉子上那块可能对心脏不好的食物，问道：“你有什么主意吗？”

Shinji sighed, and rested his chin on his hands. He turned his eyes tothe open window, and the sunshine streaming in through it. "Something toget out of here. We've been indoors, mostly, for the past week. I mean,it's been Headquarters, or school, or the infir...um. You know."  
真嗣叹了口气，双手托着下巴。他转头望向敞开的窗户，阳光正透过它洒进来。“得想办法出去透透气。过去一周我们基本上都待在室内，不是总部就是学校，或者医疗室...你懂的。”

She looked up at him, at that, and caught his nervous gaze. No, I'm notgoing to appear weak. I'm not still weak. "Yeah." I think. "Well, I guessthat be nice. Out to the park, maybe? Then we'll see from there." Shegrinned.  
她抬头望向他，捕捉到他那紧张的眼神。不，我不会示弱。我已经不再软弱。“嗯。”我想。“好吧，去公园或许不错？之后再看情况吧。”她露出了微笑。

"Sounds good. Come on. Let Misato wash up when she gets home. It's herturn today, anyway." And now, he grinned.  
"听起来不错。来吧。等三乡回来后，就让她洗漱吧，今天本来就该她了。" 他此刻露出了笑容。

---

The sun shone brightly, and the air was warm, but not hot. Quite a fineday for a stroll.  
阳光灿烂，气温宜人，正是散步的好天气。

Shinji glanced over at Asuka, sweating slightly. She was wearing thislight blue silk blouse and a short black skirt. Not something he'd everseen her wear before, and...he rubbed his nose, which felt a bit ofpressure. He looked down at himself. His dark blue school uniform pantsand the white shirt. Absolutely bland. He sighed.  
真嗣瞥向明日香，见她额上微微冒汗。她身着一件淡蓝色丝绸衬衫搭配黑色短裙，这身打扮他前所未见。他不由得揉了揉鼻子，感到一丝压迫。再看自己，一身深蓝校裤配白衬衫，单调得令人叹息。

"Ooh! Look over there! Come on!" And Shinji found himself yanked alongat speed towards a stand set up at a crossing of footpaths in the park.  
"哦！看那边！快来！" 就这样，真嗣被迅速拉着，朝着公园里小径交汇处的一个摊位奔去。

"Hey! Slow down! I'm gonna fall, I'm...gah. How can you run so fast inthat, that...um. I mean. Heh." He rubbed his nose again.  
"嘿！慢点儿！我要摔了，我……哎呀。你怎么能在那种情况下跑这么快，那个……呃。我是说。呵呵。" 他再次揉了揉鼻子。

Asuka looked at him strangely. "What are you talking about?" She shookher head. "Buy me some shaved ice," she declared imperiously. The grin shewore slightly marred the effect, though.  
明日香疑惑地盯着他。"你到底在说什么啊？"她摇摇头。"去给我买份刨冰，"她带着一丝傲气命令道。只是她嘴角的微笑稍稍减弱了这份气势。

Shinji chuckled nervously, and bought a bowl of shaved ice withcondensed milk and red bean paste (as dictated to him), handing it toAsuka. That's funny, he mused...she's complained about eating so muchJapanese food, but I think that's just about as Japanese as you canget...and she sure is enjoying it.  
真嗣有些紧张地笑了笑，按照吩咐买了一碗加了炼乳和红豆沙的刨冰，递给明日香。他心里觉得挺有趣...她总抱怨吃太多日本菜，但这刨冰可谓是地道的日本风味...看她吃得津津有味。

"Aren't you going to have any?"  
你不打算吃点吗？

"Huh? What?" Shinji blinked, startled out of his thoughts. "I'm not inthe mood for it, I guess."  
啊？什么？" 真嗣一愣，从沉思中回过神来。"我猜我现在没什么兴致。

"Not in the mood?" Asuka frowned, pausing with the spoon halfway to hermouth. "Come on, it's good."  
心情不好吗？" 明日香皱起眉头，勺子停在半空中。"尝尝看，真的很好吃。

"I...well..." He shrugged, helplessly.  
"我...这个..." 他无奈地耸了耸肩。

Asuka hmphed. "I'm not going to have to force you to have some, am I?"She took the spoon away from her mouth, and started maneuvering it towardShinji's face. He looked at her nervously, instinctively tilting his headbackward as it came closer. "Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Just aslong as you don't bite first." A toothy smile sprang to her lips.  
明日香哼了一声。“难道非得我逼你吃不可吗？”她从嘴边挪开勺子，开始向真嗣的脸部靠近。他紧张地望着她，本能地往后仰头，勺子逐渐逼近。“放心，我不会伤害你的。只要你别先咬我。”她嘴角勾起一抹俏皮的笑容。

Shinji's eyes now bulged. This was really weird, now. She'd never saidanything like _that_ before. But, well...he started leaning back towardher, toward the spoon she held in front of him, opening his mouth. Andjust as he was about to touch the spoon with his lips- "What? Hey!"  
真嗣的眼睛瞪得溜圆。这情况真是前所未见，她以前从没说过那样的话。然而，他还是不由自主地向她倾斜，朝着她举在面前的勺子，张开了嘴。就在他的嘴唇即将碰到勺子的一刹那——“什么？喂！”

Asuka grinned at him, the handle of the spoon now poking out from hermouth. "Gotcha!" She giggled madly while he scowled at her. "Oh, stopmaking faces at me. You're just too much fun to tease."  
明日香冲他咧嘴一笑，勺柄从嘴里探出。"抓到你了！"她疯狂地咯咯笑着，而他则对她怒目而视。"哎呀，别对我做鬼脸了。逗你玩真是太有趣了。"

He watched her continue to giggle for a minute more, finishing off therest of the shaved ice and shooting him amused glances. Eventually, thefrown on his face slowly relaxed away, to be replaced by a faint smile.Well, this is better than what she might have been like, instead. I guessI should be glad. "Well, come on...let's keep walking, okay?"  
他注视着她又笑了一会儿，吃完剩下的刨冰，还不时投来逗趣的眼神。渐渐地，他脸上的不悦缓和下来，浮现出一抹浅笑。这样总比她可能的反应要好。我应该感到庆幸。“好了，走吧...我们继续散步，好吗？”

She nodded, and they continued along, toward the lake that sat in thecenter of the park.  
她点头示意，随后两人继续向公园中心的湖泊进发。

---

The look on his face had been priceless, Asuka mused, as she stared outover the water.  
阿苏卡沉思着，他脸上的表情真是无价之宝，她凝视着水面。

The water...hah, some lake this was. Barely even a pond. Feh, who werethey trying to kid? Just some little hole in the ground with a bit ofwater dumped into it. And, and-  
这水...哈，这哪算得上湖，顶多是个小水坑。呸，他们想糊弄谁呢？不过是地上挖了个小坑，倒进去点水而已。而且，而且-

"I like this place," said Shinji.  
真嗣说：'我喜欢这个地方。'

...and Shinji liked it. Don't upset him; don't ruin the day. "It's kindof small."  
...真嗣挺喜欢的。别惹他不高兴，别把这天搞砸了。“就是有点小。”

"It's peaceful."

Asuka nodded. She had to give him that, at least. "You come here a lot,don't you? You seem so, so, comfortable here."  
明日香点头表示认同。至少在这点上，她得承认他。"你常来这儿吧？看你在这儿挺自在的。"

"Yeah. I remember the first time I came. Well, sort of. It was after oneof the earlier Angel attacks; I don't know which one. They start to runtogether after a while, you know?"  
对，我记得第一次来这儿的情况。嗯，算是记得吧。那是在早前某次天使袭击之后，具体哪次我也记不清了。这种事经历多了，时间一长就容易混淆。

"...no, I don't think so." Asuka ground her teeth. I really don't needto think about it. Change the subj...ect? Asuka's train of thought haltedwhen she felt Shinji's hand cover hers lightly. She sighed.  
"...不，我不这么认为。" 明日香咬着牙，心想我真的不必深究此事。换个话题...？就在这时，她感觉到真嗣的手轻轻地覆在了她的手上，思绪顿时中断。她不由得叹了口气。

"I'm sorry."

"And stop apologizing. I could have sworn that I'd told you not to saythat all the time."  
别再道歉了。我记得明确告诉过你，别老是把那句话挂在嘴边。

Shinji paused at this, blinking. He muttered, "Either you or Misato. AndI can't remember which one of you it was, either."  
真嗣停顿了一下，眨着眼，低声说道：“不是你就是美里，我记不清到底是你们谁了。”

Asuka laughed, laughed genuinely if softly. "That would be like the twoof us, huh?" She looked out over the water again, falling silent. Almostunconsciously, she shifted her hand slightly and gently curled her fingersaround his.  
明日香轻声而真挚地笑了。“这还真像我们俩的风格呢，不是吗？”她再次凝视着水面，陷入了沉默。几乎是不自觉地，她轻轻挪动了下手，温柔地用手指环绕住他的手。

"This is the first time I've actually come here with someone," Shinjisuddenly said. Asuka turned to him, a bit startled by his speaking in thesilence. She studied him carefully, as he turned his face to her to lookher in the eyes.  
"这是我第一次真正带人来这里，"新之助突然开口。明日香被他的话语惊了一下，转头看向他。她仔细打量着他，而他则转过脸，目光直视她的双眼。

Ah, those eyes of his, again...  
哎，又是他那双眼睛...

"...you _would_ say something as soppy as that, wouldn't you?" Shegrinned widely.  
"你果然会说这种肉麻话，不是吗？" 她笑得十分灿烂。

Shinji looked a bit hurt, as expected. "Don't you ever let up?" hewhined. It was starting to feel a little more like the old days. But notquite.  
果然，真嗣显得有些受伤，他带着哀怨的语气说：“你就不能稍微放松一点吗？”这情景开始有点像往昔，但又似乎不尽相同。

Asuka giggled, poking playfully at his shoulder. "Of course not! I'm thegreat Souryuu Asuka Langley! I never let up!" And in due course, Shinjistarted laughing too. Before long, though, they both subsided into theirprevious silence, again just looking out over the pond.  
明日香咯咯地笑起来，顽皮地戳了戳他的肩膀。“怎么可能！我是伟大的葛城明日香兰格雷！我从不言弃！”没过多久，真嗣也跟着笑了起来。然而，他们很快又恢复了之前的静默，再次静静地望着池塘。

Why did I say that, the young redhead wondered to herself. It had ratherruined that moment.  
年轻的红发女孩暗自纳闷：我怎么会说出那样的话？它无疑破坏了那一刻的美好。

Because it was scary, she answered herself a second later. To loseherself in his eyes-it was a warm, wonderful thing, but also...scary.  
因为感到害怕，她稍后才自答。沉浸在他的目光中——虽然温暖而美妙，但也不免……令人心生畏惧。

Bleah. Be strong, dammit.  
哎呀。要坚强，拜托了。

She then leaned, slightly, placing her head against Shinji's shoulder.He stiffened-for an instant.  
随后，她轻轻倚靠，将头枕在真嗣的肩膀上，他顿时感到一阵僵硬。

But...it's nice to have help, when I have to be strong. Yeah.  
不过...在我必须坚强的时候，能有帮助确实挺好的。嗯。

---

The afternoon had worn on, and it was now reaching the early evening.The sun reached that certain place in the sky where it was possible tolook straight at it without hurting your eyes, and it illuminated the landwith a fiery red light.  
午后时光悄然流逝，此刻已近傍晚。太阳升至天空中某个特定位置，此时直视它也不会刺眼，它以炽热的红光普照大地。

Shinji felt fervently poetic at this point, but he was cursed with alack of the ability to follow through on the impulse. So, he settled for,"That's a pretty sunset."  
此刻，真嗣满怀诗情，无奈欠缺将冲动化为行动的能力。最终，他只是淡淡地说了一句：“夕阳挺美的。”

The two were now walking back to the apartment, side by side. Asuka hadbeen mostly quiet, now, just enjoying the scenery. She nodded absently,murmuring a soft, "Yeah," but nothing more.  
两人正并肩返回公寓，阿苏卡此时大多沉默，只是静静欣赏着四周的景致。她心不在焉地点头，轻声附和了一句“嗯”，之后便不再言语。

They continued on, and Shinji couldn't help but steal a glance at hisright hand, which was holding on to her left. Rather obviously. In public.  
他们继续走着，真嗣不由自主地瞥了一眼自己的右手，那只手正紧紧握着她的左手。这举动在公共场合显得颇为明显。

Wow.

And yet, and yet-geez, why am I so self-conscious about it, he askedhimself. We'd slept in the same bed last night, for crying out loud. Buthere, with hand-holding, and earlier when she leaned on my shoulder and Ibet I'll keep on doing this... I'm never going to change, am I?  
尽管如此，他仍不禁自问，为何对此感到如此局促不安。昨晚我们明明同床共枕，真是的。但此刻手牵手，以及之前她依偎在我肩头，我猜我会一直这样……我终究无法改变，不是吗？

"Something wrong?" Asuka's question broke through Shinji's reverie,snapping him back to the present. "You were frowning."  
怎么了？" 明日香的话打断了真嗣的沉思，将他拉回到现实中。"你刚才皱着眉呢。

Both stopped walking, now, and looked at each other. Shinji hesitatedfor a moment, and then brought his hand up, still grasping Asuka's. "Whyaren't I used to this? After all we've been through. I mean-last night,we even slepmmmmmph!" Shinji reeled, partly from suprise, partly from theforce with which Asuka had slapped her free hand over his mouth. She waswide-eyed, and blushing furiously.  
两人都停下脚步，此刻，彼此凝视。真嗣犹豫片刻，随后举起手，依旧紧握着明日香的手。“为何我还是不习惯这样？毕竟我们共同经历了那么多。我是说——昨晚，我们甚至一起睡了……”真嗣被惊得后退，一方面是惊讶，另一方面是明日香用她空着的手猛地捂住了他的嘴。她瞪大了眼睛，脸颊绯红。

"Idiot! There are people around, you know!" She looked around quickly,and sure enough, a few were looking their way. Her glare persuaded them toresume their business, however. She sighed, and dropped her hand, turningback to Shinji...who was now rubbing his mouth.  
"傻瓜！你没看到周围有人吗？"她急忙四下张望，确实，有几个人正朝他们投来目光。她的严厉眼神让他们识趣地继续自己的事情。她叹了口气，松开手，转头看向真嗣...他此刻正揉着嘴巴。

"Ow..."

"Oh!" Asuka moved her hand towards Shinji's face again, though in agentle manner this time. However, he instinctively shrank away from her atthis, pulling slightly away, and this prompted Asuka to stop and drop herhand again. "I'm...I'm sorry, Shinji." She bit her lip, looking down ather feet. Apologies still were a little difficult. "I...shouldn't havedone that." Actually, no, it was right to stop him from saying somethingso embarassing-but...oh...  
"哦！"明日香再次轻柔地将手伸向真嗣的脸庞。然而，他本能地避开了她，稍稍后退，这使得明日香停下了动作，再次垂下手。"我……对不起，真嗣。"她咬着下唇，目光落在自己的脚上，道歉对她而言依旧有些生涩。"我……不该那样做。"其实，阻止他说出那番令人尴尬的话是正确的，但是……唉……

"Um. It's okay. I guess I, uh, shouldn't have...mentioned it."  
嗯，还行。我想我不该，呃，提起这事。

They stood in uneasy silence, neither looking at the other. Finally,Asuka started walking again-and was brought up short, with a small yankon the arm from Shinji. They hadn't actually disengaged their hands. Asukagave Shinji an uncertain look, and her fingers twitched slightly, as if tolet go. But Shinji only smiled faintly, and tightened his grip just alittle. She nodded to him, and tugged him in the direction of home, oncemore.  
他们沉默地站着，彼此都不愿对视。Asuka 最终迈步前行，却被 Shinji 轻拽手臂止住。两人的手始终未曾分开。Asuka 带着犹豫望向 Shinji，手指微动，仿佛想要松手。然而 Shinji 只是淡淡一笑，稍加用力握紧。她向他点头示意，再次牵着他向家的方向走去。

They resumed walking quietly, lost in their thoughts for a while. Then,as they turned a corner, Asuka spoke up. "Well. About, about what you weresaying... I know what you mean. It's strange for me too, I mean, I'mnot..." She sighed, turning her head slightly to see Shinji nod at herwords. "Things take...time." I know it's taken me a lot of time to geteven this far, she said to herself. At least, I've made it. Yeah.  
他们再次静静地前行，各自陷入沉思。不久，转过一个街角时，明日香打破了沉默：“那个，关于你之前说的……我懂你的意思。我自己也觉得挺奇怪的，我是说，我并不是……”她轻叹一声，侧头见真嗣对她的话表示认同。“事情总得……花时间。”她暗想，我也是费了好大劲才走到今天。但至少，我做到了。没错。

"We're here," Shinji suddenly announced.  
"我们到了，" 真嗣突然说道。

He dug into his pocket, extracted the keys, and opened the door to theapartment. Both walked in, and he shut the door behind himself. Then heturned to her, and she to him.  
他从口袋中掏出钥匙，打开了公寓的门。两人一同进入，他随后将门关上。接着，他转向她，她也转向他。

They looked at each other, and blinked a couple of times.  
他们彼此对视，眨了眨眼。

"Well, that was nice," he said.  
"嗯，那挺好的，"他说。

"It was, yeah," she said.  
"是的，"她回答道。

They fell silent, still not moving.  
他们陷入沉默，依旧一动不动。

"Was that a date?" he asked.  
"那是一次约会吗？"他问道。

"Why are you asking me?" she asked.  
"你为什么问我呢？"她问道。

And then they shook their heads and laughed. "Yeah, I guess it was,"Asuka admitted. "Thanks."  
接着，他们摇了摇头，笑了起来。"嗯，我想确实是这样，"飞鸟承认说。"谢谢你。"

"Thank you."  
感谢您。

And again, they stopped, and looked at each other, in silence. Therewas, suddenly, a sort of tension in the air.  
他们又一次停下脚步，默默地相互凝视。空气突然间似乎充满了紧张的气氛。

If it had been a date, then this was the end of the date. Common enoughoccurrence, the end of a date... Only, both parties lived at the sameplace. Saying "good night" wasn't really an option, because both of themwere going to be together, still. Besides, it wasn't night-time yet,anyhow.  
倘若这是一场约会，此刻便是它的尾声。这种情形司空见惯，约会的落幕...然而，两人同住一处。道一声“晚安”并不合适，毕竟他们仍将共处一室。况且，此刻尚未入夜。

All of these thoughts ran through each of their heads, in one form oranother. They both knew it-something had to happen. So, something did.  
这些思绪在两人心中交织，他们心知肚明——总得有所行动。果不其然，事情就这样发生了。

Shinji put a hand on Asuka's shoulder and stepped in close, quickly. Hetilted his head, then pressed his lips to hers for a couple of preciousseconds, before breaking off and drawing away. He smiled, a bitsheepishly, and then ran down the hallway to his room, ducking in throughthe door and sliding it shut once safely inside.  
碇真嗣迅速将手搭在明日香的肩上，靠近她。他微微倾头，轻吻她的唇，短暂而珍贵，随后分开并退后。他略带羞涩地微笑，随即跑向走廊尽头的房间，穿过门后迅速将其关闭。

Asuka, meanwhile, was still standing there. She reached up with a handto touch her lips, at a bit of a loss at what just happened. "He ranaway," she mumbled. With that, she bemusedly turned and walked down thehallway, to her own room, to change into something more normal for beingin the apartment. Her hand was still at her lips, which were now curvedslightly in a faint smile.  
与此同时，明日香依旧站在原地。她伸手轻触自己的嘴唇，对刚才的一幕感到有些不知所措。“他逃走了，”她低声自语。带着这份困惑，她转身沿着走廊走向自己的房间，准备换上更适宜在公寓内穿的便装。她的手仍停留在唇边，嘴角微微上扬，流露出一抹淡淡的微笑。

And Misato walked out of the kitchen, the customary (but, at present,completely forgotten) beer in hand, also with a smile on her lips. "Youtwo are growing up, aren't you? I'm glad, Shinji. I'm glad, Asuka."  
美里手里依旧拿着平时那瓶（此刻却已忘在脑后）的啤酒，面带微笑地从厨房走出。“你们俩都在成长啊，真好，真嗣，还有明日香。”

End.

Finally. Finally done. This short bit, after months of sitting aroundand occasionally being worked on. x.x I hate getting blocks. Ah... Thischapter was partly inspired by a doujinshi of Asuka dragging Shinji out ona sort-of-date. Very nice, very cute, and...it isn't hentai, aw darn. It'scalled "Asuka, Rabukome suru" by a fellow who calls himself "Isutoshi",and can be found in the _All's right with the world_ doujinshi collection,published by Movic. Hard to find, though.  
终于完成了。这段简短的内容，在数月的闲置与偶尔的打磨后终于问世。x.x 我实在讨厌创作中的停滞期。啊...这一章节的灵感部分源自一本同人志，描绘了明日香拉着真嗣去参加一场类似约会的情景。画面温馨可爱，可惜并非色情内容。这本同人志名为“Asuka, Rabukome suru”，作者署名“Isutoshi”，收录于 Movic 出版的《All's right with the world》同人志合集中，但颇为难寻。

Next up will be Misato. I'm rather looking forward to writing her, youknow. I just hope I can do it more quickly than this. n.n;;;  
接下来轮到三乡了。我挺期待写她的，你懂的。希望我能比这次写得更快些。n.n;;;

Again, thank you for reading.  
再次感谢您抽出宝贵时间阅读。
