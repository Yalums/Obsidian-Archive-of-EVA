[Ps3udonym](https://fanfiction.net/u/465540/)
Rain fell on two pedestrians, the constant pitter-patter of water on umbrella drowning out the din of early morning rush hour. The small, flimsy canvas barely covered them, forcing the two to squeeze close against each other to stay sheltered. Close enough to each other that a certain Japanese boy could almost smell the faintest hint of a certain redhead's shampoo.  
雨滴落在两位行人身上，伞面上持续的滴答声淹没了清晨高峰期的喧嚣。那把小而脆弱的伞布勉强遮住他们，迫使两人紧贴在一起以保持干燥。近到那个日本男孩几乎能闻到某个红发女孩洗发水的淡淡香气。

Asuka Langley Soryu was not pleased at all. It was bad enough that she was walking with the pervert who had almost kissed her while she was asleep, but to have to be pressed up against each other? It was like an invitation for him to try again.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷的心情糟透了。和一个差点在她睡着时吻她的变态一起走路已经够糟糕了，还要被迫紧贴在一起？这简直是在邀请他再次尝试。

As a fee for such intimacy, she had made him carry her bag, and the umbrella too. Shinji, despite being stronger than he looked, teetered with the combined weight of two schoolbags and lunches while trying to keep the handle balanced.  
作为这种亲密接触的代价，她让他拿着她的包，还有伞。尽管真嗣看起来比实际要强壮，但他还是摇摇晃晃地承受着两个书包和午餐的重量，同时努力保持伞柄的平衡。

Asuka, scowling at thin metal rods banging against her A-10 connectors, yelled, "Hold the thing higher, idiot! You're messing up my hair!"  
明日香皱着眉头，看着细金属杆敲打着她的 A-10 连接器，大声喊道：“把那东西举高点，笨蛋！你弄乱我的头发了！”

Misato had lost the last of their good umbrellas during one of her dates. Between NERV testing and Angel attacks, none of them had thought to restock. It was pure luck that Shinji had scrounged up the small, extendable cylinder from somewhere in his room. Upon seeing it, Asuka muttered about its lack of a strong backbone, much like its owner, while inwardly thanking him for the promise of a dry walk to school. In the current weather conditions however, she was right: the umbrella was rather hard to keep upright.  
在一次约会中，美里把他们最后一把好伞弄丢了。在 NERV 的测试和使徒袭击之间，他们都没想过要补充。真嗣从自己房间的某个角落翻出那把小巧可伸缩的伞，纯属运气。看到它时，明日香嘟囔着说它缺乏强硬的骨架，就像它的主人一样，而内心却感激他承诺的干爽上学路。然而，在当前的天气条件下，她是对的：这把伞确实很难保持直立。

The wind had picked up since they left the apartment; trees along the sidewalk swayed at 45 degree angles, rocking back-and-forth like leaf-covered metronomes. Shinji raised the handle, his arm sore from the continuous struggle. Unfortunately, this made it harder and harder to keep level, and with a particularly strong gust, rain fell on both of them.  
自从他们离开公寓后，风就变大了；人行道旁的树木以 45 度角摇摆，像覆盖着叶子的节拍器一样前后摇晃。真嗣举起伞柄，他的手臂因持续的挣扎而酸痛。不幸的是，这使得保持伞面水平越来越难，一阵特别强劲的风吹来，雨水淋湿了他们俩。

"Are you stupid? Hold it like this!"  
“你傻吗？要这样拿！”

Not content to wait while Shinji lost his fight against the weather, Asuka snatched the handle from him abruptly. Unfortunately, the sudden change in equilibrium disrupted Shinji's tenuous balance, and sent him sprawling into a not-so-conveniently placed puddle.  
不甘心干等着真嗣与天气抗争，明日香突然从他手中夺过伞柄。不料，这突如其来的平衡变化打破了真嗣那岌岌可危的站立，使他一头栽进了一个并不凑巧的水坑里。

Asuka couldn't hold back her laughter at Shinji's shocked expression, before offering a hand in assistance with a Cheshire grin. After all, he was carrying her bag after all…  
明日香忍不住对真嗣惊愕的表情笑出声来，随后带着狡黠的笑容伸出手去帮忙。毕竟，他正帮她拎着书包呢……

Lucky for him, Shinji kept a change of his school uniform in his locker. Their rain-soaked shoes exchanged for school slippers, the two sauntered into their classroom. A subdued mood hung over most of the students – rainy days had that effect. Hikari Horaki, on the other hand, performed her duties with the same enthusiasm and loud ringing voice as always.  
幸好，真嗣在储物柜里备有一套校服。两人换下湿漉漉的鞋子，穿上学校拖鞋，悠然走进教室。大多数学生都笼罩在一种沉闷的气氛中——雨天就是有这样的魔力。而洞木光则一如既往地以同样的热情和响亮的嗓音履行着她的职责。

"All rise! Bow! Sit down!"  
"全体起立！鞠躬！坐下！"

Their grey-haired teacher adjusted his glasses and started reading out the attendance sheet. A few students were absent (presumably tardy due to the weather), including Rei (presumably not coming). The list of students had dwindled over the last month. Many families had decided that a fortress city with giant monsters and bio-mechanical robots was not a suitable place to raise their children.  
那位灰白头发的老师调整了一下眼镜，开始念起点名册。有几个学生缺席了（可能是因为天气迟到了），包括零（可能不会来了）。过去一个月里，学生名单上的名字越来越少。许多家庭认为，在一个有巨型怪兽和生化机械机器人的堡垒城市里，并不是养育孩子的理想之地。

Shinji just stared outside, observing the rain falling steadily. His monitor blinked with a few messages from Kensuke and Toji, but they went ignored. A spit ball gently reminded him of their urgency with a soft, if moist, impact.  
真嗣只是凝视着窗外，观察着持续不断的雨。他的监视器上闪烁着几条来自剑介和东治的消息，但他置之不理。一颗唾沫纸团轻轻地提醒他注意这些消息的紧迫性，带着一丝湿润的触感。

Shinji looked up just in time to see Toji putting away a straw, snickering from a few desks away. With a sigh, he checked his screen to see what was so important, lest he be hit with more projectiles. First up was a link from Kensuke about the latest news on his favourite anime mecha strategy game series, while Toji had written a dozen sentences involving the repeated uses of the words "breasts", "thighs", and "swim team". Shinji replied to these with noncommittal answers and half-hearted agreements.  
真嗣抬头正好看见东治收起一根吸管，从几张桌子外传来窃笑声。他叹了口气，检查屏幕看看是什么重要的事，以免再次被投掷物击中。首先是来自健介关于他最喜欢的动漫机甲策略游戏系列最新消息的链接，而东治则写了一连串包含“胸部”、“大腿”和“游泳队”重复使用的句子。真嗣对这些回复了模棱两可的答案和半心半意的同意。

Scrolling down the message queue, he was surprised to see one from Asuka.  
他滚动消息队列，惊讶地发现一条来自明日香的。

"Third child, I never properly thanked you for carrying my bag this morning. It's a good thing it didn't get wet when you fell, clumsy boy."  
“第三适格者，我还没正式感谢你今早帮我拿包。幸好你摔倒时它没湿，笨手笨脚的家伙。”

A thank-you mixed with an insult. Only Asuka could combine the two, especially when it had been her fault in the first place. He turned his head to look at the girl; catching a flash of movement as she shifted her gaze to her computer.  
感谢中夹杂着侮辱，只有明日香能将这两者结合，尤其是当这原本就是她的错。他转头看向女孩；捕捉到她目光移向电脑时的一丝闪动。

"_Was she just staring at me?"_ Shinji thought. _"Nah, couldn't have_." He noticed that most of the other boys in the class were looking at her too. To the average Japanese boy, a red-headed, blue-eyed girl was an obviously an exotic sight. Some of the girls glared at her, maybe because of her abrasive personality, or for the fact that she was stealing the gazes of the boys they wished would stare at them instead.  
“她刚才是在盯着我看吗？”真嗣心想。“不，不可能。”他注意到班上大多数男生也在看她。对普通的日本男孩来说，红发蓝眼的女孩显然是一种异国风情。一些女生则瞪着她，或许是因为她那刺人的性格，或是她夺走了她们希望被关注的男孩们的目光。

To Shinji, she was a curious mix of beauty and bitch. They were comrades-in-arms, after all, and with that came a certain trust in each other, a reliance on each other's skills; yet they were competitors, in synch-test scores and for personal pride (at least to Asuka). On top of that, they were roommates.  
对真嗣而言，她是美丽与刻薄的奇妙混合体。毕竟他们是战友，这带来了一种彼此间的信任，依赖对方的技能；然而他们也是竞争对手，在同步测试分数和个人自尊上（至少对明日香来说）。除此之外，他们还是室友。

His hormones cried, _"Come on, dammit, she's your age and she looks like that? Target center…"_ But his brain knew that he had about as much luck with Asuka as Unit-01 had catching an Angel from the sky.  
他的荷尔蒙在内心呐喊：“拜托，她和你同龄，还长得那么漂亮，目标锁定中心……”然而他的理智清楚，自己追求明日香的成功概率，就如同初号机从天空中捕捉使徒一样渺茫。

Yet that might have been part of the charm. As much as Toji and Kensuke's "Devil" nickname for her was exaggerated, that same outgoing personality at least forced him to take notice of her. Her endless energy seemed to be intoxicating at times, especially when it was focused on him.  
然而，这或许正是她的魅力所在。尽管东治和健介给她起的“恶魔”绰号有些夸张，但她那同样外向的个性至少迫使他不得不注意到她。她那无穷无尽的活力有时似乎令人陶醉，尤其是当这股活力集中在他身上时。

Fourteen is a confusing age for a boy, even for one not cursed with Shinji's social skills, but even he knew there was something to the "newlyweds" title the two carried around. After all, all jokes carried at least some grain of truth.  
十四岁对于一个男孩来说是个迷茫的年纪，即便不是像真嗣那样社交技能欠缺，但即便如此，他也明白“新婚夫妇”这个称呼背后总有些什么。毕竟，所有的玩笑都至少包含一丝真相。

The flashing screen signalled another incoming message.  
闪烁的屏幕提示着又有一条新消息传来。

"Awe-struck at my lovely beauty, third child? It's not polite to stare, you know."  
"被我迷人的美貌震撼到了吗，老三？盯着看可不礼貌哦。"

Shinji's face turned a noticeable shade of red.  
真嗣的脸明显红了一片。

Asuka groaned as the bell rang to signal the end of the day. Outside, the rain still hadn't shown any signs of letting up – if anything, it had started to fall even _harder_. Her groan intensified as Hikari came up to her with bucket and towel in hand. By some cruel twist of fate, it was her and Shinji's turn today.  
随着放学铃声响起，明日香发出了一声呻吟。外面，雨依旧没有停歇的迹象——甚至下得更大了。当班长带着水桶和毛巾走过来时，她的呻吟声更大了。命运似乎开了个残酷的玩笑，今天轮到她和真嗣值日了。

He grabbed the mop and started to clean the floor while Asuka wiped the blackboards, unconsciously staring at the blue-eyed boy. Shinji just looked down, going about his tasks wordlessly. A small frown appeared on Asuka's face as he went about the classroom, head lowered.  
他抓起拖把开始清洁地板，而明日香则擦拭着黑板，不自觉地盯着那个蓝眼睛的男孩。真嗣只是低头默默地做着自己的任务。当他在教室里走动时，头低垂着，明日香的脸上出现了一丝小小的皱眉。

It's not that she particularly _hated_ Shinji. It's just that he was just so… boring. Everything about him just screamed mediocrity. Even when he showed some potential, like with Eva, he just settled into a passionless existence. Just the way he dressed most days, from his white shirt to his uniform pants, was so banal and dreary that she wanted to drag him to the nearest mall and teach him about the colour wheel.  
并不是说她特别讨厌真嗣。只是他实在是……太无聊了。他的一切都显得平庸至极。即使他在驾驶 Eva 时展现出一些潜力，他也只是安于一种毫无激情的生活。就连他大多数日子里的穿着，从白衬衫到制服裤，都如此乏味沉闷，以至于她想把他拖到最近的商场，教他认识色彩的奥妙。

So, why didn't she? There was a thought. Even better, it was already the start of the month, meaning that their monthly pilots allowance would be in their accounts. Asuka reached into her pocket and anxiously fingered her NERV card. Even better, today was a rare sync-test free day, even if it was raining.  
那么，为什么她不这么做呢？这是个好主意。更妙的是，现在已经是月初，意味着他们作为驾驶员的月度津贴将会打入账户。明日香伸手摸了摸口袋里的 NERV 卡，感到一阵紧张。更棒的是，今天是个难得的同步测试免除日，尽管外面下着雨。

"Hey Shinji, I'm bored. Want to go shopping?"  
"嘿，真嗣，我好无聊。想去逛街吗？"

"N-now?" the boy stuttered, "but we still have to finish cleaning up… and it's raining."  
"现…现在吗？" 男孩结巴地说，"但我们还没打扫完呢…而且外面还在下雨。"

"Not right now, you idiot, after we finish," Asuka explained, mindlessly wiping over the same area repeatedly.  
"不是现在，你个笨蛋，打扫完再去，" 明日香解释道，无意识地反复擦拭着同一个地方。"

"I'm not sure, Asuka, it's raining pretty hard…" Shinji replied, his voice starting to betray a hint of crumbling resolve.  
“我不确定，明日香，雨下得很大……” 真嗣回答道，他的声音开始透露出一丝动摇的决心。

Hearing his tone, the redhead pressed her advantage. "Come on! We can stop by the mall and I'll even let you watch me try on some outfits," Asuka countered, with a smirk. "Besides, we can get a better umbrella, too!"  
听他这么一说，红发少女趁势追击。“来吧！我们可以顺路去商场，我甚至可以让你看我试衣服，”明日香反驳道，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。“再说，我们还能买把更好的伞呢！”

"Well… alright," Shinji said, his reluctance failing in the face of logic.  
“好吧……那行，”真嗣说道，尽管有些不情愿，但在逻辑面前还是败下阵来。

"Excellent, third child. If you're lucky, some of my great fashion sense might just rub off on you."  
“很好，第三适格者。如果你运气好，我的时尚品味说不定还能传染给你呢。”

---

The mall was somewhat sparse – the rain had driven away most of the usual after-school crowd. Idle shoppers milled around, while a few more goal-oriented customers scrambled to finish their purchases and get home.  
商场里略显冷清——雨水赶走了大部分放学后的常客。闲散的购物者四处游荡，而少数目标明确的顾客则匆忙完成购物，赶回家中。

The two pilots, on the other hand, had lost count of the number of stores they had browsed through. Asuka's tally included a new pair of boots, a new dress she had found on sale, and a pair of designer jeans. Shinji's purchases for the afternoon consisted of a new bright red umbrella (Asuka had picked it out). The old one lay discarded in a nearby trash bin, having broken under the strain of another walk through the rain.  
另一方面，两位飞行员已经记不清他们逛了多少家商店。明日香的战利品包括一双新靴子、一件她在大减价时发现的新裙子，还有一条设计师牛仔裤。而真嗣下午的收获则是一把崭新的鲜红色雨伞（是明日香挑选的）。他那把旧雨伞已被丢弃在附近的垃圾桶里，因为在又一次雨中漫步时不堪重负而损坏了。

Shinji was impossibly hard to shop for. He just couldn't seem to look right in anything. It turned out that the only clothes which seemed to suit his style were the type he already owned: collared shirts and long pants. In the end, she decided to just go with it and picked out for him a few shirts of varying colours and patterns, instead of plain white. Hopefully, they wouldn't be hidden away in the back of his closet.  
真嗣的衣着品味实在难以捉摸。他似乎穿什么都不太对劲。结果发现，唯一适合他风格的衣物就是他已有的那种：带领衬衫和长裤。最终，她决定顺其自然，为他挑选了几件颜色和图案各异的衬衫，而非清一色的白色。希望这些衣服不会被他束之高阁，藏在衣柜深处。

As they headed to the cashier, she stopped in her tracks at the sight of a dark navy blazer hanging nearby. Suddenly changing course, she strode to the rack and grabbed the hanger, practically running back as she shoved it in the Japanese boy's face.  
当他们走向收银台时，她突然在一件深海军蓝的西装外套前停下脚步。她立刻改变方向，大步走向衣架，抓起衣架就急忙跑回，几乎把外套怼到那个日本男孩的脸上。

"Try it on," she ordered.  
“穿上试试，”她命令道。

Shinji meekly took it and did as she asked. The sleeves were a big long for him, and it didn't quite fit at the shoulders, but as soon as he turned around, she knew that it definitely screamed, "buy me!" A quick trip to and back from the rack to grab the right size, and it looked much better on his thin frame.  
真嗣怯生生地接过衣服，按照她的要求穿上。袖子对他来说有些过长，肩部也不太合身，但当他一转身，她立刻明白这件衣服无疑在呐喊：“买下我吧！”她迅速往返衣架取来合适尺码，穿在他瘦削的身躯上，顿时显得合体多了。

Instead of looking like a boy playing dress-up, the jacket actually aged Shinji a bit, lending a bit of much-needed sophistication to his otherwise-dull attire. He wouldn't wear it that often, but Asuka was pleased enough at the thought that she had at least improved his wardrobe just a bit.  
这件夹克并没有让真嗣看起来像是在玩装扮游戏的小男孩，反而让他显得成熟了一些，为原本单调乏味的着装增添了几分急需的精致感。他不会经常穿它，但只要想到自己至少让他的衣橱有所提升，明日香就感到相当满意。

Asuka grinned… and promptly face-faulted when she saw the price.  
明日香咧嘴一笑……但当她看到价格时，立刻惊得目瞪口呆。

"Asuka… I can't afford that…"  
"明日香…我买不起那个…"

"That's alright. You NEED this, third child. Think of it as your birthday present." She hadn't really thought about his birthday; after all, it was so far away, but he did really need it. _"I can always return those jeans,"_ she thought with a pang of sadness.  
""没关系。你确实需要这个，第三适格者。就当是你的生日礼物吧。" 她其实并没有考虑过他的生日；毕竟，那还早得很，但他确实很需要这个。"我可以把那些牛仔裤退回去，" 她带着一丝悲伤想道。

When she dragged him to the counter, the clerk gave the two a small smile as she started scanning the items through. Shinji didn't notice, but Asuka's face turned red and she looked down as she took out her NERV ID. As they walked out, bags in tow, Asuka realized people thought they were a teenage couple on a trip to the mall.  
当她拽着他来到柜台前，店员对两人露出了一个浅浅的微笑，开始扫描商品。真嗣并未察觉，但明日香的脸颊泛起了红晕，她低头掏出了 NERV 的身份证。提着购物袋走出店门时，明日香意识到旁人误以为他们是来商场逛街的年轻情侣。

"_Why am I doing this?"_ she thought, _"Shopping with boring Shinji? Buying something for him? But it's not like it's weird… no, this has been a nice afternoon, but why did I even want to do this in the first place?_" Asuka's attention was focused completely on the question at hand, so much so that Shinji had to grab her hand and pull her away from walking into a column.

重试   

错误原因

"_His hand is warm_._"_ A warm feeling flowed through the redhead's body, from head to toe. She just stared, speechless as Shinji looked back at her. _"His eyes, have they always been blue? Wait, he's saying something… what?"_

重试   

错误原因

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
"明日香，你还好吗？"

Fortunately for her, Asuka recovered from her stupor quickly. "What was that for, you idiot?!" She punctuated her yell with a hit on the head, though not as hard as she usually hit him. "I don't need your help!"  
幸运的是，明日香很快从恍惚中恢复过来。“你这是干什么，笨蛋？！”她一边吼着，一边朝他头上打了一下，虽然不像平时打得那么重。“我不需要你帮忙！”

"Sorr-" "对不起-"

"And don't even apologize, let's just get home."  
"别道歉了，我们赶紧回家吧。"

---

Asuka was quiet as they walked in the rain under the new umbrella. She just looked at her right hand, still tingling from Shinji's touch. For his part was lost in his own thoughts, seemingly oblivious to her thoughts. She adjusted her bags and backpack as she snuck a glance at him.  
雨中，他们撑着新伞走着，明日香沉默不语。她只是凝视着自己的右手，那上面还残留着与真嗣接触后的酥麻感。而真嗣则沉浸在自己的思绪中，似乎对她的心思浑然不觉。她调整了一下手中的袋子和背包，偷偷瞥了他一眼。

_"Why am I still thinking about this? He's a boy. He's just a weak little boy. No boy could ever be enough for the great Asuka Langley Soryu!"_ The use of the word "boy" rang more and more hollow with each repetition in her mind.  
"我为什么还在想这些？他只是个男孩，一个弱小的男孩而已。伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索西尔怎么可能满足于一个男孩呢！" 她脑海中反复出现的"男孩"这个词，越来越显得空洞无力。

No, he wasn't a boy. They weren't children anymore, they were Pilots. A Pilot became something more the moment they sat in those cockpits and let that amber liquid surround them. No one who was entrusted with a hulking mecha armed to the teeth remained innocent or unimportant. Her entire life was defined by this. Who was she to say he didn't deserve a measure of the respect she yearned for?  
不，他已不是少年。他们不再是孩子，而是飞行员。当他们坐进驾驶舱，任那琥珀色液体环绕周身，飞行员便超越了自我。被托付给武装到牙齿的巨型机甲之人，再无天真或无足轻重之说。她的整个生命都以此为界定。她又有何资格断言，他不配得到她所渴望的那份尊重呢？

And they worked so well together…  
他们合作得如此默契……

The wind and rain had become even worse, if that was possible. One of the trees in their path had broken from the strain of the weather; a large branch lay in the middle of the road. Traffic was slowed as cars changed lanes to avoid it. Around them, giant puddles had now formed in the small craters and holes left over from a previous Angel battle. As well funded as the city was, construction crews mostly left these smaller cavities in the ground unfilled, preferring to focus on the larger scars in the city.  
风雨似乎变得更加猛烈，如果这还有可能的话。他们前方的一棵树因天气的压力而折断，一根粗大的树枝横亘在路中央。车辆纷纷变道以避开它，交通因此放缓。周围，先前天使战斗留下的坑洼和洞穴中，如今已积满了巨大的水坑。尽管城市资金充足，施工队大多选择忽略这些较小的坑洞，而更倾向于集中精力修复城市中更大的伤痕。

Shinji came across a large pool of water, and decided to jump awkwardly to avoid it. His right arm carried the new umbrella, which had held up against the weather rather admirably. Unfortunately, he miscalculated how high he leapt, as the canvas was caught in the branches of a dangerously low-swaying maple tree.  
真嗣遇到了一大片积水，决定笨拙地跳过去以避开它。他的右臂携带着新雨伞，这把伞在恶劣天气中表现得相当出色。不幸的是，他错误估计了自己跳跃的高度，结果伞布被一棵危险地低垂摇摆的枫树枝条勾住了。

"Shinji, look out," Asuka warned, her voice falling as she realized what had happened a second too late.  
"真嗣，小心！"明日香警告道，她的声音随着意识到事情发生得太晚而减弱。

The umbrella, snared, was caught in a slingshot action as the tree snapped back. It flew clear of the branches, leaves flying, and the wind took over its trajectory. Shinji and Asuka could only watch as the umbrella flew farther and farther away, twirling furiously like a demented top.  
伞被缠住，随着树枝反弹的弹弓效应，它从枝桠间飞出，树叶随之飘散，风接管了它的轨迹。真嗣和明日香只能眼睁睁看着伞越飞越远，疯狂旋转如同着魔的陀螺。

Instead of yelling at him again, Asuka just grabbed him by the arm. "Come on," she ordered, breaking into a run. Their shopping bags and backpacks went thumping against each other as they furiously hurried along the sidewalk. Asuka was greatly relieved that there were no pedestrians; apparently they were the only two people brave and stupid enough to be outside in this weather. Crossing the street and running straight through a large puddle, she finally ducked into a nearby apartment's doorway, Shinji in tow.  
这一次，明日香没有再次对他大喊大叫，而是抓住了他的手臂。“快点，”她命令道，随即开始奔跑。他们手中的购物袋和背包随着急促的步伐相互碰撞发出声响。明日香深感庆幸，路上没有其他行人；显然，只有他们两个既勇敢又愚蠢，才会在这样的天气里外出。穿过街道，踏过一个大水坑，她最终躲进了附近一栋公寓的门廊下，紧随其后的是真嗣。

The two dropped their bags and started to catch their breath. A small overhang provided adequate enough shelter against the storm. She waited for the inevitable.  
两人放下背包，开始喘息。一小块屋檐提供了足够抵御风暴的庇护。她等待着不可避免的事情发生。

Shinji didn't even get out the first syllable when Asuka snapped at him to stop apologizing. He fell silent at the rebuke. Asuka just looked at him, opened her mouth, and thought better of it. She false-started on the conversation before offering up a meek and obvious observation.  
当真嗣刚要开口道歉时，明日香就厉声让他停止道歉。他因这斥责而沉默。明日香只是看着他，张开嘴，又觉得不妥。她在对话中犹豫了一下，然后提出了一个怯懦而显而易见的观察。

"It looks like we might be a while," Asuka stated. Someone had to break the ice.  
"看起来我们可能要等一会儿了，" 明日香说道。总得有人打破沉默。

"Yeah." Shinji replied, ever the conversationalist.  
"嗯。" 真嗣回答，一如既往地不善言辞。

Drops of water fell from Asuka's hair onto the back of her hand. She looked at it, finally realizing that it was no longer warm from Shinji's touch, just cold from the rain. In fact, her entire body was shivering, soaking wet. The sound of her teeth chattering was noticeable.  
水珠从明日香的头发滴落到她的手背上。她凝视着，终于意识到那不再是从真嗣触摸中残留的温暖，只是雨水带来的冰冷。实际上，她全身都在颤抖，湿透了。她牙齿打颤的声音清晰可闻。

Shinji bent down and grabbed the newly-bought jacket from one of the bags. "Here," he said, "this should be better." He draped it around her shoulders, drawing her close in the process. Asuka felt a familiar warm sensation envelop her as she felt his arms touch her back.  
真嗣弯下腰，从其中一个袋子里抓起一件新买的夹克。“给，”他说，“这个应该会好些。”他将夹克披在她的肩上，顺势将她拉近。明日香感到一种熟悉的温暖包围着她，当他的手臂触碰到她的背部时。

"_I can smell his shampoo_,_"_ she realized. She pulled the jacket around herself in an effort to warm up. The thin jacket wouldn't be much help, but at least he offered.  
"我闻到了他的洗发水味，"她意识到。她拉紧外套，试图让自己暖和起来。这件薄外套起不了多大作用，但至少他提供了帮助。

"Thanks," Asuka whispered. Her teeth were still chattering. Shinji pulled away from her, and before she knew what she was doing, she said, "no," and wrapped her arms tight around him.  
"谢谢，"明日香低声说，牙齿还在打颤。真嗣从她身边退开，而她还没意识到自己在做什么，就说出了"不"，并紧紧地抱住了他。

Startled, Shinji managed to stammer out, "Wha-what are you doing?"  
惊愕之下，真嗣结结巴巴地问道：“你、你在做什么？”

"What does it look like, you idiot?" Asuka shouted. She brought her voice back down. "Body heat. Don't get any wrong ideas."  
"这看起来像什么，你个笨蛋？" 明日香喊道。她压低了声音，"是体温。别想歪了。"

"I-I wouldn't!" Shinji denied, quick to establish his innocence.  
"我-我不会的！" 真嗣急忙否认，急于表明自己的清白。

"Good," Asuka whispered. She closed her eyes and leaned against his chest.  
"好的，" 明日香轻声说道。她闭上眼睛，靠在他的胸前。

"_His chest is soft."_ "他的胸膛很柔软。"

---

Wide-eyed, Shinji tensed up, and did his best to stand there very still. As he realized Asuka really wasn't going to hit him, he relaxed a bit, arms around her waist.  
睁大眼睛，真嗣紧张起来，尽力站在那里一动不动。当他意识到明日香真的不会打他时，他稍微放松了一些，双臂环抱着她的腰。

His survival instinct sated, he looked at the top of Asuka's head, which was currently all which he could see of her. The neural clips kept her hair mostly neat, but one or two strands were still touching his cheeks. He rested his chin on her head, earning an "mmmm..." sound from Asuka, but nothing else.  
生存本能得到满足后，他看着明日香头顶的部分，那是他目前能看到的她的全部。神经夹使她的头发保持得还算整齐，但仍有一两根发丝触碰着他的脸颊。他将下巴搁在她的头上，引来了明日香一声“嗯……”的回应，但除此之外再无其他。

It had been an unordinary day. From freezing rain in Tokyo-3's post-impact perpetual summer to their shopping trip, Shinji's day had taken one strange turn after another. Which had led him to this moment.  
这一天非比寻常。从第三新东京市后冲击时代的永恒夏日中的冻雨，到他们的购物之旅，真嗣的一天经历了接连不断的奇异转折。这一切将他引向了此刻。

He pulled her closer. Even if it was just for body heat, Shinji savoured the moment. For a second, he thought Asuka might break away and start screaming about perverted tendencies, but she dug in closer. The two stayed there for a while, locked in embrace.  
他将她拉近。即便只是为了取暖，真嗣也珍惜这一刻。有那么一瞬，他以为明日香会挣脱并开始尖叫，指责他的猥琐倾向，但她却靠得更近了。两人就这样相拥了一会儿，紧紧依偎。

The rain continued outside, unabated.  
外面的雨依旧下个不停，毫无减弱的迹象。

A/N: This was written over the course of about a week, whenever the urge to write hit me. It's short, and it's intended as a one-shot. Shinji and Asuka aren't two people who just fall in love with one other, but that doesn't mean they can't share a few nice moments every now and again…  
作者注：这篇作品是在大约一周的时间里断断续续写成的，每当写作欲望来袭时便动笔。它篇幅不长，旨在作为一篇一次性完结的故事。真嗣和明日香并非那种轻易坠入爱河的两人，但这并不妨碍他们偶尔共享一些美好时光……

Then again, I could easily think of places where the story could go.  
再者，我很容易就能想到故事可能的发展方向。

No pre-reader was used aside from spell-check; feel free to point out any errors/inconsistencies. Timeline-wise, it's somewhere between the "Shinji tries to kiss Asuka in her sleep" and "Shinji kisses Asuka without any air" of Evangelion.  
除了拼写检查外，没有使用预读者；欢迎指出任何错误或不一致之处。时间线上，它介于《新世纪福音战士》中“真嗣试图在明日香睡着时亲吻她”和“真嗣在没有空气的情况下亲吻明日香”之间。

Edit: Thanks to those who pointed out that I had Asuka's surname mixed up, for some reason o.O  
修订：感谢指出我将明日香的姓氏搞混了，不知为何 o.O

C&C is welcomed and encouraged! Even if it's just to tell me I suck. =D  
欢迎并鼓励评论与建议！即便只是告诉我我做得不好，也请直言不讳。=D
