HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

It was early morning in the Katsuragi/Ikari/Sohryu apartment and one Shinji Ikari, 16-year old pilot of the Evangelion robots, was busy preparing a very special meal.  
这是在葛城/碇/明日香公寓的清晨，16 岁的碇真嗣，一位驾驶着福音战士机器人的少年，正忙着准备一顿非常特别的早餐。

"Mornin' Shinji-kun!" Misato Katsuragi said as she sauntered into the kitchen and went straight for the table, where her precious beer was waiting. She paused as she noticed the beer in a glass with a red rose in it, and a, in her opinion, fabulous breakfast composed of French Toast, sausage and eggs sunny side up. "Uh... what's all this Shinji-kun?" the woman asked.  
“早上好，真嗣君！”葛城美里一边说着，一边悠闲地走进厨房，直奔餐桌，那里有她珍爱的啤酒在等着她。她停下脚步，注意到啤酒杯中插着一朵红玫瑰，还有一份，在她看来，非常丰盛的早餐，包括法式吐司、香肠和太阳蛋。“呃...这是什么，真嗣君？”女人问道。

"It's Valentine's Day, Misato." the boy answered.  
“今天是情人节，美里小姐。”男孩回答道。

Misato looked over at the calender and gasped.  
葛城美里瞥了一眼日历，不禁倒吸一口凉气。

"So it is." she said as she looked at her plate. "What? No chocolates?"  
“果然如此。”她看着自己的盘子说道，“什么？没有巧克力吗？”

"That's for desert." he smiled.  
“那是留给甜点的。”他微笑着说。

After several minutes of eating, in which PenPen was happily munching on his fully cooked salmon, Misato turned to the boy.  
吃了几分钟后，PenPen 正开心地嚼着全熟的鲑鱼，这时，葛城美里转向了那个男孩。

"So... what are your plans for today? You don't have tests or anything for NERV." the woman said as she chomped on her toast.  
“那么……你今天有什么打算？你今天没有 NERV 的测试或其他事情。”女人一边大口咬着吐司一边说。

"I was hoping you'd call the school and tell them I wouldn't be coming in today."  
“我本希望你能打电话给学校，告诉他们我今天不会去上课。”

"Oh? Hoping to avoid all those fan-letters those girls keep sending you?" Misato teased.  
"哦？希望避开那些女孩不断寄给你的粉丝信吗？" 碇真嗣调侃道。

"What fan-letters?" he asked seriously.  
"什么粉丝信？" 他认真地问道。

Misato winced as she realized Shinji never did get any real mail from anyone.  
意识到真嗣从未收到过任何人的真正邮件，碇真嗣感到一阵尴尬。

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"That's my line!" he teased back. "And I just need time to prepare a special Valentines dinner for Asuka." Shinji said as he continued to cook the redhead's breakfast.  
"那是我的台词！"他打趣地回应道。"我只是在为明日香准备特别的情人节晚餐前，需要点时间。" 碇真嗣边说边继续为那位红发女孩做着早餐。

Misato perked up at that. "Oh? Is my little Shinji finally going to propose?"  
听到这话，美里眼睛一亮。"哦？我的小真嗣终于要表白了吗？"

"MISATO!" the boy blushed heavily.  
"美里！"男孩的脸顿时涨得通红。

"Oh, that look is just priceless." she laughed.  
"哦，那个表情真是太值钱了。" 她笑道。

"Stop teasing me or you won't get your Valentine's gift."  
"别再逗我了，否则你拿不到情人节的礼物。"

"OH NO! Anything but that!" she cried playfully, holding her hand over her forehead and waving her other hand at him.  
"哦不！千万别那样！" 她俏皮地喊着，一手捂着额头，另一只手朝他挥舞。

However, the ears of one Asuka Langley Sohryu were listening to this.  
然而，阿斯哈·兰格·索拉尔的一只耳朵却在倾听着这一切。

_Shinji's making me a special Valentine's dinner? And he's taking the whole day off to do it?_ She thought. _I knew it! He's finally going to confess his feelings to me!_  
真嗣要为我准备特别的情人节晚餐？还要为此请一整天假？她想。我就知道！他终于要向我表白心意了！

With that thought in mind, Asuka finished getting dressed and came out to enjoy her European breakfast.  
带着这样的想法，阿斯哈穿好衣服，出来享用她的欧式早餐。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Asuka had enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. She was pleased that she had insisted that Shinji learn how to cook European meals instead of just Japanese. The boy was becoming quite proficient at cooking French, German, and Italian meals, which to Asuka meant FAR more variety in terms of nourishment.  
明日香享受了一顿美味的早餐。她很高兴自己坚持让真嗣学习烹饪欧洲菜肴而不仅仅是日本料理。这个男孩在烹饪法国、德国和意大利菜方面已经变得相当熟练，这对明日香来说意味着营养方面有了更多的多样性。

Currently the German redhead found herself walking to school to inform Hikari of Shinji's absence today. And the reason behind it.  
此刻，这位德国红发少女正步行去学校，告知光今天真嗣缺席的消息以及背后的原因。

_I wonder what kind of meal Shinji is going to make for me? Probably something romantic, like an Italian dish. Spaghetti probably. Not a lot of romantic German meals._ She mentally huffed. _Hmm. Wonder what I should wear? Since it's Valentine's Day, probably something red. Oh! Red Wine to go with the spaghetti! Wait... Misato may not go for that. She'll probably insist on milk for 'Little Asuka-chan'._ She grumbled, but decided to go back to her original happy thoughts regarding Shinji. _I wonder why it took Shinji so long to admit his feelings for me?_  
我在想真嗣会为我准备什么样的饭菜呢？可能是浪漫的意大利菜，比如意大利面。德国菜里浪漫的不多。她心里哼了一声。嗯，我该穿什么呢？既然是情人节，可能应该穿红色。哦！还有红酒配意大利面！等等... 美里可能不会同意。她可能会坚持要'小明日香'喝牛奶。她嘟囔着，但还是决定回到关于真嗣的愉快思绪上。我在想真嗣为什么花了这么长时间才承认他对我的感情呢？

Asuka walked into the school building and met Hikari as she reached her class.  
明日香走进学校大楼，到达教室时遇到了光。

"Asuka! Happy Valentines Day." the pigtailed girl said.  
“明日香！情人节快乐。”扎着马尾辫的女孩说道。

"Yeah, like I couldn't tell." the redhead said as she dumped another batch of letters into the trash can and she had just gotten to her first class.  
"是啊，好像我看不出来似的。" 红发女孩说着，将另一批信件扔进垃圾桶，她刚到第一节课。

"Where's Shinji?" the class rep asked.  
"真嗣在哪里？" 班长问道。

"Oh! He won't be coming today."  
"哦！他今天不会来了。"

"Really? Why?" "真的吗？为什么？"

"He's at home... preparing me a romantic Valentine's Dinner!" she said with emphasis on the last two words.  
""他在家呢...正为我准备一顿浪漫的情人节晚餐！"" 她特别强调了最后两个词。

"Oh, Asuka! Congratulations!" she cheered.  
""哦，明日香！恭喜你！"" 她欢呼道。

"Thanks. I knew the baka couldn't resist me forever."  
"谢谢。我就知道那个笨蛋终究抵挡不住我。"

_And you still call him baka_. She mused.  
你还叫他笨蛋呢。她暗自思忖。

"At least he's going about it in the right way. Romantic dinner, home-cooked, wine, roses, the whole bit." she smiled.  
"至少他追求的方式很对。浪漫晚餐，亲手做的，配上红酒，还有玫瑰，样样俱全。" 她微笑着说。

"Aren't you still a little young for wine, Asuka?"  
"你是不是还太小了，不适合喝酒，明日香？"

"I'm sixteen Hikari. Besides, if I'm old enough to pilot a 40 meter robot, I can handle a little wine." she argued.  
"我都十六岁了，光。再说了，如果我够格驾驶四十米高的机器人，那我就能应付一点酒。" 她争辩道。

Hikari let the matter drop as more students arrived.  
随着更多学生的到来，光不再纠缠这个问题。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

It was almost seven o'clock when Asuka got back to the apartment. It had been a NERV-racking day what with all of Unit 02's special tests that required Asuka be there as well. With the girl returned to the somewhat humble abode, she was greeted to an empty apartment.  
当明日香回到公寓时，已经快七点了。这一天真是让人神经紧绷，因为所有二号机的特殊测试都需要明日香在场。女孩回到这个略显简陋的住所时，迎接她的是一个空荡荡的公寓。

"Shinji! Misato! I'm home!" she called out.  
“真嗣！美里！我回来了！”她大声喊道。

When she didn't hear a reply she stepped into the living room and noticed that the furniture had been moved. She saw a small table set up for two people, with plates, wine glasses, silverware, two tall candles and a small vase with a red rose in the middle of the candles.  
当她没有听到回应时，便走进客厅，注意到家具已被移动。她看到一张为两人准备的小桌，上面摆着盘子、酒杯、银餐具、两根高蜡烛以及蜡烛中间的一个小瓶，里面插着一朵红玫瑰。

_Well done, baka_. She smiled and stepped into the kitchen.  
干得好，笨蛋。她微笑着走进厨房。

She noticed that the oven was on and there was a note on the kitchen table. Addressed to her.  
她注意到烤箱开着，厨房桌上有一张便条。是给她的。

"Hmm. What's this?" she said as she picked up the note. "(Dear Asuka. Dinner is in the oven and will be fully cooked by 7:30. Needed to run out to pick up a few things for the dinner. Dress nice. Shinji) Dress nice? Alright, Shinji-kun." she smiled.  
"嗯？这是什么？" 她边说边捡起那张纸条。"(亲爱的明日香，晚餐在烤箱里，7:30 会完全烤好。我得出去买点晚餐用的东西。穿得漂亮点。真嗣) 穿得漂亮点？好吧，真嗣君。" 她微笑着。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

After a soothing bath and a shampoo rinse with a new scent she bought last week, Asuka went to her room and took her time to dress.  
洗了个舒缓的澡，用上周新买的香味洗发水冲洗后，明日香回到房间，悠闲地打扮起来。

Her choice of outfits was a little red strapless nearly skin-tight number that was low cut just a few inches above the knees, and exposed a fair amount of her cleavage. She had chosen it some months ago for when she would finally go out on a date with Kaji.  
她选择的服装是一件小巧的红色抹胸裙，紧贴肌肤，裙摆低至膝盖上方几英寸，恰到好处地展露了她的乳沟。几个月前，她特意挑选了这件衣服，准备在与 Kaji 的首次约会中穿着。

The intent to wear it soon for the unshaven man.  
原本打算不久后穿上它，去见那位未刮胡子的男士。

She sighed, realizing that it was now going to impress another man's heart. She decided to forgo her neural clips and put the finishing touches on herself with lipstick, lite eyeshadow and a little blush. She smiled as she admired herself in the mirror.  
她叹了口气，意识到这件衣服现在将要打动另一个男人的心。她决定不戴神经夹，而是用口红、淡色眼影和少许腮红来完成最后的装扮。她对着镜子中的自己微笑，欣赏着自己的模样。

Her long bright red hair was neatly brushed behind her back; her creamy flawless skin shown out on her angelic face, her slender neck, her well-toned arms and her long dancers-like legs; she finally had a D-cup sized bust that she was more than proud of; her body had developed curves and bends in all the right places; and the last two years had given the girl at least an extra six inches in height, making her even more stunning than before.  
她那头亮丽的红色长发整齐地梳在背后；她那奶油般无瑕的肌肤在天使般的面庞上闪耀，纤细的脖颈，结实的双臂，以及修长的舞者般的双腿；她终于拥有了引以为傲的 D 罩杯胸部；她的身体在恰到好处的地方形成了曲线和弧度；过去的两年至少让她长高了六英寸，使她比以往更加迷人。

"Asuka!" she heard Shinji call to her from the other side of her door.  
“明日香！”她听到真嗣在门的另一边呼唤她。

"Yes?" she called back. “什么事？”她回应道。

"Dinner's ready whenever you are." he said.  
"晚饭好了，随时可以开动。" 他说道。

"Be right out!" she called, then turned back to the full-length mirror. _Bless me father, for I have sinned_! She smiled devilishly as she air-kissed the mirror, winking as she did.  
"马上就来！" 她喊道，随即又转向全身镜。祝福我吧，神父，因为我犯了罪！她邪魅地笑着，对着镜子做了个飞吻，眨眼间尽显俏皮。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Asuka stepped out of her room and walked towards the living room, following the wonderful smell of dinner waiting for her. When she stepped out of the room, she saw Shinji dressed in a tuxedo with a small napkin on his upheld arm.  
明日香走出房间，朝着客厅走去，跟随着晚餐诱人的香气。当她踏出房门时，看到真嗣穿着一身燕尾服，手臂上搭着一块小餐巾。

"Shinji-kun." she gasped, noticing how nice he looked in his suit, but wondering why he had a small napkin hanging on his arm.  
“真嗣君。”她惊讶地吸了口气，注意到他穿着西装的样子很帅气，但又疑惑他手臂上为何挂着一块小餐巾。

"Whoa! Asuka, you look beautiful." he gasped when he saw the lovely young woman before him.  
“哇！明日香，你看起来真美。”当他看到眼前这位可爱的年轻女子时，他惊讶地吸了口气。

She blushed slightly, which only made her more beautiful to him.  
她微微脸红，这反而让他觉得她更加美丽。

He escorted the girl to the table, pulled her chair out and sat her down.  
他护送女孩到桌边，为她拉开椅子并让她坐下。

"Your appetizers are already set out." Shinji said, indicating a small basket of bread sticks. He lit the candles on the table and then went over to adjust the lighting to a soft glow. "Please enjoy. I'll have your meal brought to you in a few minute's as soon as your dinner date arrives." he said as he walked back into the kitchen.  
“您的开胃菜已经摆好了。” 真嗣说道，指向一小篮面包棒。他点燃了桌上的蜡烛，然后走过去将灯光调至柔和。“请慢用。等您的晚餐约会对象一到，我马上为您送上正餐。” 他说完便走回了厨房。

The second he had said that, Asuka felt her heart drop.  
他一说完，明日香就感觉自己的心沉了下去。

_My_ _dinner date__? But isn't Shinji... I thought that he... then who is he talking about?_ She wondered.  
我的晚餐约会对象？但不是真嗣吗...我以为他...那他到底在说谁？她疑惑着。

The door bell rang. 门铃响了。

Shinji answered it. 真嗣回答了。

"Ah! Mr Ryoji. Please come in." Shinji said to the man.  
“啊！凉二先生，请进。”真嗣对那人说。

"How did I let you talk me into this, Shinji?" Kaji asked as he stepped through the doorway. He had a box of chocolates in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other.  
“我怎么就让你说服我来了呢，真嗣？”薰一边问着，一边跨过门槛。他一手拿着一盒巧克力，另一手拿着一束鲜花。

"It's for a good cause, Kaji." Shinji whispered to the man and then lead him out to the living room. "Ms. Sohryu, your dinner date has arrived." he called as the pair rounded the corner.  
"这是为了一个好理由，加持。" 碇真嗣低声对那人说，然后领他走进客厅。"惣流小姐，您的晚餐约会对象到了。" 他一边喊着，一边两人转过拐角。

"Kaji!" the girl gasped as she saw the grown man wearing a dark blue suit with a white shirt and red tie... and clean shaven face. _He shaved!_  
"加持！" 女孩惊呼道，她看到那个穿着深蓝色西装、白衬衫和红领带，而且脸刮得干干净净的成年男子。"他刮胡子了！

"Asuka. You look beautiful tonight." the man said sincerely.  
"明日香，你今晚真美。" 男人真诚地说道。

"Uh... thank you." she blushed lightly.  
"呃...谢谢。" 她脸上微微泛红。

"Mr Ryoji." Shinji said as he lead the man to his seat across from Asuka, but not before he presented the flowers and chocolates to the girl.  
"Mr. Ryoji." 真嗣一边说着，一边引领那位男士坐到明日香对面的座位上，不过在此之前，他先将鲜花和巧克力递给了女孩。

She thanked him sweetly, but Kaji got the feeling that something was off. She almost seemed disappointed to see him.  
她甜甜地向他道谢，但加持却感觉有些不对劲。她几乎显得有些失望见到他。

As Kaji sat down on the other side of the table, Asuka pulled Shinji down so that only she and him could hear their conversation.  
当加持坐在桌子另一侧时，明日香拉下真嗣，以便只有她和加持能听到他们的对话。

"Shinji, what's going on here?" Asuka whispered to the boy.  
“真嗣，这里是怎么回事？”明日香低声问那个男孩。

"Kaji's your Valentine's dinner date and I'm your waiter." Shinji summed up.  
“加持是你的情人节晚餐约会对象，而我是你的服务员。”真嗣总结道。

Asuka is a little confused, and disappointed, but decided to go along with it for now.  
明日香有些困惑和失望，但还是决定暂时顺其自然。

Shinji poured the wine into the two glasses and had already made sure the musical selection was just right. He then went back into the kitchen in order to retrieve the meal he had prepared for the pair.  
真嗣将酒倒入两只杯子中，并已确保音乐选择恰到好处。随后，他返回厨房去取他为两人准备的餐点。

He was glad that he had already delivered his other Valentines gifts to the other women in his life earlier that day.  
他庆幸自己已在当天早些时候将其他情人节礼物送给了生活中的其他女性。

A chocolate-laden lunch of curry and rice for Misato. (How she could eat that stuff and not have it go right to her hips was a wonder to most people who knew her) A stuffed cat doll with a pink heart on it's belly for Ritsuko. A computer poem for Maya. An arranged date with Toji for Hikari. And a framed picture of himself, Asuka, Misato, PenPen and Rei for Rei at her new apartment.  
为美里准备了一份充满巧克力的咖喱饭午餐。（她怎么吃这些东西而不让它们直接长到臀部，这对大多数认识她的人来说是个奇迹）为律子准备了一个肚子上带有粉色心形的毛绒猫玩偶。给玛雅一首电脑诗。为光安排了与东治的约会。还有一张他自己、明日香、美里、企鹅彭彭和零在新公寓的相框照片，送给零。

This left him at the disposal of Asuka for her special Valentines dinner.  
这使他任由明日香摆布，为她特别的情人节晚餐服务。

For the rest of the evening Kaji dazzled the young redhead with as much stimulating conversation and compliments as he could muster, Asuka doing her best to bask in the attention the freshly shaven man rarely showed her. Shinji stayed out of sight as much as he could.  
当晚剩下的时间里，加持用尽全力与这位年轻的红发少女进行刺激的对话并给予赞美，明日香尽力沐浴在这位刚剃须的男人难得给予的关注中。真嗣尽可能地避开他们的视线。

However, Kaji was a better judge of character than most people would suspect him of being. He knew that Asuka was putting on a front for his sake, and maybe Shinji's as well. And what's more, he knew why.  
然而，加治在识人方面比大多数人所认为的要敏锐得多。他知道明日香是为了他，或许还有真嗣，而故意表现出某种态度。更重要的是，他知道原因。

It was nearly 10:00 when Kaji and Asuka had finished with dinner, even enjoying a couple of slow romantic dances.  
当加治和明日香用完晚餐，甚至享受了几支缓慢的浪漫舞曲时，时间已近晚上十点。

_What's wrong with me? I finally have Kaji all to myself, on Valentines Day, and... I don't want him!_ Asuka mentally gasped as the pair danced the last dance.  
我这是怎么了？终于在情人节这天独占了加治，可是...我却不想要他！在跳最后一支舞时，明日香内心震惊地想道。

"You really are light on your feet Asuka." Kaji flashed his killer smile at the girl.  
"你走路真是轻盈啊，明日香。" 加持对女孩露出了他那迷人的微笑。

"Thank you Kaji-san." she smiled. "Excuse me, I have to use the powder room."  
"谢谢你，加持先生。" 她微笑着说，"不好意思，我要去一下化妆室。"

As she left his side, Kaji couldn't help but notice the usage of '-san' to his name. Normally Asuka would have called him 'Kaji-kun' or something similar, and he sighed in his own frustration. Back in the day, Kaji would never have been willing to spend so much time with Asuka in such a romantic fashion, his attempts to get back with Misato his original goal. And it wasn't like Asuka hadn't become a beautiful and desirable woman. Hell, another year or two and she'd outstrip Misato for the 'Sexiest Woman In Tokyo-3' title.  
当她离开他的身边时，加持不禁注意到她称呼他时加上了'先生'。通常明日香会直接叫他'加持君'或类似的方式，他不由得在内心叹了口气。回想过去，加持绝不会愿意花这么多时间与明日香以如此浪漫的方式相处，他原本的目标是试图与美里复合。而且，明日香并非没有成为一个美丽且令人向往的女性。再过一两年，她甚至可能超越美里，夺得'第三新东京市最性感女性'的称号。

But as he thought back to tonight's dinner date, he realized that it wasn't him she wanted to be with. Once before, maybe, but now... no, he'd kept Asuka at a distance for so long that he was sure her feelings for him had dwindled down to little more than a strong friendship.  
但当他回想起今晚的晚餐约会时，他意识到她想与之共度的人并不是他。曾经或许是，但现在...不，他已将明日香保持距离太久，以至于他确信她对他的感情已减弱至不过是深厚的友情。

_She finally gets over me, and then Shinji drops this in her lap. Oh, boy!_ Kaji mused as Shinji came back into the living room.  
她终于对我释怀了，然后真嗣又给她来了这么一出。哦，天哪！卡吉沉思着，这时真嗣回到了客厅。

"Is everything alright, Kaji?" the boy asked.  
“一切都还好吗，卡吉？”男孩问道。

"I think so, Shinji." the man replied.  
"我想是的，真嗣。" 男人回答道。

"Is something wrong?" "有什么问题吗？"

"Oh... you could say that."  
"哦……你可以这么说。"

"Huh? What? Was there something wrong with dinner? The music not right? Was the wine..."  
"啊？什么？晚餐有什么问题吗？音乐不对吗？还是酒..."

"Shinji, everything was perfect!" Kaji interrupted. "It's just... I don't think Asuka enjoyed being with me, that's all."  
"真嗣，一切都完美极了！" 加持打断道，"只是...我觉得明日香和我在一起并不开心，仅此而已。"

"What? But that's impossible! She loves you!"  
"什么？但这不可能！她明明很爱你！"

"Once, maybe. But after tonight..."  
"曾经或许如此。但过了今晚……"

"I don't understand." "我不明白。"

"Obviously." he smirked. "Let's just say... I'm pretty good at determining a person's mood and all. And Asuka was putting on a front the entire time."  
"显然。" 他嘴角勾起一抹笑。"这么说吧……我挺擅长判断人的情绪之类的。而明日香全程都在装模作样。"

"But why?" "但为什么？"

"I think she was expecting to share tonight with someone else." he said, giving Shinji a noticeable glance.  
"我想她原本期待今晚能与另一个人共度。" 他说着，明显地瞥了真嗣一眼。

It took the boy a few seconds to comprehend what he meant.  
男孩花了好几秒才明白他的意思。

"ME?!" he gasped. "我？！" 他倒吸一口凉气。

Kaji nodded. 卡吉点头。

"But... why? I mean... she's been in love with you ever since I can remember. Ever since I met both of you on the 'Over The Rainbow'. She doesn't even like me."  
"但是...为什么？我是说...自从我有记忆以来，她一直爱着你。自从我在'彩虹之上'遇到你们俩。她甚至不喜欢我。"

"Oh? How can you be so sure of that?"  
"哦？你怎么这么肯定呢？"

"She insults me, demeans me, hits me, calls me 'baka' everyday, makes me do her choirs, cook her food, clean her room and clothes..."  
"她侮辱我，贬低我，打我，每天叫我'笨蛋'，让我做她的家务，给她做饭，打扫她的房间和洗衣服……"

"And yet you do so everyday without a stitch of complaining and go out of your way to prepare such a wonderful romantic dinner for her. Complete with the man she's been crushing on for years." he replied.  
"然而你每天都不抱怨，还特意为她准备这样一顿浪漫的晚餐，包括她多年来一直暗恋的男人。" 他回答道。

"I just thought... I just wanted her to be happy, Kaji." he stated.  
"我只是觉得...我只是希望她能幸福，加持。" 他坦言道。

"So that maybe she'd notice? Or leave you alone?"  
"所以她可能会注意到？或者不再烦你？"

Shinji couldn't answer that.  
真嗣无法回答这个问题。

"Do you love her Shinji?" the man decided to be more straightforward.  
"你爱她吗，真嗣？" 男人决定更直接一些。

Shinji's mouth was open before he could form the words. "...yes. I do. But she doesn't even like me."  
真嗣的嘴张开了，话还没成形。"……是的，我爱她。但她甚至不喜欢我。"

"How do you know that?"  
"你怎么知道呢？"

"Because if she did, she would have been nicer to me at some point." he answered. "I mean... she's never even said thank you for anything I've done for her... like it was just expected of me that I do all those things for her. She didn't even thank me for complimenting her on how beautiful she looked tonight."  
"因为如果她真的喜欢我，她总会在某个时刻对我好一点。" 他回答道，"我的意思是... 我为她做的任何事情，她甚至从未说过一声谢谢... 就好像我为她做的一切都是理所当然的。她甚至没有因为我今晚夸她漂亮而感谢我。"

"Hmm." Kaji mused. "Look, Shinji. I know Asuka as well as anyone. And to put it simply, she likes strong guys. You have to be forward with her as best you can, be assertive but don't force yourself upon her, prove to be her equal while giving her the chance to know you."  
"嗯。" 加持沉思着说，"听着，真嗣。我对明日香也算了解。简单来说，她喜欢强势的男生。你得尽可能地对她主动，要坚定但不要强加于她，证明你是她的平等对手，同时给她机会了解你。"

"But Kaji... I'm not strong. I've never been strong."  
"但是加持... 我不强。我从来都不强。"

"Oh? Say's the mighty 'Killer of Angels'?" he teased. "You who have been beaten, blasted and blown up more than any other Eva pilot. You who endured every psychological trauma that could be inflicted upon him by every human being around from his friends to his father. You who survived Third Impact and rebuilt the world into this paradise of what the world once was after Second Impact and, if I'm not mistaken, brought me back from the dead as well."  
"哦？这不是伟大的‘天使杀手’吗？" 他戏谑道，"那个被击败、被轰炸、被炸飞次数超过任何其他 Eva 驾驶员的人。那个承受了从朋友到父亲周围所有人所能施加的每一种心理创伤的人。那个在第三次冲击中幸存下来，并在第二次冲击后将世界重建为这个天堂的人。如果我没记错的话，你还把我从死亡中复活了。

"You... you just got lucky. You hadn't been dead that long. Not like my mother."  
"你……你只是运气好。你并没有死那么久。不像我母亲。

Kaji smiled gently as he put a hand on Shinji's shoulder. "And what exactly do you want out of a relationship, Shinji?"  
加持微笑着，将一只手放在真嗣的肩膀上。"那么，真嗣，你究竟想从一段关系中得到什么呢？

Shinji bowed his head, but answered right away. "I want a mutual relationship. I want someone to be kind to me, and someone I can care for, take care of. Asuka deserves someone strong, and I'm not. I just..."  
真嗣低下头，但立刻回答道：“我想要一种相互的关系。我想要有人对我好，也有我能够关心、照顾的人。明日香值得拥有一个强大的人，而我不是。我只是……”

"But you are strong, Shinji. Didn't I just give you several reasons why?"  
“但你很坚强，真嗣。我刚才不是给了你几个理由吗？”

"But I wasn't fighting for myself, Kaji. I wasn't fighting to prove anything. I was fighting so that others would be safe. I've never cared what happened to me, I just..."  
“但我并不是为了自己而战斗，加持先生。我并不是为了证明什么而战斗。我战斗是为了让其他人安全。我从未在乎过自己的遭遇，我只是……”

"Shinji!" he said, momentarily interrupting the young man.  
"真嗣！" 他喊道，暂时打断了年轻人的思绪。

"I can't pretend to be something I'm not, Kaji!" he snapped.  
"我无法假装成不是自己的样子，加持！" 他厉声回应。

"And no one's asking you to! But sometimes you can be better than you think you are capable of becoming."  
"也没人让你这么做！但有时候，你可以比你想象的更加出色。"

Shinji pondered that for a second. "I'll think about that, Kaji. Thanks." he said as the man nodded. "And thanks again for doing this."  
真嗣对此思考了一会儿。“我会考虑的，加持先生。谢谢。”他说道，而那人点头示意。“再次感谢你这么做。”

"Hey, I enjoyed spending Valentine's Day with a beautiful young woman. I just wish I wasn't going home alone." he grinned as he pulled a pack of cigarette's out of his jacket pocket and headed out. "Thanks again Shinji."  
“嘿，我很高兴能和一个美丽的年轻女士共度情人节。我只是希望我不会独自回家。”他笑着从夹克口袋里掏出一包香烟，然后走了出去。“再次感谢你，真嗣。”

"Thank you, Kaji." he replied as he escorted the cleanly shaven man out.  
“谢谢你，加持。”他回答道，同时送那位剃得干干净净的男士出门。

Once Kaji was gone Shinji went back into the apartment to start the clean-up. He didn't notice that a certain redheaded girl had been listening in this entire time.  
加治离开后，真嗣回到公寓开始打扫。他没注意到，一位红发少女全程都在偷听。

Asuka eventually came out of her room, still dressed in her red dress. Only now she had forgone her matching red shoes, walking around the living room in her stockings.  
明日香最终从房间里走了出来，依旧穿着她的红色连衣裙。只是这次她没有穿配套的红色鞋子，而是穿着长筒袜在客厅里走动。

"So, did you enjoy your Valentine's dinner?" Shinji asked.  
“那么，情人节晚餐吃得开心吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah, it was great. And you got Kaji to be my dinner date... thank you, Shinji-kun." she said with a soft smile.  
"嗯，太棒了。你还让加持做我的晚餐约会对象...谢谢你，真嗣君。" 她带着温柔的微笑说道。

"You're welcome, Asu... what did you say?"  
"不客气，明日...你说什么？"

"I said 'Thank you, Shinji-kun'. I know I don't say it enough, what with everything we've been through and all, and I..." she started to say, only to fall off into nothing.  
"我说'谢谢你，真嗣君'。我知道我表达得不够多，毕竟我们经历了那么多，我..." 她开始说，却突然语塞。

Shinji said nothing, just continuing to stare at the seemingly fragile young woman before him. The pregnant silence was slowly becoming unbearable as the pair continued to just stand in the middle of the living room.  
真嗣一言不发，只是继续凝视着眼前这位看似脆弱的年轻女子。两人就这样站在客厅中央，那充满期待的沉默渐渐变得难以忍受。

It was then that Shinji got a rather bold idea. He reached over to press the 'Play' button on the CD player, thankful it was within reach.  
就在这时，真嗣突然冒出了一个相当大胆的想法。他伸手按下了 CD 播放器上的'播放'按钮，庆幸它就在触手可及的地方。

The romantic music swept through the room, catching Asuka's attention as she looked at Shinji.  
浪漫的音乐弥漫整个房间，吸引了明日香的注意，她转头看向真嗣。

"Since Valentine's Day isn't over yet... would you mind if I asked for a dance?" Shinji asked.  
"既然情人节还没结束...你介意我邀请你跳支舞吗？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka had a subtle smile on her face as she closed the distance and accepted his hand.  
明日香脸上带着微妙的笑容，她走近并接受了他的手。

The pair held each other closely as they slowly danced in voiceless silence.  
两人紧紧相拥，在无声的静默中缓缓起舞。

It was almost midnight when Asuka's voice caught Shinji's attention. "Do you love me, Shinji-kun?"  
快到午夜时分，明日香的声音引起了真嗣的注意。“你爱我吗，真嗣君？”

He looked into her eyes, unable to find any way around her. "...yes. I do."  
他凝视着她的眼睛，无法找到任何逃避的方式。“...是的，我爱你。”

"Why didn't you ever tell me?" she asked.  
“那你为什么从没告诉过我？”她问道。

"Because I know how you like strong guys, Asuka. And I... I'm not strong."  
"因为我知道你喜欢强壮的男人，明日香。而我...我不强壮。"

"No... but you are kind." she said as she rested her head against his shoulder, burying her face in his chest.  
"不...但你很温柔。" 她说着，将头靠在他的肩上，脸埋进他的胸膛。

Her hands gently trailed down his chest, feeling his well-toned muscles through his dress shirt.  
她的手轻轻地顺着他的胸膛滑下，透过他的衬衫感受着他结实的肌肉。

His hands softly dragged down her back, feeling the firm tone of her body through her silk dress.  
他的双手轻柔地滑过她的背脊，透过丝质裙感受到她身体的坚实线条。

The pair continued to dance slowly, holding each other close as the music carried them past midnight into the next day. Even when it stopped, they continued to hold each other close.  
这对舞伴继续缓缓起舞，彼此紧紧相拥，随着音乐的引领，他们从午夜舞至次日。即便音乐停歇，他们依旧紧紧相拥。

Their eyes met as the silence of the apartment surrounded them.  
当公寓的寂静将他们包围时，两人的目光交汇在一起。

_Come on, Shinji. Read my mind_. Asuka thought as she stared at him.  
来吧，真嗣。读我的心。明日香盯着他，心里想着。

_Does she want this? Do I?_ Shinji thought as his body moved on it's own. _Yes_.  
她想要这个吗？我呢？真嗣想着，身体却不由自主地动了起来。是的。

His lips pressed against hers, softly at first, then sped up with more passion. His arms trailed down the sides of her body, tracing the edges of her stomach and down to her hips, grasping them firmly. A move that he would normally never have done. Her own hands reached up to brush his chest, holding the sides of his face to keep him in place.  
他的唇轻轻地贴上她的，起初温柔，随后加快了节奏，带着更多的激情。他的手臂顺着她的身体两侧滑下，沿着她的腹部边缘，一直滑到她的臀部，紧紧地抓住。这种举动他平时是绝不会做的。她自己的手也伸上去轻抚他的胸膛，捧住他的脸颊，让他保持在原位。

While Asuka's lips worked the front of her face, the back of her mind cursed herself that this wasn't the kiss she and Shinji shared two years ago.  
当明日香的嘴唇在她脸前忙碌时，她脑海深处却在咒骂自己，这并非两年前她和真嗣共享的那一吻。

Shinji's own thoughts were along similar lines as he pushed the redheaded girl up against the nearest wall of the apartment, his tongue darting into her mouth to clash with her own.  
真嗣的思绪也沿着相似的轨迹，他将红发女孩推到公寓最近的墙边，舌头迅速探入她的口中，与她的舌头交缠。

"Mmm! Hmm!" Asuka moaned fiercely as her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him in tightly as Shinji's own hands grabbed underneath her legs and brought them up around his waist. Asuka's ankles locked behind Shinji as he moved his hands up against her back, his lips breaking from her lips and coming down against her neck. "Ah! Shinji! Shinji, wait!"  
“嗯！哼！”明日香激烈地呻吟着，双臂环抱住他的脖子，紧紧拉近他，而真嗣的手则抓住她的腿下，将它们抬到自己的腰间。明日香的脚踝在真嗣身后锁紧，他的手沿着她的背上移，嘴唇从她的唇上移开，落在她的颈间。“啊！真嗣！真嗣，等等！”

"Asuka?" he asked with ragged breath.  
"Asuka?" 他喘着粗气问道。

"Not here." she said, her hot breath washing over his mouth. "My room."  
"不在这里。" 她说道，热气扑在他的唇上。"去我的房间。"

Shinji nodded and pulled Asuka from the wall, carrying her effortlessly to her bedroom.  
真嗣点了点头，从墙边拉起明日香，轻松地将她抱向她的卧室。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Shinji's eyes blinked open, finding them staring at a mass of wavy and unkempt red hair. The girl, now woman, that was resting on top of him shifted her body, bare skin rubbing against his and causing him to fully awaken.  
真嗣的眼睛缓缓睁开，映入眼帘的是一团波浪般凌乱的红发。躺在他身上的女孩，如今已成长为女人，她动了动身体，裸露的肌肤与他相触，让他彻底醒来。

"Good morning, baka-kun." she said sweetly.  
“早上好，笨蛋君。”她甜甜地说道。

"Good morning, Asu-chan." he replied to her, gently nuzzling her nose with his. "How are you?"  
"早上好，阿苏酱。" 他回应道，温柔地用鼻子蹭了蹭她的鼻子。"你怎么样？"

"I feel..." Sigh. "I feel really good, Shinji. You were amazing last night."  
"我感觉..." 叹息。"我感觉非常好，真嗣。你昨晚太棒了。"

"I'm glad you feel good." he said, his hand gently caressing the soft skin of her shoulder.  
"很高兴你觉得好。" 他说着，手轻轻抚摸着她柔软的肩膀。

"Are you, Shinji?" "你是真嗣吗？"

"Yes. I am." "是的，我是。"

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"Yes?" “怎么了？”

"_Why_ do you love me? I mean... I've hurt you, insulted you, belittled you, never once thanked you for everything you do for me?"  
"你为什么爱我？我的意思是...我伤害过你，侮辱过你，轻视过你，从未因为你为我所做的一切而感谢过你？"

Shinji pressed his forehead against hers. "I just want you to be happy Asuka. I just... didn't think you'd be happy with me."  
真嗣将额头贴在她的额头上。“我只是希望你幸福，明日香。我只是……没想到你会因为我而幸福。”

"That's why you set up that dinner with Kaji for me."  
“所以你才安排了那次和加持的晚餐。”

"Yes. Because I thought you were still in love with him."  
“是的。因为我觉得你还是爱着他。”

"I was. Not anymore. I...I'm sorry, Shinji-kun. I'm so sorry!" she cried.  
"我曾是。但现在不了。我...对不起，真嗣君。真的很对不起！" 她哭着说。

Shinji hugged the girl tightly to him as she cried into his chest.  
真嗣紧紧地抱住哭泣的女孩，她的泪水浸湿了他的胸膛。

"Shhh. It's alright, Asuka."  
"嘘，没事的，明日香。"

"No! It's not alright!" she snapped, staring at him with teary eyes. "You've been kinder to me than I deserve... and it's taken me so long to realize the obvious!"  
"不！这根本不是没事！" 她厉声说道，泪眼婆娑地盯着他。"你对我比我所应得的还要好……而我却花了这么久才意识到这个显而易见的事实！"

"Obvious?" "显而易见？"

"It's not strength I want in a man... it's kindness."  
"我想要的不是一个男人的力量……而是他的善良。"

He remained silent as she continued to talk.  
他沉默不语，任由她继续说下去。

"I heard you and Kaji talking last night." she said, noting his surprised-shocked expression. "You've always been strong when other people were in trouble. But the war is over. We're still on-call if we're needed, but we haven't had to fight any monsters or anything for the last two years and... I've been a fool trying to keep being strong. And last night I realized... I don't need strength."  
“我昨晚听到你和卡吉谈话了。”她说道，注意到他那惊讶又震惊的表情。“你总是在别人遇到麻烦时表现得很坚强。但战争已经结束了。如果我们被需要，我们仍然随时待命，但这两年来我们没有再与任何怪物战斗过，也没有遇到过任何事情……我一直试图保持坚强，真是愚蠢。而昨晚我意识到……我不需要力量了。”

"What do you need, Asuka?"  
“你需要什么，明日香？”

She looked at him. "I need kindness, Shinji-kun. I need love! I need someone to care for me, to be there for me."  
她看着他。“我需要温柔，真嗣君。我需要爱！我需要有人关心我，有人在我身边。”

Shinji just stared at the girl, shocked that she would say that. It was so simple a thing, something that Asuka had never said before.  
真嗣只是盯着那个女孩，震惊于她会说出这样的话。这是如此简单的事情，是明日香以前从未说过的。

"But Asuka... you've always been strong. You've never needed anyone else. I've always envied those things about you."  
“但是明日香...你一直都很坚强。你从不需要任何人。我总是羡慕你这些方面。”

"I'm tired of being strong, Shinji-kun." she said. "I'm tired of being Asuka the soldier, Asuka the Eva pilot. I just want to be Asuka... the girl."  
"我已经厌倦了坚强，真嗣君。" 她说道，"我厌倦了做战士明日香，厌倦了做 Eva 驾驶员明日香。我只想做明日香……那个女孩。"

Shinji leaned in and kissed her forehead softly. "Then let me do that for you Asuka. Let me care for you, let me be there for you, and love you, as best I can."  
真嗣轻轻地俯身，吻了吻她的额头。"那么就让我来为你做这些吧，明日香。让我来照顾你，让我在你身边，尽我所能地爱你。"

A warm smile spread across her lips, making her seem, to Shinji, more beautiful than before. "No one could do it better, Shinji-kun."  
她的唇边绽放出一个温暖的微笑，在真嗣看来，她比以往任何时候都要美丽。"没有人能比你做得更好，真嗣君。"

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Author's Notes: 作者的话：

Here's my Valentines Day story. The last one I wrote involved Shinji and Rei, so this time I thought I'd write one up with Shinji and Asuka.  
这是我为情人节写的故事。上次我写的是关于真嗣和绫波的，所以这次我想写一个关于真嗣和明日香的故事。

It may not be quite the quality that many of my other stories are, but I think it's not bad considering how quick I managed to write it.  
虽然它可能没有我其他故事那么高的质量，但考虑到我写作的速度，我觉得它还不错。

I am also working to update my other stories, but I wanted to get this uploaded for Valentines.  
我也在努力更新其他故事，但我想在情人节前上传这篇。

And as always, read and review.  
一如既往，请阅读并留下评论。
