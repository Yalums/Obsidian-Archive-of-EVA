**AsuShin Winter Contest
AsuShin 冬季征文大赛 - 自信 by skyf0x

The cold enveloped the streets, and boredom enveloped Katsuragi's apartment, permeating everywhere. The mind of the once former Evangelion pilot was no exception. Yawning for the fifth time in the last minute, red-haired girl, who resembled a retired pirate, rolled over from one side to the other on the couch.  
寒冷笼罩着街道，无聊也笼罩着葛城家的公寓，无处不在。曾经的前 EVA 驾驶员的思绪也不例外。红发女孩，酷似退休的海盗，在一分钟内第五次打哈欠，在沙发上从一边滚到另一边。

It is time to declare dissatisfaction with the situation in the only way possible.  
是时候以唯一可能的方式表达对现状的不满了。

"Heeellooooooo, Idiiiiiioooooots' deepaaartmeeeeent!" loud yawn mixed with words echoed from the living room. An attempt to sound irritated failed with the ridiculousness of the voice.  
“哈喽喽喽喽，笨蛋蛋蛋蛋蛋们！”深沉的哈欠声夹杂着话语在客厅回响。试图听起来恼火的尝试因声音的滑稽而失败。

The head of the aforementioned department had earned his position well deserved and had no plans to retire. Asuka Langley Soryu had appointed Shinji Ikari as such herself, and everyone was happy with that. Perhaps this was his true calling, and it was more satisfying than his past job.  
上述部门的负责人是实至名归地获得其职位的，并无退休打算。明日香·兰格雷亲自任命了碇真嗣担任此职，大家都对此感到满意。或许这才是他真正的使命，比以往的工作更令人满足。

Being an 'idiot' meant many things. Now it was to open a packet of chips and place them in bowls. Simple task was interrupted by a demanding stare and a resounding "Wark!". The snacks were set aside and Shinji was in the process of preparing dinner for his avian friend. A human voice sounded from the living room just as the last piece of fish laid in the bowl marked 'Pen-Pen'.  
被称为'笨蛋'意味着很多事情。现在则是要打开一包薯片并将其放入碗中。简单的任务被一道迫切的目光和响亮的"Wark!"声打断。零食被搁置一旁，真嗣正忙于为他的鸟类朋友准备晚餐。就在最后一块鱼放入标有'Pen-Pen'的碗中时，客厅里传来了一个人的声音。

Trying to suppress a chuckle, Shinji voiced his thought, "Sometimes she really is a moody cat, right, Pen-Pen?"  
真嗣试图忍住笑意，表达了自己的想法："有时候她真的像只喜怒无常的猫，对吧，Pen-Pen？"

Penguin instantly began devouring the food, bestowing the boy with only an understanding nod.  
企鹅立刻开始狼吞虎咽地吃起食物，只对男孩报以一个理解的点头。

"What are you muttering about?" came the voice from the living room again. More distinct and irritated.  
“你在嘀咕什么呢？”客厅里再次传来声音，这次更加清晰且带着不悦。

No, not a cat. A lioness, ready to attack at any moment. Despite everything that had happened in the last couple of years, Asuka's fiery nature hadn't changed. Sometimes her gaze was so sizzling that Shinji could have sworn her eyes glittered. Even when her left eye was covered by an eyepatch.  
不，不是猫。是一头随时准备攻击的母狮。尽管过去几年发生了那么多事，明日香的火爆脾气丝毫未改。有时她的目光炽热到让真嗣觉得她的眼睛都在闪光，即便她的左眼被眼罩遮住。

Shinji hurried into the living room, carrying two bowls of chips and a slight embarrassment on his cheeks. Wildcat was lying on her stomach, stretching the full length of the couch. The only eye was peeking out from under the armrest so that her mouth was covered by part of the couch and her paws were positioned on either side of her face. Only the cat's ears were missing, but the red hair clips were long gone in the bin.  
真嗣急匆匆地走进客厅，手里端着两碗薯片，脸颊上带着一丝尴尬。野猫趴在沙发上，身体伸展得笔直。只有一只眼睛从扶手下面露出来，嘴巴被沙发的一部分遮住，爪子分别放在脸的两侧。只有猫耳朵不见了，而红色发夹早已被丢进了垃圾桶。

"What took you so long?" Asuka pouted.  
你为什么这么慢？" 明日香噘嘴问道。

Putting one bowl for his roommate on the couch, Shinji began to settle into his usual spot at the headboard of the couch on the floor. "А.. Ah, I was just talking to Pen-Pen," the boy said, nervously scratching his head.  
真嗣将一碗薯片放在室友旁边的沙发上，然后开始在沙发头部的地板上坐下，这是他常坐的位置。"啊...啊，我刚才在和企鹅说话，"男孩紧张地挠着头说。

With a loud chuckle, Asuka squinted incredulously at the brown hair. "You're a talker now?" A handful of chips went into her mouth, while she herself rested her head on her side on the seat of the couch, right behind Shinji's head, staring at the TV.  
随着一阵响亮的笑声，明日香难以置信地眯眼看着那棕色的头发。“你现在变得能说会道了？”一把薯片塞进嘴里，她自己则侧着头靠在沙发座位上，正好在真嗣的脑袋后面，盯着电视看。

"Mm, always have been?" “嗯，一直如此吗？”

A sharp coughing sound startled Shinji, a few crumbs of chips caught in his hair. Asuka choked so hard that it was unclear if the food had gone down the wrong throat, or if she was trying to hold back her laughter.  
一声剧烈的咳嗽声吓了真嗣一跳，几片薯片碎屑卡在了他的头发里。明日香呛得厉害，让人分不清是食物走错了道，还是她在努力憋笑。

Clearing her throat and propping her head up with a hand, Asuka adopted an unreadable expression. "That was the best one today"  
清了清嗓子，用手撑着头，明日香摆出一副难以捉摸的表情。“那是今天最好的了。”

Shinji groaned, "I meant lately!" It was his moment to pout and furiously start chewing snacks.  
真嗣嘟囔着：“我是说最近！”他此刻撅起嘴，开始猛嚼零食。

"Mhm." “嗯。”

"Whatever, what are we watching?" Shinji decided to change the subject.  
"算了，我们看什么？" 真嗣决定换个话题。

"Mmm, let me see," Asuka replied, switching channels. Nothing interesting, just Japanese commercials. Asuka had never understood what could be so amusing about two grown men chewing gum and turning it into different figures, using their own tongues and showing them to each other?  
"嗯，我看看，" 明日香回答道，切换着频道。没什么有趣的，只是些日本广告。明日香从未理解过，两个成年男人嚼口香糖，用舌头将其变成各种形状并互相展示，这有什么好笑的？

The only purebred Japanese man in the room chuckled, "Now I want that gum."  
房间里唯一的纯种日本人轻笑道："现在我想要那款口香糖了。"

The TV was switched instantly to the next channel. Some kind of Christmas movie that Asuka had already seen, something about a blond boy and burglars. "I think this is the only thing we can watch."  
电视立刻被切换到了下一个频道。是一部明日香已经看过的圣诞电影，讲的是一个金发男孩和盗贼的故事。“我觉得这是我们唯一能看的了。”

Asuka squinted at an undecorated Christmas tree in the corner. It was too big of a Christmas tree. Why was it so tall? Asuka could hardly reach the top. Shinji, on the other hand…  
明日香眯着眼看向角落里那棵未装饰的圣诞树。这棵树太大了，为什么这么高？明日香几乎够不到顶端。而真嗣则……

"Speaking of Christmas," Shinji began. "Have you thought about celebration?" There was a nervousness in his voice. "Maybe... together? The three of us, cooking here, spending it like a..."  
“说到圣诞节，”真嗣开口道，“你想过怎么庆祝吗？或许……我们一起？我们三个，在这里做饭，像一个……”

_Family_, Asuka complemented in her mind, blushing. "Like always, you mean?" she corrected her mind. "It sounds boring. Besides, slob will be busy getting drunk with the LGBTQ+ representatives and Loser-Bond."  
家庭，明日香在心中补充道，脸颊泛红。“像往常一样，你是这个意思吗？”她纠正自己的想法。“听起来很无聊。再说，懒鬼会忙着和 LGBTQ+代表还有失败者邦德一起喝得烂醉。”

Slob, LGBT representatives and an unfortunate version of James Bond. New nicknames all the time.  
邋遢鬼、LGBT 代表，还有个倒霉版的詹姆斯·邦德。新绰号层出不穷。

"I don't think he's that bad. Kaji would look great in 'Casino Royale'..." Shinji began.  
"我觉得他没那么糟。加持要是演《皇家赌场》肯定帅呆了……" 碇真嗣开口道。

"Don't even start," a growl sounded in reply. "That's not what I meant. The tree isn't even dressed up." Looking up at the ceiling, Asuka thought out loud, "Isn't Christmas a time for Japanese people to be with friends and..." _Second halves_, her mind added again.  
"别提了，" 一声低吼回应道，"我不是那个意思。那棵树甚至都没装饰。" 抬头望着天花板，明日香自言自语，"圣诞节不是日本人跟朋友团聚的……" 后半句，她的思绪再次补充。

Asuka was grateful Shinji couldn't see how perfectly her face matched the colour of her hair.  
明日香庆幸真嗣看不到她的脸颊此刻与发色完美相映的绯红。

"...Hikari mentioned something about Christmas," Asuka quickly continued.  
"...光提到过关于圣诞节的事，" 明日香迅速接话道。

"Oh... Well, that's good for you" chewing on his chips, Shinji said, not trying to hide a note of disappointment. "And about the Christmas tree, didn't you say something like..."  
"哦...那对你来说挺好的，" 真嗣嚼着薯片说，语气中的失望毫不掩饰。"至于圣诞树，你不是说过类似..."

Coughing up and drawing in more air, with his hand to his chest in a comical manner, Shinji tried to impersonate the smug European girl as best he could. A quick speech, barely reminiscent of his roommate, echoed around the room.  
一边咳嗽一边大口吸气，手捂胸口做出滑稽的样子，真嗣尽力模仿着那位傲慢的欧洲女孩。一段简短的演讲，勉强带有他室友的影子，在房间里回响。

"You Japanese don't know anything about it, you have no sense of style, no spirit of Christmas, no intelligence, no inspiration. Seriously, how can I expect to see anything interesting from people who name new cities just by adding a number to the name of the old city? Tokyo, Tokyo-2, Tokyo-3? And now the interesting part, why is the new city called just Tokyo again? Where is the number 4 missing from your language? If you don't like it so much, why couldn't it be some Neo-To... Hey!"  
你们日本人对此一无所知，毫无时尚感，没有圣诞精神，缺乏智慧，缺乏灵感。说真的，我怎么能期待从那些给新城市命名只是简单地在旧城市名字后面加个数字的人那里看到什么有趣的东西呢？东京、东京-2、东京-3？现在有趣的部分来了，为什么新城市又只叫东京？你们语言里数字 4 去哪儿了？如果你们这么不喜欢，为什么不能是新东京之类的...嘿！

A savage slap interrupted an acting performance.  
一记猛烈的耳光打断了表演。

"I'll do it tomorrow, smartass," the person responsible for the festive mood gritted her teeth, "Now shut up and just let me watch a stupid movie."  
"我明天会做的，自作聪明的家伙，"负责营造节日气氛的人咬牙切齿地说，"现在闭嘴，让我安静地看部无聊的电影。"

"Okay, I'm s-..." tried Shinji, but stopped abruptly when he felt he might get another slap, "I'm silent."  
"好吧，我...我闭嘴，"试图说话的碇真嗣突然停了下来，因为他感觉到可能会再挨一巴掌，"我保持沉默。"

The focus on the film was never quite right. Asuka kept glancing over at the big Christmas tree in the corner. Shinji's head was blocking the view of the TV.  
电影的焦点始终不太对劲。明日香不时地瞥向角落里那棵巨大的圣诞树。真嗣的脑袋挡住了电视的视线。

Her right hand and left eye were starting to itch.  
她的右手和左眼开始发痒。

The top of the Christmas tree, at the very ceiling, stared mockingly at Asuka. The mop of brown hair was all Asuka saw instead of the movie frames. When did Shinji grow up like that? They'd been watching TV exactly the same way for almost a couple of years now, and before the idiot's head had never been obscuring her view.  
圣诞树顶端，紧贴着天花板，嘲讽地盯着明日香。那一头棕色的乱发占据了明日香的视线，而不是电影画面。真嗣什么时候长这么大了？他们这样看电视已经快两年了，以前那个笨蛋的头从未挡住过她的视线。

An angry quick scratching of nails against the skin was heard in the room. There was a bang of some sort in the film. A shuffling sound on the couch ensued, as if someone was trying to get a better fit. Someone squealed comically at the screen. Someone mumbled irritably on the couch.  
房间里传来指甲快速刮过皮肤的刺耳声响。电影中突然响起一声巨响。接着是沙发上的一阵窸窣声，仿佛有人在调整坐姿以求更舒适。屏幕前有人滑稽地尖叫了一声。沙发上有人不耐烦地嘟囔着。

A guilty sigh. "Is the arm making itself known again?" asked Shinji.  
一声内疚的叹息。“手臂又开始作怪了吗？” 真嗣问道。

"And the eye too," Asuka explained, taking off the blindfold, "You know it's always like this in the winter season."  
“还有眼睛也是，”明日香解释道，摘下眼罩，“你知道的，每年冬天总是这样。”

And also when she's nervous, but Shinji didn't know that for sure.  
还有当她紧张时，但真嗣并不确定这一点。

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

Changing from lying down to sitting up, Asuka frowned. "You're like a broken record."  
从躺着变为坐起，明日香皱了皱眉。“你就像个坏掉的唱片，一直重复。”

"You know it's sincere now," turning and tilting his head so he could see the woman on the couch, Shinji said. Rising from the floor, he looked down at the sitting Asuka. "Do you want anything?"  
"你现在知道这是真心的了，" 转身侧头望向沙发上的女子，真嗣说道。他从地板上站起身，低头看着坐着的明日香。"你想要什么吗？"

Slouching her shoulders, the girl rubbed her eye, obscured by her deliberately grown up bangs. Once the itching had subsided a little, the frowning face looked up at Shinji from below. Asuka looked up at the Christmas tree. She looked at Shinji again.  
女孩耸着肩膀，揉了揉被故意留长的刘海遮住的眼睛。待痒意稍减，她皱着眉头从下方望向真嗣。明日香抬头看向圣诞树，又再次看向真嗣。

With a sharp movement, getting up from the couch and turning towards her room, Asuka summed up the end of the evening. "I'd better go to bed," she murmured in a thoughtful tone.  
阿苏卡以一个敏捷的动作从沙发上起身，转向自己的房间，总结了这个夜晚的结束。“我还是去睡觉吧，”她若有所思地低声说道。

Shinji remained standing in the middle of the room at a loss.  
真嗣茫然地站在房间中央，不知所措。

---

The childish problem that reappeared in the young girl's mind did not disappear the next day. The fact that she was taller than Shinji had always been pleasing to her. But now it was not true, nor were many of the things she had believed before. The boy who had saved, destroyed, and saved the world again, had surpassed her in something again, without even wanting it. Shinji had gone through hell hand in hand with her, but now he would not be able to look upon her as an equal, only down on her. For some unknown reason Asuka was sure of that.  
那个在少女心中重新浮现的孩子气问题，第二天并没有消失。她比真嗣高的事实一直是她所乐见的。但现在这不再是真的，她之前所相信的许多事情也不再是。那个曾经拯救、摧毁，然后再次拯救世界的男孩，又一次在不经意间超越了她。真嗣与她携手经历了地狱般的磨难，但现在他无法再平视她，只能俯视她。出于某种未知的原因，明日香对此深信不疑。

To make matters worse, Shinji gained more than just height. He had gained confidence in himself, and that was directly reflected in Asuka's insecurity. Asuka wasn't the only one who noticed the change in Shinji, and right now, with her head resting on her desk in class, she was secretly watching the results.  
更糟糕的是，真嗣不仅在身高上有所增长。他获得了自信，而这直接反映在明日香的不安全感上。注意到真嗣变化的不仅仅是明日香，此刻，她正趴在课桌上，偷偷观察着这些变化的结果。

Shinji was standing with his back to the class, wiping the blackboard, occasionally glancing in the direction of his Cybermonkey-friend. By all appearances, they were talking about some ridiculous things, laughing in between the phrases that were spoken. As Shinji was telling another joke, much to the amusement of Hikari's boyfriend, a girl approached Shinji from the other side.  
真嗣背对着班级，正在擦黑板，偶尔朝他的 Cybermonkey 朋友那边瞥一眼。从表面上看，他们正在谈论一些荒谬的事情，话语间不时爆发出笑声。当真嗣讲到另一个笑话时，光的女朋友也乐在其中，这时一个女孩从另一边走近真嗣。

Asuka noticed that the girl was not from their class. Slender long legs dressed in translucent stockings that accentuated the shape of her legs. A short plaid skirt was the colour of the stockings, framing her hips and leaving not much room for the imagination. A school shirt that was too small for those overly large breasts. If it wasn't for the tie, you could see the buttons trying to come off now and then. Her hair, of unknown colour and texture, was gathered in two ponytails, and her glasses completed the look. Most notable was her height - she was taller than most of the girls in the school. She was taller than Asuka.  
明日香注意到这个女孩并非来自他们班级。她修长的双腿穿着透明的长筒袜，凸显出腿部的线条。一条短格子裙与长筒袜颜色相配，勾勒出她的臀部，留给人的想象空间不多。一件对她那过于丰满的胸部来说太小的校服衬衫，如果不是因为有领带，你几乎可以看到纽扣时不时地想要蹦开。她的头发颜色和质地不明，扎成两个马尾，眼镜完成了整个造型。最引人注目的是她的身高——她比学校里大多数女孩都要高。她甚至比明日香还要高。

Asuka remembered her. The head of the music club, the last year of her studies. Proud posture, smug smile, and not an ounce of embarrassment. Totally different from the type of schoolgirls who glanced at their hero and saviour with embarrassment when he wasn't looking. The kind of girl who approaches a guy on her own and does what she wants.  
明日香记得她。音乐社的社长，学业的最后一年。骄傲的姿态，得意的笑容，没有一丝尴尬。与那些在英雄和救世主不看她们时，羞涩地偷瞄他的女学生们截然不同。那种会主动接近男生，做自己想做的事的女孩。

And she was doing it right now. Her palm touched Shinji's broad back, causing him to react. Asuka frowned. Shinji turned around, smiling embarrassedly, and said something indistinct. Asuka frowned even harder, and turned her ears up.  
而她现在就在这么做。她的手掌触碰到了真嗣宽阔的背部，让他有所反应。明日香皱起了眉头。真嗣转过身来，尴尬地笑着，含糊地说了些什么。明日香的眉头皱得更紧了，她竖起了耳朵。

"Asuka! Eyepatch again?" “明日香！又戴眼罩了？”

Hikari Horaki's voice came out of nowhere, startling Asuka. Turning away from the front of the classroom, Asuka glanced at the politely smiling Class Rep. "You know how it works this time of the year."  
光博子的声音不知从哪儿冒出来，吓了明日香一跳。她从教室前面转过身，瞥了一眼礼貌微笑的班长。“你知道每年这个时候都是这样的。”

Asuka furtively glanced towards the blackboard. The music club head's hand was no longer in contact with the stupid body, but the galsses girl was talking excitedly. Shinji was nodding.  
明日香偷偷地瞥向黑板。音乐社社长的手已经不再触碰那个笨拙的身体，但那个戴眼镜的女孩正兴奋地谈论着。真嗣在点头。

"You know, I feel better," the redhead said despite the beginning itch, lifting her bangs. In one deft movement the dark cloth was removed.  
"你知道吗，我感觉好多了，"红发女孩说着，尽管开始有些痒，她还是撩起了刘海。随即，她熟练地取下了那块深色布料。

A small, barely visible scar, in the form of two round dots above and below the left eyeball, revealed itself. The eyelids opened, showing a difference in iris colour compared to the right eye. While the right eye was bright blue, the colour of the sky, the left eye was cobalt, the colour of the restless sea. A colour just like Shinji's. No one dared comment on this amusing aspect in Asuka's presence, and the long bangs, as intended, slightly covered the left side of her face.  
一道微小且几乎不可见的疤痕，形似上下排列在左眼球上方的两个圆点，显露出来。眼睑缓缓张开，左眼虹膜的颜色与右眼形成鲜明对比。右眼是明亮的蔚蓝色，宛如天空；而左眼则是钴蓝色，恰似波涛汹涌的海面。那颜色，正如同真嗣的一般。在明日香面前，无人敢对此有趣之处妄加评论，而她那特意留长的刘海，也恰到好处地微微遮住了左脸。

"I like you with or without it," Hikari said, following the frown of the girl. Smiling even wider, she continued, "So what about my proposal?"  
"无论有没有它，我都喜欢你。"光说道，顺着女孩的皱眉。她笑得更开了，接着问："那我的提议怎么样？"

"Hmm?" muttered Asuka. She didn't turn her head for an answer, just started tapping her pen nervously on the table. Laughter could be heard near the blackboard.  
“嗯？”明日香嘟囔着。她没有转头寻求答案，只是开始紧张地用笔敲打桌子。笑声在黑板附近响起。

Hikari sighed, "Tomorrow, Christmas, I invite you to my place."  
光叹了口气，“明天，圣诞节，我邀请你来我家。”

There was no response, just a tapping of a pen and a humming as a sign of confirmation. Hikari decided to try again, "Me and Toji invite you and Shinji..."  
没有回应，只有笔尖轻敲和哼唱声作为确认的表示。光决定再试一次，“我和东治邀请你和真嗣……”

"What's wrong with the Idiot?"  
"那个傻瓜怎么了？"

"Now that all your attention is on me," Hikari began meaningfully, "I remind you that Toji and I wanted to spend the holiday together with you and Shinji. No one is going to be home. The cooking is on me, Shinji doesn't need to bother!"  
“既然你现在全神贯注于我，”光意味深长地开始说道，“我提醒你，我和东治原本计划和你还有真嗣一起度过这个假期。家里没人。做饭的事我来，真嗣不用操心！”

Asuka pouted. "I could have helped too." She folded her arms in front of her. "I'm not some princess! And I can cook, ask the Idiot."  
明日香噘起了嘴。“我本来也可以帮忙的。”她双臂交叉在胸前。“我不是什么公主！我也会做饭，不信你问那个笨蛋。”

Hikari's face twisted into a grimace mixed with an awkward smile. Last year's birthday cake for Shinji was fresh in her mind. "So you're coming?" she tried to move the conversation in another direction.  
光的脸庞扭曲成一个夹杂着尴尬笑容的苦相。去年为真嗣准备的生日蛋糕仍历历在目。“那你来吗？”她试图将对话引向另一个方向。

Asuka looked to the front of the class again. No tall girl with glasses was on the horizon. Only the tall Idiot was walking towards his desk. Noticing Asuka, he smiled in a goofy way, pointed his left eye questioningly with the finger of one hand, and with his other hand held his thumb up, tilting his head slightly.  
明日香再次望向教室前方，并未见到那位戴眼镜的高个女孩。只有那个高个子傻瓜正朝着自己的座位走来。注意到明日香，他傻笑着，一手用手指指着自己的左眼表示疑问，另一手竖起大拇指，微微歪着头。

Asuka answered the unvoiced question with her thumb up, nodding her head several times. "I hope we make it, Hikari," she uncertainly replied to the other question.  
明日香用竖起的大拇指回答了那个未说出口的问题，并连连点头。“希望我们能赶到，光，”她对另一个问题不确定地回答道。

---

"Look, this is the most important part of the process. Why did we do all this if we don't have finishing? Not to mention the fact that I love it. I need this, urgently, it's the most perfect moment, you know? It's nothing to you, but it means a lot to me. No one will ever know, no one will ever see. It's not embarrassing, just let me put it in your mouth for just a few seconds and help me..."  
"看，这是整个过程中最重要的一环。如果我们没有完成这一步，那之前所做的一切又有什么意义呢？更别提我对此的热爱了。我急需这个，非常迫切，这是最完美的时刻，你明白吗？对你来说可能微不足道，但对我意义重大。永远不会有人知道，永远不会有人看到。这并不尴尬，就让我把它放进你嘴里几秒钟，帮我一下吧……"

Strange noises began to come from the living room of Katsuragi's apartment as soon as the landlady stepped out the door. Such activity had never happened here before, and if it did, it certainly did not involve former pilots. Although both were close to doing so in the first year after the Third Impact, it didn't happen. Back then, they preferred to spend more time talking. There were too many problems around. One of the pilots had never really done that at all.  
当房东太太一踏出葛城家的门，客厅里就开始传来奇怪的声响。这种活动以前从未在这里发生过，如果有过，也绝不会涉及前任驾驶员。尽管在第三次冲击后的第一年，他们几乎就要这么做了，但终究没有。那时，他们更愿意花更多时间交谈。周围的问题太多了。其中一位驾驶员甚至从未真正尝试过那样做。

So what Shinji saw for the first time in his life this evening would be remembered forever. Asuka, standing on the tiptoes of one leg and pulling the other leg out to the side with all the grace of an acrobat, was holding Pen-Pen high above her head. The penguin in turn held a big gold star in his beak. In front of them stood a marvellously decorated Christmas tree in delicate light colours.  
所以，真嗣今晚第一次看到的这一幕，将会永远铭记在心。明日香单腿踮起脚尖，另一条腿优雅地向外伸展，宛如杂技演员一般，高举着头顶上的企鹅企鹅则用嘴叼着一颗大大的金色星星。在他们面前，是一棵装饰得美轮美奂、色彩柔和的圣诞树。

Shinji knew nothing about Christmas, so for him the style looked amazing. Even so, the higher up the decorations climbed to the top of the tree, the more the flaws in the overall composition were noticeable. Not to mention that something was missing at the very top.  
真嗣对圣诞节一无所知，因此这种风格对他来说已经足够惊艳。尽管如此，随着装饰品逐渐攀升至树顶，整体布局中的瑕疵也愈发明显。更不用说，树顶似乎还缺了点什么。

"I didn't know it is done that way in Germany."  
“我还真不知道德国是这么过圣诞的。”

Pen-Pen turned his head and looked at Shinji, opening his beak to say everything he thought about Germany, especially girls.  
企鹅转过头，看着真嗣，张开嘴巴，仿佛要把他对德国，尤其是对德国女孩的所有看法都说出来。

There was a disgruntled "wark", followed by a resounding "thud" of a star falling. But all this was drowned out by a furious "Scheiße" and a tirade of other probably swear German words.  
一声不满的“嘎”声响起，紧接着是一颗星星坠落的响亮“砰”声。然而这一切都被一声愤怒的“Scheiße”和一连串可能是德语脏话的激烈言辞所淹没。

Asuka was not pleased. "Stupid bird! I only asked a favour once!" With her hands at her sides and leaning over the indifferent penguin, she showed how important the favour was.  
明日香很不高兴。“笨鸟！我只求过你一次帮忙！”她双手叉腰，俯身对着那只无动于衷的企鹅，表明这个忙有多重要。

Pen-Pen clapped his wings and ran away to the safety of his refrigerator space. Shinji decided not to block the penguin's escape route.  
企鹅拍打着翅膀，逃到冰箱的安全空间里去了。真嗣决定不去阻拦企鹅的逃跑路线。

"And you!" Two sparkling eyes stared at Shinji. An index finger was pointed towards him in a defiant manner. "Weren't you in the kitchen with Misato?" A panting Asuka breathed deeply, her bangs stuck to her forehead. Her face was all red, either from anger or shame. "And where is she anyway?"  
“还有你！”两颗闪亮的眼睛盯着真嗣。一根食指以挑衅的方式指向他。“你不是和美里在厨房吗？”喘着粗气的明日香深呼吸，她的刘海贴在额头上。她的脸涨得通红，不知是因为愤怒还是羞愧。“她人呢？”

Shinji had got used to this behaviour of his roommate and now it wasn't causing him annoyance or fear, but only some kind of perverse amusement. Perhaps he just enjoyed spending time with her. It was hard not to be fascinated by how this walking enigma could be cute and intimidating at the same time. A fire in his life, for better or worse.  
真嗣已经习惯了室友的这种行为，现在这不再让他感到烦恼或害怕，反而带来了一种扭曲的乐趣。或许他只是喜欢和她在一起。很难不被这个既是谜团又时而可爱时而令人畏惧的存在所吸引。她就像是他生活中的一把火，无论好坏。

"She went to a Christmas party at work," Shinji replied.  
“她去参加了公司的圣诞派对，”真嗣回答道。

With a sniffle, Asuka turned on the spot, her hair combed into a thick braid flying behind her head and landing on one shoulder on inertia. "What a drunk..." She squatted down and picked up the star, checking it for cracks.  
明日香吸了吸鼻子，原地转身，她那梳成粗辫子的头发随着惯性飞舞，最终落在肩膀上。“真是醉得不轻……”她蹲下身，捡起星星，检查是否有裂痕。

An awkward silence reigned in the flat. Asuka was fixed on the star, but Shinji couldn't see her expression. The girl's slightly slouching back was the only indication of her condition.  
公寓内弥漫着尴尬的沉默。明日香凝视着星星，但真嗣无法窥见她的表情。女孩微微驼背的背影，是她心境的唯一线索。

She broke the silence first, "So."  
她首先打破了沉默，"那么。"

"So."

"What were you talking to that bitch about?"  
"你跟那个贱人聊了些什么？"

"Asuka, I understand that you don't always get along with Misato..."  
"明日香，我明白你和美里并不总是相处融洽……"

"What? I don't mean the slob, Idiot!"  
"什么？我不是说那个邋遢鬼，笨蛋！"

A sigh of relief rang out in response. "Then who do you mean?"  
随之传来一阵松了口气的叹息。“那你指的是谁？”

"The Bitch!" turning to face Shinji, Asuka clarified. Seeing that he still didn't understand, she rolled her eyes, "Tall bitch. Big tits. Glasses. Music club. What was her name? Hmm, something with M," putting her finger to lips she began to pick up the name, "Ma-..., Ma-... Ah, Mari! Bitch name, how could I forget." Completely satisfied with her wit Asuka smirked towards Shinji.  
"那个贱人！" 转身面对真嗣，明日香解释道。见他还是一头雾水，她翻了个白眼，"高个贱人。大胸。戴眼镜。音乐社的。她叫什么来着？嗯，名字里有个 M，" 她用手指抵着嘴唇，开始回忆那个名字，"Ma-..., Ma-... 啊，是玛丽！贱人名字，我怎么可能忘。" 对自己的机智感到十分满意的明日香向真嗣露出了得意的笑容。

"Mayumi," said completely disgruntled Shinji, "Mayumi Yamagishi is her name." Walking over to Asuka, Shinji stared meaningfully at the Christmas tree. "Actually, she invited me to the Christmas party." His eyebrows furrowed and his gaze dropped to the floor. "I responded I need to ask you," he said. "Are you with me?"  
"是山岸真由美，" 真嗣不悦地说道，"她的名字是山岸真由美。" 他走向明日香，意味深长地凝视着圣诞树。"其实，她邀请我参加圣诞派对。" 他的眉头紧锁，目光垂向地面。"我回复说需要征求你的意见，" 他说，"你愿意和我一起去吗？"

"Ha!" The expression on Asuka's face changed from pensive to triumphant instantly. "I'm with Hikari!" she poked her chest with her thumb.  
"哈！" 明日香的表情瞬间从沉思转为得意。"我和光在一起！" 她用拇指戳了戳自己的胸口。

"Oh..." retorted Shinji slightly dejectedly.  
"哦..." 真嗣有些沮丧地反驳道。

Asuka poked him in the side with her elbow, smirking. "And you're with me!"  
明日香用肘部轻轻戳了戳他的侧腹，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑。"而你跟我一起！"

Not a request, not a demand, but a statement of fact. Shinji bit his lip, hiding the smile and the blush on his cheeks. The blush on Asuka's cheeks was hidden by her hair and still pretended to be a blush from physical activity.  
这不是请求，也不是命令，而是一个事实陈述。真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，掩饰住嘴角的微笑和脸颊上的红晕。明日香脸上的红晕被头发遮住，还假装是因为运动而泛起的红晕。

"Cool," Shinji said. "酷," 真嗣说道。

"Cool!" "酷！"

"Cool." Shinji picked up the star that was still in Asuka's hands, trailing his fingers over hers. "What's wrong with using the chairs?"  
"酷。" 真嗣拾起阿苏卡手中依旧握着的星星，指尖轻触她的手背。"用椅子有什么问题吗？"

Asuka's smirk disappeared from her face. "Chairs are for wimps," she muttered.  
明日香的坏笑从脸上消失了。“椅子是给懦夫用的，”她嘟囔道。

"Hmm, you're right, wimps can't hold a penguin above them," Shinji confirmed understandingly. Without the slightest effort he reached out and set the star on top of the Christmas tree. "Also you were right about Misato, she's bar hopping with Kaji, Akagi and Ibuki tomorrow." Appreciating the now completely finished Christmas picture, he smiled. "You were right about the decorations too. It looks... wonderful. I couldn't have done that."  
“嗯，你说得对，懦夫可举不起企鹅，”真嗣理解地点头确认。他毫不费力地伸手将星星放在圣诞树顶端。“还有，你关于美里的事也说对了，她明天要和加持、赤木还有伊吹去酒吧跳跃。”欣赏着现在完全布置好的圣诞景象，他微笑着。“关于装饰你也说对了。看起来……太美了。我一个人肯定做不到。”

Turning around, Shinji headed for his room, completely unaware of the effect on his complex companion. "Good night, Asuka."  
转身后，真嗣朝自己的房间走去，完全没有意识到这对他复杂的同伴产生了什么影响。“晚安，明日香。”

Asuka said nothing. With the corners of her lips lowered and her eyes squinted, she continued to look up at the star from below, folding her arms in front of her. Only moments later she opened her mouth with a bitter tone on the tip of her tongue.  
明日香一言不发，嘴角下垂，眯着眼睛，继续从下方仰望那颗星星，双臂交叉在胸前。片刻后，她才开口，舌尖带着苦涩的语气。

"I'm always right." 我总是对的。

12 厘米红色厚底高跟鞋？确认。

Asuka made the final preparations. Armed to the teeth, she walked out of her room onto the battlefield. Her opponent was already waiting for her. And he wasn't about to lose either.  
明日香做完了最后的准备。全副武装的她走出房间，踏入战场。她的对手已经等在那里，而且他也绝不会轻易认输。

Shinji was standing in the hallway, his back leaning against the wall and staring dreamily at the ceiling. He was dressed stylishly. Dark brown shoes match with leather belt. Tapered navy blue trousers, accentuating his slender figure. A snow-white, not school shirt, fitted and tailored. The dark blue blazer fit perfectly over him. The carelessly knotted black tie combined with the unbuttoned top button of his shirt made Asuka's left eye twitch unhappily. Definitely Kaji's work.  
真嗣站在走廊里，背靠着墙，出神地望着天花板。他打扮得很时髦：深棕色皮鞋搭配同色皮带，紧身海军蓝长裤突显出他修长的身材，一件非校服的雪白衬衫剪裁合体，深蓝色西装外套完美贴合身形。随意打结的黑色领带加上衬衫最上面的扣子未扣，让明日香的左眼不悦地抽搐了一下。绝对是加持的杰作。

The clicks of her heels woke Shinji from his hovering in the clouds. When he turned his head towards her, Asuka knew immediately this was a battle she had won. She'd even say unequivocally, but her pulse quickened as she looked over her beau, telling her that she had suffered losses too.  
她高跟鞋的咔嗒声将真嗣从云端徘徊中唤醒。当他转头望向她时，明日香立刻明白这场战斗她已胜券在握。她甚至可以毫不犹豫地说出口，但当她审视着自己的心上人时，心跳加速，告诉她自己也并非毫发无损。

"You're not so bad," Asuka said smugly, getting right in front of Shinji. "The colour of your skin matches my nails perfectly, great choice," inspecting Shinji's expression, she teased, displaying her palm near his cheek.  
"你也没那么糟嘛，" 明日香得意地说着，凑到真嗣面前。"你的肤色和我的指甲油颜色简直绝配，选得不错，" 她一边审视着真嗣的表情，一边戏谑地将手掌靠近他的脸颊。

Shinji tried to play along, "You-you're okay too," Swallowing loudly, he looked down. "And you've also grown taller over the evening."  
真嗣试图顺着她的话说，"你、你也挺好的，" 他大声吞咽了一下，低头说道。"而且你晚上似乎也长高了。

Inspecting Shinji from her new height, she felt no expected surge of confidence. The innocuous remark only made her more nervous. But she was best at pretending.  
从新的身高审视着真嗣，她并没有感受到预期中的自信涌动。这句无害的评论反倒让她更加紧张。但她最擅长假装了。

"Yeah, don't think you're that special." Circling around him she warned, "I'll always be around to remind..." her voice changed almost to a whisper, making Shinji shiver.  
"是啊，别以为你有多特别。"她绕着他转圈，警告道，"我会一直在你身边提醒你……"她的声音几乎变成了耳语，让真嗣打了个寒颤。

A new wave of redness lit up his face as a hard flick to his ear stunned him.  
又一波红晕涌上他的脸颊，耳朵被重重地弹了一下，让他愣住了。

"...how I hate smartasses," her tone completely changed from playful to annoyed. "And no ties," hissed Asuka, tugging on a piece of clothing. A wicked clanking of heels rushed towards the front door. Asuka picked up her jacket and exited the flat.  
"……我有多讨厌自作聪明的人，"她的语气从调皮完全变成了恼怒。"还有，别系领带，"明日香低声说道，扯了扯一件衣服。一阵刺耳的高跟鞋声急促地朝前门冲去。明日香拿起外套，走出了公寓。

Shinji, coming to his senses, began to untie his tie in a hurry, terrified that Asuka would get too far away. "Hey, do you really need them?" he shouted through the open door, holding his jacket under his arm. His voice echoed down the landing. Closing the door to the flat, he felt someone else's answer echo as "What?" hit him in the back. He turned around, but saw only a glimpse of red hiding in the elevator.  
真嗣回过神来，急忙开始解开领带，生怕明日香走得太远。"嘿，你真的需要它们吗？"他对着敞开的门大声喊道，夹克夹在腋下。他的声音在楼梯间回荡。关上公寓的门，他感觉到另一个人的回答回响着，"什么？"这个词击中了他的后背。他转过身，却只瞥见电梯里一抹红色隐去。

A few flights of stairs and dropped calories later, Shinji was leaning on his knees, breathing heavily at the elevator doors on the ground floor and staring at the floor. The doors opened and he saw the subject of his question almost directly in front of his eyes.  
几段楼梯和消耗的卡路里之后，真嗣双手撑膝，气喘吁吁地站在一楼电梯门前，盯着地面。电梯门打开，他几乎立刻看到了他问题的焦点。

"Hi-...High...heels," Shinji forced his breath out.  
“嗨……高跟鞋，”真嗣勉强挤出声音。

"Of course I need them, you Idiot, I can't see you being barefoot," Asuka continued the conversation  
“我当然需要它们，你这个笨蛋，我总不能光着脚见你吧，”明日香继续说道

Shinji couldn't believe such reasons. "But... but we're walking to Hikari," he incredulously began to clarify, "Aren't we?"  
真嗣无法相信这样的理由。“但是……但是我们正走向光那里，”他难以置信地开始澄清，“不是吗？”

The wearer of the heels was still undeterred, "That's exactly why I'll be wearing them." The clacking resumed. "Now stop holding us both up and hurry up, we're long overdue."  
穿高跟鞋的人依旧不为所动，“这正是我要穿它们的原因。”脚步声再次响起。“现在别再耽误我们俩了，快点，我们早就迟到了。”

Shinji hurried. Shinji didn't bring up who was the real reason for the delay. His hurry had ended up not being able to change either the weather or the speed of his companion. The road was covered with ice and snow and, as it turned out, high heels were not the best choice for a walk in the winter season.  
真嗣加快了脚步。他没有提及是谁真正导致了延误。他的匆忙最终未能改变天气，也未能影响同伴的速度。道路被冰雪覆盖，事实证明，高跟鞋并非冬季散步的最佳选择。

Everything was repeating almost every minute.  
一切几乎每分钟都在重复。

"Wait!" And Shinji was waiting.  
"等等！" 于是真嗣便等待着。

"Slow down a little!" And Shinji was slowing down.  
"稍微慢一点！" 于是真嗣开始减速。

"Stop running away!" Shinji had stopped running away two years ago.  
"别再逃避了！" 真嗣两年前就已经停止逃避了。

Asuka resembled a geisha shod in geta with her speed and grace. Shinji dared not make such a comment. His audacity was only enough to take Asuka under his arm and drag her beside him like a disgruntled and willful cat on a leash. This did not help the situation. Shinji began to believe that they would not make it to Hikari and Toji today.  
明日香的速度与优雅宛如穿着木屐的艺伎。真嗣不敢对此发表评论。他的胆量仅够将明日香揽在臂弯，像牵着一只不满而任性的猫咪般拖拽着她前行。这并未改善局面。真嗣开始觉得，他们今天恐怕无法与光和东治相见了。

After an eternity of listening to the grunts beside him, Shinji's patience burst. "What's so important about these shoes?"  
在无尽的等待中，听着身旁的喘息声，真嗣的耐心终于爆发了。“这双鞋到底有什么重要的？”

"Everything," replied Asuka tiredly and angrily.  
"一切，" 明日香疲惫而愤怒地回答道。

An equally tired and angry Shinji only echoed her, "We have all the time in the world now, just try to explain!"  
同样疲惫而愤怒的碇真嗣只是重复她的话，"我们现在有的是时间，试着解释一下吧！"

Asuka's voice rose instantly, "I'm better only with them!" Trying to free herself from under the strong arm, Asuka stumbled backwards.  
明日香的声音立刻提高，"我只和他们在一起时更好！" 试图从那强有力的手臂下挣脱，明日香踉跄着后退。

Two thuds hit the cold ground. Two simultaneous painful moans. Shinji felt deja vu, opening his eyes and seeing Asuka lying directly beneath him. In any other moment, he would have been scared and pleased to be in this situation at the same time. But not now.  
两声闷响撞击在冰冷的地面上，紧接着是两声同时发出的痛苦呻吟。真嗣感到一种似曾相识的感觉，睁开眼睛，看到明日香正躺在自己身下。换作其他时刻，他或许会既害怕又高兴地处于这种境地，但此刻并非如此。

Quickly rising, he reached out a hand to help. Asuka brushed it off.  
迅速起身，他伸出手想要帮忙。明日香却将其推开。

"What you said, are you serious?"  
“你刚才说的，是认真的吗？”

The barefooted girl looked at the broken off red heel. "Yes," was her simple reply.  
赤脚的女孩望着断掉的红鞋跟，“是的，”她简单地回答。

Silence hung in the air. After a few moments Shinji broke it with a simple question, not even thinking of any irony, "Are you stupid?"  
寂静笼罩着四周。片刻后，真嗣打破了沉默，他甚至没有考虑其中的讽刺意味，直截了当地问道：“你是傻吗？”

"I'm not!" “我才不是！”

"Or were you just trying so hard to impress me-... people around you? Isn't this a real case of showing off now?"  
“还是说你只是太想给我——或者说给周围的人留下深刻印象？现在这不是明摆着在炫耀吗？”

"I-it's not like that!" Unable to endure such humiliation Asuka kicked both her heels into the driveway and staggered away from Shinji.  
"我-我不是那个意思！"无法忍受这样的羞辱，明日香猛地踢起脚后跟，踉跄着从真嗣身边逃离。

Realising that his annoyed even more than before friend could move much faster now, Shinji followed. Not a minute later, the loud clatter of teeth against each other announced the obvious - walking barefoot in winter is little better than walking in heels. The fabric of Asuka's tights looked drenched and the stares of passers-by looked judgmental.  
意识到朋友比以往更加烦躁，而且现在能走得更快，真嗣紧随其后。不出一分钟，牙齿相撞的响亮声响便宣告了一个显而易见的事实——冬天赤脚行走并不比穿高跟鞋好多少。明日香的长筒袜看起来湿透了，而路人的目光则显得颇为苛责。

Standing in front of the sullen and frozen girl, Shinji put his back up, leaned slightly and crouched down. The invitation was instantly accepted, but not without a sense of imitation reluctance. They continued their slow movement forward, completely oblivious to their original destination.  
站在那闷闷不乐、仿佛冻结的女孩面前，真嗣挺直了背，微微倾身并蹲下。邀请立刻被接受，却带着一种模仿的勉强。他们继续缓慢前行，完全忘记了原来的目的地。

Asuka was tired. She was tired of losing. All the significant battles had long since been lost, so she concentrated on the minor ones, turning them into something important in her mind. But even here failures awaited her. The sense of competitiveness would never disappear from her life, and the sense of insecurity that contradicted it did nothing to help. Confidence for such a mind and heart was hard to find.  
明日香累了。她厌倦了失败。所有重大的战斗早已一败涂地，于是她专注于小规模的战斗，在心中将其放大为重要之事。但即便在这里，失败也在等着她。竞争感永远不会从她的生活中消失，与之矛盾的不安全感也毫无助益。对于这样的心智和心灵来说，自信难以寻觅。

Sticking her cold nose against the area between Shinji's ear and the back of his head, she inhaled deeply. His cologne reminded her of something akin to a sea breeze. Something from their first meeting.  
她将冰冷的鼻尖贴在真嗣耳后与后脑之间的区域，深吸一口气。他的古龙水让她想起类似海风的味道。那是他们初次相遇时的记忆。

"It's stupid, but I don't want to be shorter than you," muttered the ashamed and frustrated girl.  
“这很蠢，但我不想比你矮，”羞愧而沮丧的女孩低声说道。

Shinji found nothing better than sarcasm in response to such a ridiculous statement, "Well, good luck. You've seen my father, haven't you?"  
面对如此荒谬的言论，真嗣觉得没有什么比讽刺更好的回应了，“好吧，祝你好运。你见过我父亲，不是吗？”

Asuka giggled, tickling Shinji's ear with it. " Screw you and your bastard father. All I want..."  
明日香咯咯地笑着，用这话挠了挠真嗣的耳朵。“去你的，还有你那混蛋父亲。我想要的只是……”

_"All I want for Christmas is you..."_ A car drove by with the speakers on loudly.  
“圣诞节我想要的只有你……”一辆车驶过，喇叭声震耳欲聋。

"I want to feel confident again. Being tall was cool," Asuka pretended to pout.  
“我想再次找回自信。长得高曾经很酷，”明日香假装噘嘴说道。

"I agree." Shinji couldn't help, but smile. "Being tall is cool, look at me."  
“我同意。” 真嗣忍不住笑了。“长得高很酷，看看我。”

"You know, I could bite your ear off right now to make us at least a little more equal," an already calm girl voiced the tempting suggestion .  
“你知道吗，我现在就能一口咬掉你的耳朵，好歹让我们稍微平等一点，”一个已经平静下来的女孩提出了这个诱人的建议。

Shinji noticed the entrance to a small shop on their path. The porch in front of the door was under an awning, protecting it from rain and snow. The snow was still here, but it was much better than the snowy and icy road.  
真嗣注意到他们路上有一家小店的入口。门前的门廊上方有遮阳篷，使其免受雨雪侵袭。虽然这里还有积雪，但比起那冰雪覆盖的道路要好得多。

"I have a better idea." Lowering an uncomprehending Asuka onto the concrete pavement, Shinji began to remove his shoes. A pair of expensive shoes flew into the trash bin. "See? Now we're equal." Smiling, Shinji was completely pleased with himself and his cleverness.  
“我有个更好的主意。”真嗣将一头雾水的明日香放在混凝土地面上，开始脱下自己的鞋子。一双昂贵的鞋子被扔进了垃圾桶。“看，现在我们平等了。”真嗣微笑着，对自己和他的机智感到完全满意。

Asuka was not impressed. She looked at him sideways and shook her head. "You're even dumber than I thought."  
明日香并不买账。她斜眼瞥了他一眼，摇了摇头。“你比我想象的还要蠢。”

The sounds of festive fireworks erupted outside. Different colours lit up the houses and the road, the number of people around increased. Laughter, shouts of joy and congratulations were heard from everywhere.  
窗外，节日的烟花声骤然响起。五彩斑斓的光芒照亮了房屋与道路，周围的人群也逐渐增多。欢笑声、喜悦的呼喊和祝福声此起彼伏。

Asuka caught Shinji's strange look on her face. "Hey, Asuka. I'm bored," she heard afterwards.  
明日香察觉到真嗣投来的异样目光。"嘿，明日香。我好无聊，"她随后听到他说。

Oh, no. 哦，不好。

"Well, I don't know, I don't think it's boring here at all right now," she pretended not to understand anything. No way in life was she planning on falling for her own ruse. It shouldn't be that easy. "I won't kiss you," she added, blushing hopefully.  
"嗯，我不知道，我现在一点也不觉得这里无聊，"她装作什么都不懂。生活中她可没打算上当。不应该那么容易。"我不会吻你的，"她补充道，脸上带着希望的红晕。

"Are you scared?" The stupid grin never left Shinji's face. "Or are you..."  
"你害怕了吗？" 真嗣脸上的傻笑从未消失。"还是你……"

Asuka stopped trying to play along. She quickly walked up close to Shinji and pointed her index finger at his chest. "I swear to God, if you say anything about my moth-..".  
明日香不再试图配合。她迅速走近真嗣，用食指指着他的胸口。"我向上帝发誓，如果你敢提我妈妈……"

"Or are you embarrassed you're too short for me?" He looked down at her, waiting for an answer.  
"还是说，你是因为对我来说太矮了而感到尴尬？" 他低头看着她，等待着回答。

She looked up at him, intent on giving an answer in the only way possible. The corners of her lips lifted, and Shinji didn't notice her eyes flashing dangerously.  
她抬头望向他，决心以唯一可能的方式给出回答。她的嘴角微微上扬，而真嗣并未察觉到她眼中闪过的危险光芒。

Asuka Langley Soryu stomped on Shinji Ikari's feet with all her greatness.  
明日香·兰格雷以其非凡的气势狠狠地踩在了碇真嗣的脚上。

Shinji instinctively jerked his upper body towards the source of the pain, closing his eyes and trying to suppress a scream. Halfway through, his lips met the other's, and his face was gripped tenaciously in a deadly grip.  
真嗣本能地向疼痛来源处猛地一缩上身，闭上眼睛试图压抑住尖叫。半途中，他的嘴唇触碰到了对方的，而他的脸庞则被紧紧地钳制在一个致命的抓握中。

Asuka smiled through the kiss. And in something for the moment she was confident enough.  
明日香在亲吻中微笑着。那一刻，她感到无比自信。

Shinji was smiling back too.  
真嗣也回以微笑。

_Author's Notes: 作者的话：_

_This is the story I wrote for the Winter Contest of AsuShin discord server. It was the first time I had ever written fiction in English, and I think it's visible. It was a funny and enjoyable process overall, even though I hated my own concept during this.  
这是为 AsuShin discord 服务器的冬季比赛所写的故事。这是我第一次用英语写小说，我想这一点很明显。尽管我对自己的构思感到厌恶，但整个过程还是既有趣又愉快。_

_I guess it's a little bit frustrating to struggle with writing at the start and then finding the story overbloated with too much content and you are incapable of delivering proper build up, explanation and especially the ending to the story. The funny silly idea transformed into just a silly idea, and a lot of things have been removed, because I needed only 5k words at most, not 10-20k. I've decided to keep the story almost untouched for the publishing here, because otherwise it would be unfair for readers' perception.  
一开始在写作上挣扎，然后发现故事内容过于臃肿，无法妥善构建、解释，尤其是无法给出一个合适的结局，这确实有点令人沮丧。那个有趣而愚蠢的想法变成了单纯的愚蠢想法，很多内容都被删除了，因为我最多只需要 5000 字，而不是 10000 到 20000 字。我决定在发布时保持故事几乎不变，否则对读者的感知来说就不公平了。_

_I must say thank you to all the people who have rated my story so high, because I was surprised with my position (8th out of 17 participants). I'm even a little bit proud.  
我必须向所有给予我的故事如此高评价的人表示感谢，因为我对自己在 17 位参与者中排名第 8 感到惊讶。我甚至感到有些自豪。_

_Thanks to AsuShin discord server in general, it is probably my favourite place on the Internet nowadays. If you're already joined, then you're cool, love you. If not, then join us, we're awesome (sometimes) and a little bit insane (most of the times). Check other participants' stories - we have great writers in our part of the fandom.  
多亏了 AsuShin discord 服务器，它现在大概是我最爱的网络空间。如果你已经加入，那你很酷，爱你哦。如果还没，那就加入我们吧，我们超棒（偶尔）且有点疯狂（大多数时候）。去看看其他参与者的故事——我们这个粉丝圈里有很多优秀的作家。_

_P.S._

_Gum commercial in the story is actually the biggest plot twist. It's not Japanese, but Indian commercial. Check it on YouTube - "Mentos Chewing Gum - Full Fresh". Or don't, I don't care.  
故事中的口香糖广告竟是最大的剧情反转。它并非来自日本，而是印度广告。在 YouTube 上搜索“Mentos Chewing Gum - Full Fresh”即可查看。或者不看也罢，我无所谓。_
