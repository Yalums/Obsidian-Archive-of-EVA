**January 11****th** **2021**  2021 年 1 月 11 日

**Tokyo 3 Outskirts - Early Morning  
第三新东京市郊外 - 清晨**

There is a bright flash of light and I suddenly become aware of my surroundings. I'm underwater, swimming in a dark red liquid. I feel panic within me as I hold my breath and swim towards the surface as quick as I can. My limbs feel as if they're on fire as I finally reach the surface of the water and gasp for air.  
一道耀眼的光芒闪过，我突然意识到自己身处的环境。我在水下，游动在一片暗红色的液体中。我感到一阵恐慌，屏住呼吸，尽可能快地向水面游去。我的四肢仿佛在燃烧，当我终于到达水面时，我大口喘息着。

I float on the surface for a few moments taking in my surroundings. Off in the distance I see the land, without hesitating I start to swim towards it as fast as my aching body will take me. As I move a sickening smell infiltrates my nostrils, my mind registers what this foul copper-like smell is.  
我在水面上漂浮了一会儿，观察四周。远处我看到了陆地，毫不犹豫地开始向它游去，尽我疼痛的身体所能达到的最快速度。随着我的移动，一股令人作呕的气味侵入我的鼻孔，我的脑海中浮现出这股恶臭的铜质气味的来源。

Blood... Am I swimming in blood? I try not to think about it. Survival and getting out of this liquid is the priority. I move forward and my mind informs me that swimming has never been one of my strengths. It was something I was capable of but never enjoyed or excelled at. Fortunately, that doesn't seem to matter as I reach the land.  
血...我是在血中游泳吗？我尽量不去想这件事。生存和逃离这片液体是首要任务。我继续前进，我的意识告诉我，游泳从来不是我的强项。虽然我能做到，但从未喜欢过或擅长过。幸运的是，这似乎并不重要，因为我最终到达了陆地。

I'm thankful for the sensation of the soft sand beneath my naked feet as I take a few slow and careful steps out of the water. Every part of my body hurts and I again find myself thankful for the sand being there to cushion me as I fall forward. Some of it flies up into my face and mouth, I try to spit it out before rolling onto my back and simply lying there for a few moments to catch my breath.  
我感激地感受着赤脚踏在柔软沙地上的触感，缓缓而小心翼翼地走出水面。全身每一处都在疼痛，再次庆幸有沙子作为缓冲，当我向前跌倒时。一些沙粒飞溅到我的脸上和嘴里，我试图吐出它们，然后翻过身来，只是躺在那里片刻，喘口气。

I can now feel the water lapping at my bare feet and the hems of my trousers. I can still smell the blood-like smell of the liquid and in my weakened state I prop myself up onto my elbows and try to shift away from the liquid. Above me the sky is a brilliant blue, the sun shining down on me and there is a gentle but cool breeze in the air.  
现在我能感觉到水轻拍着我赤裸的双脚和裤脚。我仍能闻到那液体类似血的气味，在我虚弱的状态下，我用手肘撑起自己，试图远离那液体。头顶上的天空是明亮的蓝色，阳光照耀着我，空气中有一股轻柔而凉爽的微风。

I look down at myself. I'm barefoot and wearing a pair of black trousers, this is accompanied by a white button-up shirt that is currently open revealing a tattered orange t-shirt. I look up from myself to the rest of my surroundings. Ahead of me I see the pool I emerged from, it's an incredibly large body of water coloured a deep blood red. The smell of it makes me feel sick but I can see that it is not blood as I feared.  
我低头看着自己。我赤着脚，穿着一条黑色裤子，搭配着一件敞开的白色扣衫，露出了破烂的橙色 T 恤。我从自己身上抬起目光，环顾四周。在我前方，我看到了我刚从那里出来的水池，它是一个巨大无比的水体，呈现出深血红色。它的气味让我感到恶心，但我能看出那并不是我担心的血液。

I look around and some additional monuments catch my eye. I feel rising out of the water a number of large strange statues. They're posed in cross like forms, their arms stretching out wide. I shudder at the sight of them. There is something eerily familiar about them, something familiar and terrifying. I dislike this feeling and turn my head away not wishing to see them any longer.  
我环顾四周，一些额外的纪念碑吸引了我的目光。我感觉到从水中升起了许多巨大而奇异的雕像。它们以十字形姿态排列，双臂向外伸展。看到它们，我不禁打了个寒颤。这些雕像有种诡异的熟悉感，既熟悉又可怕。我不喜欢这种感觉，于是转过头去，不再想看到它们。

'Where am I?' I ask myself as I take another look around, trying to avoid looking at the statues. As I look around I see other things that catch my eye and seem so familiar to me. I see the remains of buildings sticking up out of the water and I wonder exactly what happened here. What cause all of this to happen and why am I here now?  
'我在哪里？' 我自问，再次环顾四周，试图避开那些雕像。当我四处张望时，我看到了其他吸引我眼球的东西，它们对我来说似乎非常熟悉。我看到水面上矗立着的建筑残骸，不禁好奇这里究竟发生了什么。是什么导致了这一切的发生，而我此刻又为何会在这里？

I try to cast my mind back to what happened before I emerged from that pool. I try to remember what happened to me before that bright flash of light. It's at this moment I feel my stomach drop and little pangs of panic rise up inside me.  
我试图回想起从那个水池中出现之前发生的事情。我努力回忆在那道耀眼的光芒之前我经历了什么。就在这时，我感到胃部一阵下沉，内心涌起了些许恐慌的刺痛。

I... I can't remember. I can't... remember anything before that flash of light. I don't know what happened before it, I don't know... I don't know who I am!  
我...我记不起来了。在那道闪光之前的一切...我都...想不起来。我不知道闪光之前发生了什么，我不知道...我不知道自己是谁！

"Who am I?" “我是谁？”

I speak the words aloud hoping that maybe hearing the sound of my own voice might trigger something inside of me.  
我大声说出这些话，希望也许听到自己的声音能在我内心触发些什么。

It doesn't. Instead I feel more pangs of panic inside my stomach and I feel sicker than before. I don't know who I am! I don't know my name, where I came from, why I'm here or anything. No matter how much I try to remember, I'm just drawing a blank.  
它没有。相反，我感到胃里一阵阵恐慌的刺痛，比之前更加恶心。我不知道自己是谁！我不知道我的名字，我从哪里来，为什么在这里，或者任何事情。无论我怎么努力回忆，脑子里只是一片空白。

I get myself onto my knees and crawl forward towards the water. Pain shoots through my body with each movement but I try to shrug it off. I can't stop... I... I have to know.  
我让自己跪起来，向前爬向水边。每一次移动都让身体疼痛不已，但我试图忽视它。我不能停下来...我...我必须要知道。

"Who... Who Am I?" “我...我是谁？”

I say the words again as I get closer to the water. I look down at it hoping to see some sort of reflection. Some sort of clue as to who I am but the water is too dark to reflect anything for me to see.  
我再次说出这些话，当我走近水边。我低头望向水面，希望能看到某种倒影。希望能找到关于我是谁的线索，但水太黑了，什么也映不出来。

"Who am I!" “我是谁！”

I ask again as I bring my hand down into the water in frustration. I feel the droplets splash up onto my face.  
我再次问道，同时沮丧地将手伸入水中。我感觉到水滴溅到脸上。

"Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?"  
"我是谁？我是谁？我是谁？"

I keep asking and with each time I ask I bring a hand down into the water. I'm vaguely aware of a sound from behind me but I don't care to turn around and see what it is. All that matters to me is trying to find an answer to who I am. I dislike this. I hate this. I'm terrified of this. I need to know. I need to know!  
我不断追问，每一次提问，我都将手浸入水中。我隐约听到身后有声响，但我无意转身去看。对我来说，最重要的是试图找到我是谁的答案。我不喜欢这样。我讨厌这样。我对此感到恐惧。我需要知道。我需要知道！

"Who! Am! I!" "谁！是！我！"

I ask again as both hands come down, more water splashed up onto me as I hear another sound. It sounds like something slamming and moments later it's accompanied by the sound of footsteps. I don't turn around, I find myself frozen with fear as I wait for them to approach. The sound stops and I hear a voice, that of a young woman.  
我再次问道，双手落下时，更多的水溅到了我身上，同时我听到了另一种声音。那声音像是有什么东西猛地撞击，片刻后伴随着脚步声。我没有转身，发现自己因恐惧而僵住，等待着他们靠近。声音停止了，我听到了一个年轻女子的声音。

"Go and contact headquarters, tell them they were right and we have another survivor. Get them to prepare one of the rooms. I'll deal with this."  
“去联系总部，告诉他们我们猜对了，还有另一个幸存者。让他们准备一个房间。我来处理这里。”

I still don't turn around but I'm fairly sure one of the others has turned and went away. I remain still as I hear the woman start to walk towards me. She stops a metre or two away from me and I slowly turn myself around.  
我依然没有转身，但我相当确定其中一人已经转身离开。我保持静止，听着那女子开始向我走来。她在离我一两米远的地方停下，我慢慢地转过身来。

She is looking at me somewhat cautiously, perhaps the way someone might approach an animal they were unsure of. She kneels slowly and I take the time to look at her properly. She is a young woman with long brown hair done up in a ponytail. She is wearing a uniform that I don't recognize. Her expression seems warm and friendly but also cautious.  
她正有些谨慎地看着我，或许就像人们接近一只不确定的动物时的那种方式。她慢慢地跪下，我趁机仔细打量她。她是一位年轻女子，长长的棕色头发扎成马尾。她穿着一套我不认识的制服。她的表情显得温暖而友好，但也带着谨慎。

"Don't be afraid. We're here to help you." She finally says in a warm tone.  
“别害怕。我们是来帮你的。”她终于用温暖的语气说道。

"Who... Who am I?" I ask weakly, "I... I don't... I don't remember... anything."  
“我...我是谁？”我虚弱地问道，“我...我不...我不记得...任何事情。”

She takes a few steps forward and kneels down in front of me. She places a warm hand on my shoulder and rubs gently, "It'll be alright, it's a side effect of the emergence. In time you'll be fine, we're going to take you back to a safe place. Is that alright?"  
她向前走了几步，跪在我面前。她将温暖的手放在我的肩上，轻轻揉搓，“一切都会好起来的，这是觉醒的副作用。过段时间你就会没事的，我们会带你去一个安全的地方。这样可以吗？”

I nod weakly at her. I don't know what she means by emergence but I feel like I can trust her.  
我虚弱地点了点头。我不知道她所说的觉醒是什么意思，但我感觉可以信任她。

"Good. Can you stand?" “很好。你能站起来吗？”

I nod again, "I-I think so."  
我再次点头，“我——我想是的。”

She gets to her feet and extends a hand towards me. I reach out and take it and she helps me to my feet. My body still aches and I stumble forward slightly but she is there to catch me. She puts my arm around her shoulders and helps guide me towards a waiting vehicle and her colleague. I remain silent as I'm helped into the back of the vehicle as she takes a radio from him.  
她站起身来，向我伸出手。我伸出手握住，她扶我站起来。我的身体依然疼痛，微微踉跄了一下，但她及时扶住了我。她把我的手臂搭在她的肩膀上，引导我走向一辆等待的车辆和她的一位同事。我默默地被扶进车后座，她则从他那里接过一个无线电。

"Team 2-A reporting in, I have one survivor. Male, late teens and showing some signs of emergence sickness. Will need a doctor on standby for when we return."  
“2-A 小队报告，我这里有一名幸存者。男性，十几岁，表现出一些觉醒病症的迹象。返回时需要医生待命。”

I hear the voice on the other side come through clearly, _"A survivor? Been quite a while since the last one. We've got a room ready as we speak and I'll let the medical team know to be on standby. Anything else to report?"_  
我清晰地听到电话那头传来的声音，“幸存者？距离上一个已经很久了。我们这边已经准备好了房间，我会通知医疗团队随时待命。还有什么要报告的吗？”

"Nothing, it's all quiet out here. Will see you shortly."  
“没有，这里一切都很安静。我们很快见。”

The two of them climb into the vehicle properly and close the door. I look around and bring the belt around me and clip it in. It's strange that I can't remember who I am but I know to do this. As the car moves away I begin to wonder who these people are and what this emergence sickness was they mentioned.  
他们两人正式上了车并关上门。我环顾四周，拉过安全带扣好。奇怪的是，我不记得自己是谁，但我知道该这么做。随着车子驶离，我开始思考这些人是谁，以及他们提到的这种突发疾病是什么。

After a minute or so the man in the car turns himself around, he is about the same age as the girl.  
大约一分钟后，车里的男人转过身来，他和女孩年纪相仿。

"Our facility is only about ten minutes away from here." He tells me, "You know, you're the first person we've seen emerge in quite some time. We thought that all who were going to return had already returned by now."  
“我们的设施离这儿只有大约十分钟的路程。”他告诉我，“你知道吗，你是我们很久以来见到的第一个出现的人。我们以为所有要回来的人都已经回来了。”

I look at him in confusion not really knowing what he is talking about. All I can do is nod my head and immediately he seems to recognize my confusion.  
我困惑地看着他，不太明白他在说什么。我只能点点头，他似乎立刻察觉到了我的困惑。

"Sorry, I guess you probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about do you?"  
"抱歉，我猜你可能完全不知道我在说什么，对吧？"

I shake my head, "I am sorry."  
我摇摇头，"我很抱歉。"

"No need to apologize." He says to me, "it's the emergence sickness. It affects most of us when we come out. Tend to draw a complete blank as to who we are and what happened before. It'll pass tough, it always does!"  
"无需道歉。" 他对我說，"这是出现症状。我们大多数人出来时都会受到影响。往往会完全忘记自己是谁以及之前发生了什么。不过它会过去的，总是如此！"

I feel somewhat reassured by his words but that little feeling of dread is still hanging there. I resist the urge to ask questions like, 'what if it doesn't?'  
他的话让我稍感安心，但那股隐隐的恐惧感依旧挥之不去。我强忍着不去问那些问题，比如，'如果它不呢？'

"So is there anything you do remember?"  
“那你记得些什么吗？”

"No... nothing." I tell him.  
“不……什么也不记得。”我告诉他。

"Well try to not worry about it!" He reassures me again, "Few days rest and everything will work out fine."  
“尽量别担心！”他又安慰我，“休息几天，一切都会好起来的。”

**UN Emergence Support Facility – Late Evening  
联合国紧急支援设施 – 深夜**

I look into the bathroom mirror and once again try to recall just who it is I am. I can feel the frustration beginning to set in for me. It's been this way for three quarters of an hour and I've come no closer to remembering who I am than I was this morning.  
我望向浴室镜子，再次试图回忆我是谁。我能感觉到挫败感开始涌上心头。这种情况已经持续了四十五分钟，而我对自己身份的记忆并不比今早更清晰。

I know that they said this would only be temporary but I want to know, I need to know. I don't want to just sit there and wait. I want to try and do everything I can to remember. I want to remember as soon as I can but as I look in this mirror all I see is the reflection of someone I don't know. I see eyes that I've never seen before, I see an expression I don't know and I'm scared. What if I can't remember?  
我知道他们说这只是暂时的，但我想要知道，我需要知道。我不想只是坐在那里等待。我想尽我所能去尝试回忆。我希望尽快记起来，但当我看着镜子时，我看到的却是一个我不认识的人。我看到了从未见过的眼睛，看到了一个我不熟悉的表情，我感到害怕。如果我无法记起来怎么办？

I had the chance to find out some things about what had happened. I found out that five years ago there was a cataclysmic event that threatened the world. It was an event known as the Third Impact, it had ultimately been stopped but a large number of people had vanished as a result of it. Many of those people had since returned, they had emerged from the very same body of water that I emerged from.  
我有机会了解了一些关于发生过的事情。我得知五年前发生了一场威胁世界的灾难性事件。那次事件被称为第三次冲击，最终被阻止了，但因此有大量的人消失了。许多人在那之后陆续返回，他们正是从我出现的那片水域中出现的。

They also explained the 'Emergence Sickness' phenomenon to me too. A number of returnees had suffered from a loss of memory similar to what I have done. All of these people would recover their members in time, some of them in a few hours and others would take a few days. They had no process for helping this happen, it was said that it would just happen in time.  
他们还向我解释了‘出现症候群’现象。许多返回者经历了与我类似的记忆丧失。这些人最终都会逐渐恢复记忆，有些人只需几小时，而有些人则需要几天。他们没有帮助这一过程的方法，据说记忆会在时间中自然恢复。

All I have to do is wait. All I have to do is wait and feel this frustration within me knowing I could do nothing about it. All I can do is wait and feel fear at the thought that I might be the first who doesn't recover my memory. What if I go the rest of my life not knowing who I truly am?  
我唯一能做的就是等待。我只能忍受内心的挫败感，明知无能为力。我只能等待，一想到可能成为第一个无法恢复记忆的人，恐惧便油然而生。如果我余生都无法知晓自己真正的身份，那该怎么办？

No! I will recover them, I can… I can feel them somewhere inside of me. I know they're there, as I listened to those people today I would hear certain words and phrases that would trigger certain feelings or emotions inside of me. I must be close to remembering but it is almost as if my memories are locked behind some giant door and I need to find the key.  
不！我会找回它们的，我能……我能感觉到它们在我内心某处。我知道它们就在那里，今天听那些人说话时，某些词句会触发我内心的某些感觉或情绪。我一定快要想起来了，但记忆仿佛被一扇巨大的门锁住，我需要找到那把钥匙。

I look once again at my own reflection and I observe just how peculiar I look compared to the others here. No one mentioned anything but upon seeing my own face for the first time I can see the striking differences between myself and them. It is like I am some sort of alien amongst them. I fix my gaze at the unknown face, stare deep into the red eyes, run my hand through my grey hair and observe my pale skin.  
我再次凝视自己的倒影，观察到自己与这里的人相比是多么奇特。虽然没人提起，但第一次看到自己的脸时，我就能明显看出与他们的差异。我仿佛是他们中的异类。我凝视着这张陌生的脸，深深地注视着那双红眼睛，抚摸着灰色的头发，观察着苍白的皮肤。

Perhaps… Perhaps it would be best if I took their advice and go to sleep. Maybe in the morning I will remember. I look towards the other room and I can feel tiredness throughout my body. I will sleep, tomorrow may bring the answers I seek.  
或许……或许听从他们的建议去睡觉是最好的选择。也许到了早晨我会记起来。我望向另一个房间，感到全身疲惫。我会睡去，明天或许会带来我寻求的答案。

**January 12****th** **- Early Morning**  
1 月 12 日 - 清晨

I remember! I remember! I remember!  
我想起来了！我想起来了！我想起来了！

I awake suddenly from my restless slumber, I can feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest and I feel the sheets cling to my sweat covered body. Tears sting my eyes as I lay on my side with my eyes wide open staring at the wall.  
我从不安稳的睡眠中猛然惊醒，能感觉到心脏在胸腔内急速跳动，汗水浸湿的身体让床单紧贴。泪水刺痛了我的双眼，我侧躺着，眼睛睁得大大的，凝视着墙壁。

I know who I am! I know what I am and… I know that I should not… I should not be here.  
我知道我是谁！我知道我是什么，而且……我知道我不应该……我不应该在这里。

As I lay on my side not daring to move my nightmare replays itself in my head. I have never dreamed before. I was… I was incapable of such things, I thought I was incapable of such things and yet I have experienced that very such thing right now. The dream was of those final moments, my taking of Evangelion Unit 02, that long trip down to Central Dogma, my conversation with Shinji and my sacrifice.  
我侧躺着，不敢动弹，噩梦在脑海中重演。我从未做过梦。我……我以为自己无法做梦，然而此刻我却经历了那样的梦境。那梦是关于那些最后的时刻，我驾驶初号机，那漫长的旅程前往中央教条区，与真嗣的对话，以及我的牺牲。

I have very little time to dwell on this as I'm suddenly hit with another new and unpleasant sensation. A sharp pain is felt in my stomach and I feel an odd queasiness and dizziness in my head. I lie still for a moment hoping it will go away before the pain turns to a burning sensation. In that moment my instincts kick in and I leap out of the bed.  
我几乎没有时间深思这个问题，因为突然间我又被一种新的、令人不快的感觉击中。腹部传来一阵剧痛，头部感到一种奇怪的恶心和眩晕。我静静地躺了一会儿，希望这疼痛会消失，但随后疼痛转为灼热感。那一刻，我的本能驱使我跳下床。

I sprint into the bathroom just in time for the feeling to completely overwhelm me. I collapse to my knees both of them hitting the tiled floor roughly and painfully. I feel more pain throughout me as I retch and throw up violently into the toilet bowl.  
我冲进浴室，正好赶上这种感觉完全压倒我。我双膝跪地，重重地摔在瓷砖地板上，疼痛难忍。我全身感到更多的疼痛，剧烈地呕吐，将胃里的东西全部吐进了马桶。

With my stomach emptied I remain still for a moment and let out a soft whimper as more tears run down my cheek. My stomach and chest hurt so much, my knees hurt from collapsing onto them. I weakly reach for a piece of toilet tissue and wipe my mouth before flushing the contents of the toilet.  
胃里清空后，我静静地待了一会儿，轻声呜咽，泪水顺着脸颊流下。我的胃和胸部疼痛难忍，膝盖也因为跪倒而疼痛。我无力地伸手拿了一张卫生纸，擦了擦嘴，然后冲掉了马桶里的内容物。

I let out another soft whimper. I remember everything now. I remember it all so clearly. I daren't move from my position in the cold bathroom. Instead I bring my knees up to my naked chest and wrap my arms around them.  
我又发出一声轻轻的呜咽。现在我全记起来了。一切都那么清晰。我不敢从冰冷的浴室里挪动位置。相反，我将自己的膝盖抱到赤裸的胸前，双臂环绕着它们。

All of those memories were rushing through my head now. I can remember it all. I can remember NERV, SEELE, my own birth and the man who raised me. I can remember Shinji with his sweet smile and innocence. I can remember his eyes when I betrayed him. I can… remember it all now and contrary to my previous wishes I wish I could forget it again.  
所有这些记忆此刻正涌入我的脑海。我全都能记起来。我记得 NERV，SEELE，我自己的诞生和抚养我的人。我记得真嗣那甜美的微笑和纯真。我记得我背叛他时他的眼神。我……现在全都能记起来，与之前的愿望相反，我真希望自己能再次忘却这一切。

I am Kaworu Nagisa… I was the last Angel mankind had to face. I should not be alive. These thoughts continue to cycle through my mind as I hug my knees tightly and my soft whimpers turn to loud sobs. I fear sleep will not find me again tonight as I sit sobbing on the hard bathroom floor.  
我是渚薰……我是人类必须面对的最后一个使徒。我不应该活着。这些念头不断在我脑海中循环，我紧紧抱着膝盖，轻声的呜咽变成了大声的哭泣。我害怕今晚无法再次入睡，坐在坚硬的浴室地板上哭泣。

**January 19****th** **– Morning** 1 月 19 日 —— 清晨

One week has passed since I emerged from the sea of souls as I have come to understand it. One week since I was somehow given a second chance at life. One whole week of nights filled with nightmares and days filled with the fear of others. I've spent each day since I recalled who I was living in fear that I will be hurt. I've spent each night terrified of going to sleep knowing that only nightmares will await me.  
自从我理解了自己是如何从灵魂之海中浮现出来，已经过去了一周。自从我不知怎么地得到了第二次生命的机会，已经整整一周了。这一周里，夜晚充斥着噩梦，白天则充满了对他人的恐惧。自从我记起自己是谁以来，每一天我都在害怕会受到伤害。每一个夜晚，我都害怕入睡，因为我知道等待我的只有噩梦。

It is something of a cruel irony, in my past life I had always wondered what it must be like to dream. I was almost envious of those Lilim who did so. I always wondered what sort of dreams I would have and wished that I were able to. Now I just wish I could be like that again. The reality is far more terrifying than the fantasy.  
这是一种残酷的讽刺，在我过去的生活中，我总是想知道做梦是什么感觉。我几乎羡慕那些会做梦的莉莉姆。我总是想知道我会做什么样的梦，并希望自己也能做梦。现在，我只希望能回到那种状态。现实远比幻想更可怕。

Yet dreams were just one thing I have had to get used to over this past week. I have been examined by this facilities medical staff, spoken to the people who brought me in and it seems I am now completely human. I am no longer an Angel, I am one of them.  
然而，梦境只是过去这一周我不得不适应的众多事物之一。我接受了这里医疗人员的检查，与带我来此的人交谈，似乎我现在已经完全变成了人类。我不再是天使，而是他们中的一员。

It is a feeling that is both liberating to me and terrifying at the same time. I find myself no longer plagued by the crippling loneliness I used to feel in that form, I also find myself no longer plagued by the call of Adam or Lilith. I am no longer able to sense the A.T. Fields of every being around me but I am also no longer able to protect myself with my own A.T. Field should the need arise.  
这种感觉对我来说既是解放，又同时令人恐惧。我发现不再被那种形态下的极度孤独所困扰，也不再受到亚当或莉莉丝的召唤所困扰。我不再能感知周围每一个存在的 A.T.力场，但同样，如果需要，我也无法再用自己的 A.T.力场来保护自己。

I have found myself struggling with the array of emotions within me. When I was an Angel I felt emotions but they were always dulled by other parts that made up myself. I perhaps did not feel them nor could I express them quite as a human would. Yet now I am feeling these things, I am feeling fear and sadness properly for the first time, it is somewhat overwhelming to get used to.  
我发现自己在应对内心复杂的情感时感到挣扎。作为天使时，我也有情感，但它们总是被构成我自身的其他部分所淡化。我或许没有感受到它们，也无法像人类那样表达它们。但现在我感受到了这些情感，我第一次真正感受到了恐惧和悲伤，这有些让人难以适应。

Again I used to wonder what it'd be like to feel those unchained emotions. To be able to express myself properly and experience what humans feel. They were always fascinating beings to me, I was always told I was above them, better than them and yet in many ways I longed to be one of them. I wondered what made me above them, what made me better than them? I know the truth now, I was not above them or better than them, I was simply different but… I have realized this truth much too late.  
曾经，我常常好奇那种无拘无束的情感体验会是什么样子。能够自如地表达自己，感受人类所经历的一切。他们对我来说总是充满魅力，我常被告知自己凌驾于他们之上，比他们更优秀，然而在很多方面，我却渴望成为他们中的一员。我曾疑惑，是什么让我凌驾于他们之上，又是什么让我比他们更优秀？如今我明白了真相，我并非凌驾于他们之上，也并非比他们更优秀，我只是与众不同……但遗憾的是，我领悟这个真相太迟了。

In speaking to me I have been assured by the people who brought me in that I am safe. That they do know who I was and what I was and that no harm will come to me. That I am to be treated the same as anyone else who has been through this process has been. It is a small comfort to me, a person who was brought up being told constantly about the negative side of humanity.  
在与我交谈中，那些将我带来的人向我保证，我是安全的。他们知道我的过去和我的身份，不会让我受到伤害。我将被同等对待，就像经历过这个过程的其他人一样。对于一个从小被不断灌输人性负面的人来说，这算是一点小小的慰藉。

As I lie in my bed my thoughts turn once again to the person who I hurt all those years ago. I wonder if these feelings of fear I have now are what he used to feel. Did you feel fear like this Shinji? Did you feel it each time before you piloted the Eva? Did you feel it before you went to school? Was this fear inside me the same as the crippling fear inside of you?  
当我躺在床上，思绪再次飘向多年前我伤害的那个人。我在想，我现在感受到的恐惧是否就是他曾经感受到的。真嗣，你曾感到过这样的恐惧吗？每次驾驶 Eva 之前，你是否都感到过这种恐惧？上学前呢？我内心的这种恐惧，是否与你那令人瘫痪的恐惧相同？

I sit myself up and look around my quarters. They are somewhat barren but larger and more homely than what I was used to in the past. In one corner is a wardrobe with a chest of drawers next to it that I am used to store the clothing I've been given by the facility staff.  
我坐起身来，环顾我的房间。虽然有些空旷，但比过去习惯的环境要大得多，也温馨得多。在一个角落里，有一个衣柜，旁边是一个抽屉柜，我习惯将设施工作人员给我的衣服存放在那里。

In an opposite corner is a small kitchen where I am able to make myself small meals and tea. The centre of the room has a small sofa with a television set up in front of it. I grab the remote control and turn the television on. Immediately I'm greeted by two hosts on some morning talk show, they seem to be discussing a news report about a recent raid on what was suspected to be a SEELE facility.  
在对角是一个小厨房，我可以在那里为自己准备简单的饭菜和茶。房间中央有一张小沙发，前面摆放着一台电视机。我拿起遥控器，打开电视。立刻，我被某个早间谈话节目的两位主持人迎接，他们似乎正在讨论一则关于最近突袭疑似 SEELE 设施的新闻报道。

I quickly change the channel not wishing to hear anything related to that organization now or in the near future. Instead I settle on some kids cartoon and leave it on in the background as I start to get changed. I get halfway through putting my trousers on before I hear a faint knock at the door.  
我迅速换了个频道，不想听到任何与那个组织现在或近期有关的消息。转而选择了一部儿童卡通片，让它在背景中播放，我开始换衣服。裤子穿到一半时，我听到了一阵轻微的敲门声。

"Just a moment." I call out to whoever it is and finish putting on the rest of my clothes. I button up my shirt and wander over to the door. Opening it reveals Kodama Horaki, the woman who found me on the beach a week ago.  
“稍等一下。”我朝门外的人喊道，并迅速穿好剩下的衣服。扣好衬衫，我漫步到门口。打开门，眼前是 Kodama Horaki，一周前在海滩上发现我的那位女士。

"Mr Nagisa." She addresses me in a formal manner, one that makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. I've never really understood formal greetings as far as humans go but it is not my lack of understanding that provides discomfort. It is that it reminds me of my first meeting with Shinji Ikari.  
“Nagisa 先生。”她以一种正式的方式称呼我，这让我感到有些不自在。我从未真正理解过人类的正式问候，但让我不舒服的并非缺乏理解。而是这种称呼让我想起了与 Shinji Ikari 的初次见面。

I force a smile to my lips, "Please... As I have said before feel free to call me Kaworu."  
我强扯出一丝微笑，“请……如我之前所说，随意称呼我为渚薰。”

She nods at me, "Fine, Kaworu it is then! How are you feeling today?"  
她朝我点点头，“好吧，那就叫你渚薰！今天感觉如何？”

I step aside and let her into the room and close the door behind her. I look for a moment and the smile leaves my lips. I consider telling her I am fine but it would not help me to lie to her.  
我侧身让她进屋，随后关上门。我凝视片刻，嘴角的笑容消失了。我本想告诉她我很好，但对她撒谎对我并无益处。

"I am... feeling better. I am still struggling with the nightmares though."  
"我感觉...好些了。不过噩梦还是困扰着我。"

Her expression softened on hearing my words, "That's understandable, a lot of people when they emerge do experience these things for a short amount of time. If they are that bad then I might be able to speak to someone to give you something?"  
她听到我的话后，表情柔和了许多，""这是可以理解的，很多人刚醒来时都会短暂经历这些。如果它们真的很严重，我可以找人给你开点什么吗？""

I shake my head, "No, I would... as frightening as they are I should deal with them. I fear that they are not just a symptom of the emergence but something else. It is just... I am not used to the experience of dreaming either."  
我摇了摇头，""不，我宁愿...尽管它们很可怕，但我应该自己面对。我担心它们不仅仅是苏醒的症状，还有别的原因。只是...我也不习惯做梦这种体验。""

"You did not dream beforehand?" She asked me with some surprise in her voice.  
"你之前没有预知到这个梦吗？" 她带着些许惊讶的语气问我。

I shake my head once again, "No I didn't. I needed to rest and sleep in my previous body but dreams were not part of that process. I was told about dreams and what they were and I did wonder what it would be like to experience one. It is... ironic that in receiving my answer it only serves to terrify me."  
我再次摇了摇头，"没有，我之前需要休息和睡眠，但梦境并不属于那个过程。我被告知了梦是什么以及它们是什么样的，我也曾好奇体验梦会是什么感觉。这真是...讽刺，得到答案后反而让我更加恐惧。

"Like I said, if you need anything we can help you."  
"就像我说的，如果你需要什么，我们可以帮你。"

"I... Thank you, I will deal with it for the moment but remember your offer."  
"我...谢谢你，我会暂时处理这件事，但请记住你的提议。"

I look awkwardly around the room searching for some words to say. Before all of this, words would come to me so easily. Now I find myself struggling for things to say to people, I find myself silent a lot of the time.  
我尴尬地环顾房间，寻找着合适的言辞。在这之前，话语总是自然而然地涌出。如今，我发现自己与人交谈时常常词穷，很多时候都沉默不语。

I look towards Kodama again. She was not only the one who found me last week but she is also the one who has been helping me figure things out and guide me somewhat. When I remembered who I was she was the first one I told. She did not seem to be angry at me or upset with me despite knowing who and what I was. She is curious and something about her is familiar yet I do not know quite what it is.  
我又看向 Kodama。她不仅是在上周找到我的人，也是一直帮助我理清思绪、引导我的人。当我记起自己是谁时，她是第一个我告诉的人。尽管知道我的身份和来历，她似乎并不生气或失望。她充满好奇，有一种熟悉感萦绕在她身上，但我又说不出那是什么。

I think of something to say and strangely one question comes to mind, "Can I ask... what is going to happen to me?"  
我想找些话说，却奇怪地冒出一个问题，“我能问……我会怎么样吗？”

I pause for a moment, "It is my understanding that this facility was made for people to stay in on a temporary basis, am I right in assuming this is the case for me too?"  
我停顿了一下，“据我所知，这个设施是为人们暂时停留而建的，我这样理解对吗？”

Kodama let's out a sigh and shifts from one leg to the other, "Well actually that is why I'm here to talk to you. Your... situation is a unique one Kaworu. There is a lot of discussion going on above me that I'm not exactly privy too."  
Kodama 叹了口气，换了个站姿，“实际上，我正是为此来和你谈的。你的……情况很特殊，Kaworu。上面有很多讨论，我并不完全知情。”

"That is... understandable." I reply.  
“那是……可以理解的。”我回答道。

"Not just because of who you were but also because of who you are now, you see usually when people emerge and we know who they are we'll start a process of tracking down friends and family."  
“不仅仅是因为你过去的身份，还因为现在的你。你知道，通常当人们出现并且我们知道他们是谁时，我们会开始追踪他们的朋友和家人。”

It's hard for me to hide the sadness in my voice a I reply to her, "And I do not have either of those."  
我很难掩饰声音中的悲伤，回答她：“而我两者都没有。”

She steps forwards and places a warm comforting hand on my shoulder, "You don't have anything?"  
她向前一步，将一只温暖抚慰的手放在我的肩上，“你什么都没有吗？”

I shake my head, "Nothing, I was born into what the world knew as SEELE. My entire existence and upbringing were based around one thing and one thing alone. I... I was not supposed to live past that moment."  
我摇摇头，“什么都没有，我出生在世人所知的 SEELE。我的整个存在和成长都是围绕着一件事，而且只有这一件事。我……我本不该活过那一刻。”

"Kaworu..." She pulls me in closer, not quite hugging me completely but just enough to comfort me.  
“薰……”她将我拉得更近，虽然没有完全拥抱我，但足以给予我安慰。

"Friends and family were something I did not know, I am... alone in this world."  
朋友和家人是我未曾了解的概念，我...在这个世界上是孤独的。

There is a brief pause, she looks like she wants to say something but is hesitant. Finally, she does actually speak, "There is always Tokyo-2... We have rehomed most of the former NERV staff there and..."  
她顿了一下，看起来想说些什么却又犹豫不决。最终，她还是开口了，“还有东京-2...我们已将大部分前 NERV 员工安置在那里，而且...”

I take a step back and feel the fear rise up inside me as I shake my head, "N-No! I.. I do not think that after what I nearly did... I don't think It would be wise for me to be in such an environment."  
我后退一步，恐惧在心中升起，我摇着头说，“不！我...我不认为经历了那几乎发生的事...我觉得我再去那样的环境是不明智的。”

She steps puts her hand up to her chin and thinks about it for a moment, "I understand. Such things can... wait for the moment. As I mentioned the discussions are going on above me so I do not know the options available yet."  
她将手放在下巴上，沉思片刻，“我明白。这类事情可以……暂且等待时机。正如我所说，讨论正在我之上进行，所以我还不清楚有哪些选项可供选择。”

"I am... a unique and complex case." I say with some humour in my voice.  
“我……是一个独特且复杂的案例。”我带着几分幽默说道。

"Yeah... You certainly are." She smiles reassuringly at me, "It might take some time Kaworu but... whilst you're here I want to make sure you have everything you need to be happy. If you... If you need anything at all just reach out and ask me."  
“是啊……你确实如此。”她微笑着安慰我，“可能需要一些时间，卡沃鲁，但……在你在这里的这段时间，我想确保你拥有一切让你快乐的东西。如果你……如果你需要任何东西，尽管向我提出。”

It is quite an odd feeling to have someone ask me what it is I desire. It's a question I've never been asked before. Usually things were just given to me with an expectation that I would do what is required and no more or less. My upbringing was orchestrated by a committee and handled by many. It was broken down into stages and mapped out for me.  
有人问我想要什么，这种感觉颇为奇异。这个问题我从未被问及。通常情况下，事情会直接交到我手上，期待我按要求行事，不多也不少。我的成长由一个委员会精心策划，由许多人共同照料。它被分解成各个阶段，为我一一规划。

So now I have to think, is there anything that I... Kaworu Nagisa want? What do I desire? What are my likes and dislikes? Who... who exactly am I? I have shelter, I have access to food and I have some small comforts like a warm bed and a television. It's all provided to me and yet I am being offered more?  
所以现在我必须思考，我，碇真嗣，究竟想要什么？我渴望什么？我的喜好和厌恶是什么？我……我究竟是谁？我有住所，有食物可享，还有一些小小的舒适，比如温暖的床和电视机。这一切都已提供给我，然而现在却有人愿意给予更多？

Part of me would feel ungrateful and uncomfortable for asking for anything else. After all is this not enough? I have not exactly done anything to warrant anything else. Yet... there is something I do desire. Something that when I think back on did make me happy in the past and might help me now. I look at Kodama, "Actually... Is there a piano in this facility?"  
我的一部分会觉得要求更多显得不知感恩且不自在。毕竟，这难道还不够吗？我并未真正做过什么来换取更多。然而……我的确有所渴望。当我回想起过去，有些东西确实曾带给我快乐，现在或许也能助我一臂之力。我看向绫波，“实际上……这里有没有钢琴？”

"A piano?" She half smiles as she asks the question and I instantly feel uncomfortable asking for such a thing. Perhaps that was too much, too big of a thing to ask for.  
"一架钢琴？" 她半笑着问，我立刻感到不安，提出这样的要求或许太过分了。可能我要求得太多了，这事儿太大了。

I nod, "Yes... I... I used to enjoy playing the piano. I think... I think it might help if I could play again?"  
我点点头，"是的...我...我以前喜欢弹钢琴。我想...如果我能再弹的话，也许会有所帮助？"

Her smile widens, "I'm not sure but... I'll see what I can do."  
她的笑容更甚，"我不确定，但...我会尽力去办。"

**January 26****th** **- Afternoon** 1 月 26 日 - 下午

My fingers dance lightly across the piano as I feel myself completely lost in my own music. I pay no attention to the book in front of me instead I allow myself to play what it is I desire. I allow myself to play without any idea of what it is that'll come next. I skip from note to note, black key to white key, shifting scale and time signature exploring the full depth of what it is I can do.  
我的手指在钢琴上轻盈跳跃，完全沉浸在自己的音乐中。我不再关注面前的书本，而是任由自己弹奏心中所想。我让自己随心所欲地演奏，不去预想下一刻会是什么旋律。我跳跃在音符之间，黑键与白键交替，变换着音阶和节拍，探索着自己所能达到的深度。

Joy lights up my heart as I play, I feel free, a sensation unlike any I have felt before. I wonder if this is is how all those great musicians felt when they composed. Lost in their music and the worlds they created with their symphonies.  
随着演奏，喜悦点亮了我的心房，我感到自由，一种前所未有的感觉。我不禁思索，那些伟大的音乐家在创作时是否也感受到了这样的心境。迷失在他们的音乐中，以及他们用交响乐创造的世界里。

Kodama had, much to my great joy been able to find a piano. An older model that had been locked away in the facilities storage. It had been brought in when the centre had opened many years ago but put away again when the number of returnees had dropped off. I was of course the first person to emerge for quite some time, it was quite a shock to the people who worked here but they also seemed somewhat pleased to have me around.  
小灵非常高兴地找到了一架钢琴。这是一台较旧的型号，被锁在设施的储藏室里。许多年前，当中心刚开放时，它被搬了进来，但随着返回者人数的减少，它又被收了起来。当然，我是相当长一段时间内第一个出现的人，这对这里的工作人员来说相当震惊，但他们似乎也有些高兴有我在这里。

Since I have returned I have learned a few things from Kodama about this place. Before my return there had been talks of actually repurposing this facility for other usage. The area around Tokyo-3 had recently been discussed as a place of interest for certain groups. I do now know what for and I do not feel I need to know but as far as I have been told until they were certain no one would return this place would remain open.  
自从我回来后，我从小灵那里了解到了一些关于这个地方的事情。在我回来之前，曾有人讨论过将这个设施改作他用。东京-3 周边地区最近被某些团体讨论为感兴趣的地方。我现在不知道是为了什么，我也不觉得我需要知道，但据我所知，在他们确定没有人会回来之前，这个地方会一直开放。

I bring my improvisation to a halt and almost immediately I hear the sounds of polite applause from behind me. I feel myself blush immensely as I turn around and see Kodama beaming at me from across the room.  
我停止了即兴演奏，几乎立刻就听到了身后礼貌的掌声。我感到自己脸红得厉害，转过身去，看到小灵在房间的另一边对我微笑。

"That was amazing Kaworu! How long have you been playing for?"  
"那真是太棒了，薰！你弹琴多久了？"

I smile nervously, I am unused to praise for my abilities, in my past I was told what I did was adequate and no more.  
我紧张地笑了笑，我不习惯因我的能力而受到表扬，过去我被告知我所做的一切只是勉强合格，仅此而已。

"As long as I can remember." I say to her, "It was... one of the few forms of entertainment I was granted access to I suppose. My former handlers felt I should have some appreciation for human culture and so the piano was chosen for me along with the works of various classical composers."  
"从我有记忆开始。"" 我回答她，""我想，这是我被允许接触的少数娱乐方式之一。我的前任监护人认为我应该对人类文化有所欣赏，于是钢琴和各种古典作曲家的作品被选中给了我。"

"Was it one of their pieces you were playing just now?"  
"刚才你弹的是他们的作品之一吗？"

I allow myself a smile and shake my head, "It was not... I was... Improvising just now. I suppose you could call it my first act of rebellion against them."  
我微微一笑，摇了摇头，“不是的……我刚才……即兴演奏。我想你可以称之为我对他们的第一次反抗。”

"Rebellion?" She asks with some curiosity.  
"反抗？" 她带着几分好奇问道。

I smile sheepishly, "When I was with them I did enjoy what I was exposed to. I truly thought it was wondrous and the very height of human culture. How people could tell stories and convey emotion with notes on a page. Yet I was limited in what I could do, I was to play only works by the so-called greats. My days were filled with endless recitals of Back, Beethoven, Mozart and so on and so forth."  
我尴尬地笑了笑，“和他们在一起时，我确实享受了我所接触到的一切。我真心认为那是奇妙的，是人类文化的巅峰。人们如何用纸上的音符来讲述故事、传达情感。然而，我所能做的有限，我只能演奏那些所谓大师的作品。我的日子充满了无尽的巴赫、贝多芬、莫扎特等人的曲目。”

"And you didn't enjoy this?"  
“那你不喜欢这样吗？”

"At the time I didn't mind but... I no longer have a desire to go back to those. I wish to create my own path."  
“当时我并不介意，但……我不再有回到那里的欲望了。我希望开创自己的道路。”

Kodama sits herself down near to me, "Sounds like some really pushy parents. So... it was just the 'greats'? No modern stuff at all?"  
小球坐在我旁边，“听起来像是些非常强势的父母。那么...只有‘经典’作品吗？完全没有现代的东西？”

"I am afraid not." I reply, "The past one hundred and fifty years or so of human popular culture is little more than a blank to me. I know a few names here and there but I cannot say I have ever watched a television show properly, I have not seen a movie nor did I listen to anything modern. I was..."  
“恐怕是的。”我回答，“过去一百五十年左右的人类流行文化对我来说几乎是一片空白。我只知道一些零星的名字，但我从未完整地看过一部电视剧，没看过电影，也没听过任何现代音乐。我……”

I trailed off as I see her stand up and come over to me. She sits herself down next to me on the bench and puts an arm around me.  
我话音未落，只见她站起身朝我走来。她在我旁边的长椅上坐下，伸手搂住了我。

"I'm... so sorry you had to go through that Kaworu."  
"我...真的很抱歉，你经历了那些，渚。"

I shrug, "It is... something I have come to accept and I suppose I did not think about it at the time. My life was driven by one purpose, one goal and that was supposed to lead humanity onto its next stage... I..."  
我耸耸肩，“这是...我已经接受的事情，我想当时我并没有多想。我的人生被一个目的、一个目标所驱动，那本应引领人类进入下一个阶段...我...”

I trail off again and sniff as I feel the emotion well up inside of me. A tear trickles down my cheek as she hugs me closer to her.  
我又一次停了下来，吸了吸鼻子，因为情感在我内心涌动。当她更紧地拥抱我时，一滴泪水顺着我的脸颊滑落。

"I was not aware of how lonely my existence was."  
“我未曾意识到自己的存在有多么孤独。”

Her arm tightens, "You don't need to be alone anymore Kaworu. There is a huge world out there and plenty of time for you to explore all sorts of things.  
她的手臂收紧，“你不再需要独自一人了，卡沃鲁。外面有一个广阔的世界，你有足够的时间去探索各种各样的事物。”

I look at her and wipe the tears away, "I am... truly sorry for what I was Kodama..."  
我看着她，擦去泪水，“我……真的为曾经的自己感到抱歉，小玉……”

"you don't have to be." She replies sternly, "What happened... It wasn't your fault. We know what SEELE did to you and also to many others. We know how they hurt and manipulated people. The best thing you can do now is move forward Kaworu..."  
"你不必这样。" 她严肃地回答，"发生的事...不是你的错。我们知道 SEELE 对你和其他许多人做了什么。我们知道他们是如何伤害和操纵人们的。你现在能做的最好的事情就是向前看，Kaworu..."

"I... I guess." "我...我想是的。"

She looks at me, "Anyway I wasn't just hear to attend your little concert, it seems you have a visitor."  
她看着我，"无论如何，我来这里不仅仅是为了参加你的小音乐会，看来你有访客了。"

I look at her in confusion, "A visitor? For me? I do not understand, I don't know anyone here unless..."  
我困惑地看着她，“访客？找我？我不明白，我在这里不认识任何人，除非……”

I can feel my eyes widen as that now familiar feeling of fear rises up inside me again. There is no one in this world I have any attachment to but one but... he could not be the visitor, could he? If he is then... no... I can't face him. I can never face him.  
我能感觉到自己的眼睛因那熟悉的恐惧感再次在内心升起而睁大。在这个世界上，我没有任何牵挂的人，除了一个……但他不可能是那位访客，对吧？如果真的是他……不……我无法面对他。我永远无法面对他。

"Actually..." Kodama speaks up, "We were a little bit confused too, we didn't... think the two of you had any connection but he has insisted on seeing you. He says he wants to help put things right for you."  
“实际上……”Kodama 开口说道，“我们也有点困惑，没想到你们俩会有什么联系，但他坚持要见你。他说他想帮你把事情摆平。”

**Meeting Room 会议室**

I'm not quite sure what to expect as I follow Kodama silently through the corridors of the facility. I try to think about who this person might be, my mind running through a number of possibilities. I had not dared to ask Kodama who this person was fearing what the answer might actually be.  
我并不完全确定会遇到什么，只是默默地跟着 Kodama 穿过设施的走廊。我试图思考这个人可能是谁，脑海中闪过多种可能性。我甚至不敢问 Kodama 这个人是谁，害怕答案会让我难以接受。

My mind had of course wondered if it might be Shinji. When I think about what I know, or at least what I knew of Shinji it would be just like him to come to me wanting to make things right. It'd be just like him to blame himself for what had happened. Yet that was the Shinji of back then, a lot will likely have changed in the five years that have passed.  
当然，我心中也曾猜测过可能是 Shinji。想到我所了解的，或者说我所知道的 Shinji，他来找我想要弥补一切，把责任归咎于自己，这完全像是他会做的事。但那是过去的 Shinji，五年过去了，很多事情可能已经改变。

I of course do not know what I would do if it were Shinji, I sincerely hope it is not him. I am not in a position to face him nor do I think I will ever be. I hurt Shinji badly, I offered him friendship and love when he was at his lowest and I betrayed him. It matters not that my feelings for him were real, I cared for Shinji, I wanted to be friends with him and despite knowing him for a short time I dare say that I felt love for him.  
当然，我不知道如果是真嗣我会怎么做，我真诚地希望不是他。我没有面对他的立场，也不认为我会有那样的勇气。我深深伤害了真嗣，在他最低谷时我给予了他友谊和爱，却背叛了他。尽管我对他的感情是真挚的，我关心真嗣，想与他成为朋友，尽管与他相识时间短暂，我敢说我对他的爱是真切的。

Yet I could not do anything to fight against the cruel masters known as SEELE or the call that I felt within my heart. Yet these things matter not, it has all happened and I cannot go back. I cannot change what transpired. I can only go on knowing that my actions helped drive Shinji to his lowest point and hope that he has maybe found some peace.  
然而，我无法对抗那些被称为 SEELE 的残酷主宰或内心深处的呼唤。但这些都无关紧要，一切已经发生，我无法回到过去。我无法改变已经发生的事。我只能继续前行，知道我的行为将真嗣推向了最低谷，并希望他或许找到了一些安宁。

I try to think of other possibilities, perhaps I can eliminate Shinji as a possibility. Kodama said she didn't think me and this other person had any connection. There were others in NERV that had encountered me only a number of time. Yet I cannot think of anyone who would wish to make anything up to me.  
我试图考虑其他可能性，也许我可以排除真嗣的可能性。Kodama 说她不认为我和这个人有任何联系。在 NERV 中，还有其他人只与我有过几次接触。然而，我想不出有谁会对我编造任何事情。

There is another possibility, perhaps a fallen member of SEELE but then… which one would have had such a change of heart? They all treated me with such disdain, like the tool that I was. Those old men would never change, I am certain of that.  
还有一种可能性，或许是 SEELE 的某个堕落成员，但随后……会是哪一个突然改变了心意呢？他们所有人都对我如此鄙夷，就像对待我这个工具一样。那些老头子绝不会改变，我对此确信无疑。

As we move into another corridor I see Kodama stop and she turns to face me, "Are you nervous?"  
当我们走进另一条走廊时，我看到 Kodama 停下脚步，她转身面对我，“你紧张吗？”

I nod, "Somewhat, I cannot imagine who it is who would wish to meet with me nor can I think of anyone who would wish to put anything right with me. If anything it is I who has a lot to put right with others."  
我点头，“有点，我想不出谁会希望见我，也想不出有谁会希望与我修复关系。如果有的话，那也是我有许多需要与他人修复的关系。”

"You know… you yourself were not to blame for what happened Kaworu." Kodama looks at me sternly as she speaks, "In your situation I think… I think all of us would have acted in the same way. You were born into that organization, you were raised by them and conditioned by them. Yet when it came to it you did not destroy us, you tried… to give us some hope and allowed humanity to go forward."  
"你知道……你本人并没有因为发生的事情而受到责备，Kaworu。" Kodama 严肃地看着我说话，"在你的处境下，我想……我认为我们所有人都会做出同样的选择。你出生在那个组织，由他们抚养和训练。然而，当那一刻来临时，你没有摧毁我们，你试图……给我们一些希望，让人类继续前进。"

I look at her and shake my head, "I hurt someone who had placed all their trust in me in the process."  
我看着她，摇了摇头，"我在过程中伤害了一个完全信任我的人。"

"Perhaps you did but… the way I see it you didn't have a choice. You didn't know better." She replied, "Things ended up alright in the end and… well you have the opportunity to have a life now. Life in Tokyo-3… wasn't easy."  
"也许你确实伤害了，但……在我看来，你别无选择。你当时并不知道更好的方法。"她回答道，"最终事情还是解决了，而且……现在你有机会过上新的生活了。在东京-3 的生活……并不容易。"

I look up at her and find it hard to hide my surprise, "You were in Tokyo-3?"  
我抬头看她，难以掩饰我的惊讶，“你曾在东京-3？”

She shoots me a grin, "Yeah! Although we actually evacuated shortly before your arrival. If things had been different… well you probably would have been one of my sisters' classmates!"  
她冲我咧嘴一笑，“是啊！不过我们其实在你到来前不久就撤离了。如果情况不同的话……你可能就成了我妹妹的同学呢！”

"Y-Your sister?" “你-你的妹妹？”

Kodama nods, "Yup! Hikari, she was the class rep at that time!"  
木灵点头，“嗯！光，她当时是班代表！”

"Of course." I mutter, now I know where I have heard Kodama's name before. Hikari was one of the students that would have been in his class. He had been given a file about his fellow classmates before he was sent to Tokyo-3.  
“当然。”我喃喃自语，现在我知道在哪里听过木灵的名字了。光是他班上的学生之一。在他被派往东京-3 之前，他曾收到过一份关于同班同学的资料。

"I… I thought your name seemed familiar… I was… SEELE give me a list of people who would have been in my class."  
“我……我以为你的名字听起来很熟悉……我……SEELE 给了我一份可能在我班上的人的名单。”

She shakes her head, "You don't need to explain, anyway we shouldn't keep our guest waiting any longer."  
她摇了摇头，“你不必解释，反正我们也不该让客人久等了。”

Kodama opens the door for me and I look into the room and fix my gaze on the elderly man wearing a dark blue suit and tie. He has a folder tucked under one arm and I'm surprised to see a warm smile on his face. He looks towards myself and Kodama and with his gaze I feel myself rooted to the spot. Of all the possibilities I did not consider that my visitor would be the former NERV Sub Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki.  
Kodama 为我打开门，我望进房间，目光定格在一位身着深蓝色西装和领带的老人身上。他腋下夹着一个文件夹，我惊讶地看到他脸上挂着温暖的微笑。他转向我和 Kodama，他的目光让我感觉自己仿佛被钉在了原地。在所有可能性中，我从未料到我的访客会是前 NERV 副指挥官 Kozo Fuyutsuki。

He bows politely, "Ms Horaki, Mr Nagisa."  
他礼貌地鞠了一躬，“Horaki 小姐，Nagisa 先生。”

I bow my head politely, "H-Hello."  
我礼貌地低下头，“您好。”

Kodama also greets him politely, "Mr Fuyutsuki."  
Kodama 也礼貌地向他打招呼，“Fuyutsuki 先生。”

I avert my eyes for a moment and look around the meeting room. It was a fairly basic affair, they had set up a small coffee table along with a couch and some comfortable chairs. A few colourful plants and pictures had been placed around the edges for decoration. Guided by Kodama I make my way into the room and sit myself down on the couch next to her.  
我短暂地移开视线，环顾会议室。这里相当简朴，他们摆放了一张小咖啡桌，还有一张沙发和几把舒适的椅子。四周点缀着一些色彩鲜艳的植物和画作。在 Kodama 的引导下，我走进房间，在她旁边的沙发上坐下。

This was most certainly not what I was expecting. I admittedly know very little about Fuyutsuki. I know what he was Gendo Ikari's right hand man at NERV and had some history with both Gendo and Yui Ikari. Outside of that I know nothing else, he was a non-factor in my mission.  
这绝对不是我所预料的。坦白说，我对冬月了解甚少。我知道他是 NERV 中碇源堂的得力助手，与碇源堂和碇唯都有一段过往。除此之外，我一无所知，他在我的任务中无关紧要。

"Thank you for arranging this." He speaks to Kodama before turning to look at me, "How are you feeling Mr Nagisa?"  
“感谢你安排这次会面。”他对儿玉说道，然后转向我，“你感觉如何，碇先生？”

I nod, "I am… feeling okay."  
我点头，“我……感觉还好。”

"That is good to hear, I understand myself that emerging from the sea is not the most pleasant of feelings. I will not take up too much of your time."  
"听到这个消息真好，我自己也深知从海中出来并不是最愉快的感觉。我不会占用你太多时间。"

"I… do not mind." I say to him before continuing and expressing my confusion, "I must admit that I am somewhat confused by your being here. It was mentioned that… well you wanted to…"  
"我…并不介意。" 我对他继续说道，表达我的困惑，"我必须承认，我对您在这里感到有些困惑。之前提到过…嗯，您似乎想要…"

"Make things up to you?" Fuyutsuki finishes my sentence for me, "Yet you do not recall us meeting. This is true, we did not meet once during your brief moments in Tokyo-3."  
"弥补你？" 冬月替我把话说完，"但你却不记得我们见过面。确实如此，在你短暂停留在第三新东京市期间，我们未曾谋面。"

I nod, "Then… what do you have to make right with me?"  
我点头，“那么……你有什么要向我弥补的吗？”

He shakes his head and sighs, "Perhaps I used the wrong phrase. I suppose… well what I am doing is a little bit selfish on my part. An attempt to make myself feel better about what happened for aiding in ruining the lives of many. Since that Third Impact I have been… making an attempt to contribute and help those who need it."  
他摇摇头叹息道，“或许我用错了词。我想……好吧，我所做的是有点自私。试图让自己对参与毁掉许多人生活的事情感觉好一些。自从第三次冲击后，我一直在……努力贡献并帮助那些需要帮助的人。”

I look at Kodama in confusion and she starts to speak, "Fuyutsuki was actually one of the founding members of this facility. He left after the first year though to travel the world and provide medical aid to those who needed it in areas damaged by the two Impact incidents. Fuyutsuki was… also instrumental in making sure the survivors of Tokyo-3 were given appropriate support and compensation packages."  
我困惑地看着 Kodama，她开始解释，“Fuyutsuki 实际上是这个设施的创始成员之一。不过他在第一年后就离开了，去世界各地为那些在两次冲击事件中受灾的地区提供医疗援助。Fuyutsuki 还……在确保东京-3 的幸存者得到适当的支持和补偿方面发挥了重要作用。”

"I… I see…" I stutter out a response, "So… you wish to help me?"  
"我…我明白了…" 我结结巴巴地回应，"那么…你是想帮助我吗？"

He nods, "I do. I'm going to be travelling to Europe shortly and will be staying in Germany for quite some time. I'm in need of an assistant to help me in my work. It will not be difficult work, nothing you couldn't learn to do easily. You will of course be paid for your work and on top of that I will ensure you have a place to stay on top of the compensation package you'll receive as a former pilot."  
他点头道，"是的。我不久将前往欧洲，并在德国停留相当长的时间。我需要一位助手协助我的工作。这不会是困难的工作，你很容易就能学会。当然，你会得到报酬，除此之外，我还会确保你有一个住处，作为前飞行员，你还将获得额外的补偿。"

I look at him in confusion, "I don't understand, surely there are many others already more qualified to do this than I. After all you know the circumstances of what I was and who I am."  
我困惑地看着他，"我不明白，肯定有许多人比我更有资格做这份工作。毕竟，你知道我的过去和我的身份。"

He nods again, "Yes I do, I know who you are and what SEELE did for you. I know that you and the other pilots have all experienced something horrible in your lives and I also know that I am partly to blame for that."  
他再次点头，“是的，我知道你是谁，以及 SEELE 为你做了什么。我知道你和其他驾驶员都曾在生活中经历过可怕的事情，我也知道我对此负有部分责任。”

He pauses for a moment to sip from his coffee, "I know that if I were to live another hundred years I could not possibly erase all the damage I have done but I wish to do what I can whilst I can."  
他停顿了一下，啜饮了一口咖啡，“我知道即使我再活一百年，也无法弥补我所造成的所有伤害，但我希望在我还能做些什么的时候尽力而为。”

"So that includes helping me?"  
“所以这包括帮助我吗？”

"Yes. I… do not expect you to answer me right away and I will not mind if you choose to reject my offer. I understand if you want to leave this place and forge a new life away from me and all of this but I ask that you at least consider it."  
"是的。我……并不期望你立刻答复，如果你选择拒绝我的提议，我也不会介意。我理解你想要离开这个地方，开启远离我和这一切的新生活，但我恳请你至少考虑一下。"

"I-I see…" I nod again as he places a folder down on the table, "In which case I shall consider your offer."  
"我明白了……" 我再次点头，他放下一个文件夹在桌上，"那么，我会考虑你的提议。"

**February 9****th** **- Facility Entranceway**  
2 月 9 日 - 设施入口处

It has been two weeks now since Fuyutsuki come to me with his offer of aiding me in starting a new life and working for him. Since his visit I looked extensively over the information he provided trying to understand what it was I would be doing. It seems that I will be aiding Fuyutsuki mostly in an administrative capacity. It seems like fairly basic things, filling out reports and mailing them for him. Handling calls and arranging appointments. All things that I feel I'm capable of doing.  
自两周前冬月向我提出帮助我开启新生活并为他工作的提议以来，自他来访后，我仔细研究了他提供的信息，试图理解我将要做的事情。看来我将主要在行政方面协助冬月。似乎都是相当基础的事情，填写报告并为他寄出。处理电话和安排预约。这些都是我觉得自己能够胜任的工作。

For accepting this role I'll be paid a wage and given my own apartment in Berlin. This will be on top of a package I'll be receiving from the UN as part of my compensation. I still don't really understand why I'm owed anything for my role in NERV. If anything I nearly destroyed their world rather than saved it.  
接受这个职位，我将获得薪水，并在柏林拥有自己的公寓。这将在我作为补偿从联合国收到的包裹之外。我仍然不太明白为什么我因为参与 NERV 的角色而欠我什么。如果说有什么的话，我差点毁了他们的世界而不是拯救了它。

As I stand here I wonder if I am right in accepting Fuyutsuki's offer. I look at this as an opportunity to finally start to learn about the world and experience what life has to offer. As I stand her though all I feel is sadness and the familiar sense of fear once more.  
当我站在这里时，我怀疑接受冬月的提议是否正确。我将此视为一个机会，终于开始了解世界并体验生活所提供的一切。然而，当我站在这里时，我所感受到的只有悲伤和再次熟悉的恐惧感。

I look behind me at the entrance to the facility that I have called my home for the last month. This place has been a safe space for me that has helped shelter me from the pain that I know waits outside its walls. It is a place where all I had to fear were the thoughts inside my head, but out here I have so much more to be afraid of.  
我回头望向那座设施的入口，过去一个月里，我称之为家的地方。这个地方曾是我安全的避风港，让我免受墙外已知痛苦的侵扰。在这里，我所恐惧的不过是脑海中的思绪，但走出这里，我有着更多需要害怕的事物。

"Nervous?" I hear Kodama's voice from behind me.  
“紧张吗？”我听到 Kodama 从身后传来的声音。

I nod, "Before… Before I was sent to Tokyo-3… Keel and the others in SEELE would often tell me about this world. They would tell me how corrupt and unsafe it was, about how dangerous humanity was. They would inform me of news reports on terrorist attacks, wars, murder, sexual assault and more. They told me about the world dark history, its many genocides, slavery and violent conquests."  
我点点头，“在被送到第三新东京市之前……Keel 和 SEELE 的其他成员经常向我描述这个世界。他们告诉我这个世界多么腐败和危险，人类有多么可怕。他们向我通报有关恐怖袭击、战争、谋杀、性侵犯等新闻。他们还向我讲述了世界黑暗的历史，多次种族灭绝、奴隶制和暴力征服。”

"They really tried to get you to believe humanity was at a dead end didn't they?"  
"他们真的试图让你相信人类已经走到了绝路，不是吗？"

I nod again, "Yes… I think that even then I knew what they were doing. I knew they were hiding the positive and beauty of the world from me. After all how could a world so bad produce the beautiful music I heard and performed?"  
我再次点头，"是的……我想那时我就知道他们在做什么。我知道他们对我隐瞒了世界的积极与美好。毕竟，一个如此糟糕的世界怎能孕育出我所听到并演奏的美丽音乐呢？"

I shuffle my feet, "I know the beauty of this world but I know it is dangerous and I am afraid."  
我挪动着脚步，"我知道这个世界的美好，但我也知道它是危险的，我感到害怕。"

"I understand, it can be scary out there."  
"我明白，外面的世界可能很可怕。"

"Also…" I pause, "I will be returning to Germany… to Berlin the… place of my 'birth' as it were."  
"还有……" 我停顿了一下，"我将回到德国……回到柏林，那个可以说是'诞生'我的地方。"

"Do you remember anything of the city?"  
"你对这座城市还有记忆吗？"

I shake my head, "Nothing, only a few pictures. I was never allowed out into the city itself. I can only remember parts of the facility that I was raised in."  
我摇摇头，“没什么，只是几张照片。我从未被允许进入城市本身。我只记得我长大的那个设施的部分区域。”

"Well it's a beautiful city from what I hear. I'm sure you'll love it."  
“听说那是个美丽的城市。我相信你会喜欢它的。”

"I hope so." I smile and watch as a black car pulls up in front of us, "I suppose that this is goodbye."  
“希望如此。”我微笑着，看着一辆黑色汽车停在我们面前，“我想这就是告别了。”

She nods before grabbing and pulling me close to her and hugging me, "Good luck Kaworu, please promise you'll stay in touch. I want to know everything okay?"  
她点点头，随即抓住我，将我拉近并拥抱我，“祝你好运，卡沃鲁，请答应我会保持联系。我想知道一切，好吗？”

I nod, "I will. Thank you for everything Kodama."  
我点头，“我会的。谢谢你的一切，小玉。”

With those words she releases me from the hug. I pick up the small suitcase I have and walk towards the car. I'm greeted by a smiling man in a suit, he takes the case from me and places it in the boot of the car. I feel a cool breeze around me as I turn and give Kodama and the facility one last glance.  
说完这些话，她松开了拥抱。我提起小行李箱，走向汽车。一位西装革履的男子微笑着迎接我，他从我手中接过箱子，放入后备箱。我转身再次看向小玉和设施，感到一阵凉风拂过。

I get into the back of the car and moments later it slowly pulls away from the facility. I now take the opportunity to take the gift Kodama has given me from my pocket. A music player filled with music of influential musicians from the late 60s through to the present day. I hear the music fill my ears as I gaze out of the window.  
我钻进车后座，片刻后车子缓缓驶离了设施。现在我有机会从口袋里拿出小玉给我的礼物。一个装满了从 60 年代末到现代有影响力的音乐家作品的音乐播放器。我听着音乐充盈耳际，目光投向窗外。

I suppose this is onward towards my new future, a future that I did not expect I would ever have.  
我想这应该是朝着我的新未来前进，一个我未曾预料会拥有的未来。

### Chapter 2: Both Sides Of The Story  
第二章：故事的两面  

**August 15th 8 月 15 日**

**Cafe – Berlin – Early Morning  
咖啡馆 – 柏林 – 清晨**

As I step out of the hot morning sun that shines overhead in Berlin and into the cool air-conditioned space that the café offers I reach up and take off my sunglasses. I look around and see a few people are here already. University students mostly come to study or recover from a night out drinking. Finally, I spot my target, a small and empty seat by the window, a perfect spot for me. I walk over and set my laptop down on the table, plug it into the wall socket and prepare to start my work.  
当我走出柏林头顶炽热的晨光，步入咖啡馆提供的凉爽空调空间时，我伸手摘下了太阳镜。环顾四周，发现已经有几个人在这里了。大多是大学生，来这里学习或从一夜畅饮中恢复。最终，我找到了目标，一个靠窗的小空位，对我来说再合适不过了。我走过去，把笔记本电脑放在桌上，插上电源，准备开始工作。

I'm barely able to load up the document before I hear a loud voice from behind me call out my name, "Asuka! It's so nice to see you, your usual?"  
我还没来得及打开文档，就听到身后一个响亮的声音喊出了我的名字，“明日香！见到你真高兴，还是老样子吗？”

I turn to look and call back with a grin, "Of course!"  
我转过身，笑着回应道：“当然！”

I see the source of the voice get to work behind the counter. He's the owner of this café, a short, jolly rotund man with a bushy blonde moustache. I always thought he looked a bit out of place running a café like this. He looks more like he'd be at home as one of the Gauls from and Asterix and Obelix comic.  
我看到声音的主人在柜台后忙碌起来。他是这家咖啡馆的老板，一个矮小、圆润且总是笑呵呵的男人，留着浓密的金色八字胡。我一直觉得他经营这样一家咖啡馆有些格格不入。他看起来更像是从《阿斯泰利克斯历险记》里走出来的高卢人。

Yet here he is running a café like this, not only does he run it but he is very good at it. It's become quite a popular little place since it opened up about a year ago. I come here frequently to get on with my work.  
然而，他就在这里经营着这样一家咖啡馆，不仅经营得有声有色，而且非常擅长。自从大约一年前开业以来，这里已经变得相当受欢迎。我经常来这里工作。

In barely any time at all I find him stood behind me, setting my coffee down on the table.  
几乎没过多久，我就发现他站在我身后，将我的咖啡放在桌上。

I smile politely, "Thank you, is it only you wokring today?"  
我礼貌地微笑，“谢谢，今天只有你一个人上班吗？”

He shakes his head, "Sofia should be coming in shortly. So, what are you working on?"  
他摇摇头，“索菲亚应该很快就会来。那么，你在忙什么呢？”

I shrug, "Nothing overly important. I'm just trying to finish up a few edits for the book before I send it off to the publishers for review. It's still a bit of a rough draft but it seems they want to make the announcement early and get some previews made. They want to make sure they get the news out of the sequel whilst there is still some hype for the original."  
我耸耸肩，“没什么特别重要的。我只是想在把书稿发给出版社审阅之前，完成一些修改。虽然还是个粗糙的草稿，但他们似乎想提前宣布并制作一些预览。他们希望在原作还有些热度的时候，确保续集的消息能及时发布。”

"Oh! How exciting!" He booms, "Does that mean you'll be getting interviewed by the press?"  
"哦！多令人兴奋啊！" 他大声说道，"那是不是意味着你将要接受媒体的采访了？"

"No chance!" I exclaim and shake my head, "I'm not even bothered if the damn thing gets published. It was just because a friend opened their mouth to someone the first one got published, I just want to write them."  
"没门！" 我大声否认并摇摇头，"我根本不在乎那玩意儿会不会出版。只是因为一个朋友对某人说了什么，第一篇才得以发表，我只想写它们。"

"You don't fancy even a small bit of the publicity from it?"  
"你难道一点都不向往由此带来的那点儿名气吗？"

"Like I care about something like that!" I snort with laughter, "Why do you think I write under a pseudonym? I don't need to be noticed or popular, other people can do all that."  
“像我会在乎那种事似的！”我嗤之以鼻，笑了起来，“你以为我为什么要用笔名写作？我不需要被关注或受欢迎，其他人可以做这些。”

For a brief moment it seems as though his expression changes to one of disbelief or confusion but in a second he goes back to his smiling self. I suppose I can maybe forgive his confusion, after all it is perhaps strange that someone would go to the effort of working so hard on something like I did and when it's out there not wishing for any publicity but he doesn't know me. He doesn't know the real me anyway.  
有那么一瞬间，他似乎露出了难以置信或困惑的表情，但很快又恢复了笑容。我想我可以理解他的困惑，毕竟有人如此努力地创作，却不希望得到任何关注，这或许很奇怪。但他并不了解我，无论如何，他不知道真正的我。

Maybe once upon a time I'd have welcomed the publicity and opportunity to be noticed. I'd have demanded the publicity and been on hand to sign copies and have my name be known. I'm no longer that person though. Now I just want peace and quiet and for people to leave me alone. I'm not that bratty kid who demanded to be seen and be the centre of attention. I no longer desire for people to praise me constantly and worship the ground I walk on.  
也许曾经我会欢迎曝光和被关注的机会。我会要求曝光，亲自签名售书，让我的名字广为人知。但我已不再是那个人了。现在我只想要平静和安宁，希望人们不要打扰我。我不再是那个要求被看见、成为焦点的任性孩子。我不再渴望人们不断地赞美我，崇拜我走过的地面。

I am no longer Asuka Langley Soryu, the brash Evangelion pilot. I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I live in Berlin and I write teen fiction as a hobby. Somehow, I managed to be quite good at it, a part of me isn't surprised though. It's not as if I don't normally become good at things I turn my hand to.  
我不再是那个鲁莽的 EVA 驾驶员——惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，住在柏林，业余时间写写青少年小说。不知怎么的，我在这方面做得相当不错，虽然内心某处并不感到意外。毕竟，我通常一旦着手做什么事，总能做得很好。

Of course, to the owner of this café I'm just known as Asuka, a half Japanese, half German 19-year-old who has lived in the city all my life. He knows nothing of who I was, of who I used to be and nowadays no one knows that anymore. I made sure that no one would know where or who I was when I left Japan. I asked for all my records to be replaced with fresh ones, nothing would tie me to what had happened anymore. I asked for all contact to be cut off and to be left alone by the UN or whatever it was NERV would become.  
当然，在这家咖啡馆老板的眼中，我只是明日香，一个半日本半德国血统的 19 岁女孩，一生都生活在这个城市。他对我过去的身份一无所知，如今也没人再知晓了。离开日本时，我确保没有人会知道我的过去或我是谁。我要求用全新的记录替换掉所有旧档案，不再有任何东西能将我与那些往事联系起来。我请求切断所有联系，并希望联合国或无论 NERV 将变成什么组织，都不要来打扰我。

I'm not stupid though, I know that they're still out there watching me. I can sense their presence much in the same way that I could when I was younger. It's not Section 2 anymore but someone else but I know they're there. I was tempted at one point to contact them to tell them to stop and that they didn't need to watch over me but it'd just be more unnecessary hassle that I didn't need. Besides contacting them was a risk, if I contacted them the wrong person might say something and that would lead to people know where I was. So, I'll allow it for now, as long as they keep their distance and no promises get broken.  
我并不傻，我知道他们还在外面监视我。我能感觉到他们的存在，就像我年轻时那样。不再是第二区了，而是其他人，但我知道他们在那里。曾经有一刻我想联系他们，告诉他们停止监视，我不需要他们保护，但这只会带来不必要的麻烦。而且联系他们有风险，如果联系错了人，可能会泄露我的位置。所以，我现在允许他们这样做，只要他们保持距离，不违背承诺。

I'm about to go back to the document when I hear the owners voice again, "Will you be having lunch? Eggs are nice and fresh this morning."  
我正要回到文件前，又听到了主人的声音，“您要吃午饭吗？今天早上的鸡蛋很新鲜。”

My stomach rumbles at his offer, I skipped breakfast this mornign and it is coming up to lunch time. Maybe I should eat before I start work. I shoot him a smile, "Sound good, eggs it is then, scrambled and with bacon, sausage and toast I think."  
他的提议让我的肚子咕咕叫了起来，我今早没吃早餐，现在快到午饭时间了。也许我应该先吃点东西再开始工作。我对他笑了笑，“听起来不错，那就来份炒蛋，再加培根、香肠和吐司吧。”

**Tokyo 2 – Afternoon 东京 2 号——午后**

I'm sat nervously in the reception area of the building the UN has here in Tokyo-2. Laid carefully at my feet is my cello case and my eyes keep up a pattern of moving from the case to the clock on the wall and then at the receptionist as she does her work. It's been half an hour since I came in here and this pattern was started. All I want is for Misato to be finished with her meeting so that we can go home.  
我紧张地坐在联合国在东京 2 号设立的办公楼接待区。我的大提琴箱小心地放在脚边，我的目光不断在琴箱、墙上的时钟和正在工作的接待员之间来回移动。自从我半小时前进来这里，这种模式就开始了。我只希望美里能结束她的会议，这样我们就可以回家了。

I don't like being outside any longer than is necessary, if I can help It I barely go outside at all. I'm I'm told to then I will but most of the time I always have to be accompanied by someone. Being outside on my own terrifies me. I'm scared that someone might recognize me, know about me and what I've done.  
我不喜欢在外面待太久，如果可以的话，我几乎不外出。如果被要求外出，我会去，但大多数时候我总是需要有人陪同。独自在外面让我感到恐惧。我害怕有人可能会认出我，知道我的事情和我所做的一切。

There is a part of me that is trying hard to reject that. It's there using Misato's words, or the words of my friends to tell me that no one is going to recognize me and even if they did I haven't done anything wrong. They tell me that no one knows any of the pilot's identities and the pilots are the ones who saved the world, especially me.  
我内心有一部分正竭力抗拒这一点。它用美里的话，或是朋友们的言辞来告诉我，没有人会认出我，即便他们认出来了，我也没做错什么。他们告诉我，没有人知道任何驾驶员的身份，而这些驾驶员正是拯救了世界的人，尤其是我。

Yet those voices are so easily surprised by a louder one. It sounds like myself and it tells me that everyone I pass in the street secretly knows who I am and one day one of them is going to hurt me. It tells me that if they did hurt me that I deserve it. It tells me that when it does happen I'll have no one to blame but myself because I was really the one who nearly caused this world to end, I was the one responsible for the Third Impact and for ruining so many people's lives.  
然而，这些声音很容易被一个更响亮的声音所惊扰。那个声音听起来像是我自己，它告诉我，我在街上遇到的每个人其实都暗中知道我是谁，总有一天其中一个人会伤害我。它告诉我，如果他们真的伤害了我，那是我应得的。它告诉我，当这一切发生时，我只能怪自己，因为实际上是我差点导致了这个世界末日，我是引发第三次冲击和毁掉无数人生活的罪魁祸首。

I shake my head slightly, no. I mustn't think that. It wasn't like that, I wasn't to blame. I know it. I know I wasn't to blame.  
我轻轻摇头，不，我不能这么想。事实并非如此，我不是罪魁祸首。我知道的，我知道我不是罪魁祸首。

"Mr Ikari?" "碇先生？"

I nearly jump out of my seat at the sudden sound of the receptionist's voice. I look up to see her looking at me with an amused look on her face. I start to blush thinking about what an idiot I must have looked like.  
接待员突如其来的声音几乎让我从座位上跳起来。我抬头一看，只见她正带着一丝戏谑的表情看着我。想到自己刚才那副傻样，我不禁脸红起来。

"Can I get you something whilst you wait?"  
"您在等待的时候需要点什么吗？"

I shake my head, "N-No... No, thank you."  
我摇摇头，“不……不用了，谢谢。”

With those words the silence fills the room once more and I go back to my routine of looking from the clock to my cello case. I decide to leave the receptionist out of this now, still feeling like an idiot for jumping like that. In a way I'm thankful for that moment, it stopped the negative thoughts for a moment and now I can work on that.  
说完这些话，寂静再次填满了房间，我又回到了从时钟看到大提琴箱的日常。我决定现在不把接待员牵扯进来，仍然觉得自己刚才那样跳起来像个傻瓜。在某种程度上，我感谢那一刻，它让负面思绪暂时停止，现在我可以专注于处理这些了。

I need to remember what I've been told. Just slow my breathing and go through it all calmly. I knew something like this might happen today but I just need to remember what I tell myself when I go to school or out to get groceries. This is just slightly different to those times, I'm out longer and in a different part of the city.  
我需要记住别人告诉我的话。只需放慢呼吸，平静地应对一切。我知道今天可能会发生类似的事情，但我只需要记住自己去学校或外出购物时对自己说的话。这次只是稍微不同，我外出时间更长，身处城市的另一个区域。

I glance back down at my cello case as I keep making an effort to calm myself down. It's been a long time since I've played the thing. The last time was that night so many years ago, a night that is still fresh in my memory for all the wrong reasons. It feels like that night was the beginning or end of something, nothing that followed it was good and it was all my fault. If only I had acted differently then maybe... No... I can't... not again.  
我再次低头看向我的大提琴箱，努力让自己平静下来。已经很久没有碰过这把琴了。上次演奏还是在许多年前的那个夜晚，那个因种种错误原因而记忆犹新的夜晚。感觉那个夜晚是某种开始或结束，之后的一切都不好，而且都是我的错。如果当时我能有不同的举动，也许……不……我不能再这样了。

I feel my hands clench into a fist, my nails dig into the flesh in frustration as I once again try to get rid of those negative thoughts. It's just so difficult to do that today, I thought it would be but I just didn't know how hard. Why am I remembering that night, it happened years ago and I did nothing wrong. She did nothing wrong we were all... different then. You're not that Shinji anymore and Asuka... well she's gone now so that doesn't matter.  
我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲因沮丧而深深陷入肉中，我再次试图摆脱那些负面思绪。今天这样做太难了，我本以为会如此，只是没想到会这么难。我为什么要记起那个夜晚，那已经是多年前的事了，我并没有做错什么。她也没有做错，我们当时都……不一样。你不再是那个真嗣了，而明日香……她已经离开了，所以那已经不重要了。

I look up just in time to see the door under the clock open suddenly. I see two people enter the lobby in suits and for just a brief moment I see one of them look over at me with what seems to be a confused look on his face.  
我及时抬头，正好看到时钟下的门突然打开。我看到两个人穿着西装进入大厅，就在那一瞬间，我看到其中一人似乎带着困惑的表情朝我这边看了一眼。

He recognizes me, doesn't he? That's why he's looking at me like that! Any moment now he's going to come over here and I'll be...  
他认出我了，对吧？所以他才会那样看着我！随时他都可能走过来，而我将会……

My fingers dig more into my hands and the pain briefly snaps me out of it. Of course, he doesn't recognize me. He's probably confused as to what a 19-year-old kid is doing in a UN building with a cello at his feet.  
我的手指更加用力地掐进手掌，疼痛让我短暂地清醒过来。当然，他没有认出我。他大概只是困惑一个 19 岁的孩子怎么会在联合国大楼里，脚边还放着一把大提琴。

I know this, I know all of this. It makes sense and it's so logical but even with that I can't help but be terrified of them as they pass by me. I can't help but be sure I feel their eyes on me, piercing through me as if they know exactly who and what I am. I can feel time slow down as they go past me and I focus solely on the cello case. I feel sick and my leg starts to tremble slightly.  
我知道这些，我全都知道。这一切都合情合理，逻辑清晰，但即便如此，当他们从我身边经过时，我还是忍不住感到恐惧。我无法不确信我能感觉到他们的目光落在我身上，仿佛能穿透我，知道我究竟是谁，是什么。随着他们从我身边走过，我感到时间似乎变慢了，我全神贯注于大提琴箱上。我感到恶心，我的腿开始微微颤抖。

I hate this, I hate this so much. They're just ordinary people walking past. They aren't going to hurt me or recognize me. Yet it isn't until they finally pass through the entrance to the building and out onto the street that I can let go of the breath I've been holding, unclench my fist and start to try to calm down.  
我讨厌这样，我非常讨厌。他们只是普通的行人路过。他们不会伤害我，也不会认出我。然而，直到他们终于穿过建筑物的入口，走到街上，我才能松开一直屏住的呼吸，松开紧握的拳头，开始尝试平静下来。

This is too much, I should have just gone straight home rather than come here. I thought I was being brave but I'm just hurting myself by doing this. Thankfully I don't have to wait too much longer before the door opens and Misato walks through.  
这太过分了，我本应该直接回家，而不是来这里。我以为自己很勇敢，但这样做只是在伤害自己。幸运的是，我不用等太久，门就开了，Misato 走了进来。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

She doesn't hide her surprise at seeing me sat there waiting for her. I know she'd have expected me to go straight home after the lesson, she of all people knows how hard on me it is to be out like this. I half smile at her and nod, "H-Hey Misato."  
看到我坐在那里等她，她没有掩饰自己的惊讶。我知道她本以为我上完课后会直接回家，她最清楚我这样外出有多难。我朝她半笑了一下，点了点头，"嗨，Misato。"

She rushes over to me looking apologetic, "I'm so sorry I'm late! The meeting ran longer than I expected, have you been here long?"  
她急匆匆地朝我走来，面带歉意，“真对不起，我迟到了！会议比预期的要长，你等很久了吗？”

I stand up, "N-No... not too long anyway. Is everything alright?"  
我站起身，“不...不，也没等多久。一切都还好吗？”

She smiles at me and nods her head, "Everything is fine! I'll tell you about it in the car, I imagine you'll want to just get home now. We'll order food tonight, is that okay?"  
她对我微笑着点点头，“一切都好！我们上车再说吧，我想你现在可能只想回家。今晚我们点外卖，这样可以吗？”

I give her a nod and we make our way out of the building towards the car park. A few moments later I'm loading my cello into the boot of her car, a white Mazda Cosmo which she got shortly after we returned from the Third Impact. It was something she got to replace her Alpine and if I'm being honest I much prefer this car.  
我向她点头示意，我们便朝着停车场走去。片刻后，我将大提琴装进她的白色马自达 Cosmo 后备箱，这辆车是她从第三次冲击归来后不久买的，用以替代她的 Alpine。说实话，我更喜欢这辆车。

As I get into the front passenger seat and put my seatbelt on I already begin to feel a lot calmer. Even more so now that Misato is here.  
当我坐进副驾驶座并系好安全带时，已经感到平静了许多。尤其是现在美里在这里。

Misato gets into the driver's seat and gives me a sympathetic look. My nervous state clearly not going unnoticed by her, she places a calming hand on my leg and speaks, "I'm really proud of you Shinji, I know today won't have been easy for you."  
美里坐进驾驶座，给了我一个同情的眼神。她显然注意到了我的紧张状态，她轻轻地将安抚的手放在我的腿上，说道：“真嗣，我真的很为你骄傲，我知道今天对你来说并不容易。”

I hate it when Misato says she's proud of me. I always feel that little sting of tears behind my eyes when she does so. They're just words I was so unused to hearing and that I never thought I'd hear from anyone and I know she means it. I don't know if I can really express how much hearing that means to me from her, even if it is for something as simple as leaving our apartment.  
我讨厌 Misato 说她为我感到骄傲。每当她这么说时，我总感觉眼后隐隐有泪意。这些话我太不习惯了，也从没想过会有人对我说，我知道她是真心的。我不知道是否能真正表达出从她那里听到这些话对我意味着什么，哪怕只是因为我离开了我们的公寓。

"It... was really hard Misato." I admit to her with a weak smile, "I kept on thinking that at any one moment he was going to realize who I was. I... I don't know if I can do this."  
“这……真的很难，Misato。”我虚弱地笑着向她承认，“我一直想着他随时可能意识到我是谁。我……我不知道我是否能做到。”

The car starts to move onto the street, she keeps her eyes focused on the road as she talks to me, "Well you've done it once Shinji and that is something. It's really up to you whether or not you want to do it again."  
车子开始驶上街道，她目光始终盯着前方，边和我说话，“你已经成功过一次了，真嗣，这是件了不起的事。是否再做一次，真的取决于你自己。”

"Do you think I should?" I ask.  
"你觉得我应该吗？" 我问道。

"That's not my decision Shinji, that's yours to make. Do you want to continue?" Her tone shifts to sound a bit more serious, I already know what she is going to say next, "I don't want you to be doing this for me or for anyone else. I don't want you to do it because I said it might be good for you. You have to do this for yourself, you know I'll be proud of you no matter what, you're like a... no you are my son Shinji and I love you and want you to be happy."  
"这不是我的决定，真嗣，这是你自己的选择。你想继续吗？" 她的语气变得严肃了一些，我已经知道她接下来要说什么了，"我不想你为了我或任何人做这件事。我不想你因为我觉得这对你有好处才去做。你必须为自己做这件事，你知道无论怎样我都会为你骄傲，你就像……不，你就是我的儿子，真嗣，我爱你，希望你快乐。"

There is that phrase again and also the reminder that I am her son now. It's hard to blind away the emotion this time but I manage it. I take a moment to think about what she has said though. This is another thing I need to learn on top of not being afraid of everyone I encounter. I need to do things for myself.  
那句话再次出现，还有我现在是她儿子的提醒。这次很难忽视这种情感，但我还是做到了。我花了一点时间思考她的话。这是我需要学习的另一件事，除了不再害怕遇到的每个人之外。我需要为自己做事。

"I think I'll continue." I finally say after about a minute of thought, "I did... I really enjoyed the lesson despite being afraid."  
"我想我会继续下去。" 我终于在思考了一分钟后说道，"我确实……尽管害怕，但我真的很享受这堂课。"

"So, it went alright?" "那么，一切还顺利吗？"

I nod, "The teacher said I was a lot more advanced than he was expecting. He said that I didn't seem to have lost much of my ability over the years I haven't been playing. He could see where I was rusty and said it'll be a matter or practicing and going back over some of the things I've forgotten."  
我点头，"老师说我比他预期的要进步得多。他说我这些年没玩似乎并没有失去太多能力。他能看到我在哪些地方生疏了，并说这只是一个练习和复习一些遗忘内容的问题。"

I look around to see an eager look in Misato's eye, "Do you need anything? Books? New string? A new bow? Cleaning products? A stand?"  
我环顾四周，看到美里眼中热切的目光，“你需要什么吗？书？新弦？新弓？清洁用品？支架？”

I laugh at her enthusiasm, "No I don't need anything yet, I made sure it was all in good condition before I went to the lesson. My teacher let me know a website where I can buy sheet music too."  
我被她的热情逗笑了，“不，我现在什么都不需要，上课前我已经确保一切都处于良好状态。我的老师还告诉我一个可以购买乐谱的网站。”

"Well that's good then!" “那就好！”

"Yeah it is! I just…" I trail off as I remember what happened towards the end of the lesson.  
“是啊！我只是……” 我话说到一半，突然想起了课快结束时发生的事。

Misato of course notices what, "What?"  
美里当然注意到了，“什么？”

I try to shrug it off, "No… It's nothing…"  
我试图耸耸肩掩饰过去，“没什么……真的没什么……”

"Oh no you don't!" I cringe in my seat and look towards the window, "What is it Shinji?"  
“哦，不，你别想！”我缩在座位里，望向窗外，“怎么了，真嗣？”

I let out a sigh, "Well it's just… my teacher said that he would like to eventually get me on to playing with other people… Maybe even put on a performance one day."  
我叹了口气，“嗯，就是……我的老师说，他希望将来能让我和其他人一起演奏……也许有一天还能登台表演。”

I turn to see her nod, "I see… and what did you say to him?"  
我转头看她点头，“我明白了……那你跟他说了什么？”

"I kinda…" I shrink further down in my seat, "I said yes."  
"我有点…" 我更深地缩进座位里，"我答应了。"

"Even though you knew it might have been a problem for you?"  
"即使你知道这可能会给你带来问题？"

"I just…" I start but trail off and let out a sigh, "He seemed happy when he suggested it so I… I didn't mention it might have been a problem for me."  
"我只是…" 我开口却没说完，叹了口气，"他提出时看起来很高兴，所以我就… 我没提这可能会给我带来问题。"

I shake my head as I return to looking out of the window. I know what she is thinking and it's the same thing I'm thinking. For all the progress I might have made over the years I'm still that same old Shinji. I'm still just saying and going along with things just because it'll make others happy with me.  
我摇了摇头，重新望向窗外。我知道她在想什么，那也正是我在想的。尽管这些年我可能有所进步，但我依然是那个老样子，依旧是那个真嗣。我仍然只是随声附和，顺从行事，只因为这样会让别人对我感到满意。

"Is that something you would like to do?"  
“那是你想做的事吗？”

I hear her ask but I continue looking out of the window pretending I didn't hear her. For doing that she prods me in the leg and asks again, "Shinji! Is that something you would like to do?"  
我听到她问，但我继续假装没听见，望着窗外。为此，她戳了戳我的腿，再次问道：“真嗣！那是你想做的事吗？”

All I can do this time is muster up a simple shrug, "I don't know… I mean I do like playing and I want to continue but the idea of playing with others I just… I don't think I'm ready for it yet. I don't know… If I'll ever be ready but I also… I don't want him to be mad with me or disappointed."  
这次我能做的只有简单地耸耸肩，“我不知道……我的意思是，我喜欢演奏，也希望能继续下去，但和其他人一起演奏的想法，我只是……我觉得自己还没准备好。我不知道……我是否会有准备好的一天，但我也不想……让他对我生气或失望。”

"Well you have to explain that to him Shinji. I'm sure he isn't going to be mad or disappointed. I'm sure he'll understand, it's not an easy thing for anyone to do." She replied, "I'm sure he's just enthusiastic about his new student. Just… do what is right for you Shinji."  
“嗯，你得向他解释清楚，真嗣。我相信他不会生气或失望的。我确信他会理解的，这对任何人来说都不是件容易的事。”她回答道，“我敢肯定他对新学生充满热情。只是……做对你自己正确的事，真嗣。”

I nod and look back out of the window, "I… I'll try."  
我点点头，再次望向窗外，“我……我会试试。”

**Berlin – Early afternoon 柏林 —— 午后时分**

I set my coffee down on the table and give my recent edits another quick glance. I'm still not completely satisfied with what I have there but it'll have to do for now, it's something I can send to my publisher at the very least. I swap to my e-mail client and begin to write the e-mail.  
我将咖啡放在桌上，再次快速浏览了一遍最近的修改。我对现有的成果仍不完全满意，但眼下只能如此，至少这是可以发给出版商的内容。我切换到电子邮件客户端，开始撰写邮件。

Before I click on the send button I take a moment to prepare myself for what will come next. I ask myself if I really want to do this, if I really want to go through that again. The first time was just an accident, it was never supposed to happen. It shouldn't have happened but she… she persuaded me. Appealed to that stupid pride that lingers inside of me.  
在点击发送按钮之前，我稍作停顿，为即将到来的事情做好心理准备。我问自己是否真的想这么做，是否真的想再次经历这一切。第一次只是个意外，本不该发生的。它不应该发生，但她……她利用了我那愚蠢的骄傲，说服了我。

So I'll send this off and then they'd release the press release. I'd see it in the media with my pseudonym on it. After that I'll start getting the stupid requests to talk to the press, they'll tell me how good of an opportunity it'll be and how it'd be cool for people to meet the person behind the book. Just as with the first book I'll decline it all and stay anonymous. The publisher can handle all of that.  
所以我会把这稿子发出去，然后他们就会发布新闻稿。我会在媒体上看到我的笔名。之后，我就会开始收到那些愚蠢的请求，让我接受媒体采访，他们会告诉我这是个多好的机会，让人们认识书背后的作者有多酷。就像第一本书时一样，我会拒绝所有这些请求，保持匿名。出版社可以处理所有这些事。

It wouldn't be cool for any of them to meet the person behind the book because of who the person behind the book really is. I don't want to be known, I don't deserve to be known not after… not after everything I used to be. I'm trying to get away from all that and somehow I've ended up with this situation. A part of me wishes I had never been persuaded to take the first book to a publisher. Not people are going to expect things and… I know I'll eventually let them down. Just like I did before.  
他们中没有人会因为书背后的真实身份而觉得认识作者很酷。我不想被人知道，我不配被人知道，尤其是在……在经历了我曾经的一切之后。我试图远离那些过去，不知怎么的，我却陷入了这种境地。我的一部分希望自己从未被说服将第一本书交给出版社。现在人们会期待一些事情，而我……我知道我最终会让他们失望。就像我以前那样。

I sigh and look at the screen trying to force those thoughts out of my mind but I know now will come the other feelings. Those fears that I sometimes get when I look around in crowded spaces and I see other people looking at me. Of course they're not looking at me really but I can't help but think that. Third Impact had that effect on me, for a brief moment I was… we were all linked as one being. Of course I can't remember any of it and I know no one else can. Most of them don't even know it happened but I do and it's enough for me to worry.  
我叹了口气，盯着屏幕，试图将这些念头赶出脑海，但我知道接下来会有其他感觉涌上心头。那些我在拥挤的空间里环顾四周时偶尔会产生的恐惧，看到其他人似乎在盯着我。当然，他们并不是真的在看我，但我忍不住这么想。第三次冲击对我产生了那种影响，有那么一瞬间，我……我们所有人都被连接成一个存在。当然，我记不清任何细节，也知道其他人同样无法回忆。他们中的大多数甚至不知道这件事发生过，但我记得，这足以让我担忧。

What if one of them recognizes me? What if they figure out I was the one who nearly caused the Third Impact? I was the spiteful, hateful person that nearly pushed Shinji towards it. I was the abusive one who failed everyone and took it out on whoever was nearby. I was…  
如果他们中的某个人认出了我怎么办？如果他们发现我就是那个差点引发第三次冲击的人怎么办？我就是那个充满怨恨、几乎将真嗣推向深渊的人。我就是那个对所有人施暴、失败后迁怒于身边人的家伙。我就是……

I clench my hand into a fist and bring it down on my knee carefully enough that no one will see it but just enough for me to feel it. The short burst of pain brings me out of this spiral. I look back at the screen, I have an e-mail to send.  
我紧握拳头，小心翼翼地捶打在膝盖上，确保没人看到，但足以让我感受到。这短暂的疼痛让我从这种螺旋中抽离出来。我再次看向屏幕，有一封电子邮件要发送。

I'm about to hit the send button when my phone starts to vibrate on the table top. I contemplate ignoring it but a quick look at the caller ID and I grab it and answer immediately, "Hello!"  
我正要按下发送键，手机却在桌面上震动起来。我本想无视它，但瞥了一眼来电显示后，我立刻抓起手机接听，“喂！”

A few moments later a very soft and familiar voice is heard through the other end, _"Hello Asuka! I was just calling to see how you were?"_  
片刻后，电话那头传来一个柔和而熟悉的声音，“你好，明日香！我只是打电话来看看你怎么样了？”

I lean back in my seat and smile, "I'm doing fine! I'm actually just about to send out a sample of the next book to the publisher!"  
我靠在椅背上，微笑着说，“我很好！实际上，我正准备把下一本书的样稿发给出版社呢！”

_"Oh good!"_ She replies, _"So is it nearly finished?"_  
"哦太好了！" 她回答，"那是不是快完成了？"

"Mostly, I still need to work on some details for the ending and I'm not overly happy with a few of the scenes but it's good enough for them to look at. How come you're calling me now anyway? I thought you said you'd be in America around now?"  
"基本上，结尾的一些细节还需要打磨，有几个场景我也不太满意，但给他们看看足够了。话说回来，你现在怎么打电话给我？我记得你说过这时候会在美国的？"

There is another pause before she replies, _"I was but I'm actually at the airport about to board a plane for Germany. Would you like to meet up?"_  
她停顿了一下才回答，"我原本是的，但现在我在机场，正准备登机去德国。你想见个面吗？"

I feel myself frown at hearing her say that, my heart rate picks up just a little bit and I grip my laptops mouse a bit tighter in my hand, "Is there anyone with you?"  
听到她这么说，我不禁皱起了眉头，心跳微微加速，手中紧握着笔记本电脑的鼠标，问道：“你身边有人吗？”

_"No one, I am alone."  
“没有，我一个人。”_

"Will anyone know about it? Will you… will you be telling them where you are?"  
“会有人知道这件事吗？你会……你会告诉他们你在哪里吗？”

There is another pause and her voice comes back, it's easy to hear the disappointment, _"If you do not wish me to come then I will not. I will not inform them though and they still do not know I am in contact with you."_  
又是一阵沉默，她的声音再次传来，失望之情清晰可闻，“如果你不希望我来，那我就不来。但我不会告诉他们，他们仍然不知道我和你有联系。”

My frown deepens at hearing her disappointment, "No it's… I want to I just… you know the situations. I-I'm sorry I make you do that but you understand why don't you?"  
听到她的失望，我的眉头皱得更深了，“不，不是……我想要你来，只是……你知道情况的。我——我很抱歉让你这么做，但你明白为什么，对吧？”

_"I am your friend Asuka and I do understand. It will just be me and I promise they will not get to know unless it is something you want."  
“我是你的朋友，明日香，我理解。只有我会来，我保证他们不会知道，除非这是你想要的。”_

"Okay then! We'll meet up. When will you be here?"  
“好的！我们会面吧。你什么时候到？”

_"My flight will arrive late tonight in Germany, so tomorrow morning. Do you still live in the same place?"  
“我今晚的航班会晚点到德国，所以是明天早上。你还住在老地方吗？”_

I nod, "Yeah I do… I'll be in all day so just… let me know when you're on your way."  
我点头，“是的，我还住那儿……我整天都在，所以……你出发时告诉我一声。”

_"I will… Thank you Asuka, I look forward to seeing you."  
"我会……谢谢你，明日香，期待与你相见。"_

"I'll see you tomorrow, goodbye Rei."  
"明天见，再见，绫波。"

As I set my phone down my hands are trembling and I take a few moments to calm myself down from talking to Rei. I take a quick drink of my coffee and look back at the e-mail, I quickly finish it off and hit send my thoughts now turning towards seeing Rei tomorrow.  
当我放下手机时，双手颤抖着，我花了几分钟时间从与绫波的对话中平静下来。我迅速喝了一口咖啡，再次看向电子邮件，我迅速完成它并点击发送，现在我的思绪转向了明天与绫波的见面。

Rei is not one of, if not the only friend I actually have. Of all the people from my past life she is the only one I actually have any contact with. A rather bizarre turnaround for anyone who might have known me back then. I can just imagine what that younger Asuka would say to think that she was friends with that same girl she considered a rival that girl that she swore she hated.  
丽就算不是我唯一的，也是我真正拥有的朋友。在我前世的所有熟人中，她是唯一一个我还保持联系的。对于任何可能认识我过去的人来说，这真是一个相当奇怪的转变。我几乎可以想象，那个年轻的明日香会怎么想，她居然和那个她视为对手、发誓讨厌的女孩成了朋友。

Of course I didn't really hate Rei back then. I hated myself but I just took that out on everyone else. It didn't matter who it was be it Shinji, Misato, Rei or even Hikari. I just ended up hurting others because I couldn't deal with who I was. That's why I'm alone now, that's why I want to stay alone and not have anyone around me because I know if I even dare to let someone in I'll hurt them and maybe just maybe in the off chance I don't… they'll find out who I was and leave me.  
当然，那时候我并没有真正讨厌丽。我讨厌的是自己，只是把这种情绪发泄到了其他人身上。无论是真嗣、美里、丽还是甚至光，我都不在乎。我最终伤害了别人，只是因为我无法接受自己。这就是为什么我现在孤身一人，这就是为什么我想保持孤独，不想让任何人靠近我，因为我知道，如果我敢让某人进入我的生活，我会伤害他们，也许有那么一丝可能我不会伤害他们……但他们会发现我过去的真面目，然后离开我。

I know I'm being stupid. Rei has told me as much when I apologized to her the last time, I think that was apology one hundred and fifty two or something. Yet it doesn't stop me from remembering and thinking all of that and I know that tomorrow I'll apologize to her again.  
我知道我这样做很愚蠢。上次我向丽道歉时，她就这么告诉过我，我想那大概是第一百五十二次道歉了吧。然而，这并不能阻止我回忆和思考这一切，我知道明天我还会再次向她道歉。

I look back at the document, I know I'll do no more work today. My thoughts are all jumbled up, I need a distraction. I'll go browse that music shop I like and maybe go and look for a new game. Something to get away from my thoughts.  
我回头看了一眼文件，知道今天不会再工作了。思绪乱成一团，我需要分散注意力。去逛逛我喜欢的音乐店，或许再找款新游戏。总得摆脱这些念头。

**Tokyo-2 – Evening 东京-2 – 傍晚**

I enter the apartment and go straight into my room to put away my cello and get changed. As I do so Misato's words continue to ring in my ears and I start to wonder what I should do next. I try to separate what it is I think other people want from me and just what it is I want to do.  
我走进公寓，径直回到房间放下大提琴，换下衣服。过程中，美里的话依旧在耳边回响，我开始思考下一步该做什么。试图区分别人对我的期望和我真正想做的事。

It's a question I ask myself quite often, it's not as if I want to be like this. I don't want to be afraid of people but I am. I don't want to just go along with others to make them happy but I do. I won't want to be in the habit of putting my own happiness to the side so that I can hear some praise from others but I can't break that habit.  
这个问题我时常自问，并非我愿意如此。我不想害怕人群，但我确实害怕。我不想仅仅为了取悦他人而随波逐流，但我却这样做了。我不想养成牺牲自己的快乐以换取他人赞扬的习惯，但我无法打破这个习惯。

The problem is even if I do try to do something for myself I start to question it. When it comes to taking lessons on the cello I wonder who am I really doing this for? Is it just something to make Misato happy, so that she can see me being out and about and doing something? Is it so that she'll say she is proud of me?  
问题是，即使我尝试为自己做些什么，我也会开始质疑。当涉及到学习大提琴的课程时，我会想，我究竟是为了谁在做这件事？是为了让美里高兴，让她看到我外出并做些什么吗？是为了让她说她为我感到骄傲吗？

I let out a sigh of frustration with myself. I know Misato would be proud of me no matter what I chose. I'm like her... well I am her son now I guess. Shortly after Third Impact she made it official, she adopted me and become my mother. I just... the way her face lit up when she suggested it... how could I have said no?  
我无奈地叹了口气。我知道无论我选择什么，美里都会为我感到骄傲。我像她一样...好吧，现在我是她的儿子了。在第三次冲击后不久，她正式收养了我，成为了我的母亲。我只是...当她提出这个建议时，她脸上的光彩...我怎么能拒绝呢？

Even the story of why I play the cello is frustrating. I only started playing it because of my teacher and guardian at the time suggesting it to me. He thought it'd be good for me to learn to play an instrument, said it'd help me develop some confidence and told me an appreciation for music is always a good thing.  
就连我为何拉大提琴的故事也令人沮丧。我之所以开始拉大提琴，只是因为当时我的老师兼监护人向我推荐了它。他认为学习乐器对我有好处，能帮助我建立自信，并告诉我欣赏音乐总是件好事。

Strangely enough when I think about it, it was actually me who picked out the cello. I can remember it quite clearly, we were in the music shop and looking at the variety of instruments. Drums, guitars, piano, violins and so much more. Something about the cello appealed to me though. The shopkeeper gave us a demonstration and I just... I become attached to it. I took lessons and it did make my teacher happy that I was doing something.  
奇怪的是，当我回想起来，实际上是我自己选择了大提琴。我记得很清楚，当时我们在乐器店里，看着各种各样的乐器。鼓、吉他、钢琴、小提琴等等。但不知为何，大提琴吸引了我。店主为我们演示了一番，我...我就对它产生了依恋。我上了课，这让我的老师很高兴，因为我有所行动。

I did enjoying playing it though. I know deep down I wasn't just doing it for him but because I wanted to. I liked it and yes, I did want him to be proud of me and say that but I liked playing. I liked the way I could lose myself in what I was playing. I liked exploring the range of music composed for it and even trying to compose my own.  
不过，我的确喜欢拉大提琴。我知道我内心深处不仅仅是为了他，而是因为我自己想拉。我喜欢它，是的，我希望他能为我感到骄傲，说出来，但我喜欢拉琴本身。我喜欢沉浸在自己演奏的音乐中。我喜欢探索为大提琴创作的音乐范围，甚至尝试自己作曲。

I let out another sigh as I sit on the edge of my bed. I look down at the cello and go back to thinking about the lesson. My instructor had been a nice man. He was a lot younger than I expected. He did actually tell me that he also worked with a number of students and that I would fit right in. I couldn't help myself but say yes as soon as he asked if I'd be interested.  
我坐在床边，又叹了口气。低头看着大提琴，思绪又回到了那堂课上。我的老师是个好人，比我想象中年轻许多。他确实告诉我，他带过不少学生，我加入正合适。他一问我对这事儿感不感兴趣，我就忍不住答应了。

I couldn't help myself but he seemed so happy and enthusiastic about it and he offered praise. I'm like some dumb moth crashing into a lightbulb. I know I'm not ready for that sort of thing yet, I'm too scared to meet other people but I can't really explain that to him. How can I explain that I'm part of the reason Third Impact happened and that now everyone terrifies me?  
我情不自禁，他看起来那么开心和热情，还给予了我赞扬。我就像只愚蠢的飞蛾，一头撞向灯泡。我知道自己还没准备好面对这些，我害怕见其他人，但又无法向他解释。我怎么能告诉他，我是第三次冲击发生的原因之一，现在每个人都让我感到恐惧呢？

The worst thing about it is that deep down if it wasn't the fear of it I do want to do that. I want to be part of that group and I want to play cello with them. I want to be part of productions with audiences coming to see us play and I want to write and compose but I'm too damn messed up to admit or do anything about it.  
最糟糕的是，内心深处，如果不是因为恐惧，我确实想这么做。我想成为那个团队的一员，想和他们一起拉大提琴。我想参与有观众来观看的演出，想创作和作曲，但我太混乱了，无法承认或采取任何行动。

I just wish I could move forward! Every day since Third Impact has been some stupid struggle and I'm sick of it. I'm fed up of being afraid of people. I'm fed up of knowing I have no reason to be. I'm sick of having those old feelings of uselessness or feeling that people are going to abandon me. It isn't fair, none of it is fair! I just... I just want to be happy, don't I deserve that?  
我真希望能向前迈进！自从第三次冲击以来，每一天都是些愚蠢的挣扎，我受够了。我厌倦了对人们感到恐惧。我厌倦了明知自己没有理由这样。我厌倦了那些无用感或觉得人们会抛弃我的旧情绪。这不公平，这一切都不公平！我只是……我只是想快乐，难道我不配吗？

I can't help but shake my head sympathetically as I watch Shinji slip into his room and close the door behind him. I take this chance to go into my own room so that I can get changed into something more comfortable.  
我不禁同情地摇了摇头，看着真嗣溜进自己的房间并关上门。我趁机回到自己的房间，以便换上更舒适的衣服。

These past few years have been tough for those of us who were at the center of what happened. I know it's been especially tough on Shinji though. I can't even begin to imagine just what it is he is going through. He literally had the fate of the world in his hands at one point and for a brief few seconds it almost went. God only knows what it must feel like to be him.  
过去几年对我们这些身处事件中心的人来说很艰难。我知道这对真嗣尤其艰难。我甚至无法想象他正在经历什么。他曾一度掌握着世界的命运，有那么几秒钟几乎要失败了。只有上帝知道他是什么感觉。

Shinji has made some progress over the years though. We suffered a slight setback when Asuka left. He was heartbroken to see her go but it wasn't entirely unexpected. Yet it was a shame, I had hoped that maybe they would realize their feelings for each other and something would happen. Still maybe it was for the best, maybe the chance for them to be apart and find themselves will help them more. I just wish she hadn't cut off contact completely from us all. I'm sure she is alright but I don't know where she is now or anything.  
这些年，真嗣确实有了些进步。但当明日香离开时，我们遭遇了小小的挫折。看到她离去，他心碎了，虽然这并非完全出乎意料。可惜的是，我曾希望他们能意识到彼此的感情，或许会发生些什么。不过，也许这样最好，让他们分开并找到自我，可能会更有帮助。我只希望她没有完全切断与我们所有人的联系。我确信她没事，只是不知道她现在在哪里。

Shinji did seem to get over it eventually though. I don't know if he still thinks of her, I imagine he does. We talk about her from time to time, wonder what she is up to and if she is alright. I'm careful to not tease him about her. I enjoy a joke but I've come to realize that there are some jokes that shouldn't be made.  
不过，真嗣最终似乎还是走出来了。我不知道他是否还会想起她，我猜他会。我们偶尔会谈论她，想知道她在做什么，是否安好。我小心地不拿她来取笑他。我喜欢开玩笑，但我逐渐意识到有些玩笑是不该开的。

As I slip my suit jacket off I hear my phone start to ring. I let out a laugh as I pick it up and see Ritsuko's name on the caller ID, right on cue Rits.  
当我脱下西装外套时，听到手机开始响了。我笑着拿起手机，看到是律子打来的，真是准时啊，律子。

"Hey Rits! Calling to check in on us, are you?"  
"嘿，Rits！打电话来关心我们，是吗？"

I hear her let out a laugh on the other end, _"I just wanted to make you didn't blow your big meeting today, I know it was an important one."_  
我听到她在电话那头笑出声来，“我只是想确认你今天的大会没搞砸，我知道那很重要。”

She can't see me but I pout, "You have that little faith in me huh?"  
她看不见我，但我还是撅起了嘴，“你就这么不相信我啊？”

_"Actually I have complete faith in you which is why I know I can make a joke about it. So how did it go?"  
“实际上，我对你完全有信心，所以我才敢开这个玩笑。那么，情况如何？”_

I shrug, "About as well as could be expected for a first meeting on this sort of subject. A lot of people introducing themselves and telling us why they're important. A lot of discussion about the objectives on the meeting followed by setting estimated dates on when objectives should be confirmed by. This was followed up by discussing the arranging of further meetings between different departments to confirm more dates for meetings. A load of bureaucratic bullshit really."  
我耸耸肩，“第一次在这种话题上见面，情况还算符合预期。很多人自我介绍，告诉我们他们为什么重要。会议目标讨论了很多，然后设定了确认目标的预计日期。接着讨论了安排不同部门之间进一步会议以确认更多会议日期的事宜。基本上就是一堆官僚主义的废话。”

She lets out a chuckle, _"So no word on whether or not you guys will be allowed into Tokyo-3 or what will happen to the Emergence Facilities?"_  
她轻笑一声，“那么，关于你们是否能进入东京-3，或者紧急设施会发生什么，还没有消息吗？”

"Nope, nothing yet. It seems we have some competition when it comes to wanting to go back into Tokyo-3. Each one has different goals. Some want to do a full sweep, take as much technology from NERV that they can and build from it. Some think that they should go in, take what they can and destroy it all. Reuse the land for housing or whatever. We're somewhere in the middle."  
"不，还没有动静。看来我们在重返第三新东京市这件事上遇到了一些竞争。每个人的目标都不尽相同。有些人想要彻底搜刮一番，尽可能从 NERV 那里获取技术，并在此基础上发展。有些人则认为应该进去，能拿多少拿多少，然后将其全部摧毁。将土地重新用于住宅或其他用途。我们则处于两者之间。"

_"Well that's surprising, I'd have thought you'd want to see the entire thing destroyed."  
"这倒是挺意外的，我本以为你会希望看到整个设施被彻底摧毁。"_

I shrug, "Initially I did but after talking with Maya and some of the others they persuaded me that some of it might be of use to us. We had some pretty advanced technology and it'd be a shame for it to go to waste if we can help people. Also in the back of my mind I keep thinking… what if… well…"  
我耸耸肩，"起初我确实这么想，但和真希波以及其他一些人交谈后，他们说服了我，认为其中一些技术或许对我们有用。我们拥有相当先进的技术，如果能够帮助人们，让它白白浪费就太可惜了。而且在我内心深处，我一直在想……万一……嗯……"

_"They're gone Misato, there won't be anymore_." He voice comes through loud and clear and is in a very stern tone, _"The Angels, SEELE… it's done."_  
"他们已经消失了，美里，不会再有了。" 他的声音清晰而严厉，"使徒，SEELE……一切都结束了。"

I let out a sigh, I know she is right of course but I still feel a need to say something, "I know that but… say someone tries to carry on the things they did or… I don't know we messed something up and an Angel like thing appears. Maybe… just maybe having some of the heavier stuff around would be useful."  
我叹了口气，我知道她是对的，但我仍然觉得需要说些什么，"我知道，但是……如果有人试图继续他们所做的事情，或者……我不知道我们搞砸了什么，然后出现了类似使徒的东西。也许……只是也许，保留一些重型装备会有用。"

_"And how exactly would you define what is or isn't the right sort of stuff? It's one thing when it might benefit mankind, you're right our medical tech was far beyond what we have now as was our energy production tech but the military stuff… the Eva's…"  
"那你究竟如何定义什么是或不是合适的装备呢？当它可能造福人类时，你是对的，我们的医疗技术远超现在，能源生产技术也是如此，但军事装备……EVA……"_

"I know…" "我知道……"

_"Do you want my opinion?"  
"你想听我的意见吗？"_

"Always." "一直都想。"

_"Destroy the lot of it Misato, get rid of it all and use the land for something else. The medical tech… the energy production all relied on what we got from the FAR. Keep the Emergence Support facilities open and just let NERV and SEELE go, what happened… it can't happen again, what they need is gone so we should just get rid of the rest."  
“全部摧毁吧，美里，把它们都清除掉，用这块地做点别的。那些医疗技术……能源生产全都依赖我们从 FAR 获得的东西。保持紧急支援设施开放，让 NERV 和 SEELE 就这样消失，发生过的事……不能再重演，他们所需的一切已不复存在，所以我们应该把剩下的也一并清除。”_

"Destroy everything?" I ask in surprise, "Even the MAGI there?"  
“全部摧毁？”我惊讶地问，“连那里的 MAGI 系统也包括在内吗？”

_"Especially the Tokyo-3 MAGI, if there is anything left of it." She replies, "That's… what I'd do anyway."  
“尤其是第三新东京市的 MAGI，如果它还有什么残留的话。”她回答道，“无论如何，这是我……会采取的做法。”_

"I don't know… if I could do that. The medical tech… it could help a lot of people…"  
"我不知道……我能否做到。这项医疗技术……它可以帮助很多人……"

_"I know and that's why you're the one who'll make the decision Misato and not me. You… always knew the right way to do things."  
"我明白，这也是为什么由美里你来做决定，而不是我。你……总是知道正确的方法。"_

I smile faintly at hearing her words, "We'll see what happens when it's all documented. It could be that there is nothing of use there at all. It's been years since anyone actually went into the ruins but… I think it's worth looking at and I think it should be my people."  
听到她的话，我微微一笑，"我们会看到一切被记录下来后的结果。可能那里根本没有什么有用的东西。已经很多年没有人真正进入过那些废墟了，但是……我认为值得一看，而且我认为应该由我的人去。"

_"I'm sure it will be."_ She pauses for a moment, _"So how did things go for Shinji anyway?"_  
"我相信会的。" 她顿了一下，"那么，真嗣那边情况怎么样？"

Another sigh escapes me, "I think they went well. He seemed to enjoy the lesson but…"  
我又叹了口气，"我觉得挺好的。他看起来挺喜欢这堂课的，但是……"

_"He was scared of being recognized?"  
"他害怕被认出来吗？"_

"Yeah…" I confirm to her.  
"是啊…" 我向她确认道。

_"That's understandable, I think it's something we're all dealing with in our own way."  
"这可以理解，我想这是我们都在以自己的方式应对的事情。"_

"I'm just worried about him Rits. I don't want him to feel like he has to do this for me or for anyone else I want him to do it for himself not because I said it might be a good idea."  
"我只是担心他，Rits。我不希望他觉得必须为了我或任何人去做这件事，我希望他是为了自己，而不是因为我提过这可能是个好主意。"

_"It's entirely possible that Shinji doesn't even know himself."_ Ritsuko says, _"He probably wants to make you happy but he also enjoys playing the instrument. Our reports on him indicated that he was a natural talent with it and his teacher even said that Shinji would spend a lot of time practicing when he was younger."_  
“完全有可能真嗣自己都不清楚。” 律子说道，“他可能想让你开心，但他也喜欢弹奏乐器。我们的报告指出他在音乐方面天赋异禀，连他的老师都说真嗣小时候会花很多时间练习。”

Hearing her say that lightens my heart somewhat, "So he does enjoy it?"  
听到她这么说，我心里稍微轻松了些，“所以他确实喜欢弹奏？”

Ritsuko chuckles, "_I don't think you get to be the level Shinji was at without enjoying it. Just give him time and encouragement. I'm sure he'll figure things out for himself. He said the lesson went alright though?"_  
律子轻笑道，“我不认为能达到真嗣那样的水平会不喜欢。给他一些时间和鼓励，我相信他自己会想明白的。他说课上得还不错，对吧？”

"Yeah." I nod my head, "Well… He did mention that the instructor suggested at one point that Shinji join a group of them who all play."  
"嗯。" 我点点头，"呃… 他确实提到过，教练曾建议他加入一个他们一起玩的团队。"

_"And Shinji immediately said yes didn't he?"_ Ritsuko asks with some hint of amusement in her voice.  
"然后真嗣立刻就答应了，对吧？" 律子带着一丝戏谑的语气问道。"

"Of course." I confirm to her, "He didn't want to disappoint his instructor."  
"当然。" 我向她确认，"他不想让教练失望。"

_"Well that's just a part of who Shinji is. Maybe it'll be good for him in the long run though, he can always stop if it's too much."  
"嗯，那只是真嗣性格的一部分。不过从长远来看，这对他也许是件好事，如果感到太过沉重，他随时可以停下来。"_

"Maybe… I just don't want him to get hurt or feel he has to do things to please others. I want him to know he has a loving home and friends who won't abandon him."  
"也许吧……我只是不想让他受伤，或者觉得必须做些什么来取悦别人。我希望他知道，他有一个充满爱的家和不会抛弃他的朋友。"

_"Deep down he will know that but it's not exactly easy to break those old habits. It's something I think we're all learning but I'm sure he'll be alright."  
"他内心深处会明白的，但打破那些旧习惯并不容易。我认为我们都在学习这一点，但我确信他会没事的。"_

"I hope so… I really do." I stare down at the ground, "So how was your day anyway?"  
"我也希望如此……我真的这么希望。" 我低头盯着地面，"那么，你今天过得怎么样？"

_"Not too bad, I have a lot of marking to do this evening and I need to plan for next week's lessons but nothing I can't do. Still… if I'm being honest I do understand what Shinji is going through. I keep on thinking when I see the students and their parents that maybe one of them will recognize me… It's not as if the Akagi name is hidden away."  
"还不错，今晚我有很多批改作业的工作要做，还得为下周的课做准备，不过这些我都能应付。尽管如此……说实话，我确实理解真嗣正在经历的事情。每次看到学生和他们的家长，我都会想，也许他们会认出我来……毕竟，赤木这个姓氏并不是什么秘密。"_

I nod again, "I know… It's the same for Katsuragi. I have that feeling too from time to time but it won't happen."  
我再次点头，"我知道……对于葛城也是一样。我有时也会有那种感觉，但那不会发生的。"

_"No it won't."_ She reassures me, _"Anyway I'd better go. Maya is due back any minute. Good luck to the both of you. We should arrange something soon."_  
"不，不会的。" 她安慰我，"无论如何，我最好走了。玛雅随时可能回来。祝你们俩好运。我们应该尽快安排点什么。"

"Yeah… I'd like that. Goodbye Rits."  
"是啊……我很期待。再见，立夏。"

I can't suppress the smile on my face as I glance down at the forms in my hand once more and walk through the wonderful streets of Berlin. It's been almost six months since I arrived in this country and this city I now call home.  
当我再次低头看着手中的表格，走在柏林美丽的街道上，我无法抑制脸上的笑容。自从我来到这个国家，这座我现在称之为家的城市，已经快六个月了。

Most of my time is spent working for Fuyutsuki. I assist him in an array of administrative tasks from filing basic progress reports for his staff, taking notes during meetings he is in, I arrange appointments for him and compose e-mails for him. It's not overly difficult work but I enjoy it.  
我的大部分时间都花在为冬月先生工作上。我协助他处理一系列行政事务，从为他手下员工整理基本进度报告，到在他参加会议时做笔记，我还为他安排预约并代写电子邮件。这份工作并不特别困难，但我乐在其中。

Since I arrived Fuyutsuki has been careful to slowly educate me on the state of this world since I was last in it. He explained to me exactly what has happened since the Third Impact and the little ways in which the world has changed. He told me what it was he now did and also informed me of the status of organizations such as NERV and the group who handled me, SEELE.  
自从我来到这里，冬月先生一直小心翼翼地逐步向我介绍自上次我离开后这个世界的变化。他详细地向我解释了第三次冲击以来发生的一切，以及世界在细微之处发生的改变。他告诉我他现在的工作，并告知我诸如 NERV 和负责我的组织 SEELE 等机构的状态。

It seems that after Third Impact and people returned information was released to the public and world governments about SEELE and their role in the whole thing. Names were kept away from the public eye but it was enough that the world knew the truth about who was the true enemy. If anything I was pleased to learn that the people who were a part of NERV were alive and well.  
似乎在第三次冲击之后，随着人们回归，有关 SEELE 及其在整个事件中角色的信息被公开给公众和世界各国政府。虽然具体姓名未被公开，但足以让世界知道谁是真正的敌人。令我欣慰的是，我得知参与 NERV 的人们都安然无恙。

There are certain subjects I have dared to not ask about as of yet. These particular things have been the subject of numerous nightmares I've experienced since returning. I dare not ask what happened to Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami or even the other pilot who was there in my short stay. I assume from what Fuyutsuki told me about former NERV personnel being alive and well that they are okay but I don't dare go any deeper than that.  
有些话题我至今未敢触及。自从归来后，这些特定的事情就成了我无数噩梦的主题。我不敢询问真嗣·碇、绫波零，甚至是我在短暂停留期间见过的那位驾驶员发生了什么。我从冬月那里得知前 NERV 人员都安然无恙，所以我推测他们应该没事，但我并不敢深入探究。

Maybe… Maybe one day I'll work up the nerve to find out but not until I know I'm ready for it. I'm still trying to adjust to this life, one I didn't think I'd ever have. I've been given a gift, a chance to explore so many things I never knew before.  
也许……也许有一天我会鼓起勇气去了解，但前提是我确定自己已经准备好了。我仍在努力适应这种生活，一种我从未想过会拥有的生活。我被赋予了一份礼物，一个探索我以前从未知晓的众多事物的机会。

Music had of course been my first port of call. I've been able to explore numerous eras and genres beyond the classical material they forced me to listen to. The playlist Kodama gave me was a huge benefit. I took notes of each artist to listen to moments and pieces I enjoyed. It seems she put a lot of work into making that playlist, managing to cover a variety of genres, eras, artists from around the world.  
音乐自然成了我的首选。我得以探索众多时代和流派，超越了他们强迫我听的古典音乐。儿玉给我的播放列表带来了巨大的帮助。我记录了每个艺术家，以便聆听我喜欢的时刻和作品。看来她在这份播放列表上下了很多功夫，成功涵盖了世界各地的各种流派、时代和艺术家。

With my background in classical music and playing the piano I did find myself drawn towards the progressive genres of rock. I enjoy the longer tracks and slightly complex arrangements these songs offer. I also like how they made a habit of utilizing a wide array of instruments in their songs although admittedly they could be a bit obtuse lyrically although I suppose knowing the way I speak is probably another reason that the genre appeals to me.  
我自幼学习古典音乐并弹奏钢琴，因此对摇滚乐中的前卫流派情有独钟。我喜欢这些歌曲提供的较长曲目和略显复杂的编排。我也欣赏他们在歌曲中广泛运用各种乐器的习惯，尽管不可否认，歌词有时可能略显晦涩，但我想，这或许也是该流派吸引我的另一个原因，毕竟我的言谈方式也与之相仿。

Beyond that I have found I don't have much of an affinity for sports. I appreciate what various athletes and sports stars are capable of, I just don't really enjoy watching them. In fact I don't find myself watching much television at all nor have I had the chance to see a movie in a theater yet. I would like to but I don't know what it is I would watch.  
除此之外，我发现我对体育并没有太多兴趣。我虽然敬佩各类运动员和体育明星的才能，但并不热衷于观看他们的比赛。事实上，我很少看电视，也从未有机会在影院观看电影。我希望能有机会，但不知该选择什么影片。

I have also found that I quite enjoy the human act of cooking too. In my previous life I did not get an opportunity to partake of this particular pastime. As an Angel I didn't require as much food as a regular human would and being under the care of SEELE meant any meals were carefully monitored and structured to provide what my body needed. It was usually bland and functional,  
我还发现，我非常享受烹饪这一人类活动。在前世，我未曾有机会体验这一爱好。作为天使，我不需要像普通人那样进食，而 SEELE 的照料意味着我的每一餐都经过精心监控和安排，以满足身体所需。那些食物通常平淡无味，仅具功能性，

Unfortunately learning to cook came with some dangers. There had been one incident involving an errant pan and my apartment nearly burning down and another in which some undercooked meat had given me a night I don't wish to experience ever again. Yet I suppose it is a part of the learning process, I will not be the first nor the last to under-prepare meat like that.  
不幸的是，学习烹饪伴随着一些危险。曾有一次，一个失控的平底锅差点让我的公寓化为灰烬，还有一次，未煮熟的肉让我经历了一夜，我再也不想体验。然而，我想这是学习过程的一部分，我不会是第一个也不会是最后一个那样准备不足的人。

I turn onto another street and see a small coffee shop come into view. I decide that it would be a shame to go straight back to my apartment now and this place looks appealing so think it'd be a good idea to head inside and grab something to drink and relax. I clutch the forms I'm holding tightly in my hand and walk down the street.  
我拐进另一条街道，看到一家小咖啡馆映入眼帘。我觉得现在直接回公寓太可惜了，这家店看起来很吸引人，所以我认为进去喝点东西放松一下是个好主意。我紧紧抓着手里拿着的表格，沿着街道走去。

The forms I'm holding are application forms to help me on my first step towards become a music teacher. Fuyutsuki had given me the idea a few weeks ago after hearing me play the piano. He had at first suggested I find overs to play with but admittedly I do not think I would mix well with a group at this time and being honest being in larger groups scares me somewhat.  
我手里拿着的是成为音乐教师的第一步所需的申请表。几周前，冬月给了我这个建议，当时他听我弹钢琴。他起初建议我找人一起演奏，但老实说，我不认为自己现在能很好地融入一个团体，而且说实话，大型团体让我有些害怕。

Yet the more I thought about it the more I realized that one on one situations might be better suited to me and I would like, if anything, to share what I have and maybe inspire others. Fuyutsuki liked my idea and helped me find a means to getting the correct qualifications.  
然而，我越是思考，越意识到一对一的情况可能更适合我，我希望能分享我所拥有的，或许还能激励他人。冬月喜欢我的想法，并帮助我找到了获得正确资格的途径。

I look at the forms again, there are still a few things to fill out on there. My name and address are at the top but there are other questions on there. How long have I been playing? My inspirations and prior qualifications. Nothing complex but I'm very eager to fill it in and get this all started.  
我又看了看表格，还有一些地方需要填写。我的名字和地址在顶部，但还有其他问题。我玩了多久？我的灵感来源和之前的资格。虽然不复杂，但我非常渴望填写并开始这一切。

I continue to walk forward my eyes still focused on the paper until finally I hit something, not something but someone. I feel a sharp pain in my head as I connect with them, I hear a loud scream from them as I'm sent falling onto my backside and the form flies out of my hand.  
我继续前行，眼睛仍紧盯着那张纸，直到最终撞上了什么，不是东西，而是某个人。我感到头部一阵剧痛，随着与他们的碰撞，我听到一声尖叫，自己被撞倒在地，表格也从手中飞了出去。

I rub my head with my hand and hear an angry voice yell at me, "Idiot! Weren't you watching where you were going?"  
我用手揉着头，听到一个愤怒的声音对我吼道：“白痴！你没看路吗？”

I shake my head and my vision starts to come back to me, the pain however does not subside, "I apologize… are you hurt?"  
我摇了摇头，视线开始恢复，但疼痛并未减轻，“对不起……你受伤了吗？”

I slowly start to get to my feet and hold out a hand to help the fallen girl to her feet.  
我慢慢站起身，伸出一只手帮助那位摔倒的女孩站起来。

"Yeah well… just be more careful! Could have broken something!" She remarks as she gets to her feet and picks up a small laptop bag she dropped. I take a step back and for the first time I actually see the girl I walked into.  
"哎，好吧……小心点！差点就弄坏了什么东西！" 她一边说，一边站起身来，捡起她掉落的小笔记本包。我后退一步，第一次真正看清了那个我撞到的女孩。

Almost immediately I feel my eyes get wide with fear. I feel that sickly feeling in the pit of my stomach as I take in all of her features. Her shoulder length red hair, her bright blue eyes, a soft but angered expression and a thin scar over her left eye. She's older than I remember seeing her but there is no mistaking who this is.  
几乎立刻，我感到恐惧让我的眼睛瞪大。我感受到胃里那种恶心的感觉，当我注意到她所有的特征时。她齐肩的红发，明亮的蓝眼睛，柔和但带着怒意的表情，以及左眼上方的一道细疤。她比我记忆中看到的要年长，但毫无疑问，这就是她。

"N-No…" I stutter, "I-Impossible…"  
"不-不可能……" 我结巴着说，"这-这不可能……"

She looks at me in confusion, "What? Never saw a pissed off redhead before?"  
她困惑地看着我，“什么？没见过生气的红发女孩吗？”

I shake my head, "N-No… I…I'm sorry… I have to go!"  
我摇摇头，“不，不……我……我很抱歉……我得走了！”

I immediately turn around and run away from her as fast as I can. I don't stop to look back at any point until I'm several streets away. I don't know if she called after me or if she recognizes me, all I know is I have to get away from her. I have to get away from Asuka Langley Soryu, The Second Child.  
我立刻转身，尽可能快地逃离她。直到跑过几条街，我都没有回头看一眼。我不知道她是否在后面叫我，或者是否认出了我，我只知道我必须远离她。我必须远离明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。

### Chapter 3: Lost Boy  
第三章：迷失的男孩  

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early Morning 柏林 – 清晨时分**

The nightmares came back last night. The ones in which I get found out, the ones in which the fragile social bonds I've made with people are shattered and everyone turns there back on me. The ones where I wake up crying knowing that if that did happen I'd deserve it.  
昨晚噩梦又回来了。那些梦里我被揭穿，那些梦里我与人建立的脆弱社交关系被粉碎，每个人都背弃我。那些梦里我哭着醒来，知道如果真发生了那种事，我活该。

I didn't sleep for the rest of the night, from four o'clock onwards I've been awake sitting in my front room. I tried doing some further editing to my book, that didn't happen so instead I put on a game instead. I spent the majority of the morning scoring goals past any and all opposition as I try to put what happened yesterday out of my mind.  
那一夜我再也没睡，从四点开始就一直醒着坐在客厅。我试着继续编辑我的书，但没做成，于是改玩起了游戏。整个早上我大部分时间都在攻破所有对手的防线，试图把昨天发生的事抛诸脑后。

Why did he run away from me like that? Did he know who I was? Does he know what I did? That shouldn't be possible though, I know logically it shouldn't be possible. I've spoken about it with Rei in the past, He... he has the same concerns but no one knows who we are. If they do they just know we were the Evangelion pilots who helped save the world.  
他为什么那样从我身边逃开？他知道我是谁吗？他知道我做过什么吗？这按理说不应该啊，我理智上知道这不应该。我以前和丽讨论过，他……他也有同样的担忧，但没人知道我们是谁。如果他们知道，也只晓得我们是帮助拯救世界的 EVA 驾驶员。

Yet that annoying awkward fear remains. It doesn't help that I'm seeing Rei today either. It isn't her fault, I know she is my friend but I can't help but worry each time I see her that it will be the time that our friendship is revealed to be nothing but a fraud. That she comes here with the others to tell me how much they hate me. To tell me how disgusting I am and that I deserve to be alone and abandoned. To bring up all those things I did in my past and throw it in my face. I'd deserve it aswell wouldn't I?  
然而那种恼人的尴尬恐惧依旧挥之不去。今天还要见丽，这更让我不安。我知道这不是她的错，她是我朋友，但我每次见她都不禁担心，我们的友谊会不会被揭穿只是个骗局。她会不会和其他人一起来告诉我他们有多恨我，告诉我我有多恶心，活该孤独被抛弃。会不会把我过去的所作所为都翻出来，甩在我脸上。我也该受这些，不是吗？

I shake my head and force those thoughts away. That isn't going to happen, Rei is my friend now and everything is in the past. She's told me numerous times, even with some annoyance that I'm forgiven for how I acted back then.  
我摇摇头，强迫自己抛开这些念头。不会发生的，丽现在是我的朋友，一切都过去了。她多次甚至有些不耐烦地告诉我，我当时的所作所为她已经原谅了。

It's all that guys fault, if he hadn't had ran away then I wouldn't be like this right now. No, that isn't true. I'd be like this anyway, he's just made it more prominent. I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I look rough. I can see the bags under my eyes and I know no amount of make-up will hide them. I've tried to make an effort but I know Rei will see through it. She always does, it's who Rei is.  
都怪那家伙，如果不是他逃走了，我现在就不会这样。不，这不是真的。无论如何我都会这样，他只是让这一切更加明显了。我从镜子里瞥了自己一眼，看起来很憔悴。眼下的黑眼圈清晰可见，我知道再多的化妆品也遮不住。我试着打扮了一下，但我知道丽会看穿这一切。她总是能看穿，这就是丽。

I finally open the door ao reveal Rei standing on the other side. She's a far cry from the dour girl I knew so many years ago. She's looking upwards, a faint smile on her face and wearing a short red skirt, complemented by a black top with a white jacket over it. In one of her hands is a bag that I recognize from one of the nearby cafes.  
我终于打开门，露出站在另一边的丽。她与我多年前认识的那个阴郁女孩相去甚远。她抬头望向天空，脸上带着淡淡的微笑，穿着一条红色短裙，搭配黑色上衣和白色夹克。她手中提着一个袋子，我认出那是附近一家咖啡馆的。

"Hello Asuka." She announces, "I brought lunch if that is alright?"  
“你好，明日香。”她宣布道，“我带了午餐，可以吗？”

I laugh and step aside to let her in, "Of course, come on in!"  
我笑着侧身让她进来，“当然可以，快请进！”

I watch her as she enters the apartment and I allow myself a smile as well. I feel happy to see the life that now exists within Rei. It's good to see she finally has the chance to have a life. I follow her through into the kitchen and watch as she places the bag up on one of the counters. I'm interested in seeing what it is she has bought, moments later she pulls out two boxes each one filled with luscious smelling pancakes.  
我看着她走进公寓，也忍不住微笑起来。看到丽现在有了生活的气息，我感到很高兴。很高兴她终于有机会过上自己的生活。我跟着她走进厨房，看着她把袋子放在其中一个台面上。我很好奇她买了什么，不一会儿，她从袋子里拿出两个盒子，每个盒子里都装满了香气扑鼻的煎饼。

My mouth starts to water at the sight of them and I step forward. Rei sees this and smiles and immediately turns herself around and pulls me into a warm but tight hug.  
看到这些煎饼，我的口水开始分泌，我向前迈了一步。丽看到了，微笑着立刻转过身来，给了我一个温暖而紧实的拥抱。

"I've missed you Asuka!" “我好想你，明日香！”

I laugh and return the hug, "I've miss you too Rei, it's been quite a while hasn't it?"  
我笑着回抱她，“我也想你，丽，真是好久不见了，对吧？”

She releases me from the hug, "Almost a year since we last met."  
她松开拥抱，“我们上次见面差不多快一年了。”

"Yeah." I say guiltily, "How was your flight?"  
“是啊。”我内疚地说，“你的航班怎么样？”

She shrugs slightly, "It was okay. I arrived late last night so I was able to get a good amount of sleep."  
她微微耸肩，“还不错。我昨晚很晚才到，所以睡了个好觉。”

"I'm glad." I reply as I go into one of my kitchen cupboards to grab some plates for our pancakes, "These smell delicious Rei."  
“那就好。”我一边回答，一边走进厨房打开橱柜拿盘子准备装我们的煎饼，“这些闻起来真香，丽。”

"They do, I was wondering what to do for lunch and saw a place selling these. I have become quite a fan of pancakes whilst being in America, I am eager to try these."  
“确实很香，我正想着午餐吃什么，就看到有地方卖这个。在美国这段时间，我成了煎饼的忠实粉丝，很期待尝试这些。”

I am as well and I get out some plates and cutlery for us. The pancakes are plain but the café Rei got them from supplied her with a variety of spreads to try with them. Rei reaches for the strawberry jam for hers, I go for the classic chocolate spread for my first one.  
我也一样，于是我拿出一些盘子和餐具为我们准备。这些煎饼是原味的，但 Rei 买它们的咖啡店提供了多种酱料供我们尝试。Rei 选择了草莓酱，而我则选择了经典的巧克力酱作为我的第一份。

"So how come you're here in Germany, I thought the plan was to travel America for a few more weeks?"  
“那么你怎么会来德国呢？我记得计划是还要在美国旅行几周的？”

"it was but I realized halfway through the trip that it was coming up to a year since I last saw you, so I sought to rectify that."  
“确实如此，但我在旅途中途意识到，自从上次见你已经快一年了，所以我决定来弥补这一点。”

I almost choke in shock, "Y-You... Rei that's too much money just to come and visit me!"  
我几乎被惊得噎住，“你...丽，这钱太多了，就为了来看我！”

She shrugs again, "I do not think so. As I said it has almost been a year and I think the chances of you visiting me and Japan are somewhat slim."  
她又耸了耸肩，“我不这么认为。正如我所说，已经快一年了，我觉得你来日本看我的可能性相当渺茫。”

That little pang of guilt I feel at hearing her say that is suppressed for a moment by me swallowing a bit of my pancake. I gave down at the counter, "Yeah well... You know why that is Rei."  
听到她这么说，我心中那丝愧疚感被咽下的一口煎饼暂时压了下去。我低头看着柜台，“是啊，好吧...丽，你知道为什么的。”

"Yes. Although I must disagree with your stance, I am sure they would like to see you again."  
"是的。虽然我不同意你的立场，但我确信他们希望再次见到你。"

"No Rei... They wouldn't like to see me." I look up at her and let out a sigh, "Look, it's... it isn't that I don't believe you it's just that... I can't see them again and that's for the best. I hurt them a lot and it's just best I stay away. They... They're better off without me in their life, I'm not a good person."  
"不，丽...他们不会想见我的。" 我抬头看着她，叹了口气，"听着，不是我不相信你，只是...我不能再见到他们，这样最好。我伤害了他们很多，最好还是保持距离。他们...没有我在他们的生活中会更好，我不是个好人。"

"I do not become friends with bad people Asuka."  
"我不会和坏人交朋友的，明日香。"

I feel my cheeks glow red, "Yeah well... maybe I'm the exception to the rule."  
"我感觉脸颊发烫，红了起来，“嗯，好吧……也许我就是那个例外。””

"I do not believe so, I believe you are being too hard on yourself."  
“我不这么认为，我觉得你对自己太苛刻了。”

I shrug, "Maybe... Maybe not... I guess... they still don't know that we're friends do they?"  
“我耸耸肩，“也许吧……也许不是……我想……他们还不知道我们是朋友，对吧？””

"I have not told them anything of our friendship and I will continue to keep this a secret for as long as you desire it. As far as they are concerned you left Japan years ago and are living comfortably and off the grid."  
"我并未向他们透露我们之间的友谊，只要你希望，我会继续保守这个秘密。在他们看来，你多年前就离开了日本，过着舒适且隐居的生活。"

"T-Thank you, I'm sorry I am making you keep this a secret."  
"谢-谢谢你，很抱歉让你替我保守这个秘密。"

"I do not mind." She replies coolly, "That is what you wish and as your friend I will not betray that wish."  
"我并不介意。" 她冷静地回答，"这是你的愿望，作为你的朋友，我不会辜负这份心愿。"

"Thank you." I nervously shift from one foot to the other, "So... how are they doing?"  
"谢谢。" 我紧张地左右脚换着重心，"那么...他们现在怎么样？"

"Misato has begun work with an organization known as WILLE. I believe that she wishes to start operations in Tokyo-3 to salvage what is left of NERV."  
"美里已经开始在一个名为 WILLE 的组织工作。我相信她希望在第三新东京市启动行动，以挽救 NERV 剩余的部分。"

Another pang in my stomach at hearing the name of NERV spoken, I quickly supress it with another chocolate covered piece of pancake. I'm nearly done with this one, I should get another. Maybe not chocolate spread this time, I might try the jam, Rei seemed to enjoy that one.  
听到 NERV 这个名字，我的胃又是一阵抽痛，我迅速用另一块裹着巧克力的煎饼压下这种感觉。这块快吃完了，我应该再拿一块。也许这次不要巧克力酱了，我可能会试试果酱，丽似乎挺喜欢那个的。

"is there even anything left to recover?" I ask, "I mean... we didn't exactly leave it in a reusable state."  
"还有什么可恢复的吗？" 我问道，"我的意思是...我们并没有让它保持在一个可再利用的状态。"

Rei nods, "NERV was much bigger than any of you... even I knew. There are parts of it that will still be there and might have something of benefit to us... or something that should be destroyed. I trust that Misato will make the right decision."  
丽点头道，"NERV 比你们任何人...甚至我都知道的还要庞大。它的一些部分仍然存在，可能对我们有益...或者有些东西应该被摧毁。我相信美里会做出正确的决定。"

"Hah, making the right decision and Misato?" I start to joke but trail off, Rei seems amused but halfway through I realize the joke just isn't funny to me, "Yeah... She will. What about... well... you know who?"  
"哈哈，做出正确决定和美里？" 我开始开玩笑，但话说到一半就停住了，丽似乎觉得有趣，但我意识到这个笑话对我来说并不好笑，"是啊...她会的。那...呃...你知道是谁吗？"

She seems to take a moment to think, "He is doing well."  
她似乎花了一会儿时间思考，“他做得很好。”

She lies to me, a strange thing about Rei is that she isn't a very good liar. She always looks off in the same direction when she does so and her hand twitches on doing so. I decide to not press her on it though. I don't have any right to be too concerned about him or know more considering who I am.  
她对我撒了谎，关于丽的一个奇怪之处是，她并不擅长撒谎。每次撒谎时，她总是朝同一个方向看，而且手会不自觉地抽动。不过我决定不去追问她。考虑到我的身份，我没有权利过于关心他或了解更多。

"He has signed up to take music lessons."  
“他已经报名参加音乐课了。”

I look at her in confusion and shock, "Music lessons? What the hell would he need music lessons for? I... I heard him years ago, he was... he was very good."  
我困惑又震惊地看着她，“音乐课？他到底需要音乐课干什么？我……我多年前听过他演奏，他……他非常出色。”

It was just a shame that I had to go and ruin his night by being... me. I force the memory away as Rei replies to me, "It has been many years since he last played so he believes his skills to be somewhat rusty. He had his first lesson yesterday but I have not yet been in contact to find out how it went."  
只是可惜我不得不破坏他的夜晚，因为我就是……我。我强迫自己忘掉这段记忆，Rei 回答我，“他已经很多年没弹奏了，所以他觉得自己的技艺有些生疏。他昨天上了第一节课，但我还没联系他了解进展如何。”

"He is doing alright though?" I ask once more, in a way hoping that maybe Rei will be more truthful with me.  
“不过他应该还好吧？”我再次问道，心里暗自希望 Rei 能对我更坦诚些。

"Yes." She replies but her tone again indicating that he isn't as good as she is letting on.  
"是的。" 她回答道，但语气再次表明他并不像她表面上显得那么出色。

"I'm glad." I finally reply, "He... He deserves to be happy."  
"我很高兴。" 我终于回答，"他... 他值得幸福。"

My hand clenches into a fist as I avert my eyes from Rei. Those little daggers of guilt appear once more as I think about him, "Especially after everything that I-"  
我的手紧握成拳，目光从丽身上移开。那些小小的内疚之箭再次出现，当我想到他时，"尤其是在经历了我所做的一切之后——"

"Asuka!" Rei cuts me off sternly. I slowly look up into those piercing red eyes of hers. They're frightening and I instantly go quiet, "You should forgive yourself for all that happened. I have told you on numerous occasisions that not only you but we were all very different people back then."  
"明日香！" 绫波严厉地打断了我。我缓缓抬起头，迎上她那双锐利的红色眼眸。它们令人畏惧，我立刻安静了下来，"你应该原谅自己所发生的一切。我多次告诉过你，不仅是你，我们那时都是截然不同的人。"

"I-" I start to protest but Rei doesn't allow me in. After Third Impact Rei did find her voice and she isn't afraid of using it.  
"我——" 我正要反驳，但绫波不给我机会。在第三次冲击之后，绫波确实找到了自己的声音，并且毫不畏惧使用它。

"You are a good person Asuka and... I know that you were back then as well. You might not have always shown it but you were. If you weren't I would not have made such an effort to find you after you left Japan."  
"你是个好人，明日香……我知道你那时也是。你可能并不总是表现出来，但你是的。如果不是这样，我不会在你离开日本后如此努力地寻找你。"

"Yeah but..." "不过但是……"

"I know you see yourself solely as the Asuka who always yelled and shouted at others, who belittled other people and believed herself to be better than other people. The Asuka who would lash out frequently."  
"我知道你只看到那个总是大喊大叫、对别人冷嘲热讽、自认为高人一等的明日香。那个经常发脾气的明日香。"

I feel so much better now.  
我现在感觉好多了。

"But that is not who you are now and not all you were back then. I can look back and see the Asuka who was brave in front of monsters that threatened this world. The Asuka who tried to encourage her teammates to do better. The Asuka who risked her life to protect her friends. A frightened Asuka who wanted to reach out to others. I saw an Asuka who was unselfish, who made an effort to include someone like me when she had no reason to. That Asuka who took us to the ramen cart that night."  
但那不是现在的你，也不是过去的全部。我可以回望，看到那个在面对威胁这个世界的怪物时勇敢的明日香。那个试图鼓励队友做得更好的明日香。那个冒着生命危险保护朋友的明日香。一个想要向他人伸出援手的恐惧的明日香。我看到了一个无私的明日香，她没有理由却努力包容像我这样的人。那个带我们去拉面摊的明日香。

I'd cry on hearing her words if that wouldn't be unbelievably pathetic of me and if I hadn't already used up my weekly supply of tears after my nightmare. So instead I blink rapidly and force the stinging feeling behind my eyes to go away. She mentioned that damn ramen cart again, she has a thing for that.  
如果我不会因此显得无比可悲，如果我在噩梦后没有用尽每周的泪水配额，我会在听到她的话时哭泣。所以我快速眨眼，强迫眼中的刺痛感消失。她再次提到了那个该死的拉面摊，她对那有特别的情感。

I laugh, "Well... Misato couldn't really afford a steak dinner and... you're vegetarian so what else was I supposed to do."  
我笑了，“嗯...美里其实负担不起牛排晚餐，而且...你是素食主义者，我还能做什么呢。

"You were not supposed to do anything. It was not your responsibility, Misato should not have made the promise if she were not able to keep it. Yet you did do something and I am grateful for it."  
"你本不该做任何事的。那不是你的责任，美里如果不能遵守承诺，就不应该做出那样的承诺。但你确实做了些什么，我对此心存感激。"

"Alright!" I try to put an end to this, "You've made your point... I guess I wasn't completely awful. Maybe only 95% awful."  
"好吧！" 我试图结束这个话题，"你已经表达了你的观点...我想我并没有完全糟糕。或许只有 95%糟糕吧。"

She glares at me, "It is an improvement I suppose."  
她瞪了我一眼，"我想这算是一种进步吧。"

I watch as she leans over to grab another pancake. She seems to stop mid motion as her eyes are drawn to something on the counter. Rei does something of a double take as she looks intently at the piece of paper I had left lying there. Her mouth opens slightly as if she is shocked and I take a step forward.  
我看着她俯身去拿另一张煎饼。她的动作似乎在半空中停住了，目光被柜台上的某样东西吸引。丽盯着那张我留在那里的纸条，做了个类似双重视线的动作。她的嘴微微张开，仿佛震惊了，我向前迈了一步。

"Rei… Is everything alright? You've been looking at that piece of paper for nearly a minute now."  
“丽……一切都好吗？你已经盯着那张纸条看了一分钟了。”

She looks up at me and her expression as changed, it's hardened and for a brief moment I wonder if this is it. Is this finally the moment she is going to call me out for all the bad I've done just as I deserve. Naturally she doesn't do that, she instead picks up the piece of paper and holds it in front of me.  
她抬头看向我，表情变了，变得坚硬。有那么一瞬间，我在想这是不是就是那个时刻。她会不会终于要因为我所做的坏事而指责我，正如我所应得的那样。当然，她没有那么做，而是拿起那张纸条，举到我面前。

"This document, where did you get it?"  
"这份文件，你从哪儿弄来的？"

I look at the document she is holding and my heart starts to beat faster in my chest. It's the one that guy dropped yesterday. I can see his name written at the top followed by an address. I don't know why I picked it up, after what happened I probably should have left it there but it looked important. I was going to post it.  
我看着她手中的文件，心跳不由得加速。那是昨天那个男人掉落的，上面写着他的名字和一个地址。我不知道为什么捡了起来，经历了那些事后，我本该让它留在原地，但它看起来很重要。我原本打算寄出去的。

I lean casually on the counter trying to not show any trace of being bothered by Rei holding it up to me or by my memories of yesterday.  
我随意地靠在柜台上，试图不显露出被丽拿着文件质问或昨日记忆所困扰的痕迹。

"Oh that?" I shrug, "I... found it yesterday... some guy was coming into the café I was working in and he didn't look to see where he was going. Idiot bumped right into me and sent us both spilling to the ground. He left and dropped it."  
"哦，那个吗？" 我耸耸肩，"我……昨天发现的……有个家伙走进我打工的咖啡馆，他没看路。笨蛋直接撞上了我，结果我们俩都摔倒了。他走了，还掉了这个。"

Rei is eying me oddly, does she know what happened? Rei has a weird sense of just knowing things from time to time. She looks at the name on the form as if confirming what it says, "You... met this guy? Did anything else happen?"  
丽正用奇怪的眼神看着我，她知道发生了什么吗？丽有时候有种奇怪的直觉，能从一些事情中察觉到什么。她看着表格上的名字，仿佛在确认上面写的是什么，"你……见过这个人吗？还发生了别的事吗？"

I swallow and nod, "Well he... looked at me and he got frightened... he ran away from me. He didn't stop to pick it up he just ran. I... He knew who I was... He knew me Rei, he was frightened of me and he..."  
我咽了咽口水，点点头，"嗯，他……看了我一眼，然后就害怕了……他逃离了我。他没有停下来捡起它，只是跑了。我……他认识我……他认识我，丽，他害怕我，他……"

In a blur of motion Rei sets the form down on the table and moved into wrap me in another of her warm hugs. I don't even try to resist and I put my arms around her and rest my head on her should. I can feel myself on the verge of tears again, "He knew who I was... I've been found out Rei... I've been..."  
"在一阵模糊的动作中，丽将表格放在桌上，随即又用她温暖的拥抱将我环绕。我甚至没有试图抵抗，只是伸出双臂环抱住她，将头靠在她的肩上。我感到自己再次濒临泪水的边缘，“他知道我是谁...我被发现了，丽...我被...””

Rei shakes her head, "No... No, you haven't Asuka. You don't recognize the name on that form do you?"  
"丽摇了摇头，“不...不，你没有，明日香。你不认识表格上的那个名字，对吧？””

Still in her embrace I shake my head, "No... Why would I?"  
"在她怀中，我摇了摇头，“不...我为什么要认识？””

"Asuka that person you met… Kaworu Nagisa, he was the Fifth Child and… he was the final Angel." She informs me darkly and I feel my stomach drop, "I… I need to make a phone call."  
“明日香，你遇到的那个人……渚薰，他是第五适格者，而且……他是最后的使徒。”她阴沉地告诉我，我感到胃里一阵翻腾，“我……我需要打个电话。”

Rei breaks the hug and starts to walk towards her handbag. I reach out and grab her wrist before she can make any motion. I can't let her make a phone call just yet. I need to know more, what does she mean he was the Fifth Child? What does she mean he was the final Angel?  
绫波挣脱了拥抱，开始走向她的手提包。我伸出手抓住她的手腕，阻止她任何动作。我还不能让她打电话。我需要了解更多，她说的第五适格者是什么意思？她说的最后的使徒又是什么意思？

That person who recognized me yesterday was an Eva pilot? That person knew me because of that? I certainly didn't know him so how is that possible. I need to know more information and... I know it's selfish of me considering what she said but I can't let anyone know I'm here.  
昨天认出我的那个人是 EVA 驾驶员？那个人因为那个原因认识我？我当然不认识他，这怎么可能。我需要更多信息，而且……我知道考虑到她说的那些话，我很自私，但我不能让任何人知道我在这里。

"Wait!" I tell her, "No phonecalls, not yet."  
"等等！" 我告诉她，"现在还不能打电话。"

She looks at me, "Asuka, this is serious. He was…"  
她看着我，"明日香，这很严重。他曾是……"

I nod my head, "I know and I believe you Rei it's just… I need to know more first. What do you mean he was both the Fifth Child and the final Angel?"  
我点点头，"我知道，我相信你，丽，只是……我需要了解更多。你说他既是第五适格者又是最后的使徒是什么意思？"

I keep my hand in place and continue to look at Rei. She stares back at me before finally relaxing her pose and putting her handbag on the counter. She walks out of the kitchen into the front room where we both sit opposite one another on the seating. She sighs before looking at me, "I apologize, I… forgot that your memory of that time period is not complete."  
我保持手的位置不变，继续看着丽。她回望着我，最终放松了姿势，将手提包放在柜台上。她走出厨房，来到我们面对面坐在座位上的前厅。她叹了口气，然后看着我说：“我道歉，我……忘记了你对那段时间的记忆并不完整。”

I shake my head, "It's fine, it's not like I ever asked for those blanks to be filled in before. Not really a period of time I want to remember. Start from the beginning, who is Kaworu Nagisa?"  
我摇摇头，“没关系，我以前从未要求填补这些空白。那并不是我想回忆的时期。从头开始，碇真嗣是谁？”

Rei pauses and seems to be deep in thought for a few moments. I can imagine she is finding it tough to come up with the right words to say to me, so I decide to make it easier for her, "The Fifth Child… Shinji was the Third, Touji was the Fourth but he was injured during the activation test so the Fifth Child would have been my replacement right?"  
丽停顿了一下，似乎陷入了深深的思考。我能想象她在努力寻找合适的词句对我说，所以我决定让她更容易些，“第五个孩子……真嗣是第三个，东治是第四个，但他在启动测试中受伤了，所以第五个孩子应该是我的替代者，对吧？”

Rei nods, "Yes… He turned up around the time you…"  
丽点点头，“是的……他出现在你……”

Again I step in to make things easier, "After I ran away and tried to… kill myself?"  
我又一次介入，试图让事情变得简单些，“在我逃跑并试图……自杀之后？”

She nods again and edges closer to me holding out her hand. I place mine on top of hers and tighten around it, "It's alright Rei… I know… what I tried to do. We don't need to avoid the subject."  
她再次点头，并向我靠近，伸出她的手。我将手放在她的手上并握紧，“没事的，丽……我知道……我试图做的事。我们不需要回避这个话题。”

"You are correct, Kaworu was your replacement and arrived shortly after you were found and hospitalized. He immediately befriended Shinji. Shinji was in a very bad place at that time. He had discovered the truth of what I was and had just witnessed me die and become a different person. His friends had left Tokyo-3, you were hurt, Misato wasn't around…It was very easy for someone like Kaworu to manipulate him."  
"你说得没错，渚薰是你的替代者，在你被发现并送医后不久就来到了这里。他很快就和真嗣成为了朋友。那时的真嗣正处于非常糟糕的状态。他发现了我的真实身份，亲眼目睹了我死去并变成了另一个人。他的朋友们离开了第三新东京市，你受了伤，美里也不在身边……像渚薰这样的人很容易操纵他。"

There was genuine venom in Rei's words as she spoke of the boy. It's a little bit unnerving if I'm being honest, I've heard the girl get angry and frustrated before but never anything like this.  
丽提到那个男孩时，话语中确实带着真正的恶意。说实话，这有点让人不安，我以前听过这女孩生气和沮丧，但从未像这样。

"Manipulate him? How so?"  
"操纵他？怎么个操纵法？"

"He became friends with Shinji. He told Shinji things that he wanted to hear and Shinji fell for it and I believe for him."  
"他和真嗣成了朋友。他告诉真嗣他想听的话，真嗣信以为真，我相信他也是。"

"Fell for him?" I ask in some shock, "You mean…"  
"信以为真？" 我有些震惊地问，"你是说…"

I trail off unsure of how to phrase my question. I would not be entirely surprised if he was not in fact heterosexual but the truth was in the time I knew him I never known him to show a romantic interest in anyone, except of course… for those brief fleeting moments when we kissed and when we encountered each other in Third Impact.  
我话没说完，不确定如何表达我的疑问。如果他实际上不是异性恋，我也不会完全惊讶，但说实话，在我认识他的这段时间里，我从没见过他对任何人表现出浪漫的兴趣，当然，除了…那些短暂而转瞬即逝的时刻，我们接吻的时候，以及在第三次冲击中相遇的时候。

Rei nods again, "I do not doubt that there was some romantic attachment on the part of Shinji. Whether it is because of Kaworu appearing at the right time or not I do not know. My brother has never shown any romantic or sexual interest in anyone. I wanted to say or do something at the time but things were very muddle for me in my third body… Also given what Shinji has just discovered about me I did not feel he would trust me."  
丽再次点头，“我不怀疑真嗣对渚薰有某种浪漫情感。至于这是否因为渚薰恰逢其时出现，我不得而知。我弟弟从未对任何人表现出浪漫或性方面的兴趣。当时我想说些什么或做些什么，但我的第三使徒形态让我感到非常混乱……而且，鉴于真嗣刚刚发现我的秘密，我觉得他不会信任我。”

"So what happened?" “那后来发生了什么？”

"Barely a couple of days after he arrived Kaworu snuck into NERV and hijacked Unit 02. His Angel form allowed him to manipulate the Eva and he used it to descend towards Central Dogma."  
“他到达后不过几天，渚薰就潜入了 NERV 并劫持了二号机。他的使徒形态使他能够操控 EVA，并利用它向中央教条区降落。”

Anger flares up inside of me at hearing Rei say this, not so much at the betrayal but at the fact that he used my Unit 02 to do it. How dare he do such a thing, how dare he takes what was mine!  
听到丽这么说，我心中怒火中烧，倒不是因为背叛，而是他用我的零二号机做了这件事。他怎么敢这样做，怎么敢夺走属于我的东西！

"On reaching Central Dogma he found out that he was standing in front of Lilith and now Adam like he thought. He realized that much like he had used Shinji, SEELE had used him and meant for him to fulfil his role in their plan and die. It was Shinji who dealt the final blow. It… broke Shinji. Kaworu wasn't human but he looked, sounded and smelled human. He was much more human than I was, Shinji not only had to deal with the loss and betrayal of a friend but with killing what was a living person."  
到达中央教条区后，他发现自己正站在莉莉丝和亚当面前，正如他所料。他意识到，就像他利用了真嗣一样，SEELE 也利用了他，意图让他完成他们在计划中的角色并死去。是真嗣给予了最后一击。那……击垮了真嗣。渚薰虽非人类，但他看起来、听起来、闻起来都像人类。他比我更像人类，真嗣不仅要面对朋友的失去和背叛，还要面对杀死一个活生生的人的事实。

I lower my eyes, I know what happened after this. I know the events afterwards, "I see, no wonder he…"  
我垂下眼帘，我知道这之后发生了什么。我知道后续的事件，“我明白了，难怪他会……”

I can remember those moments before Third Impact quite clearly. Being in my Eva and fighting, waiting, hoping that he would show up to save the day. I had never wanted it to happen so badly but it wasn't to be. I died on that day except… I didn't really die. Instead I was pulled into Instrumentality and forced to relive moments and try to untangle the mess of my fucked up life.  
我清晰地记得第三次冲击前的那些时刻。身处我的 Eva 中战斗、等待，期盼着他能出现拯救一切。我从未如此渴望它发生，但终究未能如愿。那天我死了，然而……我并没有真正死去。相反，我被卷入了人类补完计划，被迫重温那些瞬间，试图解开我那混乱不堪的生活。

I feel Rei's warm hand tighten around mine, "I apologize for making you relive your memories of those moments. I know they are painful, they are for me too. If you wish I will go."  
我感到丽温暖的手紧紧握住我的，“我为让你重温那些记忆而道歉。我知道它们很痛苦，对我来说也是如此。如果你愿意，我会离开。”

I look up at her and shake my head, "No please… stay. I'm glad you're here it's just… a lot to take in. I just… I didn't know about any of this. No one told me and I never bothered to ask. It just… puts a lot of things in perspective now."  
我抬头看着她，摇了摇头，“不，请……留下来。我很高兴你在这里，只是……这一切难以消化。我只是……我对此一无所知。没人告诉我，我也从未问过。现在……这让我对很多事情有了新的认识。”

As I speak I hear my voice start to tremble slightly. I blink away the tears again, in some way my heart feels somewhat lighter at hearing the strange tale of Kaworu Nagisa. He did recognize me and he must have been frightened of me but not for the reasons I thought, it was because he must have thought I knew what he did and I'd hurt him.  
当我说话时，我听到自己的声音开始微微颤抖。我再次眨去泪水，不知为何，听到渚薰那奇异的故事，我的心感到一丝轻松。他确实认出了我，他一定被我吓到了，但不是我以为的原因，而是因为他一定以为我知道他所做的事，我会伤害他。

I look up at Rei's frowning face and feel that if I were to hurt Kaworu I'd have to get into a queue behind Rei. The only thing is I have no wish to hurt him, I don't want to be that angry person, I don't want to hurt people anymore even if they do deserve it in some way.  
我抬头看着绫波皱眉的脸，感觉如果要伤害渚薰，我得排在绫波后面。唯一的问题是，我并不想伤害他，我不想成为那个愤怒的人，我不想再伤害任何人，即使他们某种程度上应受惩罚。

I don't really understand why Kaworu would have ran from me though. If he is an Angel then why would he be afraid fo a human like me.  
我不太明白为什么渚薰会从我身边逃开。如果他是使徒，那他为什么会害怕像我这样的人类。

"He must have… known who I was yesterday then. That's why he ran like that but… if why would he run?" I ask Rei to see if maybe she knows.  
"他昨天肯定……知道我是谁了。所以他才那样跑掉，但是……如果他为什么要跑呢？" 我问丽，看她是否可能知道。

"I do not know." Rei replies to me, "I do not know why he is alive right now but I wish to find out. I also want to make sure no harm comes to you or anyone. He will not hurt one of my friends again."  
"我不知道。" 丽回答我，"我不知道他为什么现在还活着，但我希望能弄清楚。我也想确保你或任何人不受伤害。他不会再伤害我的朋友了。"

I muster up a grin, "I can take care of myself Rei. I'll… let you make your phone call, just… don't… mention… if you can."  
我勉强挤出一个笑容，"我能照顾好自己，丽。我会……让你打你的电话，只是……别……提到……如果可以的话。"

"Do not worry, I will be sure to not mention your involvement in this."  
"别担心，我保证不会提及你在这件事中的参与。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

**Tokyo-2 – Early Evening  东京-2 —— 傍晚时分**

I leave the small meeting room and head straight down the corridor towards my temporary office. The meeting was admittedly not quite as productive as I'd have hoped. A lot of the focus was on them questioning me and my actions during the war against the Angels.  
我离开那间小会议室，径直沿着走廊走向我的临时办公室。坦白说，这次会议并没有我期望的那么有成效。大部分时间他们都围绕着我在对抗使徒战争中的行为对我进行质询。

I know why they did it, they want to find out who I am, who I was and whether I'm worthy enough to accomplish what I need to do. They want to see if I'm capable and strong enough and want to see if my personal feelings aren't getting in the way. They want to make me look stupid so they can all get their people in there and freeze us out.  
我明白他们的意图，他们想弄清楚我是谁，我过去是谁，以及我是否有能力完成我需要做的事情。他们想确认我是否足够能干和坚强，同时也要看看我的个人情感是否会成为障碍。他们试图让我显得愚蠢，以便他们能安插自己的人进来，把我们排挤出去。

I can't say I didn't expect any of it though, it was something that I discussed in length with Maya and the others before we decided to go into this. So, I did my best to remain calm and focused. I answered any and all questions as professionally as I could. I deflected when I was able to and tried to keep everything on track to what to do with Tokyo-3.  
虽然我不能说我完全没有预料到这些，但在我们决定进入这个领域之前，我已经和真希波和其他人详细讨论过了。因此，我尽力保持冷静和专注。我尽可能专业地回答了所有问题。当我能够时，我会巧妙地转移话题，并试图将一切保持在处理第三新东京市的轨道上。

In a way I am still questioning why I'm doing this. Maybe my personal feelings are getting in the way somehow but Fuyutsuki persuaded me I was the best person for it and I'd make the right decisions. He wants me to do this and I believed him.  
在某种程度上，我仍然在质疑自己为什么要这样做。也许我的个人情感在某种程度上影响了判断，但冬月说服了我，我是最适合做这件事的人，我会做出正确的决定。他希望我这样做，我相信他。

It isn't as if no progress was made during the meeting though. We now have a date for the next meeting and we know that each interested party will be presenting their team to do an exploratory sweep of the abandoned zone. I've already selected Maya and Makoto as my team. If there are any people best suited for it it'd be those two. Ritsuko would have course been an ideal candidate too but nothing will persuade her to join us. She seems happy teaching at a local school now and I can't blame her.  
尽管如此，会议并非毫无进展。我们现在有了下一次会议的日期，并且知道每个感兴趣的团体都将派出他们的团队对废弃区域进行勘察。我已经选定了真希波和真琴作为我的团队。如果有最适合的人选，那一定是他们两个。律子当然也是一个理想的人选，但没有什么能说服她加入我们。她现在似乎很高兴在当地学校教书，我不能责怪她。

As I enter the office I feel my phone vibrating in my bad. I quickly pull it out and glance at the caller ID. It's Rei, that's unusual, I thought that she was enjoying herself in America at this moment. Why would she be calling me now?  
当我走进办公室时，感觉到手机在包里震动。我迅速掏出手机，瞥了一眼来电显示。是丽，这很奇怪，我以为她现在正在美国享受呢。她为什么现在给我打电话？

Hoping everything is alright I answer, "Hello, Rei? Is everything alright?"  
希望一切都好，我接起电话，“喂，丽？一切都好吗？”

There is a small pause and I hear the sound of a door closing, "Hello Misato, everything is fine."  
电话那头稍稍停顿了一下，我听到了关门的声音，“你好，美里，一切都好。”

I relax my shoulders and breathe out a sigh of relief, "Oh good! How is America?"  
我放松了肩膀，松了一口气，“哦，太好了！美国那边怎么样？”

There is another brief pause, "I am not currently in America. I am actually in Germany right now, Berlin to be precise."  
又是一阵短暂的停顿，“我现在不在美国。实际上，我现在在德国，准确地说是在柏林。”

"Berlin?" I exclaim, what the hell is Rei doing in Berlin?  
“柏林？”我惊呼道，Rei 到底在柏林干什么？

"What are you doing in Berlin?" I ask her, I already have a suspicion, one I've had for quite some time but I've never spoken or asked about it. It's a bit of an unwritten rule in our home that we don't speak of certain things. I wonder if... Well I doubt Rei will say one way or the other.  
"你在柏林做什么？" 我问她，我心里已经有了一个猜测，这个猜测我已经揣摩了很久，但从未提起或询问过。在我们家里，有些事情是不成文的规定，我们不谈论。我在想，如果……嗯，我怀疑丽不会明确表态。

"America bored me." She replied, "So I decided to come to Europe instead. It was something of an impulsive decision I made yesterday."  
"美国让我感到无聊。" 她回答道，"所以我决定来欧洲。这是昨天我一时冲动做出的决定。"

"Oh." I shrug casually, "As long as you're alright."  
"哦。" 我随意地耸了耸肩，"只要你没事就好。"

"I am doing fine but... there is a reason I am calling you. Since arriving I have... seen something..."  
"我一切都好，但是...我打电话给你是有原因的。自从到达这里，我...看到了一些东西..."

I feel a little pang of nervousness in my stomach as she says that. My mind immediately begins to wander to dark places, I can't help it. I worry about her, I know she is sensible, probably the most sensible out of all of us and she is incredibly mature too considering she has only really started to explore her own humanity over the last few years but she is not invincible.  
听到她这么说，我感到一丝紧张在胃里翻腾。我的思绪立刻飘向了阴暗的角落，我无法控制。我担心她，我知道她很理智，可能是我们中最理智的一个，而且考虑到她只是在过去几年才开始真正探索自己的人性，她的成熟程度也令人难以置信，但她并非无懈可击。

Added with the fact that she is currently in Germany I begin to run over other worst-case scenarios. That thing which we don't speak of, is it something to do with that? Has Rei seen her? Is...  
再加上她现在在德国，我开始设想其他最坏的情况。那个我们不提的东西，是和它有关吗？丽是否看到了她？还是...

My own thoughts are cut off by Rei speaking, "Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
我的思绪被丽的话语打断，“渚薰还活着。”

My jaw drops, that was certainly not what I was expecting to hear. In a million years I would not have ran that scenario through my head. I find myself unable to say anything in response to her. In a way I'm relieved that it was not one of the things I had thought of, in another I'm terrified knowing what this could represent.  
我惊得下巴都掉了，这绝对不是我预料中的答案。就算给我一百万年，我也想不到会是这种情况。我发现自己无法回应她。一方面，我松了口气，因为这不是我之前想到的任何一种可能；另一方面，我感到恐惧，因为这可能意味着什么。

"Misato are you there?" “美里，你在吗？”

Rei's voice brings me back down to Earth, I have to make sure she did in fact say what I thought she did.  
丽的声音将我拉回现实，我必须确认她确实说了我以为她说的那句话。

"Rei... Can you repeat that please?"  
“丽……你能再说一遍吗？”

"Yes. Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
“是的。渚薰还活着。”

Kaworu Nagisa... A name I haven't heard of in a long time. If that other subject is not spoken about in our home then the subject of Kaworu is even more complicated. My mind immediately wanders to Shinji and how he would react to this news. I know exactly how Shinji feels about Kaworu. I know Shinji still harbours feelings of guilt towards what he did, towards what he had to do. I can understand it though, killing someone is not a pleasant thing... even if they are your enemy.  
渚薰...一个我许久未曾听闻的名字。如果家里不提及另一个话题，那么关于渚薰的话题则更为复杂。我的思绪立刻飘向了真嗣，想象他会如何回应这个消息。我清楚真嗣对渚薰的感情。我知道真嗣仍对所做之事心怀愧疚，对不得不做的事感到内疚。我能理解，毕竟，杀人绝非愉快之事...即便对方是敌人。

"Okay Rei..." I try to focus myself and make an attempt to switch to Major Katsuragi mode, "Tell me more, when did you see him? How did you see him? Are you certain it was him?"  
“好的，绫波...”我努力集中精神，试图切换到葛城美里少校模式，“告诉我更多，你何时见到他的？如何见到的？你确定是他吗？”

So Rei tells me, keeping her words short and to the point, "I saw him yesterday, he was entering a small café in the city but I do not recall the name. I am certain it was him, there is no mistaking that."  
绫波简洁明了地告诉我：“我昨天见到他，他正进入城里的一家小咖啡馆，但我不记得名字了。我确信是他，绝不会认错。”

"Right." I nod my head, "And did he see you at all?"  
"好的。" 我点点头，"那他有没有看到你？"

"No."

"Good." I nod again, "Look Rei, I know you're on holiday but I'm going to ask you to cut it short. I want you to come back to Japan as soon as you can, I'm going to find out more about this."  
"很好。" 我又点了点头，"听着，丽，我知道你在度假，但我希望你能提前结束。我想让你尽快回日本，我要查清楚这件事。"

"Understood." "明白了。"

"Goodbye Rei, see you soon."  
"再见，丽，很快见。"

"See you soon Misato." "很快见，美里。"

Rei hangs up the phone and I stand there in disbelief for at least a minute. Kaworu Nagisa is back on this Earth and has somehow found himself in Berlin. That one thing I have been afraid of for so long has happened. If Nagisa is back then what else does that mean? Does it mean more Angels can return? Does it mean SEELE are back?  
丽挂断电话，我站在那里难以置信至少一分钟。渚薰回到了地球，不知怎么地出现在柏林。那个我长久以来一直害怕的事情发生了。如果薰回来了，那还意味着什么？是否意味着更多使徒能够回归？是否意味着 Seele 也回来了？

I try to focus my thoughts, there is no point jumping to conclusions just yet. What I need to do is gather information first if I rush into doing something then people are going to get hurt, most of all that kid who is sitting back in my apartment right now. I need to protect him most of all.  
我试图集中思绪，现在就急于下结论毫无意义。我需要先收集信息，如果贸然行动，人们会受到伤害，尤其是现在正坐在我公寓里的那个孩子。我最需要保护的就是他。

So, what do I do now? There are a few people I can contact but I suppose my first port of call will be the person I always turn to for advice. I'll start with her, she might know something before I go further down the rabbit hole.  
那么，我现在该怎么办？有几个我可以联系的人，但我想我的首选应该是我总是寻求建议的那个人。我会先找她，也许在我进一步深入之前，她已经知道些什么了。

It doesn't take long before answers the phone. She sounds happy and I immediately feel bad for what I'm about to say, "Hello MIsato, just finished your meeting I'm guessing."  
电话很快就被接通了。她的声音听起来很高兴，我立刻为自己即将说的话感到内疚，“你好，美里，我猜你的会议刚结束吧。”

I don't greet her, "Ritsuko, Kaworu Nagisa is back."  
我没有向她打招呼，“律子，渚薰回来了。”

There is silence and I imagine her in very much a similar state to what I was when Rei told me. Her voice comes back moments later, "Can you repeat that?"  
一片寂静，我想象着她的状态与我听到绫波告诉我时相似。片刻后，她的声音传来，“你能再说一遍吗？”

"Kaworu Nagisa is back." “渚薰回来了。”

She isn't silent this time, "Are you sure? How do you know?"  
这次她没有沉默，“你确定吗？你怎么知道的？”

"Rei just phoned to tell me, she is currently in Berlin and she saw him."  
“丽刚刚打电话告诉我，她目前在柏林，并且看到了他。”

"When?" “什么时候？”

"Some point yesterday, he was entering a café there. He didn't see her though fortunately."  
"昨天某个时刻，他正走进那里的咖啡馆。不过幸运的是，他没看到她。"

"You're sure she didn't just make a mistake."  
"你确定她不是搞错了。"

"Ritsuko, this is Rei we're talking about here, if she says she saw him then we can be sure of it. Besides... how many people do you think there are who look like Kaworu Nagisa?"  
"律子，我们说的是绫波，如果她说她看到了他，那我们就可以确信。再说...你觉得有多少人长得像渚薰？"

"True..." Ritsuko pauses for a moment, "I don't understand though, how can he be back? He was..."  
"真的..." 赤木律子顿了一下，"不过我不明白，他怎么可能回来了？他曾经..."

"An Angel?" I finish Ritsuko's sentence for her, "I don't know Rits, I was hoping you might know something."  
"成了天使？" 我替赤木律子说完这句话，"我不知道，律子，我本以为你可能知道些什么。"

"I'm afraid I can't really help you, I know nothing about him either. His name came up on reports back then but that was literally just it, a name and a date of birth. I didn't have access to any further information on him, you know how NERV was and by the time he arrived I wasn't exactly in good standing with others..."  
"恐怕我也帮不上忙，关于他我也一无所知。他的名字和出生日期当时出现在报告上，但也就仅此而已。我没有权限获取更多关于他的信息，你知道 NERV 那时的状况，而且他出现时，我与其他人的关系并不融洽..."

I bow my head at hearing her say that, in my panic to try to learn more I had forgotten just what had happened to Ritsuko at that point in time. With the way she carries herself now it's easy to forget that she was deep into her own personal hell back then too."  
听到她这么说，我低下头，在急于了解更多情况时，我忘记了那时丽津子经历了什么。现在她这样从容不迫，很容易让人忘记她当时也深陷个人地狱。

"I know... Sorry." “我知道……对不起。”

"It's fine, out of all the people back then I am the one most likely to know something. The best I can offer is that Kaworu seemed to be similar to Rei, a hybrid of Angel and human, he was also a part of SEELE's dummy plug system."  
“没关系，在那时的人中，我最有可能知道一些事情。我能提供的最好信息是，渚薰似乎和绫波零类似，是天使与人类的混血，他也是 SEELE 的傀儡系统的一部分。”

"So like Rei... he would have had spares..."  
"就像丽...他应该有备用品..."

"Exactly. Although anything like that would have been kept in SEELEs main strongholds which were raided years ago. I don't remember them finding anything like that."  
"没错。尽管这类东西应该都存放在 SEELE 的主要据点，而这些据点多年前就被突袭了。我不记得他们找到过类似的东西。"

"Well if they did they could have kept it secret, Rei and Kaworu... were miracles of science really. I imagine a lot of people would want to keep hold of that sort of thing." My mind then leaps immediately to the worst case, "You don't think that... SEELE might still be..."  
"如果他们真的找到了，可能会保密。丽和薰...确实是科学的奇迹。我想很多人都会想保留这种东西。"" 我的思绪立刻跳到了最坏的情况，""你不会认为...SEELE 可能还在..."

"We shouldn't jump to conclusions yet." Ritsuko says to me, "I'm just offering one possibility, there are others. He could have... returned just like Rei did."  
"我们还不应该急于下结论。" 律子对我说，"我只是提出一种可能性，还有其他的。他可能...就像丽一样回来了。"

I know she is right, I shouldn't leap to the worst-case scenario but I want to prepare myself just in case. There is a brief pause before she speaks again, "Are you going to tell Shinji?"  
我知道她是对的，我不应该直接想到最坏的情况，但我想要做好准备以防万一。短暂的停顿后，她再次开口，"你要告诉真嗣吗？"

"No... Not yet, he's... having a tough time at the moment with the music lessons thing and I don't want to add to that. Until I learn more I think I'll keep this quiet."  
"不...暂时不告诉他，他...现在因为音乐课的事情已经很艰难了，我不想再给他增加负担。在我了解更多之前，我想我会保持沉默。"

"A wise decision." She pauses again, "Speak to Fuyutsuki, I know you don't like dealing with him and... well I'm not a fan either but he does seem to be genuinely trying to help. If anyone is likely to know something it'll be him."  
"明智的决定。" 她再次停顿，"去找冬月谈谈，我知道你不喜欢和他打交道，而且……好吧，我也不太喜欢他，但他似乎确实在努力帮忙。如果有人可能知道些什么，那一定是他。"

I sigh, "I know... Fuyutsuki it is then. Bye Rits."  
我叹了口气，"我知道了……那就找冬月吧。再见，律子。"

"Goodbye Misato and... good luck."  
"再见，美里，还有……祝你好运。"

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin – Mid Afternoon 柏林 – 午后时分**

I shift myself around on my seat trying to get comfortable and reach across the desk for my cup of coffee. My fingertips grace the top of the plastic cup and I gently grip and lift it. I raise it slightly from the desk when a sudden knock at the door causes me to jump in fright. I let out a noise and drop the cup, it falls to the desk, some of the contents spilling onto my hand and the rest down the desk onto the floor below.  
我挪动着身体，试图在座位上找到一个舒适的姿势，然后伸手去拿桌上的咖啡杯。我的指尖轻触到塑料杯的顶部，轻轻握住并将其提起。当我正要将杯子从桌上稍稍举起时，突然的敲门声让我吓了一跳。我发出一声惊呼，杯子从手中滑落，掉在桌上，一些咖啡溅到了我的手上，剩下的则顺着桌子流到了地板上。

I look up and see Fuyutsuki enter the office, he looks around briefly taking in the sight of the mess I've made and then the sight of me clutching my hand in pain, "Nagisa! Are you alright?"  
我抬头看见冬月走进办公室，他环顾四周，目光扫过我制造的混乱，然后看到我痛苦地紧握着手，“渚！你还好吗？”

I nod my head angrily, annoyed at myself for letting this happen and ending with me looking like an idiot in front of Fuyutsuki. Ever since last night I've been a bag of nerves. I barely got any sleep last night and I've been unable to focus on anything so far today. I keep on shaking and every noise is getting to me. Coming into work was a struggle, I keep on expecting to see her wherever I go, I keep on expecting to see the others and expecting them to give me what I deserve.  
我愤怒地点头，对自己让这种情况发生并在冬月面前显得像个傻瓜感到恼火。自从昨晚以来，我一直紧张不安。昨晚我几乎没怎么睡，今天一整天都无法集中注意力。我一直在发抖，每一个噪音都让我心烦意乱。来上班是一场挣扎，我走到哪里都期待看到她，我走到哪里都期待看到其他人，期待他们给我应得的。

Fuyutsuki takes a look at my hand and shakes his head, "Wait here I'll go and get you a cloth. I don't think you've burnt anything."  
冬月看了看我的手，摇了摇头，“在这儿等着，我去给你拿块布。我觉得你没有烫伤什么。”

I nod again as Fuyutsuki leaves the office and slips into the kitchen down the corridor. In the meantime I sit myself down on my seat and let out a sigh as I watch the spilled coffee drip off of the desk onto the floor. I suppose I should think myself lucky that it didn't hit anything on my desk.  
我再次点头，看着冬月离开办公室，悄悄走进走廊尽头的厨房。与此同时，我坐回自己的座位，叹了口气，看着洒出的咖啡从桌面上滴落到地板上。我想我应该庆幸它没有溅到桌上的任何东西。

As I sit and wait for Fuyutsuki to return my mind once again replays the scene from yesterday. My unfortunate encounter with the former Second Child, Asuka Langley Soryu. I find myself asking a number of questions about it, what was she doing here? Is anyone else here with her? Did she even recognize me?  
当我坐着等待冬月回来时，昨天的那一幕再次在我脑海中重演。我与前二号适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷不幸的相遇。我不禁对这次遭遇提出了一系列问题，她在这里做什么？还有其他人跟她在一起吗？她是否认出了我？

I try to think about what I know about her. I know she is originally from Germany but from what I understood she had made Japan her home as a pilot. I only had access to minimal files on her but my understanding was that her family situation was complicated and she had expressed a desire to her guardian to remain in Japan.  
我试图回忆我对她的了解。我知道她原本来自德国，但据我所知，作为驾驶员，她已将日本视为自己的家。我只能接触到她有限的档案，但我的理解是，她的家庭状况复杂，她曾向她的监护人表达过希望留在日本的愿望。

I lean back and wonder about my other questions. She seemed to be alone at the time but that doesn't mean anything. She could have been meeting someone in the café or going to meet someone after being in there. As for whether or not she recognized me, she was incapacitated when I went into NERV but I'm sure in all the years that have passed for her someone would have told her about me.  
我向后靠去，思索着其他问题。她当时似乎是一个人，但这并不意味着什么。她可能在咖啡馆里与人会面，或者在那儿之后要去见某人。至于她是否认出了我，我进入 NERV 时她已经无法行动，但我确信，这些年过去了，总会有人告诉她关于我的事。

She didn't seem to recognize me but in the confusion of it all I don't think she had the chance to properly take a look. Still I know myself I'm not exactly normal looking so there is a chance she'll have recognized me.  
她似乎没有认出我，但在那一片混乱中，我想她没有机会仔细看清楚。尽管如此，我了解自己，我看起来并不普通，所以她有可能认出了我。

Fuyutsuki finally reenters the room with a cloth and a handful of paper towels. I take them from him and start to clean up the mess I've made. As I do so I can feel his eyes on me and I wonder if he is angry at me for what happened. I look up and see the same sympathetic eyes I've seen from him since I first met him.  
冬月终于带着一块布和一把纸巾回到了房间。我从他手中接过，开始清理我造成的混乱。在清理的过程中，我能感觉到他的目光在我身上，我不知道他是否因为发生的事情而对我生气。我抬头看去，看到的依旧是自初次见面以来他那充满同情的眼神。

"Nagisa, Is everything okay with you today? You have seemed somewhat distracted all day and it is most unlike you, did something happen at the interview yesterday?"  
渚，你今天一切都好吗？你一整天都显得有些心不在焉，这可不像你啊，昨天面试是不是发生了什么事？

I avert my gaze from him and I actually consider lying to him and telling him I'm fine. It seems embarrassing to admit the truth but I know that if I don't things might get worse. So I swallow what little I have of my pride and shake my head, "I… The interview went fine yesterday, they are eager for me to start."  
我避开他的目光，甚至考虑对他撒谎说自己没事。承认真相似乎很尴尬，但我知道如果我不说，情况可能会变得更糟。于是我咽下仅存的一点自尊，摇了摇头，“我……昨天的面试挺顺利的，他们急着让我开始工作。”

"I see, so what is the issue?"  
“这样啊，那问题出在哪里呢？”

"On the way back from the interview I was going to go into a small café to relax and… there was an incident. I… encountered someone…"  
"从面试回来的路上，我本打算进一家小咖啡馆放松一下，然后……发生了一件事。我……遇到了某个人……"

His expression turns from sympathetic to deathly serious and he steps forward, "Was this someone you know?"  
他的表情从同情转为极其严肃，他向前一步，"你认识这个人吗？"

"Yes… Well no… sort of…" I fumble my words, "I don't know them exactly but I know of them and I fear that I am known to then. I saw… the Second Child… I saw Asuka Langley Soryu."  
"是的……呃，不……算是吧……" 我结结巴巴地说，"我不确切认识他们，但我听说过他们，而且我担心他们也知道我。我看到了……第二适格者……我看到了惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

"Ah!" Fuyutsuki takes a step back from me and shakes his head, "I see… I was afraid that something like this might happen eventually."  
"啊！" 冬月从我身边退后一步，摇了摇头，"我明白了……我担心这种事情最终会发生。"

"Y-You were afraid of something like this happening?" I ask him and find it hard to hide my surprise, I don't know if I should be angry or not at hearing this, "Did you know Asuka was here in Berlin?"  
"你担心会发生这种事？" 我问他，难以掩饰自己的惊讶，不知道听到这个消息是否该生气，"你知道明日香在柏林吗？"

"He gives a small nod and goes to sit down at his desk, "I am afraid I did know but I did not anticipate any issues. Belin is a vast city and the odds of you two meeting were slim."  
"他微微点头，走到桌前坐下，"我确实知道，但没想到会有什么问题。柏林是个大城市，你们俩相遇的几率很小。"

I finish cleaning my desk and the area around it and deposit the kitchen towel into the small bin before sitting back down at my desk. My hand is still stinging from where the coffee hit it and I try to process what Fuyutsuki has told me.  
我清理完桌面及周围区域，将厨房毛巾丢进小垃圾桶，然后重新坐回桌前。我的手仍因咖啡溅到而刺痛，我试图消化冬月告诉我的事情。

"I must apologize to you Nagisa, perhaps I should have told you before that there was a risk of you encountering her but from what is known of her we didn't think it'd be a factor. Can I ask… did anything happen when you saw her?"  
“我必须向你道歉，渚，也许我早该告诉你有可能会遇到她，但根据已知信息，我们没想到这会成为问题。我能问一下……你见到她时发生了什么吗？”

"No…" I say to him, "I accidentally bumped into her when she was coming out of the café, she yelled at me and I tried to help her up to her feet. When I realized who she was I… I turned and ran away. I don't think she recognized me."  
“没有……”我对他说，“我在她从咖啡馆出来时无意中撞到了她，她对我大喊大叫，我试图扶她起来。当我意识到她是谁时，我……转身跑开了。我想她没有认出我。”

"Perhaps she didn't… A lot of time has passed and I don't think Asuka has ever been properly informed of that period of time. Asuka…" Fuyutsuki bows his head, "Asuka decided shortly after Third Impact to return to Germany and cut off all contact with her former friends and colleagues. We do of course monitor her for her own safety but she wishes nothing to do with us."  
“或许她并不知情……时间已经过去很久，我不认为明日香曾被妥善告知那段时期的情况。明日香……” 冬月低头说道，“在第三次冲击后不久，明日香决定返回德国，并切断了与所有旧友和同事的联系。我们当然出于她的安全考虑对她进行监控，但她希望与我们毫无瓜葛。”

Fuyutsuki stops there and I wonder if there is anything more to the story than he is telling me. I wonder why Asuka chose to leave Japan behind and why she decided to cut off contact from others. I know little else about her, my focus when I went to Tokyo-3 was on Shinji as he was the only other active pilot. I decide now is not the best time to inquire about such things.  
冬月说到这里便停下了，我不禁猜测他是否还有更多未透露的故事。我想知道明日香为何选择离开日本，又为何决定与他人断绝联系。我对她的了解甚少，我在东京-3 时主要关注的是真嗣，因为他是唯一活跃的驾驶员。我决定现在不是询问这些事情的最佳时机。

Fuyutsuki addresses me again, "Again I apologize that I did not tell you that there was a risk of this. If you wish you can take the rest of the day off and we can look into rehoming you elsewhere to prevent such things."  
冬月再次向我致意，“再次为我没有告知你这种风险而道歉。如果你愿意，可以休息一天，我们可以考虑为你重新安排住处，以避免此类事情发生。”

I shake my head, "N-No… I would… This place is my home now and I am grateful to be here and to be able to work here. I want to continue living here. I have very little here but what I do have I like and I don't want to lose it, I would rather stay."  
我摇摇头，“不……我不会……这里现在是我的家，我很感激能在这里，能在这里工作。我想继续住在这里。我拥有的东西不多，但我喜欢我所拥有的，我不想失去它们，我宁愿留下来。”

"Very well." He replies, "If you have any issues please let me know. I don't want to see you hurt."  
“很好。”他回答，“如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。我不想看到你受伤。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early evening 柏林 —— 傍晚时分**

Why am I doing this? It's a question that I've been asking myself constantly since I left my apartment just under thirty minutes ago. I round a street corner and pull the envelope out of my pocket and pop the small form out. I glance at the address and compare it with the apartment block I'm now stood in front of. This is definitely the right place.  
我为何要这么做？自从大约三十分钟前离开公寓，这个问题就一直萦绕在我心头。我转过一个街角，从口袋里掏出信封，取出里面的小纸条。瞥了一眼地址，与眼前这栋公寓楼对比确认。这里无疑就是目的地。

My hand hovers over the buzzer and I once again ask myself just why I'm doing this. I don't have any answer except that I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Kaworu Nagisa fled from me yesterday, I'm curious as to who he is and how he came back, I'm curious as to why he is in Berlin right now. I continue to stand in front of the buzzer as a certain saying about cats and curiosity runs through my head.  
我的手悬停在门铃上方，再次自问究竟为何要这么做。除了好奇，我找不到其他答案。我好奇为什么渚薰昨天从我身边逃离，好奇他是谁、又是如何回来的，好奇他此刻为何会在柏林。我站在门铃前，脑海中不禁浮现出那句关于猫和好奇心的俗语。

I dread to think what Rei would think or say if she knew I was doing this. My finger finally presses the buzzer and I wait, there is no sound from the device and I press it again. There is still no sound and I look down at the door and see the lock is broken. I shake my head and gently push the door open and step inside the lobby.  
我不敢想象丽如果知道我在做这件事会怎么想或说什么。我的手指终于按下了门铃，我等待着，设备没有发出任何声音，我又按了一次。仍然没有声音，我低头看向门，发现锁是坏的。我摇了摇头，轻轻推开门，走进了大堂。

It would have been so easy for me to just post this to him but for some reason I was compelled to deliver it to him myself. After a bit of walking I finally reach his door, it's an unassuming brown wooden door just like the many others in the hallway. I knock twice and wait, listening out for sounds of movement. I take one cautious step back from the door and prepare for the worst.  
我本可以很容易地直接寄给他，但不知为何，我被驱使着亲自送给他。走了一段路后，我终于到了他的门前，这是一扇不起眼的棕色木门，就像走廊上的许多其他门一样。我敲了两下，等待着，留意着是否有动静的声音。我小心翼翼地后退一步，准备应对最坏的情况。

Yesterday is replaying in my head, how I collided with him and we were both sent spilling to the ground. How he got up and ran from me and how I lost a night's sleep because of it. I think about all those things Rei told me about him in her attempt to fill in some of the blanks. This guy was the last Angel, strange I didn't think they could take human form.  
昨天的一幕在我脑海中重现，我如何与他相撞，我们俩都摔倒在地。他如何起身逃离我，以及我因此失眠了一整夜。我想起了丽试图填补空白时告诉我的关于他的那些事。这家伙是最后一个天使，奇怪的是，我没想到他们能以人类形态出现。

I wonder if I should be scared of him, judging by his reaction yesterday probably not but then what should I feel about him? Should I be angry at him? For doing what he did to… for what he did to a certain other person? For nearly destroying this world. In that way he is no different from me but at least I suppose I was at least honest about what a horrible person I was.  
我不知是否该怕他，从他昨天的反应来看或许不必，但那我又该对他有何感受？我该对他生气吗？因为他对……对某个人所做的事？因为他差点毁了这个世界。在这点上，他和我没什么不同，但至少我想我对自己是个多么糟糕的人还算坦诚。

After a time, I hear the sounds of a lock opening and the door opens slowly to reveal Kaworu Nagisa to me. I'm only able to catch a glimpse of him, it looks like he is still in his work clothes, he's wearing a pair of smart grey trousers, a plain white shirt and orange tie. That is all I'm able to see of him before he locks eyes with me, he jumps backwards and immediately tries to slam the door in my face.  
过了一会儿，我听到开锁的声音，门缓缓打开，露出的是渚薰。我只来得及瞥他一眼，看起来他还在工作状态，穿着一条灰色西裤，一件白色衬衫和橙色领带。在我与他目光相接之前，这一切是我所能看到的全部，随即他猛地后退，试图当着我的面把门关上。

As if expecting him to do that I place my foot in between the door and doorframe and I yelp out in pain as the door collides with my foot.  
仿佛预料到他会这么做，我将脚卡在门和门框之间，随着门撞到我的脚，我痛得叫出声来。

"Wait!" I manage to choke out through the pain, "I'm not... I'm not here to hurt you, you idiot!"  
"等等！" 我忍痛喊道，"我不是……我不是来伤害你的，你这个白痴！"

I realize angrily calling him an idiot might not be too persuasive as he continues to try to shut the door on me. He's strong and I consider withdrawing my foot, letting him shut the door and walking away. Unfortunately for my foot an older part of me has taken over and I'm not willing to let him win.  
我意识到愤怒地叫他白痴可能不太有说服力，因为他继续试图把门关上。他很强壮，我考虑收回脚，让他关门然后走开。不幸的是，我内心深处的一部分已经占据了主导，我不愿意让他赢。

I lean myself up against the door and look around the corridor hoping that no one else here can hear this exchange or comes out right now. The last thing I need is for someone to see me doing this. I push against the door, "Listen to me! I'm not... I'm here to deliver that damn letter you dropped yesterday!"  
我靠在门上，环顾走廊，希望没有其他人能听到这段对话或现在出来。我最不希望的就是有人看到我这样做。我推着门，"听我说！我不是……我是来送你昨天掉的那封该死的信的！"

My words seem to have had some effect on him as I feel the force stop from his end, something my poor right foot is very grateful for. I stay exactly where I am not pushing on the door anymore but keeping it propped open. I'm sure I can hear him take a step away from me before I hear a weak voice, "Could... Could you please post it and leave?"  
我的话似乎对他产生了些许影响，我感觉到他那边的力道停止了，这让我的右脚感到十分庆幸。我保持原位不动，不再推门，只是让它保持敞开。我确信我能听到他后退一步的声音，然后是一个微弱的声音传来，“能……能请你贴好并离开吗？”

This is really the Fifth Child and final Angel? The one who nearly doomed all of mankind? This is the person who made Rei so angry just by seeing his name? I consider his request, maybe I should just leave him alone but again I feel that compulsion to find out more. I want to know why he is so terrified.  
这真的是第五使徒，也是最后的使徒吗？那个几乎让全人类陷入绝境的存在？就是这个人，仅仅因为他的名字就让绫波如此愤怒？我考虑着他的请求，也许我应该让他独自一人，但那种探究更多的冲动再次涌现。我想知道他为何如此恐惧。

I push the door slightly and I see him stood on the far side of the corridor his eyes wide with fear. He backs himself up into the corner like some sort of frightened puppy. I hesitate to move any closer and feel my own heart rate increase. I'm really having this effect on him, I'm really scaring him this much because of this aren't I? I should leave, I should never have come here at all.  
我轻轻推开门，看到他站在走廊的另一端，眼中满是恐惧。他像一只受惊的小狗一样退到角落。我犹豫着是否再靠近，感到自己的心跳也在加速。我真的对他有这么大的影响吗？我真的让他如此害怕，这都是因为我，对吧？我应该离开，我根本就不该来这里。

I stand there awkwardly in the doorway before repeating, "I'm not here to hurt you."  
我尴尬地站在门口，然后重复道：“我不是来伤害你的。”

He looks at me with a look of disbelief and I take a step back. His eyes... they're the same eyes I had seen from another certain person in the past. That fear of the monster I am, does Kaworu know about me then? Does he know what I was? Is that why he is so scared of me?  
他用一种难以置信的表情看着我，我后退了一步。他的眼睛……和我过去在某个特定人物身上见过的眼睛一模一样。我内心的怪物所带来的恐惧，碇真嗣知道我的事吗？他知道我是什么样的人吗？是不是因为这个他才这么怕我？

I weakly smile and hold out the envelope, "Here... Take it, I'll... I'll go. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I scared you that much."  
我虚弱地笑了笑，递出信封，“给……拿着吧，我……我会走的。对不起，我没意识到我吓到你了。”

Kaworu looks at me again before taking a tentative step forward. He slowly reaches out and takes the envelope from me before looking at the form within. I see his eyes light up for a moment and he half smiles at me.  
渚薰再次看向我，然后小心翼翼地向前迈了一步。他缓缓伸出手，从我这里接过信封，然后看向里面的表格。我看到他的眼睛亮了一下，然后对我露出了半个微笑。

"T-Thank you." He says as he takes a step back, "I... I appreciate you bringing this."  
“谢、谢谢你。”他说着后退了一步，“我……我很感激你带这个来。”

I shrug, "Yeah well... it was no big deal. Look I'll just go, I just thought... Never mind... You should probably look at getting that front door fixed too."  
我耸耸肩，“嗯，也没什么大不了的。瞧，我这就走了，我只是觉得……算了……你或许也该考虑修一下前门。”

I turn around to leave and hear him speak, "It is... a big deal to me... I am really grateful."  
我转身准备离开，听到他说：“这对我来说……很重要……我真的很感激。”

I freeze up, some communication finally, "Good."  
我愣住了，终于有了交流，“很好。”

I don't leave my spot in the door yet and wonder If he is about to say anything else. After thirty seconds of awkwardness he does, "I... I should apologize about yesterday... I hope... I did not hurt you..."  
我还没有离开门口的位置，心想他是否还要说些什么。三十秒的尴尬过后，他开口了：“我……我应该为昨天道歉……希望……我没有伤害到你……”

I finally turn around to face him, "It's fine... I just... Why did you run away from me?"  
我终于转过身面对他，“没事的……我只是……你为什么要从我身边逃走？”

He averts his eyes from me, I'm sure I see some redness of embarrassment come to his pale cheeks, "I… I thought you were going to hurt me… That you knew who I was… but you know that now don't you?"  
他避开了我的目光，我确信我看到他苍白的脸颊上泛起了尴尬的红晕，“我……我以为你要伤害我……以为你知道我是谁……但现在你知道了，对吧？”

I nod my head, "I didn't yesterday but I've had a few of the blanks filled in for me now."  
我点点头，“昨天我还不知道，但现在我已经填补了一些空白。”

He glances at me before backing himself up against the wall, "Then you know what I was and what it was I did?"  
他瞥了我一眼，然后背靠墙退后，“那么你知道我曾是怎样的人，以及我做过什么吗？”

I nod again, "Yes I do…"  
我再次点头，“是的，我知道……”

"How much do you know?"  
“你知道多少？”

"Enough. I know that you were sent to NERV to replace me and I know you ended up being an Angel." I tell him realizing there is no point beating around the bush, "I know that you befriended… "  
“够了。我知道你是被派来 NERV 取代我的，我也知道你最终成了使徒。”我告诉他，意识到拐弯抹角毫无意义，“我知道你和他成了朋友……”

I trail off for some reason finding myself unable to say his name. Kaworu is looking at me with a wounded expression, "I know that you hurt him too."  
我不知为何突然说不下去了，无法说出他的名字。渚薰看着我，脸上带着受伤的表情，“我知道你也伤害了他。”

He recoils at my words and shakes his head, "No it was not… I had no choice… I…"  
他听到我的话后退了一步，摇着头说，“不，不是那样的……我别无选择……我……”

He looks directly at me now, "It was too much… SEELE and the compulsions I felt I… I didn't want to hurt him. I didn't want to hurt anyone but…"  
他现在直视着我，“那太过分了……SEELE 和我感受到的强迫……我……我不想伤害他。我不想伤害任何人，但是……”

"But you did." “但你还是做了。”

"Yes… I did…" He admits, "And I regret it, I've regretted it every day since I returned… I should not be here… I should…"  
“是的……我做了……”他承认道，“而且我后悔了，自从我回来后，每一天都在后悔……我不该在这里……我应该……”

"Stop it." I order him not wishing to hear him say these things. It's not that I don't have sympathy for him but because those are the same words I've used countless times in the past about myself. I hate hearing them in my own head, never mind from someone else.  
"别说了。" 我不愿听他说这些，命令道。并非我对他没有同情，而是那些话我也曾无数次对自己说过。我讨厌在脑海中听到它们，更别提从别人口中听到。

I try to move the subject on, "So what are you now?"  
我试图转移话题，"那你现在是什么？"

"I'm as human as you or anyone else is." He answers me immediately. It was just as I suspected and the fear he is feeling starts to make sense. He's not only going to be afraid of me but everyone else. He doesn't have whatever powers he could rely on as an Angel to protect him and his human side has taken over.  
"我和你或其他人一样，都是人类。" 他立刻回答。正如我所料，他内心的恐惧开始变得合理。他不仅会害怕我，还会害怕所有人。他不再拥有作为天使时可依赖的任何力量，人类的特质已经占据主导。

An awkward silence falls upon us as I step further into the hallway, his front door closes extinguishing an amount of the light that was coming in. In the darkness I can still make him out and I can see his red eyes looking towards me reflecting the little light that is coming in from one of the other rooms. Finally he speaks, "W-Would you like to come inside?"  
我走进走廊，一阵尴尬的沉默随之降临。他的前门关闭，熄灭了部分透进来的光线。在黑暗中，我仍能辨认出他的身影，他的红眼睛朝我看来，反射着从其他房间透入的微弱光线。终于，他开口了，“你……你想进来吗？”

His question takes me by surprise and I find myself nodding and following him into his front room. His front room is immaculate, not surprising considering the total lack of anything in it. He has a simple black couch placed in one part of the room with a television opposite. A small coffee table sits in between the two.  
他的问题让我有些意外，我不由自主地点头，跟着他走进了客厅。他的客厅一尘不染，考虑到里面空无一物，这并不令人惊讶。房间的一角摆放着一张简单的黑色沙发，对面是一台电视机。两者之间放着一张小咖啡桌。

On one of the far walls is a small piano with a bookcase next to it filled up with what I presume to be music books. Next to that is a table with a music player on it. There is nothing else in the room, no plants, pictures or ornaments. The walls are a plain and dull white making it look as if he has just moved in here.  
在远处的墙边，有一架小钢琴，旁边是一个书架，里面塞满了我认为是乐谱的书。旁边还有一张桌子，上面放着一台音乐播放器。房间里再无其他物品，没有植物，没有照片，也没有装饰品。墙壁是单调乏味的白色，让人感觉他好像刚搬进来不久。

"How long have you been here?" I ask him.  
"你在这里多久了？" 我问他。

"Almost six months…" He replies, "I… returned in January and spent a month in the facility there."  
"差不多六个月了……" 他回答，"我……一月份回来的，在那里待了一个月。"

Six months here and this is all he has, even Rei didn't take that long to start amassing things. I wonder how Kaworu lives and what he does. He can't just sit and play piano all the time, he can't just listen to music all the time. Does he not have anything else?  
在这里六个月了，他只有这些，连丽都没花这么长时间就开始积攒东西。我想知道渚薰是怎么生活的，他都做些什么。他总不能一直坐着弹钢琴，也不能一直听音乐。他就没有别的事情做吗？

"So you came to Berlin after being in the facility, do you know people here?"  
“所以你离开设施后来了柏林，你在这里有认识的人吗？”

He shakes his head, "I… not really. It was Fuyutsuki… he offered me an opportunity here. I work for him, he's helped me a great deal."  
他摇摇头，“我……不太认识。是冬月……他给了我这里的机会。我为他工作，他帮了我很多。”

I don't know if I should be surprised at that. Fuyutsuki has, since we all returned been making an attempt to make up for what he was a part of. In the early days he visited each of us and ensured we got fair treatment and suitable payouts and support for what we all went through. I can imagine that he is also behind ensuring those people still watch over me, despite me saying I wanted nothing to do with any of them.  
我不知道这是否该让我惊讶。自从我们回来后，冬月一直在努力弥补他所参与的事情。起初，他拜访了我们每一个人，确保我们得到了公正的待遇和适当的补偿，以及对我们经历的支持。我能想象他也在幕后确保那些人继续关注我，尽管我说过不想和他们有任何瓜葛。”

"Fuyutsuki huh? So he is still trying to help people is he… even if they used to be an Angel…"  
"冬月啊？看来他还是在尽力帮助人们，即便他们曾经是天使……"

I feel bad almost immediately after saying it, even more so when I see him flinch, "He has… been very helpful and kind to me."  
我几乎立刻就感到内疚，尤其是看到他退缩的样子，“他……对我非常友好和热心。”

"Good. I'm glad." I state flatly before taking another look around this barren and somewhat alien room. It unnerves me, it's so sterile and basic. It doesn't feel lived in at all.  
"那就好。我很高兴。"我平淡地说道，然后再次环顾这个荒凉且略显异样的房间。它让我感到不安，如此无菌和简陋，完全没有生活气息。

"Thank you once again… for bringing the form I mean. It is… It is really important to me."  
"再次感谢你……我是说，把表格带给我。这对我……真的很重要。"

I shrug, "Don't mention it, so what exactly is it anyway that's so important?"  
我耸耸肩，"别客气，那到底是什么事情这么重要？"

"I am applying to become a music tutor." He wanders over to his piano and smiles, "As you have probably noticed I don't have much here. I… don't really know how to live yet, most of my life was spent in isolation with minimal contact with other people. Music is… one thing I have always had though and playing the piano is one thing I am able to do and I would like to share my gift with others."  
"我正在申请成为一名音乐导师。"他走到钢琴旁，微笑着说，"你可能已经注意到了，我这里没什么东西。我……还不太会生活，大部分时间我都是独自一人，很少与他人接触。音乐……是我一直拥有的东西，弹钢琴是我能做到的事情之一，我想把这份天赋分享给其他人。"

At least he knows what he wants, that is something. I walk over to his piano and take a look at it with him. It's a nice looking instrument but the thing that really catches my eye is the piece that he has displayed on the stand. I have to do a double take, "You're learning Firth of Fifth?"  
"至少他知道自己想要什么，这已经很难得了。我走到他的钢琴旁，和他一起端详起来。这架钢琴外观很漂亮，但真正吸引我目光的是他放在谱架上的那首曲子。我不得不再次确认，“你在学《五度峡湾》？””

He smiles at me, "You know the song?"  
"他朝我微笑，“你知道这首歌？””

I grin, "Of course I know it! It was one of my…"  
"我咧嘴一笑，“当然知道！它曾是我……””

I trail off partway through my sentence and shake my head. I don't really want to explain to this guy I barely know just why that sort of music resonates with me. I used to tell people it's because it was music for smarter people, that the musical complexity was made for people like me and the lyrical depth was something you wouldn't get in their simpler forms of music.  
我话说到一半就停了下来，摇了摇头。我并不想向这个几乎不认识的家伙解释为什么那种音乐会触动我。我曾告诉别人，那是因为这种音乐是为更聪明的人准备的，其音乐复杂性是为我这样的人量身定做，而歌词的深度是他们在更简单的音乐形式中所找不到的。

It was of course all bullshit. The real reason I know and like this song and this sort of music is because my mother liked it. One of the few things I have left of her is her record collection. I would listen to the songs repeatedly, absorbed in the stories they tell and the musical journeys they took me on. It was one of the few things that allowed me to get close to my mother. He looks at me expecting me to finish my sentence, instead I smirk at him, "Play it."  
当然，这一切都是胡说。我之所以知道并喜欢这首歌和这种音乐，真正的原因是我母亲喜欢它。我母亲留下的少数几样东西之一就是她的唱片收藏。我会反复聆听这些歌曲，沉浸在它们讲述的故事和带我踏上的音乐旅程中。这是让我接近母亲的少数几件事之一。他看着我，期待我完成句子，而我却对他微微一笑，"放吧。"

"Play… Firth of Fifth?" "放……《Firth of Fifth》？"

"Yes! Play it! I want to hear you!"  
"好啊！弹吧！我想听你弹！"

"O-Oh but I…" "哦-哦，但我…"

"Oh come on." I challenge him, "You want to be a tutor right? You have to get used to having an audience."  
"哎呀，别这样。" 我向他挑战，"你想当家教对吧？你得习惯有观众。"

"Okay… I shall try…" “好的…我试试…”

I step away from the piano and he takes his seat and looks over the sheet a couple of times. I watch as he stretches his hands out and I watch as his hands hover over the piano keys for a moment. I wonder if he is really going to do it, he seems hesitant but then he nods his head four times and his slender pale fingers come down on the keys launching into the wondrous introduction of the song.  
我离开钢琴，他坐下，几次翻看乐谱。我看着他伸展双手，然后悬停在琴键上方片刻。我好奇他是否真的会弹，他似乎有些犹豫，但随后他点了四次头，纤细苍白的手指落在琴键上，奏出了乐曲美妙的引子。

I remain still, my mouth slightly open in awe as he plays the entire introduction to the song flawlessly. I look and see his face deep in concentration as his hands glide across the piano. It's such a far cry from that frightened puppy of a boy I had witnessed only moments ago. A minute and some later he brings it to an end and I give him some light applause, "Very good."  
我静静地站着，惊讶得微微张嘴，他完美无瑕地弹完了整段引子。我看着他专注的脸庞，双手在钢琴上流畅地移动。这与片刻前那个惊慌失措的男孩判若两人。一分钟后，他结束了演奏，我轻轻鼓掌，“非常好。”

"Y-You think so?" He looks embarrassed by the praise.  
"你-你这么认为吗？" 他对这番赞扬显得有些不好意思。

"Of course! So you like this sort of music?"  
"当然！那你喜欢这种音乐吗？"

He nods enthusiastically, "Very much so, I just find it a shame that many of these artists are no longer active. I have exhausted a lot of their discographies."  
他热情地点头，"非常喜欢，我只是觉得遗憾的是，许多这些艺术家已经不再活跃了。我已经听遍了他们很多专辑。"

I laugh, "Well a lot of those bands were quite turbulent or they changes drastically."  
我笑着说：“很多乐队都经历过动荡或剧变。”

"Yes, this one was no exception, two of their members leaving only a few years apart and their sound changing. Tell me, which era do you prefer?"  
“是的，这个乐队也不例外，两位成员在短短几年内相继离开，风格也发生了变化。告诉我，你更喜欢哪个时期的他们？”

I shrug, "I like both, sometimes I found the earlier stuff a bit too wordy but sometimes the later stuff could be a bit too poppy or droning. There is a lot to like from both sides though."  
我耸耸肩，“两个时期我都喜欢，有时候觉得早期的作品过于冗长，但有时候后期的作品又可能过于流行化或单调。不过两边都有很多值得喜欢的地方。”

"I see, I admit I find myself preferring the older material but later tracks such as Domino, Home by the Sea and Fading Lights are wonderful."  
"我明白了，我得承认我个人更喜欢早期的作品，但后来的曲目如《多米诺》、《海边之家》和《渐暗之光》也非常精彩。"

"They are." I reply and then I'm hit by a strange idea.  
"确实如此。" 我回答道，随即脑海中闪过一个奇怪的念头。"

"Say… Kaworu there is… a band playing nearby tonight… a tribute act funnily enough and they cover only the earlier material. I have two tickets for it and I was going to go with a friend but she unfortunately had to leave to go home earlier today."  
"这么说吧，卡沃鲁，今晚附近有一支乐队演出……说来有趣，这是一支致敬乐队，他们只演奏早期的作品。我有两张票，原本打算和朋友一起去，但她不幸今天早些时候回家了。"

He looks at me, "Oh… That is unfortunate."  
他看着我，“哦……那真是遗憾。”

I can't help but think that for Kaworu it's actually quite fortunate considering just what it is Rei wants to do to him. I probably shouldn't mention Rei right now, a part of me thinks I shouldn't even be doing this but something inside me feels bad for the guy. He's been here six months and it's obvious he hasn't experienced… anything. Going to a concert will be good for him and he'll have me to protect him from anything.  
我不禁想到，对渚来说，这其实相当幸运，考虑到丽想要对他做什么。我或许现在不该提丽，一部分的我甚至觉得我不该做这件事，但内心深处，我为这家伙感到难过。他在这里已经六个月了，显然他什么都没经历过……去听一场音乐会对他有好处，而且有我在，可以保护他免受任何事情的干扰。

"So would you like the spare ticket?"  
“那么，你想不想要这张多余的票？”

"I-I do not know… I… there will be many people there… I…"  
"我…我不知道…我…那里会有很多人…我…"

"You have nothing to worry about, no one knows who you are and besides you're going to be with me. I'll make sure no harm comes to you."  
"你不用担心，没人知道你是谁，而且你还会和我在一起。我会确保你不会受到任何伤害。"

He smiles, "In which case… I would like that… thank you."  
他微笑着说："那么…我很愿意…谢谢你。"

### Chapter 4: Mr Blue Sky?  
第四章：蓝天先生？  

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

**Tokyo-2 – Morning 东京-2 —— 清晨**

I step through into the arrivals lounge, my backpack feels heavy on my shoulders and I'm wheeling my pale blue case behind me as I look around for Misato. A group of people move past me, rushing towards their loved ones or just taxi drivers waiting to pick them up as I try to spot her purple hair through the semi busy terminal. I move forward and before long I can hear her excitedly yelling my name.  
我穿过通道进入到达大厅，背包沉甸甸地压在肩上，我拖着淡蓝色的行李箱四处寻找美里。一群人从我身边匆匆走过，有的奔向心爱的家人，有的则是等待接客的出租车司机，我试图在半忙碌的航站楼中寻找她那紫色的头发。我向前走去，不久便听到她兴奋地喊我的名字。

"Rei!" “丽！”

I glance upwards and smile as I finally catch sight of my adoptive mother. She quickly moved towards me and nearly knocks me off my feet as she pulls me into a tight embrace, "How was your flight?"  
我抬头望去，终于看到了我的养母，脸上露出微笑。她迅速向我走来，紧紧拥抱我，几乎让我站不稳，“飞行怎么样？”

"It was pleasant, although I do not think you should have gone to all the effort to arranging all of that for me. I would have been happy to have done it myself."  
"虽然我觉得你不该费心为我安排这一切，我自己也能搞定，但这种感觉确实不错。"

She breaks the hug and shakes her head, "It wouldn't have been fair to expect you to do it yourself considering I was the one who asked you to come back so suddenly. Besides it wasn't me who arranged your upgrades."  
她松开拥抱，摇了摇头，"考虑到是我突然叫你回来的，让你自己安排就不太公平了。而且，给你升级的事也不是我安排的。"

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, "Who was it?"  
我好奇地挑了挑眉，"那是谁？"

"Fuyutsuki, after I informed him of what had happened and said you were on your way back he pulled some strings."  
"冬月，我告诉他发生的事情后，他说你正在回来，于是他动用了一些关系。"

"I see, in which case I shall have to think him if I encounter him." I frown in my reply, my business class experience somewhat soured by the knowledge of who arranged it. If I had known it was he who arranged that I would have asked to remain in economy class.  
"我明白了，那样的话我得感谢他，如果遇到他的话。" 我皱着眉头回答，我的商务舱体验因为知道是谁安排的而有些变味。如果早知道是他安排的，我可能会要求留在经济舱。

I am not by any means ungrateful for the experience. I am thankful, I found the seating to be far more comfortable than economy and the ability to turn them into an actual bed meant I was able to sleep on the flight. In addition the vegetarian options offered to me on the menu were many.  
我绝不是不感激这次经历。我很感激，我发现座位比经济舱舒适得多，而且能够变成真正的床，这意味着我可以在飞行中睡觉。此外，菜单上提供的素食选项也很多。

Still, it also means Fuyutsuki did me a favour and he is someone I do not wish to speak to. It is something I share with Asuka, we both desire distance from that person but for differing reasons. She because she wishes to cut off all contact with that part of her life, me because of what that man reminds me of and what I used to be.  
尽管如此，这也意味着冬月帮了我一个忙，而我并不想与他交谈。这是我与明日香共有的感受，我们都希望远离那个人，但原因各异。她是因为想要切断与那段生活的所有联系，而我则是因为那个人让我想起过去的自己。

I am of a similar opinion when it comes to Ritsuko Akagi too, something which I know upsets Misato and even Shinji. I know the two of them wish to move on and I will make the effort when necessary. I do not dislike Fuyutsuki or Akagi, I just wish to maintain distance from them.  
对于赤木律子，我的看法也类似，我知道这让美里和真嗣感到不安。我知道他们俩希望向前看，必要时我会努力配合。我并不讨厌冬月或赤木，只是希望与他们保持距离。

We finally reach Misato's car and she takes my case and backpack from me and places it in the boot. She eyes my backpack curiously and I can already guess at what she is thinking. I simply shake my head at her, "Yes I did buy you both souvenirs and you can find out what they are later."  
我们终于到达美里的车旁，她从我手中接过手提箱和背包，放入后备箱。她好奇地打量着我的背包，我已猜到她在想什么。我只是对她摇摇头，“是的，我给你们俩买了纪念品，你们稍后就会知道是什么了。”

She nods and grins at me, "Well that's something to look forward to!"  
她点点头，对我咧嘴一笑，“嗯，那倒是值得期待的事！”

I climb into the car and put my seatbelt on, she climbs into her side and a few moments later we're leaving the carpark and moving back towards the city and to our apartment. The first part of our journey is silent and so I take the opportunity to speak to Misato about what has happened.  
我爬进车里，系好安全带，她坐到她的位置上，片刻后我们驶离停车场，朝着城市和我们的公寓方向返回。旅程的前半段我们沉默无言，于是我趁机向美里询问发生了什么。

"I presume it was you who contacted Fuyutsuki to ask about Nagisa?"  
“我猜是你联系了冬月，询问了关于渚的事吧？”

Misato nods her head, "Yeah, he already knew about Nagisa."  
美里点点头，“嗯，他已经知道渚的事了。”

"How?" I lean my elbow on the edge of the window and prop my head up on my hand looking outside at the buildings we pass. So Fuyutsuki already knew about Nagisa but failed to inform any of us.  
“怎么知道的？”我把手肘撑在窗边，用手托着头，望着窗外掠过的建筑。原来副校长早就知道渚的事，却没告诉我们任何人。

"Seems Nagisa returned at the start of the year. They picked him up at the emergence facility and treated him initially for emergence sickness. Apparently he was… in quite a state when he recovered his memories."  
“看来渚是在年初回来的。他们在紧急设施找到了他，并初步治疗了他的觉醒症状。显然，当他恢复记忆时……状态相当糟糕。”

I scowl at hearing Misato's words and I can't tell if she is feeling some sort of sympathy for what Kaworu has went through. I'm not sure I feel sympathetic at all, in the back of my mind all I can hear is a voice saying 'good.' I keep that voice away though, I don't like  
听到美里的话，我皱起了眉头，不确定她是否对渚所经历的一切感到同情。我内心深处并不觉得有什么值得同情的，只有一个声音在说‘活该’。但我尽量压制这个声音，我不喜欢……

"It seems…" Misato pauses, "That Nagisa is no longer an Angel. They ran tests whilst he was there and he is completely human now."  
“看来……”美里顿了顿，“渚已经不再是天使了。他们在那里对他进行了测试，他现在完全是个普通人。”

"I see…" My frown deepens and I wonder if this fact should make me feel any better about the fact that he is out there walking around freely. Regardless of whether he is human now or not it was what he was and what he did that concerns me. He was an Angel, he tried to destroy this world and he broke my brother's heart. He manipulated him when he was at his lowest point and tore his world apart.  
“我明白了……”我的眉头皱得更深了，不知道这个事实是否应该让我对他能自由行走感到好受些。不管他现在是不是人类，让我担忧的是他曾经的身份和所做的事。他曾是天使，试图毁灭这个世界，还伤了我哥哥的心。他在哥哥最脆弱的时候操纵了他，将他的世界撕得粉碎。

The fact that he is just walking around freely angers me. He should not be allowed to do so, I know we have all done bad things in the past, we all made mistakes but what he did was no mistake.  
他竟然能自由自在地四处走动，这让我非常愤怒。他不应该被允许这样做，我知道我们过去都做过坏事，我们都犯过错误，但他所做的绝非错误。

"Why did they let him go? He was an Angel, he tried…"  
“他们为什么放他走？他曾是天使，他尝试过……”

"I asked Fuyutsuki this. It seems that he was let go because Fuyutsuki offered him a job. Fuyutsuki saw him as a victim of what had happened and offered to help him."  
“我问过冬月这件事。似乎是因为冬月给了他一份工作，他才被放走的。冬月认为他是所发生事件的受害者，并提出帮助他。”

"Kaworu Nagisa is no victim, he is a monster." I state flatly and look at Misato. She too is frowning and I imagine she has very similar thoughts to me.  
"渚薰并非受害者，他是个怪物。" 我平淡地说道，看向美里。她也皱着眉头，我想她的想法应该和我差不多。

"Fuyutsuki didn't seem to think so and… urged us to let the thing with Nagisa slide." Misato shakes her head as she speaks, "He didn't go into detail but he told me that Nagisa is as much a victim as you, Shinji or Asuka."  
"冬月似乎不这么认为，而且……他劝我们放过和渚薰有关的事。" 美里边说边摇头，"他没有详细说明，但他告诉我，渚薰和你、真嗣或明日香一样，都是受害者。"

"I doubt that." "我对此表示怀疑。"

"As do I but he said he can provide proof for us should we need it. He also assured me that there will be absolutely no risk to anyone and no one will see or hear from Nagisa should we desire it."  
“我也一样，但他表示可以为我们提供证据，如果我们需要的话。他还向我保证，绝对不会有任何人面临风险，如果我们希望的话，没有人会再见到或听到 Nagisa 的消息。”

I start to open my mouth to say something about the risk to Asuka but I quickly stop myself. I cannot break my promise to her but I also don't want her to be at risk. She is in the same city as Nagisa, she has already encountered him once and it can happen again. Her wish to have no contact with others and for no one else to know her whereabouts can be so frustrating at times but I will continue to respect that wish.  
我正要开口说关于 Asuka 的风险，但很快制止了自己。我不能违背对她的承诺，但也不想让她处于危险之中。她和 Nagisa 在同一个城市，她已经遇到过他一次，这种事可能还会发生。她希望不与他人接触，不让任何人知道她的行踪，这有时让人很沮丧，但我会继续尊重她的这个愿望。

My only hope is that she is okay, I will make sure to contact her later today to let her know I have arrived back in Japan. I do wish that I could have stayed with her for another night or two. It has been so long since I have seen her, I wished to play games or see a move with her but she insisted I returned to Japan when Misato asked me to. I believe she will be alright though, the chances of her encountering Nagisa again are slim.  
我唯一的希望是她一切安好，今天晚些时候我会联系她，告诉她我已经回到日本。我真希望能在她身边多待一两个晚上。我已经很久没见到她了，本想和她一起玩游戏或看电影，但她坚持让我在 Misato 要求我回来时返回日本。不过我相信她会没事的，她再次遇到 Nagisa 的几率很小。

Asuka is smart and strong, I'm sure she will be alright. So now my attention turns towards my brother Shinji. I wonder how he would react to such news, I look back at Misato, "Have you informed Shinji?"  
明日香既聪明又坚强，我相信她会没事的。现在，我的注意力转向了我的弟弟真嗣。我不知道他听到这样的消息会有什么反应，我回头看向美里，“你通知真嗣了吗？”

Misato shakes her head, "No… Not yet. I don't know if I should tell him or if I'm able to. I don't know how he would react to something like this, you know how he feels about Nagisa…"  
美里摇了摇头，“还没有……我还没说。我不知道该不该告诉他，也不知道我能不能做到。我不清楚他对此会有什么反应，你知道他对渚的感情……”

"Yes I do." “是的，我知道。”

Figuring out exactly how my brother will react is tough. He will of course be shocked by the news at first, I am not entirely sure if he is aware that Nagisa was very much like myself with the potential for spare bodies. I wonder if the news that Nagisa is alive might alleviate some of the guilt he still feels over the Angels' death. At the same time I wonder if that might not just give him something else to fear in this world.  
准确揣摩我哥哥的反应确实不易。他初闻消息自然会震惊，我不确定他是否知晓渚其实和我一样，拥有备份身体的可能性。我在想，得知渚还活着的消息能否减轻他因天使之死而背负的愧疚。但同时，我也担心这会不会只是让他在这个世界上又多了一样恐惧的东西。

"I think we should be honest with him thought." Misato says to me, "I think Shinji deserves honesty, if we hide the truth then… it might only make things worse should he eventually find out anyway."  
“我认为我们应该对他坦诚。”美里对我说，“我觉得真嗣应该得到诚实，如果我们隐瞒真相，万一他最终还是发现了……那只会让情况变得更糟。”

I nod, "I agree. It would be best to be honest, he should know."  
我点头，“我同意。最好还是诚实相告，他应该知道。”

I go back to staring out the window knowing the hypocrisy of my own words. Knowing that Asuka is well and safe and happy, I wonder what effect that would have on Shinji. I can still remember how miserable he was on the day she left, we were all unhappy with it. She left without any warning only leaving a simple message behind that she had returned to Germany and thanking Misato for taking care of her.  
我回到窗前，凝视着外面，深知自己话语中的虚伪。知道明日香安然无恙、幸福快乐，我不禁思索这对真嗣会有何影响。我仍记得她离开那天，他有多么痛苦，我们所有人都为此感到难过。她毫无预兆地离去，只留下一条简短的讯息，说她已返回德国，并感谢美里对她的照顾。

I did not understand why she had left then and I still don't understand. It was one of the first things I asked when I tracked her down and found her and her only answer was that she had to. I disagree with her, I do not think she had to but it was and is her decision. All I can do is respect that and her wishes. Still I do dislike keeping this secret from Shinji and Misato, yet it is the price of mine and Asuka's friendship, a friendship that I value so very much.  
那时我不明白她为何离开，至今依然不解。这是我找到她后问的第一个问题，而她的唯一回答是她必须这么做。我不同意她的看法，我认为她并非必须离开，但这是她的决定，过去是，现在是。我能做的只有尊重这一点和她的一切愿望。尽管如此，我仍不喜欢对真嗣和美里隐瞒这个秘密，然而这是我和明日香友谊的代价，这份友谊对我来说无比珍贵。

Being human is exhausting I think to myself as I feel my eyes start to grow heavier. The days of travelling and the revelations are starting to get to me despite me sleeping on the flight. I am looking forward to returning home where I can take a shower, where I can relax in my pyjamas and I can see my brother. Where I can sample his delicious cooking and I can feel safe and unafraid.  
作为人类真是累人，我心里想着，感觉眼皮开始变得沉重。尽管在飞机上睡了一觉，但连日的旅行和那些惊人的发现开始让我感到疲惫。我期待着回家，在那里我可以洗个澡，穿上睡衣放松，还能见到我的哥哥。在那里，我可以品尝他美味的烹饪，感到安全和无所畏惧。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin - Morning 柏林 - 清晨**

My eyes slowly open and the first thing I notice in my semi awake state is the strange pain I'm feeling in my neck. This is closely followed by a dull pain in my head and the realization that this thing my head is against is a solid object rather than my comfortable pillows. The thing wrapped halfway around my body is not my large duvet but is instead a thinner sheet that would be providing me with warmth were it not for it being on the floor now.  
我的眼睛缓缓睁开，半醒状态下首先注意到的是脖子上的奇怪疼痛。紧接着是头部的隐隐作痛，以及意识到我的头正靠在一个坚硬的物体上，而不是我舒适的枕头。缠绕在我身体一半的东西不是我那张大被子，而是一条较薄的床单，如果不是它现在掉在了地上，本该给我带来温暖的。

I force my eyes to fully open and find myself now looking up at an unfamiliar ceiling. I blink a couple of times and wonder if maybe this is some sort of strange dream I'll wake up from. I pause for a moment, that is strange, I don't remember my dreams from last night. I'm not exactly comfortable here but I also seemed to have slept well for the first time.  
我强迫自己完全睁开眼睛，发现自己正仰望着一个陌生的天花板。我眨了几下眼，疑惑这会不会是一场奇怪的梦，醒来就会消失。我停顿片刻，这很奇怪，我不记得昨晚的梦了。虽然这里并不舒适，但我似乎睡得很好，这是第一次。

This pleasant feeling doesn't last long as the realization of where I am suddenly hits me. It's immediately followed by the familiar feelings of fear that I'm so used to by now. I can remember what happened now. I know exactly where I am now and why I am lying on this sofa on what was, until yesterday, a stranger's home.  
这种愉悦的感觉并没有持续多久，因为我突然意识到自己在哪里。紧接着，我习惯了的恐惧感立刻袭来。我现在能记起发生了什么。我清楚地知道自己在哪里，以及为什么躺在这个沙发上，而这个沙发直到昨天还属于一个陌生人的家。

Last night she... She invited me to that concert and it was such a wondrous experience. I don't think my heart has ever experienced such joy before. To witness those people playing that music, music I have come to enjoy and love so perfectly was a sight to behold and will surely be one of my most treasured memories.  
昨晚她……她邀请我去那场音乐会，那是一次如此美妙的体验。我想我的心从未感受过如此的喜悦。亲眼目睹那些人演奏那美妙的音乐，那是我逐渐喜爱并深爱的音乐，真是令人难忘的景象，必将是我最珍贵的记忆之一。

We left the concert and Asuka asked if I would like to go for a drink with her. I politely declined at first but she insisted upon it. I was uncertain of it, fearful of what would happen if I drank alcohol. I am vaguely aware from the actions I have heard on evenings and the... mess that once littered the pavement near my home of the effect it can have on people.  
我们离开了音乐会，明日香问我是否愿意和她一起去喝一杯。我起初礼貌地拒绝了，但她坚持要我去。我对喝酒这件事感到不确定，害怕酒精会带来的后果。我隐约知道，从我听说的那些夜晚的举动和...我家附近曾经散落一地的混乱，酒精对人的影响有多大。

I think she knew I was scared though and she promised to look after me. I had enjoyed her company throughout the night so decided to take her up on her offer. It would not hurt to try a new experience. The place she took me to was small and quiet. I don't know her very well yet but I felt like we had something in common, I felt like the pain and fear that I feel is something she is familiar with.  
我想她知道我害怕，但她承诺会照顾我。那一晚我享受了她的陪伴，所以决定接受她的提议。尝试一种新的体验并不会有什么坏处。她带我去的地方很小也很安静。我虽然对她了解不多，但感觉我们有些共同之处，我觉得我所感受到的痛苦和恐惧，她也很熟悉。

Whilst there I drank two and a half pints of beer, much to Asuka's amusement that was enough to affect me. I was giddy, very happy but incapable of walking in a straight line. Asuka laughed me me, I laughed at myself. I haven't laughed like that before, I haven't felt joy like this before.  
在那里，我喝了两大杯半的啤酒，这让明日香觉得很有趣，因为这已经足以让我受到影响。我感到非常开心，但走路却歪歪扭扭。明日香笑我，我也自嘲地笑了。我以前从未这样笑过，从未感受过这样的快乐。

Asuka on the other hand did not seem to be too affected by what it was she drank. I suppose she is more tolerant of it than I am but she did start to slur her words at one point. When it was time for us to leave the small pub, she declared that I was of course in no fit state to go to my apartment alone. That is why I am now here lying on the couch of Asuka Langley Soryu.  
另一方面，明日香似乎并没有受到她所喝东西的太大影响。我想她对这东西的耐受力比我强，但她确实在某一刻开始口齿不清。当我们离开那家小酒馆时，她宣称我当然不适合独自回公寓。这就是我现在躺在明日香·兰格雷沙发上的原因。

I gaze absent mindedly around the dimly lit room. This place is a far cry from my own and I now start to realize with some sadness just how alien I must seem to anyone else. I can understand now why she was looking around my own apartment so strangely. My place is... It's practically empty and devoid of any colour or life. Her place is decorated, it's messy but it is welcoming.  
我心不在焉地环顾着昏暗的房间。这个地方与我自己的住处相去甚远，我现在开始有些悲伤地意识到，我一定显得多么格格不入。我现在能理解为什么她在我自己的公寓里四处张望时那么奇怪了。我的地方……几乎空无一物，缺乏任何色彩或生机。她的地方装饰着，虽然凌乱但很温馨。

Ahead of me I spot a television set and an array of games consoles set up underneath it. Either side of the television are two tall bookcases filled with books, DVDs and video games. Between myself and the television is a small coffee table, there is a used plate on it, some empty cups and a half-read book.  
我面前有一台电视机和一系列游戏机设置在它下面。电视两侧是两个高大的书架，里面塞满了书籍、DVD 和视频游戏。在我和电视机之间有一个小咖啡桌，上面有一个用过的盘子，一些空杯子，还有一本半读的书。

Is this how a real human actually lives? Is this what a true lived-in home looks and feels like? Since I returned I've always been hyper aware of just how alien I must seem to others. My way of speaking is not normal by anyone's standards and my appearance is a constant reminder of what I am and was.  
这就是人类真实的生活状态吗？一个真正充满生活气息的家，看起来和感觉起来就是这样的吗？自从我回来后，我一直异常清楚自己对他人来说是多么的异类。我的说话方式在任何人看来都不正常，我的外表也时刻提醒着我是谁，我曾经是什么。

I know so little of human ways and customs, I only know what was ingrained into me from my 'birth.' I have this new-found freedom but I find myself at a loss at what exactly to do with it. I am constantly intrigued by things but I don't know where I should start. Asuka's home is a reminded of that, I look again and I see at least three games consoles under her television. I would not know what to do with even one of them. I wouldn't know what to buy and why to buy it, I wouldn't know about the games I should play or what I would enjoy.  
我对人类的习俗和生活方式知之甚少，我只知道从我‘出生’时就被灌输的那点知识。我有了这新发现的自由，却发现自己不知道该如何利用它。我对许多事物都充满好奇，但不知道该从何开始。明日香的家让我想起了这一点，我再次环顾四周，发现她的电视机下至少有三台游戏主机。我甚至不知道该如何使用其中一台。我不知道该买什么，为什么要买，也不知道该玩哪些游戏，或者我会喜欢什么。

All I have really is my job and my music. My music I have because it was something ingrained into me and Kodama helped me explore more contemporary artists. My job because of Fuyutsuki, even the music tuition I want to do I had to be guided into.  
我真正拥有的只有我的工作和我的音乐。我的音乐是因为它被灌输给我，而 Kodama 帮助我探索了更多当代艺术家。我的工作是因为 Fuyutsuki，甚至连我想做的音乐课程，也必须有人引导我进入。

I slowly start to sit up and I let the sheet fully fall to the floor. I look across to a nearby chair and see the clothes I was wearing yesterday neatly folded up for me. I begin to feel my cheeks glow slightly red at my situation. It is strange but in my past life I did not feel much in the way of embarrassment when it came to my body but in my past life I never woke up in only my underwear in a stranger's home.  
我缓缓坐起身，任由床单完全滑落到地板上。我环顾四周，看到不远处的椅子上整齐地叠放着我昨天穿的衣服。我的脸颊不由自主地微微泛红，感到有些尴尬。这种感觉很奇怪，因为在我的前世，我对于自己的身体并没有太多羞涩之情，但前世的我从未在陌生人家中醒来时只穿着内衣。

Also, in my past life I never had to deal with certain urges that come with being human. That is... admittedly something I am still struggling with. It is not that I do not know how nor is it not that dealing with certain urges doesn't feel good it is just something I am unused to and something I struggle to not feel embarrassed or awkward about.  
此外，在前世，我从未需要应对作为人类特有的某些冲动。这一点……坦白说，我仍在努力适应。并非我不知道如何处理，也不是说应对这些冲动感觉不好，只是我还不习惯，而且我很难不感到尴尬或局促。

I pull the sheet back up and around my waist as I continue to look around the room. Despite being so visually different to my own apartment the layout is not too dissimilar. On the far end of a wall are two doors, I can see from here one of which leads into a bathroom and the other, closed, door I presume leads to Asuka's bedroom.  
我将床单重新拉起，围在腰间，继续打量着房间。尽管这里的视觉风格与我的公寓大相径庭，但布局却颇为相似。在远端的一堵墙上，有两扇门，从这里可以看到其中一扇通向浴室，而另一扇紧闭的门，我猜是通往明日香卧室的。

Much like my apartment the living room is also combined with a kitchen at the far end. Hers seems slightly larger than mine though. I look towards the closed door and I wonder how Asuka is and if she also slept well last night.  
和我的公寓一样，客厅的尽头也与厨房相连。不过她的似乎比我的稍大一些。我望向那扇紧闭的门，心中好奇明日香现在怎么样了，昨晚是否也睡得安稳。

I am still coming to terms with the fact that I am here. After our initial encounter I did not think that I would ever see her again, nor did I think it would be such a pleasant experience. I was certain that I did not deserve any of her kindness, in fact I am still certain that I don't. I cannot comprehend why she would be so nice to be especially now that she knows the truth of what I am. Yet I am grateful to her for it. When she wakes up I will have to thank her, whenever of course it is that she does wake up.  
我仍在努力接受自己身处此地的事实。初次相遇后，我从未想过会再次见到她，更没想到这会是一次愉快的经历。我确信自己不配得到她的任何善意，事实上，我现在依然这么认为。我无法理解她为何会对我如此友善，尤其是在她知道我的真实身份之后。然而，我对此心怀感激。等她醒来，我必须向她道谢，当然，是在她醒来的那一刻。

I reach across to the seat and grab my phone from the top of the pile. I smile as I turn it on and look at the time and see that it's nine thirty. I smile and lean back comfortably on the sofa. A second later my smile fades and I look at the phone again... Oh my god it's nine thirty! I should be at work now! I should have been at work half an hour ago! I should be at work but I'm not! I'm in the apartment of someone I barely know, wearing barely anything in a part of Berlin that I barely know!  
我伸手越过座位，从那堆东西上面抓起手机。我笑着打开它，看了看时间，发现已经是九点半了。我微笑着舒适地靠在沙发上。但一秒钟后，我的笑容消失了，我又看了一眼手机……天哪，九点半了！我现在应该在上班！我半小时前就应该在上班了！我应该在上班但我不在！我在这位几乎不认识的人的公寓里，穿着几乎没穿什么，在柏林一个我几乎不熟悉的地方！

I leap up off fo the couch, there is a loud band and pain as my toe hits the wooden coffee table. I suppress a yelp and lean over to pick up my trousers from the pile. How could this have happened? Did I sleep through my alarm? Why didn't it go off? Damnit, I wanted to put on fresh clothes as well!  
我从沙发上跳了起来，随着一声巨响和疼痛，我的脚趾撞到了木制咖啡桌上。我忍住了一声尖叫，弯腰从那堆东西里捡起我的裤子。这怎么可能发生？我是不是睡过了闹钟？为什么它没响？该死，我还想换上干净衣服呢！

I slide one leg into my trousers and try to put the other one in, no wait that isn't right. This isn't the right leg, damnit I'm trying to put these on the wrong way. I slide by leg back out of my trousers and take a step back to try to reassess this. There is another loud noise as once again my foot collides with the table, this time I can't suppress the yelp of pain.  
我把一条腿滑进裤子里，试图把另一条腿也放进去，不，等等，这样不对。这不是正确的腿，该死，我穿反了。我把腿从裤子里抽出来，后退一步，试图重新评估。又是一声巨响，我的脚再次撞到了桌子，这次我忍不住发出了一声痛苦的尖叫。

Nor can I keep my balance as I try to keep hold of the trousers and step into them. I feel them slip from my hands as I stagger backwards and try desperately to angle myself to land on the floor. My backside does not thank me as I land hard against the wooden floor.  
我也无法保持平衡，试图抓住裤子并迈进去。我感觉到它们从手中滑落，当我踉跄后退，拼命调整姿势以避免摔倒时。我的屁股并不感激我，因为我重重地摔在了木地板上。

I lie there for a brief moment dazed and in pain before getting back up and snatching my trousers off of the floor in anger. I hold them out properly and I'm ready to finally put the damn things on when I hear a door open and a light comes on in the room. All I can do is stand there awkwardly as I feel redness spread to my cheeks. I slowly turn my head to see a panicked looking Asuka staring directly at me.  
我在那里躺了一会儿，头晕目眩且疼痛，然后愤怒地从地板上抓起裤子。我正准备终于穿上这该死的东西时，听到门开了，房间里的灯也亮了。我只能尴尬地站在那里，感觉脸颊发红。我慢慢转过头，看到惊慌失措的明日香正直直地盯着我。

"Kaworu! Is everything alright I heard a-"  
“薰！一切都好吗？我听到有——”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin - Morning 柏林 - 清晨**

Admittedly of all the things I expected to see when I opened my bedroom door, Kaworu Nagisa stood angrily in just his underwear was at the bottom of the list, in fact I dare say it never even crossed my mind. It was strange enough having him in my apartment but to find him in this particular state even more so.  
说实话，当我打开卧室门时，我预想过无数可能的场景，但看到渚薰只穿着内裤站在那里生气，绝对是排在最底层的，甚至可以说我从未想过会有这种事。他在我的公寓里已经够奇怪了，但看到他这副模样更是让人难以置信。

Kaworu slowly turns his head and looks directly at me, I can see his eyes are wide with fear once again but at least this time I know it isn't because he's scared of me. Instead, judging by how red his face has gone it's probably because of the state I've spotted him in.  
渚薰缓缓转过头，直视着我，我能看到他的眼睛再次因恐惧而睁大，但至少这次我知道他不是因为我而害怕。相反，从他脸红的程度来看，可能是因为我看到了他这副模样。

I start to feel some redness come to my cheeks now as I realize we've been standing there looking at one another for at least thirty seconds now. I try to focus on his face as I speak, "I… heard a noise… is everything alright?"  
我开始感到脸颊泛红，意识到我们至少已经站在那里互相凝视了三十秒。我努力将注意力集中在他的脸上，开口问道：“我……听到了一些声响……一切都还好吗？”

His mouth opens and closes in a fashion similar to a goldfish and more awkward moments of silence pass between us. I'm trying so hard to keep me eyes on his face but I can't help but steal glances elsewhere. I look down at his body taking in the sight before me, he's slender but healthy and his pale skin almost glows in the light. I can see the top of his legs too, well toned, he did say that he likes to walk a lot.  
他的嘴巴张开又合上，动作像极了金鱼，更多尴尬的沉默在我们之间流逝。我拼命试图将目光锁定在他的脸上，但忍不住偷瞄其他地方。我低头看着他的身体，欣赏着眼前的景象，他身材修长却健康，苍白的皮肤在灯光下几乎闪着光。我还能看到他大腿的上部，肌肉线条分明，他确实说过自己喜欢多走路。

My eyes dart from his face to his legs, up to his chest and stomach. I'm doing all I can to not let them wander to other parts. I shouldn't be looking, I really shouldn't, and he's embarrassed enough but… I can't… my eyes look directly at the one covered part of him. His boxers are tight and I can see his rounded backside so well. I feel myself bite onto my bottom lip, it's… for lack of a better word, perfect.  
我的目光从他的脸游移到他的腿，再向上到他的胸膛和腹部。我竭尽全力不让视线飘向其他部位。我不该这样看，真的不该，而且他已经够尴尬了……但我无法……我的目光直直地落在他被遮盖的部分。他的内裤紧绷，我能清晰地看到他圆润的臀部。我感到自己咬住了下唇，找不到更好的词来形容，这真是……完美。

I really have to stop looking. I shouldn't be looking at his body like this. He's a guest in my home, he's a guest and practically a stranger. I… I have to stop, come on Asuka… if you want to look at… things you have websites for that.  
我真的不能再看了。我不应该这样盯着他的身体。他是住在我家的客人，是个客人，几乎是个陌生人。我……我得停下来，加油，明日香……如果你想看……那种东西，有专门的网站。

My eyes look at his ass once again. I hate myself for this but I guess one quick peek isn't bad, I mean… I am intrigued as to whether or not our former Angel is equipped and his boxers are tight. I allow my eyes to drift for just a second, I bite down harder on my lip.  
我的目光再次落在了他的臀部上。我讨厌自己这样，但我想，快速瞥一眼也没什么大不了的，我是说……我对我们曾经的使徒是否装备齐全以及他的内裤是否紧身感到好奇。我让我的目光飘移了一秒钟，咬紧了嘴唇。

"I… I tripped…" He finally speaks.  
“我……我绊倒了……”他终于开口说道。

My eyes go back up to his face and I release the painful grip my teeth have on my bottom lip. Instead I suppress a smirk as I realize what must have happened. The noise I heard was Kaworu falling. I can't help but wonder how.  
我的目光再次回到他的脸上，松开了紧咬下唇的疼痛。取而代之的是，我抑制住一个得意的微笑，因为我意识到发生了什么。我听到的声音是渚薰摔倒了。我不禁好奇他是怎么摔的。

"I was in a hurry, I… I fell when…"  
“我刚才很匆忙，我……我摔倒了……”

I nearly snort with laughter, now I can see the scene. Kaworu in a hurry to put on his trousers must have slipped and fallen. What a sight that must have been. All I can do is nod as I watch him put his trousers on, shame. He then hurriedly picks up his shirt and slips that on. I can't help but wonder why he is in such a rush, does he have to be somewhere? Is it to get away from me?  
我差点笑出声来，现在我能想象那个场景了。渚薰急着穿裤子，一定是滑倒了。那场面一定很滑稽。我只能点头，看着他穿上裤子，显得有些尴尬。然后他急忙拿起衬衫穿上。我不禁好奇他为什么这么匆忙，他要去哪里吗？是为了避开我吗？

I wonder if maybe last night was too much for him, he's not used to being around people and at a concert there are so many people then I took him to that bar afterwards. Was that too much for him? Or has he realized he should be afraid of me and wants to get away. I step forward, "Whats wrong? How come you're leaving so quickly?"  
我在想，昨晚对他来说是不是太过分了，他不习惯在人群中，而演唱会上人那么多，之后我还带他去了那家酒吧。这对他来说是不是太多了？还是他已经意识到应该害怕我，想要逃离。我向前一步，问道：“怎么了？为什么这么快就要走？”

"M-My alarm… it didn't… I have to go to work… I… I'm late and…"  
“我的闹钟…它没响…我得去上班…我…我迟到了…”

"Um Kaworu…" I step further into the room and shake my head, I guess he is a little bit confused.  
“嗯，薰…”我走进房间，摇了摇头，我想他有点困惑。

He doesn't reply as he finishes buttoning up his shirt. He looked around for what I presume is his tie or a jacket. He didn't have either object last night. He looks horrified, "Oh no… I-I haven't got them!"  
他没有回答，只是继续扣好衬衫的扣子。他环顾四周，我想他是在找领带或夹克。昨晚他并没有这两样东西。他看起来惊慌失措，“哦不……我、我没有带它们！”

"Kaworu…"I repeat myself as I walk further into the room. I lean my elbows casually on the back of the sofa and he once again ignores me as he picks up his wallet and phone and stuffs the items into his pockets.  
“渚薰……”我再次喊道，同时走进房间。我随意地将手肘靠在沙发背上，而他又一次无视了我，拿起钱包和手机，将它们塞进口袋。

"Kaworu!" I repeat a third time but this time raise my voice slightly, he stops dead in his tracks and turns to look at me.  
“渚薰！”我第三次喊道，这次稍微提高了声音，他突然停下脚步，转过身来看着我。

"A-Asuka I… I have to go, I… work…"  
"A-明日香，我…我得走了，我…要工作…"

"It's Saturday…" I say to him and I watch as the panic fades from his face only to be replaced once more by a look of embarrassment.  
"今天是星期六…" 我对他说，看着他脸上的恐慌逐渐消退，却又再次被尴尬的神情所取代。

"S-S-Saturday… Are you sure?"  
"星…星期六…你确定吗？"

I nod my head, "Well considering yesterday was Friday and Saturday is traditionally the day that comes after Friday I'm at least 99 percent sure."  
我点点头，“嗯，考虑到昨天是星期五，而星期六传统上是紧随其后的日子，我至少有 99%的把握。”

"Oh… I didn't… I forgot… the… being here and last night I…" He shakes his head and his cheeks are once again glowing a bright shade of red, "I… I am sorry. I did not wake you did I?"  
“哦……我没想到……我忘了……在这里和昨晚我……”他摇摇头，脸颊再次泛起鲜艳的红色，“我……我很抱歉。我没有吵醒你吧？”

I shake my head, "Don't worry about it, I was already awake. Sit down, I'll make you some coffee."  
我摇摇头，“别担心，我已经醒了。坐下吧，我给你弄点咖啡。”

He relaxes his shoulders and sits himself down on the sofa. I shoot him a grin as he awkwardly smiles back at me, "Thank you."  
他放松了肩膀，坐到沙发上。我朝他咧嘴一笑，他尴尬地回以微笑，"谢谢你。"

"How do you take it?" I ask.  
"你怎么喝？" 我问道。

"Some milk, and sugar." "加点牛奶和糖。"

I move into the kitchen area and start preparing some coffee for the two of us. I look over to him as he sits on my sofa looking around in an awkward fashion. Finally he speaks, "I… I must thank you once again for last night. The concert was simply wonderful and mesmerizing, humanity is… really capable of wondrous things."  
我走进厨房区，开始为我们俩准备咖啡。我瞥向他，他正坐在我的沙发上，尴尬地环顾四周。终于，他开口了，“我……我必须再次感谢你昨晚的款待。那场音乐会真是美妙绝伦，令人着迷，人类……确实能创造出奇迹般的事物。”

"I'm just glad you enjoyed it." I reply as I finish making our coffee. I bring them over to the sofa and place them down on the coffee table. I move a few things around on the table to try to make space. I try to avoid his gaze as I do so feeling somewhat embarrassed by the state of my front room. I can only imagine what Kaworu must think of this place considering the condition his own apartment is in.  
“我只是很高兴你喜欢。”我回答着，同时完成了咖啡的制作。我把它们端到沙发旁，放在咖啡桌上。我挪动了几样东西，试图腾出空间。我尽量避开他的目光，因为我的客厅状况让我感到有些尴尬。我只能想象，考虑到他自己的公寓状况，Kaworu 会怎么看待这个地方。

I try to keep the subject on the concert hoping that maybe he won't notice the used plate or empty cups I'm moving around, "I just figured it would be something you'd enjoy and I had the spare ticket."  
我试图将话题保持在音乐会上，希望他不会注意到我挪动的那些用过的盘子或空杯子，“我只是觉得你会喜欢，而且我有多余的票。”

"I enjoyed it very much, thank you for letting me use that spare ticket. I was not aware there were people performing the music in such a fashion."  
"我非常喜欢，谢谢你让我用那张多余的票。我之前不知道有人会以这种方式演奏音乐。"

"No problem. If I hear of anything else I'll let you know about it."  
"没事的。如果我听到其他什么消息，我会告诉你的。"

"That would be most kind of you. I… I still have a lot to learn about finding my way in this world it seems. Fuyutsuki has… helped me in some ways but I feel there is so much more that I cannot learn from him. He is… nice but he is quite a serious man. I do not feel I could ask him about things such as concerts, television or video games."  
"那真是太好了。我……我似乎还有很多关于在这个世界中找到方向的东西要学。冬月先生……在某些方面帮助了我，但我觉得还有很多东西是我无法从他那里学到的。他……人很好，但他是个相当严肃的人。我觉得我不能向他询问关于音乐会、电视或电子游戏之类的事情。"

I shrug, "Probably not. I… I try to have minimal contact with him to be honest. I'd rather not…"  
我耸耸肩，“大概不会。我……说实话，我尽量减少和他的接触。我宁愿不……”

I trail off before finally adding, "I just have my own stuff to worry about and his help isn't something I really need nor want."  
我话没说完，最后补充道，“我只是有自己的事情要操心，他的帮助既不是我真正需要的，也不是我想要的。”

Kaworu nods and picks up his cup cradling it in his hands for a few moments, "I see. I forgot to ask but what exactly is it that you do?"  
渚薰点点头，拿起杯子在手中捧了一会儿，“我明白了。我忘了问，但你具体是做什么的？”

I pause for a moment and wonder what I should say to him. I can't exactly turn around and say I do nothing at all. I don't want people to think I live off of the payout the UN gave me but I also like my anonymity. Very few people know the truth of what it is I do. I look back up at Kaworu, I can't imagine he'd tell anyone. It's not like he knows anyone aside from Fuyutsuki and I can already guarantee Fuyutsuki knows because of his network of security following me.  
我停顿了一下，思索着该对他说些什么。我总不能转身告诉他我无所事事。我不希望人们认为我靠联合国给我的补偿金生活，但我又喜欢保持匿名。很少有人知道我真正的工作是什么。我再次抬头看向薰，我无法想象他会告诉任何人。他除了冬月之外并不认识其他人，而我可以肯定冬月已经知道了，因为他的安全网络一直在跟踪我。

I get to my feet and go to one of the bookcases and pull one of the promotional copies of the first book from the shelf. I hand it to Kaworu, "I write."  
我站起身，走到一个书架前，从上面抽出一本第一本书的宣传样书。我递给薰，“我写作。”

"You write? That is wonderful! I had no idea!" His eyes grow wide with wonder as he takes the book from me. He studies the cover for a few moments because looking back up at me in confusion, "Mari… Makinami? But that… is not your name…"  
“你写作？太棒了！我完全不知道！”他接过书，眼中闪烁着惊奇的光芒。他仔细研究了一会儿封面，然后困惑地抬头看我，“真希波…玛金纳？但这…不是你的名字…”

"It's a pseudonym…" I reply flatly, "I don't use my real name."  
"这是个笔名……" 我平淡地回答，"我不使用真名。"

"Oh!" he looks at the book again before nodding, "I… I see… I understand."  
"哦！" 他再次看向书，然后点头，"我……我明白了……我懂了。"

I wonder for a brief moment if he really does understand but then he looks up at me and gives me a knowing smile and another nod. Of course he understands, he understands why I write under a pseudonym and why I don't want me name to be known. I don't need to tell Kaworu any of that because he'd be the same. We don't want people to recognize us because of the people we were or think we were.  
我短暂地怀疑他是否真的理解，但随后他抬头看向我，给了我一个会心的微笑和另一个点头。当然他理解，他理解我为何用笔名写作，为何不想让我的名字为人所知。我不需要向渚解释这些，因为他也会是同样的想法。我们不希望人们因为过去的我们或他们认为的我们而认出我们。

He turns the book over in his hand and starts to read the back of it. I now have to wonder if he'll make the connection, I can still remember quite clearly the look on her face when she did. I tried to hide those feelings of pride I felt when I saw it happen but I couldn't help it. I made Rei Ayanami cry tears of happiness, that was such an achievement and to make her happy like that is the least I could do to make up for what I put her and her brother through.  
他翻转手中的书，开始阅读背面。我现在不得不猜测他是否会联想到，我仍清晰记得她当时脸上的表情。我试图隐藏当我看到那一幕时感到的骄傲，但我无法抑制。我让绫波零流下了幸福的泪水，那是一项如此了不起的成就，让她那样快乐是我至少能做的，以弥补我给她和她哥哥带来的痛苦。

"Zero… A young girl brought up in isolation and unsure of her humanity. She is sent out to fight a great evil that threatens her race… Is this…"  
“零……一个在隔离中长大的年轻女孩，对自己的身份感到不确定。她被派去对抗威胁她种族的巨大邪恶……这是……”

I take the book from him and nod, "Yeah… It is… It's Rei."  
我从他手中接过书，点头道，“是的……就是她……是绫波。”

"D-Do you… have contact with her?" he averts his eyes as I silently nod my head.  
"你……和她有联系吗？" 他避开目光，我默默地点头。

"Yes I do, she was the one who told me who you were actually. She saw your name on that form and filled me in on the details."  
"是的，我有联系。是她告诉我你的真实身份的。她看到表格上有你的名字，就把详情告诉了我。"

Kaworu leaps to his feet, "Rei is here?"  
Kaworu 猛地站起身，"Rei 在这里吗？"

I hold out my hand to calm him, "Relax, she went back to Japan yesterday."  
我伸出手安抚他，“放松，她昨天回日本了。”

"Oh…"

He sits back down and relaxes somewhat. I wonder if I should tell him that it was Rei's ticket he used yesterday to go to the concert. I should probably tell him he has nothing to be afraid of when it comes to Rei but then I remember how she reacted to news that he was alive and wonder if that is true. Maybe he should be afraid of her.  
他坐回原位，稍微放松了一些。我在想是否应该告诉他，昨天他用的是丽的那张票去看演唱会。或许我该告诉他，在丽面前他无需害怕，但随即我想起她得知他还活着时的反应，又怀疑这话是否属实。也许他真的应该对丽有所提防。

"Rei is… actually one of the few friends I have… Probably the only friend actually. She is one of the few who knows who I am… where I am…" I let out a laugh, "Not that I made it easy for her of course."  
丽是……其实是我为数不多的朋友之一……大概也是唯一的朋友。她是少数几个知道我是谁……我在哪里的人……" 我笑出声来，"当然，我并没有让她轻易了解我。

I can still remember the moment Rei turned up on my doorstep as if it was yesterday. At that point in time I had only just started writing and I had settled on using Rei as a template for the main character. Why did I pick her at a template? Guilt I suppose, I felt a lot of guilt for everything I did back then and I still do feel it but Rei... she got the brunt of it. She was the verbal punching bag, I called her names and called her out in front of others.  
我至今仍记得丽出现在我家门口的那一刻，仿佛就在昨天。那时我才刚开始写作，决定以丽为原型塑造主角。为什么选择她作为模板？我想是出于愧疚吧，我对自己当时所做的一切感到非常内疚，至今仍有这种感觉，但丽……她承受了最多的痛苦。她是我的出气筒，我给她起绰号，在别人面前指责她。

I had no idea of course what she was and what she had been through. The worst thing is with how I was back then I don't think I'd have cared. I wanted to somehow make it up to her. Naturally I couldn't just pick up the phone and apologize, I had to make a grand gesture even if she didn't know about it. So I used her as a basis for the main character in my story.  
当然，我当时并不知道她的经历和她的真实身份。最糟糕的是，以我那时的状态，我想我也不会在乎。我想要以某种方式弥补她。自然，我不能只是打个电话道歉，我必须做出一个重大的举动，即使她并不知情。于是，我以她为原型创作了故事中的主角。

At the time I started this I had been living on my own for a year and a half. They had initially tried to put me back together with my father and his wife. For a moment I was tempted to go back. To try to have a normal family life and pretend nothing had happened but some of that old stubbornness and need for independence was still within me. I insisted that I be placed on my own and that I'd be more than capable of looking after myself.  
那时我开始这段生活时，已经独自生活了一年半。他们最初试图让我回到父亲和他的妻子身边。有那么一刻，我确实动摇了，想要尝试过正常的家庭生活，假装什么都没发生过。但内心深处那份固执和独立的需求依旧存在。我坚持要自己独立生活，并坚信自己完全有能力照顾好自己。

Besides I don't fit in with that group anymore, I never have done. I rebelled against the two of them from the moment my mother died through to leaving for Japan. I never gave them a chance to help me or be my family. I blamed my dad for my mother's death and whilst I got on with my stepmother I never really wanted her around. They have their own life, their own children now and whilst I do see them occasionally I try to keep my distance.  
况且，我再也融入不了那个圈子了，我从未真正融入过。从母亲去世到前往日本，我一直都在反抗他们俩。我从未给他们机会来帮助我或成为我的家人。我责怪父亲导致了母亲的离世，虽然与继母相处尚可，但我从未真正希望她在我身边。他们有自己的生活，现在也有了自己的孩子，尽管我偶尔会去看望他们，但总是尽量保持距离。

At that time my father and Fuyutsuki were still trying to maintain regular contact. When I heard the knock on my door I did think it'd be either of them. You can imagine both my surprise and horror when I saw that it was in fact Rei Ayanami. It turns out that she had been talking to Fuyutsuki about wanting to find me for some time. He had not told her where I was but she was smart. She knew that I'd have gone back to Germany and travelled there on her own.  
那时我父亲和冬月还在努力保持定期联系。听到敲门声时，我确实以为会是他们中的任何一个。你可以想象当我发现实际上是绫波零时，我的惊讶和恐惧。原来她已经和冬月谈过好一阵子，想找到我。冬月没有告诉她我在哪里，但她很聪明。她知道我会回到德国，于是独自一人去了那里。

From there she had found my parents and they had told her where I was. I wasn't angry at them, I understood why they did that. This person had just travelled thousands of miles to see me, they couldn't exactly turn them away.  
在那里，她找到了我的父母，他们告诉了她我的下落。我并不生他们的气，我理解他们为什么这么做。这个人刚刚跨越千里来见我，他们无法拒绝她。

My first thought was that Rei was here to yell at me or give me what it was I deserved for being such a horrible person to her and everyone else. Instead she looked at me across the doorstep for a few moments before saying my name and throwing herself at me. She bawled about how much it was she missed me. It was the first of many hugs I would receive from Rei.  
我首先想到的是，绫波来这里是为了对我大吼大叫，或者给我应得的惩罚，因为我对她和所有人都很糟糕。然而，她站在门口看了我一会儿，然后叫了我的名字，扑向我。她哭着说她有多么想念我。这是我从绫波那里得到的第一个拥抱。

She told me about how she had travelled all this way on her own under the guise of taking a holiday. She wanted as few people to know she was looking for me as possible. That suited me just fine, I wanted as few people to know where I was as possible. I made her promise to me that she wouldn't tell anyone she had been in contact with me. I told her why I left Japan and why I had to stay away, I don't know if she approved of my reasons or fully understood them but she has respected them and that is good enough for me. Both myself and Rei have been good friends ever since.  
她向我讲述了她是如何独自一人假借度假的名义来到这里的。她希望尽可能少的人知道她在找我。这正合我意，我也希望尽可能少的人知道我的行踪。我让她向我保证，不会告诉任何人她曾与我联系过。我告诉她我离开日本的原因以及为何必须远离，我不知道她是否赞同我的理由或完全理解，但她尊重我的选择，这对我来说已经足够了。从那以后，我和丽一直是好朋友。

Me and Kaworu sit drinking our coffee and another hour passes as we sit and talk about the concert last night and Kaworu tells me some of his experience in the emergence facility. Not long after that he excuses himself to go back home. We exchange phone numbers and e-mail addresses and make that promise to stay in contact with each other. I give him a copy of my book, signed of course, and he asks eagerly when the second one will be released.  
我和渚薰坐着喝咖啡，又过了一个小时，我们聊起了昨晚的音乐会，渚薰还向我讲述了一些他在出现设施的经历。不久后，他告辞回家。我们交换了电话号码和电子邮件地址，并承诺保持联系。我给了他一本我的书，当然签了名，他还急切地询问第二本何时出版。

As I watch him leave I take my phone out of the pocket and see I've received a message from Rei. It's an apology that she didn't get in touch sooner but she is now back in Japan and is alright. She tells me that she ended up going out with Misato and her brother for dinner and she was too tired to do anything when she returned. She warns me to be careful and reminds me once again about how dangerous Kaworu is.  
看着他离去，我从口袋里掏出手机，发现收到了丽的一条消息。她为没有及时联系而道歉，但现在她已经回到日本，一切安好。她告诉我，她和美里还有她哥哥一起吃了晚饭，回来时太累了，什么也做不了。她提醒我要小心，并再次强调了渚的危险性。

I read that last sentence over again and feel a pang in my stomach. Kaworu slips out of view and I stand in my doorway for a few moments thinking over the strange situation. That person that Rei thinks Kaworu is... is not the person I met last night and went out to a concert with. Kaworu is just like me... He's just like all of us, he's afraid and trying to figure things out. I understand Rei's concerns and worries and I wonder just how I'm going to explain to her that I didn't just not follow her advice but I spent the night at a concert with him and let him crash on my sofa.  
我又读了一遍最后那句话，心里一阵刺痛。渚的身影消失在视线中，我在门口站了一会儿，思索着这奇怪的情况。丽认为的渚的那个人……并不是我昨晚遇见并一起去音乐会的那个人。渚和我一样……他和我们所有人一样，他害怕，也在努力弄清楚一切。我理解丽的担忧和忧虑，我好奇自己该如何向她解释，我没有听从她的建议，反而和他一起去了音乐会，还让他睡在了我的沙发上。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo 2 – Afternoon 东京 2 号——午后**

I feel exhausted as I navigate the shopping bags set down around me in an attempt to place my tray on the table. I slide the chair out and sit down, grateful for the opportunity to take the weight off of my feet. Around me others are doing the same, Touji and Hikari taking up a position opposite me, Kensuke takes the seat to my left and Rei the one to my right.  
我感到筋疲力尽，试图在周围堆满购物袋的桌子上放下我的托盘。我拉出椅子坐下，感激有机会让双脚休息一下。周围其他人也在做同样的事情，东治和光坐在我对面，真希则坐在我的左边，丽坐在我的右边。

Myself, Hikari and Kensuke all seem to have gotten the same thing. Rei has opted for a salad, one of the few vegetarian options in this fast food place. Touji, as expected has gone for one of the 'deluxe' burger options and as I glance as his tray I wonder how a human is even supposed to fit that in their mouth. Yet I know that somehow Touji will manage it.  
我和光、真希似乎都点了同样的东西。丽选择了沙拉，这是这家快餐店为数不多的素食选项之一。东治，不出所料，点了一个“豪华”汉堡，当我瞥向他的托盘时，我好奇人类怎么可能把那东西塞进嘴里。然而我知道，东治总有办法搞定。

Rei, sensing my exhaustion turns to me and smiles warmly, "Are you feeling okay Shinji?"  
丽察觉到我的疲惫，转向我，温暖地微笑着，“你还好吗，真嗣？”

I give her a nod and smile back, "I'm alright Rei, just tired. We've covered a lot of ground today."  
我向她点头微笑，“我没事，丽，只是有点累。今天我们走了不少路。”

I look at the amount of shopping bags we all have between us and that seems to be a bit of an understatement. It's been a long time since we've all been out together like this. It means we all had a bit of extra money to spend too.  
我看着我们所有人手中的购物袋，这似乎有点轻描淡写了。我们很久没有像这样一起出来了。这意味着我们都有点额外的钱可以花。

"Good, I would not wish for you to be uncomfortable."  
“很好，我不希望你感到不适。”

My smile grows wider, "I know Rei, don't worry about me though. I'm... I'm fine when I'm with all of you."  
我的笑容更灿烂了，“我知道丽，不过别担心我。我……和你们在一起时，我感觉很好。”

There is a brief moment of silence as people get comfortable and begin to eat their food. Touji greedily picks up his burger. It's huge and I dread to think what is inside it. He takes a bit from it and makes a satisfied noise after doing so. Hikari shoots him a disapproving look as she politely bites into her food.  
大家安静了一会儿，各自调整好姿势开始用餐。冬二贪婪地拿起他的汉堡。那汉堡巨大无比，我都不敢想里面塞了些什么。他咬了一口，满意地哼了一声。光子瞪了他一眼，自己则优雅地小口吃着食物。

Contrary to Rei's concernts I have had a good day. I always do when I'm with them all. It's one of the few times I never feel afraid. I never have to worry about anything when I'm around them. I can just be myself and enjoy it all. They're all my friends and being with them somehow manages to alleviate all my fears and concerns.  
与丽所担忧的相反，我今天过得很愉快。和他们在一起时我总是如此。这是我难得不感到害怕的时刻之一。在他们身边，我无需担心任何事。我可以做回自己，尽情享受这一切。他们都是我的朋友，和他们在一起似乎能驱散我所有的恐惧和忧虑。

Yet as I look at the empty sixth seat at our table I am hit with something of a bittersweet feeling. I feel like I shouldn't be bothered by it now, it's been years but she was a part of this group and in a way, she still is. I feel like she should be here shopping and laughing with us. Calling us idiots and marching us from place to place.  
然而，当我看着我们桌子上空着的第六个座位时，一种苦乐参半的感觉涌上心头。我觉得现在不应该为此烦恼，已经过去多年了，但她曾是这个团队的一部分，某种程度上，她依然是的。我感觉她应该在这里和我们一起购物、欢笑，称呼我们为傻瓜，带着我们从一个地方走到另一个地方。

I shake my head and try to focus on my food. I do still wonder about her from time to time. It was upsetting when she left and I naturally blamed myself, I still do blame myself. I miss her a lot but at the same time I think I understood why she left. I know she wasn't happy here in Japan and I just hope wherever she is now that she is happy. She deserves that.  
我摇摇头，试图专注于我的食物。我偶尔还是会想起她。她离开时我很伤心，自然地责怪自己，至今仍自责。我很想念她，但同时我也理解她离开的原因。我知道她在这里不快乐，我只希望无论她现在身在何处，她都能快乐。她值得拥有那份幸福。

"How was America Rei?" I hear Hikari ask.  
“美国怎么样，丽？”我听到光问。

"America was good, I was unfortunately unable to view everything I wished to whilst I was there so I will have to visit again in the future." Rei tells her, "I was however quite fortunate to be able to witness a live dinosaur bone excavation."  
"美国很不错，可惜我在那里时没能看到所有我想看的，所以将来还得再去一次。" 丽告诉她，"不过我很幸运能亲眼目睹一次活生生的恐龙化石挖掘。"

"A dinosaur excavation! That must have been amazing!" Kensuke exclaims loudly, "What sort was it? Was it a T-Rex? Was it something huge with big teeth?"  
"恐龙挖掘！那一定很惊人！" 健介大声惊叹，"是什么种类的？是霸王龙吗？还是那种有着大牙齿的巨型恐龙？"

"It was a Triceratops." Rei replies cooly.  
"是三角龙。" 丽冷静地回答道。"

"You know…" Touji speaks with his mouth half full of his food, an action that earns him a stern glare from Hikari, "I find it hard to believe that creatures like that roamed around once. I mean can you imagine something that big just walking around?"  
"你知道吗…" 真嗣嘴里塞满了食物说道，这一举动让他赢得了光严厉的一瞥，"我很难相信那种生物曾经在周围游荡。我是说，你能想象那么大的东西就在周围走动吗？"

One by one each of us raise our head and stare at Touji in mild disbelief. He sees us all staring and shrugs, "What?"  
我们一个接一个地抬起头，带着些许难以置信的目光盯着真嗣。他看到我们都在盯着他，耸了耸肩，"怎么了？"

Hikari shakes her head, "You can be so dense sometimes Touji!"  
光摇了摇头，"你有时候真是迟钝得可以，真嗣！"

"What… What did I say?" Touji asks.  
"我…我说了什么？" 东治问道。

"The Angels Touji…" "使徒，东治…"

"Oh!" He finally realizes, "Yeah but they were different like… the dinosaurs were really big right?"  
"哦！" 他终于明白了，"对，但它们不一样，就像…恐龙真的很大，对吧？"

"The dinosaurs weren't bigger than the Angels of the Eva's Touji!" Kensuke informs him, "The Eva's must have been like a hundred metres tall! No Dinosaur was that big…"  
"恐龙可没有 EVA 的东治天使那么大！" 健介告诉他，"EVA 肯定有一百米高！没有哪种恐龙有那么大……"

Kensuke trails off when he sees the glare that Hikari is now shooting him. He turns around to me and Rei and shrugs, "Sorry guys… I guess… not really a suitable subject is it?"  
健介看到光希现在瞪他的眼神，声音渐渐小了下去。他转向我和丽，耸了耸肩，"抱歉，伙计们……我猜……这话题不太合适，是吧？"

"I don't mind but… Rei?"  
"我不介意，不过……丽？"

I look towards me sister, "Aida is quite correct, the Eva's were much taller than any known dinosaur. The Angels however did vary in size, some of the dinosaurs may in fact have been larger than them in fact I can think of at least two."  
"我转向我的妹妹，“Aida 说得没错，Eva 们比任何已知的恐龙都要高大。不过使徒的体型确实各异，有些恐龙实际上可能比它们还要大，至少我能想到两种。””

"Well what about Godzilla! That was a dinosaur right and that was pretty big."  
““那哥斯拉呢！那也是恐龙吧，而且相当巨大。””

Hikari groans as Kensuke gestures wildly in his reply, "Godzilla was fictional Touji! Besides Godzilla varied in size depending on the film. Film companies could never keep it consistent, sometimes it was 50 metres and in the new one it was 150 metres!"  
"光子叹了口气，看着真希挥舞着手臂反驳道，“哥斯拉是虚构的，阿斯兰！而且哥斯拉的体型因电影而异。制片公司从未能保持一致，有时它有 50 米高，而在新片中则达到了 150 米！””

"So it could have been the same size as an Eva!" Touji replies, "So could it have taken on an Eva? Imagine that, Godzilla vs an Evangelion!"  
"这么说，它可能和 Eva 一样大！" 冬二回答，"那它能不能变成 Eva 的样子呢？想象一下，哥斯拉对战福音战士！"

"An Eva would crush Godzilla Touji! I mean did you see the Eva's?"  
"Eva 会把哥斯拉碾压的，冬二！我是说，你看过 Eva 吗？"

"Guys!" Hikari tries to interject.  
"伙计们！" 光试图插话。

I laugh it off, "I don't mind, besides can't really stop them can we?"  
我笑着摆手，“我不介意，再说也阻止不了他们，不是吗？”

It's such an absurd conversation I can't help but laugh at it. Besides I don't mind them talking about the Eva as much anymore, I still associate a lot of painful memories with it but I can't hide from it. On the other hand I do wonder if I should stop it, Rei looks quite angry as she glares between the two of them.  
这场对话太荒谬了，我不禁笑出声来。虽然现在我对他们谈论 Eva 不再那么介意，但与之相关的许多痛苦记忆依旧萦绕心头，我无法逃避。另一方面，我也好奇是否该制止他们，丽看着他们，眼神中明显带着怒意。

"Yeah but Godzilla has near impenetrable armour AND is has the nuclear breath! I bet it could do some damage to the Eva's."  
“是啊，但哥斯拉有近乎坚不可摧的装甲，还有核能吐息！我敢打赌它能对 Eva 造成不小的伤害。”

"Suzahara, stop this!" Rei speaks quietly but firmly. I should have asked them to stop, clearly Rei is uncomfortable with what is happening. I start to hand my head but then she speaks again and my jaw nearly drops, "You are mistaken, such a creature would not pose any sort of challenge for any one of the Eva's. It lacks the A.T. Field and the array of weaponry that each of us possessed, therefore we would eventually prevail."  
“铃原，停下来！”丽平静但坚定地说道。我本该让他们停止的，显然丽对正在发生的事情感到不适。我正要低头，但她又开口了，我差点惊掉了下巴：“你误会了，这样的生物对任何一位 EVA 驾驶员来说都不构成挑战。它没有 A.T.力场和我们的武器装备，因此我们最终会取胜。”

**3rd September 2021 2021 年 9 月 3 日**

**Asuka's Apartment – Afternoon  
明日香的家——下午**

Two weeks have now passed since I saw Kaworu Nagisa. We've kept in contact with one another since then, a few messages here and there but we haven't seen one another in person. I guess I feel… nervous about him and our friendship. After he left on that day my thoughts were occupied by him and him alone. It gave me a warm feeling but also one I'm afraid of.  
自从我见到渚薰已经过去两周了。自那以后我们一直保持着联系，偶尔发几条消息，但还没有面对面见过。我想我对他和我们的友谊感到……紧张。那天他离开后，我的思绪全被他占据，这让我感到温暖，但也让我害怕。

It was nice to sit alongside him at that concert, to know he was smiling because of me and for us to cheer as we watched that band play some of our favourite music. I even think about how cute he looked on that Saturday morning. It was nice to just, for a short period of time, not be plagued by the constant guilt and worry that I always feel.  
在音乐会上与他并肩而坐很愉快，知道他因为我而微笑，我们一起为乐队演奏我们最喜欢的音乐而欢呼。我甚至还记得那个周六早上他看起来多么可爱。那段时间，我暂时摆脱了总是困扰我的内疚和担忧，感觉真好。

It was just for that one day though, the very next day the nightmares returned and along with it all the doubt and worry. That realization returned that I was a bad person and I don't deserve to be happy. It was such a crash from the highs I felt the previous day. I even managed to feel disgusted with myself for enjoying the sight of his mostly naked body.  
但那只是一天而已，第二天噩梦就回来了，随之而来的还有所有的怀疑和担忧。我意识到自己是个坏人，不配拥有幸福。从前一天的高涨情绪中跌落的感觉太糟糕了。我甚至因为享受他近乎赤裸的身体而感到自我厌恶。

I, Asuka Langley Soryu, do not deserve to be happy nor do I deserve to have anyone nearby who makes or tries to make me happy. I know exactly what will happen because I know who I really am. I know what I'll do if they get close, I'll just end up hurting them. Like I've hurt so many others in my life. I was tempted to do it to Kaworu, to angrily message him and tell him to never come near me again.  
我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，不配拥有幸福，也不配身边有任何人试图让我快乐。我清楚会发生什么，因为我了解真正的自己。我知道如果他们靠近，我只会伤害他们。就像我一生中伤害过那么多人一样。我曾想对渚薰那样做，愤怒地给他发消息，告诉他永远不要靠近我。

I didn't do that though, I couldn't do that because I want to see him again, I need to see him again. A stronger part of me is pushing to keep up this friendship because maybe, just maybe I do deserve to be happy.  
但我没有那么做，我做不到，因为我想要再见他，我需要再见他。我内心更强大的一部分在推动我维持这段友谊，因为也许，只是也许，我确实值得幸福。

Of course adding to my guilt is the fact that I couldn't bring myself to tell Rei about my encounter with Kaworu. She should know, she is and has been my only friend over the last couple of years but I don't know what I should say to her. What can I say? I heard what she said about Kaworu, about how dangerous he is. I can't exactly turn around and tell her I went to visit him, took him to a concert and let him sleep on my couch.  
当然，让我更加内疚的是，我无法鼓起勇气告诉绫波关于我和渚薰的相遇。她应该知道，她是我过去几年里唯一的朋友，但我不知道该对她说什么。我能说什么呢？我听到了她对渚薰的评价，关于他有多危险。我总不能转身告诉她，我去找了他，带他去听了音乐会，还让他睡在我的沙发上。

The only saving grace is that I've been kept quite busy these past two weeks so not had as much time to become absorbed in my guilt. My publisher decided to send out the press releases and set a date for my second books release, without consulting me first. Fourth of December it'll come out, my Birthday. It's not really a date I enjoy being reminded of, nothing good has ever happened on my Birthday.  
唯一值得庆幸的是，过去两周我忙得不可开交，所以没有太多时间沉浸在自责中。我的出版商未经我同意就决定发布新闻稿，并定下了我的第二本书的发行日期。12 月 4 日，那一天也是我的生日。这个日期我并不喜欢被提醒，因为我的生日从未发生过什么好事。

I push that thought aside, last year was pretty good. I got a nice e-mail from Rei and she sent me a package with a cuddly toy rabbit. I bought myself a cake, it was nice.  
我抛开这个念头，去年其实还不错。我收到了丽发来的温馨邮件，她还寄给我一个毛绒玩具兔子。我自己买了一个蛋糕，感觉很好。

The publisher's decision meant I've had to do a bit of extra work on the book as I want it to be ready in plenty of time. I finished up the ending and went through the entire thing altering and correcting the sections I wasn't happy with. It didn't take me too long to do, if I've retained anything good from my past-self it's that I tend to be quite good at what I set my mind to and I make minimal mistakes. So when it comes to the release of Mari Makinami's second book, things should go smoothly.  
出版商的决定意味着我需要为这本书多做一些工作，以确保它有充足的时间准备就绪。我完成了结尾部分，并通读全文，修改和校正了我不满意的部分。这并没有花我太多时间，如果我从过去的自己那里保留了什么优点，那就是我通常对自己设定的目标相当擅长，并且犯的错误极少。因此，当真希波·真理奈的第二本书发行时，一切应该会顺利进行。

I now find myself bored and wondering what I should do tonight. I've been irritating myself throughout the day with the idea of messaging Kaworu and asking if he would like to do something. Yet I know I should probably stay far away from him. Sending texts or e-mailing is fine, there is no contact or risk there but seeing each other in person. I just know if we continue to be friends he'll eventually realize who I am and leave.  
我现在感到无聊，不知道今晚该做些什么。一整天，我都在纠结是否该给渚发消息，问他是否想做点什么。然而我知道，我或许应该离他远些。发短信或邮件倒无妨，没有接触也没有风险，但面对面相见就不同了。我心里清楚，如果我们继续做朋友，他迟早会认出我是谁，然后离开。

Yet I really want to see him again. I'm at a loss on what to do and even what to say. I have my phone in my hands, our conversation open and ready for me to type something. It's not like I've invited anyone out before. The concert was a spur of the moment thing because I felt bad for him. If I ask him out again then how will that look? What will he say? Will it be a... one of those d-words?  
但我真的很想再见他一面。我不知道该怎么做，甚至该说什么。手机就在我手中，对话框已经打开，等待我输入些什么。我以前从未邀请过任何人出去。那次音乐会是因为我觉得他可怜，一时冲动之举。如果我再次约他出去，那会是什么样子？他会说什么？会不会是那种...那种带有'约会'意味的事情？

I've been on a grand total of one of those in my life. I ended up leaving the guy in the queue for a rollercoaster because he bored me. After that I went home and made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have very little faith in myself as to how things would go on another date.  
我这辈子总共就经历过一次那种事。结果在排队等过山车时，我因为觉得那人无聊而离开了。之后我回家，犯下了我人生中最大的错误之一。对于再次约会的结果，我对自己几乎没有什么信心。

Still, I'm certain he would be interested. We have have been messaging each other a lot. He even asked me for advice on buying a games console. I was happy to advise him on which one to get and a number of games.  
尽管如此，我确信他会感兴趣。我们一直频繁地互发消息。他甚至还向我咨询购买游戏机的建议。我很乐意指导他选择哪款游戏机以及推荐一些游戏。

He's been informing me of his progress since then. It's been quite funny, even cute to see him go from not understanding anything to learning the games and enjoying them. He's been sending me screenshots of progress in levels or whenever he's won a match on a football game. Maybe that's what I could do, invite him over to play games together.  
自那以后，他一直在向我汇报他的进展。看到他从一无所知到逐渐学会并享受游戏的过程，既有趣又可爱。他经常发给我他在游戏关卡中的进度截图，或者在足球游戏中赢得比赛时的截图。也许我可以邀请他来一起玩游戏。

I let out a sigh and go back to the home screen of my phone. Why is this so difficult? I'm Asuka Langley Soryu damnit, I'm not supposed to have difficulty doing things. I'm a published author, I was an accomplished pilot and I got a damn college degree before I was fourteen. I shouldn't be having difficulty contacting someone because I want to hand out with them.  
我叹了口气，回到手机的主屏幕。为什么这件事这么难？我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，天哪，我不应该有做不成的事。我是个出版过作品的作家，曾是一名出色的飞行员，还在十四岁之前就拿到了大学学位。我不应该因为想和某人出去玩就难以联系他们。

I know why it's difficult though. It's difficult because I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. The petulant bratty girl who exists only to hurt others. Who should stay away from other people lest they see through me.  
我知道为什么这很难。难是因为我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。那个只会伤害别人的任性女孩。应该远离他人，以免他们看穿我。

I'm midway through my mental assault on myself when I suddenly see my phone start to ring. My heart leaps into my mouth thinking it could be him but I feel only disappointment when I don't recognize the caller ID. I'm prepared to ignore it but realize with the book stuff it might be important. On answering I'm greeted by a voice I haven't heard in years.  
我正自我攻击到一半时，突然看到手机开始响了。我心跳加速，以为可能是他，但看到不认识的来电显示时只有失望。我准备忽略它，但想到书的事情可能很重要。接通后，我听到了一个多年未闻的声音。

"Hello, is that Asuka?" “你好，是明日香吗？”

I almost hang up on him, the only reason I don't is because I can detect the hint of panic in his voice. Knowing his relationship with Kaworu he's earned at least a minute of my time.  
我差点挂了他的电话，没这么做的原因是我听出了他声音中的一丝慌乱。考虑到他和渚的关系，他至少赢得了我一分钟的时间。

"It is." I reply sharply, "Can I ask why you're calling, I thought I said I-"  
“是的。”我尖锐地回答，“我能问一下你为什么打电话来吗，我记得我说过我——”

"Yes, I know and normally I would not have contacted you but you are the only person I could contact, it's Nagisa he-"  
“是的，我知道，通常我不会联系你，但你是唯一我能联系的人，是渚他——”

My heart leaps into my mouth again although unlike last time it doesn't feel quite as good, "Kaworu? What happened?"  
我的心再次提到了嗓子眼，尽管与上次不同，这次并没有那么愉快，“渚薰？发生了什么？”

"There has been an incident. I know you and he have been in contact and I didn't know who else to contact. Do you think you could come over?"  
“发生了一件事。我知道你和他有联系，我不知道还能联系谁。你觉得你能过来吗？”

I don't hesitate in my reply, instead I leap up off of my sofa and hastily put my jacket on, "I'll be right there."-  
我毫不犹豫地回答，随即从沙发上跳起来，匆忙穿上外套，“我马上就到。”

**Kaworu's Apartment. 渚薰的公寓。**

My heart is beating rapidly in my chest as I turn the corner onto the street where Kaworu's apartment block is. I get to his building and lean against the wall for a moment to try to catch my breath. I regret having ran so much but I couldn't delay in getting here. I had to find out what had happened to Kaworu.  
我的心在胸腔里狂跳，当我拐过街角，来到渚薰公寓楼所在的那条街时。我到了他的楼前，靠在墙上喘口气。我后悔跑得太急，但我不能耽搁来这里的时间。我必须弄清楚渚薰发生了什么事。

I push the door to the lobby open and move through the corridor towards Kaworu's door. I knock a few times and barely any time passes between me knocking and the door opening. I ignore Fuyutsuki's greeting as I push past him and move into the front room. The curtains have been closed letting in only a small amount of light, a lamp is on next to the TV and I look around for him.  
我推开大厅的门，穿过走廊走向渚薰的房门。我敲了几下，几乎在我敲门的同时，门就开了。我无视了冬月老师的问候，推开他走进前厅。窗帘紧闭，只透进一丝光线，电视旁的一盏灯亮着，我四处寻找他。

Finally, I see him, lying on the sofa his eyes wide open in terror. He looks just as bad, if not worse than he did when I first met him. Only this time I can see the reason why. I try to not gasp at the sight of him. He's hurt and I don't even mean a little bit. Even at this distance I can make out the bruising around his eye, I can see his lip has been cut and there are little smudges of blood under his nose and on his cheeks.  
终于，我看到了他，躺在沙发上，眼睛因恐惧而睁得大大的。他的样子和初见时一样糟糕，甚至更甚。只是这次我能看出原因。我尽量不因他的样子而惊呼。他受了伤，远不止一点。即使隔着这段距离，我也能看到他眼周的淤青，他的嘴唇被割破，鼻下和脸颊上还有血迹。

I step further into the room and see that his shirt has been ripped and bloodied as well. The poor guy is an absolute mess. I quickly make my way over to his side and kneel down next him. I take his trembling hands in my own. As I look back up, I see Fuyutsuki has entered the room now.  
我进一步走进房间，发现他的衬衫也被撕破并沾满了血。这个可怜的家伙简直一团糟。我迅速走到他身边，跪在他旁边。我握住他颤抖的双手。当我再次抬头时，看到冬月已经进入了房间。

"What the hell happened to him?" My voice is shaking as I speak. I try to keep it steady, I try to keep myself from yelling. I can feel rage building inside of me but I need to keep it in check. Kaworu is terrified enough without seeing me explode.  
“他到底发生了什么？”我说话时声音在颤抖。我努力保持平稳，努力控制自己不要大喊。我能感觉到愤怒在内心积聚，但我需要克制住。看到我爆发只会让渚更加恐惧。

Fuyutsuki stands near to the sofa and merely shakes his head, "He was attacked."  
冬月站在沙发旁，只是摇了摇头，“他遭到了袭击。”

"Yes, I can see that." I snarl at him, "Who by? When? How?" I though the UN goons were watching us all the time, how did they let something like this happen?"  
“是的，我看得出来。”我朝他咆哮，“谁干的？什么时候？怎么发生的？”我以为联合国的人一直在监视我们，他们怎么会让这种事发生？”

Fuyutsuki says nothing for a few moments and merely bows his head. I can see the sorrow in his eyes but a part of me doesn't care. I'm not going to feel sorry for that damn old man, not when Kaworu is lying here shaking and hurt. I ask him again, "His security, what the hell were they doing?"  
冬月沉默了几秒，只是低下了头。我能从他的眼中看到悲伤，但一部分的我并不在乎。我不会为那个该死的老头感到难过，尤其是当渚薰躺在这里颤抖和受伤的时候。我再次质问他，“他的安保，他们到底在干什么？”

Again, I get no reply and it slowly starts to dawn on me what has happened. I open my mouth in shock as I look forwards Kaworu and once again at Fuyutsuki. I don't even need to be told but I ask anyway just for confirmation.  
又一次，我没有得到回复，慢慢地我开始明白发生了什么。我震惊地张开嘴，先看向渚薰，然后又看向冬月。我甚至不需要被告知，但我还是问了，只是为了确认。

"It was them... Wasn't it?"  
“是他们……对吧？”

Fuyutsuki nods, "Our security are checked and vetter, this shouldn't have happened."  
冬月点头，“我们的安保已经检查和审查过了，这本不该发生。”

"Well it did!" I snap back, "Where the hell are they?"  
"确实如此！" 我反驳道，"他们到底在哪儿？"

"Both of them have been relieved of their jobs and are with the appropriate authorities. I will be making sure they are dealt with as strongly as possible."  
"他们俩都已被解除职务，并交由相关部门处理。我会确保他们受到尽可能严厉的惩罚。"

"Not good enough." I get to my feet, "Where are they, I'll deal with them."  
"这还不够。" 我站起身，"他们在哪儿，我自己去处理。"

I start to move forward but I'm stopped when I feel Kaworu tugging at my hand. Fuyutsuki looks at me, "Miss Soryu, please..."  
我开始向前移动，但当我感觉到渚在拉我的手时停了下来。冬月看着我，“绫波小姐，请……”

"Those goons are supposed to be protecting us! They're supposed to be protecting him! You are supposed to be protecting him! You promised him that much! What sort of pathetic excuse for protection is this is they're the ones hurting him!"  
“那些家伙应该是保护我们的！他们应该是保护他的！你应该是保护他的！你答应过他这一点！这种保护算什么可悲的借口？他们反而在伤害他！”

I try to move forward again and break myself free of Kaworu's grip. I wonder if Fuyutsuki will try to stop me. I don't care, if I have to deal with him then I will but I won't let those bastards get away with this. I don't care what Kaworu is or what he was, he didn't deserve this to happen to him.  
我再次试图向前移动，挣脱渚的握持。我想知道冬月是否会试图阻止我。我不在乎，如果我必须面对他，那么我会这么做，但我不会让那些混蛋就这样逃脱。我不在乎渚是什么人或者他曾经是什么，他不应该遭受这样的对待。

"Soryu please." "Soryu，请。"

I stop still again and fix the former professor with an ice-cold stare, "What exactly is the purpose of the people who watch and follow us Fuyutsuki?"  
我再次停下脚步，用冰冷的目光盯着前教授，“那些观察并跟随我们的人，究竟有何目的，Fuyutsuki？”

He bows his head again, "I know..."  
他再次低下头，“我知道……”

"Their purpose is to make sure that people like me and Kaworu don't come to any harm. I didn't ask for their protection but I know they're there. I know he was promised it though, I know he was assured it and they have failed... You have failed! You-"  
"他们的职责是确保像我和渚这样的人不会受到伤害。我并没有要求他们的保护，但我知道他们就在那里。我知道他曾被承诺过保护，我知道他被保证过，但他们失败了……你们失败了！你——"

"A-Asuka... please..." "明日香... 请..."

I'm stopped mid rant by Kaworu's weakened voice. It pulls me out of my anger back to reality and I turn to see he is sitting up now.  
渚微弱的声音打断了我激烈的斥责。它将我从愤怒中拉回现实，我转身看到他现在正坐起身来。

"Please... I... I do not wish for you to fight nor for anyone else to be hurt. What happened to me... I... I deserve thi-"  
"请...我...我不希望你战斗，也不希望任何人受伤。发生在我身上的事...我...我应得的..."

"Shut up!" I snap back at him, "Don't you dare! Don't you dare tell me or dare to think that you deserve this. No one deserves this."  
"闭嘴！"我厉声回敬他，"你敢！你敢告诉我或敢想你应得这个。没有人应得这个。"

I shake my head one more time and slowly move back to Kaworu's side. I sit myself near to him and bring him down to rest his head on my lap. I gently run a hand through his hair and try to calm myself down. I can't let my anger get the better of me, if I storm out then what does Kaworu have? When I can though, if I can, then I'm going to make those bastards pay.  
我再次摇了摇头，慢慢退回到渚薰身边。我坐到他旁边，让他把头靠在我的膝上。我温柔地用手梳理他的头发，试图让自己平静下来。我不能让愤怒控制我，如果我冲出去，渚薰还有什么？只要有机会，如果我能做到，我会让那些混蛋付出代价。

"What happened Kaworu?" I try to soften my voice and he looks back up at me, his eyes wounded and tearful.  
"怎么了，卡沃鲁？" 我尽量让声音柔和些，他抬起头看向我，眼中带着伤痛和泪光。

"I was coming back from work... They approached me and they... attacked me in the lobby of my block. I... I couldn't fight back... They..."  
"我下班回来... 他们靠近我，就在我住的那栋楼的门厅里... 他们... 袭击了我。我... 我无力还手... 他们..."

I hush him, I don't need to hear anymore. It's not like many people would have been able to put up much of a fight against two trained members of whatever the group is that is trailing us. Even if he had it probably would have ended up being worse for him.  
我安抚他，不需要再听更多了。面对那些追踪我们的组织的训练有素的成员，没多少人能抵抗多久。即使他能反击，恐怕结果对他会更糟。

"They've been identified?" I ask Fuyutsuki.  
"他们已经被确认身份了？" 我问冬月。

He nods, "Yes, they're with the authorities now and have been relieved of their job. You have my word that they will be punished for this."  
他点头，"是的，他们现在被当局控制，并已被解除职务。我向你保证，他们将为此受到惩罚。"

"And what exactly does that mean Fuyutsuki?" I snap back, "Your word? Why should I..."  
"那究竟意味着什么，冬月？" 我反驳道，"你的保证？我为什么要..."

"A-Asuka... please he... he wants to help, this isn't his fault."  
"A-明日香...请...他...他是想帮忙，这不是他的错。"

I stare a hole through Fuyutsuki. From here I can see he looks ashamed and maybe even a little bit angry himself. Good.  
我盯着冬月，仿佛要将他看穿。从这里我能看出他显得羞愧，甚至可能还有点儿生气。很好。

"I know you don't have a high opinion of me Soryu and I don't blame you. You have every right to hate me but I promise you I will deal with this."  
"我知道你对我评价不高，惣流，我不怪你。你有充分的理由恨我，但我向你保证，我会处理好这件事。"

I look back towards Kaworu, fine, I'll try it their way.  
我回头看向渚薰，好吧，我就试试他们的方式。

"Alright, I won't do anything but you promise me... you promise both me and him... You make a promise Fuyutsuki that you will deal with the two bastards that did this."  
“好吧，我不会做任何事，但你要向我保证……向我和他都保证……你得承诺，福音津，你会处理那两个混蛋。”

"I promise you that Soryu, you too Nagisa. I will deal with this." He bows his head towards us, "I will take my leave now. It seems I am in for a busy night. You will both be alright?"  
“我向你保证，惣流，还有你，渚。我会处理这件事。”他向我们低头，“我现在得走了。看来今晚会很忙。你们俩会没事的吧？”

"Yes. I'll take care of him." I reply coldly.  
“是的，我会照顾他。”我冷冷地回答。

He says his goodbye and leaves the room. I hear the front door close and I let out a sigh before looking once more at Kaworu. I hear him let out a sniff and a tear rolls down his cheek. I squeeze his hand and continue to run my other hand through his hair. I guess I got what I wanted, to see him again only not exactly as I'd have wished it.  
他说完再见，离开了房间。我听到前门关闭的声音，叹了口气，再次看向渚薰。我听到他吸了吸鼻子，一滴泪珠滑过他的脸颊。我握紧他的手，继续用另一只手抚摸他的头发。我想我得到了我想要的，再次见到他，只是并非如我所愿。

"I'm here Kaworu, I'm here as long as you need me to be. You're safe now, I promise."  
“我在这里，渚薰，只要你需要，我会一直在这里。你现在安全了，我保证。”

### Chapter 5: You're Not Alone  
第五章：你并不孤单  

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo 2 – Late afternoon  
东京 2 – 傍晚时分**

"Shinji, I need to speak with you."  
“真嗣，我有话要跟你说。”

I put down the piece of sheet music I'm looking over and look towards Rei as she enters the living room. There is something about her seems, off and I feel a sense of worry as I watch her enter the room. Rei looks worried, immediately I stand up, "Of course, Rei! Is everything alright?"  
我放下正在审阅的乐谱，目光转向丽走进客厅。她似乎有些不对劲，我看着她进屋，心中涌起一丝担忧。丽看起来很焦虑，我立刻站起来，“当然，丽！一切都好吗？”

She makes her way towards me and nods, "It is... fine but I fear I have made a mistake."  
她朝我走来，点了点头，“没事……但我担心自己犯了个错误。”

That slightly worried feeling I had moments before begins to morph into that familiar sense of butterflies in my stomach. It's not like Rei to look nervous or worried like this. Scenarios begin to rush through my head as to what could be wrong. I wonder if someone has hurt her or threatened her in some way.  
之前那股淡淡的担忧开始转化为熟悉的胃里蝴蝶飞舞的感觉。丽这样紧张或担忧的样子并不常见。各种可能出错的情景在我脑海中闪过。我在想是否有人伤害了她或以某种方式威胁了她。

I try to keep myself calm as she instructs me to sit down. I go back to where I was previously and watch as she sits down near to me, she gazes down at the ground awkwardly.  
我尽量保持冷静，按照她的指示坐下。我回到之前的位置，看着她在我附近坐下，她尴尬地低头看着地面。

"What's wrong Rei? Did somebody hurt you?"  
“怎么了，丽？有人伤害你了吗？”

She looks up at me and shakes her head, "No, it is nothing like that but there is something that happened on my recent holiday that you need to know."  
她抬头看着我，摇了摇头，“不，不是那样的，但最近假期发生了一件事，你需要知道。”

"You mean in America? What happened Rei?"  
"你是说在美国？丽发生了什么事？"

Again, scenarios begin to flash through my mind. Did someone take advantage of Rei in America? Did someone threaten her or hurt her in some way? I find it hard to believe someone could have hurt her with the security watching us but then I wonder if maybe she met someone there and they hurt her. I know that unlike myself she has actively dated people, both male and female and has experimented in those ways.  
又一次，各种情景开始在我脑海中闪现。是不是有人在美洲占丽便宜？有人威胁她或以某种方式伤害她吗？我很难相信有人能在我们的安保下伤害她，但随即我又想，也许她在那里遇到了某个人，而那个人伤害了她。我知道，与我自己不同，她积极地与男女都约会过，并在那些方面进行过尝试。

I swallow and wait for her to reply, "Yes, only this incident did not occur in America. I was... In Germany when it occurred. There was something in Germany that I wished to see but then this happened. This is the reason I cut my holiday short. I should have told you sooner about my being in Germany but there were things that needed to be worked out."  
我咽了咽口水，等待她的回答，“是的，只是这件事并非发生在美国。我当时……在德国。那里有我想看的东西，但随后就发生了这件事。这就是我提前结束假期的原因。我本该早点告诉你我在德国的事，但有些事情需要解决。”

I feel a brief sense of relief knowing no one hurt her but was this all she had to tell me? That she was in Germany and then got called to come back. Is this just about her being in Germany and not telling me. I know I worry about her but she doesn't need to tell me everything. On occasion she has been guilty of telling me too much.  
得知没人伤害她，我感到一阵短暂的宽慰，但这就是她要告诉我的全部吗？她在德国，然后被叫回来了。难道只是因为她去了德国却没有告诉我？我知道我担心她，但她不需要告诉我所有事情。偶尔，她也会因为告诉我太多而感到内疚。

Besides Rei is an adult, she can go wherever she wants. I give her a reassuring smile.  
再说了，丽是个成年人，她想去哪儿就去哪儿。我向她露出一个安心的微笑。

"That's fine Rei, I know you've been to Germany before and I know you like it there. I'm guessing Misato found out and asked you to come back early then, I know she can be overprotective of us."  
“没关系，丽，我知道你以前去过德国，而且你喜欢那里。我猜是美里发现了，然后让你提前回来了，我知道她对我们有点过度保护。”

"That was not the end of my story." She says with a hint of impatience in her voice, "The reason I was called back early was not because of my being in Germany but because of what I witnessed whilst there, or at least who I witnessed."  
“那并非我故事的终结。”她带着一丝不耐烦的语气说道，“我被提前召回的原因并非我在德国，而是我在那里目睹了某些事情，或者更确切地说，是目睹了某个人。”

I say absolutely nothing as I sit there in a mixture of confusion and worry. That uneasy feeling I had moments before has returned as I wonder why Rei is so worried about telling me this. I wonder just who or what she could have seen. If it was this bad then it must in some way concern me but I don't understand what it is.  
我坐在那里，一言不发，心中混杂着困惑与忧虑。之前那种不安的感觉再次袭来，我不禁疑惑为何丽为何如此担心告诉我这件事。我好奇她究竟看到了谁或什么。如果情况如此糟糕，那必然与我有关，但我却无法理解其中的缘由。

Unless... I don't think that could be it but what if... What if after all these years she has finally been seen again. She is from Germany so it'd make sense for her to be there and I know Rei would have issues telling me if she saw her.  
除非...我不认为可能是那样，但如果...如果经过这么多年，她终于再次被发现了呢。她来自德国，所以她在那里出现也合情合理，而且我知道，如果丽看到了她，她会有很多顾虑告诉我。

I feel a lump in my throat as I prepare for Rei to say her name. This is a moment I've been waiting for ever since she left. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement, what if it really was her? How am I actually going to feel if Rei does say her name? Excited? Happy? I don't know. I also wonder what it matters if it was her. It's not like she would want to come back here and I don't think we could ever be friends again.  
我感到喉咙哽咽，准备迎接丽说出她的名字。自从她离开后，这一刻我一直在等待。我心中混杂着恐惧与兴奋，如果真的是她呢？如果丽真的说出她的名字，我会是什么感觉？兴奋？高兴？我不知道。我也想知道，如果是她又有什么关系呢。她不可能想回到这里，我也不认为我们还能再做朋友。

I know she hates me for the things I did to her and I can't blame her. It's probably best she does stay away because I'd only hurt her again. I just want to know she is okay though, that she is happy and doing well. I feel Rei's hand around mine as she reveals to me the person she saw.  
我知道她恨我，因为我对她所做的一切，我无法责怪她。也许她最好还是远离，因为我只会再次伤害她。但我只想知道她是否安好，是否快乐，是否过得好。丽握住我的手，向我透露她见到的那个人。

"I saw Kaworu Nagisa." “我见到了渚薰。”

I blink. I blink once more and then all the excitement, all the fear and all the other feelings within me are replaced briefly by a strange numb sensation as I try to process what Rei just said to me. The name floats around my head for a few moments and then I start to feel that lump in my throat swell.  
我眨了眨眼。再次眨眼后，所有的兴奋、恐惧和其他情绪在我体内短暂地被一种奇怪的麻木感所取代，我试图理解丽刚才对我说的话。那个名字在我脑海中飘荡了一会儿，然后我开始感觉到喉咙里的肿块在膨胀。

I look at Rei aware that my eyes are widening. I want to ask her to say that name again but I can't. I can't open my mouth, it's as if my jaw has been wired shut. All at once images flash back to me of my meeting with Kaworu. Images of us talking at the beach, of us doing our sync tests and me staying in his room. Finally, the images turn darker, the descent into Central Dogma, the fight with Unit 02 and then opening Unit 01s hand to reveal that horror of what I had done to Kaworu.  
我看着丽，意识到我的眼睛在睁大。我想让她再说一遍那个名字，但我做不到。我无法张开嘴，仿佛我的下巴被固定住了。突然间，我与薰相遇的画面闪回脑海。我们海滩上的对话，我们的同步测试，我在他房间里的情景。最后，画面变得阴暗，中央教条区的下降，与二号机的战斗，然后打开初号机的手，揭示我所做的对薰的恐怖。

I wonder if maybe I misheard her. Maybe it was another name but I know how idiotic that sounds. Rei wouldn't make a mistake like that, if she saw Kaworu then she saw Kaworu and that was that. I keep my mouth shut firmly, this time not because it feels like it's wired shut but through fear that if I open it I'll be sick.  
我想我可能听错了。也许那是另一个名字，但我知道这听起来多么愚蠢。丽不会犯那样的错误，如果她看到了薰，那就是薰。我紧紧闭上嘴，这次不是因为感觉它被固定住了，而是因为害怕如果我张开嘴，我会呕吐。

I can't believe that he could be alive. I can't believe that Kaworu, my friend for such a brief moment of my life is somehow alive. The boy who befriended me when I had no one else. The boy who betrayed me and the boy that I murdered.  
我无法相信他还活着。我无法相信，在我生命中如此短暂的一瞬结识的朋友——渚薰，竟然还活着。那个在我孤独无依时与我结交的男孩。那个背叛了我，又被我亲手杀死的男孩。

I don't know how to feel about it. Should I be happy at this news? Happy that he came back too along with so many others? Should I be sad or angry at him? I've always tried so hard to not think about Kaworu. I've always tried to put him out of my mind. It's the one memory that I never wanted to revisit and yet I've revisited it so many times over the years. Every moment of our brief couple of days has been replayed in detail in my dreams from the moment I first laid eyes to to his death.  
我不知该如何面对这个消息。我应该为此感到高兴吗？高兴他和那么多人一起回来了？还是应该对他感到悲伤或愤怒？我一直努力不去想渚薰。我一直试图将他从我的脑海中抹去。这是我最不想重温的记忆，然而多年来我却无数次地重温它。从我第一次见到他到他死去的那一刻，我们短暂几天的每一个瞬间都在我的梦中详细重现。

I feel like I should hate him. I know what he did, he took advantage of me and betrayed me. I sunk to my lowest point after that, I did things that were horrible to Asuka and I did nothing as Misato died trying to help me. Yet I cannot hate him. I feel like there was more to him than what I knew, I always wanted to know what that was. I always felt strongly about him, perhaps not as strong as I felt her her but there was something.  
我觉得我应该恨他。我知道他做了什么，他利用了我，背叛了我。那之后我跌入了最低谷，我对明日香做了可怕的事，而当美里试图帮助我时，我却无动于衷地看着她死去。然而我无法恨他。我觉得他还有我不知道的一面，我一直想知道那是什么。我对他总有一种强烈的情感，或许不如我对她的感情那么强烈，但确实存在某种东西。

"I apologize that I did not tell you sooner." Rei interupts my train of thought, "I promise you though, no harm will come to you from him. I will protect you Shinji."  
“我很抱歉没有早点告诉你。” 绫波打断了我的思绪，“但我向你保证，他不会对你造成任何伤害。我会保护你的，真嗣。”

I look back towards Rei, "P-P-Protect me... No... No I don't... I... Ka-Kaworu wouldn't... He..."  
我回头看向绫波，“保-保-保护我...不...不，我不...我...渚薰不会...他...”

Rei runs her thumbs over my hand, "I know what he was and what he did to you. You don't need to be afraid of him, he can't and won't hurt you again."  
绫波用拇指轻抚我的手，“我知道他曾经是什么样的人，以及他对你的所作所为。你不必害怕他，他不能再也不会伤害你了。”

"I-I-I..." I start to stutter and close my mouth again. I have nothing to say to Rei, all I can feel now is the numbness spreading throughout my body. I can feel my chest tighten and my breathing becomes more difficult. Rei quickly moves to sit herself beside me and wraps her arm around my shoulder. My vision blurs as I try to steady my breathing, I try to remember what I've been told whenever this happens. It's been so long since it's happened.  
“我...我...我...”我开始结巴，然后再次闭上了嘴。面对丽，我无话可说，只感到全身麻木在蔓延。我能感觉到胸口发紧，呼吸也变得困难。丽迅速坐到我身边，用胳膊搂住我的肩膀。我努力稳定呼吸，视线却开始模糊，试图回想起每次这种情况发生时别人告诉我的应对方法。已经很久没有发生过了。

Rei wraps me in a warm hug and whispers, "It is okay brother, just breathe. I know this is difficult for you."  
丽给了我一个温暖的拥抱，轻声说：“没事的，哥哥，慢慢呼吸。我知道这对你来说很难。”

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I hold my trembling brother tightly in my arms and wait for his anxiety attack to subside. I'm hit with an overwhelming sense of guilt as I sit there and realize that I have been a terrible sister with what I have done to him. I should have told him this sooner but my failure to act has now only ended up hurting him.  
我紧紧抱着颤抖的弟弟，等待他的恐慌发作平息。坐在那里，我被一股强烈的愧疚感击中，意识到自己作为姐姐是多么糟糕，我对他所做的一切。我本该早点告诉他，但我的不作为现在只让他受了伤。

Seeing his reaction to this only makes me think about how he would react were he to learn about the other secret I am keeping from him. I've been close to telling him about it in the past but now more than ever I feel like he needs to know that she is alive and well. That he needs to know she is still out there but I also feel like I am too deep in my lie.  
看到他对这件事的反应，我不禁思考起如果他得知我隐瞒的另一个秘密，会有何反应。过去我曾几度接近向他坦白，但现在我比任何时候都强烈地觉得，他需要知道她还活着，过得很好。他需要知道她仍在某处，但我同时也深陷于自己的谎言之中。

I'm afraid, not only of his reaction to learning she is alive but also of his reaction to finding out I kept it hidden from him for three years. I know eventually the truth will come out, that is the way of these things but I am afraid of what will happen when it does. It is not only Shinji's reaction that I fear but also Misato's, the woman who took me in and gave me a home for these past years.  
我害怕的不仅是他得知她还活着的反应，还有他发现我隐瞒了三年的真相时的反应。我知道真相终将大白，这是这类事情的必然，但我害怕真相揭晓时会发生什么。我不仅担心真嗣的反应，也担心美里——这位在过去几年里收留我并给我一个家的女人的反应。

I also fear her reaction as well were I to tell them without her permission. I know she wants to keep herself hidden from them and whilst I disagree with her that she should I promised to keep her secret. I would be betraying one of my best friends if I did that, I would also be confirming her fears that everyone would eventually betray her.  
我也害怕未经她允许就告诉他们她的秘密，她的反应会如何。我知道她想避开他们，虽然我不赞同她这样做，但我承诺过保守她的秘密。如果我那样做，就等于背叛了我最好的朋友之一，也会证实她对所有人最终都会背叛她的恐惧。

I just want these people, the ones who I love to be happy and safe and thanks to Nagisa I can no longer feel that they are. Thanks to Nagisa my ideal little world has been torn apart, I did not like keeping the secret before this but it was manageable. With Nagisa there there is a risk, not just to us but to Asuka as well. I don't care what Fuyutsuki tells us, that boy cannot be trusted.  
我只希望我所爱的人能幸福和安全，但多亏了渚，我再也无法感受到他们是如此。多亏了渚，我理想中的小世界已被撕裂，虽然之前保守这个秘密并不容易，但还能应付。有了渚在，不仅我们，还有明日香也面临风险。我不在乎冬月老师怎么说，那男孩不可信任。

"I apologize again Shinji, I know the memory of Nagisa hurts you. I am sorry that I did not tell you about his return sooner but…"  
“再次向真嗣道歉，我知道渚的记忆让你痛苦。很抱歉我没有早点告诉你他回来的事，但是……”

Shinji releases himself from our embrace and shakes his head whilst smiling at me, "N-No… It's fine, I understand why you didn't. I am… I'm not the easiest person when it comes to something like this. I'm sorry I make things so difficult for you. I'm sorry I'm not stronger or better yet!"  
真嗣从我们的拥抱中挣脱出来，摇着头对我微笑，“不……没关系，我理解你为什么没说。我……在这种事情上，我不是最容易相处的人。对不起，我让你这么为难。对不起，我不够坚强，还不够好！”

"Idiot!" I reply to him sharply and silence him by claming my fingers around his lips, "You have nothing to apologize for Shinji. You do not need to be 'stronger' or 'better' you are who you are, you should not apologize for things which you do not need to apologize for."  
"傻瓜！" 我尖锐地回应他，用手指紧贴他的嘴唇让他安静下来，"真嗣，你没有必要道歉。你不需要变得'更坚强'或'更好'，你就是你，不应该为那些不需要道歉的事情道歉。"

I remove my hand and to my surprise he actually lets out a laugh, "You know… You almost reminded me of… Well you know who I mean. When you told me off it sounded just like she did."  
我移开手，令我惊讶的是他竟然笑了出来，"你知道吗……你几乎让我想起了……嗯，你知道我说的是谁。你训斥我的时候，听起来和她一模一样。"

I try to ignore that feeling of guilt swelling inside of me as he talks about Asuka. I try to cast the thought of her aside. I cannot tell them yet about her. Not after he has just learned about Nagisa. Instead I must focus on making him feel better, focus on helping him in the here and now.  
他提到明日香时，我努力忽视内心涌起的愧疚感。我试图抛开关于她的念头。在他刚刚得知渚的事情后，我还不能告诉他们关于她的事。相反，我必须集中精力让他感觉好些，专注于在此刻帮助他。

"I apologize, I do not mean to insult you."  
"我道歉，无意冒犯你。"

Shinji carries on smiling, "No… You didn't insult me. You were right Rei and when she used to say it she was right. I do… apologize too much, I know it myself and I try hard not to. It's just too easy to do so, it's too easy to blame myself for everything…"  
真嗣继续微笑着，"不…你没有冒犯我。你说得对，丽，她以前这么说也是对的。我确实…道歉得太多了，我自己也知道，并且努力不去这样做。只是太容易了，把一切都归咎于自己太容易了…"

"I feel that, despite how harsh she could be that sometimes Soryu did have a point regarding us all."  
"我觉得，尽管她有时可能很严厉，但关于我们所有人，索留有时候确实说得有道理。"

Shinji nods, "Yeah… Do… Do you miss her Rei? I know you two never really got along."  
真嗣点头，“嗯……你……你会想念她吗，绫波？我知道你们俩一直不太合得来。”

"Yes I do. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to know her better and perhaps be her friend. I regret how cold I was towards her in the past and I think I would have liked to correct that. The truth is I did come to admire Soryu in a number of ways, I admired her strength, her fierceness and her compassion."  
“是的，我会想念她。我本希望能有机会更好地了解她，或许成为她的朋友。我后悔过去对她那么冷淡，我想我本希望能改正这一点。事实上，我确实在许多方面敬佩惣流，我敬佩她的坚强、她的勇敢以及她的同情心。”

"I know what you mean, she always had a way of getting us fired up and… she always made sure to include everyone."  
“我明白你的意思，她总是有办法让我们充满干劲，而且……她总是确保每个人都包括在内。”

"Yes, I was always appreciative of that." I reply to him, "At first I found her attempts to pull me into the group irritating but… I look back on it fondly. I now appreciate those moments."  
"是的，我一直很感激那一点。" 我回答他，"起初我觉得她试图拉我进团体的举动很烦人，但……现在回想起来，我感到很温馨。我现在很珍惜那些时刻。"

"Yeah… Do you… Do you think she is alright?"  
"嗯……你……你觉得她还好吗？"

"I do. Wherever Soryu is now I believe she is doing fine."  
"我相信是的。无论曹现在在哪里，我相信她一切都好。"

Shinji bows his head, "I hope so Rei, she deserves to be happy."  
真嗣低下头，“我也希望如此，丽，她值得幸福。”

That feeling of guilt, the lead in my soul continues to weigh down heavily on my heart as I hear Shinji speak. Yet I can do nothing about it, all I can do is sit there and pretend I don't know anything about Asuka or her current condition. I have to pretend that I don't know that she misses him as much as he misses her. I have to replace the 'I know' and 'She is' with 'I believe' and 'I hope.'  
那种愧疚感，我灵魂中的铅块继续沉重地压在心上，当我听到真嗣说话时。然而我对此无能为力，我只能坐在那里，假装对明日香或她目前的状况一无所知。我必须假装不知道她和他一样思念对方。我必须用“我相信”和“我希望”来代替“我知道”和“她是”。

I'm sorry Shinji, I have not been a good sister to you.  
对不起，真嗣，我没有成为一个好姐姐。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin – Late Evening 柏林 —— 深夜**

I try to keep my eyes on the large screen as my fingers press down on the controllers trigger and the car continues to drive forward. It moves down a large dip in the road and starts to gain speed, I slow it just enough in order to take the next sharp corner. As it turns the corner I watch as the back of the car starts to spin out, I try to remember the advice I've read for this and adjust for it. I'm able to get it back under control and the car now drives forward on a long straight.  
我努力将目光锁定在大屏幕上，手指按下控制器的扳机，汽车继续前行。它驶入道路的一个大下坡，速度开始增加，我及时减速以应对下一个急转弯。转弯时，我看到车尾开始打滑，我试图回忆起之前读过的建议并进行调整。最终，我成功控制住了局面，汽车平稳地沿着一条长直道前行。

I keep on driving it forward, being careful to watch my speed knowing that I can't make any mistakes. On screen it drives through a large puddle and little droplets of water splash up onto the games camera and partially obscures my view. I allow myself a quick glance at the minimap, just one more corner and I'll be finished.  
我继续小心翼翼地驾驶，时刻注意速度，深知不能有任何差错。屏幕上，汽车穿过一片大水坑，水花四溅，游戏摄像头的视野被部分遮挡。我快速瞥了一眼小地图，再过一个弯道，我就完成了。

Finally the car crosses the finish line and I feel a genuine sense of accomplishment. My results flash up on screen, third place, whilst I did not win it is still much better than I did when I first bought the game. I lean forward and sit the controller down on my coffee table. I let out a soft groan as I feel a twinge in my ribs, a reminder of what happened to me only a couple of hours ago.  
终于，赛车越过了终点线，我感受到了一种真正的成就感。我的成绩显示在屏幕上，第三名，虽然没有夺冠，但这比我刚买游戏时好多了。我向前倾身，将控制器放在咖啡桌上。我轻轻地呻吟了一声，肋骨处传来一阵刺痛，提醒我几个小时前发生的事情。

The game goes back to the main title screen and I contemplate having another race but I decide against it. I instead look towards my hallway nervously, hoping that Asuka will return to me soon. She said that she would try to be as quick as possible but we found that getting her a taxi back to her place on this particular night was difficult.  
游戏回到了主标题屏幕，我考虑再来一场比赛，但还是决定放弃。我紧张地望向走廊，希望明日香能尽快回来。她说她会尽量快些，但今晚我们发现给她叫一辆回她家的出租车很困难。

Naturally my mind jumps directly to the worst case scenarios. What if she too has been attacked as I was? I wonder if maybe I should have gone with her but my condition would not allow it. I did offer but she was very forceful in telling me that I had to stay here and rest. I did not wish to argue with her.  
自然而然，我的脑海直接跳到了最坏的情况。如果她也像我一样被袭击了怎么办？我在想，也许我应该陪她一起去，但我的身体状况不允许。我确实提出过，但她非常坚决地告诉我必须留在这里休息。我不想和她争论。

My mind jumps to another scenario, what if she doesn't come back? What if what has happened has reminded her of what it is I was and she has turned her back on me. I would not blame her and yet I really hope that is not what has happened. I am thankful for her friendship and adore her company. Whilst the circumstances of our being brought together tonight were not how I would have liked them to be I find myself glad that she is here.  
我的思绪跳跃到另一个场景，如果她不回来了怎么办？如果发生的事情让她想起了我曾经的样子，她会不会已经转身离开了我。我不会怪她，但我真的希望事情不是这样。我感激她的友谊，喜欢她的陪伴。尽管今晚我们相遇的情景并非我所愿，但我还是很高兴她在这里。

I cast that second thought out of my mind. If Asuka had no intention of returning she would not have took a copy of the key to the apartment. Nor would she have said she would return. I do not believe Asuka would be the sort to break such a promise. Yet without her here now I start to feel the fear and vulnerability set in.  
我抛开了第二个念头。如果明日香没有回来的打算，她就不会拿走公寓钥匙的副本，也不会说她会回来。我不认为明日香会是那种违背承诺的人。然而，她现在不在这里，我开始感到恐惧和脆弱袭来。

Worst of all I am beginning to feel that I deserved what happened to me. I feel that those people were right in attacking me and that maybe I actually deserved worse. I let out a sigh and bring my feet up onto the couch hugging my knees to my chest. I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes once more. I dislike this fear and pain so much and I dislike the voice I my head telling me what I deserve it even moreso.  
最糟糕的是，我开始觉得自己活该遭受这一切。我觉得那些攻击我的人是对的，也许我真的应该受到更严重的惩罚。我叹了口气，把脚抬到沙发上，抱紧膝盖。我能感觉到泪水再次在眼眶中打转。我非常讨厌这种恐惧和痛苦，更讨厌脑海中那个告诉我这是应得的声音。

I do not want to feel this way anymore. I want to believe Asuka and Fuyutsuki when they say to me that my actions all those years ago weren't all my fault. I want to believe them when they say that I was a victim but I don't feel like I was a victim. I can still remember everything, I can remember each and every thought I had on that day, the day I betrayed my first ever friend and tore their world apart.  
我不想再这样下去了。我想相信明日香和冬月老师，他们说我多年前所做的一切并不全是我的错。我想相信他们说我是受害者，但我并不觉得自己是受害者。我仍然记得一切，我记得那天我背叛了我的第一个朋友，撕裂了他们的世界时，每一个念头。

I remember thinking that humanity had reached its natural conclusion, that it was no longer worthy of this world and time for them to move on and be replaced. I can remember thinking that because that is what they told me. They told me that humanity had to die and I believed it. I believed it right up until I saw Lilith in that chamber. Then I knew… I knew I was little more than a puppet and that all there was for me was death. Yet I embraced it because death would be my escape, an end to the risk I posed those people and an end to the loneliness I felt being the soul being of my kind.  
我记得当时认为人类已经走到了自然终结的时刻，不再配得上这个世界，是时候让他们离开，被取代了。我记得这样想是因为他们这样告诉我的。他们说人类必须灭亡，我信以为真。直到我看到那个房间里的莉莉丝，我才明白……我知道自己不过是傀儡，我的结局只有死亡。然而我接受了它，因为死亡将是我的解脱，结束我对那些人的威胁，也结束我作为同类中唯一灵魂的孤独。

I'm snapped from my thoughts by a sudden noise from the hallway. I jump in fright and hug my knees closer to my chest as the door opens. A moment later Asuka calls out to me, "I'm back, sorry I took so damn long. Took me a while to find my stuff and then the damn taxi refused to wait so I had to call Fuyutsuki to send a car for me and…"  
一阵突如其来的走廊噪音将我从思绪中惊醒。我吓了一跳，紧紧抱住膝盖，门随即打开。片刻后，明日香对我喊道：“我回来了，抱歉花了这么长时间。找东西花了些时间，然后那该死的出租车不肯等，我只好打电话让冬月派辆车来接我，还有……”

Asuka stops herself in mid-sentence as she enters the room and looks across at me huddled on the sofa. I'm aware of how pathetic I must look but she makes no comment about it. Instead she drops the backpack and makes her way to the sofa and puts an arm around my shoulder. I feel instantly calmed by her warm touch.  
明日香走进房间，看到我蜷缩在沙发上，话说到一半突然停了下来。我知道自己看起来一定很可怜，但她对此只字未提。相反，她放下背包，走到沙发旁，用一只手臂搂住我的肩膀。她温暖的触碰让我立刻感到平静。

From there I see her look up at the screen, my results are still there and she smiled, "Third place! You're getting better Kaworu, still a huge distance from my lap times but definitely better than when you first started! I mean that video you sent me was hilarious."  
接着，我看到她抬头看向屏幕，我的成绩还在上面，她笑了笑说：“第三名！你进步了，真嗣，虽然离我的圈速还有很大差距，但肯定比刚开始时好多了！我是说，你发给我的那个视频真是太搞笑了。”

I let my legs drop to the ground and groan as my ribs ache again. I smile as I turn to her, "I admit I am enjoying the console but I am having some difficulty in adjusting to the games. That video… was not my proudest moment."  
我让双腿垂到地上，随着肋骨再次疼痛而呻吟。我转向她，微笑道：“我承认我很享受这台游戏机，但我还在适应游戏的过程中有些困难。那个视频……并不是我最自豪的时刻。”

"No but making a car do that many flips is an achievement all on its own." Asuka laughs.  
“不，但能让车翻那么多圈本身就是一项成就。”明日香笑着说。

"I am finding that I like this game, it is difficult in places but not overly so to put me off or frustrate me. I am able to easily learn at my own pace and do not feel pressure to succeed. I find that with the shooting games I am struggling to adapt to the control methods, moving the character and camera at the same time is a struggle. That other game you recommended I am having a lot of difficulty progressing in. I have made to a… boss character I believe they are called but it kills me instantly. It is frustrating because with each death I seem to lose any progress I have made."  
“我发现我喜欢这个游戏，虽然有些地方颇具挑战性，但并不至于让我放弃或感到沮丧。我可以按照自己的节奏轻松学习，不会感到成功的压力。我发现自己在射击游戏中很难适应控制方式，同时移动角色和摄像头很困难。你推荐的那个游戏，我在里面进展很艰难。我已经到了一个……应该是叫 Boss 的角色那里，但它立刻就把我干掉了。这很令人沮丧，因为每次死亡似乎都会让我失去所有进展。”

Asuka smirks and nods, "Well I did think that one might be a bit difficult but it is one that everyone should play. You just need to be patient with it, try to watch what the boss does and adjust for it. There are always patterns to the attacks and ways of countering it. As far as the progress goes, well you are spending the points you earn when you kill enemies right?"  
明日香微微一笑，点头道：“嗯，我确实觉得这个可能有点难度，但这是每个人都应该尝试的。你只需要对它有耐心，观察 Boss 的行动并做出相应的调整。攻击总是有模式的，也有应对的方法。至于进度，你是在击杀敌人后正确地使用获得的点数吗？”

I offer her only a blank stare and she shakes her head and sighs, "I should have known! I'll have to show you how it's done won't I?"  
我只能茫然地看着她，她摇摇头叹了口气，“我早该料到的！看来我得亲自示范给你看，对吧？”

"I… Would appreciate that."  
“我……会很感激的。”

"Well don't expect me to do it for you! I'll show you my recordings and give you advice whilst you play. You're not going to improve unless you do it yourself!"  
“别指望我替你做！我会给你看我的录像并给你建议，但你要自己玩。不亲自实践你是不会进步的！”

I can't help but smile at her offer, "That sounds like fun."  
她的话让我不禁微笑，“听起来很有趣。”

Asuka then picks up the controller from the coffee table and shoots me another smile as she sets up a track for herself. I can see that the track seems to be one of the more advanced ones in the game, to go alongside it she picks one of the faster cars.  
接着，明日香从茶几上拿起控制器，又对我笑了笑，为自己选了一条赛道。我看得出这条赛道是游戏里较为高级的，她选了一辆速度更快的赛车来搭配。

"Now, you watch and learn Kaworu. I'll show you how this is done!"  
"现在，你看好了，薰。我会教你这是怎么做到的！"

A little under ten minutes later Asuka crosses the finish line of the track managing to get a time that not only has her in first place but also in the top 250 on the online leaderboards. She triumphantly sets the controller back down and grins, "See, nothing to it! That's how you win a race, patience, smooth driving and no mistakes!"  
不到十分钟后，明日香越过了赛道终点线，她的成绩不仅让她位居第一，还进入了在线排行榜的前 250 名。她得意地将控制器放回原位，笑着说：“看吧，没什么难的！赢得比赛靠的是耐心、平稳驾驶和零失误！”

Whilst Asuka says there was nothing to it I could see quite clearly there was a lot to it and I dread to think how I would fare on that track. I watched it as Asuka skilfully navigated a large number of difficult and sharp turns with ease, looked on as she went through the water hazards and up and down banks without it even affecting her.  
虽然明日香说这没什么，但我清楚地看到这其中有很多技巧，我都不敢想象自己在那条赛道上的表现会如何。我看着明日香熟练地轻松应对大量困难且急转弯，观察她穿越水域障碍，上下坡道，而这一切对她几乎没有影响。

At the same time my eyes were not entirely glued to the screen. I couldn't help it but every now and then I would find myself glancing towards Asuka. She is, in all honesty such a beautiful person. I can't help but feel fortunate to have encountered her and struck up this friendship. She has such a kind soul despite all the pain I know she has suffered. She radiates an aura of confidence that only serves to empower me.  
与此同时，我的目光并未完全锁定在屏幕上。我情不自禁地时不时会瞥向明日香。说实话，她真是一个美丽的人。能遇到她并建立起这份友谊，我感到无比幸运。尽管我知道她经历了许多痛苦，但她拥有一颗善良的心，散发着自信的光芒，这让我也倍感鼓舞。

I feel so safe around her as well. With her here I feel like nothing can harm me. She is wonderful. I'm snapped away from my thoughts of Asuka by a sudden knock at the door. Once again I jump in fright and I feel redness in my cheeks as I quickly pull my eyes away from Asuka.  
在她身边，我感到无比安全。有她在，仿佛没有什么能伤害到我。她真是太棒了。突然的敲门声打断了我的思绪。我又一次被吓了一跳，脸颊泛红，迅速将视线从明日香身上移开。

She leaps up from the sofa, "That'll be the food we ordered! Be back in a second."  
她从沙发上一跃而起，“那应该是我们点的外卖！马上回来。”

Asuka gets up and I find my eyes tracking her as she moves into the passageway to answer the door. My eyes wander all the way down her body and I feel the blush in my cheeks increasing. I try to hastily think about something else than her figure. The more I try the more I can't help it, I feel a strange sort of giddiness in my stomach that I've only ever felt once before when thinking about someone.  
明日香起身，我发现自己不由自主地随着她的移动而目光追随，看着她走向通道去开门。我的视线一路下滑至她的全身，脸上不由得泛起红晕。我急忙试图转移思绪，不去想她的身姿。然而越是努力，越是难以自控，心中涌起一种奇异的兴奋感，这种感觉在我之前想到某个人时也只出现过一次。

A second later I'm hit with that feeling of guilt. I shouldn't be looking at Asuka's figure in such a way or thinking of her like that. I shouldn't be thinking about what it would be like to hold her in my arms. I shouldn't be thinking about what it might feel like to kiss her lips. I definitely shouldn't be thinking about other rogue thoughts that threaten to sneak in there.  
片刻之后，那种愧疚感再次袭来。我不该以这种方式打量明日香的身姿，也不该那样想她。我不该幻想将她拥入怀中的感觉。我不该想象亲吻她双唇的滋味。更不该让那些不正经的念头悄悄溜进脑海。

Thankfully she returns a few seconds later balancing a few large boxes in her hands and with a bottle of something tucked under her arm. I am eagerly anticipating this meal and I can feel my mouth begin to water as the smell from the food infiltrates my nostrils.  
幸好她几秒钟后就回来了，双手稳稳地捧着几个大盒子，腋下还夹着一瓶什么东西。我对这顿饭满怀期待，随着食物的香气钻入鼻孔，我的口水已经开始分泌。

Asuka was somewhat shocked to learn I have not sampled pizza yet. She insisted on ordering from a place she knows, she also insisted on paying. I did try to tell her I would not mind paying but Asuka was very forceful. I did not argue.  
明日香得知我还没尝过披萨，有些惊讶。她坚持要从她知道的一家店订餐，并且执意要付款。我试图告诉她我不介意付钱，但明日香非常坚决。我没有争辩。

As Asuka sets the boxes down on the coffee table and goes to grab some glasses from the kitchen I look at the feast waiting for us and wonder if maybe I was wrong about music. Perhaps this ability to order delicious food and have it delivered to your home is the height of human culture.  
当明日香把盒子放在茶几上，去厨房拿杯子时，我看着等待我们的盛宴，心想或许我对音乐的看法是错的。也许这种能订购美味食物并送货上门的能力，才是人类文化的巅峰。

She returns and we begin to enjoy our food and spend the rest of the night playing games and enjoying ourselves. She shows me how to defeat that boss I was having difficulty with and we play each other a few times on the football game I bought. I even manage to win a couple of matches.  
她回来后，我们开始享用食物，整个晚上都在玩游戏，尽情享受。她教我如何打败那个我之前一直打不过的 Boss，我们还互相在刚买的足球游戏上较量了几局。我甚至赢了几场比赛。

Before long I feel tiredness creep over me and I excuse myself to go to bed. I find a spare duvet and pillows and give them to Asuka before thanking her and bidding her goodnight. I'm about to enter my bedroom when she wishes me goodnight and hugs me, she tells me she hopes I sleep well.  
不久我便感到困意袭来，于是借口去睡觉。我找到一床多余的被子和枕头，递给明日香，然后向她道谢并道晚安。正当我准备进入卧室时，她向我道晚安并拥抱了我，她说希望我能睡个好觉。

As I drift off to sleep that night I find myself cuddling my duvet tight to my chest trying to recapture the feeling of being hugged my Asuka. It is a peculiar feeling to know that what started as one of the most horrific and terrifying nights of my life has somehow managed to change into one of the best. Tonight, I do not feel the guilt and fear I usually do when I try to fall asleep. Instead I feel calm and peaceful as I think of the girl sleeping in the room next to mine.  
那晚入睡时，我发现自己紧紧抱着被子，试图重温被明日香拥抱的感觉。知道这样一个原本恐怖至极的夜晚竟能转变为最美好的时刻之一，这种感觉颇为奇妙。今晚，当我试图入睡时，不再感到往常的愧疚和恐惧。相反，想到隔壁房间里熟睡的女孩，我感到平静而安宁。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I find myself walking down a street, one I haven't walked down in many years. One that in all honesty shouldn't exist anymore and the clothes I'm wearing are ones that I shouldn't be wearing. Yet here I am in the uniform of the Tokyo-3 Junior High School. I continue to walk down the deserted street towards my destination. Why am I here? Where is everybody?  
我发现自己走在一条街上，一条多年未曾踏足的街道。说实话，这条街本不该存在了，而我身上的衣服也不该是我穿的。然而，我正穿着第三新东京市立初中的校服。我继续向着目的地走去，这条空无一人的街道。我为何会在这里？其他人都去哪儿了？

I round the corner and see the school gates in front of me. Finally I can see people but I freeze upon recognizing exactly who they are. Panic rises up in my chest, it's Kaworu and... and… that boy. They're stood facing one another and talking. They're talking and smiling and laughing and joking with one another. They both look so happy, happier than I've ever seen them.  
我转过街角，眼前便是学校的大门。终于能看到人了，但我一认出他们是谁，便僵住了。恐慌在胸中升起，是渚薰和……那个男孩。他们面对面站着，交谈着。他们在说笑，在欢笑，在互相打趣。他们看起来如此快乐，比我见过的任何时候都要快乐。

I take a step back feeling something else rising up inside of me. It's like a churning in my stomach but not one that makes me feel sick. No it's worse somehow, it's jealousy. Jealousy that I'm watching these two people talking so nonchalantly and I'm not there with them. Jealousy that I'm watching Kaworu take Shinji's hand and slowly raising it to his lips.  
我后退了一步，感觉内心涌起了另一种情绪。像是胃里的翻腾，但又不是那种让人恶心的感觉。不，某种程度上更糟，是嫉妒。嫉妒我看着这两个人如此随意地交谈，而我却不在他们身边。嫉妒我看着渚薰握住真嗣的手，缓缓将其举到唇边。

I try to walk forward but my legs feel heavy. There is nothing but pain as I slowly drag one leg forward. I have to reach them in time. I need to talk to them both but what am I going to say?  
我试图向前走，但双腿沉重。每拖动一步，只有痛苦相伴。我必须及时赶到他们身边。我需要和他们俩谈谈，但我该说什么呢？

_'You're going to tell them what you think of them of course!'  
'你当然要告诉他们你对他们的看法！'_

I hear the girl next to me call out. I try to ignore her.  
我听到旁边的女孩大声说道。我试图忽视她。

_'Look at them both, both the objects of your desire. You one you ran away from and the one you're going to run away from.'  
'看看他们俩，都是你心中的渴望。一个你逃离了，另一个你也将逃离。'_

"No… No I'm not." I reply, "I'm not going to run away from him."  
“不…不，我不是。”我回答，“我不会从他身边逃走的。”

I keep on trying to move forward but my legs, they hurt so goddamn much. Why am I feeling this pain?  
我一直在努力前进，但我的腿，它们疼得要命。为什么我会感到这种痛苦？

_'Yes you are. Of course you are because that's what you have to do. If you don't you know what'll happen. You'll just hurt him, same as you did to Shinji. You're no good for him.'  
“是的，你当然会。因为你必须这么做。如果你不这样做，你知道会发生什么。你会像对待真嗣那样伤害他。你对他没好处。”_

I shake my head, it isn't like that. It isn't like that at all. I'm his friend, I want to be his friend. I don't want to hurt him, I won't hurt him! I promise I won't!  
我摇摇头，事情不是那样的。根本不是那样的。我是他的朋友，我只想做他的朋友。我不想伤害他，我不会伤害他！我保证我不会！

I keep on moving forward, painfully dragging myself forward trying to get to the two of them. They're still stood there talking and laughing. Shinji has his arms around Kaworu's neck now and I feel that churning increase.  
我继续向前移动，痛苦地拖着自己试图接近他们俩。他们还站在那里谈笑风生。真嗣现在正搂着渚薰的脖子，我感到那种翻腾感愈发强烈。

_'You long for that don't you. Long for either one of their embrace but you can't have it. You ran away from him, you can't even bring yourself to speak his name can you? You can't even think his name! It'll be exactly the same for Kaworu, you'll hurt him and you'll run away!'  
"“你渴望那样对吧。渴望他们中的任何一个的拥抱，但你得不到。你从他身边逃走了，你甚至无法提起他的名字，对吧？你甚至无法想起他的名字！对渚薰也会是一样的，你会伤害他，然后再次逃离！”_

I'm about to reach the gates when I hear the bell ring. I try to shout out to the pair of them, my mouth opens as I try to speak Kaworu's name but no words come out. I then try in desperation to say his name but I can't. I don't deserve to speak either of their names. I stop and watch in despair as the two of them walk towards the school hand in hand. There is nothing I can do but stand there propping myself up against the gate.  
我即将到达校门时，听到了铃声响起。我试图向他们两人呼喊，嘴巴张开想要说出渚薰的名字，却发不出任何声音。我绝望地再次尝试呼唤他的名字，但依旧无法做到。我不配叫出他们中任何一个人的名字。我停下脚步，绝望地看着他们手牵手走向学校。除了靠在校门上支撑自己，我无能为力。

As I watch I hear a strange noise. I hear three clicks followed by a loud crack, I turn around and see the version of me who has been taunting me stood there. She's wearing a chef's hat now and carrying a bowl in which she's just cracked a number of eggs into it.  
当我注视着他们时，听到了一个奇怪的声音。先是三声咔哒，紧接着是一声巨响，我转过身，看到那个一直嘲弄我的‘我’站在那里。她现在戴着一顶厨师帽，手里拿着一个碗，刚刚往里面打进了几个鸡蛋。

_'Good morning Asuka!' '早上好，明日香！'_

My eyes slowly open as dream fades away. I feel the sting of tears in my eyes and for some reason I can still feel that churning in my stomach. It was a dream, it was all just another goddamn dream in which I come out of it feeling horrible. Another dream in which I see him and can't even speak to him or get close to him only now Kaworu seems to have made an appearance too.  
我的眼睛缓缓睁开，梦境逐渐消散。我感到眼中有泪水的刺痛，不知为何，胃里那种翻腾的感觉依然存在。那只是一个梦，一切不过是又一个该死的梦，醒来后感觉糟糕透顶。又一个梦，梦中我见到他，却连话都说不出口，也无法靠近他，而现在，渚薰似乎也出现了。

I take a few calming breaths and lay still. My eyes flicker around the space in front of me, I'm in Kaworu's front room. I'm safe and lying on his sofa. In front of me is a coffee table with boxes of pizza and empty glasses. I'm not… I'm not a bad person and I'm not… going to run away. I'm Kaworu's friend, I promised I'd be there for him and he isn't going to abandon me.  
我深呼吸几次，静静躺着。目光在面前的空间游移，我身处渚薰家的客厅。我安全地躺在他的沙发上。眼前是一张咖啡桌，上面摆着披萨盒和空杯子。我不是……我不是坏人，也不会……逃跑。我是渚薰的朋友，我承诺过会支持他，他也不会抛弃我。

A second later my nostrils are hit by an array of pleasant smells. I hear a noise from the kitchen and suddenly sit up and look towards the source of the sound. I see the light is on and Kaworu is stood there looking over a number of pans, breakfast ingredients set out over the counters. I suppose… that explains the eggs.  
片刻后，我的鼻腔被一阵宜人的香气包围。厨房传来声响，我突然坐起身，朝声音的来源望去。看到灯光亮着，渚薰站在那里，俯视着几个平底锅，早餐食材摆满了台面。我想……这解释了鸡蛋的存在。

"K-Kaworu…" I rub my eyes as I call out to him, "What are you doing?"  
"K-Kaworu…" 我揉着眼睛呼唤他，"你在做什么？"

Kaworu slowly turns around and shoots me a smile. I try to smile back at him but in my tired state it turns into a yawn. From here I can still see the effects of the attack last night. I was able to clean up as much as I could and some of the swelling as gone down. He looks rough but it's an improvement over last night. His smile though, his smile seems as sweet as it did when I first saw it.  
Kaworu 缓缓转过身来，向我投以微笑。我试图回以微笑，但在疲惫的状态下却变成了一个哈欠。从这里我仍能看到昨晚攻击的影响。我尽可能地清理了现场，一些肿胀已经消退。他看起来有些憔悴，但比起昨晚有所改善。然而，他的微笑，他的微笑依旧如我初次见到时那般甜美。

"My apologies Asuka, I did not wake you, did I?" He finally says.  
"抱歉，Asuka，我没有吵醒你吧？" 他终于说道。

I shake my head, in truth he did but I'm thankful that he did, I didn't want to see how that dream would have panned out, "No. I was just waking up anyway."  
我摇了摇头，实际上他确实这么做了，但我很感激他，我不想看到那个梦会如何发展，“不，反正我也正要醒来了。”

He turns away for a moment to monitor something in one of the frying pans. Just at that moment I spot some toast pop up out of the toaster. One by one I start to identify the various smells coming from the kitchen and my stomach growls in response. At the same time I can't help but frown at him as I watch him limp over to the toaster.  
他转过身去，查看其中一个煎锅里的东西。就在这时，我看到一些吐司从烤面包机里弹出来。我开始一一辨认厨房里传来的各种香味，我的肚子随之咕噜作响。与此同时，我看着他一瘸一拐地走向烤面包机，忍不住皱起了眉头。

"I thought I told you to rest!" I try to sound commanding but let out another yawn as I finish my sentence, "I said I'd handle things!"  
“我以为我告诉你要休息！”我试图用命令的语气说话，但说完后又打了个哈欠，“我说过我会处理这些事的！”

Kaworu lowers his head and smiled back at me, "I know but I would not feel right you doing everything for me and also, I wanted to repay your kindness in some way. I have heard that breakfast in bed is seen as a kind gesture among humans and thought you would appreciate it. I am unable to do many things but cooking is something that I feel I am competent at."  
渚薰低下头，对我微笑着说：“我知道，但我不希望你为我做所有事情，而且，我也想以某种方式回报你的好意。我听说在人类中，床上早餐被视为一种体贴的举动，我想你会喜欢的。虽然我做不了很多事情，但烹饪是我感觉自己还算擅长的事情。”

I face reddens at his words, he was going to make me breakfast in bed. He was actually going to the effort of doing that for me. All I can do is mumble under my breath, "Idiot… You don't need to repay me for anything."  
听到他的话，我的脸颊泛起了红晕，他竟然要为我做床上早餐。他真的愿意为我付出这样的努力。我只能低声咕哝：“傻瓜……你不需要为我做任何回报。”

I sit on the sofa and watch him moving around the kitchen and I feel myself smiling as I do so. He seems content and happy to be doing this. He seems at peace, just as he did last night when we were playing games together. As I watch him I begin to feel that butterfly like churning in my stomach again only this time it isn't jealousy, it's something else entirely and something that should feel nice.  
我坐在沙发上，看着他在厨房里忙碌，不由得微笑起来。他似乎很满足，也很高兴做这些。他显得很平静，就像昨晚我们一起玩游戏时那样。看着他，我再次感到胃里那种蝴蝶般的翻腾，但这次不是嫉妒，而是完全不同的感觉，一种应该让人感到愉悦的感觉。

Except it doesn't feel nice because it frightens me. I shouldn't be allowed to feel this because I can never be that person for anyone. I can never be that person who likes someone and lets them like me back because of who I am.  
只是这种感觉并不美好，因为它让我感到害怕。我不应该有这样的感觉，因为我永远无法成为任何人心目中的那个人。我永远无法成为那种喜欢某人并让他们因为我是谁而喜欢我的人。

I turn away and sit back on the sofa shaking my head. As I do so Rei's warnings enter my mind as well. She warned me to stay away from Kaworu because he is dangerous but it isn't me who should be afraid of him. It's the other way around. Only I can't leave now, I made a promise and I'm not going to break that promise.  
我转过身，坐回到沙发上，摇着头。与此同时，丽的话也浮现在我的脑海中。她警告我要远离渚薰，因为他很危险，但真正应该害怕的不是我，而是他。只是我现在不能离开，我许下了一个承诺，我不会违背那个承诺。

I need to speak to someone but my options are limited to two people. Kaworu or Rei, neither of which seem like good candidates for this conversation. I turn again to see Kaworu is finishing putting things out on the plate and he looks over, "I'm nearly finished do you want me to bring it over to you or shall we eat over here?"  
我需要找人谈谈，但我的选择仅限于两个人。渚薰或丽，似乎都不是合适的谈话对象。我再次转头，看到渚薰正在把东西摆到盘子上，他抬头看向我，“我快准备好了，你想让我把食物端给你，还是我们在这里吃？”

I shake my head, "Over there please, I'll just be a moment."  
我摇摇头，“请到那边去，我马上就好。”

I ignore the previous thoughts. I can't focus on things like this on an empty stomach, I'll eat and enjoy today and then figure out what to do. I start to stand up off of the sofa and as I do I look over towards the lone chair and spot a piece of plain red fabric hanging off of it that looks suspiciously like my nightshirt. I gaze at it again, it is my nightshirt.  
我忽略了之前的思绪。空腹时无法专注于这类事情，我要先吃东西并享受今天，然后再考虑该怎么办。我准备从沙发上站起来，就在这时，我朝那把孤零零的椅子看去，发现上面挂着一块纯红色的布料，看起来很像我的睡衣。我又仔细看了看，确实是我的睡衣。

I lift up the duvet that is wrapped around me and look down to see my exposed breasts and stomach and look back at the nightshirt in horror. I remember what happened now, I woke up in the middle of the night and was too hot. I forgot where I was and removed my shirt throwing it onto the chair. I think about what happened to Kaworu in my apartment and realize something, the universe hates us.  
我掀开裹在身上的被子，低头看到自己裸露的胸部和腹部，惊恐地看向那件睡衣。现在我想起来了，半夜醒来时太热了。我忘了自己在哪里，脱下衬衫扔到了椅子上。我想起在公寓里对渚薰做过的事，意识到一件事，宇宙似乎对我们怀有敌意。

I know the easy thing to do would be to just ask him to get it for me, I know that'd be so simple but I also can't do that. I may as well expose myself to him by doing that, would seem like the same thing. I try to ignore the voice in my head that urges me to expose myself to him. That'd it'd be only fair after what I got to see the other week. I can almost imagine the Asuka from my dream taunting me.  
我知道最简单的办法就是直接让他帮我拿过来，我也知道那样做很简单，但我就是做不到。那样做无异于向他暴露自己，感觉就像是一回事。我努力忽视脑海中那个催促我向他暴露的声音。毕竟上周我看到了不该看的，这样做似乎才公平。我几乎能想象到梦中的明日香在嘲弄我。

_'Go ahead and let him see all of you. You know he's going to like it, you saw him stealing glances at you all of last night. You know he likes you, don't you think he'd appreciate getting to see that?'  
'大胆让他看个够吧。你知道他会喜欢的，昨晚你不是看到他一直在偷瞄你吗？你知道他喜欢你，你不觉得他会欣赏这一幕吗？'_

I tell myself to shut up and start to stretch my hand out towards the chair whilst also using the other one to keep the duvet wrapped around my topless body. Please don't fall, please don't slip, please just let me grab the damn top and put it on. Please don't let him see me.  
我告诉自己闭嘴，一边伸手去够椅子，一边用另一只手紧紧裹住被子，遮住上半身。千万别掉，千万别滑，让我顺利拿到那该死的衣服穿上。千万别让他看到我。

My hand edges closer to the fabric and my fingertips graze the soft material. I did it! I won! I begin to triumphantly grasp the material and then it happens. I feel myself lose balance. My hand around the duvet slips and I snatch at it to keep my modesty in check. My other hand however falls to the ground. I stifle a yelp as it hits the floor with a thud.  
我的手缓缓靠近那布料，指尖轻触柔软的材质。我做到了！我赢了！我开始得意地抓住那布料，然而就在这时，我失去了平衡。抓着被子的手滑了一下，我急忙抓住它以保持体面。但另一只手却落在了地上。我忍住了一声惊呼，它重重地砸在地板上。

I freeze in place as I hear Kaworu's footsteps, "Is everything okay?"  
我僵在原地，听到薰的脚步声，“一切都好吗？”

I quickly fire back, "Fine! I'm fine, breakfast smells great. Is it nearly ready?"  
我迅速回应道，“没事！我很好，早餐闻起来很香。快做好了吗？”

Please turn around, please turn around, please turn around.  
请转过身来，请转过身来，请转过身来。

"I'm just putting it out now. Will be a minute."  
“我现在就拿出来。稍等一下。”

I quickly glance and see he has turned his back, now is my opportunity. I grab the shirt from the floor and throw it on as quick as I can. I'm covered, I can face him now! I cast the duvet aside and brush the hair from my face and stand up. I still feel somewhat strange being in this state in front of Kaworu. I'm not used to exposing this much flesh to people but the nights are so warm I'm hardly going to wear my winter pyjama's  
我迅速瞥了一眼，发现他已经转过身去，现在正是机会。我从地板上抓起衬衫，以最快的速度穿上。我遮住了身体，现在可以面对他了！我掀开被子，拂去脸上的头发，站了起来。在这种状态下站在薰面前，我仍然感到有些不自在。我不习惯在别人面前露出这么多肌肤，但夜晚如此温暖，我总不能穿冬天的睡衣吧。

Still I am at least covered up where it counts. All he is going to see is most of my legs and he can't exactly see my chest unless he really makes an effort to look down my shirt. Something I'm fairly sure Kaworu won't be doing.  
至少在关键部位我还是遮住了的。他能看到的不过是我的大部分腿，除非他真的费劲去窥视我的衬衫下面，否则是看不到我的胸部的。我相当确信，碇不会这么做。

I walk over to the kitchen and stand beside the counter top with one of the plates on it. Kaworu just finishes placing the sausages on the plate and after putting the pan in the sink he turns to look at me. He starts off smiling but then I see a confused look spread across his face. I look at his eyes and they're not looking at my face, they're lower but not on the plates. They're focused on my chest, he wouldn't... be so obvious, would he?  
我走到厨房，站在操作台旁，上面放着几个盘子。碇刚刚把香肠摆放在盘子里，然后把平底锅放进水槽，转身看向我。他一开始微笑着，但随后我看到他脸上浮现出困惑的表情。我看着他的眼睛，它们并没有停留在我的脸上，而是更低的位置，但不是在盘子上。他的目光聚焦在我的胸部，他不会...这么明显吧，会吗？

"Kaworu... What are you staring at?" I start to raise my voice, ready to call him a pervert for being so obvious but then he looks back up at me.  
“碇...你在看什么？”我开始提高声音，准备骂他是个变态，因为他表现得如此明显，但他随即抬头看向我。

"N-Nothing it's just... Your top is..."  
"没、没什么，只是... 你的上衣..."

I look down and then I see the issue. I look back at Kaworu and my mouth opens and closes akin to a goldfish. In my haste to not get spotted I seem to have put my top on back to front, I'd feel less embarrassed if I did just flash my damn tits at him now. Our awkward silence goes on for a few moments longer.  
我低头一看，随即发现了问题所在。我抬头看向渚薰，嘴巴一张一合，活像条金鱼。匆忙之中，我似乎把上衣前后穿反了，现在要是直接露胸给他看，我可能还不会这么尴尬。我们之间的尴尬沉默又持续了几秒钟。

"Excuse me." I say politely as I excuse myself to go to the bathroom and correct my mistake. All the time resisting the urge to slam my foot against the wall.  
""失陪一下。"" 我礼貌地说道，然后借故去洗手间纠正错误。一路上我强忍着用脚踢墙的冲动。

The universe hates me. 这宇宙似乎对我充满了敌意。

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I feel those nerves build up in the pit of my stomach as I hold the phone in my hands and scroll to her name. I still haven't quite worked out what I'm going to say to her yet. I want to ask her about telling Shinji and Misato that she is alive and well. I do not know if I can do this though, I fear what her reaction will be.  
当我手中握着手机，滚动到她的名字时，我感到胃里一阵紧张。我还没完全想好要对她说些什么。我想问她关于告诉真嗣和美里她还活着的事。但我不知道自己能否做到，我害怕她的反应会是什么样。

I'm certain she'll be angry with me, she'll tell me that to do that would be betraying her and by wanting to do this I suppose I am betraying her. Asuka has been through so much pain in her life and she only made one request of me as a friend. It seemed like a simple promise to make and keep at first but now I am realizing that I cannot keep it any longer.  
我确信她会对我生气，她会说我这样做是在背叛她，而想要这么做，我确实是在背叛她。明日香经历了太多生活中的痛苦，她作为朋友只向我提了一个请求。起初，这似乎是一个简单且容易遵守的承诺，但现在我意识到我不能再遵守它了。

At the same time, I am hoping that maybe she will understand why it is I have to do this. With Nagisa reappearing as he has done it has complicated things and it has hurt Shinji. It has made me realize that by keeping this secret I too am hurting Shinji. All he wants to know is that Asuka is alright, I am sure that would help him.  
与此同时，我期待着或许她能理解我为何必须这么做。渚薰的再次出现让事情变得复杂，也让真嗣受到了伤害。这让我意识到，隐瞒这个秘密同样在伤害真嗣。他只想知道明日香是否安好，我相信这会对他有所帮助。

Perhaps if I told them that Asuka is alive and well but also tell her of her desire to stay away until she is ready they will understand. I do not think either would do something so drastic as to go and seek her out. With that said, that is what I did and Misato and Shinji have much more of an attachment to her than I did.  
也许如果我告诉他们明日香还活着且安然无恙，同时也告诉她希望保持距离直到她准备好，他们会理解。我不认为他们中的任何一个会采取如此极端的行动去找她。尽管如此，这正是我所做的，而美里和真嗣与她的羁绊远比我深。

My other fear is as to how Shinji will react. I have been keeping this secret from him for nearly three years, I could have told him at any time and I didn't. I knew all along of the feelings he had for her and the feelings she had for him. I have kept them apart from one another when I could have done so much more. Will my brother be angry with me? Will he hate me for what I have done?  
我另一个担忧是真嗣会如何反应。我对他隐瞒这个秘密近三年，本可以在任何时候告诉他，但我没有。我一直知道他对她的感情以及她对他的感情。我让他们彼此分离，而本可以做更多。我的弟弟会生我的气吗？他会因为我所做的事而恨我吗？

I let out a sigh as my thumb finally presses the call button and the phone starts to dial Germany. A few moments later she answers and I hear a surprisingly happy voice, _"Hallo! Rei, I didn't expect to hear from you, how are you doing?"_  
我叹了口气，终于用拇指按下了呼叫键，电话开始拨打德国。片刻后她接听了，我听到一个出乎意料的欢快声音：“哈喽！丽，没想到会接到你的电话，你还好吗？”

"I am doing well, thank you. How are you?"  
“我很好，谢谢。你呢？”

_"I'm good." “我也不错。”_

I'm about to say something else to her but then I hear something in the background. At first, I think it could be that Asuka has left her television on and I'm hearing whatever show it is she has on. A second later I hear Asuka speak, _"I'll be back in a few moments, I'm just going to take this phone call."_  
我正要对她再说些什么，但这时我听到了背景中的声音。起初，我以为可能是明日香忘了关电视，我听到的是她正在看的节目。过了一会儿，我听到明日香说话，“我一会儿就回来，现在先接个电话。”

There is the sound of movement from the other end of the phone, followed by the sounds of a door closing, _"Sorry about that!"_  
电话那头传来一阵移动的声音，接着是关门声，“抱歉让你久等了！”

I pause for a moment to think about the reason for my phonecall. Asuka has someone there with her, I did not expect that to have happened. Perhaps now is not the best time for this. I should maybe have expected this to happen. Asuka is busy at the moment finishing her second book, I expect she must have things to do and meetings with others.  
我停顿片刻，思考着打电话的原因。明日香身边有人，这是我没预料到的。也许现在不是谈这个的最佳时机。我或许应该预见到这种情况。明日香正忙于完成她的第二本书，我想她肯定有很多事情要做，还要与其他人会面。

"No, I apologize. I did not realize you had company. If I did I would not have called you. I can call you back if it is important."  
"不，我道歉。我没意识到你有客人。如果知道的话，我就不会打电话给你了。如果事情重要，我可以稍后再打给你。"

_"Not at all! It's not important, I'm just... with a friend and we're playing some games together, that's all!"  
"一点儿也不！不重要，我只是……和朋友在一起，我们正在一起玩游戏，就这样！"_

It is a... friend? I feel a small pang of jealousy at hearing that but I quickly force it away. I did not realize Asuka had other friends in Germany, she does not speak of knowing anyone else there and yet it does make sense. She has been there for a few years.  
是个……朋友？听到这个我感到一丝嫉妒，但我很快把它压了下去。我不知道明日香在德国还有其他朋友，她从未提起过在那儿认识任何人，不过这确实说得通。她已经在那里待了几年了。

It seems that my decision has been made for me, I will not speak to Asuka about that matter at this moment in time. I would not wish to upset her when she is with others. Instead I'm about to ask her how her week has been when she speaks.  
看来我的决定已不由我掌控，此刻我不会与明日香谈论那件事。我不希望她在他人面前感到不安。正当我准备问她这周过得如何时，她开口了。

_"Actually... Rei, I was going to call you later."_ She lets out a sigh, _"There is something I wanted to talk to you about."_  
“实际上……丽，我本打算稍后给你打电话。”她叹了口气，“有件事我想和你谈谈。”

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, it is unlike Asuka to reach out to me to talk about something. Usually I have to pry things out of her. I sit down on the edge of my bed, "You can talk to me about anything, you know that."  
出于好奇，我挑了挑眉，明日香主动找我谈事情可不常见。通常我得费劲从她那里套话。我坐在床边，“你可以和我谈任何事，你知道的。”

"I know but I think... you might be angry at me for this." She pauses again, "The Friday after you left to go back to Japan... I... I visited Nagisa."  
"我知道，但我想... 你可能会因此生我的气。" 她再次停顿，"你回日本后的那个周五... 我... 我去了渚那里。"

I was certainly not prepared to hear those words from her. I try to not make any sound but feel my hand clench itself into a fist, my nails digging into my palm. I try to not be angry with her, I try to not be angry because I am sure there is a reasonable explanation.  
听到她这些话，我确实毫无准备。我努力不发出任何声音，但感觉到自己的手紧握成拳，指甲深深陷入掌心。我试图不生她的气，试图不生气，因为我确信有合理的解释。

I just do not understand how, after all my warnings, after all I told her about just who and what Nagisa was! How could she have just ignored me like that. It seems so typical of her, so foolish of her, why would she do such a thing?  
我就是不明白，在我多次警告她，在我告诉她渚是谁、是什么样的人之后！她怎么能就这样无视我。这似乎太典型了，太愚蠢了，她为什么要做这样的事？

She couldn't have even known that he was human when she made that decision. She must have known the risk she was putting herself in.  
她做出那个决定时，甚至可能不知道他是人类。她一定知道自己所冒的风险。

_"You're mad at me, aren't you?"_ Asuka asks me.  
"你在生我的气，对吧？" 明日香问我。

"No!" I reply bluntly not doing a very good job of hiding my anger.  
"没有！" 我直截了当地回答，没能很好地掩饰我的愤怒。

_"Heh."_ Asuka laughs, _"You know... I don't blame you, considering who he is and what you told me you have every reason to be."_  
"呵呵。" 明日香笑道，"你知道的……我不怪你，考虑到他的身份和你告诉我的那些事，你有充分的理由这么做。"

"Why did you visit him?" I ask her, "I warned you about him and what he was. I do not understand why you would put yourself at risk like that."  
"你为什么要去看他？" 我问她，"我警告过你关于他的事。我不明白你为何要冒这样的险。"

_"Because I'm Asuka Langley Soryu of course!"_ She replies in a mocking tone, _"Because I can handle myself and take care of myself. Because I've never been good at taking advice that is good for me and... I was curious about him. I saw him run away from me Rei, I had to know why he was terrified of me and I had to know what he was for myself. I had to... You know what, I don't know the full reason myself, I just did!"_  
"因为我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷当然！" 她用嘲讽的语气回答，"因为我能照顾好自己。因为我从不擅长接受对我有益的建议，而且……我对他的好奇心驱使着我。我看到他逃离我，丽，我必须知道他为何害怕我，我必须亲自了解他是什么样的人。我必须……你知道吗，我自己也不完全清楚原因，我就是这么做了！"

As she says these things my brain makes a sudden yet bizarre leap. That voice I heard previously, the male friend she has over. It could not be... could it? He couldn't possibly be there right now, could he? Such an event seems... inconceivable. I can understand her need to satiate her curiosity but further interaction with Nagisa would be a move ill-fitting my friend.  
当她说这些话时，我的思绪突然跳跃到了一个奇怪的地方。之前我听到的那个声音，她提到的那个男性朋友。不可能是...吧？他现在不可能在那里，对吧？这样的事情似乎...难以置信。我能理解她满足好奇心的需要，但与渚进一步接触对我朋友来说并不合适。

"What did you find out?" I ask her, no longer making an attempt to hide my annoyance.  
“你发现了什么？”我问她，不再掩饰我的不悦。

_"I found out he's terrified Rei, he's scared of everything. He was terrified of me and he barely even knew who I was. I was nothing more than a name on a file he had read and yet he was terrified of me."  
“我发现他很害怕怜，他对一切都感到恐惧。他对我感到害怕，他几乎不认识我。我只是他读过的档案上的一个名字，而他却对我感到害怕。”_

"Good, he has every reason to be afraid of you." I reply, "Especially now that he is human, he knows people can hurt him."  
"很好，他有充分的理由害怕你。" 我回答，"特别是现在他变成了人类，他知道人们可以伤害他。"

_"You knew about that?" "你知道这件事？"_

"Misato spoke to Fuyutsuki about him reappearing. We found out when Nagisa returned and why he is in Germany."  
"美里和冬月谈过他再次出现的事。我们是在渚回来后才知道他在德国的原因。"

_"Yeah... Fuyutsuki helped him out... Does... Well does your brother know about him?"  
"是啊...冬月老师帮了他...那...呃，你哥哥知道他吗？"_

My mind goes back to my earlier conversation with Shinji and his reaction to Kaworu's return. Shinji seems to be alright now. I heard him playing the cello earlier and he seemed to be happy during dinner. I will check on him after this phone call.  
我的思绪回到了之前与真嗣的对话以及他对渚薰归来的反应。真嗣现在似乎没事了。我之前听到他在拉大提琴，晚餐时他看起来也很开心。这通电话结束后我会去看看他。

"I told him earlier today."  
"今天早些时候我告诉他了。"

_"I see, how... did he take it?"  
"我明白了，他...是怎么接受这件事的？"_

"He took it hard." I'm honest with her, "What happened with Nagisa hurt him badly, not just because of what Nagisa did but because of what Shinji was forced to do. You remember I told you about that?"  
"他很难过。" 我诚实地告诉她，"渚的事情对他打击很大，不仅仅是因为渚做了什么，还因为真嗣被迫做了什么。你记得我跟你提过吗？"

_"Yes... He had to kill Nagisa I..."  
"是的... 他不得不杀了渚，我..."_

"I will protect Shinji from Nagisa, I do not wish to see my brother hurt like that again."  
"我会保护真嗣不受渚的伤害，我不希望再看到我的弟弟那样受伤。"

_"I understand Rei it's just... I don't think... Nagisa is as you think he's... terrified of the world and barely knows how to live he..."  
"我理解你，丽，只是...我不认为...渚像你想的那样...他对这个世界感到恐惧，几乎不知道如何生活..."_

She pauses as she tries to search for the right words, finally she speaks again, "He's not that different to us Rei."  
她停顿了一下，试图寻找合适的词句，最终再次开口，"他并不比我们更不同，丽。"

On hearing her say that I feel my anger rise in my chest. How can Asuka say such a thing to me when she knows, she knows exactly what Nagisa did to my brother? She knows what Shinji went through and she knows what Kaworu did. How can she think that Nagisa is in any way similar to any of us?  
听到她这么说，我感到胸中的怒火升腾。阿斯卡怎么能对我说这样的话，她明明知道，她完全清楚渚对我哥哥做了什么？她知道真嗣经历了什么，也知道薰做了什么。她怎么还能认为渚和我们中的任何一个有相似之处呢？

"Nagisa is very different to us!" I reply, "He was aware of what he was and what he was doing. He could have stopped himself, it was all within his power. If he has told you otherwise it is a lie Asuka! He is the enemy."  
“渚和我们完全不同！”我反驳道，“他清楚自己是谁，也清楚自己在做什么。他本可以阻止自己，这一切都在他的掌控之中。如果他对你说了别的，那是谎言，阿斯卡！他是敌人。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I hear Rei raise her voice at me down the phone and all I can do is stare at it in quiet amazement. A part of me wants to laugh at hearing an irate Rei Ayanami. I don't laugh though because this isn't a laughing matter. I feel a queasiness in my stomach as I wonder how I'm going to explain the rest of what has happened regarding Kaworu to Rei. I don't even know if I can or should, Rei is so protective of her brother and any threat to him.  
我听到电话那头丽提高了声音，我只能静静地盯着它，心中满是惊讶。有一部分我想笑，听到生气的丽·绫波让我觉得好笑。但我没有笑，因为这不是笑的时候。我感到胃里一阵恶心，不知道该如何向丽解释关于薰的其他事情。我甚至不知道我是否能或者应该这样做，丽对她哥哥的保护欲太强，任何对他构成威胁的事情都让她紧张。

It is difficult to blame her for that though, after the things that I put him through and the pain and suffering inflicted on him by others in his life she has to be. Not only that but she feels she owes her current life and happiness to him. I don't blame her for seeing Kaworu as a threat and someone who would hurt Shinji.  
尽管如此，要责怪她确实很难，毕竟我让他经历的那些事，以及他一生中其他人施加给他的痛苦和折磨，她不得不如此。不仅如此，她还觉得她现在的生活和幸福都归功于他。我不怪她把渚薰视为威胁，认为他会伤害真嗣。

I know the things Kaworu did were wrong but the difference is I've actually spoken to him and Rei hasn't. I've listened to him tell me about his upbringing and what he was made to believe under SEELE. Yes, Kaworu did bad things but we all did bad things back then and we're all paying for it now. I know that more than anyone else.  
我知道渚薰所做的事是错误的，但不同的是，我实际上和他交谈过，而绫波没有。我听他讲述了他的成长经历以及他在 Seele 下被迫相信的东西。是的，渚薰做了坏事，但我们那时都做了坏事，现在我们都在为此付出代价。我比任何人都清楚这一点。

I do feel like telling her this now was a mistake. She's probably had a rough ride dealing with her brother and it isn't exactly easy to hold this conversation with Kaworu sat in the other room but I feel she deserves to know. If I'm going to be Kaworu's friend then I need to tell her that and try to get her to give him a chance.  
我现在确实觉得告诉她这些是个错误。她可能一直在艰难地处理她哥哥的事情，而且当渚薰坐在另一个房间时，进行这样的对话并不容易，但我觉得她有权知道。如果我要成为渚薰的朋友，那么我需要告诉她这一点，并试图让她给他一个机会。

The truth is I need her to be my best friend through this too because I'm finding the more time I spend with him the more I'm starting to have other feelings too. It's only been two weeks since I've met him but being around him just… makes me smile, it makes me happy and I feel comfortable around him.  
事实是我也需要她在这段时间里成为我最好的朋友，因为我发现随着与他相处的时间增多，我开始产生其他感情了。自从遇见他才不过两周，但待在他身边……让我微笑，让我感到快乐，也让我觉得自在。

Also… I do find him attractive. His eyes show so much emotion and I feel like I could get lost staring into them. He has a cute little smile when he laughs and the look on his face when he played piano, the way his fingers glided across the piano keys was wonderful.  
而且……我确实觉得他很有魅力。他的眼睛流露出如此丰富的情感，我仿佛能迷失在那深邃的凝视中。他笑起来时那可爱的微笑，还有他弹钢琴时脸上的表情，手指在琴键上流畅滑动的样子，真是美妙极了。

I shake my head trying to stop those thoughts for a moment, I need to deal with the friendship thing first.  
我摇摇头，试图暂时停止这些思绪，我需要先处理好友谊这一层关系。

"Look Rei, I… I know you don't like him and I don't blame you. Those things you said about him though, about him not being trustworthy and him hurting others, him being away of what he was doing? He could have stopped at any time? Rei… Take away the part about him being an Angel and who does that sound like?"  
"看，丽，我……我知道你不喜欢他，我不怪你。但你说的那些关于他的话，说他不可信，伤害别人，明知故犯？他本可以随时停手的？丽……去掉他是天使的部分，这听起来像谁呢？"

I hear Rei sigh in annoyance, _"That is completely different Asuka, you were-"_  
我听到丽不耐烦地叹气，“那完全不同，明日香，你曾经——”

"I was a traumatized teen with a fucked up childhood. I had a father who couldn't give a shit about me and a step-mother who tried but I didn't want to know. I grew up believing I was better than everyone else and I was horrible to you all. I lashed out at everyone, it didn't matter who it was, you… Misato and yes… your brother most of all. I was a horrible person Rei. If people know the truth about me… what do you think they would say?"  
"我曾经是一个受过创伤的青少年，有着糟糕的童年。我有一个根本不在乎我的父亲和一个试图关心我却让我不想理会的继母。我从小认为自己高人一等，对你们都很恶劣。我向所有人发泄，不管对方是谁，你……美里，还有，尤其是你哥哥。我是个很糟糕的人，丽。如果人们知道我的真相……你觉得他们会说什么？"

She pauses again, _"I understand what you are saying yet I do not see how his situation mirrors yours. Besides you have already expressed guilt for your situation and we know why you acted in such a way. You have apologized for it."_  
她再次停顿，“我明白你的意思，但我看不出他的处境如何与你相似。况且，你已经为自己的行为表达了愧疚，我们知道你为何会那样做。你已经为此道歉了。”

"So has he Rei, he feels horrible about what he was and what he did, he apologized to me and to the people in the facility. I spoke to him, I found out about what sort of childhood he had, SEELE raised him just so that he could die. They kept him isolated from the outside world and told him nothing but how bad humans were."  
“丽，他也一样，他对自己曾经的样子和所做的事感到非常痛苦，他向我以及设施里的人们道了歉。我和他谈过，我了解到他有着怎样的童年，SEELE 培养他只是为了让他去死。他们让他与外界隔绝，只告诉他人类有多么恶劣。”

_"That is… unfortunate. I… was unaware of any of this, you have remained in contact with him then?"  
“那真是……不幸。我……对此一无所知，你一直和他保持联系吗？”_

"Yes… Rei… I spent the night at his apartment last night."  
"是的……丽……我昨晚在他公寓过夜了。"

_"You what? I did not think you were inte-"_ Her voice gets higher and I can only imagine what is running through her mind.  
"你说什么？我没想到你会……"她的声音越来越高，我只能想象她脑海中闪过的念头。"

"Not like that!" I hastily stop her, "I got a phonecall yesterday from Fuyutsuki… Kaworu had been attacked, the people who were supposed to protect him got him outside his apartment. I was Kaworu's only friend so I spent the night here and looked after him. He needed a friend Rei… But… I had to tell you because you deserve to know about him too."  
"不是那样的！"我急忙打断她，"昨天我从冬月那里接到电话……渚薰遭到了袭击，那些本该保护他的人却让他离开了公寓。我是渚薰唯一的朋友，所以我在这里过夜并照顾他。他需要一个朋友，丽……但是……我必须告诉你，因为你也应该了解他的情况。"

There is another long pause, _"Was he hurt badly?"_  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，“他伤得很重吗？”

"They bust his nose, gave him a black eye and kicked every other part of him. Nothing was broken but it didn't help his fear of people."  
“他们打断了他的鼻子，打青了他的眼睛，还踢遍了他全身。虽然没骨折，但这加剧了他对人的恐惧。”

_"I see. I am… Sorry for what has happened to him then, if he is as you say than he does not deserve that. I… I apologize that I cannot yet feel good about this situation, there are things I need to figure out."  
“我明白了。那么，对于他所遭遇的一切，我感到很抱歉。如果他真如你所说，那他确实不该遭受这些。我……我为我还不能对这种情况感到释怀而道歉，我需要弄清楚一些事情。”_

"I know." I reply, "I just… He seems like a victim too in this and he shouldn't be alone."  
"我知道。" 我回答，"我只是……在这件事中，他也像是受害者，他不应该独自一人。"

I hear what sounds like a small chuckle from the other end of the phone, _"This is proof then, that you are not the bad person that you think you are Asuka."_  
我听到电话那头传来一声轻微的轻笑，"这就是证明，你并不是你自己认为的那种坏人，明日香。"

I feel myself blush, "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"  
我感到自己脸红了，"那到底是什么意思？"

_"That you constantly berate yourself and tell me you are not a good person, yet you are looking after this person you have no reason to like or trust. You… saw past that which others such as myself cannot yet see past. You are a good person."  
"你总是自我批评，告诉我你不是个好人，然而你却在照顾一个你没有理由喜欢或信任的人。你……看到了那些像我这样的人还未能看透的东西。你是个好人。"_

"I'm just trying to help him."  
"我只是想帮他。"

_"I know and I apologize again that I cannot feel good about this but perhaps with more time and when I am certain he will not hurt anyone I may do so. I would like you to look after him though and Asuka…"  
"我知道，再次为我的不安道歉，但也许随着时间的推移，当我确信他不会伤害任何人时，我会感觉好些。不过，我希望你能继续照顾他，还有……明日香……"_

"Yes?" “是？”

_"If he does hurt you… I will be in Germany to hunt him down."  
"如果他真的伤害了你……我会去德国把他找出来。"_

I can't help but laugh but also feel slightly afraid that perhaps Rei isn't joking. Before I say my goodbye I realize there is something I want to say to Rei, "Rei… before I go I… I have no right to ask you to do this and no right to say his name but please… I know how much he must be hurting right now and he needs people so… Look after Shinji."  
我不禁笑出声来，但也有些害怕，或许丽并不是在开玩笑。在我告别之前，我意识到有些话想对丽说，“丽……在我离开之前……我没有权利要求你这么做，也没有权利提起他的名字，但请……我知道他现在一定很痛苦，他需要人陪伴……照顾好真嗣。”

### Chapter 6: Telephone Line  
第六章：电话线  

**6th September 2021 2021 年 9 月 6 日**

**Asuka Langley Soryu – Berlin  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 – 柏林**

**Early morning. 清晨时分。**

I open the door into my apartment step straight through into the living room, on looking around I can see it's exactly the same as it was when I left it on Friday evening. The same dirty plates have been left out on the coffee table, one of my controllers has been left on the sofa along with my laptop, the entire place looks... lived in and yet as I push the laptop and controller aside it feels remarkably empty.  
我推开公寓的门，直接走进客厅，环顾四周，一切如旧，和我周五晚上离开时一模一样。咖啡桌上还散落着脏盘子，沙发上遗留着我的一个游戏手柄和笔记本电脑，整个地方看起来……充满了生活气息，然而当我把笔记本和手柄推到一旁时，却感到异常空荡。

There was actually a part of me that didn't want to come back to this place after the weekend. That small part of me wanted to stay at Kaworu's place but I had work to do here. Besides which Kaworu also had to return to work, Fuyutsuki did offer him the week off due to the attack but Kaworu insisted on going back in. I can't say I blame him for that, I'd have been the same.  
实际上，有一部分的我并不想在周末后回到这个地方。那小小的一部分我渴望留在渚薰那里，但我在这里还有工作要做。况且，渚薰也得回去上班，尽管冬月教授因袭击事件给了他一周假期，渚薰却坚持要回去。我不能说他这样做有什么错，换作我也会一样。

I suppose I'll at least be thankful for being back in my own bed tonight. Kaworu's sofa was comfortable but I don't think I'd be able to handle too many nights on it. I suppose there is always his... No, I can't think that sort of thing. I mustn't think that, I can't let myself think of feel those sorts of things.  
我想今晚至少能感激自己回到了自己的床上。Kaworu 的沙发虽然舒适，但我觉得自己无法承受太多夜晚睡在上面。我想总有他的...不，我不能那样想。我绝不能那样想，我不能让自己想到或感受到那些事情。

That is another reason as to why I had to return. Over the course of yesterday and even this morning I've been having slightly more thoughts about Kaworu in certain ways. I had to get away from there because I can't allow myself to feel those things for him, befriending him was an accident but I can't let that go too far. He'll just end up being hurt.  
这也是我必须回来的另一个原因。昨天一整天甚至到今天早上，我对 Kaworu 的某些想法变得稍微多了一些。我必须离开那里，因为我不能让自己对他产生那种感情，与他成为朋友是个意外，但我不能让这走得太远。他最终只会受到伤害。

Yet, every time I try to remind myself of that the thoughts become more intrusive and vivid. They start off innocent enough. We might be sitting on the sofa and playing a game together but then we'll be holding hands or holding one another. Strangely it always seems to be Kaworu who is cuddling into me and not the other way around, I suppose even in my fantasies I have to be the dominant one.  
然而，每次我试图提醒自己这一点时，这些想法变得更加侵入性和生动。它们开始时足够无辜。我们可能坐在沙发上一起玩游戏，但随后我们会牵手或拥抱彼此。奇怪的是，似乎总是 Kaworu 依偎在我身边，而不是相反，我想即使在幻想中，我也必须是主导的那一个。

Today those thoughts shifted again. We weren't holding each other on the sofa but in his bed. We weren't just cuddling but we were kissing as well, passionately and deeply. I could feel him, I could feel all of him. It made my bus ride home very uncomfortable.  
今天，这些想法再次转变。我们不再是在沙发上相拥，而是在他的床上。我们不仅仅是依偎，还在深情而热烈地亲吻。我能感受到他，感受到他的全部。这让我的回家路程变得非常尴尬。

I keep on trying to tell myself that it means absolutely nothing, my mind is just working overtime because of the strange situation I find myself in. It's affect anyone if an attractive stranger like Kaworu suddenly came into your life in such a way. Here is this person who I know nothing about yet shares a history with me and my past. He enjoys and can play the music I also like, he is well spoken and very handsome. Yet he also needs help and is similar to me in many ways, of course that is going to affect me.  
我不断试图告诉自己，这根本不代表什么，只是因为身处这种奇怪的境地，我的大脑才过度运转。如果像渚薰这样的迷人陌生人突然以这种方式进入你的生活，任何人都会受到影响。这个人，我对他一无所知，却与我共享一段历史和过去。他喜欢并能演奏我也喜欢的音乐，他谈吐得体，非常英俊。然而，他也需要帮助，在很多方面与我相似，当然这会影响到我。

The time we spent together has hardly been normal either. Who would blame me for the first meeting? I was curious and wanted to know more about him. I wanted to know how someone could have upset Rei so much and why he was scared of me. This weekend I was just being a good friend. He had been hurt by the people who promised to protect him, how could I not be there for him. So, all in all my mind acting the way it does makes sense.  
我们在一起度过的时光也几乎不正常。谁会怪我第一次见面呢？我那时好奇，想更多地了解他。我想知道是什么样的人能让丽如此不安，又为何对我感到害怕。这个周末我只是想做个好朋友。他曾被那些承诺保护他的人伤害过，我怎能不在他身边。所以，总的来说，我的思维方式是有道理的。

Besides I barely know the guy, I can't have any feelings for someone I barely know. He doesn't even know me yet, if he did then he would have continued to run from me. If he knew me then he'd know that I can't offer him anything good friendship or otherwise, all I can offer is myself, and I'm not worth anything.  
再说了，我几乎不了解这个人，我不可能对一个几乎不认识的人有感情。他甚至还不了解我，如果他了解我，他就会继续逃避我。如果他了解我，他就会知道我无法给他任何除了友谊之外的好处，我能提供的只有我自己，而我一文不值。

The dream I had last night hasn't helped either. It involved Kaworu and Shinji again. It was not the same as the first one, I didn't witness them together without me but instead I was with the two of them. It was early morning I think and we were all lying in a bed together. I had one on either side of me and we were all so warm and happy. It was strange but it felt like the three of us were pieces that completed some bizarre puzzle.  
昨晚的梦也没有帮助。梦里又出现了薰和真嗣。和第一个梦不一样，我没有目睹他们在一起而我在场外，而是我和他们两人在一起。我想是清晨时分，我们三个人躺在一张床上。我两边各有一个，我们都很温暖和快乐。这很奇怪，但感觉我们三个像是完成了某个奇怪拼图的碎片。

It's been a very long time since I've thought of Shinji in such a way. I never stopped having feelings for him after I left Japan but I tried to suppress them. It's why I went so long without uttering his name. That's changed now, I said his name to Rei and the floodgates are now open once again. Shinji... Shinji... Shinji, Shinji, Shinji... Stupid idiot Shinji!  
已经很久没有以这种方式想起过真嗣了。自从离开日本后，我对他的感情从未停止，但我试图压抑它们。这就是为什么我这么久没有提起他的名字。现在情况变了，我对绫波提到了他的名字，那些情感的闸门再次被打开。真嗣...真嗣...真嗣，真嗣，真嗣...愚蠢的真嗣！

I can't help the sad smile that comes to my lips as my mind wanders to the image of Shinji. Rei has told him that Kaworu is alive now, I imagine he'll have taken the news about it hard. Rei will take care of him though. Rei knows what to do, she's come a hell of a long way from the girl she used to be. The girl that I berated and called a doll.  
我不禁露出一丝苦笑，思绪飘向真嗣的影像。绫波已经告诉他薰还活着的消息，我想他听到这个消息会很难过。不过绫波会照顾他的。绫波知道该怎么做，她已经从一个我曾斥责并称之为玩偶的女孩走了很远。

I wonder what they're doing right now, I wonder what he is doing right now. Rei mentioned he is playing the cello again, I wonder if he is playing that now? I wonder what he sounds like on it. When I heard him many years ago I really liked what I heard, I know little of how to play an instrument, it's the one thing my brilliant self never got around to trying. I was focused on my studies and my Eva piloting, maybe I should take up an instrument one day.  
我不知道他们现在在做什么，我不知道他现在在做什么。绫波提到他又开始拉大提琴了，我不知道他现在是不是在拉？我想知道他在大提琴上的声音是什么样的。多年前我听过他的演奏，我真的很喜欢，我对乐器演奏知之甚少，这是我聪明绝顶的自己从未尝试过的事情。我专注于我的学习和 Eva 驾驶，也许有一天我应该学一门乐器。

I'd like to hear Shinji play. I should ask Rei to record him playing for me so I can hear it. I know she'll disapprove of it or… maybe I should just reach out to him myself. Maybe I should just let him know I'm alive and well. I know I have to do it eventually, I can't let Rei keep that secret forever but I don't know if I'm ready.  
我想听听真嗣的演奏。我应该让绫波帮我录下他弹琴的样子，这样我就能听到了。我知道她会反对，或者……也许我应该直接联系他。也许我应该让他知道我还活着，而且很好。我知道我迟早得这么做，我不能让绫波永远保守这个秘密，但我不知道自己是否准备好了。

No… It's not that I'm not ready, it's that I'm scared. Scared of hurting him again but so damn scared of being hurt. Scared that he'll have smartened up and seen who I really was. He'll tell me the truth about myself. Tell me that I'm a horrible person and that he hates me. Tell me how much I hurt him and that he doesn't want any part of me in his life.  
不……不是我没准备好，而是我害怕。害怕再次伤害他，但也害怕被伤害。害怕他已经变得聪明，看清了我的真面目。他会告诉我关于我自己的真相。告诉我我是个可怕的人，他恨我。告诉我我伤他有多深，他不想再和我有任何瓜葛。

Or maybe that wouldn't happen. Maybe it's just like Rei says and I'm not as horrible a person as I think I am. Maybe I can actually be friends with Shinji and Kaworu and not have to feel this goddamn guilt so much. This is why I didn't want to be alone, because with Kaworu I could actually forget about it. I could make him my focus and I didn't have to remember me for a change.  
或者也许那不会发生。也许就像绫波说的，我并没有自己想象的那么糟糕。也许我真的能和真嗣、渚薰成为朋友，不再那么强烈地感到内疚。这就是为什么我不想独自一人，因为和渚薰在一起，我才能真正忘记这些。我可以让他成为我的焦点，不用再一直想着自己。

I can't keep doing that though can I? I can't just use Kaworu to prop myself up. Next time we meet there won't be anything else behind it, no curiosity and no attack from others. It'll be on our own terms but I don't know if I can reach out to him. I'd like to see him again, I like being around him. I like talking to him about music and hearing what his plans are. We can play games together and just laugh and enjoy ourselves.  
我不能再这样下去了，对吧？我不能总是依赖渚薰来支撑自己。下次我们见面时，背后不会再有任何其他东西，没有好奇心，也没有他人的攻击。一切都将由我们自己决定，但我不知道我是否能向他伸出手。我想再见他一面，我喜欢和他在一起的感觉。我喜欢和他谈论音乐，听他的计划。我们可以一起玩游戏，尽情欢笑，享受彼此的陪伴。

I'd like to continue being friends with him, I want to be friends with him. I want to be friends with Shinji again. Maybe we could all meet up together and get everything out. We can all scream and yell and cry at one another until we have nothing left. Maybe we could even… I shake my head, my minds wandered to that place again. I don't know why I'm feeling so wound up, I'm not normally… I mean I do imagine things but I never usually feel like this. Then again I haven't in a while, maybe I need to take care of it. I need a bath… a nice long hot bath to empty my mind of these thoughts.  
我想继续和他做朋友，我想和他成为朋友。我也想再次和真嗣成为朋友。也许我们可以一起聚聚，把所有事情都说开。我们可以互相尖叫、大喊、哭泣，直到再也没有什么可说的。也许我们甚至可以……我摇了摇头，思绪又飘到了那个地方。我不知道为什么我会感到如此紧张，我平时不是这样的……我是说，我确实会想象一些事情，但我通常不会像这样。不过，我已经有一段时间没有这样了，也许我需要处理一下。我需要泡个澡……一个舒适的热水澡，让这些思绪从我的脑海中消失。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**  
**Tokyo-2 第二东京**

I approach the store and take a deep breath to calm my nerves, I can already hear the voice inside my head telling me how silly it is to be nervous about this.  
我走向商店，深吸一口气以平复紧张的情绪，脑海中已经响起那个声音，嘲笑我为这点小事紧张有多傻。

_'What are you? Stupid. They don't know who you are, they've never heard of you! Why are you scared of them? Just go in there and get it done!'  
“你这是怎么了？傻了吗。他们根本不认识你，也没听说过你！你怕他们什么？直接进去，把事情办了！”_

I nearly laugh and shake my head, it's funny how the voice in my head who tries to push me to do something will take her form. I know it's right as well, I know I have nothing to fear by going into the store. I grab a basket and pull out my list. I move into the store and try to ignore the feeling that the people are looking at me, that they know who I am and are going to say something to me.  
我差点笑出声来，摇了摇头，真有趣，那个总试图推动我去做些什么的内心声音，竟然会以她的形象出现。我也知道她说得对，我知道进店没什么好怕的。我拿起一个篮子，掏出清单。走进店里，努力忽略那种感觉——人们都在盯着我，他们知道我是谁，随时会对我评头论足。

I brush past them and move to get the first items on my list. I move into the vegetable aisle and start looking at the ones I need. I take my time examining each one trying to find the ones that are the best quality. When I'm satisfied with them I place them into the basket. I look down at the next thing I need when I hear a familiar voice calling out my name.  
我擦身而过，走向清单上的第一项物品。我走进蔬菜区，开始寻找我需要的那些。我仔细检查每一个，试图找到品质最好的。当我满意后，便将它们放入篮子。我低头看向下一项需要的东西，这时听到一个熟悉的声音在呼唤我的名字。

"Hey Shinji!" “嘿，真嗣！”

My first instinct is to panic but instead I look up to see a smiling Hikari waving at me. I smile and wave back and move towards her, "Hikari!"  
我的第一反应是慌张，但我抬头看到微笑着向我挥手的光，我也笑了，挥手回应，“光！”

She bows her head politely towards me, "How are you doing?"  
她礼貌地向我低头致意，“你好吗？”

"I'm going well." I reply to her as I pull a box of eggs down from the shelf. I open the lid to check the contents for any damage before setting them into the basket, "Are you and Touji okay?"  
“我很好。”我一边回答她，一边从架子上取下一盒鸡蛋。我打开盖子检查内容物是否有损坏，然后才将其放入篮中，“你和东治还好吗？”

She nods, "Fine, Toji has a coaching session today. Don't tell him I told you this but I reckon he was a bit nervous about it."  
她点点头，“很好，东治今天有个教练课。别告诉他我跟你说了这个，但我觉得他有点紧张。”

"Oh really! That's great!" I smile as she tells me the news, Toji since returning has been working towards becoming a PE teacher. It's quite a turnaround for someone like Toji who never really shown any interest in school but he really wants to do it.  
"哦，真的！那太好了！" 她告诉我这个消息时，我笑着说。东治自从回来后一直在努力成为一名体育老师。对于像东治这样从未真正对学校表现出兴趣的人来说，这真是一个巨大的转变，但他真的很想这么做。

"It is, I heard you're taking cello lessons too!"  
"确实，我听说你也在上大提琴课！"

I nod, "Y-Yeah! I have another lesson this afternoon actually."  
我点头，"嗯，是的！实际上今天下午我还有一节课。"

I feel myself tense up when I remember my lesson this afternoon. Today is the day that I was going to give me answer about joining up with the group. I still don't know what I'm going to do. With all that has happened I never got a chance to discuss it with Rei and then the news about Kaworu pushed it out of my mind. Damnit, I'm such an idiot!  
每当回想起今天下午的课程，我就感到自己紧张起来。今天是我要给出是否加入团队的答复的日子。我仍然不知道该怎么做。发生了这么多事，我从未有机会和丽讨论过，然后关于薰的消息又让我把这事抛诸脑后。该死，我真是个白痴！

Hikari seems to notice my sudden discomfort, "Is everything okay?"  
光似乎注意到了我的突然不适，“一切都好吗？”

"Y-Yeah I just… I forgot that I was supposed to do something today and I still don't know if I can do it." I reply.  
“嗯——嗯，我只是……我忘了今天我应该做某件事，而且我仍然不确定我能否做到。”我回答道。

"Is this about that group thing?"  
"这是关于那个小组活动的事吗？"

I nod, "Y-You knew about that?"  
我点头，"Y-你已经知道了吗？"

"Toji told me about it when he said you were taking lessons. So you haven't made a decision on it yet?"  
"东治告诉我这件事的时候，他说你在上课程。那么你还没决定要不要参加吗？"

I shake my head, "No… Not yet, I don't know what I should do."  
我摇摇头，“不……还没有，我不知道我该做什么。”

"Well, have you talked to other people?"  
“那么，你和其他人谈过了吗？”

"I spoke to Misato and Rei briefly… I spoke to Toji and Kensuke and…"  
“我和美里、绫波简短地谈过……我和真治、健介也谈过……”

"They just told you to do what you wanted to do right?"  
"他们只是让你做你想做的事，对吧？"

I nod, "Yeah… Problem is I don't know what I want to do. I just don't want to let people down I suppose."  
我点点头，"是啊……问题是，我不知道自己想做什么。我想，我只是不想让人失望。"

"I don't think there is any danger of you doing that but… I can see how people just saying do what you want won't help." She says as she smiles at me, "Do you like the idea of playing cello with others?"  
"我觉得你不会让人失望的，不过……我明白别人说‘做你想做的’这种话帮不上忙。"" 她笑着对我说，""你喜欢和其他人一起拉大提琴的想法吗？"

I pause for a moment to think about it, the idea does appear to me. I enjoy playing the cello, I like it a lot and I can really lose myself in playing whatever music I've selected be it someone else's or just improvisation. I guess it would be fun to play with others and have a conductor or even compose our own pieces. I just don't know if I'm ready for that.  
我停顿了一下，思考着这个想法，它确实浮现在我脑海中。我喜欢拉大提琴，非常喜欢，而且我可以完全沉浸在演奏中，无论是别人的曲子还是即兴创作。我想和别人一起演奏，有指挥甚至创作我们自己的作品，应该会很有趣。我只是不确定自己是否准备好了。

"I… I guess, I've never really done it before. When I first started it was just me and my tutor. My school didn't have a music department and in Tokyo-3… I never really had the time. I just… I don't know if I can, it's hard enough for me to be here."  
“我……我想，我以前从未真正这样做过。当我刚开始学习时，只有我和我的导师。我的学校没有音乐系，在第三新东京市……我从来没有真正有时间。我只是……我不知道我是否能做到，对我来说，光是站在这里就已经很困难了。”

"But you are here aren't you?"  
“但你不是已经在这里了吗？”

"I… I guess…" "我…我想…"

"And how do you feel about it?"  
"那你对此感觉如何？"

"Well… A little bit scared." I admit, "I just need to get used to it though, I know that."  
"嗯…有点害怕。" 我承认道，"不过我需要适应一下，我知道这一点。"

"It's the same with that then. The people in here, they don't know you just like the people in that group won't. They'll just see Shinji Ikari the cello player and a new member to their group. If the idea of playing in a group appeals to you then try it Shinji, push yourself and if you don't like it then you can always leave but if you don't try it then you'll regret not trying."  
"那么，情况是一样的。这里的人，他们并不了解你，就像那个团体的人也不会了解你一样。他们只会看到弹奏大提琴的碇真嗣，以及他们团体的新成员。如果加入一个团体的想法吸引你，那就试试吧，碇真嗣，逼自己一把，如果你不喜欢，随时可以离开，但如果你不尝试，你会后悔没有尝试的。"

I let out a laugh and shake my head, "I know… I've been trying to tell myself that and I've been hoping someone will say it to me. Rei and Misato they…"  
我笑出声来，摇了摇头，"我知道……我一直试图这样告诉自己，也一直希望有人能对我说这句话。绫波和美里她们……"

"Rei and Misato love you a lot Shinji, we all do but they have their own issues and I think they're afraid of giving you a nudge sometimes." Hikari explains, "You should do this, you said you've thought about it and the idea appeals to you. The only thing holding you back is your fear of the people there and just coming to the store that'll get easier over time."  
"绫波和美里非常爱你，碇真嗣，我们大家都爱你，但她们有自己的问题，我想有时候她们害怕推你一把。"光解释道，"你应该这么做，你说你考虑过，这个想法吸引你。唯一阻碍你的就是你对那里人的恐惧，只要来店里，随着时间推移，这会变得容易。"

I realize that Hikari is right, my fear of people is what is holding me back. The more I think about it the more I realize what I'm scared of is people recognizing me and what I was. I'm not scared of playing cello in front of people. I want to do that, I like the idea of doing that so I'm going to do it.  
我意识到光是对的，我对人的恐惧正是阻碍我的原因。我越是思考，就越明白我害怕的是人们认出我，以及我曾经的身份。我并不害怕在人们面前拉大提琴。我想那样做，我喜欢那个想法，所以我打算去做。

"You're right. Thank you Hikari."  
“你说得对。谢谢你，光。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

That was a mistake. That was a goddamn stupid mistake and I hate myself for it so much. Why did I even think I could do this? Did I seriously think I could just jump in here and get myself off like it was normal? Did I really think I could just lie back and think of those two without any problems? Of course not, I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I can't even do that without messing it up.  
那是个错误。真他妈愚蠢的错误，我为此恨透了自己。我怎么会以为自己能做得到呢？我真的以为自己可以就这样跳进来，像平常一样解脱吗？我真的以为我可以躺下，想着那两个人而没有任何问题吗？当然不可能，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我连那点小事都搞砸了。

It started off fine, the water was nice and warm and... well that started to feel good at first but then of course I had to start feeling the guilt. What the hell was I doing using their image to get myself off? I have no right to use their image for anything like that, most of all making myself feel good.  
一开始还好，水温暖舒适，嗯...起初感觉还不错，但随后当然就开始感到内疚了。我到底在干什么，利用他们的形象来满足自己？我没有权利用他们的形象做这种事，尤其是让自己感觉良好。

Then things got worse, I started to remember what I have done to Shinji in the past. I started to think about what Kaworu would say if he knew how horrible a person I was. Soon afterwards all the good feelings I had, the release that I craved had died away. It had been replaced only with a feeling of repulsion at myself and a desire to get out of there.  
然后情况变得更糟，我开始回想起过去对真嗣所做的一切。我开始想象如果薰知道我是多么糟糕的人，他会说什么。不久之后，我所有的美好感觉，我所渴望的解脱都消失了。取而代之的是对自己的厌恶感和想要逃离那里的冲动。

I glance at myself in self in the mirror for a moment. The scars on my body seem to be showing more prominently today. Two marks on my chest from where my Eva was impaled and the damage transferred to me. Strangely enough there was little scaring on my face, only what I see in nightmares. I quickly put my bra on and throw a shirt on over me to cover myself up.  
我瞥了一眼镜中的自己。今天身上的伤疤似乎更加显眼了。胸前有两处痕迹，是我驾驶的 Eva 被刺穿时造成的伤害转移到我身上的。奇怪的是，我的脸上几乎没有留下疤痕，只有我在噩梦中看到的那些。我迅速穿上胸罩，套上一件衬衫遮住自己。

I don't even glance back at the bath as I move into the front room, what a stupid idea. I should have known it wouldn't go well from the start. I never took well to baths, I've always taken showers but I thought lying back and indulging myself would be easier in the bath. I can't even remember the last time I took a bath properly. It must have been...  
我甚至没有回头看一眼浴室，就走进了前厅，这主意真是蠢透了。我早该知道从一开始就不会顺利。我向来不喜欢泡澡，一直习惯淋浴，但我想着躺在浴缸里放纵自己可能会更容易些。我甚至记不清上次好好泡澡是什么时候了。那一定是……

I try to cast my mind back and another unwanted image flashes into my mind. A delapidated house on the outskirts of a town, clothes folded up and left on a chair and a rusty bathtub with a naked shivering girl in it.  
我试图回想起过去，脑海中却闪现出一个不受欢迎的画面。一个破败的房子，位于小镇的边缘，衣服叠好放在椅子上，还有一个生锈的浴缸，里面是一个赤裸颤抖的女孩。

That was the last time I took a 'bath.' I feel sick.  
那就是我最后一次‘泡澡’。我感觉恶心。

I leave the bathroom behind and move into the front room throwing myself onto the couch. I quickly check my phone, I've had a message from Kaworu letting me know he is alright. I send him a quick message to let him know I'm home and working on the book.  
我离开浴室，走进客厅，把自己扔到沙发上。我迅速查看手机，收到了一封来自渚的消息，告诉我他一切安好。我快速回复他，告诉他我已经到家，正在处理那本书。

I open my laptop but any desire to do work has been flushed out of me along with any other desire. I feel nothing but emptiness and anger at myself. I don't even feel clean right now, I just feel dirty and wrong. I slam the laptop lid shut in frustration. This isn't fair damnit, I was happy earlier!  
我打开笔记本电脑，但任何工作的欲望都已被冲刷殆尽，连同其他所有欲望一起。我只感到空虚和对自己的愤怒。我现在甚至感觉不到干净，只觉得肮脏和不对劲。我气愤地合上笔记本电脑盖。这不公平，该死，我之前明明很开心的！

**13th September 2021 2021 年 9 月 13 日**

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo-2 东京-2**

I can feel the exhaustion as I open the door to the apartment and immediately set my cello case down on the ground. I give my sore arms and hands a little bit of time to recover from carrying the heavy instrument around before kicking my shoes off and announcing I'm home to the empty apartment. I pick up the case again and bring it through into the living room.  
我打开公寓的门，立刻将大提琴盒放在地上，能感受到自己的疲惫。我给酸痛的手臂和双手一点时间恢复，它们刚承受了重物的负担，然后踢掉鞋子，向空荡荡的公寓宣告我回来了。我再次提起琴盒，带进客厅。

As I sit down on the sofa I feel something else within me besides the tiredness. It's a feeling I'm so unused to feeling, pride. I was actually able to do it, I was able to go out and meet with that group and not run away. For the past week that is what I've been telling myself would happen. For the past week I've been terrified of meeting them to the point that I even contemplated calling ahead this morning and saying I wouldn't be able to make it in.  
当我坐在沙发上时，除了疲惫之外，我感受到了另一种情绪。这是一种我极少体验到的情感——自豪。我竟然做到了，我能够走出去，与那个团体见面，而没有逃跑。过去一周里，我一直告诉自己会发生这种情况。过去一周，我害怕与他们会面到了今天早上甚至考虑提前打电话说我无法到场的地步。

I could run away from it though. I couldn't run away because I actually wanted to do it. I wanted to be there, ahead of tonight I was even having dreams about it. It seems so silly but I was dreaming that I was up on stage with other people. I was playing music with them and I was enjoying it so much. Hikari was right, the only thing holding me back was my fear of others, I did want to be there.  
我可以逃避它，但我没有逃避，因为我真的想去做。我想在那里，今晚之前我甚至梦到过它。这听起来很傻，但我梦见自己和其他人一起站在舞台上。我和他们一起演奏音乐，我非常享受。光是对的，唯一阻碍我的是我对别人的恐惧，我确实想在那里。

Even being there wasn't easy for me though. At first, I was barely able to speak, I was afraid to open my mouth for fear that I'd be sick. Our first task was to introduce ourselves and tell the others a little bit about ourselves. I managed to mumble out my name and tell them that I originally started playing cello over ten years ago but I hadn't played it much in the last five years.  
即使在那里对我来说也不容易。起初，我几乎说不出话来，我害怕张嘴，生怕会吐出来。我们的第一个任务是自我介绍，并向其他人简单介绍一下自己。我勉强咕哝出我的名字，告诉他们我最初十多年前开始拉大提琴，但过去五年里没怎么拉过。

The others started to introduce themselves afterwards. There was one moment of fear for me when one of the violin players in the group introduced themselves. They had lived in Tokyo-3 and had always played violin but started taking it more seriously after the Third Impact. Their dream was to compose and perform a piece dedicated to their son who had died during one of the Angel attacks.  
其他人随后开始自我介绍。当小组中的一个 violin 手自我介绍时，我有一瞬间的恐惧。他们曾在东京-3 生活，一直拉小提琴，但在第三次冲击后开始更认真地对待它。他们的梦想是创作并演奏一首献给他们死于天使袭击中的儿子的作品。

From there the other members of the group introduced themselves on by one. There were about twelve of us in total. Two cellists, six violin players and four viola players. The youngest was a girl who played the violin, she seemed to be a year or two younger than I am, the older was a man in his early fifties.  
从那儿开始，小组的其他成员一个接一个地自我介绍。我们总共有大约十二个人。两位大提琴手，六位小提琴手和四位中提琴手。最年轻的是一位拉小提琴的女孩，她似乎比我小一两岁，年纪最大的是一位五十岁出头的男士。

After our brief introductions we were each asked to play a piece that we enjoyed or that meant something. I selected the Cello Suit No. 1 by Bach, it's a piece I play fairly often and feel I'm competent at. It was the first piece I pushed myself to try and learn on my own without a tutor asking me to and it is one I return to frequently. I typically see it as a piece I enjoy but it is also a piece that has some strange memories associated with it, it was the one I played on the night of a particular incident.  
简短的自我介绍后，我们被要求各自演奏一首我们喜欢或具有特殊意义的曲子。我选择了巴赫的《大提琴组曲第 1 号》，这是我经常演奏且自认为比较熟练的曲子。这是我第一次在没有导师要求的情况下，自己努力去学习的曲子，也是我经常回归练习的曲目。通常我把它视为一首我喜欢的作品，但它也与一些奇怪的记忆有关联，那是我在一个特定夜晚演奏的曲子。

After we each played a solo piece my tutor spoke to the group about what he would like to do with the group and plans for the future. He mentioned that he had a particular piece in mind that he would like to try to get us to learn for a performance later this year. For now, he would like to focus on getting us in sync with one another so will be running through some simple pieces next week.  
在我们各自演奏了一段独奏后，我的导师向大家讲述了关于小组未来的计划和他希望我们学习的特定曲目，以便在今年晚些时候的演出中呈现。目前，他希望专注于让我们彼此同步，因此下周将练习一些简单的曲目。

After that the session was over and I returned home. I am exhausted but happy. I was so scared throughout the session that at any one moment one of them might recognize me. I was terrified on the way home that the same might happen but neither of those things happened. Perhaps I shouldn't fear that happening anymore, maybe if I do keep on pushing myself as I am doing I can get through this.  
之后，会议结束了，我回到家。虽然疲惫但心情愉快。整个会议期间我都非常害怕，担心他们中的任何一个会认出我。回家的路上同样提心吊胆，但这些都没有发生。也许我不再需要害怕这种情况了，如果我能继续像现在这样推动自己，或许我能度过这个难关。

I reach for the remote control for the television when I hear a noise coming from the other side of the room. I look over and see a phone sat on one of the drawer units and let out a sigh. I bet Misato has left her phone here again, she's done that a few times lately. It's a good thing that we're watched twenty-four seven because if there was an emergency getting in contact with her would be a nightmare.  
当我听到房间另一侧传来声响时，我伸手去拿电视遥控器。我转头一看，发现抽屉柜上放着一部手机，便叹了口气。我敢打赌是 Misato 又把她的手机落在这里了，她最近已经好几次这样了。幸好我们全天候被监视，因为如果有紧急情况需要联系她，那将是一场噩梦。

I stand up and grab the phone from the cabinet. Much to my surprise it isn't actually Misato's phone but it's Rei's. I look at the number on screen, Private Number, I contemplate letting it go to voice mail but wonder if maybe it's important. If it is I should at least take a message for Rei, I tap the button to answer, "Hello?"  
我站起身，从柜子里抓起电话。出乎意料的是，这并非美里小姐的手机，而是绫波的。我看着屏幕上的号码，显示为“私人号码”，我犹豫是否让它转到语音信箱，但又担心可能有什么重要的事。如果是的话，我至少应该帮绫波记下留言，于是我按下接听键，“喂？”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early Morning 柏林 – 清晨时分**

The mouse cursor hovers over the sent button as I glance back up at the e-mail I've composed. I check the address bar and see his e-mail address wrote there. It is the same one that Rei gave me 'just in case.' I didn't think that I would ever need it, I'm still not completely sure I do now. What I've done was born out of a sudden urge.  
鼠标光标悬停在发送按钮上，我再次瞥了一眼已写好的电子邮件。我检查了地址栏，看到那里写着他的电子邮件地址。正是绫波之前给我的那个‘以防万一’的地址。我从未想过会真的用到它，现在也仍不完全确定是否真的需要。我所做的一切，都是出于一时的冲动。

For the past five years I've been able to avoid having any contact with him whatsoever. It seemed so easy to do as well. I just tried to avoid thinking about him where I could, even to the point where I couldn't even bring myself to utter his name. Recently it's become much harder to not think of him or say his name.  
过去五年里，我成功避免了与他有任何接触。这似乎也并不难做到。我只是尽量不去想他，甚至到了连他的名字都无法说出口的地步。但最近，不去想他或说出他的名字变得越来越困难。

Shinji Ikari, the boy that I ran away from so many years ago. What are you like now Shinji? What do you look like and what do you sound like? Who are you now? Are you still meek and afraid like I knew you to be? Are you still kind and protective like I know you be? Do you still hate yourself like I hate myself? Do you still think about me like I think about you? Do you even still like me?  
碇真嗣，那个多年前我逃离的男孩。现在的你是什么样子呢，真嗣？你看起来如何，声音又是怎样的？现在的你是谁？你还是像我记忆中那样温顺而胆怯吗？你还是像我所知的那样善良且保护欲强吗？你还是像我一样讨厌自己吗？你还会像我想念你那样想念我吗？你甚至还会喜欢我吗？

Shinji is of course not the only guy who has been occupying my thoughts as of late. Kaworu is a mainstay in both my thoughts and my dreams. I've been having more dreams of him and Shinji, the three of us together in different situations. It seems so stupid to dream of something like that. Yet something feels so right about it.  
当然，最近占据我思绪的不仅仅是真嗣一个人。渚薰在我脑海和梦中也是常客。我最近梦到他和真嗣的次数越来越多，我们三个人在不同的情境下在一起。梦见这样的事情似乎很愚蠢。然而，不知为何，这感觉又如此正确。

I wonder about what Shinji's life has been like since I left. I wonder if he has had a girlfriend or even a boyfriend in all that time. Rei mentioned he seemed to like Kaworu and wondered if maybe he liked him romantically. I wonder if maybe Shinji's love life has been similar to mine. He deserves someone good to love him.  
我想知道自从我离开后，真嗣的生活是怎样的。我想知道他是否在这段时间里有过女朋友，甚至是男朋友。绫波提到他似乎喜欢渚薰，并猜测他是否对他有浪漫的情感。我想知道真嗣的恋爱生活是否和我相似。他值得一个好人来爱他。

I on the other hand tried to keep myself distant. My one sexual encounter was a one-night stand after getting drunk. I didn't regret it, it felt good enough but I wasn't exactly after anything longer than that. Any urges I have I'm fairly capable of handling myself. At least I was, after my last attempt when I thought of both of them I just find myself disgusted by the idea. How dare I use the image of two nice people to satisfy my own urges?  
而我则试图保持距离。我的唯一一次性经历是在醉酒后的短暂一夜情。我不后悔，感觉还不错，但我并没有追求更长久的关系。任何冲动我都能很好地自我控制。至少以前是这样，自从上次我想到他们俩时，我发现自己对这个想法感到厌恶。我怎么敢利用两个好人的形象来满足自己的欲望？

It seems so stupid, that's just what we do as people. I wouldn't exactly be offended if Kaworu had thought of me like that. It's just what happens, it's not like I've had a problem with thinking of people in the past. Then again, I'm still waiting for Kaworu to realize what a horrible person I really am.  
这看起来很愚蠢，这就是我们作为人的行为。如果渚曾经那样想过我，我也不会特别介意。事情就是这样发生的，我过去也没有对想到别人有什么问题。不过，我还是在等待渚意识到我其实是个多么糟糕的人。

I've been thinking recently that maybe I should just cut off contact with him. It'd be cruel but better for him in the long run to be rid of me. I haven't been able to do that though. I've not been messaging him first but I've been replying to the few messages he sends me and keeping up any conversation.  
最近我一直在想，也许我应该和他断绝联系。虽然这很残忍，但从长远来看，对他来说摆脱我是更好的选择。但我还没能做到这一点。我没有主动给他发消息，但我回复了他发来的几条消息，并维持着任何对话。

I do want to see Kaworu again, I want to hang out with him again. I really enjoyed the past two times but I don't have anything pushing me to do it this time. I've not got my curiosity to send me over there and I've not been summoned by an emergency. The next time I see him it'll be because I'm invited or I invite myself over and it'll just be me, Asuka Langley Soryu, the mess of a person. I can't put Kaworu through that.  
我确实想再见真嗣一次，想再次和他出去玩。过去的两次我真的很享受，但这次没有什么推动我这么做。我没有好奇心驱使我过去，也没有紧急召唤。下次我见到他，要么是我被邀请，要么是我主动去找他，而那时的我，只是那个一团糟的人——惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我不能让真嗣经历这些。

Maybe I'll have an excuse tonight though if I'm able to do this. I feel like I need something or someone to distract me from it and maybe talking to him would help. At the same time, I wonder if it really would in this case. I know what Kaworu's feelings are when it comes to the subject of Shinji. He's terrified of Shinji and I can understand that. After all that happened between the two of them perhaps Kaworu has more reason to be afraid of Shinji than I do. Maybe I should have spoken to Kaworu about doing this first.  
也许今晚我能找到借口，如果我能做到这件事的话。我感觉我需要什么或某人来分散我的注意力，也许和他聊聊会有所帮助。同时，我又怀疑在这种情况下是否真的有用。我知道真嗣在涉及绫波的话题时的感受。他对绫波感到恐惧，我能理解。毕竟他们之间发生了那么多事，或许真嗣比我有更多理由害怕绫波。也许我应该先和真嗣谈谈这件事。

No, it isn't Kaworu I should have spoken to first, it's Rei. I should tell her about me doing this and let her prepare for the reaction. I should tell her that I'm about to release her from her burden of keeping that secret. I should let her know that she no longer has to worry about keeping our friendship secret.  
不，我首先应该谈的不是渚薰，而是绫波。我应该告诉她我正在做这件事，让她准备好应对我的反应。我应该告诉她，我即将解除她保守那个秘密的负担。我应该让她知道，她不再需要担心保守我们友谊的秘密了。

Or maybe I shouldn't do any of that. Maybe I should just delete this whole goddamn e-mail to Shinji and continue the damn charade. I move the cursor away from the send button. I... I can't do this, I shake my head in frustration, I really can't do this. What am I expecting to get out of this? Friendship? After all I did to Shinji, I can't just waltz back in like this.  
或者也许我根本不应该做这些。也许我应该直接删除这封该死的给真嗣的邮件，继续这场该死的伪装。我将光标从发送按钮上移开。我……我做不到，我沮丧地摇了摇头，我真的做不到。我期望从这得到什么？友谊吗？在我对真嗣做了那么多之后，我不能就这样大摇大摆地回来。

I save the e-mail into my drafts and pick up my phone. I am going to do one thing though, I'm going to call Rei. I need to speak to someone about what is happening to me. Maybe she can help me make sense of all of this.  
我将邮件保存到草稿箱，拿起手机。不过，我要做一件事，我要给绫波打电话。我需要和某人谈谈我正在经历的事情。也许她能帮我理清这一切。

I pick up my phone and select her name from the contact book. She should be free around this time, it's not too late over in Japan. The phone rings for a few moments and then finally someone answers. I'm about to speak when I'm suddenly stopped by another voice, _'Hello?'_  
我从手机里选中了她的名字，拨了出去。这个时间她应该有空，日本那边还不算太晚。电话响了几声，终于有人接了。我正要开口，却被另一个声音打断，'喂？'

Shinji... 真嗣...

My mouth goes dry instantly as I close it and try not to make any sound. A churning started up in my stomach as moments pass. He speaks again, _'Hello?'_  
我瞬间口干舌燥，闭上嘴尽量不发出声音。随着时间的流逝，胃里开始翻江倒海。他又问了一遍，'喂？'

I hold the phone away from me and stare at it in wide eyed fear. My entire body is shaking as I just sit on the edge of my sofa looking at the phone. Shinji is on the other end of the line. I can hear his voice clearly. I can... I... I can... I can't breathe.  
我把手機拿遠，瞪大眼睛驚恐地盯著它。整個人都在顫抖，只是坐在沙發邊緣盯著手機。真嗣在另一端。我能清楚地聽到他的聲音。我...我...我...我無法呼吸。

_'Hello? Is anyone there?'_ He speaks for a third time with a slight hint of annoyance in his voice. Around me everything seems to slow down. My thumb moves over to the button to end the call and it cuts off before I can hear him for a fourth time. I sit staring straight ahead in a trance like state and feel the phone fall out of my hands and land on the floor.  
'喂？有人在嗎？' 他第三次說話，語氣中帶著一絲不耐煩。周圍的一切似乎都慢了下來。我的拇指移到結束通話的按鈕上，在聽到他第四次說話之前就切斷了。我呆呆地坐著，盯著前方，感覺手機從手中滑落，掉在地上。

That was Shinji Ikari. Shinji answered Rei's phone for her. He... He was actually there on the other end of the line. That was actually his voice I heard.  
那是真嗣·碇。真嗣替綾波接了電話。他...他真的在那頭。那真的是他的聲音。

I slowly rise to my feet and just stand still for a moment trying to picture what he must have looked like as he held her phone and spoke to me. I try to imagine the confusion or annoyance on his face as he was met by only silence. I wonder if he knew it was me? I can't think straight but I think Rei has me on her phone under a different name. I wonder if she really does though. What if he knows now? What if he figures it out? How could I have been so foolish to have called her like that. I should have known there was a chance of this happening.  
我缓缓站起身，静静地站了一会儿，试图想象他拿着她的手机跟我说话时的样子。我试着想象他面对沉默时的困惑或恼怒表情。我不知道他是否知道是我？我无法清晰思考，但我想丽在我的手机上用的是另一个名字。不过，我真的不确定她是否真的这么做了。万一他现在知道了怎么办？万一他猜出来了呢？我怎么会这么愚蠢，那样给她打电话。我早该知道这种情况有可能发生。

I completely forgot the rules we had set down. I would text her first and then she would call me back. We said we would do this so that we could avoid a situation like this. I'm... I'm an idiot! I'm a damn fool!  
我完全忘记了我们定下的规则。我会先给她发短信，然后她再回拨给我。我们说好这样做是为了避免这种情况。我……我真是个白痴！我真是个该死的傻瓜！

I slowly start to come back to reality and I can feel something bubbling up inside of me. A familiar yet hated feeling, rage. My hands curl up into fists and I consider driving one of them into my legs in frustration. I manage to stop myself and instead reach for the closest object, a controller. I throw it full force towards the wall opposite me.  
我慢慢地回到现实，感觉到某种熟悉而又讨厌的情绪在内心涌动，愤怒。我的手握成了拳头，我考虑用力捶打自己的腿以发泄挫败感。我设法控制住自己，转而伸手去拿最近的东西，一个控制器。我用尽全力将它扔向对面的墙壁。

"IDIOT! IDIOT! IDIOT!" I scream out as I hear the sound of plastic smashing against the plaster of the wall. I see the controller break apart on impact and fall to the floor in pieces. I have nothing left to throw so instead I drive my fists repeatedly into the sofa shouting with each punch that lands. Finally, I collapse to my knees in exhaustion, my face leaning on the cushion. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes but I blink them away.  
“白痴！白痴！白痴！”我尖叫着，听到塑料撞击墙壁的声响。我看到控制器在撞击下碎裂，散落一地。我已无物可掷，于是转而用拳头反复捶打沙发，每击一拳都伴随着喊叫。最终，我筋疲力尽地跪倒在地，脸靠在靠垫上。泪水在眼眶中打转，但我眨眼将其逼回。

I am not going to cry over this damn it! I'm not going to cry! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! Despite my protests I feel tears trickling down my cheeks as I just kneel and let it happen. Suddenly I hear my phone go off, I jump in fright and stare down anxiously at the phone. I quickly wipe away the tears and with trembling hands reach for the phone. I contemplate letting it go to voice mail but see that it is not from Rei's phone as I feared but instead Kaworu who is calling me.  
我不会为这该死的事哭的！我不会哭！我不会！我不会！我不会！尽管我极力否认，泪水还是顺着脸颊滑落，我只能跪着任由它发生。突然，我听到手机铃声响起，吓得一跳，紧张地盯着手机。我迅速擦干泪水，颤抖着手去拿手机。我考虑让它转接到语音信箱，但看到来电并非我所担心的丽，而是薰。

Of all the times for him to actually call me, why does it have to be now when I'm in the middle of a breakdown? I should just ignore it and let it go to voice mail. I could do that but I can't do that. Instead I answer it and try to keep my voice steady, "H-Hello?"  
他偏偏在这个我崩溃的时候打电话给我，为什么非得是现在？我本可以无视它，让它转接到语音信箱。我可以那样做，但我做不到。相反，我接听了电话，努力保持声音平稳，“喂？”

_'Asuka, is everything okay?'  
'明日香，一切都好吗？'_

Good job Asuka, that was convincing. Guess there was a reason you never did well in school plays.  
干得好，明日香，演得挺像的。看来你在学校剧里表现不佳是有原因的。

"I'm fine!" “我没事！”

Even better, I go from sounding miserable and upset to snapping at him. Thankfully he doesn't seem to notice.  
更妙的是，我从听起来痛苦和沮丧变成了对他厉声呵斥。幸运的是，他似乎没有注意到。

_'Good, I am glad to hear that. Asuka, the reason I'm calling is... Well...'_ He trails off nervously which causes me to shift up a bit. I wonder if everything is alright with him, _'I don't think... I've thanked you properly for the last few weeks. Your help and your friendship has been invaluable.'_  
'很好，听到这个我很高兴。明日香，我打电话的原因是...嗯...' 他紧张地停顿了一下，这让我稍微挪动了一下。我在想他是不是一切都好，'我觉得...我还没有好好感谢你过去几周的帮助。你的帮助和友谊非常宝贵。'

My hand tightens around my phone, "Idiot, don't worry about it! It's nothing, I'm just being a good friend."  
我握紧手机，"笨蛋，别担心！没什么，我只是尽了一个好朋友的责任。"

He laughs but I feel my chest tightening. A good friend? Me? No, never, I could never be a good friend to someone, least of all to him. I have to get out of his, "Anyway, there is no need to thank me. Anyone would have done the same."  
他笑了，但我感到胸口一阵紧缩。好朋友？我？不，绝不可能，我永远不可能成为某人的好朋友，尤其是对他。我必须离开这里，“总之，没必要谢我。任何人都会这么做的。”

_'No, I do not believe they would Asuka. From what I have seen of being on this world few would go out of their way like you did. You... who had every reason to hate me because of who and what I was. You who... had no reason to help or be my friend. You... Well I wanted to thank you by asking if you would like to have dinner with me tonight?'  
“不，我不相信他们会像你这样，明日香。在这个世界上，我见过的很少有人会像你那样不遗余力。你……因为我是谁、我是什么而完全有理由恨我。你……没有任何理由帮助我或成为我的朋友。你……我本想通过邀请你今晚共进晚餐来表达我的感谢，你愿意吗？”_

I'm about to say something about not needing to thank me but the words get stuck in my throat as I realize what it is he has just said. Kaworu has just asked me to have dinner with him. Is this some sort of date? Nah, it can't be, he'll barely even know what romance or dating it. He is just being a friend and... as a friend I'll accept. Maybe it'll be good to get out of here.  
我正想说不需要感谢我，但话到嘴边却卡住了，因为我意识到他刚才说了什么。渚薰刚刚邀请我共进晚餐。这是某种约会吗？不，不可能，他几乎不懂什么是浪漫或约会。他只是作为朋友……作为朋友我会接受。也许出去走走会不错。

"Yes... Yes, that would be nice." I finally say.  
“是的... 是的，那会很好。”我终于说道。

'Great!' He almost shouts in excitement at hearing me say that, _'Then would you like to meet me at my place at half seven tonight?'_  
“太好了！”他几乎兴奋地喊出声来，听到我这么说，“那你想今晚七点半来我家见面吗？”

"Yeah." I nod, "That... That sounds great, I'll see you tonight."  
“嗯。”我点头，“那... 那听起来很棒，今晚见。”

We say goodbye to each other and I hand the phone up and the weird churning returns to my stomach. I try to think of it positively but something in the back of my mind says I should have said no. That it won't be good to get out of here. I try to ignore that thought, it's just dinner. He is just being nice.  
我们互相道别，我挂断电话，那种奇怪的翻腾感又回到了我的胃里。我试图往好处想，但脑海深处有个声音说我应该拒绝。离开这里不会是好事。我试图忽视这个念头，这只是晚餐。他只是出于好意。

I wander over slowly to the broken controller and pick up the various pieces, "Well Asuka... I guess you'd better go and buy yourself a new controller... and a new dress."  
我慢慢走过去，捡起破碎的控制器碎片，“好吧，明日香……看来你最好去买个新控制器……还有新裙子。”

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

**Tokyo-2 东京-2**

I can still feel an amount of paint on my hands as I reach up and open the door to our apartment. I've already washed my hands but I still feel like I'll need to shower for quite some time to feel completely clean. I didn't think it'd be possible to make quite that much mess but with a large amount of paint and a number of small children around it was inevitable.  
当我伸手打开我们公寓的门时，我仍能感觉到手上残留的油漆。虽然已经洗过手了，但我还是觉得需要洗很久的澡才能彻底感觉干净。我没想到会弄得这么乱，但有大量的油漆和一群小孩子在一起，这几乎是不可避免的。

I can't help but smile as I think about what might await me next week when I'm there. I cannot say that it hasn't been a rewarding experience working at the school. At first, I was not sure that it would be for a person such as myself but it turns out I've actually really enjoyed the experience. The children are, on most occasions, well behaved and I feel a certain sense of joy and pride when I am able to do things that help them.  
想到下周在那里可能发生的事情，我不禁微笑起来。我不能说在学校工作不是一种有意义的经历。起初，我不确定这对像我这样的人是否合适，但事实证明，我真的很享受这段经历。大多数时候，孩子们都很听话，当我能做一些帮助他们的事情时，我感到一种喜悦和自豪。

One of my proudest moments was when a boy had to read to me and I was able to help him get through the book. He seemed so happy that he was able to make his way through the entire thing with minimal mistakes. He has already promised me that he will find new books to read on his own and to me. I am looking forward to the experience.  
我最自豪的时刻之一是，一个男孩需要读给我听，我帮助他顺利读完了整本书。他似乎非常高兴，能够几乎没有错误地读完整本书。他已经向我承诺，他会找到新书自己阅读并读给我听。我期待着这个经历。

I admit, I was quite apprehensive about taking the role. I am aware of my differences not just in the way I act but also in my appearance. Due to how I was 'born' I do not look the same as others. Although now I am completely human I still retain my natural blue hair, pale skin and red eyes.  
我承认，接受这个角色时我相当忐忑。我清楚自己不仅在行为方式上与众不同，外表亦是如此。由于我‘出生’的方式，我看起来与他人并不相同。尽管现在我已完全成为人类，但我依然保留着天生的蓝发、苍白的皮肤和红眼睛。

I have observed that there are many others who find my appearance to be quite curious. I can feel their stares on me when I am outside and I can see or hear them whispering to one another. I have heard their comments and shouts and although I would like to say I can ignore them I simply cannot. Many have been hurtful, although I try not to show it.  
我发现许多人对我的外貌颇感兴趣。我在户外时能感受到他们的目光，也能看到或听到他们窃窃私语。我听过他们的评论和呼喊，虽然我希望自己能无视这些，但实在难以做到。许多言论伤人至深，尽管我尽量不表露出来。

Before taking this role, I did speak to Misato, Shinji and even Asuka about that subject. I suggested that perhaps I should dye my hair to brown and wear contacts to mask the more extreme elements of how I look. Both Misato and Shinji were against it. They said I should be myself.  
在担任这个角色之前，我曾与美里、真嗣甚至明日香讨论过这个问题。我提议或许我应该把头发染成棕色，戴上隐形眼镜来掩饰我外貌中较为极端的特征。但美里和真嗣都反对这样做。他们认为我应该做自己。

Asuka how, she was more adamant in telling me what I should do. In fact, it's probably the only time since returning that I have heard anything of the old Asuka come out. Asuka yelled at me, she called me an idiot and a few worse names too as well as asking me if I was stupid. She then threatened me, told me that if I dared to change my appearance like that because of other people she'd personally fly to Japan and wash the dye out of my hair and put the contact lenses in the bin.  
明日香如何，她更坚决地告诉我应该怎么做。事实上，这可能是自归来后我唯一一次听到旧日明日香的声音。明日香对我大喊大叫，她骂我是白痴，还有更难听的话，还问我是不是傻。她接着威胁我，说如果我敢因为别人而改变外貌，她会亲自飞到日本，把我的染发洗掉，把隐形眼镜扔进垃圾桶。

I still wonder if maybe I should have gone through with it just to see if she carried out that threat. I'd happily endure her yelling and shouting just to have her back in Japan again. Maybe she could have patched things up with Misato and Shinji and they could all be happy again. I really want her to come back, I want Shinji to know what she is well. I know how much the two of them miss one another and it hurts me so much to keep this a secret.  
我仍然在想，也许我应该真的去尝试一下，看看她是否会兑现那个威胁。我愿意忍受她的吼叫和责骂，只为让她再次回到日本。也许她能和美里、真嗣和好如初，他们都能重新快乐起来。我真的希望她回来，我想让真嗣了解她的真实情况。我知道他们俩有多想念对方，而我却要保守这个秘密，这让我心痛不已。

In the end I decided to retain my appearance. As it turns out the children did not care about it, I did get a few questions from them as to why my hair was blue and my eyes were red so I just told them it was because of a condition I was born with. I didn't mention that the condition was in fact that I am a clone of one of the finest scientists of her generation crossed with an ancient god like being.  
最终，我决定保持我的外貌。事实证明，孩子们对此并不在意，只是有几个孩子问我为什么我的头发是蓝色的，眼睛是红色的，我便告诉他们这是我天生的一种状况。我没有提及这种状况实际上是因为我是她那一代最杰出科学家之一的克隆体，与一位古老神灵般的存在的结合。

The children simply shrugged and went back to whatever it was they were doing before. This taught me that children do not seem to care too much about things like that. They get curious and will ask questions but accept things, it seems to be that they start to care most when adults tell them that they should care.  
孩子们只是耸了耸肩，继续做他们之前在做的事情。这让我明白，孩子们似乎并不太在意这类事情。他们可能会好奇并提问，但似乎一旦接受了这些事情，他们就开始在意，而这种在意往往是在成年人告诉他们应该在意之后才开始的。

I enter the front room and I turn to see Shinji sat on the sofa, he's currently reading through some manga of his. At his feet I can see his cello case. I almost forgot, today was the first group session for him. I wonder how it went, I know he was very nervous about it.  
我走进客厅，转身看到真嗣坐在沙发上，他正在阅读他的漫画。在他脚边，我看到了他的大提琴盒。我差点忘了，今天是他的第一次小组会议。我不知道进展如何，我知道他对此非常紧张。

"I'm home." I announce as I set my own bag down.  
"我回来了。" 我放下自己的包宣布道。

Shinji looked up from his manga and smiles at me, "Oh hey Rei! Welcome home."  
真嗣从他的漫画中抬起头，对我微笑道，"哦，嘿，绫波！欢迎回家。"

"Thank you." I sit down on the chair near to him, "How was your group session today?"  
"谢谢。" 我在他附近的椅子上坐下，"今天的小组会议怎么样？"

I see Shinji continue to smile at me, "It… was really good."  
我看到真嗣继续对我微笑，“那…真的很棒。”

A small smile comes to my own lips as I hear him say that. It makes me so happy that he found it to be good. I was nervous that it would be an unpleasant experience for him.  
听到他这么说，我嘴角也露出了微笑。他觉得好，这让我非常高兴。我之前还担心他会觉得不愉快。

"It was… scary at first but I think… I just need time. I need to keep going and maybe it eventually won't be as scary."  
“一开始…很可怕，但我想…我需要时间。我需要继续前进，也许最终就不会那么可怕了。”

"That is good to hear. Familiarity with the activity and the people will ease your nerves in such an environment."  
听到这个消息真好。熟悉活动和人群会减轻你在这种环境下的紧张感。

He nods, "Yeah… I think I just need to learn that people probably aren't going to recognize who I am. I keep on thinking that one day they will and… bad things will happen but… maybe they don't know who any of us are."  
他点点头，"是啊……我想我需要学会，人们可能不会认出我是谁。我一直以为有一天他们会认出我，然后……会发生不好的事情，但……也许他们并不知道我们任何一个人的身份。"

I nod back at him but at the back of my mind I can hear Asuka's words about Nagisa being attacked. I admit I have been more on edge when outside after hearing about that. I should have asked for more information on the incident but I did not think to at the time. She mentioned that the people who did it were part of the UN Agency that protects us but what their motive was.  
我朝他点点头，但脑海中回响着明日香关于渚被攻击的话。我承认，自从听到那件事后，我在外面时变得更加紧张了。我当时应该多问一些关于那次事件的信息，但那时没想到。她提到那些做这件事的人是保护我们的联合国机构的一部分，但他们的动机是什么。

Did they know who Nagisa was from before? Did they attack him because of who he was? If so then we should be safe. How were they able to find that out though? Information related to us is classified, unless perhaps they were a part of NERV when it happened. They would not be the only Section 2 agents who would go on to work for the agency.  
他们之前知道渚是谁吗？他们是因为他的身份才攻击他的吗？如果是这样的话，我们应该安全了。但他们是怎么发现这一点的呢？与我们相关的信息是保密的，除非他们当时是 NERV 的成员。他们不会是唯一后来为该机构工作的第二部门特工。

"Oh Rei, you left your phone here!" Shinji suddenly announces, snapping me from my thoughts. He gets up and wanders over to the drawer unit near my bedroom. As he does I look into my handbag in confusion and look, it seems he is correct. I did leave my phone here, I take the device from him.  
“哦，丽，你把手机落在这儿了！”真嗣突然宣布，打断了我的思绪。他起身走到我卧室附近的抽屉柜旁。与此同时，我困惑地看向我的手提包，果然，他是对的。我确实把手机落在这里了，我从他手中接过设备。

"Someone tried to call you earlier as well!" He tells me.  
“之前也有人试图给你打电话！”他告诉我。

"Oh." I look at him, "Who was it?"  
"哦。" 我看着他，"是谁打来的？"

Shinji shakes his head as he returns to his seat, "I don't know, one of those weird marketing calls I think. They were just silent after I answered it. It came up as a private number so I couldn't check.  
真嗣摇摇头，回到自己的座位上，"我不知道，可能是那些奇怪的营销电话吧。我接了之后对方就沉默了。来电显示是私人号码，所以我也没法查。

A private number… I feel a churning in my stomach as I look back towards my phone and immediately go to the call history. Sure enough it is listed there, 'PRIVATE NUMBER', I tap the icon and I see her information displayed immediately. Just as I suspected, it was Asuka and Shinji had been the one to answer my phone. He actually spoke to her and yet he has no idea about it as well. He doesn't know just how close he come to hearing that voice he has longed to hear for so very long.  
私人号码……我回头看向自己的手机，胃里一阵翻腾，立刻查看了通话记录。果然，那里显示着'私人号码'，我点击图标，她的信息立刻显示出来。正如我所料，是明日香，而真嗣接了我的电话。他确实和她通话了，却对此一无所知。他不知道自己离那个渴望已久的声音有多近。

My own foolishness in leaving my phone behind nearly exposed the secret I've tried to keep. Asuka is going to be angry at me for this. I need to try to put it right. I try to show no signs of nervousness and try to remind myself that her number was put in there as 'PRIVATE NUMBER' for this very reason. It was in case someone such as Misato or Shinji got hold of my phone should Asuka call me.  
我自己的愚蠢，把手机落下了，差点暴露了我一直试图保守的秘密。明日香对此肯定会生气。我得设法补救。我尽量不表现出紧张，并提醒自己，她的号码被存为'私人号码'正是为了这个原因。以防万一，万一美里或真嗣拿到了我的手机，而明日香又恰好打给我。

I also remind myself that Asuka calling me first is not a part of how we regularly communicate. It is always supposed to be me who calls her unless we arrange it the other way around. Both of these facts should serve to reassure me. It all went according to our plans, her secret has been kept and yet I do not feel good about this.  
我也提醒自己，明日香先打给我并不是我们常规的沟通方式。通常应该是我打给她，除非我们事先约定好反过来。这两个事实本应让我安心。一切都按我们的计划进行，她的秘密得以保守，然而我对此并不感到安心。

"Thank you." I finally utter to Shinji, keeping my voice as steady as I can. I go to my e-mails and text messages to see if perhaps she has sent me anything. As of now she hasn't, I shall contact her later myself to see what has happened.  
“谢谢。”我终于对真嗣说道，尽量保持声音平稳。我查看我的电子邮件和短信，看她是否发了什么给我。目前还没有，稍后我会联系她，看看发生了什么。

I am concerned that she would call me like this. I wonder if perhaps what I feared would happen has actually happened. Perhaps Nagisa has hurt her in some way. It is another thought I have to push out of my head for the moment. It is illogical to think such a thing has happened. Asuka is more than capable of handling herself and she is under protection. Nagisa is fragile in his human form as well, I do not suspect he could have hurt her.  
我担心她会这样打电话给我。我在想，我害怕的事情是否真的发生了。也许渚以某种方式伤害了她。这是我目前必须排除的另一个念头。这样想是不合逻辑的。明日香完全有能力自保，而且她受到保护。渚在人形状态下也很脆弱，我不认为他能伤害她。

Yet I worry about their relationship all the same. I am confused by the nature of their relationship. I would not have expected them to have become friends and yet there they are. I have been thinking about Asuka's words from our last phone call. I have been trying to understand how she and Nagisa are not that different but I am not seeing it for myself.  
尽管如此，我仍然担心他们的关系。我对他们关系的本质感到困惑。我本以为他们不会成为朋友，但他们确实如此。我一直在思考明日香上次通话时说的话。我试图理解她和渚并没有那么不同，但我自己却看不出来。

In regards to Asuka, she was at times an unpleasant person to deal with. She could be rude and arrogant, loud and obnoxious but there were moments when he true self shone through. She was brave, she was protective and she was warm. She would be the one trying to include everyone in activities. If she saw me alone she would drag me into the group. She would even go to an effort to make sure Touji and Kensuke were involved despite claiming she hated them.  
关于明日香，她有时确实是个难以相处的人。她可能粗鲁且傲慢，大声又令人讨厌，但也有时刻能展现出她真实的一面。她勇敢，她保护他人，她热情。她总是努力让每个人都参与到活动中。如果她看到我独自一人，她会把我拉进群体。即使她声称讨厌他们，她也会费心确保真嗣和健介参与其中。

For Nagisa, he was aware of what he was and what it was he was doing. I did not feel any attempt from him to escape that destiny. He fulfilled his goal without questioning it and he hurt my brother deeply. I do not feel that I should forgive Nagisa for any of this but then I also trust Asuka and her judgement when it comes to people. If she is capable of befriending Nagisa than perhaps I am wrong?  
对于渚薰，他清楚自己是谁以及自己在做什么。我没有感觉到他有任何逃避命运的企图。他毫无质疑地完成了自己的目标，深深伤害了我的哥哥。我不觉得我应该原谅渚薰的这些行为，但同时我也信任明日香和她对人判断的能力。如果她能够与渚薰成为朋友，那么或许是我错了？

I need to think about this some more and perhaps talk to Asuka about it properly. I do wish I had someone else I could confide in about this issue. Misato would be a good person to talk to but I cannot reveal to her the secret I am keeping. This has become so complicated, for all I have learned in the past five years there is so much that confuses me. Humans are such complicated creatures, myself included.  
我需要再仔细考虑一下，或许应该和明日香好好谈谈。我真希望还有其他人可以倾诉这个问题。美里是个不错的人选，但我不能向她透露我保守的秘密。这一切变得如此复杂，尽管过去五年我学到了很多，但仍有许多事情让我困惑。人类是如此复杂的生物，我自己也不例外。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin - Evening 柏林 - 傍晚**

I have been unable to keep the smile from my lips ever since I spoke to Asuka earlier today. So much so that I am sure Fuyutsuki and the others I work with thought that something was wrong with me. Asuka said yes to me. She said yes to my request of having dinner tonight!  
自从今天早些时候和明日香通话后，我的嘴角就一直挂着笑容，以至于我确信富士树和同事们一定以为我出了什么问题。明日香答应了我。她答应了今晚和我共进晚餐的请求！

I was so worried that she would say no. I am aware from various bits of reading that being asked out to dinner is seen as a romantic gesture for humans. I am not entirely sure if that is how I meant it to be. I just enjoy spending time with Asuka and wished to make up for all the help she has given me recently.  
我非常担心她会拒绝。我从各种阅读材料中了解到，对人类来说，被邀请共进晚餐被视为一种浪漫的举动。我不完全确定我是否也是这个意思。我只是喜欢和明日香在一起，并希望弥补她最近给予我的所有帮助。

Yet, I have wondered about the subject of romance since I returned. Would I like to become romantically involved with someone? At first, I was not so sure, I was so afraid of people that I was happy just keeping to myself. As time went on and I was exposed to a little bit more literature and media I did start to wonder what it might be like to be involved with another. I wondered what it might be like to have a companion, to have someone to hold and to love, someone who I could kiss, touch even make love to.  
然而，自从回来后，我对浪漫这个话题产生了好奇。我会想与某人建立浪漫关系吗？起初，我不太确定，我非常害怕人群，只满足于独处。随着时间的推移，当我接触到更多的文学和媒体时，我开始好奇与另一个人在一起会是什么感觉。我想知道拥有一个伴侣，有一个人可以拥抱和爱，可以亲吻、触摸甚至做爱会是什么感觉。

These were all things that I did not ever consider in my past life. Romance and sex meant nothing to me, they were all human pursuits and as such I did not have any urges in that manner. I felt things for people of course, nothing stronger than what I felt for Shinji Ikari but I knew my time was limited so I did not permit myself to dwell on such feelings.  
这些都是我在过去的生活中从未考虑过的事情。浪漫和性对我来说毫无意义，它们都是人类的追求，因此我没有那种冲动。当然，我对人有感觉，但没有比我对碇真嗣的感觉更强烈的了，但我知道我的时间有限，所以我不会让自己沉溺于这种感情。

My time is no longer limited though and as such I find such thoughts creeping into my mind more and more. I think about the sort of person I would perhaps like as a companion. I think about what preferences I have romantically and even sexually. In my meditations on the subject I find that issues such as gender are not a factor for me. I seem to find beauty across the entire spectrum of gender.  
尽管我的时间不再受限，但我发现这样的思绪越来越频繁地潜入我的脑海。我开始思考自己可能会喜欢什么样的伴侣。我思考自己在情感和性方面的偏好。在对此主题的沉思中，我发现性别问题对我来说并不重要。我似乎能在各种性别中找到美。

Sexually I feel very much the same. Whilst I have not had a sexual encounter with another person yet I have had to deal with certain urges that arise most on evenings. When dealing with said urges I have observed a number of acts, some appeal to me more than others but again I find sexual attraction across the gender spectrum.  
在性方面，我也有类似的感受。虽然我尚未与他人有过性经历，但我不得不处理某些在夜晚最为强烈的冲动。在应对这些冲动时，我观察了许多行为，有些比其他的更吸引我，但同样，我在性别光谱上发现了性吸引力。

There is one person who has been occupying my thoughts on occasions like this though, that of course is Asuka. I wonder what exactly I feel about her. I find her to be an extraordinary person. I am no longer able to sense people's souls like I once was it is not difficult for me to see the fragility of her heart. I know she has been through a lot of hardship in her life and she, much like Shinji Ikari deserve so much happiness.  
尽管如此，有一个人在这种时候占据了我的思绪，那就是明日香。我想知道我对她究竟有什么感觉。我发现她是一个非凡的人。我不再能像以前那样感知人们的灵魂，但我很容易看到她内心的脆弱。我知道她经历了许多苦难，她和碇真嗣一样，值得拥有很多幸福。

Yet despite the hardship she is a kind person. She reached out to me when she had no reason to. She helped me when no one else was able to and when I think of her I smile. I find her to be such a figure of beauty as well. Everything about her from her fiery red hair, he expressive blue eyes and her smile and hits me inside. I find that I am unable to take my eyes off of her when in the same room, there is something powerful about mer.  
尽管她历经艰辛，却依然心地善良。她在我毫无理由时向我伸出了援手。在我无人能助时，她帮助了我，每当我想到她，总会露出微笑。我觉得她是一个美丽的化身，从她那火红的头发，到她那充满表情的蓝眼睛，再到她的微笑，都深深触动了我。当我们在同一个房间时，我发现自己无法将目光从她身上移开，她身上有一种强大的力量。

Perhaps… Perhaps then I do like her romantically but I wonder if this is because she is new for me. She is something I have not experiences before. I wonder if maybe I have not lived long enough to feel such things. I wonder what the rules for this sort of thing are, if there are any rules at all.  
或许……或许我对她产生了浪漫的情感，但我怀疑这是否因为她对我来说是全新的体验。她是我未曾经历过的事物。我不知道自己是否活得足够久，以至于能感受到这样的情感。我不知道这种事情是否有规则可循，如果有的话，又是什么规则。

Of course, it is not just my feelings that matter in this situation. If I find Asuka attractive and I wish for more than friendship than that is one thing but it means little if those feelings are no reciprocated. Would Asuka find someone such as myself attractive? I am already aware that I do not look like a regular person. My appearance is not normal, I receive numerous stares from people every day that remind me of that. I receive comments every so often that remind me of that.  
当然，在这件事上不仅仅是我个人的感受重要。如果我觉得明日香有吸引力，并且我希望超越友谊，那是一回事，但如果这些感情没有得到回应，那就意义不大了。明日香会觉得像我这样的人有吸引力吗？我已经知道我不像一个普通人。我的外表不正常，每天都有无数的目光提醒我这一点。偶尔也会有人评论，提醒我这一点。

In a way that sort of thing does bother me, I cannot help the way I look. I was not given that choice and I do not feel I should change this for others. Even if such a thing is a hindrance in future matters. I am Kaworu Nagisa, I have silvery hair, red eyes and pale skin. That is who I am and I will not erase that.  
在某种程度上，这种事情确实让我烦恼，我无法改变自己的外貌。我没有被赋予这个选择，我也不觉得我应该为了别人而改变这一点。即使这在未来的事情中是一个障碍。我是渚薰，我有银色的头发，红色的眼睛和苍白的皮肤。这就是我，我不会抹去这一点。

I frown as I try to put these thoughts out of my mind for the moment. Asuka will be here in a few minutes and it would not be good to be pre-occupied with these thoughts. I need to focus on ensuring I am a good host for her during this dinner.  
我皱起眉头，试图暂时把这些想法抛诸脑后。明日香几分钟后就会到，如果我被这些想法困扰，那就不好了。我需要集中精力确保在这顿晚餐中成为她的好主人。

I look towards the living room and see the small dining table I have set up there. Across it is a delicate white cloth with two plain but elegant looking mats either side for the plates. Either side of the mats I've arrange cutlery according to a guide on dinner parts I have read. In the centre of the table is a candle that I'll light during dinner.  
我望向客厅，看到了我在那里布置的小餐桌。对面是一块精致的白色桌布，两侧各有一张朴素却雅致的垫子供盘子使用。垫子两侧，我按照读过的餐具指南摆放了餐具。桌子中央是一根蜡烛，晚餐时我会将其点燃。

Currently sitting in my fridge are ten bottles of wine. I did not think to ask at the time what sort of wine Asuka liked and felt it would be silly to call her. Having not sampled the substance myself yet I did not know what would work with the meal I was going to cook. So naturally I panicked and bought a sample of everything. This did earn me some strange glares from people, unfortunately I am not exactly able to explain my origins and therefore my reasoning for such a thing. All I could do was smile at the cashier.  
目前冰箱里放着十瓶葡萄酒。当时没想起问明日香喜欢什么酒，又觉得打电话问她太傻。自己还没尝过酒，也不知道哪种酒适合我打算做的菜。于是自然就慌了，买了一堆样品。这确实让我收到了一些奇怪的眼神，遗憾的是我无法解释自己的来历，因此也无法说明这么做的理由。我只能对收银员微笑。

The meal tonight will be a steak in a peppercorn sauce with a variety of vegetables that I have spent the last half an hour preparing. This will be followed by a homemade chocolate ice cream that I perfected making yesterday.  
今晚的菜肴将是黑胡椒牛排搭配我花了半小时准备的各式蔬菜。之后是一道我昨天刚完善的自制巧克力冰淇淋。

I look towards the kitchen clock once again and feel the nerves building up in my stomach. Questions start to go through my mind, what if Asuka doesn't come? What if she dislikes the food? What if I haven't done this right and she laughs at me? I take a deep breath, this is going to be fine, it's just a dinner for a girl I happen to like and who I am friends with.  
我又一次望向厨房的时钟，感到紧张在胃里翻腾。疑问开始在脑海中盘旋，如果明日香不来怎么办？如果她不喜欢这些食物怎么办？如果我做得不对，她嘲笑我怎么办？我深吸一口气，一切都会好的，这只是为了一位我恰好喜欢且是朋友的女孩子准备的晚餐。

Half a minute later there is a knock on my door and I take another deep breath. I answer the door and find myself rendered unable to speak when I see her stood before me. Asuka is wearing a long dark red dress with red gloves to match. She has straightened her hair and put on a small amount of make up with draw my attention to her eyes. Around her neck is a black choker with a little gold diamond hanging from the middle. She looks beautiful.  
半分钟后，门上传来敲击声，我又深吸了一口气。我打开门，看到她站在我面前时，竟一时语塞。明日香穿着一件深红色的长裙，搭配着同色的手套。她把头发拉直了，化了淡妆，让我不由自主地注视着她的眼睛。她的脖子上戴着一条黑色项圈，中间挂着一颗小小的金色钻石。她看起来美极了。

"A-Asuka…" I finally stammer out before moving to one side to let her in, "Come on in."  
“明……明日香……”我终于结结巴巴地说出口，然后侧身让她进来，“请进。”

She gives me a smile and nods, "Thank you."  
她对我微笑并点头，“谢谢你。”

She walks forward and enters the living room with me following behind. I smile as I see her stop and look towards the table. It is her turn to look stunned, "T-This is… I thought we were…"  
她向前走去，我跟随其后进入客厅。我微笑着看她停下脚步，望向桌子。轮到她显得震惊了，“这…这是…我以为我们…”

I make my way to the table, "I… Wanted to thank you for all you have done for me Asuka. I understand that cooking someone dinner is a good way of doing that."  
我走向桌子，“我…想感谢你为我所做的一切，明日香。我知道为某人做饭是表达感谢的好方式。”

"You… Cook, I thought you meant go out this is…"  
"你…库克，我以为你说的是出去吃，这…"

I smile and shake my head, "I admit that perhaps I am… perhaps not going to be as good as a high end restaurant but I wanted to do something for you. You have done so much for me, you… are not disappointed are you?"  
我微笑着摇摇头，"我承认可能我…也许不如高档餐厅做得好，但我就是想为你做点什么。你为我做了这么多，你…不会失望吧？"

She looks me, "No you idiot! I'm not… this is… really nice."  
她看着我，"不，你这个傻瓜！我不是…这…真的很棒。"

"Good, I am glad." "很好，我很高兴。"

She remains frozen to the spot and I watch as her eyes keep going from the table to me and back again. I try to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I move towards the fridge, "I was… unsure of what wine you would like so I got a selection. I believe certain wines are said to go better with specific types of food. We are eating a steak with vegetables in a homemade sauce. Yet I also hear people have preferences for wine based on country and colour, perhaps you should pick?"  
她依旧呆立在原地，我看着她的目光在桌子和我的身上来回游移。我努力忽视胃里翻腾的紧张感，走向冰箱，“我……不确定你喜欢哪种葡萄酒，所以选了几种。据说某些葡萄酒与特定的食物更搭配。我们今晚吃的是牛排配蔬菜自制酱汁。不过我也听说人们会根据国家和颜色偏好选择葡萄酒，也许你应该来挑选？”

There is no reply from her as I turn around and see her still frozen in place, "Asuka, is everything alright?"  
我转过身，她依然僵立不动，没有回应，“明日香，一切都好吗？”

She nods slowly, "I… You… I… I can't… This is… I'm sorry Kaworu."  
她缓缓点头，“我……你……我……我做不到……这太……对不起，薰。”

I'm barely given a chance to respond before she turns and quickly leaves the living room. I hear my front door slam behind her as I'm left stood in a stunned silence. I don't know what to do, do I go after her? Do I stay here? I try to listen for the footsteps echoing down the hallway and outside but I hear nothing. If I leave now maybe I can catch up with her.  
我几乎没来得及回应，她就转身迅速离开了客厅。我呆立在一片震惊的寂静中，听着她身后大门砰的一声关上。我不知道该怎么办，是追出去还是留在这里？我试图聆听走廊和外面的脚步声，却什么也没听到。如果我现在离开，也许还能追上她。

Questions run through my mind, did I do something wrong? If so what did I do wrong? Was it something I said? Was this perhaps too much for Asuka? None of that matters now I think to myself as I grab my keys and start to go after her. If I upset her I have to apologize, I have to find out what I did.  
疑问在我脑海中盘旋，是我做错了什么吗？如果是，我做错了什么？是因为我说了什么吗？这对明日香来说是不是太过分了？现在这些都不重要了，我自言自语，如果我让她不高兴了，我必须道歉，我必须弄清楚我做了什么。

### Chapter 7: Any Kind Of Sign  
第七章：任何一种迹象  

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I rush out into the hallway and hear the sound of his door slamming itself shut. I hurry along into the entranceway of the complex and pull open the door freeing myself from the confines of the building. A cool breeze immediately hits my face and I stop halfway up the path and take a few deep breaths to calm myself.  
我冲进走廊，听到他的门砰的一声关上了。我急忙走到大楼的入口处，拉开大门，摆脱了建筑的束缚。一阵凉风立刻扑面而来，我在半路上停下，深呼吸几次以平复心情。

My heart is pounding so quickly in my chest now, I can feel sweat trickling down my forehead and a wave of dizziness rushing over me. I prop myself up on a wall unable to go any further at this moment in time.  
我的心现在跳得如此之快，我能感觉到汗水从额头滑落，一阵眩晕感袭来。我靠在墙上支撑自己，此刻无法再向前一步。

I glance guiltily back at the entrance to the building. Kaworu doesn't seem to have followed me. He probably won't, why would he after what I just did? The poor guy probably hasn't got a clue as to what the hell just happened. He's probably stood there next to his oven, devastated after seeing me run out like that. I hope he understands that I had to do it though, I had to run away.  
我内疚地回头看了一眼建筑物的入口。渚薰似乎没有跟上来。他大概不会跟来了，毕竟我刚刚做了那样的事。可怜的家伙可能还一头雾水，不知道到底发生了什么。他现在可能还站在烤箱旁边，因为我那样跑掉而感到难过。不过我希望他能理解我不得不这么做，我必须逃离。

He had gone to so much damn effort, it was perfect and he was perfect. It was all so goddamn nice and what I wanted. He had been thoughtful and nice and was going to prepare a meal and serve wine. He even bought a fucking table with a goddamn candle on it. All of that effort for me? All of that for the wretched example of a human that I am.  
他费了那么多心思，一切都完美无缺，他也是。这一切都太他妈美好了，正是我想要的。他考虑周到，体贴入微，准备了一顿饭还要开瓶酒。他甚至买了一张桌子，上面还放着该死的蜡烛。所有这些努力都是为了我？为了我这个可悲的人类典范。

Kaworu… You think I'm someone I'm not. You think I'm… some nice girl who can be a good friend to you but I'm not that person. I am not…  
渚薰……你以为我是另一个人。你以为我是……一个能成为你好朋友的好女孩，但我不是那个人。我不是……

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

I freeze up as I hear the trembling voice from behind me. I fix my gaze on the road and daren't turn around to look at him. I try to take a step forward but feel only stiffness and pain in my joints. It's just like one of my dreams, I can't move from this spot.  
听到身后颤抖的声音，我僵住了。目光紧盯着路面，不敢回头看他。我试图向前迈一步，却只感到关节僵硬和疼痛。这就像我梦中的一幕，我无法从这个位置移动。

"Did… Did I do something wrong?"  
"我…我做错了什么吗？"

His question is like a knife being thrust into me and twisted. I should have kept running as far from here as I could. Now I have to answer his question and there is only one way I can do that.  
他的问题犹如一把刀刺入我心，还狠狠地拧了一下。我本该继续跑，跑得离这里越远越好。现在我却不得不回答他的问题，而唯一的方式就是……

"Idiot!" I snap back at him. It's all I can do at this time is to revert to that angry frightened girl. I feel my hands curl up into a fist, my nails digging into the palms.  
"白痴！" 我厉声回敬他。此刻我只能变回那个愤怒而恐惧的女孩。我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲深深陷入掌心。

"Please Asuka…" He continues, "I… If I did something wrong then I'd like to know. I apologize for any-"  
"请别这样，明日香……" 他继续说道，"我……如果我做错了什么，我希望知道。我为任何……

"Stop it!" I snap at him again, "You didn't… You did nothing wrong Kaworu, you…"  
"住手！" 我又一次厉声对他说，"你没……你什么都没做错，碇，你……"

My head lowers as I trail off and shake my head. I can't be bothered with fighting anymore, I'm sick of putting up those defences. I've been doing it for so long and I just… I can't bring myself to hurt him. I turn around to finally face him but I can barely meet his gaze.  
我低下头，话音渐弱，摇了摇头。我再也懒得争斗了，厌倦了那些防御。我已经这样做了太久，我只是……我无法让自己伤害他。我转过身来，终于面对他，但我几乎不敢直视他的眼睛。

"It's me Kaworu, I… I'm broken alright." I shrug, "You didn't do anything wrong. Everything you did was fine… It was lovely, in fact it was perfect."  
"是我，碇，我……我确实支离破碎了。" 我耸耸肩，"你什么都没做错。你所做的一切都很好……事实上，那很美好，完美无缺。"

"Then… why did you run?" He asks me, his voice still trembling. It's that trembling in his voice that is getting to me. It's that trembling that cuts into me.  
"那么…你为什么要逃跑？" 他问我，声音依旧颤抖。正是他声音中的颤抖让我心烦意乱。正是那种颤抖刺痛了我。

"Because I don't deserve any of it Kaworu." I answer him as honestly as I can, "You… You're a nice guy but me… I'm not a nice girl, I never have been and…"  
"因为我配不上这些，卡沃鲁。" 我尽可能诚实地回答他，"你…你是个好人，但我…我不是个好女孩，我从来都不是，而且…"

"Asuka…" I watch as he takes a single small step forward. In response I take a step away from him and hold out an arm to stop him.  
"明日香…" 我看着他向前迈了一小步。作为回应，我后退一步，伸出一只手臂阻止他。

"Don't… Don't come any closer to me, just… just stop it Kaworu, you…" I shake my head, "You're only going to get hurt. It's better that I just leave."  
"别……别再靠近我了，就……就停下吧，薰，你……" 我摇着头，"你只会受伤。我最好还是离开。"

"Asuka… Those things that you say you are, those things that you think you are… they are not the person that I have come to know you as. They are not the person that you actually are."  
"明日香……那些你自称是、你认为自己是的那些东西……它们不是我所认识的你。它们不是你真正的样子。"

"How the hell would you know? You've known me for less than a month!" I bark back at him, "You don't know the things I've done to other people! You don't know what I've said to them or how I've hurt them! You don't know what sort of monster I really am!"  
"你他妈怎么可能知道？你认识我还不到一个月！" 我朝他吼回去，"你不知道我对别人做过什么！你不知道我对他们说过什么或我是怎么伤害他们的！你不知道我到底是个什么样的怪物！"

Kaworu lowers his head slightly and I think that maybe I've 'won', maybe I've got that tiny hollow victory that my mind seems to be craving and I can leave this place. I can get away from this and go back to being alone like I deserve. A moment later Kaworu raises his head again and I see no fear in his eyes, only a fierceness as he takes another step towards me.  
渚薰微微低下头，我以为自己或许'赢了'，或许得到了那微不足道的胜利，心里似乎渴望着这种感觉，我可以离开这个地方。我可以摆脱这一切，回到我应得的孤独中去。但片刻后，渚薰再次抬起头，我看到他眼中没有恐惧，只有一种坚定，他又向我迈进一步。

"It is true that I might know have known you for a long time but in that short period of time I can confidently state that the Asuka you claim to be is not really who you are. I may not be able to see into the hearts of others like I once did but… I do not need that to see that you are no monster."  
“虽然我可能认识你的时间不长，但在那短暂的时间里，我可以自信地说，你声称自己是明日香的那个人，并不是真正的你。我可能无法像以前那样看透别人的心，但是……我不需要那样就能看出你不是怪物。”

His words catch me off guard, not only that but his way of speaking too. The trembling in his voice has gone, replaced only by a calm confidence. I open my mouth to reply but no words come out. I contemplate turning and running but I can't.  
他的话让我措手不及，不仅是内容，还有他的说话方式。他声音中的颤抖消失了，取而代之的是一种平静的自信。我张开嘴想要回答，但什么话也说不出来。我考虑转身逃跑，但我做不到。

"You are a kind soul Asuka, you helped me when you had every reason to hate me. You knew what I was and shown no fear of that." He continues, "I want to do the same for you. I do not fear you Asuka, no matter what you say or what you claim I am not scared of you. The mistakes of your past are just that, mistakes in your past."  
"你是个善良的人，明日香，你有无数理由恨我，但你还是帮助了我。你知道我是什么样的人，却毫不畏惧。" 他继续说道，"我也想为你做同样的事。我不怕你，明日香，无论你说什么，无论你声称什么，我都不怕你。你过去的错误就只是过去的错误。"

He takes another step forward, "I have seen what true monsters are in my former masters and you are not like those people. You are not like those people. You are a kind and compassionate soul with a fragile heart, you deserve to be happy."  
他又向前迈了一步，"我在前主人那里见识过真正的怪物是什么样子，而你不是那样的人。你不是那样的人。你是一个善良且富有同情心的灵魂，有一颗脆弱的心，你应该得到幸福。"

Before I know it Kaworu is barely a step away from me. His arms wrap themselves around me pulling me towards him in a warm embrace. I should be fighting this and running away from it but I can't. I'm just so fed up of running away so all I can do is stand there as this guy hugs me. My arms reach up around his back to return the gesture and my head rests itself softly on his shoulder as he rubs my back. I feel a few silent tears trickle down my face as I let him hold me.  
在我意识到之前，渚薰几乎已经站在我面前了。他的手臂环绕着我，将我拉向他，给予一个温暖的拥抱。我本该反抗，本该逃离，但我做不到。我已经厌倦了逃避，所以我只能站在那里，任由他拥抱我。我的手臂环绕在他的背上，回应着他的拥抱，我的头轻轻靠在他的肩膀上，他轻抚着我的背。我感到几滴无声的泪水顺着脸颊滑落，任由他抱着我。

We stay like this for a few moments before he finally breaks the embrace. I look at his face and see him blushing but also smiling at me, "Asuka… Will you still have dinner with me?"  
我们就这样相拥片刻，他终于松开了怀抱。我看着他的脸，发现他既脸红又对我微笑，“明日香……你愿意和我一起吃晚饭吗？”

I start to shake my head but then my stomach lets out an audible growl betraying me. I feel myself blush as I look up at him with a sheepish smile, "Yes… Yes I will."  
我正要摇头，但肚子却发出了一声响亮的咕噜声，出卖了我。我感到自己脸红了，抬头看着他，带着一丝尴尬的微笑，“是的……我会。”

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

I put the now clean cello bow down on the bedside table and pause the music on my player as I look towards the instrument in the corner of my room with a satisfied smile. I take a moment to actually enjoy the rare sense of pride I get knowing what I was able to accomplish today. I was not only able to go to that session but I actually played in front of other people.  
我把已经擦干净的琴弓放在床头柜上，暂停了音乐播放器，满意地看向房间角落里的乐器。我花了一会儿时间真正享受这种难得的自豪感，知道自己今天取得的成就。我不仅参加了那场演奏会，还在别人面前演奏了。

For me it feels like such a big achievement and I'm trying my best to hold onto that happiness for as long as I am able to. I know that maybe tomorrow or the next day those doubts and fears will start to creep back in but at I want to try to hold onto this happiness for as long as I can.  
对我来说，这感觉像是一项巨大的成就，我正尽全力抓住这份幸福，只要我能做到。我知道也许明天或后天，那些疑虑和恐惧又会悄悄袭来，但此刻我想尽可能长久地留住这份快乐。

As it is my mind has already started to wander to thinking about the next session. I'm already starting to wonder what I can play next time and wondering about playing with the others in the group. This will be the first time, outside of the two teachers I have had, I'll have played music with another person. I'm used to either a metronome or a backing tape so I'm a little bit nervous about the whole thing. I'm also excited and eager to hear what we can all do.  
因为我的思绪已经开始飘向下一节课。我已经开始思考下次可以演奏什么，以及与小组其他人一起演奏的情景。这将是我第一次，除了两位老师之外，与其他人一起演奏音乐。我习惯于使用节拍器或伴奏带，所以对整个过程有点紧张。同时，我也感到兴奋和渴望听到我们能一起创造出什么。

I start to get up from the bed to put the bow back into its box when I hear a soft tapping at my door. I sit back down keeping the bow in my hands and call out, "Come in."  
我正要从床上起身把弓放回盒子里，这时听到门上传来轻轻的敲击声。我重新坐下，手里还拿着弓，喊道：“进来。”

The door slides open partially and Misato playfully pokes her head into my room, "Shinji! I'm not interrupting anything am I?"  
门缓缓地半开，美里俏皮地探头进我的房间，“真嗣！我没打扰到你吧？”

I shake my head, "Hey Misato, No I was just cleaning my cello a bit."  
我摇摇头，“嘿，美里，没有，我只是在清理一下我的大提琴。”

Misato slides the door open fully and steps into my room. She takes a look at the clean cello and then the bow in my hands and grins at me. I can feel myself blushing already as I know what she is about to say.  
美里将门完全推开，走进我的房间。她看了看干净的大提琴，又看了看我手中的弓，朝我咧嘴一笑。我已感觉到自己脸颊发烫，知道她接下来要说什么。

"You know… I'm really proud of you Shinji, it can't have been easy doing that today. Well done."  
"你知道吗…我真的很为你骄傲，真嗣，今天能做到那样肯定不容易。干得好。"

I lower my gaze in embarrassment, I can't say I dislike or don't want the praise from her but it does embarrass me to hear it said so directly, "Thank you, I… I really enjoyed it. I know that… maybe this good feeling won't last but it's a start. I'm feeling… good at the moment."  
我尴尬地垂下目光，虽然我不讨厌也不想拒绝她的赞扬，但直接听到还是让我感到尴尬，“谢谢你，我…我真的喜欢。我知道…也许这种好感觉不会持久，但这是一个开始。我现在感觉…很好。”

"Well that is some progress Shinji! It's just one small step forward but it is a step forward nonetheless so just make sure you keep telling yourself that. When you are scared or doubting yourself just remember that you'd already made a stride down the path and you can keep on going."  
"真嗣，这可是进步啊！虽然只是向前迈出的一小步，但毕竟是一步，所以一定要记住这一点。当你害怕或怀疑自己时，只要记得你已经在这条路上迈出了一大步，你可以继续前进。"

"Yeah… Thank you." I smile back at her, "I'll be going again next week. My tutor said that is going to try to get us to play something together and talk to us about ideas for a show."  
“嗯……谢谢你。”我朝她微笑，“下周我还会再去。我的导师说，他打算让我们一起演奏些什么，并和我们讨论演出的想法。”

"A show?" She exclaims, "Well you tell me the time and the place and I'll be there! Do you know what it'll be?"  
“演出？”她惊呼道，“那你告诉我时间和地点，我一定到！你知道是什么类型的演出吗？”

I shake my head, "No not yet. He seems to… like a lot of stuff when I spoke to him so it could be anything."  
我摇摇头，“还不清楚。他似乎……对很多东西都很感兴趣，所以可能是任何类型的。”

Misato closes the door behind her and I see her look around the room for a moment before taking hold of and pulling out the chair under my desk. I nervously set the bow back down on my bedside table as I watch her. Misato isn't just here to talk to me about the session today, she wants to talk to me about something else.  
美里关上她身后的门，我看到她环顾了一下房间，然后抓住并拉出了我桌子下的椅子。我紧张地把弓放回床头柜上，同时注视着她。美里不仅仅是来和我讨论今天的会话，她还想和我谈些别的。

"Actually…" She starts, "There is something else I wanted to talk to you about Shinji…"  
“实际上…”她开口道，“还有件事我想和你谈谈，真嗣…”

I brace myself for the discussion and to think about that name and person once again. I've been anticipating this for the last two weeks, ever since Rei told me that he was back. I've tried to not think about him and push him out of my mind so I can focus on the music but I knew Misato would want to speak to me eventually.  
我为即将到来的谈话做好了准备，并再次思考那个名字和那个人。自从绫波告诉我他回来了，这两周我一直在期待这一刻。我试图不去想他，把他从脑海中赶走，以便专注于音乐，但我知道美里迟早会想和我谈这件事。

"It's about Kaworu isn't it?" I ask her.  
"是关于渚薰的，对吧？" 我问她。

Misato merely nods, "Yeah… What did Rei tell you about him?"  
美里只是点点头，"嗯……绫波丽跟你说了他什么？"

"That he came back earlier in the year and that she saw him in Germany. She didn't… I didn't react well to it I guess so she didn't say more than that."  
"她说他今年早些时候回来了，她在德国见过他。她没……我猜我对这消息反应不太好，所以她没再多说什么。"

Misato gives me a concerned look when I tell her I didn't react well to Rei's news. I try to ease her worries, "It's fine though I… it was a big shock. I hadn't… thought about him in some time and it brought everything back."  
当我告诉美里我对绫波的消息反应不佳时，她投来了关切的目光。我试图缓解她的担忧，“不过没事，我……这消息太震撼了。我已经有段时间……没想过他了，这让我回忆起了所有。”

Misato averts her eyes from me. After I had… done what I had to do to Kaworu Misato was the first person on the scene. She was the first person to see it and tried to keep me away from it. She tried to make me feel better about it but that was an impossible task at that point. It'd be impossible now, how do you make someone feel better when they're forced to kill what they thought was a friend?  
美里避开了我的视线。在我……不得不对渚薰采取行动后，美里是第一个赶到现场的人。她是第一个目睹这一切的人，并试图让我远离那一切。她努力让我感觉好些，但在那时这是不可能的任务。现在也一样，当一个人被迫杀死他们认为是朋友的人时，你如何让他们感觉好些呢？

"So it's… true then… he is actually alive?"  
“所以……这是真的……他还活着？”

She nods, "Yes… Yes he is."  
她点头，“是的……是的，他是。”

Immediately on her saying that I feel my face heat up followed by a churning in my stomach. I immediately start to focus on my breathing like I've been told to, the feeling doesn't fade but it also doesn't worsen, "How… I don't understand."  
她一说完，我立刻感到脸颊发热，接着胃里一阵翻腾。我立刻开始专注于呼吸，就像别人告诉我的那样，这种感觉没有消退，但也没有加剧，“怎么会……我不明白。”

"We don't know either Shinji, I've tried to find out what I can but we don't know how or why he came back. They said that he is human now though…"  
“我们也不清楚，真嗣，我试图找出我能了解的信息，但我们不知道他是怎么回来的，也不知道为什么。不过他们说，他现在已经是人类了……”

"Kaworu is… human…" I repeat her words and think about what that might mean.  
"渚薰他…是人…" 我重复她的话，思考着这可能意味着什么。

"Yeah… So… We're all safe from him I guess. I just… I wanted to talk to you about him and find out how you feel about it. I just… couldn't find the right time."  
"是啊…所以…我想我们都不用再担心他了。我只是…想和你谈谈他，了解你的感受。我只是…找不到合适的时机。"

"I don't know how I feel." I answer her truthfully, "I… I can just remember those few days Misato… I can remember everything about it and…"  
"我不知道我的感受。" 我如实回答她，"我…我只记得那几天美里…我记得关于那一切的点点滴滴…"

"I know Shinji…" "我知道，真嗣……"

"I know I had to do it but… I killed someone Misato."  
"我知道我不得不这么做，但是……我杀了人，美里。"

"He was an Angel Shinji, you had no choice."  
"他是使徒，真嗣，你别无选择。"

"He was a person as well!" I snap back at her, "Sorry."  
"他也是个人啊！" 我回呛她，"抱歉。"

She shakes her head, "No, it's fine. This is a difficult subject for this time of night… I should have picked a better time."  
她摇摇头，"没事，这话题确实不适合深夜聊……我应该选个更合适的时间。"

Misato starts to stand up, "Wait! It's… There isn't a better time."  
美里开始站起来，"等等！其实……没有比现在更好的时机了。"

She sits back down and I continue to speak, "I... I just don't know how I feel about it. I try to not think about Kaworu it was just… too much. I know I had to do it but that doesn't stop me feeling guilty about it. I always wondered if I could have done more or tried to find another way."  
她重新坐下，我继续说道，“我……我只是不知道自己对此有何感受。我尽量不去想卡洛，那只是……太多了。我知道我必须这么做，但这并没有阻止我为此感到内疚。我总是在想，我是否本可以做得更多，或者尝试找到另一种方法。”

She leans forward and puts a comforting hand on my knee, "You did what you had to do Shinji. You did what he wanted you to do."  
她向前倾身，安慰地把手放在我的膝盖上，“你做了你必须做的事，真嗣。你做了他希望你做的事。”

"I know." I shake my head, "I know that but I still wonder if it could have been different. Now that he's back I don't know if I should be happy that he somehow survived or angry about it. I don't know if I should hate him or not. I… I'm sorry, I know I make this difficult."  
“我知道。”我摇摇头，“我知道这一点，但我仍然想知道是否可能有所不同。现在他回来了，我不知道我应该因为他奇迹般地生还而高兴，还是对此感到愤怒。我不知道我是否应该恨他。我……对不起，我知道这让事情变得复杂。”

"Shinji you aren't making anything difficult." Misato pauses, "It isn't… easy to talk about this sort of thing or even think about it especially when it is still so fresh. You don't need to have all those answers now, you don't need to have them soon or at all. Just… I just want you to know what if you need anything at all or to talk I'm here for you."  
"真嗣，你并没有让事情变得复杂。" 美里停顿了一下，"谈论这种事情……或者甚至去想它，都不容易，尤其是当它还那么新鲜。你现在不需要有所有答案，不久后也不需要，甚至永远不需要。只是……我只是想让你知道，如果你需要任何帮助或者想谈谈，我都在这里。"

"I know, thank you Misato."  
"我知道，谢谢你，美里。"

Misato gets up off of the seat and hugs me, "I'm sorry you have to go through this."  
美里从座位上站起来，拥抱了我，"我很抱歉你不得不经历这些。"

I hug her back, "It isn't your fault."  
我回抱她，“这不是你的错。”

She breaks the hug, "I'm going to go to bed now Shinji. I have a meeting early tomorrow morning. I love you."  
她松开拥抱，“我要去睡觉了，真嗣。明天一早还有个会。我爱你。”

"I love you too Misato." She hugs me one more time and starts to exit the room. Just as she leaves I stop her, "Misato… What if I wanted to see him?"  
“我也爱你，美里。”她再次拥抱了我，然后准备离开房间。就在她即将离开时，我叫住了她，“美里……如果我想见他呢？”

She frowns for a brief moment, "Then… Maybe it could be arranged but he would have to agree to it as well. Why… What would you say to him?"  
她皱眉片刻，"那么…或许可以安排，但他也必须同意。为什么…你会对他说什么呢？"

"I don't know I guess… I'd ask him why he did what he did."  
"我不知道，我想…我会问他为什么那样做。"

"I understand, goodnight Shinji."  
"我明白了，晚安，真嗣。"

"Goodnight Misato." “晚安，美里。”

Misato gives me one final hug and I watch as she leaves the room and me alone with my thoughts about Kaworu. It's strange and maybe stupid of me but I've never been able to bring myself to hate him for what he did.  
美里给了我最后一个拥抱，我看着她离开房间，留下我独自面对关于渚的思绪。这很奇怪，也许很愚蠢，但我始终无法让自己恨他，因为他所做的一切。

I was definitely angry with him at first. He was the only person, the only friend I had at that time and it felt like he took advantage of that. He betrayed me and the trust I put in him but I can't hate him because I guess I just want to know why he did it. I know why my father did what he did and I do hate him for that. I know why others acted the way they did too and I've come to terms with most of it.  
起初，我确实对他感到愤怒。他是当时我唯一的一个人，唯一的朋友，感觉他利用了这一点。他背叛了我，辜负了我的信任，但我无法恨他，因为我只是想知道他为什么这么做。我知道我父亲为什么那样做，我确实因此恨他。我也知道其他人为什么那样行动，我已经接受了其中的大部分。

Kaworu… I never had an explanation for it. He was an Angel, the last one but why was he an Angel? Why did he have to do what he did? I know about SEELE and that he was sent by them so did he know what he had to do? Kaworu tried to tell me something when it happened but I didn't understand at the time. He spoke about humanity going on and living and how he had to die but I don't understand why. Why did he have to die and why did I have to be the one to kill him?  
渚薰……我从未得到过解释。他是使徒，最后一个，但为什么他是使徒？他为何必须做那些事？我知道 SEELE 和他被他们派遣，那么他是否知道自己必须做什么？渚薰在那时试图告诉我些什么，但我当时并不理解。他谈及人类继续生存，以及他必须死去，但我无法理解为何如此。为何他必须死，为何我必须成为那个杀他的人？

Maybe if I had the answer to that I could hate him or maybe I could forgive him. I don't know and I don't know what Misato and Rei would think of it either. I suppose they think I should hate Kaworu for what he was and what he did. After all he did hurt me, I'm aware of that, he hurt me so much and yet I just can't hate him.  
或许如果我知道答案，我就能恨他，或者也许能原谅他。我不清楚，也不知道美里和绫波会怎么想。我想他们认为我应该因为他的身份和所做的事而恨他。毕竟他确实伤害了我，我清楚这一点，他深深地伤害了我，然而我就是无法恨他。

I'm scared of him though. As stupid as that sounds and I can definitely hear that voice again telling me I'm stupid for being scared. I am though because I always wondered if maybe I could have done more to save him and what if he hates me for that.  
尽管这听起来很愚蠢，但我确实害怕他。我肯定能再次听到那个声音，告诉我害怕他是愚蠢的。然而我确实害怕，因为我一直在想，也许我本可以做更多来救他，如果他因此恨我怎么办。

I shake my head and get up off of my bed to put my pyjamas on. I try to push these thoughts out of my head for now. Kaworu can wait, these thoughts won't ruin what has been a good day.  
我摇了摇头，从床上起身穿上睡衣。我试图暂时把这些念头抛诸脑后。Kaworu 可以等一等，这些思绪不会毁掉这美好的一天。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I find myself following silently behind Kaworu as I enter his apartment again and once more look over the neatly set out dining table. With quite a lot of shame and embarrassment I sit myself down and try to not focus on Kaworu as he goes back into his kitchen to start preparing the meal. He gets to the fridge and smiles sheepishly at me, "I… asked before but what sort of wine would you like? I… Well as I said I'm a bit unsure as to which would have been appropriate so bought more than I probably needed to."  
我默默地跟在 Kaworu 身后走进他的公寓，再次环顾那张布置得井井有条的餐桌。我带着羞愧和尴尬坐下，尽量不去关注 Kaworu 回到厨房开始准备晚餐。他走到冰箱前，腼腆地对我笑了笑，“我……之前问过，但你想喝什么酒？我……正如我所说，我不太确定哪种合适，所以可能买得有点多了。”

For a brief moment I consider just asking him to bring everything he has over. Maybe I can get myself so drunk I'll pass out and forget all about the last two weeks. The more sensible side of me asks him to bring out a simple French white wine. Truth is I can't really answer his question, I likely know as much about wine as he does. I know French whites are supposed to be nice though.  
有那么一瞬间，我考虑让他把所有的酒都拿过来。也许我可以把自己灌醉到昏睡过去，忘记过去两周的一切。但理智的一面让我请他拿出一瓶简单的法国白葡萄酒。说实话，我无法真正回答他的问题，我对葡萄酒的了解可能和他差不多。不过我知道法国白葡萄酒应该不错。

He takes the bottle out of his fridge and opens it before bringing it over to where I'm sat. I avert my gaze as he fills up two wine glasses. I take the now filled glass and sip at the substance, it tastes nice enough I guess. I give him a smile and go back to thinking about how shamefully I've acted since getting here. I hate myself for not being able to keep it together and running away like that.  
他从冰箱里拿出瓶子，打开后走到我坐的地方。我避开目光，看着他倒满两杯葡萄酒。我接过已倒满的杯子，轻啜一口，味道还算不错。我对他微笑，然后继续思考自从来到这里后自己多么可耻的行为。我讨厌自己无法保持冷静，像那样逃跑。

It would be one thing to have just not come here or to have gotten upset like I did earlier today. That was fine because I was alone. I wasn't alone when I did that, Kaworu witnessed it and I can only imagine what he thinks of me now. Not only that but he actually stepped forward and hugged me. He held me and as nice as that was, as much as I longed for it, it has not helped me figure out these feelings.  
如果只是没来这里，或者像今天早些时候那样独自难过，那还好。当时我一个人，但逃跑时我不是一个人，渚薰目睹了这一切，我只能想象他现在对我的看法。不仅如此，他还真的走上前来拥抱了我。他抱着我，尽管那感觉很好，尽管我渴望那样，但这并没有帮助我理清这些情感。

"Do you feel better now Asuka?" Kaworu asks me as he moved back into the kitchen.  
“你现在感觉好些了吗，明日香？”渚薰问我，同时走回厨房。

I nod my head, "A little bit. I'm sorry, it's just… been a rough couple of days and with my book nearly finished I have a lot to do and think about, just… a lot of things…"  
我点点头，“有一点。对不起，只是……这几天挺难熬的，而且我的书快写完了，有很多事情要做，很多东西要想，就是……很多事情……”

"It must be a stressful time for you." He talks to me over the sounds of a pan starting to heat up, "How do you like your steak?"  
“对你来说一定很紧张吧。”他在平底锅开始加热的声音中对我说，“你喜欢牛排怎么做？”

"Rare." I reply. “三分熟。”我回答道。

Kaworu says nothing further as he continues to work in the kitchen. I watch him as he goes between cooking the steaks and sorting out the rest of the meal. I have to admit the smells coming from the kitchen are very appetising. I feel my stomach growl again in anticipation as he finishes setting everything out and brings a plate over to me. I can feel my mouth start to water at the sight of the food. The steak looks great, seemingly cooked just as I like it. The sauce, a peppercorn is drizzled lightly over the steak and the vegetables are also appealing.  
Kaworu 没有再多说什么，继续在厨房忙碌。我看着他在烹饪牛排和准备其他菜肴之间来回穿梭。不得不承认，从厨房飘出的香味非常诱人。我感到肚子再次咕咕作响，期待着他将所有食物摆好并端了一盘给我。看到食物的那一刻，我几乎要流口水了。牛排看起来棒极了，似乎正是我喜欢的熟度。黑胡椒酱轻轻淋在牛排上，蔬菜也同样吸引人。

I wait for Kaworu to sit himself down before taking hold of my knife and fork and cutting into my steak. I make sure I get a good portion and take some of the sauce with it. I try to ignore his expectant gaze as I chew through it and finally swallow. I normally dislike anyone watching me eat but I'll let him off just this once seeing as I can only imagine his nerves right now.  
我等 Kaworu 坐下后，才拿起刀叉切开我的牛排。我确保切下一大块并带上一些酱汁。我尽量忽视他期待的目光，咀嚼并最终咽下。通常我不喜欢别人看我吃饭，但看在他现在可能紧张的份上，这次就放过他吧。

I've barely finished the mouthful before he asks my opinion, "Was it… to your liking?"  
我刚咽下那口食物，他就询问我的意见，“你觉得……合口味吗？”

I nod at him, "It is delicious."  
我朝他点点头，“非常美味。”

"Thank you." I see some of the tenseness in his body leave as he also breathes a sigh of relief, "I was hoping that you would like it."  
“谢谢。”我看到他身体里的紧张感消散了一些，他也松了口气，“我本来就希望你会喜欢。”

Kaworu now starts to eat and the two of us sit there in a comfortable silence enjoying this meal that he has prepared. Neither of us speak during the course of it but every now and then we glance and catch each other's eye. We sip our wine and smile at one another.  
渚薰开始用餐，我们俩舒适地坐在那里，享受着他准备的这顿饭。用餐过程中我们都没有说话，但时不时地会互相瞥一眼，相视一笑。我们品着红酒，彼此微笑。

I'm the first one to finish both my plate and also my first glass of wine. I put my knife and fork down on the plate in satisfaction, "That was really nice Kaworu, I didn't know you were so capable."  
我是第一个吃完盘子里的食物并喝完第一杯酒的人。我满意地将刀叉放在盘子上，说：“这真的很棒，Kaworu，我没想到你这么能干。”

Kaworu laughs, "I am still… learning and there have been many accidents along the way but I am improving. It pleases me that it was to your liking."  
Kaworu 笑了，“我还在……学习中，一路上有很多意外，但我正在进步。很高兴你喜欢。”

"It really was." I reply as Kaworu also finishes up what is left on his plate and sets his cutlery down. We fall into silence again but this time it's also accompanied once more by the thoughts of how I acted previously. I know I hurt him when I did that and he deserves an explanation for it. I wasn't going to talk about it tonight but maybe I should.  
“确实很棒。”我回答道，Kaworu 也吃完了他盘子里剩下的食物，放下餐具。我们再次陷入沉默，但这次还伴随着我之前行为的思考。我知道我那样做伤害了他，他应该得到一个解释。我本不打算今晚谈论这件事，但也许我应该。

Maybe that would ruin the night though. I've already nearly done that by walking out, I don't want to do it again by bringing up that subject. If I don't now though then when will I? I might not have this chance again. That thing Kaworu did earlier for me, saying he wasn't afraid of me and just hugging me, he has no idea how much that means to me. I can trust Kaworu, not only that but those things I feel… maybe I'm justified in feeling them so I have to tell him.  
也许那样会毁了今晚。我已经差点因为走出去而搞砸了，我不想再因为提起那个话题而重蹈覆辙。但如果我现在不说，那我什么时候说呢？我可能不会再有这样的机会了。碇真嗣之前为我做的事，说他不怕我，只是拥抱我，他不知道那对我意味着什么。我可以信任碇真嗣，不仅如此，那些我感觉到的……也许我感受到它们是有道理的，所以我必须告诉他。

"Kaworu… I am… I'm sorry about what happened earlier. It is not just the book that is bothering me. It's… something else. Something happened earlier today and you have a right to know."  
“碇真嗣……我……我对之前发生的事感到抱歉。不仅仅是因为那本书让我心烦。是……别的事情。今天早些时候发生了一些事，你有权知道。”

"You do not need to apologize Asuka, I understand."  
“你不需要道歉，明日香，我理解。”

"No." I shake my head at him, "You don't understand, at least… you think you do. Earlier today I wrote an e-mail, a lengthy e-mail talking about a lot of things. I was going to send it to Shinji."  
"不。" 我对他摇头，"你不明白，至少……你以为你懂。今天早些时候我写了一封电子邮件，一封长长的邮件，谈了很多事情。我原本打算发给真嗣。"

"Oh… I see." I look up just in time to see Kaworu sag his shoulders and lower his eyes, "I understand."  
"哦……我明白了。" 我抬头正好看到薰垂下肩膀，垂下眼帘，"我懂了。"

"I don't know why I wrote it, I just… I guess since you arrived I've been thinking about certain things and maybe I felt it was time to get back in contact with them. In it I was going to tell them everything, why I left the way I did and why I've had no contact. I was going to tell them about being friends with Rei and explain that to them and I was also going to tell them about my meeting you."  
"我不知道为什么我会写那封信，我只是……我想自从你来了之后，我一直在思考一些事情，也许我觉得是时候重新联系他们了。在信中，我打算告诉他们一切，我为什么那样离开，为什么一直没联系。我打算告诉他们我和绫波成为朋友的事，并向他们解释，我还打算告诉他们我遇见你的事。"

"Why could you not send it?" Kaworu asks me after a pause.  
“为什么你不能发送呢？” Kaworu 在停顿后问我。

I shrug my shoulders, "I don't know… I just couldn't. I read through it a few times and it seemed fine but I could couldn't bring myself to click send. I guess…"  
我耸耸肩，“我不知道……我就是做不到。我读了几遍，似乎没问题，但我就是无法让自己点击发送。我想……”

I let out a sigh, "I'm an idiot, I guess all my life I wanted independence and to prove I could do things on my own but when it comes to something like this I want approval first. I wanted to tell Rei and… I wanted to tell you about it first."  
我叹了口气，“我想我是个傻瓜，我一生都渴望独立，证明我能自己做事，但当涉及到这样的事情时，我首先想要得到认可。我想告诉 Rei 和……我想先告诉你这件事。”

I shake my head, "Damn thing involves you so I guess it was only right you were told just in case something happened. Not that it would, I'd make sure of that."  
我摇了摇头，“这破事儿牵扯到你，所以我想还是得告诉你，万一出什么事。不过不会的，我会确保没事的。”

"Yeah…" “是啊……”

"Anyway I… I tried to phone Rei this afternoon but it wasn't her who answered the phone. It was Shinji…"  
“话说回来，我……我今天下午试着给丽打电话，但接电话的不是她，是真嗣……”

Kaworu snaps to attention on hearing me say that. His eyes are locked firmly on me and I can see that same terrified look on his face that he had when I first met him, "You… You spoke to him?"  
听到我这么说，渚薰立刻警觉起来。他的目光紧紧锁定在我身上，我看到他脸上那初次见面时的惊恐表情，“你……你和他通话了？”

"No. No I didn't." I shake my head again and smile, "I heard his voice and I kept silent. Eventually I just hung up and then not long afterwards you called me to arrange this."  
“没有，我没有。”我再次摇头微笑，“我听到了他的声音，但我保持沉默。最终我只是挂断了电话，不久之后你就打给我安排这次见面。”

"So that is the reason you did not seem alright on the phone?" Kaworu asks me.  
“所以这就是你在电话里显得不太对劲的原因？”渚薰问我。

"Exactly." I admit, "It put me in something of a bad place. Maybe I should have told you this on the phone, it might have made things easier. When I came here tonight I still felt awful and… what you had done was so nice it just overwhelmed me. I'm sorry I ruined it, you must have spent a lot of time planning it and I've not exactly been the guest you anticipated."  
“确实。”我承认道，“这让我陷入了某种困境。也许我本该在电话里告诉你，那样可能会让事情简单些。今晚我来这里时，心情依然很糟，而你所做的一切是如此美好，以至于让我感到不知所措。对不起，我搞砸了，你一定花了很多时间来策划这一切，而我显然不是你预期的那位客人。”

I feel my shoulders sag as I wait for him to reply. In a strange way I do feel better now for having told him about all of this. I glance back down at the table hoping that he'll say something soon, it'll make the rest of this night easier.  
我感到肩膀下垂，等待他的回复。奇怪的是，把这些都告诉他之后，我感觉好多了。我再次瞥向桌子，希望他能尽快说些什么，这样今晚剩下的时间会容易些。

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

I slide Shinji's door shut behind me and let out a sigh when I'm back in the middle of the room. I honestly don't know what I was expecting Shinji to say when I spoke to him about Nagisa but on the top of that list was the idea of meeting with him. I know Shinji didn't directly ask about it and maybe he won't but I certainly didn't think about the possibility.  
我轻轻关上真嗣的门，回到房间中央时叹了口气。老实说，我不知道当我向真嗣提起渚时，我期待他会说什么，但其中最不希望的就是与他见面。我知道真嗣并没有直接提到这件事，也许他不会提，但我确实没有考虑过这种可能性。

One thing I do know is that I cannot allow a meeting between those two to happen. I can't allow for Nagisa to hurt Shinji again like he did so many years ago. I'm not just Shinji's guardian anymore, I'm now his mother, I am now his family and I swore to protect him. I don't want to hurt him or deny him anything but this… This I feel I have to deny him if I have to.  
有一点我很清楚，那就是我不能让那两个人见面。我不能让渚再次像多年前那样伤害真嗣。我不再是真嗣的监护人，现在我是他的母亲，我是他的家人，我发誓要保护他。我不想伤害他或拒绝他任何事情，但这件事……这件事我觉得我必须拒绝他，如果必须的话。

Since learning about Nagisa's return I have been making an attempt to find out what I can about him. I've heard very little from Fuyutsuki about the boy which I suppose is a good thing. There was mention of an incident two weeks ago which resulted in two members of security being removed but the details aren't known to me.  
自从得知渚的归来，我一直在努力了解他的情况。我从冬月那里听到的关于那孩子的消息很少，我想这算是件好事。两周前发生了一起事件，导致两名保安人员被撤换，但具体细节我不清楚。

Despite there not being any major incident I still have this bad feeling in the pit of my stomach about the situation. I've been reassured that Nagisa poses no threat but I just don't think I'll be able to see it that way. I know what he was and I know how dangerous he was.  
尽管没有发生什么重大事件，但我对这种情况仍有一种不好的预感。我被保证说渚没有威胁，但我就是无法这样看待。我知道他过去是什么样的人，也知道他有多危险。

Nagisa wasn't just an Angel. He was an Angel that came to us in human form. He was an Angel that managed to get into NERV and manipulated Shinji before tearing the poor kid apart. He worked with the true enemy in SEELE to get himself into that organization and do what he did. He was aware of everything he was doing.  
渚薰不仅仅是一个天使。他是以人类形态来到我们身边的天使。他设法进入了 NERV，并在撕裂可怜的碇真嗣之前操纵了他。他与真正的敌人 SEELE 合作，让自己进入那个组织并实施了他的计划。他清楚自己所做的一切。

I can still remember the horrific scenes I witnessed when I went down after Shinji had to kill him. I was the first one on the scene and I had to pull Shinji out of the entry plug. I held him as he vomited into the lake of LCL upon witnessing it all himself. I heard Shinji speak as he blamed himself and said that he should have been the one to die instead of Kaworu.  
我至今仍记得当我下去时目睹的可怕场景，那是真嗣不得不杀死他之后。我是第一个到达现场的人，我不得不把真嗣从插入栓中拉出来。我抱着他，他亲眼目睹一切后在 LCL 湖中呕吐。我听到真嗣自责地说，他本应该死去，而不是代替铃原。

Maybe I should take some of the blame for how broken Shinji was back then too. Maybe I should have done more in the months before to help him… No, not maybe. I should have done a hell of a lot more to help him, I failed both Shinji and Asuka back then. I made no effort to understand them nor help them. I was content to use them as tools to aid my own personal crusade.  
也许我也应该为当时真嗣的崩溃承担一些责任。也许在那之前的几个月里，我应该做得更多来帮助他……不，不是也许。我本应该做更多来帮助他，我那时辜负了真嗣和明日香。我没有努力去理解他们，也没有帮助他们。我满足于将他们作为工具来支持我个人的十字军行动。

In many ways I was no better than his father. I drank myself to excess to forget it all back then and make jokes and acted like a fool. I've tried to change that now though, I've tried desperately to rectify it. Asuka… Well she went away and we haven't heard from her in years, I failed her but with Shinji… I won't let myself fail him. I can't let Shinji be hurt like that again, I have to help him and protect him. I won't let Nagisa hurt him.  
在很多方面，我并不比他的父亲强。那时我酗酒过度，以此忘却一切，说着笑话，表现得像个傻瓜。但现在我努力改变，拼命想要弥补。明日香……她离开了，多年来杳无音讯，我辜负了她，但对真嗣……我不能再让他失望。我不能让真嗣再次受到那样的伤害，我必须帮助他、保护他。我不会让渚再伤害他。

As I sit myself down on the sofa I look towards the hallway at the other closed door there, the one belonging to Rei. I realize that ever since I picked her up from the airport I haven't really had the time to speak to her about this either. Even worse I left it up to her to tell Shinji about Nagisa coming back. For all my promises I can't help but feel I'm not doing a good job of this parenting thing.  
当我坐到沙发上，目光投向走廊另一端的紧闭的门，那是属于绫波的房间。我意识到，自从从机场接她回来后，我还没真正有时间和她谈这件事。更糟糕的是，我让她自己去告诉真嗣渚回来的消息。尽管我许下了承诺，但我还是忍不住觉得自己在育儿这件事上做得不够好。

I get up from my seat and make my way over to the door and slide it open. I'm about to stick my head in and say something when I hear her talking to someone.  
我从座位上起身，走向那扇门并轻轻拉开。正当我准备探头进去说些什么时，我听到她在和某人说话。

"… I hope you are alright, please call me when you get this message. I will talk to you soon."  
“…希望你一切安好，收到这条消息后请给我回电。我们很快再聊。”

Rei hands up the phone and I announce myself, "Rei?"  
丽挂断电话，我自报家门，“丽？”

She jumps in fright at the sound of my voice, "Is everything alright?"  
她被我的声音吓了一跳，“一切都好吗？”

Rei puts her phone down and sits herself at the edge of her bed, "It is fine, I was just trying to contact a friend."  
丽放下手机，坐在床边，“没事，我只是想联系一个朋友。”

"Oh?" I can't help but feel a little smile creep onto my lips. Judging by her reaction I wonder if maybe this friend was a bit more. Whilst I do my best to not tease either of them about their lives of friends but occasionally I do feel that urge, "Was it a… special friend perhaps?"  
“哦？”我不禁感到一丝微笑爬上嘴角。从她的反应来看，我猜想这位朋友可能不止于此。虽然我尽力不去调侃他们的朋友生活，但偶尔还是会有那种冲动，“或许是……特别的朋友？”

Rei, unlike Shinji, is pretty much impervious to any of my teasing and shrugs it off, "No, it was just a friend I made whilst I was travelling. They have been unwell recently and I was concerned about them."  
丽不像真嗣，她对我的调侃几乎免疫，轻松地耸了耸肩，“不，只是旅行时认识的朋友。他们最近身体不适，我有点担心。”

"Oh! That's very nice of you Rei." I respond, "It's nice to see you making friends in your travels, maybe one day we can meet them."  
"哦！丽，你真是太好了。" 我回应道，"很高兴看到你在旅途中结交朋友，也许有一天我们能见到他们。"

"I do not know if that would be likely given the circumstances, but it would be nice." Rei replies, "Is there something troubling you?"  
"考虑到目前的状况，这可能不太现实，但确实很美好。" 丽回答，"你有什么烦心事吗？"

As Rei speaks I notice her gaze shift ever so slightly away from me. I sense that there is possibly something more to her 'friend than she is actually willing to tell me. It's funny but despite her being impervious to my teasing, unlike Shinji, she does share other traits with Shinji. If there is something bothering the two of them they each have this little way of averting their gaze and having a certain expression that gives them away.  
当丽说话时，我注意到她的目光微微从我身上移开。我感觉到她口中的'朋友'可能还有更多她不愿告诉我的事情。有趣的是，尽管她不像真嗣那样容易被我逗乐，但她确实和真嗣有其他相似之处。如果他们俩有什么困扰，他们各自都有这种小动作——转移视线并带着某种表情，这让他们露出了破绽。

I wonder for a moment if maybe I should pursue the subject further but figure it best not to for the moment. I don't want to seem too overbearing when it comes to Rei, I want to be there for her but I also want to give her the space to figure things out. Also, unlike Shinji, if something is bothering Rei she will generally speak to me first. It's a situation that has led to some interesting conversations, ones that have even made me blush.  
我一时好奇是否该继续探究这个话题，但觉得眼下最好还是不要。在丽的事情上，我不想显得过于强势，我希望能陪伴她，同时也给她空间去理清思绪。而且，与真嗣不同，如果丽有什么困扰，她通常会先来找我倾诉。这种情况曾引发过一些有趣的对话，甚至让我脸红。

"You could say that." I answer her, "I spoke to Shinji a moment ago about the Nagisa thing."  
“可以这么说。”我回答她，“刚才我和真嗣谈了谈渚的事情。”

"I see, how was he?"  
“这样啊，他怎么样？”

"He seemed alright but he… said something that worried me I guess. It's probably nothing to worry about though. I just… I wanted to see how you were doing as well I suppose, I realized I haven't really spoken to you about it either."  
"他看起来还好，但他……说了些让我担心的话，我想。不过可能没什么好担心的。我只是……我也想看看你怎么样了，我想我还没真正和你谈过这件事。"

Rei nods, "I am fine with it as long as Nagisa does not attempt to make contact with my brother. If he stays away from us and does not cause any problems then I see no reason to worry about him. What did Shinji say that worried you?"  
丽点点头，"只要渚不试图联系我哥哥，我可以接受。如果他远离我们，不惹麻烦，那我就没有理由担心他。真嗣说了什么让你担心的话？"

"He asked me what would happen if he wanted to meet Nagisa." I answer her truthfully. Straight away I see a scowl from on her face. In some strange way it comforts me that she seems to share my views on Nagisa. I know from our discussion a few weeks ago she doesn't view him favourably and what she has just said also confirms that she sees Nagisa the same way I do, as a threat.  
"他问我如果他想见渚会发生什么。" 我如实回答她。我立刻看到她脸上露出了不悦的表情。从某种奇怪的角度来说，这让我感到安慰，因为她似乎和我一样对渚有看法。我知道几周前我们的讨论中她对他并不看好，她刚才的话也证实了她和我一样，把渚视为威胁。

"I do not believe that would be a wise decision." She finally says.  
"我认为那不是明智的决定。" 她终于说道。

I nod my head, "Yes, I agree."  
我点头，"是的，我同意。"

"Did Shinji say why he might desire this?"  
"真嗣有说他为什么想要这样做吗？"

"Not really, said he wanted to know why Nagisa did what he did. You know what Shinji is like though, I don't think he sees Nagisa in the same light we do. I think he might still see himself as being the one at fault."  
“并不完全是，他说他想知道渚为什么要那么做。不过你知道真嗣的脾气，我觉得他看待渚的眼光和我们不一样。他可能还是认为自己才是有错的那一方。”

"That is certainly a possibility." Rei nods, "I do not believe my brother has ever been able to confront that particular time in his life. It was not a pleasant time for any of us to come to terms with."  
“这确实有可能。”绫波点头道，“我哥哥从未能直面那段人生中的特殊时期。对我们任何人来说，那都不是一段容易接受的经历。”

She lowers her head, "Nagisa… for all he was and all he did was something of a source of light for Shinji and it is hard for him to extinguish that."  
她低下头，“渚……无论他是什么样的人，做了什么，对真嗣来说都是一束光，要他熄灭这束光很难。”

"Nagisa was the enemy." I state flatly knowing that Rei is right. When Shinji was with Nagisa he actually seemed happy. Nagisa's interactions with him seemed genuine and I know Nagisa did bring Shinji some fleeting happiness which was so valuable back then.  
"“渚是敌人。”我直截了当地说，知道零是对的。当真嗣和渚在一起时，他看起来真的很快乐。渚与他之间的互动显得真诚，我知道渚确实给真嗣带来了短暂的快乐，这在当时是如此珍贵。”

"I know that and it would be my desire that Nagisa does not have any contact with my brother." Rei says coldly before pausing, "Yet, I would also not wish to stand in Shinji's way should he desire contact again."  
“我知道，我也希望渚不要再和我弟弟有任何接触。”零冷冷地说，然后停顿了一下，“然而，如果真嗣再次渴望与渚接触，我也不希望成为他的阻碍。”

"Even if it could hurt him?" I ask, somewhat confused by what Rei has said.  
"“即使这可能会伤害他？”我问道，对零的话感到有些困惑。”

"If my brother were to be hurt by Nagisa he would have me to answer to. I would be sure to warn Nagisa of this before contact is made."  
"如果我的弟弟被渚伤害了，他得向我交代。我会在他们接触之前警告渚这一点。"

"So if Shinji did ask, you think I should let him?"  
"所以如果真嗣真的问了，你觉得我应该答应他吗？"

Rei nods, "It is against what I believe and what you believe but it is not for us to make that decision. Shinji must be able to figure it out for himself and I think blocking him would hurt him more."  
绫波点头，“这与我所信奉的以及你所信奉的相悖，但那不是我们能决定的。真嗣必须自己想清楚，我认为阻止他只会对他伤害更大。”

I feel a smile spread as I listen to Rei speak, it's strange but despite her only having been completely human for a few years she has grown so much in that short space of time. She has matured so much and can provide good insight when needed. So many times when I speak to her I forget that I am supposed to be the adult.  
听着丽说话，我感到笑容在脸上蔓延开来。虽然她成为完全的人类才不过几年，但在这短短的时间里，她已经成长了许多。她变得成熟，必要时能提供深刻的见解。很多时候，和她交谈时，我都会忘记自己应该是那个成年人。

Yet I am still concerned about this whole thing and I can tell from the frown on her face that she is too.  
然而，我对这一切仍然感到担忧，从她皱眉的表情中，我可以看出她也有同样的感受。

"I still don't know Rei… but you are right, I… can't control what Shinji does and he has to make his own mind up on these things. I don't want to push him to do anything he doesn't want to and I don't want to stop him doing things he wants to… within reason of course."  
“我还是不太明白，丽……但你是对的，我……无法控制真嗣的行为，他必须自己决定这些事情。我不想强迫他做任何他不愿意做的事，也不想阻止他做他想做的事……当然是在合理的范围内。”

"I understand and I promise…" Rei turns to look at me, "Should Shinji make that request and this happen, I will ensure Nagisa does not have the opportunity to hurt my brother again."  
"我明白，我承诺……" 丽转向我，"如果真嗣提出那个请求，事情变成这样，我会确保渚薰不会再有机会伤害我的弟弟。"

**Kaworu Nagisa. 渚薰。**

"No." I look at Asuka as she shakes her head, "You don't understand, at least… you think you do. Earlier today I wrote an e-mail, a lengthy e-mail talking about a lot of things. I was going to send it to Shinji."  
"不。" 我看向明日香，她摇着头说，"你不明白，至少……你以为你明白。今天早些时候我写了一封电子邮件，一封长邮件，谈了很多事情。我本来打算发给真嗣的。"

"Oh… I see." I try to hide the disappointment I'm feeling at hearing her say those words but I do a poor job of it. I can feel my shoulders lower and my gaze go to the table as I mumble out a reply, "I understand."  
"哦… 我明白了。" 我试图掩饰听到她那番话后的失望，但做得并不好。我能感觉到自己的肩膀下垂，目光转向桌子，喃喃地回答，"我懂了。"

"I don't know why I wrote it, I just… I guess since you arrived I've been thinking about certain things and maybe I felt it was time to get back in contact with them. In it I was going to tell them everything, why I left the way I did and why I've had no contact. I was going to tell them about being friends with Rei and explain that to them and I was also going to tell them about my meeting you."  
"我不知道为什么写这封信，我只是… 自从你来了之后，我一直在想一些事情，也许我觉得是时候重新联系他们了。在信里，我打算告诉他们一切，我为什么那样离开，为什么一直没联系。我打算告诉他们我和丽成为朋友的事，并向他们解释，我还要告诉他们遇见你的事。"

I pause as I process what she is saying. I suppose that perhaps I should have expected this event to eventually take place. I am not ignorant to her feelings for Shinji nor am I ignorant of his feelings for her. When I spent time with Shinji so long ago he would speak of Asuka fondly and told me he was scared of what would happen to her.  
我停顿了一下，思考她的话。我想也许我本该预料到这件事终会发生。我对她对真嗣的感情并不无知，对真嗣对她的感情也一样。很久以前我和真嗣相处时，他会深情地谈起明日香，并告诉我他害怕她会发生什么。

When Asuka has spoken to me of Shinji I can see the emotion in her eyes. I can't sense the feelings in her heart but I know they are there. I have always known and yet I still feel this strange sensation of disappointment within me. I feel this tightening in my chest and lump in my throat.  
当明日香向我谈起真嗣时，我能从她的眼中看到情感的流露。我虽无法感知她内心的感受，但我知道它们确实存在。我一直都知道，然而内心仍有一种莫名的失望感。胸口紧绷，喉咙哽咽。

Finally I am able to speak again, I try to sound as normal as possible, "Why could you not send it?"  
终于，我又能开口说话了，我尽量保持语气的平常，"为什么你没能发送出去？"

Asuka shrugs her shoulders, "I don't know… I just couldn't. I read through it a few times and it seemed fine but I could couldn't bring myself to click send. I guess…"  
明日香耸了耸肩，"我不知道……我就是做不到。我读了几遍，感觉没问题，但就是无法让自己点击发送。我想……"

She sighs, "I'm an idiot, I guess all my life I wanted independence and to prove I could do things on my own but when it comes to something like this I want approval first. I wanted to tell Rei and… I wanted to tell you about it first."  
她叹了口气，“我想我是个傻瓜，一直以来我都渴望独立，证明自己能独自完成事情，但遇到这种事时，我却首先想要得到认可。我想先告诉丽和……我想先告诉你。”

As strange as it sounds my heart lightens ever so slightly at hearing her say she wanted my approval first. I listen to her as she continues, "Damn thing involves you so I guess it was only right you were told just in case something happened. Not that it would, I'd make sure of that."  
虽然听起来很奇怪，但听到她说她首先想要我的认可，我的心稍稍轻松了一些。我听着她继续说，“这事儿牵扯到你，所以我想告诉你也是应该的，以防万一发生什么。不过不会的，我会确保那不会发生。”

"Yeah…" “是啊……”

"Anyway I… I tried to phone Rei this afternoon but it wasn't her who answered the phone. It was Shinji…"  
"总之我……我今天下午试着给丽打电话，但接电话的不是她。是真嗣……"

My head snaps upwards and I lock my eyes firmly onto Asuka on hearing her say that. That terrible feeling of fear creeps into me once again, "You… You spoke to him?"  
我猛地抬起头，目光坚定地锁定在明日香身上，听到她这么说。那种可怕的恐惧感再次悄悄侵袭我，“你……你跟他说话了吗？”

"No. No I didn't." Asuka shakes her head and I see a small smile come to her lips, "I heard his voice and I kept silent. Eventually I just hung up and then not long afterwards you called me to arrange this."  
"没有。我没有。" 明日香摇摇头，我看到她嘴角露出一丝微笑，"我听到他的声音就保持沉默了。最后我只是挂了电话，然后没过多久你就打电话给我安排这个了。"

"So that is the reason you did not seem alright on the phone?" I ask her.  
"所以这就是你电话里听起来不太对劲的原因？" 我问她。

"Exactly." She tells me, "It put me in something of a bad place. Maybe I should have told you this on the phone, it might have made things easier. When I came here tonight I still felt awful and… what you had done was so nice it just overwhelmed me. I'm sorry I ruined it, you must have spent a lot of time planning it and I've not exactly been the guest you anticipated."  
"正是。" 她告诉我，"这让我心情很糟糕。也许我本该在电话里告诉你，那样可能会让事情简单些。今晚我来这里时，仍然感觉很糟，而你所做的一切是那么贴心，让我完全无法承受。对不起，我搞砸了，你一定花了很多时间策划这一切，而我显然不是你预期的那位客人。"

I admit I am somewhat lost for words when she finishes speaking. I know I have to say something to her to reassure her. I need to tell her that just her being here and sharing a meal with me is more than enough for me to be happy. Yet I do not feel happy right now, I don't know what I feel really, it's a mixture.  
她讲完后，我承认自己有些语塞。我知道我得说些什么来安慰她。我需要告诉她，仅仅是她在这里与我共进晚餐，就足以让我感到无比幸福。然而此刻我并不觉得快乐，我真的不知道自己是什么感觉，复杂得很。

I feel afraid, afraid that the moment I have known will happen eventually but tried to avoid could happen soon and I am in no way ready for it. I feel embarrassed, embarrassed that I allowed myself to get carried away with my feelings for Asuka knowing what I do about her. I also feel ashamed at myself for thinking about her in such a way, when I should have been happy with the friendship I have.  
我感到害怕，害怕那个我明知终将发生却一直试图逃避的时刻可能很快就会到来，而我却毫无准备。我感到尴尬，尴尬的是我明知自己对明日香的感情，却还是放任自己沉溺其中。我也为自己以这种方式思念她而感到羞愧，毕竟我本应满足于我们之间的友谊。

I muster up as much of a smile as I can, "It is okay Asuka, I apologize that this seemed to coincide with such an event. If I had known this than I would not have…"  
我尽力挤出一个微笑，“没事的，明日香，我很抱歉这似乎与这样一个事件巧合了。如果我早知道的话，我就不会……”

"No please… Don't you dare apologize, you had no idea and this is… I really appreciate all of this." Asuka interrupts me, "This food… it's delicious and you are… well… never mind."  
“不，请别……你千万别道歉，你毫不知情，而且这……我真的非常感激这一切。”明日香打断了我，“这些食物……非常美味，而你……嗯……算了。”

I watch as she shakes her head and lowers her eyes, a moment later I too go back to staring at my empty plate. We both fall silent as I try to think of something to say to her. What has happened tonight is not the way that I had perhaps hoped it would. I don't really know what grand ideas I had in my head, ones perhaps influenced by romantic media and conversation. A fantasy where she would come over and jump into my arms.  
我看着她摇摇头，垂下眼帘，片刻后我也回到了盯着空盘子的状态。我们都陷入了沉默，我试图想出一些话对她说。今晚发生的一切并非我所期望的方式。我不太清楚自己脑海中那些宏大的想法是什么，或许受到了浪漫媒体和对话的影响。幻想中她会走过来，跳进我的怀里。

I realize how ridiculous that sounds though. In trying to work out my own feelings I had allowed my mind to wander down those paths. I allowed it to conjure up a fantasy where I would impress Asuka and by the end of the night confess my feelings. She would be impressed and confess hers and we would be… something.  
然而，我意识到这听起来多么荒谬。在努力理清自己的感情时，我让自己的思绪沿着那些路径游走。我允许它构建出一个幻想，在那里我会给明日香留下深刻印象，并在夜晚结束时表白我的感情。她会被打动，也表白她的感情，我们就会……成为某种关系。

Another silent minute passes us by as I continue to struggle for something to say to her. Everything I can think of now sounds ridiculous in comparison to what she has just told me. A part of me doesn't wish to talk about any of it. Perhaps it is selfish on my part but I am too scared to know why she made that sudden decision and too scared to speak about it further. What exactly am I scared of? Losing my friendship with her? Confirmation that my feelings are not reciprocated? I don't know, I'm just scared.  
又是一分钟悄然流逝，我仍在努力寻找话题与她交谈。此刻我想到的任何话，与她刚刚告诉我的事情相比，都显得荒谬可笑。我内心的一部分并不想谈论这些。或许这是我的自私，但我害怕知道她为何突然做出那个决定，也害怕进一步讨论。我究竟在害怕什么？失去与她的友谊？确认我的感情没有得到回应？我不知道，我只是害怕。

"Would you like me to leave?" Asuka finally speaks after another long and silent minute passes us by.  
“你想让我离开吗？”在又一段漫长的沉默之后，明日香终于开口问道。

I look up at her and shake my head, "N-No… Please, I would like you to stay, if you would like to of course. I am sorry for my silence I am just… finding it difficult to find appropriate words to say right now."  
我抬头看着她，摇了摇头，“不……请留下来，如果你愿意的话。对不起，我沉默了，只是……现在很难找到合适的话来说。”

I take in a deep breath and try to think things over one more time. I think about all Asuka has told me since I met her. How she vanished from their lives the way she did and how Rei was the one who found her. It is not hard for me to see that Asuka would perhaps be happier if she were to re-establish those bonds with those people. I would wish to see Asuka happy above all else so I should encourage that, should I not?  
我深吸一口气，试图再次仔细思考。自从遇见明日香以来，她告诉我的所有事情都在我脑海中回响。她如何突然从他们的生活中消失，又是如何被绫波找到的。不难看出，如果明日香能与那些人重建联系，她或许会更快乐。我希望看到明日香幸福，这是最重要的，所以我应该鼓励她这样做，不是吗？

I'm unable to bring myself to say anything yet. Instead I just look dumbly towards the kitchen and then back towards Asuka. I don't wish for Asuka to leave but I can sense her discomfort for being here, perhaps if I gave her the opportunity she could leave.  
我仍无法让自己说出任何话。我只是呆呆地望向厨房，然后又回头看向明日香。我不希望明日香离开，但我能感觉到她在这里的不适，也许如果我给她机会，她就能离开。

"I will go and get dessert. I made us ice cream, I hope you enjoy it as much as you did the steak."  
“我去拿甜点。我给咱们做了冰淇淋，希望你能像喜欢牛排一样喜欢它。”

I get up from my seat and wander over to the kitchen keeping my back turned. I crouch and open the freeze and put one hand in and on the tub of ice cream. Once there I wait for the inevitable to happen. Sure enough after a few seconds of waiting I hear the sound of Asuka getting up off of her chair. I close my eyes and listen for the sound of my door closing.  
我从座位上起身，背对着她走向厨房。我蹲下打开冰箱，伸手去拿那桶冰淇淋。在那里，我等待着不可避免的事情发生。果然，几秒钟后，我听到了明日香从椅子上站起来的声音。我闭上眼睛，等待着我的房门关闭的声音。

After thirty seconds I become confused when the sound doesn't come. I finally open my eyes and hear her voice, "Kaworu… Are you alright? You've been crouched there for a minute?"  
三十秒过去了，声音仍未出现，我感到困惑。最终，我睁开眼睛，听到了她的声音，“薰…你还好吗？你已经在那儿蹲了一分钟了？”

Her voice startles me and I jump in fright, pulling the tub of ice cream out of the freezer and knocking myself off balance, I land on the solid floor with a thud. Feeling somewhat embarrassed I slowly get up and turn to see her stood in the kitchen, "A-Asuka I thought you… I heard you get up and thought you had left."  
她的声音吓了我一跳，我惊慌失措地跳了起来，手中的冰淇淋桶从冰箱里被拽出，我失去了平衡，重重地摔在了坚硬的地板上。感到有些尴尬，我慢慢站起身，转身看到她站在厨房里，“明日香，我以为你…我听到你站起来，以为你已经离开了。”

"Idiot…" She chuckles, "I was coming to see if you needed any help. It's the least I could do for fucking your night up."  
"傻瓜…" 她轻笑道，"我是来看看你是否需要帮忙。打扰了你的夜晚，这是我起码能做的。"

"Oh…" I feel myself blush at her words as I clutch the tub of ice cream to my chest, "Then can… bowls…. Two please?"  
"哦…" 听到她的话，我感到脸颊发烫，紧紧抱住怀里的冰淇淋桶，"那可以…碗…两个，请吗？"

She nods and pulls two bowls out of a nearby cupboard and sets them down on the counter top. I place the tub of ice cream down near to them and reach into the drawer to retrieve the ice cream scoop I purchased. Before I'm able to find it I feel Asuka's hand on my wrist as she gently pulls it out of the drawer.  
她点点头，从附近的橱柜里拿出两个碗，放在台面上。我把冰淇淋桶放在它们旁边，伸手去抽屉里拿我买的冰淇淋勺。还没等我找到，就感觉到明日香的手放在我的手腕上，她轻轻地从抽屉里拉出勺子。

"Asuka what are you-" "Asuka 你在干什么-"

"Shut up." She commands me, "For just a moment there is something…"  
"闭嘴。" 她命令我，"就一会儿，有件事…"

She takes both of my wrists and guides me to the centre of my kitchen. I feel myself blush as her warm hands envelop my wrists and she looks into my eyes. She opens her mouth to say something but immediately closes it before shaking her head, "Kaworu can you… close your eyes for a moment please?"  
她握住我的双腕，带我到厨房中央。我感到脸颊发烫，她的温暖手掌包裹着我的手腕，她凝视着我的眼睛。她张开嘴想说些什么，但立刻又闭上了，摇了摇头，"Kaworu 你能…闭上眼睛一会儿吗？"

"Why?" I ask. "为什么？" 我问道。

"Just do it, please…" "请就这样做吧…"

I comply with the request and close my eyes completely unsure of what is to come next. The instant I shut them I feel her hands tighten around my wrists and I can sense her taking a step forward.  
我顺从了请求，完全不确定接下来会发生什么，闭上了眼睛。就在我闭上眼的那一刻，我感觉到她的双手紧紧握住我的手腕，我能感觉到她向前迈了一步。

"Kaworu…" I hear her speak, "I'm going to say something to you and I want you to listen to me and not say anything until I'm done, is that okay?"  
"渚薰……" 我听到她说话，"我要对你说些话，我希望你听我说完，不要插嘴，好吗？"

I nod. 我点点头。

"Good." She pauses for a moment, "I probably made a mistake by agreeing to come here tonight after what happened but… despite that I am glad I came. If anything it… and you and what you did earlier has… confirmed something I guess. Something I've been thinking about for a while."  
"很好。" 她停顿了一下，"我可能犯了个错误，同意今晚来这里，毕竟发生了那样的事……但尽管如此，我很高兴我来了。如果说有什么意义的话，那……你和你之前所做的……证实了一些事情，我想。一些我已经思考了一段时间的事情。"

I open my mouth to ask her what that thing is but immediately close it remembering her instruction from earlier.  
我张嘴想问她那东西是什么，但立刻又闭上了，想起了她之前的指示。

"I made some mistakes today but what I'm about to do… I'm certain this isn't a mistake."  
“今天我犯了一些错误，但我即将要做的事……我确信这不是一个错误。”

I feel her move forward again and then a brief moment later I feel a heat near to my face, close to my right cheek. Then a second later there is a softness that makes contact with my cheek. Almost instantly I open my eyes and see her moving her head away from me. She glares at me, "I thought I told you to keep your eyes closed!"  
我感觉到她再次向前移动，紧接着不久，我感到脸颊右侧附近传来一阵热意。然后一秒钟后，一种柔软触感轻触我的脸颊。我几乎立刻睁开眼睛，看到她正从我面前移开头部。她瞪着我，“我以为我告诉过你闭上眼睛！”

I open my mouth awkwardly, "A-Asuka I…"  
我尴尬地张开嘴，“A-明日香，我…”

I don't quite know what to make of what has just happened. Did Asuka really just do what I think she did? If so what does that mean? What do I do now? How do I respond to that? I stand there dumbly as she continues to glare at me. I can no longer speak but it seems to don't need to. Her glare softens, and she moves forward again.  
我不是很明白刚刚发生了什么。明日香真的做了我认为她做的事吗？如果是的话那意味着什么？我现在该怎么办？我该如何回应？我呆呆地站在那里，她继续瞪着我。我再也说不出话来，但似乎也不需要了。她的目光变得柔和，再次向前迈进。

"I was right, that wasn't a mistake."  
“我猜对了，那不是个错误。”

This time my cheek is not the target and I'm ready for it. She presses her lips up against my own and my instincts take over. I bring my hands up and place them slowly and carefully on her back. I respond by trying to return the kiss as best I can. I can feel her arms come up and wrap themselves around me and we stand there for over a minute of blissful silence.  
这次我的脸颊不再是目标，我已做好准备。她将双唇紧贴在我的唇上，我的本能随即接管。我抬起双手，缓慢而谨慎地放在她的背上。我尽力回应，试图以最好的方式回吻。我能感觉到她的手臂抬起，环绕着我，我们就这样在幸福的静谧中站立了超过一分钟。

### Chapter 8: A Story Never Told  
第八章：未曾讲述的故事  

**14****th** **September 2021** 2021 年 9 月 14 日

**Asuka Langley Soryu – Early Morning  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 —— 清晨时分**

**Kaworu's Apartment 渚薰的公寓**

I slowly open my eyes to be greeted by the slightest slither of light coming in through the curtains. It's funny in a way but this sofa and this room is actually starting to feel like a second home to me. The first night I spent here had been uncomfortable, I've always struggled with sleep as it is never mind in an unfamiliar home and on a sofa but now I'm starting to feel slightly comfortable waking up here. Maybe I should leave some things here for the next time.  
我缓缓睁开眼，迎接我的是透过窗帘缝隙的一丝微光。说来也怪，这张沙发和这个房间竟开始让我觉得像第二个家了。第一晚在这里过夜时还很不舒服，我本就难以入睡，更别提在陌生的家中、在沙发上了，但现在醒来时却感到些许自在。或许下次来时，我该留下些东西。

I have to laugh at that strange thought. Only yesterday I was considering cutting off all contact with Kaworu. I was considering running away and never seeing him again, an effort to protect him from me. Or maybe it was just an effort to try to make sure I'm unhappy like I seem to feel I should be.  
想到这个奇怪的念头，我不禁笑出声来。就在昨天，我还考虑过与渚薰断绝所有联系。我曾想过逃离，再也不见他，只为保护他免受我的影响。又或许，这只是我试图确保自己像我认为应该感到的那样不快乐。

When I agreed to go to dinner with him I didn't think it'd be like it was, I didn't think he'd have cooked. I thought it'd be a matter of going out to dinner and then saying goodnight. It wasn't his fault but him going to that effort triggered something inside of me, that voice that tells me I'm horrible and don't deserve anything nice, certain not all that Kaworu had done for me. I so very nearly fucked up the night by listening to that voice. Still even without the voice I didn't think I'd have ended up staying the night, nor did I think I'd have kissed him.  
当我答应和他共进晚餐时，我没想到会是那样，没想到他会亲自下厨。我原以为只是出去吃个饭，然后道声晚安。这并非他的错，但他如此用心却触动了我内心某个角落，那个声音告诉我，我是个糟糕的人，不配拥有任何美好，更别提 Kaworu 为我所做的一切。我差点就因为听信那个声音而搞砸了那个夜晚。即便没有那个声音，我也从未想过会留宿，更没想到会吻他。

The kiss, was wonderful, awkward but I suppose that is to be expected. It would have been Kaworu's first kiss after all and I'm not exactly massively experienced in that department either. My first kiss was with Shinji and I don't need to go over how much of a disaster that was again. I've never really been one for too much kissing since then. It's always been something of a means to an end, just something to get the blood flowing but little emotion/passion in there.  
那个吻，美妙而尴尬，但我想这是可以预料的。毕竟这可能是 Kaworu 的初吻，而我在这方面也并非经验丰富。我的初吻是和 Shinji，无需赘述那场灾难有多严重。自那以后，我并不热衷于接吻。它总是被当作达到目的的手段，只是为了激发血液流动，而缺乏情感或激情。

Kissing in a certain way always seemed to be romantic to me, something you'd save for the person you love. Thing about having a one-night stand is that both of you don't really care about love and romance, you're there for a brief bit of fun and then you move on and never see them again. So of the two encounters I've had sticking to the no/little kissing rule has been quite easy.  
以某种方式接吻对我来说总是显得很浪漫，是留给心爱之人的特别之举。一夜情的问题在于，双方并不真正在意爱情和浪漫，只是为了短暂的乐趣，然后各自前行，再不相见。所以在我经历过的两次中，坚持不接吻或少接吻的原则相当容易。

What wasn't as easy was stemming those feelings of guilt and the voices telling me how horrible I am for a few days afterwards. I don't know what else I expected to happen though. I mean I am me after all. I can barely even please myself without feeling guilty afterwards so what did I expect when someone else is involved?  
更难的是抑制那些事后几天的内疚感和指责我有多糟糕的声音。不过，我也不知道自己还期待什么。毕竟，我就是我。连让自己开心后都感到内疚，更别提牵扯到别人时我会期待什么了。

I don't feel strange nor do I feel any guilt about kissing Kaworu though. What happened last night was something I wanted to do, something that felt right to do and something that made me feel good and I'm damn sure it made him feel good too. Thinking about the kiss is actually making me smile, I can still feel Kaworu's soft lips on mine and him holding me gently in his arms.  
不过，我对亲吻渚薰既不感到奇怪，也没有任何内疚。昨晚发生的事是我想要做的，感觉对了，也让我感觉很好，我敢肯定他也感觉很好。一想到那个吻，我就忍不住微笑，我仍能感受到渚薰柔软的唇瓣和他在我怀中温柔的拥抱。

Despite being inexperienced he seems to have eased into it fairly quickly. We kissed for what must have been well over a minute, both of us stood there holding one another peacefully. At no point did Kaworu try to overstep any boundaries. I suppose that was probably down to Kaworu not really knowing what to do and maybe a bit of fear of any retaliation from me.  
尽管缺乏经验，他似乎很快就适应了。我们接吻了足有一分钟之久，两人静静地站在那里相拥。Kaworu 没有试图越界。我想这大概是因为 Kaworu 不太知道该怎么做，或许还有点害怕我会反击。

I did sense some awkwardness from him after we finished kissing, both of us wondering what to do next. I could see the embarrassment in Kaworu's face and also feel that his body clearly seemed to have an idea of what he wanted to do next but I decided to not draw attention to that. Instead I backed away slowly and allowed him to settle down before asking him to finish preparing the ice cream.  
接吻结束后，我感觉到他有些尴尬，我们都在想接下来该做什么。我能看到 Kaworu 脸上的尴尬，也能感觉到他的身体显然知道他下一步想做什么，但我决定不去注意这一点。相反，我慢慢后退，让他平静下来，然后请他继续准备冰淇淋。

We didn't sit at his dining table for the ice cream, instead we sat on the couch and put on a concert DVD he had bought. We had a spoon each and managed to finish off the entire tub before the concert had finished. The ice cream, for the record, was just as delicious as the main meal was.  
我们没有坐在餐桌旁吃冰淇淋，而是坐在沙发上，放了他买的音乐会 DVD。我们每人一把勺子，在音乐会结束前就把整桶冰淇淋吃完了。值得一提的是，这冰淇淋和主餐一样美味。

Shortly afterwards we realized just how late it was and instead of me getting a taxi back Kaworu asked if I would like to stay the night. I agreed and he brought out some sheets and pillows for me to sleep on the sofa. A part of me considered asking to sleep in his bed but I held back, maybe that'd be a step too far for the moment.  
不久之后，我们意识到时间已经很晚了，于是 Kaworu 提议我是否愿意留宿一晚，而不是打车回家。我同意了，他拿出一些床单和枕头让我睡在沙发上。我心里有一部分在考虑是否要请求睡在他的床上，但我忍住了，也许那对目前来说太过分了。

In addition there were things I wanted to think about. A vast number of questions started to enter my head. What exactly are me and Kaworu now? Are we boyfriend and girlfriend? I do like him, I've already admitted that to myself and I wouldn't have kissed him if I didn't but I still wonder about him. Does he like me because I'm the first person to reach out to him? If he does then how far will this go?  
此外，我还有许多事情需要思考。大量的问题开始涌入我的脑海。我和 Kaworu 现在到底是什么关系？我们是男女朋友吗？我确实喜欢他，我已经向自己承认了这一点，如果不是喜欢他，我就不会吻他。但我仍然对他感到好奇。他喜欢我是因为我是第一个向他伸出援手的人吗？如果是这样，这段关系会走多远？

I have other things to think about too. I was going to contact Shinji yesterday, I was going to speak to Rei as well but now this has happened. Do I explain this to her? Do I tell Shinji? Will Kaworu want me to contact Shinji and tell him? What will those two think about this? In a way I know it's none of their business but I know how tangled the web is between the four of us and I'm sick of it.  
我还有其他事情需要考虑。我原本打算昨天联系真嗣，也想和绫波谈谈，但现在这一切发生了。我需要向她解释吗？我应该告诉真嗣吗？Kaworu 会希望我联系真嗣并告诉他吗？那两个人会怎么想这件事？从某种程度上我知道这不关他们的事，但我知道我们四个人之间的关系错综复杂，我对此感到厌倦。

I know with a few words I can start untangling that web but I don't want to hurt people, least of all Shinji. I don't want this web to be so tangled anymore.  
我知道只需几句话就能开始解开那团乱麻，但我不想伤害任何人，尤其是真嗣。我不希望这团乱麻再纠缠不清了。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

It's morning and I have been awake for at least an hour but have not yet gotten out of my bed. Instead I've been lying here with my mind wandering through a maze of thoughts about last night and questions about me, my past and who I am and was.  
天已破晓，我至少醒了一个小时，却仍未离开床铺。相反，我躺在这里，思绪在关于昨晚和关于我、我的过去以及我是谁、曾经是谁的迷宫中游走。

Thoughts of last night echo prominently in my mind for the moment. Asuka... Last night she kissed me and it was such a wonderful thing. It was astonishing. In fact, I don't think I can find an adjective suitable to sum up the experience.  
昨晚的思绪此刻在我脑海中回响。明日香……昨晚她吻了我，那感觉如此美妙。令人惊叹。事实上，我觉得找不到一个合适的形容词来概括那种体验。

Yet, despite how wonderful the experience was I still feel an amount of trepidation about the whole thing. I worry that despite my enjoyment of it that it might not have been as good for Asuka. I question if perhaps I should have done more during the kiss, I wonder if she was expecting me to do more or even if I might have done too much when I held her. I even question If I was any good at kissing her.  
然而，尽管这次经历如此美妙，我心中仍有一丝忐忑。我担心尽管我乐在其中，但对明日香来说可能并不那么美好。我怀疑自己是否在接吻时做得不够，她是否期待我做更多，或者我抱着她时是否做得过火了。我甚至怀疑自己吻她时是否做得好。

In addition, there was one other slight problem I experienced whilst kissing her. It's an issue that I've only had to deal with when on my own and never in the company of another person. Being kissed and held by her in such away aroused me and to be in that state in front of another person was embarrassing. I don't know if Asuka noticed it, I hope that she didn't, she didn't call attention to it if she did but regardless it was not a comfortable experience.  
此外，在吻她时我还遇到了一个小问题。这是一个我独自一人时才会遇到的问题，从未在他人面前经历过。被她那样亲吻和拥抱，让我感到兴奋，而在别人面前处于这种状态实在令人尴尬。我不知道明日香是否注意到了，我希望她没有，即使她注意到了也没有提及，但无论如何，那都不是一次舒适的体验。

If anything, to have my body betray me in such a way was humbling and slightly terrifying. I was aware that the human body does respond in such a way but I didn't expect to happen to quickly and it to feel like it did. In truth, it scared me and I worry that if I felt awkward in that situation how would I feel if it had progressed further?  
如果说有什么让我感到意外，那就是我的身体以这种方式背叛了我，既令人谦卑又略带恐怖。我知道人体确实会以这种方式反应，但我没料到会这么快发生，并且感觉如此强烈。事实上，这让我感到害怕，我担心如果我在那种情况下都感到尴尬，那么情况进一步发展时我又会有何感受？

It was further confirmation that I am definitely not the same Kaworu of years ago. Arousal was not something I felt in that form and unlike now I did not have any qualms back then about being naked in front of others. For me the body I inhabited was little more than an instrument to carry me forward into the next form.  
这进一步证实了我绝非多年前的那位渚薰。在那个形态下，我从未感受过性欲，而且与现在不同，那时我并不介意在别人面前赤身裸体。对我来说，我所占据的身体不过是一个将我带入下一个形态的工具罢了。

Now however my body is so much more and I am aware of it in ways that I wasn't before. I am aware of how it looks, I am aware of how it feels, I am aware of size and of my differences. I have found myself comparing my body to others and understanding how I am different to them. To describe it best, previously I was inhabiting a body but it felt more like my consciousness was merely floating above it. Perhaps not too dissimilar to how Asuka or Shinji would feel in an Evangelion. Now I feel that I am as one with my body, both myself and it are in sync.  
如今，我的身体变得如此丰富，我以从前未曾有过的方式感知它。我意识到它的外观，感受到它的触感，察觉到尺寸与差异。我发现自己开始将身体与他人比较，理解我们之间的不同。最贴切的描述或许是，过去我只是居住在一个身体里，但我的意识仿佛只是漂浮其上。或许与明日香或真嗣在 EVA 中的感受相差无几。现在，我感到自己与身体融为一体，自我与它同步一致。

With this heightened awareness also comes feelings of guilt with how I might have acted towards others and how I might have made them uncomfortable. I can now understand the awkwardness that Shinji Ikari felt around me many years ago when I spoke to him and when I walked around naked in front of him. I remember finding it curious how he blushed and averted his eyes when in the showers with him. When he flinched as I touched his hand and panicked as I asked him to go to bed.  
随着这种增强的意识，也带来了对过去可能对他人行为感到的内疚，以及可能让他们感到不适的反思。我现在能理解多年前真嗣一护在我身边时的尴尬，当我与他交谈，或在他面前赤身裸体走动时。我记得当时觉得奇怪，他在淋浴间里脸红避开视线。当我触碰他的手时他畏缩，当我要求他上床时他惊慌失措。

I understand why he was awkward now and Shinji, if I could see you again then I would say that I am sorry for that. I understand now and I did not mean to make you uncomfortable. If I had known then what I know now I would not have acted the way I did at all.  
我现在明白他为何显得笨拙了，真嗣，如果我能再次见到你，我会说对不起。我现在明白了，无意让你感到不适。如果当时我知道现在所知的一切，我绝不会那样行事。

I angrily shake my head at that last thought, if I had known then what I know now? That was the point wasn't it? That was why SEELE treated and raised me the way they did so that I wouldn't act any differently. They kept me in such a state so that I would push forward to try to wipe out this world and betray my first friend in such a way without hesitation. They were responsible for who I was!  
对于那个最后的念头，我愤怒地摇了摇头，如果当时我知道现在所知的一切？这就是关键所在，不是吗？这就是为什么 SEELE 那样对待和抚养我，以免我行为有所不同。他们让我保持那种状态，以便我毫不犹豫地推动毁灭这个世界，背叛我的第一个朋友。他们要为我是谁负责！

Yes I am sorry for what I did. Yes, maybe I could have acted differently and I accept that ultimately my actions were my own but I am not blameless in this scenario. It is not a matter of if I ever saw Shinji again I would apologize but a matter of when. I can't help but feel our meeting is inevitable and when that time comes I know I will be terrified but I will face him and apologize for my actions.  
是的，我为我所做的事感到抱歉。是的，也许我可以有不同的行为，我承认最终我的行动是我自己的选择，但我在这件事上并非无辜。这不是如果我再次见到真嗣我会道歉，而是何时。我无法不觉得我们的相遇是不可避免的，当那一刻到来时，我知道我会害怕，但我会面对他，为我的行为道歉。

The idea of that meeting does frighten me somewhat. I know not how such a thing would happen but after Asuka informing me last night of her desire to re-establish contact with him I know it will. These thoughts in turn bring me back to the kiss last night. I wonder what this means for me and Asuka going forward, I wonder what we are to one another? Are we a couple now? Will this go further or will she discover she made a mistake and say that this can't go further?  
那个会面的念头确实让我有些害怕。我不知道这样的事情是如何发生的，但自从昨晚明日香告诉我她想与他重新建立联系后，我知道这必将发生。这些思绪又让我回想起昨晚的那个吻。我不知道这对我和明日香的未来意味着什么，我们彼此之间究竟算什么？我们现在是一对了吗？这段关系会进一步发展，还是她会发现这是个错误，然后说这不能再继续下去了？

I wonder what I am to Asuka? I know she has feelings to Shinji, that much is obvious so if she were to re-establish contact with him then what would that mean for me? Is what we might have only temporary and should I therefore enjoy it whilst I can?  
我不知道我在明日香心中算什么？我知道她对真嗣有感情，这一点很明显，所以如果她决定与他重新联系，那对我来说意味着什么？我们可能拥有的关系只是暂时的吗？我是否应该趁现在享受它？

I have so many questions and lying here is only causing me to go in circles thinking about them. Perhaps I should just get up and see what the day brings.  
我有太多问题，躺在这里只会让我陷入无休止的思考循环。也许我应该起床，看看今天会带来什么。

**Rei Ayanami  绫波零**

**Emergence Facility Café 紧急设施咖啡馆**

As I enter the cafeteria I feel my phone vibrate inside my handbag. I stop for a moment to take my phone out and check the message. As I both thought and hoped the message is from Asuka and I quickly open it to check the contents.  
当我走进食堂时，我感觉到手机在我的手提包里震动。我停了一会儿，拿出手机查看消息。正如我所想并希望的那样，消息来自明日香，我迅速打开它查看内容。

_'Hi Rei, everything is fine here, there is nothing for you to worry about. I will contact you later, I have something I want you to look at and give me advice on. Also, I'm sorry about what happened with Shinji yesterday, I didn't think he would pick up. I hope I didn't cause any trouble for you.'  
'嗨，绫波，这里一切都好，没什么让你担心的。我稍后会联系你，有件事我想让你看看并给我一些建议。另外，对于昨天和真嗣发生的事情，我很抱歉，我没想到他会接电话。希望我没有给你带来麻烦。'_

I can't help but feel there is something slightly strange about the message Asuka has sent me, in fact there are two strange things about the message. I read through it once more for confirmation. First of all, Asuka is asking me for advice on something. That is extremely rare, if anything I'm usually the one asking her for advice where possible, especially in the earlier stages of our friendship when I was still discovering certain things.  
我不禁觉得明日香发给我的这条信息有些奇怪，实际上，这条信息有两处不寻常。我又仔细读了一遍以确认。首先，明日香在向我寻求建议。这种情况极为罕见，通常都是我尽可能向她请教，尤其是在我们友谊初期，我还在探索某些事情的时候。

Secondly Asuka has called Shinji by his name. Come to think of it she did a similar thing the last time we spoke but it didn't register properly in my mind. Perhaps I thought it was a simple slip of the tongue or she didn't realize due to other circumstances. This however, this had to have been deliberate. Which of course makes me curious.  
其次，明日香直接称呼了真嗣的名字。回想起来，上次我们交谈时她也有类似的行为，但当时我并未在意。也许我当时以为那只是口误，或是由于其他情况她没有意识到。但这次，这肯定是故意的。这自然让我感到好奇。

Asuka has not said Shinji's name in a very long time, it is a fact that makes me quite sad that my best friend is unable to speak my brother's name. At the same time, I am also saddened by the fact that my brother is unable to speak by best friend's name. I don't know why the two of them are like this, perhaps it was a way to shield themselves from some sort of pain. Either way they have not mentioned one another's by name for a few years.  
明日香已经很久没有叫过真嗣的名字了，这让我感到非常难过，因为我最好的朋友无法说出我哥哥的名字。同时，我也为我的哥哥无法说出我最好朋友的名字而感到悲伤。我不知道他们为什么会这样，也许这是一种保护自己免受某种痛苦的方式。无论如何，他们已经有好几年没有互相提及对方的名字了。

I wonder then what has caused Asuka to suddenly start to speak Shinji's name again, not only in this message but in our conversation a couple of weeks ago. I wonder if there is some significance to her doing this. Almost immediately I wonder if maybe this is a sign that she is ready to come back and see us all again. I would like that so much  
那么，是什么让明日香突然又开始叫真嗣的名字了呢？不仅在这条消息中，还有几周前我们的对话里。我想知道她这样做是否有某种意义。我几乎立刻想到，这可能是一个迹象，表明她已经准备好回来见我们大家了。我非常希望如此。

Unfortunately, I am unable to find out the reasoning at the moment in time. I have a reason for being here and it would be bad of me to suddenly leave. I put my phone away and slowly walk towards one of the many free tables in the cafeteria. As I walk I can feel the eyes of the few people in the facility on me, I wonder if they are looking at me because of what I look like or because I'm one of the few people to pass through here in quite some time.  
遗憾的是，我目前无法查明其中的缘由。我来到这里是有原因的，突然离开会显得我不够负责。我将手机收起，缓缓走向食堂里众多空桌中的一张。行走间，我能感觉到设施内寥寥数人的目光落在我身上，我不禁疑惑，他们是因为我的外貌而注视我，还是因为我是这里许久未见的来客之一。

I sit myself down and start to observe. There are so very few people here, at one point this place might have dealt with a hundred or so people emerging from instrumentality a week. Now I believe it is barely any, in fact aside from Nagisa I don't know if there have been any people emerge in the past year. It is my understanding that he was the first person they had recovered in quite some time.  
我坐下开始观察四周。这里的人实在太少了，曾经这个地方每周可能有上百人从一体化中苏醒。如今，我相信人数已寥寥无几，事实上，除了渚之外，我不确定过去一年里还有没有其他人苏醒。据我所知，他是他们很久以来第一个恢复的人。

I sit for another minute or two before I see the person I am supposed to meet finally arrive. Kodama Horaki, she is about a year or older in appearence than her sister Hikari and fairly similar in appearance. Much like Hikari she also wears her hair in two shoulder length pigtails and each of her cheeks is also dotted with a small number of freckles.  
我又坐了一两分钟，直到我该见的人终于出现。葛城光，她看起来比她的妹妹光年纪稍大一些，外貌也颇为相似。和光一样，她也扎着两个齐肩的辫子，脸颊上散布着少许雀斑。

She has a soft, caring expression which I suppose fits someone who works in a facility such as this and she is at the moment wearing a pair of glasses with a thin black rim. She is also wearing the uniform of this facility which is something of a contrast to the short black dress she was wearing on our blind date the other night.  
她有着温柔关切的神情，我想这很适合在这样一个机构工作的人，而且她此刻戴着一副细黑框眼镜。她还穿着这个机构的制服，这与前几晚我们初次见面时她穿的黑色短裙形成了鲜明对比。

I must admit, when I agreed to go on that blind date that had been arranged by Hikari I was quite apprehensive. I disliked the idea of going on a date with someone I had not selected or met previously but I trusted Hikari's judgement. I did not expect that the date be with her sister, nor did I expect to find her sister so attractive and charming.  
我必须承认，当我同意参加光安排的这次相亲时，我相当忐忑。我不喜欢与一个未经自己选择或事先认识的人约会，但我信任光的判断。我没想到约会对象会是她的姐姐，更没想到她姐姐会如此迷人且有魅力。

Kodama notices me and give me a quick smile because making her way over to where I am sitting. I get up from my seat and we both smile and nod at each other politely, "Hey Rei! I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner. We've had a few people come back this week so I've been busy dealing with the paperwork from all that. You haven't been waiting long, have you?"  
小球注意到我，给了我一个快速的微笑，因为她正朝我坐的地方走来。我从座位上站起来，我们俩都礼貌地微笑点头，“嘿，玲！对不起，我没能早点到这里。这周有几个人回来了，所以我一直在忙于处理所有的文件。你没等太久吧？”

I glance up at the clock and contrary to what Kodama has said I can see it is still another couple of minutes to go until we are supposed to meet. I shake my head, "No, I have not been waiting long. You are early as well actually."  
我抬头看了一眼时钟，与小球所说的相反，我看到离我们约定见面的时间还有几分钟。我摇了摇头，“不，我没等太久。实际上，你也早到了。”

Kodama turns to look at the clock herself and shakes her head, "Damn clocks in the office must be wrong then. Can I get you anything? They do a really good hot chocolate here?"  
小球自己也转头看向时钟，摇了摇头，“该死的办公室时钟一定是错了。我能为你点些什么吗？这里的热巧克力真的很不错。”

I nod, "That sounds nice, I would like that then."  
我点头，“听起来不错，那我就期待了。”

"No problem, I'll be back in a moment then."  
“没问题，我一会儿就回来。”

I watch Kodama as she gets up and goes to get our drinks. Whilst she is gone I take the opportunity to look around the facility once again. Her informing me that others have been returning has intrigued me. I wonder how many people in total have come back this year and if this has something to do with Nagisa suddenly returning earlier this year.  
我看着儿玉起身去取我们的饮料。在她离开的间隙，我再次环顾了一下设施。她告诉我其他人也在陆续回来，这引起了我的兴趣。我想知道今年总共有多少人回来了，这是否与渚今年早些时候突然回来有关。

Perhaps it is the case that Nagisa returning was the beginning of a new wave of returnees. Although I fail to see how this could be the case. The way to return is for a person to want to come back and to be able to imagine themselves in one's heart. I fail to see how one person returning could allow others to do that. It is likely this is just coincidence, after all as long as there are people still within instrumentality the possibility remains that they will return.  
或许渚的归来正是新一轮归乡潮的开始。尽管我难以理解这如何可能。归来的途径是个人渴望返回，并在心中能想象自己回归。我不明白一个人的归来如何能让其他人也做到这一点。很可能这只是巧合，毕竟只要还有人留在工具化状态中，他们回归的可能性就依然存在。

The fact that people can still return is one that makes me feel somewhat anxious. I know that there is one person still within that sea who is unlikely to ever want to come back. Yet I fear that one day we will find out that he has returned and I worry that his return would ruin the stability we have enjoyed for so very long. It has not been perfect but it is better than anything he could have offered.  
人们仍能回归的事实让我感到些许不安。我知道海中还有一个人不太可能想要回来。然而我担心有一天我们会发现他已经归来，我担忧他的回归会破坏我们长久以来享受的稳定。这份稳定虽不完美，但总比他能提供的任何东西都要好。

I shake my head, I am not here to contemplate the return nor even the existence of that man. I am here to find out what I can about Nagisa. I admit, I do feel bad about suddenly coming to Kodama and asking for this. I do understand that it might make me look bad in her eyes but I am only trying to ensure Asuka and Shinji are safe and I hope Kodama understands.  
我摇了摇头，我来这里不是为了思考那个男人的回归，甚至不是为了思考他的存在。我是来了解关于渚的事情。我承认，突然来到儿玉这里询问这些，我确实感到有些抱歉。我明白这可能会让她对我产生不好的看法，但我只是想确保明日香和真嗣的安全，希望儿玉能理解。

At the same time, I am also here to see Kodama again, I enjoyed our date together and I would very much like to go on another one, if that is something she desires.  
同时，我也是来看望儿玉的，我很享受我们在一起的约会，如果她愿意，我非常希望能再有一次约会。

Just as I finish that thought she returns with a tray and two cups of hot chocolate. She lowers it onto the table and I take one of the cups from the tray and wrap my arms around it enjoying the warm sensations spreading through my fingers.  
就在我这么想着的时候，她端着一个托盘回来了，上面有两杯热巧克力。她把托盘放在桌上，我从托盘上拿起一杯，用双臂环绕着它，享受着温暖的感觉从手指间蔓延开来。

"How are you then Rei?"  
"那么，丽，你最近怎么样？"

"I am good." I reply, "Are you doing well?"  
"我很好。" 我回答道，"你呢，还好吗？"

She nods and gives me a cute smile, "I'm good! Just been a bit busier recently due to more people returning. It's nowhere near as busy as it used to be a couple of years ago but they also moved a lot of staff on so it's little more than a skeleton crew here so double or triple the work."  
她点点头，给了我一个可爱的微笑，"我挺好的！只是最近因为更多人回来了，所以稍微忙了一些。虽然远不及几年前那么繁忙，但他们也调走了不少员工，现在这里基本上只剩个骨架团队，工作量翻了两三倍。"

"Has this only just started?" I ask.  
"这是刚刚才开始吗？" 我问道。

"Started picking up again in February actually, started out at just one or two a week, around April it was five or six and in the past week we've had at least ten. They've actually been looking at pulling in more staff to cover it, problem is a lot of people who used to work here have moved on to higher paying places and won't want to come back so we're looking at juniors and volunteers for the moment."  
"实际上从二月份开始又多了起来，起初每周只有一两个，到了四月份变成了五六個，而过去这一周我们至少有十个。他们其实已经在考虑增加人手来应对，问题是很多以前在这里工作的人已经去了薪水更高的地方，不愿意回来，所以我们目前只能考虑招初级员工和志愿者。"

"I see." I nod and make a note in my head to speak to Misato about the situation. Perhaps she might be able to find someone to speak to someone who can arrange help for Kodama and the facility, "I hope that you are able to get the help needed here soon."  
"我明白了。" 我点头，暗自记下要和美里谈谈这个情况。也许她能找到人帮忙解决小玉和设施的问题，"我希望你们能尽快得到所需的帮助。"

"Me too!" She sips from her drink, "I suspect... that you're not here to speak to me about my work, are you? Or at least, not what I've been up to in the past week anyway."  
"我也是！" 她啜饮了一口饮料，"我猜……你来这里不是为了谈我的工作，对吧？或者至少，不是我过去一周的动态。"

I shake my head, "No... I am not."  
我摇了摇头，"不……我不是。"

"This is about that one who came back in January isn't it? Kaworu?"  
"这是关于一月份回来的那个人，对吧？薰？"

I can feel the tightening sensation of guilt in my chest as I hear the disappointment in her voice.  
我听到她声音中的失望，胸口感到一阵内疚的紧缩感。

"I apologize I did not mean to misle-"  
"我道歉，我不是有意误导——"

She shakes her head, "No, it's fine, I sort of expected it to be honest. Can I just ask... and be honest, when you agreed to that date did you... did you know?"  
她摇摇头，"不，没关系，老实说，我有点预料到了。我只想问……你能诚实回答吗，当你同意那个约会时，你……你知道吗？"

I shake my head, "No I did not, it was not until I met you and you told me that I learned about you working here. I also... that is not the only reason I am here."  
我摇摇头，“不，我没有，直到遇见你并听你说起，我才知道你在这里工作。而且……我来这里不仅仅是为了这个原因。”

She raises a curious eyebrow, "Oh?"  
她好奇地挑起眉毛，“哦？”

"I also wanted to ask if you would like to see me again. I very much enjoyed our time together on that date and would like to see you again. I apologize for being here to ask about Nagisa but I am very worried about a friend."  
“我还想问你是否愿意再见到我。我非常享受我们那次约会的时光，希望能再次见到你。我很抱歉来这里询问渚的事情，但我真的很担心一个朋友。”

"I see, in which case I understand." She pauses, "Dinner tonight then?"  
"我明白了，那样的话我能理解。" 她停顿了一下，"那今晚一起吃晚饭？"

"Yes, that would be nice."  
"好的，那太好了。"

"Okay then, I'll come and pick you up at around seven." She takes another sip from her cup, "So what do you want to know about Kaworu, keep in mind I can't tell you too much. I know... what he was especially in relation to you guys but some things have to remain private."  
"那就这么定了，我大概七点左右来接你。" 她又从杯子里喝了一口，"那么，你想了解关于渚薰的哪些事情呢？记住，我不能告诉你太多。我知道...他特别与你们的关系，但有些事情必须保持私密。"

"I understand, I would not want you to put your job at risk." I reply, "Was there anything unusual about his return?"  
"我明白，我也不希望你因我而冒险。" 我回答道，"他回来时有什么不寻常的地方吗？"

Kodama shrugs, "Nothing really, pretty standard across the board. He had a bit of emergence sickness but aside from that he seemed healthy enough."  
Kodama 耸了耸肩，"其实没什么特别的，各方面都很正常。他有点出现症，但除此之外看起来还算健康。"

Kodama pauses for a moment, "Well... There is one thing I suppose."  
Kodama 停顿了一下，"嗯... 我想有一件事。"

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, "Oh?"  
我出于好奇挑了挑眉，“哦？”

"Well most people... When they emerge, they come out the same age as when they went in. It happened to me, it's why I only look a year or two older than Hikari despite the age gap technically being a bit bigger. That didn't happen with Kaworu, he actually aged during the process."  
“嗯，大多数人……他们出来时，年龄和进去时一样。我就是这样，所以我看起来只比光年长一两岁，尽管实际年龄差距其实更大一些。但这对渚来说不一样，他在过程中真的变老了。”

"I see, and this has never happened before?"  
“我明白了，这种情况以前从未发生过吗？”

Kodama shakes her head, "Not to my knowledge but... although it was a bit strange he was perfectly healthy regardless."  
木灵摇了摇头，“据我所知没有，但……尽管他有些奇怪，身体却非常健康。”

I take in her words and wonder if there is any importance to them. Kaworu aged whilst in Instrumentality but I wonder if that means anything. It is certainly curious to say the least but I fail to see how it affects anything.  
我琢磨着她的话，思索其中是否蕴含深意。渚薰在人类补完计划中成长了，但我不确定这是否意味着什么。这无疑令人好奇，但我想不出这对现状有何影响。

"I see, and there was nothing unusual around him?" I'm not quite sure what sort of answer I'd expect to this question. Am I expecting A.T. Fields to have just started appearing at random? Objects to be thrown around or people to start having visions?  
“我明白了，他周围没有什么异常吗？”我不太确定这个问题会得到什么样的答案。难道我期待着 A.T.力场突然随机出现？物体四处飞散或人们开始产生幻觉？

Again Kodama shakes her head, "No, nothing at all."  
柯达玛再次摇头，“不，一点也没有。”

"I see." “我明白了。”

"You sound almost disappointed." Kodama smirks as she speaks and I feel my cheeks glow red slightly. I don't quite know what I expected to hear today from her but I was hoping for something, perhaps anything that might prove me right that Kaworu can't be trusted.  
"“你听起来几乎有些失望。”柯达玛说着微微一笑，我感到自己的脸颊微微泛红。我不太清楚今天从她那里期待听到什么，但我希望有什么，或许任何能证明我不信任川吕的事情。”

"What about Kaworu himself?" I ask fearing that I already know the answer.  
"关于薰本人呢？" 我问道，心中害怕已知答案。

"He was a nice person Rei, he was terrified of us all at first which is understandable given who he was but he did as we asked and he kept to himself." Kodama pauses, "You know I… I felt sorry for him. He had clearly been through a lot and he told me a lot of things too."  
"他是个好人，丽。起初他对我们所有人都感到害怕，考虑到他的身份，这是可以理解的，但他按照我们的要求做了，并且保持自我。" 小玉停顿了一下，"你知道吗，我……我为他感到难过。他显然经历了很多，也告诉了我很多事情。"

"Things you are unable to repeat?" I ask.  
"那些你无法复述的事情？" 我问道。

She nods, "Yes things I can't repeat but the more I spoke to him the more I realized that he isn't a bad person, he was a victim too."  
她点头，“是的，有些事我无法重复，但越是与他交谈，我越意识到他并非坏人，他也是受害者。”

"I see." Her words only echo the same things that Asuka has already told me about Nagisa. They are not the words I was hoping to hear or perhaps wanting to hear. They are not the words that confirm to me that Nagisa is a bad guy, they are instead the words that paint him as afraid and nice and a victim.  
“我明白了。”她的这番话不过是重复了明日香已经告诉我的关于渚的事情。这些并非我所期待或渴望听到的，也不是证实渚是坏人的话语。相反，它们描绘出他是一个害怕、善良且同样是受害者的形象。

"I'm sorry I can't tell you what you want to hear Rei." Kodama speaks up, "I know what it's like to be scared for a friend, I've seen my own friends do things and I've been terrified about them, hell my own sister when she started seeing Touji… I wanted to see only bad in him."  
“抱歉，丽，我无法告诉你你想听的。”儿玉开口道，“我知道为朋友担惊受怕的滋味，我见过自己的朋友做出一些事，我曾为他们感到恐惧，甚至我自己的妹妹开始和透司交往时……我只希望看到他的缺点。”

I look up at her and laugh, "It isn't that far fortunately. My friend has met him and is friends with him. I was concerned that he might hurt her. Do you think I am wrong to feel this way?"  
我抬头看着她，笑了起来，“幸好并不远。我的朋友已经见过他，并且和他成了朋友。我担心他可能会伤害她。你觉得我这样想错了吗？”

She shakes he head, "No, not at all. I… think if I was in your position I'd feel the same way. With what he did it's understandable that you would feel that way, I was… apprehensive about Kaworu at first but I had to put that aside for my job and because of that I could get to know him properly."  
她摇了摇头，“不，一点也没错。我……如果我处在你的位置，我也会有同样的感受。考虑到他所做的事，你能这样想是可以理解的。我一开始对渚薰也有些疑虑，但为了工作，我不得不把这些放在一边，正因为如此，我才能真正了解他。”

"I see…" I finish what is left in my cup, "I just do not want my friend to be hurt, nor would I want Shinji to be hurt should Kaworu come back into his life."  
“我明白了……”我喝完杯中剩下的东西，“我只是不想我的朋友受到伤害，也不希望真嗣在渚薰重新进入他的生活时受到伤害。”

"Of course. If you can… perhaps you should try talking to Kaworu yourself. Get him to explain what happened and see if that will help you feel better."  
"当然。如果你能……或许你应该亲自和渚薰谈谈。让他解释发生了什么，看看这是否能让你感觉好些。"

"Perhaps…" "或许……"

I take a moment to think about it, perhaps I do need to speak to Nagisa to understand him more. Did we all not do bad things over that time period? I myself was guilty of a great many things, I myself knew what the Commanders plans were and I could have helped stop it at any time but I did not until the last moment. Myself and Kaworu… we are similar but I hate to admit that fact because I do not like facing the idea that I myself could have been a bad person, it is easier for me to pretend my life started when I emerged and what happened before was under the control of one man.  
我花了一点时间思考，也许我真的需要和渚谈谈，以更好地理解他。在那段时间里，我们不都做了坏事吗？我自己也犯下了许多罪行，我明明知道指挥官的计划，本可以随时阻止，但我没有，直到最后一刻。我和渚……我们很相似，但我讨厌承认这一点，因为我不想面对自己可能是个坏人的想法，对我来说，假装我的生活是从我出现时开始的，而之前的一切都在一个人的控制之下，这样更容易。

If I can be forgiven by Shinji and Misato and Asuka then perhaps I should be capable of forgiving Nagisa. Perhaps I should communicate with him. Perhaps he is not who I think him to be anymore and Kodama and Asuka are right.  
如果真嗣、美里和明日香能原谅我，那么或许我也应该有能力原谅渚。或许我应该与他沟通。或许他已不再是我想象中的那个人，而小玉和明日香是对的。

"Look I have to go back to work now." Kodama pulls me from my thoughts, "Give it a thought though and… still on for dinner tonight?"  
“听着，我现在得回去工作了。”小玉打断了我的思绪，“不过，考虑一下吧，还有……今晚的晚餐还去吗？”

I look up and smile, "Yes, thank you."  
我抬起头，微笑道：“是的，谢谢你。”

**14****th** **September 2021 – Early Evening – Kaworu's Apartment**  
2021 年 9 月 14 日 – 傍晚时分 – 渚薰的公寓

I read through the paragraph one final time to confirm that it sounds correct and conforms to what the publisher wanted. A little bit of extra dialogue between the main character and the AI that controls the ship was all they had requested for that section. It wasn't a bad suggestion, the relationship between the main character and the AI is an important one, especially considering the revelations about the AI later one but I worry that too much dialogue will give things away too easily for readers.  
我再次通读了这段文字，确认它听起来正确且符合出版商的要求。他们只是建议在这一部分增加一些主角和控制飞船的人工智能之间的额外对话。这个建议并不坏，主角和人工智能之间的关系至关重要，尤其是考虑到关于人工智能的后续揭示，但我担心过多的对话会让读者轻易猜到剧情。

Behind me I can hear Kaworu in the kitchen and preparing tonight's meal. I did try to suggest that we order food tonight but he was adamant that he cook something for us instead. I want along with it, still feeling somewhat guilty about nearly ruining the meal last night. From what I can smell I'm expecting a chicken curry tonight. My stomach growls in anticipation of it.  
我身后可以听到渚薰在厨房准备今晚的晚餐。我曾提议今晚点外卖，但他坚持要亲自下厨。我顺从了他的意愿，仍对昨晚差点搞砸晚餐感到有些内疚。从我闻到的味道来看，今晚可能是咖喱鸡。我的肚子已经开始期待地咕咕叫了。

I open up my e-mail client to fire off another e-mail to my publisher with the changes they needed. Hopefully that will be the last thing and I don't need to alter anything else on the book. I also make sure to include a note telling them that I am not available for interviews and also tell them a firm no to the idea of getting someone to stand in as 'Mari Makinami' in interviews and readings.  
我打开电子邮件客户端，准备向出版社发送另一封邮件，告知他们所需的修改。希望这是最后一件事，我不需要在书上做任何其他改动。我还特意附上一条备注，告诉他们我无法接受采访，并且坚决拒绝找人代替'真希波玛丽'出席访谈和朗读会的提议。

I shake my head at the ridiculousness of that request. If anyone is going to speak for me then it'll be me and not someone paid to act as me. What annoyed me more is they even started to explore what Mari Makinami looks like! They sent me some sketch of some brown-haired girl with red rimmed glasses and a massive chest. It's clear what they were going for with that one.  
我对这一荒谬的要求摇了摇头。如果有人要代表我发言，那只能是我自己，而不是某个被雇来扮演我的人。更让我恼火的是，他们甚至开始探究真希波玛丽的形象！他们发给我一张草图，画着一个棕色头发、戴着红色边框眼镜、拥有傲人胸围的女孩。很明显，他们的意图是什么。

They'll be disappointed but they can deal with it. Maybe one day I'll reveal that Mari isn't real and is actually I, the great Asuka Langley Soryu but until that time and only until that time there will be no press, no quotes and Mari remains silent and unseen.  
他们会失望的，但他们得接受现实。也许有一天，我会揭露真希波并不存在，实际上就是我，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，但在此之前，不会有媒体曝光，不会有引述，真希波将保持沉默，不为人所见。

I send off the e-mail and notice that I've received one from Rei some time ago. I must have been so wrapped up on my work I never noticed it come through. I also realize with some guilt that I was supposed to have contacted her earlier today. It has just turned six in the evening here which means for Rei it'll be the early hours of the morning. I could risk it, knowing what Rei is like she could still be awake but it's probably best I don't.  
我发送了电子邮件，注意到不久前收到了丽的一封。我一定是太专注于工作，以至于没注意到它的到来。我还带着一丝愧疚意识到，我本应在今天早些时候联系她的。现在刚过晚上六点，对丽来说，这将是凌晨时分。我知道丽可能会熬夜，但我最好还是别冒险。

I open up the e-mail,  
我打开了电子邮件，

_'Hello Asuka, "“你好，明日香，”_

_I received your message and I am pleased to read that everything is okay, I was concerned after your phone call yesterday.  
我收到了你的消息，很高兴得知一切安好，昨天你打电话后我还挺担心的。_

_As far as Shinji goes I do not think he suspected that it might have been you, it seems that the measures we put in place worked but I must admit I do not feel good about this. I feel bad for deceiving him in such a way but I understand that it is your wish that he does not know.'  
至于真嗣，我认为他并未怀疑那可能是你，看来我们采取的措施奏效了，但我必须承认，对此我并不感到好受。这样欺骗他让我感到内疚，但我知道这是你的意愿，不想让他知道。_

I feel a tightening in my chest at reading that last paragraph. I feel guilty as well about it, I don't want to put Rei in that position and I know it's hurting him. It should only just be for a little while longer though. I'll... I'll contact him Rei.  
读到最后一段，我感到胸口一阵紧缩。对此我也感到愧疚，我不想让绫波陷入这种境地，我知道这会伤害他。不过，应该只需要再坚持一小段时间。我会……我会联系他的，绫波。

_'For contacting me, unfortunately I am not going to be in this evening so it would probably be better if you contacted me tomorrow. I will message you with a safe time to do so. I am glad to hear that you are well.  
“联系我时，很遗憾今晚我不在家，所以可能还是明天再联系我比较好。我会给你发个安全的时间。很高兴听到你一切安好。”_

_Also, I feel I should apologize for my actions when you told me about your friendship with Nagisa. Whilst I am still apprehensive about him and will likely remain so until I am certain he can cause no harm to you or my brother I appreciate that you might have a different perspective having spoken to him directly and spent time with him.  
“另外，我觉得应该为上次你提到与渚的友谊时我的反应道歉。虽然我对他仍心存疑虑，可能要等到我确信他不会对你或我弟弟造成伤害时才会消除，但我理解你与他直接交谈并相处后可能有不同的看法。”_

_If I have angered you in any way when speaking about him then I apologize for that as well.  
“如果我在谈论他时有什么冒犯之处，我也为此道歉。”_

_I will speak to you tomorrow.  
我明天会和你说话。_

_Rei_

(")-(")o

I ready myself to write a reply to her when Kaworu suddenly announces from the kitchen that dinner is ready.  
我正准备给她回信，这时 Kaworu 突然从厨房宣布晚餐准备好了。

"No problem, let me just…" I look up whilst speaking and see his big dumb smiling face beaming at me and then I gaze over towards the table where I see he has already set out two plates. I let out a laugh and shake my head, "Never mind, it can wait."  
“没问题，让我先……”我边说边抬头，看到他那张傻笑的大脸正对着我，然后我望向餐桌，发现他已经摆好了两副餐具。我忍不住笑出声，摇了摇头，“算了，不急。”

The laptop screen gets folded down and the device itself placed onto his coffee table before I get up and make my way over the table. I sit myself down and Kaworu takes a seat opposite me. I look down at my plate and just as I guessed it is indeed a simple chicken curry. My mouth starts to water at the sight of it and I look up to see Kaworu is looking at me expectantly. He catches me eye and quickly looks down at his own plate.  
笔记本屏幕被合上，设备放在他的咖啡桌上，我起身走向餐桌。我坐下后，Kaworu 坐在我对面。我低头看着盘子，果然如我所料，是一份简单的鸡肉咖喱。看到它，我的口水都快流出来了，抬头一看，Kaworu 正期待地看着我。他注意到我的目光，迅速低头看向自己的盘子。

I smile to myself as I mix up some of the rice with the sauce and scoop it onto my fork along with a good sized piece of chicken. Just as with the meal last this this too is incredibly tasty and I start to feel like I could get used to the idea of Kaworu cooking for me.  
我暗自微笑，将一些米饭与酱汁混合，用叉子舀起一大块鸡肉。正如上次那顿饭一样，这顿也极其美味，我开始觉得能习惯由渚为我做饭的想法。

I'm barely haflway through my first mouthful before I hear Kaworu speak, "Is it to your liking?"  
我刚吃到一半，就听到渚开口问道：“合你口味吗？”

I shoot him a glare as I try to finish my mouthful of food, I swallow and nod, "It is delicious."  
我瞪了他一眼，试图咽下嘴里的食物，然后点头说：“非常美味。”

Kaworu breathes a sigh of relief and then starts to eat from his plate too. I simple shake my head and let out a laugh as I see an embarrassed smile creep onto his lips.  
Kaworu 松了一口气，然后也开始吃他盘子里的东西。我简单地摇摇头，看着他嘴角露出尴尬的笑容，不禁放声大笑。

"I apologize if my questioning is annoying." He speaks, "I am simply not used to doing something like this, I have only cooked for myself so I don't know if it is good for others. Your approval in particular means a lot to me."  
"如果我的提问让您感到厌烦，我向您道歉。" 他说："我只是不习惯做这样的事情，我只为自己做过饭，所以我不知道这样做对别人好不好。你的认可对我来说尤其重要。"  

"It's fine, I guess I can deal with it for the moment." I remark with another laugh and continue to eat the meal. Every now and then I'll rip off a bit of the naan bread and use it to dip into my curry and scoop up bits of rice. As I do this I look up to see Kaworu is looking at me and staring at his own bread. I grin at him, "You know how bread works right?"  
"没关系，我想我暂时还能接受"。我又笑着说了一句，继续吃着饭。时不时我会撕下一点馕饼，用来蘸咖喱和舀米饭。当我这样做的时候，我抬起头，看到卡沃鲁正看着我，盯着他自己的面包。我冲他咧嘴一笑："你知道面包是怎么做的吧？"

He nods, "I know how it works for sandwiches but I was unsure how it worked in context of this meal. I… forgot to research that part."  
他点点头，“我知道三明治怎么吃，但不确定这种餐点该怎么处理。我……忘了研究这部分。”

I continue to laugh, "Well it's not like there are any rules to it you idiot! Just rip it off and dip it in your food or whatever."  
我继续笑着说，“又没有什么规则，你这傻瓜！直接撕下来蘸着吃就行了。”

"Oh I see…" He tentatively rips apart a piece of the bread, "I was also uncertain about the heat of the meal as well. Is this too your liking? It is not too hot?"  
“哦，我明白了……”他小心翼翼地撕下一块面包，“我还对这餐的温度不太确定。你觉得合适吗？不会太热吧？”

"Kaworu..." I speak sternly, "It's good. I've got a pretty high tolerance when it comes to hot food anyway. Besides it should be you who is more concerned with that with it being your first curry, how is it for you?""  
"カヲル..." 我严肃地说，"很好。我对辣食的耐受度本来就挺高的。再说，既然这是你第一次吃咖喱，你应该更关心自己的感受，你觉得怎么样？""

Kaworu nods, "It is good although I will admit the sensation of heat is something I am unused to but I am sure I will adapt to it over time."  
カヲル点头道，"确实不错，不过我得承认这种热辣的感觉我还不太习惯，但我相信随着时间的推移我会适应的。"

"Well you picked a good curry to start with, some of them would probably kill you." I joke but see him look at me with a horrified expression.  
"嗯，你选了个不错的咖喱开始尝试，有些咖喱可能会要了你的命。" 我开玩笑地说，却看到他一脸惊恐地看着我。"

"Really? A curry can do that."  
"真的吗？咖喱能做到那个？"

"No not really!" I shake my head, "It'd probably be really unpleasant though."  
"不，不是真的！" 我摇摇头，"不过那肯定会非常不舒服。"

"Oh… Good, I think… I will avoid that sort of thing all the same."  
"哦……好吧，我想……我还是尽量避免那种事情吧。"

"A wise decision." I smile and we resume eating our meals in a comfortable silence. I reach over to get a drink, another bottle of wine from Kaworu's fridge that he has gotten out. This is another white wine, a Spanish wine this time, whatever that means. It tastes good though.  
“明智的决定。” 我微笑着，我们继续在舒适的沉默中用餐。我伸手去拿饮料，另一瓶从 Kaworu 冰箱里拿出的葡萄酒。这次是西班牙白葡萄酒，虽然我不太懂这意味着什么，但味道确实不错。

I have to admit Kaworu has done well with the two meals he has cooked so far, I'm quite surprised how someone who has only been properly human for less than a year and never had to cook before is able to do this. I guess he's had little choice but to do it though.  
我不得不承认 Kaworu 在烹饪这两顿饭方面做得很好，我很惊讶一个正式成为人类不到一年、之前从未需要做饭的人能做到这样。我想他别无选择，只能这么做。

As we continue to eat a strange thought suddenly enters my head. It's something I haven't actually realized until now but Kaworu is eating meat. In fact this is not the first time, he has had it on a number of occasions since I've met him. Yet I thought with him technically being the same as Rei he too would be unable to eat meat like her.  
我们继续吃饭时，一个奇怪的想法突然闯入我的脑海。我直到现在才意识到，Kaworu 在吃肉。事实上，这不是第一次，自从我认识他以来，他已经多次吃过肉。然而，我以为从技术上讲，他和 Rei 是一样的，他也会像她一样不能吃肉。

"Kaworu… Can I ask something?"  
"渚薰…我能问个问题吗？"

"Of course." He replies after sipping from his wine glass.  
""当然可以。"" 他啜饮了一口红酒后回答道。

"This might seem strange but… Why is it that you are able to eat meat?" I ask.  
""这可能听起来有点奇怪，但是…为什么你能吃肉呢？"" 我问道。

"I do not understand." He looks at me curiously.  
"我不明白。" 他好奇地看着我。

"It's just… You and Rei are similar right?" I wait for him to nod, "She can't eat meat but you can, why is that?"  
"只是……你和丽很相似对吧？" 我等待他点头，"她不能吃肉但你却可以，这是为什么？"

"Oh, that would be…" Kaworu looks up and shakes his head sadly, "I believe that is due to the way in which we were created."  
"哦，那应该是……" 薰抬头，悲伤地摇了摇头，"我想那是因为我们被创造的方式不同。"

"Explain." "解释一下。"

"You are right that myself and Rei are similar, we were both created from a human doner and supplanted with the soul of one of the seeds of life. In my case it was Adam and her case Lilith. I do not believe that Rei Ayanami's creation was as smooth as mine was, she was created from the scavenged DNA of Yui Ikari whilst my donor was in a stronger and more complete position."  
"你说的没错，我和丽确实相似，我们都是由人类捐赠者的身体创造出来的，并植入了生命之种的灵魂。我的情况是亚当，而她的是莉莉丝。我不认为绫波丽的创造过程像我一样顺利，她是用碇唯的 DNA 碎片拼凑而成的，而我的捐赠者则处于更强大、更完整的状态。"

"Who was your donor?" I ask him.  
""你的捐赠者是谁？"" 我问他。

"I do not know, it is not information that I was ever granted access to nor did I seek it out. I do not know if that person lives nor do I know if they were even aware that they were a donor. Knowing SEELE I would doubt both things, they disliked loose ends."  
"我不知道，这不是我曾被授权访问的信息，我也没有去寻找。我不知道那个人是否还活着，也不知道他们是否知道自己曾是捐赠者。考虑到 SEELE，我怀疑这两点，他们不喜欢未解决的问题。"

Kaworu pauses for a moment to sip from his wine again, "With my creation there was an entire team of people working around the clock to ensure my body was kept fit and healthy. I was attended to at all times by the best doctors and scientists in the world. I do not believe Rei would have been… as fortunate as I was."  
渚薰停顿了一下，再次啜饮他的葡萄酒，"我的创造过程中，有一整个团队昼夜不停地工作，确保我的身体保持健康。我随时都有世界上最好的医生和科学家照料。我不认为绫波会像我一样幸运。"

I bow my head slightly as I recall the various stories I heard about Rei's so-called upbringing. I never saw any of it for myself but I have heard of the place where she lived. I heard Rei and the others speak about how it was in some abandoned part of Tokyo-3, how it had walls that were damp and rotting away and it was unpopulated aside from the unfortunate homeless of Tokyo-3 and a myriad of rats.  
我微微低头，回忆起听过的关于绫波所谓的成长的各种故事。我从未亲眼见过，但我听说过她居住的地方。我听绫波和其他人谈论过，那是在第三新东京市的一个废弃区域，墙壁潮湿腐烂，除了不幸的第三新东京市的无家可归者和无数的鼠群，那里空无一人。

I once called her the Commander's favourite. I looked at her with envy believing that she lived a life of luxury and praise. That because she had the Commander's attention she had everything that I thought I wanted. How wrong was I? How awful must I have sounded when I said those things to her?  
我曾称她为指挥官的宠儿。我带着嫉妒的目光看她，以为她过着奢华和赞誉的生活。因为得到了指挥官的关注，她拥有了我认为我想要的一切。我错得有多离谱？当我对她说过那些话时，我听起来一定很糟糕吧？

"No… She really wasn't…" I finally mutter.  
“不……她真的不是……”我终于低声说道。

"All of these additional resources meant that… my human vessel was stronger than that of Ayanami's. SEELE thought I necessary to minimize weakness as best they could for me to carry out their goals."  
“所有这些额外的资源意味着……我的人类躯体比绫波的更强。SEELE 认为我必须尽可能减少弱点，以便我能执行他们的目标。”

"I see…" I prod a piece of chicken with my fork before stabbing it angrily and shoving it into my mouth.  
"我明白了…" 我用叉子戳了戳一块鸡肉，然后愤怒地刺穿它，猛地塞进嘴里。

"SEELE made an effort to suppress my humanity. They wanted their vessel strong but wanted to keep my humanity at bay except for where it would benefit them. They would remind me constantly of what I was and what I had been put on this earth to do. They wanted me to be unable to resist the call on that day."  
"SEELE 努力压制我的人性。他们希望他们的容器强大，但又想将我的人性控制在对他们有利的地方。他们不断提醒我我是谁，以及我被赋予这个世界的使命。他们希望我无法抗拒那一天的召唤。"

"You meant the day you betra-" I catch myself before I finish the word but I can see still the spark of sadness in his eyes, "I'm sorry… I didn't mean to."  
"你是说你被背叛的那天——" 我及时打住，但仍能看到他眼中闪过的悲伤，"对不起…我不是故意的。"

Kaworu simply shakes his head, "No… That is what it was, it was a betrayal. I betrayed my only friend because I was unable to resist my own urges. I was unable to spot the lies in front of me and gave into the desire to reunite with the being known as Adam."  
渚薰只是摇了摇头，“不……那就是它，那是一种背叛。我背叛了我唯一的朋友，因为我无法抗拒自己的欲望。我没能识破眼前的谎言，沉溺于与被称为亚当的存在重聚的渴望中。”

He tears off a piece of bread and dips it into his curry, "As… 'Tabris'… I always felt something calling to me. I was told what it was, that call was an answer to the pain of loneliness that I always felt. Each passing day that pain grew larger and the call grew more alluring."  
他撕下一块面包，蘸进咖喱里，“作为……‘塔布里斯’……我总感觉有什么在召唤我。我被告知那是什么，那呼唤是对我始终感受到的孤独之痛的回应。随着时间的推移，那份痛苦愈发强烈，呼唤也变得更加诱人。”

There is another brief pause as he scoops up a bit of rice with his bread, "SEELE explained it all of course. They told me of the being known as Adam and how it was waiting under Tokyo-3 for me. Not only that but they gave it a purpose, not only would it cure the pain I felt but it'd cure the world. All would be reborn and perfect!"  
他再次短暂停顿，用面包舀起一些米饭，“当然，SEELE 解释了一切。他们告诉我那个被称为亚当的存在，以及它如何在第三新东京市下等待着我。不仅如此，他们还赋予了它一个目的，不仅会治愈我感受到的痛苦，还会治愈整个世界。一切都将重生，变得完美！”

I see his expression darken as he continues, "I believed every lie they told me, so when I got to Tokyo-3 I knew what I had to do. When I was there I felt the call grow even stronger, it spoke to me, it wanted me and it only confirmed what I had been told until… I finally got to it and I saw it wasn't Adam at all. It was Lilith and in that moment… I knew the truth."  
我看到他的表情阴沉下来，继续说道：“我相信了他们告诉我的每一个谎言，所以当我到达第三新东京市时，我知道我必须做什么。在那里，我感到那种召唤变得更加强烈，它对我说话，它想要我，这只会证实我被告知的一切，直到……我终于接近了它，却发现那根本不是亚当。那是莉莉丝，在那一刻……我明白了真相。”

I rise from my seat and make my way over to him and hold him, running my hand through his soft hair, "It's okay Kaworu… I know the rest."  
我从座位上站起来，走向他并拥抱他，用手抚摸他柔软的头发，“没事的，渚薰……我知道剩下的故事。”

"There are times when I don't know if I should blame SEELE for it or if I should blame myself. I had the power within me to resist it. I could conjure an A.T. Field of such strength, my S2 Organ gave me unlimited power, I could have… I could have resisted SEELE but… I was weak to the call and their lies."  
有时候，我不知道我是否应该责怪 Seele，还是应该责怪自己。我体内有力量去抵抗它。我可以召唤出如此强大的 A.T.力场，我的 S2 机关赋予我无限的力量，我本可以……我本可以抵抗 Seele，但是……我对那种召唤和他们的谎言太软弱了。

"Stop it!" I say sharply as I continue to hold him, "There was nothing you could have done and… things worked out in the end."  
"住手！" 我严厉地说道，继续抱着他，"你无能为力，而且……最终事情还是解决了。"

"Perhaps!" He nods, "I suppose… there is little point in me thinking about that now."  
"或许吧！" 他点头，"我想……现在再想这些也没什么意义了。"

"No… No you won't." I pat him on the back and move back to my seat, as I sit back down I see Kaworu smiling at me again.  
"不……不，你不会的。" 我拍了拍他的背，回到自己的座位上，坐下时我看到渚薰再次对我微笑。"

"Thank you Asuka… for listening to me." He pauses.  
"谢谢你，明日香……愿意听我说。" 他顿了顿。

I shrug, "Don't worry about it."  
我耸耸肩，"别放在心上。"

"I… I don't know if it is appropriate but there is something I wanted to ask."  
"我……我不知道这样是否合适，但我有件事想问。"

"Go ahead." I reply to him with a mouthful of chicken and rice.  
"说吧。" 我嘴里塞满了鸡肉和米饭，回答他。

"How come you decided to come back to Germany?"  
"你怎么决定回德国的？"

"Ah."

I didn't expect him to ask me that, at least not yet. I shake my head, "It was… just something I felt I had to do to be honest. It wasn't like there was a big argument or incident I just… I couldn't be there anymore with them and I had to come back."  
我没想到他会这么快问我这个问题。我摇摇头，"老实说，我只是觉得我必须这么做。并不是因为发生了什么大争吵或事件，我只是……再也无法和他们待在一起了，我必须回来。

I pause and try to recall the day that I left.  
我停顿了一下，试图回忆起离开的那一天。

**6****th** **June 2016 - Asuka Langley Soryu**  
2016 年 6 月 6 日 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷

My eyes open immediately at the sound of my alarm going off and I quickly bring my hand down to silence the device. I lie still for a few moments staring at the time, it's early, far too early for my liking and for a brief moment I contemplate rolling back over and going back to sleep. I realize however that it is simply not possible for me to do that, I'm awake this early for a reason, so instead all I can do is let out and annoyed sigh and sit up.  
闹钟一响，我的眼睛立刻睁开，迅速伸手按下设备使其静音。我静静地躺了几分钟，盯着时间，太早了，远早于我所喜欢的时刻，有那么一瞬间我考虑翻身继续睡。然而，我意识到这根本不可能，我这么早醒来是有原因的，所以我只能发出一声恼怒的叹息，然后坐起身来。

That annoyance at the situation soon fades when I reach over to turn on my lamp and see the card and wrapped up box waiting on my bedside table. Instead I feel something else, sadness? Regret? Fear? I'm not entirely sure, it's a mixture of feelings but I suppose that's to be expected.  
当我伸手去开灯，看到床头柜上那张卡片和包装好的盒子时，对情况的恼怒很快消散了。取而代之的是另一种感觉，悲伤？后悔？恐惧？我不完全确定，这是一种混合的情绪，但我想这是可以预料的。

I reach over and pick up the card and turn it over in my hand to reveal Shinji's name written, in beautiful handwriting, on the card. I shake my head as certain thoughts enter my mind.  
我伸手拿起卡片，翻转过来，看到卡片上用漂亮的笔迹写着真嗣的名字。我摇了摇头，某些念头涌入脑海。

_'You don't have to do this... You can stop it, just tell him that you changed your mind. He already said you can change your mind at any time, it wouldn't exactly be difficult.'  
'你不必这么做……你可以停下来，只要告诉他你改变了主意。他早就说过你随时可以改变主意，这并不难。'_

I put the card back down on the table and shake my head. I can't stop this, not now, it's something that I have to go through with. I can't stay in this place any longer, I just... I can't be here anymore. I just don't belong here, I don't deserve to be here with these people.  
我把卡片放回桌上，摇了摇头。我无法阻止这一切，至少现在不能，这是我必须经历的。我不能再待在这个地方了，我只是……我不能再待在这里了。我不属于这里，我不配和这些人在一起。

I know they probably feel the same, that I don't belong here with them. I can't blame them really, not after the way I've acted towards them all. Sure, it's not like I've acted like that since we all returned but that doesn't matter. They still remember and so do I and I know it's just a matter of time before that monster surfaces again.  
我知道他们可能也有同样的感觉，觉得我不属于他们。我不能怪他们，毕竟我对他们的态度如此恶劣。当然，自从我们回来后，我并没有那样表现，但这并不重要。他们仍然记得，我也记得，我知道那怪物迟早会再次浮现。

Of course, they're too polite to ask me to leave so I'm going to make it easy for them. I contacted Fuyutsuki weeks ago and arranged this. I've packed what few belongings I have and I'll leave before any of them wake up. There are just a few things I need to do first.  
当然，他们太有礼貌了，不会要求我离开，所以我要为他们省去麻烦。几周前我就联系了冬月，安排了这一切。我已经打包好我仅有的几件物品，会在他们醒来之前离开。只是还有几件事需要先处理。

I step out of the bed and look at the clock again. I need to be quick and quiet during this. Everythign has been planned out, I need to shower first then I'll get dressed before giving Shinji his gift. When that is done I'll leave and they won't need to see me again, I'll tell Fuyutsuki to let Misato know what I've done but not where I've done. It'll be better this way, if they find out they'll just try to get me to stay and... I'll probably do it.  
我下了床，再次看向时钟。我需要在这段时间里迅速而安静。一切都已计划妥当，我得先洗个澡，然后穿好衣服，再给真嗣送上礼物。完成后，我就会离开，他们也不必再见到我。我会告诉冬月让美里知道我所做的事情，但不会告诉她地点。这样会更好，如果他们发现，只会试图让我留下，而我……很可能会答应。

I slide the door to my room open as quietly as I can and slip out into the main hallway. It's only a short distance to the bathroom from here but I do need to make my way through the living room, that brings me to my first obstacle. As I enter the living room I can hear a soft snoring sound and I immediately freeze and look towards the source of the sound.  
我尽可能轻地滑开房门，悄悄溜进主走廊。从这里到浴室只有一小段距离，但我确实需要穿过客厅，这成了我的第一个障碍。当我走进客厅时，听到一阵轻微的鼾声，我立刻停下脚步，朝声音的来源望去。

I try to stifle a laugh as I see Rei lying on the sofa, or at least the hair of Rei Ayanami. Somehow, and I'm not sure how, she has managed to roll herself up in her blankets to create a perfect blanket burrito, or as I might call it a 'bureito.'  
我试图忍住笑，因为我看到丽躺在沙发上，或者至少是绫波零的头发。不知怎么的，我不确定她是怎么做到的，她竟然把自己裹在毯子里，形成了一个完美的毯子卷，或者我可能会称之为‘布雷托’。

_'No more sofa for you after today Rei, you can have that room now.'  
'从今天起，丽，你不能再睡沙发了，那个房间归你了。'_

A few brief moments later I'm in the bathroom, have disrobed and turned the shower on. As the water comes down around me my thoughts turn once more to why I'm doing this today. When were those seeds sewn of me wanting to leave? I can't really pin down an exact moment, I guess it was just a feeling I had ever since we call came back from Third Impact.  
片刻之后，我站在浴室里，脱去衣物，打开了淋浴。随着水流环绕着我，思绪再次转向今天我为何要这么做。那些让我渴望离开的种子是何时种下的？我无法确切指出一个时刻，大概是从我们所有人从第三次冲击归来后，那种感觉就一直萦绕在我心头。

Thing started off well enough. Shinji was the first person to return on that day and I was not far behind. I can still remember those initial moments on the beach when I returned. I can remember the rush of emotions, the pain and the confusion of it all. I can remember what Shinji did, or tried to do to me in his confusion and how I was able to stop him.  
事情起初还算顺利。那天，真嗣是第一个回来的，而我紧随其后。我至今仍记得刚回到海滩时的那些瞬间。我记得那些情感的涌动，痛苦与混乱交织。我记得真嗣在混乱中对我所做或试图做的事，以及我是如何阻止他的。

I can remember how he sat there and cried when he realized what it was he was doing and how afterwards we lay in silence just holding one another. We even spoke to one another after it, we actually had a proper and decent conversation. I told him things about my life, about my mother and my upbringing and he told me about his. It was nice, it was cathartic and it felt right.  
我记得他当时坐在那里，意识到自己在做什么时哭了，之后我们静静地躺着，只是互相拥抱着。甚至在事后，我们还彼此交谈，进行了一次真正体面的对话。我向他讲述了我的生活，我的母亲和我的成长经历，他也向我倾诉了他的故事。那感觉很好，是一种宣泄，也感觉对了。

Of course, that feeling couldn't last. Barely a day later Misato returned and soon afterwards Rei turned up before more and more people came back. There was no more talking after that, there was no more holding one another and there was barely any communication. Shinji had Misato and Rei to confide in now, he had his family back and I... Well I've never had a family, Misato tried to make me feel welcome but I'd already burned those bridges, hadn't I? So, it never felt right.  
当然，那种感觉无法持久。不到一天，美里回来了，不久后丽也出现了，越来越多的人陆续返回。从那以后，我们再也没有交谈，再也没有互相拥抱，几乎没有任何交流。真嗣现在有美里和丽可以倾诉，他找回了家人，而我...我从未有过家人，美里试图让我感到欢迎，但我已经烧毁了那些桥梁，不是吗？所以，那种感觉从未对过。

Soon afterwards we fell into routines. Shinji became more withdrawn as more people came back, he won't venture out of the apartment and is terrified of anyone knowing who he is. I spend most of my time outside the apartment going on long walks and avoiding people.  
不久之后，我们陷入了日常。随着越来越多的人回来，真嗣变得更加孤僻，他不敢走出公寓，害怕任何人知道他的身份。我大部分时间都在公寓外长时间散步，避开人群。

Rei... Rei actually went back to school as soon as she could. It's strange but she has grown so much from the girl she used to be. She is still quiet but you can see a spark of humanity in her that wasn't there before. She speaks about what she wants to do in the future, of places she wants to go and things she'd like to see.  
丽...丽其实一能动就回学校了。虽然奇怪，但她已经从过去的那个女孩成长了许多。她依然沉默寡言，但你能看到她眼中闪烁着以前没有的人性光芒。她谈及自己未来的打算，想去的地方和想见的事物。

As far as my future goes... I've thought about it but what sort of future does someone like me have? Shinji... Rei... Misato, they all have a chance, they're all heroes and can do whatever they want but me? I'm little more than nothing. I'm the girl who lost, I'm the girl who failed, the girl who had the potential but squandered it all. I'm the monster who did nothing but hurt others.  
至于我的未来...我曾思考过，但像我这样的人会有什么样的未来呢？真嗣...丽...美里，他们都有机会，都是英雄，可以做任何想做的事，而我呢？我几乎什么都不是。我是那个失败者，是那个失败了的女孩，拥有潜力却挥霍一空。我是那个只会伤害他人的怪物。

I'm the one who screamed and yelled because she couldn't get her own way. I'm the one who turned everyone away who tried to help. What does the future hold for someone like me? All I'm capable of is hurting other people. Everyone here knows it too. They think I don't notice it but I can see and feel their eyes on me when I walk around this town. I know how Misato and Rei look at me, I know they're terrified that I'll hurt Shinji and I don't blame them. I've done it once so why not again?  
我就是那个因为得不到自己想要的东西而尖叫怒吼的人。我就是那个把所有试图帮助我的人都拒之门外的人。像我这样的人，未来会怎样呢？我所能做的只是伤害别人。这里的每个人都知道这一点。他们以为我没注意到，但我能感觉到他们在镇上走动时投在我身上的目光。我知道美里和绫波怎么看我，我知道他们害怕我会伤害真嗣，我不怪他们。我曾这样做过一次，那为什么不会再做一次呢？

_'Because you aren't that person anymore, you don't shout or yell anymore. You don't need to be like that...'  
“因为你不再是那个人了，你不再大喊大叫了。你不需要那样……”_

It's a nice thought that passes through my mind but what if it isn't true? Besides, even if I'm not that person anymore it doesn't erase the person I was and the person they think I am. I'd rather save the others the hassle of having to tip toe around be because they're frightened. I just hope they all go forward to have a happy life, they deserve it.  
这个想法很美好，但它可能是真的吗？再者，即使我不再是那个人，也无法抹去我曾经的模样和他们心目中的我。我宁愿让其他人免于因害怕而不得不小心翼翼地对待我。我只希望他们都能向前迈进，拥有幸福的生活，他们值得拥有。

I turn the shower off and wrap a towel around myself. I slip out of the bathroom and once more past the bureito lying on the sofa. Within moments I'm back in my room and drying off. I hastily throw my clothes on and grab the gift and card. This is the last thing I need to do, probably the most difficult task.  
我关掉淋浴，用毛巾裹住自己。悄悄走出浴室，再次经过躺在沙发上的武士。片刻后，我回到房间开始擦干身体。匆忙穿上衣服，拿起礼物和卡片。这是最后一件需要做的事，可能也是最困难的任务。

I take those few careful steps to Shinji's door and slide it open as quietly as I can. I take a feep breath to steady my nerves before stepping into his room. It's dark, save for a thin slither of light coming in through a crack in his curtains. The light is providing just enough illumination for me to see him lying on his bed. He's facing away from me, good, that'll make this easier.  
我小心翼翼地走到真嗣的门前，尽可能轻地拉开它。深吸一口气稳定情绪，然后踏入他的房间。除了窗帘缝隙透进的一丝光线外，房间里很暗。这微弱的光线足以让我看到他躺在床上。他背对着我，很好，这样会容易些。

I silently approach the side of the bed and place the gift and card down on his bedside table before kneeling next to the bed.  
我悄无声息地走到床边，将礼物和卡片放在他的床头柜上，然后跪在床边。

"Shinji..." I whisper to him, "I'm... I'm leaving. I don't know how long I'm going for, it might be a short amount of time or it might be forever but please... promise me you won't look for me okay."  
“真嗣……” 我轻声对他说，“我……我要离开了。我不知道会去多久，可能是短暂的时光，也可能是一辈子，但请你……答应我，不要来找我，好吗？”

I let out a sigh, "I... I just... I don't deserve to be here with you guys. You're all good people but me... I'm not, I was horrible to you all, I was a monster and... I know we should be leaving that in the past but I can't. I think about who I was every day and I just can't forget that. I just... I wanted to see you one last time and maybe do something nice for you."  
我叹了口气，“我……我只是……我不配和你们在一起。你们都是好人，而我……我不是，我对你们都很糟糕，我是个怪物，而且……我知道我们应该把那些留在过去，但我做不到。我每天都在想过去的自己，我无法忘记。我只是……想再见你一面，也许为你做点好事。”

I pause as I feel the stinging of tears in my eyes, I bring up a hand to wipe the tear away and continue to speak to him, my whispering voice trembling as I do so, "Today is your birthday isn't it? I got you a card and a gift, I hope you like it. I got you a new music player, I know you lost your old one and I know you loved it so... I wanted to get you something nice. I also... put some money in the card too, so get yourself something nice with it. Some new shirts to replace the white ones you always have or a nice cake."  
我停顿了一下，感觉到眼眶中的泪水刺痛，抬起手擦去泪水，继续颤抖着低声对他说，“今天是你的生日，对吧？我给你准备了一张卡片和一份礼物，希望你会喜欢。我给你买了一个新的音乐播放器，我知道你弄丢了旧的那个，而且我知道你很喜欢它……所以我想给你买些好东西。我还……在卡片里放了一些钱，这样你可以用它买些好东西。比如换掉你常穿的白衬衫，或者买个美味的蛋糕。”

I pause again and smile, "I'm sorry for everything I did Shinji. I never meant to hurt you or anyone else like I did. I just hope you know that I never meant it when I said I hated you, I always liked... no... I always loved you Shinji, I still do and... maybe I always will but I just can't be here anymore so... goodbye Shinji and... Happy Birthday."  
我再次停顿，微笑着说：“我对所做的一切向你道歉，真嗣。我从没想过要伤害你或任何人。我只是希望你知道，当我说的那些讨厌你的话时，我从未真心那么想，我一直喜欢……不……我一直爱着你，真嗣，现在依然如此……也许我会一直爱下去，但我不能再留在这里了……所以，再见，真嗣，还有……生日快乐。”

With those final words I quickly turn around and leave his room. I rush back into my room blinking furiously and bringing my hands up to my eyes to wipe away any tears that threaten to run down my cheeks. I quickly grab my case and head back out into the hallway towards the front door. I slip my feet into my shoes and open the front door as quietly as I can.  
说完这些最后的告别，我迅速转身离开他的房间。我冲回自己的房间，用力眨眼，抬起手来擦去眼角即将滑落的泪水。我迅速抓起行李箱，走出房间，沿着走廊向大门走去。我悄悄地穿上鞋子，尽可能轻地打开前门。

As I step out a cool breeze hits my cheeks and I turn to see the solemn figure of Kozo Fuyutsuki.  
当我踏出门外，一阵凉风吹拂过我的脸颊，我转身看到了神情肃穆的 Kozo Fuyutsuki。

"Fuyutsuki." I nod towards him.  
"冬月。" 我向他点头示意。

"So, you're actually leaving? You don't want to change your mind?" He asks me.  
"所以，你真的要走？不想改变主意吗？" 他问我。

"Yes." I confirm without hesitation, "Let's get this over and done with."  
"是的。" 我毫不犹豫地确认，"让我们尽快解决这件事。"

### Chapter 9: Get At The Truth  
第九章：揭露真相  

**15th September 2021 – Early Morning – Kaworu's Apartment  
2021 年 9 月 15 日 – 清晨 – 渚薰的公寓**

There are several thoughts running through my head as I pick up my phone and try to work out the time in Japan right now. Right at the forefront is what I'm going to say to Rei when I speak to her. I still haven't quite made up my mind about what it is I'm going to do regarding the e-mail, I want to tell her but then if I do that means I have to send the damn thing and I'm still not sure if I should do that.  
我拿起手机，试图计算日本现在的时间，脑海中闪过许多念头。最迫切的是，我该对绫波说些什么。关于那封电子邮件，我还没完全决定该怎么做，我想告诉她，但如果说了，就意味着我必须发送那该死的东西，而我仍然不确定是否应该这么做。

There is also the ongoing situation with Kaworu to consider. I know I don't have to tell Rei about what happened the other night but I feel like I have to. I feel like I have this duty to tell Rei the truth about it. I feel like I'll be worse off in some way if I keep that from her.  
还有与渚薰的持续状况需要考虑。我知道不必告诉绫波那天晚上发生了什么，但我总觉得有责任告诉她真相。我感到如果隐瞒这件事，我会在某种程度上变得更糟。

At the same time, I don't even know what me and Kaworu are at the moment. Are we just good friends or something more? Are we boyfriend and girlfriend now? It's not as if we've sat down since we kissed and spoke about it. Yet, I know that we are something because of the way we speak to each other, because of the way we look at each other and the way that I feel about him. I feel comfortable around him, I feel like I can talk to him and tell him anything.  
同时，我甚至不确定我和渚薰目前的关系。我们是好朋友还是更进一步？我们现在是男女朋友吗？自从我们接吻后，我们并没有坐下来谈过这件事。然而，我知道我们之间有某种联系，因为我们的交谈方式，因为我们对视的方式，以及我对他的感觉。在他身边我感到舒适，我觉得可以和他交谈，告诉他任何事情。

The proof of that was last night when I told him the circumstances of my leaving Japan to come back to Germany. It's a story I hadn't told before, it was a day I hadn't thought about for a very long time. I hadn't even told Rei about what had happened on that day and she is my best friend. So clearly that means me and Kaworu have something.  
昨晚我向他讲述了离开日本回到德国的情况，这证明了一切。这是一个我以前从未讲过的故事，那一天我已经很久没有想过了。我甚至没有告诉绫波那天发生了什么，而她是我最好的朋友。所以显然这意味着我和渚薰之间有某种联系。

I am still apprehensive about what that thing might be though. I don't know if I'm ready for that sort of thing or if I can be the person Kaworu needs. I still feel like the only thing I'm good for is hurting him and other people, I still remember clearly that person I was before Third Impact and I worry that she is still there. I still worry that people will remember that person too and realize that I'm not worth the effort. I don't want to be alone, I don't want people to abandon me but at the same time I know what I was and if they did I only have myself to blame.  
我仍然对那东西可能是什么感到忧虑。我不知道自己是否准备好面对那种事情，或者我能否成为 Kaworu 需要的人。我仍然觉得我能做的唯一一件事就是伤害他和别人，我依然清晰地记得第三次冲击前的自己，我担心她还在那里。我仍然担心人们会记得那个人，并意识到我不值得他们付出努力。我不想孤单，我不想被人们抛弃，但同时我也知道我曾经的模样，如果他们真的离开，我只能怪自己。

I wonder if this thing between Kaworu and myself is a good thing. Kaworu deserves someone nice and kind for him, he deserves someone who can provide warmth and comfort and support. Someone like...  
我不知道 Kaworu 和我之间的事情是否是件好事。Kaworu 值得拥有一个善良温柔的人，他值得一个能给予他温暖、安慰和支持的人。就像……

I shake my head before my mind travels down that path. Of all the people I can think of who would be perfect for Kaworu it would have to be Shinji wouldn't it? Shinji does fit that bill though, sure he was a bit of an idiot and oblivious but he was kind, he was nice to be around and before things went downhill he could provide support. As Eva pilots we brought out the best in each other, I just didn't want to admit that back then.  
我摇了摇头，阻止思绪沿着那条路走下去。在我能想到的所有适合加持的人中，非真嗣莫属，不是吗？真嗣确实符合这个条件，虽然他有点傻，又迟钝，但他善良，和他在一起很愉快，而且在事情恶化之前，他还能提供支持。作为 EVA 驾驶员，我们激发了彼此最好的一面，只是当时我不愿承认这一点。

Of course, Kaworu would have been perfect for him too. Kaworu is good looking, kind and able to listen. The two of them would actually have been a good couple were it not for the whole betrayal and one having to kill the others. I'm not sure that is a bridge that can be mended now and naturally there is Rei to consider, I dread to think what she would do if Kaworu approached Shinji.  
当然，加持对他来说也是完美的。加持英俊、善良且善于倾听。如果不是因为背叛和必须杀死对方的话，他们俩其实会是一对好伴侣。我不确定现在是否还能修复那座桥梁，而且还有绫波要考虑，我不敢想象如果加持接近真嗣，她会做出什么。

I stop mid thought and shake my head, what the hell am I thinking? Why am I thinking all of this, why am I pairing this guy up with someone else when it's me who likes him and who kissed him. What the hell happened to me? Why can't I just allow myself to pursue happiness for myself? I want to be with Kaworu! I don't to actually try this and prove I'm not that person anymore, that's why I didn't run.  
我思绪中断了，摇了摇头，我到底在想什么？为什么我会想这些，为什么我要把这家伙和别人配对，明明是我喜欢他，是我吻了他。我到底怎么了？为什么我不能允许自己去追求自己的幸福？我想和渚在一起！我不想真的去尝试证明我已经不是那个人了，这就是为什么我没有逃跑。

That's why I am still here right now, that's why I kissed him and why I spent last night cuddled up with him. That's why I told him the story of how I left Japan. I like this guy and... maybe, just maybe I actually deserve to be happy too.  
这就是为什么我现在还留在这里，这就是为什么我吻了他，为什么昨晚我和他依偎在一起。这就是为什么我告诉他我离开日本的故事。我喜欢这家伙，而且……也许，只是也许，我也真的值得幸福。

I look down at my phone again feeling I can't put this off any longer. I scroll to Rei's name and fire off a quick message telling her to call me. I don't want to risk phoning her first and having Shinji answer, this time I'm doing it as we arranged. A minute later my phone starts to ring and I quickly answer it, "Rei?"  
我又低头看向手机，感觉不能再拖延了。我滚动到绫波的名字，迅速发了一条消息让她给我打电话。我不想先打电话给她，让真嗣接听，这次我按我们约定的做。一分钟后，我的手机开始响了，我迅速接听，“绫波？”

There is a brief moment of silence and I worry that maybe it is Shinji but much to my relief I hear her voice come through, _"Hello Asuka, it's good to hear your voice."_  
有一瞬间的沉默，我担心可能是真嗣，但令我松了一口气的是，我听到了她的声音传来，“你好，明日香，听到你的声音真好。”

I smile to myself, "It's good to hear yours too Rei, I was worried for a moment that it might have been Shinji?"  
我暗自微笑，“听到你的声音我也很高兴，丽，刚才我还担心可能是真嗣呢？”

_"Shinji is not here at the moment, he is out with Touji and Kensuke."  
“真嗣现在不在这里，他和东治还有健介出去了。”_

"Oh, that's good! He still doesn't suspect anything does he?"  
"哦，那很好！他还没怀疑什么吧？"

_"No he does not, at least he has not said anything."  
"没有，至少他还没说什么。"_

"Good..." I nod my head, "I wouldn't want him to... find out about me like that. I want him to find out properly. That's... why I'm calling you actually, there's something I wanted to ask you."  
"那就好……" 我点点头，"我不想让他那样发现我的事。我希望他能正式地了解。其实……我打电话给你是有件事想问你。"

_"Are you ready to tell Shinji you are alright?"_ Rei's question comes quickly and I can hear the excitement in her voice.  
"你准备好告诉真嗣你没事了吗？" 绫波的问题迅速传来，我能听出她声音中的兴奋。

I let out a sigh, "I... I don't know Rei, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've got a few... issues that need working out."  
我叹了口气，"我...我不知道，绫波，这就是我想和你谈的。我有些...问题需要解决。"

_"Yes, I am aware."_ I can hear the sarcasm in her voice.  
"是的，我知道。" 我能听出她声音中的讽刺。

"You know Rei, there is a time and place for sarcasm."  
"你知道吗，丽，讽刺也是要看时间和场合的。"

_"I apologize." "我道歉。"_

"It's fine, I'll allow it... but only because you're my best friend." I laugh.  
""没关系，我原谅你... 但只因为你是我最好的朋友。"" 我笑着说。

_"What is it you wished to talk to me about?"  
"你希望和我谈些什么呢？"_

"It's about... Well over the last few weeks a few things have happened and it's made me do a lot of thinking. I mean you came to visit me in Germany and then we found out about Kaworu it just... made me think about the past and why I left Japan... I keep on thinking about what I've asked you to do, to hide the truth about me and I'm wondering if I should... contact them."  
"是关于...过去几周发生了一些事情，让我思考了很多。我是说，你来德国看我，然后我们发现了关于薰的事情，这让我回想起过去，为什么我离开了日本...我一直想着我让你隐瞒的真相，我在想我是否应该...联系他们。"

_"If there is anything I can do to help I will do so!"_ Rei cuts me off, again sounding very excited by what I'm saying, _"I can arrange travel and somewhere for you to stay."_  
"如果我能做些什么来帮忙，我一定会的！"" 绫波打断了我，再次显得对我的话非常兴奋，""我可以安排旅行和住处。"

"Wait! Rei... Wait..." I stop her, "I don't know if I'm ready for... anything in person but I... I wrote an e-mail to Shinji. I was going to send it and it was going to explain everything, like why I left and what I've been doing but it was also going to... I was going to mention you. I wanted you to look at it first and... Make sure it was alright I guess."  
"等等！丽...等等..." 我叫住她，"我不知道自己是否准备好面对面谈任何事，但我...我给真嗣写了一封电子邮件。我本打算发送它，解释一切，比如我为什么离开以及我一直在做什么，但同时也会...我会提到你。我希望你先看看，确保没问题。"

_"I see."_ Rei pauses for a moment, _"That should be acceptable, when will you send it?"_  
"我明白了。" 丽停顿了一下，"这应该可以，你打算什么时候发送？"

I freeze for a brief moment as I realize the implications of what I've just said. I feel that rush of nerves in side my stomach, there is no going back now.  
我愣了一瞬间，意识到刚才那番话的含义。我感到胃里一阵紧张的冲动，现在已无退路。

"I... I'll send it this afternoon."  
"我... 我下午就发出去。"

_"That's great! Do you want me to show him as well?"  
"太好了！要不要我也给他看看？"_

"No!" I quickly reply, "No, absolutely not... not yet. I just want you to look at it. I've... explained about you finding me and why I left and a few other things. Just take a look and tell me if you want anything changing, I don't want... to cause any problems for you."  
"不！" 我迅速回复，"不，绝对不行... 还不能。我只是想让你先看看。我已经... 解释了你找到我以及我离开的原因和其他一些事情。你先看看，告诉我有没有需要修改的地方，我不想... 给你带来任何麻烦。"

_"I understand."_ Rei pauses, _"I am happy for you to tell the truth about our situation though. I am sure that he will understand and there will be no issue."_  
"我明白。" 丽停顿了一下，"我很高兴你能如实说明我们的情况。我相信他会理解的，不会有任何问题。"

"I hope not." I hesitate for a moment before moving onto the next section, "Thank you Rei."  
"希望如此。" 我犹豫片刻，然后继续下一部分，"谢谢你，丽。"

_"It is not a problem, I am so glad that this is finally happening."  
"这没什么，我很高兴这一切终于要发生了。"_

I let out a laugh, "Well... don't get too far ahead of yourself yet. I still need to send it to him and then... well we'll see what happened. Just don't think I'll be flying out there next week okay."  
我忍不住笑出声，“好吧...别太得意忘形了。我还需要把它寄给他，然后...嗯，看看会发生什么。别以为我下周就会飞过去，好吗？”

_"Don't worry I will be patient but when you have sent it we should look at flying you over here to see him and MIsato and the others. I'm certain they'll all be so happy to hear from you!"  
“别担心，我会耐心等待，但当你寄出后，我们应该考虑让你飞过来见他、Misato 和其他人。我确信他们都会很高兴听到你的消息！”_

"Yeah..." I want to believe what she is saying but my mind just doesn't let me believe it. After the way I left and all the ways I hurt Shinji before that I can't believe he'd ever be happy to hear from me again. I'm also fairly certain that flying out there like Rei wants is probably out of the question too. Even if Shinji is happy to see me I still have to deal with the likes of MIsato and the others and I know that they'll probably have a less than favorable opinion of me.  
"“是啊...”我想相信她的话，但我的内心就是无法让我相信。在我那样离开以及之前对 Shinji 造成的所有伤害之后，我无法相信他还会愿意再听到我的消息。我也相当确定，像 Rei 希望的那样飞过去大概是不可能的。即使 Shinji 愿意见我，我仍然要面对 Misato 和其他人，我知道他们可能对我没什么好印象。”

Suddenly as I look at the phone in my hand I start to wonder what it is I'm doing. Should I really be contemplating sending this e-mail? Is this really worth it? What exactly am I trying to achieve? It's too late now though, I'd already said I'm going to do it and... I'm sick of running away. I don't want to run away anymore.  
突然间，当我看着手中的手机时，我开始疑惑自己在做什么。我真的应该考虑发送这封电子邮件吗？这真的值得吗？我到底想达成什么？但现在为时已晚，我已经说过要做了，而且...我厌倦了逃避。我不想再逃避了。

_"I know you have difficulty believing that Asuka."_ Rei suddenly speaks, _"But they do. Misato speaks about you often, she told us how she regrets the way she treated you and that she should have done more for you."_  
"我知道你很难相信这一点，明日香。" 绫波突然开口说道，"但他们确实如此。美里经常提到你，她告诉我们她后悔曾经那样对待你，她应该为你做得更多。"

I shake my head, "She's just saying that..."  
我摇了摇头，"她只是那么说说而已..."

_"No she isn't."_ Rei stops me, _"She was really upset the day you left, she blamed herself for it all and was ready to do everything she could to get you back. The only reason she didn't is because Fuyutsuki told her about your demands. Even then she still tried to find you for at least a month afterwards."_  
"不，她没有。" 丽阻止了我，"你离开的那天她非常难过，她把一切都归咎于自己，并准备尽一切努力让你回来。她没有这么做的原因是冬月告诉了她你的要求。即便如此，她仍然试图在之后至少一个月内找到你。"

I sit down on the bed, Rei had never told me that before. I always thought that Misato just accepted that I had gone. I wonder what I would have done if she had tracked me down, would I have gone back willingly? Would I have told her to go away? If she had tracked me down and found me it would have been confirmation that they did care but would I have believed it back then?  
我坐在床上，丽从未告诉过我这些。我一直以为美里只是接受了我的离开。我在想，如果她找到了我，我会怎么做？我会自愿回去吗？我会让她离开吗？如果她找到了我，那将证明他们确实在乎我，但当时我会相信吗？

"Rei..." “丽……”

_"The others as well, HIkari misses her friend, she was looking forward to going back to school with you in her class. Even Touji and Kensuke missed you."  
"其他人也一样，光子想念她的朋友，她期待着和你一起回到学校，在你的班级里。就连东治和真希也想念你。"_

"Well I didn't miss those idiots!" I laugh, "Look Rei just... don't expect me to be back over there immediately. It's not that easy, even if I wanted to I have commitments here with the book and with... Kaworu too..."  
"好吧，我可没想念那些傻瓜！" 我笑着说，"看吧，丽，别指望我马上就回去。没那么简单，即使我想回去，我在这里还有书的事务，还有...和渚薰的约定..."

_"What about over Christmas then? It would be wonderful to see you over that time and Shinji has a performance with his new group that I am sure he'd love for you to attend."_ There is a brief pause, _"I suppose... if he proves himself then Nagisa would be able to come as well."_  
"那圣诞节怎么样？那段时间见到你一定很棒，而且真嗣和他的新乐队有场演出，我相信他会很希望你去的。" 短暂的停顿后，"我想...如果他表现得好，渚也可以一起来。"

"Yeah..." I trial off and think about it. It does sound nice, my book releases at the start of December and then spending time with them in Japan? Would I be able to do it? I'm not sure, I still don't know if I can send this damn e-mail yet and besides I still don't know how people will react. Rei is telling me these things about how I was missed and how people care but I don't know how true that is.  
"是啊..." 我犹豫了一下，思考着。听起来确实不错，我的书十二月初发行，然后在日本和他们一起度过时光？我能做到吗？我不确定，我甚至还没决定是否要发这封该死的邮件，而且我仍然不知道人们的反应会如何。丽告诉我这些关于我被想念和人们关心的事，但我不知道这些话有多真实。

Besides... there is Kaworu to consider as well. Me and Kaworu... we are something now and we probably will be by then. I might be welcome, but would he? How would they react if we turn up as a couple?  
此外...还有渚薰需要考虑。我和渚薰...我们现在有了某种关系，到那时可能依然如此。我可能会受到欢迎，但他呢？如果我们以一对情侣的身份出现，他们会怎么反应？

"Actually Rei... I need to tell you about Kaworu..."  
“其实，绫波...我需要告诉你关于渚薰的事...”

_"What is it? Has he hurt you?"  
“什么事？他伤害你了吗？”_

"No! Nothing like that, it's just..." I sigh, "He invited me to his place for dinner other night for dinner and... it was really nice Rei and I... I kissed him. I... I think I like him..."  
"不！不是那样的，只是……" 我叹了口气，"他前几天晚上邀请我去他家吃饭，然后……真的很不错，丽，我……我吻了他。我……我觉得我喜欢他……"

_"You kissed Nagisa?" "你吻了渚？"_

I feel my stomach drop as the tone in her voice gets darker. All of a sudden, I get the feeling that I've just done something very wrong.  
我感到胃部一阵下沉，她的语气变得阴沉。突然间，我有一种感觉，我刚刚做了一件非常错误的事情。

_"Yes... I did." “是的……我做了。”_

There is a long pause from the other end of the line, "Rei, are you okay?"  
电话那头沉默了许久，“丽，你还好吗？”

_"I am afraid I have to go. Goodbye Asuka."_ I can hear the venom in her voice as she speaks to me. It's frightening in a way. I've never heard her sound angry like that before.  
"“恐怕我得挂了。再见，明日香。”我能听出她语气中的恶意，她对我说话时那种声音令人害怕。我从未听过她如此生气。”

"Wait Rei don-" "等等，丽，别——"

I try to stop her from going but I barely get halfway through my sentence before the line goes dead. I stare at the device for a few moments and feel my hand tighten around it. I stand up and try to suppress the urge to throw my phone at the wall in anger. Not anger at Rei but at myself, I should have known better than to tell her that.  
我试图阻止她离开，但话还没说完，电话就断了。我盯着设备愣了几秒，感到手中的力度在收紧。我站起来，努力压制住把手机砸向墙壁的冲动。不是对丽生气，而是对自己，我早该知道不该告诉她的。

A moment later my phone vibrates again. It's a message and I know it'll be from Rei. I don't know what it'll say but after hearing her hang up like that I almost dread to think about it. I should have waited to tell her about myself and Kaworu, I should have waited until she had the chance to believe he wasn't the person she thought he was.  
片刻后，我的手机再次震动。是一条信息，我知道是丽发来的。我不知道内容会是什么，但听到她那样挂断电话后，我几乎害怕去想。我本该等到合适的时机再告诉她我和薰的事，我本该等到她有机会相信他不是她所认为的那个人。

Slowly I turn my phone around to look at the message. Just as I expected it is from Rei, _'I do not wish to continue this conversation or speak with you today. Goodbye.'_  
我缓缓将手机转过来查看消息。正如我所料，是丽发来的，'我不想继续这场对话，今天也不想再和你说话。再见。'

What the hell is that supposed to even mean? My hand hovers over her contact details ready to call her again and try to work this out but I feel like she won't answer. Maybe I can send her a message but with her like this would she even read it? Instead all I can do is grip my phone tightly in my hand and suppress the urge to scream out.  
这到底是什么意思？我的手悬在她的联系信息上，准备再次打电话给她，试图解决这个问题，但我感觉她不会接。也许我可以给她发条消息，但她现在这样，会看吗？相反，我只能紧紧握住手机，抑制住尖叫的冲动。

I can feel my arm starting to drop and get myself ready to hurl the phone at the wall but a soft tapping at the bedroom door stops me. I don't turn around as the door opens and Kaworu enters the room quietly.  
我感觉到手臂开始下垂，准备将手机砸向墙壁，但卧室门上传来的轻轻敲击声阻止了我。我没有转身，门开了，薰静静地走进房间。

"Asuka… is everything alright?"  
"明日香…一切都还好吗？"

"Fine…" I reply through gritted teeth.  
"没事…" 我咬牙切齿地回答。

"What happened?" He asks me as he enters the room.  
"发生了什么？" 他走进房间问我。

"I… told Rei about us kissing and I seem to have pissed her off." I keep my back to him and shrug as I speak.  
"我…告诉了丽我们接吻的事，结果好像把她惹火了。" 我背对着他说话，耸了耸肩。

"I… It is understandable given her feelings about me." Kaworu replies solemnly, "I am sorry I have caused trouble for you."  
"我…考虑到她对我的感情，这是可以理解的。" 渚薰严肃地回答，"我很抱歉给你带来了麻烦。"

"Idiot! Don't you dare! This isn't you, this is… that stubborn… argh!" I spin around and come face to face with Kaworu, "This isn't your fault Kaworu. You haven't caused any trouble, Rei is just being… an idiot."  
"笨蛋！你敢！这不是你，这是…那个固执的…啊！" 我转过身来，面对面地看着渚薰，"这不是你的错，渚薰。你没有造成任何麻烦，丽只是…在犯傻。"

"I do not think she is." Kaworu speaks softly, "Rei's fears and feelings towards me are understandable given what I have done in the past. I am… not surprised that such a thing would anger her."  
"我不认为她是那样。" 渚薰轻声说道，"丽对我的恐惧和感情是可以理解的，鉴于我过去的所作所为。我……并不惊讶她会因此生气。"

"Well it's annoying!" I bark back, "It's annoying and she's a goddamn idiot!"  
"真是烦人！" 我回吼道，"烦人至极，她简直就是个该死的白痴！"

Kaworu steps closer to me and brings his hand up slowly to my cheek. I lean into the warmth of his palm and sigh, "I… The last thing I wanted to do was piss her off, she's been one of my only friends Kaworu, the only one who understands."  
渚薰向我靠近，缓缓抬起手抚上我的脸颊。我依偎在他掌心的温暖中，叹息道，"我……我最不想做的就是惹她生气，她一直是我为数不多的朋友之一，渚薰，唯一能理解我的那个人。"

He nods, "I know and I wish there was something I could do to help, perhaps I could contact her myself?"  
他点头，“我知道，我也希望能做些什么来帮忙，或许我可以亲自联系她？”

I laugh, "I doubt you'll accomplish much with that but… whatever, give it a go."  
我笑道，“我怀疑你用这方法能有多大成效，不过……随你吧，试试看。”

He smiles, "I will Asuka… I would not like to see your friendship with Rei broken in such a way. I… dislike seeing you hurt."  
他微笑，“我会试试的，明日香……我不愿看到你和丽之间的友谊就这样破裂。我……不喜欢看到你受伤。”

"Thank you." I continue to stand there letting Kaworu run his hand through my hair and down along my cheek. I reach up with one hand and softly cup his cheek, my hand runs along his warm and pale skin. I allow my hand to reach up a bit further and my fingers meet his soft grey hair.  
"谢谢。" 我继续站在那里，任由渚薰的手穿过我的头发，沿着我的脸颊滑下。我伸出一只手，轻轻地托住他的脸颊，手指在他的温暖而苍白的肌肤上滑动。我让手再往上一些，指尖触碰到他柔软的灰色发丝。

We stand like this for a moment until Kaworu leans in closer to me. I'm surprised by his boldness and ready myself as he places a hand on my hip and draws me in close. My lips meet his as we kiss for a third time this weekend. I feel Kaworu's hand on my hip slowly start to slide upwards and I wonder for a moment what his destination for it is, I wonder if he would be daring enough for that. He doesn't seem to be as it moves up and then around to my back.  
我们就这样站了一会儿，直到渚薰向我靠近。他的大胆让我有些惊讶，我准备好迎接他，他将手放在我的腰间，将我拉近。这个周末我们第三次接吻，我的唇与他的相触。我感觉到渚薰的手在我的腰间慢慢向上滑动，我一时好奇他的目的地会是哪里，想知道他是否大胆到那个程度。但他并没有，手向上滑后绕到了我的背后。

I continue to return the kiss and part my lips ever so slightly to allow my tongue to slide through and meet his. I feel a moment of hesitation from him, understandable considering our previous kisses didn't go that far but he soon gets the idea. At the same time I allow my other hand to explore what I can of his body, I run it up his side and to his back before moving back down to grip his firm backside.  
我继续回应这个吻，微微张开嘴唇，让我的舌头滑入与他相触。他有一瞬间的犹豫，考虑到我们之前的吻没有这么深入，这是可以理解的，但他很快明白了。与此同时，我让另一只手探索他的身体，我沿着他的侧边向上，到他的背部，然后再向下抓住他结实的臀部。

I almost laugh when I hear the soft gasp leave his lips through our kissing. If this is how he reacts to me touching his backside I wonder how he'd react to… actually no, I'm not going to think about that yet. My body might feel ready but my mind isn't and I can't help but feel it's the same for him. For now this is nice, this kissing and light touching is nice.  
当听到他在亲吻中轻声抽气时，我几乎要笑出声来。如果他对我触碰他的臀部有如此反应，我好奇他对……实际上，不，我现在还不想考虑那个。我的身体可能感觉准备好了，但我的思维还没有，我不禁觉得他也是如此。眼下这样很好，这种亲吻和轻柔的触碰很美好。

We continue this for moments before I break the kiss and look up at him, "Shall we… make ourselves more comfortable?"  
我们继续这样片刻，然后我中断亲吻，抬头看向他，“我们……要不要让自己更舒服些？”

**16th September 2021 – Mid-afternoon – Misato's apartment  
2021 年 9 月 16 日 – 下午 – 美里小姐的公寓**

"I'm home!" I announce happily to no one in particular as the apartment door swings open. I peer into the hallway and start to try to bring everything I'm carrying into tight space. In one hand is my cello, tucked under that arm are a few papers from the session, held carefully in my other hand is a box and I have a backpack on. I shuffle carefully into the small hallway and almost manage to trip over a pair of Misato's shoes that were left there, fortunately I'm able to catch myself before anything gets damaged.  
“我回来了！” 我高兴地宣布，虽然并没有特别对谁说，随着公寓门的打开。我探头望向走廊，开始尝试将我携带的所有东西挤进狭小的空间。一只手拿着大提琴，夹在腋下的是几张会议文件，另一只手小心翼翼地捧着一个盒子，背上还背着书包。我小心翼翼地挪进狭窄的走廊，差点被留在那里的美里的一双鞋绊倒，幸运的是，我及时稳住了自己，没有让任何东西受损。

Now in the hallway I set the cello and other items down and start to remove my shoes. As I begin to do so I'm surprised to hear Rei's soft voice call back to me, "Welcome home!"  
现在站在走廊里，我把大提琴和其他物品放下，开始脱鞋。正当我开始这么做时，我惊讶地听到丽温柔的声音回应我，“欢迎回家！”

I smile to myself as I finish removing my shoes and I snatch up the box from the ground leaving the cello and session papers behind for the moment. As I make my way out of the hallway and into the living room I hide the box behind my back. I look around the room and see Rei is sat on the couch absent mindedly browsing something on her laptop.  
我一边脱鞋一边暗自微笑，然后迅速从地上捡起盒子，暂时留下大提琴和会议文件。当我走出走廊进入客厅时，我把盒子藏在背后。我环顾房间，看到丽坐在沙发上，心不在焉地在笔记本电脑上浏览着什么。

I have to admit I'm a little bit surprised but happy to see Rei is back already. Mondays are usually when she volunteers at the school and she generally comes back later in the day. I actually wonder if everything is alright with her, it does seem unlike Rei to have skipped out on something like that and for most of yesterday and this morning she's seemed distracted and... sad I guess? I don't know why, I know she went out on a date with someone the other night but she said everything went well. Unless something has happened since.  
我得承认，看到丽已经回来了，我有点惊讶但也很高兴。通常周一她会在学校做志愿者，一般会晚些回来。我其实有点担心她是否一切安好，她似乎不太可能就这样错过志愿活动，而且昨天大部分时间和今天早上她都显得心不在焉，甚至有些...悲伤？我不知道为什么，我知道她前两天和某人约会了，她说一切都进行得很顺利。除非之后发生了什么事。

As I enter the room and take a look at her I can see she still looked a little bit sad now. It would probably be hard for others to tell but I can. Her expression is one I recognize all too well, it's one I've worn myself on many occasions. Rei... It's weird to think I never saw it years ago but she does look a lot like me and shares a lot of similar mannerisms.  
当我走进房间，看到她时，我发现她现在看起来还是有点悲伤。对其他人来说可能很难察觉，但我能看出来。她的表情我再熟悉不过了，我自己也曾多次流露过这样的表情。丽...真奇怪，我以前竟然没注意到，但她确实在很多方面都和我相似，包括一些习惯动作。

The thing is I know I can't just ask her directly what's wrong. I know that she won't tell me because that's another thing we share, she'll just evade it and pretend everything is okay. Eventually it'll build up inside her and I know from experience that it can only make things worse when that happens. It happened to me a long time ago and it felt awful.  
问题是，我知道不能直接问她怎么了。我知道她不会告诉我，因为我们还有一个共同点，她会回避问题，假装一切都好。最终，这些情绪会在她内心积累，我从经验中知道，这只会让事情变得更糟。很久以前，我也经历过这种感觉，非常糟糕。

The problem with this is that when I'm down and people can tell they'll stick with me and ask me what's wrong, they'll coax it out of me and I can't do that with Rei or other people. I'm just not very good at it, I don't know how to do that and I'm always afraid of upsetting them or annoying them. It's the same for everyone, I just ask them what's wrong and if they don't tell me I shy away. I've been like that with Rei, I've been like that with Misato and I was the same with Asuka when she was here.  
这个问题在于，当我情绪低落，别人能看出来时，他们会陪着我，问我怎么了，他们会慢慢引导我说出来，但我对丽或其他人是做不到这一点的。我不擅长这样，我不知道该怎么做，总是害怕让他们不高兴或烦到他们。对每个人都是这样，我只是问他们怎么了，如果他们不说，我就退缩了。我对丽是这样，对美里也是这样，对明日香在这里时也是一样。

All three of those people though they're good at doing that. Rei can be stubborn, she won't leave my side or she'll just hug me and not let go until I finally relent. Misato doesn't quite go that far but she gives me an opportunity to talk freely and without judgement.  
尽管如此，这三个人都很擅长做这件事。丽很固执，她不会离开我身边，或者她会紧紧拥抱我，直到我最终屈服。美里虽然没有那么极端，但她给了我一个自由倾诉且不受评判的机会。

Asuka… I smile as I think of her, she wasn't quite as nice with her method but she had a way of coaxing things out of me. She always had a way of getting me to see the bright side or just feeling better about a situation, she always kinda pushed me. I just wish I could have done the same for her and helped her out.  
明日香……想到她，我不禁微笑，她的方法虽不总是那么温柔，却有种让我吐露心声的本领。她总有办法让我看到光明的一面，或是让心情好转，她总是推着我前进。我只希望自己也能为她做同样的事，帮助她走出困境。

Whilst I might not be able to find out what is wrong by talking to her perhaps I can try to find out or at least cheer her up in other ways. What I have held behind my box is part of that. On the way home I bought her a cake from a bakery that I know she likes. It's a double chocolate sponge cake with a healthy amount of chocolate cream between the layers and a round profiterole sitting on the top.  
虽然我可能无法通过交谈了解她的烦恼，但或许我可以尝试用其他方式找出问题，至少让她开心起来。我藏在盒子里的东西就是其中一部分。回家的路上，我给她买了她喜欢的面包店的蛋糕。那是一款双层巧克力海绵蛋糕，夹层间涂满了浓郁的巧克力奶油，顶上还放着一个圆滚滚的泡芙。

"Are you okay Rei?" I ask her as I enter the room fully.  
“丽，你还好吗？”我走进房间，关切地问她。

I see her nod, "I am fine, thank you.  
我看到她点头，“我很好，谢谢。”

I open my mouth briefly to maybe ask the follow up question, to ask her if she is sure or to point out that she is looking a bit sad but I simply can't do it. Instead I just weakly move the conversation along as if I can't tell that something is wrong.  
我短暂地张开嘴，想要问后续的问题，问她是否确定，或者指出她看起来有点悲伤，但我就是做不到。相反，我只是无力地继续对话，仿佛看不出有什么不对劲。

"How were things at the school today? I noticed you're home early."  
“今天学校怎么样？我注意到你回家早了。”

She looks across at me, "Yes, they were taking the students on a trip this afternoon so I only had to attend the morning classes. It went well. How was your session today, was it more comfortable than the last one?"  
她朝我这边看过来，“是的，他们今天下午要带学生们去旅行，所以我只需要上早上的课。一切都很顺利。你今天的会议怎么样，比上次舒服些吗？”

"Yeah! It… It was really good actually." I smile, "We got split off into pairs, I was paired up with a violinist and we seemed to get along quite well."  
“是啊！实际上……真的很好。”我微笑着说，“我们被分成了几组，我和一位小提琴手搭档，我们似乎相处得相当不错。”

"Did you play anything?" “你们演奏了什么吗？”

I nod enthusiastically, "Yeah! We didn't really have time to prepare anything so we decided it'd be best to just improvise. We decided on a key to play in and I just played some basic chords over a metronome, she would jump in and accompany me with a solo on her violin! It was incredible, I think people were actually impressed with us!"  
我热情地点头，“耶！我们确实没时间准备什么，所以决定即兴发挥最好。我们选了一个调来演奏，我就跟着节拍器弹了一些基本和弦，她则用小提琴即兴独奏加入！太不可思议了，我觉得人们真的被我们打动了！”

Rei is smiling at this point so I continue, "The others were really good as well. Some of them already had an idea of what they wanted to play. We heard people play some things by Bach, some Mozart and one pair even tried to play some film themes. You should have heard them Rei!"  
丽这时笑了，我继续说，“其他人也很棒。他们中有些人已经有了想演奏的曲目。我们听到了巴赫、莫扎特的作品，甚至有一对尝试演奏了一些电影主题曲。丽，你真该听听他们的演奏！”

Rei smiles, "That is good to hear!"  
丽微笑着说，“那真是太好了！”

"Yeah! After we each played for the group the conductor gathered us around and told us a bit more about what the performance he wanted to put on. He had this idea to do a history of music from the 18th Century onwards, composers like Bach and Beethoven but also move through to modern day."  
“耶！我们每个人为团队演奏后，指挥把我们召集起来，告诉我们他想要呈现的表演的一些细节。他有个想法，要做一场从 18 世纪开始的音乐史演出，包括巴赫和贝多芬这样的作曲家，同时也要涵盖到现代音乐。”

I remember what he shown us and smile, "He gave us a potential playlist, I'm not exactly familiar with a lot of it. The classical stuff I know and like because it was what I grew up listening to but I don't know the modern stuff. He played a brief bit of some of it and it sounds quite complicated, I didn't realize the arrangements for some of the songs could be so complex, the time signatures used and the compositions are…"  
我记得他给我们展示的内容，微笑着说：“他给了我们一个潜在的播放列表，我对其中很多并不熟悉。古典音乐我了解并且喜欢，因为那是我从小听到大的，但现代音乐我不太懂。他播放了一些片段，听起来相当复杂，我没想到有些歌曲的编排会如此复杂，使用的时间签名和作曲结构……”

I look over to see Rei almost grinning at me as I carry on speaking. I feel my face turning red realizing that I'm just talking and not really letting her speak, "Sorry, I'm… Anyway, It sounds quite complicated… I just hope I can do it."  
我转头看到丽正几乎对我咧嘴笑，我继续说着。我感到脸颊发烫，意识到我一直在说，没让她说话，“抱歉，我……总之，听起来相当复杂……我只希望我能做到。”

My words seem to draw a faint smile from Rei, "Do not apologize, it is wonderful to hear you speak to passionately and I have absolutely no doubt that you will be excellent. You are extremely talented."  
我的话语似乎让丽微微一笑，“不必道歉，听到你如此热情地表达真是美妙，我绝对相信你会非常出色。你极具天赋。”

I can feel my cheeks glowing red, "I… I just practice a lot. I'm… not that good really, I still make a lot of mistakes and there are some things I can't play."  
我能感觉到我的脸颊泛红，“我…我只是练习得很多。我…其实没那么好，我还是犯了很多错误，有些曲子我弹不了。”

"And that is why you continue to practice so that you will be able to play such things and make fewer mistakes. I have heard you and you are very good, you should give yourself more credit."  
“正因如此你才继续练习，以便你能弹奏那些曲子并减少错误。我听过你的演奏，你非常棒，你应该给自己更多信心。”

I swallow down the words I'm about to speak to further downplay my abilities. It's a habit I need to get out of, that I'm trying hard to get out of. Rei is right, I do practice a lot and the reason I practice so much is so that I can play more advanced pieces one day.  
我咽下即将出口的话，进一步淡化自己的能力。这是我需要改掉的坏习惯，我正努力摆脱它。丽是正确的，我的确练习得很勤奋，我如此努力练习的原因是希望有一天能演奏更高级的曲目。

I mean in many ways I already do play some complicated material. I also have a good grasp of the theory behind it. I'm able to read music, I can play in a variety of more complex time signatures with ease and I can handle transcribing music fairly well. So instead of downplaying it all I look at say and speak words I'm unfamiliar with when it comes to a compliment, "Thank you."  
我的意思是，在很多方面我已经能演奏一些复杂的曲目了。我对背后的理论也有很好的掌握。我能读懂乐谱，轻松驾驭多种复杂的时间签名，并且转录音乐也相当得心应手。所以，与其一味贬低自己，当面对赞美时，我会用不太熟悉的词汇回应，“谢谢你。”

I shift awkwardly from one leg to another and decide now would be a good time to give Rei the present.  
我尴尬地从一只脚换到另一只脚，觉得现在是给丽送礼物的好时机。

"Rei I… I got you something on the way home."  
"丽 I… 回家路上给你买了点东西。"

She looks at me in confusion as I bring the box around from my back and hand it to her. She looks at it for a moment before smiling, "You… I recognize this wrapper!"  
她困惑地看着我，我把盒子从背后拿出来递给她。她看了一会儿，然后笑了，"你… 我认得这个包装纸！"

"Yeah!" I nod, "You mentioned this place a couple of weeks ago and… well being honest I thought you seemed kinda sad this morning so I wanted to get you something to cheer you up."  
"是啊！"我点头，"几周前你提到过这家店，而且… 老实说，我觉得你今天早上有点难过，所以我想给你买点东西让你开心起来。"

"You went into the bakery and got this yourself?" She looked at me in surprise, "You were alright getting this?"  
"你自己去面包店买的这个吗？" 她惊讶地看着我，"你一个人去买的？"

I nod, "Yeah… I mean it was still scary but my session went really well and I guess that helped me not be as scared of others. It was… pretty empty in there too so I didn't have to pass too many people and like I said I wanted to cheer you up, I don't mind doing something scary if it'd help you."  
我点点头，"嗯…我是说，虽然还是有点吓人，但我的治疗进展得很顺利，我想这让我没那么害怕别人了。而且…那里面人也不多，我没遇到太多人，就像我说的，我想让你开心，如果做点吓人的事能帮到你，我就不介意。"

"Thank you!" She begins to untie the ribbon and opens it to reveal the slice of cake I've bought her. I smile as I see her eyes widen, "This looks delicious, thank you Shinji."  
"谢谢你！" 她开始解开丝带，打开包装，露出我给她买的蛋糕。我笑着看她眼睛睁大，"看起来真好吃，谢谢你，真嗣。"

"I hope you enjoy it."  
"希望你会喜欢。"

"I will." She replies, "Although I must inform you that you have nothing to be worried about regarding me. I am perfectly fine, you do not need to worry about me."  
"我会的。"" 她回答道，""不过我得告诉你，你完全不必为我担心。我一切都好，你不用担心我。"

I can tell she isn't telling the truth but I just can't bring myself to say anything else. I'm just not very good at this sort of thing, if people come to me directly and tell me they're upset then maybe… maybe I sort of know what to do but I can't get people to tell me what's wrong. If they're being evasive like… well like I would be then I simply can't do it. I'm just scared of annoying them and them being angry with me.  
我能看出她在说谎，但我就是无法再说些什么。我不擅长处理这种事情，如果人们直接来找我，告诉我他们不开心，也许……也许我大概知道该怎么做，但我无法让人们告诉我哪里不对劲。如果他们像……嗯，像我会做的那样回避话题，那我就真的无能为力了。我只是害怕惹恼他们，让他们对我生气。

So instead of saying anything else I just go back into the hallway and bring my cello and papers into the front room. I set them down behind the couch and see that Rei has already made a start on happily eating the cake. If I am going to say anything else then I should probably wait until after this, I wouldn't want to upset her now.  
于是，我没有再说什么，只是回到走廊，把我的大提琴和乐谱搬到客厅。我把它们放在沙发后面，看到丽已经开心地开始吃蛋糕了。如果我还要说什么，那最好等到这之后，我不想现在打扰她的兴致。

I sit down near to her and pull out my music player and the list of songs the instructor has given us. The idea behind the performance seems to be a brief history of music from the 18th Century onwards. This means some music I'm familiar with from the classical composers through to more modern material. I know a few of the more popular tracks but a couple I don't know, so I want to load it all onto my music player to listen to before next week.  
我坐在她旁边，拿出我的音乐播放器和导师给我们的曲目清单。这场表演的构思似乎是从 18 世纪开始的音乐简史。这意味着从古典作曲家的作品到更现代的曲目，我都有所涉猎。我知道一些比较流行的曲子，但也有几首我不熟悉，所以我打算把它们都加载到我的音乐播放器里，以便下周之前听听。

I always feel strange using this player, it's been a constant companion to me since I received it on my birthday several years ago but it's also the only thing of Asuka that remains in this place. At first I refused to use it, looking at it upset me but over time I started to think about Asuka taking the time to buy it and leave it for me. She'd be angry if I didn't use it and so I've kept it close to me at all times.  
我总觉得用这个播放器很奇怪，自从几年前生日收到它以来，它一直是我忠实的伴侣，但也是这个地方唯一留下的属于明日香的东西。起初我拒绝使用它，看着它让我心烦，但随着时间的推移，我开始思考明日香花时间买下它并留给我的情景。如果我不使用它，她会生气的，所以我一直把它带在身边。

As I search through the store and start to download each track I glance quickly at Rei and see her sat and quietly focused on eating her cake. It's so obvious to me that something is wrong, it's the same expression that I have when something is bugging me and my inability to just say something keeps eating away at me. Why do I find this so damn difficult? Misato doesn't have this difficulty, Rei doesn't and Asuka certainly didn't! What am I afraid of?  
当我浏览商店并开始下载每一首曲子时，我迅速瞥了一眼绫波，看到她静静地坐着，专心吃着她的蛋糕。对我来说，很明显有什么不对劲，那和我有烦心事时的表情一样，而我无法说出口的困扰一直在啃噬着我。为什么我觉得这他妈的这么难？美里没有这种困扰，绫波也没有，明日香当然也没有！我到底在害怕什么？

_'Being hated and abandoned by them. Losing friends and family due to saying the wrong thing. Pissing her off so she yells and leaves.'  
'被他们憎恨和抛弃。因为说错话而失去朋友和家人。惹恼她以至于她大喊大叫然后离开。'_

I hate my brain sometimes.  
我有时候真恨我的脑子。

"You are still concerned about me aren't you?" Rei suddenly speaks.  
"你还在关心我，对吧？" 丽突然开口说道。

I nod, "Yeah… You just… You look sad Rei."  
我点头，"嗯……你只是……你看起来很悲伤，丽。"

"As I said before I appreciate your concern but I am perfectly fine." Rei smiles at me, "Tell me more about the performance."  
"正如我之前所说，我非常感激你的关心，但我真的很好。" 丽微笑着对我说，"再多告诉我一些关于表演的事情吧。"

She's being evasive, I know she is because it's the exact same thing I'd try to do. I open my mouth to protest or counter it but I just can't, "Well… He wants us to learn and play tracks from classical composers through to modern artists, he seems to like a lot of rock music so I'm interested in how we're going to perform those."  
她在回避话题，我知道，因为这正是我会尝试做的事情。我张开嘴想要抗议或反驳，但我就是做不到，"嗯……他想让我们从古典作曲家到现代艺术家学习并演奏曲目，他似乎很喜欢很多摇滚音乐，所以我很好奇我们该如何表演那些。"

"Well it just be your group or will you have others accompanying you?" She asks.  
"那么，只是你们小组表演，还是会有其他人伴奏呢？" 她问道。"

I shrug, "I think it'll just be us but I'm not sure."  
我耸耸肩，“我想应该只有我们，但我不确定。”

"Then that should be interesting, I was not sure if you would be playing with an actual band or not for the songs."  
“那应该会很有趣，我不确定你是否会和真正的乐队一起演奏这些歌曲。”

"I don't think so but I think he might get someone to sing the songs." I reply, "Hey… If this does happen you and Misato will attend right?"  
“我不这么认为，但我觉得他可能会找人来唱这些歌。”我回答道，“嘿……如果这事真的发生了，你和美里会来吧？”

"I would not miss the opportunity to see my brother play for anything. Of course we will be attending."  
"我绝不会错过看我弟弟比赛的任何机会。我们当然会去。"

"Thank you." I smile, "It's a shame that…"  
"谢谢你。" 我微笑，"真是遗憾……"

I stop myself immediately from finishing that sentence. She's been on my mind a lot recently so I guess it makes sense for me to think that. I guess with finding out about Kaworu being back I've been wondering about her as well. I wonder where she is right not, I wonder if she is happy and doing well for herself.  
我立刻打住了话头。最近她一直萦绕在我心头，所以我会这么想也不奇怪。得知薰回来了，我也不禁想起了她。不知道她现在在哪里，是否幸福，过得好不好。

I look over to see Rei frowning, "I know Shinji, I would have liked that too."  
我转头看到丽皱着眉，“我知道，真嗣，我也希望如此。”

"Do you miss her too?" I ask.  
“你也想念她吗？”我问道。

Rei nods, "Yes I do."  
丽点点头，“是的，我确实想念她。”

"Is that what has been bothering you?" I ask, "I know hearing about Kaworu being back probably brought… certain things back."  
"这就是困扰你的原因吗？" 我问道，"我知道听到渚薰回来的消息可能让你想起了……某些事情。"

She looks over at me, "As I have said, there is nothing bothering me."  
她转头看向我，"正如我所说，没有什么困扰我。"

"Are you sure? You just see-"  
"你确定吗？你只是看起来——"

Rei suddenly stands up and snaps at me, "Yes! I am absolutely certain! There is nothing wrong with me at all, you do not need to keep on asking. I am going to go and shower now, thank you again for the cake."  
丽突然站起来，冲我吼道，“是的！我绝对确定！我一点问题都没有，你不需要一直问。我现在要去洗澡了，再次谢谢你的蛋糕。”

I am given no chance to reply as she moves swiftly past me and into the bathroom. I consider following her and saying something else but I know it'll only make things worse. Instead I simply sit there and silently curse myself for trying to press her further. Maybe I was wrong about the whole thing and nothing was wrong, I should have just said nothing. I guess I'm just not very good at this sort of thing.  
她迅速从我身边走过，进了浴室，我连回答的机会都没有。我想跟上去再说些什么，但我知道那只会让事情更糟。于是我只好坐在那里，默默地咒骂自己试图进一步逼问她。也许我对整件事都判断错了，其实什么问题都没有，我本该保持沉默。我想我不太擅长处理这种事情。

The best thing I can probably do now is apologize to her when she comes out. If there is something wrong then Misato can probably deal with it, she's so much better than I am. I should have spoken to her first. What did I ever think I was going to accomplish with it?  
现在我能做的最好的事可能就是等她出来后向她道歉。如果真有什么问题，美里应该能处理好，她比我强多了。我本该先和她谈谈的。我到底以为自己能通过这件事达成什么呢？

I let out a sigh and stand up to take my cello into my bedroom. As I do this I hear the sound of Rei's phone going off, I turn around to see it sat on the coffee table and wonder if I should leave it or take it to her. I listen out for the sound of running water, I can't hear anything so it seems safe to take it to her now and maybe I can apologize as well.  
我叹了口气，站起来把大提琴搬进卧室。就在这时，我听到丽手机响了，转身一看，它正躺在咖啡桌上，我犹豫着是否该把它留在那儿还是拿给她。我侧耳倾听是否有水声，什么也没听到，看来现在拿给她应该没问题，或许我还能顺便道歉。

I grab the phone from the table and the screen lights up immediately in my hand. I take a quick look at the top of the message preview just to see who it's from and I see that it is from a private number. It's likely to just be rubbish, in which case I probably shouldn't bother Rei. I quickly check the top of the message to make sure,  
我从桌上拿起手机，屏幕立刻在我手中亮起。我迅速瞥了一眼消息预览的顶部，想看看是谁发来的，结果发现是个私人号码。很可能只是垃圾信息，那样的话我或许不该打扰丽。我快速检查了一下消息顶部，确认一下，

_'Rei. It's Asuka, please call me. I know you're angry at me but you have to let me explain. I'm free all day today so just call me.'  
'丽。我是明日香，请给我回电话。我知道你在生我的气，但你必须让我解释。我今天一整天都有空，所以给我打电话吧。'_

I feel sick. My stomach is churning as I read over the message again. My head starts spinning and I feel my body start to break out in a cold sweat. My vision goes blurry as I slow my breathing and try to process just what it is I've read. That… can't be true, it has to be some sort of joke right? That can't actually be a message from Asuka.  
我感觉恶心。再次读着这条消息，我的胃在翻腾。头晕目眩，感觉身体开始冒冷汗。视线变得模糊，我放缓呼吸，试图理解我刚刚读到的东西。那……不可能是真的，一定是某种玩笑吧？那不可能是来自明日香的消息。

It just… It can't be! Why would Asuka be sending Rei a message? How could Asuka be sending Rei a message? Asuka isn't… Rei doesn't… They aren't… No… No No No No No, this doesn't make any sense damnit. This has to be a joke because if it isn't then it means something I can't believe. It means that Rei is in contact with Asuka, it means that Rei has been lying to me and Misato and… Rei wouldn't do that, would she?  
这……不可能！明日香为什么会给绫波发消息？明日香怎么会给绫波发消息？明日香不是……绫波没有……她们不是……不……不不不不不，这说不通，该死。这一定是个玩笑，如果不是的话，那就意味着我无法相信的事情。这意味着绫波和明日香有联系，这意味着绫波一直在对我们撒谎，还有……绫波不会那样做的，对吧？

Questions rush through my mind about the situation. Is this why Rei has seemed out of it for the past day? What did Asuka do? What did Rei do? How long have they been in contact? Why didn't Rei say anything to me or Misato? Rei knows how I feel about Asuka, she knows how much Asuka leaving hurt me so if she knew where Asuka is or that Asuka is alright then why didn't she tell me?  
关于这个情况的疑问在我脑海中涌动。这就是为什么绫波昨天显得心不在焉吗？明日香做了什么？绫波做了什么？她们联系多久了？为什么绫波没有告诉我们？绫波知道我对明日香的感情，她知道明日香的离开对我伤害有多大，所以如果她知道明日香在哪里或者明日香安然无恙，为什么她不告诉我？

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

I hear Rei's voice from behind me and my grip tightens on her phone. The churning in my stomach hasn't ceased and I start to fear that I might throw up. I slowly stand up straight and turn to face her. She shoots me a look of concern but then looks from my face to the phone clutched tightly in my hand.  
我听到丽在我身后喊我的名字，我握紧了她的手机。胃里的翻腾感并未消退，我开始担心自己可能会吐出来。我慢慢地站直身子，转身面对她。她投来关切的目光，然后从我的脸看到我紧握在手中的手机。

"What are you doing with my phone, is everything alright?"  
"你拿着我的手机做什么，一切都还好吗？"

"Y-Your phone… You… A message, I didn't mean to read it. I thought it was junk but…"  
"你...你的手机...有条消息，我不是故意看的。我以为是垃圾信息，但..."

"A message…" She looks at me directly in the eyes and immediately I see a look of fear spread across her face, "From who?"  
"一条消息..."" 她直视着我的眼睛，我立刻看到她脸上布满了恐惧，""谁发来的？"

"Asuka…" I reply as I feel the tears start to well up in my eyes, "I-Is it really her?"  
"是明日香..."" 我回答道，感觉到泪水开始在眼眶中打转，""真的是她吗？"

Rei looks at me and opens her mouth halfway before closing it. She looks terrified and stands silently for a moment before lowering her head, "Yes… It is."  
丽看着我，嘴巴半张后又合上了。她看起来害怕极了，静静地站了一会儿，然后低下头，"是的……确实如此。"

Her admission makes me feel like I've been punched in the gut. So it really was Asuka who sent that message, it really was her. I feel like I should be delighted that she is alright but all I feel is anger and sadness.  
她的承认让我感觉像是被重击了腹部。所以那条消息真的是明日香发的，真的是她。我本该为她的安然无恙感到高兴，但我只感到愤怒和悲伤。

"H-How long have you been in contact with her?" I ask trying to keep the tears at bay.  
"你-你们联系多久了？" 我努力忍住泪水问道。

"Just over three years…" She admits, "I… The first time I went to Europe was to track her down and I did…"  
“刚好三年多……” 她坦白道，“我……第一次去欧洲就是为了找她，我也确实找到了……”

"Track her down! You mean you've actually met her?" I raise my voice as I ask her, "For over three years you've been in contact with her and not said anything to me?"  
“找她！你是说你真的见过她？” 我提高声音问她，“三年来你一直和她有联系，却什么都没告诉我？”

Rei simply nods her head, I can see a tear rolling down her cheek, "Yes."  
丽只是点点头，我看到一滴泪珠从她的脸颊滑落，“是的。”

"Why? Why would you hide that from me Rei? Y-You knew…" My voice starts to crack with emotion, "After what happened Rei, you hid this from me? Why?"  
"为什么？为什么你要对我隐瞒这件事，丽？你明明知道……" 我的声音因情绪激动而开始颤抖，"经历了那些之后，你却对我隐瞒了这一切？为什么？"

"I… I can explain Shinji, it isn't…" She almost sobs as she speaks, "I didn't want to hide it from you."  
"我……我可以解释的，真嗣，这不是……" 她几乎哽咽地说道，"我并不想对你隐瞒。"

"But you did! Why?" "但你确实隐瞒了！为什么？"

Rei seems to hesitate for a moment, "She didn't want me to tell you… It's…"  
丽似乎犹豫了一瞬，“她不想让我告诉你……这……”

If the admission before felt like a punch to the gut this felt like a punch and a kick. I stare at Rei blankly and try to take in what she has just said. I wait for her to maybe add something else but she seems unable to do so as she stands there sobbing. I feel tears rolling down my own cheeks and anger within me, "She… didn't want you to?"  
如果说之前的坦白像是一记重拳，那么现在感觉就像是一拳加一脚。我茫然地盯着丽，试图消化她刚刚说的话。我等待她或许会补充些什么，但她似乎无法再说下去，只是站在那里哭泣。我感到泪水从自己的脸颊滑落，内心充满了愤怒，“她……不想让你说？”

Rei shakes her head, "I wanted to but…"  
丽摇了摇头，“我想说，但是……”

"Then why didn't you?" I yell back at her, "I'm supposed to be your brother! You knew… You knew how I felt about her and you hid this from me! All those times you spoke about missing her and how bad you felt about her leaving and you were speaking to her all along."  
"那你为什么不告诉我？" 我朝她吼道，"我应该是你哥哥！你知道……你知道我对她的感情，你却对我隐瞒这一切！那些你谈论想念她、对她离开感到多么糟糕的时刻，你其实一直在和她说话。"

"I-I know…" "我……我知道……"

"I trusted you Rei… I thought I thought I could trust you but you… You betrayed me, you're… you're just like him!"  
"我信任你，丽……我以为我可以信任你，但你……你背叛了我，你……你就像他一样！"

"Shinji please!" "真嗣，求你了！"

"No!" I shout back at her, "Just… Leave me alone."  
"不行！"" 我朝她吼回去，""就……让我一个人待着。"

I barge my way past her and back into the hallway. I have to leave, I have to get out of this apartment, I don't know where but I just know I have to get far away from here. Behind me I hear her call out and sob but I ignore it as I shove a pair of shoes on and rush out of the front door. I wipe away the tears from my eyes and run from the apartment as quickly as I can. I rush down the stairs and out onto the street, I jog onto another street and into a nearby alleyway to stop for a moment. My stomach is still churning and I worry for a brief moment that I might throw up but I manage to stop myself.  
我推开她，冲回走廊。我必须离开，必须逃离这个公寓，我不知道去哪儿，但我知道我必须远离这里。我听到她在身后呼喊和哭泣，但我置若罔闻，匆匆穿上鞋子，冲出前门。我擦去眼中的泪水，尽可能快地逃离公寓。我冲下楼梯，跑到街上，又跑进另一条街，钻进附近的一条小巷，停下来喘口气。我的胃还在翻腾，有那么一会儿我担心自己会吐出来，但我设法忍住了。

I look back towards the alleyway entrance to see if anyone has followed me. No one has, at least not yet. I take a moment to try to think about what has just happened. Rei found Asuka three years ago and has been in contact with her ever since. I still can't believe she would do that and not tell me, I think about what she said about Asuka not wanting her to tell me about it. Why would Rei agree to that?  
我回头望向小巷入口，看看是否有人跟踪我。目前还没有，至少现在没有。我花了一点时间试图思考刚刚发生的事情。丽三年前找到了明日香，并且一直与她保持联系。我仍然无法相信她会这么做却不告诉我，我想起了她关于明日香不希望她告诉我这件事的说法。丽为什么会同意呢？

I just don't understand and I don't think I want to. I just want to get away from here. I check my pockets and see I've got my transport cards and phone with me. I have to get away from this place and this. I need to be alone where no one can find me and work this out. I need to get away from Rei.  
我就是不明白，也不认为我想明白。我只想离开这里。我检查了一下口袋，发现我的交通卡和手机都在。我必须离开这个地方，离开这一切。我需要独自一人，没有人能找到我，好好理清这一切。我需要远离丽。

**16th September 2021 – Early Evening - Kaworu's Apartment  
2021 年 9 月 16 日 – 傍晚时分 - 渚薰的公寓**

This is a situation that I never expected myself to be in. It isn't even because of the person who I'm sat with but just because I never saw myself doing something like this. I could never see myself being the sort of person who would be sat cuddling with someone on a couch. I was so convinced that I was best off being alone, that I isolated myself from even pursuing that sort of thing.  
这种境况，我从未预料到自己会置身其中。并非因为与我同坐之人，而是我从未想过自己会做这样的事。我无法想象自己会成为那种坐在沙发上与某人依偎的人。我一直深信独处最佳，甚至自我隔离，不去追求此类亲密。

The idea of it, well I guess it appealed to me. I've never really longed for closeness, I don't think I'll ever be an especially touchy-feely kind of person but I know how nice it can feel to just be hugged by something. I suppose that's why I always appreciated seeing Rei, she is someone who enjoys hugging people and it always felt nice, it was that confirmation that someone cared.  
这种想法，嗯，我想它吸引了我。我从未真正渴望过亲密，我不认为自己会成为特别喜欢肢体接触的人，但我知道被拥抱的感觉有多美好。我想这就是为什么我总是欣赏看到丽，她是个喜欢拥抱别人的人，那种感觉总是很美好，那是有人在乎的确认。

Strangely though I'm not the one being held right now. Instead it is Kaworu who I'm holding in my arms and who is cuddling up to me. I'm the one running my hand through his soft silvery hair whilst he lies on the couch. To someone more traditional it probably looks weird but I don't care, I'm not a traditional person and it's just nice to have him close to me regardless of who is cuddling who.  
奇怪的是，现在并非我被拥抱。反而是我怀抱着薰，他依偎着我。我轻抚着他柔软的银色发丝，而他躺在沙发上。对更传统的人来说，这或许看起来怪异，但我不在乎，我不是传统的人，只要他在我身边，谁拥抱谁都无所谓，感觉很好。

Unfortunately, this moment of bliss is broken when I begin to feel my phone ring in my pocket. Kaworu immediately lifts himself up off of me and smiles at me, "You should answer that, it could be Rei."  
遗憾的是，这份幸福时刻被我口袋里手机的铃声打破。Kaworu 立刻从我身上起身，微笑着对我说：“你应该接那个电话，可能是 Rei 打来的。”

I nod, "Yeah... I know, I'll take it in your bedroom."  
我点头，“嗯...我知道，我去你卧室接。”

I get up and leave the comfort of the couch and the warmth of Kaworu behind and slip into the bedroom. I pull out my phone and see that it is indeed Rei and my chest tightens in anticipation. I know I asked her to call me so I should have expected it but I have no idea what she or I am going to say. The way in which she hung up yesterday and the tone of the message she sent me, she seemed so angry and a small part of me can't blame her for that.  
我起身离开舒适的沙发和 Kaworu 的温暖，悄悄走进卧室。我拿出手机，发现确实是 Rei 打来的，我的心不由得紧张起来。我知道我让她打电话给我，本应有所预料，但我完全不知道她或我会说什么。昨天她挂断电话的方式和她发给我的信息中的语气，她显得那么生气，我内心的一小部分无法责怪她。

I know exactly how she feels about Kaworu and her need to protect Shinji from being hurt. I know she sees Kaworu as an enemy and someone who caused nothing but pain and so the idea of me being a friend to Kaworu was bad enough, never mind me kissing him or being more than friends.  
我完全理解她对渚薰的感受以及她保护真嗣不受伤害的必要性。我知道她把渚薰视为敌人，一个只会带来痛苦的人，所以对我成为渚薰的朋友这件事已经够糟糕了，更别提我还亲吻了他，甚至关系更进一步。

At the same time, I can't help but feel some annoyance with Rei. She didn't give me a chance to explain what had happened properly before hanging up. She doesn't seem to understand my side of things in this, does she really think that I'd be friends with or kiss someone who causes her and Shinji so much pain? She knows I care about Shinji and don't want to see him hurt myself. If I had even the slightest suspicion that Kaworu might not be what I say he is does she really think I'd be doing this?  
与此同时，我对绫波也感到有些恼火。她没给我机会好好解释发生了什么就挂了电话。她似乎不理解我的立场，难道她真的认为我会和那个给绫波和真嗣带来如此多痛苦的人做朋友或亲吻他吗？她知道我关心真嗣，也不想看到他受伤。如果我有丝毫怀疑渚薰可能不是我所说的那样，她真的认为我会这么做吗？

I realize though that I should tread carefully regarding the subject. From now on I should probably not mention the fact that we kissed or my feelings for him. I certainly shouldn't mention that we spent most of yesterday afternoon making out with each other on his couch, nor should I mention that that is pretty much how we've spent this evening.  
不过我意识到，关于这个话题我应该谨慎行事。从今往后，我可能最好不要提及我们接吻的事实或我对他的感情。当然，我也不应该提到昨天下午我们大部分时间都在他的沙发上亲热，更不应该提到今晚我们基本上也是这样度过的。

I ready myself to answer the phone and wonder if her anger will have subsided. As I mentioned before, Rei can be stubborn. I've never really seen her angry before but I know she can hold grudges against people who hurt her even if it is something simple. I remember a time she refused to speak to Misato for a fortnight after some of Misato's cooking made her ill.  
我准备好接电话，不知道她的怒气是否已经平息。正如之前所说，丽是个固执的人。我从未真正见过她生气，但我知道她会对伤害她的人怀恨在心，哪怕只是小事。我记得有一次，她因为美里的一些烹饪让她生病了，整整两周都没和美里说话。

So, I'm apprehensive as I answer the phone wondering if this is the phonecall that ends our friendship. I take a deep breath, "Hello?"  
因此，我忐忑不安地接起电话，不知道这是否会是结束我们友谊的电话。我深吸一口气，“喂？”

What I'm greeted by surprises no, no it actually frightens me because it isn't Rei's soft voice that I hear replying to me, it isn't the angry sounding Rei that hung up on me yesterday. Instead I'm greeted by a loud sob followed by a hysterical sounding Rei, _"A-Asuka... Asuka..."_  
电话那头的声音让我惊讶，不，实际上是吓到了我，因为那不是丽温柔的声音回应我，也不是昨天挂断电话时那个愤怒的丽。相反，我听到的是一声响亮的抽泣，接着是歇斯底里的丽，“明日香...明日香...”

My chest tightens some more, "Rei? Is everything alright?"  
我的胸口越发紧绷，“丽？一切都好吗？”

I silently curse myself for asking such a stupid question. I can almost hear my older self-taunting me. '_What are you, stupid? Of course, she isn't alright, she's sobbing down the phone at you!'_  
我暗自咒骂自己问了个这么蠢的问题。几乎能听到过去的自己在嘲讽我。‘你是不是傻？当然不好，她在电话那头对着你哭呢！’

As I hear another sob I realize there is something about hearing Rei cry like this scares me. Rei doesn't express emotion like this, her expression is slight and quiet. Subtle shifts in tone or the way she looks, she isn't outward like this. Many might mistake Rei for being emotionless but of course being her friend and knowing her like I do I can notice things. It's not like I haven't seen her cry before, she cried when I showed her my book and the character based on her for the first time and she cried when she confided in me about a former partner.  
当又一声啜泣传来，我意识到听到丽这样哭泣让我感到害怕。丽不这样表达情感，她的表达是微妙而安静的。语调的细微变化或她看人的方式，她不像这样外露。许多人可能会误以为丽没有感情，但作为她的朋友，像我这样了解她，我能注意到这些细节。并不是说我没见过她哭，她第一次看到我书里以她为原型的角色时哭了，她向我倾诉前伴侣的事时也哭了。

So, I'm frightened right now because I don't know what could have brought this on because this is not a subtle shift, this is a full-on torrent.  
所以，我现在很害怕，因为我不知道是什么导致了这一切，这不是一个微妙的变化，这是一场彻底的洪流。

_"A-Asuka... I... Something... Something bad... I... I don't know what to do... Shinji... He... He saw and... I did something bad... I'm a bad person Asuka... I'm sorry... I couldn't... I'm sorry... I'm Sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry."  
“绫波...我...有件事...很糟糕的事...我...我不知道该怎么办...真嗣...他...他看到了而且...我做了坏事...我是个坏人，绫波...对不起...我做不到...对不起...对不起对不起对不起。”_

Shinji... She said Shinji's name! My heart leaps into my throat and that feeling of fear grows. I rise up from the edge of the bed slowly. Has something happened to Shinji? I can barely make out what Rei is saying through her sobs but she said she did something bad. She couldn't have hurt him, could she? No, that's stupid, she isn't capable of that.  
真嗣...她提到了真嗣的名字！我的心跳到了嗓子眼，那种恐惧感愈发强烈。我慢慢地从床边站起来。真嗣出什么事了吗？我几乎听不清绫波在哭泣中说什么，但她说了她做了坏事。她不可能伤害他，对吧？不，那太蠢了，她不会做那种事的。

"Rei, please slow down, you're not making any sense." I try to calm the poor girl down and figure out what the hell has happened.  
"丽，请慢点说，你这样讲不清楚。" 我试图让这可怜的女孩平静下来，弄明白到底发生了什么。

_"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."  
"对不起。对不起。对不起。"_

"REI!" I raise my voice to try to stop her from apologizing.  
"丽！" 我提高声音，试图阻止她不停地道歉。

_I'm sorry!" 对不起！_

"WONDERGIRL!" I raise my voice again and this time it seems to get through to her and she stops, "Will you please calm down and tell me what the hell has happened!"  
"神奇女孩！" 我再次提高声音，这次似乎起了作用，她停了下来，"请你冷静下来，告诉我到底发生了什么事！"

I hear a small sniff from the other end of the line as she seemed to try and compose herself. It's at least a minute of hearing her sniffing before she speaks again, _"I... Yes... Yes I... I will try, I'm sorry."_  
我听到电话那头传来轻微的抽泣声，她似乎在努力平复情绪。至少过了一分钟，我听到她不断抽泣，然后她再次开口，"我... 是的... 是的，我... 我会试试，对不起。"

"Yeah, you've made it quite clear that you're sorry!" I say sternly, "Now, what has happened Rei?"  
"是啊，你已经很清楚地表明了你的歉意！" 我严肃地说，"那么，丽，发生了什么事？"

I hear another sniff but she at least seems to have composed herself now and can speak to me. I wait for her to tell me what has happened with some apprehension. I fear to think about what could have causes Rei of all people to be in such a state.  
我又听到了一声抽泣，但她至少现在似乎已经平静下来，能够和我说话了。我带着些许不安等待她告诉我发生了什么。我不敢想象是什么事情能让丽这样的人陷入如此状态。

_"Me and Shinji… Had an argument. I was out of the room and your message came through, he… saw it when he went to give my phone to me."  
"我和真嗣……吵了一架。我离开了房间，你的消息发过来了，他……在我去拿手机的时候看到了。"_

_Shit._

"So… Shinji knows about me?"  
"所以…真嗣知道我的事了？"

_"Yes." "是的。"_

I let out a sigh and shake my head, so that must be what has caused all of this. Shinji found out that Rei knew about me. I wonder just how much he knows, I wonder what she has told him and how she told him. I can only imagine how the poor idiot has reacted to all of this. I know he hates the idea of people lying to him and this… this is one hell of a thing to keep from him.  
我叹了口气，摇摇头，看来这就是这一切的起因了。真嗣发现丽知道我的事。我不知道他究竟了解多少，她又告诉了他什么，以及她是如何告诉他的。我只能想象那个可怜的傻瓜对此会有什么反应。我知道他讨厌别人对他隐瞒真相，而这件事…这真是一个天大的秘密。

_"I am so sorry."_ Rei speaks again, _"I know you wished for this to be kept secret and I have failed to do that for you."_  
"我真的很抱歉。" 丽再次开口，"我知道你希望这件事保密，而我没能为你做到。"

"No." I shake my head again and for some reason I actually smile, "It's okay Rei, you didn't fail. It… Wasn't your fault, now tell me what happened, from the beginning."  
"不。" 我再次摇头，不知为何我竟然笑了，"没关系，丽，你没有失败。这……不是你的错，现在告诉我发生了什么，从头开始。"

"Okay." I hear her take a few breathes of her own to steady herself, "After I… got angry yesterday I had been unable to shake that. I had been questioning whether I was right to be upset and the entire situation. Shinji… noticed that something was wrong with me. He… continued to ask if I was alright and so I got annoyed with him."  
"好的。" 我听到她深呼吸几次以平复心情，"昨天我……生气之后，就一直无法摆脱那种情绪。我一直在质疑自己是否应该生气，以及整个情况。真嗣……注意到我不对劲。他……不停地问我是否还好，所以我对他感到烦躁。"

"Understandable." I nod. "可以理解。" 我点头。

"Perhaps but… he was right to be concerned about me. Yet I could not tell him because of what it was regarding."  
"或许吧，但他担心我是对的。只是我不能告诉他原因。"

"Of course." I agree, "So what happened after you got annoyed."  
"当然。" 我同意，"那你生气之后发生了什么？"

"I went to take a shower but I realized I had forgotten my phone to listen to some music. When I went back into the front room to get it I saw that Shinji had it in his hand. I had just received your message and he was going to bring the phone to me but he… had already seen the message at that point."  
我去洗澡，却发现忘了带手机听音乐。回到客厅拿手机时，看到真嗣手里正拿着它。我刚收到你的消息，他正要给我送手机，但他……那时已经看到了那条消息。

"I see." “我明白了。”

I hear Rei start to cry softly again as this entire scene runs through my mind. My own carelessness has caused this. I put my name in the message thinking that only Rei would see it. I went against what we agreed again. I am the reason for Rei being so upset right now and also the reason that Shinji is… doing whatever Shinji does when he is upset.  
我听到丽又开始轻轻地哭泣，脑海中浮现出整个场景。我的粗心大意导致了这一切。我以为只有丽会看到消息，所以在里面写上了我的名字。我又一次违背了我们的约定。丽现在如此难过，真嗣……也在做他难过时会做的事，这一切都是我的错。

It's weird but whilst I feel bad for Rei and Shinji I also feel a strange sense of relief that Shinji knows about me. I was always putting off getting back in contact with them, waiting to say the right thing or compose the right message. Perhaps even waiting for them to seek me out first. I was always putting it off though and stretching this lie out. It happening this way seems sort of apt for who I am and it feels like this weight has been lifted from my shoulders.  
虽然我对丽和真嗣感到抱歉，但同时也感到一种奇怪的解脱，因为真嗣知道了我的存在。我一直推迟与他们重新联系，等待着说出合适的话或构思完美的信息，甚至期待他们先来找我。我总是拖延，把这个谎言拉长。以这种方式发生，似乎正适合我的性格，感觉肩上的重担被卸下了。

At the same time that weight has been replaced by a new one. The weight of guilt at what my actions have caused. This situation is my fault, I have no doubt about that. If I hadn't have asked her to keep that stupid promise, if I had have sent the e-mail sooner and not been a coward then this could have been avoided. I have to put this right, I have to fix this.  
与此同时，旧的重担已被新的所取代。我因自己的行为所造成的罪恶感沉重地压在心头。这种情况是我的错，对此我毫不怀疑。如果我没有让她坚守那个愚蠢的承诺，如果我能早点发送那封邮件而不是懦弱地拖延，这一切本可以避免。我必须纠正这个错误，我必须解决这个问题。

_"I am so sorry that I have let you down Asuka."  
“我很抱歉，明日香，我让你失望了。”_

"Rei… You haven't let me down. Don't worry about it, this is… this is all my fault. I should never have asked you to do this in the first place and… well I have been careless recently. Something was bound to go wrong wasn't it? I mean… this is me we're talking about, when doesn't it go wrong?"  
“绫波……你没有让我失望。别担心，这都是……这都是我的错。我一开始就不该要求你这么做，而且……我最近确实疏忽大意了。总会有事情出错的，不是吗？我是说……我们谈论的是我，什么时候不出错了？”

To my relief I actually hear a small chuckle from Rei, _"Please… do not say that. You do a lot of good things and deserve to have good things happen to you as well."_  
令我宽慰的是，我确实听到了丽的一声轻笑，“请……不要这么说。你做了很多好事，也理应得到好报。”

"Well what I do and deserve doesn't matter right now, this is about you and Shinji. What did he say to you when he found out?"  
“好吧，我做什么、应得什么现在都不重要，关键是关于你和真嗣。他发现后对你说了什么？”

_"He asked me how long I had been in contact with you and how. I told him what I could but he did not give me the opportunity to explain. He… did not take any of it well, he left but before he left he said that… I was just like our father."  
“他问我与你联系多久了，怎么联系的。我尽量告诉他我所知道的，但他没给我解释的机会。他……对此反应很糟糕，离开前他说……我和我们的父亲一样。”_

I feel something snap inside of me as I hear Rei speak those words to me. Shinji… he actually said that to her? He actually accused her of being like that? The idiot! How dare he compare Rei to that bastard! After all she has done for him, after all the times she has been there for him, all the night she has spent caring for him! After all she has been through herself how dare he say such a horrible thing to her!  
听到丽对我说出那些话，我感到内心有什么东西断裂了。真嗣……他真的对她说了那样的话？他真的指责她像那样？这个白痴！他怎么敢把丽和那个混蛋相提并论！在她为他做了那么多之后，在她无数次陪伴他之后，在她无数个夜晚照顾他之后！在她自己经历了那么多之后，他怎么敢对她说出如此可怕的话！

"HE SAID WHAT?" I yell and instantly regret it, Rei is upset enough without me yelling.  
“他说了什么？”我大喊道，立刻就后悔了，丽已经够难过了，我不该再大喊大叫。

I hear Rei sniff again, _"He said that… I was just like our father. I… I deserved it, he is right… I hid…"_  
我又听到丽吸了吸鼻子，“他说……我和我们的父亲一样。我……我活该，他说得对……我逃避了……”

"NO!" I cut her off immediately, "You listen to me Rei… You are nothing like that pathetic excuse for a human. I don't care how mad Shinji is or was, he had no right to say that to you. You are a good person and you have done absolutely nothing wrong. This thing… it's my fault. So… I'm going to put this right."  
"不！" 我立刻打断她，"丽，你听着……你绝不是那种可悲的人类。不管真嗣有多生气，他都没有权利那样说你。你是个好人，你一点错都没有。这件事……是我的错。所以……我会纠正它。"

_"H-How?"_ She asks me. "怎-怎么？" 她问我。

Good question, I think to myself and try to think about what, if anything I can do. Eventually an idea forms in my mind, I didn't quite expect to be doing this but… to hell with it. Going to have to go all in at this point.  
好问题，我暗自思忖，试图思考我能做些什么。最终一个主意在我脑海中形成，我没想到自己会这么做，但……管他呢。现在只能全力以赴了。

"Did Shinji take his phone with him?"  
"真嗣带手机了吗？"

_"Yes… I believe he did."  
"是的…我想他带了。"_

"Okay…" I sigh, "Send me his number and I'll call him and speak to him. You… You go and calm yourself down okay. Go and have a bath and a cup of tea, go and do whatever it is you do to calm yourself and I'll sort this out. When does Misato come home?"  
"好吧…" 我叹了口气，"把他的号码发给我，我来打电话跟他谈谈。你…你去冷静一下，好吗？去洗个澡，喝杯茶，做些让你平静下来的事情，我来处理这件事。美里什么时候回家？"

_"Not until later this evening."  
"要到今晚晚些时候。"_

"Okay good, I'll get this sorted before she comes home." I sit myself back down on the bed and idly play with the edge of one of the pillows, "I'll speak to him, I'll calm him down and explain the entire thing. I'll sort this out."  
"好的，太好了，我会在她回家前处理好这件事。"" 我重新坐回床上，无聊地摆弄着其中一个枕头的边缘，""我会和他谈谈，我会让他冷静下来并解释整个事情。我会解决这个问题的。"

_"No… You do not need to. This is my fault! I ha-"  
"不……你不需要这么做。这是我的错！我……"_

"Rei!" I cut her off sternly. It's perhaps inappropriate but I realize with some amusement just how much she actually sounds like her brother when she is upset, "Believe me… I do have to do this, I should have spoken to him a long time ago. I shouldn't have asked you to do any of this so just… let me speak to him. I'll put the idiot straight and get him home to you."  
"丽!" 我严厉地打断了她。或许这不太合适，但我有些好笑地意识到，她生气时听起来和她哥哥有多么相似，"相信我……我确实得这么做，我早该和他谈谈了。我不该让你掺和进来，所以……让我和他谈谈。我会把那个笨蛋说通，让他回家找你。"

_"Do you think you'll be able to?"_ She asks me, her voice still trembling as she speaks.  
"你觉得你能做到吗？" 她问我，声音依旧颤抖着。

"I'm Asuka Langley Soryu! Of course I'll be able to!" I speak confidently, admittedly I'm not completely confident I will be able to but I have to try.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！当然能做到！" 我自信地说道，虽然说实话我并没有完全的把握，但我必须尝试。

_"Okay… Thank you Asuka. Thank you so much, I'll… send you the details."  
"好的……谢谢你，明日香。非常感谢，我会……把详细信息发给你。"_

"Good, I'll talk to you later then, you… just go and releax."  
"很好，那我们晚点再聊，你……先去放松一下吧。"

_"Yes. I will." "好的，我会的。"_

"Goodbye." “再见。”

I hand up the phone and sit for a brief moment in silence trying to think about what I'll say to Shinji. I'm given barely any chance to think about it before Kaworu enters the room with a worried look on his face, "Is everything okay Asuka, I heard shouting?"  
我挂断电话，静静地坐了一会儿，试图思考如何对真嗣说。还没等我想清楚，渚就带着担忧的表情走进房间，“一切都好吗，明日香，我听到你在喊叫？”

I shake my head at him and let out a laugh, "No… Everything isn't alright…"  
我对他摇了摇头，苦笑道，“不……一切都不太好……”

He looks at me in confusion, "I do not understand, how come you are laughing?"  
他困惑地看着我，“我不明白，你怎么会笑呢？”

"Because it's… absurd." I shrug, "Because… despite it being alright I also feel relieved I guess. Shinji… Knows about me now, he saw the message I sent to Rei and… she told him about us being in contact for the past few years."  
“因为这…太荒谬了。”我耸耸肩，“因为…尽管一切似乎都还好，我也感到松了一口气吧。真嗣…现在知道我了，他看到了我发给绫的消息，而且…绫也告诉他我们这几年来一直在联系。”

"Oh… I see." Kaworu kneels down in front of me and reached up to cup my cheek with his hand, "Are you alright?"  
“哦…我明白了。”薰在我面前跪下，伸手捧住我的脸颊，“你还好吗？”

"Yeah… Well… Sort of, I feel relieved that he finally knows but the way he found out has… caused them to argue. So I… have to sort that out."  
"是啊……嗯……算是吧，我感到松了一口气，因为他终于知道了，但他发现的方式……导致了他们争吵。所以我……得解决这个问题。"

"They argued?" He asks. "他们吵起来了？" 他问道。"

"Yup, Shinji… didn't take the news well. Not entirely unexpected, he saw it as Rei lying to him and didn't really give her a chance to explain. I can't exactly blame him but he said something pretty bad to Rei, he said she was like their father."  
"没错，真嗣……对这消息反应不佳。虽然并不完全出乎意料，他认为绫波在对他撒谎，并没有真正给她解释的机会。我不能完全怪他，但他对绫波说了些很难听的话，他说她像他们的父亲。"

Kaworu lowers his eyes at me saying this, "I see… I can understand why that would be upsetting. I would also dislike being compared to those who might be considered my parents. It would be… very hurtful."  
听到我这么说，渚薰垂下眼帘，“我明白了……我能理解为什么这会让人难过。我也不喜欢被拿来与那些可能被视为我父母的人相比。那会……非常伤人。”

"Yeah… Bring up parents for any of us is a bit of a no go area." I bring my own hand up at his point and run it through Kaworu's hair and cup his cheek, "So I'm going to speak to him."  
“是啊……对我们任何人来说，提到父母都是个禁区。”我在这个时候抬起自己的手，穿过渚薰的头发，轻抚他的脸颊，“所以我要去跟他谈谈。”

"What are you going to say?"  
“你要说什么？”

"I'm not sure yet. I guess I'll just have to explain it all to him and fix this thing between him and Rei." I frown, "I kinda want to yell at him for what he said but… I don't think that'll be a good idea."  
"我还不确定。我想我得向他解释清楚，修复他和丽之间的关系。" 我皱眉，"我有点想对他大吼，因为他说的那些话，但是……我觉得那样做不太好。"

Kaworu smiles, "No, Shinji is… fragile and likely to be in a lot of pain. I do not think it would help."  
渚薰微笑道，"不，真嗣他……很脆弱，可能正承受着很多痛苦。我觉得那样做不会有帮助。"

I smile back at him, "I will however have to be honest with him and tell him that he shouldn't have said that. I'll remind him of how much Rei cares for him and what she has done for him. I think… the problem is that Misato and Rei have gone from ignoring his issues too much to being afraid to push him and be tough with him."  
我对他回以微笑，"不过，我确实得诚实地告诉他，他不该那么说。我会提醒他丽有多关心他，她为他做了多少。我想……问题是，美里和丽从对他的问题视而不见到现在害怕推动他，不敢对他严厉。"

"And you do not fear that?" Kaworu grins at me.  
"你不怕吗？" 渚薰对我微笑着。

"Of course not, I wasn't afraid to be tough with you… was I?" I pull his face towards me and kiss him softly on the lips. As we kiss I feel Kaworu's hand slide down to my shoulder and gently start to push me backwards onto the bad. I let him guide my body as he brings himself up onto the bed and positions himself over me.  
"当然不怕，我可不怕对你强硬……不是吗？" 我拉近他的脸，轻轻吻上他的唇。我们亲吻时，我感觉到渚薰的手从我的肩膀滑下，温柔地推着我向后倒在床上。我任由他引导我的身体，他将自己撑起，压在我上方。

Our tongues dance as I feel the warmth and weight of his body on top of mine, I feel his hand go from my shoulder and run itself along the side of my body. I feel my body react appropriately to his passion and I can also feel his body reacting to it. I let my hands explore his body, one running along his back and the other firmly on his backside.  
我们的舌头交缠，我感受到他身体的温暖与重量，他的手从我的肩膀滑过我的侧身。我的身体自然而然地回应着他的热情，同时也能感受到他的身体对此的反应。我让双手在他身上游走，一只手沿着他的背脊滑动，另一只手则紧紧地按在他的臀部。

Unfortunately our impromptu make out session is broken when I hear my phone go off. I break the kiss and push him away playfully, "Guess it'll have to wait Angel Boy, I've got a phone call to make."  
不幸的是，我们的即兴亲热被我的手机铃声打断了。我中断了这个吻，开玩笑地推开他，“看来得等等了，天使男孩，我得打个电话。”

### Chapter 10: Only When I Feel  
第十章：唯有当我感受到  

**Tokyo-2 Outskirts – Shinji Ikari  
东京-2 郊区 – 碇真嗣**

I quietly mumble a thank you to the driver as I step off the bus and put my headphone back into my ears. The sound of cicadas gives way to the music of Beethoven as I stumble forward slight, my legs slightly stiff from nearly an hour of no movement. I pause for a moment in the bus shelter and feel tears burning at the backs of my eyes once more.  
我轻声向司机道谢，下了公交车，重新将耳机塞入耳中。蝉鸣声被贝多芬的音乐取代，我踉跄前行，双腿因近一个小时的静止而略显僵硬。我在公交车站停了一会儿，再次感到泪水在眼眶后燃烧。

I could let them fall here, there aren't any people around to see me. This was the last stop for the bus before it went to the next town and it was so very hard to stay composed throughout the journey here. There were moments that I didn't think I've be able to keep it together but I had to. As long as there were people around I wouldn't be able to cry.  
我可以让他们在这里坠落，周围没有人会看到我。这是公交车前往下一个城镇之前的最后一站，而在这段旅程中保持镇定是如此艰难。有好几次，我以为自己无法坚持下去，但我必须这么做。只要有人在身边，我就无法哭泣。

As I step out of the shelter I realize I don't really have anywhere to go tonight. I can't really go home now. Not with Rei there waiting for me, not after what she has done and not after what I've said. I can't go to see my friends, they simply wouldn't understand or they'd worry too much about me.  
当我走出避难所时，我意识到今晚我无处可去。我现在真的不能回家。不是因为丽在那里等我，不是因为她所做的一切，也不是因为我说过的话。我也不能去找我的朋友，他们根本不会理解，或者他们会为我担心太多。

There was a brief moment when I was deciding what to do that I considered going to a bar and getting completely drunk. I actually considered just going in and drinking until I didn't feel any of this pain anymore. For a minute or two the idea did appeal to me until I realized how I'd probably end up, I've seen Misato do similar things in the past after all. So when I stood outside the bar I just couldn't bring myself to do it, besides I don't really like the taste of alcohol anyway.  
在决定该做什么的时候，我曾短暂地考虑过去酒吧喝个烂醉。我确实想过走进去，喝到感觉不到任何痛苦为止。有那么一两分钟，这个想法确实吸引了我，但当我意识到自己可能会变成什么样子时，我就放弃了，毕竟我见过美里过去也做过类似的事情。所以当我站在酒吧外时，我就是无法让自己进去，再说我也不太喜欢酒精的味道。

So I've come to this place instead, right now I'm at the foot of a large hill that looks over the city of Tokyo-2. It's late in the day, just at the point that the sun is starting to set so there will be very few, if any, people around to see me. That's good, right at this moment I just want to be on my own, I want to be away from everyone and everything.  
所以我来到了这个地方，此刻我正站在一座俯瞰东京-2 市的大山脚下。天色已晚，太阳刚刚开始落山，周围几乎没有人，如果有也很少，这样就不会有人注意到我。这很好，就在这一刻，我只想独自一人，远离所有人，远离一切。

The track changes in my ears and I start to walk up the hill until I reach a small clearing that seems to have been set aside as a little picnic area. Whoever was here earlier today has left some of their trash behind and I move past it to a small scattering of nearby rocks. I prop myself up against once of the rocks and look out over the vast skyline of the city.  
耳机里的音乐换了一首，我开始向山上走去，直到到达一个小空地，似乎被留作一个小野餐区。今天早些时候在这里的人留下了一些垃圾，我绕过它们，走到附近散落的几块石头旁。我靠在其中一块石头上，眺望着城市的广阔天际线。

I've done this before, many years ago in a city that no longer exists. It was just after I had defeated the fourth Angel. During the battle I had disobeyed Misato's ordered, when confronted by her I acted like a brat. I felt she was only using me as a tool, I felt like they all were, I felt like all they cared about was getting me into that damn Eva so I could defeat the Angels. What did I matter to them?  
我以前也这样做过，很多年前在一个不复存在的城市。那是在我击败第四使徒之后不久。在那场战斗中，我违抗了美里小姐的命令，当她质问我时，我表现得像个孩子。我觉得她只是把我当作工具，我觉得他们都是这样，我觉得他们只关心让我进入那该死的 EVA，好让我击败使徒。他们对我有什么意义呢？

I was wrong, at least… for the most part I was. Misato… She did care but I didn't make it easy and… I cared about her but she certainly didn't make it easy. There were other factors in my decision to run away then though. I had just seen my father for the first time in years and he was just as he always was, cold… distant and clearly didn't care about me. In school I had just been attacked for something that wasn't my fault, yet I blamed myself for it anyway.  
我错了，至少……大部分时候我是错的。美里……她确实关心我，但我没让她好过，而且……我也关心她，但她绝对没让我好过。不过，我决定逃跑还有其他因素。我刚刚多年后第一次见到我父亲，他一如既往地冷漠……疏远，显然并不在乎我。在学校里，我因为一件不是我的错的事情被攻击，尽管如此，我还是把责任归咎于自己。

It was all too much, there were too many things in my mind and I just had to get away from it. I had to isolate myself and just run. I wandered Tokyo-3 for an entire evening, sleeping in an all-night cinema and on a bench. I got on the trains and buses as far as I could until I found myself out of the city. I could have kept going but… I didn't have the nerve to or… maybe I didn't want to.  
这一切都太沉重了，我脑海中有太多事情，我必须逃离这一切。我必须孤立自己，只是逃跑。我在东京-3 游荡了整整一个晚上，睡在通宵电影院和长椅上。我尽可能地乘坐火车和公交车，直到发现自己离开了城市。我本可以继续前行，但……我没有那个勇气，或者……也许是我不想。

I ended up walking around some of the countryside and I encountered Kensuke. I thought he was odd at first, now I don't think he's odd, I know he is odd. Back then he was a military otaku, obsessed with the armed forces and even more so with the Eva's. He always used to say I was lucky back then, he wanted to pilot an Eva so badly. That changed after Third Impact, he actually apologized to me. He still loves the way the Eva's were and how powerful they were but he said he'd never want to go near one.  
我最终在乡间漫步，偶遇了 Kensuke。起初我觉得他很古怪，现在我不只是觉得，而是确信他确实古怪。那时他是个军事宅，对武装部队着迷，对 Eva 更是痴迷不已。他总是说我那时很幸运，他非常渴望能驾驶一台 Eva。但在第三次冲击之后，他向我道歉了。他依然热爱 Eva 的强大，但他说他再也不想靠近它们了。

I let out a sigh as I sit myself down on the ground and continue to look out over the city. It's quiet and peaceful here, if I wasn't feeling so bad right now I'd like to come here on an evening and look at the stars. As it is all I can do is thinking about the reason I've ran. I almost expect to hear her calling after me to be honest. I don't think Rei followed me though, I think I was gone before she had a chance to come after me.  
我叹了口气，坐到地上，继续眺望城市。这里安静而平和，如果不是现在心情如此糟糕，我真想在某个晚上来这里看星星。实际上，我只能想着逃跑的原因。老实说，我几乎期待听到她在后面呼唤我。不过我不认为 Rei 跟来了，我觉得我离开得太快，她还没来得及追上来。

A part of me still can't quite believe it and yet I know it's the truth. Rei has been in contact with Asuka for over three years. She has kept this hidden from me for all that time. She has visited Asuka, she has spent time with her and in all that time she has kept up this façade of missing her and pretending to not know anything.  
我的一部分仍然难以置信，然而我知道这是事实。丽已经与明日香保持联系超过三年了。这三年来，她一直对我隐瞒这件事。她去探望明日香，与她共度时光，而在这期间，她一直维持着思念她、假装一无所知的假象。

I'm just… I'm so angry at her for it. She knows exactly how I feel about Asuka. She knows what Asuka means to me, she knows how upset I was when Asuka left and yet she could do something like this. Why Rei? Why did you do this? Why couldn't you tell me?  
我只是……我对她为此感到如此愤怒。她完全了解我对明日香的感情。她知道明日香对我意味着什么，她知道明日香离开时我有多难过，然而她却能做出这样的事。为什么，丽？你为什么要这么做？你为什么不能告诉我？

I try to search for an answer and one phrase pops into my head. Rei said it during our argument, _'She didn't want me to tell you…'_  
我试图寻找答案，脑海中浮现出一句话。丽在我们争吵时说过，‘她不希望我告诉你……’

Why? Why didn't she want you to tell me Rei and why did you agree to that? After all the lies that have hurt us in the past you thought it would be best to just agree to that even though you know it'd hurt me? Why didn't you speak to her? Why didn't you tell her you couldn't agree to that? You must have known it'd hurt me and you must have known the truth would come out eventually.  
为什么？为什么她不让你告诉我关于丽的事，而你又为何同意了？毕竟过去那些伤害我们的谎言，你认为最好还是同意，即使你知道这会伤害我？你为什么不和她谈谈？你为什么不告诉她你不能同意？你一定知道这会伤害我，你也一定知道真相迟早会浮出水面。

My mind now turns from Rei to Asuka herself, I can't really blame her for not wanting me to know about her. I know that in all likelihood I'm the reason for her leaving. I know just how much I hurt her before Third Impact, I violated her in her hospital room and then I left her to die against those damn Eva's. It was best she did get away from me.  
现在我的思绪从丽转向了明日香本人，我不能真的怪她不想让我知道她的事。我知道极有可能我是她离开的原因。我知道在第三次冲击之前我伤她有多深，我在她的病房里侵犯了她，然后我让她独自面对那些该死的 EVA 死去。她离开我是最好的选择。

Even when she came back, we both said that we were going to do more but then that changed. I made no effort to help her. I could see she was hurting, I could tell but I just couldn't bring myself to say or do anything. What right did I have to help her? How could someone like me have helped her? I know, I know I know I know how much of an idiot I am, I should have just spoken to her but I let her down. I don't blame her for leaving and hating me.  
即使她回来后，我们都说要做得更多，但后来这变了。我没有努力帮助她。我能看到她在痛苦，我能感觉到，但我就是无法让自己说或做任何事。我有什么权利帮助她？像我这样的人怎么能帮到她？我知道，我知道我知道我知道我是个多么愚蠢的人，我本该和她谈谈，但我让她失望了。我不怪她离开并恨我。

It's funny in a way but the night she left I had this strange dream. I dreamt that she had come into my room whilst I was asleep and she actually spoke to me. She said she loved me and wished me a happy Birthday. What a joke of a dream that was, as if Asuka would ever feel something like that for me. Still… When I woke up that morning she had left me a card and a gift, it made it seem like it was real.  
说来有些可笑，但就在她离开的那个晚上，我做了一个奇怪的梦。我梦见她趁我睡着时走进我的房间，还真的对我说话了。她说她爱我，祝我生日快乐。多么荒唐的梦啊，仿佛明日香会对我有这样的感情似的。不过……当我早上醒来时，她确实给我留下了一张卡片和一份礼物，这让我觉得那个梦像是真的。

I shake my head and feel those tears burning in the backs of my eyes again. There is no one here so I may as well let them fall. They silently trickle down my cheeks as I just sit and watch the city from afar. My anger has subsided now to just feeling completely rotten. I have a right to be angry, I know that but now I also feel sad and as I remember some of the things I said to Rei I also feel guilty. I suppose that just sums me up, doesn't it?  
我摇了摇头，感觉泪水又在眼眶后燃烧起来。这里没人，我干脆让它们流下来吧。泪水无声地滑过我的脸颊，我静静地坐着，远远地望着这座城市。我的怒气已经消退，现在只感到彻底的糟糕。我有权生气，我知道，但现在我也感到悲伤，回想起我对绫波说的一些话，我还感到内疚。我想，这大概就是我的全部，不是吗？

I sit for another minute and suddenly begin to feel my phone vibrate in my pocket. I wonder for a moment if I should just ignore it, the chances are it'll be Rei. I take the phone out and look at the screen to see a number I don't recognize. It's probably someone from the music group but I'm not really in a fit state to answer so I cancel the call and put the device back in my pocket. Whoever it is can wait.  
我又坐了一分钟，突然感觉到口袋里的手机在震动。我犹豫了一下是否应该无视它，很可能是丽打来的。我拿出手机，看到一个不认识的号码。可能是音乐组的人，但我现在状态不佳，不适合接听，于是我挂断了电话，把手机放回口袋。无论对方是谁，都得等等了。

**Kaworu's Apartment – Asuka Langley Soryu  
渚薰的公寓 —— 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I stare at my phone clenched tightly in my hand for a moment, completely dumbfounded and yet not entirely surprised by what has just happened. The idiot has declined my call, the goddamn idiot actually chose to cancel the damn call!  
我紧握着手机，愣愣地盯着它，一时间完全无语，但又不完全感到意外。那个白痴居然拒接了我的电话，该死的白痴竟然选择了挂断电话！

If I wasn't so angry at the situation I'd actually laugh because in all honesty I should have expected this to happen. I've spent years avoiding contact with him, I've spent so much time over the last few weeks agonizing over contacting him that I should have known this would happen. I should have known that when I finally make that leap there would be another obstacle! Of course there was going to be another one, this is exactly what being Asuka Langley Soryu is all about.  
如果不是对这情况如此愤怒，我其实会笑出来，因为说实话，我早该预料到会发生这种事。多年来我一直避免与他接触，过去几周我花了太多时间在是否联系他这件事上纠结，我早该知道会有这样的结果。我早该知道，当我终于鼓起勇气迈出那一步时，会有另一个障碍出现！当然会有另一个障碍，这正是成为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的全部意义所在。

No… This isn't what being me is about, I try to calm myself down and think about this logically. This isn't because of who I am at all. This is because of who Shinji is and because of what has happened to him today. It makes sense that he would decline any phone call after the bust up between him and Rei. The guy is probably upset and doesn't want to be bothered by anyone, I know I would be.  
不……这不是成为我自己的意义，我试图让自己冷静下来，理性地思考这件事。这根本不是因为我是什么样的人。这是因为真嗣是谁，以及他今天经历了什么。他和绫波之间发生争执后，拒绝接电话是有道理的。那家伙可能心情不好，不想被任何人打扰，我知道我也会这样。

Of course I'm not going to accept this, I made a promise to Rei that I would sort this out and if I have to sit here all night and keep calling him then I will. I don't care if it takes five or fifty phone calls, I will talk to Shinji tonight and I will sort out this damn situation.  
当然我不会接受这个结果，我向绫波承诺过会解决这个问题，如果我必须整晚坐在这里不停地给他打电话，那我就会这么做。我不在乎是打五次还是五十次，我今晚一定要和真嗣谈谈，并且解决这个该死的情况。

I've already added Shinji as a contact on my phone so I pull up his contact details again. I take another deep breath to steady myself and hit the call button. I suppose this little period of waiting gives me time to figure out just what it is I'll say to him, although I imagine I'll probably say nothing of what I have in my head.  
我已经把真嗣加为手机联系人了，于是再次调出他的联系方式。我深吸一口气，稳住心神，按下了通话键。我想这段等待的时间让我有机会琢磨该对他说些什么，尽管我猜实际说出口的恐怕不会是我脑海中的那些话。

There is a brief moment of silence and then the phone starts to ring. It rings once and then it rings a second time. We make it to three and then to four. We're further than we were before, maybe he's going to answer it this ti- Nope, line goes dead and I know he's cancelled the call. I didn't even get to his voice mail. Stupid… Idiot… Shinji!  
电话那头短暂地沉默了一瞬，随后开始响起铃声。响了一次，然后是第二次。我们等到了第三次，接着是第四次。比之前更进一步了，也许这次他会接电话——不，线路断了，我知道他挂掉了。我连他的语音信箱都没听到。真蠢……笨蛋……真嗣！

I bring the phone back down angrily and stare it at evaluating exactly what I should do next. First thing I have to do and I've already come up against an obstacle but what good am I if I can't overcome something like this?  
我气愤地将手机放下，盯着它，思索下一步该怎么做。第一步就遇到了障碍，但如果连这样的困难都无法克服，我还有什么用呢？

I know if I try calling him again then he'll probably just decline the call, I can't see him answering it willingly. He doesn't know who it is calling him, to him it could be anyone and the worst case for him would be Rei. He wants to be away from her right now. Worst case scenario is that he just blocks my number outright, if he does that then I do have a backup, I can just use another phone but it's that sort of behavior that will earn me a restraining order.  
我知道如果我再试着给他打电话，他很可能会直接拒接，我看不出他会愿意接听。他不知道是谁在打给他，对他来说可能是任何人，而最糟糕的情况就是丽。他现在想远离她。最坏的情况是他直接把我的号码拉黑，如果那样的话我还有备用方案，可以用另一部手机，但这种行为可能会让我收到限制令。

Shinji probably needs to know it's safe to answer the phone and therefore I have an idea. It's simple and might not work but it's worth a try. I'll message him and let him know it's me. I'll try to call him again and he'll answer. Simple but the question is, will he even check his messages? After two phonecalls he might have just put it on silence or just ignore it. I'm wasting time thinking about this, it's now or never Asuka.  
真嗣可能需要知道接电话是安全的，所以我有个主意。很简单，可能行不通，但值得一试。我会给他发消息，让他知道是我。我会再试着打给他，他会接的。简单，但问题是，他会查看消息吗？连续两次电话后，他可能已经把手机调成静音或者干脆不理会了。我在这上面浪费时间思考，现在就是要么成功要么放弃的时刻，明日香。

_'Idiot Shinji, answer your damn phone! We **need** to talk! Asuka.'  
'笨蛋真嗣，接你该死的电话！我们有话要谈！明日香。'_

I give him about half a minute or so to ensure the message reached him and he has a chance to read it. I grab the phone again and select his contact details and touch the call button. There is the brief moment of silence once more as we're connected and then the phone starts to ring.  
我给了他大约半分钟的时间，确保消息已经送达并让他有机会阅读。我再次拿起手机，选择他的联系信息，然后按下通话键。又一次，在我们接通的那一瞬间，是短暂的沉默，随后电话开始响起。

It rings the first time… then the second, it's about to ring a third time when I hear a clicking noise and a found from the other end. There is a pause and then the sound of a trembling and oh so recognizable voice. Instantly I feel my heart leap into my mouth, I feel my body start to shake, I feel sweat forming on my forehead.  
第一次响铃……然后是第二次，即将第三次响起时，我听到了一声咔嗒声和另一端的喘息。接着是一阵停顿，然后是那颤抖且无比熟悉的声音。我立刻感到心跳到了嗓子眼，身体开始颤抖，额头上冒出了汗珠。

_'I feel sick.' '我感觉恶心。'_

"H-Hello?" "H-你好？"

**Tokyo-2 Outskirts – Shinji Ikari  
东京-2 郊区 —— 碇真嗣**

As I put my phone back in my pocket I gaze out over the city once again. I look towards the side of the city where our apartment is. I can't make out the exact building from here but it's one of the quieter parts of the city only a short walk from the train station.  
我将手机放回口袋，再次凝视着这座城市。我望向我们公寓所在的那一侧。虽然从这里无法辨认出具体是哪栋建筑，但那是城市中较为宁静的区域，离火车站只有短短的步行距离。

I manage to find the train tracks and follow it a little bit of the way, after three stops I stop following it and look around that area. Around there the buildings are larger and closer together, there is a large park separating two of the larger apartment blocks and ahead of that is the building for our group. It's strange for me to think that a few hours ago I was in there and actually happy.  
我设法找到了铁轨，沿着它走了一段路，经过三个站点后我停了下来，环顾四周。那一带的建筑更大也更密集，一个大公园隔开了两座大型公寓楼，而前方就是我们的活动大楼。想到几个小时前我还在里面，甚至感到快乐，这让我觉得有些奇怪。

I feel my phone start to ring in my pocket. I pull the device out and see it's the same number as before. I'm sorry to whoever this is but I really don't feel like talking right now. Please try again later. I cancel the call hoping that this time they get the message and don't try again. If it is one of the people from the group I guess I'll have to come up with an excuse for being unable to answer.  
我感觉手机在口袋里响起。我拿出设备，看到是同一个号码。对不起，无论你是谁，我现在真的不想说话。请稍后再试。我挂断了电话，希望这次他们能明白我的意思，不要再打来。如果是团队里的人，我猜我得想个借口解释为什么没能接电话。

That can wait though, I put the phone back in my pocket and resume my gazing at the city. A cool breeze is starting to roll in now along with the setting sun. I'll probably have to leave here soon, the bus finishes serving this area in an hour and a half and it's a long walk back to the city. Still, I don't know where I'm going to go. I really don't want to go home but I also don't want to worry Misato.  
不过那可以稍后再说，我把手机放回口袋，继续凝视着这座城市。一阵凉风伴随着夕阳开始吹拂。我可能很快就得离开这里了，公交车一个半小时后就不再服务这个区域，步行回城可是一段漫长的路。尽管如此，我仍不知道该去哪里。我真的不想回家，但又不想让美里担心。

I guess I could go to Kensuke's and stay there for the night. He wouldn't mind and I don't think he'd ask too many questions either. I could tell Misato that I'm staying there tonight and she wouldn't worry about it. I wonder if Misato is even home yet, she's been working quite late for the past week or two. If she is home I wonder what Rei has told her, if Rei has told her anything at all.  
我想我可以去健介家过夜。他不会介意的，我也不认为他会问太多问题。我可以告诉美里我今晚住在健介家，她就不会为此担心了。我不知道美里是否已经回家，她过去一两周一直工作到很晚。如果她在家，我不知道丽是否告诉了她什么，或者丽是否告诉了她任何事情。

Rei might have lied about it and said I was out at a friend's. She might be playing innocent in front of Misato. Before today I'd never have suspected such a thing but with what I know now I can see it happening. A darker thought enters my mind, what if Misato knew about Asuka too? It's possible that the two of them were hiding it from me, after all Misato isn't one who likes being kept in the dark and she did try to find Asuka when she left.  
丽可能对此撒了谎，说我去了朋友家。她可能在美里面前装作无辜。在今天之前，我绝不会怀疑这种事，但根据我现在所知，我能看出这可能发生。一个更阴暗的想法闯入我的脑海，如果美里也知道明日香的事呢？有可能她们俩都在瞒着我，毕竟美里不喜欢被蒙在鼓里，而且她确实在明日香离开后试图寻找她。

No… I can't believe Misato would do that. She would have told me is Asuka is alright. She would have said something.  
不……我不相信美里会那样做。如果明日香没事，她会告诉我的。她会说些什么。

_'You mean like she told you about Kaworu?'  
'你是说她像告诉你关于薰的事那样？'_

No, that was different. She didn't have the opportunity and she spoke to me about him anyway.  
不，那不一样。她没有机会，但她还是向我提起了他。

_'After leaving it to Rei, she could have known about Asuka all along. She could even have helped Asuka leave and just pretended to look for her!'  
“把事情交给丽处理后，她可能一直都知道明日香的情况。她甚至可能帮助明日香离开，只是假装在寻找她！”_

No, that doesn't make sense. Rei wouldn't have helped her leave, they barely spoke to each other then. I just don't understand it, I don't understand why Rei would not tell me. I don't understand why Rei would lie like that when she knows what lies have done to us.  
不，这说不通。丽不会帮她离开的，她们那时几乎不说话。我就是不明白，我不明白为什么丽不告诉我。我不明白为什么丽明明知道谎言对我们造成了什么影响，还要那样撒谎。

God damnit Rei why… why would you do this? Why would you hurt me like this? Why would you betray me like this? I feel my hands clench themselves into a fist, my nails painfully dig into the palms of my hands but I don't mind. It's nothing compared to what I'm feeling inside.  
该死的丽，为什么……为什么要这么做？为什么要这样伤害我？为什么要这样背叛我？我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲痛苦地刺入手掌，但我不在乎。与内心的感受相比，这根本不算什么。

My phone vibrates in my pocket thankfully putting an end this train of though. It doesn't seem to be a phone call this time and I wonder if whoever it was before has gotten the message and gave up. Still I wonder if I should look at it, it's most likely from Rei or Misato telling me they're worried about me and want me to come home.  
幸运的是，我的手机在口袋里震动，打断了这连串的思绪。这次似乎不是电话，我猜之前的人是否已经收到信息放弃了。尽管如此，我还是犹豫是否该查看，很可能来自丽或美里，告诉我他们担心我，希望我回家。

I should probably ignore it. I should just let them worry about me but… I can't do that. I take my stupid phone out of my pocket and check the message. I see immediately it's from the person who has already tried calling me twice before.  
我或许应该忽略它。我应该让他们为我担心，但是……我做不到。我掏出那部愚蠢的手机查看信息。我立刻发现这是之前已经尝试打给我两次的人发来的。

I read the contents of the e-mail and as I do I feel my entire body freeze. My hand tightens around the phone and I begin to feel a knot in the pit of my stomach.  
我读着邮件的内容，随着每一行字，我感到整个身体都僵住了。我的手紧紧握住手机，胃里开始翻腾起一股不安的结。

_'Idiot Shinji, answer your damn phone! We **need** to talk! Asuka.'  
'笨蛋真嗣，接电话！我们有话要谈！明日香。'_

No… This… This isn't real, that can't be real. This has to be some sort of trick or prank but… why? Why would someone do this? Who would even do something like this? I just… know that that can't really be Asuka. Why would she contact me, after all this time why and how would she be contacting me?  
不……这……这不是真的，那不可能是真的。这一定是什么恶作剧或者骗局，但是……为什么？为什么会有人这么做？谁会做这样的事？我只是……知道那不可能是真的明日香。毕竟这么久了，她为什么要联系我，又是怎么联系上我的？

My hand starts to shake as suddenly the phone starts to ring again. It's the same number and I start to question whether I've really just ignored two phone calls from Asuka? Could it really be her? I don't know if I should ignore this one, what if it isn't and it's just some horrible trick to get me to answer but… what if it isn't?  
我的手开始颤抖，突然间电话再次响起。还是同一个号码，我开始怀疑自己是否真的忽略了来自明日香的两个电话？真的会是她吗？我不知道是否应该忽略这一次，万一不是她，只是某种可怕的恶作剧让我接听怎么办？但……万一真的是她呢？

I'm barely able to keep my hand still as I raise the phone up to my ear and accept the call. It takes me some time before I'm able to stutter out a feeble greeting, "H-Hello?"  
我几乎无法稳住自己的手，将手机举到耳边接听。过了好一会儿，我才结结巴巴地发出微弱的问候，“喂——喂？”

I'm greeted by silence and immediately begin to wonder if this really is just a stupid joke. A few more seconds roll by before I hear the sound of someone sighing, it's a woman and my heart begins to pound faster in my chest. A moment later she finally speaks, she sounds barely any different than she did four and a half years ago, _"Hello Shinji."_  
迎接我的是沉默，我立刻开始怀疑这会不会只是一个愚蠢的玩笑。几秒钟过去，我听到了一声叹息，是个女人的声音，我的心开始在胸腔里加速跳动。片刻之后，她终于开口了，听起来和四年前半几乎没有什么变化，“你好，真嗣。”

"A-Asuka!" I speak her name unsure as to what I should be feeling right now. A part of me still can't quite believe it, so I ask for confirmation, "Is… Is it really you?"  
“-明日香！” 我叫出她的名字，不确定此刻该有什么感觉。我的一部分仍然难以置信，于是我寻求确认，“是……真的是你吗？”

I hear what sounds like a faint laugh, _"Yes Shinji… It's really me. Can we talk?"_  
我听到像是轻笑的声音，“是的，真嗣……真的是我。我们可以谈谈吗？”

My entire body breaks out in a cold sweat at that confirmation and my mouth goes completely dry. I open it to speak but no words come out so instead I feebly nod at her question. A motion I soon realize is completely stupid given that she can't see me. I open my mouth again to reply but I'm still unable to speak. There are too many things racing through my mind right now, I can feel my chest tightening as I struggle to filter any of it out.  
听到这个确认，我全身冒出冷汗，嘴巴干得说不出话。我张开嘴想说话，却发不出声音，只好无力地点头回应她的问题。我很快意识到这个动作完全愚蠢，因为她看不见我。我再次张嘴回答，但还是说不出话。此刻脑海中有太多事情在奔涌，我感到胸口发紧，努力想理清思绪。

I can't figure out what to say to her or what I should be thinking. I don't know if I should be happy or sad about this. I don't know if I should be afraid or angry. I don't know if I should start asking her how she is or why she left. I don't know if I should ask her what she has been doing or if I should talk about myself. I don't know if I should ask her if she knows about Rei or anything. I… I need to stop, I need to calm down. Too many thoughts… Too many thoughts… I can't think…  
我搞不懂该对她说些什么，或者我应该怎么想。我不知道我该为此感到高兴还是悲伤。我不知道我该害怕还是生气。我不知道我是否该开始问她过得怎么样，或者她为什么离开。我不知道我是否该问她一直在做什么，还是该谈谈我自己。我不知道我是否该问她是否知道关于丽的事情。我……我需要停下来，我需要冷静。太多的思绪……太多的思绪……我无法思考……

I take a deep breath and try to just focus on Asuka's question for now. Can I talk, not exactly but I can listen. I try to filter out everything else and just focus on replying to her, eventually I manage to mumble out a confirmation, "Yes…"  
我深吸一口气，试图暂时只专注于明日香的问题。我能说话吗，不完全是，但我可以倾听。我尽量过滤掉其他一切，只专注于回答她，最终我勉强咕哝出一个确认，“是的……”

There is another faint laugh from her, _"Heh, still not much with words eh? Well don't worry about that. I don't expect you to say much… if anything at all. After what I've got to say I don't really expect you to ever want to speak to me again but I ask that you at least listen to what I have to say."_  
她又轻轻笑了一声，“嘿，还是不善言辞吗？好吧，别担心这个。我不指望你多说什么……甚至什么都不说。在我要说的事情之后，我不指望你还会想再和我说话，但我请求你至少听我说完。”

"O-Okay…" I take in her words and continue trying to calm myself down. Asuka doesn't expect me to say anything, that's good because right now I can't think of what to say. I can listen for now.  
"好…好的…" 我消化着她的话，继续努力让自己平静下来。明日香并没有期待我回应什么，这很好，因为此刻我实在想不出该说什么。现在我只能倾听。

_"First of all… I should probably start by saying I'm sorry."_ She pauses for a moment, _"I'm sorry I left you guys the way I did, I'm sorry it took me so damn long to get in contact and I'm sorry about what has happened between you and Rei."_  
"首先…我应该先道歉。" 她停顿了一下，"对不起，我那样离开你们，对不起我花了这么久才联系上，也对不起你和丽之间发生的事。"

I was starting to slowly calm down but hearing her say Rei's name sends a pang of panic through me, "You know about that?"  
我正慢慢平静下来，但听到她提起丽的名字，一阵恐慌突然袭来，"你知道那件事？"

_"Yes I do."_ Asuka's tone darkens as she speaks, _"She called me shortly after you left her. She told me about what had happened and about what you said to her."_  
"是的，我确实知道。" 明日香的声音在她说话时变得阴沉，"你离开她后不久，她就给我打了电话。她告诉我发生了什么事，还有你对她说的话。"

"O-Oh…" I glance down at the ground shamefully knowing that one of the first things Asuka is mentioning to me after all this time is that argument with Rei, "So… it is true then, you and her have been in contact with each other for… all that time?"  
"哦……" 我羞愧地低头看着地面，知道明日香在这么长时间后跟我提起的第一件事就是和绫的那场争吵，"那么……这是真的了，你和她一直保持着联系……这么长时间？"

_"Yes, it's true Shinji." "是的，这是真的，真嗣。"_

"How?" “怎么？”

_"About a year after I returned to Germany she turned up. She had managed to track me down and she intended to bring me back to you guys." Asuka laughs, "She was so… unlike the Rei I had known. She had grown and she was determined to do it but… I stopped her. I wasn't ready to go back and I had a breakdown. I don't really want to talk about it but she was there for me and said she would help me."  
“大约在我回到德国一年后，她出现了。她设法找到了我，并打算带我回到你们身边。”明日香笑着说，“她变得……和我认识的绫波完全不同。她成长了，决心这么做，但是……我阻止了她。我还没准备好回去，我崩溃了。我真的不想谈这个，但她在我身边，说她会帮我。”_

Asuka… broke down in front of Rei? If it wasn't Asuka telling me this I wouldn't be able to believe such a thing had happened. She never really got along with Rei, before Third Impact it seemed like she hated Rei and after it they barely spoke. I know Rei always wanted to talk to Asuka, to try and be her friend and even missed her but this is not what I imagined.  
明日香……在绫波面前崩溃了？如果不是明日香亲口告诉我，我简直无法相信这种事会发生。她以前和绫波一直相处不好，在第三次冲击之前，她似乎讨厌绫波，冲击之后她们几乎没怎么说过话。我知道绫波一直想和明日香交流，试图成为她的朋友，甚至想念她，但这完全出乎我的意料。

_"I needed a friend Shinji, I had been alone in Germany for a year and I was miserable and Rei… was that friend I needed. I asked for something in return though, I asked that in exchange for friendship she not reveal she had met me to you or anyone else… at least not yet. I wasn't ready to come back or have anyone else there."  
"我需要一个朋友，真嗣，我在德国独自一人已经一年了，我过得很痛苦，而绫波……就是我需要的那位朋友。不过，我也提出了一个条件，我要求她作为友谊的交换，不要向你或其他任何人透露她见过我……至少现在不要。我还没准备好回来，也不想让那里的任何人知道。"_

I almost start to protest as I process Asuka's words. I almost suggest that maybe Rei could have persuaded her or done something else. I almost ask why it took so long and why Rei was comfortable lying to me for all that time.  
听到明日香的话，我几乎要反驳了。我几乎想提议，也许绫波能说服她或做些什么别的。我几乎想问为什么花了这么长时间，为什么绫波能心安理得地对我撒谎这么久。

_"I understand you're mad at Rei but if you want to be mad at someone then you should be mad at me. I'm the one who left you guys, I'm the one who isolated myself and I'm the one who asked her to keep it all secret."  
"我明白你对绫波很生气，但如果你想对某人生气，那就应该对我生气。是我离开了你们，是我孤立了自己，也是我要求她保守这一切秘密的。"_

I can feel my anger starting to subside on hearing her words and they're replaced with a rotten feeling. Still I have to know more, Rei still went along with this lie and didn't say anything, I know she didn't want to betray Asuka but was it really that easy for her?  
听到她的话，我能感觉到怒气开始消退，取而代之的是一种腐烂的感觉。尽管如此，我还是想知道更多，丽仍然顺从这个谎言，什么也没说，我知道她不想背叛明日香，但对她来说真的那么容易吗？

"Did Rei really… agree to it?"  
“丽真的……同意了吗？”

I hear another laugh, _"No… Not at first anyway. She wanted to take me back to you guys and thought it'd help me and tried to get me to think of another option but I was stubborn. I said it'd only be for a little while until… I was ready I guess but that time never came. She would ask a lot and try to get me to do something but I never would."_  
我又听到一声笑声，“不……一开始并没有。她想带我回到你们那里，认为这会对我有帮助，并试图让我考虑其他选择，但我很固执。我说这只是暂时的，直到……我准备好为止，但那一天从未到来。她会经常问，并试图让我做些什么，但我从未答应。”

"I see…" "我明白了…"

_"You know… a part of me always wondered if she had secretly told you or Misato about it and you guys were just waiting for me to come back. I guess today confirms she did keep it all a secret."  
"你知道…我总有一部分在想，她是不是已经偷偷告诉了你或美里，而你们只是在等我回来。看来今天证实了，她确实一直保守着这个秘密。"_

"Y-Yeah… I didn't know anything." I confirm.  
"嗯-嗯…我什么也不知道。" 我确认道。

_"I'm sorry Shinji… I know you hate being lied to and I know this is a pretty big one but please… if you're going to be mad at someone then be mad at me."  
"对不起，真嗣……我知道你讨厌被欺骗，也知道这是一个相当大的谎言，但请……如果你要生谁的气，那就生我的气吧。"_

I shake my head as I continue trying to process this entire situation. I don't know if I'll be able to tonight or even in a week but the more Asuka speaks the more guilt starts to creep in about the argument with Rei.  
我摇着头，继续努力理解这一切。我不知道今晚甚至一周内能否做到，但随着明日香继续说话，我对与绫波争吵的愧疚感逐渐加深。

"I… I said something horrible to Rei." I suddenly say.  
"我……我对绫波说了些很过分的话。" 我突然说道。

_"I know you did." "我知道你做了。"_

"I… I don't know what to do." I feel tears burning in my eyes, "I didn't… I had no idea about any of this and you… I didn't know and I said… I said she was like our father!"  
"我…我不知道该怎么办。" 我感觉泪水在眼眶中燃烧，"我之前…我对这一切一无所知，而你…我不知道，我还说…我还说她像我们的父亲！"

_"Yes… She told me."_ I can hear the anger in Asuka's voice as she speaks, _"You have to do what you're good at Shinji, apologize."_  
"是的…她告诉我了。" 我能听出明日香声音中的愤怒，"你得做你擅长的事，真嗣，道歉。"

"No… No I can't… I can't do that, she won't forgive me… I went too far."  
“不…不，我做不到…我不能那样做，她不会原谅我的…我做得太过分了。”

_"Idiot!"_ She cuts me off, _"Rei wants her brother home and safe, she was hurt by what you said but she is more worried about you. She's worried you'll do something stupid and get hurt!"_  
“笨蛋！”她打断我，“零希望她哥哥平安回家，她被你的话伤到了，但她更担心你。她怕你会做出什么傻事，然后受伤！”

I try to calm my breathing, "Yeah… You're right… I… I just can't yet. I need a bit more time."  
我试图平复呼吸，“是啊…你说得对…我…我还做不到。我需要多一点时间。”

_"Well try to not take as long as I have."_ Asuka laughs, her comment drawing a smile from me as well, _"Are you mad at me Shinji?"_  
"我会尽量不拖那么久的。" 明日香笑着说，她的话也让我不由得微笑起来，"真嗣，你生我的气了吗？"

"I… I don't know Asuka, I… I still don't really understand a few things. I don't understand why you left." I pause for a moment, "It was so sudden, I thought… I thought I had some something wrong, or there was something wrong with you. I know I hurt you Asuka and I know I could have done more but…"  
"我……我不知道，明日香，我……我还是不太明白一些事情。我不明白你为什么要离开。" 我停顿了一下，"太突然了，我以为……我以为我做错了什么，或者你有什么问题。我知道我伤害了你，明日香，我知道我本可以做得更多，但是……"

_"Oh Shinji, you idiot!"_ She cuts me off again, _"It was nothing to do with you or anyone else there. It was me, it was just something I had to do. When I was there with you guys all I could think about was how awful I was, all I could think about was that horrible bratty girl from before Third Impact. All the things she had said or done to you all and I was frightened of being her again."_  
"哦，真嗣，你这个笨蛋！" 她再次打断了我，"这与你或那里的任何人无关。是我自己的问题，我只是必须去做这件事。当我和你们在一起时，我满脑子想的都是我有多糟糕，满脑子都是那个在第三次冲击前的讨厌鬼。她对你们说过的所有话，做过的所有事，我害怕再次变成她。"

"A-Asuka…" I trail off and give her the chance to say more.  
"A-明日香…" 我停顿下来，给她机会继续说下去。

_"When I looked at the three of you… It was like looking at a family, you had your sister and your mother with Rei and Misato and me… I didn't belong in that group. I didn't deserve to be a part of that group…"  
"当我看着你们三个… 就像看着一个家庭，你有你的姐姐和妈妈，丽和美里还有我… 我不属于那个团体。我不配成为那个团体的一部分…"_

"Asuka you…" My voice almost cracks but I manage to keep it in check, "I don't understand, you… You did belong with us. We all cared for you and we all knew why you did the things you did. We all forgave you just like we forgave each other. When we returned it was supposed to be a fresh start! You weren't that person anymore"  
"明日香，你…" 我的声音几乎要破裂，但我设法控制住了，"我不明白，你… 你确实属于我们。我们都关心你，我们都知道你为什么做那些事。我们都原谅了你，就像我们互相原谅一样。当我们回来时，本应是一个全新的开始！你不再是那个人了"

_"I know! I know that! Rei has already told me enough times!"_ I can hear the frustration in her voice when she speaks, _"But you know it isn't that easy don't you? She is there all the time, reminding me of every horrible thing I have said or done. It's always there when I sleep and I can't shake it. I know I'm not that person but… That doesn't seem to help! You understand, don't you?"_  
"我知道！我知道这个！丽已经跟我说过很多次了！" 我能听出她声音中的沮丧，"但你知道这并不容易，对吧？她总是在那里，提醒我说的每一句伤人的话或做的每一件错事。每次我睡觉时它都在，我无法摆脱。我知道我不是那样的人，但是……这似乎并没有帮助！你明白的，对吧？"

"Yeah… I do…" I sigh, "Each and every day I'm reminded of the mistakes I made before Third Impact and the things I did during it. I remember all the times I hurt people and feel like I don't serve to be here. I feel like at any moment someone will recognize me for what I really am and I'll get what I deserve."  
"嗯……我明白……" 我叹了口气，"每一天，我都被之前第三次冲击时犯的错误和在那期间做的事情所提醒。我记得所有伤害人的时刻，感觉自己不配在这里。我总觉得随时会有人认出我的真面目，然后我会得到应有的报应。"

_"I hurt you guys so much so… I thought the best thing would be to remove myself so you three could be happy."  
"我伤害了你们这么多……所以我想最好的办法就是离开，这样你们三个才能幸福。"_

"Did you ever plan on coming back?"  
"你有没有打算回来？"

_"Eventually I guess but… I just never felt like I was ready to. The longer I was away the less I felt I'd be able to come back. Like I said, Rei kept on trying to push me to come back. She's always tell me things about you and Misato to try to encourage me to get in contact."  
"我想最终会的，但……我只是从未觉得自己准备好了。离开得越久，我就越觉得无法回来。就像我说的，丽一直在试图推动我回来。她总是告诉我你和美里的事情，试图鼓励我联系你们。"_

"Rei… told you about us?" I ask in surprise.  
""丽……告诉了你关于我们的事？"" 我惊讶地问。

_"Of course she did you idiot!"_ Asuka barks back at me, _"Rei was so proud of you! She always spoke about you and I was happy to listen, I wanted to know things about you and Misato and the others. I wanted to know you were all okay and it seemed like you were and in a way that… it just confirmed that I was right, you were all happier without me."_  
"她当然会这么做，你这个白痴！" 明日香对我吼道，"丽对你感到非常骄傲！她总是提起你，我很高兴听她讲，我想了解你和美里还有其他人的事情。我想知道你们都还好，而你们似乎确实都很好，这让我觉得……我当初的决定是对的，没有我，你们都更快乐。"

"But we all missed you! Misato, Hikari and even Touji and Kensuke did!"  
"但我们都很想念你！美里、光还有甚至连真治和健介也是！"

_"The fact that the stooges missed me doesn't exactly fill me with joy."_ She lets out a laugh, _"But I appreciate the effort. Rei… told me that you've started playing the cello again?"_  
"那两个笨蛋想念我，可不会让我感到高兴。" 她笑出声来，"不过我还是很感激你的努力。丽……告诉我你又开始拉大提琴了？"

I smile, "Yeah! Misato suggested I… start taking lessons again so I got a teacher and he… he said he had a group of people who played various string instruments and wanted to put together an ensemble. I… agreed to it."  
我微笑着说：“是的！美里建议我……重新开始上课，所以我找了个老师，他……他说他有一群会演奏各种弦乐器的人，想组建一个合奏团。我……同意了。”

_"Are you enjoying it?"_ She asks me.  
“你喜欢吗？”她问我。

"Yeah, I am… I, I really like playing and the people are really nice as well. I've only had two meetings with them but it's been fun."  
“嗯，我喜欢……我，我真的喜欢演奏，而且大家也都非常友好。我只和他们见过两次，但感觉很有趣。”

_"Good! I'm glad to hear you're doing something with the cello again. It always irritated me the way you put yourself down about it, you were very good when I heard you all those years ago."  
"太好了！很高兴听到你又开始拉大提琴了。你总是贬低自己，这让我很恼火，多年前我听过你拉琴，真的很棒。"_

"You really thought I was good?" I ask in surprise.  
"你真的觉得我拉得好吗？" 我惊讶地问。"

_"Yes I did!"_ Asuka pauses for a moment, _"You have talent Shinji and I'm glad you're actually doing something with it. In fact… I'd like to hear what you can do some time."_  
"是的，我觉得你很棒！" 明日香顿了一下，"你有天赋，真嗣，我很高兴你真的在用它做些什么。实际上……我想找个时间听听你的演奏。"

"Really?" I jump to my feet in surprise, "You... You'd really like to hear me play?"  
"真的吗？" 我惊讶地跳了起来，"你... 你真的想听我演奏？"

_"Yes, record something and send it over to me. I'll send you my e-mail address when we're done here. Rei also mentioned something about a concert?"  
"是的，录点什么发给我吧。我们结束后我会把我的电子邮件地址发给你。丽还提到了什么音乐会？"_

"Oh... Yeah... My ensemble... the guy in charge wanted us to put on a concert in December."  
"哦... 是的... 我的乐团... 负责的那个人想让我们在十二月举办一场音乐会。"

_"That's great!"_ She replies and I'm surprised by the enthusiasm in her voice, _"What will you be playing?"_  
"太好了！" 她回答道，我惊讶于她声音中的热情，"你会演奏什么呢？"

"Um... Well a mixture of things really, he wanted to try and do some sort of music through the ages so... He's selected some classical stuff through to more modern stuff. I... I don't really know much of the stuff outside of the classical material like... I've heard of a few of the bands but I don't really know them or the music... I was going to listen to them tonight but then this happened."  
"嗯... 其实是一系列的东西，他想尝试做一些跨越时代的音乐... 所以他选了一些从古典到现代的曲目。我... 我对古典之外的东西了解不多，比如... 我听说过一些乐队，但并不真正了解他们或他们的音乐... 我本来打算今晚听听的，但后来就发生了这件事。"

Asuka simply laughs, _"Sounds interesting. What bands did he have listed?_  
明日香只是笑了笑，"听起来挺有意思的。他列了哪些乐队？

"Oh..." I pull the music player out of my pocket and for a moment I just stare at it blankly. This was a gift... A gift from Asuka before she left, I never got a chance to thank her. I should do that now, "Asuka I... The music player you got me before you left I just... Wanted to say thank you."  
"哦..." 我从口袋里掏出音乐播放器，一时间只是茫然地盯着它。这是件礼物...是明日香离开前送给我的，我从未有机会向她道谢。现在我应该这么做，"明日香，我...你离开前送给我的音乐播放器，我只想说声谢谢。"

_"You liked it?"_ She asks me, _"I know you used to use your old SDAT a lot so I thought it'd be a good present. Do you still have it?"_  
"你喜欢它吗？" 她问我，"我知道你以前经常用你的旧 SDAT，所以我想这会是个不错的礼物。你还留着它吗？"

"Yeah, I... I use it every day actually. Thank you."  
"嗯，我...我其实每天都用它。谢谢你。"

_"Don't mention it, so these bands he mentioned?"  
"别提了，他提到的那些乐队呢？"_

I head to the playlist and scroll past the more familiar material. I expect Asuka will probably be more interested in the sixties and onwards, "Well... The Beatles are on it."  
我打开播放列表，略过那些较为熟悉的曲目。我猜想明日香可能会对六十年代及以后的音乐更感兴趣，“嗯... 披头士乐队也在里面。”

_"Well of course they are, would be impossible to do a music through the ages without them. I'm sure even you know who they are though."  
“当然有他们，要做一个跨越时代的音乐列表，没有他们是不可能的。不过我确信，即使是你也知道他们是谁。”_

"Yeah... I know a few songs." I scroll down, "There are a few I don't know, Genesis... Pink Floyd... Queen... Procol Harum and... there is a guy here called... Meat Loaf? Who calls themselves Meat Loaf?"  
"是啊...我会几首歌。" 我往下翻，"有些我不太熟，创世纪乐队...平克·弗洛伊德...皇后乐队...普洛柯哈伦乐队，还有...这里有个叫...肉块？谁会自称肉块啊？""

My comment draws another laugh from her, _"Look at a picture of the guy and you'll understand!"_  
我的评论又逗得她笑了起来，"看看那家伙的照片你就明白了！"

"You know who that is?"  
"你知道那是谁吗？""

_"I was raised in Europe, of course I know who Meat Loaf is! I have to say those are some good choices, will go well in a string ensemble I think, in fact a couple of them have already played with orchestras and have symphonic tributes."  
"我从小在欧洲长大，当然知道谁是 Meat Loaf！不得不说这些选择都很不错，我觉得用在弦乐合奏中会很合适，实际上其中几首已经与管弦乐队合作过，还有交响乐致敬版。"_

"Really? I had no idea!" I reply.  
"真的吗？我完全不知道！" 我回答道。"

_"Of course you didn't! Tell you what I'll have a look through my collection tomorrow and see what I can find, if you send me the exact tracks your teacher is thinking of I'll try to send you the versions of the songs that have been done by or with an orchestra to help you out."  
"你当然不知道！这样吧，我明天翻翻我的收藏，看看能找到什么。如果你把老师考虑的具体曲目发给我，我会尽量发给你那些由管弦乐队演奏或合作的版本，帮你一把。"_

"You... You would do that? That... That'd be really helpful Asuka." I feel myself smile as I speak to her, "T-Thank you."  
"你... 你会这么做吗？那... 那会真的很有帮助，明日香。" 我感到自己在对她说话时露出了微笑，"谢... 谢谢你。"

_"Don't mention it just... consider it part of the apology from me okay."  
"不用谢，就... 把它当作我道歉的一部分，好吗？"_

"I... Okay..." I pause for a moment, "What about you Asuka, what are you doing now?"  
"我... 好吧..." 我停顿了一下，"你呢，明日香，你现在在做什么？"

_"Me... Not much I... Um..."_ Asuka trails off for a moment and lets out another sigh, _"I guess it's only fair you know too then, I'm a writer."_  
"我...没什么，我...嗯..."" 明日香顿了顿，又叹了口气，""我想，让你知道也是公平的，我是个作家。"

"Really? You... You're a writer?"  
"真的吗？你...你是个作家？"

_"Well don't sound too surprised! I can be creative too, I've even had my work published!"  
"哎，别那么惊讶！我也有创造力，我的作品甚至出版过呢！"_

I look at the phone in confusion, "What did you write?"  
我困惑地看着手机，“你写了什么？”

_"Zero."  “零。”_

I can hear the pride in her voice as she says it but it only adds to my confusion. I'm familiar with the book, Rei loves it, she has a signed copy of it and Kensuke is a big fan too but the author isn't Asuka it's someone called Mari Makinami.  
我能听出她语气中的自豪，但这只是加深了我的困惑。我对这本书很熟悉，丽喜欢它，她有一本签名版，而真希也同样是它的忠实粉丝，但作者不是明日香，而是叫作真希波·真理的人。

"But... That's wrote by-"  
"但...那是谁写的-"

_"Are you stupid?"_ Asuka asks me bluntly, _"That's a psuedonym Shinji, Mari Makinami doesn't exist. It's me, I'm the author. Look at the book, the main character is based on Rei!"_  
"你傻吗？" 明日香直截了当地问我，"那是笔名，真嗣，真希波·真理并不存在。作者是我，书中的主角是以绫波为原型的！"

"Oh! Why though... Why did you write under a fake name?"  
"哦！那为什么...为什么要用假名写作？"

She sighs, _"I wouldn't have done a very good job of hiding myself from the world if I published a best-selling book under my real name would I?"_  
她叹了口气，“如果我用真名出版了一本畅销书，那我隐藏自己的工作肯定做得不怎么样，对吧？”

I laugh, "Oh yeah... I guess not. Rei... Rei is a huge fan of that book and Kensuke loves it as well. I... I never read it though..."  
我笑道，“哦，是啊...我想也是。丽...丽是那本书的超级粉丝，健介也很喜欢。我...我倒是没读过...”

_"Then you better go and do it."  
“那你最好去读一读。”_

"I will... Does... Rei know?"  
“我会……绫波……知道吗？”

_"Of course she does, Kensuke is not to know though at all. Even when I visit he is not to know about it, I'm not having that crazed fanboy bother me."  
“她当然知道，不过绝对不能让真希波知道。即使我去拜访，也不能让他知道，我可不想被那个疯狂的粉丝打扰。”_

We both laugh and then Asuka speaks again, her tone a bit more serious this time, _"I want you to do something Shinji."_  
我们俩都笑了，随后明日香再次开口，这次她的语气稍微严肃了一些，“我有件事想让你做，真嗣。”

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

_"Go home... Go home and talk to your sister. Apologize to her for what you said and make things up with her."  
“回家吧...回家和你妹妹谈谈。为你的话向她道歉，和她和好。”_

"O-Okay..." “好...好的...”

_"I'm going to message her too but I want the two of you to talk to Misato and tell her everything as well. Make sure you defend Rei during it, make sure that Misato knows everything was my fault and it was all my decision. Tell her if she wants to talk to me or yell at me she can call me."  
"我也会给她发消息，但我想让你们俩和美里谈谈，告诉她一切。确保你们在过程中维护丽，让美里知道一切都是我的错，都是我的决定。告诉她如果她想和我谈话或对我发火，可以给我打电话。"_

"Right... I can do that."  
"好的...我能做到。"

_"Good, then go and do it."_ She pauses, _"Again... I am sorry I took so long but it's happened now. Here I am... In Germany and you know how to contact me. We'll talk again soon alright?"_  
"很好，那就去做吧。"她停顿了一下，"再次...我很抱歉花了这么长时间，但事情已经发生了。我现在在德国，你知道怎么联系我。我们很快会再谈的，好吗？"

"Yeah... We will, thank you." I smile calmly as I slowly start to walk away from my position and back towards the bus stop.  
“是的……我们会去的，谢谢。”我平静地微笑着，缓缓从原位走开，朝公交车站走去。

_"Also... Your concert in December... I want you to make sure you put aside two tickets for me and a friend. We... We'll be coming to it."  
“还有……你十二月的演唱会……我要你确保给我和一位朋友留两张票。我们……我们会去参加的。”_

"A friend?" “一位朋友？”

_"That's not important now Shinji, just do it. I still have a few other things to tell you but it's late and it can wait."  
“现在不重要了，真嗣，快去做吧。我还有几件事要告诉你，但时间不早了，可以等明天再说。”_

I don't want to say goodbye, I want to stay and talk to her all night. I want to speak to her about everything has happened to her since she left. I want to tell her about my life, not that I have much to tell her. She is right though, I should go home. I should apologize to Rei and talk to her and Misato about this.  
我不想说再见，我想留下来和她彻夜长谈。我想和她聊聊她离开后发生的所有事情。我想告诉她我的生活，虽然也没什么好说的。不过她是对的，我应该回家。我应该向绫道歉，并和绫以及美里谈谈这件事。

I'm still not quite sure how to feel about all of this. I'm so happy that I now know she is okay. At the same time I still feel bad about this whole situation, I still feel like I'm somewhat to blame for her leaving. I still feel that she didn't want me to know about her because of who I am. I can still feel some anger at her and Rei for the lie.  
我仍然不太确定该如何看待这一切。我很高兴现在知道她安然无恙。与此同时，我仍然为整个情况感到难过，我仍然觉得自己对她离开负有一定责任。我仍然觉得她不想让我知道她的存在是因为我是谁。我仍然对她和绫的谎言感到愤怒。

I don't expect this to be resolved in an evening though. This will take time and at least we have a place to start from. I prepare myself to say goodbye to Asuka but I'm glad this won't be the last time I say it.  
虽然我不指望这件事一晚上就能解决。这需要时间，至少我们有了一个起点。我准备好向明日香告别，但庆幸这不会是我最后一次说再见。

"Okay... Goodbye Asuka." “好吧...再见，明日香。”

_"Goodbye Shinji, I'll talk to you soon."  
“再见，真嗣，我们很快会再聊的。”_

**Berlin Streets - Kaworu Nagisa  
柏林街头 - 渚薰**

As I feel the cold wind brush against my skin I so wish I had brought my jacket with me. I was in such a rush to leave I went out in my t-shirt and didn't realize how cold it would be. Still I suppose it does give me something else to focus on other than the unease that I have been feeling since Asuka said she would make that phone call.  
当寒风拂过我的肌肤，我多么希望自己带了外套。我走得如此匆忙，只穿了件 T 恤就出门了，没想到会这么冷。不过，我想这也让我有了别的东西可以集中注意力，而不是一直想着自从明日香说要打那个电话后我感到的不安。

Asuka… She will be talking to Shinji right now. This will be their first conversation in other four years and I am so… happy that such an event has occurred. I know that the two of them have shared and faced so much pain, I know all about the fragility of their hearts and it saddened me to know that they were no longer in contact.  
明日香……她现在应该在和真嗣通话。这是他们四年来的第一次对话，我感到非常……高兴，这样的事情终于发生了。我知道他们俩共同经历了那么多痛苦，我了解他们心灵的脆弱，得知他们不再联系让我感到悲伤。

Yet despite all of this I feel something else, fear. I fear what this turn of events means for me. I fear that I no longer know where I stand in this place. Deep down I always knew that this day would come, it is… I suppose you could call it destiny. I just wasn't expecting it to happen so soon and so suddenly. Especially not after I had experienced such a wondrous event the other day.  
然而尽管如此，我仍感到另一种情绪——恐惧。我害怕这一系列变故对我意味着什么。我害怕我已不再清楚自己在这地方的位置。内心深处，我始终知道这一天终将到来，这或许是……我想你可以称之为命运。我只是没料到它会来得如此之快，如此突然。尤其是在我前几天经历了那样一场奇妙的事件之后。

Still, I suppose it is probably better that this happens sooner rather than later. I suppose it is better that it happens before this thing, I suppose you would call it a romance, develops further between myself and Asuka. If it happened later then it would perhaps be harder for me to accept and move on.  
尽管如此，我想这或许早发生比晚发生要好。我想在‘这件事’，你或许会称之为恋情，在我和明日香之间进一步发展之前发生是更好的。如果晚些时候发生，也许我会更难以接受并继续前行。

I am so happy for the two of them. They both deserve to find true happiness and I know that it doesn't in any way negate my chances of finding happiness. I just feel… I feel that Asuka was really special, she understood me and I felt that in some ways I understood her as well. Asuka has such a fierce personality but it is tinged with a softness and gentleness.  
我为他们俩感到非常高兴。他们都值得找到真正的幸福，我知道这并不以任何方式否定我找到幸福的机会。我只是觉得……我觉得明日香真的很特别，她理解我，而在某种程度上我也理解她。明日香有着如此强烈的个性，却又带着一丝温柔和细腻。

When I held her or she held me I felt a wonderful sensation skin to floating. When I was around Asuka I felt so very safe. She was oh so beautiful as well, each and every part of her and she had an infectious smile that never failed to brighten up my day.  
当我抱着她或她抱着我时，我感到一种奇妙的漂浮感。在明日香身边，我感到无比安全。她非常美丽，每一个部分都如此，她那具有感染力的笑容总能照亮我的日子。

So I, Kaworu Nagisa, am happy. I am really really happy. I want nothing more than for those two souls that have been hurt so much to find true happiness. So, despite the fact that I have this awful knot in my stomach and tears welling up in the corners of my eyes I… I am happy.  
所以，我，渚薰，感到幸福。我真的非常幸福。我只希望那两个受过如此多伤害的灵魂能找到真正的幸福。所以，尽管我心中有这糟糕的纠结感，眼角涌出泪水，我……我依然感到幸福。

I continue to walk through the streets, this is a route very familiar to me. It is one that I've walked a vast number of times over the last few months. I've not walked it in the last few weeks, since the attack I ended up relegating myself to my apartment except for going out to work or for shopping. I felt that getting out this time was necessary, Asuka and Shinji needed time alone to talk.  
我继续走在这些街道上，这条路线对我来说非常熟悉。在过去几个月里，我走过无数次。自从那次袭击后，我已经有几周没有走过这条路了，除了上班或购物，我一直待在公寓里。我觉得这次出门是必要的，明日香和真嗣需要独处的时间来交谈。

I cross the road onto another street, this one isn't quite as empty as the others. There are a few people stood chatting outside of a café. I move part them and I know it's just my imagination and current mood but I'm sure I can hear them all stop talking. I'm sure I can feel their eyes on me. I do this a lot, I always wonder if people are staring at me, I stand out so why wouldn't they?  
我穿过马路，来到另一条街道，这条街不像其他地方那么空旷。有几个人站在咖啡馆外聊天。我穿过他们，我知道这只是我的想象和当前情绪作祟，但我确信我能听到他们全都停止了交谈。我确信我能感觉到他们的目光落在我身上。我经常这样想，我总是怀疑人们是否在盯着我看，我如此显眼，他们怎么会不注意呢？

I pick up speed and move around the corner to an emptier street and my mind turns back to Asuka and Shinji. I wonder what they've spoken about. I wonder if she mentioned me. I wonder when she'll be going back. I feel the tears threaten again.  
我加快脚步，绕过拐角来到一条更空旷的街道，思绪又回到了明日香和真嗣身上。我想知道他们谈了些什么。我想知道她是否提到了我。我想知道她什么时候会回去。泪水再次涌上眼眶。

I get halfway down this street when I feel my phone suddenly start to vibrate in my pocket. I immediately pull it out and see Asuka's name on the display. As I see it the knot in my stomach tightens as I come to the realization that this is probably it. This will be the phonecall where this all ends.  
我走到这条街的一半时，突然感觉到口袋里的手机开始震动。我立刻把它拿出来，看到屏幕上显示着明日香的名字。看到这个名字，我胃里的结紧了，我意识到这可能就是那一刻。这将是一个电话，一切都将在此结束。

I actually contemplate now answering it so that I can delay hearing the news. What would be the point though? It is going to happen either way so I should face up to it.  
我其实现在考虑接电话，这样我就能推迟听到那个消息。不过，这有什么意义呢？无论如何它都会发生，所以我应该勇敢面对。

"Hello?" “喂？”

_"Kaworu!"_ I can hear the happiness in her voice and my mood dips some more, _"I just finished speaking to Shinji, where are you?"_  
“薰！”我能听出她声音里的喜悦，我的心情却更加低落，“我刚和真嗣通完电话，你在哪儿？”

"I… Decided to go out for a little walk. I thought you could probably do with some privacy considering the situation and I wasn't sure how long you would be…" I speak to her all the while trying desperately to stop my voice from cracking, "Did everything go alright?"  
"我……决定出去散会儿步。考虑到当前的情况，我想你可能需要一些私人空间，而且我不确定你会需要多长时间……" 我一边对她说话，一边拼命试图不让自己的声音颤抖，"一切还顺利吗？"

_"Hah! Of course it went alright! Managed to calm the idiot right down and he's going to go patch things up with Rei. Yet another victory for the great Asuka Langley Soryu!"_ She boasts to me and I can't help but smile.  
"哈！当然一切顺利！成功让那个白痴冷静下来，他会去和丽和好的。伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷又一次胜利了！" 她向我炫耀，我不禁微笑起来。

"I am so… happy that it went well." I feel my voice crack slightly as I speak, I hope she hasn't noticed.  
"我真是……很高兴事情进展顺利。" 我说话时声音微微颤抖，希望她没有注意到。

It turns out she did, _"Hey… Is everything alright Kaworu?"_  
原来她真的问了，“嘿… 一切都好吗，薰？”

"Yes! Yes, everything is fine. I'm just a bit cold, I forgot to bring my jacket with me and I misjudged how cold it would be this evening." It's a feeble lie but I hope she accepts it.  
“是的！是的，一切都好。我只是有点冷，我忘了带外套，而且我误判了今晚的温度。”这是个蹩脚的谎言，但我希望她能接受。

_"Oh I see… Well you should get yourself home quickly I was thinking that we should… celebrate tonight. Perhaps we should order pizza and… resume what we were doing before I had to make that phone call?"_ I hear her tone shift as she speaks the last part. It's teasing and sultry, not dissimilar to voices I've heard in certain… material.  
“哦，我明白了… 那你应该快点回家。我在想我们今晚应该… 庆祝一下。也许我们应该订披萨，然后… 继续我打电话之前我们在做的事？”我听到她的语气在说最后一部分时变了。那是挑逗而撩人的，与我曾在某些… 素材中听到的声音颇为相似。

My mind flashes back to those moments before I left. I flash back to the feeling of her lips up against mine. I remember my tongue dancing with hers and my hands exploring the curves of her body and her hands running themselves along mine. I feel my body start to react, I need to stop thinking about this, such a thing happening here would be… problematic.  
我的思绪闪回到离开前的那些时刻。我回想起她的唇紧贴着我的感觉。我记得我的舌头与她的共舞，我的手探索着她身体的曲线，而她的手也在我的身上游走。我感到身体开始有了反应，我必须停止思考这些，在这里发生这样的事将会……很麻烦。

Yet I am also confused, does this mean that her conversation with Shinji did not go how I was expecting it to? Am I wrong or is the inevitable just being delayed? I don't understand but I will return home and see what happens. Perhaps… Perhaps I am wrong and I do have the opportunity to be happy for a while longer.  
然而我也感到困惑，这是否意味着她和真嗣的对话并没有按照我预期的那样发展？是我错了，还是不可避免的事情只是被推迟了？我不明白，但我会回家看看会发生什么。或许……或许我错了，我还有机会再快乐一段时间。

### Chapter 11: Open Wide The Flood Gates  
第十一章：敞开洪流之门  

**Misato's Apartment - Rei Ayanami  
美里公寓 - 绫波零**

I have just learned from Asuka that Shinji will be returning home and now I am frightened. Asuka has assured me that she has managed to resolve the situation but I worry that she was wrong and Shinji was only pretending. I worry that when he comes through that door he will still be angry with me. I worry that he will not step through the door at all and then what will I do?  
我从明日香那里得知真嗣将要回家，现在我感到害怕。明日香向我保证她已经解决了这个问题，但我担心她可能错了，真嗣只是在假装。我担心当他走进那扇门时，他仍然会对我生气。我担心他根本不会走进那扇门，那我该怎么办？

If Asuka isn't wrong and he is on his way home then I have other, slightly more irrational fears. I am frightened what something will happen to him as he makes his way home. Asuka did not tell me the exact location Shinji had gone to, but I can only assume it is some distance from here. It would be easy for someone to hurt him.  
如果明日香没有弄错，而他正在回家的路上，那么我还有其他一些稍微更不理性的担忧。我害怕在他回家的路上会发生什么事情。明日香没有告诉我真嗣确切去了哪里，但我只能假设那地方离这里有些距离。有人要伤害他太容易了。

Yet, I know this is not a logical thought to have. For I am aware of the security teams that keep an eye on us constantly, watching and observing threats. I am aware that very few people in this town know who Shinji Ikari is and even less know the story of Third Impact. Despite all of this there is still a tiny slither of doubt in my mind. I question how safe we really are especially in the aftermath of the attack on Nagisa.  
然而，我知道这不是一个合乎逻辑的想法。因为我清楚那些时刻监视着我们、观察和防范威胁的安全团队。我也知道这个镇上很少有人知道真嗣·碇是谁，更少有人知道第三次冲击的故事。尽管如此，我的心中仍有一丝微小的疑虑。我质疑我们到底有多安全，尤其是在对渚的袭击之后。

I am also frightened that in his anger Shinji was actually correct in what he said. I worry that I really am no better than our father for what I have done. Asuka seemed to be very angry when she heard about him saying that but I wonder, was he right? Our father was a selfish man who lied and manipulated others for his own gain. Have I not done the same? Putting my friendship with Asuka ahead of the happiness of my brother and family?  
我还害怕真嗣在愤怒中说的话实际上是对的。我担心我真的没有比我们的父亲好到哪里去，因为我所做的事情。明日香听到他说这些时似乎非常生气，但我疑惑，他说得对吗？我们的父亲是一个自私的人，他撒谎并操纵他人以谋取私利。我难道没有做同样的事吗？把与明日香的友谊置于我兄弟和家庭的幸福之上？

I know this isn't true but I wonder if there is more I could have done. Perhaps I could have said more to Asuka to encourage her to return or at least communicate with Shinji and Misato. Perhaps I could have given Shinji some sort of subtle hint or even engineered a scenario that would have forced the two of them to communicate. Surely I have had opportunities over the last few years to put an end to this but I did not take or think about them. I have been passive when I should not have been.  
我知道这并非事实，但我仍不禁思索，是否还有更多我能做的。或许我本可以对明日香说更多话，鼓励她回来，或至少与真嗣和美里沟通。也许我能为真嗣提供某种微妙的暗示，甚至设计一个情境，迫使他们两人交流。过去几年里，我肯定有过结束这一切的机会，但我没有抓住，甚至没有去想。在不该被动的时候，我却选择了被动。

I glance at my phone another time to see that only a minute has passed since the last time I looked at it. Shinji has been gone for just over two hours now. He has not contacted me in all that time nor have I contacted him. At this time I am much too afraid to do so. Misato will also be returning home soon as well.  
我又一次瞥了眼手机，发现距离上次查看仅过去了一分钟。真嗣已经离开两个多小时了。这段时间里，他既没有联系我，我也没有联系他。此刻，我太过害怕这样做。美里也很快就要回家了。

Thinking about Misato also makes me scared. I am frightened of her reaction to this news, I assume that she will be told about this. After she hears this then she is likely to be angry with me. I wonder if she will still want me here after she finds out. If I am to leave then where do I go? I am able to afford somewhere on my own I suppose but it would likely take time to arrange. After what I have done I doubt one of our friends will want to have anything to do with me.  
想到美里也让我害怕。我担心她听到这个消息后的反应，我猜她会被通知到。她得知后很可能会对我发火。我不知道她还会不会想让我留在这里。如果我要离开，那我能去哪儿呢？我想我可以自己负担得起住处，但可能需要时间来安排。经历了这些，我怀疑我们的朋友还会愿意和我有任何瓜葛。

Another minute passes in silent contemplation with me sitting cross legged on the soft. Suddenly I hear a clicking sound from the hall way which causes me to spring to my feet. I rush to the entranceway and see the door opening and Shinji stepping through. He looks exhausted and the red marks around his eyes show that he has been crying. He enters the hallway and turns somewhat sheepishly to look at me.  
又过了一分钟，我静静地盘腿坐在柔软的地面上。突然，我听到走廊里传来咔嗒声，这让我立刻跳了起来。我冲到入口处，看到门正在打开，真嗣走了进来。他看起来筋疲力尽，眼睛周围的红印表明他一直在哭泣。他走进走廊，有些尴尬地转向我。

I feel myself slowly back away as he speaks, "Hey Rei… I… We have a lot to talk about, don't we?"  
他开口说话时，我感到自己慢慢后退，“嘿，绫波…我…我们有很多要谈的，不是吗？”

In that moment I feel the fear of him leave me and I rush forward and throw myself into his arms letting out a loud sob as I do so. I feel him stumble backwards as he struggles to remain on his feet and I nestle my head into his should, between my cries I try to speak, "Shinji… I… I am so sorry…"  
就在那一刻，我感到对他的恐惧消失了，我冲上前去，扑进他的怀里，放声大哭。我感觉到他在努力保持平衡，向后踉跄了几步，我把头埋在他的肩上，在哭泣中试图说话，“真嗣…我…我很抱歉…”

Shinji pauses for a moment as he recovers his balance and I feel his arms move slowly as if he is unsure of what to do. Finally though his arms wrap themselves around me and his hand gently rubs my back to calm me down. We stand like this for a few moments as I let out a few more sobs.  
真嗣停顿了一下，恢复了平衡，我感觉到他的手臂缓缓移动，似乎不确定该做什么。但最终，他的双臂环绕着我，手轻轻地抚摸我的背部，试图让我平静下来。我们就这样站了一会儿，我又抽泣了几声。

"It's alright Rei…" Shinji speaks softly, "Asuka… She explained it all to me. I… I'm not mad at you anymore, I… I'm sorry."  
“没事的，绫波…”真嗣轻声说道，“明日香…她已经向我解释了一切。我…我不再生你的气了，我…对不起。”

"You… You are not mad? But I lied to you Shinji… I… I was…" I unsure as to why I am protesting his forgiveness of me. It is that forgiveness that I wanted and was craving. I did not want Shinji to be angry at me any longer and yet I am trying to achieve the opposite of that via my words. I trail off and let him speak.  
"你…你不生气吗？可是我对你撒了谎，真嗣…我…我那时…" 我不确定为何要抗议他原谅我。那正是我渴望和期盼的宽恕。我不希望真嗣再对我生气，然而我的言语却在试图达到相反的效果。我话没说完，让他继续说下去。

Shinji merely shakes his head, "I'm not mad… I know what you did was bad Rei but… I now know why it happened. I know what position you were in and… I am sorry for what I said to you too, I should never have said you were like him. You're nothing like him Rei, it was… I went too far."  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，"我不生气…我知道你做的事很糟糕，丽，但…我现在明白为什么会发生了。我知道你当时的处境，而且…我也为我对你说的话感到抱歉，我不该说你像他。你和他完全不同，丽，是我太过分了。"

Shinji's words do bring me the comfort that I needed and yet my mind immediately wants me to protest them some more. I do not know why, why can't I accept this?  
真嗣的话确实给了我所需的安慰，然而我的内心立刻又想进一步反驳。我不知道为什么，为什么我不能接受这一点？

"But I lied…" "但我说谎了……"

"I know you did." His voice is still calm but with some weak trembling in it as if he is about to cry too, "I know… but I forgive you. I… forgive you Rei."  
"我知道你说了谎。" 他的声音依旧平静，但带着些微的颤抖，仿佛他也要哭了，"我知道……但我原谅你。我……原谅你，丽。"

This time I don't protest him, I let myself thank him instead and we release each other from the hug. I wipe my eyes free from tears and I watch him do the same with some embarrassment. He removes his shoes and the two of us go into the front room silently and sit down, me on the couch and he sits on the nearby chair.  
这次我没有反驳他，而是让自己向他道谢，我们松开了拥抱。我擦干眼泪，看着他有些尴尬地做着同样的事。他脱下鞋子，我们俩默默地走进客厅，坐了下来，我坐在沙发上，他则坐在旁边的椅子上。

At this moment I am unsure of what to say to him. He looks to be thinking about something and I want to ask what it is but I do not feel I have that right anymore. I know he must be feeling a range of emotions right now. I know he must be questioning a lot of things and I want to say something to help but what can I do or say?  
此刻，我不知该如何向他开口。他似乎在沉思，我想问他在想什么，但又觉得已无权过问。我知道他此刻必定百感交集，心中充满疑问。我想说些什么来帮助他，但又能做些什么，说些什么呢？

It is Shinji who breaks the silence, I look up to see he is smiling, "She… She actually spoke to me Rei… and… she said she will speak to me again."  
是真嗣打破了沉默，我抬头看到他在微笑，“她……她真的和我说话了，绫波……而且……她说还会再和我说话。”

"That is good." I manage to weakly smile back at him, "What did she say to you?"  
“那很好。”我勉强回以微笑，“她对你说了什么？”

Shinji glances downwards, "She… explained everything to me about why she left and you finding her in Germany. She told me all about the promise and that you were reluctant to agree to it, that you did try to persuade her each time but she refused. I… really am sorry Rei, I thought… I didn't even stop to ask for the details…"  
真嗣低头看去，“她……把为什么离开以及你在德国找到她的事情都告诉了我。她说了那个承诺，以及你当初并不情愿同意，每次都试图说服她但被拒绝的事。我……真的很抱歉，绫波，我以为……我甚至没有停下来问清楚细节……”

"I… It is okay." I reply, "Did she say anything else to you?"  
“我……没关系。”我回答，“她还跟你说了别的吗？”

Shinji nods, "Yeah… We actually had a conversation."  
真嗣点头，“嗯……我们确实聊了一会儿。”

This pleases me when I hear it. I do not recall the two of them having a proper conversation after they returned. I know they spoke immediately after Third Impact but they did not seem to communicate much beyond that. I know there was a time they communicated prior to Third Impact but even then that was a long time before it.  
这让我很高兴听到。我不记得他们回来后有过一次正式的对话。我知道他们在第三次冲击后立即交谈过，但似乎在那之后并没有太多交流。我知道在第三次冲击之前他们有过交流的时刻，但即便如此，那也是在很久之前了。

"What did you discuss?" “你们讨论了什么？”

Shinji looks up and is still smiling, "She… Told me about her book…"  
真嗣抬头，依然微笑着，“她……跟我谈了她的书……”

I find myself blushing when I realize what this means. If Asuka told him about the book then it is likely he also knows about the main character being based on me. Asuka will surely have told him of that. I look across at him, "I… Was shocked when I found out about it too."  
我发现自己意识到这一点时脸红了。如果明日香告诉他那本书的事，那么他很可能也知道主角是以我为原型的。明日香肯定会告诉他这些。我看着他，"我……当我发现这件事时也很震惊。"

"I can imagine." He almost laughs, "I… Had no idea Asuka had a creative side, she never seemed to show it when she was with us. I… I guess I never asked about it though…"  
"我能想象。" 他几乎笑出声来，"我……完全不知道明日香有创造力的一面，她跟我们在一起时从未展现过。我……我想我从未问过她这些……"

Shinji sounds dejected when he speaks so I move to reassure him, "Even if you had have asked her then she would likely have denied it. Asuka back then did not feel such things were worthy of her time, she strived to be seen as an adult and to her creative endeavors were not a part of that."  
真嗣听起来很沮丧，于是我上前安慰他，"即使你当时问了她，她也很可能会否认。那时的明日香不认为这些事情值得她花时间，她努力被视为成年人，而她的创作活动并不属于那个范畴。"

"Y-Yeah… I suppose." Shinju replies, "She also… said she wanted to attend the concert in December. She even offered to help me learn about the tracks."  
“嗯……我想是的。” 绫波回答道，“她还……说想参加十二月的音乐会。她甚至提出要帮我了解那些曲目。”

I nod, "Yeah, it is likely that she will know a lot of the tracks you are to learn. Asuka is… passionate about music. She has an extensive music collection that she has introduced me to in the past, I find that whilst I am… fond of some of it there are certain artists that I find to be a bit too much."  
我点点头，“是啊，她很可能知道你要学的很多曲目。明日香对音乐非常热衷。她有一个庞大的音乐收藏，过去她给我介绍过，我发现虽然我……喜欢其中一些，但有些艺术家我觉得有点过头了。”

Shinji lowers his head at my words and I wonder if perhaps I have said something wrong to him, "I apologize, did I say something wrong?"  
听到我的话，真嗣低下了头，我不禁疑惑自己是否说错了什么，“对不起，我说错什么了吗？”

Shinji looks up at me and shakes his head, "No… You didn't it's just… I know so little about her really. When she lived with us I didn't even bother to ask her about any of this. I didn't really talk to her about what she liked I just… reacted to things."  
真嗣抬头看着我，摇了摇头，“不……你没明白，只是……我对她真的了解太少了。她跟我们一起生活时，我甚至都没费心去问过她这些。我并没有真正和她聊过她喜欢什么，我只是……对事情做出反应。”

"You were a different person then, you were unused to her and she was not the easiest person to get along with either. Remember she shut herself away back then but now she is not like that." I say as I try to cheer him up, "Now you have an opportunity to speak to her and find out these things."  
“那时候你是个不同的人，还不习惯她，而她也不是最容易相处的人。记得她那时把自己封闭起来，但现在她不是那样了。”我试图安慰他，“现在你有机会和她交谈，了解这些事情。”

Shinji nods, "Y-Yeah… You're right I… I will do that. Does… She know a lot about me… Not that I've really done much."  
真嗣点头，“嗯……你说得对，我……我会去做的。她……她对我了解很多吗……我也没做过什么了不起的事。”

"Yes." I answer truthfully, "Asuka asked about you a number of times, she always took an interest in you and the others."  
"是的。" 我如实回答，"明日香多次问起你，她一直对你和其他人都很关心。"

"I see…" He mutters, "I guess she must have found it pretty boring then."  
"这样啊…" 他喃喃道，"我想她那时一定觉得很无聊吧。"

I shake my head, "Not at all, she was concerned about you if anything. She wanted you to be happy."  
我摇摇头，"一点也不，她其实是担心你。她希望你能快乐。"

He smiles again, "Y-Yeah…"  
他又笑了笑，“嗯……嗯……”

"Did she say when she will next be contacting you?"  
“她有没有说下次什么时候联系你？”

Shinji shakes his head, "Not exactly but it'll be soon I think. She gave me all of her contact details and she wants to send music to me. She also asked for a recording of me playing the cello. I… don't really know what to do, do I wait for her or do I contact her first?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，“没有具体说，但我想应该很快。她给了我所有的联系方式，还想要给我寄音乐。她还让我录一段大提琴演奏给她。我……不太知道该怎么办，我是该等她联系我还是我先联系她？”

"Do whatever you think is right, if you record yourself before she sends you the music then contact her first." I reply, not exactly sure how to handle this situation myself. In the back of my mind there are other questions I have about what Asuka has told Shinji but I keep those locked away for now. I will contact her myself to find out how she will approach the subject of Nagisa.  
"做你认为正确的事吧，如果她在发给你音乐之前你自己先录好了，那就先联系她。" 我回答道，其实自己也不太确定该如何处理这种情况。在我脑海深处，还有其他关于明日香告诉真嗣的事情的疑问，但我暂时将它们锁在心底。我会亲自联系她，了解她将如何处理渚的话题。

"She also… asked us to tell Misato about her as well."  
"她还……让我们也告诉美里关于她的事。"

I feel my body tense up when I hear Shinji speak those words. Fear sets in once more as my thoughts about Misato from earlier return. The fears of how she will react to this and the fears of what my future is in this place I call home.  
听到真嗣说出这些话时，我感觉自己的身体紧绷起来。早先对美里的担忧再次涌上心头，恐惧也随之而来。我害怕她对此的反应，也害怕在这个我称之为家的地方，我的未来会是什么样子。

"Rei…" I hear Shinji say as he moves close to me, "It'll be alright, I… I'll explain everything to her."  
"丽…" 我听到真嗣靠近我说，"会没事的，我…我会向她解释一切。"

I nod, "I would like to explain too… I should admit my part in this and face the consequences."  
我点头，"我也想解释…我应该承认我的责任并面对后果。"

Shinji puts his arm around me, "Rei… There won't be any consequences for this."  
真嗣搂住我，"丽…这不会有任何后果的。"

"No… You don't understand, I lied to you both. I did not tell Misato the truth about my visits to Germany and she put her trust in me. I have betrayed her trust in who I am…"  
"不…你不明白，我欺骗了你们俩。我没有告诉美里我去德国的真相，她信任我。我背叛了她对我的信任…"

Shinji pulls me towards him and hugs me gently, "It'll be alright Rei, Misato… She'll understand, I'm sure of it."  
真嗣把我拉向他，轻轻地拥抱我，"没事的，丽，美里…她会理解的，我确信。"

**Misato's Apartment - Misato Katsuragi  
美里公寓 - 葛城美里**

Exhaustion is starting to set in as I finally reach the door to the apartment. I take out my key and let out a sigh, I feel bad... No, I feel awful. Once again, I'm late home from work and late home to see Shinji and Rei. I know they don't mind and are old enough to take care of themselves but that doesn't make me feel any better about it.  
疲惫感逐渐袭来，当我终于抵达公寓门口时。我掏出钥匙，叹了口气，我感到糟糕...不，是非常糟糕。又一次，我下班回家晚了，也错过了见真嗣和绫的时间。我知道他们不会介意，也足够大能照顾自己，但这并没有让我感觉好些。

We are supposed to be a family and I'm neglecting that fact but then I've never really been very good at this. I've tried but I've always had to ask others for advice or defer to them. I love Shinji and Rei dearly but I've hardly been the mother they deserve for these past few years. I let out another sigh, this... this is the exhaustion talking and I know it.  
我们本应是一个家庭，而我却忽视了这一点，但说实话，我在这方面一直不太擅长。我尝试过，但总是需要向他人寻求建议或依赖他们。我深爱着真嗣和绫，但过去几年里，我几乎没能成为他们应得的母亲。我又叹了口气，这...这是疲惫在说话，我知道。

I've been working late so much for the past two months I've let it get to me. I've not taken the time to relax. Maybe... maybe I should make sure I come home early this Friday and we can all go away for the weekend or something. Just to get us away from this city.  
过去两个月我加班太多，这让我感到疲惫。我没有花时间放松。也许...也许我应该确保这周五早点回家，我们可以一起出去度周末什么的。只是为了让我们远离这座城市。

Maya will be able to handle whatever is happening at work. We've made progress with our plans and are getting ready to send in the first teams to search through the debris of Tokyo-3 and hopefully what is left of NERV itself. I am nervous about what we might find in there to be honest but if anything could be useful to humanity then I would like to see it extracted.  
玛雅应该能应对工作上发生的任何事情。我们的计划取得了进展，正准备派遣第一批队伍去清理东京-3 的废墟，并希望找到 NERV 的残余部分。老实说，我对可能会发现的东西感到紧张，但如果有什么对人类有用的东西，我希望能将其提取出来。

There have also been questions recently as relates to the Emergence Facility built there. The last couple of months have seen activity at the facility with more people returning and there are members of the U.N. who are concerned about who might emerge next. They are worried about 'him' coming back and to be honest so am I.  
最近，关于那里的 Emergence 设施也出现了一些疑问。过去几个月，该设施的活动有所增加，越来越多的人返回，联合国的一些成员担心接下来会出现谁。他们担心‘他’会回来，说实话，我也有同样的担忧。

Not necessarily for the same reason that they are. They worry for their jobs and status, they worry about the fact that many of them took backhanders and looked the other way when Gendo Ikari was the Commander of NERV. They worry that they might be exposed by a man who could be desperate to keep himself free.  
并非出于和他们相同的原因。他们担心自己的工作和地位，担心在碇源堂担任 NERV 指挥官时，许多人接受了贿赂并视而不见。他们担心可能会被一个急于自保的人揭露。

My worry? I worry about the effect it'll have on Shinji and Rei if he returned. I worry that it could undo all the progress the two of them have made these last few years. I worry that his return would hurt the two of them. If he were to return... I would do everything to ensure he couldn't harm them again. I would protect them with everything I have.  
我的担忧？我担心他的归来会对真嗣和绫波产生的影响。我担心这可能会破坏他们俩过去几年所取得的进步。我担心他的回归会伤害到他们。如果他真的回来了...我会尽一切努力确保他不能再伤害他们。我会用尽全力保护他们。

I need to stop thinking about these things, I need to actually get inside the apartment and get changed into something more comfortable. I can warm up whatever leftovers there are and take a long bath. I finally open the door and announce my return, "I'm home!"  
我需要停止思考这些事情，我需要真正进入公寓，换上更舒适的衣服。我可以加热剩下的食物，然后洗个长长的澡。我终于打开门，宣布我的归来，“我回来了！”

"Welcome home!" Comes the joint reply from Shinji and Rei.  
“欢迎回家！”真嗣和绫波齐声回答。

I smile weakly as I make my way down the hallway and towards the front room, ready to apologize to the two of them but I stop when I see the two of them are already stood up waiting for me to enter. Both of them are wearing similar expressions and almost immediately my heart leaps into my mouth, "What's wrong? Has something happened?"  
我虚弱地笑了笑，沿着走廊走向前厅，准备向他们两人道歉，但当我看到他们已经站起身来等我进去时，我停下了脚步。他们俩的表情如出一辙，我的心几乎立刻提到了嗓子眼，“怎么了？发生什么事了吗？”

They both exchange a look and I see Shinji nod slowly. He steps forward, "Nothing... is wrong it's just... We both have something to tell you and we know you have had a long day but we thought it'd be best to tell you now, rather than wait."  
他们交换了一个眼神，我看到真嗣缓缓点头。他走上前，“没什么……不对劲，只是……我们都有事要告诉你，我们知道你今天很累，但我们觉得最好现在告诉你，而不是等到以后。”

Despite him saying nothing is wrong I find it hard to believe that, the tone of his voice definitely indicates that something is up. I look at Rei and she looks uncharacteristically nervous, she is struggling to make eye contact with me and unless I'm mistaken I can see her legs trembling. Something is definitely wrong with the two of them.  
尽管他说没什么不对劲，但我很难相信，他的语气明显表明有什么事情。我看向绫波，她看起来异常紧张，她努力避免与我对视，除非我看错了，我甚至能看到她的双腿在颤抖。他们俩肯定有什么问题。

"Okay..." I slide off my jacket and hang it over a chair, "What is it?"  
"好吧..." 我脱下外套，挂在椅背上，"怎么了？"

I follow as the two of them sit themselves down on the sofa, I sit on the chair and my mind starts to trick over the reasons as to why they're acting like this. Could one of them have been attacked? I can't see any visible marks on either of them so I'm not sure. It seems improbably though, after we heard about the attack on Nagisa in Germany we tightened security here. I would know if either one of them was attacked or threatened.  
我跟着他们俩坐在沙发上，自己则坐在椅子上，脑海中开始猜测他们如此表现的原因。难道其中一人被袭击了？我看不出他们身上有明显的伤痕，所以不太确定。尽管如此，这似乎不太可能，自从我们听说 Nagisa 在德国遇袭后，这里的安全措施就加强了。如果他们中的任何一个受到攻击或威胁，我会知道的。

Rei seems to be the one most affected by this, could it then be something to do with her? I know she has just started seeing someone. Could it be that she is pr- No... That can't be it at all. Rei is seeing Kodama, Hikari's sister so there is no chance of Rei getting pregnant there.  
Rei 似乎是受影响最大的，那么问题会不会与她有关？我知道她最近刚开始和某人交往。难道是她怀孕了？不...那不可能。Rei 正在和 Kodama 交往，Hikari 的妹妹，所以 Rei 怀孕的可能性不存在。

What about Shinji then? No, I doubt that Shinji would get someone pregnant, I don't even know if he has had that sort of contact with anyone before and I'm not going to ask. This is Shinji though, I know if he would probably be careful if he were to do that.  
那真嗣呢？不，我怀疑真嗣会让别人怀孕，我甚至不知道他以前是否有过那种接触，我也不打算问。但这是真嗣，我知道如果他真的那样做，他可能会很小心。

I'm not sure why my mind leapt straight to the idea of Rei being pregnant or Rei getting someone pregnant though. It doesn't seem likely for either of them. I guess perhaps I do have some sort of motherly instincts after all, is that not what parents worry about?  
我不确定为什么我的脑海会直接跳到绫波怀孕或绫波让别人怀孕的想法。这对他们俩来说似乎都不太可能。我想也许我毕竟还是有一些母性本能的，这不正是父母担心的事情吗？

I glance around the apartment. Nothing within seems to be broken so it can't be there. Unless of course they have been in and broken something in my room, in which case they'd probably be improving it. I really can't guess at what the problem might be. I still don't know if there is a problem, Shinji said there wasn't but from the way the two of them look and are acting I don't believe that.  
我环顾公寓四周。似乎没有什么东西被打破，所以问题不在这里。除非他们进过我的房间并打碎了什么东西，那样的话他们可能是在改进它。我真的猜不出问题可能是什么。我仍然不确定是否真的有问题，真嗣说没有，但从他们俩的表情和行为来看，我不相信。

"So, what exactly is this about?" I ask.  
"那么，这究竟是怎么一回事？" 我问道。

Again, the two of them look at each other and once again it is Shinji who nods and then speaks, "It... It's about Asuka..."  
他们俩再次对视，这次又是真嗣点头，然后开口说道："这... 这是关于明日香的事..."

I realize I probably look like an idiot but on hearing him speak those word my mouth hangs open. Those are some words I enver expected to hear Shinji speak, I never expected to hear him utter her name, he hasn't said it since she left. If I was ever to hear something about her I was sure it'd be from Fuyutsuki or even from Asuka herself.  
我意识到自己可能看起来像个傻瓜，但听到他说出这些话时，我的嘴巴不由自主地张开了。这些话是我从未预料到会从真嗣口中听到的，我从未想过他会提起她的名字，自从她离开后，他就再也没有说过。如果我曾想过会听到关于她的事情，我肯定那会是从冬月先生甚至是明日香本人那里听到的。

Hearing her name frightens me, it's been so long and I never expected to hear from her again. I had hoped we would but as time went on it seemed less and less likely. I start to fear the worst, the sombre tone of Shinji's voice and the way Rei is avoiding speaking.  
听到她的名字让我惊恐，已经过去太久，我从未想过还会再听到她的消息。我曾希望如此，但随着时间的推移，这似乎越来越不可能。我开始担心最坏的情况，真嗣那沉重的语气和绫波回避说话的方式。

"What about Asuka?" I start to ask frantically, "Have you heard something? Has she been hurt? Is she okay?"  
“那明日香呢？”我焦急地问道，“你们有没有听到什么？她受伤了吗？她还好吗？”

"We... We heard from her today Misato and she is okay." Shinji replied immediately.  
“我们……我们今天收到了她的消息，美里，她没事。”真嗣立刻回答道。

"You heard from her?" I exclaim in surprise, "How? What happened? Is she here?"  
"你听说了她的消息？" 我惊讶地喊道，"怎么回事？发生了什么？她在这里吗？"

Shinji shakes his head, "No, she is in Germany and she... called me."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"不，她在德国，而且……她给我打了电话。"

Asuka called him? My first thought bizarrely is how much calling Japan from Germany must have cost but then I realize Asuka was given a vast payout and can likely afford it. My second thought is to why and how she contacted Shinji.  
明日香给他打电话了？我第一个奇怪的想法是，从德国打给日本一定很贵吧，但随即我意识到明日香得到了一大笔钱，很可能负担得起。我的第二个想法是，她为什么以及如何联系上真嗣的。

I look towards both Shinji and Rei for an explanation and both seem to be struggling to come up with what to say. I have to admit I don't really know what to say myself. I want to feel happy that Asuka is alive and well, I had always feared the worst for her. When she left she cut off all contact, I had no idea what had happened to her, only Fuyutsuki's reassurance but after a time even he seemed unsure.  
我转向真嗣和丽寻求解释，两人似乎都在努力想该说什么。我不得不承认，我自己也不知道该说什么。我本该为明日香活着且安然无恙感到高兴，我曾一直为她担心最坏的情况。她离开时切断了所有联系，我完全不知道她发生了什么，只有冬月老师的保证，但过了一段时间，连他似乎也不确定了。

"How did it happen? How did she get in contact with you Shinji?"  
“这是怎么发生的？她是怎么联系上你的，真嗣？”

Shinji looks up at me, "She… got my phone number from Rei… It was to… sort out an incident that occurred earlier today."  
真嗣抬头看着我，“她……从丽那里得到了我的电话号码……是为了……处理今天早些时候发生的一起事件。”

"But… How did she get your number?" I ask.  
“但是……她是怎么拿到你的号码的？”我问道。

I see Rei flinch slightly but then she looks up at me, I can see tears in her eyes and she finally speaks, her voice is soft and shaky, "Perhaps I should explain."  
我看到丽微微一颤，然后她抬头看向我，我看到她眼中有泪光，她终于开口了，声音轻柔而颤抖，“或许我应该解释一下。”

I nod, "Please do…" 我点点头，“请说……”

"Asuka was able to get Shinji's number because I told her it." She looks at Shinji who just gives her a small nod, "I was able to tell her it because I have been in contact with her for the past three and a half years."  
“因为是我告诉明日香真嗣的号码，所以她才能联系上他。”她看向真嗣，后者只是微微点头，“我能告诉她是因为过去三年半里我一直与她保持联系。”

I smile and nod and then the reality of her words hits me. I feel my mouth open in shock as I look between Rei and Shinji. I see Rei lower her head again and a tear roll silently down her cheek. I see Shinji reach for her hand and stroke it gently. I don't quite know what to say to that, "Three and a half years? Contact… how? When?"  
我微笑点头，随即她的话让我震惊。我惊讶地张开嘴，目光在丽和真嗣之间来回。我看到丽再次低下头，一滴泪无声滑落脸颊。我看到真嗣伸手去握她的手，轻轻抚摸。我一时语塞，“三年半？联系……怎么联系的？什么时候？”

Rei doesn't make eye contact with me, "When I went to Europe for the first time it was… to find Asuka. I was successful in my attempt."  
丽没有与我目光接触，“我第一次去欧洲的时候……是为了找明日香。我成功了。”

I cast my mind back, I do recall thinking back then that it seemed strange for Rei to want to visit Germany all of a sudden. I didn't bother to pursue that though, after all if I was unable to find Asuka then I doubted Rei would have been able to. It seems that I was wrong, not only that, but Rei didn't tell me or Shinji about it.  
我回想起那时，确实觉得丽突然想去德国有些奇怪。不过我并没有深究，毕竟如果我找不到明日香，我也不认为丽能找到。看来我错了，不仅如此，丽还没有告诉我和真嗣这件事。

I admit I'm quite mad at her, I trusted her on that trip to do what she said she was going to. If she had come to me and told me she wanted to find Asuka I would have supported her in that. I'm also mad that she didn't tell me or Shinji that she found Asuka but as I look at him I can only imagine how Shinji must have felt when he found this out.  
我承认我对她相当生气，我信任她在那次旅行中会做她承诺的事。如果她来找我，告诉我她想找到明日香，我会支持她的。我也很生气她没有告诉我或真嗣她找到了明日香，但当我看着他时，我只能想象真嗣得知这一切时的心情。

I will remain calm for the moment, I need to learn more about this. I suspect there is more to this story than I have been told so far.  
我暂时要保持冷静，我需要了解更多关于这件事的信息。我怀疑这个故事还有更多我尚未被告知的部分。

"So you found her, how come you didn't say anything?"  
“所以你找到她了，怎么不早说？”

Rei hesitates for a moment but then speaks, "Asuka… asked me to not tell anyone. She said she was not ready for other people to know. I tried… I tried but she did not want anyone else but me to know about her and her whereabouts. I… accepted her friendship but continued to lie to you and Shinji. I… I am sorry."  
绫波犹豫了一下，然后开口道：“明日香……让我不要告诉任何人。她说她还没准备好让别人知道。我试过……我试过，但她只希望我知道她和她的行踪。我……接受了她的友谊，却继续对你和真嗣撒谎。我……我很抱歉。”

Seeing Rei cry is an unusual sight and one I am witnessing right now. I watch as Shinji calmly puts an arm around her to calm her down. I decide to leave Rei for the moment and turn my attention to Shinji, "When did you find out?"  
看到绫波哭泣是件罕见的事，而我此刻正目睹这一幕。我看着真嗣平静地伸出一只手臂搂住她，试图安抚她。我决定暂时让绫波一个人待着，转而把注意力转向真嗣，“你是什么时候知道的？”

"Earlier today." He admits, "I… accidentally saw a message from her on Rei's phone. Rei admitted she had been in contact with Asuka after that."  
"今天早些时候。" 他承认道，"我……不小心在丽手机上看到了她的消息。丽承认在那之后一直与明日香保持联系。"

"And then what happened?"  
"然后发生了什么？"

"We had… an argument." Shinji lowers his eyes, "I… left the apartment and not long after that Asuka called me to put things right. She wanted me to know that it was all Asuka's fault and not Rei's at all. She also asked us to tell you about it too… She said that if you wanted to speak to her you could contact her."  
"我们……吵了一架。" 真嗣垂下眼帘，"我……离开了公寓，不久后明日香打电话来想和解。她想让我知道这一切都是明日香的错，与丽无关。她还让我们也告诉你这件事……她说如果你愿意和她谈谈，可以联系她。"

I nod my head, "I think I'll do just that then but it can wait. For now I need to deal with this, Shinji… could you please leave us. I'd like to speak to Rei alone."  
我点点头，“我想我会那样做，但可以稍等。现在我需要处理这件事，真嗣……你能请离开一下吗？我想单独和绫波谈谈。”

I try to soften my voice to try to keep Rei calm but I hear a small sob escape her as I say those words. Shinji looks at her with a worried expression but after a time she nods, "It is… alright Shinji."  
我试图用柔和的语气让绫波保持平静，但当我这么说时，听到她发出了一声轻微的抽泣。真嗣担忧地看着她，过了一会儿，她点点头，“没关系的，真嗣。”

Shinji nods back and goes into his bedroom. I take the opportunity to move over to the couch and put an arm around Rei, "Rei…"  
真嗣点头回应，走进了自己的卧室。我趁机走到沙发旁，搂住绫波，“绫波……”

"I am sorry…" She sniffs between her words and I feel her body shake as she starts to cry. I pull the girl towards me and gently rub her back. I am admittedly lost for words right now, I don't quite know how to deal with this but would anyone know? It wasn't a situation I ever planned for.  
"我很抱歉…" 她说话间抽泣着，我感觉到她的身体在颤抖，因为她开始哭泣。我拉过女孩，轻轻地抚摸她的背。老实说，我现在词穷了，不太知道如何应对这种情况，但谁又能知道呢？这不是我曾预料到的局面。

"Are you mad at me?"  
"你生我的气吗？"

I nod and decide that it would probably be best to be honest with her. I'm certainly not about to yell at her or anything but she does need to know that I'm not exactly happy with this situation, "A little bit, I trusted you when I let you go to Germany for the first time. I expected your reasons for going to be exactly what you told me. I also expect that your other trips there and to Europe have involved seeing her too?"  
我点点头，决定最好还是对她坦诚。我当然不会对她大吼大叫，但她需要知道我对这个情况并不完全满意，"有点生气，我信任你，才让你第一次去德国。我以为你去的原因就是你告诉我的那样。我也希望你之后的那些去德国和欧洲的行程，并没有包括见她？"

"Yes, they have." Rei admits.  
"是的，他们有。" 丽承认道。

"I see." I try to sound stern when I speak but it's hard to muster up anything like that when Rei is crying in front of me, "I wish you had told me your intentions the first time Rei, I could have helped you. I would have helped and supported you."  
"我明白了。" 我试图用严厉的语气说话，但在丽在我面前哭泣时，很难装出那种样子，"我希望你第一次就有告诉我你的意图，丽，我本可以帮你。我会帮助你，支持你。"

"I am sorry. I did not… I did not think I would be successful, so I did not tell you or Shinji and then… I made that promise to her."  
"我很抱歉。我没有……我没有想到会成功，所以我没告诉你或真嗣，然后……我向她许下了那个承诺。"

"The promise that you would not tell us about her?"  
"你承诺过不会告诉我们关于她的事？"

Rei nods, "Yes, I… I tried to persuade her to come back each time I saw her but she did not think she could. She… thought that you and Shinji disliked her for who she used to be. She… was frightened."  
绫波点头，“是的，我……每次见到她，我都试图说服她回来，但她觉得做不到。她……认为你和真嗣讨厌过去的她。她……很害怕。”

My stomach twists as Rei says that. Asuka really thought that I disliked her? The worst thing is I can't blame her, I didn't do a lot to help Asuka, not as much as I should have done. I treated her like the adult she thought she wanted to be despite the fact that I knew otherwise. I went down that same damn path myself, I should have put an end to it. I should have gotten her to talk but I… I didn't.  
听到绫波这么说，我的胃一阵绞痛。明日香真的以为我讨厌她吗？最糟糕的是，我无法责怪她，我没有尽力帮助明日香，没有做到我应该做的。尽管我知道事实并非如此，我还是把她当作她自认为想要成为的成年人来对待。我自己也走上了那条该死的路，我本应该阻止这一切。我本应该让她开口说话，但我……我没有。

"What will happen to me?" Rei suddenly asks.  
"我会怎么样？" 丽突然问道。

I look at her in confusion, "What do you mean?"  
我困惑地看着她，"你是什么意思？"

"I lied to you and Shinji, I was… disloyal and I am undeserving of your care… I… I will leave if you desire."  
"我对你们撒了谎，真嗣，我……不忠，我不配得到你们的关心……我……如果你们希望，我会离开。"

I look at her in a stunned silence for a moment before laughing, "Rei, I'm not going to kick you out and I don't want you to leave. Nothing will happen to you I… I just wish you would have said something in the first place but… this seems more complicated then you just lying. If you had have told us then… it would have hurt Asuka and she's had her share of pain."  
我震惊地沉默了一会儿，然后笑道：“丽，我不会赶你走，也不希望你离开。你不会有事的，我……我只是希望你一开始就告诉我，但……这似乎比你撒谎要复杂得多。如果你当时告诉了我们……那会让明日香受伤，她已经承受了很多痛苦。”

"I did not like deceiving either of you, I know how much Shinji misses her. I tried to tell her but she…"  
“我也不想欺骗你们中的任何一个，我知道真嗣有多想念她。我试图告诉她，但她……”

"Is stubborn?" I smile as I see Rei hesitate but also nod, "I'll speak to her tomorrow Rei and see what she has to say. I think… based on how you are now and this argument between you and Shinji you've probably been punished enough but in the future I want you to be honest with me, you could have been hurt or worse. Do you understand?"  
“很固执吗？”我微笑着，看到丽犹豫了一下，但还是点了点头，“我明天会和她谈谈，看看她怎么说。我想……基于你现在的情况和与真嗣的争执，你已经受到了足够的惩罚，但将来我希望你能对我诚实，你本可能会受伤甚至更糟。你明白吗？”

Rei nods, "Yes, I do. I am sorry."  
丽点点头，“是的，我明白。我很抱歉。”

"It's fine. I'll order us food tonight after I've gotten changed. You can go and get Shinji too and tell him to decide what he wants."  
“没关系。我换好衣服后会订餐。你可以去叫真嗣，让他决定想吃什么。”

"Yes, I will. Thank you."  
“好的，我会去。谢谢你。”

I give Rei another hug and get up off the couch and slip into my room letting out another sigh. This was not exactly how I expected my evening to go. Of all the people I expected to deal with in the next few days Asuka was not one of them. I don't even know what I'm going to say to her really, I can't really be mad at her for asking Rei to promise that, it was up to Asuka and I don't blame her for not wanting to see me.  
我又给了丽一个拥抱，从沙发上起身，悄悄走进自己的房间，又叹了口气。今晚的发展完全出乎我的意料。在接下来几天里，我预想过会面对很多人，但明日香绝不在其中。我甚至不知道该对她说些什么，我不能因为她让丽做出那个承诺而生气，那是明日香的决定，我不会因为她不想见我而责怪她。

Still, I am relieved to know she is alright. The poor girl deserves happiness after all she has gone through and I hope she has been able to find it in the last four and a half years.  
尽管如此，得知她安然无恙我还是松了口气。这个可怜的女孩经历了那么多，理应得到幸福，我希望在过去四年半的时间里，她已经找到了。

**Kaworu's Apartment – Asuka Langley Soryu  
渚薰的公寓 —— 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I slowly open my eyes and find myself looking up at an unfamiliar - well actually it isn't entirely unfamiliar to me, but I suppose in this situation it certainly is - ceiling. This particular ceiling belongs to Kaworu's bedroom, and I am currently lying, wrapped up in a duvet on his bed. His bed is warm and comfortable and I dislike the idea of leaving it but as I glance over at his alarm clock for the time I can see it's already past ten and I have things to do today.  
我缓缓睁开眼，发现自己正仰望着一个陌生的——好吧，其实对我来说并不完全陌生，但在这个情境下确实如此——天花板。这个天花板属于渚薰的卧室，而我正裹着羽绒被躺在他的床上。他的床温暖舒适，我并不想离开，但当我瞥向他的闹钟看时间时，发现已经过了十点，今天我还有事情要做。

Naturally the space next to me is empty, Kaworu will have gotten up a few hours ago to get ready and go to work. A smirk comes to my lips as I imagine the sight of him getting out of bed carefully to not wake me. All I can imagine is the same scenario that I bared witness to in my apartment some weeks ago. The image of him scrambling around trying to quickly get his pants on and tripping over them.  
自然，我旁边的位置是空的，渚薰几个小时前就起床准备去上班了。我嘴角勾起一抹笑意，想象着他小心翼翼地起床，以免吵醒我。我脑海中浮现的，仍是几周前在我公寓里目睹的那一幕。他慌忙地试图穿上裤子，却不慎被绊倒的画面。

I laugh as I remember him falling to the floor accompanied by the look of embarrassment and frustration on his face. I had already decided that he was cute but that clumsiness just added to it. I wonder if it was a similar situation this morning, I wonder if he still had the same difficulties as he tried to get his clothes on. I have noticed he has his moments of clumsiness, tripping here and there and his cooking did leave a few cuts and burns on his hands.  
我笑着回忆起他跌倒在地的情景，以及他脸上那尴尬和沮丧的表情。我早已觉得他很可爱，而那份笨拙更是锦上添花。不知道今早是否也是类似的情形，他是否还在穿衣时遇到同样的困难。我注意到他有时确实会笨手笨脚，时不时绊倒，而他的厨艺也在他手上留下了几处刀伤和烫伤。

Either that or he wasn't clumsy at all. He stood up straight and tall as he put his suit on. Slipping into those tight trousers that make his ass look so perfect. Buttoning up his shirt to cover up his pale but strong body. Putting on his tie and jacket making himself look professional and handsome.  
要么就是他根本不笨拙。他笔直地站立，穿上西装。套进那紧身裤，让他的臀部显得如此完美。扣上衬衫，遮住他苍白却强健的身体。系上领带，穿上外套，让自己看起来既专业又英俊。

I need to stop thinking about this, I have things to do but as I stretch myself out in the bed I can't help but think about how comfortable and warm I am right now. Not only that but I slept so well! I didn't have, nor was there even the threat of any bad dreams. It was so nice to fall asleep next to someone I... something I care about deeply.  
我得停止想这些，我还有事情要做，但当我躺在床上伸展身体时，忍不住想到现在自己有多舒适和温暖。不仅如此，我还睡得非常好！没有噩梦，甚至连噩梦的威胁都没有。能睡在我在意的人身边，真是太好了……这是我深切关心的事情。

That through brings me back to some of the questions I've been asking myself since we kissed on Friday, no actually, I've been asking them since I met Kaworu. How do I feel about him? On Friday I finally came to the decision that I want to be more than friends with him but what does that make us now? Boyfriend and girlfriend? It's a weird concept for me, I never imagined having someone like that but I suppose I do now. We've surpassed simple friendship, I mean you don't make out with your friends like we have been.  
这让我回想起自从上周五我们接吻后，不，其实是从我遇见渚薰以来，一直在问自己的那些问题。我对他的感觉如何？上周五我终于下定决心，想要与他超越朋友关系，但那我们现在算什么呢？男女朋友？这个概念对我来说很陌生，我从未想象过会有这样的人，但我想我现在确实有了。我们已经超越了简单的友谊，我是说，你不会像我们那样和朋友们亲热。

Well... except for that one night with Rei of course. That was however a different matter and one of many interesting nights revolving around Rei. I have to smile, that girl has grown a hell of a lot since I met her all those years ago. She isn't wild by any means but it's nice to see that she has been able to grow. She is also slightly more open to experimentation than I expected. I would never have considered making out with a girl but me and Rei decided it might be fun and... well it was. I mean I'm not really wired that way but if I was then... I guess Rei would be my first choice.  
嗯...当然，除了和丽共度的那一晚。不过那是另一回事，也是围绕着丽的许多有趣夜晚之一。我不得不微笑，那个女孩自从多年前我遇见她以来，已经成长了许多。她绝非放纵之人，但看到她能够成长，真是令人欣慰。她对尝试新事物的开放程度也超出了我的预期。我从未想过会和一个女孩亲吻，但我和丽觉得这可能会很有趣，而...确实如此。我的意思是，我并不是那种性格，但如果我是的话...我想丽会是我的首选。

I let my thoughts return to Kaworu. I have a boyfriend now I suppose, I mean we haven't spoken about what we are and I don't know if we will. Being honest I don't really know what to say in those sort of situations, I've not been here before. We'll just have to see how this develops but I know my feelings for him are real and I want to be with him.  
我让自己的思绪回到薰身上。我想我现在有了男朋友，我是说，我们还没谈过我们的关系，也不知道会不会谈。老实说，我真不知道在这种情境下该说些什么，我以前从未经历过。我们只能看看这段关系会如何发展，但我清楚自己对他的感情是真切的，我希望能和他在一起。

I do question if he has those feelings for me too. Are his feelings real or am I just the first girl to come along and show feelings for him? Is this something I should ask him or should I just wait and see how it goes? Maybe I shouldn't think about it now and just enjoy this.  
我确实怀疑他是否对我也有那种感觉。他的感情是真心的吗，还是我只是第一个出现并对他表达感情的女孩？我应该问他这件事，还是应该静观其变？也许我现在不应该多想，只是享受这段时光。

What I am certain of is that I feel a safety from him that I've not felt before. It's the reason why I shared a bed with him last night and the reason I had no nightmares. Last night we kissed and made out some more and fell asleep next to one another.  
我确信的是，我从他那里感受到了前所未有的安全感。这就是为什么昨晚我和他同床共枕，也是为什么我没有做噩梦的原因。昨晚我们接吻，缠绵了一会儿，然后相拥而眠。

Things went no further than that, I could of course feel his body reacting to what we were doing. It wasn't as if my body hadn't reacted either to it either. Despite this he made no moves to try anything related to that and I didn't do anything to him. I'm glad because I'm not ready for anything like that just yet. My body might be reacting but my mind is far from willing and I get the feeling this might be true for Kaworu as well.  
事情没有进一步发展，当然我能感觉到他的身体对我们所做的事情有所反应。我的身体也不是没有反应。尽管如此，他没有试图做任何与那相关的事情，我也没有对他做什么。我很高兴，因为我还没有准备好接受那样的事情。我的身体可能有反应，但我的思想远未准备好，我感觉这可能对渚也是一样的。

I look around the room a final time before deciding that as nice and warm as this is it is actually time for me to get up. I climb out of the bed and feel my bare feet make contact with the soft carpets. I stretch once again and start to head out of the room. I actually feel remarkably refreshed this morning and that isn't just related to getting a good night's sleep. The phone call to Shinji has also helped, it's lifted a weight from me that I've been carrying for so long.  
我环顾房间最后一眼，决定尽管这里既舒适又温暖，但确实是我该起床的时候了。我爬出床铺，赤脚感受到柔软地毯的触感。再次伸展身体后，我开始走出房间。今天早上我感到异常神清气爽，这不仅仅是因为睡了个好觉。给真嗣的电话也帮了大忙，它卸下了我长久以来背负的重担。

As the memories of yesterday's phone call enter my head I start to get that familiar feeling of nervousness in my stomach. What happened yesterday was only the beginning, there is still some way to go. I said I'd contact him again and I will also have to face Misato at some point too. It's likely I'll have to face the others as well. It's too late for me to back out now though, I'm sick of running away and fed up of having that fear of them hating me.  
当昨天电话的记忆涌入脑海时，我开始感到那种熟悉的紧张感在胃里翻腾。昨天发生的事只是个开始，还有很长的路要走。我说过会再联系他，也迟早得面对美里。很可能我还得面对其他人。但现在退缩已经太迟了，我厌倦了逃避，受够了那种害怕他们恨我的恐惧。

Shortly after the phone call last night Shinji sent me and e-mail with the proposed set list for his concert. I had my entire music library on my laptop so it was just a matter of me and Kaworu going through it and finding the tracks that had been performed by or with an orchestra. For some tracks I sent along two versions, one of the band playing with an orchestra and the other of the song being performed by an orchestra. Hopefully it'll help him. I've uploaded all of the tracks to my online storage, I just need to send him the link and that'll be done.  
昨晚电话后不久，真嗣就给我发了一封电子邮件，附上了他音乐会的拟定曲目单。我的笔记本电脑里存有整个音乐库，所以只需我和薰一起浏览，找出那些由乐队与管弦乐队合作演奏或纯由管弦乐队演奏的曲目。有些曲目我甚至提供了两个版本，一个是乐队与管弦乐队合奏，另一个则是纯管弦乐队版本。希望这能对他有所帮助。我已经将所有曲目上传到了我的在线存储空间，只需把链接发给他，这事就算完成了。

I can do that after I've spoken to him today, I need to find out how things went with Misato. I also need to see how Rei is doing and I guess I should tell him about my friendship with Kaworu. I can't imagine how that is going to go. Will he have the same hatred for him that Rei does? I can't imagine Shinji being like that, he'll be conflicted and confused. That's just his way.  
今天和他通话后我就可以做这件事了，我得了解一下他和美里之间的情况。同时，我也需要关心一下绫波的近况，并且我想我应该告诉他我和薰的友谊。我无法想象这会如何发展。他会像绫波那样对薰抱有同样的厌恶吗？我无法想象真嗣会那样，他肯定会感到矛盾和困惑。这就是他的性格。

I make my way into the front room and I can't deny it feels quite weird stepping out of Kaworu's bedroom like this. More so the fact that he isn't here. I'm so used to sleeping on his couch and waking up at roughly the same time that he does. This is different, I was in his bedroom… I was in his bed… it's just… strange but it also feels right in its own way. It feels nice.  
我走进客厅，不得不承认这样从渚薰的卧室出来感觉很奇怪。更奇怪的是他不在。我已经习惯了睡在他的沙发上，醒来时差不多和他同一时间。这次不同，我在他的卧室里……我在他的床上……虽然奇怪，但也有种说不出的对劲。感觉挺好的。

I cross over into the bathroom to take a shower and do various other things that I need to do. I finish up in the bathroom and throw on a change of clothes that I've brought with me. It's then that I realize I'm actually running out of clothing. I did go and get a couple of things at the weekend but I didn't know how long I'd be staying for, I still don't but after last night it might be a while. I need to go back and get fresh underwear and a few other things.  
我走进浴室洗澡，做些其他需要做的事情。洗完澡后，我换上了带来的干净衣服。这时我才意识到我的衣服快用完了。周末我确实买了几件东西，但不知道会住多久，现在还是不确定，但经过昨晚，可能要住上一阵子了。我得回去拿些新的内衣和其他东西。

I go into the kitchen and spy a set of keys lying on top of a note addressed to me.  
我走进厨房，看到一串钥匙放在一张给我的便条上。

'Asuka, '明日香，

_I apologize for leaving without waking you but you looked so peaceful as your slept I did not dare disturb you. I've left you this set of keys in case you need to go out today. They're my spare set and I want you to have them so you can come and go as you please.  
我为离开时未唤醒你而道歉，但你睡得如此安详，我不忍打扰。我留给你这串钥匙，以防你今天需要外出。这是我的备用钥匙，希望你收下，这样你就可以自由出入。_

_I was unsure if you would want to return to your apartment today or not but if not then please know that you are welcome to stay for as long as you want. If you need a place to store your things there is a lot of space in the wardrobes and drawers, as you may have noticed I do not own a lot of clothing so you can bring whatever you want. Also feel free to make use of anything inside the apartment, all I have is yours whilst you stay.  
我不确定你是否想今天回自己的公寓，但如果不回去，请知道你随时欢迎留在这里。如果你需要存放物品，衣柜和抽屉有很多空间，你可能已经注意到我不怎么添置衣物，所以你可以带任何你想带的东西。另外，请随意使用公寓里的任何东西，你住在这里时，我的一切都是你的。_

_Hopefully I will see you this evening.  
希望今晚能见到你。_

_Kaworu xxx' 渚薰 xxx'_

As I put the note down I'm aware that I am blushing, damn idiot putting three kisses on the bottom has gotten me to blush. Just wait until I see him later, I'm going to kiss him so much he won't know what to do with himself. Just you wait Kaworu, you will be seeing me tonight!  
放下纸条时，我意识到自己脸红了，该死的傻瓜在下面画了三个吻，让我脸红不已。等着瞧吧，等我晚点见到他，我要亲得他不知所措。渚薰，你等着，今晚你就能见到我了！

I leave the keys on the counter for now, thoughts of what to do with Kaworu can wait as can my returning to my apartment to get more clothes. I don't want to put this off any longer, I have a phone call to make. I grab my phone and select his number, hoping that he will be around to answer it.  
我把钥匙暂时放在柜台上，关于如何处理渚薰的事情可以稍后再考虑，回公寓取更多衣服也一样。我不想再拖延了，我得打个电话。我拿起手机，选中他的号码，希望他能接听。

The phone rings twice and he answers, _"A-Asuka! Hey!"_  
电话响了两声，他接了起来，"A-明日香！嘿！"

"Hello Shinji." I feel myself smile as I speak, "How are you today?"  
“你好，真嗣。”我说话时忍不住微笑，“你今天怎么样？”

_"I'm good!"_ He answers back enthusiastically, _"How… How are you?"_  
"我很好！" 他热情地回答，"你……你怎么样？"

I let out a yawn as I walk towards the couch and sit myself down in front of my laptop, "Good… Tired, just work up less than half an hour ago."  
我一边打哈欠一边走向沙发，坐在笔记本电脑前，"不错……有点累，刚起床不到半小时。"

_"Oh… I'm not bothering you am I?"  
"哦……我没有打扰你吧？"_

I look at the phone dumbfounded for a moment, "Shinji… I'm the one who called you!"  
我盯着手机愣了一会儿，“真嗣…是我给你打的电话！”

_"Oh yeah… sorry."_ I hear him reply sheepishly.  
“哦，对哦…抱歉。”我听到他尴尬地回答。

I shake my head, "Do you have time to talk? I thought maybe we could pick up where we left off last night?"  
我摇了摇头，“你现在有时间聊聊吗？我在想，我们或许可以继续昨晚的话题？”

_"Yeah… Rei is out on a date and Misato isn't due in for another hour so I'm not really doing anything."  
“是啊……丽出去约会了，美里还要一个小时才到，所以我也没什么事情做。”_

"Good." I nod wondering where I should start. I don't really want to mention Kaworu just yet. I guess I should find out what happened after we stopped talking last night first, "Were you able to patch things up with Rei?"  
“很好。”我点头思索着该从何说起。我还不打算提到渚薰。我想我应该先了解一下昨晚我们停止交谈后发生了什么，“你和丽和好了吗？”

_"Y-Yeah… I… apologized to her for what I said too…"  
“嗯-嗯……我……也为我说的话向她道歉了……”_

"Good, how is she doing?"  
"好，她怎么样了？"

_"She still feels bad thought… I said she should contact you but she is worried you'll be angry at her…"  
"她还是感觉不好……我说她应该联系你，但她担心你会生她的气……"_

"Idiot…" I sigh, Rei can be as bad as Shinji sometimes, "Tell her to phone me when she gets back."  
"傻瓜……" 我叹了口气，丽有时候和真嗣一样糟糕，"告诉她回来后给我打电话。"

_"Yeah I will..."_ Shinji pauses for a moment, I sense that he has something else to say so I wait for him. Finally, his voice returns, _"We... We told Misato about it too."_  
"嗯，我会去的……" 真嗣顿了一下，我感觉到他还有话要说，于是我等着他。终于，他的声音再次响起，"我们……我们也告诉了美里小姐。"

"Oh... Good..." I reply nervously, I know I asked them to tell Misato but it doesn't exactly make me feel good, "How did she take the news?"  
"哦……那就好……" 我紧张地回答，我知道我让他们告诉美里，但这并没有让我感觉好受，"她听到消息后反应如何？"

_"She was a bit mad at Rei... for lying about the reason she first went to Germany but she seemed relieved I guess. She was really worried about you when you left the first time..."  
"她对绫波有点生气……因为她最初去德国的理由撒了谎，但她似乎松了一口气。你第一次离开时，她真的很担心你……"_

"I know..." I sigh and shake my head, "Did she say anything else?"  
"我知道..." 我叹了口气，摇摇头，"她还说了别的什么吗？"

_"Not really, she spoke to Rei for a while about it but I don't know what they spoke about. She said she'll contact you when she can though. She's just... really busy at the moment."  
"没说什么，她和丽谈了一会儿，但我不清楚她们谈了什么。她说她一有空就会联系你。她现在...真的很忙。"_

"Yeah, Rei mentioned something about that. Tokyo-3 stuff, right?"  
"是啊，丽提到过。东京-3 的事，对吧？"

_"Yeah..."_ He replies, _"She comes home late a lot, she feels really bad about it too but we tell her to not worry about it. Oh... I listened to those tracks last night!"_  
"嗯..." 他回答道，"她经常很晚回家，她也觉得很抱歉，但我们告诉她别担心。哦... 我昨晚听了那些曲子！"

"Ah, did you?" My ears prick up on hearing him say that, "What did you think?"  
"哦，是吗？" 听到他这么说，我的耳朵竖了起来，"你觉得怎么样？"

_"I liked them!"_ He answers with some enthusiasm, _"I can see why he picked those ones, I can imagine where strings might fit in but a few will be challenging. I'm... excited to try them though."_  
"我喜欢它们！" 他带着些许热情回答，"我能理解他为什么选这些，我能想象到弦乐可能加入的地方，但有些会很有挑战性。我... 很期待尝试一下。"

I grin, embracing a challenge? This is a side of Shinji I haven't seen before, or at least very rarely seen, "Did any of them stand out to you?"  
我咧嘴一笑，迎接挑战？这是我不常见到的真嗣的一面，或者至少很少见到，“有没有哪一首让你印象特别深刻？”

_"Umm... Well that one by Meat Loaf definitely stood out but I really liked the tracks by Genesis and Procal Harum too. A few of them were very... different to what I'd normally listen to."  
“嗯……那个，Meat Loaf 的那首确实很突出，但我也很喜欢 Genesis 和 Procol Harum 的曲目。有几首非常……和我平时听的风格很不一样。”_

I find myself intrigued as he says that, "What do you normally listen to anyway?"  
他这么说让我感到好奇，“那你平时都听些什么呢？”

It takes him a moment to reply, _"Well... a few things really, mostly classical stuff because of my teacher but there are a few modern songs I like. I've got a few songs on there too that were... they were left on the SDAT when I first got it, I think they're what my mother used to listen to."_  
他过了一会儿才回答，“嗯……其实有好几首，主要是古典音乐，因为我的老师喜欢，但也有几首现代歌曲我很喜欢。我那台 SDAT 里也有几首歌……是我第一次拿到它时就已经在里面的，我想那是我母亲以前听的。”

"Ah I see..." I say and lower my gaze unsure of what to say to him. Mothers are, as are many things, a delicate subject, "I didn't realize it was her SDAT when you had it?"  
“啊，我明白了……”我低声说道，目光下垂，不知道该对他说些什么。母亲，就像许多事情一样，是一个敏感的话题，“我之前不知道那是她的 SDAT？”

_"Yeah... It was the only thing of hers that remained after my father destroyed everything."_ He pauses, _"I later found out that it was Fuyutsuki who saved it, he sent it to my teacher saying that my mother would want me to have it."_  
“是啊……那是我父亲毁掉一切后，唯一留下的属于她的东西。”他顿了顿，“后来我才知道是冬月救了它，他把它寄给了我的老师，说母亲会希望我拥有它。”

"That was good of him."  
“他真是好心。”

Music left to us by our mothers, yet another thing that links the two of us. Sometimes it wouldn't surprise me if I found out our mothers were best of friends before they both died. Heh, maybe they were, it's not like I've asked anyone.  
我们母亲留下的音乐，又一件将我们两人联系在一起的东西。有时我甚至觉得，如果发现她们在去世前是最好的朋友，我也不会感到惊讶。呵呵，也许她们真的是，只是我从没问过任何人。

I glance down at the laptop screen, "Well I went through and found some of those tracks for you last night. They finished uploading a while ago so when we're done here I'll send the link over if you want!"  
我低头看向笔记本电脑屏幕，“昨晚我帮你找了一些那些曲目。它们已经上传完毕一段时间了，所以等我们这里结束后，如果你想要的话，我会把链接发给你！”

_"Really? That'd be great Asuka, thank you so much, I don't know how to repay you."  
"真的吗？那太好了，明日香，非常感谢你，我不知道该如何报答你。"_

"You don't need to repay me you idiot, consider this part of the apology for... well what I did and what happened between you and Rei." I reply.  
""你不需要报答我，傻瓜，就当这是对...嗯，我做的事以及你和丽之间发生的事情的道歉的一部分吧。"" 我回答道。

_"You don't need to apologize Asuka, I should be the one who..."  
"你不必道歉，明日香，我才是应该道歉的那个人..."_

I cut him off immediately, "No! Don't you dare apologize, I already told you... None of this was your fault."  
我立刻打断他，“不！你敢道歉试试，我已经告诉过你……这些都不是你的错。”

_"I know but..."_ He resists  
“我知道但是……”他挣扎着说

I stop him once again, "No!"  
我再次阻止他，“不行！”

Once more he protests, _"But..."_  
他又抗议道，“但是……”

"Shinji!" I almost growl.  
“真嗣！”我几乎要咆哮起来。

_"Sorry..." “对不起……”_

He still managed to find a way to apologize! He's frustrating, impossibly so yet despite how much this annoys me I can't help but grin at it. It irritates me and yet I missed it, I missed those little exchanges because they were in some strange way funny and I get the feeling he's smiling on the other end of the phone as well.  
他还是设法找到了道歉的方式！他真是让人抓狂，难以置信地让人恼火，尽管这让我很烦，但我还是忍不住笑了。这让我恼火，但我却想念它，我怀念那些小小的交流，因为它们在某种奇怪的方式下很有趣，我感觉到他在电话那头也在微笑。

_"Oh, you said you wanted two tickets for the concert, didn't you?"_ He suddenly asks, _"Did you want me to ask Hikari for you?"_  
“哦，你说过你想买两张演唱会的票，对吧？”他突然问道，“需要我帮你问一下光吗？”

Hikari? Why would he... Oh, I said last night tickets for me and a friend, didn't I? He must have assumed I meant Hikari after all if I was back in touch with them why wouldn't I also get back in touch with Hikari. In truth I hadn't considered it just yet, I was intending to eventually but just not yet. One step at a time I suppose.  
光？他为什么会……哦，我昨晚说要给我和一位朋友买票，对吧？他一定是以为我指的是光，毕竟既然我和他们重新联系上了，为什么不也和光联系呢。实际上我还没考虑过这个问题，我打算迟些时候再联系，但不是现在。一步一步来吧。

"Oh... No, it... wasn't Hikari." I reply to him and figure out the best way to go about this, I was intending to tell him about Kaworu, just not exactly like this. I take in a deep breath and wonder just how he is going to react to this. Rei said he reacted fairly badly to the news that Kaworu was alive, that was weeks ago, though. Surely, he'd be better now... right?  
"哦...不，它...不是光。" 我回答他，并想出最好的方式来处理这件事，我本打算告诉他关于薰的事，只是没想到会这样突然。我深吸一口气，想知道他会如何反应。丽说过他对薰还活着的消息反应相当糟糕，那已经是几周前的事了。不过，现在他应该好些了吧...对吧？

_'You know that isn't how this works Asuka...'_ I hear a voice in the back of my head remind me. Yeah... I'm aware of how this sort of thing works. Trauma doesn't go away quickly, if it ever goes away at all.  
'你知道这不是这么运作的，明日香...' 我脑海中有个声音提醒我。是啊...我知道这种事情的运作方式。创伤不会很快消失，如果它真的会消失的话。

_"Oh... It's a friend from Germany then?"_ He asks.  
"哦...那是德国的朋友吗？" 他问道。

"Yeah..." I trail off, "Look... this isn't the easiest thing to say Shinji so I want you to prepare yourself."  
“嗯……”我顿了顿，“听着……这事儿不太好开口，真嗣，你得做好心理准备。”

_"Okay..."_ He sounds confused.  
“好吧……”他听起来有些困惑。

"So, this friend is..." I trail off again, this is so damn hard, "Shinji, do you remember that thing Rei told you a few weeks ago? About... a certain person returning?"  
“那么，这个朋友是……”我又一次停了下来，这真是太难了，“真嗣，你还记得几周前绫波跟你说的那件事吗？关于……某个人回来的事？”

_"Y-Yeah..."_ I can hear the trembling in his voice as he speaks, as much as I like to call him an idiot I know Shinji isn't that stupid, he must be starting to make the connection, _"K-Kaworu was back..."_  
"嗯...嗯..."" 我能听到他说话时声音中的颤抖，尽管我总喜欢叫他傻瓜，但我知道真嗣并不那么愚蠢，他肯定开始意识到其中的联系了，""K-Kaworu 回来了..."

"Yeah... That's my friend... Kaworu... Kaworu Nagisa is... my friend."  
"是的...那是我的朋友... Kaworu... Kaworu 渚是我的朋友。"

I feel sick, my heart is thumping in my chest and my legs are shaking and yet I know that how I feel right now, it's probably nothing compared to what Shinji is feeling. In fact, despite the distance I am sure I can hear the sound of something breaking.  
我感觉恶心，心脏在胸腔里狂跳，双腿颤抖，然而我知道我现在的心情，可能与真嗣所感受到的相比根本不算什么。事实上，尽管相隔甚远，我确信我能听到某种东西破碎的声音。

_"I... I have to go..."  
"我...我得走了..."_

"Wait!" I almost yell, "Wait Shinji... Please... Please don't hang up, don't you dare hang up on me."  
"等等！" 我几乎喊了出来，"等一下，真嗣...求你了...请不要挂电话，你敢挂我电话试试看。"

_"No, I can't do this. Goodby-"  
"不，我做不到。再见了-"_

"Shinji, if you hang up that phone I swear to god I will be in Japan tomorrow and tell you about this face to face!" I reply to him sternly, "Let me... Let me explain everything, just... hear me out okay? If you don't want to talk to me after this then... I understand but just... let me explain."  
"真嗣，你要是敢挂电话，我发誓明天就飞到日本，当面跟你解释这一切！" 我严肃地回应他，"让我...让我解释清楚，就...听我说完好吗？如果你听完不想跟我说话了...我理解，但至少...让我解释。"

There is silence from his end of the phone and I do actually expect him to hang up. I wouldn't blame him if he did to be honest. That was probably the last person he ever expected me to mention and after all that happened yesterday he's probably been upset enough. Damnit my stomach is churning, I'm glad I haven't had breakfast yet.  
电话那头一片寂静，我甚至以为他会挂断。说实话，如果他真的挂了，我也不会怪他。那可能是他最意想不到我会提到的人，而且经历了昨天的事，他肯定已经够难过了。该死，我的胃在翻腾，幸好还没吃早餐。

It's a minute before I hear anything again, _"O-Okay… I… I'll stay, sorry."_  
过了一分钟，我才再次听到他的声音，"好...好吧…我...我会留下，对不起。"

"No, don't be sorry." I tell him. How can he still be sorry for wanting to leave when I bring up Kaworu? Okay I guess maybe I didn't help matters with my warning, "Don't be sorry at all, I… probably shouldn't have mentioned him yet but I thought you should know sooner rather than later."  
"不，别道歉。" 我告诉他。当我提到渚薰时，他怎么还想为离开而道歉呢？好吧，也许我的警告没有帮上忙，"真的不用道歉，我……可能不该这么早提他，但我想你应该早点知道。"

_"I don't understand, I mean… how?"  
"我不明白，我是说……怎么回事？"_

His voice is trembling still but at least he is staying on the phone, "I bumped into him coming out of a café here in Germany… Literally bumped into him, he dropped a letter and ran off when he saw me."  
他的声音仍在颤抖，但至少他还留在电话旁，"我在德国的一家咖啡馆外撞见了他……字面意义上的撞见，他看到我后掉了一封信就跑掉了。"

_"He ran away?"_ Shinji asks me, _"Why?"_  
"他跑掉了？" 真嗣问我，"为什么？"

"He recognized me, thought I'd hurt him. I didn't have a clue who he was, thought he was some idiot who didn't bother to look where he was going." I laugh, "Being honest I thought he was someone who recognized me, I thought that my life on anonymity had finally ran out."  
"他认出了我，以为我会伤害他。我根本不知道他是谁，以为他就是个不看路的傻瓜。" 我笑了笑，"说实话，我当时以为他也是认出了我，以为我那隐姓埋名的生活终于到头了。"

_"You didn't recognize him?"  
"你没认出他来？"_

"No, I couldn't have done. I was in a coma when he arrived remember so I didn't know who he was or anything about it." I explain, "It was Rei who filled me in when I saw her the next day. She recognized his name and warned me against any contact with him."  
"不，我不可能知道。他来的时候我正处于昏迷状态，记得吗？所以我既不知道他是谁，也不了解任何相关情况。" 我解释道，"是丽在我第二天见到她时告诉我的。她认出了他的名字，并警告我不要与他有任何接触。"

_"You still went to see him?"_ He exclaims in surprise.  
"你还是去见了他？" 他惊讶地喊道。"

"When have I ever listened to people?" I ask him with a smile, "I was… curious I guess. She told me about this dangerous person who used to be an Angel yet my experience had been the opposite. I guess I wanted to know why he ran away from me. When I got to his apartment he… well he was terrified of me."  
"我什么时候听过别人的话？" 我笑着问他，"我想我是好奇吧。她告诉我这个曾经是天使的危险人物，但我的经历却截然相反。我想知道他为什么从我身边逃走。当我到达他的公寓时，他……嗯，他对我非常害怕。"

_"Why?" “为什么？”_

"Because he's human Shinji and he thinks everything is going to hurt him." I explain, "He knew who I was and thought I was there for revenge for what he had done… I guess I felt sorry for him. I know how that feels."  
“因为他只是个人类，真嗣，他认为所有事情都会伤害他。”我解释道，“他知道我是谁，以为我是为了报复他过去所做的事……我想我是同情他吧。我知道那种感觉。”

_"Yeah… I do too…"_ Shinji says solemnly, _"But we didn't do what he did Asuka!"_  
“是啊……我也是……”真嗣严肃地说，“但我们没有做他做的那些事，明日香！”

"I know Shinji, I know what he nearly did and I know what he was. Rei reminded me of that when I told her about this, she wasn't… happy about it either." I explain to him.  
"我知道真嗣，我知道他差点做了什么，也知道他曾经是什么样的人。当我告诉绫波这件事时，她提醒了我，她对此也不太高兴。" 我向他解释道。

_"Rei knows about it?"_ Shinji asks.  
"绫波知道这件事？" 真嗣问道。

"Yes she does, I had to tell her and she wasn't happy about it. She… understandably doesn't trust Kaworu and she also wants to protect you." I say to Shinji, "She was worried that it'd be some trick by Kaworu but… well it isn't."  
"是的，她知道。我不得不告诉她，她对此并不高兴。她……可以理解地不信任薰，她也想保护你。" 我对真嗣说，"她担心这是薰的某种诡计，但……其实并不是。"

"_How do you know? It still could be!"_ Shinji raises his voice to me which I find somewhat surprising.  
"你怎么知道？它还可能是！" 真嗣对我提高了声音，这让我有些惊讶。

"Because he was attacked Shinji, not long after he came back the people assigned to watch him attacked him and beat him up." I tell him, "They recognized him from NERV and they hurt him, I was… there for him. He was helpless."  
"因为他被袭击了，真嗣，他回来后不久，被指派监视他的人袭击了他，把他打了一顿。" 我告诉他，"他们从 NERV 认出了他，他们伤害了他，我当时…在他身边。他无助极了。"

_"Oh… I… Was he hurt?"  
"哦…我…他受伤了吗？"_

"Nothing too bad physically, busted lip and black eye. He recovered quickly but it hurt his confidence and pride I guess." I shrug, "Look… This isn't my story to tell but Kaworu's past… SEELE made him do those things and he's a victim too. I don't blame you for hating him or not trusting him but… I'd like for you and Rei to give him a chance."  
"身体上没什么大碍，就是嘴唇破了，眼睛也肿了。他恢复得很快，但我想这伤了他的自信和自尊。" 我耸耸肩，"听着……这不是我该讲的故事，但碇真嗣的过去……SEELE 逼他做了那些事，他也是受害者。我不怪你恨他或不信任他，但……我希望你和绫波能给他一个机会。""

There is a long pause and I know Shinji is struggling to figure out what to say. This isn't going to be easy for him but I need to get this out of the way now, if I don't then it's just going to build up and up and besides… if I can get those two talking to each other I can make them both happy right?  
沉默良久，我知道真嗣正在努力思考该说什么。这对他来说并不容易，但我现在必须把这件事说清楚，如果不这么做，问题只会越积越多，而且……如果我能让他们俩开始交流，我就能让他们都开心，对吧？

_"Okay I…"_ Shinji trails off, _"I'll… He can come and… I'd like to speak to him sometime if that's possible? I… I'd like to know his story."_  
"好吧，我……" 真嗣犹豫了一下，"我会……他可以来……如果可能的话，我想找个时间和他谈谈。我……我想听听他的故事。""

"Okay, good." I nod my head, "Thank you Shinji, I'll speak to him."  
"好的，很好。" 我点点头，"谢谢你，真嗣，我会和他谈谈。"

_"Okay and… thank you for telling me, you're right it is better I hear it now."  
"好的，还有……谢谢你告诉我，你说得对，现在听到总比晚些好。"_

"I know… Let's… forget about that for now. I want to hear more of your thoughts on those songs and tell you a bit more about the tracks I've picked."  
"我知道……让我们……暂时忘掉那件事吧。我想多听听你对那些歌曲的想法，也跟你分享一下我挑选的曲目。"

With those words we carry on speaking to one another and put the awkward part of the conversation behind us. He tells me what his favourite songs were and I tell him which ones are my favourites and even about the bands behind them. He sounds surprised to hear me talk about music in such a way, I guess when I was around I never really shown much enthusiasm for the subject.  
说完这些话，我们继续交谈，将尴尬的部分抛诸脑后。他告诉我他最喜欢的歌曲，我则向他介绍我最喜欢的曲目，甚至包括背后的乐队。他似乎对我如此谈论音乐感到惊讶，我想在我身边时，我从未真正表现出对这一话题的热情。

On the other side though hearing Shinji tell me about what he likes and playing the cello, it's like I'm talking to a different Shinji. He sounds enthusiastic, confident and happy, a far cry from the nervous and timid boy I used to know. We speak for another half an hour or so and then Shinji tells me he has to go, Rei is due in and I need to go and eat and get my stuff from my apartment.  
另一方面，听着真嗣谈论他喜欢的事物和拉大提琴，感觉就像在与一个不同的真嗣交谈。他听起来热情洋溢、自信满满且快乐无比，与过去那个紧张胆怯的男孩判若两人。我们又聊了大约半小时，然后真嗣告诉我他得走了，绫波快到了，我也需要去吃饭并从公寓取回我的东西。

We hang up and say we'll talk again soon. He also says that he'll send a recording of himself playing the Cello later. I'm sure me and Kaworu will enjoy cuddling up and listening to it. After the phone call I sit for a moment thinking about what'll happen going forward. I'm back in contact with them, this is… a major change for me but one I think I want. I want to be happy, I deserve to be happy and so does Kaworu, maybe… maybe all of this can work.  
我们挂断电话，约定不久后再聊。他还说稍后会发一段自己拉大提琴的录音。我相信我和渚薰会喜欢依偎在一起聆听。通话结束后，我坐了一会儿，思考着未来的发展。我重新与他们联系上了，这对我是……一个重大的转变，但我想这是我想要的。我想快乐，我值得快乐，渚薰也一样，也许……也许这一切都能行得通。

### Chapter 12: Sound Of Contact  
第十二章：接触之声  

**23rd September 2021 – Kaworu Nagisa  
2021 年 9 月 23 日 – 渚薰**

I leave the practice building completely aware that I am smiling. Today has been an experience that I do not think I will forget about any time soon. The day has brought with it a mixture of feelings and emotions, at the start I was terrified and so very nervous. As the day went on that fear gave way to moments of frustration but also elation and joy.  
我带着满面的笑容离开了练习楼。今天是一次难忘的经历，我想我不会很快忘记。这一天带来了各种情感和情绪，起初我感到恐惧和极度紧张。随着时间的推移，恐惧让位于挫折感，但也有兴奋和喜悦的时刻。

I cannot think of a name for what I am feeling now, I feel that to give it a name would mar it. Suffice to say I feel like a part of me has been reborn on this very day. I feel like parts of me have been awakened that I never knew existed.  
此刻的心情，我竟难以名状，总觉得一旦赋予其名称，便会玷污了这份纯粹。只能说，今日我仿佛重获新生，那些沉睡的自我，连我自己都未曾察觉的部分，已然苏醒。

I glance down at my hands as I walk. In all the years I have played the piano I never realized what I really had with these hands. I never fully understood the power that these hands could have. I have the power to inspire someone, I have the power to teach someone, I have the ability to put a smile on someone's face.  
我边走边低头看向自己的双手。多年来弹奏钢琴，我从未真正意识到这双手所拥有的力量。我未曾完全理解这双手能发挥多大的能量。我有能力鼓舞他人，有能力传授知识，有能力为他人带来笑容。

Today was my first day of teaching piano to others. I have given four lessons in total today to a variety of people. Two of which were complete beginners, one was a young child and the other was an adult who was double my own age. The other two students were fairly experienced but were looking for help and assistance in moving forward with their own playing.  
今天是我第一次教别人弹钢琴。总共上了四节课，对象各异。其中两位是完完全全的初学者，一个是小孩，另一个则是比我年长一倍的成年人。另外两位学生已有相当经验，但他们寻求帮助，希望能进一步提升自己的演奏水平。

Today I... I have helped people. I feel such elation in knowing that I, Kaworu Nagisa, can actually make a positive contribution to this world. When I am home I must be sure to contact Fuyutsuki, I must thank him for giving me this chance and tell him how the day has gone. Afterwards I... I shall see Asuka and I will take her out to dinner to celebrate.  
今天我……我帮助了人们。得知我，渚薰，能够为这个世界做出积极的贡献，我感到无比的喜悦。回家后，我必须联系冬月，感谢他给我这个机会，并告诉他今天的情况。之后我……我会去找明日香，带她出去吃饭庆祝。

I must admit that I was quite unsure as to whether or not I would be able to get through today. Acquiring the relevant qualifications and certifications to do this was fairly simple but actually having to do this was a different matter. I feel like I must have read the documentation and advice a million and one times. Yet I still did not feel that I was prepared.  
我必须承认，对于今天能否顺利度过，我相当不确定。获取相关的资格和证书相当简单，但实际去做却是另一回事。我感觉自己一定已经读了无数遍的文件和建议。然而，我仍然觉得没有准备好。

To tell the truth I felt like an imposter, when I think about what I am and what I was. I am still learning how to be human so how can I teach people something that is the pinnacle of human achievement. I felt that I had no right to do such a thing. I felt that because I am an alien, because I am not human that I was intruding on something that was rightfully theirs.  
说实话，我感觉自己像个冒牌货，当我思考我是谁，我曾经是什么。我仍在学习如何成为人类，那么我怎么可能教导人们达到人类成就的顶峰呢？我觉得我没有权利做这样的事。我觉得因为我是外星人，因为我不是人类，我是在侵犯本应属于他们的东西。

I told all of this to Asuka last night, in return she called me an idiot and hit me with a pillow. She told me that I was a wonderful piano player and that I'd do fine. She said that I had as much of a right to teach piano as anyone else in this world and to not think of myself as an alien any longer. She then called me an idiot again before throwing a pillow at me and asking if I wanted to share some ice cream with her.  
昨晚我把这一切都告诉了明日香，作为回应，她骂我傻瓜并用枕头砸了我。她告诉我，我是个出色的钢琴演奏者，一切都会顺利的。她说，我有权利像世界上任何人一样教授钢琴，不再把自己当成异类。然后她又骂了我一声傻瓜，扔了个枕头过来，问我是否想和她一起吃冰淇淋。

Beyond the concerns about my own identity there was something else bugging me. I did not feel that I would be able to teach my students. Whilst I am confident in my own abilities as a musician I wondered if those abilities would translate well into teaching. I was worried that perhaps I would be unable to keep their attention for an entire lesson, or perhaps I would be uninteresting and they would learn nothing from me.  
除了对自己身份的担忧，还有其他事情困扰着我。我不觉得自己能教好学生。虽然我对自己的音乐能力充满信心，但我不确定这些能力是否能很好地转化为教学。我担心可能无法让他们的注意力集中整节课，或者我可能很无趣，他们从我这里学不到东西。

There was also that familiar fear in the back of my mind that perhaps one of them would recognize me. I know it is unlikely that anyone would recognize me. Asuka has told me that a number of times and I have been out myself often enough to know it is unlikely to happen. Yet the thoughts of what happened to me only a few weeks ago are still fresh in my mind.  
心中依然萦绕着那熟悉的恐惧，担心他们中或许有人会认出我。我知道这种可能性微乎其微。明日香多次告诉我这一点，我自己也经常外出，足以明白这不太可能发生。然而，仅仅几周前发生在我身上的事情，至今仍历历在目。

It would seem that all of my fears and concerns were in vain though. All four of the lessons seemed to go extremely well. For the two who wanted to advance with their playing I took the time to listen to them play and identify areas that I thought they could improve in. In both cases they had the fundamentals of playing down but felt there was something of a wall in place preventing them from moving forward.  
然而，这一切恐惧和担忧似乎都是多余的。四节课看起来都进行得非常顺利。对于那两位希望提高演奏水平的学生，我花时间聆听他们的演奏，并指出我认为他们可以改进的地方。两人都掌握了演奏的基本功，但感觉有一堵墙挡在面前，阻碍他们前进。

So I listened to them. For one of them I thought that whilst he could identify and play a few pieces his timing was off in a few areas. I asked if he played to a metronome and he told me they didn't, they went off of what sounded right. So I had him play the pieces again but this time to a metronome and also put him through some basic exercises to get him used to playing with that.  
于是我聆听了他们的演奏。其中一人，我认为他虽然能识别并演奏几首曲子，但在某些地方节奏把握不准。我问他是否使用节拍器，他告诉我他们没有，只是凭感觉来。于是我让他再次演奏这些曲子，但这次要跟着节拍器，并让他做一些基础练习，让他习惯这样演奏。

For the other person she had her timing down and was used to playing with a metronome but wanted to move onto some more advanced pieces. Her difficulty was that she found herself intimidated by the pieces she wanted to learn and wasn't sure where to really start. She brought in a piece for us to work through, over the next few lessons I'm going to try breaking it down for her, identify techniques used and show her how to put it all together. My hope is that she can apply those methods to learn other pieces she wishes to learn.  
对于另一个人，她已经掌握了节奏，习惯于跟着节拍器练习，但想要尝试一些更高级的曲目。她的困难在于，她发现自己被想要学习的曲目所吓倒，不确定从哪里真正开始。她带来了一首曲子让我们一起攻克，接下来的几节课，我打算尝试为她分解这首曲子，识别其中使用的技术，并展示她如何将所有部分组合起来。我希望她能将这些方法应用到学习其他她希望学习的曲目中。

The adult twice my age was a complete beginner. He had always wanted to learn to play an instrument but never really made that leap into doing so. He had received a keyboard as a birthday present from his wife and so was looking for lessons on getting started. For him I introduced him to the keys, showed him what each one was and even managed to get him to switch between two chords.  
这位年龄比我大一倍的成年人完全是个初学者。他一直想学习演奏乐器，但从未真正迈出那一步。他收到了妻子送的键盘作为生日礼物，因此正在寻找入门课程。对于他，我介绍了键盘上的每个键，展示了它们各自的功能，甚至成功地教会了他如何在两个和弦之间切换。

It was the child that concerned me the most though as I went into today's sessions. I had a number of questions going into the lesson. First I wondered if I would be able to handle a six-year old child. I had never even met a child before; my only experiences of young children comes from seeing them in film or television, or seeing them out in the streets and those situations did not always seem to be good.  
然而，进入今天的课程时，最让我担忧的是那个孩子。在上课前，我心中有许多疑问。首先，我怀疑自己是否能应付一个六岁的孩子。我从未真正接触过儿童；我对幼儿的唯一了解来自电影、电视中看到的，或是在街上偶遇的情景，而这些情况并不总是令人愉快。

I admit that I was also worried about the child itself. I questioned whether a child of that age would really want to learn how to play the piano. I questioned whether this was a decision made by them or made by their parents. Perhaps I should not be asking such questions or having such worried but based on my own past experiences I was unable to not have these concerns. It was at age six that my handlers forced the piano onto me.  
我承认，我对孩子本身也感到担忧。我怀疑这么小的孩子是否真的想学钢琴。我不确定这是他们自己的决定，还是父母的安排。也许我不该问这些问题，也不该如此忧虑，但基于我过去的经历，我无法不产生这些顾虑。正是在六岁那年，我的监护人强迫我学习钢琴。

So yes, I was very worried, it was not my desire or wish to teach this art to a person who does not wish to learn or is being coerced into doing so. Music is a gift to be enjoyed and shared, it is not a competition or something to give a person status. Music is about expression what is within the heart, be it a simplistic melody or a complex symphony. I want to help inspire people, I do not wish for them to suffer.  
所以没错，我非常担心，并不希望将这门艺术传授给那些不愿学习或被迫如此的人。音乐是一种享受和分享的礼物，它不是竞争或提升地位的工具。音乐是表达内心情感的方式，无论是简单的旋律还是复杂的交响乐。我希望能够启发人们，而不是让他们受苦。

Fortunately, it seems like all of my worried regarding the child were unfounded. The child himself was a very pleasant young man, he was both attentive and polite. His mother was in the room with us the whole time which made me feel a bit more comfortable.  
幸运的是，看来我对这个孩子的所有担忧都是多余的。他本人是一个非常愉快的小伙子，既专注又有礼貌。他的母亲全程都在房间里，这让我感觉更放心了一些。

I actually spoke to her about the child's reasons for playing. It turns out the child's school had someone come in to play and he decided he wanted to do that too. She was reluctant at first saying that it was expensive and the child might not even keep it up but she decided to encourage it.  
我实际上和她谈到了孩子学琴的原因。原来孩子的学校有人来表演，他因此决定自己也想这么做。她起初有些犹豫，说这很昂贵，孩子可能坚持不下去，但她最终决定支持他。

In the end I am pleased that she has done so. Her son seemed to be very happy with what we were able to accomplish. We went through less than the other beginner, I tried to teach him the location of a few notes and had him play them in order. I gave him a sheet to take home so he can practice this on his own keyboard. Next week I'll continue with that and try to teach him a basic tune and his first two chords.  
最终，我对她的所作所为感到满意。她的儿子似乎对我们所取得的成就非常高兴。我们比其他初学者经历的少，我试着教他几个音符的位置，并让他按顺序弹奏。我给了他一张纸带回家，这样他就可以在自己的键盘上练习了。下周我将继续这样做，并尝试教他一首基本的曲子和他的前两个和弦。

When teaching him I'll be sure to take it slowly unlike the ones that taught me. Beethoven and Mozart are going to be far away for this young man. We can start simple and build up. I want to make sure his child enjoys playing and has a smile on his face when he leaves here.  
在教他的时候，我会确保慢慢来，不像那些教我的人。对于这个年轻人来说，贝多芬和莫扎特还很遥远。我们可以从简单开始，逐步提升。我想确保他的孩子喜欢弹奏，并且离开这里时脸上带着微笑。

Now however it is I who has a smile on my face. I am now returning home, to my home where Asuka, my girlfriend is currently staying. It feels weird to think such a thing, nine months ago I was coming to terms with the fact that I was alive. Barely a month later I had to get used to living on my own, cooking and shopping for myself and learning how to work for a living. Thought of romance were naught but a dream, I never expected such a thing to occur.  
然而现在，是我自己脸上带着微笑。我现在正回家，回到有我女朋友明日香在的家。想到这样的事情感觉很奇怪，九个月前我还在接受自己还活着的事实。不到一个月后，我不得不习惯独自生活，自己做饭、购物，并学习如何为生计工作。浪漫的想法不过是梦想，我从未期望这样的事情会发生。

Fate it seems had other plans, it led me to bump into Asuka, quite literally bump into her. I can still remember feeling so much fear upon seeing her. I was so certain that she would recognize me and hate me for what I am and what I was. Yet that did not happen, she did not recognize me and even when she knew who I was she did not hate me.  
命运似乎另有安排，它让我与明日香撞了个满怀，真的是字面意义上的撞到她。我至今仍记得见到她时那种深深的恐惧。我确信她会认出我，并因我是谁、我曾经是谁而恨我。然而这一切并未发生，她没有认出我，即使后来知道我是谁，她也没有恨我。

From there a friendship blossomed between us. We laughed together, played games and listened to music. Eventually it developed into what it is now, something more than friendship, is it love? I am sure that what I feel for her qualifies. My heart leaps to think about her, I smile when I'm around her and I always long to be by her side. She is beautiful and she makes me so very happy. I am sure that this thing is love and I am so glad to be in it.  
从那时起，我们之间萌生了友谊。我们一起欢笑，玩游戏，听音乐。最终，它发展成了现在这样，超越了友谊的东西，这是爱吗？我确信我对她的感情足以称得上是爱。想到她，我的心就会跳动，我在她身边时会微笑，我总是渴望陪伴在她身旁。她美丽动人，她让我感到无比幸福。我确信这就是爱，我非常高兴能拥有它。

**Tokyo-2 – Shinji Ikari 东京-2 – 碇真嗣**

I step out of the reception and onto the street into the bright sunshine. I give my eyes a moment to adjust before looking around for any sign of Touji and Kensuke. As expected the two of them aren't here yet and seem to be running late. Usually something like that would annoy me but today I don't mind, it gives me a bit more time to figure out what I'm going to say to them. I've decided that today I'm going to tell them about being back in contact with Asuka.  
我走出接待室，踏上街道，沐浴在明媚的阳光下。我让眼睛适应了一会儿，才开始四处寻找冬二和真希波的踪影。不出所料，他们俩还没到，似乎迟到了。通常这种情况会让我恼火，但今天我并不介意，这给了我更多时间来思考该对他们说什么。我决定今天告诉他们我和明日香重新联系上了。

If I'm being honest I'm actually quite nervous about telling them. I guess it's because I don't really know how they're going to react to it. In the past the two of them have said some mean things about Asuka. I know they probably didn't mean it and most of it was a reaction to things she said to or about them but I do wonder how they'll feel about this.  
老实说，我其实相当紧张。我想是因为我不太确定他们会如何反应。过去，他们俩对明日香说过一些刻薄的话。我知道他们可能并非有意，大部分是对她说过或关于他们的话的反应，但我确实想知道他们对此会有何感受。

I'm happy that I'm able to be friends with her again and talking to her but will they be happy with it? I can still remember not too long after Asuka left Touji did actually tell me that it was probably for the best that she did leave. I never know if he was saying that just to make me feel better or if he actually meant that it was good that she left.  
我很高兴能再次与她成为朋友并交谈，但他们会为此感到高兴吗？我仍记得在明日香离开后不久，冬二确实告诉我，她离开可能是最好的结果。我始终不确定他这么说只是为了让我感觉好些，还是他真的认为她离开是件好事。

I don't think either of them really knows the full story about Asuka. They don't know the sort of things she went through that caused her to be the way she was. I know that doesn't justify her behavior at times but she dealt with things no one should ever have to deal with. Out of respect for Asuka I never told them about any of it. I figured that if she wanted anyone to know then she would tell them herself.  
我认为他们俩都不完全了解明日香的故事。他们不知道她经历了哪些事情，才变成了那样。我知道这并不能为她的某些行为开脱，但她所面对的事情是任何人都永远不应该经历的。出于对明日香的尊重，我从未向他们透露过任何细节。我想，如果她希望别人知道，她会亲自告诉他们的。

I spoke to Asuka again last night, during our conversation I actually asked if we should tell the others about her being back in contact. She said that she was fine with that, it was probably better to tell them now so that they can expect her in December. She did however tell me to keep her writing secret for now, not many people know about her pseudonym. So today I'll tell Touji and Kensuke and Rei will tell Hikari about it.  
昨晚我又和明日香聊了聊，在谈话中我实际上问过我们是否应该告诉其他人她重新联系上了。她说她对此没意见，现在告诉他们可能更好，这样他们十二月就能预见到她。不过，她确实让我暂时保密她的写作，知道她笔名的人并不多。所以今天我会告诉真治和剑介，而丽会告诉光。

I have to admit that speaking to Asuka again is strange. It's been so many years since I last saw or even spoke to her and yet it doesn't feel like any time has passed at all. It's also quite different speaking to her, she seems to be more open than she used to, I guess in a way I am too. We've both had years to work through the various issues we've had and whilst I don't think I am nor will I ever be completely through it I am in a better place now. I feel like Asuka is the same.  
我不得不承认，再次与明日香交谈感觉很奇怪。自从上次见到她或与她交谈已经过去了很多年，然而却感觉仿佛时间从未流逝。与她交谈也大不相同，她似乎比以前更加开放，我想在某种程度上我也是如此。我们都花了多年时间来解决各自的问题，虽然我不认为自己已经完全克服，也不会完全克服，但现在的我状态更好了。我觉得明日香也是如此。

It's nice though, because certain elements of the old Asuka remain but it's different now. She still has a boastful and confident side but it doesn't feel the same as it did before. She will even still call me an idiot when we speak but it's playful. I feel like this is how it always should have been and if things had been different back then it would have been too.  
不过这感觉很好，因为明日香的一些旧有特质依然存在，但现在不同了。她仍然有着自夸和自信的一面，但感觉与以前不同了。即使她在我们交谈时还会叫我笨蛋，但那是带着玩味的。我觉得这才是我们本应一直保持的状态，如果当时的情况不同，也许就会是这样。

Something that really stands out is I'm learning how passionate Asuka is about the things she likes. She was always so closed off back then. I suppose I was too. We'll discuss music for ages, we'll talk about who we like and why we like them. We've even started sending each other songs and discussing them. I'll ask her things about her book, I'll ask why she became a writer and what it was like to get her book published.  
最让我印象深刻的是，我了解到明日香对她喜欢的事物有多么热情。她以前总是那么封闭。我想我也是。我们会长时间讨论音乐，谈论我们喜欢谁以及为什么喜欢他们。我们甚至开始互相发送歌曲并讨论它们。我会问她关于她书的事情，问她为什么成为作家，以及出版她的书是什么感觉。

Asuka will ask me about my life here, she'll ask what I've been up to and all about my cello playing. She'll ask me how I started playing and why I decided to keep it up. She'll ask me about where we live now and about Rei and Misato. She'll ask me if I still cook and then I'll speak to her about the same subjects.  
明日香会问我在这里的生活，她会问我在忙什么，还有我拉大提琴的情况。她会问我为什么开始拉琴，以及为什么决定坚持下去。她会问我们现在的住处，还有关于丽和美里的事情。她会问我是否还在做饭，然后我会和她谈论同样的话题。

I feel like this is really how things should have been between us. From the moment I met her up until the day she left I always considered Asuka a close friend. On the day we met we were addressing each other by our first names and that just felt right. Even when things were at their very lowest for the two of us I never stopped seeing her as that close friend, I so desperately wanted to help but I couldn't.  
我觉得这才是我们之间应有的样子。从我遇见她的那一刻起，直到她离开的那天，我一直认为明日香是亲密的朋友。在我们相遇的那天，我们就直接用名字称呼对方，这感觉很自然。即使在我们最低谷的时候，我也从未停止将她视为那个亲密的朋友，我非常想帮助她，但我做不到。

I did always wonder how Asuka saw me. As first I thought she saw me purely as a rival and someone to compete against. Her addressing me by first name, I thought that was just a product of her being raised in a different environment but then why was I comfortable doing it too? As time went one I guess in figured out that she didn't just see me as a rival, she was my friend and didn't dislike me. She even pushed me to be better, I don't know if she did that intentionally but whenever I was around her I wanted to be better than I was.  
我一直好奇明日香是如何看待我的。起初，我以为她只把我当作竞争对手，一个需要与之较量的对象。她直呼我的名字，我原以为这只是因为她成长环境的差异，但为什么我也对此感到自在呢？随着时间的推移，我想我明白了，她不仅仅视我为对手，她还是我的朋友，并不讨厌我。她甚至激励我变得更好，我不知道她是否是有意为之，但每当我在她身边时，我就想超越自己。

Unfortunately, the peace of that time only lasted so long. I can't quite pinpoint the exact moment things started to go wrong. Was it the kiss? Was it something before then? Was it the twelfth Angel? It feels like it was around that time things started to go wrong and all I could do was look on as she and others around me started to fall apart.  
遗憾的是，那段平静的时光并没有持续太久。我无法确切指出事情开始出错的具体时刻。是因为那个吻吗？还是之前就发生了什么？是因为第十二使徒吗？感觉就是在那段时间，一切都开始出问题，而我只能眼睁睁看着她和其他身边的人逐渐崩溃。

I hate that I did absolutely nothing to help them. I hate that I merely stood by and watched it happen when a simple gesture could have helped any of them. What was I supposed to do though? I was terrified that people would hate me and abandon me, in truth I'm still terrified of that but I know now it isn't going to happen.  
我恨自己当时什么都没做去帮助他们。我恨自己只是袖手旁观，眼睁睁看着事情发生，其实一个简单的举动本可以帮到他们中的任何一个。可我又能做什么呢？我害怕人们会恨我、抛弃我，说实话我现在仍然害怕，但我知道那不会发生。

Yet I still hate myself for it all, I hate that I stood by and watched as Misato lost Kaji, I hate that I stood by and watched Asuka suffer the trauma of having her mind invaded by that Angel. I know that one simple gesture might have helped, a few words or even a hug. Yet I didn't do that, I stood by and watched from the shadows.  
然而我仍然为此痛恨自己，我恨自己站在一旁，看着美里失去了加持，我恨自己站在一旁，看着明日香遭受那个使徒侵入心灵的创伤。我知道一个简单的举动或许就能帮到他们，几句安慰或是一个拥抱。但我没有那么做，我只是站在阴影里旁观。

"Yo Shinji!" “哟，真嗣！”

I turn and look up towards the source of the voice that has very thankfully broken me free of my cycle of self-deprecation. At the end of the street I can see Touji and Kensuke walking towards me, I musted up a weak smile and wave at them with my free hand.  
我转身抬头望向那声音的来源，它非常及时地打断了我自我贬低的循环。在街道的尽头，我看到东治和真希波正朝我走来，我勉强挤出一个微笑，用空着的手向他们挥了挥。

"Hey guys!" “嘿，伙计们！”

They approach me and Touji flashes Kensuke a quick grin before pulling me into a crushing half-bear hug, "So what's up with you? You looked to be pretty deep in thought before we called out, didn't anyone ever tell ya that too much thinking is bad for you?"  
他们走近我，东治迅速向真希波露出一丝微笑，然后用力地给了我一个半熊抱，“最近怎么样？你刚才看起来陷入了深深的思考，没人告诉过你，想太多对你不好吗？”

"You know, they only say that because you're not capable of thinking Touji." Kensuke replies in a mocking tone.  
"你知道的，他们这么说只是因为你没有能力像我这样思考，东治。" 真嗣用一种嘲讽的语气回答道。

Touji thankfully let's go of me and glares at Kensuke, "Hey! What's that supposed to mean!"  
东治感激地放开了我，瞪着真嗣，"嘿！你这是什么意思！"

I laugh out loud as I Touji playfully punches Kensuke on the shoulder, "I'm just concerned about a friend!"  
我大笑着看东治开玩笑地捶了真嗣的肩膀，"我只是关心一个朋友！"

"Yeah I know." Kensuke laughs for a moment before turning towards me and looking slightly more concerned, "Seriously though Shinji, you did look pretty deep in thought."  
“是啊，我知道。” 真嗣笑了笑，随即转向我，神情略显关切，“不过说真的，真嗣，你看起来确实在深思什么。”

"I'm fine, I was just... having a moment. You know what I'm like." I half smile as the two of them look towards one another. More concern on their faces, it's amusing in its own way. Touji looks and gives off the image of being a stereotypical jock but, and not that he'd ever admit it, he has one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know and is very understanding.  
“我没事，只是……在想些事情。你知道我这人就这样。” 我半笑着，看着他们俩互相对视。他们脸上的担忧，倒也别有一番趣味。东治看上去像个典型的运动员，不过，他绝不会承认，他有一颗我认识的人中最大的心，而且非常善解人意。

Kensuke on the other hand, well... there were some issues in the past. For a while I didn't really want to face Kensuke due to his attitudes about me piloting. He's changed though, he's still a nerdy kid but he's more respectful and understands that piloting wasn't the cool experience he thought it was in his head.  
"至于真嗣，嗯……过去有些问题。有一段时间，我并不太想面对真嗣，因为他对我驾驶 EVA 的态度。不过他变了，虽然还是个书呆子，但他更尊重人了，也明白驾驶 EVA 并不像他想象中那么酷。”

Neither of them pries any further at the moment, instead Touji slaps me on the back, "Well, we're here now! Time to go and get food, I'm starving!"  
他们俩此刻都没有再追问下去，相反，冬二拍了拍我的背，“好了，我们到了！该去吃点东西了，我快饿死了！”

"You're always starving Touji!" Kensuke remarks, "Although that said, I could go for some food too, what do you say Shinji?"  
“你总是饿，冬二！” 真希说，“不过话说回来，我也挺想吃点东西的，你觉得呢，真嗣？”

My stomach growls in agreement with the two of them, "Yeah, I'm pretty hungry too."  
我的肚子咕噜咕噜地和他们俩的意见一致，“嗯，我也挺饿的。”

With that said we decide to go somewhere and get food. Touji has already scouted out places beforehand so knows exactly where to go. We walk along the pavement, Kensuke in the middle, Touji to his right and I'm on the left. I shift my cello case to my left hand to avoid hitting him with it as we walk. During the brief walk I look forward the two of them.  
话虽如此，我们决定去某个地方吃点东西。东治之前已经探过路了，所以知道确切的去处。我们沿着人行道走，真嗣在中间，东治在他右边，我在左边。我把大提琴盒换到左手，以免走路时撞到他。在短暂的步行中，我向前看着他们俩。

I've never really thought about it before but being in contact with Asuka again has gotten me to think about how we've all changed. I wonder how much Asuka has changed in the past few years too. We've all gotten a little bit taller and our body shapes and faces have changed slightly too. Touji has kept his hair short and the same as it always was but he's gotten a lot taller, standing above the two of us.  
我以前从未真正想过，但再次与明日香接触让我开始思考我们是如何改变的。我也想知道明日香在过去几年里改变了多少。我们都长高了一些，体型和脸也略有变化。东治一直保持着短发，和以前一样，但他长高了很多，站在我们俩之上。

Touji does a lot of sport and working out too. He wants to be a sports teacher so he always keeps himself fit and healthy. Basketball is or was his main sport, many people thought that he would be good enough to play at a professional level but he never really wanted to pursue that. He always felt that his prosthetic leg would cause issues and would rather work on inspiring others.  
东治经常运动和锻炼。他想成为一名体育老师，所以总是保持健康和健壮。篮球曾经是他的主要运动，很多人认为他有足够的实力在职业水平上打球，但他从未真正想追求这一点。他总是觉得他的假肢会带来问题，宁愿致力于激励他人。

Kensuke is the shortest out of the three of us. At the moment he has a few rough patches of facial hair where he is trying to grow something that resembles a beard. I don't think any of us have the heart to tell him that it isn't working.  
在我们三个当中，健介是最矮的。眼下，他脸上有些粗糙的胡茬，正试图长出类似胡须的东西。我想我们谁都不忍心告诉他，这并不成功。

I guess I've stayed mostly the same though. I wonder if Asuka would be disappointed by that or if it'd make her feel better? I've gotten a little bit taller but I still wear the same simplistic clothes, I still keep my hair the same length and I've remained the same build. The only thing I really have is a few shaving cuts on my cheek, unlike Kensuke and Touji I have no stubble or facial hair. I hate having it, it reminds me of him.  
我想我大部分还是老样子。不知这会让明日香失望还是感到安慰？我长高了一点，但依然穿着简约的衣服，头发保持同样长度，体型也没变。唯一不同的是我脸颊上有几处剃须划伤，不像健介和阿薰，我没有胡茬或面部毛发。我讨厌它们，它们让我想起他。

I wonder how much Asuka has changed in that time, does she still wear her hair in the same way? Has it gotten longer or short? What sort of clothes does she wear now? Has she gotten any taller and what about her body shape? I did consider asking for a picture or asking Rei but I backed out of it. I know it seems silly but I thought it might be too much to ask for that after we've only just started talking again.  
不知这段时间明日香变化了多少，她还是那样梳头发吗？头发变长还是短了？她现在穿什么样的衣服？她长高了吗，体型有变化吗？我曾考虑要张照片或问丽，但最终还是退缩了。我知道这听起来很傻，但我觉得在我们刚重新开始交谈时就提出这样的要求，可能太过分了。

We finally reach our destination, it's a small ramen place and for some reason I'm reminded of that small cart that we went to after defeating the tenth Angel. I had fun that night, it was nice to sit with the others and eat whilst enjoying the scenery. It was such a simple thing but it also meant so much.  
我们终于到达了目的地，这是一家小拉面馆，不知为何让我想起了击败第十使徒后去的那辆小推车。那晚我过得很愉快，与大家坐在一起边吃边欣赏风景，虽然简单却意义非凡。

Funnily enough that night was Asuka's idea as well. Misato had promised to take us all for a steak dinner after we fought the tenth Angel. Asuka found out two things, one was that Rei didn't eat meat and two was that Misato couldn't really afford such a thing. So, she took it upon herself to make sure we did something that Misato could afford and something that we could include Rei with.  
有趣的是，那晚也是明日香的主意。美里曾答应在我们击败第十使徒后带我们去吃牛排大餐。明日香发现了两件事，一是绫波不吃肉，二是美里其实负担不起这样的开销。于是，她决定亲自安排一些美里能负担得起、又能让绫波参与的活动。

It was always small things like that, the fact that she always tried to make sure people were included and always noticed if someone was unhappy that made me realize Asuka wasn't as bad as the image she presented. Things like that are why I considered her a close friend and fell for her. It's a shame that we didn't get to do more things like that.  
正是这些小事，她总是努力确保每个人都能参与，总是注意到谁不开心，让我意识到明日香并不像她表现出来的那么糟糕。正是这些细节让我把她视为亲密的朋友并爱上了她。遗憾的是，我们没能多做些这样的事情。

We all order what we want from the counter and find a quiet booth to sit down in. As we sit I realize I still haven't quite figured out what I'm going to tell them about Asuka. I spent all that time thinking about anything but that. I'm still worried about their reaction to the news. I don't want them to dislike or hate Asuka, she doesn't deserve that after all she has been through.  
我们从柜台各自点了自己想要的，然后找了个安静的卡座坐下。坐定后，我意识到我还没想好怎么跟他们说关于明日香的事。我花了那么多时间思考其他事情，唯独没想这个。我还是担心他们听到消息后的反应。我不希望他们因此不喜欢或讨厌明日香，她经历了那么多，不该再承受这些。

I know she wasn't always the nicest person to them though. It's not really fair though, they only saw one side of her. They never really saw the side I did. Hopefully they'll realize that.  
我知道她对他们的态度并不总是很好。但这并不公平，他们只看到了她的一面。他们从未真正看到我所见的那一面。希望他们能明白这一点。

"So, Shinji, how's it going with the cello stuff?" Kensuke asks me, distracting me from my thoughts.  
“那么，真嗣，你和大提琴的事进展如何？” 健介问我，打断了我的思绪。

"It's going good." I nod my head, "We've started to learn the songs for the concert now and it looks like I'll have to go to more rehearsal sessions a week now."  
"一切进展顺利。" 我点头说道，"我们现在已经开始学习音乐会的曲目了，看来我每周得参加更多的排练了。"

"Oh yeah?" Touji speaks up with a mouthful of food, "Hikari said she's looking forward to it. When is the concert?"  
"哦，是吗？" 冬二嘴里塞满食物说道，"光说她很期待。音乐会是什么时候？"

"Not until December." I tell Touji slightly unable to hide the surprise in my voice. I knew Rei and Misato were looking forward to it, as well as Asuka but I didn't think the others would have been that interested, "Is she planning on coming?"  
"要到十二月呢。" 我告诉冬二，声音中略带惊讶。我知道丽和美里都很期待，还有明日香，但我没想到其他人也会这么感兴趣，"她打算来吗？"

"We're all planning on coming!" Kensuke quickly corrects me, "You didn't think we'd miss something like this did you?"  
"我们都在计划来呢！" 健介迅速纠正我，"你不会以为我们会错过这样的事吧？"

I feel myself blush and shake my head, "N-No… Thank you… I appreciate it."  
我感到自己脸红了，摇了摇头，"不……谢谢你们……我很感激。"

I smile as I prod some of the noodles around in my bowl and give myself access to the half boiled egg in there. I balance it on my chopsticks for a moment before putting it into my mouth. So this means that everyone will be there on that night. My family and my friends, all of them will be there. Rei, Misato, Hikari, Touji, Kensuke and Asuka.  
我微笑着用筷子拨弄着碗里的面条，让自己能够吃到那半熟的鸡蛋。我把它夹在筷子上片刻，然后放入口中。这意味着那天晚上大家都会在那里。我的家人和朋友，他们都会在那里。丽、美里、光、透治、健介和明日香。

There is going to be another person there as well. I don't know if I can consider them a friend, I don't know what to consider them really. Asuka considers them a friend but is that really enough for me? Would that be enough for the others? They don't really know about Kaworu though, I've never really told them about what happened.  
那里还会有另一个人。我不知道是否能将他们视为朋友，我真的不知道该如何看待他们。明日香认为他们是朋友，但这对我来说真的足够吗？这对其他人来说足够吗？他们其实并不了解薰，我从未真正告诉过他们发生的事情。

I guess that is something I'll have to do if he is going to be there. I'll need to tell them exactly who Kaworu is. That can wait for now though, I need to tell them about Asuka first. I can't believe I spent all that time thinking about everything else other than what to say. I guess I'll just come out with it.  
我想如果他要来的话，这是我必须做的。我需要告诉他们薰到底是谁。不过这可以稍后再说，我首先需要告诉他们关于明日香的事情。我简直不敢相信我花了那么多时间思考其他事情，而不是该说什么。我想我会直接说出来。

"I… actually have something to tell you guys about the concert. I… I got a phone call from someone else who is going to be coming as well…"  
“我……其实有件事要告诉你们关于音乐会的。我……我接到另一个也会来的人的电话……”

Both of them look up at me in confusion, "Who?"  
他们俩困惑地抬头看向我，"谁？"

I take a deep breath, "Asuka…"  
我深吸一口气，"明日香…"

Both of them look at me in complete disbelief. I can see that they're trying to figure out if what they've just heard me say is actually what I've said. They exchange a glance between one another and then look at me once again. It takes about half a minute or so but Kensuke is the first one to speak.  
他们俩难以置信地看着我。我能看出他们正在努力确认刚才听到的话是否真是我说的。他们彼此交换了一个眼神，然后再次看向我。大约过了半分钟，健介率先开口。

"You mean… the red devil Asuka right?"  
"你是说…那个红色恶魔明日香吗？"

I nod my head, "Yes."  
我点点头，"是的。"

"Like… that… Asuka?" He asks again.  
"就像…那个…明日香？" 他又问了一遍。"

I nod once more, "Yes…"  
我再次点头，“是的…”

"Asuka is going to be there?" Touji exclaims, "I didn't know she played an instrument!"  
“明日香也会去吗？” 真嗣惊呼，“我之前都不知道她会乐器！”

I can hear the sound of Kensuke groaning next to me and I have the urge to do the same. I look to see Kensuke shaking his head, "Shinji didn't mean she was going to be playing in the concert! He meant she is actually going to be in audience!"  
我能听到旁边的健介在呻吟，我也忍不住想这么做。我看向健介，他摇着头说：“真嗣的意思是明日香会去观众席，不是说她会上台演奏！”

"Oh!"

Kensuke turns to me, "What happened? I mean it's been five years right?"  
健介转向我，问道：“发生了什么？我是说，已经过去五年了，对吧？”

"Yeah…" I confirm. “嗯…”我确认道。

I don't know if I should tell them the full story of what exactly happened. That's something I should probably save for later, it involves Rei and I wouldn't like them to think anything bad about Rei.  
我不知道是否应该告诉他们整个故事，关于究竟发生了什么。这事儿我可能得留到以后再说，它牵扯到丽，我不想让他们对丽有任何不好的看法。

"It was… Rei… She kinda helped get in contact with her. We've spoken to each other a few times over the past week. She… is going to be coming to Japan in December to attend the concert." I start to tell them a few things, "She's been living in Germany for the last five years."  
"是……丽……她帮忙联系上的。过去一周我们通过几次话。她……十二月会来日本参加演唱会。""我开始告诉他们一些事情，""她过去五年一直住在德国。""

"Did she say why she left?" Kensuke asks me.  
""她有说为什么离开吗？"" Kensuke 问我。

"It was my fa-" "是因为我……"

I catch myself before I finish that sentence. I hate myself for jumping to that immediately. Why am I so desperate to blame myself for Asuka leaving? Why am I so desperate to blame myself for any bad thing that happens? I know it wasn't my fault that she left. She told me that and I owe it to her to believe her when she says something like that.  
我及时打住了那句话。我讨厌自己这么快就下意识地自责。为什么我如此急于将明日香离开的责任归咎于自己？为什么任何坏事发生时，我都如此急于自责？我知道她离开并非我的错。她亲口告诉过我，我应该相信她的话。

"It was… She didn't feel comfortable here anymore." I explain. Again I wonder just how much I should tell them of what she told me. Asuka told me in confidence so she probably wouldn't be happy to have her personal issues spoken about freely.  
“那是……她在这里感到不再自在。”我解释道。我又一次思考，究竟该告诉他们多少她对我说过的话。明日香是以信任相告的，她可能不会乐意听到她的私人问题被随意谈论。

"She was dealing with a lot of baggage from piloting and Third Impact. She… didn't think being here would help that so she left."  
“她背负着驾驶 EVA 和第三次冲击带来的许多包袱。她……认为留在这里无助于解决这些问题，所以她离开了。”

"So, she just left without telling anyone?" Kensuke asks, I can hear some anger in his tone.  
"所以，她就那么不告而别了？" 健介问道，我能听出他语气中的愤怒。

"Yes." I nod. "是的。" 我点头。

"Damn, that's cold…" "该死，真无情……"

"It makes sense for her though." I look up in surprise at Touji's words, "Getting away from here… it was probably the best thing she could do.  
"对她来说，这很合理。" 我惊讶地抬头，听着冬二的话，"离开这里……这可能是她能做的最好的事了。"

"Well yeah!" Kensuke adds, "I mean she wasn't the most pleasant person was she? Probably would have just ended up hu-"  
"嗯，没错！" 真希跳出来说，"我是说她不是最讨人喜欢的，对吧？可能最后只会……"

"I don't mean that." Touji cuts him off, "Asuka… suffered didn't she Shinji?"  
"我不是那个意思。" 冬二打断了他，"明日香……她受了很多苦，不是吗，真嗣？"

I nod my head, "Yes."  
我点点头，“是的。”

I watch as Touji clenches his hand into a fist and shakes his head, "NERV… The Eva... They didn't do anyone any good, I don't know what happened to or with Asuka but I think she did the right thing. If she had to go then… it was the best thing for her. If it hurt her then… it makes sense."  
我看着东治紧握拳头，摇着头说：“NERV… 使徒... 他们没给任何人带来好处，我不知道明日香发生了什么，但我觉得她做对了。如果她不得不离开…那对她来说是最好的。如果这伤害了她…那也说得通。”

As I listen to Touji I thing I finally start to understand those words he said to me a long time ago about Asuka leaving possibly being the best thing for her. He wasn't being malicious, it was almost as if he understand why she left. He didn't need to know about her past or what she suffered, he just knew that she, like anyone who came into contact with Eva, had suffered.  
听着东治的话，我终于开始理解很久以前他对我说过关于明日香离开可能是对她最好的那些话。他并非出于恶意，就好像他理解她为何离开。他不需要知道她的过去或她遭受了什么，他只是知道，像所有接触过使徒的人一样，她遭受了痛苦。

Touji will understand that. He felt it first hand when he piloted, he had suffered beforehand when his sister was hospitalized. He watched as one of his friends spiraled downwards before his very eyes. For all the front he might put up, for the image he puts out he isn't stupid and he is a very understanding person.  
阿薰会理解的。他亲自驾驶时感受到了这一切，他的妹妹住院时他也曾遭受痛苦。他亲眼看着他的一个朋友在他眼前不断堕落。尽管他可能会表现出坚强的一面，为了维护形象，他并不愚蠢，而且是一个非常善解人意的人。

"Was it that bad for her though?" Kensuke asks, "I mean… she never really seemed to suffer?"  
“对她来说有那么糟糕吗？” 真希波问道，“我是说…她似乎从未真正表现出痛苦？”

I nod, "It was… She just… wasn't very good at saying anything."  
我点点头，“确实如此…她只是…不太擅长表达。”

Touji laughs, "Not like any of you were very good at that. Well I guess Hikari will be happy about it. I reckon she's missed her almost as much as you have!"  
“你们几个在这方面都不怎么样。不过我想光会高兴的。我猜她几乎和你一样想念她！”

I feel myself blush as I look down at my bowl and scoop up some more noodles.  
我感到自己脸红了，低头看着碗，又舀了一些面条。

"Oh yeah of course!" I hear Kensuke speak, "So I suppose you'll be the first to meet her at the airport won't you Shinji!"  
“哦，当然！”我听到真希说，“所以我想你会是第一个在机场接她的人，对吧，真嗣！”

I'm not going to respond to them. I'm going to eat and ignore it.  
我不会回应他们的。我要吃饭并忽略这件事。

"We'd better make sure we get him a proper suit and help him pick out flowers and chocolates for her."  
我们最好确保给他买一套合适的西装，并帮他挑选送给她的鲜花和巧克力。

I can feel my cheeks burning at their teasing. It's not like I haven't thought about it though. It's not like I haven't dreamed about that moment she returns. Me being there at the airport in a suit, giving her flowers and chocolates. Me spending time with her, holding her hand and holding her. I'm just not going to tell them that.  
他们的调侃让我感到脸颊发烫。虽然我并非没有想过这些。我并非没有梦见过她回来的那一刻。我穿着西装，在机场给她鲜花和巧克力。我与她共度时光，牵着她的手，拥抱她。我只是不打算告诉他们这些。

Instead I try to move the conversation on, "You two are alright with it?" I just… I know she wasn't… well she could be…"  
相反，我试图转移话题，“你们俩对此没意见吧？”我只是……我知道她不是……嗯，她可能会……”

"Loud?" Kensuke says. “大声？” 真希波说。

"Arrogant?" Touji adds. “傲慢？” 东治补充道。

"Obnoxious?" Kensuke speaks.  
"讨厌吗？" 真嗣开口道。

"A total bitch?" Touji says.  
"完全是个泼妇？" 冬二说。

"Well... I wouldn't have been as unkind but I know you guys didn't really get on with her I guess..." I gaze down at the table.  
"嗯...我不会说得这么刻薄，但我知道你们和她相处得并不好，我想..." 我低头看着桌子。

"She wasn't so bad..." Touji says.  
"她其实没那么糟糕..." 冬二说道。

Kensuke chips in, "Yeah I mean… It's not like we didn't give as good as good as she gave us. Besides that was years ago."  
剑介插话道，"是啊，我的意思是…我们也没少还手。再说，那都是好几年前的事了。"

I feel myself smile, "Yeah… It was. Thanks guys."  
我感到自己笑了，"是啊…确实。谢谢你们。"

I resume eating and we continue to discuss a variety of things. That went a lot better than I thought, I thought that they would be against the idea of her being here. After the way she used to be back when she was here I thought they were happy to see the back of her and wouldn't want her back. Yet they seem happy that she is going to be visiting.  
我继续吃饭，我们继续讨论各种事情。这比我预想的要好得多，我原以为他们会反对她来这里的想法。毕竟她以前在这里的时候是那样的人，我以为他们乐于见到她离开，不会再想让她回来。然而，他们似乎很高兴她将要来访。

I'm glad they're happy and I feel like for the first time in a long I'm happy too.  
我很高兴他们开心，而且我觉得自己也很久没有这么开心了。

**30th September 2021 – Kaworu Nagisa  
2021 年 9 月 30 日 – 渚薰**

I turn myself around on the stool and watch as the woman leaves the room. She seemed to be quite satisfied with how the lesson went. It would seem that the advice I gave her last week was helpful. Our lesson today was spent analyzing the beginnings of the song she would like to learn. Over the past week I actually listened to the song several times, making notes of the chords used, the key it is in and dividing it up into sections.  
我转过身坐在凳子上，看着那位女士离开房间。她似乎对今天的课程进展相当满意。看来我上周给她的建议颇有帮助。今天的课程我们主要分析了她想学的那首歌的开头部分。过去一周里，我实际上多次聆听这首歌，记录了使用的和弦、调性，并将其划分为几个部分。

I gave her the information I thought appropriate for the moment and we started to analyze the beginning of the song. Again I broke it down, helping her to understand the time signature used which in this case was a standard 4/4 as well as the tempo of the song. We then went over the chord changes for each bar of the introduction so she could get her left hand movement down. As an exercise I've given her the notation and asked if she could learn the first three bars of the song for next week.  
我向她提供了我认为当时合适的信息，然后我们开始分析歌曲的开头。我再次将其分解，帮助她理解所使用的时间签名，这次是标准的 4/4 拍，以及歌曲的节奏。接着，我们逐一过了一遍引子部分的和弦变化，以便她能掌握左手移动的技巧。作为练习，我给了她乐谱，并请她能否在下节课前学会歌曲的前三个小节。

She seemed keen to learn and she was actually able to listen to and play the chord changes for the introduction. It is my hope that she can not only learn this whole piece eventually but understand how I am breaking things down to help her learn other pieces in the future and perhaps even compose her own works one day.  
她似乎很渴望学习，实际上能够听懂并演奏出引子部分的和弦变化。我希望她不仅能最终学会这首完整的曲子，还能理解我是如何分解这些内容来帮助她学习未来其他曲目，甚至有一天能自己创作作品。

With the room now empty I look around and wonder what I should do for the rest of this morning. Unfortunately, my other morning lesson has had to cancel due to a sudden illness. It is a shame because they seemed enthusiastic about learning too but I expect I shall see them next week. My next sessions are not until this afternoon. I must admit, I am looking forward to seeing the two beginners again to see how much progress has been made.  
房间现在空无一人，我环顾四周，思考着这个上午剩下的时间该做些什么。不幸的是，我另一节早上的课因为突然生病不得不取消。真遗憾，因为他们看起来也很热衷于学习，但我预计下周会见到他们。我的下一次课程要到下午才开始。我必须承认，我很期待再次见到那两位初学者，看看他们取得了多少进步。

I could go home and relax until I need to return for the lesson but in the time it would take me to travel home and then get ready to come back and set everything up I do not think I would get much time to relax. Staying here is a more viable option but I cannot simply sit in this room for all that time. Except this is a part of town I'm not yet familiar with and this building is full of people I do not yet know.  
我可以回家放松，直到需要回来上课，但来回奔波和准备的时间让我觉得并没有多少时间可以放松。留在这里是一个更可行的选择，但我不能就这样在这个房间里坐那么久。只是这个街区我还不太熟悉，这栋楼里也满是我还不认识的人。

Those two facts scare me, and I know they shouldn't scare me but what happened to me all those weeks ago is still a vivid memory. I still fear going outside in case the same thing happens again. I am used to the commute from Fuyutsuki's office to home and going for short walks around the area but this is an unknown area to me. I suppose that I, like many humans fear the unknown even though this seems like such a minor thing.  
这两个事实让我害怕，我知道它们不该让我害怕，但几周前发生在我身上的事至今仍历历在目。我仍然害怕出门，生怕同样的事情再次发生。我已经习惯了从富士津树的办公室到家之间的通勤，以及在附近短途散步，但这个地方对我来说是未知的。我想，就像许多人类一样，我害怕未知，尽管这似乎是一件微不足道的事情。

It is unlikely that anyone would attack me again. Fuyutsuki has a new security team watching us, one that he has personally vetted himself. The two that did attack me were assigned to me as a result of complacency by the UN. I still fear them though and I still fear the people I walk past on the street.  
再次有人攻击我的可能性不大。富士津树安排了一支新的安保团队在监视我们，这支团队是他亲自审查过的。那两个攻击我的人是因为联合国的疏忽而被分配给我的。尽管如此，我仍然害怕他们，也害怕我在街上经过的那些人。

I take a deep breath and think of what Asuka would say to me at this time. She'd tell me to not let my fear hold me back because I have nothing to be afraid of. To think of her warms my heart and I imagine holding her hand as we walk through town as we have done a number of times. No one ever recognized us then, we were completely safe. I have nothing to fear, I can do this.  
我深吸一口气，想起了此时明日香会对我说什么。她会告诉我不要让恐惧阻碍我，因为我没有什么好害怕的。想到她，我的心感到温暖，我仿佛能感受到我们手牵手走在镇上的情景，就像我们多次做过的那样。那时没有人认出我们，我们完全安全。我没有什么好害怕的，我能做到。

I start to pack my sheet music and books away into my bag but midway through I'm interrupted by the sound of my phone vibrating nearby. I quickly get up and rush over to it smiling hoping that it is Asuka. When I pick up the phone I see it is actually a number that I don't recognize.  
我开始将乐谱和书本收拾进包里，但中途被附近手机震动的声音打断。我迅速起身，笑着冲过去，希望是明日香。当我拿起手机时，却发现是一个不认识的号码。

Curiously I answer the phone, "Hello?"  
我好奇地接起电话，"喂？"

_"Hello..." “喂……”_

The voice speaks and then trails off, it's a soft voice and at first, I don't recognize it. Only at first though, they move past the initial greeting and I slowly start to recognize with shock who it is.  
那声音响起，随后渐渐消失，轻柔而起初我并未辨认出来。但仅是起初，他们越过最初的问候，我渐渐震惊地意识到那是谁。

_"I-Is that Kaworu Nagisa?"  
“我-我是渚薰吗？”_

My mouth opens to say yes but no sound actually comes out. Instead I feel my chest tight and I feel like time has slowed down all around me. There can be no mistaking it, the voice on the other end of the phone belong to Shinji Ikari. That nervousness I hear from them, the softness of their voice, it is him but... why is he calling me? How has he got my number?  
我张嘴想说“是”，却发不出任何声音。相反，我感到胸口紧绷，仿佛时间在我周围放慢了。毫无疑问，电话那头是碇真嗣的声音。我听到的紧张，他们声音的柔和，是他没错……但他为何打给我？他又是如何得到我的号码的？

I take a quick breath to compose myself to give him a reply, "Yes... Yes, it is..."  
我深吸一口气，稳住心神，准备给他一个答复，“是的... 是的，确实是...”

I have to sit myself back down on the piano stool, I feel dizzy knowing that he is on the other end of the line. After I reply there is silence, an uncomfortable silence and I can imagine him stood or sat there struggling to find something to say. You haven't changed in that regard, have you Shinji? Not that I'm coping much better though, in addition to the dizziness my mouth has gone completely dry.  
我不得不重新坐回钢琴凳上，得知他在电话那头，我感到一阵眩晕。回复之后，是一片沉默，令人不安的沉默，我能想象他站在或坐在那里，努力寻找话题。你在这方面一点都没变，是吗，真嗣？不过我也不比你好多少，除了眩晕，我的嘴巴也完全干了。

My hand is shaking as I try to figure out what to do. Maybe I should say something? I take a moment to compose myself again and finally speak, "It... It's Shinji isn't it?"  
我的手在颤抖，试图弄清楚该做什么。也许我该说些什么？我再次稳住自己，终于开口，“是... 是真嗣，对吧？”

I already know the answer to my question but I had to say something and nothing else springs to mind. I can hardly ask him how he is, can I? I can hardly ask him what he has been up to all these years. I can't have a normal conversation with him, I haven't earned that right.  
我其实已经知道问题的答案，但总得说点什么，一时又想不出别的。我总不能问他最近怎么样，对吧？也不能问他这些年都在忙些什么。我没法和他正常交谈，我没那个资格。

Perhaps... Perhaps a part of me is hoping that it isn't really Shinji and it's just someone who happens to sound like him and knows my name. It could be someone else entirely, some nervous person wanting me to do a survey. That is unlikely though and I know it, this definitely is Shinji and it seems the time has come for our inevitable first discussion.  
或许……或许我内心某处还抱着一丝希望，希望这不是真嗣，只是某个声音相似、恰巧知道我名字的人。可能是完全不相干的某个人，一个紧张兮兮想让我填问卷的人。虽然这不太可能，我知道这肯定是真嗣，看来我们不可避免的第一次对话即将到来。

In truth I've wanted this for a while. I've wanted to speak to him. I want an opportunity to apologize to him. To explain things to him and maybe put things right. I never expected that he would contact me first though. I didn't expect to communicate with him at all, not until December when I travel to Japan. By then I had hoped that Asuka would have sorted things out and it'd have been easier.  
说实话，我渴望这一刻已经很久了。我想和他说话。我想有机会向他道歉，向他解释，也许还能弥补些什么。但我从没想过会是他先联系我。我本以为我们至少要等到十二月我去日本时才会有交流。那时我希望明日香已经把事情处理好，一切都会变得容易些。

_"Yes... Yes, it is..."_ Shinji finally replies to me, I can hear his voice shaking as he speaks.  
“是的……是的，确实是……” 真嗣终于回答了我，我能听出他说话时声音在颤抖。

After his confirmation all turns silent again. This silence lasts for thirty or so seconds as I try to figure out what to say to him next. What can I say to him? What am I supposed to say in this sort of situation? I don't think there is a guide for it, I can't imagine anyone has ever been in this situation before. Do I start by apologizing? Do I do that simple thing and see what happens from there?  
在他确认之后，一切再次陷入沉默。这种沉默持续了大约三十秒，我试图想出接下来该对他说些什么。我能对他说什么呢？在这种情境下我应该说什么？我不认为有这方面的指南，我无法想象以前有人经历过这种情况。我应该从道歉开始吗？我是否应该简单地这样做，然后看看会发生什么？

I also wonder why he's called me today of all days. I wonder if Asuka has anything to do with it, she has been speaking to him recently and the two of them seem to be friends. I know she has mentioned mine and his friendship to him too. From what I understand she has not mentioned that the two of us are more than friends.  
我也想知道为什么他偏偏在今天叫我来。我想知道明日香是否与此有关，她最近一直在和他交谈，他们俩似乎成了朋友。我知道她也曾向他提到过我和他的友谊。据我所知，她没有提到我们俩不仅仅是朋友。

The timing is strange though, myself and Asuka have become more comfortable with one another and our relationship. Last night we were physically intimate for the first time, it was a wonderful experience. Asuka seemed to enjoy it as well, I wonder if our relationship moving to this stage has prompted Asuka to try to do more to mend the bridge between myself and Shinji.  
时机确实有些蹊跷，我和明日香之间的关系日渐融洽。昨晚我们第一次有了肌肤之亲，那是一次美妙的体验。明日香似乎也很享受，我在想是不是我们的关系进入这一阶段促使明日香更努力地修复我和真嗣之间的裂痕。

I wonder then if she has mentioned the relationship. I don't know what effect that would have had on Shinji though. I know he has feelings for her and I can sense the feelings that she has for him. I still fear that what I have with Asuka is only temporary, when she talks about Shinji she seems to glow. It would be best to tread carefully when mentioning Asuka. Perhaps I shouldn't mention her at all.  
我在想她是否提过我们的关系。虽然不清楚这对真嗣会有什么影响，但我知道他对她有感情，也能感受到她对他的情愫。我仍担心我和明日香的关系只是暂时的，每当她谈及真嗣时，她似乎都在发光。提到明日香时最好谨慎行事，或许我根本不该提及她。

"I'm sorry." I finally speak.  
“对不起。”我终于开口道。

As the same time that I start to speak I hear Shinji also speak, _"Kaworu, I'm sorry."_  
就在我开始说话的同时，我听到真嗣也开口了，“薰，对不起。”

His words bring a smile to my lips as I shake my head, why, oh why are you apologizing to me Shinji? You have nothing to be sorry for. I was the one who wrong you and everyone else in this world. Do you not remember that? I was the one to hurt and betray you. I was the one who pushed you to the brink of despair.  
他的话让我摇头微笑，为什么，哦为什么你要向我道歉呢，真嗣？你没有对不起任何人。是我伤害了你，也伤害了这个世界上的每一个人。你不记得了吗？是我让你受伤，背叛了你。是我把你推向绝望的边缘。

The silence between us doesn't last as long this time, _"A-Asuka... She gave me your number and said that... I should contact you but..."_  
这次我们之间的沉默没有持续太久，“明日香...她给了我你的号码，说...我应该联系你，但是...”

So, I was right. Asuka did tell Shinji to contact me, I'm not sure if she meant to do it now or to wait. From what I understand she probably would have preferred it done sooner rather than later. After all, she knows the impact of putting something off for a long time.  
看来我猜对了。明日香确实让真嗣联系我，我不确定她是想让他现在就做，还是稍后再说。据我所知，她可能更倾向于尽早解决，而不是拖延。毕竟，她深知长时间搁置某事的后果。

"I am glad that you did Sh-"  
"我很高兴你这么做了，真-

I catch myself before speaking his name. It does not seem appropriate to refer to him by his first name like that. I am not his close friend anymore, I do not have the right to refer to him so informally. What then do I say?  
我及时打住，没有说出他的名字。用他的名字称呼他似乎不太合适。我已经不是他的密友了，我没有权利这样随意地称呼他。那我该怎么说呢？

"I am glad that you did... Mr Ikari..."  
"我很高兴你这么做了... 碇先生..."

The words leave my lips and I'm left thinking about how strange it sounds to refer to him in such a way. It sounded forced and weird, Shinji isn't a 'Mr Ikari', it doesn't fit with the person I knew at all. Yet, I don't feel I deserve the right to speak his first name, I shouldn't really have said anything at all.  
这些话从我口中说出，我却在想这样称呼他有多奇怪。听起来很勉强，也很别扭，真嗣不是'碇先生'，这完全不符合我所认识的那个人。然而，我觉得自己没有资格直呼他的名字，其实我根本不该说任何话。

_"Mr Ikari?"_ He asks me in confusion, _"P-Please... call me Shinji... Unless you would rather me call you Mr Nagisa?"_  
"碇先生？" 他困惑地问我，"请...叫我真嗣吧...除非你更希望我叫你渚先生？"

"Yeah... okay... Shinji..." I nod my head, it does seem more natural to say his name like that. It felt so wrong to say Mr Ikari. I also smile again, realizing the strange reversal of roles in this conversation. Was this not similar to something I said to him all those years ago?  
"嗯...好吧...真嗣..." 我点点头，这样称呼他确实感觉更自然。叫他碇先生总觉得不对劲。我又笑了笑，意识到这场对话中角色的奇妙颠倒。这不就像多年前我对他说过的话吗？

There is another pause, this is awkward, there is so much I'd like to say to him right now and yet my mind is preventing me from saying any of it. This is not like it was when I met him for the first time. I was able to approach him with confidence then but this is different. When I did that I had a goal and a purpose that had been given to me. I had nothing to fear, nothing to be ashamed of. I didn't expect that I would actually feel something for him.  
又是一阵沉默，这很尴尬，我有很多话想对他说，但我的思绪却阻止我说出口。这和我第一次见他时不一样。那时我能自信地接近他，但这次不同。当时我有目标和使命在身，无所畏惧，无所羞愧。我没想到自己真的会对他产生感情。

_"Sorry I… I'm not very good at this…"_ I hear him say, _"Asuka said… that I should speak to you. I… I guess I should have thought of something to say first though."_  
"对不起我…我不太擅长这个…" 我听到他说，"明日香说…我应该和你谈谈。我…我想我应该先想好要说什么。"

I wonder… I wonder if maybe you did think of something to say Shinji but much like me you can't bring yourself to say those things. I wonder what those things would be, are you upset? Are you angry with me? Do you hate me? I would not blame you if you did.  
我在想……我在想你是否也有话想对真嗣说，就像我一样，却难以启齿。我在想那些话会是什么，你是不是不高兴？你是不是生我的气？你是不是恨我？如果你真的恨我，我不会怪你。

"It is fine…" I reply with half a smile, "Just say whatever is within your heart."  
“没关系……”我半笑着回答，“把心里的话说出来就好。”

I frown immediately after saying that to him. I sound like a facsimile of myself all those years ago. I have little else I can say though.  
说完这话，我立刻皱起了眉头。我听起来就像多年前那个自己的复制品。除此之外，我也没什么可说的了。

_"Okay I…"_ There is another short pause as I hear him take a deep breath, _"I guess… I wanted to know if it was true… that you are really human now. I mean… they are all saying that you are… I… wanted to know the truth though."_  
"好吧，我……" 他又短暂地停顿了一下，我听到他深吸了一口气，"我想……我想知道这是不是真的……你现在真的是人类了。我是说……大家都在说你是……我……虽然想知道真相。"

I admittedly wasn't expecting him to ask me that. It would seem that others have already told him about my current state of being. I'm not offended by the question, it makes sense that people would have doubts related to who I am. It is something that would be quite hard to believe, I just wasn't expecting Shinji to ask me it in such a direct fashion.  
老实说，我没想到他会问我这个问题。看来其他人已经告诉他我目前的状态了。我并不介意这个问题，人们对我身份的怀疑是可以理解的。这确实是一个很难相信的事情，我只是没想到真嗣会这么直接地问我。

"Yes." I confirm confidently, "I am human… I am no longer an Angel."  
"是的。" 我肯定地确认道，"我是人类……不再是天使了。"

_"Good." “好。”_

Shinji trails off once again after his reply and we go back to silence. I decide that maybe I should say something. It seems unfair for me to expect him to say everything in this conversation. It is I who should be speaking to him, I should be apologizing and explaining it all for him. I shouldn't be expecting him to ask me twenty questions.  
回应之后，真嗣再次陷入沉默，我们又回到了静默中。我决定或许我该说些什么。期望他在这场对话中承担所有发言似乎不公平。本应是我向他倾诉，我应该道歉并为他解释一切。我不该期待他向我提出二十个问题。

I think about how our meeting went the first time around. I approached him when he stood by the edge of that water. I sang and spoke to him. I befriended him, took advantage of his grief and told him what I thought he'd want to hear. I made him uncomfortable at times as well, my lack of human understanding contributed to that.  
我回想起我们第一次见面的情景。那时他站在水边，我向他走去，唱歌并对他讲话。我与他结交，利用他的悲伤，告诉他我认为他想听的话。有时我也让他感到不适，我对人类情感的无知是原因之一。

I want to apologize for everything, I want to explain everything to him and maybe start over with him. I take a deep breath of my own, "Shinji, you should know…"  
我想为一切道歉，想向他解释一切，也许能和他重新开始。我深吸一口气，“真嗣，你应该知道……”

It's my turn to trail off midway through my sentence as I feel a lump form in the back of my throat. I swallow it back, I'm not going to cry, not yet and not here. I need to be stronger than this, crying can wait.  
轮到我说话说到一半就停住了，因为我感觉喉咙后部形成了一个硬块。我把它咽了回去，我不会哭的，至少现在不会，在这里不会。我需要比这更坚强，哭泣可以等。

"I am… truly sorry about what happened between us back then. I would like to offer you an explanation for my actions. At the same time I fear that no explanation would be good enough for this situation."  
“我……真的为当时我们之间发生的事感到抱歉。我想为我的行为向你解释。同时，我也担心任何解释在这个情况下都不够好。”

I pause for a moment in case Shinji wants to say something to me. He doesn't say anything so I take that as a cue to continue, "Five years ago… I arrived in Tokyo-3 with a mission. I had no attachment to you nor anyone else in that city. I… befriended you and ultimately betrayed you on the orders of my masters. I won't lie and say I didn't mean to betray you, I did mean to do it when I got there but…"  
我停顿了一下，以防真嗣想对我说些什么。他没有说话，于是我便继续道：“五年前……我带着任务来到了东京-3。那时，我对你们任何人都没有感情。我……与你结交，最终却按照主人的命令背叛了你。我不会撒谎说我没有打算背叛你，我确实在到达那里时就打算这么做，但是……”

_"Does… Does that mean that you were never my friend?"_ Shinji cuts me off with his question and I feel my heart tighten in my chest.  
“那……那是不是意味着你从来都不是我的朋友？”真嗣打断了我，他的问题让我感到心口一阵紧缩。

"At first… I had no intention or really befriending you." I admit to him, "But… after our first meeting and after speaking to you more I… I saw who you were and I… I wanted to be your friend. I had never met another person besides my masters. I had not had a friend. I had not known any other person."  
“起初……我并没有真正想要与你交朋友。”我向他坦白，“但……在我们第一次见面并更多地交谈之后，我……我看到了你的真实面貌，我……我想要成为你的朋友。除了我的主人，我从未遇到过其他人。我没有朋友。我不认识其他任何人。”

I sigh, "I could not stop my mission though."  
我叹了口气，“尽管如此，我无法停止我的任务。”

_"Y-Your mission?"_ He asks me.  
“你-你的任务？”他问我。

I wonder how much Shinji knows about my true mission back then. He must know about SEELE and the truth of things by now. I do not know how much information there was left about me though, if any at all.  
我不知道真嗣当时对我的真实任务了解多少。他现在一定知道 SEELE 和事情的真相了。不过，我不清楚关于我的信息还剩下多少，如果有的话。

"To… make contact with Adam… the progenitor of the Angels… SEELE sent me to Tokyo-3 to do that." I explain to him, "They also… wanted me to make contact with you. I admit… I did question it at first."  
"为了……与亚当……使徒的始祖……接触，SEELE 派我来到东京-3 执行这一任务。" 我向他解释道，"他们还……希望我能与你建立联系。我承认……起初我对这一点也感到疑惑。"

_"Why? Why did they need me?"_ Shinji asks, _"Why did you need to befriend me?"_  
"为什么？为什么他们需要我？" 真嗣问道，"为什么你需要和我成为朋友？"

"I don't know, I questioned it at first but I did not get an answer from them." I say to him, "I was… little more than an obedient tool for them. Their orders were to befriend you and not long after I made contact they then ordered me to make contact with Adam."  
"我不知道，起初我也对此感到疑惑，但他们并未给我答案。" 我告诉他，"我……不过是他们手中顺从的工具。他们的命令是与你成为朋友，不久之后，他们又命令我去接触亚当。"

_"I… I see…"_ I can hear his voice cracking over the phone. He takes a moment to compose himself, _"Thank you… For being honest…"_  
"我…我明白了…" 我听到他在电话那头声音哽咽。他深吸一口气，平复情绪，"谢谢你…坦诚相告…"

Shinji doesn't sound angry at what I've told him. In a way I wish he was, perhaps that'd make it easier for me to know where I stand. I could accept him being angry but this… he sounds upset but I can't tell if he is angry or glad I've told him this. I dislike this uncertainty.  
真嗣听起来并不对我所说的话感到愤怒。某种程度上，我倒希望他生气，或许那样我会更容易知道自己的立场。我可以接受他的愤怒，但这种…他听起来难过，我却分不清他是生气还是因为我告诉他这些而感到高兴。我不喜欢这种不确定性。

"I am… truly sorry Shinji." I apologize to him once more, "I want you to know that by the end of things my feelings for you were genuine but it was too late for me. Every Angel was born to feel the call of the progenitor, it sang to me and whispered to me and SEELE fed that call. I could not stop it or turn back and… I thought I was truly doing the right thing. It was only when I saw it was Lilith and not Adam that I… learned the truth."  
"我…真的非常抱歉，真嗣。" 我再次向他道歉，"我想让你知道，到最后我对你的感情是真挚的，但对我来说已经太迟了。每个使徒生来都会感受到始祖的召唤，它在呼唤我，低语着，SEELE 也助长了这种召唤。我无法阻止它，也无法回头…我以为我做的是正确的。直到我发现那是莉莉丝而不是亚当…我才明白了真相。"

I pause again, "But that… does not excuse what I did to you. I am aware of that and I do not expect you to forgive me. If anything I just want you to know the truth of that situation. I am truly sorry Shinji."  
我再次停顿，“但那……并不能为我对你的所作所为开脱。我明白这一点，并不奢望你能原谅我。如果有什么我想让你知道的，那就是那件事的真相。我真的非常抱歉，真嗣。”

**Tokyo-2 - Shinji Ikari 东京-2 - 碇真嗣**

I hear Kaworu apologize to me once again and I really am unsure of what to say to him. I fear that if I open my mouth to reply I'll be sick or burst into tears. I can feel my stomach churning and the burning in my eyes. I feel like my chest is about to burst. This is all too much, the apologies and the explanations, I shouldn't have called him yet. I should have waited.  
我再次听到薰向我道歉，我真的不知道该对他说些什么。我担心如果我开口回应，可能会呕吐或突然哭出来。我能感觉到胃在翻腾，眼睛在灼烧。我感觉胸口快要炸开了。这一切都太过沉重，道歉和解释，我不该这么早打电话给他。我应该再等等。

The worst thing is that I can hear all of the emotion in Kaworu's voice as well. I can hear his voice cracking each time he speaks and it makes me unsure of what to feel. I wanted to be angry with him. I was going to demand explanations and warn him to not hurt Asuka but he is on the verge of tears just as I am. This isn't the same Kaworu I met all those years ago, this is a real… human being.  
最糟糕的是，我也能听出渚薰声音中的所有情感。每次他开口，我都能听到他声音的颤抖，这让我不确定该有什么感觉。我本想对他发怒。我打算要求解释，警告他不要伤害明日香，但他也快要哭了，就像我一样。这不是我多年前遇到的那个渚薰，这是一个真实的……人类。

I admit though, hearing the truth has hurt me. It hurt to learn that he wasn't my friend at first and approached me with the aim of manipulating me. I am glad that he has been honest about that to me. That is what I truly wanted from this, honesty.  
不过我承认，听到真相确实伤害了我。得知他最初不是我的朋友，而是带着操纵我的目的接近我，这让我感到痛苦。我很高兴他对我坦白了这一点。这才是我真正想要的，诚实。

_"Shinji I…"_ I hear him speak to me once again. I recognize the strain in his voice, he's facing the same difficulties that I am, _"I do not deserve your forgiveness and I would not blame you if you said no to this. I… would like the opportunity to talk with you more, I would like to explain everything. I want to tell you who I am and was, how I was raised and so much more."_  
“真嗣，我……”我又一次听到他对我说话。我听出了他声音中的紧张，他正面临着我同样的困难，“我不配得到你的原谅，如果你拒绝我，我不会怪你。我……希望能有机会和你多谈谈，我想解释一切。我想告诉你我是谁，我曾经是谁，我是如何被抚养长大的，还有更多。”

There is a brief pause as I mull his words over, _"Please… be honest with me though. Do not feel you have to say yes for my feelings but… I would also like the opportunity to be your friend once again."_  
我稍作停顿，思索着他的话，“请……对我坦诚。不必为了我的感受而勉强说‘是’，但是……我也希望能有机会再次成为你的朋友。”

My heart hurts and I really don't know what to say to him. His words… I can hear the emotion and sincerity in them but I just don't know. Could this just be another lie? Could this be another trick? Kaworu sounded sincere when I first met him and that didn't seem like a lie but it all ended up being one. Could this not just be a lie again?  
我的心感到疼痛，真的不知道该如何回应他。他的话……我能感受到其中的情感和真诚，但我就是不确定。这会不会又是一个谎言？会不会又是一个圈套？初次遇见卡沃鲁时，他听起来很真诚，那不像是谎言，但最终却证明一切都是假的。这次会不会又是一个谎言呢？

I think about what advice Misato and Rei would give me in this situation. They would probably advise me against it, they'd be telling me to say no and stay far away. In fact, I don't think they'd like the fact that I made this phone call in the first place.  
我想象着在这种情境下，美里和丽会给我什么建议。他们大概会劝我不要这么做，会告诉我拒绝并保持距离。事实上，我觉得他们甚至不会喜欢我打这个电话的决定。

The longer this phone call goes on the more I feel like I've made a mistake. Asuka told me to contact him but I don't think she meant right away. I just… I just thought if I did it now then it would help us all but now I just feel worn out. Now I'm stuck in this situation where I have so much to say and yet don't know what to say.  
这通电话拖得越久，我越觉得自己犯了个错误。明日香让我联系他，但我想她不是指立刻。我只是……我只是觉得如果我现在这么做，会对我们大家都好，但现在我只感到筋疲力尽。现在我陷入了这种境地，有太多话想说，却又不知道该说什么。

Should I accept it? Is that what Asuka wanted, for us to be friends again like she is friends with him. I mean if Asuka is friends with him then things must be okay, right? Asuka wouldn't let herself be tricked and manipulated in that fashion. Also, why would Kaworu be trying to trick us? The Eva's are gone now, SEELE and NERV don't exist anymore. There is nothing for him.  
我应该接受吗？这就是明日香想要的，让我们像她和他的关系一样重新成为朋友。我是说，如果明日香和他成了朋友，那事情一定没问题，对吧？明日香不会让自己被那样欺骗和操纵。而且，为什么渚薰会试图欺骗我们？EVA 已经消失了，SEELE 和 NERV 也不复存在。他没有什么可图的。

Yet I can't fight that doubt in my mind and I can't just give him an answer to his request yet. I need to think more about this. I need more time. I look at the phone in my hand and shake my head. I'm not ready for that yet.  
然而，我无法摆脱心中的疑虑，还不能给他答复。我需要更多时间来思考。我需要更多时间。我看着手中的电话，摇了摇头。我还没准备好。

"Kaworu I… I'm sorry but I ca-"  
"カヲル君… ごめんなさい、でも私…"

I don't get a chance to finish my sentence.  
我的话还没说完，就被打断了。

_"You do not need to say anything else, I understand."_ The churning in my stomach accelerates as I hear a sniff and the sounds of his voice cracking, _"Goodbye Shinji."_  
"你不需要再说什么了，我明白。"" 听到他的抽泣声和声音的颤抖，我胃里的翻腾更加剧烈，""再见，真嗣。"

Kaworu hands up immediately and I'm left simply staring at my phone in silence. He was crying when he hung the phone up. Should I call him back and apologize? Would he want to speak to me again? I feel a tear roll down my own cheek as I grip the phone tightly. I'm sorry Kaworu.  
渚薰立刻举手投降，我只能默默地盯着手机。他挂电话时在哭。我应该打回去道歉吗？他还想再和我说话吗？我感到一滴泪滑过自己的脸颊，紧紧握住手机。对不起，渚薰。

### Chapter 13: Realization

**30th September 2021 – Rei Ayanami  
2021 年 9 月 30 日 – 绫波零**

It is early evening when I return to the apartment and when I enter the front room I quickly realize that no one is home right now. This is fine, for now the silence and solitude suits me. I have had a particularly busy day at the school and then seeing Kodama for a couple of hours afterwards. Whilst I enjoy volunteering and I enjoy seeing Kodama even more the opportunity to return home and enjoy some time alone is a welcome one.  
傍晚时分，我回到公寓，走进客厅时很快意识到家里现在没人。这样挺好，此刻的宁静与独处正合我意。今天在学校特别忙碌，之后又和 Kodama 待了几个小时。虽然我很享受做志愿者，更喜欢和 Kodama 见面，但能回家享受一段独处的时光也是令人愉快的。

There might once have been a time when I would have been worried for Shinji not being home. He rarely went out, if ever up until a few weeks ago. The only time he would go out would be short trips or when there was a full group of us. Even then those would be rare occasions. Now, since he has started the rehearsals for the concert and gotten back in contact with Asuka he seems more confident and less reluctant to venture out. It pleases me that he is happy.  
曾经有一段时间，我会为真嗣不在家而感到担忧。他几乎不外出，直到几周前才有所改变。他唯一出门的时候，要么是短暂的行程，要么是我们一群人一起。即便那样，也是难得的场合。如今，自从他开始为音乐会排练并与明日香重新联系后，他似乎变得更加自信，不再那么不愿出门了。他开心，我也很高兴。

Naturally Misato is not home either. She did however mention that over the next couple of weeks she is intending on taking a short break. She even made an offer to take us away somewhere for a short holiday if we desire it. I am unsure if such a thing will be possible. With Shinji's commitments to the concert and my relationship with Kodama and the job in the school it would be difficult for us too.  
当然，美里也不在家。不过她确实提到，接下来的几周她打算休个短假。她甚至提出，如果我们愿意，可以带我们去某个地方度个小假。我不确定这样的计划是否可行。考虑到真嗣对音乐会的承诺，以及我和儿玉的关系和学校的工作，这对我们来说也颇具挑战。

All I would like is to see Misato more often. I certainly do not hold it against her that she has to work as late and as often as she does. I know she does it to ensure myself and Shinji have a home and I do believe that what she does is important. I do know she feels bad about it but she does not need to. I still would embrace the opportunity to see her more though.  
我只想更常看到美里。她工作到那么晚、那么频繁，我当然不会怪她。我知道她这么做是为了确保我和真嗣有一个家，我也确实认为她所做的一切很重要。我知道她为此感到内疚，但她不必如此。尽管如此，我仍然希望能有更多机会见到她。

At least she and both myself and Shinji are happy. This is likely to be the first time that we have all been happy and content. It is something I have wanted for so very long. I know that it is unlikely this happiness will last as it is forever, the way forward will not be simple. There will be issues and bumps in that road but we are happy for now and we should embrace that.  
至少她和我们俩，我和真嗣，都很快乐。这可能是我们第一次都感到幸福和满足。这是我渴望已久的。我知道这种幸福不会永远持续下去，前路不会平坦。会有问题和坎坷，但至少现在我们很快乐，我们应该珍惜这一点。

For me it is very simple things that are making me happy. Seeing my brother smiling so frequently, knowing that the bond between he and Asuka is being mended and of course my ongoing relationship with Kodama. This happiness is wonderful and it is strange to think that it was a feeling I did not know existed a few years ago.  
对我来说，让我感到快乐的都是一些很简单的事情。看到哥哥经常微笑，知道他和明日香之间的关系正在修复，当然还有我和 Kodama 持续发展的关系。这种幸福感很美妙，令人难以置信的是，几年前我甚至不知道这种感觉的存在。

I stretch myself out on the couch and wonder what I should do for the rest of the evening. Tonight is supposed to be my turn to prepare dinner but with Shinji still out and Misato not back yet it seems pointless to do anything right now. In addition I lack the motivation to do anything, perhaps I should just pay for something to be delivered instead.  
我伸展身体躺在沙发上，思索着今晚剩下的时间该做些什么。今晚本该轮到我准备晚餐，但真嗣还没回来，美里也还没到家，现在做任何事似乎都毫无意义。此外，我也没有动力去做任何事，也许我应该叫外卖。

I would go and get my laptop to look at potential places to order from but I am now lying on the sofa and very comfortable here. I did not realize how exhausted I was from seeing Kodama until I started to lie down. Perhaps I should do something else, I have been meaning to contact Asuka for a week or so now. I can do that whilst lying down.  
我本想拿笔记本电脑看看有哪些外卖可选，但现在我躺在沙发上，感觉非常舒适。直到我开始躺下，我才意识到自己有多疲惫，这都是因为见了小玉。或许我应该做点别的，我已经有大约一周的时间想联系明日香了。我可以躺着做这件事。

I have not spoken to Asuka much since she and Shinji started to speak again. In a way I feel like I should give the two of them more time to speak and any time I speak to her would use up that time. I admittedly am still feeling quite ashamed of my actions leading up to the two of them speaking again. I know that both of them have said they forgive me and that it was fine but I still do not feel good about the situation.  
自从她和真嗣重新开始交流后，我与明日香的交流就少了很多。在某种程度上，我觉得应该给他们俩更多时间交谈，而我与她交谈的每一分钟都会占用这些时间。不可否认，我对自己促使他们重新交流的行为仍感到相当羞愧。我知道他们俩都说过原谅我，事情已经过去了，但我仍然对这种情况感到不安。

I am also apprehensive about hearing more regarding her ongoing relationship with Nagisa. Having had more time to think about things I admit that perhaps I have been unfair regarding that situation. It has been nine months since he arrived at the emergence center and he has not done anything untoward. It has been confirmed to me that he is human and no trace of the Angel he was remains.  
我也对听到更多关于她和渚正在发展的关系感到忧虑。经过更多时间的思考，我承认或许在那件事上我并不公平。自从他九个月前来到融合中心以来，他并没有做出任何不当行为。我已经确认他是人类，他曾经作为天使的痕迹已荡然无存。

In addition he has been friends with Asuka for a couple of months and caused her no harm. If anything it has been he who has been hurt. He was the one who was attacked, it was something that I know we all feared would happen to each of us. We all played a role in the events leading up to Third Impact and we carry that with us each day. Yet deep down we all knew it was illogical to fear someone hurting us. Except… that very thing did happen to Nagisa.  
此外，他与明日香成为朋友已有几个月，并未对她造成伤害。相反，他才是受伤的那一个。他遭到了攻击，我知道我们都曾担心这样的事会发生在每个人身上。我们都参与了导致第三次冲击的事件，并每天背负着这些记忆。然而，内心深处我们都知道害怕某人伤害我们是毫无逻辑的。除了……渚确实遭遇了那种事。

Yet, I still cannot bring myself to trust him. I fear for Asuka's safety despite knowing that my friend is not likely to let anyone hurt her so easily. I also know that if she did not trust him then she would not let him get close to her. She would never have gotten involved with him.  
然而，我仍然无法让自己信任他。尽管我知道我的朋友不太可能轻易让任何人伤害明日香，我还是担心她的安全。我也明白，如果她不信任他，她就不会让他接近自己。她绝不会与他有所牵扯。

I suppose another part of me feels some resentment towards that friendship too. It is illogical but I fear that her friendship with him could spell an end to her friendship with me, after all they live in the same city, and it is easier for the two of them to see one another. If she also has contact with Shinji again and re-develops that bond then where would that leave me?  
我想，我内心的一部分也对这段友谊感到些许怨恨。这虽不合逻辑，但我担心她与他的友谊可能会终结她与我的友情，毕竟他们住在同一个城市，两人相见更为容易。如果她再次与真嗣接触并重新建立那种联系，那我该怎么办？

I am an outsider, I always have been and I filled that gap for Asuka whilst she came to terms with who she was. Now she seems to have what she needs so my role is done, isn't it?  
我始终是个局外人，一直以来都是，而我在明日香接受自我身份的过程中填补了那个空缺。如今她似乎已拥有所需的一切，我的角色也就此结束，不是吗？

No, it isn't. I know this isn't true and yet I ask myself these questions. My friendship with Asuka is not over, nor will it be.  
不，并非如此。我知道这不是真的，但我仍会问自己这些问题。我与明日香的友谊并未结束，也不会结束。

My other fear is that what she has with Kaworu seems to have developed into a romance with him. Perhaps it was wrong of me but I dislike this. I always envisioned Asuka and my brother being together. I know they have had their difficulties but there was always a strong bond between them that transcended being friends.  
我另一个担忧是，她和渚薰之间的关系似乎已经发展成了一段恋情。也许是我错了，但我对此感到不快。我一直想象着明日香和我哥哥能在一起。我知道他们之间有过困难，但他们总有一种超越友谊的深厚联系。

I was so certain within my heart that they would resolve these difficulties and finally begin that relationship. Therefore Asuka falling for another does not sit right with me. It does not feel right, especially when I am more than aware of my brother's feelings for her. I can only imagine how heartbroken he'll be when he finds out.  
我内心深处如此确信他们会克服这些困难，最终开始那段关系。因此，明日香爱上别人让我觉得不对劲。这感觉不对，尤其是当我清楚地知道我哥哥对她的感情时。我只能想象当他发现这一切时会有多么心碎。

I try to rid my head of these thoughts. It is not right of me to think such things. Asuka and Shinji are both adults and it is not up to me to think in such a way. My brother will have other opportunities to find love as time goes on and Asuka deserves love and happiness as well. I should be supportive of Asuka's choices and if Shinji is hurt then I will be there to support him as well.  
我试图摆脱这些念头。我不该这样想。明日香和真嗣都是成年人，轮不到我来这样想。随着时间的推移，我哥哥会有其他机会找到爱情，而明日香也值得拥有爱和幸福。我应该支持明日香的选择，如果真嗣受伤了，我也会在那里支持他。

I pull my phone out of my pocket but as I so I hear the door to the apartment opening. I listen for the voice and hear a mumbled 'I'm home' from Shinji. Immediately the tone of his voice makes me worry.  
我从口袋里掏出手机，但就在这时，我听到公寓的门开了。我倾听着声音，听到真嗣含糊地说了一句‘我回来了’。他声音中的语气立刻让我担心起来。

"Welcome home!" I call back to him, sit up and listen as he makes his way through the corridor and into the front room. As he enters I can see that I was not wrong to be concerned. He is visibly upset about something.  
“欢迎回家！”我朝他喊道，坐起身来，听着他穿过走廊进入前厅。当他进来时，我可以看到我的担忧并非多余。他显然对某事感到不安。

I stand up, "Shinji, is everything okay?"  
我站起身来，“真嗣，一切都好吗？”

Shinji looks at me, his mouth open ever so slightly. He closes his mouth and I see him swallow before he finally shakes his head, "No… I… I spoke to Kaworu…"  
真嗣看着我，嘴巴微微张开。他合上嘴，我看到他咽了咽口水，然后终于摇了摇头，“不……我……我跟薰说过话……”

I move around to him quickly and hug him tightly. I say nothing to him but already my mind is jumping to what feared. Shinji has found out that Asuka and Nagisa are romantically involved and it has hurt him deeply. I remain silent as I release him from the hug and watch as he wipes his eye. I gently guide him towards the couch and sit him down. I sit down on the seat opposite and take his hand.  
我迅速绕到他身边，紧紧地抱住他。我没有对他说什么，但我的思绪已经跳到了最害怕的事情上。真嗣发现了明日香和渚之间的浪漫关系，这让他深受伤害。我保持沉默，松开拥抱，看着他擦了擦眼睛。我温柔地引导他走向沙发，让他坐下。我坐在对面的座位上，握住他的手。

He takes a few moments to compose himself, "I… It was my own fault…"  
他花了几分钟整理情绪，“我……这都是我自己的错……”

"What do you mean?" I ask curiously.  
"你是什么意思？" 我好奇地问。

"Asuka… We were talking and she said that maybe I should speak to Kaworu sometime." Shinji shakes his head after he speaks, "I… I was an idiot though. I just went right ahead and did it. I didn't think about what I wanted to say or what might happen, I just charged in and called him!"  
"明日香…我们聊天时，她说也许我应该找个时间跟渚薰谈谈。" 真嗣说完后摇了摇头，"我…我当时真是傻。我直接就那么做了。我没考虑过自己想说什么或者可能会发生什么，就直接冲上去给他打电话了！"

"I see." I stroke his hand with my thumb to comfort him. This would admittedly not be the first time my brother has been impulsive at an incorrect moment. I suppose at least the consequences are less dire this time around, "I presume that things did not go as you expected?"  
"我明白了。" 我用拇指抚摸他的手以安慰他。不得不说，这已经不是我哥哥第一次在不恰当的时刻冲动行事了。我想至少这次后果没那么严重，"我猜事情并没有如你所愿？"

"I don't know what I was expecting." Shinji shrugs, "He… He apologized to me though."  
"我不知道我原本期待什么。" 真嗣耸耸肩，"但他……他向我道歉了。"

"That is a good thing then." I reply to him whilst also making an attempt to push my own personal feelings for Nagisa to one side. Whilst I have recognized that I might have been unfair towards him it is still going to take some time for me to see him as anything other than a threat.  
"那倒是件好事。" 我回答他，同时努力把自己的个人感情对渚的放在一边。虽然我意识到自己可能对他不公平，但要我把他看作不是威胁的人还需要时间。

In truth this situation is not going to help that, clearly something has happened between them to upset my brothers. Now is not an appropriate time for my misgivings though. Shinji needs me support and not my feelings about Nagisa.  
事实上，这种情况无助于此，显然他们之间发生了什么事情让我的兄弟们不高兴。但现在不是我表达对渚的疑虑的时候。真嗣需要我的支持，而不是我对渚的感情。

"I'm sorry Rei." Shinji lowers his head, "I'm so stupid. I should have waited and spoke to Asuka more about what to say. I should have come to you and Misato. I… I don't know what I was thinking, I thought it'd be easy but…"  
"对不起，丽。" 真嗣低下头，"我真笨。我应该等一等，多和明日香商量一下该说什么。我应该来找你和美里。我……我不知道我当时在想什么，我以为这会很简单，但是……"

I squeeze his hand and quickly move to cut him off, "Shinji, you are not stupid. You are your own person and free to make decisions by yourself. You do not need permission from myself or Misato.  
我紧握他的手，迅速打断他，"真嗣，你并不笨。你是独立的个体，可以自由地自己做决定。你不需要我的许可或美里的同意。

"I know that Rei I just…" he lets out a sigh, "If I had spoken to you or Misato first I could have worked out what to say to him. If I had spoken to Asuka first she could have arranged it with him for us to speak so he'd be prepared. Instead I… I just made a mess of it…"  
"我知道，丽，我只是……" 他叹了口气，"如果我先和你或美里商量，我就能想好该怎么对他说。如果我先和明日香商量，她可以安排好让他准备好和我们谈话。结果我……我只是把事情搞砸了……"

I raise a curious eyebrow, "Did you argue when you spoke?"  
我好奇地挑起眉毛，“你说话时争吵了吗？”

Shinji shakes his head, "No, we didn't. If we had then… maybe this'd have been easier."  
真嗣摇摇头，“没有，我们没有争吵。如果我们吵了……也许事情会简单些。”

"Then tell me what happened." I say to him.  
“那告诉我发生了什么。”我对他说。

"I called him and… I didn't really know what to say. I… I started by asking if he was really human now, I guess… I had heard it from you and Asuka and I had no reason to doubt it but I wanted to hear it from him."  
"我给他打了电话，然后……我真的不知道该说什么。我……我一开始问他现在是不是真的变成人类了，我想……我是从你和明日香那里听说的，我没有理由怀疑，但我还是想听他亲口说。"

I nod, I can understand that. Whilst it is one thing to hear about something it means more to have confirmation from the person themselves, "I understand your desire to hear him say that. Did his answer satisfy you?"  
我点点头，我能理解。虽然听别人说起是一回事，但能从当事人那里得到确认意义更重大，“我理解你想听他亲口说的愿望。他的回答让你满意吗？”

"I guess…" Shinji shrugs again, "After that though I couldn't really think of anything else to say. I wanted to tell him how I felt but the truth is I didn't know. I wish I could have just yelled at him or something and told him I hated him for what he did to me..."  
"我想……" 真嗣又耸了耸肩，"但之后我就真的想不出还有什么可说的了。我想告诉他我的感受，但说实话，我不知道。我真希望我能对他大吼大叫，告诉他我恨他对我所做的一切……"

"That is not who you are though." I tell Shinji, "Also I do not feel that you hate Nagisa."  
"那并不是你的本质。" 我对真嗣说，"而且我感觉你并不恨渚。"

"No… I don't. If I did then it'd have been easier but I don't because I don't understand. I don't know why he did what he did, I don't know what he was or who he really was." Shinji lets out another sigh, "So… I thought… maybe I could ask him. I asked him if he really was my friend all those years ago."  
"不……我不恨。如果我恨的话，事情可能会简单些，但我并不恨，因为我无法理解。我不知道他为什么那样做，我不知道他是什么样的人，也不知道他真正的身份。" 真嗣又叹了口气，"所以……我想……也许我可以问问他。我问过他，那些年他是否真的是我的朋友。"

"And what was his reply?"  
"那他是怎么回答的？"

"He was actually honest with me." Shinji half smiles as he speaks, "He said he wasn't supposed to be my friend at first. He actually told me the truth, that he was sent to befriend me as part of his mission but as time went on his feelings changed."  
"他真的对我坦白了。" 真嗣半笑着说道，"他起初告诉我，他本不该成为我的朋友。他确实向我吐露了真相，说他被派来与我交友是出于任务需要，但随着时间的推移，他的感情发生了变化。"

"Yet he still betrayed you…" I try to hide the venom in my voice as I speak but I fear I am unable to do so.  
"然而他还是背叛了你…" 我试图掩饰声音中的怨恨，但恐怕未能成功。

"I know…. He tried to explain that as well. Mentioned his mission and that he was unable to stop it." Shinji shakes his head, "I… I didn't really understand it. He said he wanted to explain it all to me. He said he'd like another chance to be friends with me."  
"我知道…他也试图解释这一点。提到了他的任务，以及他无法阻止它。" 真嗣摇了摇头，"我…我其实不太明白。他说他想向我解释一切。他说他希望能有机会再次成为我的朋友。"

"What did you say?" "你说什么？"

Shinji looks at me, "I said no. I told him no and… then he hung up. I think I hurt him Rei, I actually upset him and made him cry. I did a bad thing."  
真嗣看着我，"我说了不。我告诉他不行，然后……他就挂了电话。我想我伤害了他，绫波，我真的让他难过，让他哭了。我做了件坏事。"

"No." I take Shinji's hand in both of mine, "You did not do a bad thing. You did what was right for you at the time. If you did not feel you were able to be friends with him then you were correct in telling him such a thing."  
"不。"我用双手握住真嗣的手，"你没有做坏事。你当时做了对你来说正确的事。如果你觉得无法和他做朋友，那么你告诉他这一点是正确的。"

"But he was crying Rei…"  
"但他哭了，丽……"

"Sometimes the truth can hurt a person." I reply, "Both me and you know this but a lie can hurt a person more."  
"有时候，真相会伤害一个人。" 我回答，"你我都知道这一点，但谎言可能伤害一个人更深。"

"I just…" Shinji lowered his eyes again, "Asuka wanted me to give him a chance and wanted us to be friends. I… I upset him and she's going to be angry at me because of it. I should have waited and figured things out, I shouldn't have rushed it like that."  
"我只是……" 真嗣再次垂下眼帘，"明日香希望我给他一个机会，希望我们能成为朋友。我……我让他难过了，她会因此生我的气。我本该等待，弄清楚情况，不该那么急躁。"

"What you could or should have done does not matter now. It has already been done." For a moment I wonder if my words were appropriate and will not just upset him more. I continue to speak, "What matter is how you move forward."  
"你本可以或应该做的事情现在已无关紧要。事情已经发生了。" 我一时怀疑我的话是否恰当，会不会让他更加难过。我继续说道："重要的是你如何向前迈进。"

"I don't know what to do now though…" Shinji replies, "Asuka is going to be angry at me."  
"我不知道现在该怎么办……" 真嗣回答，"明日香会生我的气。"

"No, she will not be angry. I am sure that Asuka will understand what has happened." I tell him, "She will see that it is a situation that can be resolved."  
"不，她不会生气的。我确信明日香会理解发生了什么。" 我告诉他，"她会明白这是一个可以解决的情况。"

"How though?" Shinji asks me, "I upset him, I doubt he'd want to speak to me again."  
"可是怎么才能做到呢？" 真嗣问我，"我惹恼了他，我怀疑他不会再想和我说话了。"

"I do not know, perhaps it is not a situation that can be resolved quickly." I reply, "Perhaps it is something that will take time for you both."  
"我不清楚，或许这不是一个能迅速解决的情况。" 我回答，"或许这是需要你们双方都花时间去处理的事情。"

"Do you think I should have forgiven him?"  
"你觉得我应该原谅他吗？"

"No. I do not, at least not until you learned the truth. Remember that Nagisa's actions did not just hurt you, he did not just betray you but he also put this planet at risk. Whilst he may have been acting under the influence of another he was still aware…"  
“不，我不能，至少在你了解真相之前不能。记住，渚的行为不仅伤害了你，他不仅背叛了你，还让这个星球陷入了危险。尽管他可能是在他人的影响下行动，但他仍然是有意识的……”

I trail off as I come to a sudden realization. Nagisa's situation is not a unique one, there has been another who has been in that position. That person is myself. I was under the influence of our father for many years, I lied about who I was and my actions hurt others and put this planet at risk.  
我话说到一半突然意识到。渚的处境并非独一无二，有一个人也曾处于那种境地。那个人就是我自己。我多年来一直受父亲的影响，我隐瞒了自己的真实身份，我的行为伤害了他人，也让这个星球面临风险。

I nearly betrayed them all for that scenario until the last minute when I decided to betray our father. Even than it was too late to truly stop things from happening. I could have stopped it sooner but I did not. Shinji and the others know all of this and they forgave me.  
我差点为了那个局面背叛了所有人，直到最后一刻才决定背叛父亲。即便如此，想要真正阻止事情发生已经太迟了。我本可以更早阻止这一切，但我没有。真嗣和其他人都知道这一切，他们原谅了我。

Myself and Nagisa, we are similar. I've condemned him despite myself being guilty of the same acts. I painted him as evil and manipulative and why? The only difference between he and I is that he could speak to people whilst I wasn't able to. Maybe I've always known this and that's why I condemn him so much. What if someone were to condemn me liken that though? Perhaps people already have done. The thought makes me feel sick.  
我和渚，我们很相似。尽管自己也有同样的过错，我却谴责了他。我将他描绘成邪恶且善于操纵人心的人，为什么呢？他和我唯一的区别在于，他能与人交流而我不能。或许我内心一直明白这一点，这就是我如此谴责他的原因。但如果有人那样谴责我呢？也许人们已经这样做了。这个想法让我感到恶心。

I let out a sigh of my own not quite know what I should say to Shinji. I have no words to say anymore. Instead I move over beside him and pull him into another hug.  
我也叹了口气，不太确定该对真嗣说什么。我已经无话可说。相反，我挪到他身边，再次将他拥入怀中。

"What should I do Rei?" I hear him ask me.  
“我该怎么办，绫波？”我听到他问我。

I do not know what advice I should give to my brother. I no longer feel I am qualified to give him advice regarding Nagisa considering how I myself have acted. Yet I feel I must say something, I want to help my brother be happy. I want to try to salvage this situation.  
我不知道该给我的兄弟什么建议。鉴于我自己的行为，我不再觉得自己有资格就渚的事情给他建议。然而，我觉得我必须说些什么，我想帮助我的兄弟快乐。我想尽力挽救这个局面。

"I believe… it would be worthwhile listening to what he has to say." I finally reply, "You do not have to do it now or this week but you should listen to him. You should explain to him why you feel you can't forgive him yet but you might be able to. You should be honest with him.  
“我相信……听他说说会有所帮助。”我终于回答道，“你不必现在或这周就做，但你应该听他说。你应该向他解释为什么你觉得自己还不能原谅他，但也许将来可以。你应该对他诚实。”

"Do you think he will understand?"  
“你觉得他会理解吗？”

I nod, "If he really does want forgiveness and to be friends with you again then yes… I do."  
我点头，“如果他真的想要得到宽恕并与你重归于好，那么是的……我愿意。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

God damn it, my hand hurts like hell! I close up the book and place it onto one of the piles near to me and wonder why the hell I agreed to do this. Up until now I've been so adamant about who I was as a writer. I've always made an effort to make sure there is no chance my pseudonym is revealed. I always said there would be no press appearances, no signings, no interviews and no social media. My publisher would release the book under the name I gave them and that was to be it.  
该死，我的手疼得要命！我合上书，将其放在旁边的一堆书上，不禁疑惑自己为何会同意做这件事。一直以来，我都非常坚持作为作家的自我定位。我总是努力确保我的笔名不会被揭露。我曾说过不会有媒体露面，不会签名售书，不会接受采访，也不会使用社交媒体。我的出版社会用我给他们的名字发布书籍，仅此而已。

Now, for some reason, I've agreed to sign five hundred copies of the first book and said that I'll sign five hundred copies of the second book too. So today I've been working through those copies of the first book. I had to come up with a signature for Mari Makinami, I figured something simple would do. It's not so much a signature really, more of a wiggly line with a smiley cat face above it.  
不知为何，现在我同意了为第一本书签五百本，并承诺也为第二本书签五百本。所以今天我一直在处理这些第一本书的签名。我得为真希波·真理奈设计一个签名，我想简单点就行。这其实不算真正的签名，更像是一条波浪线，上面画了个笑脸猫脸。

It's all Kaworu's fault. He was the one who persuaded me to do this. I was going to say no to the publisher when they suggested it. I was going to suggest giving an anonymous donation or something to the charity. Kaworu on the other hand said I should do it. He appealed to my ego by informing me how much people would love to have an item signed by my hand. He also appealed to my heart on mentioning how much good publicity it would be for the charity.  
这都是渚薰的错。是他劝我这么做的。出版社提出这个建议时，我原本打算拒绝。我本想建议匿名捐款或什么的给慈善机构。但渚薰却说，我应该接受。他先是激起了我的虚荣心，告诉我人们会多么喜欢拥有我亲笔签名的物品。接着又触动了我的内心，提到这对慈善机构会有多好的宣传效果。

What can I say, I have a soft spot for cheering up disadvantaged children. I can't imagine where that comes from. So I decided I'd do it, if it will genuinely help these children get the treatment they need not just physically but mentally then I want to help. I don't want there to be another child that grows up like I did out there.  
我该说什么呢，我对帮助那些处于不利地位的孩子感到特别心软。我无法想象这种情感从何而来。所以我决定，如果这真的能帮助这些孩子不仅在身体上，也在心理上得到治疗，那么我愿意伸出援手。我不希望再有孩子像我那样长大。

I let out a loud yawn as I lean back in my seat. I've been tired all day, I suppose that hasn't made things much easier. I'm not sure if I can blame Kaworu for my tiredness though, after all I was the one who initiated things. Still, as I think back, the tiredness I'm feeling now is totally worth it.  
我打了个大大的哈欠，靠在椅背上。今天一整天都很累，这无疑让事情变得更不容易。不过，我不确定能否把我的疲惫归咎于渚薰，毕竟是我主动开始的。尽管如此，回想起来，我现在感到的疲惫完全是值得的。

Kaworu made me feel good and the best thing is that for once feeling good like that hasn't been accompanied by the usual shame and guilt I always feel. Instead… I feel happy, I feel content. I can still remember every detail of it too, I can remember how his hands felt as they ran themselves over my body. I can remember how his fingers felt as he touched me. I can remember the warmth I got from him and how he felt in my hands.  
渚薰让我感觉很好，最棒的是，这种感觉竟然没有伴随着我一贯的羞耻和内疚。相反……我感到快乐，感到满足。我依然记得每一个细节，记得他的手在我身上游走时的触感，记得他的手指触碰我时的感觉，记得从他那里感受到的温暖，以及他在我手中的感觉。

I shudder and feel myself blush as my mind continues to wander. If that is how good that feels then I can't imagine how good it would feel to make love to him. I blush some more as I shake my head, what the hell is happening to me? I'm fantasizing about making love to Kaworu in the middle of the day. I've changed over these last few months. Those walls I kept up around me have slowly started to come down without me realizing it.  
我不禁颤抖，脸上泛起红晕，思绪继续飘荡。如果那种感觉已经如此美好，我无法想象与他真正相爱会是怎样的感受。我再次脸红，摇了摇头，我到底是怎么了？我居然在大白天幻想着与渚薰相爱。这几个月来，我变了。那些我一直以来坚守的壁垒，不知不觉间开始崩塌。

I don't dislike knowing that though. I always kept them up before I feared what would happen if I let them down but… it isn't so bad. I'm in a place I never thought I deserved to be. I'm actually happy with who I am and my life. I actually know that people are my friend and I… I'm falling in love… no… I've fell in love.  
但我不讨厌这种认知。以前我总是害怕，如果放下这些壁垒会发生什么，但……其实并没有那么糟糕。我身处一个从未觉得自己配得上的地方。我真正对自己和自己的生活感到满意。我真正知道人们是我的朋友，而我……我正在坠入爱河……不……我已经坠入爱河了。

I was never supposed to fall in love. I was never meant to let people in romantically. All that would happen is I'd get hurt by them. Yet I want to let Kaworu in, I want to let him in more. I want to continue to feel like this because I'm starting to realize that what Rei might actually have been right all those years. I am worth something and I do deserve to be happy.  
我本不该坠入爱河。我本不应在情感上让人靠近。那样只会让自己受伤。然而，我想要让渚薰进入我的生活，我想要让他更深入。我想要继续这样感受，因为我开始意识到，也许绫波这么多年来一直都是对的。我是有价值的，我值得幸福。

I get up from the seat and head into the kitchen to pour myself a drink, just as I do I hear the front door open. A moment later Kaworu enters the room, I barely get a chance to look at him as he moved past me and mutters a greeting. I watch as he takes off his jacket and throws it onto the couch and sets his bag down roughly on the floor.  
我从座位上起身，走向厨房给自己倒了一杯饮料，就在这时，我听到前门打开了。片刻后，渚薰走进房间，他匆匆经过我，低声打了个招呼。我看着他脱下外套，扔在沙发上，粗鲁地将包扔在地上。

I slowly make my way towards him wondering what it is that could have upset him. This was only his second week of teaching piano but I wonder if it could really have been something during one of his lessons. Last week he was speaking about how pleasant everyone was and besides, they're paying him for these private lessons it isn't as if he has a classroom full of people to manage.  
我缓缓向他走去，想知道是什么让他如此心烦。这仅仅是他的第二周教钢琴，但我怀疑是否真的与他的某节课有关。上周他还提到大家都很愉快，而且，他们付钱给他上私人课，他并不需要像管理一整个教室的人那样。

Perhaps then something has happened on the way home. I feel my chest tighten for a moment as my mind goes back to him being attacked a few weeks ago. It doesn't seem likely that he was attacked though, he didn't look hurt or anything when he got in, just upset.  
或许回家的路上发生了什么事。我感到胸口一紧，脑海中浮现出几周前他遭到袭击的情景。不过，他看起来并没有受伤，只是有些沮丧。

I carefully path around the stacks of books and stand near the edge of the sofa, "Kaworu... Is everything alright?"  
我小心翼翼地绕过成堆的书，站在沙发边缘，“薰... 一切都好吗？”

He turns to me and gives me a weak half-arsed smile, "It's fine, how was your day?"  
他转向我，给了我一个勉强的、半吊子的微笑，“没事，你今天过得怎么样？”

He immediately turns away and reaches for his bag and starts rummaging through it, I frown at him, "Kaworu..."  
他立刻转过身去，伸手去拿他的包，开始在里面翻找，我皱着眉头看着他，“薰……”

Kaworu ignores me as he pulls out his books and sheet music from the bag. He throws them down somewhat angrily onto the coffee table and opens one of the books. If he thinks I'm just going to accept that he's 'fine' he has another thing coming. I sit next to him and put my finger under the cover of the book and flip it shut.  
薰无视我，从包里拿出他的书和乐谱。他有些生气地将它们扔到咖啡桌上，打开其中一本书。如果他认为我会就这样接受他“没事”的说法，那他就大错特错了。我坐在他旁边，用手指抵住书皮，把它合上。

"Kaworu..." I then reach out with my hand and gently turn his head to face me, I can see his eyes widen as I narrow my own eyes at him, "Tell me what is wrong... or I'll..."  
“薰……” 我伸出手，轻轻地将他的头转向我，我能看到他的眼睛因我眯起眼睛而睁大，“告诉我哪里不对劲……否则我……”

I don't even get the opportunity to come up with some vaguely creative threat that I'd never seriously carry out before he replies to me, "I spoke to Shinji today!"  
我连想出一个略带创意、实际上绝不会实施的威胁的机会都没有，他就回复我了，“我今天和真嗣聊过了！”

I'm stunned into silence as I release my grip on Kaworu's chin. He turns and angrily opens his book again and gazes at the page. I take a moment to process what he has told me. Shinji... Shinji, you idiot! You absolute idiot! When I said you should speak to Kaworu I didn't mean you should call him straight away! You... You absolutely goddamn idiot!  
我震惊得哑口无言，松开了抓着渚薰下巴的手。他转过身，愤怒地再次打开书，凝视着页面。我需要时间来消化他告诉我的事情。真嗣...真嗣，你这个笨蛋！你这个彻头彻尾的笨蛋！当我告诉你应该和渚薰谈谈时，我并不是让你直接给他打电话！你...你这个该死的笨蛋！

"Oh... Did you?" I finally reply through gritted teeth.  
“哦...是吗？”我终于咬牙切齿地回答道。

Kaworu nods in frustration, "Yes, he called me this morning just after I had finished my first lesson. He said that... you told him to contact me."  
渚薰懊恼地点头，“是的，他今早刚上完我的第一节课就给我打电话了。他说……你让他联系我的。”

This is... new, I don't think I've heard Kaworu sound annoyed like this before, at least outside of when we're playing games anyway. I didn't really think it was possible for Kaworu to be angry like this. I watch for a moment as he flips a page of the book. It'd be amusing if I myself wasn't angry at this.  
这真是……新鲜，我以前还没听过渚薰这么生气，至少在我们玩游戏之外的时候没听过。我真没想到渚薰会这么生气。我看着他翻了一页书，如果我自己不生气的话，这情景还挺好笑的。

"Oh... Did he?" I make no attempt to hide my own annoyance at the situation, "And what exactly did Shinji have to say?"  
“哦……是吗？”我毫不掩饰自己对这情况的恼火，“那碇到底说了些什么？”

"He wanted to know if I was really human and I told him." Kaworu's voice sounds strained as he speaks, I can hear the anger in it but I can also hear his voice cracking, "I said to him I was and I tried to apologize for what happened. I... I asked him if I could explain things to him and if I might have another chance to be friends. He said no."  
"他想知道我是否真的是人类，我告诉他了。" 渚薰的声音听起来很紧张，我能听出他的愤怒，但也能听到他的声音在颤抖，"我告诉他我是，并试图为发生的事情道歉。我……我问他我是否可以向他解释一切，并请求再给我一次做朋友的机会。他说不行。"

Kaworu immediately drops his head as he says that last line and I see his other hand clench itself into a fist as he brings it down onto his knee. I feel my own anger subside as I reach out and place my hand onto Kaworu's leg and rub gently.  
渚薰说完最后一句话，立刻低下了头，我看到他的另一只手紧握成拳，重重地砸在膝盖上。我感到自己的怒气消退，伸出手放在渚薰的腿上，轻轻地揉着。

This is not how I had expected their first conversation to go nor how I wanted it to go. I also did not expect Shinji to contact Kaworu so soon after I suggested it. I was hoping that perhaps he would wait a day or two or even speak to me and Rei about it first. Damn it Shinji, why do you have to be impulsive at just the wrong moments?  
这并不是我预想中他们第一次对话的方式，也不是我希望的方式。我也没料到真嗣会在我提议后这么快就联系渚薰。我本以为他或许会等一两天，或者先和我们谈谈。该死的真嗣，为什么你总是在不恰当的时刻冲动行事？

"I think..." Kaworu finally looks up, "I think it would be best if I were to not go to Japan with you in December. I know it was your wish for me to be there and for me and Shinji to be friends but I fear that would not be possible. I am sorry but what I did appears to be unforgivable."  
"我想……" 渚薰终于抬起头，"我觉得最好还是不要在十二月和你一起去日本。我知道你希望我在那里，希望我和真嗣成为朋友，但我担心这不可能。我很抱歉，但我所做的事似乎是不可原谅的。"

"No." I squeeze his leg in comfort, "It isn't..."  
"不。" 我安慰地握紧他的腿，"不是这样的……"

"Yes." Kaworu turns to look at me, "It is, I am sorry but I was a fool to think I could be forgiven. I hurt Shinji with my actions. I didn't just hurt him, I betrayed him when he had nothing, I offered him friendship and then took it away from him. I do not deserve his forgiveness, I'm angry at myself for even thinking I did."  
"是的。" 渚薰转向我，"确实是这样，我很抱歉，我真是个傻瓜，以为自己能被原谅。我的行为伤害了真嗣。我不仅伤害了他，还在他一无所有的时候背叛了他，我给了他友谊，然后又夺走了它。我不配得到他的原谅，我对自己竟然还抱有这种想法感到愤怒。"

"Kaworu, you can't..." I try to speak softly to calm him down.  
"渚薰，你不能..." 我试图轻声细语以安抚他。"

"No!" He interrupts me, "I shouldn't have deluded myself into thinking I."  
"不！" 他打断了我，"我不该自欺欺人地以为我..."

"Stop it!" It's my turn to cut him off sharply, "Just stop it! You aren't deluded and you will be coming to Japan with me!"  
"住口！" 轮到我严厉地打断他，"别再说了！你并没有自欺欺人，而且你会跟我一起去日本的！"

"But he hates me!" Kaworu snaps back, "If I'm there with you then all I'll do is end up doing is causing more pain for him. I'll just be a distraction. I don't want to hurt him any more than I have done!"  
“但他恨我！” 渚薰厉声回道，“如果我跟你在一起，我只会给他带来更多痛苦。我只会是个干扰。我不想再伤害他了，我已经做得够多了！”

Damn it Shinji, just what the hell did you say to Kaworu to make him act like this? What the hell did Kaworu say to you for this to happen? I thought you were going to hear him out and talk to him properly so what caused this? Did you just jump in without thinking? Is that it? No matter what Kaworu tells me I know you don't hate him, I know you wanted to mend this. I could hear it in your voice when I spoke to you, I know how the two of you feel about each other!  
该死的，真嗣，你到底对渚薰说了什么让他这样反应？渚薰又对你说了什么导致这一切？我以为你会听他说，好好跟他谈，是什么导致了这种情况？你是不是没想清楚就冲动行事了？是那样吗？无论渚薰告诉我什么，我知道你并不恨他，我知道你想修复这段关系。我跟你说话时能听出你的声音，我知道你们俩对彼此的感情！

I put my arm around Kaworu and remain silent as I try to figure out just how to fix this. At the same time, the last thought I had rings through my head. It's true, I do know exactly how Kaworu feels about Shinji and I know how Shinji feels about him as well. It's the same thing that did feel for Shinji and it's the thing that I feel for Kaworu right now. Love, it is love that I feel for Kaworu and it is love that they have for one another.  
我搂住渚薰，沉默不语，试图找出解决办法。与此同时，我脑海中回响着最后一个念头。没错，我确实知道渚薰对真嗣的感情，也知道真嗣对他的感情。这和我对真嗣的感情是一样的，也是我现在对渚薰的感情。爱，我对渚薰的感情是爱，他们彼此之间也是爱。

The thought of it frightens me and there is a darker part of me that thinks that maybe I should embrace and maybe even encourage this division. Maybe I should just let Kaworu give up on attaining forgiveness from Shinji and maybe I should tell Shinji to not try to contact Kaworu. If I do… then I get to keep Kaworu, I get to stay happy and I don't have to fear the inevitable. Let's be honest, Shinji is a much better person than I could ever hope to be.  
想到这一点，我感到害怕，内心深处有个更阴暗的声音认为，或许我应该接受甚至鼓励这种分裂。也许我应该让渚薰放弃从真嗣那里获得原谅，也许我应该告诉真嗣不要试图联系渚薰。如果我这么做……那么我就能留住渚薰，我就能保持快乐，我就不必害怕那不可避免的事。老实说，真嗣是一个比我所能期望的更好的人。

That part of me is still waiting for what it thinks is inevitable. For Kaworu to realize the so-called truth and abandon me. It was there from the beginning of our friendship and as we've grown closer it's continued to be there.  
那个部分的我仍在等待它认为不可避免的事情。等待渚薰意识到所谓的真相并抛弃我。从我们友谊开始的那一刻起，它就存在了，随着我们关系的加深，它一直都在。

No, I can't let myself think things like that. I can't continue to see myself as that person anymore. I'm not that person. I'm not the Asuka I was all those years ago. I'm not a bad person and I'm not going to suddenly transform into that.  
不，我不能让自己再这样想了。我不能再继续把自己看作那样的人。我不是那个人。我不是多年前那个明日香。我不是坏人，也不会突然变成那样。

As for Kaworu, I shouldn't fear him suddenly leaving me. I know he won't leave me like that. I know his feelings for me are true. I know how he feels for me. Besides… I have to help fix this, it's my fault it happened in the first place. I don't really know how to fix it but I will.  
至于渚薰，我不该害怕他会突然离开我。我知道他不会那样离开我。我知道他对我的感情是真挚的。我知道他对我的感觉。此外…我必须帮忙解决这个问题，毕竟一开始就是我的错。我不太清楚如何修复，但我会尽力。

I let out a sigh, I guess I need to know more, "Look… This can be fixed, just… start from the beginning. Tell me exactly what happened."  
我叹了口气，我想我需要了解更多，“听着…这可以解决，只是…从头开始。告诉我究竟发生了什么。”

He closes his book in irritation, "I don't see what the point is he…"  
他不悦地合上书，“我不明白这有什么意义…”

"Just humour me Kaworu." "就迁就我一下吧，薰。"

"Okay." He nods, "I finished my first lesson and then after it I got a phonecall. I answered it and it was Shinji, he said you gave him my number and told him to contact me."  
"好的。"" 他点头，""我完成了第一课，然后接到了一个电话。我接了，是真嗣打来的，他说你把我的号码给了他，让他联系我。"

"Yes, that is true." I nod as I reply, not making much of an effort to hide my own annoyance, "I said that he should speak to you. I didn't… think he'd do it right away though."  
"没错，是我说的。"" 我点头回应，并未费心掩饰自己的不悦，""我告诉他应该和你谈谈。但我没想到……他会这么快就打来。"

"You didn't?" Kaworu asks me.  
"你没这么做？" 渚薰问我。

"Of course not!" I shake my head, "I only suggested it to him and said it'd be good if he spoke to you about what had happened. I had told him we were friends and figured that it'd be good for you both to speak before we go over there! I thought that maybe he'd use his brain and talk to others first or take the time to think about it."  
"当然没有！" 我摇摇头，"我只是向他提议，并说如果他能和你谈谈发生的事情会很好。我告诉他我们是朋友，认为在我们去那里之前你们俩先谈谈会比较好！我以为他可能会动动脑子，先和其他人谈谈或者花点时间思考一下。"

"I see." Kaworu leans back in the seat, "That does explain why he was struggling for something to say."  
"我明白了。" 渚薰向后靠在座位上，"这确实解释了为什么他当时在努力找话说。"

"So…" I pause for a moment, "Shinji asked you if you were human and you said yes. Then what?"  
"那么…" 我顿了一下，"真嗣问你是不是人类，你说是。然后呢？"

"I told him I was, he seemed to accept that." Kaworu explains, "After that he… didn't really say anything else so I tried to tell him things about me."  
"我告诉他我是，他似乎接受了这一点。" 渚薰解释道，"之后他…就没再说什么了，所以我试着告诉他一些关于我的事情。"

Kaworu leans forward again and idly plays with the corner of the book, "I didn't really know where to start. There is a lot about me he didn't know and it's hard to organize it all when you're put on the spot like that."  
渚薰再次向前倾身，随意地摆弄着书角，"我不知道该从何说起。关于我，他不知道的事情太多了，当你像那样被突然问到时，很难把一切都组织好。"

I move my hand to his back and rub it gently, "So what did you tell him?"  
我将手移到他的背上，轻轻揉着，“那你告诉他什么了？”

Kaworu shrugs, "I told him that I had a mission and that part of that mission was to befriend him. I… I said I'd like to tell him more and then I apologized to him again for what I did and what I put him through."  
渚薰耸耸肩，“我告诉他我有一个任务，其中一部分就是与他成为朋友。我……我说我想告诉他更多，然后再次为我的所作所为以及给他带来的困扰向他道歉。”

"And then what?" “然后呢？”

"I asked him if…" Kaworu pauses for a moment and I see his angry demenour start to drop. He takes a moment to compose himself and I ready myself for what will happen next, "I asked maybe it would be possible to be friends again. I said that I'd like to explain everything to him about who I was and what I was. I… I asked him to be honest.  
"我问他是否…" 渚薰顿了一下，我看到他愤怒的神情开始消退。他深吸一口气，整理情绪，我则准备好迎接接下来可能发生的事，"我问或许我们有可能重新成为朋友。我说我想向他解释一切，关于我是谁，我是什么。我…我请求他诚实相待。

Kaworu turns to me at this point as he speaks, his voice becoming more ragged with each word. I watch as a tear slowly starts to trickle down his cheek. I reach up and gently wipe it away with my thumb. I'm slowly starting to see where things might have gone wrong now.  
说到这里，渚薰转向我，每说一个字，声音都变得更加沙哑。我看着一滴泪缓缓滑过他的脸颊。我伸出手，用拇指轻轻拭去那滴泪。我开始慢慢明白事情可能在哪里出了差错。

I remain quiet as once again Kaworu begins to speak, "He said… he was sorry but he couldn't…"  
我保持沉默，渚薰再次开口，"他说…他很抱歉，但他做不到…"

Another tear falls down his cheek and I wrap an arm around him and pull him close to me. I run my hand through his hair, "I… I couldn't stand to hear him say anything else so I just told him he didn't have to explain and then I ended the call."  
又一滴泪水滑落他的脸颊，我伸出一只手臂环绕着他，将他拉近我。我用手轻抚他的头发，“我……我无法忍受再听他说下去，所以我只是告诉他不必解释，然后就挂断了电话。”

"It's alright." I say softly as I continue to run my hand through his hair. I'm still trying to figure out how I can solve this. I didn't their first conversation to happen like this. I'm not so stupid as to expect it to be resolved in one day but I certainly didn't expect this.  
“没事的。”我轻声说道，继续抚摸着他的头发。我仍在思考如何解决这个问题。我不希望他们的第一次对话以这种方式发生。我并不愚蠢到期待一天之内就能解决，但我确实没预料到这种情况。

"Did you try to call him back afterwards?" I ask Kaworu out of curiosity.  
“之后你尝试回拨给他了吗？”出于好奇，我问川口。

I feel him shake his head, "No… I felt that he would not want to speak to me so I thought it would be better for me to focus on the rest of my day."  
我感觉他在摇头，“不……我觉得他可能不想跟我说话，所以我想还是专注于度过这一天比较好。”

"And… Shinji didn't try to call you again either, did he?" I ask, just to make sure.  
“而且……真嗣也没有再试图联系你，对吧？”我问道，只是为了确认一下。

"No, which confirmed to me that he did not wish to speak to me." Kaworu answers.  
“没有，这让我更加确信他不想跟我说话。”渚薰回答道。

I nod, it's not too dissimilar to how I've acted in the past. Not getting in contact because I thought they wouldn't want to speak to me and then having that theory confirmed by them not contacting me. I know Shinji, he'll probably have been feeling the same thing. I know… I know he wants to fix this. He'll be regretting what happened just as much as Kaworu.  
我点头，这与我过去的做法并无太大不同。因为我认为他们不想和我说话而不联系，然后通过他们不联系我来证实这一猜想。我了解真嗣，他可能也有同样的感觉。我知道……我知道他想修复这段关系。他会像渚一样后悔所发生的事。

I have to fix this. I can't let the same thing that happened to me and Shinji happen to these two. I can't let them repeat my mistake. I'm not going to let them both spend five years wondering about the other. This has to be resolved.  
我必须解决这个问题。我不能让同样的事情发生在我和真嗣身上，再次发生在他们两人身上。我不能让他们重蹈我的覆辙。我不会让他们俩都花五年时间去猜测对方。这件事必须得到解决。

I feel Kaworu shift himself, he looks me in the eye, all the annoyance of before is now gone. He looks almost puppy like in his sadness, "So you understand, I cannot go to Japan now. I would be…"  
我感觉渚动了动，他直视我的眼睛，之前的恼怒已经消失无踪。他看起来几乎像只小狗一样悲伤，“所以你明白，我现在不能去日本。我会……”

I place my hand on his chin and lean in quickly to kiss him on the lips in an effort to silence him. I pull away and stare deeply into his eyes and let myself smile, "Kaworu… You are going to come to Japan with me. I'll speak to Rei later on and find out what is happening to Shinji. I'll set it up so you can explain things to him properly at the very least."  
我把手放在他的下巴上，迅速倾身吻上他的唇，试图让他安静下来。我退开，深深地凝视着他的眼睛，让自己微笑，“薰…你要跟我一起去日本。我会稍后和丽谈谈，弄清楚真嗣的情况。我会安排好，至少你能好好向他解释一切。”

"What if you can't do that? What if he doesn't want to?"  
“如果你做不到呢？如果他不愿意呢？”

"Kaworu…" I kiss him again, "I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I can do anything."  
“薰…”我又吻了他一次，“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我无所不能。”

"T-Thank you…" He finally smiles and then he leans in to kiss me. His lips meet mine and my mouth parts slightly to allow my tongue to explore his mouth. I feel his hand rest itself on my side and I allow him to carefully position himself on top of me on the couch. I smile up at him as he pulls away and looks at me, "I… I am so thankful to you Asuka. I don't know what I would have done these past few months without you. I just… I want a chance to explain things to him and say I'm sorry."  
"谢谢你……" 他终于笑了，然后倾身吻我。他的唇触碰到我的，我的嘴微微张开，让我的舌头探索他的口腔。我感觉到他的手放在我的腰侧，我让他小心翼翼地将自己置于我上方，躺在沙发上。他退开时，我对他微笑，"我……我非常感激你，明日香。我不知道过去这几个月没有你我会怎么办。我只是……我想有机会向他解释并道歉。"

"I know Kaworu…" I nod, "And I'll make sure you get that. What happened today… I made a mistake in telling him to contact you. I should have expected him to do that but… it can be fixed."  
"我知道，薰……" 我点头，"我会确保你得到这个机会。今天发生的事……我告诉他联系你是个错误。我本该预料到他会这么做，但……这可以补救。"

"I hope so. Again, thank you… thank you Asuka. I… I love you, from the bottom of my heart."  
"希望如此。再次感谢你……谢谢你，明日香。我……我全心全意地爱你。"

For a brief moment I'm actually stunned into silence by his words. I feel the sensation of butterflies in my stomach. He… He loves me and… he actually said it. I feel myself grin as I wrap one arm around him and run my free hand along his side, "I love you too Kaworu."  
有那么一瞬间，我被他的话惊得哑口无言。我感到胃里一阵蝴蝶飞舞的感觉。他……他爱我，而且……他真的说出来了。我笑着用一只手臂环抱住他，空着的手抚摸着他的侧身，“我也爱你，渚薰。”

**1st October 2021 - Rei Ayanami  
2021 年 10 月 1 日 - 绫波零**

I sit up and move the curtain to one side to gaze up at the moon. It is bright in the sky tonight, it is a beautiful sight and yet the is something disturbing about it. The brightness of the moon has also put emphasis on the streak of red that now crosses over it. As the years have gone on this streak has faded, it was at its worst when it just after Third Impact, now it is duller and it may one day go completely.  
我坐起身，拉开窗帘仰望月亮。今晚的月亮在天空中格外明亮，美丽非凡，却又似乎有些令人不安。月亮的亮度也突显了横跨其上的一道红色痕迹。随着时间的流逝，这道痕迹逐渐淡去，最严重的时候是在第三次冲击刚过后，如今它已变得暗淡，也许有一天会完全消失。

In a way I hope it doesn't, that blood red streak, as haunting as it is for me also serves as a reminder of what was avoided. There are of course more reminders on this earth, the red waters around Tokyo-3 and the city itself but the streak is one that all of humanity can see, no matter where in the world.  
某种程度上，我希望它不会消失，那道血红色的痕迹，对我来说既令人不安又是一种提醒，提醒我们避免了什么。当然，地球上还有更多的警示，比如东京-3 周围的红水和城市本身，但这条痕迹是全人类都能看到的，无论身处世界的哪个角落。

I can still remember that day so vividly, I remember standing in front of Lilith and hearing it call out to me. I remember the commander appearing and telling me it was time and then I heard the scream of Shinji. He was in such pain and in that brief moment I knew exactly what it was I had to do. I had to ease that pain, I had to stop his suffering.  
我至今仍能如此清晰地记得那一天，我记得站在莉莉丝面前，听到它呼唤我。我记得指挥官出现并告诉我时候到了，然后我听到了真嗣的尖叫。他如此痛苦，在那一刻我清楚地知道我必须做什么。我必须减轻他的痛苦，我必须阻止他的苦难。

I took Adam from the commander into myself and the unholy union of Adam and Lilith was complete. I would become akin to a god and let Shinji dictate the future of this world. Through this we were able to avert the loss of all mankind. It was not a simple process but I had faith that Shinji would make the right decision.  
我从指挥官那里接过亚当，将其融入自己，亚当与莉莉丝的邪恶结合就此完成。我将变得近乎神明，并让真嗣决定这个世界的未来。通过这种方式，我们成功避免了全人类的灭亡。这个过程并不简单，但我相信真嗣会做出正确的选择。

I close the curtain and look at the clock. It is now three in the morning, I came into my bedroom at half eleven with the intention of going to sleep. I thought that I would have no difficulties but since I came into my room the exhaustion that I had been feeling has now faded. It has been replaced by an energy that is fueled by the thoughts circling in my mind.  
我拉上窗帘，看了一眼时钟。现在是凌晨三点，我十一点半走进卧室，本打算睡觉。我原以为不会有困难，但自从我进房间以来，那种疲惫感已经消退。取而代之的是一种由脑海中不断盘旋的思绪所驱动的能量。

I find myself to be concerned for Shinji. Over the course of the evening his sadness at the events of the day did not fade. If anything, it just seemed to grow. I wish I could have helped him, I made an attempt to reassure him that things would be find but my attempts were a failure.  
我不禁为真嗣担心。整个晚上，他对当天事件的悲伤并未消散。甚至，似乎愈发加深。我多希望能帮到他，我尝试安慰他，告诉他一切都会好起来，但我的努力失败了。

It is both disheartening and frustrating in equal measures. I wish that things could be so simple that they were able to be repaired in one evening. I know that the truth is things are rarely ever that easy. I told him so much myself. I told him that the situation between himself and Nagisa was not one that'd be quick to repair. Yet I find myself unable to accept my own words.  
这既令人沮丧又令人沮丧。我希望事情能简单到一夜之间就能修复。我知道事实是，事情很少那么容易。我曾亲口告诉他这些。我告诉他，他和渚之间的关系不是那种能迅速修复的。然而，我发现我无法接受自己的话。

This situation with Nagisa is an eye opening one for me. It is forcing me to face memories and thoughts that I had locked away after I returned. I have, up until now, tried to think very little about what my role in the world was at that time. There have been many an occasion where I have been unable to do this, in those times I have been fortunate to have Asuka or Shinji to turn to.  
与渚薰的这段经历对我来说是一次醒悟。它迫使我面对那些回归后被我封存的记忆和思绪。一直以来，我尽量不去思考自己在那个时期的世界中扮演的角色。很多时候我无法做到这一点，幸好那时有明日香或真嗣可以依靠。

When I look back on those times I see exactly what I was. I was a victim. Gendo Ikari brought me into this world not to be a person but to serve a purpose. The fact that I resembled a person mattered little to him, if anything it helped him develop his scenario. I was raised to not challenge my role in life, I was kept isolated and told that my only purpose was to keep to the scenario.  
当我回顾那些时光，我清楚地看到了自己是什么。我是一个受害者。碇源堂将我带入这个世界，不是为了让我成为一个人，而是为了实现一个目的。我是否像一个人对他来说无关紧要，甚至这有助于他完善他的计划。我被培养成不质疑自己在生活中的角色，我被隔离，被告知唯一的目的是遵循那个计划。

Shinji arrived one day and slowly my life changed. I started to see value in myself beyond being a puppet. Shortly afterwards Asuka arrived and we became a team. Thanks to her I also started to question my role in life, I started to realize that maybe what I wanted did matter.  
真嗣有一天来到了这里，我的生活慢慢发生了变化。我开始看到自己超越傀儡的价值。不久之后，明日香也来了，我们成为了一个团队。多亏了她，我也开始质疑自己在生活中的角色，我开始意识到也许我想要的确实重要。

Nagisa, you are the same as I am, aren't you? You were a being brought up to serve a particular purpose and not question your role. Unlike me you were unable to go against your role though. Maybe that is why I think I hate you, because you were unable to do what I did. How could you have done that though? You aren't me and you didn't have the same experiences I did.  
渚，你和我一样，不是吗？你是一个被培养来服务于特定目的的存在，不会质疑自己的角色。但与我不一样的是，你无法反抗你的角色。也许这就是为什么我认为我恨你，因为你做不到我所做的事。但你怎么可能做到呢？你不是我，也没有经历过我所经历的一切。

Perhaps it is not just Shinji who should speak to Nagisa, perhaps I should speak to him as well. Since I have heard of his return I have done nothing but warn and be angry about him but I have not reached out to communicate with him to learn the truth. When others returned and saw me, they did not act that way towards me, they spoke to me and learned the truth of things. I owe Nagisa that same courtesy, I should be the one to speak to him.  
或许不仅仅是真嗣应该和渚谈谈，也许我也应该和他谈谈。自从听说他回来后，我除了警告和生气之外什么都没做，却没有主动去沟通了解真相。当其他人回来见到我时，他们并没有那样对待我，而是和我交谈，了解事情的真相。我应该给渚同样的礼遇，我应该主动和他谈谈。

I want to help to fix this situation between Shinji and Nagisa. I know that Asuka will want to fix it as well. As it is she is the only one out of all of us who knows the truth about Nagisa. She has tried to tell me before but I was unwilling to listen. I am willing to listen now, only I want to hear it from him. Perhaps if I know the truth myself then I can help Shinji to understand.  
我想帮助解决真嗣和渚之间的问题。我知道明日香也会想解决这个问题。她是唯一一个知道渚真相的人。她之前试图告诉我，但我当时不愿意听。现在我愿意听了，只是我想从他那里听到真相。也许如果我自己了解了真相，我就能帮助真嗣理解。

I pull up my phone to see what time it is in Germany. It is not too late over there and I know Asuka isn't the sort to go to bed early. I just hope that I am not interrupting anything between her and Nagisa. I know that with them starting a romantic relationship it is likely I might call them in the middle of certain activities. Still, I need to do this now, otherwise I will not sleep tonight.  
我掏出手机查看德国的时间。那边还不算太晚，我知道明日香不是那种早睡的人。我只希望没有打扰到她和渚之间的什么事情。我知道他们刚开启一段浪漫关系，很可能我打电话时他们正在某些活动中。不过，我现在必须这么做，否则今晚我肯定睡不着。

I select Asuka's contact card and hold the phone to my ear. I hear the phone ring for a short while before she picks up, her voice sounds panicked, "Rei? Is everything alright? It's early in the morning over there isn't it?"  
我选择了明日香的联系人卡片，将手机贴在耳边。电话响了一会儿她才接起，她的声音听起来很慌张，“丽？一切都好吗？你们那边还是清晨吧？”

"Yes, everything is fine." I reply, "I am calling about the situation between Nagisa and Shinji?"  
“是的，一切都好。”我回答，“我打电话是想谈谈渚和真嗣之间的情况？”

"Well, nothing like getting straight to the point." I hear her laugh, "I was actually going to call you tomorrow morning about it. Look… It seems like I'm saying this sort of thing a lot lately but I'm sorry. I was the one who told Shinji to contact Nagisa."  
"哎，开门见山总是好的。" 我听到她笑了，"其实我本来打算明天早上给你打电话说这事的。你看……最近我好像一直在说这种话，但真的很抱歉。是我让真嗣联系渚的。"

"Yes, I know." I say, "I do not believe you are to blame for this situation."  
"是的，我知道。" 我说，"我不认为这是你的错。"

"I just didn't expect him to go straight ahead and do it. I thought that maybe he would…"  
"我只是没想到他会直接去做。我以为他可能会……"

I finish her sentence for her, "Consult myself or Misato first?"  
我替她接完话，“先咨询我还是美里？”

"Yes." Asuka confirms, "Of maybe he would talk to me a bit more about it."  
“是的。”明日香确认道，“或许他会多和我谈谈这件事。”

"But he did not do that…"  
“但他没有这么做……”

"No… He didn't do that… I'm just used to him being more hesitant about things."  
"不…他没有那样做…我只是习惯了他在事情上更加犹豫不决。"

I smile, "You know what Shinji can be like…"  
我微笑道，“你知道真嗣是什么样的…”

"Yeah… I know!" I hear her sigh, "I know damn well what he can be like. I know he probably thought it'd be better to do it right away. I know he probably thought that since I asked him to he should do it right away. God knows I demanded he do things right away when I lived with him, so why wouldn't he think that?"  
"是啊…我知道！"我听到她叹气，"我太清楚他能是什么样了。我知道他可能觉得立刻做会更好。我知道他可能觉得既然我要求了他就应该立刻去做。天知道我跟他住在一起时要求他立刻做事，所以他怎么会不这么想呢？"

"It is not your fault he did this." I make an effort to reassure her, whilst what she is saying has some truth to it I do not believe Shinji contacted Nagisa right away before of those memories. I just think it was an unfortunately thing, "Who or what is to blame does not matter now. What matters is that we resolved this. Shinji is upset by what happened. He fear that he will also have upset you, I assume that is not the case."  
"这不是你的错，他这么做。" 我努力安慰她，尽管她的话有些道理，我不认为真嗣在联系渚之前是因为那些记忆。我只是觉得这是一件不幸的事情，"现在谁或什么该受责备并不重要。重要的是我们解决了这个问题。真嗣对发生的事情感到不安。他担心自己也会让你不高兴，我猜情况并非如此。"

"Urgh, that idiot!" Asuka snaps back, "Of course that isn't the case! Does he really think that?"  
"呃，那个白痴！" 明日香回击道，"当然不是那样！他真的这么想吗？"

"Yes he does." "是的，他确实这么想。"

"Yeah… Of course he does. I do feel bad for Kaworu but I'm not exactly angry at Shinji. It's not like I expected this to be an instant fix, I just didn't think it'd go this bad."  
"是啊……当然他会这样。我确实为渚感到难过，但我并没有对真嗣生气。我并不指望这能立刻解决，我只是没想到会变得这么糟。"

"Was Nagisa upset?" I ask.  
""渚生气了吗？"" 我问道。

"He was upset enough that he has said it'd be best if he didn't come to Japan in December." Asuka tells me, "I told him that he will definitely be coming to Japan."  
"他气得都说最好别在十二月来日本了。"" 明日香告诉我，""我告诉他，他肯定得来日本。"

"I see." I pause for a moment to take in this new information. I was not aware that Nagisa was intending to visit Japan in December. I feel like perhaps I should have expected it to do the ongoing romance between Asuka and Nagisa. This does complicate matters slightly, before knowing this I believe we had a good quantity of time to resolve the problem.  
"我明白了。" 我停顿了一下，消化这个新信息。我之前并不知道渚计划在十二月去日本。考虑到明日香和渚之间持续的恋情，我本该预料到的。这确实让事情变得稍微复杂了，因为在此之前，我认为我们有足够的时间来解决问题。

I was hoping to speak to him a couple of times over the next few weeks before getting him and Shinji to speak again. I will have to accelerate that process now. I am confident we can resolve the situation but I am unsure if we can do it by then. If not then where will that leave things for the concert?  
我原本希望在未来几周内和他谈几次，然后再让他和真嗣重新对话。现在我不得不加快这个进程。我有信心我们能解决这个情况，但我不确定我们能否在那之前做到。如果不能，那音乐会的事情会怎么样呢？

"What if we are unable to resolve this by then?" I ask Asuka.  
"如果我们到那时还无法解决这个问题怎么办？" 我问明日香。

"Hah!" Asuka laughs, "Of course we will be able to resolve it! With the two of us guiding them we can't possibly fail! We just need to get the two of them to actually think about things properly."  
"哈哈！" 明日香笑着说，"当然我们能解决！有我们两个引导他们，绝不可能失败！我们只需要让他们真正好好思考问题。"

Her reply gives me some confidence and I allow myself to smile, "Okay, I'll speak to Shinji in the morning. There is something I wanted to ask you though."  
她的回答让我有了些信心，我让自己微笑起来，"好的，我明早会和真嗣谈谈。不过，我还有件事想问你。"

"Sure, what is it?" "当然，什么事？"

"I… would like to speak to Nagisa myself." I make my request, "I feel I have been unfair towards him, and I would like to further understand who he is and also apologize to him."  
"我…想亲自和渚谈谈。" 我提出请求，"我觉得自己对他不公平，我想更了解他，并向他道歉。"

"Apologize?" Asuka replies in confusion, "Rei, you haven't said anything to him. You have nothing to apologize for."  
"道歉？" 明日香困惑地回答，"丽，你没对他说过什么。你没什么需要道歉的。"

"Yeah I know." I say, "But I have said unpleasant things about him to yourself and I have not giving him a chance. I feel he should know of this and I should apologize."  
"是啊，我知道。" 我说，"但我对你说过他的坏话，也没给他机会。我觉得他应该知道这些，我应该向他道歉。"

"Okay fine. I'll speak to him tomorrow and get him to phone you. Is that good?"  
"好吧，行。我明天会和他谈谈，让他给你打电话。这样可以吗？"

"Yes, that would be fine. Thank you Asuka. I hope you have a good evening."  
"是的，那样就好。谢谢你，明日香。希望你晚上过得愉快。"

"Yeah, I will. Sleep well Rei."  
"嗯，我会的。晚安，丽。"

### Chapter 14: Suitable Grounds For The Blues  
第十四章：忧郁的适宜之地  

**1st October 2021 – Kozou Fuyutsuki  
2021 年 10 月 1 日 – 冬月耕作**

Many years ago there was a young man who had a dream of changing the world. This young man grew up wanting to leave his mark on the world in some way. Yet, the reality was, as his life went on he found himself unable to achieve such a grand dream. Yet, this desire remained, he turned to teaching in hopes that he might be able to encourage and inspire others to change the world in some way.  
多年前，有一个年轻人梦想着改变世界。这个年轻人长大后渴望以某种方式在世界上留下自己的印记。然而，现实是，随着他的人生继续，他发现自己无法实现如此宏大的梦想。尽管如此，这种渴望依然存在，他转向教育，希望自己能够鼓励和激励他人以某种方式改变世界。

As a teacher and as more years went by he found that he was still no closer to achieving this goal. He found himself unable to connect with his students and found he developed a reputation for taking his role too seriously.  
作为一名教师，随着岁月的流逝，他发现自己仍未接近实现这一目标。他发现自己无法与学生建立联系，并发现自己因过于认真对待自己的角色而声名狼藉。

The day came when that changed, he met a student, a brilliant student who shone above all the others and struck a chord with him. She would be the instrument that would allow him to make his mark on the world. Her work was brilliant, her theories sound and so he set about encouraging her as best he could. He would allow her access to the best resources and facilities he could.  
直到有一天，这一切发生了改变，他遇到了一个学生，一个才华横溢的学生，她的光芒盖过了所有人，并触动了他的心弦。她将成为他在这个世界上留下印记的工具。她的作品卓越，理论扎实，于是他尽其所能地鼓励她。他会让她接触到他能提供的最好的资源和设施。

Over time he realized that it was no longer about wanting to leave his mark on the world, he had fallen in love with her. All of his dreams of changing the world had fallen and been replaced by dreams of being with her. Only this was not to be, for this student's heart belonged to another.  
随着时间的推移，他意识到这不再是为了在世界留下自己的印记，他爱上了她。他改变世界的所有梦想都已破灭，取而代之的是与她在一起的梦想。只是这不可能实现，因为这个学生的芳心已属于他人。

Time passed and she left to carry on her work elsewhere. She was recruited by an organization that took a large amount of interest in her work. There were rumours regarding the nature of the organization and her connection to them but they did not matter to the man and he went back to his life of teaching.  
时光流逝，她离开去别处继续她的工作。她被一个对她的研究极为感兴趣的组织招募。关于这个组织的性质和她与他们的联系，有各种传言，但这些对那个男人来说并不重要，他继续着他的教学生涯。

Shortly afterwards, on September 13th 2000 the world changed. A global cataclysm that was termed the Second Impact tore the world asunder. Over the next couple of years billions lost their lives, war and famine raged and the man would learn of his own minor role in the tragedy.  
不久之后，2000 年 9 月 13 日，世界发生了巨变。被称为第二次冲击的全球性灾难撕裂了世界。接下来的几年里，数十亿人丧生，战争和饥荒肆虐，男人将得知自己在这一悲剧中的微小角色。

He would learn that the student that he had fallen and the organization she worked for would be central figures in this event. He would learn that by some cruel twist of fate he had in fact succeeded in his goal of changing the world, only that success tasted bitter as he saw the true costs of that change.  
他会得知，他曾爱慕的学生和她所在的组织将成为这一事件的核心人物。他会得知，命运的残酷捉弄下，他实际上已经实现了改变世界的目标，只是这份成功尝起来苦涩，因为他目睹了这一改变的真实代价。

He could not help himself and ended up falling for her again. She convinced him that what she was a part of was for the best. She confided in him her plans for the future. She told him that soon she would have to leave and asked him for one simple favour. She wanted him to watch over the people that mattered most to her, her husband and her son.  
他情不自禁，又一次为她倾心。她让他相信，她所参与的一切都是为了最好。她向他吐露了未来的计划。她告诉他，不久她将不得不离开，并请求他做一件简单的事。她希望他能守护对她最重要的人，她的丈夫和她的儿子。

I, Kozou Fuyutsuki, am that man and I failed in what I was asked to do. I failed to watch over the people she asked me to. I failed Yui by allowing myself to retreat into the darkness. I allowed myself to fall for your husbands ideas and believe that maybe I could see you one more time but this time we could be together.  
我，藤崎浩司，就是那个人，我未能完成她所托付的任务。我未能守护她让我照顾的人。我辜负了唯，让自己退缩到黑暗中。我让自己沉溺于你丈夫的想法，相信也许我能再见你一面，但这一次我们可以在一起。

I was weak and a coward. I should have stopped him, I should have put a stop to his plans right at the very beginning but I couldn't bring myself to do so. Opportunity after opportunity would present itself to me but I could not bring myself to take any of them.  
我软弱且胆怯。我本该阻止他，本该从一开始就制止他的计划，但我无法让自己这么做。一次又一次的机会摆在我面前，但我始终无法鼓起勇气去抓住它们。

Eventually the Third Impact would come just as SEELE and Gendo had wanted it to. The one saving grace is that it was not exactly as they desired it. Power was instead handed over to the boy that you left behind and wanted me to look out for. Your son saved the world and with it granted us another chance, for some of us it was an opportunity to atone for our sins. It is a chance that I have taken, I no longer want to change the world. I want to help people and put things right.  
最终，第三次冲击如 SEELE 和碇所愿降临了。唯一值得庆幸的是，它并未完全按照他们的意愿发生。力量转交给了那个你遗弃并希望我照顾的男孩。你的儿子拯救了世界，给了我们又一次机会，对某些人而言，这是赎罪的机会。我抓住了这个机会，不再想改变世界。我只想帮助人们，纠正错误。

I get up from my desk chair and stretch before heading over to the window. The stars are shining brightly tonight. I wonder that if I went to the observatory tonight I'd be able to see her. She is still out there and we have been keeping track of her as she drifts further and further away from our planet. Scans have indicated some faint energy signatures within her as she moves forward.  
我从办公椅上起身，伸了个懒腰，然后走向窗边。今晚星光灿烂。我在想，如果今晚去天文台，能否看到她。她仍在那里，我们一直在追踪她，随着她离我们的星球越来越远。扫描显示，随着她前行，内部出现了一些微弱的能量信号。

Within a few years she will pass through the Termination Shock and into the outer reaches of the Solar System. Yui will reach the same point that only a handful of man-made craft have reached in but a fraction of that time. She will reach interstellar space and then as she drifts further and further away into uncharted territory, she will become what she desired. Eternal proof that humankind existed.  
不出几年，她将穿越终止冲击，进入太阳系的外围区域。唯将以远超人类制造的少数飞行器所用时间的速度，抵达那些飞行器曾到达的节点。她将进入星际空间，随着她越飘越远，进入未知的领域，她将成为她所渴望的存在——人类存在的永恒证明。

I have to wonder, how lonely is that existence for you Yui? Are you aware of what is happening on Earth right now? Have you been receiving any of our communications? Are you conscious of what is around you or have you passed on?  
我不禁好奇，对你来说，那样的存在有多孤独呢，唯？你是否知晓地球上正在发生的事情？你是否接收到了我们的通讯？你是清醒地感知周围的一切，还是已经离去？

As for me, I'm trying to finally carry out my promise to you. I cannot watch out for Gendo but I can at least try to do the right thing for Shinji. After all my sins there is little I am able to do via direct contact but I have at least tried to make sure they're all protected. I've tried to make sure they have the opportunity for a future. It is my hope that maybe one day they might forgive me for my acts in the past.  
至于我，我正努力履行对你的承诺。我无法看顾源堂，但至少我可以尝试为真嗣做正确的事。尽管我罪孽深重，能直接做的有限，但我至少尽力确保他们的安全。我努力确保他们拥有未来的机会。我希望有一天，他们或许能原谅我过去的所作所为。

I leave my post by the window and move back to the computer. I see a new e-mail has appeared and it seems to be the one I've been waiting on for the last two weeks. I open it and feel the heart sink immediately. I do not know how I'm going to break this news to him. I said to him that everything would be fine, I promised him that he would be free to do as he wishes and yet they have done this.  
我离开窗边的岗位，回到电脑前。看到一封新邮件已经出现，似乎是我这两周来一直在等待的那封。我打开它，立刻感到心情沉重。我不知道该如何向他传达这个消息。我曾对他说过一切都会好起来的，我承诺过他会自由地做他想做的事，然而他们却做出了这样的决定。

I don't know whether to be angry with this or not. Perhaps I should have expected it to happen. They have been looking to make an example of someone for a while. They've been looking for someone to blame. Gendo will never return so they can't have him. SEELE have vanished as well. They want to be seen as punishing someone, if anything just to satiate their own desires but… did it have to be him?  
我不知道是否该对此感到愤怒。也许我本该预料到会发生这种事。他们一直想找个人来树立典型。他们一直在寻找替罪羊。源堂永远不会回来，所以他们无法对他下手。SEELE 也消失了。他们想要被视为在惩罚某人，哪怕只是为了满足自己的欲望……但，为什么非得是他呢？

_'Dear Kozou Fuytusuki, "'亲爱的风见柯佐之助，'_

_I write to you in relation to your recent request regarding the necessary permissions for one, Kaworu Nagisa, to travel to Japan in December of this year.  
我写信给您是关于您最近提出的关于卡沃鲁·渚先生今年十二月前往日本的必要许可请求。_

_Unfortunately given the former status of the Mr. Nagisa and after careful consideration by those involved we have seen fit to deny this request. The council simply feels that allowing a being like Mr. Nagisa to travel to Japan at this time would be too dangerous. It is our opinion that despite the initial reports of his humanity we do not have sufficient evidence that his former self has been completely removed.  
遗憾的是，鉴于渚先生之前的身份，经过相关人员的慎重考虑，我们决定拒绝这一请求。委员会认为，在当前时期允许像渚先生这样的存在前往日本过于危险。尽管最初有报告称他具有人性，但我们没有足够的证据证明他的过去已被完全消除。_

_In addition, we also have concerns regarding his motives for visiting Japan. Due to the ongoing situation regarding access to Tokyo-3 we find that it would be irresponsible to allow him any opportunity to travel to such a location. Whilst we have taken on board your reassurances that Mr. Nagisa is not affiliated with the group known as SEELE we do not have the sufficient evidence of this and whilst their location remains unknown we do not want to present an opportunity for him to make a move.  
此外，我们对他访问日本的动机也存在疑虑。鉴于目前对第三新东京市的准入情况，我们认为允许他前往该地是不负责任的。虽然我们听取了您关于渚先生与 SEELE 组织无关的保证，但我们缺乏足够的证据，而且由于他们的位置仍不明，我们不希望为他提供任何行动的机会。_

_We extend our apologies to Mr. Nagisa at this time but also want it to be made known that the decision of the council is final. If you would like to discuss more then please arrange an appointment via the usual channels.  
我们在此向长尾先生表示歉意，但同时也希望明确告知，委员会的决定是最终决定。如果您希望进一步讨论，请通过常规渠道安排预约。_

_Regards 此致_

_Jacques Laurent' 雅克·洛朗_

I close the e-mail and lower my head before leaning back in the seat. I have been around these sorts of people for many years and I have found that no matter who is present, one truth always remains, they will always be paranoid and looking to place blame at someone regardless of the person's guilt. They cannot find SEELE or Gendo and so they look at the next best person, the brainwashed victim.  
我关闭了电子邮件，低下头，然后靠回座椅。多年来，我一直在这种人中间周旋，我发现无论谁在场，一个事实始终不变：他们总是多疑，总想把责任推给某个人，不管这个人是否有罪。他们找不到 SEELE 或碇源堂，于是他们就盯上了下一个最佳人选，那个被洗脑的受害者。

Unfortunately I do not know how I can fight this, I don't know where I would start but I must try. My only concern is that pushing back against it will make them fall back to their original plans. I was only able to save Nagisa by the skin of my teeth. Originally they wanted him to face a full criminal trial, they wanted to lay everything at his feet.  
不幸的是，我不知道该如何应对这一点，我不知道该从何开始，但我必须尝试。我唯一担心的是，如果我反击，他们会退回到原来的计划。我仅以毫厘之差救下了渚薰。原本他们想让他接受全面的刑事审判，想把一切都归咎于他。

If I fight this then they will likely see it as an opportunity to go back to those original plans. Knowing them there would be some public angle to this as well. They would want to cover themselves in glory as being the ones to bring one of the major figures in SEELE to justice. The truth of what Nagisa is would go out there but few would believe it.  
如果我反抗，他们很可能会将其视为回归原计划的机会。了解他们，这其中还会有一些公众角度的考量。他们想要以将 SEELE 的主要人物之一绳之以法而自居荣耀。渚薰的真实情况会被公之于众，但很少有人会相信。

It is not just about Nagisa's innocence. He does not need the stress of such a thing in his life. He needs the opportunity to live his life without his past haunting him. He deserves to live freely as a human and take those opportunities that were denied to him. I must save Nagisa from that fate, he has already been through so much.  
这不仅仅关乎渚的纯真。他不需要在生活中承受这样的压力。他需要机会在没有过去阴影的情况下生活。他应该作为一个自由的人去抓住那些被剥夺的机会。我必须拯救渚，让他摆脱那样的命运，他已经经历了太多。

Unfortunately, I know those fools are both stubborn and uncaring in this situation. Even amidst the mountain of evidence they had they refused to believe the truth of his humanity. Nagisa would face invasive medical examination after invasive medical examination, he would submit blood test after blood test and still continues to do so just to prove he is what he said he is. Yet it is still not good enough for them.  
不幸的是，我知道那些家伙在这件事上既固执又无情。即便面对堆积如山的证据，他们仍然拒绝相信他的人性真相。渚将一次又一次地接受侵入性的医学检查，一次又一次地提交血液检测，即便如此，他仍在继续，只为证明他所说的身份。然而，这对他们来说仍然不够。

I know this news will break his heart. I dread the idea of telling him but I will have to do so, but I hope he knows that I will fight this.  
我知道这个消息会让他心碎。我害怕告诉他这个想法，但我必须这么做，不过我希望他知道我会为此斗争。

**1st October 2021 – Kaworu Nagisa  
2021 年 10 月 1 日 – 渚薰**

_'Confusion will be my epitaph  
“困惑将成我的墓志铭”_  
_As I crawl a cracked and broken path  
当我蹒跚于一条破碎的小径_  
_If we make it we can all sit back

但我担心明天我会哭泣_

The final parts of the song come through my headphones as I sit and try to focus on finishing typing up these documents I'm working on. It is proving to be a difficult, typing up minutes from meetings and draft letters is not the most taxing of tasks, therefore it is easy for my thoughts to drift. Normally I would not mind my thoughts drifting, daydreaming can be pleasant but today they are just filled with thoughts of the situation with Shinji.  
歌曲的最后部分通过我的耳机传来，我坐在那里试图集中精力完成正在处理的这些文件。这项工作确实很困难，整理会议记录和草拟信件并不是最繁重的任务，因此我的思绪很容易飘散。通常我不会介意思绪飘散，白日梦也可以很愉快，但今天我的脑海里全是关于真嗣的情况。

Asuka has assured me that things will work themselves out. It is not that I don't believe her, I do believe when she says such things, I also believe that she would not say such things to me were she to have any doubts. Yet, I still feel so very uneasy about the situation. I keep on replaying the conversation from yesterday and wondering what I could have said or done differently to avoid such a thing.  
明日香向我保证事情会自行解决。我并非不相信她，我确实相信她这么说的时候，我也相信如果她有任何疑虑，她不会对我说这样的话。然而，我仍然对这种情况感到非常不安。我不断回放昨天的对话，想知道我本可以说些什么或做些什么来避免这种情况。

I know all too well the folly in this way of thinking though. All I will end up doing it putting myself into an endless cycle of questioning and doubt. The truth is that I am unable to go back and change any of what was said or done. I have to live with it and move forward. I just wish that things are resolved sooner, rather than later.  
我深知这种思考方式的愚蠢。我最终只会陷入无尽的质疑和怀疑之中。事实是我无法回到过去改变任何已经说过或做过的事情。我必须接受它并继续前进。我只希望事情能尽快解决，而不是拖延。

I dislike this uncertainty of how long it could take and where things stand. I dislike that I am having to rely on others to resolve my mistakes. I know the latter is not exactly true, I am not relying on people to resolve it, we are all here to help one another, it is just my impatience speaking. Still, I feel like I could do more, I have been tempted to try and call him myself but I don't know what good such a thing would do. Knowing me, I would just mess it all up again and make it worse. I just need to be patient.  
我不喜欢这种不确定感，不知道事情会拖多久，也不知道现状如何。我不喜欢自己不得不依赖他人来解决我的错误。我知道后者并不完全正确，我不是依赖别人来解决，我们都在这里互相帮助，只是我的不耐烦在说话。尽管如此，我觉得我能做得更多，我曾想亲自给他打电话，但不知道这样做有什么好处。以我的性格，我只会再次搞砸一切，让情况变得更糟。我只需要耐心等待。

I lean back in my chair and look around the empty office. It is strange to see Fuyutsuki absent today, he called me earlier this morning to inform me that he has had to take the day off in order to resolve an important and unexpected situation. I've been told to simply type up these documents and then given the rest of the day off.  
我靠在椅背上，环顾空荡荡的办公室。今天看到冬月不在，感觉很奇怪，他今早打电话告诉我，他不得不请一天假去处理一个重要且突发的状况。我被告知只需把这些文件打出来，然后就可以休息一天了。

I could return home but I know Asuka is busy today working on things for her book, so perhaps I should explore the city. It has been quite some time since I have properly had the opportunity to take a walk, or at least it has been a long time since I've taken the opportunity. Ever since the attack I've not dared venture out as much as I used to, a few times but only short trips and any longer trips have been with Asuka. Yes, I think I will walk along the riverside to clear my mind.  
我可以回家，但我知道明日香今天忙着为她的书做事情，所以也许我应该探索一下这座城市。我已经很久没有好好地散步了，或者说，自从那次袭击后，我就不敢像以前那样经常出门了，只有几次短途旅行，而且任何长途旅行都是和明日香一起。是的，我想我会沿着河边散步，清理一下思绪。

I lean forward again and begin to start on the next document, my final one and my phone starts to ring before I can even begin typing. I let out a slight sigh of annoyance, I was hoping to just get through this without any interruptions. Still, it might be Asuka, I glance at the phone and see an unrecognized number. I contemplate ignoring it and getting on with my work but instead I pause my music and answer the phone.  
我再次前倾，开始处理下一个文件，这是我最后一个文件，我的手机在我开始打字之前就开始响了。我发出了一声轻微的叹息，感到有些恼火，我本希望能不受打扰地完成这些工作。不过，可能是明日香，我瞥了一眼手机，看到一个不认识的号码。我考虑过忽略它继续工作，但最终我暂停了音乐，接起了电话。

"Hello?" “喂？”

_"Hello, Is this Nagisa?" “你好，是渚吗？”_

I frown as the persons voice comes through the speaker. It is a young woman's voice and one that is strangely familiar. It is soft and yet has a directness to it that I am sure I have heard before. I find it curious that she has addressed me by my surname as well.  
我皱起眉头，当那个人的声音通过扬声器传来。那是一个年轻女子的声音，出奇地熟悉。她的声音柔和，却又带着一种我确信曾听过的直接。她用我的姓氏称呼我，这让我感到好奇。

"Yes, it is, who is this?" I answer her and inquire as to who it might be.  
“是的，是谁？”我回答她，并询问她是谁。

_"This is Rei Ayanami. Shinji's sister, I am not disturbing you, am I?"  
“我是绫波零，真嗣的妹妹，我没有打扰到你吧？”_

Almost immediately on hearing her speak her name I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up on edge. I feel that cold sweat start to break out and my stomach churns. I contemplate telling her that I am busy at the moment and unable to speak to her. I am at work after all but then if I did that then I'd only be delaying an inevitable conversation with her.  
几乎在她开口说出自己名字的那一刻，我就感到后颈的毛发竖立起来。我感到冷汗开始冒出，胃部翻腾。我考虑告诉她我现在很忙，无法和她交谈。毕竟我正在工作，但如果我这么做，只会推迟与她不可避免的对话。

I shake my head, "No... I am... not busy."  
我摇了摇头，"不...我并不...忙。"

_"Good." “好。”_

My mouth is so dry, I pick up my coffee cup and sip the some of it. It's turned cold, horribly cold and I immediately put the cup back down with a trembling hand. The last time I saw Rei Ayanami was the day of my death. I remember looking up at her from within the grasp of Unit 01s hand. I remember the glare she gave me, it told me everything I needed to know. I cannot imagine now, that over the course of the last five years her hatred of me will have changed. In fact, I am aware of her dislike of me, it is something Asuka has alluded to.  
我的嘴巴干涩无比，拿起咖啡杯抿了一口。咖啡已经变冷，冷得可怕，我立刻用颤抖的手将杯子放回原处。上次见到绫波零的那天，正是我死亡的日子。我记得从零一机甲的手掌中抬头看向她。我记得她给我的那个眼神，它告诉我了一切我需要知道的事情。我无法想象，在过去五年的时间里，她对我的恨意会有所改变。事实上，我知道她不喜欢我，这是明日香曾经暗示过的。

I can't really blame Rei for having such an attitude towards me. After all I deserve her hatred, after what I did to her brother and her world how could she not? Now I have managed to hurt her brother again, I dread to think of what she has to say to me.  
我不能真的怪丽对我有这样的态度。毕竟我应得她的憎恨，我对我做了她哥哥和她世界的事，她怎么能不恨我呢？现在我又一次伤害了她的哥哥，我害怕去想她会怎么对我说。

_"I presume you already know why I am contacting you?"  
“我想你已经知道我为什么联系你了吧？”_

If I was slightly unsure of the reason before then that did indeed confirm it. I try to answer, my voice slightly weak with my nerves and fear, "It... It is regarding my conversation with Shinji yesterday, isn't it?"  
如果之前我还不太确定原因的话，那么这确实证实了。我试图回答，声音因紧张和恐惧而略显虚弱，“是……是因为我昨天和真嗣的谈话，对吧？”

"Yes, it is." She responds bluntly, "Shinji was quite upset with the events."  
"是的，确实如此。" 她直截了当地回答，"真嗣对这些事情感到非常沮丧。"

In a way I appreciate her honestly, it is good to know for certain how Shinji felt about what happened. At the same time all I can feel is sadness at knowing that I did manage to upset him.  
某种程度上，我很感激她的坦诚，能确切了解真嗣对发生事情的感受是件好事。但与此同时，得知我确实让他感到难过，我只能感到悲伤。

"I… I am sorry about that, it was not my intention to hurt him."  
"我……对此感到抱歉，我无意伤害他。"

_"You do not need to apologize for what happened."_ Rei quickly replies, _"It is my understanding that you too were also upset and it is my belief that neither of you were to blame."_  
"你不需要为发生的事情道歉。" 丽迅速回答，"据我所知，你当时也很沮丧，我认为你们双方都没有错。"

"No…" I begin to protest, "It… It was my fault, I was to blame! When he contacted me, I should not have said what I did, I should have asked him to speak to me later."  
"不……" 我开始辩解，"那是……那是我的错，我应该负责！当他联系我时，我不该说那些话，我应该让他稍后再跟我谈。"

_"But you did say what you did."_ She replies, _"And I feel you were not wrong in what you but I feel that in this instance it did not work out as neither of you had hoped. When Shinji contacted you I do not believe he wanted things to work out in this fashion either. I… I am no stranger to things not working out as planned myself."_  
"但你确实说了那些话。" 她回答，"我觉得你说的并没有错，但在这件事上，结果并没有如你们所愿。当真嗣联系你时，我相信他也不希望事情变成这样。我……我自己也深知计划往往不如意。"

I say nothing in reply but I do feel a half smile come to my lips. I am certain that she is of course referring to what happened between herself and Shinji only a few weeks ago. I remember Asuka telling me that Rei was really upset about what had happened. There is a brief moment of silence between us, and I sense that Rei is taking the time to collect her thoughts.  
我并未作答，只是唇边浮现了一抹淡淡的笑意。我确信她当然是指几周前她和真嗣之间发生的那件事。我记得明日香告诉我，绫波当时真的很伤心。我们之间有短暂的沉默，我能感觉到绫波正在整理思绪。

Finally she speaks once more, _"I have to ask you, are you truly sincere in wanting to mend your friendship with my brother?"_  
最终她再次开口，“我必须问你，你真心想要修复与我的弟弟的友谊吗？”

"Yes… Very serious." I answer her, "I would like nothing more than to… speak with him and put things right. I know that… after what I did to him it is a lot to ask. I probably don't deserve his forgiveness or friendship but I would like a chance to explain things to him at the very least."  
“是的……非常认真。”我回答她，“我别无所求，只希望能……与他谈谈，把事情理顺。我知道……在我对他做了那些事之后，这要求很高。我可能不配得到他的原谅或友谊，但我至少希望能有机会向他解释清楚。”

_"That is good."_ She responds, _"I am pleased that this is the case. I… I will help you then, if you are truly sincere then I would like to help you. First though, I feel I must apologize to you. When I first heard of your return and of your friendship with Asuka I had… something of an unkind attitude towards you. I know you are not aware of what I have said but they were unpleasant. I… I feel it would be best to clear this up with you. I… I disliked you, not just because of what you did but because I saw in you the things that I have tried to forget I was."_  
“那很好。”她回应道，“我很高兴情况如此。我……如果你真心诚意，那么我愿意帮助你。不过首先，我觉得必须向你道歉。当我最初听说你回来，以及你和明日香之间的友谊时，我……对你抱有一些不友好的态度。我知道你并不了解我说过的话，但它们确实令人不快。我……我觉得最好与你澄清这一点。我……我曾不喜欢你，不仅仅是因为你所做的事，而是我在你身上看到了那些我试图忘记的自己。”

She takes another moment to pause, I saw nothing, merely listening to her in a stunned silence, _"You and I, we are the same Nagisa. I remember you saying such a thing to me once and you were correct. We were both created for a similar purpose. We were both created from beings of immense power. The difference is that we ended up on opposite sides of the fight. We were set up to be enemies and by all rights we should not be here today. We are both lucky to be alive and lucky that we have the chance to seek forgiveness in others. I do not wish to be your enemy any longer, I do not want to dislike you anymore. Kaworu Nagisa… I would like to be your friend."_  
她又停顿了一会儿，我什么也没看到，只是震惊地沉默着听她说话，“渚薰，你和我，我们是一样的。你曾对我说过这样的话，而你是对的。我们都是为了相似的目的被创造出来的。我们都是由拥有巨大力量的存在所创造。不同的是，我们最终站在了战斗的对立面。我们被设定为敌人，按理说我们今天不应该还活着。我们都很幸运能活下来，幸运地有机会寻求他人的宽恕。我不想再成为你的敌人，我不想再不喜欢你了。渚薰……我想成为你的朋友。”

Rei's words take me completely by surprise and I open my mouth to reply but no words come out. Instead I feel that lump at the back of my throat forming, I struggle to blink away the tears and compose myself, "T-Thank you…"  
绫波的话完全出乎我的意料，我张开嘴想要回答，却说不出话来。相反，我感觉到喉咙后部形成了一个硬块，我努力眨眼忍住泪水，整理自己的情绪，“谢……谢谢你……”

I trail off needing a bit more time to get myself together, "T-Thank you Rei, I… I would like to be your friend too. I… I know my actions in the past were hurtful but… I am trying to make up for them."  
我需要更多时间来整理自己，“谢谢你，绫波，我……我也想成为你的朋友。我……我知道我过去的所作所为很伤人，但……我正在努力弥补。”

_"I know, it is something we are all trying to do."_ Rei answers, _"I wish to know about your past, perhaps it can help to fix this situation. Tell me… who are you Kaworu Nagisa?"_  
"我知道，这是我们都在努力做的事情。" 丽回答道，"我想了解你的过去，也许这能帮助解决当前的局面。告诉我……你是谁，渚薰？"

I shake my head as I start to tell Rei about who I am, "There… There isn't a lot to tell you. My life was… mostly uneventful. I was… brought to life on the thirteenth of September 2000, the day of Second Impact. Thought I did not gain full consciousness until a few years later, at the age of four."  
我摇了摇头，开始向丽讲述我的身世，"那里……没什么太多可说的。我的生活……大部分都很平淡。我是在 2000 年 9 月 13 日，第二次冲击那天被创造出来的。虽然直到几年后，四岁时我才完全有了意识。"

_"I see, so it has recently been your Birthday?"_ Rei asks me curiously, _"That is strange, Asuka did not mention anything."_  
"我明白了，那你最近刚过完生日吗？" 丽好奇地问我，"这很奇怪，明日香什么都没提过。"

I shake my head again, "N-No, she wouldn't have done. I… I didn't feel it was a day worth celebrating or mentioning."  
我再次摇头，“不，她不会那样做的。我……我觉得那不是值得庆祝或提及的日子。”

"I understand." Rei says, "So tell me what happened after you gained consciousness. Were you always aware of what you were?"  
“我明白了。”丽说，“那么告诉我，你醒来后发生了什么？你一直都知道自己是什么吗？”

"No, not at first." I reply, "That would come much later. For the first six months of my life I was raised by a nanny. She was a kind woman, a brown haired lady with red rimmed glasses. She taught me how to read and how to write. She always told me how clever I was, apparently I picked up things quicker than any other child she had looked after. It was… nice, but then after six months she went 'away'"  
“不，一开始并不知道。”我回答，“那是很久以后的事了。我生命的前六个月是由一位保姆抚养的。她是个善良的女人，一位棕色头发、戴着红色边框眼镜的女士。她教会了我阅读和写作。她总是夸我聪明，显然我学东西比她照顾过的其他孩子都快。那段时光……很美好，但六个月后她就‘离开’了。”

My voice darkens as I say the last part and there is silence again as Rei seems to mull over what I've said. I'm fairly sure she could tell from my tone what I was implying by that last part. After a few more seconds Rei replies, her voice is softer this time, "I… I am sorry to hear that, do you know that that is what happened?"  
我的声音在说到最后一部分时变得低沉，四周再次陷入沉默，仿佛丽正在思索我所说的话。我相当确定，从我的语气中她能听出我最后那句话的隐含之意。几秒钟后，丽再次开口，这次她的声音柔和了许多，“我……听到这些我很难过，你知道发生了什么吗？”

"Do I know that she was killed?" I answer, "No, I don't, I never found out the truth but I can put the pieces together. SEELE probably felt she had been around for too long and she had been exposed to me for too long so they had her killed… She… She was a good person…"  
“我是否知道她被杀？”我回答，“不，我不知道，我从未查明真相，但我能拼凑出大概。SEELE 可能觉得她存在太久了，而且她与我接触太久，所以他们把她除掉了……她……她是个好人……”

I pause again to gather my thoughts, of all the things I expected to talk about today my life growing up was not one of them. Nor did I expect to be sharing these stories with Rei Ayanami of all people.  
我再次停顿，整理思绪，今天我本以为会谈论的事情中，绝没有关于我成长经历的这一项。更没想到会与绫波丽——所有这些人中——分享这些故事。

"After… After she vanished I was visited by Kiel for the first time. He didn't tell me much, only that I was 'special'" I spit out the words bitterly.  
"在她……消失后，我第一次见到了基尔。他没告诉我太多，只说我‘特别’。" 我苦涩地吐出这些字眼。

"From there a cycle would start. I would have more nannies and other teachers. They would appear for six months at a time and then they would vanish. Kiel would visit me at points over those years. He would tell me all about the ills of society and about the damage mankind has done to itself and the planet. He would drip feed me more about my role, speak of my grand destiny to help cleanse humanity of all its sins." My voice starts to shake as I speak, it is a mixture of anger and sorrow, "I bought all of his lies."  
从那时起，一个循环开始了。我会迎来新的保姆和其他老师。他们每六个月出现一次，然后就会消失。这些年里，基尔会在某些时刻来看我。他会告诉我社会的种种弊病，以及人类对自己和地球造成的伤害。他会一点一点地向我透露我的角色，谈论我帮助净化人类所有罪孽的伟大命运。" 我说话时声音开始颤抖，那是愤怒与悲伤的混合，"我全盘接受了他的谎言。

_"I… understand, I was no different in believing what I was told of my destiny by Commander Ikari. We knew nothing else Kaworu."  
我……理解，在相信碇司令告诉我的命运这件事上，我和你并无不同。我们别无选择，薰。_

I nod my head, "No… We didn't. Aside from that my upbringing was unremarkable. It was a structured upbringing, all done as Kiel and SEELE designed it. I had minimal exposure to the outside world. Every book I read, every news article I saw, every bit of pop culture I absorbed was filtered by SEELE first. Even the music I learned to play on the piano was hand-picked by Kiel."  
我点点头，“不……我们没有。除了这些，我的成长经历平淡无奇。一切都是按照基尔和 SEELE 的设计有条不紊地进行。我对外界的接触极为有限。我所读的每一本书，看到的每一条新闻，吸收的每一点流行文化，都先经过 SEELE 的筛选。甚至连我在钢琴上学习的曲目，也是基尔亲自挑选的。”

_"I see…"_ Rei spaks, _"So when did you learn fully of what you were and of your mission to go to Tokyo-3?"_  
“我明白了……”绫波说，“那么，你是什么时候完全了解自己的身份和前往第三新东京市的任务的？”

My mouth dries up once more as I try to figure out the right words to say. I do not have any difficulty in remembering it though, that time period is very clear in my head.  
当我试图找到合适的词句时，我的嘴巴再次变得干燥。不过，回忆起那段时间并不困难，那段记忆在我脑海中异常清晰。

"The older I got the more Kiel would speak to me of my destiny and tell me of my important task. I… admit I didn't fully understand how I could be so special, I didn't feel special in anyway until one day… I felt a sudden change within myself, it was the day that the Third Angel attacked."  
"随着年龄的增长，基尔愈发频繁地向我提及我的命运，告诉我那重要的任务。我……承认我并未完全理解自己何以如此特别，我并未感到自己有何特别之处，直到有一天……我内心突然发生了变化，那是在第三次使徒袭击的那一天。"

_"The call of Lillith…"_ Rei muses.  
"莉莉丝的召唤……" 绫波沉思道。

"Yes! You felt it too right?" I almost stand up as I ask her eagerly, Rei knew of the call of Lillith. Does this mean that she too understand the pain that I felt from it? Did she feel the call too? I know the others did, my so called brethren. Those grotesque monsters that threatened this very planet. I almost ended up like them, I could have taken on the form of some gargantuan nightmare instead of this human body I ended up inhabiting. I suppose that is the one thing I should be thankful to SEELE for, they rescued Tabris and guided it into this body.  
"是的！你也感受到了对吧？" 我几乎激动得要站起来问她，绫波知晓莉莉丝的召唤。这是否意味着她也理解我因之而感到的痛苦？她是否也感受到了那召唤？我知道其他人也感受到了，那些所谓的同胞。那些威胁着这颗星球的丑陋怪物。我差点就变成了他们那样，我本可能化身为某种巨大的噩梦，而不是现在这个人类的躯体。我想这是我唯一应该感谢 SEELE 的地方，他们救下了塔布里斯，并引导它进入了这个身体。"

_"Yes."_ Rei finally answers me, _"I too felt the call."_  
“是的。”丽终于回答了我，“我也感受到了那呼唤。”

"SEELE… Well Kiel, he explained to me that the pain I was feeling was from Adam. Adam was the father and that my role, as the son, would be to reunite with Adam and bring forth a new dawn for humanity." I continue to explain to her, as I speak I can again hear the anger and bitterness in my voice, "One by one the other Angels fell… I could feel their screams of pain as they perished. It was… not pleasant but I knew that they had to die. There was only one being worthy of accomplishing the task of uniting with Adam and that was me. After… After five months I was told my day had come, I was to go to Tokyo-3."  
“SEELE……好吧，基尔他向我解释，我感受到的痛苦来自亚当。亚当是父亲，而我作为儿子的角色，就是要与亚当重聚，为人类带来新的黎明。”我继续向她解释，随着话语的展开，我再次听到了自己声音中的愤怒与苦涩，“一个接一个，其他使徒倒下了……我能感受到他们临死前的痛苦尖叫。那感觉……并不愉快，但我知道他们必须死。只有一个人有资格完成与亚当的合一，那就是我。五个月后，我被告知那一天已经到来，我必须前往第三新东京市。”

I can feel my heart tightening as I speak those words, I'm starting to feel sick as I recall how I felt on the day I was told I would be going. Unlike now, back then I felt no fear, instead I was excited to be given my tasks and told that my actions would save humanity and lead it to a new future.  
说出这些话时，我能感觉到心脏在收紧，回忆起被告知即将前往的那一天，我开始感到恶心。与现在不同，那时我并不感到恐惧，反而对被赋予任务并被告知我的行动将拯救人类、引领其走向新未来而感到兴奋。

_"You would become the Fifth Child, so at that point you knew of your nature as an Angel? Had you piloted an Evangelion at that point?"  
"你将成为第五适格者，所以那时你就知道了自己作为使徒的本质？在那之前你已经驾驶过 EVA 了吗？"_

"No, I hadn't. The Eva Series was in production and SEELE was more than confident in my abilities to not rush anything. Over the course of those five months I had become adept in manifesting and using my A.T. Field. They informed me what the A.T. Field was and of the nature of the Evangelions. When the day approached they told me that the soul within Unit 02 had regressed meaning the creature within it would easily submit to my will."  
"没有，我还没有。EVA 系列正在生产中，SEELE 对我的能力非常有信心，不急于一时。在那五个月里，我熟练掌握了显现和使用 A.T.力场的能力。他们告诉我 A.T.力场是什么，以及 EVA 的本质。当那一天临近时，他们告诉我，02 号机内的灵魂已经退化，这意味着其中的生物会轻易屈服于我的意志。"

I pause again, "They told me a brief version of what the Angels were and where humanity come from. I knew humanity from that moment forward as the Lilin. I was then given my complete mission, first I was to befriend Shinji Ikari. They told me about him and his history, gave me enough to be able to approach him and speak to him, tell him what he would want to hear. I…. I would befriend him and then I would go and unite with Adam… I… I was…"  
我再次停顿，“他们简要地告诉我使徒是什么，以及人类从何而来。从那一刻起，我知道人类被称为李林。然后，我被赋予了完整的任务，首先我要与碇真嗣成为朋友。他们向我介绍了他的背景和历史，给了我足够的信息去接近他，与他交谈，告诉他他想听的话。我……我会与他成为朋友，然后我会去与亚当合一……我……我是……”

I have to pause again as the lump in my throat returns. I still have more to tell Rei, about me betraying him, about me finding out I was the one who had been betrayed. All those years believing I was special and had a purpose only to find out my purpose was to die. I feel the tears start to flow and I let out a choked sob, "I… I… I'm so sorry Rei, I'm sorry… I'm sorry… I didn't… I didn't want to hurt him… I… I…."  
我不得不再次停顿，因为喉咙里的硬块又回来了。我还有更多要告诉丽，关于我背叛了他，关于我发现自己是被背叛的那个人。多年来一直相信自己是特别的，有目的的，结果却发现我的目的是去死。泪水开始涌出，我发出哽咽的呜咽声，“我……我……丽，对不起，对不起……对不起……我不是……我不是想伤害他……我……我……”

_"Nagisa…"_ I hear Rei speak my name and it pulls me from my hysteria, _"I… I am sorry you had to do what you did."_  
“渚……”我听到丽叫我的名字，这让我从歇斯底里中抽离出来，“我……我为你不得不做那些事感到抱歉。”

I sniff loudly as I wipe away a tear, "I… Thought I was going to help people Rei. It wasn't until I saw Lillith standing in front of me that I knew… that what I was doing was wrong and then… I had no choice but to die."  
我用力吸了吸鼻子，擦去眼泪，“我……以为我会帮助别人，丽。直到我看到莉莉丝站在我面前，我才知道……我所做的是错的，然后……我别无选择，只能去死。”

I wipe away another tear, "I know that doesn't justify any of it. I know I don't deserve forgiveness but…"  
我擦去另一滴泪，“我知道这并不能为任何事开脱。我知道我不配得到宽恕，但是……”

_"No, you are wrong."_ Rei interrupts me, _"You do deserve forgiveness. You deserve the same opportunities that I have been granted. You and I… we are the same. I was created for a singular purpose and I was on the verge of carrying it out. It was only at the last minute that I was stopped and even then… my actions caused a lot of pain and suffering."_  
“不，你错了。”丽打断了我，“你确实值得宽恕。你应该得到和我一样的机会。你和我……我们是一样的。我被创造出来只有一个目的，并且我差点就要完成它。只是在最后一刻我被阻止了，即便如此……我的行为造成了许多痛苦和苦难。”

I listen as she speaks, _"When I returned I feared that people would know and hate me for what I had done. They did not, instead they accepted me, Shinji… Asuka… Misato they forgave me without question. They never spoke of what I had done and so I buried it. My story is not dissimilar to yours Kaworu, we were both raised in ignorance of the truth and used as tools to be cast aside by others. You… You do deserve forgiveness and I will help you."_  
我听着她说话，“当我回来时，我害怕人们会知道并憎恨我做过的事。他们没有，反而接纳了我，真嗣……明日香……美里，他们无条件地原谅了我。他们从未提及我所做的事，于是我将其埋藏。我的故事与你并无太大不同，薰，我们都曾在无知中被抚养长大，被当作工具被他人抛弃。你……你确实值得宽恕，我会帮助你。”

I smile, "Thank you… Truly Rei… Thank you so much."  
我微笑着，“谢谢你……真的，丽……非常感谢。”

**1st October 2021 – Asuka Langley Soryu  
2021 年 10 月 1 日 – 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I finish taping up the final box, when I'm certain it's properly sealed I pick up up and stack it with the numerous other boxes filled with copies of my book. As I set it down I look at my wrist hoping that the cramp will go away soon. This activity isn't something I feel like doing again any time soon. Unfortunately, in a few weeks it is something I will be doing as I've already agreed to sign double the amount of copies of the second book.  
我完成了最后一个箱子的封箱工作，确认它密封无误后，我将其抬起并与其他装满我书籍副本的众多箱子堆放在一起。放下箱子时，我看着手腕，希望那阵抽筋能尽快消失。这种活动我短期内实在不想再做一次。不幸的是，几周后我将不得不再次进行这项工作，因为我已经同意为第二本书签售两倍的副本数量。

I'm still not entirely sure of my decision to do this. I wanted to remain completely anonymous, to not take part in any activities like book signings or media appearances. The only reason I agreed to it this time was due to it being for a good cause.  
我仍然不完全确定我做出这个决定是否正确。我本想保持完全匿名，不参与任何如签售会或媒体露面之类的活动。这次我之所以同意，唯一的原因是它是为了一个好的事业。

I must admit though, I am quite excited for the release of the second book. Rei was even able to persuade me to have a little celebration to mark the release of it when I go to Japan. Of course, the release date also coincides with my birthday. I've requested it to be a small affair, nothing big, just me and the few people who know it is me writing them. I don't want any balloons or fuss made. A cake would be nice but no more than that.  
不过，我必须承认，我对第二本书的发行感到相当兴奋。丽甚至说服了我，在我去日本时为它的发行举行一个小小的庆祝活动。当然，发行日期也恰逢我的生日。我要求它是一个小型的聚会，不要太大，只有少数几个知道是我写这些书的人参加。我不想要气球或大肆庆祝。一个蛋糕会很好，但仅此而已。

It does limit the number of people who would be there but I'd rather it be that way. It's more people than I deserve to celebrate anything to do with me. There is a problem that needs sorting out first though. The issue between Shinji and Kaworu and there won't be any celebration unless we can sort that out.  
这确实限制了在场的人数，但我宁愿这样。庆祝任何与我有关的事情，我都不配得到这么多人的关注。不过，首先有一个问题需要解决。真嗣和薰之间的问题，如果我们不能解决这个问题，就不会有任何庆祝活动。

I shouldn't worry about that, we will sort out that problem. Despite my fears about what will happen I do want to make sure they can be friends again. I need to ignore those fears I have about the two of them, I know the feelings are there but I also have feelings for Shinji as well but I'm not going to betray or leave Kaworu over them. I don't think he'd do anything either and I damn sure know Shinji won't try anything.  
我不该为此担心，我们会解决那个问题的。尽管我对即将发生的事情感到恐惧，但我确实希望确保他们能再次成为朋友。我需要忽视对他们的那些担忧，我知道那种感觉存在，但我对真嗣也有感情，不过我不会因此背叛或离开薰。我认为他也不会做出什么，我绝对相信真嗣也不会有什么企图。

I know my dreams have indicated otherwise but they are just dreams and to be honest I've never really been one for having good dreams. Most of my childhood was filled with nightmares and the years that followed haven't brought much warmth in dreams either. Yet, dreams are just dreams, they aren't reality and I should focus on that.  
我知道我的梦预示了相反的情况，但那只是梦，老实说我从未真正有过好梦。我的童年充满了噩梦，随后的岁月里梦境也并未带来多少温暖。然而，梦终究只是梦，并非现实，我应该专注于这一点。

I move back towards the table where a sole copy of my book sits. I open it to the first page and grab the pen I've been using to sign the others. This is a special copy of the book, not one to go to charity but instead one I'll be sending to Shinji. I put the dedication at the top and then sign it underneath, for this one I don't use the signature I made up for Mari Makinami, I use my own real signature.  
我回到桌前，那里放着唯一一本我的书。我翻到第一页，拿起用来签名的笔。这是一本特别的书，不是捐给慈善机构的，而是我要寄给真嗣的。我在顶部写上赠言，然后在下面签名，这次我没有用为真希波·真理·伊兰崔亚斯编造的签名，而是用了我自己的真实签名。

_'To Shinji, '致真嗣，_

_Sorry it took so long.'  
抱歉让你久等了。'_

I slide the book into a padded envelope with his address written out on the top. I'll have to go and post that later, after the courier comes to pick up all of these boxes. That gives me a few hours to spend doing something productive. I look towards the open door into Kaworu's spare room and see more stacked boxes, these ones containing things I've brought over from my apartment. I could be productive and sort some of them out.  
我将书滑入一个带衬垫的信封，上面写着他的地址。稍后我得去邮局寄出，快递员来取走这些箱子之后。这样我就有几个小时的时间做些有意义的事。我望向卡沃鲁的备用房间敞开的门，看到更多堆叠的箱子，这些是从我公寓搬来的物品。我可以利用这段时间整理一些。

Or I could play video games all day. It's a tough decision.  
或者我可以整天玩电子游戏。这真是个艰难的决定。

I walk to and pick up the controller but as I do so I hear the buzzer to the door go. I look across in confusion, the courier wasn't due to arrive until later this afternoon and Kaworu is still at work. Neither of us are expecting any packages and it's not like Kaworu gets any visitors. I pick up the receiver, "Hello?"  
我走过去拿起控制器，但就在这时，门铃响了。我困惑地看向门口，快递应该下午晚些时候才到，而渚还在上班。我们俩都没在等什么包裹，而且渚也不太可能有访客。我拿起听筒，"喂？"

"Miss Soryu? Is Nagisa with you at the moment?"  
""碇小姐？渚现在和你在一起吗？""

I stifle a groan as I look at the receiver in annoyance, the voice belongs to that of Kozou Fuyutsuki. Why he is here I don't know. Also, I'm not sure why he is asking if Kaworu is here with me either. Surely, he'd know Kaworu is at work, unless... No, that can't be it, nothing could have happened to kaworu, otherwise he would know about it.  
我压抑着不满的呻吟，看着手中的电话，那头传来的是冬月耕造的声音。他为何在此，我不得而知。同样，我也不明白他为何询问碇真嗣是否与我在一起。他肯定知道碇真嗣在工作，除非……不，不可能，碇真嗣不会有事的，否则他应该已经知道了。

"No, he isn't here with me." I reply, trying to keep calm, "Did he not show up to work?"  
“不，他没和我在一起。”我尽量保持平静地回答，“他没去上班吗？”

_"He did, but I told him he could take the rest of the day off when he finished his work. I was hoping I could get here before he came home. May I come inside, it's quite important."  
“他去了，但我让他完成工作后可以休息一天。我希望能在他回家前赶到这里。我能进来吗，这事相当重要。”_

I breathe a sigh of relief, nothing has happened to Kaworu, that is good but now I have more questions. Why was he given the rest of the day off and why is Fuyutsuki here now? I generally have little, if any, desire to speak to Fuyutsuki. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful to him for helping me when I left Japan and in sorting out compensation for me and the others.  
我松了一口气，还好没什么事发生在渚薰身上，这算是好消息，但现在我有了更多疑问。为什么他被准许休息一整天，还有为什么现在在这里的是冬月？我通常很少，如果有的话，想和冬月交谈。别误会，我对他帮我离开日本以及为我与其他人处理补偿事宜心存感激。

At the same time, I figure it's the least he could do for all we were put through as a result of the actions of him and the others. I would be very easy for me to just dismiss him but I should hear him out. If he says it is important then I can't ignore that.  
同时，我认为这是他至少能为我们所经历的一切做出的补偿，这一切都是因为他和其他人的行为。我很容易就能直接打发他走，但我应该听他说完。如果他说事情重要，那我就不能忽视。

"Fine, come on through." I finally say.  
“好吧，进来吧。”我终于说道。

I reattach the phone and buzz Fuyutsuki through into the apartment. A few moments later he is at the door and I let him through. He stops a few steps into the room and looks down curiously at the number of boxes stacked nearby.  
我重新接好电话，让冬月通过门禁进入公寓。片刻后，他站在门口，我让他进来。他走进房间几步，好奇地低头看着附近堆放的许多箱子。

"Signed books." I begin to explain, "I was 'persuaded' to sign a few hundred copies for charity."  
“签名书。”我开始解释，“我被‘说服’为慈善活动签了几百本。”

"I see." Fuyutsuko nods his head, "That is most gracious of you, I am sure that it will be appreciated. I must admit, I am surprised, I thought you didn't want any part of something like that."  
“原来如此。”冬月点点头，“你真是慷慨，我相信这会受到感激的。我得承认，我很惊讶，我以为你不想参与这类事情。”

I shrug, "I don't and I'm still signing the books as Mari Makinami not as myself. I just figure I should do something to help out."  
我耸耸肩，“我不这么认为，我仍然以真希波·真理·真名的身份签名，而不是我自己。我只是觉得我应该做点什么来帮忙。”

"Understandable, well regardless it is a good gesture." He moves further into the room as he speaks, "I am also pleased to hear that you are back in contact with Ikari."  
“可以理解，无论如何，这都是一个善意的举动。”他说着，向房间深处走去，“我也很高兴听说你和碇重新联系上了。”

"I presume Kaworu told you?" I ask him, I'm not completely surprised that he knows. If it wasn't Kaworu that told him then I presume one of his people tracking us told him. I look as he nods and then continue to speak, "I just figured it was time to mend that bridge. I assume you're not here to talk to me about Shinji though?"  
“我想是渚薰告诉你的吧？”我问他，我并不完全惊讶他知道。如果不是渚薰告诉他的，那我想是他的人跟踪我们告诉他的。我看他点头，然后继续说，“我只是觉得是时候修复那座桥了。我猜你不是来跟我谈真嗣的吧？”

Fuyutsuki shakes his head, "No… I'm not. It is actually regarding Nagisa."  
冬月摇了摇头，“不……我不是。其实是关于渚的事情。”

His tone turns more serious and that little bit of apprehension I was feeling earlier returns. I already don't like the way this is going and I haven't heard anything yet.  
他的语气变得严肃起来，之前感受到的那一丝不安又回来了。我还没听到任何具体内容，就已经不喜欢这个走向了。

"Nagisa came to me not so long ago to speak about going to this concert in December. You see, Nagisa has to gain permission to travel outside of Germany."  
“不久前，渚来找我谈起十二月要去参加这场音乐会的事。你知道，渚需要获得离开德国的许可。”

I nod, "I'm aware, when we brought up the subject he did say that he would have to speak to you about it. I'm sure he gave you more than enough notice for you to give him the time off of work though."  
我点头，“我知道，当我们提起这个话题时，他确实说过需要和你谈谈。我相信他给了你足够的时间来安排他的休假。”

"It isn't about me giving him the time off of work." Fuyutsuki replies, "I am more than happy to grant Nagisa time off whenever he requests it."  
“这并不是关于我给他休假的问题。” 副校长回答，“我很乐意在渚请求时给他放假。”

"Okay, so what is the problem?" I ask him, still not liking the direction the conversation is taking.  
“好吧，那问题出在哪里？” 我问他，仍然不喜欢这场对话的走向。

"The people Nagisa has to get permission from is the UN Security Council. In truth I thought asking them would be a mere formality at this point. It has been several months since his return but…"  
"需要 Nagisa 获得许可的人是联合国安理会。实际上，我以为向他们申请只是个形式问题。他回来已经好几个月了，但是……"

Fuyutsuki trails off as I lean onto the couch and feel my nails dig into the soft leather. I have a strange feeling that the good mood I was previously in is about to be ruined. I take a deep breath to calm myself and try to remind myself that getting angry and yelling will achieve nothing. I need to remain clam.  
Fuyutsuki 话音渐弱，我靠在沙发上，感觉到指甲陷入了柔软的皮革中。我有一种奇怪的感觉，之前的好心情即将被破坏。我深吸一口气，试图让自己平静下来，并提醒自己，生气和吼叫无济于事。我需要保持冷静。

"…well since he has returned you must have seen it. The tests he's had to do and information he has handed over. I thought enough time had passed and enough had been done to prove his humanity and for them to see he was no longer a threat." Fuyutsuki explains to me, I can hear the anger in his voice. It's not dissimilar to the time he told me and Shinji off during our first mission together, "Those fools sent me an e-mail last night, denying his request to travel to Japan."  
"……好吧，既然他已经回来了，你肯定也看到了。他所做的测试和他提交的信息。我以为时间已经足够长，已经做了足够多的事情来证明他的人性和让他们看到他不再是一个威胁。" Fuyutsuki 向我解释道，我能听出他声音中的愤怒。这与他和我们在第一次任务中训斥我和 Shinji 时的语气并无二致，"那些蠢货昨晚给我发了一封电子邮件，拒绝了他前往日本的请求。"

"THEY HAVE DONE WHAT?" I yell loudly, I hear my voice echo throughout the apartment. So much for remaining calm and not yelling. I take a moment before I say anything else to try to put together something coherent. I speak again, not yelling this time but it is hard to hide the angry snarl in my voice, "How the hell could they do that? What more could he have possibly done to prove himself to them? He has complied with every single one of their requests and let's not forget this, it was THEIR people who attacked him weeks ago!"  
"他们干了什么？" 我大声吼道，听到自己的声音在公寓里回荡。看来保持冷静不喊叫是不可能了。我停顿了一下，试图组织出一些连贯的话。我再次开口，这次没有吼叫，但很难掩饰声音中的愤怒咆哮，"他们怎么可能做出这种事？他还能做些什么来向他们证明自己？他满足了他们每一个要求，而且别忘了，几周前袭击他的正是他们的人！"

Fuyutsuki does not disagree, "I know all of this and believe me I am thinking the exact same thing. You are not alone in your anger which is why I have come to you right now. I want you to know I am planning to fight this decision and will do everything I can. Yet I fear I cannot do this alone, I might need your help."  
冬月没有反驳，"我知道这一切，相信我，我也在想同样的事情。你的愤怒并非孤立无援，这也是我现在来找你的原因。我想让你知道，我打算反对这个决定，并会尽我所能。然而，我担心我不能独自完成这件事，我可能需要你的帮助。"

"My help?" "我的帮助？"

He nods and looks up at me, "I know you wished to have nothing to do with those people. I cannot blame you and I know you did not wish to have anything to do with me either but…"  
他点点头，抬头看着我，“我知道你希望与那些人毫无瓜葛。我不能怪你，我也知道你同样不希望与我有什么牵扯，但是……”

"I'll do it!" I interrupt him immediately. I don't even take a second to think about it, "If it will help him then I'll do it. If I need to go before them and speak my bit and fight for him then… I'll do it."  
“我会做的！”我立刻打断他。我甚至没有花一秒钟去思考，“如果这能帮助他，我就会去做。如果我需要在他们面前发言，为他争取，那么……我会做的。”

"Are you sure?" Fuyutsuki asks me, "They might ask you questions about your past, about your time fighting the Angels. It might conjure up unpleasant memories. Are you sure you want to put yourself through that?"  
“你确定吗？”冬月问我，“他们可能会问你关于你过去的问题，关于你与使徒战斗的时光。这可能会唤起不愉快的记忆。你确定要让自己经历这些吗？”

No, I don't want to remember any of that but… I love Kaworu and I want to fight for him. So if it means reliving some of that to get them to recognize his humanity and let him travel freely then I'll do it. I nod at Fuyutsuki, "Yes… In fact… I'll go one better."  
不，我不想回忆那些，但是……我爱着渚薰，我愿意为他而战。所以，如果这意味着要重温一些往事来让他们承认他的人性和自由旅行的权利，那我会去做。我向冬月点头，“是的……事实上……我会做得更好。”

As I speak those words a plan starts to form in my mind. I've always been good at coming up with workable plans on the spot. Look at my amazing tactics against the ninth Angel! Unfortunately at the moment I just have the idea and don't know how I'm going to do this yet. Still, I lived with Misato for nearly a year so it wouldn't be the craziest thing I've been a part of. I mean hell, I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I don't do failure.  
当我吐出这些话时，一个计划开始在我脑海中成型。我一直擅长即兴制定可行的计划。看看我对第九使徒的惊人战术吧！不幸的是，目前我只有这个想法，还不知道具体该怎么做。不过，我和美里同居了近一年，这不会是我参与过的最疯狂的事情。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，失败可不是我的风格。

"I'll get Shinji involved as well! I'll get him to help with this, if we both defend Kaworu then they can't say no can they? I mean we're two former pilots! Add to which them denying the two of us won't look great for them, considering we've let them off fairly easy!" I say with a grin.  
“我还会让真嗣参与进来！我会让他帮忙，如果我们俩都为渚薰辩护，他们就不能拒绝，对吧？我们可是两名前驾驶员！再加上，拒绝我们俩对他们来说可不是什么好形象，考虑到我们之前对他们还算宽容！”我带着一丝得意的笑容说道。

Fuyutsuki actually looked quite surprised at what I've said, "Would Ikari agree to such a thing? He has always seemed reluctant to have anything to do with the UN when they have asked before, nor has he really expressed a desire to speak with myself."  
冬月老师听到我的话后，显得颇为惊讶，“碇司令会同意这样的事吗？他之前对联合国提出的要求一直表现得不太情愿，也从未真正表达过与我交谈的意愿。”

"Don't worry about it, you do what you need to do and I'll sort out things with Shinji." I reassure him, "I'll handle telling Kaworu when he gets in as well."  
“别担心，你做你需要做的事，我会和真嗣处理好。”我安慰他，“等薰回来，我也会告诉他。”

"I see." Fuyutsuki rises from the seat, "In which case I will take my leave and get in touch with the necessary people to appeal against this. Once again… I am sorry about how this worked out. It was my hope that Nagisa could live a normal life away from these sorts of politics but… it was not to be."  
“我明白了。”冬月从座位上站起身，“那么，我将告辞并联系相关人士对此提出上诉。再次……对于事情发展到这一步，我深感抱歉。我本希望渚能远离这些政治纷争，过上正常的生活，但……事与愿违。”

"I am sure he will understand." Again, I reassure him, "You just speak to whoever you need to and let me know what I need to do. I'll do what I need to here."  
"我确信他会理解的。" 我又一次安慰他，"你只需与你需要的人交谈，并告诉我需要做什么。我会在这里做我该做的事。"

### Chapter 15: Keep Talking  
第十五章：继续交谈  

**1st October 2021 – Kaworu Nagisa  
2021 年 10 月 1 日 – 渚薰**

I approach the front door to the apartment feeling quite different to how I did when I left to go to work this morning. This morning I felt like there was something of a dark cloud hovering over me, I felt regret at the situation with Shinji. I was finding it hard to convince myself that things would work out. I did believe Asuka when she told me that she would work on fixing the situation but I also did not want to rely completely on her.  
我走向公寓的前门，感觉与今早出门上班时截然不同。今早，我感到头顶仿佛笼罩着一片乌云，对与真嗣的处境感到后悔。我很难说服自己事情会好转。当明日香告诉我她会努力解决问题时，我确实相信她，但也不想完全依赖她。

After the conversation with Rei my outlook changed. I felt as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I took some time afterwards to go and walk along the riverside as I said I would and contemplated the situation more. If Rei is able to forgive me despite her admitted hatred of myself then perhaps there is a chance for the situation to be fixed.  
与绫波的对话之后，我的心态发生了变化。我感觉肩上的重担被卸下了。之后，我如约去河边散步，进一步思考了当前的状况。如果绫波能原谅我，尽管她承认自己恨我，那么或许这个局面还有转机。

I unlock the door and step through, announcing my return as I kick off my shoes, "I'm home!"  
我打开门，一脚跨进去，脱鞋的同时宣告我的归来，“我回来了！”

I step through the small corridor into the main living space and see it emptier than it was when I left this morning. The stack of boxes containing all of Asuka's signed books have now gone and Asuka herself is not in the room. A few moments later I hear a muffled shout from our bedroom, "Welcome home!"  
我穿过狭小的走廊，进入主生活区，发现这里比今早离开时还要空荡。那一堆装着明日香签名书的箱子已经不见了，明日香本人也不在房间里。片刻后，我听到卧室里传来一声闷闷的喊声，“欢迎回家！”

I take a few steps towards the bedroom door and open it to see her kneeling down and stuffing a few items of clothing into one of the drawers. She looks up at me and smiles, I can see the sweat trickling down her forehead, "Give me a minute or two, I'm just finishing up sorting those boxes I brought over."  
我朝卧室门走了几步，推开门，看到她跪在地上，正把几件衣服塞进抽屉里。她抬头对我微笑，我可以看到汗水顺着她的额头流下，“给我一两分钟，我刚把那些搬来的箱子整理完。”

I nod and smile back at her, "Okay then."  
我点头回以微笑，“好的。”

I close the door behind me and the smile does not leave my lips. So Asuka has started to unpack her things and put them into the wardrobes and drawers. I was wondering if such a thing was going to happen. She has been starting here with me for a few weeks now, only returning to her apartment to bring more items over if necessary. As those weeks have gone on more and more of her possessions have been put out here.  
我关上身后的门，笑容依旧挂在唇边。看来明日香已经开始整理她的物品，放进衣柜和抽屉里了。我曾想过这样的情景是否会出现。她已经和我一起住在这里几周了，只是偶尔回公寓取些必需品。随着时间的推移，她的东西越来越多地出现在这里。

What was once a spacious and barren flat, occupied by an alien and consisting of a single book case with a television, basic furniture and a piano has now been expanded. We've added a couple more bookcases, an array of games consoles and even a small fake plant. It not feels less like an alien lives here and more like it's inhabited by a person. I suppose that is true, when I arrived her many months ago I did not know how to be human, I was an alien and as time has gone on I have become more human.  
曾经空旷而简陋的公寓，住着一个外星人，仅有一架书柜、一台电视、基本家具和一架钢琴，如今已大为改观。我们增添了几架书柜，各种游戏主机，甚至还有一盆小假植物。这里不再像住着外星人，而更像是一个人居住的地方。我想这是真的，几个月前我刚来时，还不懂如何做人，我是个外星人，但随着时间的流逝，我变得越来越像人类。

My ongoing transformation is not something I have accomplished alone. I have others to thank for it, Fuyutsuki for giving me the opportunity, Kodama for starting me on the journey and of course the person who will be living with me and the one I love, Asuka. It is weird to think that she is living with me. It was not something we have ever discussed, it is just something that seems to have happened organically. I'm not sure why it happened in this way, I would have been more than happy to move to hers and it might have been easier, it's not like I had a lot of possessions. Yet she decided to move here.  
我的持续转变并非我一人所能完成。我要感谢许多人，包括福津津吉给予我机会，儿玉引领我踏上旅程，当然还有将与我同住并深爱着的人——明日香。想到她与我同住，感觉颇为奇妙。我们从未讨论过此事，它似乎自然而然地发生了。我不确定为何会这样，我本愿意搬到她那里，或许那样更简单，毕竟我并没有太多财物。然而，她决定搬来这里。

I don't mind either way though. To know that I will be waking up every day to see her fills my heart with such joy. To know that I will continue to share meals with her, continue to play games, listen to music and watch movies, plan trips out makes me so very happy.  
不过，我对此并不介意。知道每天醒来都能见到她，我的心充满了喜悦。知道我们将继续共享餐食，玩游戏，听音乐，看电影，计划外出，让我感到无比幸福。

I sit myself down and wait for Asuka to come back into the room. A few moments later she does and I get another smile from her. Unfortunately, the smile fades fairly quickly and she lets out a sigh. I feel myself frown as I stand up to hug her, "Asuka, are you alright? Is everything okay?"  
我坐下来，等待明日香回到房间。片刻后她回来了，我又看到了她的微笑。遗憾的是，笑容很快消失，她叹了口气。我皱起眉头，站起来拥抱她，“明日香，你还好吗？一切都好吗？”

She nods at me, "It will be but..."  
她朝我点点头，“这将会是……”

She moves away from me and makes her way towards the window and looks out of it for a moment. I wonder what could be wrong and a number of scenarios fly through my mind. I try to ignore them for the moment.  
她从我身边走开，向窗户走去，向外望了一会儿。我不知道出了什么问题，脑海中闪过许多情景。我试图暂时忽略它们。

"...There is something I need to speak to you about. I wasn't sure when the best time to say it would be but I guess I should get it out of the way. I was visited by Fuyutsuki easier today."  
“……有件事我需要和你谈谈。我不确定什么时候说最合适，但我想还是早点说出来比较好。今天早些时候，我见到了冬月。”

I let out a sigh of relief as she says that. It is fortunately none of the scenarios that went through my mind. I am still concerned though, why would Fuyutsuki have visited her today?  
听到她这么说，我松了一口气。幸好不是我脑海中闪过的那些糟糕情景。不过我还是有些担心，为什么冬月今天会来看她呢？

"Fuyutsuki was here?" I ask.  
“冬月来过？”我问道。

She nods again, "Yes, he was here about your application to visit Japan in December."  
她再次点头，“是的，他是来谈你十二月申请去日本的事。”

"Ah... I see." I feel myself smile dryly and I can already guess from the look on her face what has happened. I suppose this explains why he wasn't at work today and why he said I should take the afternoon off. I go ahead and ask her to confirm it, "My application has been denied hasn't it?"  
"啊... 我明白了。" 我干笑了一下，从她的表情中已经猜到了发生了什么。我想这解释了为什么他今天没来上班，以及为什么他说我应该下午休息。我直接问她确认，"我的申请被拒绝了，对吧？"

"I'm sorry..." Asuka lowers her head.  
"我很抱歉..." 明日香低下头。

"Don't be..." I reply and shake my head. I find that for some reason I am still smiling, I'm not quite sure why. I'm not especially happy by the decision, I'm disappointed, I'm even a little bit angry by their decision. Yet, I also expected it in some way. I have known from the start that they haven't trusted me so this decision doesn't surprise me.  
"别这样..." 我回答并摇了摇头。不知为何，我发现自己仍在微笑，不太确定为什么。我对这个决定并不特别高兴，我感到失望，甚至对他们决定有点生气。然而，我也以某种方式预料到了。从一开始我就知道他们不信任我，所以这个决定并不让我感到意外。

"I'm going to fight it though." Asuka says, her voice quiet yet containing a fierce confidence, "I already told Fuyutsuki. I'll do whatever I can."  
"我还是要抗争到底。" 明日香说道，她的声音虽轻，却蕴含着坚定的自信，"我已经告诉了冬月。我会尽我所能。"

"Thank you." I nod, "I appreciate that."  
"谢谢你。" 我点头，"我很感激。"

She looks up at me, "It isn't fair that you should have to be restricted because they refuse to see the truth."  
她抬头看着我，"他们拒绝看清真相，你却因此受到限制，这不公平。"

I nod, "I know, I understand their fear… Humans are… fearful creatures, I have become well acquainted with the emotion myself since I have returned. I know how it can twist your logic, make you see things that aren't there but… I have also seen that it is something that people can overcome. I know you will make them see the reality of what I am."  
我点头，“我知道，我理解他们的恐惧……人类是……容易害怕的生物，自从我回来后，我自己也深切体会到了这种情感。我知道它如何扭曲你的逻辑，让你看到并不存在的东西，但是……我也看到了人们可以克服它。我知道你会让他们看清我真正的样子。”

"Damn right I will." She replies and smiles across at me, "It won't just be me as well, Shinji will speak to them as well."  
“当然会。”她回答，并朝我微笑，“不只是我，真嗣也会跟他们说的。”

"Shinji?" I look at her in confusion, "He agreed to do that?"  
“真嗣？”我困惑地看着她，“他同意这么做吗？”

"Not quite…" Asuka looks away sheepishly, "I… Might have told Fuyutsuki he would, I figured if we had two pilots speaking for you then they couldn't ignore us right? I mean… I know I could do it myself without any problems but I don't want to take any risks."  
“不太准确……” 明日香有些尴尬地别开视线，“我……可能告诉了冬月他会，我想如果我们有两个驾驶员为你说话，他们就不能忽视我们了，对吧？我是说……我知道我自己一个人也能搞定，但我不想冒任何风险。”

"Ah… I see…" I lower my eyes, "So he…"  
“啊……我明白了……” 我垂下眼帘，“所以他……”

"Look…" She cuts me off, "Just… don't worry about it, I know we have a lot to sort out but… just don't worry about it. If I didn't think I could sort it out then I wouldn't have said it. Just leave it to me."  
“听着……” 她打断了我，“只是……别担心了，我知道我们有很多事情要处理，但是……别担心。如果我不认为我能解决，我就不会说出来。交给我吧。”

**2nd October 2021 – Shinji Ikari  
2021 年 10 月 2 日 —— 碇真嗣**

It is a fairly warm day and I'm currently sat on my own in a small café near to the space we're using to rehearse in. We've just finished another practice session and I'm relaxing here with a warm cup of tea and my cello and backpack sat at my feet.  
今天天气相当暖和，我独自坐在离我们排练场地不远的一家小咖啡馆里。我们刚刚结束了一次练习，我在这里放松，手里捧着一杯热茶，大提琴和背包放在脚边。

I look around and see it's fairly busy for this time of the day, I suppose people are wanting to enjoy the little glimpses of warmer weather before it moves fully into Autumn. It is a variety of people out from businessmen and women on a break from work, students or the general population just out and about. Some of them are with a friend, some in groups or just on their own, not a single one of them looks at me as they go about their business, not a single one glances at me or notices me. No one here knows who I am.  
我环顾四周，发现这个时间段的咖啡馆相当热闹，我想人们是想在天气完全转凉之前享受这短暂的温暖时光。这里形形色色的人都有，有工作间隙休息的商务人士，有学生，也有普通市民外出闲逛。他们有的和朋友一起，有的成群结队，有的则独自一人，但没有任何一个人注意到我，他们各自忙碌，没有一个人瞥我一眼或注意到我。这里没有人认识我。

I... I do not feel afraid of these people as I sit here and sip my tea. I feel calm and safe here just as I always should have done. These people don't know who I am, they have never known who I am but for several years I've lived with that fear that someone or all of them will know. I've lived myself thinking that one day the world will wake up and know who Shinji Ikari was and all know of what it was he had done.  
我……我坐在这里品茶时，并不觉得这些人可怕。我感到平静和安全，就像我本该一直感受到的那样。这些人不知道我是谁，他们从未了解过我，但多年来我一直生活在恐惧中，担心某个人或所有人会知道。我曾以为有一天世界会醒来，知道碇真嗣是谁，以及他所做的一切。

This is not the first time I have noticed the freeing of myself from that fear. It's been happening more and more recently. As I've been going to and from rehearsals, as I've been spending more time talking to others I find I'm no longer as afraid as I used to me. I'm finding I no longer have that reliance on needing a friend with me when I go out. I am... I'm fine.  
这已经不是我第一次注意到自己从这种恐惧中解脱出来了。最近这种情况越来越频繁。当我往返于排练场地，当我花更多时间与他人交谈时，我发现我不再像以前那样害怕了。我发现我不再需要依赖朋友陪伴才能出门。我……我很好。

Although, I do know that this feeling may only be temporary and I need to ready myself for that. I need to know how to fight it, I know that there will be moments where I feel that fear again. It might happen when I'm in a store and I suddenly see someone out of the corner of my eye, it might happen when I'm on a crowded street or waiting for a bus of the train. I might feel that anxiety come back to me but I am trying, and I am getting better at fighting it.  
尽管我知道这种感觉可能只是暂时的，我需要为此做好准备。我得学会如何与之抗争，我知道会有那么一刻，恐惧感会再次袭来。也许是在商店里，我眼角余光突然瞥见某人；也许是在拥挤的街道上，或是在等公交或火车时。那种焦虑可能会再次找上我，但我正在努力，我正逐渐学会如何与之抗争。

As I slowly start to combat one worry it is replaced by another. A more understandable one perhaps, the upcoming concert is making me nervous. Rehearsals so far are going well; all of the group get along fine and we are managing to progress with learning the songs and arrangements without much difficulty. There are times when one or a couple of us might make a mistake but we will get it under control.  
当我慢慢克服一种担忧时，另一种担忧又取而代之。或许是更易理解的一种，即将到来的音乐会让我感到紧张。到目前为止，排练进展顺利；团队成员相处融洽，我们学习歌曲和编排的过程也没有遇到太多困难。有时，我们中的一两个可能会犯错，但我们能控制住局面。

I know on my end there are a few tricky sections to watch out for in some of the songs but I am practicing a lot at home so should be able to get it right. I even have something of an audience, Rei will sit and listen to me play and compare it to the original and she is even recording my playing to send to Asuka. It's not exactly the live audience of a couple of a thousand or so we're expecting when we put on the show but it is something.  
我知道在我这边，有些歌曲中有几处棘手的地方需要注意，但我正在家里大量练习，应该能够掌握。我甚至有了一个小观众，丽会坐下来听我演奏，并与原曲进行比较，她甚至还录制我的演奏视频发给明日香。虽然这并不是我们预计演出时面对的几千名观众，但总归是个开始。

I am worried about performing in front of an audience though. I've never done something like that before. Back when I started playing my teacher did try to get me to play for the class but I never wanted to. It was probably the only thing I refused to do, I was quite content to just practice on my own.  
不过，我对在观众面前表演感到担忧。我从未做过这样的事。当初我开始学琴时，老师确实试图让我在班上演奏，但我从未愿意。这可能是我唯一拒绝做的事情，我非常满足于独自练习。

I guess I was worried about what would happen to me if I did though. I never really had friends when I went to that school, I was always seen as a bit of a weird kid because of my family history. People spoke about me behind my back in whispers. There were rumours about my father and what sort of person I was.  
我想我当时担心如果我这么做会发生什么。在那所学校时，我从未真正有过朋友，因为我的家庭背景，我总是被视为有点古怪的孩子。人们在我背后窃窃私语。关于我父亲和我是什么样的人，有很多流言蜚语。

I guess it's no surprise I have issues with being fearful of people now. Even without what had happened five years ago it would probably still have been a problem.  
我想现在我对人感到恐惧并不奇怪。即使没有五年前发生的那件事，这问题可能依然存在。

So, I was worried that me doing such a thing, playing a cello, not exactly a fashionable activity would lead to me being bullied, more so than I was. Things will be different in November though, I'm not performing in front of a class of school children. I'm on stage in a theater, with a group and performing to an audience who wants to be there, who paid to be there.  
所以，我担心自己这样做，拉大提琴，并不是什么时尚活动，会让我比以前更受欺负。不过到了十一月，情况就不同了，我不是在教室里给一群小学生表演。我是在剧院的舞台上，和一群人一起，为那些愿意来、花钱来的人表演。

Amongst those people will be people I know too, people who have given so much love and support over the last few years. My family, Misato and Rei. Although I might not be blood related to Misato she has been more of a parent to me than anyone else I've been put in the care of over the course of my life.  
那些人中也会有我认识的人，过去几年里给予我很多爱和支持的人。我的家人，美里和绫。虽然我和美里没有血缘关系，但她比我在生活中遇到的任何其他照顾者都更像一个家长。

Rei, my sister, who has struggled over the last five years to find out who she truly is but has always been there for me.  
丽，我的姐姐，在过去五年里一直努力寻找真正的自我，但始终陪伴在我身边。

My close friends, Touji, Kensuke and Hikari will be there. They were the first proper friends I had in my life. It was rough to start off with but they have all helped me so much and been there for me.  
我的挚友们，东治、健介和光将会到场。他们是我生命中第一批真正的朋友。起初相处并不容易，但他们都给予了我极大的帮助，始终支持着我。

Finally, two more people will be there, people I haven't seen for a long time. Both of which I didn't expect to ever see again. Asuka... The girl I fell in love with many years ago, we had a... complicated friendship when she was here. I couldn't understand her and I don't think she could understand me. We both hurt each other and when she left five years ago I never thought I'd see her again.  
最后，还有两位久未谋面的人也将出席，这两位我本以为此生再无缘相见。明日香……多年前我深爱的女孩，她在这里时，我们的友情颇为复杂。我无法理解她，我想她也无法理解我。我们彼此伤害，五年前她离开时，我从未想过还能再见到她。

Kaworu is the other person I never expected to see again. Kaworu died, people don't normally come back after death... well except for Asuka, Misato and Ritsuko but that was different, they were killed just on the cusp of Third Impact. Kaworu wasn't, he was killed days before so surely, he wouldn't have been caught up in it, right?  
渚薰是我从未预料到会再次见到的人。渚薰已经死了，人们通常不会死后复生...嗯，除了明日香、美里和律子，但那是不同的，她们是在第三次冲击即将发生时被杀的。渚薰不是，他在那之前几天就被杀死了，所以按理说，他不应该被卷入其中，对吧？

I guess it's too much for me to understand, maybe someone smarter like Ritsuko would make sense of it but does it matter about why? The fact is that he has returned and I will be seeing him again in December. I need to prepare for that, I just hope that things are... better between us by that time.  
我想这对我来说太难理解了，也许像律子那样聪明的人能搞清楚，但为什么重要吗？事实是他已经回来了，我将在十二月再次见到他。我需要为此做好准备，我只希望到那时我们之间的关系...能有所改善。

I do feel bad about upsetting him the other day. I... never wanted to upset anyone, I hate the idea that I could have been responsible for hurting someone. I hate being hurt myself so the idea of me doing that to someone else upsets me. Most of the time if I'm upset with someone or annoyed with something I'll just not say anything, I'll keep it bottled up.  
我对前几天让他难过感到很抱歉。我...从不想让任何人难过，我讨厌自己可能是伤害别人的原因。我自己也讨厌被伤害，所以想到自己可能伤害了别人让我很难过。大多数时候，如果我对某人感到不满或对某事感到恼火，我只会保持沉默，把情绪憋在心里。

I have argued and disagreed with people in the past. I've had arguments with Rei, Misato and when she was here Asuka but I hated it. I always felt awful afterwards and I was also the first to apologize even if I wasn't at fault.  
我过去曾与人争论和意见不合。我和丽、美里还有阿斯卡争吵过，但我讨厌那样。事后我总是感到糟糕透顶，而且即使不是我的错，我也总是第一个道歉。

This is how I feel about the situation with Kaworu. I feel awful for upsetting him and being angry at him even though I know I am justified in being upset and angry at him. Everyone understands why I'm that way, even Asuka understands that and she is his friend. When Kaworu spoke to me even he understood that.  
我对与薰之间的情况就是这种感觉。我为他感到难过，也为对他发怒而感到内疚，尽管我知道自己有理由感到不安和愤怒。每个人都能理解我为什么这样，就连阿斯卡也明白，她是他的朋友。就连薰自己和我说话时也理解这一点。

What he did to me all those years ago hurt me, in fact it went beyond hurting me. His actions, whether he meant it or not pushed me to a point lower than I had ever been before. I realize now that it was not just his betrayal and then revealing himself to be an Angel that hurt me, it was the fact that he made me kill him. Kaworu... knowing what it was like to pilot an Eva asked me to kill him, after already hurting me he made me do that.  
多年前他对我的所作所为伤害了我，实际上，这伤害远超我的想象。无论他是有意还是无意，他的行为将我推到了前所未有的低谷。我现在意识到，不仅仅是他的背叛和他后来暴露出的天使身份伤害了我，更重要的是，他让我亲手杀了他。薰……知道驾驶 EVA 是什么感觉的他，在已经伤害了我之后，还让我去做那件事。

I felt every part of it as well. I could feel his body within the grasp of Unit 01s hand as if it was within my own hand. I could feel it as his body was crushed leaving barely a trace of it to clean away from the hand of that damn Evangelion. I don't think that he, no I don't think that anyone could ever understand how that felt. No one should ever have to understand it.  
我同样感受到了这一切。我仿佛能感觉到他的身体被初号机紧握在手中，就像握在我自己的手中一样。我能感受到他的身体被碾压，几乎不留痕迹，只能从那该死的 EVA 手中清理掉残余。我想，他，不，我想没有人能真正理解那种感觉。没有人应该去理解这种感受。

I have thought about those moments so many times. I have had nightmares about it and since I was told of his return I've had more. A part of me always wanted to be forgiven for having to kill him and another part of me always felt that it should have been me rather than him. I even felt like I should have been punished for killing another human, despite him not actually being human.  
我无数次回想起那些时刻。我为此做过噩梦，自从得知他归来后，噩梦更多了。我总希望自己能被原谅，因为我不得不杀了他；而另一部分的我则始终觉得，本应是我而不是他。我甚至觉得自己应该因为杀害了一个“人”而受到惩罚，尽管他实际上并非人类。

Kaworu returning was something I never prepared myself for. It was not something I ever imagined unlike the idea of Asuka making contact again. To me the idea of Kaworu returning would have been similar to the idea of seeing my father again, it just wasn't something that was going to happen. So, I don't really know how to handle it.  
渚薰的归来是我从未准备面对的。这与想象明日香再次联系的情况不同。对我来说，渚薰的归来就像再次见到我父亲一样，这根本是不可能发生的事。所以，我真的不知道该如何应对。

I guess, now that I've had time to think about it I know that I want to hear him out properly. I want to try to forgive him if I can. I don't want to hate someone, I don't want to go my life being angry at someone and I know... there is more to his story than I know. I just... I wasn't ready to hear it when I call him. When I heard his voice, when I heard him try to explain I got scared, I just couldn't handle it. So, I did what I do best, I ran away.  
我想，现在有时间思考了，我知道我想好好听他说。如果可以的话，我想尝试原谅他。我不想恨某个人，不想一生气就过日子，而且我知道……他的故事比我了解的要多。我只是……我打电话给他时还没准备好听这些。当我听到他的声音，当他试图解释时，我害怕了，我无法承受。所以，我做了我最擅长的事，我逃走了。

I know that I should speak to Asuka about it all properly too. I've been avoiding doing that since it happened though. I'm worreid that Asuka is going to be mad at me, I'd understand it if she was. After all, I did upset her friend, if someone had upset someone like Rei then I'd be mad at them too. In fact, I was, I upset Rei the other week and spent a good amount of time being angry at myself.  
我知道我也应该和明日香好好谈谈这一切。尽管自从事情发生后我一直在回避这样做。我担心明日香会生我的气，如果她生气了，我也能理解。毕竟，我确实让她的朋友不高兴了，如果有人让像丽这样的人不高兴，我也会生他们的气。事实上，我确实如此，前几天我让丽不高兴了，花了很多时间生自己的气。

I pick up my phone and scroll to Asuka's contact page. I hesitate as my thumb hovers over the call button. In the back of my mind I can already hear that voice telling me this is pointless, that she is probably angry at me and doesn't want to hear from me.  
我拿起手机，滚动到明日香的联系页面。我的拇指悬在通话按钮上犹豫不决。在我脑海深处，我已经能听到那个声音告诉我这是徒劳的，她可能生我的气，不想听到我的消息。

I hate that voice so much. My thumb makes contact with the screen and I wait for her to answer. It rings a couple of times and then she answers, _"Hello, Shinji?"_  
我讨厌那个声音讨厌得要命。我用拇指触碰屏幕，等待她接电话。铃声响了几下，然后她接了，“喂，真嗣？”

"H-Hey Asuka, are you okay?"  
“呃-嘿，明日香，你还好吗？”

_"Yeah, pretty good. I was going to call you later on today actually!"  
“嗯，挺好的。其实我正打算今天晚些时候给你打电话呢！”_

She doesn't sound mad at me when she speaks, I allow myself a little sigh of relief.  
她说话时听起来并不生我的气，我暗自松了一口气。

"Oh!" I reply to her, "I just... I know Rei already spoke to you but I thought I should apologize for upsetting Kaworu the other day."  
“哦！”我回答她，“我只是……我知道丽已经和你谈过了，但我觉得我应该为前几天让薰不开心而道歉。”

_"Really?"_ I can hear the confusion in her voice. I guess she probably doesn't think I have anything to apologize for.  
“真的吗？”我能听出她声音中的困惑。我想她可能觉得我没什么需要道歉的。

I nod my head, "Y-Yeah... I... I shouldn't have contacted him immediately after you suggested it. I... I wasn't ready so... I'm sorry."  
我点点头，“嗯...我...我不该在你提议后立刻联系他。我...我还没准备好，所以...对不起。”

_"You're right... you shouldn't have done..."_ Asuka lets out a sigh, _"But I guess I can't blame you for being impulsive we all have our moments."_  
“你说得对...你不该这么做...”明日香叹了口气，“不过我想我也不能怪你冲动，我们都有那样的时刻。”

"I know but... I should have known better." I offer in reply before following up, "Also... I spoke to my teacher, I was able to get tickets put aside so if he wants to be here in December then... I'm happy to have him here."  
“我知道，但是...我应该更明白的。”我回答道，接着补充说，“还有...我和老师谈过了，我设法留了票，所以如果他想十二月来的话...我很高兴他能来。”

There is a bit of a lengthy pause and I start to wonder if maybe the call has been dropped, I hear a small amount of shuffling from the other side indicating she is still there though, "Asuka?"  
电话那头沉默了一会儿，我开始怀疑是不是通话断了，但随即听到对方那边传来轻微的响动，表明她还在，“Asuka？”

_"I see..."_ She finally speaks, _"That's good but... there has been a... problem."_  
“我明白了……”她终于开口，“那挺好的，但是……出了点问题。”

Her voice has gone quiet and little familiar worries come rushing back to me. Has something happened to her? Does she not want to come anymore? Did something happen between herself and Kaworu? She sounded happy a moment ago and then I mentioned Kaworu and all of a sudden that was lost. Did he hurt her in some way?  
她的声音变得低沉，那些熟悉的担忧又涌上心头。她出什么事了吗？她不想来了吗？她和 Kaworu 之间发生了什么吗？她刚才听起来还很开心，我一提到 Kaworu，那种喜悦就突然消失了。他是不是以某种方式伤害了她？

I don't get a chance to ask anything myself. Asuka speaks again, only this time there is anger in her voice, _"Kaworu has been told he can't go to Japan."_  
我自己没机会问任何问题。明日香再次开口，只是这次她的声音中带着怒气，“渚薰被告知不能去日本。”

I wait for a follow up to her words, for her to reveal maybe this was some weird joke that I just haven't understood. The anger in her voice tells me that this is no joke and no follow up actually comes. Instead I sit in silence trying to fully grasp the meaning of what she has said.  
我等待她的话后续，期待她揭示这或许是个我还没理解的奇怪玩笑。但她声音中的愤怒告诉我这不是玩笑，也没有后续。我只能沉默地坐着，试图完全理解她所说的话的含义。

"What do you mean?" I finally ask.  
“你这是什么意思？”我终于问道。

_"Exactly what I said!"_ She replies instantly, the anger in her voice replaced by annoyance, _"Kaworu has been told he can't go to Japan!"_  
“正是我说的那样！”她立刻回应，声音中的愤怒被不悦所取代，“渚薰被告知不能去日本！”

"I know that but... why?" I ask her. I still don't really understand, why would Kaworu be unable to come to Japan. Who would stop him from coming over? This doesn't make sense.  
“我知道，但是...为什么？”我问她。我仍然不太明白，为什么渚薰不能来日本。谁会阻止他过来？这说不通。

I hear Asuka let out a sigh, _"They, the UN Security Council have decided they don't trust him. Actually, they have never done, they don't believe he is fully human yet and think he is still up to something. So, they've said no. I was going to call you and tell you later."_  
我听到明日香叹了口气，“他们，联合国安理会，决定不信任他。实际上，他们从未信任过他，他们不相信他是完全的人类，还认为他另有图谋。所以，他们拒绝了。我本来打算晚点打电话告诉你的。”

"So... Does that mean Kaworu won't be coming?" I ask her.  
"那么...这是不是意味着卡罗不会来了？" 我问她。

She replies instantly, _"No, Kaworu WILL be coming!"_  
她立刻回答，"不，卡罗会来的！"

"but you just said..." "但你刚刚说..."

She interrupts me, _"I know what I said, but what I said has happened and what is going to happen are different things. Kaworu will be coming to Japan in December. You said you wanted him there, right?"_  
她打断我，“我知道我说的，但我说的已经发生和将要发生的，是两码事。卡沃鲁会在十二月来日本。你说过希望他在那儿，对吧？”

"What do you mean?" I can already hear her annoyance as soon as the words leave my lips.  
“你什么意思？”话一出口，我就能听出她的不悦。

_"Do you want Kaworu to be there in December? Do you actually want to see him again? Do you feel comfortable with the idea of having him there? After the other day I need to know, otherwise there is no point..."  
“你希望卡沃鲁十二月在那儿吗？你真的想再见到他吗？你对他出现在那儿感到自在吗？那天之后我需要知道，否则就没有意义了……”_

I take a moment to think about it. I've already said to her I want him there, I've already put aside a ticket but I actually think about it properly. Do I genuinely want him there? Would I be better off not seeing him? I feel like I should discuss this with Rei or Misato first but it also seems like I don't have that luxury. I have to go with what I said before, yes, I do want him there.  
我花了一点时间认真思考。我已经告诉她我希望他在那里，已经预留了一张票，但我现在真的在仔细考虑。我真心希望他在那里吗？不见他我会不会更好？我觉得应该先和丽或美里商量一下，但似乎我没有这个余裕。我必须坚持之前的说法，是的，我确实希望他在那里。

_"Shinji?" "真嗣？"_

Asuka's impatient prompting brings me back to reality, I feel myself nod again, "I... Yes, I would."  
明日香不耐烦的催促让我回到了现实，我感到自己再次点头，“我……是的，我愿意。”

"Yeah I..." I pause for a moment, even if I didn't want him here it wouldn't be right for me to say no. He has the right to come here, doesn't he?  
“是啊，我……”我停顿了一下，即使我不想让他来，我也不应该说不同意。他有权利来这里，不是吗？

"I know it didn't go well the other day but... I trust what you've told me. If you say he is worth listening to and you're his friend then... I can't say no. It'd be unfair."  
"我知道那天情况不太好，但是……我相信你告诉我的。如果你说他值得倾听，而且你是他的朋友，那么……我不能拒绝。那会不公平。"

_"Good, that makes the next part a little bit easier then."_ Asuka pauses and I get a strange feeling of dread, _"I told him and Fuyutsuki that me and you would get the security council to see sense and let him travel."_  
"很好，那接下来的部分就容易一些了。" 明日香停顿了一下，我感到一种莫名的恐惧，"我告诉他和冬月，我和你会说服安全委员会，让他们同意他出行。"

"Oh, okay then." I smile, that sounds reasonable and I start to lift my tea to my lips to take another sip. The rim of the cup reaches my lips and then I realize exactly what it is Asuka has just said. I slowly set the cup down with a horrified look on my face, "Wait... WHAT?"  
"哦，好吧。" 我微笑着，听起来很合理，我正要举起茶杯再喝一口。杯子边缘触到我的嘴唇，然后我突然意识到明日香刚才说了什么。我缓缓放下杯子，脸上露出惊恐的表情，"等等……什么？"

_"I said the Security Council would be made to see sense!"  
"我说过安理会会明白道理的！"_

"No, before that!" "不，在那之前！"

_"I was just making sure you wanted him over here."_ She expertly avoids the part I mean.  
""我只是确认一下你是不是真的想让他过来。"" 她巧妙地避开了我指的那部分。

"Not that part, between you asking me and saying that they'd see sense, you said... me and... you?"  
"不是那部分，在你问我之后和说他们会明白之前，你说了...我和...你？"

"Oh... Yeah I... Told Kaworu and Fuyutsuki that me and you would get them to see sense..."  
"哦...是的，我...告诉了渚薰和冬月，我和你会让他们明白的..."

She actually sounds sheepish when she says it, I on the other hand feel fear, "Me... and you?"  
她说起这话时真的显得有些不好意思，而我则感到恐惧，"我...和你？"

_"Yes! I mean... I could of course do it all by myself, I am more than capable."_ She boasts to me, _"But... I figured I didn't want there to be any risks, they might still refuse to hear me out. You know what old men can be like. I figured having two pilots there would be better than one and ensure they can't refuse."_  
"是的！我是说...我当然可以自己搞定一切，我完全有能力。" 她向我夸口道，"但是...我觉得不想有任何风险，他们可能仍然会拒绝听我解释。你知道那些老头子是什么样的。我想有两个飞行员在场会比一个更好，确保他们无法拒绝。"

"I-I see..." Her words make sense but do little to make me feel any less scared.  
"我...我明白了..." 她的话虽然有道理，但并没有让我感到不那么害怕。

_"It's not even like you'd have to do much, just follow my lead and it'll be fine. You know, just like you did when we beat the Ninth Angel, just there will be less acid I suppose."  
"你甚至不需要做太多，只要跟着我的引导就行了，一切都会顺利的。你知道的，就像我们打败第九使徒时那样，只是这次应该不会有那么多酸液了。"_

I have nothing to offer in reply to that, I can feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest with each word. What she is saying does make sense but... I can't do something like that. Even if I did follow her lead I'd probably still mess it up. This isn't like piloting an Eva, this is... so different. I mean, I messed up speaking to Kaworu so how can I possibly do this?  
对此我无言以对，每听她说一个字，我的心就狂跳不已。她的话确实有道理，但是...我做不到那样的事。即便我跟随她的引导，恐怕还是会搞砸。这不像驾驶 EVA，这是...如此不同。我的意思是，我跟渚薰说话都搞砸了，我怎么可能做到这个？

"I... I don't know if I can Asuka..." I admit to her and lower my head in shame. I'm being truthful though, I really don't know if I could do something like this.  
“我...我不知道我能不能做到，明日香...”我向她坦白，羞愧地低下头。虽然我说的是实话，我真的不确定自己能否做到这样的事。

I expect her to reply immediately and angrily, I expect to hear her shout at me and tell me to be a man. I'm being unfair on her but I can hear her old voice from years ago, asking me if I'm stupid or what kind of man I am. She doesn't do any of that though, I hear that shuffling sound on the phone again and I speak again, "I'm sorry Asuka but..."  
我以为她会立刻愤怒地回应，以为会听到她对我大喊大叫，让我像个男人一样。我对她不公平，但我能听到她多年前那熟悉的声音，问我是不是傻了，或者我算什么男人。然而她没有那样做，我又听到了电话那头窸窸窣窣的声音，于是我再次开口：“对不起，明日香，但是...”

I'm cut off, "Please... Shinji I... I can't do this alone."  
我被切断了，“请……真嗣，我……我一个人做不到。”

Her reply surprises me and she continues, _"I... I'm frightened I'll mess it up. I... Me and you... When we worked together, when we fought together there was nothing that could stop us. It'll... It'll be the same this time... I... I need you."_  
她的回答让我惊讶，她继续说，“我……我害怕会搞砸。我……我和你……当我们一起工作，一起战斗时，没有什么能阻挡我们。这次……这次也会是一样的……我……我需要你。”

My mouth goes dry and the rapid beating of my heart continues, "But... I wouldn't know what to do or say. I don't really know who Kaworu is, how could I help?"  
我的嘴巴发干，心跳依旧急促，“但是……我不知道该做什么或说什么。我并不真正了解渚薰是谁，我怎么能帮忙呢？”

_"How should I know? You think I have any idea of what to do or say either?"_ She asks me, _"I don't know Shinji, I don't know what to do but I'm not going to let them do this. We just have to show he can be trusted right? We need them to see he is human and that we want him to be there. Think about who we are, we were hurt the most by what happened, so if we can say he can be trusted then... they'll have to take notice, won't they?"_  
"我怎么知道？你以为我有任何主意该怎么做或说什么吗？" 她问我，"我不知道，真嗣，我不知道该怎么做，但我不会让他们这样做的。我们只需要证明他值得信任，对吧？我们需要让他们看到他是人类，而且我们希望他在那里。想想我们是谁，我们是最受伤害的人，所以如果我们能说他是可信的，那么...他们就不得不注意了，不是吗？"

"I... I guess... Do you really think I can help?"  
"我...我想...你真的认为我能帮忙吗？"

_"I know you can."_ She answers me, _"Shinji you... You know who I am, you know how much I hate asking for help but... I need your help, please... I can't do this alone."_  
"我知道你能。" 她回答我，"真嗣，你...你知道我是谁，你知道我有多讨厌求助，但是...我需要你的帮助，请...我不能独自完成这件事。"

A part of me is still pulling to say no, to turn it down. I'm scared that I'll mess this up somehow but if she needs my help then how can I really say no?  
我的一部分仍在抗拒，想要拒绝，想要推辞。我害怕自己会搞砸这一切，但如果她需要我的帮助，我又怎能真正说出口拒绝呢？

"Okay I... I'll do what I can."  
“好吧，我……我会尽力而为。”

_"Thank you." "谢谢你。"_

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I feel a deep sense of unease as I step through the security checkpoint and look towards a waiting Misato. I do not yet know why she has asked me to come to this place. All she has told me is that there are some things here for me to see. There has been no indication of what these things might be as of yet.  
当我穿过安检口，望向等待着的美里时，心中涌起一股深深的忧虑。我还不清楚她为何要我来到这个地方。她只告诉我这里有几样东西要给我看。至于这些究竟是什么，至今仍未有任何提示。

I have tried to figure out just what it might be that is here but on the journey to this place I was unable to do so. I cannot imagine where might be left here for me in this city that I once called my home, in this city that was once my prison.  
我曾试图弄清楚这里究竟有什么，但在前往此地的旅途中，我未能找到答案。我无法想象在这座我曾称之为家的城市里，在这座曾是我的牢笼的城市里，还有什么地方留给我。

By all rights there should not be anything left of myself here. My apartment and meagre belongings were destroyed. The laboratories within NERV that I was created and raised in were also surely destroyed too. As far as I can see there is nothing left for me here, so why am I here? What could they possibly have found that has any relevance to me?  
按理说，这里应该没有任何属于我的东西了。我的公寓和微薄的财物已被摧毁。我在 NERV 中诞生并成长的研究室也肯定被毁了。就我所见，这里已无我容身之地，那我为何还在这儿？他们究竟发现了什么与我相关的东西？

As I walk towards Misato I look around my environment. We currently sit on the outskirts of what was once Tokyo-3. The land here is tinged with a burnt red and the scenes before me show nothing but abandoned and half destroyed buildings. Most curious of all is that nature does not seem to have dared to reclaim any of this land, perhaps it is allowing the city to remain as a permanent scar upon the Earth, serving as a reminder to humanity of the mistakes it once made.  
当我走向美里时，我环顾四周的环境。我们目前位于曾是第三新东京市的郊外。这片土地泛着焦红，眼前尽是废弃和半毁的建筑。最奇怪的是，自然似乎不敢收回这片土地，也许它让这座城市作为地球上永久的伤疤，提醒人类曾经犯下的错误。

Truthfully, I am surprised that anything is left at all of this place. That which the JSSDF did not destroy when they attacked us must surely have been destroyed when I completed the forbidden union of Lilith and Adam within myself. Third Impact saw the Black Moon rise up, there should not be anything here. Still I would not dare to try and understand the strange sciences and logic at play on that day. Perhaps I should not focus on how or why this is, and just accept that it Is the way it is.  
说实话，我对这个地方居然还剩下些什么感到惊讶。日本自卫队攻击我们时未摧毁的东西，肯定在我体内完成了莉莉丝与亚当的禁忌结合后被摧毁了。第三次冲击让黑月升起，这里本不该留下任何东西。但我还是不敢尝试去理解那天发生的奇异科学和逻辑。也许我不该纠结于这是如何或为何发生的，而只是接受它就是这样。

With each step I get a strange feeling within myself, as if there is something or someone watching over me. It is a familiar feeling but one I have not felt in many years. I try to ignore it, it is surely just my mind playing tricks on me as a result of my presence in this place.  
每走一步，我内心都有种奇怪的感觉，仿佛有什么东西或某个人在注视着我。这是一种熟悉的感觉，但我已经很多年没有感受到了。我试图忽视它，这肯定是由于我身处此地，我的大脑在捉弄我。

Misato nods at me and we move towards a large 4x4 and get inside. The driver greets Misato and she tells him that we are ready to get moving. I put my seatbelt on just as the vehicle starts to pull away, ahead of us is another 4x4 and a there is a third one behind us. I look from the window to Misato, "Why am I here?"  
美里向我点头示意，我们走向一辆大型四驱车并坐了进去。司机向美里打招呼，她告诉他我们准备出发了。我刚系好安全带，车子就开始驶离，前方还有一辆四驱车，后面也有一辆。我从车窗望向美里，“我为什么在这里？”

As I ask her I see us pass a still standing building housing a familiar sight. It is a small café, I came here once with Shinji and Asuka. I had green tea and tried Black Forest gateaux for the first time. I believe I also had pocky for the first time on that day. That was day was a warm day but overcast with grey clouds, my memories of it are nice and it brings me sadness to see the state of the café now.  
当我问她时，我看到我们经过一栋依然矗立的建筑，里面有着熟悉的景象。那是一家小咖啡馆，我曾和真嗣与明日香来过这里。我喝了绿茶，第一次尝试了黑森林蛋糕。我想那天也是我第一次吃百奇饼干。那是个温暖但多云的日子，灰色的云层密布，我对那天的记忆很美好，但看到咖啡馆现在的状况，我不禁感到悲伤。

Misato speaks as our journey continues, "We found something when we were exploring NERV, a few things actually."  
随着我们的旅程继续，美里说道：“我们在探索 NERV 时发现了一些东西，实际上是几样东西。”

"And these things concern me?" I ask.  
“这些东西让我担心吗？”我问道。

She nods, "Most of it, yes. The other thing... It'd be best to see if for yourself, I... I don't know if you will understand it but at the moment you're one of the only ones who could. I can't really say more until we arrive there unfortunately."  
她点点头，“大部分是的。另一件事……最好你自己亲眼看看，我……我不知道你是否能理解，但目前你是少数可能理解的人之一。很遗憾，在我们到达那里之前，我无法多说。”

Her words pique my curiosity and I begin to wonder what could be down there. Nothing is coming to mind, as it was I had very few possessions. I am even more curious to learn about what this other thing is. It is somewhat frustrating that Misato cannot tell me now, but I understand the many layers of security in place.  
她的话激起了我的好奇心，我开始猜测下面可能有什么。脑海中一片空白，毕竟我拥有的东西本就不多。我对这个“另一件事”更加好奇了。Misato 现在不能告诉我，虽然有些沮丧，但我理解这层层安保的必要性。

I wonder what could be left of the NERV building, if these things concern me then I assume they were found in my old rooms amidst the lower levels. This means the laboratories that I was born in and visited frequently for checkups and testing, it means the Dummy Plug facility that was also home to the spare bodies of mine, it means the room that acted as a perfect mirror of my own apartment.  
"我想知道 NERV 大楼还剩下什么，如果这些事让我担忧，那它们应该是在我以前的房间里，位于较低的楼层。这意味着我出生的实验室，经常去进行检查和测试的地方，意味着也是我备用身体存放地的 Dummy Plug 设施，意味着那个与我公寓完全相同的房间。”

I am fearful of seeing any of those things again, unlike the memories of the café the ones I have of those places are not pleasant. The memories of needles and sickness, of lies and secrets, the memories of the tests and being made to stand naked in large tanks whilst I was poked and prodded. Worst of all are the memories of him, the father who abandoned his son, and the father who created a daughter from the ashes of his wife only to use it as a tool for his own gain. I do not wish to be here.  
我害怕再次见到那些东西，与咖啡馆的记忆不同，我对那些地方的记忆并不愉快。关于针头和疾病的记忆，关于谎言和秘密的记忆，关于测试和被迫赤身裸体站在大水箱中被戳戳弄弄的记忆。最糟糕的是关于他的记忆，那个抛弃儿子的父亲，以及那个从妻子灰烬中创造出女儿只为利用她谋取私利的父亲。我不想待在这里。

I suddenly feel a warm hand on top of mine, it squeezes it gently and I turn to see Misato smiling at me, "I'm sorry to bring you back to this place Rei, I know it is probably the last place you would want to be right now."  
我突然感到一只温暖的手放在我的手上，它轻轻地握住我的手，我转头看到美里微笑着对我说：“很抱歉带你回到这个地方，丽，我知道这可能是你现在最不想待的地方。”

"That is true." I admit to her, "But... I know what you are doing is important and if I can aid in that I will do so. I would not want to put a barrier in your way."  
“确实如此。”我向她承认，“但是……我知道你所做的工作很重要，如果我能为此出一份力，我会去做的。我不想成为你的阻碍。”

Our journey continues in silence for a couple more minutes and Misato speaks to me again, "How does it feel for you, to be back here?"  
我们的旅程在沉默中又持续了几分钟，Misato 再次对我说话，“回到这里，你感觉如何？”

"It makes me feel uneasy." I answer as I once again feel that strange sensation of someone watching me, "I did not expect there to be anything left of the city or NERV itself. Nor did I think I would ever return here, it makes me feel... uneasy."  
“这让我感到不安。”我回答道，再次感受到那种被人注视的奇怪感觉，“我没想到城市或 NERV 还会有任何残留。我也没想过我会再回到这里，这让我感到...不安。”

She nods, "I know what you mean, we saw this whole thing be destroyed, it isn't... natural for it to be like this."  
她点点头，“我明白你的意思，我们亲眼目睹了这一切被摧毁，现在这样...不自然。”

There is a pause before she speaks again, "To tell you the truth, I didn't ever want to come back here either. When we first started looking into this I had hoped there would be nothing left but a hole in the ground. I didn't want to come back."  
她停顿了一下，然后再次开口，“说实话，我其实也不想再回到这里。当我们最初开始调查这件事时，我曾希望这里只剩下一个空洞。我不想回来。”

Her words confuse me, as far as I was aware she had to go to a lot of effort to get the opportunity to come back here. Surely, she must have wanted to do so, "Then why did you come back?"  
她的话让我困惑，据我所知，她为了能回到这里付出了很多努力。显然，她一定是有回来的意愿，“那你为什么还要回来？”

She shrugs, "It's something I've been asking myself for a while. I could have left it alone and not gotten involved but... I couldn't."  
她耸了耸肩，“这个问题我已经问过自己很久了。我本可以置之不理，不参与其中，但……我做不到。”

"Why not?" “为什么不呢？”

"Fear, I was scared that if they found something here then they wouldn't do the right thing with it, that it could lead to something bad happening. At least with me here I can try to make sure that doesn't happen... I can protect people."  
“恐惧，我害怕如果他们在这里发现了什么，就不会正确处理它，可能会导致不好的事情发生。至少我在这里，我可以尽力确保这种情况不会发生...我可以保护人们。”

"I see." “我明白了。”

She lets out a sigh, "I guess... A part of me also got caught up believing that there might have been something here that could help the world."  
她叹了口气，“我想...我的一部分也陷入了相信这里可能有什么能帮助世界的东西。”

"It is understandable, do you no longer believe that?"  
"这是可以理解的，你不再相信了吗？"

She shakes her head, "No, I don't. I'm starting to agree with Ritsuko, I think anything we do find should be destroyed. Humanity can go on without the things that NERV created."  
她摇了摇头，"不，我不信了。我开始同意律子的观点，我认为我们找到的任何东西都应该被销毁。人类可以在没有 NERV 创造的这些东西的情况下继续生存。"

I contemplate her words as the car continues its journey through the city. I have noticed that we are now travelling downwards into the main Geofront itself, we move through a series of tunnels and I can see the vast underground space before me. There is a wide hole above where the centre of the city once stood, allowing sunlight to pour into the chamber.  
我沉思着她的话，车子继续在城市中穿行。我注意到我们现在正向下进入主 Geofront，穿过一系列隧道，我能看到眼前广阔的地下空间。曾经是城市中心的上方有一个巨大的洞口，让阳光倾泻进这个地下大厅。

From this point I can see the lake, now much wider than it used to be after the large number of battles that took place in and around it. Other relics of battle litter the landscape, fallen farmhouses and torn up fields. At the edge of the lake is the gigantic form of the NERV pyramid. My stomach twists into a knot as I lay my eyes on it for the first time in years.  
从这里，我可以望见湖面，如今它比以往宽阔许多，那是在湖区及其周边发生的大量战斗之后。战火的遗迹遍布四周，倒塌的农舍和毁坏的田野。湖畔矗立着 NERV 那巨大的金字塔形建筑。当我多年后首次将目光投向它时，我的胃不禁紧缩成一团。

"It is… intact, such a thing is impossible."  
“它……完好无损，这简直不可能。”

I turn to Misato to see her nod, "I know… We all thought the same thing."  
我转向美里，只见她点头道，“我知道……我们都曾这么想。”

As we creep closer the various things I was feeling intensify, the unease, the fear and the feeling of something watching. I wish I could leave but I cannot, I have to see this through now. Thankfully we soon arrive at the security checkpoint, we are moved through it.  
随着我们逐渐靠近，我感受到的各种情绪愈发强烈，不安、恐惧以及被注视的感觉。我真希望能离开，但现在我必须坚持下去。幸运的是，我们很快到达了安检口，顺利通过了检查。

Much like the parts of the city that remain intact I do not understand how this building is here. I saw the roof of it get torn off during Third Impact. The insides of it were blown apart and damaged by whatever the JSSDF did to it. How can it be that it is still standing as if nothing had been done at all? Was this perhaps Shinji's doing when he decided to allow us to return? Was it my doing when I became that being?  
就像城市中那些完好无损的部分一样，我不明白这座建筑是如何存在的。我亲眼看到它在第三次冲击中屋顶被掀飞。内部也被自卫队所做的一切炸毁和破坏。它怎么可能依然屹立不倒，仿佛什么都没发生过？这难道是真嗣允许我们返回时的作为？还是我变成那个存在时的结果？

We step inside the building, armed guards flanking us further adding to my feelings of unease. Misato recognizing this places a calming hand on my back and motions for the guards to adjust their distance to us. As we start to move through the corridors I feel some slight relief to see the interiors are still in some disrepair.  
我们走进建筑内部，武装警卫紧随左右，更加剧了我的不安感。美里察觉到了这一点，轻轻把手放在我的背上，示意警卫调整与我们之间的距离。当我们开始穿过走廊时，看到内部仍有些许破损，我感到一丝宽慰。

Finally we come to one of the elevators, we step inside and I watch as Misato selects one of the lower floors. It was as I suspected, we are going down to those rooms.  
终于，我们来到了一部电梯前，踏入其中，我看着美里选择了其中一个较低的楼层。正如我所料，我们要去那些房间。

"You know where we are going don't you?" She asks me, a look of concern on her face.  
“你知道我们要去哪儿，对吧？”她问我，脸上带着关切的神情。

I nod my head, "Yes."  
我点点头，“是的。”

"Are you scared?" “你害怕吗？”

"Yes." I answer. “是的。”我回答道。

Misato moves close and puts an arm around me pulling me into a hug, "I understand."  
美里靠近了些，伸出一只手臂搂住我，将我拉进一个拥抱，“我理解。”

A few moments later the elevator comes to a stop and the door slides open slowly. I take a deep breath as I follow Misato and the guards out into the corridor. The feelings I have had since I arrived in the city are more intense now, as I take those tentative steps forward I hear a voice in my head, almost mocking me.  
片刻后，电梯停了下来，门缓缓滑开。我深吸一口气，跟着美里和警卫们走出电梯，进入走廊。自从来到这座城市后，我心中的感觉愈发强烈，当我小心翼翼地迈出脚步时，脑海中响起了一个近乎嘲弄的声音。

_'Welcome home' '欢迎回家'_

I try to focus on what might be waiting for me in this building. We seem to be going towards my former quarters but I do not know what could be there that would concern me. In addition I do not know what this thing is that Misato and the others cannot figure out. Any knowledge I had concerning NERV has already been shared with Misato and others, I do not know what possible help I could be.  
我试图集中精神，思考这座建筑里可能有什么在等着我。我们似乎正走向我以前的住处，但我不知道那里会有什么让我担心的事。此外，我也不清楚美里和其他人无法解开的这个谜团是什么。我对 NERV 的所有了解已经与美里等人分享过了，我不知道自己还能提供什么帮助。

We finally reach the door to what was the room made to mirror my home. Misato says something to the man guarding it and shows him her security pass. I show him mine and he lets the two of us into the room. I cross the threshold into the room itself, feeling sick as I do so. I take a quick look around, this place is exactly as I remember it. Every single detail from the look, the temperature and even the smell is as I remember.  
我们终于到达了那扇门前，这里曾是为了模仿我的家而特别布置的房间。美里对守卫说了些什么，并展示了自己的安全通行证。我也出示了我的通行证，他便让我们两人进入了房间。我跨过门槛进入房间，感到一阵恶心。我迅速环顾四周，这个地方和我记忆中一模一样。从外观、温度到气味，每一个细节都如我所记得的那样。

I take a moment to silently wander around. In the back corner I can see the bed, the set of drawers with tablets and a jug of water placed on top, the dirty clothing and screen surrounding it. I feel embarrassed to think that I once lived like that. To think that I allowed myself to live in such conditions and not care. I did what was functional, I showered because I was instructed to, I cleaned clothes because I was instructed to, and I wore clothes because I was instructed to. Those things, they never mattered to me, I was not human. I was something that had been programmed.  
我稍作停留，静静地四处游走。在角落里，我看到了那张床，上面放着一堆药片和一壶水，还有脏衣服和屏风环绕。想到自己曾经那样生活，我感到羞愧。我竟然允许自己生活在那样的环境中，毫不在意。我做的一切都只是为了实用，洗澡是因为被指示要洗，洗衣服是因为被指示要洗，穿衣服也是因为被指示要穿。那些事情，对我来说从未重要过，我不是一个真正的人。我只是一个被编程的工具。

In other parts of the room are worktops and carts with powered down computers and other medical equipment. I ignore them and wander over to the bed. To my surprise I see a number of things laid out on top of the bed, things I recognize but had forgotten about.  
房间的其他地方摆放着工作台和装有已关闭电脑及其他医疗设备的推车。我无视它们，走向那张床。令我惊讶的是，床上摆放着一些我认得但已遗忘的物品。

"Is this what you wanted me to see?" I turn to look at Misato as I ask her the question.  
“这就是你想让我看到的吗？”我转头看向美里，向她提出这个问题。

Misato nods, "Part of it, the other thing is out of this room but… I wanted you to see this first."  
美里点点头，“一部分是，另一部分不在这个房间，但是……我想让你先看看这个。”

My hands are trembling as I look and pick up the first items on the bed. A small stack of A4 drawings that I had done over the years. To the right of them is a pink stuffed bear. I feel tears well up in my eyes as I look at the first drawing in the pile.  
我看着床上的东西，双手颤抖着拿起第一件物品。一小叠 A4 大小的画作，是我这些年来的作品。它们右边是一个粉红色的毛绒熊。看着这堆画中的第一张，我感到泪水涌上了眼眶。

"You did these, right?" Misato asks me as I slowly look through the drawings. I recognize each and every one of them and I feel a smile come to my face as a tear slowly rolls down my cheek. The ones on top are from when I was very young, when I was in my first body. They are very typical drawings that would be done by a human child. Stick figures of me and the commander in a house, a sun drawn in the top with a smiley face. Some of them curiously have a third person, a brother that I had dreamed of and one that I didn't know I had back then.  
“这些都是你画的，对吧？”美里问我，我慢慢地翻看着这些画。我认出了每一张，脸上不由得露出了微笑，泪水缓缓滑过脸颊。最上面的是我小时候，还在第一个身体时的画作。它们非常典型，就像一个人类孩子会画的。我和指挥官的火柴人站在房子里，太阳画在顶部，带着笑脸。其中一些画里还有一个好奇的第三者，一个我曾梦想过的哥哥，那时我还不知道自己真的有一个。

I continue to go through them, and now see the drawings I made when I was in my second body. These are portraits, much more realistic than the childlike drawings of before. The first few are of myself and people I knew in the area. I remember they would sit for me to make these, there is one of Commander Ikari, one of Ritsuko and another of Fuyutsuki. Other pictures are ones I did from memory, they show Misato, Asuka and Shinji. I set the papers down and see Misato looking at me as I wipe away another tear.  
我继续翻阅着，现在看到了我在第二具身体时画的画。这些是肖像画，比之前的孩童画作要写实得多。前几幅是我自己和当地认识的人。我记得他们会坐着让我画这些，有一幅是碇司令的，一幅是律子和另一幅是冬月的。其他的画是我凭记忆画的，展示了美里、明日香和真嗣。我把纸放下，看到美里正看着我，我擦去另一滴泪水。

"You were very good, I had no idea you were so talented."  
“你画得很好，我完全不知道你这么有才华。”

I feel myself blush at her comment, "I never told you or anyone… I… keep it to myself mostly but I do still draw. I… I like to teach the kids art when I work at the school."  
听到她的评论，我感到自己脸红了，“我从没告诉过你或任何人……我……大部分时间都自己保留，但我确实还在画画。我……我喜欢在学校工作时教孩子们艺术。”

"I see." “我明白了。”

"Thank you… for showing me this." I say as I now look towards the stuffed bear. I pick it up and squish it slightly in my hands. This was given to me as a 'present' by the commander. It served me well in my first body but I had no use for it in my second and I suppose I have little use for it now. This bear is a relic and not one I want. I have no place for this anyway, I have stuffed toys, gifts given to me by friends and loved ones.  
"谢谢你……带我来看这个。" 我边说边转向那只毛绒熊。我把它拿起来，在手中轻轻挤压。这是指挥官送给我的'礼物'。它在我第一个身体时很有用，但在第二个身体里我已不需要它，现在想来也没什么用处。这只熊是个遗物，不是我想要的。无论如何，我没有地方放它，我有填充玩具，是朋友和爱人送给我的礼物。

Still… this toy is in good condition and it would be a shame to see such a thing left. Despite it no longer having purpose for me it could still have a purpose for someone else. This could make another child happy.  
尽管如此……这个玩具保存得很好，让它被遗弃真是可惜。虽然它对我已无用处，但对其他人可能仍有用途。这或许能让另一个孩子开心。

"I will keep all of this."  
"我会保留这一切。"

Misato nods again, "Very well. I will see to it that it is all packaged up for us when we return. If you are ready, I will take you to the other thing now."  
美里再次点头，“很好。我们回来时我会确保一切都为我们打包好。如果你准备好了，我现在就带你去看另一个东西。”

I place the toy back down on the bed and follow her back out of the room. I feel her arm around me again as we walk and I try to not let my mind wander as to what might be waiting for me. The feelings I felt before have only gotten more intense, not helped by the wave of emotion I felt at seeing my childhood drawings and stuffed bear.  
我把玩具放回床上，跟着她走出房间。她再次搂住我的手臂，我努力不让思绪飘散，不去想可能等待着我的事情。之前感受到的情感变得更加强烈，看到我童年的画作和填充熊时涌起的情绪更是加剧了这种感觉。

We continue towards another elevator which I know leads further down into Terminal Dogma. We will be travelling past the Dummy Plug facility, where my spares were kept and then destroyed. We will pass through the graveyard containing bodies of failed Evangelions. The knot in my stomach tightens.  
我们继续向另一部电梯走去，我知道它通向更深处的终端教条区。我们将经过模拟插入栓设施，那里存放并销毁了我的备用身体。我们还将穿过一个墓地，里面埋葬着失败的 EVA 机体。我胃里的结越发紧绷。

"When we came back to this place, the first thing people were really interested in seeing was Terminal Dogma." Misato explains as we step into the elevator, "I suppose it makes sense. That was where NERVs darkest secrets were kept. We couldn't get down there immediately but we can now."  
"当我们回到这个地方，人们最感兴趣的首先是 Terminal Dogma。" 我们走进电梯时，美里解释道，"我想这很合理。那里藏着 NERV 最黑暗的秘密。我们当时无法立即下去，但现在可以了。"

"What were you hoping to find down there?"  
"你希望在那里找到什么？"

"Me personally? Nothing, I was hoping we would find nothing down there." She answers, "Unfortunately we did find something but… we don't know what it is. Ritsuko won't have anything to do with this place now and the rest of us don't know. We haven't got the MAGI online so we can't identify it."  
"我个人吗？什么也不希望找到，我希望那里什么也没有。" 她回答，"不幸的是，我们的确找到了一些东西，但……我们不知道那是什么。律子现在不愿与这个地方有任何瓜葛，而我们其他人也不清楚。MAGI 系统还没上线，所以我们无法识别它。"

"Why do you think I can help?"  
“你为什么认为我能帮忙？”

She shakes her head, "Aside from Ritsuko and Fuyutsuki you know more about this place than any of us. You know more about… what this might be than any of us. As I said Ritsuko won't entertain the idea of anything and Fuyutsuki is in Germany, we can't risk transmitting anything to him, if it's intercepted by the media then they can stir something up."  
她摇摇头，“除了律子和冬月，你对这里的了解比我们任何人都多。你比我们任何人都更了解……这可能是什么。正如我所说，律子不会考虑任何可能性，而冬月在德国，我们不能冒险向他传输任何信息，如果被媒体截获，他们可能会煽风点火。”

"I understand." I nod, "Although I am not sure I will be able to help you. I will… do what I can."  
“我明白了。”我点头，“虽然我不确定能否帮上忙。我会……尽力而为。”

As we get lower the feeling of a presence intensifies. It is not what I used to feel from Lilith but something else entirely. I do not understand how I can be feeling such things though, I am human now. Strangely the presence has a warmth to it, it seems to not want me to be afraid. I wonder though if it is just my imagination.  
随着我们逐渐下降，一种存在感愈发强烈。这并非我过去从莉莉丝那里感受到的，而是完全不同的东西。尽管如此，我不明白为何现在身为人类的我能感受到这些。奇怪的是，这种存在感带着温暖，似乎并不想让我感到害怕。不过，我怀疑这或许只是我的想象。

This elevator comes to a stop and we make our way out into the darker corridors of Terminal Dogma. I feel my body shiver, the last time I was here was on the day of Third Impact. I reach out for Misatos hand and grip it firmly as we move forward. We are still flanked by the security personnel and I can feel their unease as well.  
电梯停了下来，我们走出进入终端教条更深处的昏暗走廊。我不禁打了个寒颤，上次来到这里是在第三次冲击那天。我伸手握住美里手，紧紧地随着她前行。我们仍被安保人员包围着，我能感受到他们的不安。

It is not long before we come to the large double doors that once housed Lilith. Could it be that Lilith has somehow returned? No, that cannot be and if it was they would not need me. Still, there is something there, this presence I am sensing, it is behind these doors.  
不久，我们来到了曾经安置莉莉丝的那对巨大双门前。难道莉莉丝以某种方式回来了？不，那不可能，如果是的话，他们也不需要我。尽管如此，那里确实有东西，我感受到的这种存在感，就在这些门后。

The doors slowly open revealing the inside, I audibly gasp at the sight before me. Ahead of me is the walkway up to the giant cross that Lilith was bound to. Lilith is not on the cross but something else is, it seems to be embedded into the structure.  
门缓缓打开，露出了内部景象，我不禁倒吸一口凉气。在我面前的是通往巨大十字架的走道，莉莉丝曾被束缚在那里。但十字架上并非莉莉丝，而是某种嵌入结构的东西。

I step closer to see it is a circular object held in place by a white pillar that surrounds the structure and spreads into the LCL surrounding the platform. As I get closer I can make up more details on the disk, I can see two identical shapes on it, no, not shapes but… creatures, embryonic creatures. There is what seems to be a rounded head, with an eye situated in the middle, the body extends out and spirals around itself. Both creatures are identical and seem to be joined in some way.  
我走近一看，发现那是一个圆形物体，由一根白色柱子固定在结构周围，并延伸至平台周围的 LCL 液体中。随着我越走越近，我能看清圆盘上的更多细节，我看到两个相同的形状，不，不是形状，而是……生物，胚胎生物。它们似乎有一个圆形的头部，中间有一只眼睛，身体向外延伸并螺旋缠绕。两个生物完全相同，似乎以某种方式相连。

"This is it." Misato speaks, "We found it when we first came down here. We tried to get close but it's surrounded by some sort of A.T. Field. We don't know what it is or where it came from."  
“就是它。”美里说道，“我们第一次下来时就发现了。我们试图靠近，但它被某种 A.T.力场包围着。我们不知道它是什么，也不知道它从何而来。”

As I stand before it I feel that presence once again and I look towards the strange object. I feel like the eyes are looking directly at me but I sense no malice from it. Instead I feel something else, a sense of… gratitude. My mouth slowly opens in shock as I come to realize what this is, I understand why this is here.  
当我站在这面前，那种感觉再次袭来，我望向那奇怪的物体。仿佛它的眼睛正直视着我，但我并未感受到恶意。相反，我察觉到的是一种……感激之情。我震惊地慢慢张开嘴，逐渐意识到这是什么，我明白了它为何在此。

I had forgotten over the years but now I remember. These beings were once separate but I brought them together. I felt them within me, I saw what they were, I saw their lives, I saw their purpose and I saw a glimpse of the ones who originally created them. Most of it I can no longer remember but I know what they are.  
多年过去，我已遗忘，但现在我记起来了。这些存在曾各自独立，是我将它们汇聚。我在内心感受到它们，我看到了它们的本质，它们的生活，它们的使命，以及那些最初创造它们者的模糊影像。大部分记忆已模糊不清，但我知晓它们的身份。

I smile, the fear is gone, "I… I understand."  
我微笑着，恐惧已消散，“我……我明白了。”

I now understand what this presence is that I have been feeling. It is from this, it is from this union of the two beings. The former seeds of life that are now as one. They have been trying to express themselves to me all this time. In a way this is beautiful, these two beings that should not have been able to co-exist are now as one.  
我现在明白了这种我一直感受到的存在是什么。它来自这里，来自这两个存在的结合。曾经的生命种子如今合二为一。它们一直在试图向我表达自己。从某种意义上说，这是美丽的，这两个本不应共存的存在如今合为一体。

Misato looks at me with a look of confusion, "Do you know what this is?"  
美里困惑地看着我，"你知道这是什么吗？"

I nod my head, "It is… Adam and Lilith, unified as they were on Third Impact."  
我点点头，"这是……亚当和莉莉丝，正如他们在第三次冲击时那样统一。"

A look of fear spreads across her face, "Adam and Lilith? Are you sure?"  
她的脸上掠过一丝恐惧，“亚当和莉莉丝？你确定吗？”

I nod again, "Yes but… they do not mean us any harm. Instead I believe they wish to… thank us. We have given them what they wanted, we have freed them from their loneliness, they are together… as one."  
我再次点头，“是的，但是……他们并无恶意。相反，我相信他们是想……感谢我们。我们给了他们想要的，我们让他们摆脱了孤独，他们在一起……合二为一。”

She still looks confused, "You know all of this?"  
她依旧一脸困惑，“这些你都知道？”

"On the day of Third Impact I unified the two of them, I saw their loneliness and that they wanted to end it. I do not know how but perhaps they learned through us how to accomplish that, they learned that much like humans they too could co-exist without hurting one another, now they live as one."  
"在第三次冲击那天，我将他们两位合而为一，我看到了他们的孤独，以及他们想要结束这一切的愿望。我不知道他们是如何做到的，但或许是通过我们，他们学会了如何实现这一点，他们学会了像人类一样，彼此共存而不互相伤害，现在他们融为一体生活着。"

"I… I… See, so… what…. What do we do?" She asks me, "I mean… How do we explain this…? What about NERV and the city, I mean… this is… complicated."  
"我……我……你看，所以……我们该怎么办？" 她问我，"我是说……我们怎么解释这一切……？关于 NERV 和这座城市，我是说……这很……复杂。"

"I do not know what you should do." I answer he honestly, "But I believe we should leave them be. I think… leaving the city as it is would be the best thing. Humanity has nothing to fear from them any longer and… we should not give them a reason to fear us."  
"我不知道你们应该怎么做。" 我诚实地回答，"但我认为我们应该让他们自己待着。我想……保持城市的原样会是最好的选择。人类不再需要害怕他们，而且……我们也不应该给他们害怕我们的理由。"

Misato looks at the two beings, "So… we should leave them be? Can we communicate with them at all?"  
美里看着这两个存在，“那么…我们应该让他们自己待着吗？我们能和他们交流吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Very well… I will… Think of something to say in my report." She turns towards the door, "Thank you Rei."  
“很好…我会…在报告中想些话来说。”她转向门口，“谢谢你，绫波。”

### Chapter 16: The Only Unforgivable Thing  
第十六章：唯一不可原谅之事  

**5th October 2021 – Misato Katsuragi  
2021 年 10 月 5 日 – 葛城美里**

"So, this is really it then?" She asks me, "You're actually going to turn around and tell them to walk away? You... are actually going to walk away from it as well?"  
“那么，这真的是最后了吗？”她问我，“你真的要转身告诉他们离开？你……真的也要离开这一切吗？”

I can see the suspicion in her eyes as she speaks, I can hear it in her words and I know exactly what lives behind that suspicion. She needs to know that what I have said to her is the honest truth and after everything she has experiences I can't quite blame her for not believing me.  
我能从她说话时眼中看到怀疑，能从她的言辞中听出疑虑，也清楚那怀疑背后隐藏着什么。她需要知道我对她说的都是真心话，而经历了那么多之后，我无法完全责怪她不相信我。

Ritsuko saw the huge amount of work and effort I put into getting this project going. Ritsuko was the first person I confided in when I told her of my plans and she was also the one who objected to it the most. She never wanted this to happen, she always said that it was best leaving that place untouched and when it came down to it, she was right. I had it when she is right.  
律子看到了我为推动这个项目所付出的巨大努力和心血。当我第一次向她透露我的计划时，她是第一个我倾诉的人，也是最强烈反对的一个。她从未希望这件事发生，她总是说最好让那个地方保持原样，而事实证明，她是对的。我承认她是对的。

I nod my head in confirmation and also go about setting my now empty coffee cup down on the table. As I do so her cat sprinting over to me, it puts its paws up on the table making my attempt to set the cup down somewhat difficult.  
我点头确认，同时将已经空了的咖啡杯放在桌上。就在这时，她的猫飞奔过来，把爪子搭在桌上，使得我放杯子的动作变得有些困难。

"Yes, It's true." I tell her.  
“是的，这是真的。”我告诉她。

I finally set the cup down just as the cat leaps up onto the table. If sniffs at the rim of the cup wondering if perhaps the substance that was within might be suitable for a cat. It then sniffs at my hand for a moment. Its curiosity satisfied it rubs its head firmly against my hand, demanding attention from me. I tickle the animal under its chain as we continue our conversation.  
我终于放下杯子，就在这时，猫跳上了桌子。它嗅了嗅杯沿，想知道里面的东西是否适合猫吃。然后它又嗅了嗅我的手。好奇心得到满足后，它用力地用头蹭我的手，向我讨要关注。我挠了挠它的下巴，我们继续交谈。

"I guess you were right all along Ritsuko, we never should have gone down there." I explain, "There was nothing for us and as you saw, what we did find we were probably better off not finding."  
“我想你一直都是对的，律子，我们根本就不该下去。”我解释道，“那里什么都没有，而且正如你所见，我们找到的东西，可能不知道反而更好。”

To my surprise Ritsuko shakes her head, "I'm not so sure about that."  
令我惊讶的是，律子摇了摇头，“我对此并不那么确定。”

"Oh?"

"I objected to you going there for personal reasons and because I was scared of it. There is nothing in that place anymore for me but memories, bad memories of all the mistakes I made. I feared the ghosts of my past that lived there, that maybe they would come back to haunt me in some way." Ritsuko admits, "But... From a more rational and logical standpoint going back in made sense. Your reasons for doing so made sense, to prevent others from making a mistake with what might be salvaged. Even then it is not just about what could be salvages."  
“我反对你去那里，是出于个人原因，也因为害怕。那个地方对我来说只剩下回忆，全是糟糕的回忆，关于我所犯的所有错误。我害怕那里的过去幽灵，也许它们会以某种方式回来纠缠我。”律子承认道，“但……从更理性、逻辑的角度来看，回去是有意义的。你这样做的原因是有道理的，为了防止别人用可能挽救的东西犯错。即便如此，这不仅仅关乎能挽救什么。”

She pauses to sip her coffee, "There could have been survivors there or something dangerous that we needed to know about. In the end the right course of action was to go back and you certainly should have been the one to do it."  
她停下来喝了一口咖啡，“那里可能有幸存者，或者我们需要了解的危险事物。最终，正确的行动是回去，而你确实应该是去执行的那个人。”

I feel a smile come to my lips, "Thank you and... thank you for actually agreeing to help us. I know and understand you wanted to remain distant from it all."  
我感到唇边浮现微笑，“谢谢你，还有……谢谢你真的同意帮助我们。我知道并理解你本想保持距离。”

"Remaining distant was an impossible task," She sets her cup down, "As long as I do not need to travel to the place then all will be fine. Besides this is... an important find, it would be irresponsible of me to not do what I can. How are the others taking it?"  
“保持距离是不可能的任务，”她放下杯子，“只要我不需要亲自前往那个地方，一切都会没事的。况且这是……一个重要的发现，我若不尽我所能，就显得不负责任了。其他人对此反应如何？”

I shrug, "It's mixed so far, same as it has been throughout the entire project. They didn't really want to believe it at first. They accused Rei of lying or just being wrong."  
我耸耸肩，“目前反应不一，和整个项目一直以来的情况一样。他们起初并不真的相信。他们指责丽说谎或只是搞错了。”

"I meant Rei and Shinji..."  
"我是指丽和真嗣..."

"Oh!" I shake my head, "Rei seems to be okay with it it, a little bit disturbed and I... I haven't told Shinji yet. I will but... I don't really know what to say. I barely know what it is myself. I'm not a scientist I'm just someone who once told people to blow stuff up and then told others where to go and what to pick up."  
"哦！" 我摇摇头，"丽似乎对此没太大问题，只是有点困扰，而我...我还没告诉真嗣。我会说的，但...我真的不知道该说什么。我自己对这东西也几乎一无所知。我不是科学家，我只是曾经告诉人们去炸毁东西，然后告诉其他人去哪里以及该捡起什么。"

"You're downplaying your own abilities there Misato." She smiles, "We're only alive because of some of the things you said. I'm sure you'll be fine at telling Shinji."  
"你这是在贬低自己的能力，美里。" 她微笑着说，"我们能活着，多亏了你的一些指示。我相信你告诉真嗣时也会没问题的。"

"I guess..." I let out a sigh, "It's just he... he has his own concerns with the concert coming up and of course him speaking to Asuka again, I know he'll be nervous about seeing her."  
"我想……" 我叹了口气，"只是他……他对即将到来的音乐会有自己的顾虑，当然还有再次与明日香交谈，我知道他会紧张见到她。"

Mentioning Asuka's name draws a surprised look from Ritsuko, "So she has actually remained in contact with him?"  
提到明日香的名字让律子露出惊讶的表情，"这么说她真的还和他保持联系？"

"She has." I nod my head, "I still... wish I could have done more for her. I feel like it was my fault she left, I never really treated her the same as Shinji and when I took Rei in she got more of the attention. Asuka was..."  
"是的。" 我点点头，"我仍然……希望我能为她做得更多。我觉得她离开是我的错，我从未真正像对待真嗣那样对待她，而当我收养绫波时，她得到了更多的关注。明日香她……"

Ritsuko looks at me and nods, "You made mistakes with Asuka."  
律子看着我，点了点头，“你对明日香犯了一些错误。”

"Yes, I did." I admit, "When she said she was strong and an adult I believed her... No, that isn't true, I didn't believe her, not really. I knew she was hurting, how could she not be but it was easier and more convenient to just let her do her own thing."  
“是的，我确实犯了错。”我承认道，“当她说她很坚强并且是个成年人时，我相信了她……不，那不是真的，我并没有真正相信她。我知道她在痛苦中，她怎么可能不痛苦呢，但那样做更简单也更方便，就让她自己处理自己的事情吧。”

I have had these thoughts many times but I've never really been able to speak them out loud. I don't really know why I'm saying it to Ritsuko now either. She isn't the one who needs to hear this, it's Asuka who does.  
这些念头我曾多次有过，但从未真正大声说出来过。我也不太明白为什么现在要对律子说这些。她并不是需要听这些的人，明日香才是。

"Tell that to her then." Ritsuko speaks up, as if reading my mind, "Same as I did to Maya when I saw her again. Admit your mistakes and move forward."  
"那就告诉她吧。" 赤木律子开口道，仿佛看穿了我的心思，"就像我再次见到真希波时对她说的那样。承认你的错误，然后向前看。"

"I will." I look down, now is not the time for this discussion, we have gotten sidetracked enough. I'm not here to chat about Shinji and Asuka, I'm supposed to be briefing Ritsuko on what we found and her role in this.  
"我会的。" 我低下头，现在不是讨论这个的时候，我们已经偏离主题太远了。我来这里不是为了聊真嗣和明日香的事，我本该向赤木律子汇报我们的发现以及她在这件事中的角色。"

"We should discuss what we found. I know Maya has already told you but I should probably give you a more official version."  
"我们应该讨论一下我们的发现。我知道真希波已经告诉你了，但我或许应该给你一个更正式的版本。"

I reach into my satchel and pull out a handful of papers and set them down on the table, taking care to avoid the cat. I see Ritsukos eyes widen at what she sees.  
我伸手进背包，掏出一把文件放在桌上，小心翼翼地避开那只猫。我看到 Ritsuko 的眼睛因她所见而睁大了。

"We have designated it FAR3, other suggestions were Adlith or Lilam, both of which, as I'm sure you'd agree sound stupid."  
“我们将其命名为 FAR3，其他建议如 Adlith 或 Lilam，想必你也会同意，听起来都很愚蠢。”

She nods, "You have of course confirmed what it is then?"  
她点头道，“那么，你自然已经确认了它的身份？”

"Yes, we were able to bring in equipment to create a proper 3D scan of it. We could separate the two forms and see that one was an exact match for the embryonic form of Adam. We were of course unable to confirm Lilliths embryonic form as we had not encountered that." I pause, "It was Maya who did that."  
“是的，我们设法引进了设备来制作一个精确的 3D 扫描。我们可以将两种形态分离，并发现其中一种是亚当胚胎形态的完全匹配。当然，我们无法确认莉莉丝的胚胎形态，因为我们尚未遇到过。”我停顿了一下，“这是玛雅做的。”

Ritsuko gives a small smile of pride, "Oh?"  
律子露出一丝自豪的微笑，“哦？”

"She modified some of the systems we were using down there, originally we were looking for orange of blue blood patterns thinking. It was based on the UN early warning systems set up outside of NERV."  
“她对我们在那儿使用的某些系统进行了修改，最初我们是在寻找橙色或蓝色的血液模式。这是基于联合国在 NERV 外部设立的早期预警系统。”

Ritsuko gives a nod, "Reasonable."  
律子点了点头，"合理。"

"But... NERV wasn't exactly forthcoming with the UN about other potential patterns. Probably to avoid questions like, 'Why is there a progenitor of life in your basement'? Maya did have knowledge of other patterns so was able to expand the range. Right away it picked up the hybrid as blood pattern red."  
"但...NERV 并没有向联合国透露其他潜在的模式。可能是为了避免类似'为什么你们地下室有一个生命起源'这样的问题。真希波确实知道其他模式，因此能够扩大搜索范围。很快，它就识别出了那个混合体，血型模式为红色。"

"She really is something special that girl." Ritsuko nods, "So. I suppose you'll need me for further tests that won't risk agitating the being."  
"她真的很特别。"律子点头道，"那么，我想你需要我来进行进一步的测试，以避免激怒那个存在。"

I nod, "Something like that, something to ensure but it and our safety as well might be useful."  
我点头，“差不多吧，确保它和我们安全的东西可能会有用。”

She lets out a sigh, "I shall... do what I can. I'm not making any promises though but I think I might be able to modify some of the old Eva tech to produce something. We lost a lot of it but there were other facilities that produced parts which we could use. After this though... I am done and so are you."  
她叹了口气，“我会……尽力而为。虽然不作任何承诺，但我想我可以改造一些旧的 Eva 技术来制造点什么。虽然我们失去了很多，但还有其他生产零件的设施可以用。不过在这之后……我就彻底收手了，你也是。”

"Agreed... After this we both walk away. I just... I want to make sure this is done properly. I don't trust them to make the right decision. Unless I'm there then they'll either try to destroy it or use it. I need someone like you there to examine it, to learn about it and the risks. After that... no more involvement, it's truly over."  
“同意……这件事后我们各自离开。我只是……想确保一切妥善处理。我不信任他们会做出正确决定。除非我在场，否则他们要么试图摧毁它，要么利用它。我需要像你这样的人在场检查，了解它及其风险。之后……不再参与，真的结束了。”

"Good." She nods, "In which case I'll help."  
"好。" 她点头，"既然如此，我会帮忙。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

"And after this, then what happens?"  
"之后呢，会发生什么？"

I shake my head, "I don't really know. I don't want to be involved in this for much longer. I can't take all this bureaucratic crap any longer, it's just meetings about setting up further meetings without getting anything done. I just... I want to leave this behind and... maybe take a break for myself and actually spend some time with Shinji and Rei."  
我摇摇头，"我真的不知道。我不想再卷入这些事情太久。我再也受不了这些官僚主义的废话了，全是关于安排更多会议的会议，却什么都没做成。我只是……我想放下这一切，……也许给自己放个假，真正花些时间和真嗣还有绫波在一起。"

I lower my head, "I just haven't been there enough for them recently."  
我低下头，“我只是最近没能好好陪在他们身边。”

"You've done what you can Misato, all things considered you've done a good job with them."  
“你已经尽力了，美里，考虑到所有情况，你对他们已经做得很好了。”

Once again, the thought of how I failed Asuka flashes through my mind, "I've done nothing, I've just given them a place to live, they've done most of the work. Me? I'm useless, I can't cook, I can't really talk to them, I..."  
又一次，我脑海中闪过自己如何辜负了明日香的念头，“我什么都没做，只是给了他们一个住的地方，大部分事情都是他们自己完成的。我呢？我毫无用处，我不会做饭，也无法真正与他们交流，我……”

Again, I shake my head, "This isn't important right now we should go and I'll introduce you to the team you'll be working with."  
我又摇了摇头，“现在这不重要，我们应该过去，我会把你介绍给团队，你将和他们一起工作。”

We both get up from our seats and move out of the front door of her house and we move towards my car. I feel significantly lighter than when I arrived here today. Having Ritsuko on board for this will make things that little bit easier.  
我们俩都从座位上站起来，走出她家前门，朝我的车走去。我感觉比今天刚来时轻松多了。有了律子加入，事情会变得稍微容易一些。

**9th October 2021 – Shinji Ikari  
2021 年 10 月 9 日 – 碇真嗣**

Today I feel a fear and nervousness that I haven't felt in quite some time. It's different to how I've been feeling for the past five years, it isn't a fear of people recognizing me, no this is a fear similar to how I felt before I would pilot. I feel unease in the pit of my stomach, I'm sweating and I keep pacing back and forth.  
今天我感到一种久违的恐惧和紧张。这与过去五年的感受截然不同，不是害怕被人认出，不，这是一种类似于我驾驶前的感觉。我胃里翻江倒海，浑身冒汗，不停地来回踱步。

I'm not prepared to do this today but I can't back out, I can't run away. I just wish we had more time to figure this out, I wish we had been told more of what would be expected. Instead we were given very little and with it we were able to produce very little. When I spoke to Misato she warned me this is how it was likely to be, she gave me a few questions that she would ask me but said it might not represent what they ask.  
今天我还没准备好面对这一切，但我不能退缩，不能逃避。我只希望我们有更多时间来理清头绪，希望有人能告诉我们更多预期的情况。相反，我们得到的很少，能做的也很少。当我向美里求助时，她警告我这很可能是常态，给了我几个她可能会问的问题，但也说这可能不代表他们真正的问题。

I feel weird for being so scared and nervous, it's not as if my life is at risk or the fate of the world is at stake. If I fail then nothing changes for me. No, it's just the fate of a single person, to help them actually be able to live a proper life. Their future is in my hands, no pressure at all.  
我为自己如此害怕和紧张感到奇怪，毕竟我的生命并未受到威胁，世界的命运也未悬于一线。如果我失败了，对我来说一切都不会改变。不，这只是关乎一个人的命运，帮助他们真正过上正常的生活。他们的未来掌握在我手中，一点压力都没有。

I feel sick. 我感觉不舒服。

I take a deep breath and try to remember that I won't be alone in this. Asuka will be playing her part in this as well, it isn't all on my shoulders. Fuyutsuki is doing what he can too. It isn't just down to me, and yet I feel like it is. I feel like if this doesn't work then I'll be at fault. Ironically, I feel like if we succeed then it'll be because of Asuka.  
我深吸一口气，试图记住在这件事上我不会孤单。明日香也会在这件事中扮演她的角色，并非全压在我肩上。副司令冬月也在尽力而为。并非全靠我，然而我却感觉如此。我觉得如果这事不成，责任将归咎于我。讽刺的是，我觉得如果我们成功了，那将是因为明日香。

I wish I could travel there with Misato and Rei but they will both be meeting me there. Apparently, they wanted us to travel separately for some reason. Both of them have been supportive in this though which did surprise me, especially Misato.  
我希望能和美里与绫波一起前往，但他们都会在那里与我汇合。显然，他们出于某种原因希望我们分开旅行。尽管如此，他们在这件事上都给予了我支持，这确实让我感到惊讶，尤其是美里。

I could tell it was difficult for her when I told her what I was going to do. I know what Kaworu must represent to her. Kaworu was not only the last Angel who betrayed me, the one she took in as her own son but he also represents the beings that killed her father. I feel like a part of her wanted me to have no part of this but she fought it.  
当我告诉她我要做什么时，我能感觉到这对她来说很艰难。我知道渚薰对她意味着什么。渚薰不仅是最后一个背叛我的使徒，那个她视为己出的孩子，他还代表着那些杀害了她父亲的生物。我觉得她的一部分希望我不要参与其中，但她努力克制了这种想法。

I know that must have been difficult for her. The Angels were at times her personal white whale. She sworn revenge on them, she let her own crusade get in the way of her judgement. She put lives at risk for it. She wanted to see them all die because of what they had done to her. It really can't have been easy for her to accept this.  
我知道这对她来说一定很困难。使徒有时是她个人的白鲸。她发誓要向他们复仇，她让自己的十字军行动影响了她的判断。她为此置生命于危险之中。她想看到他们因为对她所做的事而全部死去。她接受这一点真的不容易。

It seemed to be important to Rei as well. She asked if there was anything she could do but it seemed the security council didn't want her getting involved. I'm not sure why, we did ask but it seems they were only willing to hear from myself and Asuka. Rei however reminded me and Misato of what she used to be and how similar her upbringing was to Kaworu's. She mused that given more time perhaps the two could have been allies but it was not to be.  
这对绫波来说似乎也很重要。她问是否有什么她能做的，但安全委员会似乎不想让她参与。我不确定为什么，我们确实问过，但他们似乎只愿意听我和明日香的声音。然而，绫波提醒我和美里她曾经是什么样的人，以及她的成长经历与渚薰有多么相似。她沉思说，如果有更多时间，也许两人本可以成为盟友，但事实并非如此。

I am certain that Kaworu deserves a chance to live freely. We forgave Fuyutsuki and Ritsuko when they returned and they have had the chance to live their lives. He deserves the same. I would not want him to not have those options, regardless of what I did or didn't think of him.  
我坚信，碇真嗣应该有机会自由地生活。当我们原谅了冬月和律子并让他们回归时，他们有了继续生活的机会。他同样值得这样的机会。我不希望他因为我的想法而失去这些选择，无论我对他的看法如何。

I shuffle over to the mirror again in order to adjust my suit jacket sleeves. I'm not sure if maybe the jacket is too big for me but it just doesn't feel comfortable at all. I really dislike wearing it but I was told it'd be better to dress like this rather than how I'd usually dress. This is actually only the second time I've had to wear a suit; the first time wasn't a particularly happy occasion. It was on a day of remembrance held not too long after Third Impact.  
我再次走到镜子前，调整西装外套的袖子。我不确定是不是这件外套对我来说太大了，但它就是感觉很不舒服。我真的很不喜欢穿它，但我被告知这样穿比平时好。这实际上只是我第二次穿西装；第一次并不是一个特别愉快的场合。那是在第三次冲击后不久举行的一个纪念日。

I attended it along with Asuka, Rei and Misato. We had to sit through an uncomfortable speech about the bravery of the pilots who saved the world. We had to listen as names were read out and a statue dedicated to the fallen as unveiled. Afterwards me, Rei and Asuka were given medals in a private meeting with a government official. It was not a comfortable day or moment.  
我和明日香、绫波零以及美里一起参加了那次活动。我们不得不听了一场关于拯救世界的飞行员们勇敢行为的令人不适的演讲。我们听着名字被宣读，一座纪念碑被揭幕。之后，我和绫波零、明日香在一个政府官员的私人会面中被授予了勋章。那一天和那一刻都不舒服。

As I loosen my tie I hear a knock at the door. I immediately freeze up at the realization that this is it. There really is no turning back now, yet I look across at the open window and wonder if... No, I'm on the third floor. I close the window and make my way to the front door and open it. I almost gasp when I see the person standing across from me, our eyes meet for a moment and I have to fight every urge to not slam the door shut.  
我松开领带时，听到敲门声。我立刻僵住了，意识到这就是关键时刻。现在真的没有回头路了，然而我瞥了一眼敞开的窗户，心想是否……不，我在三楼。我关上窗户，走向前门并打开它。看到站在我对面的人时，我几乎要倒吸一口气，我们的目光短暂交汇，我必须竭力克制住想要猛然关上门的冲动。

My eyes wander to the badge attached to his jacket. I see the logo of the security services there and underneath is his name. This is not some anonymous guard come to take me to the meeting today, standing across from me is a man named Hideaki, one of the violin players from our group.  
我的目光落在他夹克上的徽章上。我看到了那里的安保服务标志，下面是他的名字。今天来接我去会面的不是某个无名保安，站在我对面的是一个名叫 Hideaki 的男人，我们乐团的小提琴手之一。

"Shinji." He nods in greeting and gives me an almost embarrassed smile. I say nothing in reply and it seems that he recognized my discomfort, "I should... probably explain a few things, shouldn't I?"  
“真嗣。”他点头致意，给了我一个略显尴尬的微笑。我没有回应，他似乎察觉到了我的不安，“我应该……可能需要解释一些事情，对吧？”

All I can do is nod, I honestly don't know what to say. Hideaki is someone I have spoken to perhaps once or twice in the group. To be honest being around him makes me feel awkward, not so much because of who he is but because of his past. Hideaki lived in Tokyo-3, he had a wife and a son whilst he was there. His son was killed during one of the attacks on the city and shortly after that he started drinking heavily, he, lost his job, split up with his wife and his life had pretty much fallen apart  
我只能点头，老实说我不知道该说什么。Hideaki 在团队里我大概只跟他交谈过一两次。说实话，在他身边让我感到尴尬，不是因为他本人，而是因为他的过去。Hideaki 曾在东京-3 生活，他在那里有妻子和儿子。他的儿子在一次城市袭击中丧生，之后不久他开始酗酒，失去了工作，与妻子分手，生活几乎支离破碎。

Third Impact came and went and Hideaki recovered to see that he has been given a second chance. He was able to reconcile with his wife and they even had a second child, a daughter. Hideaki got a new job and slowly started to rebuild his life. It was all of this that inspired him to learn to play the violin, his goal is to be able to compose a tribute to his son.  
第三次冲击来了又去，Hideaki 恢复过来，发现自己得到了第二次机会。他能够与妻子和解，他们甚至有了第二个孩子，一个女儿。Hideaki 找到了新工作，并慢慢开始重建生活。这一切激励他学习小提琴，他的目标是能够创作一首献给他儿子的曲子。

Naturally I felt awkward around him. I always wondered if he knew who I was and what I was. I always wondered if he blamed me and the other pilots for what happened. I always felt guilty about it, after all we were supposed to defend the people during the Angel attacks and we failed.  
自然而然，我在他身边感到尴尬。我总是想知道他是否知道我是谁，我是什么。我总是想知道他是否责怪我和其他驾驶员所发生的事情。我总是对此感到内疚，毕竟我们本应在天使袭击中保护人民，但我们失败了。

Before Hideaki can say anything else I finally find the ability to speak, "D-Do you know... who I am?"  
"在 Hideaki 能说出其他话之前，我终于找到了开口的能力，“你……你知道……我是谁吗？””

Hideaki nods, "Yes, I've known who you were from the moment you introduced yourself in the first group session."  
"Hideaki 点头，“是的，从你在第一次小组会议上自我介绍的那一刻起，我就知道你是谁了。””

"O-Oh... And you... didn't say anything?"  
"“哦……那你……什么都没说？””

"No." He shakes his head as he speaks, "I figured it would be best to not say anything. I figured you probably didn't want people to know something like that."  
"不。" 他说着摇了摇头，"我觉得最好还是不要说出来。我想你可能不希望别人知道这种事。"

"I... I see..." I nod as I'm frozen to the spot, unable to move. I can feel myself sweating making this suit even more uncomfortable.  
"我... 我明白了..." 我点头回应，身体却僵在原地，动弹不得。我能感觉到自己出汗了，这套西装变得更加不舒服。"

"Actually..." He continues, "I've known you for longer than that. You won't have known but I helped to protect you back in Tokyo-3."  
"实际上..." 他继续说道，"我认识你的时间比你想象的要长。你可能不知道，我在东京-3 时曾帮助保护过你。"

It doesn't take me long to connect the dots, Hideaki must have been a member of Section Two. A member of the elite service that would follow and protect me, Asuka and Rei. I don't quite know what to feel, I have mixed feelings about Section Two. I disliked being followed but understand why it had to happen. At the same time, I have learned since that Section Two didn't always seem to have our safety at heart, their handling of Asuka when she ran away shows this.  
我很快便将线索串联起来，Hideaki 必定曾是第二分部的一员。那个精英部门负责跟踪并保护我、Asuka 和 Rei。对于第二分部，我心情复杂。虽然不喜欢被人跟踪，但理解其必要性。同时，我也了解到第二分部并非始终将我们的安全放在首位，他们对 Asuka 逃跑时的处理方式便证明了这一点。

"I... I had no idea..." I stutter out somewhat politely.  
"我... 我完全不知情..." 我有些礼貌地结巴道。

"No, you weren't supposed to, none of you were supposed to see us or know we were there." He explains, "I had actually hoped that you wouldn't find out..."  
"不，你们本不该知道的，你们都不应该看到我们或知道我们的存在。" 他解释说，"我其实希望你们永远不会发现..."

"Really, why?" I ask him.  
"真的，为什么？" 我问他。

"A number of reasons." He starts to explain, "I know... We all knew how much you hated piloting and I figured after all that happened to you and the others you probably wouldn't want to be reminded of it all. Also... Section Two didn't really shower itself in glory in a few cases. We weren't so much a security service but... Well I probably shouldn't say anything here but there were certain people who prevented us from doing our job properly, I thought... you'd probably hate me if you found out."  
"有几个原因。" 他开始解释，"我知道... 我们都清楚你有多讨厌驾驶，而且我想，经历了那么多事情，你和其他人可能都不想再被提醒这一切。另外... 第二部门在某些情况下并没有展现出多少荣耀。我们与其说是一个安全服务机构，倒不如说... 嗯，这里我可能不该多说，但确实有些人妨碍了我们正常履行职责，我想... 如果你知道了，可能会恨我。"

"H-Hate you?" I stutter again as I feel my hand clench into a fist and unclench, two nervous habits in one. I am surprised at what he has said though, why would he think I'd hate him after what happened to his son. Surely, we failed him?  
"恨你？" 我又一次结巴了，同时感到自己的手紧握成拳又松开，一次紧张的两个习惯。我对他所说的话感到惊讶，为什么他会认为我会恨他，毕竟他的儿子发生了那样的事。我们肯定让他失望了，不是吗？

He nods, "It was stupid I know, you can't really escape your past but I had hoped maybe in this case I could. Turns out fate had a different plan in store."  
他点点头，“我知道这很愚蠢，你无法真正逃离你的过去，但我曾希望也许在这个情况下我可以。结果命运另有安排。”

He half smiles as he finished speaking but I'm still in something of a stunned silence. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I want to say something to him as my mind runs through numerous questions and potential answers. In the end I just go for the usual, "I'm sorry..."  
他说完话时露出一丝苦笑，但我仍处于震惊的沉默中。我能感觉到自己的心跳在胸腔里狂跳。我想对他说些什么，脑海中闪过无数问题和可能的答案。最终，我只是说了句平常的话，“我很抱歉……”

He looks confused, "Sorry... For what?"  
他看起来很困惑，“抱歉……为了什么？”

How can he look confused by my apology? He must know what I'm sorry for, because of what my actions lead to, he lost something previous to him, he nearly lost everything because of my uselessness. I struggle to say anything in reply and I see the confusion fade to realization. He looks away, embarrassed.  
他怎么能对我的道歉感到困惑呢？他一定知道我为什么道歉，因为我的行为导致他失去了原本属于他的东西，差点因为我的一无是处而失去一切。我挣扎着想要回应，看到他脸上的困惑逐渐变为领悟。他尴尬地移开了视线。

"I was a pilot and I... I failed..."I mumble just loudly enough for him to hear.  
"我曾是一名飞行员，而我...我失败了..."我喃喃自语，声音刚好让他能听见。

"Oh..." He looks back at me and kneels down slightly and places a hand on my shoulder, "Shinji... I... Look, you... You have nothing to be sorry for, nothing at all. You did everything that was asked of you, you fought with everything you had and you saved countless lives."  
"哦..."他回头看着我，微微蹲下身子，把手放在我的肩膀上，"真嗣...我...听着，你...你没有什么需要道歉的，一点也没有。你完成了所有要求你做的事，你倾尽全力战斗，拯救了无数生命。"

"B-But..." I shake my head barely daring to say the words, "Your... son..."  
"但...但是..." 我摇着头，几乎不敢说出那几个字，"你的...儿子..."

He pauses and shakes his head, "What happened to my son... was tragic but it was not because of you. My son wasn't killed because of your actions, my son was killed by some two-bit thugs who decided to try to jump the queue when we were evacuating. They got in a fight with the guards and shots were fired, a stray bullet caught him and..."  
他停顿了一下，摇摇头，"我儿子的事...虽然很悲惨，但这不是你的错。我儿子不是因为你的行为而死的，他是被几个想插队的无名小贼害死的。他们在撤离时与守卫发生了冲突，枪声响起，一颗流弹击中了他..."

He pauses again as his hand tightens on my shoulder, his voice sounds quieter, "It was nothing to do with you."  
他再次停顿，手紧紧抓着我的肩膀，声音听起来更轻了，"这与你无关。"

"I... I didn't know..." I lower my eyes again.  
"我... 我不知道..." 我再次垂下眼眸。

"I admit I was... a little bit vague when I told my story to the group but the details of it aren't really something you tell a group of strangers." He says, "The truth is Shinji I... I always wanted to thnk you for what you and the other pilots did. Most of us at Section Two knew that it was wrong, you three being forced to do that. We all knew it was unfair but we also knew there were no other options. We couldn't say it then and... well many of them won't get a chance now so on behalf of them... thank you."  
"我承认，当我向小组讲述我的故事时，我... 有点含糊其辞，但那些细节确实不是对一群陌生人轻易吐露的。" 他说道，"事实是，真嗣，我... 我一直想感谢你和其他飞行员所做的一切。我们第二科的多数人都知道那是错的，你们三人被迫承担这一切。我们都知道这不公平，但也明白别无选择。当时我们无法说出口，而现在... 许多人再也没有机会了，所以代表他们... 谢谢你。"

Once again, I fall silent, I don't quite know what to say to that. I've never been thanked by someone like this before. When it came from that government official we were all thanked but it felt impersonal, like it was some sort of duty they had to perform. I've been thanked by those who came back but that was different as well, I knew those people and they did much as me.  
又一次，我陷入了沉默，不知该如何回应。我从未像这样被感谢过。那位政府官员对我们表示感谢时，感觉很冷漠，就像是一种必须履行的义务。我也曾被归来的那些人感谢过，但那感觉不同，我认识那些人，他们和我一样付出了很多。

With this it is so different, I don't know Hideaki that well and he doesn't really know me. I know that he was a member of Section Two but aside from that he was just a regular member of the public. He was one of the many thousands of civilians who lived in that city. Him saying thank you it... it feels weird, and undeserved. Why am I being thanked? He doesn't know what I nearly did, he doesn't know the truth about who I am.  
这样一来就完全不同了，我对 Hideaki 并不十分了解，他也不真正认识我。我知道他曾是第二科的成员，但除此之外，他只是普通公众的一员。他是那座城市中成千上万平民中的一员。他说的谢谢……感觉很奇怪，也不配得到。我为何要被感谢？他不知道我差点做了什么，他不知道关于我真实身份的真相。

I don't shake my head but I feel my nails dig into the palms of my hands as those thoughts infiltrate my mind. I'm supposed to be fighting those sorts of thoughts, we all are. I'm not a bad person, I shouldn't feel guilty because of what nearly happened. I should accept what did happen but I don't know how. How do you come to terms with the idea that you actually saved the world?  
我没有摇头，但感觉到指甲深深嵌入掌心，这些念头侵入我的脑海。我本应与之抗争，我们所有人都应如此。我不是坏人，我不应该因为差点发生的事情而感到内疚。我应该接受已经发生的事实，但我不知道如何做到。你如何能接受自己真的拯救了世界的想法？

Finally, I speak, my voice no longer caught in my throat. The lump that has formed from hearing his words slowly going. I feel the sting of tears in my eyes but blink them away and I nod.  
最终，我开口了，声音不再卡在喉咙里。听到他的话后形成的硬块慢慢消散。我感到眼中有泪水的刺痛，但眨眼间将其忍住，并点了点头。

"Thank you, for what you did for us as well."  
"谢谢你，也为我们做了那么多。"

He stands up and nods before looking at his watch, "I think we've probably spent enough time here. If possible, I would like to speak to you more but this isn't really the time and place. If that is okay of course?"  
他站起身，点头后看了看手表，“我想我们已经在这里待得够久了。如果可能的话，我希望能和你多聊聊，但这里实在不是合适的时间和地点。当然，如果你觉得可以的话？”

"I... That would be fine." I nod again.  
""我... 那当然可以。"" 我再次点头。

"Good." “好。”

I make my way out of the door and lock it behind me as I do he begins to speak, explaining to me what is happening today.  
我走出门口，顺手将门锁上，这时他开始说话，向我解释今天发生的事情。

"I'll assume you haven't been briefed on the timetable for today?" He asks.  
“我猜你还没被告知今天的日程安排吧？”他问道。

I shake my head, "No."  
我摇摇头，“没有。”

I hear him sigh, "Typical, well as you have probably guessed, I'm your assigned security detail for today. I know it'll be inconvenient for you but I'm so stay close to you at all times, I am to ensure that you are safe in everything you to today. The only time I will not be by your side is when you are in your meeting with the security council."  
我听到他叹了口气，“典型的，好吧，你可能已经猜到了，我是你今天指定的安全人员。我知道这对你来说可能不太方便，但我会一直紧跟着你，确保你今天所做的每一件事都安全无虞。唯一我不在你身边的时候，是你与安全委员会开会的时候。”

I nod, "O-Okay..." 我点点头，“好——好的……”

"Downstairs there is a car waiting for us. It will take us about thirty minutes to reach the UN Embassy. When we are there we will enter via a specially prepared entrance, we don't anticipate any problems regarding the media being there but things have been leaked before."  
“楼下有一辆车在等我们。到达联合国大使馆大约需要三十分钟。到了那里，我们将通过一个特别准备的入口进入，我们预计媒体不会有什么问题，但之前也有过泄密的情况。”

"Oh..." I almost freeze up, I had never considered the idea of things being leaked to the press. Everything I have done has been well away from the press. Everything they know about NERV and the Eva's was specially constructed to ensure myself, Asuka, Rei, Touji and I suppose even Kaworu would not be known about.  
"哦..." 我几乎愣住了，从未考虑过信息会被泄露给媒体。我所做的一切都远离了媒体的关注。他们所知的关于 NERV 和 Eva 的一切都是特意构建的，以确保我、明日香、绫波、东治，甚至可能还有渚，不会被外界所知。

He shoots me a look of concern, "Don't worry about it, as I said we don't anticipate any problems regarding the media. This is purely preventative, there might be some reporters snooping around, pay them no mind, they always hang around for something."  
他投来关切的目光，"别担心，正如我所说，我们预计媒体方面不会有任何问题。这只是预防措施，可能会有一些记者在附近打探，别理他们，他们总是为了某些事情而徘徊。"

"I... See..." I say nervously, "So... If they see me..."  
"我... 明白..." 我紧张地说，"那么... 如果他们看到我..."

"They won't know who you are, unless someone has leaked something in which case we'd know about it before you arrived. They will however be wondering who this young guy is who has strolled into the UN Embassy, so just walk past, don't make eye contact and don't engage them."  
"他们不会知道你是谁，除非有人泄露了信息，那样的话在你到达之前我们就会知道。不过，他们会好奇这个走进联合国大使馆的年轻人是谁，所以只需径直走过，不要对视，也不要与他们交谈。"

"Ok, got it." I nod as we approach the car.  
"好的，明白了。" 我们走近车子时我点头回应。"

"When we arrive, there will be a brief security check for you and then you'll be escorted to meet with Miss Katsuragi and Ayanami. You will all be given a brief tour of the facility if time permits before you meet with the council."  
"我们到达后，会对你进行简短的安全检查，然后你会被护送到与草薙小姐和绫波见面。如果时间允许，在会见委员会之前，你们会得到一次简短的设施参观。"

"Right." “好的。”

He opens the door for me and I get inside, it's one of those larger cars, not quite the size of a limo but spacious. It's black with tinted windows, he climbs in and sits himself down on the seat opposite me. He turns and says something to the driver and we pull away, my heart hammering in my chest. I have to wonder exactly what I've gotten myself into and also hope that I don't mess this up.  
他为我打开车门，我坐了进去，这是一辆较大的车，虽未达到豪华轿车的尺寸，但空间宽敞。车身黑色，车窗着色，他上车后坐在我对面的座位上。他转身对司机说了些什么，我们便驶离了原地，我的心在胸腔中怦怦直跳。我不禁思索自己究竟卷入了什么，同时也希望不要搞砸这一切。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I hear a soft moan of satisfaction as Kaworu snuggles his head into my shoulder, his hair tickling me ever so slightly. In response I bring my arms around his body and run a hand down his back. I let out a satisfied sigh of my own as I try to ignore the little alarm going off in the back of my mind. I look over towards the clock on our bedside table, it's not as bad as I thought, we still have at least half an hour until the car picks us up.  
我听到 Kaworu 满足的轻哼声，他将头埋在我的肩上，头发轻轻拂过我的皮肤。我回应着，双臂环抱住他的身体，手掌顺着他的背滑下。我发出满意的叹息，试图忽略脑海中那微弱的警报声。我瞥向床头柜上的时钟，情况并没有我想象的那么糟糕，我们至少还有半小时才会被车接走。

We should really have been ready an hour ago but as it is here we are in one another arms, both very tired, very sweaty, very naked and extremely satisfied. If I had the choice I'd shut my eyes, fall asleep and just rest here with kaworu but reality is setting in. We have to get out of this bed, we have to put some clothes on and leave.  
我们本该一小时前就准备好的，但现实是我们此刻正相拥在一起，两人都非常疲惫、汗流浃背、一丝不挂且极度满足。如果可以选择，我会闭上眼睛，沉沉睡去，就这样与渚薰静静休息。但现实正逐渐逼近。我们必须起床，穿上衣服然后离开。

Damnit, why did we have to get like this this morning of all mornings? I'm not even usually a morning person, I prefer this sort of thing in the evening. I hate my body sometimes, Kaworu's on the other hand, I quite enjoy that.  
该死，为什么偏偏是今天早上变成这样？我甚至通常不是个早起的人，我更喜欢这种事发生在晚上。有时候我真讨厌自己的身体，但渚薰的身体，我倒是相当喜欢。

I glance down at the melted form in my eyes, it seems cruel to disturb his rest. He looks so peaceful when he sleeps, "Kaworu..."  
我低头看着在我怀中熟睡的他，打扰他的休息似乎有些残忍。他睡觉时看起来如此平静，“渚薰……”

I get a soft movement of his head as he snuggles into me some more, "Mmm... I love you Asuka..."  
他轻轻地动了动头，更紧地依偎在我怀里，“嗯……我爱你，明日香……”

I plant a soft kiss on the top of his head as I blush, I'm still not quite used to hearing or feeling I deserve to hear those words, "I love you too Kaworu but... we... have to get up. Like... Now."  
我在他头顶轻轻一吻，脸颊泛红，我仍不太习惯听到或感觉到自己配得上这些话，“我也爱你，渚薰，但是……我们……得起床了。就是……现在。”

"Why? It's comfortable here..." He protests and snuggles into me once again. I'd be slightly annoyed at his protests if I didn't want the same thing and if he wasn't so adorable and if what we had just done moments ago hadn't have felt so good.  
“为什么？这里很舒服啊……”他抗议道，再次依偎进我怀里。如果不是我也想这样，如果不是他这么可爱，如果不是我们刚刚做的事感觉那么美好，我可能会对他的抗议感到些许恼火。

"Because... A car will be picking up both up very shortly..." I speak calmly, there is no need for any of us to panic. We still have plenty of time to get ready.  
"因为...很快就会有一辆车来接我们俩..." 我平静地说道，我们没必要慌张。我们还有足够的时间准备。

Kaworu unfortunately does not share my desire to remain calm. He suddenly bolts upright, the back of his head almost connecting with my chin as he does so. I get the full brunt of his hair in my face and in one swift movement he throws the covers to the floor exposing us to the cooler air.  
遗憾的是，渚薰并没有和我一样保持冷静的意愿。他突然直挺挺地坐起来，后脑勺差点撞到我的下巴。他的头发猛地扑到我脸上，紧接着他迅速将床单扔到地板上，让我们暴露在较凉的空气中。

"Crap! I... I forgot... I... We...! Oh crap, oh crap! They... They're going to..." Kaworu gets off of the bed and looks around for a moment. He then hurries to his set of drawers.  
"糟糕！我...我忘了...我...我们...！哦糟糕，糟糕透顶！他们...他们要..." 渚薰从床上下来，环顾四周片刻后，急忙走向他的抽屉。

"Kaworu! Calm down." I try to say something to calm my naked and pale boyfriend down as he flails around the room.  
“薰！冷静点。” 我试图安抚我那赤裸着苍白身躯、在房间里乱窜的男友，他正手忙脚乱地四处扑腾。

Unfortunately, my words have no effect on him, I watch as things unfortunately play out as I expect them to. He pulls a pair of boxers out of the drawer and starts to slide them on. I look on as he almost stumbles putting his leg through one of the holes. Normally I'd admire the display of Kaworu putting on his clothes but today his display is more amusing then seductive.  
不幸的是，我的话对他毫无作用，我眼睁睁看着事情如预期般糟糕地发展。他从抽屉里拽出一双内裤，开始往腿上套。我看着他差点因为把腿伸进一个洞里而踉跄。通常我会欣赏薰穿衣服的画面，但今天他的表演与其说是诱人，不如说是滑稽。

With his underwear on he heads to the wardrobe and begins to pull out his suit. I decide now might be a good time to try to calm him down again, "Kaworu... It'll be fine, we still have plenty of time!"  
穿上内裤后，他走向衣柜，开始拿出他的西装。我决定现在或许是再次尝试让他冷静下来的好时机，“薰……没事的，我们还有充足的时间！”

He shakes his head as he throws takes his trousers off of the hanger and puts the rest of the suit onto the bed, "No... No... If we're late then... They'll definitely say no, they..."  
他摇着头，从衣架上取下裤子，将剩下的西装放在床上，“不……不……如果我们迟到了……他们肯定会说不，他们……”

"Kaworu!" I call out his name as he scrambles to try to put his trousers on. Time seems to slow down as I realize exactly what is about to happen. I scramble out of the bed onto the same side as him, myself still completely naked. I put out my arms moments too late as he tries to put one of his legs into the set of trousers, he misjudges it in his haste and stumbles forward. I hear a small yelp from him followed by a loud thud as he hits the ground at my feet.  
“薰！”我喊出他的名字，他正慌乱地试图穿上裤子。时间似乎慢了下来，我意识到即将发生什么。我从床上爬到他那边，自己还一丝不挂。我伸出双臂，但为时已晚，他急忙将一条腿伸进裤子里，却因匆忙而判断失误，向前踉跄。我听到他发出一声轻微的惊叫，紧接着是一声巨响，他跌倒在我脚边。

I glance down at him as he lies there with an embarrassed and dazed look on his face. I kneel down by his side, "Are you hurt?"  
我低头看着他，他躺在那里，脸上带着尴尬而茫然的表情。我跪在他身边，“你受伤了吗？”

He shakes his head, "Only my pride..."  
他摇了摇头，“只有我的骄傲……”

"Idiot." I mutter, "I told you to calm down."  
“白痴。”我低声说，“我告诉过你要冷静。”

"Help?" “帮忙？”

I sigh as I stand back up and extend a hand to help him up, he averts his eyes from me sheepishly as he resumes putting on his clothes, at a much slower pace. At this moment I become more aware of my own nudity and some slight embarrassment creeps in. I'm still not completely used to Kaworu seeing me like this, it's one thing for him to see me or parts of me in the heat of the moment but another to be completely naked around him outside of that.  
我叹了口气，站起身来，伸出手去扶他起来，他羞涩地避开我的目光，继续慢吞吞地穿衣服。此刻，我更加意识到自己的赤裸，一丝尴尬悄然爬上心头。我仍然不完全习惯被渚薰这样看着，激情时刻他看到我或我的一部分是一回事，但在那之外完全赤裸地在他面前又是另一回事。

I move past him towards the drawer, as I do I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I stop for a moment and look at the faint scarring on my chest, my only 'souvenirs' of my time as an Evangelion pilot. I don't even have my hair clips anymore.  
我走过他身边，朝抽屉走去，途中瞥了一眼镜中的自己。我停顿了一下，看着胸前淡淡的疤痕，这是我作为 EVA 驾驶员仅有的‘纪念品’。我甚至连发夹都没有了。

"Asuka, is everything alright?"  
“明日香，一切都好吗？”

I turn to see the look of concern on his face and also realize my hand has now reached up to where my scars are. I nod, "It's fine."  
"我转头看到他脸上的关切表情，同时也意识到自己的手已经不自觉地抚上了伤疤处。我点点头，“没事。””

"Are... Your scars hurting you?"  
“你……你的伤疤在疼吗？”

I shake my head, "No, they don't hurt. They never have done I just... Never really noticed them before."  
我摇摇头，“不，它们不疼。从来都不疼，只是……我以前从未真正注意到它们。”

"Sorry." He mutters as I shoot him a look. He opens his mouth to say something but quickly mumbles another infuriating apology.  
“对不起。”他咕哝着，我瞪了他一眼。他张嘴想说些什么，却很快又含糊地道了个令人恼火的歉。

I take another look at myself before deciding to put some clothes on. The first time Kaworu saw my scars properly he nearly cried, I wasn't quite sure why after all it wasn't his fault they were there. He explained later that the Evangelion Units responsible for that were actually powered by a dummy plug with his data within it. He actually felt responsible, funny that, the two men in my life both feel responsible in some way for my death and scarring.  
我又打量了自己一番，决定穿上衣服。第一次卡哇伊看到我的伤疤时，他几乎要哭了，我不太明白为什么，毕竟这些伤疤不是他的错。后来他解释说，造成这一切的 EVA 机体实际上是由一个含有他数据的模拟插头驱动的。他真的感到有责任，真有意思，我生命中的两个男人都以某种方式觉得对我的死亡和伤痕负有责任。

I on the other hand don't blame them for it. The dummy plug was doing what it was told to do and even if Shinji had been able to help me fight them would it have mattered? Those things didn't seem like they could be beaten.  
而我，并不怪罪他们。那个模拟插头只是在执行命令，即使真嗣能帮我对抗它们，又会有什么不同呢？那些东西看起来根本无法被打败。

Do I hate those scars? Damn right I do, they remind me that I lost. They remind me of the pain I felt and they remind me that I died. They also remind me of how lucky I am to get a second chance. They're a double-edged sword, well perhaps lance would be more appropriate.  
我恨这些伤疤吗？当然恨，它们提醒我我输了。它们让我回想起那种痛苦，还有我死去的事实。但它们也让我意识到自己有多幸运，能得到第二次机会。它们是一把双刃剑，或许用‘长矛’来形容更为贴切。

I glance quickly at Kaworu again as he finishes buttoning up his shirt and start to put my underwear on. It is strange how I am starting to feel more at ease with certain things around him. I never used to imagine myself as being the sort of person who could be comfortable naked or even semi naked around another person. I never even used to be comfortable being naked around myself.  
我快速瞥了一眼正在扣衬衫扣子的渚薰，然后开始穿我的内裤。奇怪的是，我开始在他身边对某些事情感到更自在了。我从未想过自己会成为那种能在别人面前裸体或半裸体感到舒适的人。我甚至从未习惯在自己面前裸体。

Yet there is something about being with Kaworu that just puts me at ease. I'm still not completely comfortable but I'm a hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would be. I suppose that is proof that I am progressing in some way towards what I... want to be? I've actually let Kaworu see me, all of me, my scars and all. I... Well I've certainly seen all of him, he seemed slightly more apprehensive about it than I did. Ironic, considering he told me when he was an Angel he felt no shame about that sort of thing.  
但和渚薰在一起的某些东西让我感到放松。我仍然不完全自在，但我比以前想象的要好得多。我想这证明我在某种程度上向着我想成为的样子前进？我真的让渚薰看到了我，包括我的伤疤。我...嗯，我也确实看到了他的一切，他似乎比我更紧张。讽刺的是，考虑到他曾告诉我作为天使时对这种事毫无羞耻感。

I continue to get ready, both of us getting our suits on fairly quickly. I brush my hair, spray on some perfume and add a small amount of makeup, nothing much but just enough to hide any evidence of our prior activities.  
我继续准备着，我们俩都很快穿上了西装。我梳理头发，喷了点香水，再稍微化点妆，不多，只是刚好能掩盖我们之前的活动痕迹。

It doesn't take us long to get ready, truthfully, I've never been someone who took too long to get ready. Well, that isn't strictly true. When I was younger, when I was 'her', I would have taken a lot longer to get ready. I had to have the perfect look, the right dress, the right makeup and the right perfume for the time. I had to ensure it was all fine to get the spotlight on me, and me alone. Now... Well it's not that I don't care about how I look, I do care but I just don't want the spotlight to be on me. I don't want people to notice me, it's the last thing I'd want.  
我们没花多少时间就准备好了，说实话，我从来不是那种需要很长时间准备的人。嗯，这么说也不完全准确。当我年轻时，当我是‘她’的时候，我会花更长时间准备。我必须要有完美的外表，合适的裙子，恰到好处的妆容和香水。我得确保一切都无可挑剔，以便成为众人瞩目的焦点，只属于我一个人。现在...并不是说我不在乎自己的外表，我确实在乎，只是我不希望成为焦点。我不希望被人注意到，这是我最不想要的。

I look back in the mirror and as if by magic my good feelings from earlier fade away and the doubt and nervousness creeps in. I fire a glance at Kaworu, I can see that he is nervous as well, sat on the edge of the bed in his suit and glancing down at the ground. He looks pale, well paler than usual.  
我回头看向镜子，仿佛魔法般，之前的好心情消失了，怀疑和紧张感悄然袭来。我瞥了一眼渚薰，我能看出他也很紧张，坐在床边，穿着西装，低头看着地面。他看起来很苍白，嗯，比平时更苍白。

I look back at myself and start to ask myself questions in my mind. What if I'm not able to do this for Kaworu? What if I do end up failing him? What happens next? I've been talking to Shinji about this and others, we've decided that this isn't just about getting Kaworu to be able to go to Japan for a concert. This is about allowing him to live as a free person, to not be restricted or watched like some sort of villain.  
我回头审视自己，心中开始自问。如果我无法为渚做到这一点怎么办？如果我真的让他失望了怎么办？接下来会发生什么？我和真嗣讨论过这个问题和其他事情，我们决定这不仅仅是为了让渚能去日本参加音乐会。这是为了让他在自由的环境中生活，不被限制或像罪犯一样被监视。

If I fuck this up then... he's restricted, he's scrutinized and he loses that power. So, the question is, if I do fuck this up then will I also lose him? Will Kaworu hate me for fucking this up?  
如果我搞砸了……他就会被限制，被严密审查，失去那份力量。所以问题是，如果我真的搞砸了，我也会失去他吗？渚会因为我搞砸了而恨我吗？

I try to fight these fears away but another voice is there warning me that I've done it again. I've talked big without realizing that I'm powerless to back it up. It's no different to how I used to be, arrogance and overconfidence and no ability. I'm preparing to fail and I haven't even gotten there yet. Let's be honest though, I'm no strange to failure, I've been doing it for most of my life.  
我试图驱散这些恐惧，但另一个声音警告我，我又一次夸夸其谈，却没有意识到自己无力支撑。这与我过去的样子没有什么不同，傲慢、过度自信且无能。我正准备失败，甚至还没开始。不过说实话，我对失败并不陌生，我一生中的大部分时间都在经历失败。

This time though... It's different because I'm not alone in this fight and for once in my life I'm actually accepting it, I'm actually happy about it or at least I'm actually willing to admit I'm happy about it. Truth is, as much as I said that I hated being team mates with Shinji and Rei back then, when the three of use worked together it was some of the happiest moments of my miserable life. I just couldn't admit it. Well I can now, I need help and as much as it dents my pride to admit it I need to rely on others.  
然而这一次...情况不同了，因为我不再独自面对这场战斗，而且这是我一生中第一次真正接受这一点，我确实对此感到高兴，或者至少我愿意承认我对此感到高兴。事实上，尽管我曾说过我讨厌与真嗣和绫波一起成为队友，但当我们三人并肩作战时，那是我悲惨生活中最快乐的时刻。我只是无法承认。但现在我可以了，我需要帮助，尽管承认这一点让我自尊受损，但我需要依靠他人。

This all makes me feel slightly better, I know that together... we can do this. We might not be seperated by half the world but we can do it. Me and him, like we used to be able to. When we worked together... nothing could stop us. The invincible Shinji... I used to call him that with such disdain but today I'm calling him it because I believe it.  
这一切让我感觉好了一点，我知道，只要我们在一起...我们就能做到。我们或许没有被半个世界分隔，但我们能做到。我和他，就像我们曾经能够做到的那样。当我们并肩作战时...没有什么能阻挡我们。无敌的真嗣...我曾带着轻蔑这样称呼他，但今天我这样称呼他是因为我相信这一点。

Please Shinji... Come through for us...  
请真嗣...为我们挺过来...

"Everything is... going to be alright... isn't it?"  
“一切都会...好起来的...对吧？”

I hear Kaworu softly speak and I turn to look at him again. He's still sat at the edge of the bed, his hands trembling with nerves. I try to hide away any doubt and fear I'm feeling. If I show that then it helps no one. I realize that I have to put up that front for just a little while today, I have to try and become... 'her' once again.  
我听到卡哇伊轻声说话，再次转头看向他。他依旧坐在床边，双手因紧张而颤抖。我试图隐藏自己的任何疑虑和恐惧。如果我表现出这些，那对任何人都没有帮助。我意识到今天我必须再坚持一会儿，我必须努力再次成为...‘她’。

As I make my way towards him I wonder, just who is she? I cast my mind back to that fourteen-year-old version of myself, that girl I used to be and the one I'm so very afraid of. I think of her like some sort of ghost that haunts me. I think of her as if she is a spectre that I've tried to exorcise but she never truly goes away.  
当我走向他时，我不禁思考，她究竟是谁？我回想起十四岁时的自己，那个曾经的女孩，那个我如此害怕的她。我像对待一个幽灵一样想起她。我像对待一个我试图驱除却从未真正离开的鬼魂一样想起她。

I'm not the only one with these ghosts though, Kaworu... Shinji... Rei... we all have them. All of them take the form of these versions of us from many years ago but we warp and distort them. They are made up not of who we are but who we think they were, created by our fears.  
我并非唯一被这些幽灵缠绕的人，Kaworu... Shinji... Rei... 我们都有。它们都以多年前我们这些版本的形态出现，但我们扭曲和变形了它们。它们不是由我们是谁构成的，而是由我们认为他们是谁构成的，由我们的恐惧创造。

They aren't bad though, they aren't evil and we shouldn't be afraid to accept them. I... I sort of understand this now. I understand that the person I think of myself as being isn't the full story and that not everything about me back then was bad. Still... I have that worry, if I allow even a little bit of that girl to slip back in... will I not regress and lose who I am now?  
然而，它们并不坏，它们不是邪恶的，我们不应该害怕接受它们。我...我现在有点明白了。我明白我自认为的那个人并不是全部的故事，而且那时候的我并非一切都糟糕。尽管如此...我仍有担忧，如果我允许那女孩的一丝一毫重新渗入...我会不会倒退，失去现在的自己？

No. I won't do that. I can't do that, I'm not scared of who I am. Not anymore.  
不。我不会那样做。我不能那样做，我不再害怕自己是谁。不再害怕了。

So with that I kneel down in front of Kaworu and grin, "Of course it will!"  
于是我跪在渚薰面前，咧嘴一笑，“当然会成功！”

"Are you... sure?" He asks me.  
“你……确定吗？”他问我。

I look into his eyes and nod, "Are you kidding? With me and the invincible Shinji in your corner, how can it go wrong?"  
我凝视着他的眼睛，点头道，“开玩笑吧？有我和无敌的真嗣在你这边，怎么可能会失败？”

Good, confident with just the right amount of arrogance. I can do this, I can channel her. My words also seem to have had an effect on Kaworu. He smiles back at me, "Are you... nervous?"  
"好，自信中带着恰到好处的傲气。我能做到，我能模仿她。我的话似乎也对渚薰产生了影响。他回以微笑，问道：“你……紧张吗？””

I nod at him and take his hand, placing it on my chest and holding it over my rapidly beating heart, "Yes, but... that's fine. I was nervous every time I would go out and kick an Angel's ass."  
"我朝他点点头，拉过他的手放在我的胸口，让他感受我急速跳动的心脏，“是的，但……没关系。每次出去痛击使徒时，我都会紧张。””

He smiles as he holds his warm hand in place for a moment, "I watched your old footage you know... You were really talented."  
"他微笑着，将温暖的手掌停留片刻，“我看过你以前的录像，你知道的……你真的很出色。””

"Of course I was! I trained for nearly ten years to get that good." I shoot back, "It's going to be fine Kaworu, we'll make them see sense."  
"当然我是！我训练了近十年才达到那个水平。" 我回击道，"一切都会好的，卡乌尔，我们会让他们明白道理的。"

"Shinji..." Kaworu removes his hand, "He is really going to help us?"  
"真嗣..." 卡乌尔移开手，"他真的会帮我们吗？"

I give him another nod, "Yup, and I didn't even have to threaten him."  
我再次点头，"是的，我甚至都没威胁他。"

"Y-You wouldn't have done?" He asks me with some horror on his face.  
"你——你不会真的那么做了吧？" 他带着些许惊恐的表情问我。

"No! Of course, I wouldn't You idiot!" I reply instantly, "It's like I told you, he did take some persuading initially. He wasn't sure he could really help us."  
"当然没有！你这个笨蛋！" 我立刻回答，"就像我之前告诉你的，他一开始确实需要一些说服。他不太确定自己真的能帮到我们。"

"I know." Kaworu looks down, "I just... Worry that he hates me and might not do this."  
"我知道。" 渚薰低头说道，"我只是……担心他讨厌我，可能不会这么做。"

I squeeze Kaworu's hand as I speak, "Shinji doesn't hate you. In fact I... I don't think Shinji is really capable of hating anyone. When I was at my worst towards him he didn't hate me, I yelled and screamed at him, I... I never hit him but I threw things and damaged stuff and he never hated me."  
我紧握着渚薰的手说道，“真嗣并不恨你。事实上，我……我认为真嗣其实不太能恨任何人。即使我对他最恶劣的时候，他也没有恨我，我对他大喊大叫，我……我从未打过他，但我扔东西、破坏物品，而他从未恨过我。”

I pause for a moment, "I... I don't even think he hates his own father. It's... kinda annoying in a way, I think some people deserve to be hated. Some people you... can't forgive."  
我顿了一下，“我……我甚至不认为他恨自己的父亲。这……在某种程度上有点烦人，我觉得有些人是应该被恨的。有些人你……无法原谅。”

Kaworu nods, he understands what I'm talking about, he has confessed to me his conflicting thoughts on SEELE and his upbringing.  
渚薰点头，他明白我在说什么，他已经向我坦白了他对 SEELE 和成长经历的矛盾想法。

"Shinji... doesn't know how to feel regarding you but he definitely doesn't hate you and he wants to help you. I think with him helping we can do this. In fact, I know we can, there is no better team than me and Shinji."  
“真嗣...对你感觉如何他并不清楚，但他绝对不讨厌你，而且他想帮助你。我认为有他的帮助，我们能做到。事实上，我知道我们能做到，没有人比我俩和真嗣组成的团队更出色了。”

I grin once more as I say those words. It's funny to think of myself saying such a thing whilst I'm trying to channel some of the confidence of that younger Asuka. She'd hate me for admitting I need help from anyone but I know there is no shame in it.  
我再次咧嘴一笑，说出这些话。想到自己试图模仿年轻时的明日香那种自信，真是好笑。她会讨厌我承认需要任何人的帮助，但我知道这并不丢脸。

Still I do feel a slight dent to my pride as I say it. Those ideals were chiseled into me over and over again for almost ten years. I told myself repeatedly I had to do everything alone, that I didn't need anyone else and it was weak to rely on others. It's hard to undo ten years' worth of damage and trauma in half the time it took to put it in place.  
尽管如此，说出这话时我还是感到一丝自尊受损。这些观念在我心中反复雕琢了近十年。我一再告诉自己必须独自完成一切，不需要任何人，依赖他人是软弱的表现。要在半时间内消除十年累积的伤害和创伤，实在不易。

Being friends with Rei, being in touch with Shinji again and falling for Kaworu... Well I feel like that has helped speed it up. Maybe it is fine to need other people.  
与丽成为朋友，再次与真嗣保持联系，以及对渚的感情...我觉得这些都加速了这一过程。或许，需要他人并不是坏事。

"I really love you Asuka." Kaworu suddenly speaks, "Thank you... For everything."  
“我真的非常爱你，明日香。”渚突然说道，“谢谢你...为一切。”

My hand squeezes his once again as I lean in and kiss him softly on the lips, I get to my feet, "I love you too Kaworu. Now... Shall we get this over and done with?"  
我再次握紧他的手，倾身轻轻吻上他的唇，然后站起身来，“我也爱你，渚。现在...我们是不是该把这件事解决了？”

### Chapter 17: Lifting Shadows  
第十七章：揭开阴影  

**Tokyo 2 - UN Embassy – Waiting Room - Shinji Ikari  
东京 2 区 - 联合国大使馆 - 等候室 - 碇真嗣**

I'm sat nervously in a small room waiting to be let into the meeting room with the council. My meeting should have started ten minutes ago but I've been told the group are running late. Misato did warn me that that would be likely, she said that in her experience these sorts of meetings never start on time.  
我紧张地坐在一间小房间里，等待被允许进入与委员会的会议室。我的会议本应在十分钟前开始，但我被告知那群人迟到了。美里确实警告过我这很可能会发生，她说根据她的经验，这类会议从来不会准时开始。

So, for the moment I am sat, alone in this small room. I'm on a fairly uncomfortable seat and across from me is an old television playing a repeat of an old gameshow. I'm not sure how old it is but it's in English and seems to be themed around darts of all things. It has subtitles and I've just watched the contestants win a speedboat.  
此刻，我独自坐在一间狭小的房间里。身下是一张颇为不舒服的椅子，对面是一台老旧的电视机，正播放着一档老游戏节目的重播。我不确定这节目有多久远，但它是英文的，主题竟然是飞镖。节目有字幕，我刚看到参赛者赢得了一艘快艇。

Would they even want a speedboat? What if they don't live near any water? How do they split a speedboat between them?  
他们真的会想要一艘快艇吗？如果他们不住在靠近水域的地方怎么办？他们怎么分这艘快艇呢？

I'm not quite sure that frightens me more, the idea of this meeting or the badly drawn cartoon bull that has appeared frequently throughout the show.  
我不太确定哪个更让我害怕，是这次会面的想法，还是节目中频繁出现的画风糟糕的卡通公牛。

I continue watching this bizarre terribly-yet-good show for a few moment minutes and finally the door to the meeting room opens up. A small woman steps through and smiles at me.  
我继续观看这部古怪却又不失精彩的糟糕节目，过了几分钟，会议室的门终于打开了。一位娇小的女士走了进来，对我微笑。

"Terribly sorry to keep you waiting, we had some issues with the tech. The council are ready to meet with you now."  
非常抱歉让您久等了，我们的技术出了些问题。议会现在准备好与您会面了。

I immediately rise to my feet and try to disguise the trembling in my body. I can't let them see any fear from me. I need to step through there and be confident in what I say and do. I can't afford to make any mistakes in front of these people.  
我立刻站起身来，试图掩饰身体的颤抖。我不能让他们看到我有一丝恐惧。我必须走进去，自信地表达和行动。在这些人面前，我不能犯任何错误。

"Okay." I nod at her and follow her through into the room, leaving the world of cartoon bulls and darts behind.  
“好的。”我向她点头，跟着她穿过门进入房间，将卡通公牛和飞镖的世界抛在身后。

The meeting room is what I expected it to be, it is a wide and open room with a large circular table planted in the middle. The air in the room is cool, and I hear the low hum of an air conditioner. I see one seat set up in the room, in front of it is a bottle of water and a see through plastic cup. I presume that this is going to be my seat. The room is somewhat brighter than I expected, I see a few decorative plants in the corners, some bookshelves and the flags of the member countries on the walls.  
会议室正如我所料，宽敞开阔，中央摆放着一张巨大的圆形桌子。房间里空气凉爽，我听到空调低沉的嗡嗡声。我看到房间里设有一个座位，前面放着一瓶水和一只透明的塑料杯。我猜这就是我的座位。房间比我想象的要明亮些，角落里有几盆装饰植物，书架和成员国的国旗挂在墙上。

I admit, I am slightly confused by the lack of seating in the room. Aside from my chair there are no others around the table, instead there are nine metallic blocks where the seats would be. I turn to the woman who brought me in, "W-Where is everyone else?"  
我承认，我对房间里缺少座位感到有些困惑。除了我的椅子外，桌子周围没有其他椅子，取而代之的是九个金属块。我转向带我进来的那位女士，“其他人呢？”

She lets out a small laugh, "Oh, of course! I should have explained. The council are not going to be here physically, there are currently in Berlin and this meeting will be done remotely, the council will be represented holographically."  
她轻笑一声，“哦，当然！我应该解释一下。议会成员不会亲自到场，他们目前正在柏林，这次会议将以远程方式进行，议会将通过全息影像代表出席。”

"Oh... I see..." I nod again as I take a few tentative steps forward towards the large seat waiting for me, it's one of those semi comfortable executive looking chairs. I sit myself down in it awkwardly and take a moment to adjust. I ask myself if the seat is comfortable enough. Should I adjust it? Can I adjust it? How should I be sitting in the seat? Should I have my arms on the armrests or on the tables?  
“哦……我明白了……”我再次点头，小心翼翼地向前走了几步，来到那把为我准备的大椅子前，这是一把半舒适的行政椅。我笨拙地坐下，调整了一下姿势。我自问这椅子是否足够舒适。我应该调整它吗？我能调整它吗？我应该怎么坐？手臂是放在扶手上还是桌子上？

In the end I settle for not adjusting the seat and just sitting with my arms neatly folded in front of me. The woman leaves the room and I take a few steady breaths and look around the now empty room. I realize, likely much too late, that I am... not prepared for this. I really don't know if I can do this. I wish I had someone here with me. I wish Misato or Rei were here. I wish Asuka was here. I can't do this... I can't face this on my own!  
最终，我决定不调整椅子，只是端正地坐着，双臂整齐地交叉在身前。那位女士离开了房间，我深呼吸几次，环顾这个空荡荡的房间。我意识到，可能已经太晚了，我……没有准备好面对这一切。我真的不知道我能不能做到。我希望美里或绫波丽在这里。我希望明日香在这里。我不能独自面对这一切！

Unfortunately, I have little choice now, before I can even get lost in my own sudden loss of confidence I hear a whirring noise and one by one each of the devices around the table suddenly come to life. I see nine people appear in front of me. They are a mixture of men and women, of varying ethnicity. One of them, an older Japanese man situated to my right looks familiar but I can't place his face.  
遗憾的是，我现在别无选择，在我还来不及沉浸在自己突如其来的信心丧失中时，我听到了一阵嗡嗡声，桌子周围的设备一个接一个地突然启动了。我看到九个人出现在我面前。他们男女混杂，种族各异。其中一位坐在我右边的老日本男人看起来很眼熟，但我认不出他的脸。

At the head of the table, across from me is a rather stocky looking bald man with a bushy ginger moustache. He looks directly at me and starts to speak, he has a German accent but is speaking Japanese, "Sorry to have kept you waiting Herr Ikari, sometimes the technology we use for these conferences does not always perform to the standards that we would like it to. Sometimes I long for the days of face to face meetings, they seemed easier but technology does move in but I am digressing. I hope you are well?"  
坐在桌子对面，正对着我的是一个看起来相当健壮的光头男子，留着浓密的姜黄色胡子。他直视着我，开始说话，带着德国口音，但说的是日语，“很抱歉让您久等了，碇先生，有时候我们用于这些会议的技术并不总能达到我们期望的标准。有时候我怀念面对面的会议，它们似乎更简单，但技术确实在进步，我有点跑题了。希望您一切安好？”

I give a nod and I'm not quite sure what to say in reply to him. Do I smile and say something about the technology as well? Do I just say I am fine? Already I am thrown, this man is different to what I had expected, especially for someone in a position of such power. He seems jolly and so unlike the stuffier politicians I've seen on television or even the ones I have encountered.  
我点了点头，不太确定该如何回应他。我是该微笑着谈论一下技术呢，还是简单地说我很好？我已经感到有些措手不及，这个人与我预想的截然不同，尤其是处于如此高位的人。他显得很愉快，与我见过的那些电视上或现实中更为严肃的政客大相径庭。

I take a quick moment to look at the others on the council. A few of those look much more like I had expected them too, in particular the Japanese guy to my right who is, unless I am imagining things, scowling at me.  
我迅速扫视了一下委员会的其他成员。其中几位看起来更符合我的预期，特别是我右边的那位日本男士，除非我看错了，他似乎正对我皱眉。

"I... I am fine, thank you." I finally reply.  
“我……我很好，谢谢。”我终于回答道。

"Very good." He announces, his booming voice echoes around the room.  
“非常好。”他宣布道，洪亮的声音在房间里回荡。

As I see and hear this man I feel slightly more at ease, unfortunately the others don't give me that same feeling. I feel like half of them are scowling at me and looking at me with hate in their eyes, I feel like the other half are looking at me with admiration. It had dawned on me as I was preparing for this that the people I meet will all know who I am, this is the on situation where people where I can be sure of that.  
当我看到并听到这个人时，我感到稍微放松了一些，不幸的是，其他人并没有给我同样的感觉。我感觉一半的人在对我怒目而视，眼中充满了仇恨，而另一半则用仰慕的目光看着我。在我为这次会面做准备时，我意识到我遇到的人都会知道我是谁，这是唯一一个我能确信人们认识我的场合。

I am trying to keep clam about that fact, just because these people know who I am doesn't mean anything bad can happen. Nothing bad can happen, these people aren't even here physically so they can't hurt me. I am safe and secure here and they have a job to do. What they think of me personally doesn't matter.  
我试图保持冷静，仅仅因为这些人知道我是谁，并不意味着会发生什么坏事。不会发生任何坏事，这些人甚至不是以实体形式存在，所以他们无法伤害我。我在这里既安全又受保护，他们有他们的工作要做。他们对我的个人看法并不重要。

"We are here to discuss the matter of Mr Kaworu Nagisa." He speaks again, "it is the belief of this committee that both yourself and former pilot Asuka Langley Soryu would like to appeal against our decision to restrict Mr Nagisa's activities. This meeting will therefore be used to help establish whether or not we should reverse that decision, is this understood by everyone?"  
“我们聚集于此，是为了讨论关于碇真嗣先生的事宜。”他再次开口，“本委员会认为，您与前驾驶员惣流·明日香·兰格雷小姐有意对限制碇真嗣先生活动的决定提出申诉。因此，本次会议将用于探讨是否应撤销该决定，各位是否都已理解？”

I nod my head and look around again to see the others nod their heads and give murmurs of agreement. After this the members of the council introduce themselves to me, when it comes to the Japanese man who has been scowling at me he introduces himself as Shiro Tokita, again I can't help but feel like I have heard the name before but I cannot think where.  
我点头回应，环顾四周，见其他人也纷纷点头并发出附和的低语。随后，委员会成员向我自我介绍，轮到那位一直对我怒目而视的日本男子时，他自称是土田城，我总觉得这个名字似曾相识，却想不起在哪里听过。

I get little time to dwell on it though. Once again, the man in charge speaks in his loud booming voice, "Well now that we have the introductions out of the way we can begin."  
然而，我无暇深思。主持会议的男子再次用他那洪亮的声音说道：“既然我们已经完成了自我介绍，那么现在可以正式开始了。”

**Berlin - UN Embassy – Waiting Room – Asuka Langley Soryu  
柏林 - 联合国大使馆 - 等候室 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I've barely been here five minutes and I'm already in a bad mood. On arriving here, I wasn't even given a chance to say goodbye to Kaworu properly, the security grabbed me and whisked me away from him and led me straight to this waiting room. It turns out Kaworu won't be a part of these meetings today, he isn't even allowed in the building.  
我刚到这里不到五分钟，心情就已经很糟糕了。一到这儿，我连好好跟渚薰道别的机会都没有，安保人员就抓住我，把他从我身边拉开，直接带到了这个等候室。原来渚薰今天不会参加这些会议，他甚至不被允许进入这栋大楼。

Did they do this on purpose? Put me in a bad mood before the meeting starts so they can try to throw me off? Well it isn't going to work, if anything I'm just more determined now.  
他们是故意的吗？在会议开始前让我心情不好，试图扰乱我？哼，这招不会奏效的，反而让我更加坚定了。

Although, as much as I hate to admit it, I am very nervous about this. Waiting for me in that next room are nine highly trained politicians. They are each going to look to tear me apart. It's nine against one, odds I've encountered before and... to be perfectly frank, things didn't go so well for me last time.  
虽然我极不情愿承认，但我确实对此感到非常紧张。在那间屋子里，有九位训练有素的政客正等着我。他们每个人都想把我撕成碎片。这是九对一的局面，我以前也遇到过类似的...坦白说，上次的情况对我并不利。

I am determined to do this though. I have to believe that I can do this. This isn't for me, this is for Kaworu who right now will be either aimlessly wandering through a part of town he's never been in or sat outside this building.  
但我决心要完成这件事。我必须相信自己能做到。这不仅仅是为了我自己，而是为了此时此刻可能正在某个陌生街区漫无目的地徘徊，或是坐在这栋建筑外的薰。

So, I will get this done, I'll go in there and speak to them all. I'll persuade them to overturn their decision and then we will get Kaworu what he needs to go back to Japan. We'll get ourselves to the concert and we'll see them again and have a good time.  
所以，我会完成这件事，我会走进去与他们交谈。我会说服他们改变决定，然后我们就能为薰拿到回日本的所需。我们会去参加音乐会，再次见到他们，并度过一段愉快的时光。

With that thought comes another issue, one I have been thinking about more and more recently and one I don't really want to think about. When we go to Japan that will be the moment that Shinji and Kaworu reunite. I'm not an idiot, I know exactly how Kaworu feels about Shinji and I know how Shinji feels in regards to Kaworu. Despite their problems now they will feel those same feelings once again when they meet, it's inevitable.  
这个念头一出现，另一个问题也随之而来，这是我最近越来越频繁思考的问题，也是我并不真正想面对的问题。当我们去日本时，那将是真嗣和薰重逢的时刻。我不是傻瓜，我清楚薰对真嗣的感情，也知道真嗣对薰的感觉。尽管他们现在有种种问题，但一旦见面，那些相同的感情必将再次涌现，这是不可避免的。

So, what will happen to me after that? I guess... It'll be just like those dreams I had. Not the rarenice ones where the three of us are somehow together but the other ones. The ones where they both walk away and I'm left all alone. I don't want to be abandoned, I don't want to be alone, I want what I have now. I don't want to lose Kaworu.  
那么，在那之后我会怎样呢？我想……那会像我做的那些梦一样。不是那种稀有的美好梦境，我们三人不知怎么地在一起，而是其他的梦。那些他们两人都离开，留下我孤单一人的梦。我不想被抛弃，我不想孤单一人，我想要现在拥有的一切。我不想失去薰。

I try to take a moment to calm down, I'm getting ahead of myself and being stupid. For a brief second one of the nicer images from my dreams flashes into my mind. I had a dream once we all lived together, I don't know what we were... but we were all happy and just enjoyed being around one another. It is just a dream though.  
我试图冷静下来，我有点杞人忧天，太愚蠢了。有那么一瞬间，我梦中的一个美好画面闪现在脑海里。我曾梦到我们三人住在一起，虽然我不知道我们是什么关系……但我们都很快乐，只是享受彼此的陪伴。不过，那毕竟只是个梦。

That is another worry of mine, telling Shinji about what me and Kaworu are. It'll hurt him and... I really don't want to hurt him. I... I lo-… No, I can't say that because I love Kaworu now, can you love more than one person? I suppose you can... The point is I don't want Shinji to be hurt and I don't want to be the cause of pain for him.  
那是我另一个担忧，告诉真嗣我和渚薰的关系。这会伤害他，而且...我真的不想伤害他。我...我喜-…不，我不能这么说，因为我现在爱着渚薰，一个人能同时爱两个人吗？我想是可以的...关键是，我不想让真嗣受伤，也不想成为他痛苦的源头。

These are all thoughts for later though, we can deal with this when we have to. For now, I need to get a few things straight, Kaworu is not going to abandon me. I know that there might be awkwardness when we all reunite but we can deal with it there and then. All that matters right now is sorting out these ridiculous old men who have deemed it necessary to block my boyfriend from being able to live his life.  
不过这些都是以后再考虑的事情，到时候我们自然会处理。眼下，我需要理清一些事情，渚薰不会离开我。我知道当我们重聚时可能会有点尴尬，但我们可以当场解决。现在最重要的是，要搞定这些荒谬的老头子，他们竟然认为有必要阻止我男朋友过自己的生活。

I remain in the seat for a couple more minutes in this stupid and silent waiting room. I hate this room, there isn't even a television in here to provide some sort of distraction just a crappy uncomfortable seat, four white walls, a fake cactus in the corner and a fish bowl sans fish.  
我在这间愚蠢而寂静的等候室里又坐了几分钟。我讨厌这个房间，连个电视都没有，一点分散注意力的东西都没有，只有一个破旧不舒服的座位，四面白墙，角落里一个假仙人掌，还有个空鱼缸。

Finally, after what feels like an eternity the door to the main meeting room opens. An older lady walks out to greet me, she's wearing a full suit, dour expression and a voice that would make Rei sound expressive.  
终于，在仿佛永恒的等待后，主会议室的门打开了。一位年长的女士走出来迎接我，她身着全套西装，表情严肃，声音之冷能让丽听起来都显得富有表情。

"Ms Soryu, the council are now ready to see you."  
“草薙小姐，委员会现在准备见您了。”

"Finally." I mutter under my breath.  
“终于。”我低声咕哝道。

She gives me a quick glare as if she has heard me but then turns away, "The council are already seated, you will go to your designated seat and they will begin."  
她迅速瞪了我一眼，仿佛听见了我的话，随即转过身去，“议会成员已经就座，你将前往指定的座位，他们即将开始。”

As I enter the room a final wave of thoughts washes over me. Have they already spoken to Shinji? Has their decision already been made? Is there anything I can do to tip them over the edge? Am I at risk of reversing their decision?  
当我踏入房间，最后一波思绪涌上心头。他们是否已经与真嗣交谈过？他们的决定是否已经做出？我能否做些什么来影响他们的决断？我会否有风险逆转他们的决定？

I suppose I won't know until after this is done. I walk straight into the room and I feel the cold stares of the council members. The room isn't very well lit and from a brief glance seems fairly sparse. The table at the center is what I expected, large, wooden and round. The chair for me is one of those large office chairs that reminds me of something from a villain in a Bond movie might have.  
我想，这一切只有等结束后才能知晓。我径直走进房间，感受到议会成员冰冷的目光。房间照明不佳，粗略一看显得相当空旷。中央的桌子正如我所料，宽大、木制且圆形。我的椅子是那种大型办公椅，让我联想到邦德电影中的反派可能会拥有的那种。

I sit myself down and allow a quick look at the nine representatives, my enemies for today. Directly opposite me is a round bald-headed man, he actually looks like he could be the brother of the man who owns the café near to my old apartment. His demeanor doesn't seem to be the same as many politicians but I know myself how deceiving looks can be.  
我坐了下来，迅速打量了一下今天的九位对手。正对面是一个圆脸秃顶的男人，他看起来简直像是那位在我旧公寓附近开咖啡馆的老板的兄弟。他的举止并不像许多政客那样，但我知道外表是多么具有欺骗性。

The other eight are a mixture of nationality and gender, some seem to be more sour-faced and what I'd expect from a politician. One of them in particular is staring straight at me as if I was the biggest piece of trash in existence.  
其他八人则是国籍和性别的混合体，有些人看起来一脸不悦，正是我对政客的预期形象。其中一位特别直勾勾地盯着我，仿佛我是世上最大的垃圾。

Well fuck you too. 好吧，你也是。

"Ms Soryu, our apologies for keeping you waiting." The man who for now I'll call Obelix announces, his voice is loud and clear.  
"草薙小姐，很抱歉让您久等了。" 这位我暂时称之为奥贝利克斯的男人宣布道，他的声音响亮而清晰。

I give a confident smirk and feel that piercing glare from the committee members intensify. I imagine they will all know who I am and they will probably know who I was. I wonder if the person they see before the today is what they expect. I wonder if they're expecting 'her' or for me to have changed.  
我自信地微微一笑，感觉到委员会成员们的锐利目光更加强烈了。我想他们会都知道我是谁，也许还会知道我曾经的身份。我不知道他们今天见到的人是否符合他们的预期。我不知道他们是在期待'她'，还是期待我有所改变。

"Now at all." I nod politely, "I haven't been here for too long."  
"一点儿也不久。" 我礼貌地点头回应，"我并没有等太久。"

"It is the understanding of the committee that you wish to bring forth an appeal to our decision to block Kaworu Nagisa from travelling outside of Germany."  
"委员会理解您希望对我们阻止渚薰离开德国的决定提出上诉。"

"That is correct." I reply.  
""是的，没错。"" 我回答道。

"This meeting today along with our meeting with your former teammate Shinji Ikari will therefore aid us in establishing whether or not we should reverse that decision. Does anyone have any objections?"  
"今天的会议以及与您前队友碇真嗣的会面将帮助我们确定是否应该撤销该决定。有人有异议吗？"

I shake my head and listen to the others. No one offers any objections to his request and then they all move into introducing themselves and the country they represent. I feign interest but in truth I couldn't care less if they represent one country or another. I just want them to change their minds.  
我摇了摇头，听着其他人说话。没有人对他的请求提出异议，然后他们都开始介绍自己和所代表的国家。我假装感兴趣，但实际上我根本不在乎他们代表哪个国家。我只希望他们能改变主意。

The last guy does intrigue me though. He's representing Japan and he addresses me with such disdain that I wonder if perhaps I have offended him in the past. I can't say I recognize him nor do I recognize his name. For all the trouble I might have been at NERV I did make sure to remember the names of the techs and people who helped me, I even donated some of my salary to them when I could. Shiro Tokita was not one of the people I remember being on that list.  
不过，最后那个人确实引起了我的兴趣。他代表日本，对我说话时带着明显的轻蔑，让我怀疑自己是否在过去冒犯过他。我既不认识他，也不记得他的名字。尽管我在 NERV 可能惹了不少麻烦，但我确实努力记住了那些帮助过我的技术人员和同事的名字，甚至在可能的时候捐出了部分薪水给他们。白户时太并不是我记得的那份名单上的人。

"So, with introductions now complete, shall we begin?" The jolly man in charge announces and I prepare myself for what will come next.  
“那么，介绍完毕，我们可以开始了吗？”负责的乐呵呵的男人宣布道，我准备好迎接接下来将要发生的事情。

**Tokyo 2 – UN Embassy – Meeting Room – Shinji Ikari  
东京 2 区 – 联合国大使馆 – 会议室 – 碇真嗣**

"Mr Ikari, or would you prefer Shinji?" The rounded gentleman asks me.  
“碇先生，或者您更愿意我们称呼您为真嗣？”那位圆脸的绅士问我。

I immediately feel all nine sets of eyes on me as he asks his question and my cheeks burn up instantly. My mind immediately jumps into overdrive wondering how I should answer him. Is this some sort of trick question? Is this a test? Should I keep it formal or should I allow them to call me by my first name? What would they prefer to do? They are all older than me, therefore they should be the ones to decide, shouldn't they?  
他一问出这个问题，我立刻感觉到九双眼睛齐刷刷地盯着我，我的脸颊瞬间烧得通红。我的思绪立刻高速运转，思考着该如何回答。这是某种陷阱问题吗？这是考验吗？我应该保持正式还是允许他们叫我的名字？他们更倾向于哪种方式？他们都比我年长，所以应该由他们来决定，不是吗？

"S-Shinji is fine." I finally say after a little bit more internal debate.  
"新-新治没事。" 经过一番内心的争论，我终于说道。

"Very well, Shinji it is..." He pauses for a moment, "So, we understand that both yourself and Ms Soryu would like to appeal our decision regarding Mr Nagisa. First of all, I would like to ask, are you aware of why we made that decision?"  
"很好，新治就新治吧……" 他顿了一下，"那么，我们了解到你和源氏都希望对关于渚的决定提出上诉。首先，我想问一下，你们知道我们做出这个决定的原因吗？"

I allow myself to look around the room at the faces of each person, despite them not being here physically and the emitters that are beaming their images in make it appear like they are. I can see each one has their eyes trained on me, each one of them expecting an answer promptly it seems. I feel a level of discomfort matching that of those rare occasions I'd find myself in my father's office.  
我让自己环视房间里的每一张面孔，尽管他们并非亲自到场，而是通过发射器将他们的影像投射进来，使其看起来像是在场。我能看到每个人的目光都集中在我身上，似乎每个人都期待着我迅速给出答案。我感到一种不适，与那些罕见地发现自己身处父亲办公室的时刻相当。

I fight back an urge to take a deep breath, I want to look confident in here and not nervous. Instead I try to place my arms on the table confidently. I bring up my hands and fold them just under my chin and nod.  
我强忍住深呼吸的冲动，想要在这里显得自信而非紧张。于是我试着将双臂自信地放在桌子上。我抬起手，将它们折叠在下巴下方，并点了点头。

"Yes, you believe that allowing Kaworu to travel outside of Germany puts the world at risk. You do not trust that he is completely human."  
“是的，你认为允许渚薰离开德国会对世界构成威胁。你不相信他是完全的人类。”

"Hah! Well he does know something after all!" I hear one of the women to my left scoff, I ignore her as best I can. I've barely been in this room and spoken to these people for ten minutes and I already dislike the majority of them.  
“哈！他毕竟还是知道些什么的！”我听到左边的一位女士嗤之以鼻，我尽可能地忽视她。我在这个房间里才待了不到十分钟，和这些人交谈过，就已经对大多数人产生了反感。

The man in charge does not flinch or acknowledge her statement. Instead he continues to look at me, his tone is light, "Correct. Now, this was not a decision we came to lightly. As the appeal pointed out, we are dealing with a person's freedom and right to live their life. You understand this?"  
负责的男人没有退缩或回应她的话。相反，他继续看着我，语气轻松，“正确。现在，这不是我们轻易做出的决定。正如上诉所指出的，我们处理的是一个人的自由和生活的权利。你明白这一点吗？”

I take a moment to think about it, Misato did warn me about how these people might speak to me. I don't want to say or do anything that might put Kaworu at risk. I don't want to make it seem like I doubt Kaworu. I do however nod, "Yes, I understand."  
我花了一点时间思考，美里确实警告过我这些人可能会如何与我交谈。我不想说或做任何可能危及薰的事情。我不想让人觉得我怀疑薰。然而，我点了点头，“是的，我明白。”

"Where there is any doubt at all we have to act in the best interests of humanity. With that in mind, can you seriously say you doubt our decision?"  
“只要有任何疑虑，我们都必须以人类的最高利益行事。考虑到这一点，你能认真地说你怀疑我们的决定吗？”

I turn to face the source of the question and come face to face with Shiro Tokita, the man who has been staring at me with a large amount of disdain since I arrived. There is a smugness to his voice that triggers some anger within me, I already seriously dislike him.  
我转身面对提问的来源，迎面撞上了土田四郎，自从我到达这里以来，他一直用大量的蔑视目光盯着我。他声音中的自鸣得意激起了我的一些愤怒，我已经开始严重不喜欢他了。

"Yes, I do because I don't believe he is a threat to humanity."  
“是的，我这么认为，因为我不相信他对人类构成威胁。”

"Hmph, an Ikari willing to put the world at risk for their own desires, like fa-"  
“哼，一个为了自己欲望愿意将世界置于险境的碇，就像……”

"Enough!" The man in charge interrupts him sharply as I feel myself tense up. This man was about to mention my father and compare me to him, he's trying to anger me and it's working. I try to calm myself as the chairman speaks, "I would ask that people maintain some form of calm during today's meeting and remember who we are. I would also ask that Shinji is offered the respect that he deserves."  
“够了！”负责人厉声打断了他，我感到自己紧张起来。这个人即将提到我的父亲并拿我与他比较，他试图激怒我，而且成功了。我试图平复自己的情绪，主席开口说道：“我恳请大家今天在会议上保持一定的冷静，并记住我们的身份。我也希望诸位能给予真嗣应有的尊重。”

Tokita falls silent but I feel more intensity from his gaze now, the other woman in the room seems to have backed away. I wonder just what sort of impression I've made, am I doing a good job or have I already messed this up. I can't help but think about how Asuka is or has done, she has a much shorter temper than I do.  
Tokita 沉默了，但我感到他的目光更加强烈，房间里的另一位女士似乎已经退缩了。我不知道自己给人留下了什么样的印象，我做得好吗，还是已经搞砸了。我不禁想到明日香会怎么做，她的脾气比我短得多。

Another woman now speaks up, the representative from the United Kingdom. She is more softly spoken than the others who have spoken up so far, "Perhaps it would be more useful if we could hear more from Shinji about Mr Nagisa. Starting from the time you met him, our own information is quite sparse concerning those events. Please, can you tell us how you met Mr. Nagisa."  
另一位女士开口了，来自英国的代表。她的声音比之前发言的人都柔和，“也许我们能从真嗣那里了解更多关于碇先生的信息。从你们相遇的时候开始，我们关于那些事件的资料相当匮乏。请告诉我们，你是如何遇见碇先生的。”

I nod my head as I take a moment to try to recall those moments as best I can. It has been some time since I have thought about those moments in full. I have thought about little parts here and there, I've had nightmares about those times but I usually avoid thinking about it. I can't avoid it today, I need to confront this part of my past if I am to help Kaworu and Asuka.  
我点点头，花了一些时间尽力回忆那些时刻。已经有一段时间我没有完整地思考过这些了。我零星地想起一些片段，那些时光也曾在梦中困扰我，但我通常避免去想它。今天我无法回避，如果我要帮助渚薰和明日香，就必须面对这段过去。

I wonder just how much they do know at this point, if I should tell them everything or keep the details loose and fill them in if they need me to. There was so much happening at that moment in time, Asuka was in the hospital, Rei had been killed and brought back in her third body, I couldn't face Misato and the city had been evacuated.  
我不禁思考他们此时究竟知道多少，我是应该告诉他们一切，还是保持细节模糊，在他们需要时再补充。那时发生了太多事，明日香在医院，零被杀并以其第三形态复活，我无法面对美里，城市也已疏散。

I settle on just my meeting with Kaworu, "I met him by chance. It was... not too long after the battle with the sixteenth Angel."  
我决定只谈及与渚薰的相遇，“我偶然遇见了他。那是在……与第十六使徒战斗后不久。”

"Were you alone when you met him?" She asks me.  
"你遇到他的时候是一个人吗？" 她问我。

I nod, "Yes. I was near to one of the lakes in the Geofront."  
我点头，"是的。我在地表湖附近。"

"Where was everyone else?"  
"其他人都在哪儿？"

"Asuka was... currently in the hospital, I do not know where Rei was and Misato was busy working." I reply, trying to give as honest an answer as I can.  
“明日香目前在医院，我不知道绫波在哪里，而美里正忙于工作。”我回答道，尽量给出最诚实的答案。

"So, you were completely alone at the lakeside, what happened next?"  
“那么，你在湖边完全是一个人，接下来发生了什么？”

"I was standing looking out over the water and then I heard someone humming a tune. I turned around and then I saw Kaworu. He was sat on top of one of the statues that had fallen into the water. He introduced himself to me."  
“我站在那里眺望着水面，然后听到了有人哼着曲子。我转过身，看到了渚薰。他坐在一座倒在水中的雕像上。他向我介绍了自己。”

She nods her head, "When you met Nagisa, would you say there was anything unusual about him?"  
她点点头，“当你遇见渚的时候，你会说他有什么不寻常的地方吗？”

I shake my head, "No... I wouldn't."  
我摇摇头，“不……我不会。”

Once again, I feel the states of the committee on me and I feel a brief moment of embarrassment. I've spoken about my meeting with Kaworu very rarely and most of those times were responding to others. When I look back on that first meeting I do wonder why I didn't notice anything being off about him. He appeared so quickly, he knew things about me and the way he spoke was so unusual.  
又一次，我感受到委员会对我的审视，感到一阵短暂的尴尬。我很少谈及与薰的初次相遇，大多数时候都是回应他人。当我回想起那次初遇时，我确实想知道为什么我没有注意到他有什么不对劲。他出现得如此突然，他了解我的一些事情，而且他说话的方式也非常不寻常。

Maybe I did notice these things but... I was so depserate for friendship and someone to care about me I just didn't care about them.  
也许我确实注意到了这些事情，但是...我那时太渴望友谊和有人关心我了，以至于根本不在乎这些。

"Absolutely nothing at all?" Tokita addresses me again, "You were a trained Evangelion pilot, the savior of humanity and you couldn't sense anything unusual about him? How was this possible? Either you are lying or not quite as sma-"  
“真的一点都没有察觉吗？”常田再次问我，“你可是受过训练的 EVA 驾驶员，人类的救星，怎么可能对他没有任何异常的感觉？这怎么可能？要么你在撒谎，要么你并没有那么聪——”

I begin to open my mouth to reply to him but before I can say anything the chairman speaks once more, "Let us remember Shiro that whilst Shinji was a trained Evangelion pilot he was not trained to weed out and investigate people. He was also a teenager and under a lot of stress and pressure at this time. He had just witnessed a friend's death and almost losing a second friend. I know myself that teenagers are not always the most observant of people under regular conditions."  
我正要张嘴回答他，但还没来得及说出口，主席又开口了，“让我们记住，白，尽管真嗣是受过训练的 EVA 驾驶员，但他并没有受过筛选和调查人员的训练。他当时还是个青少年，承受着巨大的压力和紧张。他刚刚目睹了一个朋友的死亡，差点又失去第二个朋友。我自己也知道，青少年在正常情况下并不总是最善于观察的人。”

His comment raises a small chucken from some members of the room but not from Tokita who just continues to glare at me.  
他的评论让房间里的一些成员发出轻微的笑声，但富田却没有，他只是继续瞪着我。

"Therefore, I think it is fair to cut Shinji some slack in this situation."  
“因此，我认为在这种情况下对真嗣宽容一些是公平的。”

"I did... notice something unusual about him when I met him." I speak up after Tokita falls silent. I wonder if saying this is a mistake but perhaps honesty will help, "He looked... well he reminded me a bit of Rei who I had found out wasn't... human not too long before that. I... guess I didn't think anything of it though. People can... look different, so I didn't see why that mattered."  
“我确实……在见到他时注意到了一些不寻常的地方。”在富田沉默后，我开口说道。我不知道这样说是不是个错误，但或许诚实会有所帮助，“他看起来……嗯，他让我想起了零，而我在那不久前才发现零不是……人类。我……我想我当时并没有多想。人们可以……看起来不同，所以我没觉得这有什么重要的。”

"Quite a mature outlook for someone so young." The woman from before nods, "Was there anything else?"  
"对于如此年轻的人来说，这是一个相当成熟的观点。"之前的那位女士点头道，"还有别的事吗？"

I nod, "Yes, he kept on using the word Lilin which I thought was... odd."  
我点头，"是的，他一直使用'莉莉丝'这个词，我觉得...很奇怪。"

"Lilin?" Tokita speaks again, much to my annoyance, "And this did not raise a red flag? The connection between Lilin and Lilith?"  
"莉莉丝？"时田又开口了，让我颇为恼火，"这难道没有引起你的警觉吗？莉莉丝和莉莉丝之间的联系？"

I shake my head, "No, I... I didn't know what it meant. I thought that because he had come from oversears that it was just a foreign word. Asuka used German words all the time in front of me."  
我摇摇头，“不，我……我不知道那是什么意思。我以为因为他来自 overseers，那只是一个外国词汇。明日香在我面前经常使用德语单词。”

"But by that point you were aware of Lilith, so the connection must have been obvious."  
“但那时你已经知道莉莉丝了，所以这个联系应该是显而易见的。”

"No, at that time I didn't know about Lilith." I reply, "I had seen it but I didn't know..."  
“不，那时我还不知道莉莉丝。”我回答，“我见过它，但我不知道……”

"It seems, Mr Ikari, that there are a number of things that you do not know, nor were you aware of. How therefore, can we take you seriously during this discussion?" Tokita cuts me off and glares at me. I don't feel any intimidation from him, more just irritated and I really do wonder if I have done something wrong to him or if this is just how he is."  
"看来，碇先生，有许多事情你并不知晓，也未曾意识到。那么，我们如何在这次讨论中认真对待你呢？" 土田打断了我，瞪着我。我并未感到他的威胁，只是觉得有些恼火，我真的想知道是否我对他做了什么错事，还是他一贯如此。

"Shiro..." The woman from before speaks up again, "You know just as well as I do that NERV kept a vast number of secrets and gave out misinformation all the time. Shinji will have been a victim of this as well."  
"白..." 之前那位女士再次开口，"你和我一样清楚，NERV 隐藏了大量秘密，并时常散布错误信息。真嗣也是这种行为的受害者。

"indeed!" The man to Tokita's right speaks up, he reminds me a bit of Kaji, "It is pointless to berate him for not knowing something which he had no means to know. Besides we are not here to find out what he knew about NERVs inner workings, we are here to discuss Nagisa. So, let's hear more about that, what was he like when you met him?"  
"确实如此！" 土田右边的那位男士发言了，他让我想起了加持，"责备他不知道那些他无从得知的事情是毫无意义的。况且，我们不是来探究他对 NERV 内部运作的了解，而是来讨论渚的。那么，让我们多听听关于他的事情，你初次见他时，他是怎样的？

**Berlin – UN Embassy – Meeting Room – Asuka Langley Soryu  
柏林 – 联合国大使馆 – 会议室 – 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

Nine pairs of eyes are staring at me right now. I feel like some small prey being circled by a pack of wolves. It makes me uneasy, I know it's a complete different situation but the idea of me fighting alone against a group of foes... It's difficult to not be reminded of that fight.  
此刻有九双眼睛正盯着我。我感觉自己像是一只被狼群围猎的小猎物。这让我不安，我知道情况完全不同，但想到自己孤身对抗一群敌人……很难不让我回想起那场战斗。

I take a quick look around to try to put myself at ease. I try to gauge my foes, some of them look friendly, maybe even sympathetic to me and some of them seem to be not so friendly. In particular, the man named Tokita, is staring at me with such intensity I'd think he was trying to burn a hole through me. Already I get the feeling that he is going to be the one I have to be care with.  
我迅速环顾四周，试图让自己放松。我试图评估我的对手，其中一些人看起来友好，甚至对我抱有同情，而另一些人则显得不那么友好。特别是那个名叫时田的男人，他盯着我，目光之强烈仿佛要将我烧穿。我已经有预感，他将是需要格外小心应对的那个人。

I remind myself one more time that I have to get through this and remain calm. No matter what these people throw at me, no matter how personal they get I have to keep calm and not lose my temper. If I do then this is all over, regardless of what Shinji accomplishes.  
我再次提醒自己，必须度过这一关并保持冷静。无论这些人对我投掷什么，无论他们多么私人化，我都必须保持冷静，不发脾气。如果我失控，那么一切就结束了，无论真嗣取得了什么成就。

"So Ms Soryu." The chairman begins to speak, "It is the committees understanding that would would like to challenge our decision regarding Mr. Nagisa in hopes of reversing it. Is that correct?"  
"那么，Soryu 女士。" 主席开始发言，"委员会的理解是，您希望挑战我们对 Nagisa 先生的决定，以期推翻它。是这样吗？"

"Yes, it is." I reply instantly, nodding my head with some confidence.  
"是的，没错。" 我立即回答，带着几分自信地点头。

"in which case, let us begin. Does anyone have anything to start off with?"  
既然如此，让我们开始吧。有人有什么要先说的吗？

I decide the best from of defense is a good offence and get straight on the attack before any of them have the chance to speak, "You are all wrong about him. You are wrong in thinking he is a threat to anyone."  
我认为最好的防御就是进攻，在他们有机会开口之前，我直接发起攻击，“你们都错了，关于他。你们错在认为他对任何人构成威胁。”

I see some of them look at me in surprise at how I've spoken up straight away. I like that, I want them to be surprised, you think you know Asuka Langley Soryu? You don't, you don't know the real her. I'm not surprised to hear one or two of them scoff at my words, I'm sure Tokita was one of them. I can still feel his eyes on me, and I'm tempted to turn around to him and ask him just what his problem is. Maybe I should charge him a viewing fee.  
我注意到他们中的一些人对我立刻站出来说话感到惊讶。我喜欢这样，我希望他们感到惊讶，你以为你了解惣流·明日香·兰格雷？你并不了解真正的她。听到一两个人对我的话嗤之以鼻，我并不感到意外，我确信常田就是其中之一。我仍能感觉到他的目光在我身上，我忍不住想转身问他到底有什么问题。也许我该向他收取观看费。

"The person you think Kaworu is, that Angel that tried to attack NERV years ago... it isn't really him." I continue to speak, "He knows what he was. He knows what he did and he admits his guilt. He regrets his actions, actions that you all know were born from manipulation of other parties. Now that they no longer exist he is his own person, in addition... he doesn't have any of his abilities as an Angel that he used to."  
"你以为的渚薰，那个多年前试图攻击 NERV 的天使...那其实并不是真正的他。" 我继续说道，"他知道自己曾经是什么。他知道他所做的一切，并承认自己的罪行。他对自己被他人操纵所做出的行为感到后悔，这些行为你们都清楚。现在那些操纵者已不复存在，他成为了独立的个体，而且...他不再拥有曾经作为天使的任何能力。"

I trail off and the room goes silent. I see them exchange a few glances and wonder who will be next to speak. Actually, I already know who is going to speak and sure enough after only a few seconds more he opens his mouth.  
我话音渐落，房间陷入沉默。我看到他们交换了几眼，好奇接下来谁会发言。实际上，我已经知道谁会开口，果然，只过了几秒钟，他就张开了嘴。

"Well... Those are some strong words Soryu." Tokita speaks, I don't even get a 'Ms Soryu' from him, what a prick, "But I would like to ask you how much you really know about Nagisa. We, for instance, know that Nagisa was capable of manipulation. He manipulated the younger Ikari and many at NERV. Could it not just be that you too are being manipulated?"  
"嗯...碇君，这些话很有分量。" 时田开口了，他甚至没称呼我为"碇小姐"，真是个刺头，"但我想要问你，你对渚了解多少？我们，比如说，知道渚有操纵他人的能力。他操纵了年轻的碇，以及 NERV 中的许多人。你难道不会也是被操纵的一员吗？"

He looks at me with a smug confidence, almost as if his question has caught me off guard. I simply turn to him, "No, Kaworu is not manipulating me."  
他带着一种得意的自信看着我，仿佛他的问题让我措手不及。我只是转向他，平静地说：“不，渚薰并没有在操纵我。”

"And you are sure of this because?"  
“你为何如此确定？”

A part of me wants to say that I wouldn't allow myself to be manipulated but it feels like a flimsy answer. In truth I'm not sure what I can say to that. It's just an attempt to make me doubt myself or slip up. Anything I say will be followed with 'Yeah, but how can you be sure?' Any doubt on my part gives them a victory. I'm not planning on losing.  
我内心的一部分想说，我不会允许自己被操纵，但这听起来像是个站不住脚的回答。事实上，我不确定我能对此说什么。这只是试图让我怀疑自己或露出破绽。无论我说什么，都会被反问‘是吗，但你如何能确定？’任何一丝怀疑都会让他们得逞。我没打算输。

Instead I go for a different tactic. I hate talking about myself, my feelings and my life but these people probably know more about me than I can remember. They will appreciate the impact this has.  
我转而采取了另一种策略。我不喜欢谈论自己、我的感受和我的生活，但这些人可能比我自己记得的还要了解我。他们会理解这其中的影响。

"Because I love him." “因为我爱他。”

As I expect, Tokita doesn't seem moved or bothered by my answer. Why should he? He probably doesn't give a crap about it. I do however see a few people exchange glances, I can't imagine the news about my relationship with Kaworu is a surprise to them but to hear me vocalize it might mean something.  
正如我所料，Tokita 似乎并未被我的回答打动或困扰。他为何要在意呢？他可能根本不在乎。不过，我确实看到几个人交换了眼神，我和 Kaworu 的关系对他们来说可能并不意外，但亲耳听到我承认或许意义不同。

"Each one of you probably has access to my records, to all of my psychological evaluations and reports from base commanders. That should be enough to tell you why what I have just said is important. If I had any doubts at all about Kaworu then I wouldn't love him."  
"你们每个人大概都能接触到我的档案，包括所有的心理评估和基地指挥官的报告。这些应该足够说明我刚才所说的重要性。如果我对渚有任何疑虑，我就不会爱他。"

"I fail to see how love proves any-"  
"我不明白爱情怎么能证明任何-"

"Leaving love aside..." The chairman clears his throat and cuts Tokita off, "I do not feel this line of questioning will get us anywhere. We are not hear to discuss Ms. Soryus love life, rather we are here to discuss Mr. Nagisa. Now, in your own time Ms. Soryu can you please tell us about your first meeting with Mr. Nagisa?"  
"抛开爱情不谈..."" 主席清了清嗓子，打断了土岐，""我觉得这种提问方式对我们没有任何帮助。我们不是来讨论索留小姐的爱情生活的，而是来讨论渚先生的。现在，索留小姐，请在您方便的时候告诉我们您第一次见到渚先生的情况好吗？"

"Gladly." I nod my head and turn away from Tokita. I feel like I've won some minor victory against him but this is just the beginning. I can't let myself become too cocky now, "It was a few months ago. I was heading to a small café near my old apartment. He was coming out of it and we collided with each other."  
“乐意之至。”我点点头，转身离开时田。我感觉自己似乎在他面前赢得了一场小小的胜利，但这只是开始。我不能让自己现在变得过于自满，“那是几个月前的事了。我正前往我旧公寓附近的一家小咖啡馆。他正从里面出来，我们撞了个正着。”

I hear a small laugh at my comment. I suppose it is funny, not too many relationships start with a literal collision. The person who did laugh looks towards me, a young man, quite handsome actually and somewhat disheveled addresses me, "Did you know that this person was Kaworu Nagisa when you bumped into him."  
听到我的话，有人轻声笑了出来。我想这确实挺滑稽的，毕竟没多少恋情是从一场真正的碰撞开始的。那个笑出声的人转向我，是个年轻人，相当英俊，只是略显凌乱，他问我：“你撞到他的时候，知道他是渚薰吗？”

I shake my head, "No I didn't."  
我摇摇头，“不，我不知道。”

A woman across from him turns to me, "You didn't recognize him at all? Nagisa has quite a distinct appearance and is a former Evangelion pilot. There was no recognition?"  
对面的一位女士转向我，问道：“你完全没认出他吗？渚薰有着相当独特的相貌，而且曾是 EVA 驾驶员。你一点都没察觉？”

Once again, I shake my head, "No, I didn't. I had no idea who he was. When he was at NERV I was... incapacitated. I had heard there was a replacement but no one had really filled me in on the exact details."  
我再次摇头，“不，我没认出来。我根本不知道他是谁。他在 NERV 的时候，我……处于无意识状态。我听说有人接替了，但没人详细告诉我具体情况。”

"Curious." She muses, "Why did no one tell you of these things?"  
“真奇怪。”她沉思道，“为什么没人把这些事告诉你呢？”

I find myself becoming slightly irritated at her questions, they all must have known what I did... what I tried to do around that time. Why is it so difficult to believe I didn't know who he was. Still, I suppose they probably expect me to have been told or have even seen him before.  
我对她的提问感到些许烦躁，他们肯定都知道我那时做了什么...我试图做的事情。为什么相信我不认识他这么难呢？不过，我想他们大概认为我应该被告知过，或者甚至之前见过他。

"No one told me because those were not pleasant times for me nor the rest of my friends. We prefer to not speak of them, however right or wrong that may be. I didn't know who Kaworu was, I had never met him before I went to NERV nor did I even know there was going to be a fifth child."  
“没人告诉我，因为那对我以及我的朋友们都不是愉快的时光。我们宁愿不提起那些事，无论对错。我不知道卡罗是谁，我去 NERV 之前从未见过他，甚至不知道会有第五个孩子。”

She nods and seems satisfied by my answer. I wonder if this was just a test for me to pass, to make sure what I said lines up with what she knows. A couple of moments later the man from before speaks, "So after this, what happened next?"  
她点头，似乎对我的回答感到满意。我猜这可能只是对我的一次考验，确保我说的与她所知的一致。片刻后，之前那位男士开口问道：“那么，接下来发生了什么？”

I can't help but smile as I recall those moments, "I didn't recognize him but he did recognize me. He took one look at me and ran away. He was terrified of me, he thought I'd recognize him and hurt him. I didn't find out who he was until the next day when I saw Rei."  
我不禁微笑着回忆那些时刻，'我没有认出他，但他认出了我。他看了我一眼就跑开了。他害怕我，以为我会认出他并伤害他。直到第二天我见到丽，我才知道他是谁。'

"This is Rei Ayanami, correct?" I hear another one of them ask.  
“这是绫波丽，对吧？”我听到他们中的另一个问道。

"Yes." I reply. “是的。”我回答道。

"And what was it Rei told you about him?"  
"丽之前跟你说了他什么？"

"She told me who he was and that he was the fifth child. She warned me that he was the final Angel and had been sent to NERV by SEELE. She told me all about what had happened between him and Shinji and warned me to stay away from him."  
"她告诉我他的身份，他是第五适格者。她警告我他是最后的使徒，被 SEELE 派到 NERV。她告诉我他和真嗣之间发生的一切，并告诫我远离他。"

The all exchange glances, some of them make notes. Tokita returns to his smug smile, once again looking like he has gotten exactly what he wanted.  
众人交换了一下眼神，有些人做着笔记。时田又恢复了得意的笑容，再次显得他得到了他想要的东西。

"So, Rei Ayanami beleives him to be dangerous?"  
"那么，绫波零认为他很危险吗？"

"Believed." I fire back, "She believed him to be dangerous based on what she knew of him and what he used to be. She has since changed her views."  
"曾经认为。" 我反驳道，"她根据对他的了解和他过去的行为，认为他很危险。但她后来改变了看法。"

"And yet I do not see her here before us, nor does she seem to have lent her support to yourself or the younger Ikari in this matter. I therefore have to wonder what her true feelings are." He speaks as I resist the urge to reach over the table and slap him.  
"然而，我既没看到她出现在我们面前，也没发现她在这件事上支持你或年轻的碇。所以我不得不怀疑她的真实感受。" 他说着，我强忍住越过桌子给他一巴掌的冲动。

He knows why Rei isn't here, we were only allowed two people to plead our case and that was both me and Shinji. He's just trying to wind me up and confuse the matter. They all know why Rei isn't here.  
他知道丽为什么没来，我们只被允许两个人来申诉，那就是我和真嗣。他只是在试图激怒我并混淆问题。他们都知道丽为什么没来。

The woman from before seems to have ignored Tokita, "Despite the warnings from Ms. Ayanami, you visited Nagisa anyway though?"  
之前那位女士似乎忽略了土田，"尽管有绫波小姐的警告，你还是去了渚那里，对吧？"

"Yup." "嗯哼。"

"Can you tell us why?" She asks, "Were you not frightened of him after what you had been told?"  
“你能告诉我们为什么吗？”她问，“在你被告知那些事后，你难道不害怕他吗？”

I shake my head, "No, not at all. I kept in mind what Rei had told me, I was prepared for something to happen but I guess... I was intrigued more than anything. The person she had described was not the same as the one I had bumped into. After all, if he was this evil and powerful being then why would he run from me?"  
我摇了摇头，“不，一点也不。我记得丽告诉我的话，我本以为会发生什么，但我想...我更多的是感到好奇。她描述的那个人和我撞上的那个不一样。毕竟，如果他是个如此邪恶且强大的存在，那他为什么要从我身边逃走呢？”

I pause for a moment, "I know myself how much people can change so... I thought I'd take a look for myself. Besides he had... dropped some documents when he ran into me. I figured they were important so wanted to give them back to him."  
我顿了一下，“我知道人能改变多少，所以...我想亲自看看。而且他...撞到我时掉了一些文件。我想它们很重要，所以想还给他。”

"And what sort of documents were these?" Tokita barks at me.  
“这些文件是什么样的？”时田对我吼道。

"They were application forms to help him get a license to teach music." I reply calmly, "It's something he does every Monday."  
“这是帮他申请音乐教师执照的表格。”我平静地回答，“他每周一都会做这件事。”

The chairman nods and smile, "Indeed, this is something we are all aware of. Some of the paperwork had to be approved by us when he went through the process, nothing major just ensuring there was no risk."  
主席点头微笑，“确实，这一点我们都很清楚。他办理手续时有些文件需要我们审批，没什么大问题，只是确保没有风险。”

I continue to tell my story, "When I arrived at his apartment he took one look at me and nearly slammed the door in my face. He was terrified of me, he thought I was there to hurt him. I, of course, was not there to hurt him and tried to explain that to him. I finally got him to calm down and he invited me into his apartment."  
我继续讲述我的经历，“当我到达他的公寓时，他一看到我就差点把门摔在我脸上。他非常害怕我，以为我是来伤害他的。当然，我并不是来伤害他的，我试图向他解释这一点。最终，我让他平静下来，他邀请我进了他的公寓。”

"So, he got you into his apartment." I hear Tokita say darkly, as if me going into Kaworu's apartment was part of some grand plan, "And he did not try to do anything to me?"  
"这么说，他把你带进了他的公寓。" 我听到常田阴沉地说，仿佛我进入渚的公寓是某个宏大计划的一部分，"他没对我做什么吧？"

I shoot him a glare, "Believe me, if he had have tried something then he would have had something to fear. So, no, Kaworu did not try anything. He was a perfect gentleman."  
我瞪了他一眼，"相信我，如果他真有什么企图，那他就有得怕了。所以，不，渚什么都没做。他表现得像个十足的绅士。"

I turn away from Tokita, "He was still scared of me as I went in there. When I got in, I saw his apartment was empty aside from a few small bits and pieces. Essentials and a small keyboard. I guess... I felt bad for him, he had been back for all those months but it seemed like he wasn't living a life. So, I invited him out to a concert."  
我转过身去，不再理会常田，"他当时还是怕我进去。我进去后，看到他的公寓除了几件小东西外几乎是空的。只有一些必需品和一个小键盘。我想... 我为他感到难过，他已经回来好几个月了，但看起来他并没有真正生活。所以，我邀请他去听一场音乐会。"

"interesting." The scruffy guy from before speaks, "So this was the first proper meeting between the two of you. What happened in the weeks that followed?"  
"有趣。" 之前那个邋遢的家伙开口了，"这么说，这是你们俩第一次正式见面。之后几周发生了什么？"

**Tokyo 2 – UN Embassy – Meeting Room – Shinji Ikari  
东京 2 号 – 联合国大使馆 – 会议室 – 碇真嗣**

"Kaworu was... kind to me." I tell them, my eyes remain glued to the table, "He seemed nice and I actually felt... comfortable around him."  
"渚薰对我...很友善。" 我告诉他们，目光依旧紧盯着桌面，"他看起来很好，我甚至感到...在他身边很自在。"

"So, would you say there was a romantic attachment there?" Tokita asks me.  
"那么，你会说那里存在浪漫的情感吗？" 时田问我。

I feel my cheeks glow red immediately at him asking but I try to not show that his question has bothered me. I turn and glare at him, I can see the smugness on his face as he looks back at me for a reply. I wonder if he is being this was or was this way with Asuka as well, I only hope she can stay calm with him.  
听到他的问题，我立刻感到脸颊发烫，但我尽量不表现出他的问题让我困扰。我转过头瞪着他，我能看到他脸上得意的表情，他正期待着我的回答。我不知道他是否对明日香也这样，我只希望她能保持冷静。

"I asked you a question Ikari." Tokita prompts me like some teacher talking down to a student.  
"我问你问题了，碇。" 时田催促我，像老师对学生说话一样。

"I'm not quite sure how relevant this is." I hear one of the other men opposite him suddenly speak as I struggle to find some sort of answer. In a way I want to be honest about this, I want to tell them the truth about how I felt for Kaworu but I've never really told anyone how I felt. The truth is that, yes, despite barely knowing him I did feel something for him.  
"我不太确定这有多相关。" 我正努力寻找某种答案时，听到他对面的另一个男人突然开口。在某种程度上，我想诚实地表达这一点，我想告诉他们我对渚的感情真相，但我从未真正向任何人透露过我的感受。事实是，是的，尽管对他了解甚少，我的确对他产生了某种情感。

I felt something for Kaworu, I liked the way he looked, I liked the way he smiled, I liked the way he spoke and I could see myself in his arms. There was only one other person I could see myself with and who I felt that way for, and that was Asuka.  
我对渚有感觉，我喜欢他的外表，我喜欢他的微笑，我喜欢他的谈吐，我能想象自己在他的怀抱中。只有另一个人我能想象与自己在一起，并对她有同样的感觉，那就是明日香。

"This line of questioning is relevant because I would like to establish Ikari's motives for doing this. A potential romantic interest means we can bring into question the truth of Ikari's statements, after all love can make us act strange, can it not?"  
"这种提问方式是相关的，因为我希望确定碇的动机。潜在的浪漫兴趣意味着我们可以质疑碇的陈述的真实性，毕竟爱情会让我们行为怪异，不是吗？"

"Yes!" I cut him off because he can say anything else. I shift my gaze again towards Tokita and glare at him, "Yes, I did feel something for him. I was attracted to him."  
"是的！" 我打断了他，因为他可能会说别的。我再次将目光转向时田，瞪着他，"是的，我确实对他有感觉。我被他吸引了。"

"interesting, and would you say you still have those feelings now?" He asks me.  
"有意思，那你会说你现在还有这些感觉吗？" 他问我。

I shake my head, "I don't know, my feelings are complicated."  
我摇摇头，"我不知道，我的感情很复杂。"

"Well can I perhaps ask, have you spoken to Nagisa since he has returned?"  
"那么，我是否可以问一下，自从渚回来后，你和他谈过了吗？"

I nod, "Once, it... did not go well. We weren't ready to speak."  
我点点头，"只谈过一次，那...不太顺利。我们还没准备好交流。"

"I see, so then you will not know about his ongoing romance with your former colleague I assume?"  
"我明白了，那么你大概不知道他和你的前同事正在进行的恋情吧？"

My stomach drops immediately on hearing him say those words. I don't even need him to speak them again, I heard them clearly and from the look on his face I don't think he is making it up. I keep my gaze locked on him as my body reacts in other ways. I try to not sure what he has said affected me but I can feel it, my stomach is churning, the sweat on my body and my legs are shaking.  
听到他说出那些话，我的心立刻沉了下去。我甚至不需要他再重复一遍，我已经听得清清楚楚，从他的表情来看，我不认为他在编造。我保持着目光紧锁在他身上，同时我的身体也在做出反应。我试图不让自己被他的话所影响，但我能感觉到，我的胃在翻腾，全身冒汗，双腿颤抖。

Asuka... and Kaworu? They are together? It... It can't be true... can it? T-They have been spending a lot of time together and Asuka was very keen to help him. I... They never told me... No one told me... Asuka didn't tell me and Rei... Does Rei know? S-She... She must have done, she knew Asuka more than anyone recently.  
明日香...和薰？他们在一起了？这...这不可能是真的...吧？他们最近经常在一起，明日香也非常热心地帮助他。我...他们从未告诉我...没人告诉我...明日香没告诉我，绫波...绫波知道吗？她...她一定知道，她最近比任何人都更了解明日香。

"I take it from your silence that you... were not aware of this fact?" Tokita asks me, snapping me away from my thoughts.  
“从你的沉默来看，你...对此并不知情？”时田问我，打断了我的思绪。

"N-No... I wasn't." "不...我没有。"

"Tokita!" The man opposite him speaks again, "Where are you going with this, this is hardly relevant to what we are doing."  
"时田！"" 对面的人再次开口，""你这是要去哪儿，这跟我们正在做的事情毫不相关。"

"Oh, I think it is." Tokita replies, "It is documented that Ikari had feelings for Ms. Soryu and you all just heard it yourself that he had interest in Nagisa too. Perhaps his actions here today were just in hope of pleasing one of them in an attempt to rekindle that. Perhaps now that he is aware of the truth we can see honesty from him."  
"哦，我认为很相关。"" 时田回答，""有记录显示碇对草薙小姐有感情，而你们刚才也听到了，他对渚也有兴趣。也许他今天的行为只是为了取悦其中一人，试图重燃那份感情。也许现在他知道了真相，我们就能看到他的诚实了。"

I want to run. I want to throw up. I want to vanish from here and never be a part of this again. A part fo me even wants to laugh at the absurdity of this situation. Asuka and Kaworu... they're a couple and I didn't know.  
我想逃跑。我想呕吐。我想从这里消失，再也不参与这一切。我甚至有一部分想嘲笑这荒谬的处境。明日香和薰……他们是一对，而我却不知道。

There is an awkward silence in the room, no one else here seems to be sure of what to say, Tokita is looking at me, his lips turned upwards in a victorious smile. I hate him. I want to reach out and punch him. I take a few deep breaths, I can't hide that this has bothered me. I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest and Tokita knows it. He knew what that would do to me.  
房间里弥漫着尴尬的沉默，其他人似乎也不知道该说什么，时田正看着我，嘴角上扬，露出胜利的微笑。我恨他。我想伸出手去揍他。我深呼吸几次，我无法掩饰这件事对我的困扰。我感觉自己的心被掏了出来，而时田知道这一点。他知道那会对我造成什么影响。

So, what do I do now? Do I just walk away from this? Do I just give up? Why am I even doing this? To help Kaworu, was that really the reason or was it for Asuka? I had... I had thought that being back in contact with Asuka... maybe there was a chance. I... I love Asuka, I love her so much. I want her to be happy. Nagisa... do I love him? I can't say, I love what I thought he was but I don't know who he is now. Still... he deserves to be happy too.  
那么，我现在该怎么办？我应该就这样走开吗？我应该放弃吗？我为什么要这么做？是为了帮助薰，这真的是原因吗，还是为了明日香？我曾……我曾以为重新与明日香联系……也许还有机会。我……我爱明日香，我非常爱她。我希望她幸福。渚……我爱他吗？我说不上来，我爱我以为的他，但我不知道他现在是谁。尽管如此……他也应该得到幸福。

Both of them deserve to be happy, just like I do. I feel awful, I feel rotten and maybe even betrayed. It would be so easy for me to turn around now and leave this room. To tell them to do what they want with Kaworu but... what would that gain? Would that make me feel any better? Of course, it wouldn't! it'd just prove that side of me that tells me I'm awful right.  
他们俩都值得幸福，就像我一样。我感到糟糕透顶，感觉被背叛了。现在转身离开这个房间，告诉他们随便怎么对待渚薰，这对我来说太容易了。但那样做能得到什么呢？能让我感觉好一点吗？当然不能！那只会证明我内心那个说我糟糕的声音是对的。

That... That would be something that my father would do. He'd turn away if he couldn't get what he wanted but... I'm not him. Asuka and Kaworu... if they're together then... so be it, I don't have a right to be with Asuka. I love her... I want her to be happy and if she is happy with him then I am fine with that. I will deal with it.  
那……那是我父亲会做的事。如果得不到他想要的，他会转身离开……但我不是他。明日香和渚薰……如果他们在一起……那就这样吧，我没有权利和明日香在一起。我爱她……我希望她幸福，如果她和渚薰在一起能幸福，那我也没问题。我会接受这一切。

I take a final deep breath before looking at Tokita's stupid smug face one last time. I feel a confidence build up inside of me that I've not felt before, "I did not know about that but... it changes nothing. I am not doing this because of my feelings for those people. I believe Kaworu has changed, I believe he is a good person and I don't think anyone is at risk. People can change. The people I know now... they aren't the people they used to be. Misato... Rei... Asuka and even me... we're all different, we've all changed and... I think Kaworu has as well."  
我深吸最后一口气，最后一次看向富田那张自鸣得意的蠢脸。我感到一种前所未有的自信在内心升起，“我之前并不知情，但这改变不了什么。我这么做不是因为对那些人的感情。我相信薰已经改变了，我相信他是个好人，我不认为任何人会受到威胁。人是可以改变的。我现在认识的这些人……他们已经不是过去的他们了。美里……丽……明日香，甚至是我自己……我们都变了，我们都不同了，而且……我认为薰也一样。”

"Well that is all well and good..." Tokita starts to reply, he seems slightly taken aback by my reply, "Neither of you were former Angels tasked with destroying mankind. Everything you have just said is inconsequential, it is pure belief and nothing concrete. This is pointless, it is pure emotion and feelings from someone who clearly isn't thinking clearly. Chairman, I suggest we end this."  
“好吧，这听起来都很好……”富田开始回答，他似乎被我的回答稍稍震惊了，“你们俩都不是曾经被赋予毁灭人类使命的天使。你刚才说的那些都是无关紧要的，纯粹是信念，没有任何实质内容。这毫无意义，完全是一个显然不清醒的人的情感和感觉。主席，我建议我们结束这场讨论。”

I sit in silence as I listen to his tirade and begin to question my own actions. Have I actually made a mistake in what I have said? Is he right, is everything I have said based on emotion and belief? That is true, I don't really know Kaworu has changed. I don't know anything really, Asuka asked me to help and I said I would but... I don't really know anything. I don't even know how to feel right now, I'm still in shock after finding out about the two of them.  
我静静地坐着，听着他的长篇大论，开始质疑自己的行为。我是否真的在言语上犯了错？他是对的吗，我所说的一切都基于情感和信念？确实，我并不真正了解碇真嗣是否有所改变。我其实一无所知，明日香让我帮忙，我答应了，但...我真的什么都不了解。我现在甚至不知道该如何感受，得知他们两人的事后，我仍处于震惊之中。

When I think about it, they could be right. What if Kaworu is still dangerous? What if he is still an Angel but we just don't know it yet. He could be really good at hiding it, he might not even know it himself. What if I'm making a mistake here? I...  
仔细想想，他们可能是对的。如果碇真嗣仍然危险怎么办？如果他仍然是一个使徒，而我们只是尚未发现。他可能非常擅长隐藏，甚至他自己也可能不知道。我在这里会不会犯了一个错误？我...

"I am still not convinced." A woman directly next to the chairman speaks. I think out of all the people on the table she is the only one who has not yet said anything outside of the initial introduction.  
“我仍然不相信。”坐在主席旁边的一位女士开口说道。我想，在座的所有人中，她是唯一一个除了最初的介绍外还没有发表任何意见的人。

She seems stern, her eyes piercing and commanding. Tokita falls silent immediately on her speaking and she locks her eyes onto mine.  
她看起来严厉，目光锐利且有威严。她一开口，Tokita 立刻安静下来，她的目光紧锁在我的眼睛上。

"Shinji, first of all thank you for being honest in regards to your feelings for Nagisa. I know such a thing will have been quite difficult. Not only due to his status but also due to certain attitudes in society but your honest does actually help us. I also apologize for any pain the recent revelation might have caused you."  
“真嗣，首先感谢你对渚的感情坦诚相告。我知道这很不容易，不仅因为他的身份，也因为社会上的某些态度，但你的坦诚确实对我们有帮助。同时，对于最近的真相可能给你带来的痛苦，我也表示歉意。”

She flashes a look at Tokita as she says that, it seems him revealing that little bit about Asuka and Kaworu has not impressed her and I wonder if all of these people are on the same page.  
她说这话时瞥了 Tokita 一眼，似乎他对 Asuka 和 Kaworu 的那点透露并未给她留下好印象，我不禁怀疑这些人是否都在同一频道上。

"If you can, I would like you to continue telling us about Nagisa when you met him back then. What sort of person he was before you knew he was an Angel and anything you felt about him when you did find out. Even if you feel it is inconsequential it might help."  
"如果你可以的话，我希望你能继续告诉我们关于你当时遇到渚的事情。在他成为天使之前，他是个怎样的人？以及当你发现他是天使时，你的感受如何？即使你觉得这些无关紧要，也许会有所帮助。"

I nod, "Okay." 我点头，"好的。"

"So, you met Nagisa by the side of a lake, you have already told us this much. I presume you spent most of the day with him after that, can you please tell us what you did during that day."  
"那么，你是在湖边遇到渚的，这一点你已经告诉我们了。我想你们在那之后大部分时间都在一起，请你告诉我们那天你们都做了些什么。"

I nod and try to push out the thoughts of that revelation and instead focus on what is important. I'm going to help them, I am going to help Kaworu. I'm not going to run away, he needs me to help him.  
我点头，试图将那个惊人的事实抛诸脑后，转而专注于真正重要的事情。我要帮助他们，我要帮助渚薰。我不会逃避，他需要我帮助他。

"We had to perform a sync test not long after we first met. That went smoothly but I saw Misato and the others seemed concerned. I didn't think anything of it though, after the test we went to get changed and have a shower. T-There wasn't a lot to do in the city anymore, half of it had been destroyed and pretty much everyone was gone."  
我们初次见面后不久就进行了一次同步测试。那次进行得很顺利，但我注意到美里和其他人似乎有些担忧。不过我当时并没有多想，测试结束后我们就去换了衣服，洗了个澡。城市里已经没什么可做的了，一半已经被摧毁，几乎所有人都离开了。

"You did not return to your own home first?" She asks me, her voice softening.  
“你没有先回自己家吗？”她问我，声音变得柔和。

I shake my head, "N-No... I... I was avoiding it as much as I could. It just made me unhappy being there plus... Misato was always at NERV and Asuka was in the hospital. There was nothing there for me so... I was happy to spend time with Kaworu,"  
我摇摇头，“不……我……我尽可能地避开那里。在那里让我感到不快乐，而且……美里总是待在 NERV，明日香又在医院。那里没有什么值得我留恋的……所以……我很高兴能和薰在一起。”

"When you were with Nagisa did the two fo you discuss NERV, did you maybe tell him anything that might have... unintentionally helped him?"  
“当你和渚在一起时，你们俩有没有讨论过 NERV，你有没有可能无意中告诉了他什么……帮助了他？”

I take a moment to think about our conversations, it is strange but I can still recall most of the details of that day to easily. Finally, I shake my head, "No, he... he seemed more interested in me personally. He wanted to know about me and my friends, he asked me about my father. I... I told him, it was so easy to open up to him. I didn't feel like he was judging me for anything I said he just... listened to me."  
我花了一会儿时间回想我们的对话，虽然奇怪，但我仍然能轻易地回忆起那天的许多细节。最后，我摇了摇头，“没有，他……他似乎对我个人更感兴趣。他想了解我和我的朋友，他问起我的父亲。我……我告诉了他，对他敞开心扉是那么容易。我感觉他并没有评判我说的任何话，他只是……倾听着我。”

"i see." She nods, her expression has softened a little bit when it comes to me. Everyone else in the room seems to have taken a backseat to allow her to speak, even the chairman seems completely silent, "So after spending the night with him, what happened next?"  
"我明白了。" 她点点头，提到我时她的表情稍微柔和了一些。房间里的其他人似乎都退到了次要位置，让她发言，甚至连主席也完全沉默了，"那么，和他共度一夜之后，接下来发生了什么？"

My eyes wander to the table and I reach out to my cup to take a sip of water as the memories of those moments come back to me. I look around to see the other council members looking at me with some curiosity, aside from Tokita.  
我的目光游移到桌子上，伸手去拿我的杯子喝了一口水，那些时刻的记忆又涌上心头。我环顾四周，看到其他议会成员带着些许好奇看着我，除了富田。

"In your own time Shinji." She prompts me.  
"慢慢来，真嗣。" 她催促我。

I take a deep breath, "I woke up when the alarms were going off. I noticed straight away Kaworu wasn't in his bed. I... I didn't know why but I just thought he had gone on ahead to take on the Angel and not woke me up. I put on my clothes and rushed to Eva Unit 01... When I got there... I was told that he was the Angel."  
我深吸一口气，“警报响起时我醒了。我立刻注意到渚薰不在他的床上。我……我不知道为什么，只是以为他先去对付使徒了，没叫醒我。我穿上衣服，急忙赶往 Eva 初号机……当我到达那里时……他们告诉我，他就是使徒。”

"And how did that make you feel?"  
“那让你感觉如何？”

Not quite as bad as finding out the two people you love are in a relationship, my mind quips as I prepare a response.  
“发现你爱的两个人在交往，那种感觉也不比这好多少。”我心里嘀咕着，准备回应。

"I... I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to believe it." I admit, "Kaworu couldn't have been the Angel, he was... so nice but... it was true even if I didn't want it to be. So, I was sent to fight him. When I caught up with him he was floating down towards the lower depths of NERV, he... had an A.T. Field and was somehow controlling Unit 02."  
"我...我无法相信。我不愿相信。" 我承认，"渚薰不可能是使徒，他是...那么善良，但...即使我不愿承认，事实就是如此。因此，我被派去与他战斗。当我追上他时，他正向 NERV 的更深处漂浮下去，他...拥有 A.T.力场，并且不知怎的控制了二号机。"

"So, he had considerable power?"  
"那么，他拥有相当大的力量？"

I nod, "Yes, I would say so."  
我点头，"是的，可以这么说。"

"And when you caught up with him did he say anything to you?"  
"当你追上他时，他对你说了什么吗？"

"Yes." I tell them, "He... He admitted he was an Angel, he told me what the A.T. Field was and I chased him... towards..."  
"是的。" 我告诉他们，"他... 他承认自己是天使，告诉我什么是 A.T.力场，然后我追着他... 向着..."

I drop off and look around the room wondering how much I should reveal. Many parts of this I've never revealed to anyone. I've generally been told to never speak of these moments before but am I safe here? They knew about Lilith so they probably know.  
我停了下来，环顾房间，思考我应该透露多少。这些事情的许多部分我从未向任何人透露过。通常有人告诉我永远不要提及这些时刻，但在这里我安全吗？他们知道莉莉丝，所以他们可能也知道。

The chairman nods, "It is fine, we know about the lower levels of NERV and Lilith."  
主席点头道：“没关系，我们对 NERV 的底层和莉莉丝有所了解。”

I give him a dry smile, "Kaworu approached Lilith and then stopped. He gave me time to catch up to him after I had stopped Unit 02 and then he spoke to me again."  
我对他干笑了一下，“卡罗尔接近了莉莉丝，然后停了下来。在我阻止了二号机之后，他给了我时间追上他，然后再次与我交谈。”

It hurts me so much to think about that day. I knew I would have had to but I didn't realize how much it would hurt. At the same time, I didn't expect to learn about Kaworu and Asuka, that isn't helping me but... I have to fight it. I'm going to let them know that Kaworu isn't a threat.  
"想到那天，我的心痛得难以自持。我知道我不得不这么做，但没想到会如此痛苦。同时，我也没料到会得知卡罗尔和明日香的事，这对我毫无帮助……但我必须与之抗争。我要让他们明白，卡罗尔并非威胁。”

"Why did he wait for you? Could he not have just gone ahead and completed his task?" Another person in the room asks me.  
“他为何要等你？难道不能直接完成任务吗？”房间里的另一个人问我。

"Kaworu was... not there for Lilith and he realized he had been lied to as well. He... said that I should be the one to live and not him... He... understood something that I didn't and I... still don't really understand but he..."  
“渚薰……不在莉莉丝那里，他也意识到自己被骗了。他……说应该活下来的是我而不是他……他……明白了一些我不懂的事，而我……至今仍不太明白，但他……”

My voice starts to tremble as I speak and I swallow down the lump that has formed in my throat. I killed a person on that day, I killed a person and... I've never been able to come to terms with it. I've never wanted to remember it. I hate remembering it. Why have I agreed to this? Why do I have to feel this? It's all... too much. I want to run away but... I'm not going to, I won't run, I won't cry, not here. Not in front of these people and especially not in front of Tokita.  
我说话时声音开始颤抖，咽下了喉咙里形成的硬块。那天我杀了一个人，我杀了一个人……我从未能接受这一点。我从未想过要记住它。我讨厌回忆这件事。我为什么要同意这个？为什么我必须感受这些？这一切……太过沉重。我想逃跑，但……我不会，我不会逃跑，我不会在这里哭泣，尤其不会在这些人面前，更不会在土田面前。

"Kaworu let me kill him... He wanted humanity to live on. He sacrficied himself because he couldn't find any other way. I... I don't think he really wanted to destroy us, when I saw him he was questioning whether humanity really had to die." I look around the room, "If he was still an Angel now... If he still wanted that he could have done it."  
“渚薰让我杀了他...他希望人类能继续生存。他牺牲了自己，因为他找不到其他办法。我...我不认为他真的想毁灭我们，当我见到他时，他在质疑人类是否真的必须灭亡。”我环顾房间，“如果他现在还是使徒...如果他还想要那样，他本可以做到的。”

I take a moment to make sure I'm composed, "I know you all fear him. I know what it is like to be scared but... I don't think he ever wanted to hurt anyone and I don't think he does now. I don't think we should fear him. I... I'm not scared of him and I... I want to see him... so that I can tell him I forgive him. Please... don't let your fear get in the way of his life."  
我稍作停顿，确保自己镇定下来，“我知道你们都害怕他。我知道那种恐惧的滋味，但...我不认为他曾经想要伤害任何人，现在也不这么认为。我不认为我们应该害怕他。我...我不怕他，我...我想见他...这样我才能告诉他我原谅他。请...不要让你们的恐惧妨碍他的生活。”

"Nothing at first, we went to the concert and would message each other a bit. It was only a few weeks later that we started to spend more time together." I answer him before turning my gaze towards the chairman.  
"起初什么都没有，我们去听了音乐会，偶尔会互相发发消息。直到几周后，我们才开始花更多时间在一起。" 我回答他后，将目光转向了主席。

"Did he ask you or did you ask him to see each other again?"  
是他约你还是你约他再次见面？

"Neither." I turn to the source of the voice, "I don't think any of us had the nerve to ask one another despite wanting to. The next time I saw him was after the goons' you people had 'protecting' him decided to beat him up."  
都不是。" 我转向声音的来源，"我觉得我们俩都没勇气主动约对方，尽管心里想这么做。我再次见到他是在你们派来'保护'他的那些家伙决定揍他一顿之后。

I look and see the smile fade from the face of the chairman, he looks regretful. Good, so he should, all of these people should feel regret at that.  
我看着，看到主席脸上的笑容逐渐消失，他显得有些懊悔。很好，他应该这样，所有这些人都应该对此感到后悔。

"Yes, that is something which... I think we all regret." He speaks slowly, "It will be of no solace to yourself or Mr. Nagisa but our screening process has improved and we will continue to do so in the future."  
"是的，那是我们...我想我们都后悔的事情。"他缓缓说道，"这对您或长井先生来说都不是安慰，但我们的筛选程序已经改进，并将继续在未来改进。"

"You're right, it isn't of solace to me but I'm sure Kaworu would feel better at that." I bite back, perhaps I shouldn't have sounded so harsh but thinking about that incident makes my blood boil. I can still remember how he looked when I went to his apartment, I felt so bad, so powerless and all he could do was blame himself.  
"你说得对，这对我来说不是安慰，但我相信薰会因此感到好一些。"我反驳道，也许我不该听起来那么严厉，但想到那次事件就让我怒火中烧。我仍然记得当我去他公寓时他的样子，我感到如此糟糕，如此无助，而他所能做的只是责怪自己。

It does however give me something, "This does raise a point, if Kaworu was, what some of you think he was then do you not think he would have defended himself?"  
然而，这确实给了我一些思考，“这确实提出了一个问题，如果渚薰真的是你们中一些人所认为的那样，那么你们不觉得他会自卫吗？”

"Hah." Tokita smirks at me, "It is something that has been considered but perhaps Nagisa did not want to reveal himself as of yet. Remember we are not just discussing the possibility that he is still an Angel, we are also discussing the possibility that he is still in contact with SEELE. Your point has already been considered and dismissed."  
“哈哈。” 时田对我冷笑道，“这个问题已经考虑过了，但也许渚并不想这么快暴露自己。记住，我们不仅在讨论他是否仍然是使徒，还在讨论他是否仍在与 SEELE 保持联系。你的观点已经被考虑并否定了。”

I really want to punch his stupid, idiotic and smug face but I can't help but feel he has brought up a good point. This whole thing, it hinges on uncertainty, how do we know he is or how do we know he isn't. The truth is we don't, just like I could be an Angel but not know it or Shinji could be. How can I fight back against something like that?  
我真的想揍他那张愚蠢、白痴又自鸣得意的脸，但我不得不承认他提出了一个好问题。这一切都建立在不确定性上，我们怎么知道他是或不是。真相是我们不知道，就像我可能是个使徒但自己不知道，或者真嗣也可能是。我该如何反击这样的事情呢？

All I know is I believe in Kaworu. I believe he isn't a threat and I want them to see that. I mean, the guy can hardly put on a pair of pants without stumbling over, how can he possibly be a threat?  
我所知道的就是我相信卡哇鲁。我相信他不是威胁，我希望他们也能看到这一点。我的意思是，那家伙连穿条裤子都会绊倒，他怎么可能构成威胁呢？

"True." I concede, "But then if he was still in league with someone like SEELE would they have allowed such an attack? Surely, they would not have wanted their agent to come to any harm. Those people you had were highly trained, they knew how to kill someone. It was a risk."  
“确实。”我承认道，“但如果他仍与 SEELE 那样的人合作，他们会允许这样的攻击发生吗？当然，他们不会希望他们的代理人受到任何伤害。你派去的人受过高度训练，他们知道如何杀人。这是一次冒险。”

He simply shakes his head, "Again that is irrelevant. Nagisa was attacked and managed to run away. Yes, it could have been worse but it wasn't. Considering who Nagisa is, I'd say he was lucky."  
他只是摇了摇头，“再说那也无关紧要。渚被攻击了，但他设法逃脱了。是的，情况本可能更糟，但没有。考虑到渚的身份，我得说他算是幸运的。”

"And what exactly do you mean by that?" I feel my hand slam down hard against the table, pain shoots up the side and I wonder for a moment if perhaps I've damaged something. I don't let them see any pain on my face, "Are you suggesting he deserved it?"  
"你这话到底是什么意思？" 我感到自己的手重重地拍在桌子上，疼痛直冲上来，我一时怀疑自己是不是弄坏了什么。我没有让他们看到我脸上的痛苦，"你是说他活该吗？"

"Not at all." He waves a condescending finger in front of my face, "I'm just suggesting that, like you, if could have been a lot worse. I mean, considering who Nagisa is, it is difficult to blame certain parties for feeling they have to take action. Perhaps those men thought they were protecting us."  
"绝非如此。" 他用一种居高临下的手指在我面前挥了挥，"我只是说，就像你一样，本来可能会更糟。我是说，考虑到渚的身份，某些人觉得他们必须采取行动也情有可原。也许那些人认为他们在保护我们。"

I'm about to get to my feet when suddenly a woman to the right of the Chairman speaks up, "I feel that we have spent long enough on this. Tokita, your men were in the wrong for what happened and have been punished accordingly, there is no justification for that shameful attack. Ms. Soryu, we apologize to yourself and Nagisa for what happened."  
我正要站起来，突然董事长右边的一位女士开口了，"我认为我们已经在这件事上花费了太多时间。时田，你的手下做错了事，已经受到了相应的惩罚，那次可耻的袭击没有任何借口。苍龙小姐，我们为发生的事情向您和渚道歉。"

I look again at Tokita, did I hear her correctly? They were... his men? Did he put them in place to watch over Nagisa? It's not worth thinking about now, I can find out later.  
我又看了一眼时田，我听对了吗？他们是...他的人？是他安排他们来监视渚的吗？现在不值得多想，我稍后可以查明。

"Ms. Soryu." The woman speaks again, "It is quite clear to us that you feel strongly about Nagisa's current state. We would like to establish more of a timeline regarding Nagisa. What happened after that incident?"  
“空条女士。”那位女士再次开口，“我们很清楚您对渚目前状况的关切。我们希望更详细地了解渚的时间线。那次事件之后发生了什么？”

"We spent a lot more time together and got to know each other more." I answer calmly, the rage fading away from me slowly.  
“我们花了很多时间在一起，更加了解彼此。”我平静地回答，怒气慢慢从我身上消散。

"Of course, and what did the two of you do?"  
"当然，你们俩都做了些什么？"

I give a small shrug, "Usual things that friends do I guess. We watched movies together, listened to list and played video games. We just enjoyed spending time with each other."  
我微微耸肩，"朋友间常做的事吧。我们一起看电影，听歌，玩电子游戏。就是享受彼此的陪伴。"

"So, when you were with him, did you ever feel threatened by him?"  
"那么，和他在一起时，你有没有感到过被他威胁？"

I shake my head, "No, absolutely not. Kaworu always seemed to be frightened of me. He was... afraid of a lot of things, the attack didn't help that either."  
我摇了摇头，“不，绝对不会。卡沃鲁总是显得很怕我。他……害怕很多事情，那次攻击也没能改善这一点。”

"And did you ever notice anything... unusual about him?" She asks, "Did he ever vanish for an amount of time? Was he ever hard to contact?"  
“那你有没有注意到他有什么……不寻常的地方？”她问道，“他有没有消失过一段时间？或者很难联系上他？”

Again, I shake my head, "I never had a problem contacting him if I wanted to, as far as vanishing went, he might have went for a walk around the local area but that stopped after the attack. Aside from that he didn't really do a lot, it wasn't really until I showed up that he started to do new things."  
我又摇了摇头，“如果我想联系他，从来没遇到过问题，至于消失，他可能只是在附近散步，但那次攻击后就不再这样了。除此之外，他其实没做什么，直到我出现，他才开始尝试新事物。”

"You alluded before to the state of his apartment when you arrived. Can you expand on that?" She asks me.  
"你之前提到过他公寓的状况。能详细说说吗？" 她问我。

I nod, "When I first went into his apartment he had nothing but the essentials in there. He had food, a television, a keyboard and something to play music on. He had only been back for a few months and he didn't really know anything about the world. He didn't really know what to do, like I said he was alive but he wasn't really living a life."  
我点头，"我第一次进他公寓时，里面只有必需品。他有食物、一台电视、一个键盘和播放音乐的设备。他刚回来几个月，对这个世界几乎一无所知。他不知道该做什么，就像我说的，他活着，但并没有真正在生活。"

"I suppose this made you feel bad for him?"  
"我想这让你对他产生了同情？"

I nod again, "Of course, after everything that happened to me I... I recognized some of what he was going through. I had seen it happen with Rei as well and... well Shinji too."  
我再次点头，“当然，经历了那么多之后，我……我能理解他所经历的一些事情。我也看到过丽和……还有真嗣也是如此。”

"So, after this when did you both take it from a friendship to being something more?"  
“那么，在这之后，你们是从什么时候从友谊发展成更进一步的关系的？”

I can see her making notes with each one of my answers and I wonder what exactly she is thinking. It's hard to gauge her, she seems to be giving very little, if anything away. I don't know if what I'm saying is good or bad.  
我可以看到她在我每回答一个问题时都在做笔记，我不知道她到底在想什么。很难揣测她的想法，她似乎很少透露任何信息。我不确定我所说的是好是坏。

"It was a few weeks after the attack, Kaworu had invited me to his apartment for dinner." i start to explain, "I... Something happened whilst I was there and I ended up kissing him. I guess from there we realized we were more than friends. It wasn't really traditional."  
"那是袭击发生后的几周， Kaworu 邀请我去他公寓共进晚餐。" 我开始解释，"我... 在那里发生了一些事情，我最终吻了他。我想从那时起我们意识到彼此不仅仅是朋友。这并不算传统。"

"It rarely is." She remarks, "I think I've asked all I need to for now. Thank you."  
"很少有传统的。" 她评论道，"我想我现在问得差不多了。谢谢你。"

The room now falls silence, is this the end of it? I look between them all as they all make notes. What do I do now? Have they made up their minds or do I still have some time left? I wonder how this is going to go, no, I know how this is going to go. They're going to go away and tell me they've reverse their decision and Kaworu will be able to come with me to Japan.  
房间里现在陷入了沉默，这是结束了吗？我看着他们所有人都在做笔记。我现在该怎么办？他们已经做出决定了吗，还是我还有些时间？我想知道这会怎么发展，不，我知道这会怎么发展。他们会离开并告诉我他们已经改变了决定，Kaworu 将能够和我一起去日本。

"Ms. Soryu, I just had a few questions about you." One of the men to my left suddenly starts to speak, "It's just regarding your service record. It would be fair to say that you had something of a troubled upbringing, am I correct?"  
“Soryu 女士，我有些关于您的问题。”我左边的一个男人突然开口，“只是关于您的服役记录。可以说您有一个颇为坎坷的童年，我这么理解对吗？”

I nod my head slowly, I don't like where this is going already. What does my upbringing have to do with this?  
我缓缓点头，已经感觉到不妙。我的童年与此有何关系？

"I know this might not seem relevant to you but we do want to explore all possibilities here. It's a sensitive issue so we would ask for your cooperation. Now, you were put into the Evangelion project from a young age, in fact it could probably be said that you were put into it as soon as you were born?"  
“我知道这可能对您来说不相关，但我们确实想探究所有可能性。这是一个敏感问题，所以我们希望得到您的配合。那么，您从小就被纳入 EVA 计划，实际上，可以说您一出生就被纳入了？”

"Yes, that is true." I nod again, "I was around the age of four when I was 'selected'"  
"是的，这是真的。" 我再次点头，"我在四岁左右时被'选中'"

"Our records do state that when it came to certain aspects of your training you were exceptional. You were remarkable in your studies, in fact I believe you managed to obtain a college degree at the age of 13."  
"我们的记录确实表明，在某些训练方面你非常出色。你在学习上表现卓越，事实上，我相信你在 13 岁时就获得了大学学位。"

I nod proudly, "Yes, my tutors thought I was very advanced for my age and I was convinced to study at that level."  
我自豪地点头，"是的，我的导师们认为我远超同龄人，并说服我进行那样的学习。"

"Quite a remarkable achievement for a young girl, you must have been proud."  
"对于一个年轻女孩来说，这真是一项了不起的成就，你一定感到很自豪。"

I was proud, keyword being was but when I look back on it I was miserable. What did my degree get me? All it was, was another weapon I could use to inform people how much better I was than they were. What did it get me, aside from allowing me to feel more isolated from others? Proud? Not a chance.  
我确实曾感到自豪，关键在于‘曾’，但当我回顾过去，我其实很痛苦。我的学位给我带来了什么？它不过是我用来告诉别人我比他们优秀多少的另一种武器。除了让我感到更加孤立于他人之外，它还给了我什么？自豪？根本不可能。

"Whilst you excelled in these areas, your record shows that there were difficulties in other places. I think it would be fair to say you were something of a… problem child."  
"尽管你在这些领域表现出色，但你的记录显示在其他地方存在困难。可以说，你有点像是个……问题儿童。"

I look at him and give an embarrassed smile, "I was… a bit of a handful. I admit that much, what is your point?"  
我看着他，尴尬地笑了笑，“我确实……有点难缠。这一点我承认，你到底想说什么？”

"His point…. I believe." Tokita does not give the man a chance to speak, "Is that you had a problem with authority. We know how you berated your colleagues and your superiors, how you often defied orders in training and treated your guardians poorly. It is of course understandable that someone in your position would have lashed out."  
“他的观点……我相信。”时田不给那人说话的机会，“就是说你对权威有意见。我们都知道你是如何斥责同事和上级的，如何在训练中经常违抗命令，以及如何恶劣地对待你的守护者。当然，处于你这种位置的人会发泄情绪，这是可以理解的。”

He pauses for a moment, "Revenge against those who wronged you, it's understandable and with Nagisa you have an opportunity to take revenge against a world that wronged you. How can we know that you are simply not just covering for him, or are even in league with him?"  
他顿了一下，“向那些伤害你的人复仇，这是可以理解的，而有了渚，你有了向这个亏待你的世界复仇的机会。我们怎么能确定你不是在为他掩饰，甚至与他勾结呢？”

I feel my hand clench into a fist at his words but I manage to restrain myself. That is what he wants, he wants me to lash out. Any moment where I slip will just give him a victory, I won't give him the satisfaction.  
听到他的话，我感到自己的手紧握成拳，但我尽力克制住自己。这就是他想要的，他想让我爆发。任何我失态的时刻都只会让他得逞，我不会让他得意的。

I reply to him, as calmly as I can but unable to keep the snarl out of my voice, "Whatever happened in my past is in my past. I've done as much as I can to move away from that and the hideous wreck of a person I used to be. Yes, I do hate a lot of those people, the ones who saw me as a tool and nothing else. The ones who aided in murdering my mother but those people… SEELE were among them, and they're long gone now."  
我尽可能平静地回答他，但无法完全掩饰声音中的咆哮，"我过去发生的一切都已成为过去。我已经尽我所能远离那个过去，以及曾经那个丑陋不堪的自己。是的，我确实恨那些人，那些把我当作工具而非人的人。那些参与谋杀我母亲的人……SEELE 也在其中，但他们早已不复存在。"

I turn towards the chairman and look him firmly in the eyes. I'm done here, I have nothing more to say, "I have told you all everything I have to tell you. Kaworu is no threat to me, no threat to any of you or this world. If you refuse to believe me then so be it, you can live with your foolish mistake. I'm done here."  
我转向主席，坚定地直视他的眼睛。我在这里已经无话可说，"我已经把所有该说的都告诉你们了。真嗣对我、对你们、对这个世界都没有威胁。如果你们拒绝相信我，那就随你们吧，你们可以承担自己的愚蠢错误。我在这里已经无话可说了。"

### Chapter 18: Waiting To Happen  
第十八章：等待发生  

**Tokyo 2 – UN Embassy – Shinji Ikari  
东京 2 – 联合国大使馆 – 碇真嗣**

My hand tightly grips the sides of the porcelain sink as I try to steady myself. I look up into the mirror and see my pale and shabby reflection looking back at me, I look vastly different to the person I was this morning. My suit is slightly more disheveled, my tie taken off and stuffed into my pocket, my jacket open and the top two buttons of my shirt undone.  
我的手紧紧抓住瓷质洗手池的两侧，试图让自己稳定下来。我抬头看向镜子，看到自己苍白而憔悴的倒影回望着我，与我今早的模样大相径庭。我的西装略显凌乱，领带被摘下塞进口袋，外套敞开，衬衫最上面的两颗扣子也解开了。

I turn the cold tap on and lean in to splash more cold water onto my face. I rushed here immediately after that meeting. It was like some sort of trigger, the moment my feet reached the waiting room and that door closed behind me I felt the wave of nausea rush over me. My stomach clenched and I thought I was going to throw up.  
我打开冷水龙头，俯身将更多冷水泼在脸上。会议一结束，我就急忙赶到了这里。那一刻，仿佛触发了某种开关，当我踏入等候室，门在身后关闭时，一阵恶心感如潮水般涌来。我的胃紧缩着，感觉自己快要吐了。

I'm still not sure if I'm going to. I feel slightly better now, only slightly, after taking these 5-10 minutes to cool myself down but I don't want to leave the room just in case. It was all just too much for me, the heat of the room got to me followed by all the things they were saying and the pressure put on me. It was all too much.  
我仍然不确定自己是否会吐。现在感觉稍微好了一点，只是稍微，经过这 5 到 10 分钟的冷静，但我不想冒险离开房间。这一切对我来说太过沉重，房间的闷热、他们说的话以及施加在我身上的压力，一切都太过分了。

I look at my face again, beads of sweat and water trickling down. My eyes look tired, I'm exhausted and it's not even halfway through the day yet. They... They did this, one meeting did this to me, I have a whole new respect for people like Misato and Fuyutsuki who interact with these sorts of people all the time.  
我再次看着镜子中的自己，汗水和水珠顺着脸颊滑落。我的眼睛显得疲惫，我感到精疲力尽，而这一天甚至还没过半。他们……他们让我如此，仅仅一次会议就让我这样，我对像美里和冬月这样经常与这类人打交道的人有了全新的敬意。

Events from the meeting roll through my mind, the questioning of me, of Kaworu, of my sexuality and then of course Tokita telling me about Asuka and Kaworu. My heart sinks when I think of the two of them together. I didn't... I never thought... No... It doesn't matter.  
会议上的种种情景在我脑海中翻滚，对我的质问，对薰的质问，对我的性取向的质疑，当然还有时田告诉我关于明日香和薰的事情。想到他们俩在一起，我的心沉了下去。我没想到...我从未想过...不...这无关紧要。

I breathe deeply a couple more times, trying to clear my mind and steady my trembling hands. I lift them from the sides of the sink and start to make my way towards the exit of the bathroom. I think... I think I'll be alright now. I'll get myself a bottle of water and go home. I'll sleep, I don't want to do anything else but sleep.  
我又深呼吸了几次，试图清空思绪，稳住颤抖的双手。我从洗手池边抬起手，开始向洗手间出口走去。我想...我想我现在会没事的。我会给自己拿瓶水然后回家。我只想睡觉，除了睡觉我什么都不想做。

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

I'm barely three steps out of the bathroom before I hear a loud voice calling my name. I turn towards its source and see a worries Misato rushing towards me. I prepare myself but thankfully she slows down moments before colliding with me, she pulls me into a warm and gentle hug. I don't resist it, instead I allow myself to melt into her and bring my arms up around her back. I bury my face into her shoulder.  
我才走出洗手间不到三步，就听到一个响亮的声音在叫我的名字。我转向声音的来源，看到忧心忡忡的美里正向我冲来。我做好了准备，但幸运的是她在撞上我之前放慢了速度，她温柔地将我拥入怀中。我没有抗拒，反而让自己融入她的怀抱，抬起双臂环绕她的背部。我将脸埋在她的肩上。

"Oh Shinji, are you okay?"  
"哦，真嗣，你还好吗？"

It starts, I was keeping it together until now but her being her like this and doing this, it starts it. I shake my head and pull Misato tighter to me. I can't stop it from happening, I promised myself I wouldn't cry here, I'm supposed to be an adult but I can't help it. The tears well up in my eyes and I let out a muffled sob into her shoulder as she calmly strokes my back.  
事情就这样开始了，我一直努力保持镇定，直到现在，但她这样子，这样做，它就开始了。我摇摇头，把美里抱得更紧。我无法阻止它发生，我曾对自己承诺不会在这里哭泣，我应该是个成年人了，但我忍不住。泪水涌上眼眶，我将一声压抑的呜咽埋进她的肩膀，她平静地抚摸着我的背。

"Shinji I... I saw everything! I had no idea, I'm so sorry."  
"真嗣，我……我看到了一切！我毫不知情，真的很抱歉。"

Again, I say nothing, just allowing myself to remain in her warmth for a few more moments. I let myself get some of that emotion inside of me out. When I finally do pull away from her I find myself face to face with her worried eyes. She has a small smile on her face and reaches into her handbag to pull out a small tissue for me to use.  
我又一次保持沉默，只是让自己在她温暖的怀抱中多停留片刻。我让自己释放了一些内心的情感。当我最终从她怀中抽身时，发现自己正与她担忧的眼神相对。她脸上带着淡淡的微笑，伸手从手提包里拿出一张小纸巾递给我。

I mumble and embarrassed thank you as I gaze from the watch patch my tears have made on her suit jacket back to her. I begin to wipe my eyes and she guides me towards a seat and sits me down. We remain still, her hand on mine, gently squeezing it for comfort. It takes another minute before I feel I can actually speak again.  
我含糊地道了声谢，带着几分尴尬，目光从她西装外套上我泪水留下的痕迹移回到她脸上。我开始擦拭眼睛，她引导我走向一个座位并让我坐下。我们静静地坐着，她的手放在我的手上，轻轻地握着以示安慰。又过了一分钟，我才感觉自己能再次开口说话。

"Y-You... s-saw everything?" I stutter out, my body still trembling slightly. I haven't been like this in a while, I guess being there, trying to be that strong person for that amount of time had a bigger toll on me than I expected.  
“你……你看到了全部？”我结结巴巴地说，身体仍微微颤抖。我已经有一段时间没有这样了，我想，在那里试图长时间扮演坚强的人，比我预想的要耗费更多心力。

Misato simply nods but I see anger in her eyes, "Yeah, they hooked up a video feed for me and Rei to watch it on. I think Fuyutsuki was watching it in Germany as well. I... I'm sorry you had to go through any of that, I can't imagine how tough it must have been."  
美里只是点了点头，但我从她的眼中看到了愤怒，“是的，他们为我跟绫波接通了视频，让我们观看。我想副司令在德国也看了。我……我很抱歉你经历了这些，我无法想象那有多艰难。”

I let out a small laugh, "You... You dealt with helping us and sorting out NERV after Third Impact. You spoke for us, you must have some idea."  
我轻声笑了出来，“你……你既要帮助我们，又要处理第三冲击后的 NERV。你为我们发声，你肯定有所体会。”

She smiles again, "True but... In not one of those meetings did I... Well In none of them was my personal life questioned..."  
她再次微笑，“确实如此，但……在那些会议中，我的……个人生活从未被质疑过……”

She pauses for a moment, "Okay well... they did have questions! I just... it was different. I was... I was prepared for it, the questions they had were the faults I already knew about myself. My drinking, my neglect of the pilots and my actions. I didn't... find out the person I loved was with another. What Tokita said and did... it was below the belt Shinji."  
她顿了顿，“好吧……他们确实有疑问！我只是……情况不同。我……我对此有所准备，他们提出的问题都是我已知的自身缺陷。我的酗酒，我对飞行员的疏忽，以及我的行为。我并没有……发现我所爱的人和别人在一起。富田说的和做的……真是过分了，真嗣。”

I look up at the wall opposite us as I try to go back through the meeting. It all seems like a blur but Tokita does stand out for me. From the very start of the meeting through to the end he seemed to have it in for me. Not only that but he seemed to actually enjoy my discomfort when he told me about Asuka and Kaworu. What did I ever do to him? Why was he like that?  
我抬头看向对面的墙壁，试图回忆会议的经过。一切都显得模糊不清，但富田确实给我留下了深刻印象。从会议开始到结束，他似乎一直针对我。不仅如此，他似乎还乐见我因他透露明日香和薰的事情而感到不适。我到底对他做了什么？他为何如此？

"Who... is that guy?" I ask Misato, "I mean... I know he is the Japanese representative on the council but... why did he hate me?"  
“那家伙……是谁？”我向美里问道，“我是说……我知道他是理事会中的日本代表，但……他为何如此讨厌我？”

"By all accounts he is an unpleasant man to anyone who comes across him but... there is some history there." She begins to explain, "I've only dealt with him once before, a long time ago before he got himself involved with these sorts of politics."  
"无论从哪个角度看，他都是一个让人不愉快的人，但...他们之间有些过往。" 她开始解释，"我只和他打过一次交道，是很久以前的事了，那时他还没卷入这些政治纷争。"

"When?" I ask. "什么时候的事？" 我问道。

"Do you remember the Jet Alone project?" She asks me, "It was around the time you first started living with me, you would not have met him but I did. I didn't recognize him at first to be honest but then certain things started to fall into place."  
"你还记得 Jet Alone 项目吗？" 她问我，"那是在你刚搬来和我一起住的时候，你没见过他，但我见过。说实话，一开始我没认出他，但后来一些事情逐渐明朗起来。"

I cast my mind back as best as I can before nodding, "Yeah... that was the big robot thing, right?"  
我尽力回忆，然后点头，“嗯...那就是那个大机器人，对吧？”

I can remember it pretty clearly. It wasn't long after I had started living in Tokyo-3. It was after me and Rei had beaten the fifth Angel, Misato had to go on a business trip for it. At the time I was frustrated with her, I thought she was lazy and a slob and I think to be fair she was. I thought I hated it but in a way, she was showing me a reflection of the real her, that she thought of me as family she would let me see that side of her she wouldn't show others.  
我记得很清楚。那是在我开始住在第三新东京市不久后的事。我和绫波击败了第五使徒后，美里不得不为此出差。当时我对她很恼火，觉得她懒惰邋遢，公平地说，她的确如此。我以为我讨厌这样，但从某种程度上，她是在向我展示真实的自己，她把我当作家人，愿意让我看到她不向别人展示的那一面。

It was still frustrating though. The 'real her' could still have learned to clean up after themselves.  
尽管如此，这依然令人沮丧。‘真实的她’本可以学会收拾自己的东西。

Misato nods again, "It was. The Jet Alone was supposed to be an alternative to the Evangelion. It was supposed to be better and more capable than the Eva's. Internal nuclear power and piloted by an onboard computer or remotely. It was an expensive recipe for disaster. As you saw it all went wrong and Tokita has harbored a grudge against anything NERV related since. He even stuck his nose in efforts to compensate you all!"  
美里再次点头，“确实如此。Jet Alone 本应是 EVA 的替代品。它应该比 EVA 更优秀、更有能力。采用内部核动力，由机载计算机或远程操控。这是一场昂贵的灾难配方。正如你所见，一切都出了问题，而自那以后，土田对任何与 NERV 相关的事物都怀恨在心。他甚至插手试图补偿你们所有人！”

I shake my head, "Why? I mean, it wasn't NERVs fault that his stupid robot fai-"  
我摇摇头，“为什么？我是说，他那愚蠢的机器人失败并不是 NERV 的错——”

As I speak I trail off to see Misato looking somewhat sheepish. She looks at me and shrugs, "Actually... It was. I suspected something had happened after the incident, the timing was too perfect. I found like later that your father with the help of Ritsuko and someone else had arranged to sabotage it. Tokita doesn't know this but... well he suspects it."  
我说话间停了下来，看到美里显得有些尴尬。她看着我，耸了耸肩，“实际上……是我们的错。我怀疑事故发生后有什么事情发生了，时机太完美了。后来我发现，在你的父亲和律子以及其他人的帮助下，他们安排了破坏行动。土田不知道这一点，但他……嗯，他有所怀疑。”

I let out a sigh as Misato puts her arm around my shoulder again. So that explains why Tokita had it out for me during that meeting. He hates me because of what my father did. I suspect because I helped stop the thing he probably blames me for it. Just another thing my father did that I'm paying for.  
我叹了口气，Misato 再次将手臂搭在我的肩上。难怪 Tokita 在那次会议上对我怀恨在心。他恨我是因为我父亲所做的事。我怀疑是因为我帮助阻止了他可能因此而责怪我的事情。只是我父亲所做的另一件事，我却在为此付出代价。

My mind turns to the things he said and I look up at Misato, "Was... what he said about Asuka and Kaworu true?"  
我的思绪转向他所说的话，我抬头看着 Misato，"他说的关于 Asuka 和 Kaworu 的事情是真的吗？"

Misato nods again and sighs, "Yes... I asked Rei and she confirmed it. She felt... really bad about not telling you but I told her she shouldn't."  
Misato 再次点头并叹息道，"是的...我问过 Rei，她证实了这一点。她感到...真的很糟糕，没有告诉你，但我告诉她不应该这么做。"

Misato pauses, "That was... something I wanted to talk to you about actually. You... like the two of them, don't you?"  
美里停顿了一下，“那件事……其实是我想和你谈谈的。你……喜欢他们两个，对吧？”

There is no teasing in her voice like there usually is when she asks questions about my love life. She is seriously, scarily serious.  
她的语气中没有平时问及我感情生活时的那种戏谑。她是认真的，认真得让人害怕。

"Yeah... I do..." “嗯……是的……”

"I see..." She pauses again, "So... are you mad at them for this."  
"我明白了..." 她再次停顿，"那么... 你是因为这个生他们的气吗？"

I shake my head, "No... I'm not mad... how can I be? They met and became friends I... I can't be mad at them for that. It... It does hurt but... it's been years since I saw Asuka and even more since I saw Kaworu. I don't have a right to be in a relationship with any of them."  
我摇摇头，"不... 我没有生气... 我怎么能生气呢？他们相遇并成为了朋友，我... 我不能因此对他们生气。这... 这确实让我感到痛苦，但... 自从我见到明日香已经过去很多年了，而见到渚薰的时间更久。我没有权利与他们中的任何一个保持关系。"

Misato's arm tightens around me, "You're much more mature than I would have been, I'd probably be sinking my seventh can of beer around now and smashed up the coffee table as well."  
美里紧紧搂住我，"你比我成熟多了，换作是我，现在可能已经喝下第七罐啤酒，还把咖啡桌给砸了。"

I laugh, "I don't like beer and besides... that was an expensive coffee table."  
我笑着说，“我不喜欢啤酒，而且……那可是张昂贵的咖啡桌。”

It does hurt, it really hurts but mad? I can't be mad at them. I don't want to be mad at them. I want to do the right thing. I'm not... I'm not him. I'm not going to let my jealousy or sadness ruin other people's lives.  
确实很痛，真的很痛，但生气吗？我不能对他们生气。我不想对他们生气。我想做正确的事。我不是……我不是他。我不会让我的嫉妒或悲伤毁了别人的生活。

I look to Misato, "Do you think I did the right thing today?"  
我看向美里，“你觉得我今天做得对吗？”

Misato looks to be lost in thought for a moment. I know this must be quite hard for her as well. I know how she felt about Kaworu. She didn't like the thought of him returning, I don't think she believed he was human either but... she supported me. After a few moments she turns to look me in the eyes, "Did you... truly believe those things you said about him? That he wasn't a threat? That he was human?"  
美里似乎陷入了沉思。我知道这对她来说也一定很难。我了解她对渚的感情。她不喜欢他回来的想法，我想她也不认为他是人类……但她支持我。过了一会儿，她转过来看着我的眼睛，“你……真的相信你说的那些关于他的话吗？他不是威胁？他是人类？”

I nod, "Y-Yeah... I did."  
我点头，“嗯……是的，我相信。”

Then... Yes, you did the right thing." She answers, "You could have walked away at any moment. Even when Tokita told you about the two of them you could have easily walked away from it. You could have said you changed your mind or you were unsure but you continued and did what was right. You did the right thing Shinji, I'm... proud of you for that and you should be proud of yourself."  
“那么……是的，你做对了。”她回答，“你本可以在任何时候离开。即使当时富田告诉你他们两人的事，你也可以轻易地走开。你可以说你改变了主意或你不确定，但你继续前进并做了正确的事。你做得对，真嗣，我……为你感到骄傲，你也应该为自己感到骄傲。”

Pride? It's funny that every time someone tells me I should have pride in myself or they're proud of me it also seems to coincide with a time I feel like I'm being torn apart. I don't feel anything but an aching in my heart right now and a strong desire to go home. Fortunately, it looks like Misato also shares that desire, "I think we should go now. I'll get us some ice cream on the way home to make you feel better!"  
骄傲？真有意思，每次有人告诉我应该为自己感到骄傲，或者他们为我感到骄傲时，似乎都恰好是我感觉自己被撕裂的时刻。我现在只感到心在隐隐作痛，强烈地想回家。幸运的是，美里似乎也有同样的想法，“我想我们现在应该走了。回家路上我会给咱们买些冰淇淋，让你感觉好些！”

I look at her for a moment and fight an urge to shake my head. Ice cream? Is she serious? She is grinning at me, she is serious. I let out a sigh, "Misato I'm not a child... Yeah, Okay... Chocolate chip for me."  
我看了她一会儿，强忍住摇头的冲动。冰淇淋？她是认真的吗？她正对着我咧嘴笑，她是认真的。我叹了口气，“美里，我不是小孩子了……好吧，行吧……我要巧克力碎的。”

**Berlin – UN Embassy Exterior – Asuka Langley Soryu  
柏林 – 联合国大使馆外 – 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I wind my foot back and line it up before letting it fly forward. I immediately regret my action as my foot makes contact with the solid steel of the skip. A loud bang echoes through the alleyway as shake my shoe off and grab my throbbing foot. Those shoes aren't made for kicking things and those skips are not made to be kicked. I'm not going to give the stupid thing the satisfaction of hearing me scream out in pain.  
我收回脚，瞄准目标后猛地踢出。脚一碰到坚硬的钢制垃圾箱，我立刻后悔了。小巷中回荡着一声巨响，我甩掉鞋子，抓住疼痛不已的脚。这些鞋子不适合踢东西，而这些垃圾箱也不是用来踢的。我不会让那愚蠢的东西听到我因疼痛而尖叫。

Instead I bring my foot back again. I know it's a stupid thing to do but I do it anyway and another loud thud is as foot meets steel. This time I reel back as intense, white hot pain shoots through my foot and lower leg. I lean back against a wall feeling a wave of nausea rush over me.  
相反，我又一次把脚收了回来。我知道这么做很蠢，但还是做了，又一声沉重的撞击声响起，脚再次碰到钢板。这次我痛得后退，强烈的、灼热的疼痛从脚部直窜小腿。我靠在墙上，一阵恶心感涌上心头。

"D-Did things not go so well?"  
“事情……进展得不顺利吗？”

I turn my head at the sound of the meek voice and see Kaworu stood at the entrance of the alleyway. He is looking at me like a lost puppy might look at its owner. His head is slightly tilted and his face showing his concern. I tenderly rub my foot as another feeling comes over me, dread at what I am going to say to him.  
我听到那微弱的声音转过头去，看到渚薰站在巷子口。他看着我，就像一只迷路的小狗看着主人一样。他的头微微倾斜，脸上流露出关切。我轻轻揉着脚，另一种感觉涌上心头，对即将对他说的话感到恐惧。

I fucked it up, didn't I? I fucked everything up! Stupid. Fucking. Me!  
我搞砸了，对吧？我把一切都搞砸了！愚蠢。该死的。我！

What the hell did I expect to happen? Of course, I was going to fuck it up! That's what Asuka Langley Soryu does! She goes in, fucks it up and fucks off. I don't even think the invincible Shinji can save the situation now.  
我到底期待会发生什么？当然，我会搞砸一切！这就是惣流·明日香·兰格雷的作风！她闯进去，搞砸一切然后离开。我甚至不认为无敌的真嗣现在能挽救局面了。

So now I'm left to explain the damn thing to Kaworu, the very person I was trying to help. I have to tell him that I've ruined his life for him.  
现在我只能向渚薰解释这该死的事情，那个我本想帮助的人。我得告诉他，我已经毁了他的生活。

"No!" I hiss at him angrily, "It did not go well!"  
“不！”我生气地对他低声说，“事情没办好！”

I'm about to take aim at the skip once more when he suddenly dashes forward and puts his arms around me. Both saving me from doing more damage to myself and also giving me some meagre and undeserved comfort. I struggle in his arms for a moment to keep my balance, standing with my good foot on the ground, my exposed and dirtied foot hanging precariously over the floor. I'm beyond pathetic.  
我正准备再次瞄准那个跳跃点，他突然冲上前，用双臂抱住我。既救了我免于对自己造成更多伤害，也给了我一些微薄且不应得的安慰。我在他的怀抱中挣扎了一会儿以保持平衡，用我那只完好的脚站立，受伤且沾满尘土的脚危险地悬在地板上。我真是可悲至极。

"i fucked it up Kaworu." I sigh into his shoulder, my eyes stinging with tears, "And... I think I might have broken my foot as well."  
“我把事情搞砸了，渚薰。”我叹息着靠在他的肩上，泪水刺痛了我的眼睛，“而且……我觉得我的脚可能也骨折了。”

Kaworu says nothing, instead he wraps his arms a little bit tighter around me and runs a hand through my hair. He moves to kiss me on the forehead, "You did the best you could have done Asuka. I don't think you have done anything wrong."  
渚薰没有说话，只是将双臂更紧地环绕着我，用手轻抚我的头发。他俯身亲吻我的额头，“你已经尽力了，明日香。我认为你并没有做错什么。”

The best? The best I could have done? If that was my best then my worst must be absolutely dreadful. I pull away and see his face, he is actually smiling at me. Kaworu is smiling at me with that stupid, cute, perfect smile of his! Does he not understand what I just said? Did the idiot not hear me properly? How can be smiling.  
尽力？我尽力了？如果那是我最好的表现，那我最糟糕的时候该有多可怕。我挣脱开，看到他的脸，他竟然在对我微笑。渚薰用他那愚蠢、可爱、完美的笑容对着我微笑！他难道不明白我刚才说的话吗？这个傻瓜难道没听清楚吗？他怎么能笑得出来。

"Kaworu you... you don't understand... I... fucked this up." I try to tell him, "It wasn't them... It was me... I couldn't keep control. I lost my temper with them, I let them get to me. I didn't even stay to the end of the meeting. I just... stormed out after calling them all fools. I have fucked this up for you."  
"渚薰你...你不明白...我...搞砸了这一切。"我试图告诉他，"不是他们...是我...我没能控制住自己。我失去了理智，对他们发了脾气，让他们激怒了我。我甚至没等到会议结束。我只是...在骂他们都是傻瓜后愤然离场。我把你这事搞砸了。"

Kaworu is still smiling. Is he that stupid or is he just good at hiding disappointment? I wonder if he has even taken something but I know that can't be it. This is just Kaworu, he... he is smiling because he means it. Why is he smiling?  
渚薰依然在微笑。他是真那么蠢，还是擅长隐藏失望？我想知道他是否吃了什么药，但我知道那不可能。这就是渚薰，他...他微笑是因为他真心如此。他为什么在笑？

"Kaworu... Please say something! Aren't you angry or mad at me? This was... your only chance and I... I've messed it up for you." My hands grip his shoulders tightly as I plead with him, I'm not even sure what I want right now. Do I want him to be angry? Do I want him to yell at me? I don't want that, I don't want to be told I'm bad but this... this feels worse.  
"渚薰...请说点什么！你不生气或对我失望吗？这可是...你唯一的机会，而我...我把它搞砸了。"我的双手紧紧抓住他的肩膀恳求他，我甚至不确定我现在想要什么。我希望他生气吗？我希望他对我大吼大叫吗？我不希望那样，我不想被说成是坏人，但这种感觉...这种感觉更糟。

I pray that no one passes and looks into the alley right now to see how ridiculous this scene is. A girl hopping on one foot, nearly crying and gripping onto her smiling boyfriend's shoulders.  
我祈祷此刻无人经过，向这条小巷投来目光，看到这荒唐的一幕。一个女孩单脚跳着，几乎要哭出来，紧紧抓着她那微笑着的男友的肩膀。

"Asuka I... I could never be angry or mad at you for what you did or didn't do." He finally replies, "i love you Asuka and the fact that you even tried to do this is enough for me. Regardless of what they say today, whether I am allowed to travel or not I am happy because... you tried. You have no idea how grateful I am to both yourself and Shinji for this. I am... at peace with the idea that things might not go our way because... at least I have your love. That means more to me than anything else."  
“明日香，我……我永远不会因为你做了或没做什么而对你生气或愤怒。”他终于回答道，“我爱你，明日香，你甚至尝试去做这件事，对我来说已经足够了。无论今天他们怎么说，无论我是否被允许旅行，我都很高兴，因为……你尝试了。你不知道我对你和真嗣有多感激。我……对事情可能不会如我们所愿感到平静，因为……至少我有你的爱。这对我来说比什么都重要。”

I look at him for a moment, tears still burning in my eyes from the pain in my foot and the emotion of his words. Kaworu does... truly love me but why? I'm a mess, look at me right now. I'm pathetic, begging for him to be angry at me because I can't accept that I might be a good person.  
我凝视着他，泪水仍因脚上的疼痛和他说的话而灼热。渚薰……真的爱我，但为什么呢？我一团糟，看看我现在这副样子。我可悲，乞求他对我发怒，因为我无法接受自己可能是个好人。

I look him in the eyes, does he mean what he said? Does he truly mean it? Yes, of course he does. Of course, he means it because for some reason he actually loves me. Despite me not deserving it and being a failure this strange but wonderful guy actually loves me.  
我直视他的眼睛，他说的都是真心话吗？他真的这么想吗？是的，当然是的。他当然这么想，因为出于某种原因，他真的爱我。尽管我不配得到这份爱，尽管我是个失败者，这个奇怪却美妙的家伙真的爱我。

"Can we go now?" I mumble, keeping my hands on his shoulders for support and biting back the tears.  
“我们现在可以走了吗？”我咕哝着，双手搭在他的肩膀上寻求支撑，强忍着泪水。

"Of course." he nods and smiles as we turn to leave the alley. He shoots a concerned glance down at my foot, "I think we should do to a hospital first though and get your foot looked at."  
“当然。”他点头微笑，我们转身离开小巷。他关切地低头看了一眼我的脚，“不过，我想我们应该先去医院，看看你的脚。”

"No I..." I shake my head as I start to set my foot back into my shoe. My words fade as my foot makes contact and sends an intense amount of pain up through it and my lower leg. I feel my nails dig into his shoulders as I try to not let out a scream, "Okay, yes... hospital... hospital sounds good just... please don't tell them how I did it."  
“不，我……”我摇着头，开始将脚重新塞进鞋里。话音未落，脚一触地，剧痛便如电流般直窜而上，穿过脚踝和小腿。我指甲紧扣他的肩膀，强忍着不发出尖叫，“好吧，是的……去医院……去医院听起来不错……只是……请别告诉他们我是怎么弄的。”

**Tokyo-2 – Misato's Apartment – Misato Katsuragi  
东京-2 – 美里公寓 – 葛城美里**

I step out of the apartment into the much cooler evening. As the door shuts so to goes the sound of voices and video games. All I am left with now is the ambient sounds of traffic nearby and the noise of a couple of kids still out playing in the courtyard below.  
我走出公寓，步入凉爽的夜晚。随着门的关闭，人声和电子游戏的喧闹也随之消失。现在，我耳边只剩下附近车辆的嘈杂声和楼下庭院里几个孩子仍在玩耍的吵闹声。

Today has been a taxing day for me, but even more so for Shinji in there. He does seem to be a little bit better though. I don't know if it's a brave face because I invited his friends over or if he does genuinely feel better. It's hard to tell with people, especially him.  
今天对我来说已经很疲惫了，但对里面的真嗣来说更是如此。不过，他似乎确实感觉好了一点。我不知道这是因为他朋友们来访时我鼓励他展现的勇敢面孔，还是他真的感觉好些了。人的情绪很难捉摸，尤其是他。

I feel so bad for Shinji, I really do. I can't pretend I know how he feels or what he is going through. I've had my heartbroken before, and I'm sure I've broken hearts. Generally, I'm the one doing the breaking up or just denying them. It all started with Kaji many years ago and... well there haven't exactly been a rush of men since but... it's all the same thing, right?  
我对真嗣感到非常抱歉，真的。我不能假装我知道他的感受或他正在经历什么。我以前也心碎过，当然我也肯定伤过别人的心。通常，我是那个提出分手或直接拒绝他们的人。这一切都始于多年前与加持的恋情，然后……好吧，之后并没有太多男人涌入我的生活，但……都是同样的事情，对吧？

I know Shinji loved her and I was so certain she loved him back. Still, five years is a long time and life isn't a fairytale like we'd sometimes like it to be. If it was then... well Kaji wouldn't be dead. This is just something that Shinji will have to get over, it'll be tough but he is still young and there are plenty more fish in the sea as they say.  
我知道真嗣深爱着她，我也曾确信她同样爱着他。然而，五年是很长的时间，生活并不总是像我们有时希望的那样如童话般美好。如果真是那样的话……好吧，加持就不会死了。这只是真嗣必须克服的事情，虽然会很艰难，但他还年轻，正如人们所说，海里还有很多鱼。

I will admit, I was quite shocked when I found out about Asuka and Nagisa being an item. It wasn't something I had expected, obviously I knew that they were friends but romance? I was so sure Kaworu was... well when I look back at how he acted around Shinji... I know he was deceiving Shinji but there are some things you can't hide. Glances, looks and blushes, Kaworu... had all of that.  
我得承认，当我得知明日香和渚在一起时，我相当震惊。这显然不是我预料中的事，虽然我知道他们是朋友，但恋情？我一直以为薰会是……好吧，回想他对待真嗣的方式……我知道他在欺骗真嗣，但有些东西是藏不住的。眼神、表情和脸红，薰……这些他都有。

I suppose when I think about it I don't really know who Kaworu is. All I know is what I think he is or at least what I knew he was. I met him for a such a small amount of time, Asuka has known him for months now. I will say this... if he ever hurts her then he will have me to deal with.  
我想，仔细想想，我其实并不真正了解薰。我所知道的只是我认为的他，或者至少是我所了解的他。我和他相处的时间如此短暂，而明日香已经认识他几个月了。我要说的是……如果他伤害了她，那他就要面对我。

I let out a sigh, the person I'm out here to meet should be along in a moment. I hope he is bringing good news with him. I look towards the elevator, right on cue in opens up and Fuyutsuki steps out giving me a nod of acknowledgement.  
我叹了口气，我要见的那个人应该马上就到了。希望他带来的是好消息。我朝电梯望去，准时地，电梯门打开了，冬月走了出来，向我点头示意。

"Katsuragi." "葛城。"

I nod back politely, "Fuyutsuki."  
我礼貌地点头回应，"冬月。"

"I take it Shinji is inside, how is he doing?"  
"看来真嗣在里面，他怎么样了？"

"Better." I reply, "He's got some friends with him, he seems happier but today did take a toll on him."  
"好多了。" 我回答，"他有些朋友陪着，看起来更开心了，但今天确实对他影响不小。"

"Yes... I can imagine." The older man bows his head, he looks troubled and I wonder if maybe he has heard something already. My mind starts firing questions but I remain silent, it's best to not say anything yet. I wait for him to finish, "They allowed me to observe it from my office here in Tokyo-2."  
"是的……我能想象。" 年长者低下头，显得心事重重，我不禁猜测他是否已经听到了什么风声。脑海中涌现出无数疑问，但我保持沉默，现在最好还是不要多言。我等待着他继续，"他们允许我从东京-2 的办公室里观察这一切。"

"I see, so you saw the whole thing then?" I ask him as my attention turns back to the now empty courtyard. I'm aware of the frosty nature of my tone, I'm always on my guard when around the old man. I know I have no reason to be but despite all his changes and how much he has helped I still can't find it within myself to completely forgive him for his role in all that happened.  
"我明白了，那你当时看到了整个过程？" 我问道，目光再次转向如今空无一人的庭院。我意识到自己语气中的冷淡，与这位老人相处时我总是保持警惕。我知道自己没有理由这样，尽管他已有所改变，且给予了许多帮助，但我仍无法完全原谅他在这一切中所扮演的角色。

"Indeed." He stands next to me and places a hand on the railing also looking into the courtyard below, "Shinji handled himself very well in there. I don't think there are many who would be able to hold their own against a group of professional politicians like that. He came across very well, almost unflappable he reminded me of..."  
“确实。”他站在我旁边，也将手放在栏杆上，一同望向下方庭院，“真嗣在里面表现得非常出色。我认为很少有人能在那样一群职业政客面前保持镇定。他显得非常从容，几乎不动声色，让我想起了……”

"His father?" I finish the sentence for him, "I don't think that's a comparison Shinji would appreciate."  
“他的父亲？”我替他说完这句话，“我觉得真嗣不会喜欢这种比较。”

I scowl but also have to admit that Fuyutsuki was right. If it wasn't for who Shinji's father was it might have been amusing, the body language, the stare and the way he spoke. It was all shades of his father. For some that would be a compliment but for Shinji it'd be the worst thing he could hear.  
我皱眉，但也得承认冬月说得没错。如果不是因为真嗣的父亲，这种比较或许还有点趣味，无论是肢体语言、眼神还是说话方式，都像极了他父亲。对某些人来说，这可能是种赞美，但对真嗣而言，却是最不想听到的话。

"Of course not, it was just the musings of a foolish old man." Fuyutsuki answers "I apologize I did not mean to compare the two, it is just I..."  
"当然不是，那只是一个愚蠢老人的胡思乱想。" 冬月回答道，"我道歉，无意将两者相提并论，只是我……"

"No, I know..." I cut him off sharply, "I could see it too but... Shinji is thankfully nothing like that man. Shinji fights for others and not for himself. Shinji would rather put himself on the line even if it hurts him dearly to help someone else."  
"不，我知道……" 我尖锐地打断他，"我也能看出来，但是……幸好真嗣和那个人完全不同。真嗣是为了他人而战，不是为了自己。真嗣宁愿自己承担风险，哪怕这会让他深受伤害，也要去帮助别人。"

"I know." He nods, "He is so much more like his mother in that regard. She too would not wish to hurt another in what she did, she too wanted to fight for and help others. She would always try to look for the good in someone."  
"我明白。" 他点头，"在这方面，他更像他的母亲。她也不希望因自己的行为伤害他人，她也想为他人而战、帮助他人。她总是试图在别人身上寻找优点。"

"Still." He looks at me, "I am sure you do not wish to hear me ramble about Shinji's parents. I wanted to meet with you because I have some news regarding today's events. I thought you might like to hear it."  
"还是。" 他看着我，"我确信你不想听我唠叨关于真嗣的父母。我找你是想告诉你一些关于今天事件的消息。我想你可能会想听。"

"Go ahead." I nod back.  
"说吧。" 我点头回应。"

"The good news is that the committee were very impressed with Shinji today, at least most of them were." Fuyutsuki takes a moment to pause, "Tokita cast his vote immediately after the meeting."  
"好消息是，委员会对真嗣今天的表现在很大程度上印象深刻，至少大部分人是这样。" 冬月停顿了一下，"土田在会议结束后立即投了他的票。"

"Will that impact the discussions?" I ask him.  
"那会影响讨论吗？" 我问他。

He shakes his head, "No, they do not need to be unanimous in their decision. Still many of them are taking the time to re-evaluate their prior decision. All, with the exception of Tokita, are discussing the situation and re-examining all the data they have on Nagisa."  
他摇摇头，"不，他们不需要达成一致决定。尽管如此，他们中的许多人还是在重新评估之前的决定。除了时田之外，所有人都在讨论这个情况，并重新审视他们所掌握的关于渚的所有数据。"

"I see, so Tokita has taken himself out of the talks."  
"我明白了，所以时田已经退出讨论了。"

"I'm not sure." Fuyutsuki replies, "I think it is more a matter of them taking him out of the talks. His views are clear, no evidence or discussion will sway him, so what is the point of him being a part of it."  
"我不确定。" 冬月回答，"我认为更多的是他们想把他排除在谈判之外。他的观点很明确，任何证据或讨论都无法动摇他，所以让他参与其中有什么意义呢。"

"Do they not think he could have a valid point hidden under all that malice?" I ask.  
"难道他们不认为他那些恶意之下可能隐藏着合理的观点吗？" 我问道。

"Perhaps." Fuyutsuki taps his finger off of the balcony, "Do you think he has a point?"  
"或许吧。" 冬月用手指轻敲着阳台，"你觉得他有道理吗？"

"I..." I look away for a moment, what do my feelings on Nagisa matter? I am not a part of the discussion, if Shinji supports Nagisa then I will support Shinji, "I haven't thought about it but... Nagisa was an Angel. His actions did threaten our world. Out of all of them he came the closest to ending it all but he stopped himself."  
"我..." 我一时移开视线，我对渚的感情又有什么关系呢？我不是讨论的一部分，如果真嗣支持渚，那我也会支持真嗣，"我还没想过这个问题，但...渚曾是使徒。他的行为确实威胁到了我们的世界。在所有使徒中，他最接近终结一切，但他自己停手了。"

"Still... He hurt Shinji by doing that and... a part of me hates him for that but it's not like I didn't play my part in hurting Shinji either." I look up towards the evening sky, "I don't believe Nagisa is a threat. Shinji saying it is good enough to me but...that and my own feeling aside I've seen the evidence. I've seen the medical reports and he's as human as me or you."  
"尽管如此...他那样做伤害了真嗣，而且...我的一部分因此恨他，但也不代表我没有伤害过真嗣。" 我抬头望向傍晚的天空，"我不认为渚是个威胁。真嗣这么说对我来说就足够了，但...抛开这些和我自己的感觉，我看过证据。我看过医疗报告，他和我们一样是人类。"

Fuyutsuki nods and I think for a moment I see the old man smile, "I'm glad you of all people think so."  
冬月点头，我一时觉得这位老人似乎笑了，"我很高兴你这么想。"

"Can I ask... why are you so keen to help him? You didn't know Nagisa, you didn't owe him anything and yet you seem so keen to help him."  
"我能问一下...你为什么这么热心帮助他吗？你不认识渚，也不欠他什么，但你似乎非常愿意帮助他。"

"Because he deserves a life, just like any of us do." Fuyutsuki answers me, "Because he deserves better than to be defined by the legacy of his past masters. Nagisa is unlike me or many others. He was not given a choice in what he is or was, he was born for a purpose and raised solely for that purpose. He was no different to Rei in that regard."  
"因为他应该拥有生活，就像我们任何人一样。" 副校长回答我，"因为他不应该被过去主人的遗产所定义。渚和我或许多人不同。他没有选择自己是什么或曾经是什么，他生来就有目的，只为那个目的而培养。在这方面，他和丽没有什么不同。"

"Rei was different though."  
"但丽是不同的。"

Fuyutsuki shakes his head, "Rei was different due to exposure to people like Shinji and yourself. through those interactions she was able to change and grow slightly putting her on a different course to Nagisa. Had Nagisa had the opportunity to live like Rei did then perhaps he would have changed too."  
冬月摇了摇头，“零是因为接触了像真嗣和你这样的人，才有所不同。通过这些互动，她得以稍稍改变和成长，走上了与渚不同的道路。如果渚有机会像零那样生活，也许他也会改变。”

"From what I saw Rei didn't have much of a life." I reply darkly.  
“据我所见，零的生活并不丰富。”我阴沉地回答。

"I know..." He bows his head, "Rei's upbringing is something I regret but Ikari had his reasons. Still he allowed her to attend school and interact with others. In a way it is those interactions that led to his failure."  
“我知道……”他低下头，“零的成长环境是我所遗憾的，但碇有他的理由。尽管如此，他还是让她上学并与人交往。某种程度上，正是这些互动导致了他的失败。”

"Rei betrayed him in the end."  
"最终，丽背叛了他。"

"Yes, she did." Fuyutsuki nods, "Perhaps Nagisa would have done the same but SEELE kept him on a tight leash. He had no life, he was raised to die and had I not stepped in the UN were content to imprison him and pin the sins of his masters on him. I could not allow that to happen. Raised to die, be given a second chance and then left to die."  
"是的，她确实背叛了他。" 冬月点头道，"或许渚也会做出同样的选择，但 SEELE 将他牢牢控制。他没有生活，从小被培养成牺牲品，如果不是我介入，联合国本打算将他囚禁，并把其主人的罪行归咎于他。我不能允许这种事发生。从小被培养成牺牲品，给予第二次机会后又被抛弃。"

I nod and I think I understand a little bit more now. I think about how unfair that would have been. I know Rei has struggled over the years to come to terms with her role in what happened. She and Nagisa... they aren't too dissimilar.  
我点头，现在似乎更理解了一些。我想象那该有多么不公。我知道丽这些年来一直在努力接受自己在所发生事件中的角色。她和渚... 他们其实颇为相似。

"Gendo and SEELE... they ruined a lot of lives, didn't they?" I muse.  
"源堂和 SEELE...他们毁掉了许多生命，不是吗？" 我沉思道。

"I played my part in that willingly." Fuyutsuki answers, "That is why I try to make up for it today but I do not wish to see those children take the blame for the sins of those that came before. That is why I am helping Nagisa and that is why I try to help the others."  
"我曾自愿参与其中。" 冬月回答，"这就是为什么我今天努力弥补，但我不想看到那些孩子们为前人的罪行承担责任。这就是我帮助渚的原因，也是我试图帮助其他人的原因。"

I nod, "Do you think they will ever return?"  
我点头，"你认为他们会回来吗？"

Fuyutsuki shakes his head, "No, I do not. In a way I feel it is for the best, whilst it feels the people who orchestrated it all did get away with it the circus of a return of either of them would risk upsetting the way the world is. Who would put them on trial? How would they be tried? People would demand blood and then... you also have the section of people who view them as saviors."  
冬月摇了摇头，“不，我不这么认为。某种程度上，我觉得这样最好，尽管策划这一切的人似乎逃脱了惩罚，但他们的回归可能会引发一场风波，扰乱世界的现状。谁会审判他们？他们将如何受审？人们会要求血债血偿，然后……还有一部分人视他们为救世主。”

"Saviors?" I scoff, "Really?"  
“救世主？”我嗤之以鼻，“真的吗？”

"They are out there, loose scattered groups who think Instrumentality was mankind's salvation. It seems crazy to think of but if one of their adopted saviors returns then it gives them something to latch onto, it gives them a potential voice it..." He shakes his head, "Perhaps I am overthinking things."  
“确实存在，散落各地的团体认为人类补完计划是人类的救赎。这听起来很疯狂，但如果他们拥戴的救世主之一回归，那就会给他们一个依附的对象，赋予他们潜在的声音……”他摇了摇头，“或许我想得太多了。”

"Perhaps. but maybe you're right, not just because of the risk of cult uprisings." I chuckle, "We've made a lot of progress, Shinji and Rei have made a lot of progress and if he... if he returned it might be damaging to them... to all of us."  
“或许吧。但也许你是对的，不仅仅是因为邪教起义的风险。”我轻笑，“我们已经取得了很大进展，真嗣和绫波也取得了很大进展，如果他……如果他回来，可能会对他们……对我们所有人造成伤害。”

"Indeed." He looks down at his watch, "I should not take up anymore of your time anyway Katsuragi. Tell Shinji that I should have an answer soon and I will contact him as soon as possible."  
“确实。”他低头看了一眼手表，“无论如何，我也不该再占用你的时间了，葛城。告诉真嗣，我很快就会有答案，我会尽快联系他。”

I nod, "Okay." 我点头，"好的。"

He starts to walk away as I call after him, "What about Asuka, how did things go for her?"  
他开始走开，我追问：“那明日香呢，她的情况如何？”

He stops and looks at me, "There was... something of an incident with Ms Soryu. Tokita felt it would be appropriate to prod a little bit too much into her past."  
他停下来看着我，“索留小姐那儿……发生了一点小插曲。时田觉得过多探究她的过去不太合适。”

"Oh dear..." “哦，天哪……”

"Yes, but despite her reaction to it I do not think their case was hurt in any way."  
“是的，不过尽管她对此有所反应，我认为这并没有对他们的案件造成任何损害。”

I step forward fearing now as to what Asuka might have done. I know the temper Asuka has and if they probed too much then she will have shown them it. She has only allowed a very small number of people glimpses into her past, me, Kaji and Shinji. Tokita must have known this and that's why he tried to goad her.  
我向前迈步，心中忐忑不安，不知明日香可能做了什么。我深知明日香的脾气，如果他们探问过多，她定会让他们见识到。她只允许极少数人窥见她的过去，我、加持和真嗣。富田必定知道这一点，这也是他试图激怒她的原因。

"What... was her reaction?"  
“她……有何反应？”

"An impassioned plea for them to understand that Nagisa was no threat to them before calling them all fools and then walking out of the meeting. It was... mild compared to what she might have done in the past."  
“她先是恳切地请求他们理解渚对他们并无威胁，随后称他们为傻瓜，便离开了会议。这……比起她过去可能的举动，算是温和了。”

"I see... And you don't think it hurt things in any way?"  
"我明白了... 你觉得这没有对事情造成任何伤害吗？"

"Not at all, if anything I think they were impressed by how passionate she was regarding Nagisa." He answers with a smile, "I will now take my leave, I will contact you as soon as I know anything more.  
"一点也没有，相反，我认为他们被她对渚的热情所打动。" 他微笑着回答，"我现在要告辞了，一有新消息我会立刻联系你。"

**Berlin – Hospital – Kaworu Nagisa  
柏林 – 医院 – 渚薰**

I lean back against the wall and smile awkwardly at Asuka as she sits, a scowl on her face, on the edge of the hospital bed. I know she hates being here, there are a number of reasons behind it. Hospitals remind her of an awful moment in her life. I have spoken to her about those moments on a few occasions. Not many, she doesn't open up to me much but she had told me bits and pieces, more so than most people with the exception of Rei and Shinji.  
我靠在墙上，尴尬地对坐在医院床边的明日香笑了笑，她脸上带着不悦的表情。我知道她讨厌来这里，背后有很多原因。医院让她想起了生命中的一个糟糕时刻。我曾几次与她谈及那些时刻，虽然不多，她对我并不太敞开心扉，但她告诉了我一些片段，比大多数人都要多，除了绫波和真嗣。

I know her pride has been wounded significantly by having to come here and also admitting how she did it. It would be one thing if she hurt her foot due to someone else but this was her own fault. She is embarrassed by that and that only serves to make her angrier.  
我知道她的自尊心因不得不来这里以及承认是如何受伤而受到了严重伤害。如果是别人导致她伤了脚，那还好说，但这是她自己的错。她为此感到尴尬，而这只会让她更加愤怒。

She also feels guilty. She feels like she has ruined our chances of reversing the council's decision regarding my ability to travel. I have tried to tell her I would not be bothered if they did uphold their decision. The fact that she even tried means more to me than anything else. I love her and that will not change.  
她还感到内疚。她觉得她破坏了我们逆转委员会关于我旅行能力的决定的机会。我试图告诉她，即使他们维持原判，我也不会介意。她甚至尝试过这件事，对我来说比什么都重要。我爱她，这一点永远不会改变。

My words have done little to help. I understand, sometimes it requires more than words. I have been on that side of it myself. Sometimes it requires a gesture, me holding or kissing her might help. Not really things I can do here but I have a plan. I plan for a night of cuddling on a sofa, ordering pizza and a large quantity of ice cream.  
我的话并未起到多大帮助。我明白，有时仅凭言语是不够的。我自己也曾身处那种境地。有时需要一个动作，比如我抱着她或亲吻她或许会有所帮助。虽然在这里我无法做到这些，但我有个计划。我打算安排一个晚上，在沙发上依偎着，点些披萨和大量冰淇淋。

It is my belief ever since I returned that 99% of human problems can be solved by ice cream. If you are feeling sad then consume some ice cream! If you are too hot, consume some ice cream! If you are too cold, get a warm chocolate pudding and have a scoop of ice cream on top of it. It's that simple.  
自从我回来后，我一直相信 99%的人类问题都可以通过冰淇淋解决。如果你感到悲伤，那就吃些冰淇淋！如果你觉得太热，吃些冰淇淋！如果你觉得太冷，来份热巧克力布丁，再在上面放一勺冰淇淋。就这么简单。

I look towards the clock. It has been hours since we came here and even longer since the meeting. Truthfully, I do not expect them to reverse their decision. I do not think Asuka's actions will have any bearing on it, nor do I think Shinji's will. I just think that the fear those people have of me is too overpowering that they cannot be persuaded otherwise.  
我望向时钟。自从我们来到这里已经过去好几个小时，甚至更久远的会议时间。说实话，我并不指望他们能改变决定。我不认为明日香的行为会对结果有任何影响，也不认为真嗣的举动会有所改变。我只是觉得那些人对我的恐惧太过强烈，以至于无法被说服改变主意。

I am preparing myself for that decision, I will of course be slightly upset and disappointed if it does happen. I did want to see Shinji again, even after all that has happened. I wanted to meet him and see him perform. At the same time, I have to atone for the sins of my past. I know I have been told many times I am not to blame and I do believe that but my actions still hurt people and there must surely be some punishment for that.  
我正在为那个决定做准备，如果真的发生了，我当然会有些难过和失望。尽管发生了那么多事，我还是想再见真嗣一面。我想见他，看他表演。与此同时，我必须为过去的罪行赎罪。我知道很多人告诉我这不是我的错，我也相信这一点，但我的行为确实伤害了人，对此肯定需要某种惩罚。

So, I would not be mad or disappointed with Asuka or Shinji for not succeeding today. It fills me with such a sense of joy that they have even tried to help me. I cannot possibly express to them how it makes me feel that they would try to help me. Especially Shinji, by all rights he should have said no straight away, and yet, he did not.  
所以，我不会因为明日香或真嗣今天没有成功而生气或失望。他们甚至尝试帮助我，这让我感到无比的喜悦。我无法向他们表达，他们愿意尝试帮助我，这让我有多感动。尤其是真嗣，按理说他应该立刻拒绝，但他没有。

Shinji had been hurt by me and yet he still has that sense of selflessness and desire to help. Shinji had been hurt by so many people. He was a soul in such turmoil. He had been abandoned by his father and forced into a life of pain and misery. His friends had left or been hurt and yet there was still some light within him that refused to go out, even if he didn't realize it.  
真嗣曾被我伤害，但他依然保持着无私和助人的愿望。真嗣被许多人伤害过。他是一个处于极度混乱中的灵魂。他被父亲抛弃，被迫过着痛苦和悲惨的生活。他的朋友们离开或受伤，但他内心仍有某种光芒不愿熄灭，即使他自己没有意识到。

He could so easily have gone against a world that seemed to exist only to hurt him but he didn't. He resolved to move forward. I think that is why I found myself so drawn to him when I first met him. I was given a simple task but when I met him I felt something within I hadn't felt before. I know the feeling now, I've felt it and feel it now with Asuka. It is love.  
他本可以轻易地与那个似乎只为伤害他而存在的世界对抗，但他没有。他决心向前迈进。我想这就是为什么我第一次见到他时，会被他深深吸引。我被赋予了一项简单的任务，但当我遇见他时，我内心涌动着一种前所未有的感觉。现在我明白了这种感觉，我已经感受到，并且现在与明日香在一起时依然感受到。那就是爱。

"Where the hell is this doctor!" I hear Asuka suddenly ask, snapping me from my thoughts. These are the first words I've heard from her for at least half an hour, "He said I could be discharged and that it wouldn't take long! So, where the hell is he? I just want to go home!"  
“那个医生到底在哪儿！”我听到明日香突然问道，打断了我的思绪。这是至少半小时以来我第一次听到她说话，“他说我可以出院，而且不会花太长时间！那他到底在哪儿？我只想回家！”

"I am sure he will return soon." I reply to her calmly and smile warmly at her, "He most likely got held up with something else. You know how these places can be."  
“我相信他很快就会回来的。”我平静地回答她，并向她温暖地微笑，“他很可能被其他事情耽搁了。你知道这些地方的情况。”

"No, I don't." She snaps back in annoyance and resumes her scowling. I slowly walk over to her and sit down next to her on the bed.  
"不，我不。" 她恼怒地回了一句，继续皱着眉头。我缓缓走向她，坐在床边。

"How is your foot feeling now?" I nod down at the bandages appendage as she lets out a sigh.  
"你的脚现在感觉如何？" 我朝她包着绷带的脚点了点头，她叹了口气。

"Better but still sore." She replies, "I feel like a goddamn idiot."  
"好些了，但还是疼。" 她回答，"我感觉自己像个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。"

"You were angry, it was an understandable reaction to that." I make some feeble attempt to reassure her.  
"你生气了，面对那种情况这是可以理解的反应。" 我有些无力地试图安慰她。

"Kaworu, kicking a metal skip whilst barefoot is not an 'understandable reaction', it is idiocy." She replies and then sighs again, "I... I'm just sick of me. I try to do the right thing and then just mess it up."  
"薰，光着脚踢金属垃圾桶可不是什么'可以理解的反应'，那是愚蠢。" 她回答后又叹了口气，"我...我只是厌倦了自己。我试着做正确的事，结果却总是搞砸。"

"Asuka... You haven't done anything wrong." I put my arm around her, "I am sure if you had have done we would have heard back by now. Instead we are sti-"  
"明日香...你没做错什么。" 我搂住她，"我相信如果真有什么不对，我们早就收到消息了。相反，我们还在..."

I am suddenly interrupted by the vibration in my pocket and the sound of my ringtone. I pull the phone out of my pocket as Asuka looks at me, "You know you were supposed to turn that off right, they put up enough signs."  
口袋里的震动和铃声突然打断了我。我掏出手机，看着明日香，“你知道你该把它关掉的，对吧？他们已经贴了那么多告示。”

I roll my eyes, "I... forgot."  
我翻了个白眼，“我……忘了。”

I look at the screen, "It's Fuyutsuki! Should I... answer it?"  
我看向屏幕，“是冬月！我该……接吗？”

"Of course, you should you idiot! Hospital rules be damned!" She answers, "let him tell us how I messed everything up!"  
"当然，你这个白痴！管他什么医院规定！" 她回答道，"让他告诉我们我是怎么把一切都搞砸的！"

"Asuka I don't thin-" "明日香，我觉得不——"

"Just answer the goddamn phone Kaworu!" She cuts me off and I immediately accept the call, standing up and walking to my previous location against the wall as I do so.  
"快接电话，卡哇兰！" 她打断了我，我立刻接起电话，站起来走向之前靠墙的位置。

"Hello?" “喂？”

_"Nagisa."_ Fuyutsuki's voice comes through clearly, _"I hope you are well, we had a report that said you and Ms Soryu were near the hospital, is everything okay?"_  
"渚。" 冬月先生的声音清晰传来，"希望你一切安好，我们收到报告说你和副司令在医院附近，一切都还好吗？"

"Ah yeah." I look towards Asuka and give her a sheepish smile, "Asuka just... had an accident and hurt her foot."  
"啊，是的。" 我转向明日香，向她露出一个尴尬的微笑，"明日香只是……不小心出了点事故，伤到了脚。"

I hear Asuka mumble something angrily under her breath but I'm not able to catch it as Fuyutsuki replies to me, _"I see, well I hope it is nothing too serious. I know Ms Soryu dislikes such places. Regardless I shall not prolong this, I have heard back from the council."_  
我听到明日香低声愤怒地咕哝着什么，但我没听清，因为冬月先生回复了我，"我明白了，希望不是太严重。我知道副司令不喜欢这种地方。无论如何，我不会耽误太久，我已经收到了委员会的回复。"

My heart suddenly starts pounding in my chest as a sickly feeling forms in my stomach. It hits me suddenly just how much I want to hear him say they have changed their minds. I want this, I really, truly want this. I want to see Shinji again, I want to hear him play for us. I want Asuka to see him again, for their friendship to return properly.  
我的心突然在胸腔里狂跳，胃里涌起一阵恶心的感觉。我突然意识到自己有多么渴望听到他说他们改变了主意。我真心真意地想要这个。我想再见真嗣，想听他为我们演奏。我希望明日香也能再次见到他，让他们的友谊恢复正常。

I try to temper my expectations though. Try to tell myself what the most likely outcome will be. I try to maintain that they will not change their decision, why would they?  
尽管如此，我还是试图控制自己的期望。我告诉自己最有可能的结果是什么。我尽量保持他们不会改变决定的想法，他们为什么要改变呢？

"What... did they say?" I finally ask, my hand trembling.  
“他们……说了什么？”我终于问道，手在颤抖。

_"The council have agreed to reverse their decision."_ He does not waste any time in replying to me. It's strange, in a way I was expecting this moment to be like the one you'd see in a television game show. I imagine Fuyutsuki in front of an audience, an envelope in his hand which he opens up to reveal I'm allowed to travel, I've also won a selection of fine prizes and a speedboat.  
“委员会已经同意撤销他们的决定。”他毫不浪费时间地回复我。奇怪的是，在某种程度上，我曾期待这一刻会像电视游戏节目中的场景。我想象着富士树站在观众面前，手里拿着一个信封，他打开它，宣布我获准旅行，同时还赢得了一系列精美奖品和一艘快艇。

"R-Really?" I stutter out, "S-So I'm... allowed to..."  
“真、真的吗？”我结巴着说，“那我……可以……”

Asuka looks up at me and sees the grin that has spread to my lips. I can see the shock in her eyes and she leap up off of the bed, letting out a yelp of pain as her foot hits the ground. She hobbles over to me and snatches the phone from my hand.  
明日香抬头看着我，看到了我嘴角蔓延的笑容。我能看到她眼中的震惊，她从床上跳起来，脚一着地就发出一声痛苦的尖叫。她一瘸一拐地走到我面前，从我手中夺过手机。

"Fuyutsuki! What happened?" She asks him, "They... changed their mind? Even after..."  
"冬月！发生了什么？" 她问他，"他们...改变了主意？即使在那之后..."

Asuka switches the phone to speaker just before Fuyutsuki begins to reply to her, _"Hello Ms Soryu. Yes, they have agreed to, even after you said those things to them. I will admit, I was concerned about your outburst as well. A similar thing happened to Ikari but if anything, the passion shown by the two of you aided them in their decision."_  
明日香将手机切换到免提模式，就在冬月开始回答她之前，"你好，碇小姐。是的，他们同意了，即使在你对他们说了那些话之后。我必须承认，我也对你当时的爆发感到担忧。类似的事情也发生在碇身上，但可以说，你们两人的热情表现帮助了他们做出决定。"

"You mean... that actually helped?" Asuka exclaims.  
"你是说...那真的有帮助？" 明日香惊呼道。"

_"Indeed, although I wouldn't recommend you engaging in any further acts of debate or diplomacy."  
"确实，不过我并不建议你再参与任何辩论或外交活动。"_

I see Asuka nod, "I think I'll probably retire undefeated."  
我看到明日香点了点头，“我想我可能会以不败之身退役。”

_"Good."_ He almost chuckles, _"You should know that their decision was met with some resistance. Tokita will be fighting the decision but I don't think you have anything to fear from him."_  
"很好。" 他几乎要笑出声来，"你应该知道他们的决定遇到了一些阻力。富田会反对这个决定，但我认为你不必担心他。"

I try to think of something to say at this moment but I can't. I'm simply stunned into silence and wearing a big grin on my face. They actually reversed their decision! I can't believe it, I was certain they wouldn't. I am... actually going to be travelling to Japan in December with Asuka. I will get to see Shinji once again.  
我试图在这时找些话说，却无言以对。我只是惊呆了，脸上挂着大大的笑容。他们居然改变了决定！我简直不敢相信，我原本确信他们不会的。我……真的要在十二月和明日香一起去日本了。我将再次见到真嗣。

"What the hell was that guys problem anyway?" I hear Asuka ask Fuyutsuki.  
“那家伙到底有什么问题？”我听到明日香问冬月。

I actually hear Fuyutsuki chuckle at her question, _"Tokita has something of a grudge against anyone and anything connected to NERV. It is nothing that involved yourselves, I presume you are both familiar with the Jet Alone incident?"_  
我确实听到冬月对她的提问轻笑了一声，“时田对任何与 NERV 有关的人和事都有点怨气。我想这跟你们无关，你们俩都熟悉‘Jet Alone 事件’吧？”

Jet Alone? I try to remember but nothing comes to mind. Asuka nods and then looks at me, I shrug at her, "I'm not, they probably didn't consider it important enough to tell me."  
Jet Alone？我试图回忆，但脑海中一片空白。明日香点点头，然后看着我，我向她耸耸肩，“我不清楚，他们可能觉得这不够重要，没告诉我。”

Asuka also speaks, "That was that big commercial robot, right? They wanted it to replace the Eva's. Some sort of automated garbage that ended up failing during a test and nearly blew up half of Japan."  
明日香也开口了，“那是那个大型商用机器人，对吧？他们想用它来替代 EVA。某种自动化的废物，结果在测试中失败，差点炸掉半个日本。”

I feel my eyes widen with surprise, I truly had no idea such an event had occurred or that anyone else had tried to produce a machine that could match what the Evangelions did. I imagine my masters would not have been pleased by such a thing existing.  
"我惊讶得瞪大了眼睛，我完全不知道发生了这样的事件，也不知道还有人尝试制造能与 EVA 匹敌的机器。我想我的主人对这种东西的存在肯定不会感到高兴。”

_"Yes, Tokita was one of the leads for that particular project. He always said the reason his machine failed was due to sabotage from NERV. Since then he's held a bit of a grudge."  
是的，土歧田是那个特定项目的负责人之一。他总是说他的机器失败是因为 NERV 的破坏。从那以后，他就一直怀恨在心。_

I see Asuka roll her eyes, "Great, so I assume NERV did in fact sabotage it, didn't they?"  
我看到明日香翻了个白眼，"太好了，那我猜 NERV 确实破坏了它，不是吗？"

_"The particulars of that incident are not known to me."_ Fuyutsuki replies quickly and calmly, _"As it is, I seem to remember NERV being cleared and the Jet Alone project being halted immediately due to safety concerns. It is something we should put behind us."_  
“那次事件的具体情况我不清楚。”冬月迅速而平静地回答，“就我所知，NERV 被澄清了，而 Jet Alone 项目立即因安全问题被叫停。这是我们应该抛诸脑后的事情。”

"Right." Asuka says, "Well let's just hope he doesn't try anything else. So, is this it then, we can arrange the travel?"  
"好的。" 明日香说道，"希望他不要再搞什么花样。那么，这就是全部了吗？我们可以安排旅行了吧？"

_"Not quite."_ Fuyutsuki answers her, _"There are some slight details I think I should mention. Whilst the council have agreed to allow you to travel they have made it clear to me that you will be monitored more so than you are here."_  
"还没完全确定。" 冬月回答她，"有些细节我觉得应该提一下。虽然委员会同意让你出行，但他们明确告诉我，你会比在这里受到更多的监控。"

"Of course." I reply, I expected as much but I see Asuka frown at the news.  
"当然。" 我回答道，虽然我早有预料，但看到明日香听到这个消息时皱起了眉头。

_"A lot of things need to be worked out but I think you can expect to have a security team escorting you at all times. Your movements will be restricted, likely to your hotel and the concert venue itself but I will try to persuade them to allow for sightseeing."  
"很多事情需要解决，但我想你可以期待随时有一支安保团队陪同。你的行动将受到限制，可能仅限于酒店和音乐会场地，但我会尽力说服他们允许你观光。"_

I nod again, "I see, thank you. You... You have no idea how much I appreciate this."  
我再次点头，"我明白了，谢谢你。你……你不知道我有多感激这一切。"

_"Think nothing of it, it was Ms Soryu and Ikari who did most of the work. I merely arranged the meetings."_ He answers.  
"别客气，主要是索留和碇小姐做的。我只是安排了会议。"他回答道。"

"What about Shinji?" Asuka suddenly asks, "Does he know yet?"  
"那真嗣呢？" 明日香突然问道，"他知道了吗？"

_"Not as of yet."_ Fuyutsuki answers, _"It is quite late here in Japan but I will inform him in the morning."_  
"目前还不知道。" 冬月回答，"日本这里已经很晚了，我会在早上通知他。"

"How... did he do in his meeting?" I ask.  
"他... 会议表现如何？" 我问道。

_"He did well, he... well he reminded me of someone I once knew. Only in his case he was fighting for the right thing."_ Fuyutsuki replies, _"Tokita did of course try to throw him off course. Even choosing to reveal the nature of your relationship to him."_  
"他做得很好，他...嗯，他让我想起了曾经认识的某个人。只不过在他这里，他是在为正确的事情而战。" 冬月回答道，"当然，Tokita 确实试图让他偏离正轨。甚至选择向他透露你们关系的本质。"

"Shit..." I hear Asuka mumble under her breath. I feel the urge to say the same. We were keeping that quiet for the moment and waiting for the right time to tell him. Asuka continues to speak, "Did he really?"  
"该死..." 我听到明日香低声咕哝。我也有同样的冲动。我们本打算暂时保密，等待合适的时机告诉他。明日香继续说道，"他真的说了吗？"

I feel my heart drop slightly as the good feeling I had from being told the good news fades. That must have been tough for Shinji to hear. I can see Asuka is struggling with it too, her hand is now balled up into a fist and I can see her ready to punch something. I place an arm around her shoulder, hoping that I can save her from breaking her hand.  
当我得知这个好消息时的喜悦感逐渐消退，我的心微微一沉。这对真嗣来说一定很难接受。我看到明日香也在为此挣扎，她的手已经握成了拳头，我能感觉到她随时准备挥拳。我伸出一只手臂搂住她的肩膀，希望这样能阻止她把手弄伤。

_"He did, I understand you both wished to keep things quiet for the moment so I thought it would be worth informing you, just so you aren't surprised when you get there and everyone asks you about it."_ He replies to her, not seeming to be able to detect our awkwardness at hearing that, "With that said I must leave now. It is late here and it has been a long day. Enjoy the rest of your evening."  
"他确实说了，我理解你们俩都希望暂时保持低调，所以我想通知你们一声，以免你们到了那里被大家问起时感到惊讶。" 他回答她，似乎并未察觉到我们听到这话时的尴尬，"话虽如此，我现在必须离开了。这里已经很晚了，今天也过得很漫长。祝你们晚上愉快。"

"Yeah, goodbye." Asuka hangs the phone up and looks at me, "So... He told Shinji..."  
"嗯，再见。" 明日香挂断电话，看着我，"所以... 他告诉了真嗣..."

I hold Asuka closer to me as I try to go over it in my head. Shinji know this must have hit him hard. He loved her and now he has found out I am with her. I betray him and then return only to take away the one he loves. Not only that but I have allowed this to happen knowing how Asuka feels for him. I have managed to put myself into a situation I have no right to be in.  
我将明日香搂得更紧，试图在脑海中理清这一切。真嗣知道这件事一定对他打击很大。他爱她，而现在他发现我和她在一起。我背叛了他，然后回来夺走了他心爱的人。不仅如此，我还明知明日香对他的感情，却放任这种情况发生。我陷入了自己无权涉足的境地。

I am an interloper, a confused alien thrust into a confusing situation. I love Asuka and I hate the idea that she is hurt. The last thing I ever wanted to do was hurt Shinji either. Both these people do not deserve pain at all and yet, I do not want to be hurt myself. I want to live on and continue to feel this love that I do. If it were possible I wish I could... No, it isn't possible. It does not matter.  
我是个闯入者，一个被抛入混乱局面的困惑外星人。我爱着明日香，我痛恨她受伤的想法。我最不想做的就是伤害真嗣。这两个人都不应承受痛苦，然而，我也不想自己受伤。我想活下去，继续感受这份爱。如果可能的话，我希望我能……不，这是不可能的。这无关紧要。

I no longer feel good about this. I feel sick now. I feel like I should call him up and apologize. The only thing I can take from this is that in his moment of despair he still fought for me. Thank you Shinji Ikari and... I am sorry.  
我不再对此感到好受。我现在感到恶心。我觉得我应该打电话给他道歉。我唯一能从中得到的是，在他绝望的时刻，他依然为我而战。谢谢你，碇真嗣，还有……我很抱歉。

**10th October 2021 - Kaworu/Asuka's Apartment – Asuka Langley Soryu  
2021 年 10 月 10 日 - 渚薰/明日香公寓 – 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I am here once again, my finger is hovering over the button and moments away from calling Shinji Ikari. In the back of my mind I have that voice there once again telling me that this is a bad idea. I should just leave him alone, I've done enough damage to him and me calling him… I'll probably just hurt him some more.  
我又一次站在这里，手指悬在按键上，即将拨通碇真嗣的电话。在我脑海深处，那个声音再次响起，告诉我这是个坏主意。我应该让他一个人待着，我已经对他造成了足够的伤害，再打电话给他……恐怕只会让他更加痛苦。

Who knows what state he is going to be in! Rei said to me that he was fine but I know what Rei is like. She is probably just saying it so that I don't feel bad. After all, how can Shinji be doing fine? I lied to him and kept the truth from him. I knew how he felt about Kaworu and I'm sure what happened must have hurt him. I know if… well if Shinji and Kaworu were together then I'd be hurt.  
谁知道他会是什么状态！绫波告诉我他没事，但我知道绫波是什么样的人。她可能只是这么说，以免我感到内疚。毕竟，碇真嗣怎么可能没事？我对他撒了谎，隐瞒了真相。我知道他对渚薰的感情，我确信发生的事情一定让他很受伤。我知道如果……好吧，如果碇真嗣和渚薰在一起，我也会感到痛苦。

It isn't just Shinji that the voice is warning me about though. It's warning me about my own state. I'm running on barely any sleep, painkillers and caffeine. I'm not in a good place, in fact I almost snapped at Kaworu this morning just for daring to ask me how I was. Chances are I'll do the same to Shinji and then what?  
不过，那个声音警告的不仅仅是关于碇真嗣，还有我自己的状态。我几乎没怎么睡觉，全靠止痛药和咖啡因撑着。我现在的状态很糟糕，事实上，今天早上我差点因为渚薰敢问我怎么样而对他发火。很可能我也会对碇真嗣这样，那又该怎么办呢？

It's all my own stupid fault too. If I hadn't have let them get to me I wouldn't have said the things I did. I wouldn't have kicked that stupid skip and I wouldn't have a stupid broken foot.  
这全是我自己愚蠢的错。如果不是我让他们影响到我，我就不会说出那些话。我不会踢那个愚蠢的垃圾桶，也不会弄断我的脚。

The only good news that has come from it is that Kaworu is actually able to travel to Japan in December. That did make me happy but then it had to be ruined by the news of what Tokita had done. From ecstatic to angry in just a few seconds, that must be a new record for me. I am happy that Kaworu can come with me though. I wanted him there so much and I'm glad I was actually able to do something.  
唯一的好消息是，卡沃鲁真的能在十二月来日本。这确实让我高兴，但随后就被时田做了什么的消息给毁了。从狂喜到愤怒只用了几秒钟，这对我来说肯定是新纪录。不过，我很高兴卡沃鲁能和我一起来。我非常希望他在那里，我很高兴我终于能做点什么了。

I'm just frustrated that I can't even celebrate it because of my stupid foot. I've been told I need to rest it for a couple of weeks so now I have… nothing to look forward to.  
我只是因为这愚蠢的脚而无法庆祝而感到沮丧。我被告知需要休息几周，所以现在我……没有什么可期待的。

All I can really do is go against the advice the voice in my head is giving me. My finger hits the call button and I set the device down onto the table, switching it to speaker. It rings a couple of times and Shinji finally answers.  
我唯一能做的就是违背脑海中那个声音给我的建议。我的手指按下了呼叫按钮，然后将设备放在桌子上，切换到扬声器模式。电话响了几声，真嗣终于接听了。

_"Hey Asuka!" 嘿，明日香！_

I regret this already but to my surprise he doesn't actually sound unhappy. If anything he actually sounds quite happy albeit slightly tired.  
我已经开始后悔了，但出乎意料的是，他听起来并不难过。如果说有什么不同的话，他实际上听起来相当高兴，尽管略显疲惫。

"Hey." I answer him, finding myself unable to muster up any sort of confidence in my voice.  
"嘿。" 我回答他，发现自己无法在声音中凝聚任何自信。

_"Fuyutsuki told me the news! They reversed the decision, you were right, we were able to do it!"_ Shinji speaks and I find myself still surprised at the joy in his voice. Why isn't he upset? Why isn't he mad at me? Didn't I hurt him?  
"冬月告诉我这个消息了！他们改变了决定，你是对的，我们成功了！" 真嗣说道，我发现自己仍然对他的喜悦感到惊讶。他为什么不沮丧？为什么不生我的气？难道我没有伤害他吗？

Or was I… wrong? No… I can't have been. Not about this.  
还是我……错了？不……我不可能是错的。至少在这件事上不是。

"Yeah." I answer, "I was a little bit surprised to be honest, I… Well I might have lost my temper with…"  
"嗯。" 我回答，"说实话，我有点惊讶，我……呃，可能对……发了脾气。"

_"Tokita?"_ Shinji finished the sentence for me.  
"常田？" 真嗣帮我补完了句子。"

I feel a smile creep onto my lips, "Yeah… that guy."  
我感到嘴角不自觉地上扬，"是啊……那个家伙。"

_"He was an asshole to me as well."_ Shinji answers and I admit I'm a bit surprised to hear him say that, _"He said a few things that weren't very nice. He also… told me about…"_  
"他对我也挺混蛋的。" 真嗣回答道，我承认听到他这么说有点惊讶，"他说了一些不太好听的话。他还…告诉我了一些…"

"Me and Kaworu?" "我和渚薰？"

_"Yeah." "嗯。"_

"Look about that…" I start to speak but I really don't know what to say to him. I have no words to explain it to him, "I meant to tell you but…"  
"看那个…" 我开始说话，但真的不知道该对他说些什么。我找不到词来向他解释，"我本想告诉你的，但是…"

_"Don't worry about it."_ Shinji actually cuts me off, _"I… know you're a private person Asuka and… you didn't have to tell me. I'm really happy for you."_  
"别担心。" 真嗣居然打断了我，"我…知道你是个注重隐私的人，明日香，而且…你不必告诉我的。我真为你感到高兴。"

I listen closely to his voice for any trace that he might be lying to me. It's hard to tell from voice alone but it is Shinji and I… I can tell. He sounds sincere, he sounds… happy.  
我仔细聆听他的声音，试图捕捉他是否在对我撒谎的痕迹。仅凭声音很难判断，但他是真嗣，我…我能感觉到。他听起来很真诚，听起来…很开心。

"I know but… you shouldn't have found out like that. We didn't mean to hide it, we just…"  
"我知道，但是……你不应该以这种方式发现的。我们不是有意隐瞒，只是……"

I trail off again as I try to find the words. We were going to tell him, after the meetings to be exact but Tokita didn't give us the chance. We knew it'd be strange if Shinji saw us turn up holding hands and sharing kisses.  
我再次语塞，试图找到合适的词句。我们原本打算在会议结束后告诉他，但没想到富田没有给我们这个机会。我们知道，如果真嗣看到我们手牵手、亲吻，会觉得很奇怪。

_"I understand."_ He replies, _"You're both my friends Asuka, I know… that sounds weird because of what happened with Kaworu but… I do consider him my friend."_  
"我明白。" 他回答道，"你们都是我的朋友，明日香，我知道……这听起来有点奇怪，因为我和卡洛的事，但是……我真的把他当作朋友。"

"I lied to you though, for a second time!" I say to him, not sure why I'm so desperate for him to be mad at me. Why do I seem to want people to confirm the bad things I think about myself? I don't want to be a bad person, I don't want to be thought of like that, so why do I try to persuade people to think I am that person?  
"我再次对你撒了谎！" 我对他说，不明白自己为何如此渴望他对我发怒。为什么我似乎总想让人们证实我对自己的负面看法？我不想成为一个坏人，我不希望别人那样看我，那为什么我还要试图说服人们认为我是那样的人呢？

_"You didn't lie."_ He answers, _"There wasn't a lie, you… just didn't tell me yet. Why would I be mad about that? If you weren't ready then… I understand. I'm really happy you're together, you both deserve happiness._"  
"你并没有撒谎。" 他回答道，"没有谎言，你……只是还没告诉我。我为什么要为此生气呢？如果你当时还没准备好……我理解。我真的很高兴你们在一起，你们俩都值得幸福。"

I sink back into the sofa. God Damnit Shinji… You… You're too nice, you're too pure for your own good. I should have known all along that he wouldn't be mad about this because that is what he does. I should have known because if he was he could have just turned around and not agreed to help us after he found out.  
我陷回到沙发里。该死的真嗣……你……你太善良了，你太过纯净，对自己没好处。我早该知道他不会对此生气，因为这就是他的为人。我早该知道，如果他会生气，他本可以在发现真相后转身离开，不再同意帮助我们。

"Thank you." I finally reply.  
"谢谢。" 我终于回答道。

_"I'm just glad it all worked out."_ He says, _"I told Fuytusuki I'll arrange tickets for the two of you. You're still going to come right?"_  
"我只是很高兴一切都解决了。" 他说，"我告诉冬月，我会为你们俩安排票。你们还是会来吧？"

"Of course we are you idiot!" I laugh, "We wouldn't have gone through all of that to just turn around and not come! We will be there, so you better make sure you're on top form. I won't accept anything less than perfection from you."  
"当然会来，你这个笨蛋！" 我笑着说，"我们不会费尽周折后又转身不来的！我们会到的，所以你最好确保自己状态绝佳。我对你可不会接受任何低于完美的表现。"

_"I'll try…"_ He answers before pausing, _"Hey Asuka, do you… do you think you could arrange it for me to speak to Kaworu again? I want to make up for last time."_  
"我会试试…" 他回答后顿了顿，"嘿，明日香，你能…你能安排我再和渚薰谈谈吗？我想弥补上次的遗憾。"

I nod, "I'll speak to him when he gets back from work and sort it out. I'm sure he'll want to hear from you. What did you want to say to him?"  
我点点头，"等他下班回来我会跟他说的，安排好。我相信他也会想听你说话的。你想对他说什么呢？"

_"Just that… I wanted to say sorry for not hearing him out the first time and I wanted him to tell his side I guess."_ Shinji answers me, his voice becoming more serious, _"I… I don't know if I can say I forgive him but I want to still be friends with him and move forward. He… deserves that chance."_  
"只是…我想为第一次没听他说话而道歉，我想让他讲讲他的立场。" 真嗣回答我，语气变得更加严肃，"我…我不知道我是否能说我已经原谅他，但我想继续和他做朋友，向前看。他…值得这个机会。"

"I'm glad you feel that way." I continue to smile, it seems my plans are coming together, getting those two to talk again will be easier than I had first thought, "Well, I'm sure he'll be more than happy to speak to you."  
"我很高兴你有这种感觉。" 我继续微笑，看来我的计划正在逐步实现，让那两个人重新交谈似乎比我想象的要容易，"嗯，我相信他会非常乐意和你说话的。"

### Chapter 19: Scars To Prove It  
第十九章：见证伤痕  

**October 11th - Tokyo 2 – Rei Ayanami  
10 月 11 日 - 东京 2 号 - 绫波零**

I listen keenly as the notes from Shinji's cello glide through the air as he continues to play through this song. I look at him and it is as if he has transformed into a different person before my very eyes, he is absorbed into the song, his face one of pure concentration and confidence. He makes playing the complex sequence of notes look effortless as his fingers dance across the board. His other hand moves smoothly as it draws the bow across the strings.  
我专注地聆听着真嗣的大提琴声在空中飘荡，他继续演奏着这首曲子。我看着他，仿佛他在我眼前变成了另一个人，他完全沉浸在音乐中，脸上满是专注和自信。他让演奏这复杂音符序列的动作看起来毫不费力，手指在琴板上轻盈跳跃。另一只手则流畅地拉动弓弦。

I admit I am not overly familiar with this song. I have heard it during Shinji's attempts to rehearse but it is not something I have listened to on my own. When speaking to Asuka she has informed me that this song is considered a classic of the genre. I admit the song is interesting, it is quite lengthy compared to most music I hear and it has a high level of complexity.  
我承认我对这首歌并不十分熟悉。我曾在真嗣练习时听过，但并非我主动去听的曲目。与明日香交谈时，她告诉我这首歌被认为是该流派的经典之作。我得说这首歌挺有意思，相比我常听的音乐，它篇幅较长且结构复杂。

Quite curious is the fact that Asuka did express some mild annoyance as the songs recent popularity due to being used in a television show. This confused me, surely she would enjoy the fact that more people would hear this.  
颇为有趣的是，明日香确实对这首歌因被用于电视剧而走红表示了些许不满。这让我困惑，按理说她应该高兴更多人能听到这首歌才对。

The song comes to an end and Shinji plays the final few notes. Almost immediately I see him go from the confident instrumentalist to the shy person I know him to be.  
歌曲结束，真嗣弹奏了最后几个音符。我几乎立刻看到他从自信的乐手变回了那个我所熟悉的害羞男孩。

"D-Did I sound okay?" He looks up and asks me.  
"我听起来还好吗？" 他抬头问我。

I nod at him and smile, "You sounded perfect."  
我朝他点点头，微笑道："你听起来很完美。"

I look at him smile back and he blushes, "T-Thank you..."  
我看着他回以微笑，他脸红了，"谢谢你..."

"You are doing well." I say in encouragement, "Are the reheasals with the rest of the group going well?"  
"你做得很好。" 我鼓励地说，"和其他成员的排练进展顺利吗？"

He nods, "Y-Yeah... I think they are anyway. I had to miss the last few because of the meeting with the UN but they told me it's going okay and I've been trying to practice on my own. I can... play all of the songs now and I think everyone else can so they want to do a run of the show."  
他点点头，"嗯...我想是的。因为联合国会议，我错过了最后几次排练，但他们告诉我一切进展顺利，我一直在努力自己练习。我现在能...演奏所有的曲子了，我想其他人也都能，所以他们想进行一次完整的演出彩排。"

"That is good." I continue to smile, hearing my brother speak with confidence and passion is nice. He has gone so long trying to find something to enjoy and be passionate about. I hope this show is the first of many for him, "I am sure that everything will go well for you."  
"那很好。" 我继续微笑，听到弟弟充满信心和热情地谈论，感觉很棒。他花了很长时间寻找自己喜欢并充满热情的事物。我希望这次演出是他众多演出中的第一个，"我相信一切都会对你顺利的。"

"Thanks." Shinji sets his cello bow down for a moment, "Hey Rei... did you ever try to play anything?"  
“谢谢。” 真嗣放下他的大提琴弓，问道，“嘿，绫波……你试过演奏什么曲子吗？”

I shake my head, "No... Not properly, when I was younger our father did try..."  
我摇了摇头，“没有……小时候父亲确实尝试过让我学……”

I pause for a moment and wonder if this is really appropriate to tell him such things. I rarely speak about my childhood to Shinji, it is not a subject that tends to come up and with good reason. It is pretty clear to the both of us that we dislike the person that we call our father and any discussions make us uncomfortable. Still, he has asked me so I should answer honestly.  
我顿了一下，思索着是否该告诉他这些。我很少和真嗣谈及我的童年，这个话题通常不会出现，也有充分的理由。我们俩都清楚，我们不喜欢那个所谓的父亲，任何关于他的讨论都让我们感到不适。尽管如此，既然他问了，我应该诚实地回答。

Shinji seems to recognize the issue I am having, "It's okay Rei... He was a part of your life."  
真嗣似乎察觉到了我的困扰，“没事的，绫波...他曾是你的生活的一部分。”

"Okay." I answer him, "Our father did enroll me in violin lessons but I am afraid I was unable to take to the instrument. In fact, in my childhood I was not drawn to music in any way. It is only in more recent years I have come to respect an enjoy the medium."  
“好的。”我回答他，“我们的父亲确实给我报了小提琴课，但我恐怕无法适应那个乐器。事实上，在我的童年时期，我对音乐没有任何兴趣。只是在近年，我才开始尊重并享受这个媒介。”

"Oh, I see." “哦，我明白了。”

"I was however able to draw as a capable level. Although I did not take any art classes it would seem I had some natural ability in that area." I explain to him, "I would do portraits of father, Fuyutsuki and even Doctor Akagi during my medical assessments, I would also draw other things. There was always a lot of waiting around during those times so it helped occupy my mind."  
"然而，我能够以熟练的水平绘画。虽然我没有参加任何艺术课程，但似乎我在那方面有一些天赋。" 我向他解释道，"我会给父亲、冬月和甚至在医疗评估期间的赤木博士画肖像，我还会画其他东西。那些时候总是有很多等待的时间，所以这有助于占据我的思绪。"

Shinji looks quite surprised at what I have said. I expected this, I have never told him about my prior artistic endeavors. It is not something I have really done for a long time.  
真嗣听到我说的这些显得相当惊讶。我预料到了这一点，我从未告诉过他我之前的艺术尝试。这不是我很久以来真正做过的事情。

"I had no idea... I never saw you do anything like that."  
"我完全不知道...我从未见过你做那样的事情。"

He seems apologetic that he didn't know, "No one was outside of father, Fuyutsuki and Ms Akagi knew of it really. I had not demonstrated such abilities outside of that environment and by the time I met you I was not drawing as frequently due to the increased medication I had to take."  
他似乎因为不知情而感到抱歉，“除了父亲、冬月和赤木女士，真的没有人知道这件事。我在那种环境之外从未展示过这样的能力，而且自从我开始服用更多的药物后，我就不再那么频繁地画画了。”

When I speak I can hear the sadness in my voice. When I speak of my past like this I realise just how little of a childhood I actually had. I was encouraged to a minimal degree but I was never truly allowed to be a person. I was kept under a steady course of drugs to dull my senses and keep me focused on my purpose. I only wonder what I would be now had this not have happened.  
当我说话时，我能听出自己声音中的悲伤。当我这样谈论我的过去时，我意识到我的童年实际上是多么的少。我被鼓励到最低限度，但我从未真正被允许成为一个独立的人。我被持续地用药来抑制我的感官并让我专注于我的目的。我只是在想，如果没有发生这一切，我现在会是什么样子。

I was just a tool to be used, a means to an end. Not too dissimilar to Nagisa. Whilst I was given more freedom in my life than Nagisa was it was not enough to change my nature. Any changes in my nature would be curbed by altering the dosage of my medication. I was seen as little more than a workman might see a hammer of a screwdriver by my creator.  
我只是被利用的工具，达到目的的手段。与渚没有太大差别。虽然我在生活中比渚有更多的自由，但这并不足以改变我的本质。任何本质上的变化都会通过调整我的药物剂量来抑制。在我的创造者眼中，我不过是一个工人看待锤子或螺丝刀那样的存在。

Unfortunately, for my creator, I was able to push past that and become more than they had intended for me.  
遗憾的是，对于我的创造者而言，我能够突破那层限制，成为超越他们初衷的存在。

"I see... I... wish I had gotten a chance to see them."  
“我明白了……我……真希望有机会能见到他们。”

"Actually... You can." I answer him, "When Misato took me to NERV she found a lot of my old drawings. I can show you them if you want."  
“实际上……你可以。”我回答他，“当美里带我去 NERV 时，她发现了我许多旧画作。如果你愿意，我可以给你看。”

Shinji nods at me, "Yeah! I'd love to see them!"  
真嗣朝我点点头，“嗯！我很想看看！”

I smile back, "I shall get them after you finish practicing. I... must warn you, there are some of father in there... there are also sketches of yourself and Asuka in there. They... were the last ones I ever did."  
我回以微笑，“等你练习结束后，我就拿给你。我……得提醒你，里面有些是父亲的画……还有你和明日香的素描。它们……是我最后画的了。”

"T-Thats okay..." “没-没关系……”

Shinji picks up his notes and starts to go through them once again, picking out the next song he wants to practice. As much as I am enjoying hearing him play and aiding him with this, it is not the only reason I am here. I feel some remorse for what happened to him in his meeting the other day. He should not have learned about Asuka and Kaworu in that fashion. This is my fault, I should have told him. Once again, I have failed my brother.  
真嗣拿起他的笔记，再次开始翻阅，挑选下一首要练习的歌曲。尽管我很享受听他演奏并协助他，但这并非我在此的唯一原因。对于前几天他在会议上发生的事情，我感到有些内疚。他不应该以那种方式得知明日香和薰的关系。这是我的错，我本该告诉他。又一次，我辜负了我的兄弟。

"Shinji..." I start to speak before he can finish looking through his notes, "I... feel I should apologize to you for not informing you of Asuka and Kaworu's relationship."  
“真嗣……” 在他翻完笔记之前，我开口说道，“我……觉得我应该为没有告诉你明日香和薰的关系而向你道歉。”

Shinji sets his notes down and for a moment I see a look of sadness cross his face, he lets out a sigh and looks at me, "Asuka... already apologized for that. I told her she didn't need to and you... you don't need to apologize either."  
真嗣放下笔记，我看到他脸上掠过一丝悲伤，他叹了口气，看着我，“明日香……已经为此道歉了。我告诉她没必要，你……你也不需要道歉。”

"I do... I kept the truth from you and due to that I have caused you pain. I need to apologize."  
“我确实……我对你隐瞒了真相，因此给你带来了痛苦。我需要道歉。”

Shinji shakes his head, "No... You don't have to apologize. I... I know in this case it is more complicated and they probably wanted to keep it quiet. You did the same with one of your relationships and Hikari and Touji wanted to keep their relationship quiet at first too."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“不……你不必道歉。我……我知道在这种情况下事情更复杂，他们可能想保密。你也对你的某段关系保密过，而光和透治最初也想对他们的关系保密。”

I look at him in confusion, "But everyone knew they were together, it was obvious."  
我困惑地看着他，“但大家都知道他们在一起，这很明显。”

Shinji shrugs, "I didn't say it was smart."  
真嗣耸耸肩，“我没说那很聪明。”

"Does the news of their relationship hurt you?"  
“他们恋情的消息让你难过吗？”

Shinji nods, "Yes. It does... I... I loved Asuka. I loved her but... she doesn't belong to me. It's been five years, that is plenty of time for her to find someone and besides... I don't know if she liked or thought of me in that way."  
真嗣点头，“是的。确实...我...我爱过明日香。我爱她，但是...她不属于我。已经五年了，足够她找到别人，而且...我不确定她是否喜欢我或以那种方式想过我。”

I feel pang of guilt in my stomach and heart as I hear him say that. I know how Asuka felt for Shinji, I know she loved him. She had confessed as much to me over the years I got to know her properly. Yet, she found and fell in love with Kaworu. The human heart is a fragile and complicated thing.  
听到他这么说，我心中涌起一阵愧疚。我知道明日香对真嗣的感情，我知道她爱他。这些年来，她曾向我坦白过这一点。然而，她遇到了薰并爱上了他。人心是脆弱而复杂的。

"What about Kaworu?" I ask him. I admit, I do not truly know my brothers' feelings for Kaworu. I always did wonder what his feelings were for the boy but never asked.  
“那薰呢？”我问他。我承认，我并不真正了解我兄弟对薰的感情。我一直想知道他对那个男孩的感觉，但从未问过。

Shinji blushes but also shrugs, "I... I don't know. When he told me he loved me I... I thought I felt something for him. I do... I like him... I thought he was attractive so I guess because of him I figured out a few things I hadn't quite figured out about myself. Back then I... didn't know if it was because I was desperate for kindness..."  
真嗣脸红了一下，然后耸耸肩，“我……我不知道。当他告诉我他爱我时，我……我觉得我对他也有些感觉。我……我喜欢他……我觉得他很有吸引力，所以我想是因为他，我才发现了一些自己之前不太明白的事情。那时候我……不知道是不是因为我渴望得到善意……”

"But now you think it was genuine?"  
"但如今你认为那是真心的吗？"

He nods, "Yeah... I think it was. I like him... I don't know if I loved him then or even now but I care about him a lot. I want him to be happy. Thing is... even if I did love him not it doesn't matter, it's not like I can do anything about it."  
他点头，“是的……我想是的。我喜欢他……我不知道当时是否爱他，甚至现在是否爱他，但我非常关心他。我希望他幸福。问题是……即使我真的爱他，现在也无所谓了，我无法为此做些什么。”

"No... I suppose not." I lower my head and wonder if maybe there is. Asuka and Kaworu care for Shinji and Shinji cares for the two of them. It would not be normal by human standards but... if they care for one another then why would it matter.  
"不……我想也是。" 我低下头，思索或许还有可能。明日香和渚薰关心真嗣，真嗣也关心他们两人。按人类的标准这或许不正常，但……如果他们彼此关心，那又有什么关系呢。

"Don't worry about it, Rei." I look up and see him smiling, "It... It stings but... I'll be fine."  
"别担心，丽。" 我抬头看见他微笑着，"这... 虽然有点刺痛，但... 我会没事的。"

"That is... good to know. I am always here for you if you need me to be." I reassure him."  
"那... 真是太好了。如果你需要我，我一直都在。" 我安慰他道。"

"I know... thank you Rei." He nods at me and continues to smile as he selects the next song and starts to play his cello once again.  
"我知道... 谢谢你，丽。" 他朝我点点头，继续微笑着挑选下一首曲子，再次拉起了他的大提琴。"

**October 20th - Berlin – Asuka Langley Soryu  
10 月 20 日 - 柏林 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I step out of the elevator onto the thankfully empty corridor. As I put my foot down I feel a dull ache in it, the result of me having to put all of my weight onto the damn thing because my other one is still injured. The crutches are helping somewhat but I hate them, they make me slow and make it awkward for me to get around.  
我走出电梯，踏入这条幸运空无一人的走廊。当我迈出脚步时，感到一阵隐痛，这都是因为我不得不将全部重量压在这只脚上，因为另一只脚还带着伤。拐杖在某种程度上有所帮助，但我讨厌它们，它们让我行动迟缓，也让我感到尴尬。

This is the first time I've been out of the apartment in a week. We've only been out for around an hour and I've already decided I hate everything and everyone. I hate all those idiots on crowded streets and in crowded shops who can't seem to stop looking down at the phones long enough to see me struggling to get around. These idiots who nearly bump into me and then have the gall to blame me for it! They tell me to watch where I'm going!  
这是我一周以来第一次离开公寓。我们只出去了大约一个小时，我已经决定讨厌一切和所有人。我讨厌那些拥挤街道和商店里的白痴们，他们似乎无法停止低头看手机，以至于看不到我艰难地移动。这些白痴差点撞到我，然后还有脸怪我！他们告诉我注意自己的方向！

They're so lucky I need these damn things to walk around otherwise I'd take them and shove them straight up their a-  
他们真幸运，我需要这些该死的东西才能走动，否则我早就把它们塞进他们的——

"Asuka! Are you feeling okay?"  
“明日香！你感觉还好吗？”

I'm snapped from my, vaguely violent... okay very violent thoughts about crutches and orifices, by Kaworu's concerned voice. He's stood opposite me and looking at me with a worried expression, one that I've gotten used to over the last week.  
被真嗣关切的声音从我对拐杖和某些部位的，呃，相当暴力的念头中拉回现实。他站在我对面，带着担忧的表情看着我，这种表情在过去一周里我已经习惯了。

Everything I've tried to do he has been there, helping me and looking so worried throughout it. I appreciate the help from him but I wish he wouldn't worry so much, it's only a broken foot, it's not as if I'm about to die. Still... it's nice that someone cares.  
我尝试做的每一件事，他都在那里，帮助我，全程显得那么担忧。我感激他的帮助，但希望他不要这么担心，只是脚骨折而已，又不是快要死了。不过……有人关心还是挺好的。

"Fine." I answer, managing to take some of the annoyance out of my voice as I speak. I don't want to seem like I'm mad at Kaworu. None of this is his fault, it's all mine. I was the one who enthusiastically declared we were going to buy him a suit and I was the one stupid enough to break her own foot last week, "Just... idiots."  
“好吧。”我回答，尽量让自己的语气不那么烦躁。我不想让卡沃鲁觉得我在生他的气。这一切都不是他的错，都是我的错。是我热情地宣布我们要给他买套西装，也是我上周愚蠢到把自己的脚弄骨折了，“只是……蠢货。”

He smiles, "Yes, it is much nicer and quieter up here. The other levels were quite busy. I was actually concerned that at one point you were going to hit someone."  
他微笑道：“是的，这里确实更舒适也更安静。其他楼层相当繁忙。我甚至担心你会不小心打到别人。”

"Oh, believe me... I was." I nod back at him, "Shall we go and take a look then?"  
“哦，相信我……我确实如此。”我朝他点点头，“那我们过去看看吧？”

He nods, "Okay." 他点头，“好的。”

I follow him, slowly, into the wider room and see immediately that we are going to be a little bit spoilt for choice in here. I spot my target immediately, some seats towards the center of the room. As much as I hate looking weak, I really need to sit down and rest my feet. I swear to god, next time I'm angry I'm getting a stress ball. No more kicking steel skips for Asuka!  
我跟着他，慢慢地，走进了更宽敞的房间，立刻意识到我们在这里的选择会有些多。我立刻发现了目标，房间中央的一些座位。尽管我讨厌显得软弱，但我真的需要坐下来休息一下双脚。我发誓，下次生气时我要拿个减压球。再也不踢阿斯卡的钢制跳跃器了！

I look towards Kaworu, he seems somewhat overwhelmed and I can't blame him. All around use are suits and accessories of a variety of colour and style. I've brought him to a good place as well, not exactly high-end celebrity prices but definitely upper tier. After all, it's been a long time since we've seen them and It's a big occasion, we have to look out best.  
我望向薰，他似乎有些不知所措，我并不怪他。周围尽是各式各样色彩斑斓、风格各异的西装和配饰。我带他来的这个地方也不错，虽非顶级明星价位，但绝对是高端档次。毕竟，我们已经很久没见面了，这是个重要的场合，我们必须展现出最好的一面。

"That prices... are so high." he whispers to me, "Are you sure this is okay?"  
“那些价格……太高了。”他低声对我说，“你确定这样好吗？”

"Kaworu, neither of us are really struggling for money right now, are we? If we can't spend a little bit of our vast payoffs on fancy clothes then what can we spend it on?"  
“薰，我们现在都不缺钱，对吧？如果连我们丰厚的收入都不能花一点在高档衣服上，那还能花在什么地方呢？”

"Well I actually donate some of mine to charitable organizations, I sponsor several kittens and have helped build wells in under-privileged countries." He answers.  
"其实我会将一部分捐给慈善机构，我资助了几只小猫，还帮助在贫困国家建造水井。" 他回答道。

I look at him and shake my head, I did wonder why he had a drawer with several stuffed cat toys. I can't deny his heart is in the right place, I do donate money myself to charity.  
我看着他，摇了摇头，我确实好奇他为什么会有一个抽屉装着好几个毛绒猫玩具。我不能否认他的心意是好的，我自己也会捐钱给慈善机构。

"Look, this is a one off Kaworu. Neither of us have really done this before so let's just... for once get something big and expensive and make ourselves look better than everyone else there."  
"听着，这是第一次，卡沃鲁。我们俩都没真正做过这种事，所以就...这一次，我们买些大件昂贵的东西，让自己看起来比那里的其他人更出色。"

He seems confused by the motion, "Okay..."  
他对这个动作显得有些困惑，"好吧..."

"Look, just go and pick some stuff. I'll... wait here I guess."  
"听着，去挑些东西吧。我...就在这儿等着吧。"

I watch as Kaworu wanders off to the aisles of suit jackets and get myself comfortable on the seat. I'm much happier up here than I was on the lower levels, aside from a sales assistant who hasn't approached us yet we are the only two on the floor. I guess not many men need a suit today.  
我看着渚薰走向西装外套的货架，自己在座位上坐舒服了。比起楼下，我更喜欢这里，除了一个还没来打扰我们的销售员，整个楼层就我们两个人。看来今天不需要西装的男人不多。

Shame the same can't be said for the other levels. For some reason it seems the entirety of Berlin have chosen to come shopping today. I'm just glad I've already picked out my dress for the event. I've already ordered it so I need to go and pick it up from the desk a couple of floors down. I've decided on a simple but elegant halter neck dress, pleated at the bottom and in a dark red colour.  
可惜其他楼层就没这么幸运了。不知为何，今天整个柏林的人都似乎涌来购物了。幸好我已经选好了参加活动要穿的裙子。我已经下单了，得去楼下几层的柜台取货。我决定选一件简约而优雅的露背裙，裙摆是百褶设计，颜色是深红色。

It's been a while since I've actually felt excited to dress up that smartly for an occasion. The last time must have been that damn date with Hikari's sisters' friend and I can remember exactly how that ended up. Since then I've not really been too bothered with the whole thing, it's not that I don't like the idea of doing it it's just I've never been in a position of mindset to do it.  
已经很久没有因为要盛装出席某个场合而感到兴奋了。上次有这样的心情，恐怕还是和光姐的姐妹的朋友那次该死的约会，我至今记得那次的结果。自那以后，我对这类事情就不太上心了，并不是我不喜欢打扮，只是我从未处于那种心态去这么做。

For this thing though, because I'm seeing Shinji again after so many years, because of where we're going and because I have Kaworu I want to. I want to be there and show how beautiful I am, how handsome Kaworu is. I want to actually be noticed again, instead of hiding myself away.  
但这次不同，因为多年后再次见到真嗣，因为我们要去的地方，也因为有了薰，我想要这么做。我想在那里展示自己的美丽，薰的英俊。我想再次被人注意到，而不是隐藏自己。

I look around the room again for Kaworu. I can see he has two items tucked under his arm and seems to be looking at a third option. I wonder what it is he'll have picked out for himself. Problem is, as I look around at the large number of options, that Kaworu would likely look good in anything. White, Black, Grey, Blue, Red, he'd look great in anything.  
我又在房间里寻找卡罗鲁的身影。我看到他腋下夹着两件物品，似乎正在考虑第三种选择。不知道他会为自己挑选什么。问题是，当我环顾众多选项时，卡罗鲁无论穿什么都会很好看。白色、黑色、灰色、蓝色、红色，他穿什么都好看。

I smile, not exactly a bad problem to have I suppose. I get to watch my boyfriend model suits for me. Things could be worse.  
我笑了笑，这倒也不算是个坏问题。我可以看着我的男朋友为我试穿西装。情况本可以更糟。

He finally returns to me, and I see what he has picked out. He catches my eye, "I am sorry I took a while, there was a lot of choice and I was not sure what would work for me. I know I wear a suit for work but I have never been to an occasion such as this. I was uncertain as to what would be appropriate."  
他终于回到我身边，我看到了他挑选的东西。他迎上我的目光，“对不起，我花了些时间，选择太多了，我不确定什么适合我。我知道工作时穿西装，但我从未参加过这样的场合。我不确定什么才合适。”

I nod and look between the three jackets he has selected. I try to picture him in each one of them, wondering how the white shirt and dark orange tie we've picked out might go with each option. I find myself drawn to the lighter grey suit jacket at first but I think I'll have to see him wearing them first to make sure. I get to see Kaworu model suits, not exactly the worst problem to have.  
我点点头，目光在三件他挑选的夹克间游移。我试图想象他穿上每一件的样子，想知道我们挑选的白色衬衫和深橙色领带会如何搭配这些选择。起初，我被那件浅灰色西装外套吸引，但我想还是得看他穿上后的效果才能确定。能看到碇真嗣试穿西装，这绝不是最糟糕的问题。

I take a quick look at the other two options on hand, a dark blue and a darker grey. I look up at him, "Which one do you prefer?"  
我快速扫了一眼另外两件备选，一件深蓝和一件更深的灰色。我抬头看向他，“你更喜欢哪一件？”

He shrugs, "I like them all but I think... the lighter one might look better."  
他耸耸肩，“我都喜欢，但我觉得...浅色的可能更好看。”

I nod, "Let's try that one on first then."  
我点点头，“那我们先试试那一件吧。”

I carefully get to my feet and grab my crutches to help get me to the seats near to the changing rooms. As we do so Kaworu leans in closer to me, "Thank you for this Asuka but you know... You did not have to pay for this."  
我小心翼翼地站起来，拿起拐杖帮助我走向更衣室附近的座位。就在这时，渚薰向我靠得更近了一些，“谢谢你，明日香，但你知道的……你其实不必为此付钱的。”

"I know." I smile at him, "But I wanted to. Consider it a very later Birthday present..."  
“我知道。”我对他微笑，“但我愿意这么做。就当是一个迟来的生日礼物吧……”

I give him a knowling glance as he freezes and looks at me somewhat shocked, "L-Late... Birtdhay present?"  
我给了他一个心领神会的眼神，他顿时僵住，有些震惊地看着我，“迟...迟到的生日礼物？”

I nod at him again, "Mm... 13th of September isn't it? Did you think I, the great Asuka Langley Soryu would not find out about that?"  
我再次向他点头，“嗯...9 月 13 日对吧？你以为我，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷会不知道这个？”

"I... I..." I see him glowing red with embarrassment, admittedly I feel somewhat bad. I can already guess as to why he didn't tell me, "How... did you find out?"  
“我...我...”我看到他因尴尬而满脸通红，说实话，我感到有些内疚。我已经猜到他为什么没告诉我，“你...你是怎么知道的？”

"Rei told me." I answer him immediately, "At first I was a bit annoyed that you kept it secret but... I know why you did. It's not really... a day I imagine you want to remember."  
"丽告诉我的。" 我立刻回答他，"起初我有点恼火你一直保密，但是...我知道你为什么这么做。这不是一个...我猜你不想记住的日子。"

He shakes his head, "No... My... masters never really mentioned it to me, so I have never celebrated it before. As far as celebrating it now goes... how can I celebrate that day... so many people died so that beings like me could be born... I can't celebrate that. It is not a cause for celebration."  
他摇摇头，"不...我的...主人从未真正向我提起过，所以我以前从未庆祝过。至于现在庆祝...我怎么能庆祝那一天...那么多人死去，才有了我们这样的存在...我无法庆祝那个。这不是庆祝的理由。"

"Idiot..." I say to him tenderly, "You had no say in how you were born, you were born because of what happened but it was not your decision or fault. You have as much right to celebrate a birthday as I do. Never time... next time we will do something. Oh, and Kaworu... for the record..."  
"傻瓜..." 我温柔地对他说，"你无法决定自己的出生，你的诞生是那些事件的结果，但这不是你的选择或过错。你和我一样有权利庆祝生日。下次...下次我们一定要做些什么。哦，还有，渚...作为记录..."

He turns to grin at me, "Fourth of December?"  
他转过身来对我咧嘴一笑，"十二月四日？"

"Let me guess..." I fire him a grin back, "Rei told you?"  
"让我猜猜..." 我回以一笑，"丽告诉你的？"

He nods, "Yeah, she made sure to tell me. That is also the day of your second book release, isn't it?"  
他点头，"是啊，她特意告诉我的。那也是你第二本书发布的日子，对吧？"

"Exact same day." I answer with a bit of a sigh. I had almost forgotten about the release of the book. I've seen some hype for it in stores, promotion for it coming soon but for me I've wrote it now. It's being printed and I have no further part in the process aside from answering a few questions as 'Mari Makinami.' My focus now is on getting to Japan.  
"“同一天。”我带着些许叹息回答。我几乎忘记了这本书的发行。我在商店里看到了一些关于它的炒作，宣传它即将上市，但对我来说，我已经写完了。它正在印刷中，除了以‘真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯’的身份回答几个问题外，我在这个过程中没有进一步的角色。现在我的重点是前往日本。”

"We leave for Japan after that, will your foot have healed by then?"  
“那之后我们就去日本，你的脚到时候能痊愈吗？”

I shrug "Should have done, the doctor said it wasn't that bad of a break. Said it should only take four weeks or so."  
我耸耸肩，“应该好了，医生说那不是太严重的骨折。他说只需要四周左右。”

"Good." We arrive at the changing rooms and I sit myself down again. He kisses me gently on the forehead and then slips into the rooms to change into the first suit. I'm still angry at myself for what happened last week but the more I think about it the more I see just how smoothly things are going.  
“好。”我们到了更衣室，我又坐了下来。他温柔地吻了我的额头，然后溜进房间换上第一套衣服。我仍对自己上周发生的事感到生气，但越想越觉得事情进展得异常顺利。

All I need to do now is work on the next stage, and that is getting Shinji and Kaworu to properly patch things up. I don't think I should have any trouble with that. Both of them seem more prepared to speak than beforehand. I just want to make sure there is no awkwardness between us when we arrive.  
现在我需要做的就是进入下一阶段，那就是让真嗣和薰真正和解。我觉得这应该不难。他们俩看起来都比之前更愿意开口了。我只希望我们到达时彼此间不要有任何尴尬。

I suppose we were already able to eliminate one potential reason for awkwardness with Tokita letting slip mine and Kaworus relationship to Shinji. He seems to be taking it well but I... I know him. I know he can hide things well, if he is hurt about it then he can hide it. I've basically stolen the person he cares about and loves and Kaworu has... well Rei always said Shinji had feelings for me but I never believed or understood why.  
我想我们已经消除了一个可能导致尴尬的原因，那就是时田不小心透露了我和薰的关系给真嗣。他似乎接受得很好，但我……我了解他。我知道他善于隐藏，如果他对此感到受伤，他也能隐藏起来。我基本上抢走了他关心和爱的人，而薰……好吧，丽总是说真嗣对我有感情，但我从未相信或理解为什么。

I hurt Shinji so much, so why would he like me? Still, he hurt me too... there are things he did that some people would say I should never forgive him for. Things I've tried to not think about because it was just such a unique and horrible time. I have forgiven him for those things though, I hope he knows that. If not then... I guess I'll have to tell him.  
我伤害了真嗣那么多，他怎么会喜欢我呢？尽管，他也伤害了我……有些事情，有些人会说我不应该原谅他。那些我试图不去想的事情，因为那是一个如此独特而可怕的时期。但我已经原谅了他，我希望他知道这一点。如果他不知道……我想我得告诉他。

A few moments later Kaworu steps out of the dressing room in the first of the three suits. He's selected the light grey one and I feel my heart skip a beat on seeing him. I'm fairly sure my jaw drops as I look him up and down. It's ideal... it's... perfect. He turns himself around allowing me to see the front and back of the suit before coming to stop facing me.  
片刻之后，渚薰从更衣室里走了出来，穿着三套西装中的第一套。他选了那套浅灰色的，我看到他时心跳不由得漏了一拍。我敢肯定我的下巴都掉了下来，上下打量着他。这太理想了……简直是……完美。他转了一圈，让我看到西装的前后，然后停下来面对着我。

"Do you like it?" I hear him ask me.  
“你喜欢吗？”我听到他问我。

" . ." I blurt out quickly as I relaize my eyes are keenly focused on Kaworu's lower half. I look up and around the room, this is bad... I need to stop these thoughts... jumping Kaworu right here and now would be bad, especially with my foot but... damn he looks so good.  
" . ." 我急忙脱口而出，意识到自己的目光正紧紧锁定在渚薰的下半身。我抬头环顾房间，这可不妙...我得停止这些念头...在这里立刻扑倒渚薰会很糟糕，尤其是我的脚还受伤了...该死，他看起来真是诱人。

"Asuka?" He looks at me confused.  
"明日香？" 他困惑地看着我。

"You look great." I'm finally able to regain some composure and force those thoughts briefly from my mind. I'd like to think I'm above shoving Kaworu into a changing room and tearing his clothes from him. At least... until my foot recovers I'm above it.  
"你看起来很棒。" 我终于恢复了一些镇定，暂时将那些念头赶出脑海。我希望自己能超越把渚薰推进更衣室并撕掉他衣服的冲动。至少...在我脚伤痊愈之前，我是这么认为的。

"You... really think so?"  
"你...真的这么认为吗？"

"Of course!" I answer, "Do you like it though?"  
"当然！" 我回答，"不过你喜欢吗？"

He nods eagerly, "I really like it. I think... we should go with it. Or would you rather I try on the others first?"  
他急切地点头，"我很喜欢。我觉得...我们应该选这个。还是你想让我先试试其他的？"

I think about it for a moment, I could watch Kaworu try on two more suits here and admire the view or we could pay for it now, pick up my stuff and I could enjoy Kaworu taking off some clothes. It's not a hard decision to make.  
我稍作思考，我可以在这里再看几套卡哇鲁试穿的西装并欣赏这美景，或者我们现在就付款，取走我的东西，然后享受卡哇鲁脱衣服的过程。这并不是一个难以做出的决定。

"I think... We should pay for it, pick up my stuff and then get ourselves home. I think... I could do with some rest and you..." I slowly get to my feet, stumbling slightly as I get myself closer to Kaworu. I hobble across to him looking as attractive as I can with a broken foot, so much for seduction. Still I'm able to get close to him, closer enough to run a finger up the front of his shirt and feel him shiver at my touch, close enough for me to see the passion in his eyes and also the effect my words and actions are having on other parts of his body, "You... can help me relax."  
“我想...我们应该付款，取走我的东西，然后回家。我觉得...我需要休息一下，还有你...”我慢慢站起身，踉跄地靠近卡哇鲁。我一瘸一拐地走向他，尽管脚受伤了，我还是尽量显得迷人，但诱惑力大打折扣。不过我还是能靠近他，近到可以用手指顺着他的衬衫前襟滑上去，感受到他因我的触碰而颤抖，近到可以看到他眼中的激情，以及我的话语和动作对他身体其他部位的影响，“你...可以帮我放松。”

**October 20th - Berlin – Late Afternoon – Kaworu Nagisa  
10 月 20 日 - 柏林 - 傍晚时分 - 渚薰**

My eyes open slowly to the dim light of our bedroom. Ahead of me I can see Asuka's naked form still napping peacefully. I could wake her up but she looks so beautiful as she lies there I daren't disturb her. Instead I quietly get up off of the bed but not before kissing her softly on the forehead.  
我的眼睛缓缓睁开，适应着卧室里昏暗的光线。眼前是明日香赤裸的身体，她依然安详地睡着。我本可以唤醒她，但她躺在那里的样子如此美丽，我不敢打扰。于是我悄悄地从床上起身，临走前轻轻吻了吻她的额头。

I reach down and pick up my underwear from the floor and slide them back on followed quickly by my jeans. Shirtless I make my way around to the other side of the bed and just look at her resting form for a few moments. I think about how truly lucky I am right now to have someone like her in my life. It could so easily have been different, a part of me still thinks it should have been. I still feel like I don't deserve her love but... I am happy to receive it and I am so happy I can love her.  
我弯腰从地板上捡起内裤，迅速穿上，接着是牛仔裤。赤裸着上身，我绕到床的另一侧，静静地凝视她休息的模样。此刻，我深感自己是多么幸运，能有她这样的人出现在我的生活中。一切本可能截然不同，我内心的一部分仍觉得本该如此。我仍觉得自己配不上她的爱，但...我很高兴能接受这份爱，也很高兴我能爱她。

I lean over to my side to grab one of my pillows. Being as careful as I can I lift her leg up and slide the cushion under her broken foot to try to provide more support. I then pull the covers over her body and kiss her on the forehead one more time.  
我侧身去拿我的一个枕头。尽可能小心翼翼地抬起她的腿，将枕头滑到她受伤的脚底下，试图提供更多支撑。然后我拉过被子盖在她身上，再次吻了吻她的额头。

As I turn to leave the room I find I can't stop smiling. I move past her discarded clothes on the floor and the two bags of shopping that were promptly dropped when we entered. Several hundred Euro's worth of clothing unceremoniously dumped on the floor as we let our desire take over and we spent most of our afternoon making love to one another.  
当我转身离开房间时，发现自己忍不住微笑。我走过她丢在地上的衣服和那两袋购物袋，那是我们进门时急忙丢下的。价值数百欧元的衣物就这样随意地扔在地上，我们任由欲望主导，整个下午大部分时间都在彼此怀中缠绵。

Outside of the first time we ever did anything sexual I do not think I have ever been as nervous as I was this time. I was so hesitant, believing that if we were to do anything I would end up injuring her more. Asuka was quite insistent that I wouldn't, I hope that is true. I wanted her to feel as wonderful as I felt during it.  
除了第一次发生性关系外，我想我从未像这次这样紧张过。我非常犹豫，担心如果发生什么，我会让她受伤更重。明日香非常坚持说我不会，我希望这是真的。我希望她能感受到和我一样的愉悦。

I leave the room, taking a final glance as Asuka just as I shut the door, hoping that I don't wake her. I am aware that she has been having some issues sleeping over the past week, so these moments of rest will do her good. I can easily wake her up before dinner later on. Until then I should just relax and play a game, I'm currently several hours into Japanese made RPG that came recommended by Rei of all people, so I should get back to that.  
我离开房间，关门时最后看了一眼明日香，希望没有吵醒她。我知道她过去一周睡眠有些问题，所以这些休息时刻对她有好处。晚餐前我可以轻松叫醒她。在那之前，我应该放松一下，玩会儿游戏，我正在玩一款日本制作的 RPG，是丽推荐的，所以我应该继续玩下去。

I sit myself down on the sofa and pick up the controller, my thoughts turning toward four days from now, when I will have the opportunity to speak with Shinji once again. I can only hope that this time I am much better prepared for it. I need to make sure I know what it is I want to say to him and I need to try and ensure my emotions do not get the better of me. To borrow a phrase from him, I must not run away.  
我坐在沙发上，拿起控制器，思绪转向四天后的那一刻，届时我将再次有机会与真嗣交谈。我只希望这次我能准备得更充分。我需要确保我知道自己想对他说什么，并且要尽力保证我的情绪不会失控。借用他的一句话，我绝不能逃避。

Due to having an actual date for it and knowing what I need to do makes me feel slightly better about things, yet some of that nervousness remains. This nervous feeling, I have within me, it seems to be a core component of who I am now. I do not think I will ever be rid of it but at the same time I do not know if I would want to be. If I were rid of it would I also risk being rid of the good feelings that came with who I am now.  
由于有了确切的日期，并且知道我需要做什么，这让我对事情感觉稍微好一些，但那种紧张感依然存在。这种紧张的感觉，似乎已成为我现在的核心组成部分。我不认为我会摆脱它，但同时我也不确定我是否想要摆脱。如果我摆脱了它，是否也会冒着失去伴随我现在的那些美好感觉的风险。

When I was Tabris I did not feel these things. I feel... nothing. I felt what I thought was joy but it pales in comparison to now. It pales compared to the joy I feel when I cook a meal that Asuka compliments, it pales compared to the joy I felt when I found out I could travel, and it pales compared to the joy I feel when we make love.  
当我还是塔布里斯时，我没有这些感受。我感到... 空无一物。我曾以为那是喜悦，但与现在相比显得苍白无力。与明日香称赞我做的饭菜时的喜悦相比，与得知我能旅行时的喜悦相比，与我们在爱中感受到的喜悦相比，都显得苍白无力。

I realize I have to accept these negative feelings I sometimes have in order to feel the better ones. It is part of being human and if I'm being honest, these days I feel more positive than I do negative.  
我意识到，为了感受到更好的情绪，我必须接受自己有时产生的这些负面情感。这是作为人的一部分，如果坦诚地说，这些天我感觉积极的时候比消极的时候多。

I think this discussion will be a big hurdle for me to get over in terms of letting things go. I need to be able to talk to him properly. I know how much I hurt him and I am willing to apologize and discuss that. I just hope that he can listen and give me the opportunity to prove myself to him. I would be happy with that opportunity at the very least.  
我认为这次讨论对我来说将是一个巨大的障碍，尤其是在放下事情方面。我需要能够和他好好谈谈。我知道我伤他有多深，我愿意道歉并讨论这件事。我只希望他能倾听并给我一个证明自己的机会。至少，如果能得到那个机会，我会很高兴。

If we can get through this then I can finally allow myself some excitement for the trip to Japan. I have had a few brief bursts of excitement but I haven't allowed myself to get too carried away yet. After all, without knowing the reception I will get, how can I be excited for it? If I know I will be hated by the people there then... No... I shouldn't think like that. I do not think such a thing will happen.  
如果我们能度过这个难关，我终于可以让自己对去日本的旅行感到一些兴奋了。虽然我有过几次短暂的兴奋时刻，但我还没有让自己太过激动。毕竟，在不了解我将得到的接待的情况下，我怎么能为此感到兴奋呢？如果我知道那里的人会讨厌我，那么...不...我不应该那样想。我不认为会发生那样的事。

Still, I know my trip will not be without its problems. I have been granted more information on my restrictions whilst there. I'm going to be monitored 24/7 and have several restrictions put on me. There will be guards posted outside out hotel room and nearby all the time. Myself and Asuka will not even be allowed outside of the city to explore anything nearby and anywhere we would like to visit within the city will require us to submit an application beforehand.  
尽管如此，我知道我的旅程不会一帆风顺。关于我在那里的限制，我获得了更多信息。我将被全天候监控，并受到多项限制。酒店房间外和附近将一直有警卫驻守。我和明日香甚至不被允许离开城市去探索周边地区，我们想在市内访问的任何地方都需要提前提交申请。

It will be an annoyance to the both of us, more so for Asuka I imagine. For me I am still in the mindset that even being allowed to live somewhat freely is more than I deserve. It is perhaps a mindset I need to get out of and maybe I will do so in time. Yet the sins of my masters and what I used to be still weigh heavily on me.  
这对我们俩来说都将是一种烦扰，我想对明日香来说更是如此。对我而言，我仍然认为能够相对自由地生活已是我应得的。这或许是一种我需要摆脱的心态，也许随着时间的推移我会做到。然而，我过去的主人的罪行和我曾经的身份仍然沉重地压在我心头。

I suspect some of these additional restrictions are due to their findings in Tokyo-3 as well. I am probably not supposed to know but Fuyutsuki did tell me what they were able to find a living creature within the ruins of that old city. From what I understand it is a unified form of Adam and Lilith. Naturally he wanted to know if I had any idea what might have happened. After all, my soul was a fragment of Adams at one point but I no longer have any connection to that part of Adam. It is as much its own unique entity as I am. I am not Adam, I am not Tabris, I am simply Kaworu Nagisa, a human being and happily so.  
我怀疑这些额外的限制中，有一部分是因为他们在东京-3 的发现。我本不该知道，但冬月确实告诉了我他们在那座古城废墟中找到了一个活物。据我所知，那是亚当与莉莉丝的统一体。自然，他想知道我是否有什么头绪。毕竟，我的灵魂曾是亚当的一部分，但我已与那部分亚当断绝了联系。它与我一样，都是独一无二的个体。我不是亚当，不是塔布里斯，我只是渚薰，一个普通人，并且乐在其中。

Still this fusion does intrigue me. My knowlegde of them and their creators is limited outside of the few echoes I can remember from my time as an Angel. I know that they were created many years ago and sent out on varied courses along with several other so-called Seeds of Life. Something went wrong and both Adam and Lilith crashed here. It was something that should never have happened, two SOL on one planted shouldn't have been able to co-exist and for a long time they didn't, one even tried to kill the other but humanity had other plans.  
尽管如此，这种融合确实引起了我的兴趣。我对它们及其创造者的了解有限，除了作为使徒时能回忆起的零星片段。我知道它们是在多年前被创造出来的，与其他所谓的生命之种一起被送往不同的轨道。出了差错，亚当和莉莉丝都坠落于此。这本不该发生，一颗星球上不应有两个生命之种共存，而且很长一段时间内它们确实无法共存，甚至一个试图消灭另一个，但人类有别的打算。

The fact that they have now found a way to co-exist and even join in unison is beautiful to me, in its own way. Although it does have some ramifications for me. I know the powers that be in the UN will feel I have something to do with it or I might try to do something whilst there. Naturally I have nothing to do with it nor would I want anything to do with it. I simply want to go to Japan, I want to see Shinji, enjoy the concert and be with the one I love.  
他们如今找到了共存甚至合为一体的方法，在我看来，自有其美好之处。尽管这对我确实有些影响。我知道联合国的高层会认为我与此事有关，或者我可能会在那里有所行动。当然，我与此事毫无瓜葛，也不想有任何牵扯。我只想去日本，我想见真嗣，享受演唱会，与心爱的人在一起。

**October 24th - Tokyo 2 – Shinji Ikari  
10 月 24 日 - 东京 2 区 - 碇真嗣**

Once again, I have my phone in my hand and I find myself looking down at it nervously. All those familiar feelings are there, the slight trembling of my hand, the sickly feeling in my stomach and the lump forming in my throat. I'm scared because this might be the last time I have this opportunity to speak to him.  
又一次，我手里握着手机，紧张地低头看着它。那些熟悉的感受都在，手微微颤抖，胃里一阵恶心，喉咙里哽着一块东西。我害怕这可能是最后一次有机会和他说话了。

I've already worked out what it is I'm going to say to him and it terrifies me because it means finally speaking to someone about those things I did many years ago. It means I finally re-open a wound I don't know if I'm ready to re-open. It means I risk upsetting him and Asuka with it too. I really hope I don't but I need... I need to do this.  
我已经想好了要跟他说的话，这让我感到恐惧，因为它意味着我终于要向某人坦白多年前我所做的那些事。这意味着我终于要重新揭开一个我不知道自己是否准备好面对的伤口。这意味着我可能会因此让他和明日香都感到不安。我真的希望不会这样，但我需要……我需要这么做。

I need to tell him of all those bad things I did. I need him to know that I'm not the perfect person he thinks I am, that I have been selfish and cowardly. I need him to know this because I don't want there to be those sorts of secrets between us. I want this to be a fresh start... even if it ends up with him hating me. I am willing to accept that.  
我需要告诉他我所做的那些坏事。我需要让他知道我不是他心目中那个完美的人，我曾自私且懦弱。我需要他知道这些，因为我不想我们之间存在这样的秘密。我希望这是一个全新的开始……即使最终他会因此恨我。我愿意接受这个结果。

I let out a sigh and take a moment to try to compose myself. I can't let myself get into this state before I've even spoken to him. I need to stop overthinking this, just phone him... let him say what he needs to and then I can say what I need to and go from there.  
我叹了口气，花了一点时间试图让自己平静下来。我不能在还没跟他说话之前就陷入这种状态。我需要停止过度思考，直接打电话给他……让他先说他的，然后我再说我的，就这样继续下去。

My thumb hits the call button and it rings a couple of times before I hear his voice, _"Hello?"_  
我的拇指按下通话键，电话响了几声后，我听到了他的声音，“喂？”

I feel my heart beating harder in my chest just on hearing his voice. I also take some comfort in the fact that he sounds nervous as well. The idea of him being nervous is strange t me, when I met him all those years ago he came across as so calm and confident. He seemed to at peace and as if nothing would trouble him. I just have to remember he isn't that person anymore.  
仅仅听到他的声音，我就感到心跳在胸腔里加速。同时，我也从中得到了一些安慰，因为他听起来也很紧张。他紧张的样子对我来说很陌生，多年前我第一次遇见他时，他表现得那么平静和自信。他似乎内心平和，仿佛没有什么能困扰他。我必须记住，他不再是那个人了。

"K-Kaworu..." I start to reply, "Are you doing okay?"  
“K-Kaworu...” 我开口回应，“你还好吗？”

_"Yes, I am doing very well."_ He answers, I can hear him making his own effort to stay calm, _"Are you okay?"_  
"是的，我很好。" 他回答道，我能听出他在努力保持平静，"你还好吗？"

"Y-Yeah... I'm good. Thanks!" I trail off as we both fall in an awkward silence, the first of what I imagine will be many. I wonder if maybe I should start telling him some of the things I wanted to. Or maybe even ask him to tell me about him. Before I can decide he actually begins to speak.  
"嗯... 我很好。谢谢！" 我们陷入了尴尬的沉默，这可能是许多次中的第一次。我想也许我应该开始告诉他一些我想说的事情。或者甚至让他告诉我关于他的事情。在我决定之前，他实际上开始说话了。

_"I'm sorry I am not quite as... eloquent as you remember Shinji. This is... difficult for me. I have a lot I want to say but I feel I am not able to say it quite as easily as I would have hoped."_ He pauses for a moment, _"I suppose I should... thank you for what you did for me. You... have no idea how much it meant to me."_  
"对不起，我没有你记忆中那么... 能言善辩，真嗣。这对我来说... 很困难。我有很多话想说，但我觉得我无法像我希望的那样轻松表达出来。" 他停顿了一下，"我想我应该... 感谢你为我所做的一切。你... 不知道这对我意味着多少。"

"I-It's okay..." I blush as I answer him, "I... I'm glad I was able to help in some way. I thought it was unfair that they did that to you. I also... I also wanted to make sure you were able to come here for the concert..."  
"我...我没事..." 我红着脸回答他，"我...我很高兴能以某种方式帮到你。我觉得他们那样对你不公平。而且...我也想确保你能来参加这场音乐会..."

_"I... Thank you... Watching you play would be incredible. I am really looking forward to it."  
"我...谢谢你...看你演奏一定会非常棒。我真的很期待。"_

"I hope I can live up to what you expect them." I answer with a smile as my cheeks glow redder.  
"希望我不会让你失望。" 我微笑着回答，脸颊越发红润。"

_"I am sure you will."_ I can picture his smile as he talks to me and I feel that little sense of giddiness within me, _"Shinji... I... I am not quite sure I know how to say what I want to too you. I want to make sure I don't hurt you any more than I already have done, I don't want to make you angry but... if I do then please know I don't intend to. I just want to make sure you know the truth of who I am, and what I was. Last time we spoke I... I wasn't ready to tell you properly but now... I am."_  
"我确信你会的。" 我能想象他说话时对我微笑的样子，我感到内心涌起一丝小小的兴奋，"真嗣...我...我不太确定该如何向你表达我想说的。我不想再伤害你，也不想让你生气，但...如果我做了什么让你不快的事，请知道我并非有意。我只是想确保你了解我的真实身份，以及我曾经的经历。上次我们交谈时，我...我还没准备好坦白，但现在...我准备好了。"

"No... It was my fault too..." I reply to him as my hand tenses around the phone, the giddiness replaced once more by the sickly feeling, "I wasn't ready to speak to you either. I thought it'd be easier than it was but I was wrong. Please... tell me... I want to know, who are you?"  
"不...这也是我的错..." 我回答他，手中的电话握得更紧了，那份兴奋被一种恶心的感觉所取代，"我也没准备好和你说话。我以为会比实际更容易，但我错了。请...告诉我...我想知道，你是谁？"

There is a bit more of a pause as I feel more side-effects of my nervousness take over. I set the phone down on the table and switch it to speaker phone, my hand now sweating so much it's hard to hold the device. I place my other hand on my leg, forcing it down in an attempt to stop it trembling.  
我感到更多的紧张副作用袭来，停顿了一会儿。我把手机放在桌子上，切换到免提模式，我的手现在出汗太多，很难握住设备。我用另一只手放在腿上，强迫它停止颤抖。

_"My life started on September 13th in the year 2000... It was started as the result of Second Impact. Scientists for Gehirn were attempting a contact experiment with the dormant First Angel, Adam. When it happened it reduced Adam to an embryonic state and would set into motion the awakening of the Angels some years later..."_ He begins to explain.  
"我的生命始于 2000 年 9 月 13 日...这一切源于第二次冲击。Gehirn 的科学家们试图与沉睡中的第一使徒亚当进行接触实验。当实验发生时，亚当被削弱至胚胎状态，并为几年后使徒的觉醒埋下了伏笔..." 他开始解释道。

I listen keenly, "So... that is when you were born?"  
我专注地听着，"那么...你就是那时诞生的吗？"

_"Yes... When the contact experiment happened SEELE were able to somehow affix Adam's soul into a body they had prepared. They gave it two names, Kaworu Nagisa and Tabris."  
"是的...接触实验发生时，SEELE 设法将亚当的灵魂附着在他们准备好的躯体上。他们给了它两个名字，渚薰和塔布里斯。"_

"So... you're not that different to Rei then?"  
"这么说...你和丽其实没那么不同？"

_"No... I suppose I am not. Although unlike Rei I have no knowledge of which human contributed to the creation of my body. Such things I suppose are irrelevant and knowing those who created me the donor is most likely dead anyway."_ He continues, _"As Kaworu Nagisa I had a life. Basic education and piano lessons but soon it became all about my purpose on this Earth. One... which you already know..."_  
"不...我想我确实不是。虽然不像丽，我对哪个人的贡献造就了我的身体一无所知。这些事情我想无关紧要，而且知道创造我的人，捐赠者很可能已经去世了。"" 他继续说道，""作为渚薰，我有过一段生活。基础教育和钢琴课，但很快这一切都变成了我在这个地球上的使命。一个...你已经知道的使命..."

My mouth goes dry as I listen to him speak. As he tells me these things I can't help but compare him to my sister. She too was the same, raised for one thing, given only the basics.  
我听着他的话，嘴巴发干。当他告诉我这些事情时，我不禁将他与我的妹妹相比较。她也是如此，只为一件事被抚养长大，只接受了最基本的教育。

"I'm sorry... I had no idea. You... You were no different to Rei then..." I finally reply.  
"对不起...我完全不知道。你...你当时和丽没什么不同..." 我终于回答道。

_"Perhaps but... I still cannot help but feel I should have done more. I now know of the various lies and ways in which I was manipulated but it does little to ease my mind. Regardless that is the truth of what happened."_ he answers, _"The truth is Shinji, I was sent to Tokyo-3 to meet you in hope that it would help me achieve my supposed purpose. I was supposed to manipulate you for them and betray you at that moment and... I did exactly that."_  
"也许吧，但我还是忍不住觉得我应该做得更多。我现在知道了那些谎言和被操纵的方式，但这并不能让我的心情好受多少。不管怎样，这就是发生的事实。" 他回答说，"事实是，真嗣，我被派到东京-3 来见你，希望这能帮助我实现所谓的目的。我本应该为了他们操纵你，并在那一刻背叛你...而我确实那么做了。"

His words immediately cause me to relive that moment briefly. The moment I woke up and heard those sirens and moments later found out the boy I had fallen for was an Angel. I can still remember the confusion and the anger I felt at that moment. He had lied... he had betrayed me.  
他的话立刻让我短暂地重温了那个时刻。我醒来时听到那些警报声，不久后发现我爱上的人竟然是一个使徒。我至今仍记得那一刻的困惑和愤怒。他撒了谎...他背叛了我。

My voice is barely a whisper, "I know you did..."  
我的声音几乎细不可闻，“我知道你做了……”

_"When I look back on it I think that if I had just one more day... maybe I wouldn't have done it. Maybe I would have been able to fight against the call I felt within me or maybe... I would have found a way to take my own life and not have to put you through that."_ I can hear his voice start to tremble as he trails off.  
“当我回想起那一切时，我想，如果再给我一天时间……也许我就不会那么做了。也许我能抵抗住内心那股召唤，又或许……我能找到自我了断的方法，不必让你经历这些。”我能听到他的声音开始颤抖，话音渐渐消失。

"It's okay Kaworu..." “没事的，薰……”

_"I just want you to know that... although I was supposed to manipulate you my words were genuine. When I said I loved you I... I meant it. I felt something when I met you, I had... not felt that sort of joy in my life before. It made me question everything I knew and everything I was but I couldn't fight my greater purpose."  
"我只是想让你知道……尽管我本应操纵你，但我的话是真心的。当我告诉你我爱你时，我……我是认真的。遇见你时，我感受到了一种从未有过的喜悦。这让我质疑我所知道的一切和我所是的一切，但我无法抗拒我更大的使命。"_

"K-Kaworu..." I whisper back at him, my voice on the verge of cracking itself. My legs trembling as I speak.  
"薰……" 我轻声回应他，声音几乎要破裂。我的双腿颤抖着说话。"

_"Know this Shinji I... am truly sorry for the pain I caused you. I know no words or actions can make up for what I have done but I am willing to try. Also... thank you... because you proved me right. When I saw Lilith, when I knew I had to die I... I knew the strength of your heart. I knew you could move past what I had done and... you proved me right... You allowed me and everything else a second chance..."  
"你要知道，真嗣，我……真的为给你带来的痛苦感到抱歉。我知道任何言语或行动都无法弥补我所做的一切，但我愿意尝试。还有……谢谢你……因为你证明了我是对的。当我看到莉莉丝，当我明白我必须死去时，我……我知道你内心的力量。我知道你能超越我所做的一切，而……你证明了我是对的……你给了我和其他一切第二次机会……"_

"I... I forgive you Kaworu..." I try to say the words without letting my voice break and almost manage it. Strangely though I am smiling. His words have touched me, reached into my heart and brought tears to my eyes.  
"我...我原谅你，渚薰..." 我努力不让声音哽咽，几乎做到了。奇怪的是，我却在微笑。他的话触动了我，深入我心，让我泪眼朦胧。

I take a deep breath and try to calm myself before the next part. Kaworu... I forgive you but I am about to tell you something and I hope you can forgive me. I still haven't quite worked out how I'm going to word this, I'm not very good with these subjects in normal conversation.  
我深吸一口气，试图在接下来的部分前平静自己。渚薰...我原谅你，但我即将告诉你一些事，希望你能原谅我。我还没完全想好怎么表达，我在正常对话中不太擅长处理这些话题。

_"Thank you. Shinji... I am not sure I deserve your forgiveness but I will accept it."  
"谢谢你。真嗣...我不确定我是否配得上你的原谅，但我愿意接受。"_

"Kaworu there... is something I have to tell you now. I'm not quite sure how to say it but I think there is something you should know."  
"渚薰，现在我有件事必须告诉你。我不太确定该如何表达，但我觉得你应该知道一些事情。"

_"What is it?"_ He sounds confused.  
"什么事？" 他的声音听起来很困惑。"

"It's about Asuka... Well not so much about her but about something that happened between us before Third Impact. I... Has she told you anything about that time?"  
"是关于明日香的... 其实不完全是关于她，而是关于第三次冲击前我们之间发生的一些事。我... 她有没有跟你提起过那段时间的事情？"

_"No... Only that she was injured before it happened."  
“不……只是她在这之前受了伤。”_

I nod, "I see... I don't know if I should tell you... perhaps it would be best hearing it from her but... I am going to. I want there to be no secrets between us when we meet. I just ask that... you don't hate me for this."  
我点点头，“我明白……我不知道是否该告诉你……也许最好是从她那里听到，但……我会说的。我希望我们见面时没有任何秘密。我只请求……你不要因此恨我。”

**October 24th - Berlin – Kaworu Nagisa  
10 月 24 日 - 柏林 - 渚薰**

_"I see... I don't know if I should tell you... perhaps it would be best hearing it from her but... I am going to. I want there to be no secrets between us when we meet. I just ask that... you don't hate me for this."  
“我明白了...我不知道该不该告诉你...也许最好是从她那里听到，但是...我要说。我希望我们见面时没有任何秘密。我只请求...你不要因此恨我。”_

I look at the phone resting on table in confusion. I have no idea what Shinji is about to tell me or why I would hate him for it. If he hurt Asuka then sure she would not have the feeling she does for him, so what could he have possibly done to suddenly provoke this.  
我困惑地看着桌上的电话。我不知道真嗣即将告诉我什么，也不知道我为什么会因此恨他。如果他伤害了明日香，那么她对他的感情肯定不会像现在这样，所以他到底做了什么会突然引发这种情况。

I try to think back to what Asuka has told me about her pre-Third Impact life. The honest truth is that whilst she has confessed a great deal to me regarding her life little of it really included Shinji and herself. She spoke to me about her attitude towards him and how she treated him but very little else. Most of the discussion surrounded her earlier life.  
我试图回想明日香在第三次冲击前的生活中告诉我的事情。老实说，虽然她向我坦白了很多关于她生活的事情，但其中很少涉及真嗣和她自己。她谈到了她对他的态度以及她如何对待他，但其他方面几乎没有提及。大部分讨论都围绕着她的早年生活。

"Shinji I... am not sure I could ever hate you, especially not after what I have done to you. Please... tell me what you have to tell me, I am sure it is not as bad as you think."  
"真嗣，我...我不确定我是否能恨你，尤其是在我对你做了那些事之后。请...告诉我你想说的话，我相信它不会像你想象中那么糟糕。""

I try to take a few breaths to calm myself. The emotion from the phone call has been more intense than I imagined. Just hearing him say he forgave me nearly pushed me past the brink of tears. My chest hurts from it all but... I have to see this through.  
我试着深呼吸几次来平复自己。电话里的情绪比我预想的要强烈得多。仅仅听到他说原谅我，就几乎让我泪流满面。我的胸口因这一切而疼痛，但是...我必须坚持下去。

_"Okay I..."_ I hear him take a deep breath, _"I will start with the easiest thing then. This all happened... after your death... I... I did something terrible. Something really bad and... I know Asuka knows about it. I just... she never brought it up. I guess it's not the sort of thing that can be brought up but... I don't want to hide it anymore. I... I'm not the good person you think I am Kaworu... I... I am trying to be good but..."_  
"好吧，我..."我听到他深吸了一口气，"我会从最简单的事情开始。这一切发生...在你去世之后...我...我做了一些可怕的事。真的非常糟糕，而且...我知道明日香知道这件事。我只是...她从未提起过。我想这不是那种可以轻易提起的事，但是...我不想再隐瞒了。我...我不是你认为的那个好人，薰...我...我正努力变得善良，但是..."

He trails off, "Shinji... You are a good person but we all make mistakes. Sometimes we... betray our friends and threaten the destruction of the earth or sometimes we just say the wrong thing. I am sure what you have done is no worse than what I nor anyone else have."  
他话音渐弱，“真嗣...你是个好人，但我们都会犯错。有时我们...背叛朋友，威胁地球的毁灭，或者有时只是说错了话。我相信你所做的并不比我和其他人更糟糕。”

I actually hear him laugh at that before pausing. I give him a moment to figure out what he wants to say, _"Asuka's death... before Third Impact was my fault. I... I could have stopped it but I... I did nothing. I left Asuka up there to fight all by herself whilst I sat in front of Unit 01."_  
我确实听到他在那之后笑了笑，然后停顿了一下。我给他一点时间来想清楚他想说什么，“明日香的死...在第三次冲击之前是我的错。我...我本可以阻止的，但我...什么都没做。我让明日香一个人在那里战斗，而我却坐在初号机前。”

"Why?" I ask him, it's the only thing I can say. I know about the fight of course, Asuka has mentioned it once to me. I've seen the scars left behind by it... left behind my dummy plugs using my pilot date. I've felt the guilt from that.  
"“为什么？”我问他，这是我唯一能说的话。当然，我知道那场战斗，明日香曾向我提起过一次。我见过那场战斗留下的伤疤...由我的模拟插入栓利用我的驾驶员数据留下的。我感受到了那份愧疚。”

Asuka never told me why she had to fight that battle alone. I just assumed it was due to lack of a choice but Shinji could have helped her. Is that what he is telling me?  
明日香从未告诉我她为何必须独自面对那场战斗。我只是以为她别无选择，但真嗣本可以帮她的。他是在告诉我这个吗？

_"I... I don't know."_ Shinji answers me, _"When I got to Unit 01 so many things had happened. I had just seen Misato die, I had watched other people be shot and killed and Unit 01 was encased in this stuff. I didn't think I could move it but I... I didn't even try... I just sat and waited for someone or something to kill me... I..."_  
"我...我不知道。" 真嗣回答我，"当我到达初号机时，发生了太多事情。我刚刚目睹了美里死去，看着其他人被枪杀，初号机被这种东西包裹着。我以为我动不了它，但我...我甚至没有尝试...我只是坐着，等待某人或某物来杀我...我..."

"Oh Shinji..." I so wish I was there to wrap my arms around him right now. To hug him and tell him things are alright.  
"哦，真嗣..." 我多么希望此刻能在他身边，用双臂紧紧抱住他。拥抱他，告诉他一切都会好起来的。

_"I didn't even try though Kaworu... I... I could probably have commanded it to move or at least got into the cockpit but I didn't... I just left her to die."_ He tails off again, _"I had lost so much, I didn't want to lose her but after Misato and you I..."_  
"我甚至没有尝试，尽管卡沃鲁...我...我本可以命令它移动，或者至少进入驾驶舱，但我没有...我只是让她等死。" 他又停了下来，"我已经失去了那么多，我不想再失去她，但在美里和你之后我..."

"I had broken you... I am sorry I..."  
"我伤害了你...我很抱歉我..."

Shinji quickly cuts me off, _"No! No... My actions... Kaworu you did hurt me but... my actions were my own. No matter how damaged I was... I could still have done something. I... Oh god..."_  
真嗣迅速打断我，"不！不...我的行为...卡沃鲁，你确实伤害了我，但...我的行为是我自己的选择。无论我有多么受伤...我本可以做些什么的。我...哦，天哪..."

I hear a stifled noise from the other side of the phone and I wonder if maybe it would be a good time to end this. Shinji does not need to tell me anything else, especially if it is affecting him this much.  
我听到电话那头传来一声压抑的响动，不禁想着或许现在是结束这段对话的好时机。真嗣不需要再告诉我更多了，尤其是这件事对他影响如此之大。

"Are you okay, we do not need to continue this now?"  
“你还好吗，我们现在不需要继续这个话题了吧？”

_"I will be okay. I need to get this out. You weren't the reason I didn't help her then Kaworu... I had done something earlier in the day... something … horrible to her. Please don't blame yourself for my actions, I have to take responsibility..."  
“我会没事的。我需要把这些说出来。那时我没有帮助她，不是你的原因，卡沃鲁……那天早些时候，我做了一些……对她来说很可怕的事。请不要因为我的行为而自责，我必须承担责任……”_

All he is saying only further adds to me being confused, he is claiming he is responsible for her death but also doing something else to her. Asuka has not mentioned such a thing to me. I wonder what it could be.  
他所说的一切只是让我更加困惑，他声称自己对她的死负有责任，但同时又在对她做其他事情。明日香并没有向我提及这样的事情。我好奇那会是什么。

Still his words do unsettle me. I can't help but feel some responsibility because I know my actions helped to break him. If I had not done what I did then maybe this would not have happened.  
尽管如此，他的话确实让我感到不安。我不禁觉得自己也有责任，因为我知道我的行为帮助摧毁了他。如果我没有做那些事，也许这一切就不会发生。

"Tell me..." “告诉我...”

_"After you... after what happened I tried to visit her in the hospital. She was unconscious and she just looked so unlike Asuka... I... I wanted the Asuka I knew back. I wanted her to do something, I needed her to do something. To call me an idiot, to yell at me and to have that fire that pushed me forward..."  
"在你之后... 发生了那些事，我试图去医院看望她。她昏迷不醒，看起来完全不像我认识的明日香... 我... 我想要回我认识的那个明日香。我想要她做些什么，我需要她做些什么。骂我是个白痴，对我大吼大叫，拥有那种推动我前进的火焰..."_

"What did you do?" "你做了什么？"

_"I tried to wake her up... I was being stupid... she was under sedation but I shoot her and the covers came off. I saw her naked and... I did something horrible. I... I violated her..."  
"我试图唤醒她... 我那时很愚蠢... 她被注射了镇静剂，但我还是掀开了她的被子。我看到了她的裸体，然后... 我做了件可怕的事。我... 我侵犯了她..."_

V... Violated? For a moment time stands completely still as I try to process just what Shinji has said to me. My mouth hangs open in complete shock as my hands start to tremble. Did he really say that? Does he actually mean what I think he means? What the hell did you do Shinji?  
侵犯？那一刻时间仿佛完全静止了，我试图理解真嗣对我说的话。我的嘴巴因震惊而张开，双手开始颤抖。他真的这么说了吗？他真的是那个意思吗？你到底做了什么，真嗣？

"Shinji... What... What did you do?" I try to keep my voice as steady as I can. I can actually feel anger rising within me but I try to stem it. I don't want to believe that Shinji could be capable of something so... despicable. I need to hear the full story before I do or say anything.  
"真嗣...你...你做了什么？" 我尽力保持声音平稳。我能感觉到愤怒在心中升起，但我试图抑制它。我不愿相信真嗣能做出如此...卑鄙的事。我需要听完整个故事，再决定如何做或说什么。

Scenarios play out in my mind of what he might have done, of his hands on her whilst she slept. It makes me feel sick to think about it. Is this really what he might have done? Was he... that broken? Did I... break him that much with what I did. No, I can't blame myself, Shinji's actions were his own.  
我脑海中浮现出他可能做过的事情，想象着他在她熟睡时触碰她的情景。这让我感到恶心。这真的是他可能做的事吗？他...那么破碎吗？我...我做的事让他那么崩溃吗？不，我不能自责，真嗣的行为是他自己的选择。

"Shinji, did you... touch her?" I can't hide the darkness in my voice as I ask him the question.  
"真嗣，你...碰了她吗？" 我无法掩饰声音中的阴暗，向他提出这个问题。

_"NO! No No No No No! I... I didn't!"_ Shinji frantically replies to me, _"No... I... I didn't do anything like that. I... I... What I did I..."_  
“不！不不不不不！我...我没有！” 真嗣慌乱地回答我，“不...我...我没有做那样的事。我...我...我到底做了什么...”

"Shinji, calm yourself." I try to do what Asuka has done to me several times when I've been in that state. I keep my voice steady with a hint of harshness. I admit I feel some relief at hearing he didn't touch her but then what did he actually do?  
“真嗣，冷静下来。” 我尝试模仿阿斯卡在我处于那种状态时对我的做法。我保持声音平稳，带有一丝严厉。听到他没碰她，我确实感到一丝宽慰，但那他到底做了什么呢？

"Take your time, what did you do?"  
“慢慢来，你做了什么？”

I hear him take a deep breath, _"I... When I saw her lying there... I... touched... myself. I just... I don't know why, I... I just wanted to feel something good in some way and for maybe twenty seconds I did but then... I finished and realized exactly what it was I had done. I looked down at my covered hand and... I just felt sick and wrong... I wanted to die..."_  
我听到他深吸了一口气，“我……当我看到她躺在那里……我……碰了自己。我只是……我不知道为什么，我……我只是想以某种方式感受到一些美好的东西，也许有二十秒钟我确实感受到了，但随后……我结束了，意识到我做了什么。我低头看着我那被遮住的手，……我只觉得恶心和错误……我想死……”

I have to hold myself back from saying good, my anger nearly rising to the surface on hearing him admit this to me. I admit, I am at a loss on what to say, I can feel my nails digging into my leg as I try to calm myself down from being angry at him.  
我不得不克制自己不说‘好’，听到他向我承认这一点，我的愤怒几乎要爆发出来。我承认，我不知道该说什么，我能感觉到我的指甲深深地扎进我的腿里，试图从对他发怒中平静下来。

I'm finding myself getting angry at myself too because my brain is trying to make me blame myself. If I didn't play my part in breaking him I would have prevented this. Shinji would have fought to protect Asuka... he wouldn't have done this. This isn't my goddamn fault though, Shinji... no matter how broken he was is responsible for his own actions. In many ways just as I was.  
我也发现自己对自己感到愤怒，因为我的大脑试图让我责怪自己。如果我没有参与打破他，我就会阻止这一切。真嗣会努力保护明日香……他不会做这种事。但这不是我的该死的错，真嗣……无论他有多破碎，他都要为自己的行为负责。在很多方面，就像我一样。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

_"K-Kaworu I... I'm so sorry..."_ Shinji pauses again to compose himself. I can hear him sniffing and there is the sound of shuffling as I hear him wipe away tears from his eyes.  
""不，不，渚薰...我...我很抱歉..."" 真嗣再次停顿，试图平复情绪。我能听到他吸鼻子的声音，还有窸窸窣窣的动静，他似乎在擦拭眼角的泪水。

"And Asuka knows about it?"  
"那明日香也知道这件事吗？"

_"Y-Yeah... At least I think she does, she mentioned something once about us just putting all the stuff around Third Impact behind us."  
"嗯...至少我觉得她是这么想的，她曾经提到过我们只是把第三次冲击的所有事情都抛在脑后。"_

"I see..." I let out a sigh, not knowing how to handle this situation. This is not how I had thought this would go. I can't quite get the image out of my head of what Shinji has admitted either, the thought of it repulses me, that he could have done such a thing and yet... I feel pity for him.  
"我明白了..." 我叹了口气，不知道该如何应对这种情况。这不是我预想中的发展。我无法从脑海中抹去真嗣承认的那一幕，想到他可能做过那样的事，我感到厌恶，然而...我又对他心生怜悯。"

_"Do you... hate me?" "你...恨我吗？"_

"No Shinji." I answer, "I... could never hate you but... I do not know how to react to what you have told me. I am... angry but I know my actions probably played a part in your mental state back then. I know there were a great many things that played a part and..."  
"不，真嗣。" 我回答，"我……永远不会恨你，但……我不知道该如何回应你告诉我的事。我……很生气，但我知道我的行为可能在那时的你的心理状态中起了作用。我知道有很多事情都起了作用，而且……"

_"My actions were my own Kaworu... I... I know I wasn't myself but that doesn't excuse what I did. It... was awful and... I am sorry."  
"我的行为是我自己的选择，薰……我……我知道我当时不正常，但这并不能为我的所作所为开脱。那……很糟糕，而且……我很抱歉。"_

"I... do not think it is me you should apologize to Shinji." I answer him, "I... am glad you told me about this. I... would not like there to be these sorts of secrets between us either but it is Asuka who you should apologize to and speak about this with."  
"我……不认为你应该向我道歉，真嗣。" 我回答他，"我……很高兴你告诉我这些。我……也不希望我们之间有这种秘密，但你应该向明日香道歉，并和她谈谈这件事。"

_"You think I should speak to her?"_ He asks me.  
"你觉得我应该和她谈谈吗？" 他问我。

"Yes. I do." "是的，我是这么认为的。"

_"I... I will then." "我... 那我就去谈谈。"_

"Good." I reply, feeling myself calm down a little bit. I truly did not expect Shinji to tell me anything like this, my mind immediately goes to Asuka and how she feels about such a thing. She never told me anything like this had happened, does she truly know? Has she forgiven him? Did that play a part in her wanting to get out of Japan? I should ask her myself. I should try to find out these things properly.  
"好。" 我回答，感觉自己稍微平静了一些。我真的没想到真嗣会告诉我这些，我的思绪立刻转向了明日香以及她对此事的感受。她从未向我透露过这样的事情，她真的知道吗？她原谅他了吗？这是否是她想离开日本的原因之一？我应该亲自问她。我应该努力弄清楚这些事情。

_"I-If you no longer want to visit in December I understand..."_ Shinji suddenly says, _"I just..."_  
"如果...如果你不想在十二月来访，我理解..." 真嗣突然说道，"我只是..."

"Shinji." I cut him off, "I would not miss this opportunity to visit you and see you perform. What you have told me is... concerning and I admit I do not know how to process it, it will take me time but I... do not hate you nor do I no longer wish to visit you. I just require some time. If Asuka has forgiven you then you should forgive yourself and move forward... "  
"真嗣。" 我打断了他，"我不会错过这次拜访你并观看你表演的机会。你告诉我的事情...令人担忧，我承认我不知道如何处理，这需要时间，但我...并不恨你，也不想不再见你。我只是需要一些时间。如果明日香已经原谅了你，那么你也应该原谅自己，继续前进...

_"O-Okay I... I will try."  
"好-好的，我... 我会试试。"_

"Good. Goodbye Shinji, I will speak to you later."  
"很好。再见，真嗣，我们稍后再聊。"

_"Goodbye Kaworu." "再见，薰。"_

I hang the phone up and sit for a few moments in a stunned silence. My mind goes over what has just happened once more, from the elating high of being granted forgiveness and the promise of us moving on as friends to the lows of his confession.  
我挂断电话，呆坐片刻，震惊得说不出话来。脑海中再次回放刚刚发生的一切，从被宽恕的喜悦和作为朋友继续前行的承诺，到他坦白时的低谷。

I feel some of that anger come back to me but I try to stem it. What Shinji did was despicable but I try to remind myself of all the circumstances. I try to remind myself that the Shinji who did those things is not the true Shinji. Whilst is it true, this does not justify his actions it makes them understandable. I think then, perhaps what I should do is speak to Asuka about it. Find out if she did truly know about these things.  
我感到那股怒火又涌了上来，但我努力克制。真嗣的行为令人不齿，但我试图提醒自己考虑所有情况。我试图提醒自己，那个做出这些事的真嗣并非真正的真嗣。尽管如此，这并不能为他的行为开脱，只是让它们变得可以理解。我想，或许我应该和明日香谈谈这件事。弄清楚她是否真的知道这些事。

As I get up off the seat I look once again at the phone and see Shinji's profile card still on the screen. I try to push the thoughts out of my mind for good. I should not dwell on them any longer. It is not my business, it is between Asuka and Shinji now. It is for them to sort out and for me to respect Asuka's decision.  
当我从座位上站起来时，再次看向手机，屏幕上还显示着真嗣的资料卡。我努力将这些念头彻底赶出脑海。我不该再纠结于此。这不是我的事，现在是明日香和真嗣之间的事了。该由他们来解决，而我应该尊重明日香的决定。

Yet, I feel once more bit of anger within me and my hand instinctively curls up into a fist. Shinji... hurt her and allowed her to die. A part of me wanted to avenge that. It feels so stupid to want that given what I did but I have seen her hide those scars, I've seen her look at them with sadness and now I know they wouldn't be there if it weren't for him.  
然而，我心中再次涌起一丝愤怒，我的手本能地握成了拳头。真嗣...伤害了她，让她死去。我的一部分想要为她复仇。考虑到我所做的一切，这种想法显得如此愚蠢，但我见过她隐藏那些伤痕，我见过她带着悲伤凝视它们，现在我知道，如果不是因为他，那些伤痕根本不会存在。

If anything, this is just further confirmation of how confusing it can be to be human. I truly don't know what to feel.  
如果说有什么，这不过是进一步证实了作为人类是多么令人困惑。我真的不知道该有什么感觉。

### Chapter 20: Calling Me Back To My Home  
第二十章：唤我归家  

**October 24th - Berlin – Asuka Langley Soryu  
10 月 24 日 - 柏林 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I slowly push the door to the apartment open and awkwardly manage to get myself into the main entrance way. I feel like I'm finally getting used to these damn crutches but doors are proving to be a real challenge. This isn't helped by my tiredness from the long walk home. I could have just gotten a taxi back but no, I couldn't have done that could I? Why not? Because I'm Asuka goddamn Langley Soryu, that's why and looking like I need help is just something I don't do.  
我缓缓推开公寓的门，笨拙地设法进入主入口。我似乎终于习惯了这该死的拐杖，但门却成了真正的挑战。长途步行回家的疲惫无助于此。我本可以打车回来，但不行，我不能那么做，对吧？为什么不行？因为我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，这就是原因，而我看起来需要帮助，这是我绝不会做的事。

So, being the stubborn idiot that I am I decided to walk back to the apartment. It was a slow walk, in colder weather and on a dark night. Without crutches I wouldn't have minded, it would have been twenty minutes at most, hell I could have jogged home but no, the crutches turned a relaxing twenty minutes into something closer to an hour. Now I'm cold, tired and pissed off.  
所以，像我这样固执的傻瓜，决定走回公寓。这是一段缓慢的步行，在寒冷的天气和漆黑的夜晚。没有拐杖的话，我倒不会介意，最多也就二十分钟，见鬼，我甚至可以慢跑回家，但不行，拐杖把原本轻松的二十分钟变成了接近一小时的路程。现在我冷、累，还他妈的恼火。

The one saving grace of my excursion is that I will have given Kaworu and Shinji more than enough time to talk and figure things out between one another. That is of course if they have been able to figure things out between one another. I'm hopeful that they will have done but being honest, I don't know what to expect from those two.  
这次外出唯一的好处是，我给了渚薰和真嗣足够的时间去交谈并解决彼此之间的问题。当然，前提是他们能解决彼此之间的问题。我抱有希望，但说实话，我不知道这对他们会怎样。

I certainly don't expect them to be fine with one another but I hope they can at least be on a path to some sort of friendship. I hope they will have at least spoken properly to each other and laid out their feelings or whatever. You know, the sort of thing that adults do... Not that I'm very good at it.  
我当然不指望他们能立刻相处融洽，但我希望他们至少能走上某种友谊的道路。我希望他们至少能好好交谈，表达出自己的感受或其他什么。你知道，那种成年人会做的事情……虽然我在这方面也不太擅长。

I really know know what to expect from the two of them though. Shinji... well Shinji seems to be slightly surer of himself than he used to be. I can hear a bit more confidence in him when he speaks. I can hear more passion in him when he speaks and that is good. I do wonder if that is just because he is used to me and comfortable with that.  
我真的不知道该对他们俩有什么期待。真嗣...嗯，真嗣似乎比以前更加自信了。他说话时我能听出更多的自信。他表达时流露出的热情也更多了，这很好。我有点好奇，这是不是仅仅因为他习惯了我和这种舒适感。

As for Kaworu... I don't know how he will do. He seems passive in matters like this. Willing to accept blame too quickly and the consequences that come with it. I wonder... if I hadn't have fought for him to go to Japan would he have seen how unfair it was? I guess... the guy is still getting used to this new scary world. He is still dealing with his demons and I... I've been there. I know what it's like but he will need to snap out of it.  
至于薰...我不知道他会怎样。在这种事情上他似乎很被动。愿意过快地承担责任和随之而来的后果。我在想...如果我没有争取让他去日本，他会不会意识到那有多不公平？我想...他还在适应这个新的、可怕的世界。他仍在与内心的恶魔斗争，而我...我经历过。我知道那是什么感觉，但他需要振作起来。

I let out a sigh as I enter the main living space and grab myself a seat at the dining room table. It looks like Kaworu is out at the moment so I suppose I won't get any answers on how things went for a while. I guess it gives me time to plan for if they didn't go well. I'll need to take some drastic action, not quite sure what that'll be yet. Probably some weird threat of violence and casual usage of the word idiot knowing me.  
我叹了口气，走进主生活区，在餐桌旁找了个座位坐下。看来 Kaworu 现在不在，所以我想我暂时得不到事情进展的答案了。不过这也给了我时间来计划万一事情不顺利该怎么办。我可能需要采取一些极端措施，虽然还不确定具体是什么。大概会是一番奇怪的暴力威胁和随意使用“白痴”这个词吧，以我的风格。

I stretch out my leg and try to relax. Unfortunately, only a few seconds into my relaxation attempt my phone starts to ring. I take the device out of my bag to see Shinji's name on the caller ID.  
我伸了伸腿，试图放松。不幸的是，才放松了几秒钟，我的手机就开始响了。我从包里拿出手机，看到来电显示上是 Shinji 的名字。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

_"H-Hey Asuka, A... Are you at home?"  
“A-Asuka，你...你在家吗？”_

I can very easily make out the trembling in his voice as he speaks and I have to stop myself from jumping to any conclusions. Just because he is calling me now, after such a big discussion and seems emotional doesn't mean it has anything to do with that discussion. Maybe his cello string snapped and he needs moral support. It is Shinji after all.  
我能清晰地听出他说话时声音的颤抖，我不得不阻止自己匆忙下结论。仅仅因为他现在在一场大讨论后给我打电话，并且听起来情绪激动，并不意味着这与那场讨论有关。也许他的大提琴弦断了，他需要精神上的支持。毕竟，他是真嗣。

"I just got home a few minutes ago, what's wrong?"  
“我刚到家几分钟，怎么了？”

_"N-Nothing I-" “没-没什么我-”_

I cut him off, "Shinji... You're not a very good liar so don't even try... what is wrong?"  
我打断了他，“真嗣……你不太擅长说谎，所以干脆别试了……出什么事了？”

This time he lets out a sigh, _"Have you... seen Kaworu yet?"_  
这次他叹了口气，“你……见过薰了吗？”

"No. Why? What happened?" I feel my free hand tense up as the tone of my voice grows darker. My fears seem to be unfortunately realized, something did happen. What the hell did those two idiots mess up now?  
“没有。为什么问这个？发生了什么？”我感到空着的那只手紧绷起来，语气也变得沉重。我的担忧似乎不幸成真了，确实发生了什么事。那两个笨蛋这次又搞砸了什么？

_"Nothing... Nothing bad."_ He answers which eases my mind only a little bit, _"We spoke properly... He... told me about his life and I think... I understand why he had to do what he did. I... I think I can be friends with him... I understand more now."_  
“没什么……没什么不好的。”他回答道，这让我稍稍安心了一些，“我们好好谈了谈……他……告诉我他的生活，我想……我理解他为什么不得不那样做。我……我觉得我可以和他做朋友……我现在更明白了。”

Despite what Shinji is telling me he doesn't sound overly happy about it which confuses me. Is that not what we wanted from this? Should he not be happy about that? I'm glad to hear they were able to speak but then, why does he sound unhappy now? Add to which where the hell is Kaworu now then?  
尽管真嗣告诉我这些，他的语气听起来并不十分高兴，这让我感到困惑。这不是我们希望的结果吗？他不应该为此感到高兴吗？我很高兴他们能够交谈，但随后，为什么他现在听起来不开心呢？再加上，现在卡洛到底在哪里？

"Okay, good... So why do you sound upset?"  
“好吧，很好……那你为什么听起来很沮丧？”

_"Because I... I wanted to..."_, Shinji lets out another sigh, _"I told him things about me... I guess, with you two being together I wanted to be honest about things that had happened but I... I realize I should have spoken to you first before telling him and now I... I think he hates me..."_  
"因为...我...我想这么做...", 真嗣又叹了口气, "我告诉了他一些关于我的事...我想, 既然你们俩在一起, 我希望对发生过的事情坦诚相待, 但我...我意识到我应该先和你谈谈再告诉他, 现在我...我觉得他讨厌我了..."

Shinji trails off as my other hand now clenches tightly into a fist. Please tell me that isn't what has happened, please tell me we haven't now gone the complete opposite direction.  
真嗣的声音渐渐消失, 而我的另一只手此刻紧紧握成了拳头。请告诉我事情不是这样的, 请告诉我们没有完全走向相反的方向。

"Shinji... What the hell did you say to him?"  
"真嗣...你到底跟他说了什么?"

_"I told him about what happened... after he died and leading up to Third Impact."  
"我告诉他发生的事了...在他死后一直到第三次冲击。"_

It takes me a moment to truly understand what Shinji has said. My hand tightens on the phone as a barrage of confused imagery jumps into my mind.  
我花了一会儿才真正理解真嗣所说的话。我的手紧握着电话，脑海中涌入一连串混乱的影像。

"What?" I snarl angrily at him, "Shinji, what the hell did you tell him?"  
"什么？" 我愤怒地对他咆哮，"真嗣，你到底告诉他什么了？"

_"Everything..." “一切……”_

I hear his voice crack followed by a sniffing sound and I have to hold back to yelling at him. That won't do any good will it but it's a struggle. Shinji said that he had told Kaworu everything, that means... he told him about... that. He told him about the hospital room.  
我听到他的声音哽咽，接着是抽鼻子的声音，我不得不强忍住对他大吼的冲动。那样做不会有任何好处，不是吗？但这是场挣扎。真嗣说他已经把一切都告诉了渚薰，那就意味着……他告诉了他关于……那件事。他告诉了他关于那个病房的事。

God damn it Shinji, why the hell would you tell him that? Why the hell would you tell anyone that without speaking to me first? Why mention it? I told you... I told you years ago to just forget about it. I said I knew all about it. I knew about what he did, about the hospital room, about leaving me and the confusion within Third Impact itself. I said to just forget about it. I don't want to remember... I don't want to think about it.  
该死的真嗣，你他妈为什么要告诉他这些？为什么在和我商量之前就告诉任何人？为什么要提起？我告诉过你……多年前我就告诉过你，就当那件事没发生过。我说我全都知道。我知道他做了什么，知道那个病房，知道他离开我和第三次冲击中的混乱。我说过就当那件事没发生过。我不想记得……我不想去想它。

"Idiot!" I raise my voice, "Why? Why would you bring that up to him of all people? Do you think I'd want that being brought up? You... You idiot! I told you once... I knew about it. I know what you did I just... I wanted to fucking forget all about it. I wanted to forget that you did such a revolting fucking thing. I wanted to forget about that fight. Why... Why mention it... Why tell him without speaking to me first?"  
"白痴！" 我提高了声音，"为什么？为什么偏偏要跟他提起那件事？你以为我会希望那件事被提起吗？你……你这个白痴！我告诉过你一次……我知道那件事。我知道你做了什么，我只是……我他妈的想忘掉这一切。我想忘记你做了那么恶心的事。我想忘记那场争吵。为什么……为什么要提起它……为什么不等先跟我谈谈就告诉他？"

_"A-Asuka... I... I'm sorry I..."  
"明日香……我……我很抱歉我……"_

"No... Just shut up!" I interupt him, "Just don't... don't say another goddamn word, you've said enough. Just... go away."  
"不……闭嘴！" 我打断他，"什么都别再说了，你已经说得够多了。就……走开吧。"

_"Asuka I'm..." "Asuka，我……"_

"Sorry? Yes, I know you're sorry!" I snap back, "I'll deal with you and your stupid apologies later!"  
"什么？对，我知道你很抱歉！" 我厉声回击，"待会儿再跟你算账，还有你那些愚蠢的道歉！"

_"I just thought-" "我只是觉得——"_

"No! I don't care what you thought! I'm not talking about that with you now! You want to have that discussion then we have it on my terms and now you've opened that door we will be talking about it. Just... go away!"  
"不！我不在乎你怎么想！我现在不想和你谈这个！你要讨论那件事，那就按我的条件来，既然你已经打开了这扇门，我们就会谈及它。只是...走开！"

_"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."_

"GO!"

_"O-Okay..." “好...好的...”_

Shinji hangs up the phone and I have to fight the sudden strong urge to throw my phone against the wall of kick the leg of the table. Instead I settle for taking my clenched fist and slamming it down against the table.  
真嗣挂断了电话，我强忍着突然涌起的强烈冲动，想要把手机摔在墙上或踢桌子腿。最终，我选择紧握拳头，猛地砸向桌子。

"GOD DAMNIT!" I yell out in a mix of anger and pain as I feel pain shoot through my hand. I curse my stupidity, that's all I need isn't it? A broken hand to go alongside my broken foot which also goes alongside the outing of one of the worst things someone has ever done to me.  
"该死！"" 我混合着愤怒与疼痛大喊，感到手上传来一阵剧痛。我咒骂自己的愚蠢，这不正是我需要的吗？一只断手，再加上我那只已经骨折的脚，还有那件别人对我做过的最糟糕的事情被揭露出来。

I have tried... I've tried to put that moment out of my mind. I've tried to find ways to forget about it because I just couldn't comprehend it. I know exactly what he did. I saw it when Third Impact started. When he came crawling to me to help him. When I told him exactly where to go and nearly told him to end this stupid world there and then.  
我曾尝试...我试图将那一刻从脑海中抹去。我试图找到遗忘它的方法，因为我实在无法理解。我清楚地知道他做了什么。在第三次冲击开始时，我看到了。当他爬过来向我求助时。当我明确告诉他该去哪里，差点让他当场结束这个愚蠢的世界时。

I take a few deep breaths to calm myself. Anger will do me no good here, I know that but anger is what I know and I'm good at being angry. Still, it can't help me here, those things are out to Kaworu and now I have to figure out what to do.  
我深呼吸几次以平复心情。愤怒在这里对我毫无帮助，我知道这一点，但愤怒是我所熟悉的，我擅长愤怒。然而，它在这里帮不了我，那些东西正针对着渚薰，现在我必须想出该怎么办。

Those moments... I was willing to forget about it all and move on. I know how broken he was then, I saw how broken he was. I know how broken I was so I just... allowed that lapse of sanity. I allowed it because I knew deep down it wasn't the actions of the real Shinji. The real Shinji, for all I called him a pervert would never have done that.  
那些时刻...我本打算忘记这一切，继续前行。我知道他当时有多么破碎，我看到了他的破碎。我也知道我有多么破碎，所以我...允许了那次理智的失守。我允许了，因为我知道内心深处那不是真正的真嗣的行为。真正的真嗣，尽管我曾称他为变态，但他绝不会做出那种事。

It was spur of the moment, a horrible and repulsive act and I hate that it happened. I feel sick to think about it and want it erased from my memory but I can only imagine it's the same for him too. Still... why did he have to tell Kaworu now? Why when I'm working to try and get you two to be fucking friends? How the hell does your mind even work?  
那是一时冲动，一个可怕且令人厌恶的行为，我痛恨它的发生。想到这些我感到恶心，希望它能从我的记忆中抹去，但我只能想象这对他来说也是一样的。尽管如此...为什么他非得现在告诉渚薰？为什么在我努力让你们俩成为朋友的时候？你的脑子到底是怎么想的？

**October 24th - Berlin – Kaworu Nagisa  
10 月 24 日 - 柏林 - 渚薰**

I'm almost back at the apartment and I can feel the nerves starting to set in once again. I had thought that going out for a walk might have helped me clear my mind and come to terms with what I had been told but it has done little. Instead all I have done is go over the conversation with Shinji. I keep on repeating his confessions to me over and over.  
我快回到公寓了，紧张感再次袭来。我本以为出去散步可能会帮助我理清思绪，接受我所听到的事实，但效果甚微。相反，我一直在回想与真嗣的对话。我不停地重复他对我的告白。

My mind has even gone so far as to conjure up mental images of what happened. I picture Asuka lying their vulnerable as he stands by her side. I picture her fighting those mass-produced monstrosities and then tearing her apart. The latter disturbs me more, knowing that those beasts were running using dummy plugs based on me. In a way... I killed Asuka.  
我的脑海甚至已经想象出了当时的情景。我看到明日香躺在那里，无助地在他身边。我看到她与那些量产型怪物搏斗，然后被撕裂。后者更让我不安，因为我知道那些怪物是基于我的模拟插件在行动。在某种程度上...是我杀了明日香。

The mental imagery makes me feel sick but I simply don't know what I can do or say about it. A part of me wants to be angry at it all but I cannot. I feel like there is some barrier in place stopping me at the cusp of it all. I feel like I don't have the right to be angry at anyone, I feel like I can't be angry at anyone. It's because of who I am, because of who I was. I just have to accept it, accept and repress and watch others deal with it. I can't get too involved.  
那些心理意象让我感到恶心，但我真的不知道能对此做些什么或说些什么。一部分的我想要对这一切感到愤怒，但我做不到。我感觉似乎有一道屏障阻止我在这一切的边缘停下。我觉得我没有权利对任何人发怒，我觉得我不能对任何人发怒。这都是因为我是谁，因为我曾经是谁。我只能接受它，接受并压抑，看着别人处理它。我不能太过投入。

Why though... why did you confess those things to me now Shinji? You said you wanted no secrets between us but this wasn't just about us. This was about you and Asuka. Why confess such a thing to me and not speak with Asuka first. Is that not how things should be done? I know... in the past you found it easy to open up to me, it is something Asuka has also mentioned but surely it was not appropriate now.  
可是为什么……为什么你现在要对我说这些，真嗣？你说你希望我们之间没有秘密，但这不仅仅是关于我们。这是关于你和明日香。为什么要把这样的事情告诉我而不是先和明日香谈。这不是应该的顺序吗？我知道……过去你很容易向我敞开心扉，这也是明日香提到过的，但这次肯定不合适。

Shinji... I do not dislike you for doing such a thing, I know you needed to get it off your chest but why to me? Asuka is the victim and not me. All I have now are questions and uncertainty, a whirlwind of emotion that I don't know how to deal with. What do I do now? Do I discuss this with Asuka? Do I just ignore it and hope for them to work it out?  
真嗣...我并不因为你做了这样的事而讨厌你，我知道你需要倾诉，但为什么选择我？明日香才是受害者，而不是我。我现在满脑子都是疑问和不确定，情感的漩涡让我不知所措。我现在该怎么办？我该和明日香讨论这件事吗？还是干脆无视它，希望他们自己解决？

Before I know it I'm back at the apartment. Asuka should be home by now and I wonder if she has spoken to Shinji yet. Will she know about the things he told me? I let out a sigh and try to gather myself before I open the door. Accept and repress Kaworu. Accept and repress. Remember you are here but have no right to be, know your place.  
不知不觉间，我回到了公寓。明日香现在应该已经到家了，不知道她是否已经和真嗣谈过。她会知道真嗣告诉我的那些事吗？我叹了口气，试图整理自己的情绪，然后打开门。接受并压抑，接受并压抑。记住你在这里，但没有权利在这里，知道你的位置。

I instead try to focus on the positives of today. First and most immediate is that Asuka will be happy with the gifts I've gotten her. A small stuffed toy and box of chocolates, her favourite so that is something good. The confession aside, I think me and Shinji made real progress. We seem to be friends again and that is what we wanted from it. So those two things balance out the confession, right?  
我转而尝试关注今天的好事。首先也是最直接的，是明日香会喜欢我给她买的礼物。一个小毛绒玩具和一盒巧克力，她最喜欢的，这是件好事。除了告白之外，我觉得我和真嗣确实取得了进展。我们似乎又成了朋友，这也是我们想要的。所以这两件事抵消了告白，对吧？

I push open the door, "I'm home!"  
我推开门，喊道：“我回来了！”

"Welcome home!" I hear Asuka call back to me from the next room. I quickly kick off my shoes and step through into the room. I'm greeted by the smell of freshly made coffee. Asuka is sat at the dining room table, her back currently to me. I turn to see the just used coffee maker on the counter.  
“欢迎回家！”我听到从隔壁房间传来明日香的声音。我迅速踢掉鞋子，走进房间。迎面而来的是刚煮好的咖啡香气。明日香正坐在餐厅的桌子旁，背对着我。我转身看到柜台上刚用过的咖啡机。

I take a few steps towards her and try to force out anything negative. Instead I put on my best smile and present her with the gifts, "I got you these!"  
我向她走近几步，努力不让任何负面情绪流露出来。相反，我露出最灿烂的笑容，把礼物递给她，“我给你买了这些！”

She takes both items from my hand and looks up at me, half smiling and half confused, "O-Oh, thank you! What's with the gifts?"  
她从我手中接过两样东西，抬头看着我，半是微笑半是困惑，“哦，谢谢你！怎么突然送礼物？”

"It is my way of saying thank you." I half lie, the gifts are in some way a way of saying thank you but they're also a way to try to make me feel good about today, "I was able to speak with Shinji today."  
“这是我表达感谢的方式。”我半真半假地说道，这些礼物在某种程度上确实是感谢，但同时也是为了让自己今天感觉好一些，“今天我和真嗣聊了聊。”

"Oh, I see." She sets the items down and I see her eyes narrow at me, "And how did things go?"  
“哦，原来如此。”她放下物品，我看到她的眼神变得锐利起来，“那情况怎么样？”

"I think... That they went well." I answer her, I suppose I can leave out the latter part of the conversation for now and only focus on the main part, "I was able to explain to him a few things about myself, my upbringing and my... goals."  
"我觉得...他们进展得不错。" 我回答她，我想我可以暂时省略对话的后半部分，只关注主要内容，"我向他解释了一些关于我自己的事情，我的成长背景和我的...目标。"

"How did he take it?"  
"他怎么反应的？"

"He seemed to take it well, I think he was more prepared to hear about me this time. I still... did not feel comfortable admitting those things to him and I feel he was still not comfortable hearing them. Especially knowing that my goal was to manipulate him at first but... he seemed to understand my feelings were genuine after meeting him."  
"他似乎接受得很好，我想这次他更有准备来了解我。我仍然...不太愿意向他坦白这些事情，我感觉他听到这些还是不太自在。尤其是知道我最初的目标是操纵他，但...他似乎在见到我后理解了我的感情是真挚的。"

"Hah, I knew things would be alright. You guys just needed to speak. So, is that everything?"  
"哈哈，我就知道一切都会好起来的。你们只需要好好谈谈。那么，这就是全部了吗？"

I nod, "Yes, I think we can move forward now."  
我点头，“是的，我想我们现在可以向前看了。”

"Good." She looks back down at her phone as I move past her and pour myself a cup of coffee. I wonder if perhaps I should tell her now about the confession. She seems to be in a good mood and... maybe it would be best to tell her but if I do... what about Shinji? Surely, it's his place to tell her and I don't want her to be angry at him... not after them only just reconnecting soon.  
"很好。" 她再次低头看向手机，我经过她身边给自己倒了一杯咖啡。我在想是否应该现在告诉她那个告白。她看起来心情不错，而且……也许现在告诉她是最好的，但如果我这么做……那真嗣怎么办？按理说应该是他来告诉她，我不想她因为他而生气……毕竟他们才刚刚重新联系上不久。

I take my cup and wander back to the table and set it down, I run my hand along the chair for a moment contemplating my dilemma. What is the correct thing to do in this situation?  
我拿起杯子，漫步回到桌前放下，手沿着椅背抚过，一时陷入沉思。这种情况下，正确的做法是什么？

"You... aren't going to mention it then, are you?" Asuka suddenly says, without looking up from her phone. I feel myself tense up at her words, "Those things you spoke about after making friends again. Shinji told you all about what happened after you died, didn't he?"  
"你……不打算提那件事了，对吧？" 明日香突然说道，眼睛依旧盯着手机。听到她的话，我感到自己紧张起来，"你重新成为朋友后谈及的那些事。真嗣把你们死后发生的一切都告诉你了，对吧？"

My hands grip the chair tightly as she now fixes her eyes on me. I feel my mouth go dry and suddenly the coffee doesn't look quite so appealing. I nod at her, "Yes... Shinji told me."  
她的目光紧锁在我身上，我的手紧紧抓住椅子。我感到口干舌燥，突然间，那杯咖啡看起来不再那么诱人。我向她点头，"是的……真嗣告诉了我。"

**October 24th - Berlin – Asuka Langley Soryu  
10 月 24 日 - 柏林 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

It'll have to be me who mentioned the damn thing, won't it? The worst thing is I can see it there in his movements and expressions. I can see it's on the tip of his tongue but he just won't mention it. Never mind the elephant, this is the Evangelion in the room.  
看来又得我提这该死的事了，不是吗？最糟糕的是，我能从他的动作和表情中看出来。我能感觉到他几乎就要说出口了，但他就是不说。别提那头大象了，这是房间里的使徒。

I really don't want to talk about it. It'd be so easy to just try to forget about it again and hope that Kaworu can do the same. Would it be too much to ask that we both just blissfully ignore it? Of course, it would, it's out there now. Thanks a lot Shinji!  
我真的不想谈论这个。假装忘记它，并希望渚也能同样忘记，这该有多简单。我们能否愉快地忽视它呢？当然不行，它已经存在了。真是谢谢你啊，真嗣！

"You... aren't going to mention it then, are you?" I say it quickly and keep my gaze locked firmly on my phone. I can't meet his eyes just yet. "Those things you spoke about after making friends again. Shinji told you all about what happening after you died, didn't he?"  
"你...不会提起那件事的，对吧？" 我迅速说道，目光紧紧锁定在手机上。我还不敢直视他的眼睛。"那些你重新成为朋友后谈及的事情。真嗣把你们死后发生的一切都告诉你了，对吧？"

My hand tightens around my phone as I finally look up at him and lock my gaze onto his. I can see the worry spread across his face as he starts to grip the chair tightly. Your move Kaworu.  
我握紧手机，终于抬头直视他。我能看到他脸上担忧的神情，他开始紧紧抓住椅子。该你行动了，薰。

"Yes... Shinji told me." He finally admits as he looks back at me.  
"是的... 真嗣告诉我了。" 他终于承认，回望着我。

So now what do I do? What do we do? Do we talk about this like adults? Do I tell him my feelings on it? Ask him for his? Do I tell him how to feel? I don't even know what I want. I wanted the two of them to talk about their issues and resolve their problems. I didn't want Shinji to create a whole new one. We solve one problem and another one pops up immediately.  
那我现在该怎么办？我们该怎么办？我们像成年人一样讨论这件事吗？我要告诉他我的感受吗？问他自己的看法？我该告诉他该怎么感觉吗？我甚至不知道我想要什么。我希望他们俩能谈谈他们的问题并解决他们的麻烦。我不希望真嗣制造一个新的问题。我们解决了一个问题，另一个立刻就冒出来了。

"Everything?" I ask him, just to make sure that what Shinji said was correct.  
“所有事？”我问他，只是为了确认真嗣说的是对的。

Kaworu nods slowly, "About him... not helping you and also the hospital room. Yes."  
渚薰缓缓点头，“关于他不帮你还有医院房间的事。是的。”

My mouth goes dry as Kaworu confirms what he knows. I can hear his voice trembling slightly as he speaks. Whether it is with anger or not I don't know but I want to know. I need Kaworu to actually do something with this.  
当渚确认他所知道的事情时，我的嘴巴变得干燥。我能听到他的声音微微颤抖着说话。我不知道这是否出于愤怒，但我想要了解。我需要渚真的对此采取一些行动。

"And... what did you say to him?"  
“然后...你跟他说了什么？”

"I told him... that the best thing to do would be to speak to yourself about it. If this hurts him so much then only you can really help with that."  
“我告诉他...最好的办法是和你谈谈这件事。如果这让他如此痛苦，那么只有你才能真正帮助他。”

It's an answer I expected from Kaworu really. It's logical and probably what should happen, hell it is what will happen. When I said I'll deal with Shinji later I meant it, I'll speak to him and sort this out. What concerns me now is Kaworu. He's remaining calm, unnervingly so and I don't want that. I want his honestly.  
这确实是来自渚薰的回答，我早有预料。合乎逻辑，或许也是应该发生的，甚至可以说是必然发生的。当我提到稍后会处理真嗣的事情时，我是认真的，我会和他谈谈，解决这个问题。现在让我担忧的是渚薰。他保持着异常的冷静，这让我不安。我希望他能坦诚相待。

"How... do you feel about it?" I ask him.  
“你……对此有何感受？”我问他。

"I do not know..." He admits, "I think... considering my own life and deeds, it would be unfair for me to comment on what he did. It was a... fragile situation and I do not have any right to judge. I cannot judge him, if I had not done thing things I did then he would not ha-"  
“我不清楚……”他承认道，“考虑到我自己的生活和行为，我觉得对他所做的事情发表评论是不公平的。那是一个……脆弱的局面，我没有评判的权利。如果我没有做过那些事，他就不会……”

"Stop it" I cut him off sharply and try to not let myself get angry at what I've just heard. I shouldn't be surprised really, Kaworu is going to in some way take the blame for Shinji's actions. That's bullshit, it's just a convenient excuse so that Kaworu doesn't have to think about it too much. I try to probe further, "So, you're saying that it was your fault?"  
"住口" 我厉声打断他，努力不让自己的怒火因刚刚听到的话而燃起。其实我本不该惊讶，总有人会以某种方式将真嗣的行为归咎于渚薰。这简直是胡说八道，不过是个方便的借口，让渚薰不必过多思考。我试图进一步探究，"那么，你是说这是你的错吗？"

Kaworu looks back at me for a moment and I see him open his mouth to say something. Finally, he nods his head, "Yes..."  
渚薰回头看了我一会儿，我见他张嘴似乎要说些什么。最终，他点了点头，"是的..."

"Bullshit." "胡扯。"

"Asuka I..." "明日香，我..."

"Don't lie to me Kaworu."  
"别骗我，薰。"

"I'm not lying! I..." "我没撒谎！我..."

"Kaworu, I can tell when someone else is lying about something like this. I've been hiding behind masks and running away from stuff like this for most of my fucking miserable life, I know damn well when someone else is doing the same!"  
"カヲル、こういうことについて誰かが嘘をついているのは私にはわかるんだ。私はこんなことから逃げ回り、仮面をかぶって生きてきたんだ。誰かが同じようにしているのを見抜くのはうまいぞ！"

I wait for him to reply but all I get from him is a frustrated sigh. It's better than another bout of him blaming himself I suppose but not enough.  
彼の返事を待っているが、彼から得られるのは苛立ちをこめたため息だけだ。自分を責めるよりはマシだと思うが、十分ではない。

"Be honest with me Kaworu, do you really blame yourself for what he has done? Is what I had to suffer really your fault?"  
"カヲル、正直に言ってくれ、彼がしたことを本当に自分を責めているのか？私が耐えなければならなかったことが、本当にお前のせいなのか？"

He looks at me for a moment and I can see him thinking about it. Finally, he nods at me and I feel the anger and disappointment surge through me, "Yes... I... It was my fault, my presence..."  
他看了我一会儿，我能看出他在思考。最终，他向我点了点头，我感到愤怒和失望涌上心头，“是的……我……是我的错，我的存在……”

"No, it didn't!" I try not to yell back, "His actions were his own! He was to blame for it. Not you! Stop blaming yourself just because it's the easy thing to do. Stop hiding your own feelings on it just because it's the easy thing to do! Stop just accepting things because it's easy or because of your guilt!"  
“不，不是那样的！”我尽量不提高声音，“他的行为是他自己的！他应该为此负责。不是你！别因为这是最容易做的事就责怪自己。别因为这是最容易做的事就隐藏自己的感受！别只是因为容易或因为你的内疚就接受一切！”

"I-I'm not..." “我……我不是……”

"Yes you are! If I said I forgave Shinji then you'd just go along with it, you wouldn't even question me on it would you?"  
"是的，你就是！如果我说我原谅了真嗣，你只会随声附和，甚至不会质疑我，对吧？"

He shakes his head, "N-No I wouldn't... it is not my decision to make."  
他摇摇头，"不，我不会……这不是我能决定的。"

"And if I told him to go fuck himself outright then you'd just accept that as well wouldn't you?"  
"如果我直接让他滚蛋，你也会接受，不是吗？"

He nods, "Y-Yes... It is... your choice..."  
他点头，“是……是的……这是……你的选择……”

"Yes, it's my choice! It's my goddamn choice but it doesn't mean it's the right fucking choice does it? So you'd just let me make a mistake would you, you wouldn't try to stop me? You'd just accept my decision without even attempting anything."  
“是的，这是我的选择！这是我他妈的选择，但这并不意味着这是正确的选择，对吧？所以你就让我犯错，是吗？你不会试图阻止我？你会毫无尝试地接受我的决定。”

"It is not my place to-"  
“这不是我该……”

I slam my hand down against the table, "You're my boyfriend Kaworu! It is your place to fucking step in and tell me when I'm about to fuck up. You can't just accept everything I do without question just like I'm not going to let you fuck up your life either! Cut all of this crap, what the hell is it that you want? What do you think about it? Forget my goddamn feelings! What do you think?"  
我猛地一掌拍在桌子上，“你是我的男朋友，碇！你他妈的应该站出来，告诉我什么时候我要搞砸了。你不能就这样无条件接受我的一切，就像我不会让你毁掉你的生活一样！别再扯这些废话了，你到底想要什么？你怎么想的？别管我他妈的感受！你怎么想？”

"A-Asuka I..." His voice is trembling as he looks back at me in shock at my outburst. His face has fear and sadness written all over it but I'm not letting up.  
“A-明日香，我……”他的声音颤抖着，震惊地回头看着我，脸上写满了恐惧和悲伤，但我没有退让。

"I don't need you to just go along with everything I do! You're not my slave! You're not some fucking doll! Show a bit of backbone! Be your own person! I don't own you!"  
“我不需要你一味地顺从我！你不是我的奴隶！你不是什么该死的玩偶！拿出点骨气来！做你自己！我不拥有你！”

"I... I..." "我...我..."

I lock my eyes on him and watch as he scrambles for a response to my outburst. I can see him about to say something but the words seem to get caught in his throat. A part of me wants to push him further but I manage to fight it back. I already wonder if perhaps I've gone too far already. I can hear that voice in my head very clearly, speaking to me and warning me that this is it, the moment I push another good thing out of my life.  
我紧盯着他，看着他慌乱地寻找回应我爆发的话语。我能看到他似乎要说些什么，但那些话似乎卡在了喉咙里。一部分我想进一步逼迫他，但我努力克制住了。我已经开始怀疑自己是否已经做得太过分了。我脑海中那个声音非常清晰，对我说话，警告我这就是那个时刻，我将再次把一件好事推出我的生活。

I just... I can't stand this passiveness from him. I can't stand this guilt trip he's on. Hypocritical, I know. I blame myself for the way Shinji was as well, I blame myself for the world nearly ending. Kaworu is doing the same. How dare I, of all people tell him to stop, when I'm constantly berating myself for my own shitty actions?  
我只是...我无法忍受他的这种被动。我无法忍受他这种自责的情绪。我知道这是虚伪的。我也为自己对真嗣的影响以及世界几乎毁灭而自责，渚薰也在做同样的事。我怎么敢，作为我这样的人，告诉他停止，而我却一直在为我的糟糕行为自责？

Before I have a chance to stop myself more words have left my mouth, "Go on then Kaworu! Tell me how it makes you feel, tell me what you really want to do! Does it make you mad? Do you feel anything at all? Or do you just feel what I tell you to feel? Are you just some doll, waiting for a master or something else? Is that it? Do you just need a master?"  
在我有机会阻止自己之前，更多的话语已经脱口而出，“那就继续吧，渚薰！告诉我这让你有什么感觉，告诉我你真正想做什么！这让你生气吗？你有什么感觉吗？还是你只感受到我让你感受的？你只是个等待主人的玩偶，还是别的什么？是这样吗？你只是需要一个主人吗？”

I see him suddenly look up and something changes in his eyes. That was it, I went too far. It's not anger that I see but sadness. I watch as tears begin to well up in the corner of his eyes.  
我看到他突然抬起头，他的眼神中有什么东西变了。就是这样，我做得太过分了。我看到的不是愤怒，而是悲伤。我看着泪水开始在他的眼角涌出。

"A-Asuka I..." “A-明日香，我……”

He suddenly let's go of the chair and hurriedly moves around the table. I make no attempt to stop him and merely watch as he moves past me, wiping his eyes as he goes. I turn myself around and suddenly my mouth opens in horror as I see him take a step and get caught on one of my crutches.  
他突然松开椅子，急匆匆地绕过桌子。我没有试图阻止他，只是看着他擦着眼睛从我身边走过。我转过身，突然间惊恐地张大了嘴巴，只见他迈出一步，却被我的一个拐杖绊住了。

I call out his name as he stumbles forwards towards the counter. In my head I envision the worst, his head hitting the corner of the unit as he falls down and splitting up. Fortunately, reality is a bit kinder, he puts out a hand to stop himself and manages to do so, unfortunately also bringing the steaming coffee pot down with him. All I can do is watch as he hits the ground, the coffee pot smashing as it hits the ground near to him.  
我喊出他的名字，他踉跄着向前扑向柜台。在我脑海中，我预想到了最糟糕的情况，他的头撞在柜台的角落上，摔倒并裂开。幸运的是，现实稍微仁慈一些，他伸出一只手试图稳住自己，并成功了，但不幸的是，也把那壶冒着热气的咖啡一起带倒了。我只能眼睁睁地看着他摔在地上，咖啡壶在他附近摔得粉碎。

I see him roll onto his back, hissing in pain as he does so. I get to my feet leaning against my chair for support and look down at the scene. I watch as he struggles to get up. His hand twitching with pain near to the puddle of spilled coffee. I see the shards of glass littering the surrounding area. I see little specs of blood on his hand.  
我看到他翻身仰躺，疼得直吸气。我扶着椅子站起来，低头看着这一幕。我看着他挣扎着想要起身，他的手因疼痛在洒出的咖啡旁抽搐。我看到周围散落着玻璃碎片。我看到他手上沾着点点血迹。

I... I feel sick... 我...我感觉恶心...

My mouth opens and closes in silence as I do nothing but stare at him. He props himself up on one elbow looking up at me and I suddenly feel my body stiffen except for my hands which slowly make their way up to my throat where I feel a sudden tightening, almost as if someone is choking me. This scene... everything before me it... it's too close... too close to what happened.  
我张开嘴，却无声地闭上，只是呆呆地盯着他。他单肘撑起身体，抬头看着我，我突然感到身体僵硬，除了双手缓缓上移至喉咙，那里我感到一阵突如其来的紧缩，仿佛有人正掐着我。这一幕...眼前的一切...太接近...太接近那件事了。

My hands roam my neck feeling for the phantom hands that seem to be squeezing the life out of me. I sink to my knees as I gasp out an apology, "K-Kaworu... I... Sorry..."  
我的手在脖子上摸索，寻找着那双似乎正要掐死我的幻影之手。我跪倒在地，喘息着道歉，"K-Kaworu...我...对不起..."

I close my mouth as a wave of nausea rushes through me. All I can do now is watch, if I open my mouth I'll be sick. He slowly picks himself up, and looks at me, the sadness replaced by fear. At least I think its fear, my blurred vision making it hard to see it clearly. All I know is i can't breathe anymore, all I can feel is a tightening around my neck.  
我紧闭双唇，一阵恶心感涌上心头。现在我只能看着，如果张嘴我就会吐出来。他慢慢地站起身，看着我，悲伤已被恐惧取代。至少我认为那是恐惧，模糊的视线让我难以看清。我只知道我无法呼吸了，只感觉到脖子周围越来越紧。

Merely seconds later I slump forward as I hear him fearfully calling my name.  
仅仅几秒钟后，我向前倒下，听到他恐惧地呼唤我的名字。

**October 25th - Tokyo 2 – Shinji Ikari  
10 月 25 日 - 东京 2 - 碇真嗣**

I am... an idiot. That is the thought running through my head as Misato turns a corner and starts us on a path up the hillside. The thought is accompanied by a voice, Asuka's voice also telling me that I'm an idiot. Telling me that I'm stupid for what I've done and that all my words accomplished were hurting and confusing the matter more.  
我真是个...白痴。这个念头在我脑海中挥之不去，当美里转过一个弯，带着我们开始沿着山坡上行。这个念头伴随着一个声音，明日香的声音也在告诉我，我是个白痴。告诉我，我所做的一切是多么愚蠢，我的那些话只会让事情更加受伤和混乱。

I've been beating myself up about this since the phonecall to Asuka. I haven't heard anything back from her since. I don't know if I will and I can't blame her or Kaworu if they wish to have nothing to do with me again. I screwed things up once again. I've turned them against me all because I... I don't even know why.  
自从给明日香打电话以来，我一直在自责。自那以后，我再也没有收到她的任何消息。我不知道是否还会有，如果他们再也不想和我有任何瓜葛，我也不能怪他们或真嗣。我又一次搞砸了。我让他们都对我反感，只因为我...我甚至不知道为什么。

Why did I have to tell Kaworu about that? Why did I have to tell him then? What did I expect him to do, tell me everything was okay and then I'd feel better about it? That conversation... it should have been with Asuka first. She is the only one who can forgive me, she was the victim of my actions. So, it should have been her I went do.  
我为什么要告诉真嗣那件事？为什么非得在那时告诉他？我期望他能做什么，告诉我一切都好，然后我就会感觉好些吗？那次对话...本应该先和明日香谈的。她是唯一能原谅我的人，她是我的行为的受害者。所以，我本应该去找她。

I was told once, I think Misato said it to me, that I have a habit of trying to sabotage myself. That I'll sometimes try to protect myself from being hurt later by driving people away. I guess that is what I tried to do now. Maybe I was so scared of letting them into my lives and believing they really liked me that I had to give them a reason to leave so I wouldn't get hurt.  
我记得有一次，好像是美里对我说的，我有种自我破坏的习惯。说我有时会试图通过赶走别人来保护自己，以免将来受到伤害。我想我现在就是这么做的。也许我太害怕让他们进入我的生活，相信他们真的喜欢我，所以我必须给他们一个离开的理由，这样我就不会受伤了。

That might be it, but at the same time I feel like I did need to talk about it. It's weighed on my mind for so long but I've just gone about it the wrong way. I know Asuka told me many years ago to forget about anything that happened just before Third Impact, that all is forgiven but she was different then and hiding as well. I guess I need to know if I am truly forgiven.  
可能是这样，但同时我觉得我真的需要谈谈这件事。它在我心里压了很久，但我处理的方式一直不对。我知道明日香多年前就告诉过我，要忘记第三次冲击前发生的一切，一切都已原谅，但那时她也不一样，也在隐藏自己。我想我需要知道我是否真的被原谅了。

"Something on your mind Shinji, you've been quiet this whole journey?"  
“心里有事吗，真嗣？这一路上你都很安静。”

Misato's words pull me from my thoughts and I turn to face her, "I'm okay just thinking."  
美里的话将我从思绪中拉回，我转向她，“我只是想了想，没事的。”

I look around us as Misato brings the car to a halt. We are far from the heart of the city I'm used to, we're now up in the hills looking down on the town of Tokyo-2. I can see the vast maze of streets and tall buildings off in the distance. It feels peaceful up here, in fact, I've come up into the hills a few times to just relax. I don't mind being in the city but up here, it's not as claustrophobic, it's calm and gives me some perspective.  
美里将车停下，我环顾四周。这里远离了我熟悉的市中心，我们此刻正位于山丘之上，俯瞰着东京-2 的城镇。远处是错综复杂的街道和林立的高楼。站在这里，感觉宁静祥和，事实上，我也曾几次上山来放松心情。虽然我不介意城市生活，但在这里，没有那种压抑感，宁静且能让人心境开阔。

This time is different though. I'm not here to relax or find perspective. We haven't come to the area I'm used to, instead we've come to that area I've avoided. The small group of houses that were built for the elite. Large mansions with swimming pools, tennis courts and a vast number of bedrooms in each one.  
但这次不同。我不是来放松或寻找视角的。我们没有来到我熟悉的地方，相反，我们来到了我一直避开的区域。那些为精英阶层建造的小型住宅群。每座都是带有游泳池、网球场和众多卧室的宏伟庄园。

"It's really something isn't it." Misato remarks with a smile.  
"这真是了不起，不是吗？" 美里微笑着说道。

"Yeah... it is..." I nod, "Which one does he live in."  
"是啊...确实..." 我点头，"他住在哪一栋？"

Misato points out the home directly opposite us. It's probably the smallest of the mansions up here but it's still a large home. I'm fairly sure you'd be able to fit most of our apartment block on its grounds and have room to spare.  
美里指向我们正对面的那栋房子。它可能是这里最小的豪宅，但仍然非常宽敞。我敢肯定，它的地盘足以容纳我们整个公寓楼，还绰绰有余。

"You know Shinji, you really didn't have to come and do this." She comments, "After the way he spoke to you, you don't owe him anything. Even now, if you want to wait in the car, you can do so."  
"你知道吗，真嗣，你真的不必来这里做这些。" 她评论道，"他那样对你说话之后，你并不欠他什么。即使现在，如果你想在车里等，你也可以这么做。"

I shake my head at Misato. I understand what she is saying but this... feels like the right thing to do. Also after what I did yesterday I guess I could do with some form of distraction today, "I know that but... I want to. I want to find out why he was that way and... apologizes on beha-"  
我对美里摇了摇头。我明白她在说什么，但这件事... 感觉是对的。而且，经历了昨天的事情后，我想今天我需要一些形式的分散注意力，"我知道，但是... 我想这么做。我想弄清楚他为什么会那样，并且... 代表他道歉..."

"Hey!" Misato cuts me off sharply, "Don't you dare think about apologizing, not for yourself, not for anything else and especially not on behalf of your father. You are not responsible for his or anyone elses actions."  
"嘿！" 美里突然打断我，"你可千万别想着道歉，不是为你自己，也不是为其他任何事，更不是代表你父亲。你不需要为他和任何其他人的行为负责。"

I nod my head, I know she is right and yet, I still protest, "But I-"  
我点点头，我知道她是对的，然而我还是反驳道，“但是我——”

"No! No buts! He is the one who should be apologizing to you and Asuka for the things he said. He was the one who was unable to get over his petty grudges. He shouldn't have been anywhere near that meeting, they have even admitted as much themselves."  
“不！没有但是！他才是应该向你和明日香道歉的人，因为他说的那些话。他才是那个无法放下小怨恨的人。他根本就不该出现在那个会议上，他们自己也承认了这一点。”

"So why was he?" “那他为什么会在那里？”

Misato shrugs, "I don't know, I guess he didn't act like this in front of them and by the time the meetings happened. So, by that point they couldn't do anything about it."  
美里耸耸肩，“我不知道，我猜他没在他们面前这样表现过，而且到了开会的时候。所以，那时候他们也无能为力了。”

I nod my head, "I... I'll try. What are you going to say to him then?"  
我点点头，“我……我会试试。那你打算对他说什么呢？”

Misato pauses for a moment, lets out a sigh and then I see a dry smile come to her lips, "I'm going to apologize to him, for the Jet Alone incident."  
美里停顿了一下，叹了口气，然后我看到她的嘴角露出一丝干涩的微笑，“我要向他道歉，为杰特·阿隆事件。”

I raise an eyebrow and glare at her, "I thought you said no apologizing."  
我挑了挑眉，瞪着她，“我记得你说过不许道歉的。”

She turns to me, "Yeah, well some people, like me, hold positions of power within government organizations and have to suck up as part of their job. I'm not happy with it either but if it means I and WILLE can operate properly, and if it means you and your friends are helped out then I'll suck up. You on the other hand are under strict orders to not apologize, understood?"  
她转向我，“是啊，但有些人，比如我，在政府机构中担任有权力的职位，工作中不得不拍马屁。我也不喜欢这样，但如果这意味着我和 WILLE 能正常运作，如果这意味着你和你的朋友们能得到帮助，那我就忍了。而你，则被严格命令不许道歉，明白吗？”

"Um... Misato... You're not my commanding officer anymore." I remind her, half smiling as I do, "So you can't give me orders."  
“呃... 美里... 你已经不是我的指挥官了。”我提醒她，半笑着说，“所以你不能给我下命令。”

She contemplated it for a second before grinning, "Okay well... As your mother, I'm telling you to not apologize, that better, and you can't debate that one. I have all the paperwork."  
她沉思了一会儿，然后咧嘴笑道：“好吧……作为你的母亲，我告诉你不要道歉，这样更好，你不能反驳这一点。我有所有的文件。”

I can't argue with that so I just nod, "Okay, got it, mom."  
我无法反驳，只能点头，“好的，明白了，妈妈。”

We both exit the car and I take a moment to straight my shirt. I feel a little bit bad that I haven't told MIsato about what happened yesterday but I figure just telling Kaworu might have done enough damage.  
我们俩都下了车，我整理了一下衬衫。我有点内疚还没告诉美里昨天发生的事，但我想告诉渚可能已经造成了足够的伤害。

I keep on thinking about this idea of sabotaging myself. Is that really what I do, is that really me trying to protect myself? Push people away so they can't hurt me later... What a horrible thought. I don't want to push people away. I want them in my life but I know I don't want to be hurt too.  
我一直在想这个自我破坏的想法。那真的是我在保护自己吗？推开别人，以免他们日后伤害我……多么可怕的想法。我不想推开别人。我希望他们在我生活中，但我知道我也不想受到伤害。

"You know, you didn't tell me how things went yesterday." Misato suddenly speaks, "Did things go okay?"  
“你知道吗，你昨天没告诉我事情进展如何。”美里突然说道，“一切还顺利吗？”

I turn to her, surprised that she'd ask me about that. I nod, "I... I think so. Kaworu told me a lot about himself, why he did what he did and... who he is..."  
我转向她，惊讶她会问起这个。我点点头，“我……我想是的。卡萝告诉了我很多关于他自己的事，他为什么那样做，以及……他是谁……”

"So... have you forgiven him now?" She asks me, and I see her eyes narrow with some suspicion.  
"那么...你现在原谅他了吗？" 她问我，我看到她的眼睛带着几分怀疑眯了起来。

"I... I think I can." I admit, "It's difficult, I... think about what he did and it hurt me so much but... now I know a bit more about him I understand it a bit more. Sorry... I know you don't like him."  
"我...我想我可以。" 我承认，"这很难，我...想到他所做的事，我感到非常痛苦，但现在我对他有了更多的了解，我更能理解了。对不起...我知道你不喜欢他。"

She shakes her head, "What I think about Nagisa doesn't matter. I told you I would support you in the decisions you made and I'm going to do that. If you want the truth, no, I don't like Nagisa and I don't know if I could forgive him but... what is my fault and not yours."  
她摇了摇头，"我对渚的看法并不重要。我告诉过你，我会支持你所做的决定，我会做到的。如果你想知道真相，不，我不喜欢渚，我不知道我是否能原谅他，但...这是我的问题，不是你的。"

I lower my gaze, "Yeah..."  
我垂下目光，“嗯……”

"I went so many years dealing with what I saw in the Antarctic and the loss of my father. I hated the Angels because I thought they took away my one chance of making up with my father. I don't know how he truly felt about me, I don't know if we could have had a relationship because of them." She continues, "I was so cold towards him, not that he was a perfect father either but that could have been mended. After Second Impact I spent so long swearing revenge on the Angels and hating them. It's hard to get away from that."  
“我在南极经历了那么多，失去了父亲。我恨天使们，因为我觉得是他们夺走了我与父亲和解的唯一机会。我不了解他对我真正的感受，也不知道我们是否能建立关系，都是因为他们。”她继续说道，“我对他的态度一直很冷淡，虽然他也不是完美的父亲，但那本可以修复。第二次冲击后，我花了很长时间发誓要向天使们复仇，恨透了他们。要摆脱这种情绪真的很难。”

"I'm sorry... I..." “对不起……我……”

"But I have to trust the facts and I have to trust you. Nagisa's humanity has been confirmed multiple times, he has expressed regret for his actions and both his story and the evidence points to him as being a victim of SEELEs actions too. Whilst it is true he could have done so many things differently... we all could have done."  
"但我必须相信事实，也必须相信你。渚的人性已被多次证实，他对自己的行为表示了悔意，他的故事和证据都指向他同样是 SEELE 行动的受害者。虽然他的确可能有许多不同的做法...我们所有人都有可能做得更好。"

"Yeah... I think... I understand."  
"嗯...我想...我明白了。"

"Look, we can talk about this later. For today let's deal with Tokita, okay?"  
"听着，我们稍后再讨论这个。今天我们先处理 Tokita 的事情，好吗？"

I nod as we move towards the front gate and my nerves start to kick him. I still don't really know what this is about but I want to see it through.  
我点头，随着我们走向前门，我的神经开始紧绷。我仍然不太清楚这是怎么回事，但我想要坚持到底。

**October 25th - Berlin – Asuka Langley Soryu  
10 月 25 日 - 柏林 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I let out a soft groan as I slowly open my eyes to find myself in our dimly lit bedroom. I remain still for a few moments, facing up at the ceiling, waiting for this dizziness to cease before I sit myself up and try to remember what happened. I feel a sharp pang in the pit of my stomach, the argument... we argued, for the first proper time since getting together.  
我轻轻地呻吟了一声，缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己躺在我们昏暗的卧室里。我静静地躺了几分钟，面朝天花板，等待这阵眩晕过去，然后才坐起身来，试图回忆发生了什么。我感到胃部一阵剧痛，是那场争吵……我们争吵了，自从在一起后第一次真正意义上的争吵。

I suppose it was bound to happen eventually but I... I said some bad things to him. I upset him and nearly made him leave. He would have left if he hadn't have fallen over my damn crutches and then... then 'that' happened. The last thing I remember before I passed out.  
我想这迟早会发生，但我...我对他说了些不好的话。我让他难过，差点让他离开。如果不是他绊倒在我的该死的拐杖上，然后...然后‘那件事’发生了。我失去意识前最后的记忆。

I suppose I can take some solace in the fact that I'm in our bedroom and not in a hospital room. That makes me feel ever so slightly better.  
我想我可以从自己躺在我们的卧室而不是医院病房这一事实中找到一些安慰。这让我感觉稍微好一点。

My thoughts are interrupted by a soft snore coming from down near my feet and I suddenly notice the weight on the bed near to my legs. I shift myself to see a mess of silvery hair, Kaworu is kneeling down by the side of the bed, his head on the matress and facing away from me and he's actually asleep. The idiot must have been watching over me and fallen asleep, couldn't he have just gotten into the bed with me?  
我的思绪被脚边传来的轻微鼾声打断，我突然注意到床边靠近我腿部的重量。我挪动身体去看，只见一团银色头发，渚薰跪在床边，头枕在床垫上，背对着我，他竟然睡着了。这个傻瓜一定是守着我睡着了，他为什么不直接上床和我一起睡呢？

The memories of the argument come rushing back to me, I suppose he couldn't have done. We weren't exactly civil towards one another, were we? Or at least, I wasn't civil towards him. What was it I was doing? Yelling at him because he couldn't tell me about what Shinji had said. Calling him out because he just seemed to accept anything bad in his life.  
那场争吵的记忆突然涌回心头，我想他不可能没感觉。我们当时并不算友好相处，对吧？至少，我对他是没好气的。我当时在做什么呢？冲他大吼，因为他不肯告诉我真嗣说了什么。指责他，因为他似乎对生活中的坏事逆来顺受。

Even as I think about it now I can feel some of that annoyance coming back to me. That passiveness within him... I really can't stand it. I can't stand it because I know it'll only serve to hurt him. I know that the day will come where I or someone else won't be in the area to fight for him.  
即便现在回想起来，我仍能感受到那种恼怒再次袭来。他那种消极的态度……我真的无法忍受。我无法忍受，因为我知道这只会伤害到他。我知道总有一天，我或其他人不会在他身边为他抗争。

Still... I went a bit too far. I brought up things that weren't nice. I guess I should apologize. I shift myself up and let the duvet fall from me as I prod him in the back of the head. He lets out a moan and slowly looks up. His expression one of confusion as he turns to look at me, "A-Asuka... You're awake!"  
尽管如此……我做得有些过火了。我提到了一些不愉快的事情。我想我应该道歉。我挪动身体，让被子从身上滑落，轻轻戳了戳他的后脑勺。他发出一声呻吟，慢慢抬起头。他的表情带着困惑，转头看向我，“A-明日香……你醒了！”

I nod my head, "Somewhat..."  
我点点头，“有点……”

"I-I was so worried... You... You collapsed and I wasn't sure what to do. I... I know you hate hospitals so I didn't want to call an ambulance but I had to do something so I..." He hands his head, "I'm sorry, I called Fuyutsuki instead..."  
“我……我很担心……你……你突然倒下了，我不知道该怎么办。我……我知道你讨厌医院，所以不想叫救护车，但我必须做点什么，所以……”他抱住头，“对不起，我给冬月打了电话……”

"Ah..." I nod, I suppose it is better than him calling an ambulance, "What did the old man have to say?"  
“啊……”我点点头，比起叫救护车，这似乎是个更好的选择，“那老头怎么说？”

"Nothing really... he helped me get you into bed and clean up a bit. He took a look at my hands too." Kaworu holds up his hands, in the dim light I can make up a bandage around one of them. I feel a wave of guilt wash over me.  
“没什么……他帮我把你弄到床上，还稍微清理了一下。他也看了看我的手。” 薰举起手，在昏暗的光线下我能看到其中一个手上有绷带。我感到一阵内疚涌上心头。

"You... weren't hurt, were you?"  
“你……没受伤吧？”

He shakes his head, "I... burnt my leg a bit and a few cuts here and there but I'm fine. Fuyutsuki... I think he fears something bad had happened but I told him what had happened... I said we had an argument and I went to leave. I told him I tripped and fell and knocked the coffee pot over..."  
他摇摇头，“我……腿上有点烧伤，还有几处擦伤，但我没事。副校长……我觉得他担心发生了什么不好的事，但我告诉他发生了什么……我说我们吵了一架，我打算离开。我告诉他我不小心绊倒了，打翻了咖啡壶……”

"Did you tell him what happened to me?"  
"你告诉他我发生了什么事吗？"

Kaworu nods, "Yes... I... Didn't know if you would have wanted me to but... I thought it'd be best to tell him the truth. I told him you seemed to go into shock and passed out."  
渚薰点头，“是的……我……不知道你是否希望我这么做，但……我觉得告诉他真相是最好的。我告诉他你似乎受到了惊吓，然后昏倒了。”

Yeah..." I avert my eyes from him as I recall what triggered my episode. It was all just so similar to what I had seen years ago. Me being angry, the body on the floor, the coffee and the shards of glass. It was almost the same.  
"是啊……" 我避开他的目光，回想起触发我那次发作的原因。一切都和多年前的那一幕太相似了。我生气，地板上的身体，咖啡和碎玻璃。几乎一模一样。

"Asuka... what happened?" Kaworu asks me, as I turn on the bedside light. I see him looking at me, his eyes full of concern.  
"明日香...发生了什么？" 真嗣问我，我打开了床头灯。我看到他正看着我，眼里满是关切。

"Nothing." I answer him, "Just... forget about it for now Kaworu."  
"没什么。" 我回答他，"只是...现在先别管了，真嗣。"

"No!" He answers me sternly which actually surprises me. I look back at him as he reaches for my hand, "You could have been hurt Asuka. If I hadn't have caught you in time you could have ended up falling onto the glass or hitting your head off of something. I'm not going to forget about it, what happened?"  
"不行！" 他严肃地回答，这让我有些惊讶。我回头看他，他伸手握住我的手，"你可能会受伤的，明日香。如果我没有及时接住你，你可能会摔在玻璃上或者撞到头。我不会忘记这件事的，到底发生了什么？"

I allow myself to smile, "So... you pick now of all times to become more assertive..."  
我允许自己微笑，“所以……你偏偏选在这个时候变得更坚定……”

"Asuka... I was scared, I... I didn't want to lose you."  
“明日香……我害怕，我……我不想失去你。”

"Idiot! You're not going to lose me!" I let out another sigh as he squeezes my hand, "I guess... seeing as I expect you to open up then it's only fair that I do as well. I want you to promise me something though, promise me that you're going to be honest with me about your feelings, no hiding... okay?"  
“笨蛋！你不会失去我的！”我再次叹息，他紧握我的手，“我想……既然我希望你能敞开心扉，那么我也应该公平地这样做。不过，我想要你答应我一件事，答应我你会诚实地向我表达你的感受，不隐瞒……好吗？”

He nods, "I... I'll try..."  
他点点头，“我……我会试试……”

"Good." I nod back at him as I try to work out how to tell him this. I'm not sure I even understand what happened all of years ago myself, so how am I supposed to explain the damn thing. Maybe I could fake falling back to sleep and get away from this. No, that's not going to work. Guess I just have to bit the bullet and go for it.  
“很好。”我朝他点头回应，同时努力思考如何告诉他这件事。我自己都不确定多年前究竟发生了什么，又该如何解释清楚。也许我可以假装再次入睡然后逃避这个问题。不，那行不通。看来我只能硬着头皮上了。

"When you fell I... remembered something." I begin to explain, "It was... something I had tried to bury many years ago. In truth... I don't even know if it really happened... my memories of that time are a little bit muddled up, I suppose dying will do that to you."  
“你摔倒时，我……想起了一些事。”我开始解释，“那是……多年前我试图埋藏的记忆。实际上……我甚至不确定它是否真的发生过……那段时间的记忆有些混乱，我想死亡会让人如此。”

"Dying?" Kaworu looks back at me confused by me statement.  
"死？" 渚薰回头看着我，对我的话感到困惑。

I simply nod again, "Yeah... I died, remember? I suppose this memory is just after I died and Third Impact started. In fact... yeah, that's where it's from, the cusp of Instrumentality."  
我只是再次点头，"是的...我死了，记得吗？我想这段记忆应该是在我死后，第三次冲击开始的时候。实际上...没错，就是那个时刻，人类补完计划的边缘。"

Kaworu just looks more confused by what I've said, "I see but... I don't understand. Fuyutsuki and Kodama told me people weren't able to remember what happened to them during Instrumentality. I... I have no memory myself of that time."  
渚薰听了我的话显得更加困惑，"我明白了，但是...我不理解。冬月和桐山告诉我，人们在人类补完期间无法记得发生了什么。我...我自己也没有那段时间的记忆。"

"Well... I guess I'm just special, aren't I?" I answer him, "Look, I know all of that but I... I can remember it. I don't know why, maybe it's because I was so close the impact but I can. Do you want to hear it or not?"  
"嗯...我想我只是特别，不是吗？" 我回答他，"听着，我知道所有那些，但我...我能记得。我不知道为什么，也许是因为我离撞击太近了，但我能。你想听还是不想听？"

Kaworu nods, "Yes." 渚薰点头，"是的。"

"Good." I adjust the pillows behind me to get more comfortable, "I don't know why but it was back at Misato's apartment. I think maybe it was Shinji attempting to reach out to me, a final attempt to get my help. I was sat down in the kitchen not too differently to how I was earlier. Shinji... kept on telling me how much he wanted to help me."  
"很好。" 我调整了背后的枕头让自己更舒服些，"我不知道为什么，但那是在美里小姐的公寓里。我想可能是真嗣试图向我伸出援手，最后一次尝试寻求我的帮助。我坐在厨房里，和之前差不多。真嗣...一直在告诉我他有多想帮助我。"

"This was after..." Kaworu begins to ask but doesn't finish the question.  
"这是在那之后..." 渚薰开始询问，但没有把问题说完。

"Yes, it was after he had done that... and worse to the point it was a moment after I had found out about it. Again, not sure why but it was there I knew that he had done it and I knew that he had left me to die. Suffice to say I was not in a pleasant mood. All I felt was anger at him and how he had acted. I had needed his help moments before and he had done nothing and he had actually violated me moment before."  
"是的，那是在他做了那件事之后...甚至更糟，直到我发现这一切的那一刻。再次，不确定为什么，但我知道他做了那件事，我知道他让我等死。可以说，我当时心情非常糟糕。我感到的只有对他的愤怒和他当时的所作所为。我之前需要他的帮助，他却什么都没做，实际上在那之前他还侵犯了我。"

I feel Kaworu squeeze my hand tightly as I say the last part. I watch his face and see his eyes flash for a moment as he frowns. I give him a moment before he speaks, his voice barely above a whisper, "What happened?"  
当我提到最后一部分时，我感觉到渚薰紧紧握住了我的手。我看着他的脸，看到他的眼睛闪烁了一下，然后皱起了眉头。我给他一点时间，然后他开口了，声音几乎低不可闻，"发生了什么？"

"What do you think? I let him have it." I almost laugh, "I told him that all he was doing was running from person to person to try to get help for himself. I asked him how he could ever expect someone to love him when he couldn't even love himself. I called him out on what he was doing. He didn't want to help me, he just wanted me to help him and make him feel better. Then I put my hands on him, I shoved him to the floor."  
"你觉得呢？我让他尝到了苦头。" 我差点笑出声，"我告诉他，他只是在从一个地方跑到另一个地方，试图为自己寻求帮助。我问他，当他连自己都不爱时，怎么能期望别人爱他。我揭穿了他的所作所为。他不是想帮我，只是想让我帮他，让他感觉好些。然后我把手放在他身上，把他推倒在地。"

"You... shoved him?" "你...推倒了他？"

"Yes." I state, "As he went down he took out the table leg and make an episode of it. The coffee pot landed next to him and he just... sat there hissing in pain. A part of me wanted to help him up, apologize and try to move out of that hell but there was the louder part of me, the part that was sick of it all, that was sick of him, Misato, the world and sick of me that wanted me to push further. That part won... I just stood over his body and called him pathetic."  
"是的。" 我陈述道，"他倒下时撞到了桌腿，还顺势演了一出戏。咖啡壶落在他旁边，他就那样...坐在那里痛苦地嘶嘶作声。我的一部分想扶他起来，道歉并试图逃离那个地狱，但更强烈的那部分我，那个厌倦了一切、厌倦了他、美里、这个世界和我自己的我，想要进一步推动事态。那部分赢了...我只是站在他的身体上方，称他为可怜虫。"

Kaworu shifts, looking slightly uncomfortable by my words. I can't blame him, I'm not comfortable knowing that I have that within me either.  
渚薰挪动了一下，我的话让他显得有些不自在。我不能怪他，我自己也不舒服，知道我体内有那种东西。

"What happened next?" “接下来发生了什么？”

"I saw the change in him when I said that and I saw as the last part of Shinji, the real Shinji, had just been pushed out of him." I explain as my voice darkens, "I was so proud of myself, finally... I was going to get what I wanted. He got up, he staggered for a moment and I saw no life in his eyes... he went for me. His hands clamped themselves around my throat and I let it happen. I didn't fight him..."  
“我说那话时，我看到了他的变化，我看到真嗣的最后一部分，真正的真嗣，刚刚被他推了出去。”我解释道，声音变得低沉，“我为自己感到骄傲，终于……我就要得到我想要的了。他站了起来，踉跄了一下，我看到他眼中没有一丝生机……他向我扑来。他的双手紧紧掐住我的脖子，我任由他这么做。我没有反抗他……”

"You... let it happen?" "你... 让它发生了？"

I nod, "I let him squeeze what life there was left within me. All I could think was, 'Good, kill me, finish my pathetic life off. I don't care anymore. I don't care about this myself, I don't care about you or this world."  
我点点头，"我让他榨取我体内仅存的生命。我满脑子想的都是，'好，杀了我，结束我这可悲的生命。我不在乎了。我不在乎自己，不在乎你，也不在乎这个世界。"

"Asuka..." Kaworu suddenly gets to his feet and sits himself on the edge of the bed, drawing me into a hug. I can feel tears stinging in my eyes as I recount my story. I blink them away, determined to not cry until I'm done.  
"明日香..." 渚薰突然站起身，坐在床边，把我拥入怀中。我讲述着自己的故事，泪水在眼眶中打转。我眨了眨眼，决心在讲完之前不让自己哭出来。

"It was only a moment before things went black that I realized I had made a mistake. Fortunately, all I had done was force him to trigger Instrumentality." I laugh, as if that was something to be proud of, "I... I got to see my mother, I saw a few other things and I pleaded... I pleaded and begged to be sent back, to be allowed to live my life again and fix my fuck ups but they wouldn't let me. Shinji had been handed the keys, I had been given my chance and fucked it up."  
"就在一切陷入黑暗的前一刻，我才意识到自己犯了个错误。幸运的是，我所做的不过是迫使他启动了人类补完计划。" 我笑了起来，仿佛这是件值得骄傲的事，"我... 我见到了我的母亲，看到了一些其他的东西，我恳求... 我恳求并乞求能被送回来，能被允许重新活一次，修复我的错误，但他们不让我这么做。真嗣已经拿到了钥匙，我得到了机会却搞砸了。"

"Asuka, you weren't to bla..."  
"明日香，你不是要..."

"Stop it, I know what you're going to say..." I interrupt him, "I wasn't to blame for Instrumentality? I had no way of knowing? I've heard it all before, from myself and from Rei. I know that but... it doesn't make me feel any better. We were on the brink Kaworu, the goddamn brink because of me! I was close to being the catalyst for the end of all humanity, do you know how that feels?"  
"别说了，我知道你要说什么..." 我打断了他，"我不是因为人类补完计划而受到责备？我无法预知？这些话我以前都听过，从我自己和丽那里。我知道这些，但是... 这并没有让我感觉好一点。我们差点就因为我的原因而走向了末日，卡沃鲁，差点就因为我的原因而终结了全人类！你知道那是什么感觉吗？"

Kaworu looks at me blankly for a moment and I stare back awaiting a response. Suddenly it dawns on me exactly what I've just asked him, it dawns on me who I'm speaking to. He shrugs at me and gives me a slight embarrassed smile, "No, I don't. Please do tell me."  
渚薰面无表情地看了我一会儿，我回望着他，等待着回应。突然间，我意识到自己刚刚问了他什么，意识到我在和谁说话。他耸了耸肩，给了我一个略带尴尬的微笑，“不，我不知道。请告诉我吧。”

"Oh shut up!" I punch him playfully on the arm, "I guess my point was the kitchen thing it was just… really similar. It brought it all back. All those things I've tried to suppress for five years. All those things I've tried to run away from. I knew they needed to be confronted but just… not like this. If only I… had put that crutch in a better place!"  
“哦，闭嘴！”我开玩笑地捶了一下他的手臂，“我想我的意思是厨房那件事，它只是……真的很相似。它让我想起了所有这些我试图压抑五年的事情。所有这些我试图逃避的事情。我知道它们需要被面对，只是……不是以这种方式。如果我……能把那根拐杖放好一点就好了！”

Kaworu smiles and shakes his head, "It wasn't your fault Asuka. I was the one who tried to rush out of the room and… well you have seen how clumsy I can be. What happened was an accident."  
渚薰微笑着摇了摇头，“这不是你的错，明日香。是我试图匆忙离开房间，而且……你也看到了我有多笨拙。发生的事情是个意外。”

"You weren't hurt too badly, were you?" I ask him as I rub his hand gently and guiltily look down at his bandaged hand.  
"你没受太重的伤吧？" 我一边轻柔地揉着他的手，一边愧疚地低头看着他包扎好的手。

"A few cuts on my hand but nothing too serious. Fuyutsuki took a good look at it, cleaned the wound and bandaged me up. It could have been a lot worse… for both of us." He lowers his gaze for a moment, "I… am sorry for not opening up to you properly about my feelings. I have had… some time to think about the things you said…"  
"手上有些划伤，但没什么大碍。冬月仔细检查了一番，清理了伤口并帮我包扎好了。情况本可能更糟……对我们俩都是。" 他垂下目光片刻，"我……为没有好好向你坦白我的感受而道歉。我花了一些时间思考你说过的话……"

"Kaworu." I cut him off quickly, "I was unfair to you, the things I said were… harsh."  
"薰。" 我迅速打断他，"我对你不公平，我说的话……太刻薄了。"

He shakes his head, "Perhaps, but also accurate. I have been over the last few months hiding my feelings on certain things that affect me negatively. It was not fair on you and it is not fair on myself. I… need to learn to not do this."  
他摇了摇头，“或许吧，但也确实。过去几个月里，我一直隐藏着某些对我产生负面影响的事情的感受。这对你是种不公平，对自己也是。我……需要学会不再这样做。”

"Still, I should not have been as harsh with you. What Shinji did, springing this on us like that it… didn't put me in a good place but there was no need for what I said. I just… want you to be honest with your feelings…" I trail off for a moment, "I know that's rich coming from me but…"  
“尽管如此，我不该对你那么严厉。真嗣那样突然把事情抛给我们……确实让我处境不佳，但我说的那些话没有必要。我只是……希望你能坦诚面对自己的感受……”我顿了一下，“我知道这话从我嘴里说出来很讽刺，但是……”

"I understand." Kaworu nods at me once again, "I will try to do so. It is just… frightening for me."  
“我明白。”渚薰再次向我点头，“我会努力这样做。只是……对我来说很可怕。”

"What are you scared of?" As if I need to ask him that.  
"你在害怕什么？" 仿佛我还需要问他这个问题。

"Losing you… losing the life I've grown comfortable living." He lets out a sigh, "Not being able to be me any longer. I feel like I have to accept things that happen to me, I have to accept things as they are otherwise I lose everything I have."  
"失去你……失去我已经习惯的生活。" 他叹了口气，"不能再做我自己了。我觉得我必须接受发生在我身上的事，我必须接受现实，否则我会失去我所拥有的一切。"

"You know that won't happen though." I try to reassure him.  
"你知道那不会发生的。" 我试图安慰他。

"That's the thing Asuka… I don't." He answers, "I don't know anything. Everything I have has been gifted to me. I was found on a beach in Japan at the start of this year with no knowledge of how to live. I didn't know how to find a job, I still don't. I didn't know how to cook for myself, I didn't know how to fend for myself, I didn't even know how to buy things for myself. Without Kodama, Fuyutsuki and you I'd be useless. Even then I'm here because other people allow me to be, at the click of someone's fingers I could be sent to some prison or… worse."  
"这就是问题所在，Asuka……我不懂。" 他回答道，"我一无所知。我所拥有的一切都是别人赐予的。今年初，我在日本的一个海滩上被发现，对如何生活毫无记忆。我不知道如何找工作，现在依然不懂。我不知道如何自己做饭，不知道如何自力更生，甚至不知道如何为自己购物。没有 Kodama、Fuyutsuki 和你，我毫无用处。即便如此，我能在这里也是因为别人允许，只需某人一声令下，我可能就会被送进监狱，甚至……更糟。"

"Kaworu, that won't happen!" I answer him.  
"Kaworu，那不会发生的！" 我回答他。"

He nods, "Logically I know that. I know that so much but… I'm so scared it will. I'm so scared that if I don't just bow down and accept what happens to me then they'll just take it all away. I'm scared that if I don't just go along with what happened I'll lose people close to me. I don't… want that."  
他点头，"从逻辑上我知道那不会发生。我明白很多事情，但是……我非常害怕它会成真。我害怕如果不低头接受命运的安排，他们就会夺走一切。我害怕如果我不顺从发生的事情，我会失去亲近的人。我不……希望那样。"

The emotion I wasn't hearing before it's there now, clear as day in his voice. The pain and anguish, the fear that I thought was lacking, it's there and so recognizable. I reach up with a hand to cup his cheek, "You fear people will just up and abandon you, right?"  
那份我之前未曾察觉的情感，如今在他的声音中清晰如昼。痛苦与绝望，那我以为缺失的恐惧，此刻如此明显且可辨。我伸手用掌心轻抚他的脸颊，“你害怕人们会突然离你而去，对吗？”

He nods, "Yes, I suppose it's maybe more than that. I was never supposed to live this life. I was not supposed to die five years ago and stay dead. People… aren't normally given a second chance, I'm unique in that."  
他点头，“是的，我想这或许不止于此。我本不该过这样的生活。五年前我本该死去并长眠。人们……通常不会得到第二次机会，在这点上我是独一无二的。”

I shrug, "Well I mean, there is me… and Rei… and Misato I guess, but sure, you're unique."  
我耸耸肩，“好吧，我的意思是，还有我……和丽……以及美里，不过没错，你是特别的。”

He laughs, "Point taken, I just… feel I am more fortunate because of what I was."  
他笑道，“说得对，我只是……觉得因为我的出身，我更幸运一些。”

"You're not fortunate Kaworu! You have what anyone should be entitled to have!" I answer back, "You were a victim of all of that too."  
“你不是幸运，渚薰！你应该拥有任何人都有权拥有的东西！”我反驳道，“你也是这一切的受害者。”

"I know that!" He snaps back in frustration, "I know I was a 'victim' but I can't hide from the fact that I hurt people and I hate that. I hate living with that guilt knowing what I did and what I nearly did. I hate not knowing what I should feel guilty about and what I shouldn't feel guilty about. I hate that my only response to bad things that happen to me are to accept it. I hate that I got beat up by some thugs and I just accepted it because I think I deserved it. I hate that my only response to being told I couldn't travel was that I deserved it. I hate that I felt I had no right to get angry about the things Shinji did to you!"  
“我知道！”他懊恼地回击，“我知道我是‘受害者’，但我无法逃避我伤害了人的事实，我讨厌这样。我讨厌背负着那些罪恶感，知道我做了什么，差点做了什么。我讨厌不知道该对什么感到内疚，不该对什么感到内疚。我讨厌面对发生在自己身上的坏事时，唯一的反应就是接受。我讨厌被一些小混混打了一顿，却只是接受了，因为我觉得我活该。我讨厌当被告知不能旅行时，我觉得我活该。我讨厌我觉得自己没有权利对真嗣对你做的事感到愤怒！”

"So… that did make you angry?"  
"所以…那确实让你生气了？"

"Yes! God yes, it made me so angry!" He answers, "Somethings it feels like my heart is being torn into two pieces. I just want that pain to stop and I know I can make it stop if I'm honest but I'm scared of being honest because I think if I am everything will be taken away from me. I'm at the mercy of this world and at any moment it can all be snatched away from me. What then? I'll have nothing, I'll be nothing!"  
"是的！天啊，是的，它让我非常生气！" 他回答道，"有时候感觉我的心被撕成了两半。我只是想让那种痛苦停止，我知道如果我诚实的话，我可以让它停止，但我害怕诚实，因为我认为如果我诚实了，一切都会从我身边被夺走。我任由这个世界摆布，任何时刻它都可能从我这里夺走一切。那时怎么办？我将一无所有，我将什么都不是！"

"Kaworu." I look deep into his eyes as I draw him closer, "That will never… ever happen. I promise you as long as I am breathing I will not let that happen to you."  
"渚。" 我深深地凝视着他的眼睛，将他拉近，"那永远不会…永远不会发生。我向你保证，只要我还在呼吸，我就不会让那种事发生在你身上。"

"Thank you." His voice is just above a whisper, "I will… try to be more honest with you. I will try to believe that. I guess, I still have so much left to learn."  
"谢谢你。" 他的声音几乎细不可闻，"我会……努力对你更坦诚。我会试着相信这一点。我想，我还有很多东西需要学习。"

"We all do." I nod, "The Asuka you see now is a world away from the one you would have seen several years ago. Even I'm still figuring this stuff out."  
"我们都是如此。" 我点头，"你现在看到的明日香，与几年前你可能会见到的那个她，已是天壤之别。即便是我，也仍在摸索这些事情。"

"The thing with Shinji…" He looks at me, "I should be honest about it… He did make me angry when he told me those things. I appreciate the circumstances were extreme but I still find it hard to imagine him being capable of that."  
"关于真嗣的事……" 他看着我，"我应该坦白……他告诉我那些事时，确实让我生气了。我理解当时的情境非常极端，但我仍然难以想象他能做出那种事。"

"Do you blame yourself?" I ask him.  
"你责怪自己吗？" 我问他。

He nods, "A little bit, but I am trying not to. I know deep down he only has himself to blame and he has to live with that. Still, if you forgive him then I will also do such a thing. That is what I would like to do."  
他点点头，"有一点，但我正努力不去想。我知道他内心深处只能怪他自己，他必须承受这个。不过，如果你原谅了他，我也会这么做。这是我想要做的。"

"I did forgive him. I forgave him a long time ago." I reply to Kaworu, "Honestly… it was something I never wanted to think about. Everything was so fucked up at that time that I can't help but think if it was the other way around I'd have done the same. I'm not exactly clean as a person, you know that."  
"我确实原谅了他。我很早以前就原谅他了。" 我对渚说，"老实说……这是我不想再去想的事情。那时候一切都乱套了，我不禁想如果换作是我，我可能也会做同样的事。你知道的，我这个人并不干净。"

"I understand." Kaworu smiles at me, "I think you should speak to him about it though, it is clearly something that weighs on him."  
"我明白。" 渚薰对我微笑，"不过，我觉得你应该和他谈谈，这显然是他心头的重担。"

"Oh, I intend to, believe me." I nod, "As for you… what do you want to do?"  
"哦，我确实打算这么做，相信我。" 我点头，"至于你…你想做什么？"

"Right now?" I see a blush come to his cheeks, "Right now I… would very much like to make love to you."  
"现在吗？" 我看到他的脸颊泛起红晕，"现在我…非常想和你做爱。"

It takes me a moment to actually realize what he has just said. The smile fades from my lips as I look at him and raise an eyebrow, "Really… now?"  
我愣了一会儿才真正明白他刚才说的话。我看着他，扬起眉毛，嘴角的笑容渐渐消失，"真的…现在吗？"

He nods, "Y-Yes… I… I do not know why but suddenly I feel… like I want to… If you do not want to then that is okay… I-"  
他点头，"嗯…我…我不知道为什么，但突然间我感到…好像我想…如果你不愿意，那也没关系…我-"

I feel my hand lower from his cheek down to his shirt where I grab it tightly and pull him towards me. My free hand reaches around the back of his head, running my hands through his soft hair as our lips touch. I slide my tongue into his mouth, eliciting a soft moan from him.  
我感到我的手从他的脸颊滑落到他的衬衫上，紧紧抓住并把他拉向我。我空着的那只手绕到他的脑后，手指穿过他柔软的头发，我们的唇瓣相触。我探出舌头进入他的口中，引得他发出一声轻柔的呻吟。

After a moment my hand leaves his shirt, moving to the side of his body. I feel him as he shifts himself from the side of the bed, casts the duvet aside and moved into a position over me. We continue our kiss, our tongues dancing as our hands explore one another's bodies. His touch elicits little sparks of electricity through me as my desire for him takes over.  
片刻后，我的手从他的衬衫上移开，挪到他的身体侧面。我感觉到他侧身从床边挪开，掀开被子，移动到我上方。我们继续接吻，舌头交缠，双手在彼此的身体上探索。他的触摸在我体内激起微弱的电流感，我对他的渴望占据了上风。

Finally I break the kiss, "Is that a good enough answer for you?"  
最终我结束了这个吻，“这样回答你满意吗？”

### Chapter 21: The Damage  
第二十一章：破坏  

**October 25th - Tokyo 2 – Shinji Ikari  
10 月 25 日 - 东京 2 - 碇真嗣**

I'm not sure Tokita expected to see me here when he opened the door to Misato. In fact, I'm sure that if looks could kill I'd be little more than a pile of ash his doorstep right now. I try to remind myself to not feel bad about this. His dislike of me isn't my fault and his dislike of me isn't justified. Yet, as I follow him and Misato silently into his office, I can't help but feel guilty.  
当富田打开门看到美里时，我不确定他是否预料到我会在这里。事实上，我确信如果目光能杀人的话，我现在已经在他家门口化为一堆灰烬了。我试图提醒自己不要为此感到难过。他不喜欢我不是我的错，他不喜欢我也没有道理。然而，当我默默地跟着他和美里走进他的办公室时，我忍不住感到内疚。

We enter through a darkened and heavy set of wooden double doors into his office. It is exactly what I expected for someone like him. Dotted around the walls are various photographs of Tokita meeting important people, world leaders, CEOs, celebrities, that sort of thing. In some cases, the photograph is accompanied by a newspaper headline or clipping.  
我们穿过一扇昏暗而厚重的木制双开门进入他的办公室。这正是我预料中像他这样的人会有的办公室。墙上散布着各种富田与重要人物会面的照片，包括世界领导人、首席执行官、名人等等。在某些情况下，照片旁边还附有报纸头条或剪报。

As my eyes scan the room, one photograph in particular catches my eye. It's of Tokita and two others, a man and a woman wearing lab coats and protective headgear. They are all smiling for the camera and in the background, I can see part of the Jet Alone. I look back at Tokita, he has aged considerably since that photo was taken it seems and I feel those little pangs of guilt stab at me.  
我的目光扫过房间，一张特别的照片吸引了我的注意。那是时田和另外两人的合影，一男一女都穿着实验服，戴着防护头盔。他们对着镜头微笑，背景中隐约可见“Jet Alone”的一部分。我再次看向时田，似乎自那张照片拍摄以来，他已经老了许多，我感到一阵阵内疚刺痛着我。

I turn to the photo again, they all must have been proud of what they had made. The Jet Alone was supposed to have been a viable alternative to the Evangelion. It was supposed to have been a machine that could fight the Angels instead, it would operate remotely with no need for a pilot and didn't have the same power limitations that the Eva did.  
我又转向那张照片，他们当时一定为他们所创造的成果感到自豪。“Jet Alone”本应是 EVA 的可行替代品。它本应是一台能够与使徒战斗的机器，无需驾驶员远程操作，也不受 EVA 那样的动力限制。

The only thing that set it apart was the lack of an A.T. Field, I don't know if they ever would have figured that out. Knowing what I know now about A.T. Fields it... doesn't seem possible, it seems that the Eva's could do what they did because of what they were and that just couldn't be replicated in a machine.  
它唯一与众不同之处在于缺乏 A.T.力场，我不知道他们是否能解决这个问题。现在我了解了 A.T.力场的知识，这...似乎是不可能的，EVA 能做到它们所做的一切，是因为它们本身的特性，而这些似乎无法在机器中复制。

Still, they must have been proud of their creation and I think I would have liked the idea of something like that existing. I hated piloting so anything that would take the weight of it off of my shoulders would have been welcomed. NERV... had other ideas though I guess.  
尽管如此，他们一定为自己的创造感到自豪，我想我会喜欢那种存在的想法。我讨厌驾驶，所以任何能减轻我肩上负担的东西都会受到欢迎。NERV... 不过，我想他们有别的想法。

SEELE... NERV... my father made the Jet Alone into a joke. I don't know the exact details of it but I remember afterwards seeing a lot of news programs and newspapers running stories about the Jet Alone and the company that made it. None of them saying anything good. Tokita... was a big believer in that project, one the people in charge of it. He must have invested a lot and to see it crumble like that must have hurt.  
SEELE... NERV... 我父亲让 Jet Alone 成了一个笑话。我不清楚具体细节，但我记得在那之后，看到很多新闻节目和报纸都在报道 Jet Alone 和制造它的公司。没有一句好话。Tokita... 是那个项目的坚定支持者，也是负责人之一。他一定投入了很多，看到它就这样崩溃，一定很痛心。

I feel more pangs of guilt in my stomach, I helped contribute to that didn't I? The images of the Jet Alone being stopped had Eva Unit 01 in there. Me and Misato... we stopped that machine but we were only doing what we thought was right. We didn't know the thing had been sabotaged!  
我感到更多的内疚在胃里翻腾，我也有份参与，不是吗？Jet Alone 被阻止的画面里有 Eva Unit 01。我和美里... 我们阻止了那台机器，但我们只是在做我们认为正确的事。我们不知道那东西被破坏了！

"Miss Katsuragi, thank you for agreeing to meet with me. Mr Ikari, your presence is unexpected yet also welcome." He declares, snapping me from my thoughts and causing me to turn back to face him. He is now sat at his desk, his eyes still locked onto me. His stare is piercing, almost like he is trying to intimidate me, yet it feels mild compared to what I've seen before. "I know the two of you will probably not want to be here anymore than I want the two of you here, so we should get this out of the way as quickly as possible, agreed?"  
“葛城小姐，感谢您同意与我见面。碇先生，您的到来虽在意料之外，却也令人欣慰。” 他的话音将我从思绪中拉回，使我转过身来面对他。他此刻正坐在办公桌后，目光依旧紧锁在我身上。他的凝视锐利，仿佛试图威慑我，但与我之前所见相比，这感觉还算温和。“我知道你们两位大概也不愿留在这里，正如我不愿你们在此一样，所以我们尽快解决此事，如何？”

"At least you're honest, okay fine." Misato nods, "Let's get on with this."  
“至少你很坦诚，好吧。” 美里点头道，“我们开始吧。”

Tokita stands up and continues to glare, "Very well, first of all the committee have deemed it necessary that I should apologize to the two of you for my conduct during the debates regarding Mr Nagisa. I accept that my actions were unprofessional on that occasion, so I would like to extend an apology to both yourself and Miss Langley Soryu."  
时田站起身来，继续瞪视着，“很好，首先，委员会认为我应当为在关于渚先生的辩论中我的行为向两位道歉。我承认那次的行为不够专业，因此我想向您和绫波零小姐表达歉意。”

He looks at me after speaking but the apology itself carries very little, if any, sincerity. I should know, I'm an expert at apologizing to people, I can tell when it means nothing. Tokita isn't sorry for anything, he is doing this purely because they've asked him to.  
他说完话后看着我，但那道歉本身几乎没有任何诚意，如果有的话。我应该知道，我是个向人道歉的专家，我能分辨出什么时候道歉毫无意义。Tokita 对任何事都不感到抱歉，他这么做纯粹是因为他们要求他这样做。

I turn to look at Misato, from the look on her face I think she knows this is bullshit as well but then again, she is about to do the same. She is about to apologize for something she knows wasn't her fault. She likely won't mean that apology. This is what being an adult in this situation Is about, isn't it? Just saying the right words so that you can get what you want. There is no meaning in this. I... I hate this aspect of adults.  
我转向看着美里，从她的表情来看，我想她也知道这是胡说八道，但话说回来，她即将做同样的事情。她即将为一件她知道不是她的错的事情道歉。她可能不会真心实意地道歉。这就是在这种情境下作为一个成年人的意义，不是吗？只是说出正确的话，以便得到你想要的东西。这其中没有任何意义。我……我讨厌成年人的这一面。

Still, how many times have I said I'm sorry? How many times did I take the blame for something that wasn't my fault just because it was easy and convenient. Asuka used to berate me all the time for it. It was just my defense mechanism she used to say. I'm just as bad as these people are. Still, I don't want to be like that. I want to be sincere in what I say.  
尽管如此，我说过多少次‘对不起’了？有多少次我为不是我的错的事情承担责任，只是因为这样做既简单又方便。明日香过去常常为此责备我。她过去常说这只是我的防御机制。我和这些人一样糟糕。尽管如此，我不想变成那样。我希望我说的话是真诚的。

Before I know it, I've taken a step forward. I know Misato will have a go at me for this later, if not after I do it but I feel like I have to do this. Maybe I wasn't at fault for what had happened but my words will carry some weight at least. It isn't like the person responsible for it is here to apologize and... I'm the closest person to him so... it must mean something.  
在我意识到之前，我已经向前迈了一步。我知道美里事后会为此责备我，即使不是在我这么做之后，但我觉得我必须这么做。也许我并非那件事的过错方，但我的话至少能起到一些作用。毕竟，真正该道歉的人不在这里……而我，作为与他最亲近的人……这一定意味着什么。

"Thank you." I start to speak, "I... would also like to apologize to you. For the actions of my father and NERV many years ago during the Jet Alone tests."  
“谢谢你。”我开始说道，“我……也想向你道歉。为了多年前我父亲和 NERV 在 Jet Alone 测试中的行为。”

"Shinji!" I hear Misato snap at me almost immediately after I speak, "I thought I told you to not apologize!"  
“真嗣！”我几乎立刻听到美里厉声对我说，“我不是告诉过你不要道歉吗！”

"I know that Misato but..."  
"我知道 Misato，但是……"

"What happened had nothing to do with you and you know it!" She snaps back at me which causes me to turn and look at her.  
"发生的事与你无关，你自己也清楚！" 她厉声回敬我，这让我转头看向她。

"It had nothing to do with you either!" I fire back, "Yet, you were going to say the same thing. Why does it matter who says it?"  
"那件事也与你无关！" 我反驳道，"然而，你也打算说同样的话。谁说出来又有什么区别呢？"

"Enough." I hear Tokita suddenly speak, cutting us off before Misato can answer me. I turn around to see him looking directly at me, the glare is still there but I feel like some of the hatred has lessened somewhat, "Ikari, you were saying?"  
"够了。" 我听到富田突然开口，在我们还没等到美里回答之前就打断了对话。我转过身，看到他直视着我，那股怒气依旧，但似乎仇恨有所减轻，"碇，你刚才说什么？"

I look at the photo of Tokita and the others again before turning back to the man himself. I hadn't really gotten this far in my head, I was kinda hoping that after I had said that Misato would jump in to say the rest. I turn to her for help but she shakes her head.  
我再次看向富田和其他人的照片，然后转向他本人。我心里其实没想这么远，我本以为说完那番话后美里会接过话茬。我转向她寻求帮助，但她摇了摇头。

"I was... apologizing on behalf of my father and NERV for what happened to the Jet Alone." I answer as I lower my gaze to the ground, "I don't really know what happened but I... I know it was a big deal. I know you... lost a lot because of it."  
"我是在...代表我父亲和 NERV 为 Jet Alone 事件道歉。" 我回答着，目光低垂至地面，"我不太清楚具体发生了什么，但我知道...那是一件大事。我知道你...因此失去了很多。"

I look back up and see his gaze hasn't shifted from me, I feel a chill run down my spine as I turn and see MIsato also looking at me. I can't help but feel I've handled this badly, that I've made a mistake by actually trying to take action for once. Tokita seems unconvinced by what I've said and I've pissed Misato off as well.  
我抬头回望，发现他的目光依旧锁定在我身上，当我转身看到美里也在盯着我时，我不禁打了个寒颤。我不禁觉得自己处理得不好，这次真的采取行动是个错误。富田似乎对我的话并不信服，而且我也惹恼了美里。

Is this the second time in two days my mouth and lack of thought has gotten me into trouble? No, I'm sure this is the right thing to do. I'm sure this time I should be doing this, I have to put things right here. If he doesn't accept it or believe me then that is on him but I'm getting this out there. I'm not having me or Misato take the blame for this. I'm sure if Asuka was here she'd be backing me up on this too.  
这是两天内第二次因为我的嘴和缺乏思考而陷入麻烦吗？不，我确信这是正确的做法。这次我应该这么做，我必须在这里纠正错误。如果他不接受或不相信我，那是他的问题，但我要把话说清楚。我不会让美里或我自己为此承担责任。我确信如果明日香在这里，她也会支持我的。

"I know you hate me because of what my father did and... I'm fine with that." I continue to speak, "My father hurt a lot of people, I know I'm not to blame for it but... his actions hurt people and I should-"  
“我知道你恨我是因为我父亲所做的事，而且……我对此没意见。”我继续说道，“我父亲伤害了很多人，我知道我不该为此负责，但……他的行为伤害了人们，我应该——”

"You are incorrect." Much to my surprise it is Tokita who interrupts me, "Katsuragi, is what he is saying correct?"  
"你说错了。" 令我惊讶的是，打断我的是土岐，"桂木，他说的对吗？"

I look at Misato and she nods, "Yes, it is. NERV sabotaged your project to not only ensure it wouldn't work but also that any future development would no longer go ahead. Part of the reason I agreed to meet you was to deliver an official apology on behalf of..."  
我看向美里，她点头道："是的，没错。NERV 破坏了你的项目，不仅是为了确保它无法成功，还为了阻止任何未来的发展。我同意与你见面的一部分原因，就是为了代表……"

"On behalf of people who are no longer here to face the repercussions of their actions, unless you are about to tell that you had something to do with it?"  
"代表那些已经不在的人，无法面对自己行为的后果，除非你接下来要告诉我，你也参与其中？"

"Misato had nothing to do with it." I answer back before Misato has a chance to, "We were desperate to stop that thing. Misato jumped into the core of that thing, she made herself ill for the best part of the night trying to stop that thing. She was told she was lucky to have survived, she wouldn't have done that if she knew everything was going to be fine!"  
“这跟美里无关。” 我抢在美里开口前回答，“我们当时迫切需要阻止那东西。美里跳进了那东西的核心，她整晚大部分时间都在努力阻止它，把自己搞得病倒了。她被告知能活下来已是万幸，如果她知道一切都会好起来，她是不会那么做的！”

Tokita looks between the two of us and then locks his eyes on me again, "It seems I might have been wrong about you Ikari, perhaps you are not the man I thought you were. Although if I can, I would advise against any sort of political career, whilst your outburst here was within a safe place, such things would be dangerous in public. If the wrong person were to hear you, what do you think would have happened?"  
时田在我们两人之间来回看了看，然后再次将目光锁定在我身上，“看来我可能错怪你了，碇，也许你并非我所认为的那种人。不过，如果可以的话，我建议你不要涉足政治生涯，尽管你在这里的爆发是安全的，但在公众场合，这样的行为会很危险。如果被不该听到的人听到了，你认为会发生什么？”

I look at Misato and she nods, "That's why I told you to let me handle it."  
我看向美里，她点头道，“这就是为什么我告诉你要让我来处理。”

"O-Oh..." I stop to think about it for a moment, was what I had just done really all that stupid? If I had left it to Misato he would have learned the same thing, wouldn't he? But... no, I did the right thing. Still I think about all the meetings Misato has been in, how she has told me the various NDAs she has had to sign. Was this another case like that, was I even supposed to be here?  
"哦-哦..." 我停下来思考了一会儿，刚才我所做的真的有那么愚蠢吗？如果我交给美里处理，他也会学到同样的东西，不是吗？但是...不，我做对了。尽管如此，我想起了美里参加过的那些会议，她告诉我她不得不签署的各种保密协议。这是否又是那样的情况，我甚至应该在这里吗？

"Still, what is done is done I suppose." Tokita continues, "I appreciate the truth finally coming out. I always suspected something had happened but there was little I could do about it. Immediately after the failed test the project was halted, funding stripped and the company had to declare bankruptcy. It was a national embarrassment."  
"不过，我想事情已经发生了，也只能这样了。" 时田继续说道，"我很感激真相终于大白。我一直怀疑发生了什么，但我对此无能为力。测试失败后，项目立即被叫停，资金被撤回，公司不得不宣布破产。这是一场全国性的耻辱。"

I can hear the venom in his voice as he speaks, I don't blame him. He clearly believed in what he was doing, even if he did come across as arrogant towards Misato at that time. In the end, he was just a victim.  
我能听出他说话时的怨恨，我不怪他。他显然相信自己在做的事情，即使当时他对美里显得傲慢。最终，他只是一个受害者。

"There was no guarantee it would have worked anyway." Misato replies, "Not in a fight against the Angels."  
“无论如何，这并不能保证有效。”美里回答，“对抗使徒的战斗中并非如此。”

"Perhaps, but it was never given that opportunity and we will never know." He replies, "Still, perhaps it would be best to move on from this. I appreciate the apology, and would once again like to apologize for my actions. Still, I would like to ask the two of you, do you honestly believe Nagisa is not a threat?"  
“或许吧，但从未有机会验证，我们也无从知晓。”他回应道，“尽管如此，也许最好还是放下这件事。我感谢你的道歉，并再次为我的行为道歉。不过，我想问你们两位，你们真的认为渚不是威胁吗？”

Misato looks at me for a moment and then back to him, she shakes her head, "I have my doubts. Maybe on another day I might have even agreed with you to restrict him altogether. I saw first-hand what he was capable of, I was there to watch him talk with SEELE and I... saw what he did to Shinji."  
美里看了我一会儿，然后又转向他，摇了摇头，“我有些疑虑。也许在另一天，我甚至可能会同意你们完全限制他。我亲眼见过他的能力，我就在那里看着他与 SEELE 交谈，我……看到了他对真嗣所做的一切。”

"So enlighten me, why change your mind?"  
"那么请指教，为何改变主意？"

Misato shrugs, "Maybe I haven't. Maybe in the back of my head I do still see him as a threat. Maybe a part of me does think that members of SEELE somehow survived and they're either in communication with him or waiting to get in contact with him. Maybe I do think he'll regain his abilities as an Angel and finish what he tried to start five years ago. It's all possible..."  
美里耸耸肩，"也许我并没有。或许在我潜意识里，我仍视他为威胁。也许我的一部分确实认为 SEELE 的某些成员可能幸存，他们要么正在与他联系，要么正等待与他接触。也许我真的认为他会恢复作为使徒的能力，完成五年前他试图开始的事情。这一切都有可能..."

"You aren't making a very convincing case Katsuragi."  
"你这番话可不太有说服力，葛城。"

"But it's also possible that what we have seen is the truth. That he was another victim of SEELEs manipulation. That he is completely human and that he just wants to have a chance to live his life." Misato answers him, "I... do have doubts, of course I do but I also know my doubts are built off of my past feelings towards the Angels and him in particular. It's a gamble, I know but... I'm willing to take that chance."  
"但也有可能我们所见的就是真相。他只是 SEELE 操纵下的又一个受害者。他完全是人类，只是想要一个活下去的机会。" 美里回答他，"我……当然有疑虑，我当然有，但我也知道我的疑虑是建立在我对使徒和他个人的过往感受上的。这是个赌注，我知道，但是……我愿意冒这个险。"

"And you Ikari, you are willing to let things go?"  
"那么你，碇，你愿意放下一切吗？"

I nod, "Yes, I don't want to live in the past anymore. I'm not my father."  
我点头，"是的，我不想再活在过去了。我不是我父亲。"

**October 28th - Berlin – Kaworu Nagisa  
10 月 28 日 - 柏林 - 渚薰**

I lean back in my chair and look around the currently empty office and enjoy this brief moment and peace and calm within myself. I do not know how long these feelings will last for, so I hope to enjoy them whilst they do last. I suppose as long as I try to uphold my promise of being more open and honest with my own feelings then it will go some way to alleviating some of the anxieties within myself.  
我靠在椅背上，环顾此刻空无一人的办公室，享受着这短暂的宁静与内心的平和。我不知道这些感觉会持续多久，所以希望在它们持续的时候尽情享受。我想，只要我努力遵守对自己更开放、更诚实的承诺，就能在一定程度上缓解内心的焦虑。

Admitting those things to Asuka... it was not easy. It seems so silly to think that now as I reflect on it but there was such a struggle to tell her about my fears. I am glad that I have though, I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders, I feel some sense of clarity.  
向明日香承认那些事情……并不容易。现在回想起来，这似乎很可笑，但当时告诉她我的恐惧却是一场挣扎。不过我很高兴我做到了，感觉肩上的重担被卸下了，我感到一丝清晰。

My next obstacle is to speak to Shinji about his confessions to me. I sent him a quick e-mail to let him know that things are okay between us and that I do still wish to see him. I haven't spoken to him about the various things Asuka told me. I do not think it is my place to get involved with that, that is for Asuka and Shinji to discuss.  
我的下一个难题是与真嗣谈论他对我的告白。我给他发了一封简短的电子邮件，告诉他我们之间一切都好，我仍然希望见到他。我还没有和他谈过明日香告诉我的那些事情。我认为这不是我该介入的，那是明日香和真嗣需要讨论的。

I have also been asking myself a number of questions though regarding Shinji. I have been questioning whether or not I do wish to return to Tokyo-3 to see him again. I have been questioning if what I imagined Shinji to be is truly the person he is. I realize it was probably silly to expect him to be that pure vision that I had within my head but I did not expect things to have been as bad as I have been told.  
我也一直在问自己关于真嗣的许多问题。我一直在质疑我是否真的想回到东京-3 再次见他。我一直在质疑我心目中的真嗣是否真的是他本人。我意识到，期望他是我脑海中那个纯洁的形象可能是愚蠢的，但我没想到事情会像我被告知的那样糟糕。

I am sure people outside of the three of us would perhaps question why any of us would want to see the other. We have all in some way hurt each other, in devastating ways but I think perhaps why is why we want to, why we need to meet with one another again. This race of beings that I belong to, we all have the capacity to learn, change and grow from the people we were into better people. It is up to us whether or not we take it.  
我确信我们三个人之外的人可能会质疑我们为什么还想见对方。我们都以某种方式伤害了彼此，以毁灭性的方式，但我认为我们想要见面的原因，是我们需要再次见面。我所属的这个种族，我们都有能力从过去的自己学习、改变和成长为更好的人。是否接受这一点取决于我们自己。

Shinji, I think took his chance, he regrets his actions, he is apologetic for them and expressed as much. No, his actions can't be justified and ignored but he has spent years going over them again and again. He faced Instrumentality, had himself stripped to his very core and witnessed his life and all the events that transpired. He was made to witness worlds with and without him. He has been within his own mind for all that time, to be lost within your own mind, to relive your mistakes... that is painful, that is a punishment in of itself.  
真嗣，我想他抓住了机会，他为自己的行为感到后悔，对此表示歉意并表达了这一点。不，他的行为无法被合理化或忽视，但他多年来一直在反复思考这些行为。他面对了人类补完计划，被剥离到最核心的部分，见证了自己的一生和所有发生的事件。他被迫见证了有他和没有他的世界。他在自己的内心深处度过了所有这些时间，迷失在自己的内心，重温自己的错误...那是痛苦的，那本身就是一种惩罚。

I lean forward again just in time for Fuyutsuki to enter the office. He nods politely at me, "Good morning Nagisa, I trust you are well today?"  
我再次向前倾身，正好看到冬月进入办公室。他礼貌地向我点头，“早上好，Nagisa，我相信你今天过得好吗？”

I nod back, "I am fine, how are you?"  
我点头回应，“我很好，你呢？”

"Doing well." he checks his watch, "Whilst I remember, we have a meeting this afternoon with some representatives from the Japanese government regarding the future of the emergence facility."  
"做得不错。" 他看了看手表，"趁我记得，我们今天下午有个会议，是与日本政府的一些代表讨论紧急设施的未来。"

I nod again, "No problem, do we know what the decision is yet?"  
我再次点头，"没问题，我们还不知道决定是什么吗？"

"Not yet unfortunately. I would like to remain optimistic that the facility can be kept open for a little while longer, it is true that the numbers have dropped again but as long as people are still returning having such a facility is in our best interests."  
"不幸的是，还没有。我希望能保持乐观，认为设施可以再开放一段时间，确实人数又下降了，但只要还有人回来，拥有这样一个设施对我们最有利。"

"Of course." I smile and nod as my mind wanders to my own memories of being within that facility. It hasn't even been a year since I was found on that beach and taken there. I had no memory of who I was but within an evening that all came flooding back to me. In the months that followed I did often wonder if it would have been better for me to have not regained my memory at all but then I would not have met Asuka, I would not be in the position I am now.  
"当然。" 我微笑着点头，思绪飘回了自己在那家机构的记忆。从我在那片海滩被发现并被带到那里，至今还不到一年。我失去了记忆，但仅仅一个晚上，所有记忆如潮水般涌回。随后的几个月里，我常常想，如果我没有恢复记忆，会不会更好？但那样的话，我就不会遇到明日香，也不会有现在的位置了。

I wonder how Kodama is doing now. I don't know if I ever really told her how much she helped me back then. She didn't judge me for my past actions, she just tried to help me move forward. I hope she knows how much I appreciate that.  
我想知道儿玉现在怎么样了。我不知道是否真的告诉过她，她当时对我的帮助有多大。她没有因为我的过去行为而评判我，只是尽力帮助我向前看。我希望她知道我有多感激她。

"if it were to close, what would happen to the people working within it?" I ask.  
"如果它关闭了，里面工作的人会怎么样？" 我问道。

"Well, they would likely be posted to another medical facility either within Tokyo-2 or somewhere of their choosing. They would certainly not go without a job." he begins to explain, "As for people who return, the government would see to it that they would still be treated but my concern is that this could hinder people's recovery. They would likely be moved to a general-purpose care facility and would not receive the same specialist treatment."  
"嗯，他们很可能会被分配到东京-2 内或其他他们选择的医疗机构。他们肯定不会失业。" 他开始解释，"至于返回的人，政府会确保他们仍能得到治疗，但我担心这可能会阻碍人们的康复。他们可能会被转移到通用护理机构，而不会接受同样的专科治疗。"

"So, it would be bad for them?"  
"那么，这对他们来说会很糟糕吗？"

"Perhaps, I think people when they return need as little disruption as possible, so having the facilty where it is and serving that purpose and that purpose alone helps." he tells me, "I do understand the concerns raised, with fewer people the need for a dedicated facility decreases and treatment elsewhere would be cheaper."  
"或许吧，我认为人们返回时需要尽可能少的干扰，因此设施所在的位置及其单一目的有助于此。" 他告诉我，"我确实理解提出的担忧，随着人数减少，对专门设施的需求降低，其他地方的治疗成本会更低。"

"I would like it to remain open." I add, "It... They helped me a lot when I returned."  
"我希望它保持开放。" 我补充道，"它……在我回来时给予了我很多帮助。"

"indeed, and it is your return that helped spark this wave of discussions. Before you came back they were almost certainly going to close it, it seemed your return was a catalyst for many more to come back."  
"确实如此，正是你的回归引发了这一系列讨论。在你回来之前，他们几乎肯定要关闭它，看来你的回归成了许多人回来的催化剂。"

"I... do not understand how that happened but... I am glad to have done something good."  
"我……不太明白这是怎么发生的，但是……我很高兴能做了件好事。"

"Indeed, whilst I remember how is Ms Soryu doing? Have there been any further problems?"  
"确实，我记得草薙小姐怎么样了？还有其他问题吗？"

I shake my head, "No, nothing, she has been fine. Thank you for coming around the other night. I... wasn't really sure what I should do, Asuka... hates hospitals so taking her there seemed like a last resort."  
我摇摇头，“没有，一切正常，她很好。谢谢你那天晚上过来。我……当时真不知道该怎么办，明日香……讨厌医院，所以带她去那里似乎是最后的办法。”

"Well, given what I know about Asuka I can understand your hesitation but it probably would have been the best thing to do." He explains, "She was lucky she wasn't hurt more by her fall but... it is best to not dwell on such things."  
“嗯，考虑到我对明日香的了解，我能理解你的犹豫，但可能去医院才是最好的选择。”他解释道，“她摔倒时还算幸运，没有受更重的伤，但……最好不要纠结于这些事情。”

"I know... it just seems like the stress of the debate with the U.N, her book, and a number of other things got to her. I think that when we argued it... well it was a bit too much." I explain, not wishing to betray the various things Asuka told me to Fuyutsuki. Her distrust of him has been made quite clear to me and whilst I do not share her sentiments I will respect them.  
"我知道...只是联合国辩论、她的书以及其他许多事情的压力似乎压垮了她。我想当我们争吵时...嗯，那有点太过火了。" 我解释道，不想向冬月透露明日香告诉我的那些事情。她对他的不信任已经向我表露无遗，尽管我并不认同她的看法，但我还是会尊重她的意愿。

"Arguments are unfortunately a part of any relationship. There will always be certain things or events that will cause people to disagree, it can be something silly or something serious. I trust you two are alright now though?"  
"不幸的是，争吵是任何关系的一部分。总会有某些事情或事件导致人们意见不合，可能是些琐碎的小事，也可能是严重的大事。不过我相信你们现在没事了吧？"

I nod again, "Yes, we are quite fine. We have... discussed what has happened in great detail."  
我再次点头，"是的，我们很好。我们已经...详细讨论了发生的事情。"

"Very good." He smiles, "And I trust you are both eager to visit Japan in December?"  
"非常好。" 他微笑着说，"我相信你们俩都迫不及待想在十二月去日本吧？"

"We are..." I hesitate for a moment as my mind returns to my previous thoughts of Shinji. I admit, my excitement has been dampened somewhat by what I have heard. I am also quite nervous about the reality of the situation, this is going to happen. I am going to see Shinji and a number of his friends and the people he calls his family. They will know about me, who I am and whilst Shinji may have forgiven me I wonder about their feelings, "I must admit, I am nervous about encountering Shinji's friends and that I may not be received quite so warmly by them."  
"我们确实很期待..." 我犹豫了一下，思绪回到了之前对真嗣的思考。我承认，我所听到的消息让我的兴奋感有所减弱。我也对现实情况感到相当紧张，这一切即将发生。我将见到真嗣和他的许多朋友，以及他称之为家人的人们。他们会知道我是谁，而尽管真嗣可能已经原谅了我，我仍想知道他们的感受，"我必须承认，我对遇见真嗣的朋友们感到紧张，担心他们可能不会那么热情地接纳我。"

"Understandable." He nods, "Stepping back into a world like that can be frightening. I am sure you have nothing to be worried about though. I believe Shinji's friends are similar to him in their capacity to forgive."  
"可以理解。" 他点头道，"重新踏入那样的世界确实令人害怕。但我确信你无需担心。我相信真嗣的朋友们和他一样，都有宽恕他人的能力。"

"Thank you." I lower my eyes as he answers my concern. Still, there is one other thing concerning me. I still have questions regarding Shinji and the person he is.  
"谢谢你。" 我垂下眼帘，他回应了我的关切。然而，还有一件事让我挂心。关于真嗣和他的人格，我仍有许多疑问。

"Is there something else concerning you?"  
"还有什么让你担忧的吗？"

"Perhaps" I admit to him, I don't think it'd be a good idea to tell Fuyutsuki the intimate details of what I have been told and heard from Shinji. I do not think he needs to hear that sort of thing but I know he can perhaps still offer some advice, "I... cannot tell you exactly what it is but recently Shinji told me certain things that have concerned me. I am unsure how to proceed with this information. I guess it kinda taught me that there is a lot about Shinji I don't really know."  
"或许吧。" 我向他坦承，我觉得告诉冬月那些我从真嗣那里听到的私密细节并不妥当。我认为他不需要听到那些，但我知道他或许仍能提供一些建议，"我……无法确切告诉你是什么，但最近真嗣告诉了我一些让我担忧的事情。我不确定该如何处理这些信息。我想这让我意识到，我对真嗣的了解其实很有限。"

"I see... Well I am afraid I do not know how much I can help you in that regard. Regretfully I do not know Shinji quite as much as I should do. I have been somewhat neglectful to him in my role as his godfather over the years."  
"我明白了...恐怕在这方面我能帮到你的有限。遗憾的是，我对真嗣的了解并不如我应该的那样多。作为他的教父，这些年我对他有些疏忽。"

"You're his godfather?" I look at Fuyutsuki surprised, although I'm not sure if I should be. After all I know how close he was to Shinji's parents.  
"您是他的教父？" 我惊讶地看着冬月，虽然不确定自己是否应该感到惊讶。毕竟我知道他和真嗣的父母关系有多密切。

"Yes." Fuyutsuki confirms, "Both his father and Yui came to me upon finding out they were to have a child. Unfortunately, as I have said, I have not been very active in that role. I maintained distance when he was growing up on his father's orders and whilst I have endeavored to help him since Third Impact I have still maintained some distance. I do not think he even knows I am his godfather."  
"是的。" 冬月确认道，"他的父亲和唯在得知他们即将有孩子时来找我。不幸的是，如我所说，我在这个角色上并不活跃。在他成长过程中，我按照他父亲的命令保持距离，尽管在第三次冲击后我努力帮助他，但仍保持了一定的距离。我想他甚至不知道我是他的教父。"

I can hear the regret in Fuyutsuki's voice as he speaks. I truly had no idea about any of this, if I had have done I would perhaps not have asked. Still, I have already started to delve into this rabbit hole, I cannot turn around now, "You... know him more than I do though. What is he... like?"  
我听得出冬月声音中的懊悔，他开口说道。我确实对这一切一无所知，如果早知道，也许我就不会问了。尽管如此，我已经踏入了这个兔子洞，现在无法回头，“你……对他比我了解得多。他……是什么样的人？”

"In many ways he is very much like his father, although I appreciate that is not a good comparison to make. Shinji in my experience can be quick to act, stubborn and extremely fearful of being hurt." Fuyutsuki answers my question and I simply nod. I know for a fact Shinji would not like to hear that, he confided a lot in me regarding his father and his feelings towards the man back when I first met him, I doubt much will have changed.  
“在很多方面，他非常像他的父亲，尽管我知道这不是一个好的比较。根据我的经验，真嗣行动迅速，固执，而且极其害怕受到伤害。”冬月回答了我的问题，我只是点点头。我敢肯定真嗣不会喜欢听到这些，他曾向我倾诉过很多关于他父亲的事以及他对那个男人的感受，那是在我第一次见到他的时候，我怀疑这些并没有多大改变。

"You were... friends with his father, weren't you?" As I ask Fuyutsuki the question I see him lower his eyes and I wonder if maybe that question has crossed a line.  
“你……和他父亲是朋友，对吧？”当我向冬月提出这个问题时，我看到他垂下了眼睛，我不禁怀疑这个问题是否越界了。

"I was the closest thing Gendo Ikari ever had to a friend, but I would not say I was his friend. I do not think Gendo Ikari ever had friends." Fuyutsuki starts to explain, "The truth is that I severely disliked the man, from the very moment I met him through to the last time I ever saw him. I did have some respect for him, I could see the potential within him but I could see all that held him back too, so no, I was not his friend."  
"我是碇源堂最接近朋友的存在，但我不会说我是他的朋友。我不认为碇源堂有过朋友。" 冬月开始解释，"事实上，我从第一次见到他到最后一面，都极其不喜欢这个人。我确实对他有些敬意，我能看到他身上的潜力，但也能看到所有阻碍他的因素，所以，不，我不是他的朋友。"

"I see..." I reply with some confusion in my voice. Fuyutsuki's words have surprised me a little bit, the impression I always got from SEELE was that the two of them were close friends, perhaps another lie?  
"我明白了..." 我带着些许困惑回答。冬月的话让我有点惊讶，我从 SEELE 得到的印象一直是他们两人是亲密的朋友，也许这又是一个谎言？

"That is not to say we were not close." Fuyutsuki speaks again, "I did help him with many of his plans after he lost Yui. He confided in me all of his plans for the future. What I did... was not out of loyalty to him though, what I did was out of grief, the grief I felt when we lost Yui. It was my desire to see her again, my belief that maybe he was right and we could see her again. It was my inability to take action and let myself be a pawn in his machinations rather than fulfilling my promises to her."  
"这并不是说我们不亲近。" 冬月再次开口，"在他失去唯之后，我确实帮助他实施了许多计划。他向我倾诉了他对未来的所有计划。但我这么做...并非出于对他的忠诚，我这么做是出于悲伤，是我们失去唯时的悲伤。我渴望再次见到她，我相信他可能是对的，我们或许能再次见到她。是我无法采取行动，让自己成为他阴谋中的棋子，而不是履行我对她的承诺。"

"I am... sorry, I did not mean to pry into your past." I quickly reply, wishing that I had no opened this can of worms. It had been my intention to ask for advice regarding Shinji and to find out more about him, not to re-open old wounds of Fuyutsuki's.  
"我很抱歉，无意探听你的过去。" 我迅速回答，希望自己没有打开这个潘多拉魔盒。我本意是想询问关于真嗣的建议，了解更多关于他的信息，而不是重新揭开冬月过去的伤疤。

"Do not apologize, I realize that there is much of this world and the one before that you do not know. Remain curious and ask questions, it is the only way you will find anything out for yourself. With that said, I feel that the conversations about my past is for another time, it was Shinji you wished to know about?"  
"无需道歉，我明白你对这个世界以及之前的世界知之甚少。保持好奇心，多问问题，这是你了解真相的唯一途径。话虽如此，我觉得关于我过去的谈话留待下次吧，你不是想了解真嗣吗？"

"Y-Yeah... I just... well I wondered what he was like. All I know is the things I have been told about him and the small glimpse I got of his life. I realized that I have this idealized view of him and learning that the reality might not be that has... shaken me somewhat. Is he really like his father?"  
"嗯...是的...我只是...想知道他是什么样的人。我所知道的只是别人告诉我的和他生活中的一瞥。我意识到我对他的看法可能过于理想化，了解到现实可能并非如此，这让我有些动摇。他真的像他父亲那样吗？"

"Well, as I said, in some ways he is. We all inherit aspects of our parents whether we like it or not. Shinji is not an exception to this but we decide our own path to follow. So, whilst he has aspects of his father, he channels them in a different way. Unlike his father, Shinji has utilized the stubbornness and quickness to act to help others."  
"嗯，正如我所说，在某些方面他是的。无论我们是否愿意，我们都会继承父母的一些特质。真嗣也不例外，但我们决定自己要走的路。因此，尽管他有他父亲的某些特点，他却以不同的方式运用它们。与他的父亲不同，真嗣利用这种固执和迅速行动的能力来帮助他人。"

I think back to some of the things I've heard about Shinji, and even how he helped me, "I have heard he can be quite selfless at times."  
我想起了一些关于真嗣的传闻，甚至包括他如何帮助我，"我听说他有时非常无私。"

"Indeed, sometimes at great personal risk to himself or against orders." Fuyutsuki answers, "I have witnessed him dive into a live volcano to save a friend. I saw him refuse to fight an infected Eva lest he hurt the human pilot inside despite the fact that his life was at risk. I... was there when the very fate of the world was put into his hands."  
"确实如此，有时甚至不惜冒着巨大的个人风险或违抗命令。" 冬月回答道，"我亲眼见他跳进活火山去救朋友。我看到他拒绝与被感染的 EVA 战斗，以免伤害到里面的人类驾驶员，尽管他自己也身处险境。我... 当时就在那里，目睹了世界的命运落在他肩上。"

"I see..." I trail off, not quite sure how to respond to what Fuyutsuki has told me or how to continue this conversation, "So... he is a good person?"  
"我明白了..." 我欲言又止，不太确定如何回应冬月告诉我的话，或是如何继续这场对话，"那么... 他是个好人吗？"

"Nagisa..." Fuyutsuki begins to answer, "I do not know exactly what Shinji has told you, nor am I going to speculate or pry but the truth is that, to borrow a cliché, life is not quite as black and white as people try to make it out to be, it is varying shades of grey. Good people are capable of doing bad things and bad people are capable of doing good things, it can be frightening to acknowledge that because we all build up our own images of what a person is like but rarely is that correct."  
"渚..." 冬月开始回答，"我不清楚真嗣跟你说了什么，也不会去猜测或窥探，但事实是，借用一句陈词滥调，生活并不像人们试图描绘的那样非黑即白，而是各种灰色的深浅。好人可能做坏事，坏人也可能做好事，承认这一点很可怕，因为我们都会构建自己心目中的人的形象，但很少是正确的。"

He pauses for a moment as I think about the truth of his words. Bad people can do good things, I suppose that is true. I know from my own experience that people aren't always the typical villain that we might make them out to be, the members of SEELE proved that. They were fundamentally bad people but they weren't constantly being evil, thinking about it, they had lives outside of their plans. They were capable of good things.  
他停顿了一下，我思考着他话中的真实性。坏人可能做好事，我想这是真的。从我自己的经历中我知道，人们并不总是我们可能认为的那种典型反派，SEELE 的成员证明了这一点。他们本质上是坏人，但并不总是做坏事，想想看，他们在计划之外也有生活。他们有能力做好事。

This could be true. Shinji did a bad thing, unjustifiable but that doesn't mean I should shut him out or turn my back on him.  
这可能是真的。真嗣做了件错事，虽无法辩解，但这并不意味着我应该将他拒之门外或背弃他。

"I see... I think I understand now."  
"我明白了...我想我现在理解了。"

"My advice, talk to Shinji. Engage with him and clear the air between the two of you. Decide for yourself whether or not he deserves your forgiveness but I think in this case whatever he has done can be overcome. "  
"我的建议是，和真嗣谈谈。与他沟通，消除你们之间的误会。你自己决定他是否值得原谅，但我认为，无论他做了什么，都是可以克服的。"

I nod, knowing that Fuyutsuki is right. I should speak to Shinji. I shoud tell him how what he has told me makes me feel, I should admit my uncertainty but I should leave that door open. I should express to him I don't want our friendship to end. I should tell him that he should begin to forgive himself for his actions just as I am trying to forgive myself for my actions.  
我点头，知道冬月是对的。我应该和真嗣谈谈。我应该告诉他他所说的话让我有什么感受，我应该承认我的不确定，但应该让那扇门敞开着。我应该向他表达，我不希望我们的友谊结束。我应该告诉他，他应该开始原谅自己的行为，就像我正在努力原谅自己的行为一样。

**October 28th - Berlin – Asuka Langley Soryu  
10 月 28 日 - 柏林 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I am once again sat at the kitchen table and lost in thought as I stare at my phone. I'm doing the sort of thinking that can sometimes be bad for me. The sort that allows me to get lost inside my own head, makes me relive moments or play out moments yet to happen repeatedly until I don't know what to do.  
我又一次坐在厨房的桌子旁，盯着手机陷入沉思。我正在进行那种有时对我有害的思考。那种让我迷失在自己的脑海中，让我反复重现过去或预演未来的时刻，直到我不知道该怎么办的思考。

It's so easy to get lost inside that spiral and I hate it because I let it happen to me so much and all the time it always ends with me hating myself just that little bit more. This time I'm trying to make sure I don't get pulled into that spiral, it's hard because I have to relive some moments of my past and work out how things ended up the way they did.  
陷入那个漩涡是如此容易，我讨厌这一点，因为我让它一次次发生在我身上，而每次结束时，我总是更加憎恨自己。这次我试图确保自己不被卷入那个漩涡，这很难，因为我必须重温过去的某些时刻，弄清楚事情是如何发展到这一步的。

My path so far has been to start with what Shinji told Kaworu the other day. He admitted certain things to Kaworu and I'm annoyed that he spoke to Kaworu about it first rather than me. I was the victim, I should have been asked first but what is done is done. Shinji is an idiot and I'll let him know that.  
到目前为止，我的方法是先从真嗣前几天告诉渚薰的事情开始。他向渚薰承认了一些事情，我对此感到恼火，因为他先和渚薰谈了而不是我。我是受害者，我本应被首先询问，但事已至此。真嗣是个笨蛋，我会让他知道的。

So now, Kaworu knows that side of Shinji. He knows about the things Shinji did to me in that hospital and he knows about the argument we had after Third Impact started. Well, I told him about my side of it, I guess I still have some things I need to confirm about that. I've came up with questions and things I want to say to Shinji when I contact him today.  
所以现在，渚薰知道了真嗣的那一面。他知道真嗣在医院对我所做的事情，也知道我们在第三次冲击开始后发生的争吵。嗯，我告诉了他我的那一面，我想我还有一些事情需要确认。我已经想好了一些问题和今天联系真嗣时想说的话。

At the same time, I've had to ask myself a few questions, one I didn't think I had to ask. Yet, due to Shinji bringing this stuff up it has become necessary for me to answer them. I guess the first question I had for myself was, do I actually want to see Shinji again? When I take into account all of those things, the hospital room, being left to die and instrumentality itself, do I really want to see him again?  
与此同时，我不得不问自己几个问题，其中一个我本以为不必问。然而，由于真嗣提起了这些事，我必须回答它们。我想，我首先要问自己的是，我真的还想再见真嗣吗？当我考虑到所有这些事情，医院病房、被遗弃等死以及神化本身，我真的还想再见他吗？

Yes, I do. 是的，我想。

Secondly, do I actually forgive him for all that has happened? Do I forgive him for each and every one of those incidents? I think I do. Previously I just wanted to forget about them. I wanted to store those memories in a dark corner of my mind and pretend they never happened. I never wanted to face them but I know you can't run away from things forever, no matter how much you try to hide it, eventually it will catch up to you.  
其次，我是否真的原谅了他所发生的一切？我是否原谅了他每一个事件？我想我是原谅了。之前我只是想忘记它们。我想把这些记忆藏在心底的某个黑暗角落，假装它们从未发生过。我从未想过要面对它们，但我知道你不能永远逃避事情，无论你多么努力地隐藏，最终它们还是会找上你。

The worst thing is, a part of me still wants to blame myself for those three things. It wants me to say that I was in some way to blame and made him do it. I know its bullshit, I know I wasn't to blame. He is responsible for his own actions, no one else. I need to understand that and when I speak to him, I need to make sure he knows this.  
最糟糕的是，我内心的一部分仍然想要为那三件事责怪自己。它想让我承认，我在某种程度上负有责任，促使他那样做。我知道这是胡说八道，我知道我不该受责备。他应对自己的行为负责，与其他人无关。我需要明白这一点，当我与他交谈时，我必须确保他明白这一点。

Thirdly, and I suppose not related to those incidents but in the lead up, do I forgive myself for how I acted. I hate who I was back then. I hate the image of that arrogant Asuka who looked down on people at any opportunity. The Asuka who yelled at people and made demands of them because she felt so superior to them all. I was not a nice person, I crossed lines and upset people and part of this is me forgiving myself.  
第三，我想这可能与那些事件无关，但在事件发生之前，我是否原谅了自己当时的所作所为。我讨厌那时的自己。我讨厌那个傲慢的明日香，总是抓住机会看不起别人。那个对人大喊大叫、提出要求，因为觉得自己高人一等的明日香。我不是一个好人，我越界了，让人不快，这部分是我原谅自己的过程。

Not yet, I still need to work on that.  
还没有，我还需要在这方面努力。

I let out the sigh I've been holding and switch to his contact details on the phone. If I keep putting this off I get lost further and it never happens. The phone only rings a couple of times before he answers and I hear his voice, _"Asuka?"_  
我终于叹出了憋在胸口的那口气，切换到他的联系信息。如果我再拖延，只会越陷越深，事情永远无法解决。电话只响了几声他就接了，我听到了他的声音，“明日香？”

"Hello Shinji, are you free to talk?"  
“嗨，真嗣，你现在方便说话吗？”

I try to sound as neutral as I can, I don't want to sound too friendly in this situation because we do have important things to talk about but I don't want to sound too serious either because I don't want to scare him off.  
我尽量让自己的语气保持中立，既不想在这情况下显得过于友好，因为我们确实有重要的事情要谈，也不想太过严肃，以免把他吓跑。

A part of me wonders if we should be doing this by phone at all. I think I'd much rather do it in person but then if I continue to put it off I know how it'll weigh down on both of us. If we get this partly resolved now then it helps us both. I also... guess I don't want Shinji to have too much additional stress when it comes to his concert.  
我的一部分在想，我们是否根本就不该通过电话来谈这件事。我觉得我更愿意当面谈，但如果我继续拖延，我知道这会让我们俩都感到沉重。如果我们现在能部分解决这个问题，对我们双方都有帮助。而且...我想我也不希望在神志的演唱会临近时给他增加太多额外的压力。

_"Yeah... Is everything okay?"_ Shinji answers me. I can hear the nervousness in his voice as he speaks to me. I hope he can't hear it in mine.  
“嗯...一切都还好吗？”神志回答我。我能听出他说话时的紧张。希望他听不出我声音里的紧张。

"They're fine." I answer him, "I just figured that we should talk about... well those things you brought up the other day."  
“他们都没事。”我回答他，“我只是觉得我们应该谈谈...呃，你前几天提到的那些事。”

The line goes completely silent and I do wonder if maybe he has hung up on me. I take a moment to glance at the screen, the timer is still going so he is still there. It takes a few more moments before he actually responds, _"Yes... We probably should. I... I'm sorry about bringing that stuff up. I don't know what I was thinking."_  
电话那头完全沉默了，我不禁怀疑他是不是已经挂断了。我瞥了一眼屏幕，计时器还在走，说明他还在。又过了几秒钟，他终于回应道，“是的……我们或许应该谈谈。我……对于提起那些事，我很抱歉。我不知道我当时在想什么。”

"You weren't thinking... and that's part of the problem. You've always been a bit like that. Not stopping to consider what you're doing. Either that or... you were thinking too much, which is another problem." I reply to him, again remaining calm, "But... it's out there now, isn't it? So, I suppose we have to address it. I guess, we should have addressed it a long time ago, so we do it properly this time."  
“你当时没在思考……这就是问题的一部分。你总是这样，做事前不考虑后果。要么就是……你想得太多了，这是另一个问题。”我平静地回答他，“但……事情已经发生了，不是吗？所以，我想我们必须面对它。或许，我们早就该好好处理这件事了，这次我们要做得正确。”

"Yeah..." he pauses, "Asuka about... what I did to you in that hospital room... there is... no excuse for it."  
“嗯……”他停顿了一下，“关于……我在医院对你做的事……我……没有任何借口。”

Shinji's voice cracks as he gets to the end of his sentence and I give him a moment to compose himself, "it's okay, carry on..."  
当真嗣说到句尾时，声音开始颤抖，我给了他一点时间平复情绪，“没关系，继续说吧……”

"I could... tell you that I wasn't myself or I could blame the things that had happened to me that got me to that point but the fact is... I had a choice. I had a choice on whether or not to do it, I knew it was wrong but... I didn't stop. I violated you Asuka and I... I am so sorry for that."  
“我本可以……告诉你我当时不在状态，或者把责任推给那些把我逼到那个地步的事情，但事实是……我有过选择。我可以选择是否去做，我知道那是错的，但是……我没有停下。我侵犯了你，明日香，对此我……我深感抱歉。”

I feel my skin get prickly as I hear him say those words. It feels so weird to hear someone else talk about what happened to me. It feels weird to hear it out loud, it's like confirmation that it actually happened. I swallow and then answer, "I forgive you. I've said that to you once before, many years ago and I don't know if you believed it then. I guess not because I don't think I meant it back then. I was just trying to forget about it. I was just trying to pretend it never happened and run away from it."  
听到他说出这些话，我感到皮肤一阵刺痛。听别人谈论发生在我身上的事感觉很奇怪。大声说出来感觉更奇怪，就像是一种确认，证明那真的发生了。我咽了咽口水，然后回答道：“我原谅你。多年前我也对你说过这句话，但我不确定你当时是否相信。我想可能没有，因为我觉得那时候我并不是真心这么想的。我只是试图忘记它。我只是试图假装它从未发生过，然后逃避它。”

I pause as I cast my mind back to that moment I 'forgave' him many years ago. It was a very quick and one-sided conversation, I don't remember him participating in it at all. I had stopped him in the corridor in our apartment, I think he was on his way to the bathroom and I was about to go out. I said to him I knew what he had done and to forget about it, I said I forgave him. I walked out before he had a chance to reply to me.  
我停顿了一下，回忆起多年前我‘原谅’他的那一刻。那是一次迅速且单方面的对话，我甚至不记得他有参与其中。我在公寓的走廊拦住了他，我想他正要去洗手间，而我正准备出门。我告诉他我知道他所做的事，并让他忘掉，我说我原谅了他。没等他有机会回应，我就离开了。

I can look back on that moment with clarity now. I know fine well that wasn't really me forgiving him. At that point I had made my decision to leave, so I just wanted to give him something to feel good about before I left. The real forgiveness comes now. It is only now that I'm confronted with his words and his apologies that I can exorcise this demon within me.  
现在我可以清晰地回想起那一刻。我很清楚，那并不是真正的原谅。当时我已经决定离开，所以只是想在他离开前给他一些值得高兴的东西。真正的原谅是现在。只有现在面对他的话语和道歉，我才能驱散心中的这个恶魔。

_"T-Thank you..." “谢……谢谢你……”_

"Please, believe me when I say that. I do forgive you. You are right, there isn't any excuse for what you did. I... can't even begin to describe how it made me feel when I did find out about it. I think... it's time to let it go though, it's time we drew a line in the sand and moved on from it."  
"请相信我，我确实原谅你了。你说得对，你所做的一切没有任何借口。我……甚至无法形容当我发现这一切时的心情。但我想……是时候放下它了，是时候在沙地上划一条线，然后继续前进了。"

_"O-Okay..."_ His voice is still trembling as he speaks but there is a little bit more strength to it, _"Does... Kaworu hate me now?"_  
"好……好的……"" 他的声音仍在颤抖，但多了几分坚定，""那……薰现在讨厌我吗？"

I shake my head and let out a small sigh, "No... Kaworu doesn't hate you but he... well he isn't happy with it either. He's not quite sure how to deal with this, he had a certain... image of you I guess."  
我摇摇头，轻叹一声，""不……薰并不讨厌你，但他……嗯，他对此也不高兴。他不太确定如何处理这件事，他对你有某种……形象的期待吧。"

_"I guess... I've let him down..."  
"我想...我让他失望了..."_

"And he let you down Shinji, by betraying you and nearly destroying the world!" I answer Shinji, "All of us... we're all answering for some of the shitty things we've done in the past. Some of us more than others. Just... don't worry about Kaworu, he'll figure things out."  
"他确实让你失望了，真嗣，他背叛了你，差点毁灭了世界！"" 我回答真嗣，""我们所有人...都在为过去做的那些糟糕事付出代价。有些人比其他人更多。只是...别担心卡洛，他会想明白的。"

_"Does he... well do the two of you still want to visit?"  
"他...呃，你们俩还想一起去吗？"_

"Yes..." I let out another sigh, "You're not going to get out of seeing us that easily Shinji. We are still going to visit you and that means that you had better be at your best for it. I expect nothing less than perfection from you. If not... well then I will be mad at you."  
“是的...”我又叹了口气，“你不会那么轻易就摆脱我们的，真嗣。我们还是会来看你的，所以你最好为此做好准备。我期待你完美无缺。如果不是...那我可就要生气了。”

I hear him laugh when I say that and allow myself a quick smile, _"Thank you Asuka..."_  
我说完这话，听到他笑了，便也快速地笑了笑，“谢谢你，明日香...”

I'm about to say goodbye to him but before I do I glance down at the floor and something catches my eye. The coffee that was spilled the other day has stained the floorboards. I guess this isn't over just yet, I still have one more demon to get rid of.  
我正要向他告别，但在那之前我低头看向地板，有什么东西吸引了我的注意。前几天洒的咖啡已经把地板弄脏了。看来这事还没完，我还有一个恶魔要赶走。

I've thought quite a bit about that moment, about that strange dreamlike sequence that existed on the brink of reality. It's another moment I've tried to not think of really, but it's another one that has been pushed back into my mind for one reason or another. I can remember those moments clearly, me goading Shinji and him attacking me. I'm not even sure if it was real.  
我曾多次回想过那一刻，那个介于现实边缘的奇异梦境般的片段。这也是我试图不去深思的另一个瞬间，但由于种种原因，它又被迫回到了我的脑海中。我清楚地记得那些时刻，我挑衅真嗣，而他攻击了我。我甚至不确定那是否真实。

"Shinji... I..." I begin to speak but my voice gets caught up in my throat for a moment. I take a brief moment to calm myself down, this isn't something I ever really wanted to talk about, "There was something else I... had to speak to you about. It was... just that... well, do you remember what happened to you during Third Impact?"  
“真嗣... 我...” 我开口说话，但声音一时哽在喉咙里。我稍作镇定，这并不是我真正想谈论的事情，“还有件事我... 必须和你谈谈。那是... 就是... 呃，你还记得第三次冲击时你经历了什么吗？”

_"Every little bit of it."_ His voice darkens as he answers me, _"I... I still have nightmares about it Asuka. I can remember everything."_  
“每一个细节。” 他的声音变得低沉，回答我，“我... 我至今仍为此做噩梦，明日香。我记得一切。”

His admission doesn't really make this next part any easier. I'm scared as to how he'll react if what I say happened did actually happen between us.  
他的坦白并没有让接下来的部分变得更容易。我害怕他会如何反应，如果我所说的事情确实在我们之间发生了。

"I... remember it too." I speak, "I guess... because of how close I was to it all, I'm a little bit different to other people. I'm one of the few, maybe the only one other than you who can remember it. I just... I guess I wanted to ask you about something that happened to me... I remember this moment with you and me... arguing in the apartment."  
“我……也记得。”我开口说道，“我想……因为我和这一切如此接近，我和其他人有点不同。我是少数人之一，也许除了你之外，唯一能记得这些的人。我只是……我想问你一些发生在我身上的事情……我记得和你在一起的那个时刻……我们在公寓里争吵。”

The phone goes silent again save for the sound of his breathing. My fear has been somewhat confirmed, it was real and he does remember it.  
电话再次陷入沉默，只剩下他的呼吸声。我的恐惧在某种程度上得到了证实，那是真实的，他也记得。

_"T-That... was... real?"_ He answers, _"No... No I... I thought that was a vision... I thought... I didn't think it was real... I remember but... Asuka I... I'm sorry... I..."_  
"那...那是...真的吗？" 他回答道，"不...不，我...我以为那是一场幻觉...我以为...我不认为那是真的...我记得但是...明日香我...我很抱歉...我..."

"Shinji slow down!" I quickly and sternly cut him off, "Slow down, what do you mean you thought it wasn't real?"  
"真嗣，慢点说！" 我迅速而严厉地打断了他，"慢点说，你说的不是真的是什么意思？"

_"I... I don't... it was... all so messed up... I... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I tried... I hurt you..."  
"我...我不...那一切...都乱套了...我...我很抱歉...非常抱歉...我尝试过...我伤害了你..."_

"Shinji... calm down.", I feel a tightening on my neck but I try to ignore it. I need to hear more about this now that I have confirmation it was real. I've always been a bit uncertain as to whether or not it happened, whether it was really Shinji or just some vision sent to torture me and lead me towards what it was I thought I wanted, "I just want to know if you remember it... so I know if it really happened."  
"真嗣...冷静点。"我感觉脖子一紧，但还是尽量忽视它。既然已经确认那是真的，我现在需要了解更多。我一直有点不确定那是否发生过，是真嗣还是某种幻象来折磨我，引导我走向我认为我想要的，"我只是想知道你是否记得...这样我就知道它真的发生过。"

_"Yes... Yes, it happened..."_ Shinji confirms again, _"I was... I was in Unit 01, I had just seen you... well... you know..."_  
"是的...是的，那确实发生了..."真嗣再次确认，"我当时...我在 01 号机里，我刚看到你...嗯...你知道的..."

"Yes... I know..." I suppress a shudder at the thought of what those bastards did to me.  
"是的...我知道..."想到那些混蛋对我做的事，我抑制住一阵颤抖。

_"It's all a blur but... the Eva series was moving around me and... Rei... Lilith appeared before me. I... think I passed out or something but the next thing I knew was I was in the apartment with you. I was trying to tell you I wanted to help you but you kept on yelling at me... I thought you were just there to attack me and hurt me, I thought it was just some vision to torture me... you... you shoved me over and I..."  
"一切都模糊不清，但...《EVA》系列在我周围移动，还有...绫波...莉莉丝出现在我面前。我...我觉得我昏过去了，或者是别的什么，但接下来我知道的是，我就在公寓里和你在一起。我试图告诉你我想帮助你，但你一直在对我大喊大叫...我以为你只是来攻击我、伤害我的，我以为那只是某种折磨我的幻觉...你...你把我推开了，我..."_

I recoil once again as I remember what happened next, the deadness in his eyes as he moved towards me. I remember how my only thoughts were to encourage it and let it happen, "I remember..."  
当我再次回想起接下来发生的事情时，我不禁退缩了，他眼中那种死寂的神情向我逼近。我记得我当时唯一的念头就是鼓励它发生，让它发生，"我记得..."

_"I didn't... I didn't think it was real... If I did I... I wouldn't... I... Asuka... I'm so sorry..."_ His voice cracks as he apologizes. I shift in my seat uncomfortably as I feel tears stinging the back of my own eyes.  
"我...我没想到那是真的...如果我知道的话...我...我不会...我...明日香...我很抱歉..."他道歉时声音哽咽。我坐立不安，感觉到自己的眼泪在眼眶后刺痛。

"It... It was real..." I answer, "Thank you for... confirming it for me. I... I'm sorry it upset you."  
"它... 它是真的..." 我回答，"谢谢你... 为我确认这一点。我... 我很抱歉这让你难过。"

My hand reaches up to touch my throat as I run the tips of my fingers lightly across it. I hear a sniff from the other end of the phone that threatens to tip me over the edge.  
我的手伸上去触摸我的喉咙，我轻轻地用指尖划过它。电话那头传来一声抽泣，这几乎让我崩溃。

_"Asuka..." “明日香……”_

"I forgive you Shinji." I reply immediately, "I forgive you... It happened and neither of us knew it was real. I just... I had to know it was real. I just... need to process all of this. Please don't... don't beat yourself up about this. I do forgive you, just... let I say, lets draw a line in the sand and move on."  
"我原谅你，真嗣。" 我立刻回答，"我原谅你... 事情发生了，我们俩都不知道它是真的。我只是... 我必须知道它是真的。我只是... 需要处理这一切。请不要... 不要自责。我真的原谅你，只是... 让我说，让我们在沙地上划条线，然后继续前进。"

_"Asuka I... I'm so sorry..."  
"明日香，我... 我很抱歉..."_

"I know Shinji... I know you are... I'll... call you later okay."  
"我知道的，真嗣... 我知道你... 我... 晚点再打给你，好吗？"

_"O-Okay... goodbye." "好... 好的... 再见。"_

The line goes dead as I sit and try to process the conversation we've just had. I suppose we still have a lot to talk about and deal with when we do get to Japan. Strangely though I do feel like a weight has been lifted from me. I just hope the same can be said for Shinji.  
电话那头突然断了，我坐下来试图消化我们刚刚的对话。我想，当我们真的到达日本时，还有很多事情需要讨论和处理。不过奇怪的是，我确实感觉肩上的重担减轻了。我只希望真嗣也能有同样的感觉。

### Chapter 22: The Leavers  
第 22 章：离去者  

**1st December – Somewhere over Europe – Asuka Langley Soryu  
12 月 1 日 —— 欧洲某地上空 —— 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I look at my watch and see that we've been in the air for just over one and a half hours now. This is a flight that for the past five or so years I didn't think I'd ever take. A flight back to Japan, to visit those people I had once left behind.  
我看了看手表，发现我们已经飞行了一个半小时多一点。在过去五六年里，我从未想过自己会乘坐这趟航班。一趟返回日本的航班，去探望那些我曾经离开的人们。

I can actually feel butterflies in my stomach as the reality of it all is starting to set in. I'm on the plane, I'm in my seat, there is no longer an opportunity for me to turn around and go back. I can no longer run away from it, in ten or so hours both myself and Kaworu will step out of this plane, we will go into the terminal, collect our luggage and be met by them all in the arrivals lounge.  
我真切地感受到胃里翻腾的蝴蝶，这一切的现实感正逐渐袭来。我在飞机上，坐在座位上，再也没有机会转身回去。我无法再逃避，十几个小时后，我和渚将会走出这架飞机，进入航站楼，领取行李，在到达大厅与他们会面。

I've dreamed of such moments before, dreamed about it and had nightmares about it. So many times, I've envisioned what might happen, I'll see them all and then... they'll all tell me what an awful person I was and still am. I still have that fear, deep down, that this is what might happen but I know it won't. I just don't know what will happen, and I suppose that uncertainty frightens me.  
我曾梦想过这样的时刻，也做过关于它的噩梦。无数次，我设想可能发生的事情，我会见到他们，然后...他们会告诉我，我曾是多么糟糕的人，现在依然如此。我内心深处仍怀有这种恐惧，担心这可能会发生，但我知道不会。我只是不知道会发生什么，这种不确定性让我害怕。

Will I be as I am now or will a part of me regress into that Asuka of so many years ago? I guess in ten hours we'll find out.  
我会保持现在的样子，还是有一部分我会退回到多年前那个明日香的状态？我想十小时后我们就会知道了。

I know things will be awkward, aside from Rei these are all people who I literally haven't seen since I left. I don't even know what any of them look like now. All I have of them is that image of how they were when I was fourteen. Misato, Shinji, Hikari... hell even the stooges, none of them have aged in my mind. It'll be strange to see them all again, will I recognize them? Will they recognize me?  
我知道事情会变得尴尬，除了丽，这些人都是我离开后几乎没再见过的。我甚至不知道他们现在长什么样。关于他们的记忆，只停留在他们十四岁时的模样。美里、真嗣、光……甚至连那几个跟班，在我的脑海里都没有变老。再次见到他们会很奇怪，我能认出他们吗？他们会认出我吗？

Heh, stupid question, I guess. Of course, I'll get recognized, I don't think there are many redheads walking around in Japan, we do tend to stand out. Still... it is weird to think that will all look different to how they were when I last saw them. Shinji in particular, to me I can't imagine how he might have changed. To me, he is still that meek looking fourteen-year-old that I spoke to and left behind many years ago.  
呵，这问题真傻，我想。当然，我会被认出来，我不觉得日本有很多红头发的人，我们确实容易引人注目。不过……想到他们都会变得和上次见面时不同，还是觉得奇怪。尤其是真嗣，我无法想象他会变成什么样。对我来说，他依旧是那个多年前我交谈过并离开的胆怯的十四岁少年。

I admit, I have thought about how he might have aged. Will he have grown his hair longer? Grown any facial hair? Did he get much taller? Did he fill out? Is he more muscular? Knowing the way Shinji is I actually can't imagine him changing much, all I can imagine is him looking a little bit older but being exactly the same as I knew him.  
我承认，我曾想过他会如何成长。他会留长发吗？会长胡子吗？长高了吗？身材变壮了吗？肌肉发达了吗？了解真嗣的性格，我实在想象不出他会有多大变化，只能想象他看起来稍微老了一些，但依旧和我认识的他一模一样。

Maybe I should have asked him for a photo when we were speaking. I could have asked him or Rei but the thought never cross my mind. In some way I'm glad I didn't, it'll be more of a surprise and more fun this way.  
也许我本该在我们交谈时请他拍张照片的。我可以问他或丽，但这个念头从未闪过我的脑海。在某种程度上，我很庆幸没有这么做，这样会更有惊喜感，也更有趣。

There is someone else I need to consider in this as well. I move my hand and let it rest gently on top of that person's hand, I let my fingers entwine with his and watch him as he turns around and gives me a nervous smile. I saw nothing as he turns back around to look out of the window, he has his earphones in anyway so he likely wouldn't have heard me, so I just gently squeeze his hand.  
在这件事上，我还需要考虑另一个人。我移动我的手，轻轻地放在那个人的手上，让我的手指与他交缠，看着他转过身来，给了我一个紧张的微笑。当他转回身去望向窗外时，我什么也没看到，反正他戴着耳机，很可能没听到我的话，所以我只是轻轻地握了握他的手。

I wonder what he is thinking or feeling right now. He seems to be in awe of the sights outside the window. I suppose I can understand why, this is the first time he's properly seen the world from this perspective. He has been on planes before but they were military craft and he was confined to a windowless section. He's never been able to just... enjoy it.  
我不知道他现在在想什么或感受如何。他似乎被窗外的景色所震撼。我想我能理解原因，这是他第一次从这个角度真正看到世界。他以前坐过飞机，但那是军用飞机，他被限制在一个没有窗户的区域。他从未有机会……只是享受这一切。

I'm content to let him enjoy it as much as possible. I know he must be nervous about the people we're going to see and this whole experience. He is stepping back into a world in which he feels he is still seen as an enemy. I admit, I do share that worry a little bit. I remember how he was attacked by those supposed to protect him, I know that he might have enemies out there.  
我乐意让他尽可能享受这一切。我知道他一定对即将见到的人和这次经历感到紧张。他正踏入一个仍视他为敌人的世界。我承认，我也确实有点担心。我记得那些本应保护他的人是如何攻击他的，我知道他可能在外面树敌。

Still, I don't think anything will really happen to him. I think he's safe and it's not like Shinji or his friends are going to say anything. If they do... then I suppose we just tell them his story. We tell them why what happened, happened and explain it. People seemed to forgive me and my nastiness quickly when they learned of my story.  
不过，我认为他真的不会有事。我觉得他是安全的，而且真嗣或他的朋友们也不会说什么。如果他们真的说了...那我们就告诉他们他的故事。我们解释为什么会发生那些事，并说明原因。人们似乎在我讲述我的故事后很快就原谅了我的恶劣行径。

I know what Kaworu did is probably seen as worse than me being a bit of an asshole. He is someone who betrayed a person as their lowest point and nearly destroyed this world but... that isn't what he wanted and isn't who he is. I can't imagine this kind and loving soul next to me as getting close to doing anything like that.  
我知道，相较于我有点混蛋的行为，卡哇兰所做的可能被视为更严重。他在一个人最低谷时背叛了对方，差点毁灭了这个世界，但...那不是他想要的，也不是他的本性。我无法想象身边这个善良而充满爱心的人会接近做出那样的事。

Kaworu has... been invaluable to me since I met him. We truly make each other better people and I just hope the others can see that as well.  
自从遇见渚薰，他对我来说...一直非常宝贵。我们确实让彼此成为了更好的人，我只希望其他人也能看到这一点。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

I feel the warmth of Asuka's hand as she places it gently on top of mine and slips her fingers in between my own. I turn for a moment and shoot her a nervous smile before looking back out of the window at the land below. Strangely I'm feeling more nervous about this flight, I didn't think I would be a nervous flyer, after all I've technically done it twice before and I've piloted a giant bio-mechanical weapon.  
我感受到明日香手的温暖，她轻轻地将手放在我的手上，手指滑入我的指间。我转过头，向她投去一个紧张的微笑，然后再次望向窗外下方的土地。奇怪的是，我对这次飞行感到更加紧张，我本以为自己不会是一个紧张的飞行者，毕竟从技术上讲，我已经飞过两次，还驾驶过巨大的生物机械武器。

Yet, this feels different somehow. Maybe because the previous two times I've flown it's been in military craft and I've been too out of it to care. The first time was when I was Kaworu Nagisa the Angel, Tabris and more dulled to emotion and fear. The second time I was too fearful of my situation and not in a craft like this to really think too much about it.  
然而，不知为何，这次感觉不同。也许是因为前两次飞行都是在军用飞行器上，而且我当时太过恍惚，不在乎这些。第一次是我作为天使渚薰，塔布里斯，情感和恐惧都变得迟钝。第二次我太过害怕自己的处境，而且不是在这样的飞行器上，所以没有太多思考。

This time I'm in a proper domestic craft, I'm surrounded by people and I can see the land below me as we fly high over the Earth. Familiar fears creep back in, do these people know who I am? Some of them do, some of them are here specifically to keep an eye on me but I know nothing is going to happen. What can happen? Someone attacks me when I go to the toilet? I don't think so.  
这次我乘坐的是一架正规的民用飞机，周围都是人，我可以从高空俯瞰下方的陆地。熟悉的恐惧感悄然回归，这些人知道我是谁吗？有些人知道，有些人特意在这里监视我，但我明白什么都不会发生。能发生什么呢？有人在我上厕所时袭击我？我不这么认为。

At the same time, despite my nervousness the view from the window is mesmerizing. It's a clear day and I can see the ground below without issue, I can see us flying over a town and it is so bizarre to me to know that in the few minutes it'll take for the song I've got on to come to an end I'll have flown over thousands of people living their lives.  
与此同时，尽管我感到紧张，窗外的景色却令人着迷。今天天气晴朗，我可以毫无障碍地看到地面，看到我们飞越一个小镇，这对我来说非常奇怪，因为只需几分钟，我耳机里的歌曲就会结束，而我将飞越成千上万人的生活。

I let my mind wander a little bit, to imagine what all of those people might be doing right now, to what those people might be thinking of feeling. Which of them are happy right now? Are any of them about to make a life chnaging decision for better or worse? Are they saying goodbye to someone or welcoming someone new into the world? Are people falling in love for the first time or perhaps more sadly moving on from love to something else?  
我让自己的思绪稍稍飘远，想象着那些人此刻可能在做什么，他们在想什么、感受什么。他们中有谁现在感到快乐？是否有人即将做出改变命运的决定，无论是好是坏？他们在告别某人还是迎接新生命的到来？有人第一次坠入爱河，或者更悲伤地，从爱情转向其他事物？

Or are they simply just looking up as this plane passes overhead and perhaps wondering what the people on board are doing and where we're going?  
还是说，他们只是抬头看着这架飞机从头顶飞过，或许在想机上的人们在做什么，我们要去往何方？

These people... they would not be here today if I hadn't been stopped so many years ago. If Shinji hadn't have stopped me then the people of that town we've passed, the people on board thise plane... they would not be travelling, they would not be happy or sad, they would not be falling in or out of love, they would not be able to welcome someone new into their world. There would simply be nothing.  
这些人……如果多年前我没有被阻止，他们今天就不会在这里。如果真嗣当时没有阻止我，那么我们经过的那个小镇的居民，这架飞机上的人们……他们就不会旅行，不会经历喜怒哀乐，不会坠入爱河或走出情伤，不会有机会迎接新生命进入他们的世界。一切都将化为乌有。

Naturally... my mind now wanders towards thoughts of Shinji, the one who did stop me, the one who did give this world it's second chance, who ultimately allowed for me to have a second chance, whether he knew about it or not.  
自然而然地……我的思绪飘向了真嗣，那个阻止了我的人，那个给了这个世界第二次机会的人，最终也让我有了第二次机会，无论他是否知情。

My feelings for Shinji are still somewhat complicated I suppose you could say. I've been struggling over the last month to reconcile the Shinji I thought I knew with the Shinji I have been told about by Asuka and others with the Shinji he has admitted himself to be. I have been trying to remind myself constantly that one bad act does not define who we are going forward, it is a person's willingness to learn and grow from their mistakes that defines them.  
我对真嗣的感情，或许可以说依然颇为复杂。过去一个月里，我一直在努力调和那个我以为我了解的真嗣，与明日香和其他人所描述的真嗣，以及他自认的真嗣之间的差异。我不断提醒自己，一个错误的行为并不能决定我们未来的身份，真正定义一个人的，是他们从错误中学习并成长的意愿。

Yes, there are perhaps some acts that are very difficult to forgive or perhaps cannot be forgiven but I do not think Shinji is guilty of such a thing and others do not seem to think that is the case either. Still, it is so easy to get lost within my own thoughts on these subjects. It is so easy to envision scenarios that are yet to play out and direct them a certain way based on my mood on that day.  
是的，有些行为或许难以原谅，甚至无法原谅，但我不认为真嗣犯下了这样的错误，其他人似乎也不这么认为。尽管如此，在这些事情上迷失在自己的思绪中是如此容易。设想那些尚未上演的情景，并根据当天的心情将其引向某个方向，也是如此简单。

The fact is that when it comes down to it, I want Shinji in my life and I want to see him forgiven for the bad things he has done. I view it no different now to him and others wanting me in their lives and forgiving me for what I have done. I want there to be a strong bond of friendship between the two of us. Perhaps it will be awkward and we will question ourselves and each other but I do not think it unachievable.  
事实是，归根结底，我希望真嗣能出现在我的生活中，并希望他能被原谅他所做的那些坏事。我现在看待这件事，与他和别人希望我出现在他们的生活中并原谅我所做的一切，并无不同。我希望我们之间能建立起牢固的友谊。也许这会有些尴尬，我们会自我怀疑和互相质疑，但我认为这并非不可能实现。

I am worried about how things will be initially between us though. I worry about what reception I will get when me and Asuka go into that arrivals lounge and see him for the first time. I wonder what it will be like when I meet his guardian and his friends. I am fearful that they will not treat me as fairly as he has. I am also worried... perhaps illogically about what will happen when he sees Asuka again.  
不过，我担心我们最初相处的情况。我担心当我与明日香走进到达大厅，第一次见到他时，会得到怎样的接待。我不知道当我见到他的监护人和朋友时会是什么样子。我害怕他们不会像他那样公平地对待我。我还担心……或许有些不合逻辑，他再次见到明日香时会发生什么。

It feels wrong of me to be concerned about such a thing. I don't want to be jealous of their bond and feel I have no right to be. What they have is special and I should be okay with that but I still feel some pangs of jealousy when she talks about him. I see her eyes light up, I see her smile and when I talk to him, I can hear the joy in his voice when she is mentioned. There is a spark between the two of them that has never gone out and sometimes I feel I am just in the way of what should be.  
我担心这种事情似乎不太对劲。我不想嫉妒他们之间的羁绊，觉得自己没有权利这样。他们拥有的关系很特别，我应该接受这一点，但当她谈论他时，我仍会感到一丝嫉妒的刺痛。我看到她的眼睛闪闪发光，看到她的笑容，而当我与他交谈时，我能听出提到她时他声音中的喜悦。他们之间有一种永不熄灭的火花，有时我觉得自己只是挡在了本该属于他们的道路上。

I have not, of course, ever confessed these feelings of jealousy to Asuka. I know they are mostly illogical conclusions brought on by my fears and insecurities. After all, Asuka has demonstrated her love for me several times and I know they were true. I know there is a strong bond between me and Asuka so those fears about her and Shinji are illogical and something I just need to work through.  
当然，我从未向明日香坦白过这些嫉妒的情绪。我知道这些大多是出于我的恐惧和不安全感而产生的非理性结论。毕竟，明日香多次向我展示了她对我的爱，我知道那是真心的。我知道我和明日香之间有着牢固的纽带，所以对她和真嗣的担忧是不合逻辑的，只是我需要克服的问题。

Still... I do wonder, what if I am in the way? I have such love for them both and I want them to be happy? I do not wish to be without them but I also... would not want to stand in the way of their happiness either. If that spark were ignited... what would I do?  
尽管如此...我确实在想，如果我挡了道怎么办？我对他们俩都充满了爱，希望他们幸福。我不希望失去他们，但同时...也不想妨碍他们的幸福。如果那火花被点燃...我会怎么做？

I look at the screen in front of me, it will do me no good to get lost inside my own head regarding this subject, especially not for the duration of this flight. Instead I will watch something and I will get some rest.  
我看着面前的屏幕，关于这个话题，迷失在自己的思绪中对我毫无益处，尤其是在这次飞行期间。相反，我会看些东西，然后休息一下。

I will see you soon Shinji.  
很快就能见到你了，真嗣。

**2nd December – Tokyo 2 International Airport – Early Morning – Shinji Ikari  
12 月 2 日 – 东京 2 号国际机场 – 清晨 – 碇真嗣**

My eyes look upwards towards the digital screen above me as I try to find their flight and its arrival time. I eventually find it and see that it should be arriving in just under half an hour. This is it I suppose, this is these are the final moments I'll have before seeing the two of them once more. I never expected that I would see either of them ever again.  
我的目光向上投向头顶的数字屏幕，试图寻找他们的航班及其到达时间。最终找到了，看到它应该在不到半小时后抵达。我想这就是了，这将是我在再次见到他们之前的最后时刻。我从未想过会再次见到他们中的任何一个。

I didn't think I'd ever see Asuka again, I thought she had left and would never be in contact again. I had resigned myself to that fact and didn't blame her. As far as Kaworu goes he... well he died. People don't normally come back from that, unless you're Misato... or Asuka... or Rei... did Rei die? I'm not quite sure that what happened to her counts as dying.  
我没想到会再次见到明日香，我以为她已经离开，再也不会联系了。我已经接受了这一事实，并不怪她。至于渚薰，他……嗯，他去世了。人们通常不会从那中回来，除非你是美里……或者明日香……或者绫波……绫波死了吗？我不太确定她经历的算不算死亡。

I suppose none of that really matters. All that matters is that the two of them are on that flight and I will be seeing them shortly. This is... a big deal to me and it feels surreal that the day has finally come. It's been rare in my life that I've looked forward to an event. Normally the days just pass me by, I never really get excited for my birthday or for Christmas. Those things are just days for me but today... today is special. I'm excited and... I'm nervous.  
我想这些都不重要了。重要的是他们俩在那架航班上，我很快就会见到他们。这对我来说……意义重大，感觉这一天终于到来，真是不可思议。在我的生活中，很少有期待某个事件的时候。通常日子就这样流逝，我从未真正为生日或圣诞节感到兴奋。那些对我来说只是普通的日子，但今天……今天很特别。我感到兴奋……也感到紧张。

This year has been unusual for me. In a way it feels like I've lived most of my life in the past few months, almost like I've been drifting through life from the moment of Third Impact through to now. Since Asuka came back into my life I've dealt with so many things, I've opened up about so much, had so many uncomfortable conversations, learned a whole concerts worth of music and started down a pathway towards rebuilding two friendships.  
这一年对我来说非同寻常。在某种程度上，我感觉过去几个月里我仿佛活了大半辈子，几乎像是自第三次冲击以来一直漂泊至今。自从明日香重新回到我的生活，我经历了太多事情，敞开了许多心扉，进行了无数次令人不适的对话，学会了一整场音乐会的曲目，并开始走上重建两段友谊的道路。

It has all been so very awkward and many times I've felt like running away from it. So many times, I've felt like letting myself regress and give in to those voices in my head that tell me I'm only going to get hurt by opening up, give in to those voices that tell me I don't deserve love or friendship but I know Asuka... I know Kaworu and so many others are fighting that same battle, so I have to fight as well.  
这一切都如此尴尬，许多次我都想逃离。无数次，我感到自己想退缩，屈服于那些告诉我敞开心扉只会受伤的声音，屈服于那些说我配不上爱或友谊的声音，但我知道明日香...我知道薰和许多其他人也在进行同样的斗争，所以我必须战斗。

I'm scared about seeing them both in person though. Up until now we've only spoken by the phone or by e-mail and that has been difficult enough. Will it be harder now that we're face to face? Will I be unable to stop myself regressing? Will I be able to say what I want to?  
然而，我害怕与他们面对面相见。直到现在，我们只能通过电话或电子邮件交流，这已经够困难了。面对面会不会更难？我会不会无法阻止自己退缩？我能否说出我想说的？

"How are you feeling?" I hear Rei's soft voice suddenly behind me. I turn around to face her and nod my head.  
“你感觉怎么样？”丽的声音突然在我身后响起。我转过身面对她，点了点头。

"Yeah... I'm okay, thank you Rei."  
“嗯……我还好，谢谢你，丽。”

She nods back and hands me a cup of coffee, I resist the urge to yelp out in pain as my fingertips close around the plastic cup. It is strange to me that with all the advances in technology companies still haven't developed a coffee cup that doesn't burn your fingers on contact. I was able to dive into a volcano in Unit 01 and come away with only a few superficial burns, yet my fingertips feel like they're about to be burned off by holding this thing for five seconds.  
她点头回应，递给我一杯咖啡，我强忍住痛呼的冲动，手指紧紧握住塑料杯。奇怪的是，尽管科技进步如此之大，公司仍未开发出一种不会烫伤手指的咖啡杯。我曾驾驶初号机潜入火山，只受了些皮外伤，然而现在仅仅握住这东西五秒钟，我的指尖却感觉快要被烧掉了。

"They will be arriving soon. I am nervous." Rei states and admits as we make our way towards an empty set of seats and sit ourselves down.  
"他们很快就要到了。我很紧张。" 丽说道，我们走向一组空座位坐下。

"I'm nervous too... about seeing the both of them. It's been so many years." I admit to her, "I'm worried I'll say the wrong thing and upset them or I'll... get upset myself and... well you know."  
"我也一样紧张... 见到他们两个。已经过去这么多年了。" 我向她坦白，"我担心会说错话，让他们不高兴，或者我自己会... 情绪失控，你知道的。"

"Yes, I understand." Rei nods her head, "I too was scared of such things when I managed to track down Asuka a few years ago. I was worried that despite my developments in interacting with people it would still not be enough to converse with her. I was concerned that she would still harbor negative feelings towards me. I had planned out conversations in my head that I feared would not pan out the way I wanted them to."  
"是的，我理解。" 丽点点头，"几年前我找到明日香的时候，我也害怕这些。我担心尽管我在与人交往方面有所进步，但仍然不足以和她交谈。我担心她对我仍有负面情绪。我在脑海中预演了对话，担心它们不会如我所愿地进行。"

"It wasn't a waste of time though, was it?" I ask her, "I mean... you two became close friends after that, didn't you?"  
"不过那并不是浪费时间，对吧？" 我问她，"我的意思是... 你们俩在那之后成了亲密的朋友，不是吗？"

"Yes, we did but things also did not pan out how I had expected. There was a lot more emotion on both sides than I had expected. In a way this was tougher but I think it was better. I think that... the three of you will be fine, much in the same way that Asuka and I were fine. It will be awkward for you all at first and I would advise you do not expect things to go as you might think they will but... I believe you will all be fine."  
"是的，我们确实如此，但事情并没有像我预期的那样发展。双方的感情都比我预想的要多得多。从某种程度上说，这更艰难，但我认为这样更好。我想... 你们三个也会没事的，就像我和明日香一样。起初你们都会感到尴尬，我建议你们不要期望事情会按照你们想象的那样发展，但... 我相信你们都会没事的。"

"Thank you." I answer her and smile, "You know it's funny but... I don't even know what they look like. I have an idea of it but I never got a new picture of them or anything. I keep on expecting Kaworu to be in the same thing he was when I met him. I keep on thinking Asuka will be the same as she was before she left."  
"谢谢你。" 我回答她并微笑，"你知道这很滑稽，但... 我甚至不知道他们现在长什么样。我有个大概的印象，但我从未收到过他们的新照片或什么的。我一直期待着薰还是我第一次见他时的样子。我一直以为明日香还是她离开前的样子。"

I turn to see Rei smile, "Asuka is... a very beautiful woman. As for Kaworu he... well I have only seen pictures but he is very handsome. Neither of them have changed too much, they are much like myself and you in that regard."  
我转头看到丽微笑着说：“明日香是个非常美丽的女人。至于薰...我只看过照片，但他非常英俊。他们俩都没怎么变，在这点上和我们自己很像。”

"I see..." “我明白了...”

I sip from my coffee as Rei takes a moment to look at her phone, "They should be landing in fifteen minutes. Whilst I remember, you are still okay with the plans for Asuka's Birthday, aren't you?"  
我啜饮着咖啡，丽看了一会儿手机，“他们应该在十五分钟后降落。趁我记得，你还是同意明日香生日计划的，对吧？”

"Yeah." I confirm, "I'll go shopping the day before and get everything I need to for the cake and food. You... You're arranged everything else, right?"  
"嗯。" 我确认道，"我会在前一天去购物，准备好做蛋糕和食物所需的一切。你...你已经安排好其他所有事情了，对吧？"

"Yes." She answers me, "I have contacted her hotel and booked the appropriate rooms, I have confirmed the event with Fuyutsuki, invited our friends and I have gotten the gifts and cards we discussed. I have even been able to arrange a trip for them during the afternoon, this should give us the appropriate time to go to their hotel and set everything up."  
"是的。" 她回答我，"我已经联系了她的酒店并预订了合适的房间，我与冬月确认了活动细节，邀请了我们的朋友，还准备好了我们讨论过的礼物和卡片。我甚至安排了他们下午的行程，这样我们应该有足够的时间去他们的酒店布置一切。"

"Y-You've really thought this through, haven't you?"  
"你真的考虑得很周到，不是吗？"

She nods, "Yes but I also expect others to play their part, I do not want our plans to go awry due to one person making a mistake. That is why I have limited the number of people directly involved and is also why I have not informed Nagisa of the plans."  
她点头，“是的，但我同样期望其他人能尽到自己的职责，我不希望我们的计划因某人的失误而失败。这就是为什么我只限制了直接参与的人数，也是为什么我没有告诉渚计划的原因。”

"S-Shouldn't he know?" “他不应该知道吗？”

"Perhaps, but I fear, knowing what I do about Nagisa that he would let things slip. I have learned that despite his appearance and past, Nagisa has proven himself to be somewhat clumsy both physically and verbally. Therefore, I have limited his involvement to bystander." Rei replies calmly, "In truth I was hesitant to even let you and Misato in on my plans but Misato has access to Fuyutsuki and you are able to produce the ideal cake for the situation. I am sure you understand."  
“或许吧，但根据我对渚的了解，我担心他会不小心泄露消息。尽管他外表和过去看起来如此，渚已经证明自己在行动和言语上都有些笨拙。因此，我限制了他的参与，只让他作为旁观者。”丽平静地回答，“说实话，我甚至犹豫是否要让你们和美里参与我的计划，但美里能接触到冬月，而你能做出适合这种情况的理想蛋糕。我相信你能理解。”

"I... I think so?" I answer, somewhat confused and hurt by her words but also... understanding them in some strange way. Still I can't help but be somewhat fearful of the way she speaks.  
“我...我想是的？”我回答道，有些困惑和受伤于她的话语，但同时...又以某种奇怪的方式理解她。尽管如此，我还是忍不住对她说话的方式感到有些害怕。

Not as fearful of what is going to happen shortly. It's dawning on me that this is actually going to happen now, even if I want to, I'd be unable to run away from it now.  
不如说，我更害怕即将发生的事情。我渐渐意识到，这真的要发生了，即使我想逃避，现在也逃不掉了。

My mind quickly goes back to my first meetings with them. The first time I saw Asuka was on the 'Over the Rainbow', we were picking up Unit 02 and as a treat Misato had allowed me to bring Touji and Kensuke along. I can still remember that first encounter with her in detail, I remember hearing her voice for the first time, I remember seeing her stood in front of us on that deck in her yellow sundress. I can remember at first thinking just how pretty she was.  
我的思绪迅速回到了与他们初次见面的时刻。第一次见到明日香是在‘彩虹之上’，我们正在接管二号机，而美里允许我带上真治和健介作为奖励。我仍然清楚地记得与她第一次相遇的细节，我记得第一次听到她的声音，记得她穿着黄色太阳裙站在甲板前的样子。我记得最初只是觉得她非常漂亮。

I can also remember that gust of wind and the stinging sensation on my cheek barely seconds later. I had turned away as well! Unlike Touji and Kensuke but I guess that didn't matter to Asuka back then. That confirmed to me that she was not going to be easy to get along with. Not too long after that we were fighting side by side in the cockpit of Unit 02 and I was wearing one of her spare plugsuits. Not quite the best first encounter with someone.  
我还能记得那阵风，以及几乎紧接着划过脸颊的刺痛感。我也转过身去了！不像真嗣和健介，但我想那时这对明日香来说并不重要。这让我确信她不是个容易相处的人。没过多久，我们就在二号机的驾驶舱里并肩作战，我穿着她的一件备用插入栓服。这可真不是与某人初次相遇的最佳方式。

Yet... she didn't leave my mind and the truth is that she was not easy to get along with. Especially not at first, she was everything I wasn't and went against everything I had known grown up. She was part Japanese but she certainly didn't show much of that side. She was loud and arrogant, she complained and questioned everything and she seemed so selfish. She was all those things I had been warned that foreigners could be.  
然而...她始终萦绕在我心头，事实是她确实不易相处。尤其是刚开始，她的一切都与我截然相反，与我成长中所知的一切背道而驰。她有日本血统，但她显然没有表现出太多那一面。她吵闹且自大，她抱怨、质疑一切，显得如此自私。她就是那些我曾被告知外国人可能会有的所有特质。

A part of me liked it though because Asuka was... Asuka and she didn't seem ashamed of it. Yes, she could be slobbish, loud and obnoxious but I saw more than that. Asuka wasn't afraid to speak her mind, she pointed out when things seemed unfair or stupid. She didn't believe in tradition for traditions sake and I also saw moments that others didn't. I saw kindness from her, I saw vulnerability. I saw her strive to include everything, part of the reason our group was so close was because she made sure everyone was included. People forget that.  
虽然我的一部分对此感到喜欢，因为明日香就是...明日香，她对此并不感到羞愧。是的，她可能邋遢、吵闹又令人讨厌，但我看到了更多。明日香敢于直言，她会在事情显得不公或愚蠢时指出来。她不迷信传统，只为了传统本身。我也看到了别人看不到的时刻。我看到了她的善良，看到了她的脆弱。我看到了她努力包容一切，这也是我们小组如此亲密的原因之一，因为她确保每个人都包括在内。人们常常忘记这一点。

She was also... honest with me. She didn't treat me differently because I was a pilot or the son of the commander. She treated me like Shinji Ikari, a friend and comrade. She would push me to stand up for myself, she'd push me to get better scores in the Eva and challenge me to do better in school. It seemed like she genuinely wanted to help me.  
她对我也很...诚实。她没有因为我是一名驾驶员或指挥官的儿子而区别对待我。她把我当作真嗣，一个朋友和战友。她会推动我为自己挺身而出，她会推动我在 Eva 中取得更好的成绩，并挑战我在学校做得更好。她似乎真心想帮助我。

When I met Kaworu I was in a very different place. Life was complicated when I met Asuka but it was even more so when I met Kaworu. I was in a dark place, it was just after Asuka had been hospitalized and I had learned some of the truth about Rei and the Eva's. I can remember standing at the side fo a lake in the Geofront, I had little to think about except for how much I wanted it all to end.  
当我遇见渚薰时，我正处于一个截然不同的境地。生活在我遇见明日香时已经很复杂，但遇见渚薰时更是如此。我身处黑暗之中，就在明日香住院之后，我得知了一些关于绫波和 EVA 的真相。我记得自己站在地底湖边，除了渴望这一切结束之外，我几乎没有什么可想的。

I can remember the moment I thought about diving into that pool was the moment I heard him humming a tune. I turned my head and saw him sat up on top of a rock, smiling at me. I can remember how my heart started to race on seeing him, I can remember how my first thoughts were how attractive he was. Kaworu saved me on that day, it was almost as if he was heaven sent... I suppose in a way he was.  
我记得当我考虑跳进那个水池的那一刻，我听到了他哼唱的旋律。我转过头，看到他坐在一块岩石上，对着我微笑。我记得看到他时心跳加速的感觉，我记得我最初的念头是他多么迷人。渚薰在那一天救了我，仿佛他是上天派来的...我想在某种程度上，他的确是。

I still blush a bit when I think about how I felt when I saw Kaworu, even now I can feel that redness coming to my cheeks. The idea of romance scared me back then, it does now to be honest. Relationships and sexuality weren't topics to be discussed, I grew up in a small town that didn't talk about things like that. Our society doesn't speak about things like that, I had no guidance in terms of relationships or sex, I never questioned it either.  
每当我回想起初见渚薰时的那份悸动，脸上仍会泛起一丝红晕。即便现在，我对浪漫情感的恐惧依旧如初。在那个小镇上，恋爱和性的话题从未被提及，我就是在这样一个环境中长大。我们的社会也不谈论这些，关于恋爱或性，我从未得到过任何指引，也从未对此产生过疑问。

Kaworu made me question myself though, on that day I felt something for him, I felt a genuine romantic attraction and that scared me. It was the same attraction I felt for Asuka, a desire to be around them, to hold them and be with them. All those things I was afraid of.  
然而，渚薰让我开始自我质疑，那天我对他产生了真挚的浪漫情愫，这让我感到害怕。那种感觉与我对明日香的感情如出一辙，渴望亲近他们，拥抱他们，与他们在一起。所有这些我曾畏惧的情感。

I never really believed it was wrong to be gay or bisexual, I was never brought up to believe it was a bad thing. I just wasn't brought up to really think of it as a thing. It was, as I said, just not spoken about. I just grew up drifting through life, I never thought about myself or what I was or could be really. So, it shocked me a bit when I started to have those feelings.  
我从未真正认为同性恋或双性恋是错误的，我从小就没有被灌输过这是不好的观念。只是，我从未被引导去认真思考这个问题。如我所说，这些话题从未被提及。我就像随波逐流般长大，从未深入思考过自己是谁，或者可能成为什么样的人。因此，当我开始产生这些情感时，确实让我有些震惊。

I've accepted over the years that I am bisexual, perhaps its bad but I still don't really speak about it. Misato and Rei know but I've never really pursued romance with anyone, so it's never really came up. Back then though, it frightened me, I was frightened of everything and that was just one more thing to add to the pile.  
多年来，我已接受了自己是双性恋的事实，或许这不好，但我仍未真正谈及此事。美里和丽知道，但我从未真正追求过与任何人的浪漫关系，所以这从未真正成为话题。但那时，这让我感到恐惧，我对一切都感到害怕，这只是又一件让我忧心的事。

Kaworu helped to keep that fear at bay. There was just something about him that helped me feel safe. It made me feeling like other people and their thoughts and expectations of me didn't matter, so long as he was there. I was so comfortable talking to him about my life, my mother, my father and my past. I was happy to reveal things to him that I had not done to anyone else at that time.  
渚薰帮我驱散了那份恐惧。他身上有某种特质让我感到安心。这让我觉得，只要他在，别人的想法和对我期望都不重要了。我很乐意与他谈论我的生活、我的母亲、父亲和过去。那时，我愿意向他透露连别人都不曾知晓的事情。

It didn't last though, the next day Kaworu revealed what he really was and I was forced to kill him. In the time it had taken me to meet and fall in love with this person I had already lost them and love turned to something darker.  
然而，这并未持续下去，第二天渚薰揭示了他的真实身份，我被迫杀了他。在相识并爱上这个人的短暂时间里，我已失去了他，爱意转变成了某种更黑暗的东西。

So now I stand here in this airport, looking at the time on my phone as I wait for these two people to arrive. I have no idea what I'm going to say to either of them, I have no idea what I'm going to do when I see them. I'm a little bit scared but I'm also confident that today will be the start of a brand-new chapter in all our lives, a much better one.  
于是此刻，我站在这机场，盯着手机上的时间，等待着这两个人的到来。我完全不知道该对他们说些什么，也不知道见到他们后该做什么。我有些害怕，但同时也自信今天将是开启我们所有人崭新篇章的开始，一个更好的篇章。

Just five minutes left. 只剩五分钟了。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I watch in frustration as more luggage slowly moves past me on the carousel. I've been waiting here for fifteen minutes now, watched as smug businessmen and irritating families have gleefully marched forward and gotten their bags without issue. I hope they haven't lost the damn things, they better not have lost the damn thing.  
我懊恼地看着一件件行李缓慢地从我面前经过的传送带。我已经在这里等了十五分钟，看着那些自得的商务人士和烦人的家庭欢快地走上前，毫无问题地取走他们的行李。我希望他们没把那该死的东西弄丢，他们最好没弄丢那该死的东西。

I'm starting to grow impatient, I barely slept on the flight over here. I've never been good at sleeping whilst in transport. When I was younger and I went on coach trips I couldn't sleep, when we brought Unit 02 over on the 'Over The Rainbow' I couldn't sleep and whenever I've flown long distance I've not been able to sleep.  
我开始变得不耐烦了，飞来这里的途中我几乎没怎么睡。我向来不擅长在交通工具上睡觉。小时候参加长途汽车旅行时我睡不着，当我们把二号机运过‘彩虹之上’时我也睡不着，每次长途飞行我都无法入睡。

Finally, I see what appears to be my luggage, I rush forward and quickly check the tags to confirm before pulling it off and away from its circular hell. I set it down gently on the floor and wheel it back across to a clearer area. A short distance away I spot Kaworu still looking out for his luggage to make an appearance.  
终于，我看到了似乎是我的行李，我快步上前迅速检查标签确认后，将其从旋转的困境中拉出。我轻轻地将它放在地板上，推到更空旷的地方。不远处，我看到渚薰还在寻找他的行李出现。

As I wait, I turn and give a brief look towards the exit to the arrivals lounge. I try to look through the doorway as it opens for any sign of Shinji and Rei. Neither of them visible to me at this time.  
我一边等待，一边转身向到达大厅的出口望去。我试图透过门口的开合寻找真嗣和绫波的身影。但此时他们俩都未出现在我的视线中。

My heart is beating so fast in my chest now as the nerves and reality of the situation take hold. It annoys me, why the hell am I so nervous about this? Why am I nervous about seeing Shinji again or being here? Why is this affecting me so goddamn much? I'm Asuka Langley Soryu damnit, stared down hellish creatures hellbent on ending this world with minimal fear.  
此刻，我的心跳得如此之快，紧张和现实的情境紧紧抓住了我。这让我恼火，我他妈的为什么这么紧张？为什么我会对再次见到真嗣或回到这里感到紧张？为什么这对我影响如此之大？我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，面对着一心要毁灭世界的可怕生物，我几乎没有恐惧。

I fought to protect this world. I fought until my very last breath. I shouldn't be afraid of seeing one person. I shouldn't be afraid of being here. This is nothing to someone like me.  
我为保护这个世界而战。我战斗到最后一口气。我不应该害怕见到一个人。我不应该害怕待在这里。这对像我这样的人来说算不了什么。

It looks like Kaworu finally has his luggage, he sets it down and wheels it over to stand with me. I see the fear in his eyes as he looks at me, I give him a small smile and reach out for his hand to calm him down. We stand for a few more moments as he smiles back, "They're watching us, aren't they?"  
看来渚薰终于拿到了他的行李，他把行李放下，推着它走到我身边。我看到他眼中的恐惧，便对他微微一笑，伸出手去安抚他。我们又站了一会儿，他回以微笑，“他们在看着我们，对吧？”

We both look around and I see the reasons behind the fear in his eyes and the question. The 'they' he is asking about are much clearer now, they didn't even make an effort to blend in. Stereotypical black suits and speaking into radios. So, these are the members of the security team that'll be watching our every movement and following us from place to place.  
我们俩环顾四周，我明白了他的眼中为何充满恐惧，以及那个疑问的缘由。他询问的“他们”现在更加清晰了，这些人甚至没有试图融入环境。典型的黑色西装，对着对讲机讲话。看来，这些就是将监视我们一举一动、跟随我们四处走动的安保团队成员了。

I feel the anger flare up inside me as I try to resist the urge to go over and confront one of them. I feel like I should go over and tell them to leave us the hell along until we're out of this place. I should ask them if they really think something is going to happen but I know it'll achieve nothing. It'll just cause a scene and likely end up with us being asked to take the next flight back to Germany.  
我感到怒火中烧，试图克制自己不去找他们理论的冲动。我觉得应该过去告诉他们，在我们离开这个地方之前，别来烦我们。我应该问问他们是否真的认为会发生什么事，但我知道这不会有任何结果。只会引起一场闹剧，很可能最终导致我们被要求搭乘下一班飞机返回德国。

I nod, "Yes, they are."  
我点头，“是的，他们就是。”

"I hate this... I'm sorry." he whispers.  
"我讨厌这样... 对不起。" 他低声说道。

"Idiot, don't you dare be sorry." I snap back, "At least we're here."  
"傻瓜，你敢说对不起试试。" 我厉声回道，"至少我们在这儿。"

"I know but..." "我知道但是..."

"But nothing." I lean forward and kiss him on the lips, "Pretend they're not there. Focus on me, you can do that right?"  
"但没什么。" 我向前倾身，吻了他的唇，"假装它们不存在。专注于我，你能做到的，对吧？"

He nods, "I'll try but... it feels like they're everywhere."  
他点点头，"我会试试，但...感觉它们无处不在。"

"They are everywhere." I confirm, "But just focus on me, think about what I'm going to do to you when I get you in that hotel room, you can do that right?"  
"它们确实无处不在。" 我确认道，"但只需专注于我，想想我带你进酒店房间后要对你做的事，你能做到的，对吧？"

I watch in satisfaction as a blush comes to his cheeks and looks around, "I... Yes... very much so..."  
我满意地看着他脸颊泛起红晕，环顾四周，“我……是的……非常……”

"Good. You're safe with me, now... lets go."  
“很好。现在你和我在一起很安全……我们走吧。”

I take another look towards the doorway and allow myself one more deep breath. A strange thought enters my head for a moment as we start to slowly walk. At least this meeting won't be as embarrassing as the first time I met Shinji. We're indoors so no gusts of wind and I'm wearing jeans. So, definitely no repeat of that moment.  
"我又朝门口看了一眼，深吸一口气。当我们开始慢慢走动时，一个奇怪的念头在我脑海中闪过。至少这次见面不会像我第一次遇见真嗣时那么尴尬。我们在室内，没有风，我穿着牛仔裤。所以，肯定不会再发生那种事了。”

I can feel the eyes of the security teams on us as I take hold of Kaworu's hand and other hand takes hold of my luggage. I grit my teeth as we continue to walk towards the doorway, I'm sure behind us the teams are relaying that information and letting the next group know to get into position. So, this is how it's going to be on this holiday, security watching us at all times. Every meal we take, every museum we go into, every location... they'll be there. I won't even be able to use the bathroom without feeling like I'm being watched.  
当我握住渚薰的手，另一只手抓住行李时，我能感觉到安保团队注视着我们。我们继续向门口走去，我咬紧牙关，确信在我们身后，团队正在传递信息，让下一组人进入位置。看来这个假期就要这样度过了，安保人员随时监视着我们。每一顿饭，每一个博物馆，每一个地点……他们都会在那里。我甚至在上厕所时都会感觉被人盯着。

The doors slide open as we approach and I blink as the arrivals lounge appears before me. I look ahead and immediately spot them. It doesn't take me long, after all, there aren't that many people in the area with blue hair. I can also tell, from the way that Kaworu is suddenly squeezing my hand, that he has spotted them as well.  
当我们走近时，门滑开了，我眨了眨眼，到达大厅出现在眼前。我向前看去，立刻发现了他们。毕竟，在这个区域没有多少人有着蓝色头发。我还能从渚薰突然紧握我的手的方式中看出，他也已经发现了他们。

I ignore the pain as we continue to walk towards them. Rei seems to have spotted us as well, I can see her subtle smile from here. She nudges Shinji with her elbow and he turns to face us. As he does, I see his mouth open ever so slightly in shock. I can make out the nerves and emotion on his face as we get closer. Almost immediately, I feel a lump forming in the back of my throat. Swallow it down Asuka, not here, not now. Stay strong, you're not going to cry in a goddamn airport of all places.  
我无视疼痛，继续向他们走去。丽似乎也发现了我们，我在这里都能看到她那微妙的微笑。她用肘轻推真嗣，他转身面对我们。就在这时，我看到他震惊地微微张开了嘴。随着我们越来越近，我能看出他脸上的紧张和情感。几乎立刻，我感到喉咙后部形成了一个硬块。吞下去，明日香，不是在这里，不是现在。坚强点，你不会在机场这种地方哭出来的。

We continue to move towards them, around us I can hear the chatter of families reuniting, of businessmen meeting with their drivers and of tourists figuring out where to go. With each step the emotion builds inside of me, the lump growing bigger, the burning behind my eyes growing stronger and the feelings in my stomach.  
我们继续向他们走去，周围我能听到家庭团聚的闲聊声，商务人士与司机会面的声音，还有游客们商量着该去哪里。每走一步，我内心的情感就愈发强烈，喉咙里的硬块越来越大，眼后的灼热感越来越强，胃里的感觉也越来越复杂。

I don't even know why I'm feeling this way. I shouldn't be. I'm Asuka Langley... damnit, that's why I'm feeling this. I'm feeling this because of who I am, because of what I am and what I was. I'm feeling this because of how I arrived in this place the first time, what I learned and what I felt and did whilst I was here and how I left this place. I'm feeling this because of the years of built up frustration and emotion.  
我甚至不知道自己为何会有这种感觉。我不应该的。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷...该死，这就是原因。我会有这种感觉是因为我是谁，因为我是什么，我曾经是什么。我会有这种感觉是因为我第一次来到这里的方式，我在这里学到的、感受到的和做过的事情，以及我离开这里的方式。我会有这种感觉是因为多年来积累的挫折和情感。

For a moment the pain in my hand becomes too much, I turn to Kaworu, my teeth gritted, "Kaworu... my hand..."  
有那么一刻，手上的疼痛变得难以忍受，我转向薰，咬紧牙关，“薰...我的手...”

He slackens his grip instantly, "Sorry... I... sorry..."  
他立刻放松了握力，“对不起...我...对不起...”

We finally reach them, I stop barely a meter away as my vision becomes blurry from the tears forming in my eyes. I'm powerless to stop it from trickling down my cheek as my gaze wanders from Rei to Shinji. Just like the many groups of friends of families that are re-uniting here today, I too am unable to stop the wave of emotion. No matter how much that voice inside is willing me to not feel it, no matter how much I think it makes me look weak, I cannot stop it.  
我们终于走到了他们面前，我停下脚步，距离不到一米，泪水模糊了我的视线。我无力阻止它们从脸颊滑落，目光在丽和真嗣之间游移。就像今天在这里重逢的许多朋友和家庭一样，我也无法抑制这股情感的浪潮。无论内心那个声音如何劝我不要感受，无论我觉得这有多么显得软弱，我都无法停止。

I look to see Shinji smiling at his, his eyes have betrayed him aswel. At least he has tears running down both cheeks, I still win... in some way. I turn to see Kaworu in a similar way, as I expected... it's only Rei who is keeping it together, her smile widening.  
我望向真嗣，他正对着我微笑，但他的眼睛也出卖了他。至少他的双颊都有泪水滑落，在某种程度上，我还是赢了...我转向看向薰，正如我所料...只有丽保持着镇定，她的笑容愈发灿烂。

"A-Asuka..." Shinji finally starts to speak, his voice trembling and little more than a whisper, "Kaworu... I... Welcome home..."  
“A-明日香...”真嗣终于开口说话，他的声音颤抖着，几乎成了耳语，“薰...我...欢迎回家...”

I feel my hand release my luggage, I hear it fall to the ground. I take a step forward, positioning myself in front of him and stare into his eyes. I frown at him as I do so, I'm trying to look intimidating but it's hard to do so when I have tears flowing freely down my cheeks.  
我感到自己的手松开了行李，听着它坠落地面。我向前迈了一步，站在他面前，凝视着他的眼睛。我皱着眉头，试图显得威慑，但泪水肆意滑落脸颊，这实在难以做到。

What do I say? I was going to be cocky and confident. I was going to make a joke and make us all smile. I was going to pretend to be arrogant and say something like, 'What are you stupid, what's with that expression, aren't you glad to see us.'  
我该说什么呢？我本打算表现得傲慢自信。我本想开个玩笑，让我们都笑起来。我本想假装自大，说些类似‘你是不是傻，那表情怎么回事，见到我们不高兴吗？’的话。

Only... I can't do that. That moment, that speech, those words are just a conjuration, a moment that I have control of but I don't have control here. It's just my minds attempt to preserve a ridiculous image that has served me no good. This is... reality, and I am not that Asuka, I am the Asuka who has dreamed of this reunion for so very long.  
只是...我做不到。那一刻，那番话，那些词句，不过是幻想，一个我能掌控却在此刻无法掌控的瞬间。那只是我脑海中试图维持一个对我毫无益处的荒谬形象。这是...现实，而我已不再是那个明日香，我是那个长久以来梦想着这次重逢的明日香。

What was it he said? 'Welcome home'? I think about it for a moment. This country... was it ever really my home? I was here less than a year. I was raised in Germany and I always tried to identify as that but I... I've never really had a home, have I? Not one that I can remember. There was the time I spent with Mama but... I can barely remember that now.  
他当时说了什么？‘欢迎回家’？我思索片刻。这个国家……它真的曾是我的家吗？我在这里待了不到一年。我在德国长大，一直试图认同那里，但我……我从未真正拥有过一个家，对吧？至少我记不清了。和妈妈在一起的时光……但现在我几乎记不清了。

When I lived with Misato and Shinji... that felt like the only true home I ever had. I suppose... in a way I am home. I give another look towards Kaworu... he's like me too. Someone without a proper home. I suppose... this is his home too, where he for a brief moment first felt alive. I look back at Shinji.  
当我与美里和真嗣一起生活时……那感觉是我唯一真正的家。我想……在某种程度上，我确实回到了家。我又看了一眼渚薰……他也像我一样。一个没有真正家的人。我想……这也是他的家，他第一次短暂感受到生命的地方。我回头看向真嗣。

"W-We're home..." I whisper as we both move and embrace one another. I pull him towards me tightly feeling his warmth for the first time ever in my life. My hand cups the back of his head and I close my eyes as I feel more tears flow down my face.  
“我……我们回家了……”我低声说着，我们一同移动并拥抱彼此。我紧紧地把他拉向我，第一次感受到他身上的温暖。我的手托住他的后脑勺，闭上眼睛，泪水再次滑落我的脸颊。

We are home. 我们到家了。

### Chapter 23: Unsolid Ground  
第二十三章：不稳之地  

**2nd December – Tokyo 2 Hotel Restaurant – Kaworu Nagisa  
12 月 2 日 – 东京 2 号酒店餐厅 – 渚薰**

It has become quite the struggle for me to continue to keep my eyes open as I sit at the table and try to catch some part of the conversation going on around me. My mind struggles to comprehend a word, their words merging into one. The environment is a symphony of ambient noise that my brain has given up processing. I feel a strange disconnect from my own body, this vague feeling that I'm floating. It could be because of the wine or perhaps the jet lag, most likely it is a mixture of the two.  
我坐在桌前，努力保持眼睛睁开，试图捕捉周围对话的片段，这已成为一种相当艰难的挣扎。我的思维努力理解每一个字，但它们却融合成一片。环境中的背景噪音汇成一首交响乐，我的大脑已经放弃处理。我感到与自己的身体有一种奇怪的脱节，这种模糊的感觉让我觉得自己在漂浮。这可能是由于葡萄酒的作用，或是时差的影响，最有可能的是两者的混合。

I try to regain some focus and turn, as I tend to, when I need some focus towards Asuka. She does not seem to be having the same struggles that I'm having. She seems full of life and energy and she is oh so very beautiful right now. Sat next to her is Rei, the woman has said little to me all day beyond the initial greeting. Next to her is Misato Katsuragi, she has seemed friendly enough but much like Rei has said little to me and is shooting me the occasional glare every now and then.  
我试图重新集中注意力，就像往常一样，当我需要向明日香寻求一些专注时。她似乎并没有经历我这样的挣扎。她看起来充满生机和活力，此刻的她真是美极了。坐在她旁边的是绫波，这位女士一整天除了最初的问候外，几乎没有对我说什么。她旁边是葛城美里，她看起来足够友好，但和绫波一样，对我说话不多，偶尔还会向我投来一瞥。

I cannot help but feel like an outsider in this situation. Everyone has been friendly enough but I know I am not really wanted here. I know the interest from those at this table is on Asuka and her return to this country. I know these people are Asuka's friends and I am the stranger. I am just here, an uninteresting and jet-legged weird looking man, who also happens to be the one who nearly destroye dthe world many years ago.  
我不禁觉得自己在这个场合像个局外人。虽然每个人都足够友好，但我知道我并不真正受欢迎。我知道这张桌子旁的人对明日香回到这个国家很感兴趣。我知道这些人都是明日香的朋友，而我是个陌生人。我只是在这里，一个无趣且时差未倒、长相怪异的男子，同时也是多年前差点毁灭世界的那个人。

Completing the group is Shinji, he is sat next to me. He, very much like myself, has said little during the meal. He seems to be as awkward and shy as I remember him to be. I could smile and laugh about it, if it wasn't for me being so tired and feeling like I was to blame for the awkwardness. I wonder... if I wasn't here right now, would he be feeling this way?  
补全这个小团体的是真嗣，他坐在我旁边。他和我一样，在餐桌上几乎没怎么说话。他似乎和我记忆中一样尴尬和害羞。如果不是我这么疲惫，感觉自己要对这种尴尬负责，我本可以对此微笑和笑出声的。我在想……如果我现在不在这里，他会不会有这样的感觉？

"Are you feeling okay Kaworu?" I'm jolted from this sleepy meandering through my mind by the sound of his voice.  
“你感觉还好吗，薰？”他的声音将我从昏昏欲睡的思绪中惊醒。

I turn to him, my eyelids heavy and nod, "I am... fine, just tired."  
我转向他，眼皮沉重地点头，“我……还好，只是累了。”

"It's been a long day for you, hasn't it?" he asks me.  
"对你来说，今天真是漫长的一天，不是吗？" 他问我。

I nod back at him, "Yes, we flew overnight but I fear I did not sleep very well on the plane. I don't think I have slept properly for... over a day."  
我朝他点点头，"是的，我们连夜飞行，但恐怕我在飞机上没怎么睡好。我觉得我已经超过一天没有好好睡过了。

"Are you doing to be okay?"  
"你还好吗？"

"I will be." I smile at his concern for me, "I think I just need to get some sleep. I do not think the warmth in here is helping either."  
“我会没事的。” 我对他对我的关心微笑，“我想我只是需要睡一觉。这里的温暖似乎也没什么帮助。”

Our little conversation seems to have drawn the attention of the others at the table. I can feel Asuka placing her hand on my arm and squeezing gently. I look around to see Misato looking at Shinji, Rei seems to be more concerned with her glass of wine, "I think we're going to be here for a while, why don't you take Kaworu out for a walk around the area?"  
我们的小对话似乎引起了桌边其他人的注意。我能感觉到明日香把手放在我的手臂上，轻轻地捏了一下。我环顾四周，看到美里正看着真嗣，丽似乎更关心她的那杯红酒，“我想我们还要在这里待一会儿，你为什么不带渚薰出去在附近散散步呢？”

I feel my eyes widen ever so slightly in surprise at her suggestion. I didn't expect her to show any concern for me, never mind suggest that me and Shinji go out on our own. I look down at Asuka who merely nods, "Go ahead."  
我对她的提议感到有些惊讶，眼睛微微睁大了些。我没想到她会对我表示关心，更不用说建议我和真嗣单独出去了。我低头看向明日香，她只是点了点头，“去吧。”

I think about it for a moment, a walk outside would probably do me some good. It'd allow me to clear some of the cobwebs in my mind, it'd allow me to get out of this stuffy room and reduce the risk of me falling asleep at the table. I turn towards Shinji, "Is that... okay with you?"  
我思索片刻，出去走走或许对我有益。这能让我理清思绪，走出这闷热的房间，减少我在桌前打瞌睡的风险。我转向真嗣，问道：“这样……你介意吗？”

He nods at me, "Yeah... if it'll help."  
他朝我点点头，“嗯……如果能帮到你的话。”

I get to my feet carefully and almost immediately my attention is drawn to the few other people in the room who also stand up. My eyes wander to the entrance to the little restaurant and I see the man in the suit talking into something on his jacket. I lower my eyes and begin to sit down only for Asuka to take hold of my jacket sleeve, "Ignore them Kaworu."  
我小心翼翼地站起身，立刻注意到房间里其他几个也站起来的人。我的目光飘向小餐馆的入口，看到那个穿西装的男人正在对着他夹克上的什么东西说话。我垂下眼准备坐下，却被明日香抓住了夹克袖子，“别理他们，薰。”

"I can't they..." "我不能他们..."

Misato also looks around and witnesses the source of my discomfort, she turns back around to me, a frown on her face, "I told those idiots to not be in the room whlst I was here. I'm really sorry about this Kaworu. I'll make sure I speak to them in the morning, this isn't fair."  
美里也环顾四周，目睹了我不适的源头，她转回身来，皱着眉对我说：“我告诉过那些白痴不要在我在这里的时候进房间。真的很抱歉，卡罗。我保证明天会和他们谈，这不公平。”

"T-Thank you." I bow politely, again surprised at her words and concern. All I knew about Katsuragi had led me to believe she would not wish to be in the same room as me, never mind show me actual concern. Then again, perhaps I was being unfair towards her, I know she has had a difficult life and done a lot to help Shinji and Asuka where she can.  
"谢谢你。" 我礼貌地鞠了一躬，再次对她的言辞和关心感到惊讶。我所了解的葛城，让我以为她不会愿意和我同处一室，更不用说表现出真正的关心了。不过，也许我对她不公平，我知道她生活艰难，并且尽力帮助真嗣和明日香。

Shinji gets to his feet as well and we silently cross the room into the hotel lobby. I try to ignore the security communicating to others and moving into position to better follow me. Instead I focus solely on Shinji and moving out of the hotel into the cooler night air. A cold breeze hits my cheeks immediately and I take a brief moment to savor it as my body starts to wake itself up.  
真嗣也站起身来，我们默默穿过房间，走进酒店大堂。我试图忽略那些正在与其他人沟通并移动到更佳位置以便跟踪我的保安。相反，我全神贯注于真嗣，走出酒店，步入凉爽的夜风中。冷风立刻拂过我的脸颊，我短暂地享受着这一刻，身体开始苏醒。

"Is that better?" I hear Shinji ask.  
“感觉好些了吗？”我听到真嗣问道。

"Much better." I turn towards him and nod. We slowly begin to walk down the street, away from the hotel. As we do so I'm still quite aware of the man, positioned near the hotel entrance, now communicating with the rest of the team. I'm aware of the sniper in position on one of the rooftops opposite us.  
“好多了。”我转向他，点头示意。我们缓缓开始沿着街道前行，远离酒店。在此过程中，我依然清楚地意识到那位站在酒店入口附近的男人，他正在与团队其他成员沟通。我也察觉到对面屋顶上就位的狙击手。

I try to block it all out, this is no different to the security teams that look after me and Asuka back in Germany. Except those teams are there to protect us and not kill me in case I do something. Those teams also do a better job of staying out of sight.  
我试图屏蔽这一切，这与我们在德国时负责保护我和明日香的安全团队没什么不同。只不过那些团队是为了保护我们，而不是在我做出什么事情时杀了我。那些团队也更擅长保持隐蔽。

"It was... a bit much for me in there as well. I'm not great with crowds and too much noise either."  
“那里对我来说也有点太过分了。我不太擅长应对人群和太多噪音。”

I feel myself smile as we continue to walk down the street and around a corner. I'm feeling the cold a lot more now but it is still a lot better than being inside that restaurant. As we turn onto the next street, I see a number of stores with Christmas lights up. Opposite us a group of people, around our age are excitedly talking and taking pictures next to an inflatable Santa Claus.  
我们继续沿着街道走，转过一个拐角，我感到自己微笑起来。现在我更能感受到寒冷，但仍然比待在那家餐厅里好得多。当我们拐进下一条街时，我看到许多商店挂上了圣诞灯饰。对面有一群和我们年龄相仿的人，正兴奋地交谈着，并在一个充气圣诞老人旁边拍照。

"it is... certainly very different to the first time we met, isn't it?" I ask, "A lot colder too."  
"这真是...和第一次见面时大不一样了，对吧？" 我问道，"而且也冷多了。"

"Yeah..." Shinji trailed off for a moment leaving me to wonder if I have said the wrong thing. Perhaps bringing up any memory of that meeting was not appropriate. I wait a few more seconds before he continues to speak, "Misato... said that after Third Impact the world changed again. She said that somehow the seasons here started to go back to normal and the damage we had done to the planet, even prior to Second Impact had been repaired somehow."  
"是啊..." 真嗣顿了一下，让我不禁怀疑自己是不是说错了什么。或许提起那次见面的任何记忆都不合适。我等了几秒，他才继续说道，"美里...说在第三次冲击后，世界又变了。她说不知怎么的，这里的季节开始恢复正常，我们之前对地球造成的伤害，甚至在第二次冲击之前，都以某种方式修复了。"

"Humanity was... given a second chance. An opportunity to move forward and perhaps learn from its mistakes, to do better." I pause for a moment, "That is because of you Shinji."  
"人类得到了...第二次机会。一个向前迈进，或许从错误中学习，做得更好的机会。" 我顿了顿，"这都是因为你，真嗣。"

He stops and looks at me for a moment, merely shaking his head, "No... I didn't... I didn't ask for that... I didn't think to ask... I just..."  
他停下，看了我一会儿，只是摇摇头，“不……我没有……我没有要求那个……我没想过要问……我只是……”

Without thinking I place my hand on his shoulder, "It doesn't matter what you asked for or what you thought. What matters is that you did something, your actions enabled this second chance. If you had done nothing then... this wouldn't have happened."  
我不假思索地将手放在他的肩膀上，“你要求了什么或你当时怎么想的并不重要。重要的是你做了什么，你的行动促成了这次重来的机会。如果你什么都没做……这一切就不会发生。”

Shinji looks away for a moment down the street before turning back to face me, "Misato... Rei... Asuka... they all said the same thing."  
真嗣朝街道下方看了一会儿，然后转回身面对我，“美里……丽……明日香……她们都说了同样的话。”

"Then perhaps you should believe them." I remark as we resume walking down the street, "Our actions... have consequences beyond which we could imagine, regardless of intention. You on that day... you told Lilith what you wanted... Lilith granted your desire and gave humanity a gift, a gift that blessed even myself. Besides... when you think about it, it would have been quite a callous act for Lilith to have abandoned you in a dead world."  
"那么或许你应该相信他们。" 我们继续沿着街道走时，我评论道，"我们的行为……会产生超出我们想象之外的后果，无论意图如何。你在那一天……你告诉了莉莉丝你想要什么……莉莉丝实现了你的愿望，给了人类一份礼物，这份礼物甚至也惠及了我。此外……当你仔细思考时，莉莉丝在一个死寂的世界中抛弃你，这本就是一种相当无情的行为。"

I can see by look on his face that my words haven't really convinced him but he nods, "I suppose... in a way you are right. I just... people try to look at me as a hero and I don't really feel like it."  
从他的表情我能看出，我的话并没有真正说服他，但他点了点头，"我想……在某种程度上你是对的。我只是……人们试图把我看作英雄，而我并不真的觉得自己是。"

"Then don't... just be you." I remark.  
"那就不要……就做你自己。" 我评论道。"

We continue to walk through the various streets of the city. I'm not sure if Shinji has a particular destination in mind or if we are just wandering. Either way this feels nice, walking alongside him, talking or commenting on various things I see, if is nice. One of my fears was that seeing him again would be awkward, and I won't deny that it is, but there is something natural about this.  
我们继续穿梭于城市的各条街道。我不确定真嗣是否有特定的目的地，或者我们只是在漫无目的地游荡。无论如何，这种感觉很美好，与他并肩而行，谈论或评论我所见到的各种事物，真的很不错。我曾担心再次见到他会很尴尬，我并不否认这一点，但这种相处有一种自然的氛围。

We cross another road and come upon a large plaze, there are a few groups of people nearby. Some of them quite excited and taking photos on their phones. I look up and see why, in the middle of the plaze is a large Christmas tree. Decorated in bright gold and silver lights. At the top is a large star, and scattered at the bottom is replicas of giant presents.  
我们穿过另一条马路，来到一个宽阔的广场，附近有几群人。其中一些人显得相当兴奋，正用手机拍照。我抬头一看，明白了原因，广场中央矗立着一棵巨大的圣诞树。装饰着明亮的金色和银色灯光。树顶是一颗巨大的星星，树下散落着巨型礼物的复制品。

"It is quite beautiful, isn't it?" I comment as we both stop and look up at it.  
“真的很美，不是吗？”我评论道，我们俩都停下脚步，抬头仰望着它。

I turn to see Shinji, he's looking up at the top of the tree, his face serious, "Kaworu I..."  
我转身看到真嗣，他正抬头望着树顶，神情严肃，“薰，我……”

He trails off, causing me to prompt him, "Hm?"  
他话音未落，我便催促道，“嗯？”

"About those things I told you... I... I'm sorry..." he shakes his head, "I... thank you for forgiving me... I..."  
“关于我告诉你的那些事……我……我很抱歉……”他摇了摇头，“我……谢谢你原谅我……我……”

"Shinji..." I cut him off and place my hand on his arm, "Please... don't apologize for this now. We have already spoken about this and... it is done. Besides... I am a little bit too jet lagged to process such things right now. Let's just... enjoy this night, if you do wish to talk about this then we always have tomorrow."  
"真嗣..." 我打断他，把手放在他的手臂上，"请...现在不要为此道歉。我们已经谈过这件事了，而且...已经结束了。再说...我现在有点时差反应，处理不了这些事。我们就...享受今晚吧，如果你想谈这件事，我们明天随时可以谈。""

"Y-Yeah... You're right... I'm sorry."  
"嗯...你说得对...对不起。""

"It's okay." I answer him, "For what it's worth I am also grateful to you for your forgiveness. It does mean a lot to me to be able to come here... to spend time with you and your family... and with Asuka. I feel... for the first time in my life like I'm somewhere I belong."  
"没关系。" 我回答他，"不管怎样，我也感激你的原谅。能来到这里...和你还有你的家人，以及和明日香在一起...对我来说意义重大。我感觉...这是我一生中第一次，觉得自己属于某个地方。""

We fall into a comfortable silence as we look up at the top of the tree once again. I turn and see him smiling and I do the same. For a brief moment my mind flashes to another world. One where my life took a different path all those years ago. Where would I be now had that have happened? If I had been able to resist that call? Where would Shinji be? Asuka? Me?  
我们再次抬头望向树顶，陷入了舒适的沉默。我转头看见他微笑，便也跟着笑了。那一刻，我的思绪闪回到另一个世界，那个多年前我的人生走上不同道路的地方。如果那一切真的发生了，我现在会在哪里？如果我能抵抗那个召唤，真嗣、明日香、我，又会如何？

My mind continues to wander, some of the fears I had before coming here are now coming to the forefront. My tired brain unable to combat them. I go back to my thoughts that I will end up being left alone. Maybe I should leave, so that I can allow Asuka and Shinji to fulfil their destiny.  
我的思绪继续游走，来这里之前的一些恐惧现在浮现出来，我疲惫的大脑无法与之抗衡。我又回到了那个想法，最终我会被独自留下。也许我应该离开，这样明日香和真嗣才能实现他们的命运。

A more selfish thought enters my mind. One that I quickly exorcise. My love for this man next to me, for Shinji is real. I can feel it, my heart is beating quickly, my eyes keep glancing at him. I keep wanting to smile when he looks at me. I feel that warm feeling in my stomach and it isn't from the wine. I feel for Shinji just as I feel for Asuka. In another world... I could be with Shinji. That is not this world though and I would not wish to be apart from Asuka.  
一个更自私的想法闯入我的脑海，我迅速将其驱散。我对身边这个男人，对真嗣的爱是真实的。我能感受到，我的心跳加速，我的目光不断瞥向他。每当他看向我时，我都想微笑。我感到胃里那种温暖的感觉，并非来自酒。我对真嗣的感觉，就像我对明日香的感觉一样。在另一个世界...我可能和真嗣在一起。但那不是这个世界，我也不希望与明日香分开。

Besides... I am sure Shinji does not have those feelings for me. I know his heart yearns for Asuka.  
再说了...我相信真嗣对我没有那种感觉。我知道他的心渴望着明日香。

"Kaworu..." Shinji saying my name suddenly snaps me from my thoughts, "Can we... get a photo together..."  
"薰..." 真嗣突然叫我的名字，打断了我的思绪，"我们...能一起拍张照片吗..."

I look across at him, he's got his phone clutched in his hand and looking up at the tree, I nod, "Yeah... I'd like that."  
我转头看向他，他手里紧握着手机，抬头望着树，我点点头，"嗯...我很愿意。"

We move into position with our backs to the tree. I put my arm around him and he does the same. With his free hand he holds the phone away from us and angles it so as to get the two of us in along with a good portion of the tree. I move my head a little bit closer to his, and we both smile as his finger hits the capture button.  
我们背靠大树站好。我伸手揽住他，他也同样回抱。他用空着的那只手将手机举远，调整角度以便将我们俩和大树的一部分都拍进去。我稍稍把头靠向他，当他的手指按下快门时，我们相视而笑。

"Wait... I want to get one with my phone as well." I announce as Shinji puts his phone away. We get into position again as I take my phone out. This time I find myself holding him a bit tighter, my hand gripping his side firmly, hugging him closer to me. I can feel his warmth on mine, I can smell the aftershave he is wearing. I can feel my face glowing redder as I smile and take the photo.  
“等等……我也想用我的手机拍一张。” 我宣布道，同时真嗣收起了他的手机。我们再次摆好姿势，我拿出自己的手机。这次我发现自己搂得更紧了，手紧紧抓着他的侧腰，将他拥得更近。我能感受到他的体温，闻到他身上的须后水味。我笑着拍下照片，脸颊越发红润。

We take the photo and let go, our eyes meeting for a brief moment. I see his cheeks are glowing red as well and I wonder... no... it doesn't matter.  
我们拍完照片，松开了彼此，目光短暂交汇。我看到他的脸颊也泛着红晕，我心想……不……这并不重要。

"We... should probably go back now." He says as I finish putting my phone away.  
"我们...现在应该回去了。" 他说着，我刚把手机收好。

"Yes... we should... They will likely be done now. Thank you, Shinji."  
"是的...我们该回去了...他们现在可能已经结束了。谢谢你，真嗣。"

**3rd December – Museum Café - Asuka Langley Soryu  
12 月 3 日 – 博物馆咖啡馆 - 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I sigh with some annoyance as we take our seats in the centre of the little café and wait for our food to be brought over. Directly opposite us I can see two members of the security team watching us carefully. I can sense the other two directly behind us at the doors and I'm fairly certain I saw another one sat at a table.  
我带着几分恼怒叹了口气，我们坐在小咖啡馆的中央，等待食物被端上来。正对面，我可以看到两名安保人员正小心翼翼地盯着我们。我能感觉到另外两名就在我们身后的门口，而且我相当确定我看到还有一个人坐在一张桌子旁。

I've been here for barely a day and I've already had enough of them. I know we had been told to expect heightened security but this is ridiculous and not to mention highly obvious to anyone who might be watching. I just have it in the back of my mind that someone will figure it out. Some journalist or conspiracy nut will see the sharp increase of men in black around the city and make a big deal out of it.  
我才来这里不到一天，就已经受够了他们。我知道我们被告知要预料到加强的安保措施，但这太荒谬了，更不用说对任何可能正在观察的人来说都极其明显。我心里总有个念头，觉得会有人发现。某个记者或阴谋论者会注意到城市里黑衣男子的急剧增加，并对此大做文章。

Goddamn escorts, checking in and out of security checkpoints and having to eat with them watching. I'm sick of it. It wouldn't shock me if I saw one of them in disguise when I went to the bathroom at this point.  
该死的保镖，进出安全检查站，还得在他们监视下吃饭。我真是受够了。如果我现在去洗手间时看到其中一个伪装的家伙，我也不会感到惊讶。

"I am sorry, I know their presence is annoying..."  
"我很抱歉，我知道他们的存在很烦人..."

I look up sharply at Kaworu, "Stop that. It isn't your fault. They said the presence would be increased but they didn't say it'd be like this. This is overkill."  
我猛地抬头看向渚薰，"别这样。这不是你的错。他们说存在感会增强，但没说会变成这样。这太过分了。"

Kaworu nods, "I do feel it is a bit... much. Didn't Miss Katsuragi say she was going to speak to someone about it?"  
渚薰点头，"我也觉得有点...过头了。葛城小姐不是说她会找人谈谈这件事吗？"

I nod back at him, "Yeah, she messaged me this morning to say that she had let them know it was a bit much. Whether anything will come of it I don't know. It's all Tokita's doing, so I imagine he'll want to make us feel as uncomfortable as possible."  
我朝他点点头，“是啊，她今早给我发消息说已经告诉他们这有点过分了。至于会有什么结果，我也不清楚。这都是托基塔搞的鬼，我想他会尽可能让我们感到不舒服。”

"Tokita... he was the one most opposed to me coming here, wasn't he?"  
“托基塔……他是最反对我来这里的，对吧？”

"Yup." I frown remembering my encounter with that man, "He put in place the security for this trip as well. I had kinda hoped it wouldn't be this bad, Shinji and Misato went to see him a month and a half ago. Shinji made it sound like he wasn't quite as bad as we thought but... I guess that still bad enough to have this happen."  
“没错。”我皱眉回想起与那个男人的相遇，“这次旅行的安保措施也是他安排的。我本以为情况不会这么糟，真治和美里一个半月前去见过他。真治说得好像他没我们想的那么糟糕，但……看来还是糟糕到会发生这种事。”

"I think it is to intimidate me." Kaworu answers, "To ensure that I definitely don't do anything."  
"我认为这是为了恐吓我。" 渚薰回答，"确保我绝对不会做出任何事情。"

"That's stupid!" I exclaim, "In a musuem as well! What are they expecting you to do here? Hijack a dinosaur skeleton?"  
"这太荒谬了！" 我惊呼，"还是在博物馆里！他们指望你在这里做什么？劫持一副恐龙骨架吗？"

Kaworu laughs at my question, "It would not surprise me. I think despite what I have told them, their idea of that I was capable of is somewhat exaggerated."  
渚薰对我的问题笑了笑，"这并不会让我惊讶。我想尽管我已经告诉了他们，但他们对我的能力的想象还是有些夸大了。"

"You know... You never did tell me, what exactly is it you could do?" I ask him, not quite sure if this is an appropriate place to ask or if I should be asking at all. At the same time, I know so very little of what happened that day. I guess maybe I should learn something.  
"你知道吗...你从未告诉我，你究竟能做什么？" 我问他，不太确定这是否是合适的提问场合，或者我是否应该问。与此同时，我对那天发生的事情知之甚少。我想也许我应该了解一些。

Kaworu takes a moment to think about his answer, "Nothing that I miss now... but like the rest of my brethren I could manifest an A.T. Field."  
渚薰思考了一会儿他的回答，"现在没有什么我做不到的...但像我的其他同胞一样，我可以显现出 A.T.力场。"

"I guess that much, was there anything else? You know, could you shoot lasers or float?" I ask with a grin, imagining the ridiculous image of Kaworu floating through the air shooting lasers out of his eyes and hands.  
"我想这一点已经知道了，还有别的吗？比如，你能发射激光或者漂浮吗？" 我笑着问，想象着渚薰在空中漂浮，从眼睛和手中射出激光的荒谬画面。

He smiles as well, "Nothing like that... Well, I was able to levitate. My main thing, because I was created from Adam both body and soul is it allowed me to command beings constructed from Adam."  
他也微笑着回应，“并非那样……嗯，我能够悬浮。我的主要能力，因为我由亚当的身体和灵魂所创造，使我能够指挥由亚当构成的生物。”

I take a look at him and recall what I've been told about that time, "You mean, like my Unit 02?"  
我打量着他，回想起那时被告知的事情，“你是说，像我的二号机那样？”

He nods and his gazes wanders towards the floor, "Yes... Like your Unit 02. It was not complete control of such things, I was not able to command Unit 00 as an example, the soul within had to be dormant or hiding away. In any case I am... truly sorry about that."  
他点头，目光飘向地面，“是的……像你的二号机。但那并非完全的控制，例如我无法指挥零号机，因为其中的灵魂必须处于沉睡或隐藏状态。无论如何，我……对此深感抱歉。”

"Don't be." I reassure him and reach over the table to stroke his cheek with my hand and bring his gaze back towards me, "It's funny though... Kaworu... the big scary Angel, that could command machines of so much power and that was virtually indestructible can now... well now you can barely put on a pair of pants without falling over yourself."  
"别担心。" 我安慰他，伸手越过桌子，用手抚摸他的脸颊，将他的目光引回我身上，"不过说起来挺有趣的... 渚薰... 那个曾经能操控强大机器、几乎无法摧毁的大天使，现在却... 现在连穿条裤子都能把自己绊倒。"

He laughs as a waitress brings over two bowls of soup with bread. He immediately tears off a bit of the bread and dips it into his soup, "I admit, now that I am completely human, I do have occasional issues with balance. There is no part of me that would want to give this up though. The abilities I had, being able to see people's feelings, feeling that power... I would not wish for it again. Now... my life is fuller, I no longer feel the emptiness I used to."  
他笑着，服务员端来了两碗汤和面包。他立刻撕下一块面包，蘸进汤里，"我承认，现在我完全是个普通人，偶尔确实会失去平衡。但我绝不想放弃现在的生活。那些能力，能看透人心的感觉，那种力量... 我再也不想拥有了。现在... 我的生活更加充实，不再感到曾经的空虚。"

He pauses, "it is true that I spent a lot of my time being scared... feeling guilty of what I have done but I would not go back to what I had before. More of my life now is spent being happy, feeling genuine love for others and this world. This life now... it is what I want. I want to be with you Asuka... I love you."  
他停顿了一下，"确实，我曾花了大量时间感到害怕... 对自己所做的事感到内疚，但我绝不想回到过去。现在，我的生活更多地充满了快乐，真正地爱着他人和这个世界。现在的生活... 正是我想要的。我想和你在一起，明日香... 我爱你。"

I feel a redness come to my cheeks as he continues to speak. My eyes wander down to my own bowl of soup as I stir it around with my spoon, "Idiot... I was just going to make another joke about you being clumsy and then you have to go and say that."  
他继续说话时，我感到脸颊泛红。我的目光游移到自己的汤碗上，用勺子搅拌着，心想：“笨蛋……我正打算再开个你笨手笨脚的玩笑，结果你却说了那番话。”

"It is the truth." He continues, "It is true that there are disadvantages to my life now. I am certainly more fragile than I used to be both physically and emotionally but that fragility makes me feel much more alive than I ever was, and it is that fragility that makes me appreciate what I have even more."  
“这是事实。”他继续说道，“现在我的生活确实有诸多不便。无论是身体上还是情感上，我都比以前脆弱得多，但正是这种脆弱让我比以往任何时候都更感生机勃勃，也正是这种脆弱让我更加珍惜我所拥有的一切。”

"Stop it." I laugh in embarrassment as I break off some bread of my own. We fall into a comfortable silence as we eat our meal. For a brief moment there is only the two of us, the rest of the world, the other diners, the security, it all fades away. The insecurities, the doubts and fears I have, gone. Just blissful moments as we eat and look across at one another.  
“别说了。”我尴尬地笑着，掰下一块面包。我们陷入了一种舒适的沉默，享用着餐点。有那么一瞬间，仿佛只有我们两人，世界其他的一切，周围的食客，安保人员，都消失了。我的不安全感、疑虑和恐惧也都不见了。只有我们共进晚餐、彼此对视的幸福时刻。

It's a moment ruined by my phone suddenly going off. The other diners look unimpressed by the sudden loud proclamation that Phil Collins can feel it coming in the air tonight, the security near us look over as if Kaworu is about to suddenly spring into action like some sleeper agent triggered by the sounds of a drum fill.  
就在这时，我的手机突然响起，破坏了这一刻的宁静。其他用餐者对这突如其来的大声宣告——菲尔·柯林斯能感受到今夜空气中即将到来的气息——显得不以为然。附近的安全人员则朝我们这边望来，仿佛渚薰随时会像被鼓点触发潜伏特工一样突然行动起来。

It's MIsato, of course it's Misato, that woman always knew how to ruin a moment, "Hello?"  
当然是美里，除了她还能有谁，那个女人总是知道如何破坏气氛，“喂？”

_"Hey Asuka! I didn't catch you at a bad time, did I?"_ Her tone is teasing and sleazy, as if she expecting to catch me and Kaworu at it during the middle of the day. Despite the fact that she knows our schedules and exactly where we'll be right now.  
“嘿，明日香！我没打扰到你吧？”她的语气带着戏谑和狡黠，仿佛期待着在白天抓到我和渚薰正在做什么。尽管她明明知道我们的日程安排和此时此刻的确切位置。

Still, it is MIsato, I should have expected this. She already decided last night, whilst Kaworu and Shinji were taking their walk, to get in a few digs about me and Kaworu. In one way I hate it, I don't really enjoy discussing my love or sex life, as fantastic as it is, with others or being teased about it for that fact. At the same time, I appreciated the jokes. I feel like Misato saying those things were her way of saying she approved of it and accepted him.  
尽管如此，毕竟是美里，我早该料到的。昨晚，在渚薰和真嗣散步时，她就已经决定要趁机调侃我和渚薰几句。一方面我讨厌这样，我并不喜欢与他人讨论我的爱情或性生活，即便它再美妙，也不愿因此被取笑。但另一方面，我又感激这些玩笑。我觉得美里说这些话，是在以她的方式表达对这段关系的认可和接受。

"Pervert!" I snap back, "You know exactly where we are right now! And what is it you're doing right now? Probably stumbling out of bed with a hangover I imagine!"  
“变态！”我回呛道，“你明明知道我们现在在哪里！你现在又在做什么？估计是宿醉未醒，跌跌撞撞地从床上爬起来吧！”

Despite the harsh words there is a smile on my face as I say them, perhaps once, a long time ago, there would have been real malice in what I had said. I cringe at the thought now but I know I always used to give Misato a hard time over her drinking habits, perhaps deservedly so in some cases but even when she did try I still persisted in doing that.  
尽管这些话说得尖锐，但我脸上却带着微笑，或许很久以前，我曾真的心怀恶意。现在想起这些，我不禁皱眉，但我知道自己过去总是对美里的饮酒习惯不依不饶，有些情况下或许她确实该被指责，但即便她有所改进，我依然不依不饶。

This time there is no malice, only friendly joking. It is slightly strange to hear those words come out of my mouth though. I hadn't seen or heard from her in so long I thought things would be awkward between us. There was no awkwardness though, it was nice... It was normal.  
这次没有恶意，只有友好的玩笑。不过，听到这些话从我嘴里说出来，还是有点奇怪。我已经很久没有见过她，也没有听到她的消息了，我以为我们之间会有些尴尬。但并没有，感觉很好...一切都很正常。

_"I'll have you know I gave up hangovers many years ago!"_ She answers me, _"Not the drinking, just the hangovers! Anyway, I won't keep you on the phone for long, I wanted to update you on the security detail you both have."_  
“我得告诉你，我很多年前就戒掉了宿醉！”她回答我，“不是戒酒，只是宿醉！不管怎样，我不会在电话里占用你太多时间，我想更新一下你们俩的安全细节。”

I look around the room and see several members of the aforementioned security, "Oh... them..."  
我环顾房间，看到了几个上述安全团队的成员，“哦...他们啊...”

_"Yes... then. I made a few phone calls today for the two of you. Tried to case in a couple of favours I'm owed."  
"是的...那么。今天我为你们俩打了几个电话。试着动用了一些我应得的恩惠。"_

"And?" "然后呢？"

She lets out a sigh, _"Well the bad news is that you are still going to have to deal with it on that scale for another two days at most. The guy in charge of the teams and who put it all together won't budge unless he is given word from his superior... and his superior happens to be..."_  
她叹了口气，"那么坏消息是，你们最多还得再应付两天这种规模的麻烦。负责团队并组织这一切的家伙不会让步，除非他的上级发话...而他的上级恰好是..."

"Tokita?" I finish Misato's sentence for her.  
"Tokita？" 我帮 Misato 完成了这句话。

_"Exactly. Tokita and this guy worked to draw up the plans for the security detail some time ago and he has the final say on it all."_ Misato answers me, _"So... I contacted him directly. This is where the good news comes in."_  
"没错。Tokita 和这家伙之前一起制定了安保计划的草案，他对此有最终决定权。" Misato 回答我，"所以...我直接联系了他。好消息来了。"

"Go on?" "继续说？"

_"Well I explained how I felt it was a bit too much and that I'd observed Kaworu and fully believe him to not be any threat."_ Misato starts to explain, _"Tokita has agreed to slacken the detail on the two of you in another two days if he is sufficiently convinced that Kaworu isn't a threat. He has maintained that a few things will have to remain, appropriate sign offs and escorts but you won't see as many people around and should be a bit more comfortable. It's not perfect but it's the best I could do."_  
"嗯，我解释了我觉得这有点过头，并且我已经观察过渚，完全相信他不会构成任何威胁。" 美里开始解释，"如果托基塔充分相信渚不是威胁，他同意在两天后减少对你们两人的监视。他坚持说有些事情必须保持，适当的签字和护送，但你们不会看到那么多人在周围，应该会更自在一些。虽然不完美，但这是我所能做到的最好结果。"

"No... It's..." I begin my reply, "It's great Misato, even reducing them a little bit is better than nothing at all. Thank you."  
"不... 这是..." 我开始回答，"这已经很好了，美里，即使减少一点也比什么都没有强。谢谢你。"

_"Don't worry about it, just enjoy your time here."_ She answers cheerily, _"Oh, Rei is going to message you later with the details of the restaurant for tonight. I was also wondering if you'd been in touch with Hikari at all?"_  
"别担心，好好享受这里的时间吧。" 她愉快地回答，"哦，绫波稍后会给你发今晚餐厅的详细信息。我还想知道你有没有和光联系过？"

I shake my head, "No... No not yet, I... I'll do it later. We want to get used to things here first."  
我摇摇头，“不……不，还没，我……我晚点再做。我们想先习惯这里的环境。”

_"I understand but make sure you do. She's been dying to hear from you. Anyway, I should go, enjoy your day, see you later Asuka."  
“我明白，但确保你会去做。她一直渴望听到你的消息。不管怎样，我该走了，祝你今天愉快，再见，明日香。”_

"Okay, bye Misato and... thank you."  
“好的，再见，美里，还有……谢谢你。”

I hang up the phone and slip it back into my jacket pocket before looking up to see Kaworu looking at me with a nervous expression on his face, "Good news?"  
我挂断电话，将它塞回夹克口袋，抬头看到渚正紧张地看着我，“好消息？”

I nod, "Seems so, Misato said that we'll have to ride out this wave of constant surveillance for another couple of days but... after that we'll start to see less of them and it might be more like what we have to deal with in Germany."  
我点头，“看来是的，美里说我们还得再忍受这波持续监视几天，但...之后我们就会少见到他们，可能就像在德国时那样。”

Kaworu smiles, "You mean she... was actually able to do that?"  
渚微笑道，“你是说，她...真的能做到那样？”

I nod again, "Yup... We'll still have to have an escort and sign in and out of places but it'll be better than this. Unfortunately, that thing you wanted me to do will have to wait I suppose but I'm sure you can live without that."  
我再次点头，“是的...我们仍然需要有陪同并签入签出地点，但会比现在好。不幸的是，你让我做的那件事恐怕得等等了，但我相信你没它也能过。”

I grin as I see the blush come to Kaworu's cheeks when he realizes just what I'm talking about, "Um... I... Was not being completely serious about that I mean... it would be nice and... the risk would but... I... Um... I..."  
我咧嘴一笑，看到 Kaworu 的脸颊因意识到我在说什么而泛起红晕，“嗯...我...那会儿不是完全认真的，我是说...那样会很不错而且...风险也会...但我...嗯...我...”

I let out a laugh, "Well... maybe when we get home and if you're very good I can..."  
我笑出声来，“好吧...也许回家后，如果你表现很好，我可以...”

He blushes even more, "I... You are serious?"  
他的脸更红了，“我……你是认真的吗？”

I nod, "You know me... I don't joke about things like that."  
我点点头，“你知道我的……我不拿这种事开玩笑。”

"Yes... Well... I... in any case..." I watch as he fidgets in his seat and grin knowing the reasons why. I should feel bad for getting such a 'rise' out of him in public but I'm sure it'll be gone by the time we're finished. He continues to speak, "I am very thankful to Misato for doing that. I was... concerned that she would... hate me."  
“是的……嗯……我……无论如何……”我看着他在座位上局促不安，心知肚明原因，不禁咧嘴一笑。在公共场合让他如此‘激动’，我本该感到内疚，但我确信这情绪在我们结束前就会消失。他继续说道，“我非常感激美里这样做。我曾……担心她会……恨我。”

I reach over the table and take both of his hands into my own, "I know... but she doesn't hate you. She has her doubts, but she knows deep down you're not a threat. She has me, Shinji and Rei vouching for you and that is good enough for her."  
我越过桌子，握住他的双手，“我知道……但她并不恨你。她有些疑虑，但内心深处明白你并非威胁。有我、真嗣和绫波为你担保，这对她来说已经足够了。”

"Thank you." He nods, "How was it for you yesterday... seeing them again, are you okay?"  
“谢谢你。”他点头，“昨天再次见到他们，你感觉如何……还好吗？”

I let go of his hands as I pick up my spoon and stir my soup for a moment, "It was... weird. In some ways it felt like I hadn't been away at all but there was little of the negative feeling I had when I lived her before. I just... I felt like I could be me around them. I don't know if it was the jet lag or whatever but... it was nice. I'm looking forward to seeing them again."  
我松开他的手，拿起勺子搅动着汤，“那感觉……挺奇怪的。在某些方面，仿佛我从未离开过，但之前住在这里时的负面情绪几乎消失了。我只是……觉得在他们面前可以做回自己。不知道是时差还是别的什么原因，但……感觉很好。我期待着再次见到他们。”

"Me too..." he answers, "It was... really nice."  
"我也是..." 他回答，"那真是... 非常美好。"

**4th December – Hotel Function Room – Kaworu Nagisa  
12 月 4 日 – 酒店多功能厅 – 渚薰**

"SURPRISE!" "惊喜！"

I get the fright of my life at the sound of the sudden exclamation and the lights in the room suddenly being switched on. For a moment I stand there, my eyes wide open my mouth slightly ajar at the scene before me.  
突如其来的惊呼声和房间灯光骤然亮起，让我吓得魂飞魄散。我愣在原地，双眼圆睁，嘴巴微张，眼前的景象让我一时语塞。

I finally turn my head slightly to see Asuka in a very similar state. Her face now pale, her mouth wide open and mouthing expletives repeatedly. I turn my head once more, the scene starting to make some sense. Before us is a group of people, all of them I recognize but some of them I haven't met as of yet.  
我终于稍稍转头，看到明日香也处于相似的状态。她的脸色苍白，嘴巴大张，不停地无声咒骂。我再次转头，眼前的景象开始变得有些合理。我们面前是一群人，我认得他们中的大多数，但也有一些我尚未谋面。

Behind the group is a table laden with food, its center piece is a large chocolate cake with a number of candles placed in it. Hanging above the table is a banner displaying the words 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY ASUKA!' I can't stop the grin spreading to my face as I turn once more to see Asuka still in a state of shock.  
人群后方是一张摆满食物的桌子，中央是一个插着许多蜡烛的大巧克力蛋糕。悬挂在桌子上方的横幅上写着‘明日香生日快乐！’我忍不住咧嘴笑了起来，再次转头看向明日香，她仍处于震惊之中。

My eyes wander to the group again, Shinji and Rei are stood closest to us in the middle of the group. They are smiling the most and I suspect them to be the ones behind this. Next to them is their guardian Misato and just to the side of Misato is a woman that takes me a little bit of time to identify as Ritsuko Akagi.  
我的目光再次游移到那群人身上，真嗣和丽站在人群中央，离我们最近。他们笑得最开心，我怀疑这一切都是他们策划的。他们旁边是他们的监护人美里，而美里旁边那位女士，我花了一点时间才认出是赤木律子。

Ritsuko looks slightly different to how I remember, her hair a little bit shorter and also returned to its natural brown, rather than the bright blonde I recognize from her pictures. When I was within NERV I never got the opportunity to meet Ritsuko, the woman next to her is the one I met. Maya Ibuki. Maya is holding Ritsuko's hand, I think Asuka did mention something about the two of them being a couple now.  
律子看起来和我记忆中的有些不同，她的头发稍短，也恢复了自然的棕色，而不是我认识的照片中的亮金色。在 NERV 期间，我从未有机会见到律子，我见到的其实是她旁边的这位女士——伊吹玛雅。玛雅正握着律子的手，我想明日香确实提到过她们俩现在是一对。

On the opposite side are four people, three of them I recognize but again, I did not meet and the fourth is Kodama, the girl that helped me so much when I returned and who I now know is Rei's girlfriend. The two guys are, I am assuming, Shinji's friends Touji and Kensuke and the other girl must be Asuka's old friend Hikari.  
对面有四个人，其中三个我认得但从未见过面，第四个是帮我很多忙的儿玉，我现在知道她是丽的恋人。那两个男生，我猜是真嗣的朋友东治和健介，另一个女孩想必是明日香的老朋友光。

I feel Asukas hand tighten around my own as I turn to face her once more. She still looks shocked but she has stopped mouthing expletives. I continue to smile at her as I try to not let my own feelings of anxiety take over. This is an unexpected situation for us both, naturally I am scared but I need to remind myself that I am safe here, this is a secure place for me. This would have been organized for Asuka and both Rei and Shinji would not want to cause anyone any upset or see any harm come to us.  
当我再次转身面对她时，我感觉到明日香的手紧紧握住了我的手。她看起来仍然很震惊，但已经停止了咒骂。我继续对她微笑，试图不让自己的焦虑情绪占据上风。这种情况对我们俩来说都是意料之外的，我自然感到害怕，但我需要提醒自己，我在这里是安全的，这是一个对我来说安全的地方。这一定是为明日香安排的，绫波和真嗣都不会希望任何人感到不安或看到我们受到伤害。

Still... as I look around the room, I do sense some slight unease at my presence. Especially from the friends of Shinji and Asuka. I can only imagine what they know about me and what they think of me.  
尽管如此...当我环顾房间时，我确实感觉到我的存在引起了一些轻微的不安。尤其是真嗣和明日香的朋友们。我只能想象他们对我了解多少，以及他们对我的看法。

"Did... did you know about this?" Asuka finally speaks, her voice hushed to that only I can hear it.  
“你...你知道这件事吗？”明日香终于开口了，她的声音低到只有我能听见。

I shake my head and continue to smile, "No... I did not."  
我摇了摇头，继续微笑着，“不……我没有。”

"I'm going to kill the both of them." She answers, a smile coming to her face, I can see the tears welling up in her eyes, "Going to this effort... all for me... Why?"  
“我要把他们俩都杀了。”她回答道，脸上露出了笑容，我可以看到她眼中涌动的泪水，“费这么大劲……全是为了我……为什么？”

"Because they love you." I reply, it's the simplest answer and it's true.  
“因为他们爱你。”我回答，这是最简单的答案，也是真的。

"Why? I don't... deserve..."  
"为什么？我不……配不上……"

Asuka stops herself mid-sentence and starts to shake her head as I squeeze her hand in comfort. Before I get a chance to say anything further and provide more comfort both Shinji and Rei move towards us. Both of them are still smiling and as they get closer, I loosen my grip on Asuka's hand to let her move towards them both and wrap them in a hug.  
明日香话说到一半就停住了，开始摇头，我握紧她的手以示安慰。还没等我再说些什么给予更多安慰，真嗣和绫波已经向我们走来。他们俩依然面带微笑，随着他们靠近，我松开了握着明日香的手，让她走向他们，拥抱在一起。

"I hope you like what we have done." Rei says as they break the hug.  
"希望你们喜欢我们的安排。" 绫波在拥抱结束后说道。

"Idiots..." I hear Asuka choke out as I approach, "You know I don't like a fuss being made of me..."  
"傻瓜..." 我走近时听到明日香哽咽地说，"你们知道我不喜欢大张旗鼓的..."

I laugh a little bit at hearing Asuka trying to sound angry at the pair of them but fail completely. She brings up her hand to wipe away a tear with her sleeve. I look around the room again and can't help but feel slightly inept. Shinji and Rei clearly went to a lot of effort to plan and organize this. They made a cake, put out food, set up the room and invited Asuka's friends here.  
听到明日香试图对那两人发火却完全失败，我不禁轻笑出声。她抬起手用袖子擦去眼泪。我再次环顾房间，不禁感到有些无措。真嗣和绫波显然费了不少心思来策划和组织这一切。他们做了蛋糕，摆出了食物，布置了房间，还邀请了明日香的朋友们来。

Why didn't I think of doing something like this? I should have been involved in the process or even suggested it. Instead... I just did what was expected. I went with the basics, I got the flowers delivered to her room, I got her a package or new games she wanted, I tracked down the vinyl records she had been after I...  
为什么我就没想到做这样的事呢？我本该参与这个过程，甚至提出建议的。然而...我只是做了预期中的事。我按部就班，送花到她房间，买了她想要的新游戏，还找到了她一直想要的黑胶唱片...

I feel a very sharp pain in my arm from where Asuka has just punched me, a lot harder than normal. I turn my head to see her glaring at me, "Stop it!"  
我感到手臂上一阵剧痛，那是被明日香刚刚狠狠揍了一拳，比平时都要重。我转过头，看到她正怒视着我，"别这样！"

"Stop what?" I ask as I rub my tender arm.  
"别什么？" 我一边揉着疼痛的手臂一边问。

"Thinking those things that you're thinking. My presents off of you were wonderful and I what you did was beyond what I expected! You didn't know this was being planned either!" She turns her stare to Rei, "This was you... wasn't it?"  
"别想那些你在想的事情。我送给你的礼物非常棒，你做的已经超出了我的预期！你也不知道这个计划，对吧！" 她转向丽，"这是你...干的吧？"

Rei nods and smiles back at us, "Yes. Until last night only Shinji was aware of what was happening. I had to let him in on it because I fear my skills with cooking are not as good as his. I did not want to inform the others until the last minute lest they ruin the surprise for you. That did include Kaworu as well."  
丽点点头，向我们微笑，“是的。直到昨晚，只有真嗣知道发生了什么。我必须让他参与进来，因为我担心我的烹饪技术不如他。我不想在最后一刻之前告诉其他人，以免他们破坏给你准备的惊喜。这也包括了薰。”

"I wouldn't have ruined it!" I exclaim, somewhat offended but not shocked by Rei's bluntness.  
“我不会破坏它的！”我有些受伤地喊道，尽管对丽的直率并不感到惊讶。

"Perhaps, perhaps not. Regardless I did not want to take that risk." Rei replies calmly, "Also, given what I have been told in regards to your garment-based clumsiness whilst nervous, I thought informing you would have increased to risk of injury to yourself of Asuka."  
“也许会，也许不会。无论如何，我不想冒这个险。”丽平静地回答，“而且，鉴于我听说的你在紧张时基于衣物的笨拙，我认为告诉你可能会增加你和明日香受伤的风险。”

Before I can reply to that, Shinji chimes in to quickly change the subject, "If it helps, she didn't even tell Misato about it until this morning."  
在我来得及回应之前，真嗣插话进来迅速转移了话题，“如果这能有所帮助的话，她甚至到今早才告诉美里。”

"I suppose..." I concede, not really sure if knowing that does make me feel any better.  
“我想……”我让步道，其实并不确定知道这一点是否真的让我感觉好些。

"He isn't that bad... he's doesn't always fall over now!" Asuka makes a half-hearted attempt to defend me through her laughter as she takes my hand and looks around the room. I feel myself tense up as I realize most of the, if not all, the eyes in the room are now on me. I take a few deep breaths as Asuka leans in, "Don't worry about it, we'll just greet everyone and introduce you. No one is going to say or do anything."  
“他没那么糟糕……他现在不总是摔倒了！”明日香一边笑着，一边半心半意地试图为我辩护，她握住我的手，环视房间。我感到自己紧张起来，意识到房间里的大多数，如果不是全部，目光现在都集中在我身上。我深呼吸几次，明日香靠过来，“别担心，我们只是和大家打个招呼，介绍你一下。没人会说什么或做什么的。”

I'm not given a chance to reply before Misato steps forward and pulls Asuka away from me and into a tight hug, "Happy Birthday Asuka!"  
我还没来得及回答，美里就走上前来，把明日香从我身边拉开，紧紧地抱住她，“生日快乐，明日香！”

Asuka looks up at her, "Thank you Misato, I... I really appreciate all of this."  
明日香抬头看着她，“谢谢你，美里，我……我真的非常感激这一切。”

"It was all Rei and Shinji's doing, they sorted out everything!"  
“这都是绫波和真嗣的功劳，他们把一切都安排好了！”

Misato releases her grip on Asuka and then turns to me, "Are you okay Kaworu?"  
美里松开了对明日香的手，然后转向我，“你还好吗，薰？”

I nod, "I am... good, thank you."  
我点头，“我很好，谢谢。”

"Good." The woman smiles and nods, "Look, don't be nervous, they've all been warned beforehand and as you can see, no security in here. So just... be yourself."  
“很好。”她微笑着点头，“听着，别紧张，他们事先都得到警告了，而且如你所见，这里没有保安。所以就...做你自己吧。”

"I will... try." I nod back, "Thank you."  
"我会...试试看。" 我点头回应，"谢谢你。"

Asuka now leads me towards the first two people, Ritsuko and her wife Maya. Ritsuko seems quite friendly and polite when greeting me. Maya on the other hand gives me quite an icy glare. I suppose I can't blame her, she was on the bridge when I did... what I had to do. She probably remembers that day quite clearly.  
明日香现在领着我走向前两个人，律子和她的妻子真希波。律子在向我打招呼时显得相当友好和礼貌。而真希波则给了我一个相当冰冷的瞪视。我想我不能怪她，她当时在舰桥上，目睹了我...所做的一切。她可能对那一天记忆犹新。

I mumble something of a hello and say I hope they're both well before Asuka moves us on to the next two people. The next two are Touji and Kensuke, Shinji's longtime friends. I've heard a little bit about the two of them from Asuka. Most of it has been her joking about them both being idiots and not worthy of her attention. It's always been in jest though, although their position as friends of both Shinji and Asuka for a number of years does make me wary.  
我咕哝着说了声你好，并希望她们都安好，然后明日香带着我们走向下两个人。接下来是冬二和剑介，真嗣的老朋友。我从明日香那里听说过一些关于他们的事情。大部分都是她开玩笑说他们俩都是笨蛋，不值得她关注。不过这总是开玩笑的，尽管他们作为真嗣和明日香多年的朋友，确实让我有些警惕。

Touji is the first one I notice and I suppose the one I'm most wary of. He's taller than us, muscular and athletically built. He's made an attempt to dress smartly but I can see from how disheveled the suit is and how untidy his facial hair and hair in general is it isn't something he is used to.  
我第一个注意到的是东治，我想也是我最提防的一个。他比我们高，肌肉发达，体格健壮。他试图打扮得体面些，但我从他那凌乱的西装、不修边幅的胡须和整体不整洁的头发可以看出，这不是他习惯的样子。

The reason I'm wary of Touji is purely because I know the details of his first encounter with Shinji. I know the guy can be somewhat hotheaded, it was in the reports I had read and Shinji himself had told me. I'm not quite sure what to expect here, should I expect him to punch me in the face for what I had done?  
我对东治保持警惕的原因纯粹是因为我知道他和真嗣第一次相遇的细节。我知道这家伙有时会冲动，这是我在报告里读到的，也是真嗣亲口告诉我的。我不太确定这里会发生什么，我该预料他会因为我所做的事而揍我一拳吗？

I know it seems illogical, despite knowing of that hotheadedness I also know Touji is a caring person deep down. Shinji also spoke of the way Touji defended him against classmates who tried to talk down to Shinji about being a pilot. He spoke of the way Touji looked after his sister and also of the way Touji forgave him after the Bardiel incident.  
我知道这似乎不合逻辑，尽管知道他的冲动，我也知道东治内心是个有爱心的人。真嗣还提到东治如何保护他免受试图贬低他作为驾驶员的同学的欺负。他谈到东治如何照顾他的妹妹，以及在巴迪尔事件后如何原谅他。

Thankfully my fears are unfounded as I get a firm handshake from the guy and he welcomes me to Japan. He invites me to go with the three of them for a drink during my stay here. I politely nod and say that if I find the time to do so I will.  
幸好我的担忧是多余的，这家伙给了我一个坚定的握手，并欢迎我来到日本。他邀请我在这期间和他们三人一起去喝一杯。我礼貌地点头，表示如果有时间的话我会去的。

I now turn my attention towards the smaller one, Kensuke. Kensuke has longer hair, some patchy facial hair and round rimmed glasses. He is looking me up and down as if he is examining some sort of alien creature. I suppose in a way he is doing exactly that, so I try to not be too weirded out by it. Asuka told me that Kensuke was the 'Otaku' of their group, during their time in school he was heavily into military things and the Eva's in general.  
现在我把注意力转向了较小的那个， Kensuke。 Kensuke 留着长发，有些稀疏的胡须和圆框眼镜。他上下打量着我，仿佛在审视某种外星生物。我想在某种程度上，他确实是在这么做，所以我尽量不对此感到太奇怪。 Asuka 告诉我， Kensuke 是他们中的 '御宅族'，在学生时代，他非常热衷于军事事物和 EVA 机体。

Asuka told me that he was the more annoying of the two, if anything because of all the questions and his constant need to express a desire to be a pilot. She said he was quite naïve and never really made an effort to understand what her, Shinji and Rei may have been going through. She was also quite annoyed that his reaction to Touji's selection as a pilot was not one of fear for the boy or to congratulate him but instead jealousy.  
Asuka 告诉我，他是两人中更烦人的那个，主要是因为他总是问个不停，而且一直渴望成为驾驶员。她说他相当天真，从未真正努力去理解 Asuka、Shinji 和 Rei 可能经历的事情。她还很生气，因为他对 Touji 被选为驾驶员的反应不是为这个男孩感到害怕或祝贺，而是嫉妒。

She also made some rather alarming comments regarding Kensuke's usage of his camera during the first couple of weeks of her living in Tokyo-3. It was my understanding that he did stop such activities after being rightly threatened by her and Hikari.  
她还对健介在最初几周使用相机的行为发表了一些相当令人震惊的评论。据我所知，在她和光正确的威胁下，他确实停止了这些活动。

When I first met Shinji, I had learned a little bit about Kensuke from him. Kensuke was the smarter of the three, and buried beneath that surface was a loyal friend. He certainly didn't want anyone to suffer but he never really understood what was at stake. Both have warned me that if anyone is going to ask me any awkward questions, then it would be him.  
当我第一次见到真嗣时，我从他那里了解了一些关于健介的事情。健介是三人中比较聪明的一个，而且在那表面之下，是一个忠诚的朋友。他当然不希望任何人受苦，但他从未真正理解其中的利害关系。他们俩都警告过我，如果有人会问我一些尴尬的问题，那一定是他。

"Hmm... You don't seem to be much different to us." I hear him comment and my stomach drops. I can't say I wasn't expecting it but I was hopeful that maybe it wouldn't happen.  
“嗯……你看起来和我们没什么不同。”我听到他评论道，胃里一阵翻腾。我不能说我没预料到，但我曾希望也许这不会发生。

I am also quite shocked when I see Touji promptly jab Kensuke in the arm and snarl at him, "Kensuke, not now!"  
当我看到东治迅速地戳了一下剑介的胳膊，并对他咆哮道，“剑介，现在不行！”时，我也感到相当震惊。

I smile at the two of them, "I am not that different to you, not anymore."  
我对他们俩微笑着说，“我已经不再那么与众不同了。”

"So, what was it lik... Ow!"  
“那么，那是什么感觉...哎哟！”

Kensuke's questioning is promptly cut off by another punch to the arm from Touji. Touji looks at me with something of a sheepish expression, "Sorry about this Kaworu, he can't help himself."  
健介的质问被东治又一记打在手臂上的拳头迅速打断。东治带着些许尴尬的表情看着我，“抱歉啊，卡洛，他控制不住自己。”

I nod, "I... understand. I know that the two of you will have many questions for me and about me."  
我点点头，“我……理解。我知道你们俩会有很多问题要问我，关于我。”

Touji shakes his head, "Not really, I don't really care what you used to be. People do dumb things, I know I have. As far as I'm concerned, if Shinji says you're okay then you're okay with me."  
东治摇摇头，“其实不然，我并不在乎你过去是什么样。人都会做蠢事，我自己也有过。就我而言，如果真嗣说你没问题，那我就相信你没问题。”

I'm quite taken aback by his words, if only because they do not seem to be representative of the person Asuka has told me about. I smile, "Thank you... I appreciate that."  
他的话让我颇为惊讶，只因这与明日香所描述的那个人似乎不太相符。我微笑着回应：“谢谢你……我很感激。”

I'm given little opportunity to say anything else before Asuka pulls me away from the two of them, shaking her head and cursing Kensuke as she does so. She leads me towards the final two people in the room. Hikari and her sister Kodama.  
我还没来得及再说些什么，明日香就拉着我离开了他们俩，一边摇头一边咒骂着真希波。她带着我走向房间里的最后两个人，光和她的妹妹小玉。

"I told you they were both idiots." Asuka mutters as we talk across the room.  
“我就说他们俩都是傻瓜。”明日香在我们穿过房间时低声说道。

I laugh, "They weren't too bad... They were a little bit different to what I expected but they seem like good people."  
我笑着说：“他们其实还不错……虽然和我预想的有一点点不同，但看起来都是好人。”

"Oh yeah, they're definitely good people... but they're still idiots!"  
“哦，没错，他们绝对是好人……但还是笨蛋！”

I'm still laughing as we approach HIkari but soon stop when I see the expressions on both of their faces. Asuka lets go of my hand and I step aside to give the two of them a moment. I can see the nerves written on her face and realize just what a big moment this must be for her. These two haven't seen each other properly since before Third Impact. Asuka told me how Hikari was there for her during her breakdown.  
我们走向光时，我还在笑，但很快因为看到他们两人的表情而停了下来。明日香松开了我的手，我退到一旁给他们俩一点空间。我能看到她脸上的紧张，意识到这对她来说是多么重要的时刻。这两个人自从第三次冲击前就再也没有好好见过面。明日香告诉我，光在她崩溃时一直陪在她身边。

I look on as Hikari breaks down crying and rushes forward wrapping Asuka up into a tight embrace. Realizing that this is their moment, I step aside and make my way over to Kodama who acknowledges me with a polite nod, "Mr Nagisa, you are looking well. How have things been in Germany?"  
我看着光崩溃哭泣，冲上前去紧紧抱住明日香。意识到这是她们的瞬间，我退到一旁，走向儿玉，他礼貌地点头致意，“渚先生，您看起来气色不错。在德国过得如何？”

"Things have been good." I start to answer, "They have been... challenging at times though. I have had so much to learn, new skills that I did not have nor did I ever think I would need. Cooking... cleaning... paying bills... using public transport and dealing with other people but it has been a positive experience."  
“一切都很好。”我开始回答，“虽然有时颇具挑战。我学到了很多新技能，那些我以前没有也不曾认为自己会需要的技能。烹饪...打扫...支付账单...使用公共交通和与人打交道，但这是一段积极的经历。”

She grins at me, "I'm glad to hear it! I was really worried about you when you left us. It's a scary world out there at the best of times but... in your situation. I knew you could handle it though."  
她朝我咧嘴一笑，“很高兴听你这么说！你离开我们时，我真的非常担心。即便在最好的时代，外面的世界也充满惊险，何况你的处境。不过我知道你能应付得来。”

"I've been quite fortunate in the support I've been given." I admit, "Fuyutsuki has been a patient and valuable mental to me, you gave me a good start and Asuka has been... well meeting her has been the best thing to happen to me."  
"我得到了相当多的支持，这让我很幸运。" 我承认道，"冬月一直是我耐心且宝贵的精神支柱，你给了我一个良好的开端，而遇见明日香...可以说是我遇到的最美好的事情。"

"Sounds like things are going great then!"  
"听起来一切都很顺利啊！"

"They are..." I nod, "You know... all of this... I couldn't have done it without your support at the start. You helped me so much... you helped me be a little bit less afraid of who I was. You taught me the basics I needed to know of this world. I... don't know how I can repay you for that."  
"确实如此..." 我点头道，"你知道...这一切...如果没有你最初的扶持，我无法做到。你帮了我很多...你让我对自己少了一些恐惧。你教会了我这个世界的必要基础。我...不知道该如何回报你这份恩情。"

"Repay me by continuing to live and continuing to be happy. That is the only reward I desire from my work." She answers, "So... did you like my gift?"  
"以继续生活和保持快乐来回报我。这是我从我的工作中唯一渴望的回报。" 她回答道，"那么...你喜欢我的礼物吗？"

"The music?" I smile widely as I answer, "Yes, very much so. It was... a wonderful gift."  
"音乐吗？" 我笑着回答，"是的，非常喜欢。那是一个...美妙的礼物。"

"I had hoped so! I know you... loved music but wanted to experience more of what the world offered so it was... "  
"我曾希望如此！我知道你...热爱音乐，但想要体验更多世界的馈赠，所以它就... "

"Kaworu, may I speak with you?" We are suddenly interruped by Rei appearing next to the two of us. She turned towards Kodama, "I am sorry, this will not take long."  
"渚薰，我可以和你谈谈吗？" 我们突然被丽打断，她出现在我们两人旁边。她转向儿玉，"对不起，不会占用太久时间的。"

"It's fine." Kodama says, "It was nice to see you again Kaworu, we can talk later."  
"没关系。" 儿玉说，"很高兴再次见到你，渚薰，我们晚点再聊。"

"Yes, I'd like that." "好的，我很期待。"

I wait a moment as Rei kisses Kodama softly on the lips and tells her she'll also see her later. Rei gives her another apology before starting to lead me out of the room and through the hotel lobby to the outside. As the cold breeze hits my face, I begin to feel that familiar feeling of apprehension, I wonder exactly why Rei has brought me out here.  
我等了一会儿，看着丽轻轻地吻了小玉的唇，告诉她稍后也会见到她。丽再次向她道歉，然后开始带我走出房间，穿过酒店大堂来到外面。当冷风拂面而来时，我开始感受到那种熟悉的忧虑感，不知道丽究竟为什么要带我到这里来。

"Do not be afraid." She speaks, almost as if she was reading my mind, "It is just better that this conversation between us happens away from the others. I hope you are well?"  
“不要害怕。”她开口说道，仿佛能读懂我的心思，“只是我们之间的这场对话，最好远离其他人。希望你一切都好？”

"I am, thank you." “我很好，谢谢。”

"And you are enjoying your stay in Japan so far, despite the security." She also asks me.  
"尽管有安保措施，你在日本过得还愉快吧？" 她也问我。

"Yes, I am." "是的，我很享受。"

"Good." We stop and she turns to face me, a stern expression on her face, "Again, I apologize for bringing you out in this manner. There are two things I wanted to speak to you about. The first, is that I owe you an apology for my unfair treatment of you over the past few months."  
"那就好。" 我们停下脚步，她转向我，脸上带着严肃的表情，"再次，我为以这种方式带你出来道歉。有两件事我想和你谈谈。第一件事，是我要为过去几个月对你不公平的对待向你道歉。"

"Rei, you don't have to apologize for anything."  
"丽，你不需要为任何事道歉。"

"No. I do." She cuts me off, "When I heard of your return all I could do was worry that you would once again hurt the people I loved. I was unwilling to accept you as a part of their lives. I was unwilling to accept you as a potential friend to Shinji or a lover to Asuka. I could not see you as anything but that which you were back then, despite the fact that neither of us are what were. I could only see you as a villain and not a victim in all of this as well. I could not face the fact that we are in many ways, the same. What you tried to do... was very close to what I very nearly did."  
"不，我必须道歉。"" 她打断我，""当你回来时，我满脑子都是担心你会再次伤害我所爱的人。我不愿意接受你成为他们生活的一部分。我不愿意接受你可能是真嗣的朋友或明日香的爱人。我无法看到你除了过去的你之外的任何形象，尽管我们都不再是曾经的自己。我只能把你视为一个反派，而不是一个受害者。我无法面对我们其实在很多方面都很相似的事实。你试图做的事情... 和我差点做的非常接近。"

I nod my head, listening to what she has said, "Rei, you don't need to explain anything. I know why you thought those things and... I do not know if I would do any better in that regard. I don't blame you for how you reacted. I know that... I had and have to do a lot of work to gain peoples trust and prove to them that I am not what they think I am."  
"我点点头，听着她的话，""丽，你不需要解释什么。我知道你为什么那么想，而且... 我不知道在那方面我是否能做得更好。我不怪你的反应。我知道... 我必须做很多努力来赢得人们的信任，向他们证明我不是他们想象中的那样。"

"You have already done enough to prove that." She replies, "I have never seen Asuka as happy as she is now. The love that you two share... is so powerful. I no longer fear you hurting her, instead I am thankful that you came into her life."  
"你已经做得足够证明这一点了。" 她回答道，"我从没见过明日香像现在这样快乐。你们俩之间的爱...如此强烈。我不再担心你会伤害她，反而感激你走进了她的生活。"

I feel my cheeks turning red, "Rei... I..."  
我感觉脸颊发烫，"绫波... 我..."

"I just ask that..." Rei fixes me with a frightening and cold stare, "you never... ever hurt her."  
"我只求..." 绫波用一种令人畏惧且冰冷的目光盯着我，"你永远...永远不要伤害她。"

"I wouldn't! Rei... I love her, I can't imagine being without her, I can't imagine ever hurting her!"  
"我不会的！丽...我爱她，无法想象没有她的生活，无法想象伤害她！"

"Good." She remarks sternly before softening her stance somewhat, "I am happy you feel that way and care so much for her. I would also like to ask... how do you feel regarding my brother?"  
"很好。"" 她严肃地评论，随后语气稍缓，""我很高兴你有这样的感觉，并且如此关心她。我还想问...你对我的哥哥感觉如何？"

Her question catches me slightly off guard, not so much her asking it but the way she asked it and the way she is now looking at me. I can't help but wonder just what she means by asking it and how I should answer it. Should I be honest with her, and tell her about the love I also feel for Shinji or should I downplay that? Is this perhaps a test to prove to her that I would not abandon Asuka.  
她的问题让我有些措手不及，不是因为她问了，而是她问的方式和她现在看我的眼神。我不禁想知道她问这个问题的真正含义，以及我该如何回答。我应该对她诚实，告诉她我对真嗣的爱，还是应该淡化这一点？这或许是一个考验，证明我不会抛弃明日香。

I look back at her, "I care for your brother deep. I am... truly sorry for hurting him all those years ago and I am grateful to him that I have been given an opportunity to forge a new friendship with him."  
我回头看她，“我对你的弟弟情深意重。我……真的为多年前伤害了他而感到抱歉，也很感激他给了我一个机会，让我能与他建立新的友谊。”

"My brother loves you, you are aware of that, aren't you?" She replies bluntly.  
“我弟弟爱你，你明白这一点，对吧？”她直截了当地回答。

Again, she has completely caught me off guard and I feel a tingle down my spine and weird feeling in the pit of my stomach. Shinji... his feelings for me, I never really thought about that possibility. To hear any semblance of confirmation... but it does not matter how he feels.  
她再次让我措手不及，我感到脊背一阵发麻，胃里也涌起一种奇怪的感觉。真嗣……他对我的感情，我从未真正考虑过这种可能性。听到任何形式的确认……但他的感受并不重要。

"I did not know that but... my heart is with Asuka. It is true that I once had feelings for Shinji... in many ways I still do but I would not betray Asuka to act out on them. I love Asuka... so much..."  
"我之前并不知情，但...我的心属于明日香。确实，我曾经对真嗣有过感情...在很多方面我依然如此，但我不会因此背叛明日香去付诸行动。我爱明日香...非常爱..."

I trail off wonder if this really was a test and also wondering if Rei was telling me the truth. I look into her eyes for any trace of a lie. I do not think Rei would be the sort to deceive another especially with a subject such as this. Which leads me to ask, why is she telling me this?  
我话音渐弱，疑惑这是否真的是一场考验，同时也想知道绫波是否在说实话。我凝视着她的眼睛，寻找任何说谎的痕迹。我不认为绫波会是那种欺骗他人的人，尤其是在这种话题上。这让我不禁要问，她为什么要告诉我这些？

"...besides what he feels for me is surely an illusion based on what he thinks or thought I was. I know truthfully his heart is with... Asuka."  
"...再者，他对我的感情想必是基于他以为或曾经以为的我。我清楚地知道，他的心其实属于...明日香。"

Rei nods her head, "You are incorrect, his heart... is with you both."  
丽点了点头，“你说错了，他的心……属于你们俩。”

I shake my head as I see her smile slightly, all this Is doing is leading me to be more confused. Why is Rei telling me this? To hear that though, it makes me think about my own heart and feelings, have I not just thought a similar thing regarding myself, that I have these strong feelings for both of these people.  
我摇了摇头，看着她微微一笑，这一切只是让我更加困惑。丽为什么要告诉我这些？然而听到这些，我不禁思考起自己的心和感情，我难道不是刚刚也想过类似的事情吗，我对这两个人都有着强烈的感情。

"Asuka..." I start to speak, "She... feels strongly for him as well. I can see it when she talks about him. Her eyes light up, she wears a smile that is so very beautiful and so very frightening to me. It's a confirmation of her love for him."  
“明日香……”我开始说话，“她……对他也有着强烈的感情。我看得出来，当她谈论他时，她的眼睛会亮起来，她露出的笑容既美丽又让我感到害怕。这是她对他爱的确认。”

"And... that is what I see when I speak to her about you." Rei answers me, "It is quite interesting to me, to be a person who is learning to be human to witness such a thing. To witness this unique bond that the three of you share, to understand a truth that you have all been unable to admit to but all know deep down."  
"而...这就是我和她谈起你时看到的情景。" 丽回答我，"作为一个正在学习如何成为人类的人，见证这样的事情对我来说相当有趣。见证你们三人之间这种独特的纽带，理解你们一直无法承认但内心深处都明白的真相。"

I look at her again, "What are you trying to say?"  
我又看向她，"你想说什么？"

"Are you stupid?" Rei answers me, in a tone that tells me that Asuka may have been something of an influence on her, "You know what I am telling you, that it is time for the three of you to stop this and take your opportunity."  
"你傻吗？" 丽用一种让我觉得她可能受到了明日香某种影响的语气回答我，"你知道我在告诉你什么，是时候让你们三个停止这一切，抓住你们的机会了。"

"Why are you telling me this, why not Shinji or Asuka?"  
“为什么告诉我这些，而不是真嗣或明日香？”

"Because you are like me... you are a soul that was lost and is trying to find its way in the world. You are like me, you deserve to be happy and you are also like me. You are not originally of this world, you are no more bound to human conventions and traditions than I am. We may try to adapt to them but they are not ingrained upon us like they are to Asuka and Shinji. Therefore you... would be more understanding of such things."  
“因为你和我一样...你是一个迷失的灵魂，正试图在这个世界上找到自己的路。你和我一样，你值得幸福，你也和我一样。你原本不属于这个世界，你对人类的习俗和传统并不像我一样束缚。我们或许会尝试适应它们，但它们并不像对明日香和真嗣那样根深蒂固。因此，你会更能理解这些事情。”

I nod, "I... think I understand."  
我点点头，“我...我想我明白了。”

"I want my brother to be happy Kaworu... I want my best friend to be happy as well and you... you deserve to be happy too. Your time here in Japan is limited, I do not know what will happen after you return, it could be some time before you are all in this situation again, I would not want for you to waste this opportunity."  
"我希望我的哥哥能幸福，Kaworu...我也希望我最好的朋友能幸福，而你...你也值得拥有幸福。你在日本的时光有限，我不知道你回去后会发生什么，可能要过很久我们才能再次处于这样的境地，我不想让你错过这个机会。"

"Opportunity?" I repeat and think about what she is saying. I think about myself... about Asuka and about Shinji. About the love the three of us have for one another. I love Asuka and... I do think I love Shinji. Asuka... she loves me and I know she loves Shinji as well and Shinji... I was always uncertain of his feelings for me but I know he loves Asuka.  
"机会？"" 我重复着，思考她的话。我想到了自己...想到了明日香和真嗣。想到了我们三人之间的爱。我爱明日香，而且...我也确实爱着真嗣。明日香...她爱我，我也知道她爱真嗣，而真嗣...我对他对我的感情一直不确定，但我知道他爱明日香。

Would such a thing be possible though? Throughout human history there have been examples of it I suppose. It is not exactly seen as normal but then... there is little normal about me as it is. Would Asuka and Shinji accept such a thing though?  
然而，这样的事情可能吗？纵观人类历史，虽然有一些例子，但这并不被视为常态。不过...我本身就不太正常。但明日香和真嗣会接受这样的事吗？

"I do not... would they accept it?" I ask Rei.  
"我不确定...他们会接受吗？" 我问丽。

Rei nods, "I believe they would. Love is a strong thing even if it isn't traditional."  
丽点点头，"我相信他们会接受的。爱是一种强大的力量，即使它不是传统的。"

"But... I don't really... me and Asuka we just... sort of fell into it. It wasn't like I romanced her or she me, it just sort of... happened."  
"但是...我真的不太...我和明日香我们只是...自然而然地陷入了。并不是我追求她或者她追求我，只是自然而然地...发生了。"

"Then let this 'happen'" Rei replies, "Just make the most of this opportunity Nagisa."  
“那就让这‘发生’吧。”丽回答道，“好好利用这个机会，渚。”

**Hotel Exterior – Asuka Langley Soryu  
酒店外观 —— 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

The sun is now starting to set as I look out from my position on the rooftops over the skyline of Tokyo-2. I was able to escape from the party a few minutes ago, it was starting to get a little bit overwhelming for me. It's quite funny, my younger self would have loved all that fuss and attention, they'd have loved the cake and the presents. They'd have taken great joy in making sure everyone knew it was all about them.  
太阳开始西沉，我从东京-2 的天际线屋顶上俯瞰着这一切。几分钟前，我设法逃离了派对，那里开始让我感到有些难以承受。真有趣，年轻时的我肯定会喜欢所有的热闹和关注，他们会喜欢蛋糕和礼物。他们会非常享受确保每个人都知道这一切都是为了他们。

Now... Well it's not that I don't appreciate the fuss and the cake was beautiful and the gifts were lovely but I'm happier to just be able to slip by and be invisible. I'm happy to just take a few minutes to relax and be all by myself.  
现在...倒不是我不领情，热闹和蛋糕都很美，礼物也很可爱，但我更愿意悄悄溜走，不被注意。我只想独自一人，花几分钟时间放松一下。

It is nice to see everyone again though. Even Touji and Kensuke... I suppose for all the grief I gave them, they aren't too bad. I mean they are idiots and Kensuke does look ridiculous with that attempt at a moustache but they're loyal friends to Shinji and have looked after him. They've been a better friend than I could ever have hoped to be.  
不过，能再次见到大家还是挺好的。即便是冬二和剑介...尽管我给他们添了不少麻烦，他们也不算太糟。我是说，他们确实有点傻，剑介那小胡子也挺滑稽的，但他们对真嗣很忠诚，照顾他。他们比我原本希望的还要好的朋友。

I have to admit, it was quite amusing to me when Kensuke started to talk about his excited that Mari Makinami's next book is due out soon. He's apparently ordered himself a signed copy and would love to meet the person behind it. Maybe I'll tell him... maybe I won't but it was funny to share a knowing look with both Shinji and Kaworu about the whole thing.  
我得承认，当剑介开始谈论他对玛丽·真希波下一本书即将出版的兴奋之情时，我觉得挺有趣的。他显然已经订购了一本签名版，并希望能见到作者本人。也许我会告诉他...也许不会，但和真嗣还有薰交换了一个心照不宣的眼神，这件事还挺好笑的。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

So much for being alone. I turn around to see Shinji standing a few meters away from me. Thankfully, there is no one else there, so I suspect someone noticed I was missing and sent him after me, either that or he noticed me slip away.  
本以为能独自一人。我转过身，看到真嗣站在几米外。幸好没有其他人，我猜是有人注意到我不在了，派他来找我，要么就是他注意到我溜走了。

"Misato said she saw you slip away... she sent me to..."  
“美里说她看到你溜走了……她让我来……”

"See if I was okay?" I nod, "I'm okay, just not used to a situation like this. It's been a while."  
“看看我是否还好？”我点头，“我没事，只是不太习惯这种场合。已经很久没这样了。”

"I know what you mean." He laughs, "Not that... I was every really used to this sort of thing."  
"我明白你的意思。" 他笑着说，"并不是说……我以前真的习惯这种事情。"

"No... You weren't." I laugh as well as I turn back around to look out over the city again. Shinji quietly takes up a position beside me, "It's strange isn't it. The last time we'd have done something like this the buildings would probably have been moving up and down."  
"没错……你不习惯。" 我也笑着转过身，再次望向城市的远方。真嗣静静地站在我旁边，"真奇怪，不是吗？上次我们做这种事的时候，建筑物可能还在上下移动呢。"

I can see him nodding his head out of the corner of my eye, "Yeah... Tokyo 3 was... strange and beautiful in its own way."  
我瞥见他点头，"是啊……第三新东京市……有它独特的美，既奇怪又美丽。"

"Yeah... it was." I nod in reply, "It wasn't that bad a place to live I guess... well aside from the daily threat of giant monsters but I think... we did alright in defending the city, didn't we?"  
"是啊...确实。" 我点头回应，"那地方住起来还不算太糟...除了每天都有巨型怪兽的威胁之外，我想...我们保卫城市做得还不错，对吧？"

I see him turn his head, "Do you... miss that at all? Being a pilot, I mean?"  
我看到他转过头来，"你...怀念那些吗？我是说，当驾驶员的日子？"

"No... Not at all." I let out a sigh and turn myself around to face him, "Do you miss it?"  
"不...一点也不。" 我叹了口气，转过身面对他，"你怀念吗？"

"No. I didn't even like it when I was a pilot. I hated it. I hated wearing the plugsuit, I hated being in the cockpit, I hated fighting in it... I hated how much it hurt." Every word Shinji says mirrors my exact thoughts on the whole thing as well. For all I acted like I loved it, for all my training and words and for all I was damn good at it... I hated each and every moment of it.  
“不，我甚至在做飞行员的时候就不喜欢它。我讨厌它。我讨厌穿插头服，讨厌坐在驾驶舱里，讨厌在战斗中……我讨厌它带来的痛苦。” 碇说的每一个字都完全映射了我对这一切的想法。尽管我表现得好像很喜欢，尽管我接受了训练，说了那么多话，尽管我在这方面确实很出色……我讨厌其中的每一刻。

"I know..." My voice is kept low as we stand there for a few moments in silence.  
“我知道……” 我们站在那里，沉默了几分钟，我的声音保持得很低。

"Why did you leave Asuka?" He suddenly asks me.  
“你为什么离开明日香？” 他突然问我。

"You already know why Shinji." I let you and a sigh and shrug, "I just... didn't feel like I belonged here anymore. I didn't feel like I deserved to be here. I kept on thinking about all the things I was and how I had acted and all the things that had happened to me and I just couldn't face it. I had to get away, to save myself and to save you. Besides, I thought you all hated me."  
"你已经知道为什么了，真嗣。" 我让你叹了口气，耸耸肩，"我只是...不再觉得这里属于我了。我觉得自己不配待在这里。我一直在想我曾经的所作所为，以及发生在我身上的一切，我无法面对。我必须离开，为了救自己，也为了救你。而且，我以为你们都恨我。"

"Asuka..." He lets out a sigh of his own, "Misato... me... Rei... we never hated you... we... wanted to understand. I wanted to understand."  
"明日香..." 他叹了口气，"美里...我...丽...我们从未恨过你...我们...想要理解你。我想要理解你。"

"But you couldn't understand me." I reply to him, "You could barely understand yourself, me being there too... it would have been too much. I think... it was better that I left. Do I regret it? A little bit, maybe the way I did it... maybe the lack of being in touch but I think staying would have hurt us all more."  
"但你无法理解我。" 我回答他，"你连自己都难以理解，再加上我...那会太过沉重。我想...我离开是更好的选择。我后悔吗？或许有一点，也许是我离开的方式...也许是因为失去了联系，但我认为留下来会让我们所有人都更加痛苦。"

I look at him as he mulls over my words. I don't know if he believes me or thinks I'm right. I'm not even sure if I know I'm right. A part of me wishes I had not left, to see how things would have panned out but I do think my staying back than might have caused me to regress, to resent Misato and Shinji more than I had done in the past.  
我看着他沉思我的话。我不知道他是否相信我，或者认为我是对的。我甚至不确定自己是否知道我是对的。我的一部分希望我没有离开，想看看事情会如何发展，但我确实认为如果我当时留下来，可能会导致我退步，对美里和真嗣的怨恨会比过去更深。

"Look... the way I was feeling at that time Shinji." I start to speak again, "I wanted to stay, I wanted to be part of the family but I never felt like I was. You, Misato and Rei... were the family unit and I was the outsider. That was the way it had been and the way I felt like it still was."  
"听着...那时我对真嗣你的感觉。"我开始再次说话，"我想留下来，我想成为家庭的一部分，但我从未觉得自己是。你、美里和丽...你们是家庭单位，而我是个外人。事情一直是这样，我感觉它仍然是这样。"

"That isn't true!" Shinji starts to plead with me but I quickly cut him off.  
"那不是真的！"真嗣开始向我恳求，但我迅速打断了他。

"Maybe it wasn't true but it felt that way." I stop him, "Look at what I was Shinji... I was the soldier who was drafted into this at a young age. I was nothing more than a grunt if you think about it. Given my orders and told what to do, no greater purpose and no knowledge of the truth. Rei... she was made for a reason, she knew the truth and you... you found out what was happening because of who you were but what about me? I was left in the dark. Sure... I felt something was wrong with NERV but I never questioned it."  
"也许那不是真的，但感觉就是那样。" 我打断他，"看看我曾是怎样的人，真嗣...我是个在年幼时就被征召入伍的士兵。如果你仔细想想，我不过是个小兵。接受命令，被告知该做什么，没有更高的目标，也不知道真相。丽...她是为了某个目的而制造的，她知道真相，而你...你是因为你是谁才发现了正在发生的事情，但关于我呢？我被蒙在鼓里。当然...我感觉到 NERV 有些不对劲，但我从未质疑过。"

"I wish I could have told you..." Shinji adds, "But when I found out you were..."  
"我真希望能早点告诉你..." 真嗣补充道，"但当我发现你是..."

"I know." I nod, "I wasn't in any state to be told anything but no one even thought to try. All that stuff about SEELE, about what the Eva's really were, Rei's origins... I found out after the fact and it was just a lot for me to take in. I had to face so much and I just... felt doing it with all of you around wouldn't help. I had to be alone. Like I said... I went about it the wrong way... I should have told you all I was leaving... I should have stayed in contact but I'm stubborn and a fool. I always feel like I have to do these things alone."  
"我知道。" 我点头，"我当时的状态不适合被告知任何事情，但甚至没有人尝试过。关于 SEELE，关于 Eva 真正的身份，丽的起源...我都是在事后才知道的，那对我来说太多了。我不得不面对这么多，我只是...觉得有你们在身边也无济于事。我必须独自面对。就像我说的...我处理这件事的方式错了...我应该告诉你们我要离开...我应该保持联系，但我固执又愚蠢。我总是觉得我必须独自完成这些事情。"

"I think... I understand." he replies after thinking about it for a bit, "I'm sorry you... felt you had to leave."  
"我想...我明白了。" 他沉思片刻后回答，"我很抱歉你...觉得必须离开。"

I wave my hand, "Don't worry about it, you were young... how could you have known what to do. Besides, you had a new sister to deal with and loads of other things going on. Just... know that I am sorry."  
我挥了挥手，"别放在心上，你那时还年轻...怎么可能知道该怎么做。而且，你还要面对新妹妹和其他一堆事情。只是...要知道我也很抱歉。"

"Okay." He nods again, "You know that... even though you think it you didn't always hurt me, right? I know we hurt each other but... I'm grateful that I met you and... living with and being friends with you was one of the few good things I had back then."  
"好的。" 他又点了点头，"你知道...即使你觉得你伤害了我，但其实并非总是如此，对吧？我知道我们彼此伤害过，但...我很感激能遇见你，和你一起生活并成为朋友，那是我当时为数不多的美好回忆之一。"

This time I turn myself around to face him, his words striking a chord with me. I know that when I do look back on those times it wasn't the victories in the Eva, the praise or the pursuit of glory that made me happy. It was being with Shinji... It was being with Hikari... It was spending the night at Misato's watching dumb TV or even doing my homework. It was the comfortable silences we had in the front room and the smell of Shinji's cooking.  
这次我转过身面对他，他的话触动了我。我知道，当我回望那些时光时，让我感到快乐的并非 Eva 中的胜利、赞美或对荣耀的追求。而是与真嗣在一起... 是与光在一起... 是在美里家看无聊的电视或甚至做作业的夜晚。是我们在前厅的舒适沉默和真嗣烹饪的香味。

It was all of those moments, those fleeting moments in between the fear of more pain brought on by the Eva's, the fear I had of the terrors that struck me in the night time, that helped me through and made me feel alive. It was those moments that made me truly happy, they were what allowed me to hold onto the real me, the real me that was slipping further and further away.  
正是这些时刻，那些在 Eva 带来的更多痛苦恐惧和我夜间遭遇的恐怖之间的短暂瞬间，帮助我度过难关并让我感受到生命的活力。正是这些时刻让我真正快乐，它们让我能够抓住真实的自我，那个正逐渐远去的真实的我。

It was a long time before I would ever see her again. I tucked her away in a corner for so long and I tucked away that other Asuka for years when I left Japan. Parts of her would come back to the surface when Rei eventually tracked me down but I tried to keep her locked up. I was so scared that if I let her out properly than the horrible and nasty side of me would follow. It wasn't until Kaworu came into my life and this whole thing started properly that I began to feel I was safe in being... me.  
过了很久我才再次见到她。我把她深藏在心底的角落，离开日本后，也将那个曾经的明日香封存多年。直到绫波最终找到我，她的某些部分才重新浮现，但我尽力将她锁住。我害怕如果完全释放她，我那可怕而丑陋的一面也会随之而来。直到渚薰走进我的生活，这一切才真正开始，我才开始感到自己可以安全地做回...我自己。

I look up at Shinji's face, a part of me ever so slightly irritated to see what he now has even more height on me than before I left. The sun has pretty much set now but the rooftop is lit up more than enough to let me see his face clearly. He's retained his youth well, on his cheeks and chin I can see a few cuts and scratches from where has has shaved, I guess I don't need too long to figure out his stance on facial hair.  
我抬头看着真嗣的脸，心里有一丝不悦，发现他现在比我离开前又长高了不少。太阳已经差不多落山了，但屋顶的光线足够让我清楚地看到他的脸。他保持着很好的青春气息，脸颊和下巴上有几处剃须留下的划痕，我想不用太久就能猜出他对胡须的态度。

I look up into his eyes and I can see the same thing I saw many years ago. Fear, pain, hurt, determination and that desire to be loved and forgiven. It's remarkable what can be seen in a simple pair of blue eyes.  
我凝视着他的眼睛，看到了多年前见过的那些情感。恐惧、痛苦、伤害、决心，以及被爱和原谅的渴望。一双简单的蓝眼睛里竟能映照出如此多的东西，真是不可思议。

"Asuka I..." he starts to speak again, his voice cracking ever so slightly. I can already guess where this is going and prepare myself for the discomfort, "I just wanted you to know that... I know those things I did to you were awful and there is no excuse for it. There is nothing to justify them and... I know I don't deserve forgiveness but I am... truly sorry."  
"明日香，我……" 他再次开口，声音略微有些颤抖。我已经猜到这话题的走向，并准备好迎接那份不适，"我只是想让你知道……我知道我对你做的那些事很糟糕，没有任何借口。没有任何理由可以为之辩解，而且……我知道我不配得到原谅，但我……真的非常抱歉。"

I nod my head at him. I know to not be mad at him for this, this apology isn't just a reflex on his part like they might once have been. It's genuine and sincere. I reach up with my hand and gently cup his cheek, "I know... I forgvie you Shinji and... I know I wasn't the easiest person to live with. So... I'm sorry too, for the abuse I gave you and for acting the way I did."  
我向他点点头。我知道不该为此生他的气，这次道歉不仅仅是他习惯性的反应，而是真诚且发自内心的。我伸出手，轻轻抚摸他的脸颊，"我知道……我原谅你了，真嗣，而且……我知道我并不是一个容易相处的人。所以……我也为我对你的伤害和我的行为道歉。"

I expect Shinji to say something in reply to that but instead he surprises me by wrapping his arms around me and pulling me into a warm embrace. I let my arms wrap themselves around him as I rest my head on his shoulder. There is only us, standing on this rooftop, holding each other in the cool evening air.  
我以为真嗣会对此说些什么，但他却出乎意料地用双臂环抱住我，将我拉入一个温暖的怀抱。我让我的手臂环绕着他，将头靠在他的肩膀上。此刻，只有我们两人，站在这屋顶上，在凉爽的夜风中相拥。

We stand there for a moment wrapped in each other's arms until I eventually lift my head away from his shoulder to once again look straight into his eyes. Our faces are in close proximity now, so close that his breathing is actually tickling my face. I've been here before, haven't I? A long time ago, the time I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  
我们相拥而立，片刻间沉浸在彼此的怀抱中，直到我最终从他的肩头抬起头，再次直视他的双眼。此刻，我们的脸庞近在咫尺，近到他的呼吸竟轻拂过我的脸颊。我曾身处此境，不是吗？很久以前，那次我犯下了人生中最大的错误之一。

It's be so easy to rectify that mistake now, wouldn't it? I could close that distance between us, press my lips up against his and get that thing I had been craving for so very long. I could let myself fall into his arms and not fuck it up this time around. How easy would it be for me to just let myself go, to forget about the rest of the world, everyone else and fulfil that one simple desire.  
现在纠正那个错误是多么容易，不是吗？我可以缩短我们之间的距离，将我的唇贴上他的，满足我长久以来的渴望。我可以让自己沉沦在他的怀抱中，这次不再搞砸。让我就这样放纵自己，忘却世界其他的一切，所有人，只满足那一个简单的愿望，该有多么简单。

I can see the passion in his eyes, I can feel the trembling of his hands and I have to wonder if he can see and feel the same things from me. I have to wonder... is this desire I'm feeling or fear. Maybe it's fear of crossing that line and knowing what it would mean. Knwoing that in correcting one mistake I'd be making a band new mistake. A mistake with much worse repercussions. I'd be hurting myself, Shinji and most of all Kaworu if I were to cross that line.  
我能从他的眼中看到激情，能感受到他双手的颤抖，我不禁想知道他是否也能从我身上看到和感受到同样的东西。我不得不思考...这种感觉是渴望还是恐惧。或许是害怕越过那条线，明白那意味着什么。知道在纠正一个错误的同时，我会犯下一个全新的错误。一个后果更为严重的错误。如果我越过那条线，我会伤害自己，伤害真嗣，最严重的是伤害到薰。

There is a voice deep down inside telling me to do it. To forget about everything else, to fix that situation as it happens. That it's one kiss...one kiss that leads to another, that leads to another and before you know it leads to more. The line... it's so easy to cross, isn't it? We could do it right here and now, no one needs to know. Except we'd know... we'd know we crossed it and neither of us could life with that.  
内心深处有一个声音在告诉我去做。忘掉其他一切，就地解决问题。那只是一个吻...一个吻引向另一个，再引向另一个，在你意识到之前，已经发展成更多。那条线...跨越它是如此容易，不是吗？我们可以现在就在这里做，没有人需要知道。除了我们自己...我们会知道我们越过了它，而我们俩都无法承受这一点。

I'm not in denial about my feelings for Shinji. I have such strong feelings for him but I love... I love Kaworu and I'm with Kaworu. I couldn't betray him, not now and not ever. I've been hurt enough in my own life to hurt someone like this.  
我并没有否认我对真嗣的感情。我对他的感情如此强烈，但我爱...我爱薰，我和薰在一起。我不能背叛他，现在不能，永远不能。我在自己的生活中已经受够了伤害，不能再这样伤害别人。

The line... I won't cross it. It's easy to cross it but bad things are easy and never work out as satisfying as they seem.  
那条线...我不会越过。虽然越过它很容易，但坏事总是容易做，却从未像看起来那样令人满意。

So... I'm sorry about this Shinji but... I'm saving us both by doing this. You know it's the right thing as well. You wouldn't want this. Savor this moment though, use it as a fantasy in which we do go further. I give you permission for that.  
所以...真嗣，对此我很抱歉，但...我这样做是为了我们俩好。你也知道这是正确的选择。你不会希望这样的。尽管如此，享受这一刻吧，把它当作一个我们进一步发展的幻想。我允许你这样想。

I let go of Shinji and take a step back. I look at him as he comes to attention also stepping back and looking rather embarrassed.  
我放开了真嗣，向后退了一步。我看着他，他也站直了身子，后退一步，显得有些尴尬。

"We should get back to the party... they'll probably be concerned about us and... you know what Misato is like."  
"我们该回派对去了...他们可能会担心我们，而且...你知道美里是什么样的。"

Shinji simply nods, "Yeah, we should."  
真嗣只是点点头，"嗯，我们该回去了。"

### Chapter 24: J'entend ton coeur  
第二十四章：我听见你的心跳  

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I lean in carefully and kiss Kodama one more time on the lips before my body gives way and I collapse next to her on the bed. I clumsily drape my arm over her and we both lie there for a few moments, the both of us riding out the waves of our pleasure, our bodies naked and covered in sweat, the only sounds are that of our breathing.  
我小心翼翼地靠近，再次在 Kodama 的唇上轻轻一吻，随后我的身体支撑不住，倒在她旁边的床上。我笨拙地将手臂搭在她身上，我们俩就这样躺了一会儿，两人都在享受着快感的余波，赤裸的身体上满是汗水，唯一的声音就是我们的呼吸声。

After a time, she turns onto her side, props her head up onto her hand and gives me that sweet smile that I couldn't help but fall in love with. With her free hand she idly traces shapes along my stomach and chest.  
过了一会儿，她侧过身来，用手撑着头，对我露出了那个让我无法不坠入爱河的甜美微笑。她用空着的手随意地在我肚子和胸口上画着形状。

"I love you Rei Ayanami."  
“我爱你，绫波零。”

She traces out the shape of a love heart on my stomach as she says it. I smile back at her, my cheeks glowing red at her sudden declaration. I reply, "I love you too Kodama."  
她在我肚子上画出一个爱心形状，同时说出这句话。我回以微笑，脸颊因她突如其来的表白而泛红。我回应道：“我也爱你，小玉。”

I lean in towards her and we kiss once more. As we kiss, I can't help but hope that Kodama knows how sincere I am when I tell her that I love her. I am aware that because of the way I speak, because of the way I look it is not always obvious that I am genuine in my declarations of love or emotion. It has been an issue with previous partners, either they have taken issue with such declarations and ignored them. They... do not make the effort to understand me.  
我向她靠近，我们再次亲吻。在亲吻中，我不禁希望小玉能明白我对她说我爱她时是多么真诚。我知道，由于我说话的方式，我的外表，我的真情流露并不总是显而易见。这在以前的关系中是个问题，要么是他们对此有所质疑并忽视了这些表白，要么……他们没有努力去理解我。

With that said I... I feel like Kodama has made that effort. I feel like she understands me. I have never felt for someone the way I have done for her. So, I... am scared that perhaps she doesn't understand.  
话虽如此，我...我觉得小玉已经付出了那份努力。我感觉她理解我。我从未对任何人有过像对她那样的感觉。所以，我...害怕也许她并不理解。

"You're so cute when you worry about things." She suddenly declared, snapping me away from my worries.  
"你担心事情的时候真可爱。" 她突然宣布，让我从忧虑中回过神来。

"How did you know I was worrying?" I ask her with some confusion in my voice."  
"你怎么知道我在担心？" 我带着些许困惑问她。

She giggles, "It's subtle but I can tell. Your brow furrows just a little bit and I've noticed you tend to bite your bottom lip every so often."  
她轻声笑道：“虽然细微，但我能察觉。你的眉头微微皱起，而且我发现你时不时会咬一下下唇。”

"I... did not notice." I answer back, suddenly more aware of what I'm doing. Her words haven't embarrassed me though, instead they fill me with a sense of optimism. Maybe I am right in believing she understands me, "Then you... know that I am sincere when I say... I love you?"  
“我……没有注意到。”我回答道，突然更加意识到自己的举动。然而，她的话并未让我感到尴尬，反而让我充满了乐观。也许我相信她理解我是对的，“那么你……知道当我真诚地说……我爱你时，我是真心的吗？”

"Of course I know that Rei! I would never question anything like that." She nods and grins before bringing her hand up to my hand and softly running it down through my hair. She rests her hand on my cheek, "Is that what was worrying you?"  
“当然知道，丽！我绝不会怀疑这种事。”她点头微笑，然后抬起手，轻轻地顺着我的头发抚摸下来。她将手放在我的脸颊上，“这就是你在担心的事吗？”

I nod, "I am not... an outwardly expressive person. I have never been like that and I likely never will be. I know that this might be off-putting to another or it might lead them to not believe in what I am saying. To some I might even seem to be without emotion but... I do have emotions."  
我点头，“我不是……一个外向表达的人。我从未那样过，可能永远不会。我知道这可能会让他人感到疏远，或者导致他们不相信我说的话。对某些人来说，我甚至可能显得没有感情，但……我确实有感情。”

"You just express things in a different way. There is nothing wrong with that." Kodama replies to me, her tone gentle and calming, "You are who you are Rei and... I would never want you to be any other way. I love you and... you make me so happy."  
“你只是以不同的方式表达。这没什么不对。”Kodama 回答我，她的语气温柔而安抚，“你是你，Rei，而且……我永远不会希望你变成别的样子。我爱你，而且……你让我如此快乐。”

"And you make me happy too." I smile at her as I playfully push her onto her back and climb onto her, snuggling my head onto her chest, "I can hear your heart, it's fast."  
“你也让我快乐。”我笑着对她，调皮地将她推倒并爬到她身上，把头埋在她胸前，“我能听到你的心跳，很快。”

She laughs again, "It's still pounding because of you. You were... enthusiastic tonight."  
她又笑了，“还是因为你心跳得厉害。你今晚……很热情。”

"I felt like celebrating." I answer, as I run my hand up along the sides of her body. As I do this, I feel her wrap her arms around me and start to run her hands over me. I let out a soft sigh as her fingertips gently brush along my stomach and up to my breasts.  
“我想庆祝一下。”我回答，同时手沿着她的身体两侧向上游走。就在这时，我感觉到她用双臂环抱住我，开始在我身上抚摸。当她的指尖轻轻掠过我的腹部，向上触碰到我的胸部时，我轻轻叹了口气。

"Do Kaworu seemed open to the idea?" Kodama asks me.  
“渚看起来对这个主意感兴趣吗？”儿玉问我。

I nod as I let out another sigh as her hands caress me. I try to ignore the stirrings within me for the moment, "I think so... I spoke to him about it and he seemed to understand but I am still... unsure about Asuka and Shinji. I know they all have feelings for each other but... I don't know if they would consider it."  
我点点头，随着她的手轻抚我而再次叹息。我试图暂时忽略内心的悸动，“我想是的...我和他谈过这件事，他似乎理解了，但我对明日香和真嗣还是...不确定。我知道他们彼此都有感情，但是...我不确定他们是否会考虑这样做。”

Kodama's hand moves down to my leg and she slowly begins to slide it upwards, I let out another sigh as I anticipate her touch there, much to my disappointment she stops nearly inches away to answer my question, "We gave them the idea and a little bit of a nudge. I think that is all they need. Nature will take its course."  
Kodama 的手移到我的腿上，慢慢地向上滑动，我再次叹息，期待着她的触碰，令我失望的是，她几乎只差几英寸就停了下来，回答我的问题，“我们给了他们这个想法，稍稍推动了一下。我认为这就足够了。自然会顺其发展。”

"So... we shouldn't do anything else?" I ask.  
“那么...我们不应该再做其他事了吗？”我问道。

"No, nothing else." She shakes her head, "We give them the idea and the support but it's up to them. It's like you said... we shouldn't try to matchmake or force them. If they want to then... they do but if not then it isn't to be."  
"不，别的没什么了。" 她摇摇头，"我们提供想法和支持，但决定权在他们。就像你说的……我们不应该撮合或强迫他们。如果他们愿意，那就顺其自然；如果不愿意，那也不必强求。"

"Good I... would not be comfortable in any sort of manipulation."  
"很好，我……对任何形式的操纵都不自在。"

"Neither would I, we just need to give it time." She kisses the top of my head before whispering to me, "For now though... I think that maybe we should celebrate just a bit more."  
"我也是，我们只需耐心等待。" 她亲吻我的头顶，然后对我耳语，"不过现在……我想我们或许应该再庆祝一下。"

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

_I feel sick. 我感觉不舒服。_

I almost kissed him. I was so close to kissing Shinji fucking Ikari. I was merely second away of doing it, our lips were centimeters away, my mind was only a few words away from convincing me. I was close, so very close and god, I hate myself so much for it. I hate myself for considering betraying Kaworu like that, if only for a second.  
我差点就吻了他。我差点就吻了真嗣·伊卡里。只差一秒我就要吻上去了，我们的唇只隔了几厘米，我的脑海里只差几句话就能说服自己。我离得那么近，非常非常近，天哪，我真恨自己。我恨自己竟然考虑过那样背叛薰，哪怕只是一瞬间。

Even worst, I hate myself for feeling a slight tinge of regret at not going through with it.  
更糟糕的是，我恨自己对没有付诸行动感到一丝后悔。

The feeling has been there since it happened. It's gnawing at me, berating me for being such a coward. It tells me that I betrayed myself, that I betrayed the Asuka Langley Soryu who claimed that she wasn't afraid of anything, that she didn't care who she stood on or hurt to get what she wanted, not only what she wanted but what she deserved.  
这种感觉从那时起就一直存在。它在啃噬我，责骂我是个懦夫。它告诉我，我背叛了自己，背叛了那个声称无所畏惧、为了得到想要的东西——不仅仅是想要，还有应得的东西——不惜站在任何人之上或伤害任何人的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

Yes, I betrayed her. I betrayed that version of me from the past because I don't deserve to kiss Shinji. I don't have a right to him and I sure as hell am not going to hurt Kaworu to try to correct some stupid mistake I made years ago.  
是的，我背叛了她。我背叛了过去的自己，因为我没有资格亲吻真嗣。我没有权利拥有他，我绝不会为了纠正多年前的一个愚蠢错误而去伤害渚薰。

Yet, the voice is there.  
然而，那个声音依然存在。

_'Pathetic, you've been waiting years for a moment like this and you ran away. You coward!'  
'可悲，你等了这么多年就为了这样一个时刻，你却逃跑了。你这个懦夫！'_

I didn't run away damnit. I saved myself, I saved Shinji and I save Kaworu from the pain of what we would all have to go through if we cross that line.  
我他妈的没有逃跑。我救了自己，救了真嗣，也救了渚免受如果我们越过那条线所必须经历的痛苦。

Yet, the voice shouts back at me.  
然而，那声音对我大喊回来。

_'So what if you do betray Kaworu? Look at who he is, what he is! Look at what he did to Shinji all those years ago. He tore that boy apart! Do you not think Shinji deserves some revenge for that? Don't you think we deserve some vengeance too! He tried to take our Unit 2, he tried to take mama!'  
“就算你背叛了渚又怎样？看看他是什么人，他是什么东西！看看他多年前对真嗣做了什么。他把那孩子撕碎了！你不觉得真嗣应该为此得到一些报复吗？你不觉得我们也应该得到一些复仇吗！他试图夺走我们的二号机，他试图夺走妈妈！”_

I look at myself in the mirror and resist the sudden urge to drive my fist through it. My reflection stares back at me wearing a scowl and my features now turned the whitest shade of pale. For a brief moment I wonder if maybe I'm going mad, trying to answer to a voice in my head but I remind myself that everyone is going through this. Everyone has these doubts and fears, these ghosts of the past that try to hurt us. Shinji has them, Rei does, Misato does and I know for a fact Kaworu does.  
我对着镜子中的自己，强忍住突然想一拳砸碎它的冲动。我的倒影回望着我，眉头紧锁，面色苍白得吓人。有那么一瞬间，我怀疑自己是否疯了，试图回应脑海中的声音，但我提醒自己，每个人都在经历这些。每个人都有这些疑虑和恐惧，这些试图伤害我们的过去的幽灵。真嗣有，绫波有，美里有，我敢肯定，渚薰也有。

Deep breaths Asuka... take some deep breaths.  
深呼吸，明日香……深呼吸。

The Asuka that I hear, the voices from many years ago. She is me and I am her. Those voices are a part of me but I know what they are. They're the result of fear, fear of being hurt and fear of being weak. Well I'm Asuka Langley Soryu damnit, and I'm going to kick fears ass!  
我听到的明日香，那些多年前的话语。她就是我，我就是她。那些声音是我的一部分，但我明白它们是什么。它们是恐惧的结果，害怕受伤，害怕软弱。好吧，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，该死的，我要战胜恐惧！

I did the right thing. I knew fine well that coming here to Japan and seeing Shinji again wasn't going to be easy. I knew that it'd awaken the feelings I have for him. I didn't expect us to get as close as we did tonight but I also would never cross that line. I love Kaworu and regardless of my feelings for Shinji I am not going to betray him and I'm not going to leave him. I did the right thing tonight. I know it and Shinji will know it as well.  
我做对了。我很清楚，来到日本再次见到真嗣不会是件容易的事。我知道这会唤醒我对他的感情。我没想到我们今晚能如此亲近，但我也不会越过那条线。我爱渚薰，无论我对真嗣的感情如何，我都不会背叛他，也不会离开他。今晚我做对了。我知道，真嗣也会明白的。

We got close tonight, maybe we allowed ourselves to get too close but it was natural. We ahven't seen each other for a long time and there is still a lot to be resolved. We've been in touch for a short while again and already so much has happened. Still, we didn't do anything because we both know that crossing the line would be wrong. Maybe things will be awkward as a result of this but it can help us. It proves we can be adults about certain things now.  
今晚我们走得很近，也许我们让自己靠得太近了，但这是自然而然的。我们已经很久没见面了，还有很多事情需要解决。我们短暂地重新联系了一段时间，已经发生了这么多事。尽管如此，我们什么都没做，因为我们俩都知道越线是错误的。也许这会导致一些尴尬，但它能帮助我们。这证明我们现在可以成熟地处理某些事情了。

As far as me considering kissing him and maybe feeling regret. Is that not natural? The mind... can wander but it's when you take action or let it go too far then it becomes a problem. We didn't take action and we haven't let anything go too far. We are exorcising those feelings for each other and yes... I do feel awful for considering but I didn't do anything.  
我考虑过亲吻他，或许还会感到后悔。这难道不自然吗？心智...会游离，但当你采取行动或任其发展过深时，问题就来了。我们没有采取行动，也没有让事情失控。我们正在驱散彼此间的那些情感，是的...我确实为考虑过而感到糟糕，但我什么也没做。

I take a few more deep breaths to calm myself and go back over those points in my head a few more times. Each loop makes me feel a little bit more at ease. I'm not pleased or proud of tonight at all. I know it was bad for us to get close and I won't let it happen again but we did stop it, we actually stopped it and came out of it unharmed. I can take solace in that.  
我又深呼吸几次以平复心情，并在脑海中反复回想这些要点。每一次循环都让我感觉稍微安心一些。我一点也不为今晚感到高兴或自豪。我知道我们不该走得太近，我不会再让这种情况发生，但我们确实阻止了它，我们真的阻止了它，并且毫发无损地走了出来。我可以从中找到一些安慰。

Happy Birthday to me I guess! What gift did I bestow upon myself? Guilt, shame and more to debate with myself.  
我想，祝我生日快乐吧！我给了自己什么礼物呢？愧疚、羞耻，还有更多自我辩论的烦恼。

I turn to look back towards the bedroom. Kaworu is fast asleep, no ide about what happened or at least, nearly happened tonight. He has no idea me and Shinji got that close. I have no idea if I should actually tell him. What do you say about something like that?  
我转身望向卧室。渚薰正沉沉入睡，对今晚发生的事，或者至少是差点发生的事一无所知。他不知道我和真嗣走得那么近。我不知道是否应该告诉他。这种事该怎么说呢？

_'Oh hey Kaworu, though you should know. Me and Shinji almost kissed tonight, but we did stop ourselves before so... never mind eh?'  
'哦，嘿，渚薰，你应该知道。我和真嗣今晚差点接吻了，但我们及时停下了……所以，没什么大不了的，对吧？'_

Still I... I want to tell someone. I want to just make sure I did do the right thing and that I shouldn't feel this much guilt. I have to tell someone because... as much as I hate to admit it, I can't deal with this alone. I pull my phone out of my bad and quickly scroll to a name in my address book and type out a message.  
尽管如此，我……我想告诉某个人。我想确认自己确实做了正确的事，我不应该感到如此内疚。我必须告诉某个人，因为……尽管我不愿承认，我无法独自应对这一切。我从包里拿出手机，迅速翻到通讯录中的一个名字，开始编辑信息。

_'Rei, need to speak to you. Hotel bar in 10? Asuka x'  
'丽，需要和你谈谈。十分钟后酒店酒吧见？明日香 x'_

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

_I'm the lowest... 我是最底层的..._

_I'm scum... I'm horrible... I'm a coward, a sneak, detestable...  
我是渣滓...我太糟糕了...我是个懦夫，是个卑鄙小人，令人憎恶..._

I almost kissed her. I wanted to kiss her. Even though I know she has a boyfriend, even though that boyfriend is my friend I was so close to doing it, I wanted to do it. If she hadn't have said something to stop me than I would have done. I'd have committed the ultimate betrayal, after all that had happened, after he had forgiven me for the actions that I thought were unforgivable.  
我差点就吻了她。我想吻她。尽管我知道她有男朋友，尽管那个男朋友是我的朋友，我还是差点就那么做了，我真的很想那么做。如果她没有说些什么来阻止我，我就会那么做了。我本会犯下终极的背叛，毕竟发生了那么多事，毕竟他曾原谅了我那些我认为不可饶恕的行为。

The worst thing is that... I actually regret not kissing her. I regret not reaching up with my hand, running it through her hair, cupping her cheek, tilting her head up and pressing my lips against hers. I regret not looking into her eyes, correcting the mistake from years ago and saying the words I've been wanting to say for so long.  
最糟糕的是……我其实后悔没有吻她。我后悔没有伸出手，穿过她的发丝，捧起她的脸颊，轻轻抬起她的头，将我的唇贴上她的。我后悔没有凝视她的眼睛，纠正多年前犯下的错误，说出那些我渴望已久的话。

_I love you Asuka. 我爱你，明日香。_

Those words ring in my head, of course I love her! I love her because I'm such a horrible person. That's all I'll ever be! Asuka has someone, she is in love with them and they are in love with her. I should forget all about her. I should stop these foolish thoughts. Only... I can't... because I'm the lowest of the low! I'm a horrible excuse for a human being. I'm...  
那些话在我脑海中回响，我当然爱她！我爱她因为我是个如此糟糕的人。我永远只会是那样！明日香有人了，她爱着那个人，那个人也爱着她。我应该忘了她。我应该停止这些愚蠢的想法。只是...我做不到...因为我卑鄙至极！我是个糟糕透顶的人类。我...

I drive my fist forward in anger, it comes into contact with my pillow and I watch as the damn thing flies off the bed and lands on the floor of my bedroom. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate what I near did and I hate my stupid reaction to it.  
我愤怒地挥拳向前，拳头击中枕头，看着那该死的东西从床上飞出去，落在卧室地板上。我讨厌这样。我讨厌这样。我讨厌这样。我讨厌我差点做的事，也讨厌我愚蠢的反应。

My brain has taken wat nearly happened as the confirmation it needed to justify all those horrible things I've been thinking about myself. It's seen what nearly happened, what I nearly did and my thoughts as some confirmation that I'm this evil and horrible person.  
我的大脑把几乎发生的事情当作了它需要的确认，来证明我对自己所有那些可怕的想法。它看到了几乎发生的事，我几乎做的事，以及我的想法，都成了我是这个邪恶又糟糕的人的证据。

What is it with me? Why do I have this need to hate myself so much? Why am I unable to see myself as anything other than a bad person? Is this your doing father? Is this the gift I got from you when I was born? You couldn't keep your own self-hatred within so it spread and branded itself onto my soul?  
我这是怎么了？为何我如此强烈地憎恨自己？为何我无法将自己视作一个好人？这一切都是你造成的吗，父亲？这是我出生时你赐予我的‘礼物’吗？你无法控制自己的自我厌恶，于是它蔓延开来，烙印在我的灵魂上？

I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you and what you did to me!  
我恨你！我恨你！我恨你！我恨你和你对我所做的一切！

All of this that I feel, every little piece of negativity it all goes back to you doesn't it father? You imprinted it onto me, the Rokubungi family curse. I hate myself just like my father before me, just like your father before you and so on. Fuyutsuki told me what your parents were like, he said they weren't good people either. This is what they gave to me!  
我感受到的这一切，每一丝负面情绪，都归咎于你，不是吗，父亲？你将它刻印在我身上，六分仪家族的诅咒。我像我父亲一样憎恨自己，就像你父亲在你之前一样，代代相传。冬月告诉我你的父母是怎样的人，他说他们也不是好人。这就是他们留给我的！

This need, these feelings, they were always going to be there. Lurking in the background and seizing any opportunity. It's hereditary, runs in families, just like any illness.  
这种需求，这些情感，它们始终存在。潜伏在幕后，伺机而动。这是遗传的，在家族中流传，就像任何疾病一样。

I know the facts. It's an illness, no matter how I was raised I would have been susceptible to it. I could have been raised by two loving and present parents and had an amazing childhood and still that depression could rise to the surface. Only in my case my past helped it, the issues I fixate on are all influenced by it.  
我了解这些事实。这是一种疾病，无论我如何被抚养长大，我都容易受到它的影响。我本可以由两位充满爱心且时刻在场的父母抚养，拥有一个美好的童年，但抑郁症仍可能浮现。只是在我这里，我的过去助长了它，我所纠结的问题都受到它的影响。

It feeds on the fears and feelings I had from a young age. He helped put them there. He feared other people, he feared hurting me and being hurt by me. So, he pushed me away but in him doing that... my depression... my anxiety fed on it. He abandoned me to save himself but it only sowed a seed within me that it fed on. I felt like I had done something wrong, like I was to blame and not worthy of love.  
它以我幼年时的恐惧和感受为食。他帮助植入了这些情绪。他害怕他人，害怕伤害我，也害怕被我伤害。因此，他推开了我，但在他这样做的同时...我的抑郁...我的焦虑以此为食。他为了自保而抛弃了我，但这只是在我心中种下了一颗它赖以生存的种子。我感到自己做了什么错事，好像我应该受到责备，不配得到爱。

I let out a sigh of annoyance. Why does this have to happen now, why are these thoughts here now? I'm days away from this concert. I'm already nervous enough about performing in front of an audience that contains my friends and family without having this on top of me. I should be enjoying this moment and embracing it not... being like this.  
我无奈地叹了口气。为什么这种事非得现在发生，为什么这些念头现在冒出来？距离演唱会只剩几天了。我本就对在包含亲朋好友的观众面前表演感到紧张，现在还要加上这个。我应该享受这一刻，拥抱它，而不是……这样。

Then again... they do say musicians perform better when under stress or some sort of trauma. If that's true then I'll be the best performer in the world in a couple of nights time.  
不过……人们常说，音乐家在压力或某种创伤下表现更佳。如果这是真的，那么几夜之后，我将成为世界上最出色的表演者。

I sit myself up on the bed and reach down to pick up the pillow and try to calm myself down. I need to break the cycle, I need to think about this properly... I need to do something but I don't know what. When I think about it logically I... I almost kissed Asuka but I didn't actually do it. All that happened was I felt strong feelings towards her but we stopped ourselves.  
我坐起身，伸手拿起枕头，试图让自己平静下来。我需要打破这个循环，我需要认真思考……我需要做些什么，但我不知道该做什么。理智地想，我……我差点吻了明日香，但实际上并没有。发生的一切只是我对她产生了强烈的感情，但我们及时制止了自己。

I know Asuka is with someone and it would have been wrong to do anything but I... I'm allowed to have feelings for someone, aren't I? It isn't wrong to love someone, it's how you act that changes things.  
我知道明日香已经有了别人，除了什么都不做之外，其他任何行为都是错误的，但我...我难道就不能对某个人产生感情吗？爱一个人本身并没有错，关键在于你的行为如何改变一切。

It was no different to when I was out with Kaworu the other night. I... I felt things for him. I envisioned kissing him too. We didn't get as close as me and Asuka did but we still got pretty close. I could picture kissing him then too but I didn't.  
这与前几晚我和渚薰出去时的情况没什么不同。我...我对他的感觉很特别。我甚至想象过亲吻他。我们虽然没有像我和明日香那样亲密，但也相当接近了。那时我也能想象亲吻他的情景，但我没有那么做。

Logically I... I have done nothing wrong. As if logic actually matters when it comes to my brain.  
从逻辑上讲，我...我并没有做错什么。但当涉及到我的内心时，逻辑似乎根本不重要。

I just... I need to go through this and keep reminding myself I'm not a bad person and I've done nothing wrong. My focus for the next few days should be practicing for the concert and if I need to speak to someone... maybe Rei? She'll know the right things to say.  
我只是...我需要经历这一切，并不断提醒自己我不是个坏人，我什么也没做错。接下来几天的重点应该是为音乐会练习，如果我需要和某人谈谈...也许丽？她会知道该说些什么。

For now, I look at my pillow and feel my eyes getting heavier. Sleep seems like a good idea, put tonight behind me and start properly tomorrow.  
现在，我看着我的枕头，感到眼皮越来越重。睡觉似乎是个好主意，把今晚抛在脑后，明天重新开始。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

_I look at the two of them, I smile and nod, "I love you Asuka... I love you Shinji."  
我看着他们俩，微笑着点头，“我爱你，明日香...我爱你，真嗣。”_

_It is Asuka who speaks next, reaching over to cup Shinji's cheek and softly stroking the boy's face, "I love you Shinji, I love you Kaworu."  
接下来是明日香开口，她伸手捧住真嗣的脸颊，温柔地抚摸着少年的脸庞，“我爱你，真嗣，我也爱卡沃鲁。”_

_I turn to see the deep blush on Shinji's cheek, "I love the two of you as well."  
我转头看到真嗣脸颊上的深红，“我也爱你们两个。”_

_I feel only warmth as the three of us embrace one another and fall asleep in each other's arms. Each of us sleeping peacefully, holding onto each other for warmth and love. There is no more fear, no more negative feeling, we're all together, propping each other up and sharing the love we have for one another.  
我们三人相拥而眠，心中只有温暖。彼此依偎，安然入睡，互相给予温暖与爱。不再有恐惧，不再有负面情绪，我们在一起，互相支持，分享着对彼此的爱。_

Those are the thoughts that run through my head at this moment in time at least. Those are the scenes that my mind has conjured up based on Rei's words. We embrace each other, give each other sweet little kisses and smile at one another, we deliver sweet declarations of love to each other.  
至少在这一刻，这些念头在我脑海中盘旋。这些场景是根据丽的话，我的心灵所编织出来的。我们相拥而泣，互相给予甜蜜的小吻，相视而笑，向彼此倾诉着甜蜜的爱意宣言。

I let out a little laugh, I know of course such a scene probably wouldn't be possible. If there is one major different between the portrayal of romance in the media and romance in real life it's that sleeping next to your partner is not an easy task. Sleeping with them in your arms or in their arms is night on impossible and if by some chance you do fall asleep, you usually wake up in some discomfort.  
我轻声笑了出来，当然知道这样的场景或许不太可能发生。如果说媒体中的浪漫与现实生活中的浪漫有一个主要区别，那就是与伴侣同床共枕并非易事。拥抱着对方入睡几乎是不可能的，即便偶然间睡着了，通常也会在不适中醒来。

Still... the rest of it... the declarations of love... us all being together. Something about it just seems right. Would it be possible?  
尽管如此...其余的部分...那些爱的宣言...我们所有人在一起。不知为何，这一切似乎都是对的。这有可能吗？

Since I spoke to Rei earlier tonight, I've gone over the idea a vast number of times. I admit, the idea is appealing, this idea that me, Asuka and Shinji could be in a relationship together. Still I have to ask again, is it possible? Would something like that even work?  
自从今晚和丽谈过之后，我已经反复思考过这个想法无数次了。我承认，这个想法很吸引人，就是我和明日香、真嗣三人能在一起的关系。但我还是得再问一次，这可能吗？这样的关系真的能行得通吗？

It leads me to another thing I have learned, relationships are rewarding but they aren't always easy. They require work between those involved. For people like myself and Asuka this is certainly the case, especially when you consider the people we are. We have a lot of issues to resolve, we have a lot of insecurity to deal with. Would introducing a third person to this not just add to the complications we already face? Considering that person is Shinji, I do have to wonder.  
这让我想到了另一件我学到的事，关系虽然有回报，但并不总是容易的。它们需要关系中的人共同努力。像我和明日香这样的人尤其如此，尤其是考虑到我们的性格。我们有很多问题需要解决，有很多不安全感需要面对。引入第三个人不会只是增加我们已经面临的复杂性吗？考虑到那个人是真嗣，我确实不得不思考这个问题。

Still, what Rei said to me is true. I do love Shinji and I do love Asuka. I know for a fact that Asuka loves Shinji and that she loves me. I know that Shinji loves Asuka and... I can see the feelings he has for me as well. I saw them shine through the other night when we took that walk together. I saw it in his eyes, I saw it in how he smiled at me, I could feel it in how he held me when we took that selfie. He was at peace, he was comfortable and there was a connection.  
尽管如此，丽对我说的话是真的。我的确爱着真嗣，也爱着明日香。我确信明日香爱着真嗣，也爱着我。我知道真嗣爱着明日香，而且……我也能感受到他对我的感情。那天晚上我们一起散步时，我看到了这些感情在他身上闪耀。我看到了他的眼神，看到了他对我微笑的方式，我能感受到他拍自拍照时拥抱我的方式。他很平静，很自在，有一种联系。

It was a much stronger connection than the one I felt many years ago. Of course, I was no longer under the control of SEELE, I was no longer influenced by the call of Lillith, I was not and am not here to deceive. I could just be me, I could be Kaworu Nagisa.  
这种联系比多年前我感受到的要强烈得多。当然，我不再受 SEELE 的控制，不再受莉莉丝的召唤影响，我不是，也不会在这里欺骗。我可以做我自己，我可以是渚薰。

For a moment... there was even a part of me that could have leaned in and kissed him. I could have cupped his cheek, smiled at him and told him all would be alright and kissed him softly on his lips. Of course, I would not do such a thing. To do so would have been a betrayal of what me and Asuka have, it would only cause more pain for the three of us. I do feel for him, but no so much that I would or could jeopardize what I have.  
有那么一刻……我甚至有一部分想靠近他并亲吻他。我可以捧着他的脸颊，对他微笑，告诉他一切都会好起来，然后轻轻地吻他的嘴唇。当然，我不会做这样的事。这样做会背叛我和明日香之间的感情，只会给我们三个人带来更多的痛苦。我确实对他有感觉，但并没有强烈到我会或能够危及我所拥有的。

Still... Rei's idea, if the three of us were together, If we allowed ourselves to face the reality of what the three of us feel then there would be no potential for betrayal, there would be no potential for hurting one another, there would be no fear of losing someone to another, there would be... us.  
尽管如此...丽的主意，如果我们三个人在一起，如果我们允许自己面对我们三人之间的真实感受，那么就不会有背叛的可能，不会有人伤害彼此，不会有人担心失去对方给另一个人，只会...有我们。

I am not so ignorant to think that perhaps similar thoughts haven't entered Asuka's mind concerning kissing Shinji, or that he has no considered kissing Asuka. I hope... I would hope that they would not do such a thing behind my back. I would be hurt by that but them thinking about it... it is natural for them to do so, especially when our feelings for each other are so strong... so why not just do this?  
我并非无知到认为阿斯卡关于亲吻真嗣的想法，或是他未曾考虑过亲吻阿斯卡，这些念头从未进入她的脑海。我希望...我真心希望他们不会在我背后做出这样的事。我会因此受伤，但他们只是想想...这很自然，尤其是当我们对彼此的感情如此强烈时...那为什么不干脆这样做呢？

The seed that Rei has planted in my mind, it has taken root and is starting to grow. It seems like such a simple and obvious suggestion but I do have questions and reservations. Could it actually work? In an ideal world, yes it probably would. Yet, this world is not an ideal one and Shinji and Asuka are still human at their very core, even me and my alien upbringing and nature still clings to what can be seen as traditional human values.  
丽在我心中种下的种子，已经生根发芽，开始成长。这看似是一个简单而明显的建议，但我确实有些疑问和顾虑。它真的能行得通吗？在一个理想的世界里，或许可以。然而，这个世界并不完美，真嗣和阿斯卡本质上仍是人类，即便我有着外星的成长背景和天性，依然坚守着传统的人类价值观。

The concept of two people in a relationship is ingrained in most of human culture. It is the 'default', the 'standard', the 'normal', so to speak. There are cultures that have or do practice forms of polyamory but they are usually met with suspicion or derision. It has unfortunately been the case that in some cases of multiple partners it is the result of manipulation or some form of abuse.  
两人关系的概念深深植根于大多数人类文化之中。可以说是‘默认’、‘标准’、‘正常’的。有些文化确实实践或接受多角恋形式，但这些通常会遭到怀疑或嘲笑。不幸的是，在某些多伴侣关系中，这往往是操纵或某种形式虐待的结果。

Yet I know there are genuine examples of relationships with multiple partners within this world. I know that there are cases where there is no power imbalance, no manipulation and what happens is healthy. So, I know that it can work.  
然而，我知道在这个世界上存在着真正健康的多伴侣关系实例。我知道有些情况下不存在权力失衡，没有操纵，关系是健康的。所以，我知道这可以行得通。

I am also more than aware of the sexual side of multiple partners. It would seem that within the realm of pornography, threesomes and group sex are some of the more popular types of content. It is seen as something of an ultimate fantasy. I know that such videos are staged, the people involved very rarely in an actual relationship or in the cases in which the couple were in a relationship it was an outsider or someone they had no connection with.  
我也非常清楚多伴侣关系的性方面。在色情内容领域，三人行和群交似乎是最受欢迎的类型之一。它被视为一种终极幻想。我知道这类视频是表演出来的，参与者很少真正处于一段关系中，或者在那些确实有情侣参与的情况下，第三方通常是他们没有情感联系的人。

The reality of a threesome seemed to be a bit darker. Many daytime TV shows or articles discussion threesomes gone wrong. A couple inviting a third person in and issues with infidelity or jealousy arose much later. Still, I wonder why things went wrong in these cases? Lack of communication? Lack of boundaries? Perhaps one of them was just trying to please their partner? Maybe they didn't realize the connection.  
三人行的现实似乎更为阴暗。许多日间电视节目或文章都在讨论三人行出错的情况。一对情侣邀请第三者加入，随后出现了不忠或嫉妒的问题。尽管如此，我仍想知道这些案例中为何会出错？缺乏沟通？缺乏界限？或许其中一人只是试图取悦他们的伴侣？也许他们没有意识到这种联系。

For us three... We would have that communication, that connection, we would be building this relationship on our love for one another. Away from the warnings, away from the pornography there are genuine examples of such things working. People can break with tradition and forge the path they want. So, I can take heart knowing such things are possbile.  
对于我们三人...我们将拥有那种沟通，那种联系，我们将基于彼此的爱来建立这段关系。远离那些警告，远离色情内容，确实存在成功的真实例子。人们可以打破传统，开辟他们想要的道路。因此，我知道这些事情是可能的，这让我感到欣慰。

Perhaps then, it could be possible for Shinji, Asuka and I?  
那么，或许这对真嗣、明日香和我来说也是可能的？

Again, my mind goes back to that scenario I envisioned earlier. It goes through other scenarios. The three of us together in the apartment, taking it in turns to cook meals for each other, playing games together or just relaxing and cuddling on the couch.  
又一次，我的思绪回到了之前设想的那一幕。它穿梭于其他场景之间。我们三人一起在公寓里，轮流为彼此做饭，一起玩游戏，或者只是放松地蜷缩在沙发上互相依偎。

Again, my mind throws up doubts. Asuka and Shinji are not like me. They are human and I am... I'm an alien raised by humans. They are perhaps not quite as open minded as I am when it comes to such things. For me love... is love but for them love might be rooted in tradition. For us, it could be the case that we might not be as equal as I think we would be. One might feel jealous of another, one might feel frozen out. What if one would argue and feel the other is taking sides? How do you mediate such a thing?  
又一次，我的心中涌现出疑虑。明日香和真嗣不像我。他们是人类，而我……我是一个由人类抚养长大的外星人。在这些问题上，他们可能没有我这么开放。对我来说，爱就是爱，但对他们而言，爱可能植根于传统。我们之间，可能并不像我想象的那样平等。一个人可能会嫉妒另一个，一个人可能会感到被排斥。如果有人争吵并觉得对方偏袒怎么办？你该如何调解这样的事情？

It could even be the case that by suggesting the idea would ruin the love me and Asuka share. It could ruin my friendship with Shinji. Asuka could see it as confirmation that I am looking elsewhere. Shinji could see it as me trying to manipulate him.  
甚至有可能，提出这个想法会毁掉我和明日香之间的爱。它可能会破坏我和真嗣的友谊。明日香可能会认为这是我在寻找其他人的证据。真嗣可能会认为我在试图操纵他。

The scenarios, the fantasies are just that, they are fantasy. They're not practical and for each article that touts a success there is another that shows a failure.  
那些设想，那些幻想，仅此而已，它们是虚幻的。它们不切实际，每篇宣扬成功的文章背后，都有另一篇展示失败的例子。

Further to the point, how do I even suggest such a thing to them? Would I get them together in a room with me and tell them then? Do I speak to Asuka first or speak to Shinji first? It would surely be unfair to drop such a bombshell on the both of them together but it'd also be unfair to tell one and not the other would it not?  
更进一步说，我该如何向他们提出这样的建议呢？我是否应该把他们聚在一个房间里，然后告诉他们？我是先和明日香谈，还是先和真嗣谈？同时向他们两人抛出这样的重磅炸弹肯定不公平，但只告诉其中一人而不告诉另一个，难道就公平吗？

I admit, I have doubts as well. The fear of one being frozen out, both of those would have it and so would I. Perhaps it would be Asuka and Shinji who grow closer and I am frozen out, cast aside. Maybe... No, that is not it. I should not be suspicious of Rei. I do not believe her to be that devious.  
我承认，我也有疑虑。害怕被排斥，他们俩都会面临这种情况，我也一样。也许明日香和真嗣会变得更亲近，而我却被排除在外，被抛弃。也许...不，不是这样的。我不应该怀疑丽。我不认为她会那么狡猾。

What she has told me will be true and correct, at least she believes it to be true and correct. Yet, I do not know how to proceed with this information. What do I do next?  
她告诉我的将会是真实且正确的，至少她相信这一点。然而，我不知该如何处理这些信息。接下来我该做什么？

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I look at the clock on the wall to see that it's just turned one a.m, the hotel bar is pretty much empty save for myself, a businessman in the corner left behind to sleep away his drunkenness and a tired barman who has set himself the task of wiping away all the watery circles left behind by the glasses of this evening patrons.  
我瞥了一眼墙上的时钟，发现刚过凌晨一点，酒店酒吧几乎空无一人，除了我，角落里还有一个被留下来的商人正在酣睡以驱散醉意，以及一位疲惫的酒保，他正忙着擦拭今晚顾客留下的玻璃杯水渍。

I shift my gaze to the lobby and see a young family stood there with their suitcases placed on the floor, in the mother's arms is a young child wriggling to be put down and holding the father's hand is a yawning boy. I assume they're waiting for a taxi to come and take them back to the airport, so they can catch an early morning flight back to wherever it is in the world they're from.  
我将目光转向大堂，看到一个年轻家庭站在那里，行李箱放在地上，母亲怀里抱着一个扭动着想下来的小孩，而打着哈欠的男孩则牵着父亲的手。我猜他们是在等出租车来接他们回机场，以便赶早班飞机回到他们来自的世界的某个地方。

Kodama is upstairs, having fallen asleep not long after we finished making love. I think about my girlfriend, how my life is so much better now for her being in it. It is strange how a chance encounter can lead to something so fulfilling, I was not even thinking about being in a relationship when I met her on that day and yet something about her stuck with me. The more we spoke the more I liked, she also seemed to be one of the few who understood me.  
小灵正在楼上，我们在做完爱后不久她就睡着了。我想着我的女朋友，因为她的存在，我的生活变得美好许多。真是奇妙，一次偶然的相遇竟能带来如此满足的关系，那天遇见她时我甚至没考虑过谈恋爱，但她的某些特质却深深吸引了我。我们聊得越多，我就越喜欢她，她似乎也是少数能理解我的人之一。

There are very few I know who do understand, Asuka is one of them and perhaps there was a time when I would have liked to have been involved with her but I know her heart has always belonged elsewhere and I am fine with that. Asuka however, is the reason I am in this bar at this time of night, she messaged me not long after Kodama had fallen asleep, just as I was drifting off to sleep myself.  
我认识的人中很少有能理解的，明日香是其中之一，或许曾经有一段时间我会想和她在一起，但我知道她的心一直属于别处，我对此并无异议。然而，明日香正是我深夜在这家酒吧的原因，小灵睡着后不久，我正要入睡时，她给我发了消息。

While I'm waiting, I find myself just observing and thinking about various things. I think about this bar, this hotel, they are places that never really close. A person's shift will end for another's to immediately begin, there is no moment in which things are left unoccupied. The family I see in the lobby, they are waiting to go home but in half an hour another family might arrive and check in. Two weeks from now that family may leave and be replaced by another, the cycle repeats.  
在等待的时候，我发现自己只是在观察和思考各种事情。我想着这家酒吧，这家酒店，它们是永远不会真正关闭的地方。一个人的班次结束，另一个人的立即开始，没有一刻是空闲的。我看到大堂里的那家人，他们在等待回家，但半小时后可能会有另一家人到达并办理入住。两周后，那家人可能会离开，被另一家人取代，循环往复。

People will arrive here, they may be families, young couples, those travelling alone or as part of a group. It could be in a taxi or a coach load of tourists but they will arrive. They will stay in hotels like this, they will do what people do, go to museums, eat and drink in the local restaurants, get drunk, shop, make love, and then they'll return to their homes with a host of new memories. I only hope they are happy memories.  
人们会来到这里，可能是家庭、年轻情侣、独自旅行或团体出游的人。可能是在出租车里，或是一车游客，但他们都会到达。他们会住进这样的酒店，他们会做人们常做的事，参观博物馆，在当地餐馆吃喝，喝醉，购物，做爱，然后带着一串新记忆回到家中。我只希望那些是快乐的记忆。

I take another sip of my drink and see Asuka finally enter the bar. She immediately spots me and slowly makes her way towards me. I study her expression as she gets closer, she looks worried about something? No... angry perhaps? It is difficult to tell. I already suspect something bad has happened, Asuka messaging me at such an early hour of the morning is not something I'd expect her to do.  
我又抿了一口饮料，看到明日香终于走进了酒吧。她立刻发现了我，缓缓向我走来。她走近时，我仔细观察她的表情，她看起来有些担忧？不...或许是生气？很难判断。我已经预感到发生了不好的事情，明日香在这么早的清晨给我发消息，这可不是我预期中的行为。

I am worried that this might be my fault. My first thought is that something happened between her and Kaworu. He must have spoken to her about my suggestion earlier and the fool has messed it up! That has to be it. Me and Kodama must have been wrong to put our trust in him to do this. We shouldn't have interfered.  
我担心这可能是我的错。我的第一反应是她和渚之间发生了什么。他一定是和她谈了我之前的建议，而那个傻瓜搞砸了！一定是这样。我和儿玉不该信任他来做这件事。我们不该插手。

"Hey Rei." She sits down on the seat opposite me and lets out a sigh, "Sorry about this, I know it's late but... I needed to speak to you about something."  
“嘿，绫波。”她坐在我对面的座位上，叹了口气，“抱歉这么晚打扰，我知道很晚了但...我需要和你谈些事情。”

"It is fine." I answer her, "Is everything alright?"  
"没事的。" 我回答她，"一切都好吗？"

She nods, "Yes... Well No... I... I don't really know how to say this so I guess I'll just come out with it. It's... Urgh it sounds so stupid to even think about saying it. You're not even going to believe it."  
她点点头，"是的...嗯，不...我...我真的不知道该怎么开口，所以我想我还是直说吧。这...呃，说出来听起来太蠢了。你甚至都不会相信的。"

She looks like she is almost about to laugh as she speaks. I meet her gaze and ask, "What happened? Has Kaworu done something?"  
她说话时看起来几乎要笑出来了。我迎上她的目光，问道："发生了什么？是渚做了什么吗？"

"Kaworu? No! Kaworu hasn't done anything." She looks up at the ceiling for a moment as my confusion grows, if this isn't anything to do with Kaworu then what could it be? Her pause gives me a brief moment to try to think about what it could be but nothing comes to mind, "God! It's... I almost kissed Shinji tonight."  
"渚薰？不！渚薰什么都没做。" 她抬头望向天花板，我的困惑愈发加深，既然这事与渚薰无关，那会是什么呢？她的停顿让我有片刻时间试图思考可能的原因，但脑海中一片空白，"天啊！是...我今晚差点吻了真嗣。"

It takes a moment for my mind to actually process what Asuka has said to me. I was half expecting her to mention she had an argument with Shinji or Misato said something to upset her if this wasn't related to Kaworu. I was in no way prepared for her to say this though. The shock of it causes me to almost spit out the water I'm drinking straight in her direction but I manage to contain myself.  
我的大脑需要片刻来真正处理明日香对我说的话。我本以为她会提到与真嗣或美里发生了争执，如果这与渚薰无关的话。但我完全没有准备好她会说出这样的话。震惊之下，我差点把喝的水直接喷向她，不过我勉强控制住了自己。

"Could you please repeat that?" I ask her, just to make sure that what I thought I heard is in fact what I actually heard.  
"你能再说一遍吗？" 我问她，只是为了确认我听到的确实是事实。

"I... almost kissed Shinji tonight." She repeats it, her face turning red and her eyes lowered towards the table, "I was on the rooftop away from the party for a brief time. He found me and we were talking... I..."  
"我...今晚差点吻了真嗣。" 她重复道，脸颊泛红，目光低垂望向桌面，"我在派对期间短暂地躲到了屋顶上。他找到了我，我们聊了起来...我..."

She trails off and starts looking around the room and fidgeting with her hands. The silence lasts for thirty seconds before I decide to bring her attention back to the conversation, "What happened Asuka?"  
她话音渐弱，开始环顾四周，双手不安地摆弄着。沉默持续了三十秒，我才决定将她的注意力拉回对话中，"发生了什么，明日香？"

She lets out a sigh in annoyance and throws her hands up, "We spoke, we hugged and I don't know... there was a moment... a moment where we looked at each other and... well I don't know if he thought it too but I did... I was close... it could have happened..."  
她懊恼地叹了口气，双手一挥，"我们聊了聊，拥抱了一下，我不知道...有那么一刻...我们彼此对视...嗯，我不知道他是否也这么想，但我确实...我靠得很近...差点就发生了..."

This is not... ideal for what I was hoping would happen between the three of them. On the one hand it does show that there are still strong feelings on the side of Asuka and Shinji, it is proof of that but if they have already ruined that then it ruins the potential for all three of them to be happy. I am certain that the three of them belong together, Kodama is certain as well but we agreed to only try to nudge one of them in that direction. We are not going to interfere in it, we want it to be a natural thing, not forced.  
这并不是...我所期望的他们三人之间会发生的情况。一方面，这确实表明了明日香和真嗣之间依然存在着强烈的感情，这是证明，但如果他们已经破坏了这一点，那么就毁掉了他们三人都能幸福的潜在可能。我确信他们三人应该在一起，Kodama 也确信，但我们同意只尝试在其中一人身上推动这一方向。我们不会干涉，我们希望这是自然而然的事情，而不是被迫的。

Still... maybe I should... maybe I could say something because of what happened. No... I should not for now. Instead my duty is to my friend and making her feel better. I know this will make her feel bad and I understand that completely. I would feel the same if such a thing happened to me. The facts are this though, they nearly kissed but did not. She does not know if Shinji also wanted to kiss her, he likely did but that is not relevant.  
尽管如此...也许我应该...也许我可以因为发生的事情说些什么。不...现在我不应该这么做。相反，我的职责是照顾我的朋友，让她感觉好些。我知道这会让她感觉不好，我完全理解这一点。如果这种事发生在我身上，我也会有同样的感觉。但事实是，他们差点接吻但没有。她不知道真嗣是否也想吻她，他很可能想，但这并不重要。

Asuka has committed no sin, I should remind her of this, I should also find out what I can about this and her and Kaworu.  
明日香没有犯下任何罪行，我应该提醒她这一点，我也应该查明我能了解的关于她和渚薰的事情。

"Does Kaworu know what happened?" I finally ask after taking some time to get my thoughts in order.  
“薰知道发生了什么吗？”我终于在整理好思绪后问道。

She shakes her head, "No, of course he doesn't know. How could I tell him something like that?"  
她摇了摇头，“不，他当然不知道。我怎么能告诉他这种事呢？”

We fall into silence as I try to think of something to say to her. I want to tell her that she has done nothing wrong because, in truth she hasn't actually done anything wrong. She was hit by temptation but she resisted it, that is commendable. I am just unclear of what to say after that, this situation has thrown me, I did not imagine something like this would happen.  
我们陷入了沉默，我试图找些话对她说。我想告诉她她并没有做错什么，事实上她的确没做错什么。她受到了诱惑但抵抗住了，这值得赞扬。我只是不清楚之后该说什么，这种情况让我措手不及，我从未想过会发生这样的事。

"I was right all along, I am a terrible person." I hear her mutter.  
"我一直都是对的，我是个糟糕的人。" 我听到她低声自语。

"No!" I look up at her sternly, "You are not. If you had have kissed him then yes, perhaps you should feel guilt and like you are terrible but you did not. You and Shinji clearly have some feelings for each other and it is not easy to cast them aside, yet you both did not act on those feelings. You both made the right decision."  
"不！" 我严肃地抬头看她，"你不是。如果你当时吻了他，那么或许你应该感到内疚，觉得自己很糟糕，但你没有。你和真嗣显然对彼此都有感情，要摒弃这些感情并不容易，然而你们都没有付诸行动。你们俩都做出了正确的决定。"

She stops to think about my words, I watch as she frowns clearly dealing with some sort of inner conflict. I continue to speak, "You and my brother both need to confront those feelings you have for each other. You need to come up with a solution which is best for the two of you and also for Kaworu. You need to think about what you want. You are in love with and have no desire to leave Kaworu, that is correct?"  
她停下来思考我的话，我看着她皱眉，显然内心正经历着某种冲突。我继续说道，"你和我弟弟都需要正视你们对彼此的感情。你们需要找到一个对你们俩和渚薰都最好的解决方案。你们需要考虑自己想要什么。你爱着渚薰，并且没有离开他的意愿，对吧？"

She nods, "I wouldn't... I couldn't... I love him. I don't care how I feel about Shinji, I would never betray Kaworu like that."  
她点头，“我不会……我不能……我爱他。我不在乎我对真嗣的感觉如何，我绝不会那样背叛薰。”

I nod, "Good. I do not think Shinji would want you to betray Kaworu either. He has his feelings for you but he would not want to hurt another to act on those feelings."  
我点头，“很好。我想真嗣也不希望你背叛薰。他对你的感情是有的，但他不会为了这些感情去伤害别人。”

"I know." Asuka nods before letting out a laugh, "It's funny but... coming here my fear was about Shinji and Kaworu and their feelings for each other. I didn't think... something like this could happen. I thought... I don't know what I thought... Maybe it was a mistake coming here, it's too... complicated."  
“我知道。”明日香点头后笑出声来，“真好笑，但……来这里之前，我担心的是真嗣和薰以及他们对彼此的感情。我没想到……会发生这样的事。我以为……我不知道我以为是什么……也许来这里是个错误，太……复杂了。”

"I do not think so." I answer her, "I think the situation is not quite as complicated as you maybe think it to be. The fact is you and Kaworu are in a relationship, Shinji has unresolved feelings for the two of you and you two have unresolved feelings for him, there are solutions.  
"我不这么认为。" 我回答她，"我觉得情况并没有你想象的那么复杂。事实是，你和渚薰在交往，真嗣对你们两人都有未解的情感，而你们两人对他也有未解的情感，这些都是有解决办法的。

She nods as I wonder if maybe I've said too much. I don't want to push them too much in this idea, me and Kodama agreed, it would only be Kaworu who we would nudge but after tonight's news I can't stay completely silent. I have to do what I can.  
她点头时，我在想自己是不是说得太多了。我不想在这件事上逼他们太紧，我和儿玉已经达成一致，只会暗示渚薰，但在今晚的消息之后，我无法完全保持沉默。我必须尽我所能。

"I know..." She begins to answer, "I just... don't want to hurt Shinji any more than he has been. I know my only answer is to tell him that we should only be friends, we need to put the past behind us but... I know it'll hurt him."  
"我知道..." 她开始回答，"我只是...不想让真嗣再受更多伤害。我知道我唯一的答案是告诉他我们只能做朋友，我们需要把过去抛在脑后，但...我知道这会伤害他。"

It takes all of my being to not reach other, flick her on the forehead and call her an idiot. There is another solution Asuka! I cannot say anymore though, I don't want to influence this too much so instead I nod, "Perhaps... I feel like heartbreak can be avoided though."  
我竭尽全力才忍住不去触碰她，弹她的额头并骂她一声傻瓜。还有别的办法，明日香！但我不能再多说了，我不想过多影响她，于是我点点头，“或许……我觉得心碎是可以避免的。”

"Maybe..." She nods before letting out a yawn and smiling, "I... Thank you Rei. I think I... know what to do now."  
“也许吧……”她点点头，打了个哈欠，微笑道，“我……谢谢你，绫波。我想我……知道该怎么做了。”

### Chapter 25: Mother

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I nod my head at the drive to confirm I'm ready and the car begins to pull away from the hotel slowly. I feel the familiar tingling of butterflies in my stomach as we round the first corner and begin the journey. The seat next to me is unusually empty, Kaworu isn't going to be joining me on this journey. Instead he'll be meeting up with Shinji and his friends to get to know them some more.  
我点头确认准备好了，车子便缓缓驶离酒店。当我们绕过第一个弯道，开始这段旅程时，我感到熟悉的胃里蝴蝶飞舞的感觉。旁边的座位异常空荡，渚薰不会在这趟旅途中陪伴我。相反，他会与真嗣和他的朋友们会合，进一步了解他们。

It feels strange, Kaworu not being here, I'm so used to his presence. I'm so used to turning myself and seeing his face there, either deep in thought, worrying about something or just smiling at me like there is nothing wrong in the world. I'm so used to seeing the look in his eyes that tells me he loves me, and I'm so used to reaching out and holding his hand. It feels wrong him not being here.  
感觉很奇怪，渚薰不在这里，我太习惯他的存在了。我太习惯转身就能看到他的脸，或是深思熟虑，或是担忧着什么，或是像世界上没有任何问题一样对我微笑。我太习惯从他的眼神中看到他爱我的信息，也太习惯伸出手去握住他的手。他不在，感觉不对劲。

Also, quite strange is the lack of security following me today. I suppose they don't expect anything from me so I only have a small detail nearby. Kaworu on the other hand will have more people following him. It's actually something of a miracle we were able to do this today, I don't think they wanted us to have any days where we weren't together. I suppose I have Misato to thank for this being allowed.  
此外，今天跟随我的安保人员出奇地少，颇为奇怪。我想他们并不期待我会有什么举动，所以只安排了少量人员在附近。而另一方面，碇真嗣身边会有更多人跟随。实际上，我们今天能这样做简直是个奇迹，我不认为他们希望我们有任何分开的日子。我想我得感谢美里，是她让这一切得以实现。

I didn't want to do this with him there though. It isn't something that concerns him, its something I have to do on my own. I'm on my way to meet Hikari, the girl who was my best friend for those brief few months I spent in Japan the first go around.  
不过，我并不想在他也在场的情况下这样做。这件事与他无关，是我必须独自面对的。我正前往与光见面，她是我在第一次短暂停留日本期间最好的朋友。

As the butterflies in my stomach indicate I'm feeling anxious about it. This will be the first time I've seen her properly since those days. Sure, I saw her on my birthday but that was hardly a proper meeting. It wasn't arranged, we didn't get the chance to talk properly and it was in a very public place. This is an opportunity for us to catch up properly, for us to sit down and talk and for me to... apologize, I guess.  
正如我胃里的蝴蝶所表明的那样，我对这次见面感到焦虑。这将是我自那段日子以来第一次正式见到她。当然，我在生日那天见过她，但那根本算不上正式的会面。那次并非事先安排，我们没有机会好好交谈，而且是在一个非常公共的场合。这次是我们好好叙旧的机会，坐下来交谈，而我也可以……道歉，我想。

God, how I hate that word. How I hate having to apologize to people. I hate it because all it does is bring up the memories of that person I used to be. It forces me to repeat those scenes in my head, the yelling, the shouting, the taunting and the nastiness. It also forces my mind to revert for a moment, to yell at me and tell me how weak and pathetic I am for going against what I promised I would be.  
天啊，我多么讨厌那个词。我多么讨厌不得不向人们道歉。我讨厌它，因为它只会唤起我过去那个人的记忆。它迫使我一遍遍地在脑海中重现那些场景，那些叫喊、咆哮、嘲讽和恶意。它还迫使我的思维暂时倒退，对我大喊大叫，告诉我违背自己承诺的我有多么软弱和可悲。

_Apologize? What for, she should have been honored to be associated with someone like you. Someone as beautiful and talented. They all should have been. What do you have to apologize for?  
道歉？为了什么，她本应因与你这样的人——如此美丽和才华横溢的人——有所关联而感到荣幸。他们所有人都应该如此。你有什么好道歉的呢？_

I try to talk myself through those thoughts. I know what I have to apologize for and why I have to do it. I know why my behaviour was wrong and I know the cause of it. I know why my mind is going to this, I know why that defense mechanism is in play. I know who I am, I know what I was and I know who I could be.  
我试图用这些想法说服自己。我知道我为什么要道歉，以及为什么要这么做。我知道我的行为为何是错误的，也知道其根源所在。我知道为什么我的思维会回到这些事情上，知道为什么这种防御机制在起作用。我知道我是谁，我知道我曾经是什么样的人，也知道我可能成为什么样的人。

Problem is, I don't really know who Hikari is now. Sure, I saw her the other day but it didn't give me a good idea of anything. I honestly don't know how today is going to go. When I left Japan, I wasn't in a good place. When I left Japan, I did it without telling anything, not even her. In fact, in the months leading up to me leaving I don't think I spoke to her more than a handful of times, even then I don't think I was especially pleasant to her.  
问题是，我现在真的不知道光是什么样的人了。当然，前几天我见过她，但那并没有让我对她有任何深入的了解。老实说，我不知道今天会怎么样。当我离开日本时，我的状态并不好。离开日本时，我什么也没告诉她，甚至没有告诉她。事实上，在我离开前的几个月里，我想我和她说话的次数不超过几次，即便如此，我也不觉得我对她有多友好。

I would mostly avoid her and the others where I was able to. I couldn't avoid Rei and Shinji of course but it was easy to avoid Hikari and Shinji's friends. I could just hide in my room when they came over or I could pretend I wasn't feeling well so I didn't have to go out. I think I spoke to her a handful of times, and gave very little in the way of conversation.  
我大多时候尽可能避开她和别人。当然，我无法避开丽和真嗣，但要避开光和真嗣的朋友们却很容易。他们来的时候我可以躲在房间里，或者假装身体不舒服，这样就不用出去了。我想我和她说过几次话，但交流的内容非常少。

It's not like I was very good before Third Impact either. I took her friendship entirely for granted. Used her for my own gain, to allow myself to be noticed. That's all people were to me, accessories so that I could be noticed and praised. Deep down... I wanted to tell people what they meant to me, I wanted to let them know I needed them but I never could tell them... I don't think I could now either.  
其实第三次冲击前我也不怎么样。我完全把她的友谊视为理所当然。利用她来达到自己的目的，让自己被人注意到。对我来说，人们不过是配件，让我能被人注意和赞扬的工具。内心深处……我想告诉人们他们对我意味着什么，我想让他们知道我需要他们，但我从未能告诉他们……我想我现在也做不到。

I can remember other things as well. I can remember the week or so I stayed at her place. I had run away from Misato's after seeing my sync rate drop rapidly, after I had been beaten numerous times, after my mind had been violated by that Angel and I had had one too many arguments with Shinji. I remember doing nothing but sitting in front of a television screen, absent mindedly playing her games consoles all day. I said little, I did little, I barely even ate.  
我还能记得其他事情。我记得在她那里住了一个星期左右。从美里那里逃出来后，看到同步率急剧下降，被多次殴打，心灵被那个使徒侵犯，还和真嗣吵了很多次。我记得整天只是坐在电视机前，心不在焉地玩她的游戏机。我说得很少，做得很少，几乎没怎么吃东西。

I remember one night breaking down in front of her, sobbing my heart out and then the next day I left. That's something I'm good at, leaving. I'm good at running away, from people and from myself.  
我记得有一天晚上在她面前崩溃了，痛哭流涕，第二天就离开了。这是我擅长的，离开。我擅长逃避，逃避别人，也逃避自己。

I suppose I'm lucky, very lucky.  
我想我是幸运的，非常幸运。

I've been given a big second chance, one more chance than I think I deserve. It's been so difficult for me to shake off the image of who I was. I always hear the things I said, I always remember the thoughts I had and I always see the way I acted and it just leaves this awful taste in my mouth.  
我得到了一个巨大的第二次机会，我认为自己不配得到的机会。摆脱过去的自我形象对我来说一直很困难。我总是听到我说过的话，我总是记得我的想法，我总是看到我的行为方式，这让我感到非常难受。

I hear the driver call to me that we'll be arriving at the café in just five minutes. My thoughts shift quickly from my upcoming meeting with Hikari to what happened between me and Shinji last night. I had a restless night's sleep, worried that if I were to fall asleep, I'd probably end up dreaming about it. I felt this knot in my stomach all morning when speaking to Kaworu. I was on the verge of telling him numerous times.  
司机告诉我，我们将在五分钟内到达咖啡馆。我的思绪迅速从即将与光见面的会议转移到昨晚我和真嗣之间发生的事情上。昨晚我睡得很不安稳，担心如果睡着了，可能会梦到那件事。早上和薰说话时，我感到胃里一直有个结。有好几次我都差点告诉他。

I don't really know what I would say to him just yet though. I don't want to hurt him over something that didn't actually happen. I also don't think it'd be too fair on Shinji to tell Kaworu without him knowing or having a say in it too.  
我还不确定该对他说些什么。我不想因为一件实际上并未发生的事情伤害他。我也不认为在真嗣不知情或没有发言权的情况下告诉薰是公平的。

I knew that this trip would not go without some complications. I knew that it would be strange for all three of us but I was hoping the strangeness would just rear its head in the form of awkward silences, perhaps the odd comment or minor argument. I didn't expect to nearly kiss Shinji.  
我知道这次旅行不会一帆风顺。我知道我们三个人在一起会很奇怪，但我希望这种奇怪只表现为尴尬的沉默，或许偶尔的评论或小争执。我没想到会差点吻了真嗣。

For the remaining for minutes of the journey I remain lost in thought. I go over the conversation with Shinji. I go over what happened when I last saw Hikari. I think about what I might say to her today. Do I apologize for who I was? For what I was? I wonder if Hikari even knows a thing about my past? Do I explain it all to her?  
在剩下的几分钟旅程中，我陷入了沉思。我反复回想与真嗣的对话。我回想起上次见到光时发生的事情。我在想今天该对她说些什么。我是否应该为过去的自己道歉？为我曾经的样子？我不知道光是否了解我的过去？我是否应该向她解释一切？

I guess I'll have to. I guess it's time for Asuka the writer to tell her story.  
看来我不得不这样了。是时候让作家明日香来讲述她的故事了。

I feel the car slow down and eventually come to a stop, as it does the knot in my stomach tightens. God, I hate feeling nervous like this. I feel just like I did before I used to launch in Unit 02. I hated that feeling then and I hate it now. At least I don't have to contend with being launched upwards at a ridiculous speed anymore. At least when I get out of this car it'll be a friend I see and not a hideous abomination hellbent on destroying everything I know.  
我感觉车子减速，最终停了下来，与此同时，我胃里的结也越拧越紧。天啊，我讨厌这样紧张的感觉。我感觉就像以前驾驶二号机发射前一样。那时候我讨厌这种感觉，现在也一样。至少我不再需要应对以荒谬速度向上发射的情况了。至少当我走出这辆车时，看到的会是一个朋友，而不是一个一心要毁灭我所知一切的丑陋怪物。

Still I can hear that voice in my mind trying to drag me down for feeling nervous, just as it did back then. Telling me how weak I am for feeling this way. How I had no reason to be nervous, how I shouldn't be nervous.  
尽管如此，我仍能听到那个声音在我脑海中试图拖我下水，就像那时一样，因为我感到紧张。它告诉我，我因为这样感到软弱。我没有任何理由紧张，我不应该紧张。

"We're here." I hear the driver announce to me through the gap. I thank him and reach forward slipping him a few notes from my purse. He looks at me, somewhat surprised and confused by my attempt to tip him.  
"我们到了。" 司机透过缝隙向我宣布。我向他道谢，并从钱包里抽出几张钞票递给他。他看着我，有些惊讶和困惑，因为我试图给他小费。

"Take it." I tell him and look to see a photo on his dashboard of him and a family, "Treat your kid."  
"收下吧。" 我告诉他，目光落在他仪表盘上的一张他和家人的照片上，"给你的孩子买点东西。"

He takes the money and thanks me and I finally get out of the car. No turning back now. I'm barely out of the car before I hear the voice calling me.  
他接过钱并感谢我，我终于下了车。现在没有回头路了。我刚下车，就听到那声音在叫我。

"ASUKA!" “明日香！”

My head turns towards the source of the sound and I see Hikari stood outside of the café grinning at me. I shoot her a smile back and adjust my skirt before calling back, "Hikari!"  
我的头转向声音的来源，看到光站在咖啡馆外，对着我咧嘴笑。我回以微笑，调整了一下裙子，然后喊道：“光！”

I make my way towards her and she immediately pulls me into a hug. I hug her back and she releases me and takes a look at the car I just arrived in, "Wow, you travel in style, don't you?"  
我向她走去，她立刻把我拉进一个拥抱。我回抱她，她松开我，看了看我刚到的车，“哇，你出行真讲究，不是吗？”

"Well you know... I guess when you're as important as I am you have to travel like this. I mean, not only am I one of the saviours of mankind but I'm also a highly regarded author." I grin and boast back at her. I cringe inwardly at my own words as they leave my mouth, so much for the new humble Asuka. I just hope she knows I'm not being totally serious when I boast.  
“嗯，你知道的……我想当你像我这么重要时，就得这样出行。我的意思是，我不仅是人类的救星之一，还是一位备受推崇的作家。”我笑着向她炫耀。话一出口，我内心就感到一阵尴尬，新生的谦逊明日香就这么没了。我只希望她知道我在炫耀时并没有完全当真。

"A... published author? You?" She blinks at me in surprise.  
"一位...已出版的作者？你？" 她惊讶地眨眼看着我。

I nod, "Yes! What are you surprised at?"  
我点头，"是的！你惊讶什么？"

"Nothing I just... didn't expect that from you! Wow, we have so much to talk about it seems." She answers and I follow her into the café. We take a moment to look around for a suitable seat before picking one near to the window.  
"没什么，只是...没想到你会是！哇，看来我们有很多要聊的。" 她回答道，我跟着她走进咖啡馆。我们花了一会儿时间寻找合适的座位，最后选了一个靠近窗户的位置。

The knot in my stomach tightens as the reality of the situation fully sets in. I'm now set opposite one of my best friends, one of... my only friends after so many years of not seeing her. A friend... it's still a bit of a foreign word and concept to me. Hikari was really the first friend I ever had.  
胃里的结紧了，当现实完全袭来时。我现在正坐在我最好的朋友之一对面，在这么多年没见之后，她是我...唯一的朋友之一。朋友...这个词和概念对我来说仍然有些陌生。光真的是我第一个朋友。

I had a very lonely childhood, that was of my own making. The younger Asuka Langley Soryu didn't need friends. She would push people away, at first it would be a gentle attempt to do so. A no thank you would generally suffice followed by turning away. Sometimes it would be a bit more forceful, calling the other person stupid, making them cry... the usual.  
我的童年非常孤独，这是我自己的选择。年幼的惣流·明日香·兰格雷不需要朋友。她会推开别人，起初是温和的尝试。一个不用了谢谢通常就足够了，然后转身离开。有时会更用力些，骂对方愚蠢，让他们哭...这是常有的事。

I didn't need friends. I didn't need a childhood. I didn't want to be seen or treated like a kid. All I needed was myself and I didn't want to deal with all that petty stuff.  
我不需要朋友。我不需要童年。我不希望被看作或对待成孩子。我只需要我自己，我不想处理那些琐碎的事情。

This changed when I got to Tokyo-3, suddenly I had friends and I found it hard to push them away. Of course, me being me, I had to twist it. I didn't have friends because I wanted them, I didn't have friends because deep down I was fucking lonely. No... I had friends because it was convenient to do so. I had friends because I could use them to put the attention on me.  
这一变化发生在我到达第三新东京市时，突然间我有了朋友，却发现很难将他们推开。当然，我就是这样的人，我得把它扭曲一下。我交朋友不是因为我想要他们，我交朋友是因为我内心深处他妈的孤独。不...我交朋友是因为这样做很方便。我交朋友是因为我可以利用他们把注意力集中在我身上。

"How are you? It's been... a long time, last time we saw each other it was..." Hikari suddenly tails off as she likely remembers the last time we saw one another and probably after seeing the discomfort on my face, "...sorry."  
"你还好吗？已经...很久没见了，上次我们见面时..."光突然停了下来，她可能想起了我们最后一次见面的情景，也许看到我脸上的不适，"...对不起。"

"Was that the time I told you and the others to go away whilst in a fit of rage?" I ask her calmly, "Or do you mean the time before that, when I ran away from your fathers in Tokyo-3?"  
"那次是我在一阵狂怒中叫你和其他人离开的时候吗？"我平静地问她，"还是指之前那次，我在第三新东京市逃离你父亲们的时候？"

She lowers her eyes to the table, "Sorry I... You probably want to put all of that behind you, don't you?"  
她垂下眼帘，望向桌面，“对不起，我……你可能想把这一切都抛在脑后，对吗？”

"No, don't be sorry." I shake my head, "You're right. I do want to put it all behind me but... Over the last few years that's all I've been doing. Trying to put things behind me and all it's done is made things worth. I had to talk about it and I have to apologize. Just so you know... I do hate apologizing."  
“不，别道歉。”我摇摇头，“你说得对。我确实想把这一切都抛诸脑后，但……过去几年里，我所做的就是试图把事情抛在脑后，结果却让事情变得更糟。我必须谈谈这些，也必须道歉。只是让你知道……我真的很讨厌道歉。”

She smirks, "Well... I never once heard you do such a thing in the months I went to school with you."  
她微微一笑，“嗯……我在学校和你同班的那些日子里，可从来没听你这么做过。”

I shrug and give a half smile back at her, "Well... I never had anything to apologize for, did I? It was always Shinji's fault, or whoever was the target of my ire deserved it, or... you know how it is. You know what I was. You even tried to call me out on it a few times but you never got through."  
我耸耸肩，对她回以半笑，“嗯...我从未有什么需要道歉的，不是吗？总是真嗣的错，或是谁惹我生气就该受着，或者...你知道的。你了解我以前是什么样。你甚至几次试图指出来，但从未成功。”

The smile fades from my face as the guilt of my past comes to the surface again. I've been over those moments far too many times. I've tried to justify my actions but the truth is, as I and Hikari know, there is no excuse.  
笑容从我脸上消失，过去的罪恶感再次浮现。那些时刻我已反复回想过太多次。我试图为自己的行为辩解，但事实是，正如我和光知道的那样，没有任何借口。

I look over at Hikari who seems a little bit taken aback by my words. I don't think she was quite expecting me to respond in such a way. I don't think she realized that I have and am trying to make an effort to change. She reaches out and grabs my hand, "It's okay Asuka."  
我看向光，她似乎被我的话稍稍震惊。我想她没料到我会这样回应。她可能没意识到我已经在努力改变。她伸出手握住我的手，“没关系的，明日香。”

"I can't justify a single part of it Hikari... and believe me I have tried." I shrug again, "I'm sorry for it... I truly am, I was a... an incredibly fucked up person back then. I wasn't just a silly foreign girl who had issues adjusting to a new mysterious country. I wasn't just some girl with a superiority complex, I was... fucked up. I was a scared little girl who hid her fear behind anger and a lot of pride."  
"我无法为其中的任何一部分辩解，光……相信我，我试过了。" 我再次耸肩，"为此我感到抱歉……真的，那时候的我……是一个极度扭曲的人。我不仅仅是一个适应不了新奇国家的傻乎乎的外国女孩。我不仅仅是一个自命不凡的女孩，我……很扭曲。我是一个害怕的小女孩，把恐惧藏在愤怒和大量自尊背后。"

"Asuka..." Hikari's voice is barely above a whisper as her hand tightens around my own, "You could have spoken to me at any time."  
"明日香……" 光的声音几乎低不可闻，她的手紧紧握住我的，"你本可以随时和我说的。"

"I know." I nod, "I know that, and I could have spoken to a number of people. Misato... Shinji... Therapists... but I couldn't do that. You have to understand that from a young age I turned my back on other people. I stopped relying on anyone but myself. I saw relying on other people as making me weak. So, I couldn't confide or be helped by anyone be it family, friends or professional."  
"我知道。" 我点头，"我知道这一点，我本可以和很多人说的。美里……真嗣……心理医生……但我做不到。你必须理解，从很小的时候起，我就对其他人关上了心门。我停止依赖任何人，只靠自己。我认为依赖他人会让我变得软弱。所以，我无法向任何人倾诉或寻求帮助，无论是家人、朋友还是专业人士。"

I take a deep breath and ready myself for the next part of the discussion. Talking to her about mama and the various things I witnessed. Talking to her about my childhood. It's fine, I've done this before with Rei and Kaworu... I can do it again.  
我深吸一口气，准备迎接讨论的下一部分。和她谈起妈妈以及我目睹的种种事情。谈起我的童年。没关系，我以前和丽和薰都谈过...我可以再做一次。

I have to wonder what she knows already, does she know anything? She shifts uncomfortably in her seat for a moment before looking me in the eyes, "Is it... related to your mother?"  
我不禁好奇她已经知道了什么，她知道些什么吗？她不安地在座位上动了动，然后直视我的眼睛，“这...和你的母亲有关吗？”

I nod my head, "Yes, how did you know?"  
我点点头，“是的，你怎么知道的？”

"It was a guess... I suppose I kind figured something was up when you stayed at my place. You called for her in your sleep, every night you were there." She answers me and I feel myself cringe at how I must have seemed back then, "I kinda guessed but I couldn't find the nerve to mention it. I meant to bring it up later but again...I was scared to do so. When I heard that I thought that must be it though, you weren't alone Asuka. All of us... we all lost our mothers when we were young."  
"那只是一个猜测……我想我大概在你留宿我家时察觉到了什么。你每晚都在睡梦中呼唤她。" 她回答我，我感到自己因那时可能表现出的样子而畏缩，"我有点猜到了，但没勇气提起。本打算晚点再说，但又害怕这么做。当我听到那些时，我想那一定是真的，你并不孤单，明日香。我们所有人……我们都在年幼时失去了母亲。"

"When did you lose yours?" I ask her.  
"你是什么时候失去她的？" 我问她。

"When I was very young." She begins to answer, "Dad said it was an accident at the lab. A freak fire broke out and she was killed in it. It was probably far too much information for a child but we were told the body was scarred beyond recognition. I later found out that was a lie, the body that he saw... that we buried wasn't hers. It was someone else killed in a fire... she was..."  
"我很小的时候。" 她开始回答，"爸爸说是在实验室的一次意外。一场突如其来的火灾爆发，她在其中丧生。对一个孩子来说，这信息可能太过沉重，但我们被告知遗体已无法辨认。后来我才知道那是谎言，他看到的那具……我们埋葬的遗体不是她的。那是另一位在火灾中丧生的人……她……"

"Kills and absorbed into a spare core... in case you were needed?" I finish her sentence for her and frown as I watch her nod silently. Maybe it should have dawned on me earlier but I'm only just realizing now how dark my classes situation was. An entire classroom full of kids whose mothers had been taken away from them.  
"被杀害并吸收进备用核心...以防你需要被召唤？" 我替她补全了句子，皱着眉看她默默点头。也许我早该意识到，但现在我才真正明白我的班级情况有多黑暗。一个教室里全是孩子，他们的母亲都被夺走了。

If there was ever proof needed of how evil SEELE was this is it. Mothers taken from children to be used as spare parts for those monsters we piloted. It's almost too much to comprehend.  
如果有必要证明 SEELE 有多邪恶，这就是证据。母亲们被从孩子身边夺走，成为我们驾驶的那些怪物的备用零件。这几乎让人难以置信。

"I didn't even know I was a candidate whilst I was in school. I was only told after Third Impact when they started to reveal some of the truth of it all." She speaks, "I just... our entire class... we all knew we had that in common but because of how horriffic Second Impact was and the state of the world I guess we never connected the dots."  
"我在学校时甚至不知道自己是候选人。直到第三次冲击后，他们开始揭露一些真相时我才被告知。" 她说话了，"我只是...我们整个班级...我们都知道我们有这个共同点，但由于第二次冲击的恐怖和世界的状况，我想我们从未将这些线索联系起来。"

"I had no idea... I guess I never asked." I reply, "I assumed most people had both parents... I didn't know it was everyone."  
"我完全不知道...我想我从没问过。" 我回答，"我以为大多数人都有双亲...我不知道这是普遍情况。"

"Part of the reason I'm the way I am... the way I was... being the class rep, the honour student and all that stuff is because of losing her. My dad tried to raise us as best he could but he had to work all of the time to support three growing girls." Hikari begins to explain, "Kodama was the oldest of us, I guess it should have been her but she just couldn't get the hang of it and Nozomi was too young, we tried to shield her from any pain. It fell to me to be the one to do it. I was the one who cooked, cleaned and had the responsibility. I was the one who became the mother and it affected me."  
"我之所以成为现在的我...或者说过去的我...作为班级代表，优等生等等，部分原因就是因为失去了她。我爸爸尽力把我们三个孩子抚养得最好，但他必须全天工作来支持我们三个成长中的女孩。" 光开始解释，"小玉是我们中最大的，我想本该是她承担这一切，但她就是无法适应，而望美还太小，我们试图保护她不受任何痛苦。责任落到了我身上。我是那个做饭、打扫并承担责任的人。我是那个成为母亲角色的人，这影响了我。"

"It must have been tough."  
"那一定很艰难。"

"Sometimes on an evening I'd look at myself in the mirror, see how serious I was... how uptight I was, think about how bossy I could be and all this responsible and want to break down crying but I couldn't. I had to be strong for those two and for father. Inside though... I just wanted to scream and tell it and everyone to fuck off!"  
"有时在晚上，我会对着镜子看自己有多严肃...多紧绷，想到自己能有多霸道，还有这一切的责任感，真想崩溃大哭，但我不能。我得为那两个人和父亲坚强。可内心深处...我只想尖叫，告诉这一切和所有人滚蛋！"

"Hikari!" my eyes widen in surprise at hearing her choice of words.  
"光！" 听到她选的词，我的眼睛惊讶地睁大了。"

"I was the mother at home, the class rep in school, the straight A student. I hated it at times, I was friendless and had no outlets. I was sure most people hated me as well. One day you came into my life and you were... my first real friend. You didn't care who I was, you just saw beyond it."  
"我在家里是母亲，在学校是班长，成绩全 A 的学生。有时候我讨厌这样，我没有朋友，也没有发泄的出口。我确信大多数人也讨厌我。有一天你走进了我的生活，你成了...我的第一个真正的朋友。你不在乎我是谁，你只是看透了这一切。"

I wish I could feel something good about her words but the truth is that the reason I became friends with her back then is because I saw her status. It was just the old Asuka trying to get herself noticed and latching on for her own gain.  
我本希望她的这番话能让我感到些许欣慰，但事实是，我当初与她成为朋友，只是因为我看到了她的状态。那不过是旧时的明日香试图引起注意，为了自己的利益而攀附罢了。

Hikari smiles at me, "I know what you're thinking and don't worry... maybe you did use me at first but... is that really the truth of it? Is that really what you saw our friendship as?"  
光对我微笑着，"我知道你在想什么，别担心……也许你一开始是利用了我，但……那真的是真相吗？你真的把我们的友谊看作那样吗？"

I take a few moments and shake my head, "No... I guess it isn't. I... had no idea you were going through all that as well. I... Shinji as well and I suppose all the others. We're all victims."  
我沉默片刻，摇了摇头，"不……我想不是的。我……我不知道你也经历了那么多。我……还有真嗣，以及我想其他人也一样。我们都是受害者。"

"What about you? What happened?"  
“那你呢？发生了什么？”

"Well..." I prepare myself to tell her about my mother, "You're right... for me it started with my mother. I was barely four years old when it happened. She was working on some big project... and there was an accidently. Same as your mother... same as Shinjis and I suppose the same as the others. Only with mine... they found a body and my mother didn't die... not for a while anyway..."  
“嗯……”我准备好告诉她关于我母亲的事，“你说得对……对我来说，一切始于我母亲。那时我才四岁左右。她在做一个大项目……结果发生了意外。和你母亲一样……和 Shinjis 一样，我想其他人也是如此。只是对我来说……他们找到了一具尸体，而我母亲并没有立即死去……不管怎样，她撑了一段时间……”

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

I lean on the barrier and watch the people on the frozen rink ahead of me for a few moments. I see the various groups of people skating around, most of them enjoying themselves. I see young children pushing large animal shaped objects for support, parents close behind them. I see couples in love holding hands and smiling at each other. I see a few people spinning in place and trying their hand at various tricks and I see others who are just content to skate around in circles and enjoy their time here.  
我靠在栏杆上，注视着前方冰冻的溜冰场上的人们。我看到各种各样的人群在滑冰，大多数人都在享受着乐趣。我看到年幼的孩子们推着大型动物形状的支撑物，父母紧随其后。我看到相爱的情侣手牵手，彼此微笑。我看到一些人原地旋转，尝试各种花样，还有一些人只是满足于绕着圈子滑冰，享受这里的时光。

A big part of me wants to try it out for myself but there is an equally big part of me that is terrified of the prospect. Outside of basic pilot training for the Eva I was never made to do or even allowed to do any sort of physical activity. I never played any sports, I never swam, I never ran... I didn't do... well anything really. My angelic body back then kept my form in good physical condition, I was an entity that didn't really need to ingest food or exercise for my wellbeing so never required exercise.  
我内心有很大一部分渴望亲自尝试，但同样也有一大块区域对此感到恐惧。除了 Eva 的基本驾驶训练外，我从未被要求或允许参与任何形式的体育活动。我从未参加过任何运动，从未游过泳，从未跑过步……我几乎什么都没做过。那时，我天使般的身体保持了良好的体形，我不需要摄入食物或锻炼来维持健康，所以从未需要过运动。

Now I have more to contend with, I have to be concerned with what I eat and drink, I do some slight exercise, I do tire and I can be hurt. I can see the scene now, I step onto the ice and five minutes later I'm carried off of it, my arm in a sling.  
现在我有了更多需要面对的事情，我必须关心自己的饮食，进行一些轻微的锻炼，我会感到疲惫，也会受伤。我现在仿佛能看到那一幕，我踏上冰面，五分钟后就被抬了下来，手臂打着石膏。

Still... despite the risk and worry, I really want to try it. Perhaps at a later time I can bring Asuka or maybe... if things do manage to work themselves out, I can bring Asuka and Shinji. Yes! I think that is what I will do, I will figure this out and bring the two of them.  
尽管如此……尽管有风险和担忧，我真的很想尝试。也许以后我可以带明日香来，或者……如果一切顺利的话，我可以带明日香和真嗣。是的！我想这就是我要做的，我会解决这个问题，然后带他们两个一起来。

"Nagisa." “渚。”

A soft voice snaps me away from my thoughts of the three of us holding each other's hands and skating around the ice. I turn to see Rei stood behind me, her red eyes locked onto mine. I smile at her, "Rei, thank you so much for coming."  
一个轻柔的声音将我从我们三人手牵手在冰上滑行的幻想中拉回现实。我转身看到丽站在我身后，她红色的眼睛紧盯着我。我向她微笑，“丽，非常感谢你能来。”

"It is no problem." She answers me before making her way to the barrier, "I had assumed you would probably have questions or things you wanted to say to me after our discussion yesterday, so I made sure to keep my schedule free."  
“没什么。”她回答我，然后走向围栏，“我猜你昨天和我们讨论后可能会有问题或想对我说的话，所以我特意空出了时间。”

"Thank you, I... really appreciate that." I nod back at her and take a look at the crowds of people around us. This probably isn't the best place for a discussion of this nature, "Should we go elsewhere? I saw a café as I came in. I will buy us some tea?"  
"谢谢你，我……真的很感激。" 我向她点头回应，环顾四周拥挤的人群。这里可能不是讨论这种话题的最佳地点，"我们应该换个地方吗？我进来时看到了一家咖啡馆。我请我们喝点茶怎么样？"

She nods, "That would be nice, thank you."  
她点头道："那太好了，谢谢你。"

We turn and make our way back through the crowds and towards the small café. I realized that if I was going to be serious about this thing between myself, Asuka and Shinji I should probably speak to Rei some more regarding the subject. I didn't want to rush into anything but I also realized I am on something of a tight timeline, me and Asuka will not be in Japan forever and then I might have missed my chance, we all might have... missed our chance.  
我们转身穿过人群，朝那家小咖啡馆走去。我意识到，如果我要认真对待自己和明日香、真嗣之间的关系，我可能应该就这个话题多和绫波谈谈。我不想仓促行事，但也意识到我的时间有点紧迫，我和明日香不会永远留在日本，那时我可能就错过了机会，我们所有人都可能……错过了机会。

We arrive at the café and go inside, I order us a small pot of tea and we take up a seat in one of the quiet corners of the room. Rei starts to pour herself some tea from the pot and looks at me, "You have not spoken to Asuka regarding our discussion last night yet, have you?"  
我们到达咖啡馆并走了进去，我为我们点了一小壶茶，然后找了个安静的角落坐下。丽开始从茶壶里给自己倒茶，并看着我，"你还没和明日香谈起我们昨晚的讨论，对吧？"

I shake my head, "No... Not yet. That's... what I wanted to speak to you about really. I've been thinking a lot about what you told me. Thinking about how I feel for the two of them and how they might feel for me and each other."  
我摇了摇头，"没有...还没。那...就是我想和你谈的事情。我一直在思考你告诉我的那些话。思考我对她们两人的感觉，以及她们可能对我和彼此的感觉。"

"Good." She nods, "Despite my feelings towards it, it would not be wise for you to have rushed into anything. What conclusions have you come to?"  
"很好。"她点头道，"尽管我对这件事有我的感受，但你贸然行事并不明智。你得出了什么结论？"

"You're right... I love the both of them and I think it is also true that they have feelings for each other and for me as well. I still have some reservations though, I guess... I do not see myself as fit for the both of them. I guess I feel that perhaps the two of them would be better off without me."  
"你说得对...我爱他们两个，而且我认为他们也确实对彼此和我都有感情。不过，我还是有些疑虑，我想...我觉得自己配不上他们俩。我总觉得，或许没有我，他们俩会过得更好。"

"I am sure given who the two of them are, they will also, quite irritatingly, share those feelings as well. I am sure Asuka probably feels you and Shinji would be better off together and I am certain Shinji feels you and Asuka and better off together."  
"我敢肯定，考虑到他们俩的性格，他们也会很烦人地分享这些感情。我确信明日香可能觉得你和真嗣在一起会更好，而我也确信真嗣觉得你和明日香在一起会更好。"

"I... That is true." I shrug and give an embarrassed smile, "In that respect we are all the same and, in that way, we are all made for one another."  
"我...确实如此。"我耸耸肩，尴尬地笑了笑，"在这方面，我们都是一样的，正因为这样，我们才注定要在一起。"

"I feel that is obvious to everyone except for yourselves." She smiles at me, "You only need to look at the three of you together for a few minutes to see how right it looks."  
“我觉得这对除了你们自己之外的每个人都是显而易见的。”她对我微笑，“你只需要看你们三个人在一起几分钟，就能看出那看起来多么合适。”

I feel my heart flutter a little bit at her words, "Do you really think so?"  
听到她的话，我感到心跳微微加速，“你真的这么认为吗？”

She nods her head again, "Yes, although I do appreciate that it is probably not a normal thing people would consider."  
她再次点头，“是的，尽管我理解这可能不是人们通常会考虑的事情。”

"I know... that's what I'm struggling with. I... feel it's right but I don't really know what to do. I love Asuka so much and I don't want to do anything that might risk damaging what we have. I couldn't live with myself if I upset her." I answer, "But I know for certain how she feels regarding Shinji and I know how I feel about Shinji. We both love him and he... if you say he loves us then I believe that to be true. I just don't know how to progress... humans are... they are complicated."  
"我知道...这也是我纠结的地方。我...觉得这是对的，但我真的不知道该怎么做。我深爱着明日香，我不想做任何可能破坏我们关系的事情。如果我让她伤心，我无法原谅自己。" 我回答道，"但我知道她对真嗣的感情，也知道我对真嗣的感情。我们都爱他，而他...如果你说他爱我们，我相信这是真的。我只是不知道如何继续...人类是...他们很复杂。"

"You are human, you are a part of that complexity."  
"你也是人类，你也是那种复杂性的一部分。"

"I wasn't always human... and neither were you Rei. The two of us have memories and thoughts that don't belong to us, that belong to beings long since left this reality. Beings for whom love has no boundaries because of what they were to become." I shake my head, "We also bear the burden of those who raised us and what we were."  
"我并非一直都是人类...你也不是，绫波。我们俩都有着不属于我们的记忆和思想，那些属于早已离开这个现实的存在的记忆。那些存在因为他们的未来而没有爱的界限。" 我摇了摇头，"我们也承载着那些抚养我们的人和我们曾经的负担。"

"True, but you are human now and you are among humans. If you can deal with this situation then so can they, regardless of your origins." She sips from her tea, "I admit, I am unsure myself how to approach such a thing. I am aware that Asuka and Shinji are unlike us, they have not seen love in the same way, they have seen it weighted down by the society they were brought up in. Yet, I have faith that they can see past that societal baggage and see that love is... love."  
“确实，但你现在是人类，身处人类之中。如果你能应对这种情况，那么他们也能，不论你的出身如何。”她啜了一口茶，“我承认，我自己也不确定该如何处理这样的事情。我知道明日香和真嗣与我们不同，他们未曾以同样的方式见证过爱情，他们所见的爱情被他们成长的社会所束缚。然而，我相信他们能够超越这些社会包袱，看到爱情就是……爱情。”

I sip from my own tea, "Do you think it is something you and Kodama could ever entertain?"  
我啜了一口自己的茶，“你认为你和 Kodama 有可能考虑这种事吗？”

Rei nods and sets her cup down, "Perhaps, if the right person came along that we both fell in love with then I believe we could make it work."  
绫波点点头，放下杯子，“或许，如果有合适的人出现，我们俩都爱上了他，那么我相信我们可以让它成功。”

"I see..." “我明白了...”

"Besides..." Rei continues, "It was Kodama who first thought to suggest I speak to you about it. So, I already know she is not against such concepts."  
"除此之外..." 丽继续说道，"是儿玉首先想到建议我和你谈谈这件事的。所以，我已经知道她并不反对这样的概念。"

"Kodama... suggested you speak to me?" I look at her in some mild shock, I thought this idea had come solely from Rei. I did not think for a second that Kodama was, in a way, behind it.  
"儿玉...建议你和我谈？" 我有些惊讶地看着她，我以为这个主意完全是丽想出来的。我从未想过儿玉在某种程度上也参与其中。

"Yes, I was... concerned about Shinji after he discovered you and Asuka were an item. I was also concerned for the pair of you when you met Shinji again. I knew about the unresolved feelings you all had for one another." She begins to explain, "I expressed these worries to Kodama, and it was her who suggested to speak to you about the situation."  
"是的，在真嗣发现你和明日香在一起后，我对他感到担忧。当你们再次遇到真嗣时，我也为你们俩担心。我知道你们之间未解决的感情问题。" 她开始解释，"我把这些担忧告诉了儿玉，是她建议我和你谈谈这个情况的。"

I smile, "She is... still trying to help me. Tell her thank you."  
我微笑道：“她还在努力帮助我。告诉她谢谢。”

"She cares a lot about you." Rei answers, "She helped me come to terms with my feelings regarding you as well. She made me see that you and I... are not so different, even if at one point we were technically on opposite sides."  
“她很关心你。”丽回答，“她也帮助我接受了对你的感情。她让我明白，你和我...并没有那么不同，即使曾经我们在技术上是站在对立面的。”

I shake my head, "We weren't on opposite sides by choice... we were used Rei."  
我摇摇头，“我们不是自愿站在对立面的...我们是被人利用了，丽。”

"I know... and that is why I want to help you as well. You are my friend and so are they, you deserve happiness." She takes another sip.  
"我知道...这也是为什么我也想帮助你。你是我的朋友，他们也是，你值得幸福。" 她又抿了一口。

"I'm just worried about getting it wrong, what if I suggest it at the wrong moment and it causes problems for me and Asuka. What if it causes them to drift further apart, the last thing I want to do is ruin their friendship and the last thing I want to do is ruin what me and Asuka have."  
"我只是担心会弄巧成拙，万一我在不合适的时机提出来，给我和明日香带来麻烦怎么办？万一这让他们关系更加疏远，我最不想做的就是破坏他们的友谊，也不想破坏我和明日香的关系。"

"Nor would you want to risk Asuka realizing she loves Shinji more and running off with him." She offers up another, heartbreaking, scenario, "It is a valid possibility and maybe you are right... acting on this could cause pain for one or all three of you. Perhaps your relationship with Asuka or the friendships you have. Yet... you were friends with Asuka before you entered a relationship with her, were you not?"  
"你也不想冒着明日香意识到她更爱真嗣，然后和他私奔的风险吧。" 她提出了另一个令人心碎的设想，"这是有可能的，也许你是对的...介入这件事可能会给你们中的一个或全部带来痛苦。可能会影响你和明日香的关系，或是你们的友谊。不过...你和明日香在交往之前就是朋友，不是吗？"

"True..." "确实..."

"And there was a risk of that friendship being ruined was there not?"  
"而且，那种友谊可能会因此破裂，不是吗？"

"That is also true but that wasn't as if it happened because I asked... it just sort of... happened."  
"那也是真的，但那并不是因为我问了才发生的...它就那么...自然而然地发生了。"

"in which case perhaps, this will also 'just happen'. When the right moment presents itself then I feel It will happen. As for the risk, love is always a risk but it is worth it, is it not?"  
如果是那样的话，或许这件事也会'自然而然'发生。当合适的时机到来时，我感觉它就会发生。至于风险，爱情总是有风险的，但它值得，不是吗？

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I can see the discomfort in Hikari's eyes as she looks around after my little revelation. It's been just under a minute, she hasn't said anything and I haven't added anything else yet. She won't know anything else that happened but I imagine she already knows none of it will be good.  
我能看到光眼中的不安，她在我透露了一点之后环顾四周。已经过去不到一分钟，她还没说什么，我也没有再补充什么。她不会知道其他发生了什么，但我想她已经知道那些都不会是好事。

She's probably thinking about what she could say to that. After all what do you say to someone in this situation? What do you say to someone who has just told you their mother died tragically and is about to tell you more, tell you about how it affected them deeply and fucked up their life?  
她可能在想该对此说些什么。毕竟，在这种情况下你对别人说什么呢？你对一个刚刚告诉你他母亲悲惨去世，并即将告诉你更多，告诉你这件事如何深深影响了他，毁了他的生活的人说什么呢？

_'I'm so sorry to hear that Asuka'  
'听到这个消息我真的很抱歉，明日香。'_

Such a cliché. Said to me so many times and one I've said myself to people on occasion. Everyone says it because we can't say anything else. What else can we do but throw out a cliché? At least it shows they care, at least it shows there is support there. Sometimes the best way is to use a cliché, thank you Fish for that one.  
真是陈词滥调。这句话我听过无数次，自己也偶尔对别人说过。大家之所以说，是因为我们别无选择。除了抛出一句陈词滥调，我们还能做什么呢？至少这表明他们在乎，至少这表明有支持存在。有时候，使用陈词滥调是最好的方式，谢谢你，菲什，给了我这个启示。

"I'm sorry." She finally says after some time, "You... You know if you don't want to talk about this... we don't have to."  
“对不起。”她终于在一段时间后说道，“你……如果你不想谈这个……我们不必谈。”

"I know." I nod, "But... I do want to talk about it. I need to talk about it, so I can set things straight between us and maybe help you understand who I am and why I'm the way I am."  
"我知道。" 我点头，"但是... 我确实想谈谈这件事。我需要谈谈，这样我们之间才能理清关系，也许还能帮助你理解我是谁，以及我为什么会是这样。"

"Asuka... you don't need to explain anything. I'm your friend and I always will be." She answers and gives me a little smile.  
"明日香... 你不需要解释什么。我是你的朋友，而且永远都是。" 她回答道，并给了我一个浅浅的微笑。"

"I know." I say it again and nod again along with it, "I know, but talking is supposed to be good for you right? I... want to do this."  
"我知道。" 我又一次说道，并随之再次点头，"我知道，但谈话对你有好处，对吧？我... 想这么做。"

"Okay, just know that... if you want to stop and talk about anything else... we can." Hikari squeezes my hand as she says it. It's funny, once upon a time I'd have gotten offended by someone trying to do that. It'd have sent me into a rage, demanding that people don't touch me and telling them I don't need their support or pity. It'd have made me look 'weak', now... I like it. It feels comforting.  
"好吧，要知道...如果你想要停下来谈论其他事情...我们可以。" 光握紧我的手说道。有趣的是，曾经我可能会因为有人试图这样做而感到冒犯。那会让我暴怒，要求人们不要碰我，并告诉他们我不需要他们的支持或怜悯。那会让我显得'软弱'，现在...我喜欢这样。感觉很安慰。

"I'll start at the beginning... my mother was one of the leads for the Evangelion project. Specifically, Evangelion Unit 02. It was her job to work with the others around the world and help develop what'd become the standard for the Evangelion series." I begin to explain to her, "She wasn't supposed to tell anyone but she told me all about it, as much as a kid could understand anyway. She told me that 'Mama was working on something that'd save the world' and one day I'd help her do it."  
"我从头开始讲...我母亲是 EVA 计划的主要负责人之一。具体来说，是 EVA 二号机的负责人。她的工作是与世界各地的其他人合作，帮助开发将成为 EVA 系列标准的东西。" 我开始向她解释，"她本不该告诉任何人，但她把这一切都告诉了我，尽管作为一个孩子能理解的程度有限。她告诉我'妈妈正在做一件能拯救世界的事情'，有一天我会帮助她完成它。"

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"One day something changed, she didn't come home in a good mood, she was... shaken up. I was too young to understand it all but I know now it was because she had just found out about Shinji's mother. Shinji's mother had done the first contact experiment with Evangelion Unit 01 and they lost her."  
"有一天，情况发生了变化，她回家时心情不好，她...受到了震动。我当时太小，无法完全理解，但我知道现在这是因为她刚刚得知了真嗣的母亲的事情。真嗣的母亲进行了 EVA 初号机的首次接触实验，然后他们失去了她。"

"Did she know Shinji's mother?"  
"她知道真嗣的母亲吗？"

I nod, "They studied together apparently and were good friends. They worked pretty close with one another. It's weird... Had things not went the way they had done me and Shinji could have been childhood friends."  
我点点头，“据说他们一起学习并且是好朋友。他们彼此之间合作得很紧密。真奇怪...如果事情没有按照那样发展，我和真嗣本可以成为童年好友的。”

"When did you find out about that?"  
"你什么时候发现这一点的？"

"Only in the last year or so and I doubt Shinji knows about any of it. I had to... ask and poke about a bit and I don't see him doing that. Although... maybe Rei has told him." I answer her, "Anyway... after that she spent more time working and less time at home with me and Papa. I think what happened to Shinji's mom scared her, and she wanted to avoid it or... she knew she was in danger."  
"仅仅是在过去一年左右的事情，我怀疑真嗣对此一无所知。我不得不...询问并打探一些情况，我看他不太可能这么做。不过...也许绫波已经告诉他了。" 我回答她，"无论如何...在那之后，她花更多时间在工作上，和我以及爸爸在家的时间少了。我想真嗣妈妈的事情吓到她了，她想避免这种情况或者...她知道自己处于危险之中。"

I feel that ache at the back of my throat that signifies the closeness of tear and I try to swallow it away. I'm not going to cry in public damnit, I can cry later. Just... get this out for now Asuka. Hikari squeezes my hand again in support.  
我感到喉咙后部那种预示着泪水即将到来的痛楚，我试图咽下去。该死的，我不会在公共场合哭的，我可以稍后再哭。只是...现在先把这些说出来，明日香。光再次握紧我的手以示支持。

"I can't be certain but I think Shinji's mother knew in advance what was going to happen but she made peace with that... she was willing to carry that burden but I don't know if she wanted others to." I continue to speak, "I remember my parents arguing one night, my father screaming at her about her obsession and my mother only repeating that she had to solve Yui's problem. It was... my last memory of them together."  
"我不敢肯定，但我认为真嗣的母亲事先知道会发生什么，但她接受了这一点...她愿意承担那个负担，但我不确定她是否希望别人也这么做。" 我继续说道，"我记得父母有一次晚上争吵，父亲对她着迷的事情大喊大叫，而母亲只是重复说她必须解决唯的问题。那是...我最后一次记得他们在一起的记忆。"

"She couldn't refuse to do the contact experiment could she?"  
"她无法拒绝进行接触实验，不是吗？"

I shake my head, "No, no choice at all. I imagine if she refused or tried to run then the consequences would have been worth. So it was either figure out how to not recreate what happened to Yui or face worse consequences. My mother... she didn't want to die, but she didn't want anything to happen to her family either. So... she ended up doing the experiment..."  
我摇摇头，“不，根本没有选择。我想如果她拒绝或试图逃跑，后果将不堪设想。所以要么想办法避免重蹈覆辙，要么面对更严重的后果。我的母亲……她不想死，但她也不想让家人受到任何伤害。所以……她最终还是进行了实验……”

I trail off as the memories of those days come rushing back to me. I was so very young and the memories now are fragmented but vivid. I can remember being alone in a room, playing with some toys out of a box. I can remember the sound of alarms and being scared when I heard the shouts and screams from outside. I remember crying when I heard them.  
我话音渐弱，那些日子的记忆如潮水般涌回。那时我非常年幼，记忆现在虽已支离破碎但依然鲜明。我记得自己独自一人在房间里，玩着从盒子里拿出的玩具。我记得警报声响起，听到外面的喊叫和尖叫声时感到害怕。我记得听到那些声音时哭了。

I can remember when the people came to take me, their hushed voices as they spoke amongst themselves and shot me worried glances. All I could do was stand there on my own, cry and ask about mama.  
我记得当那些人来到我身边带走我时，他们低声交谈，不时投来忧虑的目光。我只能独自站在那里，哭泣并询问妈妈的情况。

I can remember my father, such as he was, taking me by the hand and leading me away. He told me there had been an accident and mama had been hurt. He lied to me that she would be alright and a moment later I saw him joking with one of the nurses and feeling her up. By that point my parents had broken up, my mother's obsession with fixing Yui's problem had torn a hole in their relationship.  
我记得我的父亲，尽管他那样，牵着我的手带我离开。他告诉我发生了一场事故，妈妈受伤了。他骗我说她会没事的，而下一刻我看到他在和一名护士开玩笑并抚摸她。那时我的父母已经分手，母亲对修复唯问题的痴迷在他们之间撕开了一道裂痕。

I remember throwing up in the corridor and being taken away and cleaned up by one of the other nurses. A nice woman with glasses called Nurse Makinami. I always remembered her kindness and wish I could see her again. My writing name is a tribute to her, I don't know if her first name was Mari but it seemed to fit.  
我记得在走廊里呕吐，然后被另一名护士带走并清理干净。那位戴眼镜的好心女士叫真希波护士。我总是记得她的善意，希望还能再见到她。我的笔名就是对她的致敬，虽然我不知道她的名字是否是真希波，但这个名字似乎很合适。

"What happened?" Hikari asks me, her voice quivering. She seems to be having as tough a time holding back the tears as me.  
"发生了什么？" 光问我，她的声音颤抖着。她似乎和我一样，努力忍住泪水。

"Mama was... damaged. Incapable of recognizing me... my father or any of her co-workers. At first the doctors were optimistic that it was just a temporary thing. A sort of amnesia brought on by the shock of the experiment. They didn't know the truth though... they were just regular doctors in a normal hospital and this was far from a normal situation."  
"妈妈她...受到了伤害。无法认出我...我的父亲或她的任何同事。起初医生们还乐观地认为这只是暂时的。一种由实验冲击引起的失忆症。但他们并不知道真相...他们只是普通医院的普通医生，而这种情况远非寻常。

"What... was the truth?" "真相...是什么？"

"Mama..." I bite my bottom lip briefly to try to stem the tears, I look around the room for a moment until I can find a way to speak, "...had been torn in two. The part of her that I knew, that I loved and that loved me... that recognized me was lost to the Eva forever and all that had been left behind was a shell. An empty husk that hated me... that did nothing but speak to a ragdoll and warn it about me..."  
"妈妈..." 我咬了咬下唇，试图止住泪水，环顾房间片刻，终于找到开口的方式，"...她被撕裂成了两半。我所认识、所爱且爱我的那部分她...那个能认出我的她，永远消失在了 Eva 之中，留下的只是一个空壳。一个憎恨我的空壳...只会对着一个布娃娃说话，警告它提防我..."

"Oh Asuka..." "哦，明日香..."

"Mama had tried to solve Yui's problem by introducing a new stage to the contact experiment, she wanted to create a copy of a person's mind and implant that instead. Similar to the dummy plugs that were used later on but there was one flaw." I explain, "The Eva's didn't need a mind directing them... they needed a soul, a real... human soul."  
"妈妈试图通过引入新的接触实验阶段来解决 Yui 的问题，她想创造一个人思维的副本并植入其中。类似于后来使用的模拟插入栓，但有一个缺陷。" 我解释道，"Eva 们不需要一个指挥它们的思维...它们需要的是灵魂，一个真正的...人类灵魂。"

Hikari's hand tightens around mine, "Asuka..."  
光的手紧紧握住我的，“明日香……”

"Mama... the shell that was left behind it... took its own life. I guess... I guess... I don't know... I was... I discovered the body."  
“妈妈……那个留下的壳……它自己选择了结束。我想……我想……我不知道……我当时……我发现了遗体。”

Hikari lets a tear fall down her cheek and I feel myself blink several times to keep my own at bay. I choke out my words, "From that day on I... relinquished any sort of childhood I could have had. I decided I wasn't going to be a child anymore, I wasn't going to accept anyone's help or support. All I needed was myself and I was going to be better than anyone else."  
光让一滴泪滑过她的脸颊，我感觉自己眨了几次眼以抑制自己的泪水。我哽咽着说出话来，“从那天起，我……放弃了任何可能拥有的童年。我决定不再做个孩子，不再接受任何人的帮助或支持。我只需要我自己，我要变得比任何人都强。”

"Asuka..." Hikari shakes her head and squeezes my hand.  
"明日香..." 光摇了摇头，紧紧握住我的手。

"I was a goddamn four-year-old child Hikari." I hear the growl in my voice, "No one... not one person tried to stop me. My father he... made a half-arsed attempt but by that point he had shcked up with another family, had a step son that he didn't need to deal with in the same way he would me. So I was handed off to Gehirn. The commanders and people there were all too happy to have this item delivered into their possession."  
"我当时只是个四岁的小孩，光。" 我听到自己声音中的怒意，"没有人...没有一个人试图阻止我。我父亲他...做了个半吊子的尝试，但那时他已经和另一个家庭同居，有了一个不需要像对待我那样对待的继子。所以我被交给了 GEHIRN。那里的指挥官和人们都太高兴能把这个物品收入囊中。"

"They just... took you in?"  
"他们就...这样收留了你？"

I nod, "Of course they did, I was a perfect candidate to become a soldier. They could use my grief and my determination and mold me into the idea pilot and soldier. As long as I got praise from them, I was obedient. They stroked my ego, fed the flames and I excelled in everything I did. My attitude problem notwithstanding because in the long run they had what they wanted. An asset, a perfect little soldier that was ultimately expendable."  
我点头，“当然他们这么做了，我是一个成为士兵的完美人选。他们可以利用我的悲伤和决心，将我塑造成理想的飞行员和士兵。只要我能得到他们的赞扬，我就会顺从。他们抚慰我的自尊，煽动我的热情，我在所做的每件事上都表现出色。尽管我有态度问题，但长远来看，他们得到了他们想要的。一个资产，一个完美的小士兵，最终是可以牺牲的。”

"You had no other family?"  
“你没有其他家人吗？”

"I did." I answer her, "But either they didn't care enough to reach out to me or Gehirn saw to it they weren't able to. I never realized it until I was older and looked back but all I was at that age was a frightened little girl, desperate to be held and lashing out in grief. No adult should have taken me seriously but my father ran and Gehirn manipulated me. They took advantage of me..."  
“我有。”我回答她，“但要么是他们不够关心，没有联系我，要么是 Gehirn 确保他们无法做到。直到我长大后回顾过去，我才意识到，在那个年纪，我只是一个害怕的小女孩，渴望被拥抱，因悲伤而愤怒。没有成年人应该认真对待我，但我的父亲逃走了，Gehirn 操纵了我。他们利用了我……”

"I... had no idea." She shakes her head, "I'm so sorry Asuka..."  
"我...完全不知道。" 她摇摇头，"真对不起，明日香..."

"It isn't your fault and... I can't blame them entirely." I reassure her, "Maybe at some point when I was growing up, I should have saw what I was and what I was becoming. I should maybe have saw the damage I was doing to myself and reached out but I never did."  
"这不是你的错，而且...我也不能完全怪他们。" 我安慰她，"也许在我成长的过程中，我本该意识到自己是谁，自己正在变成什么样。我或许应该看到自己正在对自己造成的伤害，并寻求帮助，但我从未这么做。"

"Was there anyone you could have reached out to?"  
"你有没有可以求助的人呢？"

I shrug, "I don't know... I guess I opened up a bit to Misato and Kaji but not as much as I should have done. With Misato you... well you know what she was like, I don't think she knew what to do or say. With Kaji he's... well he was a bit of a typical man and I only opened up to him because I thought it'd make him feel sorry for me and let us grow closer... silly childhood crushes."  
我耸耸肩，“我不知道……我想我对美里和加持敞开了一些心扉，但没有达到应有的程度。对美里，你……嗯，你知道她是什么样的，我觉得她不知道该怎么做或说什么。至于加持，他……呃，他有点像个典型的男人，我之所以向他敞开心扉，是因为我想这会让他为我感到难过，让我们更亲近……愚蠢的童年迷恋。”

Hikari takes a few moments to regain her composure. I have, through some miracle, managed to keep my tears at bay. The knot in my stomach is tightening though and I'm sure I would be crying, were I not in public.  
光花了些时间恢复镇定。我不知怎么地，奇迹般地忍住了泪水。但胃里的结却在收紧，我敢肯定，要不是在公共场合，我一定会哭出来。

"Have you told anyone else about all of this?"  
“你有没有把这一切告诉过其他人？”

"Yes." I answer her, "Kaworu and Rei know everything. Shinji knows... bits and pieces. I've obviously never sat down with him and told him it all properly. Given that idiots past I don't know if I ever could."  
"“是的。”我回答她，“渚薰和绫波丽知道一切。真嗣只知道一些零碎的片段。我显然从未坐下来好好地告诉他全部。考虑到过去的那些蠢事，我不知道我是否能做到。”

For a moment my mind flashes back to the 'near kiss' from last night. I wonder if it would actually be possible now to even speak to him after that, never mind unload all of this. I thought that, after speaking to Rei, I might have more of an idea of what to do but everything is so complicated because of it.  
"有那么一刻，我的思绪闪回到昨晚的‘差点接吻’。我在想，经历了那件事后，现在是否还能和他交谈，更别提倾诉这一切了。我以为，和绫波丽谈过后，我可能会更清楚该怎么做，但因为这一切，事情变得如此复杂。”

I wonder if maybe I should mention It to Hikari but as I look at the girl crying and trying to regain some composure, I realize it isn't wise. I've just unloaded so much baggage onto her I can't add anymore. This is supposed to be two friends reuniting after years apart. We should be laughing and making fun of our boyfriends.  
"我在想，也许我应该告诉光，但当我看着这个女孩哭泣并试图恢复镇定时，我意识到这并不明智。我已经把太多负担倾倒给她，不能再增加了。这应该是两个多年未见的朋友重逢的时刻。我们应该笑着，调侃我们的男朋友。”

No, I'll have to figure this one out on my own. I had an idea of what I should do but now I'm doubting myself.  
不，我得自己解决这个问题。我原本有个主意，但现在我开始怀疑自己了。

"Sorry." I finally say after some time, "I didn't mean to bring you down or anything."  
“对不起。”过了一会儿，我终于说道，“我不是有意让你沮丧或什么的。”

"No... It's fine." Hikari shakes her head, "You haven't I just... wish I had known at the time. I would have... tried to help."  
“不……没关系。”光摇摇头说，“你并没有，我只是……希望当时我知道就好了。我本可以……试着帮忙的。”

"I wouldn't have let you Hikari." I answer her plainly, "I had to want the help, I had to be ready to accept help and back then I wasn't ready or willing. I'd have just pushed you away like I did to everyone else. Besides... you told me yourself, you had your sisters to deal with and school...it wouldn't have been fair."  
"我不会让你介入的，小光。" 我坦率地回答她，"我必须想要得到帮助，必须准备好接受帮助，而那时我既没有准备好也不愿意。我只会像对待其他人一样把你推开。此外...你自己也说过，你有姐妹要照顾，还有学业...那对你不公平。"

"I understand but now... if you need anything, I am here, please... know that."  
"我明白，但现在...如果你需要什么，我在这里，请...记住这一点。"

"I know..." I nod, "And thank you."  
"我知道...“ 我点头，“谢谢你。"

### Chapter 26: Full Circle  
第二十六章：圆满  

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

I bring the bow across the strings with my right hand, care to not add too much pressure as the notes ring out. At the same time, I bring my left hand up towards the top end of the cellos neck. I quickly move the fingers on my left hand into the correct position and press down. I bring the bow back and let the chord ring out again for a few seconds before quickly shifting to the next chord and then returning to the first.  
我用右手将弓横跨在弦上，小心翼翼地不施加过多压力，让音符悠扬而出。与此同时，我将左手举向大提琴颈部的高端。我迅速将左手的手指移至正确的位置并按下。我将弓拉回，让和弦再次回响几秒钟，然后迅速切换到下一个和弦，再回到第一个。

Behind the sounds of my own cello I can hear the sound of the click track playing loudly in my ear to help me keep time with the rest of the group. Behind that I can actually hear the rest of my group, the live band and the singer. I try to make sure I don't focus too much on what others are playing or the words of the singer and instead focus on working through this chord sequence. It's one of the ones I struggled with in practice but I'm nearly through without any mistakes.  
在我的大提琴声背后，我能听到耳中响亮的节拍器声，帮助我与乐队的其他成员保持同步。在那背后，我还能听到乐队的现场演奏和歌手的声音。我尽量确保不过于关注其他人的演奏或歌手的歌词，而是专注于完成这个和弦序列。这是我在练习中遇到困难的一个，但我几乎已经无误地完成了。

A few chord changes later and I finally arrive at the end of the sequence and to the end of the song itself. This also marks the end of the first half of the concert. Only another hour of playing left followed by the encore and I'm through this. I can feel the sweat on my forehead and the pounding in my chest as I take a moment to look up and over the audience who has risen to their feet and is giving everyone on stage a standing ovation.  
几经和弦变换，我终于抵达了曲终的尾声。这也标志着音乐会上半场的结束。只剩下一个小时左右的演奏，接着是安可曲，我就能熬过这一关了。我感受到额头的汗水和胸中的悸动，抬头望向起立鼓掌的观众，他们为台上的每个人献上了热烈的掌声。

I take this time to locate the row with all my loved ones, it doesn't take me long to do so, the trio of Asuka, Rei and Kaworu standing out among the more reserved hair colours of the rest of the audience. I turn quickly to see the others in my group, they're also looking out over the audience trying to locate their loved ones. Most of them with a mixture of happiness and relief on their faces.  
我趁机寻找着亲友所在的座位，很快便找到了，明日香、绫波和渚在观众中那些较为保守的发色中显得格外突出。我迅速转身看向我的团队成员，他们也在观众中寻找着自己的亲人，脸上混合着喜悦和释然。

My eyes return to my loved ones, they've all located me and I feel my cheeks glow red in response to their gazes. Misato is shooting me a big grin and cheering loudly, if she is this loud at the break then how loud will she be at the end of the show? Touji gives me a big thumbs up and yells something, this earns him an elbow in the stomach from Hikari. Rei smiles at me as she continues to clap politely. Next to her is Asuka and Kaworu, Asuka gives me an encouraging nod and Kaworu smiles warmly as the two of them applaud.  
我的目光回到我爱的人身上，他们都已经找到了我，我感到双颊因他们的注视而泛起红晕。美里对我露出大大的笑容，并大声欢呼，如果她在休息时就这么响亮，那演出结束时她会有多大声呢？冬二对我竖起大拇指并喊了些什么，这让光子用肘部轻轻撞了他一下。丽微笑着继续礼貌地鼓掌。她旁边是明日香和薰，明日香鼓励地点点头，薰则温暖地微笑着，两人一同鼓掌。

I feel a strange flutter in my stomach at catching their gaze but have little time to think about it as we receive the cue to leave the stage. I make sure my cello is placed correctly on the stand and slot my bow into a holder next to it before turning to leave.  
当他们的目光与我相遇时，我感到一阵奇异的悸动，但没时间多想，因为我们收到了离开舞台的提示。我确保我的大提琴正确地放在架子上，并将弓插入旁边的插槽中，然后转身离开。

It's been a few days since I've had the chance to see Asuka and Kaworu, something I regret but I've been busy with practicing and in my free time I suppose I... I've been avoiding them. What happened with Asuka the other day is fresh in my memory and I'm unable to shift this strange feeling of regret. Regret at it nearly happening and regret at it... not actually happening.  
自从有机会见到明日香和薰已经过去几天了，我对此感到遗憾，但我一直忙于练习，而在我的空闲时间里，我想我……一直在回避他们。那天与明日香发生的事情仍历历在目，我无法摆脱这种奇怪的后悔感。后悔它差点发生，也后悔它……实际上没有发生。

I wanted to kiss her... and I know that makes me a bad person because I know what would have happened and what pain would have been caused if I had done it. Yet... I still regret not kissing her because then maybe... she would have been mine. Maybe I would have fulfilled that desire I had for so many years.  
我想吻她...我知道这让我成了坏人，因为我知道如果我那么做了，会发生什么，会带来怎样的痛苦。然而...我还是后悔没有吻她，因为那样或许...她就会属于我。也许我就能实现多年来对她的渴望。

If that sounds bad then... I suppose that is because it is and I kick myself for thinking it. I love her and I want to be with her but not that way. Not at the expense of another person, not if it involves hurting another person. I've been hurt so much in my own life because of another person's selfishness that I don't want to do that.  
如果这听起来很糟糕，那么...我想确实如此，我为此自责。我爱她，想和她在一起，但不是以这种方式。不是以牺牲他人为代价，不是以伤害他人为前提。我的人生因他人的自私而受过太多伤害，我不想再那样做了。

It is just the case I suppose that me and Asuka aren't supposed to be. I am... fine with this. I'm not especially happy but in time I will move forward. I am, if anything thankful for her friendship and I will always love her and support her. The same with Kaworu. Maybe it is better this way, I love them both and... I cannot be with them both.  
我想，我和明日香注定无缘。我对此...坦然接受。虽然并不特别开心，但时间会让我继续前行。如果说有什么值得感激的，那就是她的友谊，我会永远爱她、支持她。对渚薰也是如此。或许这样更好，我爱他们两个，但我不能同时和他们在一起。

I will move forward, I have been stalling for so many years because I've been scared to do so. I've been stalling because I feel so much guilt over who I was and who I think I am but I need to start to move past that. These past few months have been the start of a turning point for me and I don't want to move backwards. I want to live my life, I want to be happy for my friends and I want them to be happy for me.  
我将向前迈进，多年来我一直拖延，因为我害怕这样做。我拖延是因为我对过去的自己和现在的自己感到深深的愧疚，但我需要开始超越这一点。过去的几个月对我来说是一个转折点的开始，我不想后退。我想过自己的生活，我希望我的朋友们快乐，也希望他们为我感到快乐。

I have not told MIsato this yet, nor have I told anyone else but my group and the band on stage have been offered a recording contract. They want us to record the songs from tonight's concert for an album and they also want us to write some original pieces with a look forwards a television performance.  
我还没有告诉 Misato 这件事，也没有告诉其他人，但我们这个团体和台上的乐队已经收到了一份录音合同。他们希望我们录制今晚音乐会的歌曲作为专辑，并希望我们创作一些原创作品，展望未来的电视演出。

The idea of it terrifies me. For so long I've been scared to be out in public because I feared people knew who I was. I couldn't walk down a street with two people on it because I thought they might recognize me. Tonight, I'm performing in front of a crowd of two thousand people and if this television performance happens it'll be millions.  
这个想法让我感到恐惧。长期以来，我一直害怕在公众场合露面，因为我担心人们知道我是谁。我无法在有两人的街道上行走，因为我以为他们可能会认出我。今晚，我将在两千人面前表演，如果这次电视演出成真，那将是数百万观众。

I will be fine though. I know I will I just have to keep moving forward.  
我会没事的。我知道我能行，只需要继续前进。

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

I am so proud of him.  
我为他感到非常骄傲。

I am so very proud of him.  
我真是太为他骄傲了。

That is all I've thought for the past hour as I've watched that young man on that stage and play those songs. Pride fills every part of me to see what he has become, to think about all the obstacles he has overcome in his life to get to this point. I only hope he knows how proud I am of him.  
过去的一个小时里，我一直在台下看着那个年轻人表演，听着他弹奏那些歌曲。看到他如今的模样，想到他一生中克服了那么多障碍才走到今天这一步，我的内心充满了骄傲。我只希望他知道我为他感到多么自豪。

I just question if I really deserve to feel any pride at all, maybe I should be feeling shame because of how I've been and how little I've done to actually help him. I met Shinji five years ago and for those first few months that I knew him, when I took him into my home, I treated him like crap. If he wasn't doing every chore around the apartment and cleaning up after me, I was putting him into life or death situations.  
我只是怀疑自己是否真的有资格感到任何骄傲，也许我应该感到羞愧，因为我曾经那样对待他，实际上为他做的那么少。五年前我遇到了真嗣，在我认识他的最初几个月里，当我把他带回家时，我对他很糟糕。如果他没有做公寓里的每一件杂事并为我收拾残局，我就会把他置于生死攸关的境地。

If Shinji had walked away from me after Third Impact I wouldn't have blamed him. He could very easily have gone to live with another family, who would have been able to be proper parents to him. A family that could have supported him properly and let him enjoy some of his teenage years. I wouldn't have stopped him, after all he deserved better than me.  
如果真嗣在第三次冲击后离开了我，我不会怪他。他完全可以去和另一个家庭生活，那家人能够成为他真正的父母。一个能够真正支持他并让他享受青春年华的家庭。我不会阻止他，毕竟他值得比我更好的人。

I was never really an 'active' guardian to Shinji, nor Asuka for that matter. I took in Shinji because on the day I met him I felt sorry for him, I saw his issues with his father and saw a kindred spirit. I didn't have a clue how to handle a child, I could barely handle myself. I could never even figure out what I was supposed to be for him, a mother? A sister? A commanding officer?  
我从未真正成为过真嗣的‘积极’监护人，明日香也是如此。我收养真嗣是因为在那一天遇见他时，我为他感到难过，看到了他与父亲之间的问题，觉得他像是一个灵魂伴侣。我完全不知道如何照顾一个孩子，连自己都难以应付。我甚至从未弄清楚我应该是他的什么角色，是母亲？姐姐？还是指挥官？

Same with Asuka. I took her in by default, just because she had nowhere else and I felt sorry for her. It isn't like I actually did anything to help her out though. I sent them to school, I sent them to NERV and I sent them to fight. That was the extent of my participation. Most of the time I'd just let them get on with things. I always thought that was why he and Rei decided to live with me after Third Impact. The two of them knew what to expect, they could live how they wanted and be comfortable. The only thing they had to deal with was me.  
对明日香也一样。我默认收留了她，只是因为她无处可去，我为她感到难过。但并不是说我真的为她做了什么帮助。我送他们去学校，送他们去 NERV，送他们去战斗。这就是我参与的全部。大多数时候，我只是让他们自己处理事情。我一直以为这就是为什么他在第三次冲击后决定和丽一起住在我这里的原因。他们俩知道会发生什么，他们可以按照自己的方式生活，感到舒适。他们唯一需要应付的就是我。

Who was I exactly? A disgraced military captain from a disgraced government agency. I was a drunkard that was driven forwards by some immature revenge fantasy. I was an immature woman who couldn't handle responsibility nor get a grip on her own life. I was a warmonger... who sent children out to die to avenge my father's death.  
我究竟是谁？一个来自声名狼藉的政府机构的失势军事上尉。我是一个被幼稚的复仇幻想驱使的酒鬼。我是一个不成熟的女人，无法承担责任，也无法掌控自己的生活。我是一个好战者……为了替父亲报仇，不惜让孩子们去送死。

I was all of the above and I was also the closest thing any of them had to a mother. How horrible were their lives if the closest thing they ever had to a parent was a wreck like me?  
我集以上种种于一身，同时也是他们最接近母亲的存在。如果他们最亲近的家长竟是我这样的废人，他们的生活该有多悲惨？

Shinji and Rei made their decision many years ago to remain with me, Asuka made that decision as well. It was on that day that I made the decision to change my ways. I would cut down on alcohol and I would be there for all three of them. I would do what I could to support them in what they wanted to do. I would spend time with them, take them away and advise them. I would do what I could to be the mother they deserved.  
真嗣和丽多年前就决定留在我身边，明日香也做出了同样的选择。就在那天，我决定改变自己。我会减少饮酒，并全力支持他们三人。我会尽我所能支持他们的梦想，陪伴他们，带他们离开，给予他们建议。我会尽我所能成为他们应得的母亲。

Making those changes was not easy, it's been tough to alter my behaviour and I know it has been tough for all three of them. Shinji... that kid has been through so much, much more than anyone else should ever have dealt with. He carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, he was at the brink of the very end and he very nearly took us all over the edge.  
做出这些改变并不容易，改变我的行为方式一直很艰难，我知道对他们三个人来说也同样不易。真嗣……那个孩子经历了太多，远超过任何人应该承受的。他肩负着世界的重担，站在崩溃的边缘，差点就把我们所有人都拖入深渊。

I can't imagine what it must feel like to have been through that and also to carry the guilt from it. He saved us but he was very close to ending it for everyone, and that must eat away at him. Still, he has to let that go and he deserves this moment and the happiness that comes with it more than anyone I know.  
我无法想象经历过这一切，还要背负着那份罪恶感是什么感觉。他救了我们，但也差点终结了所有人的命运，这一定让他内心备受煎熬。尽管如此，他必须放下这一切，他比我所知的任何人都更配得上这一刻和随之而来的幸福。

Actually, that's wrong... Asuka and Rei deserve these sorts of moments as well, they both deserve happiness. Rei was... she was quite literally created just to be a tool. She was an accessory for a madman hell bent on reuniting with his dead wife. She had so many years of being treated as less than human, being told she was just for one purpose, she deserves so much more.  
实际上，这么说也不对……明日香和丽也值得拥有这样的时刻，她们同样值得幸福。丽她……她几乎就是被创造出来当作工具的。她是一个疯子为了与亡妻重聚而制造的附属品。她多年来一直被当作非人对待，被告知只有一个用途，她理应得到更多。

Asuka, when I met her, I was surprised at how well kept together she was for someone who had experienced something so horrific at a young age. I saw a lot of myself in her as well. She did confide me me about what had happened to her when I did ask but I guess I... I never really understood how much she was hurting. I never understand her bravado was her asking for help. I saw the parallels with myself but I never thought about what it was I wanted at that age.  
我第一次见到明日香时，惊讶于她在年幼时经历了如此可怕的事情后，还能保持如此良好的状态。我也从她身上看到了很多自己的影子。当我问起时，她确实向我倾诉了她的遭遇，但我想我……我从未真正理解她有多痛苦。我从未意识到她的勇敢其实是在寻求帮助。我看到了与自己的相似之处，但从未思考过那个年纪我真正想要的是什么。

Instead people just treated her as a kid with a bit of an attitude problem and I never even tried to look beyond it. Everyone blamed her for the way she was but none of us made the effort to break through to her. No one even tried to hug the poor child. I wish I could go back and do that.  
相反，人们只是把她当作一个有点态度问题的孩子，而我从未试图看透这一点。每个人都责怪她的行为，但我们中没有一个人努力去突破她的心防。甚至没有人试图拥抱那个可怜的孩子。我真希望能回到过去，那样做。

I remember when we were in the hot springs together, she said something about me knowing all about her past and I said I did. I told her to just leave it in the past. I should have hugged her, I should have held her and told her that she could talk to me at any time. Instead I let her down, just like everyone else in her life. It's no wonder she left us to go home.  
我记得我们一起在温泉时，她提到我了解她所有的过去，我说是的。我告诉她就把那些留在过去吧。我本应该拥抱她，我本应该抱着她，告诉她随时可以找我倾诉。相反，我和她生命中的其他人一样让她失望了。难怪她离开我们回家了。

I look at her now though and I wonder if maybe that was for the best. Maybe that little bit of independence helped her to find herself and become a better person. I wonder what it was she needed back then, maybe it wasn't a mother figure but something more of a mentor or a big sister.  
如今看着她，我不禁思索或许那才是最好的安排。也许那一点独立性帮助她找到了自我，成为了一个更好的人。我不知道她当时需要的是什么，也许不是一位母亲的形象，而更像是一个导师或大姐姐。

I was really quick to have her move in with me back then, I suppose I was immature and hoping her and Shinji would get along and be a cute couple. I should have maybe pushed for her to live next door or even for Ritsuko to take her in. Maybe that seems strange but I think the two of them might have been good for one another. Both were incredibly smart and gifted people, Ritsuko could be a bit detached but she would have pushed Asuka in the right direction and given praise when needed.  
那时我很快让她搬来和我一起住，我想我当时太不成熟了，希望她和真嗣能相处融洽，成为一对可爱的情侣。我本该建议她住在我隔壁，甚至让律子收留她。这听起来可能有些奇怪，但我认为她们俩可能会对彼此有益。两人都非常聪明且有天赋，律子虽然有些疏离，但她能引导明日香走向正确的方向，并在需要时给予赞扬。

Plus... maybe something like that would have let Ritsuko see she was valuable outside of what Gendo needed her to be.  
此外...也许这样的安排能让律子看到，她在根津野需要之外的价值。

Asuka does at least seem happy now. Her and Kaworu seem happy together as well, it is an interesting couple. I was so certain that she and Shinji would be together but I'm no expert in love. If they make each other happy then that is all that matters I suppose.  
至少现在看来，明日香似乎很幸福。她和渚薰在一起也很快乐，真是一对有趣的组合。我曾那么确信她和真嗣会在一起，但我对爱情并不在行。如果他们能让彼此幸福，那才是最重要的，我想。

I don't really know too much about Kaworu, his history was erased so we don't have records of him pre-his awakening at the start of the year. I'm not especially comfortable with him being her but I expect many weren't comfortable with me taking in Shinji, Asuka and Rei. If I could be given a chance then so should he.  
我对渚薰了解不多，他的过去被抹去了，所以我们没有他年初觉醒前的记录。让他和她在一起，我并不特别放心，但我猜很多人对我收养真嗣、明日香和绫波也不太舒服。如果我能有机会，那么他也应该有。

It must be tough for Shinji though, to see the two of them together. I know how he feels for Asuka and I have an inkling he has similar feelings for Kaworu. I can't imagine that... to see the two people you love together like that. The poor kid... he'll pull through though. Shinji is strong, much stronger than he thinks he is and I am really proud of him.  
不过，对真嗣来说，看到他们俩在一起一定很艰难。我知道他对明日香的感情，我猜他对渚薰也有类似的感觉。我无法想象……看到两个你爱的人在一起。这可怜的孩子……他会挺过去的。真嗣很坚强，比他自己想象的要坚强得多，我真的很为他骄傲。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

My life has changed so much in the last year. I never thought all those months ago, that when I met that strange silver haired guy for the first time that things would have worked out like they did. I can still remember the night I met him for the first time, looking back on it, it's sort of funny. I had bumped into him outside of a store, he had dropped some stuff and it was Rei that told me about him. In fact, Rei didn't just tell me about him, she warned me about him.  
过去一年里，我的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。几个月前，我从未想过第一次遇见那个银发怪人时，事情会发展成这样。我至今仍记得第一次遇见他的那个夜晚，回想起来，还真有点好笑。我在一家商店外撞见了他，他掉了些东西，是丽告诉我的。事实上，丽不仅告诉了我关于他的事，还警告了我。

Of course, I'm Asuka Langley Soryu and I have issues with taking peoples advice. So naturally I went to return his stuff and find out for myself. I pretty much forced my way into his apartment and I can't explain it, there was just some sort of connection. I saw the way he feared other people and saw myself. I saw how he lived and saw someone I... wanted to help. I guess I also saw an opportunity for a friend, I was lonely and needed a friend.  
当然，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，向来不喜欢听别人的建议。所以自然而然，我决定去归还他的东西，亲自了解他。我几乎是强行闯进了他的公寓，无法解释，就是有一种莫名的联系。我看到了他对其他人的恐惧，也看到了自己的影子。我看到了他的生活，看到了一个我……想要帮助的人。我想我也看到了一个交朋友的机会，我那时很孤独，需要一个朋友。

I invited him out to a concert that night, a Genesis tribute act. I didn't really put much thought into what it meant or could mean. To some it might have looked like a date, looking back I guess it was our first date but I never thought of that at the time. I wasn't interested in dating anyone and I didn't think it was a good idea for anyone to date me anyway. It wasn't like I had a good track record with romance.  
那晚我邀请他去听一场 Genesis 致敬音乐会。其实我并没有多想这背后的意义或可能意味着什么。对某些人来说，这或许看起来像是一次约会，回过头看，我想那确实是我们第一次约会，但当时我从未这么想过。我对约会任何人都不感兴趣，也不认为任何人跟我约会是个好主意。毕竟，我在感情方面并没有什么好记录。

The typical date stuff followed though, instead of parting ways after the concert I invited him back to mine. I didn't expect anything to happen, I never wanted anything to happen and neither of us made any moves. We had a few drinks though and he ended up sleeping on my sofa. I still get a good laugh when I remember the following morning, seeing how flustered he got scrambling for his clothes and thinking he had work.  
尽管如此，典型的约会流程还是接踵而至，音乐会结束后我没有与他道别，而是邀请他回我家。我并未期待发生什么，也从不想让事情发生，我们俩都没有任何举动。不过我们喝了些酒，他最终睡在了我的沙发上。至今我仍会因想起第二天早上的情景而发笑，看着他慌乱地找衣服，还以为自己要去上班。

We got to know each other after that, spent more time together. I helped him when he was attacked, looked after him and he cooked me a meal. We played games, went out together and made love. We got back in contact with Shinji eventually and made plans to come to Japan.  
自那以后，我们开始了解彼此，共度更多时光。他遇袭时我帮助了他，照顾他，而他为我做了一顿饭。我们一起玩游戏，外出，并有了肌肤之亲。最终，我们重新联系上了真嗣，并计划前往日本。

Now... So many months later I'm sat next to him in a concert hall in Tokyo-2. We're both applauding as the band and musicans leave the stage after the first half of the show. We're both keeping our eyes on one figure in particular, the man we both love, Shinji Ikari.  
如今……数月之后，我坐在东京-2 的一座音乐厅里，与他并肩而坐。乐队和乐手们在第一场演出结束后离场，我们一同鼓掌。我们的目光都聚焦在一个人身上，那个我们共同深爱的人，碇真嗣。

Shinji Ikari... Weak... Pathetic... The Favorite... The Daddys Boy... Spineless little Shinji... All things I'm guilty of calling him once upon a time. I cringe so much to think about me saying all of those things because I can hear those moments so vividly in my own head. I hate it because I know just how untrue it was and is and I know how much I must have hurt him by saying those things to him.  
碇真嗣……软弱……可悲……宠儿……爸爸的宝贝……无脊梁的小真嗣……这些曾是我一度用来称呼他的词汇。每每想起自己说过这些话，我都感到无比羞愧，因为那些时刻在我脑海中清晰得令人痛苦。我憎恨这些回忆，因为我知道它们是多么的不真实，也明白这些话对他造成了多大的伤害。

He is so far from those things, especially right now. He has been on that stage, playing the cello as part of this concert for thousands of people watching. He is... incredible. He is the furthest thing from weak, he is the furthest thing from cowardly or spineless... and I know he is not the daddy's boy I accused him of being when I didn't know any better.  
他早已远离了那些标签，尤其是此刻。他站在舞台上，作为这场音乐会的一部分，为成千上万的观众演奏大提琴。他是……令人难以置信的。他绝非软弱，绝非怯懦或无脊梁……我也知道，他并非我当初无知时所指责的那个依赖父亲的男孩。

He is incredible and I can't help but love him.  
他真是不可思议，我情不自禁地爱上了他。

Next to me is another man I love and means so much to me. I turn to look at him, just as he does the same, he leans in and whispers to me, "I love you Asuka."  
在我身边的是另一个我深爱且对我意义重大的人。我转头看向他，正好他也看向我，他倾身过来轻声对我说：“我爱你，明日香。”

"I love you too." I reply and kiss him lightly on his lips. I pull away and feel my cheeks begin to glow red as I see Misato grinning at me. I put my hands on my hips, "What? Never seen a girl kiss her boyfriend before?"  
“我也爱你。”我回答道，轻轻吻了他的唇。我退开时，看到美里在旁边咧嘴笑，我双手叉腰，“怎么？没见过女孩亲吻她的男朋友吗？”

As I sit back down those works stick in my head, my boyfriend, and I have to wonder how much longer that will be true? I have to question it because I can't do anything but do that. Ever since we arrived in Japan, ever since I nearly kissed Shinji, those questions and that insecurity has been eating away at me.  
当我再次坐下，那些念头萦绕在脑海，我的男朋友，我不得不怀疑这种情况还能持续多久？我必须质疑，因为我除了这样做别无选择。自从我们来到日本，自从我差点吻了真嗣，那些疑问和不安全感就一直困扰着我。

If something like that can happen between Shinji and myself then why couldn't it happen between Kaworu and Shinji as well?  
如果我和真嗣之间能发生那样的事，那么为什么卡罗和真嗣之间就不能发生呢？

When will Kaworu realize Shinji is a better person than I am?  
卡罗什么时候才会意识到真嗣比我更好呢？

When will I be left behind and do I only have myself to blame when I am left behind?  
何时我会被抛下，当我被抛下时，是否只能怪罪自己？

Being here... seeing these people again, it's something I like and something I wanted but I'm scared I'll be abandoned again. I'm scared that the things I've dreamed about, those moments where I see Shinji and Kaworu walking away from me and I'm left behind will come to fruition. I'm scared that they will both see the truth about who I am.  
回到这里...再次见到这些人，是我喜欢且渴望的事，但我害怕再次被抛弃。我害怕那些梦中的情景，看到真嗣和薰从我身边走远，留下我一个人，会变成现实。我害怕他们俩会发现我真实的一面。

I picture the scene so vividly, they are talking to one another. They're getting closer and suddenly one of them reaches up with their hand. They run their hand through the others hair and cup their cheek softly. They look into one another's eyes and then they kiss. They forget about the world around them and when they come to, they realize the truth.  
我清晰地想象着那个场景，他们正交谈着。他们越来越近，突然其中一人伸出手。他们轻柔地抚过对方的头发，轻触脸颊。他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，然后亲吻。他们忘记了周围的世界，当他们回过神来，才意识到真相。

I hate picturing it and I hate the anger that is brought with it. I hate myself for entertaining the idea for even a second because I know damn well it isn't going to happen. No matter how much I imagine or dream it it isn't going to happen because Shinji and Kaworu aren't those sorts of people. Kaworu won't betray me like that and Shinji wouldn't dare try to steal my boyfriend.  
我讨厌想象那一幕，也讨厌随之而来的愤怒。我恨自己哪怕只是一瞬间也去考虑这个念头，因为我知道这绝不可能发生。无论我怎么想象或梦想，它都不会成真，因为真嗣和薰不是那种人。薰不会那样背叛我，而真嗣也不敢试图抢走我的男朋友。

It's all my own pathetic insecurities mixed in with my irritating guilt complex that is leading to this.  
这一切都是我那可悲的不安全感和我那恼人的负罪感在作祟。

This thing is cut and dry, me and Kaworu are together and we love one another. We may both harbour feelings for Shinji but that is all they are, feelings and all we can do is support him as a friend. Our life has to go on.  
这件事已经很明确了，我和薰在一起，我们彼此相爱。我们俩可能都对真嗣抱有感情，但那只是感情而已，我们能做的就是以朋友的身份支持他。我们的生活还得继续。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

For the last hour my attention has been completely transfixed on by the musicians on that stage. These many talented musicians have transported me to other worlds, made me run the gamut of emotion, provided an experience beyond compare. I have felt shivers run down my spine, my eyes have watered, the hairs on my arms have stood on edge as these performed have delivered us their takes on this music that I have come to love.  
过去的一小时里，我的注意力完全被台上的音乐家们所吸引。这些才华横溢的音乐家将我带入了不同的世界，让我体验了情感的起伏，提供了无与伦比的感受。我感到脊背发凉，眼眶湿润，手臂上的汗毛竖起，他们用这份我已深爱的音乐，为我们呈现了精彩的演绎。

If there is such a thing as a heaven, then I am certain that this must be what it is like. To me, such a thing is the ability to sit and view and appreciate moments such as this in the company of loved ones. To be together, like we all are in this one place to experience this one thing, that must be the closest thing.  
如果说有天堂存在，那么我确信这一定就是它的模样。对我而言，天堂就是能够与挚爱之人坐在一起，欣赏并珍惜这样的时刻。我们所有人聚集在这里，共同体验这一刻，这必定是最接近天堂的感觉。

My only hope is that the interval passes quickly so they can perform the second half of their show.  
我唯一的希望是中场休息能快点过去，这样他们就能继续下半场的表演了。

What of the musicians? My experience at going to live concerts is limited, but I have watched a great many with Asuka. The musicians are supremely talented. On the left of the stage is the main band, comprising a keyboard player, a bassist, two guitarists, drummer and a singer. They are a powerful force, I in particular find the singer to be quite captivating, she sings with a power and emotion rarely seen. It is also interesting to hear a women's vocals on what are typically male orientated tracks.  
那些音乐家们呢？我亲临现场音乐会的经历有限，但和明日香一起观看过许多。这些音乐家才华横溢。舞台左侧是主乐队，包括键盘手、贝斯手、两名吉他手、鼓手和一名主唱。他们极具力量，我尤其觉得那位主唱十分迷人，她的歌声充满力量与情感，实属罕见。听到女性声音演绎通常以男性为主的曲目，也颇有趣味。

On the opposite side of the stage, the section which I find my attention drifting to the most, is the string section. Made up of twelve people in total, with Shinji in the middle row, on the side closest to the bassist.  
舞台的另一侧，是我最常不自觉望向的部分，那就是弦乐组。总共由十二人组成，其中真嗣位于中间一排，靠近贝斯手的位置。

It has been difficult for me to not pay attention to him throughout the entire concert. After all, looking at Shinji on that stage is like one of the most beautiful things I have ever laid my eyes open. I would not wish to do a disservice to the other performers on stage though, so I have tried to give them all equal attention. They have all worked hard in their own ways, they are all uniquely talented and worthy of attention.  
整场音乐会中，我很难不去注意他。毕竟，看着舞台上的真嗣，就像是我所见过的最美景象之一。尽管如此，我也不愿对其他表演者有所怠慢，因此我尽量给予他们同等的关注。他们各自都付出了努力，每个人都有独特的才华，值得被关注。

This Shinji I see on stage though, I feel that perhaps this is the closest I have seen to the real Shinji. He is there, baring his soul for all to see. These songs he performs may not be his own but when I watch him, when I see the look of concentration, the way his fingers move on the neck and the way his hands slide up and down gracefully I can see how he injects his own personality into this music. I can see the way the music flows through him, I can see how he feels it, every peak and trough, every chord, every time signature change. He is at one with the music.  
然而，舞台上这个我看到的真嗣，我觉得这或许是我见过的最接近真实真嗣的样子。他在那里，毫无保留地展示自己的灵魂。他表演的这些歌曲可能不是他自己的，但当我看着他，看到他专注的神情，他手指在琴颈上的移动，以及他双手优雅地上下滑动时，我能看出他是如何将自己的个性注入这段音乐中的。我能看到音乐如何流经他，我能看到他如何感受它，每一个高峰和低谷，每一个和弦，每一次节拍变化。他与音乐融为一体。

Myself and Asuka, we long to be one with him as well. We both love him and this night is only serving to confirm that. It also confirms to me that I must act as soon as possible. I cannot let the opportunity for the three of us to be together slip away. I know what I have to do, and how I am going to do it.  
我和明日香，我们也渴望与他融为一体。我们都爱他，而这个夜晚只是进一步证实了这一点。这也让我确信，我必须尽快采取行动。我不能让三个人在一起的机会溜走。我知道我该做什么，以及我将如何去做。

I turn to look at Asuka once more, I have noticed over the course of the show her eyes have rarely left Shinji. A few days ago, that might have filled me with the familiar fear and anxiety but not tonight. I know the feelings we all share for one another and I know there is nothing to fear. I know that we can all be together it is just waiting for the right moment.  
我再次转向看向明日香，我注意到在演出过程中，她的目光几乎未曾离开过真嗣。几天前，这或许会让我充满熟悉的恐惧和焦虑，但今晚不会。我知道我们彼此间共享的情感，也知道没有什么可害怕的。我知道我们可以永远在一起，只是等待合适的时机。

After the show... our lives will change. Of that I am certain.  
演出结束后……我们的生活将会改变。对此我深信不疑。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

She finishes singing the final note of the song, holding the note for longer than we expected to and then she and all the instruments fall silent on stage. The silence lasts for not even a second but in my mind that second feels like forever. I look up towards the sea of people in front of us all, this faceless crowd of people I don't know and then I look towards the ones I do.  
她唱完了歌曲的最后一个音符，比我们预期的更长地保持着这个音，随后她和所有乐器在舞台上归于寂静。那寂静连一秒钟都不到，但在我心中，那一秒仿佛永恒。我抬头望向我们面前的人群，那些我素未谋面的无脸人群，然后我看向那些我熟悉的面孔。

One by one, or perhaps in groups, the audience begins to stand up and applaud. I feel myself grin stupid as it hits me, we... managed to do it. We were actually able to do it, this group of people around me, this group who barely knew each other a few months ago have managed to perform a full concert. Week by week, session by session, we learned all of these songs. Chord by chord and note by note, we pieced it all together, we rehearsed it all and were able to do this.  
一个接一个，或许是成群结队，观众开始起立鼓掌。我感到自己傻笑着，当这一刻击中我，我们...成功了。我们真的做到了，我周围的这群人，几个月前几乎互不相识的这群人，竟然完成了一场完整的音乐会。一周又一周，一次又一次的排练，我们学会了所有这些歌曲。和弦接和弦，音符接音符，我们一点一滴地将它们拼凑起来，反复排练，最终做到了这一切。

We all helped each other out, when we saw one person was struggling, we worked with them. We all gave each other encouragement, we all wanted to do this and be the best we could be.  
我们互相帮助，当看到有人挣扎时，我们与他们一起努力。我们互相鼓励，我们都想做到最好，成为最好的自己。

I... a person who was terrified of meeting people, have just performed in front of around two thousand people. I was so sure people would recognize me, would hate me because of what I nearly did many years ago but... Misato and Rei were right. I had nothing to fear.  
我...一个害怕与人见面的人，刚刚在约两千人面前表演了。我曾确信人们会认出我，会因为多年前我差点做的事情而恨我，但...美里和丽是对的。我没有什么好害怕的。

All the ones I love were here as well to watch it. Touji, Hikari and Kensuke, my first real friends... ever really. Misato, the guardian who became my mother. Rei... my sister and of course Asuka and Kaworu, the friends that I love. Without any of their support I would not have been able to do this.  
所有我爱的人也都来了，一起观看这场演出。东治、光和真嗣，我真正的第一批朋友……真的。美里，那位成为我母亲般的守护者。丽……我的妹妹，当然还有明日香和薰，我深爱的朋友们。没有他们的支持，我不可能做到这一切。

I need to make sure I thank them all properly after the concert. I wish I could do it now but all I can do is stand here and take in the applause as a voice on the venue PA begins to go through the names of all of us on stage. First, they go through the singer and the backing band, then they introduce all of us in the string section. I feel a strange chill down my spine as my name is read out and I am fairly sure I hear Touji yell something.  
我需要在音乐会后确保好好感谢他们所有人。我希望现在就能这么做，但我现在只能站在这里，接受掌声，同时场馆的 PA 系统开始逐一念出我们舞台上所有人的名字。首先，他们念了主唱和伴奏乐队的名字，然后介绍了我们弦乐部分的所有成员。当我的名字被念出时，我感到一阵奇怪的寒意沿着脊椎而下，我几乎可以肯定我听到了东治的喊声。

Finally, the announcer calls out the name fo the director of our group. He makes his way to the stage through the centre of the two groups and takes a bow before motioning for us all to join him at the front of the stage. We all leave our positions and move carefully to the front and bow with him as the crowd continue to applaud. Once again, I am sure I can hear Touji yelling something, in fact I'm sure I can hear Rei as well!  
最后，主持人喊出了我们团队导演的名字。他从两组人中间走向舞台，鞠了一躬，然后示意我们都到舞台前集合。我们都离开了自己的位置，小心翼翼地走到前面，和他一起向观众鞠躬，掌声依旧不断。我又一次确信我听到了东治的喊声，事实上，我确信我还听到了丽的喊声！

A few moments later we are given the signal for us to leave the stage. As I leave, I give one more look towards them all before quietly following the person in front of me and going towards the backstage area.  
片刻之后，我们得到了离开舞台的信号。我离开时，再次向他们所有人投去一眼，然后默默地跟随前面的人走向后台区域。

That realization is still flying around my head, 'We did it' and... I want to do this again. I loved doing this, I loved performing for this crowd, I loved being able to get lost in the music. I loved... just playing. This is what I want to do now, this is what I want so much, more than anything. I want to play more, I want to compose, I want to record.  
那个念头仍在脑海中盘旋，'我们做到了'，而且……我想再做一次。我喜欢这样做，我喜欢为这个人群表演，我喜欢沉浸在音乐中的感觉。我喜欢……只是演奏。这就是我现在想做的，这就是我如此渴望的，比任何事情都渴望。我想多演奏，我想作曲，我想录音。

I have to let the director know my decision, that I will be joining them for the recordings, that I want to continue but then... I need to tell the rest of them. I need to tell the ones I love, starting with Asuka and Kaworu.  
我必须让导演知道我的决定，我会加入他们进行录音，我想继续下去，但之后……我需要告诉其他人。我需要告诉我爱的人，从明日香和渚薰开始。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I was so certain of what I was going to do, I was so sure I could fight through it but now my mind has been made up of what I should do. It is what I have to do.  
我曾如此确信自己要做的事，坚信能够克服一切，但现在我已决定该怎么做。这是我必须做的。

I first started to have this idea a few days ago, it was just after me and Shinji nearly kissed and before I spoke to Rei. I went around and round with it but I tried to cast it aside. I figured that me and Kaworu are together and we should be, but right now I have to take a different path. It'll be painful but it's the right thing to do.  
这个念头最初是在几天前冒出来的，就在我和真嗣差点接吻之后，与丽交谈之前。我反复思索，试图抛开它。我以为我和薰在一起是应该的，但现在我必须选择另一条路。虽然痛苦，但这是正确的选择。

That isn't to say it hasn't been good and I wish things could be different. I loved each and every moment of the concert tonight. I also thought Bat Out Of Hell as an encore song was a very inspired choice. It's a song that I actually feel like I identify with. In the song the protagonist describes the world they live in as being broken and run down. They talk to the one they love and tell them they're the only pure thing in the whole wide world.  
这并不是说过去不美好，我多希望情况能有所不同。今晚的音乐会每一刻我都深爱着。我还觉得《Bat Out Of Hell》作为返场曲目是个非常灵感的决定。这首歌让我感同身受，歌中的主角描述他们生活的世界支离破碎、破败不堪，他们向所爱之人倾诉，称对方是这广阔世界中唯一的纯净存在。

Only the protagonist can't stay, they have to leave that city and forge a new life. They tell the love interesting they're going to leave and so they do, riding away on their motorbike. They travel too fast and don't see a curve in the road, they fly off the road and end up crashing into a pit where they lay dying. All they can do is watch as their heart leaves their body and flies away.  
唯有主角无法停留，他们必须离开那座城市，开创全新的人生。他们告诉心爱的人即将离去，于是便骑上摩托车，疾驰而去。他们行驶得太快，未曾注意到路上的弯道，结果飞出路面，坠入深坑，奄奄一息。他们只能眼睁睁看着自己的心脏脱离躯体，飞向远方。

Another parallel with me I suppose, when I fought those bastard Evangelions I never saw that goddamn lance coming, and I ended up dying alone. All I could do was watch before I was torn to shreds.  
或许这也是我的写照，当我与那些该死的使徒战斗时，从未预见到那该死的矛会袭来，最终孤独地死去。在我被撕成碎片之前，只能无助地观望。

In some way that character is me. I'm the one seeing the world as broken, or I am broken and Kaworu and Shinji are the pure people that I love. I'm the one who has to leave though, I have to get away. Why? Because all I'll do is cause them pain. I know leaving will hurt them, and I know it'll hurt me too. My heart already hurts so much just thinking about it but I have to do it. I'm not the right person for Kaworu, Shinji is and I'm not the right person for Shinji. Kaworu is.  
在某种程度上，那个角色就是我。我才是那个将世界视为支离破碎的人，或者是我自己破碎了，而渚薰和真嗣是我所爱的纯洁之人。尽管如此，我必须离开，我必须逃离。为什么？因为我只会给他们带来痛苦。我知道离开会伤害他们，也会伤害我自己。光是想到这一点，我的心就已经痛得难以承受，但我必须这么做。我不适合渚薰，真嗣才是，我也不适合真嗣，渚薰才是。

I'm sure in time they'll both understand. What I'll do is return to Germany tonight, get a flight back and send them both a message. I'll tell Shinji to make sure he takes care of Kaworu and I'll tell Kaworu I love him and I hope he understands. I'll say to them both I understand if neither of them wants to see me ever again. I know I'll be miserable at first but that's nothing a ton of ice cream and video game binging can't solve.  
我相信随着时间的推移，他们俩都会理解的。我要做的是今晚返回德国，买张返程机票，然后给他们俩都发条信息。我会告诉真嗣要确保照顾好薰，我会告诉薰我爱他，希望他能理解。我会对他们俩说，如果他们再也不想见我，我也能理解。我知道一开始我会很痛苦，但这没什么是一大桶冰淇淋和疯狂打游戏解决不了的。

Why am I doing this? Because I can see the two of them from here. They're both talking to one another and laughing and smiling. They're both so happy and I just don't belong here. Maybe Kaworu is happy with me, I know I am with him. I love him so much and I don't think he'll ever understand what he means to me. The thing is, I know in time that'll fade. I know he'll come to realize what I am and what I was and he'll leave me. It's what I deserve and so... I'll leave first.  
我为什么要这么做？因为我能从这里看到他们俩。他们正互相交谈、欢笑、微笑。他们俩都很快乐，而我只是不属于这里。也许薰和我在一起是快乐的，我知道我和他在一起是快乐的。我非常爱他，我不认为他会明白他对我意味着什么。问题是，我知道随着时间的推移，这种感觉会消退。我知道他会逐渐意识到我是什么样的人，我过去是什么样的人，他会离开我。这是我应得的，所以...我会先离开。

Goodbye Kaworu. Goodbye Shinji. Good luck to you both. I love you both and so this is the best thing I can do for the two of you.  
再见了，薰。再见了，真嗣。祝你们俩好运。我爱你们俩，所以这是我能为你们俩做的最好的事。

### Chapter 27: Lovers' Leap  
第二十七章：情人跳  

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

"Come with me." “跟我来。”

I quickly move past Shinji, giving him no time at all to reply to my instruction hoping that he will just follow me out of the ballroom. As I walk towards the exit, I once again check the text message from Rei, just to make sure she did say what I thought and expected it to say. I glance over my shoulder and see Shinji is indeed following me, good, I need him for this.  
我迅速从真嗣身边走过，没给他任何回应我指令的时间，希望他会直接跟着我离开舞厅。走向出口时，我又一次查看了丽发来的短信，确认她确实说了我想象和期待的内容。我回头瞥了一眼，看到真嗣确实在跟着我，很好，我需要他来做这件事。

We reach the doors leading out onto the street and almost immediately I see Rei waiting for me. Next to her is a car ready to take me and Shinji to the hotel. She spots me and smiles half-heartedly whilst shrugging her shoulders, "It is exactly as you said it would be Nagisa. Asuka left five minutes ago."  
我们走到通往街道的门前，我几乎立刻就看到了丽在等我。她旁边停着一辆车，准备载我和真嗣去酒店。她看到我，勉强笑了笑，耸耸肩，“正如你所说，渚。惣流五分钟前离开了。”

I smile back at her, "Thank you for letting me know. I had a feeling this would happen."  
我朝她笑了笑，“谢谢你告诉我。我早有预感会发生这种事。”

"W-What's going on?" I hear Shinji ask from behind me. We both turn to face him and see a confused look on his face, "Did Asuka leave? Why? Is everything okay?"  
“发-发生什么事了？”我听到真嗣在我身后问。我们俩转过身面对他，看到他脸上满是困惑，“惣流走了吗？为什么？一切都还好吗？”

I put my hand on his shoulder to try to calm him, "Everything is fine Shinji, but we need to back to the hotel."  
我把手放在他的肩膀上，试图让他平静下来，“一切都好，真嗣，但我们得回酒店。”

"Hotel?" He asks, again looking at both myself and Rei in confusion, "Do you want me to wait here whilst you bring her back?"  
“酒店？”他疑惑地看着我和绫波，“你是要我在这里等你把她带回来吗？”

"No, you have to come with me. I fear that my effort alone will not be enough to bring her back." I again turn to look at Rei, "Thank you for this, truly it does mean a lot."  
“不，你得跟我一起来。我担心仅凭我一个人的努力不足以带她回来。”我再次转向绫波，“谢谢你这么做，真的意义重大。”

"I don't understand." Shinji says, "Why did she leave?"  
"我不明白。" 真嗣说，"她为什么要离开？"

"Asuka left because she is nothing more than an idiot who remains incapable of reading a situation and continues to act without thinking. Not dissimilar to a certain brother of mine." Rei answers with a mild hint of irritation in her voice, "Go with Kaworu to the hotel and bring her back. You can tell her I called her an idiot as well."  
"明日香离开是因为她不过是个无法读懂情势、总是不假思索行事的傻瓜。和我某个哥哥颇为相似。" 绫波回答时语气中带着一丝轻微的恼怒，"跟渚一起去酒店把她带回来。你可以告诉她，我也说她是个傻瓜。"

I laugh as I thank her once again and begin to make my way towards the car. Shinji seems to hesitate for a moment before Rei tells him to go. For a brief moment I feel bad for not fully explaining what is happening and why Asuka has left, but I feel it is something best left until the three of us are together. I sit myself down on one of the seats in the back of the car, Shinji getting in beside me and I instruct the driver to go to the hotel.  
我笑着再次向她道谢，然后开始向车子走去。真嗣似乎犹豫了一下，直到绫波催促他走。有那么一瞬间，我为自己没有完全解释发生了什么以及明日香为何离开而感到内疚，但我觉得最好还是等到我们三个人在一起时再说。我坐进车后座的一个座位上，真嗣坐在我旁边，我吩咐司机去酒店。

I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as the car pulls away. So far things are going how I expected them to go. I had a feeling Asuka would do something like this, the fear she has of being abandoned winning out over common sense. Her idea that she isn't a good person winning out over the love I have for her and the love Shinji has for her. What this does is give me a chance to prove how I feel... how we all feel for one another and move us forward.  
当车子驶离时，我能感觉到自己的心跳在胸腔中剧烈跳动。到目前为止，事情的发展正如我所预料的那样。我早有预感明日香会做出这样的举动，她对被抛弃的恐惧战胜了常识。她认为自己不是个好人的想法，压倒了我对她的爱以及真嗣对她的爱。这反而给了我一个机会，去证明我对她的感情...以及我们彼此间的感情，推动我们向前迈进。

Yet, I have my doubts. I've gone over the moment in my head a few times, thought of key things to say and gestures to make. Questions to ask and answers to give but it could end up being that I am wrong. Perhaps Asuka and Shinji do not feel that way for one another. Perhaps Shinji does not feel that way for me. Perhaps... I would be unable to convince them.  
然而，我心存疑虑。我已经在脑海中反复思考过那一刻，想好了要说的话和要做的动作。准备好了问题和答案，但最终可能证明我错了。也许明日香和真嗣对彼此并没有那种感觉。也许真嗣对我也没有那种感觉。也许...我无法说服他们。

No. This is not the time for that sort of doubt nor that sort of fear. I have to remain confident in my feelings and what is within my heart. If I want us all to be happy like we all can be then I can't doubt myself. If I start to doubt then that is when it all falls apart.  
不。现在不是怀疑或恐惧的时候。我必须对自己的感情和内心保持信心。如果我希望我们都能像我们所能做到的那样幸福，我就不能怀疑自己。一旦开始怀疑，一切就会分崩离析。

"Kaworu... What is going on? How come Asuka left?" I hear Shinji ask me again, "Was it something I..."  
"渚薰...这是怎么回事？为什么明日香离开了？" 我听到真嗣再次问我，"是我做了什么吗..."

"No." I quickly cut him off before he can finish asking that question, "It was not something you did, nor was it something I did. Asuka left because... well I don't wish to be as harsh as your sister but she left because she is seeing something where nothing needs to be seen and she is not seeing that which does need to be seen. There are some... things that need ironing out, that is why I need you with me."  
"不。" 我迅速打断他，不让他问完那个问题，"不是你做了什么，也不是我做了什么。明日香离开是因为...嗯，我不想像你姐姐那样直白，但她离开是因为她看到了不需要看的东西，而没有看到需要看的东西。有些...事情需要解决，这就是为什么我需要你和我一起。"

"I don't... really understand." He answers me but also nods, "But I will go to her with you. I don't want her to be upset or hurt."  
"我不...完全明白。" 他回答我，但也点了点头，"但我会和你一起去见她。我不想让她难过或受伤。"

"I know you don't." I smile as I reach out and place my hand on top of his, I feel him tense up and wonder if maybe I overstepped a boundary but he soon relaxes, "And neither do I. She is very precious to me Shinji, as are you. I would not wish for either of you to be hurt."  
"我知道你不明白。" 我微笑着伸出手，放在他的手上，感觉到他紧张起来，不知道自己是否越界了，但他很快放松下来，"我也是。她对我来说非常珍贵，真嗣，你也是。我不希望你们中的任何一个受到伤害。"

It takes very little time for the car to reach the hotel, for the rest of the journey I feel myself enjoying the warmth and comfort of holding Shinji's hand. Hopefully after tonight that can be a more regular occurrence. The car comes to a stop and we both get out; I thank the driver before moving quickly into the hotel. My chest feels tighter as we step into the lobby, the realization is dawning on me, this is the moment everything will change.  
车子很快就到达了酒店，剩下的路程中，我享受着握着真嗣手的温暖和舒适。希望从今晚开始，这能成为更常见的事情。车停了下来，我们俩都下了车；我向司机道谢后迅速走进酒店。当我们走进大堂时，我的胸口感到更紧了，意识到这一刻一切都将改变。

If I mess this up then... what happens to us afterwards? We've all be quiet about our feelings for one another up until now. We've all surely been aware of it but let them remain under the surface. When I put it out into the open then it creates either an opportunity or an awkward situation.  
如果我搞砸了这件事，那么...之后我们会怎样？我们一直对彼此的感情保持沉默。我们肯定都意识到了，但让它们留在表面之下。当我把它们公开时，这要么创造了一个机会，要么是一个尴尬的局面。

It's an opportunity we can all seize and make work. We can all admit those feelings, and realize they're valid. We can all realize there is a path forward where the three of us can be happy together. Or... we can let it pass us by. We can do nothing and then the situation becomes awkward. By doing this I could destroy the fragile relationships we've built.  
这是一个我们都能抓住并使之实现的机会。我们都可以承认这些感情，并意识到它们是合理的。我们都可以认识到，有一条道路能让三个人一起幸福。或者...我们可以让它从我们身边溜走。我们可以什么都不做，然后情况变得尴尬。这样做可能会摧毁我们建立的脆弱关系。

Humans like tradition, they like to remain within their comfort zone and for many people, change is something to fear, not embrace. I understand this all too well. Change is frightening and can lead to pain. It can lead to being hurt be it physically or emotionally. Sometimes it feels like it is better to do nothing than to risk doing anything. I felt this when I met Asuka, the change in our relationship going from friendship to being in love. It terrified me because I knew there was no going back should things go wrong.  
人类喜欢传统，他们喜欢待在舒适区，对许多人来说，改变是令人恐惧的，而不是应该拥抱的。我对此再明白不过了。改变是可怕的，可能会带来痛苦。无论是身体上还是情感上，都可能导致受伤。有时候，什么都不做比冒险做任何事感觉更好。当我遇到明日香时，我就有了这种感觉，我们的关系从友谊转变为爱情，这让我感到恐惧，因为我知道如果事情出了差错，就无法回到从前了。

Asuka and Shinji... they both fear change. They both fear what will happen to them when they move out of their comfort zone. They have both been hurt so much in their lives... I am ashamed to admit that I have been a part of hurting them as well with what I used to be. I am however convinced that they aren't the sort who wouldn't be open minded in this situation, that they would both embrace love.  
明日香和真嗣...他们都害怕改变。他们都担心离开舒适区后会发生什么。他们一生中都受到了如此多的伤害...我羞愧地承认，我也曾是伤害他们的一员，因为我曾经的样子。然而，我坚信他们不是那种在这种情况下会心胸狭窄的人，他们会拥抱爱情。

Yet... I have observed the fickle nature of humanity. I was told time and time again by my former masters how humans could be. I know a lot of that was dressed up to fit their narrative and secure my co-operation but there were elements fo truth within. I know what this race can be like. I know humanity can be wonderful, loving and caring but I know it can be dark, harsh and cruel. I also know that acceptance has its limits for some.  
然而...我观察到了人性的善变。我的前主人一次又一次地告诉我人类可能是什么样子。我知道很多都是为了适应他们的叙事并确保我的合作而包装的，但其中确实有一些真实的元素。我知道这个种族可能是什么样子。我知道人类可以是美妙的、充满爱和关怀的，但我也知道它可以是黑暗、严酷和残忍的。我也知道，对某些人来说，接受是有其极限的。

"Kaworu I..." Shinji starts to speak as soon as we enter the elevator. He was mostly quiet for the journey here but I know he has been deep in thought the entire time. Knowing what I do, I expect him to be finding some way to place the blame on himself for Asuka's actions, "Is this... my fault?"  
“薰，我...”我们一进电梯，真嗣就开始说话了。他来这里的路上大部分时间都很安静，但我知道他一直在深思熟虑。根据我所知道的，我预计他会找到某种方式将明日香的行为归咎于自己，“这是...我的错吗？”

I shake my head, "No Shinji, it is not your fault. You should not blame yourself for this. Asuka's actions are her own, not any fault of mine nor any fault of yours."  
我摇摇头，“不，真嗣，这不是你的错。你不应该为此自责。明日香的行为是她自己的选择，不是我的错，也不是你的错。”

"But..." “但是……”

"No buts Shinji." I quickly cut him off, "You need to cast those thoughts aside, you are blameless tonight. Instead we should focus on supporting Asuka."  
“没有但是，真嗣。”我迅速打断他，“你需要抛开这些想法，今晚你并无过失。相反，我们应该集中精力支持明日香。”

The elevator reaches the floor with mine and Asuka's room just as I finish speaking. I quickly step out as soon as the door opens and begin to move down the corridor towards the room. My heart is about ready to burst through my chest as we reach the room and I slide the card into the socket. My hand rests on the handle as I realize this is the moment it all changes, this is the moment we've been waiting for.  
电梯在我话音刚落时到达了我与明日香的房间所在的楼层。门一开，我迅速迈出，沿着走廊向房间走去。我的心几乎要跳出胸膛，当我们到达房间时，我将卡片插入插槽。手放在门把手上，我意识到这一刻一切都将改变，这是我们一直等待的时刻。

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I try to shake off the little feelings of annoyance within me as I watch the car pull away with Shinji and Kaworu in it. Strangely I'm not too annoyed at what Asuka has done, it's more the fact that I was wrong about it. When Kaworu came to me and told me that he expected something like this to happen I was... certain it would not. I was wrong... and I am annoyed that I was wrong.  
我试图摆脱内心那一点点恼怒，看着载有真嗣和薰的车驶离。奇怪的是，我对明日香所做的事并不太生气，更多的是因为我错了。当薰来找我，告诉我他预料到会发生这样的事时，我...确信不会发生。我错了...而我恼怒于自己的错误。

Pride... it is another human thing that I seem to have inherited over the last few years. Tonight, my pride is somewhat wounded, I was convinced that Asuka would not do such a thing, that perhaps she had changed enough to not repeat a mistake from long ago. It turns out that my friend is both predictable and an idiot. I should really have expected it.  
骄傲...这是我在过去几年中似乎继承的另一个人类特质。今晚，我的骄傲有些受伤，我深信明日香不会做出这样的事，也许她已经改变到足以不再重复很久以前的错误。事实证明，我的朋友既可预测又是个傻瓜。我真的应该预料到这一点。

Kaworu saw it coming though, perhaps I should give him more credit than I have done. I was surprised when he came to me earlier today and told me about his expectations for tonight. For someone so... so... Kaworu, I was not expecting him to be as perceptive as he was. It turns out he is full of surprises and the more he surprises me, the more certain I am that the three of them can and will be happy.  
尽管如此，卡沃鲁似乎早已预见，或许我应该给予他比以往更多的认可。今天早些时候，他来找我，向我透露了他对今晚的期待，这让我颇为惊讶。对于如此...如此...卡沃鲁的他，我没想到他会如此敏锐。事实证明，他充满了惊喜，而他带给我的惊喜越多，我就越确信他们三人能够并且将会幸福。

"I saw Kaworu and Shinji leaving, is everything okay?"  
“我看到卡沃鲁和真嗣离开了，一切都还好吗？”

I turn around to see Kodama standing at the entrance. I quickly move up and wrap my arms around her, greeting her with a kiss. I nod as I look down the road in the direction of the car, "It is fine. Asuka... tried to run away, they are both going after her."  
我转过身，看到科达玛站在入口处。我迅速上前，用双臂环抱住她，以一个吻迎接她。我点头望向道路尽头的车子方向，“没事的。明日香...试图逃跑，他们俩都去追她了。”

Kodama's smile turns to a concerned frown, she steps out onto the street, "She tried to run? What happened? Should we do anything?"  
小灵的微笑转为担忧的皱眉，她走到街上，“她试图逃跑？发生了什么？我们该怎么办？”

"No, I think those two will be fine." I quickly answer to reassure her, "Nothing actually happened. It is just Asuka being... Asuka. I think tonight was... a lot for her to take in and drew out a lot of her anxieties again."  
“不，我想那两个人会没事的。”我迅速回答以安抚她，“实际上什么都没发生。只是明日香……还是那个明日香。我想今晚对她来说……信息量太大，再次勾起了她的许多焦虑。”

Kodama gives me a nod. She already knows the story about Asuka leaving in the past and should have a good idea of just what Asuka can be like. The look of concern does not leave her face though, "What about Kaworu, how is he taking it?"  
小灵点点头。她已经知道明日香过去离开的故事，应该对明日香的性格有所了解。但担忧的神情并未从她脸上消失，“那渚薰呢，他怎么应对？”

"Kaworu expected it to happen." Kodama actually looks surprised, I suppose she, much like me, did not expect him to be quite as perceptive as he was, "I was surprised too, but he came to speak to me earlier today. He thoguht she might try to run, so he had me keep an eye on her. He's taken Shinji to speak to her now."  
"Kaworu 早料到会这样。" Kodama 看起来真的很惊讶，我想她和我一样，没想到他会如此敏锐，"我也感到意外，但他今天早些时候来找我谈过。他认为她可能会试图逃跑，所以让我盯着她。他现在带着 Shinji 去找她谈话了。"

"So is he going to..." Kodama starts to grin, "Well... you know... will the three of them..."  
"那他打算..." Kodama 开始露出笑容，"嗯...你知道的...他们三个会不会..."

"I hope so." I answer, "Asuka seems to believe Kaworu and Shinji have a stronger bond and that she would only end up hurting Kaworu int he long run because of who she is. Kaworu can... hopefully make her see otherwise. I just hope they don't... fuck this up."  
"我希望如此。" 我回答，"Asuka 似乎认为 Kaworu 和 Shinji 之间有更强的羁绊，而她自己最终只会因为她的性格而伤害到 Kaworu。希望 Kaworu 能...让她看到不同的结果。我只希望他们不要...搞砸这一切。"

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

I open the door to our room and my mind begins to go over the parallels with this moment and the events of five years ago. I didn't quite understand what I was feeling at the time but I was so very nervous then as well. I knew that as I opened the door to that chamber everything, for better or worse, was going to change. Perhaps my heart didn't quite pound like it is now and my hands weren't as sweaty as they are now but those overwhelming feelings of unease and uncertainty are definitely akin to what I'm feeling now.  
我推开我们房间的门，思绪开始在此时此刻与五年前的事件之间寻找相似之处。那时我并不完全明白自己的感受，但同样非常紧张。我知道，当我打开那扇门时，无论好坏，一切都将改变。也许我的心跳没有现在这么剧烈，手也没有现在这么湿，但那种强烈的不安和不确定感，确实与我现在的心情相似。

_Am I doing the right thing?  
我这样做对吗？_

Us humans... We move in patterns and cycles. The situations and scenarios ahead of us may change but our approach tends to be similar. We play things out in a similar fashion and repeat patterns from before, despite perhaps knowing it may not be the best approach. There does always come a time when we have to break that cycle. For better or worse we need to break the cycles which will of course lead to entering a new one.  
我们人类……总是按照模式和周期行事。前方的情境和场景或许会改变，但我们的应对方式往往相似。我们以类似的方式行事，重复过去的模式，尽管可能知道这并非最佳方法。总会有那么一个时刻，我们必须打破这个循环。无论结果如何，我们需要打破那些注定会进入新循环的旧模式。

Asuka... In a way she is coming full circle tonight. Right now, she is in the process of repeating an action she took many years ago. Running away because of her own fear of abandonment. Escaping because she feels she is unworthy of my love and frightened that she will only hurt others. Together, me and Shinji can stop her from doing this and break this cycle.  
明日香...某种程度上，她今晚正经历着一个完整的循环。此刻，她正重复多年前的一个行为：因害怕被抛弃而逃跑。逃离，因为她觉得自己不配得到我的爱，害怕只会伤害他人。我和真嗣可以一起阻止她这样做，打破这个循环。

Me opening this door, this is an action I took many years ago. I opened a doorway into uncertainty so many years ago and did not know what the consequences would be. I'm doing that now, I know what I want to happen but those little feelings of doubt are creeping in. I know it isn't quite the same, this isn't going to end the world but... it is the end of something and the dawn of something else.  
我打开这扇门，这是多年前我采取的一个行动。多年前，我打开了一扇通往未知的大门，不知道会有什么后果。现在我正在这么做，我知道我希望发生什么，但那些小小的疑虑正在悄悄潜入。我知道这并不完全相同，这不会终结世界，但...这是某件事的结束，也是另一件事的开始。

Shinji... I wonder if tonight has perhaps led to him breaking one of his own cycles. He told me that he had some important news for both myself and Asuka. Perhaps that is the breaking of a cycle for him, perhaps that is him moving beyond a pattern he is repeating.  
真嗣...我不知道今晚是否让他打破了自己的一个循环。他告诉我，他有一些重要消息要告诉我和明日香。也许这对他来说是一个循环的打破，也许是他超越了一个重复的模式。

I can see straight into the bedroom as I enter the corridor. Just as I expected, Asuka is stood there and is hastily stuffing her things into one of our cases. I quickly move into the room with Shinji close behind me. Asuka spots me straight away and her body stiffens, her eyes dart from me to Shinji and then back to me, widening with fear as she tightens her grip on the garments in her hand. I would laugh at the situation, eying the bunches of underwear she now drops to the ground but this is serious.  
我一走进走廊就能直接看到卧室。正如我所料，明日香站在那里，正急忙将她的东西塞进我们其中一个箱子里。我迅速走进房间，真嗣紧随其后。明日香立刻发现了我，她的身体僵硬起来，眼睛从我身上转到真嗣，再转回我，随着她手中衣物握得更紧，她的眼睛因恐惧而睁大。我本可以嘲笑这个情景，看着她现在掉落在地的一堆内衣，但这是严肃的。

I wonder if the two of them can hear my heart pounding rapidly in my chest or the sound of me swallowing as I try to figure out what to say. I had this all mapped out moments ago but now... it's gone.  
我不知道他们俩是否能听到我胸中急速跳动的心脏声，或是我试图想出该说什么时吞咽的声音。刚才这一切我都计划好了，但现在...一切都消失了。

"Go away." She hisses angrily at the pair of us."  
“走开。”她生气地对我们俩低声咆哮。

"No." I state as firmly as I can, standing my ground and hoping that Shinji is still behind me, "You're not leaving Asuka."  
"不行。" 我尽可能坚定地说道，坚守立场，并希望真嗣仍在我身后，"你不能离开明日香。"

"I will do what I want to do." She snaps back, slamming the case lid down, "Now both of you, go away."  
"我想做什么就做什么。" 她厉声回击，砰地一声关上箱子盖，"现在你们两个，走开。"

"No." I repeat as I take another step towards the bed, she shoots me a glare that stops me in my tracks and I suddenly realize something. I don't know what to do if she does try to leave. I can't exactly grab hold of her and restrain her nor would I expect Shinji to do the same. I cannot force her to do something here, so I have to say the right things and... I have to say it quickly, "I know why you're leaving Asuka and... You don't have to leave... Please, don't hurt yourself like this."  
"不行。" 我重复着，又向床边迈了一步，她投来一个足以让我停下脚步的锐利目光，我突然意识到一件事。如果她真的试图离开，我不知道该怎么办。我不能真的抓住她并限制她的行动，也不指望真嗣会这么做。我无法强迫她在这里做些什么，所以我必须说对的话，而且...我必须说得快，"我知道你为什么要离开明日香，而且...你不必离开...请不要这样伤害自己。"

"You know why I'm leaving?" Hah, well isn't Angel-boy perceptive all of a sudden?" She tries to add some venom to her voice this time but I can hear the lack of meaning underneath it. I ignore the weak attempt to insult me, "Well then you should know that I'm doing this for you! I'm doing this so that you can be happy! Both of you you're... better off without me."  
"你知道我为什么要走吗？"哈，天使小子突然变得这么敏锐？"她这次试图在声音中加入一些毒液，但我能听出其中的空洞。我无视了这微弱的侮辱尝试，"那么你应该知道我这么做是为了你！我这么做是为了让你能幸福！你们俩……没有我，会过得更好。"

"Asuka you know that isn't true!" I answer her back, "I love you... You leaving wouldn't make me happy."  
"明日香，你知道那不是真的！"我回答她，"我爱你……你离开不会让我快乐。"

"I... don't want you to leave either Asuka." I hear Shinji speaking from behind me. Hearing his voices surprises me but also fills me full of relief, I am so thankful that he has found his voice, "You... shouldn't leave... I know what you're going through... I..."  
"我……也不想你离开，明日香。"我听到真嗣从背后说话。听到他的声音让我惊讶，但也充满了宽慰，我非常感激他找到了自己的声音，"你……不应该离开……我知道你在经历什么……我……"

"You have no idea what I'm going through Shinji! You-"  
"你根本不知道我经历了什么，真嗣！你——"

"Yes! I do!" Shinji interrupts her raising his voice, which catches both me and her off guard, I remain silent as I listen to him continue, "You're scared of hurting us because you've hurt people in the past! You're scared of letting yourself be loved because you think people will just betray you or abandon you! You think you should be left all alone because you're worthless! You're the same as me Asuka! You know this and you know fine well none of it is true!"  
"是的！我知道！"真嗣提高嗓门打断了她，这让我们俩都措手不及，我保持沉默，听着他继续说道，"你害怕伤害我们，因为你过去伤害过别人！你害怕接受爱，因为你认为人们会背叛你或抛弃你！你认为自己应该被孤立，因为你觉得自己毫无价值！你和我一样，明日香！你知道这一点，你也清楚这些都不是真的！"

I remain silent as I look at the look of recognition on her face and then back to the emotion on Shinji's face.  
我保持沉默，看着她脸上露出的认同表情，然后又看向真嗣脸上的情感。

"I want to run away from everything as well Asuka... I was terrified of what would happen when I saw the two of you step off that plane. I was terrified of what would happen when I spoke to you again. I was terrified of tonight because I thought one person in that audience would know the truth about who I was and what I had done. I'm always scared of myself, of people I don't know and the people I do know. I'm frightened all the time and I hate it."  
"我也想逃离这一切，明日香……当看到你们俩走下飞机时，我害怕会发生什么。再次与你交谈时，我害怕会发生什么。我害怕今晚，因为我认为观众中会有一个人知道关于我是谁以及我做过什么的真相。我总是害怕自己，害怕我不认识的人和我认识的人。我时时刻刻都感到恐惧，我讨厌这样。"

"Shinji, you ha-" "真嗣，你害——"

"I hate it all just like you probably do! It's tiring, sometimes I'm exhausted in the middle of the day just because of it all! I hate feeling it so much and want to change it but running away isn't the answer and our past doesn't dictate who we are now and who we will be. Deep down I know... I deserve friends and I deserve to be loved!"  
"我讨厌这一切，就像你可能讨厌的那样！这很累人，有时候我会在中午就感到筋疲力尽，就是因为这一切！我讨厌这种感觉，想要改变它，但逃避不是答案，我们的过去并不决定我们现在是谁以及我们将成为谁。在内心深处我知道……我值得拥有朋友，我值得被爱！"

I had no idea all of this was within Shinji's heart, nor did I think he was capable of expressing it like this. His words are... inspirational and I suppress smiling at hearing the passion within him. Shinji is a truly wonderful man, amazing. I look towards Asuka and see her trying to form some sort of response to what he has said. I take this as my time to jump in.  
我从未意识到这一切深藏在真嗣的心中，也未曾想过他能如此表达。他的话语充满鼓舞，我强忍着不因他内心的激情而微笑。真嗣真是一个了不起的人，令人惊叹。我望向明日香，见她正试图组织语言回应他的话。我抓住这个时机插话。

"Asuka I... I know you're scared of hurting me in the future and I know you're scared of me hurting you in some way. I understand that because I'm frightened of those things too, I don't want to be abandoned and alone but I know it's just fear speaking and not reality." I take a deep breath, "We're all scared of the same thing Asuka, we're all thinking and feeling the same things but... don't you two see. None of us have to be left behind, there is a bond between us all... a chance that we can... we can seize."  
“明日香，我……我知道你害怕将来会伤害我，也知道你担心我会以某种方式伤害你。我理解这些，因为我也害怕这些事情，我不想被抛弃和孤独，但我知道这只是恐惧在说话，并非现实。”我深吸一口气，“我们都在害怕同样的事情，明日香，我们都在思考和感受同样的东西，但是……你们俩难道看不出来吗？我们没有人必须被抛下，我们之间有一种纽带……一个我们可以抓住的机会。”

The two of them remain silent as I say those words, pretty much as I expected them to. I can see them both thinking about it but neither of them wanting to ask me what I meant. Instead they just exchange glances.  
我说完这些话后，他们俩都沉默了，正如我所预料的那样。我能看出他们都在思考，但谁也不想问我是什么意思。相反，他们只是交换了一下眼神。

"Shinji... Can I ask you something, please... be honest with me. Do you love Asuka?" Shinji looks at Asuka and I see the spark between them as their eyes meet. He turns to me again and I simply nod my head, "Don't worry about hurting me Shinji, be honest."  
"真嗣...我能问你一件事吗，请诚实地回答我。你爱明日香吗？" 真嗣看着明日香，我看到他们目光交汇时闪现的火花。他再次转向我，我只是点点头，"别担心会伤害我，真嗣，说实话。"

"Yes, I do." He answers me immediately.  
"是的，我爱她。" 他立刻回答我。

I nod again and feel some relief at his admission, "Asuka... I ask you the same thing. Do you love Shinji? Again... be honest."  
我再次点头，对他的坦白感到一丝宽慰，"明日香...我也问你同样的问题。你爱真嗣吗？同样...请诚实回答。"

"Hah, love Shinji? You must be-" I narrow my eyes at her as she begins her bravado led tired, she instantly stops at the sight of the glare I give her and the look of hurt on Shinji's face, "Okay I... yes but-"  
"哈哈，喜欢真嗣？你一定是——" 我眯起眼睛盯着她，她开始用疲惫的勇气说话，但一看到我给她的瞪视和真嗣脸上的受伤表情，她立刻停了下来，"好吧我...是的但是——"

"Say nothing else!" I quickly stop her, "You do love me as well though, don't you?"  
"别再说别的了！" 我迅速制止她，"不过你也爱我，对吧？"

She nods her head, "Yes, I do."  
她点点头，"是的，我爱。"

I now look at Shinji again, "Shinji... How do you feel about me? Again, please be honest. I know that there are circumstances that might make it awkward but... be honest."  
我又一次看向真嗣，“真嗣……你对我感觉如何？请再次诚实地告诉我。我知道有些情况可能会让这变得尴尬，但……请诚实回答。”

"I love you." He answers almost instantly, surprisingly so. I didn't quite expect him to be so honest and upfront.  
“我爱你。”他几乎立刻回答，这出乎意料地坦率。我没想到他会如此诚实和直接。

"Okay and... I love both of you as well." I add, So... don't the two of you see? We can... all be together, the three of us. If we all love each other then... shouldn't we allow that to happen? Allow ourselves to be together?"  
“好吧，而且……我也爱你们两个。”我补充道，“所以……你们俩不觉得吗？我们可以……三个人在一起。如果我们彼此相爱，那么……我们不应该允许这种情况发生吗？允许我们在一起？”

"You mean... all three of us in the same relationship?" Asuka looks at me, with some disbelief on her face.  
"你是说...我们三个在同一个关系里？" 明日香看着我，脸上带着些许难以置信。

"Yes." I nod, "Exactly that!"  
"是的。" 我点头，"正是如此！"

"But that... isn't normal Kaworu!" She offers somewhat weakly.  
"但那...那不正常啊，薰！" 她有些无力地说道。

"Asuka... I'm technically a clone of an entity that was sent to this planet millions upon millions of years ago by some ancestral race by a race of beings that doesn't exist anymore. I was raised in isolation by the leader of a cult whose aim was to reduce humanity to nothing and force their own evolution because of some misguided belief that this wonderful species had reached its peak. What 'normal' might be, I have never known it nor have I ever needed it." I answer her with a simple shrug, "I am in love with the two of you, and that feeling is amazing. I don't care if it isn't 'normal', to hell with normal, if we are happy then... who cares?"  
"明日香...从技术上讲，我是某个实体的克隆体，这个实体是由一个早已不复存在的祖先种族在亿万年前派遣到这个星球上的。我在孤立中被一个邪教领袖抚养长大，他们的目标是让人类化为乌有，并强迫他们进化，因为他们误以为这个美妙的物种已经达到了顶峰。我从未知道，也从未需要过什么是'正常'。" 我简单地耸了耸肩回答她，"我爱你们两个，这种感觉很美妙。我不在乎这是否'正常'，去他的正常，如果我们幸福的话...谁在乎呢？"

Her eyes lower to the ground and then over to Shinji, "What about you... what do you think?"  
她的目光低垂到地面，然后转向真嗣，"你呢...你怎么想？"

"I... Asuka is right Kaworu... it isn't normal." Shinji answers her, "But you're right too... You've never known normal and neither have we. Those things that happened to us, the things we had to face... it wasn't normal but it all happened. This might not be normal but I'd... much rather be happen then not."  
"我...明日香说得对，渚薰...这不正常。" 真嗣回答她，"但你也是对的...你从未知道过正常，我们也没有。那些发生在我们身上的事，我们必须面对的事情...虽然不正常，但它们确实发生了。这可能不正常，但我宁愿发生，也不愿没有。"

Once again, our eyes go towards Asuka and await her response. She has one hand on the suitcase and another down by her side. I watch as she continuously clenches it into a fist and unclenches it a number of times before nodding, "I need... this is a lot to take in... the two fo you? I... I mean I'd just have two people to hurt! You both know... Shinji, you know better than anything what I'm like... I..."  
我们的目光再次转向明日香，等待她的回应。她一手放在行李箱上，另一只手垂在身侧。我看着她不停地握紧拳头又松开，反复多次后才点头，“我需要……这太突然了……你们两个？我……我是说，我只需要伤害两个人！你们都知道……真嗣，你比任何人都了解我是什么样的人……我……”

"Asuka! That was five years ago!" Shinji cuts her off with his voice raised again, "Stop being such an idiot about it! You're not that girl anymore and that was... that was never really who you were. You're a kind person... You're compassionate and you push us to be better. I know who the real you is and it isn't who you keep saying it is!"  
“明日香！那是五年前的事了！”真嗣再次提高声音打断她，“别再那么傻了！你已经不是那个女孩了，那从来就不是真正的你。你是个善良的人……你富有同情心，激励我们变得更好。我知道真正的你是谁，那不是你一直所说的那样！”

"Kaworu..." “薰……”

I shake my head, "Shinji is right. Remember how the night you met me? Remember how you were when I got attacked? Remember what you told me about the children's wards, the donations and signed copies for free? That's the Asuka I know and there is no trace of this person you keep talking about. There never has been and I don't think that person exists."  
我摇摇头，“真嗣说得对。还记得我们相遇的那个夜晚吗？还记得我被袭击时你的样子吗？还记得你告诉我的关于儿童病房、捐赠和签名书免费的事吗？那才是我认识的明日香，你一直在说的那个人，我一点痕迹都没发现。从来就没有过，我也不认为那个人存在。”

Silence falls again as we await her response, I continue to take deep breaths, my heart still pounding but my thoughts clearer. I look towards Asuka and see the emotion in her eyes, I see the faint form of tears in the corners and her rapid blinking as she tries to force them away. I was right, this is the moment, just a little bit more.  
我们再次陷入沉默，等待她的回应，我继续深呼吸，心跳依旧剧烈但思绪更加清晰。我望向明日香，看到她眼中的情感，看到眼角隐约的泪光和她试图眨眼驱散的急促。我没错，就是这一刻，再坚持一会儿。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

_Yes!_

_Yes!_

_Oh god yes! 哦，天哪，没错！_

_Say yes you goddamn idiot! You know how you feel about the two of them so just agree to it! Say yes! Don't fuck this up! Don't let this slip away!  
说你他妈的同意啊！你知道你对他们俩的感觉，就干脆答应吧！说好！别搞砸了！别让这机会溜走！_

Any words I could possibly say are stuck in my throat as I try to blink away the tears forming in my eyes at hearing what the two of them have to say about me. I... believe it but I don't believe it, I can't believe it because I have this horrible mental blockage that prevents it but I know... I know somewhere that it's true. They wouldn't say it if it wasn't.  
任何我能说出口的话都卡在喉咙里，我试图眨掉眼眶中因听到他们对我评价而涌出的泪水。我...相信又不敢相信，我无法相信，因为有个可怕的心理障碍阻止我接受，但我知道...我内心某处知道那是真的。如果不是真的，他们不会这么说。

Still, that other voice persists. Telling me that it's only temporary, that their positive feelings towards me won't last and in time it'll fall apart. That eventually, I'll just reveal myself to be what I think I am, this horrible bitch that fucks everything up. Shinji, you were so goddamn right, this bullshit is exhausting, I'm so sick and tired of being tired.  
然而，那个声音依然挥之不去。告诉我这只是暂时的，他们对我的好感不会持久，最终一切都会分崩离析。总有一天，我会暴露出自己认为的真实面目，那个毁掉一切的可怕婊子。真嗣，你说得太对了，这些破事真让人筋疲力尽，我厌倦了这种疲惫不堪的生活。

This thing Kaworu has said, the three of us being together in a relationship, it sounds perfect. It sounds like a dream scenario and I am wondering if maybe I did fall asleep and this is a dream. I quickly clench my hand into a fist, digging my nails into the palm to elicit some pain. No... this isn't a dream. This is reality so then... it must be some sort of joke.  
碇真嗣所说的，我们三个人在一起的关系，听起来完美无缺。仿佛是梦境中的理想场景，我不禁怀疑自己是否真的睡着了，这一切只是梦。我迅速握紧拳头，用指甲刺入掌心以感受疼痛。不...这不是梦。这是现实，那么...这一定是个玩笑。

I look around the room for the cables leading to the hidden cameras. I listen out for the shuffling by the door where the presenter of some tacky show waits, ready to burst in. I stem those thoughts, what sort of prank would that be?  
我在房间里寻找隐藏摄像头的线路。我留意着门口的动静，期待某个俗气的节目主持人随时冲进来。我抑制了这些想法，那会是怎样的恶作剧呢？

This is reality, those two men in front of me are deadly serious about this and I'm the one they're waiting on. Is this really what I want? Yes, it really is but fear is holding me back. The same fears that made me leave Japan, the same fears that made me stay away for five years, the same fears that threatened to not let me fall in love with Kaworu.  
这是现实，面前的这两个人对此事极为认真，而我正是他们等待的那个人。这真的是我想要的吗？是的，确实如此，但恐惧让我退缩。正是同样的恐惧让我离开日本，让我五年不敢回来，也是这些恐惧让我几乎无法爱上渚薰。

New fears enter the fray, will they just realize they're better off without me anyway and abandon me some time down the line? Will I take them for granted and revert into being some sort of monster? What if two of us argues? How will that be handled? Will we live together? I have doubts and questions and I need answers.  
新的恐惧涌入战场，他们会不会最终意识到没有我反而更好，从而在某一刻抛弃我？我会不会把他们视为理所当然，变回某种怪物？如果我们两人发生争执怎么办？那将如何处理？我们会住在一起吗？我满怀疑虑和问题，我需要答案。

Shinji or Kaworu haven't moved in all the time I've been thinking about this. Shinji awkwardly shuffles from one foot to the other. Kaworu on the other hand keeps his eyes on me, awaiting my response. Shinji has already given his response it seems; he is all for it. It's uncharacteristically decisive of him but then... the adrenaline from the performance is probably coursing through him still.  
在我思考这些的时候，真嗣和薰一直没有动。真嗣尴尬地左右挪动着脚。而薰则一直注视着我，等待我的回应。真嗣似乎已经给出了他的答案；他完全支持。这对他来说是不寻常的果断，但随后...表演带来的肾上腺素可能仍在他的体内涌动。

My mind flashes back to the near kiss from just the other night. If I say yes then I could have that... I could have that and so much more. I could have Shinji and Kaworu together, we could all kiss and make love and be together. There would be no guilt and no shame... So why am I still hesitating?  
我的思绪闪回到前几晚那个几乎吻上的瞬间。如果我说是，那么我就能拥有那个...我不仅能拥有那个，还能拥有更多。我可以和真嗣、薰在一起，我们可以亲吻、做爱、在一起。不会有愧疚，也不会有羞耻...那我为什么还在犹豫呢？

"I..." I start to try to say something, desperate to end the awkward silence in the room but I'm not really sure what I could say. I look Kaworu in the eye and then turn to Shinji, before looking at Kaworu again, "...Are the two of you... really... serious about this?"  
"我..." 我试图说些什么，迫切想要打破房间里的尴尬沉默，但我并不确定该说什么。我直视着渚薰的眼睛，然后转向真嗣，再次看向渚薰，"...你们俩...真的...是认真的吗？"

Kaworu nods firmly, "Yes... I am."  
渚薰坚定地点头，"是的...我是认真的。"

I turn towards Shinji and he also nods, "I... Yes, I would like it as well."  
我转向真嗣，他也点头，"我...是的，我也希望如此。"

I let out a sigh, I want to say yes but now my mind has turned to other details. I look at Kaworu again, "And you have... thought about this, how it would work... I mean?"  
我叹了口气，想说好，但此刻思绪已转向其他细节。我又看向渚薰，“而你已经……考虑过这个，它是如何运作的……我是说？”

"A little bit." He admits, "Granted I have not quite worked out everything, I felt it would be unfair to plan too much should you both decide to not go ahead and even if you did, I would rather have your input on how to proceed. After all if we are to be in a relationship we should all have a say, should we not?"  
“有一点。”他承认道，“当然，我并没有完全规划好一切，我觉得如果你们决定不继续，计划太多就不公平了。即使你们同意，我也更希望听到你们的意见，如何推进。毕竟，如果我们打算建立关系，我们都应该有发言权，不是吗？”

It makes me feel slightly better that Kaworu has at least thought about options and didn't just expect us to say yes. He must have considered that things would not be so simple with Shinji living in Japan and both myself and Kaworu being in Germany.  
这让我感觉稍好一些，至少渚薰考虑过一些方案，并没有直接期待我们答应。他一定考虑到了，事情不会那么简单，因为真嗣住在日本，而我和渚薰都在德国。

"Good." I answer him, "So you know... the distance would be an issue. Both of you know this right?"  
"好。" 我回答他，"所以你知道...距离会是个问题。你们俩都清楚这一点，对吧？"

Kaworu nods and Shinji looks at me, "I... forgot..."  
渚薰点点头，真嗣看着我，"我...忘了..."

"Idiot." I let out a laugh, "Just like you... jumping into a situation without thinking about it. It's a good thing you would have people like me to think about it for you."  
"笨蛋。" 我笑出声来，"就像你一样...一头扎进情况里，不考虑后果。还好有像我这样的人替你考虑。"

"So, is it a yes?" Kaworu asks me, I feel my heart start to thump in my chest.  
“那么，是同意吗？” 渚薰问我，我感觉自己的心跳开始在胸腔中加速。

"We need to work things out first Kaworu I... can't just say yes like that. We leave Japan in a few days remember, so what would we do? Bring Shinji back with us, you can't quite do that can you?" I look towards Shinji, "And Kaworu... we can't just come back here at will. There is a process, you know that. Plus, you... have a job."  
“我们得先理清一些事情，渚薰，我……不能就这样轻易答应。我们几天后就要离开日本了，记得吗？那我们该怎么办？把真嗣带回去，你不能那么做，对吧？” 我看向真嗣，“而且，渚薰……我们不能随意回来。你知道有程序要走的。另外，你……还有工作。”

Kaworu nods, "I know, I had thought about that."  
渚薰点头，“我知道，我考虑过这些。”

"If we do this..." I begin, "We do it properly, I want the two of you properly and I want the two of you to have me completely."  
"如果我们这么做..." 我开始说道，"我们要做得妥当，我希望你们俩都认真对待，我也希望你们俩能完全拥有我。"

I suddenly trail off realizing what I have just said, I see Kaworu raise his eyebrow slightly, Shinji looks off into the corner.  
我突然停了下来，意识到自己刚刚说了什么，我看到渚薰微微挑起眉毛，真嗣则望向角落。

"Perverts!" I snarl at them, "You both know what I meant! I just mean... I don't want anyone left behind, it's a proper relationship, not two people and their... part time lover."  
"变态！" 我朝他们咆哮，"你们俩都知道我的意思！我只是说...我不想有人被落下，这是一段认真的关系，不是两个人和他们的...兼职情人。"

"I... understand." Kaworu nods again, "I would not be happy with that either, I know the situation is slightly more complicated than it seems. I want the same as well and I'm sure Shinji would want the same."  
"我...理解。" 渚薰再次点头，"如果换作是我，也不会感到高兴，我知道情况比表面上看起来要复杂一些。我也希望如此，我相信真嗣也会这么想。"

Shinji looks at the two of us and also nods his head to confirm, "Yes, I want that as well."  
真嗣看着我们俩，也点头确认道："是的，我也希望这样。"

"Honestly I don't quite know how we would sort it out yet." Kaworu admits, "Like I said, I thought it would be unfair to assume what either of you would want to do. I had... considered a few things and now that I know both of your feelings I could... look into that. If you will both allow me a bit of time, I can do that, it might also be good for the two of you to talk about this."  
"老实说，我还不完全清楚我们该如何解决这个问题。" 渚薰承认道，"就像我之前说的，我认为假设你们俩想要做什么是不公平的。我之前...考虑过一些方案，现在了解了你们俩的想法后，我可以...去研究一下。如果你们俩能给我一点时间，我可以去做这件事，你们俩也可以好好谈谈这件事。"

I nod back at him and watch as he moves out of the room, immediately I wonder just what he might have considered. Fact is, Kaworu has two jobs now, one of them as a piano teacher and the other working for Fuyutsuki. I know him, he can't just go back on either of those now, so that means Shinji will have to come to Germany.  
我朝他点点头，看着他走出房间，立刻开始琢磨他可能考虑了些什么。事实是，渚薰现在有两份工作，一份是钢琴教师，另一份是为冬月工作。我了解他，他不可能放弃其中任何一个，这意味着真嗣必须来德国。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

"So, what do you think Shinji?" Asuka looks at me after Kaworu leaves the room, "Any suggestions?"  
“那么，真嗣，你怎么看？”渚薰离开房间后，明日香看着我问道，“有什么建议吗？”

I shake my head as I feel my heart pounding in my chest. Kaworu's words and admission... Asuka's admission... both are things I never expected to happen. What Kaworu has suggested is not something I had thought of either. Maybe... a certain type of fantasy here and there but I didn't think we could have a relationship. Yet, the more I think about it the more I want it and the surer I am that it is the right thing to do.  
我摇摇头，感觉心脏在胸腔里狂跳。渚薰的话和他的坦白……明日香的坦白……都是我从未预料到的事情。渚薰提出的建议，我也没有想过。或许……偶尔会有某种幻想，但我从未想过我们能建立关系。然而，我越是思考，就越渴望它，也越确信这是正确的选择。

"S-Suggestions?" I ask. "建议？" 我问道。

"Yeah... For how to sort this out of course!" She answers, "You do want this, right?"  
"是的... 关于如何解决这个问题，当然！" 她回答，"你确实想要这样，对吧？"

I nod, "Y-Yes... I do. I meant what I said I love you both and... I want to be with you both."  
我点头，"是的... 我确实。我说的是真心话，我爱你们两个，而且... 我想和你们两个在一起。"

Suggestions... I suppose for how we would work in this relationship. I guess I got carried away by the fantasy side of it, my mind fast forwarded to scenarios where I'm cooking dinner for the two of them, where they play me their favourite music and we sit on the sofa watching movies. I never thought about the reality of it, and that is that Kaworu and Asuka live in a country very far from here.  
关于我们如何维系这段关系的建议...我想我被幻想的一面冲昏了头脑，脑海中迅速跳跃到我为他们俩做饭的场景，他们为我播放最喜欢的音乐，我们一起坐在沙发上看电影。我从未考虑过现实，那就是渚薰和明日香住在离这里非常遥远的国度。

"Bit unfair though isn't it... us being the couple in Germany and you being like an obedient pet, waiting for us to visit you or for you to come out and visit us?" She lets out a sigh and walks around to my side of the bed, "Can't really expect you to just ditch everything here and move to Germany with us though, I mean for one... you don't speak the language and for two, I can't imagine you leaving Rei and Misato behind."  
不过这有点不公平，不是吗...我们在德国成双成对，而你就像个乖巧的宠物，等待我们来访或你来探望我们？"她叹了口气，绕到我床的这一边，"当然不能指望你抛下这里的一切搬来德国和我们一起生活，首先...你不懂德语，其次，我无法想象你会离开丽和美里。

I try to think of a way to protest but Asuka is of course correct, I wouldn't be comfortable leaving the two of them behind, nor my other friends. I rely so much on their support, moving away like that would be crippling for me.  
我试图想出一个反驳的理由，但明日香当然是对的，我无法安心离开她们俩，还有其他朋友。我如此依赖她们的支持，那样搬走对我来说将是毁灭性的打击。

Also... Oh god, I completely forgot! Even if I did want to, I can't leave Japan for the next year anyway! The whole deal with the ensemble is going forward! I'm going to be needed for more rehearsals, more concerts and the recording. I haven't told the two of them yet, I was going to later on but then all of this happened.  
还有...哦天哪，我完全忘了！即便我想，接下来一年我也离不开日本！整个乐团的事宜正在推进！我还需要参加更多排练、更多音乐会和录音。我还没告诉他们俩，原本打算晚点再说，但这一切突然发生了。

I have to tell her now, I take a deep breath, "Actually... it isn't just that. Asuka I... can't really leave Japan for the next year."  
我现在必须告诉她，我深吸一口气，“其实...不只是那样。明日香，我...接下来一年确实离不开日本。”

"At all?" She raises an eyebrow at me, "Why not?"  
“完全不行吗？”她挑眉看着我，“为什么？”

"Well I... guess I could go on holiday but... not for long." I start to explain, "Last week I was... well we all were spoken to by our conductor... he said he had been approached by others who were interested in what we did. They want us to do more shows, record an album and maybe even... television appearances. I already said I'd do it."  
"嗯，我...我想我可以去度假，但...不会太久。"我开始解释，"上周，我们都被指挥官叫去谈话了...他说有人对我们做的事情感兴趣。他们希望我们多演出，录制专辑，甚至可能...上电视。我已经答应了。"

"I see..." She folds her arms as she approaches me, she stops for a brief moment looking me in the eyes before suddenly pulling me into a hug, "Congratulations Shinji, you deserve it."  
"我明白了..."她抱着双臂向我走来，停顿片刻，凝视着我的眼睛，然后突然把我拉进一个拥抱，"恭喜你，真嗣，这是你应得的。"

I'm stunned by her reaction and stand frozen for a moment before putting my arms around her and hugging her back. She releases me from the hug a few seconds later as I look at her in surprise, "Y-You're not mad?"  
我对她的反应感到震惊，一时僵立，片刻后才伸出双臂回抱她。几秒钟后，她松开了拥抱，我惊讶地看着她，"你...你不生气吗？"

She shakes her head, "How could I be? That's incredible new, I'm... really proud of you."  
她摇了摇头，“我怎么可能不高兴呢？这消息太惊人了，我……真的为你感到骄傲。”

"But... I've made things harder." I answer, "If it wasn't for that I could be joining you in Germany and we could... make this work. I mean... you don't want to leave Germany, do you?"  
“但是……我让事情变得更复杂了。”我回答道，“如果不是这样，我本可以和你一起去德国，我们或许……能一起克服这些。我是说……你并不想离开德国，对吧？”

I watch as she shrugs, "I... don't know, being honest there is nothing really tying me to Germany. I'm an author, as long as I have an e-mail address and a word processor, I can do my job. I don't really have any love for Germany so I guess I don't really care if I have to move. Hell, the only reason I went back to Germany in the first place is because they wouldn't let me go anywhere else, it was stay in Japan or go to Germany because my father is here."  
我看着她耸了耸肩，“我……不知道，说实话，德国并没有什么让我留恋的东西。我是个作家，只要有电子邮箱和文字处理软件，我就能工作。我对德国并没有特别的感情，所以我想我并不介意搬走。说起来，我当初回德国只是因为他们不让我去其他地方，要么留在日本，要么去德国，因为我父亲在这里。”

"So, you'd..." "所以，你会..."

"Come back to Japan?" She nods, "Yeah... in an instant, I have nothing really in Germany, there is a nice little café that does a good breakfast but you're here... Rei is here, Hikari is here... what I know the most is here."  
"回到日本吗？" 她点头，"是的...立刻就回来，我在德国其实没什么牵挂，那里有一家不错的小咖啡馆早餐做得很好，但你在这里...丽在这里，光也在这里...我最熟悉的一切都在这里。"

"Kaworu can't though, can he?"  
"但渚薰不行，对吧？"

"He works for Fuyutsuki's office in Germany... He has a job teaching piano at a school in Germany..." Asuka explains, "I guess he can't just drop them."  
"他在德国为冬月先生的办公室工作...还在德国的一所学校教钢琴..." 明日香解释道，"我想他不能就这样放弃。"

"Well could you not just... go back and forth?" I suggest, instantly regretting what I realize is a stupid suggestion the moment it leaves my lips.  
"那你就不能...来回跑吗？" 我提议道，立刻后悔意识到这是一个愚蠢的建议，话一出口我就意识到了。

"What? You mean one month with you and one month with Kaworu?" She questions me, "Shinji, it'll be a relationship not shift work! Besides... It's a three-way relationship, so when would you and Kaworu get time together?"  
"什么？你是说一个月和你在一起，一个月和渚薰在一起？" 她质问我，"真嗣，这可不是轮班工作，是恋爱关系！而且...这是三角关系，你和渚薰什么时候能有时间在一起？"

"I... suppose..." I answer her letting out a sigh, "But... I do want this..."  
"我...我想..." 我回答她，叹了口气，"但是...我确实想要这个..."

"So do I." She states, "We just have to be realistic I guess... it isn't going to be easy. At least... not at first. I just don't want us to jump into this thinking it's going to be one thing and then when reality hits us we get... hurt. We've already been hurt too much... You... Kaworu and me. We're not hurting each other anymore."  
"我也是。" 她说道，"我们只是得现实一点...这不会容易的。至少...一开始不会。我只是不想我们抱着某种想法跳进去，然后现实一击中我们，我们就...受伤。我们已经受够了伤害...你...和真嗣和我。我们不能再互相伤害了。"

As she says this, she reaches her hand up to my face and softly cups my cheek. I allow my head to move towards her hand, feeling its warm and softness as she gently caresses me. I feel the butterflies in my stomach start to flutter as we stand silent, looking into one another eyes. I slowly start to reach my own hand up to her cheek, resting it and gently stroking my fingers along her soft skin.  
当她说这话时，她伸手抚上我的脸颊，轻轻地托住。我让我的头向她的手靠去，感受着它的温暖和柔软，她温柔地抚摸着我。我感到胃里的蝴蝶开始飞舞，我们静静地站着，凝视着彼此的眼睛。我慢慢地抬起自己的手，放在她的脸颊上，轻轻地抚摸着她柔软的皮肤。

"Asuka... If I have to wait a few months to be with the two of you properly." I begin to speak, "Or if I can only be with you both for a short time every so often then... I don't mind."  
"明日香... 如果我必须等待几个月才能与你们俩正常相处。" 我开始说话，"或者如果我只能偶尔与你们俩短暂相聚，那么... 我并不介意。"

"Shinji... how could you be okay with that?"  
"真嗣... 你怎么能接受那样的情况呢？"

"I'd waited five years to see you both again." I answer, "I never thought I'd see you again, never mind Kaworu. I wouldn't... like it but if that was the way we could all be together at least... for now then, I'll do it."  
"我等了五年才再次见到你们俩。" 我回答，"我从未想过会再见到你们，更不用说渚薰了。我不会... 喜欢那样，但如果那是我们至少能暂时在一起的方式... 那么，我会这么做。"

"You know that when me and Kaworu are away we will be..." Asuka begins to ask me a question but trails off, I see the blush rising to her cheeks and understand what she was going to ask me. I feel slight embarrassment myself as I answer.  
"你知道的，当我和渚薰不在的时候，我们会……" 明日香开始问我一个问题，但话说到一半就停住了，我看到她脸颊上的红晕，明白了她想问什么。我自己也感到一丝尴尬，于是回答道。

"Yeah... I know." "嗯……我知道。"

"And you would be... fine with that as well?"  
"那你也会……接受那样的情况吗？"

I nod and start to answer, wanting to me honest with her, "I'd be... jealous and maybe feel a bit left out I guess but I know... It is what people do and... I guess we'd be able to do stuff when... we're all together I mean... if you both wanted to! I don't want to assume anything! I..."  
我点头并开始回答，想要对她诚实，“我会……嫉妒，也许还会感到有点被排除在外，但我知道……这是人们会做的事，而且……我想我们在一起的时候可以做些事情，我是说……如果你们俩都愿意的话！我不想假设任何事情！我……”

"Shinji, it's alright." She lets out a sigh, "I guess... we have little choice, do we? It's either that or nothing at all. When we can though... as soon as we can I want all three of us together. I don't care if it's Japan or Germany, I don't care if it's none of them but all three of us... living together. Got it?"  
“真嗣，没关系。”她叹了口气，“我想……我们别无选择，对吧？要么这样，要么什么都没有。只要有机会……一旦有机会，我希望我们三个人在一起。我不在乎是在日本还是德国，我不在乎这些地方，只要我们三个人……一起生活。明白了吗？”

I nod again and smile, "Of course."  
我再次点头并微笑，“当然。”

I start to lean in towards her but she takes a step back, removing her hand from my cheek and also lifting my own hand off of hers. She shakes her head, "No... Not yet. I said before, we do this properly. Don't get me wrong, I want to but if we're going to do anything more... Kaworu too... okay?"  
我开始向她倾斜，但她后退了一步，从我的脸颊上移开了手，同时也把我的手从她的手上移开。她摇了摇头，“不……还不行。我之前说过，我们要做得妥当。别误会，我也很想，但如果我们要做更多的事……还有薰……好吗？”

I nod, fully understanding and feeling some slight guilt at my actions, "Y-Yeah..."  
我点头，完全理解并为自己的行为感到一丝内疚，“嗯-嗯……”

"So... We talk to Kaworu and what, say yes? But then we all try to come up with some sort of system or rules? Arrange when we can all see each other?" She asks, "I guess it's a lot to go through at... this time of night. We could just... go tell him and... come back up here to bed... sort it out in the morning?"  
“所以……我们和薰谈谈，然后怎么说，同意吗？但接下来我们要想出某种系统或规则？安排我们什么时候能见面？”她问道，“我想这大半夜的要考虑很多。我们可以……先去告诉他，然后……回到这里睡觉……明早再解决？”

Again, I nod slowly, my mouth going dry at hearing her words and the implications. When she said... come back up to bed she meant... all three of us... all three... sharing the same... I swallow as I feel certain parts of my body start to react to the thought and I very quickly try to think about anything else to stem it. Now is definitely not the time, I look and see Asuka grinning at me, "You like the sound of that, yes?"  
我又一次缓缓点头，听到她的话和其中的含义，我的嘴巴变得干燥。当她说...回到床上时，她指的是...我们三个...我们三个...共享同一个...我咽了咽口水，感觉到身体某些部位开始对这想法产生反应，我迅速试图想些别的东西来抑制它。现在绝对不是时候，我看着，看到明日香对我咧嘴笑，“你喜欢这个主意，对吧？”

I nod a third time as she steps towards me and cups my cheek again, "So do I... So, let's go and get Kaworu and give him the good news."  
我第三次点头，她向我走来，再次用手掌托住我的脸颊，“我也是...那么，我们去把薰接来，告诉他这个好消息。”

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

"Let's do it." “就这么办。”

It takes a moment for Asuka's words to actually register themselves in my head. I had been sat in the bar of this hotel for twenty minutes now, trying desperately to find something to distract my mind. All I could do was go over the same scenarios over and over in my head, all the ones in which my offer to the two of them is rejected but none of them ending positively for me.  
须臾之间，明日香的话语才真正在我的脑海中回响。我已在这家酒店的酒吧里坐了二十分钟，拼命寻找能分散注意力的事物。我只能一遍遍地在心中重演那些我向他们两人提出的提议被拒绝的情景，却没有一个结局对我有利。

It started as soon as I left the hotel room, I thought I heard movement, my brain registered that was Shinji and Asuka making a move on one another. Their love for each other confirmed and now they could move forward without me. Throughout the twenty minutes my mind would return to that, the image of the two of them kissing, making love and then coming down here to tell me that it was a nice offer but they'd rather do things without me.  
从我离开酒店房间的那一刻起，我就觉得听到了动静，我的大脑告诉我那是真嗣和明日香在彼此靠近。他们彼此的爱得到了确认，现在可以抛下我继续前行了。这二十分钟里，我的思绪不断回到那个画面：他们接吻，做爱，然后下来告诉我，虽然提议不错，但他们宁愿没有我参与。

It was a stupid thought I know. The two of them are not like that, they would not betray me like that and neither of them could live with the guilt. Still, stupid thoughts are often the most pervasive.  
我知道这是个愚蠢的想法。他们俩不是那样的人，不会那样背叛我，他们也无法承受那种愧疚。尽管如此，愚蠢的想法往往最为顽固。

Another scenario, and perhaps more likely, the two of them argue about it. They allow their old fears to resurface and push one another away. This goes on for twenty minutes until they both realize such a suggestion could never work. We all end up going out separate ways after that, my actions having fractured a friendship and a relationship.  
另一种情况，或许更可能发生的是，他们为此争吵起来。他们让旧日的恐惧重新浮现，彼此疏远。这种情况持续了二十分钟，直到他们俩都意识到这样的提议根本行不通。之后我们各自分道扬镳，我的行为已然破坏了一段友谊和一段关系。

Asuka's questions have also got me thinking about the relationship long term as well. I had given some brief thought as to how things might work. I had thought about how we could arrange a schedule to visit each other whilst we could not move to Japan or Shinji to Germany but admittedly, I did not think too much about the toll it would take on them nor whether or not they would be happy with that arrangement. I admit, I was somewhat selfish in my thoughts but then I also believe that love is powerful and the love we share could help us overcome that difficulty.  
明日香的问题也让我开始思考这段关系的长期发展。我曾简略地考虑过事情可能如何进展。我想过在我们不能搬到日本或真嗣不能来德国的情况下，如何安排时间互相探访，但坦白说，我没有过多考虑这对他们的影响，也没有想过他们是否会对这种安排感到满意。我承认，我的想法有些自私，但我也相信爱情的力量，我们之间的爱能帮助我们克服这些困难。

I appreciate my situation does complicate matters somewhat. I only just realized that not only does my role with Fuyutsuki hold me back but the scrutiny of the UN on my person also hinders things. The issue with Fuyutsuki is easily solved, he has told me of his plans to retire soon, I did not tell the two of them this year. I suppose I wanted to see if we could agree to do this without that knowledge.  
我得承认，我的处境确实让事情变得有些复杂。我刚刚才意识到，不仅我的角色与冬月先生有关联让我受限，联合国对我的个人审查也阻碍了事情的发展。与冬月先生的问题容易解决，他已告诉我他计划不久后退休，我今年没有告诉他们这件事。我想我是想看看我们能否在没有这个知识的情况下达成一致。

As far as my piano teaching goes, I will surely miss my students but with the technology on offer it isn't as if I cannot stay in contact with them and I could easily teach piano if I moved to Japan. That is indeed, if we moved to Japan. I am making an assumption that Asuka would wish to make that move. In which case Shinji would move to Germany, a move I am not so sure he would make. He has stronger ties to this place, he has family he loves and friends. It is a complicated issue.  
至于我的钢琴教学，我肯定会想念我的学生，但有了现有的技术，我并非不能与他们保持联系，而且如果我搬到日本，我也能轻松地教授钢琴。确实，如果我们搬到日本的话。我是在假设明日香愿意做出这样的搬迁。那样的话，真嗣会搬到德国，我不太确定他是否愿意这样做。他对这个地方有更深的羁绊，他有他爱的家人和朋友。这是一个复杂的问题。

All of these things have helped to sew more seeds of doubt in my mind. I was strong... I truly was whilst putting the idea forward because I believe it is the best thing for the three of us. I know we all love on another and I believe we should all embrace that fact and let it happen. Reality is not always so kind though, and that is why when I saw Asuka and Shinji enter the room I was so very nervous.  
所有这些事情都在我心中播下了更多怀疑的种子。我曾坚强...在提出这个想法时，我确实是坚强的，因为我相信这对我们三个人来说是最好的。我知道我们都彼此相爱，我相信我们应该接受这个事实并让它发生。然而，现实并不总是那么仁慈，这就是为什么当我看到明日香和真嗣进入房间时，我会如此紧张。

Until she said those words. They took a moment to register but then I felt it in my heart, my body and my soul. Elation, pure joy and elation.  
直到她说出那些话。它们需要一点时间来注册，但随后我在内心、身体和灵魂中感受到了。喜悦，纯粹的喜悦和兴奋。

"Y-You mean..." “你-你的意思是...”

"The three of us... a relationship." Asuka answers me, "Yes, we spoke about it and we agreed it wouldn't be easy. There are a lot of things to work out but... yes. Let's go for it, we've faced the impossible before and won, compared to that this'll be... easy, right?"  
"我们三个...一段关系。" 明日香回答我，"是的，我们谈过了，也知道这不容易。有很多事情需要解决，但是...是的。我们试试吧，我们曾经面对过不可能并取得了胜利，相比之下，这会...简单些，对吧？"

I turn to Shinji, "You are... okay with this?"  
我转向真嗣，"你...对此没问题吗？"

"Yes." Shinji smiles and nods, "I... want this Kaworu,"  
"是的。" 真嗣微笑着点头，"我...想要这样，薰。"

"You two... I... I don't know what to say. I-"  
"你们俩...我...我不知道该说什么。我-"

Asuka quickly places a finger on my lips, "Say nothing else. It's been a long night and there is a lot to work out but we can work it out tomorrow. It's late and... I think we're all pretty tired, right?"  
明日香迅速将手指放在我的唇上，"别再说什么了。今晚很长，有很多事情需要解决，但我们明天可以解决。已经很晚了，而且...我想我们都相当累了，对吧？"

I nod as she withdraws her finger from my lips, "Yes... I am."  
我点头，她从我唇边收回手指，"是的...我确实累了。"

"Good." She says as she leans in and kisses me on the lips, "Then I think we should return to our rooms."  
"好。" 她一边说着，一边倾身过来吻了我的唇，"那我想我们应该回各自的房间了。"

I get to my feet and watch as she takes a step back and also kisses Shinji on the lips turning and grinning at me, "You have no objections to Shinji coming as well, do you?"  
我站起身，看着她后退一步，同样吻了真嗣的唇，然后转头对我笑着说，"你不介意真嗣也一起来吧？"

"None at all." I shake my head, as I step forward and look him in his eyes before kissing him softly on the lips too. I reach out with a hand taking hold of one of his hands, with my other hand I take hold of one of Asukas. I look between the two of them and see them take hold of one another's spare hands.  
"一点也不介意。" 我摇摇头，上前一步，直视他的眼睛，轻轻地吻了他的唇。我伸出一只手握住他的一只手，另一只手则握住明日香的一只手。我看着他们俩，看到他们也互相握住了对方空着的手。

"Thank you... truly... I love you both."  
"谢谢你...真的...我爱你们两个。"

### Chapter 28: Braver
**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I finish tying the lace on the boot, lift it and wriggle my foot around a little bit in an attempt to get used to how tight the boot is and the weight of it. I look up from the bench I'm on, and up over the barrier at the people skating, the sudden drop in my stomach tells me what a stupid idea this truly was. In fact, not only was agreeing to this a stupid idea but I've managed to once again open my big mouth and set myself up for humiliation!  
我系好靴子的鞋带，抬起脚，稍微扭动了一下，试图适应靴子的紧绷感和重量。我从坐着的板凳上抬起头，越过障碍物看向正在滑冰的人们，突然间胃部一沉，告诉我这真是个愚蠢的主意。事实上，不仅同意这样做是个愚蠢的想法，我还又一次张开了我的大嘴巴，让自己陷入了尴尬的境地！

_'Oh yes Shinji, of course I've done this before! It's so easy!'  
'哦，是的，真嗣，当然我以前做过这个！太简单了！'_

_'Why yes Kaworu! I'll show you both how it's done, you'll both get to see how amazing I am!'  
'当然可以，卡沃鲁！我会向你们两个展示真正的技术，你们将见识到我有多么了不起！'_

Why do I do this? Why did I have to open my mouth without thinking first? Why am I like this? Now, I actually have to go out on that ice rink and pretend I know what the hell I'm doing! I'm completely at a loss as to how I'm going to do that. It's not like I can bluff suddenly being good at ice skating. I can't just go on there and start doing spins and jumps like some of these people! If anything, just attempting that is a sure-fire way to break several bones in my body and end up looking like a tit in front of those two!  
我为什么要这么做？为什么我总是不假思索地开口？我为什么会这样？现在，我真的得踏上那个冰场，假装我知道自己在干什么！我完全不知道该如何是好。总不能突然装作擅长滑冰吧。我可不能就这么上去开始旋转跳跃，像某些人那样！如果真那么做，无疑是自找苦吃，摔断几根骨头，在两人面前出尽洋相！

Gott! I have such a big mouth! Why? Why? Why? Why? It's not like I need to impress the two of them! We're all dating! We've all slept together for god sakes! They love me as I am! I don't need to do anything to impress them, least of all kill myself wearing this monstrous footwear with blades that can slide through a limb on them whilst moving on a surface people aren't made to be walking on!  
天哪！我这张大嘴巴！为什么？为什么？为什么？为什么？我并不需要在他们面前留下深刻印象啊！我们都在交往！我们都一起睡过觉了！他们爱我本来的样子！我不需要做任何事情来打动他们，更不用说穿着这双带刀片的可怕鞋子，在人类本不该行走的表面上自寻死路！

Well, I have both boots on now and I can't back out. I place both my feet on the ground and push myself up off of the bench. I take a step forward, walking in these... it's not so bad, I'm a little bit wobbly but it's okay. I see Kaworu ahead of me, he's standing by the entrance to the rink, looking very unsure of himself as he struggles to keep his balance. I put on my best, and most confident, smile and walk towards him. A smile that I feel fading slightly as the fear of falling over sets in.  
好了，现在两只靴子都穿上了，我没法退缩。我把双脚放在地上，从长椅上撑起身来。向前迈出一步，穿着这些...其实也没那么糟，虽然有点摇晃，但还好。我看到卡罗在前方，他站在溜冰场入口处，看起来对自己保持平衡的能力很不确定。我露出最棒、最自信的微笑，向他走去。但随着跌倒的恐惧袭来，我感觉这微笑稍稍黯淡了些。

Honestly, I could hate Kaworu for suggesting this as a thing to do on our last day. Damn guy saw other couples doing it the other day and thought it'd be 'oh, so romantic', what's romantic about breaking your ankle? What's romantic about bleeding out on a patch of ice? Am I being over the top? Maybe, but after the life I've had what's wrong with sitting in a nice café on a hilltop having a cup of hot chocolate?  
老实说，我真可以因为卡罗提议在最后一天做这件事而恨他。该死的家伙前几天看到其他情侣这么做，觉得会'哦，太浪漫了'，摔断脚踝有什么浪漫的？在冰面上流血又有什么浪漫的？我是不是太过分了？也许吧，但经历了我那样的生活，坐在山顶咖啡馆里喝杯热巧克力有什么不好？

If my younger self could only hear me now!  
如果我年轻时的自己能听到我现在的话！

My mind turns to Shinji, he's not escaping my ire either. Shinji... He went along with it immediately. He jumped at the chance! He was so eager to do it but I don't see him now, do I? Probably chickened out! Probably can't even get his skates on. This is the thing, I'm not just worried about my safety! It's theirs as well! How are Shinji and Kaworu going to manage something like this?  
我的思绪转向了真嗣，他也没能逃脱我的怒火。真嗣...他立刻就同意了。他迫不及待地抓住了机会！他是那么急切地想要去做，但现在我看不到他，不是吗？大概临阵退缩了吧！可能连溜冰鞋都穿不上。问题是，我不仅仅担心自己的安全！还有他们的！真嗣和薰怎么能应付这样的事情呢？

Still, if the two of them weren't so handsome then I'd really hate the pair of them. As it is, I'll just have to settle for mild annoyance. Damnit, what has happened to me? Allowing myself to be swayed by two... elegant and sexily dressed men!  
不过，如果他们俩不是那么英俊的话，我真会恨透他们俩。既然如此，我只能忍受些许的烦恼。该死，我这是怎么了？竟然被两个...优雅且穿着性感的人所左右！

I look across at Kaworu once again, he must have known what he was doing when he put on those clothes. The black jacket, the loose grey scarf tucked in at the top, the grey gloves and the dark and distractingly tight trousers... it's like he picked everything to make his silvery hair and handsome face stand out so much more.  
我又一次看向薰，他穿上那身衣服时一定知道自己要做什么。那件黑色夹克，松散的灰色围巾塞在顶部，灰色手套和那条深色且引人注目的紧身裤...他似乎挑选了每一件衣物，让他的银色头发和英俊面庞更加突出。

Shinji... he's not so bad either. I presume Rei had a hand in that, maybe I'm being unfair but he doesn't come across as the most fashion-conscious person in the world. I still can't see where he is, but he's dressed well. A blue scarf, a lengthy cream jacket, brown-ish gloves. It all looks brand new as well.  
真嗣...他其实也不坏。我猜绫波在这一点上起了作用，也许我有些不公平，但他看起来并不像是那种特别注重时尚的人。我还是看不到他在哪儿，不过他穿得挺好。一条蓝色围巾，一件长长的奶油色夹克，还有棕色的手套。一切都看起来崭新无比。

I've opted for a dark red jacket that comes down to just past my hips, just as well for when I fall and bust my head open. I've got a pair of dark blue jeans on, no scarf and thin red gloves on. If I had known we'd be doing this today then I might have gone for something with a bit more padding. I was dressing for shopping and café visits with my boyfriend's not... an afternoon at the hospital!  
我选择了一件深红色的夹克，长度刚好过臀，这样摔倒时脑袋也不会太惨。我穿着一条深蓝色牛仔裤，没有围巾，戴了一副薄薄的红手套。如果早知道今天会来这里，我可能会选择一些更有缓冲的衣服。我原本是准备和男朋友逛街和咖啡馆约会的，而不是在医院度过一个下午！

"So, where is he?" I call out to Kaworu as I approach, "No, let me guess! He's chickened out hasn't he? He couldn't even get his skates on?"  
“那么，他在哪儿？”我走近时向渚薰喊道，“不，让我猜猜！他是不是临阵退缩了？连冰鞋都没穿上？”

Kaword smiles back at me but also shakes his head, instead he turns and points towards the rink, "Actually... It would seem that much unlike the other night; this is not Shinji's first time."  
渚薰对我回以微笑，但也摇了摇头，转而指向溜冰场，“实际上……与前几晚大不相同；这似乎不是真嗣的初次尝试。”

"Pervert." I jab Kaworu in the ribs with my elbow before looking out at the ice to see what he is pointing at. I feel the grin fade from my face as I see Shinji, it's far from the sight I expected to see as well. Instead of being clumsy and falling over, much like I imagine myself and Kaworu will be, Shinji is skating... and he's skating well. He's graceful and fast, I look on as he skillfully passes a couple of people without a care, "Oh..."  
“变态。”我用肘部轻戳了下渚薰的肋骨，然后望向冰面，看看他在指什么。当我看到真嗣时，脸上的笑容逐渐消失，这完全出乎我的意料。真嗣并没有笨拙地摔倒，与我预想中自己和渚薰可能会有的狼狈模样截然不同，他在滑冰……而且滑得很好。他动作优雅，速度飞快，我看着他熟练地绕过几个人，毫不在意，“哦……”

"indeed." Kaworu nods, "So I have to ask... you... haven't really done this... have you?"  
“确实。”渚薰点头道，“所以我得问……你……真的没尝试过这个……对吧？”

I shrug my shoulders and turn back to face him, an embarassed grin starts to form, "Define... having done this..."  
我耸了耸肩，转过身面对他，尴尬的笑容开始浮现，“定义一下...做过这件事...”

"So that is a no then." He merely laughs and turns top look at the rink again, "I'm glad, I thought that I would be the only one."  
“那这就是个不字了。”他只是笑了笑，转身再次看向溜冰场，“我很高兴，我以为只有我一个人。”

"Yeah well... Just keep it quiet will you!" I let out a sigh as I rest my hands on the barrier, "I already feel stupid enough about boasting to you both earlier."  
“是啊，好吧... 就别声张了，好吗！”我叹了口气，双手撑在栏杆上，“我之前向你们俩吹嘘，已经觉得自己够傻的了。”

"But why?" He smiles at me, "You know neither of us would have judged you."  
"但为什么呢？" 他对我微笑，"你知道我们俩都不会评判你的。"

"I know that but I'm me, aren't I?" I give him the honest answer, "It's not about the two of you judging me, it's about my pride... it's about me... being a goddamn idiot! Look, let's just get this over and done with. How difficult can it really be? I mean there are children here? Besides, if Shinji managed to learn it then I'm sure we ca-"  
"我知道这一点，但我就是我，不是吗？" 我给了他一个诚实的回答，"这不是关于你们俩评判我，而是关于我的自尊……关于我……真是个该死的傻瓜！听着，我们还是赶紧把这事做完吧。能有多难呢？我是说这里有孩子们在看呢？而且，如果真嗣都能学会，那我相信我们也能——"

I'm not sure what I regret more, the words I'm speaking or the fact that I've just walked onto the ice without focusing on what's in front of me. Maybe both at the same time, maybe both contribute to this. The first step I take is actually fine, I get onto the ice and then I take a second step. That too is fine, but it's the third step, the one where I'm in the middle of mentioning Shinji and gesturing wildly that I start to falter.  
我不确定我更后悔的是说出口的话，还是我竟然没集中注意力就踏上了冰面。或许两者都有，或许两者都导致了这一切。我迈出的第一步其实还好，我上了冰面然后迈出第二步。那也还好，但就是第三步，我正提到真嗣并疯狂比划的时候，我开始摇晃了。

My foot slips and I stumble forward, I try to regain my balance but the front of my skate feels like it gets stuck which causes my other foot to go. Time seems to slow down, like some silly old cartoon and all I can do is go into panic mode as I await the inevitable. Sure enough, it happens and a moment later I feel and hear the thud as I painfully land on the ice, backside first.  
我的脚一滑，向前踉跄了几步，试图恢复平衡，但前方的冰刀似乎卡住了，导致另一只脚也跟着滑出去。时间仿佛慢了下来，就像那些愚蠢的老卡通片一样，我只能陷入恐慌模式，等待着不可避免的结局。果然，事情发生了，片刻后我感到并听到了自己痛苦地摔在冰面上，屁股着地的声音。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

I curse under my breath as I hear the voice calling my name. It's not Kaworu but Shinji, I look up to see him skating towards me and stopping himself close by, "Are you okay?"  
我低声咒骂着，听到有人叫我的名字。不是薰，而是真嗣，我抬头看到他滑向我，停在我旁边，“你还好吗？”

"Do I look okay?" I snap back at him, "Stupid ice..."  
"我看起来还好吗？" 我回呛他，"愚蠢的冰..."

I try to ignore the hurt look on his face as I focus on getting back to my feet. Fortunately, that doesn't seem to be too much of an issue thanks to my proximity to the barrier. As I get up, I try to ignore the looks of the other skaters and spectators. I lean myself against the barrier for stability and turn myself to face Shinji, he moves towards me holding out his hands.  
我试图忽视他脸上的受伤表情，专注于重新站起来。幸运的是，由于我离护栏很近，这似乎并不太困难。当我起身时，我尽量不去理会其他滑冰者和观众的眼神。我靠在护栏上以保持稳定，然后转身面对真嗣，他向我走来，伸出双手。

"I think I'm fine here for the moment." I quickly say, he puts his hands down, and again I try to ignore the look of hurt on his face. I'm snapping at him for something that isn't his fault! He thinks I've done this before so he probably didn't expect such a harsh rejection. God damnit! Why did I have to be such an idiot? I quickly try to get him to focus on something else, "Go and see to Angel boy! He probably needs your help more."  
"我觉得我现在还好。" 我迅速说道，他放下手，我又一次试图忽视他脸上的受伤表情。我因为不是他的错而对他发火！他以为我以前做过这种事，所以可能没想到会遭到如此严厉的拒绝。该死！我为什么要这么蠢？我迅速试图让他转移注意力，"去看看那个天使男孩！他可能更需要你的帮助。"

I turn around to see Kaworu stood at the edge of the rink looking at the two of us with a fearful look on his face. I try to take some solace from the fact that his smug grin has faded but at least he, unlike me has been honest about this. I look on as Shinji makes his way to Kaworu and holds out a hand, "Here, take my hand Kaworu. Don't worry, it'll be alright."  
我转过身，看到渚薰站在溜冰场的边缘，脸上带着恐惧的表情看着我们俩。我试图从他那自鸣得意的笑容消失这一事实中找到些许安慰，但至少他，不像我，对这一切是诚实的。我看着真嗣走向渚薰，伸出手，“来，握住我的手，渚薰。别担心，一切都会好起来的。”

It's hard to not feel jealous at the display in front of me. I look on and see Kaworu take Shinji's hand, I see the two of them exchange a smile and watch as Kaworu steps onto the ice hand in hand with Shinji. That could have been me, we could all have been hand in hand if I hadn't opened my big mouth.  
眼前的这一幕让人很难不感到嫉妒。我看着渚薰握住真嗣的手，看到他们相视而笑，看着渚薰在真嗣的搀扶下踏上冰面。那本可以是我在其中，我们本可以手牵手在一起，如果我没有多嘴的话。

"Thank you, Shinji." Kaworu smiles as he steadies himself, "So... what now?"  
“谢谢你，真嗣。”渚薰微笑着稳住自己，“那么……现在怎么办？”

"What do you mean, what now?" I exclaim, "We skate around the rink, you know... the same thing everyone else is doing!"  
"你这是什么意思，现在怎么办？" 我惊呼，"我们在溜冰场上滑行，你知道的...就像其他人一样！"

"I am aware of that." he replies, "I just meant... how does one actually skate?"  
"我知道那一点。" 他回答，"我只是想知道...一个人究竟怎么滑冰？"

"I-It's actually not too difficult." Shinji smiles at him and turns to face me, "We can show him, right Asuka?"  
"其实并不太难。" 真嗣对他微笑，然后转向我，"我们可以教他，对吧，明日香？"

Shinji lets go of Kaworu's hand and pushes himself backwards a little bit so he is in the center of the two of us. He looks at me, awaiting my answer and I look to Kaworu to see only a sheepish smile. I let out a sigh, it's probably best I come clean.  
真嗣松开了卡罗的手，向后挪了一点，这样他就位于我们俩中间了。他看着我，等待我的回答，而我看向卡罗，只见到一个尴尬的微笑。我叹了口气，也许最好还是坦白。

"Actually Shinji..." I pause, "I um... haven't actually done this before either. I kinda... lied."  
“实际上，真嗣……”我顿了顿，“我嗯……其实也没做过这个。我有点……撒谎了。”

I see the look of confusion on his face spread as he looks at Kaworu who nods, smug smile on his face, and then back to me, "I... don't understand, what do you mean..."  
我看到他脸上的困惑在蔓延，他看着卡罗，卡罗点了点头，脸上带着得意的微笑，然后又看向我，“我……不明白，你是什么意思……”

"Do not make me repeat my words Ikari! What is there to be confused about! I lied!"  
"不要让我重复我的话，碇！有什么好困惑的！我撒谎了！"

"B-But why?" He asks. "但为什么？" 他问道。

"Just teach us both how to skate!" I quickly cut him off, perhaps sounding a bit angrier than I intended to but my pride has taken enough of a hit today already. I just want to get on with this and at least do something.  
"就教我们两个怎么滑冰吧！" 我迅速打断他，也许听起来比我想象的更生气，但我的自尊今天已经受够了打击。我只是想继续前进，至少做点什么。

"O-Okay..." he nods, "I mean... I've never really taught someone and I wasn't taught, I just kinda... picked it up. I don't really know what to say."  
"好-好吧..." 他点头，"我的意思是... 我从未真正教过别人，也没有人教过我，我只是... 自然而然地学会了。我真的不知道该说什么。"

"It is okay Shinji." Kaworu moves to stem his fears, "it is only the basics we require, if you just go ahead then we can... watch and follow your lead, can't we Asuka?"  
"没关系的，真嗣。" 渚薰上前安抚他的紧张，"我们只需要基础知识，如果你先开始，我们就可以... 观察并跟随你的引导，对吧，明日香？"

"Yeah whatever." I slowly and clumsily make my way in front of Kaworu, hugging the wall as I do so. Pride be damned now. What use is pride to me when I have a broken neck? I position myself with one hand hovering above the wall and the other down by my side. As I position myself I see a few people glide past us, a couple with a child in front of them, pushing a penguin shaped support.  
"是啊，随便吧。" 我缓慢而笨拙地走到渚薰前面，紧紧抱着墙壁。骄傲什么的现在都无所谓了。当我的脖子都断了，骄傲还有什么用？我调整姿势，一只手悬在墙上方，另一只手垂在身侧。当我调整姿势时，我看到几个人从我们身边滑过，一对夫妇带着一个孩子，前面推着一个企鹅形状的支撑物。"

"It is an adorable scene isn't it?" I hear Kaworu behind me.  
"这真是个可爱的场景，不是吗？" 我听到身后的渚薰说道。

I nod, unable to deny that it is quite adorable. I look up at Shinji who is looking at the two of us, quite nervously I might add. Why is it he looks more nervous than we do? At least he can skate.  
我点头，无法否认这确实相当可爱。我抬头看向真嗣，他正看着我们俩，显得相当紧张。我得说，为什么他看起来比我们还紧张？至少他会滑冰。

"O-Okay... I will go slowly then." Shinji says as he turns and begins to move away. I keep an eye on his feet, watching how he moves and wondering how to replicate that myself. I keep my hand just above the wall as I push myself away and take that first proper step. My feet feel... weird as I slowly move forward, every now and then putting my hand on the wall to steady myself. I try to mimic Shinji's steps but have some difficulty, every so often I feel like I'm getting it only to slow down immediately or feel my boot getting caught.  
"好...好的...那我会慢慢来。" 真嗣说着转身开始移动。我留意着他的脚步，观察他的动作，思考自己如何模仿。我把手轻轻搭在墙上，推动自己离开并迈出正式的第一步。我的脚感觉...很奇怪，我缓慢地向前移动，时不时用手扶墙稳住自己。我试图模仿真嗣的步伐，但有些困难，偶尔感觉自己掌握了要领，却又立刻慢下来或感到靴子被绊住。

Each step I take does build a little bit of confidence within me though, it isn't quite enough to fully let go of the wall and have my hand down by my side but it is enough to not use the wall every few steps. I continue to walk Shinji as he moves forward, his movements are fluid, he seems to be gliding along the ice with minimal effort, dodging around slower moving people without slowing himself down. He's confident, he's barely even thinking about what he is doing and he is... gorgeous.  
每迈出一步，我内心都会积攒些许自信，虽然还不足以完全放开墙壁，让手自然垂在身旁，但已足够让我不再每隔几步就依赖墙壁。我继续跟着真嗣前行，他的动作流畅，仿佛毫不费力地在冰面上滑行，轻松绕过移动缓慢的人群，丝毫不减自己的速度。他自信满满，几乎不假思索地做着这一切，而且他……真是迷人。

I'm three quarters around now and realize that for the past quarter my thoughts have been focused more on Shinji and how he looked than my skating. Not only that but I've actually been moving faster and making fewer mistakes. That, I suppose is the key to it, it's like the Eva again, the more I think about what I'm doing the more likely it'll be I make a mistake. Kaworu teaches a similar thing with the piano, the more thought you put into it the more likely you'll make mistakes. You need to be at one with what you're doing.  
我现在已经绕了四分之三圈，意识到过去四分之一的时间里，我的思绪更多地集中在真嗣和他优雅的姿态上，而非我的滑冰。不仅如此，我实际上滑得更快，犯的错误也更少了。我想，这就是关键所在，就像驾驶 EVA 一样，越是思考自己在做什么，就越容易出错。薰在钢琴上也教过类似的东西，投入越多思考，越容易犯错。你需要与所做的事情融为一体。

It's something that is easier said than done, how can I be at one with the thing when it's all I can think about? Still, this... isn't so bad. Give me a few more goes and I'll be just as good as Shinji.  
说起来容易做起来难，我满脑子都是这件事，怎么可能与它合一呢？不过，这...也不算太糟。再练几次，我就能和真嗣一样好了。

We finally get back to the entrance to the rink, I can feel my legs burning from the exertion but I managed to get around without falling over and making a tit of myself. I position myself close to Shinji and we both watch as a slightly frightened looking Kaworu makes his way towards us. His hand is still hovering just above the wall but he is moving in a good rhythm now as well. I suppress the urge to say something boastful, lest I end up falling on my ass.  
我们终于回到了溜冰场的入口，我能感觉到双腿因用力而燃烧，但我成功地绕了一圈，没有摔倒出丑。我靠近真嗣，我们一起看着略显惊慌的薰向我们走来。他的手仍然悬在墙上方，但现在他的节奏也很好。我抑制住想要炫耀的冲动，以免最后摔个屁股蹲。

"That was... quite fun." Kaworu smiles as he approaches, "But it was also frightening, I do apologize for being so slow."  
“那真是...相当有趣。”薰微笑着走近，“但也挺吓人的，我很抱歉自己这么慢。”

"Don't be an idiot!" I reach forward and grab his hand, "It's not like you've ever done this before, besides you struggle with staying upright at the best of times. It's nothing short of a miracle you managed to make it around the rink."  
"别犯傻了！" 我伸手抓住他的手，"你以前又没做过这种事，而且你平时连站稳都费劲。你能滑完一圈简直是奇迹。"

"I do believe that is something of an exaggeration." He feigns a hurt look on his face as he protests, "I am not quite as clumsy as you make me out to be!"  
"我觉得这有点夸张了。" 他假装受伤的表情抗议道，"我可没你说的那么笨手笨脚！"

"Oh really?" I raise an eyebrow, "Okay then, Shinji... Can you remind me of what happened to our resident alien last night as we were all going to bed... and can you remind me of what happened this morning as we were getting ready?"  
"哦，真的吗？" 我挑了挑眉，"那好吧，真嗣... 你能提醒我一下昨晚我们睡觉前那位外星人发生了什么事吗... 还有今早我们准备时又发生了什么？"

Before Shinji can say anything Kaworu gives a sheepish shrug, "Okay... I concede that perhaps I do have my moments."  
在真嗣能说些什么之前，薰有些尴尬地耸了耸肩，“好吧……我承认或许我确实有我的时刻。”

"Moments?" I let out a laugh, "Also, I'm sure whoever is in the room below us thought you had dropped dead."  
“时刻？”我笑出声来，“而且，我敢肯定楼下房间里的人以为你摔死了。”

"Well I am fairly sure they would have no issues believing you were alive, considering the sounds you were ma-"  
“嗯，我相当确定他们不会怀疑你还活着，考虑到你发出的那些声——”

"Um... Guys, we only have an hour..." Shinji chimes in quickly before Kaworu can finish that sentence and embarrass the three of us.  
“呃... 大家，我们只剩一个小时了...” 真嗣赶紧插话，以免渚说完那句话让我们三个都尴尬。

"Right!" I state, also making sure Kaworu can't finish that sentence. I often forget that he can sometimes have very little filter when it comes to discussing our sex life, "So let's go around again!"  
“对！” 我附和道，同样确保渚不能把那句话说完。我常常忘记他在谈论我们的性生活时有时会毫无顾忌，“所以我们再绕一圈吧！”

Shinji nods and sets off. I follow closely behind and Kaworu behind me. It takes me a few steps to find my rhythm but I start off a lot better than the previous go. With each step I feel that confidence build up within me and the fear of falling fades away. As long as I keep this up, this simple rhythm and focus then I should be alright.  
真嗣点头出发了。我紧随其后，渚跟在我后面。我花了几个步伐找到节奏，但这次起步比上次好多了。每走一步，我就感到自信在体内积累，跌倒的恐惧逐渐消退。只要我保持这种简单的节奏和专注，应该就没问题。

I feel my eyes on Shinji, every few metres he turns to check on me and Kaworu. I have to ignore the little voice in my head daring me to push and go faster to keep up with him. That little competitive voice that wants me to turn this into a race. Not now, not today, I can live without that.  
我感觉到自己的目光落在真嗣身上，每隔几米他就会回头查看我和薰的情况。我必须忽略脑海中那个怂恿我加快速度跟上他的小声音。那个想要把这一切变成比赛的竞争心。不是现在，不是今天，我可以没有它。

Before I know it, the three of us are back at the entrance once again. Shinji stops with me stopping a moment later as we turn, we can see Kaworu isn't as far behind as he was the first go around. He still looks worried and has his hand hovering above the wall but it looks like he too has gotten a bit more confident.  
不知不觉间，我们三人再次回到了入口处。真嗣停下脚步，我也随即停下，转身时看到薰并没有像第一次那样落后太远。他看起来仍然有些担忧，手悬在墙上方，但似乎他也变得更加自信了。

"This is... not as bad as I thought it would be." he says, his voice ragged as he tries to catch his breath, "Although I must admit, it is slightly more tiring than I expected."  
“这……没有我想象中那么糟糕。”他喘着气说，试图平复呼吸，“不过我得承认，比预期的要累一些。”

I laugh as the three of us look between one another, each one of us smiling and enjoying one another's company. I try to resist the sad feeling, knowing that this will be the last time the three of us can be together like this for a good few weeks. I wish we could stay. I really do but the reality is that me and Kaworu have to return to Germany, for work and because the UN only allowed us to be here for a certain amount of time.  
我们三人相视而笑，享受着彼此的陪伴。我努力压抑着那份悲伤，知道这将是我们几周内最后一次像这样聚在一起。我真希望我们能留下来。真的，但现实是我们和渚薰必须返回德国，因为工作，也因为联合国只允许我们在这里停留一定的时间。

"Asuka, are you okay?" I hear Kaworu ask me.  
“明日香，你还好吗？”我听到渚薰问我。

I nod my head, "I'm fine, say... shall we... go around together?"  
我点点头，“我没事，那个……我们要不要……一起逛逛？”

I look on as the same couple from early goes back, still holding hands and moving in a slow rhythm. Shinji looks from them to me, "Are you... sure?"  
"我看着那对早些时候见过的情侣再次走过，依旧手牵手，缓缓地移动着。真嗣从他们身上移开目光，转向我，“你……确定吗？””

I nod, "Why not? This is what Angel boy wanted, wasn't it? Seems to be a waste If we don't."  
"我点点头，“为什么不呢？这不是天使男孩想要的吗？如果我们不这么做，似乎就浪费了。””

Kaworu looks at me, "True but... what if I... fall? I would not wish to hurt either of you."  
"薰看着我，“确实，但是……如果我……摔倒了怎么办？我不想伤害你们中的任何一个。””

"Then don't fall." I shrug, "I wasn't planning on doing that and I don't think Shinji was either. Now come on, hold my hand!"  
"那就不摔呗。" 我耸耸肩，"我本来就没打算摔倒，我想真嗣也没这个打算。好了，快点，握住我的手！"

I position myself in the middle of them. With my right hand I take hold of Kaworu's left. With my left hand I take hold of Shinji's right. I take a moment to think about what Kaworu said, if he falls down then we'll all go down together. Being honest, I can think of worse things than those two falling on top of me, although that is in slightly different circumstances.  
我站在他们中间。用右手握住渚薰的左手，用左手握住真嗣的右手。我稍作思考，想起渚薰的话，如果他摔倒了，我们都会一起倒下。老实说，我能想到比这两个人压在我身上更糟糕的事情，尽管那是在稍微不同的情境下。

I'm a bit worried about falling, but I suppose I just need to put my trust in them and they need to trust me too. That's it really, we take a step forward and trust each other. It'll be a bit frightening at first and we might stumble in places but we... we can manage it.  
我对摔倒有点担心，但我想我只需要信任他们，他们也需要信任我。就是这样，我们向前迈一步，彼此信任。一开始可能会有些害怕，我们可能会在某些地方绊倒，但我们...我们能应付得来。

We take that first step, as I expected it's awkward. I feel Kaworu's hand tighten but we make it. We take another step and then another. With each step we move forward and the trust is rewarded, as it should be.  
我们迈出了第一步，正如我所预料的那样，有些笨拙。我感觉到渚薰的手握得更紧了，但我们还是做到了。我们又迈出一步，接着又一步。每一步都让我们向前进，信任得到了回报，本该如此。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

_At least this time I can say goodbye to her properly...  
至少这次我能好好地向她告别了……_

_At least this time I can say goodbye to him properly...  
至少这次我能好好地向他告别了……_

_At least this time I know I'll see the two of them again...  
至少这次我知道我会再见到他们两个..._

_This isn't me saying goodbye forever... this isn't the end of anything... this is the beginning...  
这不是我在永远告别...这不是任何事情的结束...这是开始..._

No matter how many times I repeat those things over and over to myself, it does nothing stop the sadness I'm feeling as I follow the two of them into the airport entrance. I can feel the sting of tears in my eyes and the tightness in my chest. I don't want them to leave, I don't want them to go back to Germany or at least I wish I was going with them.  
无论我对自己重复这些话多少次，都无法阻止我跟随他们进入机场入口时感受到的悲伤。我能感觉到眼中的泪水刺痛和胸口的紧绷。我不想让他们离开，我不想让他们回德国，至少我希望我能和他们一起去。

I love them both so much and I don't know what I'll do without them near to me. I don't know what I'll do when I wake up in the morning and I don't see their sleeping forms. I don't know what I'll do when I wake up and I can't reach out to hold either of them. I want to be with them all the time, I want them to be around all the time. I love them so much.  
我深爱着他们两人，无法想象没有他们在身边我会怎么办。我不知道早晨醒来时看不到他们熟睡的身影我会如何是好。我不知道醒来后无法伸手拥抱他们中的任何一个我会怎么办。我希望能时刻与他们在一起，希望他们能永远在我身边。我深爱着他们。

We come to a stop near one of the ticket machines and I look at them both, first Kaworu... my boyfriend and then Asuka... my girlfriend. It's been just over a week since we confessed our feelings and said we'd give it a go. A week of... being together with them... holding hands, cuddling... going shopping, me cooking for them, going out for dinner the ice skating and making love to the two of them. We all knew this day would come and it hurts so much.  
我们在一台售票机旁停下，我看着他们俩，先是我的男朋友薰，然后是我的女朋友明日香。自从我们坦露心迹并决定尝试在一起已经过去了一个多星期。这一周里，我们一起度过了许多时光——牵手、拥抱、购物、我为他们做饭、外出用餐、滑冰以及与他们两人共度爱河。我们都知道这一天终将到来，这让我心痛不已。

"Shinji..." It is Asuka who speaks first. I turn to see her looking at me, her bottom lip trembling and I see the faint form of a tear in the corner of her eye. I take her hand in mine as she looks away to compose herself, "...You know this is... not... because we want to go, right?"  
“真嗣……” 明日香首先开口了。我转头看到她望着我，下唇微微颤抖，眼角隐约闪烁着泪光。我握住她的手，她别过头去整理情绪，“……你知道，这不是……因为我们想离开，对吧？”

"I know." I nod my head, "I know... You guys have to go back, the stuff with the UN and I can't go with you because of that too."  
"我知道。" 我点点头，"我知道... 你们得回去，联合国的事，我也不能跟你们走，也是因为这个。"

I try to mask the bitterness in my voice as I say that. Being angry at this point would be fruitless, trying to rebel against it would only hurt us all. We all agreed to the conditions the UN put forward and all we can do is deal with it.  
我尽量掩饰声音中的苦涩。此时生气毫无意义，试图反抗只会伤害我们所有人。我们都同意了联合国提出的条件，现在只能面对现实。

"It's also going to be Christmas soon Shinji... you should be here with Misato and Rei... with your family and not with us." Asuka reminds me.  
"圣诞节也快到了，真嗣... 你应该和美里、丽... 和你的家人在一起，而不是跟我们。" 明日香提醒我。

"I... I know that..." I answer, "I just wish..."  
"我...我知道..." 我回答，"我只是希望..."

I shake my head as I trail off, I feel Kaworu take my other hand and I turn to face him. He's sad, he's been sad and silent all morning.  
我摇摇头，话音渐渐消失，感觉到渚薰握住了我的另一只手，我转身面对他。他很悲伤，整个早上他都一直悲伤而沉默。

"it is... difficult to say goodbye to you once again Shinji..." He finally says, his voice low and in danger of cracking, "I suppose... at least this time it is under better circumstances. I am... very much alive, after all."  
"再次与你告别...确实很难，真嗣..." 他终于开口，声音低沉，几乎要哽咽，"我想...至少这次是在更好的情况下。毕竟...我现在还活着。"

I let out a small laugh as I let go of their hands, "Yeah... That is something."  
我轻声笑了出来，松开他们的手，“是啊...确实如此。”

I look and see Asuka grinning, "And hey... at least I don't think I hate you all, I guess we've all made some progress."  
我望去，看到明日香咧嘴笑着，“而且嘿...至少我觉得我不讨厌你们了，我想我们都取得了一些进步。”

I'm still laughing as I answer, "Yeah, I suppose we have."  
我仍在笑着回答，“是啊，我想我们确实如此。”

"Are you going to be okay Shinji?" Kaworu asks me, the laughter fading as he places a hand on my shoulder.  
"真嗣，你会没事的吧？" 渚问我，笑声渐消，他将手放在我的肩上。

"Yeah... I will be. I'm just... not used to goodbyes like this. Usually people just leave me." I half smile and shrug, "You two... won't forget about me, will you?"  
"嗯... 我会没事的。我只是... 不太习惯这样的告别。通常人们只是离开我。" 我苦笑了一下，耸耸肩，"你们俩... 不会忘记我吧？"

"Idiot!" Asuka punches me playfully in the shoulder, "We love you Shinji. The three of us are... we're all together. This isn't just me and Kaworu with you are the side dish, this is me... and you and Kaworu. We're equal and we are going to miss you so goddamn much."  
"笨蛋！" 明日香开玩笑地捶了我的肩膀一下，"我们爱你，真嗣。我们三个... 我们是一体的。这不只是我和渚带着你这个配菜，而是我... 和你，还有渚。我们是平等的，我们会非常非常想念你的。"

Asuka moves forward wrapping her arms around me tightly and burying her head into my shoulder, I let her rest for a moment before bringing up my hand and gently stroking it through her hair. I feel her shoulders shake slightly and hear her whisper, "Idiot. I love you."  
明日香走上前来，紧紧地抱住我，将头埋在我的肩膀上，我让她稍作休息，然后抬起手，温柔地抚摸着她的头发。我感觉到她的肩膀微微颤抖，听到她低声说：“笨蛋。我爱你。”

"I... understand what you are feeling Shinji, under the same circumstances I think I would... feel the same but Asuka is right. You are an equal part of this relationship and we could... never forget about you. You are beyond precious to us, we... love you."  
“我……理解你的感受，真嗣，在同样的情况下，我想我也会……有同样的感受，但明日香说得对。你是这段关系中平等的一部分，我们……永远不会忘记你。你对我们来说无比珍贵，我们……爱你。”

I nod again, "I know, I love you both too."  
我再次点头，“我知道，我也爱你们俩。”

Asuka pulls herself away from me and rubs her eyes, I reach forward and wipe away one of the still remaining tears from her cheek.  
明日香从我身边抽身，揉了揉眼睛，我伸手拭去她脸颊上残留的一滴泪珠。

"We won't abandon you Shinji, as soon as we get back to Germany, we'll call you. We'll work out when you can come visit us or when we can visit you, I don't care which one. Just... don't think we're going to leave or anything."  
"我们不会抛弃你的，真嗣，一回到德国，我们就给你打电话。我们会商量好你什么时候能来看我们，或者我们什么时候能去看你，我不在乎是哪一种。只是...别以为我们会离开你什么的。"

"I... I know, I won't. Thank you."  
"我...我知道，我不会的。谢谢你们。"

Asuka moves forward again and we take a moment to look into one another's eyes before she leans in further, and our lips meet. We stand there sharing a kiss, before she breaks it and looks at me, "I love you Shinji."  
明日香再次向前移动，我们短暂地凝视着彼此的眼睛，然后她更靠近了些，我们的唇相遇了。我们站在那里分享着亲吻，直到她分开，看着我，“我爱你，真嗣。”

"I love you too..." I manage to choke out, the emotion rising once again.  
“我也爱你……”我勉强哽咽着说出，情感再次涌上心头。

I turn myself towards Kaworu who takes both my hands into his, "I love you Shinji."  
我转向卡洛，他将我的双手握在他的手中，“我爱你，真嗣。”

"I love you too Kaworu." We look into each other's eyes, much like Asuka and I did moments ago but the look lingers as we both become unsure. We're both not quite used to being affectionate in public yet, we both worry about the attitude of others might be towards it but then... this might be the last time I see him for a while. If I don't do this now then... I don't want to wait months for it. I step forward, putting my hand on the back of his head and pulling him towards me. Our lips part slightly as we begin to kiss, his hand on my side and the other running itself through my hair, our tongues dance with one another as for this moment there is only the two of us.  
"我也爱你，薰。" 我们凝视着彼此的眼睛，就像刚才我和明日香那样，但这份凝视久久不散，因为我们俩都开始感到不确定。我们都还不习惯在公共场合表达亲昵，担心别人的看法，但随后...这可能是我短期内最后一次见到他了。如果现在不做，那么...我不想等上几个月。我向前一步，把手放在他的后脑勺上，将他拉向我。我们的嘴唇微微分开，开始接吻，他的手放在我的腰侧，另一只手穿过我的头发，我们的舌头相互缠绵，在这一刻，只有我们两个人。

"Guys... GUYS!" We break the kiss on hearing Asuka calling our name. I sheepishly step away and see her glaring at the two of us, without saying anything else she marches forward, takes out of me and kisses me for the same length and passion that I just kissed Kaworu. On breaking the kiss she playfully shoves me in the chest, "There, something for you to remember the both of us by, until we meet again and do the rest."  
"伙计们... 伙计们！" 听到明日香喊我们的名字，我们分开了吻。我尴尬地后退，看到她正瞪着我们俩，什么也没说就大步向前，把我拉过去，以同样的时长和热情吻了我，就像我刚才吻薰一样。分开时，她调皮地推了推我的胸口，"好了，这是让你记住我们俩的，直到我们再次见面，继续剩下的。"

I smile feeling redness coming to my cheeks, "Y-Yeah, it won't too long, will it?"  
我微笑着，感觉脸颊泛红，"是啊，不会太久的，对吧？"

She shakes her head, "No, it won't. I promise."  
她摇了摇头，“不，不会的。我保证。”

With those words she lets out a sigh and looks up at the departure times. Kaworu does the same before looking back at me, "We should... go. Goodbye Shinji."  
说完这些，她叹了口气，抬头查看出发时间。Kaworu 也做了同样的事，然后回头看我，“我们该……走了。再见，Shinji。”

"Goodbye." “再见。”

We say our goodbyes once again and share one final kiss between us before the two of them grab their luggage and begin to make their way further into the airport and away from me. All at once the burning of the tears in my eyes and the tightness in my chest returns as I see them get further away from me. I'm going to miss them both so much but I need to remind myself that this isn't the last time I'll see them.  
"我们再次道别，在两人拿起行李向机场深处走去，远离我之前，我们分享了最后一个吻。就在这一刻，眼中的泪水和胸口的紧绷感再次袭来，看着他们离我越来越远。我会非常想念他们，但我必须提醒自己，这不是最后一次见到他们。”

When they finally leave my sight, I turn and make my way out of the airport back to a waiting Misato. Despite the tears I'm blinking away I actually realize I'm smiling. I'm so lucky, at the start of this year I didn't think anyone could or would love me and now as Christmas and the New Year approaches I have two wonderful people who love me and I love those two so very much.  
当他们终于消失在我的视线中，我转身离开机场，回到等待着的美里身边。尽管我眨着泪水，却发现自己实际上在微笑。我真是太幸运了，今年初我从未想过会有人爱我，而现在随着圣诞节和新年的临近，我拥有了两位深爱我且我深爱着的人。

_Asuka... Kaworu... I will see you both soon. I promise.  
明日香...薰...我很快就会见到你们。我保证。_

**Notes:** Hi everyone, I've been fairly quiet whilst writing this story but we are now at the end of the piece. I'd just like to take this opportunity to say a massive thank you to everyone who has followed this story from beginning to the end. It's been a joy and a challenge to write.  
注：大家好，在写作这篇故事期间我相对沉默，但现在我们来到了结尾。我只想借此机会向每一位从开始到结束一直关注这个故事的人表示衷心的感谢。写作它既是一种乐趣，也是一次挑战。

It's also been scary at times to write, never really being too sure what the reaction would be to this sort of story. I didn't know if people would be angry at seeing this sort of thing be attempted, I didn't know if they'd laugh at it or just not bother with it. I'm very happy to see there are a few people out there who have liked it and stuck with it through to the conclusion though, it all means a hell of a lot to me.  
写作过程中也有过令人害怕的时刻，因为从未真正确定人们对这种故事会有什么反应。我不知道人们是否会对此感到愤怒，是否会嘲笑它，或者干脆不屑一顾。但我很高兴看到有少数人喜欢它，并坚持到了最后，这一切对我来说意义重大。

Initially this story was never going to be this long, it was originally going to be a pretty quick and easy 3 chapter WAFF piece but as I sketched out ideas for it I saw it could never be condensed into that. I felt I could do a lot of work in developing the characters more until it became this thing, and it is something I am very proud of, I just hope you all enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.  
起初，这个故事并没有打算写这么长，原本计划是一个简短轻松的三章温馨故事。但随着我为它构思想法，我发现它无法被压缩成那样。我觉得可以通过更多地发展角色来完成很多工作，直到它变成现在这样，我对此感到非常自豪。我只希望你们都能像我享受写作一样享受阅读它。

As far as this 'Ending' goes, this is pretty much the end of the story but there will be two epilogues that I'm currently writing. They won't be especially long pieces but they will tie up a couple of bits, so expect them in the next week or so. I just wanted to say something at this, the part I consider to be the end of the main story.  
至于这个‘结局’，这基本上是故事的结尾，但我目前正在写两个尾声。它们不会特别长，但会解决一些未了之事，预计下周左右会发布。我只想在这个我认为是主线故事结束的部分说些什么。

Once again, thank you so much for reading.  
再次感谢您的阅读。

### Chapter 29: Epilogue

**Epilogue 01 尾声 01**

**June 2022 - Kaworu Nagisa  
2022 年 6 月 - 渚薰**

I feel the tiniest rush of excitement as I finish taping up the large box, grab a marker and write albums 1970-1979 on the side of it. I have a smile on my face as I pick up the box, carry it into the living room and set it down amidst the myriad of similar size boxes that have already been taped up. It is strange for me to think that in just over a week from now, all of these boxes will be sitting in our new home in Japan, waiting for us to unpack them.  
当我用胶带封好这个大箱子，拿起一支马克笔在侧面写下“专辑 1970-1979”时，心中涌起一丝微小的兴奋。我面带微笑地提起箱子，搬进客厅，放在已经封好的众多大小相似的箱子中间。想到再过一周多一点，所有这些箱子都将静静地躺在我们在日本的新家里，等待我们拆封，这让我感到有些不可思议。

In fact, just over a week ago none of these boxes were here. All of their contents were scattered across our home as they have been for the last year or so. Our video games, our albums, our consoles and clothing were all in their appropriate places, or at least in some sort of place. We had full bookcases and wardrobes, drawers and shelves. In the corner of the living room was my keyboard, that was one of the first things to be packaged up, it now lies hidden with everything else.  
事实上，就在一周多以前，这些箱子还不存在。它们的内容物散落在我们家中各处，就像过去一年左右那样。我们的电子游戏、专辑、游戏机和衣物都各得其所，或者至少在某个地方。我们拥有满架的书籍和衣柜，抽屉和架子。客厅角落里是我的键盘，它是首批被打包的东西之一，现在和其他所有物品一起被隐藏起来。

We had photos up on the walls, pictures of me and Asuka, pictures of me and Shinji, of Asuka and Shinji and some of the three of us together. We had photos of friends and of our visit to Japan. We had framed pictures of the cover art for Asuka's novels. Now, all of that has been packed away, the walls and shelves are bare, as bare as they were when I first moved in. As bare as they were up until Asuka moved in and I started to learn how to be a little bit more human.  
墙上曾挂着我们的照片，有我和明日香，我和真嗣，还有明日香和真嗣以及我们三人的合影。我们还有朋友们的照片和去日本旅行的留影。明日香的小说封面艺术照也被装裱起来。如今，这一切都已被打包收起，墙壁和书架空空如也，就像我刚搬进来时那样。直到明日香搬进来，我开始学习如何变得更像一个普通人之前，它们都是如此空荡。

The personality... our stamp on this place has been removed, it is now ready for someone else to move in and leave their mark on it. I only hope that they're able to make as many happy memories here as the two of us have made.  
这里的个性痕迹……我们在这地方留下的印记已被抹去，现在它准备好迎接下一位住户，留下他们的痕迹。我只希望他们能在这里创造出和我们一样多的美好回忆。

I'm about to go back into the bedroom and see if I can maybe pack one more box, surely one of the last when the front door suddenly opens. I stop as I hear Asuka and Shinji calling down the hallway that they're back, the two of them enter the room and I greet them both with a kiss. Shinji is carrying two bags of food from a local fast food place, he sets it down on the kitchen counter, one of the few free spots left.  
我正准备回卧室看看是否还能再打包一个箱子，这肯定是最后几个之一时，前门突然开了。我停下脚步，听到明日香和真嗣在走廊里喊着他们回来了，两人走进房间，我分别给了他们一个吻。真嗣提着两袋当地快餐店的食物，他把袋子放在厨房仅剩的空位上。

"How did things go?" I ask eagerly as Shinji starts to get the food out fo the bag. I feel my stomach growl in response of the sight of the boxed burgers.  
"“事情怎么样了？”我急切地问道，看着真嗣开始从袋子里拿出食物。看到盒装汉堡，我的肚子不由自主地咕噜作响。”

"It went fine!" Asuka answers me as she enters the room, throws some documents down on the ground and snatches up her burger and fries. She shoves a box aside with her foot, sits herself down and flips the lid of the box open before pouring her fries into the lid. She takes a bite of the burger and continues to answer me whilst chewing, "Everything has been sorted, we spoke to the UN representative, they're not going to interfere and put any restrictions on you. Said they'll have some bodyguards nearby but it'll be minimal."  
"“一切顺利！”明日香一边回答我，一边走进房间，把一些文件扔在地上，抓起她的汉堡和薯条。她用脚把一个盒子踢到一边，坐了下来，打开盒盖，把薯条倒进盖子里。她咬了一口汉堡，边嚼边继续回答我，“所有事情都解决了，我们和联合国代表谈过了，他们不会干涉，也不会对你施加任何限制。说会在附近安排一些保镖，但会尽量减少。””

I let out a sigh of relief, "That is good, I must admit I was still a bit worried that perhaps-"  
"我松了一口气，“那真是太好了，我得承认，我之前还有点担心可能会……””

"You had nothing to worry about!" Asuka cuts me off and throws one of her fries at me, it hits me on my shoulder before annoying landing on the floor. I shoot her a glare as she continues, "It was cleared weeks ago! They said there would be no problems, today was just the final confirmation. Besides it's not like they could say no, I mean with Fuyutsuki retiring and going back to Japan you had no job here. Ritsuko has already said the school she works at has a full-time position for a music teacher so it was perfect."  
"你根本不用担心！" 明日香打断我，朝我扔了一根薯条，它打在我的肩膀上，然后恼人地落在地板上。我瞪了她一眼，她继续说："几周前就澄清了！他们说不会有问题，今天只是最后的确认。再说了，他们也不可能拒绝，我是说，冬月退休回日本了，你在这里也没工作了。律子已经说了，她工作的学校有一个全职音乐教师的职位，这再合适不过了。"

"I understand that." I answer her as I pick up the fry from the floor and put it in the bin, "But given their opposition to me going to Japan last time, I did worry that perhaps they would rescind their prior approval."  
"我明白这一点。" 我回答她，同时从地板上捡起那根薯条，放进垃圾桶，"但考虑到他们上次反对我去日本，我确实担心他们可能会撤销之前的批准。"

Asuka shrugs, "They were being idiots back then though, weren't they? Besides you proved them all wrong! We were there for a few weeks and you didn't do anything bad, no explosions, no creepy levitation, no hijacking giant robots, all fine! Tell him Shinji!"  
明日香耸耸肩，"那时候他们就是一群白痴，不是吗？再说了，你已经证明他们错了！我们在那里待了几周，你什么坏事都没做，没有爆炸，没有诡异的漂浮，没有劫持巨型机器人，一切都很好！告诉他是的，真嗣！"

I turn to Shinji, who has so far stayed out of the conversation and is instead focused on dipping a chicken nugget into a pot of sauce. He looks between the two of us and nods, "A-Asuka is right Kaworu. I don't think you had anything to worry about. I mean they already allowed us to buy the house and sort out your immigration, it would have been weird to turn you down now."  
我转向真嗣，他一直没参与对话，而是专注于将一块鸡块蘸进酱汁里。他来回看着我们俩，点头道：“明日香说得对，薰。我觉得你没必要担心。我是说，他们已经同意我们买下房子并处理你的移民手续了，现在再拒绝你才奇怪呢。”

"I suppose... but you cannot blame me for being concerned. I still do... not trust those people."  
“我想也是……但你不能怪我担心。我还是……不太信任那些人。”

"Neither do I!" Asuka adds, "But they know better than to mess us about with stuff like this. Look, forget about them for now. Focus on us and what we're doing, focus on getting the rest of this stuff packed up and then tomorrow it'll get shipped away. We go next week and move into our own place... the three of us."  
“我也不信任！”明日香补充道，“但他们知道在这种事上糊弄我们没好处。听着，暂时别管他们了。专注于我们自己和我们正在做的事，集中精力把剩下的东西打包，然后明天运走。我们下周就搬进自己的地方……我们三个。”

I smile as she says that, "You are right... Thank you."  
她这么说时，我微笑着回应：“你说得对……谢谢你。”

I take this as an opportunity to grab my food from the bag but also to reflect on how quickly we have gotten to this point. I think it's been a lot faster than any of us anticipated but then again, the last few months have also been harder than we anticipated. Neither me or Asuka were able to find an opportunity to go back to Japan over those months and Shinji was only able to fly out to see us twice before now.  
我趁机从包里拿出食物，同时也反思我们是如何迅速走到这一步的。我想这比我们任何人预想的都要快，但话说回来，过去几个月也比我们预想的要艰难。我和明日香都没能找到机会回日本，而真嗣在此之前只飞来看过我们两次。

There have been some arguments, there has been some upsets and a need to reassure one another greatly over the last few months but another thing was confirmed, we all do love each other, deeply and passionately. We speak pretty much every day and we're always sending each other photos and updates and there have even been a few... intimate moments shared across the internet with each other.  
过去几个月里，我们有过争执，有过不快，需要彼此大力安抚，但另一件事得到了确认：我们确实深爱着对方，深情而热烈。我们几乎每天都在交流，互相发送照片和更新，甚至还有几次……通过网络分享了亲密时刻。

Next week I begin to write a new chapter in my life with these two amazing people. I feel so lucky and I hope I can give them half as much happiness as what they bring me. Once I feared the future but now not so much, because I get to share it with them and I would have it no other way.  
下周，我将和这两位非凡的人一起，开启我人生中的新篇章。我感到无比幸运，并希望我能给予他们一半的幸福，就像他们带给我的那样。曾经我害怕未来，但现在不再那么担忧，因为我能与他们共享这段旅程，除此之外别无他求。

**Epilogue 02 尾声 02**

I glance upwards at the apartment block and then back down at the address written on the small strip of paper. Maybe I shouldn't have done but I called in a favour to help me track down this place, unless they got it very wrong then it seems things have gone very well for Nurse Makinami over the last fifteen years. These aren't just high-end apartments, these are the sorts of places reserved for the elite. I'm sure if I hung around long enough, I'd probably run into a movie or pop star of some sort, either that or get escorted off of the premises for being creepy.  
我抬头看了一眼公寓楼，然后又低头确认纸条上的地址。或许我不该这么做，但我动用了人情来帮我找到这个地方。除非他们搞错了，否则过去十五年里，真希波护士似乎过得相当不错。这些不仅仅是高档公寓，而是专为精英阶层保留的住所。我敢肯定，如果我在这里逗留足够久，很可能会遇到某个电影明星或流行歌手，要么就是被保安以可疑为由请出去。

Nurse Makinami, she is the reason I am here. It was a dumb suggestion by Kaworu that took root in my mind. This idea that I should maybe make an effort to tie up any loose ends I had here. I had mentioned recently to him that she was the one person who was really kinda to me when Mama was in hospital, and that I would like to say thank you if I could, especially given that she gave me my pen name. He said I should do it, given our connections it wouldn't be hard to locate her even if that would be a bit... unscrupulous.  
真希波护士，是她让我来到这里的。是渚薰的一个愚蠢建议在我心中生根发芽。这个想法是，我或许应该努力解决在这里的任何未了之事。我最近向他提到，妈妈住院时，她是唯一真正对我好的人，如果可能的话，我想向她道谢，尤其是她给了我笔名。他说我应该这么做，鉴于我们的关系，找到她并不难，尽管这可能会有些……不择手段。

I walk straight ahead into the lobby of the block. It's a far cry from what I'm used to in these areas, it's well maintained, there are paintings up on the wall and plants scattered around. It looks nice, like a luxury hotel. There is some seating set up, around a table littered with high end fashion or car magazines. A coffee machine stands in the corner and a locked door blocks the way to the elevators and stairs.  
我径直走进大楼的大堂。这与我在这片区域习惯的环境大相径庭，这里维护得很好，墙上挂着画，四周散落着植物。看起来很漂亮，像一家豪华酒店。有些座位围绕着一张堆满高端时尚或汽车杂志的桌子。角落里有一台咖啡机，一扇上锁的门挡住了通往电梯和楼梯的路。

To my left is a reception desk, standing behind it is a short and slightly snobbish looking man, his features reminding me very much of the detective Hercule Poirot. I approach and make myself known, "Hello, excuse me."  
在我左边是一个接待台，站在后面的是一个矮小且略显势利的男人，他的特征让我想起了侦探赫尔克里·波洛。我走上前去，自报家门，“你好，打扰一下。”

I get no reply, as he continues to look down at some booklets, I repeat myself only this time speaking a little bit louder. This does get his attention and he gives a little sniff and turns his head to look at me. He looks me up and down and I see his eyes narrow. I already get the impression he doesn't think too much of me, not that his opinion matters.  
我没有得到回复，因为他继续低头看着一些小册子，我只好再次重复，这次稍微提高了音量。这终于引起了他的注意，他轻轻地哼了一声，转过头来看着我。他上下打量了我一番，我注意到他的眼睛眯了起来。我已经有种感觉，他对我评价不高，不过他的看法并不重要。

"Can I help you?" He speaks with a forced posh accent and doesn't even try to mask the disdain in his voice.  
“有什么能帮到您的吗？”他用一种刻意装出的高贵口音说道，丝毫没有掩饰声音中的轻蔑。

"Yes, you can, I'm looking for Miss Mari Makinami." I explain, "I was told that she lives here in number eight."  
“是的，可以，我在找真希波·真理·真希波小姐。”我解释道，“我听说她住在八号这里。”

"I am sorry but I cannot help you, as you can see." He points to a sign on the wall behind him, "We have a strict policy restricting sales people, political campaigning or other unannounced visitors. As you can imagine we host a particular sort of clientele here, most of whom for their own protection do not wish to be disturbed. If you are here to make a mail delivery, please go to the mail building around the corner and they will handle it."  
"很抱歉，但我无法帮助你，正如你所见。" 他指向身后墙上的一个标志，"我们有一项严格的规定，禁止销售人员、政治宣传或其他未经宣布的访客。你可以想象，我们这里接待的是特定类型的客户，他们中的大多数出于自身保护，不希望被打扰。如果你是来送邮件的，请去拐角处的邮局大楼，他们会处理。"

"Ah no, you don't understand..." I try to remain calm whilst speaking to him, "I'm not here to sell anything or deliver anything. I know... well I knew her some time ago. I wanted to speak to her."  
"啊不，你误会了..." 我试图保持冷静地对他说，"我不是来卖东西或送东西的。我认识...嗯，我很久以前认识她。我想和她谈谈。"

"Mm-hmm..." I can tell by the tone of his voice and the look I'm getting that he doesn't believe me, I can also say that it's taking a lot for me to not dive over the table to tear the moustache from his face, "And how exactly do you know Miss Makinami?"  
"嗯哼..." 从他的语气和看我的眼神，我能感觉到他不相信我，我也能感觉到自己正努力克制着不越过桌子去扯掉他的胡子，"那么，你究竟是怎么认识真希波小姐的？"

"I..." I don't, but I also didn't expect to deal with the door attendant from hell. I also don't really want to be revealing any details of my past to someone like him, "I was a patient of hers when she was a nurse."  
"我..." 我不愿意，但也没料到会遇到这个地狱般的门卫。我也不想向他透露任何关于我过去的细节，"我曾是她的病人，那时她还是一名护士。"

It's a simple lie but he does seem to actually think about it. I decide to add more to my story just to see if I can push this a bit further, "My name is Asuka Langley Soryu, the name will mean something to her."  
这是个简单的谎言，但他似乎真的在思考。我决定给我的故事再加点料，看看能否再推进一些，"我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷，这个名字对她来说应该有意义。"

"I doubt that." He answers, "It means very little to me, and as mentioned we have strict policies in place that I am not willing to bend for the likes of you."  
"我对此表示怀疑。"他回答道，"这个名字对我来说毫无意义，而且如前所述，我们有严格的规定，我不会为你这样的人破例。"

"Now listen here you, I didn't fi-" I'm about to launch full pelt into a rant based on how I fought oversized creatures in an attempt to save this world and therefore people like him to be treated like this when I'm thankfully cut off by the sounds of a woman clearing her throat.  
"现在听好了，我可没——" 我正准备全力爆发一场关于我如何与巨型生物战斗以拯救这个世界，从而拯救像他这样的人，却遭到如此对待的牢骚，幸好被一位女士清嗓子的声音打断了。

"What is going on here?" I turn my head to see the source of the voice and see a grinning woman in her mid-forties standing in the entrance of the lobby. She's clutching a carrier bag from a local supermarket and from here I can see the bright pink rim of her glasses. She has long brown hair and her eyes seem to be focused on me.  
"这里发生了什么事？" 我转头看向声音的来源，只见一位四十多岁的女士站在大厅入口处，脸上挂着笑容。她手里提着当地超市的购物袋，从这里我能看到她眼镜框鲜艳的粉红色。她留着长长的棕色头发，目光似乎集中在我的身上。

"Ah, Miss Makinami, I was just telling this person of our visitor policies. They claim that they know you, but I am certain that cannot be the case."  
"啊，真希波小姐，我正在向这个人解释我们的访客政策。他们声称认识您，但我确信那是不可能的。"

My words get stuck in my throat as I take in the sight of the woman before me, this is Nurse Makinami, this is the woman I came to visit. It's not really going as I imagined. She continues to look at me and then I see the flash of recognition in her eyes, the grin fades only to be left with a shocked expression, "A-Asuka... It's... really you?"  
"我的话卡在喉咙里，当我看到眼前的女人时，她是真希波护士，是我来探望的那个人。事情并没有像我想象的那样发展。她继续看着我，然后我看到了她眼中的认出我的闪光，笑容消失，只剩下震惊的表情，“A-明日香...真的是你？””

I'm half tempted to laugh and gloat at the stunned mock Poirot next to me but all I can do is nod feebly, "Y-Yeah... You, remember who I am?"  
"我一半想笑，对旁边震惊的假波洛炫耀一番，但只能无力地点头，“嗯...你，还记得我是谁吗？””

"Of course! Of course I remember you!" She answers, "I just... never thought I'd see you again. It's been a long time. Please, come on up."  
"“当然！我当然记得你！”她回答，“我只是...从没想过会再见到你。已经很久了。请上来吧。””

She moves into the lobby and swipes her card at the door leading to the elevators and again at the elevator. I shoot the receptionist a slight grin before following closely behind Mari, slightly stunned that she does actually remember who I am. Now that I'm here I find myself at a loss of what exactly to do. Like most things I'd just kinda gone in without a plan.  
她走进大厅，在通往电梯的门前刷了卡，又在电梯前再次刷卡。我向接待员微微一笑，然后紧跟在玛丽身后，有些惊讶她居然真的记得我是谁。现在我站在这里，却发现自己不知该做什么。像大多数事情一样，我只是没有计划地就闯了进来。

The elevator door closes and the journey to her floor begins. For a time, we're silent and I take the chance to look her over and also peek inside the shopping bag. She is smiling again and I have to admit she isn't quite what I expected. Between the grin, the way she stands, her clothing choices and the bag full of beer and instant miles I'm reminded very much of Misato.  
电梯门关闭，开始向她的楼层上升。一段时间内，我们沉默不语，我趁机打量她，并偷偷瞄了一眼购物袋。她再次微笑，我不得不承认，她与我的预期有些不同。她的笑容、站姿、衣着选择，以及装满啤酒和速食面的袋子，都让我想起了美里。

"So, how did you find me?" She finally speaks as the elevator reaches its destination, "Was it Fuyutsuki?"  
“那么，你是怎么找到我的？”电梯到达目的地时，她终于开口问道，“是冬月吗？”

As we step out, I find myself caught in a stunned silence as she continues to grin, "Bet you're wondering how I know that name, aren't you?"  
当我们走出去时，我发现自己陷入了震惊的沉默，她继续笑着说，“你一定在想我是怎么知道那个名字的，对吧？”

I nod my head and follow her through the luxurious corridor towards her apartment, "Yeah, I am and no... it wasn't him."  
我点点头，跟着她穿过豪华的走廊走向她的公寓，“是的，我确实好奇，而且……不是他。”

"Oh well, I would have expected..." She laughs as she reaches her door, "I suppose that can wait. I guess I'm probably not what you expected, am I?"  
“哦，好吧，我本以为……”她笑着走到自己的门前，“我想那可以稍后再说。我猜我可能和你想象的不太一样，是吗？”

"Well... I guess not." I admit to her, "I mean... I don't want to be rude but... this isn't really a place you can get on a nurse's salary and seeing as you know who Fuyutsuki is... I'm guessing you weren't a normal nurse."  
"嗯...我想不是。" 我向她承认，"我的意思是...我不想无礼，但是...这不是一个靠护士薪水能负担得起的地方，而且既然你知道谁是冬月...我猜你不是个普通的护士。"

"No, I wasn't." She laughs.  
"没错，我不是。" 她笑道。"

I take a moment to try to let the shock of learning that sink in. For so long I thought her being kind to me was just a random act of kindness from a random nurse and now it seems like she was tied into everything as well. This spur of the moment decision has given me more questions than I had before. I wasn't prepared for this! I was just going to say thank you to her and explain how I stole her name for my pseudonym.  
我花了一会儿时间试图消化这个令人震惊的消息。这么长时间以来，我一直以为她对我的善意只是来自一个普通护士的随机善举，现在看来她似乎也与这一切有关。这个即兴的决定让我产生了比之前更多的问题。我完全没有准备好面对这些！我原本只是打算向她道谢，并解释我是如何偷用她的名字作为我的笔名的。

There is a small voice in the back of my head telling me that something could also be very wrong. I look up and down the corridor once again for anything strange. If Mari knows who Fuyutsuki is in relation to me then who exactly is she? Was she a friend or foe? NERV, SEELE or someone else? She didn't come into having this place off the back of a lottery win, so what exactly was she?  
脑海深处有个细小的声音在提醒我，事情可能也出了大错。我再次上下打量走廊，寻找任何异常之处。如果玛丽知道福音津与我的关系，那么她究竟是谁？她是敌是友？是 NERV、SEELE 还是其他人？她并非靠彩票中奖获得这个地方，那她究竟是什么来头？

I follow her cautiously into the apartment itself, I feel slightly calmer at the sight of it, the main living space is as big as I expected, actually covering two floors a corridor off to the side for what I presume are the bedrooms and bathrooms. The view is spectacular, giving a great view of the city. Inside is slightly less tidy, empty beer cans are left on bits of furniture, I spot empty plates, and some discarded underwear.  
我小心翼翼地跟着她进入公寓，看到内部景象后，我感到稍微平静了些。主要生活空间比我想象的还要大，实际上占据了两个楼层，旁边有一条走廊，我猜那里是卧室和浴室。视野极佳，能俯瞰整个城市。室内略显凌乱，家具上散落着空啤酒罐，我注意到还有空盘子和一些丢弃的内衣。

"Sorry about the mess." She announces, without any shame as she leads me through the living room into the open kitchen. It's the sort of kitchen Shinji would love to cook in but I imagine, based on the amount of instant food here, that most of it goes unused. I also imagine that the amount of mess and unwashed dishes would give Shinji a heart attack, "I don't normally get visitors."  
"抱歉这里有点乱。" 她毫无羞愧地宣布，领着我穿过客厅进入开放式厨房。这种厨房大概是真嗣梦寐以求的烹饪场所，但根据这里堆积的速食食品数量，我想大部分厨具都闲置着。我还想象，这堆满未洗碗碟的混乱场面足以让真嗣心脏病发作，"我平时很少有访客。"

"It's fine." I say, my eyes are quickly drawn to a calendar on the wall and I feel myself blush as the sight of a woman with large exposed breasts and tight black leggings straddling another topless woman wearing tight red leggings greets me.  
"没关系。" 我说，目光迅速被墙上的日历吸引，看到一个胸部丰满、穿着紧身黑 leggings 的女人跨坐在另一个穿着紧身红 leggings 的半裸女人身上，我不禁脸红起来。

"You look like you have some questions, can I offer you some tea?"  
"你看起来有些疑问，要不要来点茶？"

I nod and she starts fills up a kettle and puts it on before pulling out two clean mugs from a cupboard. As I watch her, I try to think of something to say, I didn't really know what I was going to say in the first place but now I have more questions.  
我点点头，她便开始烧水，放上水壶，然后从橱柜里拿出两个干净的杯子。我看着她，试图找些话题，其实一开始我也没想好要说什么，但现在我有更多问题了。

"I'm sorry for calling in like this. Your... receptionist seemed quite offended by me."  
“很抱歉这样突然打电话来。你的……前台接待员似乎对我很不满。”

Mari lets out a laugh, "Oh ignore him, he's little more than a snob, all about the status and being seen with the right people. If he knew who you truly were then he'd change his tune. The world owes a lot to you, but I'm sure you've probably heard that before."  
玛丽笑出声来，“哦，别理他，他不过是个势利眼，满脑子都是地位和与合适的人交往。如果他知道你真正的身份，他肯定会改变态度的。这个世界欠你很多，不过我敢肯定你以前也听过这种话。”

I nod and smirk, "Maybe once or twice."  
我点头并轻笑，“或许一两次吧。”

"I wish I could have prevented all of that." She frowns as she sets down one of the cups of tea in front of me. She pulls a carton of milk out of the fridge, I add a touch to my tea and continue to listen as she speaks, "I tried but..."  
“我真希望我能阻止这一切。”她皱着眉，将一杯茶放在我面前。她从冰箱里拿出一盒牛奶，我往茶里加了点，继续听她说话，“我试过但……”

"Wait..." I interrupt her, "What do you mean you tried?"  
“等等……”我打断她，“你说的试过是什么意思？”

"Exactly what I said." She explains, "I guess there was little I could do at the time, after all I wasn't supposed to do anything that'd make me stand out and I suppose helping to orchestrate the disappearance of the prime candidate for the Evangelion project would have hurt that but I did try."  
“正是我说的那样。”她解释道，“我想当时我确实无能为力，毕竟我不该做任何引人注目的事，而帮助策划使 EVA 计划的首选候选人消失，无疑会破坏这一点，但我确实尝试过。”

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because I made a promise to your mother, that I would protect you." Her words hit me with the force of a fly hitting the windshield of a car. I can barely hear her say the next part, "And I am so sorry that I failed in that promise."  
“因为我曾向你母亲承诺，我会保护你。”她的话语如同一颗撞上汽车挡风玻璃的苍蝇般有力。我几乎听不清她接下来的话，“而我非常抱歉，我没有履行那个承诺。”

"Y-You... knew my mother?"  
“你……你认识我母亲？”

She nods solemnly, "I knew her... and I knew Yui as well. I met them both just before you were born, the three of us were friends. Look at this."  
她郑重地点头，“我认识她……也认识 Yui。在你出生前，我们三人曾是朋友。看这个。”

I watch as she makes her way over to a bookshelf in the front room and takes a photo down from it. She hands me the photo and I take it with trembling hands. It's hard for me to suppress the gasp when I see the three people on it. In the middle is a much younger Mari and to each side is my mother and Shinji's mother.  
我看着她走向前厅的书架，从上面取下一张照片。她把照片递给我，我颤抖着手接过。看到照片上的三个人时，我几乎抑制不住惊呼。中间是年轻的 Mari，两边分别是我的母亲和 Shinji 的母亲。

"This is..." I trail off and look up at Mari. Once again, I'm reminded of Misato in how she has gone from a lighthearted grin to deadly serious.  
“这是……”我话音未落，抬头看向 Mari。又一次，我被提醒到 Misato 的变化，从轻松的笑容变得极度严肃。

"That was taken about half a year before Yui disappeared and of course before your mother died." Mari informs me, "It was the last time the three of us were together, that was when I promised your mother I'd look after you."  
"那张照片是在 Yui 消失前大约半年拍的，当然也是在你的母亲去世之前。" Mari 告诉我，"那是我们三人最后一次在一起，那时我答应你的母亲会照顾你。"

"Were you part of Gehirn?"  
"你曾是 Gehirn 的一员吗？"

"Not quite." She takes the photo from me and sets it down on the kitchen counter as she continues to explain, "I probably shouldn't show you that or tell you any of this but... you have a right to know. I was part of a special UN division tasked with investigating the truth of Second Impact. We wanted to prevent anything like that happening again and bring the culprits to justice. My orders were to infiltrate, find out what I could and if necessary... remove those responsible."  
"不完全算是。" 她从我手中接过照片，放在厨房的台面上，继续解释道，"我本不该给你看这个，也不该告诉你这些，但是...你有权知道。我曾是联合国一个特别部门的一员，负责调查第二次冲击的真相。我们想要防止类似事件再次发生，并将罪魁祸首绳之以法。我的任务是潜入，尽可能获取信息，必要时...清除那些责任人。"

"Remove y-you mean... kill?" I feel my stomach start to churn as I speak those words. When I came here today I expected to find a nurse in her mid-forties, not some ex-agent of the UN. I feel even worse when she nods.  
"你是说...杀掉？" 我说出这些话时，胃里开始翻江倒海。今天来这里，我本以为会见到一个四五十岁的护士，而不是什么联合国的前特工。当她点头时，我感到更加难受。

"If needed then yes, I was to kill." She confirms, "Not that it matters, the division was only a smokescreen. It was set up to give those with any doubts the impression that something was happening. What we didn't realize then was that SEELE practically controlled the UN so it was all set up in their favour."  
"如果需要的话，是的，我会执行击杀任务。" 她确认道，"不过这并不重要，那个部门只是一个烟幕弹。设立它是为了给那些有疑虑的人一种正在发生什么的错觉。我们当时没有意识到，SEELE 几乎控制了联合国，所以这一切都是为了他们的利益而设定的。"

"Did my mother know what you were?" I ask her, whilst making an effort to maintain my composure. I feel a little bit dizzy with what I'm suddenly learning.  
"我母亲知道你是做什么的吗？" 我努力保持镇定地问她。突然间得知的这一切让我感到有些头晕。

"She and Yui knew." Mari explains, "Neither of them wanted Third Impact to happen and they knew that because of their work it would happen. They figured out what I was and came to be on their own. It was because of them I learned just how much control SEELE truly had. They helped me out, got me into places I wouldn't have been able to, shown me things I was never supposed to see, at great risk to themselves and to you and Shinji."  
"她和 Yui 知道。" 玛丽解释道，"她们俩都不希望第三次冲击发生，也知道因为她们的工作会导致这一结果。她们弄清楚了我的身份，主动找上门来。正是因为她们，我才知道 SEELE 真正的掌控力有多大。她们帮了我，让我进入了一些原本无法涉足的地方，向我展示了那些本不该看到的东西，这给她们自己以及你和真嗣带来了巨大的风险。"

I feel some pride at hearing that and make a note to tell Shinji later. I always liked to imagine that my mother would have tried to resist SEELE and I know Shinji feels a similar way about his mother. Most of the information relating to the two of them has been erased so we've never known the full truth. I'm kinda proud to know that she did try to resist.  
听到这些，我感到一丝自豪，并记下稍后要告诉真嗣。我一直想象我的母亲会试图抵抗 SEELE，我知道真嗣对他母亲也有类似的感受。关于她们两人的大部分信息都被抹去了，所以我们从未了解全部真相。知道她确实尝试过抵抗，我感到有些骄傲。

"Unfortunately, something went wrong, I guess they saw how close I was to the two of them and our mission was suddenly halted. Not long after that Yui vanished and... well you know what happened to your mother." She lowers her head, "Before she was forced to do the test, I promised her that I'd do what I could to look after you. I was going to try to get you moved elsewhere."  
"不幸的是，我想是她们察觉到我和她们的关系过于密切，我们的任务突然被中止了。不久后，Yui 消失了，而...你也知道你母亲发生了什么。" 她低下头，"在她被迫进行测试之前，我向她承诺，我会尽我所能照顾你。我本打算设法将你转移到别处。"

"What happened?" I try to imagine any sort of life different to the one I had. Who would I have become if I had been taken away from that situation? Would I have finally come to terms with what happened to my mother? Would I have been better adjusted? At the same time, my life... and my past is what made me the person I am now. I am better adjusted now, I have come to terms with what happened to my mother. I'm at that place, but it just took me a bit longer to get here.  
"发生了什么？" 我试图想象一种与我过去截然不同的生活。如果我从那个环境中被带走，我会变成什么样的人？我是否最终能接受母亲发生的事情？我会不会更适应？与此同时，我的生活...和我的过去塑造了现在的我。我现在更适应了，我已经接受了母亲的事情。我到达了那个地方，只是花了我更长的时间。

"I tried... I had a plan to sneak you out when you were at the hospital and get you to America, some small town where you could blend in and no one would find you but..."  
"我试过...我有个计划，在你住院时偷偷把你带出来，送到美国的一个小镇，在那里你可以融入人群，没人会找到你，但是..."

"That would have been impossible, wouldn't it?" I ask, knowing full well her plan wouldn't have worked.  
"那是不可能的，对吧？" 我问道，心里清楚她的计划根本行不通。

She shakes her head, "Yeah, it would. As soon as your mother had the accident, they doubled the security on you and drew up plans to get you away as soon as possible. They also had me moved away from Germany as quickly as they could."  
她摇了摇头，“是的，会的。你母亲一出事，他们就加倍了你的安保，并制定了尽快带你离开的计划。他们也尽快把我从德国转移走了。”

"And after that?" “那之后呢？”

"After that... Well, I knew something was rotten with the UN and I made it my goal to try to expose the truth. A couple of us banded together and started pursuing leads and recruiting others. Through... blind luck I guess, we were able to get eyes on NERV and SEELE again and more importantly for me both yourself and Shinji but... we were always too goddamn late."  
“那之后……嗯，我知道联合国那边有问题，于是我决心揭露真相。我们几个人联合起来，开始追查线索并招募其他人。多亏了……算是瞎猫碰上死耗子吧，我们得以再次监视 NERV 和 SEELE，更重要的是，我和你以及真嗣都重新取得了联系，但……我们总是他妈的太迟了。”

There is a bitterness to her voice, one that I understand. I've always thought back to those times, if only I'd have been a bit smarter or if I'd have questioned things a bit more but I was so eager to play the good solider in pursuit of validation that I never stopped to actually think. I know that none of that is my fault though, I did what I could with what I had.  
她的声音中带着一丝苦涩，我感同身受。我总是回想起那些时光，如果当时我能更聪明一些，或者多质疑一些事情就好了，但我太急于扮演一个好士兵，追求认可，以至于从未停下来真正思考。尽管如此，我知道这些都不是我的错，我已经尽力而为。

"You did what you could." I weakly throw out.  
“你已经尽力了。”我无力地回应道。

"I know." She nods, "We all did, some of us died for that cause. Your former guardian, Ryoji Kaji was one of my men."  
“我知道。”她点头，“我们都尽力了，有些人甚至为此献出了生命。你的前任监护人，碇源堂，就是我手下的一员。”

"You knew Kaji?" I ask and again she nods to confirm.  
"你知道加治吗？" 我问道，她再次点头确认。

"Yeah, he helped me keep an eye on the two of you. He lost a lot during the Second Impact and I think he was more desperate than any of us were to expose the truth."  
"是的，他帮我留意你们两个。他在第二次冲击中失去了很多，我想他比我们任何人都更渴望揭露真相。"

"Idiot." I snarl out the word angrily.  
"白痴。" 我愤怒地咆哮出这个词。

Mari laughs, "Yeah, he is. He... certainly is. Losing him was one of my biggest regrets, I know how much he cared for you and Shinji and I... know how much you cared for him."  
玛丽笑了，“是啊，他是。他……确实如此。失去他是我最大的遗憾之一，我知道他对你和真嗣有多在乎，我也……知道你有多在乎他。”

Mari grins as I feel a blush come to my cheeks, I'm instantly reminded of how ridiculous I used to act around Kaji, a pathetic example of a childhood crush. I expect Mari knows all about that, I just wonder how much Kaji told her.  
玛丽咧嘴一笑，我感到脸颊泛起红晕，立刻想起了自己过去在加持面前是多么可笑，一个可怜的童年暗恋的例子。我猜玛丽对此了如指掌，只是不知道加持告诉了她多少。

"I was..." “我曾经……”

She laughs, "No need to explain, we've all got our fantasies and crushes, I mean if you knew what went through my mind around Shinji's mother. I mean she was beautiful! I would have loved to pin her down an..."  
她笑着说：“不用解释，我们都有自己的幻想和迷恋对象，我是说，如果你知道我脑海里对真嗣的母亲有过什么想法。我是说她真的很美！我真想把她按住……”

Mari trails off as she gets a glimpse of my reddening face and what I am sure is a very shocked expression. I'm just glad Shinji isn't here to hear this woman talking about her fantasies about his mother. She shrugs, "Probably a discussion for another... more drunken time."  
玛丽看到我涨红的脸和肯定是非常震惊的表情，便停了下来。幸好真嗣不在这里，听不到这个女人谈论她对他母亲的幻想。她耸耸肩，“这可能更适合在另一个……更醉的时候讨论。”

"Y-Yeah..." I shuffle my feet in discomfort and weakly try to steer the conversation elsewhere, "What do you do now?"  
“呃，是啊……”我尴尬地挪动着脚步，试图弱弱地转移话题，“你现在做什么工作？”

"Nothing." She shakes her head, "I saved up a lot during my time and was given a lot after it for my efforts so I'm mostly retired now. I had considered writing a book but it... seems someone has already written one for me."  
"没什么。" 她摇摇头，"我在那段时间里攒了不少钱，后来也因为我的努力得到了很多，所以现在基本上算是退休了。我曾考虑过写本书，但……似乎已经有人替我写好了。"

She flashes me a knowing grin and I once again feel some discomfort, "Ah... Actually, that was one reason I was here."  
她朝我露出一个会意的微笑，我再次感到些许不安，"啊……实际上，我来这里的一个原因就是这个。"

"Go on..." "继续说……"

"When... my mother had her accident everyone at that hospital was... well they didn't really seem to care. You were, the only person who really took the time to speak to me or be with me, I always remembered that. So, when I wrote the book I didn't want to use my actual name, you know I didn't want someone to figure out who I was and I didn't want the publicity so I thought I'd... name it after the one adult who was kind to me back then."  
"当...我母亲发生意外时，那家医院的每个人都...嗯，他们似乎并不怎么关心。而你，是唯一一个真正花时间与我交谈或陪伴我的人，我一直记得这一点。所以，当我写这本书时，我不想使用我的真实姓名，你知道，我不想让别人猜出我是谁，也不想引起公众注意，于是我想...以当时唯一对我友善的成年人来命名它。"

"I see..." The smile fades from her face, "I... don't know what to say to that. Thank you."  
"我明白了..." 她脸上的笑容消失了，"我...不知道该说什么。谢谢你。"

"I haven't... caused you any trouble have I?" I ask her and she shakes her head.  
"我没有...给你带来什么麻烦吧？" 我问她，她摇了摇头。

"No, not at all. If anything I'm quite amused when I'm asked about it. It was a bit of a shock when I first heard of the book, wondered if maybe I got too drunk one night and became a literary genius. Would have been a kick in the face to my old teachers." She is back to grinning again, "I am honored Asuka. You know, your mother would be very proud of what you've become. She always wanted a creative child, if I remember correctly, she was very much into her music."  
"不，一点也不。如果有什么的话，当被问及此事时我反而觉得挺有趣。第一次听说那本书时，我确实有点震惊，甚至怀疑自己是不是某晚喝多了，摇身一变成了文学天才。那可真是给以前的老师们一记响亮的耳光。" 她又露出了笑容，"我很荣幸，Asuka。你知道吗，你的母亲会为你现在的成就感到非常骄傲。我记得她一直希望有个富有创造力的孩子，她对音乐非常热爱。"

"Yeah, I got her record collection." I laugh.  
"是啊，我继承了她的唱片收藏。" 我笑着说。"

"Is that all you have of her?"  
"你就只有她的唱片吗？"

"Yeah, my father... took the rest, same with Shinji's father. Neither of us have much of our mothers really."  
“是啊，我父亲……带走了剩下的部分，真嗣的父亲也一样。我们俩都没怎么真正了解过自己的母亲。”

Mari frowns but then suddenly leaves the room and heads towards a cabinet in the living room. She returns with a photo album and hands it to me, "Here, this isn't... well it isn't much. It's a few photos of my time with them. I can get them copied for you but it'll be for the both of you, to see your mothers as they were."  
玛丽皱了皱眉，但突然离开了房间，走向客厅的一个柜子。她拿着一本相册回来，递给我，“给，这不算……嗯，不算什么。里面有几张我和她们在一起时的照片。我可以帮你们复制一份，这样你们俩都能看到你们的母亲当年的样子。”

My hands are trembling as I take the album from her. I open it and start to look through, I try to stem the tears as I see the photos of mine and Shinji's mother. I smile as I turn to one page and see Shinji's mother holding who I presume to be a baby Shinji in her arms, the next page shows Mari and my mother smiling, and the photo after that shows a very nervous looking Mari holding a baby with bright red hair in her arms.  
我颤抖着手从她那里接过相册。我打开它，开始翻看，努力忍住泪水，看着我和真嗣母亲的照片。我微笑着翻到一页，看到真嗣的母亲抱着一个我认为是婴儿时期的真嗣，下一页是玛丽和我母亲微笑的照片，再下一张照片上，玛丽紧张地抱着一个有着鲜红色头发的婴儿。

"You threw up on me shortly after that one was taken." Mari groans, "I was never any good around children."  
"那张照片拍完后不久你就吐了我一身。" 玛丽叹息道，"我从来就不擅长应付小孩子。"

I laugh as I continue to leaf through the booklet, more photos pass me by until I get to one page and stop. This photo is of Mari but it isn't like the others. This doesn't include me or Shinji, nor does it include our mothers. Instead Mari is a couple of years old and with her is a kid, maybe about seven or eight. They seem to be in a very posh and old looking room.  
我笑着继续翻阅小册子，更多的照片从我眼前掠过，直到我翻到某一页停了下来。这张照片是玛丽的，但与其他的不同。这里没有我或真嗣，也没有我们的母亲。相反，玛丽只有几岁大，旁边是一个大约七八岁的孩子。他们似乎在一个非常豪华且古色古香的房间里。

The photo itself would probably be unremarkable if it weren't for the look of the child. Pale white skin, bright red eyes and silver hair, this is her and Kaworu. She knew Kaworu as well!  
这张照片本身可能并不引人注目，如果不是因为那个孩子的样子。苍白的皮肤，鲜红的眼睛和银色的头发，这是她和渚薰。她也认识渚薰！

"Kaworu Nagisa..." She mutters, "That was the closest I ever got to SEELE and their committee, helping to educate him. He was a sweet child, very bright and inquisitive. I always felt so sorry for him, he never had any friends or stimulation beyond what they set out for him."  
"渚薰..." 她喃喃道，"那是我最接近 SEELE 和他们委员会的一次，帮助教育他。他是个可爱的孩子，非常聪明且好奇。我总是为他感到难过，他从未有过任何朋友或刺激，除了他们为他安排的那些。"

"He did." I exclaim, "He... Kaworu, I... I know him, he is... my boyfriend. Can I... have a copy of this photo as well?"  
"他确实有。" 我惊呼，"他... 薰，我... 我认识他，他是... 我的男朋友。我能... 也拿一张这张照片吗？"

I look up and see Mari nod, "Of course! It seems there is a lot I don't know. I was so sure that he... well I knew what he was. I knew what SEELE had planned for him."  
我抬头看到真希波点头，"当然可以！看来有很多我不知道的事情。我曾那么确信他... 好吧，我知道他是什么。我知道 SEELE 对他有什么计划。"

I laugh, "Yeah... You have no idea. I don't really know where to begin."  
我笑着说，“是啊……你完全不知道。我真不知道该从何说起。”

"Well, I'm sure it can wait for another time." I pass her the book back, "I'm just glad he seems to have found a life for himself."  
“嗯，我相信可以等到下次再谈。”我把书递还给她，“我只是很高兴他似乎找到了自己的生活。”

I'm leaving Mari's home some half an hour or so after finding out that she knew Kaworu as well. We've exchanged phone numbers and e-mail addresses. I haven't filled her in on the full details of mine, Kaworu and Shinji's relationship but I will do so when I can.  
在得知玛丽也认识薰之后大约半小时，我离开了她的家。我们交换了电话号码和电子邮件地址。我还没有向她详细说明我和薰、真嗣之间的关系，但我会找机会告诉她的。

Truth be told I'm more than a little bit stunned by everything I have learned. I don't really know how to process it all, should I be happy about it all? Should I be upset or angry about any of this? I guess I can work all of that out at a later point, after I've spoken to Shinji and Kaworu. I'm sure they will be just as surprised as I am, especially Kaworu.  
说实话，我对所了解到的一切感到相当震惊。我真不知道该如何处理这一切，我应该为此感到高兴吗？还是应该对其中某些事情感到难过或愤怒？我想我可以稍后再解决这些问题，等我和真嗣、薰谈过之后。我相信他们也会和我一样惊讶，尤其是薰。

One thing I do feel with this is a sense of closure, like a huge chapter in my life is finally ending and I can move on with the next. I think this is the same for all of us, we're starting to accept who we were and what we are now and moving forward, and the best thing is, we get to do it all together.  
对此，我确实有一种结束感，就像我生命中的一个巨大篇章终于结束，我可以继续前进到下一章了。我想这对我们所有人来说都是一样的，我们开始接受过去的自己以及现在的自己，并向前迈进，而最好的事情是，我们可以一起完成这一切。

**End.**
