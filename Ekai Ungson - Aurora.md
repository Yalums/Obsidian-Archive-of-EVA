He loved the dawn, she known only as Aurora. But in that he thought her unreachable and lofty. He never knew that maybe even Aurora would have need for a mortal, for a goddess to have want of a mortal heart. An Asuka x Shinji piece.  
他钟情于黎明，那位仅以奥罗拉之名被知晓的女子。然而，在他心中，她如同遥不可及的高岭之花。他未曾想到，或许连奥罗拉也会渴望一个凡人的陪伴，一个女神也会向往凡人的心灵。这是一段明日香与真嗣的情感篇章。

The sun rises from her left shoulder, and he raises his eyes to the sky outside the enclosed spaces, astounded and awed, and utterly mesmerized with her silhouette against the light.  
太阳从她左肩升起，他抬头望向封闭空间外的天空，心中充满惊叹与敬畏，完全被她逆光中的身影所吸引。

He wonders vaguely of two things: why, when everything else of her was dark, her blue eyes remained blue, and how her eyes could be that color; infinitely, perpetually vivid. The clarity within them was astounding, something he could not fully comprehend—- how she could keep her eyes so clear when the whole world was crashing around them and everybody else's had clouded with purest despair.  
他心中隐约有两个疑问：为何在她的一切都黯淡无光时，唯独那双蓝眼睛依旧湛蓝；那双眼睛又是如何能如此永恒鲜明。它们所蕴含的清澈令人惊叹，他难以完全参透——当周遭世界分崩离析，众人眼中皆被绝望笼罩时，她却能保持双眸如此澄澈。

Her eyes, remained, unchanged.  
她的双眼依旧如初，未曾改变。

The stars hid behind her back and the darkness retreated to give way to light. She kept her eyes trailed on the horizon, to a realm far beyond the limits of man, and the beginnings of a somewhat poignant smile graced her features, still wishing of what was to come.  
星星隐匿在她身后，黑暗逐渐消退，为光明让路。她凝视着地平线，那里是人类视野之外的遥远世界，一抹略带忧伤的微笑在她脸上绽放，心中依旧怀揣着对未来的憧憬。

He wondered where she kept the stars during the day and how she sprinkled them over the sky at night. Surely, they shone for her, the way the world itself turned, for her, and suddenly he found himself wishing, wanting to be what they were—- the best that he could be, for her.  
他心中充满好奇，想知道她白天把星星藏在何处，夜晚又是如何将它们洒向天际。毫无疑问，星星为她而闪烁，世界也因她而旋转。这一刻，他突然渴望成为那些星星，只为她成为最好的自己。

She closed her eyes, and he closed his. He tried to be as silent as possible, and he heard from a distance the first sounds of a world waking—- wind on the trees, flapping of birds' wings, quiet voices speaking in tongues he could not understand, and the sound of her, breathing.  
她闭上双眼，他也随之闭目。他竭力保持静默，远处传来了世界苏醒的初声——风拂树梢，鸟翼轻拍，低语呢喃，言辞难解，而她的呼吸，清晰可闻。

Such strength within such infinite beauty was a cliché, but maybe not. Diamond in the rough, unpolished and stained, and brittle and without facets, but a diamond just the same, shone like one just the same. And hard, though weathered, though fractured, though broken.  
在无尽的美丽中蕴含如此力量，虽是老生常谈，却未必尽然。这颗未经打磨、带有瑕疵、脆弱且无刻面的钻石，依旧闪耀如初。尽管历经风雨、裂痕斑斑、支离破碎，它依然坚不可摧。

Where life was a tragedy, a chore, where they all could simply choose to stop breathing-- every intake of air she took was a reassurance, a testament to her desire to stay still alive. The mere fact that she took breath was clear proof of that.  
在那里，生活如同悲剧，充满艰辛，他们所有人都可以选择停止呼吸——然而，她每一次呼吸都成为一种慰藉，是她对生存渴望的明证。她能够呼吸，这一事实本身就充分证明了她的生存意志。

Fight. They did that, and then some, faced with creatures from origins unknown, staking lives and effort on the line to save a world that cared not the slightest bit for them. They faced fright and desperation countless times a day for something they did not truly understand. But fight, they do, and win, because no human, really, truly wants death, no matter how dire the circumstances. They knew because they were, in fact, humans who had hit rock bottom who still rose to battle.  
他们战斗，他们超越，面对着来自未知源头的生物，不惜以生命和努力为赌注，去拯救一个对他们漠不关心的世界。他们日复一日地无数次面对恐惧与绝望，为了一个他们并不完全理解的目标。但他们依然战斗，依然胜利，因为无论处境多么艰难，没有人真正渴望死亡。他们深知这一点，因为他们正是那些跌至人生谷底却仍能奋起抗争的人类。

He opened his eyes to find her rising from her perch. Fireflies followed at her wake, on the tips of her hair and her fingers. She extended her hands to the skies in tribute and the heavens returned her favor with the softest whisper of the wind on her hair, the slightest touch of it on her skin, and he burned from her flames, was scorched and consumed.  
他睁开双眼，只见她从栖息之地缓缓站起。萤火虫如影随形，点缀在她的发梢与指尖。她向苍穹伸出双臂，以示敬意，而天空亦以轻柔的微风回应，风儿轻抚她的秀发，轻触她的肌肤。他在她的火焰中燃烧，被灼伤，最终被吞噬。

He knew then that he would do anything for her.  
那时他明白，为了她他愿意付出一切。

In a world constantly moving, constantly turning, he could not stand still, could not remain sturdy. His weakness was his fragile humanity. But with burning words she threw him he found in himself a sort of strength, a sort of endurance. Only she had given him the knowledge that he could fight back at her because she was neither inferior nor superior. She was equal.  
在这个瞬息万变的世界中，他无法静止，无法保持坚定。他的脆弱源于他的人性。然而，她的激烈言辞激发了他内在的力量与耐力。正是她让他认识到，他可以反击，因为她既不低人一等，也不高人一等。她是平等的。

How could he stand with her and not be moved?  
他怎能与她并肩而立，内心却毫无波澜？

In a world that constantly left him behind, it was her who pushed him with heated hands to a pace where he could finally catch up. She stayed and she remained so that he could have someone to hold on to. Together, they met the falling sky and embraced it as their own.  
在这个世界不断让他感到落后的时候，是她用温暖的手推动他，让他终于能够跟上节奏。她选择留下，坚持不懈，只为让他有个依靠。他们共同面对那坠落的天空，将其视为自己的一部分，紧紧拥抱。

How could he stand with her and not be moved?  
他怎能与她并肩而立，内心却毫无波澜？

In a world where he was constantly lost, she was two things: light from her eyes was what guided him, taken him to a place far better than the world they were in. It was the clarity of those eyes that brought him the very meaning to his life. Also, her breath was the strength with which he kept walking. In a world that he would've given up on, she urged him on, however way she could. Scorched him and burned him and heated him.  
在这个他常常迷失的世界中，她代表着两样东西：她眼中的光芒引领着他，去往一个比他们所处的世界更加美好的地方。正是那双清澈的眼睛赋予了他生命的真谛。同时，她的呼吸成为他不断前行的力量。在一个他可能早已放弃的世界里，她竭尽所能地激励他继续前进，如同烈火般炙热、燃烧、温暖。

How could he stand with her and not be moved?  
他怎能与她并肩而立，内心却毫无波澜？

And finally, in a world that generally did not care, generally left him to his own machinations of doing and undoing, she needed him. Before pouring rain and dark skies she had pressed her head to his chest and the most profound of emotions ran through him, scorched his heart and burned his soul.  
最终，在这个大多数人漠不关心、任由他自作主张的世界里，她需要他。在暴雨和阴云密布的天空下，她将头紧贴在他的胸膛，一股深沉的情感涌入他的心扉，炙热地燃烧着他的心灵和灵魂。

She lent him direction. WAS his direction.  
她指引了他。曾是他的指引。

And he stood, and he moved.  
他站立不动，随后缓缓移动。

He wanted to be worthy of what she was—- worthy to protect her strength, worthy to keep her beauty. He wanted to be worthy of her happiness, worthy of her smile, worthy of her need.  
他渴望能与她相匹配——能够保护她的坚强，能够守护她的美丽。他渴望能与她的幸福相称，能与她的笑容相映，能满足她的需求。

He wanted to be the one she clung to.  
他渴望成为她依赖的那个人。

Her flame-red hair burns, light on the edges and tips. From where he sat, she bore resemblance to an angel-- not those they fought today, but an angel from tales he imagined his mother told him, before she died.  
她那如火焰般鲜红的头发闪耀着光芒，边缘与发梢尤为明亮。在他所坐之处望去，她宛如一位天使——并非今日他们所对抗的那些，而是他记忆中母亲曾讲述的童话故事里的天使，那是在母亲离世之前。

When she looked so serene and peaceful the way she did today, he could believe that he had the strength to keep her that way, he could believe that he could do anything and everything for her.  
当她今天显得如此宁静安详时，他相信自己有能力让她一直这样，他相信自己可以为她付出一切。

The skies are red three times a day—- sunset, midnight and now, at dawn. Where the heavens were not yet full blue, but scattered with splashes of crimson. Red as her flaming hair, red and boundless and brave, like her, as she laid command over the horizon.  
天空一天三次呈现红色——日落、午夜和黎明时分。天际尚未完全转为蓝色，而是散布着点点猩红。这红色如同她那炽烈的头发，无边无际，勇敢无畏，正如她掌控着地平线的姿态。

The sky, now, was a mixture of red, yellow, and purple-gray. She straightens.  
此刻的天空，红、黄、紫灰交织，色彩斑斓。她挺直了身子。

"Come on, we'll be late, _dummkopf._"  
快点，我们要迟到了，傻瓜。

In a sudden burst of rare courage, he grabbed her hand as she walked past, before she could walk away. She turned, pinpricks of light in her flame hair, startled.  
突然间，他鼓起罕见的勇气，在她走过时一把抓住了她的手，不让她离开。她惊讶地转过身，火焰般的头发中闪烁着点点光芒。

I love you' were words too used, too worn out for the rest of the world, words he did not yet deserve to say to her. But he had to say something--- somehow---  
“我爱你”这句话已被用得太多，对世界而言已显得陈旧，他还不配对她说出口。但他必须说些什么——以某种方式——

"I--- need you, Asuka."  
我需要你，明日香。

She blinked once and the world stopped turning. Slowly, she regained her balance.  
她轻轻眨眼间，世界仿佛静止了。渐渐地，她重新找回了平衡。

"You're hallucinating." 你产生了幻觉。

But he saw the traces of a smile on her lips and saw, also, that this time today, the sun had risen in her eyes of sky.  
然而，他注意到她唇边残留的微笑，并发现今天此刻，她的眼中仿佛升起了朝阳。

Daybreak's name was Sohryu Asuka-Langley.  
曙的名字是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

He was resolved. 他已下定决心。

-Owari.

### Comment
[jennyjennai](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/359113/jennyjennai): Poetic, beautifully written. The imagery of the story was so lovely, almost esoteric in its recital - but beautiful all the same.  
诗意盎然，文笔优美。故事中的意象如此动人，近乎神秘的叙述中却蕴含着美。

[Kay D. Chan](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/59192/Kay-D-Chan): This was beautiful. It was deep love-not quick fluff, descriptive, poetic, and so like our idealistic sentimental Shinji. I enjoyed how you wrote it. It was just so ROMANTIC and *deep*. I'm tempted to throw a "Yo" or a "Dude" in this to lighten things but I wouldn't change your fanfic for the world. It just seems like you really put a lot of heart and sincerety in writing this. Great job.  
这真是太美了。这是深沉的爱——不是短暂的轻浮，而是充满描述性、诗意的，非常符合我们理想化的感性真嗣。我很喜欢你的写作方式。真是太浪漫了，而且非常深刻。我有点想在这里加个“哟”或“兄弟”来轻松一下，但我绝不会为了世界改变你的同人文。感觉你真的投入了很多心血和真诚来写这篇。干得漂亮。

[Amata](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/29755/Amata): Wow, this is, quite simply, the best story i've read in a long time. it's so hard to find such a simple yet profound love story.  No cliches...congratulations...it's so hard not to sometimes.  It's wonderful, keep writing...  
哇，这真是我很久以来读过的最好的故事。如此简单却又深刻的爱情故事，实在难得一见。没有陈词滥调...恭喜...有时候真的很难避免。太棒了，继续写下去...

[SuPeRnOvA145](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/210436/SuPeRnOvA145): VERY GOOD! You can use big words to make good descriptions. Now, you just need to have a good storyline, IC characters, and some action and i'll consider this a real fic. Your description is... abundant, but everything else is lacking. Continue on, and go easy on the descriptions. We look for a story of substance, not a loose description of a colorful visual.  
非常棒！你能用大词来做出精彩的描述。现在，你只需要有一个好的故事线，角色形象鲜明，再加上一些动作情节，我就会认为这是一篇真正的同人文。你的描述很丰富，但其他方面还有所欠缺。继续努力，描述方面可以稍微简化一些。我们追求的是有内涵的故事，而不是对绚丽画面的松散描述。

Reizig: If this takes place anywhere in the regular series, then I can't see Shinji adoring Asuka so openingly, or at all. However, taken out of context, it's great. Beautifully written to the point where I almost don't care whether or not the romanticism makes sense.  Jolly good show. 
如果这发生在正剧中的任何地方，那么我无法想象真嗣会如此公开地，甚至是任何程度地崇拜明日香。然而，脱离了上下文，这作品非常出色。写得如此之美，以至于我几乎不在乎这种浪漫主义是否合理。真是精彩绝伦。
  
[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): Cute, though vague as most of this type of one shot seem to be the norm. But still a slice of a moment of the series and a chance at hope though fleeting.  
虽然这类短篇大多显得模糊，但这个故事还是挺可爱的。但即便如此，这一刻仍是系列中的一瞬，尽管转瞬即逝，却也带来了希望的契机。
