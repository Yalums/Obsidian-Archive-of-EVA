## Chapter 1 Asuka on the Shore

前言：怀着忐忑不安的心情和糟糕的语法，我在此向毫无防备的世界发布我的新小说。虽然我享受写作的过程，但对它的接受程度还是有些紧张。原本打算作为一章的序言，不知不觉扩展成了四章。感觉需要足够的空间来把握事物，然后才进入故事的主体部分，我不想发布一个长达数万字的第一章。

无论如何……我的不安全感就说到这里……请享受吧！

Chapter One. 第一章。

Asuka on the Shore 岸边的明日香

The Dead Moon wore the bloody slash across its face like some kind of grotesque leer. The extremis of its sister, the Blue Earth, had permanently marked the celestial orb in the violence of its death throes.

死亡之月将那道血腥的裂痕横亘于面庞，宛如某种怪诞的狞笑。其姊妹蓝地球的极端状态，在垂死挣扎中永久地在这颗天体上留下了印记。

Now that crimson stream had retreated from the moon and hung lazily in low orbit around the stricken planet. The fabric of the arc gibbered and chattered incontinently, but no spark of true intellect animated the billions of souls that had been mashed so brutally into it. Neither Destrudo nor Libido swirled within its blood stained depths.

如今，那道猩红的流光已从月球退去，懒洋洋地悬挂在受创星球低矮的轨道上。弧形结构的织物无节制地颤动着，但亿万被如此残酷地碾碎的灵魂中，并无一丝真正的智慧火花。在其血迹斑斑的深处，既无破坏欲也无生命力涌动。

From that altitude no sign of the life form that had so heedlessly wounded its host could be made out. But, coming in closer to the blighted surface a small figure could be seen picking its way gingerly through the rubble of a ruined city.

从那个高度无法辨认出曾如此鲁莽伤害其宿主的生命形态。然而，当接近这片荒芜的表面时，可以看到一个小小的身影小心翼翼地穿行在废墟之城中。

"Fuck!" Asuka said angrily as the pain of a sharp concrete fragment jabbed into her knee as she stumbled and fell on the rock-strewn roadway. "Just fucking brilliant!" She muttered as she staggered and fell yet again

"操！" 明日香愤怒地说道，因为一块尖锐的混凝土碎片刺入了她的膝盖，她在布满石块的路面上绊倒摔倒了。"真他妈棒极了！" 她嘟囔着，再次踉跄跌倒。

The bright red suit had been a marvel of 21st Century science. A non-permeable synthetic memory fabric that allowed maximum efficiency and enhanced synchronicity with the core of a gigantic bio-engineered robot and also had several life support functions built into a fully articulated and lightweight Plug Suit.

那件鲜红色的套装是 21 世纪科学的奇迹。一种不透水的合成记忆面料，不仅允许最大效率，还增强了与巨型生物工程机器人核心的同步性，同时集成了多项生命维持功能，是一款全关节轻量化插件套装。

Sadly, as Asuka was discovering, it was almost useless for an extended hike into a ruined battle zone. Especially as the soles of her feet were only protected by a paper thin layer of synthetic rubber that offered no protection at all from sharp stones and rubble.

遗憾的是，正如明日香所发现的那样，这套装备对于深入废墟战区的长途徒步几乎毫无用处。尤其是她的脚底仅有一层薄如纸的合成橡胶保护，根本无法抵御尖锐的石块和瓦砾。

"Stupid fucking suit." She said bitterly as she wearily got back up onto her feet. She raised a bandaged arm to her knotted red hair and tried to push it away from her face. The hair, caked as it was with now dry LCL, refused to budge and remained irritatingly hanging in front of her good eye.

"该死的破衣服。" 她愤愤地说着，疲惫地重新站起身来。她抬起缠着绷带的手臂，试图将打结的红发从脸前拨开。然而，头发因干涸的 LCL 而粘结，纹丝不动，依旧恼人地垂在她那只好眼前。

Now that was a worry. Never mind how she had ended up on that beach alive but heavily bandaged when her last definite living memory was being torn to screaming shreds by the Mass Production Evangelions. She shook her head. Just how she was now alive to wander this shattered city was a question that she refused to address just yet.

那确实令人担忧。不必在意她是如何在那个海滩上，尽管浑身缠满绷带却依然活着，而她最后的明确生存记忆是被量产型福音战士撕扯成尖叫的碎片。她摇了摇头。她现在如何能活着在这座破碎的城市中徘徊，这个问题她暂时拒绝去深究。

What did worry her more than she would allow herself to admit was what lay beneath those bandages. Her right arm was swathed from knuckle to shoulder in them, as was much of her torso. What really scared her was that her left eye had been covered with a thick gauze pad and yet more bandages around her head held it in place. She knew, how could she possibly have forgotten, that these were the exact same injuries that she had received in that final battle with the MP Evas. She touched the pad over her eye gingerly, wincing at the pain that lanced into her skull just with that mere contact.

真正让她难以启齿的担忧，是那些绷带下的秘密。她的右臂从指节到肩膀被绷带紧紧包裹，大部分躯干亦是如此。真正令她恐惧的是，她的左眼被厚厚的纱布垫覆盖，头部的更多绷带将其固定。她清楚地记得，又怎能忘记，这些正是她在与 MP 使徒的最终决战中遭受的相同伤害。她小心翼翼地触摸着眼上的垫子，仅仅这一接触便感到剧痛直刺颅内，不禁皱眉。

She shook her head to clear her anxiety, there would be plenty of time for freaking out later. Now more important matters occupied her.

她摇了摇头，试图驱散心中的焦虑，以后有的是时间去恐慌。现在有更重要的事情占据着她的思绪。

She picked her way towards the former centre of Tokyo-3. None of the buildings in this area had escaped the devastation of the multiple N2 mines that the JSSDF had deployed against the fortress city during the battle. Here and there one stood defiantly amidst the ruins, but even those had a mortally wounded look to them. As if they would crumble at the merest vibration or noise. Asuka decided that she could not risk exploring them just yet.

她小心翼翼地向曾经的东京-3 中心区域走去。这片地区的建筑无一幸免于多次 N2 地雷的破坏，这些地雷是日本自卫队在战斗中针对这座堡垒城市部署的。这里那里，有些建筑在废墟中顽强地屹立着，但即便如此，它们也显得奄奄一息，仿佛只要最轻微的震动或声响就会崩塌。明日香决定目前还不能冒险去探索它们。

Behind her, the Sun began to rise in the East, giving the whole area a slightly lurid bloody cast. Not that it needed it. She thought grimly. It was gruesome enough already.

在她身后，太阳开始从东方升起，给整个区域染上了一层略显血腥的色彩。其实这并不需要，她冷酷地想。这里已经足够恐怖了。

"Red sky at Morning, Shepherd take Warning." The old rhyme tolled randomly in her head. She ignored it and trudged her sense of direction was serving her correctly, the nearest access point to the Geo-Front should be coming up soon. Just past a pile of burnt out car bodies and an upside down Armoured Personnel Carrier she saw a sign attached to a fallen telephone pole pointing to Emergency Shelter H-74. Her pulse quickened and her feet picked up their pace. Just beyond that shelter should be one of the main access routes down to Central Dogma.

"清晨红霞，牧羊人警觉。"这古老的韵谣在她脑海中随意响起。她不予理会，坚信自己的方向感无误，通往地底都市的最近入口应即将出现。越过一堆烧毁的汽车残骸和一辆翻覆的装甲运兵车后，她看到一根倒下的电线杆上挂着指向紧急避难所 H-74 的指示牌。心跳加速，脚步也随之加快。那避难所后方，便是通往中央教条区的主要下行通道之一。

She squeezed herself past the burnt shell of the APC. "Shit." The collapsed remains of two buildings blocked her view of the entrance, but she still knew that she was in the right place. Ignoring the pain in her feet as she climbed the small hill of rubble she clambered her way up to the top of it, feeling sure that she would see some sign of NERV or the Geofront on the other side.

她挤过那辆被烧毁的装甲运兵车残骸，“该死。”两座倒塌的建筑物残骸挡住了她对入口的视线，但她仍然确信自己来对了地方。不顾脚上的疼痛，她攀上那堆碎石小山，奋力爬到顶端，坚信在另一侧定能看到 NERV 或地下都市的迹象。

She got far more than she bargained for. Asuka fell to her knees. For a moment not even noticing the pain as the rubble cut through her plug suit and opened up fresh wounds in her lower legs.

她得到的远超预期。明日香跪倒在地，一时间甚至未察觉到疼痛，瓦砾划破了她的插入栓服，在她的小腿上留下了新的伤口。

An enormous crater yawned out in front of her as she crested the hill. At least two kilometres across and perhaps five hundred metres or more deep. No hope of access to the facilities contained below was remotely possible. She scrambled down the other side of the rubble and gingerly crawled as close to the edge as she dared and peered down into the remains of the Geofront.

当她登上山丘时，眼前豁然出现一个巨大的坑洞。直径至少两公里，深度或许超过五百米。想要接近下方设施的希望渺茫至极。她从碎石的另一侧艰难爬下，小心翼翼地匍匐前进，尽可能靠近边缘，探头窥视着 Geofront 的遗迹。

Even in the pale early dawn light it was clear that the vast Geofront was dead. It wasn't just the grey lifeless wasteland that was the true indicator. Nor was it the ruin brought by the final battle, Her final battle, against the forces of SEELE and the JSSDF.

即使在苍白的黎明曙光中，也能清晰地看出广阔的 Geofront 已是一片死寂。这不仅仅是因为那片灰暗无生机的荒地，也非最终战役——她与 SEELE 及日本自卫队（JSSDF）势力对决的遗迹——所造成的废墟。

No. The Geofront, with its smashed pyramid and battered warships lying bleakly in the dead landscape wasn't what really told the story of the final battle of Humanity. It was the smell. A rotten, but sickly sweet organic stench that convulsed her stomach and scarred her brain. Nothing meaningful was left alive down there, nothing could be, she just knew it.

不，真正讲述人类最终战役故事的，并非那片死寂景象中破碎的金字塔和残破战舰，而是那股气味——腐烂却令人作呕的甜腻有机恶臭，它令她胃部痉挛，脑海留下烙印。她深知，那里已无任何有意义的生命存留，也不可能有。

Asuka's stomach convulsed and she retched and spat out some foul tasting bile into the chasm before inching away from the edge and back into the ruins of Tokyo-3. It seemed a fitting farewell to that place which had brought nothing but pain and ruin to her life.

明日香的胃一阵痉挛，她干呕着，吐出了一些恶心的胆汁，落入眼前的深渊。她缓缓地从边缘退回，重新进入东京-3 的废墟。这似乎是对那个只给她带来痛苦和毁灭的地方的恰当告别。

The sun had finally risen on this first morning of the World. But it brought no warmth with it. Third Impact, it seemed, had wrought yet another cataclysmic shift in the Planet's balance as the perpetual summer of the Second Impact was finally brought to its end. Dark clouds gathered over the mountains and Asuka hugged her arms to her body in a vain attempt to ward off the deep chill in the air.

世界的第一天早晨，太阳终于升起，却未带来丝毫温暖。第三次冲击似乎再次引发了地球平衡的灾难性转变，第二次冲击带来的永恒夏日终于宣告结束。乌云聚集在山脉之上，明日香紧紧抱住双臂，徒劳地试图抵御空气中刺骨的寒意。

She was so tired. 她累极了。

Following the trail of the nearby railway tracks she set off for her next destination. Home. Maybe, just maybe, she would find something there that they could use to help them survive. Who knew? Maybe the old apartment building would still be standing. Squashing down the voice in her head that told her it was hopeless she limped and staggered along the tracks. The train tracks appeared to be the one clear pathway within the ruined city. With the state of emergency and the JSSDF attacks near the End, there were no trains, or train wrecks along the way, and the noise barriers had been reasonably effective at stopping the debris from blocking the track ways. Maybe things were looking up after all? Maybe the part of town that they lived in had been spared the carnage.

沿着附近的铁路轨道，她踏上了前往下一个目的地的旅程——家。或许，只是或许，她能在那里找到一些能帮助他们生存的东西。谁知道呢？也许那座老旧的公寓楼依旧屹立不倒。她压抑着内心告诉她一切无望的声音，一瘸一拐地沿着铁轨蹒跚前行。铁轨似乎是这座废墟城市中唯一清晰的路径。由于紧急状态和日本自卫队接近尾声的攻击，沿途没有火车，也没有火车残骸，噪音屏障在阻止碎片堵塞轨道方面相当有效。或许情况终究在好转？也许他们居住的那片城区幸免于难。

Maybe even that stupid penguin was still there...

或许那只笨笨的企鹅还在那里……

It took her the best part of an hour for her to reach the old apartment. She had ground her way along, ignoring the increasing chill of the air and the now icy wind that funnelled down the tracks in her hope that she would find something of her old life at the end. If the apartment was still there, then maybe they stood a chance of making it, maybe...

她花了将近一个小时才到达那间旧公寓。她一路坚持前行，不顾空气中愈发刺骨的寒意和沿着轨道呼啸而来的凛冽寒风，心中怀揣着希望，期盼在终点能找到旧日生活的痕迹。如果公寓还在，或许他们还有机会挺过去，或许……

The death of that hope almost robbed Asuka of the will to go on.

那份希望的破灭几乎夺走了明日香继续前行的意志。

The Apartment building had pancaked floor upon floor before cracking on the bones of the liftwell and collapsing outward onto the road in front of her. A small sob escaped her and a stray tear cut a clean path down her cheek.

公寓楼在电梯井的骨架上层层叠叠地坍塌，随后向外倾覆，倒在了她面前的马路上。她不禁发出一声轻泣，一滴泪水沿着脸颊划出一条清晰的痕迹。

Amongst the rubble closest to her a small glint of metal caught her eye in the shadows. Curiosity got the better of her and she went to the pile of broken masonry and crouched down to look inside. Amongst the twisted rebar and concrete shards a small battered golden cylinder lay catching what dull light the cloudy sky offered. Asuka reached down and took hold of it, turning it over in her hand. A small quiver trembled across her lips as she looked at the picture of the strange little man with the fish on the can. The brand name 'YEBISU, ALL MALT BEER' was still legible on the front.

在离她最近的瓦砾堆中，一抹金属的微光在阴影里吸引了她的目光。好奇心驱使她走向那堆破碎的砖石，蹲下身来探查。在扭曲的钢筋和混凝土碎片之间，躺着一个破旧的金色小圆筒，它捕捉着阴沉天空中微弱的光线。明日香伸手拾起它，在手中翻转。当她看到罐上那个带着鱼图案的奇怪小人时，嘴角不由自主地微微颤抖。罐前的品牌名“惠比寿，全麦啤酒”依然清晰可辨。

A prickling sensation was beginning in her uncovered eye as moisture formed unbidden in it and trickled slowly down her grimy cheek. A jumble of memories assailed her. Her guardian's morning yell of beer charged joy, Misato smiling at her across the table of that stupid Ramen stand after the 10th Angel… Somehow, through the hazy chaos of images that she knew must have come from Instrumentality she saw the woman lying by the NERV lift well with her lifeblood draining from her body.

她的裸露眼睛开始感到刺痛，泪水不由自主地涌出，缓缓滑过她沾满尘土的脸颊。一连串的记忆向她袭来：她的监护人早晨充满啤酒喜悦的吼叫，第十个使徒之后，在那个愚蠢的拉面摊上，美里隔着桌子对她微笑……不知怎的，在那些她知道必定来自人类补完计划的模糊混乱画面中，她看到了那个女人躺在 NERV 电梯井旁，生命之血正从她体内流失。

Asuka wiped her bandaged hand across her eye, smearing the dirt and dried LCL over her cheek. The old familiar fire of anger building up in her chest. She cocked her good arm and threw the beer can angrily in the ruins of her former home, the can rupturing and spraying its contents into the air briefly before disappearing down amongst the rubble.

明日香用她那缠着绷带的手擦过眼睛，将泥土和干涸的 LCL 抹在脸颊上。胸中那股熟悉的怒火再次燃起。她挥动着完好的手臂，愤怒地将啤酒罐扔向她曾经的家的废墟中，罐子破裂，里面的液体短暂地喷洒到空中，随后便消失在瓦砾之下。

"God-damn it!" She yelled at the ruins. "What the fuck is this? Is this what we fought for? Is this what Misato died for? What Kaji died for? What the FUCK did you stupid old men do to my fucking World, you fucking bastards?" She screamed as she threw a rock back into the buildings skeleton in impotent fury. As she did a sharp pain tore across her body, doubling the girl over and causing her to stumble and collapse back onto her bloodied knees.

"该死的！"她对着废墟怒吼，"这他妈是什么？这就是我们为之战斗的吗？这就是为了美里而死的吗？为了加持而死的吗？你们这些愚蠢的老家伙到底对我的世界做了什么，你们这些混蛋！"她尖叫着，将一块石头狠狠扔回建筑的骨架，无力的愤怒中。就在这时，一阵剧痛撕裂她的身体，使她弯腰驼背，踉跄着倒下，再次跪在血迹斑斑的膝盖上。

"Fu-Fuck..." She spat out between rasping breaths as her body felt like it was on fire from a dozen or more separate points of pain. Each one a searing reminder of the MP Evangelions and her defeat and living disembowelment at their hands.

"妈的……" 她喘着粗气吐出这个词，身体仿佛被十几处甚至更多的疼痛点点燃，每一处都像是在炽烈地提醒她，那些 MP 福音战士带给她的失败和活生生被剖腹的痛苦。

Eventually the pain subsided to more bearable levels but the girl's breaths still hitched and gasped as she buried her head in her hands and gave in to the despair that had threatened to engulf her since she had woken on the beach what could have been hours, years or a lifetime ago.

最终，疼痛减轻到了可以忍受的程度，但女孩的呼吸依旧断断续续，她将头埋在双手中，任由自她从海滩上醒来那一刻起就威胁着要将她吞没的绝望感占据心头，那可能是几小时、几年，甚至是一生之前的事了。

More time passed. 时间又过去了。

Eventually the ever deepening chill in the air brought her back to herself and she painfully got back up onto her feet. "Get a grip, Soryu." She muttered to herself. Self pity was for the weak. It was for fools like Shinji, Misato or Dr Akagi. Not for her. She was better than that. Better than them.

最终，空气中愈发深沉的寒意将她拉回现实，她痛苦地重新站起身来。“振作点，Soryu。”她自言自语道。自怜是弱者的行为，是像真嗣、美里或赤木博士那样的愚者所为，而不是她。她比那更优秀，比他们更出色。

Keep moving, that was the key to survival. She'd show them that she couldn't be broken.

不断前行，这是生存的关键。她要向他们证明，自己不会被击垮。

Slowly, but more purposefully, she turned her back on her old home, her old life, and hobbled away from the ruins of Tokyo-3 and back to the beach from which she had come. Who knew, maybe the idiot would still be there.

她缓缓地，却更加坚定地转身离开了旧居，告别了过去的生活，一瘸一拐地从东京-3 的废墟中离开，回到了她曾来的那片海滩。谁知道呢，或许那个傻瓜还在那里。

Her first concrete memory after all of… whatever the fuck that whole Instrumentality thing was… had been of him on top of her, squeezing her throat painfully. Her lungs had screamed for air, her instincts yelled at her to fight back, but she couldn't. She had seen his pain. He had been at the heart of it all. Third Impact, Instrumentality, whatever the fuck they called it. All of the hurt he had suffered at his Father's hands, and at her hands as well, she had seen it all. She couldn't lash out at him after seeing that. He had chosen to make this new World and if he had also chosen to eradicate her presence from it she would have welcomed the release.

在那一切……无论那整个所谓的“人类补完计划”究竟是什么鬼东西之后，她的第一个清晰记忆，是他压在她身上，痛苦地掐住她的喉咙。她的肺部渴望空气，本能驱使她反抗，但她做不到。她看到了他的痛苦。他正是这一切的中心。第三次冲击，人类补完，随便他们怎么称呼。他所承受的所有伤害，无论是来自他父亲的，还是来自她的，她都看在眼里。在目睹了这一切后，她无法对他反击。如果他选择创造这个新世界，并且也决定将她的存在从这个世界上抹去，她会欣然接受这份解脱。

She shuddered to think of how accepting of giving in to oblivion she had been right at that moment.

她一想到那一刻自己竟如此轻易地接受了沉入遗忘，就不寒而栗。

She had lifted her bandaged hand to gently stroke his cheek. That had been what had broken him it seemed. His grip on her neck had loosened and he had collapsed on top of her wracked by great sobs and hot tears that splashed onto her upturned face. She had closed her eye and let her hand fall back to her side as she lay there beneath him.

她抬起缠着绷带的手，轻抚他的脸颊。似乎正是这一举动击溃了他。他紧扼她脖子的手松开了，整个人瘫倒在她身上，伴随着剧烈的抽泣和滚烫的泪水，溅落在她仰起的脸上。她闭上眼睛，任由手垂回身侧，静静躺在他的身下。

She remembered that she had felt completely disgusting.

她记得自己当时感到极度厌恶。

Sometime later she had drifted back to consciousness with a sense of a great loss that had somehow befallen her. She opened her eye. The blackness of the firmament against the full moon and the red smear across the sky greeted her. She could no longer see Shinji.

不久后，她渐渐恢复了意识，心中涌起一种莫大的失落感，仿佛有什么不幸降临到了她身上。她睁开眼睛，只见漆黑的天幕映衬着满月，天际一道红色的痕迹向她致意。她再也看不到真嗣了。

Strangely it was that realisation that had filled her with the sense of loss.

奇怪的是，正是这种认识让她充满了失落感。

She had lain there, staring upwards as the sound of the waves of… whatever that stuff was… lapped against the shoreline. The Universe had stood still for those moments, holding its breath it seemed for what would come after the trauma of Third Impact.

她躺在那里，仰望着天空，听着那不知何物的波浪拍打着岸边。在那几刻，宇宙仿佛静止了，似乎屏息等待着第三次冲击的创伤之后将会发生什么。

Gently, as if she was unsure if they would actually work, she levered herself up on her arms and awkwardly rolled into a kneeling position. There he was. Sitting about three metres away from where she was lying was Shinji. His back was to her and he seemed to just be staring out across the red sea in front of him at the huge and shattered visage of the being formerly known as Wondergirl that lay far out to sea.

她小心翼翼地用双臂撑起身体，仿佛不确定它们是否真的能支撑自己，然后笨拙地翻滚成跪姿。他就坐在那里，距离她躺着的地方大约三米远，背对着她。真嗣似乎正凝视着面前这片红色海洋，远处的海面上躺着曾经被称为奇迹少女的巨大而破碎的面容。

"Shinji." She said. Her voice coming out as a hoarse croak.

"真嗣。" 她说道，声音沙哑得像是呱呱声。

He didn't move. 他没有动。

"Oi… Baka Shinji!" She said more forcefully, the effort hurting her parched throat.

"喂…笨蛋真嗣！" 她更加用力地说道，干涩的喉咙因此感到疼痛。

Still no reaction. 仍然没有反应。

Groaning in annoyance she crawled across the sand to where he sat and looked into his pale face. His eyes were empty pools of darkness, the blue irises unfocussed and slack. She held out her good hand to his cheek.

她不耐烦地呻吟着，爬过沙地来到他坐着的地方，凝视着他苍白的面庞。他的眼睛像是空洞的黑暗池塘，蓝色的虹膜失焦而松弛。她伸出那只好手，轻触他的脸颊。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

Not even a flicker of recognition.

连一丝认出的迹象都没有。

"Come on Baka, snap out of it!" She said tapping him reasonably gently on the cheek.

"喂，笨蛋，醒醒！" 她边说边适度轻柔地拍了拍他的脸颊。

The sound of the waves was her only answer. She was getting angry now. She shook him roughly by his shoulders, his head swaying back and forth like a doll. 'Like a fucking doll!'

海浪声是她唯一的回应。她现在越来越生气了。她用力摇晃着他的肩膀，他的头像玩偶一样前后摆动。'就像个该死的玩偶！'

"For fuck's sake Third! Get your fucking head out of your ass and look at me! Arrgh!"

该死的第三！把你那该死的脑袋从屁股里拔出来，看着我！啊！

She herself then hunched over as the pain from her injuries, still concealed by their bandages, lanced through her body and head. Asuka doubled over in agony on the sand in front of Shinji, cradling her head in her hands.

随后，她因伤痛而蜷缩起来，尽管伤口仍被绷带遮掩，但剧痛如利刃般穿透她的身体和头部。在真嗣面前，明日香痛苦地弯下腰，双手抱头，倒在沙滩上。

"S-Shit…" She gasped as she waited for the pain to subside.

"该死…"她喘息着等待疼痛缓解。

Asuka finally struggled up to her feet, looking down on the unresponsive Third Child.

明日香终于挣扎着站起身来，俯视着毫无反应的第三适格者。

"Fine, idiot! Stay here if you want. Wallow in your pathetic self pity! I don't care!" She kicked him where he sat and stumbled away from him. "Fuck you Third Child!"

好啊，蠢货！想留就留吧。沉浸在你那可悲的自怜中吧！我不在乎！她朝他坐着的地方踢了一脚，踉跄着离开了他。“去你的，第三适格者！”

As she staggered up the beach she passed a lone piece of driftwood that had obviously been deliberately shoved vertically into the sand further up the shore. On a rusted nail near the top of the stake hung a very familiar plain silver Greek cross hanging on a thin leather necklace. It was the cross that Misato always wore. She looked more closely at the cross. Several small patches of dark red had been splashed across it and then dried out. They were unmistakeably dried blood.

她踉跄着走上沙滩，经过一根显然是故意垂直插入沙中更靠岸边的漂流木。在木桩顶端附近的一枚锈钉上，挂着一条熟悉的朴素银色希腊十字架，它悬挂在一条细皮项链上。那是美里一直佩戴的十字架。她更仔细地观察十字架，上面有几小块深红色斑点，已经干涸。那无疑是干了的血迹。

The image of Misato's face, pale and drawn with blood coming from the corners of her mouth, flashed up in her mind. She knew that her guardian had died a violent and heroic death, Instrumentality had made sure that she wasn't spared the slightest detail, but seeing this memorial; This Grave Marker made it all too present and real. She turned away from the driftwood shrine and limped away from all it represented and back to what she had hoped was civilisation and medical care.

脑海中浮现出美里苍白憔悴的面容，嘴角淌着血。她知道自己的守护者以一种惨烈而英勇的方式牺牲了，人类补完计划确保她无法忽略任何细节。但看到这个纪念碑，这个墓标，一切变得如此真实而近在咫尺。她转身离开那由浮木搭建的神龛，一瘸一拐地远离了它所代表的一切，回到她所希望的文明与医疗救助之中。

Sometime later, before she had reached the ruins of Tokyo-3, she realised that Shinji must have put that piece of driftwood up as his own personal memorial to his loss. That realisation hurt her. He had thought enough beyond himself to make a symbolic statement of loss and memory in his time here whereas she all she had achieved thus far was to yell at him and kick him in the hip.

不久之后，在她抵达东京-3 的废墟之前，她意识到那块浮木一定是真嗣为了纪念他的失去而亲手竖立的个人纪念碑。这一认识让她心痛。他在这里的时候，已经超越了自我，用象征性的方式表达了对失去和记忆的哀悼，而她迄今为止所做的，不过是冲他大吼和踢他的臀部。

"Damn bony hip too." She said to herself with a grimace. Her toes still throbbed painfully on her right foot from the contact. She decided that after she had explored, and maybe found some help, she would go back to him and maybe even apologise for her earlier roughness.

"该死的骨头突出的髋部。" 她皱着眉头自言自语。她的右脚趾因接触而仍然疼痛地跳动着。她决定，在探索一番，或许找到一些帮助之后，她会回去找他，甚至可能为之前的粗鲁道歉。

Maybe. 或许。

"Well, he did try to strangle me!" She muttered to herself as she headed off in what she instinctively felt was the direction of Tokyo-3. The city that had been her home for the past year.

"唉，他确实试图掐死我！" 她一边自言自语，一边朝着直觉告诉她的东京第三区的方向走去。那个城市，过去一年曾是她的家。

xxxx

The city that she knew for sure was now completely dead.

她确信，这座城市如今已彻底荒废。

In the time that it took her to get back from Tokyo-3 to the Sea Shore she needed to figure out what the next move that she would have to make would be. It took but a little of her impressive intellect to figure out that shelter from the increasingly bitter wind and some kind of food were going to be high in her list of priorities. 'Thank you Mr State-the-fucking-obvious Maslow!' She thought bitterly.

在她从东京-3 返回海滨的这段时间里，她需要想清楚下一步必须采取的行动。凭借她那惊人的才智，她很快意识到，躲避愈发刺骨的寒风和寻找食物将是她优先考虑的事项。“感谢你，说废话的马斯洛先生！”她苦涩地想。

Heading back as she was from where the ruins of their old apartment lay, she passed through more open country than she had on the way to the city. This had obviously been productive farmland once, though now the land looked wounded and over grown with weeds and ruin.

当她从旧公寓的废墟返回时，她穿过的开阔乡村地带比前往城市时更多。这里显然曾是一片肥沃的农田，然而如今土地显得伤痕累累，杂草丛生，一片荒凉。

For the first time that day she actually wondered, 'Just how long has it been since anyone actually lived here?'

那天她第一次真正好奇起来：“到底有多久没人在这里住过了？”

Everything around her looked like it had been abandoned for what could be months or even years. What on Earth had actually happened here? How long had she been gone for?

她周围的一切看起来都像是被遗弃了数月甚至数年。这里究竟发生了什么？她离开了多久？

'Can't answer that right now' She thought as she limped onward. She had more important things to worry about. With that in mind she paid closer attention to her surroundings than she had on the way out.

她一瘸一拐地继续前行，心想：“现在无法回答那个问题。”她有更重要的事情需要担心。因此，她比出门时更加留心周围的环境。

Eventually she spotted something that looked promising. Off to the side of the dirt track she had been walking along, a couple of hundred metres or so from where she stood, a small cluster of buildings sat huddled together amongst the overgrown fields.

最终，她发现了一处看似有希望的地方。在她一直行走的土路旁，距离她站立之处约几百米的地方，一小簇建筑群蜷缩在杂草丛生的田野间。

She could feel her pulse quicken. A farmhouse! That was exactly what she needed. It was far enough away from the City so that damage should have been minimal, and she knew that farms tended to be more self sufficient than town or city houses, so it offered them the best chance of survival.

她能感觉到自己的脉搏加速。一座农舍！这正是她所需要的。它远离城市，因此受到的损害应该是最小的，而且她知道农场往往比城镇或城市住宅更自给自足，因此它为他们提供了最佳的生存机会。

Excitedly she half walked, half ran down the track that led to the small house. As she got closer she saw that even here the last battle had left some scars. Many of the house's windows were broken in and there was a lot of debris around it, but from the outside it seemed structurally sound. She walked around the house, inspecting it and feeling like a prospective buyer.

她兴奋地半走半跑，沿着通往那座小屋的小径前行。随着距离的拉近，她发现即便在这里，上一场战斗也留下了些许痕迹。许多窗户都被打破，周围散落着大量碎片，但从外部看，房屋结构似乎依然稳固。她绕着房子走了一圈，仔细检查，感觉自己就像一个潜在的买家。

"Hmmm, A little run down but a renovator's delight, I'm sure." Feeling a little giddy from her exertions she continued. "Lots of potential, not a bad entry level property for a young couple looking to get into the local real estate market." 'Asuka, you've finally lost your marbles.' She thought to herself.

嗯，虽然有点破旧，但绝对是翻新者的乐园。" 由于刚才的奔波，她感到有些晕眩，继续说道："潜力巨大，对于想要进入当地房地产市场的年轻夫妇来说，这可是一处不错的入门级房产。" 她心中暗想："明日香，你终于还是疯了。

As she rounded the back of the cabin she stopped in her tracks. It had an external water tank! And a chimney. There was even a pile of firewood stacked against the side of the house next to the back door. "Sold!" She cried out loud, laughing to herself. The first time laughter had been heard in that dead World.

当她绕到小屋后面时，她突然停下了脚步。那里有一个外置水箱！还有烟囱。甚至还有一堆木柴整齐地堆放在后门旁边的房子一侧。"成交！"她大声喊道，自顾自地笑了起来。这是那个死寂世界中第一次响起笑声。

Even better some of the windows on this side of the house were intact. That was it, she had found it. She came back around to the front of the building and climbed the steps to the front door, thankfully it was hanging open, the bottom hinge having given way some time ago. She pushed it aside and went in. it was quite dark inside and had a musty, dank smell, but for the first time since she had left the beach she was out of that biting cold wind.

更妙的是，这栋房子这一侧的有些窗户完好无损。就是这里了，她找到了。她绕回到建筑前，登上台阶来到前门，幸好门是半开着的，底部的铰链不知何时已经松脱。她将门推开，走了进去。屋内相当昏暗，弥漫着一股潮湿发霉的气味，但自她离开海滩以来，这是第一次摆脱了那刺骨的寒风。

There were only a couple of rooms in the cottage, and very sparse furnishings. A kind of kitchen/living/dining room in the centre of the building, with an open fireplace. A single bedroom, with a threadbare old futon on the floor and two broken windows. And most glorious of all, a bathroom with an old freestanding iron tub.

小屋内仅有几间房，陈设极为简陋。建筑中央是一间集厨房、客厅与餐厅于一体的多功能室，配有一个开放式壁炉。一间单人卧室，地上铺着一条破旧的蒲团，两扇窗户已损坏。而最令人欣喜的是，一间配有老式独立铸铁浴缸的浴室。

Her mood quickly dropped though as she caught sight of her own reflection in the bathroom mirror. A dirty, dishevelled, sunken cheeked girl looked back at her. Her head and left eye wrapped in filthy bandages and her red hair stiff and unruly, caked with dry LCL.

然而，当她在浴室镜中瞥见自己的倒影时，心情迅速跌落。一个脏兮兮、蓬头垢面、面颊凹陷的女孩回望着她。她的头部和左眼被肮脏的绷带包裹着，红色的头发僵硬而凌乱，沾满了干涸的 LCL。

She poked again gently at the pad over her eye. The pain as she did so was instant and excruciating. She was tempted to peel it off and look underneath the bandages. But she knew that she wasn't ready for that just yet. The time for that would come all too soon.

她再次轻轻地触碰了覆盖在眼睛上的垫子。随之而来的疼痛是即刻且剧烈的。她很想揭开它，看看绷带下的情况。但她知道，现在还不是时候。那一刻很快就会到来。

But not yet. First she had to go and get Shinji. If he was still even there.

但还没到时候。首先，她得去找真嗣。如果他还在那里的话。

Leaving the house, with its outbuildings still unexplored, she set back off to the road and back to the shore where this nightmare had all begun.

她离开那栋主屋，其附属建筑尚未探查，便重新踏上通往海岸的路，那里正是这场噩梦开始的地方。

She found him exactly as she had left him. Hunched over, sitting on the rough sand of the beach, staring blankly out over the red sea. She crouched down in front of him. His eyes were still the same. Dull, devoid of life, unfocussed. Only the shallow rise and fall of his chest and the occasional involuntary blink or shiver gave any sign that he was actually alive.

她发现他一如她离开时的模样。蜷缩着身子，坐在海滩粗糙的沙粒上，茫然凝视着红海。她在他面前蹲下。他的眼神依旧如故，黯淡无光，毫无生气，目光涣散。唯有胸膛微弱的起伏和偶尔不由自主的眨眼或颤抖，才透露出他尚存一丝生机。

"Hey, Shinji." She said gently. "I-I know that I shouldn't have yelled at you or kicked you. Even though you do have a bony ass!" No reply.

"嘿，真嗣。" 她轻声说道，"我、我知道我不该对你大喊大叫，也不该踢你。尽管你的屁股确实挺硌人的！" 没有回应。

"So… Let's start this whole this afresh huh? You forget that I kicked you and I'll forget the whole choking thing… You know… let bygones be bygones and all of that? Hmm… savvy?"

那么…让我们重新开始这一切如何？你忘了我踢过你，我也忘了那次掐脖子的事…你知道的…就让过去的事过去吧，怎么样？嗯…明白吗？

Still no response. She held a hand up to his face. His skin felt warm to touch and she could still see the rise and fall of his chest to prove that he was still alive.

依旧没有回应。她伸手触摸他的脸庞，他的皮肤触感温暖，而且她仍能看见他胸膛的起伏，证明他还活着。

The wind felt like ice against her own exposed skin, and the plugsuit did almost nothing to stop it either.

风如冰刃般刮过她裸露的肌肤，而紧身战斗服也几乎无法阻挡这股寒意。

"Come on Shinji! We need to get off this stupid creepy beach before we die from exposure!" Nothing. "I've found us a place, it's only a couple of miles from here! It's not much, but I think you'll like it!"

快点，真嗣！我们得离开这个荒凉又诡异的沙滩，不然就要因暴露而死了！" 没有回应。"我找到了一个地方，离这里只有几英里！虽然不怎么样，但我想你会喜欢的！"

He blinked and continued his unfocussed stare through her.

他眨了眨眼，继续透过她茫然地凝视着。

"Oh, for fuck's sakes Third Child!" She yelled harshly. "Stop being so fucking pathetic! We need to get to shelter, now! We don't have time for this shit! You can sit around feeling sorry for yourself when we're out of the cold and somewhere safe!"

"哦，真是见鬼了，第三子！" 她厉声喊道，"别再这么窝囊了！我们现在得赶紧去避难所，没时间磨蹭了！等我们脱离寒冷，到了安全的地方，你再自怨自艾也不迟！"

Still he gave no indication of having heard her or even being aware of her presence. Feeling her anguish and frustration building up to unbearable levels she lashed out angrily with her right hand and struck him forcefully across the face.

然而，他依旧没有任何迹象表明听到了她的话，甚至没有意识到她的存在。随着她的痛苦和挫败感累积到难以忍受的程度，她愤怒地挥出右手，狠狠地给了他一个耳光。

"Arrrrrgh! Shit!" She screamed as her whole right arm lit up with unbelievable pain. She collapsed onto the sand in front of Shinji gasping and clutching her arm in agony as it felt as if it was being torn in two. Again.

"啊啊啊！该死！" 她尖叫着，整个右臂被难以置信的疼痛点燃。她倒在真嗣面前的沙滩上，喘着粗气，痛苦地紧抓着自己的手臂，感觉就像要被撕成两半一样。又一次。

Finally, mercifully, the exquisite agony of her right arm died down to the point where it was bearable. She looked up at Shinji from where she lay on the sand. He still sat there unmoved. Only a livid red hand mark on his left cheek giving any sign that she had even touched him.

终于，她的右臂那剧烈的痛苦逐渐减轻到了可以忍受的程度。她躺在沙滩上，抬头望向真嗣，他依旧坐在那里，一动不动。只有他左颊上那道鲜红的掌印，表明她曾触碰过他。

"Well, shit." Asuka gasped getting painfully up onto her feet. "I won't be doing that again!"

“哎呀，糟糕。”明日香痛得倒吸一口凉气，艰难地站起身来。“我可不会再这么干了！”

Feeling the icy wind picking up strength and looking at the way the sky was darkening with threatening clouds she felt that it was time to get off this godforsaken shore and get to the shelter of the old cabin. Seeing there was nothing else for it she hooked her good hand under Shinji's shoulder and heaved. Surprisingly he rose to his feet with far less effort than she had feared it would take.

感受到刺骨的寒风愈发强劲，望着天空中乌云密布、威胁四伏的景象，她觉得是时候离开这片荒凉的海岸，前往那座旧木屋的庇护所了。眼见别无他法，她用那只好手钩住真嗣的肩膀，用力一拉。出乎意料的是，他竟比她预想的要轻松许多地站了起来。

She looked at him suspiciously. His eyes were still flat and dull, no sign of the old Shinji there.

她怀疑地看着他。他的眼神依旧平淡无光，丝毫不见昔日真嗣的影子。

Feeling a little self conscious she grabbed hold of his hand in hers. "You'd better not be faking this Ikari!" She said threateningly.

她感到有些不自在，便紧紧握住了他的手。“你最好别是装出来的，碇！”她威胁地说。

The answer that she didn't expect didn't come.

她意料之外的答案并未到来。

"Come on then." She said, dragging him none too gently up the shore and away from the beach.

"那就来吧。" 她说着，不太温柔地拽着他上了岸，远离了海滩。

Quickly she noticed that as long as she kept pressure on his hand and kept moving he trailed along obediently behind her, but if she let go or stopped he would simply stop moving as if it was only her will that animated him at all. She found this deeply troubling, but at the moment she was also just grateful for the small mercy of being able to get them off that horrible shore and moving.

她很快注意到，只要她持续按压他的手并保持移动，他就会顺从地跟在她后面；但一旦她松手或停下，他也会立刻停止不动，仿佛只有她的意志在驱动他。这让她深感困扰，但此刻，她更感激能带他们离开那可怕的海岸并继续前行的微小恩赐。

She was very keen to leave that place and its horrors behind her and onto the next stage in her life on this cold desolate landscape. Whatever that might be.

她急切地想要离开那个充满恐怖的地方，将一切抛诸脑后，迈向这片寒冷荒凉之地上的生活新阶段。无论那将是什么。

By the time they reached the small farmhouse the sky overhead had grown dark and threatening and the wind had picked up to almost gale force. Her face and ears ached from the cold bite of the air and she could see Shinji's lips had turned a pale shade of blue from the chill.

当他们抵达那座小农舍时，头顶的天空已变得阴沉可怖，风力增强至几乎达到狂风级别。她的脸和耳朵因寒气的侵袭而感到疼痛，她能看见真嗣的嘴唇因寒冷而变得苍白。

None too gently she dragged him up the steps and into the cabin and out of the wind.

她毫不温柔地把他拽上台阶，拉进船舱，避开了风。

"Well, what do you think, Third? It's not much, but it's home!"

“那么，你怎么看，老三？虽然不怎么样，但这里就是家！”

Shinji gave no response or sign that he thought anything about the small cabin.

真嗣对那间小木屋没有任何反应或表示，仿佛心中未曾有过任何想法。

"I knew you'd like it." Asuka said with false cheeriness.

"我就知道你会喜欢的。" 明日香带着假意的欢快说道。

Leaving him standing in the middle of the main room she managed to force open the back door and went back out into the icy wind to gather up some wood for the fireplace. It wasn't easy, as holding anything more than a couple of small logs caused her immediate and intense pain from her arm and torso. After several trips she had a small pile of logs in the grate and several more stacked by the fireplace to last them for a while.

她让他站在主屋中央，自己费力地推开后门，再次走进刺骨的寒风中，为壁炉收集木柴。这并不容易，因为只要拿着超过几根小木头，她的手臂和躯干就会立刻感到剧烈疼痛。经过几次往返，她在壁炉的炉栅里堆起了一小堆木头，旁边还堆放了更多，足够他们用上一阵子。

Scrounging through the kitchen she managed to find a couple of old books of matches and a small bottle of what smelled like kerosene. Liberally dousing the smaller bits of wood with the liquid she finally managed to get one of the matches to light and soon had a small but successful fire underway in the fireplace.

她在厨房里翻找，设法找到了几本旧火柴和一小瓶闻起来像煤油的东西。她慷慨地将液体倒在较小的木块上，终于点燃了一根火柴，很快就在壁炉里燃起了一小堆虽小但成功的火。

"There." She said in a satisfied voice to Shinji. "Not bad if I do say so myself! I am Asuka Langley Soryu, Fire-Bringer!" She said with a flourish.

“就在那儿。”她满意地对真嗣说道，“我得说，还不错！我是明日香·兰格雷·索西尔，火焰使者！”她得意洋洋地宣布。

Shinji remained standing where she had left him, showing not the least recognition of her or of her fire.

真嗣依旧站在她离开他的地方，对她的存在或她的热情毫无察觉。

"Hmph!" She said. "Well it's more than you've done!"

"哼！" 她说，"这比你做的可多多了！"

The next priority for her was gathering up as many large pots and pans as she could find in the cabin and filling them with the rusty tasting water that came into the building from its outside water tank. Over the next while she heated up as much of this water as she could and ferried it across to the freestanding bath. Eventually she had it filled just over halfway with warm water and decided that was probably as much as she could afford to use.

她的下一个优先事项是在小屋里尽可能多地收集大锅和平底锅，并用从屋外水箱流入的带有铁锈味的水将它们装满。接下来的时间里，她尽可能多地加热这些水，并将其运送到独立的浴缸中。最终，她用温水将浴缸填满了一半多一点，并认为这大概就是她能负担得起的最大用量了。

While this was going on she had searched the house more fully and found candles, blankets, towels and a cupboard full of mothball smelling clothing. Most of it was worn and patched looking, as she would have expected to find in an old farm building like this. Obviously this hadn't been a hugely productive or profitable farm in its day. At that stage, she didn't care. Being able to get out of that plugsuit was her number one priority at that moment.

在这期间，她已更彻底地搜查了房子，找到了蜡烛、毯子、毛巾以及一橱柜散发着樟脑丸气味的衣物。大部分衣物都显得破旧且有补丁，正如她所预料，在这样的老农场建筑里会发现的那样。显然，这个农场在其鼎盛时期也并非十分高产或盈利。但那时，她并不在意这些。那一刻，她最迫切的需求就是能脱下那套紧身服。

Outside it was growing darker and the old cabin rattled and banged in the growing storm that was brewing out there. None too gently she pushed Shinji back into one of the armchairs near the fire.

外面天色渐暗，老旧的小屋在愈演愈烈的暴风雨中嘎吱作响。她不太温柔地将真嗣推回到靠近火堆的一把扶手椅上。

"Sit. Wait." She ordered him. "I'm gonna be a while."

"坐下，等着。" 她命令他，"我得一会儿。"

Setting up a couple of candles in the small bathroom she looked nervously at the bandaged face in the mirror. She sighed to herself. "Best do this while the water is still warm…" she stripped off the filthy red plugsuit and threw it to the bathroom floor with a certain amount of revulsion, leaving herself standing completely naked except for her bandages.

在小浴室里摆好几支蜡烛后，她紧张地望向镜中那张缠满绷带的脸。她暗自叹了口气，“趁着水还热，最好快点……”她脱下那件肮脏的红色紧身战斗服，带着几分厌恶将其扔到浴室地板上，只留下满身的绷带，赤裸地站在那里。

She started with her arm. Carefully she began unwrapping the bandages, starting from her right knuckle and working up to her shoulder. Even in the cold she could feel the sweat prickling on her brow from the tension.

她从手臂开始，小心翼翼地着手解开绷带，从右手的指关节处开始，一直向上延伸到肩膀。即便在寒冷中，她也能感觉到因紧张而额头冒出的汗珠。

There it was. Beginning between her 2nd and 3rd knuckles was a livid red scar. She bit her lip painfully at the sight, but didn't stop removing the bandage. Rapidly more of the scar was being revealed. It didn't seem real. It was almost like someone had used a dark red marker to draw a straight line on both sides of her arm, from her hand all the way up to her shoulder. It was too neat, too perfectly straight. She ran her other hand along it. The scar was slightly raised and tender to the touch, but the flesh underneath it was whole.

那里，就在那里。一道青紫色的疤痕从她的第二和第三个指关节之间开始延伸。看到这一幕，她痛苦地咬了咬嘴唇，但并未停下拆绷带的动作。随着绷带的快速脱落，更多的疤痕显露出来。这看起来太不真实了。它几乎像是有人用深红色马克笔在她的手臂两侧画了一条笔直的线，从手部一直延伸到肩膀。太过整齐，直得近乎完美。她用另一只手轻轻抚过它。疤痕微微隆起，触感柔软而敏感，但下面的肌肤却是完整的。

Asuka shuddered at the memory of that very same arm splitting in two during that final battle. How it was whole at all was beyond her ability to comprehend.

阿苏卡一想到那场最终战斗中那条手臂一分为二的情景就不寒而栗。它究竟是如何完好无损的，超出了她的理解能力。

Moving more quickly she removed the wrapping from around her torso. Here also were more red scars scattered across her abdomen and chest. This time they looked more like healed puncture wounds. She counted seven of them. Turning her back to the mirror she gasped to see seven corresponding red exit wounds dotting her pale and bare back.

她加快动作，解开了缠绕在腰间的绷带。这里同样布满了红色的疤痕，散落在她的腹部和胸部。这次，它们看起来更像是已经愈合的穿刺伤口。她数了数，共有七个。转身背对镜子，她倒吸一口凉气，只见苍白裸露的背上，同样有七个对应的红色穿刺出口伤痕。

"Oh… fuck…" she exhaled. “哦……该死……”她喘息着说。

Her body was now completely uncovered. There was only one bandage left to remove.

她的身体现在已经完全暴露。只剩下一个绷带需要拆除。

She stared unblinkingly with her good eye as she gingerly unwrapped the bandage from around her forehead. Her hair had been pressed flat against her head by the bandage so that when it was removed it combined with her wild LCL encrusted hair to give her a wild and unhinged look.

她用那只好眼睛一眨不眨地盯着，小心翼翼地从额头上解开绷带。绷带将她的头发压得紧贴头皮，当绷带被取下时，她的头发与沾满 LCL 的凌乱发丝混合在一起，使她看起来狂野而不羁。

All that was left was the gauze pad that had somehow been taped in place. She looked away from the mirror as she gently pulled the tape away from her skin and removed the pad from over her left eye. Closing her other eye and taking a deep breath she then forced both of them open again.

剩下的只有那块不知怎么被固定住的纱布垫。她避开镜子，轻柔地将胶带从皮肤上撕下，取下了覆盖在左眼上的纱布。闭上另一只眼，深吸一口气后，她强迫自己再次睁开双眼。

Her left eye stung and watered as it opened, but she breathed a massive sigh of relief as she knew that she could definitely still see through it. It was a little blurry due to being held shut for so long but it otherwise moved and focussed in unison with her right eye perfectly.

她的左眼在睁开时感到刺痛并流泪，但当她知道自己确实还能透过它看见时，她长长地松了一口气。由于长时间闭着，视线有些模糊，但除此之外，它与右眼同步移动和聚焦，完美无缺。

"Alright…" She said. "Time to check out the damage."

"好吧……" 她说，"是时候检查一下损坏情况了。"

Turning back to face the mirror she examined the face of the wild haired girl in it closely. The injury to her eye was less dramatic than those on rest of her body, but it just as telling. A small scar ran from above her eyebrow down over her upper eyelid and down her lower lid for about three centimetres or so. Corresponding with those scars was a bloody red line in the white of her left eye that became a much darker line that split the still vivid blue of her iris perfectly down the centre.

她转过身来，面对镜子，仔细端详着镜中那个头发凌乱的女孩的面容。她眼睛上的伤痕相比身体其他部位的伤痕来说，并不那么引人注目，但同样透露着故事。一道小疤痕从她的眉骨上方开始，经过上眼皮，再延伸至下眼皮，大约有三厘米长。与之对应的是，她左眼的白色部分有一条血红色的线条，这条线逐渐变深，完美地将她那依旧鲜亮的蓝色虹膜从中间一分为二。

Leaning her hands on the cold basin she rested her head against the mirror breathing deeply. It was both better and far worse than she had imagined. The relief at actually having an eye underneath that bandage that she could actually see out of was enormous, but… she couldn't escape the fact that she had been disfigured. Asuka Langley Soryu. The top Evangelion Pilot and one of most beautiful and popular girls in her school was a scarred and damaged nobody in a dead and indifferent World.

她双手撑在冰冷的洗手盆上，头靠在镜子上，深呼吸着。这一切比她预想的要好，却又糟糕得多。实际上，从那绷带下能有一只眼睛看见外面，这种解脱感是巨大的，但是……她无法逃避自己已经毁容的事实。惣流·明日香·兰格雷，顶尖的福音战士驾驶员，学校里最美丽、最受欢迎的女孩之一，在这个冷漠无情的世界里，成了一个伤痕累累、无人问津的普通人。

She stood like that for several minutes. Silently letting the tears stream down her face and spatter on the dirty vanity unit before her naked body's uncontrollable shivering brought back to herself.

她就那样站了几分钟，默默地任由泪水顺着脸颊流下，溅落在面前肮脏的梳妆台上，直到她赤裸的身体无法抑制地颤抖，才将她拉回现实。

"Ikuhayo Asuka… That bath isn't getting any hotter."

飞鸟一久…那浴缸的水并没有变得更热。

Strangely, the bath had not been any comfort to her. The dried LCL had taken a lot of scrubbing and effort to get off her skin and hair as the rusty tank water seemed to be impossible to get any kind of lather up in. But eventually she felt that she had cleaned all of the offensive smelling gunk off her body.

奇怪的是，浴缸的水并未给她带来任何慰藉。干掉的 LCL 需要费很大劲才能从皮肤和头发上洗掉，而锈迹斑斑的浴缸水似乎怎么也起不了泡沫。但最终，她觉得自己已经把身上那股难闻的污垢都清洗干净了。

Lying there, naked and alone in a shallow bath full of what was now copper-coloured tepid water had brought back some of the still raw memories of her lowest ebb in the pre-Impact World.

躺在那里，赤裸而孤独地浸在浅浴缸中，那已变成铜色的温水里，唤起了她在冲击前世界最低谷时仍未愈合的记忆。

Dragging her tired and aching body out of the tub she quickly dried off with one of the stiff and scratchy towels before wrapping it around her head and getting into the t-shirt, old cargo pants and hoodie that she had scavenged out of the cupboards. They were all a little too large for her, but after spending untold hours in that filthy and ragged Plug Suit, they felt almost luxurious against her newly scrubbed and sensitive skin.

她拖着疲惫酸痛的身体从浴缸中出来，迅速用一条硬邦邦、粗糙的毛巾擦干，然后将毛巾裹在头上，穿上从橱柜里翻找出来的 T 恤、旧工装裤和连帽衫。这些衣物对她来说都略显宽松，但经历了无数小时在那肮脏破烂的插入服中后，它们紧贴着她刚洗净的敏感肌肤，几乎有种奢华的感觉。

Out in the living room Shinji was exactly where she had left him.

在客厅里，真嗣正坐在她离开时的位置上。

"Hey Baka! What do you think of my new ensemble?" She asked him as she twirled and posed in front of him suggestively. "It's the latest thing from the catwalks of Milan!"

"嘿，笨蛋！你觉得我的新装扮怎么样？" 她在他面前旋转着，摆出挑逗的姿势问道。"这可是米兰时装周上的最新款！"

Shinji remained silent, his fixed thousand-yard stare unwavering.

真嗣保持沉默，他那凝视远方的眼神坚定不移。

"Bah! What would you know anyway?" She said testily. "It's the end of civilisation as we know it and you're still in that stupid school uniform for fuck's sake!"

"哼！你又懂什么？" 她不耐烦地说，"文明就要终结了，你还在穿那该死的校服！"

Annoyingly for Asuka, Shinji remained unmoved by her attack on his fashion sense.

让明日香恼火的是，她对真嗣时尚感的攻击并未让他动摇。

"Hmph… Baka!" She retorted. This was getting her nowhere. Not to mention that she was so bone weary that she felt that just collapsing on the floor in the middle of the room was both an appealing and genuinely viable option. Despite this urge she forced her aching and tired body to the bedroom and dragged the futon grunting and heaving into the living room, roughly throwing it down in front of the fireplace.

"哼…笨蛋！"她反驳道。这根本无济于事。更别提她已经筋疲力尽，感觉在房间中央瘫倒在地既诱人又切实可行。尽管有这种冲动，她还是强迫自己酸痛疲惫的身体走向卧室，拖着沉重的呼吸将蒲团拽到客厅，粗暴地扔在壁炉前。

Stoking up the fire with more logs and arranging the blankets and some cushions from the couch on the futon she stripped off down to the t-shirt, which was thankfully long enough to cover her otherwise bare body down to her thighs, she gratefully crawled under the covers and attempted to get herself comfortable.

她添了些木柴让火更旺，从沙发上取来毯子和几个垫子铺在蒲团上，然后脱得只剩一件 T 恤，幸好它够长，能遮住她裸露的身体直至大腿。她感激地钻进被窝，试图让自己舒服些。

"Don't you even think of trying to get in here with me, Third!" She said warningly. "If you try anything I promise that I will hurt you."

"你休想和我一起进来，第三！" 她警告说，"如果你敢乱来，我保证会让你吃不了兜着走。"

Shinji sat still as a statue on the armchair. Only the white of his shirt and the firelight reflecting off his open eyes in the darkness showing that he was even still there.

真嗣如雕像般静坐在扶手椅上，唯有他衬衫的白色和火光在黑暗中映照在他睁开的双眼上，表明他依然在那里。

"Baka…" She muttered tiredly as she settled under the blankets.

"笨蛋…" 她疲惫地嘟囔着，钻进了被窝。

Despite her weariness she found it impossible to get to sleep. The wind howled angrily outside the small cabin and the shutters creaked and rattled against it. Her arm and body ached and throbbed almost unbearably as she lay there. Each stab of pain reminding her of the brutality of her defeat at the hands of the Eva Series. Whenever she closed her eyes she could see their leering, eyeless faces. Their bright teeth and bloody red lips ripping at her, violating her. She tossed and turned and tried to chase the awful memories away, but they were always waiting, just behind her closed eyelids, to torture and torment her with her complete failure in what had been her final battle.

尽管疲惫不堪，她却发现自己无法入睡。小屋外狂风怒吼，仿佛带着怒气，窗户的遮板吱嘎作响，与之抗衡。她躺在那里，手臂和身体的疼痛几乎难以忍受，每一次刺痛都在提醒她，在伊娃系列手中的惨败是多么残酷。每当她闭上眼睛，就能看到那些面目狰狞、无眼的面孔，它们那闪亮的牙齿和血红的嘴唇撕扯着她，侵犯着她。她辗转反侧，试图驱散这些可怕的记忆，但它们总是守候着，就在她紧闭的眼睑之后，用她最终战斗的彻底失败来折磨和困扰她。

Each time she opened her eyes again she could see Shinji, still sitting there unmoved by her apparent suffering.

每当她再次睁开眼睛，都能看到真嗣依旧坐在那里，对她的明显痛苦无动于衷。

Finally she could take it no longer. "Shit!" She snarled, throwing back the blankets and getting to her feet.

最终她再也忍受不了了。“该死！”她咆哮着，掀开被子站了起来。

"Come on then, idiot." She said to Shinji, pulling him roughly by the arm. With little effort she pushed him towards the futon and forced him to lie down on the side away from the fire. She then huddled back down on the mattress and arranged the blankets over them both.

"那就来吧，傻瓜。" 她对真嗣说道，粗暴地拽着他的胳膊。她几乎没费什么劲就把他推向远离火堆的蒲团，强迫他躺下。随后，她蜷缩回床垫上，将毯子在他们两人身上整理好。

"I'm only doing this for the warmth, Third Child." Asuka said as she got comfortable again. "Just promise you won't go all 'hospital ward room' on me… pervert."

"我这么做只是为了取暖，第三适格者。" 明日香说着，再次调整了一个舒服的姿势。"只要你保证别给我整出那种'医院病房'的氛围来……变态。"

He offered no reply as he lay there staring at the cracked ceiling of the cabin.

他躺在那里，凝视着小屋开裂的天花板，没有给出任何回答。

"I can't believe I'm here, doing this!" Asuka whispered to herself.

"我真不敢相信我在这里，做着这件事！" 明日香自言自语道。

Despite her misgivings, no more nightmares troubled the exhausted girl as she slept into the night and well into the next morning.

尽管心存疑虑，疲惫的女孩在夜深人静时不再受噩梦困扰，一觉睡到天亮，直至次日清晨。

I hope you enjoy this. Either way, please review. As I think my other story showed, I kinda suck at self editing. So please review, it's the only way I'll learn! :)

希望你喜欢这个故事。无论如何，请留下你的评论。正如我另一部作品所展示的，我在自我编辑方面确实不太行。所以请务必评论，这是我学习的唯一途径！:)

Cheers! 干杯！

## Chapter 2 Persistence of Being 存在的持久性

Even though the wind had died down to nothing overnight, the cold air still bit at her bare cheeks and made her eyes sting and water.

尽管夜间风已完全停息，但冷空气依旧刺痛着她裸露的双颊，令她的眼睛感到刺痛并流泪。

The dawn had long since passed by the time she had awoken and the feeble daylight had lit the interior of the cabin drearily. She had disentangled herself from the prone Third Child and got out of bed.

当她醒来时，黎明早已过去，微弱的天光阴沉地照亮了小屋内部。她从躺着的第三个孩子身边挣脱出来，下了床。

After stoking up the fire and getting herself dressed she had explored the cupboards in the tiny kitchen. She avoided the chunky old refrigerator, God only knew what mouldy horrors lurked in that thing after so long without power. Fresh food was definitely going to be a luxury for the time being.

生火穿衣后，她探查了狭小厨房里的橱柜。她避开了那台笨重的老冰箱，天知道在这么久没电的情况下，里面会藏着什么发霉的恐怖之物。新鲜食物在一段时间内无疑将成为奢侈品。

Luckily there was a large stock of instant and canned food in the kitchen, so starvation was less of an imminent threat than she had feared it would be. Though the thought of living on such fare was less than thrilling to the German girl.

幸运的是，厨房里储备了大量即食和罐头食品，因此饥饿的威胁并不像她原先担心的那样迫在眉睫。尽管对于这位德国女孩来说，以这样的食物为生并不令人兴奋。

"Oh well, I guess if Misato managed to survive on this shit for nearly thirty years, we should do okay."

哦，好吧，既然 Misato 能靠这种东西活了近三十年，我们应该也没问题。

She chose a couple of tins of beans and poured them into a small pot. Padding back into the main room she placed the pot over the fire and set it heating.

她挑选了几罐豆子，倒入一个小锅里。走回主房间，她将锅放在火上加热。

"Come on lunkhead!" She said to Shinji as she dragged him out of bed. "Today is your lucky day! I'm making you breakfast!"

快点，笨蛋！" 她对真嗣说道，一边把他从床上拽起来。"今天是你的幸运日！我要给你做早餐！

She led Shinji into the kitchen and sat him down at the small table there. She set two bowls and spoons down on the table and went back to the fire, returning minutes later with the steaming pot in her hands.

她领着真嗣走进厨房，让他坐在那张小桌子旁。她摆好两个碗和勺子，然后回到火边，几分钟后，手里端着热气腾腾的锅回来了。

After serving up the meagre breakfast she sat down opposite the boy.

端上简单的早餐后，她坐在男孩对面。

"Eat up Blunder boy!" She said.

"快吃吧，糊涂小子！" 她说。

Shinji just continued to stare into nothingness.

真嗣只是继续凝视着虚无。

"Oh, for fuck's sake!" She said in annoyance. "Eat it Baka! I'm not gonna feed your lazy ass!"

哦，真他妈的！" 她恼怒地说，"吃吧，笨蛋！我才不会喂你这个懒鬼！

Still he failed to move or acknowledge her.

他依然没有移动，也没有对她作出任何反应。

"For the love of Vishnu!" She exclaimed, pushing her chair back roughly so that it fell over with a bang. She stomped over to his side if the table, shoved a spoon into his hand and guided it into the bowl, scooped up a spoonful of beans and brought it up to his mouth. To her surprise and relief he opened up and took the food into it. Chewing mechanically before finally swallowing. She let go of his hand and the spoon again lowered into the bowl and brought up more beans and repeated the procedure.

"看在毗湿奴的份上！" 她惊呼道，猛地推开椅子，椅子砰的一声倒地。她大步走到他那边的桌子旁，把勺子塞进他手里，引导它伸进碗里，舀起一勺豆子送到他嘴边。令她惊讶又宽慰的是，他张开嘴接受了食物。机械地咀嚼后，最终咽了下去。她松开他的手，勺子再次沉入碗中，舀起更多豆子，重复这一过程。

"Shinji?" Asuka said in surprise, looking at him. His face still showed no sign of recognition for what he was doing, but his hand moved up and down mechanically, quickly finishing the contents of the bowl. Now the spoon was still moving up and down as before, but no food was being brought up to his face. She grabbed his hand in mid motion, pulled the spoon out of it.

"真嗣？"明日香惊讶地说道，看着他。他的脸上仍然没有表现出对自己行为的认识，但他的手机械地上下移动，迅速吃完了碗里的食物。现在勺子仍然像以前一样上下移动，但没有食物被送到他的嘴里。她在中途抓住了他的手，把勺子从他手中抽了出来。

"Enough Shinji. You can stop now." The boy stopped his movements and returned to sitting there as before.

"够了，真嗣。你可以停下来了。"男孩停止了动作，恢复到之前坐着的状态。

"Well, I guess that's a small mercy," She said to herself. "I wasn't keen on having to spoon-feed you until the rest of the World catches up with us!"

"嗯，我想这算是个小小的恩惠吧，"她自言自语道，"我可不热衷于一直得喂你吃饭，直到世界其他地方赶上我们！"

His vacant stare was her only reply.

他那空洞的凝视是她唯一的回答。

She sat back down and began to eat her own bowl of food. As she ate she realised just how hungry she actually was. The meagre fare before her felt like just about the most delicious thing that she had ever tasted. Before she knew it, the bowl was empty. She pushed the bowl away from her. Despite the food in her belly, she still felt empty inside. With her hunger sated, she figured could finally try and make sense of the situation that she found herself in.

她重新坐下，开始吃自己那碗食物。吃着吃着，她意识到自己原来有多饿。眼前这简陋的食物，感觉几乎成了她尝过的最美味的东西。不知不觉中，碗已见底。她把碗推开，尽管胃里有了食物，内心却依旧空虚。饥饿缓解后，她觉得终于可以尝试理清自己所处的境况了。

The whole Instrumentality thing… That had been a total Mind-fuck for sure. She had seen her own existence, and that of those around her from every perspective at once. It had been a livid, excoriating experience as all of her mental and emotional barriers had been ripped away and the Asuka Langley Soryu that she felt she was had been brutally meshed with the Asuka Langley Soryu the rest of the World knew.

整个人类补完计划……那绝对是一次彻底的精神冲击。她从各个角度同时看到了自己的存在，以及周围人的存在。那是一次激烈而痛苦的体验，她所有的精神与情感屏障被撕裂，她自认为的惣流·明日香·兰格雷与世界所认识的惣流·明日香·兰格雷被残酷地融合在一起。

She shuddered at the memory. It had been like being ripped bloody and raw all over again, only to have your closest friends and loved ones come and stick their hands in the gaping wounds and proceed to pry them open even further.

她一想到那段记忆就不寒而栗。那感觉就像再次被撕扯得血肉模糊，而最亲近的朋友和亲人却走过来，将手伸进那敞开的伤口，进一步将其撕裂。

And then… Then she had woken up on that beach, with Shinji choking her while weeping inconsolably on top of her. At that moment, she had only felt resignation. She had seen in Instrumentality how he had suffered. How much they were the same. She had wanted him to know that. To understand.

然后……她在那片海滩上醒来，真嗣一边在她身上哭泣着，一边掐着她的脖子。那一刻，她只感到无奈。她在人类补完计划中看到了他的痛苦。他们有多么相似。她希望他能知道这一点。去理解。

To know that she understood his pain now. That it was okay. That was why she had touched his face. The last thing that she remembered from that moment was her own puzzlement at being alive while the boy wept inconsolably on top of her.

她现在明白他的痛苦了，这没关系。这就是为什么她触摸了他的脸。她对那一刻最后的记忆是她自己对活着的困惑，而男孩在她身上无法安慰地哭泣。

Then, when she had awoken again. He was like this. She would have rather him try to kill her again than be this. An empty shell, hollow and unresponsive.

然后，当她再次醒来时，他变成了这样。她宁愿他再次试图杀死她，也不愿他变成这样。一个空壳，空洞且毫无反应。

She looked at his face searchingly. "Are you still in there Shinji? Please talk to me… I don't think that I can do this by myself… Shinji, please…"

她审视地看着他的脸。“你还在那里吗，真嗣？请和我说话……我觉得我一个人做不到……真嗣，求你了……”

Unexpectedly she could feel the small prickling of tears forming in her eyes. "Come on, I know you must be able to hear me." She reached across the table and held his hands in her own. "I don't care about the past, I don't care that you couldn't save me from… from the Eva Series. I don't even care about what you did in the Hospital." She pleaded with him. "Just come back Shinji. I need you… don't leave me alone again, don't abandon me!" She sniffed.

出乎意料地，她感觉到眼角有泪珠在刺痛。"拜托，我知道你一定能听见我。"她伸手越过桌子，握住他的手。"我不在乎过去，不在乎你没能从……从 Eva 系列中救出我。我甚至不在乎你在医院所做的一切。"她恳求着他。"只是回来吧，真嗣。我需要你……别再让我孤单一人，别再抛弃我！"她抽了抽鼻子。

The silence that engulfed the World became even more oppressive.

笼罩世界的寂静变得更加压抑。

Asuka fought it, but she could feel the old her welling up inside her chest. The angry bitter girl that she was once had not been killed off completely by Third Impact. She hadn't been destroyed by the teeth and claws of Evangelions 05 -13 to rise phoenix like on the dead Shore. She had thought that the old Asuka was rotting unmourned in the depths of the Geo-Front. She now realised that part of her was very much alive and crying out for attention. Her despair made it easy to give in to it.

明日香与之抗争，但她能感觉到曾经的自己正从胸中涌起。那个愤怒而苦涩的女孩，并未被第三次冲击彻底抹杀。她并未被 EVA 05 至 13 号的利齿和爪牙摧毁，从而如凤凰般在死亡的海岸上重生。她曾以为旧日的明日香已在地下都市的深处无声腐朽。如今她意识到，那一部分自己依然鲜活，渴望关注，而绝望使她轻易屈服于它。

"Fine!" She yelled, lashing out at him with her open hand and slapping him forcefully across the face. "Ignore me, abandon me! Everyone else fucking well has! But get this, I won't give in! You understand me Third Child?" She spat out angrily. "I'm not gonna be beaten by this. You can give in if you want! It's what you're good at after all, but I'm better than this! I'm Asuka Langley-Fucking-Soryu! I will not be beaten! You hear me?"

"好极了！"她吼叫着，猛地挥手给了他一个响亮的耳光。"无视我，抛弃我！每个人都他妈的这样！但听着，我不会屈服！你明白我的意思吗，三子？"她愤怒地吐出这些话。"我不会被这打败。如果你想屈服，随你的便！毕竟这是你的强项，但我比这更强！我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！我不会被打败！你听见了吗？"

Shinji remained unmoved by her outburst. Only a red mark on his cheek and the painful throbbing of her own hand remained as recognition of her rage.

真嗣对她的爆发不为所动。只有他脸颊上的红印和她自己手上的痛感，作为她愤怒的见证。

"Shit!" She screamed in anguish. "I can't fucking take this!" She threw the chair aside and stomped out of the room. She grabbed one of the blankets off the floor and wrapped it around her shoulders and stormed out of the cabin.

"该死！"她痛苦地尖叫着，"我他妈的受不了了！"她把椅子甩到一边，跺着脚走出了房间。她从地上抓起一条毯子，裹在肩上，怒气冲冲地冲出了小屋。

So there she was, standing out in the cold with the still air biting at her face and eyes. The rage within her had withered as quickly as it had risen, leaving her feeling drained and empty. She needed to get a grip if she was going to survive this nightmare. Useless displays of anger were futile and unhelpful.

她就那样站在寒冷中，静止的空气刺痛着她的脸庞和双眼。内心的怒火来得快去得也快，留下的是疲惫和空虚。若想挺过这场噩梦，她必须稳住自己。无谓的愤怒表现既徒劳又无益。

She huffed a warm breath into her hands to try and ward off the chill.

她向双手哈了一口热气，试图驱散寒意。

The sky above was still dark with cloud, making what light there was from the hidden sun pale and weak. She noticed with some alarm that the earth had been covered with a thick layer of snow overnight that crunched under her feet as she walked away from the cabin towards the small huddle of outbuildings attached to the farm.

头顶的天空依旧乌云密布，使得那本就隐匿的阳光显得苍白无力。她有些惊慌地注意到，一夜之间大地已被厚厚的积雪覆盖，当她离开小屋向农场附属的那一小簇外屋走去时，脚下传来嘎吱作响的声音。

The first one had a small door with small panes of frosted glass in the top half. She tried the handle, but it was locked. Searching around her she found a fist sized rock and used it to smash the glass closest to the handle. She then carefully reached though and unlocked the door from that side and let herself in.

第一个门上部镶有小块磨砂玻璃，门很小。她试着转动把手，但门锁着。环顾四周，她找到一块拳头大小的石头，用它砸碎了离把手最近的玻璃。随后，她小心翼翼地伸手进去，从那边打开了门锁，并让自己进入了室内。

Inside the small lined shed it was surprisingly cosy. It had obviously been some kind of workshop as the walls were lined with hand tools and a couple of axes as well as a small bench with an engineers vise bolted to it. She was drawn to the far end of the shed where an old tarpaulin covered a large pile of items.

在这间狭小而衬里的棚屋内，出乎意料地温馨。显然，这里曾是一个工作坊，墙壁上挂满了手工工具，还有几把斧头，以及一张装有工程师用虎钳的小长凳。她被吸引到了棚屋的尽头，那里有一块旧防水布覆盖着一大堆物品。

She pulled the tarpaulin aside and surveyed the various sized crates that were beneath it. All of them were padlocked so she searched around for the keys. After twenty minutes of increasingly frustrating searching she found a hidden compartment underneath the workbench. Much to her relief there was a large ring of keys secreted within it.

她将防水布拉开，审视着下面大小不一的板条箱。所有的箱子都上了锁，于是她开始四处寻找钥匙。经过二十分钟越来越令人沮丧的搜寻，她在工作台下发现了一个隐藏的隔间。令她大为宽慰的是，里面藏有一大串钥匙。

The third key that she tried opened the largest of the crates. Inside were a dozen or so thick blankets, some dehydrated military style ration packs and emergency flares. She grinned despite herself. Obviously the previous occupant of this farm had been some kind of survivalist. The post Second Impact World had been full of them, even in Japan. People who had seen how Civilisation had crumbled in the years following the disaster and had prepared themselves for it happening again.

她尝试的第三把钥匙打开了最大的那个板条箱。里面装着大约十几条厚毛毯，一些脱水军用口粮包和应急信号弹。她不由自主地露出了笑容。显然，这个农场的前任主人是个生存主义者。第二次冲击后的世界里，这样的人比比皆是，甚至在日本的土地上也不例外。那些目睹了灾难后几年文明如何崩塌的人们，已经为此再次发生做好了准备。

"Thank you Mister Nut-Job." She said happily looking at the contents of the crate.

"谢谢你，坚果先生。" 她开心地说道，目光投向了箱子里的东西。

At the bottom of the crate, hidden under the blankets was a long, narrow box that took up nearly the whole length of the larger crate. She lifted it out of the crate, grunting at the unexpected weight of it. No matter which key she tried nothing was able to fit into and unlock this box. She set it aside for later investigation.

在板条箱底部，隐藏在毯子下的是一个狭长的盒子，几乎占据了整个大箱子的长度。她费力地将其从箱中取出，对这出乎意料的重量发出一声咕哝。无论尝试哪把钥匙，都无法插入并打开这个盒子。她决定将其搁置一旁，留待稍后探究。

The next crate contained several Hurricane lanterns as well as a couple of heavy torches and batteries, as well as a pile of hessian sacks that she assumed were for sandbags. Another contained various items of clothing that looked like they had been gathered from a hundred different Op-Shops. Much of it was far too large for her, but there were a couple of real finds amongst them. Including a faded grey duffel coat that she immediately put on over her clothing. The heavy material helped her to feel warmer almost instantly.

下一个板条箱里装着几盏飓风灯、几把沉重的手电筒和电池，还有一堆黄麻袋，她猜想是用来装沙袋的。另一个箱子里装着各式各样的衣物，看起来像是从上百家二手店收集来的。大部分衣服对她来说都太大了，但其中也有几件真正的宝贝。包括一件褪色的灰色粗呢大衣，她立刻就穿在了衣服外面。厚重的面料让她几乎立刻感到温暖了许多。

The last crate was a battered, dark green, metal one. There was some kind of writing on the top in English and also a writing that she couldn't understand. What did pique her interest was a series of numbers across seeming to indicate that this had been an ammunition box.

最后一个箱子是一个破旧的深绿色金属箱。顶部用英文写着一些字，还有她看不懂的文字。引起她兴趣的是一串数字，似乎表明这是一个弹药箱。

Fumbling through the keys she managed to find the one that opened the lock. Excitedly she threw open the lid and gasped in amazement.

她摸索着钥匙，终于找到了能打开锁的那一把。她兴奋地掀开盖子，惊讶得倒吸一口凉气。

She had been right, the interior of the crate glittered dully with the hundreds of brass cartridges, each ending in a long pointed bullet, that filled the box almost to the top. Several speed loading stripper clips lay on the very top, each with five rounds neatly loaded into them, a small container to the side contained a dozen or so more empty clips.

她果然没猜错，箱子内部因数百枚黄铜弹壳而显得暗淡闪烁，每枚弹壳末端都装有长尖的子弹，几乎填满了整个箱子。最上面散落着几个快速装弹的弹夹，每个都整齐地装载了五发子弹，旁边一个小容器里还装着大约十几个空弹夹。

Also in this container was a single brass key. That might just answer the question of what was in the long narrow box she had found earlier! Excitedly she grabbed it and tried it on the box. She almost squealed with delight as the lock clicked and turned smoothly.

这个容器里还有一把单独的黄铜钥匙。这或许能解答她早先发现的那个长窄盒子里面究竟是什么的疑问！她兴奋地抓起钥匙，试着将其插入盒子。当锁咔哒一声顺滑地转动时，她几乎高兴得尖叫起来。

Flipping up the latch she wasted no time in opening the box and looking at what lay inside.

她迅速翻起搭扣，毫不迟疑地打开盒子，查看里面的东西。

"Holy crap!" She gasped in disbelief. "It's a fucking antique!"

"天哪！" 她难以置信地倒吸一口凉气，"这他妈是个古董啊！"

Inside the box lay an old bolt-action rifle. It's barrel almost entirely encased in dark wood ending at a kind of snub nosed sight at one end and the butt of the rifle had a brass shoulder plate at the other. In front of the trigger guard an angled detachable magazine protruded. A webbing strap hung from swivels at the front and back of it for ease of carrying.

盒子里躺着一支老式手动步枪，其枪管几乎完全被深色木头包裹，一端是短鼻状的瞄准具，另一端则是带有黄铜肩托的枪托。扳机护圈前，一个倾斜的可拆卸弹匣突出。前后旋转接头处挂有网状背带，便于携带。

Also in the box was a long knife. It had to be well over a foot long. Picking it up she realised it was actually a bayonet, and obviously went with the rifle in the box. She placed the knife to one side and picked up the rifle. She was surprised at just how heavy it was. She worked the bolt back and forth, the action was smooth and quick, obviously the previous owner had maintained the old weapon well.

盒子里还有一把长刀，长度肯定超过一英尺。她拿起它时意识到这其实是一把刺刀，显然是与盒子里的步枪配套的。她将刀放在一边，拿起步枪。她惊讶于它竟如此沉重。她来回拉动枪栓，动作流畅迅速，显然前任主人对这把老武器保养得很好。

"Just how old is this thing anyway?"

这东西到底有多古老呢？

There was some faded lettering stamped into the metal near the back of the bolt. She squinted in the dim light of the shed as she tried to read it. She could make out a crown at the top, with G R stamped beneath it. Below that was stamped:

在螺栓后部的金属上，有些褪色的字母印记。她在棚屋昏暗的光线下眯起眼睛试图辨认。她能看出顶部有一个王冠图案，其下印着 G R。再往下则印着：

BSA Co BSA 公司

1917

SHT. L.E.

III 来源文本：III 翻译文本：III *

"1917!" Asuka exclaimed. "This things nearly a hundred fucking years old!"

"1917 年！" 明日香惊呼道，"这玩意儿都快他妈的一百年了！"

Asuka had been trained in most kinds of weapons, so even though it was ancient, it was fairly easy for her to grasp its operation. She grabbed two of the stripper clips and pulled back the bolt on the firearm, deftly loading them into the magazine and pushing the bolt back into the receiver and effectively making it 'live'. She then stood up and slung the rifle over her shoulder before turning and exiting the shed, shutting the door behind her.

明日香受过各种武器的训练，因此尽管这件武器古老，她仍能轻松掌握其操作。她抓起两个弹夹，熟练地拉开枪栓，将它们装入弹匣，再将枪栓推回机匣，使其处于待发状态。随后，她站起身，将步枪挎在肩上，转身离开小屋，随手关上了门。

The cold air hit her immediately, almost driving the air from her lungs. She pulled the collar of the duffel coat up around her ears and tried her best to ignore it.

寒风立刻袭来，几乎夺走了她肺中的空气。她将粗呢大衣的领子拉至耳边，尽力不去理会这刺骨的寒冷。

"Right… Let's see if this relic actually works!" She said out loud. The words disappearing immediately into the frigid air.

"好吧……让我们看看这个古董到底能不能用！" 她大声说道。话音刚落，便立刻消散在寒冷的空气中。

She looked around, eventually spotting and old 44 gallon drum lying in a pile of debris and refuse about 80 metres away towards the road. She dialled in the distance and braced the rifle against her right shoulder, clearing her mind of everything else as she let out a slow controlled breath and squeezed the trigger.

她环顾四周，最终发现了一个旧的 44 加仑油桶，它躺在一堆废墟和垃圾中，距离约 80 米，靠近道路。她调整了瞄准距离，将步枪稳稳地抵在右肩上，清空思绪，缓缓地控制呼吸，然后扣动了扳机。

BOOM! 轰隆！

The kick of the rifle caught her a little by surprise, and did nothing to improve the searing pain in her arm and shoulder. The noise was even more terrific. She was well trained in firearms, far more than the other two Children had been, but that had been in the controlled environment of firing ranges with ear muffs and modern weapons. This was much different. The sound of the old gun echoed endlessly around the hills around her, making her feel exposed and vulnerable. She cycled the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge and reloading a fresh round into the chamber. If anything out there had heard the noise, she wanted to be ready for it.

步枪的后坐力让她略感意外，丝毫没有缓解她手臂和肩膀上灼热的疼痛。枪声更是震耳欲聋。她接受过严格的枪械训练，远超其他两个孩子的水平，但那是在配备耳罩和现代武器的射击场内进行的。现在的情况截然不同。老旧枪械的声响在周围的山丘间回荡不绝，让她感到暴露无遗，脆弱不堪。她拉动枪栓，退出空弹壳，重新将一发新子弹推入枪膛。如果有什么东西听到了那声响，她希望自己已做好准备应对。

She walked closer to the drum, she smiled to herself to see that she had been dead on target.

她走近鼓边，心中暗自微笑，因为她发现自己完全命中了目标。

"I've still got it!" She exclaimed, rubbing her still aching shoulder.

"我还没老呢！"她大声说道，同时揉着依旧疼痛的肩膀。

Feeling just that little bit less vulnerable, she slung the old rifle over her shoulder and headed back to explore the other outbuildings on the property.

感觉稍微不那么脆弱了，她把那把旧步枪挎在肩上，转身回去探索这片地产上的其他附属建筑。

The smaller of the two remaining sheds was stacked high with split firewood that looked like it had been gathered from deadfall from a large area. Apart from a couple of vile smelling empty 44-Gallon drums there was nothing else of interest in there.

剩下的两个小屋中较小的一个堆满了劈好的木柴，看起来像是从大片区域收集的枯木。除了几个散发着恶臭的空 44 加仑桶外，里面没有其他有趣的东西。

All that remained to explore was the larger curved roofed one. It had the look of an old Nissen Hut, as incongruous as that seemed in 21st Century Japan, and had a pair of wide heavy wooden doors at one end with a rusty old padlock sealing them shut.

剩下的待探索之地便是那个较大的弧形屋顶建筑。它看起来像是一座古老的尼森式小屋，在 21 世纪的日本显得格格不入，一端设有一对宽大厚重的木门，门上挂着一把锈迹斑斑的老旧挂锁，紧紧封闭着。

None of the keys she had even fit in the ancient padlock, so she trudged back to the first building , plucked a large pair of bolt cutters off the wall and went back to the locked doors. After perhaps 15 minutes of increasingly frustrating and profanity riddled mangling of the lock it finally disintegrated and fell to the snowy ground with a thud.

她手中的钥匙没有一把能插入那古老的挂锁，于是她拖着沉重的步伐回到第一栋建筑，从墙上取下一把大型的剪线钳，再次返回那扇紧锁的门。大约经过 15 分钟愈发令人沮丧且夹杂着咒骂的尝试，锁终于支离破碎，砰的一声掉落在雪地上。

"Halle-fucking-lujah!" Asuka snarled in relief, heaving the heavy doors open and looking inside.

"哈利路亚，他妈的！" 明日香如释重负地咆哮着，用力推开沉重的门，向内望去。

Inside the dim shed the dusty outline of an old white van could be made out. She let out a large breath in wonder at it. It was the first vehicle that she had seen in any sort of halfway salvageable condition since Third Impact. Unslinging the rifle and leaning it against the wall she walked around to the drivers side of the van. The door creaked and protested as she opened it and looked inside.

昏暗的棚屋内，一辆布满灰尘的旧白色货车轮廓依稀可辨。她惊叹地深吸一口气。这是自第三次冲击以来，她见到的第一辆尚算可修复的车辆。她卸下步枪，靠在墙上，绕到货车驾驶座一侧。随着她打开车门，门发出吱嘎的抗议声，她向内望去。

It was dirty and the seats were ripped and covered in filth, but everything that needed to be there seemed to be there. She climbed into the van and sat in the driver's seat. The Column Shift felt a little crappy, and the amount of play in the steering was remarkable, but Asuka felt that she could make it work. Flipping the visor down a set of rusty keys fell into her lap.

车内脏乱不堪，座椅破损且污秽覆盖，但所需之物似乎一应俱全。她爬进货车，坐上驾驶座。换挡杆手感略显劣质，方向盘的游隙之大令人瞩目，但明日香觉得她能驾驭。翻下遮阳板，一串锈迹斑斑的钥匙落入她怀中。

"Bingo!" She exclaimed. "Things are definitely looking up!" She inserted the key into the ignition and pumped the throttle as she turned it.

"宾果！"她欢呼道，"情况肯定在好转！"她将钥匙插入点火器，一边转动一边踩下油门。

Then nothing. 然后什么也没有。

"Oh you are fucking joking me!"

哦，你他妈的在跟我开玩笑吧！

She turned the key again.

她再次转动钥匙。

"Come on you stupid piece of shit!" She yelled at it. "Just fucking start!"

“快点，你这该死的东西！”她对着它吼道，“赶紧给我启动！”

The van stubbornly refused to obey her. She pounded her fists on the steering wheel.

货车固执地拒绝听从她。她用拳头猛击方向盘。

"Start, God Damn it! Start, you Japanese pile of shit! Is that too much to fucking well ask? Just one thing to go right in this stupid miserable shit-heap of a World?" Tears of frustration and rage were starting to forming in her eyes, stinging fiercely in her injured eye socket.

"开始啊，该死的！开始啊，你这堆日本垃圾！这他妈的要求过分吗？在这个愚蠢悲惨的垃圾世界里，就不能有一件事顺利吗？" 她的眼中开始涌出挫败与愤怒的泪水，刺痛着她受伤的眼窝。

"Aaaaaaargh!" Asuka screamed at the top of her lungs, making her throat raw and echoing hollowly in the old shed. She leapt out of the van and began to kick at its faded panels and pummelling the drivers side door with her fists until they began to bleed. Her curses in time with the rhythm of her attack on the ancient vehicle.

"啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！" 明日香用尽全力尖叫，声音在老旧的棚屋中空洞地回响，让她的喉咙都变得生疼。她从货车里跳出来，开始猛踢那些褪色的车身板，并用拳头不断捶打驾驶座一侧的车门，直到双手开始流血。她的咒骂声与对这辆古董车的攻击节奏同步。

Slowly the throbbing pain in her knuckles began to work its way into her consciousness and her screaming and pummelling slowed to a halt. She collapsed against the side of the van and just lay there, propped up against the cold metal of it, her breathing coming in ragged gasps.

慢慢地，她指关节的跳痛开始侵入她的意识，她的尖叫和捶打逐渐停了下来。她瘫倒在货车的一侧，就这样倚靠着冰冷的金属，呼吸急促而不均匀。

She looked at her hands, noting the blood that now covered them, her own from her childish temper tantrum. Her right hand was really beginning to hurt now that she had stopped abusing it. The scar looked darker and more angry than it had and the pain ran the length of it and up into her shoulder.

她看着自己的双手，注意到上面沾满了血迹，那是她因幼稚的脾气发作而自伤的结果。她的右手在停止自虐后，现在真的开始感到疼痛了。那道疤痕看起来比之前更深、更显得愤怒，疼痛感沿着疤痕一直延伸到她的肩膀。

"Well, that achieved a lot." She said sardonically to herself.

“呵，这可真有成效。”她自嘲地对自己说。

She climbed wearily to her feet and explored the old shed further. Several more 44 gallon drums took up the rest of the space inside. Some were empty, but at least four or five sounded full when she tapped them. Hoping against hope the unscrewed the small cap on one of them and smelled the contents. The sickly smell of petroleum greeted her nostrils, forcing her to gag and retch painfully. Still she smiled to herself. It was a small price to pay.

她疲惫地站起身，继续探索那间旧棚屋。里面剩下的空间被几个 44 加仑的桶占据。有些是空的，但至少四五个在她轻敲时听起来是满的。她抱着一线希望，拧开其中一个的小盖子，闻了闻里面的东西。一股刺鼻的石油味扑鼻而来，让她痛苦地干呕起来。尽管如此，她还是暗自笑了。这点代价微不足道。

"Finally, something is going my way!" She muttered. With the stock of petrol in there she just needed a way to get the old van moving and suddenly prospects of survival were looking far better than they had.

"终于，事情开始顺我的意了！" 她喃喃自语。有了那里的汽油储备，她只需找到让旧货车动起来的方法，突然间，生存的前景看起来比之前好多了。

She wracked her brain. If she could just get it moving then just maybe there was some hope of a roll start. The only problem being that she didn't think in her weakened and injured state that she would have the strength to push the van out of the shed, let alone get it moving fast enough to get it started.

她绞尽脑汁。如果她能让它动起来，或许还有一线希望通过滚动启动。唯一的问题是，她觉得自己在虚弱和受伤的状态下，没有足够的力气把货车推出棚子，更别提让它快速移动以启动了。

"Come on Soryu, think!... If only Stupid Shinji mentally wasn't out to lunch he could help me get this old heap of shit moving! Unless…" A thought struck her.

来吧，Soryu，动动脑筋！...要是那个笨蛋真嗣没在发呆，他就能帮我让这堆破烂动起来了！除非……" 一个念头突然闪过她的脑海。

Within just a few short minutes she had the Third Child rugged up and she dragged him out to the outbuilding. She positioned him at the back of the vehicle, with his arms braced on the tailgate. Asuka took up position on the right hand side of the van, just next to the open driver's door. She reached in and turned the key to the 'On' position.

短短几分钟内，她便将第三适格者裹得严严实实，并拽着他来到外屋。她让他站在车辆后方，双臂撑在尾门上。明日香则站在货车右侧，紧挨着敞开的驾驶室门。她伸手进去，将钥匙转到“开启”位置。

"Okay Shinji!" She yelled out as she released the handbrake. "Let's roll!"

"好的，真嗣！" 她喊着松开了手刹，"我们出发吧！"

She set her shoulder to the door and pushed with all of her might. "Gnnnaaaarrrrgh!" She grunted at the exertion. "Come on Baka, Push!"

她将肩膀顶在门上，用尽全力推着。“呃啊啊啊！”她因用力而发出哼声。“加油，笨蛋，推啊！”

At first there was frustratingly little movement, but slowly the wheels began to move and the van rolled towards the door of the shed. It picked up more speed as it crossed the threshold and crunched across the icy gravel in front of the outbuildings. She looked back to see that Shinji was still moving with the van, his hands propped against the back of it. She had hoped that seeing as he seemed to just do things until made to stop, maybe if she could get him leaning against the van, and get it moving just a little bit, the momentum would just keep him walking and therefore helping her push the vehicle along. She was almost amazed that it actually seemed to be working!

起初，几乎没有什么进展，令人沮丧，但渐渐地，车轮开始转动，货车缓缓向棚屋的门驶去。当它越过门槛，碾过前面附属建筑的冰冷砾石时，速度逐渐加快。她回头一看，发现真嗣仍然跟着货车移动，双手撑在车后。她曾希望，既然他似乎总是做事直到被迫停止，也许如果她能让他靠在货车上，并使其稍微移动，那么惯性就会让他继续行走，从而帮助她推动车辆。她几乎惊讶地发现，这招似乎真的奏效了！

Almost giddy with the thrill of actually making something happen for once in this unnaturally quiet World, Asuka began to laugh out loud at the sheer lunacy of the spectacle they must present, if there were any person alive to actually see it.

在这个异常寂静的世界里，难得能真正促成一些事情，这让明日香几乎兴奋得飘飘然。她开始放声大笑，想象着如果有活人目睹这一幕，他们所呈现的荒诞景象必定令人捧腹。

Pulling the steering wheel around to aim the van down the long driveway of the property, she increased her running pace further and deftly grabbed hold of the handle and swung herself into the driver's seat and slammed the door shut after her.

她将方向盘转向，瞄准庄园的长车道，加快了奔跑速度，灵巧地抓住把手，一跃进入驾驶座，随后砰地关上车门。

"Here goes nothing!" She yelled as she depressed the clutch pedal and manhandled the column shifter into second gear.

"这就开始了！" 她喊道，同时踩下离合器踏板，用力将换挡杆推入二档。

Immediately the van lurched and coughed, throwing her painfully into the steering wheel and adding bruised ribs to her growing catalogue of injuries. After a couple more violent jerks and lurches the old engine spat and spluttered into life. Quickly she pumped the throttle pedal in a desperate attempt to keep the neglected old engine running.

货车立刻颠簸着咳嗽起来，将她猛地摔向方向盘，肋骨的瘀伤又添一笔，使她本就不断增加的伤势更加严重。经过几次剧烈的颠簸和摇晃，老旧的引擎终于噼里啪啦地启动了。她迅速踩下油门踏板，拼命试图维持这被忽视已久的引擎运转。

The old van backfired and coughed noisily, but somehow it didn't die, and before she knew it she was all the way down to the main road that ran past their new home.

那辆老旧的货车回火并发出嘈杂的咳嗽声，但不知怎的它并未熄火，在她意识到之前，她已经一路驶到了经过他们新家的大路上。

"Yeeehah!" She screamed. "Take that World! You haven't beaten me yet! Not by a long chalk!"

"耶哈！" 她尖叫道，"世界，你还没打败我！还差得远呢！"

She eased the van past the gate and turned it around to go back towards the cabin and out buildings. As she headed back up the drive she came to a frightening realisation.

她缓缓将货车驶过门口，掉头朝向小屋和附属建筑返回。当她沿着车道往回行驶时，突然意识到一件令人惊恐的事情。

"Oh fuck! Shinji!" The Third Child was nowhere to be seen. He slowed the van down and looked desperately left and right to see if she could see any sign of him. "Nothing… Nothing… Come on Baka! There!"

"哦，该死！真嗣！" 第三适格者不见踪影。他放慢了货车的速度，焦急地左右张望，希望能看到他的任何迹象。"什么都没有…什么都没有…拜托，笨蛋！那里！"

A patch of black in amongst the snow and rank weeds and thistles that grew stubbornly on the blighted land caught her attention. The van skidded to a halt and she pulled on the hand brake and leapt out. Sure enough, there was Shinji, face down in the weeds and snow just off the drive. Obviously he had parted company with the accelerating van as the engine has finally come to life and kind of stumbled blindly off the path and fallen amongst the scrub and brush that still clung to life there.

一片黑色在雪地、杂草和蓟丛中顽强生长的荒地上吸引了她的注意。货车急刹车停下，她拉起手刹，跳了出来。果然，是真嗣，脸朝下倒在车道旁的杂草和雪中。显然，当引擎终于启动，货车加速时，他与货车分离了，似乎是盲目地偏离了道路，跌入了那些依旧顽强生存的灌木丛中。

She quickly hauled him up onto his feet and surveyed him for damage. His black pants were torn and soaked through. His white shirt was filthy with mud and had several gaping rents in it. An angry bloody graze covered his left cheek and his hair was covered in dirt and snow.

她迅速将他拉起站稳，仔细检查他是否有损伤。他的黑色裤子已经撕裂并湿透，白色衬衫上满是泥污，还有几处大裂口。左脸颊上有一块血淋淋的擦伤，头发里满是泥土和雪。

"Jesus Shinji!" She said in amazement. "You look like crap!"

"耶稣真嗣！" 她惊讶地说，"你看起来糟透了！"

Shinji, as usual, said nothing.

一如既往，真嗣什么也没说。

She grabbed his hand and roughly pushed him into the passenger seat of the van. "You know, Third Child, this whole 'Strong Silent' thing is starting to get really old"

她抓住他的手，粗暴地将他推进了货车副驾驶座。“你知道吗，三娃子，这个‘强硬沉默’的把戏开始变得真的很过时了。”

She jumped into the other seat and drove the last hundred metres or so back to the cabin. Leaving the engine running in the hope of charging the van's battery she got Shinji out of the seat and took him back inside.

她跳进另一座位，驱车最后百余米返回小屋。为给货车电池充电，她让引擎继续运转，随后将真嗣从座位上抱出，带他回到屋内。

Even in the dim light from the windows he looked pretty beaten up. She sighed to herself as she realised that there was no way that she could leave him like this. He looked like he had gone three rounds with Zeruel and he was beginning to shiver violently in his wet clothes.

即使在窗户透进的昏暗光线中，他看起来也相当狼狈。她暗自叹息，意识到自己绝不能就这样丢下他不管。他那模样仿佛与泽鲁尔大战了三个回合，湿透的衣服下，他开始剧烈地颤抖。

"Oh, fuck no!" Asuka muttered as she realised what she was going to have to do. She scouted around for as many metal pots as she could fit onto the fire, filled them with the rusty water from the tank and placed them over the fire.

"哦，该死，绝对不行！" 明日香喃喃自语，意识到自己不得不做的事情。她四处搜寻，尽可能多地找到能放在火上的金属锅，从水箱里舀出锈水装满，然后架在火上。

Next, and most galling for her, she carefully stripped off Shinji's wet clothing. She made a real effort no to look at his body as she wrapped a thick blanket around him and set him to warm up in front of the fire.

接下来，对她来说最尴尬的是，她小心翼翼地脱掉了真嗣的湿衣服。在用厚毛毯将他裹好并安置在火前取暖时，她努力不去看他的身体。

He looked so pale and lost sitting huddled on the hearth. A part of her did felt pity for him. Wanted to hold him, comfort him from the pain she knew that he had endured. The mighty Third Child brought so low by a World made in his own image. She shook her head. No. She couldn't afford weaknesses like pity any more. She was Asuka Langley Soryu. She had survived where the rest of humanity had not. Pity and sorrow were not luxuries that she could afford to indulge in. After a little longer she went back outside and parked the van in the old shed. The battery should be charged enough by now, and anyway, no point in wasting precious petrol.

他蜷缩在壁炉旁，面色苍白，茫然若失。她内心的一部分确实对他产生了怜悯，想要拥抱他，安慰他，因为她知道他所承受的痛苦。强大的第三适格者，竟被一个按照自己形象创造的世界击垮至此。她摇了摇头。不，她不能再容许自己有任何软弱，如怜悯之情。她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，在人类未能幸存之地，她活了下来。怜悯与悲伤，已不是她能沉溺的奢侈。过了一会儿，她回到外面，将货车停进旧棚子里。电池现在应该充得差不多了，再说，也没有必要浪费宝贵的汽油。

She came back inside. Shinji still sat shivering on the floor in front of the fireplace.

她回到屋内，发现真嗣依旧坐在壁炉前的地板上，瑟瑟发抖。

"The invincible Third Child, huh?" She said mockingly at the mute boy. "Kind of pathetic really."

"无敌的第三子，是吧？" 她嘲讽地对那个哑巴男孩说。"真是挺可悲的。"

Eventually the water was hot enough to transfer to the old bathtub, she hadn't drained out the water from the previous night, so soon the tub was filled with rather cloudy looking warm water.

最终，水热到足以转移到旧浴缸里，她没有排掉前一晚的水，所以不久浴缸就装满了看起来相当浑浊的温水。

"Okay, Shinji, you're coming with me!" She said rolling up her sleeves and dragging the boy roughly from his spot in front of the fireplace and across to the bathroom.

"好了，真嗣，你跟我来！" 她一边说着，一边卷起袖子，粗鲁地将男孩从壁炉前的位置拽起，一路拖到浴室。

"I fucking cannot believe that I have to do this!" She stood there looking at him, still shivering and with only a blanket wrapped around him, she hesitated for a moment. "Okay Asuka, you can do this… Just make it quick… like a band-aid… "

"我真不敢相信我得这么做！"她站在那里看着他，他依旧颤抖着，身上只裹着一条毯子，她犹豫了一会儿。"好吧，明日香，你可以的…就像撕创可贴一样，快点搞定…"

She pulled the blanket from around him and threw it to the floor. Shinji just stood there, naked and shivering next to the steaming tub. She couldn't help but notice how skinny he looked, like he had been wasting away in the weeks before Impact. He too had livid scars covering his body, almost in a pattern, though she couldn't quite make it out in the light.

她从他身上扯下毯子，扔到地上。真嗣就那样赤裸着站在冒着热气的浴缸旁，浑身颤抖。她不禁注意到他看起来多么瘦弱，仿佛在冲击事件前的几周里日渐消瘦。他身上也布满了触目的疤痕，几乎呈现出某种图案，但在那样的光线下，她无法完全辨认出来。

"Jesus… I can't believe I'm standing here ogling your skinny ass!" She said and she nudged him towards the tub. He pretty much just fell into it with an enormous splash, spilling precious water on the floor and soaking her clothing through as well.

"天哪… 真不敢相信我站在这儿盯着你那瘦屁股！" 她说着，轻轻推他向浴缸走去。他几乎是跌进去的，溅起巨大的水花，不仅洒了一地珍贵的水，还把她的衣服也弄湿了。

"Fucking good one Ikari!"

真他妈棒，碇！

Setting her jaw determinedly she grabbed a washcloth and soap and gently began to wash the dirt and dried blood away from the wounds on his face and chest. She looked at his face, it was peaceful, if vacant. She had known him for almost a year and she didn't think that she had even seen his face so devoid of tension, fear or anxiety. She mopped some dry blood from his brow, smiling unconsciously to herself as his automatic reflex caused him to blink rapidly as the water dripped into his eyes.

她坚定地咬紧牙关，抓起一块洗布和肥皂，轻柔地开始清洗他脸上和胸前伤口周围的泥土和干涸血迹。她凝视着他的脸，那是一片宁静，尽管空洞无神。她认识他快一年了，却不记得曾见过他的面容如此松弛，没有一丝紧张、恐惧或焦虑。她从他的眉间拭去一些干血，当水滴落入他眼睛时，他本能地快速眨眼，她不由自主地微笑起来。

"Why the hell am I here, Shinji?" She said in almost a whisper. "Why did you chose me to come back? Of all of the people in the World, why me? Why bring me back to this World and then abandon me? Why Shinji….?"

"我到底为什么在这里，真嗣？" 她几乎是用耳语般的声音说道。"为什么你选择让我回来？在这个世界上所有的人中，为什么是我？为什么把我带回这个世界，然后又抛弃我？为什么，真嗣……？"

She wasn't expecting an answer, which was just as well, because she didn't get one.

她本就没期待答复，这样也好，因为她确实没得到任何回应。

She continued washing him, although she could bring herself to touch it she did feel herself blush as she carefully worked around his groin area. "Not much to look at…" she said with a teasing tone. "But I swear to you, Third Child, if that thing even moves or….or… anything I will kick you out into the snow and leave you there to freeze to death! You understand me?"

她继续为他清洗，尽管她能让自己触碰那里，但当她小心翼翼地在他腹股沟周围工作时，还是不禁脸红了。“没什么好看的……”她用戏谑的语气说道，“但我发誓，第三适格者，如果那东西动一下或者……或者……有任何动静，我就会把你踢到雪地里，让你在那里冻死！你明白我的意思吗？”

She laughed out loud to herself at the ridiculousness of her situation. "Thank God no one can see us here… " She said as she continued giggling.

她对自己处境的荒谬不禁放声大笑。“感谢上帝，这里没人能看到我们……”她边说边继续咯咯笑个不停。

Quickly, but gently, she finished cleaning him up. Then she got him out of the bath, wrapped the blanket back around him and took him back to the fireplace to dry off. While he sat there, she went back out to the small outbuilding and dragged the crate full of old clothing back to the cabin.

她迅速而轻柔地完成了对他的清洁工作。随后，她将他从浴缸中抱出，重新用毯子裹好，带回壁炉旁让他烘干。在他坐在那里的时候，她又返回小外屋，拖着装满旧衣物的箱子回到了小屋。

She noticed as she brought the crate back that the sun was already beginning to sink lower into the sky. She knew that she had slept in late, but surely it couldn't be sundown already? She remembered hearing that the days in Winter had been shorter than summer, but for all of her life the days had been long in the eternal summer of 2nd Impact. Maybe this was what things were supposed to be like. Perhaps the World was returning to its normal round of seasons and this cold Winter would give way to the warmth of Spring and Summer? She hoped so.

当她搬回板条箱时，注意到太阳已经开始向天际下沉。她知道自己睡过头了，但总不至于这么快就日落了吧？她记得听说过冬天的日子比夏天短，但在第二次冲击后的永恒夏日里，她的一生中日子总是漫长的。也许这才是事物应有的样子。或许世界正在恢复它正常的四季轮回，而这个寒冷的冬天将会让位于春天的温暖和夏日的炎热？她对此抱有希望。

Back inside she rugged Shinji up in some of the warmer looking clothes in the crate, and changed into some warmer clothes herself. By that time it was dark outside and the little house closed in again upon them.

回到屋内，她从箱子里挑出几件看起来较暖和的衣服给真嗣穿上，自己也换上了更厚的衣物。此时外面已是一片漆黑，小屋再次将他们紧紧包围。

Their meagre food supply would have to be rationed strictly if they were to continue surviving for any length of time, so she decided not to heat up anything for them. Tomorrow she would go out and try to find more supplies for them, but it was best to play it safe and not use too much all at once.

如果他们想要在任何一段时间内继续生存下去，就必须严格定量分配他们那点可怜的食物供应，因此她决定不为他们加热任何东西。明天她会出去尝试为他们找到更多的补给，但最好还是谨慎行事，不要一次性用掉太多。

They would just have to get used to hunger for now. "If you don't like it, Baka, feel free to complain… " No reply was forthcoming. "Thought so."

他们现在只能习惯饥饿了。“如果你不喜欢，笨蛋，尽管抱怨吧……”没有回应。“我就知道。”

Asuka was taken by surprise by an enormous yawn that felt like it completely overtook her. She tried to stretch her aching and stiff limbs and back. Her body felt heavy and sore from the exertions of the day, and although it only felt like she had been awake for a few hours at most, she was bone tired.

明日香被一个巨大的哈欠吓了一跳，感觉它完全占据了她的意识。她试图伸展疼痛而僵硬的四肢和背部。她的身体因一天的劳累而感到沉重和酸痛，尽管感觉上她最多只醒了几个小时，但她已是筋疲力尽。

She lay down on the bed and draped the quilt and a couple of blankets over them. Sleep took her quickly.

她躺在床上，用被子盖好，又加了几条毯子。很快，她就进入了梦乡。

In the flickering darkness Shinji's open eyes shimmered dully. The firelight dancing in the single tear that rolled down the side of his cheek and was lost in the crumpled bedclothes.

在摇曳的昏暗中，真嗣睁开的双眼黯淡地闪烁着。火光在沿着他脸颊滑落的一滴泪中跳跃，最终消失在皱巴巴的床单里。

The roadways closer to the ruins of Tokyo-3 were littered with rubble and debris, so Asuka had to leave the van behind. She had found the train tracks a convenient path around the city, but once off them the streets became impassable.

靠近东京-3 废墟的道路上散布着瓦砾和碎片，因此明日香不得不将货车留在后面。她发现沿着铁路轨道绕城而行颇为便捷，但一旦离开轨道，街道便变得无法通行。

So she had parked it at the nearest train station to the centre that still stood, thrown an old canvas rucksack on her back and the rifle over her right shoulder and had proceeded on foot into the remains of one of Humanity's greatest technical achievements. Shin Tokyo-3.

于是，她将车停在了离中心最近且仍屹立不倒的火车站旁，背上旧帆布背包，右肩挎着步枪，徒步走进了人类最伟大技术成就之一的废墟之中——新东京-3 号。

It felt a lot longer than two days ago that she had been here. Dirty and bedraggled, dressed only in a torn and damaged plug suit. Now she moved with purpose. Warm clothing insulating her still sore and aching body from the cold. Asuka felt reasonably confident that she could find something in the blasted city that would help them survive.

感觉上比两天前她在这里时漫长得多。那时她肮脏不堪，衣衫褴褛，仅穿着一件破损的插入栓服。如今，她行动有了目标。温暖的衣物保护着她那依旧疼痛、酸楚的身体，抵御着寒冷。明日香相当自信，她能在那片废墟城市中找到帮助他们生存下去的东西。

She had left Shinji back at the farm. He would be more of a liability, she felt, in her exploration of the City. He was still back at the cabin, lying on the futon next to the fire. A small tinge of resentment curled her lip. 'Fucking lazy Baka… Lying around while I do all of the work!' She didn't need him anyway. She would survive and keep their precious Shinji-kun alive until they all came crawling back out of the muck. Then they would see how much more worthy she was than they had ever treated her!

她将真嗣留在了农场。她觉得，在探索这座城市时，他会成为累赘。他仍留在小屋里，躺在火旁的蒲团上。一丝怨恨使她撇了撇嘴。'该死的懒蛋……我忙里忙外，他却躺着不动！'反正她也不需要他。她会活下去，并保护好他们珍贵的真嗣，直到他们从泥泞中爬回来。那时，他们就会看到她比他们一直以来所认为的更有价值！

'Fuck them all anyway! I don't need them, I'm doing fine all by myself!'

管他们呢！我不需要他们，我自己过得很好！

Once again she found herself walking past their old Apartment building. She didn't even spare it a glance. 'No point crying over the past. Time to make the future!' Even in her head it sounded like a corny old platitude.

她再次发现自己正经过他们曾经的公寓楼，甚至没有多看一眼。“为过去哭泣毫无意义，是时候创造未来了！”即便在心里，这也像是个陈腐的老生常谈。

Out here in the suburbs the City still seemed devoid of life. No birds sang or squawked, nothing moved but the various bits of debris and rubbish in the freezing wind. Asuka really did feel like she was the only living creature on the Earth.

在这郊外，城市依旧显得死气沉沉。没有鸟儿歌唱或鸣叫，除了在寒风中飘动的各种碎片和垃圾，没有任何东西在动。明日香真的感觉自己像是地球上唯一的生命。

A few snowflakes began to gently fall.

几片雪花开始轻轻飘落。

Further along the road there were several buildings that were still upright. Though the angles of many of their walls suggested that this wasn't necessarily a permanent arrangement. Despite this, a small glow of hope warmed her insides and tightened her throat. If she remembered rightly, Misato's favourite convenience store was in this group of buildings!

沿着道路再往前，有几栋建筑依旧屹立不倒。尽管许多墙壁的倾斜角度暗示着这并非长久之计。尽管如此，一丝希望的微光温暖了她的内心，使她的喉咙紧缩。如果她没记错的话，这里的一片建筑中就有美里最喜欢的便利店！

She scrambled over some more piles of rubble and sure enough, there was the entrance to the store, with its sign battered and lying on the ground near the entrance. She looked anxiously at the state of the building around it. It didn't look like it would collapse in the next 15 minutes or so. With a certain amount of apprehension she went inside.

她又翻过几堆瓦砾，果然，商店的入口就在那里，招牌破损不堪，躺在入口附近的地上。她焦急地环顾四周建筑的状况，看起来不像是会在接下来的 15 分钟内倒塌的样子。带着几分忐忑，她走了进去。

It was dark inside and even with the dim light outside it took her eyes a minute or so to adjust to the gloom. The smell was truly unpleasant. Several different kinds of… something… were rotting in the freezers and fridges of the store.

室内昏暗，即便外面有微弱的光线，她的眼睛还是花了大约一分钟才适应了这片阴暗。那气味实在令人不快。商店的冰柜和冰箱里有好几种不同的东西正在腐烂。

Asuka unslung the heavy rifle and took the rucksack off her back and placed the both on the dust covered counter. Feeling strangely ridiculous she took one of the shopping trolleys from the bay and wheeled it further into the store.

明日香解下沉重的步枪，卸下背上的背包，将两者放在布满灰尘的柜台上。她感到一种莫名的荒谬，便从货架旁取了一辆购物车，推着它更深入店内。

Ignoring the temptations of the rows of snack foods she made her way to the aisles of tinned food. She grimaced with every ready-meal and canned meat product she placed in the cart, but for the moment she felt that the more energy she could put into keeping them alive the better. If she could keep them both alive long enough for this winter to end perhaps she could even get some fresh food growing?

她无视了一排排零食的诱惑，径直走向罐头食品区。每将一份即食餐和罐头肉制品放入购物车时，她都皱起了眉头，但此刻她觉得，能投入更多精力让他们活下去总是好的。如果她能让他们撑过这个冬天，或许还能种些新鲜食物呢？

Quickly she had gathered enough to fill her rucksack. Being aware of her weakened condition and the fact that the van was probably two kilometres walk or so away she came back to the front counter and began to load up the rucksack with some of the goods she had found. Clipping it shut she put it on her back, grabbed the rifle and headed out of the store.

她迅速收集了足够的东西填满背包。意识到自己身体虚弱，且货车可能还有两公里左右的路程，她回到前台，开始将找到的物品装进背包。扣紧背包后，她背上它，抓起步枪，离开了商店。

In the short time that she had been inside the blizzard had set in. The wind had an even icier edge to it now and the snow flakes stung her eyes and face. It was all that she could do to muster up the energy to push her weary legs back towards the station where the van was parked.

在她进入暴风雪的短暂时间里，风雪已经肆虐起来。此刻的风更加刺骨，雪花刺痛了她的眼睛和脸庞。她所能做的就是鼓起力气，拖着疲惫的双腿，艰难地返回车站，那里停着她的面包车。

The silence of the City was freakishly eerie. Even her own laboured breathing and muffled footfalls seemed to be absorbed by the ruins around her. Their stricken outlines softened by the snow that now was beginning to blanket them. It would almost be beautiful if not for the knowledge of the violence that had rendered the World that way.

城市的寂静异常诡异。连她自己沉重的呼吸声和脚步声似乎都被周围的废墟吞噬了。那些受损的轮廓因新雪的覆盖而变得柔和。若非知晓世界曾遭受的暴力，这一切几乎可以称得上美丽。

Trudging past the old Apartment building without really noticing it and finally seeing the wreck of the station building come into view she breathed a sigh of relief.

她步履沉重地经过那栋老旧的公寓楼，并未真正留意，直到终于看到车站建筑的废墟映入眼帘，才松了一口气。

"Thank God!" She said out loud.

"谢天谢地！" 她大声说道。

As if in answer a distant wail sounded in the air. The blizzard around her made it difficult to tell from which direction it had come. But it was answered by another, louder wail from much closer to her. Panic clutched at her stomach and she quickened her pace towards the station as the air was filled with yet another wail, much more distant than the others. She only knew of one thing that made that forlorn and chilling sound. She had heard it often back in Germany as a child, especially when she had lived with her Grandmother just outside Regensburg. Wolves had been gaining in population in Central Europe since 2nd Impact, mostly because there were now less Humans to compete with them for land and food. But they had supposedly been extinct in Japan for over a century.

仿佛在回应一般，空气中传来一声遥远的哀嚎。她周围的暴风雪使得难以判断声音来自何方。但紧接着，更近处响起了一声更为响亮的哀嚎，回应了之前的那个。恐慌攫住了她的胃，她加快脚步朝车站走去，此时空气中又充满了另一声哀嚎，比之前的都要遥远。她只知道有一种生物能发出那种凄凉而令人心寒的声音。在德国的童年时期，她经常听到这种声音，尤其是和祖母一起住在雷根斯堡郊外的时候。自从第二次冲击以来，狼群在中欧的数量一直在增加，主要是因为与它们争夺土地和食物的人类减少了。但在日本，据说狼已经灭绝了一个多世纪。

She didn't bother questioning what or why they seemed to be here and now in Tokyo-3, she simply picked up her pace and tried to get to the van as quickly as her exhausted legs would carry her.

她没有费心去探究他们为何此刻出现在东京-3，只是加快了步伐，尽力用疲惫的双腿尽快赶到那辆货车旁。

Her breath burned in her ribs and her burdens seemed to become heavier with each step. Her simple gratitude when she finally reached the old van and slumped in the seat was heavenly. Her face burned with the cold and her ears ached horribly.

她的呼吸在肋骨间灼烧，每走一步，负担似乎都变得更重。当她终于到达那辆旧货车，瘫坐在座位上时，那份简单的感激之情宛如天堂。她的脸因寒冷而灼热，耳朵则痛得厉害。

The starter motor whined shrilly for a few tense moments before the engine coughed into life. She forced the old van into gear and headed carefully down the trackway. The tyres slipped and skidded on the icy concrete, but she managed to keep it under control.

启动马达尖锐地哀鸣了几秒钟，紧张的气氛弥漫，随后引擎终于启动。她费力地将老旧的货车挂上档，小心翼翼地沿着小路行驶。轮胎在冰冷的混凝土上打滑，但她设法保持了控制。

A few more stops later she had managed to get some better fitting cold weather gear from a derelict old Army Surplus store, including some boots that actually fit, some leather gloves, a scarf and a woollen hat, and what she felt was a very retro and stylish pair of old flying goggles. As well as small gas burner and bottle from the camping section. She was really starting to get into it when again that same distant wail floated eerily on the icy wind. She came back to reality as she realised that daylight was not going to last for too much longer. The last thing she needed was to be caught out trying to drive back to the farm in the dark with God knew what lurking in the shadows! She quickly finished loading up the van and turned towards home. Or what would be home from now on in.

又过了几个站点，她在一家废弃的旧军用剩余物资商店里找到了一些更合身的御寒装备，包括一双真正合脚的靴子、皮手套、围巾和羊毛帽，还有她觉得非常复古且时髦的一副旧飞行护目镜。此外，她还从露营区拿了一个小型燃气灶和气瓶。正当她开始真正投入其中时，那熟悉的遥远哀鸣再次在冰冷的风中诡异地飘荡。她回到现实，意识到白昼不会持续太久。她最不需要的就是在天黑后试图驾车返回农场，而上帝才知道阴影中潜伏着什么！她迅速装好货车，转身朝家的方向驶去。从今往后，那里将是她的家。

The snow was starting to really build up now. It was getting harder to differentiate between the railway tracks and the surrounding landscape in the blizzard. She managed to drive mostly in the lee of the sound barriers and stay clear of the worst of the piling snow, but it got harder as she had to leave the relative shelter of the rail line and drive through the shattered outskirts of Tokyo-3.

雪开始真正积起来了。在暴风雪中，越来越难以区分铁轨和周围的景色。她设法在隔音屏障的背风处行驶，避开积雪最严重的地方，但随着她不得不离开铁路线的相对庇护，驶过东京-3 破碎的郊区，情况变得更加艰难。

Eventually when she finally cleared the old city and was able to get onto on one of the less damaged trunk roads the going became easier and she was able to increase her speed a little. Though still being carefully as the going could become treacherous without much warning. But the light was beginning to fade fast and she had to turn the headlights on before to long to try and see better in the growing gloom.

最终，当她终于穿过旧城区，驶上一条受损较轻的主干道时，行驶变得轻松了些，她得以稍稍提速。尽管仍需小心翼翼，因为路况随时可能变得险恶，预警甚少。但天色迅速暗淡，不久她便不得不打开车灯，试图在渐浓的暮色中看得更清楚。

Suddenly a black shape seemed to materialise out of the blizzard and before she could react she felt a great Whump as the van struck something heavy on the front passenger side. She slammed her foot onto the brake but in the slippery conditions it skidded out of control and spun 180 degrees to end up facing in the opposite direction on the other side of the roadway.

突然，一个黑色身影仿佛从暴风雪中显现，未等她反应过来，便感到一阵巨大的撞击声，货车前乘客侧撞上了某个沉重物体。她猛踩刹车，但在湿滑的路面上，车辆失控打滑，旋转了 180 度，最终停在道路另一侧，车头朝向相反方向。

"Shit!" Asuka exclaimed feeling her lip where a small trickle of blood was starting to flow from where she had bitten it when she had struck… whatever it was. In the light of the remaining headlight of her van, about 20 metres away by the side of the road, a dark shape lay unmoving in the cone of light.

"该死！" 明日香惊呼道，她感觉到自己的嘴唇上有一小股血开始从她咬伤的地方流出，就在她击中……无论那是什么的时候。在她的货车仅剩的一个车灯的照明下，大约 20 米外的路边，一个黑色的身影静静地躺在光束之中。

Leaving the engine running and pulling her gloves and goggles on she grabbed the rifle out from behind the seat and opened the door. Sliding out of the van she stood for a moment just listening. A heavy panting groan was coming from the direction of the shape on the road. Apart from the rattle of the van's engine all else was silent.

让引擎继续运转，她戴上手套和护目镜，从座位后面抓起步枪，推开车门。她从货车里滑出来，站了一会儿，只是静静地听着。从路上那个身影的方向传来沉重的喘息声。除了货车引擎的咔嗒声，四周一片寂静。

Holding the old rifle defensively in front of her she slowly waked towards it. As she got closer she could see that it appeared to be a fairly young Sika deer. They had been numerous in the old Hakone area before Third Impact, though God only knew what it had survived on in this desolate landscape. She lifted the goggles up from her eyes and looked closely at it. It certainly wasn't the healthiest looking individual. She could just about count all of its ribs as its chest heaved. A bright splash of blood stained the snow near its mouth and its two front legs were splayed at unnatural angles. The deer continued to give soft groaning pants as it lay there.

她手持旧步枪，警惕地挡在身前，缓缓向它走去。随着距离的拉近，她看清那似乎是一只相当年轻的梅花鹿。在第三次冲击之前，旧箱根地区曾有许多这样的鹿，但天知道它在这荒凉之地是如何存活下来的。她将护目镜推至额头，仔细观察。这只鹿显然不是最健康的模样。随着胸膛的起伏，她几乎能数清它的每一根肋骨。鹿口附近的雪地上，一抹鲜红的血迹格外显眼，两条前腿以不自然的姿势张开。那鹿躺在那里，依旧发出微弱的呻吟声。

Asuka ran a hand down its neck. Its dark eyes looking at her as she stroked it. A genuine pity for this poor broken creature swelled inside her as she looked down on it.

明日香伸手抚摸它的颈项，它那深邃的眼睛望着她，随着她的抚摸而转动。望着这个可怜的破碎生灵，她心中涌起了真切的怜悯之情。

"I'm sorry, liebchen." She said to it tenderly. It lifted its head and looked at her. "I'm going to have to do this."

"对不起，亲爱的。" 她温柔地对它说。它抬起头，望着她。"我不得不这么做。"

The deer lay its head back down in the snow. Asuka could feel tears prickling in her eyes as she brought the muzzle of the rifle down to its head. Closing her eyes and trying to ignore the panting of the creature, she whispered. "Sorry…" and pulled the trigger.

鹿将头重新埋进雪中。明日香能感觉到泪水在眼眶中刺痛，她将步枪的枪口对准鹿头。闭上眼睛，尽力忽略那生物的喘息，她低声道：“对不起…”随即扣动了扳机。

The boom of the shot echoed around her. She opened her eyes again. The deer was dead. That was the way of things, she told herself. The strong survive and the weak do not. She ejected the spent cartridge and slung the rifle back over her shoulder. As much as the idea made her stomach turn, this deer could just represent survival to her and Shinji. She grabbed its legs and began to drag it back towards the van.

枪声的回响在她周围回荡。她再次睁开眼睛，那只鹿已经死了。她告诉自己，这就是世界的法则：强者生存，弱者消亡。她退出空弹壳，将步枪重新挎回肩上。尽管这个念头让她感到恶心，但这只鹿对她和真嗣来说，可能就意味着生存。她抓住鹿腿，开始拖着它向货车方向返回。

A low growl froze her blood and made her stop in her tracks. She dropped the deer and spun around.

一声低沉的咆哮让她血液凝固，脚步戛然而止。她丢下鹿，迅速转身。

Between her and the safety of the van stood three skinny grey wolves. As she stood there, her blood turning to ice in her veins, the largest of the three, a dark grey male with an unusually short tail, took two steps forward. His lips curled back from his enormous teeth as he snarled warningly at her.

在她与货车安全之间，站着三只瘦削的灰狼。当她站在那里，血液仿佛在血管中凝固，其中最大的一只，一只尾巴异常短的深灰色雄狼，向前迈了两步。它巨大的牙齿随着警告性的咆哮从唇间露出。

The whole of existence seemed to shrink to just her, the dead deer and the exposed teeth of the three wolves that stood blocking her way back to safety. She slowly unslung the rifle from her shoulder, never once breaking eye contact with the bob-tailed wolf. Her mind was racing. Should she try to shoot the leader? Or would that escalate things with the others? She didn't think that she could bring down all three before they would get to her. Maybe bluff would be enough to see them off?

整个存在似乎缩小到只剩下她、那只死鹿以及三只挡住她返回安全之路的狼露出的牙齿。她缓缓从肩上卸下步枪，始终未曾移开与那只短尾狼的对视。她的思绪飞速运转。应该尝试射杀领头的吗？还是那样会激怒其他狼？她不认为自己能在它们扑上来之前击倒全部三只。或许虚张声势足以让它们退却？

She yelled out and lunged suddenly at the wolves, who jumped back from her growling even louder. Curiously they didn't try to come at her. Asuka was confused by this. 'It's almost as if they are holding me here… ' Something warned of the danger before she even realised that it was on her. She ducked and threw her arm up just as the animal crashed into her. Four more wolves had circled around behind her while the first three had held her attention. While two of those had tried to drag the deer carcass away the others had leapt at her from behind.

她突然大叫一声，向狼群猛扑过去，狼群被她的咆哮吓得跳开，声音更加凶猛。奇怪的是，它们并没有试图攻击她。明日香对此感到困惑。'这简直就像它们在把我困在这里……' 某种预感在她意识到危险之前就发出了警告。她迅速低头并举起手臂，就在这时，一只动物猛地撞向她。原来，当她被前三只狼吸引注意力时，另外四只狼已经悄悄绕到她身后。其中两只试图拖走鹿的尸体，而其他狼则从背后向她扑来。

The impact of the animals striking her knocked her to the ground. Luckily her heavy woollen duffel coat had protected her arm from the sharp teeth that had latched onto her arm. But it wouldn't protect her for long as the other three wolves moved in for the kill.

动物撞击的冲击力将她击倒在地。幸运的是，她那件厚重的羊毛粗呢大衣保护了她的手臂，使其免受紧咬其上的尖牙伤害。但随着另外三只狼逼近准备猎杀，这件大衣的保护作用也不会长久。

Kicking out at them with her booted feet she managed to roll onto her back so that she could face the slavering jaws of her attackers. She could smell the stink of their hot breath and hear the snapping of their teeth just in front of her face. Her left arm felt like it was being crushed in the jaws of one of them. Grabbing the rifle in her free hand she swung it wildly, smashing it into the face of the wolf on her arm. It yelped and leapt back, blood oozing from its broken jaw. The others also backed off a little, letting her bring the weapon to bear.

她用穿着靴子的双脚猛踢，设法翻了个身，仰面朝天，直面攻击者那流着口水的大嘴。她能闻到它们热乎乎的臭气，听到牙齿在她脸前咔嚓作响。她的左臂感觉像被其中一只咬住，快要被压碎了。她用空着的手抓住步枪，疯狂地挥舞，猛击咬住她手臂的狼的脸。那狼痛得叫了一声，跳了回去，血从它碎裂的下巴渗出。其他狼也稍稍后退，让她有机会举枪瞄准。

Ka-Boom! 轰隆！

Another of the creatures dropped to the snow, blood staining the fur on its chest. Its five pack mates backed off warily while the sixth lay whining quietly with its mouth full of blood. They were now between her and the deer. It was what they had wanted all along she supposed. She was just in their way. On the plus side, nothing now stood between her and the van.

另一只生物倒在雪地上，胸前的毛皮被血迹染红。它的五个同伴警觉地后退，而第六只则静静地躺在那里，嘴里满是血，发出哀鸣。现在，它们横亘在她和那头鹿之间。她猜想，这正是它们一直想要的。她不过是挡了它们的路。好在，现在没有任何东西挡在她和货车之间了。

"Fine." She said to them wearily. "Take it, just leave me alone!"

"好吧。" 她疲惫地对他们说，"拿去吧，别再烦我了！"

As if they understood her they backed away from her. Working together they dragged the carcass of the deer off the road and into the darkness. Leaving their dead and injured brothers behind.

仿佛理解了她的意图，它们从她身边退开。齐心协力，它们将鹿的尸体拖离道路，隐入黑暗之中，留下那些死伤的同伴。

She watched them go in silence. Only the burble of the engine and the whining of the injured wolf breaking the quiet.

她静静地看着他们离去。唯有引擎的咕噜声和受伤狼的哀鸣打破了这份宁静。

Asuka could feel the shaking beginning in her legs and hands as the realisation of how close she had been to death began to sink into her brain. She shook her head. This was not the time to be losing it. She still had to get back, in the dark, to the little cabin where Shinji was waiting for her.

明日香能感觉到腿和手开始颤抖，意识到自己离死亡有多近的念头逐渐渗入脑海。她摇了摇头，现在不是崩溃的时候。她还得在黑暗中返回那个小屋，那里有真嗣在等她。

She turned to get into the van, but then she stopped. She turned back to where the two stricken wolves lay in the pool of light from the single working headlamp of her van. The first one was dead. The hole in its chest and stricken posture leaving no doubt as to that. The second one lay where it had finally collapsed a little further away. Its breath was faint and ragged and the fur around its mouth where she had hit it was matted with blood. It whined quietly as she approached it, but made no attempt to move.

她转身准备进入货车，却突然停下。她回头望向那两匹受伤的狼，它们躺在货车唯一亮着的车头灯投下的光圈中。第一匹已经死去，胸口的洞和那垂死的姿态无疑昭示了这一点。第二匹则躺在稍远一些的地方，那是它最终倒下的位置。它的呼吸微弱而急促，嘴边被她击中的毛发沾满了血迹，凌乱不堪。当她走近时，它轻声哀鸣，却未曾试图移动。

Asuka looked into its dark eye as she lowered the rifle to its head.

明日香将步枪对准它的头部，凝视着那只深邃的眼睛。

"Sorry…" She said as she pulled the trigger.

"对不起…" 她扣动扳机时说道。

Without looking back she walked to the waiting van and carefully turned it around and drove off, back towards her home.

她没有回头，径直走向等候的货车，小心翼翼地将其掉头，然后驱车离去，朝着家的方向驶去。

At least the blizzard had stopped.

至少暴风雪已经停了。

In the moonlight, even filtered by the constant cloud cover as it was, she could see the welcoming smoke coming from the brick chimney of the little cabin. Asuka felt weary to her very bones as she guided the old van into the cover of the bigger shed and climbed stiffly out of it.

在月光下，尽管被持续的云层遮挡，她仍能看见小木屋砖砌烟囱中升起的温馨炊烟。明日香感到全身疲惫至极，她将旧货车驶入更大的棚屋遮蔽下，然后僵硬地爬了出来。

She didn't bother unpacking the van. She didn't even bother making either of them a meal or bathing to get the blood and frozen sweat of the fight with the wolves off her after she got back inside.

她没有费心去整理货车里的东西。甚至没有费心为他们俩准备一顿饭，或者洗澡来洗掉与狼群搏斗后身上的血迹和冻住的汗水。

She threw a couple of logs onto the dwindling fire and stripped off her clothes down to just a T-shirt. Crawling under the covers of the futon next to where Shinji still lay she snuggled under the quilt and put her arms around the supine Third Child, drinking in the warmth of his body.

她往快要熄灭的火堆里扔了几根木头，然后脱掉衣服，只剩一件 T 恤。她爬进紧挨着仍在躺着的真嗣的蒲团被窝里，蜷缩在棉被下，双臂环抱着仰卧的第三适格者，尽情汲取他身体的温暖。

Finally allowing the tension of the day to overwhelm her she lay her head on his shoulder and wept like she hadn't since the day that Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu had left this Earth.

最终，她无法抵挡这一天的紧张情绪，将头靠在他的肩上，哭得仿佛自从那天绫波丽离开地球后就不曾有过。

She was beginning to realise that surviving Third Impact might just be the death of her.

她开始意识到，幸存于第三次冲击可能正是她的死亡之因。

End Chapter 2 第二章结束

Chapter 2 done. This initial part is taking more space than I had initially planned.

第二章完成。这部分的开头比我最初计划的占用更多空间。

I do have a reason for giving Asuka that particular rifle. I'm not a gun nut by any means. But the inspiration for this story came from an image that sprang into my mind of Asuka in a frozen wasteland. Duffel coat and goggles and holding a battered old SMLE rifle. It may seem a weird gun for 21st century Japan, but it also happens to tie in with a side story idea that I'm toying with. ^_^

我确实有理由给明日香那把特定的步枪。我绝非枪械迷。但这个故事的灵感源自一幅画面，它突然浮现在我脑海中：明日香身处冰封荒原，身着厚重的军大衣，戴着护目镜，手持一把破旧的李-恩菲尔德 SMLE 步枪。对于 21 世纪的日本来说，这把枪或许显得有些古怪，但它恰好与我在构思的一个支线故事想法相契合。^_^

Hopefully someone out there is enjoying reading this! Please review if you're reading. It provides a two-fold benefit of giving me encouragement to go on and some feedback about what you think about this little tale.

希望有人正在享受阅读这篇文章！如果您正在阅读，请留下评论。这不仅能给我继续前行的鼓励，还能提供您对这篇小故事的看法反馈，可谓一举两得。

God... I sound a bit needy there! :)

天啊...我听起来有点太需要关爱了！:)

## Chapter 3 Fimbulvetr 芬布尔之冬

Click….. BOOM! 点击….. 轰隆！

"Arrgh! Fucking hang-fire!" Asuka cursed as the shot went wide of its intended target. She quickly worked the bolt of the rifle, clearing the spent cartridge and ramming another one into the chamber.

"啊！该死的迟发火！" 明日香咒骂着，因为子弹偏离了预定目标。她迅速操作步枪的枪栓，清理掉用过的弹壳，并将另一颗子弹推入枪膛。

It was too late though. The scrawny deer was off and scampered over the next rise before she could manage to bring the gun to bear for a second shot.

然而为时已晚。那只瘦弱的鹿已经跑开，在能再次瞄准射击之前，它就窜过了下一个山丘。

"Fuck!" Asuka swore. She had been following the animal for most of that afternoon and this had been her best chance so far at bringing it down. She was bone weary and the western sky was beginning to turn the brilliant red colour that signified that darkness was not far away. She wiped a gloved hand across her face, a small trail of fresh blood stained it ."Fuck." She said again, but for a different reason. These unexplained nosebleeds were becoming all the more frequent. Asuka sighed wearily. In the scheme of things it wasn't important. Other problems pressed more urgently to the forefront of her mind. Like the fact that she couldn't afford to be out there when darkness fell.

"该死！"明日香咒骂道。她追踪这只动物几乎整个下午，这是目前为止她最好的机会。她疲惫不堪，西边的天空开始呈现出预示着夜幕即将降临的艳丽红色。她用戴着手套的手擦了擦脸，手套上留下了一道新鲜的血迹。"该死。"她再次说道，但这次是因为不同的原因。这些不明原因的鼻血越来越频繁。明日香疲惫地叹了口气。相比之下，这并不重要。其他问题更加紧迫地涌上心头。比如，她不能在天黑后还留在外面。

Darkness was when the wolves were at their most active and vigilant. She had learned from hard experience over the months that to be outdoors after dusk was to invite mortal danger in the form of animals that could see much better in the dark than she could ever hope to.

黑暗是狼群最为活跃和警觉的时刻。她通过数月来的艰难经历了解到，在黄昏后外出无异于招致致命危险，因为那些动物在黑暗中的视力远胜于她所期望的。

In the day time the pack was much quieter, and it if she ever encountered any of them during the lighter hours, they had learned to keep a respectful distance from her and her rifle. She was content with that arrangement.

白天时，狼群则安静许多，如果她在光亮时刻偶遇它们，它们已经学会与她和她手中的步枪保持尊重的距离。她对这种安排感到满意。

Live and let live, but never go outdoors without a loaded gun. That was what had kept her and Shinji alive for nearly a year now in the frozen wasteland that was post Third Impact Japan. That and her ability to hunt and scavenge them just enough food to avoid starving to death. But it had been a hard time, and it was going to get worse if nothing changed soon, she knew it.

活下去，也让别人活下去，但绝不要不带枪就出门。这就是她和真嗣在第三次冲击后的冰封日本荒原中存活近一年的秘诀。再加上她狩猎和搜寻食物的能力，勉强避免了饿死。但这段日子很艰难，如果情况不尽快改变，只会更糟，她心知肚明。

This Winter looked as if it was never going to end. There was so little forage to sustain the local herbivores that their populations had collapsed. Without them the creatures that relied upon them for their own sustenance struggled to survive. The rivalry for the few remaining prey animals was fierce. So far there had been just enough to keep Asuka and the local wolf population from coming into direct competition. But she knew that wouldn't last when the supply of deer ran out. When that happened… She wasn't sure what she would do.

这个冬天似乎永无止境。可供食用的植物稀少，导致当地食草动物数量锐减。没有了它们，依赖这些动物为生的生物也难以生存。对剩余猎物的争夺异常激烈。到目前为止，幸好有足够的猎物让明日香和当地的狼群避免了直接竞争。但她知道，一旦鹿群耗尽，这种情况就不会持续下去。到那时……她不确定自己该怎么办。

"Oh well, I'll burn that bridge when I get to it." She said fatalistically.

"唉，船到桥头自然直。" 她悲观地说。

She trudged through the snow covered track back to the main road taking her back to the cabin, her footsteps squeaking on the icy ground. She could make out the slight plume of smoke rising from the chimney. That was another worry. They were on the last of the scraps of wood and fuel that the area had to give, and going further afield to get more was going to be nigh on impossible. Especially since the van was no longer available after she had managed to roll it on the icy roads between here and Tokyo-3. It didn't really matter though, as there was only enough petrol left in the drums in the outbuildings for about quarter of a tank at most anyway.

她艰难地沿着积雪覆盖的小径返回主路，这条路将她带回小屋，她的脚步在冰冻的地面上发出吱吱声。她能隐约看到从烟囱升起的淡淡烟雾。这又是一个令人担忧的问题。他们已经用尽了该地区所能提供的最后一点木柴和燃料，而要到更远的地方去获取更多几乎是不可能的。尤其是在她设法在通往东京-3 的冰路上翻车后，货车也不再可用。不过，这也没什么大不了的，因为外屋里剩下的汽油最多也只能装满四分之一油箱。

By the time she got back to the cabin the sky was completely black with just the pale ghosts of swift moving high altitude clouds masking the pale early evening stars. She shook the snow off her boots and went inside.

当她回到小屋时，天空已完全漆黑，只有快速移动的高空云层那苍白的幽灵般身影，遮掩了初晚星辰的微弱光芒。她抖落靴子上的雪，走了进去。

"Tadaima!" She called as she came in. Still, despite all of this time without one, hoping for some kind of answer. None, of course, ever came.

"我回来了！" 她进门时喊道。尽管这么长时间没有回应，她仍心存期待，希望能得到某种答案。当然，答案从未到来。

She leaned the rifle against the wall took and off her gloves and coat. Then she lit a small hurricane lantern and carried it with her into the main room. "Did you miss me? Or are you pissed off that I didn't take you along with me this time?" Shinji remained seated in front of the fire where she had left him and gave no sign that he was even aware of her.

她将步枪靠在墙上，脱下手套和大衣。随后，她点燃了一盏小型的防风灯，提着它走进了主屋。“想我了吗？还是因为我这次没带你一起去而生气了？”真嗣依旧坐在她离开时的火堆前，没有任何迹象表明他意识到了她的存在。

She put some more wood on the fire from the pile she kept next to it. Most of the wood was from the demolition of the now empty outbuilding that had stored their original firewood. Even that source was getting very low.

她从旁边堆放的木柴中又添了一些到火里。这些木柴大多来自现已空置的附属建筑的拆除，那里曾存放着他们最初的柴火。即便如此，这个来源也快要枯竭了。

She went into the bathroom and started another fire in the small metal tray that she had placed underneath the large cast iron bath. She filled the bath up with snow every few days so that she could warm it up in this way, so as to wash the grime, dirt and freeze dried sweat off of their bodies. It was really the only luxury they had anymore, and after hours of fruitless hunting she felt the need for a little luxury.

她走进浴室，在那个放在大铸铁浴缸下的小金属托盘里又点燃了一团火。每隔几天，她就会用雪填满浴缸，以便用这种方式加热，从而洗去他们身上的污垢、泥土和冻干的汗水。这真的是他们现在仅剩的奢侈享受了，经过数小时的徒劳狩猎后，她感到需要一点这样的奢侈。

She went back out to the main room. "Sorry Shinji. No food today!" She said with false cheeriness. "I think I need to go back into Tokyo-3 tomorrow. We need to stock up on more instant crap if we want to keep up this modern lifestyle! You wanna come?" She waited a moment. "Fine then! Ill do it by myself!" She said in mock indignation. "Typical! Leave a woman to do all of the work while you sit on your bony ass and do nothing! You think that you're the last man on Earth or something?" Shinji, of course, gave no reply to her taunting. Asuka did it anyway because she needed to talk to someone or she'd go fucking insane! Shinji was actually, as far as she could tell, the last man on Earth. She was the last woman. "Oh boy, the Human race is truly screwed!" She muttered to herself.

她回到主房间，带着假装的欢快说：“对不起，真嗣，今天没吃的了！我想我明天得回东京-3 一趟，我们得补充更多速食垃圾，才能维持这种现代生活！你想一起来吗？”她等了一会儿，“好吧，那我自己去！”她装作愤慨地说，“真典型！让女人干所有活，你却坐在那瘦骨嶙峋的屁股上什么都不做！你以为你是地球上最后一个男人还是怎么的？”当然，真嗣对她的挑衅没有回应。明日香这么做是因为她需要和人说话，否则她会疯掉的！实际上，据她所知，真嗣确实是地球上最后一个男人，而她是最后一个女人。“哎呀，人类真是完蛋了！”她自言自语道。

She had, in some of her more desperate moments, considered using him. That maybe as the last human female it was her duty to try, however futilely, to continue the species. Become the new Eve and all of that crap. But she couldn't. There was no way she could use him like that. There was a very nasty word for what that was. It would be far worse than what he had done to her in the Hospital, at least in her own mind.

在她最为绝望的时刻，她曾考虑过利用他。或许作为最后一位人类女性，她有责任尝试，尽管徒劳无功，也要延续种族。成为新的夏娃，诸如此类的荒谬想法。但她做不到。她无法那样利用他。这种行为有一个非常恶毒的称呼。这比他在医院对她所做的还要恶劣，至少在她自己看来是这样。

The mere thought of becoming one with him while he just lay there staring into space with those lifeless eyes of his made her flesh crawl. She still shuddered though at the thought of how much some deep primeval part of her still had wanted her to do it.

仅仅想到与他合为一体，而他只是躺在那里，用那双无神的眼睛凝视着虚空，就让她感到毛骨悚然。尽管如此，一想到她内心深处某个原始的部分仍然多么渴望她这么做，她仍然不寒而栗。

She went back into the bathroom and felt the water. It was just about the right temperature. She smothered the small fire under the tub with an old blanket and went back into the main room again. "Come on Shinji! Bath time!" She said to him as she began to strip her own clothing off. Pulling the long shirt up over her head and finally kicking off her shoes and socks she lowered the heavy cargo pants to the floor and stood completely nude in the firelight. It still amazed her how unfazed she was these days at being naked in front of him. The first couple of times had been to weird for words, but now she didn't even give it a second thought most of the time.

她回到浴室，试了试水温，正合适。她用一条旧毯子扑灭了浴缸下的小火，再次回到主屋。“快来，真嗣！洗澡时间到了！”她一边对他说，一边开始脱下自己的衣服。她将长衫拉过头顶，最后踢掉鞋子和袜子，把厚重的工装裤褪到地上，赤身裸体地站在火光中。她仍然惊讶于自己如今在他面前裸露时竟如此泰然自若。最初几次尴尬得难以言表，但现在大多数时候她甚至不再多想。

Once she was disrobed she then turned her attention to him. Dragging him to his feet she quickly and efficiently pulled the sweater up over his head, exposing his pale body with his ribs now protruding under his skin. Then she removed his socks and long pants so that he was now as naked as she was.

她脱去衣物后，便将注意力转向了他。她迅速而高效地将他拉起，把毛衣从他头上拽下，露出他那苍白、肋骨在皮肤下凸起的身体。接着，她又脱掉了他的袜子和长裤，使他变得和她一样赤裸。

She took his hand in hers and led him to the bathroom. Gently she guided him into the warm bathwater and once he was settled she hopped in and sat herself neck deep in the heavenly warm water at the other end of the bath to him

她握住他的手，领他走进浴室。轻柔地，她引导他进入温暖的浴水中，待他安顿好后，她轻盈地跳入浴缸，坐在与他相对的另一端，让自己沉浸在那如天堂般温暖的水中，直至颈部。

"Ahhh." She sighed. "That's more like it." She just let herself soak in the delicious warmth and safety of it all for a few blissful minutes. She ignored the growling protests of her stomach for the moment and just sitting with her eyes closed as the warmth of the water eased the pain in her aching joints for the first time in days.

"啊……"她叹了口气，"这才像话嘛。"她让自己沉浸在这份温暖与安全带来的愉悦中，享受了几分钟的幸福时光。暂时忽略了肚子的咕咕抗议，她闭上眼睛坐着，任由水中的暖意舒缓着多日来疼痛的关节。

After all too short a time she began to feel the water cooling off a bit. She opened her eyes and quickly got to work. Lathering them both up with a misshapen cake of soap she set to getting them both as clean as was possible in that rusty old bath. Then, before the last of the warmth left the water, she got the both of them out of the bath. She quickly wrapped one dirty towel around herself and dried Shinji off and dressed him in a long flannel shirt for sleeping in. She positioned him back on the futon in the main room before drying herself off back in the bathroom.

经过短暂的时间后，她开始感觉到水温有些下降。她睁开眼睛，迅速开始行动。用一块形状不规则的肥皂给两人涂上泡沫，尽力在那生锈的老浴缸里把他们都清洗干净。随后，在水温完全变冷之前，她把两人都从浴缸里拉了出来。她迅速用一条脏毛巾裹住自己，擦干真嗣，并给他穿上一件长法兰绒衬衫准备睡觉。她将他安置在主房间的蒲团上，然后回到浴室里把自己擦干。

As much as she tried to avoid it she was drawn to look at the girl in the bathroom mirror again. She noted the prominent cheekbones accentuated by her sunken cheeks, wild hair and bright, red rimmed eyes in the candlelight. She raised a hand to her face, opened her mouth and felt the spongy tender redness of her gums.

尽管她极力避免，却还是忍不住再次望向浴室镜中的女孩。她注意到那突出的颧骨因凹陷的双颊而更显眼，狂野的头发和烛光下亮晶晶、红彤彤的眼眶。她举起手触摸自己的脸，张开嘴，感受到牙龈那柔软而鲜红的触感。

"Shit." She swore as she noticed yet another tooth becoming loose under the gentle pressure of her fingers. She couldn't afford to lose another one!

"该死。" 她咒骂着，注意到又有一颗牙齿在手指轻压下开始松动。她可承受不起再失去一颗了！

The scars on her body had faded a little over time, but they still ached almost constantly. Her skin seemed to look as though it was stretched tautly across her bones these days. The still livid marks of her scars pockmarked her pale flesh. Her protruding ribcage sticking out from her chest and beneath her breasts and prominent hip bones made her look like some kind of standing corpse to her own eyes. Both her and Shinji were painfully skinny and probably, she admitted to herself, completely malnourished.

她身上的伤痕随着时间的流逝而略显淡化，但疼痛依旧几乎无时无刻不在。如今，她的皮肤仿佛紧绷在骨骼之上，那些依旧青紫的疤痕在她苍白的肌肤上星罗棋布。突出的肋骨从胸前、乳房下以及明显的髋骨处凸显，让她在自己眼中宛如一具站立的尸体。她和真嗣都瘦得令人心疼，她不得不承认，两人可能都严重营养不良。

The cold air was beginning to make her shiver, so she pulled on a long shirt and went out to the main room. Unashamedly she snuggled up to the prone form of Shinji as he lay on the futon in the dim firelight.

冷空气开始让她颤抖，于是她穿上一件长衫，走到主屋。在昏暗的火光中，她毫不羞涩地依偎在躺在蒲团上的真嗣身边。

"Tomorrow…" She murmured to him groggily as sleep began to take her. "Tomorrow I'll go into Tokyo-3. I get us some proper food… Then we'll be okay… Tomorrow…" She was still saying even as she fell into a deep, but troubled sleep.

"明天……" 她昏昏沉沉地对他低语，睡意开始袭来。"明天我会去东京-3。我会给我们弄些像样的食物……然后我们就没事了……明天……" 她甚至在陷入深沉却不安的睡眠时还在说着。

"Come on, give me a fucking break!"

得了吧，给我个喘息的机会吧！

Asuka's frustration levels were almost overpowering her weariness. She had spent most of the 'morning' so far hiking the frozen miles to Tokyo-3. It had been before the grey light of dawn had crawled sluggishly over the horizon when she had rolled out from where she had awoken, arms and legs entwined as usual with those of the catatonic Third Child.

明日香的挫败感几乎要压倒她的疲惫。她已经花了大半个'早晨'徒步穿越冰封的数英里路程前往第三新东京市。在灰蒙蒙的黎明缓缓爬过地平线之前，她就已经从醒来时与第三适格者如常缠绕在一起的胳膊和腿中挣脱出来。

She had made them both a breakfast of sorts from the last of the dried instant noodles and melted rusty snow-water that were left in the cabin. It didn't matter. If she didn't find food this time, hey were dead anyway. After this meagre breakfast she had placed Shinji back on the futon and piled just about every blanket they had on top of him. She had then dressed in her worn old duffel coat and warmest clothing. Stocking the rucksack with all of the stripper clips and ammunition she had Asuka grabbed the rifle and headed for the door.

她用小屋里最后一点干方便面和融化的生锈雪水，勉强为两人准备了早餐。这无关紧要，如果这次找不到食物，他们反正也活不成了。用过这顿简陋的早餐后，她将真嗣放回蒲团上，并给他盖上了几乎所有的毯子。随后，她穿上那件破旧的厚呢短大衣和最暖和的衣服，将所有弹夹和子弹装进背包，阿苏卡抓起步枪，向门口走去。

"Sorry, Baka-Shinji." She had said to him as she left. "I can't take you with me this time! You'd only slow me down, like… like you always do… " She remembered that she had felt a certain reluctance to leave him there. Almost like she would never see him again. Forcing herself into action she had walked through the front door, closing securely behind her, and out into the frigid darkness. "Baka…. " She said in an almost whisper. Even she wasn't too sure whom she had meant.

"对不起，笨蛋真嗣。" 她离开时对他说道，"这次我不能带你一起走！你只会像往常一样拖慢我的脚步……" 她记得自己离开他时有种莫名的不舍，几乎像是再也见不到他似的。她强迫自己行动起来，穿过前门，门在她身后紧紧关闭，走进了寒冷的黑暗中。"笨蛋……" 她几乎是用耳语般的声音说道。连她自己也不太确定这话是对谁说的。

Hitching the ropes of the crude, home made, sled over her shoulder she had begun the long lonely walk to the ruined city.

她将那粗糙的自制雪橇的绳索搭在肩上，开始了前往废墟城市的漫长孤独之旅。

Dawn had finally come, though it had only brought a sombre illumination to the shattered landscape around her. She paid it no attention as she marched, head down and breathing hard, along the long icy road to Tokyo-3.

黎明终于来临，尽管它只为她周围破碎的景象带来了一抹阴郁的光亮。她并未在意，只是低着头，艰难地呼吸着，沿着通往东京-3 的漫长冰路前行。

Once she had reached the City things hadn't improved for her.

当她抵达城市后，情况并未有所改善。

She had, in the early days of her time in the post Third Impact wasteland, stuck to raiding the few intact markets and convenience stores for food. She had avoided the few intact dwellings because they still had some resonance of their former occupants for her. Going into peoples homes felt like burglary. Like she was trampling someone's gravesite or something.

在第三次冲击后的荒芜之地初期，她一直靠洗劫少数完好的市场和便利店来获取食物。她避开了那些尚存的住宅，因为它们对她来说仍带有前居住者的余韵。闯入别人的家感觉就像入室盗窃，仿佛是在践踏某人的墓地或类似的东西。

Hunger and necessity had finally, many months ago, forced her to break her way into those homes and take what she could of the meagre pickings they offered.

饥饿与必需最终在数月前迫使她破门而入那些房屋，从中取走所能得到的微薄物资。

Now even those few sources of sustenance were drying up. She had plundered her way through nearly every building that was left in any way upright. Even though most of them felt like they would collapse around her ears at any moment. Eventually she had worked her way to the hill overlooking the city. This was the same hill that the remains of Tokyo-3 Middle School were perched.

如今，就连这些仅存的补给来源也日渐枯竭。她几乎洗劫了所有还勉强立着的建筑，尽管大多数感觉随时都会在她耳边崩塌。最终，她来到了俯瞰城市的山丘上，那里正是东京-3 中学遗迹所在之处。

The houses around the school were mostly smashed and obliterated as the multiple N2 strikes had hit the city, but the school had been protected by its imposing stone retaining wall and more solid concrete construction. Several of its buildings were no more than skeletal remains but the body of the main building still stood a kind of sepulchral watch over Tokyo-3.

学校周围的房屋大多在多次 N2 袭击中被摧毁殆尽，但学校因其雄伟的石砌挡土墙和更坚固的混凝土结构而得以幸免。几栋建筑仅剩骨架，但主楼的主体依旧屹立，仿佛在为东京-3 进行着一种阴森的守望。

Asuka had mostly avoided it until this time. Too many raw and painful memories were entombed in there.

明日香直到此刻大多都避开了它。那里埋藏着太多原始而痛苦的记忆。

This time need had pushed her beyond her misgivings. She pulled the sled wearily through the school gate. The rusted ironwork hanging awkwardly off its hinges. She had some small hope that the school cafeteria's store room might just contain some of the awful, powdered and pre-packaged so called 'food' that it had regularly doled out to its poor unfortunate and long departed students.

这一次，需求迫使她超越了疑虑。她疲惫地拖着雪橇穿过校门，那扇生锈的铁门歪歪斜斜地挂在铰链上。她怀揣着一丝微弱的希望，期待学校食堂的储藏室里或许还存有一些曾经定期分发给那些不幸且早已离去的学生的糟糕粉末和预包装的所谓“食物”。

She allowed herself a wry half smile. She had never had to lower herself to actually eat at the school cafeteria. Shinji had always prepared a fresh home made bento for her every school morning. A bento which she usually complained about and criticised. Though that had never stopped her from eating them. At the time she had felt that her position as Top Ranking Evangelion Pilot had entitled her to no less.

她自嘲地半笑了一下。她从未屈尊真正在学校食堂用餐。每个上学日的早晨，真嗣总是为她准备新鲜的自制便当。尽管她常常对此抱怨和批评，但这从未阻止她吃掉它们。那时，她觉得作为顶尖的 EVA 驾驶员，这是她应得的待遇。

What she wouldn't have done for one of those Bentos now…

她此刻多么希望能得到那些便当中的一个啊……

Casting such futile thoughts aside she undid the rope binding her to the sled. Thus far she hadn't actually needed it. There was just no food of any sort to be found in almost the entire Tokyo-3 area. She had dragged that heavy thing all over this side of the city, and had virtually nothing to show for it.

她将这些无用的思绪抛诸脑后，解开了绑在雪橇上的绳索。到目前为止，她其实并不需要它。几乎整个东京-3 地区都找不到任何食物。她拖着那个沉重的家伙走遍了这座城市的这一边，却几乎一无所获。

Asuka held the rifle defensively in front of her body and for the first time since the 15th Angel had laid her mind and soul bare, she went back into the Tokyo-3 Middle School.

明日香手持步枪，防御性地挡在身前，自第 15 使徒将她的心灵与灵魂暴露无遗后，她首次重返第三新东京市中学。

Walking down those familiar corridors was an eerily surreal experience. A school devoid of students was a strangely sad and barren place to be. A school in a dead City on a dead World exponentially so.

走在那些熟悉的走廊上，是一种诡异的超现实体验。一所没有学生的学校，是一个异常凄凉和荒芜的地方。在一座死城中的学校，在一个死寂的世界里更是如此。

Her booted feet crunched on the broken glass that seemed to cover every square centimetre of the floor. Doors and upturned lockers were scattered across her way also. As she tread carefully along the hallways she noticed that every here and there dark, reddish brown, stains were spattered on the walls. Some of them even having run down the and collected in now dried pools on the filthy floor. She had seen the same pattern of staining on a much larger scale during some of her battles in Unit 02.

她穿着靴子的双脚踩在似乎覆盖了地板每一平方厘米的碎玻璃上，发出嘎吱声。门和翻倒的储物柜也散落一地。她小心翼翼地沿着走廊前行，注意到墙壁上到处都是深红棕色的污渍。有些甚至已经流淌下来，在肮脏的地板上形成了干涸的水洼。她曾在 02 号单位的某些战斗中，见过这种大规模的污渍模式。

She didn't doubt that it was dried blood she could see. There had been similar signs of carnage in several of the stores and ruined houses she had raided over her months in this wasteland.

她毫不怀疑自己看到的是干涸的血迹。在过去的几个月里，她在这片荒原上洗劫的多家店铺和废墟中，都曾出现过类似的屠戮痕迹。

Without even really thinking about it where she was going , she came to the door of Class 2-A. Its sliding door was strangely intact.

她甚至没有真正思考要去哪里，就来到了 2-A 班的门前。那扇滑动门出奇地完好无损。

With a sense of something almost bordering on dread she slid the nondescript grey door open. In her mind's eye she was still expecting to see the classroom full of all of those familiar faces. Hikari, Toji, that dweeb Aida. Even the Honour Student Ayanami, staring as usual out of the window and yet always achieving top marks in every exam and assignment. 'The little mutant freak!' Even the old fossil of a Sensei would have been a welcome sight, droning on at the front of the class about how tough life had been after Second Impact.

她带着一种近乎恐惧的感觉，推开了那扇不起眼的灰色门。在她的脑海中，她仍然期待着看到那间教室里坐满了所有熟悉的面孔。光、东治、那个笨蛋相田。甚至是优等生绫波，一如既往地凝视着窗外，却总能每次考试和作业都取得最高分。'那个小怪胎！'就连那位老古董老师也会是一个受欢迎的景象，在教室前喋喋不休地讲述第二次冲击后生活的艰辛。

'Hmph. He should try living after Third Impact!' Asuka thought bitterly.

'哼，他应该试试第三次冲击后的生活！' 明日香苦涩地想。

It was with a genuine sense of disappointment that she saw that the old classroom was as derelict as all of the others she had passed in the school. All of the windows were smashed and broken. Several of the desks were overturned and some had been pushed over towards the other side of the room by a great force of some kind. Her own desk was jammed up against Shinji's. Without really thinking about why she was doing it she set it back on its legs and straightened it up and brushed some of the dust off the top of it.

当她发现那间旧教室和学校里其他她经过的教室一样荒废时，她感到一种真切的失望。所有的窗户都破碎不堪，几张桌子被掀翻，有些还被某种巨大的力量推到了房间的另一边。她自己的桌子紧贴着真嗣的。她并没有多想为什么要这么做，便将其扶正，摆正位置，并掸去了桌面上的一些灰尘。

It was then that a primal kind of anger swelled inside her chest. 'What the fuck am I doing here?' Her inner voice screamed. 'What was the God-damned point of coming back in here and straightening a fucking desk like it would somehow bring back the miserable time of the life that I fucking hated, and lost? Am I losing my fucking mind?"

就在那时，一种原始的愤怒在她胸中涌起。'我他妈在这里干什么？'她内心的声音尖叫着。'回到这里，整理一张该死的桌子，到底有什么狗屁意义？难道这样就能找回我痛恨且已失去的那段悲惨生活吗？我是不是疯了？'

She raised the rifle over her head and smashed the brass shoulder plate of into the top of her old desk. The cheap laminated particle board splintered and cracked under the blow. Three more strikes and it had shattered completely. She kicked at the stricken desk and sent it skittering across the room. A plastic chair followed it shortly after. Hikari's desk suffered a similar, violent end. Now brandishing the rifle like a club she spun around to assault Shinji's desk. Before she could strike the killer blow to the offending piece of furniture something brought her up short.

她将步枪高举过头，猛击向老桌子的黄铜肩板。廉价的层压刨花板在重击下碎裂开裂。再三击打后，桌子彻底粉碎。她一脚踢向受损的桌子，使其滑过房间。紧接着，一把塑料椅子也被抛出。光（Hikari）的桌子同样遭受了暴力的终结。此刻，她挥舞着步枪如同棍棒，转身冲向真嗣（Shinji）的桌子，正要给予那惹人生厌的家具致命一击时，某物突然让她停下了动作。

She stood there, panting from the sudden exertion, but standing frozen in time as she looked down at it. Carved, no more like hacked actually, into the top of Shinji's desk in a very familiar scrawl was:

她站在那里，因突如其来的用力而喘息，但时间仿佛凝固，她低头凝视着。在真嗣桌面上，以一种极为熟悉的潦草笔迹，与其说是雕刻，不如说是粗暴地刻着：

"あんたバカ?" "你傻吗？"

She remembered clearly scratching that into his desk with a compass during morning recess in the early days of her time in Tokyo-3. She also remembered that the idiot had seemed to be almost pleased with it when he saw her doing it. The image of his ridiculous smiling face appeared in her mind. The moron was so starved of attention that being insulted by her was enough to make him happy? He really was pathetic.

她清晰地记得，在东京-3 早期的某个上午课间休息时，她用圆规在他的课桌上刻下了那句话。她还记起，那个白痴看到她在刻字时，似乎还挺高兴的。他那可笑的笑脸浮现在她脑海中。这个蠢货是如此渴望关注，以至于被她侮辱都能让他开心？他真是可悲至极。

The rifle clattered unnoticed to the floor. Asuka's vision seemed to be getting blurry all of a sudden. She sniffed and wiped her gloved hand across her eyes and was shocked to see traces of moisture on the back of it.

步枪悄然无声地落在地板上，无人察觉。明日香的视线突然变得模糊起来。她吸了吸鼻子，用戴着手套的手抹过眼睛，惊讶地发现手套背面竟留下了湿润的痕迹。

"Oh great, now I'm crying? I must be losing my fucking mind!"

哦，太好了，现在我居然哭了？我他妈的肯定是疯了！

Asuka sniffed again, but then retched as the familiar sickly feeling of blood hitting the back of her throat triggered her gag reflex. She screwed up her face and spat out as much as she could of the blood. Grabbing a dirty rag off the teachers desk she held it up to her nose, trying not to be alarmed as it swiftly turned red from the flow from her nostrils as she tilted her head forward.

明日香再次嗅了嗅，但随即因熟悉的血腥味冲上喉咙而引发呕吐反射。她皱起脸，尽可能吐出血液。从老师的桌子上抓起一块脏布，她将其捂在鼻子上，当她前倾头部时，布迅速被鼻血染红，她努力保持镇定。

These constant nose-bleeds were becoming a real pain in the ass.

这些频繁的流鼻血真是让人烦透了。

It took nearly ten minutes before the flow finally stopped. 'Well, I've wasted enough time in here…' She thought to herself in an attempt to urge herself on. "Ikuhayo, Asuka!" She said aloud as she tossed the blood soaked rag onto the floor and picked up the rifle. She exited Classroom 2-A and headed towards the school's cafeteria.

过了将近十分钟，血流才终于止住。'唉，我已经在这里浪费太多时间了……' 她暗自思忖，试图激励自己。"走吧，明日香！" 她大声说道，将沾满血迹的抹布扔到地上，拿起步枪。她离开了 2-A 教室，朝着学校的食堂走去。

xxxxxxxxx 源文本：xxxxxxxxx 翻译文本：

"Six tins of powdered eggs. A crate of tinned frankfurters and a catering sized can of instant coffee! No wonder I never ate at this shit-hole!" Asuka griped as she loaded the meagre bounty from the school's larder onto the sled. It seemed most of the non tinned foods had quickly been claimed by the rodent population in the early days after Third Impact. All of the rice and freeze dried food in plastic packaging had been plundered long ago. Leaving just these measly offerings for the German girl to show for her trouble.

"六罐蛋粉，一箱罐装法兰克福香肠，还有一大罐速溶咖啡！难怪我从没在这破地方吃过饭！" 明日香一边抱怨，一边将学校储藏室里那点可怜的收获装上雪橇。看来，第三次冲击后不久，大部分非罐装食品很快就被啮齿类动物占领了。所有塑料包装的大米和冻干食品早已被洗劫一空。留给这位德国女孩的，只有这些微不足道的供品，以示她的辛劳。

"Oh well, it's better that nothing I suppose…" She said as she looked up a the sky.

“唉，我想总比什么都没有好吧……”她抬头望着天空说道。

Through the cloud cover she could see that sun was already past its zenith in the sky and had started to make its way down to the western mountains. She figured at best she had a couple of hours of daylight left. She had wasted far too much time at that school discovering that memory lane could be a dark and lonely alleyway. She knew that she had to get her ass into gear if she wanted to get home before darkness fell.

透过云层，她看到太阳已越过天顶，正向西边的山脉缓缓下沉。她估摸着，最多还有几个小时的日光。在那所学校里，她浪费了太多时间，发现回忆之路竟是一条黑暗而孤寂的小巷。她明白，要想在天黑前到家，就必须振作起来。

Bracing herself against the growing wind she reattached the sled's rope and turned her back on the ruins of Tokyo-3 Middle School for what would be the last time.

她顶着越来越大的风，重新系好雪橇的绳索，最后一次背对东京-3 中学的废墟。

The wind had grown even more frigid by the time she had cleared the ruins of Tokyo-3. Dark clouds had gathered over the mountains and begun slowly creeping and swelling to cover the entire sky. Asuka shivered despite her many layers of warm clothing. She was still too far away from home and thanks to the gathering clouds darkness was falling earlier than she had expected. To make things worse small flurries of snowflakes were beginning to fall around her.

当她清理完东京-3 的废墟时，风变得更加刺骨。乌云在山脉上空聚集，并开始缓慢蔓延，膨胀，遮蔽整个天空。尽管穿着多层保暖衣物，明日香还是不由自主地打了个寒颤。她离家还很远，而由于云层的聚集，夜幕比她预料的更早降临。更糟糕的是，周围开始飘落零星的雪花。

Asuka stopped on the road and pulled the goggles up from her eyes. There was too much condensation on the inside of them to see clearly anymore. Immediately the cold wind stung her eyeballs causing her to blink rapidly as they watered, the tears freezing almost instantly on her cheeks.

明日香在路中停下，将护目镜从眼前推起。镜片内侧凝结了太多水汽，已无法清晰视物。寒风立刻刺痛了她的眼球，使她不由自主地快速眨眼，泪水涌出，几乎瞬间在脸颊上凝结成冰。

"Ah, crap!" She said wearily. "It just gets better and better."

"啊，糟糕！" 她疲惫地说，"真是越来越好了。"

Screwing her eyes up against the wind she set back to pulling her burden the remaining couple of kilometres to the safety of the cabin and Shinji.

她眯起眼睛抵御风力，继续拖着沉重的负担，向着安全的小屋和真嗣所在的地方，坚持走完剩下的几公里。

Just a she had restarted her journey she heard a noise that turned her blood to ice in her veins. It was the unmistakeable howl of a wolf. The cold air made noise travel in unusual ways, but this had sounded frighteningly close to her. Almost instantly it was answered by another howl. This time it was from the other side of her position.

正当她重新踏上旅程时，一阵令她血液凝固的声响传来——那是狼的嚎叫，毋庸置疑。寒冷的空气使得声音传播方式异常，但这声嚎叫却近得令人心惊。几乎立刻，另一声嚎叫回应了它，这次是从她位置的另一侧传来的。

Despite her weariness Asuka picked up the pace. The snow was falling more heavily now, coating the icy road surface quickly in a soft layer that deadened her footfalls and made the World seem unnaturally quiet. With the increasing darkness and snowfall the surrounding area around her contract to just twenty metres or so. Beyond that she could see and hear nothing.

尽管疲惫不堪，明日香还是加快了脚步。此刻雪花愈发密集，迅速在冰冷的路面上铺上一层柔软的雪层，使她的脚步声变得沉闷，世界也因此显得异常寂静。随着夜色加深和雪势加大，她周围的视野范围缩减至仅约二十米。再远的地方，她便什么也看不见，什么也听不到了。

No further howls could be heard, but she didn't doubt that the wolves knew where she was. She picked up her pace, bending almost double under the strain of pulling the heavy sled through the powdery snow. She continued slogging through this silent landscape for what felt like an eternity.

再也听不到更多的狼嚎，但她毫不怀疑狼群知道她的位置。她加快了步伐，在拖动沉重的雪橇穿过粉状积雪时，几乎弯腰成九十度承受着巨大的压力。她在这片寂静的景致中艰难前行，仿佛经历了永恒。

Eventually the snow let up a little. There were still a few light flurries now and then, but she could now see a lot further even in the half light. From the glow on the horizon the moon was rising, causing the cloud cover to glow eerily above her.

最终，雪势稍有减弱。偶尔还有几阵轻飘的雪花，但在半明半暗中，她的视野已大为开阔。地平线上泛起的微光预示着月亮正在升起，使得云层在她头顶上空泛起诡异的光芒。

The terrain around her was also more clear too. With real relief she knew that just over the next rise she would actually be able to see their tiny cabin in the distance.

她周围的地形也更加清晰了。她真正感到宽慰的是，翻过下一个山丘，她就能在远处看到他们的小木屋了。

"Finally! Thank God for that!" She breathed in relief. Her voice instantly stolen away by the wind.

“终于！谢天谢地！”她如释重负地叹了口气。话音刚落，便被风夺走了。

Almost in answer to her a dark shape detached itself from the twilight around her and stopped on the road before her. Asuka froze as two more shapes joined the first and stood facing her. Standing squarely between her and her route to safety. She stole a quick glance behind her to see several more dark shapes blocking the road behind her.

仿佛是对她的回应，一个黑影从周围的暮色中分离出来，停在了她面前的路上。明日香僵住了，因为又有两个黑影加入了第一个，站在她对面。它们正好挡在她通往安全的路上。她迅速回头一瞥，看到几个黑影堵住了她身后的路。

Slowly she untied the sled from her body and unslung the rifle from her shoulder. A low growl carried on the wind from the wolves positioned in front of her.

她缓缓地从身上解开雪橇的绑带，从肩上卸下步枪。一阵低沉的咆哮随风传来，那是前方狼群发出的警告。

Asuka could hear her heartbeat pounding in her ears. She raised the rifle, pointing it at the shape of the bob-tailed wolf that she knew was the alpha male of the pack. At the last moment she spun around as some sixth sense alerted her to danger. She was just in time to see one of the larger wolves from the group behind her begin its running jump at her from behind.

明日香能听到自己的心跳在耳边砰砰作响。她举起步枪，瞄准那只短尾狼的轮廓，她知道那是狼群中的头狼。就在最后一刻，某种第六感警告她有危险，她迅速转身，及时看到狼群中一只较大的狼从背后向她发起奔跑跳跃的攻击。

Ka-boom! 轰隆！

The rifle's report rent the night air. Her attacker was dead by the time it crashed headlong into her, knocking her to the snowy ground. Despite the air being forced from her lungs temporarily she had enough presence of mind to be able to re-cock the gun before the rest of the pack was on her. Yet another loud boom echoed throughout the hills around her as a second animal collapsed lifeless to the ground.

枪声撕裂了夜空。当袭击者一头撞向她，将她撞倒在雪地上时，已经是一具尸体。尽管空气暂时被挤出肺部，她仍保持足够的清醒，能在其余狼群扑来前重新上膛。紧接着，又一声巨响在周围的山丘回荡，第二只野兽应声倒地，没了生气。

Then there was no more time.

随后，时间已所剩无几。

Asuka's World suddenly turned into a thrashing whirlwind of snapping jaws and flailing limbs as several wolves attacked her at once. Asuka screamed and kicked at one that was sinking its teeth into her leg, causing it to let go with a yelp. Another one she managed to smash in the jaw with the butt of her rifle, causing it to fall to the ground insensible.

明日香的世界突然变成了一个撕咬的旋风，几只狼同时向她发起攻击，利齿和挥舞的四肢交织。明日香尖叫着，一脚踢开正咬住她腿部的狼，使其痛叫着松口。另一只狼则被她用步枪枪托猛击下颚，倒地失去意识。

It was becoming harder and harder to wield the rifle with the wolves so close into her as she lay on the ground. One of the had hold of her left arm in its mouth. The thick material of her duffel coat prevented it from piercing her flesh, but the huge pressure of its jaws was crushing her forearm in a vise like grip. She was just managing to hold another off with the wooden stock of the rifle.

她躺在地上，狼群越来越近，越来越难以挥动步枪。其中一只狼咬住了她的左臂，厚实的粗呢大衣使其无法刺穿她的皮肤，但狼嘴巨大的压力像虎钳一样紧紧夹住她的前臂。她正勉强用步枪的木质枪托抵挡另一只狼的进攻。

The feeling of being all alone, seemingly helpless as bloodthirsty slavering jaws tried to rip her to pieces sent Asuka's memory straight back to the final battle with the Evangelion Mass Production Series. In her mind there was suddenly no difference between that awful day and her fight to the death that was happening right here. Once again she was alone, abandoned. No Shinji to come charging over the horizon to save her. Asuka was once again left to die a lonely and unremarked death.

那种孤立无援的感觉，仿佛嗜血的咆哮之口正试图将她撕成碎片，让明日香的记忆瞬间回到了与量产型福音战士系列的最终决战。在她心中，那个可怕的日子与此时此刻的生死搏斗毫无二致。她再次孤身一人，被遗弃。没有真嗣从天际冲来拯救她。明日香又一次面临着孤独而无人问津的死亡。

"Not this time…" She gritted out between her teeth as she strained to hold back the creature that threatened to rip her face off. Nothing but determination and the century old relic of a bygone war to save her.

"这次不行……" 她咬紧牙关挤出这句话，竭力抵挡着那只企图撕裂她面庞的怪物。此刻，唯有坚定的意志和那件承载着百年战争记忆的遗物能救她于危难。

Despite her limited range of movement she was doing her best to beat it back with her right arm and the rifle butt. Eventually it stepped back just enough for her to kick it with all of her force. She actually felt the animals ribs snapping under her boot as she kicked at it. That didn't stop it or its other injured pack mate from still trying to get at her, but her legs were flailing wildly at this time, preventing them from getting a hold of her lower limbs.

尽管她的活动范围受限，她仍竭尽全力用右臂和枪托将其击退。最终，它退后了足够距离，让她得以全力踢出一脚。她甚至感觉到动物的肋骨在她的靴下断裂。这并未阻止它和它那受伤的同伴继续试图攻击她，但此时她的双腿疯狂地挥舞着，使它们无法抓住她的下身。

With her right hand now able to let go of the rifle for a second she quickly unsheathed the long bayonet on her hip that she had been using as a hunting knife. Drawing out the razor sharp blade she wasted no time in sinking it right up to the hilt in the chest of the wolf that had hold of her left arm. The creature trembled and then rolled over without a sound as the shaft pierced its heart, robbing it of its life instantly.

她右手此刻得以短暂松开步枪，迅速从腰间拔出那把用作猎刀的长刺刀。抽出锋利无比的刀刃，她毫不迟疑地将它深深刺入紧咬她左臂的狼的胸膛，直至刀柄。那野兽颤抖了一下，随即无声地翻倒，心脏被刺穿，生命瞬间被夺走。

With that wolf dead she was able to struggle up to her knees and face the remaining two wolves. They kept a wary distance, circling her, looking for a weakness. From the way that they both moved she could tell that she had seriously injured them. One of them, the one she had kicked in the ribs, was letting out tiny whines as it breathed. It's broken ribs causing it intense pain with one of its lungs punctured and also was probably bleeding internally.

那只狼死后，她挣扎着跪起身，面对剩下的两只狼。它们保持着警惕的距离，围着她转圈，寻找弱点。从它们移动的方式，她能看出自己已经严重伤害了它们。其中一只，就是她踢中肋骨的那只，呼吸时发出微弱的呜咽声。它的肋骨断裂，导致剧痛，一个肺被刺穿，很可能还有内出血。

The other injured wolf was bleeding heavily from its jaw after being kicked earlier in the attack.

另一只在袭击中受伤的狼，在被踢后从下巴处大量出血。

Asuka ejected the spent cartridge and slammed another round into the chamber. She also, for the first time, attached the bayonet quickly to the front of her rifle. The extra weight on the end of the already heavy weapon made it a little more awkward to handle, but she felt considerably more confident about facing her two enemies with her rifle now able to double as a glaive if needed.

明日香将用过的弹壳退出，迅速将另一发子弹推入枪膛。同时，她首次迅速地将刺刀装在步枪前端。这额外增加的重量让本已沉重的武器握持起来略显笨拙，但她感到面对两名敌人时，步枪如今能兼作长柄刀使用，信心大增。

The two wolves suddenly started to come at her as she stood up to face them.

当她站起来面对它们时，两只狼突然开始向她扑来。

"Come on you fuckers!" She yelled as she shot one of them squarely in the chest. It dropped to the ground like a stone. As the second one reached her she braced her legs and thrust the bayonet deep into its thorax as it leapt at her. Impaling itself with the impact the dead weight of the wolf struck her, knocking her back to her knees.

"来吧，你们这些混蛋！" 她大喊着，一枪正中其中一人的胸膛。那人如石头般倒地。当第二个扑向她时，她稳住双腿，用刺刀深深刺入其胸腔。随着冲击，狼的尸体沉重地撞向她，将她击退至跪地。

Getting back to her feet and drawing the bloody bayonet from the dying creature Asuka gritted her teeth as she drove it back into the wolf's heart. Killing it instantly. She did the same to the one that she had managed to knock out at the beginning of her fight with the pack.

她重新站起身，从那垂死的生物体内抽出沾血的刺刀，明日香咬紧牙关，将其再次刺入狼的心脏，瞬间结束了它的生命。她对战斗初期设法击倒的那只狼也采取了同样的行动。

Wiping the blade on the fur of the dead animal she slung the rifle back over her shoulder and walked wearily back over to the abandoned sled. Sometime during the fight the snow had stopped altogether and the cloud cover was beginning to thin out. As she began her walk to the cabin again, carefully holding her painfully throbbing left arm, the moon showed itself from behind a bank of clouds for the first time that night. It was a full moon like she hadn't seen since that awful day on the beach nearly a year ago. Its face still marred by the bloody red wound across the sky left by Third Impact.

她将刀刃在死去的动物毛皮上擦拭干净，重新将步枪挎回肩上，疲惫地走回那辆废弃的雪橇旁。战斗期间，雪已经完全停了，云层也开始变得稀薄。当她再次启程向小屋走去时，小心翼翼地托着疼痛难忍的左臂，月亮首次从云层后露出了脸。这是一轮满月，自那可怕的海滩之日近一年来她未曾再见。它的面容依旧带着天空中那道血红的伤痕，那是第三次冲击留下的印记。

She crested the small rise in the road and could see the valley spread out before her. In the distance the tiny cabin could be made out with its small cluster of outbuildings. Even further, shimmering weirdly in the moonlight the shoreline and LCL sea could just be seen. Asuka ignored it as she had since the day she had left it behind. She had no desire to be reminded of that painful time.

她越过道路上的小坡，眼前豁然开朗，山谷一览无余。远处，那间小木屋及其周围的一小簇附属建筑依稀可辨。更远处，月光下波光粼粼、显得有些诡异的岸边和 LCL 之海隐约可见。自从离开那天起，明日香就一直对此视而不见，她不想被提醒那段痛苦的时光。

Carefully making her way along the now slippery roadway with the sled in tow Asuka had no warning of the attack until it hit her.

小心翼翼地沿着现在变得滑溜的道路拖着雪橇前行，明日香直到被攻击前都没有任何预警。

She was momentarily stunned as teeth and fur crashed into her from behind, knocking her to the ground yet again. It was the Bob-tailed wolf. The leader of the pack that she had just decimated. Inwardly she cursed her own stupidity as she realised that she hadn't bothered to account for all of the animals that had attacked her. Her eyes danced with stars at the force of impact and she could feel the hot blood from a gash on her forehead that the wolf's jaws had opened up when it had hit her.

她瞬间被惊呆了，牙齿和皮毛从背后猛烈撞击，再次将她击倒在地。是那只短尾狼，她刚刚消灭的狼群首领。她内心咒骂自己的愚蠢，意识到她没有费心去计算所有攻击她的动物。撞击的力量让她的眼前金星乱舞，能感觉到额头上一道被狼牙撕开的伤口正涌出滚烫的鲜血。

The big wolf snarled and snapped at her as she fought to hold it off. Its rank breath washed over her and its hot saliva dripped from its jaws and onto her face as she held it back with her arms at full stretch.

大灰狼咆哮着向她猛扑，她奋力抵抗。那股恶臭的气息扑面而来，热乎乎的唾液从狼嘴中滴落，溅在她的脸上，她竭尽全力伸直双臂抵挡着。

Holding the crazed creature off her with her agonized left arm she wrapped her right hand around its skinny throat. The wolf's eyes bulged and its attempts to get at her became more and more frantic as she squeezed it tighter and tighter. Her breathing was harsh and painful in the cold air as she held back its bloodthirsty jaws fro her face. Finally she felt a sickening crushing sensation under her clawing fingers and the wolf collapsed on top of her, still twitching and struggling in a uncoordinated manner.

她用痛苦不堪的左臂挡住那狂乱的生物，右手紧紧扼住它瘦弱的喉咙。随着她越掐越紧，狼的眼睛瞪得老大，试图攻击她的动作愈发疯狂。在寒冷的空气中，她的呼吸粗重而痛苦，竭力抵挡着那嗜血的狼口远离自己的脸庞。最终，她感到手指下传来一阵令人作呕的碎裂感，狼在她身上瘫倒，依旧抽搐着，挣扎得毫无章法。

Asuka pushed the wolf off of her and got back to her feet. She went and picked the rifle up from where it had dropped when she had first been struck. Deliberately she unfastened the bayonet and put it back into its sheath. The she slowly walked up to the fallen wolf and lowered the rifle to its head.

明日香将狼从身上推开，重新站了起来。她走过去，从最初被袭击时掉落的地方捡起了步枪。她故意地解开刺刀，将其放回鞘中。然后，她缓缓走向倒地的狼，将步枪对准了它的头部。

"Geh mit Gott" she said as she pulled the trigger.

她扣动扳机时说：“愿上帝与你同在。”

Not bothering with the rapidly drying blood on her face she walked back to her sled and dragged it the last painful hundred metres or so to the turnoff for the farm.

她不顾脸上迅速干涸的血迹，走回雪橇旁，拖着它艰难地走完最后痛苦的一百米左右，到达通往农场的岔路口。

As she walked her tongue couldn't help but explore a new gap in its surroundings.

她走着走着，舌头不由自主地探查起周围新出现的空隙。

"Ah, crap!" Asuka exclaimed. "I just lost another fucking tooth!"

"啊，该死！" 明日香惊呼道，"我又掉了一颗该死的牙！"

She could tell something was amiss before she had even got to the front door.

她甚至还没走到前门，就能感觉到有些不对劲。

Something just felt… wrong. The wind had stopped completely. The cabin sat broodingly in the brightness of the full moon. For the first time that she could remember, the sky was completely clear above the building. There had often been small clear patches of sky over the months here. But they were few and short lived. Now the moon and stars clearly were visible together for one of the few times in this World. Free of the clouds that usually obscured it the bloody arc across the sky looked closer than it ever had before now. It almost looked as it touched the ground off to the south west of her.

某种感觉……不对劲。风完全停了。小屋在满月的明亮光辉中沉思般地静坐着。她记忆中，这是第一次，建筑上方的天空完全清澈。过去几个月里，偶尔会有小块晴朗的天空，但它们稀少且短暂。如今，月亮和星星在这世上难得一见地清晰共存。没有了通常遮挡它们的云层，那道血色弧线横跨天际，看起来比以往任何时候都要近。它几乎像是触碰到了她西南方向的地面。

As she reached the front door that hung open on its hinges all of these things became unimportant to her.

当她走到那扇敞开在铰链上的前门时，所有这些事情对她来说都变得不重要了。

"What the fuck?" She exclaimed, as he dropped the tow line and ran up the front steps and into the cabin.

"搞什么鬼？" 她惊呼道，就在他松开拖绳，冲上前面台阶并跑进船舱的那一刻。

Inside the building all was dark and silent. The fire was dead in the grate and with the cold air coming in from the open front door it was like an icebox in there. Asuka fumbled with some matches and managed to light the hurricane lantern. In the feeble illumination it cast her worst nightmare was revealed.

楼内一片漆黑寂静，壁炉中的火已熄灭，加上前门敞开涌入的寒气，屋内宛如冰窖。明日香摸索着找到一些火柴，费力地点燃了防风灯。在它微弱的光照下，她最可怕的噩梦被揭露了出来。

Shinji was gone. 真嗣已经离开了。

Chapter Four 第四章

Asuka on the Shore II

岸边的明日香 II

The blankets on the empty futon had been roughly cast onto the floor at her feet. She felt the mattress but it was cold. God only knew how long it had been since Shinji had lain there. Frantically she searched the rest of the small house. Nothing. The bathroom and derelict bedrooms showed no sign that he had even been there.

空荡荡的被褥被粗暴地扔到她脚下的地板上。她触摸了床垫，却是冰冷的。只有天知道真嗣已经离开多久了。她焦急地在狭小的屋子里搜寻，一无所获。浴室和废弃的卧室没有留下他曾来过的任何痕迹。

Forgetting her pain and fatigue she ran outside with the lantern and searched the outbuildings. No trace of Shinji there either. Asuka fell to her knees in the cold snow with her head bowed. She wanted to cry, she wanted to scream of rail against the unfairness of it all. Nothing would come though. No tears, no curse vindictive enough to smite the Universe for its cruelty. So she just knelt there, the snow slowly soaking her lower legs with a biting cold that she didn't even feel.

忘记了疼痛和疲惫，她提着灯笼跑出屋外，搜寻着各个外屋。那里也没有真嗣的踪迹。明日香跪倒在冰冷的雪地上，低着头。她想哭，想尖叫，想痛斥这一切的不公。然而，什么也发不出来。没有泪水，没有足够恶毒的诅咒来惩罚宇宙的残忍。于是她只能跪在那里，雪慢慢地浸湿了她的双腿，那刺骨的寒冷她甚至都感觉不到。

Eventually the lantern sputtered and its tiny flame died out. Asuka levered herself back up to her feet using the rifle as a crutch. Angrily she kicked at the dead lantern which performed a graceful spiral before crashing into the side of the cabin.

最终，灯笼闪烁了几下，微弱的火焰熄灭了。明日香用步枪作支撑，艰难地站起身来。她愤怒地踢向熄灭的灯笼，它优雅地旋转了一圈，然后撞到了小屋的侧面。

"What the fuck am I supposed to do now?" She asked the full moon. Shinji was gone. The only thing that she actually had in this World had been taken from her. Asuka looked at the rifle speculatively. Feeling as if for the first time its weight and power. Raising the muzzle closer to her face she looked down the dark hole of the barrel. It would only take a small movement and all of this could be over. She had known that once their food failed this was always an option, but now, with Shinji gone, what was stopping her?

"我现在该怎么办？"她对着满月问道。真嗣已经离开了。在这个世界上，她真正拥有的东西已经被夺走了。明日香若有所思地看着那把步枪。第一次感受到它的重量和威力。她将枪口举向自己的脸，凝视着枪管深处的黑暗。只需轻轻一动，这一切就可以结束。她早就知道，一旦食物耗尽，这始终是一个选择，但现在，真嗣不在了，还有什么能阻止她呢？

She closed her eyes and breathed deeply. The distinctive smell of gunmetal mixed with a kind of hot coppery smell that was due to its recent firing filling her nostrils.

她闭上眼睛，深吸一口气。枪械特有的金属气味混合着因最近开火而产生的温热铜腥味，充斥着她的鼻腔。

'It would be so easy…' She thought as her fingers tightened around the stock.

'这将是如此简单……' 她想着，手指紧紧握住枪托。

Unbidden the image of her Mother hanging lifeless from the ceiling of her bedroom came into the girl's mind. Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu's swollen and discoloured face stretched into a kind of leering grin as she stared down at her stricken daughter. Asuka's eyes sprang open at the image and she found herself still staring down the barrel of the ancient rifle.

那幅画面不由自主地浮现在女孩的脑海中——她的母亲在卧室天花板上吊着，毫无生气。绫波丽·齐柏林·索伦的肿胀且变色面孔扭曲成一种狞笑，俯视着她那受惊的女儿。明日香的眼睛因这画面猛地睁开，发现自己仍盯着那把古老步枪的枪管。

"No Mama…" She whispered. "I won't give up like you did."

不，妈妈…" 她低声说，"我不会像你那样放弃的。

Feeling a new sense of determination Asuka slung the rifle back over her shoulder and set out again into the night. Baka Shinji was out there somewhere. She was going to find him and kick his scrawny ass back to Second Impact.

感受到新的决心，明日香重新将步枪挎在肩上，再次踏入夜色。那个笨蛋真嗣一定在某处。她要找到他，把他那瘦弱的屁股踢回第二次冲击。

The bright light of the full Moon and the fresh layer of snow made it surprisingly easy to pick up his trail. Once she had walked back to the roadway and looked around it had only taken her a couple of minutes to make out a reasonably fresh set of footprints heading off to the southwest. The direction appeared to be straight and purposeful and she knew that it had to be him. The footprints were bigger than hers and the appeared to have been made by someone with bare feet. She figured that he couldn't have gotten too far in that state. Not to mention the fact that he was in even worse shape than she was. She shook her head at herself at her previous despair. Shinji was still out there somewhere! She'd find him no matter what. Asuka Langley Soryu never gave up!

满月的明亮光芒和新鲜的一层雪使得追踪他的踪迹出奇地容易。她走回道路，四处观察后，只用了几分钟就辨认出一串相当新鲜的脚印，朝西南方向延伸。这方向显得直接而目的明确，她知道那一定是他。脚印比她的要大，看起来像是赤脚留下的。她推测，以那种状态，他不可能走得太远。更不用说他比她还要糟糕。她对自己之前的绝望摇了摇头。真嗣一定还在某个地方！无论怎样，她都要找到他。阿苏卡·兰格雷·索西尔从不放弃！

Before too long it became clear where he was heading. Her heart sank a little when she realised. She hadn't been on this particular stretch of road for nearly a year now. The only thing that it led to was that accursed shoreline that Shinji and her had first awoken in this ruined World all that time ago.

不久之后，他要去的地方变得清晰起来。当她意识到这一点时，她的心沉了下去。她已经将近一年没有走过这条特定的路了。这条路唯一通往的地方，就是那个被诅咒的海岸线，很久以前，真嗣和她在这个破败的世界中首次醒来。

Gritting her teeth she walked on under the full moon.

她咬紧牙关，在满月下继续前行。

As she approached the shore the snow thinned out gradually until it was gone completely. The land was just as ravaged but the cold and wind seemed to have not touched this landscape. Her breath no longer steamed as she panted her way along the track and the air itself felt warmer and warmer as she got closer to her goal.

当她接近岸边时，雪逐渐变薄，直至完全消失。这片土地同样满目疮痍，但寒冷和风似乎并未触及这里的景致。她沿着小径喘息前行，呼吸不再冒出白气，随着目标的临近，空气也感觉越来越温暖。

By the time she had reached the beach where this nightmare had begun she had taken off her coat and was actually perspiring heavily beneath her heavy sweater and pants.

当她抵达这场噩梦开始的海滩时，她已经脱掉了外套，在厚重的毛衣和裤子下，实际上已经大汗淋漓。

The silence of the sea shore was eerie and complete. She walked past the driftwood marker with its bloodstained cross and down to the edge of the beach. The dark liquid in front of her looked a sickly red in the moonlight. Like sea of blood. The huge split visage of Ayanami lay rotting off in the distance. It was too horrible to even look at now.

海滨的寂静诡异而彻底。她走过那块血迹斑斑的浮木标记，下到沙滩边缘。在她面前，那深色液体在月光下呈现出病态的红色，宛如血海。远处，绫波巨大的裂面正腐烂着，如今已可怕到不忍直视。

Looking the shoreline up and down she could see a faint trail of footprints leading further south and around a small headland. She followed them as they thankfully took her away from the horrible image of the failure of Third Impact.

她沿着海岸线仔细观察，发现了一条模糊的足迹，向南延伸并绕过一个小岬角。她跟随这些足迹，庆幸它们将她带离了第三次冲击失败那可怕的景象。

Rounding the headland she saw in the distance a rumpled pile of material right on the edge of the sea. She picked up her pace and quickly came up to it, she noticed that the footprints also seemed to end there as well. Dropping down to her knees to examine it closely she recognised it straight away. It was the large flannel shirt that she had dressed Shinji in the night before. It had been discarded there on the shoreline. Asuka looked around wildly. There were no more footprints for her to follow. No sign of a now naked Third Child waling off into the distance or floating in the sea.

绕过海岬，她远远望见一堆皱巴巴的布料紧贴着海边。她加快脚步，迅速走近，注意到脚印似乎也在此戛然而止。跪下仔细查看，她立刻认出那正是前一晚给真嗣穿上的那件大法兰绒衬衫，此刻被遗弃在岸边。明日香焦急地四处张望，再无脚印可循，也不见一丝第三适格者赤身离去或漂浮海上的踪迹。

Asuka held the discarded shirt to her face. Tears beginning to stream down her face as she held the material to her, enveloping her in his scent. He was gone. There was no longer any sense of Shinji Ikari existing on this plane.

明日香将那件被丢弃的衬衫紧贴在脸上，泪水开始顺着她的脸颊流淌，她紧紧抱着那件衣物，让自己沉浸在他的气息中。他已经离开了。在这个世界上，再无碇真嗣存在的痕迹。

"It's not fucking fair!" She screamed at the vivid moon. "I didn't choose this crapsack World, he did!" Asuka scrunched up the shirt and threw it into the LCL ocean. It quickly turned a bloody red in the moonlight and sank out of view. "He dumps me in this shit-hole, makes me care for him for a fucking year and then abandons me? What the fuck did I ever do to him to deserve this?"

"这他妈太不公平了！"她对着那轮明亮的月亮尖叫道，"我可没选择这个烂世界，是他选的！"明日香抓起衬衫，扔进了 LCL 海洋。在月光下，它迅速染成了血红色，然后沉没不见。"他把我丢在这个鬼地方，让我为他操心了一整年，然后就抛弃我？我他妈到底对他做了什么，要受这种罪？"

The girl threw herself face first into the warm sand and cried bitterly to herself. A complete sense of desolation weighed down on her soul. She was alone. In reality she had been alone her whole life. But now everything that mattered had been stripped from her completely. A true sense of perspective on the isolation she now occupied hit her and it completely overwhelmed her.

女孩一头扎进温暖的沙子里，独自痛哭。一种彻底的孤寂感沉重地压在她的灵魂上。她孤身一人。实际上，她一生都是孤独的。但现在，所有重要的东西都被彻底剥夺了。她现在所处的孤立无援的真实感受击中了她，这完全让她崩溃。

With Shinji, the boy that she had a various times called an idiot, useless, a millstone around her neck and a waste of her time was gone. Without living for him for the last year she would have given up long ago. The boy was a constant in her life, and had been since that far off day on the 'Over The Rainbow'. With him gone… What did she actually have?

与真嗣，那个她曾多次称之为笨蛋、无用、累赘和浪费时间的男孩，已经不在了。如果没有过去一年为他而活，她早就放弃了。这个男孩是她生活中的常数，自从那遥远的一天在“彩虹之上”开始就是如此。他不在了……她实际上还拥有什么呢？

As her tears finally dried up Asuka felt a sense of relief wash over her. She had reached a point of epiphany. Wiping the tears from her face with sand covered hands she got back up to her feet and stood looking out over the sea. Taking a deep breath she pulled off her sweater and undid the buttons on her shirt and pants. Throwing each item of clothing into the sea and watching it sink as she did so.

当她的泪水终于干涸，明日香感到一种释然涌上心头。她达到了顿悟的境地。用沾满沙子的手擦去脸上的泪水，她重新站起来，凝视着大海。深吸一口气，她脱下毛衣，解开衬衫和裤子的扣子。每脱一件衣物就抛入海中，看着它们沉没。

Now Asuka stood naked on the shoreline. An enormous sense of a weight lifted from her shoulders and freedom washed over her. Lifting her scarred and bony arms high above her head in the moonlight she breathed in the air for what felt like the first time. The light breeze felt soothing against her skin and she lowered her arms and looked away from the sea, with the full moon sitting high above it, and down to the last remaining item that she had carried onto the beach with her.

此刻，明日香赤裸地站在海岸线上。一种巨大的重负从她肩上卸下，自由感涌遍全身。在月光下，她举起布满疤痕的瘦弱双臂，仿佛第一次深呼吸。微风轻抚肌肤，带来舒缓，她放下手臂，目光从海面和其上高悬的满月移开，低头看向她带到海滩上的最后一件物品。

She bent down and for the second time that night she held the old rifle in her hands. This time though, there was nothing but certainty in her mind. She did not belong in this empty World. Leaving it was not giving up. She was not following in her Mother's footsteps. She was making her own choice. And Asuka Langley Soryu chose freedom from this dead World. In reality she knew that she would die here one way or the other. Now with Shinji gone, why waste time waiting for the inevitable?

她弯下腰，那一夜第二次将那把老式步枪握在手中。然而这次，她的心中只有坚定。她不属于这个空洞的世界。离开并非放弃，她并非追随母亲的脚步。她在做出自己的选择。而惣流·明日香·兰格雷选择了从这个死寂世界中解脱的自由。实际上，她清楚自己无论如何都会在这里死去。如今，真嗣已离去，为何还要浪费时间等待那不可避免的结局呢？

"Ikuhayo, Asuka…" She whispered to herself as she once again held the muzzle of the rifle up to her face. Her hands gripping the stock tightly as she positioned it in what she felt was the most likely way to achieve her end.

"去吧，明日香…" 她低声自语，再次将步枪的枪口对准自己的脸。双手紧紧握住枪托，调整至她认为最有可能达成目的的位置。

She took one last breath of the warm night air and braced herself as her right hand moved towards the trigger.

她深吸了一口温暖的夜气，右手移向扳机，做好了准备。

"Before you consider that, Second Child, I would like to discuss with you another option." A soft but oh so familiar voice came from behind her.

“在你考虑那个之前，二宝，我想和你探讨另一个选择。”一个柔和却无比熟悉的声音从她身后传来。

Asuka spun around in shock, her hands lifelessly dropping the forgotten rifle onto the sand at her feet.

明日香惊恐地转过身来，双手无力地让那把被遗忘的步枪掉落在脚边的沙地上。

"W-Wondergirl?" She gasped.

"W-神奇女孩？" 她倒吸一口凉气。

The other girl grimaced slightly before speaking again. "That is one name that you have called me in the past, Second Child. In truth I am not the Rei Ayanami that you knew in the past, though she is a part of me. I am both Lilith, what you would call the Second Angel and Rei Ayanami too. I was born anew in Third Impact and bound to the will of the Third Child. It was by his will that we created this World."

另一个女孩微微皱眉后再次开口：“那是你过去对我的称呼之一，二号孩子。实际上，我并非你过去所认识的绫波丽，尽管她是我的一部分。我既是你们所称的第二使徒莉莉丝，也是绫波丽。我在第三次冲击中重生，并受第三孩子的意志束缚。正是遵从他的意志，我们创造了这个世界。”

Asuka gaped at the young woman before her. Naked like herself, the being in front of her resembled the Rei Ayanami that she had known almost exactly. Although now her eyes were a deeper red and the sense of unease that she had always felt around the girl was magnified by an otherworldly aura that she couldn't quite place, but also felt strangely familiar at the same time.

明日香目瞪口呆地看着面前的年轻女子。和她一样赤裸，眼前这个存在与她所熟知的绫波丽几乎一模一样。尽管现在她的眼睛是更深的红色，那种她一直感觉到的围绕着女孩的不安被一种难以言明却又莫名熟悉的外来气息放大了。

"Yeah, well. As you can see, Lilith… Rei… Whoever you are, you did a great job with that one! You should have known that Baka couldn't be trusted to make a World in his own image. I mean, he's always been a total screw up, how was he ever gonna make this work?"

是啊，好吧。正如你所见，莉莉丝……丽……不管你是谁，你这次做得太棒了！你早该知道，那个笨蛋是不可能按照自己的形象创造出一个世界的。我的意思是，他一直都是个彻底的失败者，他怎么可能让这一切成功呢？

A look of sadness crossed Rei/Lilith's face. "It's true, Second Child, we did not expect that this World would be the outcome of Pilot Ikari's choice. We trusted that his desire to exist in the Human World, with all of its faults and pain, was the right one for Humanity and one that he could make work."

悲伤的神情掠过绫波/莉莉丝的脸庞。“的确，第二适格者，我们未曾预料到这个世界会是碇真嗣选择的结果。我们曾相信，他渴望存在于这个充满缺陷与痛苦的人类世界，是符合人类利益的正确选择，也是他能够使之运转的选择。”

"Big mistake." Asuka interrupted.

“大错特错。”明日香打断道。

"We could not foresee that he would have been so badly broken by his experiences that he was unable to conceive of a World that could be inhabited by the souls of others. Only you, Second Child, only you had the strength and will to return when he summoned you."

我们未能预见，他的经历竟将他摧残得如此支离破碎，以至于他无法想象一个能被他人灵魂栖息的世界。唯有你，次子，唯有你拥有力量与意志，在他召唤时回归。

"Wait a second…" Asuka said outraged. "He summoned me? I think that you must be mistaken. I didn't come to be at his beck and call. I'm nobody's lapdog!"

“等一下……”明日香愤怒地说，“他召唤了我？我想你一定是搞错了。我来这里不是为了听他使唤。我不是任何人的走狗！”

"You would not be here if he had not wished it, Second Child." Rei/Lilith answered her. "Therefore you are the one person that he felt, even if it was subconsciously, that he needed to have with him. You, for whatever reason, are close to the centre of his World Pilot Soryu. Only you, it would seem, have the power to influence Shinji and save this World from death."

“如果他不希望你在这里，你就不会出现，第二适格者。” 丽/莉莉丝回答她。“因此，你是他潜意识中觉得必须带在身边的人。无论出于什么原因，你都靠近了他的世界核心，碇真嗣。似乎只有你，才有能力影响真嗣，拯救这个世界免于灭亡。”

"Now you tell me!" Asuka yelled in exasperation. "It's a little fucking late for that now, isn't it? In case you hadn't noticed, Shinji's gone! This whole god-damned rock is just about dead and if you'll excuse me I've got an appointment with a .303 bullet that I'm already late for!"

"现在你才告诉我！"明日香气急败坏地喊道，"现在说这个是不是有点太晚了？如果你还没注意到，真嗣已经走了！这个该死的破地方几乎完蛋了，如果你不介意的话，我还有个和.303 子弹的约会，我已经迟到了！"

Asuka bent down to pick up the rifle again but was stopped with gesture from the other girl.

明日香再次弯腰去捡步枪，却被另一个女孩的手势阻止了。

"That is why I am here." The being said. "As I have said, only you have the power to influence Shinji and stop this World from dying. The best way to achieve this is to prevent it from having come into being in the first place."

“这就是我在这里的原因。”那个存在说道，“正如我所说，只有你拥有影响真嗣并阻止这个世界消亡的力量。最佳的办法就是阻止它最初的存在。”

Asuka looked at her in puzzlement. "Stop talking in riddles Wondergirl. Just say what you mean for once!"

明日香困惑地看着她。“别再打哑谜了，奇迹少女。这次就直接说你的意思吧！”

The ethereal being managed to look a little annoyed at Asuka's interruption. "What I mean, Second Child, is that if you had been able to more positively influence the Third Child's state of mind in the time before Third Impact, then there is a chance that this dying World may never come in to existence at all. Thereby saving Humanity and the Earth from destruction."

那超凡的存在对明日香打断自己显得有些不悦。“我的意思是，第二适格者，如果你能在第三次冲击之前更积极地影响第三适格者的心态，那么这个世界或许根本就不会走向灭亡。这样一来，人类和地球就能免于毁灭。”

"Ooookay…" Asuka answered dubiously. "So if I hadn't been such a bitch to Shinji all those months ago, maybe the World wouldn't be a big pile of shit right now. Sheesh, thanks for the pep talk Ayanami. I really feel great about myself now. Way to rub salt into my wounds."

"哦哦哦，好吧……" 明日香半信半疑地回答道，"这么说，如果我几个月前没有对真嗣那么刻薄，也许世界现在就不会是一团糟了。哎呀，谢谢你的鼓励，绫波。我现在真的对自己感觉好极了。真是哪壶不开提哪壶。"

"You misunderstand Child. I am saying that there is a chance for you to go back and attempt to have a positive influence on the Third's mental state. The opportunity to put you in that place is narrow, so I must act now. But I am forbidden from acting without your consent."

你误会了，孩子。我是说你有机会回去，尝试对第三者的精神状态产生积极影响。将你置于那个位置的机会很渺茫，所以我必须现在行动。但我未经你同意是不能采取行动的。

"Right. So let me get this straight. You're offering me a chance to go back to before the Third Impact. Schmooze up to Shinji and make him feel like a big man. If I do that maybe, just maybe, the World doesn't die and I don't get stuck here all alone, having awkwardly naked conversations with the ghost of a girl that I hated."

好的，让我理清楚。你是在给我一个机会，回到第三次冲击之前。去讨好真嗣，让他感觉自己很了不起。如果我这么做，或许，只是或许，世界不会灭亡，我也不会被困在这里，孤独地与一个我曾讨厌的女孩的幽灵进行尴尬的裸聊。

"That would be a reasonably accurate summation, aside from a few minor points."

那是一个相当准确的总结，除了几个小细节。

Asuka was silent for a moment. "Sure, What have I got to lose?"

明日香沉默了一会儿。“当然，我有什么可失去的呢？”

The apparition seemed the slump her shoulders in relief. "That is well, Pilot Soryu. Without this opportunity, this World is doomed to die."

幻影似乎松了一口气，肩膀微微下垂。“很好，Soryu 飞行员。没有这次机会，这个世界注定要灭亡。”

"So no pressure then!" Asuka answered sarcastically. "So what now? Do you wave your hands around and say a heap of mumbo jumbo, or what? I haven't got all day!"

"那就没有压力了嘛！" 明日香讽刺地回答道，"那现在怎么办？你是要挥挥手念一堆咒语，还是怎样？我可没那么多时间！"

xxxxx 源文本：xxxxxx 翻译文本：

"Haven't got all day for what Asuka?" Hikari asked, looking back at where Asuka sat at her desk in Classroom 2-A of Tokyo-3 Middle School.

"阿苏卡，我们可没一整天的时间耗在这上面，怎么了？" 光回头望向东京第三中学 2-A 教室里坐在自己座位上的阿苏卡问道。

The Class Representative looked on in shock as her best friend's eyes went wide and she stood up rapidly, knocking her plastic chair onto the floor behind her.

班长震惊地看着，她最好的朋友眼睛瞪得大大的，迅速站起来，把塑料椅子撞倒在了身后的地板上。

"What the FUCK!" The German girl screamed, much to the amusement of the rest of the class.

"搞什么鬼！"德国女孩尖叫道，引得全班哄堂大笑。

"Miss Soryu, is there a problem?" The Old Sensei asked, mercifully interrupting his latest History of the Second Impact lecture.

"This is not fucking real, this is not fucking real!"

这他妈不是真的，这他妈不是真的！

"Hey Kensuke, looks like the Devil's completely lost her shit!" Toji whispered to his spectacled friend.

"嘿，健介，看来那个恶魔彻底疯了！" 东治低声对戴眼镜的朋友说。

"Had to happen sooner or later." Aida replied.

"迟早会发生的事。" 艾达回答道。

"Asuka, are you okay?" Shinji asked with concern for his house mate.

"明日香，你没事吧？" 真嗣关切地询问他的室友。

"This isn't real!" Asuka kept screaming. "You're all fucking dead! I saw it!"

"这不是真的！"明日香不停地尖叫，"你们都他妈的死了！我亲眼看见的！"

"Miss Soryu! Contain your outburst and sit down!" That Sensei said in a futile attempt to return order to his class.

"堇小姐！控制一下你的情绪，坐下！" 那位老师徒劳地试图恢复课堂秩序。

Asuka spun around and pointed an accusing finger at the desk where Rei Ayanami sat, watching her impassively from next to the window.

明日香转身指向坐在窗边桌子旁的绫波丽，后者正无动于衷地注视着她。

"You!" Asuka cried. "You did this didn't you! I wasn't fucking ready you bitch!"

"你！" 明日香喊道，"这是你干的吧！我他妈的还没准备好，你这个贱人！"

"I am unsure as to what it is you are referring to, Pilot Soryu." Was the blue haired girl's answer.

“我不确定你指的是什么，索龙飞行员。”蓝发女孩回答道。

"Arrrgh! I can't take this!" Asuka yelled. With her mind in overload she made a run for the door and away from the classroom. Unfortunately for her, Ryoko Aomori, a girl who had long resented the pretty foreign girl's stealing of her limelight, surreptitiously stuck her foot out as the German girl ran past. Sending her crashing headlong into the desks nearest the classroom door. Several gasps and a small smattering of applause rang out as Asuka lay there amongst the wreckage, a large gash on her forehead. She lay supine on the classroom floorboards, seemingly unconscious, apart from muttering "All dead. All dead. All dead. All dead…" Over and over to herself.

"啊！我受不了了！" 明日香大喊道。她的思绪超载，冲向门口，逃离了教室。不幸的是，青森凉子，一个长期嫉妒这位漂亮外国女孩抢走她风头的女生，在德国女孩跑过时偷偷伸出了脚。结果明日香一头撞向了靠近教室门的几张桌子。随着明日香躺在一片狼藉中，额头上有一道大伤口，教室里响起了几声惊呼和零星的掌声。她仰面躺在教室的地板上，似乎失去了意识，只是不断地喃喃自语："都死了。都死了。都死了。都死了……"

"Ikari and Class Representative Horaki. Please Take miss Soryu to the school Nurse. The rest of you, turn to page 216 of your 'History of the Second Impact." Textbooks"

碇和班长堀越，请带索留香小姐去校医室。其他人，请翻到《第二次冲击历史》课本的第 216 页。

Shinji and Hikari quickly attended to their fallen friend dragging her out into the corridor as the rest of the class groaned and returned to their books.

真嗣和光迅速照顾倒下的朋友，将她拖到走廊上，而班上其他同学则呻吟着回到书本前。

When it didn't seem that Asuka was returning to consciousness any time soon, Shinji used his mobile phone to call Misato who arranged to have NERV medical came and pick up the stricken girl straight away and bring her to the NERV Infirmary.

当阿苏卡似乎不会很快恢复意识时，真嗣用手机联系了美里，后者立即安排 NERV 医疗团队前来接走这位受伤的女孩，并直接将她送往 NERV 医务室。

Shinji watched slightly enviously as Hikari sat holding Asuka's hand while they both waited for the NERV Ambulance to arrive.

真嗣略带羡慕地看着，光坐在那里握着明日香的手，两人一同等待着 NERV 救护车的到来。

End Chapter 4 第四章结束

So there, finally, is the transition chapter. The change from post to pre-3I was supposed to be a jarring one, hopefully it was successful on that point and not to disorienting. It seemed the best way to convey Asuka's shock at the change.

于是，终于迎来了过渡章节。从后三 I 时代到前三 I 时代的转变本应是突兀的，希望在这点上它成功了，不至于让人感到迷失方向。这似乎是传达明日香对变化感到震惊的最佳方式。

On a side note... This chapter was written in one day. I'm not bragging, it's more to point out that if there are any problems with it it was written in a rush of inspiration so I'm hoping that it doesn't suffer for it stylistically or story wise. Some of the earlier chapters took ages to write, especially chapter 2, so I just ran with this one while the going was good.

顺便提一下……这一章是在一天之内完成的。我并非自夸，而是想指出，如果其中存在任何问题，那是因为它是在灵感的冲动下匆忙写就的，所以我希望它在风格或故事上不会因此受到影响。之前的某些章节，尤其是第二章，耗费了很长时间来撰写，所以这次趁着灵感充沛，我便一气呵成地完成了这一章。

I'm terrible at self editing and have no poor long suffering pre-readers, so I hope that this chapter has been enjoyable to read and not just a mess!

我非常不擅长自我编辑，也没有长期受苦的预读者，所以希望这一章读起来令人愉快，而不只是一团糟！

From this point I shall be publishing chapters as I write them. I just felt the need to get the story to this place in the narrative to move onward from!

从这一点开始，我将边写边发布章节。我只是觉得有必要将故事推进到这个叙述节点，以便继续向前发展！

Cheers! 干杯！

Chapter 5: Terror, Like Charity, Begins at Home

第五章：恐怖，如同慈善，始于家中

So finally here is Chapter 5 of Unbroken! Massive Apologies for how long this has taken to be published. I struggled with a bit of writer's block with this chapter, but I think that I've managed to overcome it thanks to some good advice I was given a week or so ago! I'll try to keep the updates a little more timely, I hope, from here on in.

最终，《坚不可摧》的第五章终于与大家见面了！对于发布延迟，我深感抱歉。这一章我遭遇了些许写作障碍，但得益于大约一周前得到的宝贵建议，我想我已经克服了它！我会尽力让更新更加及时，希望从此以后能保持这样的节奏。

I don't own Evangelion or any of the characters portrayed in this story.

我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》或本故事中描绘的任何角色。

Unbroken 坚不可摧

## Chapter 5 Terror, like Charity, Begins at Home

恐怖，如同慈善，始于家

Warmth. 温暖。

Warmth and voices. 温暖与声音。

She knew that she was dreaming, because so often her dreams had been haunted by these long lost sensations. Sometimes the voices that came brought comfort to the girl. More often though the voices were harsh and accusing. Holding her in the thrall of the guilt that her survival had earned her.

她知道自己在做梦，因为这些久违的感觉常常在梦中萦绕。有时，传来的声音给女孩带来安慰。但更多时候，这些声音严厉而指责，让她深陷于因幸存而获得的罪恶感之中。

These voices seemed different though. Small snatches of conversations filtered through to her foggy mind.

这些声音似乎有所不同。零星的对话片段穿透她朦胧的意识。

"…narcissistic personality disorder… "

…自恋型人格障碍…

" …mentally unstable…" ……精神不稳定……

"…history of violent outbursts…"

……有暴力爆发的历史……

The girl frowned but still seemed to be unable to open her eyes in this dream to see the person that was speaking, and whom it was that they were speaking about.

女孩皱着眉，似乎仍无法在这梦境中睁开眼睛，看清说话的人是谁，以及他们在谈论谁。

In her stupor she tried to reach out for the boy. Even on his catatonic state she had always found comfort in just holding him until the phantoms of her past had retreated.

在她的恍惚中，她试图伸手去触碰那个男孩。即便他处于木僵状态，她总能从握着他的手中找到安慰，直到过去的幻影退去。

All her reaching hand found were cold metal bars that seemed to be blocking her access to the boy. Her arms felt restricted somehow, trapped and prevented from reaching out, cruelly blocked from finding her source of comfort.

她伸出的手所触及的，只有冰冷的金属栏杆，仿佛阻挡了她接近男孩的去路。她的双臂感到一种束缚，被困住了，无法伸出，被无情地阻隔在寻找慰藉的源头之外。

Asuka frowned further and let out a small moan. "Shinji…"

明日香眉头皱得更深，发出了一声轻微的呻吟。“真嗣……”

The voices paused in their dissection.

声音在剖析中暂停了。

"Senpai, I think that she's beginning to come around!"

前辈，我觉得她开始有所觉悟了！

Suddenly a strong hand grabbed hold of Asuka's face, two hard fingers holding her right eye open. A painfully bright light flooded her vision, causing her to whimper quietly. She tried to bring her hands up to her face to protect them from the assault, but again her arms were restricted by tight bonds at her wrists.

突然，一只强有力的手抓住了明日香的面部，两根坚硬的手指撑开她的右眼。一道刺眼的光芒涌入她的视线，令她不由自主地轻声呜咽。她试图抬起双手遮挡这突如其来的侵袭，但手腕上的紧绷束缚再次限制了她的行动。

As quickly as the attack started it was gone. Darkness, with the greenish ghost of the light still in her eye, returned to her World.

攻击来得快去得也快。黑暗中，那道光留下的绿色残影仍在眼前，她的世界又恢复了平静。

"No, she's still out of it. The sedative we gave her should keep her under for another couple of hours. She's probably just dreaming."

不，她还没醒。我们给她的镇静剂应该能让她再睡上几个小时。她可能只是在做梦。

"The poor thing." The other, gentler voice answered. "It seems so cruel what we do to these kids."

可怜的孩子。" 另一个更温柔的声音回答道，"我们这样对待这些孩子，似乎太残忍了。

"They're not just kids, Maya. They represent an enormous investment in money and manpower. We have to keep them as pliable and functional as possible. The whole of this project relies upon them being able to perform when and where required!"

他们不仅仅是孩子，玛雅。他们代表着巨大的金钱和人力投入。我们必须让他们尽可能保持顺从和高效。整个项目都依赖于他们能够在需要的时候和地点执行任务！

"I know that, Senpai." Said the other voice, growing softer as Asuka could sense the speakers moving away from her. "It-it just seems unfair."

我明白，前辈。"另一个声音说道，随着飞鸟能感觉到说话者正离她远去，声音也变得柔和。"只是这似乎不公平。

"It's not important." Said the harder voice with impatience. "While she can perform, we'll use her. If's she's damaged, we'll have to find another. That's just the way it has to be. You can't afford to be blinded by sentiment."

“这不重要。”那个更严厉的声音不耐烦地说道，“只要她还能表演，我们就用她。如果她损坏了，我们就得另找他人。事情就是这样，你不能被感情蒙蔽了双眼。”

"I suppose that you're right…"

我想你是对的……

"You know that I am. Have her brought to the second examination room when she wakes up."

你知道我是谁。等她醒来后，把她带到第二个检查室。

"Yes Senpai." 好的，前辈。

The sound of a door opening and closing cut off the speakers from the girl's hearing. Eventually she stopped fighting against the weight of her being and drifted back into unconsciousness.

开门和关门的声音切断了女孩对讲话者的听觉。最终，她停止了与自身重量的抗争，再次陷入昏迷。

Second Examination Room. NERV Biological Research Wing. Central Dogma.

第二检查室。NERV 生物研究翼。中央教条。

"This couldn't have been done back at the Infirmary?"

这事儿不能在医务室就办了吗？

Nothing. 没什么。

"Heh… Well, less witnesses this way I guess."

呵……嗯，这样大概目击者就少一些了。

Still no response. 仍然没有回应。

"So why, apart from your own personal predilections of course, do most of your 'examinations' seem to require being as naked as a jaybird and trussed up like a Christmas goose?" Asuka was feeling seriously pissed off that this was her welcome back to her old life.

那么，除了你个人的偏好当然之外，为什么你的大多数“检查”似乎都需要像一只裸体的松鸦一样赤裸，并且像圣诞鹅一样被捆绑起来呢？" 明日香对于这种迎接她重返旧生活的方式感到非常恼火。

The blonde Doctor just grunted in annoyance at the mixed avian simile and continued her examination. In desperation for a response of some kind Asuka looked over at Doctor Akagi's young assistant, who was studiously focused on the readout monitors and avoiding looking at the naked German girl.

金发医生对那个混杂的鸟类比喻不满地哼了一声，继续她的检查。出于某种回应的迫切需要，明日香看向赤木博士的年轻助手，后者正专心致志地盯着读数监视器，避免看向裸体的德国女孩。

"Do you get off on this kind of stuff?"

"你对这种事情感到兴奋吗？"

"I… " Maya answered, looking up at her briefly before blushing and quickly ducking her head back down to the screen.

"我……" 玛雅回答道，抬头短暂地看了她一眼，随即脸颊泛红，迅速低头重新看向屏幕。

" 'Cos if you do, I'm more than willing to swap places with you and… Ahhh! Geez Doc, not so rough! Don't you know that oral thermometers have been the medical standard since Second Impact?"

因为如果你这么做，我非常愿意和你交换位置，然后……啊！天哪，医生，别那么粗鲁！难道你不知道自从第二次冲击以来，口腔温度计一直是医疗标准吗？

"Temperature within acceptable norms." The Doctor said.

"温度在可接受范围内。" 医生说道。

"Yes Ma'am." Replied Maya entering more data.

"好的，女士。" 玛雅回答道，同时输入更多数据。

Asuka's blood was beginning to boil at the constant lack of regard that the two women were giving her. She knew that the peon at the monitors was innocent enough, but the Blonde doctor… Asuka frowned. She knew now that the bitch was almost as culpable in NERV's plotting as Gendo was. The high and mighty Doctor Ritsuko Akagi had been up to her ears in the plans to initiate Third Impact and the rest of the Commander's twisted plan ever since the "Tragic" demise of the even more brilliant Naoko Akagi.

明日香的怒火开始沸腾，因为那两位女性始终对她漠不关心。她知道监控前的那个小角色是无辜的，但那位金发医生……明日香皱起了眉头。她现在明白，这个贱人在 NERV 的阴谋中几乎和源渡一样有罪。自那位更加杰出的直子·赤木“悲剧性”逝世以来，高高在上的赤木律子博士就一直深陷于引发第三次冲击及指挥官其他扭曲计划的阴谋之中。

Asuka's frown deepened into a scowl. 'Let's not forget,' She thought to herself. 'That after Mommy Dearest went of the high dive she took her place in the Commander's bed faster than you can say Electra Complex!'

明日香的眉头紧锁成怒容。'别忘了，'她暗自思忖，'自从亲爱的妈妈从高台跳下后，她取代其位置躺在指挥官的床上，速度之快，你连说个恋父情结都来不及！'

The Second Child's mounting anger and frustration went unnoticed by the two scientists. Asuka had to bite her lip as Ritsuko now examined her most private of areas.

第二孩子的愤怒和挫败感未被两位科学家察觉。明日香不得不咬住嘴唇，因为律子现在正在检查她最私密的部位。

"Note that the subject is still a virgin." The doctor said in an offhand manner to her assistant.

医生漫不经心地对助手说：“注意，这个对象还是个处女。”

"Yes Ma'am." 是的，女士。

"Why wouldn't I still be a virgin?" Asuka asked through clenched teeth.

"为什么我就不能还是个处女呢？" 明日香咬紧牙关问道。

Finally Ritsuko met her eyes. "I need to cover every possibility Asuka." The blonde scientist said to Asuka as if she were explaining something simple to a very stupid child. "Your behaviour today was out of the ordinary. I am required to ensure that nothing has happened to you that would jeopardise your ability to pilot."

最终，律子与明日香对视，“我必须考虑到所有可能性，明日香。”金发科学家对明日香说道，仿佛在向一个非常愚蠢的孩子解释一件简单的事情，“你今天的行为非同寻常。我有责任确保你没有发生任何可能危及你驾驶能力的事情。”

"So you're saying that I can't pilot Eva if I've had sex?"

“那你的意思是，如果我有过性行为，就不能驾驶 Eva 了？”

Doctor Akagi sucked her teeth in annoyance. "That would be highly unlikely. But having had sexual relations with another pilot may have a serious impact on both of your mental states. If that were the case, we would need to monitor that closely."

阿卡吉医生不悦地咂了咂嘴。“那可能性极低。但与另一位飞行员发生性关系可能对你们双方的心理状态产生严重影响。如果真是这样，我们就需要密切监控。”

"With another Pilot?" Asuka asked in a dangerously low voice. "What would make you think that I have had, or would have sex with Shinji?"

"和另一个飞行员？"明日香用危险低沉的声音问道，"你凭什么认为我和真嗣有过，或者会有性关系？"

"Shinji would be the most likely candidate." The doctor answered matter-of-factly. "You live under the same roof, under the care of a lax and often absent guardian. You share almost all of your waking hours together. There's the added allure that his Father is the Commander of NERV and therefore one of the most powerful men on the Planet, and lastly… You were calling out his name in your sleep mere hours ago as you lay unconscious in the NERV infirmary." She finished with a triumphal smirk.

"最有可能的人选是真嗣。" 医生实事求是地回答道，"你们同住一个屋檐下，由一个疏于照顾且经常不在的监护人照看。你们几乎所有醒着的时间都在一起。再加上他的父亲是 NERV 的指挥官，因此是地球上最有权势的人之一，最后……就在几小时前，你在 NERV 医务室昏迷不醒时，还在睡梦中呼唤着他的名字。" 她带着胜利的微笑结束了这番话。

Asuka was seething at the woman's words. "You would think that, Doctor Akagi." She spat out, her anger at the insinuations overriding her caution. "I know that's the way your mind works… Just like poor old Mommy dearest!" She saw Ritsuko's eyes go wide. "But I don't work that way, do you understand? But I will tell you one thing…" Asuka continued, unable to resist the urge to drive the dagger of truth home. "If I ever do change my mind and want to get advice on fucking an Ikari, I'll sure know who to come to!"

明日香对那女人的话怒火中烧。“你当然会这么想，赤木博士。”她愤愤地吐出这些话，愤怒压过了她的谨慎。“我知道你就是这样思考的……就像可怜的老妈一样！”她看到律子的眼睛瞪大了。“但我不是那样的人，你明白吗？不过我要告诉你一件事……”明日香继续说道，忍不住要把真相的利刃刺得更深。“如果我哪天真的改变主意，想要咨询如何与一个碇家的人上床，我肯定会知道该找谁！”

SLAP 源文本：SLAP 翻译文本：掌掴

The sound of Ritsuko's open hand smacking Asuka's face echoed in the tiny examination room. Asuka could hear Maya gasp over the ringing in her ears.

律子手掌击打明日香脸颊的声音在狭小的检查室内回荡。明日香耳边嗡嗡作响，仍能听见玛雅倒吸一口凉气的声音。

"Look here you cocky little bitch!" The Doctor snarled just inches from her face. "Don't go talking big about things you don't understand! You think you're so untouchable just because you're the pilot of an Eva? Let me tell you something, little girl. You are just about the most replaceable person in this whole organisation! You hear me? Compared to The First and Third Children you're really nothing more than a spare!"

"瞧你这嚣张的小贱人！" 医生咆哮着，脸几乎贴到她的脸上。"别在那儿大放厥词，对不懂的事情指手画脚！你以为自己是 Eva 的驾驶员就高不可攀了？告诉你，小丫头。你在这整个组织里是最可有可无的人！听见了吗？跟第一和第三适格者比起来，你不过是个备胎！"

Asuka smiled. She knew that she must have really touched a nerve in the good doctor. Clearly Ritsuko thought that this would be the best way to hurt her. In the past it would have probably been enough to break her completely. But to a girl that had been ripped apart by the Mass Production Evangelions, survived the Horrors of Third Impact and managed to scrape out a living amongst the privations of the post Impact World, a few spiteful words from someone as damaged and guilt ridden as Ritsuko Akagi were almost meaningless.

明日香微笑着。她知道自己的话肯定触到了那位好医生的痛处。显然，律子认为这是伤害她的最佳方式。在过去，这或许足以彻底击垮她。但对于一个曾被量产型福音战士撕裂、挺过第三次冲击的恐怖并设法在冲击后的世界艰难求生的人来说，像赤木律子这样心灵受创、满怀愧疚之人的几句恶言，几乎毫无意义。

"Yeah, well… Thanks for the insight Doc. Can I go home now?"

嗯，好吧……谢谢你的见解，医生。我现在可以回家了吗？

The scientist's flushed face stared blankly at her for a few seconds.

科学家涨红的脸茫然地盯着她看了几秒钟。

"Senpai?" Came Maya's shell shocked voice from the other side of the room.

"前辈？" 房间另一头传来玛雅震惊的声音。

Finally Ritsuko seemed to come back to her senses. She took a step back and took off her glasses. "We're done here." She snapped. Throwing her examination gloves in the yellow trash bin.

最终，律子似乎回过神来。她后退一步，摘下眼镜，厉声说道：“我们这里结束了。”随后将检查手套扔进了黄色垃圾桶。

"Great. Now where are my clothes?"

很好。现在我的衣服在哪里？

Maya handed her a blue plastic bag with her crumpled school uniform in it. The young tech then quickly shut down the monitors and other equipment before bowing to Dr Akagi and exiting the room.

玛雅递给她一个装着皱巴巴校服的蓝色塑料袋。这位年轻的技术员迅速关闭了监视器和其他设备，然后向赤木博士鞠了一躬，离开了房间。

"Major Katsuragi will pick you up from the main foyer in twenty minutes." Ritsuko said distastefully as the girl quickly dressed herself. "There's nothing physically wrong with you. You may attend school tomorrow as usual."

"葛城少校二十分钟后会在主大厅接你。" 律子不悦地说道，女孩迅速穿好衣服。"你身体上没什么问题，明天可以照常上学。"

Asuka finished dressing and stood looking at the Doctor.

明日香穿好衣服后，站在那里看着医生。

"I'll be keeping an eye on you Second Child. Don't fuck up."

我会盯着你的，老二，别搞砸了。

"I'm flattered." Asuka replied with a small bow.

"过奖了。" 明日香微微鞠了一躬回答道。

Ritsuko stared at her for a second before turning on her heel and quickly leaving. Asuka was now alone in the room.

律子盯着她看了一秒，然后转身迅速离开。现在，明日香独自一人在房间里。

She sighed and ran her hands through her soft red hair.

她叹了口气，双手穿过她那柔软的红色秀发。

"Nice going Asuka!" She said to herself. "Too many more encounters like that one and they're gonna feed me to the Rei clones!" She shuddered at the thought. She used to be so scared of the Great Ritsuko Akagi. Third Impact had effected her feelings about a great many things. She now knew the Scientist for what she was, a damaged shell with Mommy issues. She found it almost impossible to respect, let alone fear the woman now.

"干得好，明日香！" 她自言自语道。"再遇到几次那样的遭遇，他们就要把我喂给绫波复制人了！" 想到这里，她不禁打了个寒颤。她曾经非常害怕伟大的赤木律子博士。第三次冲击影响了她对许多事物的感受。现在她看清了这位科学家的真面目，一个有着母亲情结的破损外壳。她发现几乎不可能再尊重，更别提害怕这个女人了。

Asuka left the tiny room, trying to slough off the weight of the unpleasantness that had gone on there. What had been said couldn't be unsaid, she'd have to live with that. Hopefully she hadn't done too much damage to her cause before she had even started.

明日香离开了那个狭小的房间，试图摆脱在那里发生的不愉快所带来的沉重感。已经说出的话无法收回，她必须承受这一切。希望在她真正开始之前，没有对她的目标造成太大的伤害。

No, she didn't fear Ritsuko or the Commander anymore. She had beaten them all before, and she would again if she had to. Now, though, a butterfly of fear began fluttering madly in her stomach. Now she would have to face what she really feared in this World. The one thing that she had been both dreading and anticipating since she had woken up.

不，她不再害怕律子或指挥官了。她以前都战胜过他们，如果需要，她还会再次胜利。然而现在，一种恐惧的蝴蝶开始在她胃里疯狂扑腾。现在她必须面对这个世界上她真正害怕的东西。自从她醒来后，她既害怕又期待的那件事。

Now she was going home.

现在她正回家去。

The darkened city sped by through the blue Alpine A310's windows.

昏暗的城市透过蓝色阿尔派恩 A310 的车窗飞速掠过。

Misato Katsuragi looked across at her young charge with genuine concern. She knew that Asuka was under an enormous amount of stress. They all were. But what she had heard of the girl's outburst at school earlier in the day plus the obvious venom in Ritsuko's voice when she had rung Misato to say that Asuka was ready to be picked up from NERV showed her that Asuka was feeling the pressure way more than she had realised.

葛城美里带着真切的关心望向她年轻的被监护人。她知道明日香承受着巨大的压力。他们所有人都是如此。但当天早些时候在学校听到的女孩的爆发，以及律子在电话中告诉美里明日香已准备好从 NERV 接走时声音中明显的恶意，都表明明日香感受到的压力远超她所意识到的。

"Hey Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"You sure that you're doing okay?"

"你确定你还好吗？"

"Mmm." The Second Child replied noncommittally.

"嗯。" 第二适格者不置可否地回应道。

Misato's worry levels spiked even higher. In all of the years that she had known the redhead, she had never seen her so flat, so unresponsive. Asuka could always be relied upon for a pithy remark, an emotional outburst, or even the occasionally insightful analysis. Now it was almost as if the girl didn't know what to say, or maybe didn't care enough to be bothered to speak at all. For the whole trip home thus far the German girl had just stared out of the car's window. Seemingly transfixed by the bright lights and late night crowds of young couples gathered around the restaurants, grey suited salarymen packing the pachinko parlours, ramen stands and the rowdy Karaoke bars that always did a roaring trade of an evening in Tokyo-3.

美里愈发担忧。在与这位红发女孩相识的这些年里，她从未见过她如此消沉、毫无反应。明日香总能给出尖锐的评论、情绪的爆发，甚至偶尔有深刻的见解。而现在，她几乎像是不知道该说什么，或者根本不在乎到懒得开口。回家的路上，这位德国女孩一直凝视着车窗外的景象。似乎被东京-3 夜晚的璀璨灯光和熙攘人群所吸引：餐馆旁聚集的年轻情侣、身着灰色西装的上班族挤满弹珠机店、拉面摊和生意兴隆的卡拉 OK 酒吧。

Misato decided to try another tack. "You know Shinji has been really worried about you?"

碇真嗣一直很担心你，你知道吗？

Finally Asuka turned towards her. "He has?" She asked. Her voice showing some real emotion for the first time since Misato had picked her up from the Infirmary.

最终，明日香转向了她。“他真的这么说了？”她问道。这是自美里从医务室接她以来，她的声音第一次流露出真实的情感。

"Of course!" Misato replied. "You know that he cares a lot about you? We both do. I think that you really scared him today!"

"当然啦！" 美里回答道，"你知道他很在乎你吧？我们都是。我觉得你今天真的把他吓到了！"

The redhead's eyes shone with concern for a second before her face returned to its previous flat expression. "Yeah, well… He'll live." She said dully before returning her gaze to the outside World.

红发女子的眼中闪过一丝关切，但很快她的表情又恢复了之前的平淡。“嗯，他死不了。”她无精打采地说完，目光再次投向了外面的世界。

Misato sighed to herself and left it at that. The rest of the trip to the apartment building took place within the grip of an uncomfortable silence.

碇真嗣在心里叹了口气，就此作罢。前往公寓楼的剩余路程，笼罩在一种令人不适的沉默之中。

As the car rounded the final corner before the entry to the building's parking garage Asuka finally spoke up.

当车子绕过进入大楼停车场前的最后一个拐角时，明日香终于开口了。

"M-Misato…" The girl said nervously. "Could you please stop here?"

"M-Misato…" 女孩紧张地说道，"你能在这里停一下吗？"

The Major pulled to a halt just across from the entrance.

少校在入口对面停下了车。

"What for Asuka?" She asked puzzled by the apparent anxiety in her voice.

"为了什么，明日香？" 她困惑地问道，显然从她的声音中听出了焦虑。

"Just let me out here Misato!" The redhead responded. "I-I don't wanna go in there!" She seemed to be staring at the darkened entrance to the garage as if it were the maw of some terrifying beast.

"就让我在这里下车吧，美里！" 红发女孩回应道。"我...我不想进去！" 她似乎正盯着车库那昏暗的入口，仿佛那是某种恐怖野兽的巨口。

"But it's the only way to the lifts. I'll just park the old girl in my usual spot and we'll be upstairs in just a few minutes!"

但这是通往电梯的唯一路径。我会把这位老女士停在我常停的地方，我们很快就能上楼了！

"No!" Asuka replied, opening the passenger door. "I… I'll take the stairs! I just can't go in this way right now… sorry!" Before Misato could say anything else the girl was out of the car and had slammed the door shut behind her.

"不！"明日香回答道，打开了乘客座的车门。"我……我要走楼梯！我现在真的没办法这样进去……对不起！"在葛城还没来得及说别的之前，女孩已经下了车，并砰的一声关上了车门。

Shaking her head as she guided the old Alpine into the car park Misato could feel the small butterfly of concern for Asuka in the pit of her stomach quickly transform into a circling kettle of vultures.

当她驾驶着那辆老旧的阿尔派车进入停车场时，美里摇了摇头，感到胃里对明日香的那一丝担忧迅速化作了一群盘旋的秃鹫。

'I think that you discharged her a little to early Ritsuko!' Misato thought to herself on the solitary lift ride up to her floor. As she left the lift and approached her apartment she could see a lonely figure standing by the doorway slightly bent over with hands on knees.

“我觉得你让律子走得有点太早了，Ritsuko！” 在独自乘坐电梯上楼的过程中，美里暗自思忖。当她离开电梯，走近自己的公寓时，可以看到一个孤独的身影站在门口，微微弯着腰，双手撑在膝盖上。

"How did you get up here so quick?"

"你怎么这么快就上来了？"

"Stairs." Was the breathless reply.

"楼梯。" 是气喘吁吁的回答。

"You ran up seven flights of stairs in that time?" Misato asked incredulously.

"你在这段时间里跑了七层楼梯？" 美里难以置信地问道。

"Uh-huh." Asuka panted. "嗯哼。" 明日香喘着气。

"Why didn't you just come with me in the lift?"

"你为什么不直接和我一起乘电梯呢？"

The girl just stared at her and didn't answer.

女孩只是盯着她，没有回答。

Misato shrugged and entered the code to unlock the door. "You didn't have to wait for me, you know, you should've just gone in." She said over her shoulder as she stepped through the door, kicked off her shoes, and walked into the apartment.

碇真嗣耸了耸肩，输入密码打开了门。“你不必等我的，知道吗，你应该直接进去。”她边说边穿过门，踢掉鞋子，走进了公寓。

She didn't see Asuka hesitate at the threshold, her eyes wide and breath coming in small gasps. The little panic attack she had suffered upon seeing the dark mouth of the building's parking garage had been unexpected. She had thought that she was stronger than that. The blind effort of sprinting up the stairs to this level had helped clear her head of that terror a little. Still, cross the threshold of Misato's apartment felt like breaching a point from which she would never be able to return. She looked down to see that her hands were shaking uncontrollably.

她没有看到明日香在门槛处犹豫，双眼睁大，呼吸急促。在看到建筑停车场黑暗入口时所经历的小恐慌发作出乎意料。她本以为自己比那更坚强。拼命跑上楼梯到达这一层，多少帮助她从那种恐惧中清醒了一点。然而，跨过美里公寓的门槛，感觉就像突破了一个无法回头的点。她低头一看，发现自己的双手在不受控制地颤抖。

"This is fucking ridiculous!" She whispered to herself.

“这太荒唐了！”她自言自语道。

Clenching her fists and screwing her eyes shut she stepped across the boundary of the outside World and stood trembling in the small entryway of the Katsuragi household.

她紧握双拳，紧闭双眼，跨过了外界的界限，站在葛城家狭小的入口处，浑身颤抖。

She opened her eyes. "Tadaima." She said quietly.

她睁开眼睛，轻声说道：“我回来了。”

"Welcome home!" Came the shouted reply from the kitchen, startling her. She had forgotten about the Third Child's super sensitive hearing.

"欢迎回家！"厨房里传来高声的回应，让她吃了一惊。她忘了第三适格者那超常的听觉。

'Ikuhayo, Asuka!' She said to herself before she carefully took off her own shoes and walked into the apartment's living areas.

"Dinner will be ready in ten minutes!" Shinji said loudly as she entered the kitchen. He had his back turned to her, working away at the stove top. Misato had gone to her room to change out of her work clothes, so it was just her and Shinji in there at the moment. Asuka pulled back a chair and sat at the kitchen table. The scene before her was so familiar and domestic, and yet so impossible that she just sat there and stared at the Third Child's back for five whole minutes without saying a word.

"晚餐十分钟后就好！" 真嗣大声说着走进厨房。他背对着她，在炉灶前忙碌着。美里回房间换下工作服了，此刻只有她和真嗣两人在厨房。明日香拉出一把椅子，坐在餐桌旁。眼前的场景熟悉又家常，却又如此不可思议，她就这样静静地坐在那里，凝视着第三适格者的背影，整整五分钟一言未发。

Her mind was running a loop of the events of the last year… Her last year… of survival in the post Third Impact wastelands. She remembered standing of the beach holding the old rifle to her on that desolate shoreline . Then there was a jumble of unconnected images. Rei… Hikari… The Stooges…Then she had woken up to the warmth and brightness of the NERV Infirmary. Shortly following that she had been rather invasively probed and scanned by an increasingly hostile Dr Akagi and her nervous assistant… What was her name again? Maya? That was it, Maya. The one with the older brother who was killed in a car accident.

她的思绪不断回放着过去一年的种种事件……她那在第三次冲击后荒芜之地求生的岁月。她记得自己站在那荒凉的海岸边，手中紧握着那把老旧的步枪。接着，脑海中闪过一系列杂乱无章的画面：绫波、光、三个小丑……随后，她在 NERV 医务室温暖明亮的环境中醒来。不久，她便遭到了愈发敌意的赤木博士及其紧张助手的相当侵入性的检查和扫描……那个助手的名字又是什么来着？真夜？对，就是真夜。那个哥哥在车祸中丧生的女孩。

Wait… How the hell did she even know that?

等等……她到底是怎么知道的？

She leaned her head on her hands. That was right. Third Impact. That brief but excoriating mash up of the whole of Humanity's consciousness. Did that really happen? Was the whole thing just a product of her overstressed imagination. Did this meek fourteen year old boy in front of her now really become God for a moment, only to reject eternal oneness and reduce the Earth to a frozen dying wasteland?

她将头枕在手上。没错，第三次冲击。那是短暂却剧烈的人类意识大融合。这一切真的发生过吗？还是只是她过度紧张的想象产物？眼前这个温顺的十四岁男孩，真的曾一度成为上帝，却又拒绝永恒的合一，将地球变成一个冰冷垂死的荒原吗？

'No, it didn't happen, because it hasn't happened… yet.' She frowned 'That doesn't even make sense!'

不，那件事没发生，因为它还没发生……至少现在还没。”她皱起眉头，“这根本说不通！”

Maybe she really was losing her marbles?

或许她真的开始神志不清了？

'…only you have the power to influence Shinji and stop this World from dying. The best way to achieve this is to prevent it from having come into being in the first place.'

……唯有你拥有影响真嗣并阻止这个世界消亡的力量。最佳的实现方式是阻止其最初形成。

Lilith/Rei's words to her from the beach echoed suddenly in her mind

莉莉丝/绫波丽在海滩上对她说的话突然在她脑海中回响.

'What the fuck is that supposed to mean anyway?' She thought.

“这他妈到底是什么意思？”她心想。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She looked at her hands in front of her on the table. Her arms were clear and unscarred, the hands soft and fleshy. No blackened blisters from the frostbite or dry cracked knuckles here. It was too unreal. The image of herself in she carried and the one living in this World seemed irreconcilable in her mind.

她凝视着桌前自己的双手，手臂光洁无瑕，手掌柔软丰腴。没有因冻伤而生的黑痂，也没有干裂的指关节。这一切显得如此不真实。她心中所承载的自我形象与这个世界上生活的她，似乎在她脑海中无法调和。

"Asuka?" The voice asked again in a worried tone. She raised her head from her hands and looked, for the first time, into the deep blue worried eyes of Shinji Ikari. The Past and Future God and Destroyer of Worlds who stood before her wearing a dark green apron and pink oven mitts on his hands.

"明日香？" 那声音再次带着担忧的语气问道。她从双手中抬起头，第一次望进了真嗣·碇那双深蓝色的、充满忧虑的眼睛。这位既是过去与未来的神，又是世界的毁灭者，此刻正站在她面前，身着一件深绿色围裙，手上戴着粉色的隔热手套。

She said nothing in reply, she felt incapable of actually speaking at that time. She just stared dumbstruck at the boy that she had spent the last year of her life keeping alive, a boy who was now looking at her with deep concern in his eyes.

她没有回答，那一刻她感到自己无法开口。她只是目瞪口呆地盯着那个男孩，过去一年她竭尽全力让他活下来，而现在这个男孩正用充满关切的眼神望着她。

"Asuka," He repeated. "Are you okay?"

"明日香，" 他重复道，"你还好吗？"

Her mouth opened and shut a couple of times without any sound coming forth. Finally she managed to say something.

她的嘴巴张开又合上了几次，却没有任何声音发出。最终，她设法说出了些什么。

"Yep." She strangled out. "Just great…uh… how're you?"

"嗯。" 她艰难地说道，"真是太好了……呃……你怎么样？"

"Umm… Good thanks…" He replied nervously.

“呃……很好，谢谢……”他紧张地回答道。

'God, this is so awkward…' Was the thought that ran through both Children's minds simultaneously.

“天啊，这太尴尬了……”这个念头同时闪过两个孩子的心头。

They would probably have remained standing there, staring at each other and make excruciating small talk if not for the blessed arrival of their guardian and commanding officer into the kitchen at that moment.

如果不是他们的守护者和指挥官恰好在那一刻走进厨房，他们可能还会继续站在那里，互相凝视，进行着令人痛苦的无聊闲聊。

"Hey Shinji! That smells great!" Misato said, sweeping into the small room like a tornado in cut-offs. In one sweeping motion she had taken a beer from the refrigerator, cracked it open, sat down opposite Asuka and was in the process of draining the can before either of them could even acknowledge her presence.

"嘿，真嗣！这味道真棒！" 美里说着，像穿着短裤的旋风一样冲进小房间。她一气呵成地从冰箱里拿出一罐啤酒，打开，坐在明日香对面，还没等他们俩来得及注意到她，就已经开始大口喝起啤酒来了。

"Uh… Thanks Misato." Shinji replied, grateful to have an excuse to break the uncomfortable moment of eye contact with the Second Child.

“呃…谢谢你，美里。” 真嗣回答道，感激有一个借口来打破与第二适格者之间那令人不适的对视时刻。

Asuka shook herself mentally. She couldn't afford to just zone out right at this moment. She had to establish herself back in this World or she'd quickly arouse suspicions. Not just of Misato or her classmates either. Her little altercation with Dr Akagi had been a major error of judgement. She would have to have a lot more self control than that if she was going to succeed.

明日香在心里摇了摇头。她不能在这个节骨眼上走神。她必须在这个世界重新站稳脚跟，否则很快就会引起怀疑。不仅仅是美里或她的同学。她与赤木博士的小冲突是一个重大的判断失误。如果她想要成功，就必须有更强的自制力。

Still, Asuka could probably count herself lucky. Of all of the causes for her outbursts she doubted that her reacting to the stress of being sent back nearly two years from a post apocalyptic dead World was likely to even be on their list of possible reasons! Although she would have to be careful. She knew that if Ritsuko or anyone else suspected the slightest thing was out of place then Commander Ikari would likely know also. She knew all to well what he was capable of if he even suspected the slightest threat to his scenario.

尽管如此，明日香或许还算幸运。她怀疑，自己因从末日后荒芜的世界被送回近两年而产生的压力反应，甚至不太可能出现在他们列出的可能原因之中！虽然她必须小心行事。她清楚，如果律子或其他任何人察觉到一丝异常，那么碇司令很可能也会知晓。她深知，一旦他怀疑有任何威胁其计划的行为，他会采取何种手段。

She shuddered to herself at the thought while her two housemates bickered meaninglessly around her. She knew that Rei/Lilith had tasked her with preventing Shinji from slipping into despair and basically destroying life as she knew it. What the ethereal being had failed to fill her in on was how exactly she was to achieve that end.

想到这里，她不由自主地打了个寒颤，而她的两个室友则在周围毫无意义地争吵着。她清楚，Rei/Lilith 赋予她的任务是阻止真嗣陷入绝望，从而避免她所熟知的生活被彻底摧毁。然而，这位超凡存在并未详细告诉她如何达成这一目标。

She looked at her fellow Evangelion Pilot as he continued to talk to Misato. 'Gott, he's so young!' She thought. Then again. So was she… now. She had seen him during Third Impact. She knew of the shitty hand that life had dealt him from the time he was four. She knew it all too well. The dead Mother, the dismissive and cold Father, the loneliness of a childhood spent in the care of disinterested adults. She had been playing from the same deck for her whole life as well. The difference was… What? What had turned him into the unresponsive shell that she had been dragging around post Impact Hakone for the last year of her life?

她看着与碇真嗣交谈的另一位福音战士驾驶员，心想：“天哪，他真年轻！”但转念一想，她自己又何尝不是呢？她曾在第三次冲击中见过他，深知他四岁起就遭遇的糟糕命运。她对此了如指掌：已故的母亲、冷漠的父亲、在冷漠成人照料下度过的孤独童年。她的一生也如同从同一副牌中抽取。不同的是……什么呢？是什么让他变成了她在冲击后的箱根拖着走了一年的那个毫无反应的躯壳？

She started as Shinji laughed at one of Misato's crude attempts at humour. His face captured her attention. It shone when he smiled. For the last year his affect had be flat and lifeless. Now, watching him smile and bicker with their guardian Asuka could almost feel that tears begin prickling at her eyes at the astonishing difference in the boy. The cares sloughed off him and he almost seemed transcendent to her.

她起初是因为真嗣嘲笑美里那拙劣的幽默尝试而笑了起来。他的脸吸引了她的注意。当他微笑时，那张脸熠熠生辉。在过去的一年里，他的情绪一直平淡无奇，毫无生气。现在，看着他和他们的监护人明日香斗嘴，她几乎能感觉到泪水开始刺痛她的眼睛，因为这个男孩的惊人变化。他的忧虑似乎都脱落了，他几乎在她眼中显得超凡脱俗。

This was the real Shinji. The one that had been killed off long before the horror of Third Impact. That would be her task. To preserve this boy that she saw before her from the ravages of what was to come.

这才是真正的真嗣。那个早在第三次冲击的恐怖之前就被扼杀的真嗣。那将是她的任务。保护眼前这个少年，使他免受即将到来的灾难的摧残。

'Oh shit…' She thought to herself as she thought of what the next few months would hold. 'I… I don't know how I'm gonna do this!'

“哦，糟糕…”她暗自思忖，想到接下来几个月的遭遇。“我…我不知道我该怎么熬过去！”

A light tapping at her leg brought her attention back to the present. She looked down at Pen-Pen as he pecked gently at her leg demanding attention, and probably fish. She ruffled his head feathers with her hand and he cooed with pleasure.

腿上传来的轻拍让她回过神来。她低头看向正在轻啄她腿要求关注，或许还有鱼的 Pen-Pen。她用手抚摸着它的头羽，它满足地咕咕叫着。

"Hey little guy." She said to the bird with real surprise and pleasure. "Long time no see!"

"嘿，小家伙。" 她对那只鸟儿说道，语气中带着真实的惊讶和喜悦。"好久不见了！"

The bird just tilted his head and squawked at her quizzically. She felt she could almost read his tiny avian mind. 'Less talk and more fish, Lady!' He seemed to say.

那只鸟只是歪着头，对她发出疑惑的叫声。她感觉自己几乎能读懂它那小小鸟儿的心思。'少说废话，多给点鱼，女士！' 它仿佛在说。

Asuka giggled at the thought. Which finally brought the attention of her two housemates back to her.

想到这里，明日香咯咯地笑了。这终于让她的两个室友的注意力重新回到了她身上。

"Hey, kiddo!" Misato said cheerfully. "You doing okay?"

"嘿，小家伙！" 葛城美里开心地说道，"你还好吗？"

Despite all of her swirling thoughts Asuka could feel a smile forming on her lips. She knew now she was with people, the only people in the World except maybe for Hikari of course, who knew her and cared for her. Just for who she was.

尽管脑海中思绪纷飞，明日香仍能感觉到嘴角上扬的微笑。她现在明白，自己正与那些人在一起，这世上除了或许还有光之外，唯一了解她并关心她的人。仅仅因为她是她自己。

"Yep," She answered. "I reckon that I am." The smile still plastered across her face.

"嗯，" 她回答道，"我想我是的。" 笑容依旧挂在她脸上。

"Glad to hear it." Misato answered before finishing her beer. The chair scraped on the linoleum floor as she stood up to go to the fridge and get another one.

"很高兴听到这个。" 碇真嗣回答道，随即喝完了手中的啤酒。她站起身，椅子在油毡地板上刮擦出声，走向冰箱去拿另一瓶。

Asuka noticed that Shinji was still standing there, looking at her with a nervous smile on his face. She tilted her head at him in a was that she knew from years of experience was irresistibly kawaii.

明日香注意到真嗣还站在那里，脸上带着紧张的微笑看着她。她向他歪了歪头，这种动作她从多年的经验中知道，是让人无法抗拒的可爱。

"Yes, Shinji?" She asked.

"是的，真嗣？" 她问道。

He looked startled for a second, before the sound of Misato humming softly as she rummaged in the fridge for another can seemed to spur him into action.

他愣了一下，随后听到美里一边在冰箱里翻找另一罐饮料一边轻声哼唱，这声音似乎促使他行动起来。

"I-I'm glad that y-you're okay too, Asuka." He said blushing.

"我、我也为你没事感到高兴，明日香。" 他红着脸说道。

Asuka could feel the heat rising in her own face as they stared at each other. The silence in the room seemed overwhelming suddenly as even the sound of Misato questing for her next beer ceased.

明日香能感觉到自己的脸颊在彼此凝视中逐渐升温。房间里的寂静突然变得压倒一切，就连寻找下一罐啤酒的美里也停止了声响。

"Shinji…" Asuka replied, staring deeply into his deep blue eyes.

"真嗣……" 明日香回应道，深深凝视着他那深蓝色的眼睛。

"Y-Yes Asuka?" "是，是，明日香？"

"Your noodles are boiling over."

你的面条煮得溢出来了。

He frowned in confusion for a second. "What…? Ah crap!" he exclaimed as he quickly rushed back to the stovetop to turn the heat on the burners down.

他困惑地皱了下眉头，“什么……？啊，糟糕！”他惊呼一声，迅速冲回炉灶前，将炉火的温度调低。

"Was-was that just a 'moment'?" Misato said staring at the space that had been between the two pilots.

"那只是个'瞬间'吗？" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷说着，凝视着两位驾驶员之间曾存在的空间。

Asuka started out of her reverie and looked up at where her guardian was standing.

明日香从沉思中回过神来，抬头望向她的守护者所在之处。

"Maybe… " Was all that she said.

“或许……”她只说了这么一句。

Asuka groaned as she flopped backwards onto her bed.

明日香呻吟着，向后一倒，瘫在了自己的床上。

"Ahhh… Clean sheets and a full belly…" She sighed to the empty room. It had been so long since she had eaten a proper home cooked meal made with real fresh meat and vegetables. She groaned again as she felt her distended stomach. Misato and Shinji had been a little dumbfounded watching her inhale second and third helpings of the beef and soba noodle dish that he had prepared for them. It felt like it was the single most delicious meal that she had ever eaten in her entire life. She had even complimented the Third Child on his cooking, which had seen raised eyebrows and even a shared glance between her two housemates.

"啊……干净的床单和饱腹感……"她对着空荡荡的房间叹息道。已经很久没有吃到用真正新鲜的肉和蔬菜做的家常饭了。她再次呻吟，感受到自己鼓胀的肚子。看着她狼吞虎咽地吃下第二份和第三份牛肉荞麦面，真嗣和美里都有些目瞪口呆。那感觉就像这是她一生中吃过的最美味的一顿饭。她甚至称赞了第三适格者的厨艺，这让她的两位室友都扬起了眉毛，甚至交换了一个眼神。

Asuka barely noticed as she continued eating until there was no more food left to be served.

明日香几乎没有察觉，她继续吃着，直到没有食物剩下可上桌。

After Shinji had finished washing up they had all watched some television for an hour or so. Sprawled on their various cushions and watching some ridiculous game show where contestants dressed as prawns had to run past a man in a giant foam rubber chef suit for no readily apparent reason. Misato cheered loudly when one of the contestants was caught by the chef and flung bodily into a giant pot. The unreality of it made Asuka's head spin.

洗漱完毕后，真嗣和众人一起看了大约一个小时的电视。他们各自躺在垫子上，观看一个荒谬的游戏节目，参赛者装扮成大虾，毫无明显理由地要跑过一位身穿巨大泡沫橡胶厨师服的男子。当其中一名参赛者被厨师抓住并整个扔进一个大锅里时，美里大声欢呼。这种不真实感让明日香感到头晕目眩。

It was all too weird. Too… normal. Had the last nearly two years of her life actually happened? The horrors of that year seemed more real to the girl than what she was experiencing there in the lounge room of Misato's apartment. The snarling face of the bob-tailed wolf mere inches from her face as she had crushed the life from it with her bare hands. The smell of the old rifle as she had held it to her head, the dark muzzle somehow threatening and beckoning at the same time. These images all flashed in her mind vividly. Making Asuka feel a weird sense of disconnection with what her eyes and ears were telling her.

这一切太过诡异，又太过……正常。过去近两年的人生真的发生过吗？那一年的恐怖似乎比她在美里公寓客厅里所经历的更为真实。那只短尾狼咆哮的面孔近在咫尺，她用双手将其生命扼杀。老旧步枪的气味，当她将其抵在头上时，那黑暗的枪口既充满威胁又似在召唤。这些画面在她脑海中生动闪现，让明日香感到一种与眼前所见所闻的奇异脱节感。

She stood up suddenly, causing her housemates to look at her questioningly.

她突然站起来，让室友们疑惑地看向她。

"I'm going to take a bath." She announced and fled to the bathroom.

她宣布道：“我要去洗澡了。”随即逃也似地跑进了浴室。

The sheer blissful luxury of running hot water made her question for a second whether she actually had pulled the trigger on that beach and was now in heaven. She soaked in the tub for over an hour. Topping up the hot water every time the bath threatened to cool down on her.

热水带来的纯粹幸福奢华让她有一瞬间怀疑自己是否真的在那片海滩上扣动了扳机，现在身处天堂。她在浴缸里泡了一个多小时，每次水温即将下降时都会再加些热水。

As she soaked she tried her best to figure out exactly when she was in the pre-Impact time-line. Toji had been at school so it was before the 13th Angel, but beyond that she was at a complete loss to figure it all out.

她在浸泡时尽力回想自己究竟处于冲击前的时间线上的哪个时刻。因为冬二还在学校，所以这肯定是在第 13 使徒出现之前，但除此之外，她完全无法理清头绪。

Deciding eventually that the danger of turning into a prune was becoming too high she climbed out of the bath and briskly dried herself off with a large, clean fluffy towel. After she had finished she finally, and for the first time that day, braved a look in the mirror.

最终决定，变成干瘪老太婆的风险太高，她便爬出浴缸，用一条又大又干净又蓬松的毛巾麻利地把自己擦干。擦完后，她终于，也是那天第一次，鼓起勇气照了照镜子。

Asuka gasped at the healthy young girl that stared back out at her. No scars marked her body. There were no signs of the gruesome entry and exit wounds that had pitted her flesh before. The eyes of the girl were bright with vivid blue irises that shone in the fluorescent light of the bathroom. Her ribs and hip bones no longer protruded gauntly from beneath her skin. She marvelled at the transformation that had occurred in her appearance. Snapping herself out of it she picked up her old toothbrush and began to scrub her teeth.

明日香惊讶地看着镜中那个健康年轻的女孩回望着她。身上没有一丝疤痕，也没有了之前肉体上那些可怕的入口和出口伤口的痕迹。女孩的眼睛在浴室的荧光灯下闪烁着生动的蓝色虹膜。她的肋骨和髋骨不再从皮肤下突兀地凸出。她惊叹于自己外貌上的转变。回过神来，她拿起旧牙刷开始刷牙。

"Asuka, are you gonna be in there much longer? I need to use the can!" Came Misato's voice from the other side of the door, rudely interrupting her reverie.

"明日香，你还要在里面待很久吗？我得用洗手间了！" 门那边传来美里不耐烦的声音，粗鲁地打断了她的沉思。

Quickly Asuka rinsed her mouth out, wrapped one towel around her body and another around her hair and opened the door to reveal her slightly tipsy guardian standing leaning on the door jamb in front of her.

阿苏卡迅速漱了漱口，用一条毛巾裹住身体，另一条包住头发，然后打开门，只见她那略带醉意的监护人正斜倚在门框上，站在她面前。

"All done." She said. "Try not to miss the bowl in there!"

“全都弄好了。”她说，“试着别在里面错过碗哦！”

"Har-de-har-har!" Misato replied sardonically as she pushed past her into the bathroom and shut the door.

"哈哈哈！" 葛城美里嘲讽地回应着，从她身边挤进浴室并关上了门。

Asuka headed for her own room and slid the door shut behind her.

明日香走向自己的房间，随手将门滑上。

The luxurious feeling of putting on clean a clean fresh long cotton t-shirt for sleeping in left her feeling almost light-headed and she flopped down on her bed sighing with contentment at the long forgotten sensations of a full stomach and settling down in a clean, comfortable bed. She lay there staring at the ceiling for what could have been an hour before she eventually Asuka heard Misato and Shinji bidding each other goodnight. Soon all was silent in the apartment as her two housemates slipped into the world of sleep.

穿上干净清爽的长棉 T 恤准备睡觉，那种奢华的感觉让她几乎感到头昏眼花，她倒在床上，满足地叹了口气，久违的饱腹感和躺在干净舒适的床上安顿下来的感觉涌上心头。她躺在那里，盯着天花板，可能过了一个小时，最终听到明日香和真嗣互道晚安。不久，公寓里一片寂静，她的两位室友都进入了梦乡。

No sleep would come to Asuka though. Despite the comfort and warmth of her bed she tossed and turned without rest ever coming any closer. After another hour she finally tossed her pillow across the room in frustration and got out of bed and walked to her bedroom door.

尽管床铺舒适温暖，明日香却辗转反侧，难以入眠。又过了一小时，她终于在沮丧中将枕头扔向房间另一头，起身下床，走向卧室门。

She opened the door a little and looked out. No sounds nor signs of life stirred within the silent apartment. She stepped out of her room and padded quietly down the hallway to the next siding door with its heart shaped sign designating it "Shinji's Lovely Suite". Asuka put her ear to the door and listened. No sound but the heavy breathing of slumber could be heard.

她微微推开门，向外张望。寂静的公寓内既无声音也无生命的迹象。她走出房间，轻手轻脚地沿着走廊来到下一个带有心形标志的滑动门前，上面写着“真嗣的可爱套房”。明日香将耳朵贴在门上倾听，除了沉睡中的沉重呼吸声外，别无他响。

Sliding the door open gingerly she stepped inside. Her heart was pounding loudly in her chest as she slowly walked until she was standing next to the small bed that lay next to the window in the sparsely furnished room.

她小心翼翼地推开门，走了进去。随着她缓缓走向房间里那张紧挨窗户的小床，她的心跳在胸腔中剧烈地跳动着。这个陈设简陋的房间里，一切都显得格外静谧。

In front of her lay the sleeping form of the Shinji Ikari. His breathing was steady and even, a gentle breeze from the open window ruffled his dark hair. Asuka smiled sadly to herself as she noticed a slight frown on his brow. Even in sleep it seemed the Third Child struggled to find peace.

在她面前躺着的是沉睡中的碇真嗣。他的呼吸平稳而均匀，从敞开的窗户吹来的微风轻拂着他乌黑的头发。明日香苦笑着注意到他眉间微皱。即使在睡梦中，这位第三适格者似乎也在努力寻找安宁。

"Poor Baka-Shinji." She whispered softly. The boy muttered in his sleep and rolled over, now facing away from her.

"可怜的笨蛋真嗣。" 她轻声细语道。男孩在睡梦中喃喃自语，翻了个身，现在背对着她。

"I-I don't know how I'm gonna do this Shinji." She said gently to the sleeping form. "I'm not sure I can face all of that again…" A tear rolled down the redhead's cheek. "But…I-I promise I won't let them destroy you th-this time. No matter what else I do. I promise that I'll make it better…" Asuka sniffed, causing the boy to shift uneasily in his bed. "Sleep tight Shinji-kun." She said gently leaning over him. A stray tear fell and splashed onto his face, Asuka turned and fled the room before her fears and emotions got the better of her.

"我...我不知道该怎么做到这一点，真嗣。" 她轻声对那沉睡的身影说道。"我不确定我能否再次面对所有那些..." 一滴泪水从红发女孩的脸颊滑落。"但是...我...我保证这次不会让他们摧毁你。无论我做什么，我保证我会让它变得更好..." 明日香抽泣着，让男孩在床上不安地动了动。"好好睡吧，真嗣君。" 她温柔地俯身对他说。一滴不慎落下的泪水溅在了他的脸上，明日香转身逃离了房间，生怕自己的恐惧和情感失控。

In his room Shinji Ikari awoke with the feeling that he had missed something vitally important. He looked around him and saw that the door to his bedroom was slightly ajar. Which was weird, as he always kept it closed of a night time. He put a hand to his cheek feeling an unexpected wetness there. A couple a drops of moisture clung to his finger. On an unexplainable impulse he put the finger to his lips. It tasted salty, but strangely sweet.

在他的房间里，碇真嗣醒来时有种感觉，仿佛错过了极其重要的事情。他环顾四周，发现卧室的门微微开着。这很奇怪，因为他晚上总是关着门的。他用手摸了摸脸颊，感到那里有意外的湿润。几滴水珠附着在手指上。出于一种难以解释的冲动，他将手指放到唇边。味道咸咸的，却又奇怪地带着甜味。

He got up and went to his door way and looked out into the apartment. No sign of movement could be seen in the darkened abode.

他起身走到门口，向外望向公寓内部。昏暗的居所中看不到任何动静的迹象。

He shut the door and went back to bed. It sure had been a weird day, but he was sure that things would get back to a more normal routine tomorrow.

他关上门，回到床上。今天确实很奇怪，但他确信明天一切都会恢复到更正常的日常。

Shinji rolled over onto his side and was soon off to sleep again. The lingering taste of salt on his lips did seem to lead him into some very strange dreams though.

真嗣翻身侧躺，很快又进入了梦乡。唇边残留的咸味似乎将他引入了一些奇异的梦境。

Back in her room Asuka struggled with the nagging fear of what the next morning would bring. She knew that from the moment that she woke up the next day she would have to try enact some kind of plan to keep the Third Child safe from the machinations of his Father and divert him from the path that Fate had chosen for him.

回到房间后，明日香挣扎于对次日早晨将带来什么的持续担忧中。她清楚，从第二天醒来那一刻起，她就必须设法制定某种计划，以保护第三适格者免受其父亲阴谋的伤害，并引导他偏离命运为他选定的道路。

"Great!" She muttered to herself. "One fourteen year old girl under almost constant surveillance has to thwart the plans of the most powerful men in history. Should be a piece of cake!"

"太棒了！"她自言自语道，"一个几乎时刻处于监视下的十四岁女孩，竟然要挫败历史上最有权势的男人们的计划。这简直是小菜一碟！"

Only the silence of the City at night answered her.

唯有夜晚城市的寂静回应着她。

"If I ever meet that Lilith/Rei thing again, I'm going to kick it's ethereal ass!"

如果我再碰到那个莉莉丝/绫波的东西，我一定要踢爆它的虚幻屁股！

Eventually the Second Child did manage to find some semblance of peace in slumber.

最终，次子确实在睡梦中找到了些许安宁。

End of Chapter 5. 第五章结束。

A/N: This chapter is kind of a bridging one in this story. So sorry if it was a little light on action and such. It was a very hard one for me to write. (I think it was karma getting back at me for saying that the previous chapter only took me one day to write!)

作者注：本章在故事中起到了承上启下的作用。如果动作场面较少，还请见谅。这一章对我来说写起来非常困难。（我想这可能是因果报应，因为我说过上一章我只用了一天就写完了！）

Any feedback is always gratefully received!

任何反馈都始终受到衷心感谢！

Thanks as always for reading.

一如既往，感谢您的阅读。

Cheers! 干杯！

Chapter 6: You Are Here

第 6 章：你在这里

A/N: As usual, I have to apologise for how long I've taken to get this next chapter up. Christmas craziness combined with a bit of a funk, for want of a better term, kinda threw the creative anchor out for a few weeks there.

作者注：一如既往，我必须为这么久才更新下一章而道歉。圣诞节的疯狂加上一点情绪低落，用更好的词来说，就是让创作的锚抛锚了几周。

That's behind me for now, so hopefully more frequent updates to follow. No promises this time though, as I'm worried that the guilt of breaking said promises could become habit forming!

那件事现在已成过去，希望接下来能有更频繁的更新。不过这次不作承诺，因为我担心违背承诺的负罪感可能会形成习惯！

So here it is, chapter 6 of Unbroken. Enjoy!

这就是了，《Unbroken》的第六章。尽情享受吧！

## Chapter 6 You Are Here

The sea looked like it had started to congeal since last she stood on its ragged shoreline. In the distance the massive and ghastly visage of Rei Ayanami protruded from the rank waters, no doubt adding its own putrefaction to the atmosphere of death and decay on the planet.

自从她上次站在那参差不齐的海岸线上以来，大海似乎已经开始凝固。远处，绫波丽的巨大而可怕的面容从浑浊的水中凸现出来，无疑为这个星球上死亡和腐朽的氛围增添了自己的腐败气息。

The girl saw that once again she was naked. The vile scars and fissures of her body standing out on her pale skin like contours on a map of her psyche.

女孩发现，自己又一次赤身裸体。她苍白肌肤上的可憎疤痕和裂痕，如同她心灵地图上的轮廓般显眼。

"Oh, you have got to be fucking with me!" Asuka said in disbelief.

"哦，你一定是在跟我开玩笑吧！" 明日香难以置信地说。

"I do not understand this metaphor Second Child. I have not attempted any form of physical contact between us at this time."

我不明白这个比喻，第二适格者。我此刻并没有尝试与我们之间进行任何形式的肢体接触。

She turned around to face the speaker. The pale form of Rei/Lilith stood once again beside her on the beach, her deep crimson eyes regarded her expectantly.

她转过身来面对说话者。苍白的身影，即丽/莉莉丝，再次站在她旁边的海滩上，她那深红色的眼睛期待地注视着她。

"What the Hell am I doing here?" Asuka asked angrily.

"我到底在这里干什么？" 明日香愤怒地问道。

"I do not wish for you to feel that I have completely abandoned you on your current plane of existence. I observe and advise where I feel that I am able to."

我不希望你感觉到我已完全抛弃了你在这个世界的旅程。我会在我认为能够提供帮助的地方观察并给出建议。

"Great, why don't you go and observe and advise Shinji to smack his Old Man upside his head with Unit One and cheer the fuck up while you're at it, it would save me a whole lot of time and effort!"

太好了，你何不去观察并建议真嗣用初号机给他老爸一巴掌，让他振作起来，这样能省我一大堆时间和精力！

Rei/Lilith narrowed her eyes in what could have been annoyance at Asuka's suggestion.

绫波/莉莉丝对明日香的提议眯起了眼睛，那表情可能是出于不悦。

"I cannot physically intervene in that plane of being, as I already exist there in another form. If I were to physically manifest in that world the paradox that would erupt from that moment could destroy me. Therefore I can only advise from outside of that plane. I do not as yet wish for destruction."

我无法在那个存在层面进行物理干预，因为我已经在那里以另一种形式存在。如果我在那个世界中以实体出现，由此产生的悖论可能会毁灭我。因此，我只能从那个层面之外提供建议。我目前还不希望引发毁灭。

"So instead you drag me back here looking like this? Thanks a bunch!"

所以你就这样把我拖回这里？真是太感谢了！

"This place and your current appearance are constructs of your own self image. I have merely sought to contact you within their boundaries to advise you on matters of importance."

此地及你当前的样貌，皆是你自我形象的构建。我仅是在这些界限内寻求与你联系，就重要事宜给予你建议。

"Terrific." Asuka said sarcastically. "Then can I ask you a couple of questions?"

"太棒了。" 明日香讽刺地说道，"那我能问你几个问题吗？"

"Of course." 当然。

"Why did you send me back to this point in time? Not that I'm even sure when it actually is yet. Why not send me back to the 'Over the Rainbow'? Then I could have surely made a bigger difference right from the get-go!"

你为什么把我送回这个时间点？我甚至还没搞清楚现在究竟是什么时候。为什么不把我送回《彩虹之上》呢？那样我肯定能从一开始就产生更大的影响！

"You have been sent to a point prior to events that may tip the balance in the development of the Third Child's descent into despair and desolation."

你已被派遣至一个时间点，此前的某些事件可能会影响第三子陷入绝望与荒凉的发展轨迹。

"Super." Asuka said dryly.

"太棒了。" 明日香干巴巴地说。

"I have decided to converse with you at this moment to tell you that time is growing short for trying to prevent such developments from occurring. You must not delay too much longer in your efforts in reaching the Third Child. In but a short time it may be too late."

我此刻决定与你交谈，是为了告诉你，试图阻止这些发展的时间已经不多了。你们在努力接触第三子的事情上，绝不能再过多拖延。不久之后，可能就为时已晚了。

"So you're telling me to 'Hurry up'?"

你是让我“快点”吗？

Rei/Lilith just stared at her.

绫/莉莉丝只是盯着她看。

"Let's get this straight. I only just got back and now you're telling me to hurry up!" Asuka said in annoyance. "Fine. Another thing. What was the big idea in sending me back right in the middle of class then? Everyone seems to think that I'm certifiably insane now!"

"咱们把话说清楚。我刚回来，你现在就催我快点！" 明日香不耐烦地说道，"行吧。还有，当时在上课时把我送回去是什么馊主意？现在大家都觉得我肯定是疯了！"

"I apologise." Rei/Lilith replied with what could almost be described as the ghost of a smirk. "It was not my intention to inconvenience you. I merely chose the moment that seemed best suited to your re-integration into your old life."

"我道歉。" 雷/莉莉丝回答道，脸上几乎带着一丝难以察觉的微笑。"我并非有意给您添麻烦。我只是选择了最适合您重返旧生活的时机。"

"Bullshit! You were just getting back at me for all of the times we used to fight when you were just plain old Wondergirl! Back before you were on this whole ethereal being kick that you're on now!"

"胡扯！你只是为了报复我们以前那些争吵，那时你还只是个普通的神奇女孩！在你现在沉迷于这种超凡脱俗的状态之前！"

"Think what you will, Pilot Soryu." Was the somewhat prim reply. "Though I feel that it would benefit you to treat my former self with more compassion than previously."

“随你怎么想，Soryu 驾驶员。”回答略显拘谨，“不过我觉得，你若能对我之前的自己多一些同情，或许对你更有益。”

"I'll consider it, but you're asking a lot of me already!"

我会考虑的，但你已经向我提出了很多要求了！

Once again the Angel/Human hybrid narrowed her eyes and looked at Asuka with what was definitely, in the German girl's opinion, an expression of annoyance.

天使/人类混血儿再次眯起眼睛，以一种在德国女孩看来无疑是恼怒的表情注视着明日香。

"We will talk again Second Child…" Rei/Lilith said as the ruined shoreline grew dark around her.

“我们还会再谈的，二号孩子……” 雷/莉莉丝说道，此时她周围的废墟海岸线渐渐暗了下来。

"Can't wait!" Asuka replied as the scene disappeared to be replaced by blackness and the distant sound of chalk on a blackboard. She opened her eyes and sat up from where she had been dozing at her desk.

"迫不及待了！" 明日香回答道，随即场景消失，取而代之的是一片漆黑，远处传来粉笔在黑板上的摩擦声。她睁开眼睛，从伏在桌上的小憩中坐起身来。

'Oh great,' She thought. 'Miss Arima's Art History class! At least I didn't miss anything important.'

“哦，太好了，”她心想，“有栖小姐的艺术史课！至少我没错过什么重要的内容。”

Miss Arima was the beret-clad-black-polo-neck-wearing-greying-fifty-something Art teacher. She had once, in her early twenties, toured the great Western art museums of Paris and the Vatican and had been so impressed that she had been inspired to spend the rest of her life sucking the life and joy out of the visual arts for successive generations of her students back in Japan.

有马小姐是那位戴着贝雷帽、身穿黑色高领衫、年过半百且头发渐白的艺术老师。她曾在二十出头时，游历了巴黎和梵蒂冈的西方艺术博物馆，深受震撼，从而立志余生在日本，将视觉艺术的生命与乐趣从一代又一代学生中汲取殆尽。

Needless to say that the interminable boredom of these classes caused many students to remember with fond nostalgia the Second Impact droning of their old Sensei.

毋庸置疑，这些课程无休止的枯燥让许多学生带着怀旧的温情回忆起他们昔日老师那如同第二次冲击般的单调讲授。

Asuka let her head fall listlessly back onto her folded arms. At least she should be able to catch up on some much needed sleep.

明日香无精打采地将头靠在叠起的胳膊上。至少她应该能补上一些急需的睡眠。

Asuka sat alone in the sunshine at one of the benches with a notepad on the table in front of her. From her vantage point she watched the interactions of her fellow classmates. It was like seeing all of them from a whole new perspective. The petty jealousies, politics and school-yard machinations of the 'popular' students. The awkward first bumbling steps of teenagers of the opposite sex attempting to communicate with each other. The group of third year boys that were strutting and scuffling with each other in front of another group of giggling girls. The disinterested gaze of the teacher on yard-duty scanning the quadrangle as she chastised a group of first year boys for throwing stones at each other. The whole scene had both a dynamism and a subliminal savagery that she had never noticed before.

明日香独自坐在阳光下的长椅上，面前桌上放着一本记事本。从她的有利位置，她观察着同学们的互动，仿佛从全新的视角审视着一切。那些受欢迎学生之间的小嫉妒、政治游戏和校园策略；异性青少年尝试交流时的笨拙第一步；一群三年级男生在另一群咯咯笑的女生面前炫耀和推搡；负责操场巡视的老师漫不经心地扫视着四方院，同时训斥一群互相扔石头的一年级男生。整个场景既充满活力，又隐含着她之前未曾注意到的野蛮。

She smiled a wry smile to herself. The last time she had sat out there she had been a vital part of it all. A driving force in the cliques and hierarchies of the schoolyard social order. Now she sat apart form it all and saw it for what it truly was. Meaningless window dressing on the struggle to survive.

她对自己苦笑了一下。上次她坐在那里时，还是这一切中不可或缺的一部分。是校园社交秩序中派系和等级制度的推动力。如今她置身事外，看清了这一切的真相。不过是生存斗争中无意义的装饰罢了。

The old saying that Civilisation is only ever three square meals away from anarchy was expounded by old men who had long forgotten the barbarism of their schooling, Asuka thought. The seeds of Humanity's fall appeared before her in her fellow students of the Tokyo-3 Middle School. Anarchy and violence it seemed were inborn characteristics. Humanity truly was a flawed species that would inevitably destroy itself the instant it gained that capability and happily remain well fed while it did so.

阿苏卡认为，那句老话“文明离无政府状态只有三顿饱饭之遥”是由那些早已忘记自己求学时期野蛮行径的老人们阐述的。人类衰落的种子在她东京第三中学的同学中显现出来。无政府状态和暴力似乎是与生俱来的特质。人类确实是一个有缺陷的物种，一旦获得那种能力，就会不可避免地自我毁灭，并在毁灭过程中心满意足地保持饱食。

Asuka shook her head to try and clear it of the dark path that her thoughts were taking her down and opened up her note book. The crisp white page reflected the sunlight blindingly into her squinting eyes. She needed a plan. Some kind of blueprint so that her actions would be less random and more purposeful in gaining the end she sought. She shuffled down to the more shaded end of the bench and sat with her pen poised over the blank page waiting for the ideas to flow.

明日香摇了摇头，试图摆脱那些将她引向黑暗深渊的思绪，随后打开了笔记本。洁白的纸张反射着刺眼的阳光，让她不由得眯起了眼睛。她需要一个计划，某种蓝图，以便她的行动不再那么随意，而是更有目的性地达成她所追求的终点。她挪到长椅上更阴凉的一端坐下，笔尖悬停在空白的纸页上，静待灵感的涌现。

Ten minutes later all that her page contained was several elaborate spirals and a super-deformed drawing of a rabbit.

十分钟后，她的页面上只剩下几个精美的螺旋图案和一个超级变形的兔子画。

Asuka growled in irritation and threw the pen back down on the table. She was getting nowhere. She stared back out at the schoolyard before her. The first year boys were now picking up papers from the ground under the inattentive supervision of the teacher on yard duty. Several of the Third year boys, seemingly given up on impressing the giggling group of girls, were now occupied dragging one of their number around the yard by his ankles. While other groups of students traveled in groups chattering to each other about what seemed to the German girl completely inconsequential things.

明日香烦躁地低吼一声，将笔重重地摔回桌上。她感觉自己毫无进展。她再次望向面前的校园，一年级的男生们正在老师的疏忽监督下，从地上捡起纸张。几个三年级的男生似乎放弃了吸引那群咯咯笑的女生，转而忙着拖着其中一个同伴在校园里绕圈，抓住他的脚踝。与此同时，其他学生群体结伴而行，互相闲聊着对这位德国女孩来说完全无关紧要的事情。

A flash of blue then caught her eye across the other side from where she sat. Homing in on it she made out the pale form of Rei Ayanami, satchel slung over her shoulder, making her way across the quadrangle completely oblivious to the students around her. She also noticed how, despite her unique appearance, the First Child was completely unregarded by her fellow students. No one looked, spoke to or even appeared to notice her pass amongst them like a ghost.

一抹蓝色突然吸引了她的目光，就在她所坐位置的对面。她定睛一看，辨认出了绫波丽的苍白身影，肩上挎着书包，正穿过四方院，对周围的学生浑然不觉。她还注意到，尽管绫波丽外貌独特，但这位第一适格者却完全被同学们忽视。没有人看她，与她交谈，甚至似乎没有人注意到她如幽灵般从他们中间经过。

No. She was wrong about that. Apart from her own, one other set of eyes followed the blue haired girl as she walked across the schoolyard and through the gateway and out of the school. In his usual spot, leaning against the library building wall between Aida and Suzuhara, she saw Shinji watch their fellow pilot walk by until a none too gentle whack on the back of the head and some unheard teasing by his friends made him blush and appear to sputter ineffectively against their taunts.

不，她错了。除了她自己，还有另一双眼睛注视着那个蓝发女孩穿过校园，经过大门，离开了学校。在平常的位置，倚靠在图书馆大楼的墙边，介于 Aida 和 Suzuhara 之间，她看到真嗣目送着他们的同僚飞行员走过，直到一个不太温柔的拍头和一些未被听见的来自朋友的调侃让他脸红，似乎无力地反驳着他们的嘲弄。

Asuka smiled seeing Shinji with his friends. She had failed to see in her past life how he relied on them for some semblance of normalcy in his life. In some ways she envied him that.

看到真嗣与朋友们在一起，明日香微笑了。她过去未曾意识到，在前世中，真嗣是多么依赖他们来维持生活中的些许正常。在某种程度上，她对此感到羡慕。

Seeing her fellow pilots like that she decided to try again with her planning. Like all good planners, she started by listing what she knew about the important players in Shinji's life. Specifically starting with the three Evangelion pilots themselves.

看到她的同伴飞行员们那样，她决定再次尝试制定计划。像所有优秀的策划者一样，她从列出她所了解的关于真嗣生活中重要人物的信息开始。特别是从三位福音战士驾驶员本身开始。

After a couple of short minutes writing she looked at what she had written:

经过短短几分钟的书写后，她看了看自己写下的内容：

Shinji Ikari: Troubled shy boy with Father Issues (she felt that it had needed capitalisation) and low self esteem. Through the mechanism of Third Impact becomes God. Rejects godhood and destroys world.

碇真嗣：一个因父子问题（她觉得这里需要大写）和自卑感而困扰的害羞男孩。通过第三次冲击的机制成为神。拒绝神性并毁灭世界。

Rei Ayanami: Artificial human. Socially inept to extreme degree. Instrument of divine will and trigger of Human Instrumentality who places God like powers in the hands of Shinji Ikari thereby enabling him to reject Instrumentality and destroy world.

绫波丽：人造人。社交能力极度欠缺。作为神意的工具和人类补完计划的触发者，将神一般的力量赋予碇真嗣，使他得以拒绝补完计划并摧毁世界。

Me: Girl who pisses both of them off.

我：让双方都生气的女孩。

Asuka pouted and stared at the page. "This was a really bad idea." She said disconsolately.

明日香噘着嘴，盯着那页纸。“这真是个糟糕的主意。”她沮丧地说。

"Hey Asuka! There you are!"

"嘿，明日香！你在这儿啊！"

Asuka snapped the notebook shut and looked up at the speaker.

明日香啪地一声合上笔记本，抬头望向说话的人。

"Oh, hey Hikari." 哦，嘿，光。

"I've been looking all over for you!" The pig-tailed Class Rep said.

"我到处找你呢！" 扎着马尾辫的班长说道。

"Well, here I am in all of my glory!" Asuka replied sardonically.

"好吧，我在这里，尽显我的辉煌！" 明日香讽刺地回答道。

"Um… yeah." Hikari said before sitting down on the bench next to her.

"嗯… 是的。" 光说完后，便坐在了她旁边的长椅上。

They sat there for a moment quietly before Hikari turned and looked at her friend with a concerned look on her face.

他们静静地坐在那里片刻，随后光转过身，面带关切地望向她的朋友。

"Asuka, are you doing okay?"

"明日香，你还好吗？"

"Oh yeah, never better!"

哦耶，再好不过了！

The Class Representative's face showed her doubt. "Are you sure? You gave us all a big scare the other day, you know? Is there something you want to talk to me about?"

班代表的脸上露出怀疑的神色。“你确定吗？前几天你可把我们都吓了一跳，你知道吗？是不是有什么事想和我谈谈？”

"Ummm… " Asuka thought for a second about how her friend would react to being told about the last year of her life, but dismissed the thought as bordering on insane. Looking around her at the warm sunny surroundings bustling with life and noise she wasn't too sure if she believed it herself. "No, not really. Just working through some stuff right now is all. I'm fine."

"嗯……" 明日香思考了一会儿，想象着朋友听到她过去一年生活后的反应，但随即觉得这个想法近乎疯狂，便将其抛诸脑后。环顾四周，温暖的阳光下，生机勃勃、喧嚣不已的环境中，她自己也不太确定是否真的相信这一切。"不，其实没有。只是现在正在处理一些事情而已。我没事。"

"I'm glad to hear it Asuka." Her friend said with a warm smile. "Just remember that I'm here if you need me."

"听到这话我很高兴，明日香。" 她的朋友带着温暖的微笑说道，"记得，如果你需要我，我一直在这里。"

"I don't need your help, Hikari." Asuka said with more force than she meant. "I-I mean. I'm okay. Just let it go. I don't want to talk about it!" She rested her head sullenly on her chin and stared out at the milling students in front of her.

"我不需要你的帮助，光。" 明日香说这话时，语气比她本意要强硬。"我-我的意思是，我没事。别提了。我不想谈这个！" 她闷闷不乐地把头靠在手上，目光投向面前熙熙攘攘的学生们。

"Okay." Hikari answered with a smile. She was used to such outbursts from her best friend. To her mind a reaction like that was a comforting sign that the fiery German was returning to her normal state of mind. Watching the other girl carefully she gauged her best moment to broach the subject that was currently occupying her mind.

"好的。" 光带着微笑回答。她已经习惯了她最好的朋友这样的爆发。在她看来，这种反应是一个令人安心的迹象，表明那个热情的德国人正在恢复到她正常的心态。她仔细观察着另一个女孩，判断着提出目前占据她心头的那个话题的最佳时机。

"Um… Asuka?" She said tentatively.

"呃… 明日香？" 她试探性地问道。

"Yeah?" "是吗？"

"I-I was talking to Kodama the other day… You remember Kodama?"

我前几天和儿玉聊天来着……你还记得儿玉吗？

Asuka searched her memory for a moment, it was a name that she hadn't thought of for a very long time. "Umm… Oh yeah! Your floozy of an older sister!"

明日香在记忆中搜寻了片刻，这是一个她已经很久没有想起的名字。“嗯……哦对了！就是你那个放荡的姐姐！”

Hikari's mouth twisted for a second, as if she wanted to argue with Asuka's description of her much adored older sister. Then she seemed to decide that it wasn't worth it. "Yeah, I guess you could say that." She finally allowed.

光子的嘴角扭曲了一瞬，仿佛想要反驳明日香对她深爱的姐姐的描述。但随后她似乎觉得不值得争论，最终还是承认道：“嗯，我想你可以说得没错。”

"What about her?" 她怎么了？

"Wellll… She's got this friend… Aaaand he knows about you being a famous and beautiful Evangelion pilot…"

嗯……她有个朋友……而且他知道你是那位著名又美丽的福音战士驾驶员……

"Which is perfectly true." Asuka interrupted. "However the identities of the pilots are supposed to remain classified information!"

"这完全正确。" 明日香打断道，"然而，飞行员的身份本应是机密信息！"

"Anyway," Hikari continued, ignoring Asuka's interruption. "Kodama has kind of promised him that you would go out on a date with him."

“不管怎样，”光继续说道，无视了明日香的打断。“小田已经向他承诺过，你会和他出去约会的。”

"She what?" "她什么？"

"Kodama says that he's a really nice guy and she owes him a favour!" The pig-tailed girl continued hurriedly. "It would be just one date, tonight at the Old Hakone Fairground. Please say that you'll do it Asuka! Please?" She begged.

“小圆说他人真的很好，我还欠他一个人情呢！”扎着马尾的女孩急切地继续说道，“就只是一次约会，今晚在老箱根游乐场。求你答应吧，明日香！求你了？”她恳求道。

Asuka had already opened her mouth to shoot her friend's ridiculous plan down in flames when her eyes suddenly went wide and she was unable to hide her gasp of astonishment.

就在明日香张开嘴，准备将朋友的荒谬计划彻底否决时，她的眼睛突然瞪大，无法掩饰自己惊讶的吸气声。

"Tonight, at the Old Hakone Fairground? Are you sure?"

"今晚，在老箱根游乐园？你确定吗？"

"Huh?" Hikari replied with some confusion. "Is that too soon? Kodama kinda insisted that it be tonight, but I can tell her to make it another night if you like."

"啊？" 光有些困惑地回答，"是不是太快了？小圆坚持说今晚就要，但如果你觉得不合适，我可以告诉她改天。"

"No, no, that's not it! If it's tonight then Shinji must be going to the cemetery to meet with his father! Now I finally know what's going on around here! Thank you Hikari!"

不，不，不是这样的！如果今晚的话，那么真嗣一定是去墓地见他父亲了！现在我终于明白这里发生了什么！谢谢你，光！

"Ummm… sure Asuka, no problem! I thought that you'd be angry at me for trying to set you up like this! I've got to go and let Kodama know right away. She said that he'll meet you at the main gate around seven-thirty!"

嗯……当然可以，飞鸟，没问题！我还以为你会因为我想这样撮合你们而生气呢！我得赶紧去告诉小玉。她说他会在七点半左右在大门口和你见面！

"Wait a minute… what?"

The excited Class Rep was already getting up from her seat and moving away from a slightly bewildered Asuka. "Thanks a heap Asuka! I owe you one!"

兴奋的班长已经从座位上站起来，远离了略显困惑的明日香。"太感谢你了，明日香！我欠你一个人情！"

"But… but… Ah scheiße!" The German girl swore as she realised what had just happened. 'Oh well…' She thought. 'At least I know when I am now. I'll just ditch the guy after a couple of rides and get back home before nine.'

"但是…但是…啊，该死！" 德国女孩意识到刚刚发生的事情后咒骂道。'唉，算了…' 她心想，'至少我知道现在是什么时候了。我就在坐几趟车后甩掉那家伙，九点前赶回家。'

The chimes sounded to signal the end of the lunch break. Asuka gathered up her notebook and pen and walked back towards the school buildings with a lighter step than she had before.

午餐休息结束的钟声响起，明日香收拾好笔记本和笔，脚步比之前轻快地向学校建筑走去。

Now she knew where she was in the scheme of things. Now she could really start to get things rolling.

现在她明白了自己在事物格局中的位置。现在她可以真正开始推动事情发展了。

Nothing else existed at that moment.

那一刻，别无他物。

The rise and fall of the melody filled the small apartment with its rich mellow tones. He was lost in the movement of the bow across the strings and the positioning of the fingers of his left hand as they effortlessly moved up and down the strings as the sheet music in front of him required.

旋律的起伏在小公寓里回荡，充满了它那丰富醇厚的音色。他沉浸在弓在弦上滑动的动作中，以及左手手指随着面前乐谱的要求，在弦上自如地上下移动的姿态中。

The boy found peace in those moments. In the peaks and troughs of the music he played the cares and worries of the world no longer crowded his mind. The events of the meeting with his father at the gravesite were a world away from him in that moment. It was just him and the music joining as one.

男孩在那片刻找到了宁静。在他演奏的音乐的高潮与低谷中，世间的烦恼和忧虑不再充斥他的心灵。与父亲在墓地相遇的情景，那一刻仿佛与他相隔一个世界。唯有他和音乐融为一体。

Slowly the piece came to its conclusion and he sat there breathing deeply as the last note died away and the apartment was silent once more.

乐章缓缓走向尾声，他坐在那里深呼吸，随着最后一个音符消逝，公寓再次陷入寂静。

Silent that was until the sound of clapping came from behind him. Shinji started. He had been so lost in the music that he hadn't even heard the door opening. He turned around.

寂静一直持续到他身后传来掌声。真嗣一惊，他完全沉浸在音乐中，连门被打开的声音都没听见。他转过身去。

"Uh… Hi Asuka. H-How long were you there for?"

呃……嗨，明日香。你……你站在那儿多久了？

"Long enough to be mightily impressed, Third Child! You play well, and Bach no less! Good to see you playing the music of a great German composer too!"

"时间够长，足以让人印象深刻，第三子！你弹得真好，还是巴赫的作品！很高兴看到你演奏伟大的德国作曲家的音乐！"

"Th-Thanks Asuka. I-I'm not very good."

谢、谢谢你，明日香。我、我不太擅长。

"False modesty is very unbecoming Third! You're good, very good. If I say you're good you'd better just accept it!"

"假谦虚可不适合你，第三！你很棒，非常棒。说你优秀，你就大方接受吧！"

Shinji smiled shyly and started to pack his cello away. Asuka moved out of the shadow of the doorway and into the main room.

Shinji got a good look at his housemate and almost dropped his cello in shock.

真嗣仔细打量了他的室友，惊讶得差点把手中的大提琴掉落。

"Asuka, you're hurt!" “明日香，你受伤了！”

"What, this?" She replied gesturing to the scrape above her left eye and torn and dirty green dress. "No, not really. I've just got a couple of scratches. You should see the other guy!"

"什么，这个？" 她回答道，指了指左眼上方的擦伤和破旧脏污的绿色裙子。"不，其实没什么。只是几处擦伤而已。你应该看看对方的情况！"

"What happened?" Shinji asked in concern.

"发生了什么事？" 真嗣关切地问道。

"Oh, my date just got a bit gropey after he'd paid for me to go on three rides and bought me two hot dogs and some candy-floss." Asuka replied lightly. "He seemed to feel that I owed it to him to 'Put out' as he described it and called me a 'Stuck up little slut' after I slapped him for, how do I put it? Touching the goods without permission!"

哦，我的约会对象在为我支付了三次游乐设施的费用、买了两个热狗和一些棉花糖后，开始变得有些毛手毛脚。他似乎觉得我欠他什么，用他的话说就是“该有所表示”，在我因为未经允许触碰我而给了他一耳光后，他骂我是“自命清高的小贱人”。

"Oh my God Asuka!" Shinji exclaimed with wide eyes. "How did your dress get all torn?"

"天啊，明日香！" 真嗣睁大眼睛惊呼道，"你的裙子怎么破成这样了？"

"Well, then he got a little physical and dragged around the back of some of the trailers at the fairgrounds and tried to rip my dress off, well that was until I rendered him probably unable to ever have children that is." Asuka said proudly. "Finally those goons from Section 2 showed up and dragged him off. Hopefully to some deep dark hole somewhere. Filthy pervert! Next time I see that Kodama I'm gonna kick her fat ass from here to Itoshima!"

“然后他开始动手动脚，在展览场地的几个拖车后面拖着我，试图撕掉我的裙子，不过直到我让他可能再也生不了孩子为止。”明日香自豪地说。“最后，第二部门的那些打手出现了，把他拖走了。希望是扔进某个深不见底的黑暗角落。肮脏的变态！下次再见到那个儿玉，我非得从这里把她肥屁股踢到爱知县不可！”

"Are you sure that you're alright. I should call Misato! I can't believe he tried to molest you!" She was surprised to see real anger in his eyes. "If anything had happened to you I-I'd…"

"你确定你没事吗？我应该给美里打电话！真不敢相信他竟然试图对你进行性骚扰！" 她惊讶地发现他的眼中真的充满了愤怒。"如果当时你出了什么事，我……"

"Shinji!" Asuka interrupted. "I'm fine! Really! I've dealt with a lot worse than some handsy gorilla with his brain stuck in his pants before. No to mention that Misato's probably puking in some back alley herself right now and in no fit state to do anything. You know how much she drinks at weddings! I'm fine! I just want to have a shower, get out of these clothes and take it easy for the rest of the night!"

"真嗣！"明日香打断道，"我没事！真的！我以前对付过比这个满脑子只有下体的猿人更糟糕的情况。更别提美里现在可能也在某个后巷呕吐，根本没能力做任何事。你又不是不知道她在婚礼上喝了多少酒！我没事！我只想洗个澡，换掉这身衣服，然后今晚剩下的时间就放松一下！"

"O-Okay…" Shinji replied unconvinced. He was about to let her go when an idea struck him. "Do you want me to clean up that scrape for you?" He blurted out in one rapid sentence.

"好吧…" 真嗣半信半疑地回答。就在他准备让她走的时候，一个念头突然闪过他的脑海。"要我帮你清理那个擦伤吗？" 他一口气快速地说出了这句话。

Asuka cocked an eyebrow at his daring. Shinji quickly blushed and dropped his head.

明日香对他的大胆挑了挑眉，真嗣立刻脸红，低下头去。

"S-Sorry…" "对不起…"

The German girl smiled to herself at the boy's discomfort. Feeling the heat rise in her own face she replied.

德国女孩在男孩的不自在中暗自微笑。感受到自己脸颊上的热度，她回应道。

"Sure, that would be nice." Asuka said, pulling one of the kitchen chairs out to the side and sitting herself down on it expectantly.

"当然，那会很不错。" 明日香说着，将厨房的一把椅子拉到一旁，满怀期待地坐了下来。

Shinji stared at her open mouthed for a few seconds.

真嗣目瞪口呆地盯着她看了几秒钟。

"Whenever you're ready, Third Child!"

随时准备好了，第三适任者！

"Uh… yeah." He quickly went over to the cabinet where the first aid supplies were kept. Placing the tub on the table he took out some plastic vials of saline solution and some cotton wool buds and laid them out next to where she was sitting.

"呃… 对。" 他迅速走向存放急救用品的柜子。将盆放在桌上，他取出一些装有生理盐水的塑料小瓶和一些棉签，并把它们摆放在她坐的位置旁边。

Asuka closed her eyes and raised her head slightly so as to make it easier for him to reach the graze on her forehead. "Okay, I'm ready." She said.

明日香闭上眼睛，微微仰起头，以便他更容易触及她额头上的擦伤。"好了，我准备好了。"她说道。

She head him swallow loudly. "Uh-huh."

她听到他大声地咽了咽口水。“嗯哼。”

She smiled to herself as she head him fumble and drop one of the vials onto the kitchen floor. Muttering he picked it up and twisted the top off and used it to wet the cotton wool.

她暗自微笑，听到他在厨房里摸索时不慎将一个小瓶掉落在地。他嘟囔着捡起来，拧开瓶盖，用里面的液体浸湿了棉球。

Asuka jumped slightly in her seat as the wet cotton touched the side of her face. It was strangely soothing to feel its coolness against the irritated skin of her forehead. Shinji apologised as a trickle of saline ran down her cheek, but she ignored it. His fingers were cool and gentle as they rested against her skin to help him gently clean the dry blood and dirt from her face. She could feel herself becoming lost in the moment with his soothing touch on her skin and his rhythmic breathing as he lost himself in the concentration required for the task.

当湿润的棉球触碰到明日香的脸颊时，她微微一跳。额头上的皮肤因刺激而感到不适，但棉球的凉意却出奇地抚慰人心。真嗣因盐水顺着她的脸颊流下而道歉，但她并未在意。他的手指凉爽而温柔，轻触着她的皮肤，帮助他轻柔地清理掉她脸上的干血和污垢。在他的抚慰触碰和有节奏的呼吸声中，她感到自己渐渐沉浸在这一刻，而他则全神贯注于这项任务，忘却了自我。

The tenderness of it was intoxicating. It was, she suddenly realised, what she had missed and craved the most during her lonely year with him in the post Impact wasteland. Just the sheer simple action of human care and physical touch seemed to reach some basic primal part of her soul. She realised that she had almost forgotten what it felt like to be touched by another human being.

这份温柔令人陶醉。她突然意识到，这是她在与他孤独共度的灾后荒原一年中最为怀念和渴望的。仅仅是人类关怀和身体接触这一简单至极的行为，似乎触及了她灵魂中某种基本的原始部分。她意识到自己几乎忘记了被另一个人触摸的感觉。

That revelation brought her back to herself. Her eyes flew open to find herself staring straight into the deep blue eyes of Shinji, his brow still furrowed in concentration.

那番启示让她回过神来。她睁开眼睛，发现自己正直视着真嗣那深蓝色的眼眸，他的眉头依旧紧锁着专注。

"I-I think that it's clean now Shinji." She said quietly.

"我想现在干净了，真嗣。" 她轻声说道。

"Uh… yeah. I think it is.." He answered awkwardly as he straightened back up, his face still a faint shade of red. "Are you sure that you're okay?"

"呃……是的，我想是的。" 他尴尬地回答道，同时挺直了身子，脸上仍带着淡淡的红晕。"你确定你没事吗？"

"Of course I'm sure that I'm okay! I'm the one and only Asuka Langley Soryu, slayer of Angels! It'll take more than one pea-brained pervert to get to me!"

我当然确定自己没事！我就是独一无二的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，天使的克星！区区一个脑子跟豌豆一样大的变态，休想接近我！

"I'm glad to hear that. It's just that you're hands are shaking." Shinji replied with a smirk.

我很高兴听到这个消息。只是你的手在发抖。" 真嗣带着一丝坏笑回答道。

Asuka looked down at her hands, which were betraying her by shaking visibly. Quickly she clasped them together in her lap and narrowed her eyes at Shinji. "I'm fine."

明日香低头看着自己那明显颤抖的双手，它们正背叛着她。她迅速将双手紧握在膝上，眯起眼睛望向真嗣，“我没事。”

A few more moments passed in awkward silence. Finally Asuka spoke.

又过了片刻，尴尬的沉默持续着。最终，明日香开口了。

"I'd better take that shower now."

我还是现在去洗个澡吧。

"Okay." 好的。

"A coffee would be nice when I come back out, Shinji-kun!" She said in her sweetest voice.

"我出来的时候来杯咖啡就好了，真嗣君！" 她用最甜美的声音说道。

"Sure." 当然。

"None of that that instant crud either!"

“也不要那种即时的垃圾玩意儿！”

"Sure." 当然。

"And one more thing Shinji."

"还有一件事，真嗣。"

"Yes?" He answered wearily.

"什么事？" 他疲惫地回答。

"Thanks for the Florence Nightingale performance, I really appreciate it!"

感谢您带来的弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔表演，我非常欣赏！

"Uh.. sure, no problem Asuka!" Shinji said in surprise.

"呃..当然，没问题，明日香！" 真嗣惊讶地说。

xxxxxxxxx 源文本：xxxxxxxxx 翻译文本：

Asuka sat at the kitchen table and nursed her precious cup of coffee in her hands lovingly. It had been waiting for her as she had come out of her bedroom after her shower. She had left the steaming bathroom and dashed to her bedroom to change into a comfortable loose yellow t-shirt and shorts.

明日香坐在厨房的餐桌旁，双手珍爱地捧着那杯咖啡。在她洗完澡从卧室出来时，这杯咖啡一直在等着她。她刚从热气腾腾的浴室冲出来，便急忙跑进卧室换上了一件宽松舒适的黄色 T 恤和短裤。

The luxurious heat of the shower had cleansed her of the rest of the dirt and feeling of violation that her unpleasant episode with her date had left her with. Now sitting comfortably in the kitchen, caffeine beginning to work its magic on her tired mind, she felt more truly at home than she had since her return back to Tokyo-3.

淋浴的奢华热气洗净了她身上剩余的污垢和被侵犯的感觉，那是与约会对象不愉快经历留下的。此刻，她舒适地坐在厨房里，咖啡因开始在她疲惫的头脑中施展魔力，她感到比自回到东京-3 以来任何时候都更像是真正回到了家。

Shinji sat on the floor nearby, lost in the music on his S-DAT player. She knew that he hung onto that antiquated piece of junk because his father had given it to him nearly ten years earlier on one of his infrequent visits to the young boy. It had been a throwaway gesture of something that the older Ikari no longer wanted, but the young Shinji had clutched onto the battered player like a lifeline. To him it was some small proof that his father still, in some way, cared for him. Even after all of these years, even though he usually professed to despise his father, it was Shinji's most precious possession.

真嗣坐在附近的地板上，沉浸在他 S-DAT 播放器的音乐中。她知道他之所以紧握着那件过时的破烂，是因为大约十年前，在他父亲难得的探望中，父亲将它赠予了他。那本是老碇不再需要的一个随手之举，但年幼的真嗣却如抓住救命稻草般紧握着那破旧的播放器。对他而言，这是父亲在某种程度上仍关心他的微小证明。即便过了这么多年，尽管他常声称厌恶父亲，这仍是真嗣最珍贵的所有物。

Asuka's mouth twisted. 'Cruel bastard' She thought.

明日香的嘴角扭曲了。'残忍的混蛋'，她心想。

"Hey Shinji!" She said.

"嘿，真嗣！" 她说道。

Shinji pulled the ear buds out and turned off his S-DAT. "Hmm?"

真嗣摘下耳塞，关掉了他的 S-DAT 播放器。“嗯？”

"How did things go today?" Asuka asked him.

"今天事情进展如何？" 明日香问他。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Are you dense or something? At the cemetery with your dad, how did it go?"

你是迟钝还是怎么的？和你爸在墓地那事，后来怎么样了？

"Oh, okay I guess." He answered.

"哦，好吧，我想也是。" 他回答道。

"Okay? Care to expand on that?"

"明白了吗？愿意详细说明一下吗？"

The young Ikari's face took on a thoughtful expression. "It… It was good, I guess. I talked with Father… I think that I understand him better now. He talked to me about how he uses his memories of Mother to keep going… and stuff."

年轻的碇的脸庞浮现出沉思的表情。“嗯……我觉得挺好的。我和父亲谈了谈……我想我现在更理解他了。他跟我谈到了他是如何利用对母亲的记忆来坚持下去的……还有其他一些事情。”

"Wow." Asuka said with some sarcasm. ""Stuff" you say? How insightful that must have been!"

"哇。" 明日香带着几分讽刺地说道，"你说的'东西'？那一定很有见地吧！"

Shinji frowned in confusion at her tone. "What do you mean?"

真嗣对她说话的语气感到困惑，皱起了眉头。“你什么意思？”

"I mean that you're fooling yourself if you think that you ever really can understand another person Shinji! Your father will tell you those things because that's what he wants you to hear, but you can never really know what motivates him, what is really going on in his mind. You're a fool if you think that you can!"

我是说，如果你认为你真的能理解另一个人，那你就太自欺欺人了，真嗣！你父亲会告诉你那些话，因为那是他想让你听到的，但你永远无法真正了解是什么驱使他，他心里到底在想什么。如果你认为你能做到，那你就是个傻瓜！

"I… Uh… Sorry." 我…呃…对不起。

Asuka sighed in exasperation. "Please don't say you're sorry for expressing your opinion. I didn't mean to be harsh on you, Shinji. I just don't want you to waste your life hanging onto the hope of something that may never happen."

明日香无奈地叹了口气：“请不要为表达你的观点而道歉。我并不是有意对你苛刻，真嗣。我只是不希望你把生命浪费在期待可能永远不会发生的事情上。”

He just stared at her without speaking. Asuka struggled to think of what to say next. So far her plans of reaching the boy were failing miserably. She knew that she couldn't just out and tell him that his father merely saw him as a tool to help him get his wife back, but she needed to get through to him somehow. She had to free him from his forlorn hope that his father would ever acknowledge him.

他只是默默地盯着她。明日香努力思考接下来该说什么。到目前为止，她接近这个男孩的计划都失败得一塌糊涂。她知道不能直接告诉他，他的父亲只是把他当作赢回妻子的工具，但她必须设法让他明白。她得让他摆脱那种注定无望的期待，即他的父亲会承认他。

"I… I'm sorry Shinji." She said, causing the boy's eyes to widen slightly. "Friends?" She said holding out her hand.

"我…对不起，真嗣。" 她说道，让男孩的眼睛微微睁大。"朋友？" 她伸出手说。

"Friends." Shinji answered her, taking her hand in his and shaking it gingerly.

"朋友。" 真嗣回答她，握住她的手，轻轻地摇了摇。

"That's better." Asuka said sitting back down at the table and taking another sip at her mug. "Great coffee by the way!"

"这样好多了。" 明日香说着重新坐回桌边，又抿了一口杯子里的咖啡。"顺便说一句，咖啡真棒！"

"Thanks." Shinji answered with a smile. They lapsed back into a comfortable silence.

"谢谢。" 真嗣微笑着回答。他们又回到了舒适的沉默中。

"I wonder when Misato will get home?" Shinji said out of the blue.

"我想知道三笠什么时候能到家？" 碇真嗣突然说道。

"I dunno." Asuka replied. She had almost forgotten again about their guardian being out at that wedding for most of the evening. She did remember her coming home very much the worse for wear that night… 'This night' She corrected herself. Asuka knew that she couldn't bee too far away. The first time around Misato and Kaji had nearly caught her and Shinji… 'Oh my God!' Asuka thought. 'That's perfect! I had nearly forgotten all about it!'

"我不太清楚。" 明日香回答道。她几乎又忘了他们的监护人那晚大部分时间都在参加婚礼。她确实记得她那天晚上回家时状态很糟糕……"就是今晚"，她纠正自己。明日香知道她不可能离得太远。第一次，美里和加持差点抓到她和真嗣……"哦，天哪！" 明日香想，"太完美了！我差点把这事全忘了！"

"Well, I'm going to brush my teeth!" Asuka exclaimed suddenly as she pushed the chair back from the table. Shinji looked on a little perplexed as she disappeared into the bathroom. The sound of running water and the buzz of an electric toothbrush came faintly to where he sat.

"哎呀，我要去刷牙了！" 明日香突然喊道，从餐桌旁推开椅子。真嗣有些困惑地看着她消失在浴室里。从他坐的地方隐约传来流水声和电动牙刷的嗡嗡声。

After rinsing and wiping her face the redhead reappeared from the bathroom and sat back down in the kitchen facing him.

红发女子洗完脸并擦干后，从浴室重新出现，回到厨房坐下，面对着他。

"Hey Shinji!" She said, a slight blush colouring her cheeks.

"嘿，真嗣！" 她说道，脸颊微微泛起红晕。

"Um… Hey Asuka." He replied uncertainly.

“呃…嘿，明日香。”他有些不确定地回答道。

"You wanna kiss?" 你想接吻吗？

"Huh!" Shinji replied with a gulp.

"哈！" 真嗣回答时咽了口口水。

"You know, kissing!" She said puckering her lips up to demonstrate. "Have you ever done it before?"

"你知道的，接吻！" 她撅起嘴唇演示道，"你以前试过吗？"

"Uh-uh." The boy shook his head.

"嗯嗯。" 男孩摇了摇头。

"Well, come on then, let's do it!"

好，那就来吧，我们开始吧！

"How come?" Shinji said with some confusion.

"怎么会这样？" 真嗣有些困惑地说。

"How come?" She repeated incredulously. "What do you mean 'how come'?"

"怎么会这样？" 她难以置信地重复道，"你说的'怎么会这样'是什么意思？"

"I-It just seems k-kind of sudden." He stammered.

“我-我只是觉得有点突然。”他结巴地说。

She smiled at him. "You got anything better to do? Or are you scared?"

她朝他微笑道：“你有更好的事做吗？还是你害怕了？”

He stood up. "I'm not scared!" He said forcefully. "Pucker up!"

他站了起来，语气坚定地说：“我不怕！”接着又喊道：“撅起嘴来！”

"That's more like it! Here I come!" Asuka strode purposefully towards the boy.

这才像样！我来了！" 明日香大步流星地朝男孩走去。

'No hesitation this time Asuka' She said to herself. 'And no nearly asphyxiating him either!'

这次没有犹豫，明日香自言自语道。“也没有差点把他勒死！”

Now they were standing right in front of each other. Asuka stared into his deep blue eyes. "Put your arms around me." She breathed. "I won't bite you!"

此刻，他们正面对面站着。明日香凝视着他深邃的蓝眼睛，轻声说道：“抱住我吧，我不会咬你的！”

Gingerly she felt his arms encircle her and press against her back. She did the same to him. "Unless you ask me to!" She said with an evil smile.

她小心翼翼地感受到他的双臂环绕着她，紧贴在她的背上。她也同样回应了他。“除非你让我停下！”她带着邪恶的笑容说道。

Wisely Shinji said nothing.

慎二明智地选择了沉默。

She closed her eyes and leaned her head forward, she felt Shinji do the same. She could feel his breath tickling her face. 'No nose holding this time!' she thought, fighting the urge to grin at the memory. Awkwardly at first their lips met for a brief moment, just a little too hard. Then almost in synchronisation they both backed off a little and then pushed forwards more gently. It wasn't one long kiss so much as a series of small kisses that kind of ran together into one longer smooch.

她闭上眼睛，将头微微前倾，感觉到真嗣也做了同样的动作。她能感受到他的呼吸轻拂着她的脸庞。'这次不用捏鼻子了！'她想着，努力抑制住因回忆而想要露出的微笑。起初，他们的嘴唇笨拙地碰触了一下，稍显用力。随后，几乎同步地，两人都稍稍后退，然后更温柔地向前靠近。与其说是一次长吻，不如说是一连串小吻，它们渐渐融合成一个更长的亲吻。

Finally, and somewhat regretfully for both of them, they broke apart.

最终，带着些许遗憾，他们分开了。

Several awkward moments passed with both of them just staring at one another. Asuka resisted the urge to make a smart-aleck remark and stood there smiling slightly at the Third Child. Shinji, for his part, looked back at the redhead with a more guarded expression, as if he was expecting a trap to spring and wanted to be ready for it.

几个尴尬的瞬间过去了，两人只是互相凝视着。明日香忍住了说俏皮话的冲动，站在那里对第三适格者微微一笑。而真嗣则以一种更为警觉的表情回望着红发少女，仿佛他预料到会有陷阱弹出，想要做好准备应对。

"Well?" Asuka asked finally, unable to take the silence any longer.

"好了？" 明日香终于忍不住打破了沉默。

"What?" Shinji replied. "什么？" 真嗣回答道。

"What do you mean "What?"" Asuka replied with some annoyance filtering through her good mood.

"你说的'什么？'是什么意思？" 明日香回答时，好心情中夹杂着些许不耐烦。

Shinji just stood and stared at her guardedly.

真嗣只是站着，警觉地盯着她。

"A beautiful girl kisses you and you just stand there like a stunned mullet saying "What?" like I just asked you if you wanted ice-cream! How about "That was great Asuka" or "When our lips met my knees turned to LCL Asuka"! Or anything but"What?"!"Asuka said irritably. What did it take to get an unguarded reaction from this guy? She was desperate to get through to him somehow.

一个美丽的女孩亲吻了你，你却像个呆头鱼一样站在那里，傻乎乎地问“什么？”，好像我刚问你要不要吃冰淇淋似的！你就不能说“那感觉真棒，明日香”或者“当我们的嘴唇相触时，我的膝盖都软成了 LCL，明日香”！或者随便说点别的，别只说“什么？”！”明日香不耐烦地说道。到底要怎样才能让这家伙露出不设防的反应呢？她迫切地想要以某种方式触动他。

Shinji's face darkened. "Why do you always do this to me?" He said raising his voice, startling the girl out of her musing.

真嗣的脸色沉了下来。“为什么你总是这样对我？”他提高声音说道，把女孩从沉思中惊醒。

"Do what?" Asuka replied confused by the boy's sudden change in tone.

"做什么？" 明日香回答道，对男孩突然改变的语气感到困惑。

"Why this?" He yelled, gesturing to the space between them. "You're always doing this to me! First you're all nice and treat me like you might just think that I'm someone you might actually not hate, and then the next instant you turn around and treat me like crap again! I can't take much more of this!" Shinji was breathing heavily now, his eyes bright with anger.

"为什么这样？"他吼道，指向两人之间的空隙。"你总是这样对我！一开始你对我很好，好像真的不讨厌我似的，但下一秒你又翻脸不认人，再次把我当垃圾对待！我再也受不了了！" 真嗣此刻呼吸急促，眼中闪烁着怒火。

Asuka could feel her own shock turning to anger too. It had taken a lot for her to let down her guard like this to try and reach this boy and he was angry at her? He thought that she was toying with him? Most of all she was frustrated that what had seemed to her like a sure fire plan to reach Shinji seemed to be blowing up in her face.

明日香也能感觉到自己的震惊正转变为愤怒。她费了很大劲才放下戒备，试图接近这个男孩，而他却对她生气？他认为她在戏弄他吗？最让她沮丧的是，原本在她看来万无一失的接近真嗣的计划，似乎正在她面前土崩瓦解。

"Well sorry for trying to do something nice for you, Third Child!" Asuka snapped. "Do you think that this is easy for me? I mean I'm trying my best here to show you how I feel and you throw it back in my face? You have no idea what I've been through to get here!" She could feel the beginnings of tears prickling at her eyes. "What's it gonna take, Ikari? Do I have to rip my fucking clothes off and wrestle you to the god-damned floor to get your attention!"

"哦，对不起，我尝试为你做点好事，第三适格者！"明日香怒气冲冲地说，"你以为这对我来说容易吗？我是尽全力在这里表达我的感受，你却把它扔回我脸上？你根本不知道我为了来到这里经历了什么！"她感觉到泪水开始在眼眶里打转。"到底要怎样，碇？难道我非得撕破我的衣服，把你按在地上才能引起你的注意吗！"

He just stood there, staring at the floor in front of her, seemingly unable to answer her question. Asuka relented a little, she could tell that he was confused by her actions. He had been hurt by trusting others too many times before in his young life. She just needed to show him that she was genuine in her intentions. She reached out her hand and touched his arm gently.

他就那样站在那里，盯着她面前的地板，似乎无法回答她的问题。明日香稍微缓和了一些，她能看出他因她的举动而感到困惑。在他年轻的生命中，他曾因过于信任他人而多次受伤。她只需要向他证明，她的意图是真诚的。她伸出手，轻轻地触碰了他的手臂。

"Shinji…" She began. "真嗣……" 她开始说道。

Shinji stepped away from her, his face pale and eyes boring into her. "Leave me alone!" He yelled, pulling his arm forcefully from her grip. He stared at her like that for a moment before his face screwed up and he almost ran out of the kitchen and to his bedroom, slamming the sliding door shut with a bang.

真嗣从她身边退开，脸色苍白，目光紧紧盯着她。"别管我！"他大喊着，用力从她的抓握中抽回手臂。他那样盯着她看了一会儿，随后脸庞扭曲，几乎是一路跑出了厨房，冲进自己的卧室，砰的一声重重地关上了推拉门。

"Stop stealing my lines, Third!" Asuka yelled after him. There was no reply. She just stood there, slowly getting her breathing under control. 'That didn't go a well as I had hoped.' Was her first half-dazed thought. Then her legs gave way underneath her as she realised the enormity of what had just happened. She, Asuka Langley Soryu, warrior against the MP Evas, survivor of Third Impact and only person on the planet who actually knew of the shit-storm that was to come, had lost control of her emotions at perhaps the one time that had mattered the most. Hot tears rolled down her cheeks and she sobbed uncontrollably as she sat on the floor. "F-Fucking g-great work Soryu!" Asuka berated herself between sobs.

"别再抢我的台词了，第三！" 明日香冲着他喊道。没有回应。她只是站在那里，慢慢地调整着呼吸。'事情并没有我希望的那么顺利。' 这是她最初的半迷糊的想法。随后，当她意识到刚刚发生的事情的严重性时，她的双腿支撑不住，瘫坐在地上。她，明日香·兰格雷·索西尔，对抗 MP 使徒的战士，第三次冲击的幸存者，也是地球上唯一一个真正知道即将到来的风暴的人，在可能是最关键的时刻失去了对自己情绪的控制。滚烫的泪水顺着她的脸颊流下，她坐在地板上，无法控制地抽泣着。"真-真是太-太棒了，索西尔！" 明日香在抽泣中自责道。

After a couple of minutes she got control of herself again and pulled herself up from the floor. Stiffly she walked to the door of 'Shinji's Lovely Suite'. Asuka knocked at the door gently. "S-Shinji." She said softly. There was no answer. "Shinji, I'm sorry about what I said, okay?"

几分钟后，她重新控制住自己，从地上站了起来。她僵硬地走向“真嗣的可爱套房”的门，轻轻敲了敲门。“真嗣。”她柔声说道。没有回应。“真嗣，我为我说的话道歉，好吗？”

"Go away!" Was the response from the other side of the door.

"走开！" 是门那边传来的回应。

"But, Shinji… I really want to… "

但是，真嗣……我真的想……

"G-Go away!" His voice cracked with the force of his yell.

"滚开！" 他的声音因用力吼叫而变得沙哑。

"Scheiße…" Asuka swore as she leaned her head against Shinji's door in resignation. 'How the hell am I gonna fix this?'

"该死……" 明日香无奈地将头靠在真嗣的门上，咒骂着。'这他妈的怎么解决啊？'

Her train of thought was interrupted by the sound of the front door to the apartment opening and the sound of awkward stumbling from the entryway. Asuka wiped her eyes on her t-shirt and walked to meet Kaji and a heavily intoxicated Misato as they entered the living area.

她的思绪被公寓前门打开的声音和玄关处笨拙的踉跄声打断。明日香用 T 恤擦了擦眼睛，起身去迎接刚进入客厅的加持和醉醺醺的葛城。

"Hey Kiddo!" Kaji said with a smile. "Could you give me a little help here?" The unshaven man was at that time supporting Misato with one arm around her waist and her right arm slung over his shoulder. Quickly ducking around the Major's other side she helped Kaji walk the inebriated woman to her bedroom.

"嘿，小朋友！" 加持笑着说，"能帮我个小忙吗？" 那时，这位胡子拉碴的男子正用一只手臂环抱着葛城美里的腰，她的右臂搭在他的肩上。她迅速绕到少校的另一侧，帮助加持将这位醉酒的女士扶到她的卧室。

"Thenksh Kaji!" Misato slurred as they sat her down on the futon. "You-you're a good boy!" She giggled as if she had made some clever joke. "Y-You sshould get rid of that sshtupid pony-tail… nobody has p-pony-tails anymore! Right Ashuka?"

"谢谢卡吉！" 当他们让她坐在蒲团上时，葛城美里含糊地说道。"你-你是个好孩子！" 她咯咯地笑着，好像说了什么机智的笑话。"你-你应该摆脱那个愚蠢的马尾辫……现在没人留马尾辫了！对吧，明日香？"

"Sure, Misato." Asuka replied, trying to hide her red rimmed eyes from the two adults. "They're so last week!"

"当然，美里。"明日香回答道，试图向两位成年人隐藏她那红肿的眼眶。"那都是上周的事了！"

"You can insult his honour and defame his good name," Kaji said with a smile. "But to insult a man's pony-tail is a wound beyond all others!"

"你可以侮辱他的荣誉，诋毁他的好名声，" 卡吉笑着说，"但侮辱一个人的马尾辫，那可是比任何伤害都要深的创伤！"

"P-Poor baby!" Misato said.

"可怜的小宝贝！" 碇真嗣说道。

"I'll live." Kaji replied. He looked at Asuka closely and frowned. "You okay Kiddo?"

"我会活下去。" 卡吉回答道。他仔细地看着明日香，皱起了眉头。"你还好吗，小家伙？"

"Yeah, just super." Asuka replied. Kaji gave her a questioning look. "Just had a bad experience at the fair tonight is all, but I'll be okay!"

"是啊，就那样吧。" 明日香回答道。加持给了她一个询问的眼神。"只是今晚在集市上遇到了点不愉快的事，不过我会没事的！"

"Glad to hear it" He replied, though his expression remained concerned. "Well, I better get going, big day tomorrow!"

"很高兴听到这个消息。" 他回答道，尽管他的表情依然带着担忧。"好了，我得走了，明天可是个大日子！"

"Byeee Kaji-kun!" Misato sing-songed.

"再见啦，加持君！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷欢快地说道。

"Bye Misato, bye 'Ska!" The spy said. "You going to be okay with Misato from here?"

"再见，Misato，再见，'Ska！" 间谍说道，"从这里开始，你能和 Misato 一起没问题吗？"

"Yeah, I'll be fine." Asuka answered.

"嗯，我会没事的。" 明日香回答道。

"Yeah, s-she's a big girl now! Aren't you Ashuka?"

是啊，她现在是个大姑娘了！你说是吧，阿舒卡？

"Afraid so." The redhead replied with a weak smile.

"确实是这样。"红发女子带着一丝苦笑回答道。

"Alright!" Kaji said, walking to the bedroom door. "I'll see myself out! Catch you later!"

"See ya!" 再见！

"Byeeee Kajiiiii!" Misato yelled loudly.

"再见啦，卡吉 iii!" 葛城大声喊道。

Asuka looked at her guardian, who was now sprawled out on her futon, still in her black dress and stockings. She hauled her back up to her feet and helped her pull her stockings off one foot at a time as her guardian supported herself with one hand on the dresser.

明日香看着她的监护人，此刻正瘫倒在她的蒲团上，依旧穿着那身黑色连衣裙和长筒袜。她费力地将监护人扶起，帮她逐一脱下长筒袜，而监护人则一手撑在梳妆台上以保持平衡。

"You really are hopeless aren't you?" Asuka asked her as the Major flopped back down on the futon and giggled. "How old are you anyway?"

"你真是没救了，不是吗？" 明日香问她，这时少校又瘫倒在蒲团上，咯咯地笑了起来。"你到底多大了？"

"Ol-Old enough to know what I-I'm doing!" Misato replied drunkenly.

"哦——年纪够大了，知道自己在干什么！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷醉醺醺地回答道。

"I somehow doubt that." Asuka said.

"我总觉得不太可能。" 明日香说道。

"You're so mean!" The Major pouted.

"你太刻薄了！"少校撅着嘴说。

"That's what I'm afraid of." Asuka muttered.

“这正是我所担心的。”明日香低声说道。

"Y-You kidsh didn't get u-up to any naughty stuffs while I was gone did you?" Misato slurred as Asuka helped her out of her dress and into her nightdress.

"你、你们这些小家伙，我不在的时候没做什么淘气的事吧？" 美里口齿不清地说道，此时明日香正帮她从连衣裙换到睡衣。

"No." Asuka replied sadly. "I tried but Shinji wasn't up for it."

"不。" 明日香悲伤地回答，"我尝试了，但真嗣不愿意。"

"He's a good kid." Misato said groggily.

"他是个好孩子。" 葛城美里含糊地说道。

"Yeah…" Asuka said. "He is, but he's a lot harder to reach than I ever thought he would be."

"嗯……" 明日香说道，"他是这样，但比我预想的要难以接近得多。"

The only answer she received was a light snore from her guardian who had finally lost her battle with unconsciousness and was sound asleep on her futon next to her.

她得到的唯一回应，是她监护人轻微的鼾声——这位监护人终于在与无意识的斗争中败下阵来，在她旁边的蒲团上沉沉睡去。

"You're not much help either!" Asuka said softly.

"你也没帮上什么忙！" 明日香轻声说道。

The redhead quietly pulled the sheet over Misato and left the bedroom and padded back towards her own. She paused briefly in front of Shinji's bedroom door. Briefly she considered knocking on his door again. Her fist hovered in front of it momentarily as she debated with pros and cons of giving it another try with him that night. Eventually she decided that it would be better to sleep on it and try him anew in the morning. There was too much residue in the air front their earlier fight for her liking at that moment. Asuka stomped back to her own silent room. Moodily she undressed and got into her own sleeping attire of underpants and a long t-shirt.

红发女孩悄无声息地为美里盖好被子，离开了卧室，轻手轻脚地朝自己的房间走去。她在真嗣的卧室门前短暂停顿，犹豫着是否再次敲门。她的拳头在门前悬停片刻，权衡着当晚再次尝试与他沟通的利弊。最终，她决定还是先睡一觉，明早再找他谈。那时空气中还残留着他们之前争吵的余味，让她感到不适。明日香闷闷不乐地回到自己静悄悄的房间，脱下衣物，换上睡衣——一条内裤和一件长 T 恤。

"Great going today Asuka." She whispered to herself as she lay under the fresh clean sheets of her bed. "Hey Rei/Lilith thing!" She said to the darkened ceiling. "If I blow it this time around, any chance of a third try?"

"今天表现不错，飞鸟。" 她躺在干净的新床单下，轻声自语。"嘿，零/莉莉丝！" 她对着昏暗的天花板说道，"如果这次搞砸了，还有第三次机会吗？"

The night gave her no answer.

夜晚没有给她任何答案。

"That's what I thought."

我也是这么想的。

Finding sleep was once again an all too elusive quest for the Second Child that night.

那一夜，对于第二孩子来说，寻找睡眠再次成为一场难以捉摸的追寻。

End Chapter 6 第六章结束

A/N: Sorry to end this chapter on a bit of a downer, but if everything went well first time then this would end up a much shorter story than the one I have envisaged.

作者注：很抱歉这一章以略显低落的情绪结束，但如果一切首次尝试就顺利的话，那么这个故事将会比我设想中的要短得多。

I feel like I've established the parts of the story that I need to before moving onto more action based chapters, so things will pick up soon though!

我感觉我已经构建了故事中必要的部分，接下来将进入更多以动作为主的章节，所以情节很快就会加快！

Giant robots haven't featured in this story yet, which is kind of a problem for a fic based on a Giant Robot anime. I promise such issues shall be addressed and remedied in the next chapter.

巨型机器人尚未在这故事中登场，对于一部以巨型机器人动画为蓝本的小说来说，这确实是个问题。我保证，这些问题将在下一章得到解决和补救。

At least we all know when Asuka is in the Evangelion timeline. As for what happens next… Stay tuned!

至少我们都知道明日香在福音战士时间线中的位置。至于接下来会发生什么……敬请期待！

Thanks for reading. As always, any reviews are greatly appreciated!

感谢阅读。一如既往，任何评论都深表欢迎！

Cheers! 干杯！

Chapter 7: Still Life with Giant Robots

第 7 章：巨型机器人的静物画

Hi there! 你好！

Sorry for the huge delay in updating, this chapter was the victim of huge writers block, and several re-writes. So it took a veritable age to be finished. It was also going to be a much longer chapter, but I've decided to split it up into two parts, to stop it becoming too unwieldy.

抱歉更新延迟了这么久，这一章遭遇了严重的写作障碍，经历了多次重写。因此，完成它花费了相当长的时间。原本打算写得更长一些，但我决定将其分为两部分，以免过于冗长。

Unbroken 坚不可摧

Still Life with Giant Robots

巨型机器人静物画

Rei Ayanami was confused. This state of confusion was a new experience to the blue haired girl… and she didn't like it.

绫波丽感到困惑。这种困惑的状态对蓝发少女来说是全新的体验……她并不喜欢这种感觉。

Confusion would indicate uncertainty. Uncertainty would indicate doubt. The First Child had been conditioned never to doubt what she saw before her. Never to doubt what The Commander told her. Never to question what were clear and immutable truths.

困惑表明了不确定性。不确定性表明了怀疑。第一孩子已被训练成永远不会怀疑她眼前所见。永远不会怀疑指挥官告诉她的话。永远不会质疑那些清晰且不可改变的真理。

Now Rei Ayanami knew doubt. For the last week it had assailed her. Doubt gnawed at the back of her consciousness like a mouse on a power cable. Doubt crept through the myriad passageways of her psyche and whispered seditious words in her ear. Doubt sat smugly at the core of her being and played Jenga™ with the building blocks of her life.

现在，绫波丽知道了怀疑。过去一周它一直困扰着她。怀疑像老鼠啃咬电源线一样在她的意识背后啃噬。怀疑悄悄穿过她心灵的无数通道，在她耳边低语煽动性的话语。怀疑得意地坐在她存在的核心，玩弄着她生命的积木。

Rei Ayanami was beginning to get seriously annoyed with doubt and sought this day, in her own direct manner, to evict it from its new-found residence. The biggest problem she faced was this; her limited life experience hadn't really equipped her with the tools she need to solve her unfamiliar problem. That morning things had changed. As she had gone about her morning routine the solution had come to her seemingly from out of the blue.

绫波丽开始对疑虑感到极度厌烦，并决定以她特有的直率方式，在这一天将其从新占据的居所驱逐出去。她面临的最大问题是：有限的生活经验并未为她提供解决这个陌生问题的工具。然而，那天早上情况发生了变化。当她进行晨间例行活动时，解决方案似乎凭空出现在她脑海中。

Rei Ayanami now sought out the Second Child. Throughout that day at school she had been unable to gain the access that she had so desired to Asuka Soryu. During recess and the lunch hour Class Representative Horaki had been hovering closely by her target's side. Rei began to grow more anxious as the urge within her grew more strident.

绫波丽现在开始寻找第二适格者。那天在学校，她一直无法接近她渴望见到的惣流·明日香。在课间休息和午餐时间，班长堀崎总是紧随其目标身边。随着内心的冲动愈发强烈，绫波丽开始变得更加焦虑。

If she had been asked, she couldn't have explained why speaking with the pilot of Unit 02 was suddenly so important to relieving her of the burden of her doubt. It was as if a voice, her own, but at the same time not her own, was pushing her to interact with the redheaded pilot.

如果有人问她，她也解释不清为何与二号机的飞行员交谈突然变得如此重要，能缓解她的疑虑。仿佛有一个声音，既是她自己的，又不是她自己的，在推动她与那位红发飞行员交流。

Now the school day had ended and the three pilots had gone their separate ways before having to head to Central Dogma for the latest round of synchronisation testing. Rei walked briskly along the footpath. She almost always went straight from school to NERV on testing days. The other two Children usually spent the intervening hour or so with friends or doing homework. Rei had little need of either of those activities and would usually walk to NERV to prepare for the testing and then wait outside the Commander's office in case he should require to speak to her.

现在学校的一天结束了，三位飞行员在前往中央教条进行最新一轮同步测试之前已经各自离去。绫波丽快步走在人行道上。她几乎总是在测试日直接从学校前往 NERV。其他两个孩子通常会在这一小时左右的时间里与朋友相处或做作业。绫波丽对这两项活动都没有太大需求，通常会步行到 NERV 准备测试，然后在外面等待指挥官办公室，以防他需要与她交谈。

Today was different. Today, unlike every other day, she went straight past her usual entry point to the Geofront. Today the First Child walked with a purpose usually absent from her measured stride. Those very few that knew her well would immediately have spotted the difference in the girl. The educated observer would have seen that Rei Ayanami was clearly looking for something.

Or someone. 或者某人。

The day was warm, the humidity eased somewhat by the light breeze that played through the leaves of the plane trees that lined and shaded the footpath. Rei paid it no heed. At last knew that she was approaching her quarry as a flash of colour and movement caught her eye in the distance.

那天天气温暖，轻风穿过排列在人行道两旁悬铃木的叶子，略微缓解了湿度。零对此毫不在意。终于，她知道自己接近了猎物，因为远处一抹色彩和动静吸引了她的目光。

She saw the familiar silhouette and unmistakeable red hair of the girl who had been at the centre of her thoughts for the last few days.

她看到了那个熟悉的身影和女孩那无可置疑的红发，这个女孩最近几天一直占据着她的思绪中心。

The Second Child was walking alone less than one hundred metres in front of her. Rei hung back a little and observed the other girl as she walked. Asuka's gaze was cast down and she would kick at the occasional pebble that crossed her path. The blue haired girl was puzzled. The behaviour of Pilot Soryu had been aberrant for a couple of weeks now. Beginning with her unexplained outburst during Second Impact Studies and culminating in her unusual actions of the moment. The normally fiery redhead had definitely been much more subdued in recent weeks. Less liable to violence and sarcastic remarks than before and much more often preferring to keep to herself while at school.

二号机驾驶员独自一人在她前方不到一百米处走着。丽稍稍放慢脚步，观察着那位少女的行走。明日香的目光低垂，不时踢开挡路的石子。这位蓝发少女感到困惑。苍龙驾驶员的行为已经异常了好几周，从第二次冲击研究课上的莫名爆发，到此刻的异常举动。平日里火辣的红发少女最近明显变得更为内敛，不再像以前那样容易动怒和尖酸刻薄，更多时候宁愿在学校里独来独往。

The Second Child's involvement with Pilot Ikari had taken an even more dramatic turn. From Rei's observations it seemed as if Shinji was avoiding talking or interacting with Asuka while they were at school. At the same time she often noticed that Pilot Soryu could be found staring pensively at the young Ikari.

第二适格者与碇真嗣的关系出现了更为戏剧性的转变。从绫波丽的观察来看，似乎在学校时，真嗣在刻意回避与明日香交谈或互动。与此同时，她经常发现索琉驾驶员明日香会若有所思地凝视着年轻的碇真嗣。

The usual drills and combat training at NERV had kept them mostly separated over the last week but she could still detect a definite coolness in the interactions of the other two pilots. Something deep inside her goaded her to discover the reason behind this unwarranted change in her world.

在 NERV 进行的常规训练和战斗演练使得他们上周大部分时间都分开了，但她仍能察觉到另外两位驾驶员之间的互动明显冷淡。内心深处有什么驱使着她去探究这个无端改变她世界的原因。

Rei waited at a set of pedestrian lights as she mused on these strange developments. In the distance ahead of her the slight figure of the Second Child had become lost in the crowd of shoppers making their progress along the retail districts that lined the way.

零站在一组人行横道灯前，沉思着这些奇怪的发展。在她前方远处，第二适格者的瘦小身影已消失在沿着零售区行进的购物者人群中。

The signal changed to green and Rei crossed the street with an unfamiliar nervous tension twisting inside her stomach. The shopping crowd had dispersed itself amongst the busier side streets, but Asuka was nowhere to be seen. She quickened her pace and reached the spot where she had last spied the redhead.

信号转为绿色，绫带着一种陌生的紧张感穿过街道，胃里仿佛有东西在扭曲。购物的人群已经散布到更繁忙的侧街，但明日香却不见踪影。她加快脚步，来到最后一次看到红发女孩的地方。

There was no sign of the other girl. Rei pressed her lips together in annoyance. She walked further along the rows of small businesses and stopped again at an otherwise nondescript convenience store. She surveyed it curiously. On an impulse she walked through the door and into the dimly lit store. The clerk at the counter looked at her apathetically for a moment before returning to his manga. Apart from Rei it seemed that the shop was totally empty of patrons. Around her brightly coloured packages of instant meals and snack food lined the shelves. People she didn't know smiled out at her from the covers of the magazines in the rack next to the counter. There clearly was nothing to help her here.

另一个女孩毫无踪迹。零不悦地抿紧嘴唇，沿着一排排小商铺继续前行，再次停在一个看似普通的便利店前。她好奇地打量着，冲动之下推门而入，走进昏暗的店内。柜台后的店员漠然地看了她一眼，便又埋头于漫画之中。除了零，店里似乎再无其他顾客。四周货架上摆满了色彩鲜艳的即食餐和零食包装。她不认识的人们从柜台旁杂志架上的封面中向她微笑。显然，这里没有任何能帮到她的东西。

She was about to leave when the sound of a car's engine being revved loudly caused her to stop in her tracks. Through the doorway she saw a dark green sports car pull up at the kerb in front of the store.

她正要离开，突然一阵汽车引擎轰鸣声让她停下了脚步。透过门口，她看到一辆深绿色的跑车在商店前的路边停了下来。

Rei hung back in the shadow of the doorway as the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle stepped out of the car. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she recognised him almost instantly. Special Inspector Kaji was well known to the First Child. She didn't trust his easy confidence and glib charm. She knew that the Commander and Sub Commander didn't trust the man entirely, though they seemed to tolerate him and even draw him into some of their confidences.

当司机兼唯一的乘客从车中走出时，绫波丽在门廊的阴影中静候。她一眼便认出了他，眼神微眯。特别调查员加持先生对第一适格者来说并不陌生。她不信任他那轻松的自信和油滑的魅力。她知道，司令和副司令虽然似乎容忍他，甚至偶尔向他透露一些机密，但并未完全信任这个人。

The pony-tailed agent did a quick head check around him. Rei instinctively stepped back a pace into the recesses of the store, but he made no sign of having seen her.

扎着马尾的特工迅速环顾四周。零本能地向后退了一步，躲进商店的深处，但他似乎并没有注意到她。

"Are you going to buy something, or are you just gonna stand there?"

你是要去买东西，还是就站在那儿？

Rei turned around to look at the store clerk. The man sat behind the counter stared over the top of his manga at her. A scantily clad girl with unrealistically coloured hair and eyes posed provocatively on the cover. His greasy hair hung down over his eyes as he leered at her openly.

零转身看向店员，那男子坐在柜台后，从漫画上方盯着她。封面上，一个衣着暴露、发色与眼眸都极不真实的女孩摆出挑逗的姿势。他油腻的头发垂下遮住了眼睛，却毫不掩饰地向她投来猥琐的目光。

"I do not wish to purchase anything." Rei answered the man.

"我不想买任何东西。" 雷回答那个男人。

"Then get out. This isn't the Shibuse Hyper-mall." The clerk replied surlily.

“那就出去吧。这里可不是芝部世超级商城。”店员不悦地回答道。

Rei looked back out of the doorway and saw that Kaji had moved on. Without giving the clerk a second glance she stepped through and back out into the humid afternoon sunshine.

丽再次从门口望出去，发现卡吉已经离开了。她没有再看店员一眼，便踏出门外，重新回到潮湿的午后阳光下。

Blinking rapidly to adjust her eyes to the brighter light outside she looked left and right before catching sight of the back of a pony-tailed figure disappearing around the corner. Quickly Rei walked to the corner and peered around it into the street beyond. She instantly recognised Agent Kaji as he crossed the road about twenty metres away, making a bee-line to a small sidewalk café on the other side. Sitting with her back to Rei's position at one of the tables that sheltered beneath a large canvas umbrella, and apparently talking to a waitress, Rei once again recognised the figure of the Second Child. The waitress moved away and Asuka looked back and smiled and waved as she saw Kaji approach. Rei hung back and attempted to conceal herself behind one of the plane trees that lined the street-scape.

她快速眨眼以适应外面更亮的光线，左右张望后，瞥见一个马尾辫身影在拐角处消失。雷伊迅速走向拐角，探头望向街道的另一边。她立刻认出了正在横穿马路、直奔对面小路边咖啡馆的卡吉特工，距离约二十米。坐在一张大帆布伞下的桌子旁，背对着雷伊的位置，显然在与一位女服务员交谈，雷伊再次认出了第二适格者的身影。女服务员离开后，明日香回头看见卡吉走来，微笑着挥手。雷伊则退后一步，试图藏身于街道旁的一棵悬铃木后。

Such hiding and subterfuge were usually completely beyond the blue haired girl's experience, but now they felt like the natural thing to do. She felt that if she were detected by the pair that she would be upsetting Asuka and she wished to avoid the Second Child's ire at this point. Rei still hoped to converse with her to attempt to quiet her own sense of unease.

这种躲藏和诡计通常完全超出了蓝发女孩的经验范围，但现在它们感觉像是自然而然的事情。她觉得如果被那两人发现，会惹恼明日香，她此刻希望避免第二适格者的怒火。绫波丽仍然希望能与她交谈，试图平息自己的不安感。

Shortly the waitress returned with two cups of coffee and placed them in front of the two. The redhead took a large sip from her cup and from what Rei could tell she began to speak, seldom giving the pony-tailed man a chance to interrupt. Oddly, to Rei at least, she saw that the normally confident Second Child didn't once raise her eyes from her cup the whole time that she spoke, and her hands seemed unable to hold still, but fiddled with and spun the cup constantly on its saucer in front of her.

不久，服务员端来了两杯咖啡，放在两人面前。红发女子从杯中大口啜饮，据绫波所见，她开始说话，很少给那位马尾男子插话的机会。奇怪的是，至少在绫波看来，她发现平时自信的第二适格者在整个谈话过程中，眼睛一次也没有离开过自己的杯子，双手似乎也静不下来，不停地在面前的碟子上转动着杯子。

From her vantage point Rei was unable to see Asuka's face as she spoke to Kaji, but she was able to clearly discern the older man's reaction to the conversation. At first the man's confident façade remained intact as he smiled indulgently at his younger companion. Then quickly his smile faded and a look of puzzlement sat on his features. Finally his face appeared to show a genuine shock at whatever the girl sitting opposite him was saying.

从她的有利位置，绫波无法看到明日香与加持交谈时的面容，但她能清晰地察觉到这位年长男子对谈话的反应。起初，男子自信的外表依旧完好，他带着宠溺的微笑回应着年轻的同伴。然而很快，他的笑容消失了，取而代之的是一脸困惑。最终，他的表情似乎因为对面女孩所说的话而流露出真正的震惊。

Eventually it appeared that Asuka had finished speaking. Both of them sat silently for several minutes, the redhead apparently dabbing at her eyes and face with a napkin.

最终，似乎明日香已经说完了。两人静静地坐了几分钟，红发女孩显然正用纸巾轻拭着她的眼睛和脸庞。

Kaji stared at her with his hand over his chin for what felt like an age to Rei. Eventually he spoke at length to the young pilot, who seemed to answer him in much shorter sentences, still staring all the time at her cup. Then finally Kaji stood up, pulled his wallet out and drew several notes from it and placed them on the table in front of Asuka. Placing his hand on the girl's shoulder he spoke a couple of words before walking back across the street towards Rei's position. Rei slid herself further around its trunk so as to remained concealed, but the pony-tailed man strode by without even a sideways glance at where she stood. Within seconds he had vanished back around the corner.

加治凝视着她，手托着下巴，对丽来说仿佛过了一个世纪。最终，他向那位年轻飞行员长篇大论地说了些什么，而对方似乎以更简短的句子回应，目光始终未离她的杯子。最后，加治站起身，掏出钱包，抽出几张钞票放在明日香面前的桌上。他轻拍了下女孩的肩膀，说了几句，便穿过街道朝丽的方向走来。丽悄悄地绕着树干挪动，以保持隐蔽，但那位马尾男子大步走过，甚至没有向她所在的方向侧目。几秒钟后，他便消失在拐角处。

Looking back to the café she could see that the Second Child had departed as well. Once again Rei was unable to tell which direction Asuka had gone. Not wishing to give away the fact that she had been spying herself, Rei waited until she saw the green sports car pass the end of the street before making her own way back to her usual entrance to the Geofront. As she walked her inexperienced mind attempted to make some sense of what she had witnessed. She knew that in the past Pilot Soryu had made no secret of her infatuation with Agent Kaji, but this had seemed much different from a childish confession of love from an immature girl to an older man.

回头望向咖啡馆，她发现第二适格者也已经离开。雷再次无法判断明日香的去向。为了不暴露自己偷窥的事实，雷等到那辆绿色跑车驶过街尾后，才返回她通常进入第三新东京市地下的入口。行走间，她那未经世事的心智试图理解所目睹的一切。她知道，过去索琉香驾驶员对葛城调查官的迷恋从未掩饰，但这次似乎与一个不成熟少女向年长男性表白的幼稚情感大相径庭。

The spy's candid reaction to whatever Asuka had told him hinted at something beyond what Rei was able to grasp. Much to her annoyance, her confusion had increased dramatically when she had merely sought to diminish it.

间谍对明日香所说之事的坦率反应，暗示了绫波所无法理解的一些东西。令她懊恼的是，她本想减少困惑，结果却戏剧性地增加了。

Maybe if she asked the Commander he would be able to help explain what may have happened more satisfactorily.

或许，如果她向指挥官询问，他或许能更令人满意地解释可能发生了什么。

Almost instinctively she knew that this would be an unwise move. She had never kept a secret from Commander Ikari in her entire life, but something inside her told her that he would not appreciate her interest in the doings of the Second Child.

她几乎本能地意识到，这会是一个不明智的举动。她一生中从未对碇司令隐瞒过任何秘密，但内心深处有个声音告诉她，司令不会欣赏她对第二适格者行动的关注。

Resolving to keep her knowledge and doubts to herself until she could learn more, Rei swiped her access card through the reader at the main gate and descended into the labyrinthine passageways of the Geofront.

决心将自己的知识和疑虑保留到能了解更多之时，绫波丽在主门处的读卡器上刷了通行卡，随后深入到 Geofront 错综复杂的通道中。

The latest round of sync-testing was due to start in less that half and hour.

最新一轮同步测试预计将在不到半小时后开始。

"Come on Asuka, concentrate!" The Major encouraged her charge. She was deeply worried about Asuka. Sure the girl's behaviour had been… unusual… recently, but now Misato was beginning to really worry about her with this sudden new development. The telemetry data on Ritsuko's screen told what would be a devastating tale for the redheaded pilot.

"来吧，明日香，集中精神！" 少校鼓励着她的学员。她对明日香深感忧虑。确实，这个女孩最近的行为一直很……异常……但现在，随着这一突发新情况，碇真嗣开始真正为她担心起来。律子屏幕上的遥测数据显示，这对红发驾驶员来说将是一个毁灭性的故事。

Asuka's synchronisation rate was currently hovering barely above Rei's.

明日香的同步率目前仅略高于绫波。

"Come on Asuka.." Misato repeated to herself quietly. This wasn't supposed to even be possible. This was just a run of the mill synch-test. How had it all gone so awry?

"来吧，明日香……" 葛城美里轻声自语。这本不该有任何可能发生。这仅仅是一次常规的同步测试。怎么一切就变得如此糟糕了呢？

The simulation bodies was merely conduits to the Evangelions themselves, enabling the scientific team in Project E to control the interface and, if the worst happened, physically sever the connection between pilot and their Unit without the risk of the Eva going berserk. They had been quickly jury-rigged to prevent a repeat of the damage to personnel and equipment that had resulted from Unit 00's disastrous activation back before the Angel's had attacked Tokyo-3 . To the Pilots in the plugs, apart from lacking the visual normal feedback, there was little tangible difference between sitting in the simulation plug and being in the Evangelion itself.

模拟体仅仅是与福音战士本体相连的通道，使 E 计划科学团队能够控制接口，并在最坏情况发生时，安全切断驾驶员与其机体的物理连接，避免 Eva 失控。这些模拟体迅速拼凑而成，以防重蹈 Unit 00 激活灾难时对人员和设备造成的损害，那是在使徒袭击东京-3 之前。对于插入栓内的驾驶员而言，除了缺乏正常的视觉反馈外，坐在模拟插入栓与身处福音战士本体之间几乎没有实质性差异。

Asuka sat in her plug as she tried to clear her mind and reach out to the Evangelion like she had done so easily in the past. Though she had been nervous in the lead up to the test, deep down she had been buzzing with the excitement of what finally being able to bond with Unit 02 would actually mean.

明日香坐在插入栓中，试图清空思绪，像过去那样轻松地与福音战士建立联系。尽管在测试前她感到紧张，但内心深处，她因终于能够与二号机真正融合而兴奋不已。

Donning the plug suit had certainly felt… well… weird at first, but frighteningly familiar all the same. The last time she had worn it she had been a battered and filthy waif staggering through Tokyo-3 during the first days of her struggle to survive after the Third Impact. She slid the clean and shiny bright red suit out of its sealed plastic package and stared at it apprehensively.

穿上这套紧身战斗服的感觉起初确实很……嗯……奇怪，但同时又令人惊恐地熟悉。上一次她穿着它时，还是一个在第三次冲击后挣扎求生的东京-3 区里，满身伤痕和污垢的可怜少女。她从密封的塑料包装中取出干净闪亮的鲜红色战斗服，忐忑不安地凝视着它。

Shedding her school uniform she left it in an untidy heap on the locker room floor. Tentatively stepping into the bright red suit she felt the familiar whoosh of air as she pressed the switch and it tightened around her body.

她脱下校服，随意地堆在更衣室的地板上。小心翼翼地穿上那件鲜红色的套装，她按下开关，感受到熟悉的空气呼啸声，套装随即紧贴身体。

"Ikuhayo Asuka!" She had breathed to herself, clenching her right fist in front of her she exited the locker room and walked purposefully to the testing lab.

"我要去了，明日香！" 她自言自语道，紧握右拳在胸前，步出更衣室，坚定地走向测试实验室。

Fighting down a small rush of panic she settled into the test plug Asuka closed her eyes and forced herself to breath in the first sickly-sweet breaths of the uncharged LCL.

她努力压制住一阵小小的恐慌，坐进了测试插座。明日香闭上眼睛，强迫自己吸入未充能 LCL 那第一口令人作呕的甜腻气息。

"Initiating start-up sequence" Came the disembodied voice of Maya Ibuki

"启动序列开始" 传来绫波玛雅的无实体声音.

The kaleidoscope of colour swirled around her for several seconds before resolving back into the inside of the test plug, albeit somewhat clearer due to the now electrolysed LCL filling both it and her lungs.

色彩万花筒般在她周围旋转了几秒，随后重新凝聚成测试插头的内部，由于现在电解后的 LCL 充盈其中及她的肺部，显得比之前更为清晰。

Immediately she reached out with her consciousness as she had been trained to do since she was five. Beyond the thought noise generated between her and Unit 02 by the link she could now feel the massive psychic weight of her Evangelion hungrily rushing forward to envelop her. 'Hello, Mother.' She thought to the presence in the plug with her.

她立即按照自五岁起接受的训练，伸出自己的意识。透过她与二号机之间链接产生的思维噪音，她现在能感受到她的福音战士那庞大的心灵重量，正贪婪地向前涌来，将她包围。“你好，母亲。”她向与她同在插入栓内的存在这样想道。

Instantly the temperature seemed to drop in the LCL she was sitting in. She could immediately feel the confusion and blunt rage of the Evangelion focusing on her. The intensity took her breath away.

刹那间，她坐在其中的 LCL 温度似乎骤降。她立刻感受到了那台福音战士的困惑与钝重的愤怒，焦点正集中在她身上。这股强烈的感觉让她几乎窒息。

"Asuka, what's wrong? Your sync-rate is barely in double figures!"

明日香，怎么了？你的同步率勉强达到两位数！

Asuka ignored Misato's question as she struggled to link with the Eva and gain control of the swirling raw emotion that it threw at her. She swore at herself for her cockiness. She had just assumed that knowing the secret of the ghost in the machine that it would welcome her with a mother's loving embrace. She had thought that she would quickly be able to establish her position as the top pilot and therefore able to better influence the upcoming battles and be better placed to protect Shinji from the horrors that she knew were to come.

明日香对美里的问题置若罔闻，她正努力与 Eva 建立连接，试图掌控那股向她袭来的汹涌原始情感。她暗自咒骂自己的自大。她原以为，既然知晓了机器中幽灵的秘密，它便会以母亲般的慈爱拥抱迎接她。她曾认为，自己能迅速确立顶尖驾驶员的地位，从而更有力地影响即将到来的战斗，并更好地保护真嗣免受她预知即将到来的恐怖。

Instead the Evangelion's aura recoiled from her as if she were a stranger to it. She could feel its incoherent and primal anger buffeting her senses as she battled with its will.

相反，那台福音战士的气场在她面前退缩，仿佛她对它而言是个陌生人。在与它的意志搏斗中，她能感受到它那混乱而原始的愤怒冲击着她的感官。

"Disconnect the nerves links, there's too much feedback in the system! Terminate the test!" She could hear Dr Akagi shouting.

"切断神经连接，系统中反馈太多了！终止测试！" 她能听到赤木博士在大声呼喊。

"No!" Asuka screamed. "I can do this!"

"不！"明日香尖叫道，"我能做到！"

"Asuka!" Misato cried in concern.

"明日香！" 惣流喊道，声音中带着关切。

"Trust me Misato!" She panted. "Just give me a few seconds!"

"相信我，美里！" 她喘息着说，"就给我几秒钟时间！"

Asuka took a deep breath of the LCL and cleared her mind, ignoring the wailing feedback from the nerve connections and the searing pain that lanced through her body. She focused her will on that of Unit 02. The presence of the Evangelion backed away from her a little in confusion. She now recognised what the problem was. The last time that she had synchronised with Unit 02 in this timeline she had been a precocious and self obsessed young girl. The Evangelion had known her and accepted her presence from the time she was five years old. It had grown and bonded with her. It had loved her in some primaeval kind of way. Now suddenly an Asuka who had experienced the end of the World, her own death and dismemberment and fought for survival for a year in the wilderness was sitting in the entry plug and expecting it to welcome her as its prodigal daughter. There was only one problem with this.

明日香深吸一口 LCL，清空思绪，无视神经连接传来的刺耳反馈和贯穿身体的灼痛。她将意志集中于二号机。那股使徒的存在因困惑而稍稍退却。她此刻明白了问题所在。上次在这个时间线与二号机同步时，她还是个早熟且自我中心的少女。从五岁起，使徒便认识她，接纳她的存在。它与她一同成长，建立了深厚的联系，以某种原始的方式爱着她。如今，一个经历了世界末日、自身死亡与肢解，并在荒野中为生存奋战了一年的明日香，坐在插入栓内，期待它像迎接浪子回头般欢迎她。唯有一个问题。

The Evangelion didn't recognise her as the girl who had last synched with it just over a fortnight ago in its own time frame. Its basic and primitive mother instinct could feel that Asuka was able to link to it, but the blunt and unfiltered emotion that the beast within was capable of reacted in violent confusion at her now unfamiliar psyche.

新世纪福音战士并未认出她就是两周多前在其时间框架内最后一次同步的女孩。其基本而原始的母性本能能感觉到明日香能够与之连接，但野兽本能所能表达的未经修饰的情感，在她如今陌生的心灵面前，反应出了剧烈的困惑。

Asuka gripped the control yokes tightly and concentrated all of her will back at the soul within the creature at the other end of the link. Latching onto the small part of the beast that she knew still recognised her she bent her thoughts towards it to the exclusion of all else. She was aware of Misato shouting instructions, but she ignored them. All she was concentrated on that tiny but significant link to the Evangelion.

明日香紧紧握住控制杆，将全部意志集中于链接另一端那生物体内的灵魂。她抓住了那头野兽中仍认得她的一小部分，将自己的思绪完全倾注于它，摒弃了其他一切。她知道美里正在大声下达指令，但她置若罔闻。她全神贯注于与那台福音战士之间微小却至关重要的联系。

Slowly, but inexorably, the psychic raging that buffeted her grew steadily quieter. Still she stayed focused on that link, shaping it with her mind until it responded to her will. Then, like someone inching along a precipice to safety, she drew herself towards it, gradually the beast at the other end of the link grew still and acquiescent to her will. Drawing in a deep breath of oxygenated LCL she opened her eyes to see the worried face of Misato Katsuragi staring wide eyed at her on the open com screen.

渐渐地，但不可阻挡地，冲击着她的心灵狂潮逐渐平息。她依旧专注于那条联系，用意念塑造它，直至它顺从她的意志。随后，如同小心翼翼沿着悬崖边缘走向安全之地的人，她将自己缓缓引向那联系，渐渐地，链接另一端的野兽也静止下来，顺从了她的意志。深深吸入富含氧气的 LCL 后，她睁开眼睛，看到的是通讯屏幕上，美里·葛城那双充满担忧的眼睛正紧张地注视着她。

"Synch-Rate stabilised at fifty-eight percent." Maya Ibuki's voice echoed hollowly over the intercom.

"同步率稳定在百分之五十八。" 碇真嗣的声音通过内部通讯空洞地回响着。

"Well done Asuka!" Misato breathed.

"干得好，明日香！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷轻声说道。

Asuka just closed her eyes and nodded.

明日香只是闭上眼睛，点了点头。

"What the hell just happened?" She heard her guardian ask the scientist to her left just before the Major closed off the com-link.

"刚才到底发生了什么？" 她听到她的监护人向左边的科学家询问，就在少校关闭通讯链接之前。

Ritsuko Akagi turned to her old friend. "It would appear that instability on the part of the pilot caused feedback in the synchronisation matrix." She said.

赤木律子转向她的老朋友说道：“看来是驾驶员的不稳定导致了同步矩阵中的反馈。”

"You're saying that Asuka caused this?"

你是说这是明日香造成的？

"No other explanation is possible." Ritsuko replied smugly. "All of the telemetry from Unit 02 indicated that the cause of the instability originated from the simulation-plug."

"没有其他解释是可能的。" 律子得意地回答道，"来自二号机的所有遥测数据都表明，不稳定性的根源来自模拟插入栓。"

"But it is stabilised now, right?" Misato asked anxiously.

"但现在稳定下来了，对吧？" 惴惴不安地，美里问道。

Ritsuko spent several long seconds poring over the data on the computer screen in front of her.

律子花了好几秒钟仔细研究面前电脑屏幕上的数据。

"According to the Magi the Second Child's psycho-graph is currently within a stable threshold with that of Unit 02. They predict a 99.8 percent probability that Asuka's current ratio will not undergo any further such anomalies in the future."

根据 Magi 的分析，第二适格者的精神图谱目前与二号机处于稳定阈值内。他们预测，明日香当前的比例未来发生此类异常的概率仅为 0.2%。

"A simple 'Yes' would have sufficed." Misato muttered.

"一个简单的'是'就足够了。" 碇真嗣低声说道。

Dr Akagi chewed the end of her biro pensively for a moment before re-opening the communication link to Asuka's sim-plug. "Come on Second Child! Fifty-eight percent! You must be able to do better than that!"

阿基医生咬着圆珠笔的一端，沉思了片刻，然后重新打开了与明日香模拟插头的通信链接。“来吧，第二适格者！58%！你肯定能做得更好！”

"I'm trying Doktor Schweinfrau!" Asuka replied testily.

"我正在尝试，施韦因富特博士！" 明日香不耐烦地回答道。

"Jeez Ritsuko!" Misato said, having returned to her seat at the back of the control centre. "Stop riding her so hard, you know Asuka's had a tough couple of weeks!"

"哎呀，律子！" 美里回到控制中心后排的座位上说道，"别对她那么苛刻了，你知道明日香最近几周过得很艰难！"

"That's no excuse Misato, and you know it!" The blonde scientist answered without even looking back at the major from her seat at the front of the room. "We need to have all of our pilots performing at maximum efficiency no matter what the circumstances! The Angels don't care if Asuka is having an off week or has just been acting like a spoiled little brat and, frankly, neither do I."

"这可不是借口，美里，你心里清楚！"金发科学家坐在房间前端，头也不回地回应着少校。"无论何种情况，我们都必须确保所有驾驶员发挥出最高效率！使徒可不会在意明日香是否这周状态不佳，或者她是否表现得像个被宠坏的小孩，坦白说，我也不会在意。"

"Man… who rattled your cage?" Misato muttered to herself. Ritsuko's previous animosity towards the Second Child really had been taken to a new level recently and for the life of her Misato couldn't figure out why. "At least she's stabilised… What about the others?"

“天啊……谁惹你了？” 美里自言自语道。律子之前对第二适格者的敌意最近真的升级到了一个新的高度，而美里就是想不明白为什么。“至少她现在稳定了……其他人怎么样了？”

"Hmm… " Ritsuko replied, checking the other readouts on her monitor. "Rei is stable at 54 percent.. and Shinji, well, see for yourself!"

"嗯……" 律子回答道，同时检查着监视器上的其他读数，"绫波稳定在 54%……至于真嗣，你自己看吧！"

Misato leaned forward so the she could read the screen in front of the blonde scientist. "Wow! 72 percent! That's his best score yet! At least there's some good news to come out of this test!"

碇真嗣身体前倾，以便能看清金发科学家面前的屏幕。"哇！72%！这是他迄今为止最好的成绩！至少这次测试带来了一些好消息！"

Ritsuko smiled bitterly before opening the channel to all of the pilots. "Good work Rei, you're up two points from last time."

律子苦笑着打开了与所有驾驶员的通讯频道，“做得好，丽，你这次比上次多了两分。”

"Yes." Replied the blue haired pilot, her face unreadable on the screen in front of her.

"是的。"蓝发飞行员回答道，她的表情在面前的屏幕上难以捉摸。

"And very good work from you Shinji!" Ritsuko continued. "You're at 72 percent! That's the highest score we've ever had from any of the pilots."

"真棒，真嗣，你的表现非常出色！" 律子继续说道，"你达到了 72%！这是我们所有飞行员中最高的分数。"

Shinji's usually guarded expression changed to one of shock and then a quiet smile finally showed on his features.

真嗣通常戒备的表情转变为震惊，随后他的面容上终于浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑。

"Th-Thank you…" "谢-谢谢你…"

Misato could see that Ritsuko was really enjoying herself as the blonde doctor continued. "That's fine Shinji, you deserve it! With your score up so high and Asuka's score down near Rei's, you're now our Number One Pilot!"

美里看得出来，随着金发博士继续说下去，律子真的很享受这一刻。"很好，真嗣，这是你应得的！你的分数这么高，而明日香的分数接近零号机驾驶员的，你现在是我们的一号飞行员了！"

The Third Child continued smiling for a few more moments before his expression changed again and he looked down at the image of Asuka on the screen in front of him. Asuka, however, seemed unable to meet his eyes and just kept her head lowered before shutting off the feed to her own plug. Shinji's features betrayed some shock as the window disappeared before looking back out at Ritsuko and Misato.

第三子继续微笑了片刻，随后表情再次变化，低头看向面前屏幕上的明日香影像。然而，明日香似乎无法直视他的眼睛，只是低着头，随后关闭了自己插入栓的通讯。当窗口消失时，真嗣的脸上流露出一些震惊，然后他转头看向了律子和美里。

"D-Did I really do well?" He asked, still unsure of how to handle his swirling emotions at this time.

"我真的做得好吗？"他问道，此刻仍不知如何应对内心翻涌的情绪。

"You sure did Shinji!" Ritsuko replied. "Like I said; 'You're Number One!'"

"你确实做到了，真嗣！" 律子回答道，"就像我说的，'你是第一！'"

"Misato?" Shinji asked, still unsure.

"美里小姐？" 真嗣问道，仍然不确定。

"Not the words that I would have chosen…" The Major muttered to herself, before shaking her head and seeming to come back to herself. "Well done Shinji… " Misato answered him finally. "That's you're best score ever!" She gave him the thumbs-up as encouragement.

"这不是我会选择的词……"少校喃喃自语，随后摇了摇头，仿佛回过神来。"干得好，真嗣……" 最终，美里回应了他。"这是你迄今为止最好的成绩！" 她竖起大拇指以示鼓励。

"Thank you." He said, finally allowing himself to look pleased.

"谢谢你。" 他说道，终于让自己露出了满意的表情。

"We're done here." Dr Akagi said, shutting off the video. "Maya, eject the simulation plugs and send all of the data through to Commander Ikari once you're done processing it."

"我们这里结束了。"赤木博士说着，关闭了视频。"真希波，处理完数据后，拔掉模拟插头，并将所有数据发送给碇司令。"

"Yes Ma'am." 是的，女士。

Misato picked up he coffee cup. "Send that data through to me as well please Lieutenant." She said more brusquely than she intended to Maya. She didn't notice the young tech's confused expression at the tension between the Major and her Senpai.

葛城美里拿起咖啡杯，语气比预期中更生硬地对真由美说：“请把那些数据也传给我，中尉。”她并未察觉到年轻技术员因少校与她前辈之间的紧张气氛而露出的困惑表情。

"Yes Ma'am." 是的，女士。

Misato exited the room, her mind troubled by the events that had just occurred. She was genuinely happy for Shinji at having achieved such a great score. Lord only knew that the boy needed every boost to his self esteem that he could get. She couldn't help being deeply concerned for Asuka though. The usually brash on self confident German girl had really been out of sorts lately, and this synch test would surely be nothing less than a disaster in Asuka's mind.

美里离开了房间，心中因刚刚发生的事件而感到困扰。她真心为真嗣取得如此优异的成绩感到高兴。天知道这个男孩多么需要提升他的自尊心。然而，她不禁对明日香深感忧虑。那个平日里自负且自信的德国女孩最近确实状态不佳，这次同步测试在明日香心中无疑将是一场灾难。

Misato had a bad feeling that the worst was yet to come.

碇真嗣有一种不祥的预感，最糟糕的情况尚未到来。

Rei walked out of the showers just in time to observe the Second Child venting her fury on her closed locker door with her right foot and fist. The light steel buckled under the barrage of kicks and blows that rained down upon it.

丽刚从淋浴间走出来，正好目睹第二适格者正用她的右脚和拳头对着紧闭的储物柜门发泄怒火。轻钢材质的柜门在连续的踢打和撞击下弯曲变形。

"Arrrgh!" The aggravated German screamed. "I wish this was that fucking Akagi bitch's pointy head!" More kicks and fist strikes pounded the locker until finally Asuka ceased her attack and turned on Rei who was still standing watching her.

"啊！" 愤怒的德国少女尖叫着，"真希望这是那个该死的赤城贱人的尖尖头！" 她又是一阵猛踢和拳打，直到最终停下攻击，转而怒视着仍站在一旁观看的绫波。

"What do you want?" Asuka snapped.

"你想干什么？" 明日香厉声问道。

"I fail to see the efficiency in destroying NERV property because you are disappointed at losing your premier piloting position to Pilot Ikari."

我无法理解，仅仅因为你在首席驾驶位置上输给了碇真嗣飞行员，就要破坏 NERV 财产的效率何在。

Asuka frowned darkly at her, the redhead's breaths echoing harshly in the confined locker room. "The last thing that I need right now, Wondergirl, is a lecture on 'efficiency' from you!"

明日香阴沉地皱着眉头看着她，红发少女的呼吸在狭小的更衣室里回响得格外刺耳。“我现在最不需要的，就是奇迹女孩你来给我讲什么‘效率’的课！”

Rei stared at her few a few seconds before she turned her back to her and began to dress in her school uniform.

丽盯着她看了几秒钟，然后转过身去，开始穿上她的校服。

Asuka nursed her bruised hand as she stared daggers at the other girl's back. "For your information, Ayanami, I'm angry because I that snooty bitch Akagi was lording it over me just because Shinji beat my score! She'd like nothing more than to see me fail, even at the expense of defeating the Angels!"

明日香一边护理着受伤的手，一边用锐利的目光盯着另一个女孩的背影。“告诉你，绫波，我生气是因为那个自大的贱人赤木，就因为真嗣超越了我的分数，她就趾高气扬地对我颐指气使！她巴不得看我失败，哪怕这意味着输给使徒！”

"You are still capable of operating your Evangelion." Rei replied without turning around. "I fail to see the justification for your current outburst."

“你仍然能够操控你的福音战士。”绫波没有回头地回答道，“我看不出你此刻爆发的理由。”

"You wouldn't!" Asuka spat. "It's not just that Shinji beat me. It's that I failed to beat him. Don't you know how much I needed to… I couldn't… Arrgh! Why should I even try to explain this to you?"

"你不会的！"明日香啐了一口。"不仅仅是因为真嗣打败了我。而是我没能打败他。你难道不知道我多么需要……我做不到……啊！我为什么要费劲跟你解释这些？"

Rei fastened the neck-tie of her uniform and turned around to meet the glare of the Second Child with an even and unblinking stare.

绫整理好制服的领带，转身迎上第二适格者的锐利目光，以一种平静且不眨眼的凝视回应。

"What?" Asuka said impatiently.

"什么？" 明日香不耐烦地说。

"I am experiencing doubt."

我正经历着怀疑。

"Congratulations, you're having what we humans call an emotion. I'm very happy for you!" Asuka said sarcastically. "Unfortunately I don't have the time now to throw a party for your 'real girl' awakening! I've got my own pile of shit to deal with!"

"恭喜，你正在经历我们人类所谓的情感。我真为你高兴！" 明日香讽刺地说道，"可惜我现在没空为你的'真正女孩'觉醒开派对！我自己的一堆破事还忙不过来呢！"

"You are referring to your failure in the synch-test?"

你指的是你在同步测试中的失败吗？

Asuka clenched her fists and suppressed a snarl. "Failure?" She said through clenched teeth. "I still beat your score, Wondergirl!"

明日香紧握双拳，强压下怒吼。“失败？”她咬牙切齿地说，“我依然超过了你的分数，奇迹女孩！”

"This is true. Yet you were lower than Pilot Ikari's score. Is this the source of your anger?"

这是事实。然而，你的分数低于碇源堂的。这就是你愤怒的根源吗？

"Why, all of a sudden, do you even give a fuck?" Asuka snapped, growing impatient with the blue haired girl.

"怎么突然之间，你还他妈在乎起来了？" 明日香不耐烦地对蓝发女孩吼道。

"I have been troubled by the instability of the recent circumstances surrounding yourself and Pilot Ikari. I have recently developed the strong feeling that you could assist in making this more clear to me."

我最近深感困扰，因为您和碇真嗣周围的情况不稳定。我强烈感觉到，您或许能帮助我更清楚地理解这一切。

Asuka's eyes widened. Did Rei suspect anything? No, how could she? All Asuka had managed to do so far was bumble around her old life screwing things up even more than they were the first time around.

明日香的眼睛睁大了。难道绫波怀疑了什么吗？不，怎么可能呢？到目前为止，明日香所做的不过是在她过去的生活中四处碰壁，把事情搞得比第一次还要糟糕。

"I-I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about!" She stuttered.

"我、我一点儿也不知道你在说什么！" 她结结巴巴地说。

"Nevertheless, Pilot Soryu, I have conceived a desire to converse with you, if I may?"

尽管如此，Soryu 飞行员，我萌生了与您交谈的愿望，如果可以的话？

Asuka smiled nervously. "You? Want to 'converse' with me?" Asuka said incredulously. "Sure, why not? My day can't get any worse after all. Go ahead Wondergirl, talk!"

明日香紧张地笑了笑。“你？想和我'交谈'？”明日香难以置信地说。“当然，为什么不呢？反正我的日子也不会更糟了。来吧，神奇女孩，说吧！”

The blue haired pilot of Unit 00 hesitated, seemingly uncertain of how to proceed.

零号机的蓝发驾驶员犹豫了，似乎不确定该如何继续。

"Come on then? Spit it out Wondergirl!"

那就快说吧，神奇女孩！

"You have changed." Rei said bluntly.

"你变了。" 零直截了当地说。

Asuka was entirely taken aback. "What do you mean, Changed?"

明日香完全惊呆了。“你说的‘变了’是什么意思？”

"You appear different to me. Your essence has altered."

你在我眼中似乎变了，你的本质已经改变。

"Essence!" Asuka screeched. "I have no idea what the hell you are on about, First!"

"本质！" 明日香尖叫道，"我完全搞不懂你在说什么，第一！"

"You have changed, I have seen the inconsistency in you since your outburst in the classroom. I have also observed the difference in the relationship between yourself and Pilot Ikari. You are not the same."

你变了，自从你在教室里爆发后，我就看到了你的不一致。我也注意到了你和碇源堂之间关系的不同。你已不再是原来的你。

"I'm don't know what they've been slipping into your LCL Wondergirl, but I'm still the same top pilot you'll never be!" Asuka said quickly trying to cover her nervousness at the other girl's apparent insight. Was she really that naked and transparent that even social hermit and poster child for introverts and shut ins everywhere could see straight through her?

"我不知道他们往你的 LCL 里加了什么，奇迹少女，但我依旧是那个你永远无法企及的顶尖飞行员！" 明日香急忙说道，试图掩饰自己在对方明显洞察力面前的紧张。难道她真的如此赤裸裸、透明到连社交隐士和各地宅男宅女的代言人都能一眼看穿她吗？

"Nonetheless," Rei answered with a sense of unassailable finality in her tone. "I sense a profound change has taken place in you, Pilot Soryu. Throughout this day I have been experiencing a strong desire to discuss this with you."

"尽管如此，"丽回答道，她的语气中带着一种不容置疑的决断。"我感觉到你身上发生了深刻的变化，索龙飞行员。今天一整天，我都有一种强烈的愿望想和你讨论这件事。"

"Well I sense a wind-up doll who is pissed off that even at my lowest she knows that she still can't beat me behind the controls of an Eva!" Asuka snarled back at her. "What does your new-found insight say to that?"

Rei seemed unable to answer Asuka's challenge. She stared unblinkingly at the German for thirty long seconds.

绫似乎无法回应明日香的挑战。她目不转睛地盯着德国人，长达三十秒之久。

"Well?" Asuka snapped. "What do you have to say now, Wondergirl?"

"怎么了？"明日香厉声道，"你现在还有什么要说的，奇迹少女？"

"I am not a doll." Rei finally answered quietly.

"我不是玩偶。" 绫终于轻声回答道。

Asuka snorted "Is that the best you've got?" Asuka snorted "Don't you have somewhere else to be Wondergirl?" She said testily. "I'm sure that your sparkling interpersonal skills are required elsewhere!"

明日香哼了一声：“你就这点本事？”她不耐烦地说：“你难道没有别的地方要去吗，奇迹女孩？我敢肯定，你那闪闪发光的人际交往能力在别处大有用武之地！”

The First Child stared at her for a little longer before seeming to realise the meaning of what Asuka had said. She blinked twice and then picked her satchel up from the inside of her locker and slung it over her shoulder.

第一少女又凝视了她一会儿，仿佛才领悟到明日香话中的含义。她眨了两下眼睛，随后从柜子里取出书包，搭在肩上。

"I'm leaving." She said as she turned and walked from the locker room without further communication.

"我要走了。" 她说完便转身离开了更衣室，没有再多说什么。

"Thanks for that Wondergirl." Asuka said blowing a sigh into to the now empty locker room. "It's been educational!"

"谢谢你，神奇女孩。" 明日香说着，在空无一人的更衣室里叹了口气。"真是受益匪浅！"

"I see that your dietary habits haven't changed."

看来你的饮食习惯还是没变。

"You're starting to sound like Ritsuko." Misato griped as she kept spooning the contents of the jar of chilli flakes into her bowl of cafeteria ramen.

"你开始听起来像律子了。" 美里一边抱怨，一边继续将那罐辣椒片一勺勺地舀进她的食堂拉面碗里。

Kaji grimaced as he took a swig of his coffee. "Well, as usual, I've got to say that I can't fault her logic." He replied dryly. "After all, it is only 10:30am."

加治喝了一口咖啡，皱起了眉头。“嗯，一如既往，我得说她的逻辑无可挑剔。”他干巴巴地回答道，“毕竟，现在才上午十点半。”

The major just 'hmphed' at her former lover as she screwed the lid back on the jar and began slurping the soup out of the bowl. "For you perhaps. You haven't been up since 5am pulling the early shift. For me this is a late lunch!"

她对前情人只是“哼”了一声，旋紧了罐子的盖子，开始从碗里啜饮汤。“对你来说可能是。你可没从早上 5 点开始就上早班。对我来说，这可是顿晚午餐！”

The pony-tailed agent pursed his lips and watched as Misato made short work of demolishing the questionable meal in front of her. While she finished he took a quick head count of the other occupants of the NERV cafeteria. At this time of the morning the cavernous space was virtually deserted. A couple of maintenance workers slouched over their mid morning coffees in the far corner, three of the back-up bridge staff chatted and joked as they ate from their metal lunch trays and that was pretty much it.

马尾特工抿着嘴唇，看着葛城美里迅速解决了面前那顿可疑的餐食。在她吃完的同时，他快速清点了 NERV 食堂里的其他人员。清晨时分，这个宽敞的空间几乎空无一人。角落里，几名维修工懒洋洋地喝着上午的咖啡，三名备用指挥桥人员边吃着金属餐盘里的食物边聊天打趣，除此之外，再无他人。

Kaji had done several surreptitious sweeps of the base after he had arrived in Tokyo-3 and had been surprised to discover that the cafeteria was a black hole insofar as Section 2 surveillance was concerned. The space was too open and public for anyone to pay it much notice as a venue for possible espionage. So in many ways it was the perfect place for the meeting that Kaji had in mind.

加治抵达东京-3 后，曾暗中对基地进行了几次搜查，意外发现食堂在第二部门的监视下竟是个盲区。这个空间过于开放和公共，以至于没人会将其视为可能的间谍活动场所。因此，从很多方面来看，它正是加治心目中理想的会面地点。

Finally Misato slurped up the last of the noodles left in the bowl and looked up at Kaji who sat patiently waiting for her.

最终，葛城美里吸完了碗里剩下的最后一根面条，抬头望向耐心等待她的加持。

"So," She said, wiping her face and hands on a paper napkin with a red half leaf logo in the corner. "Why did you want to meet me here? I'm guessing that it's not to reminisce about the old days and watch me eat ramen."

“那么，”她说着，用一张角落印有红色半叶标志的纸巾擦拭着脸和手，“你为什么想在这里见我？我猜不是为了怀旧叙旧，看我吃拉面吧。”

"Well, not entirely." Kaji replied with a smile. "Though it has been fun so far."

"嗯，也不尽然。" 薰微笑着回答，"虽然到目前为止还是挺有趣的。"

"Har-de-har." Misato answered dryly.

"哈哈。" 葛城美里干巴巴地回答道。

Kaji glanced around as the maintenance workers pushed their chairs back with loud metallic scraping noises and shuffled out of the cafeteria, presumably heading back to their shifts in the Evangelion bays.

卡吉环顾四周，维修工人们推着椅子发出刺耳的金属摩擦声，纷纷离开食堂，大概是回往福音战士机库继续他们的轮班。

"You seem a little on edge." The purple haired Major said. "What's going on Kaji? Has one of your ex-girlfriends caught up with you and started demanding paternity payments?"

"你看起来有点紧张。"紫发少校说道，"怎么了，卡吉？是不是哪个前女友追上来了，开始要求支付抚养费了？"

"You know that you were always the only girl for me Misato!" Kaji said turning on his easy charm. She poked her tongue out at his glib response.

"你知道你一直是我的唯一，美里！" 加持说着，轻松地施展他的魅力。她对他的油嘴滑舌吐了吐舌头。

The spy quickly grew more sombre and leaned forward across the table. "Misato..." He said in a serious tone. "Has Asuka been acting… you know, kind of weird or unusual lately?"

间谍的神色迅速变得阴沉，他俯身越过桌子，语气严肃地说：“Misato...”他问道，“Asuka 最近有没有表现得…你知道的，有点奇怪或不寻常？”

"Asuka?" Misato said in surprise. "I guess she's been a little moody lately. Not that that's anything unusual in itself… She's a highly strung teenage girl with a lot of pressure on her. You've gotta expect all of that weight on her shoulders to cause her to cause her to give vent to a little steam from time to time!"

"明日香？" 葛城惊讶地说道，"我猜她最近有点情绪化。不过这本身也没什么不寻常的……她是个压力很大的紧张少女。你得预料到她肩上的重担会时不时让她发泄一下！"

"Hmmm.." Kaji replied. "You do know that she asked me to meet her at a café downtown before the synch-tests yesterday?"

"嗯……" 卡吉回答道，"你可知道她昨天同步测试前约我在市中心的一家咖啡馆见面？"

"Did she?" Misato asked with an amused smile. "You of all people should remember that she has had a crush on you for a long time now. I would have thought that an experienced Don Juan like you would have no problem letting an infatuated young girl down gently." She teased.

"她真的这么做了吗？" 美里带着戏谑的笑容问道，"你这种情场老手应该记得，她对你倾心已久。我还以为像你这样的唐璜，拒绝一个痴情的少女会轻而易举呢。" 她调侃道。

"I'm not talking about a bit of teenaged angst or schoolgirl crush or anything remotely like that." Kaji replied tensely. "She said that she had asked to meet because she wanted to warn me."

"我说的不是那种青少年的小情绪或是女学生的迷恋，或者任何与之类似的东西。" 薰紧张地回答，"她说她要求见面，是因为她想警告我。"

The Major met his intense stare with a questioning look. "Warn you?"

少校以询问的眼神迎上他那炽热的目光，反问道：“警告你？”

Kaji did another quick nervous head check around the cafeteria.

加治再次迅速紧张地环视了一圈食堂。

"What's wrong with you Kaji?" Misato asked worriedly. "You're acting like the Stasi are about to swoop in and nab you!"

"你怎么了，加持？" 惣流担心地问道，"你这副样子，好像史塔西随时会冲进来抓你似的！"

"Maybe I am… but I have my reasons." The agent said with a wry smile, before again growing very serious. "Misato, what do you know about the Human Instrumentality Project?"

“或许我是……但我有我的理由。”特工苦笑着说，随后又变得非常严肃。“真嗣，你对人类补完计划了解多少？”

"The Human what Project?"

"人类什么项目？"

"Exactly." Kaji said. "It's Top Secret level S12 clearance information that I've only just barely been able to scratch the surface of. As far as I can tell, it appears to be the driving force behind Project E and the entire Evangelion program itself."

"正是如此。" 卡吉说道，"这是 S12 级最高机密信息，我仅能略窥一二。据我所知，它似乎是 E 计划乃至整个新世纪福音战士项目背后的推动力。"

"W-What's this have to do with Asuka?"

"这和明日香有什么关系？"

"I told you that she said that she had wanted to warn me. She told me that I should go back to Germany before things got "too bad", whatever that meant. She also told me, and I quote; "If you keep poking around the Human Instrumentality Project, they're gonna kill you Kaji.""

我告诉过你，她说她本想警告我。她告诉我，我应该在事情变得“太糟”之前回德国，不管那意味着什么。她还告诉我，我引用她的话：“如果你继续探究人类补完计划，他们会杀了你，加持。”

Misato looked at him incredulously. "That has to be a mistake. If this Instrumentality thing is as Top Secret and high level as you say it is… There's just no way… I mean I haven't even heard of it!" The Major sputtered. "You're not bullshitting me here Ryouji? How could a fourteen year old girl… ?"

美里难以置信地看着他。“这一定是搞错了。如果这个‘人类补完计划’真的像你说的那样是绝密且高层级的……这根本不可能……我甚至都没听说过！”少校结巴地说道。“你不是在跟我开玩笑吧，真嗣？一个十四岁的女孩怎么可能……？”

"Exactly." Kaji interrupted. "She couldn't. You've just shown me that you don't know anything about this, so where did she find out about it?"

"正是如此。" 加治打断道，"她不可能知道。你刚才已经向我证明了你对这件事一无所知，那她又是从哪里得知的呢？"

"And what makes her so convinced that you're "poking around" in it?"

是什么让她如此确信你在“四处打探”这件事？

"Those are my questions exactly Misato." The agent replied. "Asuka's a smart kid, her constant bragging isn't just some childish act. The kid's a certified genius! Even so, how could she possibly know about this kind of stuff?"

"那些正是我想问的，碇。" 特工回答道，"明日香是个聪明的孩子，她不断的自夸并非仅仅是孩子气的表现。这孩子是个公认的天才！即便如此，她怎么可能知道这类事情呢？"

"I… I don't have the faintest idea." Misato answered perplexed.

"我……我一点头绪都没有。" 碇真嗣困惑地回答道。

"Neither do I. But I do know one thing. If she lets anyone else know about this her life is in terrible danger. I told her as much yesterday. You know what she said?"

我也是。但我确实知道一件事。如果她让其他人知道这件事，她的生命将面临极大的危险。我昨天就是这么告诉她的。你知道她怎么说的吗？

"What?" "什么？"

"She said, "They've already killed me once already… I think I can risk it! " When I asked her what she meant she just said that she was just kidding, but it seemed to be kind of like it was some kind of a sad memory for her when she said it."

她说：“他们已经杀过我一次了……我想我可以冒这个险！”当我问她是什么意思时，她只是说她只是在开玩笑，但当她说这话时，似乎对她来说是一种悲伤的回忆。

"I don't understand any of this Kaji!" Misato said in a hushed tone.

"我一点儿也不明白，加持！" 葛城美里低声说道。

"Neither do I Misato." Kaji replied. "I want you to keep an eye on Asuka for me… I don't know where she's getting this information, but if she's not careful she could be in grave danger."

"我也是，美里。" 加持回答道，"我想请你帮我留意一下明日香……我不知道她从哪里得到这些信息的，但如果她不小心，可能会陷入极大的危险。"

"You want me to spy on her, snoop through her stuff? I can't do that Kaji! I've worked hard to gain her trust and co-operation, if she finds out I'm spying on her I can kiss that all goodbye!"

你想让我监视她，窥探她的私人物品吗？我做不到，卡吉！我费了很大劲才赢得她的信任和合作，如果她发现我在监视她，那一切就都完了！

"Better to lose her trust than for her to lose her life! I'm serious Misato! She could be in great danger because of this."

失去她的信任总好过让她失去生命！我是认真的，美里！她可能会因此陷入极大的危险。

"You don't understand, I… "

"你不明白，我……"

Misato's reply was interrupted by the shrill beeping of her NERV pager. The Major plucked the small electronic device off her belt and quickly read the text on the tiny screen.

美里的话被她的 NERV 寻呼机尖锐的哔哔声打断了。少校从腰带上取下这个小电子设备，迅速阅读了小屏幕上的文字。

"Speaking of putting children in the path of danger…" She said standing up from her chair. "An unidentified object has just been reported in the airspace above Tokyo-3."

说到让孩子处于危险之中……"她从椅子上站起来说道，"刚刚有报告称，在第三新东京市上空发现了一个不明物体。"

"An Angel?" Kaji asked.

"一个天使？" 卡吉问道。

"Well I somehow doubt that it's a runaway Gumby balloon from the last Hallowe'en parade!"

嗯，我总觉得那不可能是去年万圣节游行中逃走的古比气球！

At that moment the klaxons of the main Angel Alert alarm began their deafening bellowing. Once again warning the citizens of Tokyo-3 and surrounding areas that their city was yet again the target of impending destruction.

那一刻，主天使警报的汽笛开始发出震耳欲聋的吼声，再次警告东京 3 号及其周边地区的居民，他们的城市又一次成为即将到来的毁灭目标。

"We'll talk about this later!" Misato yelled over the sirens before scurrying off to the direct lifts to Central Dogma.

"这事我们回头再谈！" 在警报声中，葛城美里大声喊道，随后匆匆赶往直达中央教条的电梯。

Kaji skulled the last of his tepid coffee. "Assuming that there is a 'later." He muttered to himself as he also headed off to his pre-ordained emergency station.

加治喝完了他那杯温热的咖啡，喃喃自语：“假设还有‘以后’的话。”随后，他也前往了预定的紧急集合点。

Within a few short minutes the entire facility was locked down. Pilots were rushed from their school to NERV in large black saloon cars. The Bridge crew sat poised to react to whatever form the attack from the new interloper may take. Non-essential staff huddled in their cramped shelters. Many of them staring at creased and fingered photographs of loved ones taken out of wallets or held in small frames that they had brought from desks and workstations. Universally all of them were praying that the end would not come for them on this day.

短短几分钟内，整个设施便进入了封锁状态。飞行员们被从学校紧急送往 NERV 总部，乘坐的是大型黑色轿车。指挥桥上的工作人员严阵以待，准备应对新入侵者可能发起的任何形式的攻击。非关键岗位的员工们挤在狭小的避难所里，许多人凝视着从钱包中取出或从办公桌、工作站带来的小相框中皱巴巴、被手指触摸过的亲人照片。他们无一不在祈祷，希望今天不会是他们的末日。

End Chapter 7 第七章结束

A/N: 作者注：

Alright then! :) 好的，那就这样吧！:)

I had planned to do this chapter all the way through the Angel battle, but at already roughly seven thousand words I thought I might finish this one off at this point and devote the proper amount of space and time to the crucial first Angel battle that Asuka is a part of in her new timeline!

我原本计划将这一章一直写到天使战斗结束，但考虑到已经大约七千字了，我想或许可以在此告一段落，以便为新时间线中与明日香息息相关的重要首次天使战斗留出足够的篇幅和时间

Sorry for it being all buildup and no action, all mouth and no trousers, so to speak! it was initially intended to be the opening movements of a very important chapter, but it kinda took on a life, and size, of its own! Even after two rewrites I'm not completely happy with it, but it's gone beyond my abilities to improve, so I put it out there!

抱歉，这全是铺垫而没有行动，可以说是光说不练！最初本打算作为非常重要章节的开篇，但它似乎有了自己的生命和规模！即便经过两次重写，我仍不完全满意，但已超出了我的改进能力，所以就让它面世吧！

I also realise some of you may see discrepancies within Rei's behaviours and perceived motivations in relation to earlier events, these should be addressed later in the story. Depending on if I have the skill to pull off that particular story-arc!

我也意识到你们中的一些人可能会发现零的行为和与早期事件相关的动机之间存在差异，这些问题将在故事后面得到解决。这取决于我是否有能力完成那个特定的故事情节！

Chapter 8 is already well under way, so it shouldn't be too long until the all important battle is underway. Thanks, in advance, for your patience!

第八章已经顺利进行中，因此至关重要的战斗应该不会太久就会展开。提前感谢您的耐心等待！

Cheers! 干杯！

Donderkind. 唐德金德。

## Chapter 8 Falls the Shadow

第 8 章：影落时分

As always I make no claims of ownership of anything Evangelion related.

一如既往，我并不声称拥有任何与《新世纪福音战士》相关的所有权。

Also this fic is rated M, mostly for language. Just to let you know, Asuka does get her swear on a bit in this particular chapter!

此外，这部作品被定为 M 级，主要是由于语言。提前告知，在这一章节中，明日香确实会有些粗口！

Unbroken 坚不可摧

Chapter Eight 第八章

Falls the Shadow… 阴影之下……

"Hello, Mother." She said quietly, so as not to be overheard by the cage crew of her unit as they swarmed around the giant like ants.

"你好，妈妈。" 她轻声说道，以免被她单位里像蚂蚁一样忙碌的机组成员听到。

Unit 02 just stood dumbly before her as she leaned on the rail of the gangway in front of it. Asuka smiled to herself. What did she expect? Especially after the near disaster of yesterday's synch-test. For it to stoop down and kiss her on the forehead?

零号机二号机只是呆呆地站在她面前，而她则倚靠在它前面的舷梯栏杆上。明日香暗自微笑。她期待什么呢？尤其是在昨天的同步测试差点酿成灾难之后。难道期待它弯下腰来亲吻她的额头吗？

Nonetheless, it was still strangely comforting to see the bright red Evangelion towering above her once more after all of this time. The gleaming perfection of its form in stark contrast to the bloody violence of its death.

尽管如此，在这么久之后再次看到那鲜红色的福音战士巍然耸立在她的上方，仍然有一种莫名的安慰感。它那闪耀着完美光芒的身躯与它死亡时的血腥暴力形成了鲜明对比。

The entry plug was finally lowered down to her level and she quickly climbed inside and nestled herself into the seat. Almost immediately she felt the stomach dropping sensation of the crane lifting the plug up into position above Unit 02's neck. The main hatch slid forward and sealed the plug shut with a soft thud.

插入栓终于被降到了她的高度，她迅速爬进去，舒适地坐进座位。几乎立刻，她感受到了起重机将插入栓吊起至零号机颈部位置时那种胃部下坠的感觉。主舱门向前滑动，伴随着一声轻柔的砰响，将插入栓密封起来。

She was aware of her hands flexing and unflexing on the control yokes as she tried to still the nervous tension of what would be her first combat sortie in over a year, at least by her own time frame. Not to mention that the last time that she had actually been inside this very same entry plug she had be impaled and dismembered by the unholy horde of the Mass Production Evangelion Series.

她意识到自己的手在控制杆上紧握又放松，试图平息因即将到来的超过一年时间（至少按她自己的时间线）的首次战斗任务而产生的紧张情绪。更不用说，上一次她进入这个插入栓时，她曾被量产型福音战士系列的邪恶大军刺穿并肢解。

"Commencing LCL delivery." The tinny voice of Lt Ibuki sounded over the plug speakers.

"开始 LCL 输送。" 微弱的声音通过插入栓的扬声器传来，那是伊吹二尉的声音。

"Keep it together, Asuka." She whispered to herself as the familiar sensation of LCL immersion swept over her body.

"坚持住，明日香。" 她轻声自语，同时熟悉的 LCL 浸没感笼罩了她的身体。

"Inserting Entry Plug." 插入入口插头。

The cushioning effects of the pressurised liquid that she was now immersed in meant that there was very little sensation to tell her of the torque of the plug as it was rapidly thrust into the opening in the carapace of the Evangelion.

她现在沉浸在加压液体中的缓冲效果意味着，当插头迅速插入福音战士外壳上的开口时，几乎没有感觉能告诉她插头所承受的扭矩。

"Beginning Start-up Sequence."

开始启动序列。

Asuka felt an electric thrill across her body as the LCL was electrolysed, shortly followed by the kaleidoscope of colour as the plug and Eva connected. Then there was the familiar sensation of her limbs growing heavy and puissant as the mechanoid bonded with her. She had been a little apprehensive as to how Unit 02 would react to having her actually inside it, unfiltered by the Sim-bodies, but the now Evangelion was quiet and she could feel none of the sturm und drang from it of the synch-test the day before. Indeed the spirit inside the beast seemed almost somnolent compared to last time. Asuka drew its essence close to her as the walls of the plug disappeared and the interior of the cage filled her view.

明日香感到一股电流穿过身体，LCL 被电解，紧接着是插入栓与 Eva 连接时色彩斑斓的万花筒景象。随后，她熟悉地感觉到四肢变得沉重而有力，机械装置与她结合。她对零号机在自己真正进入其中、未经模拟身体过滤的情况下会有何反应有些忐忑，但此刻的福音战士却异常平静，她感觉不到前一天同步测试中的狂风暴雨。事实上，这只野兽体内的精神几乎比上次还要昏昏欲睡。明日香将其本质拉近自己，插入栓的墙壁消失，笼子的内部充满了她的视野。

"Stabilised at sixty-two percent." The young tech's voice filled her ears. Asuka breathed a sigh of relief, causing a few small bubbles to rise into the liquid. A marginal improvement, but comforting nonetheless. At this level she knew she could at easily control Unit 02 and have a better effect on the outcome of this battle.

"稳定在百分之六十二。"年轻技术员的声音充斥着她的耳朵。明日香松了一口气，几串小气泡随之升入液体中。虽是微小的进步，却也令人感到安慰。在这个水平上，她知道自己能轻松控制二号机，并对这场战斗的结果产生更积极的影响。

At least she hoped she could.

至少她希望自己能做到。

In truth, the mere fact of her now actually sitting once again inside the Evangelion was so surreal that she wasn't even able to fully get her brain around it. She chewed the inside of her cheek painfully just to help her stay focused on the task at hand.

事实上，她此刻真的再次坐在了福音战士内，这种感觉如此超现实，以至于她甚至无法完全让自己的思绪跟上。她痛苦地咬着脸颊内侧，只是为了帮助自己集中精力应对眼前的任务。

Asuka could hear the chatter over the open link channels of all three Evangelions being prepped for battle. She grimaced slightly as she heard Misato verbally fussing over Shinji as Unit 01 was brought to the launch bay. Despite all that had occurred, she still felt a small twinge of jealousy at the relationship that her two housemates shared. A relationship that she could never have hoped to be a part of. Even more now she felt like the outsider. A lonely freak that others could never understand or relate to.

明日香能听到所有三台正在备战中的 Evangelions 通过开放链接频道的嘈杂声。当她听到美里在口头上对真嗣喋喋不休，而零号机被带到发射舱时，她微微皱了皱眉。尽管发生了那么多事，她仍然对她的两个室友之间的关系感到一丝嫉妒。那是一种她从未奢望能成为其中一部分的关系。现在，她感觉自己更像是一个局外人，一个别人永远无法理解或与之共鸣的孤独怪胎。

"How the fuck am I gonna do this?" She muttered to herself.

"我他妈要怎么搞这个？" 她自言自语道。

"Sorry Asuka, what did you say?" Misato's voice was suddenly loud in her ears.

"对不起，明日香，你说什么了？" 美里突然在她耳边大声说道。

"Errrm… I said, come on, let's do this!"

"呃……我说，来吧，我们开始吧！"

"That-a-girl!" Misato cheered in reply.

"好样的！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷回应道。

Asuka fought to control her emotions as she felt the Eva being rolled on its giant mobile platform to the launch catapult. She felt the familiar seismic thunk of the lock bolts pushing into place.

明日香努力控制着自己的情绪，当她感觉到 Eva 被巨大的移动平台运送到发射弹射器上时。她感受到了熟悉的震动，那是锁定螺栓推入到位时的声音。

"Are you sure that you're good to go, Asuka?" Misato asked over them comm.

"你确定准备好了吗，明日香？" 美里通过通讯问道。

The redhead tightened her grip on the butterfly handles as she prepared for the G-forces of the launch.

红发女子在准备迎接发射时的重力加速度时，紧紧握住了蝴蝶形把手。

"Let's do this!" She snarled out.

"咱们就这么干！" 她厉声说道。

The LCL provided some cushioning effect but she still felt her body sinking into the memory foam of her seat as Unit 02 accelerated to over two hundred kilometres an hour, making it up to street level in a matter of mere seconds.

LCL 提供了一些缓冲效果，但她仍感觉到身体沉入座椅的记忆泡沫中，随着二号机加速至每小时两百多公里，仅用数秒便升至街道水平。

After she recovered from the jolt of the sudden stop at the surface Asuka quickly gained her bearings. It had been a long time since she had seen the city from the lofty vantage point of the cockpit of an Evangelion and she marvelled at how clean and shining and alive Tokyo-3 appeared as it lay before her. Even with the buildings at the centre of the city retracted the centre of Tokyo-3 shimmered in the bright early afternoon sunlight. Off to either side of her position she could see the other two Evas moving out from their insertion points. Unit 00 retrieving what appeared to be a large sniper rifle from a close-by armament tower and Unit 01 already with the ridiculously huge automatic pistol clasped in its right hand. She stepped forward and off the launch platform as she quickly inserted one of the power couplings from a nearby service building.

在经历了突然停机带来的冲击后，明日香很快恢复了方向感。她已经很久没有从初号机的驾驶舱这个高处俯瞰这座城市了，眼前的第三新东京市显得如此干净、闪亮且充满生机，让她不禁赞叹。尽管市中心的高楼已经收缩，但在明媚的午后阳光下，第三新东京市的中心区域依旧熠熠生辉。在她两侧，可以看到另外两台 EVA 正从各自的部署点出发。零号机从附近的武装塔上取下了一把看似巨大的狙击步枪，而初号机则已经握着那把夸张的巨型自动手枪在右手。她向前迈步，离开了发射平台，并迅速从附近的服务建筑中接入了一条电源线。

Hovering serenely about two kilometres distant was the familiar zebra striped sphere of the Angel, which had appeared about twenty minutes earlier above the western quarter of the city and had shown no real sign of movement since then.

在约两公里外宁静地悬浮着的是那个熟悉的斑马条纹球体——天使，它大约二十分钟前出现在城市的西侧，自那以后几乎没有显示出任何移动的迹象。

"Asuka, move out." Misato's face appeared in a com-screen. "Armament building A-7 will be on your left in 120 metres, I think you'll like what you find in there!"

"明日香，出发。" 美里出现在通讯屏幕上。"武器库 A-7 将在你左侧 120 米处，我想你会喜欢那里的东西的！"

Asuka walked the Eva forward down the specially reinforced roadway. As she reached the designated spot a narrow building shot up out of the pavement to her left and the side of it retracted to reveal the usual array of armaments inside, plus a titanium shafted progressive battleaxe that shone in the sunlight.

明日香驾驶着 Eva 沿着特别加固的道路前行。当她到达指定位置时，左侧的路面上突然升起一座狭长的建筑，其侧面展开，露出了内部常规的武器装备，还有一把在阳光下闪闪发光的钛合金柄渐进式战斧。

Asuka grinned at seeing it. It was always the coolest weapon that she had used during her time as a pilot, but she had never actually used it in anger on an Angel due to the way things went down the toilet on that particular day.

明日香看到它时咧嘴笑了。这是她担任驾驶员期间使用过的最酷的武器，但由于那天事情一团糟，她从未真正愤怒地对天使使用过它。

'This particular day!' She thought soberly to herself. She grabbed the axe from its rack and hefted its weight in her Eva's hands. It felt reassuringly solid and powerful in her grip. "Ikuhayo Asuka!" She whispered, before saying more loudly. "This is much more like it Misato!"

“这一天可真特别！”她冷静地想。她从架子上抓起斧头，在手中掂量着它的重量。握在手里，它给人一种坚实而有力的安心感。“走吧，明日香！”她低声说道，然后更大声地说：“这才是我想要的，美里！”

The Major smiled at her, before returning to a more serious demeanour.

少校对她微笑了一下，然后又恢复了严肃的态度。

"We'll do this just like we discussed in the briefing." Misato said to the three pilots. "We have no idea what this Angel's offensive capabilities are, so while one of you tries to get close enough to it to gauge what it can do, the others will hold back to assist if need be. Unit 00 is better suited to ranged attacks, so Rei will set up at point A14 with the sniper rifle while Asuka in Unit 02… "

“我们将按照简报中讨论的那样执行。” 葛城对三位驾驶员说道，“我们不清楚这个使徒的攻击能力，因此当其中一人试图接近它以评估其能力时，其他人将保持距离以备支援。零号机更适合远程攻击，所以绫波将在 A14 点架设狙击步枪，而明日香驾驶的二号机……”

"I'll take point!" Asuka interrupted, keen to put Shinji as far from harm's way as she could.

"我来打头阵！" 明日香打断道，急于将真嗣尽可能地置于安全之地。

"Shinji will take point." Misato continued sternly. "As highest Synch holder we are better served by having him at point. Unit 02 will back him up."

"真嗣将担任先锋。" 美里严肃地继续说道，"作为同步率最高者，让他打头阵对我们更有利。二号机将支援他。"

"Yes Ma'am." Shinji answered. "After all combat's a man's job, Asuka! It's just good tactics to put your best pilot at the point where he can be the most effective."

"是的，女士。" 真嗣回答道，"毕竟战斗是男人的工作，明日香！将最优秀的飞行员放在他能发挥最大效能的位置，这只是良好的战术安排。"

"At last he speaks!" Asuka said in annoyance and more than a little panic. "What was that, chauvinist piglet? Who gave you permission to turn into an asshole? I will take point!"

"他终于开口了！"明日香带着恼怒和些许惊慌说道，"你说什么，沙文主义小猪？谁允许你变成混蛋的？我来打头阵！"

"Asuka…" Misato started. "明日香……" 葛城开口道。

"After all," Asuka continued. "Doesn't it make more sense to put your most expendable pilot in harm's way and so that the heroic highest synch holding pilot of Unit 01 can rush in and save the poor little girl from the big nasty Angel? Wouldn't you agree, Doctor Akagi?"

“毕竟，”明日香继续说道，“让最可牺牲的驾驶员去冒险，然后让与零号机拥有最高同步率的英雄驾驶员冲进去，从那只大恶魔天使手中救出可怜的小女孩，这样不是更合理吗？你不同意吗，赤木博士？”

From behind Misato on the com window Asuka could see Ritsuko Akagi staring daggers at her.

在通讯窗口中，站在美里身后的明日香可以看到赤木律子正用锐利的目光盯着她。

"We don't have time for this Asuka!" The Major griped at her.

"我们没时间应付这个，明日香！" 少校对她抱怨道。

"You know that I would be best suited to the offensive role, Misato! Give me a chance to show you that I can take it! Otherwise what was the point of giving me this axe, no matter how cool it may be, when the other two have got ranged weapons?" Asuka was almost pleading now. "Give me the point, Misato, and that Angel's innards will be pâté before you even know it!"

你知道我最适合进攻角色，美里！给我一个机会证明我能胜任！否则，无论这把斧头有多酷，另外两人都有远程武器，给我这把斧头又有什么意义呢？"明日香几乎是在恳求了。"给我这个机会，美里，我保证那使徒的内脏在你反应过来之前就会变成肉酱！"

"Asuka…" Misato began. "明日香……" 美里开口道。

"Come on, Misato!" There was a desperate edge to the redhead's voice. "Which pilot has the most advanced training in weapons and tactics out of the three of us?"

"快点，美里！"红发女子的声音中带着绝望的边缘，"我们三个人中，谁的武器和战术训练最先进？"

"We don't have time for a childish squabble now Asuka!" The Major said in frustration.

"我们现在没时间进行幼稚的争吵，明日香！" 少校恼火地说道。

"Exactly!" Asuka answered as if Misato had just proven her point. "That's why the most experienced pilot should be given the point position! Acing tests in a lab doesn't count for much if you can't cut it in the real world!"

"没错！"明日香回答道，仿佛美里刚刚证明了她的观点。"这就是为什么最有经验的飞行员应该担任领航位置！在实验室里考试得满分，如果不能在现实世界中胜任，那也没多大意义！"

"Asuka can take the point if it means that much to her!" Shinji interrupted his two housemate's argument surlily.

"如果这对她来说那么重要，明日香可以占据上风！" 真嗣不悦地打断了他两位室友的争论。

"Thanks, Shinji-kun! Your such a team player!" Asuka replied, masking her relief with heavy sarcasm.

"谢谢你，真嗣君！你真是团队的一员啊！" 明日香回答道，用浓重的讽刺掩饰了自己的宽慰。

"Fine, Asuka will take point, Shinji will back her up." Misato said in a frustrated tone.

"好吧，明日香打头阵，真嗣支援她。" 美里带着一丝沮丧的语气说道。

Asuka stuck her tongue out and pulled her left eyelid down at Shinji's image in the communications window. The Third Child looked annoyed for a moment before finally changing to a more resigned expression. "Yes Misato. Unit 01 will back up."

明日香对着通讯窗口中真嗣的影像吐了吐舌头，拉下左眼皮。第三适格者一开始显得有些恼火，但最终还是换上了一副更加无奈的表情。“好的，美里。零号机会支援的。”

"Unit 00 will back up too." Rei's monotone sounded over the speakers.

"零号机也会进行备份。"绫波的声音通过扬声器传来，依旧毫无起伏。

Flicking the com windows off with a thought Asuka allowed herself a little smile of victory. Finally something was going her way. Now all that she had to do was defeat this Angel and prevent Shinji from falling into the Dirac sea and things could begin falling into place for her. This battle was for her the crux of her plan to try and prevent Shinji from plummeting into despair. Something in her mind told her that this had to be the crucial turning point that Lilith had selected for her. She knew that what Shinji had experienced inside the 12th Angel was the beginning of the end for him psychologically, and therefore Humanity as well. If she screwed up on this mission she felt that it would be so much more difficult to prevent Third Impact.

用意念关闭通讯窗口，明日香允许自己露出一丝胜利的微笑。终于，事情开始朝着她期望的方向发展了。现在，她所要做的就是击败这个使徒，阻止真嗣坠入狄拉克之海，然后一切就能开始步入正轨。这场战斗对她而言，是她试图阻止真嗣陷入绝望的计划的关键。她内心深处有个声音告诉她，这一定是莉莉丝为她选定的转折点。她知道，真嗣在第十二使徒体内的经历，是他心理崩溃的开始，也因此是人类末日的开端。如果这次任务搞砸了，她觉得阻止第三次冲击将会变得更加困难。

It all sounded simple in her head. She wished that she could feel the confidence that it would actually be that easy.

这一切在她脑海中听起来很简单。她希望自己能感受到那种事情真的会如此容易的信心。

Holding the axe in both of the Eva's hands in a way that it strangely couldn't but help to remind her of the days of trekking through the frozen wastes with her trusty ancient rifle, Asuka tried her best to move as stealthily through the deserted streets as the forty metre tall robot would allow.

伊娃双手紧握斧头，这姿势奇怪地让她不禁回想起与那把可靠的古老步枪一同跋涉于冰封荒原的日子。阿苏卡竭尽全力，让这四十米高的机器人尽可能悄无声息地穿行在荒凉的街道上。

Just as she got to within about one hundred metres of where the Angel floated serenely over the deserted cityscape she felt a sharp tug at her back.

就在她接近天使宁静悬浮于荒凉城市景观上方约一百米处时，她感到背后突然传来一阵剧烈的拉扯。

"Scheiße." She swore to herself as she realised that she had been caught up in exactly the same way as the last time she had been here. She quickly ejected the power coupling and accessed as new one from a nearby access point. She certainly hoped that history wouldn't be repeating itself any further.

"该死。" 她暗自咒骂，意识到自己再次陷入了与上次来这里时相同的境地。她迅速拔掉电源接头，并从附近的一个接入点取用了一个新的。她真心希望历史不要再重演。

Finally she positioned Unit 02 with its back to the building nearest the Angel's position and peered around the side at her enemy. It still hung there above the evacuated city, its seamless striped surface free from flaw or apparent weak point.

最终，她将二号机背对距离使徒最近的大楼，从侧面窥视着敌人。使徒依旧悬挂在被疏散的城市上空，其条纹表面完美无瑕，找不到任何缺陷或明显的弱点。

She waited until she heard the confirmations of the other two Evangelions reaching their pre-determined positions. There would be no going off half-cocked this time around.

她一直等到确认另外两台福音战士到达预定位置的消息传来。这次绝不能再草率行事了。

"Unit 00 in position." "单位 00 已就位。"

"Unit 01 in position." "单位 01 已就位。"

"Alright, Asuka." Misato's tension filled voice sounded in her cockpit speakers. "The Magi are yet to confirm this thing's wave pattern, so we're unsure of its status or capabilities…"

"好了，明日香。" 美里紧张的声音从她的驾驶舱扬声器中传来，"三贤人系统尚未确认这个东西的波形，所以我们还不清楚它的状态或能力……"

"How is that any different from normal?" Asuka replied in a tense whisper.

"那和平时有什么不同？" 明日香紧张地低声回答。

"I'm just saying be careful, don't commit fully to an attack until we're sure what we're dealing with here."

我只是想说要小心，在我们确定面对的是什么之前，不要全力发起攻击。

"So we just stand around until it decides to attack us?" Asuka said incredulously. "I see why they made you Operations Director!" Asuka always felt that sarcasm was one of her real strengths.

"所以我们只能傻站着等它决定攻击我们吗？" 明日香难以置信地说道，"我算是明白为什么让你当作战指挥了！" 明日香一直觉得讽刺是她的真正强项之一。

Misato didn't rise to the bait and stayed silent. Minutes seemed to drag by as the Angel remained motionless above them.

碇真嗣没有上当，保持沉默。天使在他们上方静止不动，时间仿佛变得缓慢。

"Status report." She heard Misato say to one of the bridge techs.

"状态报告。" 她听到碇真嗣对其中一个桥技术人员说。

"Target pattern still orange." Some anonymous peon replied.

目标图案仍是橙色。" 某位匿名小卒回答道。

Asuka assessed her situation. So far she had got herself into the point position like she had planned. Now the moment had arrived to force the situation. 'Fuck this, time to take charge!' She figured that if she could strike at it and make it attack her with its shadow she could get free by building hopping across that sinking skyscrapers and office blocks to safety, then the JSSDF could drop all of the N2 mines they wanted without having to risk Shinji's survival.

明日香评估了自己的处境。到目前为止，她已如计划般占据了有利位置。现在，是时候推动局势了。'去他的，该掌控局面了！'她认为，如果能攻击它并使其用影子攻击她，她就能通过在那些下沉的摩天大楼和办公楼间跳跃逃至安全地带，之后日本自卫队就可以随意投下所有 N2 地雷，无需再担心真嗣的安危。

At least that what she hoped would happen. If she got trapped inside the Dirac she had few illusions that she could make the dramatic last minute escape that Shinji had the last time around. Not to mention she had a sneaking suspicion that Dr Akagi and the Commander would be more than happy to order in the air-strike against her.

至少她是这么希望的。如果她被困在迪拉克内部，她对能像上次真嗣那样在最后一刻戏剧性地逃脱不抱多少幻想。更不用说她有一种隐约的预感，赤木博士和指挥官会很乐意下令对她进行空袭。

"Unit 02, moving out!" She called over the com.

"二号机，出动！" 她通过通讯器呼叫道。

"Roger." Misato's reply surprised Asuka. She had expected some resistance from the Major to her going out there alone. "Units Zero and One standby."

"收到。" 美里简洁的回答让明日香感到意外。她本以为这位少校会反对她独自前往。"零号机和一号机待命。"

'I bet if her precious Shinji was in my place she wouldn't let him go all alone out there.' She thought sourly to herself, briefly once again experiencing the bitter taste of jealousy.

她酸溜溜地想，要是她宝贝的 Shinji 处在我的位置，她肯定不会让他独自一人出去。嫉妒的苦涩滋味再次短暂地涌上心头。

Holding the battleaxe defensively in front of Unit 02 Asuka willed the Evangelion out from behind its hiding spot. She stood there, out in the open, for a few heart pounding seconds waiting for a response from the enemy.

手持战斧，防御性地站在 02 号机前，明日香驱使着这台福音战士从藏身之处走出。她站在开阔地带，心跳加速的几秒钟里，等待着敌人的回应。

Nothing happened. After a few more seconds she surmised that it appeared to be content to just hang there serenely above her. Asuka gripped the control handles tightly as she moved forward a few steps, making sure to keep the giant robot within easy reach of the remaining buildings in case she needed to jump free of the Angel's shadow. She frowned, 'Or is that over sized billiard ball up there the shadow? This Angel always confused me… Stupid Angel.'

什么也没发生。又过了几秒钟，她推测那东西似乎满足于只是静静地悬挂在她上方。明日香紧握控制手柄，向前走了几步，确保巨型机器人保持在剩余建筑物的便捷范围内，以防需要从天使的阴影中跳出。她皱起眉头，心想：“还是说，上面那个超大的台球才是阴影？这个天使总是让我困惑……愚蠢的天使。”

"What's the status on the target?" She asked over the com channel.

"目标的状况如何？" 她在通讯频道中问道。

"Unchanged." Was Misato's tense answer. "Waveform pattern still reading Orange."

"未改变。" 是 Misato 紧张的回答。"波形图仍然显示为橙色。"

"Moving forward." Asuka said, her mouth feeling dry despite the LCL. "Make sure you keep the other two in position, I don't want them blundering in and ruining everything!" She said in a desperate attempt to keep Unit 01 away from the Angel.

"继续前进。" 明日香说道，尽管有 LCL，她的嘴巴还是感到干燥。"确保另外两台保持位置，我不想他们鲁莽行事，毁了一切！" 她绝望地试图让初号机远离使徒。

Misato didn't reply. 美里没有回答。

Slowly Unit 02 moved towards the Angel. The city around her felt preternaturally still. Not even the faintest of breezes animated the air surrounding her Eva. Unconsciously Asuka hefted the axe in front of her Unit 02 as if she hoped to shield herself from the Angel's regard, while all of the time her eyes scanned the street before her for the faintest hint of the black shadow that only she knew was this messenger's most dangerous weapon.

缓缓地，二号机向使徒靠近。她周围的都市异常静谧，连一丝微风都未曾搅动环绕着她机体的空气。不自觉地，明日香将手中的斧头举在二号机前，仿佛希望以此抵挡使徒的注视，同时她的目光不断扫视着前方的街道，寻找那只有她知晓的、这位信使最危险的武器——黑色影子的微弱迹象。

Finally she was standing just in front of the black and white sphere. It loomed massively over her, many times larger than Unit 02. 'I don't remember it being this big.' She thought. 'But then I didn't get quite this close to it last time.'

最终，她站在了黑白相间的球体正前方。它巍峨地耸立在她面前，比二号机大了许多倍。'我不记得它有这么大。' 她心想。'但上次我并没有这么近地接近它。'

The Angel was in easy striking distance of her progressive battleaxe, she tensed herself, ready to deliver the first blow and then jump free of the shadow.

天使轻松地处于她那进步的战斧攻击范围内，她绷紧身体，准备发动第一击，随后跳出阴影的笼罩。

This close to the sphere the air seemed to crackle with tension and energy that radiated off of it. She could almost feel it observing her, not Unit 02 but her, as it hung impossibly in the air above her. Asuka closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath of LCL, feeling it soak her lungs with oxygen rich liquid before pushing it out smoothly and fluidly, in the way that only fully charged LCL seemed able to do.

靠近球体时，空气仿佛因紧张和能量而噼啪作响，这些能量从球体散发出来。她几乎能感觉到它在观察她，不是二号机，而是她自己，它不可思议地悬浮在她上方。明日香闭上眼睛片刻，深吸一口 LCL，感受着这种富含氧气的液体浸透她的肺部，然后顺畅而流畅地将其呼出，这种感觉只有完全充满电的 LCL 才能做到。

She opened her eyes again, the Angel filled her vision almost entirely now. She clasped the handle of the axe tightly, feeling its weight transmitted through the Evangelion's nerve links to her own arms. "Ikuhayo Asuka." She breathed into the LCL. Once she started to swing that axe, she knew that she would need all of her long forgotten skills and training to make it free of the shadow. The slightest slip or stumble would send her into the darkness of the Dirac. For her, she knew, there probably would not be a last minute escape before the bombs fell.

她再次睁开双眼，天使几乎完全占据了她的视野。她紧紧握住斧柄，感受到通过福音战士的神经链接传递到自己手臂上的重量。“要上了，明日香。”她对着 LCL 呼吸道。一旦开始挥动那把斧头，她明白自己需要运用所有早已遗忘的技能和训练，才能摆脱阴影的束缚。稍有差池或踉跄，她就会坠入狄拉克的黑暗之中。对她而言，她清楚，在炸弹落下之前，可能不会有最后一刻的逃脱机会。

Asuka began to raise the axe over Unit 02's head.

明日香开始将斧头举过二号机的头顶。

"Massive energy reading detected from within the Target!" She head Lieutenant Aoba call over the com channel. "Wavelength confirmed, Blue!"

"目标内部检测到巨大能量读数！"她听到青叶中尉在通讯频道上呼叫，"波长确认，蓝色！"

"Units 01 and 00, countermeasures!" Misato's voice sounded shrilly in her ears. "Protect Unit 02!"

"01 和 00 单位，采取反制措施！" 美里尖锐的声音在她耳边响起。"保护 02 单位！"

"No!" Asuka cried, caught by surprise by the sudden change in events. "Stay back!" Rapidly she swung the battleaxe in an arc over her head, but before she could hope to make contact with the orb a blast from Unit 00's sniper rifle crackled and split the air above her. Before it could even pierce the Angel's surface the sphere vanished into nothingness.

"不！" 明日香惊呼，被突变的事件惊得措手不及。"别过来！" 她迅速挥舞战斧在头顶划出一道弧线，但还未来得及触碰到那球体，零号机的狙击步枪便发出噼啪声，撕裂了她上方的空气。然而，在子弹穿透使徒表面之前，那球体已化为乌有。

"What the Hell?" Misato gasp of disbelief rang in the pilots' ears.

"搞什么鬼？" 美里难以置信的惊呼在飞行员们的耳边回响。

"Scheiße!" Asuka swore as the ground beneath her Evangelion turned into blackness. Desperately she buried the head of her battleaxe in the side of one of the rapidly sinking buildings by the side of the street. By this time her Unit 02 had vanished up to its knees in the shadow that was spreading across the city. She had expected that moving through the shadow would be akin to struggling through quicksand, or at least how she imagined quicksand would feel. Instead she could feel nothing from her own knees down, her legs still sat astride the pilot's seat, but due to her synchronisation with Unit 02, she had no sensation from them but a vague sense of coldness.

"该死！" 明日香咒骂着，她驾驶的初号机脚下的地面变成了漆黑一片。她绝望地将战斧头埋进街道旁一座正在迅速下沉的建筑物侧面。此时，她的二号机已经陷入了蔓延全城的阴影中，直至膝盖。她本以为在阴影中移动会像挣扎在流沙中，或者至少是她想象中流沙的感觉。然而，她从膝盖以下什么都感觉不到，双腿仍然跨坐在驾驶座上，但由于与二号机的同步，她只能感觉到一种模糊的寒冷。

"The shadow! The Angel is the shadow!" She heard Lieutenant Hyuga scream over the channel.

"影子！天使就是影子！" 她听到日向中尉在频道中尖叫。

"No shit!" Asuka grunted as she threw Unit 02 into a scrambling climb onto the rapidly sinking tower and climbed up onto the protruding axe handle and up to the top of the building.

"真不是闹着玩的！" 明日香嘟囔着，将二号机猛地推向正在迅速下沉的塔楼，攀上突出的斧柄，一路爬至建筑顶端。

"Asuka!" She heard Shinji call out.

"明日香！" 她听到真嗣呼唤。

"Shinji, stay back!" She screamed hoarsely over the com channel. The building she was perched on was nearly lost beneath the shadow. Asuka launched her Eva into a desperate leap onto a slightly higher building thirty metres away and surveyed the scene. Between Unit 02's rapidly sinking perch and the safety of the "shore" of this black sea was about two hundred metres filled with scattered remains of office towers and armament buildings that were slowly subsiding into the shadow.

"真嗣，别过来！" 她通过通讯频道嘶哑地尖叫着。她所栖身的建筑几乎被阴影吞没。明日香操控着她的 Eva 绝望地跃向三十米外稍高的建筑，审视着局势。在二号机迅速下沉的立足点与这片黑色海洋的"岸边"安全地带之间，约两百米的空间里，散布着正在缓缓沉入阴影的办公楼和军火库的残骸。

There was no time to lose.

没有时间可以浪费了。

Leaping from building to building she forced Unit 02 to leapfrog its way closer to safety. Once she missed her footing slightly and just managed to grasp the top of a sinking tower as she reached desperately for a handhold. Once again she felt the numbing cold as her Eva's lower legs slipped into the shadow, but she was just able to use the brute strength of the upper body of the android to haul herself out of it and back onto the building top.

她从一栋建筑跳到另一栋，迫使 02 单位以跳跃的方式更接近安全地带。有一次，她稍微失足，拼命伸手抓住一座下沉塔楼的顶部，勉强抓住了一个支撑点。又一次，她感受到 Eva 下半身滑入阴影时的冰冷，但她凭借这个机器人上半身的蛮力，将自己拉了出来，重新回到了楼顶。

"Two more to go!" She said to herself. Without stopping to think further she jumped her Eva onto the remains of a cell phone tower. The last building between her and the edge of the shadow had only a floor or two left protruding, and those were sinking fast. She jumped the short gap and braced herself for the final lunge. It was going to be a long shot, but she thought that she just might make it.

"还剩两个！" 她自言自语道。没有多想，她操控着她的伊娃跳上了手机信号塔的残骸。她和阴影边缘之间的最后一栋建筑只剩下了一两层楼，而且正在迅速下沉。她跃过那段短距离，为最后的冲刺做好准备。这将是一次长距离的跳跃，但她觉得或许能成功。

"Asuka!" Shinji's cry distracted her for a split second and she focused on the 'shore'. Unit 01 was by the shadow's edge now and had its enormous pistol aimed at the Angel. Before she could reply to him the air was filled with the concussive sound of Shinji emptying the entire magazine into the shadow in a futile attempt to kill it.

"明日香！" 真嗣的呼喊让她分神了一瞬，她将注意力转向了“岸边”。此时，初号机已站在阴影边缘，手持巨型手枪瞄准了使徒。未等她回应，空气中便充斥着真嗣倾泻整匣子弹试图击杀使徒却徒劳无功的震耳欲聋声响。

"Baka!" Asuka yelled. "Get out of the fucking way!"

"笨蛋！" 明日香喊道，"别挡道！"

Instinctively Unit 01 took a step back from the edge just as Asuka's perch was beginning to disappear completely.

本能地，初号机在明日香立足点即将完全消失之际，向后退了一步。

There was no time for thought anymore, Asuka just leapt.

再没有时间思考，明日香只是纵身一跃。

As if in slow motion she could see the edge of the shadow growing closer, every detail perfectly defined as the Evangelion sailed through the air. There were unintelligible voices echoing in her ears over the com link, she could see the vivid purple black and green of Unit 01's arm as it tried to reach out to her Eva. It was all taking an eternity to get there but she was still sure that she was going to make it.

仿佛时间放慢了脚步，她能清晰地看到阴影的边缘逐渐逼近，每一个细节都定义得完美无瑕，而福音战士在空中翱翔。通讯链接中回荡着难以理解的声音，她能看见零号机手臂上那鲜明的紫黑与绿色，正试图伸向她的 Eva。尽管一切似乎都耗费了永恒的时间，但她依然坚信自己能够成功。

Which was why it came as a terrible shock to her the speed at which she suddenly realised that she was going to land about thirty metres short.

正因为如此，当她突然意识到自己将会以三十米的差距着陆时，她感到极度震惊。

"Shinji!" She screamed, without even realising that she had done so, as the numbness of the shadow engulfed the lower half of her body. Instantly she deployed her progressive knife and attempted to slash at the Angel. This was as useless as Shinji's shots had been. She threw the knife away in frustration and tried her best to haul Unit 02 to the edge, but there was no purchase or traction possible in the fabric of the shadow.

"真嗣！" 她尖叫出声，甚至未曾察觉自己已如此呼喊，当阴影的麻木感吞噬了她下半身。她立刻拔出高频刀试图向使徒砍去，然而此举与真嗣的射击一样徒劳。她愤然丢弃刀具，竭尽全力试图将二号机拖至边缘，但在那阴影的织物中，却找不到任何着力点或摩擦力。

"Fuck!" Asuka swore, desperately trying to get her Eva to the edge as more and more of her body became numb to her on this plane.

"该死！" 明日香咒骂着，拼命地试图让她的 Eva 接近边缘，在这个平面上，她身体的麻木感越来越强烈。

"Asuka, grab my hand!" Shinji's voice came over the link. She looked up from her struggles and saw that Unit 01 was attempting to reach out to her from the shore of the black sea. Even then he came up just a little too short.

"明日香，抓住我的手！" 真嗣的声音通过链接传来。她从挣扎中抬头，看见初号机正试图从黑色海岸边向她伸出手。即便如此，他的手还是稍显短了一些。

"No!" Asuka screamed at him. "I said fucking get back!" She tried her best to pull away, the coldness reaching up to her chest now. She realised now that she was going down, nothing could stop it. 'At least' She thought, trying to hold Unit 02's arms out of the shadow, 'I've kept Shinji out of this!' She closed her eyes and even allowed herself a smile. 'You owe me Ayanami!'

"不！"明日香对他尖叫道，"我说了给我滚回去！"她竭尽全力想要挣脱，寒意已蔓延至胸口。她意识到自己正在下沉，一切已无法挽回。'至少'，她想着，努力将二号机的手臂从阴影中伸出，'我让真嗣远离了这一切！'她闭上眼睛，甚至允许自己露出一丝微笑。'你欠我的，绫波！'

Her thoughts were interrupted by a tugging on her right arm.

她的思绪被右臂上的一阵拉扯打断了。

"Shinji, what are you doing?" Misato's voice sounded hoarse in her ears.

"真嗣，你在做什么？" 耳边传来美里沙哑的声音。

Asuka's stomach sank as she opened her eyes. Above the nearly submerged form of her Unit 02 towered the purple behemoth that was Evangelion Unit 01.

明日香的胃一沉，当她睁开眼睛时。在她那几乎被淹没的二号机上方，耸立着紫色的巨兽——初号机。

"Come on Asuka, help me!" Came Shinji's strained voice. Unit 01 had a tight grip on her Eva and was trying to haul it bodily out of the shadow. With horror she saw that the purple unit was already thigh deep in the blackness itself.

"来吧，明日香，帮帮我！"传来真嗣紧张的声音。初号机紧紧抓住她的 Eva，试图将其从阴影中拖出。她惊恐地看到，紫色机体已经深陷黑暗之中，几乎没过半身。

"Idiot!" She yelled at him. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?"

"白痴！" 她冲他吼道，"你他妈的以为自己在干什么？"

"Getting you out of here!" Shinji yelled back at her.

"把你从这里弄出去！" 真嗣对她大声回应道。

"Scheiße!" She swore again to herself as she pulled herself a little higher above the surface. "You're gonna get us both trapped in here, baka!"

"该死！" 她再次暗自咒骂，同时努力让自己在水面上浮得更高一些。"你这个笨蛋，会把我们俩都困在这里的！"

"I can't just let you sink right in front of me!" He said between gasping breaths. "Come on!"

"我不能就这样眼睁睁看着你沉下去！" 他喘着粗气说道，"快点！"

"You always have to be the goddamn hero!" Asuka groaned pulling herself towards the shore. "You really shit me sometimes Ikari!"

"你总是非得当那个该死的英雄！" 明日香一边抱怨，一边拖着身体向岸边挪去。"有时候你真让我受不了，碇！"

"Hold on Asuka!" "坚持住，明日香！"

"I'm fine!" She yelled at him as the shadow reached to below Unit 02's shoulders.

"我没事！"当阴影蔓延至二号机肩下时，她朝他喊道。

Together the two Evangelions struggled closer to the shore, both of them finding it nearly impossible to grapple in the numbing darkness of the black sea. They were somehow managing to use each other to inch painfully closer to the edge of the shadow. Exhaustion was beginning to take its toll on them both though. Despite the help from Unit 01, Asuka was feeling the numbness rising higher and higher as she knew that her Eva was losing its battle with the shadow.

两台福音战士齐心协力，艰难地向岸边靠近，在黑海的麻木黑暗中，双方都发现近身搏斗几乎不可能。他们不知怎地利用彼此，痛苦地一寸寸接近阴影的边缘。然而，疲惫开始对他们产生影响。尽管有零号机的协助，但明日香感到麻木感不断上升，她知道自己的 Eva 正逐渐在与阴影的战斗中败下阵来。

"Asuka!" She vaguely heard Shinji call out, but she could no longer hold the shadow back as it finally reached above her shoulders. She couldn't feel her body at all now, only her right arm, the one that the Unit 01 still held above the surface, remained hers to control, and that could do almost nothing.

"明日香！"她隐约听到真嗣呼唤，但阴影已无法抑制，终于升至她的肩头。此刻，她已感受不到自己的身体，唯有右臂——那只仍被初号机举出水面的手臂——尚存一丝控制，却也几乎无能为力。

"Shinji!" A voice, barely recognisable as the First Child's rang out over the link.

"真嗣！"一个几乎难以辨认是第一适格者发出的声音，在通讯中响起。

"Asuka!" She heard the boy call out again as the numbness travelled up her face. "Asuk… "

"明日香！" 她听到那个男孩再次呼唤，麻木感正沿着她的脸庞蔓延。"明…"

Then the world went white.

随后，世界变得一片雪白。

Strangely now she could feel her body again, the chilling numbness gone from her completely. All around her was white nothingness, no features, nothing. There wasn't even the sense of a space with nothing in it. Or a sense that there was anything beyond the confines of her cockpit. There was just… nothing.

奇怪的是，现在她又能感觉到自己的身体了，那令人寒心的麻木感已完全消失。四周一片白茫茫的虚无，没有任何特征，什么也没有。甚至没有那种空无一物的空间感，也没有任何迹象表明驾驶舱之外还有其他存在。只有……一片虚无。

Nothing except a building pressure on her right arm that seemed to draw her away from the whiteness. She regarded it almost curiously as it got stronger and stronger. The sensation grew and travelled further up her arm until the world suddenly exploded in a conflagration of colour and noise. There was a feeling of travelling through thin air followed by a muted impact at her back.

除了右臂上逐渐增加的压力，似乎要将她从那片白色中拉扯出来，别无他物。她几乎好奇地注视着这股力量越来越强。这种感觉不断蔓延，沿着手臂向上移动，直到世界突然在一片色彩与喧嚣的烈焰中爆炸开来。紧接着，是一种穿越稀薄空气的感觉，随后背部传来一声沉闷的撞击。

Asuka gasped in a huge gulp of LCL and turned her body around to look at the bright blue sky above her and smiled to herself. "You actually managed to do it, baka."

明日香大口吸入 LCL，转身望向头顶那片明亮的蓝天，独自微笑着。“你居然真的做到了，笨蛋。”

"Emergency crews to site." Misato's voice blared in her ears. "Eject the pilot and arrange medivac ASAP! Unit 00 withdraw to original position."

"紧急救援队前往现场。" 碇真嗣的声音在她耳边响起，"立即弹射飞行员并安排紧急医疗撤离！零号机撤回原位。"

"I'm okay…" Asuka tried to say before the plug went dark and the jerking sensation of a forced ejection followed by a rough landing that made her bang her head and forced most of the LCL from her lungs. Rapidly the fluid level in the plug drained away and she spent the next several seconds painfully coughing up the remaining liquid from her respiratory tract.

"我没事…" 明日香刚想开口，插入栓内便陷入黑暗，紧接着是强制弹射的剧烈晃动，以及一次粗暴的着陆，让她头部猛撞，迫使大部分 LCL 从肺中涌出。插入栓内的液体迅速排空，接下来的几秒钟里，她痛苦地咳嗽着，试图将呼吸道中残留的液体排出。

She took several deep breaths of the dank air in the plug before reaching up and releasing the emergency hatch. Feeling completely wrung out she hauled her self up and out of the hatch, spitting out the last of the LCL as she did so.

她在狭窄的空间里深吸了几口潮湿的空气，然后伸手打开了紧急舱门。感到筋疲力尽的她，费力地将自己从舱门中拖出，同时吐出了最后一口 LCL 溶液。

Unit 02 lay sprawled on its front several dozen metres away from her. Looking inelegant but otherwise undamaged. Unit 00 stood between it and the shadow that spread out over most of the western quarter of Tokyo 3. Or what used to be the western quarter. Now it was just a sea of blackness stretching out 680 metres in front of the blue Evangelion that towered above her.

二号机横躺在离她几十米远的前方，看起来不雅观但除此之外并无损伤。零号机则站在它与阴影之间，那片阴影几乎覆盖了第三新东京市西部的绝大部分。或者说，曾经是西部的地方。如今，那里只是一片漆黑的海洋，向着那座高耸于她面前的蓝色福音战士延伸出 680 米。

Unit 01 was nowhere to be seen.

单元 01 无处可寻。

When Misato finally arrived on the surface, the medical teams had already finished patching up the cut on Asuka's forehead. As the redhead sat nursing a cup of bitter instant coffee next to the hastily set up response station, she only had to look at her guardian's face to know that once again she had failed.

当美里最终抵达地面时，医疗小组已经完成了对明日香额头伤口的缝合。红发少女坐在临时搭建的应急站点旁，手捧一杯苦涩的速溶咖啡，只需看一眼她的监护人的脸，便知道自己又一次失败了。

The harsh glare of the halogen lighting gave the surrounding darkness a weight that was almost oppressive. Above it all the zebra striped sphere hung serenely. Seemingly indifferent to the cares of the city beneath it.

卤素灯光的刺眼光芒让周围的黑暗显得格外沉重，几乎令人感到压抑。在这之上，那斑马条纹的球体静静悬挂着，似乎对下方城市的忧虑漠不关心。

"So you're just going to let that blonde bitch blow him up then?"

所以你就打算任由那个金发贱人把他炸了吗？

"I don't need this right now Asuka!" Misato snapped back at her.

"我现在不需要这个，明日香！" 葛城反驳道。

"Come on, I mean, really? Is that the best that the planet's greatest scientific minds, working for an organisation with a budget that could end World Hunger, can come up with? Bomb the shit out of this thing with a bazillion N2 mines and hope that Unit 01 will miraculously pop out of the ground and wave hello at us? Are they stupid?"

得了吧，我是说，真的吗？这就是这个星球上最伟大的科学头脑，为一个预算足以终结世界饥饿的组织所能想出的最佳方案？用无数 N2 地雷狂轰滥炸这玩意儿，然后指望零号机奇迹般地从地里冒出来向我们挥手问好？他们是不是傻？

"According to Ritsuko, the Magi have calculated that this course of action has the highest chance of success. So at 0630 you and Rei will use your A-T Fields to focus the blast and protect the city, and the UN air fleet will drop its entire stock of N2 mines onto the Angel." She paused for effect. "You got a better plan Asuka? 'Cos I'm all ears if you do!" Misato sounded desperate to believe that there was some hope of Shinji emerging alive from wherever this Angel had him. Asuka felt for her guardian, but also felt a burning anger at what she knew to be a rescue mission for Unit 01 only. The life of Shinji was a secondary consideration to Ritsuko and the Commander and both she and Misato knew it.

根据律子的说法，MAGI 计算出这一行动方案成功几率最高。因此，在 0630 时，你和绫波将利用你们的 A-T 力场聚焦爆炸并保护城市，同时联合国空军舰队将倾其所有 N2 地雷投向使徒。她故意停顿了一下，“你有更好的计划吗，明日香？如果有的话，我洗耳恭听！”美里迫切地希望相信还有一丝希望，能让真嗣从使徒所在之处生还。明日香同情她的监护人，但同时也对这场仅针对零号机的救援任务感到愤怒。真嗣的生死对律子和指挥官来说只是次要考虑，她和美里都心知肚明。

"It still sucks, don't try and tell me it doesn't Misato!"

它还是糟透了，别试图告诉我它不糟，美里！

"I really don't have time for this!" The Major replied tiredly. "Be ready to sortie at 0600. Don't worry… Shinji will find a way back… he always does."

"我真没时间管这个！"少校疲惫地回答，"准备好在 0600 出击。别担心……真嗣会找到回来的方法的……他总是这样。"

She was left alone again as Misato strode off to deal with the preparations for the drop. Asuka ran her hands through her long red hair and sighed loudly. "I hope that you're right, Misato." She whispered to herself. Even though she knew what should happen next a large knot of tension still roiled inside her stomach. What if things went differently this time? The battle itself had gone differently, even though the result had been much the same. What if that minor change meant that Unit 01 didn't go berserk and rip its way out a mere fifteen seconds before the N2 mines were dropped? What if by attempting to protect Shinji from this Angel she had condemned him to death inside the nothingness of the Dirac sea?

她再次被独自留下，因为美里大步离开去处理投放的准备工作。明日香用手梳理着她那长长的红发，大声叹了口气。“希望你是对的，美里。”她自言自语地低声说道。尽管她知道接下来会发生什么，但胃里仍有一团紧张的结在翻滚。如果这次情况不同怎么办？战斗本身已经有所不同，尽管结果大致相同。如果那微小的变化意味着零号机不会在 N2 地雷投放前仅十五秒时发狂并撕裂出路怎么办？如果她试图保护真嗣免受这个使徒的伤害，却让他陷入了狄拉克海的无尽虚空之中，那该怎么办？

She looked at the timer on the wrist panel of her suit. Two hours until they were due to sortie. Two hours and twenty-three minutes until the projected failure of Unit 01's life support systems. Two hours and thirty minutes until the UN Air Fleet was due to obliterate the 12th Angel with a massive strike of N2 mines.

她看了看自己战斗服手腕面板上的计时器。距离出击还有两小时。距离零号机生命维持系统预计故障还有两小时二十三分钟。距离联合国空军舰队预计用大量 N2 地雷对第十二使徒进行毁灭性打击还有两小时三十分钟。

"Arrrgh!" Asuka growled. "This is driving me fucking crazy!"

啊！" 明日香咆哮道，"这简直要把我逼疯了！

Stomping moodily between the arcs of light from the lighting gantries she headed for the white catering van with the self serve powdered coffee machine and pre-wrapped sandwiches that seemed to lurk in the background of every NERV external operation.

她闷闷不乐地在灯光架投下的光弧间踱步，朝着那辆白色餐饮车走去，车上有一台自助式速溶咖啡机和预先包装好的三明治，似乎每次 NERV 的外部行动中，它都隐匿在背景之中。

Twisting the dials to concoct the unspeakable horror in a paper cup that these contraptions always brewed in the place of coffee, Asuka continued to agonise and replay the previous battle in her head. Last time around Unit 01 has torn its way out of the Angel just as the UN bombers had appeared overhead. That didn't give her a big window of opportunity if it failed to appear in the same way this time around.

阿苏卡继续在脑海中痛苦地重播着之前的战斗，同时扭动着旋钮，用这些装置总是在纸杯中调制出的那种难以言喻的恐怖来代替咖啡。上次，零号机在联合国轰炸机出现在头顶时，撕裂了天使的身体逃了出来。如果这次它没有以同样的方式出现，那留给她的机会窗口就不会太大。

"Stupid fucking Shinji…" She muttered as she leaned on a nearby railing that overlooked the black sea that had so recently swallowed the Third Child. "Always has to be the big fucking hero… Baka's got some kind of freaking Messiah Complex or something."

愚蠢透顶的真嗣……"她低声咒骂着，倚靠在附近的栏杆上，俯瞰着刚刚吞噬了第三适格者的黑色海洋。"总是要逞英雄……这家伙是不是有什么救世主情结之类的。

She took a swig of the bitter instant coffee and grimaced at the flavour. "Stupid Shinji…" She repeated.

她喝了一口苦涩的速溶咖啡，对那味道皱起了眉头。“愚蠢的真嗣……”她重复道。

"He fell attempting to rescue you, Pilot Soryu." A voice interrupted her sour musings. "I fail to see how that is an act of stupidity."

“他在试图救你时摔倒了，Soryu 飞行员。”一个声音打断了她不悦的思绪。“我看不出这怎么是愚蠢的行为。”

The redhead did not even turn her gaze away from the shadow to answer. "Like you said, Wondergirl, he fell 'attempting' to rescue me. Did he succeed?"

红发女子甚至没有从阴影处移开目光就回答道：“就像你说的，神奇女孩，他是在‘试图’救我时掉下去的。他成功了吗？”

"No, he did not. Though he did manage to keep Unit 02 out of the shadow until Unit 00 was able to pull it free."

不，他没有。尽管他确实设法让二号机保持在了阴影之外，直到零号机能够将其拉出。

"Exactly!" Asuka sneered in reply. "I had everything under control until he showed up, disobeying orders to try and be the uber-boy hero and save the poor helpless little girl. Now he's stuck again in that fucking shadow and to make it even more galling I had to get saved by you!"

"没错！"明日香冷笑着回答，"本来一切尽在掌握，直到他出现，违抗命令试图扮演超级英雄，去救那个可怜无助的小女孩。现在他又被困在那该死的阴影里，更让人恼火的是，我还得靠你来救！"

"I do not understand." 我不明白。

Asuka just turned her head slightly to look at the other girl. "You wouldn't, Wondergirl." She said with a sigh, resting her chin on her hands as she leant heavily on the railing. "Neither of you have a tactical bone in your thin pasty bodies! He only blunders on in and tries to bash his way through and you… All you seem to be good for is noble but essentially futile suicide missions! Both of you gladly would die just to be noticed by the Commander!" Asuka's voice grew harsher as she went on. "You both would try and kill yourselves just to get his attention! Well tell me, honour student, what fucking good has it done either of you? What use is empty praise when you're dead?"

明日香只是微微侧头看向另一个女孩，叹了口气说：“你不会的，奇迹女孩。”她将下巴搁在手上，身体沉重地倚在栏杆上。“你们俩那瘦弱苍白的身体里，哪有什么战术细胞！他只会莽撞地冲进去，试图用蛮力解决问题，而你……你似乎只擅长那些崇高却本质上无望的自杀任务！你们俩都乐意为了得到指挥官的注意而赴死！”明日香的声音随着话语越发严厉，“你们俩都会试图自杀以吸引他的注意！那么告诉我，荣誉学生，这对你们俩有什么好处？当你死了，那些空洞的赞美又有什么用？”

The blue haired girl was silent for several moments. Eventually she spoke "It is all that I have." She answered in an almost plaintive voice.

蓝发女孩沉默了片刻，最终她开口道：“这是我所拥有的一切。”她的声音几乎带着哀怨。

Asuka turned around fully and faced the other girl. Rei just stared at her, a look of mild confusion the only emotion showing on her face.

明日香完全转过身来，面对着另一个女孩。绫波只是盯着她，脸上唯一显露出的情绪是轻微的困惑。

"Pathetic." Asuka said wearily. "I swear that I'm to only sane person in this whole fucking universe!"

可悲。" 明日香疲惫地说道，"我发誓，我是这个该死的宇宙中唯一理智的人！

"Then why is it that you pilot Unit 02?" Rei asked her suddenly. "Do you not also pilot for the praise of others?"

那为什么你还要驾驶二号机呢？" 绫波突然问她，"难道你不也是为了他人的赞誉而驾驶吗？

Asuka laughed bitterly at the First Child's question.

明日香苦笑着回应了第一适格者的问题。

"I do not understand how you find humour in my question." Rei said.

"我不明白你怎么会在我的问题中找到幽默。" 丽说。

"At the risk of repeating myself, you wouldn't First, you really wouldn't!" The German girl replied shaking her head. "Let's just call it déjà vu!"

“冒着重复自己的风险，你不会的，真的，你绝对不会！”德国女孩摇头回答道，“我们就称之为似曾相识吧！”

Still Rei looked at Asuka quizzically.

尽管如此，绫还是疑惑地看着明日香。

"Fine, Wondergirl! I will admit that once upon a time I did pilot my Eva because it made me feel special, I received praise and it made me feel as though I was worth something. I was the best at what I did and people treated me with respect because of that. Now, frankly, I could give a rat's ass what most of them thought!" Asuka said, gesturing widely with her right arm as if encompassing the whole of Tokyo-3. "Now I Pilot because it's the only chance I've got to set things right. You wouldn't understand Ayanami, but between you, me and blunder boy we've got to fix up this clusterfuck world or the whole of Humanity is down the toilet!"

好吧，奇迹女孩！我承认，曾经有一段时间，我驾驶我的 Eva 是因为它让我感觉自己很特别，我得到了赞扬，让我觉得自己有价值。我是我所做事情中最出色的，人们因此对我表示尊重。现在，坦白说，我根本不在乎他们大多数人的想法！" 明日香说着，用她的右臂大幅度地比划着，仿佛要把整个第三新东京市都囊括进去。"现在我驾驶 Eva，是因为这是我唯一能纠正一切的机会。你不会理解的，绫波，但我和你，还有那个笨蛋，我们必须修复这个混乱的世界，否则整个人类都将完蛋！"

"You are referring to the Angels?"

您指的是天使吗？

"Oh boy, you are so dense sometimes First!" She decided to change tack and grabbed Rei's arm, bringing her to the railing. "What do you see out there?

"哎呀，你有时候真是迟钝得可以，第一！" 她决定改变策略，抓住了零的手臂，将她带到栏杆旁。"你在外面看到了什么？"

"The Angel." 《天使》

"Good girl!" Asuka said sarcastically. "And what's so special about this Angel?"

"好女孩！" 明日香讽刺地说道，"这个使徒有什么特别的？"

The other girl frowned. "Pilot Ikari is trapped within it."

另一个女孩皱起了眉头。“碇真嗣驾驶员被困在里面了。”

"Call him Shinji, like you did in the battle. The way you call him 'Pilot Ikari' all the time makes him sound like some kind of appliance or something!"

叫他真嗣吧，就像你在战斗中那样。你总是称呼他为“碇真嗣驾驶员”，让他听起来像某种器具似的！

The blue haired girl hesitated for a few more moments. "Shinji is trapped within the Angel." She said finally.

蓝发女孩又犹豫了一会儿。“真嗣被困在使徒里了。”她最终说道。

"How does that make you feel?" The German girl probed.

"这让你感觉如何？" 德国女孩探询道。

"I feel an emptiness within myself at the thought of Shinji inside that shadow. My stomach aches in an unfamiliar way when I consider his wellbeing."

一想到真嗣在那阴影之中，我内心便感到一种空虚。当我考虑他的安危时，我的胃部会以一种不熟悉的方式隐隐作痛。

Asuka looked more closely at Rei. Up till that point she had considered the First Child as little more than one of the Commander's pawns in the lead up to Third Impact. Thereafter to become the more ethereal pain in the ass that was responsible for her being where she was right at that moment. Now she weighed up the fairness of her opinion.

明日香更仔细地打量着绫波。直到那一刻，她一直认为第一适格者不过是指挥官在第三次冲击前的一系列行动中的棋子。之后，又变成了那个让她此刻处境尴尬的、飘渺难捉的麻烦制造者。现在，她开始权衡自己看法的公正性。

"So you're worried for him?"

所以你是在为他担心吗？

Rei frowned for a moment, as if pondering a troubling concept. "Yes." She answered simply.

丽皱眉片刻，仿佛在思索一个令人困扰的概念。“是的。”她简单地回答道。

Asuka drained the last of her coffee and threw the paper cup over the rail. "So… how do you feel about Shinji?"

明日香喝完了最后一口咖啡，将纸杯扔过栏杆。“那么……你对真嗣有什么感觉？”

"He is an effective pilot."

他是一位高效的飞行员。

"What the fuck kind of answer is that?" The redhead growled, burying her face in her hands in exasperation.

"这他妈算什么回答？" 红发女子恼怒地嘟囔着，双手捂脸，显得十分沮丧。

Rei just stared at her without answering.

零只是盯着她，没有回答。

"I'm going to ask again, using simple words." Asuka said slowly and with what she felt was extreme restraint. "How does Shinji make you feel?"

“我再问一次，用简单的词。” 明日香缓缓地说，她觉得自己已经极力克制了。“真嗣让你感觉如何？”

To her surprise a faint, almost indiscernible blush crept over the First Child's cheeks. "When I consider Shinji's wellbeing, I feel warm… inside." She answered softly.

令她惊讶的是，一丝几乎难以察觉的红晕悄悄爬上了第一少女的脸颊。“当我考虑到真嗣的安危时，我内心感到温暖。”她轻声回答。

"Hallelujah!" Asuka exclaimed, clapping her hands. "Finally a straight answer!"

“哈利路亚！”明日香欢呼着拍手，“终于得到一个直接的答案了！”

"I do not see what..."

我看不到什么...

"Let me explain this to you, Wondergirl." Asuka interrupted. "Thinking about Shinji makes you feel all warm and fluffy inside, yes? And now that he's in danger you're worried about him and want him to come back unharmed, right?"

"让我给你解释一下，神奇女孩。" 明日香打断道，"想到真嗣，你心里就暖洋洋、软绵绵的，对吧？现在他遇到危险了，你担心他，希望他平安归来，对吗？"

"That is correct." 没错。

"'That is correct.'" Asuka mimicked. "Why not just say yes? Try and speak like a normal person, not some fucking robot!"

"没错。"明日香模仿道，"直接说'是'不就好了？试着像正常人一样说话，别像个该死的机器人！"

"Yes." Rei answered. "是的。" 绫回答道。

"So in other words, you care for him!"

换言之，你很在乎他！

Rei Ayanami dropped her gaze to the darkened streetscape on the shadow's edge. "Do I care for him? Is that what I feel?"

绫波丽将目光投向阴影边缘昏暗的街道景象，自问道：“我在乎他吗？这就是我所感受到的吗？”

"Are you dense? Of course you do!" Asuka replied. "When you feel like that about another person, it's called caring. Some people even call it 'love.'"

"你是不是傻？当然有啦！" 明日香回答道，"当你对另一个人有那种感觉时，就叫做关心。有些人甚至称之为'爱'。"

The First Child returned her gaze to Asuka's questioningly, but said nothing.

第一个孩子将目光转回明日香，带着疑问，但什么也没说。

"Though, of course," Asuka continued. "I wouldn't take that information too far if I were you! If you two ever had children they would all probably have no teeth and remarkable skills with the banjo!"

当然，”明日香继续说道，“如果我是你，我不会把这信息当真！如果你们俩将来有了孩子，他们可能都会没有牙齿，但却有着惊人的班卓琴技艺！”

"I… I cannot have children." Rei answered with puzzlement.

"我…我不能有孩子。" 绫回答时带着困惑。

"Sheesh! I was just joking Wondergirl!"

哎呀！我只是开玩笑的，神奇女孩！

"I did not realise." 我没有意识到。

Asuka sighed, stepped back from the rail and stretched her arms up above her. "So, why are you here, Wondergirl? As much as I enjoy these 'Real Girl' moments, I'm not sure if I want to be the singing cricket to your Pinocchio right now."

明日香叹了口气，从栏杆边退后一步，双臂向上伸展。“那么，你来这里做什么，神奇女孩？虽然我很享受这些‘真实女孩’的时刻，但我不确定现在是否想成为你皮诺曹身边的歌唱蟋蟀。”

The blue haired girl's brows moved downward slightly in confusion at Asuka's words. "I have recently felt a strong compulsion to speak with you, Pilot Soryu."

蓝发女孩听到明日香的话后，眉头微微皱起，显得有些困惑。"我最近强烈地感觉到有必要和你谈谈，惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员。"

"You, want to talk with me?"

你想和我谈谈吗？

"Yes." 是的。

"Okay…" Asuka replied uncertainly. "A strong compulsion to speak to me, you say? What about exactly, Wondergirl? Please don't let it be the talk about where babies come from or ask me to show you the meaning of love, 'cos I'm not going there!"

"好吧……"明日香不确定地回答道，"你说有一种强烈的冲动想和我说话？具体是什么，奇迹少女？拜托千万别是关于宝宝从哪里来的话题，或者让我教你什么是爱，因为我可不想涉及那些！"

"No, those are not topics that I wish to discuss with you." Rei answered. "Of greater interest to me is why you are different."

不，那些不是我想和你讨论的话题。" 丽回答道，"我更感兴趣的是你为什么与众不同。

"Me? Different?" "我？与众不同？"

"Yes. Since the day of your outburst in the classroom, your behaviour has altered significantly. Initially I was disinterested in the reason for this change, but recently I have felt compelled to seek you out to find out why."

是的。自从你在教室里爆发的那天起，你的行为就发生了显著变化。起初我对这种改变的原因并不感兴趣，但最近我感到不得不找你，想要弄清楚为什么。

"It's not something you would understand, Wondergirl."

这不是你能理解的事情，神奇女孩。

"Would Mr Kaji Understand?"

卡吉先生能理解吗？

"Huh?" Asuka asked in confusion. "What the hell does that mean?"

"嗯？" 明日香困惑地问道，"这到底是什么意思？"

"The other day when you spoke to Mr Kaji at the Café near the market, he appeared to be surprised at what you had said to him. Did you confide in him the reason for your changed behaviour?"

那天你在市场附近的咖啡馆和 Kaji 先生谈话时，他似乎对你说的话感到惊讶。你有没有向他透露你行为改变的原因？

"What the fuck… !" Asuka exclaimed. "How did you know about that?"

"搞什么鬼… !" 明日香惊呼道。"你怎么会知道那件事？"

"I observed you speaking with him that day. I had been attempting to seek you out to converse with you, but he appeared so I concealed myself from your presence." Rei replied. "I do not trust Mr Kaji."

那天我看到你和他交谈了。我本想找你聊聊，但他出现了，我就躲开了。" 绫回答道，"我不信任卡吉先生。"

"So how long have you been spying on me?"

你监视我多久了？

"I have not been spying on you, Pilot Soryu. I merely sought you out on that occasion due to my strong desire to converse with you."

我并没有在监视你，Soryu 飞行员。那次我之所以找你，只是因为我非常渴望与你交谈。

"Fine, whatever." A small note of fear sounded in hear head. "So I suppose now the Commander knows all about this as well? I mean you'd never even cut your toenails without telling Commander Ikari all about it!"

"好吧，随便。" 一丝恐惧在她的脑海中响起。"那么我想现在指挥官也知道这一切了？我的意思是，你甚至不会在没告诉碇司令的情况下剪你的脚趾甲！"

"I have not mentioned this to the Commander." Rei answered with apparent confusion. "I do not wish him to know about my interest in your behaviour. He would tell me to cease as it has no relevance to my piloting ability."

我还没有向指挥官提及此事。" 绫波丽带着明显的困惑回答道，"我不希望他知道我对你的行为感兴趣。他会告诉我停止，因为这与我的驾驶能力无关。

Asuka closed her eyes for a second and sighed. "Why me? Don't I have enough problems without babysitting you as well? It's all your fault that I'm stuck here anyway!"

明日香闭上眼睛片刻，叹了口气。“为什么是我？难道我自己的麻烦还不够多，还得照顾你？反正我被困在这里都是你的错！”

"I am not sure of what you mean."

我不太明白你的意思。

"Let's keep it that way for the time being, eh Wondergirl?" Asuka said pushing herself away from the railing. "At the risk of turning my innards to sludge, I need another coffee! Talking with you for more than three minutes is enough to wear anyone out!"

"暂时就保持这样吧，嗯，神奇女孩？" 明日香说着，从栏杆边退开。"冒着内脏变成泥浆的风险，我得再来杯咖啡！跟你聊超过三分钟，足以让任何人筋疲力尽！"

Rei watched as the Second Child walked tiredly away from her and back to the nearby van. The voice inside her that she had felt had been goading her into seeking out the other girl was strangely silent for the time being. She knew that following Pilot Soryu any further this night would only be likely to provoke her.

绫看着第二适格者疲惫地从她身边走开，回到附近的货车。她内心那个一直怂恿她去寻找另一个女孩的声音此刻却出奇地沉默了。她知道，今晚再继续跟踪飞行员惣流，只会激怒她。

Feeling strangely satisfied with how their talk had gone, Rei walked away from the rail overlooking the Shadow and went to wait by her Evangelion until the time to sortie arrived.

感受到一种莫名的满足，因为他们的谈话进展顺利，Rei 离开了俯瞰影子的栏杆，走到她的福音战士旁等待出击时刻的到来。

The city was again silent and still, as if holding its breath for what the dawn would bring.

城市再次陷入寂静与静止，仿佛屏息以待黎明将带来什么。

"N2 drop inbound." "N2 下降中。"

"Roger." Misato stood in the makeshift command post watching the Evangelions move into their pre-arranged positions near the Shadow. She had insisted on staying down there with some of the lowlier techs even when most of the main NERV personnel involved had returned to the relative safety of the Command Bridge. She wanted to be as close to the action as she could. She wanted to be there if Unit 01 was retrieved. She wanted to be the first person Shinji saw when they opened the plug door.

"收到。" 美里站在临时指挥所内，注视着使徒们移动到预先安排的靠近影子的位置。尽管大多数参与的主要 NERV 人员已返回相对安全的指挥桥，她坚持留在下面，与一些低级技术人员一起。她希望尽可能接近行动现场。如果零号机被回收，她希望在场。她希望成为打开插入栓门时，真嗣看到的第一个人。

She knew that Asuka often complained loudly that she mollycoddled the boy. Perhaps the girl was right? Though the Major actually thought that Asuka was more than likely jealous of Misato's attention to the Third Child. 'She got it bad for him, that's for sure' She thought with a wry smile. 'Poor kid. He's got no idea what that girl would do if she got her hooks into him.' She sipped at her coffee and felt just a little envious of the redheaded girl who was still in the carefree days of youth. 'Just wait 'til you grow up Asuka. You'll see how truly cruel the world can be!'

她知道明日香经常大声抱怨她溺爱那个男孩。或许那女孩说得对？尽管少校实际上认为明日香很可能是嫉妒美里对第三适格者的关注。'她对他可是情有独钟，这是肯定的'，她苦笑着想。'可怜的孩子。他根本不知道如果那女孩得手了，她会对他做什么。'她啜饮着咖啡，对那个红发女孩仍处于无忧无虑的青春时光感到一丝嫉妒。'等你长大吧，明日香。你会见识到这个世界有多么残酷！'

Her smile faded as she considered that perhaps none of these kids actually ever had the chance to have the childhoods that they deserved. 'Once we defeat the Angels, then things will be better… things will be normal...'

她的笑容逐渐消失，因为她想到，或许这些孩子从未真正有机会拥有他们应得的童年。'一旦我们战胜了天使，一切都会好起来的……一切都会恢复正常……'

"T-minus Thirty seconds until N2 drop."

"倒计时三十秒，准备投放 N2。"

"Roger." She repeated. She flicked open the communications channel to the two Evangelions. "N2 mines inbound, deploy AT-Fields at maximum."

"收到。" 她重复道。随即打开与两台福音战士的通讯频道："N2 地雷即将到达，全力展开 AT 力场。"

She watched the distortion in the air as Units 00 and 02 spread their AT-Fields out so as to protect the city and focus the energy released from the N2 mines directly into the heart of the Shadow.

她注视着空气中的扭曲，随着 00 和 02 号单位展开它们的 AT 力场，以保护城市并将 N2 地雷释放的能量直接聚焦到影子的核心。

"Come on, come on, come on Shinji..."

来吧，来吧，来吧，真嗣……

If not for the tension of the situation Misato would have smiled. She knew that Asuka would not even realise that she was speaking those words over an open com channel for the whole of the command centre to hear.

如果不是因为紧张的局势，葛城美里本会微笑。她知道明日香甚至没有意识到自己正在通过开放的通讯频道，让整个指挥中心都能听到她的话。

"T-minus Twenty seconds until drop."

倒计时二十秒，即将投放。

"Come on Shinji, come on Shinji, come on Shinji…" Asuka's mantra had a desperate edge to it now.

"来吧，真嗣，来吧，真嗣，来吧，真嗣……" 明日香的咒语此刻带着绝望的锋芒。

Despite the coolness of the early morning, Misato could feel the sweat pooling in the small of her back.

尽管清晨的凉意袭人，但 Misato 仍能感觉到汗水在后腰处汇聚。

"T-minus fifteen seconds."

倒计时十五秒。

Somewhere amongst the incredible tension, Misato realised that Asuka had suddenly stopped speaking.

在紧张得令人难以置信的氛围中，葛城美里意识到明日香突然停止了说话。

"T-minus ten seconds." 倒计时十秒。

"Unit 02 has lowered its AT-Field!"

"二号机降低了它的 AT 力场！"

"What the fuck?" Misato cursed in disbelief. "Abort N2 Drop! Abort!"

"搞什么鬼？" 葛城美里难以置信地咒骂道。"取消 N2 投放！取消！"

A brief crackle of static. "N2 Drop aborted." Came the confirmation.

一阵短暂的静电噪音。"N2 投放已中止。"确认信息传来。

Misato was seething "Asuka, what the hell do you think…."

美里怒气冲冲地说：“明日香，你到底在想什么……”

A yell from Lt Aoba over the link to Central Dogma interrupted her rant. "Massive energy reading from inside the target!"

来自青叶中尉通过链接至中央教条的喊声打断了她的长篇大论：“目标内部检测到巨大能量读数！”

Misato's eyes swung to the monitor in front of her as the sphere floating above the city turned suddenly black and begin to writhe and shudder. Rapidly small fissures began to appear all over it surface.

当悬浮在城市上空的球体突然变黑并开始扭曲颤抖时，Misato 的目光转向了她面前的监视器。很快，它的表面开始出现许多细小的裂缝。

"Asuka, Rei. Standby, we don't know what…" Once again she was interrupted.

“明日香，绫波，待命，我们还不清楚会发生什么……”她的话再次被打断了。

"He's done it!" Asuka suddenly yelled. Misato thought briefly that the girl sounded almost triumphant.

"他做到了！" 明日香突然喊道。美里短暂地想到，这女孩的声音几乎带着胜利的喜悦。

As Unit 02's pilot said those words, Misato could see the fissures widen on the sphere and thick dark blood begin pouring out of them, spattering the shadow below. She zoomed the view in on one of the larger splits in the fabric of the Angel and was astonished as two enormous grue covered hands emerged through it.

当二号机的驾驶员说出这些话时，葛城美里看到球体上的裂缝扩大，浓稠的暗红色血液开始从裂缝中涌出，溅落在下方的阴影上。她将视野聚焦在使徒表面的一道较大裂口上，惊讶地看到两只巨大的、覆盖着粘液的手从中伸出。

"Is that…" "那是……"

The bloody hands grasped and ripped the rent wide open revealing finally the terrifying sight of Unit 01 tearing its way out of the Angel. As its head trust through the opening it had made the Evangelion let out a shattering roar that shook the makeshift command post that Misato was in, causing equipment to rattle and fall of the shelves around her.

血淋淋的双手紧抓着，将裂口撕扯得更加宽阔，最终揭露出零号机从天使体内破体而出的恐怖景象。当其头部穿过自己制造的开口时，这台福音战士发出了一声震耳欲聋的咆哮，震撼了临时指挥所，使得设备在美里周围摇晃并从架子上跌落。

"Oh my God, what is that thing?" She gasped in horror.

"哦，天哪，那是什么东西？" 她惊恐地喘息着。

More gore began to fall of the disintegrating Angel as the whole of NERV watching in disbelief as Unit 01 tore it to shreds. Finally the Evangelion completely destroyed the sphere and landed still roaring onto the surface of the shadow as bloody carnage rained around it. The blackness split asunder at the impact. The Eva then finally stood still, seemingly staring straight at Misato as she stood shell-shocked in the temporary Command Post.

随着整个 NERV 组织难以置信地目睹这一切，更多的血肉从崩解的天使身上落下，而零号机将其撕成碎片。最终，这台福音战士彻底摧毁了球体，咆哮着降落在阴影的表面，四周血雨腥风。撞击之下，黑暗裂开了。随后，零号机终于静止不动，仿佛直勾勾地盯着临时指挥所里震惊得目瞪口呆的葛城美里。

"The target has gone completely silent." The over-awed voice of Lt Aoba sounded over the com link from Central Dogma.

"目标已完全沉默。" 来自中央教条的通讯链接中，青叶中尉敬畏的声音响起。

"R-Roger." Misato answered. "Transmit eject code for Unit 01 and despatch medical and recovery crews immediately."

"R-罗杰。" 碇真嗣回答道，"立即传输 01 号机体的弹射代码，并派遣医疗和回收小组。"

"Roger." 收到。

Grabbing her jacket Misato exited the Command Post and walked wearily in the pale light of dawn to the waiting V-TOL that would fly her to where Unit 01 now crouched amongst the debris of the defeated Angel.

抓起外套，美里离开了指挥所，在黎明的苍白光线中疲惫地走向等待的垂直起降飞机，它将载她前往零号机此刻蹲伏在已被击败的天使残骸中的地方。

Her Shinji was back.

她的真嗣回来了。

Asuka tossed and turned again on her bed, causing the sheets to tangle and wrap around her body like a shroud. In frustration she threw the bedclothes off her and sat up. The glowing green numbers on her bedside clock showed 12:17am. She groaned and flopped back down onto the mattress. She still was unable to sleep most nights. Even though the battle and its aftermath had left her feeling completely drained and exhausted, sleep was still difficult at best for the German girl since she had returned to the pre-Impact world.

明日香在床上辗转反侧，床单如同裹尸布般缠绕着她的身体。她懊恼地掀开被褥，坐起身来。床头时钟上那泛着绿光的数字显示着凌晨 12 点 17 分。她呻吟一声，又重重地倒回床垫上。大多数夜晚，她依旧难以入眠。尽管战斗及其余波让她感到彻底的疲惫和耗尽，但自从回到冲击前的世界后，这位德国女孩想要安然入睡，依旧困难重重。

Although she felt a massive weight of relief at the fact that Shinji had still managed to escape from the 12th Angel. 'No thanks to me!' She thought wryly. The day had been a frustrating one. She had wanted to go to see him in the Infirmary, but her guardian, of course, had other ideas.

尽管她因真嗣仍能从第十二使徒手中逃脱而感到巨大的解脱，但她苦涩地想：“这可不关我的事！”那天真是令人沮丧。她本想去医务室看望他，但她的监护人当然有别的打算。

A two and a half hour chewing out from Misato had awaited Asuka in the briefing room when she had returned to base. The Major had wanted to know why Asuka had lowered her AT-Field just as the UN was about to drop their N2 Mines, and didn't seem to take "It was just a feeling I had." As an valid excuse. A heated argument had followed. Then an awkward silence. Followed by the Major giving the startled Second Child an unexpected hug and sobbing "He's back!" Over and over onto the girl's shoulder. Then debriefing, medical examinations and psychograph testing had taken Asuka well into the later hours of the evening.

当明日香返回基地时，她在简报室里等待着的是美里长达两个半小时的严厉训斥。美里少校想知道为什么在联合国即将投下 N2 地雷的那一刻，明日香会降低她的 AT 力场，并且似乎并不接受“那只是我的一种感觉”作为合理的解释。随后是一场激烈的争论，接着是尴尬的沉默。然后，美里少校突然给了惊愕的第二适格者一个意外的拥抱，在女孩的肩上反复抽泣着“他回来了！”之后，明日香接受了情况汇报、医疗检查和心理图谱测试，一直持续到深夜。

She was annoyed because she had wanted to go and see Shinji in the Infirmary. 'I didn't even get to hear Wondergirl say her line this time.' She mused bitterly. By the time she had returned to the apartment Shinji had been discharged from the Infirmary and had gone to bed. Feeling disconsolate and alone Asuka ate a small supper and turned in herself.

她感到恼火，因为她本想去医务室看望真嗣。'这次我连听 Wondergirl 说台词的机会都没有。'她苦涩地沉思着。等她回到公寓时，真嗣已经出院并上床睡觉了。感到沮丧和孤独的明日香简单吃了点晚饭，也去睡觉了。

Now here she was. She hadn't seen a bed for nearly 48 hours. Surely if she was ever going to get some sleep in this time frame it should be now! Instead she still found it almost impossible to get any decent slumber. The turmoil in her mind and stomach would give her no rest.

此刻她就在这里。她已经将近 48 小时没见过床了。如果在这段时间里她真能睡上一觉，那现在应该是时候了！然而，她仍然觉得几乎不可能获得一段像样的睡眠。她内心的纷扰和胃部的翻腾让她无法得到片刻安宁。

"This is fucking ridiculous!" She muttered as she sat on the side of the bed. The pale moonlight streamed in through her bedroom window, giving everything a muted blue tinge.

"这太荒谬了！" 她坐在床边喃喃自语。苍白的月光透过卧室窗户洒进来，给一切蒙上了淡淡的蓝色调。

'Shinji is okay' She told herself. Still she hadn't actually seen him since before the battle. Maybe that was what the problem was. With a new purpose she stood up and walked to her bedroom door. Gingerly she slid it open, making as little noise as possible. The apartment was quiet. Only the hum of Pen-Pen's custom refrigerator was audible to her in the stillness of the night air.

“真嗣应该没事的。”她自言自语道。尽管自从战斗前她就再也没见过他。或许这就是问题所在。带着新的决心，她站起身，走向卧室门。小心翼翼地，她尽可能不出声地推开门。公寓里静悄悄的，只有企鹅 PEN-PEN 的定制冰箱在静夜中发出微弱的嗡鸣声。

Carefully she crept along the hallway.

她小心翼翼地沿着走廊悄悄前行。

Shinji's Lovely Suite 真嗣的可爱套房

The katakana almost seemed to mock her as she stood poised at his door. What felt like hours passed as Asuka stood, her heart pounding and her mouth dry. Finally she put her hand to the door.

当她站在他的门前，摆出准备姿态时，片假名几乎像是在嘲笑她。时间仿佛过去了好几个小时，明日香站在那里，心跳如鼓，口干舌燥。最终，她将手放在了门上。

"Ikuhayo, Asuka." She whispered to herself as she slid the door gently open.

"走吧，明日香。" 她轻声自语，同时轻轻推开了门。

The first thing that she noticed was that Shinji's room was a lot darker than hers. It took several seconds before she made out the shape of him under the bedclothes. 'Just gotta make sure.' She thought to herself as she padded softly across the room to where his bed lay. The steady rhythm of his breathing comforted her. She realised that she hadn't heard it like this for a long time.

她首先注意到的是，真嗣的房间比她的暗得多。过了好几秒，她才在床单下辨认出他的轮廓。'只是确认一下。' 她心里想着，轻手轻脚地穿过房间，走向他的床边。他平稳的呼吸节奏让她感到安心。她意识到，自己已经很久没有这样听过他的呼吸了。

"I'm glad that you can sleep, baka…"

"我很高兴你能睡着，笨蛋……"

Delicately she brushed his hair away from his forehead with her hand. "I'm glad that you made it out okay… I missed you Shinji…" She said softly. She could feel her eyes beginning to prickle with tears. 'This is getting sappy now!' She thought. 'The Great Asuka Langley Soryu, blubbering like a silly schoolgirl!'

她轻柔地用手将他的头发从额前拨开，柔声说道：“我很高兴你平安出来了……我好想你，真嗣……”她能感觉到自己的眼睛开始刺痛，泪水即将涌出。“现在变得这么感伤了！”她心想，“伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索西，竟然像个傻乎乎的女学生一样哭哭啼啼！”

"Sweet dreams, Shinji-kun." She sniffed before turning and starting to walk out of the room.

"做个好梦，真嗣君。" 她吸了吸鼻子，然后转身开始走出房间。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She froze. 她愣住了。

"Asuka, is that you?" Shinji's voice came blearily from behind her.

"明日香，是你吗？" 真嗣的声音从她身后朦胧地传来。

"Go back to sleep, Shinji. I'm not here. This never happened."

回去睡觉吧，真嗣。我不在这里。这一切从未发生过。

"What are you doing here?"

你在这里做什么？

With a sigh Asuka turned around. Shinji half sat up in his bed before her. Self consciously she pulled down the hem of her short nightshirt.

阿苏卡叹了口气，转过身来。真嗣在她面前半坐起身。她下意识地拉了拉短睡衣的下摆。

"I-I was… " She stammered. "I was just making sure that you were okay, baka!" She said. "As your superior it's my duty to make sure that you're fit and well…. and… I thought…" Asuka sniffed again loudly as realised that she was starting to flounder.

"我...我是在..." 她结巴地说，"我只是在确认你没事，笨蛋！" 她说，"作为你的上级，我有责任确保你健康无恙...而且...我以为..." 阿苏卡再次大声吸了吸鼻子，意识到自己开始语无伦次了。

"Asuka?" Shinji said again with more concern in his voice. "Are you okay?"

"明日香？" 真嗣再次关切地问道，"你还好吗？"

She could feel a small dam inside of her straining to burst. For well over a year she would have given anything to hear those words from him. She had lived and struggled to keep them both alive for months without even the merest acknowledgement from him that he knew or even cared that she existed and how much she had fought and sacrificed for him. Now, finally, she could hear the concern, concern for her, in his voice.

她能感觉到内心深处的一道小堤坝正竭力想要崩溃。一年多来，她愿意付出一切，只为从他口中听到那些话。数月来，她努力维持两人的生活，挣扎着让他们都活下去，却连他最微小的认可都没有得到——他甚至不知道或不在乎她的存在，以及她为他所做的斗争和牺牲。如今，终于，她能从他的声音中听出对她的关切，那份关切是真真切切为她而存在的。

Its tone of offered comfort was almost more than she could bear.

它所提供的安慰语气几乎让她难以承受。

"I-I'm… I'm o-okay…" She sputtered, tears rolling unbidden down her cheeks. "I just… " She turned to leave again, wanting to flee before she lost control.

"我...我没事..." 她哽咽着，泪水不由自主地滑落脸颊。"我只是..." 她再次转身欲走，想要在失控前逃离。

"Asuka, what's wrong?" 明日香，怎么了？

She stopped in her tracks and turned around to face him. He was sitting up fully in the bed now, she could see his eyes shining in the dim moonlight.

她停下脚步，转身面对他。此刻，他已完全坐起在床上，她能看见他的眼睛在朦胧的月光中闪烁。

"I… I've missed you…" She said forlornly.

“我……我好想你……”她凄凉地说道。

"Missed me?" He replied in confusion.

"想我了吗？"他困惑地回答道。

She just nodded, wiping the tears from her hot cheeks.

她只是点了点头，擦去滚烫脸颊上的泪水。

"I… I… what do you mean?" He asked her.

"我……我……你是什么意思？" 他问她。

She walked back towards him and sat on the side of the bed, causing his eyes to widen slightly.

她朝他走回来，坐在床边，让他微微睁大了眼睛。

"I mean you, baka!" She whispered, poking him hard in the middle of his chest.

"我说的就是你，笨蛋！" 她低声说着，用力戳了戳他胸口正中。

"Oww.. " "哎呀.."

"I-I… " Asuka began, before choking on the words as she felt a fresh stream of tears overflowing from her eyes. "All I've done is fuck things up. I'm the best pilot! I'm supposed to have the plan… But… But Nothing I do is going right…. " She sniffed vainly as more tears flowed. "I… I was scared Shinji. Me! Scared! I'm never scared! I've fought so long… I've never been so scared as I was today!"

"我...我..." 明日香开口说道，却哽咽得说不出话来，泪水如泉涌般夺眶而出。"我所做的只是搞砸了一切。我是最优秀的飞行员！我应该有计划的...但是...但是我所做的一切都不顺利..." 她徒劳地吸了吸鼻子，更多的泪水随之流淌。"我...我害怕了，真嗣。我！害怕了！我从不害怕！我战斗了这么久...我从未像今天这样害怕过！"

Asuka buried her face in her hands, trying, even in the gloom of the bedroom, to hide her shame at weeping like some silly little girl in front of Shinji of all people!

明日香将脸埋在双手中，即使在卧室的昏暗中，也试图掩饰自己在所有人面前，尤其是在真嗣面前，像个傻乎乎的小女孩一样哭泣的羞愧！

"It's okay, Asuka." Shinji said, shocked at the display from the supposedly untouchable Asuka Langley Soryu. "I-I was scared too. When I was in the Angel I was scared that I would never see any of you again."

没事的，明日香。" 真嗣说道，对这位本应无懈可击的明日香·兰格雷的表现感到震惊。"我-我也害怕过。当我在使徒体内时，我害怕再也见不到你们中的任何一个了。

"No!" Asuka exclaimed, her voice still muffled by her hands. "You don't get it! I was scared that because of me you would die inside that Angel! Because I thought that I was so great that all I had to do was take your place in the battle and you'd be safe! Instead, I nearly lost you! I very nearly fucked up everything just because I thought that I was too good to fail! Instead of protecting you I thought that I'd lost you forever this time!"

不！" 明日香喊道，她的声音仍被双手捂住而显得模糊。"你不懂！我害怕的是因为我的缘故，你在那个使徒体内会死去！因为我自以为很了不起，只要在战斗中取代你的位置，你就会安全！结果，我差点失去了你！我差点因为自认为不会失败而搞砸了一切！我本想保护你，却以为这次永远失去了你！

She started as she felt his hand touch her on the shoulder. "Asuka." Shinji said softly. "You didn't fail. I'm here. I got out okay…" He smiled at her as she lifted her head out of her hands and looked at him.

她感觉到他的手触碰到她的肩膀，便开始说道：“明日香。” 真嗣轻声说道，“你没有失败。我在这里。我没事……” 他对着她微笑，而她则从双手中抬起头来，望向他。

"I know." She sniffed. "But I was scared that I'd lose you!"

“我知道。” 她抽泣着说，“但我害怕会失去你！”

"You didn't…" He answered "I'm still here Asuka."

"你没……"他回答道，"我还在这里，明日香。"

"I'm glad Shinji… I really am."

我很高兴，真嗣……我真的感到很高兴。

"Me too… it was really boring inside that Angel!" Shinji joked. Then he hesitated for a moment before taking a deep breath. "…and I-I'm sorry that I didn't talk to you… You know… before. I thought that you were just toying with me before…. I didn't think you would k-kiss someone like me unless you wanted to tease me about it… Sorry."

"我也是……在那个天使里面真的很无聊！" 真嗣打趣道。随后他犹豫了一下，深吸了一口气。"……还有，我……对不起，之前没有和你说话……你知道的……之前。我以为你只是在戏弄我……没想到你会亲吻像我这样的人，除非你是想为此取笑我……对不起。"

"Baka!" She said, smacking him lightly on the chest. "What kind of floozy do you think I am?"

笨蛋！" 她轻拍他的胸口说道。"你以为我是哪种轻浮的女人？

"I… I…" 我…我…

"Don't answer that!" She said with mock sternness.

"别回答那个！"她带着戏谑的严肃说道。

"Sorry." 对不起。

"And stop apologising!" 别再道歉了！

"Sorr… " He hung his head" …okay."

对不起…" 他低下头"…好吧。

A comfortable silence fell between the two pilots for several minutes. Eventually Shinji grew self conscious and took his hand off of Asuka's shoulder. The night air felt cold to her where his hand had been. She stared at her hands for a few more minutes, twisting the fabric of the hem of her nightshirt self-consciously.

两位飞行员之间陷入了几分钟的舒适沉默。最终，真嗣感到有些不自在，便把手从明日香的肩膀上移开。他的手曾停留的地方，夜风让她感到一丝寒意。她又盯着自己的手看了几分钟，不自在地扭动着睡衣下摆的布料。

"Shinji…" She spoke up at last.

"真嗣……" 她终于开口了。

"Yes." 是的。

"C-Can I stay here for a while? My bedroom feels so cold and empty." Asuka asked. She was glad for the darkness because she was sure that the heat of her blush was almost enough to be visible from Odawara otherwise.

"我能在这里待一会儿吗？我的卧室感觉好冷清。" 明日香问道。她庆幸此刻的黑暗，因为她确信自己脸颊的热度，若非如此，几乎能从小田原那边都看得见。

She smiled as she heard him swallow loudly. "S-s-sure, Asuka…" He stammered.

她听到他大声吞咽的声音，微笑着说：“当、当然，明日香……”他结巴地回答。

"Just for sleeping." She said. "No funny business!"

“只是用来睡觉的。”她说，“别搞什么花样！”

"Yes Asuka." He replied wearily, lying back down on the bed on rolling over on his side to face the window.

"好的，明日香。" 他疲惫地回答，重新躺回床上，翻身侧躺面向窗户。

Asuka pulled the cover back aside and shimmied in beside him. For a few minutes they lay awkwardly that way. Deliberately going out of their way not to touch each other. After a little longer Shinji heard Asuka murmur something like. "Ah, to hell with it." Before he could ask what she meant he felt two slender arms circle around his chest and the overwhelming scent of Asuka's shampoo envelope him as he felt her snuggle herself up against his back.

明日香拉回被子，侧身躺在他旁边。有好一会儿，他们就这样尴尬地躺着，刻意避免触碰到对方。过了一会儿，真嗣听到明日香喃喃自语：“啊，去他的。”还没等他问她是什么意思，就感觉到两条纤细的手臂环抱住他的胸膛，明日香洗发水的浓烈香气包围了他，同时感觉到她紧贴着他的背蜷缩起来。

Asuka grinned to herself as she felt his body tense up at such close contact between them. Right now she didn't care. She could feel herself surrounded by the smell of him that was so familiar to her. Sure he had a lot more flesh on his bones since last time she had held him like this in the night, but everything from the rhythm of his breathing to the warmth that radiated of his body felt like it belonged next to her like this.

明日香暗自窃笑，感受到他的身体在如此近距离的接触下紧绷起来。此刻她毫不在意。她能感觉到自己被他那熟悉至极的气息所包围。确实，与上次深夜这样拥抱他时相比，他身上的肉多了不少，但从他的呼吸节奏到身体散发出的温暖，一切都仿佛本应如此紧贴在她身旁。

Before many more minutes had passed Asuka Langley Soryu was in a blissfully deep sleep the likes of which she had not had since she had returned to Tokyo-3.

没过多久，阿苏卡·兰格蕾·索西尔就陷入了她自回到第三新东京市以来从未有过的深沉而幸福的睡眠之中。

Shinji, on the other hand, did not sleep a wink.

另一方面，真嗣一夜未眠。

End Chapter Eight 第八章结束

A/N: Yet another tough chapter to write. The early scenes were quite slow going and then, once Rei and Asuka had their little talk things just flowed nicely. Inspiration be a fickle mistress… Arrrrr!

作者注：又是一个难写的章节。开头部分进展相当缓慢，但一旦丽和明日香进行了那次小对话，情节就流畅起来了。灵感真是个善变的女神……啊！

I wanted to end on a bit of a WAFFy note. I figure Asuka has struggled and tried so hard to make a difference, without much joy, that the poor girl deserved a break. Not to mention I was worried that people might get sick of our heroine lurching from once disaster to another!

我想以一种温馨舒适（WAFFy）的调子结束。我认为明日香一直在努力奋斗，试图改变现状，却鲜有快乐，这个可怜的女孩理应得到一次休息。更不用说，我还担心人们可能会厌倦我们的女主角从一个灾难跌跌撞撞地走向另一个灾难！

Although there will be more trial and tribulations to come, from this point in the story Asuka starts to have more of an impact, so to speak, on the original timeline!

尽管未来还会有更多的考验和磨难，但从故事的这个节点开始，可以说，明日香对原有时空的影响力开始增强！

So… Please review let me know your thoughts on the story so far!

那么…请审阅并告诉我您对故事进展的看法！

Thanks for reading! 感谢阅读！

Cheers! 干杯！

Donderkind. 唐德金德。

P.S. On a side note, I realised a big continuity error in the middle of one of the major scenes in this chapter, which I had to re-write a big chunk of just an hour or so before writing this bit. Hopefully you can't tell where it was! :-)

附注：顺便一提，我发现在本章的一个主要场景中有一个很大的连贯性错误，我不得不在写这部分之前大约一个小时重写了一大段。希望你看不出来是哪里！:-)

Chapter 9: Asuka on the Shore III

第九章：明日香在岸边 III

Hey there! 嘿，你好！

First things first... I must apologise for the massive amount of time since I last updated. This chapter has been truly a toughie to write! It was a bit of a struggle in the early stages and then as I eventually did get under way it just kinda grew and grew. It just got a teensy bit too massive, (That doesn't actually make sense, does it?) so I've split it up into two chapters, mainly for ease of reading more than anything else!

首先，我必须为自上次更新以来所花费的大量时间道歉。这一章节确实难以撰写！在早期阶段就有些挣扎，然后当我终于开始着手时，它就逐渐变得越来越庞大。它变得稍微有点过于庞大，（这实际上并不合理，对吧？）因此我将其分为两章，主要是为了便于阅读，而不仅仅是为了其他原因！

*Apologies to Calovan, who I told over a month ago that this update was about a week or so away! Sorry, I guess I was overly optimistic about that!

向 Calovan 致歉，一个多月前我告诉他这次更新大约一周左右就会到来！抱歉，我想我当时过于乐观了！

*Also, a big thank you to jtdarkman for some much needed encouragement! It really helped me when I was struggling with motivation for this chapter. (Actually, after I split this update up, it was motivation for the next chapter! :-) ) Thanks man, I really appreciate it!

另外，非常感谢 jtdarkman 给予的极大鼓励！在我为这一章节的动力挣扎时，它真的帮了我大忙。（实际上，在我将这次更新分开后，它成了下一章的动力！:-)）谢谢你，我真的很感激！

So without further ado... here are the next two chapters of Unbroken!

那么，不再赘述……以下是 Unbroken 接下来的两个章节！

Enjoy! I hope... 享受吧！希望...

I've decided to differentiate between Rei and Rei/Lilith by simply calling Rei/Lilith just Lilith. Asuka will continue to call Lilith 'Wondergirl', just because, well, sometimes Asuka just likes to annoy people and/or supernatural beings.

我决定区分绫波丽和绫波丽/莉莉丝，简单地称绫波丽/莉莉丝为莉莉丝。明日香会继续称莉莉丝为“奇迹女孩”，只是因为，嗯，有时候明日香就是喜欢惹恼人和/或超自然存在。

Cheers! 干杯！

Unbroken 坚不可摧

## Chapter 9 Asuka on the Shore III

海岸上的明日香 III

Asuka moaned in her sleep and rolled over onto her back.

明日香在睡梦中呻吟着，翻身仰面躺着。

"Sssshinji…" She murmured dozily, feeling around for her bed-mate. "Shinji… I'm cold…"

真嗣…" 她迷迷糊糊地嘟囔着，伸手寻找她的床伴。"真嗣…我好冷…

Her questing hand found nothing in the coarse sand.

她探寻的手在粗糙的沙子中什么也没找到。

"Shinji… " She moaned, her brow creasing above her still closed eyes. "Come back to bed, Baka… It's freezing in here…"

真嗣…" 她呻吟着，眉头紧锁，双眼依旧紧闭。"笨蛋，回到床上来…这里冷得要命…

She made a few more small complaining noises, bringing her hands back to her naked body, trying to rid her hands of the rough gritty sand that now covered them.

她又发出了几声轻微的抱怨，将双手放回裸露的身体上，试图清除手上粗糙的沙粒。

'Wait a second… ' Her mind processed hazily. 'Sand..? Naked..?' With a gasp she opened her eyes.

'等一下…' 她的思绪朦胧地处理着。'沙子..？裸体..？' 她倒吸一口气，睁开了眼睛。

The black sky above her was cut across its face by the familiar bloody red slash of failed Instrumentality.

她头顶的夜空被那熟悉的血红色裂痕横贯，象征着失败的“人类补完计划”。

Asuka sat up with a groan and was greeted by the stark landscape of the dead sea shining luridly in the light of the full moon that was sinking towards the horizon. With a quick glance down she took in the almost forgotten though still intimately familiar map of scars and marks on her emaciated body

明日香呻吟着坐起身，映入眼帘的是死寂的海床，在满月即将沉入地平线的光芒下显得格外刺眼。她低头一瞥，便看到了自己瘦弱身躯上那些几乎遗忘却依旧熟悉的疤痕与印记。

"Fucking great one, Wondergirl!" She said out loud in anger. No answer was forthcoming. Looking around her she saw no sign of the ethereal pain in her ass that the former First Child had become. A darker shape against the white sand did catch her eye though.

"真他妈棒极了，神奇女孩！" 她愤怒地大声说道。没有回应传来。环顾四周，她没有看到那个曾经的第一少女如今已成为的幽灵般的麻烦。不过，一个与白沙形成对比的更暗的形状吸引了她的目光。

Forcing herself onto her hands and knees she painfully crawled the few feet between her and the rifle. Wrapping her scarred and blackened fingers around the wooden stock she used the ancient weapon as a crutch to haul herself up onto her feet. Asuka looked out across the wine dark sea towards the enormous full moon that was now almost touching the horizon.

她强迫自己用手和膝盖支撑着，痛苦地爬行了几英尺，来到步枪旁。她用那伤痕累累、焦黑的手指紧紧抓住木制枪托，借助这把古老的武器作为拐杖，艰难地站起身来。明日香望向那酒红色的海面，凝视着几乎触及地平线的巨大满月。

"What the hell am I doing back here again?" She asked the desolate shoreline.

"我到底又回到这里来干什么？" 她对着荒凉的海岸线自问。

The silence that answered her was oppressive.

回应她的沉默令人窒息。

Casting her gaze around she saw the clear trail of another set of footprints, similar in size to her own, leading away from where she now stood and continuing back towards the headland that she had initially come from all of that time ago. Asuka slung the rifle over her shoulder, it weight felt comforting and familiar, like an old friend. Shivering with the cold and feeling very alone she followed the other footprints along the beach.

她环顾四周，发现了一串与自己脚印大小相似的清晰足迹，从她现在站立的地方延伸出去，一直通向她很久以前最初来的那个海岬。明日香将步枪挎在肩上，那重量让人感到安心和熟悉，就像一位老朋友。她因寒冷而颤抖，感到非常孤独，便沿着另一串脚印沿着海滩前行。

Trying to still the butterfly of panic in her abdomen, she focused instead on her surroundings. There was something that was weird about the way the world appeared. As she trudged on she suddenly realised that it was because she was taller once again. She had gone from a fourteen year old girl to a perhaps seventeen year old woman in the blink of an eye. She was once again viewing the world from the higher perspective of near adulthood. Her joints jolted painfully with every step and her tongue once again found the gaps in her aching teeth. She had forgotten just how seriously crappy she had felt before coming back to Tokyo-03!

她试图平息腹部那只恐慌的蝴蝶，转而专注于周围的环境。这个世界看起来有些异样。当她继续前行时，突然意识到这是因为她再次变高了。转眼间，她从一个十四岁的女孩变成了可能十七岁的少女。她再次以接近成人的高度视角审视世界。每走一步，关节都痛苦地发出抗议，她的舌头再次触碰到疼痛牙齿间的空隙。她忘记了在回到东京-03 之前，自己曾是多么糟糕的感觉！

At last Asuka rounded the headland. Immediately her eyes were assaulted by the putrefying remainder of the split visage of Rei Ayanami out in the sea beyond. The horror of it caused the harsh bile to rise in her throat, with a effort of will she forced it back down.

终于，明日香绕过了海岬。刹那间，她的目光便被海面上漂浮的雷·绫波丽那裂开的腐烂面容所侵袭。这恐怖的景象令她喉咙中涌起一股苦涩，她费力地用意志将其压了下去。

Nearer to her, standing of the edge of the shoreline apparently gazing out at the face in the 'water' was a lone figure, too distant to identify. Now using the heavy old Enfield as a walking stick Asuka painfully picked up her pace. Soon the pale white skin and blue hair of the other answered her question. Lilith was engaged in a staring contest with her former glory.

离她更近一些，站在岸边边缘显然凝视着水面上的面孔的是一个孤独的身影，太远而无法辨认。现在，阿苏卡用那把沉重的老恩菲尔德步枪作为拐杖，痛苦地加快了步伐。很快，对方苍白的皮肤和蓝色的头发回答了她的疑问。莉莉丝正与她昔日的辉煌进行着一场凝视的对决。

Feeling the comforting heat of rage building within her, Asuka hefted the rifle into both hands and walking with purpose she cycled the bolt to bring a round up into the chamber. At the noise the figure turned to face her. The redhead strode on, now pointing the weapon out in front of her at the other inhabitant of the beach, who stared at her unreadably as she approached.

感受到内心升腾起的愤怒带来的慰藉，明日香双手紧握步枪，步伐坚定地拉动枪栓，将子弹推入膛室。听到声响，那身影转过身来面对她。红发少女继续前行，此刻已将武器对准海滩上的另一位居民，对方在她逼近时面无表情地凝视着她。

Finally she closed the distance and stood before the blue haired girl. Asuka braced her feet in the soft sand and kept the muzzle of the rifle pointing towards her adversary.

最终，她缩短了距离，站在蓝发女孩面前。明日香在柔软的沙地上稳住脚跟，将步枪的枪口始终对准对手。

"Pilot Soryu." Lilith said evenly.

"飞行员 Soryu。" Lilith 平静地说道。

"Wondergirl..." Asuka snarled out. "What the fuck am I doing here? And before you answer remember that I am carrying a loaded gun!"

"神奇女孩……" 明日香咆哮道，"我他妈在这里干什么？在你回答之前记住，我可是带着上了膛的枪！"

"Your weapon cannot harm me… " Lilith began.

"你的武器无法伤害到我……" 莉莉丝开始说道。

Kaboom. 轰隆。

The report from the old rifle rent the air. The sound was so loud on the otherwise silent beach that it drowned out the ricochet of the bullet as it deflected off of the hexagonal field that appeared briefly in front of the former First Child.

老式步枪的报告声划破空气。在这原本寂静的海滩上，枪声异常响亮，以至于子弹在六边形场地上短暂出现并反弹的声音都被淹没了，而那场地曾在前第一孩子的面前闪现。

Lilith narrowed her eyes at the German girl with disapproval.

莉莉丝不满地眯起眼睛看着那个德国女孩。

"Just testing." Asuka said with a sardonic smile.

“只是测试一下。”明日香带着嘲讽的微笑说道。

The blue haired being blinked at her and continued her stare without answering.

那位蓝发人眨了眨眼，继续盯着她，没有回答。

"So, once more then… Why the hell am I here, again?" Asuka was almost shouting. "Is this another one of those stupid clichéd dreams where you advise me that time is running short? Or do you enjoy this kind of thing? Like it's some kind of ethereal power trip to show me that you're running the show? Or do you just have a thing for malnourished naked girls with guns?"

所以，再来一次……我他妈为什么又在这里？”明日香几乎是在吼叫。“这是否又是那种愚蠢的老套梦境，你来提醒我时间不多了？还是你就喜欢这种事？像是某种超凡的权力游戏，向我展示你才是掌控者？或者你只是对那些拿着枪的瘦弱裸女有特殊癖好？”

Lilith stared at her for another few moments before turning her back to Asuka and resuming her contemplation of the desolation of failed Impact.

莉莉丝又凝视了她片刻，随后转过身背对明日香，继续沉思着那次失败的冲击所带来的荒芜。

"Answer me for fuck's sake!" The redhead was screaming now. "I'm out there, trying my God-damned best, risking my ass trying to keep it all together with the whole fucking World against me because of you!" She threw the rifle angrily to the ground. "Or is that how you get off? Are you entertained by my misery and failure? Is that it? Do you get your ethereal rocks off watching me blundering around Tokyo-3 looking like a god damned lunatic?"

"看在上帝的份上，回答我！"红发女子此刻尖叫着。"我在外面拼尽全力，冒着生命危险试图维持一切，全因你而与整个该死的世界为敌！"她愤怒地将步枪摔在地上。"还是说这就是你的乐趣？你从我的痛苦和失败中得到快感吗？是这样吗？看着我在东京-3 像个该死的疯子一样四处乱窜，你是不是就心满意足了？"

Still Lilith did not move or acknowledge the redhead's anger.

尽管如此，莉莉丝依旧没有动弹，也没有理会红发女子的怒气。

"Fucking look at me Wondergirl! The least you can do is look me in the fucking eye and answer me!"

该死的，看着我，神奇女孩！你至少可以直视我的眼睛并回答我！

With a cry Asuka launched herself at the other girl, but as she reached her there was a flash and a jolt that Asuka felt down to her bones. The next thing the redhead knew was that she was once again lying face up on the sand, with stars before her eyes and the crimson arc splitting the firmament above her.

随着一声尖叫，明日香向另一个女孩扑去，但当她接近时，一道闪光和一阵震动穿透了她的骨髓。接下来红发女孩所知道的是，她再次仰面躺在沙滩上，眼前是繁星点点，头顶上空那道猩红的弧线划破了天际。

Sitting herself up and shaking her head painfully Asuka groaned as she struggled back up onto shaky legs.

阿苏卡艰难地坐起身，痛苦地摇了摇头，呻吟着努力站回颤抖的双腿上。

"You could have just said something Wondergirl." She said more quietly. "You didn't have to deploy a freaking AT-Field against me!"

"你本可以直接说点什么的，奇迹少女。" 她更轻声地说，"你没必要对我用那该死的 AT 立场！"

Finally, Lilith turned from the sea to face her. To Asuka's shock there was a look of real sadness in her deep red eyes.

最终，莉莉丝从海面转过身来面对她。令明日香震惊的是，她那深红色的眼睛里流露出真正的悲伤。

"Instrumentality has failed. Humanity, my children, have failed. Nothing is left on this dead planet." Lilith said softly. "It is all for nothing that I have laboured and suffered at their hands."

"工具性已经失败。人类，我的孩子们，已经失败了。这个死寂的星球上什么也不剩了。" 莉莉丝轻声说道，"我为他们劳苦和受难，一切都是徒劳。"

"What the hell are you on about Wondergirl?"

"你到底在说什么啊，神奇女孩？"

"You." The blue haired being said flatly. "Your presence has not yet effected any significant change. You were not able to prevent the young Ikari from falling against the 12th. Despite your efforts he has not yet diverged from the path that led to his despair. You have failed. As I see it from this point, Third Impact will occur as it did also in this plane. Humanity is all but lost."

“你。”蓝发存在平淡地说道，“你的出现尚未带来任何重大改变。你未能阻止年轻的碇真嗣败给第 12 号使徒。尽管你努力了，他仍未偏离导致他绝望的那条路。你失败了。从这一点来看，第三次冲击将如这个时空一样发生。人类几乎注定要灭亡。”

"J-Just wait a fucking second…" Asuka began, a sick feeling growing in the pit of her stomach. "Y-You mean that's it? One thing doesn't go your way and you've given up? Shinji gets swallowed by one Angel, and still defeats it, and you're throwing in the towel?"

"就他妈等一下…" 明日香开口道，胃里涌起一阵恶心感。"你-你的意思是就这样了？一件事不顺你的意，你就放弃了？真嗣被一个使徒吞噬，还能战胜它，而你却要认输？"

"There was only ever a limited time for you to effect any change. That time is almost up. You have as yet been unwilling or unable to effect any significant change. Humanity is lost." She repeated.

你影响任何改变的时间从来都是有限的，现在这个时间即将结束。你至今仍不愿或无法带来任何重大改变。人类已经迷失了。她重复道。

"Fine, so you're giving up?" Asuka yelled at Lilith. "So I'm guessing you've brought me back here so that I can starve to death on this god-damned beach for my sins?"

"好吧，所以你放弃了？" 明日香对着莉莉丝喊道。"那我猜你把我带回这里，是为了让我因为我的罪孽在这个该死的沙滩上饿死？"

"Anger begets nothing." Lilith answered sternly. "Despite all you have gone through, you still have not changed. Your pride will do nothing to save my children from their fate. Your pride will not save Ikari-kun from falling into despair. Your pride will not comfort you when all else is lost."

"愤怒生不出任何东西。"莉莉丝严厉地回答，"尽管你经历了那么多，你依然未曾改变。你的骄傲无法挽救我的孩子们免于他们的命运。你的骄傲也无法阻止碇君陷入绝望。当一切尽失时，你的骄傲也无法给予你慰藉。"

"What the hell did you expect me to do?" Asuka countered. "Back there I'm just one fourteen year old girl! How am I supposed to bring down a global conspiracy of the most powerful men in the history of the world who want to moosh Humanity into bouillabaisse? I'm not even allowed out of the apartment after 8pm for heaven's sake!"

"你到底指望我做什么？" 明日香反驳道，"在那里，我只是一个十四岁的女孩！我怎么可能去揭露那些历史上最有权势的人策划的全球阴谋，他们还想把人类搅成一锅汤？天哪，我晚上 8 点后甚至都不被允许离开公寓！"

Lilith looked at her sadly. "That is why you fail."

莉莉丝悲伤地看着她，说：“这就是你失败的原因。”

Asuka felt just about ready to lose it completely "Don't you dare start going all fucking 'Yoda' on me, Wondergirl! Just try speaking clearly for once in your life! Tell me how I'm supposed to bring down NERV, SEELE and the fucking UN when I can't even get Kaji to believe me when I try to tell him the truth?"

明日香几乎要彻底崩溃了，“你敢再给我装神弄鬼，学尤达大师说话试试，奇迹女孩！这辈子能不能有一次把话说清楚！告诉我，我怎么才能摧毁 NERV、SEELE 和该死的联合国，连我试图告诉加持真相时他都不相信我？”

"Again it is your pride which stops you from progressing child." Lilith answered sternly. "When you were sent back there was never any suggestion that you would be able to foil the machinations of the old men who, in their folly, sought godhood for themselves."

"孩子，又是你的骄傲阻碍了你的进步。"莉莉丝严厉地回答，"当你被送回去时，从未有人暗示过你能挫败那些老者们的阴谋，他们因自己的愚蠢而妄图成神。"

Asuka frowned in confusion. "But…"

明日香皱着眉头，一脸困惑。“但是…”

"Do you remember why it was that you were sent back?"

你还记得为什么被送回来吗？

"T-To stop Third Impact?"

"为了阻止第三次冲击？"

"No." The other girl answered flatly.

"不。" 另一个女孩平淡地回答。

Now it was Asuka's turn to stare dumbly.

现在轮到明日香目瞪口呆了。

"In your world, there is one person. One being who's importance and influence is above all others. One who can become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds and so condemn Humankind to oblivion if he so wishes."

在你的世界中，有这样一个人，其重要性和影响力超越了所有人。他有能力成为死亡，世界的毁灭者，并因此将人类推向湮灭的深渊，只要他愿意。

"You mean Gendo?" Asuka asked. "No, wait… That Keele guy!"

"你是说源堂？" 明日香问道，"不，等等……是那个基尔的家伙！"

"You have often boasted of your superior intellect, child." Was Lilith's prim answer.

"你常夸耀自己超群的才智，孩子。"莉莉丝一本正经地回答。

Several long seconds passed.

几秒钟缓缓流逝。

"Shinji?" Asuka said incredulously.

"真嗣？" 明日香难以置信地说。

"Yes." 是的。

"Shinji… " Asuka repeated, feeling just a little foolish. That had been the reason she had been sent back after all. "Yeah… well I knew that… A-And I have been trying to protect him! I was ready to dive into the Dirac sea and use Unit 02's AT-Field to protect him, but … Unit 01 tore its way out of there anyway. What was I supposed to do?"

"真嗣…" 明日香重复道，感到有些愚蠢。毕竟，这就是她被送回来的原因。"嗯…我知道的…而且我一直在努力保护他！我准备跳进狄拉克海，用 02 机体的 AT 力场保护他，但是…01 机体还是强行冲了出来。我还能怎么办呢？"

"Pilot Soryu." Lilith answered. "At no stage have I requested that you protect him from any external threat."

"飞行员 Soryu。" Lilith 回答道，"我从未要求你为他抵御任何外部威胁。"

"Well, you could have fooled me! What the hell was I supposed to do with him then? Make him breakfast in bed? Do his geography homework? Jump his scrawny ass until he can't see straight? You threw me out there alone, Wondergirl, it hasn't been easy trying to save the fucking world without anyone giving me even the slightest clue of how I'm actually supposed to do it!"

哦，你差点就骗到我了！那我他妈的到底该怎么对他？给他做床上早餐？帮他做地理作业？跳到他那瘦弱的屁股上直到他看不清东西？你把我一个人扔在那里，神奇女孩，没有人在我试图拯救这个该死的世界时给我哪怕一丁点提示，这可真不容易！

Lilith looked at her evenly. "Those options may have been more effective than your actual course of action, Pilot Soryu." She replied eventually.

莉莉丝平静地看着她，最终回答道：“那些选择可能比你实际采取的行动更为有效，飞行员苏流。”

Asuka suddenly felt the anger drain out of her body. She could feel a warm blush spread across her cheeks as she took in the implications of what Lilith had said.

明日香突然感到怒气从体内消散。当她领会到莉莉丝话语中的含义时，能感觉到一股温暖的潮红在脸颊上蔓延开来。

"So… you wanted me to just be nice to him? Make him feel like he's not alone? Is that it."

“所以……你是想让我对他好一点？让他感觉自己并不孤单？是这样吗？”

"Correct." 正确。

Asuka frowned. "B-But I am nice to him…" She said forlornly. "I-I've even been sleeping in his bed for the last week. You know… To make him feel better…"

明日香皱起了眉头。“可我对他很好啊……”她沮丧地说，“我……我甚至这周都睡在他的床上。你知道的……为了让他感觉好点……”

"No Pilot Soryu." Lilith replied sternly. "You have been seduced by the comforts of your previous life and returned all too easily to your former self. You have been sleeping in his bed for the last week because it makes you feel better. Is that not true? Since Third Impact you have not been able to sleep without him sharing your bed?"

"没有 Soryu 驾驶员。" Lilith 严肃地回答，"你被过去生活的舒适所诱惑，轻易地回到了原来的自己。过去一周你一直睡在他的床上，因为这让你感觉更好。难道不是这样吗？自从第三次冲击以来，你没有他共享你的床就无法入睡吗？"

"Y-Yeah.. but he likes it too!"

"是啊..但他也喜欢呢！"

"Does he? Do you know that? What was it you said to him before you went to sleep last night?"

他真的吗？你知道这个吗？昨晚睡觉前你跟他说了什么？

"I-I can't remember…" "我...我记不起来了…"

"Did you not say: "If you try anything perverted, Third Child, I'll rip your arm off and beat you to death with the soggy end?"" Lilith said. The repeated threat sounding all the more damning because of the flat tone in which she repeated it.

"你不是说过吗：'要是你敢搞什么变态的把戏，三号小子，我就把你的胳膊扯下来，用湿漉漉的那头把你打死？'"莉莉丝说道。她用平淡的语气重复这个威胁，反而让这话听起来更加恶毒。

"Maybe… " Asuka replied. "But, it was a joke… Shinji knows that's just how I talk! Anyway… you didn't see what he did in that hospital room before Third Impact! I have to be sure that he knows that I'm not going to be abused like that again!"

"或许吧…" 明日香回答道，"但那只是个玩笑…真嗣知道我说话就这样！不管怎样…你没看到他在第三次冲击前在医院病房里做的事！我必须确保他明白，我不会再忍受那样的虐待了！"

"What he did there was a by-product of his own self hatred. It was also what finally sent him over the precipice of despair and self loathing from which he never fully returned. The Third Child on your current plane is virtually incapable of such degradation. He does care for you, Pilot Soryu. But he also fears you. Those conflicting emotions within him are driving him closer to destruction than even he realises. If you cannot ease his uncertainty then Humanity is doomed to fail as it has before."

他在那里的所作所为，是他自我憎恨的副产品。也正是这最终将他推向绝望与自我厌恶的深渊，他再也未能完全从中恢复。在你当前层面上的第三子，几乎不可能堕落至此。他确实在乎你，飞行员 Soryu。但他也惧怕你。他内心这些矛盾的情感正将他推向毁灭，甚至他自己都未曾意识到。如果你不能缓解他的不确定感，那么人类注定会重蹈覆辙，再次失败。

Asuka held her head in her hands. "Holy crap… So no pressure then!" She whispered to herself. "So basically I have to make him see that I care for him too? Ease his fragile ego through the last shitty days before Impact and hope that he's strong enough not to tip over the edge anyway?"

明日香双手抱头，喃喃自语：“天哪……那岂不是毫无压力！”她心想，“这么说来，我得让他明白我也在乎他？在冲击来临前的糟糕日子里，安抚他那脆弱的自尊，并祈祷他足够坚强，不至于崩溃？”

"Do you not care for him?"

"你难道不在乎他吗？"

"Well…. Yes, of course I do!" Asuka answered haughtily. "I don't just go kissing or climbing into bed with just anyone, you know!"

"嗯……是的，当然我懂！" 明日香傲慢地回答，"我可不是随便就和人亲吻或上床的，你知道的！"

"Then you need to allow him to see that."

那么你需要让他看到这一点。

"So basically, I have to be 'nice' to him? Show him that I really do lo… c-care for him" Asuka said uncertainly.

所以基本上，我得对他‘好’？让他知道我确实很在乎他。”明日香不确定地说道。

"Are your stated feelings for him true?"

你对他的表白是真心的吗？

"Y-Yeah…" Asuka answered coyly. Not really believing that she was having this conversation.

"嗯...嗯..." 明日香羞涩地回答道。她几乎不敢相信自己正在经历这场对话。

"Then why should he not believe you?"

那么他为什么不应该相信你呢？

The redhead screwed up her face slightly. "You know… That kinda stuff.. it's not really my style… He'd never believe it!"

红发女子微微皱起脸。“你知道的……那种事……实在不是我的风格……他绝不会相信的！”

"Nonetheless, I will allow you to continue so that you may perhaps have a positive influence on him and prevent this abomination." Lilith gestured towards the putrefying visage out to sea.

尽管如此，我还是会允许你继续，或许你能对他产生积极影响，阻止这场灾难。" 莉莉丝指向海面上那腐烂的面容。

"Thanks, Wondergirl." Asuka answered with some relief. "And if you don't mind… is there another way that you can 'advise' me rather than bringing me back here? Perhaps hide in the ducted heating? Or maybe you could be like my invisible friend? You know… like Obi-wan Ayanami or The Great Gazoo or something like that? 'Cos I gotta say, this place is kinda depressing!"

"谢谢，神奇女孩。" 明日香回答时带着些许宽慰，"如果你不介意的话……有没有其他方式可以'指导'我，而不是把我带回这里？比如藏在暖气管道里？或者你可以成为我的隐形朋友？你知道的……就像绫波丽的欧比旺，或者伟大的加佐之类的？因为说真的，这个地方有点让人郁闷！"

Lilith appeared to think for a few moments. "I already exist in one form on that plane. If I were to manifest in my current state there it may cause a paradox that risks the destruction of myself or perhaps one of my other forms. I have done what I can there via one of my former vessels. I believe that she has sought you out before this?"

莉莉丝似乎沉思了片刻。“我在那个层面上已经以一种形式存在了。如果我以目前的形态在那里显现，可能会引发一个悖论，这有可能导致我自身的毁灭，或者也许是我的其他形态之一。我通过我以前的一个容器在那里已经尽力了。我相信她之前已经找过你了？”

"Ayanami?" Asuka said in confusion. "Sure… She has been following me around a bit lately. Creepy kid. You mean you've been talking to her?"

"绫波？"明日香困惑地说道，"当然……她最近确实有点跟着我。真是个让人毛骨悚然的小孩。你是说你一直在和她说话吗？"

"No, that would be too dangerous." Lilith said. "But I am able to influence her thinking at certain times and points. She may be able to assist you if you wish it."

"不，那太危险了。" 莉莉丝说，"但在某些时刻和节点，我能影响她的想法。如果你愿意，她或许能帮助你。"

"Sure… I'll think about it." Asuka replied uncertainly.

"当然……我会考虑一下的。" 明日香不确定地回答道。

"Very well. But now you must wake up Asuka."

很好。但现在你必须唤醒明日香。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Wake up Asuka!" 醒醒，明日香！

"What the hell are you on about?"

你到底在说什么？

"Asuka, you gotta get up!" Lilith's voice had changed to one more familiar to her.

"明日香，你得起来了！" 莉莉丝的声音变得对她来说更加熟悉了。

Asuka's eyes opened to the worried face of Shinji Ikari leaning over her in the gloom of his bedroom.

明日香的眼睛睁开了，映入眼帘的是真嗣·碇那张充满担忧的脸庞，在昏暗的卧室中俯身靠近她。

"Waaaaugh!" Asuka screamed before Shinji's hand clamped over her mouth to muffle the noise.

"哇啊啊！" 阿苏卡尖叫道，随即真嗣的手捂住了她的嘴，以压低声音。

"Asuka!" He whispered. "You've got to be quiet! You'll wake Misato!"

"明日香！" 他低声说，"你得小声点！会把美里吵醒的！"

The German girl reached up and forcibly removed Shinji's hand from over her mouth.

德国女孩伸手用力将真嗣捂在她嘴上的手移开。

"Uh… Sorry." He said sheepishly. "But I had to stop you from screaming so loud."

“呃…对不起。”他有些不好意思地说，“但我必须阻止你尖叫得那么大声。”

Quickly regaining her bearings Asuka realised that it was 6:30am. The time that Shinji usually got out of bed and began to prepare everyone's breakfasts and lunches. At that time she would always carefully sneak back to her own room for another hour or so more sleep. That way, hopefully, Misato would remain none the wiser about Asuka's recent nocturnal visits.

迅速找回方向感的明日香意识到此刻是早上 6:30。那是真嗣通常起床开始为大家准备早餐和午餐的时间。而那时，她总会小心翼翼地溜回自己的房间，再睡上一个小时左右。这样，希望美里就不会察觉到明日香最近的夜间造访。

Asuka closed her eyes again and sighed in relief. She was back. She was off of that awful beach with its disgusting giant head and annoying inhabitant. She was back and things were normal again! Her eyes fluttered open once more.

明日香再次闭上眼睛，松了一口气。她回来了。她离开了那个可怕的海滩，那里有一个令人作呕的巨大头颅和烦人的居民。她回来了，一切又恢复正常了！她的眼睛再次轻轻睁开。

Shinji was still leaning over her with an apprehensive look on his face. Without giving him a chance to pull away she reached up from where she lay and wrapped both of her arms around him tightly.

真嗣依旧俯身在她上方，脸上带着忧虑的神情。她没有给他撤离的机会，而是从躺着的位置伸出手，紧紧地用双臂环抱住了他。

"Urk…" He said. "呃……" 他说。

"Guten morgen, Shinji-kun!" She whispered in his ear.

"早上好，真嗣君！" 她在他耳边轻声说道。

"Uh… G-Good morning Asuka!" He stammered.

"呃…早安，明日香！" 他结巴地说道。

"Thank you for letting me sleep here!" She said brightly.

"谢谢你让我在这里睡觉！" 她开心地说。

"You're welcome, I guess." He replied.

"不客气，我想。" 他回答道。

She continued to cling onto him for several more minutes.

她又继续紧紧依偎着他好几分钟。

"A-Asuka?" He said eventually.

"飞鸟？" 他终于开口说道。

"Yes, Shinji?" "是的，真嗣？"

"I better go and start making breakfast before Misato gets up!"

我最好在美里起床前去准备早餐！

"Sure…" She replied. "You know, Shinji?" Asuka said as she finally let go of the boy.

"当然…" 她回答道。"你知道吗，真嗣？" 明日香终于放开了那个男孩，说道。

"Yeah?" "是吗？"

"You always make our breakfasts!"

你总是给我们做早餐！

"I-I don't mind." Shinji answered.

"我...我不介意。" 真嗣回答道。

Asuka rolled over and sat up on the side of Shinji's bed, her hair askew from her disturbed night's sleep. "Well, that doesn't make it right!" She said. "Tell you what, Shinji my boy! I'm going to make you Breakfast in Bed! How does that sound?"

明日香翻了个身，坐在真嗣床边，一夜未安的睡眠让她的头发凌乱不堪。“好吧，那也不代表它是对的！”她说道，“告诉你，真嗣，小伙子！我要给你做一顿床上早餐！听起来怎么样？”

"That's alright Asuka, you don't have to do… "

"Uh-uh, Shinji! You don't get to say 'no' to this! I'm gonna make you breakfast and there's nothing you can do about it! What'll you have?"

哎呀，真嗣！你可不能拒绝这个！我要给你做早餐，你可阻止不了我！你想吃什么？

"Um…" Shinji hesitated nervously. "I usually have some steamed rice, miso soup and some natto… "

"呃……" 真嗣有些紧张地犹豫着，"我通常会吃一些蒸米饭、味噌汤和纳豆……"

"How about an omelette?"

"来个煎蛋卷怎么样？"

"Well… " “嗯……”

"An omelette it is then!" Asuka interrupted brightly, pulling on a pair of shorts and bustling out of the room before he could reply.

"那就吃煎蛋吧！" 明日香兴高采烈地打断他，迅速穿上一条短裤，没等他回应就匆匆离开了房间。

Shinji smiled to himself as he sat back down on his bed. Asuka really was a complete mystery to him. Sure, she was nice to him like this when they're alone. But later on, he knew, when they were out with others, he was sure that she'd treat him like dirt yet again. That didn't mean he couldn't enjoy it while it lasted. 'I guess she's right, that does make me kind of pathetic.' He thought with a small smile.

真嗣坐回床上，暗自微笑。明日香对他来说确实是个完全的谜。当然，像这样独处时她对他很好。但之后，他知道，当他们和别人在一起时，他确信她又会像对待泥土一样对待他。这并不意味着他不能享受这段时光。'我想她是对的，这确实让我有点可悲。' 他带着一丝微笑想道。

He lay back on top of the covers as he listened contentedly to the sounds of pots and pans being clattered around inexpertly in the kitchen.

他惬意地躺在被子上，聆听着厨房里锅碗瓢盆被不太熟练地碰撞发出的声响。

So this is almost what you would call the prologue to chapter 10. I hope that you liked!

这几乎可以说是第 10 章的序言了。希望你喜欢！

Cheers! 干杯！

Unbroken 坚不可摧

## Chapter 10 Swings and Roundabouts

秋千与旋转木马

"…and another reason why this school sucks is they take us on these lame excursions and expect us to be all like, "Oh wow!" and crap like that!"

…还有另一个这所学校糟糕的原因是他们带我们去那些无聊的郊游，还指望我们表现得像，“哇哦！”之类的！

"Yeah… sure Asuka." 是啊…当然，飞鸟。

"I mean, Tokyo-3 Municipal Zoo, for crying out loud! I bet that it's just a bunch of moth-eaten macaques and a cognitively impaired elephant!"

我的意思是，东京-3 市立动物园，拜托！我敢打赌，那里只有一群毛发稀疏的猕猴和一只认知障碍的大象！

"Uh-huh." 嗯哼。

"Seriously, look at the guide we've got!" Asuka continued her rant as she pointed to the middle aged Zoo employee that stood by the main entrance holding a clipboard. "Does he even think that we're gonna take him seriously with that comb-over?"

说真的，看看我们这儿的指南！" 明日香继续发着牢骚，指着站在主入口处的中年动物园员工，他手里拿着一个写字夹板。"他那发型，我们能把他当回事吗？

"Mmm…" 嗯……

"Are you even listening to me Hikari?"

你甚至有在听我说话吗，光？

"Uhh… " The Class Representative replied distractedly, looking back as several more of their classmates got out of the school bus and milled noisily in the car park.

"呃……" 班长心不在焉地回答，回头看着更多的同学从校车上下来，在停车场里喧闹地聚集。

"Hmph." Asuka pouted at her best friend, who was blatantly ignoring the redhead's growing irritation as she continued to watch where Shinji, Kensuke and Touji lounged casually near the side of the bus. The taller boy was standing and appeared to be doing most of the talking as the other two boys sat with their backs against its side and listened as the growing gaggle of middle-schoolers milled around them in the car park.

"哼。" 明日香对着她最好的朋友撅起了嘴，后者明显无视了这位红发女孩逐渐增长的恼怒，继续关注着碇真嗣、剑介和冬二在巴士旁悠闲地坐着。那个高个子男孩站着，似乎是主要发言者，而另外两个男孩背靠巴士坐着，倾听着，一群中学生在他们周围的车场上聚集。

Asuka smiled to herself at Hikari's distraction. She cold never understand what her sweet, intelligent, kindly best friend saw in that ridiculous jock. Though she did have to admit that every time she looked at Suzuhara since she had returned she felt a certain complex pang of guilt and regret at the fate that he suffered at the hands of Eva.

明日香对光的心不在焉暗自微笑。她永远无法理解她那甜美、聪明、善良的最好朋友看上了那个可笑的运动员什么。尽管她不得不承认，自从她回来后，每次看到铃原，她都会感到一种复杂的内疚和悔恨，因为他遭受了 Eva 的命运。

Still, she had to admit that she was more than a little annoyed at the complete lack of regard that Hikari was giving her. Then an evil idea struck her. 'Why not?' she thought with a small grin. 'It'll be easy enough to deny and say it was all a joke to try and get her to pay attention!'

尽管如此，她不得不承认，自己对光完全无视她的态度感到相当恼火。这时，一个邪恶的念头闪过她的脑海。'为什么不呢？' 她带着一丝坏笑想，'否认起来很容易，就说这一切只是个玩笑，目的是想让她注意到我！'

"Hey Hikari," Asuka said with a sly grin. "You know that Shinji and I have been sleeping together for nearly a week now?"

嘿，光，" 明日香带着狡黠的笑容说，"你知道我和真嗣已经一起睡了快一个星期了吗？

"Uh-huh.." They pig-tailed girl answered her.

"嗯嗯.." 扎着双马尾的女孩回答她。

As Asuka suspected, Hikari was almost completely unaware of her presence.

正如 Asuka 所料，Hikari 几乎完全没有意识到她的存在。

"Well, not sleeping together in the ecchi sense! Actually just sleeping, you know, in the same bed?"

嗯，不是那种色情的同床共枕！其实是真的只是睡觉，你知道的，就是睡在同一张床上？

"Yeah, sure…" 嗯，当然…

"I just didn't want you to think of me as some kind of trollop, I am still a virgin after all!" Asuka continued, strangely enjoying herself. "Though I don't think Shinji has actually been getting that much sleep, the poor sap! Judging by the big dark circles under his eyes, that is!"

我只是不想让你觉得我是个轻浮的人，毕竟我还是个处女！" 明日香继续说道，奇怪地感到愉悦。"不过我觉得真嗣其实也没怎么睡好，可怜的家伙！看他眼睛下面那大黑圈就知道了！

Hikari just nodded, her eyes still fixed on where Touji was standing, obviously recounting some tale of sporting prowess.

光只是点了点头，目光依旧停留在东治刚才站立的地方，显然在回忆他讲述的体育英勇事迹。

"Though I've gotta say that I haven't slept this well in ages! You really should try it with Suzuhara some time!" Asuka continued, a wicked grin on her face.

尽管我得说，我已经很久没有睡得这么香了！你真该找个时间跟铃原试试！" 明日香继续说道，脸上带着一丝狡黠的笑容。

"Sure… Why not…" Hikari answered. "Wait." She turned to half look at the German girl quizzically. "What was that about Touji?"

"当然……为什么不……"光回答道。"等等。"她半转过身，好奇地看着那个德国女孩。"那关于冬二的事是什么？"

"Hikari!" Asuka exclaimed in frustration. "You really are hopeless! You haven't been paying attention to a single word that I've been saying, have you?"

"光！" 明日香沮丧地喊道，"你真是没救了！我说的每一个字你都没听进去，对吧？"

"Y-You were saying something about Touji… a-and Shinji?" The Class Rep ventured. "I think it was something about how we should stay with them, you know, once we get inside?"

“你刚才提到东治……还有真嗣？”班长试探着问，“我想你说的是，一旦我们进去，我们应该和他们待在一起，对吧？”

"Arrrgh!" Asuka face-palmed in frustration, and also to hide her relief that Hikari hadn't actually been listening to her. "Will you stop drooling over that dumb jock!"

"啊！" 明日香懊恼地捂住脸，同时也是为了掩饰自己因为光并没有真的在听她说话而感到的宽慰。"你能不能别再对那个蠢运动员流口水了！"

Hikari blushed a fetching shade of crimson. "I am not drooling over Touji!" She whispered fervently. "A good Class Representative observes and supervises the students under her care at all times!"

光的脸颊染上了一抹迷人的绯红。“我可没有对透二流口水！”她热切地低声说道，“一个优秀的班长应该时刻观察和监督她所负责的学生！”

"Bah!" Asuka snorted derisively. "I'm not as stupid as your boyfriend looks Hikari!"

"哼！" 明日香轻蔑地哼了一声，"我才不像你男朋友看起来那么蠢呢，光！"

"Touji is not my boyfriend!" Hikari answered haughtily, ignoring the way the redhead rolled her eyes. Asuka didn't miss the misty sheen that seemed to descend over her friends eyes as it seemed she contemplated the possibility of such a coupling.

"透二才不是我的男朋友呢！" 光傲慢地回答，无视了红发女孩翻白眼的动作。明日香没有错过朋友们眼中似乎因思考这种可能而蒙上的雾气。

"Fine, whatever." 好吧，随便。

A brief silence descended over the two friends as the last of the combined 2nd year classes were finally disgorged from the bus.

当二年级的最后一批学生终于从巴士上鱼贯而出时，两位朋友之间陷入了短暂的沉默。

"So," Hikari said finally. "Should, ah, we go over and see what the boys are doing?"

“那么，”光最后说道，“我们是不是应该过去看看那些男生在做什么？”

Asuka sighed, blowing her hair up off of her forehead in frustration. "Sure, sounds great." She muttered, but Hikari was already several metres away and moving purposefully to where the three students in question were standing.

明日香叹了口气，烦躁地吹起额前的头发。“当然，听起来不错。”她低声嘟囔，但此时光已经走出好几米远，正朝着那三个学生所在的地方快步走去。

" …and that's the last time that Koichi kid will ever dream of taking on the mighty arm of Touji 'The Tomahawk' Suzuhara!"

……而那将是小男孩儿科一最后一次梦想挑战图治·“战斧”·铃原的强大臂膀！

The Tomahawk finished his tale of baseball heroism and looked back down at his two friends for what he felt was some much deserved adulation. What he saw sadly disappointed him. Kensuke was busy fiddling with the settings on his digital camcorder and Shinji was staring off into the middle distance, his eyes unfocussed and face a mask of tired disinterest.

战斧讲述完他的棒球英勇事迹后，满心期待地回头望向两位朋友，希望能得到应有的赞赏。然而，眼前的情景却令他大失所望。健介正忙着摆弄他的数码摄像机设置，而真嗣则目光涣散地凝视着远方，脸上写满了疲惫与漠然。

"So?" Touji said impatiently. "What do you think?"

"所以呢？" 东治不耐烦地说，"你怎么看？"

"About what?" Shinji asked, suddenly realising that his friend had been talking.

"关于什么？" 真嗣问道，突然意识到他的朋友一直在说话。

"I'm in the middle of something here!" Kensuke muttered impatiently, continuing to adjust the settings on his camera.

"我这儿正忙着呢！" 健介不耐烦地嘟囔着，继续调整他的相机设置。

"Jeez," The track-suited boy complained. "You guys are hopeless! You weren't even listening to me, were you?"

"天哪，" 穿着运动服的男孩抱怨道，"你们真是没救了！你们根本就没听我说话，对吧？"

"Sorry." Shinji said absently. "I was just… uh… thinking."

"对不起。" 真嗣心不在焉地说，"我刚才只是……呃……在思考。"

"Mmm…" The spectacled boy replied without looking up.

"嗯……" 戴眼镜的男孩回答道，没有抬头。

Touji looked at the other boy. "Why did you even bring your camera here today, Kensuke? You only ever wanna film Evas and military stuff. A school day trip to Tokyo-3 Zoo isn't gonna have any of that crap!"

冬二看着另一个男孩。“今天你为什么还带着相机来，健介？你只对拍摄 EVA 和军事内容感兴趣。学校组织的东京-3 动物园一日游可不会有那些玩意儿！”

Kensuke didn't even look up as he answered. "A good cameraman is always prepared!" He said earnestly. "We live in uncertain times my friends. You never know what may be just around the corner!"

健介回答时甚至没有抬头。“一个优秀的摄影师总是准备充分的！”他诚恳地说，“朋友们，我们生活在一个充满不确定性的时代。你永远不知道拐角处可能有什么！”

"If you ask me, I think he just wants to film the monkeys having sex!" Touji said in a stage whisper to Shinji, causing them both to laugh out loud at the other boy's discomfort.

“要我说，我觉得他就是想拍猴子交配！”东治对真嗣小声说道，两人因另一名男孩的不自在而放声大笑。

"Philistines!" Aida muttered as he finally put the camera back in his satchel, his face a light shade of pink, before he too allowed himself a chuckle at the taller boy's joke.

"庸俗之辈！" 艾达低声嘟囔着，最终将相机放回他的挎包里，脸上泛起淡淡的粉红色，随后他也忍不住对高个子男孩的笑话轻声笑了起来。

"So, Ace." Touji finally spoke after a short silence amongst the boys. "What's the deal with you lately?"

"那么，阿斯。" 在男孩们短暂的沉默后，Touji 终于开口了，"你最近是怎么回事？"

"What do you mean?" Shinji replied puzzled.

"你是什么意思？" 真嗣困惑地回答。

"I mean with you and the Demon." Touji answered. "She's been almost nice to you! What's all that about? Not to mention that you're walking around some kinda weird daze lately. Come on, 'fess up Hotshot! You bein' kept up at night by some Demon love?"

"我是说你和那个恶魔之间的事。" 东治回答道，"她对你几乎算得上友好了！这到底是怎么回事？更别提你最近走路都像在梦游似的。快说吧，高手！是不是夜里被恶魔的爱情缠住了？"

"Touji Suzuhara!" 铃原东治！

The three boy's head swiveled around to see Class Representative Horaki closing the last few feet before standing before them looking at the taller boy disapprovingly. A few paces behind her followed Asuka, her face unreadable as she also surveyed the trio.

三个男孩的头齐刷刷地转向，只见班长堀崎正快步走完最后几英尺，站在他们面前，不满地打量着那个高个子男孩。在她身后几步之遥，明日香也跟了上来，她的表情难以捉摸，同样审视着这三人。

"Hey, Class Rep!" Touji said without missing a beat. "Hey Demon."

"嘿，班长！" 东治毫不犹豫地说道，"嘿，恶魔。"

"Touji!" Hikari said sharply. "Show some respect! Asuka risks her life every time this city comes under attack you know? If it wasn't for her who knows what would happen?"

"偷鸡！"光严厉地说，"要有点尊重！每次这座城市遭受攻击时，明日香都是冒着生命危险的，你知道吗？如果不是她，天知道会发生什么？"

"Yeah, so does Ace here!" Suzuhara replied gesturing towards Shinji. "But you don't see him acting all snooty n' high and mighty about it!"

"是啊，Ace 也是这样！" 铃原回答道，同时指向真嗣，"但你没见他摆出一副自命不凡、高高在上的样子！"

"Asuka does not act snooty…" Hikari began.

"明日香并不摆架子……" 光开始说道。

"Thanks, Hikari." Asuka interrupted, quickly getting into character. "But I don't need you to defend me from this Kansai cretin and his ignorant ramblings!"

"谢谢你，光。" 明日香打断道，迅速进入角色，"但我可不需要你来保护我，免受这个关西蠢货和他那无知言论的侵扰！"

"Asuka…" Shinji began reproachfully. He wanted to enjoy this rare opportunity for them to be away from NERV and on a school excursion without all of the usual angst and arguments. Maybe even, he thought, they could all get along and just enjoy themselves. It didn't seem too much to ask.

"明日香……" 真嗣带着责备的口吻开口了。他本想享受这难得的机会，远离 NERV，在学校的远足中，没有平日的焦虑和争吵。或许，他心想，大家能和睦相处，尽情享受。这样的请求，似乎并不过分。

"Oh Puh-lease Third!" The redhead cut him off. "Though I think that even you could do better than hanging around with Pinky and the Brain here!" she said caustically, gesturing towards Touji and Kensuke. "You're a Pilot for God's sakes! Have some standards!"

“哦，拜托，第三位！”红发女孩打断了他。“尽管我认为，即使是你，也比和这里的粉红脑袋和大脑袋混在一起要好得多！”她尖刻地说道，同时指向了东治和健介。“你可是个驾驶员啊！拜托，有点标准行不行！”

"I suppose you think that you're a better class of companion for him?" Touji said defensively.

“我猜你认为你更适合做他的伙伴？” 冬二有些防备地说道。

Asuka paused for a second, narrowing her eyes at her classmates. "Maybe I do…" she said thoughtfully.

明日香停顿了一下，眯起眼睛看着她的同学们。“也许我真的……”她若有所思地说。

"What…?" "什么…？"

"I do believe that monkey-boy here has made a very good point!" Asuka said brightly. "Come on Shinji!" She said, holding out her hand to the boy.

"我确实认为这里的猴子男孩提出了一个很好的观点！" 明日香兴奋地说道。"来吧，真嗣！" 她边说边向男孩伸出手。

"Eh?" "嗯？"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"What was that Asuka?" Shinji asked in confusion.

"那是怎么回事，明日香？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"Come on Shinji." Asuka repeated. "Before that publicly employed anorak over there notices us!"

"快点，真嗣。"明日香重复道，"别让那边那个穿制服的家伙注意到我们！"

The Third Child looked around at his friends nervously before sighing to himself and getting up from where he had been sitting.

三孩环顾四周，紧张地看着他的朋友们，然后暗自叹了口气，从坐着的地方站了起来。

"That-a-boy Shinji!" The redhead said with a grin. Shinji looked in confusion down at her hand, which was still held out towards him. "Come on Baka!" Asuka said impatiently. "I don't have cooties!" Tentatively he held his hand out, which the German girl grabbed and immediately began to drag him physically along with her and away from her baffled classmates.

"真有你的，真嗣！"红发女孩笑着说。真嗣困惑地低头看向她伸出的手。"快点，笨蛋！"明日香不耐烦地说，"我又没有虱子！"他犹豫地伸出手，德国女孩一把抓住，立刻开始拽着他，与她那些困惑的同学渐行渐远。

"Bye Hikari! See ya later, Losers!" She called out as the two pilots quickly vanished into the throng of students and visitors milling around the Zoo's entrance gate.

"再见，光！回头见，失败者们！" 她大声喊道，随后两位飞行员迅速消失在动物园入口处熙熙攘攘的学生和游客群中。

The three remaining teenagers stood open mouthed and staring at the space that their two departed friends had occupied. Finally Hikari managed to find her voice and speak.

剩下的三个少年目瞪口呆地凝视着两位离去的朋友曾占据的空间。最终，光设法找回了自己的声音，开口说话。

"W-What just happened?" She said.

"刚刚发生了什么？" 她说。

"So what flavour have you got, Shinji?" Asuka asked as he joined her at the bench seat just outside of the reptile house.

"那么，你有什么口味的，真嗣？" 当他在爬行动物馆外的长椅上加入她时，明日香问道。

"Uh… green tea." The boy answered as he handed her the other cone.

"呃……绿茶味的。" 男孩回答着，同时递给她另一个冰淇淋筒。

The redhead wrinkled up her nose at him. "Seriously? Green tea? Is that even a real flavour?"

红发女子朝他皱了皱鼻子，“真的吗？绿茶味？那算是真正的口味吗？”

"Uh… I-I… Yeah, actually, it is."

呃……我……是的，实际上，确实是这样。

"You Japanese are weird." Asuka observed. "What kind of people would make green tea flavoured ice-cream? You've probably got some kind of weird jelly-fish flavour too!"

“你们日本人真奇怪。”明日香评论道，“什么样的人会做出抹茶味的冰淇淋呢？你们大概还有某种奇怪的海蜇味冰淇淋吧！”

"I don't think so." The boy answered with a mock-serious frown. "Although that's not such a bad idea… "

"我不这么认为。" 男孩带着装出来的严肃皱眉回答道，"虽然这主意也不算太糟……"

"Are you serious? What kind of…" Asuka paused as she saw the smile on Shinji's face. "Fine! Mock the beautiful foreigner! What ever happened to that famous Japanese politeness and hospitality?" She waved her own ice cream cone for emphasis.

"你认真的吗？这是什么……" 明日香停顿了一下，因为她看到真嗣脸上的笑容。"好吧！嘲笑美丽的异国人吧！那著名的日本礼貌和好客精神去哪了？" 她挥动着自己手中的冰淇淋筒以示强调。

"Sorry."

"Bah! I've told you I hate it when you do that, Shinji!"

"哼！我已经告诉过你，我讨厌你那样做，真嗣！"

"Uh… Sorr-okay Asuka." 呃…抱歉-好吧，明日香。

The redhead smiled at him and ruffled his hair gently with her free hand. "That's okay baka-Shinji! I know that it's some kind of weird compulsion with you! Just try to curb it a little! You don't have to be sorry for everything you know. Or do you have delusions of grandeur and importance that you're not telling me about?"

红发女孩朝他微笑着，用空闲的手轻轻揉乱了他的头发。“没事的，笨蛋真嗣！我知道你这是某种奇怪的强迫症！试着控制一下吧！你不需要为所有事情道歉，明白吗？还是说，你有关于自己伟大和重要的幻想没告诉我？”

Shinji blushed at the contact. "I-I don't think so." He answered in confusion.

真嗣在接触的瞬间脸红了。“我，我不这么认为。”他困惑地回答道。

The German girl nodded. "Good, keep it that way! You know, my father, while he may not have been the best parental role model in the world, did often say one thing to me which kinda stuck." Asuka said. "He used to say to me; "You know Asuka, not everything is your fault, you're not that important!""

德国女孩点了点头。“好，保持这样！你知道，我父亲，虽然他可能不是世界上最好的父母榜样，但他经常对我说一句话，这句话有点儿让我记住了。”明日香说。“他过去常对我说：‘你知道的，明日香，不是所有事都是你的错，你没那么重要！’”

"Um, that seems a little harsh."

呃，这似乎有点严厉了。

"Yeah, perhaps, but I've come to realise he was actually right." Asuka answered. "Of course, that doesn't mean he wasn't a also self centred lying asshole, but I've learned to live with that."

"是啊，或许吧，但我现在意识到他其实是对的。" 明日香回答道，"当然，这并不意味着他不是个自私自利的骗子混蛋，但我已经学会与之共处了。"

"Hmmm…" The Third Child was obviously thinking of his own relationship with his Father.

"嗯……" 第三子显然在思考他与父亲之间的关系。

Asuka looked at his gentle face as his brow furrowed in thought. 'Ah crap' She thought. 'This little diversion to try and get closer to him is not really turning into the happy date I was planning!' She decided to steer things in a more positive direction.

明日香看着他那因思考而皱起的眉头，温和的面庞。'啊，糟糕'，她心想，'这次试图接近他的小小插曲并没有变成我计划中的愉快约会！'她决定将事情引向更积极的方向。

"Thanks for the ice cream Shinji!" Asuka said with a genuine smile.

"谢谢你的冰淇淋，真嗣！" 明日香带着真诚的笑容说道。

"Huh? Oh… yeah. You're welcome."

嗯？哦……对。不客气。

"You wanna try some?" She asked him, proffering her partially licked cone towards him. "It's my favourite flavour! You can't usually even get liquorice ripple ice cream in Japan, it's the best!"

"你想尝尝吗？" 她问他，将她那部分舔过的冰淇淋递向他。"这是我最喜欢的口味！在日本通常连甘草波纹冰淇淋都买不到，这个最棒了！"

Shinji looked apprehensively at the grey and white confection. Delicately he tasted at the edge of the cone. Immediately he screwed up his face at the strong flavour.

真嗣忐忑不安地看着那灰白相间的甜品。他小心翼翼地舔了舔蛋卷边缘。随即，他被那浓烈的味道弄得皱起了脸。

"Hmph, what would you know anyway?" Asuka huffed at his reaction.

"哼，你又能知道什么？" 明日香对他的反应嗤之以鼻。

"Sorr…" He began to say before immediately trying to suck back the word. The consequence of which meant that he started choking and spluttering as he inhaled ice cream. His face turned bright red and tears streamed down his face as Asuka began pounding vigorously on his back. Eventually he settled and his face slowly began to return to it's normal shade. Asuka grabbed a paper napkin and dabbed at his streaming eyes with it.

"对不起…" 他刚开口，又立刻试图收回这个词。结果，他开始呛咳和喷溅，因为他在吸入冰淇淋。他的脸变得通红，泪水顺着脸颊流下，而明日香则用力地拍打着他的背。最终他平静下来，脸色也慢慢恢复了正常。明日香抓起一张纸巾，轻轻地为他擦拭着流下的泪水。

"Though I suppose that it could be an acquired taste!" She said now more gently patting his back with her left hand. Then, quite deliberately, She licked her own ice cream, letting him see that she took from the same spot that he had tried.

"虽然我想这可能是后天养成的口味！" 她此刻更温柔地用左手轻拍他的背。然后，她故意地舔了舔自己的冰淇淋，让他看到她是从他尝试过的同一点舔起的。

Both of them returned to a companionable silence as the finished their respective cones.

他们各自吃完冰淇淋后，又回到了一种友好的沉默中。

Asuka saw in the distance several shorter figures surrounding a taller one with a clipboard apparently leading them. "Come on Shinji. While we're here we might as well explore this alleged zoo!" She said urgently grabbing Shinji's hand and almost dragging him off the bench, she wanted to avoid the rest of their class for as long as she possibly could.

明日香在远处看到几个较矮的身影围绕着一个拿着写字夹板的高个子，显然是领头的。"快点，真嗣。既然我们来了，不妨探索一下这个所谓的动物园！"她急切地说着，抓住真嗣的手，几乎把他从长椅上拖起来，她想尽可能长时间地避开班上的其他人。

Skirting around the brick hexagon that was Tokyo-3 Zoo's reptile house the children passed by a small pen containing some meerkats and another holding several warthogs and eventually stopped in front of one that housed a couple of dusty zebras in an optimistically named 'Savannah' enclosure.

孩子们绕过东京-3 动物园爬行动物馆的砖砌六边形建筑，经过一个小围栏，里面有几只狐獴，另一个围栏里则有几头疣猪，最终停在一个名为“萨瓦纳”的围栏前，里面住着一对满身尘土的斑马。

"Man, this is the worst zoo that I've ever seen!" Asuka exclaimed. "And I've been to Schweinfurt!"

"天哪，这是我见过的最糟糕的动物园了！" 明日香惊叹道，"而且我还去过施韦因富特呢！"

"I've never been to a zoo before." Shinji said quietly.

"我以前从没去过动物园。" 真嗣轻声说道。

"Seriously?" Asuka said turning towards him incredulously. "How could you never have been to a zoo before? Everyone's been to a god-damn zoo Shinji! Have you been living under a freaking rock your whole life?"

"真的假的？" 明日香难以置信地转向他，"你怎么可能从没去过动物园？每个人都去过动物园啊，真嗣！你这辈子是住在哪个石头缝里了吗？"

"I…uh… no." The boy answered awkwardly. "I-It's just that my teacher, he… he said that he didn't like wasting money supporting a bunch of animals when there were people starving in the Caucasus."

"我…呃…不是的。"男孩尴尬地回答，"只是因为我的老师，他…他说不喜欢浪费钱去支持一群动物，而高加索地区还有人饿着肚子。"

"Geez, he sounds like a complete tool." Asuka said dismissively. Almost immediately she felt bad for teasing the poor boy. She had almost forgotten the loveless sterility of his upbringing.

"天哪，他听起来就像个十足的工具。" 明日香不屑地说道。几乎立刻，她为取笑那个可怜的男孩感到内疚。她几乎忘记了他在缺乏爱的环境中成长的枯燥无味。

"He was a good man…" Shinji said quietly.

“他是个好人……” 真嗣轻声说道。

"Perhaps," She answered. "But you've gotta admit that he didn't really do crap for you, did he?"

“或许吧，”她回答道，“但你得承认，他其实没为你做什么，不是吗？”

"I guess not.." He answered glumly, before a thought struck him. "How do you know that?"

"我想不是吧……" 他沮丧地回答，突然一个念头闪过。"你怎么知道的？"

"Uh.. you told me yourself, back during synchronisation training, remember?" Asuka answered quickly.

"呃...你自己在同步训练时告诉我的，记得吗？" 明日香迅速回答道。

"Umm…" "呃…"

"You probably don't remember because that stupid leotard was cutting off the circulation to your brain at the time." Asuka continued with a grin.

"你可能不记得了，因为当时那件愚蠢的紧身衣正勒得你大脑供血不足。" 明日香笑着继续说道。

"Um…yeah… it was a bit tight!" Shinji replied with a faint blush.

"呃……是啊……有点紧！" 真嗣回答时脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。

"A bit tight!" Asuka said teasingly. "Any tighter and I would have been able to see you change your mind!"

"有点紧哦！" 明日香打趣道，"再紧一点，我就能看到你改变主意了！"

"Huh? What does that mean?" Shinji asked in confusion.

"嗯？那是什么意思？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"Haha… I just mean… Ummmm… You know something? I'm not really sure!" Asuka said squeezing his hand tightly in hers and smiling at him. "Let's get out of here, Shinji! I don't like the way that those zebras are eyeing us off!"

"哈哈…我的意思是…嗯…你知道吗？我也不太确定！" 明日香说着，紧紧握住他的手，朝他微笑。"我们离开这里吧，真嗣！我不喜欢那些斑马盯着我们的样子！"

She went to walk further along the path that led deeper into the zoo compound, but before she had got even three step she was brought up short by Shinji's hand pulling her back gently.

她本想沿着那条通往动物园更深处的小径继续前行，但还没走出三步，就被真嗣轻柔地拉住手，停了下来。

She turned back to face him and was surprised to see his face was a fetching shade of red and his eyes kept meeting hers and darting away.

她转过身来面对他，惊讶地发现他的脸颊泛着迷人的红晕，而他的目光不断与她相遇又迅速移开。

"What's wrong, Shinji?" She said in confusion.

"怎么了，真嗣？" 她困惑地说。

"A-Asuka… " He stammered. "I-I uh… I… can I ask you something?"

"飞鸟……" 他结巴着说，"我……我，呃……我可以问你件事吗？"

Asuka tilted her head in puzzlement at him. "Yeah, of course you can!" She said. "What's bothering you?"

明日香困惑地歪着头看向他。“嗯，当然可以！”她说，“你有什么烦心事吗？”

"Y-You promise that you won't be angry with me?"

"你保证不会生我的气吗？"

The red head frowned at him. "Shinji." She said in a serious tone. "How long have we known each other?"

红发女子皱眉看着他，"真嗣，"她语气严肃地说，"我们认识多久了？"

"Uh.. umm.. about eight months or so, I guess."

呃.. 嗯.. 大概八个月左右吧，我想。

"Really?" Asuka said with a small smile. "It feels longer somehow!"

"真的吗？" 明日香带着一丝微笑说道，"感觉上似乎更久了呢！"

"I-I suppose…" Shinji replied uncertainly, sweat forming on his brow.

"我...我想应该是吧…" 真嗣不确定地回答道，额头渗出了汗珠。

"So, Shinji, in that eight months, have I ever given you the slightest impression that I'm ever going to be able to keep a promise that I'm not going to get angry at you?"

那么，真嗣，在那八个月里，我是否曾给你留下过哪怕一丝一毫的印象，让你觉得我能够遵守一个承诺，即我不会对你发火？

"Erm, no…" Shinji replied with a gulp.

“呃，不…” 真嗣吞了口口水回答道。

"So then." Asuka continued, brushing the hair back from her face with her free hand. "With that in mind, what did you want to ask me?"

“那么，”明日香继续说道，用她空着的手将脸上的头发拨开，“考虑到这一点，你想问我什么？”

"W-Well… Asuka…" The boy stammered.

"呃…那个…明日香…" 男孩结结巴巴地说。

"Oh for heaven's sake Shinji! Will you stop stammering and blushing like an idiot and spit it out!"

哦，看在上天的份上，真嗣！你能别像个傻瓜一样结巴和脸红，快说出来吗！

"Why are you being nice to me?" The brown haired boy blurted out.

"你为什么对我这么好？" 棕发男孩脱口而出。

"Nice?" Asuka repeated in confusion. "I just called you an idiot! How exactly is that being nice?"

"Nice?" 明日香困惑地重复道，"我刚说你是傻瓜！这怎么就成友好了？"

"Apart from that." Shinji continued before his courage could fail him. "You've been a lot nicer to me lately. Not just uh… you know… sleeping in my room… but you haven't really yelled at me for a couple of weeks and you've been kinder to me since you had that… incident... at school."

除此之外，真嗣继续说道，就在他的勇气可能消失之前。"你最近对我好多了。不仅仅是……你知道的……在我房间睡觉……而且你已经好几个星期没有对我大吼大叫了，自从你在学校发生了那件事之后，你对我更温柔了。"

"Yes?" Asuka asked, encouraging Shinji to continue.

"怎么了？" 明日香问道，鼓励着真嗣继续说下去。

"A-At first I thought I was because maybe you hit your head or something, but then I thought…"

"So." Asuka interrupted. "You're not only saying that I was horrible to you in the past, but that because I'm nice to you now, I must have brain damage or something?"

“所以，”明日香打断道，“你不仅是在说我过去对你很糟糕，而且因为现在我对你好了，我就一定是脑子坏了或者怎么了？”

"I… umm.. oh.." Shinji said as her words hit him. "No. Th-that's not what I meant… I was just saying that.."

"我…呃…哦…" 真嗣在她的话语冲击下结巴着说，"不，那不是我的意思…我只是想说…"

"I'm glad Shinji." Asuka said softly. "I'm so happy that you don't think that I'd only ever be nice to you because of an acquired brain injury!"

"我很高兴，真嗣。"明日香轻声说道，"我真开心，你不会认为我对你好只是因为后天脑部受伤！"

"O-Of course not!" Shinji stammered.

"当、当然不是！" 真嗣结巴地说。

"That's very comforting." The German girl replied dryly.

“那真是令人感到安慰。”德国女孩干巴巴地回答道。

"Um… yeah." Shinji continued floundering slightly. "It's not that you weren't nice to me before that, it's just that you're different from before I guess."

嗯… 对。" 真嗣继续有些语无伦次地说，"并不是说你之前对我不好，只是你和以前不一样了，我想。"

Asuka sighed. "You're wrong, of course, baka-Shinji. I wasn't mean to you before then." She said gently.

明日香叹了口气。“你当然错了，笨蛋真嗣。在那之前我并没有对你刻薄。”她温和地说道。

"Yeah, I know.. " The boy began, defeated.

"是啊，我知道……" 男孩开口道，带着挫败感。

"I was a complete self-centred bitch!"

我曾是个彻头彻尾的自私贱人！

"Huh?" Shinji was completely shocked by her words.

"啊？" 真嗣被她的话彻底震惊了。

Asuka now took both of Shinji's hands in hers and stood close to him. "This isn't easy for me Shinji, even after all… all I've been through." Shinji saw in shock that her eyes glistened with moisture. "I-I was awful to you before… before I changed. I treated you as a doormat and tormented you just to boost my own crappy ego."

明日香此刻紧紧握住真嗣的双手，与他站得很近。“真嗣，这对我不容易，即使经历了那么多……”真嗣震惊地发现她的眼眸中闪烁着湿润。“我……我以前对你很糟糕……在我改变之前。我把你当作踏脚石，折磨你只是为了抬高我那卑微的自尊。”

"That's not true Asuka!"

“那不是真的，明日香！”

"You know that it is, you're just doing what you always do. Keeping the peace. Trying to please everyone, even me!" The redhead sniffed and stepped closer to the boy. "Well, I think that it's about time that you stopped, Shinji Ikari!"

你知道这是怎么回事，你只是在重复你一贯的做法。维持和平。试图取悦所有人，甚至包括我！”红发女孩吸了吸鼻子，向男孩走近了一步。“好吧，我认为是时候你停止这样做了，碇真嗣！”

"But…" 但是…

"I don't expect you to understand," Asuka interrupted. "But I've seen the death of everything that I ever cared about, the destruction of my entire world, just because I was too proud to do anything about it. Because I've been too proud to reach out to the one human being on this Godforsaken rock that showed me kindness, not because I was a pilot, not because I was smart, not even because he was too dense to know any better. The one person who kept me sane when I had nothing else to live for. I'm damned if I'm gonna let him down again!"

"我不指望你能理解，"明日香打断道，"但我亲眼目睹了我所珍视的一切的消亡，我的整个世界被摧毁，只因我过于骄傲而不愿采取任何行动。因为我一直太骄傲，不愿向这个被神遗弃的星球上唯一对我展现善意的人伸出援手，不是因为我是个飞行员，不是因为我聪明，甚至不是因为他太迟钝而不知如何是好。这个人是在我一无所有、失去生存意义时让我保持理智的人。如果我再让他失望，那我真是罪该万死了！"

Shinji looked strangely crestfallen. "Mr Kaji?"

真嗣看起来异常沮丧。“加持先生？”

Despite the moisture beginning to spill from her eyes, Asuka face-palmed and let out an exaggerated groan of frustration. "No, not Kaji!" She said in an exasperated voice. "You, you idiot!"

尽管泪水开始从她的眼中溢出，明日香还是捂住了脸，发出了一声夸张的沮丧呻吟。“不，不是加持先生！”她用恼怒的声音说道，“你，你这个笨蛋！”

"Buh…wha?" The brown haired boy said. "M-Me?"

"呃…什么？" 棕发男孩说道，"我？"

"Yes, you, baka!" 是的，就是你，笨蛋！

"B-But… why?" "可…可是…为什么？"

Asuka held Shinji's hand tightly. Her face, much to his surprise, was blushing beet red.

明日香紧紧握住真嗣的手。令他惊讶的是，她的脸颊涨得通红。

"Because, hard as you find it to believe, I like you, Shinji Ikari!"

"因为，尽管你可能难以置信，我喜欢你，碇真嗣！"

"Like…?" “就像……？”

"Yeah, you know… Like?" She replied.

是啊，你知道的…像什么？她回答道。

"You? Like me?" 你？喜欢我？

"Yeah… Or do you think that I kiss and sneak into the bedrooms of just anyone?" Asuka said with a dangerously raised eyebrow and a strange sense of déjà vu.

"是啊…还是你觉得我会随便亲吻并潜入任何人的卧室？" 明日香说着，危险地挑起一边眉毛，同时感到一种奇怪的似曾相识。

"Oh…" "哦…"

"That's right." The redhead said, before continuing more nervously. "So… how do you feel about that?"

"没错。"红发女子说道，随后略显紧张地继续问："那么……对此你有什么感受呢？"

A moments awkward silence seemed to envelope the entire zoo compound.

片刻的尴尬沉默似乎笼罩了整个动物园区域。

"I-I like you too, Asuka!" Shinji said in a nervous rush.

"我、我也喜欢你，明日香！" 真嗣紧张而急促地说道。

She breathed a massive sigh of relief as what she felt must be an enormous foolish grin spread across her face. "Hallelujah! I thought that we'd never get there!"

她深深地松了一口气，感觉到自己脸上一定挂着一个巨大的傻笑。“哈利路亚！我还以为我们永远到不了那里呢！”

Shinji smiled back at her, a giddy thrill of elation making it feel like all of the hair on the back of his neck was standing on end. He didn't resist as Asuka pulled him forward into a tight embrace. He was aware of the smell of her shampoo and the soft crinkling sounds of her starchy school uniform and the warmth of her beneath it, as their bodies pressed together.

真嗣对她回以微笑，一股难以抑制的喜悦让他感觉后颈的每一根毛发都竖立起来。他没有抗拒，任由明日香拉着他向前，紧紧相拥。他能闻到她洗发水的香味，听到她那浆硬的校服发出的轻微沙沙声，感受到她身体下的温暖，两人的身体紧紧贴合在一起。

After all too short a time he felt her pull away from their embrace slightly and he became aware of her face close to his own. Her warm breath tickling his skin. Gently she leaned forward and kissed him, their lips touching for a few short exhilarating seconds before she pulled back again and stared at him from mere centimetres away.

经过短暂得令人遗憾的时光，他感觉到她略微从拥抱中抽离，意识到她的脸庞近在咫尺。她温暖的呼吸轻拂着他的肌肤。她温柔地倾身向前，吻了他，双唇相触，短短几秒令人振奋，随后她再次后退，从仅几厘米的距离凝视着他。

"There, was that better than the first time?" Asuka asked him gently.

"那里，这次是不是比第一次好些了？" 明日香温柔地问他。

"Yeah…" "嗯…"

"Good." She said with a blush and a nervous smile. "I bet you didn't think when you woke up this morning that the most beautiful and popular girl in all of Tokyo-3 would be putty in your clammy hands, did you?"

"挺好的。" 她脸颊泛红，带着一丝紧张的微笑说道，"我猜你今早醒来时，肯定没想到东京-3 最美丽、最受欢迎的女孩会如此轻易地落入你那汗津津的手中，对吧？"

"I-I guess not." “我-我想不是。”

"You see now that the Great Asuka Langley Soryu can be nice!"

现在你看到了，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷也可以很友好！

"Yeah. You think that maybe it might snow tomorrow?" Shinji asked playfully.

"是啊，你觉得明天可能会下雪吗？" 真嗣俏皮地问道。

"Settle down, Shinji-kun!" Asuka admonished with a grin. "Try not to spoil this tender moment by being an ass."

"冷静点，真嗣君！"明日香笑着提醒道，"别因为你的不懂事而破坏了这温馨的一刻。"

"Sorry, Asuka." 对不起，明日香。

"Hmph." Asuka replied, sticking her nose faux-haughtily in the air. "This time I'll take that, seeing as you do need to apologise for making fun of my kindness to you!"

"哼。" 明日香回答道，故作傲慢地把鼻子翘向空中，"这次我就接受了，毕竟你确实需要为取笑我对你的好意而道歉！"

Shinji smiled at her superior pose and tone, feeling for the first time, safe in Asuka's company. "Asuka." He asked.

真嗣对着她那上级般的姿态和语气微笑，第一次感到在明日香的陪伴下感到安全。“明日香。”他问道。

"Yeah?" "是吗？"

"C-Could we maybe… you know… kiss again?" The boy stammered, his cheeks bright at his own boldness.

"我们能不能……呃……再亲一次？" 男孩结结巴巴地说，脸颊因自己的大胆而泛起红晕。

Shinji gulped audibly as Asuka's smile grew positively predatory. "Ooooh! Aren't we the brave little Shinji-kun now?" She said, the thrill of the moment making her almost giddy. "Come on then Shinji, take me in your scrawny arms!"

当明日香的笑容变得极具掠食性时，真嗣不由自主地咽了口唾沫。"哦！我们的小真嗣现在变得勇敢了吗？"她说道，那一刻的兴奋让她几乎飘飘然。"来吧，真嗣，用你那瘦弱的手臂抱住我！"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Asuka wrapped her own arms back around the Third Child. "Pucker up!" She said closing the gap between their faces.

明日香将自己的手臂环绕回第三适格者的身上。“撅起嘴来！”她说着，拉近了彼此脸庞的距离。

This time they kissed for a little longer, both of them taking in the scent and warmth of the other. For a few short seconds Asuka Langley Soryu forgot all of the horrors of Third Impact and the weight of her past and just lost herself in a moment of happiness that she had not experienced in her whole life.

这一次，他们的吻持续了稍长一些，两人都在感受着对方的气息与温暖。在短短几秒钟内，惣流·明日香·兰格雷忘却了第三次冲击的所有恐怖，以及她过去的沉重负担，全身心沉浸在她一生中从未有过的幸福瞬间。

Their lips separated and Asuka giggled at the distant look on Shinji's face. "Not bad, Third." She whispered, causing his dark blue eyes to focus on her sapphire blues. "A bit more practice and I think that we could make a habit of this!"

他们的嘴唇分开后，明日香看到真嗣那遥远的表情，不禁咯咯笑了起来。“还不错，第三名。”她轻声说道，让他的深蓝色眼睛聚焦在她那蓝宝石般的双眸上。“再练练，我觉得我们可以养成这个习惯！”

His own face lit up with a lopsided grin. "I-I think that would be nice, Asuka." He said in a whisper.

他自己的脸上绽放出一个歪斜的笑容。“我，我觉得那样会很好，明日香。”他低声说道。

"I hope that it will be a lot more than 'nice', Shinji-kun!" Asuka said leaning in closer to him again.

"我希望它远不止是'不错'，真嗣君！" 明日香说着，再次向他靠近。

"Yeah… " 是啊…

"Oh. My. GOD!" 哦，我的天哪！

They both jumped apart as if they had been shocked at the ear splitting squeal that accompanied that exclamation. The two pilots turned in unison to see the figure of Hikari, followed closely by Touji and Kensuke, making a beeline for their current location.

两人被那声震耳欲聋的尖叫吓得跳开，仿佛触电一般。两位飞行员齐刷刷地转过身，只见光急匆匆地朝他们现在的位置直奔而来，后面紧跟着东治和健介。

"Ah, crap." Asuka muttered, grabbing hold of Shinji's hand in hers and giving it a squeeze. "The cavalry arrives!"

"啊，糟糕。" 明日香低声说着，紧紧抓住真嗣的手，用力握了一下。"援军到了！"

"I knew! I knew it!" Hikari kept repeating excitedly. "Didn't I say that I knew it?" She said over her shoulder to a less ecstatic looking pair of boys. "I just knew it!" The pig-tailed girl said with a nod to herself.

"我就知道！我就知道！"光兴奋地重复着。"我不是说过我知道吗？"她回头对两个看起来不那么激动的男孩说。"我就是知道！"这位扎着马尾辫的女孩自言自语地点了点头。

"Hi Hikari," Asuka said, trying to act cool. "Hi stooges."

"嗨，光，"明日香试图装酷地说，"嗨，傻瓜们。"

"Ohmygodohmygodohmygod!" Hikari repeated as she came running up and crash tackled Asuka in a bear hug. The red head grunted as most of the air was forced out of her lungs at the impact.

"天啊天啊天啊！" 光一边重复着，一边跑过来给明日香来了个熊抱式的冲撞。红发女孩被撞得闷哼一声，大部分空气在冲击下从肺里挤了出来。

"Geez, settle down Hikari!" Asuka said as she got her breath back.

"哎呀，光，冷静点！" 阿苏卡喘过气来后说道。

Sadly for the redhead Hikari was in no mood to calm down. Quickly and expertly she pulled the redhead away from the boys. "So Tell me everything, Asuka! What did he say? What did you say? Did he give you his love confession?"

遗憾的是，红发的 Hikari 此刻并没有平静下来的心情。她迅速而熟练地将红发女孩从男孩们身边拉开。“那么告诉我一切，Asuka！他说了什么？你说了什么？他向你表白了吗？”

"I…" Asuka tried to answer.

"And don't try that whole "There's nothing in it." Line either!" Hikari interrupted before the German girl could get more than a syllable out. "I saw it all! You and Shinji were kissing! In school uniform too, that's so scandalous!"

"别来那套'什么都没有'的说辞了！" 光在德国女孩还没说出第二个音节前就打断了她。"我全都看见了！你和真嗣在接吻！还穿着校服，真是太不检点了！"

"Hikari…" Asuka attempted to speak again, growing impatient with her friend's prattling.

"光…" 明日香试图再次开口，对她朋友喋喋不休的闲聊感到不耐烦。

"But it's so cute! And Shinji's such a catch too, I mean he's the only male Eva pilot, and he's really sweet and considerate…"

但它太可爱了！而且真嗣也是个不可多得的好对象，我是说，他是唯一的男性 Eva 驾驶员，而且他真的很体贴周到……

"Hikari." 光。

"But the two of you live in the same apartment, that could be considered a little risqué by some… not me of course, I know you better than that, but still…"

但你们俩住在同一间公寓，这在某些人看来可能有点大胆……当然，我不是这么看，我对你了解得更多，但即便如此……

"Hikari!" Asuka almost shouted in exasperation, finally getting the other girl's attention.

"光！" 明日香几乎恼怒地喊道，终于引起了另一个女孩的注意。

"Yes Asuka?" "怎么了，明日香？"

"Will you stop babbling for one second and listen to me!"

你能停一秒钟别唠叨，听我说吗！

"Sure Asuka, of course!" Hikari answered, finally focusing her attention on her friend.

"当然，明日香，当然可以！" 光回答道，终于将注意力集中到了她的朋友身上。

"Good!" The redhead with barely contained relief. "Fine, I will admit that I kissed Shinji, and… h-he kissed me."

"太好了！"红发女孩带着难以掩饰的释然说道，"好吧，我承认我吻了真嗣，而且……他吻了我。"

"Ooh, that's so romantic!" Hikari began, before falling silent again as Asuka held up her hand.

"哦，真是太浪漫了！" 光开始说道，但随后又沉默了，因为明日香举起了她的手。

"And… We've admitted that we like each other… but that's it! So don't go turning this into something out of those sappy romance novels that you read, okay?"

而且……我们已经承认了彼此喜欢对方……仅此而已！所以别把这变成你读的那些煽情言情小说里的情节，好吗？

"But…" Hikari started. "Okay Asuka, but you have to give me something here! I mean you and Shinji… How did this happen?"

“但是…”光开始说道，“好吧，明日香，但你得给我点什么！我是说你和真嗣…这是怎么发生的？”

"If I told you, you would never believe me!" Asuka said with a smile.

"如果我告诉你，你绝对不会相信我的！" 明日香笑着说。

"Why wouldn't I?" 我为什么不呢？

"Just trust me on this Hikari." Asuka said. "Now let's go and save Shinji from the clutches of those to two nerf-herders!"

"就信我这一次，光。" 明日香说道，"现在我们去把真嗣从那两个笨蛋手里救出来吧！"

"Two what-whats?" "两个什么什么？"

"Never mind!" Asuka said waving her hand with a laugh as she walked over to where Shinji was vainly trying to defend himself from the avalanche of disapprobation being directed at him by the other two boys.

"没关系！" 明日香笑着挥手说道，她走向真嗣所在的地方，他正徒劳地试图从另外两个男孩对他倾泻的责难洪流中保护自己。

"…with the demon?" Touji was saying in full rant against the 'betrayal' of male kind that Shinji had committed by becoming close to Asuka. "You know that she'll just treat you like dirt and scrape you off her shoe as soon as she gets tired of you!"

“……跟那个恶魔？”东治正激烈地抨击真嗣与明日香亲近这一对男性同胞的“背叛”行为。“你知道的，她一旦对你厌倦了，就会把你当垃圾一样对待，然后像擦掉鞋上的污垢一样甩掉你！”

"Ahem." “嗯哼。”

Touji and Kensuke spun around to face the two irate girls, leaving Shinji looking downcast behind them. Both boys quailed slightly beneath the combined gazes of Asuka and Hikari, before Touji stood forward again and faced the German teen with defiance in his eyes. He swallowed loudly, but said nothing.

冬二和剑介转身面对两位愤怒的女孩，留下真嗣在他们身后显得沮丧。两个男孩在明日香和光联合的目光下略显畏缩，随后冬二再次挺身而出，用挑衅的眼神直面德国少女。他大声吞咽了一下，但什么也没说。

"What's the matter, Suzuhara?" Asuka said facing him with her hands on her hips. "Scared that now that Shinji's taken that you'll lose your boyfriend Aida as well?"

"怎么了，铃原？"明日香双手叉腰面对着他，"是担心现在真嗣被占了，你也会失去你的男朋友相田吗？"

"You think you're so much better than us, demon girl!" Touji answered angrily. "Well… Shinji's too good a person to be treated like crap by you! You'll just use him like you always do and then toss him aside like so much garbage"

"你以为你比我们高贵多少吗，恶魔女孩！" 东治愤怒地回答道，"哼……真嗣是个太好的人，不该被你这样糟蹋！你只会像往常一样利用他，然后像对待垃圾一样把他抛弃。"

"Touji…" Hikari began sternly.

"投掷…" 光严肃地开始说道。

"What would you know, bone head?" Asuka interrupted, incensed at the track suited boy's accusations. "You two, you sit in your safe little lives, using Shinji just so that you can perv at Misato and feel like big men by hanging out with an Eva pilot, while we risk our lives for your worthless asses. You haven't lived our lives, you don't know a fucking thing about who I am and what I've been through! Yet somehow you think that you have the right to fucking judge me?" The redhead snarled, causing Touji and Kensuke to unconsciously both take a step backwards. "You know what? I'm sick of your holier than thou attitude, Arschlöcher! Why don't you get the fuck out of my face and leave the grown ups to look after ourselves! "

"你懂个屁，蠢货？" 明日香打断道，对那个穿着运动服的男孩的指责感到愤怒。"你们俩，坐在你们安逸的小日子里，利用真嗣只是为了偷窥美里，感觉自己跟个 EVA 驾驶员混在一起就了不起了，而我们却为了你们这些无用的家伙冒生命危险。你们没经历过我们的生活，根本不了解我是谁，我经历了什么！可你们却自以为有权评判我？" 红发女孩咆哮着，让东治和健介不由自主地后退了一步。"告诉你，我受够了你们这种自以为是的嘴脸，混蛋！你们为什么不滚开，让成年人自己照顾自己！"

"Asuka.." Hikari was horrified at how things were getting out of hand.

"明日香……" 光被事态失控的严重性吓到了。

"Go to Hell, demon-girl!" Touji resorted to Asuka, enraged. "I don't need your permission to…"

"下地狱去吧，恶魔女孩！" 东治转向明日香，愤怒地说道，"我不需要你的允许来……"

"Stop it, please!" Shinji suddenly yelled out, causing both parties to fall silent. "Asuka… Touji and Kensuke are my friends. They're only worried about me. Th-They don't know you like I do! Please, can you try to get along with them? For me?"

停下吧，求你了！" 真嗣突然大声喊道，让双方都陷入了沉默。"明日香… 东治和健介是我的朋友。他们只是担心我。他们不像我这样了解你！拜托，你能试着和他们相处吗？为了我？

All of the anger drained out of Asuka's being. She had never heard Shinji actually speak to her like this. She could see that this was important to him. Important enough to risk her anger and possibly endanger the relationship that had just begun to bloom between them. She couldn't help but feel a deep seated sense of respect for him in doing that, even though she was more than a little miffed at the sense of having to give in that she felt in acquiescing to his request. Lilith may have accused her of being too proud, and she knew that the Angel had been reasonably accurate in her summation, but it was still hard for her to back away from a fight. Somewhat painfully she finally managed to swallow her pride.

明日香心中的怒火瞬间消散。她从未听过真嗣这样对她说话。她看得出这对他很重要。重要到足以冒着激怒她的风险，甚至可能危及他们刚刚开始萌芽的关系。尽管她对不得不屈服于他的请求感到有些恼火，但她还是忍不住对他这样做产生了一种深深的敬意。莉莉丝或许会指责她过于骄傲，她也知道天使的评价相当准确，但要她从一场争执中退让仍然很难。她有些痛苦地最终还是咽下了自己的骄傲。

"Sure, Shinji." She answered gently, facing the the wide eyed boy. "I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let them get to me like that."

"当然，真嗣。" 她温柔地回答，面对着那个睁大眼睛的男孩。"我...我很抱歉。我不应该让他们那样影响到我。"

"Thank you Asuka." 谢谢你，明日香。

Hikari and the other two boys who were just staring in disbelief at Asuka's words.

光和另外两个男孩只是难以置信地盯着阿苏卡的话。

"Touji, Kensuke." Shinji continued. "I-I like Asuka… Please don't try to ruin this for me! I've never had anything like this happen to me…ever! If you could put up with this, for our friendship's sake, it would mean a lot to me…"

"东治，健介。" 真嗣继续说道，"我...我喜欢明日香…请不要试图破坏这件事！我从未经历过这样的事情…从来没有！如果你能为了我们的友谊忍受这一点，对我来说意义重大…"

"O-Okay." Both boys answered, moved by the young pilot's plea.

"好的。"两个男孩回答道，被年轻飞行员的恳求所打动。

"Thank you!" Shinji said with a smile.

"谢谢你！" 真嗣微笑着说。

"Well said Shinji!" Hikari said beaming.

"说得好，真嗣！" 光笑着说。

Suzuhara stepped forward, towards the German girl. "Truce." He said simply, holding out his hand.

铃原上前一步，走向那位德国女孩。“休战。”他简单地说道，伸出了手。

Asuka looked at the proffered hand suspiciously for a second, like it was faintly offensive smelling, before reaching out and taking it in her own and shaking it. "Truce."

明日香狐疑地盯着那伸出的手看了一秒，仿佛它散发着微妙的冒犯气味，随后才伸出手握住并摇了摇。“休战。”

"Kensuke." Hikari said, startling the shorter boy who had been hanging back for most of the altercation. He stepped forward and also shook Asuka's hand, noting that the redhead seemed to smile as she squeezed his hand in a surprisingly strong grip that left his own throbbing for nearly twenty minutes afterwards.

"健介。" 光说，这句话让一直躲在后面的大部分争执中都没怎么出声的矮个子男孩吓了一跳。他走上前，也握了握明日香的手，注意到这位红发女孩似乎在微笑，她那出乎意料的强有力握手让他的手在之后近二十分钟里都隐隐作痛。

"Truce." 停战。

"Thank you." Shinji said. An awkward silence fell over the group.

"谢谢。" 真嗣说道。一阵尴尬的沉默笼罩了整个团队。

"Well…" Asuka spoke eventually. "What do we do now?"

“嗯……”明日香最终开口了，“我们现在怎么办？”

Almost as if in answer to her question the sound of the other students from the school and the voice of the guide could suddenly be heard surprisingly close by.

仿佛是对她问题的回应，学校里其他学生的声音和导游的声音突然出乎意料地近在咫尺。

"Damn it!" Kensuke said. "They've caught up with us!"

"该死！" 健介说道，"他们追上来了！"

"Maybe we can join up with them again and the guide won't notice?" Hikari said uncertainly.

"或许我们还能再跟他们会合，而向导不会察觉到？" 光不确定地说道。

"Are you nuts?" Asuka said. "There's no way on Earth that I'm spending the rest of the day following Captain Comb-over around this place! Let's get out of here!"

"你疯了吗？"明日香说道，"我绝不可能把这一天剩下的时间都用来跟着那个梳头队长在这儿转悠！我们快离开这里吧！"

The other children all agreed with her, so Hikari gave in and they all quickly left the enclosure and its disinterested zebras and headed deeper into the zoo complex.

其他孩子都同意她的看法，于是光也妥协了，他们迅速离开了那个无动于衷的斑马围栏，向动物园更深处进发。

The other three teens didn't fail to notice that Shinji and Asuka didn't let go of each others hands the whole time.

另外三个少年没有忽略，整个过程中，真嗣和明日香始终没有放开彼此的手。

Eventually, of course, the five teenagers did end up being overtaken by the rest of their classmates. Even Asuka admitted that it was inevitable that they would have to rejoin at some stage. That didn't stop her grumbling about it though. Completely unnoticed they all slipped back amongst the chattering throng of students just as they milled around a shiny modern building that stood out amongst the more dilapidated exhibits around it.

当然，最终那五位少年还是被其他同学赶超了。就连明日香也承认，他们迟早得重新融入集体。但这并不妨碍她对此发牢骚。他们悄无声息地混入了那群叽叽喳喳的学生中，就在大家围绕着一座闪亮的现代建筑转悠时，这座建筑在周围破败的展品中显得格外突出。

Above the entrance to the building was a sign that proclaimed the large structure as "Tokyo 03 Municipal Zoological Gardens Palingenozoology Department" What really piqued the children's interest was the small fig leaf symbol in the corner of the sign. This was confirmed by their guide who began extolling the greatness of NERV that was funding this important research into restoring the damage inflicted in the planet's ecosystem since Second Impact.

建筑入口上方悬挂着一块标牌，上面写着这座宏伟建筑是“东京 03 市立动物园再生动物学部”。真正引起孩子们兴趣的是标牌角落里的小无花果叶符号。这一点得到了他们的导游的证实，他开始赞扬资助这项重要研究、致力于修复自第二次冲击以来对地球生态系统造成的损害的 NERV 组织的伟大。

Inside the building they were shown several laboratories where behind glass white suited scientists hunched over test tubes and microscopes. They were told of the pioneering work done here by the world's top scientists, with the generous financial and technical help of NERV, to use recent advances in bio-engineering technology to resurrect some of the world's lost species of animals.

在大楼内，他们参观了几个实验室，透过玻璃可以看到身着白色实验服的科学家们正俯身于试管和显微镜前。他们了解到，在这里，世界顶尖科学家在 NERV 慷慨的财力和技术支持下，利用生物工程技术的最新进展，致力于复活一些已灭绝的动物物种。

Next the children were shown some of the successes of the program to date. Behind yet more glass screens were pens containing the young of several varieties of animal that had not survived the disastrous years following Second Impact. Hikari was particularly taken with the ring tailed lemurs that frolicked and played amongst themselves. While Kensuke was strangely drawn to the three toed sloth cub that stared back out at him from its pen.

接下来，孩子们被展示了一些该计划迄今为止的成功案例。在更多的玻璃屏幕后面，是圈养着几种在第二次冲击后的灾难年份未能存活下来的动物幼崽的围栏。光特别喜欢那些在彼此间嬉戏玩耍的环尾狐猴。而健介则莫名被那只从围栏中回望他的三趾树懒幼崽所吸引。

Down the next corridor was a section where examples animals that had been extinct for longer periods that had been successfully brought back were kept.

下一个走廊的尽头是一个区域，那里保存着一些已经灭绝较长时间但成功复活的动物样本。

Kensuke was wrapped up in filming the Thylacine, even though the animal in question was doing nothing more than scratching itself and yawning hugely in its simulated habitat. While Shinji was far too interested for Touji's understanding in some boring pigeon from America that had been extinct in the wild since the early twentieth century.

健介全神贯注地拍摄着袋狼，尽管这只动物只是在模拟栖息地里挠痒和打哈欠。与此同时，真嗣对一只自 20 世纪初就在野外灭绝的美国无聊鸽子表现出了过分浓厚的兴趣，这让东治难以理解。

Seeing Hikari apparently listening keenly to their guide, Touji looked around for something more interesting than a bunch of dead animals that somehow weren't dead anymore. He saw with some surprise that Asuka was on her own, away from the other children, staring fixedly in front of one of the pens further along the walkway. He was going to leave her well enough alone, but something about the way she was standing held his attention.

看到光似乎正聚精会神地听着导游的讲解，冬二四处张望，寻找比那些不知为何又活过来的死动物更有趣的东西。他有些惊讶地发现，明日香独自一人，远离其他孩子，站在走道更远处的一个围栏前，目不转睛地凝视着。他本打算不去打扰她，但她站立的姿势却吸引了他的注意。

The track suited boy shook his head. Even though he would respect their newly declared truce, he still was uncomfortable with the red haired girl being so close with his friend. He still felt the need to set some ground rules to ensure that she wouldn't abuse the good faith in which he had called it.

那个穿着运动服的男孩摇了摇头。尽管他会尊重他们新宣布的休战，但他仍然对红发女孩与他的朋友如此亲近感到不适。他仍然觉得有必要设定一些基本规则，以确保她不会滥用他基于善意所达成的休战。

"Yo, Red!" He called out as he approached the lone girl.

"哟，红！" 他走近那独自一人的女孩时喊道。

To his annoyance she didn't even seem to hear him, she appeared completely wrapped up in looking at the small grey dog like creatures that were running around in the pen in front of her. A small plaque next to the enclosure read.

令他懊恼的是，她似乎根本没听见他的话，完全沉浸在观察面前围栏里奔跑的小灰狗似的生物上。围栏旁的一块小牌子上写着。

'Ezo Okami: Canis Lupus Hattai, {Also known as Ezo Wolf or Hokkaido Wolf}. Date of extinction: Late 19th Century, Hokkaido, Japan.'

虾夷狼：犬属哈塔伊，{又称虾夷狼或北海道狼}。灭绝时间：19 世纪末，日本北海道。

"Wolf?" Touji said. "I didn't think that there were any wolves in Japan!"

"狼？" 东治说道，"我没想到日本还有狼！"

"There weren't." Asuka replied in a harsh voice. "Not for over a hundred years… "

"确实没有。"明日香用严厉的声音回答道，"已经超过一百年没有了……"

Touji looked at the redhead with surprise. Her voice sounded so… weird to him. Like she was trying not to cry or something unthinkable like that. He looked at her. "You okay, Red?"

透二惊讶地看着那个红发女孩。她的声音在他听来……很奇怪。仿佛她在努力忍住不哭，或是类似难以想象的事情。他注视着她，问道：“你还好吗，红发？”

She turned to face him, he was shocked to see tears threatening to spill from her bright blue eyes. "I hate this place!" She said with unexpected vehemence. "This is all wrong! How can they be so arrogant? So fucking stupid? What's dead should stay dead!"

她转过身面对他，他震惊地发现她那明亮的蓝眼睛里泪水即将溢出。“我讨厌这个地方！”她出乎意料地激烈说道，“这一切都错了！他们怎么能如此傲慢？如此愚蠢至极？死了的东西就应该保持死亡！”

"Calm down…" Touji said feeling lost. This was the last thing he ever expected to see from the proud and fiery German. "It's just a bunch of boring animals. What do you care if some stupid dead pigeon or wolf is cooked up in some geek's test-tube?"

"冷静点……" 图吉感到困惑地说道。这是他从未预料到会从那位骄傲而热情的德国人那里看到的反应。"不过是一群无聊的动物罢了。你何必在意某个蠢笨的死鸽子或狼是否被某个怪咖在试管里烹饪呢？"

Asuka turned back around and pointed at the young wolf cubs that were gamboling around their enclosure. The tip of her finger turned white where it pressed on the glass and it seemed to Touji that she was pointing at one young cub in particular. This one, though the largest of the young creatures, seemed to have a significantly shorter tail than its litter mates.

明日香转过身来，指着在围栏里嬉戏的小狼崽们。她的指尖紧贴着玻璃，变得苍白，而在冬二看来，她似乎特别指向了其中一只小狼崽。尽管这只小狼崽是这群小家伙中最大的，但它的尾巴明显比它的同胞们短得多。

"This is just wrong." Asuka said more quietly. Touji was shocked by the apparent pain in her voice.

“这太不对了。”明日香更加轻声地说道。东治被她声音中明显的痛苦震惊了。

The tall boy swallowed uncomfortably. This was getting weird and awkward. He was starting to feel sorry for the clearly upset girl. A part of him rebelled against this unfamiliar feeling. Not to mention the reason that he was actually here to make sure that Asuka understood the ground rules of their new truce. Touji cleared his throat to speak.

高个子男孩不自在地咽了咽口水。情况变得越来越奇怪和尴尬。他开始为那个明显心烦意乱的女孩感到抱歉。他内心的一部分抗拒着这种陌生的感觉。更不用说，他来这里的真正原因是为了确保明日香明白他们新休战的基本规则。东二清了清嗓子，准备开口。

"So, Red…" He began. There was still just too much history between him and the Pilot of Unit 02 for him to be able to use her name comfortably.

“那么，Red……”他开口道。他和二号机驾驶员之间仍有太多过往，让他难以自在地直呼其名。

"What do you want, stooge?" Asuka answered him harshly. She wasn't feeling in the mood for his clumsy grandstanding. More than anything she wanted to go and find Shinji again. Have him hold her and ease the wave of anxiety that had overcome her at seeing her old foes from life after Impact. It was too much of a coincidence. Asuka was annoyed with herself for letting the tall boy see her moment of weakness, but she had been too struck by seeing the young wolf cubs in that were in the enclosure. She couldn't believe that not only were the creatures that had haunted her nightmares since her return right there in front of her. What really shook her was the fact that it appeared that NERV itself was responsible for their very existence!

"你想干嘛，跟班？" 明日香毫不客气地回应他。她此刻没心情看他笨拙的炫耀。她最想做的就是再次找到真嗣，让他拥抱自己，缓解因看到冲击后生活中那些旧敌而涌起的焦虑。这太巧合了。明日香对自己让那个高个子男孩看到自己脆弱的一刻感到恼火，但她实在是被围栏里的小狼崽们震惊到了。她难以置信，那些自她归来后一直萦绕在噩梦中的生物，竟然就在眼前。真正让她震惊的是，似乎 NERV 本身就与这些生物的存在有关！

Oblivious to this Touji continued. "Yeah… Well…" He was naturally uncomfortable around a girl in obvious distress. Even one who had been his avowed enemy until under an hour ago. "I…I just wanna make sure that you and Shinji are gonna be… You know… You're not gonna treat him like garbage anymore! 'Cos if I see you so much as make the poor kid look sad, then we are done! Okay?"

对此浑然不觉的东治继续说道：“是啊……嗯……”他自然对一个明显处于困境中的女孩感到不自在，即使这个女孩在不到一小时前还是他公开的敌人。“我……我只是想确认你和真嗣会……你知道的……你不会再把他当垃圾对待了！因为如果我看到你让那可怜的孩子看起来难过，那我们就完了！明白吗？”

"Fine! I already agreed to all of that, stooge! What else do you want?"

"好！我已经同意了所有那些，小喽啰！你还想要什么？"

"Huh?" Was his only reply. He was expecting more fight from the notoriously fiery girl. "I just don't want him hurt is all!"

"啊？" 他只是这么回应道。他本以为这个出了名火爆的女孩会有更激烈的反抗。"我只是不想他受伤而已！"

"Good, neither do I!" Asuka replied testily. "If it would make you happy, you can punch me in the face if I hurt him!"

"好，我也不想！" 明日香不耐烦地回答，"如果这能让你高兴，要是我伤害了他，你可以打我的脸！"

"I don't hit girls."

我不打女生。

"No, of course not. You only hit poor traumatised kids that you've never met before!" Asuka answered him pointedly.

"不，当然不是。你只会打那些你从未见过、已经受到创伤的可怜孩子！" 明日香尖锐地回答他。

"Hey! That's not fair!" Touji complained. "I only hit Shinji that time 'cos I was angry that my sister got hurt in the battle! Anyway, Shinji and me settled it honourably, like men."

"嘿！这不公平！" 东治抱怨道，"我那次打真嗣只是因为我妹妹在战斗中受伤了，我很生气！不管怎样，我和真嗣已经像男人一样体面地解决了这件事。"

To Touji's surprise the redheaded girl smiled at him, before wiping her eyes on the sleeve of her blouse. "Look, Touji." She said earnestly. "I don't really care if you believe me or not. I care about Shinji. Sure, he's a hopeless case, but I want him to be happy more than anything else right now!"

令冬二惊讶的是，红发女孩对他微笑了一下，然后用衬衫袖子擦了擦眼睛。“听着，冬二。”她诚恳地说，“我不在乎你是否相信我。我在乎的是真嗣。没错，他是个无可救药的案例，但此刻我比什么都希望他能幸福！”

"Y-You do?" "你真的吗？"

"Of course I do! What kind of selfish bitch do you think that I am?" Asuka asked. "Hmm…maybe don't answer that!" She said with a wry smile.

"我当然会！你以为我是哪种自私的贱人？" 明日香问道。"嗯……还是别回答这个问题了！" 她苦笑着说。

"Okay then…" The boy said, feeling relieved that it was so easy. "Th-Thanks… I guess."

"那好吧……"男孩说道，感到松了一口气，原来这么简单。"谢……谢谢吧，我想。"

Asuka's eyes softened. "You've been a good friend to him Touji. You know that he has suffered a lot because of the Evas."

明日香的目光柔和了下来。“你一直是他的好朋友，东治。你知道他因为 EVA 受了很多苦。”

"Yeah, I know." 是的，我知道。

"So it's meant lot to Shinji to have you looking out for him." Strangely, to Touji, she looked sadly at him. "Just promise me one thing. Don't go doing anything stupid, stooge. It would hurt him more than you know if you something bad happened to you."

所以，有你关照真嗣对他来说意义重大。" 奇怪的是，当她对东治说这话时，眼神中带着一丝悲伤。"只求你答应我一件事。别做任何蠢事，傻瓜。如果你出了什么事，对他的伤害会比你想象的还要深。"

"What do you mean?"

你是什么意思？

Asuka looked nervously around her before saying more softly. "No matter what they offer you, nothing is worth getting hurt or killed for… What would happen to your sister then?" She asked.

明日香紧张地环顾四周，然后轻声说道：“无论他们给你什么，都不值得为此受伤或丧命……那样的话，你妹妹怎么办？”她问道。

The tall boy just looked at her in confusion. "My sister? What has this got to do with her?"

高个子男孩困惑地看着她。“我妹妹？这和她有什么关系？”

"If a blonde scientist comes to school and offers you a deal that seems too good to be true… It probably is." She broke off as she saw the other three students heading towards them. "Just trust me on this…" She whispered to him before turning to face the others as they approached.

如果一位金发科学家来到学校，向你提出一个好得难以置信的交易……那很可能确实如此。"她话音未落，便看到另外三名学生正朝他们走来。"在这件事上，你得相信我……"她在他耳边低语，随即转身面对逐渐接近的其他人。

"Shinji-kun! Where have you been all this time?" Asuka called out loudly, making a bee-line towards Shinji and fussing over him. Touji watched with mixed emotions as the young pilot blushed at the attention being showered on him by the brash redhead.

"真嗣君！这段时间你都去哪儿了？"明日香大声喊着，直奔真嗣而去，关切地围着他转。当这位年轻的驾驶员因为那位大胆的红发女孩的宠爱而脸红时，东治带着复杂的情绪在一旁观看。

"What were you two talking about, Touji?" The jock turned from the scene in front of him to see the pretty face of the Class Representative looking up at him quizzically. "I hope that you weren't being mean to Asuka! You two did promise to be nice to each other!"

"你们俩在聊什么呢，冬二？" 体育健将转过身来，看到班长那张漂亮的脸正疑惑地抬头望着他。"希望你没有对明日香不友好！你们俩可是承诺过要友好相处的！"

"Uh.. we were just talking is all…" Touji replied to the pig-tailed girl. Not really that sure of what had actually just passed between himself and the girl who had been his sworn enemy so recently.

"呃...我们只是在聊天而已…" 东二回答那位扎着马尾辫的女孩。他其实并不确定刚才自己与不久前还是死对头的女孩之间究竟发生了什么。

"Really?" Hikari seemed incredulous.

"真的吗？" 光似乎难以置信。

"Yeah." Touji said. "You know," He continued, nodding towards the two pilots who were now openly holding hands as they walked amongst the exhibits. "I-I think that they're gonna be okay…"

"嗯。" 东治说道，"你知道的，" 他继续说着，向那两位飞行员点头示意，他们现在正手牵手走在展品之间，"我觉得他们会没事的……"

"That's great Touji!" Hikari was ecstatic at his words. "I told you that Asuka was a good person! I think that she and Shinji will be so good together!"

"太棒了，冬二！" 光听到他的话非常兴奋。"我早就说过明日香是个好人！我觉得她和真嗣在一起会很合适！"

The track suited boy was silent at this. He was still too troubled by the redhead's warnings to think straight.

那个穿着运动服的男孩此时沉默了。红发女孩的警告让他心烦意乱，难以冷静思考。

Eventually the silence between them was broken by the guide telling all of them to move out through the main exit through to the car park. In ones and twos the students trickled out of the door into the sunshine outside. Kensuke, video camera still in hand, rejoined them and the five teenagers also headed for the exit.

最终，他们之间的沉默被导游打破，导游告诉所有人从主出口出去，前往停车场。学生们三三两两地从门口鱼贯而出，走进外面的阳光下。手握摄像机的健介也重新加入了他们，五个少年也一同向出口走去。

Asuka and Shinji were still holding hands as they walked across the car park to the waiting bus. Quickly the two pilots once again split off from the rest of their friends and made their way off to the far side of the lot so that they could have some time together away from the others.

明日香和真嗣手牵手穿过停车场走向等候的巴士。很快，两位驾驶员再次与朋友们分开，向停车场的远端走去，以便他们能有一些远离他人的独处时光。

"Remember what I said, stooge! Don't do it!" Asuka called back over her shoulder as they walked off.

"记住我说的，跟班！别那么做！" 他们离开时，明日香回头喊道。

"What did she mean by that?" Hikari said to him in confusion.

"她那话是什么意思？" 光困惑地向他问道。

"Yeah, what's going on between you two?" Kensuke asked his friend.

"是啊，你们俩之间怎么了？" 健介问他的朋友。

"I really don't know." Touji answered. Though a strange sense of foreboding bothered him.

"我真的不知道。" 冬二回答道，尽管一种莫名的预感困扰着他。

High up in Geo-stationary orbit above the North American continent a NERV satellite picked up a massive energy spike in the Nevada desert far below. Within seconds a bright light, so powerful that it temporarily overloaded the sensitive imaging sensors contained in the satellite's camera array, flared from the planet's surface and left the instruments temporarily blinded to the disaster below.

在北美大陆上方的高地球同步轨道上，NERV 的一颗卫星捕捉到了内华达沙漠深处巨大的能量波动。几秒之内，一道强烈的光芒从地球表面爆发出来，其强度之大，竟短暂地使卫星相机阵列中的敏感成像传感器过载，导致仪器暂时无法观测到下方发生的灾难。

When the cameras were finally recalibrated and able to once again view the stricken area, all that was visible to the viewers was an enormous and angry red glow spreading across the desert with a bright core of roiling yellow death at its centre.

当摄像机最终重新校准，再次能够观察受灾区域时，观众们所能看到的，只是一片巨大而愤怒的红色光芒，在沙漠中蔓延，其中心是一团翻滚的黄色死亡之光，明亮夺目。

In the his office at the heart of the pyramid within the Geofront, Gendo Ikari closed down the video feed from the satellite.

在位于 Geofront 内部金字塔中心地带的办公室里，源渡关闭了来自卫星的视频传输。

There were only three inhabitants of this cavernous space. The Supreme Commander of NERV sat at his desk, which was bare except for the small video screen which was slowly lowering into the highly polished wooden surface. To the left side of the same desk sat the Sub Commander. The old professor's hand rubbed his chin slowly as he pondered the ramifications of what he had just seen.

这个空旷的空间里仅有三位居民。NERV 的最高指挥官坐在他的桌前，桌上除了缓缓降入抛光木面的小型视频屏幕外别无他物。同一桌子的左侧坐着副指挥官。老教授的手缓缓摩挲着下巴，深思着他刚刚目睹的后果。

Sitting virtually unregarded at the other side of the desk, Rei Ayanami watched the subtle interplay between the two older men without comment.

坐在桌子另一侧几乎无人注意的绫波丽，默默观察着两位年长男子之间的微妙互动，未发一言。

"It would seem that the Third Branch were keen to test the new S2 engine ahead of schedule." Gendo Ikari remarked calmly to his deputy.

“看来第三分部急于提前测试新的 S2 引擎。”源堂元帅平静地对他的副手说道。

"Foolishness." Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki remarked sadly. "1297 lives lost in the name of pride. For what gain?"

“愚蠢至极。”副司令冬月悲伤地评论道，“为了虚荣，牺牲了 1297 条生命。究竟得到了什么？”

"Had they succeeded, Professor, our scenario would have been gravely compromised."

教授，如果他们成功了，我们的计划将受到严重威胁。

"Now they have been caught and had their fingers burnt, suddenly they have the gall to insist that we take Unit 03 off their hands!"

现在他们被逮个正着，吃了亏，居然还有脸突然要求我们接手 03 号单位！

"Yes. It seems that their appetite for playing God has been sated. Unit 03 and its core profile are being airlifted to Matsushiro base as we speak."

是的。看来他们扮演上帝的欲望已经得到了满足。就在此刻，03 号单位及其核心资料正被空运至松代基地。

"Already?" The old man asked incredulously. "We don't have the resources to operate a fourth Evangelion!"

"已经？" 老人难以置信地问道，"我们没有资源来运作第四台福音战士了！"

"The UN has already made the necessary adjustments to our budget."

联合国已经对我们的预算做出了必要的调整。

"So," Fuyutsuki said after a long pause. "The scrolls would appear to indicate that the Apostate is going to emerge soon. Now, it seems, it's form is being forced upon us by our so called friends."

“那么，”冬月在长时间的停顿后说道，“卷轴似乎表明叛教者即将出现。现在看来，它的形态正被我们所谓的盟友强加于我们。”

Before Gendo could answer his former Sensei the grey phone on his desk shrilled into life. Fuyutsuki knew that this phone in particular was the line that linked the specially picked Section 2 operatives that watched the three Pilots directly to the Commander. No matter what other issues were occupying Gendo Ikari, he would always interrupt them for the rare occasions that this particular phone rang.

在源渡能回答他以前的导师之前，桌上的灰色电话突然响起。冬月知道，这部电话是专门用来连接特别挑选的第二科特工，他们直接监视着三位驾驶员，并与指挥官联络。无论源渡·伊卡里正在处理什么其他事务，他总会为这部电话罕见的响铃而中断。

"Yes." Gendo said into the phone. The commander listened for twenty seconds to the muted voice on the other end of the line. "Very well." He continued. "No. Merely observe as before." He hung up the phone.

"是的。" 源渡对着电话说道。指挥官聆听了二十秒，电话那头传来微弱的声音。"很好。" 他接着说，"不，继续像以前一样观察。" 他挂断了电话。

"Trouble?" Fuyutsuki asked after a short silence.

"麻烦？" 冬月在短暂的沉默后问道。

"Perhaps." The Commander replied finally. "It would appear that my son and the Second Child have become close."

"或许吧。"指挥官最终回答道，"看来我的儿子和第二个孩子已经变得很亲近了。"

"Shinji and Kyoko's girl?" The old professor said in surprise. "That shouldn't be possible. Her profile suggests deep seated narcissism and an inability to form close relationships."

"真嗣和恭子的女儿？"老教授惊讶地说，"这不可能。她的资料显示出根深蒂固的自恋倾向和无法建立亲密关系的特点。"

"Indeed, and yet Section 2 confirm an apparent growth in the bond between the two pilots."

确实，然而第二部分证实了两名飞行员之间纽带的明显增强。

"You don't seem surprised." The old man queried.

"你似乎并不感到惊讶。" 老人询问道。

"Hmm." Gendo. "Her aberrant behaviour has increased recently. This latest development is in keeping with that trend."

嗯。" 源堂说，"她最近的行为越来越异常。这一最新进展与那个趋势是一致的。

"Do you think that she could endanger the scenario? She's just a fourteen year old girl. The scrolls after all make little mention of the Second's role."

你认为她会危及这个局面吗？她毕竟只是一个十四岁的女孩。那些卷轴对第二者的角色提及甚少。

"No." Gendo said with an air of finality. "She is unimportant in the Grand Scheme. She will soon tire of the Third and the scenario will remain unaltered."

"不。" 源渡以一种不容置疑的口吻说道，"她在宏伟蓝图中无足轻重。她很快就会对第三适格者感到厌倦，剧情将保持不变。"

"Can you be sure?"

你能确定吗？

The Commander tented his hands in front of his face to hide his smirk. "Professor, you always were the voice of reason and caution. I believe recent developments may indeed have provided a solution to both issues."

指挥官将双手搭在面前，以掩饰他的窃笑。“教授，您向来是理性和谨慎的代表。我相信最近的事态发展或许确实为这两个问题提供了解决方案。”

Rei looked on as the Sub Commander looked quizzically at his superior. "You mean?" He said with what Rei could only feel was a certain amount of horror in his voice.

丽看着副指挥官疑惑地望向他的上级。“您的意思是？”他说道，而丽只能感觉到他的声音中带着某种程度的惊恐。

"Yes." Gendo answered before picking up a different phone. He waited a few seconds before speaking. "Assemble all Class One personnel in Central Dogma in one hour."

"是的。" 源渡回答后拿起另一部电话。他等待了几秒钟才开口："一小时内，召集所有一级人员到中央教条集合。"

Gendo stood up from his desk and walked toward the nondescript door in the shadows of the office that led to his private rooms. "Rei." He said curtly. The blue haired girl wordlessly stood and followed him through the door.

源渡从办公桌前站起身，走向办公室阴影中那扇不起眼的门，那扇门通向他的私人房间。“绫波。”他简短地说道。蓝发少女默不作声地起身，跟随他穿过了那扇门。

Fuyutsuki himself stood up more slowly, his old bones protesting at the movement. He hoped, as he did more and more often in recent times, that the Scenario would go according to the plan that he, Yui and Gendo had first begun orchestrating back in 2003. 'Otherwise,' he mused to himself, 'I'm sure that there will be plenty of room in Hell for all of us for what we've done.'

冬月本人缓缓站起身，年迈的骨骼对这动作发出抗议。他希望，正如最近越来越频繁的那样，情况能按照他和唯、源渡在 2003 年最初策划的那样发展。“否则，”他暗自思忖，“我确信，鉴于我们所做的一切，地狱里定会有我们所有人的位置。”

End Chapter 10 第十章结束

A/N: I've kinda been having my own personal angst-fest about this chapter. It contains elements that are essential for future plot development, and yet actually covers quite a short amount of time with an awful lot of creaky dialogue and exposition! I am probably more nervous about putting this one out than anything I've written in the past!

作者的话：关于这一章，我其实一直在经历个人的焦虑期。它包含了未来情节发展所必需的元素，但实际上只涵盖了很短的时间，充斥着大量生硬的对白和叙述！我可能比以往任何时候都更紧张于发布这一章！

But anyhoo... enough of my whining!

但不管怎样……我的牢骚就发到这里吧！

I hope that you enjoyed. I plan to have Chapter 11 out in a much shorter time-frame, so see you all then!

希望你们喜欢。我计划在更短的时间内发布第 11 章，届时再见！

Cheers! 干杯！

## Chapter 11: The Unforgiving Minute

无法宽恕的瞬间

Hi again! Donderkind here again!

嗨，又见面了！这里是 Donderkind！

Welcome to Chapter 11 of Unbroken.

欢迎来到《永不屈服》第十一章。

Massive thanks to DarknessIncumbent for much encouragement, inspiration, and especially for Beta-reading this chapter. A task, I'm sure, that would have broken many a lesser individual! Thank you, my friend. May your Yebisu never run dry!

非常感谢 DarknessIncumbent 给予的极大鼓励、灵感，尤其是为本章进行校对。我相信，这项任务足以让许多意志不够坚定的人崩溃！谢谢你，我的朋友。愿你的惠比寿啤酒永不干涸！

The Unforgiving Minute 残酷瞬间

"La journée sera rude." Robert-François Damiens, 28 March 1757.

"这一天会很艰难。" 罗伯特-弗朗索瓦·达米安，1757 年 3 月 28 日。

Misato looked at her long-time friend in surprise. "That's it? That was her only condition?"

碇真嗣惊讶地看着她的老朋友。“就这样？这是她唯一的条件？”

Ritsuko Akagi drew heavily on her cigarette. "Uh huh."

赤木律子深深地吸了一口烟。“嗯哼。”

"And the Commander consented?"

指挥官同意了吗？

"When I put it to him he didn't even consider it for more than a second. He just said 'Agreed'. You know, in that way he does, and that was it."

当我向他提出时，他甚至没有考虑超过一秒钟。他只是说'同意'。你知道的，就像他那样，就这样了。

"I don't get it." 我不明白。

"Mmm," Ritsuko replied. "I've got to admit that it was the last thing I expected."

嗯，" 律子回答道，"我得承认，这是我最没想到的。

The purple haired Major rubbed her face tiredly before reaching out and lifting the mug of murky-looking coffee to her lips and sipping loudly. She grimaced at the flavour before taking another sip and placing the mug back on Ritsuko's desk. "She has been acting weird lately, for her anyway. But this was one thing I never would have suspected. I didn't even think that she liked the boy!"

紫发的少校疲惫地揉了揉脸，然后伸手拿起那杯看起来浑浊的咖啡，大声地啜饮起来。她对味道皱了皱眉，又喝了一口，然后把杯子放回律子的桌上。"她最近的行为确实有些反常，至少对她来说是这样。但我从没想过会是这样。我甚至没想到她会喜欢那个男孩！"

"Do you suppose that she's becoming unstable, or should I say more unstable?" The blonde Doctor said with a thin smile.

"你觉得她是不是越来越不稳定了，或者我应该说更加不稳定了？"金发的医生带着一丝微笑说道。

Misato frowned at her friend. "What's with you Rits? She's a teenage kid with some pretty serious issues. I think that we can both remember what that was like. Though as I also remember, no one was making us pilot giant unstable robots against unholy messengers of Global destruction! Why not cut her some slack? Doesn't this at least show that she's capable of some compassion?"

美里皱着眉头看着她的朋友。"你怎么了，律子？她只是个有严重问题的青少年。我想我们都记得那是什么感觉。不过，我也记得，没有人让我们驾驶巨大的不稳定机器人去对抗全球毁灭的邪恶使者！为什么不给她一点宽容呢？这至少表明她还有些同情心吧？"

"Little Miss Perfect? Compassionate?" Ritsuko said bitterly. "Just because she does one apparently nice thing, don't go trying to tell me that she's turned into Mother Teresa! That girl is only capable of looking after her own needs. This proves nothing. I'm sure that she's got some ulterior motive for this."

小完美小姐？有同情心？" 律子苦涩地说。"就因为她做了一件看似好事，别试图告诉我她变成了特蕾莎修女！那女孩只关心自己的需求。这证明不了什么。我敢肯定她这么做有不可告人的动机。

"You might be my friend, Ritsuko, but that doesn't mean I don't think that you've become bitter and angry lately." Misato said. "I don't like you talking about one of my kids that way."

律子，你可能是我的朋友，但这不代表我认为你最近变得尖酸刻薄。" 美里说。"我不喜欢你这样谈论我的一个孩子。

"Sorry, Momma Bear." Ritsuko replied sarcastically.

"对不起，妈妈。" 律子讽刺地回答道。

"Hmph." 哼。

"So how did she take the news anyway?" Misato asked after a short silence.

"那么她到底是怎么接受这个消息的呢？" 沉默片刻后，葛城美里问道。

"Not how I expected, actually." Ritsuko said. "I swear that when I told her she went genuinely pale. I thought for a second there that she was actually going to puke! You'd think that I'd told her that we were sending her to her death or something. I'd have thought that someone like her would have welcomed the chance to prove herself with this, especially after the disaster over in America. Instead I thought that she was actually going to refuse until the I told her that if she didn't do it then Shinji would. That seemed to really take the wind out of her sails! She just sat there looking pale and didn't speak or ask a single question for over ten minutes. The only thing that she did say eventually was to ask for the transfer of that girl the Infirmary."

实际上，并不像我预料的那样。" 律子说，"我发誓，当我告诉她时，她的脸色真的变得苍白。有那么一瞬间，我以为她真的要吐了！你可能会以为我告诉她我们要送她去死似的。我本以为像她这样的人会欢迎这个证明自己的机会，尤其是在美国的那场灾难之后。相反，我以为她真的会拒绝，直到我告诉她如果她不做，那么真嗣就会去做。这似乎真的让她泄气了！她就那样脸色苍白地坐在那里，十多分钟没有说话，也没有问一个问题。她最终唯一说的话是要求把那个女孩从医务室转过来。

"I don't get it, and it gives me a bad feeling." Misato said with a shiver. "It also seems weird to me that the Commander was so determined to have her do it."

"我不明白，这让我有种不好的预感。" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷颤抖着说，"指挥官如此坚决地要她去做这件事，也让我觉得奇怪。"

"Well," Ritsuko said. "The Marduk Institute have yet to find the Fourth Child, so it makes sense to have her on board for this mission. If something does go wrong, then we don't lose one of our more valuable assets like Shinji or Rei." The blonde doctor spat out the last word.

“嗯，”律子说，“马杜克机关还没找到第四适格者，所以让她参与这次任务是合理的。如果真的出了什么问题，我们也不会失去像真嗣或零这样更有价值的资产。”金发医生在说出最后一个词时带着明显的厌恶。

The Major scowled and put down her mug with a thump. "Don't take this the wrong way Ritsuko, but fuck you!" Misato swore forcefully. "I'll see you at 0800 in Matsushiro, with Asuka!"

少校皱着眉头，砰的一声放下杯子。“别误会，律子，但去你的！” 美里狠狠地咒骂道，“我会在八点钟在松代见到你，还有明日香！”

Dr Akagi watched as her friend stormed out of the cramped office with a bitter smile. "You're just pissed off because deep down you know that I'm right." She said to the empty room. Though she herself was also puzzled as to why Gendo had been so adamant that the Second Child perform this activation. She knew enough to realise that the Fourth was ready to be brought on line in such a case.

赤木博士目送着她的朋友带着苦笑愤然离开狭小的办公室。“你只是因为内心深处知道我是对的而生气。”她对着空荡荡的房间说道。尽管她自己也困惑于为什么源渡如此坚持要让第二适格者执行这次激活。她足够了解情况，意识到在这种情况下第四适格者已经准备好上线了。

She lit yet another cigarette and returned to the data for configuring Unit 03's core for the Second Child.

她点燃了又一支烟，继续为第二适格者的零号机三号核心进行配置工作。

Shinji Ikari couldn't sleep. The confusion and concern that swirled in his mind did not permit him the release of slumber.

碇真嗣无法入睡。他脑海中盘旋的困惑与担忧，不允许他进入梦乡的解脱。

It had all started when Misato and Asuka had come back from NERV about two hours earlier, long after the dinner that he had prepared for the three of them had gone cold and the plates had been carefully shrink-wrapped and placed in the fridge.

一切始于大约两小时前，那时美里和明日香从 NERV 回来，远在那顿他为三人准备的晚餐变凉之后，盘子已被仔细地用保鲜膜包裹好，放进了冰箱。

Finally, after ten pm, the two women of the Katsuragi residence had come through the front door. Misato tiredly announced their arrival with the customary "Tadaima!"

终于，晚上十点过后，葛城家的两位女士从前门回来了。疲惫的葛城用惯常的“我回来了！”宣告了她们的归来。

Before Shinji could respond, Asuka had raced through the apartment and into her bedroom, shutting the door forcefully behind her. Shinji had looked at Misato for some kind of explanation. The Major had just shrugged and headed for the fridge to collect a beer.

在真嗣来得及回应之前，明日香已经冲过公寓，跑进自己的卧室，并用力关上了门。真嗣看向美里，希望能得到一些解释。而这位少校只是耸了耸肩，走向冰箱去拿啤酒。

With a sigh Shinji had taken their meals out of the other fridge, but Misato just shook her head.

叹了口气，真嗣从另一个冰箱里拿出了他们的饭菜，但美里只是摇了摇头。

"Sorry, Kiddo," She said. "We kinda ate at the NERV cafeteria… Well, I ate. Asuka didn't seem very hungry for some reason."

"对不起，小家伙，" 她说，"我们刚在 NERV 食堂吃了点东西……嗯，我吃了。明日香不知为何看起来不太饿。"

"What's wrong, Misato? Why is she so upset?" He asked her forlornly.

"怎么了，Misato？她为什么这么难过？" 他悲伤地问道。

Misato had rubbed her hand tiredly over her face. "I… I really don't know. Maybe it's the bad news from over in Third Branch in America. She did live there for a couple of years before moving to Germany once the construction of Unit 02 was started, so she was bound to have known a couple of the people there."

美里疲惫地用手抹了把脸，说道：“我……我真的不清楚。或许是来自美国第三分部的坏消息。她在搬到德国之前，曾在那里生活过几年，当时二号机的建造工作刚开始，所以她肯定认识那里的一些人。”

"Oh." Said Shinji, feeling somehow ashamed of not knowing that. "Th-That's terrible."

"哦。" 真嗣说道，不知为何感到有些羞愧，因为他不知道这一点。"那-那太糟糕了。"

"Yeah…" Misato said pensively. Shinji began to clear the uneaten dinner away again. "Hey," Misato said more brightly. "Could you pack those in a couple of containers to go? Asuka and I are going to be in Matsushiro tomorrow for the activation test of Unit 03, and the cafeteria over there is a real death trap!"

"嗯……" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷若有所思地说。碇真嗣又开始收拾未吃完的晚餐。"嘿，" 明日香语气更加明快地说，"你能把这些打包到几个容器里带走吗？我和明日香明天要去松代进行 03 号机的启动测试，那边的食堂简直是死亡陷阱！"

"Sure." Shinji replied quickly spooning the meals into two plastic containers. "Will you be gone all day?" He asked a little forlornly.

"当然。" 真嗣迅速地将饭菜舀进两个塑料容器中，"你一整天都不在吗？" 他有些失落地问道。

"Yeah, and probably overnight as well. I've asked Kaji to stay over. Is that okay?"

是啊，可能还要过夜。我已经让加治留宿了。这样可以吗？

"Yeah… that's okay. So, why is Asuka going with you?"

嗯……没关系。那么，为什么明日香要和你一起去呢？

"Silly!" Misato said more brightly. "We can't do an activation test without a pilot!"

"傻瓜！" 碇真嗣更加明快地说道，"没有驾驶员，我们怎么进行启动测试啊！"

"Oh… yeah, I guess not."

哦……是啊，我想不是。

"Though I must say that Asuka doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect." Misato said before reverting to a more teasing tone. "Maybe it's the thought of being away from her lover-boy for a whole night!"

尽管我得说，明日香似乎对这个前景并不太兴奋。" 美里说完后，又恢复了调侃的语气，"或许是因为想到要和她的情郎分开一整夜吧！

"Wha..?" Shinji said with a blush.

"啥...？" 真嗣脸红着说道。

"Come on, I know you two have been getting closer lately!" Misato said teasingly. "Who'd have thought that my quiet little Shinji would win the heart of a fiery European maiden!"

"哎呀，我知道你们俩最近关系越来越近了！" 美里打趣道，"谁能想到我那安静的小真嗣竟然赢得了热情奔放的欧洲少女的芳心呢！"

"Misato, not so loud, she might hear you!" Shinji said in a forced whisper. "I-It's not like that! We… We just decided that we like to… ummm… be with each other… I think." His uncertainty showing through plainly in his voice.

"Misato，别那么大声，她可能会听见的！" 碇真嗣勉强压低声音说道。"我……我们并不是那种关系！我们……我们只是觉得喜欢……嗯……在一起……我想是这样的。" 他的不确定感在声音中表露无遗。

The Major relented a little. With the unusual and tragic events that had come to light in the last few days, she felt that she should cut the boy a little slack. "That's okay, Shinji-kun," she said warmly, "All that I ask is that you don't get her pregnant is all!" She wasn't able to resist one last teasing shot.

少校稍微软化了态度。鉴于最近几天揭露的那些不寻常且悲惨的事件，她觉得应该对这个男孩宽容一些。“没关系，真嗣君，”她温和地说，“我只要求你别让她怀孕就好！”她忍不住最后又调侃了一句。

"Misato!" Shinji hissed in horror, his face a bright red beacon in the small kitchen.

"美里！" 真嗣惊恐地低声说道，他的脸在小厨房里红得像盏明亮的信号灯。

xxxxx 源文本：xxxxxx 翻译文本：

Shinji still squirmed when he remembered the older woman's raucous laughter at her own tasteless joke. Asuka moaned and held him closer in the bed, her pretty sleeping face set with a deep frown.

每当真嗣回想起那位年长女士对自己低俗笑话发出的刺耳笑声时，他仍会感到不安。明日香在床上呻吟着，将他抱得更紧，她那美丽的睡颜上刻着深深的皱眉。

He had been hugely relieved that she had not seemed to be angry with him, that evening at least. When he had finally plucked up the courage to knock on her door she had slid it open almost immediately. Shinji had been shocked at the pale and drawn appearance of the Second Child that had stood before him at the doorway, dressed in her long pink sleeping t-shirt. She had pulled him into her bedroom and down onto the bed, where she had simply clung to him like a limpet.

他大大松了一口气，至少那天晚上她似乎并没有生他的气。当他终于鼓起勇气敲响她的门时，她几乎立刻就打开了门。真嗣站在门口，看到第二适格者苍白憔悴的样子，穿着她那件长长的粉色睡衣，感到非常震惊。她把他拉进卧室，按倒在床上，就像附着在岩石上的帽贝一样紧紧抱住他。

Shinji just lay there, uncomfortable, seeing as he was still dressed in his school uniform. After what felt like an age he could feel her breathing become more relaxed and regular. As stealthily as he could he disentangled himself from her arms and sneaked back out to his own room, the one that they usually shared, and had changed into his own sleeping attire. Just as quietly he had crept back to where Asuka lay and gently climbed back into the bed, the girl's sleep apparently undisturbed by his brief absence.

真嗣就这样躺在那里，感到不适，因为他还穿着校服。仿佛过了许久，他感觉到她的呼吸变得更为放松和规律。他尽可能悄无声息地从她的怀抱中挣脱出来，偷偷溜回他们通常共用的自己的房间，换上了睡衣。同样静悄悄地，他潜回明日香躺着的地方，轻手轻脚地重新爬上床，女孩的睡眠似乎并未因他短暂的离开而受到打扰。

He was so confused. Nothing he could imagine could have had this effect on the bright, invincible Asuka that he thought he knew.

他感到如此困惑。他所想象的一切都无法对那个他自认为了解的、明亮而无敌的明日香产生这样的影响。

As he looked down at her Asuka's eyes opened. Even in the dim light of the bedroom the blueness of them took his breath away. He was also suddenly very aware of how close the redheaded girl's face was to his own.

当他低头看着她时，明日香的眼睛睁开了。即使在卧室昏暗的光线下，那双蓝色的眼睛也让他屏住了呼吸。同时，他突然意识到这位红发女孩的脸离他自己的脸有多近。

"You going to just lie there staring at me all night, Shinji?" She whispered.

"你就打算整晚躺在那儿盯着我看吗，真嗣？" 她轻声说道。

"Um…. No." He replied nervously.

“呃……不。”他紧张地回答道。

"Good." She said with a yawn.

"好的。" 她打着哈欠说道。

"Asuka?" He asked after several minutes silence.

"明日香？" 在几分钟的沉默后，他问道。

"Yes?" "什么事？"

"A-Are you okay?" "你还好吗？"

The girl propped herself up on one elbow and looked at him. "Yeah," she replied sarcastically, "Wonderful. What's not to be okay about?"

女孩单肘撑起身子，看着他。“是啊，”她讽刺地回答，“太棒了。有什么不好的呢？”

"You seem… different… worried or something." Shinji said with a hint of fear in his voice. He still wasn't comfortable talking so directly to the red haired girl.

"你看起来……有些不同……担心还是怎么了。" 真嗣说道，声音中带着一丝恐惧。他仍然不太习惯如此直接地与那位红发女孩交谈。

Asuka had dropped her head, her loose red hair briefly obscuring her pretty face. When she had lifted it again, Shinji was shocked to see that her eyes brimming with tears.

明日香低下了头，她那蓬松的红发短暂地遮住了她美丽的脸庞。当她再次抬起头时，真嗣震惊地看到她的眼中充满了泪水。

"I'm scared, Shinji." She said simply.

"我害怕，真嗣。" 她简单地说道。

"Scared?" Shinji repeated in confusion. "You're not scared of anything, Asuka. You're the bravest person that I know."

"害怕吗？" 真嗣困惑地重复道，"你不会害怕任何事情的，明日香。你是我认识的人中最勇敢的。"

Asuka just let herself give a small, sad smile at the boy. He looked so earnest in the dim light, so caring, so alive. She found it hard to believe he was the same broken boy that she had worked so hard to keep alive back at the old farmhouse in the wilderness. The boy who's happiness had somehow become one of her main reasons for living.

明日香只是对着那个男孩露出了一个微小而悲伤的微笑。在昏暗的光线下，他看起来如此真诚，如此关心，如此充满生机。她难以相信他就是那个她曾在荒野中的旧农舍里，费尽心力维持其生命的破碎男孩。那个男孩的幸福不知怎么地成了她活下去的主要理由之一。

"I'm not brave, Shinji-kun, I'm terrified! Terrified of failing. B-Be strong for me, baka-Shinji..." she said softly, "I don't know how I'm gonna do this."

"我并不勇敢，真嗣君，我害怕极了！害怕失败。为我坚强起来吧，笨蛋真嗣……" 她轻声说道，"我不知道我该怎么做到。"

"I-I don't understand, Asuka." Shinji replied, his face a mask of confusion.

"我...我不明白，明日香。" 真嗣回答道，脸上满是困惑。

Instead of replying, Asuka leaned forward and kissed the boy on the lips, passionately, desperately. Like she was trying to draw strength from his very soul. Clumsily, Shinji returned the kiss, deeply confused and also worried at the same time by the wetness he could feel on the German girl's cheeks.

阿苏卡没有回答，而是倾身向前，热烈而绝望地吻上了男孩的唇，仿佛试图从他的灵魂深处汲取力量。真嗣笨拙地回应着这个吻，内心深感困惑，同时又因感受到德国女孩脸颊上的湿润而担忧。

Finally Asuka broke off the kiss.

最终，明日香结束了这个吻。

"Be strong for me…" She murmured as she snuggled against his chest. He held the girl awkwardly until she finally settled in his arms and her breathing grew more regular and less hitched and ragged. Eventually the boy also found some peace in sleep, even if it was sleep filled with dreams of dark forebodings.

"为我坚强起来……" 她依偎在他胸前低语。他笨拙地抱着女孩，直到她终于在他怀里安顿下来，呼吸变得规律而不再断断续续。最终，男孩也在睡梦中找到了些许安宁，尽管那是充满不祥预感的梦境。

The night inched its way forward to an unwanted dawn.

夜色缓缓前行，迎来了不受欢迎的黎明。

Rei Ayanami was worried, and the unfamiliar sensation was making her feel sick to her stomach.

绫波丽感到担忧，这种陌生的感觉让她感到恶心。

A nameless concern ate at her insides. The blue haired girl was totally unused to such strong feelings and emotions. Initially she was concerned that she was experiencing some form of food poisoning. But the symptoms didn't fit with those that her research told her she should expect from such a condition. Eventually she came to the conclusion that the physical symptoms she was observing in herself were in response to the unfamiliar conflicting worries and urges that were filling her head that morning.

一种无名之忧啃噬着她的内心。这位蓝发女孩完全不习惯如此强烈的情感和情绪。起初，她担心自己可能遭遇了某种食物中毒。但症状与她研究所得的预期不符。最终，她得出结论，自己所感受到的身体症状，是对那天早上充斥脑海的陌生矛盾忧虑和冲动的反应。

The blue haired girl finally lifted her head from her desk and watched as the other students prepared themselves for the school day.

蓝发女孩终于从课桌上抬起头，注视着其他学生为新的一天做准备。

The members of class 2-A had been dwindling gradually to a core of about a dozen or so students, essentially composed of those who's parents had not as yet packed up and left Tokyo-3 for the safer areas of Japan. This day, though, that number was even smaller. Rei looked around curiously to see who was missing.

2-A 班的成员逐渐减少，只剩下大约十几个学生，基本上是那些父母尚未收拾行李离开东京-3 前往日本更安全地区的孩子。然而，这一天，人数更少了。绫波丽好奇地环顾四周，想看看谁缺席了。

The Second Child, of course, was at that moment likely in transit to the test facility at Matsushiro. The activation of Unit 03 was due to take place at approximately 1430 hours that afternoon. So her absence was neither unusual, nor particularly bothersome to Rei.

当然，第二适格者那时很可能正在前往松代试验场的途中。三号机的激活预定于当天下午 14 点 30 分左右进行。因此，她的缺席既不奇怪，也没有特别让绫波感到困扰。

Class Representative Horaki was present and bustling around the classroom, marshalling the remaining pupils and making sure that there was nothing to reflect badly on the students when the bell rang and the old sensei appeared.

班长洞木光在场，忙碌地在教室里穿梭，组织剩下的学生，确保铃声响起，老教师出现时，没有任何事情会反映出学生们的不好。

Pilot Ikari was there. The boy sat at his desk looking tired and worried. She knew of his recent attachment to the Second Child. She supposed that she should disapprove of such a coupling. Certainly the Commander appeared to find the idea of his estranged son bonding with the German teen particularly abhorrent. As for Rei herself, she only felt a small pang of something that she felt unable to quantify as yet as a specific emotion. The First Child had been conditioned all of her short life to eschew personal desires and attachments. She did not desire to take the Second's place in Pilot Ikari's affections, yet somewhere deep in her psyche a primordial need for something… other… lay no longer quite so dormant.

碇真嗣在那里。男孩坐在桌前，显得疲惫而忧虑。她知道他最近与第二适格者关系密切。她认为应该反对这样的结合。显然，司令官似乎特别反感他疏远的儿子与德国少女建立联系。至于绫波丽自己，她只感到一丝难以量化为特定情感的微弱刺痛。作为第一适格者，她从小就被训练要摒弃个人欲望和依恋。她并不想取代第二适格者在碇真嗣心中的位置，但在她内心深处，某种原始的需求……某种不同的东西……已不再那么沉睡。

Indeed, these feelings both towards the Third Child as well as her recent inexplicable urges to interact with Pilot Soryu had been building within her gradually for the last several weeks or more. She did wonder, with the still unfamiliar pang of guilt, if these were the result of her no longer taking her prescribed medications that Dr Akagi was so adamant that she use on a daily basis.

确实，这些对第三适格者以及最近莫名想要与飞行员惣流互动的感觉，在过去几周甚至更长时间里逐渐在她心中积累。她不禁带着仍感陌生的愧疚感疑惑，这些变化是否因为她不再服用赤木博士坚持要她每日服用的处方药物所致。

Rei could not identify exactly when or where the onset of the urge that had seen her flush over a month's supply of the medications down her apartment toilet had come upon her. The desire to be rid of them had been so strong that the girl simply had not the will to refuse it.

玲无法确切地回忆起何时何地，那种驱使她将一个月的药物供应冲进公寓马桶的冲动突然袭来。摆脱这些药物的渴望如此强烈，以至于她根本无力抗拒。

It had come to her as she sat alone in her apartment one evening after walking home from NERV following another routine round of Synch tests. Rei had sat on the side of her bed in the dingy apartment, simply awaiting the regular hour when she would rise, take one of the capsules from the zip-lock bag on the counter, and then swallow it down with a small glass of rusty tasting water.

那晚，她独自坐在公寓里，从 NERV 步行回家后，刚刚完成了一轮例行的同步测试。绫波坐在昏暗公寓的床边，静静等待着平常起身的时间，那时她会从柜台上的密封袋中取出一粒胶囊，然后用一小杯带有铁锈味的水将其吞下。

That evening, the hour had long passed for her to take that nightly capsule. Yet Rei still sat on the side of the iron framed bed. She had stared at the bag of red and white pills on the counter top. Her desire to obey the instructions of Doctor Akagi was still strong. She had never disobeyed such an order in the entirety of her short lifespan. It was the will of Doctor Akagi that she take them. That had been all there was to say about it.

那天晚上，她本该早已服下每晚的那颗胶囊。然而，绫依旧坐在铁架床边。她凝视着台面上那袋红白相间的药丸。遵从赤木医生的指示的渴望依旧强烈。在她短暂的生命中，她从未违背过这样的命令。这是赤木医生的意愿，她应该服用它们。关于这一点，无需多言。

That evening something was different.

那天晚上有些不同寻常。

That evening another will seemed to be imposing itself upon the blue haired girl. A voice, as familiar as her own, yet somehow alien to her psyche, made her feel that the capsules were somehow wrong. That if she continued to take them her purpose would never be fulfilled. 'Doctor Akagi has told me I would die if I cease to take my medication.' She thought in response, trying her best to defy the reasoning of that voice. 'Doctor Akagi does not wish us well,' her own voice answered her in her mind. 'Doctor Akagi hates us. Doctor Akagi desires the Commander for herself. In her eyes, we are an impediment to that desire'.

那天晚上，似乎有另一个意志强加在了蓝发女孩身上。一个声音，熟悉得如同她自己的，却又与她的心灵格格不入，让她觉得那些胶囊有些不对劲。如果她继续服用，她的目的将永远无法实现。'赤木医生告诉我，如果我停止服药，我就会死。'她反驳着想，尽力抗拒那个声音的逻辑。'赤木医生并不希望我们好，'她内心的声音回答她。'赤木医生恨我们。赤木医生想要得到指挥官。在她眼里，我们是实现那个愿望的障碍。'

The voice was compelling yet she had felt a pang of guilt that she had found what it said so attractive. She had become accustomed to this voice, listening to its urgings as they had come upon her from time to time over the last few weeks. It was the same voice that had urged her to seek out the Second Child several times. It was the voice that had slowly seen her view of the Commander and his purpose for her shift in a way that she had yet to fully comprehend. It was her voice. Her will. Or so it seemed. Yet it what it urged her to do often ran counter to the way she had been conditioned to see herself and how she fit in to the world.

那声音充满魅力，然而她却感到一阵内疚，因为它所说的内容竟如此吸引她。她已习惯了这个声音，过去几周里，每当它出现时，她都会聆听它的催促。正是这个声音，多次促使她寻找第二个孩子。也正是这个声音，逐渐改变了她对指挥官及其目的的看法，而她对此尚未完全理解。这是她的声音，她的意志，至少看似如此。然而，它所敦促她做的事情往往与她被灌输的自我认知和她在世界中的定位背道而驰。

Finally, however, Rei had no longer been able to resist the call of obedience. She had risen from the bed. She had padded in bare feet across to the counter and filled a grimy glass with water from the tap. She took one of the capsules from the bag and looked at it in the dim light of the small kitchenette. It looked innocuous enough. A tiny red and white cure for the new and strange uncertainty inside of her. Rei took a small sip of water and placed the capsule in her mouth. The voice was silent. She swallowed. Still the voice was absent from her mind.

最终，绫再也无法抗拒服从的召唤。她从床上起身，赤脚轻步走到柜台前，从水龙头接满一杯浑浊的水。她从袋中取出一粒胶囊，在狭小厨房昏暗的灯光下审视着。它看起来无害至极，一颗小小的红白相间的药丸，似乎能治愈她内心新生的奇异不安。绫轻啜一口水，将胶囊放入口中。那个声音沉默了。她咽下胶囊，那声音依旧未在脑海中响起。

Feeling strangely empty inside she looked again at the zip-lock bag full of pills that Dr. Akagi had given her just days before. Now she saw that they all looked quite different to her than they had mere seconds ago. The red half was leeching into the white side. The pills were all turning a deep crimson hue. The colour of fresh blood. As she picked up the bag and looked at it the pills seemed shift and move within the plastic. The contents of each capsule began rapidly bursting before her eyes and from them seeped a viscous flow of red liquid, like small bloody eruptions that soon filled the bag with thick red fluid with the now empty shells of the capsules floating within it.

她感到内心莫名空虚，再次看向几天前赤木医生给她的那袋装满药丸的密封袋。此刻，她发现这些药丸与几秒钟前相比，模样大不相同。红色部分正渗入白色区域，所有药丸都变成了深红色，鲜血般的颜色。当她拿起袋子凝视时，药丸在塑料袋内似乎移动变换。紧接着，每个胶囊的内容物迅速爆裂，从中渗出黏稠的红色液体，如同小小的血色喷发，很快袋子里就充满了浓稠的红色液体，而空空的胶囊壳则漂浮其中。

Rei's stomach heaved at the sight and, still holding the bag, she quickly ran to the bathroom of her apartment and emptied the contents of her stomach in to the toilet bowl.

看到这一幕，绫的胃一阵翻腾，她手里还抓着袋子，迅速跑进公寓的卫生间，对着马桶吐出了胃里的东西。

As she hunched there, breathing heavily. She noted the small red and white capsule she had just swallowed now floating whole and undamaged in the water at the bottom of the bowl. She turned her head and looked at the zip-lock bag still clutched in her sweaty hand. All of the little red and white pills still sat innocently inside it, showing no sign of the horror that she had witnessed mere seconds earlier.

她蜷缩在那里，呼吸沉重。她注意到刚刚吞下的那颗小红白胶囊，此刻完好无损地漂浮在碗底的水中。她转过头，看向手中紧握的密封袋，里面的小红白药片依旧无辜地躺在那里，丝毫没有显露出几秒钟前她所目睹的恐怖景象。

'Now that you have seen what they are poisoning us with, are you still resolved to take them?' The voice that was her own asked her in her mind. Rei looked at them and thought about trying to swallow another capsule. Immediately her stomach lurched again and she dropped the bag to the grimy, tiled floor as if it had burnt her.

既然你已经知道他们用什么毒害我们，你还决心要吃这些药吗？她内心那个声音质问着。绫看着那些药，考虑是否再吞下一粒胶囊。顿时，她的胃又是一阵翻腾，她像被烫到一样，急忙将药袋扔到肮脏的瓷砖地板上。

Eventually she had picked it up again with distaste, opened up the zip lock seal with sweaty fingers, and emptied the contents into the toilet bowl. She pressed the flush and within seconds all of those hateful little red and white capsules that had held her in their thrall were gone.

最终，她带着厌恶重新拿起它，用汗湿的手指打开密封条，将里面的东西倒进马桶。她按下冲水键，几秒钟内，那些曾让她沉迷其中的可恨红白胶囊便消失无踪。

The girl knew that what she had done would make Doctor Akagi and probably the Commander very angry with her. Nonetheless Rei felt a unfamiliar surge of guilt-tinged relief at being rid of those disgusting little red and white capsules.

女孩知道自己的行为会让阿基医生和可能还有指挥官非常生气。尽管如此，绫还是感到了一种陌生的、夹杂着内疚的解脱感，摆脱了那些令人厌恶的红白小胶囊。

Since that day nearly three weeks earlier Rei Ayanami had noticed many varied and subtle changes in the way that the world appeared to her. She no longer felt nauseous all of the time. Bright light, even sunlight, were not painful for her to be out in anymore. The most unfamiliar and yet strangely pleasurable thing was the new-found ability to experience unfettered emotional responses to the people and events around her.

自从大约三周前的那一天起，绫波丽察觉到世界在她眼中发生了许多微妙而多样的变化。她不再一直感到恶心。即使是阳光，也不再让她感到外出时的痛苦。最陌生却又奇妙地令人愉悦的是，她发现自己能够对周围的人和事产生无拘无束的情感反应。

Even here in school she let the feelings and emotions of her classmates around her wash over her. She found the unfiltered emotional output of her fellow teenagers very agreeable to observe. Certainly she had felt better than she had at any other time in her life in those last few weeks.

即便在学校，她也任由周围同学的情感和情绪涌向自己。她发现观察同龄人未经筛选的情感表达颇为惬意。无疑，在过去的几周里，她感觉比以往任何时候都要好。

She looked around further and saw that Kensuke Aida was present also. The spectacled boy sat at his usual position at the back of the class. His laptop already open in front of him as he tapped idly at the keyboard. Trawling for information on the Evangelions or some other military trivia, Rei guessed.

她继续环顾四周，发现绀野木绵季也在场。这位戴眼镜的男孩坐在教室后排他常坐的位置上，面前的笔记本电脑已经打开，他正漫不经心地敲打着键盘。绫波丽猜测，他可能又在搜索关于 EVA 或其他军事琐事的信息。

However, she noted, the desk immediately to the left of Mr. Aida's, the one usually occupied by Suzuhara, was empty. Why would the tall student, who seemed to be one of pilot Ikari's constant companions at the school, not be in today?

然而，她注意到，紧邻相田先生办公桌左侧、通常由铃原占据的那个位置，今天却是空着的。那位高个子学生，似乎是学校里与碇真嗣形影不离的伙伴之一，为何今天没有出现呢？

It appeared that Rei was not the only one curious as to the track-suited boy's whereabouts.

看来对那个穿着运动服的男孩行踪感到好奇的，并非只有绫一个人。

After casting a critical eye over the students under her jurisdiction, Hikari Horaki walked quietly to the back of the room to where Kensuke Aida sat. Looking around strangely nervously, Rei felt, the pig tailed girl spoke quietly to him.

在对她管辖下的学生们投以审视的目光后，堀崎光悄悄地走到教室后排，那里坐着相田剑介。扎着马尾的女孩环顾四周，显得有些紧张，她轻声对他说话。

"Kensuke… Where's Tou… Suzuhara today?"

“剑助…今天铃原东治在哪里？”

"Touji?" Kensuke replied more loudly. "Oh yeah, he won't be in today. His little sister is being transferred to the NERV hospital this morning, and he's gone to make sure she settles in okay."

"冬二？" 健介大声回应道，"哦对，他今天不会来。他妹妹今早要转院到 NERV 医院，他去确保她能安顿好。"

"Really?" Hikari answered brightly. "That's great news!"

"真的吗？" 光兴奋地回答，"这真是太好的消息了！"

"Yeah. I've haven't heard Touji sound so happy in ages."

"是啊，我已经很久没听到冬二这么开心的声音了。"

"It's so nice that he cares for his little sister so much.." Hikari said. "He's so kind and compassionate!"

"他这么关心他的小妹妹，真是太好了。" 光说，"他真是个善良又富有同情心的人！"

"Um… yeah.. I guess." Kensuke answered uncertainly.

"呃……嗯，我想是的。" 健介不确定地回答道。

"Yes… anyway. That's good news..." Hikari replied suddenly blushing. "L-Let him know that I'm v-very happy for him!"

"是的…不管怎样，这是个好消息……" 光突然脸红着回答，"告、告诉他，我为他感到非常高兴！"

"Sure thing, Class Rep!" 当然可以，班长！

Rei watched them standing awkwardly for a few more seconds as the Class Representative's face grew more pink under the spectacled boy's gaze. 'The Class Representative appears to be embarrassed.' Rei thought to herself curiously. Strangely Kensuke appeared to find this amusing and was chuckling to himself at her discomfort.

零又观察了他们几秒钟，只见班长在戴眼镜男孩的注视下，脸色越发粉红。'班长似乎很尴尬。'零好奇地想。奇怪的是，健介似乎觉得这很有趣，正暗自窃笑她的窘态。

Happily, for Hikari, the bell sounded for the beginning of the school day. Immediately she was back in Class Representative mode.

幸运的是，对于光来说，上课铃声响起，宣告了学校一天的开始。她立刻切换回了班级代表的模式。

"Come on everyone!" She yelled. "At your desks before Sensei arrives!"

"大家快点！"她喊道，"在老师来之前回到座位上！"

As if summoned like some kind of geriatric djinn, the old man appeared at the front sliding door of the classroom and made his way to his desk.

仿佛被某种老年精灵召唤一般，老人出现在教室前方的滑动门前，缓缓走向自己的讲桌。

"Rise… Bow… Sit!" Hikari barked. The students obeyed automatically.

"起立… 鞠躬… 坐下！" 光喊道。学生们自动服从。

And so, the latest lesson of Second Impact Studies was underway.

于是，第二次冲击研究的最新课程开始了。

Rei sat staring out of the window, apparently disinterested in the world around her. In reality her insides were still in turmoil. She could not escape the certainty that somehow, somewhere, she was urgently needed. Though for what she still had no idea.

丽坐在那里，凝视着窗外，显然对周围的世界漠不关心。实际上，她的内心依旧波澜起伏。她无法摆脱那种确信，即在某个地方，某种程度上，她正迫切地被需要着。尽管她仍然不清楚是为了什么。

The school day continued its slow grind on to recess.

学校的一天继续缓慢地推进到课间休息。

Misato cursed as the truck that they were travelling in jolted over a pothole, causing her to spill some of her coffee on the front of her skirt.

美里咒骂着，他们乘坐的卡车颠簸着驶过一个坑洼，导致她把一些咖啡洒在了裙子的前襟上。

"Ah, crap! You'd think that they'd do something about these goddamned roads! Look at my skirt!"

啊，真糟糕！你以为他们会处理一下这些该死的道路！看看我的裙子！

"Yeah…" Asuka answered, without even glancing at the Major from her seat. "It's a modern tragedy."

"是啊…" 明日香回答道，坐在座位上甚至没有看少校一眼。"这是现代的悲剧。"

"Hmph." Misato replied to the jibe, still trying to mop up the spill.

"哼。" 面对嘲讽，葛城美里回应了一声，同时还在努力清理洒落的东西。

After a few moments she finished as best as she could and looked over at her young companion. So far on the long and occasionally bumpy ride towards Matsushiro she hadn't been able to coax more than a couple of syllables out of the girl. Beneath her red hair the German teen looked pale and sweaty. Here bright blue eyes stood out against her alabaster skin, though her face had a slightly sunken hollow look.

过了一会儿，她尽力完成了手头的事情，然后看向她年轻的同伴。在前往松代的长途且偶尔颠簸的旅途中，她还没能从这个女孩口中套出超过几个音节的话。德国少女的红发下，脸色苍白，额头冒汗。她那明亮的蓝眼睛在雪白的肌肤上格外显眼，但面容却略显凹陷，带着几分憔悴。

She looked to Misato like someone who was being haunted by some horror that she could not fully comprehend. Asuka's body language was completely defensive, like she was trying to make herself as small as possible in the spacious seating in the truck's cab.

她看起来像是被某种无法完全理解的恐怖所缠绕，这让美里心生怜悯。明日香的肢体语言充满了防御性，仿佛在试图在卡车驾驶室宽敞的座位上尽可能地缩小自己。

"You doing okay, kiddo?" Misato asked with forced cheerfulness masking her concern.

"你还好吗，小家伙？" 葛城美里用勉强的欢快语气掩饰着她的担忧问道。

"Mmm…" "嗯……"

"What's eating you, Asuka?" The Major said in a kindly tone. "Ever since you were told about this activation you've been acting like someone ran over your puppy. What's up?"

"怎么了，明日香？"少校用温和的语气问道，"自从你得知这次激活任务后，你就一副心事重重的样子，像是有人碾了你的小狗似的。出什么事了？"

"You… you wouldn't understand."

你……你不会明白的。

"Try me." 试试我。

Asuka rolled her eyes at Misato and let out a heavy sigh.

明日香对美里翻了个白眼，重重地叹了口气。

"You know something Misato?" The redhead began. "I've realised that up to now… I've been just playing around in the shallow end… You know, going along pretty much as I always have, I guess…"

“你知道吗，美里？”红发女子开始说道，“我意识到直到现在……我一直只是在浅水区玩耍……你知道的，基本上还是像往常一样随波逐流，我想……”

Misato looked puzzled. "You have?"

碇真嗣点了点头，“是的，我确实有。” 请注意，这个翻译是基于上下文假设的，因为源文本中没有提供完整的对话背景。如果需要更准确的翻译，请提供完整的对话或上下文信息。

"Yeah." Asuka answered her. "And now… to use a well worn cliché, I realise that... this shit is gonna get real, and I have no idea what the fuck I'm gonna do about it!"

"嗯。" 明日香回答道，"现在……用一个老掉牙的说法，我意识到……这事儿要变得严重了，而我他妈的完全不知道该怎么应对！"

"You sure do swear a lot these days…" Misato observed, before gathering her thoughts more coherently. "What's going to 'get real', Asuka? Is it about Shinji? I know that you two are a lot closer these days. I've been turning a blind eye to the fact that you two have started sharing a room, 'cos I know what the two of you have been through. I'm actually really happy for you. I trust the two of you to be smart, even though you're both young. I know that you're smart enough not to take things too far just yet."

"你最近确实经常说脏话啊……" 明日香观察着，然后更清晰地整理了一下思绪。"什么事情要'变得真实'了，明日香？是关于真嗣吗？我知道你们俩最近关系更近了。我对于你们开始共用一个房间的事实视而不见，因为我了解你们俩经历过什么。我其实真的很为你们高兴。我相信你们俩都很聪明，尽管你们还年轻。我知道你足够聪明，不会让事情失控的。"

"You know about that?" Asuka said with some alarm. "I thought that we were being a bit more careful about it than that."

"你知道那件事吗？" 明日香有些吃惊地说，"我还以为我们对此会更加小心谨慎呢。"

"I know that you two thought that you'd outsmarted me!" Misato replied with a condescending smile. "But I've been around for far too long for you to pull the wool over my eyes, Asuka. You should know that you can't keep any secrets from me!"

"我知道你们俩以为自己比我聪明！" 葛城以一种居高临下的微笑回应道，"但你们要知道，我经历的太多了，你们是蒙不了我的，明日香。你应该明白，你在我面前藏不住任何秘密！"

A knowing smile briefly crossed the young redhead's face. "I wouldn't be too sure about that, Misato…" She said quietly.

一个会心的微笑短暂地掠过这位年轻红发女孩的脸庞。“美里，我可不那么肯定哦……”她轻声说道。

There was a few moments silence between the two women as the truck bounced and rocked along the poorly maintained road. Then a frightening thought struck the Major. "Oh god... You're not pregnant, are you?"

两位女士之间有片刻的沉默，卡车在保养不善的道路上颠簸摇晃。突然，少校脑海中闪过一个可怕的念头。“哦，天哪...你不会是怀孕了吧？”

To the Major's surprise and relief Asuka actually laughed. Her careworn expression briefly giving way to a more relaxed smile. "So what was all of that about 'trust', Misato?" She said when she had finally finished. "No, for your information, I am not pregnant! I am still a virgin, thank you very much!"

令少校既惊讶又宽慰的是，明日香居然笑了。她那忧心忡忡的表情短暂地让位于一个更放松的微笑。“那么，这一切关于‘信任’的事情是怎么回事，美里？”她终于说完后问道。“不，告诉你，我并没有怀孕！我还是个处女，非常感谢！”

"I'm glad to hear it!" Misato replied with a relieved sigh.

"很高兴听到这个消息！" 葛城小姐回答道，松了一口气。

"For now… " The redhead muttered, casting a sideways glance at her guardian. In return Misato narrowed her eyes at Asuka meaningfully before deciding that the German girl was probably just joking with her.

“眼下……”红发少女喃喃自语，斜眼瞥向她的监护人。而美里则意味深长地眯起眼睛回望明日香，随后断定这位德国女孩大概只是在跟她开玩笑。

Another uncomfortable silence settled over the cabin.

机舱内再次陷入了令人不适的沉默。

"How much longer until we get there?" Asuka finally asked.

"还要多久才能到那里？" 明日香终于问道。

Misato looked at her watch. "About half an hour or so."

美里看了看手表，说道：“大约半小时左右。”

"Great…" Asuka murmured sullenly. She drew her knees up to her chest as she huddled back into her seat. "I feel sick…"

"太棒了……" 明日香闷闷不乐地嘟囔着。她把膝盖抱到胸前，蜷缩回座位上。"我感觉想吐……"

Misato frowned as she looked over at Asuka. She was feeling deeply troubled by the redhead's dark mood. Rarely, for the purple haired woman, she was completely at a loss for words in the face of her ward's apparent distress.

看着明日香，美里皱起了眉头。她深感困扰，因为这位红发少女的情绪异常低落。对于这位紫发女性来说，这种情况实属罕见，面对自己监护人的明显痛苦，她竟完全无言以对。

The convoy rumbled on slowly through the tumbledown villages that dotted the landscape around Matsushiro. Even at this hour of the morning the stifling heat beat down on the landscape making it appear to Misato a ruined wilderness, completely devoid of human life.

车队缓缓驶过松代周围遍布的破败村落，即便是在清晨时分，闷热的高温也笼罩着这片土地，使得它对美里来说宛如一片荒废的荒野，全无人烟。

"Misato…" Asuka finally broke the silence, although she still refused to meet the Major's eyes.

"Misato…" 明日香终于打破了沉默，尽管她仍然拒绝与少校对视。

"Yeah?" "是吗？"

"If something goes wrong here, tell him… tell Shinji that I died instantly."

如果这里出了什么问题，告诉他……告诉真嗣，我瞬间就死了。

"Wh-What?" Misato said in complete shock. "What the hell are you talking about, Asuka?"

"什、什么？" 碇真嗣完全震惊地说道，"你在说什么鬼话，明日香？"

"Nothing…" Asuka answered, already regretting what she had said.

"没什么……" 明日香回答道，已经开始后悔自己所说的话了。

"Doesn't sound like 'nothing'!" Misato said. "I don't know what's going on with you, Asuka." She was now feeling genuine concern for the girl's state of mental well-being. "You know that you can tell me anything… in complete confidence."

"听起来可不像'没事'！" 美里说道，"我不知道你到底怎么了，明日香。" 她现在真的开始担心这个女孩的心理状态了。"你知道的，你可以完全信任地告诉我任何事。"

"Careful what you wish for, Misato."

小心你的愿望，美里。

"Will you stop being so goddamned cryptic!" She just about yelled at the girl. Finally Asuka looked at her. Misato was shocked to see tears in her bright blue eyes.

"你能不能别这么该死的神秘了！" 她几乎是对着那女孩吼出来的。终于，明日香看向了她。美里震惊地发现，她那明亮的蓝眼睛里噙着泪水。

"Fine," Asuka said with a sad smile. "If I survive this… and let me tell you, that's a pretty big if! Maybe… just maybe, you, me, and Shinji can have a serious talk."

"好吧，"明日香带着一丝苦笑说，"如果我能挺过这一关……让我告诉你，这可是个相当大的假设！或许……只是或许，你、我和真嗣能有一次认真的谈话。"

She turned back to the window effectively ending the conversation.

她转身面向窗户，实际上结束了这场对话。

"Well… good." Misato replied to the girl's back. Her own sense of foreboding now settled firmly in her gut.

"嗯……好的。" 惣流回应着女孩的背影，自己心中的不祥预感此刻已牢牢扎根在腹中。

Matsushiro Base 1357hrs 松代基地 1357 时

Asuka spat into the basin, trying to clear her mouth of the bitter taste of bile. Pooling a little of the running water into her cupped hands, she brought them to her mouth and gingerly sipped some of the metallic tasting liquid. She gripped the sides of the basin tightly as her stomach convulsed one more time before, with a force of will, she kept the liquid down.

明日香朝水槽吐了一口，试图清除嘴里的苦胆味。她双手捧起一些流动的水，小心翼翼地啜饮了几口带有金属味的液体。她紧紧抓住水槽边缘，胃部再次痉挛，但凭借意志力，她终于将液体稳住，没有再吐出来。

"This is ridiculous." She muttered to herself. "Get a grip, Soryu… she can't have brought you back just for this! Can she? It doesn't make any sense… I mean how many times are these stupid robots going to kill me?"

“这太荒谬了。”她自言自语道，“振作点，Soryu……她不可能只是为了这个把你带回来的！对吧？这根本说不通……我是说，这些愚蠢的机器人还要杀我多少次？”

She looked up from the swirling water and into the mirror. A pale and bloodshot eyed girl in a red plug suit stared back at her.

她从旋转的水中抬起头，望向镜子。一个面色苍白、眼带血丝的女孩，穿着红色插头服，正凝视着她。

"Ikuhayo, Asuka." She said grimly to her reflection

"走吧，明日香。" 她对着自己的倒影冷冷地说道。

"Miss Ayanami, is everything alright?" The old sensei asked querulously.

"绫波小姐，一切都还好吗？" 老教师关切地问道。

Rei looked around her in mild surprise. All of the remaining students of class 2-A had turned around to stare at her. She did not remember standing up, but she was now on her feet standing behind her desk, with her plastic backed school chair lying on the floor behind her where it had apparently fallen when she had risen.

零有些惊讶地环顾四周，发现 2-A 班剩下的所有学生都转过身来盯着她。她不记得自己站起来了，但现在她确实站在桌子后面，她的塑料椅背的学校椅子躺在她身后的地板上，显然是在她起身时倒下的。

Her hands were gripping the sides of her desk painfully, the flesh of her knuckles turning white with the strain. She was faintly aware that she had spoken, though she could not remember what it was that she had actually said.

她的双手紧紧抓住桌边，痛楚地用力，指节因紧张而变得苍白。她隐约意识到自己已经开口说话，却记不清究竟说了些什么。

"Yes, Sensei." She said after a pause.

"是的，老师。" 她停顿了一下后说道。

"Then please return to your seat."

那么请回到您的座位。

Rei sketched a small bow and righted her fallen chair, before sitting down behind her desk once more. A couple of the other girls in the class giggled at her, before being silenced by a look from Hikari.

绫绘了一个小鞠躬，扶正倒下的椅子，然后再次坐回桌后。班上其他几个女生对她咯咯笑了几声，但在光的一个眼神下立刻安静了下来。

"Very good." The sensei continued. "Now, if there are no more interruptions, we shall proceed. Mr Aida, please continue reading."

“非常好。”老师继续说道，“现在，如果没有更多打断的话，我们就开始吧。相田先生，请继续朗读。”

"Yes, Sensei." Kensuke said before returning to reading aloud from the U.N. approved Second Impact Studies textbook.

"是的，老师。" 健介回答后，继续朗读联合国批准的《第二次冲击研究》教科书。

Rei let her thoughts wander once more, her gaze straying to the view out of the classroom window. However, her thoughts were disturbed by the strong sensation that someone was staring at her. She turned back to the classroom and almost immediately found herself locking eyes with the Third Child. Shinji was staring at her intently, though also in some obvious confusion. After several seconds he broke off his gaze and returned his attention to the text in front of him.

绫的思绪再次飘远，目光不自觉地投向教室窗外。然而，一阵强烈的被人注视的感觉打断了她的思绪。她转回教室，几乎立刻与第三适格者对上了视线。真嗣正专注地凝视着她，眼神中带着明显的困惑。几秒后，他移开了目光，重新将注意力放回面前的课本上。

Rei felt sick.

丽感到恶心。

Her first sight of Unit 03 did little to quell the purple haired Major's anxiety.

她首次目睹 03 号单位时，并未能缓解这位紫发少校的焦虑。

The black Evangelion had a feral air to it that radiated menace even from the safety of the cramped bridge at the Matsushiro base. Misato watched as the cylindrical entry plug was slowly lifted into place behind the neck of the enormous grinning robot.

黑色的福音战士散发着野性的气息，即使在松代基地狭小的指挥桥上也能感受到它散发出的威胁。碇真嗣注视着圆柱形的插入栓缓缓升起，安置在巨大狞笑机器人颈后的位置。

She toggled open a communications window.

她切换打开了一个通讯窗口。

"How's it going in there, Asuka?" She said.

"里面怎么样了，明日香？" 她说道。

"It's freaking freezing in here!" Came Asuka's reply over the speakers, causing a chuckle from several of the Matsushiro techs on the bridge. Most of them only knew of the Second Child from reputation, and it seemed that there was little genuine sympathy for the German girl.

"这里冷得要命！"扬声器里传来明日香的声音，引得桥上几位松代技术人员轻笑。他们大多数人只是听说过第二适格者的名声，对这位德国女孩似乎并没有多少真切的同情。

That annoyed Misato enormously. "What's with the LCL temperature?" She barked at one of the smirking techs across the bridge.

这让美里非常恼火。“LCL 温度是怎么回事？”她冲着桥对面一个窃笑的技术员厉声问道。

"It's just been shipped from cold storage in Tokyo-03. Once the recirculation system comes online it will reach operating temperature in a couple of minutes." He answered.

它刚从东京 03 的冷藏库发出。一旦再循环系统上线，它将在几分钟内达到工作温度。他回答道。

"Make it happen, lieutenant!" Misato said harshly. "I'll be holding you responsible for any delays"

"让它发生，中尉！" 葛城严厉地说道，"我会因为你造成的任何延误而追究你的责任。"

The man stiffened. "Yes, Ma'am!" He answered smartly.

那人顿时紧张起来。“是的，女士！”他机灵地回答道。

"Man…" Misato muttered shaking her head. "Why the hell do we have to come all the way out to goddamned Hicksville for this stupid test."

“天哪…” 美里嘟囔着，摇了摇头，“我们到底为什么要为了这个愚蠢的测试，大老远跑到这个鬼地方来。”

"Because NERV doesn't have the capacity to support four Evangelions at Tokyo-03 at the same time." Came the answer. Misato looked around to see that Ritsuko had just entered the bridge.

"因为 NERV 没有能力同时支持东京-03 的四台 EVA。"回答传来。葛城美里环顾四周，发现赤木律子刚走进指挥室。

"Well, look who finally decided to turn up." Misato griped.

"哎呀，看看是谁终于决定露面了。" 碇真嗣抱怨道。

"Actually, I've been here since 0530 this morning," Ritsuko answered primly, "or did you think that the core would just configure itself?"

"其实，我从今天早上 0530 就一直在了，" 律子一本正经地回答，"难道你以为核心会自己配置好吗？"

"Meh." Was Misato's only answer.

"嗯。" 是美里唯一的回答。

Ritsuko glanced briefly over the plug's telemetry readings. "She's ready to go." She said simply.

律子快速扫了一眼插入栓的遥测数据，简洁地说：“她准备好了。”

Misato let out a sigh of relief. "We're all clear, Asuka!" She said cheerily over the comm.

碇真嗣松了一口气，通过通讯器欢快地说：“我们安全了，明日香！”

"Roger." Came the strained reply. "Let's do this already. The waiting is killing me."

"收到。"传来紧张的回答，"我们开始吧，等待快让我崩溃了。"

With a groan of machinery the plug was driven into the back of the Evangelion. The back armoured plates slid smoothly over the insertion point, covering up any evidence that the plug had ever existed.

随着机械的轰鸣声，插入栓被推入福音战士的背部。背部的装甲板平滑地滑过插入点，掩盖了任何表明插入栓曾经存在的痕迹。

"Begin start up sequence." Dr. Akagi ordered.

"开始启动序列。"赤木博士命令道。

"Yes, Ma'am." 是的，女士。

"Pilot vitals are reading elevated heart rate and limbic activity." One of the techs reported. "Cortisol readings in the LCL spiking above nominal levels."

"飞行员的生命体征显示心率加快和边缘系统活动增强。" 一名技术人员报告说，"皮质醇水平在低浓度区急剧上升，超过了正常值。"

"Asuka," Misato said through the Comm. Channel. "Keep it together! This is just a routine activation, you've done this a hundred times."

"明日香，" 美里通过通讯频道说道，"保持镇定！这只是常规启动，你已经做过无数次了。"

"Let's just do this!" Asuka almost snarled back at her.

"就这么办吧！" 明日香几乎咆哮着回应她。

Misato and Ritsuko glanced at each other.

美里和律子相互对视了一眼。

"Clearing absolute boundary." Another tech said.

“正在清除绝对边界。”另一位技术人员说道。

Misato looked tensely at the screen showing the wavelengths of the pilot and the Evangelion as the two lines appeared to firstly clash and rebound off each other, before finally beginning to harmonise. The green and red lines were slowly reaching some kind of equilibrium.

美里紧张地盯着屏幕，上面显示着驾驶员和福音战士的波形，两条线先是碰撞反弹，随后终于开始协调。绿色和红色的线条正缓慢地趋向某种平衡。

"Absolute borderline passed. All systems green."

绝对临界值已通过。所有系统正常。

"You okay in there, Asuka?" Misato asked. "Your synch rate is hovering just above 43 percent! Well done!"

"你在里面还好吗，明日香？" 美里问道，"你的同步率稳定在 43%以上！做得好！"

There was a few seconds silence. "Really?" Came the girl's astonished reply. "You mean that there's no problems? At all?"

沉默了几秒钟。"真的吗？"女孩惊讶地回答，"你的意思是没有任何问题？一点也没有？"

"Well, duh." Misato replied with a grin. "Was there ever any doubt?"

“哎呀，这还用说。” 葛城美里笑着回答，“难道还有疑问吗？”

She was overjoyed to hear Asuka actually laugh in response to her question. "Well… maybe just a little…" She replied.

听到明日香竟然因为自己的问题而笑出声来，她欣喜若狂。“嗯……可能只是有点儿……”她回答道。

Misato smiled at the girl's happy tone. A far cry from the ball of tension she had been last time they had talked.

听到女孩愉快的语气，葛城美里笑了。这与上次谈话时她那紧张的状态相去甚远。

"43 percent is still pretty marginal." Ritsuko said in the background, barely noticed by the Major. "I think that we should increase the plug depth by 0.8."

"43%仍然相当边缘。" 立子在背景中说道，几乎未被少校注意到。"我认为我们应该将插头深度增加 0.8。"

"Roger." One of the techs replied, tapping at her console. "Increasing depth by 0.8."

"收到。" 一位技术人员回应道，同时轻敲着她的控制台，"将深度增加 0.8。"

"See, Asuka?" Misato said brightly. "You were all worried over nothing!"

"看，明日香？" 惣流笑着说，"你之前完全是杞人忧天！"

"Maybe… Though if you ever tell…" The girl's voice stopped mid sentence. "Wait a second… Something's different…"

"或许……不过如果你说出去的话……" 女孩的声音说到一半戛然而止。"等一下……有些不对劲……"

"Dr Akagi," The tech said nervously, "We're reading some unexpected resonance in the synchronisation matrix."

"Dr. Akagi," 技术员紧张地说，"我们在同步矩阵中检测到了一些意外的共振现象。"

"Let me see…" Ritsuko said as she started rapidly tapping at her own keyboard.

"让我看看……" 律子说着，开始迅速敲击自己的键盘。

"Different?" Misato asked. "What do you mean different, Asuka?"

"不同？" 明日香问道。"你说的不同是什么意思，明日香？"

"I… I don't know…" Asuka answered. "It's like there's something…"

"我……我不知道……" 明日香回答道，"就好像有什么东西……"

"Wavelength feedback detected within Unit 03!"

"在 03 单元内检测到波长反馈！"

"What did you say?" Misato yelled at the tech, a sick feeling beginning to form in the pit of her stomach. Before he could answer her a gasp over the communication channel from Asuka caught her attention.

"你说什么？" 三佐对着技术人员吼道，一种不安的感觉开始在她的胃里形成。还没等他回答，通讯频道中明日香的一声惊呼吸引了她的注意。

"Asuka, are you alright?"

“明日香，你还好吗？”

"Sh-She's so beautiful…" “她真是太美了……”

"Who is?" Misato shouted back in alarm. "What's going on, Asuka? Talk to me!"

"是谁？" 惣流·明日香惊慌地喊回去。"发生了什么，明日香？跟我说说！"

"So beautiful!" Asuka repeated. "Just like I remember…"

"太美了！" 明日香重复道，"就像我记忆中的那样……"

"Asuka! Answer me! What do you see?"

明日香！回答我！你看到了什么？

"Mama… " 妈妈…

"Oh my God!" Ritsuko shouted. "The waveform is collapsing in on itself! It's going to… "

"天哪！" 律子惊呼道，"波形正在自我坍缩！它要……"

She was drowned out by a piercing scream from the Second Child.

她被第二适格者的一声尖锐尖叫所淹没。

"Asuka!" Misato yelled. "What's going on Ritsuko?"

"明日香！" 美里喊道。"发生了什么事，律子？"

"Massive energy spike detected within Unit 03!" A tech called in alarm.

"三号机内部检测到巨大能量峰值！" 一名技术人员惊呼道。

"Wavelength detected, Blue!" Another screamed.

检测到波长，蓝色！" 另一个人尖叫道。

"What did you say?" The black giant was now beginning to heave and convulse against its restraints. Misato was only paralysed for a split second before all of her combat training kicked in. "Eject the plug! Transmit the abort code."

"你说什么？" 黑色巨人此刻开始在束缚中挣扎抽搐。仅仅一瞬间的僵硬后，所有战斗训练的本能立即在葛城身上发挥作用。"弹出插入栓！发送终止代码。"

"Unit 03 is rejecting the signal!"

"三号单位正在拒绝信号！"

"Re-transmit! Inject Bakelite into the cage!"

重新发送！向笼内注入酚醛树脂！

Asuka's scream was still clawing at the inside of Misato's skull as the Major desperately tried to contain the writhing Evangelion.

明日香的尖叫声仍在美里脑海中回荡，此时少校正拼命试图控制住那扭动的福音战士。

Suddenly the screaming was cut off as the communication line went dead.

突然间，尖叫声戛然而止，通讯线路中断了。

"A-T Field detected! Energy spike reaching critical levels!"

"A-T 力场侦测到！能量峰值已达临界水平！"

Just before the world exploded in white, she saw the jaw restraining bolts shear clean through as Unit 03's head reared back and its mouth opened in a horrific parody of a scream.

在世界被白光吞没的前一刻，她目睹了 03 号机头颅猛然后仰，嘴部张开，形成一幅恐怖的尖叫模仿图景，而下巴固定螺栓则齐刷刷地断裂。

"I need you to focus, Shinji!"

"我需要你集中注意力，真嗣！"

"M-Miss Ibuki…" The boy stammered, his distress clear even through the communication channel. "What about Asuka, and Miss Misato?"

"伊吹小姐……" 男孩结结巴巴地说道，即使通过通讯频道，也能明显感受到他的焦虑。"那明日香和美里小姐呢？"

"We don't know yet!" Maya said gently, trying to calm the boy. "All we know is that there's been an incident at Matsushiro. All of our communication lines with the base there are silent."

"我们还不知道呢！" 玛雅轻声说道，试图安抚那个男孩。"我们所了解的只是松代那边发生了事故。我们与那里的基地的所有通信线路都沉默了。"

"B-But Fath… the Commander said that there was an Angel?"

"可是法斯……指挥官说那里有天使？"

"That's right, Shinji." The young lieutenant replied grimly. "Our sensors indicate a blue wavelength in the area. That's probably what's blocking our transmissions. Once you land I'm sure that things will become more clear."

"没错，真嗣。"年轻的少尉严肃地回答，"我们的传感器在这个区域检测到了蓝色波长，那可能就是阻碍我们通讯的原因。一旦你降落，我相信情况会变得更加明朗。"

"Lieutenant." Came the voice of the Commander from his position above the bridge. "Please refrain from engaging in unnecessary conjecture with the pilots. We need the communication channels clear in case more important information comes to hand."

"中尉。"指挥官从桥上的位置传来声音，"请避免与飞行员进行不必要的猜测。我们需要保持通信渠道畅通，以防有更重要的信息传来。"

"Y-Yes, sir." "是的，先生。"

The silence over the bridge weighed heavily on the young tech. She bowed her head over her keyboard and prayed a silent prayer that Dr. Akagi had not been hurt.

桥上的寂静沉重地压在年轻的技术员心头。她低头对着键盘，默默祈祷赤木博士没有受伤。

"Wings 00 and 01 approaching drop zone." Came the harsh metallic voice of the flight commander of the huge Evangelion flying transports.

"翼 00 和 01 正接近投放区。" 传来巨大福音战士飞行运输机飞行指挥官那刺耳的金属声音。

The three main techs turned to look up at Commander Ikari, who merely nodded a their unspoken question.

三位主要技术人员转头望向伊卡里指挥官，他只是对他们未说出口的问题点了点头。

"R-Roger." Hyuga stuttered, feeling lost without Major Katsuragi's guiding hand. "Drop on my mark."

"R-罗杰。" 日向结巴着说，感觉失去了葛城少校的引导便迷失了方向。"在我标记时降落。"

"Shinji, Rei." He continued as he waited for the coordinates to align with the projected drop zone. "Once you've landed, rendezvous with the mobile support column and connect your umbilical cables. Then await further instruction."

"真嗣，绫波。" 他在等待坐标与预定降落区对齐时继续说道，"一旦着陆，与机动支援柱会合，并连接你们的脐带电缆。然后等待进一步指令。"

"Hai." Both Children replied automatically. Rei's face a mask of placidity, Shinji's betraying his deep anxiety and concern.

"嗨。" 两个孩子机械地回应道。丽的面容平静如常，而真嗣的脸上则流露出深深的忧虑和关切。

After a few more tension filled seconds the coordinates on Hyuga's monitor flashed green. "Eva wing, on my mark…" He called over the channel. The numbers stopped flashing. "Release!"

又过了几秒紧张的时刻，日向的监视器上的坐标闪烁着绿色。“Eva 翼，听我指令…”他通过频道呼叫。数字停止了闪烁。“释放！”

The cameras onboard the two transports showed the Evangelions releasing and dropping rapidly toward the Earth far below. Units 01 and 00 quickly became small coloured dots against the landscape. Two small plumes of dust finally marking their landing points. Switching to the Eva's external feed, they were guided to the support units and told to await further developments.

两架运输机上的摄像头捕捉到福音战士释放并急速向下方遥远的地球坠落的画面。零号机和初号机很快在背景中变成了小小的彩色斑点。最终，两小团尘埃标记出了它们的着陆点。切换到 Eva 的外部视频源后，他们被引导至支援单位，并被告知等待进一步的指示。

They didn't have to wait for long.

他们不需要等太久。

Asuka Langley Soryu was fighting for her life.

明日香·兰格雷正在为生存而战。

Initially she thought that maybe the test was going to be okay. Maybe the Angel would take on a different form this time. She had breached the synchronisation threshold with Unit 03 far more easily than she had expected. She even reached a more than respectable 43 percent on her first try. Nothing sinister or out of the ordinary had occurred.

起初，她以为这次测试或许会顺利。也许这次天使会以不同的形态出现。她与 03 号机体的同步阈值突破得远比预期中容易，甚至在首次尝试时就达到了令人尊敬的 43%同步率。一切正常，没有发生任何不祥或异常的情况。

She had actually felt overjoyed at the result, even allowing herself to laugh in relief. Not even feeling any concern as Dr. Akagi had pushed the plug depth deeper into the American Evangelion. Maybe Lilith had pulled some strings to save her ass in this test? Maybe…

她对结果实际上感到欣喜若狂，甚至让自己如释重负地笑了出来。即便阿卡迪博士将插头更深地推入美国版福音战士，她也毫不担心。或许莉莉丝在这场测试中暗中帮了她一把？或许吧……

Then things had gotten weird.

然后事情就变得奇怪了。

The swirling kaleidoscope of colour that accompanied the increase in the plug depth had held little interest to her. She had seen such light-shows more times than she could count during her young life. This time though, it was different.

随着插头深度增加，伴随而来的色彩漩涡万花筒对她来说并无多少吸引力。在她年轻的生命中，这样的光影秀她已见过无数次，数不胜数。然而这一次，情况却有所不同。

The plug grew darker and the colours changed and began to form an image that floated in front of her. The image that quickly formed was that of a woman in her late twenties. Her auburn shoulder length hair waved in the LCL of the plug and her bright blue eyes were almost a mirror of Asuka's own. The woman radiated an overwhelming sense of peace and surrender as she smiled at the girl. Forgetting everything else, Asuka had been lost in the kindness of the woman's eyes.

插头颜色逐渐加深，色彩变幻，开始在前方形成一个漂浮的影像。迅速成形的影像是一位二十八九岁的女性，她那赤褐色的齐肩秀发在插入栓的 LCL 中飘动，明亮的蓝眼睛几乎与明日香如出一辙。女子面带微笑，散发出一种令人心安的平和与顺从感。明日香忘却了周遭一切，沉醉于女子眼中的温柔。

Asuka had reached out to her, but the apparition drew back, almost seeming to fade against the darkness of the interior of the plug. The German girl's heart was pierced by a longing to touch the woman. She faintly remembered calling out to her.

明日香曾试图触碰她，但那幻影却退缩了，几乎要融入插入栓内部的黑暗之中。这位德国女孩的心被一种渴望触碰那女人的情感所刺痛。她依稀记得自己曾呼唤过她。

"Mama… "

At that the woman had come forward once again, her arms reaching out to the girl in the pilot's seat. As the hands had passed through Asuka's own a sharp stab of cold pain had lanced through Asuka from the point of contact. At that everything had changed.

就在那时，那位女士再次上前，双臂伸向坐在驾驶座上的女孩。当她的手穿过明日香的手时，一股刺骨的冷痛从接触点直刺明日香。那一刻，一切都变了。

The beautiful, serene face of her lost mother has begun to peel and suppurate before her horrified eyes. The skin blackened and sloughed back from the top of her head down. Hair, skin, and flesh putrefying and peeling away from the skull. Within seconds all that was left was a leering death's head that still grinned at the girl who cowered in the cockpit.

她已故母亲的美丽宁静面容，在她惊恐的眼前开始剥落并化脓。皮肤从头顶向下变黑并脱落。头发、皮肤和肉体在头骨上腐烂剥离。几秒钟内，剩下的只是一个狞笑的骷髅头，依旧对着驾驶舱内蜷缩的女孩咧嘴而笑。

The empty eye sockets stared at her as the apparition leaned in closer to her, almost seeming to touch her face as she pulled away from it in disgust and horror.

空洞的眼窝紧盯着她，幽灵向她靠近，几乎要触碰到她的脸，她带着厌恶和恐惧向后退缩。

'Die with me, Asuka.' It whispered into her mind.

“和我一起死吧，明日香。”它在她的脑海中低语。

Asuka screamed and it seemed had blacked out for some time.

明日香尖叫一声，似乎昏迷了一段时间。

When she had come back to her senses she wasn't in the plug anymore.

当她回过神来时，她已经不在插座里了。

Asuka sat up in from the mattress that lay untidily on the floor. The fire was dying down, giving little light or heat in the dank living area of the small farmhouse. The wind howled outside and the bang and rattle of the shutters was far louder than it usually was.

明日香从凌乱铺在地板上的床垫上坐起身。火势正在减弱，在这间潮湿的小农舍生活区里，几乎提供不了什么光亮或温暖。外面的风呼啸着，百叶窗的砰砰声和嘎嘎声比平时要响得多。

She looked around the small room. She was alone. Shinji was nowhere to be found. Pulling the blanket up around her shoulders she got up from the bed and searched the small kitchen and living areas for the catatonic boy. Still he was nowhere to be seen.

她环顾四周的小房间，孤身一人。真嗣不知所踪。她拉起毯子裹紧肩膀，从床上起身，在小厨房和起居区寻找那个陷入木僵状态的男孩。然而，他依旧不见踪影。

"Scheiße!" She swore. Something tugged at the back of her mind, telling her something wasn't right here. That thought was scattered by a steady drip-drip of water that was coming from the bathroom.

"该死！" 她咒骂道。脑海深处有什么东西在拉扯，告诉她这里有些不对劲。然而，这个念头被浴室传来的持续滴水声打散了。

Running to the door of the bathroom and bursting through it she was assaulted by the stench of old death. Shinji lay in the tub, the copper coloured water barely covering his naked body. He lay stiffly and awkwardly in the bath. She rushed to the side of the tub. She could see in the pale light from the opened window that his skin was grey and lifeless. His eyes were half opened, but unseeing. She reached into the cold bath and pulled his hand up out of the water. A long, bloodless slash ran the length of his left arm.

她冲向浴室门，猛地推开，一股陈腐的死亡气息扑面而来。真嗣躺在浴缸里，铜色的水勉强覆盖着他赤裸的身体。他僵硬而不自然地躺在浴缸中。她急忙跑到浴缸旁。透过敞开的窗户透进的微弱光线，她看到他的皮肤灰暗无光。他的眼睛半睁着，却毫无生气。她伸手进冰冷的浴缸，将他的手从水中拉出。他的左臂上，一道长长的、没有血色的伤口贯穿始终。

Down beside the bath a shard of glass caught the light. Asuka picked it up. Dark dried blood stained its jagged edge.

浴缸旁边，一片碎玻璃捕捉到了光线。明日香拾起它，那锯齿状的边缘上沾着干涸的深色血迹。

She held his cold dead hand to her face. "Shinji…" She cried. "Shinji. Why? Why would you leave me like this?"

她将他冰冷僵硬的手贴在脸上，泪水夺眶而出：“真嗣……”她哽咽着，“真嗣，为什么？为什么要这样离我而去？”

"The boy knew what was inevitable." A dry lifeless voice came from above her. She looked up to see her mother, bare feet a metre off the floorboards, hanging from the light fitting on the other side of the bath. "Why do you resist? Why did you not follow me all of those long lonely years ago? Die with me, Asuka! Die with him."

男孩明白什么是不可避免的。一个干枯无生气的声音从她上方传来。她抬头一看，只见母亲赤脚悬在离地板一米高的地方，挂在浴室另一侧的灯具上。“你为何抗拒？为何那些漫长孤独的岁月里你没有跟随我？和我一起死吧，明日香！和他一起死吧。”

"No!" Asuka cried out. "不！" 明日香喊道。

"It is pointless to avoid the inevitable, child." The hanging form of her dead mother said to her condescendingly. "Why do you refuse my love?"

"逃避不可避免的事情是徒劳的，孩子。"她已故母亲的幽灵居高临下地对她说，"你为何拒绝我的爱？"

"No…" Asuka whispered. "You're not real! None of this is real!"

"不…" 明日香低声说，"你不是真的！这一切都不是真的！"

"Die with me!" 与我同归于尽！

"Never!"

"Stupid child." The voice of her mother said churlishly. "I was going to make this easy for you."

"傻孩子。" 她母亲的声音粗鲁地说道，"我本来想让你轻松点的。"

Suddenly the cabin, her mother, and Shinji disappeared from around her, leaving her in blackness once again.

突然间，机舱、她的母亲和真嗣都从她周围消失了，再次将她留在一片黑暗之中。

"Wondergirl! I could use some fucking help here!" Asuka yelled into the void.

"神奇女孩！我这儿急需帮忙！" 明日香对着虚空大喊。

"Acquiring visual on target." Aoba said over the comm.

“已获取目标视觉。”青叶通过通讯说道。

A horrified hush fell over the bridge as the Angel crested the rise.

当天使出现在坡顶时，桥上陷入了一片惊恐的寂静。

"Th-That's the Angel?" Hyuga stammered.

"那、那就是天使吗？" 日向结巴地说。

"Correct." The Commander replied sternly.

"正确。"指挥官严肃地回答。

"But th-that's an Eva!" Shinji's voice cracked as he spoke.

“但那可是 Eva 啊！” 真嗣说话时声音都变了。

"No." Gendo's answer was absolute. "That is your target. You must destroy it."

"不。" 源渡的回答斩钉截铁。"那是你的目标，你必须摧毁它。"

"Asuka..." The boy said quietly. "She's in there… isn't she?"

"明日香……" 男孩轻声说道，"她在里面……对吧？"

"I don't know, Shinji." Maya answered. "Our sensors are being blocked…"

"我不知道，真嗣。" 玛雅回答道，"我们的传感器被干扰了……"

"Irrelevant." The Commander interrupted the young tech. "Evangelion Unit 03 has been designated as the 13th Angel. You must destroy it or perish."

"无关紧要。"指挥官打断了年轻的技术员。"初号机 03 已被指定为第 13 使徒。你们必须摧毁它，否则就是灭亡。"

"No… It can't be…" The boy whispered plaintively.

"不…这不可能…" 男孩哀怨地低声说道。

Rei listened to the boy's distress. She knew that the Second Child must inevitably be within the entry plug of the rogue Evangelion. She tensed herself. She would try to bear the brunt of this assault. To protect the Third Child from the horror of destroying the girl he loved if nothing else.

绫听着男孩的苦恼。她知道，第二适格者必然就在那失控的福音战士的插入栓内。她绷紧了神经，决心要承受这次攻击的重压。至少要保护第三适格者，不让他面对摧毁心爱女孩的恐怖。

She narrowed her eyes as she watched the black Evangelion clamber across the low hill in the distance, making its way inexorably toward to two waiting units. It move with a feral, animalistic motion, more akin to a crawl than a walk. It let out a low growl as it seemed to spy Unit 01 standing to her right.

她眯起眼睛，注视着远处那台黑色福音战士攀越低矮的山丘，坚定不移地向着两台待命的机体靠近。它的动作野性而动物化，与其说是行走，不如说更像是爬行。当它似乎发现了她右侧的 01 号机时，发出了一声低沉的咆哮。

Unit 00 was the closest to the beast. Once it had come closer she willed her Evangelion forward on a converging course with it.

单位 00 离那头野兽最近。一旦它靠近，她便驱使自己的福音战士与其汇合。

"Unit 00, moving to engage." Rei said simply over the communication channel.

Asuka watched in horror as the thin, vein like, tendrils moved and writhed up her limbs and towards her body. each one carving a path of exquisite agony through her flesh. As they bulged and ran her plug suit tore and fell away, exposing the livid red path that they took.

明日香惊恐地看着那些细如血管的触须蠕动着爬上她的四肢，向身体蔓延。每一条都在她的肌肤上刻下了一条充满剧痛的路径。随着它们的膨胀和移动，她的插入栓服被撕裂脱落，露出了它们所经之处的鲜红痕迹。

"No…" She moaned. "Don't touch me…"

Before her eyes a long bloody mark travelled the length of her right arm. From between the knuckles to the base of her shoulder. Blood began to seep from it into the surrounding LCL giving it a cloudy appearance. As her suit disintegrated further other long forgotten wounds on her chest and belly began to ooze blood as well.

在她眼前，一道长长的血痕沿着她的右臂延伸，从指关节一直到肩部基底。血液开始从伤口渗出，融入周围的 LCL 中，使其呈现出浑浊的外观。随着她的装束进一步瓦解，胸前和腹部那些早已被遗忘的伤口也开始渗出血来。

"Interesting…" The voice of her mother spoke to her from the surrounding darkness. "You are far more corrupted than I could ever have imagined."

"有趣……" 她的母亲的声音从四周的黑暗中传来，"你比我所能想象的还要堕落得多。"

"Go to Hell!" Asuka screamed.

"下地狱去吧！" 明日香尖叫道。

"How quaint." The voice mocked her. "You Lilim are such children!"

"多么古怪啊。"那声音嘲讽着她，"你们莉莉姆真是些孩子！"

"Wondergirl! Help me for fuck's sake!"

"神奇女孩！看在上帝的份上帮帮我吧！"

"Who is this being you keep calling to? Is it one of your primitive gods that you pray to in the darkness?"

你不断呼唤的这位存在是谁？是你在黑暗中祈祷的某个原始神明吗？

Asuka kept struggling to hold back her terror as the tendrils came closer to her body. "Ayanami!" She said quietly, unable to hold back the tears that dissolved instantly in the LCL. "You owe me! Help me, please!"

明日香努力抑制着内心的恐惧，当触手逐渐逼近她的身体时。“绫波！”她低声说道，无法抑制泪水在 LCL 中瞬间溶解。“你欠我的！请帮帮我！”

Rei's nerves screamed in agony as the left arm of her Evangelion was blasted away to prevent further contamination. Unit 03 had been too fast for her, she had been unable to do anything to effectively engage it. It had simply brushed her attack aside with apparently minimal effort.

当雷的使徒的左臂被炸毁以防止进一步污染时，她的神经在痛苦中尖叫。03 号机对她来说太快了，她无法采取任何有效措施与之对抗。它只是轻而易举地挡开了她的攻击。

Once it had her Unit 00 down it had begun to pour some kind of vile viscous liquid into Unit 00's left arm. Rei could feel the poison of it infecting her through her Evangelion. Despite the excruciating agony it had caused her, she knew that the Commander had made the right decision in blasting the arm off to prevent further contamination.

一旦将她的零号机击倒，它就开始向零号机的左臂倾倒某种恶心的粘稠液体。绫波丽能感觉到那种毒液通过她的福音战士感染了她。尽管这给她带来了难以忍受的痛苦，但她知道指挥官决定炸掉手臂以防止进一步污染是正确的。

As if it had achieved its goal the black Eva abandoned Unit 00 in the rice field where it had fallen and stalked towards the still stationery form of Unit 01.

仿佛已达成目标，黑色 Eva 将坠落在稻田中的零号机弃之不顾，缓缓向依然静止不动的初号机逼近。

"Shinji… I'm sorry." Rei whispered to herself.

“真嗣……对不起。”绫波轻声自语。

She watched in mute horror as Unit 03 stalked over to the purple Eva.

她目瞪口呆地看着 03 号机缓缓逼近那台紫色的 Eva。

"Pilot." She heard the stern voice of Commander Ikari over her still active communication channel. "Engage and destroy the target."

"飞行员。" 她听到指挥官碇的声音通过她仍在运作的通讯频道传来，严厉而坚定。"启动并摧毁目标。"

"No!" Shinji screamed in response. "Asuka's in there! I can't!"

"不！" 真嗣尖叫着回应，"明日香在里面！我做不到！"

Unit 03 reached Unit 01 and with ferocious speed its unnaturally long arms lashed out and clasped around the throat of the Evangelion.

第三单元抵达第一单元位置，以惊人的速度，其异常长的手臂猛地伸出，紧紧勒住了福音战士的喉咙。

"Arrrgh!" Shinji's strangled cry echoed over the comm.

"啊！" 真嗣的窒息般的呼喊在通讯中回响。

"You must engage. If you do not then you will die."

你必须参与。如果不参与，你就会死。

"I'd rather die than kill Asuka!" Shinji gasped out. Still Unit 01 did nothing to prevent the rogue Eva from squeezing the life out of it.

"我宁愿死也不愿伤害明日香！" 真嗣喘息着说。然而，初号机依旧没有采取任何行动来阻止那台失控的 EVA 将其生命力榨干。

"Very well." The Commander said. "Lieutenant Ibuki. Ready the dummy plug."

"很好。"指挥官说道，"伊吹少尉，准备模拟插入栓。"

Maya gasped and looked back at the Commander. "But sir, the dummy plug hasn't been tested properly! It's still unstable!"

玛雅倒吸一口凉气，回头望向指挥官。“但是长官，模拟插入栓还没有经过充分测试！它仍然不稳定！”

"It's still better than a pilot that won't fight. Do it!" Gendo ordered.

"这总比一个不愿战斗的飞行员强。动手吧！" 源堂命令道。

"Y-Yes sir!" "是，先生！"

With stumbling fingers Maya began countermanding the fail-safes that prevented the dummy system from taking the control of the Evangelion Unit from its pilot. Before she had even disabled half of them a cry from Lieutenant Aoba caught everyone by surprise.

玛雅用颤抖的手指开始解除那些防止模拟系统从驾驶员手中夺取福音战士控制权的保险措施。她还没来得及解除一半，青叶少尉的一声惊叫就让大家措手不及。

"Second blue reading detected!" He shouted in alarm. "It's coming from within Unit 03!"

"第二次蓝色读数被检测到了！" 他惊慌地喊道，"它来自 03 号单元内部！"

Maya paused at her work in shock, the dummy plug system completely forgotten, as on the screen the rogue Evangelion suddenly tilted its head back and let out an ear splitting roar.

玛雅在工作中震惊地停了下来，完全忘记了模拟插入栓系统，因为屏幕上那台失控的福音战士突然仰起头，发出了一声震耳欲聋的咆哮。

"Ayanami!" Asuka screamed again, fighting the agony that felt like it was tearing her body apart. "How is letting me die in here supposed to help Shinji? Help me you ethereal bitch!"

"绫波！"明日香再次尖叫，与那种仿佛要将她身体撕裂的痛苦抗争。"让我在这里死去怎么可能帮到真嗣？帮我啊，你这幽灵般的贱人！"

"I grow weary of your primitive squawking, Lilim." Her mother's voice said haughtily. "It is time to end this."

"我对你那原始的聒噪感到厌倦了，莉莉姆。" 她母亲傲慢地说道，"是时候结束这一切了。"

A new violence entered the assaults on Asuka senses as the Angel poured more energy into overwhelming the girl. Asuka screwed her eyes up and held back against the tide of pain attempting to violate her soul. As it grew nearer to engulfing her she felt her will becoming weaker, she knew that she would not be able to resist the Angel's onslaught for too much longer. "Wondergirl…" She whispered desperately. In that moment she felt the presence of another enter her. At that same moment she also felt that she gained a new strength to resist. It was like another will held her in its grasp. Instead of the foreign and harsh presence of the attacking Angel, this new sensation had a familiar feel to it. While grateful for its sudden intrusion into her losing battle with the violation of the Angel, she couldn't help but feel there was something faintly smug and annoying about this new presence.

新的暴力侵袭着明日香的感官，天使倾注更多能量试图压倒这个女孩。明日香紧闭双眼，竭力抵抗着试图侵犯她灵魂的痛苦浪潮。随着痛苦逼近将她吞没，她感到自己的意志正在减弱，她知道无法长久抵抗天使的猛攻。“奇迹女孩……”她绝望地低语。就在那一刻，她感觉到另一个存在进入了她。与此同时，她也感到自己获得了新的抵抗力量。仿佛另一个意志紧紧抓住了她。与攻击天使那股陌生而严酷的存在不同，这种新感觉带有熟悉的气息。尽管感激这突如其来的介入，让她在与天使侵犯的败局中得以喘息，但她不禁觉得这新存在有些微妙的自得和恼人。

Asuka grinned at her new found sense of power. "About fucking time, Wondergirl!" She snarled with a new-found ferocity.

明日香对着她新发现的权力感咧嘴一笑。“终于他妈的来了，奇迹女孩！”她带着新获得的凶猛咆哮道。

With this power she used her will to push the other back from her body. Her eyes glowed red as the Angel retreated from her, a small hexagonal shield appearing before her, pushing the tendrils and pain away from her body.

凭借这股力量，她运用意志将对方从自己身体推开。当天使退却时，她的双眼闪烁着红光，一个小小的六边形护盾出现在她面前，将触须和痛苦从她身体驱散。

"This is the light of my soul!" Asuka said in a voice that was no longer her own. "You shall not pass!"

"这是我灵魂的光芒！"明日香用一种不再是她自己的声音说道，"你休想通过！"

"Arrogant Child. You dare to talk of things you cannot comprehend!"

傲慢的小孩，你竟敢谈论那些你无法理解的事情！

"This is the light of my soul!" The voice that was not Asuka's repeated. "You shall not pass!"

"这是我灵魂的光芒！" 那并非明日香的声音重复道。"你休想通过！"

"Oh…" The Angel's voice said with some surprise and apparent annoyance as its attacks relented. "I see now that the whore is here too. I should not be surprised. I suppose in a way that it is fitting. It matters not anyway, for it is too late now. See how your lover dies at your own hands."

"哦…"天使的声音带着几分惊讶和明显的恼怒说道，随着它的攻击停歇。"我现在明白了，那个妓女也在这里。我本不该感到惊讶。从某种程度上说，这倒也合适。不过，现在说什么都晚了。看看你的爱人如何死在你的手上吧。"

Without transition Asuka was sitting back in the entry plug of Unit 03. She was still wearing her plug suit, which was whole and undamaged.

没有过渡，明日香已经坐在了三号机的插入栓内。她仍然穿着完好无损的插入服。

She could see from the cockpit Unit 01 in front of her, the long black arms of Unit 03 clamped around its neck, the thick strong fingers deforming the armour with the force of the pressure that they were exerting.

她从面前的零号机驾驶舱中可以看到，三号机那长长的黑色双臂紧紧箍在零号机的脖子上，粗壮有力的手指因施加的压力而使装甲变形。

Vainly she heaved and pounded on the control yokes in a futile attempt to wrest control of the Eva away from the Angel. Still the fingers dug into the throat of Unit 01. Sickeningly she could feel the flesh and armour of the purple Eva giving way as if it were her own hands doing the strangling.

她徒劳地用力摇晃并猛击控制杆，试图从使徒手中夺回 Eva 的控制权，但无济于事。那手指依旧紧紧掐住零号机的喉咙。她感到一阵恶心，仿佛是自己亲手在扼杀那紫色 Eva 的肉体与装甲。

"Shinji!" Asuka screamed, attempting to use the communication channel. "Shinji, can you hear me?"

"真嗣！"明日香尖叫着，试图使用通讯频道。"真嗣，你能听见我吗？"

Static was her only reply.

她唯一的回应是静电干扰声。

"Shinji! Answer me, dammit!"

"真嗣！回答我，该死的！"

She almost squealed with joy when she heard the faint and crackling reply. "A-Asuka? Are you in there!"

当她听到那微弱而噼啪作响的回应时，差点高兴得尖叫起来。“是明日香吗？你在里面吗！”

"Shinji…" She said. "I'm sorry to have to do this to you! I need you to fight back! Don't let them take control of the Eva away from you!"

"真嗣…" 她说道，"很抱歉必须这样对你！我需要你反击！不要让他们从你手中夺走 Eva 的控制权！"

"But, Asuka. I don't want to hurt you!"

但是，明日香，我不想伤害你！

"Don't worry about me Shinji!" Asuka replied. "I need you to get this thing as far away from the people down there as possible! Then, when I give you the word, raise your A-T Field as strongly as you can! Can you do that for me?"

"别担心我，真嗣！"明日香回答道，"我需要你把这东西尽可能远离下面的人群！然后，当我给你信号时，尽你所能地增强你的 A-T 力场！你能为我做到吗？"

"B-But Asuka…" "但...但是，明日香…"

"Please, Shinji?" She pleaded.

"求你了，真嗣？" 她恳求道。

"Okay!" 好的！

Asuka watched as Unit 01 raised its arms and began pulling the hands of Unit 03 away from its neck. It only took a couple of seconds for the black Eva's hold to be broken. Asuka felt a stinging pain in her hands as Unit 03's were wrenched away from their stranglehold.

明日香注视着，零号机举起双臂，开始将三号机的双手从其颈部拉开。仅用了几秒钟，黑色使徒的束缚便被打破。当三号机的手被强行从勒颈处扯开时，明日香感到双手一阵刺痛。

"Atta boy, Shinji!" She yelled in encouragement. She could feel the Angel trying to get to her to stop her interference, but a force was holding it back, preventing it from getting to her. Emboldened she wrenched at the control yokes. Disappointingly she wasn't able to wrest control of Unit 03 away from the Angel, but she was able to impede its progress just a little. The black Eva moved awkwardly now as it attempted to counter Unit 01's attacks on it. Each carefully timed move from the purple Evangelion was designed to move them both as far away as possible from populated areas where people might be put in danger. Through the pain transmitted to her from the rogue Eva, Asuka couldn't help but be impressed by the skill that Shinji showed, and having an Angel's eye view of the battle was strangely exhilarating, if not a little terrifying.

"加油，真嗣！" 她大声鼓励道。她能感觉到使徒正试图接近她，以阻止她的干预，但有一股力量在阻挡它，使其无法靠近。受到鼓舞，她猛地拉扯控制杆。遗憾的是，她未能从使徒手中夺回三号机的控制权，但她确实稍微阻碍了它的行动。黑色的机体在试图应对初号机的攻击时显得笨拙。紫色使徒的每一次精心策划的动作，都是为了让两者尽可能远离人口密集区，以免危及无辜。尽管从失控的机体传来的痛苦让明日香难以忍受，但她仍不禁对真嗣展现出的技巧感到钦佩，而从使徒的视角观察这场战斗，既令人兴奋又略带恐怖。

When she judged that the timing was right she yelled out. "Shinji, get back!"

当她判断时机成熟时，她大声喊道：“真嗣，快回来！”

She watched with some satisfaction as Unit 01 retreated about 20 metres from where she still struggled for control of Unit 03.

她带着几分满意地看着，零号机从她仍在为控制三号机而挣扎的地方后退了大约 20 米。

"A-T Field up now, Shinji!"

现在启动 A-T 力场，真嗣！

Seeing Unit 01 step further back and raise its field, Asuka quickly clambered over to the back of the cockpit. Flipping open a red panel at the rear of the pilot's seat, she twisted and pulled the D handle up with all of her might.

目睹零号机后退一步并提升其场域，明日香迅速攀爬至驾驶舱后方。她翻开驾驶员座椅后部的一个红色面板，用尽全力扭转并拉起 D 型把手。

"Unit 03 has initiated its self-destruct protocol." Aoba said in a stunned voice.

"Unit 03 已启动自毁程序。" 青叶震惊地说道。

There were gasps from the other members of the bridge crew around him.

他周围的桥楼船员中传来了阵阵惊呼声。

Up on the command bridge above them the Sub Commander spoke quietly to his former pupil.

在他们上方的指挥桥上，潜艇指挥官轻声与他的昔日学生交谈。

"Is this what you wanted, Ikari?"

"这就是你想要的吗，碇？"

Gendo just let an imperceptible smirk show. "It will suffice as well as any other." He answered. "The Second is stronger than we gave her credit for. She may yet prove useful to us, if she lives."

源渡只是让一丝难以察觉的微笑浮现。“这和其他任何一样足够了。”他回答道，“第二适格者比我们预想的要强。如果她能活下来，或许还能对我们有用。”

Fuyutsuki chewed his lower lip as he watched the battle play out on the giant screen in Central Dogma.

冬月一边咬着下唇，一边注视着中央教条巨大屏幕上展开的战斗。

Shinji watched in horror as the black Evangelion writhed and clawed at the earth as if it was in the grip of madness. The feeling of impotence he felt in not being able to help Asuka, as she fought desperately to save herself, gripped his heart with agonizing pain. It had nearly broken him to have to fight against Unit 03, knowing that she was inside. With as much care and skill as he could manage while still fighting off the now clumsy attacks of Unit 03, Shinji pushed the infected unit away from the support teams and the farmsteads that dotted the area.

真嗣惊恐地看着那黑色的福音战士在地上扭曲挣扎，疯狂地抓挠着地面。他感到无能为力，无法帮助正在拼命自救的明日香，这种感觉紧紧攫住了他的心，带来剧烈的痛苦。他几乎崩溃，不得不与内部有她的三号机作战。尽管如此，真嗣还是竭尽所能，小心翼翼地运用技巧，同时抵挡着三号机那笨拙的攻击，将受感染的机体推离支援团队和散布在周围的农庄。

He wanted so much to save her. To be the one who protected the only person he had allowed so close to him since he was four years old from harm. To spare her the horrors that he knew she must be experiencing inside Unit 03. He would have given his life to be in that Evangelion instead of her.

他多么渴望能救她。成为那个保护自四岁起唯一一个被他允许如此亲近的人免受伤害的人。让她免受他知道她一定在 03 号单位内经历的恐怖。他宁愿用自己的生命去换取在那台福音战士里的是他而不是她。

"Shinji, get back!" He had heard Asuka scream over the sound only channel.

"真嗣，回来！" 他在仅有的声音通道中听到了明日香的尖叫。

Without hesitation he stopped Unit 01 and moved back about twenty metres from the other Eva. His chest heaved painfully as he watched the continued struggling of the black Eva. In his mind he went back to the previous night that they had spent together. To the feeling of helplessness he had at the obvious pain that Asuka had felt. The desperation of the girl as she had kissed him and held him close in the dark of her bedroom. He clenched his fist. He was not going to let Asuka be harmed. He would rather die first.

他毫不犹豫地停下了初号机，向后退了大约二十米，远离了另一台 Eva。看着黑色 Eva 继续挣扎，他的胸口因紧张而剧烈起伏。脑海中回想起前一晚他们共度的时光，感受到明日香明显的痛苦时自己的无助。在她的卧室里，黑暗中，女孩绝望地吻他、紧紧抱住他的情景历历在目。他紧握拳头，决不让明日香受到伤害，宁愿自己先死。

The alarmed voice of Lieutenant Aoba crackled over the comm.

青叶中尉惊慌的声音在通讯中噼啪作响。

"Unit 03 has initiated its self-destruct protocol!"

"Unit 03 已启动自毁协议！"

Shinji's heart dropped into the pit of his stomach.

真嗣的心沉到了胃底。

"Asuka!" The boy screamed.

"明日香！" 男孩尖叫道。

Asuka wrenched again on the eject mechanism, the sound of gears groaning under the strain of trying to expel the plug from the back of the Evangelion sounding all around her. It seemed that the armoured plates protecting the back and neck of the Unit were seized shut by some kind of tarry substance. She could feel the Angel trying to claw her back into itself, so that she might die with it.

明日香再次猛拉弹射机制，四周回荡着齿轮因试图将插入栓从福音战士背部排出而发出的呻吟声。似乎保护机身后颈部的装甲板被某种粘稠物质卡住了。她能感觉到使徒正试图将她拖回其体内，以便与之同归于尽。

"No dice, bitch!" She cried. "I am outta here!"

"没门，贱人！" 她喊道，"我走了！"

Unfortunately, it seemed her words were overly optimistic. No matter how hard she pulled at the lever the Plug was firmly stuck.

不幸的是，她的言辞似乎过于乐观了。无论她如何用力拉杠杆，插头都牢牢地卡住了。

"Shit!" "该死！"

"Asuka!" Shinji's voice crackled over the comm.

"明日香！" 真嗣的声音在通讯中噼啪作响。

"Shinji!" Asuka screamed back. "Get your A-T Field up, goddamn it!"

"真嗣！"明日香回喊道，"快展开你的 A-T 力场，该死的！"

Instead she suddenly felt Unit 03 lurch and she was thrown from her seat as the Eva suddenly lurched over and was thrown face down onto the ground.

然而，她突然感觉到 03 号机猛地一晃，自己被从座位上甩了出去，而那台 Eva 也突然倾斜，面朝下重重地摔在地上。

"Shinji! What are you doing, idiot?"

真嗣！你在干什么，笨蛋？

There was no reply but the sound of armour plating being wrenched from the back of the Eva.

没有回应，只有 EVA 背部装甲板被撕扯的声音。

The bridge crew watched in a mixture of horror and amazement as Unit 01 flipped the still struggling, though mortally wounded, Unit 03 over. It then pinned the struggling unit down on the ground with its knees. As they watched the purple Evangelion drew its progressive knife and stabbed precisely down into the upper back of the black Unit.

桥上的船员们带着惊恐与惊叹交织的心情，目睹着零号机将仍在挣扎却已命悬一线的三号机翻转过来。随后，它用膝盖将挣扎中的机体牢牢压在地面上。就在他们注视之下，那台紫色的福音战士抽出其高振动粒子刀，精准地刺入黑色机体的背部上方。

Unit 01 then wrenched the back plates of armour off with brute force. The cameras showed that the plug was partially ejected, though still held in place by the strange blue tarry substance that oozed from the back of Unit 03.

随后，单元 01 凭借蛮力强行拆下了装甲背板。摄像头显示，插头已被部分弹出，但仍被从单元 03 背部渗出的奇异蓝色粘稠物质固定在原位。

The small rocket motors around the top of the plug fired, forcing the cylinder just a little further out from the back armour. Unit 01 grabbed the plug with both hands and with sheer force pulled the long white tube out of the gore.

插头顶部的小火箭发动机点火，迫使圆柱体略微从后装甲中伸出。初号机双手紧握插头，凭借纯粹的力量将那根长长的白色管子从血腥中拔出。

Clutching the plug to itself, Unit 01 then drew back from the rogue Evangelion and hunched over with its back to it, at the same time raising it's A-T Field to maximum.

零号机紧握着插头，随后从失控的福音战士身边退开，背对着它弯下腰，同时将自身的 A-T 力场提升至最大强度。

"Unit 03's core has reached critical!" Aoba called out.

"Unit 03 的核心已经达到临界状态！" 青叶呼喊道。

Within a less than a second almost all of the surrounding countryside for 300 metres was obliterated in an enormous explosion as Unit 03's core collapsed in on itself and vaporised the black Evangelion almost completely. The screen in Central Dogma went offline as the sensors were either knocked out or destroyed in the blast.

在不到一秒的时间里，随着 03 号机核心的坍塌并几乎完全蒸发黑色福音机，周围 300 米范围内的乡村几乎全部在一场巨大的爆炸中被夷为平地。与此同时，中央教条的屏幕因传感器在爆炸中被摧毁或失效而断线。

Quickly the visual feed was re-established using a camera on a NERV satellite in orbit above Japan. Zooming in on ground zero, no trace of Unit 03 could be seen in the blasted landscape around where it had died but for a thick column of bloodshot smoke.

很快，通过位于日本上空的一颗 NERV 卫星上的摄像头，视觉信号得以重新建立。镜头拉近至地面零点，在那片被炸毁的地貌中，已不见零号机的踪迹，唯有一柱浓重的血色烟雾升腾。

A short distance away Unit 01 still sat, hunched over and only lightly damaged, while still cradling Unit 03's entry plug almost tenderly in its arms.

不远处，零号机依旧坐着，身体微弯，仅受轻伤，同时温柔地怀抱着三号机的插入栓。

In the flashing strobes of the emergency crews it took him a few seconds to recognise her.

在紧急救援队闪烁的灯光下，他花了好几秒才认出她来。

"Katsuragi!" He called out.

"葛城！" 他喊道。

She looked up, her eyes red and tired. "Kaji?"

她抬起头，双眼红肿而疲惫。“卡吉？”

Overcome with relief he rushed over and enveloped her in a tight bear-hug. "I'm so glad that you got out!"

他如释重负，急忙冲过去，紧紧地给了她一个熊抱。“你逃出来了，我真是太高兴了！”

"Oof!" Misato grunted at the impact. "Oww… my arm!"

"哎哟！" 真嗣在撞击下哼了一声。"哎呀…我的胳膊！"

"Uh… sorry, Misato." Kaji said sheepishly.

"呃……对不起，葛城小姐。" 加持尴尬地说道。

"That's okay, you oaf!" Misato said with a smile.

"没关系，你这个笨蛋！" 葛城美里笑着说。

"Are you okay?" Kaji said worriedly looking at her heavily bandaged left arm. "You're hurt?"

"你还好吗？" 加濑担心地看着她左臂上厚厚的绷带问道，"你受伤了？"

"Yeah, I'm surprised that I made it out with just a banged-up arm." Misato replied, gesturing to her bandaged limb. "Fourteen of the cage crew weren't so lucky."

"是啊，我也很惊讶自己只是手臂受了点伤就逃出来了。" 三佐回答道，指了指自己包扎着的手臂。"笼子组的十四个人就没那么幸运了。"

"I know…" Kaji replied. "Still, we were lucky that we got off so lightly with this one."

"我知道……" 卡吉回答道，"尽管如此，我们这次能这么轻易脱身，也算是幸运了。"

"Lightly?" Misato said incredulously. "Fourteen people are dead, one Eva is totally destroyed, another one crippled. Not to mention how many people have been hospitalised. Plus there's a shiny new crater for the ordinance surveyors to write me yet more angry letters about!"

"轻描淡写？" 美里难以置信地说道，"十四人丧生，一台 Eva 彻底毁坏，另一台严重受损。更别提有多少人因此住院。再加上，又多了一个闪亮的新坑，让那些测绘员又有理由给我写更多愤怒的信了！"

"Yeah… but at least the Angel was destroyed, and the kids are all in one piece."

是啊……但至少那个天使被摧毁了，孩子们也都安然无恙。

Misato's eyes took on a new shine. "How are they? How's Asuka? How's Shinji taking it?"

美里眼中闪烁着新的光芒。“他们怎么样了？明日香怎么样？真嗣怎么应对的？”

"Yeah.. well.. Shinji's under confinement at the moment. Seems there was another clash of wills between father and son during the battle."

是啊，呃，真嗣目前被关禁闭了。好像在战斗中父子之间又发生了意志的冲突。

"What?" Misato asked worriedly. "That's the first anyone's told me about this! What happened?"

"什么？" 美里担心地问道，"这是第一次有人告诉我这件事！发生了什么？"

The pony tailed man looked around him nervously. "I can say too much here! Too many eyes and ears." He whispered.

扎着马尾的男人紧张地环顾四周，低声说道：“这里我不能说太多！眼目耳目太多了。”

Misato also glanced around as if expecting men in trench coats to be loitering nearby. "O-Okay." She said. "What about Asuka? Was she hurt?"

碇真嗣也环顾四周，仿佛期待着附近有穿着风衣的男人在徘徊。“好-好的。”她说。“那明日香呢？她受伤了吗？”

"I only got to see her briefly afterwards as they were putting her in an ambulance. She was pretty heavily sedated, but the paramedic told me that she wasn't too badly injured. Just 'Banged up a bit' in his words."

后来我只在他们将她抬上救护车时匆匆见了一面。她被注射了大量镇静剂，但急救人员告诉我她伤得并不严重，只是“有点磕碰”，这是他的原话。

"Thank god!" Misato sighed in relief. "Though what her mind will be like after an experience like that god only knows!"

"谢天谢地！" 葛城美里松了一口气。"不过经历了那种事之后，她的心理状态会变成什么样，只有天知道了！"

Kaji smiled. "She's a tough kid. I think that she'll be okay."

加治微笑着说：“她是个坚强的孩子，我想她会没事的。”

"Yeah, she's a good kid."

是的，她是个好孩子。

"I hear that she's taken a bit of a shine to young Shinji? Poor boy's going to need to keep his wits about him to keep up with that one."

听说她对小真嗣有点儿意思了？可怜的孩子得保持机智才能跟上她的节奏。

"Yeah… about Asuka…" Misato said.

"嗯……关于明日香……" 美里说道。

"What about her?" 她怎么了？

"You know how she's been acting a little oddly lately."

你知道她最近行为有点古怪。

"Yeah." Kaji answered. "It could just be youthful angst. I think my line of work makes me a little paranoid sometimes. I was probably reading too much into what she said."

"嗯。" 卡吉回答道，"可能只是年轻人的焦虑吧。我觉得我的工作有时让我有点多疑。我可能过度解读了她的话。"

"I don't think so…" Misato said quietly. "She seemed to have some kind of premonition about what was going to happen today… It was really weird."

"我不这么认为……" 美里轻声说道，"她似乎预感到了今天会发生什么……真的很奇怪。"

"Premonition?" Kaji replied in confusion. "Like ESP?"

"预感？" 卡吉困惑地回答，"像是超感知觉那种吗？"

"I don't know." Misato looked around her again. "Look… I'll talk to you about this later."

"我不知道。" 碇真嗣再次环顾四周，"听着…我晚点再跟你谈这个。"

"Sure." Kaji replied uncertainly. "So… How's Akagi?"

"当然。" 薰不确定地回答道，"那么……赤木怎么样了？"

"Ritsuko? Fine… I guess. She got off more lightly than I did physically. Though mentally she seems to be taking it a lot harder."

"律子？还好吧……我想。她身体上受到的影响比我轻。但心理上似乎承受得更为沉重。"

"What do you mean?"

你是什么意思？

In the back of one of the portable situation vans about twenty metres from where the two former lovers were discussing the fallout from that day's disaster, a blonde figure in a lab coat with a heavily bandaged forehead sat with her laptop in front of her.

在距离两位昔日恋人讨论当天灾难余波约二十米的一辆便携式现场指挥车后部，一位额头缠着厚厚绷带的穿着实验室白大褂的金发女子正坐在她的笔记本电脑前。

Ritsuko Akagi's eyes widened as she analysed the data she had streamed from the MAGI back at Central Dogma to her personal access point. She wiped her face to clear the hot tears from her cheeks as the incontrovertible realisation that the figures on the screen were telling her.

赤木律子的眼睛因分析从中央教条的 MAGI 传输到她的个人接入点的数据而睁大。她擦去脸上的热泪，屏幕上的数字无可辩驳地告诉她真相。

"He knew… He knew that this was going to happen…." The broken woman whispered over and over to herself. "He knew and he sent me here to die…"

他知道……他知道这一切会发生……”那位破碎的女子一遍遍地对自己低语。“他知道，他把我送到这里来送死……”

End Chapter 11 结束第 11 章

Hope that you enjoyed Chapter 11 of Unbroken. I can't be too sure how long it will take to get Chapter 12 up and posted. Between some long delayed study and travel coming up in the next little while, it may take a little longer to write. Then again... I think that time has well and truly shown that I suck at predicting when my next update will come.

希望您喜欢《Unbroken》的第 11 章。我不太确定第 12 章需要多久才能发布。接下来一段时间，由于一些延迟已久的学习和旅行计划，写作可能会慢一些。不过，时间已经充分证明，我实在不擅长预测下一次更新的时间。

So... Watch this space I guess!

所以...我想就敬请期待吧！

Chapter Twelve: 第十二章：

Winter's Threshold 冬日的门槛

She hated this place. 她讨厌这个地方。

It wasn't the reek of cheap ramen and stale beer that saturated the night air. Nor was it the buzzing, garish lights that assaulted the surrounding darkness. It wasn't the unending cacophony of electronic beeps and squeaks from the pachinko parlours as the balls rattled around their pegs. It wasn't even the sounds of off-key karaoke that drifted out of several nearby bars.

并非是廉价拉面和陈年啤酒的刺鼻气味弥漫在夜空中，也不是那炫目的灯光侵袭着周围的黑暗。并非是弹珠机店中电子哔哔声和尖叫声不绝于耳，弹珠在钉子间跳跃的嘈杂。甚至不是附近几家酒吧飘出的走调卡拉 OK 声。

Over the last few years she had become more familiar with this end of town than she ever had wanted to be. It represented so much to her than just the seedy end of town full of drink sodden salarymen and the buzzing brightness of so many gaming parlours crammed into Old Hakone's small commercial district.

过去几年里，她对这片城区的熟悉程度已远超她所愿。这里对她而言，不仅仅是充斥着醉醺醺的上班族和众多游戏厅挤在老箱根狭小商业区的肮脏地带，它代表着更多。

Hikari Horaki hated it with every fibre of her being. She hated it with more passion than those who knew her would have suspected that the quiet, well mannered, girl ever possessed.

堀木光讨厌它到了极点，这种厌恶之情比那些了解她的人所猜测的还要强烈，他们从未想到这个文静、有礼貌的女孩会拥有如此强烈的情感。

It represented to her the loss of her old life. Of her feeling happy and feeling safe. A life before the weight of responsibility had fallen so heavily upon the middle girl of the Horaki family. A life where Jun Horaki had been the devoted and proud father of three young girls as well as the loving husband to a seemingly ever smiling wife and mother to Kodama, Nozomi and herself.

对她来说，这代表着她旧生活的丧失，失去了快乐和安全感。那是责任的重担还未如此沉重地压在堀木家三个女儿中的老二身上的生活。在那之前，堀木纯一直是三个小女孩的慈爱而自豪的父亲，也是对笑容似乎永远挂在脸上的妻子和母亲——儿玉、望美和她自己——深爱的丈夫。

A life that would never have involved her standing alone and nervous, late at night, in the seedy end of town. That would never have involved her waiting for her father to finish his game and come home so that she could feed him the reheated dinner that she had cooked for herself and her sisters over three hours earlier.

一个本不会让她在深夜独自紧张地站在城市破败地带的生活。一个本不会让她等待父亲结束牌局回家，以便她能给他端上早已为自己和姐妹们准备并重新加热了三个多小时的晚餐的生活。

A life that had died nearly four years ago.

一个几乎四年前就已逝去的生活。

That one lab accident had left a larger hole in her young world than just the loss of the vibrant, loving mother of three young girls.

那次实验室事故不仅让三个小女孩失去了充满活力、慈爱的母亲，还在她年轻的生命中留下了一个更大的空洞。

"Hello, little lady!" 你好，小姑娘！

Hikari squeaked and spun around to face the owner of the slurring, beer sodden voice. Between her and the pachinko parlour that her father frequented was the reeking, drunken figure of an overweight middle-aged salaryman. His half-finished plastic cup of beer sloshing around carelessly in his hand.

光尖叫一声，转身面对那个含糊不清、满口啤酒味的声音的主人。在她和她父亲常去的弹珠机店之间，站着一个散发着酒臭味的、醉醺醺的中年肥胖上班族。他手里那半满的塑料杯啤酒随意晃动着。

"Wh-what's a pretty little thing like you doing here?" He continued with a drunken leer.

"你、你这样的小美人在这里做什么？"他继续带着醉意淫笑道。

"I-I'm w-waiting for my Papa…" She stammered nervously. 'Why does this always happen?' "H-He'll be here in a minute… sorry!"

我-我在等我爸爸…" 她紧张地结巴着。'为什么这种事总是发生？' "他-他马上就到…对不起！

The shabby, grey-suited man seemed not to hear her. He stepped closer to where Hikari stood and grabbed hold of her arm roughly.

那个穿着破旧灰西装的男人似乎没听见她的话。他走近站在那里的 Hikari，粗暴地抓住了她的手臂。

"Please…" She begged, pulling her arm out of his grip. "My Papa will be here really soon…"

"求你了…" 她哀求着，从他的紧握中抽出自己的手臂。"我爸爸真的很快就会到这里…"

"Will he…" The man said with a creepy leer. "I'm sure that your 'Papa' won't begrudge you spending a little time with me now, will he?" The man continued. "I'll make it worth your while…"

"他会……"那人带着诡异的笑容说道，"我确信你的'爸爸'不会介意你现在花点时间陪我，对吧？"他接着说，"我会让你觉得值得的……"

"What?" Hikari replied in shock. "No! Please leave me alone!"

"什么？" 光震惊地回答，"不！请别打扰我！"

"Come on now… Don't be like that…" He said, raising his hands placatingly.

“好了好了，别这样……” 他说着，举起双手以示安抚。

Across the way Shinji Ikari stood watching his school friend struggle with the drunken man. He shifted his backpack uncomfortably on his shoulders. The last thing he wanted right then was to bring any kind of attention upon himself. He had come here, to the seedy entertainment district of Old Hakone, for the sense of escape that could only be found in a crowd. Over time he had come to know that there was nowhere more anonymous or alone as being in a large group of people that you didn't belong to.

在对面的新治碇真嗣站在那里，目睹着他的同学与醉酒男子纠缠。他不安地调整着肩上的背包。那时，他最不希望的就是引起任何人的注意。他来到这里，旧箱根的肮脏娱乐区，是为了在人群中寻找那种仅有的逃避感。随着时间的推移，他逐渐明白，没有比身处一群与自己无关的大众中更匿名或孤独的地方了。

He had spotted Hikari not long before the man had started bothering her. What a proper young lady like her was doing out in this end of town at night he couldn't even imagine. He was too heartsick and tired to care right at that moment anyway. Even when she had started to receive the unwanted attention of the salaryman he had just thought that the she would be able to see him off without too much trouble. She was the Class Representative after all. She always spoke with authority.

他不久前才注意到光，而那名男子开始骚扰她。他实在无法想象，像她这样端庄的年轻女士，晚上怎么会出现在城郊这一带。那一刻，他心力交瘁，无暇顾及。即便她开始受到那位上班族的纠缠，他也只是认为，作为班长的她，总能轻易将对方打发走。她向来言辞有力，充满权威。

After just a few more seconds he realised that the man wasn't going to stop harassing Hikari. The passing crowd of people didn't give the older talking to the teenager a second glance as they bustled by. Even from where he stood Shinji could tell from her body language that Hikari was becoming scared.

仅仅几秒钟后，他意识到那个男人不会停止骚扰光。匆匆而过的人群对这位年长者与青少年的交谈并未多看一眼。即便站在远处，真嗣也能从光的身体语言中察觉到她正变得害怕。

"Shit." He muttered quietly to himself before shouldering his bag and beginning to walk across the street towards to two of them.

"该死。" 他低声自语，随后背起背包，开始穿过街道向他们两人走去。

"…my Papa is just inside." Hikari was saying. "He'll be out here really soon!"

"…我爸爸就在里面。"光说道，"他很快就会出来的！"

"He's not here yet." The man replied with a snarl. "Why don't you stop being so frigid and…"

"他还没到。" 那人咆哮着回答，"你怎么就不能别那么冷淡，还……"

"Excuse me, sir." 打扰一下，先生。

They both spun around to see Shinji Ikari standing before them, his face unreadable in the neon glow of the surrounding lights.

他们俩同时转身，只见碇真嗣站在他们面前，周围霓虹灯的光芒下，他的表情难以捉摸。

"Fuck off, kid." The man slurred. "I'm busy."

"滚开，小孩。" 那人含糊地说，"我很忙。"

Shinji swallowed hard. The man was a lot bigger than him, and had obviously been drinking heavily. He was out of his depth here and he knew it. From behind the man, though, he could see Hikari looking at him. Her eyes shining brightly at him with hope in the neon glow.

真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。那男人比他高大得多，显然喝了不少酒。他知道自己处境不妙。然而，从那男人身后，他能看到光正望着他。她的眼睛在霓虹灯的映照下闪烁着希望的光芒。

"My friend doesn't want to talk to you, sir." He said. "Why don't you go to that bar back there, have a couple more drinks and forget that you ever saw her?"

“我的朋友不想和你说话，先生。”他说道，“你何不回到那边的酒吧，再喝几杯，然后忘了你曾见过她呢？”

"I said, fuck off!" He was yelling now. People were skirting by them, leaving enough space so as not to get involved, surreptitiously watching the confrontation out of the corners of their eyes.

我喊道：“滚开！”他现在正大声叫嚷。人们绕着他们走，留出足够的空间以免卷入其中，偷偷地用眼角观察这场对峙。

"No." Shinji replied more firmly. "My friend and I will be leaving. Without you."

"不。" 真嗣更加坚定地回答，"我和我的朋友将要离开。没有你。"

"Cocky little bastard!" The man yelled, pushing Shinji hard in the chest. The boy stumbled but kept his feet, his months of training kicking in as he ducked a flying hay-maker, dodged another lunge by the drunk and came in close enough to bring his knee up into the man's crotch with all of the force he could muster. The suited man dropped instantly to the ground with a strangled grunt.

"狂妄的小混蛋！" 那人吼叫着，用力推了真嗣的胸口一把。男孩踉跄了一下，但稳住了脚步，数月的训练此刻发挥了作用，他低头躲过一记飞来的重拳，又避开了醉汉的又一次扑击，趁机贴近，用尽全力将膝盖顶向那人的胯部。西装男顿时痛苦地呻吟一声，倒在了地上。

All was silent around him. Only the unending ping and rattle of the pachinko machines filling the night air as the people around them stood quiet and still at the spectacle of the slight teenager felling the hefty salaryman so quickly.

周围一片寂静。只有柏青哥机不间断的叮当声充斥着夜空，人们围绕着他们静静地站着，目睹着那个瘦弱的少年如此迅速地击倒了魁梧的上班族，场面令人惊叹。

"Arrrgh… You little shit!" The man gasped in pain as he struggled up from the pavement. "I'll fucking kill you!"

"啊……你这个小混蛋！" 男人痛苦地喘息着，从人行道上挣扎着站起来。"我要宰了你！"

"I wouldn't try it." Shinji replied, holding his cell-phone in his hand. "There are at least a dozen Section 2 men within 300 metres of us here. I press this red button on my phone and they'll come running."

"我不会尝试的。" 真嗣回答道，手里握着手机，"在我们周围 300 米内，至少有十几名第二部门的特工。我只要按下手机上的这个红色按钮，他们就会立刻赶来。"

"S-Section 2?" The man replied nervously. All Tokyo-03 knew the reputation of NERV's secret police. "You're one of those NERV brats?"

"S-Section 2?" 男人紧张地回答。整个东京-03 都知道 NERV 秘密警察的名声。"你是那些 NERV 的小鬼之一吗？"

"That's right." Shinji replied more confidently. "Think of what might happen to your family if you just disappeared?"

"没错。" 真嗣更加自信地回答道，"想想如果你就这样消失了，你的家人会怎样？"

The man winced as he walked towards them, his hands out. "I was just having a little fun with the young lady, that's all!" He pleaded. "You know that!"

男子走向他们时皱了皱眉，双手伸出。“我只是和那位小姐开了个小玩笑，仅此而已！”他恳求道，“你们知道的！”

As quickly as it had stopped, the noise and hubbub began again around them as the crowd, sensing that their entertainment was over, resumed its usual level of activity.

噪音和喧嚣如同之前戛然而止般迅速再次围绕着他们响起，人群察觉到娱乐已结束，便恢复了往常的活动水平。

"Please, don't call Section 2!" He pleaded again. "I'll do whatever you want!"

“求你了，别叫第二区！”他再次恳求道，“你让我做什么都行！”

"Just leave." Shinji answered.

“那就走吧。” 真嗣回答道。

"Y-Yes, sir… Right away!"

"是，先生… 马上就来！"

The man staggered off and was swallowed up into the thronging crowd in an instant. Leaving Shinji and Hikari standing awkwardly together under the streetlight.

那人踉跄着离开，瞬间被熙熙攘攘的人群吞没。留下真嗣和光在路灯下尴尬地站在一起。

"A-Are you okay, Miss Horaki?" Shinji asked, exhaling heavily.

"你还好吗，洞木小姐？" 真嗣问道，重重地呼出一口气。

Hikari took a deep, shuddering breath and looked over at the young man next to her. "Hikari, please. And, yes, Shinji. Thanks to you I am!"

光深吸了一口气，身体微微颤抖，然后转头看向身边的年轻人。“我是光，是的，真嗣。多亏了你，我才能这样！”

She could see his faint blush even under the streetlights. "Anyone would have done it…" He said shyly.

即使在路灯下，她也能看到他微微泛红的脸颊。“任何人都会这么做的……”他腼腆地说。

"I don't think so; there are at least two hundred people on this street. Not even one of them said or did a thing! Only you, Shinji! Only you came to save the day!"

我不这么认为；这条街上至少有两百人。他们中没有一个人说过或做过任何事！只有你，真嗣！只有你来拯救这一天！

"I-I shouldn't have threatened him… that was wrong!" Shinji said, bowing his head.

"我…我不该威胁他的…那是错的！" 真嗣说着，低下了头。

"Don't be so silly! If you hadn't, what would have happened to me?" Hikari replied. "Thank you, Shinji Ikari. Thank you for being my hero!"

"别这么傻了！如果你没有那样做，我会怎么样呢？" 光回答道。"谢谢你，碇真嗣。谢谢你成为我的英雄！"

"I'm not a hero…" 我不是英雄……

"You are to me, Shinji Ikari!" Hikari said, giving the boy a light kiss on the cheek.

"你对我来说，就是碇真嗣！" 光说道，并在男孩的脸颊上轻轻吻了一下。

"M-Miss Horaki!" Shinji said, flustered. "I-I…. I mean… uh… Thank you."

"洞木小姐！" 真嗣慌张地说，"我……我……我的意思是……呃……谢谢你。"

"No, thank you! You rescued me from that drunken pervert." She shuddered at the memory. "I was really scared for a few moments there. He was huge!"

"不，谢谢你！你把我从那个醉酒的变态手里救了出来。" 她回想起那一幕不禁打了个寒颤。"有那么一会儿我真的吓坏了。他块头好大！"

"He was, wasn't he?" Shinji replied as what he had done finally hit him. The teen crouched over, his hands resting on his knees. "I feel sick." He said

"他确实做了，不是吗？" 真嗣回答道，终于意识到自己所做的事。少年蹲下身，双手撑在膝盖上。"我感觉很难受。" 他说。

The pig-tailed girl looked at him and smiled. "I can see why Asuka likes you so much!" She said.

扎着马尾的女孩看着他，微笑着说：“我明白为什么明日香这么喜欢你了！”

The brown haired teen grimaced at the mention of the Second Child's name.

提到第二适格者的名字时，棕发少年皱起了眉头。

"What's wrong, Shinji?" Hikari asked.

"怎么了，真嗣？" 光问道。

"I-I don't think that Asuka will want to see me again…" Shinji stammered, straightening back up.

"我……我觉得明日香可能不会再想见我了……" 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，挺直了身子。

"Why ever not?" 为什么不行呢？

"I-In the last battle… She...She was hurt… the Angel. My fault…"

在上一场战斗中……她……她受伤了……那个天使。是我的错……

"Is Asuka okay?" "明日香还好吗？"

"I-I don't know." Shinji answered forlornly.

"我，我不知道。" 真嗣沮丧地回答。

"Did you hurt her on purpose?"

"你是故意伤害她的吗？"

"No." 翻译文本："不。"

"Did she say anything to blame you for it?"

她有没有为此事责怪你？

"No…" "不…"

"Have you even spoken to her?"

你跟她说过话吗？

Shinji just shook his head dumbly.

真嗣只是呆呆地摇了摇头。

"Why not?" Hikari demanded, more harshly than she meant to.

"为什么不呢？" 光质问道，语气比她本意要严厉。

The Third Child winced under her tone. "I can't face her… not after what happened. Not after I let her… after she was… hurt… I can't..." He trailed off.

三子在她严厉的语气下畏缩了。“我无法面对她……发生了那件事之后。在我让她……在她受到……伤害之后……我做不到……”他声音渐弱。

The Class Rep's face softened. "I'm sorry Shinji," She said. "After what you just did for me, I shouldn't be so hard on you."

班代表的脸色缓和了下来。“对不起，真嗣，”她说道，“你刚刚帮了我，我不该对你这么苛刻。”

"Th-That's okay." “没-没关系。”

"You do know that Asuka cares a lot about you, don't you?" She said. "Don't you think that maybe if you talked to her, maybe she might actually be okay about whatever happened?"

"你肯定知道明日香很在乎你，对吧？" 她说道，"你不觉得如果你跟她谈谈，或许她对发生的事情真的会释怀吗？"

Shinji shrugged. 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Call her, Shinji" Hikari continued. "Call her and you'll see that she'll be fine!"

"给她打电话，真嗣。" 光继续说道，"打给她，你就会看到她会没事的！"

"I-I can't…" "我……我做不到……"

"Please, Shinji!" "求你了，真嗣！"

"I…." Shinji's eyes were searching the area, as if he were looking for an escape. "I… I've gotta go!"

"我……" 真嗣的眼睛四处搜寻着，仿佛在寻找逃脱的路径。"我……我得走了！"

"Shinji! Don't run away!" But he was already backing away from her, his eyes no longer meeting hers.

"真嗣！别逃跑！" 但他已经在她面前退缩，目光不再与她交汇。

"See you Hikari…. Thanks!"

再见，光……谢谢你！

"Shinji…" "真嗣……"

He waved nervously at her before turning and walking away. Hikari's mouth twisted. 'Shinji Ikari.' She thought to herself. 'Slayer of Angels… terrified of people.'

他紧张地向她挥了挥手，然后转身离开。光的脸色一沉，心中默念：“碇真嗣，弑神者……却害怕与人相处。”

She watched him fade into the crowd. Once he was gone from view, she reached for her cell-phone and dialed.

她看着他消失在人群中。一旦他的身影从视线中消失，她便伸手拿起手机拨了电话。

"You going to nurse that cup of tea all night?"

你打算整晚都捧着那杯茶吗？

"Huh?" Shinji said, looking up. Staring down sternly at him was the middle-aged owner of the coffee shop where he had finally settled down in for the evening. He really had no plans beyond staying there, his back turned to the outside world. He would just sit there until the café closed. After that, he would have to figure out what to do with the rest of the night.

"嗯？" 真嗣抬头说道。严肃地俯视着他的是那家咖啡店的中年老板，他终于在那里安顿下来度过夜晚。他真的没有其他计划，只是背对着外面的世界坐在那里。他会一直坐到咖啡馆关门。之后，他得想办法打发剩下的夜晚。

"Sorry..." He mumbled to the lady, quickly finishing the cold dregs from his cup. "Could I have another please?"

"对不起..." 他低声对那位女士说道，迅速喝完了杯中冰冷的残渣。"能再给我来一杯吗？"

The lady's face softened. "Sure, honey." She answered, giving him a smile. "As you can see, I got no one else in here!"

女士的脸色柔和下来，“当然，亲爱的。”她回答道，给了他一个微笑，“你看，这里除了我可没别人了！”

"Sorry," Shinji said again. "If you want to close up I can move on…"

"Don't be silly!" She answered as she bustled over to the counter. "I gotta stay open for another hour anyway! Most of my best paying customers don't come in 'til eleven or so. Poor drunken souls. Thinking that a quick shot of coffee will wake them up and hide the smell of booze on their breath so that their wives won't know that they've been out drinking with their buddies all night!"

"别傻了！"她一边回答，一边忙碌地走向柜台，"反正我还得再营业一个小时呢！我那些出手阔绰的顾客大多要到十一点左右才来。可怜的醉鬼们，以为一杯速溶咖啡就能让他们清醒，掩盖住嘴里的酒味，好让老婆不知道他们整晚都和哥们儿在外面喝酒！"

"Oh…. Okay…" Shinji answered, thinking of the unpleasantness with the drunken salaryman from earlier in the evening. "Thanks, then."

"哦……好吧……" 真嗣回答道，脑海中浮现出傍晚时分与那位醉酒上班族的不愉快经历。"那谢谢了。"

"Not a problem, sweetie!" She said as she placed another steaming cup of tea on the table in front of him.

"没问题，亲爱的！" 她边说边在他面前放上另一杯热气腾腾的茶。

"Thank you." Shinji said as he went to fish some notes out of his pocket. The owner quickly waved him back.

"谢谢。" 新二说着，伸手去口袋里掏些钞票。店主连忙挥手让他停下。

"This one's on the house." She said with a warm smile.

“这杯我请客。”她带着温暖的微笑说道。

"Uh… Thanks…" "呃… 谢谢…"

She looked down at him appraisingly. "You look a little lost here, Honey." She said. "Don't you have a family to go home to?"

她低头审视着他，说道：“亲爱的，你看起来有点迷茫。你没有家可回吗？”

Shinji dropped his head. "No…"

真嗣低下了头。“不…”

"Sorry to hear that, Hon. Lots of people like you these days, though. Things are tough all over. Still, there must be someone out there who cares about you, nice kid like you?"

听到这个消息真遗憾，亲爱的。不过现在像你这样的人很多。到处都挺艰难的。尽管如此，肯定有人在乎你，像你这么好的孩子？

"There… there used to be… not anymore…"

那里……曾经有过……现在不再了……

"Hmm…" She said with an unreadable look. "Don't be so certain. I'm sure that somewhere there's a beautiful young lady who thinks the world of you!"

"嗯……" 她带着难以捉摸的表情说道，"别那么肯定。我确信，某个地方一定有位美丽的年轻女士对你评价极高！"

Shinji just shook his head.

真嗣只是摇了摇头。

"No… There's no-one." "不… 这里没有人。"

"I wouldn't be so sure of that." The café owner said with a wink as she made her way back to the counter.

"我可不敢这么肯定。" 咖啡馆老板眨了眨眼，边说边往柜台走去。

Shinji frowned as he looked back at her. "What do you mean?" He said.

真嗣皱着眉回头看向她，问道：“你什么意思？”

"She means that I'm standing right behind you, idiot!" A familiar voice said from the doorway.

"她的意思是，我正站在你身后，傻瓜！" 一个熟悉的声音从门口传来。

"Wha… Huh…?" "什… 什么…？"

"I'm glad to see that you haven't lost any of your eloquence since I last saw you!" Asuka sniped as she stepped around the table to stand in front of Shinji.

"很高兴看到你自从上次见面后，口才一点也没减退！" 明日香一边说着，一边绕过桌子站在了真嗣面前。

"A-Asuka!" Shinji gasped finally.

"飞鸟！" 真嗣终于喘息着喊道。

"Hiya Shinji." The redhead said with a smile. He stared at Asuka dumbly for a few moments, even while his heart pounded fiercely in his chest. He could see that she had been hurt. Hurt because he had been unable to protect her in the battle. Her right wrist was wrapped in thick crepe bandage almost to her elbow, and from above her left eyebrow to the side of her cheekbone the faintest hint of bruising flowered around her bright blue eye.

"你好，真嗣。"红发女孩微笑着说。他呆呆地盯着明日香看了几秒钟，尽管他的心脏在胸腔里剧烈跳动。他看得出她受了伤。因为在战斗中他未能保护好她而受伤。她的右手腕被厚厚的绉纱绷带包裹着，几乎到了肘部，而从她的左眉上方到颧骨一侧，淡淡的淤青围绕着她那明亮的蓝眼睛绽放。

She still looked so beautiful that it made his heart ache.

她依旧美得让他心痛。

Asuka shifted self-consciously under his gaze. "Well?"

明日香在他的注视下不自在地动了动。“怎么了？”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Are you gonna ask me to sit down, or are you just going to sit there and stare at me all night?"

你是要请我坐下，还是打算整晚坐在那里盯着我看？

"Oh… uh… P-Please sit down Asuka!" Shinji said, starting to his feet. Quickly he went around to the opposite side of the table and pulled out the chair for her. Arching an eyebrow at him, Asuka sat down in the chair as he pushed it in for her and waited, smirking slightly, as he sat back down across from her.

"哦…呃…请坐，明日香！" 真嗣说着，站起身来。他迅速绕到桌子对面，为她拉出椅子。明日香扬起眉毛看着他，在他为她推好椅子后坐下，脸上带着一丝微笑，等待着他重新坐回对面。

"It's good to see you Shinji!" She said.

"真嗣，见到你真好！" 她说道。

"Th-thanks, Asuka." Shinji replied, still not meeting her gaze.

"谢、谢谢，明日香。" 真嗣回答道，依旧没有与她对视。

"Would you like a drink, sweetie?" The café owner had reappeared at their table.

"宝贝，想喝点什么吗？"咖啡馆老板又出现在他们的桌旁。

"Yes please." Asuka answered. "Ummm… a latte please."

"好的，请来一杯。" 明日香回答道，"嗯……请给我一杯拿铁。"

"Pretty, and such good manners too!" The lady said with a smile. "I can see why he likes you so much!"

"真漂亮，而且举止又这么得体！" 女士微笑着说，"难怪他这么喜欢你！"

"Thank you Ma'am." Asuka replied. The café owner quickly bustled off to make her order.

"谢谢您，夫人。" 明日香回答道。咖啡馆老板迅速忙碌起来，去准备她的订单。

An awkward silence enveloped them for a few moments.

尴尬的沉默笼罩了他们片刻。

"Well, aren't you happy to see me?" Asuka asked finally.

"哎呀，见到我不开心吗？" 阿苏卡终于问道。

"Yeah…. It's just…" 是啊…只是…

"What?" Asuka interrupted more sharply.

"什么？" 明日香更加尖锐地打断道。

"You're hurt." He said simply.

"你受伤了。" 他简单地说。

"You mean this?" Asuka replied, waving her wrist in front of him. "Believe me; I've had far worse than these couple of scratches! Anyway," She continued wryly. "I thought maybe you might dig a girl with a few scars!"

"你是说这个？"明日香回答道，在他面前晃了晃手腕，"相信我，这些小擦伤根本不算什么！再说，"她继续自嘲地说，"我还以为你可能会喜欢有点疤痕的女孩呢！"

Shinji gave a short laugh at her joke, bringing his eyes up to meet hers. Again the café was silent except for the owner busily making Asuka's order behind the counter.

听到她的笑话，真嗣轻笑了一声，抬起眼睛与她对视。咖啡馆再次陷入寂静，只有老板在柜台后忙碌地准备着明日香的订单。

"I was so scared that…that you'd been hurt." Shinji said suddenly, moisture beginning to build in his eyes. "I-I tried to protect you, but I couldn't. You were so brave in the battle, so strong." He said with a sniff. "When they wouldn't let me go near your ambulance… I was scared that maybe I'd hurt you… maybe… maybe that you…"

“我好害怕……怕你受伤了。” 真嗣突然说道，眼眶开始湿润。“我……我试图保护你，但我做不到。你在战斗中那么勇敢，那么坚强。” 他抽泣着说。“当他们不让我靠近你的救护车时……我害怕可能我伤害了你……也许……也许你……”

Across from him Asuka's face grew more serious. "So, why didn't you come and see me?" She asked him.

对面，明日香的表情变得更加严肃。“那么，你为什么不来见我？”她问他。

"I couldn't…" "我做不到……"

"Bullshit Ikari!" Asuka interrupted. "I lay in that hospital bed for two days! Two goddamn days, bored out of my enormous throbbing brain, waiting for you to come through that door and…and… fucking well hold me, or something… anything!"

"胡扯，碇！" 明日香打断道，"我在那医院床上躺了两天！整整两天，无聊得我那巨大的、剧烈跳动的大脑都要炸了，就等着你推门进来，然后……然后……该死的，哪怕抱抱我也好，或者做点什么……什么都行！"

"I'm sorry…" Shinji tried to say but Asuka held up her hand.

"对不起…" 真嗣试图说，但明日香举起了她的手。

"You know who eventually turned up?" She continued. "Not you. Not even freaking Misato! You know who?"

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"Fucking Wondergirl! That's who!"

该死的神奇女孩！就是她！

"Rei?" "零？"

"Yes, Rei!" Asuka replied. "Little Miss Perfect comes to see me and she tells me that you've been locked up for defying your Arschloch of a father!"

"是的，丽！"明日香回答道，"完美小姐来看我了，她告诉我你因为违抗你那混蛋父亲而被关起来了！"

Shinji just nodded, unable to answer her.

真嗣只是点了点头，无法回答她。

"All well and good, I approve of you doing that." Asuka continued more calmly, nodding to herself. "So anyway, I get up from my sickbed and force Wondergirl to take me down to the cells, to see you! I walked through four kilometres of breezy hallways in a flimsy hospital gown. Four kilometres! Only a drip stand, a backless gown and a pair of paper hospital underpants between me and all of the douchebag lolicon perverts that NERV seems to keep on its payroll!"

"一切顺利，我赞成你这么做。"明日香继续平静地说道，同时对自己点了点头。"总之，我从病床上爬起来，强迫奇迹女孩带我下到牢房来看你！我穿着单薄的病号服，在四公里长的通风走廊里走了一遭。四公里啊！我和那些 NERV 似乎一直在雇佣的变态萝莉控混蛋之间，只隔着一个点滴架、一件无后背的病号服和一条纸质医院内裤！"

"Oh." Shinji said simply.

"哦。" 真嗣简单地说。

"You'd better believe it!"

你最好相信它！

At that moment the café owner returned with Asuka's coffee. The redhead thanked her sweetly before waiting for the lady to return to the counter. A few other customers came staggering in at that time and soon the owner was fully occupied with them.

就在那时，咖啡馆老板带着明日香的咖啡回来了。红发女孩甜甜地向她道谢，然后等待女士回到柜台。与此同时，又有几位顾客踉跄着进来，很快老板就忙于应付他们了。

Shinji waited as Asuka poured some sugar into her glass and took a sip of the milky looking coffee. "Bleargh." She said sticking her tongue out. "She may be a nice lady, but she makes a truly appalling cup of coffee!"

真嗣等待着，看着明日香往自己的杯子里倒了一些糖，然后抿了一口那看起来奶乎乎的咖啡。“呸。”她吐了吐舌头说，“她或许是个好女士，但她泡的咖啡真是糟糕透顶！”

"Now." She continued finally. "Where was I?"

她终于继续说道：“我刚才说到哪儿了？”

"Uh…" Shinji replied. "Walking through NERV in paper underpants?"

"呃…" 真嗣回答道，"穿着纸内裤在 NERV 里走动？"

Asuka sighed. "That's right." She said with a nod. "Which was all your fault, by the way."

明日香叹了口气。“没错。”她点头说道，“顺便说一句，这都是你的错。”

Shinji chose neither to confirm nor deny this, but rather waited for the redhead to continue her tale. Which she did after another short pause for effect.

真嗣既没有确认也没有否认这一点，而是等待着红发女子继续她的叙述。她为了效果又短暂停顿了一下，然后继续讲了下去。

"So, Wondergirl and I finally make to the cells area and what do we find?" She asked rhetorically. "It was empty! The only person there was some dirty old guard who kept undressing me with his eyes. Eventually Ayanami got him to stop ogling me long enough for him to tell us that you were released about twenty-four hours earlier! A whole goddamn day and you didn't even see fit to visit your girlfriend, who was lying in the fucking hospital! How do you think I felt?"

“所以，我和 Wondergirl 终于到了牢房区，你猜我们发现了什么？”她反问道，“那里空无一人！唯一在场的是一个脏兮兮的老守卫，他一直用眼神对我上下打量。最后，绫波让他停止了对我的窥视，这才告诉我们你已经在二十四小时前被释放了！整整一天过去了，你甚至没想到要来看看你躺在医院里的女朋友！你觉得我是什么感受？”

"I-I'm sorry…" Shinji stammered.

"我...我很抱歉…" 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

"Oh no, you don't get to 'Sorry' your way out of this one Ikari!" Asuka interrupted. "Naturally I was pissed. So I discharged myself from the infirmary and caught the train back to the apartment. I think that you know where this is going, don't you?"

"哦不，你别想用一句'对不起'就摆脱这件事，碇！" 明日香打断道，"我当然很生气。所以我从医务室出来，赶火车回到了公寓。我想你知道接下来会发生什么，不是吗？"

"Uh-huh." 嗯哼。

"Of course, you're not there, though some of your clothes and backpack are missing from our room." Asuka paused for a moment and sniffed. Shinji looked up from the table and was shocked to see tears forming in her bright blue eyes. "You do remember our room, don't you Shinji?"

当然，你不在那里，尽管你的一些衣服和背包从我们的房间里不见了。" 明日香停顿了一下，吸了吸鼻子。真嗣从桌子上抬起头，震惊地看到她那明亮的蓝眼睛里涌出了泪水。"你还记得我们的房间，对吧，真嗣？"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"The room where you held me and kissed me the night before… before the Angel tried to take me?" Asuka asked him. "Where you told me it would be okay and that you'd never leave me alone?"

"那个房间，你前一晚抱着我、吻我的地方……在天使试图带走我之前？" 明日香问他，"在那里，你告诉我一切都会好起来，你永远不会让我孤单？"

"Y-Yes." "是-是的。"

"Yet here you are, Shinji. Running away again. If it hadn't been for your knight in shining armour act for Hikari, I might never have found you."

然而你还是在这里，真嗣。又一次逃避了。如果不是你为光扮演了那个闪耀骑士的角色，我可能永远也找不到你。

"Y-You know about that?"

"你……你知道那件事？"

"Of course I do!" She replied. "How do you think that I happened to find you here? Hikari rang me straight after you did your little disappearing act. She's a smart girl… sometimes. She at least knew that I'd want to know why you were moping around the seedy end of town like a lost puppy! Apparently only pausing briefly from your wandering ways to kick a wayward salaryman in the balls!"

“当然会啦！”她回答道，“你以为我怎么会在这里找到你？你一玩消失，光就立刻给我打电话了。她是个聪明的女孩……有时候。至少她知道我会想知道你为什么像只迷路的小狗一样在城里的破败地带游荡！显然，你只是在漫无目的地游荡中短暂停下，踢了一个不守规矩的上班族一脚！”

"Oh." 哦。

"Hmmm…" Asuka said after it became clear that Shinji wasn't going to elaborate on that syllable. "Shinji. This whole 'I talk, you listen' thing is all well and good. I'm usually a big fan of it, you know that. Most of the time. But this one-sided conversation needs to become much more balanced, now."

"嗯……" 在意识到真嗣不会对这个音节做进一步解释后，明日香开口道，"真嗣，这种'我说你听'的模式本身没什么问题，我通常也很喜欢这样，你知道的，大多数时候都是。但现在，这种单向的对话需要变得更加平衡才行。"

"O-Okay…" "好…"

"So… talk." 那么……说吧。

"Well," Shinji began, his eyes glued to the table top. "F-Father put me in the cells, because he said I had disobeyed orders and been insubordinate to him during the battle. They only kept me in there overnight though. Some Section 2 guy came the next day and told me I could go home. Father didn't even come to release me himself."

"嗯，" 真嗣开始说道，他的目光紧盯着桌面。"父亲把我关进了牢房，因为他说我在战斗中违抗命令，对他不敬。不过他们只关了我一夜。第二天，一个第二课的人来告诉我可以回家了。父亲甚至没有亲自来释放我。"

"Did you really expect him to?"

你真的指望他这么做吗？

"I-I don't know." Shinji replied, still looking downward. "I just... I went back to the apartment. You weren't there, Misato wasn't there. Only Pen-Pen was waiting for me. He just wanted me to feed him, of course. After that he just went back into his fridge." He paused for a second before continuing. "I rang Misato; she told me that you were in the infirmary. Sh-She couldn't even tell me if you were okay or not. That scared me. I-I just hung up on her. What if, because of me, you had been really badly injured? What if you had lost an arm or leg or something? I was so scared! I thought that if I had done that to you, you…you might never want to see me again. I couldn't face that, so I-I ran away… again. Like I always do."

"我...我不知道。" 真嗣回答道，依旧低着头。"我只是...回到了公寓。你不在，美里也不在。只有企鹅在等我。它当然只是想让我喂它。之后它就回冰箱里去了。" 他停顿了一下，然后继续说："我给美里打了电话；她告诉我你在医务室。她甚至无法告诉我你是否安好。这让我很害怕。我...我就挂了电话。如果因为我，你受了重伤怎么办？如果失去了手臂或腿怎么办？我太害怕了！我想，如果我对你做了那样的事，你可能永远都不想见我了。我无法面对这个，所以我...我又逃跑了...就像我总是做的那样。"

He grew silent again. Asuka sighed to herself and took another sip of her coffee.

他又沉默了。明日香暗自叹了口气，又抿了一口咖啡。

"Look," She said after a pause. Shinji brought his gaze up from the teacup in his hands and stared at her. "I know that you think that I can't understand what you feel."

"看，" 她停顿了一下后说道。真嗣从手中的茶杯抬起目光，凝视着她。"我知道你认为我无法理解你的感受。"

"No." He said. "No one can ever understand anyone! My father… he wanted me try to kill you! I was so scared that you would never want to see me again because I was too weak to try and save you. I was scared that you'd be angry at me, that you might even hate me!"

"不。" 他说，"没有人能真正理解别人！我的父亲……他竟然要我尝试杀了你！我害怕极了，怕你因为我无力救你而再也不愿见我。我害怕你会生我的气，甚至可能会恨我！"

"Hate you?" Asuka said incredulously. "You did save me, you big dope! Why would I be angry if the person that I cared about most in the world saved me?"

"恨你？" 明日香难以置信地说，"你确实救了我，你这个大傻瓜！如果这个世界上我最在乎的人救了我，我为什么要生气呢？"

"I-I thought that I had let you die Asuka… You don't know what it's like to see the only thing you've ever let yourself care about be destroyed in front of your eyes! My father…"

我以为我让你死了，明日香……你不知道看着你唯一允许自己去关心的东西在你眼前被摧毁是什么感觉！我的父亲……

"Shinji," Asuka interrupted, reaching out a hand and placing it over his. "I know what your father has done to you. When I say that I understand, I mean it. Maybe better than anyone else could, I know what it means to you to be treated the way you are by him."

"真嗣，"明日香打断他，伸出手放在他的手上。"我知道你父亲对你做了什么。当我说我理解时，我是认真的。也许比任何人都更能体会，我知道他那样对待你对你意味着什么。"

"How could you know?" Shinji asked with real passion in his voice. "How could you understand? You always been the best, always been praised! I-I only want him to see how hard I'm working just trying to live up to him… but all he does is reject me and try to destroy anything I care about! He tried to make me kill you Asuka! How could you understand how that feels?"

"你怎么可能知道？" 真嗣的声音中带着真切的情感，"你怎么可能理解？你一直都是最优秀的，总是受到赞扬！我……我只是希望他能看见我为了达到他的期望而多么努力……但他只是拒绝我，试图摧毁我在乎的一切！他曾试图让我杀了你，明日香！你怎么可能理解那种感受？"

The silence between them after his outburst was heavy and oppressive. As he looked over at Asuka he face was obscured by her hair as she hung her head down.

他爆发后两人之间的沉默沉重而压抑。当他看向明日香时，她的脸被垂下的头发遮住了。

"I-I'm sorry, Asuka." He began. "I didn't mean…"

"我...我很抱歉，明日香。" 他开始说道，"我不是故意的……"

The redhead held up her hand and the words died on is lips. Slowly she raised her head. He was shocked to see the lone tear that ran down her bruised cheek. The blueness of her moisture filled eyes seemed intensified by the emotion behind them.

红发女子举起手，话语在他唇边戛然而止。她缓缓抬起头，他震惊地看到一滴孤独的泪水顺着她淤青的脸颊滑落。她那饱含泪水的蓝眼睛，在情感的映衬下显得更加深邃。

"I do understand, Shinji. Maybe more than you know…"

我确实理解，真嗣。或许比你想象的还要多……

He just nodded, still held speechless by her glistening eyes.

他只是点了点头，依旧被她那闪烁的眼睛震撼得说不出话来。

"You know…" She began almost tentatively a quiet sniff the only show of emotion in her voice. "The day I was chosen to become a pilot… was probably the worst day of my life."

"你知道的…" 她开始时几乎有些迟疑，只有一声轻微的抽泣透露出她声音中的情感。"我被选中成为飞行员的那一天…可能就是我一生中最糟糕的一天。"

"Worst?" Shinji interrupted incredulously. "But I thought…"

"最差？" 真嗣难以置信地打断道，"但我以为……"

"That's right, Shinji. Worst." Asuka said harshly, cutting him off. "It left scars on me that I can't… That… that…"

没错，真嗣，最糟了。明日香严厉地说道，打断了他。"它给我留下了无法……那……那……"

"What do you mean, Asuka?" Shinji said. "I thought that you loved to pilot Eva. You're always so strong…. Me, I'm the weak one. I'm the one that runs from everything…"

"你什么意思，明日香？" 真嗣说，"我以为你喜欢驾驶 Eva。你总是那么坚强……而我，我是软弱的那个。我是那个逃避一切的人……"

"We were living with my Grandmother in Regensburg." Asuka suddenly began speaking again. He was surprised to see that her own gaze was now fixed back on her hands as they moved restlessly around the coffee cup in front of her on the table. "Mama... Mama had been sick for nearly six months at that time I think. We had just moved to the south so that Grandmother could look after her. My father," Asuka ground out the word. "Well he had run off with the chief doctor at the psychiatric ward Mama had been in before that. Bastard."

"我们那时和祖母一起住在雷根斯堡。" 明日香突然又开始说话了。他惊讶地发现，她的目光再次回到了自己那双在桌前咖啡杯周围不安分地移动的手上。"妈妈...我想那时妈妈已经病了快六个月了。我们刚搬到南方，这样祖母可以照顾她。我父亲，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说出这个词，"他和之前妈妈住的精神病科的主治医生跑了。混蛋。"

"That's awful." Shinji said with some sympathy.

“那太糟糕了。” 真嗣带着几分同情说道。

"It wasn't so bad actually." Asuka answered. "We weren't far from the woods; sometimes Grandmother and I would wheel Mama out into the garden. We could just see the forest from her terrace. I remember that there were butterflies. They were so pretty. Grandmother would point them out to me and I'd try to chase them."

实际上，那并不算太糟。"阿苏卡回答道，"我们离树林不远；有时祖母和我会把妈妈推到花园里。从她的露台上，我们能隐约看到森林。我记得那里有蝴蝶，它们非常漂亮。祖母会指给我看，我就会试着去追逐它们。"

"Sounds nice." 听起来不错。

"It was." Asuka replied. "Sometimes I still feel like I can still smell those woods if I think about them hard enough."

"确实如此。" 明日香回答道，"有时候，如果我努力回想，我仍然觉得自己能闻到那些森林的气息。"

"I-I wish that I had happy memories like that." Shinji said.

"我-我也希望能拥有那样快乐的回忆。" 真嗣说道。

"Then one day the package came." Asuka continued flatly. "Grandmother took it from the courier and gave it to me. All that it contained was a set of ceramic neural clips and a note requesting that I present myself to the chief medical officer of NERV at New Peenemünde in northern Germany by the end of the week. I was only five, but I knew what it meant. Mama had been working so hard on Project E before… her accident. She always told me that I would be the pilot. She said that it would be the greatest joy she could have to see her daughter piloting her robot. She told me that I would become the savior of Humanity."

“然后有一天，包裹送到了。”明日香继续平淡地说，“祖母从快递员那里接过包裹，交给了我。里面只有一套陶瓷神经夹和一个便条，要求我在周末前向德国北部新佩内明德的 NERV 首席医疗官报到。那时我才五岁，但我明白这意味着什么。妈妈在事故前一直在努力参与 E 计划……她总是告诉我，我将成为驾驶员。她说，看到自己的女儿驾驶她的机器人，将是她最大的快乐。她告诉我，我将成为人类的救世主。”

Shinji just nodded, he could see that Asuka's eyes had a faraway look to them. She was, even now, still seeing the events of that day.

真嗣只是点了点头，他注意到明日香的眼神中透露出一种遥远的神情。即便此刻，她仍在回忆那天的情景。

"I ran to tell Mama." Asuka's voice broke a little at this, but no other sign of emotion crossed the redhead's features. "I ran down the hall, I can still remember the sound of my shoes clomping on the wooden floorboards. I ran and flung to door open to announce my triumph. Now Mama would be proud of me. Now she wouldn't need to be sick anymore. Now she might love me again instead of that stupid doll!"

我跑去告诉妈妈。" 明日香的声音在此刻有些哽咽，但红发少女的脸上没有流露出其他情感。"我跑过走廊，至今仍记得我的鞋子在木地板上咚咚作响的声音。我跑过去，猛地推开门，宣告我的胜利。现在妈妈会为我骄傲了。现在她不需要再生病了。现在她可能会再次爱我，而不是那个愚蠢的娃娃！"

The café was silent now. The drunks had left and the owner was busy at the till. Apart from her they were all alone in there.

咖啡馆此刻静悄悄的。醉汉们已经离开，老板正忙着在收银台前。除了她，里面就只剩下他们俩了。

"Mama was hanging from an old iron light fitting in the ceiling." Asuka said simply. "Her face was purple and swollen. Her eyes bulged out. I remember the smell… She…she had… when she had…" Asuka put her hands over her eyes. "Even the doll, that fucking dead eyed doll… She had hung it too. Its head had been nearly ripped off by the force of it as she had tried to kill it."

“妈妈被吊在屋顶上一个老旧的铁制灯具上。”明日香简单地说道，“她的脸是紫色的，肿胀着。眼睛凸了出来。我记得那气味……她……她当时……”明日香用手捂住了眼睛。“就连那个玩偶，那个该死的死鱼眼玩偶……她也把它挂了起来。它的头差点被扯断，因为她试图杀死它。”

"That… That's awful." Shinji said in horror.

“那…那太可怕了。” 真嗣惊恐地说道。

Asuka didn't even seem to hear him. "She thought it was me…"

明日香似乎根本没听见他的话。"她以为是我……"

"What?" "什么？"

"She thought it was me!" Asuka said more forcefully. "It had roughly cut red hair; it had "ASUKA" scrawled on its frilly red dress. When she strangled that fucking doll, she thought that she was killing me!"

“她以为那是我！”明日香更加有力地说道，“那东西有着粗略剪过的红发；它的红色蕾丝裙上潦草地写着‘ASUKA’。当她勒死那个该死的玩偶时，她以为她是在杀我！”

"Asuka…" "明日香……"

"Now do you still think that I don't understand rejection? Now do you think that I don't know what it's like to put your soul into something and knowing that you can never, ever, be good enough?"

现在你还认为我不懂拒绝吗？现在你还觉得我不知道那种倾注灵魂却深知自己永远无法足够好的感受吗？

"I-I'm sorry, Asuka." Shinji replied sadly. "I didn't know… You're always so strong I just thought that…"

"我...我很抱歉，明日香。" 真嗣悲伤地回答道，"我不知道...你总是那么坚强，我只是以为..."

Asuka sighed. "You just thought that everyone else was going along just fine and you were the only one struggling to hold it together in this whole clusterfuck of a world. Am I right?"

明日香叹了口气。“你以为别人都过得好好的，只有你一个人在这个乱七八糟的世界里苦苦支撑。我说得对吗？”

Shinji just nodded. 真嗣只是点了点头。

The redheaded girl just smiled at him. He couldn't help but be struck by the beauty of that smile; even with several stray tears still rolling down her pale cheeks. "Well, I've figured something out in the last month or so, Shinji." She said. "Just about everyone else feels pretty much the same way."

红发女孩只是对他微笑。他不禁被那笑容的美丽所打动，尽管她苍白的面颊上还挂着几滴游离的泪珠。“嗯，我最近这一个月左右想通了一些事情，真嗣。”她说道，“几乎其他人也都差不多是这种感觉。”

"You think?" 你这么认为吗？

"Definitely." 当然。

Finally Shinji smiled back at her. Asuka felt her heart begin to hammer in her chest as she saw that she had finally really reached him. Feeling her strength and resolve growing within her, she stood up. The noise of her chair scraping on the tiled floor echoing through the empty café. Grinning, Asuka held out her non-bandaged hand towards him.

最终，真嗣对她回以微笑。明日香感到自己的心脏开始在胸腔中剧烈跳动，因为她看到自己终于真正触动了他。感受到自己内心的力量和决心在增长，她站了起来。椅子在瓷砖地面上刮擦的声音在空荡的咖啡馆里回响。明日香咧嘴一笑，伸出她那只未包扎的手向他伸去。

"Come on, Shinji." She said with a sniff. "Let's go home. I'll even let you make me pancakes!"

"来吧，真嗣。" 她吸了吸鼻子说道，"我们回家吧。我甚至会让你给我做煎饼呢！"

He stood up and took hold of her hand. As always he was amazed at how cool and soft it felt in his own hand, nothing like the girl it belonged to. Although now, he felt that maybe he had been mistaken all along about the German girl.

他站起身，握住了她的手。一如既往，他惊叹于她的手在自己手中感觉如此凉爽柔软，与她本人截然不同。尽管现在，他觉得或许自己一直以来对那位德国女孩的看法都是错误的。

Leaving some money and a tip on the counter for the owner, the two pilots walked hand in hand out into the Tokyo-03 night.

两位飞行员在柜台上留下一些钱和给店主的小费后，手牵手走进了东京-03 的夜幕中。

The train ride through Tokyo-03's inner suburbs to their local station was mostly done in silence. Hands clasped firmly they sat nestled together in the carriage, both enjoying the sensation of touch that their close proximity brought them.

Stepping off the train and walking down the brightly lit platform to the station exit, Asuka couldn't help but remember what it had looked like before. A grey, lifeless ruin, with heavy snow drifts piling up and threatening to engulf it. Ruined and gutted trains, some lying on their sides, littered along the tracks.

走下火车，沿着灯火通明的站台走向车站出口，明日香不禁回忆起这里曾经的模样。那是一片灰暗、毫无生机的废墟，厚重的积雪堆积如山，仿佛要将一切吞没。毁坏且被掏空的火车，有的侧翻在地，散布在铁轨旁。

It seemed surreal to her even now how intact everything was. Seeing it all now filled her with a sense of mixed happiness and fear that caused her to squeeze Shinji's hand all the tighter as they walked down the road that exited the station car park. Shinji squeezed her hand back in return and gave her a nervous, but warm and genuine smile. She smiled back at him and, on an impulse, leaned in and kissed him forcefully on the lips. The redhead almost laughed as he started with surprise before returning the kiss. Just as quickly they broke off and Asuka could feel the heat of the blush that she was pleased was hidden in the dim light from the streetlamps.

即便此刻，她仍觉得一切完好无损显得如此不真实。目睹这一切，她心中涌起复杂的喜悦与恐惧，使得她紧握着走在车站停车场出口路上的真嗣的手更加用力。真嗣也回握她的手，露出紧张却温暖真挚的微笑。她回以微笑，冲动之下，倾身用力吻上他的唇。红发少年因惊讶而差点笑出声，随后回吻。他们迅速分开，明日香能感受到脸颊上的热辣，庆幸街灯昏暗的光线掩盖了她的羞红。

She drank in the warmth and tranquility of the night as they walked on. The gentle night breeze that rustled the leaves of the perpetually green trees. The sounds of crickets and unseen night creatures that filled the air with the sounds of life. She felt so alive. So full of energy. Asuka wondered briefly if her memories of trudging down this very road, dragging that heavy sled through the snow and ice, with her body emaciated and aching, was perhaps some kind of fevered dream. Without even realising she brought her hand up to her eye. The skin there was smooth and unmarked. Gone was the rough and puckered scar that marked her defeat at the hands of the Mass Production Evangelions. No sharp pain lanced through her skull at the merest touch of her bandaged hand.

他们漫步前行，她沉浸在夜晚的温暖与宁静中。轻柔的夜风拂动着常青树的叶片，蟋蟀和隐匿的夜行动物发出的声音，让空气中充满了生命的气息。她感到如此充满活力，如此精力充沛。明日香短暂地思索，是否她记忆中拖着沉重的雪橇，在这条路上艰难跋涉，身体消瘦且疼痛，只是一场热病中的幻梦。她甚至未曾察觉，便将手举至眼前。那里的肌肤光滑无瑕，曾经标志着她在量产型 EVA 手中失败的粗糙疤痕已不复存在。她的绷带手轻轻触碰，也不再有尖锐的痛楚穿透她的头颅。

She was alive. Shinji was alive. Misato and Kaji and Hikari and all of the others were alive. She had survived the 13th Angel. Just. Maybe, just maybe, she had a chance of actually making it out of this in one piece.

她还活着。真嗣还活着。美里、加持、光以及所有其他人也都活着。她勉强从第 13 使徒的袭击中幸存下来。或许，仅仅是或许，她真的有机会完好无损地走出这场危机。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" She replied, still lost in her own thoughts.

"嗯？" 她回应道，依然沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"Are you okay?" Shinji asked her with a slightly worried look on his face.

"你还好吗？" 真嗣带着一丝担忧的神情问她。

Taking a second to clear her head she saw that they had stopped just across the road from the entrance to the parking garage for their apartment block. "Of course I'm okay!" She said quickly. "Why wouldn't I be?"

她花了一秒钟整理思绪，发现他们已经停在了公寓楼停车场入口对面的马路边。"我当然没事！"她迅速回答，"我怎么会不好呢？"

"I don't know." Shinji replied. "You just seemed to space out there for a minute." He gestured to the darkened entrance to the car park that still, to Asuka, seemed like the ominous and threatening maw of some sunken monster. "You want to take the stairs, like usual?" Shinji said, beginning to lead her towards the opening of the stairwell.

"我不知道。" 真嗣回答道，"你刚才好像走神了一会儿。" 他指向停车场昏暗的入口，在明日香看来，那仍像是某种沉没怪兽阴森而充满威胁的巨口。"你想像往常一样走楼梯吗？" 真嗣说着，开始引领她朝楼梯间的入口走去。

He was quickly brought up short by Asuka's hand holding him back. The redhead had not moved from where they had been standing. He eyes were still fixed on the entrance. In her mind she could see the whole building condensed to just a pile of concrete, glass and twisted steel. There had been, since she had returned, something threatening about the car park entrance. She had avoided it ever since that first night with Misato.

他很快被明日香的手拉住，停了下来。这位红发女孩并未离开她们站立的地方，她的目光依旧紧盯着入口。在她心中，整座建筑仿佛被压缩成一堆混凝土、玻璃和扭曲的钢材。自从她回来后，停车场入口就弥漫着一种威胁感。自与美里共度的那个初夜起，她就一直避开那里。

The German girl shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. Bringing her bandaged hand up to her face she pushed her hair back from her face and looked Shinji squarely in the eyes. "What are you, stupid or something?" She said with a grin. "There's like three hundred freaking stairs up there! Let's take the lift!"

德国女孩摇了摇头，试图理清思绪。她用缠着绷带的手将脸上的头发拨开，直视着真嗣的眼睛。“你是傻还是怎么的？”她笑着说，“上面可是有三百多级台阶呢！我们坐电梯吧！”

Before Shinji could do anything more than smile uncertainly, the redhead grabbed his hand tightly in hers and dragged across the street and into the entrance beyond.

在真嗣还未来得及做出更多反应，只是带着不确定的微笑时，那位红发女孩已紧紧抓住他的手，拉着他穿过街道，进入了对面的入口。

Their footsteps echoed loudly in the concrete cavern of the car park. Shinji had the impression of being hauled bodily at speed by his fellow pilot as she made a beeline for the lift doors. Asuka pressed the up button at least a dozen times in the seven seconds or so it took the lift doors to open and dragged him inside. The doors slowly closed behind them.

他们的脚步声在停车场的混凝土空间中回响得很大。真嗣感觉自己被同伴飞行员迅速拖着，直奔电梯门而去。大约七秒钟内，电梯门打开的这段时间里，明日香至少按了十几次上行按钮，并把他拽了进去。电梯门缓缓在他们身后关闭。

"Come on, how long do these Japanese lifts take to travel a couple of floors!"

哎呀，这些日本电梯上下几层楼要花多长时间啊！

"Asuka, are you sure you're okay?"

"明日香，你确定你没事吗？"

She spun around to face him. "Of course I'm okay!" She said for the second time that night.

她转身面对他，"我当然没事！"那是她那晚第二次这么说。

"I-I'm glad." “我、我很高兴。”

The redhead smiled at him, even in her bruised face her blue eyes shining, though the look in them was verging on predatory. "Thank you Shinji… So am I…"

红发女子对他微笑，尽管脸上有瘀伤，但她的蓝眼睛依然闪烁着光芒，尽管眼神中透露出一种近乎掠食者的气息。"谢谢你，真嗣……我也是……"

"You're wel…" He was unable to say more as Asuka virtually leaped on him, her arms wrapping around him and her lips pressed to his passionately.

"你太客气了…" 他话还没说完，就被明日香几乎扑了上来，她双臂紧紧环抱住他，热情地吻上了他的唇。

There was a loud 'ding' and the lift doors slowly rattled open.

随着一声响亮的“叮”，电梯门缓缓地嘎吱打开。

Asuka pulled slightly back from the embrace, though her arms still clutched Shinji tightly.

明日香虽然稍微从拥抱中退开了一点，但她的双臂仍然紧紧地抱着真嗣。

"You know something, Shinji." Asuka said breathily. "I'm sick of pussyfooting around this…"

"你知道吗，真嗣。"明日香喘息着说，"我厌倦了这样小心翼翼地绕圈子……"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Pulling him roughly through the door and down the corridor towards their apartment door.

粗暴地拽着他穿过门廊，沿着走廊朝他们的公寓门走去。

Once inside the darkened apartment, Asuka didn't even wait for Shinji to take his shoes off at the entryway before once again pouncing upon him. The redhead pressed herself against him and kissed him passionately, forcing him back to the wall to try and balance himself. After some initial tentative moves to embrace her, he returned her kisses with equal fervour. How long they remained clasped together like that neither of them knew, all either of them was aware of was the sudden and overwhelming sense of true connection with the other and the urgency and heat of their need.

一进入昏暗的公寓，明日香甚至没等真嗣在玄关脱鞋，就再次扑向他。红发少女紧贴着他，热情地吻了上去，迫使他退到墙边以保持平衡。起初他试探性地想要拥抱她，随后便以同样的热烈回应她的吻。他们这样紧紧相拥了多久，两人都无从知晓，只知道突然间，一种强烈的真实连接感涌上心头，以及那迫切而炽热的渴望。

Finally Asuka broke off their embrace and clasped Shinji hand in her own as she led him towards the bedroom that they had shared for the last several months.

最终，明日香结束了他们的拥抱，握住真嗣的手，引领他走向他们过去几个月共同居住的卧室。

"Fuck pancakes!" Asuka breathed hoarsely. "I've got a better idea!"

"去他的煎饼！" 明日香沙哑地说道，"我有个更好的主意！"

She could sense his churning thoughts even through the fog of her own sleepiness. She turned over in the small bed and opened her eyes to look at him. In the dim blue light cast through the bedroom window she could see Shinji's own eyes shining clearly. His brow was furrowed in a slight frown. Even though he must have known that she was awake too, and looking right at him, he remained staring intently at the ceiling above them.

她能感觉到他翻腾的思绪，即便自己还沉浸在睡意的迷雾中。她在狭小的床上翻了个身，睁开眼睛望向他。透过卧室窗户洒下的幽蓝光线中，她清晰地看到真嗣的眼睛闪着光。他的眉头微微皱起，形成了一抹忧虑。尽管他肯定知道她也醒了，并且正直视着他，但他依然专注地凝视着他们头顶的天花板。

"Shinji." She said softly. His eyes narrowed slightly, but otherwise remained fixed.

"真嗣。" 她轻声说道。他的眼睛微微眯起，但除此之外目光依旧坚定。

Asuka propped herself up on her arms, feeling the sheets sliding off torso, leaving her bare upper body exposed in the cool night air. She made no attempt to cover herself.

明日香用手臂撑起身体，感觉到床单从躯干滑落，让她裸露的上半身暴露在凉爽的夜风中。她并没有试图遮掩自己。

"Shinji." She said again. "Look at me."

"真嗣。" 她再次说道，"看着我。"

His eyes moved down to look at her. Quickly she saw his gaze rest on her face, before quickly flicking down to take in her naked body. Just as quickly he returned to looking at the ceiling again. She could see the fear and shame in his eyes now.

他的目光下移，落在她身上。她很快察觉到他的视线停留在她的脸上，随即迅速下移，扫过她裸露的身体。同样迅速地，他又将目光转回天花板。此刻，她能从他的眼中看到恐惧和羞愧。

"Shinji… I said look at me!" Asuka repeated in a fierce whisper. She reached forward, clasping his face gently in her hands, feeling her own forearms touch his bare chest as she leaned forward and forced him to look into her eyes. Finally his gaze met her own. She could still feel the anxiety that constantly enveloped him. The continuous fear and second-guessing the world that even here covered him like a shroud.

"真嗣……我说了，看着我！" 明日香再次低声而坚定地说道。她伸出手，轻柔地捧住他的脸庞，随着身体前倾，感受到自己的前臂触碰到他裸露的胸膛，迫使他直视她的双眼。终于，他的目光与她交汇。她依然能感受到那股始终笼罩着他的焦虑，那种对世界的持续恐惧和不断怀疑，即便在此刻，也如同裹尸布般紧紧缠绕着他。

Asuka let her features soften and felt a small smile form unbidden on her lips. Even now he still doubted…

明日香让自己的表情柔和下来，不由自主地在唇边勾起了一抹微笑。即便到了现在，他依然心存疑虑……

"So…" She began. "What'chya thinking?"

“那么…”她开口道，“你在想什么呢？”

"I…." Shinji began uncertainly. "…nothing."

"我……" 真嗣不确定地开口，"……没什么。"

"You know, once upon a time, I would have believed that. Not anymore. Tell me."

你知道，曾经我会相信那一点。但现在不了。告诉我吧。

He held her gaze, but the answer seemed to be still trapped inside him.

他凝视着她的目光，但答案似乎仍被困在他心中。

"Let me guess." Asuka finally said. "You think that tomorrow morning I'm gonna wake up, see you next to me like this, remember what we just did and completely lose my shit, don't you?

"让我猜猜。"明日香终于开口了，"你认为明天早上我醒来，看到你这样躺在我旁边，想起我们刚刚做的事，就会彻底崩溃，对吧？"

Shinji swallowed loudly, but his eyes never left hers, nor did he attempt to answer.

真嗣大声地吞咽了一下，但他的目光始终没有离开她的眼睛，也没有试图回答。

"You're scared that I'm going to hate you." She continued. "That I'm going to yell and scream, call you a pervert, just like Asuka Langley Soryu always does. You're terrified that now your fragile little world is going to come crashing down around you. Aren't you?"

"你害怕我会讨厌你。" 她继续说道，"害怕我会大喊大叫，骂你是变态，就像惣流·明日香·兰格雷那样。你惊恐万分，担心你那脆弱的小世界即将在你周围崩塌。不是吗？"

Finally, Shinji nodded. 最终，真嗣点了点头。

Asuka sighed heavily. "Has it ever occurred to you, that just maybe this is something that I've wanted all along too? That maybe I'm actually happy that after all of this time we've finally done this?"

明日香重重地叹了口气。“你有没有想过，也许这正是我一直以来也渴望的？或许我真的很高兴，经过这么长时间，我们终于做到了这一点？”

Shinji's eyes widened. "Really?" He answered in a whisper. "You… you always wanted this too?"

真嗣的眼睛睁大了。“真的吗？”他低声回答。“你……你也一直想要这样吗？”

Asuka did not speak. Clasping his face even more firmly between her hands she leaned forward and kissed him gently on the lips. Shinji closed his eyes, the cares falling away from his face. Softly Asuka slid her right hand away from his cheek. Then she curled up her middle fingers and flicked him squarely between the eyes.

明日香没有说话。她双手更加坚定地捧住他的脸，倾身向前，轻柔地吻上了他的唇。真嗣闭上了眼睛，脸上的忧虑随之消散。明日香轻柔地将右手从他的脸颊移开，随后她弯曲中指，准确地在他眉心处轻弹了一下。

"Oww!" He exclaimed, his eyes opening in surprise and his hand going to his forehead.

"哎哟！" 他惊呼一声，眼睛惊讶地睁开，手不自觉地摸向额头。

"Let me make one thing perfectly clear, Third!" Asuka said with a grin. "This is not a fluke!"

“让我把话说清楚，第三！”明日香笑着说，“这绝非偶然！”

End Chapter 12 结束第 12 章

So, this chapter is actually only the first half of the one that I had originally planned. Not to mention it ended up taking a very different direction than the original chapter 12 was going to.

所以，这一章实际上只是我最初计划章节的前半部分。更不用说它最终走向了与原定第 12 章截然不同的方向。

This part kind of grew into something much larger. The upside being that the next half/chapter shouldn't be too far off.

这部分逐渐发展成了更为庞大的内容。好处是，下一章节应该不会相隔太远。

Some might think that Shinji might have been a little out of character in his altercation with the drunk. I disagree. From his actions in the series I feel that he can be brave and resourceful, especially if pushed beyond a certain point. Also, his relationship with a certain time-travelling redhead has changed him more than even he would admit, methinks.

有人或许认为真嗣在与醉汉的争执中有些失态，但我并不认同。从他在系列中的行为来看，我觉得他可以勇敢且机智，尤其是当被逼到一定程度时。此外，他与某位穿梭时空的红发女子的关系，我认为已经让他改变了许多，甚至超出了他自己的承认。

I apologize again for the delay. Sometimes life just conspires to derail your best intentions. Further updates will occur in a much more timely fashion!

再次为延误道歉。有时生活就是会联手破坏你最好的打算。后续更新将以更加及时的方式进行！

Thanks for reading! 感谢阅读！

Cheers 干杯

Donderkind. 唐德金德。

## Chapter 13: Touch, Pause,

第 13 章：触碰，暂停，

So... long time no see!

所以...好久不见！

Apologies for the huge delay in updating. Lets just say that a case of writer's-block that was almost like a physical force had me in its grip. Not much of an excuse, I know, but its the truth!

对于更新延迟这么久，深感抱歉。只能说，我遭遇了几乎像物理力量般的写作障碍，让我深陷其中。我知道这不是什么好借口，但事实确实如此！

Also, this chapter, until about two hours ago, was a smidge over 12,000 words. It just felt a tad unwieldy, so I've split it into two parts that will now be Chapters 13 and 14. So this will be a two part update.

另外，直到两小时前，这一章节原本超过 12000 字。感觉有点过于冗长，所以我将其拆分为两部分，现在将成为第 13 章和第 14 章。因此，这次更新将分为两部分。

Unbroken 坚不可摧

Chapter 13 第 13 章

Touch… Pause… 触碰…暂停…

Asuka groggily returned to the waking world to find herself all alone, lying sprawled out in a cold and empty bed.

明日香昏昏沉沉地回到清醒的世界，发现自己孤身一人，四仰八叉地躺在一张冰冷空荡的床上。

"What the…" She muttered blearily as she propped herself up on her elbows. The small room was dimly lit by the shaft of early morning sunlight that pierced the curtains. It revealed that she was indeed alone in the uncharacteristically untidy and dishevelled looking bedroom.

"什么情况……" 她含糊地嘟囔着，用肘部撑起身体。狭小的房间里，一束清晨的阳光穿透窗帘，昏暗地照亮了四周。这光亮揭示了她确实独自一人，身处一个异常凌乱、不修边幅的卧室中。

Flopping back down onto the pillow with a loud exhalation of breath, she took stock of her situation. Sure, she was definitely alone in there, but the current state of the bedclothes, and the fact that she was undeniably nude under the thin sheet that currently covered her, assured her that what she had thought had happened, had actually happened.

重重地倒回枕头上，伴随着一声长叹，她开始审视自己的处境。确实，她显然是独自一人，但凌乱的床单以及她确实一丝不挂地躺在薄被单下的现状，都证实了她所认为发生的事情真的发生了。

"And now I wake up alone. What a fucking cliché!" She groaned to the ceiling. "Where the hell is Shinji, anyway?" She rolled on her side and sat up on the side of the bed, tossing the sheet aside in annoyance. "Ach, Gott…" She muttered at a frightening thought that struck her. "That baka better not have run away again!"

现在醒来却孤身一人，真是老套至极！" 她对着天花板抱怨道，"真嗣那家伙到底去哪了？" 她翻身侧躺，坐在床边，不耐烦地扔掉被单。"啊，天哪……" 她喃喃自语，突然被一个可怕的想法击中，"那个笨蛋该不会又跑了吧！

The sudden sound of the muffled clattering of dishes quelled her momentary panic. Quickly covering herself with a short silk dressing gown, she smoothed down her ruffled hair and threw open the bedroom door.

突然传来的餐具闷响平息了她短暂的恐慌。她迅速用一件短丝绸晨衣裹住自己，抚平凌乱的头发，猛地打开了卧室门。

An enticing smell greeted her nostrils as she stood there yawning hugely. Shinji, it seemed, was cooking something in the apartment's tiny kitchen, and it smelled glorious! She shuffled towards the bathroom and quickly shut the door behind her. After finishing up she washed her hands at the basin and splashed some water on her face to wake herself up. Patting her face dry she looked, as if for the first time, at the young woman facing her in the mirror. Did she look any different? Her own image frowned slightly back at her as she examined her reflection minutely.

她站在那里打哈欠时，一股诱人的香味扑鼻而来。似乎是真嗣在狭小的厨房里烹饪着什么，那味道真是美妙极了！她拖着脚步走向浴室，迅速关上身后的门。洗漱完毕后，她在洗手盆洗手，往脸上泼了些水以清醒自己。擦干脸后，她仿佛第一次般凝视着镜中面对自己的年轻女子。她看起来有任何不同吗？她自己的影像微微皱眉，回望着她，仔细审视着镜中的倒影。

No. Nothing appeared different about the young, healthy looking teenager in the mirror. No outward signs showed themselves of the change that she felt had taken place within her psyche. Her image smiled back at her. What did she expect? A glowing neon sign proclaiming that she and Shinji Ikari had finally crossed the final threshold to intimacy? She thought about how long she had actually wanted this, even as far back as the early days at the cabin in the wilderness she had craved for Shinji to hold her, to comfort her, to love her. 'Hell,' she thought, 'Probably even before that.' Once, in one of those cold and desolate nights in the old cabin, she had come close to using him that way. Now she was glad that she hadn't given into loneliness and despair back then. 'This was right.' She thought to herself. She could see her own reflection now staring back at her approvingly.

不，镜中那位年轻健康的少女并无异样。内心深处的变化并未在外表留下痕迹。她的影像微笑回应。她期待什么呢？一个闪烁的霓虹标志，宣告她与碇真嗣终于跨越了亲密的最后界限？她回想起自己有多久以来渴望这一刻，甚至在荒野小屋的早期日子里，她就渴望真嗣拥抱她、安慰她、爱她。“天哪，”她想，“或许在那之前就开始了。”有一次，在那个古老小屋的寒冷孤寂之夜，她差点就那样利用了他。现在她庆幸自己当时没有屈服于孤独和绝望。“这是对的。”她自言自语。此刻，她能看见自己的倒影正满意地回望着她。

A small snort escaped her lips. "Ikuhayo Asuka," She said ironically to the mirror. "Stop being so goddamn ridiculous!"

她轻蔑地哼了一声，对着镜子讽刺地说：“碇真嗣，别再这么荒唐了！”

Quickly brushing her hair Asuka checked herself out in the mirror one last time. With a decisive nod she opened the bathroom door and stepped out into the living area of the apartment. She could just make out the Third Child standing in the kitchen with his back to her. The faint humming that he made as he busied himself about his task made her grin to herself as she walked forward.

迅速梳理着头发，明日香在镜子前最后一次审视自己。她果断地点了点头，打开浴室门，步入公寓的居住区。她隐约看见第三适格者背对着她站在厨房里。他忙碌时发出的轻微哼唱声，让她在走向前时暗自微笑。

Shinji was still standing at the stove-top with his back to her as she reached the table, pulled a chair out and sat on it. He turned at the noise and smiled at her, before blushing and returning quickly to the pan in front of him.

当她走到桌边，拉出椅子坐下时，真嗣仍背对着她站在炉灶前。他听到声响转过身来，对她微笑，随即脸红并迅速转回面前的平底锅。

Asuka sat and waited expectantly. In short order a small, steaming pile of pancakes were placed in front of her by the still silent Third Child. "Oh boy, these smell good!" The redhead murmured as she smothered them in syrup and began shovelling them into her mouth.

明日香坐下来，满怀期待地等待着。很快，一叠热气腾腾的小煎饼被沉默寡言的第三适格者放在了她面前。"哇，这些闻起来真香！"红发少女低声说着，一边给煎饼浇上糖浆，一边开始大口吃起来。

"Theth are delithious, Thinji!" Asuka said, her mouth still crammed with food. Quickly she finished chewing what was in her mouth and swallowed. "I can even tell you how long it's been since I had pancakes! Thank you!"

"塞斯真是美味极了，辛吉！" 明日香说道，嘴里还塞满了食物。她迅速地咀嚼完口中的食物并吞了下去。"我甚至能告诉你我有多久没吃过煎饼了！谢谢你！"

"Y-You're welcome, Asuka." Shinji replied, his eyes still not meeting hers.

"不客气，明日香。" 真嗣回答道，他的目光依旧没有与她相遇。

The German girl put down her cutlery onto her plate with a clang and looked at him. "What are you doing, Shinji?" She said searchingly.

德国女孩将餐具哐啷一声放在盘子上，注视着他。“你在做什么，真嗣？”她探究地问道。

"W-What do you mean?" He replied, blushing. "I-I'm making breakfast."

"你这是什么意思？"他回答道，脸颊泛红。"我-我在做早餐。"

"I mean, why are you acting like this, again?" The redhead replied, still not picking up the knife and fork. "Why can't you even look me in the eye?"

"我是说，你为什么又这样表现？" 红发女子回应道，依旧没有拿起刀叉。"为什么你连看我一眼都做不到？"

"I-It's just 'cos…" He stammered. "I didn't want to upset… Ummm… I just want to make sure that you didn't think…"

"我-我只是因为……" 他结巴地说，"我不想让你难过……嗯……我只是想确认你不会误会……"

"Shinji." Asuka interrupted.

"真嗣。" 明日香打断道。

"Yes?" "什么事？"

"What did I say to you last night?"

昨晚我对你说了什么？

"Th-that…" "这...这..."

"You belong to me now, Shinji Ikari! Forever." Asuka said forcefully. "Not even Third Impact will change that, do you understand?"

你现在属于我了，碇真嗣！永远。"明日香强硬地说道，"即使是第三次冲击也无法改变这一点，你明白了吗？

"Uh-huh." He replied with a nod.

"嗯哼。" 他点头回应道。

"So, let me ask you just one thing. Are you happy about that?"

那么，我就问你一件事。你对那件事感到高兴吗？

"Y-Yes, of course I am." Shinji stammered. "I've wanted to be with you ever since… we'll ever since I met you. I've never felt like this before…I- I've never felt this…happy I guess. I'm just scared that I'll do something that will make you realise that you've made a terrible mistake! "

"是的，当然是的。" 真嗣结巴地说，"自从……自从我遇见你以来，我就一直想和你在一起。我以前从未有过这种感觉……我，我从未感到过……我想是幸福吧。我只是害怕我会做出什么事，让你意识到你犯了一个可怕的错误！"

"Sheesh… you are such a pessimist! What do I have to do to convince you? You sleep with the most exotic and beautiful girl in all Japan and you're scared of being too happy about it?" Asuka said incredulously. "I don't know what else I have to do, Third! I'm starting to feel that I'm sounding like a broken record here! What is it going to take to convince you?"

哎呀…你真是个悲观主义者！我要怎么做才能说服你呢？你和全日本最异国风情、最美丽的女孩共度良宵，却还害怕对此感到太幸福？" 明日香难以置信地说道。"我不知道还要做什么，第三！我开始觉得自己像是在重复播放坏掉的唱片！到底要怎样才能说服你？"

"Convince him of what?" Came a voice from behind her. Before she even turned around she could see Shinji pale as he looked over her shoulder at the unexpected intruder on their private conversation.

"说服他相信什么？" 一个声音从她身后传来。在她还没来得及转身之前，她就能看到真嗣脸色苍白，越过她的肩膀望向那个意外闯入他们私人谈话的不速之客。

"Uh… Hi Misato..." Shinji stammered.

"呃… 嗨，美里…" 真嗣结巴地说。

"Morning Shinji, morning Asuka." Their guardian said, stifling a yawn as she walked stiffly into the kitchen area, a purple satin dressing gown wrapped around her body. Much like Asuka, one of her arms, or what was visible of it protruding from the gown, was swathed in bandages, also there was a cut above her right eyebrow that was held together with a couple of butterfly strips.

“早上好，真嗣，早上好，明日香。”他们的监护人说道，一边打着哈欠，一边僵硬地走进厨房区域，身上裹着一件紫色的缎面晨衣。和明日香一样，她露出的那只手臂也缠着绷带，右眉上方还有一道伤口，用几条蝶形胶带固定着。

"Hi Misato." Asuka said brightly, hiding her embarrassment at the close call. "What time did you get in last night?"

"嗨，美里。" 明日香故作轻松地说道，掩饰着刚才差点被发现的尴尬。"你昨晚几点回来的？"

"Ugh… two-thirty… Two goddamned thirty!" Their guardian repeated in disgust. "The Commander wouldn't let me leave until all of the damage reports and requisition requests were completed and logged."

"呃……两点半……该死的两点半！"他们的监护人厌恶地重复道，"指挥官不会让我离开，直到所有的损坏报告和申请请求都完成并记录在案。"

"That's terrible." Shinji said sympathetically.

“真是糟糕。” 真嗣同情地说道。

"Yeah, well… That's what they pay me the big bucks for!" Misato said sourly. "Ooooh! Pancakes!" She exclaimed more brightly as Shinji placed another plate in front of her. "My favourite!"

"是啊，嗯……他们给我那么多钱就是为了这个！" 葛城美里酸溜溜地说。"哦！是煎饼！" 当真嗣又在她面前放下一盘时，她更加兴奋地喊道，"我最喜欢的！"

As their guardian commenced the demolition of her large stack of golden pancakes, Asuka and Shinji shared a knowing smile.

当他们的监护人开始消灭她那一大摞金黄色煎饼时，明日香和真嗣相视一笑，心照不宣。

"So…" Misato asked, finally lifting her head from over her plate. "What's the big occasion?"

“那么…” 三佐终于从她的盘子上抬起头来，问道：“是什么大日子吗？”

"Huh?" Shinji said. "嗯？" 真嗣说道。

"W-What are you talking about Misato?" Asuka answered in surprise.

"你在说什么啊，美里？" 明日香惊讶地回答道。

"You know… all this." Their guardian said, gesturing wildly in the air with her spork. "Shinji making pancakes for breakfast on a school day, you two sitting there making gooey-eyes at each other. If I didn't know better I'd think that…"

“你知道的…这一切。”他们的监护人说着，手里拿着叉勺在空中比划。“真嗣在学校日早上做煎饼当早餐，你们俩坐在那儿眉来眼去的。要不是我了解得更清楚，我真会以为……”

"Be careful what you say, Misato…" Asuka interrupted mock-threateningly. "In your injured state you could easily say something that might accidentally make this spork fly up and embed itself in your eye!"

"小心你说的话，Misato……" Asuka 带着几分戏谑的威胁打断道，"以你现在的受伤状态，很容易不小心说出什么话，让这把勺叉飞起来扎进你的眼睛里！"

"Bah… You're so mean!" Misato replied.

"呃……你真坏！" 三佐回答道。

"You don't even know the half of it!" Asuka answered.

"你连一半都不知道呢！" 明日香回答道。

The conversation trailed off as Misato once again launched into her plate of pancakes. The two pilots shared a knowing look across the small kitchen.

谈话随着碇真嗣再次埋头于她的那盘煎饼而逐渐减弱。两位驾驶员在小厨房里交换了一个心照不宣的眼神。

"Oh, by the way, Asuka…" Misato suddenly interrupted. "I hate to interrupt you two making lovey-eyes at each other, but Ritsuko wants you at NERV by 0900 for a full medical exam and work up."

“哦，对了，明日香……” 美里突然插话道，“我实在不想打断你们俩眉来眼去的，但律子要你在九点前到 NERV 接受全面体检和工作安排。”

"Are you serious?" Asuka exclaimed. "What does that grizzled old harpy want this time? I swear that she's got some weird fetish for probing and prodding me whenever the fancy takes her!"

"你认真的吗？" 明日香惊呼道，"那个满脸皱纹的老妖婆这次又想要什么？我发誓她一有兴致就喜欢对我探头探脑的，肯定有什么怪癖！"

"Now now Asuka." Misato replied placatingly. "Ritsuko needs to make sure that you haven't been harmed by the last battle. Or have you forgotten the fact that you were nearly absorbed by the Angel before Shinji saved you?"

"好了好了，明日香。" 美里安抚地回答，"律子需要确认你上一场战斗后没有受到伤害。还是你忘了，你差点被使徒吸收，是真嗣救了你？"

"Humph… stupidweirdecchiJapanesefetishpervertevilscientistdoctorhentaischlampe….." Asuka muttered to herself sourly as she stomped off to the shower to get ready.

"哼……愚蠢古怪的日本恋物癖变态邪恶科学家医生 hentai 贱人……" 明日香酸溜溜地自言自语，一边跺着脚走向浴室准备洗漱。

"What about me, Misato?" Shinji asked. "Do I need to go into see Doctor Akagi as well?"

"我呢，美里小姐？" 真嗣问道，"我也需要进去见赤木博士吗？"

"Nope." She replied. "Only lover-girl is required for the time being. You get to go to school! Aren't you lucky?"

"不。" 她回答道，"暂时只需要情人小姐。你可以去上学了！你不是很幸运吗？"

"Uh…Yeah. I guess." 呃……对，我想是的。

The examination room still smelled of stale cigarettes and disinfectant. Asuka squirmed in her seat, trying to find the most comfortable position with her bare skin against the cold vinyl.

考场内依旧弥漫着陈旧的烟味和消毒水的气息。明日香在座位上不安地扭动，试图在裸露的皮肤与冰冷的塑料之间找到最舒适的姿势。

"Hold still, please." The blonde doctor said flatly as she drew a large syringe full of dark red blood from the arm of the prone girl.

"请保持不动。"金发医生平淡地说道，同时从躺着的女孩手臂上抽取了一支装满暗红色血液的大注射器。

The redhead bit down on any scathing comments that she might have had for the head of Project E, figuring that she wasn't exactly in a position of strength as she was. Also she was hoping to get the uncomfortable and more than a little humiliating procedure over and done with and hopefully get back to Shinji's side as quickly as she could. However, her patience was beginning to wear thin as Dr Akagi placed the vial of blood into some kind of analyser and sat down at her computer terminal. She then typed away at her report without looking up or even acknowledging the German girl in any way.

红发女子强忍下对 E 计划负责人的尖刻评论，意识到自己此刻并非处于强势地位。她更希望尽快结束这令人不适且颇感屈辱的程序，以便能尽快回到真嗣身边。然而，随着赤木博士将血液样本放入某种分析器，并在电脑终端前坐下，开始埋头撰写报告，对德国女孩视若无睹，她的耐心正逐渐消磨殆尽。

Finally she could hold her tongue no longer. "So, no mousey little lackey to watch me being violated this time?" She asked tartly. "Or don't you want any witnesses?"

最终，她再也按捺不住了。“那么，这次没有胆小如鼠的仆人来观看我被侵犯了吗？”她尖刻地问道，“还是说，你不想有任何目击者？”

The scientist turned to her with a blank expression. Asuka was surprised to notice the sunken cheeks and baggy eyes of the usually impeccably presented woman. She held the redhead's gaze for a few seconds before returning to her screen with a grunt.

科学家面无表情地转向她。明日香惊讶地注意到，这位平时总是打扮得无可挑剔的女性，如今却面颊凹陷，眼袋松弛。她与红发女子对视了几秒，随后哼了一声，目光又回到了屏幕上。

"Fine." Asuka griped petulantly. At the same time she was puzzled at the lack of fire from her former verbal sparring partner. Nothing that she could think of could account for the change that was evident in the older woman.

"好吧。"明日香不满地抱怨道。与此同时，她对前言辞交锋的对手缺乏火药味感到困惑。她想不出任何理由来解释这位年长女性身上显而易见的变化。

After what felt like over an hour to the redhead the doctor stood up and continued her examination. First nearly blinding her with bright lights being shone in both of her eyes, sticking various instruments into her ears, nose, mouth and finally a long and uncomfortable examination of her more private areas.

红发女子感觉仿佛过了一个多小时，医生才站起来继续检查。先是几乎用强光照得她睁不开眼，接着将各种器械插入她的耳朵、鼻子、嘴巴，最后进行了一次漫长且不适的私密部位检查。

Eventually the machine off to the side gave two long beeps and the doctor straightened up and snapped off her blue nitrile gloves. Without a word she returned to typing more data into her computer terminal, the harsh light once again bathing her tired face in an unhealthy glow.

最终，旁边的那台机器发出两声长鸣，医生挺直了腰，啪的一声摘掉了她的蓝色丁腈手套。她一言不发地回到电脑终端前继续输入数据，刺眼的光线再次将她疲惫的面庞笼罩在不健康的光芒中。

More time passed. Asuka sat seething, and squirming uncomfortably, in her chair, gooseflesh appearing all over her bare skin as the air-conditioning continued to blow cool air over her. Finally she could hold her tongue no longer.

时间继续流逝。明日香坐在椅子上，气愤难平，坐立不安，空调持续吹送的凉风让她裸露的皮肤上起了鸡皮疙瘩。最终，她再也按捺不住了。

"Ah.., Excuse me Doc…" She began.

"啊..，不好意思，医生……" 她开始说道。

Ritsuko looked up at her tiredly; the redhead could have sworn that the scientist appeared to be surprised to see her still lying there.

律子疲惫地抬头看着她；红发女子可以发誓，这位科学家似乎对看到她仍然躺在那里感到惊讶。

"Um... yes Asuka?" She said with a small frown. She finally seemed to gather her thoughts. "You may dress."

“呃……怎么了，明日香？”她微微皱眉说道。她终于整理好了思绪。“你可以穿衣服了。”

"Gee, thanks Doctor Akagi. You're a credit to your Hypocritic Oath!"

哎呀，谢谢赤木医生。你真是希波克拉底誓言的典范！

"It's Hippocratic Oath, actually." Ritsuko said distractedly.

“其实是希波克拉底誓言。”律子心不在焉地说道。

"I know what it is." Asuka replied acerbically as she began pulling on her underwear. "So…." She continued after finally slipping her yellow dress on over her head and sitting back down opposite the doctor. "What's the damage, Doc? Am I gonna start sprouting antennae? Or maybe develop radioactive breath that can level a city block? That might be kinda cool."

"Hmm?" Was the reply. "Erm... no, Asuka." She said distractedly. "There no sign of any contamination from the Angel. You're as healthy as anyone has any right to be in this day and age."

"嗯？" 是回复。"呃...不，明日香。" 她心不在焉地说，"没有发现任何来自使徒的污染迹象。你和这个时代任何人一样健康。"

"Thank you, that's very comforting. May I go now?"

谢谢你，这让我感到很安慰。我现在可以走了吗？

"Just one more thing." Ritsuko replied, reaching into a small refrigerator by her desk and pulling out a small ampoule of clear liquid. Deftly she broke the top off and drew out the contents using a syringe she retrieved from her desk drawer.

"还有一件事。" 律子回答道，伸手从桌旁的小冰箱里取出一个装有透明液体的小安瓿。她熟练地折断顶部，用从抽屉里拿出的注射器抽取了里面的内容物。

"Hold out your arm please, and try to relax."

请伸出您的手臂，尽量放松。

Asuka, well used to constant needles and inoculations from the time she was four, did as she was told. She winced slightly as the needle was pushed into the top of her left arm.

明日香自四岁起就习惯了频繁的针刺和接种，她按照吩咐做了。当针头扎进她左上臂时，她微微皱了皱眉。

"Thank you." Ritsuko said. "You may go."

"谢谢你。" 律子说道，"你可以走了。"

"Finally!" Asuka replied theatrically. "What was that anyway?"

"终于！" 明日香戏剧化地回答道，"那到底是什么啊？"

"Does it matter?" The blonde woman replied, removing her glasses and rubbing her eyes tiredly.

"这重要吗？"金发女子回答道，摘下眼镜疲惫地揉了揉眼睛。

"Probably not. Just interested to know what chemicals, or god knows what else, are being pumped into me on a daily basis." Asuka said lightly. "Call it human curiosity."

“可能不会。只是好奇想知道每天都有什么化学物质，或者天知道还有什么其他东西，被注入我体内。”明日香轻描淡写地说，“就当是人类的好奇心吧。”

"Very well." The doctor said with a weary sigh. "If you must know what I just injected into you is a newly approved for human testing, long acting, contraceptive. Current testing shows it to have at least a six month period of efficacy in non-human subjects."

"很好。" 医生带着疲惫的叹息说道，"如果你一定要知道，我刚刚给你注射的是一种新近获批进行人体测试的、长效避孕药。目前的测试显示，在非人类受试者中，其有效期至少可达六个月。"

"Contraceptive!" Asuka sputtered, her face heating with embarrassment. "Why would I need…"

"避孕药！" 明日香结巴地说道，脸上因尴尬而泛起红晕。"我怎么会需要……"

"Now, now Asuka." The white coated woman said. "There's no point thinking that you can hide something like this from me." The blonde doctor threw the empty syringe and ampoule into the waste. "Considering the current state of world affairs it really wouldn't do for us to have a pregnant pilot, now would it?"

"好了，好了，明日香。"那位身穿白大褂的女性说道，"你以为能瞒得过我这种事，根本没意义。"金发的医生将空注射器和安瓿扔进废物箱，"考虑到当前世界局势，我们可不能让一个怀孕的飞行员出现，不是吗？"

The German girl's mouth hung open and she was temporarily rendered speechless. Doctor Akagi, on the other hand, was wearing the first smile that Asuka had seen on the woman for the whole session.

德国女孩的嘴巴张得大大的，一时间竟说不出话来。而另一方面，阿卡吉医生却露出了整个会谈中飞鸟第一次见到的笑容。

"Just one thing, Asuka." She said, still wearing the same tired smile.

"就一件事，明日香。" 她说着，依旧带着那抹疲惫的微笑。

"Wh-what?" was the stammered reply.

"什、什么？" 是结结巴巴的回答。

"I thought that you said you would come to me for advice on, how did you so elegantly put it? Oh that's right; 'fucking an Ikari'?"

我记得你说过要来找我咨询，你是怎么优雅地表达来着？哦对了；就是那个“搞伊卡瑞”的事？

Asuka was glad she was still seated as she felt as if she surely would have fallen if she wasn't. She exhaled loudly and leaned on the table in front of her for support as the blood pounded in her ears. "Yeah… um… well I…"

明日香庆幸自己还坐着，因为她感觉如果没坐稳，肯定会摔倒。她大声地呼出一口气，倚靠在面前的桌子上以支撑自己，耳边传来血液的轰鸣声。“是啊……呃……那个，我……”

"Don't bother." Ritsuko interrupted with a weary sigh. "Anything I could tell you about the Ikaris, or anyone else for that matter, would be more in the form of a sad and cautionary tale about expectation versus reality. Shinji seems like a nice boy. I don't think that you'll need any of the advice that someone like me could possibly give you."

"别费心了。" 律子带着疲惫的叹息打断道，"关于碇家，或者其他人，我能告诉你的，多半是一个关于期望与现实落差的悲伤而警示的故事。真嗣看起来是个好孩子。我想你不需要像我这样的人可能给你的任何建议。"

Asuka was nonplussed by the other woman's candour as well as the seemingly defeated aura that surrounded the good doctor. She had never seen the great Ritsuko Akagi anything other than strong and in control. Indeed the two of them had butted heads more often than not since Asuka's return. Now the life and energy seemed to be draining visibly from the other woman. She knew that Ritsuko's end was one of bitterness and betrayal at the hands of both Gendo Ikari and her mother. Now, for the first time, she felt some sympathy towards the faux blonde. Possibly the most intelligent person alive in the world at that time brought so low by her hunger for acceptance and love.

明日香对那位女士的坦率以及围绕着好医生的那种似乎被打败的氛围感到困惑。她从未见过伟大的赤木律子除了坚强和掌控之外的样子。事实上，自从明日香回来后，她们俩的冲突就屡见不鲜。现在，生命力和活力似乎正从那位女士身上明显地流失。她知道，赤木律子的结局是苦涩和背叛，这都拜源渡和她的母亲所赐。现在，她第一次对这位假金发女郎产生了些许同情。可能是当时世界上最聪明的人，却因渴望被接纳和爱而沦落至此。

"Uh…" Asuka stammered. "Th-thanks doc…"

"呃…" 明日香结巴地说，"谢…谢谢医生…"

"You're welcome, Asuka." The blonde scientist shook herself, seeming to suddenly collect her thoughts. "Well now..." She said, brushing distractedly at her white coat. "Look at me still talking when there's science to do…" She said with a false brightness. "Run along young lady, I've got more important things to worry about than your love life."

"不客气，明日香。" 金发科学家摇了摇头，仿佛突然间整理好了思绪。"那么现在..." 她边说边心不在焉地拂了拂白大褂。"瞧我，还在聊天，明明有科学研究要做……" 她故作轻快地说道。"快去忙吧，小姑娘，我可有比你的恋爱生活更重要的事情要操心。"

"So…" Asuka said, meeting the tired green eyes of Ritsuko Akagi. "I-I suppose you'll tell Gendo all about this?"

“那么…”明日香说道，迎上了绫波丽疲惫的绿色眼眸。“我-我想你会把这一切都告诉碇源堂吧？”

Ritsuko grimaced. "Knowing him, he already knows… If he doesn't… he won't hear it from me. Now, run along." She said once more. "And come back to see me in six months for your booster."

律子皱了皱眉。“以我对他的了解，他肯定已经知道了……如果他不知道……那也不会是从我这里听到的。好了，快去吧。”她再次说道，“六个月后回来找我打加强针。”

"Th-thank you… Doctor Akagi." Asuka said breathlessly, before opening the door and fleeing from the suddenly tiny office.

"谢、谢谢你……赤木医生。" 明日香气喘吁吁地说完，便打开门，从突然显得狭小的办公室逃了出去。

Ritsuko lit a cigarette, drew deeply from it, then let the dense smoke curl up from her lips into the stale office air. "Of course, six months from now," She said to the empty room. "It's highly unlikely that I'll be here to give it to you, or that you'll still be around to need it."

律子点燃了一支烟，深深吸了一口，随后让浓烟从唇间袅袅升起，融入办公室沉闷的空气中。“当然，六个月后，”她对着空荡荡的房间说道，“我极不可能还在这里把它交给你，或者你也不太可能还在这里需要它。”

Stubbing out the cigarette she returned to her computer monitor and was soon lost in the labyrinth of reports and data that the MAGI constantly streamed across her portal.

她掐灭了香烟，回到电脑显示器前，很快便沉浸在 MAGI 不断通过她的门户传输的报告和数据迷宫中。

She wiped the mirror clear of the steam and condensation that poured out of the nearby shower block.

她擦去了镜子上的蒸汽和凝结水珠，这些水汽是从附近的淋浴间涌出的。

Asuka splashed more water on her face from the washbasin. She had headed straight to the locker rooms to try to compose herself after her medical exam with Doctor Akagi. She looked in the mirror to see a wide-eyed redhead staring back at her, her face still red and blotchy looking from the heat of her embarrassment. With her level of distraction she failed to notice that the sound of the running shower had ceased.

明日香从洗手盆中又泼了些水到脸上。在经历了赤木医生的体检后，她径直前往更衣室试图平复心情。她望向镜子，只见一个睁大眼睛的红发女孩回望着她，脸颊依旧因羞愧而泛红，显得有些斑驳。由于心神不宁，她没有注意到淋浴的水声已经停止。

"Come on, Asuka!" She said to her reflection. "Get it together!"

"加油，明日香！" 她对着镜子中的自己说，"振作起来！"

"Pilot Soryu." "翔龙飞行员。"

"Aieee!" Asuka squealed in surprise as she spun around.

"哎呀！" 明日香惊叫一声，转身看去。

Standing across the change room from her was the First Child, still dripping water from her shower onto the tiled floor and holding a towel in her right hand.

站在更衣室另一端的是第一适格者，她刚从淋浴间出来，水珠滴落在瓷砖地面上，右手还拿着一条毛巾。

"Pilot Soryu." Rei repeated. "You are in distress?"

"驾驶员 Soryu。" 绫重复道，"你遇到麻烦了吗？"

"Geez!" Asuka exclaimed, trying to recover her composure. "What the hell is it with you and the casual nudity?"

"天哪！" 明日香惊呼道，试图恢复镇定。"你这动不动就裸露的习惯是怎么回事？"

"I fail to understand what…"

我无法理解究竟是什么……

"Well, obviously!" Asuka interrupted. "Just put some freaking clothes on for god's sake! Sheesh! We're living in a society here! There are basic rules and standards that we need to abide by!"

“哎呀，显然啊！”明日香打断道，“拜托你穿点衣服吧，真是的！我们可是生活在社会里啊！有些基本的规矩和标准得遵守吧！”

"Very well, if it will help to assuage your discomfort." Rei answered as she began to dry herself off and put on her school uniform.

"很好，如果这能缓解你的不适。" 丽回答道，同时开始擦干身体并穿上校服。

The Second Child let out a heavy sigh as she continued to dry off her own face and hands. "Why me?" She muttered.

二女儿一边继续擦干自己的脸和手，一边重重地叹了口气。“为什么是我？”她喃喃自语。

"Are you not happy with what you already have?" The First Child asked from across the room. "You would appear to have much that others would covet."

"你难道不满足于你已经拥有的吗？" 第一个孩子从房间的另一头问道，"你似乎拥有许多别人会羡慕的东西。"

"What are you on about, Wondergirl?" Asuka replied, turning around to face the blue haired First Child.

"你在说什么呢，奇迹少女？" 明日香回答道，转过身来面对着那位蓝发的第一适格者。

"You take great pride in piloting Eva, you foster a large following of admiring students at our school and you have also become emotionally and, I suspect, physically close to Pilot Ikari in recent times." Rei replied. "Are these not things in which you would find happiness, Pilot Soryu?"

"你在驾驶 Eva 方面感到非常自豪，你在我们学校培养了一大批仰慕你的学生，而且最近你与碇真嗣飞行员在情感上，我猜想，也在身体上变得亲近。" 绫波丽回答道，"这些难道不是会让你感到幸福的事情吗，惣流·明日香·兰格雷飞行员？"

Asuka's eyes narrowed. "So that's what this is really about!"

明日香眯起了眼睛。“原来这才是真正的原因！”

The Blue haired girl finished fastening her dress and frowned at the question. "I do not understand."

蓝发女孩系好裙子后，对着问题皱起了眉头。“我不明白。”

"You like Shinji, don't you?" The redhead said accusingly.

"你喜欢真嗣，对吧？" 红发女孩指责地说。

The blue haired girl tilted her head to one side and seemed to consider this for several moments. "Yes. I believe that I do indeed 'like' Pilot Ikari, as you put it. His wellbeing is important to me."

蓝发女孩将头歪向一边，似乎沉思了片刻。“是的，我相信正如你所说，我的确‘喜欢’碇真嗣。他的安康对我来说很重要。”

'So!" Asuka said, pointing a finger at the other pilot. "You're jealous of me and Shinji, of what we have. Aren't you?"

“所以！”明日香说道，用手指着另一位驾驶员。“你嫉妒我和真嗣，嫉妒我们所拥有的。不是吗？”

"No." Rei finally pronounced after another lengthy pause. "What you have with Pilot Ikari would not be… suitable for me. I merely hope and wish for his continued happiness. That is all."

"不。" 经过又一段漫长的停顿后，绫终于开口了。"你和碇驾驶员之间的关系对我来说并不……合适。我只希望并祝愿他能继续幸福。仅此而已。"

"Really? Is that really all?"

"真的吗？就这些吗？"

"Of course." Rei replied. "Is that not enough?"

"当然。" 蕾伊回答道，"这还不够吗？"

Asuka gave a short, but relieved, laugh. "If you really do care about him, then for god's sake I've told you before, call him Shinji!"

明日香发出了一声短促却释然的笑声，“如果你真的在乎他，那我之前就告诉过你了，看在上帝的份上，叫他真嗣吧！”

"Would that make him happy?" Rei asked with a hint of uncertainty in her voice.

"那会让他开心吗？" 零带着一丝不确定问道。

"Yes, Wondergirl, I do believe that it would make him happy! It would also piss me off much less if you did so as well!"

是的，神奇女孩，我相信这会让他高兴的！如果你也这么做，我也会少生很多气！

The blue haired girl nodded. "Then I shall try to remember to do as you ask."

蓝发女孩点了点头。“那我会尽量记住，按照你的要求去做。”

"Thank you" Asuka replied with a smile. "You know something, Wondergirl…" She continued. "One day… you and I might just realise that we have more in common that you'd think!" The redhead stuck out her hand towards Rei's own. Much to Asuka's annoyance the blue haired First Child merely stared back at her, expressionless.

"谢谢你"，明日香微笑着回答。"你知道吗，奇迹女孩……"她继续说道，"有一天……你和我可能会意识到，我们之间的共同点比你想象的要多！"红发女孩向绫波伸出手。令明日香恼火的是，蓝发的第一适格者只是面无表情地盯着她。

"Hmph." Asuka said withdrawing her hand. "Today, however, is not that day."

"哼。" 明日香说着，收回了手。"但今天不是那一天。"

The two pilots were still staring awkwardly at each other when the Angel Alert siren began to blare loudly above them, and throughout the facility.

两位飞行员还在尴尬地互相对视时，天使警报的警笛声在他们上方以及整个设施内大声响起。

Asuka watched critically as Unit 02's maintenance crew scrambled over the red giant, making sure that the Evangelion was ready for battle. Coolant lines were disconnected and heavy steel gantries swung away from the red mechanoid's colossal form. Standing just a few metres away a coverall wearing tech operated the joysticks of a portable control panel. He expertly guided the sleek white entry plug down from its cradle and towards the small set of metal steps that she would mount in just a few minutes to enter the plug herself.

明日香目光锐利地注视着二号机的维修团队在红色巨人身上忙碌，确保这台福音战士为战斗做好准备。冷却液管道被断开，沉重的钢制步道从红色机甲的庞大身躯旁移开。几米开外，一名身穿连体工作服的技术人员操作着便携式控制面板上的操纵杆。他熟练地引导着流线型的白色插入栓从支架下降，朝向她几分钟后将踏上的那组金属阶梯，以便进入插入栓内部。

She heard footsteps approaching her from behind. Even in his soft plug suited feet there was no mistaking the Third Child's walk as he trudged across the honeycomb mesh of the gangway.

她听到身后有脚步声接近。即使穿着柔软的插头服，也无法错认第三适格者的步伐，他正踏过通道上的蜂窝状网格。

"It's just not fair!" He grumbled as he stopped beside her.

"这太不公平了！" 他嘟囔着停在她旁边。

The redhead continued to watch the progress of her entry plug. Not that she was worried about it. Hayashi was a consummate professional. Her whole team took great pride in the work that they did maintaining 'Akai-chan' as they affectionately referred to the red Eva. She smiled to herself. It was in good hands.

红发少女继续观察着她的插入栓进展。并非她对此感到担忧，林是一位技艺精湛的专业人士。她的整个团队都为维护他们亲切称之为“红色小家伙”的红色 EVA 所做的工作感到自豪。她暗自微笑，知道它正被妥善照料。

"Now now, Shinji-kun." Asuka said, finally turning and putting her plug-suited hands on either side of his face. "Don't pout. I'll pound this stupid Angel into the dirt and be back in time for dinner!"

"好啦好啦，真嗣君。"明日香终于转过身来，将她穿着插入栓服的双手放在他的脸颊两侧，"别撅嘴了。我会把这个愚蠢的天使打得落花流水，然后准时回来吃晚饭的！"

"Yeah… but.." 是啊…但是…

"But what?" She interrupted with a raised eyebrow. "You think that I can't take down one measly Angel without big manly Shinji riding in to save the day?

"但什么？"她挑起眉毛打断道，"你以为我不能独自击败一个小小的天使，非得靠高大威猛的真嗣来拯救世界吗？"

"No… but.." "不…但是…"

"Think very carefully about the next few syllables that you utter, Third Child!" Asuka said with mock ire.

"好好想想你接下来要说的几个音节，第三适格者！" 明日香带着假装的怒气说道。

"I know you're the best Pilot, Asuka." Shinji paused briefly as the maintenance crew's leading hand approached them with Unit 02's ready report for Asuka to approve. She nodded at the man, before quickly scanning the screen, then she signed the pad of his handset, before handing it back to him with a smile. "I-I'd just feel better if I was up there with you too."

"我知道你是最好的飞行员，明日香。" 真嗣停顿了一下，此时维修队的领班正拿着二号机的准备报告向他们走来，等待明日香审批。她向那人点头示意，迅速扫了一眼屏幕，随后在手持设备的平板上签了字，微笑着将设备递还给他。"我……我只是觉得如果我也能和你一起上去会更好。"

Asuka leaned forward and planted a fervent kiss on his lips. "You heard Misato." She said. "Your father has ordered Unit 01 to be kept on active standby. Wondergirl and I will sortie this time. My big brave Shinji will just have to be content with the girls getting the glory this time around!""

明日香倾身向前，热情地吻上了他的唇。“你听到了，美里说。”她说道，“你父亲命令零号机保持待命状态。这次由我和奇迹女孩出击。我勇敢的大男孩真嗣，这次只好让女孩们独享荣耀了！”

"B-But my father wouldn't even hear me out…" Shinji said, ignoring her attempt at humour. "I mean, you're injured and Rei… Unit 00 hasn't even been fully repaired yet! He's just punishing me for defying him in the last battle…"

"可是我父亲甚至都不听我解释……" 真嗣说道，无视了她试图幽默的尝试。"我的意思是，你受了伤，而零……零号机甚至还没有完全修复好！他只是在惩罚我上一次战斗中违抗他的命令……"

"Shinji…" "真嗣……"

"He's only doing it because he's pissed at me because I spoke back to him in the last battle!" He continued, pounding the railing with his fist. "He's putting you and Rei in danger just to teach me a lesson! How can he be so cruel? I just want…"

他这么做只是因为他对我上次战斗中顶撞他感到愤怒！他继续说着，拳头重重地砸在栏杆上。“他把你和丽置于危险之中，只是为了给我一个教训！他怎么能这么残忍？我只是想……”

"Oh my god!" She interrupted melodramatically. "You mean that your father's being an asshole? Stop the fucking presses!"

“哦，我的天！”她戏剧性地打断道，“你是说你爸是个混蛋？快他妈停下印刷机！”

"Haha…" Shinji gave a strained laugh. "Yeah…I know... but…"

"哈哈…" 真嗣勉强地笑了笑。"是啊…我知道…但是…"

"Everybody here knows that it's just his petty way of getting at you. So fucking what? In case you might have forgotten I am Asuka Langley Soryu. This Angel will be pâté before it ever knows what's hit it!"

这里的人都知道，他只是用这种小手段来针对你。那又怎样？以防你忘了，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。这个天使还没明白怎么回事，就会变成肉酱！

"I-I hope so, Asuka." “我-我希望如此，明日香。”

"I know so, Shinji." She replied. "You think that I'd let something so clichéd as dying in battle just after finally sleeping with you ever happen to me? I mean, just what kind of girl do you think that I am?" She asked with a grin.

"我知道的，真嗣。" 她回答道，"你以为我会让那种俗套的情节——刚和你睡过就战死沙场——发生在我身上吗？我是说，你到底把我当成什么样的女孩了？" 她带着一丝坏笑问道。

"Yeah, I guess that you're right!" Shinji answered with an endearing blush and a much less certain smile of his own.

"是啊，我想你是对的！" 真嗣带着惹人喜爱的脸红和远不如之前确定的笑容回答道。

"You know it!" Asuka said launching into a fierce embrace of the startled young man. Quickly he returned her hug and the two teenagers stood there for over a minute until the sheepish interruption of the foreman, letting them know that Unit 02's plug was in position for her to enter.

"你懂的！" 明日香说着，猛地抱住了惊愕的年轻人。他很快回应了她的拥抱，两个少年就这样站了一分多钟，直到工头尴尬地打断他们，告知二号机的插入栓已就位，她可以进入了。

She gave Shinji a quick but passionate kiss. "We'll continue this when I get back!" She said meaningfully after finally breaking off. "I've got an Angel to go kill!"

她迅速而热情地吻了真嗣一下，最后分开时意味深长地说：“等我回来我们再继续！”“我得去杀个使徒了！”

With a bound she ran up the steps to her plug and with a quick backward glance and a wave she was lost from view to the bewildered Third Child.

她一跃而起，冲上台阶，插上电源，迅速回头一瞥并挥手告别，便从困惑的第三子视线中消失了。

Despite her words of confidence, he still couldn't shake the feeling of apprehension that was lodged in his stomach.

尽管她信心满满的话语，他仍无法摆脱那股盘踞在胃里的忐忑不安。

## Chapter 14: Engage

Second part of two part update.

两部分更新的第二部分。

Unbroken 坚不可摧

Chapter 14 第 14 章

Engage! 开始行动！

"Let me make one thing perfectly clear, Third! This is not a fluke!"

让我把话说清楚，第三！这绝非偶然！

The redhead smiled to herself at the warmth of that memory.

红发女子独自微笑，沉浸在那份温暖的回忆中。

"Asuka! Focus! What the hell is wrong with you?"

飞鸟！集中精神！你到底怎么了？

She was broken out of her reverie by the tension filled voice of her guardian and commanding officer. The scathing reply that she had formed was quashed before it started by the almost continuous rumble of approaching explosions. Which could be felt even through the massive standing frame of her Evangelion.

她被监护人和指挥官那充满紧张的声音从沉思中惊醒。她本想反唇相讥，但还未开口，就被接连不断的爆炸声所淹没，那震动甚至能透过她所驾驶的巨大福音战士机体传递过来。

"Rei," She heard Misato's voice say urgently over the communication channel. "Ready the sniper-rifle; on my mark!"

绫，" 她听到美里急切的声音通过通讯频道传来，"准备好狙击步枪；听我指令！

"Yes, Ma'am." She heard the First Child reply calmly.

"是，女士。" 她听到第一适格者平静地回答。

'Too goddamn calmly' Asuka thought to herself irritably

'Asuka 烦躁地想道：“太他妈冷静了。”'.

"Asuka?" The Major's tense face appeared in a window before her. Asuka could see the sling that her guardian still wore on her arm.

"Asuka？" 少校紧张的面孔出现在她面前的窗口中。Asuka 可以看到她的监护人手臂上仍然挂着的吊带。

"Yeah?" 是吗？

"Don't…" Misato seemed to stumble over the words. "Don't get…" Yet another awkward pause hung heavily in the air. "Just be careful, okay?"

别…" 似乎米萨托在斟酌着言辞。"别太…" 又一次尴尬的停顿沉重地悬在空气中。"只是要小心，好吗？

"Yeah… careful." Asuka reply dripped with sarcasm. "That'll be sure to beat that nasty old Angel! How the hell do you think I'm going to defeat "The most powerful Angel we've yet seen" by being goddamn careful?"

是啊…小心点。" 明日香的回答充满了讽刺。"那肯定能打败那个讨厌的老使徒！你倒是说说，我怎么可能通过小心谨慎来击败"我们迄今为止遇到的最强大的使徒"呢？

Misato winced slightly under the redhead's scorn, before her expression hardened. "Asuka…" She began warningly.

在红发少女的嘲讽下，葛城美里微微皱眉，随后表情变得坚定。"明日香…" 她开始警告地说。

The explosion that cut off the Major's reply was far more deafening than Asuka had remembered.

那次打断少校回答的爆炸声，比明日香记忆中的还要震耳欲聋。

"Scheiße!" She swore as the world shook violently around her.

"该死！" 她咒骂着，周围的世界剧烈摇晃。

"It blasted through all twenty-two layers of special armour in one hit!" The glasses wearing tech, the one with the name she could never remember, screamed ridiculously over the open channel.

它一击穿透了二十二层特殊装甲！戴着眼镜的技术员，那个名字她永远记不住的人，在开放频道中夸张地尖叫着。

'No shit…' She thought grimly as she watched the black cloud of smoke and debris billowing outward and down from the Geo-front's domed ceiling. 'Tell me something I don't already know.'

'废话…' 她阴沉地想着，同时看着黑烟和碎片从地下都市的穹顶向外翻滚而下。'告诉我一些我还不知道的事。'

Instinctively Asuka ducked in her entry plug as what had seconds before been a sizeable area of Tokyo 03's Central Business District began to rain down throughout the Geofront in a lethal hail of concrete, glass and steel. If it wasn't for the LCL she was sure that her face and body would be slick with sweat. She remembered just how powerful this Angel was, just how easily it has disabled Unit 02 and cast her aside like an afterthought. 'Not this time.'

本能地，明日香在插入栓内一缩，只见片刻前还是东京 03 中央商务区的一大片区域，开始在 Geofront 内如致命的冰雹般倾泻而下，混凝土、玻璃和钢铁交织。若非有 LCL 液，她确信自己的脸和身体定会因汗水而湿滑。她回忆起这只使徒的强大，它是如何轻易地使二号机瘫痪，将她像事后想法一样抛诸脑后。'这次不会了。'

She hefted the enormous progressive axe in the Evangelion's hands as she gazed out of the cockpit, her mouth unconsciously set in a fierce grin. At least she had managed one small victory already. After much arguing, pleading, threatening and god help her even reasoning with Misato, Asuka had finally got her way with the weapons fit out of the two Eva units. It was markedly different from the previous engagement with this, the most physically powerful of all of the Angels. It needed to be, she mused. Those oversized pop-guns were worse than useless last time.

她操控着福音战士举起那巨大的前掠式战斧，从驾驶舱向外望去，嘴角不自觉地挂上了一抹凶狠的笑容。至少她已经取得了一个小小的胜利。经过一番激烈的争论、恳求、威胁，甚至祈求上帝保佑，她甚至动用了理性与美里交涉，明日香终于让两台 Eva 的武器配置如愿以偿。这与之前与这只最强物理力量的使徒交战时的配置大相径庭。她沉思，这必须有所不同。上次那些过大的玩具枪简直比无用还糟糕。

She turned and looked back at the still damaged Unit 00. The blue Evangelion was lying prone, partially obscured behind a small rise in the landscape of the Geo-Front. The enormous bipod supported barrel of the Evangelion sized sniper rifle protruding in front of it as its pilot drew a bead on the epicentre of the explosion.

她转过身，回望仍受损的零号机。那台蓝色的福音战士正俯卧着，部分被地底都市地形中的一处小隆起遮挡。巨大的双足支架支撑着福音战士尺寸的狙击步枪枪管，其驾驶员正瞄准爆炸中心。

"This time I'm ready for you, Engel." Asuka snarled. There would be no humiliation and easy defeat this time. The Asuka Langley Soryu that had faced down this Angel, the aggressive but fragile girl that had fallen before the might of Zeruel, was gone. Burnt away in the bloody crucible of Impact. That girl was as dead as the world that she had left behind her on that desolate shore.

这一次，我已准备好迎接你，恩格尔。"明日香咆哮道。这次不会再有羞辱和轻易的失败。那个曾面对过这位天使、那个好斗却脆弱、在塞路尔强大力量面前倒下的明日香·兰格雷·索西尔已不复存在。她在冲击的血腥熔炉中被焚烧殆尽。那个女孩，如同她留在那荒凉海岸上的世界一样，已经死去。

"Ikuhayo, Asuka." Asuka muttered to herself as she gripped the control yokes even more tightly, causing Unit 02's hands to flex around the enormous carbon-titanium shaft of the axe. Smaller pieces of debris were still falling around her, but she paid them no heed. Her gaze was locked on centre the massive dome of the Geo-front.

"伊库哈约，明日香。" 明日香低声自语，双手更加紧握操纵杆，使得二号机的手也随之紧握住巨大的碳钛合金斧柄。四周仍有小片残骸坠落，但她毫不在意。她的目光紧紧锁定在巨大的地下都市穹顶中心。

Waiting. 等待中。

When the dust finally cleared she narrowed her eyes as the impossibly massive body of the 14th Angel breeched the jagged rent in the high ceiling. There was no more time for worrying about the million trivial issues and annoyances of daily life or even the success or failure of her attempts to affect the course of Impact and human evolution.

当尘埃最终落定，她眯起眼睛，看着第 14 使徒那不可思议的庞大身躯从高高的天花板上参差不齐的裂口中破出。再也没有时间去担心日常生活中的百万琐事和烦恼，甚至她试图影响冲击和人类进化进程的成败。

There was only now. 只有现在。

She was Asuka Langley Soryu. She would not, could not, be defeated again.

她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。她绝不会再被击败，也不可能再被击败。

The remote gun and missile emplacements that lined the Geofront erupted in noise and flames as they attempted to slow the Angel's progress by launching every piece of ordinance they could in its direction. Hundreds of explosive concussions shook the air around the Evas as each projectile impacted futilely against the giant's A-T field before ever touching its squat and ugly body.

环绕第三新东京市 Geofront 的远程炮台和导弹阵地爆发出轰鸣与火焰，试图通过发射所有能用的弹药来延缓使徒的推进。数百次爆炸的冲击波在 EVA 机体周围震荡，每一发弹头都徒劳地撞击在巨型使徒的 A-T 力场上，未能触及它那矮胖丑陋的身躯。

Asuka, and indeed all of those watching, knew that the best that this show of strength could ever hope to achieve was to distract the target, even then only for a moment at best. But it was in the nature of humanity to throw all it could into the fray, she could hardly blame the officer in charge of the gun crews for his enthusiasm.

明日香以及所有目睹这一幕的人都知道，这种力量的展示所能期望的最佳结果不过是分散目标的注意力，而且最多只能维持片刻。但人类的本性就是全力以赴投入战斗，她很难责怪负责炮组的军官所表现出的热情。

As suddenly as the barrage started, it stopped. Giant extractor fans built into the Geofront walls sucked the clearing smoke away from the battlefield as the 14th Angel moved inexorably forward.

炮火如同突如其来般开始，又戛然而止。Geofront 墙壁内嵌的巨型抽风机将战场上的烟雾迅速吸走，与此同时，第 14 使徒正不可阻挡地向前推进。

Asuka concentrated all of her will on neutralising the enemy's A-T Field. Slowly the behemoth moved forward. Its bulk hanging improbably in the early evening air.

明日香集中全部意志力于中和敌人的 A-T 力场。慢慢地，这头巨兽向前移动，其庞大的身躯不可思议地悬浮在傍晚的空气中。

"Engage!" Misato shouted over the coms channel.

"开始行动！" 美里通过通讯频道大声喊道。

With an ear-splitting concussion the damaged Unit 00 fired the Evangelion-sized rifle. The armour-piercing projectile, shedding its sabot as it exited the barrel, roared across the Geofront. Asuka's Eva-assisted vision helped her trace its trajectory as it screeched towards the target. For a fraction of a second the force against her own A-T Field grew in intensity, before the blast of the shell exploding harmlessly against the Angel rocked the Geo-Front.

伴随着震耳欲聋的撞击声，受损的零号机发射了与福音战士尺寸相匹配的步枪。穿甲弹在出膛时甩掉其弹托，咆哮着穿越第三新东京市地下的巨大空间。明日香的 EVA 辅助视觉帮助她追踪弹道，只见它尖啸着朝目标飞去。有那么一瞬间，她感受到自己的 A-T 力场受到的冲击力增强，紧接着，炮弹在天使面前爆炸，冲击波震撼了整个地下都市，却未造成伤害。

"Scheiße!" Asuka swore as she felt Unit 02 being buffeted by the shock wave. "Fat lot of good that did!"

该死！" 明日香咒骂着，感受到二号机被冲击波震得摇晃。"这有什么用！

Before she could say anything more Unit 00 quickly cycled the bolt of its rifle, firing two more rounds in rapid succession at the Angel. Again, despite Asuka's own efforts to neutralise it, they also impacted harmlessly, to the Angel at least, against the A-T field of the target.

在她还没来得及再说什么之前，零号机迅速地给步枪上了膛，对着使徒连续发射了两发子弹。然而，尽管明日香也努力试图将其击倒，这些子弹依旧无害地击中了目标的 A-T 力场，至少对使徒来说是无害的。

"Dammit!" She heard Misato curse over the coms. "We can't seem to touch this thing!"

该死！" 她听到美里在通讯中咒骂道，"我们似乎无法触及这个东西！

"Energy spike coming from target!" One of the bridge crew screamed, the sound of his voice filling her plug.

"目标处出现能量峰值！"桥上的一名船员尖叫道，他的声音充满了她的插头。

"Rei, Look out!" Misato yelled as the Angel's eyes began to glow white and a high pitched keening wail filled the air.

"绫波，小心！"美里大喊，此时使徒的眼睛开始发出白光，一阵高亢的哀鸣声充斥着空气。

"Goddamn Wondergirl is a sitting target with that ridiculous rifle!" The thought flashed in and out of Asuka's mind in an instant. Without a further consideration she clenched the control yokes and willed the red Evangelion forward.

"该死的神奇女孩，拿着那把可笑的步枪，简直就是个活靶子！"这个念头在明日香的脑海中一闪而过。她毫不犹豫地握紧操纵杆，驱使红色福音战士向前冲去。

"Asuka, no!" Misato yelled in vain at her over the open channel.

"明日香，不要！"美里在公开频道中徒劳地对她喊道。

But there was no reaching the red juggernaut or its pilot. Large chunks of rock and debris flew up behind it, its feet digging into the soil of the Geofront as it pushed forward at ever increasing speed.

但无法触及那红色巨兽及其驾驶员。大块的岩石和碎片在其后方飞溅，它的脚深深扎入第三新东京市地下的土壤中，以越来越快的速度推进。

The Angel, its eyes now beginning to glow ominously, appeared to pay the approaching Evangelion little heed as it focussed on the still prone Unit 00. The blue Evangelion reloaded another round into its rifle and fired yet again, causing Asuka to instinctively duck as the sonic boom of the shell passing overhead rocked her entry plug. Once again the round impacted against the Angel's AT-Field causing it no discernable damage at all.

使徒的双眼开始闪烁着不祥的光芒，似乎对逼近的福音战士不甚在意，而是专注于仍倒地的零号机。蓝色福音战士再次装填子弹，又一次开火，炮弹掠过头顶的音爆让明日香本能地低头躲避。这一发再次击中使徒的绝对领域，却未造成任何明显伤害。

Misato, back on the bridge, watched the giant screen in a mixture of hope and horror as Unit 02 continued its headlong charge. The red Eva moved incredibly quickly, progressive axe held high, pushing headlong towards the floating bulk of the 14th Angel. The enemy seemed to have its attention fixated on Unit 00 and its continued attacks. Maybe there was a slim chance Asuka could get though. Maybe they wouldn't need Shinji and Unit 01 to get involved. 'Just maybe…'

回到指挥室的葛城美里，目不转睛地盯着巨型屏幕，心中交织着希望与恐惧，因为二号机正不顾一切地冲锋陷阵。红色的 EVA 以惊人的速度前进，手中的进步速度之斧高高举起，直奔悬浮着的第十四使徒而去。敌人似乎完全专注于对零号机的持续攻击。或许，明日香还有一线机会突破重围。或许，他们并不需要真嗣和初号机介入。'或许……'

The keening wail coming from the target grew louder and louder. It reached an ear-splitting crescendo as it sent a devastating blast at the prone Unit 00. The earth around the blue Evangelion seemed to distort and liquefy beneath it before the whole embankment was transformed into a rapidly expanding cloud of dust and smoke crowned by a cross-shaped pillar of white fire.

来自目标的哀嚎声越来越响，当它向俯卧的零号机发起毁灭性冲击时，达到了震耳欲聋的高潮。在蓝色福音机周围，大地似乎在其下方扭曲液化，随后整个堤岸化作了一团迅速膨胀的尘烟，顶端冠以十字形的白色火焰之柱。

"Rei!" Misato screamed without even realising. None of the other personnel manning the bridge payed her exclamation any mind as they all stood in transfixed horror at the sight.

"丽！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷不自觉地尖叫出声。然而，桥上其他工作人员都沉浸在惊恐的凝视中，对她的惊呼置若罔闻。

"What's the pilot's status?"

飞行员的状况如何？

"Life signs nominal, though it appears that she's unconscious, Ma'am." Maya replied, her voice cracking under the strain. "Unit 00 showing heavy damage to 64 out of 108 sectors. Life support is stable."

生命迹象正常，但看起来她已经失去意识了，女士。" 玛雅回答道，她的声音因压力而颤抖。"00 号机体有 64 个区域遭受严重损坏。生命维持系统稳定。

"Roger." Misato replied, as long as Rei was stable she was safer inside Unit 00 at that moment. Anyway, to send recovery teams out at this time would be sending those personnel to their probable deaths. "Come on Asuka…" She said fervently as she watched the Red Eva close on the Angel.

"收到。" 美里回应道，只要绫波稳定，她在 00 号机体内此刻就是安全的。无论如何，此时派遣救援队出去无异于让那些人员去送死。"加油，明日香……" 她热切地说着，注视着红色 Eva 逼近天使。

Unit 02 was almost within striking distance of the enemy now, the progressive axe held high to strike at its squat and ugly torso. Misato watched in desperate hope as Asuka closed the distance. Maybe if she could hit before the Angel could strike again with its energy beam there was some hope.

零号机此刻几乎已进入对敌人的攻击范围，高举着渐进式战斧，准备劈向那矮小丑陋的身躯。葛城美里怀着绝望中的希望注视着明日香逐渐逼近。或许，如果她能在天使再次发射能量光束前击中对方，还有一线生机。

The 14th Angel's arms unfurled on either side of its body. With impossible speed the right appendage shot out straight towards the red Evangelion.

第十四使徒的双臂在身体两侧展开。以难以置信的速度，其右臂直射向红色福音战士。

"Asuka!" Misato shouted at the screen.

"Asuka!" 美里对着屏幕喊道。

Amazingly, almost as if its pilot had foreseen that the Angel would attack in this manner, Unit 02 ducked and rolled beneath the arm, leaving it whizzing mere centimetres above its body. Staggering to its feet, with vegetation and debris still clinging to its body from the roll, the Evangelion regained its feet and once more continued its advance.

令人惊叹的是，仿佛驾驶员预见到使徒会以这种方式攻击，二号机俯身翻滚，让那只手臂在离其身体仅几厘米的地方呼啸而过。它挣扎着站起来，身上还粘着翻滚时沾上的植被和碎片，这台福音战士重新站稳，继续前进。

"Kill you!" Asuka's cry as she swung the progressive axe resounded over the speakers on the bridge.

"杀了你！" 明日香挥动前进之斧时的呼喊，通过舰桥上的扬声器回荡开来。

There was a reverberating concussion as the blade met with the Angel's hexagonal AT-Field. Sparks flew out from the point of impact and bounced off the ground and structures around them. Several of them igniting fires in the nearby forest.

当刀刃与天使的六边形 AT 力场相撞时，发出了一声回响的撞击声。火花从撞击点飞溅而出，弹跳在地面上和周围的建筑物上，其中一些点燃了附近的森林。

"Arrrrrrgh!" The Second Child screamed as she willed her Eva's AT-Field to neutralize her opponent's field. Slowly the axe head began sinking towards the Angels body. Slowly Asuka could feel her enemy's force weakening under the continuous pressure that she exerted against it. Slowly she felt that maybe she could beat this Angel. Maybe things would be different this time.

"啊——！"第二适格者尖叫着，她驱动自己的 EVA 的 AT 力场去中和对手的力场。慢慢地，斧头开始向天使的身体下沉。慢慢地，明日香能感觉到敌人的力量在持续的压力下减弱。慢慢地，她觉得也许这次她能打败这个天使。也许这次会有所不同。

"High energy reading from within target!" Came the cry over the communication channel.

"目标内部传来高能读数！"通讯频道中传来呼喊。

"Scheiße, not now!" She cried out as she felt the pressure against her own AT-Filed continue to give way. At the same time what could only be described as eye-holes within the Angel's mask began to glow with new intensity.

"该死，别是现在！" 她惊呼道，感觉到自己 AT 力场的压力正不断退让。与此同时，天使面具上那只能被形容为眼睛的孔洞开始以新的强度发光。

"Asuka, Lookout!" She heard Misato yell.

"明日香，小心！" 她听到美里大声喊道。

"Almost there!" She screamed in reply.

"就快到了！"她尖叫着回应。

In an instant the AT-Field in front of her vanished and the progressive axe, robbed of its barrier, slammed into the body of the Angel, leaving a deep scar on its carapace, though frustratingly failing to penetrate any deeper.

刹那间，她面前的 AT 力场消失了，失去屏障的进阶战斧猛击在使徒的躯体上，在其甲壳上留下一道深深的伤痕，却令人沮丧地未能穿透更深。

"Dieee!" She screamed as she swung the axe once more, putting all of the force she and her Eva could muster into the strike, but before she could land the killing blow the world around her turned white hot as the Angel blasted her Unit with the full force of its energy beam. She could feel, through her Evangelion, the searing heat as well as the impact of trees and boulders hitting her as Unit 02 was flung flailing across the Geo-front, landing in the centre of the lake with a massive splash and cloud of steam that joined the thickening pall of smoke from the burning forest.

"去死吧！"她尖叫着再次挥动战斧，倾尽自己和她的 Eva 所能汇聚的所有力量，但在她能给予致命一击之前，周围的世界变得白热化，使徒以其能量光束的全部威力轰击她的机体。通过她的福音战士，她能感受到那灼热的高温，以及树木和巨石撞击她的冲击，随着 02 号机在 Geo-front 上翻滚飞出，最终落入湖中央，激起巨大的水花和蒸汽云，与燃烧森林中愈发浓密的烟雾交织在一起。

Misato looked on aghast as Unit 02 failed to re-emerge from beneath the water.

当二号机未能从水下重新出现时，美里惊恐地注视着。

"Asuka!" 飞鸟！

"Misato!" Suddenly a new voice was heard over the speakers. She had forgotten that Shinji was hearing and seeing all of this as well as he sat waiting inside his Eva, which was still held on standby. "You have to let me fight!"

美里！"突然，一个新的声音通过扬声器传来。她忘了真嗣也在听着和看着这一切，他坐在他的 Eva 里等待着，Eva 仍处于待命状态。"你必须让我战斗！

"Shinji, I…" 真嗣，我…

"Please, Misato!" The Third Child interrupted her, his voice choked and desperate. "She's being killed out there; you have to let me go!"

求你了，美里！" 第三适格者打断了她，声音哽咽而绝望。"她在外面被杀害；你必须让我去！

"Denied." Came the flat tone of the Commander from above where Misato was standing, every face on the bridge turned to look at that distant figure as he spoke for the first time during the battle. "Unit 01 will remain on standby until the Angel breaches the fourth defensive barrier. There is no point wasting further assets on a battlefield where the enemy has such a clear advantage. Would you not agree, Major?"

"拒绝。"指挥官从高处传来平淡的声音，那里是葛城站立的位置。舰桥上的每个人都转头望向那个遥远的身影，这是他在战斗中首次开口。"零号机将继续待命，直到天使突破第四道防御屏障。在敌人占据如此明显优势的战场上，进一步消耗资源毫无意义。您不这么认为吗，少校？"

"But, Father…" 但是，父亲……

"Major?" The Commander repeated, ignoring his son's pleading.

"少校？"指挥官重复道，对他的儿子的恳求置若罔闻。

"Sir, I..." Misato began.

"女士，我..." 碇真嗣开始说道。

"Goddammit, Shinji!" Came an angry but welcome voice over the coms. "Stop always trying to be the big the big damn hero all of the freaking time! I can beat this Angel without your help, easy!"

"该死的，真嗣！"通讯中传来一个愤怒却令人安心的声音，"别总想着每次都当那个该死的大英雄！没有你的帮助，我也能轻松打败这个天使！"

"Asuka!" 飞鸟！

Groaning the redhead forced the Evangelion back to its feet and clear of the water, shaking her head roughly as she cleared her vision.

红发少女呻吟着，强迫福音战士重新站起来，并远离水面，她用力摇了摇头，以清除视线。

"Asuka, are you alright?"

“明日香，你还好吗？”

"Never better!" Asuka snarled as she faced the enemy once more, now from two hundred metres away. Unfortunately she had lost the axe, she noticed with a second's regret. Well, there was no point worrying about that. With a thought she opened the right pauldron and grabbed the progressive knife, the Eva's touch activating the weapon as it began to vibrate keenly.

"从未如此好过！" 明日香咆哮着再次面对敌人，这次距离两百米。不幸的是，她注意到自己已经失去了那把斧头，一瞬间感到遗憾。不过，担心这个也没用。她心念一动，打开了右肩甲，抓住了那把渐进式刀，Eva 的触碰激活了武器，使其开始敏锐地震动。

Though her body ached all over the Second Child ignored the pain and once again charged towards the Angel's massive bulk. Her unit closing the distance in mere seconds. Once again the Angel sent its razor-sharp arms flying out at her. This time she was knew what she had to do. Ducking just as it reached her, she grabbed the arm tightly in her Eva's left hand. "Nnng…" She grunted as the hot, sharp pain lanced through her own hand. She had to force herself to keep hold and focus to distract herself from how much it actually hurt. Blood was pouring from Unit 02's fist as it clenched around the Angel's fully extended arm.

尽管全身疼痛，第二适格者无视了痛苦，再次向天使庞大的身躯发起冲锋。她的机体在短短几秒内拉近了距离。天使又一次将锋利如刀的手臂向她挥去。这一次，她清楚自己该做什么。就在手臂即将触及她时，她俯身躲避，并用 EVA 的左手紧紧抓住了那只手臂。“嗯……”她闷哼一声，剧烈的灼痛感穿透了自己的手掌。她必须强迫自己坚持握住，集中精神以分散对实际痛苦的注意力。随着二号机紧握住天使完全伸出的手臂，鲜血从其拳头中涌出。

"Eat this!" She yelled as she pulled the Angel closer to her, ignoring how her flesh screamed at the sensation of the arm cutting deeper into what felt like her own flesh and bones. She figured that while she had it like this the Angel wouldn't be able to use its AT-Field to defend itself. Screaming to distract herself from the pain she swung the prog-knife with her right arm and wedged it into what could only be described as the Angel's shoulder joint, where its paper thin arm articulated from its squat torso.

"吃这个！"她大喊着，将天使拉近自己，不顾肉体因手臂深入而发出的撕裂感，仿佛切割的是自己的骨肉。她断定，如此一来，天使便无法运用其 AT 力场自卫。为了分散痛苦，她尖叫着，用右手挥动着前卫刀，将其深深插入那只能形容为天使肩关节的部位，那里连接着其扁平手臂与矮胖身躯。

Unit 02's feet dug deeply into the earth as its foe tried to pull itself free from its grasp, but Asuka would have none of that. Wedging the knife deeper she twisted and levered at the gaping wound the knife had made in what was one of the few vulnerable parts of Angel.

当敌人试图从 02 号机的掌控中挣脱时，它的脚深深地扎进了土地，但明日香决不允许。她将刀子更深地插入天使身上为数不多的脆弱部位的巨大伤口中，扭转并撬动，毫不留情。

"High energy reading detected within target!"

在目标内检测到高能量读数！

"No, not now!" Asuka cried, pushing the knife even deeper into the Angel.

"不，现在不行！" 明日香喊道，将刀子更深地刺入使徒体内。

As if in answer to her plea she felt a sickening sensation as the knife finally cut through the final angelic sinew and the Angel's arm separated from its body. Bright Angelic blood sprayed from the wound as a high keening wail rent the air. Freeing her own bloodied hand from the appendage Asuka forced Unit 02 into a crouch as she readied for the next assault. She could feel her enemy's fury at being wounded and could once again see the ominous glow from its empty eye sockets.

仿佛回应了她的恳求，当刀刃最终切断最后一根天使肌腱，天使的手臂与身体分离时，她感到一阵恶心。明亮的圣血从伤口喷涌而出，伴随着一声尖锐的哀鸣撕裂空气。阿苏卡将自己的血手从那断肢中抽出，迫使零号机蹲下，准备迎接下一波攻击。她能感受到敌人的愤怒，因为它受到了伤害，又能再次看到其空洞眼窝中不祥的光芒。

"Asuka, lookout!" Misato called out, rather redundantly Asuka thought to herself as she readied herself for the inevitable attack from her enemy.

"明日香，小心！" 尽管明日香觉得美里这声提醒有些多余，但她还是做好了迎接敌人必然攻击的准备。

Just as the wail from the Angel reached its deafening crescendo, Asuka forced unit 02 into a high jump into the air above it. Attempting to follow her rapidly changing trajectory, the Angel fired its beam wildly. Missing Unit 02's legs by several metres the beam blasted across the Geofront and vaporized nearly half of the water in the lake, adding yet more thick mist to the smoke and dust that was already filling the air.

正当天使的哀鸣达到震耳欲聋的高潮时，明日香强行让 02 号机高高跃起，飞至其上方。试图追踪她快速变化的轨迹，天使疯狂地发射光束。光束以数米之差错过了 02 号机的腿部，横扫第三新东京市地下的巨大空间，蒸发了湖中近半的水，使得本已弥漫的烟尘中又增添了浓重的雾气。

Unit 02 landed feet first onto the front of the Angel, forcing it back further from its goal. Grappling it with the Evas bloodied left hand Asuka kept hacking at the 'face' of the enemy with the prog knife still held tightly in the right. Her ears rang with the blood pounding in them and she knew she was screaming incoherently as she clung to the 14th Angel and pummelled it mercilessly.

二号机以脚先着地的方式猛然降落在使徒前方，迫使其离目标更远。阿苏卡用 EVA 血迹斑斑的左手紧紧抓住使徒，右手紧握着 prog knife 不断猛击敌人的“面孔”。耳中回荡着血液的轰鸣声，她知道自己正尖叫着，语无伦次地紧贴着第十四使徒，无情地痛击着。

She could hear Misato yelling something at her over the comm-channel, but the Major may as well have been speaking Urdu for all the attention and comprehension that the battle-crazed German girl gave it.

她能听到美里通过通讯频道对她大喊着什么，但对于这个战斗狂热的德国女孩来说，少校的话就像是在说乌尔都语一样，她既没注意也听不懂。

Suddenly the world became white heat again as Asuka felt herself flying through the air once more, less far this time though. 'Stupid, stupid' She cursed as she impacted the nearby wood, burning trees falling around her as she slid to a halt. She couldn't afford to lose her head in the heat of battle. This was one of the most dangerous and powerful Angels that she had faced in the past. The Angel that had nearly cost them Shinji.

突然间，世界再次化为一片炽白，明日香感觉自己又一次飞向空中，这次距离稍短。“愚蠢，真愚蠢。”她咒骂着，撞击到附近的树木上，燃烧的树木在她周围倒下，她滑行着停了下来。她不能在激战中失去理智。这是她过去遭遇过的最危险、最强大的使徒之一。那个差点让他们失去真嗣的使徒。

At least the Angel had not been able to fully charge its energy beam before it had hit her at point blank range. That small mercy meant that she had only been sent fifty metres or so away from her enemy. Fire clinging to the Evangelion and her ears ringing loudly, she pushed her Evangelion back out of the burning wood and charged back at the Angel. Her prog-knife now gone as well, her only extant plan being to rip the Angel to shreds with her bare hands.

至少，使徒在能量束未能完全充能的情况下，就以极近距离击中了她。这份微小的仁慈意味着她仅被击退了约五十米，远离了敌人。火焰附着在福音战士上，耳边轰鸣作响，她奋力将福音战士从燃烧的林木中推出，再次向使徒发起冲锋。此刻，她的程序刀已失，唯一剩下的计划便是用双手将使徒撕成碎片。

The 14th Angel just hung there in the air, just as impossibly as always. It seemed to be regarding her almost impassively. As if it was mildly curious about this ferocious little insect that it had to keep swatting away.

第十四使徒就那样悬浮在空中，一如既往地不可思议。它似乎近乎冷漠地注视着她，仿佛对这只不得不一再拍打的凶猛小昆虫感到些许好奇。

'Well, this little insect has drawn some blood.' Asuka thought to herself as she closed on the target. The Angel was still bleeding from its missing arm as well as several other wounds that she had managed to inflict on it. She grinned as she surveyed the damage she had already done.

'嗯，这只小虫子还真让我流了点血。' 明日香暗自思忖，逼近目标。天使仍在从失去的手臂和其他几处她造成的伤口中流血。她环顾自己已经造成的破坏，露出了得意的笑容。

"Now you are mine, Arschloch!" She cried as the Eva broke into a run.

"现在你归我了，混蛋！" 她喊道，随着 Eva 开始奔跑。

Her enemy seemed to be sitting there just waiting for her to come to it. Asuka didn't care. She was going to send it back to Hell, or wherever it was that Angels came from.

她的敌人似乎就坐在那里，静候她前来。明日香毫不在意。她决心将它打回地狱，或者天使所来自的任何地方。

Just as she closed the distance the Angel, with an almost casual grace, flicked its remaining arm out towards the advancing Eva. Unit 02 broke stride for a second as it reached out to grab the appendage.

就在她拉近距离之际，那天使以一种近乎随意的优雅，挥动着仅剩的手臂向逼近的 Eva 扫去。二号机在伸手抓取那肢体时，步伐不由得一滞。

She was just a fraction of a second too slow as the Angel's arm sliced through Unit 02's outstretched fingers and ripped into the Eva's abdominal armour plating, passing straight through and out through the back armour just as easily.

她只是慢了那么一刹那，天使的手臂便划过二号机伸出的手指，轻易地撕裂了 Eva 腹部的装甲板，穿透而过，又同样轻松地穿出了背部装甲。

The Second Child's scream of sheer agony tore at the hearts of the listening bridge crew.

第二个孩子的极度痛苦尖叫撕扯着倾听的桥上船员们的心。

Unit 02 came to a crashing halt as the arm withdrew, the blood-stained and battered Evangelion ploughing head first into the dirt.

随着手臂的抽回，二号机猛然停下，血迹斑斑、伤痕累累的福音战士一头扎进了泥土中。

"No." Asuka coughed, tasting blood in her mouth and feeling a powerful, sickening pain in her gut. A pain that was all too familiar to her from a battle in her past, and perhaps her future, that still haunted her nightmares. "No!" She screamed again, clutching her stomach, the pain and anger becoming overwhelming.

"不。" 明日香咳嗽着，嘴里尝到了血的味道，腹部传来一阵强烈而令人作呕的疼痛。这种疼痛对她来说太过熟悉，源自过去的一场战斗，或许也预示着未来，至今仍在她的噩梦中萦绕。"不！" 她再次尖叫，紧抓着肚子，痛苦和愤怒变得难以承受。

She attempted the get her Eva to push itself up but her arms suddenly felt too weak to support her. Cold was radiating out from her stomach and she was finding it hard to focus her mind.

她试图让她的 Eva 站起来，但双臂突然变得无力支撑。寒冷从她的腹部扩散开来，她发现自己难以集中精神。

"Kill you…" The Second Child snarled as she tried again to push up into standing. Each movement sapping more and more of her strength. She had to kill this Angel. If she didn't it would take Shinji… her Shinji. The stupid boy who had cost her so much worry and toil for so long. The boy who she had nearly killed herself twenty times over to keep alive in the frozen wilderness. The boy that she… that she…

"杀了你……" 第二适格者咆哮着，再次试图站起来。每一次动作都消耗着她越来越多的力量。她必须杀死这个使徒。如果她不这么做，它就会夺走真嗣……她的真嗣。那个让她长时间以来忧心忡忡、辛勤劳作的愚蠢男孩。那个在冰天雪地中，她为了让他活下来，几乎牺牲了自己二十次的男孩。那个她……她……

Evangelion Unit 02 crashed again to the ground as the 14th Angel cruised past, paying no more heed to its former enemy than if it were just another part of the blasted landscape of the Geofront. Only the bloodied stump of the Eva's right hand moved, as if still trying to stop the Angel through sheer force of will.

第 14 使徒掠过之际，初号机再次坠落地面，对其昔日之敌视若无睹，仿佛那只是地下都市废墟中的另一部分。唯有初号机血迹斑斑的右臂残肢在动，仿佛仍试图凭借意志力阻止使徒。

Asuka sat curled into a ball in the entry-plug. Her hands clenched over her stomach and tears streaming and dissolving into the LCL around her as she fought the growing coldness. "Shut down Unit 02, Eject the plug! Do it now!" She heard Misato yelling over the coms.

明日香蜷缩成一团坐在插入栓内，双手紧握着腹部，泪水不断流淌，融入周围的 LCL 中，她与逐渐袭来的寒意抗争着。"关闭二号机，弹出插入栓！马上执行！"她听到美里通过通讯器大声命令。

"No." She said more weakly, her vision becoming dark as the coldness took over her body. "Shinji…"

"不。" 她声音更微弱了，视线逐渐暗淡，寒意侵占了她的身体。"真嗣……"

Loud and insistent banging brought her back to herself.

一阵响亮而持续的敲击声将她拉回了现实。

The interior of the plug was pitch black. Asuka couldn't even tell if her eyes were open or closed. Her body ached abominably and her abdomen felt as if it had been sliced, mashed and beaten.

插头内部漆黑一片，明日香甚至分不清自己的眼睛是睁着还是闭着。她的身体疼痛难忍，腹部感觉像是被切开、捣碎又捶打过。

"Ahhh.." She winced as she tried to push herself up into sitting. "H-Hello?" She called weakly in reply to the banging from the outside. Voices could be heard calling out and the banging increased in intensity. After several seconds there was an angry squealing of metal as the emergency hatch of her plug finally opened and a pale light flooded the interior.

"啊……" 她试图撑起身子坐起来时，不禁皱了皱眉。"你、你好？" 她虚弱地回应着外面的敲击声。呼喊声此起彼伏，敲击声也愈发强烈。几秒钟后，随着紧急舱门的金属发出刺耳的摩擦声，终于打开了，一束苍白的光线涌入舱内。

The Helmeted head and shoulders of one of NERV's Emergency Recovery Response Unit team appeared though the hatch.

NERV 紧急恢复响应小组中的一员，戴着头盔的头和肩膀从舱口出现。

"Miss Soryu?" 早乙女小姐？

Asuka just nodded and the woman disappeared. Within a few minutes more people swarmed into her plug and she was strapped into a specially designed stretcher and hauled out into the rank and humid air of the Geofront.

明日香只是点了点头，那位女士便消失了。几分钟后，更多人涌入她的插入栓，她被固定在特制的担架上，抬到了第三新东京市地底那潮湿闷热的空气中。

Heavy fog and smoke still hung in the air and the floor of the underground fortress looked like a vision from a nightmare. The Command pyramid was spattered with red and showed signs of heavy damage. Several teams were still working to put out the fires that still blazed around the perimeter of the dome. The whole Geofront reeked of scorched earth and raw flesh.

浓雾与烟尘依旧弥漫在空中，地下要塞的地板宛如噩梦中的景象。指挥塔上溅满了红色，显示出严重受损的痕迹。几支队伍仍在努力扑灭环绕穹顶周边的火焰。整个地下都市弥漫着焦土与生肉的气味。

Asuka stared in confusion at the blood and gore that littered the ground as far as she could make out. She tried to sit up on the stretcher to see more clearly , but was held back down by one of the paramedics.

明日香困惑地凝视着满地的血迹和残骸，尽可能地辨认着。她试图在担架上坐起来以便看得更清楚，却被一名急救人员按住，阻止了她起身。

Then she saw it. 接着，她看到了。

Across the other side of the enormous dome, past where a similar team swarmed around the upended form of Unit 00, crouched in the fog was the unmistakeable silhouette of Evangelion Unit 01.

在巨大圆顶的另一侧，越过一群类似人员围绕着翻倒的零号机忙碌的地方，在雾中蹲伏着的是无法错认的初号机轮廓。

"No!" She screamed, causing intense pain to course through her viscera. "Shinji… Noooo!"

不！" 她尖叫着，剧烈的痛苦在她的内脏中蔓延。"真嗣… 不——！

"Calm down, Miss." The man carrying the back of her stretcher said. "You've lost a lot of…"

"冷静点，小姐。" 抬着她担架后部的那位男子说道，"你已经流失了很多……"

"H-He can't have…" Asuka cried, the horror weighing heavily on her. "I-I was supposed to save him!"

他不可能……" 明日香哭喊着，恐惧沉重地压在心头。"我……我本应该救他的！

"Miss Soryu…" 惣流小姐……

"I've fucked everything up." Asuka tried to put her hands up to her face, but they were strapped down firmly by her sides. "I've fucked it all up again!" She wailed, hot tears beginning to roll down her cheeks as she saw the collapse of her world beginning around her "Nononononono…" She moaned over and over again, feeling the hot swell of hysteria beginning to engulf her battered body as she began to struggle futilely against the restraints.

"我把一切都搞砸了。" 明日香试图举起双手捂住脸，但它们被牢牢地绑在身体两侧。"我又一次把所有事情都搞砸了！" 她哀嚎着，滚烫的泪水开始顺着她的脸颊流下，眼看着她的世界开始崩塌，"不不不不不……" 她一遍又一遍地呻吟，感到狂热的歇斯底里开始吞噬她那饱受摧残的身体，她开始徒劳地挣扎着对抗束缚。

The stretcher bearer behind her nodded to the medic walking alongside and suddenly Asuka felt a small sting in her left arm. "Wha… What was…?" She slurred as her vision started to blur. She fought vainly against the growing stupor, her last sight before unconsciousness took hold of her struggling mind was the dead vacant eyes of Unit 01 mocking her from across a sea of gore.

跟在她身后的担架员向旁边的医疗兵点了点头，突然间，明日香感到左臂一阵刺痛。"什…什么…？"她口齿不清地说，视线开始模糊。她徒劳地抵抗着逐渐袭来的昏沉，在意识被夺走前的最后一刻，她看到的是初号机那双死寂空洞的眼睛，在一片血海中嘲笑着她。

The red shore seemed more desolate than she remembered. Asuka collapsed down onto the ground, feeling the rough sand against her bare skin as she curled herself up into a ball.

红岸似乎比她记忆中更加荒凉。明日香瘫坐在地上，蜷缩成一团，感受着粗糙的沙粒摩擦着她裸露的肌肤。

How long she lay there and sobbed she wasn't sure. She felt rather than heard the presence of the other standing over her, but she simply ignored it. She didn't need its holier-then-thou disapprobation to know that she had failed. Even after all she had done to try prevent it Shinji had sortied against the 14th Angel. If she couldn't even prevent him from being absorbed by Unit 01 then everything she had done, all of her plans and effort had truly been for nothing.

她躺在那里哭了多久，她自己也不确定。她感觉到而非听到有人站在她上方，但她选择无视。她不需要那种自以为是的责备来告诉她自己已经失败了。尽管她竭尽全力试图阻止，真嗣还是出击对抗了第 14 使徒。如果她连阻止他被初号机吸收都做不到，那么她所做的一切，所有的计划和努力，真的就毫无意义了。

Maybe this was the end. Perhaps Lilith had finally brought her back to this place to rot and die for her failure? In some small way she welcomed the chance to fade away alone and unregarded. Spared the judgement of others. She was tired. Mortally and spiritually exhausted.

或许这就是终结。也许莉莉丝终于将她带回此地，任其因失败而腐朽消亡？在某种微小的程度上，她欣然接受独自消逝、无人问津的机会。免受他人评判。她已疲惫不堪，身心俱疲。

The presence standing over her made no move of sound. It simply waited as she sobbed quietly into her arms. Finally Asuka's tears dried up. After several more minutes she lifted her head and look up at the figure of Lilith, in the form of Ayanami Rei, that stood above her. Its crimson eyes regarded her with something akin to pity.

站在她面前的存在既未移动也未出声，只是静静等待，任由她将脸埋在臂弯中轻声啜泣。最终，明日香的泪水止住了。又过了几分钟，她抬起头，仰望站在她上方的莉莉丝，其形态是绫波丽。那双深红色的眼睛带着几分怜悯注视着她。

"Don't say it…" Asuka said in a harsh croak. "I've failed. I already know it"

"别说出来……"明日香嘶哑着声音说道，"我失败了，我自己心里清楚。"

Lilith regarded her for several seconds. "It seems that I have misjudged you, Soryu."

莉莉丝凝视了她几秒钟，说道：“看来我误解你了，索龙。”

Asuka sighed deeply before pushing herself up into sitting. She stared out across the red sea. "So that's it then? You're going to leave me here to rot, all alone, aren't you? Seems strangely fitting I guess."

明日香深深叹了口气，然后坐起身来。她凝视着那片红色的海洋。“那么，就这样了吗？你要把我留在这里腐烂，孤零零的，对吧？我想这倒也挺合适的。”

"You misunderstand me." Lilith replied. Her tone causing the redhead to turn her head up to face her ethereal nemesis. "Your ability to effect change in the pre-Impact world was greater than I had imagined."

你误解我了。" 莉莉丝回答道。她的语气让红发女子抬起头来，面对她那超凡脱俗的对手。"你在冲击前世界中改变事物的能力，比我预想的要大得多。

"So… Wait… what?" 那么……等等……什么？

"I admit that we held little hope that you alone would be able to achieve more than to die heroically against either the Angels or the machinations of the Human Instrumentality Project." Lilith continued. "Thereby leading others to expose SEELE or inspiring Shinji to greater efforts and thereby prevent the atrocity of Third Impact. The path you have taken is both surprising, and yet typical of your more… emotional nature."

我承认，我们原本对你独自一人能取得的成就并不抱太大希望，至多是在对抗天使或人类补完计划的阴谋中英勇牺牲。然而，你却引领他人揭露 SEELE，或激励真嗣付出更大努力，从而阻止了第三次冲击的暴行。你所选择的道路既令人惊讶，又符合你那更为……感性的本性。

"I don't get it." Asuka answered with a sniff. Her annoyance building at the feeling of being used in such an underhanded and callous way.

"我不明白。" 明日香回答时带着一声轻哼，她感到自己被如此卑鄙和无情地利用，心中的恼怒逐渐积聚。

"As I said, I… we have misjudged you." Lilith said reaching out her hand to Asuka. The German girl grabbed the offered hand and pulled herself up into standing. The blue haired being stared into her eyes and gave a small smile. Despite herself the redhead was speechless at the peace and beauty that smile radiated. "You may continue as before. I think that this will be the last time that we meet before the end, Asuka."

正如我所说，我……我们误判了你。”莉莉丝说着，伸出手去拉明日香。德国女孩抓住伸来的手，站了起来。蓝发女子凝视着她的眼睛，露出一丝微笑。尽管自己不愿承认，但红发少女被那微笑中散发出的平和与美丽震撼得说不出话来。“你可以继续像以前一样。我想这将是我们在结束前最后一次见面，明日香。”

The use of her first name caused Asuka's eyes to widen. "I-I still don't understand what the hell is going on here!"

听到对方直呼其名，明日香瞪大了眼睛。“我-我还是搞不懂这里到底发生了什么鬼事情！”

"Farewell, Second Child." Was the only reply she got. The shoreline slowly faded to black and a feeling of peace and healing enveloped the weary teen as she let herself drift into the darkness.

"再见了，第二个孩子。"这是她得到的唯一回应。海岸线缓缓融入黑暗，疲惫的少女被一种平静与治愈的感觉包围，她让自己漂入黑暗之中。

beep… beep… beep… beep… 哔…哔…哔…哔…

The steady rhythm of the electronic monitor was her only connection to the world outside for an indeterminate period of time. When it finally ceased she almost felt a sense of loss, as if she was even more alone now with its absence.

电子监护仪稳定的节奏是她与外界唯一的联系，持续了不知多久。当它最终停止时，她几乎感到一种失落，仿佛在它的缺失下，她更加孤独了。

She became vaguely aware of voices around her, their meaning and purpose beyond the grasp of her foggy mind. Firmly but gently she felt hands grab her and lift her onto another bed followed by the sensation of movement mixed with the echoes and sounds of a long corridor. Finally the movement ceased and all was quiet once more. Asuka let herself fall back into the silence.

她隐约意识到周围有声音，其意义和目的超出了她模糊思维的把握。她感觉到有力的手温柔地抓住她，将她抬到另一张床上，随后是混合着长廊回声和声音的移动感。最终，移动停止了，一切再次归于寂静。明日香让自己沉浸在这片宁静之中。

When she came back to some form of awareness the room seemed brighter, at least as far as her groggy brain could determine from behind her closed eyelids. Her left hand was weighed down by something warm and soft. She clutched at it like a lifeline and felt its grip also tighten. Struggling towards consciousness her head tossed from side to side and she let out a weak groan in frustration. Quickly her distress was soothed by a warm hand stroking her hair and a familiar voice speaking softly to her. Once again she felt her body relaxing at the touch as the warmth and darkness, somehow a little less lonely now, retook her into its embrace.

当她恢复些许意识时，房间似乎更亮了，至少在她昏沉的大脑从紧闭的眼皮后所能判断的范围内。她的左手被某种温暖柔软的东西压着。她紧抓着它，仿佛抓住了救命稻草，并感觉到对方的握力也收紧了。她挣扎着向清醒靠近，头左右摇摆，发出一声无力的呻吟以示沮丧。很快，一只温暖的手抚摸着她的头发，一个熟悉的声音温柔地对她说话，她的焦虑得到了安抚。她再次感受到身体在触碰下放松，温暖和黑暗重新将她拥入怀中，此刻似乎不再那么孤单。

Like a deep-sea diver finally breaking the surface Asuka felt full awareness wash over her. The rattle of air-conditioning and the sounds of a busy hospital were all around her now. She could feel the steady rise and fall of her chest against the starched sheet that all too tightly held her against the mattress of the bed that she lay in. Her left hand was above the covers, though it still felt the warmth and weight of contact with another.

就像深海潜水者终于浮出水面，明日香感到全然的意识涌上心头。空调的嗡鸣声和繁忙医院的各种声响环绕四周。她能感觉到自己的胸膛在僵硬的床单下，被紧紧束缚在床垫上，有规律地起伏。她的左手露在被子外，却仍能感受到与另一物接触的温暖与重量。

Slowly prising her eyes open the brightness of the room assaulted her mind like a physical force.

她缓缓睁开双眼，房间的亮度如同一股实体力量般冲击着她的意识。

"Unnngh…" She moaned closing her eyes again. Instead she lay there and listened for a few moments. Beneath all the usual hospital sounds there was a heavy, regular breathing. She focused in on that sound. She knew that rhythm intimately; it had guarded and comforted her nights for so long it felt like a part of her. Once again she, gingerly, opened her eyes. The stark white of the hospital ceiling, with sickly green walls either side burnt into her retinas. She lay there blinking rapidly for a good minute or so until her eyelids stopped rasping and her eyes stopped stinging.

"嗯……" 她呻吟着再次闭上眼睛。相反，她躺在那里，静静地听了一会儿。在所有医院常见的声音之下，有一种沉重而有规律的呼吸声。她集中注意力于那个声音。她对那个节奏非常熟悉；它守护并安慰了她无数个夜晚，仿佛已成为她的一部分。她再次小心翼翼地睁开眼睛。医院天花板的刺眼白色，以及两侧病态的绿色墙壁，深深烙印在她的视网膜上。她躺在那里，快速眨眼大约一分钟，直到眼皮不再摩擦，眼睛不再刺痛。

After a couple of deep breaths she looked to her down to her hand. She actually couldn't see much of it as it was covered by another hand. She knew that hand. Almost not daring to hope Asuka turned and looked to her left. Her heart swelled with joy when she laid eyes on the somnolent form of Shinji Ikari. His head lolled on the hospital armchair that he must have pulled to her beside while she was asleep. His hair was unkempt, his clothes wrinkled and a small trail of drool trailed from his lower lip.

深呼吸几下后，她低头看向自己的手。实际上，她看不太清楚，因为手被另一只手覆盖着。她认得那只手。几乎不敢抱有希望，明日香转头向左看去。当她看到沉睡中的碇真嗣时，她的心充满了喜悦。他的头靠在医院扶手椅上，这把椅子一定是他在她睡着时拉到她旁边的。他的头发凌乱，衣服皱巴巴的，还有一小条口水从他的下唇流下。

Asuka thought that she had never seen him look so handsome. She could see that between them was a small table with what appeared to be the remains of a meal left on it. Bracing herself she pushed her body up into sitting. Surprisingly her body felt good. She prodded her abdomen for any signs of damage or tenderness, but there was none there to feel.

明日香觉得她从未见过他如此英俊。她看到他们之间有一张小桌子，上面似乎还留着残羹剩饭。她鼓起勇气，坐起身来。出乎意料的是，她的身体感觉很好。她轻触腹部，寻找任何损伤或疼痛的迹象，但那里什么也没有。

"Ikuhayo, Asuka." She said, or at least tried to say. The raspy croak that came out startled her. Looking over at Shinji's partially eaten meal she quickly spied some orange juice. Reaching out her arm she picked up that plastic cup. She couldn't believe how thirsty she was! Her mouth felt like the bottom of a parrot's cage, or at least how she imagined one would be. Greedily she slurped the cup dry. It tasted so good to her.

"去吧，明日香。" 她试图这么说，但发出的沙哑声音却让她自己都吓了一跳。她转头看向真嗣那盘吃了一半的饭菜，迅速发现了橙汁。她伸出手臂，拿起那杯塑料杯。她简直不敢相信自己有多渴！她的嘴感觉就像鹦鹉笼底，至少她想象中的那样。她贪婪地一口气喝干了橙汁，那味道对她来说太美妙了。

Shinji murmured and stirred in his sleep, but didn't wake. Feeling her strength returning more and more Asuka pushed further up the bed and reached for the plastic spork that lay unused by the plate. Grinning evilly she gently unwrapped it and held it point down in her right hand. After a moment's hesitation, as if wrestling with her conscience, she gripped the implement firmly and jabbed it down into Shinji's hand.

真嗣在睡梦中喃喃自语，翻了个身，却没有醒来。随着体力逐渐恢复，明日香更用力地撑起身子，伸手去够盘子旁那把未曾使用的塑料勺子。她邪恶地笑了笑，轻轻拆开包装，右手握着勺尖朝下。犹豫了片刻，仿佛在与自己的良心斗争，她紧紧握住勺子，猛地向真嗣的手扎去。

"Waaaaaaagh!" The Third Child screamed only seconds later.

"哇啊啊啊啊啊！" 第三适格者几秒钟后尖叫起来。

"Oh good, you're awake!" Asuka said cheerily.

"哦，太好了，你醒了！" 明日香高兴地说。

"A-Asuka!" Shinji stammered, clutching his stinging hand. After rubbing the red mark on it for a few seconds he collected himself and looked up at her, his eyes staring into hers searchingly as moisture began to collect in them. "Y-You're… I mean… It's good to see…" Lost for words he stumbled into silence.

"明…明日香！" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，紧握着刺痛的手。他揉了几秒钟手上的红印，然后镇定下来，抬头看着她，目光探寻地凝视着她的眼睛，泪水开始在眼眶中聚集。"你…我是说…见到你真好…" 他语无伦次，陷入了沉默。

"Hi Shinji." The redhead answered him with a gentler smile. "Oof" was the next sound to escape her lips as she was drawn into a tight bear-hug by a suddenly sobbing Third Child.

"嗨，真嗣。" 红发女孩带着更温柔的微笑回应他。紧接着，她被突然哭泣的第三适格者紧紧抱住，不由自主地发出了一声“呃”。

"IwassoscaredthatyouwerenevergoingtowakeupeventhoughMisatosaid…."

我好害怕你永远不会醒来，尽管小光说……

"Shinji!" Asuka gasped, the wind having been knocked out of her. "Calm down… I'm alright! Or at least I was until you decided to crash-tackle me in my hospital bed!"

"真嗣！"明日香喘着气说，风似乎被撞出了她的身体。"冷静点…我没事！至少在你决定在医院床上对我进行冲撞之前是这样！"

"Huh?" Shinji said before suddenly leaping away from her. "Sorry! Oh god, I'm so sorry Asuka! I-I didn't hurt you did I? I'm so sorr…"

"嗯？" 真嗣说着，突然从她身边跳开。"对不起！哦天啊，真对不起，明日香！我...我没有伤到你吧？真的很抱歉…"

"Ach! Please stop apologising!" Asuka said with mock ire. "I'm fine! I'm not sure how or why, but I feel fine!"

"啊！请别再道歉了！"明日香佯装生气地说，"我没事！虽然不知道怎么回事，也不知道为什么，但我感觉很好！"

"I'm glad!" Shinji replied with a sniff. "I was so worried about you! You've been asleep for over a week!"

我很高兴！" 真嗣回答道，吸了吸鼻子。"我真担心你！你已经睡了一个多星期了！

"A week!" Asuka exclaimed, her voice still hoarse. "You mean I've been lying here for a week?"

"一个星期！" 明日香惊呼道，她的声音依旧沙哑。"你的意思是我已经躺在这里一个星期了？"

"Well, for the first four days you were in the ICU." Shinji replied. "Doctor Akagi wouldn't let me come see you. After that they brought you here and kept you sedated while the drugs were flushed out of your system. I've been here ever since then."

“嗯，前四天你一直在重症监护室。” 真嗣回答道，“赤木医生不让我来看你。之后他们把你转到这里，并在清除你体内药物的同时让你保持镇静。从那以后我就一直在这里。”

"So I've been here all alone and unconscious with you this whole time?" Asuka asked in a teasing tone. "You didn't try anything weird with my prone and defenceless body did you, Shinji?"

"所以这段时间我一直独自在这里，毫无意识地和你在一起？" 明日香带着戏谑的语气问道，"你没有趁我毫无防备的时候对我做什么奇怪的事吧，真嗣？"

Shinji looked at her with a confused expression. "Weird?" He asked. "What do you mean… Oh…" He suddenly trailed off, his face growing red. "O-Of course not! I would never do…"

真嗣带着困惑的表情看着她。“奇怪？”他问道，“你什么意思……哦……”他突然停了下来，脸颊泛起红晕。“当、当然不是！我绝不会做……”

The redhead held up her hand . "I was kidding.. Jeez! As if you would do anything like that to me! Well, while I was unconscious anyway!" She reached over and gripped his hand tightly, drawing him closer to her and looking deeply into his eyes, her mouth upturned in a predatory smile. "Of course, seeing that I'm awake now… Well that's a different proposition altogether!"

红发女子举起手说：“我开玩笑的..天哪！好像你会对我做那种事似的！好吧，至少在我昏迷的时候不会！”她伸手紧紧抓住他的手，将他拉近，深邃地凝视着他的眼睛，嘴角勾起一抹狩猎般的微笑。“当然，既然我现在醒了……那可就是完全不同的提议了！”

She had to laugh at the open-mouthed look that Shinji gave her. She quickly pulled him in close to her and kissed him deeply. She couldn't hide how happy she was that he was there, next to her, not trapped inside Unit 01 like she had feared at the end of the battle. This, though, led her to some very important questions.

她忍不住对真嗣那张目瞪口呆的表情笑了出来。她迅速将他拉近，深情地吻了他。她无法掩饰自己因为他就在身边，而不是像战斗结束时她担心的那样被困在初号机里，而感到的无比幸福。然而，这也让她不得不面对一些非常重要的问题。

"So, Shinji." Asuka said after finally breaking their lip-lock. "What the hell happened out there with the Angel? Last thing I can remember is things weren't looking so great for our side."

那么，真嗣。" 明日香终于结束了他们的亲吻，说道，"外面和使徒到底发生了什么？我记得的最后一件事是我们这边情况不太妙。

"Well," Shinji began. "After you…after you were…"

"嗯，" 真嗣开始说道，"在你……在你离开之后……"

"After I got my ass handed to me by the Angel is what you're trying to say, I think."

你是想说，我被使徒打得落花流水之后的事吧。

"No! It's just that…" He trailed off after the German girl fixed him with a meaningful look. "Well, after that… and Rei was unconscious too. Ummm… the Angel, well it breached the fourth defensive barrier and Father released Unit 01 to fight." He swallowed briefly and looked to his orange juice, but noticed that it was empty. "I-I drove it back up into the Geofront, and I-I guess that I beat it." Shinji finished simply.

"不！只是……" 被德国女孩意味深长地看了一眼后，他话音渐弱。"嗯，在那之后……还有，丽也昏迷了。呃……那个使徒，它突破了第四道防御屏障，父亲就释放了初号机去战斗。" 他短暂地咽了咽口水，看向自己的橙汁，却发现已经空了。"我……我把它赶回了地下都市，我想……我应该是打败它了。" 真嗣简单地结束了叙述。

"Hmmm…" Asuka said. "Don't take this the wrong way, Shinji-kun… You suck at story-telling!"

"嗯……" 明日香说道，"别误会，真嗣君……你讲故事真的很糟糕！"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"I do remember one thing." Asuka answered, "After I was taken out of the entry-plug, I-I saw Unit 01. It was covered with blood! There… there was blood everywhere! What the hell happened?"

"我确实记得一件事。" 明日香回答道，"在我被从插入栓中取出后，我看到了零号机。它浑身是血！那里……到处都是血！到底发生了什么？"

"I-I guess that I went a little crazy when I saw how badly damaged Unit 02 was." Shinji said almost sheepishly. "I think that maybe I got a little c-carried away."

我-我想我看到 02 号机损坏得那么严重时，确实有点失控了。" 真嗣有些不好意思地说，"可能我有点过于激动了。

Asuka flopped back on the hospital bed, suddenly very tired. "Baka." She said softly, there was no malice or anger in her tone, only affection. "You need to take more care of yourself. I don't want you rampaging around trying to be the big damn hero and putting yourself in danger, Shinji. You understand me? You're too important to me to take risks like that! What if you hadn't come back?"

明日香突然疲惫地倒在病床上，轻声说道："笨蛋。" 她的语气中没有恶意或愤怒，只有柔情。"你要多照顾自己。我不想你四处逞英雄，把自己置于危险之中，真嗣。你明白我的意思吗？你对我来说太重要了，不能冒那样的风险！万一你回不来怎么办？"

The Third Child's face was a study in unfettered joy as he smiled down at her. "Then maybe you understand why I went crazy like I did." He said warmly. "You're th-the most important thing in the world to me, Asuka. If you had been… If you'd gone… I don't know what I would have done!"

第三子的脸上洋溢着无拘无束的喜悦，他微笑着俯视着她。“那么，或许你能理解我为何会那样疯狂。”他温暖地说道，“你对我来说，是世界上最重要的人，明日香。如果你……如果你离开了……我真不知道自己会做出什么来！”

"Baka-Shinji." Asuka said with a huge yawn. "I'll always be here, don't you ever forget that!"

"笨蛋真嗣。" 明日香打着大大的哈欠说道，"我会一直在这里，你可千万别忘了！"

Shinji smiled, his eyes welling up again. "Sure, Asuka. I won't forget."

真嗣微笑着，眼眶再次湿润。“当然，明日香。我不会忘记的。”

The only reply was a light snore as the exhausted redhead gave in the desire to sleep once more. The Third Child smiled down at her and stroked her hair lightly. Even he could feel the change that had taken place inside of him recently. Asuka had changed too. It wasn't only Shinji that saw it. He still lived with the fear that it would all vanish in an instant. That his happiness would suddenly be ripped from his grasp and there would be nothing that he could do to stop it. But, for once, he felt comfortable enough to enjoy the moment for what it was.

唯一的回应是一阵轻微的鼾声，疲惫的红发少女再次屈服于睡意。第三适格者微笑着俯视她，轻抚她的头发。就连他自己也能感受到最近内心发生的变化。明日香也变了。不只是真嗣注意到了这一点。他仍然生活在恐惧中，担心这一切会在瞬间消失。担心他的幸福会突然被夺走，而他却无能为力。但是，这一次，他感到足够安心，能够享受当下的时刻。

He settled back and made himself comfortable once more in the chair. Within minutes he too was sleeping soundly beside the girl he loved.

他再次靠回椅子上，让自己舒服起来。没过几分钟，他也沉沉地睡在了心爱的女孩旁边。

The car trip back to the apartment was a surprisingly calm affair. Sure, the speed limit was treated with the usual amount of disdain, but on the whole Misato kept the violent swerving and tyre-squealing to a sedate minimum. Their guardian seemed to be treating Asuka as if the German girl needed to be wrapped in cotton wool after her extended stay in the NERV infirmary. Asuka smiled to herself as she clutched Shinji's hand tighter. If she didn't know better she'd almost suspect that Misato had been worried about her for the week or so that the redhead had been unconscious.

返回公寓的汽车之旅出乎意料地平静。当然，限速被一如既往地轻视，但总体上，葛城美里将剧烈的摇摆和轮胎的尖叫声控制在了一个温和的最低限度。他们的监护人似乎把明日香当作了需要呵护的宝贝，毕竟德国女孩在 NERV 医务室里待了那么久。明日香紧握着真嗣的手，暗自微笑。如果她不了解情况，几乎会怀疑葛城美里在她昏迷的那一周左右时间里，真的为她担心过。

She broke her gaze from the darkened streetscape of Tokyo-03 that was flashing past the window and looked over at Shinji. The brown haired teen gave her a shy smile and squeezed her hand back. She really was surprised at how good she felt. She guessed that being at the pointy end of the frontiers of biological, military and medical science wasn't such a bad thing all things considered. Doctor Akagi had been quite clear that Asuka had been on a knife edge of survivability after her battle with the 14th Angel. Her synchronisation with Unit 02 during the battle had meant that she was suffering considerable internal injuries and blood-loss by the time she had been placed in the 'Incubator' at NERV infirmary's ICU and pumped full of the latest in accelerated healing drugs.

她从窗外闪过的东京-03 暗淡街景中收回目光，转头看向真嗣。棕发少年羞涩地回以微笑，并紧握了她的手。她确实惊讶于自己感觉如此良好。她猜想，站在生物、军事和医学科学的前沿尖端，综合考虑，其实也并非坏事。赤木博士曾明确表示，在与第 14 使徒战斗后，明日香处于生死边缘。战斗中与二号机的同步使她遭受了严重的内伤和失血，直到被安置在 NERV 医务室 ICU 的“孵化器”中，并注入了最新的加速愈合药物。

Not that she could tell, eight days later. Apart from feeling a little weak from the lack of activity she felt fine. More than fine actually. Shinji was right there by her side, not trapped inside Unit-01 for another three weeks like he had been at this point last time. All three Eva Units were locked down for extensive repairs, but she knew that the next Angel attack was weeks away and even though thinking about the 15th Angel still brought her out in a cold sweat, she was determined not to worry about it until closer to that time.

并非她所能察觉，八天后。除了因缺乏活动而感到有些虚弱外，她感觉良好。实际上，比良好还要好。真嗣就在她身边，不像上次那样被困在初号机里长达三周。所有三台 EVA 机体都因需要进行大规模维修而被封存，但她知道下一次使徒袭击还有数周之遥，尽管想到第 15 使徒仍让她冒冷汗，她决心不到临近那时不再为此担忧。

Right then and there, things were good. During wartime all you ever had was the here and now. She was determined to enjoy it.

就在那时那刻，一切都很美好。战时你拥有的永远只有当下。她决心要享受这一切。

The Alpine A110 squealed into the parking bay and its three occupants quickly headed for the lifts. Misato was prattling on about 'Welcome Home' parties and a million other trivialities but the two pilots just held hands and said very little on the ride up to their apartment's level.

阿尔派 A110 尖叫着驶入停车位，三名乘客迅速朝电梯走去。美里一直在喋喋不休地谈论着“欢迎回家”派对和无数其他琐事，但两位飞行员只是手牵手，在乘电梯上到他们公寓楼层的过程中几乎一言不发。

Once inside the apartment Asuka found herself rapidly guided into one of the chairs at the kitchen table as her two flatmates bustled around her. Within quick succession she found a steaming mug of hot chocolate and a freshly made sandwich on a plate placed in front of her.

一进公寓，明日香就被迅速引到厨房餐桌的一把椅子上坐下，她的两位室友在她周围忙碌着。紧接着，她面前就摆上了一杯热气腾腾的热巧克力和一盘刚做好的三明治。

Finding her stomach suddenly growling with hunger the redhead set to her modest meal with gusto, demolishing the sandwich in record time before cradling the hot chocolate lovingly in her hands.

红发女子突然感到饥饿袭来，她的肚子开始咕咕作响。于是，她兴致勃勃地开始享用那顿简朴的餐食，以破纪录的速度消灭了三明治，随后双手温柔地捧着热巧克力。

It was good to be home.

回家真好。

Home… 家……

She smiled to herself. This little apartment was more of a home to her than anywhere she had ever been in her whole life. It was good to be there. It was a modest epiphany, but an epiphany nonetheless. She gave a small chuckle at the ridiculous track her thoughts were taking.

她独自微笑。这个小公寓对她来说，比她一生中待过的任何地方都更像家。在那里感觉真好。虽然只是一个小小的顿悟，但终究是顿悟。她对自己荒谬的思绪轻声笑了出来。

Misato, now dressed in her standard cut-offs and tank-top, sat down across from her at the table as Shinji pulled up a chair next to her.

真嗣在她对面坐下，而穿着标准短裤和背心的美里则坐在她对面。

"It's good to hear you laugh, Asuka." Misato said. "I know that you might think that I'm just your commanding officer, but you guys are much more than that to me! We're practically family!"

听到你笑真好，明日香。"美里说，"我知道你可能认为我只是你的指挥官，但你们对我来说远不止于此！我们几乎就是一家人！

"Family…" Asuka repeated, as if she were trying out the word to see how it felt coming out of her mouth. "I…I think that I'm okay with that."

"家庭……" 明日香重复道，仿佛在尝试这个词语，看看从她嘴里说出来是什么感觉。"我……我觉得我可以接受这个。"

"I'm glad to hear that." Misato answered. "Although I don't think any of us has much experience of what actually makes a family, but hey, that doesn't matter. We'll just make it up as we go, how about that?"

"很高兴听到这个。" 美里回答道，"虽然我们中没有人有多少关于家庭真正是什么的经验，但没关系，我们就边走边创造吧，怎么样？"

"I think I'd like that, Misato." Shinji said.

我想我会喜欢那个，真嗣说道。

Asuka thought about it for a while and then simply nodded, cradling her mug as if for protection.

明日香想了一会儿，然后只是点了点头，抱着她的杯子仿佛在寻求保护。

"Good." Their guardian continued. "It makes me glad to see you happy, both of you. And I think that I know why."

他们的监护人继续说道：“很好。看到你们俩都这么开心，我感到很高兴。而且我想我知道为什么。”

"What… what are you talking about Misato?" Asuka asked. There was something in the woman's tone that made Asuka suddenly uneasy. She looked over at Shinji and saw that he was beginning to blush.

"你在说什么啊，美里？"明日香问道。女人的语气中似乎有些什么，让明日香突然感到不安。她朝真嗣看去，发现他开始脸红了。

'Uh-oh.' Was all that she thought.

'哎呀。' 她心里只这么想。

"While… While you were in the infirmary, Shinji and I had a talk. Quite a long talk actually." Misato began. The redhead could see that Shinji's blush was growing deeper and suddenly the Third Child seemed to be unable to take his eyes off of the table top.

"在你去医务室的时候，我和真嗣聊了聊。其实聊了挺久的。" 美里开始说道。红发女子注意到真嗣的脸越来越红，突然间，这位第三适格者似乎无法将目光从桌面上移开。

"Th-that's nice." Asuka answered, her mouth strangely dry. "What was it that you talked about?"

那-那真不错。" 明日香回答道，她的嘴巴出奇地干涩。"你们聊了些什么呢？

"I think that you know what it was Asuka." Misato replied. "Please don't be angry at Shinji for telling me about what… what the two of you did the night before the battle. I can be pretty persuasive when I want to be. In some ways I knew that it was inevitable… Two teenagers in love under the same roof, sleeping in the same bed… I guess that even though I tried to pretend that it wouldn't happen in a way I'm glad that you've both found strength in each other. I-I guess that it makes me a terrible guardian, having you two sleeping together while under my care…"

我想你知道是什么，明日香。" 美里回应说。"请不要因为真嗣告诉我你们俩在战斗前一晚所做的事情而生他的气。当我想要说服别人时，我可以相当有说服力。在某种程度上，我知道这是不可避免的……两个相爱的少年在同一个屋檐下，睡在同一张床上……我想，尽管我试图假装这种情况不会发生，某种程度上我还是为你们俩在彼此身上找到了力量而感到高兴。我-我想这让我成了一个糟糕的监护人，让你们俩在我的照顾下睡在一起……

"You're not a terrible guardian, Misato!" Shinji interrupted.

"你并不是一个糟糕的监护人，美里！" 真嗣打断道。

"Maybe not," Misato continued. "But you know what? I don't give a fuck! If you two can be happy, even for a short time, what gives me the right to stop you. As if I could anyway! Shinji made that pretty clear during our conversation! I'm glad that he told me. Keeping something like this from each other, it can only poison everything. Secrets… all they do is hurt and damage people. I don't want that to happen to you, to Shinji, to any of us!"

"或许不是，" 美里继续说道，"但你知道吗？我他妈不在乎！如果你们俩能幸福，哪怕只是短暂的时光，我又有什么权利阻止你们。何况我也阻止不了！真嗣在我们谈话中已经表达得很清楚了！我很高兴他告诉了我。彼此隐瞒这样的事情，只会毒害一切。秘密……它们只会伤害和破坏人们。我不希望这种事发生在你们身上，发生在真嗣身上，发生在我们的任何一个人身上！"

Both of them stared at the redheaded girl. Asuka sat there

两人都盯着那个红发女孩。明日香坐在那里。

"I-I'm sorry, Asuka." Shinji said. "Please don't be angry at me! I was j-just so scared I was going to lose you! I couldn't keep it… I didn't want any more secrets between us! Secrets and lies... those are what Father uses" He said plaintively. "I don't want to be like him."

"我、我很抱歉，明日香。" 真嗣说道，"请不要生我的气！我只是太害怕会失去你！我无法再保持沉默……我不想我们之间再有任何秘密！秘密和谎言……那正是父亲所用的手段。" 他哀怨地说，"我不想变得像他那样。"

A heavy silence filled the kitchen.

厨房里弥漫着沉重的寂静。

"Hmmm… Secrets…" Asuka said pensively.

"嗯……秘密……" 明日香若有所思地说。

The other two looked at her. Shinji's expression was puzzled and more than a little worried. Misato, on the other hand, had a far more appraising look on her face.

另外两人看着她。真嗣的表情显得困惑且颇为担忧。而美里则是一副更加审视的神情。

A long and awkward silence filled the apartment. Asuka just looked at her hands as they lay on the table, while her flatmates watched her with worry in their eyes.

公寓里弥漫着长时间的尴尬沉默。明日香只是看着自己放在桌上的双手，而她的室友们则忧心忡忡地注视着她。

"You've been hiding something else from us, both of us, haven't you Kiddo?" The Major said gently. "Something's got you terrified. Something that's been weighing you down for at least a couple of months now."

你还有别的事情瞒着我们，瞒着我们俩，对吧，孩子？"少校温和地说，"有什么东西让你感到极度恐惧。至少这几个月来，它一直在压垮你。

Asuka's eyes were glued to her hands as her fingers wrung around each other. She could feel her stomach turning in knots.

明日香的目光紧紧盯着她绞在一起的手指，她能感觉到自己的胃在打结。

"Asuka… You can tell us." Misato said. "You know that we won't judge you. If… If it's about your past… if it helps I already know a lot of it. You've done nothing wrong, you know that."

“明日香……你可以告诉我们。” 美里说，“你知道我们不会评判你。如果……如果是关于你的过去……如果这有帮助的话，我已经知道很多了。你没有做错任何事，你知道的。”

"It's not that." Asuka said with a croak. "I… I just can't… You wouldn't believe me."

“不是那样的。”明日香嗓音沙哑地说，“我……我只是不能……你不会相信我的。”

"Why not?" Shinji said. "Why wouldn't we believe you?"

"为什么不呢？" 真嗣说道，"我们有什么理由不相信你呢？"

"Y-You don't know where I've come from… What I've been through to get here. I'm scared that if I told you… you'd think I was insane or something!"

你不知道我从哪里来…经历了什么才来到这里。我害怕如果我告诉你…你会觉得我疯了或者什么的！

"We've all come from some pretty fucked-up places, Asuka." Misato answered. "If anybody's going to believe you, understand you, it's the two of us!"

我们都来自一些相当糟糕的地方，明日香。" 美里回答道，"如果有人会相信你，理解你，那就是我们俩了！

The Second Child sat perfectly still in her seat for nearly two minutes. Eventually she stood up, her chair scraping in the linoleum loudly. She looked her two flatmates in the eyes, each in turn, her own eyes red and brimming with moisture.

二女儿在座位上纹丝不动地坐了近两分钟。最终她站起身来，椅子在油毡上发出刺耳的摩擦声。她依次凝视着两位室友的眼睛，自己的双眼红肿，泪水盈眶。

"Wait here." She said. "I'm gonna take a shower."

"在这儿等着。" 她说，"我要去洗个澡。"

Abruptly she turned and walked to the apartment's tiny bathroom. Within a short time the hiss of falling water could be heard as Asuka Langley Soryu took a long and very hot shower. Misato and Shinji sat where they were. The older woman reached over and clutched at Shinji's hand firmly, reassuringly. The teen smiled, though his eyes remained worried. There they sat for nearly twenty minutes before the water was finally turned off. Eventually the bathroom door opened and from the cloud of steam that billowed from it the figure of the Second Child emerged. Glowing from the heat and wearing her red bath-robe.

她突然转身走向公寓狭小的浴室。不久，便能听到水流倾泻的嘶嘶声，明日香·兰格雷在浴室里享受着漫长而滚烫的淋浴。美里和真嗣坐在原位未动。年长的女子伸手紧紧握住真嗣的手，给予他安慰。少年虽露出微笑，眼中却难掩忧虑。他们就这样坐了近二十分钟，直到水声终于停止。最终，浴室门打开，一股蒸汽涌出，第二适格者的身影从中显现，因热气而泛红，身着红色浴袍。

Purposefully she strode into the kitchen and looked down at her two flatmates. She raised an eyebrow when she saw their hands still clasped but made no mention on it. A broad, but nervous smile formed on her lips.

她故意大步走进厨房，低头看着她的两个室友。当她看到他们的手仍然紧握时，她扬起了一边的眉毛，但没有提及此事。她的唇边浮现出一个宽阔却略带紧张的微笑。

"Not here." She said.

"不在这儿。" 她说。

"Huh?" Shinji replied. Misato just waited for her to elaborate.

"什么？" 真嗣回答道。 美里只是等着她继续说下去。

"Tomorrow." Asuka said. "明天。" 明日香说。

"Tomorrow?" Misato and Shinji asked at the same time.

"明天？" 明日香和真嗣同时问道。

"Tomorrow we're going out." The redhead continued. "I'm sick and tired of doing this alone. Tomorrow… I'm gonna tell you something that will blow your tiny minds!"

“明天我们要出去。”红发人继续说道，“我厌倦了独自做这件事。明天……我要告诉你们一些事情，会让你们的小脑袋大吃一惊！”

## Chapter 15: Sole Survivor

第 15 章：唯一的幸存者

Unbroken 坚不可摧

Maybe tomorrow, when the sun comes out and melts my flesh away,

Maybe tomorrow, when the toxic clouds just take our breath away

And it'll be alright when the dark sets in and the screams all fade away,

Maybe tomorrow; there'll be no one to save…

或许明天，当太阳升起，将我的肉体融化，或许明天，当毒云夺走我们的呼吸，当黑暗降临，尖叫声消逝，一切都会好起来，或许明天；将无人可救…

Maybe Tomorrow, Chance Waters 2012

也许明天，Chance Waters 2012

Among many other issues, what has made this chapter particularly difficult to write is its expositional nature. It is Asuka's big reveal, after all. Do I have her spell it all out in thousands upon thousands of words of dry-ish dialogue? I mean, it does essentially encompass much of the original plot of Evangelion, plus the altered aspects of this particular time-line in comparison to the original series! Even thinking about writing that still gives me an anxiety attack!

在众多问题中，这一章节特别难写的原因在于其阐述性质。毕竟，这是明日香的重要揭露。我是否应该让她用成千上万字的干巴巴对话来一一说明呢？我的意思是，这基本上涵盖了《新世纪福音战士》的原始剧情，以及与原系列相比，这一特定时间线的改动部分！即便只是想到要写这个，仍然让我感到焦虑！

Chapter 15: 第 15 章：

Sole Survivor 唯一的幸存者

"Wh… what does that even mean?" Misato finally broke the silence.

"什…什么意思啊？" 终于，Misato 打破了沉默。

Apart from the three of them, the world seemed empty and silent. Not even birds sang in the pre-dawn stillness.

除了他们三人，世界似乎空旷而寂静。就连鸟儿也没有在黎明前的静谧中歌唱。

"F-Forget it… I… I was just joking…"

算了吧…我…我只是在开玩笑…

"Oh no… you don't get to fob us off with this, Asuka." The Major shot back. "You're going to tell me and Shinji your "big secret", even if we have to sit up here on this hill all god-damn day!"

哦不…你别想用这个打发我们，明日香。"少校反驳道，"你得告诉我们你那个'大秘密'，哪怕我们得在这山坡上坐上一整天！

"Hmph…" Was the only reply she earned from the redheaded pilot.

"哼……" 这是她从那位红发飞行员那里得到的唯一回应。

Misato could feel her frustration building further. It had been her idea to come up here to the lookout over the city. It was a place that held a special significance to herself and Shinji. It felt safe, filled with shared memories and experience. It was their place. No one could touch them here.

碇真嗣能感觉到自己的挫败感愈发强烈。来到这个俯瞰城市的瞭望台是她的主意。这个地方对她和真嗣有着特殊的意义。它感觉很安全，充满了共同的回忆和经历。这是他们的地方。在这里，没有人能触碰到他们。

She realised with some chagrin as she thought this, that she had never before this time brought Asuka up here.

她想到这里，有些懊恼地意识到，以前从未带明日香来过这里。

"God damn it" she muttered under her breath. It had seemed like an inspired choice an hour ago back at the apartment when things had seemed to have finally reached a head.

“该死的”，她低声咒骂。一个小时前在公寓里，当事情似乎终于到了紧要关头时，这似乎是一个灵感迸发的选择。

Now… now she wasn't so sure.

现在…现在她不那么确定了。

She looked again towards the horizon just as the sun finally split the gloom of the pre-dawn sky and emerged from behind the mountains in the east. Though the air in the post Second Impact night never reached what could have been called "cool" still the morning sun had a power and a heat that could be felt as if it was a physical force.

她再次望向地平线，就在这时，太阳终于撕裂了黎明前的阴霾，从东方的山脉后升起。尽管第二次冲击后的夜晚空气从未达到所谓的“凉爽”，但早晨的阳光却有着一种力量和热度，仿佛是一种有形的推力。

Misato could feel the sweat already beginning to trickle down and collect in the small of her back. She blew her hair up off her forehead and looked back over at her young charge, watching critically as the warmth and light played across the girl's fair skin, causing Asuka to wince and wrinkle her nose in a way that reminded the Major of just how very young the redhead really was.

美里已经能感觉到汗水开始顺着后背往下淌，汇聚在腰间。她吹起额前的头发，回头看向她的年轻被监护人，目光挑剔地观察着温暖和光线在女孩白皙肌肤上嬉戏，使得明日香不由得皱眉皱鼻，这一幕让美里上校意识到这位红发少女其实多么年轻。

'Maybe it's all been too much for her?' The Major thought to herself as she studied both of her charges from the corner of her eye.

美里上校暗自思忖：“或许这一切对她来说太沉重了？”她用眼角余光审视着她的两位被监护人。

Asuka's face remained devoid of readable emotions.

明日香的脸上一如既往地读不出任何情绪。

Shinji, on the other hand, was transparent as ever. The emotions chasing across his young face were as clear to her as her own. The overriding feelings she could tell that they both shared were confusion and above all a deep-seated worry.

另一方面，真嗣一如既往地透明。他年轻面庞上掠过的情感对她来说清晰如己。她能感受到两人共同拥有的主导情绪是困惑，尤其是深植心底的忧虑。

Still the silence weighed down heavily upon the three of them.

寂静依旧沉重地压在三人身上。

'How the hell am I going to get through to her?' The Major thought desperately. For the life of her, she couldn't fathom the redhead's mind or motivations.

'我到底要怎么才能跟她沟通呢？'少校绝望地想。她实在无法理解那个红发女子的想法和动机。

The German girl finally broke the stillness. "It was a simple enough question, Misato. Would you or wouldn't you?"

德国女孩终于打破了沉默：“这问题很简单，真嗣。你会还是不会？”

"There's nothing simple about it! I don't have the time for any of this crap. You said you were going to tell us what's been eating you these last few months, so do it already! Or have you really brought us all the way up here just to mock us?"

这事可不简单！我没时间应付这些破事。你说过要告诉我们这几个月是什么让你心烦意乱，那就快说吧！还是说你真把我们大老远叫来就为了嘲笑我们？

"It wasn't my idea to come up here in the first place, Misato!"

"一开始来这里根本不是我的主意，真嗣！"

"Don't be so obtuse…" 别这么迟钝……

The redhead just laughed at that. It was a bitter, acerbic laugh. Both Misato and Shinji looked at her enquiringly, but she did not answer. She stared out over the city as it gleamed in the golden dawn.

红发女子对此只是冷笑一声，那笑声苦涩而尖刻。无论是美里还是真嗣都好奇地望向她，但她并未回应。她凝视着沐浴在金色晨曦中的城市。

"So this is your special place, huh?" The redhead said quietly after another interminable silence.

"所以这就是你的特别之地，对吧？" 红发女子在又一次漫长的沉默后轻声说道。

"Uh-huh, you could say that." She replied, confused at the sudden change in tone.

"嗯，可以这么说。" 她回答道，对突然转变的语气感到困惑。

"It's pretty up here…" 这里相当美……

"Yeah…" "是啊…"

Shinji still had said nothing since Asuka had posed her original question. Misato couldn't blame him.

自从明日香提出最初的问题后，真嗣一直沉默不语。美里也无法责怪他。

Joke or not, the question had also swirled around and around in her head since the girl had asked it only a few minutes earlier. Swirled until she thought that she would scream with the sheer frustration of it.

无论是玩笑与否，这个问题自几分钟前那个女孩提出后，就在她脑海中不断盘旋。盘旋到她觉得快要因为纯粹的挫败感而尖叫。

"Would… would you guys believe me if I told you… i-if I told you that I was from the future?"

如果我告诉你们……我来自未来，你们会相信我吗？

Ninety minutes earlier 九十分钟前

Asuka looked in the mirror. A pale, though otherwise healthy, redheaded girl stared blearily back at her. Dark grey circles beneath contrasted sharply with the bright blue irises that narrowed as she tried harder to focus. 'This is becoming a really annoying habit' She thought to herself with an inward sneer. The small analogue clock on the bathroom wall showed that it was just after four in the morning.

明日香望向镜子，一个苍白但其他方面健康的红发女孩，眼神迷离地回望着她。深灰色的眼圈与明亮的蓝眼睛形成鲜明对比，随着她努力集中注意力，眼睛眯得更细了。'这真成了个烦人的习惯'，她内心嘲讽地想。浴室墙上的小指针钟显示，刚过凌晨四点。

"Fucking hell, Asuka..." She scowled at her reflection. "How could you have been so goddamn stupid?"

"该死的，明日香……" 她对着镜子中的自己皱眉，"你怎么能这么蠢呢？"

She swung open the bathroom cabinet and grabbed at the box of generic branded paracetamol on the middle shelf. Slurping down a mouthful of water from the tap she quickly swallowed two of the bitter tasting tablets with a grimace.

她猛地拉开浴室柜门，伸手抓起中间架子上的普通品牌扑热息痛药盒。从水龙头猛灌一口水后，她迅速吞下两片苦涩的药片，脸上露出痛苦的表情。

"Bleargh…" She groaned, slamming the cabinet shut forcefully.

"呃……" 她呻吟着，用力将柜门砰地关上。

Sleep had been impossible that night, despite her cocky self-assurance as she had told her puzzled housemates of her plans for letting them in on her long-held secrets. Now, in the clammy darkness of the Tokyo-03 night, things didn't feel so sure. Her unquiet mind was abuzz with self-doubt and anxiety in the place of her earlier self-assurance.

那晚，尽管她自信满满地向困惑的室友们透露了自己打算揭开长久以来秘密的计划，但睡眠依旧遥不可及。此刻，在东京-03 夜晚湿冷的黑暗中，一切似乎都不那么确定了。她那不安的心思被自我怀疑和焦虑所充斥，取代了之前的自信。

Her head pounding with the force of the thoughts and doubts beating at her head, she had finally thrown aside the sheet and stalked out of the bedroom that she and Shinji shared and had sought some comfort in cut-price analgesia.

她的头因纷乱的思绪和疑虑而剧烈疼痛，最终她掀开被子，从与真嗣共用的卧室中悄然走出，寻求廉价止痛药的慰藉。

Asuka had turned all the possible scenarios over and over a thousand times in her head, but there just didn't seem to be a way that the German girl could see to convince the two people she trusted the most in the world of anything that she so desperately wanted to share with them.

明日香在脑海中反复推演了所有可能的情景上千次，但似乎就是找不到任何方法，让这位德国女孩能够说服她在这个世界上最信任的两个人，去相信她迫切想要与他们分享的一切。

She leaned her forehead against the mirror and groaned again. "They're gonna throw me in the looney bin for sure once I tell them." She muttered.

她将额头抵在镜子上，再次呻吟起来。“一旦我告诉他们，他们肯定会把我送进疯人院的。”她喃喃自语。

"I'm sure they'll see how rational I am!" Asuka muttered. "I can just imagine… 'Oh hey, I've actually been sent back in time by Wondergirl from the end of the world where me and zombie-Shin-man eked out an existence on instant noodles and tinned wieners! Oh Third Impact? Yeah, it was pretty intense… I died heroically sacrificing myself in a vain attempt to save everybody while all Shinji did was box a couple of rounds with the one-eyed champ and then spend the rest of the time wallowing in well-deserved self-loathing! But it's alright, I got better… anyways, I'm here to save the world!' Yep… that'll earn me a one-way trip to the NERV nut-hatch with all the drugs that modern medicine can provide!" She grimaced at her reflection in the mirror.

"我敢肯定他们会看到我是多么理智！"明日香嘀咕道，"我都能想象得到……'哦，嘿，我其实被 Wondergirl 从世界末日送回了过去，在那里我和僵尸真嗣靠方便面和罐装香肠勉强生存！第三次冲击？是啊，相当激烈……我英勇牺牲，试图拯救所有人却徒劳无功，而真嗣只是和独眼冠军打了几回合，然后剩下的时间都在享受他应得的自怨自艾！不过没关系，我恢复了……总之，我是来拯救世界的！'没错……这肯定能让我直接被送到 NERV 的精神病院，享受现代医学所能提供的所有药物！"她对着镜子中的自己皱了皱眉。

"There's got to be a better way."

一定有更好的方法。

All she heard in reply was the faint rumble of the late night freight trains rumbling into Tokyo-03.

她听到的回应只有深夜货运列车缓缓驶入东京 03 区的微弱隆隆声。

The redhead let out a heavy sigh as she composed herself and finally left the bathroom, making her way back towards the door of the bedroom she and Shinji shared.

红发女子调整了一下自己的情绪，重重地叹了口气，终于离开了浴室，朝着她和真嗣共用的卧室门走去。

As stealthily as she could she slid the door open so as not to awaken the Third Child from his slumber.

她尽可能悄无声息地推开门，以免惊醒正在熟睡的第三子。

She needn't have bothered.

她本不必费心的。

"Asuka, are you okay?" "明日香，你还好吗？"

"Scheiße." Asuka swore under her breath. "Hey Shinji, what're you doing awake?" She said with a false brightness as she stood at the door.

"该死。" 明日香低声咒骂了一句。"嘿，真嗣，你怎么醒着？" 她站在门口，语气中带着一种刻意的轻快。

"I… I woke up and you weren't next to me." The Third Child said plaintively, propped up on an elbow on the bed that they shared. "I was worried about you."

“我……我醒来时，你不在我身边。”第三适格者哀怨地说道，他们共用的床上，他用手肘支撑着身体。“我很担心你。”

"Baka." She replied without malice. "Can't I even go to the bathroom in the middle of the night without you having some kind of anxiety attack?"

"傻瓜。" 她回答时并无恶意，"难道我半夜去个洗手间，你都要紧张兮兮的吗？"

"Of course! I-It's not that. I just know that something's been bothering you Asuka. I can tell when you're unhappy or worried. Y-You're not very good at hiding your feelings."

当然！我不是那个意思。我只是知道有什么事情一直在困扰着你，明日香。我能看出你什么时候不开心或担忧。你不太擅长隐藏自己的情绪。

"Oh, aren't I?" 哦，难道我不是吗？

"No, you're not." Shinji replied earnestly. "Also you've been tossing and turning all night muttering stuff like "how am I gonna do this?" and "Stupid… stupid…" and stuff like that. It's pretty hard to ignore."

"不，你不是。" 真嗣认真地回答道，"而且你整晚都在翻来覆去，嘴里嘟囔着'我该怎么办？'、'愚蠢……愚蠢……'之类的话。这真的很难忽视。"

'Great work, Asuka' She thought to herself. "Uh… Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you awake."

“干得好，明日香。”她暗自思忖。“呃……抱歉，我不是故意让你睡不着的。”

"You're apologizing to me?" Shinji said. "Are you really sure you're okay? Should I call Doctor Akagi and get you checked out?"

"你在向我道歉吗？" 真嗣说道，"你真的确定自己没事吗？需要我叫赤木医生来给你检查一下吗？"

"Choose wisely your next smart-assed comment, Third." Asuka said with mock-ire. "Or you might be the one requiring medical attention!"

“明智地选择你下一个自作聪明的评论，第三。”明日香带着假装的愤怒说道，“否则你可能就是需要医疗救助的那个人了！”

"Sorry Asuka." 对不起，明日香。

"There," She said with a smirk that didn't reach her eyes. "Now the world is back in balance."

“就在那儿，”她带着一丝未达眼底的笑意说道，“现在世界又恢复平衡了。”

Silence once again enveloped the small apartment as the two pilots stared at each other across the darkened bedroom.

寂静再次笼罩了这间小公寓，两位飞行员在昏暗的卧室中彼此对视。

"Are you going to come back to bed?" Shinji finally spoke.

"你打算回床上来吗？" 真嗣终于开口了。

"Why, so you can have your wicked way with me?" Asuka replied. "I swear you Japanese guys are such perverts!"

"怎么，这样你就可以对我为所欲为了吗？" 明日香回答道，"我发誓你们日本男人真是太变态了！"

"No… I just…" "不…我只是…"

Asuka closed the sliding door, padded over to the bed and sat on the side. "Jeez, I was just joking, baka!"

明日香关上推拉门，轻步走到床边坐下，"哎呀，我只是开玩笑的，笨蛋！"

"Sorry Asuka." 对不起，明日香。

The redhead sighed. "Don't push your luck, Shinji. There are only so many apologies I can take in the course of one night."

红发人叹了口气。“别得寸进尺了，真嗣。一个晚上我能接受的道歉也就那么多。”

"Oh, ummm… sorr…okay." Shinji stumbled over his words. Despite herself, Asuka grinned into the darkness at his discomfiture.

"哦，呃……对不……好吧。" 真嗣结巴着说。尽管自己不想，明日香还是在黑暗中因他的窘迫而露出了笑容。

He pulled back the covers for her to slide back into the bed, but she just remained sitting on the side staring out into the darkness of their room. After a small moments hesitation Shinji scooted over to the side of the bed and swung his legs over the side so that he was sitting next to her. Asuka could feel his nervousness as he gingerly reached over and placed a nervous arm around her shoulders. She gave a small chuckle at his apparent apprehension. Despite all they had gone through, despite the intimacy that they now shared, he was still afraid of offending her with casual contact.

他为她掀开被子，让她重新躺回床上，但她只是坐在床边，凝视着房间的黑暗。短暂的犹豫后，真嗣挪到床边，双腿垂下，坐在她身旁。明日香能感觉到他的紧张，他小心翼翼地伸出手，将一只紧张的手臂搭在她的肩上。她对他的明显忧虑轻声笑了笑。尽管他们经历了那么多，尽管他们现在分享着亲密，他仍然害怕因随意的接触而冒犯她。

"Baka." She whispered. "笨蛋。" 她低声说。

It seemed that Shinji understood because he gave a small laugh as his hand clasped her shoulder more firmly. They settled into a comfortable silence sitting there together for several minutes. Finally Shinji spoke softly, breaking the silence.

似乎真嗣明白了，因为他轻笑一声，手更加坚定地搭在她的肩上。他们一起坐在那里，陷入了几分钟的舒适沉默。最终，真嗣轻声开口，打破了沉默。

"Is it about whatever you're going to talk to us about tomorrow? It that what's got you so worried?"

是关于你明天要和我们谈的事情吗？那就是让你如此担忧的原因吗？

Asuka sighed. "Yeah… I guess you could say that."

明日香叹了口气。“是啊……我想你可以这么说。”

"Why should you be afraid of talking to the two of us, Asuka?" He said. "We're not going to judge you for… "

"为什么你要害怕和我们俩说话，明日香？" 他说，"我们不会因为……"

"Hmph." Asuka interrupted. "Wait 'till you hear what I say before you make any promises you might not be able to keep!"

"哼。" 明日香打断道，"等听完我说的再承诺也不迟，免得到时候你做不到！"

"You're not being fair." 你这样做不公平。

"Maybe not…" 或许不是……

The redhead smiled despite herself. All these months she had been convinced that she was on her own against the universe, hearing the concern in the voice of the person she cared about most in the world filled her heart with a strange thrill that she couldn't quite quell. 'Maybe this might actually work?' She thought. But at the same time, a foreboding was also growing in her breast. She knew what she was up against. She knew deeply, personally, with every fibre of her being and soul that the next few months would be the most brutal, challenging and difficult of her life. Taking on the prelude to Third Impact would make survival in the wilderness look like a picnic in the Black Forest.

红发女子不由自主地笑了。这几个月来，她一直坚信自己是孤身对抗整个宇宙，而此刻，听到她在这个世界上最在乎的人声音中的关切，她的心被一种难以抑制的奇异激动填满。'或许这真的能成功？'她想。但同时，一种不祥的预感也在她心中蔓延。她清楚自己面对的是什么。她深知，从个人经历到灵魂深处，未来几个月将是她一生中最残酷、最具挑战和最艰难的时期。面对第三次冲击的前奏，生存于荒野相比之下，简直就像在黑森林中野餐一样轻松。

Maybe it was actually going to be impossible.

或许实际上这根本不可能。

The dread and fear in her gut would not let her go, she was desperate and tired of being alone in her knowledge, but how in the world was she going to be able to convince Misato and Shinji that she wasn't as crazy as a loon?

她内心的恐惧和不安让她无法释怀，她绝望且厌倦了独自承受这份认知，但究竟要怎样才能让明日香和真嗣相信，她并不像疯子一样疯狂呢？

She wasn't convinced that it was within her powers of persuasion to pull it off.

她并不确信自己有足够的说服力来实现这一目标。

"Shinji…" "真嗣……"

"Yeah?" 是吗？

"Do you think that I'm crazy?"

"你认为我疯了吗？"

"Of course not!" He replied in a hurt tone. "You… You're the strongest person I know, Asuka! There's no way that I could ever…"

"当然不是！" 他带着受伤的语气回答道，"你……你是我认识的最强的人，明日香！我怎么可能……"

"So," Asuka interrupted. "You promise that whatever I say tomorrow, however loopy or unhinged it might seem, you'll believe every word I tell you?"

“那么，”明日香打断道，“你保证无论我明天说什么，无论它听起来多么荒谬或疯狂，你都会相信我说的每一个字吗？”

"O-Of course." "当-当然。"

Asuka found that she had no answer for his sincerity. Her heart pounded loudly in her chest at the thought of what she had to do. It had all seemed so easy earlier. Her natural bravado carrying her through to her cocky promise to let out what amounted to be the biggest secret in the history of the world to her two housemates.

明日香发现自己无法回应他的真诚。一想到必须做的事情，她的心就在胸腔里剧烈跳动。之前这一切似乎都那么简单。她天生的勇气让她自信满满地向两位室友承诺，要揭露堪称世界史上最大的秘密。

"I need you to help me Shinji." She said plaintively. "I don't know how I'm gonna do this!"

"我需要你帮我，真嗣。" 她哀怨地说，"我不知道该怎么做了！"

"Then just do it." Came a voice from the doorway.

“那就去做吧。”门口传来一个声音。

"Mi-Misato!" Shinji exclaimed.

"美里小姐！" 真嗣惊呼道。

"Couldn't help but overhearing your little conversation there…" Their guardian began; pushing the sliding door further open to reveal her nightgown clad body and tousled hair. "And I also think, Asuka, that you should stop over-thinking this, trust us and just tell us whatever it is that's got your knickers in such a twist!"

"不小心听到了你们的悄悄话……" 他们的监护人开口说道，推开滑动门，露出了穿着睡裙的身体和凌乱的头发。"而且我也觉得，明日香，你应该停止过度思考，相信我们，把让你如此烦恼的事情告诉我们吧！"

"So you were spying on us?" Asuka said accusingly.

"所以你一直在监视我们？" 明日香指责地说。

"Hardly." The Major replied with a smirk that could clearly be seen in the pale light streaming through the window. "I don't know if you realize, but these apartment walls are paper-thin, and you two weren't exactly speaking sotto voce either! I could hardly be expected to repose in blissful slumber on my futon while you two hollered your innermost secrets at each other!

"几乎不可能。"少校带着一丝嘲讽回答，那表情在透过窗户的微弱光线中清晰可见。"我不知道你是否意识到，但这些公寓的墙壁薄如纸，你们俩的谈话也绝非低声细语！你们互相大声倾诉内心秘密时，我怎么可能还躺在我的蒲团上安然入睡呢！"

"Fucking great! So if me and Shin-man get busy one night we can expect you to come and join in the fun?"

太棒了！所以如果我和申哥某天晚上忙起来，我们可以期待你来加入我们的乐趣吗？

"Asuka!" Shinji cried out in embarrassment.

"明日香！" 真嗣尴尬地喊道。

"Eww…" Misato said melodramatically. "Firstly, I'd better not ever hear you guys "getting busy" while I'm in this house! Secondly, don't try and change the subject! If your "Big Secret" is eating you up this much, then don't you think that the best thing to do all around is to, I dunno, just tell us already?"

"哎呀…" 美里夸张地说道，"首先，我绝不想在这屋子里听到你们'忙活'的声音！其次，别试图转移话题！如果你的'大秘密'让你这么难受，那你不觉得最好的办法就是，嗯，直接告诉我们吗？"

"It's not that easy…" 这并不容易……

"Why not?"

"Because it isn't!" Asuka yelled with real emotion. "You think if this was something that I could tell you so easily I would have already done it? Are you that dense that you think that I haven't wanted to let you in on this? That maybe I'm sick of doing this all alone?"

"因为根本不是那样！"明日香带着真实的情感喊道，"你以为如果这件事我能轻易告诉你，我还会等到现在吗？你是不是觉得我傻到不想让你知道？或许我已经厌倦了独自承担这一切？"

"That doesn't change anything, Asuka." Misato replied. "Tell us! Tell us and then it's done. I can't put it any plainer than that."

"那并没有改变什么，明日香。" 美里回答道，"告诉我们！告诉我们，然后就结束了。我无法说得比这更直白了。"

Asuka sat there, mulling over her guardian's words. She could feel Shinji's arm squeezing her tightly, offering what silent support he felt capable of. She wanted so badly to unburden herself, but how? It just felt… impossible.

明日香坐在那里，反复思索着监护人的话。她能感觉到真嗣的手臂紧紧地抱着她，尽力给予他所能够的默默支持。她非常渴望倾诉心事，但该怎么做呢？这感觉……简直不可能。

"Look," She said finally. "Let's just forget it. I-I can't do this after all. Maybe…maybe one day I can tell you without you hating me or thinking that I'm crazy… But not yet. I'm not ready yet. I can't…"

"听着，" 她终于开口了，"我们就当没这回事吧。我……我终究还是做不到。或许……或许有一天我能告诉你，而你不会因此讨厌我，或觉得我疯了……但现在还不行。我还没准备好。我做不到……"

"Bullshit, Asuka!" Misato snapped back without even thinking. "You've been holding onto something big for a long time now! Shinji and me are here for you, you know that. I'm not pretending that it's going to be easy to finally open up to us, but you do know that we're the only two people in the world that you can trust. Don't you? That you can tell us what's been eating you without us judging you or thinking that you're crazy! Am I right? So… why don't you just tell us already!"

"胡说，明日香！" 美里毫不犹豫地反驳道，"你已经把一件大事憋在心里很久了！真嗣和我都在这里支持你，你知道的。我并不是假装说向我们敞开心扉会很容易，但你知道我们是世界上唯一两个你可以信任的人。不是吗？你可以告诉我们是什么让你如此困扰，而我们不会评判你，也不会认为你疯了！我说得对吗？所以……你为什么不干脆告诉我们呢！"

"Hmph." Asuka snorted in reply to her plea. "I might just hold you guys to that…"

"哼。" 明日香对她恳求的回应是一声冷哼，"我或许真会要求你们兑现那承诺……"

Back into the silence the three of them fell. The night's stillness lay heavy around them.

三人再次陷入寂静之中，夜晚的静谧沉重地笼罩着他们。

"There's no backing out of this, Asuka." Misato finally broke the silence. "You said last night that you didn't want to do it here?"

"没有退路了，明日香。" 最终，是美里打破了沉默，"你昨晚不是说不想在这里做吗？"

Asuka, and Shinji, just nodded.

明日香和真嗣只是点了点头。

"Cool," The major said with a grin. "I know an awesome place!"

"酷，"少校笑着说，"我知道一个超棒的地方！"

"So this is your special place, huh?"

“所以这就是你的特别之地，对吧？”

"Uh-huh, you could say that."

嗯哼，你可以这么说。

"It's pretty up here…"

这里相当美……

"Yeah…" "嗯…"

'This is like pulling fucking teeth…' Misato thought as yet another silence fell heavily upon the three of them. Somehow this moment, a moment the importance of she did not for a second underestimate, was getting out of her control. 'How the hell do I get things back on track?'

“这简直就像拔牙一样艰难……” 当又一次沉重的沉默笼罩在他们三人之间时，葛城美里这样想着。不知怎的，这个她从未低估其重要性的时刻，正逐渐脱离她的掌控。“我到底该怎么让事情重回正轨？”

"What do you mean, you're from "the future?""

"你说的'来自未来'是什么意思？"

Misato and Asuka both turned to look at Shinji. It was the first time he had spoken since they had arrived at the hilltop lookout. He had been quiet, even for him, since they had got out of the old Alpine A310 and walked to the low steel fence that bordered the hilltop. He had seemed like he had been unable to face whatever revelations the Second Child might spring upon them. Now, in the early morning sunshine, his deep blue eyes shone with emotion as he stared at the redhead. His two housemates knew that look. They had both seen it on their communication screens during the toughest of the Angel battles.

碇真嗣一开口，明日香和美里都转头看向他。这是他们抵达山顶瞭望台后他第一次说话。自从他们从那辆老旧的阿尔派 A310 下车，走到山顶边缘的低矮钢制围栏旁，他就异常沉默，甚至比平时还要寡言。他似乎无法面对第二适格者可能带来的任何惊人消息。此刻，在清晨的阳光下，他那深蓝色的眼睛闪烁着情感的光芒，凝视着红发少女。他的两位室友熟悉这种眼神，在对抗使徒最艰难的战斗中，他们曾在通讯屏幕上见过这样的神情。

Asuka took a step back, momentarily dropping her gaze from his. Then she appeared to compose herself. The Second Child's face turned from her companions as she stared out over the city towards the surrounding hills and mountains.

明日香后退了一步，暂时将目光从他身上移开。随后，她似乎调整了自己的情绪。作为第二适格者，她的脸转向了同伴们，同时凝视着城市，望向周围的丘陵和山脉。

"Shinji." She said softly.

"真嗣。" 她轻声说道。

"Yes." He replied. "是的。" 他回答道。

"Did you mean it?"

你是认真的吗？

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Your promise?" 你的承诺？

"My promise?" "我的承诺？"

"You promised me, just over an hour ago, you promised that whatever I said, however loopy or unhinged it might seem to you, you'd believe every word I told you. Didn't you?"

你在一个多小时前向我承诺过，无论我说什么，无论它在你看来多么荒谬或疯狂，你都会相信我说的每一个字。你不是这样承诺的吗？

Shinji nodded, less confident now. "Uh, yeah. Of course I promise, Asuka."

真嗣点了点头，现在不那么自信了。“呃，是的。我当然答应你，明日香。”

Misato looked between the two pilots, sensing the depth of feeling between them. She suddenly felt like a spectator between them. An intruder into a moment that the two alone should share.

美里在两位驾驶员之间来回看着，感受到了他们之间的深厚情感。她突然觉得自己像是夹在他们中间的旁观者，一个闯入本应只有两人共享时刻的入侵者。

Misato followed the girl's gaze as the redhead sighed, turning her pretty face towards the lightening sky. She seemed to focus on the small dot of a distant bird of prey circling high above the city. It floated effortlessly on the warm morning air.

米萨托顺着红发女孩的目光望去，只见她叹了口气，美丽的脸庞转向渐渐明亮的天空。她的注意力似乎集中在城市上空高高盘旋的一只猛禽的小小身影上。那只鸟在温暖的晨风中轻松地飘浮着。

"Because I'm not joking," Asuka said finally. "And I'm not crazy… At least I'm fairly certain I'm not… So you've both gotta hear me out here, alright?"

因为我不是在开玩笑，" 明日香最后说道，"而且我没有疯……至少我很确定我没有……所以你们俩都得听我说，好吗？

"Alright." Shinji replied earnestly, like he had been entrusted with a sacred promise.

"好的。" 真嗣认真地回答，仿佛被托付了一个神圣的承诺。

"Misato?" Asuka asked, her gaze still on the circling eagle.

"美里？"明日香问道，目光仍停留在盘旋的鹰上。

"Yeah, yeah, I promise! Just spit it out already!"

是的是的，我保证！快说吧！

"Fine!" Asuka said. "Just so we're clear."

好吧！" 明日香说。"只是为了确保我们清楚。

The redhead closed her eyes and took a deep breath.

红发女子闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。

"I know how this ends."

我知道结局如何。

"Ends?" The Major replied questioningly.

"结束？" 少校疑惑地回答。

"Yep, all of it." Asuka replied, her arms sweeping out as if to encompass the whole of Tokyo-03.

"是的，全部。" 明日香回答道，她的手臂挥舞着，仿佛要将整个第三新东京市都囊括其中。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"Third Impact." 第三次冲击。

"Third impact?" Misato echoed.

"第三次冲击？" 碇真嗣重复道。

"Yep, Third Impact." 是的，第三次冲击。

There was a long silence.

一阵长久的沉默。

"Continue." Misato said flatly.

"继续。" 碇真嗣平淡地说。

Taking a deep breath Asuka spoke.

深呼吸后，明日香开口了。

"Your father died in the Second Impact, right?"

你的父亲是在第二次冲击中去世的，对吧？

"Yes. It's not exactly a state secret."

是的，这并非什么国家机密。

"And he gave you that cross that you're wearing just before he died? Literally seconds before Antarctica evaporated?"

就在他去世前，他给了你你现在佩戴的十字架吗？就在南极洲蒸发前的那几秒钟？

"Uh-huh." Misato replied. "What your point?"

"嗯哼。" 碇真嗣回答道，"你的重点是什么？"

"So you're essentially the only person to have survived Second Impact? You were there, at Ground Zero, when the shit hit the fan?"

所以你基本上是唯一一个在第二次冲击中幸存下来的人？当时你就在灾难中心，当一切变得一团糟的时候？

"Yes." 是的。

Out of the corner of her eye Asuka could see Shinji staring at her like he didn't know who she was anymore. She gritted her teeth, she had to see this through.

从眼角余光中，明日香可以看到真嗣正盯着她，仿佛已经不认识她了。她咬紧牙关，必须坚持到底。

"What do you remember of it?"

你对此记得些什么？

"What has that go to do with..."

那与……有何关系？

"Just tell me, please!"

请直接告诉我！

"I-I remember the wind, it was so cold… My father carried me away from the lab to the emergency pods… he…he put me in, I couldn't stop crying…I knew that he hated it when I cried but I couldn't stop, I was so scared." Tears began to appear in the corners of Misato's eyes.

我记得那风，冷得刺骨……父亲抱着我逃离实验室，前往紧急逃生舱……他……他把我放进去，我止不住地哭泣……我知道他讨厌我哭，但我就是停不下来，我太害怕了。" 泪水开始在 Misato 的眼角涌现。

"Then he gave you the cross?"

然后他给了你十字架吗？

Misato nodded. "His arm was all burnt… I even could see the bone showing through the blackened skin… somehow he held the cross over me and-and put in with me. Then he closed the hatch and I never saw him again."

碇司令点了点头。“他的手臂被烧得面目全非……我甚至能看到骨头透过焦黑的皮肤显露出来……不知怎么的，他还是把十字架举在我上方，然后和我一起放了进去。接着他关上了舱门，我再也没有见过他。”

"But you saw the White Giant, didn't you?"

"但你见到了白巨人，对吧？"

"What?" "什么？"

"The White Giant. Just as the hatch closed you saw it, rising out of where the lab had been. You always told yourself it was just your imagination, but you know that you saw it… Adam. Don't you?"

白色巨人。就在舱门关闭的那一刻，你看见了它，从实验室所在的地方升起。你总是告诉自己那只是你的想象，但你清楚你确实看到了……亚当。不是吗？

"How?" Misato started. "I think I saw something… but I can't be sure…"

"怎么回事？" 碇真嗣开始说道，"我觉得我看到了什么……但我不敢确定……"

"Bullshit, Misato. You know."

胡扯，碇真嗣。你知道的。

A frown creased the Major's brow. "I've never talked about this, Asuka. Not to anyone since that day… How the fuck do you know this?" She sounded almost angry that the girl knew something about her that even she seemed to doubt had really happened.

少校的眉头紧皱。“我从没跟人提过这事，明日香。自从那天起，我没对任何人说过……你他妈是怎么知道的？”她听起来几乎有些生气，因为这女孩竟然知道连她自己都似乎怀疑是否真实发生过的事情。

"You showed me." 你向我展示了。

"What?" "什么？"

"You showed me." Asuka repeated. "I told you, "I'm from the future" remember?"

"你向我证明了。"明日香重复道，"我告诉过你，'我来自未来'，记得吗？"

"This isn't funny." 这不好笑。

"You're damn right about that!" The redhead said, her old sneer creeping into her face.

"你说的太对了！"红发女子说道，她那熟悉的冷笑再次爬上了脸庞。

"So tell us then. Stop with all of this cryptic shit and tell us finally."

那就告诉我们吧。别再故弄玄虚了，最终还是得告诉我们。

"I-I'm not sure…" Asuka started.

"我……我不确定……" 明日香开口道。

"Please, Asuka!" Shinji interrupted her. "Tell us. Tell me… I just want to help you! Both of us do!"

求你了，明日香！" 真嗣打断她。"告诉我们，告诉我……我只是想帮助你！我们俩都想！

"Fine." Asuka said with a loud sigh. "Don't blame me if you think that I'm a basket-case after this though!"

"好吧。"明日香大声叹了口气说道，"但如果你之后觉得我是个疯子，可别怪我！"

Neither of her companions replied, they just looked at her with varying degrees of wary expectation.

她的两位同伴都没有回答，只是带着不同程度的谨慎期待看着她。

"Fine." She said again, turning back to face the cityscape. She didn't want to see the looks on their faces when she was telling them. It would take all of her strength just to do this.

"好吧。" 她再次说道，转过身面对着城市景观。她不想看到他们脸上的表情，当她告诉他们时。仅是这样做就需要她全部的力气。

"Third Impact is real. Third Impact will happen. We've got just a couple of months left unless we change things drastically around here." She drew a deep breath. "I know 'cos I've seen it."

"第三次冲击是真的。它将会发生。我们只剩下几个月的时间，除非我们在这里做出彻底的改变。" 她深吸了一口气。"我知道，因为我已经看到了。"

She expected some response, some expression of disbelief from the two standing behind her, but there was nothing.

她期待着身后那两人会有所反应，表现出难以置信的神情，然而什么也没有。

"The next three Angels will essentially make it inevitable that Third Impact will occur. We will defeat them, though the price will be… unbearable. But they will be defeated."

接下来的三个使徒将实质上使得第三次冲击不可避免。我们将击败他们，尽管代价将是……难以承受的。但他们终将被击败。

"Unbearable?" Shinji asked.

"难以忍受吗？" 真嗣问道。

"The next Angel, it will sit in orbit high above Japan. Just sit there essentially minding it's own business. I-I was... will be… would have been… sortied against it... in the past my wounded pride at my defeat by the 14th Angel will make me force myself into the point position. I was angry last time… I hated the world; I hated Shinji for surpassing me, for always rescuing the poor defenceless girls, chauvinist piglet that he is…" The redhead said with a smile. "I hated myself for failing. I pushed myself to the fore… and the Angel destroyed me."

下一个使徒，它将高悬于日本上空的轨道中，基本上就是静静地待在那里，不问世事。我……将会……本应……去迎战它……在过去，我因败给第 14 使徒而受伤的自尊心，会驱使我强行占据先锋位置。上次我愤怒了……我憎恨这个世界；我憎恨真嗣超越了我，总是拯救那些无助的女孩，他那大男子主义的小猪本性……”红发女子微笑着说，“我恨自己失败了。我冲到了前线……然后使徒摧毁了我。”

"Destroyed?" "被摧毁了？"

"Not physically. I was untouched physically, but the Angel violated my mind. Made me re-live the worst moments of my existence, my failures. Show my brittle pride for what it is… w-was. Showed me who I really was. I-It showed me Mama…. A-at the end… she was dead but she still spoke to me. S-she asked me to die with her. Die like that dead eyed fucking doll!"

并非身体上的。我身体上未受触碰，但天使侵犯了我的心灵。让我重温生命中最糟糕的时刻，我的失败。揭示了我脆弱的自尊的真相……曾经是。让我看清了自己真正的模样。它让我看到了妈妈……在最后……她虽已逝去，却仍在对我说话。她请求我与她一同死去。像那个眼神空洞的该死玩偶一样死去！

"Asuka…" Misato said quietly.

"明日香……" 葛城美里轻声说道。

"I was finished from that moment. Useless as a pilot, broken as a person, I shattered like a crystal vase and slipped rapidly into despair and nothingness."

从那一刻起，我就完了。作为飞行员已无用武之地，作为人已支离破碎，我如水晶花瓶般碎裂，迅速滑入绝望与虚无的深渊。

The silence hung thick in the still morning air.

寂静在静谧的晨风中显得格外沉重。

"Wondergirl… Rei… was next." Asuka's eyes were unfocussed. "The next Angel, A kind of energy based double helix that hung above the outskirts of the city. It tried to fuse with her… again it tried to violate her. She was strong… too strong. I couldn't even move to help her, even if I'd wanted to. She self-destructed Unit 00 while holding the Angel to her Eva with its AT Field. She did what I couldn't. She won. She was obliterated. Nothing but a pulverised mess in a plug suit remained. None of us knew that the Commander had a spare of course!"

"奇迹少女…丽…下一个就是她。"明日香的眼神迷离。"下一个使徒，一种基于能量的双螺旋结构，悬挂在城市郊区上空。它试图与她融合…再次试图侵犯她。她很强大…太强大了。我甚至无法动弹去帮助她，即使我愿意。她用 AT 力场将使徒紧贴在她的 EVA 上，同时自爆了零号机。她做到了我做不到的事。她赢了。她被彻底摧毁了。只剩下一件被粉碎的插入栓服。我们当然都不知道指挥官还有备份！"

"A spare?" "备用的？"

"I'll explain later." Asuka replied with a wave of her hand.

"我待会儿再解释。" 明日香摆了摆手回答道。

"So, the last Angel then." Misato asked. "There was only one pilot left by then you're saying. It targeted Shinji?"

“那么，就是最后一个使徒了。” 美里问道，“你是说，到那时只剩下一个驾驶员了。它盯上了真嗣？”

"Yep. It took the most devastating form that it possibly could take."

是的，它以可能最毁灭性的形式出现了。

"What form is that?" 那是什么形式？

"A friend." 一位朋友。

Asuka could feel the confusion emanating from the two behind her. "Who can hurt us the most?" She asked. "Our enemies? Don't be stupid! A mere enemy could never defeat the Great Shinji Ikari! No, a friend, a kind word, a sympathetic smile when it feels like the whole world has abandoned you? To someone like Shinji, that is the most powerful thing in the world!" Asuka paused for effect before continuing more flatly. "A boy comes to Nerv, a new pilot to replace me actually. He offers friendship and understanding to Shinji, unconditionally and openly accepting him for who he is. What do you think your response to this is Shinji?"

明日香能感受到身后两人散发出的困惑。“谁最能伤害我们？”她问道，“是敌人吗？别傻了！区区敌人怎么可能打败伟大的碇真嗣！不，是朋友，一句温暖的话语，一个在你感觉全世界都抛弃你时的同情微笑？对于像真嗣这样的人来说，那才是世界上最强大的力量！”明日香为了强调效果停顿了一下，然后更加平淡地继续说：“一个男孩来到 NERV，实际上是来取代我成为新驾驶员的。他向真嗣伸出了友谊和理解之手，无条件且公开地接纳了他。你认为你对这种情况会作何反应，真嗣？”

"I-I…" "我...我…"

"I'll tell you, you soak it in. A creature, like you were then, drinks in the sympathy and acceptance the world has previously denied you like an emotional sponge. You bond with him and his kindness very quickly."

我会告诉你，你沉浸其中。就像当时的你一样，这个生物如同情感的海绵，吸收着世界先前拒绝给予你的同情与接纳。你很快与他以及他的善良产生了深厚的联系。

"I-I do?" "我-我真的吗？"

"You sure do." Asuka replied. "Unfortunately, for you, this boy is also the 17th Angel."

"你确实如此。" 明日香回答道。"不幸的是，对你而言，这个男孩也是第 17 使徒。"

"What?" Misato exclaimed.

"什么？" 美里惊呼道。

"Yep, skinny little creep, by all accounts. I never actually met him, what with being catatonic and all. Not that anybody really seemed to care about that!" Asuka said with a hint of bitterness. "But Shinji seems to fall for him. If I didn't know better, Third, I'd wonder if you didn't bat for the other team!"

“没错，根据所有描述，他是个瘦小的怪胎。我其实从未见过他，毕竟我一直处于木僵状态。似乎也没人真正在乎这一点！”明日香带着一丝苦涩说道，“但真嗣似乎对他情有独钟。如果不是我更了解情况，第三，我都要怀疑你是不是站在另一边了！”

"How… What…" Misato started before lapsing into confused silence.

"怎么…什么…" 米莎托开口后陷入了困惑的沉默。

"Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just not really into love triangles is all."

倒不是说那有什么不好，我只是不太喜欢三角恋罢了。

"I still don't understand what you're saying, Asuka!" The major snapped.

"我还是不明白你在说什么，明日香！"少校厉声说道。

"Exactly." Asuka said in reply. "Our little Shinji-kun going all doe-eyed over some bishie Angel! I always knew you were a bit of a weirdo!"

"没错。"明日香回应道，"我们的小真嗣对某个美男子天使露出那种眼神！我早就知道你有点怪怪的！"

"Asuka!" Misato spat out finally.

"明日香！" 最终，葛城美里脱口而出。

"To be fair, I can't blame you, Shinji." The redhead continued. "I mean I was lapsing into an unexpectedly sexy coma, Misato was obsessed with avenging Kaji's death and even the new Wondergirl was just fresh out of the tank, what was there left for you? A kindly, though somewhat creepy, kid comes along, is nice to you for a couple of days and you're suddenly all "Yea verily, I have found my true friend and soul-mate!"

“说句公道话，我不能怪你，真嗣。”红发人继续说道，“我的意思是，我意外地陷入了性感的昏迷，美里一心想要为加持的死复仇，就连新来的奇迹女孩也才刚从培养槽里出来，你还有什么选择呢？一个和善却略带诡异的孩子出现，对你好几天，你突然就全心全意地认为‘是的，我找到了真正的朋友和灵魂伴侣！’”

"Wait… Kaji dies?" Misato exclaimed.

"等等……加持死了？" 葛城美里惊呼道。

"Last time around he did." Asuka replied matter-of-factly. "Though I'm hoping that we can avoid that this time if possible. I tried to warn him about Seele a while back, but I don't think that he believed me."

上一次他的确是那样。”明日香实事求是地回答，“不过我希望这次如果可能的话，我们能避免那种情况。我之前试图警告他关于 Seele 的事，但我觉得他并没有相信我。”

"Seele?" "灵魂？"

"Yep." Asuka replied. "You know those shows late night on cable where guys with weird hair and neck-beards claim that there's a cabal of super-powerful old men using their influence and alien technology to control Humanity?"

"嗯。" 明日香回答道，"你知道那些深夜有线电视节目吗？里面那些头发怪异、留着络腮胡子的家伙声称，有一群超级有权势的老人利用他们的影响力和外星技术来操控人类。"

Misato's brow creased in confusion as she stared at her young charge. "Yeah…" She said warily. "You mean like the Bavarian Illuminati or the Freemasons or someone like that?"

碇真嗣的眉头因困惑而皱起，他凝视着年轻的受监护人。“是啊……”她小心翼翼地说。“你指的是像巴伐利亚光照派或共济会之类的组织吗？”

"Yeah, well that part's all bullshit, but if they said Seele and the Human Instrumentality project they'd be a lot closer to the mark. They'd also probably be dead."

是啊，那部分全是胡扯，但如果他们提到 Seele 和人类补完计划，那就更接近真相了。他们可能也因此丧命。

"Before the Angel attack… the 12th… the black shadow… you talked about this to Kaji, didn't you? You warned him about something called 'The Human Instrumentality Project'. You told him that it would get him killed?"

在天使袭击之前……第 12 个……那个黑色影子……你跟加持提过这件事，对吧？你警告他提防一个名为“人类补完计划”的东西。你告诉他那会让他丧命？

"He told you about that?" Asuka said with surprise. "Well, that's something I guess. Hopefully he's paid attention and reined in his curiosity a little!"

"他跟你说了那件事？" 明日香惊讶地说道，"嗯，我想这算是个事儿吧。希望他真的注意到了，稍微收敛一下他的好奇心！"

"Do you really think…?" Misato began before Shinji interrupted them both.

"你真的认为…？" 碇真嗣在两人被打断之前插话道。

"I-I become friends with an Angel?"

"我-我成了天使的朋友？"

They both turned to face the Third Child. His deep blue eyes standing out in his pale face.

两人都转向面对第三子，他那深邃的蓝眼睛在苍白的脸上格外显眼。

"Yes, you do, Shinji-kun." Asuka replied, turning away from her companions once again. "You two become inseparable very quickly."

"是的，你确实如此，真嗣君。"明日香回答道，再次转过身去，不再看向她的同伴们。"你们俩很快就变得形影不离了。"

The silence was heavy for the German girl. Heavy with the anticipation, the dread, of what she knew she would have to say. She hated herself for it, but she knew that she had to shock them to keep their attention.

对于那位德国女孩来说，沉默沉重得令人窒息。这沉默中充满了她即将不得不说的预感和恐惧。她为此厌恶自己，但深知必须用震撼的方式来维持他们的注意力。

"So when you kill him, Shinji, you are more deeply broken than you could even imagine."

所以，当你杀死他时，真嗣，你的内心破碎程度远超你所能想象。

"I-I kill him?" Shinji asked, eyes wide and voice quavering.

"我...我杀了他？" 真嗣问道，眼睛睁得大大的，声音颤抖着。

"You squish him in the hand of your Eva. You know, I do believe that his head pops clean off!"

你用你的伊娃之手将他捏扁。你知道吗，我真相信他的头会彻底爆掉！

"Asuka!" Misato said warningly.

"明日香！" 美里警告地说。

"There's no point goddamn sugar-coating it!"

“根本没有必要他妈的给它裹上糖衣！”

Asuka was happy that she couldn't see the faces of her companions at that moment. She was certain that they would be regarding her as if she were delusional and unstable, 'who knows,' she thought to herself, 'maybe they're right?'

那一刻，明日香很庆幸看不到同伴们的脸。她确信他们会像看待一个妄想且不稳定的人一样看待她，'谁知道呢，'她暗自思忖，'也许他们是对的？'

"So anyway, the Angels are all gone, everything's great, right?" Asuka continued, pausing for effect once more. "Happy times and world peace ensue and everyone gets a puppy!"

“所以，天使们都走了，一切都很好，对吧？”明日香继续说道，再次停顿以增强效果。“幸福时光和世界和平随之而来，每个人都能得到一只小狗！”

Her companions just stared at her without speaking.

她的同伴们只是默默地盯着她，一言不发。

"Not really," She continued wearily. "Actually, it gets worse. Seele, you should really ask Kaji about them sometime, well they decide that decide that Nerv is not being enough of their bitch anymore, so they get the UN rescind the special protection Nerv has enjoyed up to this point and sic the JSSDF on us."

"其实不然，"她疲惫地继续说道，"实际上，情况更糟。Seele，你真该找个时间问问 Kaji 关于他们的事，他们觉得 Nerv 不再那么听话了，于是就通过联合国撤销了 Nerv 迄今为止享有的特殊保护，并让日本自卫队来对付我们。"

"They what?" 他们什么？

"Yep, they send in the troops, convincing the Government that Nerv is out to cause 3rd Impact ironically. Pretty much everyone we know is killed violently, brutally. Most of them either hiding in broom closets or cowering under their desks begging for their lives.

是的，他们派出了军队，说服政府认为 Nerv 有意引发讽刺性的第三次冲击。我们认识的几乎所有人都被残忍地杀害了。他们中的大多数要么躲在扫帚柜里，要么蜷缩在桌子下乞求饶命。

"I even snap out of my coma, open up a can of badass and beat up the JSSDF and even their Production Evas before my batteries die. Big damn hero, huh?"

我甚至从昏迷中惊醒，开启狂暴模式，在电池耗尽前痛击日本自卫队和他们的量产型 EVA。真是个了不起的英雄，对吧？

No one answered her assertion.

没有人回应她的断言。

"Fine. Anyways, the Production Evas, I'll explain them to you later, they were less dead than I had hoped. They reactivated and skewered my Eva and essentially ate it, and me inside of it of course, alive."

好吧。不管怎样，关于生产型 EVA，我晚点再跟你解释，它们比我希望的还要不那么死透。它们重新激活了，刺穿了我的 EVA，基本上把它连同里面的我一起活生生地吞噬了。

"Asuka…" Misato began. "明日香……" 美里开口道。

The redhead turned around and faced them. Both of them could clearly see the tears running unheeded down her pale face in the pale morning light. "I got better though…" She paused and sniffed noisily. "How are we doing so far?" She asked. "Ready to call the funny-farm yet?"

红发女子转过身来面对他们，两人都能清楚地看到，在清晨的微光中，泪水无助地顺着她苍白的脸颊流淌。“但我已经好多了……”她停顿了一下，大声地吸了吸鼻子。“我们目前进展如何？”她问道，“准备好叫精神病院了吗？”

As if on cue, Misato's cell-phone began to ring shrilly in the still morning air. The major grimaced apologetically and pressed a button on the device, bringing the phone up to her ear.

仿佛是应景一般，在清晨静谧的空气中，葛城美里的手机突然尖锐地响了起来。少校面露歉意地皱了皱眉，按下设备上的按钮，将手机贴近耳边。

"Katsuragi here." She snapped. After a few more seconds of listening her features softened slightly.

"这里是葛城。" 她厉声说道。又过了几秒钟，听着听着，她的表情稍微缓和了一些。

"Funnily enough, we were just talking about you. It's not like you to be up this early!"

说来有趣，我们刚才还在谈论你呢。你可不像是会这么早起床的人！

Asuka and Shinji stared at each other as Misato continued her phone call. The Third Child dropped his eyes from hers after a short time and seemed to be focussed on the ground just in front of Asuka.

明日香和真嗣互相对视着，而美里继续在打电话。过了一会儿，第三适格者移开了目光，似乎专注于明日香面前的地面。

"Tell me what you're thinking, Shinji." Asuka said.

"告诉我你在想什么，真嗣。" 明日香说道。

The boy continued his staring without answering.

男孩继续盯着看，没有回答。

"Do you think that I'm nuts?"

"你认为我疯了吗？"

"N-No… of course not…" He replied. "But this is a lot to take in…"

"不，当然不是……" 他回答道，"但这一切太难以接受了……"

"You think?" The redhead replied, her features softening. "If I thought that there was a way to avoid this, don't you think that I'd take it? I haven't even got to the really weird parts of the story yet!"

"你这么认为吗？"红发女子回答道，她的表情缓和了下来。"如果我觉得有办法避免这一切，你认为我不会去尝试吗？我甚至还没讲到故事中最离奇的部分呢！"

"I-I can hardly wait…" Shinji said with a wary smile.

"我-我简直迫不及待…" 真嗣带着一丝戒备的微笑说道。

Before they could continue their awkward conversation any further they were interrupted by Misato snapping her phone shut.

在他们能继续那尴尬的对话之前，他们被美里啪的一声合上手机打断了。

"Right." The Major said. "That, funnily enough, was Kaji."

“对。”少校说道，“说来也巧，那正是卡吉。”

"You don't say?" Asuka replied.

"不会吧？" 明日香回答道。

"I do." Misato said. "我愿意。" 碇真嗣说道。

"What did he want?"

他想要什么？

"Apparently there's some "stuff" going on that he would very much like to talk to me about." Misato answered. "I told him that there was some thing more important than whatever he had to discuss with me that we had to talk about with him."

显然，有些事情正在发生，他非常想和我谈谈。" 碇真嗣回答道，"我告诉他，有比他想要和我讨论的任何事情都更重要的事情，我们必须和他谈谈。"

"We?" "我们？"

"Yep." The Major replied with a small smile that didn't reach her eyes. "You're gonna finish your story Asuka, but I want Kaji to hear it too!"

"嗯。"少校回答道，嘴角挂着一丝未及眼底的微笑。"你会讲完你的故事的，明日香，不过我也想让卡吉听听！"

"Kaji? But… " "加治？但是……"

"This is not a request, Asuka." Misato said. "What you've told me so far, while verging on unbelievable and even possibly delusional, is still hitting close to the bone with what little I now about what's going on here. Kaji knows more than all of us about the big picture, and I trust him, at least insofar as this is concerned. We're going to his place and you're gonna tell all of us everything that you know!"

"这不是请求，明日香。" 美里说，"尽管你告诉我的事情近乎难以置信，甚至可能有些妄想，但它仍然触及了我对这里发生事情的有限了解的核心。关于大局，加持比我们任何人都清楚，我信任他，至少在这件事上是这样。我们要去他家，你得把你知道的一切都告诉我们！"

"Misato! I…" "美里！我……"

"No buts!" Misato interrupted. "This is not a request, it's an order Asuka! Get in the car, both of you!"

"没有可是！" 美里打断道，"这不是请求，是命令，明日香！你们两个，上车！"

Muttering to herself and wondering just how she'd managed to lose control of the situation so quickly and unexpectedly Asuka walk to the car with Shinji in tow behind her. Climbing into the back seat with the Third Child next to her the German girl looked out of the window at the clear blue sky that had replaced the pale sunrise of so short a time ago.

阿苏卡一边自言自语，一边纳闷自己怎么这么快就失去了对局面的控制，而且还是那么出乎意料。她带着真嗣走向车子。两人坐进后座，第三适格者紧挨着她，这位德国女孩望向窗外，只见不久前还是苍白日出的天空，此刻已被清澈的蔚蓝所取代。

It had taken her months and more courage than she felt she had ever had to use to start telling her story to the two people she trusted more than anyone in the whole world. Now she was going to have to do it again. For a man whom she had once thought that she loved. A man that she knew had loyalties on multiple sides in the struggle for the soul of humanity. A man who had died because his search for truth had been more important to him than his own preservation.

她花了数月时间，鼓起了比她自认为曾拥有的还要多的勇气，才开始向她在这个世界上最为信任的两个人讲述自己的故事。现在，她不得不再次这么做。为了一个她曾以为自己深爱的男人。一个她知道在争夺人类灵魂的斗争中，忠诚于多方的男人。一个因为追求真理比自我保全更重要而丧生的男人。

She had thought that maybe she could save him by warning him subtly of the danger that he faced. That hope had been in vain. If she told him what she knew, then everything would change. She would put her fate, and those of the people she loved out of her control and into his.

她曾以为或许能通过巧妙地提醒他面临的危险来拯救他，但这一希望落空了。如果她告诉他所知的一切，那么一切都将改变。她将把自己的命运，以及她所爱之人的命运，从自己的掌控中交到他手中。

She trusted Kaji, but feared his agenda may not necessarily fit in with what she hoped to achieve by telling Shinji and Misato about her trials and tribulations of the last year or so in her personal timeline.

她信任卡吉，但担心他的目的可能与她希望通过向真嗣和美里透露自己过去一年左右个人时间线上的考验和磨难所希望达成的目标不一致。

Now she was on her way to tell her story to the man who had played a key role in the different factions distrust of each other and who's death had help put in place the final elements of the destruction that had been the lead up to 3rd Impact.

此刻，她正前往向那位在各派系间播下不信任种子的关键人物讲述自己的经历，此人的离世助力完成了毁灭进程的最后环节，而这一进程正是第三次冲击的前奏。

"Well, there's no stopping this train now…" She muttered.

“唉，现在这趟列车是停不下来了……”她喃喃自语道。

"What was that, Asuka?" Shinji asked.

"那是什么，明日香？" 真嗣问道。

"Nothing," She replied. "Let's just get this over with!"

"没什么，" 她回答道，"我们赶紧把这事办完吧！"

The blue A310 sped off the grass verge and with a squeal of rubber blasted its way toward the shining metal and glass centre of Tokyo 03.

蓝色 A310 飞机从草坪边缘疾驰而出，伴随着橡胶摩擦的尖锐声响，向着东京 03 那闪耀着金属与玻璃光芒的中心地带猛冲而去。

This has been sitting unloved on my computer for… maybe 12 months or so. It was about the 4th iteration of this chapter that I've attempted and the only one that I didn't delete. Though it did come close ...

这份文档在我电脑里无人问津已经……大概 12 个月左右了。这是我尝试过的第四版这一章节，也是唯一没有被删除的一版。尽管它差点就……

It doesn't tell the whole story, but sets up future events and gives me something to work with for future chapters. It's not perfect, but it gets me to a point where I can move forward.

它虽未讲述完整的故事，却为后续事件埋下伏笔，并为未来章节提供了可发挥的空间。虽非完美，但足以让我迈步向前。

I can only apologise for the looooooooooong time between chapters and this somewhat incomplete and rather expositional installment.

对于章节之间漫长的等待时间，以及这一章节内容略显不完整且过于直白的表达，我只能表示歉意。

I never gave up on this story, it has always been important to me, I just felt like my ability to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion was, well, broken. Maybe... just maybe.. it isn't.

我从未放弃过这个故事，它对我来说一直很重要，我只是觉得我无法将其带向一个令人满意的结局，嗯，能力似乎破碎了。也许……只是也许……并非如此。

How it ends will be very different from how I pictured when I first wrote about Asuka picking her way through the ruins of Tokyo- 03 so long ago, but for better or worse, I believe that it will achieve an ending.

结局将与我最初描写飞鸟在东京-03 废墟中穿行时所想象的截然不同，但无论好坏，我相信它终将达成一个结局。

Cheers 干杯
