Tokyo-2, Japan - Christmas Eve, 2029  
日本东京-2 - 2029 年圣诞前夕

Christmastime has come to the citizens of Tokyo-2. As the people of the city went about their business, one person was hard at work.  
圣诞季已至东京-2，市民们各自忙碌，而其中一人正埋头苦干。

Inside the massive complex that housed the world headquarters of the United Nations, the person in question was in fact, a young woman. Only twenty-nine years old, she was in fact, the youngest person to ever hold the rank of Captain in the United Nations.  
在联合国世界总部所在的宏伟建筑群中，这位备受关注的人物其实是一位年仅二十九岁的女性。她不仅是联合国史上最年轻的上尉，更以其卓越能力引人注目。

She was inside her office, located on the fiftieth floor of the complex. She was very beautiful, the product of an American father and a Japanese-German mother, thus giving her an unique appearance, as she boasts many Asian features, such as the shape of her face and her almond-shaped eyes, while possessing the normal Caucasian facial coloring. Her red hair, once long, was now cut short (think Silent Hill's Heather Morris). Piercing blue eyes which revealed great intelligence were at the moment scanning several documents on her desk. She was dressed like a professional - the blue combat fatigues of the United Nations, complete with rank. Spit-shined boots adorned her feet.  
她身处综合大楼五十层的办公室内，美丽非凡，是美籍父亲与日德混血母亲的完美结合，赋予她独一无二的外貌。她拥有诸多亚洲特征，如脸型和杏仁眼，同时肤色却如典型白人。曾经的长红发如今剪短，酷似《寂静岭》中的希瑟·莫里斯。那双深邃的蓝眼睛闪烁着智慧的光芒，此刻正专注地审视着桌上的文件。她身着联合国蓝色作战服，军衔显赫，脚踩擦得发亮的靴子，尽显专业风范。

"Captain Shikinami, it's quitting time."  
Captain Shikinami, it's time to knock off.

Asuka Shikinami looked up from her work. Her commanding officer had stuck his head inside her office. "You can go, sir," she replied. "I'm gonna stay here and catch up on some work."  
明日香·式波从手头的工作中抬起头，只见指挥官探头进了她的办公室。“长官，您先走吧，”她回应道，“我得留下来，把工作补一补。”

Her commanding officer, a man in his late forties by the name of Kitamura, entered the room. "Captain Shikinami, go home. You may be one the best in linguistics, but even you need to take some time off. Working non-stop is unhealthy, even for a former prodigy like yourself."  
她的指挥官，一位名叫北村、年近五十的男子走进房间，说道：“式波队长，回家休息吧。你在语言学领域虽是佼佼者，但也要适时放松。即便是你这样的昔日天才，也不宜无休止地工作。”

Asuka stopped what she was doing so she could focus her attention on her boss. "I'm fine, Colonel. Really, I'm just about done."  
明日香停下手中的活，专心应对上司。“我很好，上校。真的，我快做完了。”

"You're a lousy liar, Shikinami," Kitamura replied. "So what's eating you?"  
你撒谎真不行，式波，" 北村说，"到底是什么事让你这么烦心？

"Christmas is...a stressful time for me, sir," Asuka replied. "My mother...she died this very night when I was a child. She hanged herself."  
圣诞节对我而言...是个充满压力的时刻，先生，" 飞鸟答道，"我的母亲...在我幼年时的这个夜晚离世了。她是自缢而亡的。

"And your father?" 那你父亲呢？

"Died three years ago. Car accident."  
三年前因车祸去世。

Kitamura decided to drop the subject. "Captain...go home and rest. I do not want to hear that you spent Christmas working again." When it looked like that Asuka was going to argue, Kitamura dropped the nail in the coffin. "That's an order, Captain. Be out of here in thirty minutes."  
北村决定不再深究此事。"队长，您回家休息吧。我不希望再听到您圣诞节还在工作。" 见阿苏卡似要辩驳，北村果断下了结论。"这是命令，队长。三十分钟内离开这里。"

The conversation finished, Kitamura departed from her office, leaving the woman alone.  
谈话结束后，北村离开了办公室，留下那位女士独自一人。

Asuka stood up and walked over to the window, looking down on the citizens of Tokyo-2 as they scurried about their business. Not even the rain had dampened the season, as the people finished up their shopping.  
明日香起身走向窗前，俯视着东京第二区的市民们，他们正忙碌地奔波于各自的日常。即便雨水连绵，也未曾减弱这个季节的繁忙，人们仍在抓紧完成购物。

Asuka turned around and looked at the three pictures on her desk. The first was that of herself as a child with her mother, Kyokou Zeppelin Sohryuu. The second picture was that of her estranged husband Shin Shikinami, and their daughter, Kei. That photo made her smile. Her five-year-old daughter was the light of her otherwise dreary life.  
明日香转身凝视着桌上的三幅照片。首张是她幼年与母亲京子·齐柏林·惣流的合影。次张则是她与分居丈夫真·式波及女儿惠的合影，此照令她嘴角上扬。她那五岁的女儿，犹如她灰暗生活中的一抹亮色。

The last was from when she was fourteen. Her hair was longer than it was now. she was also not alone in the photo. Three more persons - a boy and two women - were also there. The elder women looked to be in her late twenties, with dark purple hair, flashing a V towards the camera. The second girl looked to be about fourteen, with skin the color of alabaster. The girl's unique features was her short blue hair and her eyes, the irises the color of crimson. The last person in the photo was that of the boy around the same age as herself and the other girl, with short dark brown hair and cobalt eyes. Unlike the blue-haired girl, whose expression remained stoic, the boy had a shy smile on his face. All three were dressed in their school uniforms, while the older woman was dressed in a military uniform, complete with beret.  
最后一张照片是她十四岁时的。那时她的头发比现在更长。照片中，她并非独自一人，还有另外三个人——一个男孩和两个女人。年长的女性约莫二十七八岁，一头深紫色的秀发，对着镜头比了个 V 字手势。第二个女孩大约也是十四岁，肤色白皙如雪花石膏。她的独特之处在于那短短的蓝色头发和深红色的眼眸。照片中的最后一个人是与她和另一个女孩同龄的男孩，他有着短短的深棕色头发和钴蓝色的眼睛。与始终面无表情的蓝发女孩不同，男孩脸上挂着羞涩的微笑。 三人均穿着各自的校服，那位年长的女性则身着军装，并佩戴着贝雷帽。

'I still don't know why I kept this picture,' Asuka thought darkly. 'It's not like the drunk, the baka and the doll actually cared for me.'  
'我依旧不明白为何要留着这张照片，' 明日香心情沉重地思索。'毕竟那醉汉、傻瓜和玩偶从未真正关心过我。'

Even after all this time, the picture brought back memories. Memories she had long since suppressed, but came creeping back when she least expected.  
尽管时光已逝，这张照片依旧勾起了她的回忆。那些久被压抑的记忆，总在她毫无防备时悄然浮现。

For Asuka, it had been fifteen years. Fifteen years since she had left Tokyo-3. Fifteen years since the Angel Wars had came to an abrupt and unexpected end.  
对明日香而言，时光已流逝十五载。十五年前，她告别了第三新东京市。同样在十五年前，天使战争戛然而止，结局出人意料。

It had all came down shortly after Arael's attack. In the days following that attack, Asuka had left Tokyo-3. As she was en-route back to Germany, NERV Supreme Commander Gendou Rokubungi Ikari was deposed and arrested on the orders of the UN Security Council, as was the 12 members of the SEELE Committee, for crimes against humanity, as well as the crime of genocide, as the truth behind the calamity known as 'Second Impact' became known to the world.  
阿拉尔攻击后不久，局势急转直下。在接下来的日子里，明日香离开了第三新东京市，踏上了返回德国的旅程。与此同时，NERV 的最高指挥官碇源堂被联合国安理会罢免并逮捕，SEELE 委员会的 12 名成员也因反人类罪和种族灭绝罪被捕，第二次冲击背后的真相终于大白于天下。

As it turned out, it was Gendou's own son, Shinji Ikari, the Third Child and pilot of EVA Unit One, along with his Deputy Commander, Kouzou Fuyutsuki, and NERV's chief scientist/senior medical officer Ritsuko Akagi, who exposed his crimes for all to see.  
最终揭露真相的，是碇源堂的儿子，第三适格者兼 EVA 初号机驾驶员碇真嗣，以及他的副手冬月耕造和 NERV 的首席科学家兼高级医疗官赤木律子，他们共同将碇源堂的罪行暴露无遗。

It all started with Gendou abandoning Shinji as a child following the 'death' of Yui Ikari, Shinji's mother. Ten years later, Shinji was summoned to Tokyo-3 just as the Angel Wars had begun and forced to pilot the Evangelion Unit 01. Despite being hailed as the city's savior, his relationship with his father did not improve.  
故事始于源渡在碇唯“离世”后遗弃了幼年的真嗣。十年匆匆，使徒战争打响之际，真嗣被召至第三新东京市，不得不驾驶 EVA 初号机。虽然被尊为城市的守护者，他与父亲的关系依旧僵化。

It would become Gendou's downfall.  
这将是源渡垮台的原因。

It was after Bardiel's attack, which left Shinji's friend Touji Suzuhara crippled thanks to his father activating the Dummy Plug system within Unit 01 that Shinji's hatred of his father grew. He was not without allies. Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki, Doctor Akagi, and even Ryoji Kaji – thought to have been killed shortly after Zeruel's attack – worked together to bring Gendou and SEELE to its knees.  
巴迪尔袭击后，因父亲启动零号机内的傀儡系统导致好友铃原东治残疾，真嗣对父亲的恨意愈发强烈。但他并非孤军奋战，副司令冬月、赤木博士，以及被误以为在塞路尔事件后不久遇害的加持良治，他们共同合作，试图让源渡和 SEELE 屈服。

It was during the aftermath of Arael's attack, that Shinji and his allies made their move. Accompanied by a squad from the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Forces and several high-ranking officers from the UN, Gendou was arrested. All over the world, the twelve SEELE members were also brought down. Both Fuyutsuki and Ritsuko was granted immunity from the charges in exchange for their testimonies against the former commander and SEELE.  
在 Arael 袭击事件的余波中，真嗣与盟友们展开了行动。在日本战略自卫队的一支小队及联合国数名高级官员的陪同下，碇源堂遭到逮捕。与此同时，全球范围内的十二名 SEELE 成员也纷纷落网。作为交换，冬月和律子因提供了针对前指挥官及 SEELE 的证词而获得了豁免权。

It was Shinji who had accidentally discovered his father's motives while searching for information on his mother. He had discovered that his mother's father was a member of SEELE, and had stumbled upon the grand scheme that both himself and his fellow pilot Rei Ayanami were to take part in, as well as their hand in unleashing Second Impact.  
真嗣在探寻母亲信息的过程中，偶然揭露了父亲的真正意图。他得知母亲的父亲隶属于 SEELE，并意外发现了涉及自己和另一位驾驶员绫波丽的庞大计划，以及他们与第二次冲击爆发的关联。

The entire world was in a complete uproar when the truth behind Second Impact became known. Gendou and Chairman Keel Lorenz were both compared to Hitler and Stalin for their crimes of genocide, while Shinji was hailed as a hero for stopping his father, along with the newly-appointed Commander Fuyutsuki, Kaji and Ritsuko. Misato was especially furious, given the fact that she herself was the sole survivor of the Katsuragi Expedition into what was once was Antarctica, in which Gendou had triggered Second Impact on SEELE's orders, which ended with the death of her father, the members of the expedition and several billion people on the planet. It had taken both Ritsuko and Kaji to restrain Misato, who had tried to gun Gendou down.  
第二次冲击真相曝光后，全球一片哗然。碇源堂与基尔·洛伦兹主席因种族灭绝罪行被比作希特勒和斯大林，而真嗣则因阻止父亲及新任指挥官冬月、加持和律子而被誉为英雄。美里尤为愤怒，她作为唯一幸存者，曾参与了葛城探险队深入昔日南极的行动，在那里，碇源堂遵照 SEELE 指令引发了第二次冲击，导致其父、探险队成员及全球数十亿人丧生。最终，是律子和加持联手制止了试图枪杀碇源堂的美里。

Asuka was then replaced by another pilot from the American branch, one Mari Illustrious Makinami. Both Mari and Rei would go on and finish off the last two remaining Angels - the Angel of the Womb, Armisael, and the Angel of Free Will, Tabris, who was going by the name Kaworu Nagisa.  
之后，来自美国分部的另一名驾驶员——玛丽·伊拉修斯·真希波接替了明日香的位置。玛丽与绫波丽共同作战，成功击败了最后两体使徒——子宫天使阿尔米塞尔和自由意志天使塔布里斯，后者以渚薰的身份出现。

Rei had fought Armisael first. The Angel had tried to absorb her into itself, only to have Rei turn the tables on the Angel, absorbing it into her Unit Zero, and also obtaining its S² Organ.  
绫波丽率先迎战亚弥赛尔。使徒本欲吞噬她，不料绫波丽反客为主，将使徒融入零号机，并成功获取其 S²引擎。

Asuka had watched from NERV's Germany office as Mari fought Tabris - the former inside her Unit Five, and the latter in Asuka's Unit Two. The battle raged near the ruins of the NERV testing facility at Matsushiro. Mari had defeated Tabris after a prolonged battle. Needless to say, Asuka was royally pissed to see Makinami's Unit Five take apart her EVA. In desperation, Tabris activated the self-destruct sequence on Unit Two, forcing Mari to retreat from the resulting blast, which reduced the Matsushiro facility into a giant smoking crater. The pissed feeling turned into anguish and loss, as for a long while Unit Two had been part of her, more than she'd admit to anyone else.  
明日香在 NERV 德国办公室目睹了玛丽与塔布里斯的对决——玛丽驾驶五号机，而塔布里斯则操控着明日香的二号机。战斗在松代 NERV 测试设施的废墟附近激烈展开。经过长时间的较量，玛丽最终战胜了塔布里斯。可想而知，看到真希波的五号机拆解自己的 EVA，明日香怒不可遏。在绝望中，塔布里斯启动了二号机的自毁程序，迫使玛丽撤退，随后的大爆炸将松代设施化为一个巨大的冒烟弹坑。愤怒转化为深深的痛苦与失落，因为二号机对她来说曾是如此重要，尽管她从未向任何人透露过这份情感。

With that final battle, the Angel Wars came to an end, ushering in a time of peace and prosperity for the city of Tokyo-3. Then, they came.  
随着那场最终决战的落幕，天使战争画上了句号，东京-3 市迎来了和平繁荣的新时期。然而，他们降临了。

The Revanants. 《幽灵》。

Bastardized forms of the Angels – demons were more like it – more than ready to finish what the Angels had failed to do. With ADAM destroyed, the only way to initiate Third Impact was by Lilith.  
那些被扭曲的天使形态，更准确地说，是恶魔，正急切地想要完成天使们未竟的任务。由于 ADAM 已被摧毁，启动第三次冲击的唯一途径便是通过莉莉丝。

But once again, NERV has rose to the occasion. Led by their Supreme Commander – who chose to remain unknown, NERV has unleashed its second-generation Evangelions – five in total, from Unit Zero to Unit Four – to fight for humanity. Thus, the Revanant Wars has begun. So far, Tokyo-3 did not suffer the damage it had taken during the Angel Wars, as most of the battles were outside of the city.  
然而，NERV 再次迎难而上。在一位不愿透露姓名的最高指挥官带领下，NERV 启用了第二代福音战士——共五台，编号从零至四——捍卫人类。于是，亡灵战争正式打响。至今，东京-3 尚未重现天使战争时的惨重损失，多数战事均在城外展开。

What Asuka knew about NERV was that Hikari Horaki was NERV's Public Relations Spokeswoman. No, make that Hikari Suzuhara. Ever since That Incident, Asuka had not spoken to anyone from Tokyo-3.  
明日香得知，NERV 的公关发言人原是光博子，后来变成了光铃原。自那次事件以来，她便与东京-3 的任何人断了联系。

Asuka looked at her watch. Maybe she had been working too hard. Grudgingly, she admitted that Kitamura was right. Maybe she badly needed some rest. She could always come in the day after.  
明日香瞥了一眼手表。看来她确实过于劳累了。她虽不情愿，但不得不承认北村言之有理。她确实急需休息。不如后天再来上班。

Since the United Nations' main headquarters was in Tokyo-2, the U.N. owned several buildings. Buildings in which housed soldiers and commissioned officers. Since Asuka was part of the latter, she had her own one-bedroom apartment. Asuka could have requested a two-bedroom apartment, given that she had a daughter, but decided against it.  
联合国的主要总部位于东京-2，因此拥有多栋建筑，其中驻扎着士兵和委任军官。作为委任军官的一员，明日香拥有自己的单卧室公寓。尽管她有一个女儿，本可以申请更大的两居室公寓，但她最终决定不更换。

The apartment was borderline Spartan, yet furnished, save for the occasional picture of herself, her estranged husband and her daughter, consisting of six rooms – the living room, the kitchen, the bedroom, and two closets. To Asuka, it was small, compact yet efficient.  
这套公寓简洁得近乎斯巴达风格，家具一应俱全，只是偶尔会挂上她、她疏远的丈夫以及女儿的照片，共有六个房间——包括客厅、厨房、卧室和两个衣橱。对明日香而言，虽然紧凑，但布局合理，功能齐备。

Asuka had a routine upon returning home: shower, cigarette with a glass of bourbon on the rocks, watch a little television, then bed.  
明日香回家后的日常是：先洗澡，接着抽根烟，搭配一杯加冰的波本威士忌，稍作休息看看电视，随后便上床睡觉。

So far, Asuka has completed three of her four tasks. Dressed in a white tanktop and a pair of black track pants with red trim, she was stretched out on her sofa, the cigarette burning out in the ashtray, the TV showing the 10 O'clock newscast as she nursed her glass of bourbon.  
截至目前，明日香已完成了四项任务中的三项。她身着白色背心搭配黑色运动裤，裤脚饰以红色条纹，慵懒地躺在沙发上，烟灰缸中的香烟缓缓燃尽，电视正播放着晚间 10 点新闻，她手中轻握着一杯波旁威士忌。

So far, nothing was of interest. Not even from Tokyo-3, where the Revanant Wars was starting to intensify. However, the Revanants were not attacking, and hadn't been for the past two days. Shin Shikinami was stationed at the Geofront, working on the Evangelion project. He also had custody of their five-year-old daughter. Asuka did worry for her daughter, but her pride had absolutely refused to accompany him and Kei to Tokyo-3. She tried to insist it was a personal reason, and that was true, though she swore she'd not tell him exactly why.  
至今为止，没有任何事情引起关注。即便是东京-3，那里的幽灵战争局势正逐渐升温。但幽灵们并未发动攻击，这种情况已持续两天。新·式波驻守在地下空洞，投身于福音战士项目。他还负责照看他们五岁的女儿。明日香虽对女儿心存忧虑，但她的自尊心坚决拒绝与他和凯一同前往东京-3。她坚称这是个人原因，确实如此，但她发誓不会透露具体缘由。

It was still a sore subject for Asuka, even after fifteen years, seeing as how she had left Tokyo-3 in disgrace. It had haunted her more than she'd like to admit, which made it all the more painful.  
即便过去了十五年，这件事对明日香而言依旧是个痛点，毕竟她当年是带着耻辱离开第三新东京市的。这份困扰，她虽不愿多提，却愈发令她感到痛苦。

"Some might have wondered if my name should have been Mata Hari instead of Asuka," she said in dark humor. "Especially in the wake of how I'd left."  
或许有人会想，我的名字该是玛塔·哈丽而非明日香，"她带着一丝自嘲的幽默说，"尤其是在我那样离开之后。

Yawning, Asuka flipped the TV off and downed the last of her bourbon. Maybe a good night's sleep would do some good. Then she could call Kei and wish her a wish her a Merry Christmas. Rising to her feet, she stretched, working the kinks out of her muscles before walking down the hallway towards her bedroom.  
明日香打着哈欠，关掉电视，喝完最后一口波旁酒。或许好好睡一晚能有所改善。之后她可以给惠打电话，送上圣诞祝福。她站起身，伸展身体，缓解肌肉的僵硬，随后沿着走廊走向卧室。

"Momma! Momma! They chose me!"  
妈妈！妈妈！我被选中了！

Asuka stumbled in the hallway, holding her head, as if she was experiencing the mother of all migraines.  
明日香在走廊中步履蹒跚，双手抱头，似乎正遭受着前所未有的剧烈偏头痛。

"I'm gonna be an EVA Pilot! I'm gonna be number one, Momma!"  
我要成为 EVA 驾驶员了！我要当第一名，妈妈！

Asuka was muttering to herself, as she tried to get herself under control. This memory she remembered all too well. She was only five years old when she found her mother's body hanging from the rafters, having killed herself on Christmas Eve.  
明日香低声自语，努力平复情绪。那段记忆她刻骨铭心。五岁那年，圣诞前夜，她发现了悬吊在房梁上的母亲遗体，母亲选择了在那个夜晚结束生命。

After a moment, Asuka had managed to get her emotions under control. This was one of the reasons why she would rather be at work on Christmas Eve, in order to bury herself in her work so she wouldn't have to remember this night. When a little girl lost her Momma on what should have been one of the happier days of the year.  
片刻后，明日香终于平复了情绪。她之所以选择在圣诞前夜工作，就是为了让自己沉浸在工作中，从而忘却这个夜晚。就在一年中本应最快乐的时刻，一个小女孩失去了她的母亲。

Too bad that fate had other plans for the woman formerly known as Asuka Langley Sohryuu, as she was in for one hell of a night.  
可惜命运对这位昔日名为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的女子另有打算，她将经历一个惊心动魄的夜晚。

'Damn bourbon. Think I drunk too much,' she thought darkly as she resumed her pace.  
"这波旁酒真要命，我怕是喝过头了。" 她心中暗想，随即加快了步伐。

It was when she opened the door to her room, her worst nightmares had manifested itself in the form of her mother's body, hanging from the ceiling, the same way that Asuka remembered all those years ago.  
当她推开房门，最可怕的噩梦成真——母亲的尸体悬挂在天花板上，一如多年前明日香记忆中的情景。

Asuka screamed as she stumbled backwards, falling on her rear. She squeezed her eyes shut. "It's not real...it's not real...get a grip, Asuka. She's dead. Has been for over twenty years," she whispered.  
明日香尖叫着向后跌去，摔坐在地上。她紧闭双眼，低声自语：“这不是真的...不是真的...要振作，明日香。她已经去世二十多年了。”

"Why do you deny what your eyes see?"  
为何要否认亲眼所见呢？

Asuka opened her eyes. Sure enough, her mother was still there. Only this time, she was not hanging from the rafters, she was standing before her. Skin pale as death, the hair limp, the eyes as empty as she remembered.  
明日香睁开双眼，果不其然，母亲依旧在那里。这次不同，她并未悬挂在梁上，而是站在自己面前。肤色苍白如死，发丝无力垂落，眼神空洞，一如记忆中的模样。

Asuka began to scramble backwards, hitting the wall. "Momma...no...impossible..."  
明日香惊慌地向后退，直到撞上墙壁。“妈妈...不...这不可能...”

Kyokou Zeppelin Sohryuu looked down at her daughter. "No, Asuka. It's me," she said.  
京极齐柏林飞艇苍龙俯视着女儿，说道：“不，飞鸟，是我。”

"What...what do you want from me?" Asuka whimpered.  
"你...你究竟想从我这里得到什么？" 明日香哽咽道。

"I don't have much time, Asuka," Kyokou replied, "but I am here to warn you. Your arrogance and pride will lead to your downfall. The same as it has done with me."  
明日香，我时间不多，" 京极回应说，"但我来是为了提醒你。你的傲慢和自负终将招致你的失败，正如我曾经的遭遇。

Seeing as how she held Asuka's attention, Kyokou continued. "I worked alongside Yui Ikari on the Evangelion Program. The EVAs themselves were cloned from the DNA of ADAM and Lilith. But the first-generation EVAs had a critical flaw."  
她吸引了明日香的注意，于是京极继续说：“我曾与碇唯合作，共同推进 Evangelion 计划。这些 EVA 机体源自亚当和莉莉丝的 DNA 克隆。然而，第一代 EVA 有一个严重的缺陷。”

"The cores..." 这些核心...

Kyokou nodded. "The cores of the first-generation Evangelions were not the Super Solenoid cores seen in the Angels. The cores required a human soul for it to work. Yui was absorbed into Unit One, while the maternal part of my psyche was absorbed into Unit Two. With the destruction of Unit Two, my soul was restored."  
京极点头表示：“第一代福音战士的核心并非天使所用的超级螺线管核心，而是需要人类灵魂才能启动。唯被初号机吸收，我心灵中的母性部分则被二号机吸收。二号机被毁后，我的灵魂得以复原。”

Asuka snorted. "I think the bourbon was bad," she muttered. "I'm being visited by my dead mother."  
明日香哼了一声，低声道：“那波旁酒怕是坏了，我居然梦见了我已故的母亲。”

With a growl, Kyokou reached down and grabbed Asuka by the throat. Lifting her off her ass and into the air, pinning her against the wall, her hand cold as death itself, her eyes burning a hole into Asuka's azure orbs, which had a terrified look to them.  
京极低吼一声，猛地抓住飞鸟的脖子，将她从地上拽起，紧贴墙面。他的手冰冷彻骨，目光炽烈，仿佛要穿透飞鸟那双充满恐惧的蔚蓝眼睛。

"Verdammt, Asuka! Des ist nicht Spiel! (Damn it, Asuka! This is not a game!)" Kyokou shouted, addressing her daughter in German. "Wollen Sie als verutelite Seele fur alle Ewigkeit, wie mir wandern?(Your life is at stake! Do you want to wander as a condemned soul for all eternity, like me?)"  
该死，明日香！这不是儿戏！（Damn it, Asuka! This is not a game!）"京子用德语对女儿吼道。"你难道想像我一样，作为被诅咒的灵魂，永远在世间徘徊吗？（Your life is at stake! Do you want to wander as a condemned soul for all eternity, like me?）

Kyokou then dropped her daughter to the floor, where Asuka landed in an undignified and shocked heap on the hardwood floor. "You were always too arrogant for your own good. I can only hope that the Angels will show you the error of your ways."  
京极随后将女儿摔落在地，飞鸟狼狈不堪地跌坐在硬木地板上，一脸震惊。“你一向自视过高，愿天使们能让你明白自己的过失。”

Asuka blinked. "Angels?" 明日香眨眼道：“天使？”

"Yes, Angels. You will be visited by three of them. Expect the first to arrive at 1 a.m.," Kyokou said sharply. "This is not negotiable, Asuka. Listen to them, and learn from your mistakes...or you will be here with me...condemned forever. Don't disappoint me, Asuka."  
是的，天使们。你将会迎来三位天使的拜访。预计第一位将在凌晨 1 点抵达，"京极语气坚决地说。"此事不容商量，明日香。你要聆听他们的话，从错误中吸取教训……否则，你将和我一样，永远受罚。别让我失望，明日香。

Asuka woke up with a start. She was still in the living room, the cigarette having burned itself out, the glass of bourbon watered down, the ice having melted.  
明日香突然惊醒，发现自己还躺在客厅里。香烟已经燃尽，波本威士忌被融化的冰块稀释了。

The T.V. was playing late-night programming – a music video show. Asuka picked up the remote and cut it off. Retrieving the glass, she took it into the kitchen and dumped its contents into the sink, leaving the glass there.  
电视正播放着深夜的音乐视频秀。Asuka 拿起遥控器关掉了电视。她端着杯子走进厨房，将杯中物倒入水槽，随后将杯子搁置一旁。

'Need to sleep this off,' she thought as she stepped into the bedroom. Slipping under the covers, Asuka Shikinami fell fast asleep.  
她心想：“得睡一觉来缓解一下。”走进卧室，钻进被窝的明日香·式波不久便沉沉入睡。

But it would not last long. Ms. Asuka Shikinami's Wild Ride was about to begin...and who knew where it would end or how she'd end up.  
然而，这番景象并不会持续太久。明日香·式波的惊险之旅即将拉开序幕...无人知晓这场冒险的终点在何方，她又将面临怎样的结局。
