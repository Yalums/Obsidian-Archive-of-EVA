Just a Couple of Angels  
只是两位天使

By Kraken's Ghost 作者：海妖之魂

---
"Come on, Wonder Girl, I can't take this anymore."  
"快点，神奇女孩，我再也受不了了。"

"We're almost there. My apartment is in the next building."  
"我们快到了。我的公寓就在隔壁那栋楼。"

"About time!" "终于要到了！"

Ayanami Rei was attempting to walk calmly up the street that led to her apartment. Of course, _intent_ can be vastly different than result. Her fellow Eva pilot had other ideas. Langley Asuka practically shoved Rei non-stop. The girl's trademark impatience showed quite obviously. She was also plainly excited, though she tried to cover it up with feigned anger.  
绫波零正试图平静地走在通往她公寓的街道上。当然，意图与结果往往大相径庭。她的同僚 EVA 驾驶员有别的打算。惣流·明日香·兰格雷不停地推搡着零。女孩标志性的急躁显而易见。她也很明显地兴奋着，尽管她试图用假装生气的样子来掩饰。

Asuka apparently hadn't heard Rei as she said, "Hurry up! You promised, in case you forgot! (Not like she'd have the chance, knowing Asuka...) At the very least you can stop being such a slowpoke."  
明日香显然没听到零说的话，她催促道：“快点！你答应过的，别告诉我你忘了！（有明日香在，她也没机会忘...）至少你可以别这么慢吞吞的。”

"..."

"I swear, its no wonder I'm the best Eva pilot in this stupid town... rant... best skill out of the lot... rave... most beautiful and intelligent... rant... constantly aware of my surroundings... rave... ready at a moment's notice..."  
"我发誓，难怪我是这个破城里最棒的 Eva 驾驶员...抱怨...一堆人里最厉害的技能...狂赞...最美最聪明...抱怨...时刻警惕周围...狂赞...随时准备行动..."

It took the "best pilot" a few minutes for her to realize that the footsteps beside her had ceased. Asuka turned her head around and noticed that Rei was standing at the entrance to an apartment building...  
这位“最佳驾驶员”花了好几分钟才意识到身边的脚步声已经停止。明日香转过头，注意到绫波站在一栋公寓楼的入口处...

...almost a block and a half back down the street.  
...几乎退回到街道上一个半街区远的地方。

The quiet girl was staring at her. Asuka could have sworn she heard a "Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you the Best Eva Pilot in the world!" echo somewhere nearby. Her face changed to the same shade of red as her plug suit and she walk-ran to her companion with as much dignity as she could muster. Rei didn't say a single word; she only stared at her for a few seconds, then twisted the knob and entered the building.  
那个安静的女孩正盯着她看。明日香几乎可以发誓她听到了“女士们先生们，让我们向您介绍世界上最优秀的 EVA 驾驶员！”的回声在附近响起。她的脸变得和她驾驶服一样红，她尽可能保持尊严地快步走向她的同伴。绫波没有说一句话；她只是盯着她几秒钟，然后扭动门把手走进了建筑物。

The hallway was empty, not really surprising. Asuka forgot her embarrassment as she followed Rei to the elevators. The purple haired girl pressed the call button and waited patiently. The other girl however, got bored fairly rapidly and nearly broke her neck as she craned it to look all over the place.  
走廊空无一人，并不令人意外。明日香忘记了她的尴尬，跟着绫波走向电梯。紫发的女孩按下呼叫按钮，耐心等待。然而，另一个女孩很快就感到无聊，几乎扭断了脖子，因为她伸长脖子四处张望。

Rei watched the light move from the fourth floor, to the third, to the-  
绫波看着灯光从四楼移动到三楼，再到——

"What the hell is taking that stupid thing so long!"  
"那该死的东西怎么这么慢！"

The silence was shattered by a certain red-haired pilot. If Rei did not have nerves of titanium (Much stronger and lighter than that wussy alloy steel.) she would have flinched. Instead, she ignored her comp-  
一阵沉默被某位红发飞行员打破。如果丽不是有着钛合金般的神经（比那种软弱的合金钢强得多也轻得多），她早就吓得一哆嗦了。然而，她选择无视她的同伴——

"%@$#&#*@$$!! (God only knows what that means.) That thing takes forever!"  
"%@$#&#*@$!!（天知道那是什么意思。）那东西慢得要命！"

The most unusual thing happened; Rei's eye twitched. At any other moment, (Yes, even if an Angel had attacked.) Asuka would have hailed it as an omen of the Anti-Christ but in her current agitated state, she didn't notice.  
最不寻常的事情发生了；丽的眼皮跳了一下。在任何其他时刻，（是的，即使天使已经攻击了。）明日香可能会将其视为反基督的预兆，但在她目前烦躁的状态下，她并未注意到。

"You piece of shit! Hurry the *--- up!!"  
“你这混蛋！快点*---！！”

Mercifully for the purple haired girl, at that moment the elevator doors opened. Rei stepped inside and Asuka, smirking triumphantly (she taught that elevator a thing or two!), followed. As the elevator door shut, the last visible sight was Rei's eye twitching yet again.  
幸运的是，就在那一刻电梯门打开了。丽走进去，明日香得意地笑着（她给那电梯上了一课！），紧随其后。随着电梯门关闭，最后可见的是丽的眼皮再次跳动。

***

The small apartment was dark and cool as the two Eva pilots stepped into it. Rei flicked the light and walked down the small hall. Asuka curiously looked around and followed her purple haired companion.  
两人走进这间狭小的公寓，里面昏暗而凉爽。绫波轻触开关，走过狭窄的走廊。明日香好奇地环顾四周，跟随在她紫发的同伴身后。

"Well?" “嗯？”

Rei turned around to look at Asuka.  
绫波转过身来看着明日香。

"What is the problem?"  
“有什么问题吗？”

"Aren't you going to give me a tour of this place yet."  
"你还不打算带我参观一下这个地方吗？"

Asuka feigned a person of regal and high importance, drawing herself up and making a few haughty gestures with her hands.  
明日香装出一副高贵而重要的人物模样，挺直身板，用手做了几个傲慢的手势。

"You know, the polite thing to do when you have a guest over is to show them around your place."  
"你知道，有客人来访时，礼貌的做法是带他们参观你的住处。"

Rei blinked and looked at her girlfriend for a moment. Then she pointed in one direction,  
丽眨了眨眼，看向她的女朋友片刻。然后她指向一个方向，

"There is the kitchen."  
“那边是厨房。”

She pointed in another,  
她又指向另一个方向，

"The bathroom. This is my bed."  
“浴室。这是我的床。”

Asuka's impersonation of British royalty deflated like a balloon in a porcupine farm. She stared blankly at the purple haired pilot, wondering how she could have made it this far with the dialogue of an ATM machine.  
明日香模仿英国王室的表演像豪猪农场的气球一样泄了气。她茫然地盯着那位紫发飞行员，疑惑自己是怎么凭借 ATM 机般的对话走到这一步的。

"Great tour, Wonder Girl. Superb delivery. The Smithsonian is gonna break into the Commander's office tomorrow demanding that he let you come work for them. Your career as a tour guide will be glorious."  
“精彩的导览，奇迹少女。绝佳的讲解。史密森尼学会明天就要闯进指挥官的办公室，要求他让你去为他们工作。你作为导游的职业生涯将会辉煌无比。”

Rei thought for a moment, then replied.  
丽想了一会儿，然后回答道。

"I don't understand." “我不明白。”

A certain vein in a certain forehead of a certain red-headed pilot began to throb wildly and threatened to explode violently at any moment.  
某位红发飞行员额头上的一根青筋开始剧烈跳动，随时都有可能猛烈爆裂。

'Deep breaths, Asuka. Don't let her attitude get to you. Calm down...'  
'深呼吸，明日香。别让她态度影响到你。冷静下来...'

"Langley, why is a vein enlarging in you forehead?"  
"兰格雷，为什么你额头上的血管在膨胀？"

Only a _very_ strong set of nerves saved a certain purple haired girl from being hurled out a certain window and a certain pilot from being sent to prison.  
只有非常强大的神经才能阻止某个紫发女孩被扔出某个窗户，以及某个驾驶员被送进监狱。

"Never mind. Forget about it."  
“没关系，别在意。”

Asuka walked over to the bed and flopped down on it. Rei watched her a moment longer, then quietly sat down next to her. The other girl took in the sight of the room. She noticed the bareness of it and the lack of personal effects.  
明日香走到床边，扑通一声躺下。绫波看了她一会儿，然后静静地坐在她旁边。另一个女孩环顾房间，注意到了它的空旷和缺乏个人物品。

'Why am I not surprised.'  
“我为什么一点儿也不惊讶呢。”

The two pilots continued to sit there for awhile, each mulling in her own thoughts. That is, until it occurred to Asuka that she was here. With Rei. Her girlfriend.  
两位驾驶员继续在那里坐了一会儿，各自沉浸在自己的思绪中。直到明日香突然意识到，她在这里。和绫波。她的女朋友。

Alone. 单独。

No perverted Ikari. No drunken Misato. No Hell-Bent-On-World-Annihilation-Angels (Join the movement! HBOWAA now has a home address at... Oh yeah, you're human. Never mind.)  
没有变态的真嗣。没有醉酒的美里。没有一心毁灭世界的使徒（加入我们的运动！HBOWAA 现在有了一个家庭地址……哦对了，你是人类。算了。）

Just her and Rei.  
只有她和丽。

...On a bed. ...在床上。

Asuka got a an evil grin on her face. She turned to Rei and leaned towards her. Just as her lips were about to encounter a white ear, however, her purple haired companion stood up and walked to the kitchen.  
明日香脸上露出了一个邪恶的笑容。她转向丽，身体前倾。就在她的嘴唇即将碰到那只白色的耳朵时，然而，她那紫发的同伴站了起来，走向了厨房。

Asuka had a second to realize she was completely off balance before she fell clean off the bed and smashed her face into the floor. She grabbed her aching features and grimaced, hoping she hadn't broken her nose.  
明日香只有一瞬间意识到自己完全失去了平衡，紧接着就干净利落地从床上摔了下来，脸重重地砸在了地板上。她捂着疼痛的部位，皱起了眉头，希望自己的鼻子没有摔断。

'Dammit, Wonder Girl! Off all the times you had to be spontaneous!'  
'该死，神奇少女！你非得在所有时候都这么即兴吗！'

At that moment, Rei came back into the room. She eyed the wounded German a moment before speaking.  
就在这时，丽回到了房间。她打量了受伤的德国女孩一会儿，然后开口说道。

"Does rice and noodles sound good?"  
"米饭和面条听起来怎么样？"

Through her fingers, Asuka tried her best not to cuss the out other girl in German. She was pretty sure she could smell again, so the odds were in her favor that she hadn't broken her nose. In a tight, controlled voice and through gritted teeth, she replied,  
透过指缝，明日香尽力用德语克制住对另一个女孩的咒骂。她相当确定自己又能闻到气味了，所以她没弄断鼻子的几率很大。她紧咬牙关，用一种紧绷而克制的声音回答道，

"Noodles. And. Rice. Would. Be. Fine."  
"面条。和。米饭。会。很。好。"

Rei continued to look at her for a minute or so.  
丽继续盯着她看了一分钟左右。

"What. Is. It. Wonder Girl?"  
“什、么、事，小奇？”

"...Langley, is something wrong with your nose?"  
“……兰利，你的鼻子有什么问题吗？”

The entire building was filled was filled by a sharp scream.  
整栋建筑内回荡着一声尖锐的尖叫。

***

Asuka stared at her plate, occasionally sticking some noodles in her mouth. Rei sat across the table from her, eating slightly faster but not at a really impressive speed. Neither had spoken a word since the landlord and police had knocked on the door, asking if they knew anything about a reported homicide.  
明日香盯着她的盘子，偶尔挑起几根面条送入口中。丽坐在桌子对面，吃得不慢，但速度并不惊人。自从房东和警察敲门询问他们是否知道一起报告的谋杀案后，两人都未曾开口。

Asuka leaned on one hand, playing with her food as she thought.  
明日香单手撑着头，一边思考一边摆弄着食物。

'Maybe I shouldn't have screamed... at least not so loud. I wonder if she's mad at me.'  
'也许我不该尖叫...至少不该那么大声。不知道她是不是生我气了。'

She glanced up at Rei and immediately back down. The other girl didn't notice.  
她抬头瞥了一眼丽，随即又低下头去。另一个女孩没有注意到。

'She's not saying anything. She's mad. Idiot, she never says anything! She could be giddy for all you know.'  
'她什么都没说。她生气了。笨蛋，她从来都不说话的！你根本不知道她是不是高兴得不得了。'

Once again, Asuka looked at Rei. Her dinner companion's gaze was focused on her own plate. She quietly, mechanically almost, continued to eat.  
又一次，明日香看向绫波。她的晚餐同伴目光集中在自己的盘子上。她几乎悄无声息地，机械般地继续进食。

Asuka's normally hard and sharp eyes softened slightly as she looked at the purple haired pilot across the table from her.  
明日香平时坚硬锐利的眼神在看向对面桌上的紫发驾驶员时稍微柔和了一些。

'Damn, she's beautiful. Wonder Girl is the hottest... or coldest... thing I've ever laid eyes on. And she doesn't know it! She has no idea what she does to me.'  
'该死，她真美。绫波是我见过的最火辣...或者说最冷艳...的存在。而她对此一无所知！她根本不知道她对我产生了什么影响。'

Rei, oblivious to Asuka's ponderings, continued to consume her meal. The red-head glanced back down at her noodles and rice.  
丽对明日香的心思浑然不觉，继续享用她的餐点。红发少女再次低头看向她的面条和米饭。

'And she went through the trouble of cooking for you and you sit here playing with it. Great way to show gratitude, Asuka.'  
'她还特意为你做饭，你却坐在这里玩弄食物。真是表达感激的好方法，明日香。'

The other girl was surprised to see her girlfriend get a sudden burst of energy and to begin packing away all of her food in mere seconds. Red eyes blinked, stared, and blinked again.  
另一个女孩惊讶地看到她的女朋友突然充满活力，几秒钟内就把所有食物打包好了。红眼睛眨了眨，盯着，又眨了眨。

"..."

"Grp upl, gualp." "咕噜咕噜，咕噜。"

"...Do you like the meal?"  
"...你喜欢这顿饭吗？"

Asuka looked up, a rogue noodle hanging from her mouth and rice on her chin.  
明日香抬头，一根顽皮的面条挂在嘴边，下巴上还沾着饭粒。

"...Mrmfrt... -Gulp- Its great!"  
"...呣呣呣... -咕噜- 太好吃了！"

Rei blinked once again. There were times when she believed she was destined to never understand some things...  
绫波再次眨了眨眼。有些事情，她总觉得注定永远无法理解...

"-Loud chewing and swallowing-"  
"-大声咀嚼和吞咽-"

...and some people, in this world.  
...以及这个世界上的一些人。

***

Later, Asuka stretched out on the bed as she listened to Rei cleaning up the dishes. The pilot would have helped her, except she had a slight problem. She could barely move.  
后来，明日香躺在床上，听着丽清洗碗碟的声音。这位飞行员本想帮忙，只是她有个小问题。她几乎动弹不得。

'Damn, I really shouldn't have eaten so much. But, if it made Rei happy, it was worth it.'  
'该死，我真的不该吃那么多。但，如果这让丽开心了，那就值了。'

The sounds of water running stopped and a few moments later, the purple haired Wonder Girl stepped into the living room.  
水流声停止了，片刻后，紫发的神奇少女走进了客厅。

'How the hell does she do that! She always moves whenever I think about her! ...Oh well, I wonder if she's still mad...'  
'她到底是怎么做到的！每次我想她的时候她都会动！...算了，不知道她还在不在生气...'

Asuka looked at Rei's face. The same indifferent expression looked back at her.  
明日香看着绫波的脸。同样的冷漠表情回望着她。

'I give up. I don't have a damn clue if she's enraged, happy, or homicidal.'  
'我放弃了。我完全搞不懂她是生气、高兴还是想杀人。'

Just then, much to the German's surprise, Rei's expression became peculiar. Her red eyes narrowed slightly and she walked towards Asuka. She stopped right in front of her and leaned over other girl.  
就在这时，令德国人惊讶的是，绫波的表情变得古怪起来。她的红眼睛微微眯起，向明日香走去。她停在明日香面前，俯身靠近她。

'Hey! Now this is more like it! I wonder if she'll...'  
'嘿！这才像样嘛！不知道她会不会……'

"Langley?" "兰格利？"

Asuka repressed smug grin.  
明日香压下了得意的微笑。

"Yes, Wonder Girl?" "是的，神奇女孩？"

Rei leaned closer, until the other pilot could feel her breath on her mouth.  
丽靠得更近了，直到另一位飞行员能感觉到她的呼吸拂过嘴唇。

"You..." "你……"

Asuka put a coy and expectant look in her eyes.  
明日香眼中闪过一丝羞涩与期待。

"Yes?" “嗯？”

"You..." “你……”

Red eyes narrowed a little further. Rei reached with one hand to touch Asuka's chin.  
红眸微微眯得更细。丽伸出一只手，轻触明日香的下巴。

'Come on, Wonder Girl! Hurry it up!'  
“快点，奇迹少女！加快速度！”

"You... have rice on your chin."  
“你……下巴上有饭粒。”

The purple haired girl wiped it away with her thumb and stood up straight. Asuka's face took on an indescribable look.  
紫发女孩用拇指擦去泪水，挺直了身子。明日香的脸色变得难以言喻。

"Langley, that vein's back..."  
“兰格雷，那根青筋又出现了……”

***

An hour later, Asuka had calmed down to the point where she was no longer in danger of a stroke. And it was fairly certain that she was no longer planning ways to disembowel her purple haired companion. Rei still sat on the far side of the bed from her. Judging from the way the red head's hand still twitched oddly every few minutes, that was probably a good idea.  
一个小时后，明日香的情绪平复到不再有中风危险的地步。可以确定的是，她也不再计划如何肢解她的紫发同伴。绫波仍然坐在床的另一边。从红发女孩的手每隔几分钟就奇怪地抽搐来看，这或许是个明智之举。

Asuka, meanwhile, was pondering the fact that Rei's apartment had no real decorations in it. The bloody bandages didn't count.  
与此同时，明日香正在思考一个事实：绫波的公寓里没有任何真正的装饰品。那些血迹斑斑的绷带不算。

She glanced at Rei.  
她瞥了一眼绫波。

"Hey Wonder Girl, where's your TV?"  
“嘿，奇迹少女，你的电视呢？”

"I don't have one."  
“我没有。”

"Oh." “哦。”

She had no idea what there was to do here. She wasn't pissed off anymore. Needless to say, without anger, she couldn't plot someone's untimely demise. And when she wasn't figuring out how to eviscerate through a school shirt with only a penknife, she got bored very quickly.  
她完全不知道在这里能做什么。她已经不再生气了。不用说，没有愤怒，她无法策划某人的意外死亡。而当她不在琢磨如何用一把小折刀刺穿校服衬衫时，她很快就感到无聊了。

And to make matters worse, all her attempts to flirt with the cold girl next her had so far backfired and wound up with some part of her body in pain. Her nose was still tender and her gut ached.  
更糟糕的是，她试图与身旁那位冷冰冰的女孩调情的所有尝试迄今为止都适得其反，结果是她的某个部位疼痛不已。她的鼻子仍然酸痛，腹部也还在隐隐作痛。

"Langley?" "兰利？"

Asuka sighed, muttered something about psychic, purple haired, red eyed Eva pilots plotting against her, then replied,  
明日香叹了口气，低声抱怨着关于心灵感应、紫发红眼的 EVA 驾驶员们密谋对付她的事情，然后回应道，

"Yeah, Wonder Girl?" "嗯，小华？"

"...You don't like my home?"  
"...你不喜欢我的家吗？"

Asuka turned to her. Rei had her head cocked in a curious fashion.  
明日香转过身来。绫波歪着头，带着好奇的神情。

"What makes you say that?"  
"你为什么这么说？"

"Several things. You screamed earlier and your forehead seems to be under extreme pressure. That implies stress of the environment. You're also gripping your abdomen which suggests that the meal isn't being digested in your stomach, therefore suggesting bad food. And you don't seem to be enjoying my company this evening, all of which have brought me to the conclusion that you don't like being here."  
几件事。你之前尖叫了，而且你的额头似乎承受着极大的压力。这意味着环境带来的压力。你还紧抓着腹部，这表明食物在你的胃里没有被消化，因此暗示了食物有问题。而且你今晚似乎并不享受我的陪伴，所有这些都让我得出结论，你不喜欢待在这里。

Asuka stared at her blankly for a few minutes. Literally, for a few minutes. She had never, _never_ heard Rei speak so much in a single day, sometimes even a whole week, even after they started dating.  
明日香愣愣地盯着她看了几分钟。真的，足足几分钟。她从未，从未见过绫波一天内说这么多话，有时甚至是一整周，即便是在她们开始交往之后。

Rei... speaking a paragraph... but still impersonating an ATM machine...  
绫波...说了一段话...但仍然像个自动提款机一样...

...Creepy... ...真吓人...

But her intentions were good, despite the shivers down her spine.  
尽管脊背发凉，但她的意图是好的。

'I've been screwing up the whole day long and making an ass of myself. And she thinks she's been doing something wrong. Of all the...'  
'我一整天都在搞砸事情，让自己出尽洋相。而她却觉得自己做错了什么。真是的...'

Finally, Rei asked her,  
终于，丽问她，

"Langley?" “兰格雷？”

"Rei, I've told you before to call me Asuka."  
“丽，我之前就告诉过你，叫我明日香。”

"...Alright, As-" "...好吧，阿斯-"

A certain red head crossed a certain bed at an unbelievable velocity to plant a big kiss on a certain purple haired pilot's mouth.  
某个红发人以不可思议的速度穿过某张床，给了某个紫发飞行员一个深深的吻。

'Should've done this right off the bat.'  
'早该一开始就这么做了。'

When Asuka broke it off, she smugly noted that she had been able to finally surprise the other girl. For the first time, the German saw a shocked look on her fellow pilots face. With a grin that got _much_ luckier than the others, she leaned over Rei to whisper,  
当明日香提出分手时，她得意地注意到自己终于让对方感到了惊讶。这是第一次，这位德国女孩在她的同伴脸上看到了震惊的表情。她带着比平时更为幸运的笑容，俯身靠近绫波，低声说道，

"Why don't you give me a tour of your-"  
“不如你带我参观一下你的——”

The phone rang. Damn, not so lucky.  
电话铃响了。该死，没那么幸运。

Still wide eyed, Rei reached over to answer it.  
依旧瞪大眼睛，丽伸手去接电话。

"Yes? Yes... Alright." “喂？是的……好的。”

She hung it up. Asuka looked at her questioningly.  
她挂断了电话。明日香疑惑地看着她。

"That was the Captain. An Angel has been spotted off the coast."  
那是舰长。海岸附近发现了一只使徒。

The room was filled with vulgarities in German. The German immigrants in the next door apartment crossed themselves and covered their children's ears. When Asuka finally stopped cussing, she got a _very_ dangerous look in her eye.  
房间里充斥着德语的粗话。隔壁的德国移民们画着十字，捂住了孩子们的耳朵。当明日香终于停止咒骂时，她的眼中闪现出极其危险的光芒。

"Alright, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go play Eva pilot and I'm gonna rip that Angel a few new holes. Then, you and I are coming back here to screw each other's brains out. Ok?"  
“好，我们这么办。我们去驾驶 EVA，我要给那使徒开几个新洞。然后，你和我回来这里，把对方的脑子都搞糊涂。好吗？”

Rei stared at her blankly. The Anti-Christ must be coming home for dinner because for the third time that day, the flesh around her eye twitched.  
丽盯着她，眼神空洞。反基督者一定是要回家吃晚饭了，因为那天她的眼周肌肉第三次抽搐起来。

***

The Angel was hiding. Yes, the giant creature that had attempted to destroy everything in sight was now cowering behind the remains of a skyscraper. Never had it or any of the other Angels come across anything so vicious... so sadistic... so...  
天使在躲藏。是的，那个曾试图摧毁一切的巨型生物，现在正蜷缩在一座摩天大楼的废墟后面。无论是它还是其他天使，都从未遇到过如此凶残...如此变态...如此...

...**_Evil_**.  ...邪恶的东西。

It's heart (Or equivalent cardiovascular system.) nearly stopped as it heard a footstep nearby. Suddenly, it wished it had not come to Earth, or this solar system. Alpha Centura was nice this time of year, but noooo... had to play the big shot. Come to Earth, mess up a few Eva's, burn down a couple of cities, have a lot of laughs...  
它的心脏（或等效的循环系统）几乎停止了跳动，因为它听到了附近的脚步声。突然，它希望自己没有来到地球，或者这个太阳系。阿尔法·半人马星在这个时节很美，但偏偏要逞英雄。来到地球，搞砸几台 EVA，烧毁几座城市，笑个不停……

It nearly wet itself as it definitely heard something nearby.  
它几乎要吓尿了，因为它确实听到了附近有什么动静。

"Here Angel, Angel, Angel... Come on out. I'm not going to maul, maim or otherwise render all 12 of your limbs from your body. Really. Scouts honor. So, come on out. I'm asking nicely..."  
“来吧，天使，天使，天使……出来吧。我不会把你撕碎、弄残，或者把你的 12 条肢体都卸下来。真的。童子军誓言。所以，出来吧。我可是很客气地在请求呢……”

The strangely accented voice floated over a loudspeaker. To the Angel (who can't understand Japanese) it seemed to hold the promise of horrors beyond all compare.  
那带有奇怪口音的声音通过扩音器飘荡开来。对于那位不懂日语的天使来说，这声音似乎预示着超乎想象的恐怖。

The giant creature realized it had two choices; one, run like hell and take a very long vacation at Alpha Centura or two, stay here with...**IT**...  
巨型生物意识到它有两个选择；一是拼命逃跑，去半人马座阿尔法星享受一个漫长的假期，二是留在这里与...它...共处。

An _extremely_ light sound came from a block down the road. An alley cat had knocked over a trash can.  
从街角传来一声极轻的声响。一只巷子里的猫碰翻了垃圾桶。

Instantly, the entire city block was lit up with explosions as the entire landscape eroded away under the gunfire. Thirty seconds and a really big hole in the ground later, the voice came over the loudspeaker again.  
顷刻间，整个街区被爆炸点亮，枪林弹雨下，地貌迅速消蚀。三十秒后，地面留下了一个巨大的坑洞，扩音器中再次传来了声音。

"Oops... I'm _so_ sorry."  
“哎呀...真对不起。”

***

"I don't believe it. An Angel... Running?"  
“难以置信。一个使徒...在逃跑？”

"Yeah, I didn't know they could move so fast."  
"是啊，我没想到它们能跑这么快。"

"You think that's fast, look at Asuka. She's right on that thing's tail."  
"你觉得这算快？看看明日香，她紧追在那东西后面。"

"Think she'll catch it?"  
"你觉得她能追上吗？"

"Yeah, I'm pre- Oh my god."  
"是啊，我正要——哦天哪。"

"She... Caught it." "她……接住了。"

"..." "……"

"..."

"I'm gonna be sick."  
"我要吐了。"

"Outta my way!" "让开！"

***

Asuka stormed to the changing room, hauling Rei after her. She had her trademark look on her face. One person, a worker repairing some computers, had gotten in her way. After the ambulance left, (not to mention almost every other living soul that had watched the slaugh-COUGH-...fight) everyone else literally jumped and shoved each other to get out of her path.  
明日香怒气冲冲地走向更衣室，拽着绫波跟在后面。她的脸上挂着标志性的怒容。一个正在修理电脑的工作人员挡了她的路。救护车离开后（更不用说几乎所有目睹了这场屠杀——咳咳，战斗的其他人），其他人几乎都跳起来互相推搡着让开路。

She swung open her locker so hard, Shinji heard from down the hall. He wisely decided to take cover. Inside the room, Asuka turned to Rei.  
她用力拉开自己的储物柜，连走廊另一头的真嗣都听到了声响。他明智地决定找个地方躲起来。在房间里，明日香转向绫波。

"Plug suit off. Clothes on. _Fast_."  
"快脱下插入栓服，换上衣服。"

***

In Hell, Satan was pleasantly surprised. Three Anti-Christ's and counting. At this rate, he could kick God's ass by midnight.  
在地狱，撒旦惊喜不已。三个反基督者，还在增加。照这个速度，午夜前他就能把上帝打得落花流水。

'Let's see that holy pansy beat me now.'  
“看看那圣洁的娘娘腔现在怎么赢我。”

All of a sudden, with an explosion of flame, another one appeared.  
突然间，随着一阵火焰的爆炸，又一个出现了。

"In your face, Pop! You've got one; I have four!"  
"面对你，老爸！你只有一个；我有四个！"

All the denizens of Hell were subject to the bizarre sight of a goat-legged man with a pitchfork slapping his hairy rear to the heavens.  
地狱的所有居民都目睹了这怪异的一幕：一个长着山羊腿、手持干草叉的男人，将他毛茸茸的臀部朝天拍打着。

All four of the Anti-Christs sweat dropped.  
四位反基督者都汗颜了。

***

The door to Rei's apartment had barely been unlocked when it was kicked open. A crazed and sexually frustrated red head stormed into the living room.  
丽公寓的门刚被解锁，就被一脚踹开。一个疯狂且性欲受挫的红发女子冲进了客厅。

"Now then, first things first. No more phone calls!!"  
“现在，首先，不许再打电话了！！”

The phone, its cord, and the connected outlet went through the window like pavement through Firestone tires (...No comment necessary.) Rei looked for a moment at the glass on the floor. She stared at Asuka.  
电话、电话线以及连接的插座像柏油路穿过凡士通轮胎一样飞出窗外（……无需评论。）丽看了一会儿地上的玻璃碎片。她盯着明日香。

"...That was my only phone."  
"...那是我唯一的手机。"

Asuka turned around slowly with the expression of demonically possessed psychopath (...No comment necessary.)  
明日香缓缓转过身来，脸上带着被恶魔附身的精神病患者的表情（...无需评论。）

"Then we'll get you a new one. We don't have NERV credit cards for nothing!"  
"那我们就给你买个新的。我们可不是白白拥有 NERV 信用卡的！"

With the air of a lunatic (...No-... Oh, never mind. I'm going home. -Door Slam-) she whirled around.  
她带着疯子的神气（……不……哦，算了。我要回家了。-门砰地关上-）猛地转身。

"Next on the agenda..."  
“接下来议程上……”

She strode out the front door and over to the elevators. A convenient electrician's tool box with a crowbar inside lay nearby that the author had left behind as a distraction  
她大步走出前门，朝电梯走去。附近有一个电工的工具箱，里面有撬棍，是作者留下的一个干扰物。

From inside the apartment, Rei heard the ding of the elevator, followed by the sound of bending, tearing metal. The button panel made sounds like popping fireworks as the circuit boards gave out.  
从公寓内，丽听到了电梯的叮咚声，紧接着是金属弯曲撕裂的声音。按钮面板发出类似烟花爆裂的声响，电路板纷纷失效。

The silent Eva pilot watched as Asuka walked by the front door then out of sight again as she went to the backup flight of stairs.  
沉默的 EVA 驾驶员看着明日香从前门走过，然后随着她走向备用楼梯，再次消失在视线之外。

It was surprisingly easy for her to jam the door. The hinges weren't all that sturdy.  
对她来说，卡住门意外地容易。那些铰链并不十分坚固。

She came back the entrance of Rei's home. At that moment, the neighbor's door opened. The Germans began screaming something about putrefying their children's minds. Asuka screamed louder and got her point across very rapidly when she waved the crowbar around. The neighbors made a hasty retreat.  
她回到了丽家门口。就在这时，邻居的门开了。德国人开始尖叫着说什么腐蚀他们孩子的心灵。明日香尖叫得更响，当她挥舞着撬棍时，很快就传达了她的意思。邻居们匆忙撤退。

The crowbar was disposed of, over the side of the railing, and the red head strode back into the room and slammed the door. She turned all the locks.  
撬棍被扔到了栏杆外，红发女孩大步走回房间，砰地一声关上门。她把所有的锁都转了一遍。

"No more cops or idiot landlords!"  
“再也不要警察或白痴房东了！”

She returned to the room.  
她回到了房间。

"And last but not least..."  
“最后但同样重要……”

Her gaze fell upon the purple haired wonder who was trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.  
她的目光落在了那位试图尽可能不引人注意的紫发奇才身上。

"Come here my dear..."  
"过来，亲爱的..."

The bed barely withstood the weight of two pilots crashing on it. Or one pilot dive-bombing the bed while carrying another pilot.  
床几乎承受不住两位飞行员猛然倒下的重量。或者说，一位飞行员带着另一位飞行员俯冲轰炸般地砸在床上。

-The next morning- -第二天早晨-

The garbage truck stopped in the alley outside the apartment building. While the garbage men loaded the bags of garbage into the truck, one of the workers tripped over something. He stood up and looked blankly at the phone with a chunk of drywall attached to it, covered with glass shards. He glanced up as the truck turned the corner and busted a tire...  
垃圾车停在公寓楼外的小巷里。当垃圾工们将一袋袋垃圾装进卡车时，其中一名工人被什么东西绊倒了。他站起来，茫然地看着那部连着一块干墙的手机，上面覆盖着玻璃碎片。他抬头望去，卡车转过拐角时爆了一个轮胎……

...On a bent crowbar imbedded in the asphalt.  
……是一根弯曲的撬棍嵌在柏油路中。

Fortunately, four men carrying pitchforks and dressed in black leather quickly surrounded the truck and helped change the tire. Just as they finished, a goat legged man also wielding a pitch fork yelled at them for being nice and to get over here and help him with the apocalypse. Sweat-dropping and groaning, the four friendly guys followed after and disappeared in a flash of fire.  
幸运的是，四个手持干草叉、身着黑色皮衣的男人迅速围住了卡车，帮忙更换轮胎。他们刚完成，一个长着山羊腿、同样拿着干草叉的男人就对他们大喊，责怪他们太友善，让他们赶紧过来帮忙应对末日。四人汗颜叹息，随后紧随其后，在一阵火焰中消失无踪。

The garbage men quickly decided careers in accounting would be a pleasant change.  
垃圾工们迅速决定，转行做会计将是令人愉快的改变。

-End Game

[Marion Siegbahn](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4652307/Marion-Siegbahn): Well... It certainly was amusing... *Just sits and giggles like a little girl.* But good.  
嗯...确实挺有趣的... *就像个小女孩一样坐着咯咯笑。* 但挺好的。

[Kail-Mello](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2782928/Kail-Mello): Funny and sweet. X3 Loved it. Thanks for the read. ;3  
有趣又甜蜜。X3 非常喜欢。感谢阅读。;3

[Lowar](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1564933/Lowar): First of all, great jokes. (The HBOWAA was my favorite XD) The problem is, I think you're packing too many jokes into one story. I know it's a humor/romance, but you almost strangled it. Still a good job, though. :)  
首先，笑话很棒。（我最喜欢的 HBOWAA XD）问题是，我觉得你在一个故事里塞了太多笑话。我知道这是幽默/浪漫题材，但你几乎让它窒息了。不过，还是做得不错。 :)

[strangeone27](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1076398/strangeone27): Wow I actually feel sorry for that poor, poor Angel. A sexually frustrated Asuka is definatly a scary Asuka. O.o  
哇，我真为那个可怜的天使感到难过。一个性压抑的明日香绝对是可怕的明日香。O.o

[writer-jm](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/784100/writer-jm):
This story has to be one of my favorite stories for evangelion. Mostly, because it's not serious and it's psychotic(in the best kind of way).  
这篇故事绝对是我最喜欢的 EVA 同人之一。主要是因为它不严肃，而且非常疯狂（以最好的那种方式）。  
  
Asuka's hilarious. Her ranting and death threats make me feel better about my own complaining. Rei's twitching confused me at first, but I think she's easy to overstress and it shows. (thank you for letting her express herself.)  
明日香太搞笑了。她的咆哮和死亡威胁让我对自己发牢骚感到好多了。丽一开始的抽搐让我困惑，但我想她很容易过度紧张，这表现出来了。（感谢你让她表达自己。）  
  
I am fond of Asuka's bragging on the way to Rei's apartment and then passing it up. Her deflation nearly killed me! (once again, in a good way)  
我喜欢明日香在去丽公寓的路上吹嘘，然后又放弃的那段。她的泄气差点让我笑死！（又一次，是好的那种）  
  
My favorite part is the angel hunt scene. Asuka's... sex drive overrides her other systems and she completely annihilates the poor, lost angel. (I'm particularly fond of the angel's last thoughts, especially how it hears promises of torture in an unknown language)  
我最喜欢的部分是天使狩猎场景。明日香...性欲压倒了她其他系统，她彻底消灭了那可怜、迷失的天使。（我特别喜欢天使最后的想法，尤其是它听到未知语言中的酷刑承诺）  
  
Satan's little interlude was great too. (I'm far more likely to root for the other guy, but as a story, it's contagious) I especially am found of the ending with Asuka and Rei getting a happy ending and the four 'friendly' guys helping the garbage men.  
撒旦的小插曲也很棒。（我更倾向于支持另一个人，但作为故事，它很有感染力）我尤其喜欢明日香和绫波获得幸福结局，以及那四个‘友好’的家伙帮助清洁工的结尾。  
  
No other story has ever made me feel more sane than this one, nor made me prouder to be out of my mind. I wish I could relate this onto the page as you do.  
没有其他故事能让我感觉比这个更清醒，也没有让我更自豪地认为自己疯了。我希望我能像你那样把这个故事写出来。  
  
I keep your stories in my special eva folder on my computer, but to honor this work it will be placed on my favorites.  
我电脑里有个特别的 EVA 文件夹，专门存放你的故事，但为了表达对这部作品的敬意，我会将其加入我的收藏夹。  
  
Sincerely,
writer-jm

[RinnX](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/259233/RinnX): I thought it was really sweet (and funny.. _)to see how all of poor Asuka's attempts to flirt with her girlfriend had backfired on her.  Thanks for the great read!  
我觉得那真的很甜蜜（而且搞笑.. _），看到可怜的明日香所有试图和女友调情的尝试都适得其反，真是令人忍俊不禁。  感谢阅读，非常精彩！

[kariohki](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/63188/kariohki): This was a great story! It used the clashing personalities of Rei and Asuka really well, and it was so funny too!  
这是一篇很棒的故事！它很好地利用了丽和明日香性格上的冲突，而且非常有趣！

[Mr. Apocalypse](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/364720/Mr-Apocalypse): wow... now this is a good one. Pretty funny too. Most fan fics I read have Asuka and Rei all fluffy happy like (which I don't mind the least bit) but this is FAR more realistic compared with the series. *shakes hand* good job and keep the work up, oh and if possible... WRITE MORE PLEASE! We NEED more Asuka/Rei fan fics on  
哇哦...这真是个好作品。还挺搞笑的。我读过的大多数同人文里，明日香和绫波都甜甜蜜蜜的（我一点也不介意），但这部比原作要现实得多。*握手* 干得好，继续努力，如果可能的话...请多写点！我们需要更多明日香/绫波的同人文。

[Novaloria](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/255987/Novaloria): Just what the diminishing humour category needs, another fanboy with Asuka/Rei obsessions. In the name of *fun*, you wipe Shinji away like a fly on the windscreen, get Asuka to be best friends with Rei (Hikari nowhere to be seen) and to cap it off you have to include some iexplicable pitchfork men subplot. What really annoys me is that this has humour potential; the German immigrants and so on, but its buried under this Asuka/Rei pairing. Have you the patience, rewrite this, watch the series, and you'll have an above-average fic on your hands.  
正是日渐式微的幽默类别所需要的，又一个明日香/绫波迷。为了所谓的*乐趣*，你把真嗣像挡风玻璃上的苍蝇一样抹去，让明日香和绫波成为好朋友（光却不见踪影），最后还不得不加上一些莫名其妙的持叉人子情节。真正让我恼火的是，这本有幽默的潜力；比如德国移民等等，但都被明日香/绫波配对掩盖了。如果你有耐心，重写一遍，看看原作，你就能写出中上水平的同人文了。

[Glensather](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/329021/Glensather): 
That was a very good story, if a bit off. i.e. Rei's hair color. That's really the only problem with this story, though. Oh, and this is one of those stories where Romance is SERIOUSLY applied, but never delved into.  
那是一个非常精彩的故事，虽然有点小瑕疵。比如丽的发色。不过，这确实是唯一的问题。哦，还有，这是那种浪漫元素被严肃对待，但从未深入探讨的故事之一。  
  
Hai, if you can always write this funny and stuff, I'll be watchin' for you.  
嗨，如果你总能写出这么有趣的东西，我会一直关注你的。  

Rating: 8 out of 10 - You're going on my favorite author's list.  
评分：8/10 - 你被我列入最喜欢的作者名单了。

[Uzumaki](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/265740/Uzumaki): *heh* That was fun. I like the exaggerated high octane slapstick silliness. The little men with pitch forks was a nice touch. All in all pretty good stuff. Just one niggle though-Rei's hair is usually the colour of a clear summer sky or azure or any other kinda descriptive word for blue you can think of. But not purple. Unless, of course, she's dipping into Misato's beauty hair products.  
*呵呵* 真有趣。我喜欢这种夸张的高能滑稽搞笑。那些拿着干草叉的小人是个不错的点缀。总的来说挺不错的。不过有一点小瑕疵——丽的发色通常是晴朗夏日的天空蓝，或是蔚蓝，或者其他任何你能想到的形容蓝色的词。但不是紫色。当然，除非她用了美里那些美容美发产品。
