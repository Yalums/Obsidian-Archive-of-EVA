### Chapter 1 Prologue

_Author's Introduction: I don't own anything, its Hideaki Anno's baby. This is not a shipping fic, not in the conventional sense – it does have a very blatant Shinji / Asuka thing going on (which was the original intent,) but ended up becoming something else. It takes place before, during and after Episode 16 (the encounter with Leliel), but the timeline might be a bit wonky in some parts. I consider it to be an alternate take on a certain part of the canon storyline. This was fun (and harrowing) to write, went into unexpected territory, and ended up in a place of its own making. Out of habit, the chapters were all named after Zeromancer songs. The title is a play at the "Hedgehog's dilemma," as you might have guessed. Hope you enjoy it.  
作者序言：我并不拥有任何东西，这是庵野秀明的杰作。这不是一部常规意义上的配对小说——它确实有着非常明显的真嗣/明日香情节（这原本是创作意图），但最终演变成了别的东西。故事发生在第 16 集（与雷里尔的遭遇）之前、期间和之后，但某些部分的时序可能有些混乱。我认为这是对原作某一情节的另类解读。写作过程既有趣又令人心惊，进入了未曾预料的领域，最终自成一体。出于习惯，所有章节都以 Zeromancer 乐队的歌曲命名。标题是对“刺猬的困境”的一种戏谑，你可能已经猜到了。希望你喜欢。_

**Prologue 序章**

**(V)**

"Hello." “你好。”

"I brought you some lunch... or dinner. I'm sorry, I know it's kind of late for lunch..."  
"我给你带了午饭...或者说是晚饭。对不起，我知道这会儿吃午饭有点晚了..."

"I'm only allowed to bring in two at a time, I don't know why. It's just the rule. I would bring more if I could, honestly. Drinks, too. I'm sorry that I can't."  
"我一次只能带两样进来，不知道为什么。这只是规定。说实话，如果能带更多的话，我一定会带的。饮料也是。很抱歉我做不到。"

"I tried my hand at a kaiseki yesterday. It turned out better than I expected, but I couldn't pack anything steamed, not properly, so I did a triple portion of the sashimi instead. Misato found these little porcelain-like cups; Styrofoam, but painted to resemble them. Semi-insulated. The miso soup I made just before coming along, it should still be hot for a while."  
"昨天我尝试做了怀石料理。结果比我想象的要好，但我没法妥善打包蒸食，所以改做了三份生鱼片。Misato 找到了这些小巧的瓷杯；其实是泡沫塑料的，但涂成了瓷器的模样。半保温的。味噌汤我刚做好就带来了，应该还能保温一段时间。"

"Oh, and, uhh... the second one is a bit simpler: rice and, well... NERV doesn't let me order foodstuffs for my own amusement unless it clears a checklist, something about hormonal balance... and there's a second checklist for this place. I was going to have them fly in some bratwurst and put that in as well. So instead I put in different kinds of sausages; plus, two halved tomatoes, some lettuce and packed in spices for a back-up."  
"哦，还有，呃...第二个稍微简单些：米饭和，嗯...NERV 不让我随意订购食品，除非通过一个清单，关于激素平衡什么的...这里还有第二个清单。我本打算让他们空运些德国香肠来，也放进去。所以我就改订了各种香肠；另外，还有两个切半的西红柿，一些生菜，以及备用的香料。"

"They don't let me get anything liquid in here. Especially that carbonated stuff you like. Too much caffeine. I'm sorry."  
"他们不让我在这里拿任何液体的东西。特别是你喜欢的那种碳酸饮料。咖啡因太多。对不起。"

"...I know you won't speak to me. That you don't want to. I don't really understand any of it, but I know, at least."  
"...我知道你不会跟我说话。你不想。我不太明白这一切，但至少我知道。"

"I just wish we could talk, still. I know I am talking, because I have to talk for two, since you won't. But it's not really a conversation, and it's... well, dull, after a while."  
"我只是希望我们还能交谈。我知道我在说话，因为我必须为两个人说话，既然你不愿意开口。但这并不是真正的对话，而且……嗯，过一会儿就变得乏味了。"

"I'll bring my cello tomorrow. You can listen to me play, not really well, mind you, but still. It'll be something different. Of course, not sure they'd let me in with it, but I don't intend to give them a choice. They know me as _the Commander's son,_ high time I made someone think my father would do anything for my sake. Say his name, everyone's faces change. They say he's hardly ever around... wonder why that is. Wonder why that always was."  
"我明天会带上我的大提琴。你可以听我演奏，不是特别好，请注意，但至少是不同的。当然，不确定他们是否会让我带着它进来，但我没打算给他们选择。他们知道我是指挥官的儿子，是时候让某些人认为我父亲会为我做任何事了。提到他的名字，每个人的表情都变了。他们说他很少出现……不知道为什么。不知道为什么总是这样。"

"Oh, while I remember... Unit 03 is being flown in from America. They won't tell us what it was, but from what Rei heard from my father, there was a Unit 04 too, but it... disappeared somehow. I have no idea what that means, either."  
"哦，趁我还记得……03 号单位从美国运来。他们不会告诉我们那是什么，但根据我从父亲那里听到的，还有 04 号单位，但它……不知怎么就消失了。我也不知道那意味着什么。"

"We don't know who the pilot is yet. I hope it's someone good. I want to meet him, or her, but at the same time, I don't want to. I have many reasons, I think, but I guess it feels... too much like they'll be coming to fill your place."  
"我们还不知道新驾驶员是谁。希望是个优秀的人。我想见见他，或者她，但同时又不想见。我有好多理由，我想，大概是因为感觉...他们像是来取代你的位置的。"

"I've asked about that, too. Dr. Akagi says that it's not that. We'll just have four EVAs instead of three. She said... what was it... that we'd look for another pilot if you were to quit or... you know..."  
"我也问过这事。赤木博士说不是那样的。我们会有四台 EVA 而不是三台。她说...是什么来着...如果你要辞职或者...你知道的..."

"But that's good news, I mean, you are still the only pilot of Unit 02. You're still on the roster, and they're expecting you back. Dr. Akagi said there was no reason to change that."  
"但这其实是好消息，我是说，你依然是 02 号机的唯一驾驶员。你还在名单上，他们正期待你回来。赤木博士说没有理由改变这一点。"

"I've told you all that before, haven't I?"  
"我之前已经告诉过你们了，不是吗？"

"You know... there were times when I wished you just wouldn't say anything, wouldn't talk to me... but now, I can't think of anything I'd rather have you do."  
"你知道...有时候我希望你干脆别说话，别跟我交谈...但现在，我想不出还有什么比听你说话更让我愿意的事了。"

"I'll go. I'll leave the food here."  
"我会走的。我把食物留在这里。"

"Well, then. Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow."  
"那么，就这样。再见。明天见。"  
"...why?" "...为什么？"

He stopped, one foot out the door. He turned to glance at her. She hadn't moved. She was sitting cross-legged on the bed, her hands on her lap, staring at her palms. Her hair was masking her face.  
他停下脚步，一只脚已经迈出门外。他转头瞥了她一眼。她一动未动。她盘腿坐在床上，双手放在膝上，凝视着自己的手掌。她的头发遮住了脸庞。

He considered his response. It'd have to be perfect, it wouldn't do to have it any less – but he didn't understand the question. It could have been any number of things.  
他斟酌着回应。必须完美无缺，稍有瑕疵都不行——但他并不理解这个问题。可能是任何事情。

_But then again, when have I ever been able to read her?  
但话说回来，我什么时候真正读懂过她？_

"Why what?" he asked. “为什么什么？”他问道。

"...why do you keep coming back?"  
“……你为什么总是回来？”

### Chapter 2 The Pygmalion Effect

**Movement 1 第一乐章  
"The Pygmalion Effect" 《皮格马利翁效应》**

**1**

The walk back home was non-existent by now – a transitional event, not worth remembering. Besides, Shinji had gotten so used to walking it, to school and back, that he could practically traverse the pathway blindfolded and with his headphones on. He even knew which of the street lights would allow him to cross when, how many of those he'd have to pass... all the minute details of the path had become second-nature to him. The ear buds in his ear, the sound of music filling his mind, his entire being. Track 25, always, always Track 25 at this precise intersection, three steps to the end of the curb, four if you dragged your feet or took small steps, and if he hadn't stayed for cleaning duty, that meant that there would be a five to seven second wait before he could cross. The old lady from down the road wouldn't be there, because today was a Thursday and she wasn't-  
回家的路如今已不存在——那只是一个过渡性的事件，不值得记住。况且，真嗣已经习惯了这条上学和回家的路，他几乎可以蒙着眼睛、戴着耳机走完。他甚至知道哪些路灯允许他何时穿过，需要经过多少个这样的路灯……这条路上的所有细微之处对他来说都已成自然。耳塞在耳中，音乐充盈着他的思绪，他的整个存在。第 25 轨，总是在这个确切的路口，三步走到路缘尽头，四步如果你拖着脚或迈小步，如果没有留下来打扫卫生，那就意味着在过马路前会有五到七秒的等待时间。住在路那头的老太太今天不会在那里，因为今天是星期四，她不在——

Shinji collided with something soft yet sturdy, an object that wasn't supposed to be where it was standing now. He stumbled in place, his limbs temporarily losing coherence. He tripped over his own shoe, spun halfway around before finally finding his footing and noticing that in the process, he had lost his earphones. He found the cable dangling from his pocket, he pulled them up. Before he could put them back on, however, a very familiar voice made him freeze in place.  
真嗣撞上了一个柔软却结实的东西，那东西本不该出现在它现在站立的地方。他踉跄了一下，四肢暂时失去了协调。他绊倒在自己的鞋上，转了半圈才终于找到平衡，并注意到在此过程中，他的耳机不见了。他发现耳机线从口袋里垂下来，便拉了起来。然而，还没等他把耳机重新戴上，一个非常熟悉的声音让他僵在了原地。

"Watch where you're going, you-"  
“看路啊，你——”

Asuka. Upon seeing Shinji, she stopped herself short. She curtly turned away and put her hands on her hips. Her foot began tapping impatiently.  
明日香。看到真嗣后，她突然停住了。她生硬地转过身，双手叉腰。她的脚开始不耐烦地敲打地面。

The last three days had been weird. Ever since that strange, suffocating kiss, Shinji had found himself on the receiving end of, as always, Asuka's annoyance. He was sure that it had more to do with the fact that her precious Mr. Kaji was back with Misato, or so it seemed. She hadn't spoken to him at all. She had always made a point of not being in the same room as him, going as far as raising her Wall of Jericho if he had to be in the living room. She had made a point of passing the boxed lunch he had prepared for her to Hikari, as loudly and apparently as possible, constantly apologizing that she had to eat so bad a bento, but her stomach just couldn't take it. Hikari had cast a few confused looks at Shinji, but had eaten it nonetheless. She had managed to tell him, in hushed whispers out of Asuka's sight and earshot that his cooking was excellent, that maybe he could teach her a few things.  
过去的这三天异常古怪。自从那个令人窒息的奇怪吻之后，真嗣发现自己一如既往地成了明日香发泄怒火的对象。他确信这更多是因为她珍视的加持先生回到了美里身边，或者看起来如此。她完全没有和他说话。她总是刻意避免和他同处一室，甚至在他必须在客厅时升起她的“耶利哥之墙”。她特意将真嗣为她准备的便当大声地、明显地交给光，不停地道歉说自己不得不吃这么糟糕的便当，但她的胃实在受不了。光对真嗣投来几次困惑的目光，但最终还是吃了便当。她设法在明日香看不见也听不到的地方，低声告诉真嗣他的厨艺很棒，或许他可以教她几招。

Of course none of that was nearly as bad as the silence. It was almost piercing. Shinji could feel it pricking, and he was sure that he was, after a fashion, bleeding.  
当然，这些都不及沉默来得糟糕。那沉默几乎刺耳。真嗣能感觉到它在刺痛，他确信自己某种程度上正在流血。

He just didn't understand.  
他就是不明白。

What had he done, exactly? It couldn'tve been the kiss, because that, apparently, had been so horrible that she had had to rinse her mouth out afterwards.  
他究竟做了什么？不可能是那个吻，因为那个吻显然糟糕透顶，以至于她事后不得不漱口。

Shinji remembered it differently. He remembered her soft lips, gently pressing against his. He remembered freezing where he stood as the sensation had spread throughout his body, starting with his lips. He remembered the warmth of her, her closeness, and being unable to feel for what he was supposed to do. Sure, he had seen a few movies and read a few books, but that didn't tell him anything at all – and by the way she had been holding his nose, she thought it was some sort of a choking competition where the length of the kiss was determined by when one couldn't take not breathing.  
真嗣记得的却是另一番情景。他记得她柔软的唇瓣轻柔地贴上他的。他记得自己站在原地动弹不得，那种感觉从唇边蔓延至全身。他记得她的温暖，她的贴近，以及自己完全不知道该做什么。当然，他看过几部电影，读过几本书，但那些都没告诉他任何有用的信息——而且她当时捏着他的鼻子，让他以为这是一场憋气比赛，吻的长度取决于谁先憋不住气。

Still. The kiss, as strange and suffocating as it had been... had felt nice. Apparently, this sentiment was one-sided, because Asuka hadn't said word one about it since.  
尽管如此，那个吻虽然奇怪且令人窒息……却感觉不错。显然，这种感觉是单方面的，因为自那以后，明日香一个字也没提过。

The green light for them to cross came on, and Asuka stomped across the street, followed by Shinji, who was dragging his feet. He didn't want to go back home. At school or in the city, there were places he could run away to, even though he mustn't, where he could be safe from her hostile silence. But at home, he had no place to go. He could only spend so much time in his own room, and his homework, despite Asuka's belief that it was always left unfinished, would be over quickly.  
他们过马路的绿灯亮起，明日香跺着脚穿过街道，身后跟着拖着脚步的碇真嗣。他不想回家。在学校或城市里，总有他可以逃避的地方，尽管他不应该，在那里他可以远离她的敌意沉默。但在家里，他无处可去。他只能在房间里待上有限的时间，而他的作业，尽管明日香坚信他总是没做完，很快就会完成。

Maybe he'd start preparing dinner first thing. It'd give him something to do.  
也许他会先开始准备晚餐。这会让他有事可做。

**2**

Asuka, sitting on the couch and reading the stupid kanji list for the umpteenth time, watched Shinji cook up a storm out of the corner of her eye. She couldn't help it. His passion for the culinary arts came through loud and clear. When he was in the kitchen, his normally slouched posture and shaky grip on anything went away. Shinji the Idiot was replaced by a straight-backed, confident, precise Chef Ikari. His distractions and daydreaming were demolished in favor of focus.  
明日香坐在沙发上，第无数次阅读那愚蠢的汉字列表，用眼角余光看着碇真嗣在厨房里大显身手。她忍不住。他对烹饪艺术的热情清晰可见。在厨房里，他平时驼背的姿势和拿东西时颤抖的手都不见了。笨蛋真嗣被换成了挺直腰板、自信、精确的厨师真嗣。他的分心和白日梦都被专注所取代。

She remembered the first and probably only German word he knew, that he had thought about in the entry plug of her Unit 02. Baumkuchen. The tree cake. _Of course_ that'd be the first thing he thought of. It was, she had been surprised to learn, well-known in Japan. For someone who-  
她记得他知道的第一个，也可能是唯一一个德语单词，那是他在她的二号机插入栓里思考过的。Baumkuchen。树蛋糕。当然，他会首先想到这个。她惊讶地发现，这在日本也颇为有名。对于一个——

Asuka turned back to the stupid kanji. Hah. What did she care? He could be the world's greatest chef and it still wouldn't change the fact that he was an idiot. A bumbling apology-machine who handed out his apologies for what they were – worthless.  
明日香转回那些愚蠢的汉字。哈。她才不在乎呢？他可以是世界上最伟大的厨师，这依然改变不了他是个白痴的事实。一个笨拙的道歉机器，把他的道歉当作什么——一文不值。

Still, she couldn't keep her eyes from drifting in his direction. There was something about him when he was cooking...  
尽管如此，她的目光还是不由自主地飘向他的方向。当他烹饪时，他身上总有些东西……

_Stop it. 别说了。_

**3**

Misato called just as Shinji was preparing the stew. Asuka picked it up. She listened, and simply said 'okay' before hanging up and returning to her place on the couch. Shinji, knife still in hand, asked:  
Misato 打来电话时，Shinji 正在准备炖菜。Asuka 接了电话。她听着，简单地说了声‘好的’，然后挂断电话，回到沙发上的位置。Shinji 手里还拿着刀，问道：

"What did she say?" “她说什么了？”

Asuka didn't respond. Shinji sighed, partially with frustration. This was starting to get on his nerves.  
Asuka 没有回应。Shinji 叹了口气，部分是因为沮丧。这开始让他感到烦躁。

"What did Misato say?" “美里说了什么？”

Asuka was silent. 明日香沉默不语。

Shinji decided that maybe he could irritate her into answering. It couldn't be worse than this – Misato was still in the NERV HQ, something bad could have happened, maybe another Angel had shown up, maybe...  
真嗣决定或许他可以激怒她来得到答案。总不会比现在更糟了——美里还在 NERV 总部，可能发生了什么不好的事，也许又出现了使徒，也许……

"Hey, Asuka? What did Misato say? Was it bad? Is it another Angel?"  
"嘿，明日香？美里说了什么？很糟糕吗？又是一个使徒？"

"Nothing. Stop asking." "没什么。别问了。"

Shinji found himself feeling angry at the hostility in her voice. It was a simple question. He lived under the same roof as her, and he had a right to know if it was something important. Yet, it didn't look like she would answer.  
真嗣发现自己对她的敌意感到愤怒。这只是一个简单的问题。他和她住在同一个屋檐下，有权知道是否是重要的事情。然而，看起来她并不打算回答。

"Fine, don't tell me." Shinji said. He retrieved his SDAT player from the counter. He was about to put the earphones on, in almost desperate need for track 25, when Asuka's voice stopped him.  
“好吧，不告诉我就算了。”真嗣说道。他从柜台上取回自己的 SDAT 播放器。正要戴上耳机，迫切需要听第 25 轨音乐时，明日香的声音阻止了他。

"She's not coming tonight. They're preparing the sync test for the day after tomorrow and Dr. Akagi is worried about Rei... for whatever reason. They're gonna give her an extra turn at the plug. Commander's pet."  
“她今晚不会来了。他们正在为后天准备同步测试，赤木博士对绫波有些担心……不管什么原因。他们会让她多进行一次插入栓实验。司令的宠儿。”

Shinji nodded. Then he felt stupid for doing so – it's not like she was looking at him.  
真嗣点点头。随即觉得自己这样做很傻——她又没在看他。

"The stew's just about done, so dinner's almost ready. I also made-"  
"炖菜差不多好了，所以晚餐快准备好了。我还做了——"

"I'm not hungry." "我不饿。"

Her stomach growled audibly, and Asuka clenched her teeth. She had to admit that despite the act she had been putting on, Hikari's bento was miles from good. Everything in it tasted slightly stale, undercooked or overcooked, sometimes all at once. She had the basic procedures down pat, it seemed, but couldn't get a grip on the groove of cooking itself. And she, being far more inactive than the pilot, ate quite a lot less. Asuka had been spending the latter parts of the last three days hungry.  
她的肚子不争气地咕噜作响，明日香咬紧了牙关。她不得不承认，尽管她一直在装模作样，但光做的便当实在不怎么样。里面的每样东西都略显陈旧，要么半生不熟，要么煮过头了，有时甚至同时出现这些问题。她似乎掌握了基本的步骤，但却抓不住烹饪的节奏。而且，作为比驾驶员更不活跃的人，她吃得少得多。明日香在过去的最后三天里，越来越感到饥饿。

A part that she refused to acknowledge missed Shinji's cooking, so much that even the faint smell of the stew he had been making made her mouth water. She tried to ignore it. Misato wasn't there. There was no reason to make known the fact that she'd kill for a bite.  
她拒绝承认的一部分怀念着真嗣的烹饪，以至于他正在做的炖菜的淡淡香味都让她垂涎欲滴。她试图忽视这一点。美里不在那里。没有理由暴露她为了尝一口愿意拼命的事实。

Shinji eyed Asuka curiously. Did she really think that he would buy that?  
真嗣好奇地看着明日香。她真的以为他会相信那一套吗？

"You have to eat sometime."  
“你总得吃点东西。”

"Shut up, you idiot." "闭嘴，你这个白痴。"

"Come on, I _know_ you're hungry. Why won't you just... you know..."  
"拜托，我知道你饿了。为什么不就...你知道的..."

"As if I want to eat something you cooked. I said I'm not hungr-"  
"好像我想吃你做的东西似的。我说了我不饿-"

"Okay, that's _it!_" “好了，就这样！”

Asuka turned her head to see Shinji pull his apron over his head and, the SDAT player still in hand, toss it onto the kitchen counter.  
明日香转过头，看到真嗣把他的围裙从头上扯下，手中的 SDAT 播放器依旧握着，随手扔在了厨房的台面上。

**4**

"What the hell is the matter with you? What did I do wrong?" Shinji asked, "Why're you riding me?"  
“你到底怎么回事？我做错了什么？”真嗣问道，“为什么你总是针对我？”

Asuka bit her tongue on the truth. She'd never give him the satisfaction.  
明日香咬住舌头，没有说出真相。她绝不会让他得到满足。

"I must have done something, I mean... whatever I did, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry."  
“我一定是做了什么，我是说... 无论我做了什么，我很抱歉。好吗？我很抱歉。”

"Do you even know what you're apologizing for?" Asuka asked, slowly standing up.  
“你甚至知道自己在为什么道歉吗？”明日香问道，缓缓站起身来。

"I don't!" Shinji admitted, "I don't even know why you hate me so much!"  
"我不恨你！" 真嗣承认道，"我甚至不知道你为什么这么讨厌我！"

"Hate you? My, don't we think highly of ourselves? I barely notice you, you dimwit, I barely care that you exist!"  
"讨厌你？呵，我们还真自视甚高呢？我几乎没注意到你，你这个傻瓜，我几乎不在乎你是否存在！"

Shinji's eyes flared with a sudden flash of pure, unrestrained rage. Asuka felt a little taken aback when he stomped around the couch and walked up to her. She smiled, feeling her own anger course through her. There it was, his impotent rage. She had seen it before, she knew what was coming: a tantrum.  
真嗣的眼中突然闪过一丝纯粹、不受控制的愤怒。当他在沙发周围跺脚走向她时，明日香感到有些惊讶。她微笑着，感受到自己的愤怒在体内涌动。没错，他的无能愤怒。她以前见过，她知道接下来会发生什么：一场发脾气。

She didn't expect what actually came.  
她没料到实际发生的事情。

**5**

"Enough is enough." Shinji snarled. He was feeling what it was like to finally let loose, to finally venture past breaking point, "I don't even know what I did, but then again, I don't ever know what I do to tick you off! I don't ever know! You're always on my case about _something_ so I guess I can't do anything right, anything at all!"  
"够了就是够了。" 真嗣咆哮道。他终于感受到了释放的滋味，突破了极限，"我甚至不知道我做了什么，但话说回来，我从来不知道我做了什么让你生气！我从来不知道！你总是对我不满，所以我猜我做什么都不对，什么都做不好！"

"Got it on the first try." Asuka said, "You may not be a complete idiot, after all."  
"第一次就成功了。" 明日香说，"毕竟，你还不算是个彻底的傻瓜。"

"What's your _problem!?_ Ever since that night, you-"  
"你到底怎么了！？自从那晚之后，你——"

"Don't you dare go there. Don't you even think about it! It never even happened!"  
"你敢提那件事试试。想都别想！那根本就没发生过！"

"God's sake – what do you want from me!?" Shinji shouted, "What do you want?"  
"看在上帝的份上——你到底想要我怎样！？" 真嗣喊道，"你到底想要什么？"

Asuka's eye twitched. 明日香的眼角抽搐了一下。

"What makes you think I want anything from _you_..?"  
“你凭什么认为我想要你什么东西？”

She looked Shinji dead in the eye, and the cold, pure hatred he saw made him shiver.  
她直视着真嗣的眼睛，那冰冷而纯粹的恨意让他不禁打了个寒颤。

"And what makes you think... even for a moment... that even if I did want something, you'd be able to give it to me?"  
"是什么让你觉得...哪怕只是一瞬间...就算我真的想要什么，你能给我吗？"

Asuka could feel her blood boiling. Three days was such a short time, but it was all coming to a head in that moment. It was moving her tongue, shaping her words.  
明日香能感觉到自己的血液在沸腾。三天时间如此短暂，但一切都在那一刻达到了顶点。它驱动着她的舌头，塑造着她的言辞。

"What do I want? I want you to go away." She said, "I want you to go the fuck away."  
"我想要什么？我希望你离开。" 她说，"我希望你他妈的滚开。"

"Why?" Shinji said, feeling his scalp itch. He was close to losing it, "For God's sake, Asuka - what did I do?"  
"为什么？" 真嗣说道，感觉头皮发痒。他快要崩溃了，"看在上帝的份上，明日香——我做了什么？"

"See that!?" Asuka said, index finger poking Shinji's forehead, "It's not what you do, you idiot, it's who you _are!_ You're not just a spineless wimp, you're lazy, too! You expect me to tell you what's wrong, so you can mumble some half-hearted apology, like," her voice dropped a few notes and became a parody of Gendo more than Shinji, "'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mustn't run away, and I love saying that as I run away as fast as I can. I'm sorry. Did I mention I was sorry?' You're pathetic!"  
"看到了吗！？" 明日香说道，食指戳着真嗣的额头，"不是你做了什么，你这个白痴，而是你是什么样的人！你不仅是个没骨气的懦夫，还懒惰！你指望我告诉你哪里错了，然后你就能咕哝几句半心半意的道歉，就像，"她的声音低了几度，变得比真嗣更像源渡的模仿，"'对不起。对不起。我不能逃避，而我爱说这句话的同时却跑得越快越好。对不起。我说了对不起吗？' 你真可悲！"

"At least I am capable of saying that!" Shinji said, "At least I know that words like 'sorry' and 'apology' exist! You, you're so damn _perfect_ that it's never your mistake, is it? It's always everyone else's! It's always them, never you, God you're self-centered!"  
"至少我能说出那句话！" 真嗣说道，"至少我知道'对不起'和'道歉'这样的词存在！你，你他妈的太完美了，所以永远不会是你的错，对吧？永远是别人的错！永远是他们，永远不会是你，你真是自我中心！"

"Guess it takes one to know one."  
"看来是同类相知啊。"

"What's that supposed to mean?"  
"那是什么意思？"

Asuka growled in frustration as her hands pulled at her hair.  
明日香懊恼地低吼一声，双手扯着自己的头发。

"Ugh! It's even impossible to have a decent fight with you!" she shrieked, "You can't even follow the damn script!"  
"呸！跟你连场像样的架都打不成！"她尖叫道，"你连该死的剧本都跟不上！"

"Script? What, you rehearsed all this or something!?"  
"剧本？什么，你这是排练过的还是怎么的！？"

Asuka clenched her teeth, feeling her frustration hit the roof. She had. She had actually spent a sizeable chunk of the interim coming up with things to say. She had tweaked them to make sure that she would mean only some of it after the fact. If it hadn't been for that annoying little voice in her head that was telling her that she meant every word, so much so that she didn't mean any of it...  
明日香咬紧牙关，感到自己的挫败感直线上升。她的确是。她确实花了不少时间在中间想出要说的话。她调整了它们，确保事后只会部分当真。如果不是那个讨厌的小声音在脑海中告诉她，她每一句都发自内心，以至于她其实一句也不当真……

But Shinji calling her out on it had never been part of that.  
但真嗣直接指出这一点，却从未在她的预料之中。

Asuka felt her urge to wing it take over. She looked for something, anything, to become an outlet for her anger. Her eyes found the SDAT player in his hand. With a swift move, she snatched it clean from his fingers.  
阿斯卡感到自己想要即兴发挥的冲动占据了上风。她四处寻找，任何东西都行，只要能成为她发泄怒火的出口。她的目光落在了他手中的 SDAT 播放器上。她迅速一挥手，干净利落地从他指间夺了过来。

"What do you know!?" Asuka said, "All day long you walk around with _this_ stupid thing on and go on your way like a zombie! Hell, if it wasn't for Kensuke and Toji taking pity on you, you would be listening to this full time!"  
“你知道什么！？”明日香说道，“你整天带着这破玩意儿走来走去，像个僵尸一样！见鬼，如果不是因为真希波和东治可怜你，你早就整天听这东西了！”

"Asuka, please, give that back..." Shinji's expression shifted from one of anger to one of absolute worry, "Please..."  
"明日香，请把那个还给我..." 真嗣的表情从愤怒转变为绝对的担忧，"求你了..."

"And why are you so hung up on this thing anyway!?" Asuka said, feeling the plastic exterior of the device crackling in her firm grip, "Is it because nobody else in the whole wide world want anything to do with something so limited, so obsolete? Do you feel special with it?"  
"你为什么对这东西这么执着！？" 明日香说着，感觉到手中的设备塑料外壳在她紧握下发出裂响，"是不是因为全世界没人想要这种有限又过时的东西？你是不是觉得自己拥有它很特别？"

"Asuka, please-" "明日香，请-"

"Why are you always playing with this?"  
“你为什么总是玩这个？”

"I'm not playing with it, it's not a _doll_, so please just..."  
“我不是在玩它，这不是个娃娃，所以请别……”

Asuka waved it around, like the last drop she was dangling above the already full cup. Shinji's eyes were glued to it, darting in every direction that Asuka's hand was moving it to.  
明日香挥舞着它，就像她是在将最后一滴水滴入已经满溢的杯中。真嗣的目光紧随着它，随着明日香手的移动而四处转动。

"Please, Asuka, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay, I didn't mean-"  
"求你了，明日香，求你，对不起，对不起，好吗，我不是故意的-"

Asuka's eyes flared up at that word. If he said that one more time...  
听到那个词，明日香的眼睛顿时燃起了怒火。如果他再重复一次...

"Please, please, give it back... Asuka, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to say any of that, just... please just... plea-NO!"  
"求你了，求你，还给我... 明日香，对不起，我真的很抱歉，我不是有意说那些的，只是... 求你，只是... 求-不！"

Asuka, letting out a growl, wound her arm back and then threw the SDAT player at the wall.  
明日香发出一声低吼，将手臂向后一甩，然后用力将 SDAT 播放器扔向墙壁。

**6**

The SDAT player flew in a straight line and crashed into the wall. The sound of hard plastic cracking erupted form it as it was shattered to pieces – jagged-edged shards of what used to be his tape player scattered across the carpet. PenPen, watching from his cooling unit, decided that now might be a good time to disappear. The humans around him had a funny way of dealing with their possessions, and this kind of thing never ended well.  
SDAT 播放器直线飞出，猛地撞在墙上。坚硬的塑料破裂声随之响起，它被摔成了碎片——曾经是他的随身听的那些锯齿状碎片散落在地毯上。从冷却装置中观察的 PenPen 认为现在可能是消失的好时机。他周围的人类处理物品的方式很奇怪，这种事情从来都不会有好结果。

Asuka watched in shock and a bit of guilt as all color drained from Shinji's face. He had eyes like saucers. His mouth was hanging half-open. Frozen in place, he was staring at the wreck on the ground. However, Asuka noticed a small movement: his hands were slowly curling into fists. His anger was palpable, and with his jaw closing until his teeth were grinding into one another, it became tangible enough for Asuka to see that if she didn't say something, anything, to allay the situation, she'd be facing what she called the wrath of the meek. Her hand seemed to move on its own accord, fingers outstretched, reaching for him. She hadn't meant for that to happen, she really hadn't. Her anger seemed to have deserted her quick.  
明日香震惊地看着真嗣的脸色逐渐苍白，他的眼睛瞪得像铜铃，嘴巴半张着，僵在原地，目光死死盯着地上的残骸。然而，明日香注意到一个细微的动作：他的双手正缓缓握成拳头。他的愤怒显而易见，随着他紧咬牙关，直至牙齿相互摩擦，这份怒意变得如此真切，让明日香意识到，如果她不赶紧说些什么，任何话都好，来缓和局面，她将面对所谓的“弱者的愤怒”。她的手仿佛不受控制地动了起来，手指伸展开来，朝他伸去。她本无意如此，真的没有。她的怒气似乎迅速消散了。

Asuka found herself, even as she was reaching for his shoulder, wondering why he was this angry. Yes, she had broken his tape player and yes he did use it habitually to shut the world out, but it was, above all else, replaceable. NERV gave them all the entertainment technology they wanted. Hell, why wasn't he using a minidisc player anyway? They held more data, you didn't have to go through the hurdles of creating a mixtape if you wanted, they didn't degrade quite as easily, the sound quality was better and they were more portable – it fit into the palm of her hand. If anything, it'd be an improvement.  
明日香发现自己即便伸手去抓他的肩膀时，也在纳闷他为何如此愤怒。没错，她弄坏了他那台随身听，而他确实习惯用它来隔绝外界，但归根结底，这东西是可以替换的。NERV 为他们提供了所有想要的娱乐设备。见鬼，他干嘛不干脆用迷你光盘播放器呢？那玩意儿存储量更大，想要的话不必费劲制作混音带，也不那么容易损坏，音质更好，而且更便携——她一只手就能握住。说到底，这应该是个升级才对。

Yet his reaction was telling her that he wasn't just a laggard in adopting technology.  
然而他的反应却在告诉她，他并非仅仅是个技术落伍者。

"You know what..?" Shinji said, his voice so cold, it made Asuka shiver. She opened her mouth, without even knowing what to say. What could she say? That she was sorry? Was she, even? Part of her was still angry, part of her was viciously ticked off and thought that this was good. Good, he had broken something of hers, and now she had broken something of his. But this, the reaction she was seeing, it was... not what she had expected.  
“你知道吗……？”真嗣说道，声音冷得让明日香打了个寒颤。她张开嘴，却不知道该说什么。她能说什么呢？道歉吗？她真的感到抱歉吗？内心的一部分依然愤怒，一部分则恶狠狠地觉得这挺好。好啊，他弄坏了她的东西，现在她也毁了他的。但眼前这一幕，她的反应，却完全出乎意料。

Asuka realized that she had, unknowingly, done something terrible, something worse than she had intended.  
明日香意识到，她在不知不觉中做了件可怕的事，比她原本打算做的还要糟糕。

Shinji spoke again and Asuka felt her heart stop for a moment as he hissed the words out through clenched teeth.  
真嗣再次开口，明日香感到自己的心跳仿佛停了一拍，因为他咬紧牙关，嘶哑地吐出这些字句。

"_...fuck it."_ "...去他妈的。"

**7**

Shinji, without looking at Asuka, slowly walked to the door. He slipped on his shoes and retrieved his light, tan NERV jacket from the coat hanger on the wall.  
真嗣没有看明日香，慢慢地走向门口。他穿上鞋子，从墙上的衣帽钩上取下他那件浅棕色的 NERV 夹克。

Asuka was all tongue-tied watching him getting ready to leave.  
明日香看着他准备离开，一时语塞。

_Say something, say something, say something, say something, damn you! This isn't normal! He wouldn't-  
说点什么，说点什么，说点什么，说点什么，该死的！这不正常！他不会——_

Shinji slammed the door behind him.  
真嗣用力甩上了身后的门。

Asuka hesitated. Maybe she should go after him?  
明日香犹豫了一下。也许她应该追上去？

Hell with that. Stupid Shinji.  
去他的。笨蛋真嗣。

Well, might as well get smart, she thought, and see how to make it better. She turned and examined the wreckage of the tape player. She went over and one by one gathered all of the pieces of it she could find. She laid them all out on the dining table and sat down. This would be a walk in the park. She was a genius. She was tech-savvy. How hard could it be to piece a tape player back together?  
好吧，不如聪明点，她想，看看怎么能让它更好。她转身检查了磁带播放器的残骸。她走过去，一个接一个地收集所有能找到的碎片。她把它们都摊在餐桌上一一摆开，然后坐下。这不过是小菜一碟。她是个天才。她精通技术。把一个磁带播放器拼回去能有多难？

She could fix this. She could fix it.  
她能修好这个。她一定能修好它。

Two minutes with the pieces told her, however, that she couldn't. The SDAT player was gone. Some components had been broken in two, and some components that she was sure would find her feet later on were missing. The tape player was now only junk.  
然而，两分钟的研究告诉她，她修不好了。SDAT 播放器已经报废了。一些部件断成了两截，还有一些她确信日后会让她头疼的部件不见了。这个磁带播放器现在只是一堆废品。

Asuka stared at the broken puzzle in front of her. Why this thing? Why had it taken this piece of junk to finally send him over the edge? Why was it so important?  
明日香盯着眼前散落的拼图。为什么是这个？为什么偏偏是这件破烂最终让他崩溃？为什么它如此重要？

And more importantly, what had happened?  
更重要的是，发生了什么？

_What do you think happened, Asuka-chan?_ a shrill voice whispered, _you hurt him. You wanted to hurt him, and you did. You should be happy. He looked_ really _upset._  
你觉得发生了什么，明日香？一个尖锐的声音低语道，你伤害了他。你本就想伤害他，而你也确实做到了。你应该高兴。他看起来真的很沮丧。

_Shut your face. I didn't want_ this.  
闭嘴。我本不想要这个。

_Keep telling yourself that.  
你就继续这么告诉自己吧。_

She ran a hand through her hair and sighed. No. This was nothing. This was salvageable, at worst. So the tape player was broken. At best, she could have NERV secure her a new one. Mr. Kaji didn't like her spending NERV resources on such things, but allowances could be made, and upon Dr. Akagi's somewhat overwhelming insistence, the EVA Pilots were given preferential treatment beyond the telling of it. With some luck, some arm-twisting and some charm, she could have the new SDAT player in by tomorrow evening.  
她用手捋了捋头发，叹了口气。不，这没什么。最坏的情况也能挽回。就算录音机坏了，大不了让 NERV 给她弄个新的。加持先生不喜欢她动用 NERV 的资源做这种事，但特殊情况可以通融，而且在赤木博士的强烈坚持下，EVA 驾驶员们享受着超乎寻常的优待。只要有点运气，再使点手腕和魅力，她明天晚上就能拿到新的 SDAT 播放器。

Of course, the other, just as likely scenario was a little different. If she couldn't find or find the means to acquire a perfect replacement, she would go for the minidisc player that NERV was handing out like candy to its employees. They had a large library, and she could have all of Shinji's music written onto discs and ready to go.  
当然，另一个同样可能的情况则稍有不同。如果她找不到或无法获得一个完美的替代品，她就会选择 NERV 像发糖果一样分发给员工的那种迷你光盘播放器。他们有一个庞大的音乐库，她可以把所有真嗣的音乐录制成光盘，随时准备播放。

"Oh, what do I care!?" she said, as if only now catching her own thoughts. But the image of him standing there, fists clenched, almost trembling with anger told her that she should. This was, whether she had been thinking about it at the time or not, her doing.  
“哦，我有什么好在乎的！？”她仿佛刚刚才意识到自己的想法。但看到他站在那里，紧握双拳，几乎因愤怒而颤抖的画面告诉她，她应该在乎。无论当时她是否在思考这个问题，这都是她的责任。

**7**

Asuka ate. Although it was only lukewarm by the time she had gotten around to it, the stew was still beyond delicious. It was a celebration of taste itself, and to her hungry mouth, it was a slice of heaven-above-heaven. Halfway through her second bowl, however, it started to go stale as the thought of Shinji just slamming the door and leaving crept in. With every following mouthful, the food lost a little bit more of its taste until Asuka pushed it aside, feeling that she couldn't eat another bite.  
明日香吃了。虽然等到她开始吃时，炖菜已经只是温热，但它仍然美味得令人难以置信。这是一场味觉的庆典，对她饥饿的嘴巴来说，简直是天堂中的天堂。然而，当她吃到第二碗的一半时，想到真嗣猛地摔门离去，食物开始变得索然无味。每一口下去，味道都减少了一点，直到明日香把它推开，感觉再也吃不下任何一口了。

Huffing in frustration, she took the bowl and tossed it into the sink. She leaned against the kitchen counter and crossed her arms.  
她懊恼地哼了一声，拿起碗扔进了水槽。她靠在厨房的台面上，双臂交叉。

It was true. That little bitch in her head was right. She had wanted to hurt him, sort of. She had wanted to get under his skin, she had wanted to get to him, to bug him so much that he'd explode. Make him feel cornered, that there was no way to escape, and then maybe, see him blow up. In short, she admitted with a little bit of pain, she had wanted him to feel what she had felt.  
确实如此。她脑海中那个小婊子说得没错。她确实想伤害他，某种程度上。她想触动他的神经，想接近他，想让他烦躁到爆发。让他感到走投无路，无处可逃，然后或许，看他爆发。简而言之，她带着一丝痛苦承认，她想让他感受到她所感受到的。

Instead, what she had managed to see was Shinji Ikari imploding.  
然而，她所看到的却是碇真嗣的内心崩溃。

This wasn't what she wanted. This wasn't what she had tried to do. But there was no helping it now. Maybe she'd talk to him when he got back. She knew that she could be charming when she needed to be. It worked on Mr. Kaji every time.  
这不是她想要的。这不是她试图做的。但现在已无法挽回。也许等他回来后，她会和他谈谈。她知道在必要时自己可以很迷人。每次都能让加持先生为之倾倒。

It could at least get him on the level.  
至少能让他平心静气。

So Asuka reluctantly got back on the couch and took her notes on kanji. Five minutes was all it took to decide that she couldn't be bothered with it. She could read and write just fine, and the whole multiple-meanings-depending-on-how-it-was-written thing seemed to be trivia, nothing more. She set the notes aside, and turned on the TV. There was nothing on. Her eyes kept darting towards the door, almost waiting for him to come shuffling back in.  
于是，明日香不情愿地回到沙发上，拿起关于汉字的笔记。五分钟就让她决定懒得再理会这些。她读写都没问题，而那些根据书写方式有多种含义的东西似乎只是琐事，仅此而已。她把笔记放在一边，打开了电视。什么节目都没有。她的目光不断飘向门口，几乎是在等待他拖着脚步回来。

He had to come home sometime. And when he did, maybe she'd talk to him. Yes, that was it. She'd do that.  
他总得回家吧。等他回来时，或许她会和他谈谈。对，就这么办。她会的。

**8**

Asuka waited and waited and finally fell asleep on the couch.  
明日香等了又等，最终在沙发上睡着了。

### Chapter 3 Teenage Recoil

**Movement 2 第二乐章  
"Teenage Recoil" 《青春回响》**

**1**

Asuka woke up to her perpetually-set alarm clock ringing in her room. She felt sore all over; sore and cold. The TV was still droning on in the background, and Asuka noted that it probably had been on all night. Misato hadn't come home, then.  
明日香在房间里被永远设定好的闹钟吵醒。她感到浑身酸痛，又冷又痛。电视还在背景中嗡嗡作响，明日香注意到它可能整晚都开着。看来美里昨晚没回家。

She got up and stumbled across the living room. She went to the bathroom to wash up, splash some cold water on her face. Afterwards, she went to Shinji's room.  
她起身，踉跄地穿过客厅。她走进浴室洗脸，往脸上泼了些冷水。之后，她去了真嗣的房间。

"Shinji..?" she called, gently. No answer.  
“真嗣……？”她轻声呼唤，没有回应。

She opened the door. His bed was undisturbed. Asuka entered and took a look at his wardrobe. It was a Friday, which meant he shouldn'tve had any white shirts. But there it was, a single solitary white shirt, hanging there. Asuka's brow furrowed. She looked at his desk. Two notebooks; one open, showing a page of algebra, the numbers in neat, even lines. Yesterday's homework, due Friday. Due today. A cold feeling settled into the pit of her stomach. If anything, Shinji was meticulous with his schoolwork. Hell, half of his class was copying his notes – Toji, that oaf, couldn't make it through the week without Shinji lending him his homework.  
她推开门。他的床铺未曾动过。明日香走进去，看了看他的衣柜。今天是周五，按理说他不应该有白衬衫。但那里就挂着一件，孤零零的白衬衫。明日香皱起眉头。她又看了看他的书桌。两本笔记本；一本打开着，展示着一页代数题，数字排列得整齐划一。昨天的作业，周五交。就是今天。一股寒意在她心底蔓延开来。真嗣对学业一向一丝不苟。天哪，他班上有一半人都在抄他的笔记——那个笨蛋阿斯兰，没有真嗣借他作业，他一周都撑不过去。

All of this told her one thing: he hadn't come home last night.  
这一切告诉她一件事：他昨晚没回家。

But he had to come. If nothing, he had to come to pick up his school stuff, and they were all right here, sprawled across his desk and tucked away in their neat little places. Asuka checked the clock by his bed. By her approximations, he'd drop in soon, in about five to ten minutes. There was no need to worry. No need to worry at all.  
但他必须回来。即使没有别的事，他也得回来拿他的学校用品，而它们全都在这儿，散落在他书桌上，整齐地摆放在各自的小位置上。明日香看了看他床头的时钟。根据她的估算，他很快就会回来，大约五到十分钟内。没必要担心。完全没必要担心。

Asuka took her time to delve into his little archive. If she was going to find a replacement for the damn thing, she had to know what exactly he was listening to. She found a lot of old pop, mixed with some classical and a couple of dated, what-the-hell-are-these-still-doing-here tapes. Huh. Interesting choices. Asuka shrugged. There was no accounting for taste. She made a list in her head.  
明日香花时间仔细翻阅他的小收藏。如果她要找那该死的东西的替代品，她得知道他到底在听什么。她发现了很多老流行音乐，混杂着一些古典音乐和几盘过时的、这些玩意儿怎么还在这儿的磁带。呵，有趣的选择。明日香耸耸肩。品味这东西，真是说不准。她在脑子里列了个清单。

Asuka went to get ready. She put on her stupid uniform, sorted out her hair once more, looked to see if she had all the necessary things. When she was satisfied that everything was ready, she headed for the door, only to stop in the middle of the living room. She looked at the dining table and saw the pieces of the destroyed SDAT player. Maybe Shinji had come back, and had seen it. She couldn't have that. She went to the table and swept the pieces into her skirt, then went to her room and deposited them onto her bed.  
明日香去准备了一下。她穿上那件愚蠢的制服，再次整理了头发，检查是否带齐了必需品。当她满意地确认一切都准备妥当后，她向门口走去，却在客厅中央停了下来。她看向餐桌，发现了被毁坏的 SDAT 播放器的碎片。也许真嗣回来了，看到了它。她不能容忍这种情况。她走到桌前，将碎片扫进裙子里，然后回到自己的房间，将它们放在床上。

She heard the apartment door open, followed immediately by Misato's voice, which carried that rough, sharp tone of anger.  
她听到公寓门打开的声音，紧接着是美里带着愤怒的粗哑嗓音。

"...were you thinking!? I'd understand if you and Asuka had had a fight, God knows you two haven't been on the best of terms these last few days, but couldn't you have stayed at Toji's or something?"  
“……你在想什么！？如果是因为你和明日香吵架了，我还能理解，天知道你们俩最近关系一直不好，但你不能待在东治家或者别的什么地方吗？”

Asuka took a deep breath and stepped into the living room.  
明日香深吸了一口气，踏进了客厅。

"And getting into a fight, on top of all that, seriously, Shinji..." Misato ran a hand through her hair. Asuka looked at Shinji's hands. His knuckles were skinned, almost to the bone.  
“而且还在这种时候打架，真是有你的，真嗣……”美里用手捋了捋头发。明日香看向真嗣的手，他的指节擦伤严重，几乎见骨。

_A fight? Him? 打架？他？_

"Ah, Asuka!" Misato exclaimed upon spotting her. Asuka notice dark circles around her eyes. Her hair was frizzed up, and her clothes looked rumpled. She hadn't gotten much sleep last night, that much was clear, "You're ready for school?"  
"啊，明日香！"美里一看到她就喊道。明日香注意到她眼下的黑眼圈，头发蓬乱，衣服也皱巴巴的。显然，她昨晚没怎么睡，"你准备好去学校了吗？"

Asuka nodded, eyeing Shinji. He wasn't looking at her. Asuka felt anger clawing at her throat. Who did he think he was?  
明日香点点头，瞥了一眼真嗣。他没有看她。明日香感到愤怒在喉咙里抓挠。他以为自己是谁？

"You go on ahead." Misato said, "I'll drive Shinji today."  
"你先走吧。"美里说，"今天我开车送真嗣。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because he thought it was a good idea to spend the night in the park halfway down the hill." Misato said, "And he needs to freshen up before he goes... to say the least."  
"因为他觉得在半山腰的公园过夜是个好主意。" 美里说，"而且他需要洗个澡，至少得这样。"

Asuka fought to hide her surprise. The park? Not only hadn't he come home at all, but he had spent the night in the damn park!?  
明日香努力掩饰自己的惊讶。公园？他不仅没回家，还在那该死的公园过夜了！？

_What the hell's going on?  
到底发生了什么？_

"So, you go on ahead." Misato said.  
"那么，你先走吧。" 美里说道。

"See ya, then." Asuka mumbled before brushing past them.  
"再见。" 明日香咕哝着，从他们身边擦过。

Shinji was looking at the floor.  
真嗣盯着地板。

**2**

Asuka had to admit that the walk to school was boring without him around. With him, she knew she could bullshit all she wanted, and he'd be listening, if only half-heartedly. She'd work her way towards something about him, something small and insignificant, and then work that angle. Poke fun at him, get him to respond, to object. Despite his ability to hold a conversation when so inclined, Asuka had found out that he would never be the one to get it rolling, so that meant that the job was hers.  
明日香不得不承认，没有他在身边，上学路上的这段路程变得无聊透顶。有他在，她知道自己可以随心所欲地胡扯，而他即便只是半心半意地听着。她会设法扯到他身上，说些无关痛痒的小事，然后从这个角度切入。取笑他，让他回应，让他反驳。尽管他愿意时能很好地进行对话，但明日香发现他永远不会是主动开启话题的那个人，这意味着这个任务落在了她身上。

Wasn't that the problem? Hadn't that created the problem in the first place?  
这不就是问题所在吗？这不就是最初造成问题的原因吗？

Shinji was an idiot, that much, Asuka knew, and it had nothing to do with her dislike for his many facets. He just wouldn't take a hint, ever.  
真嗣是个笨蛋，这一点明日香很清楚，这与她对他诸多方面的反感无关。他就是永远不会领会暗示，从来不会。

As Asuka stopped at that street light, she couldn't keep her mind from drifting back to the memory of that kiss.  
当明日香在那个红绿灯前停下时，她的思绪不由自主地飘回到了那个吻的记忆中。

Her face started to burn red hot with both the recollection and the anger. She still remembered, she could still feel it. She had imagined that he would reciprocate. He hadn't any experience, and neither had she, which, she had thought, left him with the same pool of resources to make it through as her. Movies, manga, books, imagination. They would be, as much as she had trouble believing –and, she had to admit, begrudgingly, sort of wishing- they could be, on even ground. Maybe now he wouldn't be so shy, maybe now he would use the shallow pool of resources and...  
她的脸颊因回忆和愤怒而变得滚烫。她依然记得，依然能感受到。她曾幻想过他会回应。他没有经验，她也没有，她原以为这会让他们拥有相同的资源池来度过这一关。电影、漫画、书籍、想象。他们会，尽管她难以相信——并且，她不得不承认，有些不情愿地，有点希望——他们能处于同一起跑线上。也许现在他就不会那么害羞了，也许现在他会利用那浅浅的资源池，然后……

Asuka clenched her teeth, her anger bubbling to the surface once more.  
明日香咬紧牙关，怒火再次涌上心头。

_What was the use of it? What was the point of you? You wouldn't even hold me. You wouldn't even touch me!  
这有什么用？你存在的意义是什么？你甚至不愿抱紧我。你甚至不愿触碰我！_

_You won't even look at me.  
你甚至不愿看我一眼。_

Asuka could already hear that little voice.  
明日香已经能听到那个微小的声音了。

_Asuka-chan, tut tut. That's your fault, now, isn't it?  
明日香酱，啧啧。这可是你的错，不是吗？_

**3**

Hikari was rather cheery, chatting up a storm, telling Asuka something-or-other about cooking, and though her conditioned split-attention was keeping up with her just fine ("...it's just that takoyaki takes a lot of fine-tuning, and I think I should be able to use it to teach myself to cook more precisely. I really want... a special someone to...") she was more focused on the disturbing silence of Shinji Ikari, who was just standing in the doorway.  
光子显得相当愉快，滔滔不绝地聊着，告诉明日香一些关于烹饪的事情，尽管她的条件反射式分心处理得很好（“……只是章鱼烧需要很多精细调整，我想我可以利用它来提高自己的烹饪精度。我真的希望……某个特别的人能……”），但她更关注的是真嗣一反常态的沉默，他只是站在门口。

Upon noticing him, Hikari stood up, the balls of her hands pressing down her skirt. She always did that, Asuka noted, before going to scold someone. She stomped up to him, but was stopped by him holding up a bento box without a word. Hikari hesitated. Shinji he just stood there like a mannequin, but Asuka saw his lips move, soundlessly. Finally, Hikari took the bento, prompting Shinji to go to his desk, whereby he was immediately taken over by Toji and Kensuke. Asuka was about to turn her attention fully back to Hikari, because damn that idiot and whatever mood he was in now, when she saw Shinji take out his notebook and pass it to Toji. Toji opened it.  
注意到他后，光子站了起来，双手按住裙摆。明日香注意到她总是这样做，在责备别人之前。她大步走向他，却被他无声地举起一个便当盒拦住了。光子犹豫了。真嗣只是像模特一样站在那里，但明日香看到他的嘴唇无声地动了动。最终，光子接过了便当，真嗣便走向自己的桌子，随即被东治和健介围住。明日香正要完全把注意力转回光子，因为该死的那家伙和他现在的情绪，这时她看到真嗣拿出笔记本递给东治。东治打开了它。

"Wha-? Shinji, hey, man, ya feelin' okay?" Toji asked, "This's like, half done, ya never do these things halfway!"  
"什-？真嗣，嘿，兄弟，你感觉还好吗？" 冬治问道，"这就像，只做了一半，你从不半途而废的！"

"What!? Lemme see!" Kensuke practically leapt at the notebook, "Holy hell, it's true! You feelin' alright, buddy? Not coming down with a fever or something, are you?"  
"什么！？让我看看！" 健介几乎跳了起来抢过笔记本，"我靠，真的！你还好吗，伙计？没发烧吧，还是怎么了？"

"Whoah, what happened to your hands?"  
"哇，你的手怎么了？"

Shinji looked up, just for a second, and Asuka turned away. She had never seen his eyes like that. Vacant, completely devoid of life.  
真嗣抬头望了一眼，仅仅一瞬，而明日香却转过了头。她从未见过他那样的眼神。空洞，完全失去了生命的光彩。

Upon turning, however, she saw a bento box on her desk.  
然而，转身时，她发现自己的桌上放着一个便当盒。

"What's this!?" Asuka asked.  
“这是什么！？”明日香问道。

"Oh, umm... Ikari-kun gave it to me. It's yours. Or, if you want to trade again, it's mi-"  
"哦，嗯... 碇君给我的。这是你的。或者，如果你想再交换一次，它是我的-"

Asuka placed her hand on the box. It was warm.  
明日香把手放在盒子上。它是温暖的。

"I'll keep it today." She said.  
"我今天会保留它。" 她说。

By the fourth period, Asuka was certain that she was just about to scream loud enough to shatter all the windows of the school. The classes themselves were unremarkable, apart from her having to use her split-attention due to one half of her mind and perception being tied up trying to get a grip on Shinji. The recess periods were the worst.  
到了第四节课，明日香确信自己快要尖叫到足以震碎学校所有窗户的程度了。课程本身并无特别之处，只是她不得不运用分心术，因为她的半边心神和感知都纠缠在试图抓住真嗣的状态上。课间休息才是最糟糕的。

He was just sort of... sitting there. Toji and Kensuke were working overtime with their bickering, at one point delving into the subject of EVA designs (Kensuke's, ahem, "observation" that red stood out too much in any terrain and gave Unit 02 a handicap got Asuka's knuckles itching to meet a face,) to no effect at all. Shinji mumbled one half-hearted comment, that lasted about three words, per subject and Asuka found herself unable to listen to Hikari. She couldn't split her attention three ways.  
他就那样...坐在那里。当麻和健介的争吵愈发激烈，甚至一度深入到 EVA 设计的话题（健介所谓的“观察”指出红色在任何地形中都过于显眼，给二号机带来了不利条件，这让明日香的手指痒得想揍人），但这一切毫无效果。真嗣对每个话题都只含糊其辞地回应了三言两语，而明日香发现自己无法听进光子的话。她无法同时分心三处。

She found herself... no, worried wasn't the word. Why the fuck would she worry, and about him, too? She was more disturbed, yes, that was the word, disturbed. Petrubed. It was because he was disrupting the routine, yes, why not – he wasn't himself at all.  
她发现自己...不，担心这个词不对。她他妈的为什么要担心，还是为他担心？她更多的是感到不安，没错，就是不安。困扰。这是因为他在扰乱常规，是的，为什么不呢——他完全不像他自己了。

Beyond anything else, Asuka was frustrated.  
比其他任何事情更甚，明日香感到沮丧。

_What am I missing, here?  
我在这里遗漏了什么？_

Asuka considered it. She grudgingly admitted that there was only one thing to do – talk to him. She was cornered, and she knew it. She couldn't have Hikari ask him, because she didn't want him to know that she was confused about the whole ordeal. The real doll hadn't shown up on that day, on account of whatever synchronization problems they were smoothing over at the HQ. Shinji's "friends" were absolutely out of the question – she wouldn't sink that low if the world was ending.  
明日香思考着。她不情愿地承认只有一件事可做——和他谈谈。她陷入了困境，她很清楚。她不能让光去问他，因为她不想让他知道自己对整个事件感到困惑。那个真正的玩偶那天没有出现，因为总部正在解决一些同步问题。真嗣的“朋友们”也完全不在考虑之列——即使世界末日来临，她也不会堕落到那种地步。

For some reason, just going up to him and talking about it seemed like the hardest thing in the world.  
出于某种原因，直接走到他面前谈论这件事似乎是世界上最难的事情。

**5**

Asuka enjoyed Hikari's company as she wolfed down her lunch, so much so that Hikari had to note she was eating like she was furious at the rice balls. Asuka mumbled something about having skipped breakfast between mouthfuls, which was more or less true. She had prepared for the time where she'd have to semi-aggressively claim half of Hikari's lunch as her own. She hadn't expected Shinji to still bring something for her.  
明日香喜欢和光一起狼吞虎咽地吃午餐，以至于光不得不指出她吃起饭团来就像对它们怀有深仇大恨。明日香在咀嚼间含糊地说了句关于跳过早餐的事，这或多或少是真的。她已经准备好在某个时刻半推半就地抢走光的一半午餐。她没料到真嗣还会给她带东西。

"Ikari is a bit down today." Hikari commented, "Have you noticed?"  
“碇今天有点低落。”光评论道，“你注意到了吗？”

"No. I really haven't." "不，我真的没有。"

"Wonder what happened to his hands?" Hikari went on, taking a sausage cut up to resemble an octopus, "You've heard, right? He got in a fight and beat the guy senseless."  
"不知道他的手怎么了？" 光继续说道，拿起一根切成章鱼形状的香肠，"你听说过吧？他和人打架，把对方打得失去了知觉。"

"That's ridiculous." Asuka commented, "Haven't you ever seen him, or something? He's a shrimp!"  
"那太荒谬了。" 明日香评论道，"你没见过他吗？他那么瘦小！"

"What did you call it once... the wrath of the meek?"  
"你曾经怎么称呼它来着...温顺者的愤怒？"

Asuka swallowed hard and nodded.  
明日香艰难地咽了口唾沫，点了点头。

"I wouldn't be surprised if he packed a punch. Despite how he acts, Toji is really pretty strong, you know."  
"如果他真的出手，我一点也不会惊讶。别看他那样，东治其实真的很强，你知道的。"

"Toji? What does that oaf have to do with anything!?"  
"Toji？那个傻大个儿跟这事儿有什么关系！？"

"Oh, you don't know. That's right, I'm sorry."  
"哦，你不知道。抱歉，我忘了。"

"Know what?" "知道什么？"

"The first time Shinji piloted the EVA, he accidentally put Toji's sister in the hospital."  
第一次驾驶 EVA 时，真嗣不小心把东治的妹妹送进了医院。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. For the pilot that was fabled to have had _41%_ the moment he had sat in the entry plug, that was surprising. Heh. She knew that, despite his considerable skill, most of it was just hype.  
明日香挑了挑眉。对于那个传说中一坐进插入栓就拥有 41%同步率的驾驶员来说，这真是令人惊讶。哼。她知道，尽管他技术出众，但大部分只是炒作。

"Toji found him and got him." Hikari laid down her chopsticks, "Twice. Had Ikari on the ground with the first punch."  
“东治找到了他，揍了他。”光放下筷子，“两次。第一次出拳就把碇打倒在地。”

"He is sorta built, I'll give him that." Asuka said, "Of course, that's not saying much..."  
"他身材还算结实，这点我得承认。" 明日香说道，"当然，这也没什么大不了的……"

"After, I heard, Ikari helped him during the second attack. And I'm glad that he did. The idiot rushed outside of the shelter in the middle of it..." a wave of anguish passed through Hikari, and she shuddered, "After that, Toji decided that Ikari had to even things out between him."  
"后来，我听说，在第二次袭击中，碇君帮了他。我很高兴他那样做了。那个傻瓜在袭击最激烈的时候冲出了避难所……" 光痛苦地皱起眉头，颤抖了一下，"从那以后，东治觉得碇君必须和他扯平。"

"Even things out?" "扯平？"

"Asked Ikari to hit him, hard as he could."  
"让碇真嗣用力打他，越狠越好。"

Asuka threw the last bite into her mouth and hid her surprised behind her focused, almost driven chewing.  
明日香将最后一口食物塞进嘴里，用她专注且近乎强迫性的咀嚼掩盖了惊讶。

"And he did...I didn't see it myself, but the girls who have, told me that it was quite a punch coming from someone 2/3rds Toji's size. If that's true, then it's... impressive."  
"而他真的这么做了...我亲眼没看到，但那些目睹了的女孩们告诉我，那一拳来自一个只有东治三分之二大小的人，相当有力。如果这是真的，那真是...令人印象深刻。"

Asuka stood up without a word and hurried out of the classroom.  
明日香一言不发地站起身，匆匆离开了教室。

**6**

When Asuka made it to the roof, she wasn't disappointed. She had been right. Kensuke and Toji, the dumb duo, had gone off somewhere, and with the real doll absent, it only left him the roof to go to.  
当明日香到达屋顶时，她并未失望。她猜对了。笨蛋二人组真治和托基不知去了哪里，而真正的绫波丽也不在，这屋顶自然成了他的唯一去处。

True to form, he was there. He was alone, as Asuka had guessed. She gently closed the door behind her and steadied herself. She took a moment to take him in. He was lying on his back, hands tucked under his head, staring at the sky. Asuka noticed that she was, indeed, very much used to seeing him with his earphones on whenever he was alone – their absence was a minor, yet off-putting detail.  
果然，他就在那里。正如明日香所料，他是独自一人。她轻轻关上门，稳了稳心神。她花了一会儿时间观察他。他仰面躺着，双手枕在脑后，凝视着天空。明日香注意到，她确实已经习惯了每次他独处时都戴着耳机的样子——耳机的缺失虽是小事，却让人感到有些不协调。

_I don't even know why I'm here._ She told herself, _Why can't I just let him mope, like he will, anyway?_  
我甚至不知道自己为何在此。她自问，为何我不能像他总会做的那样，让他独自郁闷呢？

_Because I feel responsible.  
因为我感到有责任。_

_Because you_ are _responsible, Asuka-chan._  
因为你确实有责任，明日香。

_Because it's not adding up. That's it. Why would he get in a fight? What fight on this Earth could let him walk away without so much as a crease on his shirt, but would skin his knuckles to the bone?  
因为这不合逻辑。就是这样。他为什么要打架？这世上有什么样的战斗能让他毫发无损地离开，连衬衫都不皱一下，却把手打得皮开肉绽？_

_I'm... 我……_

Asuka exhaled. She then held her hands behind her, put on a smile, and approached him. He didn't hear her, and if he did, he didn't react, so Asuka bent down over him.  
明日香呼出一口气。然后她将双手背在身后，露出微笑，向他走去。他没有听到她的脚步声，即使听到了，也没有任何反应，于是明日香弯下腰，靠近他。

"Hey, Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

Shinji blinked. He slowly stood up, which was when Asuka's eyes caught his bento box. It was still half-full.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他缓缓站起身，这时明日香注意到了他那还剩一半的便当盒。

"You want the roof?" he asked as he stood up and wiped his hands on his pants, "I'll leave."  
“你想要屋顶吗？”他站起身，用手擦了擦裤子，“我这就走。”

He managed to take five steps towards the stairway door when Asuka's voice, in an extremely unfamiliar tone, stopped him.  
他刚朝楼梯门迈出五步，明日香用一种极其陌生的语气叫住了他。

"Wait." "等等。"

Shinji didn't turn around.  
真嗣没有转身。

"What's going on?" Asuka asked.  
"发生什么事了？" 明日香问道。

Shinji didn't say anything.  
真嗣没有说话。

"What happened to your hands?"  
"你的手怎么了？"

"Didn't you hear?" he shrugged, "I got into a fight. I won. Nearly killed him."  
"你没听说吗？" 他耸耸肩，"我跟人打了一架。我赢了。差点把他弄死。"

"Who with?" "跟谁？"

"What do you really want?"  
"你真正想要的是什么？"

"What..?" "什么..?"

"You want me to do something, don't you? So what is it?"  
"你想让我做些什么，对吧？那到底是什么？"

Asuka raised an eyebrow. What?  
明日香挑了挑眉。什么？

"What makes you say that? Maybe I just want to talk. Maybe I just-"  
"你怎么会这么想？也许我只是想聊聊。也许我只是——"

"You're..." Shinji said, "Never mind."  
"你……"" 真嗣说，""算了。"

_Oh, come on! How am I supposed to get anywhere if_ this _is what I'm given to work with?_  
哦，拜托！如果只有这些材料，我怎么能做出什么成果来呢？

"I just... I want to talk!" Asuka said, defensive, "That's it, that's what I want. Talk to me."  
"我只是...我想谈谈！" 明日香带着防御的语气说，"就是这样，这就是我想要的。跟我谈谈。"

_Does that mean he was right?  
这是否意味着他是对的？_

Shinji was silent. Asuka felt like tearing off every strand of hair on her head and eating her sync clips afterwards. She swallowed it down, just for the moment's sake.  
真嗣沉默了。明日香感觉自己想扯掉每一根头发，然后吃掉同步夹。她暂时忍住了。

"Things got out of hand last night." She said, "I didn't mean for that to happen. It wasn't... it wasn't what I wanted. I was just..."  
"昨晚事情失控了。" 她说，"我本意并非如此。那不是……那不是我想要的。我只是……"

"Why do you hate me so much?"  
"你为什么这么恨我？"

Asuka felt the question as she would a physical blow. There was nothing in his voice, posture or manner of asking it that suggested anger on his part. No, if she was reading this right, he sounded... resigned.  
明日香感觉这个问题如同一次身体上的打击。他的声音、姿态或提问的方式都没有表现出愤怒。不，如果她理解正确的话，他听起来……是无奈。

"Hate..." "憎恨..."

"I... thought we were friends." Shinji said, turning to face her this time, "I always tried to be nice to you. I..." his hands curled into fists, "I know –I knew- that you never really liked me. From the moment we met, you let me know what you thought of me – that I was beneath you."  
"我...以为我们是朋友。" 真嗣转过身面对她，"我一直努力对你好。我..." 他的手握成了拳头，"我知道——我早就知道——你从来没真正喜欢过我。从我们相遇的那一刻起，你就让我明白你对我的看法——我配不上你。"

Asuka could feel her heart pounding in her temples. Was it anger? Sadness? Shock? All? She wasn't sure.  
明日香能感觉到自己的心跳在太阳穴处砰砰作响。是愤怒吗？悲伤？震惊？还是全部？她不确定。

Maybe it was just a bit of regret?  
或许只是一丝遗憾？

"I never said that." Asuka said, aware of how pathetic that defense was, "I never said-"  
"我从没那么说过。" 明日香说道，明知这辩解多么无力，"我从未说过——"

"You didn't have to." Shinji said, "Anyway. I know we have to work together. We're pilots. You, me and Ayanami, we're... we have to be able to work together. And you're always great out there. And I know how much it means to you, so... no matter what... I won't screw that up for you if I can help it."  
"你不必说出口。" 真嗣说，"无论如何。我知道我们必须合作。我们是驾驶员。你、我和绫波，我们……我们必须能够协同作战。而你在战场上总是表现出色。我也知道这对你的意义有多重大，所以……无论如何……如果我能帮忙，我不会搞砸这一切。"

Asuka's lips were glued to one another. Her throat was itching. So many words had gotten stuck there, all knotted up, trying to get loose and wanting to be the first to get out.  
明日香的嘴唇紧闭着，喉咙痒得难受。那么多话语堵在那里，全都纠结成一团，争先恐后地想要挣脱出来。

"I'll be your backup, and I'll do all those things that I have to do in order to keep... well, you know. In order to keep us functional. But that's... I'm sorry, Asuka, but that's it for me. I tried. I really did, and I know it didn't –that I don't- mean anything to you at all," something was screaming inside Asuka, ", but I'd just hoped we could've been friends. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I wasn't a better person than I am for you to even consider it."  
“我会做你的后盾，我会做所有必须做的事情来维持……嗯，你知道的。为了让我们能正常运作。但那……对不起，明日香，对我来说就到此为止了。我尝试过，真的尝试过，我知道这对你来说——我不——毫无意义，”明日香内心有个声音在尖叫，“但我只是希望我们能成为朋友。对不起。对不起，我没有成为一个更好的人，让你甚至考虑过这一点。”

Shinji turned away, headed for the stairs. Asuka's lips were trembling. She had grabbed a handful of her shirt and wasn't letting go. Her iron will and stubborn determination was all that was keeping her in one piece.  
真嗣转身离开，朝楼梯走去。明日香的嘴唇在颤抖。她紧紧抓住自己的衬衫，不肯放手。她那钢铁般的意志和顽强的决心是她保持完整的唯一支撑。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

Shinji opened the door. 真嗣打开了门。

"I'm..." _you can say it. You owe him that much, just say it._ "I'm sorry."  
"我……" 你可以的。你欠他这么多，就说出来吧。"对不起。"

"You don't even know." "你甚至不知道。"

"Just don't..." "只是别..."

_Don't hate me! Please don't go! Don't go! Stop him, Asuka-chan, stop him, stop him!  
别恨我！请别走！别走！阻止他，明日香，阻止他，阻止他！_

"I'm sorry, okay? There, I said it, now..."  
"对不起，好吗？我说了，现在..."

"You don't even know what you're sorry for." Shinji said, without a hint of malice in his voice, "You don't know anything."  
“你甚至不知道自己在为什么道歉。”真嗣说道，语气中没有一丝恶意，“你什么都不知道。”

### Chapter 4 Ammonite

**Movement 3 第三乐章  
"Ammonite" 「菊石」**

**1**

There was one thing Asuka and Shinji had in common when it came to their EVAs, which also went for the sync tests. The moment the entry plug started to fill up with LCL. It only got worse from there on out, blind, overriding panic rising along with the liquid. Once it'd rise over their heads, they'd instinctively hold their breaths, and unable to do so, they'd exhale, letting LCL fill up their mouths and lungs. The fear went away after that, but it was the same every time, no matter how many times they had done it, both Shinji and Asuka still despised every obligatory second of it.  
在 EVA 相关的事情上，碇真嗣和明日香有一个共同点，那就是同步测试时进入插入栓的那一刻。随着 LCL 开始充满插入栓，情况只会变得更糟，盲目的恐慌随着液体一同上升。一旦液体淹没头顶，他们会本能地屏住呼吸，却又无法做到，只能呼气，让 LCL 充满口腔和肺部。恐惧感在那之后会消失，但每次都是如此，无论经历过多少次，真嗣和明日香仍然憎恶这每一秒的强制体验。

Once they were settled in, the com-line opened and Misato's voice reverberated through the entry plugs.  
一旦他们安顿下来，通讯线路便接通了，美里小姐的声音在插入栓内回荡。

"_Are you guys all settled in? Are you ready?"_  
“你们都安顿好了吗？准备好了吗？”

"Yes." Shinji said, his voice devoid of all human emphasis, mechanical. Asuka shivered.  
“是的。”真嗣说道，他的声音毫无人类的情感，机械般冰冷。明日香不禁打了个寒颤。

"Yeah. I'm ready. Let's go." Asuka said.  
"嗯，我准备好了。我们走吧。" 明日香说。

"Affirmative." Rei said. "明白。" 绫波说。

"_Good. We'll begin with the standard depth. Motor functions and basic movements only. The cap is 45%."_  
"好。我们从标准深度开始。只进行发动机功能和基本动作。上限是 45%。"

"We got up at seven thirty for 45%?" Asuka asked.  
"我们七点半起床就为了 45%？" 明日香问道。

"_Just do it."_ "就这么做吧。"

"Jeez, what is this, kiddy grade?" Asuka sighed, "So, Wondergirl." A slight hesitation, "Shinji. Up for it?"  
"天哪，这是什么，儿童级别吗？" 明日香叹了口气，"那么，奇迹少女。" 她稍稍停顿了一下，"真嗣。准备好了吗？"

No response. 没有回应。

"_Begin."_ "开始。"

Ritsuko lit up a cigarette and took a sip of lukewarm coffee from her cup. The observation room, decked out wall to wall with monitors and other equipment, smelled of heated silicon and plastic and was filled with the incessant clicking and ticking of spreadsheets being filled out. Her regular crew were in their respective places. Misato was right beside her, hands on her hips. Presently, Ritsuko was staring at the three adjacent monitors, each one showing one of their three pilots.  
律子点燃了一支香烟，啜了一口杯中温热的咖啡。观察室里，从墙到墙布满了监视器和其他设备，弥漫着加热硅和塑料的气味，充斥着不断填写的电子表格发出的咔嗒声和滴答声。她的常规团队各就各位。美里就站在她旁边，双手叉腰。此刻，律子正盯着三台相邻的显示器，每台显示器上分别显示着他们的三位驾驶员。

"How's Rei doing?" Misato asked.  
“丽的情况怎么样？”美里问道。

"The monitor will tell you once the measurements can be taken." Ritsuko said, "Besides, her fluctuations are why we're here with all three of them."  
“监测器会在数据采集完成后告诉你。”律子说，“而且，正是她的波动才让我们同时关注他们三人。”

"I still don't understand how its possible for her to start so low, reach so high and then fall below 21%."  
"我还是不明白她怎么可能起点那么低，达到那么高，然后又跌到 21%以下。"

Ritsuko stuck her free hand into her lab coat's pocket.  
律子将空着的那只手插进白大褂的口袋里。

"It might be pilot fatigue. The sync-clips, LCL suspension, constant synchronization and detachment, it should be exhausting."  
"可能是驾驶员疲劳。同步夹、LCL 悬浮、不断的同步与分离，应该很累人。"

"The weekly evaluations didn't show anything."  
"每周的评估报告并没有显示任何异常。"

"But Rei's sync ratio / time graph looks like a goddamn rollercoaster. It's- there we go."  
"但丽同步率/时间图看起来简直像过山车一样。看，这里又波动了。"

Ritsuko and Misato both leaned forward to read the results.  
律子和美里都凑上前去查看结果。

**First Children: Rei Ayanami, 47%  
初号机驾驶员：绫波零，47%**

**Second Children: Asuka Langley Soryu, 52%  
二号机驾驶员：惣流·明日香·兰格雷，52%**

**Third Children: Shinji Ikari, 60%  
三号机驾驶员：碇真嗣，60%**

"That's..." Misato couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.  
"那真是..." 美里忍不住挑了挑眉毛。

"Impressive." Ritsuko said. She leaned down and clicked the microphone on, "You're all doing good. Rei, you need to concentrate more."  
"真了不起。" 律子说道。她弯下腰，按下麦克风开关，"你们都做得很好。丽，你需要更加集中注意力。"

"_I understand."_ Rei's voice.  
"我明白了。" 丽的声音。

"_So, we done?"_ Asuka asked.  
"那么，我们结束了吗？" 明日香问道。

"Not quite." Ritsuko said. She took her finger off of the microphone's button and cut the line, "Increase depth by 12%."  
"还没完全结束。" 律子说。她松开麦克风按钮，切断了通讯，"深度增加 12%。"

"Depth increased, 12%." Maya reported. Ritsuko leaned forward and clicked the microphone on once again.  
"深度已增加，12%。" 真希波报告道。律子再次倾身向前，按下了麦克风的开关。

"Now we'll go to physical synchronization – muscle memory, reflex and grace."  
"现在我们将进行身体同步——肌肉记忆、反射和优雅。"

"_We're not damn ballerinas!"_ Asuka said.  
"我们可不是该死的芭蕾舞者！" 明日香说道。"

"Maybe. Concentrate now. The cap is 65%."  
"或许吧。现在集中注意力。同步率是 65%。"

**3**

Shinji could feel the entry plug sinking deeper. It felt like a pair of arms, smelling faintly of lavender, embracing him tighter.  
真嗣能感觉到插入栓在不断下沉。那感觉就像是一双散发着淡淡薰衣草香的手臂，将他拥得更紧了。

**4**

"What the..." Misato squinted to make sure she was seeing properly.  
“什么鬼……”美里眯起眼睛，确保自己看清楚了。

**First Children: Rei Ayanami, 68%  
第一适格者：绫波零，68%**

**Second Children: Asuka Langley Soryu, 72%  
第二适格者：惣流·明日香·兰格雷，72%**

**Third Children: Shinji Ikari, 80%  
第三适格者：碇真嗣，80%**

"Misato," Ritsuko turned to her, "Did something happen to Shinji? Something good?"  
“美里，”律子转向她，“真嗣是不是发生了什么事？好事？”

"He... well, don't you already know? The surveillance should have told you by now. He got in a fight two nights ago."  
"他...呃，你不是应该已经知道了吗？监控应该早就告诉你了。他两天前打了一架。"

"A fight? But there's no... he doesn't have a scratch on him."  
"打架？但并没有...他身上一点伤都没有。"

"His knuckles were skinned to the bone. I'd say, if he did beat someone half to death, it could have boosted his confidence, but..." Misato shook her head, "I don't know, he's been very withdrawn afterwards. He was shut off in his room when he wasn't at school. His friends called to make sure he was okay yesterday evening."  
"他的拳头都磨破了。如果他真的把某人打了个半死，那可能会增强他的自信，但是..." 美里摇了摇头，"我不清楚，之后他变得非常孤僻。不在学校的时候他就把自己关在房间里。昨天晚上他的朋友们还打电话来确认他是否还好。"

"I refuse to believe," Ritsuko said, "That this sudden leap in his sync ratio is related to negative stimulus." She sighed, "Let's see if we can take this somewhere. Maya, increase plug depth by 30%."  
"我拒绝相信，" 律子说，"他同步率突然飙升与负面刺激有关。" 她叹了口气，"让我们看看能否有所进展。摩耶，增加插入深度 30%。"

**5**

Asuka could feel the entry plug sinking deeper. It felt like a pair of hands, merciless, were choking her. She shifted uncomfortably in her seat. What, again? Why were they sinking deeper?  
明日香能感觉到插入栓在下沉。那种感觉就像一双无情的手，正扼住她的喉咙。她在座位上不安地挪动。怎么，又来了？为什么他们要加深插入？

"_Pilots. Stage 3. Physical/mental synchronization. Intuition, restraint, mental faculties, EVA-to-pilot feedback. The cap is 85%. On my mark."_  
"驾驶员们，第三阶段。身心同步。直觉、克制、心智能力，EVA 与驾驶员的反馈。上限是 85%。听我指令。"

Asuka shook the feeling off and focused.  
明日香甩开这种感觉，集中精神。

**6**

"Makoto, get ready to cut the synchronization of the Third Children."  
“真嗣，准备好切断与第三适格者的同步。”

"Cut it off..?" Misato asked.  
“切断同步？”美里问道。

"To what, ma'am?" Makoto asked.  
"什么，女士？" 真琴问道。

"Zero." Ritsuko said. "零。" 律子说。

"Why?" Misato asked. "为什么？" 美里问。

"If what I think will happen actually happens, it'll be necessary. Are you ready, Makoto?"  
"如果我所预料的事情真的发生了，那就必须这么做。你准备好了吗，真琴？"

"Ready!" “准备好了！”

Ritsuko turned the microphone on.  
律子打开了麦克风。

"_Begin."_ "开始。"

**7**

Rei could feel the depth the plug had sunk to. It felt like being entombed, or the way she imagined being entombed would be like – cold, dark and fathomless. She focused as best as she could, feeling her thoughts creaking under the pressure. It was nothing, she decided. Her EVA would understand, she would understand.  
丽能感觉到插入栓下沉的深度。那种感觉就像是被埋葬，或者她想象中被埋葬的感觉——冰冷、黑暗且深不可测。她尽可能地集中精神，感觉到自己的思绪在压力下吱吱作响。这没什么，她决定。她的 EVA 会理解的，她会理解的。

Rei always thought of her EVA as a woman.  
丽总是把她的 EVA 想象成一个女人。

**8**

**First Children: Rei Ayanami, 87%  
第一适任者：绫波丽，87%**

**Second Children: Asuka Langley Soryu, 90%  
第二适格者：惣流·明日香·兰格雷，90%**

"Why is it taking this long to measure his?" Misato asked, crossing her arms.  
“为什么测量他的要这么久？”美里问道，双臂交叉。

"Makoto, get ready to cut the connection." Ritsuko said, "Any second now."  
“真，准备切断连接。”律子说，“随时都可能。”

The monitor blinked and displayed the number on its lower left.  
显示器闪烁了一下，左下角显示出数字。

**Third Children: Shinji Ikari, 115%  
第三适格者：碇真嗣，115%**

"Cut it!" “切断它！”

"Yes, ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

Ritsuko spoke into the microphone.  
律子对着麦克风说道。

"_All right. The test is over. Get out and head for the showers. The debriefing will be short."_  
“好了。测试结束。出去前往淋浴间。简报会很快。”

**9**

The pilots showered, each one isolated in their adjacent stalls. LCL, now gel-like, clung to their skin and it somehow always managed to get under the plug suit. It washed off easily enough, but the high-powered jets of somehow perfectly warm water felt like a hundred needles barely scraping the skin, and the fact that the end of the shower would inevitably lead to a walk of shame to the short, but somehow infinitely long hallway leading to the locker room.  
驾驶员们各自在相邻的隔间里淋浴。LCL 如今凝胶般附着在皮肤上，不知怎的总能钻进插头服下面。它很容易被冲洗掉，但那些强力喷射出的恰到好处的温水却像数百根细针轻触皮肤，而淋浴结束必将导致一段羞愧的步行，穿过短暂却似乎无限长的走廊，通往更衣室。

The shower panels opened and let the pilots through. Rei was unaffected by her nudity, she walked as if status quo was preserved. Shinji would normally try to cover himself up, but today, he just shuffled along, wishing he had pockets to stick his hands into.  
淋浴间的隔板打开，让驾驶员们通过。丽对赤裸毫不在意，她行走如常，仿佛一切如旧。真嗣通常会试图遮掩自己，但今天，他只是拖着脚步，希望自己能有口袋把手插进去。

Asuka waited for them to clear the hallway and disappear through the double doors before getting out.  
明日香等他们穿过走廊，消失在双开门后，才走出淋浴间。

**10**

Ritsuko was waiting for them in between the lockers, chart in hand. She didn't seem to notice the three teenagers standing naked in front of her, and was even less interested when they started to put their clothes on.  
律子在储物柜之间等着他们，手里拿着表格。她似乎没有注意到三个赤裸的青少年站在她面前，当他们开始穿衣服时，她更是毫无兴趣。

"Now, here's the rundown." She said, "Rei, you're not down, but you're not up either. You're always barely above the cap. Your psych tests all come back fine, so I'm wondering if it's your body weighing your mind down. You will check in tomorrow for a complete physical."  
“现在，我来总结一下。”她说，“丽，你既没有下降，也没有上升。你总是勉强超过上限。你的心理测试结果都正常，所以我怀疑是不是你的身体拖累了你的思维。你明天来做个全面体检。”

"I understand." Rei said.  
“我明白了。”丽回答道。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

Asuka slipped on her panties and looked up at Ritsuko.  
明日香穿上内裤，抬头看向律子。

"Good performance, as always. Above the cap, sync graphs are harmonized admirably. You maxed out at 90%. Good job."  
“一如既往的出色表现。超过上限，同步图表协调得非常好。你达到了 90%的峰值。干得好。”

Asuka could feel the conflict of the last two days roll off her shoulders. She smiled, feeling her lips stretch to the limit.  
明日香感到过去两天的冲突从肩上卸下。她微笑着，感觉嘴唇拉伸到了极限。

"Shinji." Ritsuko said. "真嗣。" 律子说道。

Shinji, buttoning up his shirt, waited for her verdict.  
真嗣扣上衬衫扣子，等待着她的评判。

"That was... unprecedented."  
"那真是...前所未有。"

Asuka's smile faltered. It took a second, as if resisting, but then, vanished completely.  
明日香的微笑动摇了。她似乎在抗拒，但片刻后，笑容完全消失了。

"What?" she asked. “什么？”她问道。

"Your synchronization rate is well above the cap, and... to be perfectly honest, we're doing diagnostics to see if there was an equipment malfunction."  
“你的同步率远超上限，而且……老实说，我们正在进行诊断，看看是否有设备故障。”

Another blow. Asuka swallowed, feeling the constriction in her throat. Her had gone dry.  
又一击。明日香咽了咽口水，感觉到喉咙的紧缩。她的喉咙已经干涩。

"Diagnostics?" Shinji asked.  
“诊断结果？”真嗣问道。

"You shouldn't let what I'm about to say go to your head. The higher you are, the harder you fall, and I'd hate to see it happen to you at this stage. Do you understand?"  
“你不该把我接下来要说的话太当回事。站得越高，摔得越重，我不希望在这个阶段看到你摔倒。明白吗？”

Shinji nodded. Asuka held her breath.  
真嗣点了点头。明日香屏住了呼吸。

"Your synchronization rate in the final test was 115%."  
“你在最终测试中的同步率是 115%。”

Asuka felt her mind come to a screeching halt. Everything contained inside her, her every thought, urge, impulse and emotion was completely steamrolled over by the fact that Ritsuko had just spelled out for everyone to see. One simple fact that she couldn't escape, that was sending shivers throughout her body, making her hands tremble: she had been beaten.  
明日香感到自己的思绪戛然而止。她内心的一切，每一个念头、冲动、欲望和情感，都被赤木律子刚刚公之于众的事实彻底碾压。一个她无法逃避的简单事实，让她全身发抖，双手颤抖：她被打败了。

She had been bested by Shinji fucking Ikari.  
她竟然被碇真嗣这个混蛋打败了。

"What does that mean?" Shinji asked.  
“那是什么意思？”真嗣问道。

_You fucking idiot! What the fuck do you think it means!? It means you're...  
你这个白痴！你他妈的以为是什么意思！？意思是你……_

"You're number one, as Misato put it." Ritsuko said, "You are our top pilot as of now. Like I said," she added hastily, "Don't let it get to your head."  
"你现在是头号王牌，用美里的话来说。" 律子说道，"目前你是我们的顶尖驾驶员。就像我说的，"她急忙补充，"别让这冲昏了你的头脑。"

Ritsuko left. The clacking of her low heels left behind a thick silence, pregnant with meaning.  
律子离开了。她低跟鞋的咔嗒声留下了一片沉重的寂静，充满了深意。

**11**

Asuka couldn't think. She couldn't breathe. She could barely exist. There she was, dumbstruck, still unable to move or talk, watching Invincible Shinji Ikari slowly get dressed while humming a tune, probably one of those _fucking diabetes-inducing pop shits he likes so fucking much_.  
明日香无法思考。她无法呼吸。她几乎无法存在。她就那样呆若木鸡，仍然动弹不得，说不出话，看着无敌的真嗣一卡慢慢地穿衣服，嘴里哼着曲子，大概是那些他喜欢得要命的、甜得发腻的流行垃圾歌。

No.

_This isn't real, this isn't happening. There is no way, just no fucking way I landed second place, with this wimp as my better!  
这不是真的，这不是在发生。绝不可能，我怎么可能只得了第二名，还输给这个弱鸡！_

_Ritsuko did say they were going to check the equipment. That's what this is, an error. A glitch. That's what it is. That's what it has to be, that's the only way this makes any kind of sense.  
律子确实说过他们会检查设备。这就是问题所在，一个错误。一个故障。肯定是这样。只有这样才说得通。_

_I mean, he was okay, for Shinji Ikari... he was actually kinda good...  
我是说，对于碇真嗣来说，他还行... 实际上，他还有点厉害..._

_No._

_He didn't beat me. He can't beat me. He just can't, and that's that. That's all there is to it.  
他没打败我。他打不败我。他就是不行，就这么简单。事情就是这样，没什么好说的。_

_Ah, but Asuka-chan, there is more to it than that. That's not even why you're pissed off.  
啊，但明日香酱，事情远不止如此。那甚至不是你生气的原因。_

Asuka hated that whiny, shrill little voice in her head.  
明日香讨厌脑海中那个哀怨、尖锐的小声音。

**12**

Asuka got dressed, trying her damndest not to just reach out and grab him by the throat and shake him good. Shake him loose, shake him to fucking pieces. She watched him out of the corner of her eye. He was buttoning up his shirt. Just like that, like today was a Tuesday and he was getting dressed after gym.  
明日香穿好衣服，竭尽全力不让自己伸手掐住他的脖子，狠狠地摇晃他。要把他摇散架，摇得支离破碎。她用眼角余光观察着他。他正在扣衬衫的扣子。就像那样，仿佛今天是星期二，他只是在体育课后穿衣服。

The smile on his face, the unpronounced, almost non-existent smile made her blood boil.  
他脸上的微笑，那几乎不存在的、未说出口的微笑，让她怒火中烧。

"Maybe..." Shinji said, mostly to himself, "Maybe Father will praise me again."  
“也许……” 真嗣自言自语道，“也许父亲会再次表扬我。”

"Fat chance." Asuka said and watched the rather contented expression vanish from his face, "This is a fluke, a measurement error. And even if it isn't, it's a one-off."  
"没戏的。" 明日香说道，看着他脸上那颇为满足的表情消失，"这只是侥幸，一个测量错误。就算不是，也是一次性的。"

Rei, out of the corner of her eye, watched Asuka, who put her hands on her hips.  
绫波零用眼角余光观察着明日香，后者双手叉腰。

"And besides, what're you gonna accomplish with a rate like 115? You'll feel every blow, every cut! You won't get cut yourself, but you'll feel it like you were! You'll be incapacitated right from the start!"  
"再说了，115 的比率你能做什么？你会感受到每一次打击，每一次切割！你自己不会被砍伤，但你会感觉就像自己被砍了一样！一开始你就会被击垮！"

Shinji swallowed. 真嗣咽了咽口水。

"Thanks." He said, "God forbid, I might have enjoyed that for a few more minutes there. Thanks for saving me."  
"谢谢。" 他说，"天知道，我可能再多享受几分钟那感觉。谢谢你救了我。"

He slammed his locker door and walked away without saying anything else. Asuka huffed. _Fine. Be that way. I'm the one who has to save your ass when you're moaning in pain out there. I'm the one who has to save you._  
他砰地一声关上储物柜的门，一言不发地走开了。明日香哼了一声。好吧。就这样吧。当你在外面痛苦呻吟时，是我得去救你。是我得去救你。

A thought surfaced, surprising her.  
一个念头浮现，让她颇为惊讶。

_I don't want you to be in pain.  
我不想你受苦。_

Asuka caught Rei staring at her and shook off her thoughts. Something clicked in her head. She'd ignore the fucking doll glaring this once, if, the Commander's pet would answer a question.  
明日香发现丽正盯着她，便甩开了自己的思绪。脑海中某个念头一闪而过。她决定这次无视那个该死的玩偶的瞪视，只要指挥官的宠物能回答一个问题。

"Hey, Wondergirl. You're an expert on all things Shinji Ikari. Tell me, what's up with him?"  
"嘿，奇迹女孩。你对碇真嗣无所不知。告诉我，他怎么了？"

"He was happy. You ended that."  
"他曾经很快乐。是你终结了那一切。"

Asuka grit her teeth. 明日香咬紧牙关。

"I mean, what's up in general? He's been acting weird."  
"我是说，他最近怎么了？行为怪怪的。"

"What's your interest in Ikari-kun?"  
"你对碇君有什么兴趣吗？"

"I'm not _interested_!" Asuka protested, "I'm just... I'm just weirded out, that's all. He's walking around like a corpse! And besides, why would I need a reason? He's a co-pilot, and at this rate, he'll bring me down in the field."  
"我才没兴趣！" 明日香抗议道，"我只是...我只是觉得他怪怪的，就这样。他走路像个僵尸一样！而且，我为什么需要理由？他是个副驾驶员，照这样下去，他会在战场上拖我后腿的。"

There was a slight flicker in Rei's eyes that sent Asuka's frustration through the roof. A small, almost unnoticeable squinting, as if to say, I doubt that.  
丽的眼神中闪过一丝微弱的动摇，这让明日香的不满情绪直线上升。那是一种细微的、几乎难以察觉的眯眼动作，仿佛在说，我对此表示怀疑。

"Unlikely. For all intents and purposes, he is the number one."  
“不太可能。无论如何，他都是第一。”

"Like _shit_ he is! Sync rate doesn't do a damn thing out there! It's piloting skill, not how well you can feel your EVA!"  
“他才不是第一！同步率在外面根本没用！关键在于驾驶技术，而不是你和 EVA 的感应有多好！”

"That's irrelevant. If you want to know something about his thoughts, you should ask him. I am told that is the appropriate method."  
"那无关紧要。如果你想了解他的想法，应该直接问他。我听说那是恰当的方式。"

"If I wanted advice, I wouldn't ask you! God, it's just a simple question! Do I gotta get the brass to sign an order for you to-"  
"如果我需要建议，就不会问你！天啊，这只是个简单的问题！难道我得让高层下个命令你才-"

"What happened between you and him?"  
"你和他之间发生了什么？"

"H-how is that-" "那-那是怎么回事-"

"The answer to your question lies in the answer to this question."  
"你问题的答案就藏在这个问题的答案里。"

Asuka bit her lower lip. Her mind was raging against the idea of actually sharing something, no matter how trivial, with a fucking doll.  
明日香咬了咬下唇。她的内心激烈地抗拒着与一个该死的玩偶分享任何东西，哪怕再微不足道。

"We... had a fight. It got out of hand... kinda."  
"我们...吵了一架。有点失控了..."

"Did you damage his SDAT player during this fight?"  
"在这次争吵中，你弄坏了他的 SDAT 播放器吗？"

Asuka's eyes widened. She shivered. How..?  
绫波的眼眸睁大了。她颤抖了一下。怎么...？

"How did you-" "你怎么会——"

"He always carries it in the side pocket of his duffel bag. Invariably. It was absent today."  
"他总是把它放在行李袋的侧袋里。从未变过。但今天它不在那儿。"

"You give me the creeps, you know that?"  
"你让我觉得毛骨悚然，知道吗？"

Rei didn't respond. 丽没有回应。

"So why is the fucking tape player so important? NERV gives us all the latest in consumer electronics. He can have all the music he wants at the snap of a finger, all it takes is a requisition form and for Misato to remember to submit it. Why's he so hung up on it? Tell me."  
“那该死的磁带播放器为什么这么重要？NERV 给我们提供了所有最新的消费电子产品。他只需填个申请表，让美里记得提交，就能随时听他想听的音乐。他为什么对它如此执着？告诉我。”

"The tape player belonged to Yui Ikari."  
“那台磁带播放器属于碇唯。”

Asuka's heart skipped a beat. She felt like she had been doused with freezing cold water, followed by a shower of scalding hot water.  
明日香的心跳漏了一拍。她感觉自己仿佛被冰冷的水从头浇下，紧接着又被滚烫的热水淋了一身。

"Who is..?" “是谁……？”

"Ikari-kun's mother. It was a birthday present, given to her by the Commander."  
“碇君的母亲。这是司令送给她的生日礼物。”

_Oh, fuck me with a chainsaw.  
哦，用链锯操我吧。_

"How do you know that..?"  
“你怎么知道的……？”

"The Commander told me." “指挥官告诉我的。”

Asuka let that slide. 明日香对此置之不理。

"So it," Asuka started, trying to ignore the lump in her throat, "It had sentimental value..."  
"所以它，" 明日香开口道，努力忽视喉咙里的哽咽，"它有纪念价值……"

"According to what the Commander said, it is, or was, the only surviving memento of her that he did not destroy."  
"根据司令的说法，这是，或者说曾是，他未曾毁掉的唯一一件她的遗物。"

This was just getting better and better. Asuka could already feel the tingling in her chest, telling her that, yes, that was a riptide of thoughts, and it was about to tear her to shreds.  
事情似乎越来越精彩了。明日香已经能感受到胸中的刺痛，告诉她，没错，那是一股思想的激流，即将将她撕成碎片。

### Chapter 5 Send Me An Angel

**Movement 4 第四乐章  
"Send Me An Angel" “送我一个天使”**

**1**

Asuka was pacing her room in an admittedly small, but convenient circle. What that damned doll had said, what she had revealed, had just changed every fucking thing about what was otherwise a pretty tame incident. Now it wasn't just a fight, it wasn't just about taking her frustrations out on the one that had created them in the first place. Some things about the past four days, along with Shinji's ongoing awkward silence were starting to make sense.  
明日香在她房间里来回踱步，虽然地方确实不大，但还算方便。那个该死的娃娃所说的话，她所揭露的真相，彻底改变了原本相当平淡的事件。现在不仅仅是打架，也不只是把怒火发泄在最初引发这一切的人身上。过去四天里的一些事情，以及真嗣持续的尴尬沉默，开始变得有意义起来。

Of course, where they converged was the one place she just didn't want them to go.  
当然，他们汇聚的地方正是她最不想让他们去的那一个。

_I fucked up. But I didn't just fuck up, I fucked him up in the process. He only had the one thing to remind him of his mom, and I destroyed it. I just smashed the one thing he loved most to pieces.  
我搞砸了。但我不仅仅是搞砸了，我还把他搞得一团糟。他只有那一件东西能让他想起妈妈，而我毁了它。我把他最爱的那件东西砸得粉碎。_

The said pieces, Asuka knew, were tucked away in her desk drawer. She liked to pretend, in the past few days, that she could still fix it. Have a breakthrough, go back in and put it back together, good as new.  
那些碎片，明日香知道，被她藏在了书桌抽屉里。过去的几天里，她喜欢假装自己还能修好它。有所突破，回去把它重新拼好，完好如初。

_But I didn't know. I didn't know it was this! How could I have known it was this?  
但我当时并不知情。我怎会知道竟是如此！我怎可能知道会是这样？_

_Ah, but, Asuka-chan, it's not that you didn't know. You knew that it was important to him. You knew he cherished it. That's why you chose it – you knew it would hurt him more than what you could do or say.  
啊，但，明日香，并非你不知情。你明白这对他有多重要。你知道他珍视它。正因如此你才选择了它——你知道这比你能做或说的任何事都更能伤害他。_

Asuka hung her head. Yes, she had known. She had known it would hurt him, she had known it would make him feel a shred of what she had felt. But some part of her was aware, aware of the one thing that kept her pacing in the same circle: maybe she had done it just to drag him down, get him on the level with her.  
明日香垂下了头。是的，她确实知道。她知道这会伤害他，她知道这会让他感受到一丝她曾感受过的痛苦。但内心深处，她意识到，有一个念头始终让她在原地打转：或许她这么做只是为了将他拉下，让他与她同处一个水平。

Asuka was, almost preternaturally, aware of Shinji's presence in the house. Misato was absent again, as she had been the day after the sync test, locked up in NERV trying to do something-or-other with Rei and to re-examine test data. This left her alone with Mr. Number One, whom hadn't said word one to her, neither on the way to nor on the way back from nor during school. He had spent yesterday in his room, coming out only to use the bathroom, shower, or cook. She had tried to engage him, start a conversation or two, had even tried insulting him and start another fight, but he hadn't gone beyond the bare minimum of social contact.  
明日香几乎超自然地察觉到真嗣在家中的存在。美里又不在，就像同步测试后的第二天一样，她被锁在 NERV 里，试图和丽一起做些什么，或者重新检查测试数据。这让她和一号先生独处，他既没有在上学路上，也没有在放学路上，甚至在学校里对她说一句话。昨天他一直待在自己的房间里，只出来上厕所、洗澡或做饭。她试图与他交流，开启一两次对话，甚至尝试用侮辱来挑起另一场争斗，但他没有超越最低限度的社交接触。

He was walking around like a ghost. At school, he had barely talked to anyone and had disappeared for the roof soon as lunch hour began. He hadn't taken notes in class, he hadn't answered any of the stupid teachers' stupid questions. He had just sat there until school was over.  
他像幽灵一样四处游荡。在学校，他几乎没和任何人说话，午餐时间一到就立刻消失在屋顶上。他上课没有记笔记，也没有回答那些愚蠢老师的愚蠢问题。他就那样一直坐着，直到放学。

Asuka stopped her pacing. She was going crazy. The living room felt like a battleground when it was empty, and just going out there made her feel exposed. She didn't want to go out there. The paper-thin door separating her from the warzone felt like a reinforced blast door.  
明日香停下了踱步。她快疯了。客厅空荡荡的时候感觉像战场，只是走出去就让她感到暴露无遗。她不想出去。那扇薄薄的门将她和战区分隔开，感觉就像一扇加固的防爆门。

_This is insane. 这太疯狂了。_

_Aren't we all, Asuka-chan?  
我们不都一样吗，明日香酱？_

_Shut the fuck up. I don't even know who you are. I don't even know why you're in my head.  
闭嘴。我甚至不知道你是谁。我甚至不知道你为什么会在我的脑海里。_

_Who says I'm in your head? Maybe_ you're _in_ my _head, Asuka-chan._  
谁说我就在你脑子里？说不定是你在我脑子里呢，Asuka 酱。

_Then shut up just the same.  
那也一样闭嘴。_

Asuka grabbed her homework, slid her door open and went out to the warzone.  
Asuka 抓起她的作业，拉开房门，走进了战场。

**2**

Asuka marched straight to Shinji's room and slid his door open without bothering to knock. She found him lying on his bed, eyes fixed to the ceiling. His homework, she noted, laid on his desk, half-finished. He didn't react to her.  
明日香径直走向真嗣的房间，毫不客气地滑开他的门。她发现他躺在床上，眼睛直勾勾地盯着天花板。他的作业，她注意到，摊在书桌上，只完成了一半。他对她的到来毫无反应。

"Hey, Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

Shinji didn't say anything.  
真嗣没有说话。

"It's rude not to look at someone when they're talking to you." Asuka said.  
“跟人说话时不看着对方是很不礼貌的。”明日香说道。

Shinji looked at her. His eyes were cold.  
真嗣看向她。他的眼神冰冷。

"You Japanese have a weird written language." Asuka said, "Would it be too much to ask for you to use the Latin alphabet like normal people?"  
"你们日本人写的文字真奇怪。" 明日香说，"让你用拉丁字母像正常人一样写字，会不会太过分了？"

Shinji didn't react. 真嗣没有反应。

"Anyway. I thought you'd know this stuff. Which'd be a first."  
"反正。我以为你会知道这些。那可是头一回。"

She held out her book.  
她递出了她的书。

"This book is very poorly-written, I can't dumb down to its level." She said, "It's like a needlessly complicated puzzle, the kanji, katakana and hiragana. Like it'd kill you to use just one of them. Since you were born into it, I thought maybe you could show me what I'm missing in all these nuances."  
“这本书写得很糟糕，我无法降低到它的水平。”她说，“就像一个不必要的复杂谜题，汉字、片假名和平假名混杂。好像用其中一种就会要了你的命似的。既然你生来就接触这些，我想或许你能告诉我这些细微差别中我遗漏了什么。”

"You're the genius." Shinji said, "Why don't you figure it out?"  
“你是天才。”真嗣说，“为什么不自己弄明白呢？”

Asuka was certain of one thing: she probably wasn't hiding her shock very well. In fact, if the slackening of her jaw was any indication, she was probably just vacantly glaring at him.  
明日香确信一件事：她大概没能很好地掩饰自己的震惊。事实上，从她下巴的松弛程度来看，她可能只是在茫然地瞪着他。

She pulled herself together.  
她振作了起来。

"Talk about rude... serves me right for asking nicely."  
“真是无礼啊……我这么客气地问真是自找的。”

"Didn't you hear?" he asked, his eyes returning to the ceiling, "I'm an idiot. Even my sync test is a glitch. I can't show you anything."  
"你没听说吗？" 他问道，目光再次投向天花板，"我是个傻瓜。就连同步测试也是个故障。我什么也展示不了给你看。"

Asuka could feel a lump in her throat, where it wasn't supposed to be.  
明日香能感觉到喉咙里不该有的硬块。

"How does that even relate?" Asuka said, "I just asked-"  
"这有什么关系？" 明日香说，"我只是问了-"

"What do you want from me?" he asked, his voice almost choked, "I said I'd do what I can, and I'm doing what I can. I'm keeping things func-"  
"你到底想要我怎样？" 他问道，声音几乎哽咽，"我说过我会尽力，我正在尽力。我正在维持一切正常运作——"

"You're doing what you can? Really? You're just lying there all damn day, doing not much of anything, and then when I ask for a little-"  
"你在尽力？真的吗？你整天就那样躺着，几乎什么都没做，然后当我请求一点——"

"Help?" Shinji sat up, "What am I, completely brainless? As if you'd need help. As if Asuka Langley Soryu, the child prodigy, would need any help from the village idiot. No. You don't need help. And when you're too _fucking_ proud," Shinji stood up, ",to admit that you do, even then, you don't need help from _me._ You don't need me. You don't even want me. So why are you in my room!?"  
"帮助？" 真嗣坐起身，"我难道是彻底的傻瓜吗？好像你需要帮助似的。好像惣流·明日香·兰格雷，那个神童，会需要这个村子里的白痴帮忙。不。你不需要帮助。而当你太过骄傲，" 真嗣站起身，"，以至于无法承认你需要帮助时，即便那样，你也不需要我的帮助。你不需要我。你甚至不想要我。那你为什么在我的房间里！？"

Asuka was taken aback by his reaction. His anger was potent, his eyes were like daggers.  
明日香被他的反应吓了一跳。他的愤怒强烈，眼神如刀锋般锐利。

_He's... given this, whatever_ this _is, some thought. Clearly._  
他... 对这件事，不管这是什么，显然是经过深思熟虑的。

"And choosing what the Japanese written language... that's weak. You know, how many, four, five languages already? How is Japanese so difficult for you, then? You already speak it like you were born here! You're inventive, you always were, but how exactly were you planning on using my own mother tongue to let me know how worthless I am!?"  
“而选择日文书写语言... 这显得软弱。你知道的，你已经掌握了四五种语言，为什么日语对你来说就这么难呢？你讲得就像在这里出生一样流利！你一直很有创意，但究竟打算如何用我的母语来告诉我我有多无价值！？”

_What the... 什么鬼..._

"Get out." Shinji said, his gaze hitting the floor, "Just get out. Whatever it is you want, forget it, and leave me alone. I said I'd do what I can. That's the limit of what I'll do. The absolute borderline."  
"出去。" 真嗣说道，目光落在地板上，"就出去吧。无论你想要什么，忘掉它，让我一个人待着。我说过我会尽力。这就是我的极限。绝对的底线。"

Asuka couldn't breathe. Shinji's eyes suddenly shot up and looked into hers. She shuddered inside.  
明日香无法呼吸。真嗣的眼睛突然抬起，直视着她的眼睛。她内心一颤。

"Go. Don't pretend that I'm good enough to help you."  
“走吧。别假装我好到能帮你。”

**3**

Asuka put on her yellow summer dress, the one she had had on when she had first met Shinji. She liked matching her shoes to her sync clips when she had this dress on, and so she went for her red Mary Janes. She took her small handbag, stuck the key in it, and went out. It was nice and warm outside. She closed the door behind her, and started to walk down the hallway. She descended the steps quickly, enjoying the sensation of her body weight shifting slightly, creating the illusion that she was headed for a free-fall. When she got down to the ground floor of the apartment complex, she hurried out of the constricting walls. The open air felt like a blessing. To her right, she could see the skyline of Tokyo-3, glowing, with the sun in between its buildings, gently setting. It was a beautiful sight, and sometimes she came down just to watch the sun.  
明日香穿上她的黄色夏装，正是她初次遇见真嗣时穿的那件。她喜欢在这件裙子搭配时选择与同步夹颜色相配的鞋子，于是她穿上了红色的玛丽珍鞋。她拿起小手提包，把钥匙放进去，然后出门了。外面温暖宜人。她关上身后的门，开始沿着走廊走。她迅速下楼，享受着身体重量轻微转移带来的错觉，仿佛即将自由落体。当她到达公寓楼的一楼时，她急忙走出那些束缚的墙壁。开阔的空气感觉像是一种恩赐。在她右边，她可以看到东京-3 的天际线，闪闪发光，太阳在建筑物之间缓缓下沉。这是一幅美丽的景象，有时她会特意下来只是为了看日落。

Not today. No, not today. Today, she needed to get the hell away from this place.  
但不是今天。不，今天不行。今天，她需要彻底离开这个地方。

_And get the fuck away from him.  
然后滚远点。_

The park halfway down the hill was a circular, pocket-area that was just off the pavement. It had all the trappings of these kinds of parks, or simply enough commonalities with the others she had seen to qualify. The requisites were simple: pavement tiles instead of straight concrete. Benches that would help lonely fathers rest, couples grope and kiss, and idiots like Shinji sleep. Patches of grass in between, and the mandatory stone slab informing everyone that yes, indeed, this little spot was the handiwork of the Municipality of Tokyo 3.  
山腰处的公园是一个圆形的小区域，紧挨着人行道。它具备了这类公园的所有特征，或者说，与她见过的其他公园有着足够的共同点来符合标准。必备要素很简单：铺着地砖而非笔直的混凝土路面。长椅供孤独的父亲休息，情侣们摸索和亲吻，还有像真嗣这样的傻瓜睡觉。草坪点缀其间，还有那块必不可少的石碑，上面写着，没错，这个小地方正是第三新东京市自治体的杰作。

Asuka breathed a sigh of relief. Her anger was gradually subsiding, though it did leave her slightly drained. But being out of lockdown still felt like a blessing from Heaven. She picked a bench, neatly folded her dress under her thighs and sat down. In the distance, Tokyo-3 glowed, the tops of the buildings mere shadow-outlines. She could faintly hear the sea from where she was, and the occasional breeze carried a hint of salt water. She checked to see if she was alone. She was. Another high point for the unremarkable excuse for a park.  
明日香松了一口气。她的怒气逐渐消退，尽管这让她感到有些疲惫。但能离开封锁区依然像是天赐的恩惠。她选了一条长椅，整齐地将裙子叠在大腿下坐下。远处，第三新东京市灯火辉煌，建筑物的顶部只是模糊的轮廓。她隐约能听到海浪声，偶尔的风带来一丝咸水的气息。她检查了一下是否独自一人。确实如此。这个不起眼的公园又多了一个优点。

Asuka found herself staring at the toes of her red Mary Janes. Same red as her sync clips, same red as her bracelet, same red as her Unit 02.  
明日香发现自己盯着红色玛丽珍鞋的鞋尖。同样的红色，和她同步夹的颜色一样，和她手镯的颜色一样，和她二号机的颜色一样。

_And they look damn good on me. My feet are cute and my ankles are perfect. Kaji especially likes this pair. I wonder if I can just hop over to his, if he's at home?  
而且它们穿在我脚上真是好看极了。我的脚很可爱，脚踝也很完美。加持特别喜欢这双鞋。不知道我能不能直接跳到他那里，如果他在家的话？_

Asuka smiled. 明日香微笑了。

_He'd be impressed. He'd say-  
他会印象深刻的。他会说——_

"_Get out."_ "滚出去。"

Asuka choked on the thought.  
明日香被这个念头噎住了。

_No. He'd say- 不。他会说——_

"_Don't pretend I'm good enough to help you."_  
"别假装我够好来帮你。"

_No! That's not it! He'd say-  
不！不是那样的！他会说——_

"_Just get out."_ "滚出去。"

Asuka's hands curled into fists. She was shaking, feeling pure anger course through her. She clamped her legs shut, feeling every muscle in her body tense up. She was choking on it all, she couldn't breathe.  
明日香的手紧握成拳。她颤抖着，感受到纯粹的愤怒在体内奔涌。她紧紧夹住双腿，感觉到全身的肌肉都绷紧了。她被这一切扼住了喉咙，无法呼吸。

"_Don't pretend I'm good enough to help you."_  
“别假装我够好来帮你。”

"I don't _need_ your help!" she shouted, "Who the _fuck_ are you, _anyway_!?"  
“我不需要你的帮助！”她喊道，“你他妈到底是谁！？”

Her voice echoed. 她的声音回荡着。

"_You don't need me. You don't even want me."_  
"你不需要我。你甚至不想要我。"

"Who'd want _you?"_ Asuka leapt up, barely able to stand, trembling all over. The municipal slab caught her eye, "Who would be disgusting enough to want you, you fucking _loser!?"_  
"谁会想要你？" 明日香跳了起来，几乎站不稳，浑身颤抖。市政石板吸引了她的目光，"谁会那么恶心地想要你，你这个该死的失败者！？"

Anger and sadness in his eyes as he said it. Like a wounded animal asking why he deserved the hurt.  
他眼中带着愤怒与悲伤说出这话，像一只受伤的动物在问为何自己该受此伤害。

_Good. Hope it hurts. Hope it fucking hurts!  
好。希望它痛。希望它他妈的痛彻心扉！_

_Asuka-chan, you don't mean that.  
Asuka-chan，你不是真心的。_

_Yes, I do. I really, really do.  
是的，我确实。我真的，真的确实。_

Asuka looked at the slab and noticed two groups of stains, evenly-spaced. They were black in color, or at least, seemed to be black in the dying daylight. She reached for her phone, but quickly remembered she had left it at home.  
明日香看着那块石板，注意到两组均匀间隔的污渍。它们是黑色的，或者至少在日渐昏暗的日光下看起来是黑色的。她伸手去拿手机，但很快想起她把它忘在家里了。

She examined them. Not too long and not too wide, with small, uneven spaces in between. It had to be some sort of liquid, by the way it had splattered on the concrete. Her brow furrowed. She slowly clenched her fists and positioned herself, slouching to adjust for the minor difference in height. Slowly, she put her fists on the stains, her knuckles covering most of their surface area.  
她仔细检查着。长度和宽度都不太大，中间间隔着不均匀的小空隙。从液体溅在混凝土上的方式来看，这一定是某种液体。她的眉头紧皱。她慢慢地握紧拳头，调整姿势，稍微弯腰以适应微小的身高差异。慢慢地，她将拳头放在污渍上，她的指节覆盖了大部分的表面区域。

With a shudder, she realized that it was blood. _His._  
她不由自主地颤抖，意识到那是血，他的血。

Her first thought was revulsion having touched something stained with him.  
她的第一个念头是厌恶，因为她触碰到了沾有他痕迹的东西。

_I knew it! I knew that wimp hadn't gotten into a fight that he had actually won! That liar! And to think I was kind enough to-  
我就知道！我就知道那个懦夫没打赢过一场架！那个骗子！还以为我对他够仁慈了——_

The thought drowned itself out, collapsing under its own weight. Much to her exasperation, she couldn't deny that Shinji had never actually told her he had gotten into a fight, but had instead chosen to repeat the popular version, the gossip.  
这个念头自行淹没，在其自身重压下崩溃。令她恼火的是，她无法否认真嗣从未真正告诉过她自己打过架，而是选择了重复流行的版本，即八卦。

_As if he'd have the guts.  
好像他会有那个胆量似的。_

A split-second and she could picture him there, screaming as he pounded on the helpless block, letting out his rage. She wondered for a second if he had imagined striking her, wished that it was her and not this stupid marker.  
一瞬间，她就能想象他在那里，尖叫着对无助的方块猛击，发泄他的愤怒。她一时好奇，不知道他是否想象过打她，希望是她而不是这个愚蠢的标记。

_I'd kick his shrimpy ass forty ways from Sunday before he could even fully rewind a blow. Let him try!  
我能在他完全回过神来之前，用四十种方法把他那小虾米似的屁股踢得满地找牙。让他试试看！_

The assurance of her fighting prowess didn't have the desired effect, in fact, even before she had thought it, she confessed that Shinji wouldn't. Asuka had known others that would, and one that actually had during college. Some manchild who thought rejection warranted coercion, like _that_ could change her mind about the wretch. She had walked away with a hand print on her cheek, he hadn't been able to walk away.  
她对自己战斗能力的自信并未产生预期效果，事实上，在她想到这一点之前，她就已经承认真嗣不会这么做。明日香认识其他会这么做的人，大学时期就有一个真的这么做了。某个自以为是的幼稚男人，以为拒绝就可以用强迫来改变她的心意，好像那样就能让她对那家伙改观似的。她带着脸上的掌印离开了，而那个男人则无法行走。

_If he wanted to, he could've. Before he left the apartment. I'd stop him halfway, as my reflexes are far quicker, but still, he didn't.  
如果他想做，他本可以。在他离开公寓之前。我会在半路上拦住他，因为我的反应速度远超常人，但他没有这么做。_

Asuka hesitated to think it.  
明日香犹豫着要不要这么想。

_But why didn't he?_ I _would've._  
但他为什么不呢？我会的。

Her anger fading, damn it, she felt low, absolutely low. She shook her head and tilted her chin up. Nobody would get the pleasure of seeing her shook – not even herself.  
她的怒气消退，该死，她感到低落，非常低落。她摇了摇头，抬起了下巴。没有人会看到她动摇的快感——甚至她自己也不会。

**5**

Asuka walked back home after dark, moving from streetlight spot to streetlight spot, unsure as to whether she wanted to go back. She didn't quite have a choice, of course, but she was certain it was because she wouldn't deprive herself of a bed just because of something-or-other.  
黄昏后，明日香步行回家，从一盏街灯挪到另一盏街灯下，不确定自己是否真的想回去。当然，她别无选择，但她确信这是因为她不会因为某些事情就剥夺自己睡床的权利。

On approach, she saw that the lights of their building were on, specifically that of the living room. This meant that Misato was home for a change. Asuka smiled. She could act as a buffer between her and that idiot; a few beers in, and Misato would go into that mood that Mr. Kaji had described as 'tipsy.' Asuka didn't know why alcohol caused that, she had never been allowed to drink, and had never found herself in a position to sneak a beer or two. She had once taken a sip, under Mr. Kaji's supervision, some foreign thing called Guiness, but had loathed the taste.  
走近时，她看到他们公寓的灯亮着，特别是客厅的灯。这意味着美里难得在家。明日香笑了。她可以充当她和那个白痴之间的缓冲；几杯啤酒下肚，美里就会进入那种被加持先生形容为'微醺'的状态。明日香不知道为什么酒精会引发那种状态，她从未被允许喝酒，也从未有机会偷喝一两瓶。她曾在加持先生的监督下尝过一小口，一种叫吉尼斯的外国啤酒，但那味道让她厌恶。

_Adults. 成年人。_

**6**

Asuka's house key froze in the air once the first clear screech of shrill laughter broke through. She identified several murmurs, including one peculiar sound of a glass being picked up and put down with a regular rhythm.  
随着第一声清晰的尖锐笑声划破空气，明日香家的钥匙在空中凝固了。她辨认出几个低语声，其中包括一个奇特的声音，像是玻璃杯被有规律地拿起又放下的节奏。

"Kajiii, what're you doiiinn..." whined Misato.  
“加持先生，你在做什么呢...”美里抱怨道。

Mr. Kaji's characteristic, laid-back murmuring.  
加持先生那标志性的、悠闲的低语声。

"Well that's no excuse! Gimme that!"  
"那可不是借口！给我！"

The tap. A glass being put down, right on cue. Asuka clenched her teeth. The fucking real doll was there.  
水龙头。一个杯子适时放下。明日香咬紧牙关。那个该死的真人大小的玩偶就在那里。

Her ears perked. There was no sound to indicate Shinji was in attendance.  
她的耳朵竖了起来。没有任何声音表明真嗣在场。

_He's probably just in his room.  
他可能就在自己房间里。_

_Why not find out, Asuka-chan?  
为什么不亲自去看看呢，明日香酱？_

_I was going to go in anyway, you idiot!  
我本来就要进去的，你这个白痴！_

Asuka took a deep breath, toughened up and walked in. She discarded her shoes at the entrance and relaxed her posture before proceeding to the living room. She had just gone out for a walk, nothing important had happened... hell, nothing important did happen in Tokyo-3 besides the occasional Angel.  
明日香深吸一口气，鼓起勇气走了进去。她在入口处脱下鞋子，放松了姿势，然后走向客厅。她刚刚只是出去散步，并没有发生什么重要的事情...该死，除了偶尔出现的使徒，东京-3 也没什么重要的事情发生。

Inside, she could see the remains of what looked like a feast scattered across the table. Asuka felt her stomach growl at the sight, reminding her that she had skipped a meal, again. Asuka saw Misato, slurring a request while reaching for the open can of beer in Mr. Kaji's hand (rubbing up against him in the process, Asuka noted with a spark of anger.) The real doll was also there, as Asuka had deduced, still wearing her school uniform (did she only have that and her plugsuit?) and methodically draining her glass of water like a wind-up toy.  
屋内，她看到桌上散落着像是盛宴残余的食物。明日香看到这一幕，肚子不由得咕咕叫了起来，提醒她又跳过了一顿饭。明日香看到美里，正含糊地请求着，伸手去拿加持先生手中的啤酒罐（过程中还不忘蹭他一下，明日香注意到这一点，心中燃起一丝怒火。）那个真希波也在，正如明日香所推测的，依然穿着校服（她是不是只有这一套和插入栓服？），像上紧发条的玩具一样机械地喝着水。

And then, Shinji. Another still point in the adults' annoying bickering, like a statue at the table. Asuka hesitated. Maybe hadn't noticed her come in, so maybe they wouldn't notice her sneaking back out. Her hesitation cost her that opportunity, as Misato spotted her out of the corner of her eye.  
然后是真嗣。在成年人烦人的争吵中，他就像桌子上的一个静止点，宛如一尊雕像。明日香犹豫了一下。也许他还没注意到她进来，也许他们不会注意到她偷偷溜出去。但她的犹豫让她错失了这个机会，因为美里用眼角余光发现了她。

"Ah! Asuka!" she said with a wide grin, "You're here, finally! C'meeere!"  
"啊！明日香！" 她带着灿烂的笑容说道，"你终于来了！快过来！"

"Hello." Rei said with the slightest of nods.  
"你好。" 绫波微微点头回应道。

Kaji lit up a cigarette and put Misato's beer down.  
加持点燃了一支烟，并把美里的啤酒放下。

"You're late." He said, "Have you eaten?"  
"你迟到了。" 他说，"你吃饭了吗？"

"She hasn't!" Misato said, surreptitiously reaching and then hastily snatching her can from the table, "Come awnnn, eat!"  
"她还没吃！" 美里说，偷偷伸手然后迅速从桌上抓起她的罐头，"快来，吃吧！"

Asuka felt like she had walked into a firefight with a knife. She snapped out of it quickly and put her hands on her hips.  
明日香感觉自己像是拿着刀走进了枪战。她很快回过神来，双手叉腰。

"Looks like a celebration to me." She said, "What's the occasion?"  
"看起来像是在庆祝呢。" 她说，"是什么特别的日子吗？"

"It's nothing." Shinji said.  
"没什么。" 真嗣说。"

"Aww, c'mon Shin-chann, why so glummm?" Misato asked, reaching out to ruffle up his hair, "It's for you!"  
"哎呀，别这样嘛，真嗣君，怎么这么闷闷不乐的？" 美里问道，伸手揉乱了他的头发，"这是为你准备的！"

Asuka felt her blood boiling. The diagnostics hadn't even come in yet, that much she knew. Why did they feel the need to pamper him for something he hadn't even achieved? Was a glitch any reason to act like he had actually done anything?  
明日香感到怒火中烧。她知道，诊断结果甚至还没出来。为什么他们觉得有必要因为他尚未达成的事情而宠溺他？一个小故障就能成为他们表现得好像他真的做了什么的理由吗？

_They didn't treat me like this when I was number one... they don't treat me like this.  
他们在我排名第一时可没这样对待我...他们现在也没这样对待我。_

"It's nothing to celebrate." Shinji said, "It was a fluke. A measurement error. When the diagnostics is complete, Asuka will still be the first."  
“这没什么好庆祝的。”真嗣说，“这只是侥幸。一个测量错误。等诊断完成，明日香依然会是第一。”

Asuka felt offended by that (_as if I am not that right now)_, and some part of her was surprised.  
明日香对此感到冒犯（仿佛我现在不是这样），她内心的一部分也感到惊讶。

"Why do you say that Shin-channnnnn..." Misato cooed, wrapping one arm around him and pulling him in, "Even if it wass... 'tis the time for celebrashunn... you are number wannn..."  
“为什么这么说呢，真～君～～～” 美里娇声说道，用一只手臂环住他并拉近，“即使那是……现在是庆祝的时刻……你是第一名哦～～～”

"Innocent until proven guilty." Kaji said, smiling.  
“无罪推定。” 加持笑着说。

Asuka was indignant. 明日香感到愤愤不平。

_Oh God... please, please send me an Angel. Anything but this. Anything but this. I can't stand it.  
哦，上帝...请，请派一个使徒给我。除了这个，什么都行。除了这个，什么都行。我受不了了。_

### Chapter 6 Auf Wiedersehen Boy

**Movement 5 第五乐章  
"Auf Wiedersehen Boy" “再见，男孩”**

**1**

Gendo Ikari gently put down the spreadsheets he had been handed and crossed his hands. Behind him, Fuyutsuki was still going over his own copy. Gendo stared Ritsuko dead in the eye.  
碇源堂轻轻放下手中的报表，双手交叉。在他身后，冬月仍在仔细审阅自己的那份。碇源堂直视着赤木律子的眼睛。

"Are these accurate?" he asked.  
"这些数据准确吗？" 他问道。

Ritsuko nodded. 律子点了点头。

"Yes. We ran diagnostics just in case, only to prove that everything was functioning perfectly at the time of the test."  
"是的。我们以防万一进行了诊断测试，结果证明测试时一切功能都运行得完美无缺。"

"I don't see how this is possible." Fyutsuki said, "Dr. Akagi, what's your take on this?"  
"我不明白这怎么可能。" 富津说，"赤木博士，你怎么看？"

"It's unprecedented." Ritsuko said, "And dangerous."  
"这是前所未有的。" 律子说，"而且很危险。"

"Yes." Gendo said. "是的。" 源堂说。

"Any synchronization ratio above 100% is unexplored territory... not completely, but by and large. It's well outside of our margins of safety."  
"任何同步率超过 100%的领域都是未被探索过的...不完全如此，但大体上是。这远远超出了我们的安全边际。"

"Categorically, the activation test isn't the same as operating an EVA. Neither are the Simulation Bodies." Fyutsuki said, "But I see your point."  
"明确地说，激活测试与操作 EVA 不同。模拟体也同样不是一回事。" 冬月说，"但我明白你的意思。"

"What's your recommendation?" Gendo asked.  
"你有什么建议？" 碇源堂问。

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. She knew Gendo Ikari well enough to know that he already had a plan of action, which wouldn't be shifted in the slightest by anything she'd have to recommend. Still.  
赤木律子挑了挑眉。她很了解碇源堂，知道他早已有了行动计划，她的任何建议都无法动摇他分毫。尽管如此。

"At this stage, I think, one of two things. One, set the cap at 100% and repeat the test, measure his performance against the other pilots."  
"在这个阶段，我认为有两种可能。一是将上限设为 100%，然后重复测试，衡量他的表现与其他飞行员相比。"

"Not an option." Gendo said.  
"这不是个选项。" 碇源堂说。

_Of course not. 当然不是。_

"Then I would like to repeat the test with the same caps, see if the ratio can be reproduced within acceptable margins."  
"那么我希望能用同样的帽型重复测试，看看能否在可接受的误差范围内重现这个比例。"

"The Angel is nine days away, I am sure you know." Fyutsuki said, "The Magi's estimate gives an SD of twelve hours, nothing more."  
"使徒还有九天到达，我相信你清楚。" 冬月说，"MAGI 的估算误差在十二小时内，仅此而已。"

"Carry out the test today." Gendo said.  
"今天进行测试。" 碇源堂说。"

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

"Furthermore..." "此外……"

"Yes?" “是？”

"If Shinji scores above 100%, he will be pulled out of school immediately and undergo a 7-day intensive round of combat training."  
"如果真嗣得分超过 100%，他将立即被学校开除，并接受为期 7 天的强化战斗训练。"

"Combat training?" Ritsuko asked, "What for?"  
"战斗训练？" 律子问道，"为什么？"

"You have your orders." “你接到命令了。”

**2**

Asuka watched as Shinji got dressed and found it strange that he did not tuck in his shirt, as he always did. She noted with some annoyance that Rei's vacant, all-seeing eyes hadn't missed that little deviation either. She looked away, concentrating instead on buttoning up her own shirt.  
明日香看着真嗣穿衣服，奇怪的是他这次没有把衬衫塞进裤子里，这是他一贯的做法。她有些恼火地注意到，绫波零那空洞、无所不见的眼睛也没有错过这个小偏差。她转过头去，专注于扣好自己的衬衫。

They had been pulled out of school early, and though skipping their afternoon classes had been a joy, having spent the hours leading well into the evening in test plugs had been strange. Random testing was a method as effective as any, Asuka knew. There were ways to mentally prepare for synchronization, be it for a test or to go out into the field. Asuka had this lullaby stuck in her head, which always helped her calm down and collect her thoughts before going into the plug. It was fast and she could do it on-the-go. It frightened her and consoled her at the same time, though she didn't know why.  
他们被提前从学校拉了出来，虽然逃掉下午的课很开心，但在测试插槽里度过了从下午到晚上的时间却很奇怪。随机测试就像任何有效的方法一样，明日香知道。无论是测试还是进入实战，都有方法在精神上做好准备。明日香脑海中总是回荡着一首摇篮曲，每次进入插槽前都能帮助她平静下来，集中思绪。这首歌节奏很快，她可以随时随地唱出来。它既让她害怕又给她安慰，尽管她不知道为什么。

Shinji still wouldn't acknowledge her presence, which, in turn, had created this reflexive response in her – she was hyper-aware of him. It ticked her off to no end, to have her genius focus always operate on a split-attention basis, and because of him, no less. On the one hand, there was the world of NERV that she was a blessing to.  
真嗣仍然不愿承认她的存在，这反过来又在她身上形成了这种条件反射——她对他异常敏感。这让她无比恼火，她的天才专注力总是被迫分散，而且还是因为他。一方面，她是 NERV 的福音。

On the other hand, Shinji fucking Ikari.  
另一方面，是真嗣那个混蛋碇。

It infuriated her, his half-hearted, faked responses to the friends he was lucky beyond the telling of it to have. Who'd wanna get with him, she wondered, except perhaps two equally repugnant losers he hung with? And even they were limited in their interactions, to which Shinji was now occasionally contributing. It drove her up the wall that he shuffled through the day, disappearing to the roof during lunch (as usual.)  
他对他那些幸运得难以言表的朋友们的敷衍、假装的回应让她愤怒。她想，除了他那两个同样令人讨厌的跟班，还有谁会想和他在一起呢？甚至他们的互动也有限，现在真嗣偶尔也会参与其中。他整天拖拖拉拉，午饭时消失在屋顶（一如既往），这让她气得发疯。

It pissed her off royally.  
这让她非常恼火。

_Who the hell do you think you are, anyway? You're just a wimp who got an EVA because his daddy was the Commander, and you can't even do shit with it. No. No no no, you don't shut me out. You don't tell me to get out.  
你他妈以为自己是谁啊？不过是个靠老爸是司令才得到 EVA 的懦夫，连用它干点什么都做不到。不，不不不，你别想把我拒之门外。你没资格叫我滚。_

Except, he had, and his invisible Wall of Jericho made her want to scream. So she had tried to raise the bar. She had insulted him in every way possible, let him know just what she thought (to the point where Hikari had felt the need to, rather hesitantly, tell her to pipe down.) She had bothered him on the roof during lunch, well, okay. She had intended to.  
然而，他确实这么做了，他那无形的耶利哥之墙让她几乎要尖叫。于是她试图提高难度。她用尽一切可能的方式侮辱他，让他清楚地知道她的想法（以至于光子都有些犹豫地告诉她，还是收敛点吧。）她本打算在午饭时去屋顶烦他，好吧，她确实打算这么做。

**3**

_Asuka turned and saw... them. She felt her heart skip a beat.  
明日香转身，看到了...他们。她的心跳漏了一拍。_

_There she was, Rei motherfucking Ayanami, the real doll. Her posture was the exact same as his. They were eating. And talking.  
她就在那儿，该死的绫波零，那个真娃娃。她的姿势和他一模一样。他们在吃东西。还在交谈。_

_Since their backs were turned, Asuka took the opportunity to get a bit closer. She wanted to hear what the celluloid toy had to say to the idiot.  
既然他们的背对着，明日香趁机靠近了一些。她想听听那个塑料娃娃要对那个白痴说些什么。_

"_...ordered to."_ "...被命令这么做。"

"_But... why?"_ "但是...为什么？"

"_I can be replaced."_ "我可以被替代。"

"_Don't say that!"_ "别这么说！"

_Asuka clenched her teeth at the tone of his voice – whiny, as always, but a bit too desperate.  
听到他的声音，明日香咬紧了牙关——一如既往的抱怨，但这次显得过于绝望。_

"_It's the truth." Rei said without a hint of emotion._  
"这是事实。" 绫波丽毫无感情地说道。

_A moment of silence. 一片沉默。_

"_Then, I'm expandable as well." Shinji said._  
“那么，我也一样是可以被替代的。”真嗣说道。

_Rei didn't say anything. 绫波没有说话。_

"_They can replace me right now, if they wanted to."_  
"如果他们愿意，现在就可以取代我。"

_Asuka barely caught his next sentence, spoken in a fading whisper.  
明日香几乎没听到他接下来的话，那声音微弱得几乎要消失。_

"_I know that she does."_  
"我知道她会的。"

**4**

The only other time he had ever said anything to her had been to tell her to hurry up after they had been prepared. Well, that, and...  
他唯一一次对她说话，是在他们准备妥当后催她快点。哦，还有……

**5**

"_I hate these tests." Asuka said, "I'd much rather take my EVA out to the staging ground."_  
"我讨厌这些测试。" 明日香说，"我宁愿驾驶我的 EVA 去演练场。"

"_They're mandatory." Rei commented._  
"这是强制性的。" 绫波评论道。"

"_But not the real thing! It's like shooting a gun with no bullets in it to improve aim – it's pointless!"_  
"但不是真货！这就像用没有子弹的枪来练习瞄准——毫无意义！"

_No response from either party.  
双方均无回应。_

"_Not this time." Shinji said._  
"这次不一样。" 真嗣说。

_Asuka ignored him. 明日香无视了他。_

"_I think the diagnostics came in." he continued, "This is a follow-up test to see if the equipment is alright."_  
“我想诊断结果出来了。”他继续说道，“这是为了确认设备是否正常的后续测试。”

_Asuka responded with a noncommittal grunt.  
明日香以一声不置可否的咕哝作为回应。_

"_You should be happy." Shinji said._  
"你应该感到高兴。" 真嗣说。

"_Oh yeah?" she snapped, "And why's that?"_  
"哦，是吗？" 她厉声反问，"那又是为什么呢？"

"_So you were right all along." He said, "I'm just an error. You won."_  
"所以你一直都是对的。" 他说，"我只是个错误。你赢了。"

**4**

Asuka wasn't sure if she had actually won anything. If she did, it didn't feel like it. In fact, despite knowing that what he said was true (as if she could be second to him,) she couldn't help but shirk, however slightly, at his apparent surrender.  
明日香不确定自己是否真的赢了什么。即便赢了，也感觉不到胜利的喜悦。事实上，尽管她知道他说的是真的（仿佛她能屈居于他之下），但面对他明显的投降，她还是忍不住微微退缩。

_How much did you hurt him, Asuka-chan? Maybe you can count backwards from that, see if it stops.  
你到底伤他多深，明日香？或许你可以从那开始倒数，看看是否能停下来。_

Asuka ignored the little voice. Let it chime all it wanted, it didn't matter none.  
明日香无视了那个小声音。让它怎么响都无所谓，反正无关紧要。

**5**

Asuka didn't have time to chide this stupid voice in her head when Ritsuko came in, a chart in her hand. Asuka's face lit up.  
当律子拿着一张图表进来时，明日香没空去责备脑海中那个愚蠢的声音。明日香的脸亮了起来。

"So, what's the status?" she asked sweetly, "How did I do?"  
“那么，情况如何？”她甜甜地问道，“我表现得怎么样？”

"You did just fine." Ritsuko said, "Stellar performance, as always."  
“你表现得很好。”律子说，“一如既往的出色表现。”

"It's a gift." Asuka replied.  
"这是天赋。" 明日香回答道。

"Rei, you've improved slightly, but your rate dropped during the last round. Are you tired?"  
"丽，你有所进步，但上一轮你的速度下降了。你累了吗？"

"No."

"Go to the pharmaceutical section after this, they know what to give you."  
"之后去药房区，他们知道该给你什么。"

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

Asuka glanced at Shinji. His face was unreadable.  
明日香瞥了一眼真嗣。他的表情难以捉摸。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

Shinji stiffened up. 真嗣身体一僵。

"You're staying here." “你留在这里。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow. What?  
明日香挑了挑眉。什么？

"Why?" Shinji asked, "Am I that low?"  
"为什么？" 真嗣问道，"我就那么差劲吗？"

Ritsuko shook her head. Asuka felt confusion set in. What was going on?  
律子摇了摇头。明日香感到一阵困惑。到底发生了什么？

"Misato will contact your school. Unless otherwise told, you'll remain in NERV headquarters for the next seven days."  
"美里会联系你的学校。除非另有通知，否则你将在 NERV 总部待上接下来的七天。"

"What!?" Asuka said, throwing her hands up, "Why?"  
"什么！？" 明日香双手一挥，"为什么？"

Ritsuko sighed. She pulled out a cigarette and lit up.  
律子叹了口气。她掏出一支烟，点燃了。

"What I'm about to say is strictly confidential. Now that you've heard me say that, you are all under a non-disclosure order. Understood? Not a word to anyone who isn't Misato, myself, my lab crew, or higher in rank."  
"我要说的内容是绝密。既然我已经这么说了，你们现在都处于保密命令之下。明白吗？对任何不是美里、我、我的实验室团队或更高级别的人，一个字都不能透露。"

Shinji and Asuka nodded. Rei was still.  
真嗣和明日香点了点头。丽依旧静止不动。

"Shinji, your synchronization ratio was 122%." Ritsuko said, "Under the Commander's orders, you will report to Specalist Miyamoto for intensive combat training, starting tonight. I'll take you."  
“真嗣，你的同步率达到了 122%。”律子说道，“根据司令的命令，你将从今晚开始向宫本专家报到，进行密集战斗训练。我会带你去。”

Asuka froze in place. Her mind did cartwheels and somersaults, trying to cover enough ground to process what was just said on a very basic level.  
明日香僵在原地。她的思绪翻腾跳跃，试图在基本层面上理解刚刚所说的话。

"Why isn't combat training deemed necessary for the other pilots?" Rei asked.  
“为什么其他驾驶员不需要进行战斗训练？”丽问道。

"Thankfully, neither one of you two exceeded the 100% limit. If he pilots with his latest ratio, the EVA will not compensate for much in terms of aiming or other combat functions. Not unless he has a basic grip on fighting. You, specifically," Ritsuko said to Asuka, ", don't need it either way."  
“幸运的是，你们俩都没有超过 100%的限制。如果他以最新的比例驾驶，EVA 在瞄准或其他战斗功能上不会补偿太多。除非他对战斗有基本的掌握。你，特别是你，”律子对明日香说，“无论如何也不需要。”

Asuka didn't know if she wanted to laugh or to scream. It was EVA-101; the Evangelion units compensated for their pilots' lack of movement and actual combat skill with their own internal systems, one of them being auto-aim. Sure, if you pulled instead of squeezing, the kickback shifted the barrel too much and you missed, but the basic function was there. Of course, Evanelions worked not only with their pilots but also _around_ them. Asuka herself could execute more graceful movements and had quicker response because of her high sync ratio – it was her Unit 02 letting her be more in control.  
明日香不知道自己是想笑还是想尖叫。这是 EVA-101；使徒机体通过自身的内部系统弥补了驾驶员缺乏的动作和实际战斗技能，其中之一就是自动瞄准。当然，如果你拉而不是挤压，后坐力会使枪管偏移太多导致你错过目标，但基本功能是存在的。当然，使徒不仅与驾驶员一起工作，还围绕着他们。明日香自己可以执行更优雅的动作并有更快的反应，这得益于她高同步率——是她的 02 号机让她更能掌控局面。

But with something like 122%, it was... would be different. Asuka glanced at Shinji's bandaged knuckles. Yes, the EVA meshed with the pilot, as Asuka's was meshed with her, but she knew that the higher the ratio got, the more feedback the pilot received from the EVA. It cut both ways. Biomechanic uplinking wasn't a one-way street.  
但达到 122%这样的程度，情况就...会截然不同。明日香瞥了一眼真嗣包扎着的手指。是的，EVA 与驾驶员是相互融合的，正如她的 EVA 与她一样，但她知道，同步率越高，驾驶员从 EVA 那里接收到的反馈就越多。这是一把双刃剑。生物机械连接并非单行道。

_This isn't safe... this isn't safe for him. He'll just get hurt. A few blows and he might fall unconscious...  
这太危险了...对他来说太危险了。他会受伤的。几下重击，他可能就会昏过去..._

An image flashed before her eyes. Unit 01, offline, broken on the ground and her, standing there in her EVA, watching an Angel move in for the kill.  
一幅画面在她眼前闪过。初号机，离线，支离破碎地躺在地上，而她，站在自己的 EVA 里，眼睁睁看着使徒逼近，准备给予致命一击。

_Oh, fuck no. Fuck you!  
哦，绝对不行。去你的！_

"You said _if_." Asuka said, almost shaking where she stood, "Did you mean..."  
“你说过如果。”明日香说道，几乎在她站立的地方颤抖，“你是认真的吗……”

"It might be a slightly different value in the field. The synchronization SD is 0.9%, currently. I'd say it'd be around 1 to 2% out there. Further, the error ratio for sync rate is so small, the measurement algorithm refuses to register it properly."  
“在那个领域里，数值可能略有不同。同步率 SD 现在是 0.9%。我估计在外面大约会有 1 到 2%的偏差。而且，同步率误差比率非常小，测量算法都无法准确记录。”

Asuka bit her tongue. 明日香咬住了自己的舌头。

Shinji closed his locker and got his duffel bag. He brushed past Asuka, his shoulder scraping hers, making the hairs on the back of her neck rise, and joined Ritsuko. Asuka could only watch them leave.  
真嗣关上储物柜，拿起他的运动包。他擦过明日香，肩膀轻轻蹭到她，让她后颈的汗毛都竖了起来，然后加入了律子。明日香只能眼睁睁看着他们离开。

Her mouth moved on its own.  
她的嘴巴不由自主地动了起来。

"_Auf Wiedersehen_, boy." "再见，小子。"

**6**

Silence for a few moments, interrupted only by the small noises made by Rei packing the last of her admittedly meager surplus belongings into her duffel bag.  
沉默持续了几分钟，只被丽将自己那点儿确实不多的多余物品最后塞进她的行李袋时发出的轻微声响打断。

Sudden movement alerted Rei. The metallic clang of Asuka's fist slamming on the locker door echoed in the room.  
突然的动静让丽警觉起来。明日香一拳砸在储物柜门上的金属撞击声在房间里回荡。

Rei found that Asuka was trembling. All signs indicated barely-contained rage, bleeding out through her body, trough her clenched teeth and trembling knees. Rei quietly slid the strap of her bag off. She estimated a high chance of physical violence and calling for security would not be a preferable option.  
丽发现明日香在颤抖。所有迹象都表明她正极力压抑着愤怒，这种情绪正通过她紧咬的牙关和颤抖的膝盖渗透出来。丽静静地从肩上滑下书包的带子。她估计发生肢体冲突的可能性很高，而呼叫保安并不是一个理想的选择。

"_Are you fucking kidding me..?_" Asuka snarled.  
“你他妈的在开玩笑吧...？”明日香咆哮道。

Another punch. The locker shook. Another. And another. Rei watched pensively as Asuka laid down blow after blow after blow. After a few, the locker, not built to withstand such an assault, began to cave in. Deciding that she was not needed, Rei picked her bag up.  
又一拳。储物柜晃动了一下。再一拳。又一拳。丽若有所思地看着明日香一拳接一拳地猛击。几拳过后，这个本不耐受如此攻击的储物柜开始凹陷。丽判断自己无需介入，便拾起了书包。

"I'm leaving." She announced.  
"我要走了。" 她宣布道。

"Fucking _go_, already!" Asuka snapped, "What's the point of saying, I'm leaving, when I can see that you are? Nobody cares! I don't care!"  
"赶紧滚吧！" 明日香怒斥道，"你都已经在走了，还说‘我要走了’，有什么意义？没人关心！我不在乎！"

Rei lingered for a few moments before she turned and left.  
绫波留连片刻后，转身离去。

_Good. I've had enough of you. For a lifetime.  
好。我对你已经受够了。一辈子都够了。_

Pain registered on her hands.  
疼痛在她双手中显现。

Asuka couldn't breathe through the mess inside her head. One thought was wrestling for control, trying to reach above all the others, and it was perfectly rational. Perfectly sound. Yes, that thought had to be it. Just had to be, because she had decided that _was_ it, after all.  
明日香无法透过脑海中的混乱呼吸。一个念头在争夺控制权，试图凌驾于其他所有念头之上，它是完全合理的。完美无缺的。是的，那个念头必须就是它。必须如此，因为她毕竟已经决定了那就是它。

Retribution. 报应。

This was his revenge. She had taken away something irreplaceable from him, something precious, and now, he had taken away everything she had in retribution.  
这是他的复仇。她从他那里夺走了无法替代的珍贵之物，如今，他以牙还牙，夺走了她拥有的一切。

_Oh, he didn't take_ shit_! I'm still the Field Commander!_  
哦，他什么也没拿走！我依旧是战场指挥官！

_Asuka-chan, you made that rank up.  
明日香酱，你晋升了那个等级。_

_So what if I did? I have the most experience, I am the one they all count on to know how to do anything! They should have that rank for real, it'd do them a lot of good!  
那又怎样？我经验最丰富，大家都是靠我来知道怎么做事的！他们早该有那个等级了，这对他们大有好处！_

Asuka could feel tears trailing down her cheeks. The thin, liquid lines on her cheeks filled her with revulsion. She scraped them off her cheeks, off her eyes. No. _He_ wouldn't make her cry. She wouldn't break so easily! So what if he'd have training? Unless he could bring it, he wouldn't be able to do anything with it.  
明日香感觉到泪水顺着脸颊滑落。这些细小的液体线条让她感到厌恶。她从脸颊上、从眼睛上抹去它们。不，他不会让她哭的。她不会这么轻易崩溃！就算他有训练又如何？除非他能发挥出来，否则也没什么用。

_And then I'll have to save him, as always. Because sync ratio is nothing. I'm the best they have. I'm the best there is. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best goddamn it, I'm-  
然后我必须像往常一样救他。因为同步率算不了什么。我是他们中最优秀的。我是最好的。我是最好的。我是最好的。该死的，我是——_

"_Shit!"_ “该死！”

**7**

Misato hated the paperwork that went with every little thing they did. She understood the necessity of it just fine, it was part of mapping out their every step, no matter how small, and you never knew when you'd need to back-track. But that shouldn'tve meant an entire binder full of forms to fill out just to retain Shinji for a week. Worse still, she knew that some of these forms were to request other forms. Commander Ikari's no-details-left-behind policy didn't help, either.  
美里讨厌他们做的每一件小事都要填写的文书工作。她很清楚这些文书的必要性，这是规划他们每一步的组成部分，无论多小，你永远不知道何时需要回溯。但这不应该意味着仅仅为了留用真嗣一周就要填满整个活页夹的表格。更糟糕的是，她知道其中一些表格是为了申请其他表格。碇司令的‘不遗漏任何细节’政策也没有帮助。

_Another would-be home night down the dra-  
又一个本该是家的夜晚，就这样被毁了——_

The door of her office was practically bashed open, revealing a slightly out-of-breath Asuka. Misato dropped the pen and leaned back. From the looks of her, it was going to be one of _those_ times. Asuka marched over to her and slammed her hands on the desk, leading Misato to sigh. Yep, one of those times.  
她的办公室门几乎是被撞开的，露出了略显气喘吁吁的明日香。美里放下笔，向后靠了靠。从她的神情来看，这将是那种时刻之一。明日香大步走向她，双手猛地拍在桌上，美里叹了口气。没错，就是那种时刻。

"I want an explanation!" Asuka said.  
“我要一个解释！”明日香说道。

"For what?" Misato asked, cautious to keep her voice even and face neutral.  
"为什么？" 美里问道，小心翼翼地保持声音平稳，面无表情。

"Why is the Third Children is being given special treatment?"  
"为什么第三适格者会受到特殊待遇？"

_Oh, so that's what this is.  
哦，原来如此。_

"He's not. To be honest, I don't want him to go through, either."  
"他不是。老实说，我也不希望他去冒险。"

"Then what's with the special training?"  
"那为什么还要进行特别训练？"

"Asuka, you know that once you go over 100%, it starts to get dangerous. I mean, we've had one incident, and..." she shuddered, "...it wasn't pretty. With the next Angel on the way, anything we can squeeze in would be leagues above nothing."  
"明日香，你知道一旦超过 100%，就开始变得危险了。我是说，我们已经有过一次事故，而且..."她打了个寒颤，"...那场面可不好看。既然下一个使徒就要来了，我们能挤出的任何准备都比什么都不做强得多。"

"Do all adults have this narrow vision?" Asuka asked, "That idiot needs all the help he can get, fluke ratio or no. We all know that. It's obvious that _I_ don't need any extra training, which also goes without saying."  
"难道所有成年人都有这种狭隘的视野吗？" 明日香问道，"那个白痴需要所有他能得到的帮助，不管概率如何。我们都知道这一点。很明显，我不需要额外的训练，这也不言而喻。"

"So it's all okay." Misato said with a wink.  
"所以一切都没问题。" 美里眨了眨眼说。

_Is she this scared that he'll surpass her?  
她是不是害怕他会超越她？_

"No, it isn't. I'm saying that we _all_ should do it – Shinji's not hogging the opportunity. God knows First could stand learn a thing or two!"  
"不，不是这样的。我是说我们都应该这么做——真嗣并没有独占这个机会。天知道一队还能学到一两招呢！"

Misato sighed. Problem was, this was one of those times where she couldn't refute Asuka's logic. She knew that they had withheld such training both due to a lack of time and due to Ritsuko deeming such an endeavor to be further isolating and stressful, two things they didn't want for their pilots. She herself had the basic training. It was drilling, nothing more – nothing had changed since Rome. Apathetic, near-unconscious, focused solely on set boundaries to what they could do – a pilot with full combat training wouldn't engage Shamshel head-on with a nearly tapped out battery. Not without a long-range weapon.  
美里叹了口气。问题是，这次她无法反驳明日香的逻辑。她知道，他们之所以没有进行这种训练，一方面是因为时间不足，另一方面是因为律子认为这样的训练会进一步孤立和增加压力，这是他们不希望给驾驶员带来的。她自己接受过基本的训练。那只是反复练习，没有什么变化——自从罗马事件以来，一切都保持原样。冷漠，近乎无意识，只专注于既定的行动范围——一个接受过全面战斗训练的驾驶员不会在电池几乎耗尽的情况下正面迎战萨姆谢尔。没有远程武器的话，绝不会这样做。

"Alright." Misato said, "I'll ring the Commander, see if this floats. I'm not the one who decides these things. If he gives the go-ahead, then you and Rei will join Shinji."  
"好吧。"美里说，"我会联系司令，看看他是否同意。决定这些事情的人不是我。如果他批准了，那么你和丽就会加入真嗣的训练。"

Asuka smiled triumphantly. She whirled around gracefully and marched out. Misato stared at the stack of papers and sighed deeply.  
明日香得意地笑了。她优雅地转过身，大步走了出去。美里盯着那堆文件，深深地叹了口气。

_Might as well bring the coffee machine in here._
_不如把咖啡机也搬到这里来吧。_

### Chapter 7 Mercenary

**Movement 6 第六乐章  
"Mercenary" “雇佣兵”**

**1**

Specialist Miyamoto Shii was a heavy-set built, imposing man with a stern face and a deep, almost guttural voice. Presently, wearing only the navy blue NERV uniform and his hat held in his hand, he was standing before the impromptu review board, composed of Commander Ikari, Vice Commander Fuyutsuki, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, Major Misato Katsuragi and Kaji, who, despite their wishes to the contrary, was smoking in the nondescript conference room. The review board members had been distributed to the space across the table occupying the room, each of them with a written copy of his official assessment report.  
宫本志雄是一位身材魁梧、面容严肃的男人，声音低沉，几乎带有喉音。此刻，他只穿着深蓝色的 NERV 制服，手中拿着帽子，站在临时组成的审查委员会前。委员会成员包括指挥官碇源堂、副指挥官冬月、赤木律子博士、葛城美里少校以及尽管他们不情愿但仍在无特色的会议室里抽烟的加持。审查委员会成员们分散坐在占据房间的桌子旁，每人手中都有一份他的官方评估报告。

"You may begin." Fuyutsuki said, prompting Miyamoto to speak.  
"可以开始了。" 冬月说道，示意宫本发言。

"You will find the details in the copies before you. The results of the past week are rather... interesting."  
"你们面前的文件里有详细内容。过去一周的结果相当...有意思。"

"That's one way to put it." Kaji said.  
"这么说也行。" 加持说。

"Start with the First Children." Gendo said.  
“从第一适格者开始。”源度说道。

**2**

_The knife had the weight and shape of a regular combat knife with a serrated blade; however, it was, in reality, a trick knife where the blade slid back into the hilt as soon as enough pressure was applied to it.  
这把刀有着普通战斗刀的重量和形状，带有锯齿状的刀刃；然而，实际上它是一把魔术刀，只要施加足够的压力，刀刃就会滑回刀柄中。_

_Miyamoto casually scanned Rei Ayanami. Light build, too pale to be healthy, seemingly pensive and passive, but the past two days had taught him otherwise. She was standing with a solid stance – legs shoulder-length apart, knees slightly bent, shoulders hunched just a bit, knife in one hand, free hand further than the knife, ready to block. Perfect, and an exact duplicate of his own preferred stance.  
宫本随意地打量着绫波零。身材轻盈，肤色过于苍白，显得不太健康，看似沉思且被动，但过去两天让他了解到并非如此。她站立的姿势稳固——双腿与肩同宽，膝盖微屈，肩膀略微耸起，一手握刀，另一只手比刀更远，随时准备格挡。完美，与他自己的偏好姿势如出一辙。_

"_Reverse grip." He instructed. Rei twirled the knife in her hands, her fingers moving with precise motions and held it so. Miyamoto saw her mistake: she was holding the handle adequately, but her thumb was almost locked into the tight grip. Good for slicing, but he had asked for the reversed grip to get a better hold of stabbing. He decided not to warn her, but adjusted his own grip._  
"反手握法。" 他指导道。丽在手中旋转着刀子，手指以精确的动作移动，并这样握住了它。宫本看到了她的错误：她握柄的方式还算合适，但她的拇指几乎紧锁在紧握中。适合切割，但他要求反手握法是为了更好地掌握刺击。他决定不提醒她，而是调整了自己的握法。

"_Go!"_

_Rei sprinted towards him, knife held slightly low. Miyamoto waited, and once she was at arm's reach, jerked forward. Rei slid like fine silk through the opening and slashed with the knife – having seen it coming, Miyamoto shifted to one foot and twirled around, bringing his free arm in and wrapping it around her throat. She attempted to slip down, but Miyamoto's knife had already found a spot between her ribs. Rei stopped instantly.  
丽向他疾跑过去，刀子略微低垂。宫本等待着，当她接近手臂范围时，突然向前一冲。丽如上等丝绸般滑过空隙，挥刀一划——宫本早已预见，单脚一移，旋转身体，空出的手臂顺势绕过她的喉咙。她试图滑下，但宫本的刀已经找到了她肋骨间的空隙。丽立刻停住了动作。_

"_You don't have a straight grip." He told her, "Your goal is to manipulate me into exposing a vulnerable spot, not to cut me open dick to throat. Know what you can do wıth your weapon, know what it can do with the way it's being held."_  
"你的握法不正。" 他告诉她，"你的目标是诱使我暴露弱点，而不是从下至上将我切开。了解你的武器能做什么，了解它在不同握法下的威力。"

"_I understand."_ "我明白了。"

"_Good. Now let's try again."_  
"很好。现在我们再试一次。"

_Rei took her place and came at him again. This time, she feinted forward, prompting Miyamoto to shift, repeating his move, but Rei followed closely, quickly sliding under his arm. Before Miyamoto could react, her knife was already buried to the back of his neck. She pulled the mock weapon back and retreated three steps.  
丽重新站好位置，再次向他发起攻击。这一次，她佯装前冲，引得宫本移动，重复之前的动作，但丽紧随其后，迅速滑至他臂下。宫本还未来得及反应，她的模拟刀已经抵在了他的后颈。她收回假刀，后退三步。_

**3**

"Rei Ayanami has an uncanny ability to adapt. But that's just what it looks like on the outset. In reality, what she does is more akin to synchronizing herself with whoever she's facing. Perfectly."  
"绫波零有着一种不可思议的适应能力。但那只是表面现象。实际上，她所做的是与她面对的任何人同步，完美地。"

"We know." Misato said, "During the attack of the Angel Israfel, she has shown that."  
"我们知道。" 美里说，"在天使伊斯拉斐尔的袭击中，她已经展现出来了。"

Miyamoto nodded. 宫本点头。

"She only needs to be shown a move once, and she can copy it exactly; to the point where if the move is shown incorrectly, she'll also make the mistake."  
"她只需看一次动作，就能精确复制；甚至到了如果动作演示有误，她也会跟着犯错的地步。"

"It says here," Ritsuko said, lighting up a cigarette as well, ", that Rei could avoid a move shown intentionally incorrectly if she was warned beforehand."  
"这里写着，" 律子说着，也点燃了一支烟，", 如果事先得到警告，绫波能够避开故意演示错误的动作。"

"If the warning is descriptive, she can." Miyamoto replied, "If she's just told that the move or maneuver is simply incorrect, she freezes up. Doesn't do anything until the mistake is corrected explicitly."  
"如果警告是描述性的，她可以。" 宫本回答道，"如果只是简单告知动作或机动有误，她就会僵住。不做任何事情，直到错误被明确纠正。"

Fuyutsuki gave a noncommittal nod.  
冬月不置可否地点了点头。

"Move on." Gendo instructed, "Second Children."  
“继续。”碇源堂指示道，“二号适格者。”

Miyamoto sighed. 宫本叹了口气。

"Well, there are some issues where she's concerned..."  
“嗯，她有些问题……”

**4**

_Miyamoto watched from the sidelines as Asuka set Shinji up to knock him down. The poor kid was actually in pretty good form, considering it had only been three days – his technique was good, his drive was admirable and he never managed to stay down. It gave Miyamoto the impression that he just didn't see the point in not getting back up. But, the Specialist had noticed something else, this time with the loud-mouthed, volatile redhead he had been forced to take on – the Second Children was toying with Shinji.  
宫本在旁边观察着，看着明日香把真嗣推倒。考虑到这孩子只练了三天，他的表现其实相当不错——技术扎实，斗志可嘉，而且从不轻易倒下。这让宫本觉得，他似乎就是不明白为什么不起来继续战斗。但这次，专家注意到了另一个问题，那个他不得不接手的、脾气火爆的红发女孩——二号机驾驶员在戏弄真嗣。_

_Shinji would never notice it, of course. Every time he got back up, he took a basic opening stance, eyes narrowed, trying to divine Asuka's moves. He wouldn'tve noticed that Asuka was a master of feints and used a strange, if derivative, version of Jeet Kune Do. Shinji only knew the basics (he could only barely throw a punch when he had first arrived) and as such, was no match. She kept goading him into charging forward, feigning left and striking right, moving circles around him, sometimes letting him land a blow or two just to give him something, before turning the tables on him.  
真嗣当然不会察觉到这一点。每次他站起来，都会摆出基本的起手式，眼神锐利，试图揣摩明日香的动向。他不会注意到明日香擅长虚晃一招，使用一种奇特但源自截拳道的变体。真嗣只懂基础（他刚来时连出拳都勉强），因此根本不是对手。她不断挑衅他向前冲，假装向左实则击右，绕着他转圈，有时让他打中一两下，给他点甜头，然后再反过来压制他。_

_It was a cringe-worthy sight.  
那景象真是让人尴尬得看不下去。_

_The First Children shared his interest, it seemed, watching the Second trip the Third just to throw another taunt his way. Miyamoto noticed that every time Shinji hit the mat, a small muscle on the corner of her lips twitched.  
长子们似乎也对他感兴趣，看着次子绊倒三子，只为再嘲讽他一番。宫本注意到，每次真嗣摔倒在地，她嘴角的一小块肌肉都会微微抽动。_

"_Stay down." Asuka said, breathing heavy, "Yield to me."_  
“别起来了。”明日香喘着粗气说，“向我认输吧。”

_Shinji spun his legs to bring them around, forcing Asuka to take a step back. He rose to his feet, which was when Asuka's elbow collided with his cheek, disrupting his balance. It took only the lightest of pushes to have him on the mat again.  
真嗣转动双腿，将它们甩到一旁，迫使明日香后退一步。他站起身来，就在这时，明日香的肘部击中了他的脸颊，打乱了他的平衡。只需轻轻一推，他就再次倒在了垫子上。_

"_What are you, stupid?" Asuka asked Shinji, before turning to Miyamoto, "You've taught him a few tricks, but he's still not very good."_  
“你是不是傻？”明日香问真嗣，然后转向宫本，“你教了他几招，但他还是不太行。”

"_Not for you, no." Miyamoto said, having been told by Kaji to not argue such points with her, "You are ahead of the class, that's for sure."_  
“对你来说，确实不行。”宫本说，他被加持告诫过不要和她争论这些，“但你肯定是班里最优秀的。”

_Asuka grinned widely. It made Miyamoto shiver.  
明日香咧嘴一笑。这让宫本感到一阵寒意。_

**5**

"There's a reason why she's our top pilot." Misato said, "Despite what the latest tests say. And she has had combat training before all this, so I'm not surprised."  
“她是我们顶尖的驾驶员，这不是没有原因的。”美里说道，“尽管最新的测试结果如此。而且她在这之前就有过实战训练，所以我并不惊讶。”

"She's tough, that's for sure." Kaji said, "If lacking in grace."  
“她确实很强悍，这点毋庸置疑。”加持说，“虽然少了些优雅。”

"I don't even wanna know what you meant by that." Misato grunted.  
"我甚至不想知道你那句话是什么意思。" 美里咕哝道。

"I'm more curious about what you thought I did, but I don't think now is the time." Kaji said, "Maybe later."  
"我更好奇你以为我做了什么，但我觉得现在不是时候。" 加持说，"或许晚点吧。"

Misato rolled her eyes. 美里翻了个白眼。

"Her performance is, as usual, good." Ritsuko commented, "Specialist Miyamoto, you say here that she's effective yet inefficient. Elaborate."  
“她的表现一如既往地好。”律子评论道，“宫本专家，你在这里提到她有效率但效率不高。请详细说明。”

Miyamoto sighed once more.  
宫本再次叹了口气。

"She's too easily distracted. Loses herself too quickly in whatever emotion or warped thought pattern she starts with – it takes under ten seconds for whatever is happening to cease being a mission and begin being whatever she wants it to be."  
“她太容易分心了。一旦陷入某种情绪或扭曲的思维模式，她就会迅速迷失——不到十秒钟，无论发生什么，都会从任务变成她想要的样子。”

"Hardly news." Kaji said, stomping out his cigarette, "Asuka's like that. If she can't have it like she wants to have it, she'll force it."  
"这算不上新闻。" 加持踩灭了烟头，说道，"明日香就是这样。如果事情不能如她所愿，她就会强求。"

"How is that even relevant?" Ritsuko asked, "That's in her psych profile, but we hadn't declared her _inefficient,_ until now."  
"这有什么关联呢？" 律子问道，"她的心理档案里有这些，但我们之前并未判定她效率低下，直到现在。"

"What I meant is that, therefore, she's easy to break." Miyamoto said, "She gets abnormally frustrated at the slightest conceived failure, especially if another person saw it. The tiniest doubt, if it gains a foothold, would break her quickly and easily."  
"我的意思是，正因为如此，她很容易崩溃。" 宫本说，"她对哪怕是最微小的失败也会异常沮丧，尤其是当别人看到时。只要有一丝疑虑扎根，她就会迅速而轻易地崩溃。"

"The Third Children." Gendo said.  
“第三适格者。”源堂说道。

_Shinji gripped his pistol tight. It was like the knives, in that it was the exact shape and weight of a regular weapon, Glock .32, only filled with splatter-darts instead of real bullets. Miyamoto had assured him that the .32 had a softer recoil than a 9mm, his own weapon of choice, but Shinji still felt every shot in his wrist. His aim was less than stellar, lacking the trajectory correction of the EVA, but it was, Miyamoto had offered, far better than any of his new, full-time cadets, barring minor exceptions.  
真嗣紧紧握住手中的手枪。它和那些刀一样，形状和重量都与普通武器无异，是一把格洛克.32 口径的手枪，只不过装填的是散射飞镖而非真子弹。宫本曾向他保证，.32 口径的后坐力比 9 毫米的要小，这是他自己的首选武器，但真嗣仍能感受到每一次射击对手腕的冲击。他的瞄准技术并不出色，缺乏 EVA 那种轨迹修正，但宫本表示，比起他那些新来的全职学员，他的表现已经相当不错了，除了少数例外。_

_The staging ground was just a field of dirt, strewn with sandbags and rugged terrain. There was a building at the end of it, a concrete block with an angled, tin roof. His objective was to reach there without "dying." Shinji crouched behind the first cover he could find, a pile of earth, and checked to see if his safety was off. He felt tired. Moisture had gathered inside his helmet long ago, and his visor was riddled with wet spots.  
演习场地不过是一片布满沙袋和崎岖地形的泥地。尽头有一栋建筑，一个混凝土块，上面覆盖着倾斜的铁皮屋顶。他的任务是毫发无损地到达那里。真嗣蹲在第一个能找到的掩体后，一堆土堆后面，检查了一下保险是否已关闭。他感到疲惫。头盔内早已积聚了湿气，面罩上满是水渍。_

_He picked a different pattern of cover-to-cover running than he had before. In what was the fourth run-through of the same damn exercise, he was determined to satisfy Miyamoto by landing a shot on him... wherever he might be hiding.  
他选择了与以往不同的全书奔跑模式。在这次已经是第四遍重复的该死训练中，他决心要让宫本满意，无论如何都要击中他...无论他可能藏身何处。_

_He stuck out his head to survey the scene. Nothing but him and the distance he had to cross. He adjusted his position, counted to three and darted out of cover. He sprinted towards the first sandbag line, but instead of ducking low, he leapt over it. He darted diagonally across the field, making for a ditch. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something move, and leapt forward, rolled and leapt forward once again. Three shots, and he felt a splatter dart explode against his leg. Once on the ground, he turned on his side and took aim, which was when a second shot found his inner thigh, sending sharp pain up his spine. He aimed and pulled, two shots first, three after that. The darts hit the sandbag line Miyamoto was ducking behind harmlessly. Shinji stayed right where he was, knowing that he'd come out again. He fired again, two, pause, another one to give the impression he was moving behind cover.  
他探出头来观察情况。除了他和需要跨越的距离外，别无他物。他调整了位置，数到三后冲出掩体。他向第一道沙袋线疾跑，但没有低身躲避，而是纵身跃过。他斜穿场地，直奔一条沟渠。眼角余光中，他瞥见有什么东西在动，便向前一跃，翻滚后又再次跃起。三声枪响，他感到一股飞溅的颜料弹击中了他的腿。落地后，他侧身瞄准，就在这时，第二发子弹击中了他的大腿内侧，剧痛直窜脊椎。他瞄准并扣动扳机，先两发，后三发。颜料弹无害地击中了宫本躲藏的沙袋线。真嗣原地不动，知道他还会再出来。他又开了枪，两发，停顿，再一发，给人他在掩体后移动的错觉。_

_When Miyamoto sprang up, gun in hand, Shinji emptied the clip, managing to land three of the remaining seven shots, two on his chest, but not before Miyamoto also managed to clip him in the stomach. Shinji lifted the empty gun into the air to signal that he was done. Miyamoto moved out of cover and came up to him. He took off his helmet, and Shinji did the same.  
当宫本跃起，手持枪械时，真嗣迅速清空弹匣，成功命中剩余七发子弹中的三发，其中两发击中宫本的胸膛，但在宫本也成功击中他腹部之前。真嗣将空枪举向空中，示意自己已无子弹。宫本从掩体中走出，向他走来。他摘下头盔，真嗣也照做。_

"_You failed." Miyamoto said._  
“你失败了。”宫本说道。

"_I failed!?" Shinji breathed hard, pointing at the Specialist's chest, "Aren't you dead?"_  
“我失败了！？”真嗣喘着粗气，指向专家的胸膛，“难道你没死吗？”

"_I didn't say you didn't kill me." Miyamoto said, offering a hand. He helped Shinji stand up, "But by a ballpark estimate, you died shortly after that last shot. You never made it to the warehouse."_  
"我没说你没杀我。" 宫本说，伸出手来。他帮助真嗣站起来，"但粗略估计，你在那最后一枪后不久就死了。你根本没到仓库。"

"_How?"_ “怎么？”

_Miyamoto pointed at his thigh.  
宫本指着自己的大腿。_

"_Femoral artery. You're bleeding out, and fast._ _Why didn't you get to cover?"_  
"股动脉。你正在大量失血，而且很快。为什么不去掩护？"

"_I thought I'd wait for you to make a move."_  
"我以为我会等你先行动。"

"_You could've gotten off with a leg wound if you had scrambled."_  
"如果你当时爬开了，可能只会受点腿伤。"

_Shinji just glared at him.  
真嗣只是瞪着他。_

"_I succeeded this way, too." He insisted._  
"我也这样成功了。" 他坚持道。

**7**

"Permission to speak freely?"  
"可以自由发言吗？"

Fuyutsuki nodded. 冬月点了点头。

"He shouldn't be piloting. In fact, he should be having his head examined."  
"他不该驾驶 EVA。实际上，他应该去检查一下脑子。"

"What?" Misato asked, raising an eyebrow, "Why?"  
"什么？" 美里皱起眉头，"为什么？"

"Far as aptitude goes, Shinji Ikari is more than anyone is willing to give him credit for, not least of all himself. He's adaptable, learns quickly, is goal-oriented and a good improviser. What he isn't, is sane."  
"就能力而言，碇真嗣远比人们愿意给予他的评价要高，尤其是他自己。他适应性强，学得快，目标明确且善于即兴发挥。但他缺乏的，是理智。"

"Explain." Gendo said. "解释一下。" 碇司令说。

"He has absolutely no regard for self-preservation. He's not suicidal, Dr. Akagi," he added hastily, seeing her turn pages in her copy, ", because I have seen what suicidal looks like. It's more like he doesn't care, or quite fully understand what it means to be KIA."  
"他完全没有自我保护意识。他不是自杀性的，赤木博士，" 他急忙补充道，看到她在自己的副本中翻页，"，因为我见过什么是自杀性的。他更像是不在乎，或者不太完全理解成为 KIA 意味着什么。"

"This is new." Ritsuko said, "Elaborate, please."  
"这是新的情况。" 律子说，"请详细说明。"

"He has no defense. In hand-to-hand, he never dodges, blocks or parries. He maneuvers if he sees that his lack of defense will get him killed, but that's only to rewind so he can attack again. He doesn't avoid killing blows to avoid them... he treats them like an impediment, no more serious than a roadblock."  
"他没有防御。在近身战中，他从不会闪避、格挡或招架。如果他意识到缺乏防御会让他丧命，他会采取行动，但那只是为了倒带以便再次攻击。他并不回避致命打击来避免它们...他把它们视为障碍，不比路障更严重。"

"That, to me, indicates a survival instinct." Ritsuko said, "Then again, it also indicates the lack thereof."  
"对我来说，这表明了一种生存本能。" 赤木律子说，"不过，这也表明了缺乏这种本能。"

Miyamoto shook his head. 宫本摇了摇头。

"Let me rephrase that. He behaves like a killing blow or a mortal wound should be avoided only and only if he knows it'll keep him from reaching his goal, and that it doesn't matter otherwise."  
"让我换个说法。他的行为就像是在避免致命一击或致命伤，前提是他知道这会阻碍他达成目标，否则就无所谓。"

**8**

_Shinji hit the mat again. He was getting used to the feeling of being thrown off his feet. He had gotten used to how people looked from where he was, especially Asuka. Presently, she had her foot on his chest, and a wooden practice staff at his throat.  
真嗣再次摔倒在垫子上。他已经开始习惯这种被摔出去的感觉了。他也习惯了从自己的位置看人们的模样，尤其是明日香。此刻，她的脚踩在他的胸口，一根木制练习杖抵在他的喉咙上。_

"_Shinji." Miyamoto said as Asuka withdrew the lance, but not her foot, "Why do you let her do this?"_  
"真嗣。" 宫本说，明日香收回了长矛，但脚并未移开，"你为什么让她这样做？"

"_Because I beat him." Asuka said._  
"因为我打败了他。" 明日香说道。

"_I asked him." Miyamoto said, "She killed you."_  
"我问过他了。" 宫本说，"她杀了你。"

"_It's a sparring match." Shinji said._  
"这只是一场练习赛。" 真嗣说。

"_Okay, get up."_ “好了，站起来。”

_Asuka reluctantly stepped back, letting Shinji get to his feet and recover his own staff.  
明日香不情愿地退后，让真嗣站起身来，拿回自己的竹剑。_

"_Alright." Miyamoto said, "Shinji. Survive for fifteen seconds."_  
“好吧。”宫本说，“真嗣，坚持十五秒。”

_Asuka immediately took her opening stance, prompting Shinji to return the gesture. Miyamoto reset his stopwatch.  
明日香立刻摆出起手式，敦促真嗣也做出回应。宫本重置了他的秒表。_

"_Go!"_

_He clicked. Asuka immediately came at him, swinging her staff in a wild, horizontal arc in attempt to force him back. Shinji ducked under it and came from the opposite direction, and managed to land a hit. In the sixth second, Asuka leapt back, bringing the slightly pointy end to bear and feinted left. Shinji reacted by preparing to parry. Ten seconds had passed when Asuka took a strong jab forward, which Shinji barely managed to avoid by side-stepping rather clumsily. Asuka came at full-force, swinging the blunt end, which Shinji blocked.  
他按下按钮。明日香立刻向他发起攻击，挥舞着她的长棍，试图以一个狂野的水平弧线迫使他后退。真嗣低头躲过，从相反方向反击，并成功击中。第六秒时，明日香向后跳跃，将稍尖的一端对准并佯装向左。真嗣准备格挡作为回应。十秒过去，明日香猛地向前刺去，真嗣勉强通过笨拙的侧步避开。明日香全力出击，挥动钝端，被真嗣挡下。_

"_Fifteen!" Miyamoto called._  
“十五！”宫本喊道。

_Asuka rewound the staff as Shinji regained his footing and thrust forward once again. Shinji saw it coming, and Miyamoto saw that he had enough time for a parry. He didn't. He let her "impale" him, doubled over from the pain, which was when Asuka used the blunt end to tripped him.  
明日香将剑向后一撤，真嗣重新站稳并再次向前刺去。真嗣预见到了这一击，宫本也看出他有足够时间进行格挡。但他没有。他任由她“刺中”自己，因疼痛而弯下腰，就在这时明日香用钝端将他绊倒。_

_Miyamoto looked at the stopwatch. He had lasted three seconds after his objective was up.  
宫本看着秒表。他的目标达成后坚持了三秒钟。_

**9**

"In short, Shinji Ikari is not suitable to be an EVA pilot." Miyamoto said, "Not the state that he's in. And Major Katsuragi, pardon me for saying so, but... if this were a different time, he'd make a prefect kamikaze pilot."  
“简而言之，碇真嗣不适合担任 EVA 驾驶员。”宫本说道，“以他目前的状态来看。而且葛城少校，请恕我直言，但……如果是在不同的时代，他绝对是个完美的神风特攻队飞行员。”

Misato felt a lump in her throat. She could only stare at the report in her hands, but every sentence written on the page (actually outlining Shinji's strangely outstanding accuracy with firearms, despite a slightly higher-than-normal margin of slipping due to the force of the weapon recoil) seemed to spell out her own failure. It was outlining how she had managed to fuck up being Shinji's guardian. It was detailing how she had failed to even attempt to blunt Asuka's sharper tendencies, how, in the course of just three days, she had managed to get lost in the fucking paperwork.  
美里感到喉咙哽咽。她只能盯着手中那份报告，但每一句话（实际上是在描述真嗣在射击方面异常出色的准确性，尽管由于武器后坐力的影响，他的失误率略高于正常水平）似乎都在宣告她自己的失败。这正是在阐述她是如何搞砸了作为真嗣监护人的职责。这详细说明了她是如何未能尝试缓和明日香更为尖锐的倾向，如何在短短三天内，她就迷失在那该死的文书工作中。

_He's picking fights and doesn't care if he dies; she's hell-bent on showing how much better she is... we are supposed to look to them to defend us, and I was supposed to be their guardian. And what the fuck am I guarding them from?  
他挑起争斗，不在乎自己是否会死；她则一心要展示自己有多优秀……我们本应指望他们来保护我们，而我本应是他们的监护人。我他妈的在保护他们免受什么伤害？_

"That'll be all, Specialist." Fuyutsuki said, nodding, "Thank you for your hard work."  
“就这样吧，专家。”冬月点头说道，“感谢你的辛勤工作。”

Miyamoto saluted them. He turned on one foot and marched out of the room. A few moments of silence ensued. Kaji was the first to get up.  
宫本向他们敬了个礼。他单脚转身，大步走出了房间。片刻的沉默随之而来。加持是第一个站起来的。

"Well, it's official. Our pilots are hanging by a thread."  
“好吧，情况正式明确了。我们的驾驶员们正命悬一线。”

"Not necessarily." Ritsuko said. She leaned back on her chair, "His findings are in line with their earlier evaluations. The only thing that seems to have changed is in Shinji."  
“未必如此。”律子说道。她向后靠在椅背上，“他的发现与他们早先的评估一致。唯一看似有所变化的，是真嗣。”

### Chapter 8 LCYD

**Movement 7 第七乐章  
"LCYD" LCYD**

**1**

The scent of home was sweeter than he remembered. Carpeting, walls, the wooden frames of doors, the moist aroma of PenPen, the sharp and bitter taste of beer. Familiarity, it seemed, was not just in remembering what this strange combination smelled, but also in what it signified. Shinji took off his shoes.  
家的气息比他记忆中的还要甜美。地毯、墙壁、木质的门框、PenPen 湿润的香气，还有啤酒那尖锐苦涩的味道。熟悉感，似乎不仅仅在于记得这种奇特组合的气味，还在于它所象征的意义。真嗣脱下了鞋子。

"I'm home." He said to nobody in particular. It only seemed right.  
"我回来了。" 他对着空无一人的房间说道，这似乎再自然不过了。

"It's your own damn house, dummy; and nobody's in, anyway!"  
"这可是你自己的破房子，傻瓜；反正也没人在家！"

That voice. 那个声音。

Shinji clenched his teeth, shouldered his duffel bag and headed for his room. He opened the door, got in, and closed it. He hated that the doors didn't have locks. He hated that he had to agree with Asuka on that. He hated it more that he could actually admit that. He despised it, absolutely fucking despised it.  
真嗣咬紧牙关，扛起他的旅行袋，朝自己的房间走去。他打开门，走进去，然后关上门。他讨厌这些门没有锁。他讨厌自己不得不在这点上同意明日香。他更讨厌自己居然能承认这一点。他鄙视它，绝对他妈的鄙视它。

Absolutely despised her. 绝对鄙视她。

Shinji threw himself onto his bed and curled up in a ball. He could hear the noises in the living room and beyond. The rattling sound of a door sliding open. The frump of her duffel bag hitting the ground. The ambient hum of the city just outside his window – distant, faint echoes of cars, people and conversations in high volume, the hot wind scraping the concrete exterior of buildings... the cloth of his drapes, gently moving, sliding on the windowpane... the crunching and scraping of cloth from the bed sheets, his shirt... his heart in his ears, his breath wheezing out...  
真嗣一头栽倒在床上，蜷缩成一团。他能听到客厅和更远处的声响。门滑开时的嘎吱声。她的旅行袋落地时的砰然声。窗外城市的背景嗡鸣——遥远的、微弱的汽车、人群和高声交谈的回响，热风刮擦着建筑的混凝土外墙……窗帘的布料轻轻摆动，滑过窗玻璃……床单、衬衫的摩擦声……耳中的心跳，呼吸的喘息声……

_So much noise. Too much.  
如此嘈杂，太过分了。_

"Ah, Scheiße!" “啊，该死！”

_Shut up. 闭嘴。_

Shinji closed his eyes. There was a song in his head, a song that wouldn't go away. It reminded him of the intersection. He couldn't recall what the name of the song was, but he knew that it was Track 25.  
真嗣闭上了眼睛。脑海中有一首歌挥之不去，它让他想起了那个十字路口。他记不清这首歌的名字，但他知道那是第 25 轨。

**2**

Asuka threw the duffel bag in its entirety into the clothes hamper. She couldn't be asked to go through that particular disgusting mess, item by item. No way. She would take a shower, however. The Japanese loved their baths, but a shower was quicker and not any less clean. She stripped off her school uniform, and hung it from the doorknob. NERV had seen to it that it was cleaned, and there was no need for a do-over.  
明日香将整个旅行袋一股脑儿扔进了洗衣篮。她可没耐心一件件清理那堆恶心玩意儿，绝不可能。不过，她打算洗个澡。日本人喜欢泡澡，但淋浴更快，同样干净。她脱下校服，挂在门把手上。NERV 已经安排清洗过了，没必要再洗一遍。

Standing under the running water reminded her just how well NERV trained their operatives. She wouldn't say it out loud, never, but she had barely managed to get through it. At least it had been interesting, and she had learned some useful things (how to clear a bullet jamming up the slide, for instance) and had gotten to fuck with Shinji.  
站在流水下，她不禁想起 NERV 对特工的训练有多么严格。她绝不会大声说出来，永远不会，但她几乎没能撑过去。至少那挺有意思，还学到了些实用的东西（比如如何排除卡壳的子弹），而且还能捉弄真嗣。

_Now why does it have to even go there?  
现在为什么非得扯到那儿去呢？_

_Asuka-chan, for someone who keeps calling him an idiot, what do you think you are?  
绫波酱，你老是叫他白痴，那你觉得自己又是什么呢？_

_Oh, fuck you! 哦，去你的！_

Through the hissing of the water, she heard the apartment door open and close.  
透过水流的嘶嘶声，她听到公寓的门开了又关。

**3**

"You're in my spot." “你占了我的位置。”

Shinji didn't know how long he had been in the park. He had taken off as soon as Asuka had jumped into shower, but knowing that he had to be back home for, and more likely to make, dinner, he had only gone so far as this now-familiar place. He had sat on the first bench, and until he had heard Asuka's voice, he hadn't even been aware of anything – not the sun setting, not the screeching of cicadas, nothing but the thought that for the first time since this whole thing had started, the EVA was appearing more and more like a blessing.  
真嗣不知道自己在公园里待了多久。他一看到明日香冲进浴室就立刻离开了，但知道他必须回家做晚饭——更有可能是为了做晚饭——他只走到了这个现在已经很熟悉的地方。他坐在第一条长椅上，直到听到明日香的声音，他才意识到任何事情——没有注意到太阳落山，没有听到蝉的尖叫声，除了一个念头：自从这一切开始以来，EVA 的出现越来越像是一种祝福。

"I didn't know it was yours. I'll leave."  
"我不知道这是你的。我走。"

"No. I'm feeling generous this evening. I'll allow you to stay. Scoot over."  
"不。今晚我心情好。我允许你留下。挪过去点。"

Asuka sat down next to him, squeezing into the corner of the bench, as far away from him as possible. She looked at her shoes. The black pair. Her fair skin was made more apparent by the color, and she liked the single strap around her ankle.  
明日香在他旁边坐下，挤到长椅的角落，尽可能离他远些。她看着自己的鞋子。那双黑色的。她的白皙肌肤在黑色衬托下更显眼，她喜欢脚踝上那条单带。

She glanced over her shoulder. Shinji was just sitting there, looking at the bench on the other side of the park. At first she thought he was in a trance, vacant eyes staring off...  
她回头瞥了一眼。真嗣就坐在那里，望着公园另一边的长椅。起初她以为他陷入了恍惚，空洞的眼睛凝视着远方……

_Come on, Asuka-chan. Don't be shy now.  
来吧，明日香。别害羞了。_

Asuka turned away. 明日香转过身去。

_What does that have to do with anything?  
那和这有什么关系？_

_Say something. 说点什么吧。_

_I'm too tired to be bothered.  
我太累了，懒得理会。_

_Excuses, excuses. You broke it, now buy it.  
借口，借口。你弄坏了，现在就得买。_

_Shut up. 闭嘴。_

She felt exhausted. She couldn't deny that just sitting here was slowly draining away the energy that 2-hour power nap had done nothing to restore. She was sore from her head to her toes. Every major muscle group was seized up; remnants of an intense week. She almost wished she hadn't gone through with it – the price of learning one or two new tricks should not have been this senseless fatigue.  
她感到筋疲力尽。她无法否认，仅仅坐在这里就慢慢消耗掉了那个两小时的小憩所未能恢复的精力。她从头到脚都酸痛不已。每一块主要肌肉群都紧绷着；这是紧张一周的余波。她几乎希望自己没有坚持下去——学会一两个新技巧的代价不应该是这种无谓的疲惫。

He seemed unaffected, which she failed to fully grasp. Miyamoto's primary cadet had been him, and the specialist had driven him harder than he had her or Rei. And maybe it was her body begging for rest, maybe it was the anticipation, but her tongue was suddenly loose.  
他似乎毫不在意，这让她难以完全理解。宫本的首席学员曾是他，而专家对他的要求比对她或丽都要严格。或许是她的身体在渴望休息，或许是那份期待，她的舌头突然变得松懈。

"Say, Shinji..." “说起来，真嗣……”

No response. 没有回应。

"What do you think the next Angel will be like?"  
“你觉得下一个使徒会是什么样子？”

Silence. 沉默。

_Come on, you idiot, say something!  
快点，你这个笨蛋，说点什么吧！_

"I don't care." Shinji said.  
"我不在乎。" 真嗣说。

"You're not curious?" "你不好奇吗？"

"No."

"Well, I am. Hope it's not as annoying as the twins."  
"嗯，我是。希望不会像那对双胞胎一样烦人。"

No response. 没有回应。

_Screw this. 去他的。_

"What does it feel like?" Shinji asked.  
"那是什么感觉？" 真嗣问道。

"What does what feel like?"  
“什么感觉？”

"Being special." “与众不同。”

**4**

Asuka's eyes widened. Coming out of the left field, the question had disarmed her completely. She could almost physically feel her frustration dissolving. This was not in the script. It had caught her off-guard, and in that moment, Asuka shirked from him, shrunk from his apparent envy. Her jaw felt like it had been wired shut.  
明日香的眼眸睁大了。这个突如其来的问题完全打乱了她的阵脚。她几乎能实实在在地感受到自己的挫败感在消散。这不在剧本之中。它让她措手不及，那一刻，明日香从他明显的羡慕中退缩了，仿佛在他面前缩小了身形。她的下巴感觉像是被焊死了。

Shinji didn't repeat the question.  
真嗣没有重复那个问题。

"I... don't know." Asuka managed, meekly. When Shinji didn't respond or move, she continued, "I guess I don't know being any other way. I couldn't tell you."  
"我...不知道。" 明日香勉强回答，显得有些温顺。见真嗣没有回应或移动，她继续说道，"我想我不知道还能有其他方式。我无法告诉你。"

"Of course not." "当然不能。"

Asuka couldn't help but notice that he was clenching his right hand into a fist, releasing, clenching it again. He didn't seem to be doing it consciously, as he was just staring at his hands now.  
明日香不禁注意到他正无意识地紧握右拳，松开，又再次握紧。他似乎并未意识到自己在这样做，只是呆呆地盯着双手。

"I didn't get into a fight that night." He said.  
“那晚我没有打架。”他开口道。

She felt a shudder, but suppressed it. He was acting downright strange, even by his standards.  
她感到一阵颤栗，却强压下去。他的行为异常得离谱，甚至超出了他平时的古怪程度。

"Then why didn't you tell the truth?"  
"那为什么你不讲真话？"

"I didn't need to. Everyone knew."  
"我不需要。大家都知道。"

"If they knew, they wouldn'tve spread the story, dummy."  
"如果他们知道，就不会传播那个故事了，傻瓜。"

"It was Toji. He wanted to do me a favor. They just went with it."  
"那是冬二。他想帮我个忙。他们就顺其自然了。"

"And you let it slide because it made you look like a badass..." Asuka clenched her teeth, "You're _impossible._"  
"而你放任不管，因为这让你看起来像个硬汉……"" 明日香咬紧牙关，""你真是无可救药。"

"They all knew it wasn't true. Why say what was already obvious?"  
"他们都知道这不是真的。为什么还要说那些显而易见的事？"

"You have an excuse for everything."  
"你总有借口。"

Shinji was still for a few moments, his right hand clenched tight. He released his fingers slowly. Asuka bit her lip.  
真嗣静止了几秒钟，右手紧握成拳。他缓缓松开手指。明日香咬了咬嘴唇。

"I believed it." She said, "I mean, it was completely ridiculous, but the way you walked out, I could stretch to believe you had beaten a random citizen to a bloody pulp."  
"我相信了。" 她说，"我是说，那完全荒谬，但你那样走出去，我几乎要相信你把一个无辜市民打得血肉模糊了。"

"...like you cared." "...就像你在乎一样。"

"_Don't pretend I'm good enough."_  
"别假装我够好了。"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

_Shinji, what? What!? 真嗣，什么？什么！？_

"It's not... easy." She said, "I'm not easy sometimes. That doesn't mean..." _It doesn't mean I'm a hard, chrome bitch._ "It doesn't mean that. I mean, I don't hate you or anyt-"  
"这并不...容易。" 她说，"我有时并不容易相处。但这并不意味着..." 并不意味着我是个冷酷无情的婊子。"这并不意味着那样。我是说，我并不讨厌你或者任何——"

Shinji burst out laughing. Asuka wasn't sure if she should start getting scared, or be offended. He sat there, his humorless laughter echoing through the open space, making the shadows made by the fading sunlight more apparent with its lifelessness. Asuka shivered. For the first time since she had smashed the SDAT player, she was feeling something akin to (as she'd never go all the way with him) fear.  
真嗣突然爆发出笑声。明日香不确定自己是应该开始感到害怕，还是应该感到被冒犯。他就那样坐着，毫无笑意的笑声在空旷的空间中回荡，使得夕阳投下的阴影因其无生气而更加明显。明日香打了个寒颤。自从她砸碎了 SDAT 播放器以来，她第一次感受到了类似于（尽管她绝不会完全接受他）恐惧的情绪。

"Liar." Shinji said. "骗子。" 真嗣说。

Full stop. His voice was ice cold.  
完全沉默。他的声音冷若冰霜。

"All you ever do is hurt me." Shinji said, "All you ever do is push me around, push me away, shut me out. You couldn't even leave me alone during the training. And why did you even follow me down? Why were you even there?"  
“你总是伤害我。”真嗣说，“你总是推开我，把我赶走，把我关在外面。你甚至在训练时也不让我安宁。你为什么要跟着我下来？你为什么会在那里？”

Asuka couldn't answer. 明日香无法回答。

"You don't hate me?" he chuckled, "You _despise_ me, and that's when you barely care that I exist. You made sure I knew at least that much."  
"你不恨我吗？" 他轻笑道，"你鄙视我，那还是在你几乎不在乎我存在的时候。你确保我至少知道这一点。"

"I don't..." _I don't always know how to._  
"我不……" 我并不总是知道如何表达。"

"No." Shinji snarled, "You say that now, but five minutes from now, if even that, you'll show me again. You just want me to forget, so it'll be like nothing happened."  
"不。" 真嗣咆哮道，"你现在这么说，但五分钟后，甚至可能不到，你就会再次向我展示。你只是想让我忘记，这样就好像什么都没发生过。"

_Why do I feel like I could...  
为什么我感觉自己可以..._

_Because he's right, Asuka-chan.  
因为他是对的，明日香。_

"I know that I'm just another pilot." He said, "The Third Children... children, not child, because I can be replaced. I'm expandable."  
“我知道我只是另一个驾驶员。”他说，“第三适格者...是复数，不是单数，因为我可以被替换。我是可有可无的。”

"Fucking Wondergirl... you're talking like her! Just like her!"  
"该死的奇迹女孩...你说话的口气跟她一模一样！就像她一样！"

"Isn't it true? And what does it matter? Wouldn't you be happy if I was dead? Or satisfied? Wouldn't everyone?"  
"难道不是吗？这有什么关系？如果我死了，你不会高兴吗？或者满意？大家不都是这么想的吗？"

"I-"

"The Angel's just a little more than a day away. With any luck, we'll kill it, and I'll get myself killed in the process, like everyone thinks I will... I'm tired of others constantly saving me."  
"天使号离我们只有一天多的距离了。如果运气好的话，我们会摧毁它，而我也会在过程中丧命，就像大家认为的那样...我厌倦了别人不断地救我。"

Shock had arrested her jaw, she couldn't speak, say something, _anything_...  
震惊让她无法言语，她张不开口，说不出任何话，任何...

"Maybe then, finally," he said, ", you'll be _happy_ for something I did."  
"也许那时，终于，" 他说，"你会因为我做的事而感到高兴。"

**5**

Shinji stood up. He lurched forward, to take a step.  
真嗣站起身来。他踉跄向前，迈出一步。

"...I tried to fix it."  
"...我试图修复它。"

Shinji stopped to look at her. She was facing away from him. Her hands were holding handfuls of her dress.  
真嗣停下来看着她。她背对着他。她的双手紧抓着裙摆。

"I couldn't. It was too broken." Asuka swallowed hard, there seemed to be a lump in her throat, "I just don't how to fix it... I didn't know what it was. Honestly. If I had known..."  
"我做不到。它太破碎了。" 明日香艰难地咽了咽，喉咙里似乎有块硬物，"我就是不知道怎么修复它...我不知道它是什么。老实说。如果我早知道..."

"No."

Asuka retreated further. 明日香退得更远了。

"I don't know what I did wrong," Shinji said, ", but I always do everything wrong, don't I? You didn't even _care_ what it was. It was mine, and that was enough. I had it, I've always had it..." his voice began to quiver, "...it was the only thing. _The only thing and you-"_  
“我不知道我做错了什么，”真嗣说，“但我总是做错一切，不是吗？你甚至不在乎那是什么。那是我的，仅此一点就够了。我拥有它，我一直以来都拥有它……”他的声音开始颤抖，“……那是唯一的东西。唯一的东西，而你——”

Asuka's voice was barely a whisper. Shinji listened in as she repeated it.  
明日香的声音几乎细不可闻。真嗣聆听着，她重复着那句话。

"...I didn't mean to." She said.  
"...我不是故意的。" 她低声说道。

Shinji couldn't respond. When she looked up at him, all she saw was pure shock.  
真嗣无法回应。当她抬头看向他时，她看到的只有纯粹的震惊。

"I didn't know it would be this way." Asuka continued, straining with the effort, "I was angry, and I..." _wanted to hurt you... no. I wanted to see you hurt. I wanted to know I could do that to you. And I guess I can... or could._ "...I didn't mean it. What I said." _I'm afraid to care any more than I do. I don't want to be dependent on you that way. I don't want to be defined by you._ "You're not expandable." _I'm not expandable._  
"我不知道会变成这样。" 明日香继续说道，努力克制着自己的情绪，"我当时很生气，我..." 想要伤害你...不。我想看到你受伤。我想知道我能对你做那种事。我想我确实能...或者曾经能。"...我不是有意的。我说的那些话。" 我害怕再在乎你更多。我不想以那种方式依赖你。我不想被你定义。"你不是可有可无的。" 我不是可有可无的。

"Stop it." "住手。"

"You..." her jaw tensed up. She shrugged it off, "You're a fucking idiot. You'll get yourself killed at this rate. And..." _What would I do if you died? What would I do if I couldn't prevent it? I'm the one who has to save you – what would I do if I couldn't?_ "...I don't want you to die." _I don't want you to disappear._ "I don't hate you." _Don't hate me._ "I don't despise you." _Don't despise me._ "Just..." _Don't shut me out. Don't push me away. Look at me – I'm right here, in front of you._  
"你……"" 她的下巴紧绷起来。她耸耸肩，试图摆脱这种情绪，""你真是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。照这样下去，你会把自己害死的。而且……"" 如果你死了，我该怎么办？如果我无法阻止这一切，我该怎么办？我是那个必须救你的人——如果我做不到，我该怎么办？""……我不想你死。"" 我不想你消失。""我不恨你。"" 别恨我。""我不鄙视你。"" 别鄙视我。""只是……"" 别把我拒之门外。别推开我。看着我——我就在你面前。

_Don't you want to..? 你难道不想……？_

Misato had barely gotten comfortable in one of her designated home outfits (simple short and top combo, as usual) when the doorbell rang. She remembered that Rei, after getting some basic stuff from her house, was supposed to stay over, to avoid any commuting confusion on the eve of the next Angel attack. Misato went through the living room, but on her way to the doorway, a sharp pain gripped her left foot. The next step brought more pain, so she leaned against the wall and inspected her sole.  
Misato 刚换上她惯常的家居装（一如既往的短裤和上衣组合），门铃就响了。她记得 Rei 从家里拿了些基本物品后，应该会留宿一晚，以免在下次使徒袭击前夕出现通勤混乱。Misato 穿过客厅，但在走向门口的路上，她的左脚突然一阵剧痛。下一步更是痛上加痛，她只好靠在墙上，检查自己的脚底。

A very thin strip of metal had pierced through her foot. She saw that it wasn't like a pin – what had stopped it from going in completely was that the piece looped thrice after that, and extended another piercing piece. A spring, then. Misato held it between two fingers and gently pulled it out. She straightened up, on the tips of the toes of her left foot, and inspected it closely. A tiny, yet, as she felt it, sharp spring.  
一根非常细的金属条刺穿了她的脚。她发现这不像别针——之所以没有完全刺入，是因为那部分在刺入后绕了三圈，并延伸出另一段尖锐的部分。原来是个弹簧。Misato 用两根手指夹住它，轻轻拔了出来。她踮起左脚尖，仔细检查。虽然微小，但感觉异常尖锐的弹簧。

_Now, where did this come from?  
这东西是从哪儿来的？_

She stuck it in her pocket and went to the door. Part of her wondered where Shinji and Asuka were.  
她把它塞进口袋，走向门口。她的一部分思绪在想，真嗣和明日香在哪里。

**7**

For Shinji, the walk back was rather nondescript.  
对真嗣来说，走回家的路相当平淡无奇。

Her face, sad, apologetic, contorted in a way he had never seen before, kept flashing in his mind. She looked so... vulnerable. It followed him up the road, hanging in the void like a painting of tragedy.  
她的脸，悲伤、抱歉，扭曲成他从未见过的样子，不断在他脑海中闪现。她看起来如此……脆弱。这幅景象伴随着他走上小路，像一幅悲剧画作般悬挂在虚空中。

_Why did you look so... naked?  
为什么你看起来那么... 赤裸裸的？_

**7**

For Asuka, the walk back was a flurry of details, flooding every single step, straining the levy. More than anything, his silence allowed for that other voice, sounding precariously more like her own, to run circles around her. She was still hyper-aware of his presence right beside her, but was at a loss as to what that meant, what he meant. Why was she so fixated on him? About a week and a half ago, she wouldn't take one word of it lying down.  
对于明日香来说，走回家的路上是一片混乱的细节，每一步都充斥着，冲击着堤坝。最重要的是，他的沉默让另一个声音，听起来越来越像她自己的声音，在她周围打转。她仍然极度意识到他就在她身边，但却不知道这意味着什么，他意味着什么。为什么她如此专注于他？大约一周半以前，她绝不会对此屈服。

Part of her was impressed. Sure, he still was the mopey dolt he always was, but a week and a half ago, he would not have called her out but apologized by reflex instead.  
她的一部分感到佩服。当然，他仍然是那个总是闷闷不乐的傻瓜，但一周半以前，他不会指出她的错误，而是会本能地道歉。

_Of course, he would not have dared, back then. He didn't have his wound.  
当然，那时候他不敢这么做。他没有他的伤口。_

**8**

Misato was on the phone, which left it for Rei to answer the door when it rang. Asuka reacted with apprehension, but Shinji found himself pleasantly surprised that she had come earlier than he had anticipated. Rei, her usual, distant self, intoned a "welcome home" before returning to the living room. Asuka scowled at her as she undid the straps of her shoes. She could hear Misato talking on the phone, and while she didn't pay attention to the words, she caught her tone of voice.  
美里正在打电话，于是门铃响起时由绫波来应门。明日香显得有些紧张，但真嗣却意外地感到高兴，因为她比他预想的来得早。绫波依旧保持着她那疏离的态度，淡淡地说了声“欢迎回家”，然后回到客厅。明日香一边解开鞋带，一边对她皱眉。她能听到美里在电话中的交谈，虽然没注意具体内容，但捕捉到了她的语气。

Shinji sat down at the dinner table.  
真嗣在餐桌旁坐下。

"...yes, yes. Well, we don't have a fucking choice, do we? That's what I thought. See ya."  
"...是啊，是啊。好吧，我们他妈的没得选，对吧？我就知道。回见。"

Misato slammed the phone down with a resonating "_Fuck!"_ that gave even Asuka a second's pause. She quietly took her place at the table and waited. It wouldn't be long now before she...  
美里用力挂断电话，一声响亮的“该死！”连明日香都为之顿了一顿。她默默地回到桌前坐下，等待着。不久之后她就会...

"Oh." Misato stood there, thumbs hooked into her shorts' pockets, looking at them, "I'm sorry, that wasn't..." she couldn't quite find the word for it, "I suppose, it's best I told you now."  
"哦。" 美里站在那里，拇指勾在短裤口袋里，看着他们，"对不起，那不是..." 她一时找不到合适的词，"我想，最好现在就告诉你们。"

"Told us what?" Shinji asked.  
"告诉我们什么？" 真嗣问道。

"That was Ritsuko. The results of your latest sync test came in."  
"那是律子。你最新的同步测试结果出来了。"

Silence. They waited. Asuka recalled complaining that going to a sync test after the final round of training wasn't in their best interest.  
沉默。他们等待着。明日香回想起自己曾抱怨过，在最后一轮训练后进行同步测试并不符合他们的最佳利益。

Misato sighed. 美里叹了口气。

"Rei, you're 2 points up in the first two rounds, and 4 points up in the last."  
“丽，前两轮你领先两分，最后一轮领先四分。”

Rei gave the slightest of nods. Asuka felt irritation crawl through her.  
丽微微点头。明日香感到一阵烦躁涌上心头。

_Kill you to be human for once, wouldn't it?  
杀掉你，让你终于能当一回人，不是挺好吗？_

"Asuka. Your first round was the same. Second round, you dropped by 3 points and at the final round, you went down 7 points. It's still above cap, but not by much."  
“明日香，你第一轮成绩和之前一样。第二轮下降了 3 分，最后一轮又掉了 7 分。虽然还在合格线之上，但也没高出多少。”

Asuka felt like she had just been punched in the gut. She could only stare blankly at Misato, as if she had just said the Third Impact was going to happen three seconds from now. Before she could begin to vocalize a response, Misato braced herself.  
明日香感觉像是被狠狠揍了一拳，只能茫然地盯着美里，仿佛她刚刚宣布第三次冲击将在三秒后发生。在她能开口回应之前，美里已经做好了准备。

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

Asuka glanced at him, her heart pounding. _Don't say it. Don't say it!_  
明日香瞥了他一眼，心跳如鼓。别说出来。别说出来！

"It's out of my hands now..." she said, "I just want you to know, this isn't a good thing. It's too much of a leap, and it won't last, which would be the best thing to come out of this recent mess..."  
“现在我已经无能为力了……”她说，“我只是想让你知道，这不是件好事。这跨度太大了，不会长久的，而这已经是最近这场混乱中最好的结果了……”

Something was screaming in Asuka's head.  
某种声音在明日香脑海中尖叫着。

"I argued against putting you out there tomorrow, but the Commander thinks otherwise, and what he says, goes, so..."  
"我反对明天让你上场，但指挥官有不同意见，他怎么说就怎么执行，所以..."

"What did I score?" "我得了多少分？"

Misato sighed again. Asuka could barely keep herself seated.  
美里再次叹了口气。明日香几乎无法保持坐姿。

"You _started_ at 100%." Misato said. "Second round, you went up to 134%. The final round has you at 178%."  
"你一开始就是 100%。" 美里说。"第二轮，你提升到了 134%。最后一轮，你达到了 178%。"

Rei cast a curious glance at Shinji, who was sitting, stunned, tongue-tied. In between them, Asuka was beginning to feel that what was being said right now was a merciless joke – it was surreal.  
绫波零好奇地看了真嗣一眼，他正坐在那里，震惊得说不出话来。在他们之间，明日香开始觉得现在所说的这一切是个无情的玩笑——这太不真实了。

"The Commander is away currently, and won't be back in time for the next Angel... but he relayed that you were to take the tactical and actual lead in tomorrow's operation."  
"指挥官目前不在，无法及时赶回来应对下一个使徒……但他传达了指示，要求你在明天的行动中担任战术和实际的领导。"

"_What!?"_ "什么！？"

Asuka rose to her feet, knocking her chair over. Rei pensively surveyed her, while Shinji was stuck looking at the same face that had struck him, only now, clad in pure violence and unrivaled fury. There was a look in her eyes that he was sure could effortlessly shatter an A.T. Field just by turning in its direction.  
明日香站起身来，将椅子撞翻在地。绫波若有所思地打量着她，而真嗣则愣愣地盯着那张曾让他心动的脸庞，如今却满是纯粹的暴力与无与伦比的愤怒。她眼中闪烁的光芒，他确信只需一眼便能轻易粉碎 A.T.力场。

Shinji shook his head, "But I can't take the lead. I don't have enough experience – I don't think I'd be any good in that role. I don't know anything about _leading_."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“但我无法担任领导。我没有足够的经验——我不认为我能胜任那个角色。我对领导一无所知。”

"You have taken the initiative before." Rei said.  
“你曾主动采取过行动。”绫波说道。

"That was when it was just _me,_ I've never lead an operation. I think Asuka is better suited for that. She's done it before. I can chip in, we can coordinate a strategy." Shinji said.  
"那时只有我一个人，我从未领导过行动。我觉得明日香更适合这个角色。她有过经验。我可以帮忙，我们可以一起制定策略。" 真嗣说道。

"She's not an unquestionably superior choice." Rei commented, "Your orders are to take the lead." Rei said, "It does not matter who you think is better suited."  
"她并非无可争议的最佳选择。" 绫波评论道，"你的命令是担任领导。" 绫波说，"无论你认为谁更适合都无关紧要。"

"Rei is right, unfortunately." Misato said, "I mean, I can't disobey a direct order like this one, although I _will_ have a few words with the Commander about this..."  
"不幸的是，绫波说得对。" 美里说，"我是说，我不能违抗这样的直接命令，尽管我会和司令谈谈这件事……"

"We can do it like we always do." Shinji said, "We can come up with a few plans, and maybe, pretend that I'm-"  
"我们可以像往常一样来做这件事。" 真嗣说，"我们可以想出几个计划，也许，假装我是——"

"You _coward._" Asuka snarled, "Are you so inept? Are you so fucking _spineless_ that you're trying to wriggle your way out of this!? As your guardian here drunkenly put it, you _are_ number one now! That's not a trophy, they don't give you a badge for that, and your father isn't beside himself because you are a danger to yourself in your EVA! It's a responsibility, one you're trying to dump onto me so that you'll ease your own burden! You disgust me. You disgust me, all of you, _all of you_!"  
"你这个懦夫。" 明日香咆哮道，"你这么无能吗？你这么他妈的没骨气，想方设法逃避责任吗？！正如你那位醉醺醺的监护人所说，你现在可是第一号人物！那不是奖杯，他们不会给你颁发徽章，你父亲也不是因为你在 EVA 里对自己构成危险而欣喜若狂！那是一种责任，你却想把它推给我，好减轻你自己的负担！你让我恶心。你们都让我恶心，你们所有人，所有人！"

She stomped over to the door, almost stumbling. Her legs weren't functioning that well, for some reason... she picked up her phone and slid her feet into her shoes, one red and one black, and opened the door.  
她跺着脚走到门口，差点摔倒。不知为何，她的腿不太听使唤……她拿起手机，把脚塞进鞋子里，一只红色一只黑色，然后打开了门。

"I'm going to Hikari's. You can pick me up from there, and don't even dream about leaving me behind!"  
"我要去光那里。你可以在那儿接我，别妄想把我丢下！"

She slammed the door home and was walking down the road before any of them could react... and past the park before anyone could hear her scream.  
她砰地一声关上门，在他们任何一人反应过来之前就走上了路……穿过公园，直到无人能听见她的尖叫。

### Chapter 9 Plasmatic
Movement 8 第八乐章
"Plasmatic" “等离子态”

1

The sphere was black. It was decorated with circular patterns of white, embedded onto the surface – full circles creating the illusion of swirls and spirals. It emitted no sound, or at least nothing detectable; those observing it heard a faint, high-pitched reverberation, like a note held forever in the distance. Gigantic in its size, imposing with its presence, it hovered.
那球体是黑色的，表面装饰着白色的圆形图案，这些完整的圆圈营造出漩涡和螺旋的错觉。它没有发出任何声音，或者说至少没有可察觉的声音；观察它的人听到的是一种微弱的高频回响，就像远处永远持续的音符。它体积巨大，气势逼人，悬浮在那里。

It cast a vast shadow.
它投下了一片巨大的阴影。

2

When Misato entered the war room, things were well on their way. Around her, the buzzing of the war room, the humming of the computers and fingers tapping on keys. Makoto, Maya or Shigeru were in the process of tossing a comment between them when Ritsuko, already there and already smoking, greeted Misato.
当美里进入作战室时，一切已经井然有序。她周围是作战室的嗡嗡声，电脑的嗡鸣声和键盘上手指的敲击声。真、麻耶或茂正在他们之间抛出一句评论，而律子已经到了，已经开始抽烟，向美里打招呼。

"You're late." “你迟到了。”

"Sorry! Asuka decided to skip last night, the pilots should be out in a minute. Meanwhile," Misato took her usual place and crossed her arms, "Sitrep."
“抱歉！明日香昨晚决定缺席，飞行员们应该马上就到。与此同时，”美里走到她常坐的位置，交叉双臂，“战况汇报。”

"It just appeared." Maya said, "Out of nowhere, as if it just suddenly began existing."
"它就这样出现了。" 玛雅说，"毫无预兆，仿佛突然间就开始存在了。"

"The Mt. Fuji observation center didn't pick it up." Shigure said.
"富士山观测中心并未捕捉到它的迹象。" 紫苑说。

"And it's just... what? Hovering there?"
"然后它就只是...什么？悬浮在那里？"

"I'm waiting for-" Ritsuko started, but Maya interrupted her.
"我在等——" 律子刚开口，就被摩耶打断了。

"Pattern analysis orange. It's not an Angel."
"橙色模式分析。这不是使徒。"

"What?" Makoto scratched his head, "What else can it be? Just look at it!"
"什么？" 真嗣挠了挠头，"还能是什么？你看看它！"

"We have to make sure." Misato said, "What's the status of the pilots?"
"我们必须确保。" 美里说，"驾驶员的情况如何？"

The viewscreen was split into four, one portion being reserved for the entity and the other four black.
显示屏被分成四部分，其中一块留给那个实体，其余四块则是黑的。

"That thing can do anything at any second... where are they?"
"那东西随时都能做任何事……他们在哪儿？"

Suddenly, one of the blank screens came to life, showing the annoyed and, if Misato was reading it right, slightly sleep-deprived face of Asuka Langley Soryu.
突然，其中一个空白的屏幕亮了起来，显示出明日香·兰格雷那带着恼怒，如果美里没看错的话，还有些许睡眠不足的脸庞。

"Unit 02. Ready." “二号机，准备就绪。”

Misato took the microphone but did not press the comm button.
美里拿起麦克风，但没有按下通讯按钮。

"Sync rate?" she asked. "同步率？" 她问道。

"81.42%." Ritsuko reported, "No, wait... it leapt to 82%. Interesting." Misato opened up the channel.
"81.42%。" 律子报告道，"不，等等... 它跳到了 82%。有意思。" 美里打开了通讯频道。

"Where are the others?" "其他人呢？"

"Behind." “后面。”

Just then, the remaining two screens flickered to life to show the faces of Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami.
就在这时，剩下的两个屏幕闪烁着亮起，显示出碇真嗣和绫波零的面孔。

"79.987% and 186.7%." Ritsuko said, "Nothing unusual in the psychograph or the nerve connections, which is strange in and of itself." Misato clenched her teeth.
“79.987% 和 186.7%。”律子说道，“心理图谱和神经连接都没有异常，这本身就很奇怪。”美里咬紧了牙关。

"Alright, then." She said, "All of you, get in the position. We'll transfer the data we have so far over to you once you're up there. Does anyone have any questions?"
"好吧，那么。" 她说，"你们所有人，站好位置。一旦你们就位，我们会把目前已有的数据传输给你们。有什么问题吗？"

"Shouldn't our Fearless Leader tell us what to do instead of you?"
"难道不该由我们的无畏领袖来告诉我们该做什么，而不是你吗？"

Ritsuko shook her head. 律子摇了摇头。

"I still outrank him." Misato said, "Now, get topside and get into position. We're sending up one weapon each. One word, all of you: caution."
"我还是比他高一级。" 美里说道，"现在，上地面进入位置。我们每人携带一件武器。一句话，大家都要小心。"

2

As Unit 02 moved into position, Asuka felt that the motions were just the smallest bit clunky. It was handling as well as it ever had, but there was a split-second abnormality in her movements that she couldn't quite explain. It did nothing to better her mood.
当二号机进入位置时，明日香感觉到动作略显生硬。它的操控一如既往地好，但她的动作中有一瞬间的不协调，她无法解释。这丝毫没有改善她的心情。

It had been a long walk to Hikari's house, an even more arduous effort to bury her frustrations. She hoped Hikari wouldn't turn her down on her last-minute request... she was prepared to sleep on the street if that was what it took. She was not going back there, to that freakshow.
走到光的家是一段漫长的路程，压抑自己的挫败感更是艰难。她希望光不会拒绝她临时提出的请求……她已经准备好露宿街头，如果那是必要的。她绝不会再回到那个怪胎秀场。

That little coward... they give him an official command, not just some de facto rank, and what does he do with it? Tries to pass it around like it was a radioactive ball. Tries to pass it onto me.
那个小懦夫...他们给了他一个正式的指挥权，不仅仅是名义上的职位，而他用它做了什么？试图像传递一个放射性球一样推给别人。试图把它推给我。

Asuka-chan, did you ever think that maybe he really thought you'd do a better job at taking the lead? He had the right of command, and he chose to pass it onto you. What he said made sense.
明日香，你有没有想过，也许他真的认为你能更好地领导大家？他有指挥权，而他选择把它交给你。他说的话是有道理的。

I don't need his fucking charity, and I won't follow his orders! He doesn't get my respect with his oh-so-shiny Numbah Wann position! He should've felt honored, not scared! It's an insult!
我不需要他的该死的施舍，也不会服从他的命令！他那闪闪发光的'王牌'位置可换不来我的尊重！他应该感到荣幸，而不是害怕！这是侮辱！

Unit 02 moved against the rail and Asuka leaned her EVA back. There, again, that nanosecond of disconnect where the difference between her EVA's back and her own back became apparent. Blink, and you'd miss it, but she caught it.
初号机沿着轨道移动，明日香将她的 EVA 向后倾斜。就在那里，又一次，那微秒的脱节感，她 EVA 的背部与她自己的背部之间的差异变得明显。眨眼间就会错过，但她捕捉到了。

No matter. I'll show him how it's done. Sync ratio doesn't make him my better.
没关系。我会让他看看该怎么做。同步率并不能让他成为我的上级。

With a jolt, the Evangelion was lifted and shot through the system of vertical rails that tied into disinterring spots scattered throughout Tokyo-3. The ascent didn't fill her with the rush that it used to, but it was still there. She was right at home, where she belonged, in an EVA cockpit, suspended in LCL.
随着一阵震动，福音战士被抬起并射入连接到东京-3 各处挖掘点的垂直轨道系统。上升不再给她带来曾经的那种兴奋感，但它依然存在。她正处在她应该在的地方，属于她的地方，在 EVA 驾驶舱中，悬浮在 LCL 中。

I didn't get much sleep last night, that's what's bringing me down.
昨晚没怎么睡好，这就是让我心情低落的原因。

After making it to Hikari's in one piece, too tired but unable to admit it, she had sat up for an hour or two with her. Hikari had been curious about where she had disappeared to, reminding Asuka that she had missed calls, numbering in double digits. She had told Hikari all she could, which was almost nothing. Her friend had, however, noticed that she was down and had asked, which was her right, Asuka supposed, if Shinji had done something again.
好不容易安全抵达光的家，尽管疲惫不堪却无法承认，她与光一起坐了一两个小时。光对她消失的原因感到好奇，提醒明日香她错过了许多电话，数量多达两位数。她尽可能地告诉了光，虽然几乎什么都没说。然而，她的朋友注意到她情绪低落，便询问了，明日香想，如果又是真嗣做了什么，光有权利问。

Asuka hadn't told her anything. She wouldn't discuss him.
明日香什么都没告诉她。她不愿谈论他。

She wouldn't say that she had lost to him.
她不会承认自己输给了他。

The three EVA units came up almost at once, their lifts shooting up and abruptly stopping once they were level with the ground. Their umbilical cables attached, each one surveyed the scene and saw that they had been placed in a semi-circle in front of (it's more like on one side of, Shinji thought) the supposed Angel. The equipment delivery lifts hissed and groaned as they delivered their payloads to each Evangelion. Shinji retrieved the Pallet Rifle and the spare clip. Rei racked the slides of a handgun and picked up the Smash Hawk, weighing the axe out of reflex. Miyamoto's advice was to know the weight of her weapon, so that she could know what it could and could not do.
三台 EVA 单位几乎同时升起，它们的升降机迅速上升，到达地面高度时突然停止。每台 EVA 的脐带电缆连接完毕，它们环视四周，发现自己被放置在一个半圆形的位置，面对着（真嗣觉得更像是在一侧）所谓的使徒。装备运送升降机发出嘶嘶声和呻吟声，将它们的负载交付给每台福音战士。真嗣取回了托盘步枪和备用弹夹。绫波装填了手枪的滑轨并拿起碎击鹰，出于本能地掂量着斧头的重量。宫本武藏的建议是了解自己武器的重量，以便知道它能做什么和不能做什么。

Asuka found that she was set up with a weapon she recognized from their encounter with the Angel Israfel – the Sonic Glaive.
明日香发现自己配备了一件她在与使徒伊斯拉菲尔遭遇时认识的武器——音速战矛。

Oh, that's just great. They stuck me with this thing, too.
哦，真是太好了。他们还把这东西塞给我了。

"What's the status?" Misato asked.
“情况如何？”美里问道。

"Unchanged." Makoto reported, "It's still sitting there."
“没有变化。”真琴报告说，“它还在那儿。”

"Pattern Analysis, iteration 4. It's still orange." Maya said.
“模式分析，第 4 次迭代。还是橙色。”玛雅说道。

"What's it waiting for..?" Misato wondered, mostly to herself.
“它在等什么呢？”美里疑惑着，多半是自言自语。

5

What's it waiting for? Asuka wondered. She had spent the past fifteen minutes waiting for it to make a move, but instead, it was insisting on doing nothing.
它在等什么呢？明日香思索着。她已经等了过去十五分钟，期待它有所动作，但它却执意什么都不做。

Deciding, to hell with it, Asuka opened a conference call to the others. She decided to not take her eyes off the entity – that way, she wouldn't have to look at either one of them.
决定豁出去了，明日香开启了一个多方会议通话。她决定不将视线从那个实体上移开——这样一来，她就不必看他们中的任何一个了。

"It's weird." Shinji said, "It's just sort of there, isn't it? It's not attacking or anything."
“这很奇怪。”真嗣说，“它就那样待着，不是吗？既没有攻击，也没有其他动作。”

"It might be reactive." Rei said, "According to the analysis sent by the HQ, it is not an Angel."
“它可能是反应性的。”绫波说，“根据总部发来的分析，它不是使徒。”

"What does our Fearless Leader suggest?"
"我们的无畏领袖有何高见？"

"I'm not sure." "我不确定。"

"Oh? Shinji the Undefeatable is uncertain? We must be in dire straits already!"
"哦？战无不胜的真嗣也有不确定的时候？看来我们真是陷入绝境了！"

"You're right. We have to do something. What do you think?"
"你说得对。我们必须采取行动。你怎么看？"

"Me? You're the leader, you figure it out!"
"我？你是领导者，你来决定吧！"

"Alright. We'll engage it. Straight line, all of us, we'll converge on one point."
"好吧。我们就这么干。直线前进，我们所有人，集中到一个点上。"

"Understood." Rei said. “明白。”绫波说。

"Hey, Leader, switch with me."
"嘿，队长，跟我换一下。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Weapons. Switch weapons with me."
"武器。跟我换武器。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Are you dense? You can't take the combat lead with that rifle. And my aim is way better than yours."
"你是不是傻？用那把步枪你没法带队作战。而且我的枪法比你强多了。"

"Fine. Catch!" "好，接住！"

Smiling, Asuka spun around and threw the Glaive like a javelin. A second later, she caught the rifle and gave it a whirl. Good. Step one was complete.
微笑着，明日香转过身，将战斧像标枪一样投掷出去。片刻后，她接住了步枪并挥舞了一圈。很好，第一步完成了。

"Here's the spare clip!" "这是备用弹匣！"

Asuka added that to her EVA's armaments. Good.
明日香将那个加入了她的 EVA 的武器装备中。很好。

"I'll approach first." Shinji said, "Wait for two seconds and follow me. Rei, you'll provide us with cover, so you'll have to take off with me."
“我先靠近。”真嗣说道，“等两秒钟再跟上我。绫波，你为我们提供掩护，所以你得和我一起起飞。”

"Roger." Rei said. “收到。”绫波回答道。

"Ready?" “准备好了吗？”

Chance. 机会。

Without warning, Unit 02 launched headlong down the path leading to the unconfirmed Angel. Stomping through the ground, the red Evangelion tore through the distance.
毫无预警地，二号机沿着通往未确认使徒的路径疾驰而下。红色福音战士踏破地面，撕裂了距离。

"Asuka! Shit!" “明日香！该死！”

Unit 01 followed suit a second later. Shinji held the Glaive with both hands and bent forward, giving everything he had to his legs. Inside the cockpit, it didn't feel that the EVA was moving, but rather he himself was gunning for the red Evangelion. He saw Rei making her way through with haste also, but compared to him, she was taking a casual stroll. He saw the scene in front of him not through the visual interface, but drank in every minute detail, every street, every broken window on every building, all the way to the small shapes on the Angel's form (a script, he saw) that from a distance looked like solid lines.
零号机紧随其后，一秒钟后也跟上了。真嗣双手握住长枪，身体前倾，将全身力量集中在双腿上。在驾驶舱内，他感觉不是 EVA 在移动，而是自己在全力冲向红色福音。他看到绫波也急速穿过，但与自己相比，她简直像是在悠闲散步。他眼前的景象并非通过视觉界面，而是将每一处细节尽收眼底，每一条街道，每一扇破碎的窗户，直至远处天使身上那些看似实线的细小形状（他认出那是一种文字）。

He felt his pulse, but it wasn't in his chest or temples – it was spreading throughout his body, coursing through his veins, this pure energy...
他感受到自己的脉搏，但不是在胸口或太阳穴——它遍布全身，涌动在血管中，这种纯粹的能量...

7

As soon as the Angel was within range, Asuka leveled the rifle. She didn't break stride as she fired in three-round bursts, aware of Shinji shouting his protests. She grinned. This one was hers. Another three-burst, nine in total and-
天使一进入射程，明日香便举枪瞄准。她没有放慢脚步，连续发射三连发，无视真嗣的抗议声。她咧嘴一笑。这个目标属于她。又是三连发，总共九发，然后——

8

Alarms wailed, echoing through the spacious cavern of the war room. Fresh information flooded the screens as Misato stopped shouting orders at an unresponsive Asuka.
警报声尖锐刺耳，回荡在作战室的宽阔洞穴中。新情报涌入屏幕，美里停止了对毫无反应的明日香下达命令。

"Pattern analysis confirmed blue!" Maya shouted, "It's an Angel!"
“模式分析确认蓝色！”玛雅喊道，“是使徒！”

"All units-" Misato began, but Maya cut her off.
“所有单位——”美里刚开口，就被玛雅打断了。

"The Angel was detected underneath the sphere!"
"天使在球体下方被探测到了！"

Misato pressed the button.
美里按下了按钮。

"All units, fall back! I said, withdraw, Asuka, what're- Shinji, what are you doing!?"
"所有单位，撤退！我说了撤退，明日香，你在干什么——真嗣，你在做什么！？"

9

The bullets went straight through the sphere. The split-second disconnect made her stumble, slightly, and that was all it took for Shinji to catch up with her.
子弹径直穿过了球体。那一瞬间的断连让她微微踉跄，而这正是真嗣追上她的契机。

Before Asuka could react to either event, Shinji's EVA leapt forward and spun. Shinji's elbow barely missed the side of Unit 02's head, causing Asuka to stumble. Shinji saw Unit 00 out of the corner of his eye – still a good five seconds away. Too long. Unit 01 landed on its feet, and just as Asuka recovered, Shinji flipped the Glaive and held it with both hands before charging the red Evangelion. He went low at the last second, caught Asuka right under her stomach. He put one foot back and, eliciting a surprised shriek from Asuka, lifted and threw Unit 02 away and down the road. Unit 02 reduced the top half of a high-rise to broken glass and masonry with one hand. Shinji swung the Glaive up, extending its reach. The weapon hummed and cut the umbilical cable supplying Asuka.
在明日香对任何事件做出反应之前，真嗣的 EVA 一跃而起并旋转。真嗣的肘部险些擦过 02 号机头部，导致明日香踉跄。真嗣眼角瞥见 00 号机——仍有五秒之遥。太久了。01 号机稳稳落地，就在明日香恢复平衡之际，真嗣翻转长矛并用双手握住，随即向红色 EVA 发起冲锋。他在最后一刻压低身姿，准确地击中明日香腹部下方。他后退一步，引得明日香惊呼一声，将 02 号机举起并抛向道路尽头。02 号机单手将一栋高楼的上半部分化为碎玻璃和砖石。真嗣挥动长矛，延伸其攻击范围。武器嗡鸣着切断了明日香的脐带电缆。

Inside Unit 02's cockpit, a single bleep was heard, and the battery timer appeared. It began to count down, quite rapidly, from 5 minutes.
在 02 号机的驾驶舱内，一声提示音响起，电池计时器随即出现。它开始从 5 分钟迅速倒数。

"Rei!" Shinji said, "Back Asuka!"
"丽！" 真嗣喊道，"支援明日香！"

"Ikari-" "碇——"

"Shinji, what are you doing!?" Misato's strained, almost desperate voice reverberated in the LCL.
"真嗣，你在做什么！？" 美里那几乎绝望的、紧张的声音在 LCL 中回荡。

"What do you think you're doing you-" Asuka's protests were cut short when Shinji moved onto the next step – to take a swipe at the Angel.
“你以为你在干什么你——” 明日香的话还没说完，就被真嗣的下一步行动打断了——他向使徒挥出了一击。

I can do this. I'm the Leader. I can do this!
我能做到。我是队长。我能做到！

Shinji turned and crouched, building the move. He promptly leapt at the Angel, bringing the Glaive around in a graceful, almost impossibly precise vertical arc that went dead center. The blade passed through the shape, cutting only thin air. Shinji saw the Angel's shadow underneath him, rising quickly as Unit 01 fell. It landed hard, but Shinji was back on his feet in no time.
真嗣转身蹲下，蓄势待发。他随即向使徒跃去，挥舞着长戟，划出一道优雅而精准得近乎不可能的垂直弧线，直指中心。然而，刀刃只切过了稀薄的空气。真嗣看到自己身下的使徒影子迅速上升，随着初号机的坠落，他重重地着陆，但很快又重新站了起来。

Unit 01 took two steps back, head tilted up in order to see the shape. That was when Shinji felt a sudden spasm jerk both feet and move up through his legs. He stumbled, gyrating from the waist up to keep himself balanced.
初号机向后退了两步，头部抬起以便观察那个形状。就在这时，真嗣感到一阵突如其来的痉挛从双脚猛地窜上双腿。他踉跄了一下，上半身扭动以保持平衡。

"Ikari," Rei's voice came, "Unit 02 is secure."
“碇君，”丽的声音传来，“二号机已固定。”

"Ayanami..!" “绫波……！”

"...I'm coming to back you up."
"...我来支援你了。"

"That's the Angel!" Misato said, "That's the Angel underneath you!"
"那是使徒！" 美里喊道，"你下面的是使徒！"

When the 'Angel' passed ankle-level, Shinji understood what was happening.
当'使徒'经过脚踝高度时，真嗣明白了正在发生的事情。

10

The war room and the cockpits of Unit 00 and Unit 02 were almost instantly filled with the sound of escalation, of rising panic. The crescendo of terror sounded like a 14-year-old boy, violently taking stabs at the shadow on the ground that'd swallow him, and demanding to know what was happening, where everyone was.
作战室和零号机与二号机的驾驶舱内几乎瞬间充满了升级的声响，恐慌情绪不断攀升。这恐怖的高潮声听起来像一个 14 岁的男孩，疯狂地对着地面上的阴影猛刺，那阴影仿佛要将他吞噬，他迫切地想知道发生了什么，大家都在哪里。

Some hearing it were blessed with the uncertainty of whether he could be helped. Misato didn't have that luxury, and Ritsuko scolded such things. Presently, she took the microphone from Misato.
有些人听到这声音，心中涌起不确定他是否能得到帮助的疑惑。美里没有这种奢侈，律子则斥责这种想法。此刻，她从美里手中接过麦克风。

"What's happening!? What the hell is this!? Somebody, tell me, show me, what's... no. No! No!"
“发生了什么！？这到底是什么鬼东西！？有人告诉我，展示给我，这是什么……不。不！不！”

"Rei. Withdraw." Ritsuko said, "You can't help him."
"丽，撤退。" 律子说道，"你帮不了他。"

"Somebody! Anybody! Misato! Rei! Help me! Help me!"
"谁来！任何人！美里！丽！救救我！救救我！"

"...Understood." replied Rei.
"...明白了。" 丽回答道。"

When Ritsuko passed the microphone back, Unit 02 had sunk in up to its waist. A last-ditch effort saw the EVA chuck the Sonic Glaive at the sphere like a spear, only to have it cut through nothing and fly out of reach.
当律子将麦克风递回时，零二号机已经沉到了腰部。最后一搏，EVA 将音速长矛像标枪一样掷向球体，却只见它穿透虚无，飞出了触及范围。

11

"I'm sinking, I'm sinking! I'm sinking!"
“我在下沉，我在下沉！我在下沉！”

"You fucking idiot! You imbecile! You stupid son of a bitch!"
“你这个混蛋！你这个白痴！你这个蠢货！”

There was not a word for the feeling in Asuka's gut. Guilt. Panic. Worry. Anger. Hurt. Urgency. But most of all, vehement frustration. The counter on the side was telling her that she had 3 minutes left, and counting. In the near distance, Unit 01 was madly clawing at the air, Shinji's screams making the EVA seem almost like a man in a costume – it was as if Unit 01, too, was panicking. It's movements were minutely in sync, right down to the twitchy jerks and incomplete swipes at a non-existent rope.
阿斯卡心中无法用言语形容那种感觉。内疚、恐慌、担忧、愤怒、伤害、紧迫，但最强烈的，是激烈的挫败感。旁边的计时器告诉她，她只剩下 3 分钟了，而且还在倒数。不远处，零一号机疯狂地挥舞着空气，真嗣的尖叫让 EVA 看起来几乎像是一个穿着戏服的人——仿佛零一号机也在恐慌。它的动作细微地同步，就连抽搐的急动和不完整的挥击都一一对应，仿佛在抓一根不存在的绳子。

"Help me! Please! Please someone help me! Stop it! Stop!"
“救救我！求求你们！谁来帮帮我！停下来！快停下来！”

Presently, Unit 02 was on its feet, two hundred meters from the edge of the shadow, trying to press forward. Asuka had gotten on top of a rather sturdy high-rise in order to make the leap. Outside, precariously balanced on the building, which even then was shifting as it strained under the weight of two EVA units, Rei's blue-white Unit 00 was maintaining a tight grip on the red Evangelion's shoulders. Unit 02 strained against the hold, trying to move forward, trying to break free, but Rei held on tight.
此刻，零二号机正站立着，距离阴影边缘两百米，试图向前推进。明日香爬上了一座相当坚固的高楼，以便进行跳跃。外面，危险地平衡在建筑上，尽管建筑在两个 EVA 单位的重量下不断摇晃，绫波的蓝白色零零号机紧紧抓住红色福音的肩膀。零二号机挣扎着想要前进，试图挣脱束缚，但绫波紧紧抓住不放。

Unit 01 was up to its chest. Asuka had two minutes and forty-seven seconds left.
初号机已经淹没至胸口。明日香还剩下两分钟四十七秒。

Unit 00's comm-window opened and Rei's voice, laced with the barest hint of urgency, resonated through the LCL filling Asuka's cockpit.
零号机的通讯窗口打开，绫波的声音带着一丝几乎察觉不到的紧迫感，在充满明日香驾驶舱的 LCL 中回响。

"Stop. You can't do anything."
“停下。你什么都做不了。”

"Let me go you fucking mannequin!" Asuka pulled on the controls, her jaw aching from clenching her teeth with the effort, "Let me go or I'll throw you to the fucking thing! Let... me..."
"放开我，你这个该死的假人！" 明日香用力拉动操纵杆，因用力咬牙而下巴生疼，"放开我，不然我就把你扔给那该死的东西！放...开..."

"We were ordered to retreat. The building underneath us won't hold us both forever."
"我们接到撤退命令了。我们脚下的建筑撑不了太久的。"

"Run back to your owners, then! And to think you call yourself a pilot is-"
"那就滚回你的主人那里去吧！还自称是飞行员，真是..."

"You can't help him." "你帮不了他。"

Pure terror echoed in Unit 02 as Shinji's voice broke through, just as Unit 01's head was swallowed.
纯然的恐惧在 02 号机中回响，真嗣的声音穿透而出，就在 01 号机的头部被吞噬的那一刻。

"Asuka! Asuka, hel-" "明日香！明日香，救——"

Suddenly, there was only static on the line. Shinji's face, burned into the frame as a snapshot of intense fear, vanished into screen snow. The battery power counter was ticking down the time that had already run out.
突然间，电话那头只剩下静电噪音。真嗣的面孔，如同一张定格在极度恐惧中的快照，消失在屏幕的雪花中。电池电量计数器正在倒数已经耗尽的时间。

### Chapter 10 Weakness

**Movement 9 第九乐章  
"Weakness" 「弱点」**

**1**

Ritsuko's matter-of-fact voice and her casual demeanor was this close to making Misato take a fist to her friend's face. Not two hours since Shinji had disappeared into the shadow, and she already seemed like she was bored with the whole affair. Misato knew that Ritsuko-as-a-scientist dictated this, that when it was her work, she was much like a machine, heartless and hyperefficient.  
赤木律子那公事公办的语气和漫不经心的态度，差点让美里一拳打在朋友的脸上。真嗣才消失在阴影中不到两个小时，她就已经显得对整件事感到厌烦了。美里知道，作为科学家的赤木律子是这样的，一旦涉及到她的工作，她就变得像机器一样，冷酷而高效。

But the screams of a fourteen year old boy begging to be rescued still echoed in her head.  
但一个十四岁男孩求救的尖叫声仍回荡在她脑海中。

She was glad that Units 00 and 02 had finally been reigned in. Unit 02 had had to be carried by Rei after it had shut down due to lack of power. Not a word had been heard from either of the pilots, save for Rei reporting that she had secured Unit 02.  
她很高兴 00 号和 02 号机终于被控制住了。02 号机因电力耗尽而停机，不得不由绫波丽搬运。两位驾驶员至今未发一言，除了绫波报告她已确保 02 号机的安全。

Presently, Misato and Ritsuko were in the war room, waiting for the pilots to turn up, so that they could be briefed. The debriefing would have wait.  
此刻，美里和律子在作战室等待着驾驶员的到来，以便进行简报。简报只能稍后再说。

Ritsuko was speaking. 律子正在说话。

"According to this, the sphere we see is the shadow the Angel casts. What we first took to be a shadow is the Angel. By way of technical specifications, the Angel is 680 meters wide, but only 3 nanometers thick."  
“根据这个，我们看到的是使徒投下的影子。我们最初以为是影子的，其实是使徒。从技术规格来看，使徒宽 680 米，但厚度仅有 3 纳米。”

"Why is it so thin?" Makoto asked, "Or rather, why is it so... abnormally proportioned?"  
“为什么它这么薄？”真琴问道，“或者应该说，为什么它的比例如此……异常？”

"According to this," Maya said, "The Angel's A.T. Field isn't of the garden variety."  
"根据这个，" 真希波说，"使徒的 A.T.力场不是普通的类型。"

"And that's the weird thing..." Shigure chimed in, "...isn't it?"  
"而且那很奇怪……" 紫苑插话道，"……不是吗？"

Ritsuko nodded. Misato was listening.  
律子点头。美里在听着。

"The Angel's 'shadow' as we see it is a Dirac Sea." She said, "It's a pocket dimension into which it can observe materials from this dimension. It's a wild guess, but it might be trying to... devour, if you will, Tokyo-3 to reach GeoFront."  
“我们看到的‘天使的影子’实际上是一个狄拉克海。”她说，“这是一个口袋维度，它可以从中观察到这个维度的物质。虽然只是猜测，但它可能试图……吞噬，如果你愿意这么说的话，第三新东京市以达到地底都市。”

"What's Shinji's status?" Misato asked.  
“真嗣的情况怎么样？”美里问道。

"We've just retrieved the umbilical cable." Shigeru said, "It was severed."  
“我们刚刚取回了脐带电缆。”四郎说，“它被切断了。”

"Then he has..." Misato began, but couldn't continue.  
"那么他还有..." 美里开始说，但没能继续下去。

"Five minutes," Maya said, "But the EVA's internal life support system should, if he doesn't move around or panic," Misato clenched her teeth, ", last about 15, maybe 16 hours. 14 now."  
"五分钟，" 真希波说，"但如果他不动也不惊慌，EVA 的内部生命维持系统应该能维持大约 15 到 16 个小时。现在已经是 14 小时了。"

"Technically, he could subsist on LCL." Ritsuko said.  
"从技术上讲，他可以依靠 LCL 生存。" 律子说。

"There has to be a way to get him out." Misato said, crossing her arms, "There has to be."  
“一定有办法把他救出来的。”美里交叉双臂说道，“一定有。”

"While we work on an idea I have," Ritsuko said, "You better go down there and collect your pilots."  
“在我们研究我的想法时，”律子说，“你最好下去把你的驾驶员们集合起来。”

Misato glared at her, her disbelief mingling with her distress, but figured that the best thing she could do was walk out of the war room.  
美里瞪了她一眼，难以置信与焦虑交织，但她认为最好的做法是走出作战室。

**2**

When Asuka got to the hallway that'd lead them back into the base, she found that Rei was waiting for her, her bluish hair still slightly wet from the LCL. Just seeing her stand there, face blank, infuriated her.  
当明日香走到通往基地的走廊时，她发现绫波零正在等她，她那蓝灰色的头发因 LCL 而依旧微湿。只是看到她站在那里，面无表情，就让她怒火中烧。

"Waiting to gloat?" Asuka asked.  
“等着看笑话吗？”明日香问道。

"They're waiting for us." Rei announced, like how one would say that it was snowing outside.  
“他们在等我们。”绫波宣布道，就像在说外面下雪了一样。

"I'm not deaf." Asuka said.  
"我又不是聋子。" 明日香说道。

"You didn't respond." "你刚才没回应。"

"I don't get a choice, so why bother? And what're we gonna do there? Tell them what a colossal failure that was? Or what a moron he was?"  
"反正我没得选，何必费那个劲？再说我们去那儿干嘛？告诉他们那次失败有多惨烈？还是他有多蠢？"

A small muscle on the side of Rei's lips twitched. Asuka caught it.  
丽嘴角的一小块肌肉抽搐了一下。明日香捕捉到了这一瞬间。

"What? It's his own damn fault! His plan, if you could call it that, was weak, and then he decided to screw with me instead of keeping his eye on the prize, and then he pulled that idiotic stunt with the Glaive – if there's one thing that's for sure, that fool brought it on his own damn self! That's what happens when you choose a sheep to do a wolf's work, I mean – what is he, totally brainless?"  
“什么？那是他自找的！他的计划，如果你能称之为计划的话，太弱了，然后他决定来惹我而不是盯着目标，接着他又搞出那个用战戟的愚蠢把戏——可以肯定的是，那个傻瓜完全是自作自受！这就是当你选择一只羊去做狼的工作时会发生的事，我是说——他是不是完全没脑子？”

The punch came out of nowhere and blinded her with its impact – Asuka felt it crack just short of her eye. It was a sturdy blow, much more powerful than she would have expected of the sickly-looking First Children, but it sent her stumbling, tripping over her own feet. She caught the wall at the last second and managed to keep standing.  
一记重拳突如其来，让她眼前一黑——明日香感到拳头在离她眼睛不远处裂开。这是一记结实的打击，比她预期的那个病恹恹的第一适格者要强得多，但这让她踉跄后退，差点绊倒自己。她在最后一刻扶住了墙，勉强站稳了脚跟。

"Really?" she asked through a vicious smile, "Does me saying bad stuff about him make you this angry..?"  
"真的吗？" 她带着恶意的笑容问道，"我说他的坏话会让你这么生气吗？"

Asuka looked through her hair to find Rei as she had never seen her before – her face was an expression of anger.  
明日香透过她的头发，发现丽的样子是她从未见过的——她的脸上带着愤怒的表情。

"Do you really pilot the EVA just so that others will give you praise?" Rei asked, "Is that praise so important to you, that you'd throw Ikari away just to get it? Are you that insecure?"  
"你真的只是为了得到别人的赞扬才驾驶 EVA 吗？" 丽问道，"那些赞扬对你来说就那么重要，以至于你可以抛弃碇君来换取它？你就那么缺乏安全感吗？"

Asuka shook, but didn't show it. Not to her. She wouldn't get the satisfaction.  
明日香颤抖着，但没有表现出来。不会让她得逞的。

"No. I need no praise. I know I'm the best, and that's enough."  
“不，我不需要赞美。我知道我是最棒的，这就足够了。”

Rei rubbed her knuckles. 绫波揉了揉她的指节。

"You don't know anything." She said.  
"你什么都不知道。" 她说。

**3**

Shinji stared at the familiar ceiling of Unit 01's cockpit. It had been little more than two hours, and he was still alive. The EVA had shut down, yes – the battery had gone out as he had trashed around, trying to find something to go by, some point of reference that'd give him a sense of direction. There had been nothing – the vast, blank space outside of the EVA was displayed only as pitch-black screens, which had turned off when the battery had gone out. It cut his awareness of the EVA, and by extension, he felt like he had been stuffed into the tight space of the entry plug for the first time since he had entered it. After he hadn't choked to death in fifteen minutes (by his estimate), Shinji had remembered that the EVA had a life-support function. He didn't know how long it'd last, but thought it best to not move around too much.  
真嗣凝视着初号机驾驶舱里熟悉的天花板。仅仅过去了两个小时，他还活着。EVA 已经关闭，是的——电池在他四处乱撞试图寻找参照点时耗尽了，希望能给他一些方向感。但什么都没有——EVA 外广阔无垠的空白空间只显示为漆黑的屏幕，当电池耗尽时也熄灭了。这切断了他对 EVA 的感知，进而感觉自己像是第一次被塞进插入栓的狭小空间。在十五分钟内（据他估计）没有窒息而死后，真嗣想起了 EVA 有生命维持功能。他不知道它能持续多久，但认为最好不要过多移动。

He'd just wait. They wouldn't abandon him. He knew they wouldn't. They'd help him. Misato would. Ritsuko would. Rei would.  
他只需等待。他们不会抛弃他。他知道他们不会。他们会帮助他。美里会。律子会。绫波会。

Asuka would. Maybe. 明日香会吧。或许。

**4**

Misato moved out of cover once Asuka was standing up right again, rubbing her cheek. She marched over to them. Asuka saw her, and put her hands on her hips, which pissed Misato off right then and there. Rei turned around and gave her a nod in greeting. Misato decided to stop just short of Rei and keep her out of arm's length.  
明日香再次站稳后，摩挲着脸颊，美里才从掩体后走出，大步向她们走来。明日香看到她，双手叉腰，这让美里顿时火冒三丈。丽转过身，向她点头致意。美里决定在离丽还有一步之遥的地方停下，保持一臂之距。

"Rei." Misato said, "Do you know where the forward quarters are?"  
“丽。”美里问道，“你知道前线指挥部在哪里吗？”

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

"Get some rest. You're on standby."  
"休息一下吧。你现在是待命状态。"

Rei walked off. Asuka was about to protest when Misato's gaze stopped her short.  
丽走开了。明日香正要抗议，却被美里的一瞥制止了。

"You." Misato said, "Are you quite finished?"  
"你。"美里说，"你完事了吗？"

Asuka's jaw dropped. 明日香的下巴掉了下来。

"He acted like an idiot, acted carelessly." Misato said, "When he gets back, and he will be back here if I have anything to do with it, I'm going to let him have it. That last stunt he pulled is inexcusable. Attacking a fellow pilot, rushing blindly ahead... he's in for a good, solid scolding."  
“他表现得像个白痴，行为鲁莽。”美里说，“等他回来，如果我有办法的话，他一定会回来的，我要好好教训他一顿。他最后那次鲁莽的行为是不可原谅的。攻击同僚驾驶员，盲目冲上前去……他等着接受一次严厉的训斥吧。”

Asuka's smile could only form halfway, as Misato continued.  
明日香的笑容只能勉强形成一半，因为美里继续说着。

"He did it to protect you." Misato said, "Do you understand that? After all the shit you gave him, he did it to protect you." Silence, "You switched weapons to have an excuse to be on the vanguard. You started off early in his countdown to get a head-start. You were the one positioned in the middle of the other two, so you went for the spear tip formation – except you didn't."  
"他是为了保护你。" 美里说，"你明白吗？尽管你给了他那么多麻烦，他这么做是为了保护你。" 沉默片刻，"你换武器是为了找个借口冲在前线。你在他的倒计时开始前就提前行动，抢得先机。你站在另外两人的中间，所以你选择了矛尖阵型——只是你并没有这么做。"

"Wait a minu-" "等一下——"

"You did it so you could have a shot at taking out the Angel before they could get into position. You did it so you could kill the Angel by yourself. Isn't that right?"  
"你这么做是为了在天使进入位置前有机会干掉它。你这么做是为了独自杀死天使。对吧？"

"I'm a pilot!" Asuka said, her voice rising, "Killing Angels is what I do!"  
"我是个飞行员！" 明日香的声音提高了，"杀使徒就是我的工作！"

"You _failed._" Misato spat, "Shinji is more than you ever gave him credit for. He saw what you were doing, and realized how stupid, how dangerous it was – he put you out of action because you were a danger to _yourself._ To keep you from getting hurt. He went on ahead after that, because he thought he could handle it alone. Because of all the sync-ratio _bullshit_ of the past two weeks. Because of me. And because of _you._"  
"你失败了。" 美里厉声说道，"真嗣比你想象的要强得多。他看穿了你的所作所为，意识到那是多么愚蠢、多么危险——他让你失去行动能力是因为你对自己构成了威胁。为了保护你不受伤害。之后他独自前行，因为他认为自己能应付得来。因为过去两周的同步率胡扯。因为我。还有因为你。"

Asuka was almost shaking.  
明日香几乎在颤抖。

"For that, you don't get a scolding." Misato said, "You don't get off that easily. Now find the forward quarters and wait for your orders."  
“为此，你不会挨骂。”美里说道，“你可没那么容易脱身。现在去找前舱待命，等待指令。”

Misato turned and walked away without a glance behind.  
美里转身离去，没有回头看一眼。

**4**

Misato could feel a headache coming on as she entered the war room to find Ritsuko's talented fingers moving rapidly across the back-lit keys of Maya's console. Maya, Shigure and Matoko were lost in discussion, their words indistinct and whatever ones Misato caught were pieces of technical terminology. She approached the crowd and peered over Ritsuko's head. What she was doing, Misato saw, was arranging a set of variables (the numbers 1 and 992 repeated frequently) into a calculation of some sort.  
美里走进作战室，感觉到一阵头痛袭来，只见律子的巧手在真希波控制台的背光键盘上飞速移动。真希波、时雨和真子正沉浸在讨论中，她们的话语模糊不清，美里听到的只是一些技术术语的片段。她走近人群，从律子头顶望去。她所做的，美里看到，是将一组变量（频繁出现数字 1 和 992）排列成某种计算。

"What've you got?" Misato asked. Maya, Makoto and Shigure stepped back to salute her.  
"你有什么发现？" 美里问道。真耶、诚和时雨退后一步向她敬礼。

"We've come up with something." Ritsuko said, "The calculations are still incomplete, but the theory is sound."  
"我们有了一些进展。" 律子说，"计算还在进行中，但理论是可靠的。"

"Just tell me, Ritsuko." "直接告诉我吧，律子。"

"We can commission the JSSDF to bring about all of the N2 bombs they posses." Ritsuko said, "Our records indicate that they have 992."  
"我们可以委托自卫队调用他们所有的 N2 炸弹。" 律子说，"我们的记录显示他们有 992 枚。"

"N2 bombs aren't that effective against the Angels, though they were meant to be." Matoko said, "But that might have been because we used too little of them."  
"N2 炸弹对使徒的效果并不理想，尽管它们本应如此。" 真希说，"但这可能是因为我们使用得太少了。"

"The A.T. Field is still a problem." Ritsuko said, "Which is what curbs the effectiveness of the bombs."  
"A.T.力场仍然是个问题。" 律子说，"这也是限制炸弹效果的原因。"

Misato raised an eyebrow.  
美里挑了挑眉毛。

"You're not suggesting..."  
“你不是在建议……”

Ritsuko nodded. 律子点了点头。

"If it is feasible enough, we will drop all 992 bombs directly into the Angel."  
"如果这方案可行，我们就直接把 992 枚炸弹全部投进使徒体内。"

"...what?" "...什么？"

"If the remaining two EVA units can neutralize the A.T. Field, then we have a chance."  
"如果剩下的两台 EVA 能中和 A.T.力场，那我们就有机会了。"

"Are you..." Misato found it hard to even say it, "...serious?"  
"你是……" 美里发现自己连说出口都很难，"……认真的吗？"

"It's feasible." Maya offered.  
"这是可行的。" 真希波提议道。"

"What about Shinji? Can the EVA even take that much!?"  
"那真嗣呢？EVA 能承受那么大的负荷吗？！"

"The recovery of Unit 01's body takes priority. As long as we can retrieve it..."  
"必须优先考虑回收 01 号机体的任务。只要我们能取回它..."

"Ritsuko!" Misato shouted, mortified "You can't be serious! This wouldn't be a rescue operation, this'd be murder!"  
"律子！" 美里惊呼，感到震惊，"你不是认真的吧！这根本不是救援行动，这是谋杀！"

Ritsuko sighed. 律子叹了口气。

"Could you give us a moment?" she asked those assembled. One by one, they all walked out. Ritsuko took off her glasses and turned the chair around to face Misato, who was desperately hoping to hear something that she had missed, something that made it alright.  
"能给我们一点时间吗？" 她向在场的众人问道。一个接一个，他们都走了出去。律子摘下眼镜，转过椅子面对美里，后者正迫切希望听到一些她遗漏的信息，一些能让这一切变得合理的信息。

"Truth is, Shinji shouldn'tve been in this position in the first place."  
"事实是，真嗣一开始就不该陷入这种境地。"

"But... come on, Ritsuko..."  
"但是...拜托，律子..."

"His survival is not a concern." Ritsuko said, without a hint of emotion, "Whether he lives is not important here. What's important is the retrieval of Unit 01 from the Angel. Anything else is for academic papers to pontificate on."  
"他的生死无关紧要。" 律子毫无感情地说道，"他是否活着在这里并不重要。重要的是从使徒手中夺回初号机。其他的一切，留给学术论文去空谈吧。"

Misato was speechless. 美里无言以对。

"If it's any consolation, the timetable of this puts us well outside Shinji's life expectancy. If nothing changes, he will have been dead already."  
“如果这能带来些许安慰的话，这个时间表已经远远超出了真嗣的预期寿命。如果没有任何改变，他早已不在人世。”

Track 25. 第 25 轨。

What was it called, Shinji wondered, and why couldn't he remember? The mere thought of it conjured up several images, but the most prominent and fully-realized of them was the intersection. The sun would be at a certain angle that he couldn't measure. There'd be a man wearing a suit, whom Shinji had seen once in NERV and thought he might be working there, carrying a brown briefcase. The topmost button of his shirt would be undone.  
那东西叫什么来着，真嗣纳闷，为何他记不起来？光是想到它就浮现出几个画面，但最鲜明、最完整的莫过于那个十字路口。太阳会处于一个他无法测量的角度。会有一个穿着西装的男人，真嗣曾在 NERV 见过他一次，以为他在那里工作，提着一个棕色公文包。他衬衫最上面的扣子会解开。

As Track 25 was there, it also sometimes wasn't. The mixtape had 27 tracks in it, the 26th an interlude leading up to the final one, which was always incomplete. Shinji didn't quite know the song all that well, as the scant few times when he had actually managed to listen to it didn't let him learn it. Always, always incomplete.  
Track 25 在那里，有时又不在。这张混音带共有 27 首曲目，第 26 首是过渡到最后一首的间奏，而最后一首总是未完成的。真嗣对这首歌并不十分熟悉，因为那寥寥几次他设法听完的时候，都没能让他学会。总是，总是未完成的。

Shinji had figured that if he had started to listen to the mixtape and picture songs in their entirety, leaving nothing out, no matter how tedious, he could have a measure of the time that had passed.  
真嗣曾想过，如果他开始听这张混音带，并完整地想象每首歌，不遗漏任何部分，无论多么乏味，他就能衡量出时间的流逝。

That was 82 minutes and 31 seconds ago, and in 2... 3... 1...  
那是在 82 分钟 31 秒前，而在 2... 3... 1...

_This is stupid. 这太蠢了。_

The chill of the entry plug, first at his feet, was slowly moving up his legs. It was getting colder. Shinji could do nothing but stare at what passed for a familiar ceiling, and think of Track 25.  
插入栓的寒意，从他的脚开始，正慢慢向上蔓延至双腿。越来越冷了。真嗣只能盯着那勉强算是熟悉的天花板，想着第 25 轨音乐。

There were rare times when he didn't listen to that particular tape – those times when he walked Asuka home, or escorted her to school. The volatile redhead would be a mixture of emotions, full of notions and references to things he didn't know about or didn't understand, brand new jabs at him and his distinctive existence, so much so that he often wondered if she spent some time coming up with them all.  
偶尔也会有那么几次，他没有听那盘特定的磁带——比如送明日香回家，或是护送她去学校的时候。这位情绪多变的红发女孩总是满脑子新奇的想法和典故，他不懂也不理解，她总是用这些新花样来挖苦他，质疑他独特的存在，以至于他常常怀疑她是否花时间精心策划了这一切。

_What does it matter, anyway..? What does any of it matter?  
反正又有什么关系呢...这一切又有什么意义呢？_

_How long has it been, just now..?  
刚刚已经过去多久了...？_

**6**

Asuka didn't know how much time had passed. The forward quarters was a series of small rooms that allowed a cot (or a series of cots) and a night stand, all military issue. The rooms themselves were gridlocked, stuck on either sides of a long corridor. A pilot's clearance allowed her to take a single room, which she had. The light was off. She hadn't bothered to turn it on.  
明日香不知道已经过去了多少时间。前舱是一系列狭小的房间，每个房间里有一张折叠床（或几张）和一个军用床头柜。这些房间像棋盘上的格子一样，紧挨着一条长长的走廊两侧。作为飞行员，她有权占用一个单间，这正是她所做的。房间里的灯是关着的，她懒得去开。

Something in the pit of her stomach wouldn't leave her alone.  
她胃里某个地方的感觉让她无法释怀。

It felt like the onset of her period, which she still didn't understand why she had to get (she didn't want children, she hated them.) Cold, merciless, inescapable and inside her, where she couldn't dig to and claw it out.  
这感觉就像她月经来潮的预兆，她仍然不明白为什么自己必须经历这些（她不想要孩子，她讨厌他们）。冰冷、无情、无法逃避，而且就在她体内，让她无法挖掘出来，用爪子将其抓出。

"_You failed."_ "你失败了。"

"I hate Misato." Asuka whispered, "Who wants to take orders from a drunk?"  
"我讨厌美里。" 明日香低声说，"谁愿意听一个醉鬼的命令？"

"_Are you that insecure?"_ "你就那么不自信吗？"

"I hate Rei. She's just like a puppet. A doll."  
"我讨厌丽。她就像个傀儡。一个玩偶。"

"_Asuka! Asuka, hel-"_ "明日香！明日香，救——"

Asuka clenched her teeth. She couldn't get that sound out of her head – the sound of her name, desperately mouthed, like a prayer. Like a prayer one would say to God when one wanted help, two seconds before the impact hit home. Reaching out, trying to catch, begging for help, help, help, _help me, help me..._  
明日香咬紧牙关。她无法摆脱那个声音——她的名字，绝望地呼喊，像祈祷一样。就像一个人在撞击来临前两秒，向神明祈求帮助时所说的祈祷。伸出双手，试图抓住，恳求帮助，救救我，救救我...

Asuka shook her head. The snapshot of his face seemed to have been burned into her eyelids. She wished she had never looked. There she was, alone, in a dark room having to contend with this pain inside her without even knowing what it was, and...  
明日香摇了摇头。他的脸庞快照仿佛烙印在她的眼睑上。她真希望自己从未看过。独自一人，身处黑暗的房间，不得不与内心的痛苦抗争，甚至不知道那是什么，而且……

"I hate this, I hate _this!"_ Asuka said, vocalizing it felt like she was actually screaming at someone, "Why do I have to be stuck in here for his mistake!? That fucking brainless moron! He just had to go ahead, he just had to get in my way! He-"  
“我讨厌这个，我讨厌这个！”明日香喊道，说出来感觉像是在对某人尖叫，“为什么我得因为他犯的错被困在这里？！那个该死的没脑子的白痴！他就非得往前冲，就非得挡我的路！他——”

"_He did it to protect you."_  
“他是为了保护你。”

"Why? Why?" "为什么？为什么？"

Asuka felt the scream knotted in her throat. It wanted to get out, it had to get out, it had to be felt as it strummed furiously on her vocal chords.  
明日香感到那声尖叫在她的喉咙里纠结。它想要冲出来，它必须冲出来，它必须被感受到，因为它在她声带上猛烈地弹拨着。

"_I_ _hate Shinji!"_ "我讨厌真嗣！"

Asuka punched the wall. The pain barely registered.  
明日香一拳打在墙上。疼痛几乎感觉不到。

"I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, _I hate him!_ Why does he have to be so... so..."  
“我恨他，我恨他，我恨他，我恨他！为什么他非得这么...这么...”

The thought twisted itself around, reflecting the other side of the thin looking glass. Everything she felt, condensed into one word, caught her unawares and brought her down. Asuka didn't dare venture near the thought, because the only thing she could see in it was demise.  
这个念头扭曲着缠绕起来，映照出那面薄薄的镜子另一侧的景象。她所有的情感，凝结成一个词，猝不及防地将她击倒。明日香不敢靠近这个念头，因为在其中她只能看到毁灭。

_Look at this, just look at me! You've made me weak! I let my guard down for one moment and you made me weak! I hate you. I hate you.  
看看这个，看看我！你让我变得软弱！我放松警惕一瞬间，你就让我变得软弱！我恨你。我恨你。_

Misato's cold distance, Rei's punch, Kaji's absence...  
美里冷漠的距离，丽的一拳，加持的缺席……

_I hate you all! I hate every single one of you but the one I hate the most is_ myself!  
我恨你们所有人！我恨你们每一个，但我最恨的是我自己！

"No..." her voice broke, "No... no... no... this isn't..."  
"不..." 她的声音哽咽了，"不...不...不...这不是..."

_I failed. All I did was fuck things up, out there... some Field Commander. The rank doesn't even exist, I just made it up to make it seem more like I was in charge. I wasn't fooling anybody.  
我失败了。我所做的只是把事情搞砸，在那边...什么战场指挥官。这个军衔根本不存在，我只是编造出来让自己看起来更有掌控力。我并没有愚弄任何人。_

Tears began to fall. Asuka stumbled back and onto the bed, her momentum carrying her head right onto the wall. Her teeth rattled, but she didn't feel the pain. She didn't feel anything at all.  
泪水开始滑落。明日香踉跄后退，倒在床上，她的冲力使她的头直接撞到了墙上。她的牙齿咯咯作响，但她感觉不到疼痛。她什么也感觉不到。

_Idiot... and now you're probably dead.  
白痴...现在你大概已经死了。_

A snapshot of Shinji's scared face, now hers – dead. Flesh dessicated, lips pulled back to reveal an eternal, rotting snarl. Thinning strands of hair decorating the scalp like dead leaves. Maggots, big ones, small ones, crawling into her eye sockets, one poking its head out of a nose hole, the red plugsuit ruined and-  
一张真嗣惊恐的面孔，如今成了她的——已死。肉体干瘪，嘴唇后扯，露出永恒腐烂的怒容。稀疏的发丝如枯叶般点缀着头皮。蛆虫，大的小的，爬进她的眼窝，一只探出鼻孔，红色驾驶服破烂不堪——

Her stomach lurched. She bent forward, barely making it into position and threw up bile. She sat there, coughing, trying to pull herself together.  
她胃里一阵翻腾。弯下身去，勉强摆好姿势，吐出了胆汁。她坐在那里，咳嗽着，试图让自己振作起来。

_I'm the one who had to save you...  
是我救了你..._

### Chapter 11 Wannabe

**Movement 10 第十乐章  
"Wannabe" 《想成为》**

**1**

The LCL was starting to get just a bit thicker. It had turned into freezing what felt like hours ago, prompting him to curl up in order to preserve his body heat. After that, the lights had dimmed to the point of near-darkness, the dance of claustrophobia and agoraphobia nauseating him. Then, he had begun to actually taste LCL. Coppery, heavy and bitter, it had grown thicker in substance until...  
LCL 开始变得稍微浓稠了一些。几个小时前，它变得冰冷刺骨，促使他蜷缩起来以保存体温。之后，灯光暗淡到近乎黑暗，幽闭恐惧和广场恐惧的交织让他感到恶心。接着，他开始真正尝到 LCL 的味道。铜腥、沉重且苦涩，它的质地逐渐变得浓稠，直到...

Shinji choked. He tried to draw in breath, every attempt reminding him that he couldn't.  
真嗣哽住了。他试图吸气，每一次尝试都提醒着他无法呼吸。

_Purification filter is shot. I'm inhaling blood. I'm swallowing blood. I'm drinking blood.  
净化过滤器坏了。我在吸入血液。我在吞咽血液。我在饮血。_

_They all said I'd get myself killed. I'll drown in blood, that's my end.  
他们都说过我会自取灭亡。我会溺死在血中，那就是我的结局。_

Shinji felt a strange calm overtake him, despite the strain of trying to breathe through contaminated LCL. He felt his muscles relax, and he opened up, spreading his limbs and settling into the drift. He could feel his body gently floating down to the pilot's seat, his own weight pulling him, millimeter by millimeter.  
尽管通过受污染的 LCL 呼吸十分费力，真嗣却感到一种奇异的平静笼罩了他。他感觉到肌肉放松，身体打开，四肢伸展，逐渐适应了与 EVA 的同步。他能感觉到自己的身体轻轻地漂向驾驶座，自身的重量一毫米一毫米地将他拉下。

Shinji closed his eyes. 真嗣闭上了眼睛。

_If I could just sleep, maybe when I wake up, they'll have found me... just for a few minutes... I'd much prefer to die in my sleep.  
如果我能就这样睡去，或许当我醒来时，他们已经找到我了...就几分钟...我宁愿在睡梦中死去。_

_Who am I kidding... 我这是在自欺欺人..._

**EVANGELION UNIT 02: SECOND CHILDREN  
福音战士初号机 02：第二适格者**

**SYNCHRONIZATION RATE: 64.09%  
同步率：64.09%**

**3**

Asuka felt the LCL irritate her slightly. She found that she was, despite everything else, still uneasy with the fact that it was essentially a liquid. It wasn't just that. The EVA felt downright heavy. Reluctant. Sluggish.  
明日香感到 LCL 轻微刺激着她。尽管其他一切都已适应，她仍对这本质上是一种液体的事实感到不安。不仅如此，EVA 也感觉异常沉重，不情愿，行动迟缓。

"Come on." Asuka said, wearily, "Come on. You are my EVA. You are my doll. Don't disagree with me. Do what I tell you to do. I'm telling you to wake up."  
"快点。" 明日香疲惫地说，"快点。你是我的 EVA。你是我的玩偶。别反驳我。照我说的做。我命令你醒来。"

Unit 02, propped up against the umbilical bridge with its umbilical cable attached as per Asuka's commands, didn't shift by much. Asuka herself didn't feel at all up to par – it felt like weights were tied to her limbs, and someone had made sure she didn't sleep for a week straight. Nevertheless, she tried. She opened up a comm channel to the war room. It took a while, but Misato's face finally appeared.  
02 号机按照明日香的指令，依靠在供给桥上，脐带电缆连接着，几乎没有移动。明日香自己感觉一点也不在状态——仿佛四肢被绑上了重物，而且有人确保她整整一周没有合眼。尽管如此，她还是尝试了。她打开了一个通往指挥室的通讯频道。花了些时间，但美里最终还是出现在了屏幕上。

"_Asuka, why are you in Unit 02?"_  
"明日香，你为什么在 02 号机里？"

"It's my EVA. I'll live in it if I want to."  
"这是我的 EVA。我想住在里面就住在里面。"

Misato sighed. 美里叹了口气。

"_I'm not letting you topside if you intend to go wild again. Not now."_  
"如果你打算再次失控，我不会让你上地面的。现在不行。"

"Try and stop me." Asuka spat, "Anyway, I'm not going to jump into something I can't see the depths of. I'm going up there a bit early to see for myself what's happening. I'm a genius, I'm sure you've heard, and I might see something you missed. So clear my launch."  
"试试阻止我。" 明日香啐道，"无论如何，我不会贸然跳进一个看不清深浅的地方。我要提前上去亲自看看发生了什么。我是个天才，你肯定听说过，我可能会发现你忽略的东西。所以，给我清空发射区。"

"_Asuka, it's... we don't... it's almost to the operation. Shinji's life support will shut down soon. There might not be much you can..."_  
"明日香，这...我们不...手术快开始了。真嗣的生命维持系统很快就会关闭。你可能帮不上太多..."

"All the more reason, then."  
"那就更有理由了。"

Silence on the other end. Asuka saw Misato bite her lip, and knew that she had won.  
电话那头一片沉默。明日香看到美里咬了咬嘴唇，知道她赢了。

**4**

The empty train was moving. Going nowhere. The rhythmic clacking was almost a lullaby, or maybe the beating of two hearts, one after the other. The sun was too bright to see anything out the window. The passenger sat there, in his lap the broken pieces of an SDAT player. He felt a sense of loss at the destruction of the machine, strangely detached from actual meaning, but still there. The gleam reflecting off of the plastic surface reminded him of the dying of the light.  
空荡荡的列车在行驶。驶向无何有之乡。有节奏的咔嗒声几乎像是一首摇篮曲，又或许是两颗心，一个接一个地跳动。阳光太过耀眼，窗外什么也看不见。乘客坐在那里，膝上放着一台 SDAT 播放器的破碎零件。他对这台机器的毁坏感到一种莫名的失落，虽然与实际意义相去甚远，但依然存在。塑料表面反射的光芒让他想起了光明的消逝。

_The object is meaningless.  
这东西毫无意义。_

Shinji blinked and suddenly, sitting opposite from him, was a boy. He looked like him, Shinji saw, almost exactly like him. He was sitting with his arms crossed, and the sunset light didn't let Shinji see his face. Shinji looked around to see if there was anyone else. There was one, a woman in the next compartment, whose silhouette was the only thing he could see.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，突然间，对面坐着一个男孩。他看起来像他，真嗣发现，几乎和他一模一样。他双臂交叉坐着，夕阳的光线让真嗣看不清他的脸。真嗣环顾四周，看看是否还有其他人。确实有一个，隔壁车厢的一位女士，他只能看到她的轮廓。

"Excuse me?" he asked, "Who are you?"  
“请问……”他问道，“你是谁？”

_Shinji Ikari. 碇真嗣。_

"That's me." "那就是我。"

_I am you. One has a self within oneself, just as one has a self within others.  
我是你。每个人心中都有自我，正如每个人在他人心中也有自我。_

"Others?" "他人？"

_The self that watches itself and the self that is watched by others. Each of them are true.  
自我观察的自我与被他人观察的自我。每一个都是真实的。_

"And the object is meaningless."  
“而对象本身是无意义的。”

_It does not have a self, only the imbued self, put there by another self, one that watches others.  
它没有自我，只有被赋予的自我，由另一个观察他人的自我所赋予。_

"Who are these other selves?"  
“这些其他的自我是谁？”

_The Shinji Ikari that exists in your mind. The Shinji Ikari that exists in Misato Katsuragi's mind. The Shinji Ikari that exists in Gendo Ikari's mind...  
存在于你心中的碇真嗣。存在于葛城美里心中的碇真嗣。存在于碇源堂心中的碇真嗣……_

"I don't exist in his mind..."  
“我在他心中不存在……”

_The Shinji Ikari that exists in Rei Ayanami's mind. The Shinji Ikari in Asuka Langley Soryuu's mind... you are afraid of them all, yet you fear that one the most.  
存在于绫波零心中的碇真嗣。存在于惣流·明日香·兰格雷心中的碇真嗣……你害怕他们所有人，但你最害怕的是那一个。_

"She doesn't care for me at all."  
“她根本不在乎我。”

_You looked to her for help.  
你向她寻求帮助。_

"I'm not afraid to." "我并不害怕。"

_You fear the Shinji Ikari in her mind, because you feel like that self is the only one you can change, but don't know how to.  
你害怕她心中的碇真嗣，因为你觉得那个自我是你唯一能改变的，但又不知道如何去做。_

"What does it matter anymore? I'm..."  
"现在还有什么关系呢？我……"

**5**

Unit 02 lurched forward, its movements even, calculated, but also robotic and lacking in grace. Asuka gradually pushed the EVA further, forcing it to move down. She pulled out her Prog Knife just in case, as she hadn't managed to coax more weapons out of Misato. Still, the Prog Knife in and of itself was an impressive piece of hardware, so she had that on her side.  
初号机 02 猛地向前一冲，动作平稳、计算精准，却也机械生硬，缺乏优雅。明日香逐渐加大力度，迫使 EVA 继续前进。她拔出了进度刀以防万一，毕竟她还没能从美里那里争取到更多武器。不过，进度刀本身已是令人印象深刻的装备，她至少有这个优势在手。

"Why are you so slow..? This is my chance, do what I tell you to do. Go faster."  
“为什么你这么慢……？这是我的机会，照我说的做。快点。”

In the distance, she could see the sphere that was Leliel, still floating. Asuka was more mindful of the shadow on the ground, which, she saw, had already submerged all that, until recently, had been above it. It was beyond jumping range, and Asuka knew that the "Angel" wouldn't be harmed... nobody had said anything about the shadow.  
远处，她能看到那个悬浮的球体——雷里尔，依旧飘浮着。明日香更加留意地面上的阴影，她注意到，那阴影已经吞噬了之前还在其上的所有东西。它超出了跳跃范围，明日香知道，“使徒”不会受到伤害……但没人提过关于那阴影的事。

_All you need to do is to not die on me, Shinji. Just don't die and I'll show you what I can do. You'll see. I'll figure this out before they go ape and level the place.  
你只需要别死在我面前，真嗣。只要不死，我就会让你见识到我能做什么。你会看到的。我会在他们发疯摧毁这里之前解决这一切。_

Asuka reached for the nearest building and tore off a chunk from its side. As masonry and dust ran through the Evangelion's fingertips, she angled it, and chucked it straight into the shadow. All that accomplished was to feed the Dirac Sea another meaningless piece of wreckage.  
明日香伸手抓住最近的一栋建筑，从侧面撕下一大块。当砖石和尘埃从 EVA 的指间滑落时，她调整角度，将那块碎片直直扔向阴影。这一切只是给狄拉克海又添了一块无意义的残骸。

Asuka glanced at the countdown display, counting down Shinji's life support.  
明日香瞥了一眼倒计时显示器，那是真嗣生命维持系统的倒计时。

**00:00:17**

"Seventeen seconds..." "十七秒..."

She tried to think. Her mind was in a strange state, scattering her thoughts to trivial things, going on tangents when it was supposed to work on the problem.  
她试图思考。她的思维处于一种奇怪的状态，将她的思绪分散到琐碎的事物上，本应专注于解决问题时却偏离了正轨。

"Inverted A.T. Field... if two EVAs could cancel that, maybe I could only shift it? Find myself a way in?"  
"反转 A.T.力场...如果两台 EVA 能抵消它，也许我只能改变它？找到一条进入的路？"

**00:00:08**

"Damn it! God damn you!" Unit 02 shuffled its feet, stepping forward, stopping just short of the shadow's reach, "I'll... I'll...  
"该死！你这混蛋！" 二号机挪动脚步，向前迈进，停在阴影的边缘，"我... 我...

_There's nothing I can do. Oh, God, there's_ nothing.  
我无能为力。哦，天哪，我无能为力。

**00:00:06**

**00:00:03**

"Nothing, nothing, _nothing! Nothing! There's nothing!"_  
"无能为力，无能为力，无能为力！无能为力！我无能为力！"

**00:00:00**

_There's nothing. I failed. I failed.  
什么都没有。我失败了。我失败了。_

"I'm a failure. Even my father didn't want me. And no wonder, I screwed up again." He chuckled, "Maybe he'll be glad I'm dead."  
我是个失败者。连我父亲都不想要我。难怪，我又搞砸了。" 他苦笑道，"也许他会庆幸我死了。

_Your father praised you, once. That is a pleasant memory.  
你父亲曾夸奖过你，那是一段美好的回忆。_

Shinji's face lit up, only for a second.  
真嗣的脸亮了起来，只持续了一秒钟。

"Once." He said, "I remember... I'll never forget."  
“一次。”他说，“我记得……我永远不会忘记。”

_Do you live off of the recollection of whatever pleasures you find?  
你靠回忆找到的那些快乐来维持生活吗？_

"I have nothing else." “我别无他物。”

_I can't live this way. Not for long.  
我不能这样生活。不能长久。_

"If I could trust them, I could live... only to lie."  
"如果我能信任他们，我就能活...只为谎言而活。"

_You think this is deceiving yourself.  
你认为这是在欺骗自己。_

"Isn't it? People do that all the time. They lie to themselves. She does it, too."  
"难道不是吗？人们总是这样做。他们自欺欺人。她也一样。"

_She is important to you. Yet you're afraid to reach out to her.  
她对你很重要。然而你却害怕向她伸出手。_

"Why should I? She thinks I'm worthless. I thought she didn't, once..."  
“我为什么要这么做？她认为我一文不值。我曾以为她不是这样想的……”

_You cling to the memory of more pleasurable times, to ignore the pain in between. That's why the object is meaningless.  
你紧抓着那些更愉快的时光的记忆，以忽视其间的心痛。这就是为什么那个对象变得毫无意义。_

Shinji stared at the pieces of the SDAT player.  
真嗣盯着 SDAT 播放器的碎片。

"Mother's..." he said. “妈妈的……”他说。

_To keep her with you, to never be alone, to feel wanted by an inanimate object... this is what the object is. It is you, running away.  
为了让她与你同在，永不孤单，感受到一个无生命物体的需求……这就是那个物体的意义。是你，在逃避。_

"I'm not running..." Shinji said.  
"我不是在逃跑..." 真嗣说。

_From the object to something else, again, from one escape to the next. No-one can live as the sum of their hideouts, strung up in a rosary.  
从一个对象逃到另一个，再次，从一个避难所逃到下一个。没有人能以他们藏身之处的总和活着，像一串念珠一样被串起来。_

"But I finally found something. Something I could do, something others will thank me for doing. Something to make me more than just the kid who sleeps in the shed, the idiot... it's painful, it's hard, it hurts more than I can stand and I don't know how many times I wished I had died... but it's mine. It's mine and I want it. Is it so wrong to want it..? To want it like this..? To not be expandable, to not be replaceable, to be more than what I am to them..?"  
"但我终于找到了一些东西。一些我能做的，一些别人会感谢我做的事情。一些能让我不仅仅是那个睡在棚子里的孩子，那个傻瓜...这很痛苦，很难，比我能承受的还要痛苦，我不知道有多少次我希望自己死了...但这是我的。这是我的，我想要它。想要它有错吗..？像这样想要它..？不想被替代，不想被取代，想要比我在他们眼中的样子更进一步..?"

_Then, without it, you would not have an image of self. You would not exist.  
那样一来，你便没有自我形象。你将不复存在。_

"Oh, _fuck_ you!" Shinji snapped, "What do you know about it!? I'm-"  
“哦，去你的！”真嗣厉声回击，“你又懂什么！？我——”

Distant sensation of his body lurching, limbs spasming in unconscious desire to execute a series of futile moves that would do nothing to shield him from what was coming. He knew that the life support had just shut down completely.  
遥远的感觉中，他的身体猛然一震，四肢无意识地抽搐，试图执行一系列徒劳的动作，却无法为他抵挡即将到来的厄运。他知道生命维持系统刚刚彻底关闭了。

"It doesn't matter. I'm dead anyway."  
"没关系。反正我也死了。"

_You are not dead. 你还没死。_

"I will be, soon. I'll die in this one thing that I liked."  
"很快就会了。我会死在我喜欢的一件事上。"

_If it has died, you must have died, yet you are not dead. Why are you not dead? Why do you exist?  
如果它已逝去，你必已逝去，然而你并未死去。为何你不死？为何你存在？_

"I'm..." "我……"

**9**

Misato balefully beheld the digital countdown. In damning, red numbers, it displayed, -**00:05:45**. She grabbed the nearest seat and sat down. She faced away from Ritsuko and her ilk – knowing what they were about to do, hating the inevitability of it all, loathing the mission that came attached to it. It was one of the rare moments when the reality of what she was doing refused to relent, refused to leave room for hope.  
美里恶狠狠地盯着数字倒计时。在令人诅咒的红色数字中，它显示着：-00:05:45。她抓过最近的座位坐下。她背对着律子和她的同伙——明知他们即将做什么，痛恨这一切的不可避免，厌恶这项附带的任务。这是少数几个时刻之一，她所做之事的现实无情地拒绝让步，拒绝留下希望的空间。

"We'll wait for the timer to reach 8 minutes minus." Ritsuko said, "The plugsuit may give him a small boost, and make up for lost time. After that, we'll proceed. Is that okay, Misato?"  
"我们等到计时器还剩 8 分钟时再行动。" 律子说，"紧身衣或许能给他一点助力，弥补失去的时间。之后，我们就继续。这样可以吗，美里？"

Misato didn't respond. 美里没有回应。

"Misato..?" "美里..？"

"Yes." Misato said, "Yes, damn you. I'll ring Asuka and tell her to be ready."  
“是。”美里说，“该死的，是。我会打电话给明日香，让她准备好。”

**10**

Awareness of the entry plug, now completely dim, save for the nocturnal glow of his plugsuit. No air to breathe, no LCL to nurture him, the smell of blood and isolation filling his lungs, spreading throughout his body.  
意识到了插入栓的存在，现在完全暗淡，只剩下他驾驶服上的夜光。没有空气可呼吸，没有 LCL 滋养他，血腥味和孤独感充斥着他的肺部，蔓延至全身。

Track 25 in his ears and a familiar face... drawing closer...  
耳边是第 25 轨音乐，一张熟悉的面孔……越来越近……

_I can't breathe... I can't...  
我无法呼吸...我做不到..._

The woman in the next compartment of the train, entering theirs through the sliding door...  
隔壁车厢的女人，通过滑动门进入了他们的车厢...

_They left me here... they abandoned me... nobody's coming... nobody's coming for me...  
他们把我留在这里...他们抛弃了我...没有人来...没有人会来找我..._

Her face obscured by the sunlight... familiar...  
阳光遮住了她的脸...熟悉...

_They left me here to die... it's over. It's over.  
他们把我留在这里等死...结束了。一切都结束了。_

Bending over his, the face... unseen, never seen before and not seen now, but somehow letting him know it was full of... _love._  
俯身向他，那张脸...从未见过，此刻也未曾看见，但不知怎的让他知道，那脸上满是...爱意。

Shinji heard his own voice, far and wee.  
真嗣听到自己的声音，遥远而微弱。

"Mother..?" “妈妈……？”

**11**

Unit 02 chucked the Progressive Knife at the sphere – Asuka knew that it wouldn't do anything, only serve to further her frustration. She was shaking, her hands gripping the control bars so tight that she was hearing it groan under the pressure. Overhead, the first sorties of the JSSDF aircraft were visible, drawing lines on the sky. Getting ready to level the Angel. Moving into position to kill Shinji, to put the final nail in the coffin of her.  
二号机将高振动粒子刀掷向球体——明日香知道这无济于事，只会加剧她的挫败感。她颤抖着，双手紧握操纵杆，以至于能听到它在压力下发出的呻吟。头顶上，日本自卫队空军的第一波战机清晰可见，在天空中划出轨迹。准备摧毁使徒。进入位置，准备杀死真嗣，给她的命运钉上最后一颗钉子。

_You are not going to die, you stupid asshole... you are not going to die. I'll show you. I'll show you all!  
你不会死的，你这个蠢货……你不会死的。我会证明给你看。我会向你们所有人证明！_

Unit 02 was stationary. Asuka willed it to move. There was static in her head, static lacing the inside of the entry plug. Interference from something she couldn't see, couldn't dig deep enough to dig out.  
二号机静止不动。明日香努力让它移动。她的脑海中充满了静电噪音，驾驶舱内也布满了这种干扰。来自某种她看不见、无法深入挖掘并排除的东西。

**13**

"Fucking _move_!" Asuka said, "They can't bomb it if it's the two of us in there, move forward! Come on! You are my EVA, you will do what I say! Move, damn it, move! Move! MOVE!"  
"快滚开！" 明日香喊道，"如果只有我们两个在里面，他们就无法轰炸了，前进！快点！你是我的 EVA，你会照我说的做！动起来，该死的，动起来！动！动！"

The EVA was moving, after a fashion, but it seemed reluctant. All Asuka needed was two steps, but it wasn't complying with her command.  
EVA 在移动，虽然有些勉强，但显得很不情愿。明日香只需要两步，但它并没有服从她的命令。

Asuka, pulling frantically on the controls, didn't notice Rei come and take her position on the next avenue over. The operation and her part in it had completely disappeared, dissolved into the raging storm inside her. A comm-window opened and Rei's voice, cold and emotionless, broke through.  
明日香疯狂地拉动控制杆，没有注意到绫波零来到旁边的一条通道上。操作和她在这其中的角色已经完全消失，融化在她内心狂暴的风暴中。一个通讯窗口打开，绫波零那冷漠无情的声音穿透了进来。

"_Are you ready?"_ “准备好了吗？”

**12**

Rei saw, somewhere near the epicenter of the Angel, movement that looked like something was taking a picket axe to the ceiling of the Dirac Sea. The single-point rupture rapidly blossomed with spidering cracks, reaching out both from this point and beginning to appear on their own all over. The surface cracked, rapidly painted with criss-crossing fault lines, exposing a thin surface. 3 nanometers thick, and it was now bared for all to see.  
丽在使徒的核心附近看到了类似用尖镐敲击狄拉克海天花板的动静。单点破裂迅速绽放出蛛网般的裂纹，从这一点向外延伸，并在各处自行出现。表面裂开，迅速布满交叉的断层线，暴露出一个薄薄的表面。厚度仅 3 纳米，现在一览无余。

The Angel's spherical form shuddered, drawing the attention of Asuka and Rei towards it. It shuddered again. Without warning, a hand, contorted into a claw-like shape, burst out of the sphere, reaching out to the elbow, inviting spurts of blood with it. Asuka saw the liquid cake the hand, drip lazily from the fingers, dripping down...  
使徒的球形身躯颤抖着，吸引了明日香和丽的注意。它再次颤抖。毫无预警地，一只扭曲成爪状的手从球体中爆裂而出，伸至肘部，伴随着喷涌的血液。明日香看到液体覆盖了那只手，懒洋洋地从指间滴落……

The hand withdrew. Before their eyes, two sets of hands emerged from the top of the sphere and curled to grip it. A gash began to run down the side, cutting through the circular shapes as the sphere's top parted. A sound, reverberating, howling, began to echo, increasing as the hands pushed the sphere further and further, shaking with the strain.  
那只手缩了回去。在他们眼前，两组手从球体的顶部伸出，弯曲着抓住它。一道裂缝开始沿着侧面延伸，穿过圆形图案，球体的顶部逐渐分开。一种回荡、嚎叫的声音开始回响，随着双手不断推动球体，声音越来越大，因用力而颤抖。

With a disgusting sound of bone and flesh bending the wrong way, of ligaments snapping, both sides of the gash, near-perfect half-spheres, were parted, pushed aside as, before Asuka and Rei's watchful eyes and to the utter shock of those assembled in the war room, Unit 01 emerged.  
随着一阵令人作呕的骨头和肉体以错误方式弯曲、韧带断裂的声音，裂缝两侧近乎完美的半球体被分开，推到一旁，在明日香和绫波零的注视下，以及作战室里众人的极度震惊中，初号机出现了。

Covered from nose to sternum in blood, the Evangelion rose its head to the skies and howled, thick geysers of blood spurting out all across the gash from which it had emerged – that terrible, shaking sound, dripping with anger, lament and despair, vibrating in the throat of the hulking giant, shaking its abnormally large teeth as its mouth hung open, a piece of the jaw-lock hanging from its side, scattered into the air.  
从鼻尖到胸骨沾满鲜血，使徒抬起头向天空嚎叫，厚厚的血柱从它出现的裂缝中喷涌而出——那可怕的、颤抖的声音，充满了愤怒、哀叹和绝望，在巨人的喉咙中震动，摇晃着它异常巨大的牙齿，嘴巴张开，下颚锁的一块碎片挂在旁边，散落在空中。

The Evangelion screamed and screamed and screamed...  
那架福音战士尖叫着，尖叫着，尖叫着...

**13**

Misato felt her stomach churn at the sight, and from Maya, standing right next to her, turning white as a ghost, she saw that her response was something similar. Ritsuko, one hand still on the microphone's button, looked absolutely disturbed. The sound of the EVA's screaming had filled the room, and it kept on screaming, kept on screaming as if it was unleashing everything it was holding inside of itself for a long time.  
看到这一幕，美里感到胃里一阵翻腾，而站在她旁边的摩耶脸色苍白如鬼，她意识到摩耶的反应也差不多。律子一手还按在麦克风的按钮上，看上去极度不安。EVA 的尖叫声充斥着整个房间，它持续尖叫，持续尖叫，仿佛在释放长久以来积压在内心的一切。

"That's... Unit 01?" Misato managed, "That's the EVA?"  
“那是...01 号机？”美里勉强说道，“那是 EVA 吗？”

"Can we measure..." Ritsuko said, "Synchronization rate..?"  
"我们能测量..." 律子说，"同步率...？"

Maya forced herself to look away from the screen just as Unit 01, growling this time, ducked back into the Angel's "body", hands tearing chunks off of the gash. Maya's fingers clumsily danced across the pad, sending a remote signal to acquire the measurement Ritsuko had asked for. The calibration went underway quickly enough, just then, a gut-wrenching ripping sound, of flesh separating from flesh echoed through the war room. Maya looked out of the corner of her eye to see Unit 01 descending through the torn shreds of the Angel's sphere-shadow.  
真希波强迫自己从屏幕上移开视线，就在这时，零一号机再次咆哮着潜入使徒的"身体"，双手撕扯着裂口处的肉块。真希波笨拙地用手指在控制板上舞动，发送远程信号以获取律子所要求的测量数据。校准迅速进行，就在此时，一阵令人心悸的撕裂声，肉体分离的声音在作战室中回荡。真希波用眼角余光瞥见零一号机正穿过使徒球形阴影被撕裂的碎片中降下。

The screen bleeped. Maya's eyes widened.  
屏幕发出哔哔声。真希波的眼睛睁大了。

**14**

Asuka watched as Unit 01 landed straight onto the spot it had landed on before, during the attack. Pieces torn out of the Angel's sphere-shadow graced it both with a thick shower of blood and with themselves – one black piece hung onto the shoulder of the Evangelion, much like an animal pelt.  
明日香注视着零一号机直接降落在之前被攻击时着陆的地方。天使的球形阴影被撕裂的部分，既像一场浓稠的血雨，又像是它们自身——一块黑色的碎片挂在福音战士的肩上，宛如一张动物毛皮。

Asuka's stomach lurched, but she had nothing to throw up.  
明日香的胃一阵翻腾，但她没有什么可吐的。

"Am I... inside something... am I inside..."  
“我是不是……在什么东西里面……我是不是在……”

Unit 01's head snapped up and looked straight at her then. Through clenched teeth, it growled.  
初号机的头部猛地抬起，直直地盯着她。它紧咬牙关，发出低吼。

**15**

"What did you say?" Ritsuko asked, not taking her eyes off of the screen.  
“你说什么？”律子问道，目光依旧没有离开屏幕。

"It's..." Maya swallowed, "The synchronization rate is 360%."  
“这是……”玛雅咽了咽口水，“同步率是 360%。”

Misato snatched the microphone out of Ritsuko's hand and pressed the button so hard, she felt the button's slot scrape her finger.  
美里从律子手中夺过麦克风，用力按下按钮，感觉按钮槽刮到了她的手指。

"Shinji! Shinji, can you hear me? Shinji, please respond! _Shinji!_"  
“真嗣！真嗣，你能听到吗？真嗣，请回答！真嗣！”

### Chapter 12 Revengefuck

**Movement 11 第 11 乐章  
"Revengefuck" 复仇性爱**

**1**

**EVANGELION UNIT 02: SECOND CHILDREN  
福音战士初号机：第二适格者**

**SYNCHRONIZATION RATE: 18.2%  
同步率：18.2%**

**2**

Asuka couldn't react as Unit 01, letting out a guttural growl, sprung from where it was and leapt into the air. Tracing a graceful arc, it landed hard, mere meters from Unit 02. Panic gripped Asuka; shrinking away and pressing hard against the seat, she began to pull on the controls. The need for escape took over her entire being. There was nothing else left – she just wanted to get away from the monster in front of her.  
明日香还没来得及反应，零一号机便发出一声低沉的咆哮，从原地一跃而起，划出一道优美的弧线，重重地落在距离零二号机仅几米的地方。恐慌紧紧抓住了明日香；她缩成一团，紧紧贴着座椅，开始猛拉操纵杆。逃离的欲望占据了她的全部身心。除此之外别无他物——她只想逃离眼前这个怪物。

Unit 02 wasn't moving. 零二号机一动不动。

**3**

Ritsuko grabbed the microphone.  
律子抓起了麦克风。

"Rei! Defend Unit 02!" “丽！保护二号机！”

"_Understood."_ "明白了。"

Misato felt dizzy as Ritsuko gave the microphone back. Behind her, Maya, Shigure and Makoto were working up a storm, shouting technical nonsense as to how the EVA was even operating without battery or any internal power left.  
律子归还麦克风时，美里感到一阵眩晕。在她身后，真耶、时雨和真琴正忙得不可开交，大声讨论着技术细节，争论着 EVA 在没有电池或任何内部电源的情况下是如何运作的。

"He's on the brink of losing himself." Ritsuko said, "At this rate, the line between the EVA and his own self should be blurred... he's running the risk of disappearing, losing himself."  
"他正处在迷失自我的边缘。" 律子说，"照这样下去，EVA 和他自身之间的界限会变得模糊...他正冒着消失、失去自我的风险。"

"What can we do..?" "我们能做些什么呢..?"

"For now, let's hope Rei keeps it at bay... and that this state can't be sustained for long."  
"眼下，我们只能寄希望于绫波能控制住局面...并且这种状态无法持续太久。"

**4**

"Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, _move!"_ Asuka felt the controls wrench every time she pulled them as far back as they would go, desperately trying to get the EVA to make a move, to take a step back, away from this... _thing._  
“动啊，动啊，动啊，动啊，动啊，动啊，动啊，动啊！”明日香每次将操纵杆拉到极限，都感到一阵剧烈的牵引，她拼命地试图让 EVA 动起来，迈出一步，退后，远离这个……东西。

The curled fingers of Unit 01 jerked forward, the motion stopping as abruptly as it had began, and reached for Unit 02's throat. Asuka's eyes widened as she pulled, pulled and pulled, managing to elicit no reaction from her EVA. All she could hear was the growling, all she could see was the glowing eyes of the EVA, full of ill will...  
零一机体的蜷曲手指猛地向前一伸，动作突然停止，就像开始时一样突兀，伸向零二机体的喉咙。明日香瞪大了眼睛，拼命拉动，拉动再拉动，却无法让她的 EVA 做出任何反应。她只能听到咆哮声，只能看到 EVA 那充满恶意的炽热双眼……

"It won't move!" Asuka shrieked, _"It won't move!"_  
“动不了！”明日香尖叫道，“动不了！”

Unit 00 emerged from between Unit 01's extended arms, using its shoulder pylons to force the elbow joints to bend backwards, to which Unit 01 responded by pulling its arms back. Unit 02 stumbled back, by two shaky steps. Rei stood between her and Unit 01, Prog Knife drawn and in a combat stance. The moment lingered, Units 00 and 01 staring each other down. Gradually, the blood-soaked Unit 01 wound down, it seemed. It gently settled onto its knees, let its arms hang on the sides. Head bent down, the light faded from its eyes.  
零号机从初号机伸出的双臂间现身，利用肩部挂架迫使肘关节向后弯曲，初号机随之收回双臂。二号机踉跄后退，摇摇晃晃地迈了两步。绫波站在她和初号机之间，程序刀已出鞘，摆出战斗姿态。那一刻仿佛凝固，零号机与初号机对峙着。渐渐地，血迹斑斑的初号机似乎平静下来。它轻轻跪下，双臂垂在身侧。头低垂着，眼中的光芒逐渐黯淡。

Rei reached for the comm transmission the moment the spinal column of Unit 01 opened up and pushed the entry plug out.  
初号机脊椎打开，将插入栓推出的一瞬间，绫波伸手去接通讯传输。

**5**

Misato's foot was tapping on the grilled metal of the umbilical bridge, emitting a metallic sound with each strike of her boot's heel. A gurney was standing right beside her, along with three emergency residents. Emergency aid equipment, such as defibrillators and artificial breathers were stuffed into the space between the mattress and bottom railing of the gurney, all waiting to resuscitate Shinji Ikari... if he could be.  
美里在脐带桥的金属格栅上轻敲着靴跟，每一下都发出金属声响。她旁边立着一辆担架，还有三名急救医生。急救设备，如除颤器和人工呼吸器，塞满了担架床垫与护栏之间的空隙，一切准备就绪，只待抢救真嗣……如果他还有救的话。

Ritsuko was smoking calmly next to Misato, but it was easy to see her the minute furrowing of her brow, her reserved mannerism. Misato didn't bother with that particular distraction – not when she had claimed that the pilot's life wasn't important.  
律子平静地抽着烟，靠在美里旁边，但她眉间那一丝不易察觉的皱褶，以及她那内敛的举止，却显而易见。美里并未在意这一细节——毕竟，当她声称那位驾驶员的生命无关紧要时，她已无暇顾及这些。

The EVA unit, with the entry plug still exposed, was being maneuvered into its neutral position in the cage, ready to be locked in again. The heavy scent of blood and rotten meat had covered the bridge, and the EVA, Misato saw, was still drenched. With a shiver, she noticed that without the helmet, it looked like it was grinning madly with its eyes closed.  
EVA 机体连同插入栓仍暴露在外，正被移至笼中的中立位置，准备再次锁定。桥上弥漫着浓重的血腥与腐肉气息，美里看到，EVA 依旧湿漉漉的。她不禁打了个寒颤，注意到没有头盔的 EVA，闭着眼睛，仿佛在疯狂地咧嘴笑。

Slowly, Unit 01 was secured into place. The stench was unbearable by now, and Misato envied the paramedics for their surgical masks that would at least filter some of it.  
慢慢地，01 号机被固定到位。此刻的恶臭已让人难以忍受，美里羡慕起那些戴着手术口罩的医护人员，至少他们的口罩能过滤掉一部分气味。

"Let's go." Misato said, and, casting a sideways glance at Ritsuko, "Let's hope he's still alive."  
“我们走吧。”美里说道，同时斜眼瞥了一眼律子，“希望他还活着。”

**6**

At first, there was nothing. Just the silence, and the darkness. A sense of being beside himself, not being there at all. A distance that couldn't be bridged. Nothingness, if it was anything, had to be like this. Nothing.  
起初，什么都没有。只有寂静和黑暗。一种自我旁观的感觉，仿佛根本不在那里。一段无法弥合的距离。如果虚无是一种存在，那它一定是这样的。什么都没有。

Then, an echo. Echoes didn't exist in nothingness, did they? Nothing did, that was the point. But there it was. Something groaning. Something metal. A scraping sound, along with a clicking rotating sound. Sound existed in this nothingness. Who knew.  
然后，传来了一阵回声。回声在虚无中不存在，不是吗？这就是虚无的本质。但确实有声音。某种金属的呻吟声。摩擦声，伴随着咔嗒咔嗒的旋转声。声音存在于这片虚无之中。谁知道呢。

A light. So sharp and thin, it could cut through steel, it could cut through anything. Expanding, covering a larger area. Ah, the light at the end of the tunnel. What had Asuka said, once? It was his synapses firing as they died. He'd move closer and closer to it until the white-out washed his brain clean of his existence.  
一道光。如此锐利而纤细，能切穿钢铁，能切穿一切。扩散开来，覆盖更大的区域。啊，那隧道尽头的光亮。明日香曾说过什么来着？那是他的神经元在死亡中激发。他会一步步靠近它，直到那片白光将他的大脑洗刷得一干二净，抹去他的存在。

And there he was, being pulled closer. The last of him, excavated from the dead entry plug, a corpse. A maggot-ridden corpse, a dead thing. Him.  
而他就在那里，被拉得更近。从那死亡的插入栓中挖掘出的最后一部分，一具尸体。一具蛆虫缠身的尸体，一个死物。他。

Closer now, closer still, every moment he was getting closer... the light felt warm... unbelievably warm... pulling him in.  
现在更近了，依然在靠近，每一刻他都在接近...那光感觉温暖...难以置信的温暖...吸引着他。

Calling him home. 呼唤他回家。

**7**

Misato didn't remember the last time she had cried like this. With the paramedics insisting that she should let go of him, she was holding onto his body with all her strength. She could feel his body, lithe and weak and cold, she could feel his heart beating... his lungs expanding to draw in air and contracting as they released...  
美里不记得上次这样哭泣是什么时候了。尽管医护人员坚持让她放手，她还是用尽全力抱着他的身体。她能感觉到他的身体，纤细、虚弱、冰冷，她能感觉到他的心跳...他的肺部扩张吸入空气，又收缩着呼出...

_Thank God... Thank God... Thank God...  
感谢上帝...感谢上帝...感谢上帝..._

"Major, please." A paramedic said, "We really need to get him sorted."  
"少校，请。" 一名急救人员说，"我们真的需要尽快处理他。"

Misato withdrew reluctantly, but wouldn't let go of his hand. They put him on the gurney, began to hook him up to various devices. They took his hand from Misato to put on the heart monitor clip. Shinji looked delirious, his eyes turning in many directions, trying to catch a glimpse of where he was.  
美里不情愿地退开，但仍不肯放开他的手。他们将他放在担架车上，开始连接各种设备。他们从美里手中接过他的手，装上心电监护仪的夹子。真嗣看起来神志不清，眼睛四处转动，试图看清自己身处何地。

"It's alright." Misato whispered in his ear, "You're with us. You are safe now."  
"没事的。" 美里在他耳边低语，"你和我们在一起。你现在安全了。"

They took him away. Misato stared after him, a thousand worries in her head. Ritsuko came up to her side, snapping her right out of it.  
他们把他带走了。美里目送着他离去，脑海中千头万绪。律子走到她身边，一下子把她拉回了现实。

"I'm glad he's alive." She said, "I didn't want to kill him, Misato."  
“我很高兴他还活着。”她说，“我不想杀他，美里。”

"Save it." Misato said, "You can be so cold sometimes..."  
“省省吧。”美里说，“你有时候真是冷酷无情……”

"I suppose." "我想是的。"

"He's alive. That's what matters."  
"他还活着。这才是最重要的。"

"There is something else..." Ritsuko said, "...and it requires your attention."  
"还有别的事..." 律子说，"...需要你关注。"

"In a little while." Misato said, "I think I need a short break."  
"一会儿就好。" 美里说，"我想我需要稍微休息一下。"

"Alright. I'll be in my lab."  
"好的。我会在实验室里。"

Ritsuko left. Misato waited for her to get out of earshot to continue crying.  
律子离开了。美里等她走远听不见了，才继续哭泣。

**EVANGELION UNIT 02: SECOND CHILDREN  
福音战士初号机 02：第二适格者**

**SYNCHRONIZATION RATE: 0% 同步率：0%**

"Sync rate... zero percent." Asuka murmured to herself.  
"同步率...零百分比。" 明日香喃喃自语道。

While Shinji was being settled into the medical wing on the upper floors, Asuka was sitting next to her EVA. Unit 02 had been settled into the cage some time ago, and she had been extracted. Ever since then, she had sat there, holding her knees. The scant few technicians that passed her by went about their business as if she wasn't even there. There were a lot of them around, scurrying about to do this and that, stupid little details only technicians handled.  
当真嗣被安置在高层的医疗翼时，明日香正坐在她的 EVA 旁边。二号机早已被安置在笼子里，而她也被抽离出来。从那时起，她就一直坐在那里，抱着膝盖。偶尔经过她的寥寥几个技术人员，都像她不存在一样忙着自己的事情。周围有很多人，四处奔波，处理着只有技术人员才会关心的琐碎细节。

Every once in a while, she'd catch a word or two. She'd understand what they were talking about, identify familiar terms. None of them felt like they meant anything.  
偶尔，她会捕捉到一两个词。她能理解他们在谈论什么，识别出熟悉的术语。但这些都感觉毫无意义。

Asuka didn't move for a long time. Inside, the water was rising. She couldn't swim against the undercurrent dragging her down – humans weren't meant to float. It would engulf her soon, if it already hadn't. There was the pale, lifeless lights of the ceiling above, belonging to some kind of heaven, she guessed, and underneath her, the ice cold certainty of hell.  
明日香长时间没有动弹。内心深处，水位在上升。她无法抵抗将自己拖入深渊的暗流——人类本就不该漂浮。很快，它就会吞没她，如果还没有的话。头顶上是苍白、无生气的灯光，属于某种天堂，她猜测，而脚下则是冰冷的地狱般的确定感。

_Zero percent... I'm nothing.  
零分...我什么都不是。_

"_...she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round to look up in her face..."_  
...她成功地将它的身体塞到腋下，腿悬垂着，大体上还算舒适。正当她好不容易把它的脖子理顺，准备用它的头给刺猬来一下时，它却非要扭过头来，仰望着她的脸...

This was new. She wasn't used to hearing her own voice so much. The most she ever talked was if the Commander ever pulled her in for lunch, often giving her small pieces of his life as tokens of his appreciation. He didn't have to, as his orders meant she'd do it.  
这倒是新鲜事。她不习惯听到自己如此频繁地说话。最多的时候，她只是在指挥官邀请她共进午餐时才会多说几句，指挥官常会分享一些他生活中的小事以示感谢。其实他不必如此，因为他的命令本身就意味着她会照做。

She wasn't used to reading to someone, either, let alone the second Ikari in her life. She was taken off standby, and he was injured. It had seemed the most natural thing to do, to do what she had done before, only this time without being ordered to: Watch over him.  
她也不习惯给别人读书，更别提是她生命中的第二位碇君了。她被取消了待命状态，而他受了伤。对她来说，做她以前做过的事似乎是最自然不过的，只是这次没有被命令：照顾他。

_Second or third time now, I am the someone to watch over him.  
这已经是第二次或第三次了，我是那个要照顾他的人。_

Rei had chosen the book because it was on the subject of dreams, and because it was the only book she had in her duffel bag in the changing room. She had deemed it appropriate, because he, most likely, would be dreaming. Rei didn't dream, not exactly. She had been told by Dr. Akagi that the incomplete, unlinked images that every once in a while littered her sleep may have been dreams. But lately, she had been "dreaming", if it could be called that, more regularly. All of them seemed to feature him on the forefront. Him, his father's gloves and glasses, two fingers to push the lenses back to the correct position. At some point, she'd always tell him to take them off, that he didn't need them, but always feel that the real reason was because they looked unbecoming, inappropriate.  
绫波选择这本书是因为它关于梦境，而且这是她在更衣室的行李袋里唯一的一本书。她认为这本书很合适，因为他很可能会做梦。绫波并不真正做梦。赤木博士告诉她，偶尔在她睡眠中出现的那些不完整、未连接的图像可能是梦。但最近，她“做梦”的频率更高了，如果那可以称之为梦的话。所有的梦似乎都以他为主角。他，他父亲的 gloves 和 glasses，用两根手指把镜片推回正确的位置。在某个时刻，她总是会告诉他摘下眼镜，说他不需要它们，但总是觉得真正的原因是因为它们看起来不合适，不恰当。

She had been frustrated by the elusive nature of these episodes, so she had requested a book about dreams. The one that passed Dr. Akagi's test was the one she was reading to Shinji. Maybe through this, she had thought, she would be able to understand how he and her dreams were connected.  
她对这些难以捉摸的片段感到沮丧，因此她请求了一本关于梦境的书。通过赤木律子博士测试的那本，正是她读给真嗣听的。也许通过这个，她曾想，她能够理解他和她的梦境是如何联系在一起的。

Rei glanced at him. He seemed so at peace, as if merely sleeping. The I.V. hooked into his arm was just a cautionary measure. The various monitors at the head of his bed were beeping regularly – his heart was beating steadily. He was naked underneath the covers, she knew, a fact that somehow made her feel a warmer inside. She had been in this position before, but then, she hadn't really looked at him.  
绫波看了他一眼。他看起来如此平静，仿佛只是睡着了。插在他手臂上的静脉注射只是预防措施。床头各种监测仪规律地哔哔作响——他的心跳稳定。她知道，他在被子下是赤裸的，这个事实不知怎的让她内心感到一阵温暖。她曾处于过这种位置，但那时，她并没有真正注视过他。

_Every face is distinct. Something to separate you from the others. An identifier. Patterns on a surface, recognized by the fusiform gyrus, responsible for various forms of recognition. Familiarity.  
每张面孔都是独特的。这是将你与其他人区分开来的东西。一个标识符。表面的图案，由负责各种识别形式的梭状回所识别。熟悉感。_

_His face is pleasant. It ties in with my other senses. Without touching, I can recall the smooth texture of his cheek. I know that his eyes are blue, the kind of blue that recalls the memory of clear skies. His scent is distinctively that of LCL, mixed with elements of his own. His voice, the frequency of which is so different in its reverberation than that of the other Ikari in my life... his voice is pleasant to my ears. All this familiarity I can't express... does it mean something? Is it supposed to?  
他的面容令人愉悦。这与我的其他感官相契合。无需触碰，我便能回忆起他脸颊的光滑质感。我知道他的眼睛是蓝色的，那种让人想起晴朗天空的蓝色。他的气味独特，混合着 LCL 和他自身的气息。他的声音，其回响频率与我生命中的其他碇截然不同……他的声音悦耳动听。这一切的熟悉感我无法表达……这是否意味着什么？它应该是这样的吗？_

The heart monitor was beeping contentedly.  
心率监测器正满意地发出哔哔声。

Asuka crawled through the corridors. The base was a maze and she felt like a rat. Probably looked like one, too, she thought. Her steps were uneven, her feet shuffling, and she had little awareness of where she was going. She had in her left hand seven different item requisition forms, all for an SDAT player. Carried in her clenched fist, the pages gave the appearance of a crushed scroll. She had asked for, begged for and in one instance forcibly extracted the forms, all of which was a bit of a blur. A tooth stuck in her right fist was the only confirmation she had that yes, that annoying fucking pencil-pusher had bled all over his share.  
明日香在走廊里爬行。基地如同迷宫，她感觉自己像只老鼠。或许看起来也像，她想。她的步伐不稳，双脚拖沓，对前进的方向几乎毫无意识。她左手拿着七张不同的物品申请表，全都是为了一个 SDAT 播放器。紧握在拳头中的纸张，看起来像是一卷被压皱的卷轴。她请求过、乞求过，甚至有一次强行索取了这些表格，整个过程有些模糊。她右拳中紧握的一颗牙齿，是她唯一能确认的证据——没错，那个该死的讨厌鬼文书员确实流了不少血。

_Whatever. 随便吧。_

_You're burning the candle at both ends, Asuka-chan. You're burning out.  
你这是在两头烧蜡烛，明日香。你会燃尽自己的。_

_Fuck you. Let me burn out, then. Who gives a fuck anymore?  
去你的。那就让我燃尽吧。谁他妈还在乎这些？_

**11**

A familiar ceiling, white. Light fixture at the bottom of his vision, dead center – currently emitting a bright halo. He only had to begin looking around a room he had become familiar with when he found, instead, Rei's face as he had never seen it before: curious. Curious about something that lived behind his eyes, it seemed. He couldn't help but smile. This wasn't the first time he was waking up with her watching over him, and he was glad, now as he was then, that she was here.  
一个熟悉的白色天花板，视野正中央是那盏灯具，此刻正散发着明亮的光环。他刚要开始打量这个已熟悉的房间，却意外地看到了 Rei 的脸，那是一种他从未见过的表情：好奇。似乎对藏在他眼后的某种东西感到好奇。他不禁微笑起来。这不是他第一次醒来时发现她在守望着他，而现在，就像那时一样，他很高兴她在这里。

"You're awake." Rei said, as if that in and of itself was a curiosity.  
“你醒了。”Rei 说道，仿佛这本身就是一件令人好奇的事。

"I didn't die, did I?"  
“我没死吧？”

"No. You are still alive."  
"不，你还活着。"

"I'm glad." "我很高兴。"

Rei's puzzlement grew. It was clear to read, to a degree that surprised even Shinji.  
丽越发困惑。这种情绪清晰可见，甚至让真嗣都感到惊讶。

"I think I was dreaming." Shinji said.  
"我想我是在做梦。" 真嗣说。

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

"Do you dream?" "你会做梦吗？"

The question caught her off-guard, and she physically backed away a few centimeters.  
这个问题让她措手不及，她下意识地向后退了几厘米。

"I suppose I do." She said, "Everyone does."  
"我想我是这样。" 她说，"每个人都是这样。"

"I never dream." Shinji said, "But I guess, things change."  
"我从不做梦。" 真嗣说，"但我想，事情总会变的。"

He smiled. 他笑了。

"Thank you for watching over me."  
"谢谢你照顾我。"

A hesitant silence, and then...  
一阵犹豫的沉默，然后...

The door bleeped lightly and slid open, hissing. Two steps into the room, Asuka, unseen by both, froze, crushed forms in hand.  
门轻轻地哔了一声，嘶嘶作响地滑开。阿斯克走进房间，未被双方察觉，手中紧握着被压碎的形状，僵住了。

"You're welcome." “不客气。”

Rei found that she, too, was smiling. He had seen that smile before, which made his grow wider. The door slid back closed and the lock emitted a loud clacking sound, as the clamp slid into place.  
丽发现自己也在微笑。他之前见过那个微笑，这让他的笑容更加灿烂。门再次滑回关闭，锁发出一声响亮的咔嗒声，夹子滑入到位。

**12**

Shinji was the first to notice her. How kind of him, at least he pretended to give a shit. The look of embarrassment crossing his face was the final confirmation, his sudden need to half-heartedly tidy himself up (doomed to failure due to his lack of coordination and the need to actually do so) the last straw, his feeble attempt to prop himself up on his elbows the final insult.  
真嗣是第一个注意到她的。他至少假装在乎，真是太好了。他脸上的尴尬表情是最后的确认，他突然半心半意地整理自己的需要（由于缺乏协调和实际需要而注定失败）是最后一根稻草，他无力地试图用肘部支撑自己则是最后的侮辱。

Something in Asuka's head snapped and in that moment, everything came crashing down.  
在那一刻，明日香脑海中的某根弦突然断裂，一切都在瞬间崩塌。

Rei barely had time to react before Asuka's fist collided with her head, rattling her teeth and making her lose all sense of direction as the impact threw her off of her chair. Before she could react, Asuka was on her, her foot raised to strike her stomach cavity. Rei let out a strangled yelp and doubled over, which didn't stop the redhead's assault. The blows kept coming.  
零几乎没有时间反应，明日香的拳头就已击中她的头部，震得她牙齿咯咯作响，失去方向感，被冲击力掀翻在地。她还没来得及反应，明日香已经扑了上来，脚抬起准备攻击她的腹部。零发出一声窒息般的尖叫，弯腰蜷缩，但这并未阻止红发少女的攻击，拳头依旧如雨点般落下。

"You don't save me! You don't move me! You don't hold me back! _You're not even alive!_"  
“你救不了我！你动不了我！你阻止不了我！你甚至不是活人！”

"_Stop!"_ Shinji forced his body to let him rise, let him move. The bed sheets fell away from him as he managed to get his feet underneath him. He felt the cool air of the room against his foreskin and shivered to it. He shrugged it off. No. Let him be naked, let him be shamed – it didn't matter. Two feet from him, Asuka was flurry of strikes, all meant to hurt a balled up, shivering Rei.  
“住手！” 真嗣强迫自己的身体站起来，移动。床单从他身上滑落，当他设法让双脚支撑住自己时。他感受到房间里凉爽的空气拂过他的包皮，不禁打了个寒颤。他甩开这种感觉。不，让他赤裸，让他感到羞耻——这都不重要。离他两英尺远的地方，明日香正猛烈地攻击着，所有动作都是为了伤害那个蜷缩着、颤抖着的丽。

"I said _stop!"_ Shinji slid his arms under Asuka's armpits and grabbed hold of her neck. Pulling with his elbows, he tried to drag her out of range. Asuka's head jerked forward and then smashed back, flat against his nose, and the sudden jolt of pain across his skull blinded him. His grip slackened as spots danced in front of his eyes. Asuka broke his hold and turned.  
“我说了住手！” 真嗣从明日香的腋下伸出手臂，抓住她的脖子。他用肘部发力，试图将她拖出攻击范围。明日香的头猛地向前一甩，然后重重地向后撞，正好击中他的鼻子，突如其来的疼痛让他眼前一黑。他的抓握力减弱，眼前闪烁着光点。明日香挣脱了他的控制，转过身来。

In that split-second interim where Shinji stood eye-to-eye with her, he saw nothing but pure hatred in her eyes.  
在那短暂的对峙中，真嗣与她四目相对，他看到的只有她眼中纯粹的憎恨。

Asuka's hands shot forward, mimicking the motion Unit 01 had made earlier that day, and found his throat. She moved forward, pushing him down. She climbed on top of him, straddling him, and her thumbs pressed down his windpipe. Shinji's hands locked on her wrists, trying to pull her off. His fingers slid on the slick fabric of the plugsuit. His lungs were screaming for much more air than he was getting. He could feel her hands tremble as she choked him.  
明日香的手猛地向前一伸，模仿着那天零一号机早些时候的动作，抓住了他的喉咙。她向前逼近，将他推倒。她跨坐在他身上，双腿夹紧，拇指压在他的气管上。真嗣双手紧扣她的手腕，试图将她拉开。他的手指在插座服的光滑面料上滑过。他的肺部急需比现在更多的空气。他能感觉到她的手在他窒息时颤抖。

"You!" she snarled, "It's you! What's the point of you, huh, Shinji Ikari!? Why are _you_ alive!?"  
“你！”她咆哮道，“就是你！你有什么意义，碇真嗣！？你为什么还活着！？”

"A...suk...a... st... sto..."  
“明...日...香...停...停下...”

No air. No breath. No escape. She would be seen. She would be heard.  
没有空气，没有呼吸，无处可逃。她会被看见，她会被听见。

"You don't get the best of me." Asuka said, leaning closer, "You're not my better. Not my equal! You can never be that, _never!_ That's why you can't save me – You can't! _You are not_ _good enough to help me!_" Brief release of the constricting grip allowed him to fill his lungs with blessed air, a second before her lips clamped onto his, her tongue sharply scraping across his. She withdrew, turned her head, and spat on the floor, "See? See how easy it is!? Who wants to kiss you? Who the hell even wants you!?" her grip tightened, "Who'd be disgusting enough to even want you!? Who the fuck _are_ you, goddamn it? You're nothing! You're just a big bright _nothing!_"  
“你得不到最好的我。”明日香说着，身体更靠近了些，“你不是我的对手，不是我的平等！你永远做不到，永远！这就是为什么你救不了我——你不行！你没有足够好来帮我！”她短暂地松开了紧握的手，让他得以吸入那宝贵的空气，紧接着她的嘴唇紧贴上他的，舌头尖锐地刮过他的。她退开，转过头，朝地板吐了一口，“看到了吗？看到这有多容易了吗？！谁会想吻你？谁他妈的会想要你！？”她的握力加强了，“谁会恶心到想要你！？你他妈的到底是谁，该死的？你什么都不是！你只是一个大大的、闪亮的虚无！”

Shinji twisted his neck, bucked his hips in attempt to throw her off. He couldn't get a good grip to use his hands. She was like judgment on top of him – he was writhing underneath her, being crushed by her weight.  
真嗣扭动着脖子，试图用臀部将她甩开。他找不到好的抓手来使用双手。她就像审判一样压在他身上——他在她身下扭动，被她的重量压垮。

"Asu... ka..." “麻...衣...”

"You, you, you, _why?_ Why is it you!? I don't need anyone! Do you hear me, Shinji Ikari!? I don't need anyone else! _I don't need you!_"  
“你，你，你，为什么？为什么是你！？我不需要任何人！你听到了吗，碇真嗣！？我不需要任何人！我不需要你！”

In that moment, Shinji saw her. The room faded, Rei's painful whimpering breaking through as other sounds dissolved. He felt his fingers slip in through the small gaps left in her grip, gently holding her hands. She was still shouting, the vibrations made by her voice covered his face, as if her words were droplets of rain, soaking him. He saw her as she was, and his heart broke.  
那一刻，真嗣看到了她。房间的景象逐渐淡去，丽痛苦的呻吟声穿透其他声音传来。他感觉到自己的手指从她紧握的缝隙中滑入，轻轻握住她的手。她仍在喊叫，声音的震动覆盖了他的脸庞，仿佛她的话语是雨滴，浸透了他。他看到了真实的她，他的心碎了。

_I'm sorry. 对不起。_

### Chapter 13 Cupola

**Movement 12 第十二乐章  
"Cupola" 穹顶**

**1**

_I want to help you somehow.  
我想以某种方式帮助你。_

_I'm not good enough for that now, but I can be, someday. I want to be.  
我现在还不够好，但总有一天我会变得足够好。我渴望那一天的到来。_

_Don't hurt me anymore. Aren't you tired of the pain? I am.  
别再伤害我了。你不厌倦这痛苦吗？我已厌倦。_

_Don't push me away anymore. Don't shut me out anymore. I want to reach out to you. I want to catch your hand.  
别再推开我了。别再把我拒之门外。我想向你伸出援手。我想握住你的手。_

_But I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the pain, afraid of being lonely. I'm afraid that if I reach out, I'll find nothing to touch. I'm afraid that if I touch you, you'll break my hand and leave me alone with my broken wish.  
但我害怕。我害怕痛苦，害怕孤独。我害怕如果我伸出手，会发现没有什么可以触碰。我害怕如果我触碰你，你会折断我的手，让我独自带着破碎的愿望。_

_But I'm still here, aren't I?  
但我依然在这里，不是吗？_

_When you look at me, I don't know what you see. I don't know why it's not good enough. Maybe it's because I am myself. But you didn't discard me. You stuck around. I hope it'll be something good, what you see when you look, something that I am... or can be.  
当你看着我时，我不知道你看到了什么。我不知道为什么这还不够好。也许是因为我就是我自己。但你没有抛弃我。你一直在我身边。我希望当你看着我时，你能看到一些美好的东西，一些我本就是...或可以成为的东西。_

_Because I see you, and you're killing me. You're murdering me.  
因为我看到了你，你正在让我窒息。你正在将我置于死地。_

_Is that what you need..?  
这就是你所需要的吗..？_

_Is that what you need from me..?  
这就是你从我这里需要的吗..？_

**2**

A breath, at long last. Every single particle of air rushing through and expanding the lungs prominent, the natural process made almost painful by prolonged absence. The gasp heard was just the prelude to the harrowing cough, feeling as if it was tearing chunks off of lungs, beginning the cycle of not-enough-air and just-enough-air.  
终于，呼吸了一口气。每一粒空气都急速涌入并扩张着突出的肺部，这个自然过程因长时间的缺失而变得几乎痛苦。那声喘息只是骇人咳嗽的前奏，感觉像是要从肺里撕下一块块碎片，开始了空气不足与刚好足够的循环。

Noose around his neck, purple bruising that'd linger for some time, marking a time when it had choked him.  
脖子上套着绳索，紫色的淤痕将久久不散，标记着它曾令他窒息的时刻。

Breathless. Thrashing in place, head ringing, chest and throat racked with coughs, eyes seeing blind, no direction in the world.  
喘不过气来。在原地挣扎，脑袋嗡嗡作响，胸口和喉咙被咳嗽折磨，眼睛看不清，世界没有方向。

Movement, little ways away. Cool, sterilized air running between his legs, briefly reminding him of his nudity before pushing it to the back rows of his awareness. Then it rises, the sight.  
细微的动静，不远处传来。清凉、消毒过的空气在他双腿间流动，短暂地提醒了他一丝不挂的状态，随即又将这念头推到了意识的后排。接着，景象升起。

Bloody eye. Cut across the brow, bleeding into the eye that was swollen and shut. Pale cheek bruised, veins around the impact point spidering out, purple and dark red. The other eye, unharmed and squinting, was also blood red, the natural color of the iris recalling the vitae.  
血染的眼眸。眉骨处被割伤，血流进那只肿胀闭合的眼睛。苍白的脸颊上淤青一片，冲击点周围的血管如蛛网般蔓延，紫红交织。另一只未受伤的眼睛眯着，同样是血红色，虹膜的自然色泽让人联想到血液。

"Aya..." Shinji felt the words strain his throat, causing him to cough roughly, "...Rei?"  
“Aya...” 真嗣感到喉咙被话语拉扯，让他粗声咳嗽，“...丽？”

"You're alive." Rei said, her words strained, her swollen, cut lips making it painful to speak, "I..." a little more movement and she winced, her shoulders hunching by instinct, trying to relax the strain. She touches her side. It feels painful, the prospect of poking at her own body.  
"你还活着。" 丽说道，声音因痛苦而紧绷，她肿胀割伤的嘴唇让说话变得艰难，"我……" 稍一动弹，她就皱起了眉头，肩膀本能地弓起，试图缓解压力。她触摸着自己的侧腹。那感觉很痛，触碰自己的身体让她感到不安。

"Are you..." _of course she's not,_ "...call someone. We should..."  
"你……" 当然她没有，"……叫人。我们应该……"

Rei pointed at something behind him. Shinji turned to see the call button, red and gleaming. He reached over, coughing, and pressed it. Rei half-sat on the bed, one hand hovering over her side, where she could feel the ribs that were fractured. Shinji saw bruises on her hand, as well – one finger was bent the wrong way. He shivered.  
丽指了指他身后。真嗣转身看到呼叫按钮，鲜红而闪亮。他伸手过去，咳嗽着按下了它。丽半坐在床上，一只手悬在侧腹，那里她能感觉到断裂的肋骨。真嗣看到她手上的瘀伤，还有一根手指弯曲得不对劲。他打了个寒颤。

"I'm... sorry..." "我...很抱歉..."

"This isn't your doing." "这不是你的错。"

"...I can't... help more..."  
"...我无法...提供更多帮助..."

"You're not a doctor." "你不是医生。"

"Well... no. I'm no... not."  
"嗯... 是的。我不是... 不是医生。"

They sat quietly, waiting for the nurse to come. Shinji was wheezing, breathing wasn't easy yet, and Rei was twitching with every breath as her ribs sent jolts of thin agony across her body.  
他们静静地坐着，等待护士的到来。真嗣喘息着，呼吸仍然不顺畅，而绫波则随着每一次呼吸抽搐，她的肋骨在她体内引发一阵阵微弱的剧痛。

That was when he heard it. Shinji realized then the knocked-over cabinet by the door, the tissue box once sitting atop it resting on the floor. The color red succeeded the line set by the toppled furniture, leading into the corner of the room – a body gloved inside a red plugsuit... limbs limp, slumped against the corner. Expressionless blue eyes, almost glazed over, staring off into the distance.  
就在那时，他听到了。真嗣意识到门口倒下的柜子，原本放在上面的纸巾盒现在躺在地板上。红色线条紧随倾倒的家具，延伸至房间的角落——一具身穿红色插入栓服的身体……四肢无力，瘫靠在角落。无表情的蓝色眼睛，几乎呆滞，凝视着远方。

Two nurses burst in through the door.  
两名护士冲进门来。

Shinji saw that Asuka's lower lip was twitching. It almost looked like she was saying something... one word.  
真嗣看到明日香的嘴唇在颤抖。看起来她好像在说什么……一个词。

**3**

Misato slumped next to Shinji on the hospital bed, who had only wrapped the sheets around his waist for modesty's sake, as two nurses propped a delirious Asuka onto a wheelchair. They silently carted her out, one of them glancing at Misato only to receive a hand wave telling her that it was alright. Rei had been wheeled away also, and Shinji was trying hard to interpret the words "internal bleeding" as only a possibility – he kept telling himself that they did not have X-Ray vision to decide that from outside of her.  
美里瘫坐在真嗣旁边的病床上，真嗣为了遮羞只将床单裹在腰间，两名护士正将神志不清的明日香扶上轮椅。她们默默地将她推走，其中一人瞥了美里一眼，只得到一个挥手示意她没事。绫波也被推走了，真嗣努力将“内出血”这个词理解为一种可能性——他不断告诉自己，他们没有 X 光透视眼，无法从外部判断这一点。

Breathing was still difficult; speaking, even more so. It felt like a razor wire noose had to be tightened around his neck in order for any word to be spoken. Recalling the state Rei was in, which, he guessed, would put her in bandages not unlike when he had first seen her, Shinji couldn't help but feel a bit lucky. He loathed himself for that small quarter given - he hadn't been able to prevent any of it.  
呼吸依然困难；说话更是如此。感觉就像必须收紧一根剃刀般锋利的钢丝绳索，才能说出任何一个字。回想起绫波的状态，他猜测那会让她缠上绷带，就像他第一次见到她时那样，真嗣不禁感到一丝庆幸。他为自己那小小的庆幸感到厌恶——他没能阻止这一切的发生。

Misato sighed heavily and ran a hand through her hair. She sat there, rubbing her temples with one hand, the other one a clenched fist on her lap. Her breathing was ragged, almost as if she was the one who had just been strangled almost to death.  
美里重重地叹了口气，用手梳理着头发。她坐在那里，一只手揉着太阳穴，另一只手紧握成拳放在膝上。她的呼吸急促，几乎像是刚刚被人掐得差点窒息。

"What's going..." all he could manage was a hoarse whisper, "...to happen... to her..?"  
"会发生...什么..." 他只能发出嘶哑的低语，"...她会...怎样？""

"They'll keep us posted, but otherwise, I'm guessing, x-rays." Misato said, "A whole folder of them. She says her ribs are fractured, so they have to watch out for internal bleeding. The eye... well, I just hope..."  
"他们会随时通知我们，但除此之外，我猜，应该是拍 X 光片。" 美里说，"一整套的。她说她的肋骨骨折了，所以得留意内出血。至于眼睛...唉，我只希望..."

"I meant... Asuka." "我是说...明日香。""

"Oh." Misato was silent, "The Commander's still not back yet. Ultimately, it'll be his decision."  
"哦。" 美里沉默了，"指挥官还没回来。最终，这得由他决定。"

Shinji felt his blood run cold at the suggestion.  
听到这个建议，真嗣感到血液都凝固了。

"For now, she's off to the psych unit. She also attacked someone in the Requisitions Department... for... well, that's not important. In any case, they'll keep her under observation. I don't know for how long, God... it's all a mess."  
"目前，她被送往心理部门。她还袭击了物资部的某个人... 呃，那个原因不重要。总之，他们会对她进行观察。我不知道要多久，天啊... 一切都乱套了。"

"Mis... ato..."

"I'm a total failure as a guardian."  
"我作为监护人真是彻底失败。"

"Don't say that." "别这么说。"

"Anyway. I'll probably be demoted. Best case."  
"无论如何。我大概会被降职。最好的情况了。"

"Can they..." "他们能..."

Misato nodded. 美里点了点头。

"The Angel, the first predicted one, how it went... nearly losing you, Asuka's... this whole thing happened under my watch. I'm the one who's accountable."  
"那个天使，第一个被预测到的，它的出现...差点失去你，明日香的情况...这一切都发生在我眼皮底下。我是那个要负责的人。"

Shinji didn't know what to say.  
真嗣不知道该说什么。

"I should've seen it coming. I should've... but it's too late now, anyway."  
“我本该预见到的。我本该……但无论如何，现在都太迟了。”

She stood up. 她站了起来。

"I'll get you some clothes." She said, "You heard what they said, right?"  
“我去给你拿些衣服。”她说，“你听到了他们说的，对吧？”

Shinji nodded. There'd be bruising. His throat would be swollen, speaking, eating and drinking would be painful for a couple of days to a week... nothing more. There'd also be the inevitable round of psych eval, but considering everything else, he thought it'd be a breeze.  
真嗣点点头。会有淤青。他的喉咙会肿起来，说话、吃喝都会疼上几天到一周...仅此而已。还会有不可避免的心理评估，但考虑到其他一切，他认为这不过是小菜一碟。

"Good." “好。”

Misato wrapped her arms around Shinji and pulled him into a tight embrace. Lost in the folds of her jacket, Shinji could do nothing but return the gesture. It felt warm, as it always did. Warm and soft. When Misato let go, she reached over and clicked the red button.  
美里紧紧抱住真嗣，将他拉入怀中。真嗣被她的夹克包裹着，只能回以拥抱。一如既往地温暖而柔软。当美里松开手时，她伸手按下了红色按钮。

"Let them do the work." She said, one hand ruffling up his hair, "I nearly lost you twice in one day. I'm not letting you out of my sight."  
"“让他们去做吧。”她一边说，一边用一只手揉乱了他的头发，“我今天差点两次失去你。我不会再让你离开我的视线。”

**4**

The car ride back home was silent. There was only the revving of the engine, the subtle, faint sound of tires rolling over asphalt, and the scenery Shinji had practically memorized the progression of, from the many evenings when Misato had driven them back home. They made a small detour upon Shinji's insistence. Misato waited in the car while Shinji, wearing an old scarf Misato had forgotten in the back seat around his neck, told Hikari that Asuka had been injured during training, and that while it wasn't too serious, they wanted to keep her under observation. He said he'd tell her about visiting her - policy and all that. Hikari told him to pass her best wishes, that she'd write if she couldn't be there. Shinji assured her that he'd pass it on – he was a pilot, they had to let him in.  
"回家的车程静悄悄的。只有引擎的轰鸣声，轮胎轻轻滚过柏油路的微弱声响，以及真嗣几乎已经熟记于心的沿途风景，这些在无数个晚上美里开车带他们回家时他都见过。在真嗣的坚持下，他们绕了个小弯。美里在车里等着，而真嗣则围着一条美里遗忘在后座的旧围巾，告诉光子明日香在训练中受了伤，虽然不太严重，但他们希望对她进行观察。他说他会告诉她关于探望的事——政策之类的。光子让他转达她的祝福，如果她不能去的话，她会写信。真嗣向她保证会转达——他是个驾驶员，他们得让他进去。”

Misato didn't quite understand why Shinji wanted to make her excuses right out the gates, but felt that this was one of the things she didn't have to completely understand. It meant something to him, and that was enough. Shinji didn't take the scarf off after he got back in, and was completely silent for the rest of the way.  
美里并不完全明白为什么真嗣一进门就想为她找借口，但她觉得有些事情不必完全理解。这对他来说意义重大，这就足够了。真嗣回来后没有摘下围巾，一路上完全沉默。

Misato led Shinji into the apartment, now carrying the scent of a house that had been locked up while its owners were on vacation. PenPen's protestations came soon after the penguin's greetings, informing them that the fridge was almost empty. Once that situation was taken care of due to Shinji making the best of what was there, the contented animal took to wandering around them, curious as to why they were moving circles around one another.  
美里领着真嗣进入公寓，空气中弥漫着主人度假时紧锁家门的气息。很快，PenPen 的抗议声随之而来，告诉他们冰箱几乎空了。由于真嗣充分利用了现有的食物，这一情况得到了解决，这只满足的企鹅开始在他们周围游荡，好奇为什么他们要绕着圈子走。

PenPen also noticed that one particular person was missing from this picture, but this had happened before, and as such, it saw no cause for concern.  
PenPen 还注意到画面中少了一个人，但这种情况以前也发生过，因此它并不感到担忧。

Misato and Shinji ate in silence. Shinji noticed that Misato was drinking a bit more than usual. It reminded him of his first night in the apartment. For him, even to slurp noodles hurt enough to water his eyes, to speak would be even harder, so Shinji shut up and let her do what she did. After he was finished, Shinji cleared his own plates up. Misato was lazily picking at her food still when he got to his room. Without bothering to turn on the lights, he sat down on his bed. The phone rang then. It rang again. Seeing that Misato hadn't moved, Shinji got up and went to pick it up.  
美里和真嗣默默地吃着饭。真嗣注意到美里比平时喝得更多。这让他想起了自己刚搬进公寓的那个晚上。对他来说，就连吸面条都疼得足以让眼泪汪汪，说话更是难上加难，所以真嗣闭上了嘴，任由她做她的事。吃完后，真嗣收拾了自己的碗盘。美里还在懒洋洋地挑着食物，这时他回到了自己的房间。他没有费心开灯，就坐在了床上。电话铃响了。又响了一次。看到美里没有动，真嗣起身去接电话。

"He..." the sound strained his throat more than most others, "Hello."  
“他……”声音比其他大多数时候都更让他的喉咙感到不适，“喂。”

"_Shinji, is that you?"_ “真嗣，是你吗？”

Kaji.

"Yes." "是的。"

"_You sound terrible. Are you alright?"_  
"你听起来很糟糕。你还好吗？"

"It's nothing." "没什么。"

"_...it wasn't nothing, though, was it?"_  
"……但那并不是没什么，对吧？"

Shinji hung his head. 真嗣低下了头。

"_I know what happened. None of you noticed, but there are security cameras in those rooms, and we can request the footage. Just so you know."_  
“我知道发生了什么。你们都没注意到，但那些房间里有监控摄像头，我们可以申请查看录像。只是让你们知道。”

"Then you know." Shinji said.  
“那么你已经知道了。”真嗣说道。

"_I'm not sure what I know, to be honest. But, in any case, I do know for a fact that Misato's currently in a terrible mood. So, can you put her on?"_  
"老实说，我不确定我知道些什么。但无论如何，我确实知道美里现在心情很糟糕。所以，你能让她接电话吗？"

"Sure." "当然可以。"

"_Oh, and Shinji?"_ "哦，还有，真嗣？"

"Yes?" “是？”

"_It'll pass. Wounds heal and skin scars. It won't be as new, as before, but it'll be very, very close. And that small difference is a good thing sometimes."_  
"一切都会过去的。伤口会愈合，皮肤会留下疤痕。虽然不会像以前那样崭新，但会非常非常接近。而那一点小小的差异，有时候是件好事。"

Shinji passed the phone to Misato and disappeared into his room.  
真嗣把电话递给美里，然后消失在自己的房间里。

**5**

Morning came with the warm light reaching in through the open blinds and the sounds of Misato stumbling around in the kitchen to find a bite to eat. Shinji, still in his school uniform and lightly coughing from his sore throat, groggily wandered into the kitchen to find Misato, wrapped in a towel, foraging in the bags from yesternight for something suitable.  
清晨伴随着温暖的阳光透过敞开的百叶窗和美里在厨房里摸索找东西吃的声音到来。真嗣仍穿着校服，因喉咙痛而轻咳着，昏昏沉沉地走进厨房，发现美里裹着一条毛巾，在昨晚的袋子里翻找着合适的东西。

Shinji quietly returned to his room and changed. He had very few civilian outfits, as he was either at school or in a plugsuit most of the time. He pulled on his dark jeans and a blue, short-sleeve button-up shirt. Hoping Misato had gotten dressed, he went out and found her in her uniform, drying up her hair.  
真嗣悄悄回到自己的房间换了衣服。他几乎没有几件便服，因为他大部分时间要么在学校，要么穿着插入栓服。他穿上深色牛仔裤和一件蓝色短袖衬衫。希望美里已经穿好衣服，他走出去，发现她穿着制服，正在吹干头发。

"Good morning." He croaked.  
"早上好。" 他沙哑地说道。

"Good morning, Shinji." She said, "We don't have much in the way of breakfast. Want to go to someplace near? I'll drop you off at school afterwards."  
"早上好，真嗣。" 她说，"我们早餐没什么吃的了。想去附近的地方吗？之后我会送你去学校的。"

"It's a Saturday." "今天是星期六。"

"Oh. Well, NERV doesn't really do weekends, so I hadn't noticed... I'll drop you off at Toji's, or take you back here?"  
"哦。嗯，NERV 其实不分周末工作日，所以我没注意到... 我送你去东治那儿，还是带你回这里？"

"I'll come with you." He said, "But we have to stop by the... class rep's house first. If I know her, she'll have written... I promised to deliver."  
"我跟你一起去。" 他说，"但我们得先去... 班长的家。如果我了解她，她会写好... 我答应要送的东西。"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"I want to. And Rei..."  
"我想去。还有，绫波..."

"She's still in. They kept her overnight."  
"她还在里面。他们让她留院观察了一晚。"

"I'm glad she's okay." "我很高兴她没事。"

For a moment, Misato looked sadder than Shinji had ever seen her. It vanished as quickly as it had appeared.  
有那么一瞬，美里看起来比真嗣见过的任何时候都要悲伤。但那情绪转瞬即逝。

"Alright." She said, "So, what're you in the mood for?"  
“好的。”她说，“那么，你现在想做点什么呢？”

**6**

_Lastly, she pictured herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown-up woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream...  
最后，她想象着自己这个小妹妹将来会变成一个成熟的女性；她会如何保持童年的纯真和爱心，度过她成熟的岁月：她会如何围绕着其他小孩子，用许多奇妙的故事让他们的眼睛闪烁着渴望的光芒，也许甚至会分享那个梦想……_

"Hi."

Rei lowered the book and saw Shinji standing in the doorway. She closed the book and set it aside. It was difficult to gauge exactly how far he was, as bandages covered one eye. There was also a set of bandages over her left hand where her ring finger had been broken at the second knuckle. Shinji couldn't help but cringe. In his mind, he was also on the umbilical bridge, listening to Misato tell him that she would pilot Unit 01 if he wouldn't. He had, wanting to spare her, and he wondered if he could have spared her this.  
丽放下书，看到真嗣站在门口。她合上书，放在一旁。由于绷带遮住了一只眼睛，很难准确判断他站得有多远。她的左手上也缠着绷带，那里的小指在第二关节处骨折了。真嗣不禁皱眉。在他心里，他也站在脐带桥上，听着美里告诉他，如果他不愿意，她会驾驶初号机。他曾想保护她，而现在，他不知道自己是否也能保护她免受这一切。

"How are you feeling?" he asked.  
"你感觉怎么样？" 他问道。

"Alright." "好吧。"

"Does it... hurt?" "它... 疼吗？"

"I have two fractured ribs."  
"我有两根肋骨骨折了。"

"Oh." He averted his gaze, "I'm sorry."  
"哦。" 他移开了视线，"对不起。"

Rei was a bit taken aback.  
丽有些惊讶。

"What for?" she asked. "为什么？" 她问道。

"I couldn't keep her from..."  
"我无法阻止她……"

"You don't control her actions."  
"你无法控制她的行为。"

"I don't think she was, either... in control."  
"我也不认为她当时……能控制自己。"

"Be that as it may."  
"尽管如此。"

Silence, awkward for him, hung in the air.  
沉默，对他来说颇为尴尬，弥漫在空气中。

"I brought you something." He said, "I didn't have... well, you know. I didn't want to come empty-handed."  
"我给你带了点东西。" 他说，"我没有...呃，你知道的。我不想空手而来。"

He brought it to where she could see. It was an origami crane, folded very neatly, albeit from what seemed to have been an advertising menu from a noodle parlor. Rei took it by the wing and observed it. It was strange to her, different and yet unexplained.  
他把它拿到她能看到的地方。这是一只折得很整齐的纸鹤，尽管看起来是用一家面馆的广告菜单折成的。丽接过纸鹤的翅膀，仔细观察。这让她感到奇怪，既不同寻常又难以解释。

"I..." Rei fumbled for words, "Thank you."  
"我..." 丽结巴着找词，"谢谢你。"

"It's just a crane." Shinji said, managing a rather meek smile, "For your troubles."  
"只是一只纸鹤。" 真嗣说着，勉强挤出一个略显羞涩的微笑，"为了你的烦恼。"

Rei couldn't help but smile back.  
丽忍不住回以微笑。

**7**

The door was white and thick, seemingly made of some sort of composite metal. It was decorated with an ID and print scanner on the left side, and had bulletproof glass on its observation window. He had secured an all-access badge from Misato, whom had given it to him with the assertion that one more breach of protocol wouldn't hurt her.  
门是白色且厚重的，似乎是由某种复合金属制成。左侧装饰有身份识别和指纹扫描器，观察窗则是防弹玻璃。他从美里那里获得了一张全通行的徽章，她交给他时断言，再多一次违反规定也不会对她造成伤害。

Standing in front of the door, badge in one hand, a letter contained in a sky-blue envelope on the other, Shinji felt as if his muscles had seized up. He couldn't move. His instinct was to turn and run away.  
站在门前，一手拿着徽章，另一手握着装在天蓝色信封里的信，真嗣感觉自己的肌肉仿佛僵住了。他动弹不得。本能驱使他转身逃跑。

_I mustn't. Not this time. This is real. It really happened.  
我不能。这次不行。这是真的。它真的发生了。_

Flash-frame of her face as she was on top of him, strangling him... a snapshot of clarity.  
她压在他身上，掐着他时的脸庞一闪而过……一个清晰的瞬间。

Shinji slid the ID card. The lock clanked and the door hissed open.  
真嗣滑过身份证。锁咔嚓一声，门嘶嘶地打开了。

**8**

The bed was by the window. It had a bedside table next to it, with a Styrofoam cup of water and her sync clips next to that. She was there, her red hair scattered across the pillow; a stark contrast with the pure white surrounding her. She was wearing a hospital gown, visible only through the sheets drawn chest-high. They were largely undisturbed. Impeccable, even. There was an IV of clear liquid feeding into her hand, dripping ever-so-slowly.  
床靠窗摆放，旁边有一张床头柜，上面放着一杯水和她的同步夹。她躺在那里，红发散落在枕头上，与周围纯白的床单形成鲜明对比。她穿着医院的病号服，只能从胸前拉起的被单中隐约看到。被单几乎未被触动，整洁得近乎完美。一根透明的静脉注射管连接到她的手上，液体滴落得极其缓慢。

Shinji pulled up a chair, careful not to make too much noise – she was facing away from him, and he didn't want to wake her up if she was asleep. When he sat down, he saw that he didn't need to: her eyes were open. With an empty gaze, she was looking at the noon sky outside.  
真嗣轻轻拉过一把椅子，尽量不发出太大声响——她背对着他，他不想在她睡着时吵醒她。当他坐下时，他发现没有这个必要：她的眼睛是睁开的。她眼神空洞，凝视着窗外正午的天空。

_What do I say..? What do I want to say? Will she even hear me?  
我该说什么...我想说什么？她能听见我吗？_

_I think... I'll just pretend that she does.  
我想...我还是假装她听到了吧。_

"Hello." He said. There was no response, no indication that she had heard him. The greeting hung in the air.  
“你好。”他说。没有回应，没有任何她听到的迹象。这声问候就这样悬在空中。

"I wanted to see you." He said.  
“我想见你。”他说。

The ambient hum of the room.  
房间里弥漫的嗡嗡声。

"I brought you something. It's not from me. I'm sorry. I told Hikari. Not what really happened, a version of it. She wrote to you. I'm putting the letter on the bedside."  
“我给你带了点东西。不是我送的。对不起。我跟光说了。没说真正发生了什么，是其中一种版本。她写信给你。我把信放在床头。”

He placed it a little ways away from the cup, thinking that somehow, the cup would do the letter harm. Once that was done, he was free to hesitate. He wanted her to hear him, and at the same time, didn't.  
他将信放在离杯子稍远的地方，心想这样杯子就不会对信造成什么伤害。做完这些后，他便可以自由地犹豫了。他希望她能听到他的话，同时又不希望。

"What happened, I..." _come on, you coward, speak! Is this what you almost died for? Fucking silence?_ "I'm don't know why I deserved to die. I don't know why I'm alive, either. This bruise..." his fingers touched his neck, he shivered at the thin strip of pain, "...my life was in your hands. I won't ask you how that felt. I don't want to know that."  
"发生了什么，我..." 来吧，你这个懦夫，说出来！这就是你差点为之丧命的东西吗？该死的沉默？ "我不知道为什么我该死。我也不知道为什么我还活着。这个瘀伤..." 他的手指触碰到脖子，他因那细小的疼痛而颤抖，"...我的生命曾掌握在你手中。我不会问你那是什么感觉。我不想知道。"

No sign at all. 毫无迹象。

"There's so much that I don't understand. I don't know what to think anymore..."  
"有太多我不明白的事情。我不再知道该怎么想了..."

Shinji sighed. It felt like talking to a wall, where he wanted the wall to respond, to tell him something. Like sitting in a seesaw by himself and expecting his imaginary friend to move it, as he did as a child. Looking at her, he saw no sign of consciousness, despite her open eyes.  
真嗣叹了口气。感觉就像在对着一堵墙说话，他希望墙能回应，能告诉他些什么。就像小时候独自坐在跷跷板上，期待着想象中的朋友能推动它一样。看着她，尽管她的眼睛是睁开的，却看不到任何意识的迹象。

"I'll go for now." he said, getting up. He returned the chair to its place, and headed for the door. "I'll see you tomorrow."  
“我先走了。”他说着站起身来。他把椅子放回原位，朝门口走去。“明天见。”

### Chapter 14 Bye Bye Borderline

**Movement 13 第 13 乐章  
"Bye Bye Borderline" 再见，边缘人**

**1**

Misato was tied up with work, leaving Shinji to wander around GeoFront. He first asked at the reception what he was allowed to bring in with him, for both Rei and Asuka, and got a fairly thick checklist of things he _wasn't_ allowed to. With the list under his arm, he was left largely to his own devices. He decided to pay a visit to Dr. Akagi, to ask about what had happened.  
美里忙于工作，留下真嗣在 GeoFront 闲逛。他首先询问了前台可以带什么东西进来，给绫波和明日香，结果得到了一份相当详细的禁带物品清单。他把清单夹在腋下，基本上只能靠自己了。他决定去拜访赤木博士，询问发生了什么事。

Dr. Akagi, surprised that he'd come to her, told him while chain-smoking and typing with one hand, about Asuka's plummeting sync rate and what had happened while he was inside the Dirac Sea. She also assured him that Misato wouldn't be demoted – she might have been if they had went with Plan B, which she didn't tell him what it was. She also assured him in between cigarettes that Asuka's state was most likely temporary – a "fugue" she said, but neglected to explain what that was to him.  
赤木律子博士对碇真嗣来找她感到惊讶，一边抽烟一边用一只手打字，告诉他明日香同步率急剧下降的情况以及他在狄拉克海中时发生的事情。她还向他保证，美里不会被降职——如果他们选择了 B 计划，她可能就会被降职，但她没有告诉他 B 计划是什么。她还在抽烟间隙向他保证，明日香的状态很可能是暂时的——她称之为“解离状态”，但没有向他解释那是什么。

She then asked him, out of the blue, what he felt inside Unit 01. He found it difficult to express. The entry plug smelled of blood, but it was warm and oddly comforting at the same time. Reminded him, he confessed with some hesitation, of his mother. Dr. Akagi's response was unreadable for him.  
随后，她突然问他，在初号机里有什么感觉。他觉得难以表达。插入栓里弥漫着血腥味，但同时又温暖得令人安心。他有些犹豫地坦白，这让他想起了母亲。对于赤木博士的反应，他无法解读。

Misato found him a bit later in the waiting area, chugging carbonated drinks and chatting with Shigure on the subject of classical vs. modern music. She looked beyond worn out, there were dark circles under her eyes. She told him as they headed for the garage that Kaji would be joining them.  
不久后，美里在等候区找到了碇真嗣，他正在大口喝着碳酸饮料，与时雨谈论古典音乐与现代音乐的话题。她看起来疲惫不堪，眼圈发黑。她告诉他，他们前往车库时，加持会加入他们。

Kaji stayed over that night. Shinji opted to stay out of their way, even abstaining from cooking. He opted to play his cello instead, despite the late hour, and found himself progressing into improvised passages, using Misato's sobbing (and later, other, unsuccessfully hushed sounds) as a meter.  
那天晚上，加持留宿了。真嗣选择避开他们，甚至没有做饭。他选择拉大提琴，尽管时间已晚，却发现自己进入了即兴演奏的段落，以美里抽泣（后来是其他，未能成功压低的声音）作为节奏。

Come Sunday, Shinji first paid Hikari a visit, to give her the news. He assured her again that he'd let her know when non-NERV personnel could visit. Hikari passed a second, third and fourth letter to him, which he swore to protect with his life.  
到了周日，真嗣首先去拜访了光，告诉她这个消息。他再次向她保证，一旦非 NERV 人员可以探访，他会立即通知她。光递给他第二、第三和第四封信，他发誓会用生命保护它们。

Afterwards, he went to the park halfway down the hill, where he'd arranged for Toji and Kensuke to meet him. He began by telling them about the SDAT player, about the truth behind the "fight." Kensuke, with a sly smile, said that he knew while Toji insisted that it was legit. Shinji said he knew how to throw a punch now; a mistake, as it prompted Toji to ask for a demonstration. So he did, he slugged him one, with Kensuke filming it as if it was an actual fight, even providing rousing commentary.  
之后，他去了山腰半路上的公园，那里是他和东治、健介约定见面的地方。他首先告诉他们关于 SDAT 播放器的事，以及“战斗”背后的真相。健介带着狡黠的笑容说，他早就知道了，而东治则坚称那是真的。真嗣说他现在知道怎么出拳了；这是个错误，因为这促使东治要求他演示一下。于是他打了东治一拳，健介则像是在拍摄真正的战斗一样录制，甚至还提供了激昂的解说。

Shinji had Misato pick them up, and after dropping his friends off off, he went to visit Rei, this time in her apartment. She was reading the sequel to that book she was occupied with the last time (and what exactly was a "looking glass" anyway?), one she said was about a "semi-lucid dream sequence and nothing more."  
真嗣让美里来接他们，送走朋友们后，他去拜访了绫波，这次是在她的公寓。她正在读那本书的续集，上次她全神贯注的那本（话说回来，“镜子”到底是什么东西？），她说这本书讲的是一个“半清醒的梦境序列，仅此而已”。

He noticed that her underwear cabinet was serving as an altar for white, plastic bottles of various sizes – from pain medication to whatever she usually took.  
他注意到她的内衣柜被当作了祭坛，上面摆满了各种大小不一的白色塑料瓶——从止痛药到她平时吃的各种东西。

Rei gave the first book to him, told him that he might enjoy it. Shinji accepted her gift with a smile and returned to the car. His smile waned fairly quickly once Misato drove away and in the direction of the hospital.  
绫波把第一本书送给了他，告诉他可能会喜欢。真嗣微笑着接受了她的礼物，回到车上。当美里开车驶向医院的方向时，他的笑容很快就消失了。

**2**

Asuka was waiting silently. She was on her side this time, facing the window still, and for a moment, Shinji thought she might have moved on her own. He then recalled that coma patients were often shifted around, to prevent bed sores. He also noticed the IV had been removed. Hikari's first letter was on her bedside, it had been opened, and it seemed, read. Pressure points from fingertips were apparent, especially at one spot where the pencil marks had been slightly smudged.  
明日香静静地等待着。这次她侧躺着，依旧面向窗户，有那么一瞬间，真嗣以为她自己动了。随后他想起，昏迷的病人常会被移动，以防止褥疮。他还注意到点滴已被移除。第一封光写给她的信放在床头，信已被打开，似乎也读过了。指尖按压的痕迹明显，特别是在一处，铅笔标记略微模糊。

**3**

Monday saw his father return. He called for him, of course, and Misato.  
周一，他的父亲回来了。他当然叫了他，还有美里。

**4**

_Misato, standing at attention three feet behind him, was silent, almost mirroring Vice Commander Fuyutsuki with her presence. The room was vast and largely undecorated, save for his father's desk, but his mere presence filled up most of it. There, facing one another, father and son appeared to be in a staring contest, one that Gendo Ikari would break.  
美里站在他身后三英尺处，肃立无声，几乎与副司令官冬月镜像般的存在。房间宽敞且几乎未加装饰，除了他父亲的办公桌，但他的存在几乎填满了大部分空间。父子俩面对面，仿佛在进行一场瞪眼比赛，而这场较量，将由碇源堂打破。_

"_Do you have anything to say?"_  
"你有什么要说的吗？"

_Shinji found that he couldn't smile, though he would have. He had thought about this, having known that it was coming. He had made sure he had an answer.  
真嗣发现自己笑不出来，尽管他本想笑的。他早就考虑过这个问题，知道这是迟早的事。他确保自己已经准备好了答案。_

"_I did what I thought was right."_  
"我做了我认为正确的事。"

_Gendo Ikari's face was a mask, giving nothing away.  
碇源堂的脸如同一副面具，不露半点情绪。_

"_Why did you cut the umbilical cable?" he asked._  
“你为什么要切断脐带电缆？”他问道。

"_Asuka..." he thought better to use a more official designation, "Pilot Soryu is unlike me. She works better under pressure. But she's also stubborn. If she had unlimited time, she would have insisted on having her way. But if she had only five minutes, she would have to focus on what was important."_  
“明日香……”他觉得还是用更正式的称呼为好，“式波·明日香·兰格雷和我不同。她在压力下表现更佳。但她也很固执。如果有无限的时间，她会坚持自己的方式。但如果只有五分钟，她就必须专注于重要的事情。”

_Behind his teeth, Shinji had trapped another piece of truth, a piece of advice from Specialist Miyamoto: "it is generally a good idea to finish what you've started, and to use a full measure when doing so."  
在他的牙齿后面，真嗣藏起了另一片真相，那是来自宫本专家的忠告：“通常来说，完成你开始的事情，并且在做的时候要全力以赴，是个好主意。”_

_Gendo Ikari didn't flinch or move for a few moments. Then, as if contemplating still the statement, he just said:  
碇源堂没有退缩或移动片刻。然后，仿佛仍在思考那句话，他只是说：_

"_...I see."_ “……我明白了。”

**5**

They had walked out of that room without any further comment. Misato kept her rank. Shinji kept an impression that his father was keeping a tight lip, but this time, for something different than he was used to.  
他们一言不发地走出了那个房间。美里保留了她的职位。真嗣留下了一个印象，他的父亲紧闭双唇，但这次，与以往不同。

**6**

Throughout the rest of the week and into the next, Shinji's time was spent going to school, visiting Hikari and Rei, reporting for a sync test, and then visiting Asuka, as regular visiting hours did not apply to him.  
在接下来的整个星期乃至下一周，真嗣的时间都花在了上学、探望光和绫波、进行同步测试，然后探望明日香，因为常规的探访时间对他并不适用。

At school, the sudden absence of the glaringly obvious Asuka Langley Soryu, an unexplained bruise around his neck had forced Shinji's hand to spin a yarn, reciting what would be the official story, eventually. Hikari, Toji and Kensuke helped in making it believable, though Toji and Kensuke seemed to be on a confusion campaign, pitting contradictory versions of the story against one another in what they claimed was an attempt to pre-empt gossip by having all bases covered.  
在学校，明日香·兰格雷突然的缺席和脖子上明显的瘀伤迫使真嗣编造了一个故事，最终这成了官方说法。光、剑介和真希波帮忙让它听起来可信，尽管剑介和真希波似乎在搞混淆视听的策略，他们声称是为了提前阻止流言，通过提供相互矛盾的版本以覆盖所有可能性。

Shinji spent his afternoons on the roof with Rei, usually discussing the book she had lent him. They were now exchanging them, often based on Rei's bizarre requests. The news of a Unit 03 being prepared to be brought over was also a prominent point of discussion, whereby Rei had confirmed his suspicions that he himself was called "Third Children" because he represented the chosen pilot from an available talent pool, wherever that may be. The Fourth Children would be another one of the chosen.  
真嗣常在屋顶与绫波度过下午时光，通常是讨论她借给他的书。他们现在互相交换书籍，往往基于绫波那些奇特的要求。关于准备引进的零三号机的新闻也是他们讨论的重点，绫波证实了他的猜想，他被称为“第三适格者”是因为他代表从可用人才库中选出的驾驶员，无论这个人才库在哪里。第四适格者将是另一个被选中的人。

His sync rate fell during his recovery, but never below 100%. After a few fluctuations, it found a comfortable place between 120% and 150%, and seemed to be stable. Dr. Akagi gave him a fair amount of reading material to help him understand what that meant, and Shinji still wasn't sure. But it comforted him that it wouldn't keep going up, and he didn't question it.  
他在康复期间同步率有所下降，但从未低于 100%。经过几次波动后，它稳定在 120%到 150%之间，似乎趋于平稳。赤木博士给了他相当多的阅读材料来帮助他理解这意味着什么，而真嗣仍然不太确定。但这让他感到安慰，因为它不会再继续上升，他也没有对此提出质疑。

Kaji stayed over most nights, bringing a welcome change. As Misato was still swamped, he was the one who took him home from the hospital most nights, and had accompanied Shinji to her room a few times. Shinji wondered in those moments, albeit briefly, if he would have been a different person had his father been more like Kaji.  
加持大多数晚上都会留宿，带来了受欢迎的变化。由于美里依然忙得不可开交，他多数晚上负责从医院接真嗣回家，并几次陪同真嗣到她的房间。在这些时刻，尽管短暂，真嗣不禁想，如果他的父亲更像加持，他会不会成为一个不同的人。

**7**

_The quiet night road rolled on by, Kaji steering rather casually with one hand. Shinji was watching the scenery he had practically memorized. He spoke first.  
宁静的夜路缓缓展开，加持单手随意地驾驶着。真嗣注视着这片他几乎熟记于心的风景。他先开了口。_

"_She walked today."_ “她今天走路了。”

"_Hm?"_

"_She got up and walked to the water machine." Shinji said, "She shuffled her feet... she looked like she was asleep."_  
“她起身走向饮水机。”真嗣说道，“她拖着脚步……看起来像是在梦游。”

"_That's different." He said, "She's been moving though, hasn't she? She sat up the last time I was there. Nodded once, too."_  
"那不一样。" 他说，"她一直在动，不是吗？上次我在那儿时，她坐起来了。还点了一下头。"

"_What were you saying?"_ "你刚才说什么？"

"_I don't remember. Did you speak to the doctors?"_  
"我不记得了。你跟医生谈过了吗？"

"_They say she's responsive. They thought it was strange she wasn't speaking."_  
"他们说她有反应。他们觉得奇怪她怎么不说话。"

"_But that's good, isn't it?" Kaji asked as he took a turn, "She's not in a coma. She's not catatonic. It means she can hear and understand. Anyway, you should ask Misato about that."_  
"但这不是好事吗？" 加持问道，同时转动方向盘，"她没有昏迷，也不是紧张症。这意味着她能听见并理解。无论如何，你应该问问美里。"

"_Misato? Why?"_ "美里？为什么？"

"_Oh. Right, you don't know. Well..." he smiled, "Don't tell her that I told you. She'll have my balls for it."_  
"哦，对了，你不知道。嗯..." 他笑了笑，"别告诉她是我告诉你的。不然她会要了我的命。""

"_I swear."_ "我发誓。""

"_Misato was there during the Second Impact. She was saved, found in a protective capsule. After she was recovered, she didn't talk for two years."_  
"第二次冲击时，美里在场。她被救了出来，发现时在一个保护舱里。获救后，她有两年时间没有说话。""

"_At all?"_ "完全不？"

"_At all." Kaji said with a nod, "I've only read some official documentation, but you know what went down there, more or less. I don't claim to know exactly why she was silent for so long, but when it comes down to it, what she has seen must have taken that long to digest. See, it's when your thoughts can't absorb something properly that you get speechless. I know you and Asuka have your differences, but I don't know her as the murderous type... so, I guess, there must be something she's digesting as well."_  
"完全不。" 加持点头说道，"我只读过一些官方文件，但你知道那里发生了什么，或多或少。我不敢说我确切知道她为什么沉默了这么久，但归根结底，她所见的一切必定需要这么长时间来消化。你看，当你的思维无法正确吸收某些东西时，你就会变得无言以对。我知道你和明日香有分歧，但我并不认为她是那种凶残的人……所以，我想，她一定也在消化某些事情。"

**8**

Shinji never got a response out of her. He still went every day, and began to take her home-cooked meals after the third day, navigating the contents by the checklist he had been given. He didn't know if she was eating any of them, as she didn't do so while he was there. He knew that she was reading Hikari's letters, as he always found the sealed envelopes opened and the pages marked with pressure points.  
真嗣从未得到她的回应。他仍然每天都去，从第三天开始，他开始带去她亲手做的饭菜，按照他得到的清单来选择内容。他不知道她是否吃了这些食物，因为她在他面前从未吃过。他知道她在读光寄来的信，因为他总是发现密封的信封被打开，信纸上留下了按压的痕迹。

He also knew that he wasn't writing back, and hadn't called.  
他也清楚自己没有回信，也没有打电话。

Most of his days comprised of talking to her, pretending that she was listening. He told her of what had happened to him, if something had happened at NERV. A few times, he imagined responses, but the Asuka in his head was strangely close to her external counterpart: unresponsive.  
他大部分时间都在和她说话，假装她在听。他告诉她自己发生了什么，如果 NERV 有什么事的话。有几次，他想象着她的回应，但脑海中的明日香却出奇地接近现实中的她：毫无反应。

It was just a regular day when, on a whim, he decided that maybe he could play cello for her. He told her that, and found himself wishing he hadn't. The cello was one of the things in his life that he didn't know where he stood in relation to. He was playing it for Misato and Kaji, and often _because_ of them, but otherwise, he wasn't entirely sure. But it was something different, and if she didn't want to hear him speak, they could shut the fuck up and listen to the silence.  
那只是一个平常的日子，他一时兴起，决定或许可以为她拉大提琴。他告诉了她这个想法，随即又后悔了。大提琴是他生活中不太确定自己立场的东西之一。他曾为美里和加持拉过，也常因他们而拉，但除此之外，他并不完全确定。不过，这是件不同寻常的事，如果她不想听他说话，他们可以闭嘴，静静聆听沉默。

But he let the suggestion lie where it fell. He was almost out of the door when she asked him why.  
但他任由这个建议停留在原地。就在他几乎要走出门口时，她问他为什么。

**9**

"...why do you keep coming back?"  
“……你为什么总是回来？”

"I..." he felt confusion wash over him, "To see you. I mean, why else would I-"  
“我……”他感到困惑涌上心头，“为了见你。我是说，不然我还会为什么……”

"Just give up." "放弃吧。"

Shinji's eyes widened. 真嗣的眼睛睁大了。

"_What..?"_ "什么..?"

"I thought you'd give up on your own if I didn't do anything, but you're too dense to see that, it seems."  
"我以为如果你自己不放弃，我什么都不做你就会明白，但看来你太迟钝了，看不清这一点。"

Shinji was speechless. Something was stirring in his chest.  
真嗣无言以对。他的胸中有什么在涌动。

"You keep coming around here like a little puppy dog trying to figure out what he did wrong. You haven't changed a bit. Still trying to say you're sorry. I hate it."  
你就像只小狗一样，一次次跑来这里，试图弄清楚自己哪里做错了。你一点都没变，还是在试图说对不起。我讨厌这样。

Shinji's mouth was open, but no words would come out.  
真嗣的嘴张开着，却说不出一句话来。

"I don't want your damn pity." Asuka snarled through clenched teeth, "I don't want your charity, either." She fingered the plastic bag holding the food he'd brought, "And I sure as hell don't want your sympathy."  
"我不想你的该死怜悯。" 明日香咬牙切齿地咆哮，"我也不需要你的施舍。" 她摩挲着装有他带来的食物的塑料袋，"我绝对不要你的同情。"

Shinji hissed through clenched teeth. He felt feverish with anger in that instant. All this time, everything that had happened... it was too much.  
真嗣咬紧牙关，倒吸一口气。那一刻，他感到愤怒得像发烧一样。这一切，所有发生的事... 太多了。

"I tried to kill you." She said. Her hands curled into fists on her lap, "Anyone with half a brain would stay the hell away from me. Not bring me pity gifts and stupid letters well-wishing for an injury that didn't even happen, not bring Kaji-san along for the show. Mein Gott, I-"  
"我曾试图杀了你。" 她说。她的手在膝上握成拳，"任何一个有半点脑子的人都会离我远远的。不会给我带来怜悯的礼物和愚蠢的慰问信，不会为了表演而带上加持先生。我的天，我-"

"_Shut the fuck up."_ "闭嘴。"

Asuka peered through the corner of her eye and saw that he was trembling.  
明日香斜眼瞥去，看到他在颤抖。

"I'm such an idiot." He said, "You're right, I am. I just never realized it until now."  
"我真是个白痴。" 他说，"你说得对，我就是。我直到现在才意识到这一点。"

Asuka didn't react, though her curiosity had piqued.  
明日香没有反应，尽管她的好奇心已经被勾起。

"Because I just don't get it, see... if you can't stand me, why didn't you finish the job and kill me?"  
“因为我就是不明白，你看……如果你受不了我，为什么不干脆把我杀了？”

Asuka's eyes flew open, her body jerked, almost as if to make a sudden move towards him.  
明日香的双眼猛地睁开，身体一震，几乎像是要突然向他扑去。

**9**

_Hands around his throat, his fleshy Adam's apple caving easily as she pressed down. His fingers were holding hers, it almost looked like the poor idiot was trying to calm her down. Hah!  
双手环绕在他的脖子上，她一用力，他那肉乎乎的喉结便轻易地凹陷下去。他的手指紧握着她的，看上去这可怜的傻瓜似乎在试图安抚她。哈哈！_

"_Asu... ka..."_ “麻...衣...”

Don't say my name, don't you dare say my name!  
别叫我的名字，你敢叫我的名字试试！

You're killing him, Asuka-chan! You're killing him!  
你在杀他，明日香！你在杀他！

Killing who!? He's a cruel joke, nothing more! He doesn't even exist!  
杀谁！？他只是个残酷的笑话，仅此而已！他甚至不存在！

_She heard her own voice, screaming ire.  
她听到自己的声音，愤怒地尖叫着。_

"_You, you, you, why!? Why is it you!?"_  
"你，你，你，为什么！？为什么是你！？"

And why is it? Shinji the Unstoppable, Shinji the Fearless, Shinji the Favored – the little wuss who always gets a free pass! Sync rate Infinite, like it means anything! _"I don't need anyone! Do you hear me, Shinji Ikari!? I don't need anyone else!"_ All I need is myself! I can take care of myself! I can fight my own battles! I can live on my own! _"I don't need you!"_ I don't need you at all!  
而为什么是他？无敌的真嗣，无畏的真嗣，备受宠爱的真嗣——那个总是被放过的胆小鬼！同步率无限，就像有什么意义似的！“我不需要任何人！你听到了吗，碇真嗣！？我不需要任何人！”我只需要我自己！我可以照顾自己！我可以自己战斗！我可以独自生活！“我不需要你！”我根本不需要你！

_Shinji's eyes, barely open, looked at her own. She saw something, if only for an instant, break behind them. Saw what looked like sorrow surface. That was when Shinji's right hand rose and brushed, softly, against her cheek. He cupped his hand over it, and his fingertips feebly caressed her hair.  
真嗣半睁的眼睛看着她，她看到他的眼神中似乎有什么东西在那一瞬间破碎了。看到了似乎是悲伤的情绪浮现。就在这时，真嗣的右手抬起，轻轻地拂过她的脸颊。他用手掌覆盖住她的脸颊，手指无力地抚摸着她的头发。_

What are you doing!? 你在干什么！？

_His hand began to tremble, his arm was trying to hold on. His thumb gently slid on her cheek, as if to reassure. As if to comfort.  
他的手开始颤抖，手臂试图坚持。他的拇指轻轻滑过她的脸颊，仿佛在安慰。仿佛在抚慰。_

I'm killing you. I'm killing you right now. Your life is in my hands. I'm killing you and all you can do is tell me that it's okay? That it's okay to die? It's never okay! I...  
我在杀你。我现在就在杀你。你的生命掌握在我手中。我在杀你，而你只能告诉我这没关系？死掉也没关系？从来都不行！我……

_His hand dropped. It made a faint sound – to her, it was as deafening as a gunshot. He was still for a moment, and in that instant, she saw herself on the bed, with her own hands around her throat.  
他的手垂了下来。那声音很轻微——对她来说，却如同枪声般震耳欲聋。他静止了一瞬，就在那一刻，她看见自己躺在床上，双手扼在自己的喉咙上。_

I don't want to die! Why!? Why would you want to!? Why would anyone want to!? I don't want to die, I'm scared of dying, I don't want to be a corpse!  
我不想死！为什么？！你为什么要这样？！为什么有人会想死？！我不想死，我害怕死亡，我不想变成一具尸体！

_Her hands slackened. They were trembling.  
她的手松开了。它们在颤抖。_

Do you... 你...

_She held her head. Something was expanding in there, it wouldn't fit, her skull was too small, her head was too small for it to fit, it wouldn't fit...  
她抱着头。有什么东西在里面膨胀，无法容纳，她的头骨太小，脑袋太小，容纳不下，它无法适应..._

I don't want you to die!  
我不想你死！

_Something broke. Asuka screamed and recoiled. She fell...  
有什么东西碎了。明日香尖叫着后退，摔倒了..._

**10**

"Fine." He said, "Have it your way."  
“好吧。”他说，“随你的便。”

He turned to leave. 他转身离开。

"Oh, typical. You're running away again. See ya tomorrow."  
"哦，老样子。你又在逃避了。明天见。"

Shinji shrugged. 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"I'm not running away from you." Shinji said with a chuckle, feeling the pain, less than it used to be, travel across his throat, "I'm done. I'm not coming back tomorrow."  
"我不是在逃避你。" 真嗣笑着说，感觉到喉咙上的疼痛，虽然比以前轻了些，"我受够了。我明天不会回来了。"

Asuka sneered. _As if. You-_  
明日香嗤之以鼻。得了吧。你——

"Just so you know... I kept coming back here, because I want to know if you're alright. I'm bringing you food, because I've stayed here myself, and I know how dull hospital food can be. I said I'd play, because you don't want to talk, so maybe we should just shut the _fuck_ up, then."  
“只是让你知道...我不断回到这里，是因为我想知道你是否安好。我给你带食物，是因为我自己也在这里待过，我知道医院的伙食有多单调。我说我会玩，是因为你不想说话，所以也许我们应该干脆闭嘴。”

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"But it's impossible." He said, "In any case... I'll talk to Misato when I get back, see which one of us is easier to move out. I don't know when they'll let you leave, but I'll try to sort it out before you get back."  
"但这是不可能的。" 他说，"无论如何... 我回去后会和美里谈谈，看看我们俩谁更容易搬出去。我不知道他们什么时候会让你离开，但我会尽力在你回来之前解决这个问题。"

"Y-you're not-" "你-你不是-"

"Oh, and write back to Hikari for once. Or at least call. You've read the letters. She's worried sick about you, and she doesn't deserve this."  
"哦，还有，这次给光回封信吧。或者至少打个电话。你已经读过她的信了。她为你担心得要命，她不该受这种罪。"

"Shinji-" "真嗣——"

"Goodbye, Asuka." "再见，明日香。"

He was out the door before she could say anything else.  
在她能再说些什么之前，他已经走出了门。

_Looks like it's bye bye, borderline, Asuka-chan.  
看来是再见啦，边缘人，明日香酱。_

### Chapter 15 German

**Movement 14 第十四运动  
"Germany" 德意志**

**1**

Asuka waited patiently, one eye on the clock, knowing his small-margin punctuality and certain that he'd be there, apologizing for whatever he had said, without a clear idea as to what exactly he had said. But this time, he didn't come. The hour passed, and he was not there. Asuka shrugged it off at first – it was a fit. It wouldn't last long. She refused to complain to herself about the food in the evening. She refused to acknowledge that it was pretty bland and tasteless in comparison. She went to sleep, having surveyed her own chart and found out that she'd be held there until Sunday afternoon, pending a series of tests. Four days.  
明日香耐心地等待着，目光不时瞥向时钟，深知他总是分秒不差地准时出现，相信他会来，并为之前可能失言的话道歉，尽管他自己也记不清究竟说了什么。然而这一次，他并未如约而至。时间一分一秒过去，他始终没有出现。起初，明日香并未放在心上——她以为这只是他一时的情绪波动，不会持续太久。她拒绝向自己抱怨晚餐的食物，不愿承认与往常相比，这顿饭确实显得平淡无味。夜深了，她查看完自己的日程安排后，得知自己将在此停留至周日下午，等待一系列的检查。这意味着她还要在这里度过四天的时间。

Shinji didn't come the next day either, but this time, at the hour of his regular visit, Kaji, wearing his charming smile and with his tie completely untied, walked in with his hands in his pockets.  
第二天新治依然没有出现，然而到了他通常来访的时刻，阿治带着迷人的微笑，领带松散，双手插兜地走了进来。

"Kaji-san!" Asuka said. "加治先生！" 明日香喊道。

"Hello, Asuka. Glad to see you're doing a lot better."  
你好，明日香。很高兴看到你恢复得不错。

"If it wasn't for all those tests they have me do, I'd be out sooner. Most of them are pretty see-through, anyway."  
要不是他们让我做那么多测试，我早就离开了。其实这些测试大多都挺直白的。

Kaji pulled up a chair and sat down. He rested his chin against the back.  
卡吉搬来一把椅子坐下，下巴轻轻抵在椅背上。

"I'm glad it's just you." She said, "We can be alone."  
我很高兴只有你。" 她说，"这样我们就能单独相处了。

"Not sure if that's the best thing."  
不太确定那是不是最佳选择。

"Oh, come on! Didn't you miss me?"  
“哎呀，别这样！你难道不想我吗？”

"Now that's unfair." Kaji said with a smile.  
"现在这样可不公平。" 卡吉笑着说道。

"You're no fun." 你一点儿也不好玩。

Kaji's face darkened all of a sudden. Asuka felt something in the air, something she had never felt with him before. Light, very light tension.  
加治的脸色骤然变得阴沉，明日香察觉到空气中弥漫着一种前所未有的微妙紧张感。

"Asuka, I have to know... what did you say to him?"  
明日香，我得弄清楚...你到底跟他说了些什么？

"Who?" 是谁？

"Shinji." 真嗣。

Asuka forced a shrug. 明日香勉强耸了耸肩。

"I don't want to spend our time talking about him."  
我不想浪费我们的时间来讨论他。

"Tough luck." He said, "He says he wants to move out. Misato had me looking for alternatives, since she didn't have the time."  
运气真不好。" 他解释道，"他说他想搬出去住。美里让我帮忙找找其他方案，因为她实在抽不出时间。

"It's all talk. You know what he's like."  
都是些空话。你了解他的为人。

"He's serious. He says he wants to be out by Sunday. Now, I didn't yet ask them, but that wouldn't happen to be when you're coming back, now, would it?"  
他态度很认真，表示希望在周日之前离开。我还没来得及问他们，但那不会正好是你回来的时间吧，对吗？

Asuka stumbled. He caught it, knowing the tells, but outwardly, she only appeared to be mildly annoyed.  
明日香踉跄了一下。他察觉到了，知道那些细微的迹象，但表面上，她只是略显不悦。

"So what if it is? What do I care what he wants to do?"  
那又如何？我何必在意他想做什么呢？

"You are so stubborn, you know that?" he said, chuckling, "Shinji's got his issues. He has more weight on his shoulders than most his age."  
你真是固执，知道吗？" 他笑着说，"真嗣有自己的问题。他肩上的担子比同龄人重得多。

"So do I! You don't hear me moaning about it, 'cause I know how to handle it."  
我也是！你没听到我在抱怨，因为我懂得怎么处理。

Kaji raised an eyebrow, and that told her everything his mouth was not saying: _not so sure that you do as much as you say you do._  
卡吉扬起眉毛，这一细微动作已传达了他未出口的疑虑：你所说的和你所做的，恐怕并不相符。

"He's still learning. He wasn't born into this, like you. He just woke up one day and there it was. NERV, EVA, his father, all of it. He was a flawed kid, but a good kid, a nice kid. A fragile kid."  
他仍在学习过程中。不像你，他并非天生就了解这一切。他只是某天醒来，突然间，NERV、EVA、他的父亲，所有这些都出现在他的生活中。他虽然有缺点，但本质上是个好孩子，心地善良。只是，他也很脆弱。

Asuka tried not to flinch.  
明日香努力克制自己不要退缩。

"And now he's walking around with bruises on his neck, still can't talk above a murmur, and he says he wants to leave the only thing close to a home he's known. He hasn't said a single bad thing about you, did you know that? He didn't even say why he wanted to move out. I worked that part out myself."  
如今他脖子上带着瘀伤四处走动，说话声音依旧低沉，他表示想离开这个他唯一感到像家的地方。他对你没有任何怨言，这一点你知道吗？他甚至没有说明为何想要搬走，这部分是我自己揣摩出来的。

Asuka hung her head. Kaji had seen this response only once before, and knew that he was on the right track.  
明日香垂下了头。凯吉之前只见过一次这样的反应，他确信自己走对了方向。

"He stuck by you after you... well. Whatever you did, or said, it was very cruel, Asuka. I don't know exactly what it was, since it's not my business to know, but I just want you to understand that you've hurt him terribly. And I just think, which is just me, by the way, he deserves a little better than that."  
在你...嗯，无论你做了什么或说了什么，那都非常残忍，明日香。我不清楚具体是什么，毕竟这不是我该知道的，但我希望你能明白，你深深地伤害了他。而且，我只是个人看法，他值得比这更好的对待。

Kaji stood up and returned the chair. He came around and ruffled up Asuka's hair.  
卡吉起身归还椅子，随后走到明日香身边，揉乱了她的头发。

"So hang in there, yeah?"  
所以，坚持下去，好吗？

**2**

Asuka left her room shortly after Kaji to go to the reception. For the first time since she had been put in that room, she called Hikari.  
明日香在加治离开后不久也离开了房间，前往接待处。这是她入住那个房间以来第一次联系光。

**3**

The remaining days passed by relatively quickly, owing much to the fact that she was allowed to read newspapers, at long last. There was nothing terribly interesting, of course, but she entertained herself by playing an impromptu cipher game, where she picked out individual words to string in a sentence, the goal being to make them as ominous as possible. This kept her occupied for a short period of time, and then there were more rounds of tests. Between neurographs and Rorschach blots and filling out forms full of stupid, neutral statements that could go any which way, Asuka always found herself back in her room.  
余下的日子过得颇为迅速，这多亏了她终于获准阅读报纸。虽然内容并不特别引人入胜，但她通过玩一种即兴的文字游戏来打发时间，她挑选单个词汇串联成句，力求使其显得尽可能不祥。这让她短暂地忙碌起来，随后又是一轮轮的测试。在神经图谱、罗夏墨迹测试以及填写那些毫无意义、模棱两可的表格之间，明日香总是发现自己回到了自己的房间。

She called Hikari every day, providing adequately detailed lies about her "injuries" (Shinji hadn't specified it, he had just said there was a danger period after she had come down from a critical point) so as to make sure she didn't know much, but knew enough. While it hadn't been said, Asuka guessed that NERV would want to keep the incident to themselves.  
她每日致电光，编织详尽的谎言描述自己的“伤情”（真嗣未曾详述，仅提及她脱离险境后存在一段危险期），旨在让她知之甚少却又不至于一无所知。尽管未曾言明，明日香揣测 NERV 倾向于将此事件低调处理。

Shinji didn't come back again. Asuka waited, her patience growing thin until, on Saturday, she realized that he would not be coming back. She hid how she felt about it from the prying psychologists, and hid it well... well enough to hide it from herself.  
真嗣再也没有回来。明日香耐心等待，但随着时间的推移，她的耐心逐渐耗尽。到了周六，她终于明白他不会再回来了。她巧妙地向那些好奇的心理学家隐瞒了自己的真实感受，甚至成功地欺骗了自己。

When she closed her eyes to sleep that night, she saw the SDAT player... and how desperately he was begging her to not harm it.  
那晚，她闭眼欲眠，脑海中浮现出 SDAT 播放器的影像，以及他如何竭力哀求她不要对其造成伤害。

"Are you coming in?" 你准备进来吗？

Misato was waiting, her bare foot tapping on the floor, her thumbs hooked into her jeans' pockets. Asuka hesitated, without a clue as to why she was. She looked down. The threshold was marked, like the border of a different nation, so simple that it was almost invisible, but at the same time, too present to be ignored. She stepped over the line. Misato waited for a few seconds, and then headed inside. Asuka took off her shoes, placed them where they belonged. She took a breath, careful to make it look natural in case Misato was watching, and stepped in.  
美里站在那里等待，赤裸的脚轻轻敲打着地面，拇指钩在牛仔裤的口袋里。明日香犹豫了，她并不清楚自己为何如此。她低头看向门槛，那标记简单到几乎难以察觉，却又明显得让人无法忽视，仿佛是两个不同世界的分界线。她鼓起勇气跨过了那条线。美里稍等片刻，随即步入屋内。明日香脱下鞋子，摆放妥当。她深吸一口气，尽量表现得自然，以防美里在留意，随后也踏入了房间。

The house was the same. She found that she was expecting a mess, maybe a parade of empty Yebisu cans, clothes thrown everywhere... but it wasn't like that. One look at the place, and she wished that it was.  
房子依旧如故。她本以为会看到一片混乱，可能满地都是喝空的惠比寿啤酒罐，衣服乱丢一气……然而并非如此。她只看了一眼，就希望现实真是那样糟糕。

As tidy as it ever had been, the house was clean and orderly. Nothing at all had changed.  
房子依旧整洁如新，干净而有序。一切如故，未有丝毫变化。

_It's like nothing happened. It's like I never was absent.  
一切如常，仿佛我从未离开。_

Asuka felt a displacement then, as if her own thought had transformed the apartment into that truth in a split second. She didn't feel like she had been gone at all. It was familiar, every corner, every piece of furniture, every irregularity and imperfection. In some way, she was happy to be back, in the same way she often was relieved to be home after a grueling post-battle debriefing.  
那一刻，明日香感受到了一种时空的错位，仿佛自己的思绪在刹那间将公寓变成了那个真相。她并未感到自己离开过。一切都那么熟悉，每个角落，每件家具，每一处不规则和瑕疵。在某种程度上，她很高兴能回到这里，就像她经常在艰苦的战后汇报后感到回家的解脱一样。

Asuka thought of the threshold, of the moment she had stepped over it.  
明日香回想起那个门槛，以及她迈过它的瞬间。

_This is Germany now. 这是当下的德国。_

The apartment felt free and open, a breath of fresh air. But part of her knew that this was because she and Misato were the only ones there at that moment. That part knew: he'd be back. He lived there, too. The conquered territory would become the warzone again.  
公寓里自由而开阔，宛如一股清新的空气。然而她内心深处明白，这不过是因为她和美里是当时仅有的居住者。她深知：他还会回来。毕竟，他也住在这里。这片曾被征服的土地，终将再次化作战场。

"We cleaned your room yesterday, "Misato said, "Only surfaces. Fresh sheets. We didn't touch anything, in case you were wondering."  
昨天我们帮你打扫了房间，"美里解释道，"只是简单清理了表面，换了干净的床单。我们没碰其他东西，免得你担心。

_We? You mean, he helped you do it?  
我们吗？你的意思是，他帮你完成了这件事？_

"And before anything else, let's get the obvious out of the way. This is your home. But it's his home, too. He's not going anywhere."  
首先，让我们直截了当地说清楚。这是你的家，但同样也是他的家。他不会离开的。

Asuka saw conviction in her eyes and a bit of anger in her voice.  
明日香从她的眼神中察觉到了坚定，而她的声音里也隐含着些许怒意。

"I know now that it's not a good fit." Misato said with a sigh, "But we'll make it work. Besides which, NERV refuses to relocate either one of you, so it's out of our hands too. It is what we have, and we'll make the best of it."  
我现在明白这并不合适。" 美里叹息道，"不过我们会想办法解决。况且，NERV 也不愿意调动你们任何一方，所以我们也无能为力。既然现状如此，我们就尽力而为吧。

"Thank you." 感谢您。

"Don't thank me." Misato said, "Not yet, at least. I'm not ready for it."  
别急着谢我。" 美里说，"至少现在还不行。我还没准备好接受感谢。

Asuka peered at Shinji's door. It was closed, a sight she had gotten used to prior to the Angel, but Misato caught it.  
明日香注视着真嗣的房门，门紧闭着，这在天使出现前她已习以为常，然而美里却察觉到了。

"Looking for Shinji?" 在找真嗣吗？

"N-not especially." Asuka said, reeling in her curiosity.  
"不，并没有特别感兴趣。" 明日香说道，控制住了自己的好奇心。

"He said he'd be at the park." Misato said, "You know the one?"  
他说他会在公园。Misato 问：“你知道是哪一个吗？”

Asuka nodded. 明日香点头表示同意。

"You can go, if you want. Not to see him," she added, perhaps a bit too hastily, ", but just to, I don't know, get some fresh air? Either case, just remember that we're on standby."  
如果你想，可以离开。不是为了见他，"她可能有些急切地补充，"只是去，比如，透透气？总之，记得我们随时待命。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. 明日香挑起眉毛。

"Standby? You mean him, don't you?"  
待命吗？你指的是他，对吧？

"You were cleared. You're still on active duty."  
你已经没有嫌疑了。现在你还在执行任务中。

"What? I've been out of commission for two weeks, if not more, how am I-"  
什么？我已经休息了两周，甚至可能更久，我怎么-

"You were never taken off the roster." Misato said, "Commander's orders."  
你从未被除名。" 美里解释道，"这是指挥官的指示。

Asuka smiled. She figured that a bit of pride wouldn't hurt her: she was, after all, irreplaceable. Pilot of Unit 02. Even after the disaster she'd rather not remember, even after her sync rate had dropped to zero, she had never been replaced or substituted for.  
明日香微微一笑。她觉得有些骄傲也无妨：毕竟，她是独一无二的。作为二号机的驾驶员，即使在不愿回忆的那场灾难之后，即使她的同步率一度跌至零，她也从未被替代或取代过。

_Hah. I'm Asuka Langey Soryu. That's all there is to it.  
哈哈，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，就这么简单。_

"So, what'll it be?" Misato asked.  
“那么，你决定选哪个呢？”美里问道。

**5**

Asuka opted for a bath.  
明日香决定去洗澡。

She found her room to be clean and orderly, her desk the usual mess. Just out of curiosity, she pulled her desk drawer. The broken SDAT player rattled, its smaller shards shifting. She closed it, still suspicious that they had seen it, that they knew, but quickly reeled herself in. Nobody knew. Nobody was going to know.  
她注意到自己的房间一尘不染，井然有序，唯独书桌依旧杂乱无章。出于一时好奇，她拉开了书桌的抽屉。那台损坏的 SDAT 播放器发出声响，碎片轻微移动。她迅速关上抽屉，心中虽有疑虑，担心他们已经发现，知晓一切，但还是很快平复了情绪。这件事，无人知晓，也将永远保密。

**6**

With the bath drawn, Asuka removed her clothes. Each article discarded brought more exposure, took away more of what was standing between her and the raw surfaces. The cold tile and the porcelain rim, rough now for however many years it had seen layers and layers of dead skin rubbed off on it. The thought made her stomach churn. She thought of all the dust motes floating in the air, and that they, too, were the same thing. Skin shed, skin discarded, skin surrendered to the flow...  
浴缸水满后，明日香开始宽衣。每脱下一件衣物，她与周围原始表面的距离就更近一步。冰冷的瓷砖和粗糙的瓷边，不知经历了多少岁月，上面累积的死皮被一次次磨去。这想法让她感到一阵恶心。她又想到空气中飘浮的尘埃，它们同样是由脱落的皮肤构成。皮肤脱落，被抛弃，最终融入流动之中...

_I'll shed some of my dead skin, then. Come out clean.  
那我就蜕去一些旧皮，出来时焕然一新。_

Asuka removed her sync clips and placed them on the window frame. The red gleam of their glossy surfaces made her smile.  
明日香取下同步夹，轻轻放在窗框上。那光泽闪烁的红色表面，让她不禁露出了微笑。

She stepped into the tub. The water was hot at first, biting at her ankles, but it passed quickly. She crouched first, gradually positioning herself before letting go and sinking up to her neck. She let the motion carry her under. For a few moments, the world was away – under water, she felt completely safe. But she emerged nonetheless, brushing her wet hair back with both hands. She settled in within the moment. She relaxed, her head fell back and hit the towel. She watched the nondescript ceiling.  
她迈入浴缸，热水初时烫得脚踝生疼，但很快便适应了。她先是蹲下，慢慢调整好位置，随后放松身体，沉至颈部。她任由水流带着她下沉，片刻间，世界仿佛远去——在水下，她感到无比安全。然而，她还是浮了上来，双手拨开湿发。她安顿好自己，沉浸在这一刻，放松身心，头向后仰，靠在毛巾上，凝视着那平淡无奇的天花板。

_It's like nothing happened... like I was here yesterday. Nothing's different.  
仿佛一切如常...就像我昨天还在这里。一切都没有变化。_

_Isn't it? Maybe you should look harder, Asuka-chan.  
难道不是吗？或许你该再仔细找找，明日香。_

Just then, she heard the faint, muffled sound of the apartment door sliding open, and a voice that she recognized announced that he was home before closing the door behind him. Asuka felt the comfort of shedding dead skin dissolve fairly quickly, eaten away by a rising, oddly blunted tension that spread from her head to her toes. Almost by instinct, she shifted in the tub, feeling the water bend around her as she pulled her knees up. Dust motes floated in the air, caught in the spot lights bleeding through the frosted glass of the small window.  
就在那时，她听到了公寓门轻轻滑开的声音，一个她熟悉的声音宣布他回来了，随后门在他身后关上。明日香感到那种如蜕皮般的安慰迅速消散，被一种从头顶蔓延至脚尖的、奇怪而迟钝的紧张感所吞噬。几乎是本能地，她在浴缸中挪动身体，感觉到水随着她蜷起膝盖而弯曲。尘埃颗粒在空中飘浮，被从小窗户的磨砂玻璃透进来的聚光灯捕捉。

The house seemed smaller now, somehow, and she felt like she was backed into a corner in the bathroom. The sense of familiarity that had welcomed her was replaced by uncertainty.  
房子现在似乎变小了，她在浴室里感到自己仿佛被逼到了角落。那种曾让她感到亲切的熟悉感，已被不确定性所替代。

Asuka shook her head, grunting with frustration, and pushed the thought away. She tried to relax, released her legs, stretched out, but her body wouldn't settle. It was as if there had been a very specific position she needed to hold in order to relax. Her awareness constantly switched channels; her neck was too strained and when it wasn't, her legs wouldn't settle, and when they did, the towel serving as her pillow wasn't in the right place, and when it was, her hair was too dry at the roots...  
明日香摇摇头，懊恼地哼了一声，试图将那个念头抛诸脑后。她尝试放松，放开双腿，伸展身体，但无论如何都无法真正平静下来。仿佛有一个特定的姿势是她必须保持才能放松的。她的注意力不断转移；脖子感到过度紧绷，而当脖子放松时，双腿又无法安稳，双腿安稳了，用作枕头的毛巾位置又不合适，毛巾位置对了，发根却又过于干燥……

She felt trapped. 她感到自己陷入了困境。

_Maybe because the apartment is not that big... and neither is your room.  
或许是因为公寓并不宽敞，你的房间也同样狭小。_

_Oh, so what? Why should I let it mean anything?  
哦，那又如何？我为何要让它影响我？_

She managed to settle back down, but now it just felt pointless. With a resigned huff, Asuka stepped out. A shower would be just as good, anyway.  
她好不容易才重新安定下来，此刻却感到一切都没有意义。明日香无奈地叹了口气，走出了房间。无论如何，洗个澡或许能让她感觉好些。

**7**

After getting dressed, Asuka took a moment. Wearing one of her usual home outfits, short shorts and a tank top, she had her hair wrapped in a towel. Her plan of action was simple: get out, act like nothing's nothing, get to her room without stopping, and not get out unless it was absolutely necessary.  
穿戴整齐后，明日香稍作停顿。她身着家常的短裤和背心，头发用毛巾包裹。她的行动策略简洁明了：出门，表现得若无其事，径直回到房间，除非万不得已，否则不外出。

All it took was one step out of the door for that particular plan to fall apart.  
仅仅迈出家门一步，那个特别的计划就彻底失败了。

There he was. Apron on. Straight-backed, eyes focused, hands like those of a surgeon, steady and precise, he was busy with the ingredients of whatever would be dinner after their ritual mutilation. He had the stove dominated with one frying pan and three pots, and the counter was occupied by an assortment of things necessary to do what he was doing. Asuka, one hand on the towel, hesitated.  
他站在那里，系着围裙，腰背挺直，眼神专注，双手稳如外科医生，精确无误地处理着即将成为晚餐的食材。炉灶上，一个煎锅和三个锅掌控全局，而料理台上则摆满了各种必需品，以便他进行烹饪。明日香一手搭在毛巾上，显得有些迟疑。

"Dinner won't be long." Shinji said, without taking his eyes off the tomatoes he was dicing at an even pace, "Mr. Kaji will be joining us."  
晚餐很快就好。" 真嗣一边说着，一边继续专注地切着西红柿，"加持先生也会来和我们一起用餐。

The tomato's end. Push with the blade. New one. Switch.  
番茄切到末端时，用刀片推压。换一个新的番茄，进行切换。

He wouldn't even look at her.  
他连看都不愿意看她一眼。

_Why does he even bother fucking saying anything?  
他何必费神去说些什么呢？_

_Maybe he's just treading carefully, Asuka-chan.  
或许他只是谨慎行事，明日香。_

_Treading where? There's nowhere to go in this place.  
这里无处可走，该往哪儿踩呢？_

Asuka could only make a noncommittal sound, nod and force herself to walk instead of running. She passed by Misato, who was busy writing something (judging by the frequent appearance of the word "Evangelion" at a glance, drafting a report,) and walked into her room. She shut the door, cursing the lack of locks, but took comfort in the fact that the Wall of Jericho firmly in place.  
明日香只能含糊地应了一声，点点头，强迫自己慢慢走而不是跑。她经过正在忙碌书写的美里（从频繁出现的“福音战士”一词判断，应该是在撰写报告），走进了自己的房间。她关上门，虽然不满没有锁，但耶利哥之墙的坚固让她感到些许安慰。

The sense of safety disappeared when she recalled that the door was just made of wood.  
她一想起那扇门不过是木头做的，心中的安全感便荡然无存。

**8**

Asuka wandered her room, like a rat trapped in a maze, going from one useless thing to the next, feeling like she could scream loud enough to shatter the windows and peel the wallpaper clean off. Her skin was itching from the inside, and every other moment recalled his distant voice, his eyes that wouldn't look at her.  
明日香在房间里游荡，仿佛一只陷入迷宫的老鼠，从一个无用的物品转向另一个，感觉自己尖叫的力量足以震碎窗户，彻底剥落墙纸。她的皮肤从内而外感到瘙痒，不时回想起他那遥远的嗓音，以及他那不愿与她对视的眼睛。

"_Anyone with half a brain would stay the hell away from me."_  
但凡有点理智的人都会避我如蛇蝎。

Asuka bit her tongue until it went numb from the pain.  
明日香咬紧舌头，直至痛感令其麻木。

**9**

Dinner was short, silent and strained. Shinji had worked his magic, it looked like something that would befit a special occasion. To Asuka it was delicious, familiar and oddly nostalgic. To Asuka, it was tasteless.  
晚餐简短、沉默且紧张。真嗣施展了他的厨艺，呈现出一道适合特殊场合的美味佳肴。对明日香而言，这顿饭美味、熟悉，且带着一种莫名的怀旧感。然而，对明日香来说，它却毫无味道。

**10**

As Kaji ate his last mouthful, Misato opened up another can of beer, her fourth since they had begun eating, and Kaji lit up a cigarette, offering a compliment to Shinji's culinary skills.  
加持刚咽下最后一口食物，美里便打开了另一罐啤酒，这已是她用餐以来的第四罐。与此同时，加持点燃了一支烟，对真嗣的厨艺赞不绝口。

"I'm glad you enjoyed it." Shinji said with a polite nod.  
"我很高兴你喜欢。" 真嗣礼貌地点头说。

"Enjoy it while it lasts." Misato murmured.  
"趁现在好好享受吧。" 美里轻声说道。

"Now, now, Katsuragi, why go there?" Kaji asked, leaning back, "It's a nice evening."  
好了，好了，葛城，何必去那儿呢？" 加持说着，向后仰去，"今晚是个好天气。

"Go where?" Asuka asked, "What's going on?"  
去哪儿？" 明日香问道，"出什么事了？

Kaji sighed. 卡吉轻叹一声。

"Well, you broke it, you buy it." He said.  
“你弄坏了，就得你买。”他如此说道。

"The next Angel is coming in three days' time." Misato said, "The MAGI's second prediction came in today."  
三天后，新的天使即将降临。" 美里说道，"今天，MAGI 系统发布了第二次预测。

Asuka felt her heart skip a few beats before starting to beat faster. There was a crawling sensation under her skin, and she could feel her palms going cold.  
明日香心跳漏了几拍，随后加速跳动。她感到皮肤下有股蠕动感，手掌也逐渐冰凉。

"Unit 03 will also be arriving an hour or so before that. Maybe even into the thick of it, I don't know, it's cutting too close..." Misato went on. She took a giant gulp of her beer, "So yeah. Now you know."  
单元 03 也会在那之前的一小时左右到达。或许还会陷入其中，我也不确定，时间太紧了……"美里接着说。她猛灌了一大口啤酒，"总之，现在你明白了。

Asuka could feel Kaji watching her out of the corner of his eye as he smoked. She kept her palms flat on the table, feeling every irregularity in the wood, and faked being very interested in the pattern of Kaji's tie.  
明日香察觉到 Kaji 一边抽烟，一边用眼角的余光打量着她。她将手掌平摊在桌面上，细细感受着木纹的凹凸不平，同时装作对 Kaji 领带上的图案十分着迷。

Inside, she could feel an emotion that was familiar yet foreign to her: fear. Fear, apprehension, rising panic all mixed into one, hissing in her mind like the valve of a pipe, screaming that it was about to burst from the pressure.  
她内心深处感受到一种既熟悉又陌生的情绪：恐惧。恐惧、忧虑和不断上升的恐慌交织在一起，如同管道阀门在她脑海中嘶嘶作响，预示着压力即将爆发。

_I just got back to the land of the living, if you can even call it that, for God's sake!  
我刚回到这个所谓的“人间”，说真的，你还能称之为“人间”吗？_

"Now that I'm back, we don't need the backup." She said.  
“既然我已经回来，备份就不再需要了。” 她解释道。

Misato was silent. 美里陷入了沉默。

"We are lucky that way." Kaji said, looking at Misato as if he wanted her to say something more on the subject, but Misato was lost in herself.  
"我们真是幸运。" 卡吉说道，目光投向美里，似乎期待她能对此话题再多说几句，然而美里却沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"I wonder who the pilot is?" Shinji asked, "They didn't tell us anything."  
我想知道飞行员是谁？" 真嗣问道，"他们什么都没告诉我们。

Kaji glared at Misato, who knocked the can back.  
卡吉瞪着美里，只见她将罐子里的饮料一饮而尽。

"Well, NERV likes to play it close to the chest." Kaji said, "You know last-minute these things are."  
“嗯，NERV 总是喜欢把事情捂得严严实实。”加持说，“你知道的，这些事总是拖到最后一刻才揭晓。”

_I don't need another one in the mess. It'll just complicate things... needlessly.  
在这纷乱之中，我无需再添一物。那样只会无端增加复杂性。_

_Is that really why you're scared, Asuka-chan?  
明日香，你真的因为这个而害怕吗？_

_Oh, fuck you! I'm not scared of anybody! Let him come - I'll show him how it's done!  
哼，你算什么！我谁也不怕！让他来试试——我会让他见识见识我的厉害！_

_I didn't say it was the new pilot you were scared of... or that it would be a boy.  
我并没有说你害怕的是新来的飞行员，也没说那会是个男孩。_

_Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.  
别说了。赶紧给我闭嘴。_

"Whoever he is, he better not get in my way." Asuka said, crossing her arms, "Three's a crowd already, and I don't need some newbie pilot slowing me down in the field."  
不管他是谁，最好别妨碍我。" 明日香交叉着双臂说，"三个人已经够多了，我不需要一个新手飞行员在战场上拖慢我的速度。

Asuka pretended not to notice Shinji's sideways glance, just as she pretended not to notice Kaji's knowing half-smile. She pretended not to notice the bitter taste in her mouth.  
明日香佯装未察觉真嗣的斜睨，亦如她对加持那心领神会的浅笑视而不见。她同样假装未感受到口中那股苦涩的滋味。

### Chapter 16 Philharmonic

**Movement 15 第十五运动  
"Philharmonic" 交响乐团**

**1**

Asuka dreamt of the hanging tree. A mighty, desolate tree without leaves, from the branches of which hung not fruit, but nooses. Some nooses were occupied by people billowing peacefully in the nightfall breeze, arms and legs moving loosely. Others hung hollow. She had no idea what she was supposed to do there. All she felt was fear. A crippling, ice-cold fear that reminded her, that the grassy field around her should not have smelled like antiseptic, plastic and hard-washed sheets. There was a bleeping sound, echoing in the air, distant and shrill, almost like a voice, a small voice belonging to a small girl...  
明日香梦见了那棵悬挂的树。一棵雄伟而荒凉的无叶之树，枝条上挂着的不是果实，而是绳套。有些绳套中有人平静地在夜幕微风中飘荡，四肢随意摆动。其他的则空空如也。她不知道自己应该在那里做什么。她只感到恐惧。一种令人瘫痪的冰冷恐惧，提醒她，周围的草地不应该散发出消毒剂、塑料和硬洗床单的味道。空气中回荡着一种哔哔声，遥远而尖锐，几乎像一个声音，一个小女孩的微弱声音……

_Ma-_

Asuka woke up to the start to her alarm clock's steady beeping. The metronome rhythm betrayed her racing pulse.  
明日香被闹钟规律的哔哔声唤醒，那稳定的节奏却透露出她内心的紧张与不安。

**2**

When she stumbled out of bed, she found the house empty. Checking the clock to make sure she was still on time, she saw that she was. Misato would be gone, she knew, on the eve of an Angel attack, as she always was. That only left...  
她从床上挣扎着起身，发现屋内空荡荡的。她瞥了一眼时钟，确认自己并未迟到，时间尚早。她知道，每当使徒来袭前夕，美里总会外出，这次也不例外。于是，屋里只剩下...

There was a lunch box on the kitchen table, wrapped neatly in the red-cornered cloth Asuka had picked out for herself. There was a small piece of paper propped up against it. She touched it to see if it was last night's leftovers. The box was rather warm. The small piece of paper read:  
厨房桌上放着一个午餐盒，用明日香精心挑选的红边布料仔细包裹着。旁边立着一张小纸条。她轻轻触摸，想知道是否是昨晚的剩菜。盒子摸起来相当温热。小纸条上写着：

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Asuka Langley Soryuu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

Asuka noticed that his kanji was much more precise than the Latin letters scribbled underneath it.  
明日香发现，他的汉字书写比下面潦草的拉丁字母要精确得多。

"_You're the genius, you figure it out."_  
你是天才，自己想办法解决吧。

Asuka clenched her teeth.  
明日香紧紧咬住牙关。

_Of all the shit you could pull, you-  
你能搞的破事多了去了，你——_

_Now, now, Asuka-chan, let's not go somewhere we'll regret going, shall we?  
好了，好了，明日香，我们别去那些会让我们后悔的地方，好吗？_

_Regret what? He's only doing this because I told him to!  
有什么好后悔的？他这样做完全是因为我让他这么做的！_

_Is he, now? For someone who's "staying the hell away from you," he's very nice about it.  
他现在这样吗？对于一个声称“离你远点”的人，他表现得倒是挺客气的。_

_Whatever. It's too early to deal with all this anyway. I'm not going to let this stunt fuck up my day.  
无所谓了，现在处理这些还为时过早。我不会让这种小把戏影响我的一天。_

**3**

After getting ready as usual, Asuka gently plucked the bento box from the table and stuffed it into her bag. It was a tight fit, but it wouldn't be damaged. She went out, into the smell of the sun lingering in the air. With her sync clips in place, her school uniform that despite its rather plain style fit her tightly in all the right places wrapped around her, she felt the tension of the mocking note melt away. It was like it had never even happened, and she hadn't taken the time to burn it on the stove.  
一如往常地准备妥当后，Asuka 轻柔地从桌上拿起便当盒，小心翼翼地塞进书包。虽然空间紧凑，但足以确保便当盒完好无损。她踏出家门，空气中还残留着阳光的余温。佩戴好同步夹，尽管校服设计简约，却完美贴合她的身形，让她感到那张嘲讽纸条带来的紧张感悄然消解。仿佛那件事从未发生，她也没有特意在炉火上将其焚毁。

Once she was set on the road, she found that she felt refreshed; almost beautiful, in a way.  
一旦她踏上旅程，便感到精神一振，仿佛在某种程度上焕发出了美丽。

The heat radiating off of the asphalt didn't bother her as much as it used to, the symphony of cicadas following her made for another small game, where she kept rhythm with her steps to interrupt their near-ambient chittering, composing a unique kind of music.  
柏油路面散发的热气已不再像过去那样让她感到不适，她身后的蝉鸣交响乐反而成了一种小游戏。她用脚步的节奏去打断那几乎成为背景的蝉鸣，创造出一种独特的音乐。

_None of this will save me.  
这些都无法救我于水火。_

But none of it would kill her, either. Humming to add a third instrument, Asuka made her way down the hill, her own philharmonic, making something beautiful out of nothing.  
然而，这一切都不会对她造成致命伤害。阿斯卡哼着小调，仿佛在为这旋律增添第三种乐器，她缓缓走下山坡，宛如一位指挥家，将一片空白转化为动人的乐章。

**4**

Hikari greeted her more warmly than she had imagined. Before Asuka could do anything, she rushed to her and pulled her into a tight hug, telling her how glad she was that she had recovered, asking her about the injury Shinji had made up. Asuka, feeling discomforted for having to lie to her friend, decided to lie with the truth. She twisted a few facts, omitted a few crucial ones and made her story fit into the cracks of Shinji's. They went to class, chatting away about normal, trivial things.  
光对她的问候比她预想的还要热情。在明日香还没反应过来之前，光就冲上前去紧紧拥抱她，表达自己对她康复的喜悦，并询问起真嗣编造的伤情。明日香因不得不对朋友撒谎而感到不安，于是决定用真相来编织谎言。她巧妙地扭曲了一些事实，省略了几个关键细节，使得自己的故事与真嗣的版本无缝对接。两人随后去上课，闲聊着日常琐事。

Upon entering the classroom, Asuka missed a step. He was there, too. Sitting in his corner, chin cradled in his palm, staring out the window. Daydreaming, no doubt, of whatever stupid things he daydreamed about.  
刚踏入教室，明日香不小心绊了一下。他也在那儿，蜷缩在角落，下巴抵着手掌，目光投向窗外。无疑是在做白日梦，想着那些他常幻想的傻事。

"And the Red Baroness returns."  
红男爵夫人再度归来。

Asuka glanced over her shoulder to see a grinning Kensuke. She simply scoffed, and got to her seat.  
明日香回头瞥了一眼，只见健介咧嘴笑着。她不屑一顾，随即坐回了自己的座位。

"What, no comeback?" Kensuke asked. Asuka's death glare made him smile, but she could see that his smile was tense, not happy. When she turned to Hikari again, she was smiling, too.  
"怎么，不回击吗？" 健介问道。明日香那锐利的目光让他露出了笑容，但她能看出他的笑容里带着紧张，并非真正的快乐。当她再次看向光时，光也在微笑。

Kensuke's voice piercing through the morning chatter as he went to engage Shinji as if he was engaging an enemy (_as if_), she caught a look of concern on Hikari's face.  
健介的声音在晨间的喧闹中显得格外刺耳，他走向真嗣，仿佛面对的是敌人，此时，她捕捉到了光脸上闪过的一丝忧虑。

"What's wrong?" Asuka asked.  
"出什么事了？" 明日香问道。

"He didn't show up today."  
他今天没来。

"Who didn't?" 谁没做过呢？

"Toji." 冬治。

"There's still time. He's probably practicing his manly postures in the boy's bathroom or something."  
时间还来得及。他大概在男厕所里练习那些男子汉的姿态吧，或者类似的事情。

_Asuka-chan! 明日香，你好！_

Hikari flinched. Asuka's half-smile vanished.  
光里微微一颤，明日香那半带笑意的表情也随之消失。

"It's not like him." She said, "They'd tell me if he'd called in sick."  
她說：“他不像是會這樣做的人。如果他打電話請病假，他們會告訴我的。”

"Doesn't he visit his sister some days?" Asuka asked, unsure if knowing that was a good thing or not. Hikari shook her head.  
"他不是偶尔会去看他妹妹吗？" 明日香问道，不确定知道这一点是好是坏。光摇了摇头。

"Not today." 今天不行。

"How do you know that?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"你怎么知道的？" 明日香挑眉问道。

"I'm the class rep. He always tells me the day before. It's not like him..." Hikari crossed her hands on her lap, "It's just not like him."  
我是班级的代表。他通常都会提前一天告诉我。但这次的行为不太像他……" 光交叉双手放在膝上，"确实不像他平时的作风。

**5**

Classes went by in a blur. Stupid kanji was written on the board. Stupid kanji was in her books. She was writing less precisely than Shinji fucking Ikari had on his motherfucking note. Still, she wouldn't be caught dead lagging behind just because of that, in fact, knowing what she knew, she was leagues beyond any other foreigner. On a league of her own, higher on the food chain.  
课程匆匆而过，一切显得模糊。黑板上是那些愚蠢的汉字，她的书里也是。她的书写精确度甚至不如真嗣那家伙在他那该死的笔记上。尽管如此，她绝不会因此落后，实际上，凭借她所掌握的知识，她远超其他外国人，独树一帜，处于更高的层次。

Still, she thought about one of Kaji's observations, that school was too much like institutionalized torture where you did learn a few things, and those only by accident. The break periods were when Asuka learned, entirely by accident as she wasn't splitting her attention to eavesdrop on a particular loser, no way, that Shinji had told those in the know the bruises on his neck was due to him trying to put on a tie. He had, the story went, fumbled the knot and had found that he couldn't relax it until the stupid thing was choking him. Misato had saved him right after he had passed out.  
尽管如此，她仍记得卡吉的一些见解，认为学校过于严苛，虽偶有所学，但那纯属意外。课间休息时，明日香无意中得知，真嗣曾向知情者透露，他脖子上的瘀伤是因为尝试打领带时不慎打错结，无法解开，直至几乎窒息。幸好美里及时赶到，在他昏迷后救了他。

Asuka learned this via Kensuke, his voice breaking through a few boys from other classes, interested to hear why Shinji had tried to hang himself. So the rumor went, it seemed.  
明日香是从真嗣那里得知的，他的声音穿透了几个来自其他班级的男孩，他们都想知道为什么真嗣会试图上吊自杀。看来这就是传闻的来源。

"Even if that were true, chief, I still say those look like finger marks."  
“就算那是真的，长官，我依然觉得那些像是手指印。”

"No, you see..." 不，你听我说……

It was one of Kaji's, one of those thin ties you see on those weird musicians nowadays. Plus, he had twisted it tight enough and in attempt to pull it loose...  
这是加治的领带，那种薄薄的款式，就像当今那些古怪音乐家所佩戴的。他把它扭得相当紧，正试图将其松开……

"...I basically choked myself with my own hands."  
...我基本上是用手掐住了自己。

Hikari's absent-minded chatter about carrying furniture into the shelters so that they wouldn't need to kneel on mats faded into the background, as did the rest of the idle voices resonating through the classroom.  
光关于将家具搬进避难所以免跪在垫子上的心不在焉的闲聊，与教室中其他闲散的声音一同渐渐消散。

_Why are you lying to them? Why aren't you just telling them what happened?  
你为何要欺骗他们？何不直接告知他们真相？_

Asuka glanced at her notebook, at the crooked edges of imprecise strokes.  
明日香扫了一眼她的笔记本，目光停留在那些笔触不精确而显得歪斜的边缘上。

_Why don't you just say something..?  
你为何不直接说些什么呢？_

**6**

_With his own hands. But those weren't his own. Those hands were mine.  
他用的是自己的双手。然而，那些手并非他的，而是我的。_

_Maybe, Asuka-chan, he means it.  
或许，明日香，他是真心实意的。_

Asuka stood up to feign respect for her teacher, whatever her name was.  
明日香站起身，装作对那位连名字都不记得的老师表示敬意。

**7**

Lunch hour came, prompting a rush to find the nearest available food source and deplete it as quickly as possible. Lunch hour normally had an urgency, Asuka had noticed, as nobody in the school knew if they'd be able to eat, or if they'd be killed by an Angel's careless swipe, or rushed to the shelters before they could get a single bite in. For Asuka, this was different only in the way that if she wasn't actually killed, she'd have to rush to the nearest NERV center to get to GeoFront. LCL satiated her hunger, but it just wasn't the same.  
午餐时间一到，学生们便纷纷涌向最近的餐厅，急切地想要尽快填饱肚子。明日香发现，这种紧迫感在校园里尤为明显，因为谁也无法预料下一刻是否还能安然进食，或是被天使的攻击夺去生命，甚至在被紧急疏散前连一口饭都来不及吃。对明日香而言，这种紧迫感还意味着，即便她侥幸生还，也必须立即赶往最近的 NERV 中心，以便进入 GeoFront。虽然 LCL 能暂时缓解饥饿，但那种感觉终究无法与真正的食物相比。

As the bell rang its last, Asuka, almost instinctively, turned to a particular seat. Right on cue, he got up, took his lunch, and walked out of the classroom. Kensuke, as if also on cue, got his own, and engaged some of his other friends. Asuka ate with Hikari, distracting her with anecdotes of what her injury had been like, peppering it with unnecessary details, technobabble and medical jargon she had picked up while she was in the hospital. She distracted her to distract herself from her awareness of something else.  
铃声落下之际，明日香几乎本能地望向一个特定的座位。恰在此时，他起身拿起午餐，离开了教室。健介也似乎按部就班，取了自己的午餐，与几位朋友交谈起来。明日香与光共进午餐，用她受伤经历的趣闻轶事来分散光的注意力，其间掺杂了许多不必要的细节、技术术语和她在医院期间学到的医学术语。她这样做，是为了转移自己对其他事情的注意力。

The dull needle kept prodding.  
那根钝针持续不断地戳刺着。

Asuka caught a silent moment, and then, excusing herself, walked out of the classroom. She headed for the roof exit, wading through hordes and hordes of students, catching stray words and half-sentences along the way. She felt like she was running a gauntlet through the crowd.  
明日香趁机找了个安静的片刻，随后找了个借口走出教室。她朝着屋顶的出口走去，在密集的学生群中穿行，一路上听到些零散的词句。她觉得自己仿佛在人群中艰难前行。

She was a few steps away from the door of the staircase when it opened, letting Rei Ayanami through. She stood in the doorway, face expressionless, one pale hand holding the door open.  
她距离楼梯间的门仅几步之遥，此时门突然打开，绫波零从中走出。她站在门口，脸上毫无表情，一只苍白的手扶着门，使其保持开启状态。

"Can I help you?" Asuka asked.  
"需要我帮忙吗？" 明日香问道。

Rei didn't say anything. That she was standing there like a mannequin began to make Asuka's blood boil.  
丽一言不发。她像模特般僵立在那儿，这让明日香怒火中烧。

_You freak. 你真是个怪人。_

"Do you mind!?" Asuka asked, cocking her head towards the staircase. Rei lingered. Her blank expression, glazed-over eyes and silence reminded Asuka of the dream she had had... of all the nooses billowing gently...  
"你介意吗？" 明日香问道，头偏向楼梯。绫波停下脚步。她那空洞的表情、呆滞的眼神和沉默让明日香回想起那个梦……梦里所有绞索轻轻飘动……

_You fucking doll. 你这个该死的傀儡。_

"Get out of my way!"  
让开，别挡路！

Rei shuffled aside, pressing her back against the door and holding it open, still. Asuka felt her eyes follow her. As she brushed past, the redheaded pilot spied something Rei was holding close to her chest. Her pale, thin fingers were even paler by the force with which she was holding onto the worn-out book.  
丽侧身让开，背靠门板，保持门敞开的状态。明日香察觉到她的视线紧随自己。当她经过时，红发的驾驶员注意到丽紧抱在胸前的物品——一本破旧的书。丽那苍白纤细的手指，因用力紧握书本而显得更加无血色。

_Peter Pan. 彼得潘。_

Asuka shuddered. She was glad to be in the semi-dark of the staircase leading to the roof. There was a light, however faint, at the end of that particular tunnel.  
明日香不禁颤抖。她很高兴能待在通往屋顶的昏暗楼梯间里。至少在那条路的尽头，还有一线微弱的希望之光。

**6**

He was lying on his back, in the shade of the dysfunctional air vent exhaust, one arm tucked behind his head. Asuka saw, upon taking a slow step towards him, that black earbuds were lodged in his ears. On his chest, cradled gently under his free hand, was the bulky, familiar shape of the SDAT player. For a moment there, she thought, and somewhat shirked from the thought that, he had maybe found it in her desk drawer after all, and had fixed it.  
他仰面躺着，躺在那失灵的空调排气口的阴影下，一只手臂枕在头后。明日香缓缓走近，注意到他耳朵里塞着黑色耳塞。他胸前，被空着的那只手轻轻托着，正是那个笨重而熟悉的 SDAT 播放器。有那么一刻，她心中闪过一个念头，甚至有些回避这个想法：他或许真的在她书桌抽屉里找到了它，并且修好了。

_Even worse... that means he knows I still keep it.  
更糟糕的是...这表明他知道我至今还留着它。_

Asuka shook her head. He had probably gotten hold of one of the seven forms she had marched into his hospital room with.  
明日香摇了摇头。他大概拿到了她当初带着闯进他病房的那七种形式之一。

Shinji hadn't yet noticed her. His eyes were closed and one of his fingers on the SDAT player was tapping rhythmically. His head would move, just slightly, forming another component of the rhythm section.  
真嗣尚未察觉到她的存在。他双眼紧闭，手指在 SDAT 播放器上随着节奏轻敲，头部也微微摆动，为这节奏增添了一份动感。

_He looks... so immersed. At peace.  
他显得如此沉浸其中，平静安详。_

She considered turning around and heading back down. A flash in her mind and her hands recalled being Kaji's tie that wouldn't relax. The memory of is caress resurfaced, overwhelmed her. She began to sweat profusely, her pulse rising. She took a deep breath to steady herself and pushed it down.  
她曾想过转身返回，但脑海中突然闪现的画面让她双手不由自主地回想起曾是卡吉那条紧绷的领带。他温柔的抚摸记忆再次涌现，让她感到一阵心慌。她开始大汗淋漓，心跳加速。为了平复心情，她深吸一口气，努力将这些情绪压下。

_There'll be time for that in just a few moments.  
稍后不久就有时间处理那件事了。_

_Come on, Asuka-chan. 加油，明日香。_

_Quit it. Here I go.  
别闹了，我这就去。_

### Chapter 17 Epilogue
**(Mosquito Coil) （蚊香）**

Maaya Sakamoto's _"Birds"_ was one of the tracks in his mixtape, Shinji's awareness of the contents placing it at 24. He was rather fond of the lyrics; _"I'll fly through the air and reach out, no matter what."_ It used to make him think of flying away from his aunt and uncle's backyard shed. Now it reminded him of night-time Tokyo-3 spreading before him as he piloted Unit 01 for the first time. He knew he was probably remembering the incident differently than it had actually been, but he didn't care. Sometimes, it was alright to lie.  
坂本真绫的《Birds》是碇真嗣混音带中的一首曲目，他根据自己对内容的了解将其排在第 24 位。他特别喜欢那句歌词：“无论发生什么，我都会飞向天空，伸手触及。”这曾让他联想到逃离姨妈和姨父家的后院小屋。如今，这让他想起了首次驾驶初号机时，夜晚的第三新东京市在他眼前展开的景象。他明白自己对那次事件的记忆可能与事实有出入，但他并不介意。有时候，适当的谎言也无伤大雅。

A shadow falling over him jerked him away from the song, which was almost at its end. He squinted, trying to see.  
一道阴影突然笼罩在他身上，打断了他即将听完的歌曲。他眯起眼睛，努力想要看清楚。

Familiar red hair shifted his thumb to the stop button and the sounds of the world around him came flooding in.  
他那熟悉的红发随着拇指移向停止按钮，四周的世界声响随即涌入耳中。

As Shinji took out his earbuds, Asuka smiled.  
真嗣摘下耳塞的那一刻，明日香露出了微笑。

"You're in my spot." She said.  
“你坐了我的位置。”她这样说道。

Shinji sat up. He wrapped the headphones around the player, and stood up without a word. He made it three steps before Asuka's hand on his shoulder gave him pause.  
真嗣坐起身，将耳机缠绕在播放器上，随即默默站起。他才迈出三步，明日香搭在他肩上的手便让他止步。

"Can we talk?" 我们能聊聊吗？

Shinji's expression told her that she needed to be a bit less aggressive.  
真嗣的表情让她明白，自己应该稍微收敛一些攻击性。

"Please." 请说。

She sat down and crossed her legs. Shinji followed suit and plopped down next to her.  
她坐下并翘起二郎腿，真嗣也跟着坐下，一屁股坐在她旁边。

"I see you have a new one." She said.  
“我看到你新买了一个。” 她说。

"Yeah." 对。

"The old one's in my desk drawer."  
旧的那个放在我书桌的抽屉里。

Shinji cast a curious glance at her, trying to see if she was serious.  
真嗣好奇地瞥了她一眼，想看看她是否当真。

"I tried to fix it after you left. I couldn't figure it out, it was too old... but I didn't throw it away."  
你走后我试图修复它，但太陈旧了，我弄不明白……不过我没有把它丢掉。

"...thanks." ...谢谢。

"Gott in Himmel, this whole thing is _so_ fucked up."  
天啊，这一切真是糟透了。

"I guess." 我想应该是。

"I'll be honest with you..."  
老实跟你说...

"Okay." 好的。

"I don't want you to die." Shinji looked to see her look away, "I don't want you to hurt. But, like with other things, sometimes you just let me. And if you let me, I will."  
我不想你离开。" 真嗣望向她，见她别过头去，"我不想你受苦。但就像其他事情一样，有时候你只是任由我。如果你任由我，我会这么做。

_You are open to me, that I know. You keep most at a distance, but if I want to, I can reach in. To be open is to be vulnerable... and you will never know.  
你对我敞开心扉，这一点我心知肚明。你与多数人保持距离，但只要我愿意，便能触及你的内心。敞开心扉意味着脆弱，而你对此一无所知。_

"When you were in there, with the Angel... I tried to do something. Anything. I couldn't. And you know what their plan was? What they would have done unless you got out?" he shook his head, "They were going to have us cancel the A.T. Field and then they were going to bomb the living shit out of it... and you."  
当你和天使在里面时……我曾试图采取行动，无论什么行动。但我无能为力。你知道他们的计划吗？如果你们没能逃出来，他们会怎么做？他摇了摇头，“他们计划让我们解除 A.T.力场，然后彻底炸毁那里……以及你。”

Shinji swallowed hard. 真嗣费力地咽了口唾沫。

"I... couldn't do anything." She took handfuls of yellow fabric into her fists, "I rushed ahead, and I would have made it, too... but then..." she hissed through clenched teeth, "You and your over-hundred-precent."  
我...无能为力。" 她紧握着大把的黄色布料，"我奋力向前，本可以赶到的...但后来..." 她咬牙切齿地低声说，"你和你那总是超额完成的精神。

"I never thought it'd give me an edge over you." Shinji said, prompting her eyes to fly wide open in surprise, "I was 60 plus on my first run, yeah, but I couldn't even walk properly. It only means something if... strange stuff happens. Or if I was like you, born a pilot. I'm not. I'm just the Third Children. That whole training thing was because my father knew I was just making it up as I went along. That I was just getting lucky." He smiled wistfully, "When Dr. Akagi first said it, I... I was happy. If I could pilot better, then I would be more useful."  
我从没想过这会让我比你更有优势。" 真嗣说道，这让她惊讶得眼睛睁得大大的，"我第一次跑的时候是 60 多分，但我甚至走不好。只有在发生奇怪的事情时，这才有意义。或者如果我像你一样，天生就是飞行员。我不是。我只是第三适格者。整个训练是因为我父亲知道我只是边做边编。我只是运气好。" 他苦笑着说，"当赤木博士第一次这么说的时候，我...我很高兴。如果我能驾驶得更好，那么我就会更有用。

"I just might strangle you right now. _Again._"  
我可能真的会现在就掐死你。又一次。

Shinji's hand shot up to his neck. Asuka caught the move.  
真嗣的手突然伸向颈部，明日香立刻察觉到了他的动作。

"Own up to it." She said, looking him straight in the eye, "You came way too far for someone who was just winging it. Don't cheapen it by making excuses for it. It's outrageous and is an insult to me."  
“坦白吧。”她直视着他的眼睛说，“你走得太远了，对于一个只是随便试试的人来说。不要用借口来贬低它。这太离谱了，对我也是一种侮辱。”

Shinji took a moment. Then he laughed. As Asuka watched him, wondering if he had finally snapped, he smiled at her. She felt something stir in her chest, something warm, at the genuine emotion he was baring to her – she felt as if she was staring right into his soul.  
真嗣顿了顿，随即笑了起来。明日香看着他，心中疑惑他是否终于承受不住，他却对她展露微笑。她感到心中涌起一股暖意，这是因为他向她流露的真挚情感——她仿佛能直视他的内心深处。

"I missed you." He blurted out. The way he said it prompted a blush on her part, which, in turn, put her in a place she didn't like being: she stumbled. She fumbled for words.  
“我想你了。”他突然说道。他的话让她脸颊泛红，这让她感到不自在，以至于说话都结巴起来。她慌乱地寻找合适的词句。

"W-well, I'm here, a-and it's not like... it's not like anyone noticed."  
嗯，我在这儿，好像也没人注意到。

"Well, I did." He said, "But... there's one thing..."  
“是的，我做了。”他接着说，“不过……还有一件事……”

"Oh, out with it." 哦，快说吧。

"Why didn't you kill me?"  
你为何不把我杀掉？

Asuka looked down. 明日香垂下了头。

"Because I don't want you to die, like I said."  
“因为我不想你像我说的那样死去。”

"You seemed pretty sure back there."  
你刚才显得很有把握。

"I don't always know what I want, alright?" she said, huffing, "Or how I want it. Like that..." a painful memory, _swallow it down, just this once, make an exception, then you'll bury it._ "...like that night."  
“我并非总能明确自己想要什么，明白吗？”她有些恼怒地说，“甚至不清楚我想要的方式。比如那次……”一段痛苦的回忆，强忍下去，就这一次，破例一次，然后将其深埋。“……就像那个夜晚。”

"I remember that you cut off my air supply then, too."  
我记得那时你也中断了我呼吸的空气。

Asuka turned crimson. 明日香的脸颊瞬间变得绯红。

"Idiot! That's not the point!"  
傻瓜！那根本不是关键！

"Then what's the point?" 那又有什么意义呢？

_Come on, Asuka-chan. 加油，明日香。_

Asuka caught his –now curious- gaze.  
明日香察觉到了他此刻充满好奇的眼神。

"I'm sorry." She said, "I'm sorry."  
对不起。" 她重复道，"对不起。

Shinji moved before she could stop her, and wrapped his arms around her. Asuka was startled beyond the telling of it – she was both irked by his sudden closeness, but some part of her liked it. Liked that he was making a move, bridging the gap. Her reaction was light and reserved, her hands on his back, but she could feel his warmth, under her palms and against her, and found herself liking it, if only slightly.  
真嗣在她阻止之前就动了，双臂环绕着她。明日香惊得无法言表——她既因他突如其来的亲近而恼火，但内心某处又喜欢这样。喜欢他主动出击，缩短距离。她的反应轻柔而克制，手放在他的背上，但她能感受到他手掌下的温暖，以及贴着自己的温度，发现自己即使只是略微地，也喜欢这种感觉。

He pulled back before too long, muttering an apology. She rolled her eyes.  
他很快便退开，低声道歉。她不以为意地翻了个白眼。

_Some things will never change.  
有些事物是永恒不变的。_

"So, umm..." Shinji said, "What now?"  
“那么，嗯……” 真嗣问道，“接下来我们该做什么？”

"We have a sync test after this, so I say we ditch the afternoon class."  
我们之后有个同步测试，所以我觉得取消下午的课比较好。

"We can't do that!" 我们无法那样做！

"Why not?" she asked with a smile. She got up and offered her hand. After a moment's hesitation, Shinji took it and rose to his feet.  
“为什么不呢？”她微笑着问道。她站起身，伸出手。经过短暂的犹豫，真嗣握住了她的手，随之站起。

Asuka lead on and Shinji followed her down.  
明日香走在前面，真嗣紧随其后。

### Chapter 18 Coda

**(Something for the Pain) （缓解疼痛的东西）**

With a desperate scream, Shinji's fist slammed onto the wall, again and again and again until his hand, broken, or so he hoped, refused to move. It hung limply by his side. He stared at the bloody cavity he had made. Raw pain traveled across his arm, pulsating. His heart was pounding. Sweat was pouring out of every pore and breathing heavily, Shinji felt his knees buckle and fell to the floor. His forehead brushed against the wall. The wallpaper felt rough against his skin.  
真嗣发出绝望的尖叫，拳头一次又一次猛击墙壁，直至手部受伤，他希望如此，无法再动。拳头无力地垂在身侧，他凝视着自己造成的血迹斑斑的凹陷。剧痛沿着手臂蔓延，阵阵脉动。心跳如鼓，汗水淋漓，呼吸急促，真嗣双腿一软，跌坐在地。额头轻触墙面，墙纸的粗糙质感刺激着他的皮肤。

Inside his chest, there was a surge, an energy that kept expanding. No matter how hard he tried to expel it, it was still there, clawing at his skin.  
他的胸中涌动着一股力量，不断膨胀。尽管他竭力想要摆脱，这股力量却始终存在，撕扯着他的肌肤。

"It's useless..." he heard himself say, unaware that he was even speaking, "It's too late..."  
这没用..." 他听到自己喃喃自语，却未察觉自己已开口，"已经太迟了...

When the tears came, he didn't know how many times it had been. His eyes ached, the distant memory of the bathroom mirror told him there was no white left in them. As Shinji wept, one thought kept repeating: _All I can do is cry. I'm completely useless._  
泪水再次涌出，他已数不清这是第几次。双眼刺痛，浴室镜中的模糊记忆告诉他，眼白已不复存在。真嗣哭泣时，心中反复回响着一个念头：除了哭泣，我别无他法。我真是毫无用处。

His father's voice, buzzed from the intercom, echoed in his mind.  
他父亲通过对讲机传来的声音，在他心中回荡。

_"Because I have a use for you."  
因为我需要你的帮助。_

_Is this the use you have for me, father? Is this my use? To kill?  
父亲，这就是你对我的期望吗？我的使命就是去杀戮吗？_

A sliver of sensation different from pain emerged in his palm. The minute details of an entry plug being crushed inside of it made him shudder.  
他手掌中浮现出一丝异于疼痛的感觉，插入栓在其内部被碾碎的微妙细节令他感到一阵寒意。

_I held his life in my hands...  
我曾掌握着他的命运..._

The ghost memory clinging to the fading bruises on his neck.  
那些缠绕在他脖颈瘀伤逐渐消退处的幽灵记忆。

_I know what that's like now... and I know what it's like to go over that line... not being able to stop myself...  
我现在深切体会到那种感觉...也明白了越界后的无助...那种无法自控的感受..._

The vivid memory of that sound – the groaning metal, the cracking surface, the screech of the shattering.  
那声音的鲜活记忆——金属的呻吟声，表面的裂开声，以及破碎时的尖锐声响。

_With my own hands... with my own hands...  
亲手...亲手..._

His hand was screaming now, making pain. To Shinji, it was as if this was all his hands were good for, creating pain. He looked at it, at the torn skin hanging from bloody knuckles... the blood was in his palm, marking the lines in white.  
他的手此刻正痛苦地尖叫着。对真嗣而言，似乎他的手唯一能做的就是制造痛苦。他凝视着那只手，血淋淋的指节上挂着撕裂的皮肤……鲜血染红了手掌，白色的掌纹清晰可见。

_There's blood on my hands. My only saving grace is his breath...  
我手上沾满了血迹。我唯一的救赎之光，是他微弱的呼吸……_

His stomach churned. Shinji barely kept the bile down as he stood up and rushed out of his room. He turned and barged into the bathroom, barely registering a high-pitched sound before puking his guts out. Dry heaving on his knees, Shinji found that his head was vibrating. It wasn't a headache, not a bit, it was rather this feeling of a hand inside his skull, squeezing its fingers, putting pressure on his brain.  
他的胃一阵翻腾。真嗣强忍着呕吐的冲动，站起身冲出房间。他转身闯入浴室，几乎没注意到一声尖锐的声响，就开始剧烈呕吐。跪在地上干呕时，真嗣感觉到自己的头部在震动。这并非头痛，丝毫不是，而是一种仿佛有手在颅内挤压手指，对大脑施加压力的异样感觉。

_I can't... I can't... 我做不到...我做不到..._

Asuka carefully adjusted herself in the tub, her every move calculated and precise. She studied him as he slowly pushed himself back up to stand on shaky legs. He bent down to recover the first aid kit from under the sink. He pulled out the tools necessary as best as he could with one hand: antiseptic, cotton, bandages, and scissors. She was frozen in the water, silent as the walls around them, watching him patch himself up. He did a piss-poor job of it, had parts of his pants bleached with stray droplets by overdoing the antiseptic... but he wrapped his fingers rather skillfully, and extended the bandages to his wrist. Asuka realized that he was copying Misato.  
明日香在浴缸中小心翼翼地调整姿势，每一个动作都经过深思熟虑且精准到位。她注视着他，见他缓缓地用颤抖的双腿重新站稳。他弯腰从洗手台下取出急救包，用一只手尽可能好地拿出所需物品：消毒剂、棉球、绷带和剪刀。她僵在水里，四周静谧无声，目不转睛地看着他为自己包扎。虽然他的包扎手法粗糙，裤子上有些部分被消毒剂的溅滴弄得褪色了……但他缠绕手指的动作颇为熟练，还将绷带延伸至手腕。明日香意识到他是在模仿美里。

Asuka saw him stumbling to regain composure, trying to reel himself back in. He placed the surplus materials back in the box, threw away the bloodied wads of cotton. He looked at himself in the mirror, wiped away his tears.  
明日香注意到他正努力稳住情绪，试图让自己重新冷静下来。他将多余的材料放回箱中，丢弃了沾满血迹的棉花。他对着镜子审视自己，拭去了脸上的泪水。

"I got into a fight." He said, and for a moment, Asuka thought he had noticed her in the bath. When he paused, she knew that he hadn't. "I won." His Adam's apple strained as he swallowed hard, "I nearly killed him. Nearly... killed him."
