March 2027 2027 年 3 月

With barely a sound the balcony door slid open and a man stepped through, carrying a mug in his hand. He crossed the narrow strip of metal and concrete to lean against the railing. Raising one hand, he partially blocked the sun being reflected by the building across the street. Blue eyes narrowed as he briefly smiled, watching the sun continue to rise. Sounds of traffic and pedestrians reached his level but he paid no attention to it. Like all living things, humans had survived the challenge of the Angels and gone on to rebuild the shattered city of Tokyo-3. Things should have been good for the man, but they weren't.  
阳台门几乎无声地滑开，一名男子手持杯子走了进来。他穿过狭窄的金属与混凝土地带，倚靠在栏杆上。举起一只手，他部分遮挡了对面建筑反射的阳光。蓝眼睛微微眯起，他短暂地微笑着，注视着太阳继续升起。交通和行人的声音传到了他的高度，但他并未在意。像所有生物一样，人类已经克服了天使的挑战，并重建了破碎的第三新东京市。对这位男子来说，本应一切安好，但实际上并非如此。

Sighing, he finished the last of his morning coffee and strode back into the apartment. Walking over to the answering machine, he stared down at the blinking red light with apprehension. The man knew what to expect when the button was pushed to replay the recording. After all, he had walked in the night before, just as the caller finished her call. It wasn't the first time he had received such a message, but he would never grow used to them. Reaching down, he pushed the button deciding he could let work bury any feelings he had.  
他叹了口气，喝完最后一口早晨的咖啡，大步走回公寓。走向电话答录机，他盯着那闪烁的红灯，心中忐忑。男人知道按下重播键后会听到什么。毕竟，昨晚他刚进门，就听到对方挂断电话的声音。这不是他第一次收到这样的留言，但他永远无法习惯。他伸手按下按钮，决定让工作埋葬自己的所有情感。

"Hello, Shinji. It's me, Kei. There's no good way to say what I'm going to tell you, so here it is. These last six months have been fun, we've done a lot of exciting things together but I can't see you anymore. I'm getting older and want to start thinking of settling down, but each time I bring up that subject you go all distant on me. I don't know what makes you afraid of commitment. I've tried to be patient and let you talk about your past but you never did." The woman's voice paused. "I loved you, Shinji, I truly did. I'm sorry. Good bye."  
“你好，真嗣。是我，惠。我不知道该怎么开口，但事实就是这样。过去的六个月很快乐，我们一起经历了很多激动人心的事情，但我不能再和你见面了。我年纪渐长，想要开始考虑安定下来，但每次我提起这个话题，你就变得疏远。我不知道是什么让你害怕承诺。我试图耐心等待，让你谈论过去，但你从未开口。”女人的声音停顿了一下。“我爱你，真嗣，真的。对不起。再见。”

When the message ended with a beep, Shinji stood there calmly, showing no reaction to the woman's words. His finger reached down and pushed the erase button, and he wondered if it was normal to feel empty after getting dumped. Squeezing his eyes shut, he felt the beginnings of tears but forced himself not to cry. He had learned that lesson well over the years, to hide his emotions. Taking a deep breath, he slowly released it while opening his eyes just as the message was deleted.  
当信息以一声哔结束时，真嗣平静地站在那里，对那位女士的话毫无反应。他的手指伸下去按下了删除键，他不禁思索，被甩后感到空虚是否正常。他紧闭双眼，感觉到泪水即将涌出，却强迫自己不要哭泣。多年来，他早已学会隐藏自己的情感。深吸一口气后，他缓缓呼出，同时睁开眼睛，就在这时，信息被删除了。

"Like it never existed," he muttered. "Didn't even get the face-to-face break-up like last time."  
就像它从未存在过一样，"他喃喃自语。"甚至没有像上次那样面对面的分手。

He walked away from the small table and down the hall to his bedroom. He passed the kitchen without a glance, knowing his stomach wouldn't be able to handle the food as it was tied in knots. Opening his closet, he passed over the various jeans and polo shirts to pull out his normal office clothes, a black suit and white shirt. Dressing quickly, he paused in front of the mirror for a fast glance before grabbing the leather jacket next to the door. Turning, he gave the apartment one last glance wondering if it would ever echo with laughter again. The door closed with a hiss and he made his way to the garage and his car.  
他离开小桌，穿过走廊回到卧室。经过厨房时未曾侧目，心知肚明此刻胃里纠结如麻，无法承受任何食物。打开衣橱，他略过各式牛仔裤和 polo 衫，取出平日上班的装束——一套黑色西装与白衬衫。迅速更衣后，他在镜前匆匆一瞥，随即抓起门旁的皮夹克。转身之际，他最后一次环视公寓，思索着这里是否还会再次回荡起欢声笑语。门轻轻关上，他走向车库，启动了自己的车。

The computer screen went blank without a sound, and Shinji leaned back in his chair. He covered his mouth as he yawned before stretching as much as the chair allowed. His back audibly popped, causing hium to wince at the sound. The clock on the desk told him he had been busy for the last five hours without a break. Standing, he rubbed his stomach as it growled, reminding him that he had not eaten since the night before. Walking over to the small fridge that had been installed a while back, he grabbed a sandwich and a bottle of water. As he ate he walked around his office, clearing his mind and stretching his legs.  
电脑屏幕无声无息地变黑，真嗣靠在椅背上。他捂着嘴打了个哈欠，随后尽可能地在椅子允许的范围内伸展身体。背部发出响亮的咔嚓声，让他不禁皱眉。桌上的时钟告诉他，他已经连续忙碌了五个小时没有休息。站起身，他揉了揉咕咕叫的肚子，提醒自己从昨晚起就没吃过东西。他走向不久前安装的小冰箱，拿出一盒三明治和一瓶水。边吃边在办公室里踱步，清理思绪，舒展双腿。

He stopped and stared at the one wall that was not filled with bookcases or computer equipment. Faces of long ago stared back at him in full color. College friends had places next to old high school buddies. But the majority of the pictures were from the time of Angels and immediately afterwards. Rei, Misato, and Asuka had the most pictures, though Asuka was scowling in a lot of them. Still there were a few where she was smiling and his eyes softened at them. That was until he reached the picture taken at the airport eight years ago as she left, then he felt empty. A knock at the door caused him to turn from the wall and his fading memories of those years.  
他停下脚步，凝视着那面未被书架或电脑设备占据的墙壁。往昔的面孔以全彩形式回望着他。大学时代的朋友与旧日高中伙伴并排而立。但大多数照片都来自天使时代及其后不久。其中，绫波、美里和明日香的照片最多，尽管明日香在很多照片中都皱着眉头。不过，也有几张她笑得灿烂，他的目光在这些照片上变得柔和。直到他看到八年前她在机场离开时拍的那张照片，心中顿感空虚。此时，敲门声响起，让他从那面墙前转过身来，那些年的记忆也随之渐渐消散。

A petite young lady of European descent stepped through the door. She smiled faintly as she saw him standing at the wall of photographs. In one hand, she clutched a folder with red markings, denoting a project that hadn't been green-lighted within the corporation. Sitting in a chair, the woman waited for him to take a seat before handing the folder over. Shinji found himself glancing up at the woman as he read through the report. He had found himself liking her from the first day; she was smart, fun and good looking but just a friend. His job was stressful enough without the added complication of a relationship with one of his co-workers, and someone he respected.  
一位娇小的欧裔年轻女子推门而入。她看到他站在照片墙前，微微一笑。她一手紧握着一个带有红色标记的文件夹，标志着这个项目尚未在公司内部获得批准。女子坐在椅子上，等他坐下后才递过文件夹。真嗣在阅读报告时，不禁抬头看向这位女士。他从第一天起就对她颇有好感；她聪明、有趣且长相出众，但仅仅是朋友。他的工作压力已经够大，无需再添上与同事、尤其是他尊敬的人之间的恋爱纠葛。

"It looks like the old men still haven't come to their senses," she commented, brushing brown hair off a slender shoulder.  
“看来那些老家伙还是没清醒过来，”她评论道，轻拂棕色秀发，露出纤细的肩膀。

"Angela, you know how difficult it is to get funding for a project this risky," he said, calmly. "The Belgians started this earlier in the century…"  
“安吉拉，你也知道为这种高风险项目争取资金有多难，”他平静地说，“比利时人在上个世纪初就开始了……”

"But Second Impact stopped it before they got any firm data. I know that already," she interrupted.  
"但第二次冲击在他们获得任何确切数据之前就发生了。这个我已经知道了，" 她打断道。

"Sorry." “对不起。”

She waved her hand. "Don't worry about it. Anyways, I've got more bad news. The supervisor on the test derricks wants to see you as soon as possible. Something about programming errors and transfer rates."  
她挥了挥手。"别担心这个。不管怎样，我还有更坏的消息。测试钻井平台的监督员想尽快见你。关于编程错误和传输速率的问题。"

"Okay," Shinji said, opening his scheduler. "I can see him…"  
"好的，" 真嗣说着，打开了日程表。"我可以见他……"

"I've already rescheduled the rest of the day."  
"我已经重新安排了今天剩下的时间。"

The young man nodded his appreciation. "Thanks. I don't know what'd I do without you."  
年轻人点头表示感谢。"谢谢。没有你我真不知道该怎么办。"

Angela stood at the sametime as Shinji. "Probably get swamped with work."  
安吉拉与真嗣同时站起来。"大概会被工作淹没吧。"

He smiled at the comment knowing that it would more than likely be true. Once he started on one thing he ignored everything else, which led to paperwork building up. Shinji grabbed his jacket off of his chair, sliding the file into his briefcase before striding to the door. He stopped as Angela had not left before him and was waiting for him. She wore a small smile as she stared at him with green eyes."  
他对着那条评论笑了笑，心里明白这多半是真的。一旦他开始专注于某件事，就会忽略其他所有事情，导致文件堆积如山。真嗣从椅背上抓起外套，将文件滑入公文包，然后大步走向门口。他停下脚步，因为安吉拉还没离开，正在等他。她带着淡淡的微笑，用那双绿色的眼睛凝视着他。

"I've been wondering," she said, blushing. "If you'd join me for a drink one of these nights…between friends."  
我一直很好奇，" 她说着，脸颊泛起红晕，"你愿不愿意找个晚上，跟我一起去喝一杯……就当是朋友间的聚会。

"I'm sorry, but I just can't," he found himself saying.  
"对不起，但我真的做不到，" 他发现自己脱口而出。

Disappointment showed for brief second before she smiled. "…Okay."  
失望在她的脸上闪现了一瞬，随即她微笑道。"…好吧。

With that, the two adults left his office and went their own ways. Angela returned to her cubicle to catch up on the project and answer the phone while he was out of the office. Shinji went to the bank of the elevators that would lead to the parking deck. He didn't realize he was frowning until the doors closed and he could see himself on their highly polished surfaces. The frown grew at how cold he must have seemed to the woman after turning down a simple request, but he reminded himself of what had happened that morning. When the doors opened to the cool air of the garage his face was blank.  
就这样，两位成年人离开了他的办公室，各自分道扬镳。安吉拉回到自己的隔间，赶忙处理项目并接听电话，而他则不在办公室。真嗣走向电梯间，那里通向停车场。直到电梯门关闭，他才从那光亮的门面上意识到自己皱着眉头。他对自己拒绝一个简单请求后显得多么冷漠感到不满，但他提醒自己早上发生的事情。当电梯门打开，迎面而来的是车库的凉爽空气，他的表情已变得毫无波澜。

The door opened into the darkened apartment and Shinji kicked off his shoes before he went past the foyer. He flicked the light switch on, blinking at the sudden illumination, before continuing to the living room. After a few minutes of searching for the remote, he turned the television on, flipping to a financial channel. Grunting at what he saw the man turned from the news, wanting to get something to eat and drink. He stopped as he saw the blinking red light of a message on his machine.  
门一开，真嗣便踏入了昏暗的公寓，他踢掉鞋子，穿过门厅。他打开灯，因突如其来的光线而眨了眨眼，随后继续走向客厅。花了好几分钟寻找遥控器后，他打开了电视，切换到财经频道。看到新闻内容，他不满地哼了一声，转而想去弄点吃的喝的。就在这时，他注意到自己的留言机上闪烁着红色指示灯。

"Didn't I…" Shinji muttered before shaking his head.  
"我不是……" 真嗣喃喃自语，随后摇了摇头。

His kitchen was clean and orderly with no dishes in the sink or rubbish on the counters. Opening the fridge, he grabbed a bottle of water and a container of leftovers. Not bothering to heat the food up, he grabbed a fork and went back out to the living room. Sitting on the couch, Shinji propped his feet up on the coffee table and opened the water. With little enthusiasm, he jabbed the fork into the spaghetti, twirling it around the tines. As the latest stock quotes flowed across the screen, he alternated between eating and drinking, finishing his meal in a matter of minutes. Sighing, he took the containers into the kitchen, pushing the message button after grabbing the cordless phone.  
他的厨房干净整洁，水槽里没有碗碟，台面上也没有垃圾。打开冰箱，他拿出一瓶水和一盒剩菜。懒得加热食物，他抓起一把叉子回到客厅。坐在沙发上，真嗣把脚搁在咖啡桌上，打开水瓶。他没什么兴致地用叉子戳进意大利面，绕着叉齿旋转。当最新的股票报价在屏幕上滚动时，他交替着吃东西和喝水，几分钟就吃完了饭。叹了口气，他把容器拿进厨房，抓起无绳电话后按下了留言按钮。

"Shinji, this Hikari. Give me a call, preferably tonight. Bye."  
"真嗣，我是光。给我回个电话，最好是今晚。再见。"

The message was over before he had even returned to the couch. With remote in hand he flipped through the channels, mulling over whether he should call, since it was late in the evening. A push of the button and the television was turned off, the remote placed on the coffee table. Shinji sat there staring at his phone wondering what Hikari wanted to talk about. Without even thinking, his thumb was pushing the appropriate numbers before he had made up his mind to call. Sighing, he lifted the phone to his ear, hearing Hikari's phone ringing.  
消息还没等他回到沙发上就已经结束了。手里拿着遥控器，他翻看着频道，思索着是否应该打电话，毕竟已是晚上。按下按钮，电视机关闭，遥控器放在茶几上。真嗣坐在那里，盯着手机，琢磨着光想谈些什么。还没等他下定决心，拇指就已经按下了相应的号码。叹了口气，他把手机举到耳边，听到光的电话铃声响起。

"Suzuhara residence," a girl answered after four rings.  
“铃原家。”四声铃响后，一个女孩接了电话。

"Is Hikari there?" “光在吗？”

"May I ask who is calling?" the girl asked.  
"请问是哪位？" 女孩问道。

"It's Shinji Ikari," he smiled faintly. "I can't believe you don't recognize my voice, Ruriko."  
"我是碇真嗣，" 他微微一笑，"没想到你竟然听不出我的声音，琉璃子。"

"Shinji!" Ruriko squealed in delight. "When are you coming over again? It's been boring having to play with Yuri."  
"真嗣！" 琉璃子兴奋地尖叫，"你什么时候再来啊？和尤里玩真是无聊透了。"

"I'll be over soon, and don't talk about your younger sister like that," he scolded.  
"我很快就到，别那样说你妹妹，"他责备道。

"But she's so boring. All she does is…" Shinji heard Hikari's voice in the background. "Mom's here." A pause. "Please visit soon."  
"但她真的很无聊。她整天就只会……"真嗣听到背后传来光的声音。"妈妈来了。"停顿了一下。"请尽快来访。"

He frowned slightly knowing that he had neglected his friends lately, going all the way back to college. Touji and Hikari had gotten married a year after high school while he buried himself in college and graduating early. Though he visited as much as possible sometimes weeks would go by when he didn't talk to anyone. It seemed like work was his only life.  
他微微皱眉，意识到自己最近疏远了朋友，这种情况可以追溯到大学时期。东治和光在高中毕业一年后结婚了，而他则埋头于大学学业，提前毕业。虽然他尽可能地拜访，但有时几周过去了，他都没有和任何人交谈。工作似乎成了他唯一的生活。

"Shinji, you there?" Hikari's voice sounded worried.  
"真嗣，你在吗？" 明日香的声音听起来有些担忧。

The man shook his head, turning his attention back to the phone. "Sorry, my mind drifted."  
男子摇了摇头，将注意力转回到电话上。"抱歉，我走神了。"

"Better take care of it before it gets worse." He could hear the smile on Hikari's face. "How have you been, Shinji?"  
"最好在情况恶化之前处理好它。" 他可以听出明日香脸上的微笑。"你最近怎么样，真嗣？"

"Okay, I guess. I've seen better days and worse days before."  
"还行吧。我经历过更好的日子，也经历过更糟的。"

"Everything okay between you and Kei?"  
"你和 Kei 之间还好吗？"

"Yeah," he lied. "So what'd you want to talk about?"  
"嗯，" 他撒了个谎。"你想聊什么？"

"The class reunion. It's this weekend and I wanted to make sure you were going to be there."  
"同学聚会。这个周末就要举行了，我想确认一下你会不会去。"

"Already?" "这么快？"

Hikari sighed. "I thought you'd be excited. After all you left early at the last one and…"  
光叹了口气。“我以为你会很兴奋。毕竟上次你提前离开了，而且……”

"Well not much changes in four years," he interrupted.  
"嗯，四年了，也没什么变化，" 他打断道。

"That's not true!" She sounded shocked. "Lots of things have changed."  
"那不是真的！" 她听起来很震惊。"很多事情都变了。"

The man closed his eyes, remembering the reunion four years ago. Nothing had changed back then, four years after they had graduated. The married couples were still married; the singles still single. All that had changed was who had gotten promoted at their jobs or what new possession they had just bought. He had left early back then, tired of listening to people talk about their children or girlfriends.  
男人闭上眼睛，回忆起四年前的那次重聚。那时候，毕业四年了，一切似乎都未曾改变。已婚的依旧婚姻美满；单身的仍旧形单影只。唯一的变化不过是工作上的晋升，或是新添置的财物。那时他早早离场，厌倦了听人们谈论他们的孩子或女友。

"Have you talked to…Asuka?" he asked, hesitantly.  
"你和...明日香谈过了吗？" 他迟疑地问道。

"No." Hikari paused. When she spoke again her voice was sad. "I guess she's keeping her word of never returning to Japan again."  
"没有。" 光停顿了一下，再次开口时声音带着悲伤，"我想她是在遵守不再回日本的承诺。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Look the reason I called wasn't to make you feel guilty," the woman's voice had regained its cheerfulness. "I haven't been able to get a hold of Rei, and Miss Katsuragi isn't returning my calls. Can you tell Rei about the reunion?"  
"听着，我打电话来不是为了让你感到内疚，" 女子的声音恢复了往日的欢快，"我一直联系不上绫波，葛城小姐也不回我电话。你能告诉绫波关于重聚的事吗？"

"I'll make sure she gets the message," he replied quietly.  
"我会确保她收到消息的，"他轻声回答道。

"And show up! There's more to life than just work."  
"而且要出现！生活中不只有工作。"

"I'll be there, Hikari. I promise," Shinji stated ignoring her last comment.  
"我会去的，Hikari。我保证，"Shinji 说道，忽略了她的最后一句话。

"Hold the elevator!" "等等电梯！"

Shinji stuck his arm through the opened doors when he heard the voice call out. The workday had passed slowly and he had a large headache from not sleeping. It always seemed that whenever he talked to friends from school, especially Hikari, he was never able to sleep. He had spent the night before staring up at the ceiling reliving all his failures, whether professional or personal. The man remembered reading somewhere that burying your inner demons only made them worse, yet nothing changed with his demons. If he buried them, they ate at his insides and if he acknowledged them they still bothered him.  
听到声音呼唤时，真嗣将手臂伸进了即将关闭的电梯门。工作日过得异常缓慢，由于睡眠不足，他感到剧烈的头痛。每当他与学校的朋友们交谈，尤其是与光，他总是难以入睡。前一晚，他躺在床上凝视着天花板，反复回忆起自己所有的失败，无论是职业上的还是个人的。他记得曾在某处读到，埋藏内心的恶魔只会让它们变得更糟，但他的恶魔却没有任何改变。如果他埋藏它们，它们会侵蚀他的内心；如果他承认它们，它们仍然会困扰他。

"Damned if you do. Damned if you don't," he muttered.  
"做也错，不做也错，"他喃喃自语。

"Did you say something, Shinji?"  
"你说什么了吗，真嗣？"

The man blinked and saw Angela standing next to him a worried expression on her face. Sheepishly, he lowered his arm and pressed the button for the underground parking garage. When the doors closed he could see just how tired he was as his entire body seemed to be sagging. The only good part was that he didn't have circles under his eyes.  
男子眨了眨眼，看到安吉拉站在他旁边，脸上带着担忧的表情。他尴尬地放下手臂，按下了通往地下停车场的按钮。当门关上时，他才意识到自己有多疲惫，整个身体似乎都在下垂。唯一值得庆幸的是，他的眼睛下面没有黑眼圈。

"Nothing, just talking to myself," he answered when the elevator started down.  
"没什么，只是自言自语而已，"电梯开始下行时他回答道。

"Is something wrong?" she asked, concern in her voice. "You haven't been…yourself all day."  
"有什么不对劲吗？" 她关切地问道，"你今天一整天都不太像你自己。"

He opened his mouth to deny that he had been acting weird but closed it at her expression.  
他张开嘴想要否认自己行为古怪，但看到她的表情后又闭上了。

'Why do women always make me feel…' He thought before answering. "Just thinking of my class reunion in a couple days."  
'为什么女人总是让我感觉……' 他想着，然后回答道："只是想着过几天要参加的同学聚会。"

"Things like that will always get a person thinking, though mine was fun," she replied, sighing. "I just wish I was still in the United States. It'd make it easier to go to my next one." The woman perked up, smiling. "So you want to go get that drink tonight? I can tell you about my reunion and you can tell me about yours."  
"那种事情总会让人思绪万千，不过我的挺有趣的，" 她叹了口气回答道，"真希望我还在美国，那样去参加下一次聚会就方便多了。" 女子精神一振，微笑着说："那今晚要不要去喝一杯？我可以跟你聊聊我的聚会，你也可以说说你的。

"Sorry," he said sincerely. "I've got to meet an old friend tonight."  
"抱歉，" 他真诚地说，"今晚我得见一个老朋友。

"So who is she?" "那她是谁呢？"

Shinji winced, wondering if he was that easy to read. "Misato Katsuragi, a United Nations officer and my former guardian."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，怀疑自己是否真的那么容易被人看穿。“葛城美里，联合国官员，也是我曾经的监护人。”

"She must be special to you?" She frowned when he nodded.  
“她对你一定很特别吧？”她皱眉问道，而他点头确认。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Those words continued to bounce around the inside of his mind as he pulled his dark green BMW sedan next to Misato's new blue Renault sports car. The older woman was special to him for a lot of reasons, some of which would surprise a lot of people. She had been a lot of things to him since he had met her so many years ago: guardian, friend, an older sister, drinking buddy, a stern mother, and a confidant. All of those described the various sides of his relationship with Misato. As he pushed through the doors of the restaurant he saw her standing at the hostess station, chatting with the young woman manning it.  
这些话在他脑海中回荡，当他将自己的深绿色宝马轿车停在美里新买的蓝色雷诺跑车旁时。这位年长的女性对他来说意义非凡，其中一些原因可能会让很多人感到惊讶。自从多年前遇见她以来，她对他来说扮演了多种角色：监护人、朋友、姐姐、酒友、严厉的母亲和知己。这些都描述了他与美里关系的不同侧面。当他推开餐厅的门时，看到她正站在迎宾台旁，与负责接待的年轻女子交谈着。

"Leave the poor girl alone, Misato," he said, jokingly.  
"别再逗那可怜的女孩了，碇，" 他开玩笑地说道。

The violet haired woman turned around at his voice. Though he had gone home to change and shower, he still felt like a little boy as she ran a critical eye over him. Her stern demeanor disappeared when she grinned at him and smothered him in a hug. It was his turn to look disapprovingly at his friend and what she was wearing. For someone in her early forties she still dressed like a woman in her twenties. The strapless yellow dress she wore barely reached her knees and as they passed various tables men still gawked at her. He smiled faintly as he waited for her to be seated before sitting down across from her. Neither spoke as they briefly glanced at their menus, already knowing what they were going to order, which was evident when they signaled for a waiter minutes later.  
紫发女子听到他的声音转过身来。尽管他已经回家换了衣服并洗了澡，但在她挑剔的目光下，他仍觉得自己像个小孩。她严肃的表情在对他咧嘴一笑并紧紧拥抱他时消失了。轮到他不满地看着他的朋友和她所穿的服装。尽管她才四十出头，却仍打扮得像个二十多岁的女人。她穿的黄色无肩带裙子几乎遮不住膝盖，当他们经过各个桌子时，男人们仍然目不转睛地盯着她。他微微一笑，等她坐下后才在她对面坐下。两人都只是简短地扫了一眼菜单，显然已经知道自己要点什么，几分钟后他们便示意服务员过来。

Misato rested her chin on one palm quietly studying the young man sitting across from her. She had to agree with many a female colleague that Shinji had matured into a handsome young man, taller than most men, with the clean hard lines of his father. The young man's eyes softened the stern look of his father, the only physical trait he had inherited from his mother. Or that was all she had been able to find. The woman sighed slightly as she recognized the signs of Shinji trying to figure out the right way to start the conversation. And by the way he didn't acknowledge the waiter when he returned with their salads, it must be serious. Frowning, she picked at her salad after the waiter had left them, waiting for Shinji to speak, watching as he played with his food.  
碇真嗣静静地坐在对面，三佐用手撑着下巴，默默地观察着他。她不得不承认，许多女同事都有同感，真嗣已经长成了一个英俊的年轻人，比大多数男性都要高，继承了他父亲干净利落的线条。年轻人的眼神柔和了他父亲的严厉，这是他唯一从母亲那里继承的生理特征。或者说，这是她所能发现的全部。女人轻轻叹了口气，意识到真嗣正在试图找到开启对话的正确方式。而从他对服务员端来沙拉时不予理睬的态度来看，事情一定很严重。服务员离开后，她皱着眉头拨弄着自己的沙拉，等待真嗣开口，看着他摆弄着食物。

"So how's work?" the woman finally asked, smiling at his frown. "Boring as usual?"  
“工作怎么样？”女人终于问道，对着他的皱眉微笑。“还是一如既往的无聊吗？”

"Yeah, the executives are still dragging their feet on my project."  
“是啊，高管们对我的项目还是拖拖拉拉的。”

Her grin grew. "That's the way it is everywhere, Shinji. The older one becomes the more cautious one gets." She took a sip of water. "It's especially true of businessmen."  
她的笑容更甚。“这就是到处都一样的道理，真嗣。人越老，就越谨慎。”她喝了一口水。“尤其是商人。”

Shinji sighed. "I know all of that, Misato. And knowing it doesn't make it any easier to handle." He took a bite of the salad, frowning at having chosen the wrong dressing. Looking up, he saw his former guardian studying him. "What?"  
真嗣叹了口气。“这些我都知道，美里。知道这些并不会让处理起来更容易。”他咬了一口沙拉，因为选错了调料而皱眉。抬头一看，他发现他的前监护人正在审视他。“怎么了？”

"I really should talk to Kei about feeding you properly," she joked. "You're too thin."  
“我真的应该和圭谈谈，让他好好喂你，”她开玩笑说，“你太瘦了。”

"I'm not!" the man protested.  
"我不是！" 男人抗议道。

"So when was the last time she cooked for you?"  
"那她上次给你做饭是什么时候？"

"A week ago." "一周前。"

Normally that answer would've satisfied the older woman's curiosity, but something about his tone of voice worried her. She studied him for a few quiet moments noticing how he wouldn't meet her eyes and how his right hand twitched. Not only that, his entire body had tensed at his girlfriend's name. Leaning back, she brought a glass of water up to her lips, seeing his shoulders relax at the simple distraction. Setting her drink down, Misato picked up her fork and started eating again.  
通常这样的回答会满足那位年长女性的好奇心，但他的语气中有些东西让她感到不安。她静静地观察了他一会儿，注意到他不敢直视她的眼睛，以及他的右手不时抽搐。不仅如此，一提到他女朋友的名字，他的整个身体都绷紧了。她向后靠去，端起一杯水送到唇边，看到这个简单的动作让他的肩膀放松了下来。放下杯子，葛城美里拿起叉子，继续吃饭。

"When did you break up with her?" This time she saw him jump.  
你什么时候和她分手的？"这次她看到他明显一惊。

Shinji was caught off guard by the sudden shift. "What makes you think I broke up with Kei?"  
真嗣被这突如其来的转变弄得措手不及。"你怎么会认为我和圭分手了？"

"I know you, Shinji. And because you're dodging the question." Misato sighed, "When did you break up with Kei?"  
"我了解你，真嗣。正因为你在回避这个问题。" 美里叹了口气，"你和绫是什么时候分手的？"

"Two days ago," he admitted, knowing it was futile to lie to his friend; she wouldn't believe what he told her.  
"两天前，" 他承认道，知道对朋友撒谎是徒劳的；她不会相信他所说的。

"There go my chances of ever seeing grandchildren," she moaned. "I really had hopes for Kei and you. And the way Asuka is I'll never…"  
"看来我这辈子是看不到孙子孙女了，" 她哀叹道，"我真的很看好你和绫。至于明日香，我更是……"

"You've talked to Asuka!" Shinji felt excited, wanting to hear about his former roommate.  
"你和明日香聊过了！" 真嗣感到兴奋，渴望听到关于他前室友的消息。

"So why did you ask me out?" She asked. "I know it isn't about your breakup, they never seem to affect you in any way."  
"那你为什么约我出来？" 她问道。"我知道这和你分手无关，那些事似乎从不会影响你。"

Shinji sat down, disappointed at her ignoring his question. "Can't I ask a friend out every now and then?"  
真嗣坐下，对她无视自己的问题感到失望。"难道我就不能偶尔约朋友出来吗？"

"Yes, but you only ask me out when you need an ear," she explained. Misato quickly went on at his frown. "I don't mind. It's just that I hardly ever see you except for these little dates, Shinji. I thought we were closer than that."  
"是的，但你只有在需要倾听时才约我出来，"她解释道。看到他皱眉，Misato 迅速继续说："我不介意。只是除了这些小约会，我几乎见不到你，Shinji。我以为我们比这更亲近。"

"Sorry, I should keep in touch more." He blushed, as she waved her hand, telling him it wasn't that big of a deal. Sighing, Shinji closed his eyes. "Sunday is the class reunion. I promised Hikari that I'd be there and…"  
"抱歉，我应该更常联系的。"他脸红地说，而她挥了挥手，表示这没什么大不了的。Shinji 叹了口气，闭上眼睛。"周日是班级聚会。我答应了 Hikari 会去的，而且……"

"And you never break a promise," the woman finished.  
"而且你从不食言，"女人接话道。

"Yeah," he agreed. "But I've never liked class reunions."  
"嗯，" 他同意道。"但我从不喜欢同学聚会。"

Misato frowned faintly. This was the first time she had heard this from the man. "Why not? All your friends will be at the reunion. I know you and Touji are close, that you get together with his family every now and then. Hikari has always been a friend, even if it was through Touji or Asuka; she still cares about you. And no matter what happens, Kensuke will always be your friend. You were a hero to him and others during the Angels." She smiled at the thought of Shinji being portrayed as hero back then. "Besides everyone treats you as a normal person and that's what you want, right?"  
葛城美里微微皱眉。这是她第一次从这个人那里听到这样的话。"为什么不喜欢？你的所有朋友都会在聚会上。我知道你和东治很亲近，偶尔还会和他的家人聚聚。光虽然可能是通过东治或明日香才成为朋友，但她一直关心你。无论发生什么，健介永远都是你的朋友。你对他和其他人来说，曾是抗击使徒的英雄。" 想到那时真嗣被描绘成英雄，她微笑了。"而且大家都把你当作普通人对待，这不正是你想要的吗？"

"I know that, Misato!" He looked over her shoulder, distant. "There are just too many memories wrapped up with that group, though. Whenever I think about the past, all I see are my failures. Everyone has gone through so much, yet I feel like an outsider at times."  
"我知道，葛城！" 他越过她的肩膀望向远方。"只是和那群人有关的记忆太多了。每当我回想过去，看到的都是我的失败。每个人都经历了那么多，而我有时却感觉像个局外人。"

Misato averted her eyes, not wanting to see the pain on Shinji's face. "Rei's supposed to show up." She didn't stop at the lack of reaction. "I'm sure you two can find something to talk about. Out of everyone you know you keep in touch with Rei more than anyone else." Misato frowned again. "You do keep in touch with her don't you?"  
碇真嗣别过头去，不想看到真嗣脸上的痛苦。“绫波应该会来的。”她没有因为缺乏反应而停下。“我相信你们俩总能找到话题。在你认识的人中，你和绫波保持联系比任何人都多。”碇真嗣再次皱眉。“你确实和她保持联系，对吧？”

"Yeah, and we really don't have as much to talk about as you think we do." Shinji poked at the dish in front of him, eating just because he had to and not enjoying the food.  
“是啊，但我们真的没有你想象的那么多话题可聊。”真嗣戳了戳面前的盘子，只是因为必须吃而吃，并不享受食物。

Misato set her knife and fork down, and picked up the glass of wine. Holding it in both hands she swirled it around, watching the red liquid catch and reflect the light. Her voice was soft and sad as she spoke,  
碇真嗣放下刀叉，拿起酒杯。她双手握着杯子，轻轻摇晃，看着红色的液体捕捉并反射光线。她的声音柔和而悲伤，说道，

"I really don't think Asuka is going to show up, Shinji."  
"我真的觉得明日香不会来了，真嗣。"

"Again, I know that, Misato. In the eight years since she left I've never received a phone call or email from her." His voice was sad, resigned to a fact. "I stopped hoping for a card on my birthday or holidays years ago. She's never written a letter explaining anything."  
"我知道，美里。自从她八年前离开后，我从未接到过她的电话或邮件。" 他的声音带着悲伤，对这一事实已经认命。"我多年前就不再期待生日或节日能收到她的卡片了。她从未写过一封信来解释任何事情。"

"So you've gotten over her?"  
"那你已经放下她了吗？"

The man shook his head. "I don't think I'll ever get over her, but…I don't think about her as much as before. She was one of the most unique people I had ever met." He squeezed his eyes shut, stopping his tears. "What's sad is I'm holding onto a memory that's slowly fading away. I don't remember her voice and only have pictures from eight years ago." His eyes were sad, but clear when he opened them. "Is it just as painful for you? Trying to remember Ryoji."  
那人摇了摇头。“我觉得我永远忘不了她，但是……我不再像以前那样频繁地想起她了。她是我遇到过的最独特的人之一。”他紧闭双眼，止住了泪水。“可悲的是，我紧抓着一个正在慢慢消逝的记忆。我不记得她的声音了，只有八年前的一些照片。”当他睁开眼睛时，眼神虽然悲伤，却很清澈。“对你来说，试图回忆起 Ryoji，是不是也同样痛苦？”

"Yes," came the strangled reply.  
“是的，”回答声带着哽咽。

"I'm sorry, Misato. I didn't mean…"  
“对不起，Misato。我不是故意……”

She reached for his hand. "It's all right. I know you weren't trying to hurt me. But yes it hurts." Her smile was gentle. "It's easier for me to remember him because I loved him and knew him for much longer than you knew Asuka."  
她伸手握住他的手。“没关系，我知道你不是故意要伤害我。但确实很痛。”她的笑容温柔。“我之所以更容易记住他，是因为我爱他，认识他的时间比你认识明日香的时间长得多。”

"Yeah, love," he muttered looking up when Misato squeezed his hand.  
“是啊，爱，”他低声说着，抬头看向当美里紧握他的手时。

"You'll find someone one of these days," she told him, smiling. "All you have to do is be patient."  
“总有一天你会遇到那个人的，”她微笑着告诉他。“你只需要耐心等待。”

"I've been alone my entire life," he stated calmly. "I think I'm one of those people that is destined to be alone forever."  
"我一生都是孤身一人，"他平静地说道，"我想我注定要孤独终老。"

"What would you say to her?" she asked, unable to bear his words anymore. It was just too sad.  
"你会对她说什么？"她问道，再也忍受不了他的话。这实在是太悲伤了。

Shinji looked puzzled. "What?"  
真嗣看起来很困惑。"什么？"

"Asuka. What would you say to her if you saw her again?"  
"明日香。如果你再次见到她，你会对她说什么？"

"Do you know something?" he inquired optimistically, interested in her words.  
"你知道些什么吗？"他满怀希望地询问，对她的言语感到兴趣。

"Hypothetically speaking," she replied. "If she showed up in Tokyo-3 again what would you say to her? What would you ask her, tell her? What questions would you want answered?"  
"假设性地讲，"她回答道，"如果她再次出现在第三新东京市，你会对她说什么？你会问她什么，告诉她什么？你希望得到哪些问题的答案？"

Shinji smiled faintly. "To tell you the truth, I don't know. We never really talked all that much before she left. I hardly know anything about her, so I don't really know where I would start."  
真嗣微微一笑。“说实话，我不知道。在她离开之前，我们并没有太多交流。我对她几乎一无所知，所以真的不知道该从何谈起。”

Misato smiled, remembering how hard it had been to have a conversation with the German girl before she left. Asuka had distanced herself even more from the people around her. Angers and tempers had flared even more as the United Nations inquiries dragged on for almost a year. During that time both teens would fall into silent depression, pulling into their shells only to violently erupt at tense or touchy occasions. The times that they did talk to each other were normally filled with large gaps of silence, as neither knew what to say that wouldn't set the other person off. But the last year had been the worst as their family unit disintegrated, and Misato had never gotten the reason why from either teen.  
美里回想起在那个德国女孩离开前，与她交谈是多么困难。明日香与周围人的距离更远了。随着联合国调查持续了近一年，愤怒和脾气愈发激烈。那段时间里，两个少年都陷入了沉默的抑郁，蜷缩在自己的壳中，只在紧张或敏感的时刻猛烈爆发。他们偶尔交谈时，通常充满了长时间的沉默，因为谁也不知道说什么才不会激怒对方。但过去的一年是最糟糕的，他们的家庭关系破裂了，美里从未从任何一个少年那里得到过原因。

"That's not good enough, Shinji," she told him. "There has to be one thing that you want answered. Something that you want to hear her tell you if you two met again."  
“这还不够，真嗣，”她对他说。“你必须有一个想要得到答案的问题。如果你们再次相遇，你希望听她亲口告诉你什么。”

The man thought about that. "I guess I have a couple questions I want answered."  
那人思索了一下。“我想我有几个问题想要得到解答。”

"What are they?" Misato leaned forward, waiting.  
“什么问题？” 葛城美里倾身向前，等待着。

"I'm sorry, they're for Asuka and only for her."  
“对不起，这些问题是给明日香的，只属于她。”

"Well it's a start, even if it's a hypothetical encounter," commented Misato. She held up a finger, stopping Shinji. "Go to the reunion and catch up with everything that has been happening with your friends. Try talking to some of the single women, and keep your mind off the past."  
"嗯，这至少是个开始，哪怕是假设性的邂逅，" 三佐评论道。她举起一根手指，示意真嗣停下。"去参加聚会，了解一下朋友们最近的情况。试着和一些单身女性交谈，别老想着过去的事。"

"That was cold, Misato." "你这话真冷酷，三佐。"

"It's better that you enjoy yourself than sulk at the party, young man," she countered, grinning widely.  
"年轻人，与其在派对上闷闷不乐，不如让自己开心点，" 她反驳道，咧嘴笑得十分开怀。

Shinji smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "So how come I don't feel young? I feel like I'm fifty instead of just twenty-five."  
真嗣微笑着，但那笑容并未触及眼底。“那为什么我感觉不到年轻呢？我感觉自己像是五十岁，而不是仅仅二十五岁。”

"That's because you keep everything inside instead of talking. You need to find a nice young lady to help you relax."  
那是因为你总是把事情藏在心里，而不是说出来。你需要找一个好姑娘来帮你放松。

Shinji winced at the comment wondering if Misato had completely forgotten what they had just talked about, Asuka and the past. Shaking his head, he knew she hadn't forgotten a single word of what had been just said between the two of them. Instead she was still trying, in a not so subtle way, to tell him to hurry and find someone to love. He didn't have the heart to tell Misato that he had tried to find that special person, but all his attempts had failed for one reason or another. But she was right in that he should go to the reunion.  
听到这话，真嗣皱了皱眉，不知道美里是否完全忘记了他们刚刚关于明日香和过去的谈话。他摇了摇头，知道她并没有忘记他们之间所说的任何一个字。相反，她仍然在不那么微妙地试图告诉他，要快点找到一个爱人。他没有勇气告诉美里，他曾试图找到那个特别的人，但所有的尝试都因这样或那样的原因失败了。但她说的对，他应该去参加那个聚会。

April 2027 2027 年 4 月

Getting out of the taxi, Shinji looked up at the glass and steel building where the reunion was being held. Shaking his head, he paid the driver and slowly walked to the front doors. He watched out of the corner of his eye as groups of people walked by heading to the elevators. The man remembered a few of the people's names but didn't call out, and none of them stopped to inquire who he was. He laughed at that, remembering the times when his face was known around the world because of what he had been. But like all things in life, he had faded out of people's memories, no one on the street remembering who he was.  
下了出租车，真嗣抬头望向那座玻璃与钢铁交织的大楼，那里正举行着重聚活动。他摇了摇头，付了车费，缓缓走向前门。眼角余光中，他看到一群群人走向电梯。他记得其中几个人的名字，但没有呼唤，也没有人停下来询问他是谁。他对此笑了笑，回忆起自己因曾经的身份而闻名世界的时光。但就像生活中的一切，他已从人们的记忆中淡出，街头无人记得他是谁。

"It's better that way," he muttered getting into a nearby elevator.  
“这样更好，”他低声自语，走进了附近的电梯。

"You know it's not good when you talk to yourself, Shinji."  
"你知道和自己说话可不是什么好兆头，真嗣。"

The man spun at the unexpected comment, having been lost in his own thoughts and not noticing the other person. He came face to face with a dark brown haired woman who was shorter than him, and pregnant. She frowned when she saw that he didn't recognize her immediately, instead tapping her foot. Shinji took a moment to study the woman trying to remember if he knew her.  
那人因这突如其来的评论而转身，他原本沉浸在自己的思绪中，并未察觉到其他人的存在。他面前出现了一位深棕色头发的女性，比他矮，且身怀六甲。她看到他一时没认出自己，便皱起了眉头，脚尖轻敲地面。真嗣花了一会儿时间仔细打量这位女士，试图回忆是否认识她。

"Mana?" "真名？"

"That's a start. Now let's see if you can remember my surname."  
"这是一个开始。现在让我们看看你是否能记得我的姓氏。"

Shinji narrowed his eyes, thinking. "Kirishima."  
真嗣眯起眼睛，思考着。“雾岛。”

"Wrong!" She stepped closer to him smiling sadly. "If you had come to the wedding you'd know it."  
"错了！"她微笑着，带着一丝悲伤走近他。"如果你来参加了婚礼，你就会知道。"

"I know, and I'm sorry." With the exception of perhaps Asuka, Shinji had remained somewhat informed in what had been going on in the lives of the people he had met over the years. Mana had been no exception, and that was why he felt bad for telling her he had avoided her wedding. "I've neglected too many…" He stopped when she grabbed his hand, and shook her head. "Mana?"  
"我知道，我很抱歉。" 除了可能的明日香之外，真嗣对这些年遇到的人的生活还是有所了解的。万也不例外，这也是为什么他告诉她自己避开了她的婚礼时感到难过。"我忽略了太多……" 当她抓住他的手并摇头时，他停了下来。"万？"

"Quit feeling guilty, I don't hate you or anything. I just wish you'd keep in touch once in a while. There's nothing wrong with having a girl as a friend. It'd just be like Asuka…" She paused, biting her lower lip at his frown. "Forgive me, I forgot that you and Asuka had a messy break-up."  
"别再自责了，我并不讨厌你或者什么。我只是希望你能偶尔保持联系。有一个女性朋友没什么不对的。就像明日香那样……" 她停顿了一下，看到他皱眉时咬了咬下唇。"原谅我，我忘了你和明日香分手时很糟糕。"

"We never dated," he answered, sadly.  
"我们从未真正交往过，" 他悲伤地回答。

"I'm sorry, I know how much you liked her." She quickly exited when the doors opened, and briefly looked over her shoulder. "You'll find someone."  
"对不起，我知道你有多喜欢她。" 门一开，她就迅速离开了，回头匆匆一瞥。"你会找到别人的。"

'I wish people would stop telling me that,' he thought getting off the elevator.  
他心想：'真希望人们别再这么说了。' 走出电梯。

Walking down the corridor, he followed the sound of music and conversation to the restaurant where Hikari was holding the class reunion. As he passed into the foyer, his face had lost the last traces of sorrow from the elevator. He smiled faintly at the two women signing in people, pinning his name card to his jacket before continuing into the main room. Still smiling he threaded his way through the crowd, trying not to bump into people.  
他沿着走廊走去，循着音乐和谈话声找到了光举办同学会的餐厅。走进门厅时，电梯里残留的悲伤已从他脸上消失。他向两位负责登记的女士微微一笑，将名牌别在夹克上，然后继续步入主厅。他依旧面带微笑，穿梭在人群中，尽量避免碰撞到人。

"Say did you hear about Masami? Supposedly she's…"  
"听说你听说了吗？据说真美她……"

Shinji didn't stop to hear the rest of the conversation; it was all the same, just different people.  
真嗣没有停下来听完对话；都是老一套，只是换了不同的人而已。

"I just got this large bonus for…"  
"我刚因为这个得到了一大笔奖金……"

This time the man sighed, wondering what people would say if they learned how much he made. Money was the only thing in his life he never had to worry about. Spotting who he was looking for, he pushed around a man and his date, ignoring their protests. He knew the woman had done the same to him years ago, not caring that he had been having a conversation. As he neared the trio, the taller man tapped the brunette on the shoulder causing her to turn around. She gave him a quick hug as Touji and Rei watched calmly.  
这次，男人叹了口气，思索着如果人们知道他赚了多少钱会怎么说。金钱是他生活中唯一无需担忧的东西。发现了他正在寻找的人，他推开了一对男女，无视他们的抗议。他记得多年前那个女人也曾这样对他，不在乎他当时正在交谈。当他走近那三人时，较高的男子轻拍了那位棕发女子的肩膀，使她转过身来。她迅速拥抱了他，而东治和丽则平静地看着。

"So you decided to show up," said Hikari in a quiet voice. "But your timing could have been better."  
“你终于决定出现了，”光用平静的声音说道，“但你的时机本可以更好。”

Shinji took a moment to look at the woman standing besides him. Conservative as ever Hikari was wearing a dark green dress of modest cut with a matching short jacket. Her twin pigtails had disappeared back in high school and now the former class representative wore her brown hair just above the shoulder. He wondered how she had gotten so tall, as she had always been shorter, until he saw the heels that she was wearing. Moving slightly, he broke contact between them.  
真嗣花了一会儿时间打量站在他身边的女人。一如既往地保守，光穿着一件深绿色的端庄剪裁连衣裙，搭配同色短外套。她的双马尾早在高中时就消失了，现在这位前班长将她的棕色头发留到了肩膀上方。他好奇她怎么变得这么高，因为她以前总是比较矮，直到他注意到她穿的高跟鞋。他稍微移动了一下，打破了他们之间的接触。

"I told you I'd come, Hikari."  
"我告诉过你我会来的，Hikari。"

"I know," she admitted. "It just feels like you're drifting away, even faster than before."  
"我知道，" 她承认道，"只是感觉你好像离我越来越远，比以前更快了。"

"There's really nothing…" he trailed off not wanting to hurt the woman by saying there was nothing to keep him close. "So who'd you get to baby-sit?"  
"真的没有什么…" 他欲言又止，不想因为说出没有什么能让他留下的话而伤害这位女士。"那么，你找谁来照看孩子了？"

"Kei," Hikari said, blandly. "Why didn't you tell me you two broke up? I worked so hard to get you…"  
"启，"光平淡地说道，"你俩分手了怎么不告诉我？我可是费了好大劲才撮合你们的……"

"Please, can we just drop that subject?" he begged. "I already heard the lecture from Misato, I don't need it from you."  
"求你了，我们能不谈这个话题吗？"他恳求道，"我已经从美里那里听过训话了，不需要再听你的。"

"We're just worried about you," Touji spoke up finally. "In eight years you've had five girlfriends and none of those lasted for even a year." He smiled sadly. "Kensuke might even beat you to the altar."  
"我们只是担心你，" 徹终于开口了，"八年来你交了五个女朋友，没有一个能持续一年以上。"他苦笑道，"说不定健介比你先结婚呢。"

"I know," he groaned before turning to the third person. "What about you, Rei? Do you want to comment on my relationships or lack thereof?"  
"我知道，"他呻吟着，然后转向第三人。"你呢，绫波？你想对我的感情生活或缺乏感情生活发表评论吗？"

The blue-haired woman gave him a small gentle smile and shook her head. Her response was enough to relax Shinji and he felt his temper settling down. He felt himself blush as he looked at the only other girl to capture his heart. She had matured into a beautiful woman and what he had heard from Misato at times was that she had turned down all her admirers, content to live her life alone. As he looked over the slim woman in the blue evening gown he knew the men must have been devastated. She still had perfect white skin and her hair was styled, resting on her shoulders.  
蓝发女子对他微微一笑，摇了摇头。她的回应足以让真嗣放松下来，他感到自己的脾气平息了。当他看着唯一另一个抓住他心的女孩时，他感到自己的脸颊发烫。她已经成熟为一个美丽的女人，他偶尔从美里那里听到的消息是，她拒绝了所有的追求者，满足于独自生活。当他看着那位穿着蓝色晚礼服的苗条女子时，他知道那些男人一定心碎了。她依然拥有完美的白皙肌肤，头发经过精心打理，垂落在肩上。

"Well, I hate to stop here but I really need to get things going," stated Hikari. "Shinji, you and Rei will be at the same table. I have to sit with the other class officers."  
"嗯，我不想就此打住，但我真的需要开始行动了，"光说道。"真嗣，你和绫波将坐在同一张桌子上。我必须和其他班级干部坐在一起。"

With that she smiled and turned around to go to her table, but after a couple of steps she stopped. Looking over her shoulder, the former class representative watched Shinji move away, talking quietly to Rei. She saw the glances he was getting from a few of the single women in the room as he passed them and she could understand. Though she had never met the man, Touji had told her a few times how Shinji took after his father; a tall, dark and mysterious man who no one understood. Yet she knew under that front was a caring young man, all it would take was the right person to get him to open up. She turned at the light touch on her arm to see her husband looking her, worried. Smiling, the brunette moved toward their table.  
就这样，她微笑着转身走向自己的桌子，但走了几步后停了下来。回头望去，这位前任班长看着真嗣离开，正与绫波丽低声交谈。她注意到真嗣经过时，房间里几位单身女性投来的目光，她能理解。虽然她从未见过这个男人，但东治曾几次告诉她，真嗣很像他的父亲；一个高大、深沉且神秘的男人，无人能理解。然而她知道，在那外表之下，是一个充满关怀的年轻人，只需要对的人让他敞开心扉。她感觉到手臂上轻轻的触碰，转头看到丈夫正关切地看着她。微笑着，这位棕发女子向他们的桌子走去。

"So how have you been, Rei?" Shinji asked as they moved deeper into the room.  
“你最近怎么样，绫波？”真嗣问道，他们继续向房间深处走去。

"Good. I have been offered a position at Ms. Ibuki's company if I so desire." She stopped and let a slightly intoxicated classmate go by. "She has been quite insistent that I accept her offer."  
“挺好的。如果我愿意，伊吹小姐的公司给了我一个职位。”她停下脚步，让一位略显醉意的同学先过。“她非常坚持要我接受她的提议。”

"I take it she's been successful? And the same with Ritsuko."  
"我猜她已经成功了？还有，理津子也是。"

"Ms. Akagi has retired from her position in Research and Development. She cited stress as the main cause," the woman said, with a faint smile. "Though I do not believe it."  
"赤木女士已经从研发岗位退休了。她提到压力是主要原因，"女子带着淡淡的微笑说道，"不过我不太相信。"

Shinji pulled out a chair for Rei. "Yeah, Ritsuko lived off of stress so that can't be the reason." He paused, frowning. "My father's first parole hearing is to be in six months."  
真嗣为零拉出一张椅子。"是啊，理津子靠压力生活，所以那不可能是原因。"他停顿了一下，皱起眉头。"我父亲的第一次假释听证会将在六个月后举行。"

"They were lovers in the past. Maybe they want to start over."  
"他们曾是恋人。或许他们想重新开始。"

The man frowned at the thought, picking up his glass and drinking from it to get the bad taste out of his mouth. As he drank, his eyes were glancing at the other people sitting at the table. A couple of the women were eyeing him speculatively, causing him to grimace. Setting the glass down he looked around the room, spotting Mana at a nearby table, chatting away happily. Turning back to his own table, he pushed his appetizer away, studying the tabletop.  
男子想到这里皱起了眉头，拿起杯子喝了一口，试图驱散嘴里的苦涩。他边喝边用眼角余光扫视着同桌的其他人。其中几位女士正若有所思地打量着他，这让他不禁皱眉。放下杯子，他环顾四周，看到 Mana 在邻桌愉快地聊天。转回自己的桌子，他把开胃菜推开，凝视着桌面。

"So…how is he?" Shinji asked quietly moments later.  
"那么……他怎么样了？" 片刻后，真嗣轻声问道。

Rei stopped eating, studying her friend. "Good, though he has not been himself lately." She paused. "He has asked about you, how you are doing at work, if you are healthy and other topics."  
绫波停下用餐，审视着她的朋友。“挺好的，不过他最近有些反常。”她停顿了一下。“他问起你了，比如你在工作上怎么样，身体是否健康，还有其他一些话题。”

"Bastard must want something if he's interested in me," growled Shinji, ignoring the anger in his voice.  
“如果他对我感兴趣，那混蛋肯定有所图谋，”真嗣咆哮道，无视了自己声音中的怒气。

"Maybe he wants to repair the bridge between you."  
“或许他是想修复你们之间的桥梁。”

"Twenty-one years, Rei." He looked up, seeing a couple of people flinch at his expression. "In twenty-one years he has never acknowledged my existence. I gave him many opportunities, but he ignored them, burning the bridge faster each time I tried to connect with him." The glass in his hand creaked at the pressure. "Letters written were never answered, cards returned, and…"  
"二十一年了，零。" 他抬头，看到几个人因他的表情而退缩。"二十一年来，他从未承认过我的存在。我给了他很多机会，但他都置之不理，每次我试图与他沟通，他都更快地烧毁了那座桥梁。" 他手中的玻璃杯因压力而吱嘎作响。"写去的信从未得到回复，卡片被退回，还有……"

"People make mistakes." "人都会犯错。"

"I know, I've made enough of them."  
"我知道，我自己也犯了不少。"

"Excuse me, I have to leave for a moment."  
"劳驾，我得离开一会儿。"

Shinji didn't wait for the others to acknowledge his comment before he was out of his seat and moving toward the restroom. His stomach churned as the last two hours replayed through his mind. He had listened to people recite their dating and work records with disgust, and learned more tips for various hobbies than he cared to know. Pushing open the door, the man saw the restroom was empty and moved to a washbasin. Splashing his face with cold water he closed eyes, remembering how others had talked about school and who had liked him, and it just kept going on and on.  
真嗣没有等待其他人回应他的话，就起身向洗手间走去。过去两小时的情景在他脑海中不断回放，令他胃里翻江倒海。他听着人们厌恶地讲述他们的约会和工作经历，学到了许多他本不想知道的各类爱好小贴士。推开门，他发现洗手间空无一人，便走向洗手池。用冷水泼了泼脸，他闭上眼睛，回想起别人谈论学校和谁喜欢他的情景，这一切仿佛永无止境。

"You feeling okay, Shinji?"  
"你还好吗，真嗣？"

The man turned his head to see Touji leaning against the door, barring others from entering. Smiling, he turned off the water and grabbed a towel, drying his hands. Sitting on the counter, resting his hands on his knees, Shinji stared at his friend.  
那人转过头，看见东治靠在门上，挡住了其他人进入。他微笑着关掉水龙头，抓起一条毛巾擦干手。坐在柜台上，双手搭在膝盖上，真嗣凝视着他的朋友。

"Yeah, I'm okay. It's just that people don't realize how boring it is to listen to others talking about work, girlfriends, and home over and over," he sighed in disgust. "It's just…"  
“嗯，我没事。只是人们没意识到一遍遍听别人谈论工作、女朋友和家庭有多无聊，”他厌恶地叹了口气，“就是……”

"That's not the problem," interrupted Touji. "Why don't you just come out and say it."  
“问题不在这儿，”东治打断道，“你为什么不直说呢。”

"Say what?" asked Shinji, confused.  
"说什么？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"That you miss piloting EVA, the Angels and the fighting."  
"说你怀念驾驶 EVA，对抗使徒和战斗。"

"I don't know…" "我不确定……"

"Bullshit!" Touji walked toward his friend. "You know that since you stopped piloting you haven't felt alive, you feel average."  
"胡扯！" 东治走向他的朋友。"你知道自从你不驾驶以来，你就没有感到活着，你感觉自己很平庸。"

"And if I do, then what?"  
"那又怎样？"

"Don't know, but it would be a first step. It would explain why you don't like reunions because they remind you of what you were and how average you are now." The taller man rested his hands on Shinji's shoulders. "You know it's true."  
"不知道，但那会是一个开始。这可以解释为什么你不喜欢聚会，因为它们提醒你曾经的你和现在的平庸。" 高个子男人将手放在真嗣的肩膀上。"你知道这是真的。"

"Fine," Shinji said, glaring. "But I don't feel any different."  
"好吧，" 真嗣瞪着眼说，"但我没感觉有什么不同。

"I didn't say it'd work immediately." Touji walked toward the door. "Let's get a drink."  
"我没说它会立刻见效。" 东治走向门口，"我们去喝点东西吧。

"So that's why Kensuke isn't here."  
"所以这就是为什么健介不在这里。"

Shinji bowed his head, laughing at hearing the whole story of Kensuke's sudden job assignment. It had been a casual inquiry of why their friend hadn't come to the reunion, then turned into a time of reminiscing of all their experiences. Holding his drink in both hands, he let his laughter die, feeling the cold seeping into his hands. Taking a sip he cherished the taste of the alcohol as it slid smoothly over his tongue, with its woody taste before trickling down his throat, finally ending up in his stomach and warming him. He wasn't even aware of the shift in the atmosphere of the bar as it went silent behind him.  
真嗣低下头，听完健介突然的工作派遣故事后笑了起来。原本只是随意询问为何他们的朋友没来参加聚会，结果却变成了一起回忆往昔的时光。他双手捧着饮料，笑声渐止，感受到寒意渗入手心。他轻啜一口，细细品味着酒精滑过舌尖的木质香气，随后顺喉而下，最终落入胃中，温暖了全身。他甚至没察觉到身后酒吧气氛的转变，四周已悄然无声。

"Excuse me, do you know where I could find Shinji Ikari?"  
“打扰一下，您知道在哪里能找到碇真嗣吗？”

The man tensed up when he heard that question behind him, yet the speaker wasn't asking him. He felt his body trembling for some reason while he tried to place the speaker. He didn't know the woman's voice and way of speaking, and he couldn't place her accent. Still he didn't turn around when one of their former schoolmates responded to her. The smell of her perfume was the only warning when she stopped behind him. Again, he couldn't place the scent, yet it teased his memory. Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji saw Touji start in surprise, coughing up his drink.  
那人听到身后传来的问题时，身体不由得一紧，然而那并非在问他。不知为何，他感到自己的身体在颤抖，试图辨认出说话者的身份。他不熟悉那女子的声音和说话方式，也听不出她的口音。尽管如此，当他们的一位老同学回应她时，他并没有转身。当她停在他身后时，她身上的香水味是唯一的警告。他依旧无法辨认出那香味，但它却撩拨着他的记忆。从眼角余光中，真嗣看到东治惊讶地跳了起来，呛出了口中的饮料。

"Shinji Ikari?" The woman's voice held a hint of worry as she briefly touched his arm.  
“碇真嗣？”女子的声音带着一丝担忧，她轻轻触碰了他的手臂。

Nodding, he spun on his seat, coming face to face with the inquisitor. His breath caught in throat when he saw how beautiful her face was from moist, red lips to creamy white skin and finally staring into sparkling blue eyes. The man found himself looking over her, seeing a tall, exquisite woman with more than modest dimensions wearing a knee-length black dress that clung to her athletic figure. Her hands were crossed in front, nails painted in red. He swallowed when she brushed some auburn hair off her shoulder, realizing who it was.  
他点了点头，随即转过身来，直面提问者。当他看到她那从湿润的红唇到奶油般白皙的肌肤，再到闪烁着光芒的蓝眼睛时，他的呼吸一窒。男子发现自己正打量着她，眼前是一位高挑、身材出众的女子，穿着一件紧贴她健美身形的黑色及膝裙。她的双手交叉在身前，指甲涂成了红色。当她将一缕赤褐色的头发拂到肩后时，他咽了口口水，意识到她是谁。

"…Asuka?" "…明日香？"

The woman frowned slightly. "You don't sound so sure with your answer, Shinji. Maybe this'll help." She leaned in close, whispering. "Remember our first kiss?"  
女子微微皱眉，说道：“你的回答听起来不太确定呢，真嗣。或许这个能帮你回忆起来。”她倾身靠近，低声细语：“还记得我们的初吻吗？”

Asuka's question had the opposite effect then she had expected as Shinji spun around and grabbed his glass. The redhead pursed her lips, thinking of how to correct the situation. She glanced at Touji when he rose from his seat and nodded at her, which earned him a smile. Sitting down, the woman smoothed her dress over slender legs before turning to Shinji. She saw the blush on his cheeks when her leg touched his before she grabbed his hand.  
明日香的问题出乎意料地产生了相反的效果，真嗣转身抓起他的杯子。红发女孩抿紧嘴唇，思考着如何扭转局面。她瞥见东治从座位上站起来，向她点头，这让她回以微笑。坐下后，女子整理了一下裙摆，露出修长的双腿，然后转向真嗣。当她的腿触碰到他的时，她看到了他脸上的红晕，随后她握住了他的手。

"I'm sorry," she apologized, momentarily biting her lower lip. "I shouldn't have said that, especially with what happened eight years ago."  
"对不起，"她道歉道，一时咬了咬下唇。"我不该说那些，尤其是在八年前那件事之后。"

"You're right, you shouldn't have brought it up." Shinji winced at the anger in his voice.  
"你确实不该提起。" 真嗣听到自己声音中的怒气，不禁皱了皱眉。

"I wanted to lighten the mood." The woman took a couple deep breaths. "But I guess you still have a lot of pain from me." She nodded at his silence. "I didn't come here to fight with you or torment you. I'll understand if you don't want me around."  
"我本想缓和一下气氛。" 女子深吸了几口气。"但看来你还是因为我而感到痛苦。" 她对他的沉默点了点头。"我来这里不是为了和你争吵或折磨你。如果你不想我在这里，我能理解。"

With that she fell silent, waiting for an answer from the man next to her. Her nervousness grew, as he didn't respond to her last statement, instead he continued to stare straight ahead. She had been sincere about not wanting to torment him or fight. Sighing, she reached out for her purse, knowing that it had been wrong for her to approach him.  
说完，她陷入了沉默，等待着身旁男子的回应。随着他未对她的最后陈述作出回应，反而继续直视前方，她的紧张感愈发强烈。她真心不想折磨他或争吵。叹了口气，她伸手去拿自己的包，意识到自己来找他是个错误。

"Don't go." His request was barely above a whisper, but it was the hand on her wrist that stopped her. He turned to face her. "Don't go, please."  
"别走。"他的请求几乎低不可闻，但正是他放在她手腕上的手阻止了她。他转过身来面对她。"请别走。"

She sat down, relieved. "Okay."  
她坐了下来，松了口气。"好的。"

"I guess…it's the surprise," Shinji began after some silence. "In eight years I hear nothing from you. Never a phone call, email, or even a short letter." He looked away briefly. "Now you show up out of the blue, and the first thing you do is bring up that kiss."  
"我猜…是惊讶吧，" 沉默片刻后，真嗣开口道，"八年来我完全没你的消息。没有电话，没有邮件，甚至连一封短信都没有。" 他短暂地移开视线，"现在你突然出现，第一件事就是提起那个吻。

"Stupid of me, I know," she admitted.  
""我知道，我真傻，" 她承认道。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

The redhead waved the bartender away when he came over for her order, not wanting anything to drink. She felt her cheeks heat up when she turned her head and saw Shinji staring at her. Old memories of silent stares and limited conversations surfaced, and she felt anger starting to build as he continued to sit there not saying a word, but she forced it down. There was no reason she should be angry with him, he wasn't ignoring her or being rude, and it wasn't 2019 anymore. Slowly, she counted to ten and back down, calming herself and thinking. When she was sure she wouldn't say anything she'd regret Asuka reached a decision.  
"当酒保过来询问她的点单时，红发女子挥手让他离开，此刻她什么都不想喝。转头看到真嗣正盯着她，她的脸颊不由得发热。往昔那些沉默的对视和有限的对话涌上心头，随着他继续坐在那里一言不发，她感到怒气开始积聚，但她强迫自己压下这股情绪。没有理由对他发火，他并没有忽视她或无礼，而且现在也不是 2019 年了。她缓缓地从十数到一，再倒数回来，平复自己的情绪，思考着。当确信自己不会说出后悔的话时，明日香做出了决定。

"You up for a walk?" she inquired, smiling coyly as she stood.  
"想出去走走吗？" 她询问道，微笑中带着几分俏皮，站起身来。

"A walk?" "走走？"

"Just like the Shinji I remember, always repeating himself over the obvious." Asuka reached down at grabbed his wrist, pulling him towards the door before letting go. "Yes, a walk. A stroll between former colleagues who haven't seen each other in ages."  
"果然还是我记忆中的真嗣，总是对显而易见的事情重复确认。" 明日香伸手抓住他的手腕，拉着他向门口走去，随后松开手。"对，就是散步。久别重逢的前同事之间的一次漫步。"

"Have you talked to Hikari? She'd be disappointed if you showed up and left without talking to her."  
"你跟光说过话了吗？如果你来了又走，没跟她说话，她会失望的。"

The redhead's smile grew as she pointed over her shoulder at the mess of people crowding the entranceway. Hikari stood off to one side with Touji, nodding slightly as he locked eyes with her. Swallowing, he stood up, following Asuka to the entrance, stopping next to their friends.  
红发女孩的笑容扩大了，她指了指身后那群挤在入口处的人群。光站在一旁，和东二一起，当东二与她目光交汇时，她微微点头。他咽了口口水，站起身来，跟着明日香走向入口，停在他们的朋友旁边。

"You don't have to apologize, Shinji," stated the brunette. "Go with Asuka, spend a little time catching up with her."  
"你不必道歉，真嗣，" 棕发女孩说道，"跟明日香一起去吧，花点时间和她叙叙旧。"

"Okay." "好的。"

"Fine." "好的。"

Shinji stopped and turned toward the redhead as he heard a frustrated sigh come from her. The sounds of water lapping at the rocks faded, and her question disappeared from his mind as he stared at her. With her hands planted on her hips and hair blowing in the breeze she presented an image of the old Asuka. But as he glanced at her face, the man knew that wasn't true. Instead of anger, her features presented a pleading and sad appearance. Suddenly he felt like crap for his answer to a legitimate question.  
真嗣停下脚步，转向红发少女，耳边传来她懊恼的叹息。水拍打岩石的声音渐渐消失，她的问题也从他脑海中消散，他只是凝视着她。她双手叉腰，发丝随风飘扬，呈现出昔日明日香的模样。但当他瞥见她的面容时，他明白那并非真相。她的表情不是愤怒，而是带着恳求和悲伤。突然间，他为自己的回答感到愧疚，那本是一个合理的问题。

"Don't do this, Shinji," Asuka said quietly.  
"别这样，真嗣，"明日香轻声说道。

"Do what?" he asked before wincing, knowing what she was saying.  
"怎样？"他问道，随即皱眉，心里清楚她指的是什么。

"You know what I mean. I'm trying here, Shinji. The least you could do is try too."  
"你明白我的意思。我在这里努力，真嗣。你至少也应该尝试一下。"

Asuka watched him nod slowly before he walked past her. After a few steps he turned and glanced over his shoulder at her. She swallowed at the look he gave her, feeling her cheeks heat up. Over the years she had received many stares from males but as Shinji stood there waiting, the redhead knew this time it was different. A ghost of a smile formed on her lips when she caught up to him and they started walking again. Her happiness faded while he remained quiet, the only sound was of their feet on the pavement. His arm brushed against her, directing her to an observation deck built over the water.  
明日香看着他缓缓点头，然后从她身边走过。走了几步后，他转过身，从肩膀上瞥了她一眼。她咽了口口水，面对他投来的目光，感到脸颊发热。这些年她从男性那里收到过许多目光，但当真嗣站在那里等待时，红发少女知道这次不同。当她赶上他，他们再次开始行走时，她唇边浮现出一丝微笑。然而，他的沉默让她的快乐消退，只剩下他们的脚步声在人行道上回响。他的手臂轻轻触碰到她，引导她走向一个建在水面上的观景台。

"I'm sorry," he said, leaning against the railing, staring out across the moonlit water.  
"对不起，"他靠在栏杆上，凝视着月光下的水面说道。

"Don't say…" she stopped as he spun around.  
"别说…" 她话音未落，他已转身。

"No, I am sorry," he said firmly. "You're right. I haven't been trying that hard to talk with you."  
"不，我很抱歉，" 他坚定地说，"你说得对，我确实没有努力和你沟通。"

Asuka shook her head. "Then why are you still…" Her words trailed off as he frowned. "What's wrong?"  
明日香摇了摇头，"那为什么你还…" 她的话随着他皱起的眉头戛然而止，"怎么了？"

The man knew this was the moment he had spent the last eight years waiting for, yet as he opened his mouth to speak, the words caught in his throat. It wasn't supposed to be this hard, he argued with himself. All he had to do was ask a simple question and hope for an answer from the woman. Yet as they stared at each other waiting for him to speak, he knew it wasn't going to be simple. Averting his gaze, the man ran his fingers through his hair before swallowing and making eye contact again.  
男人知道，这是他过去八年里一直等待的时刻，然而当他张开嘴想要说话时，话语却卡在了喉咙里。这不应该这么难，他内心争辩着。他只需要问一个简单的问题，并期待女人的回答。然而，当他们相互凝视，等待他开口时，他明白这不会是简单的。他移开视线，男人用手梳理了一下头发，然后咽了口唾沫，再次与她对视。

"What's wrong is that I don't know…" His fists clenched and he shook. "I don't know why you left eight years ago! I don't know if it was something I did or failed to do. Or if it was something I said or failed to say!" Tears trickled down his cheeks. "Did I mean so little to you that you couldn't explain to me why you were leaving?" His voice dropped from a yell to a whisper. "Why Asuka? Why did you leave? I need to know! Please." The last word was barely audible.  
问题在于我不知道……"他握紧拳头，身体颤抖。"我不知道八年前你为什么要离开！我不知道是因为我做了什么，还是没做什么。或者是因为我说了什么，还是没说什么！"泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落。"我对你来说就那么微不足道吗，以至于你不能向我解释为什么要离开？"他的声音从喊叫降到了低语。"为什么，明日香？你为什么要离开？我需要知道！求你了。"最后一个词几乎听不见。

"I guess I should finally explain," she whispered after some moments of silence.  
"我想我终于应该解释一下了，"沉默片刻后，她低声说道。

"Yes," his voice was just as quiet. "When you rejected me I never asked why. I endured your anger, never knowing why you lashed out at me or avoided me as much as possible." He stepped closer, pain on his face. "I never asked for an explanation for a lot of things, but this time it's different."  
"是的，"他的声音同样低沉。"当你拒绝我时，我从未问过为什么。我忍受着你的怒气，却从不知道你为何对我发火，或是尽可能地避开我。"他走近一步，脸上带着痛苦。"我从未要求过很多事情的解释，但这次不同。"

"Shinji…" "真嗣……"

"I just can't pretend nothing happened eight years ago! I can't force myself to forget so many years have passed since you left," he continued, not hearing her voice. "I need to know so I can finally put the past…"  
"我就是无法假装八年前什么都没发生过！我无法强迫自己忘记你离开后的这么多年，"他继续说道，没有听见她的声音。"我需要知道，这样我才能最终放下过去……"

"Shinji, be quiet!" Asuka shouted. "I know all that," she said softly at his look a moment later.  
"真嗣，安静点！" 明日香喊道。"我都知道，" 片刻后，她在他目光的注视下轻声说道。

"Then why?" "那为什么？"

The redhead looked down and walked over to a bench before sitting down. She smoothed the dress over her legs, playing with the hemline. A gust of wind blew some stray strands of hair into her face, causing her to reach up and brush it out of the way. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her former roommate stick his hands in his jacket pockets. Even a mist of water against her legs did nothing to break the appearance of calm. Yet her mind was racing while she sat there above the water.  
红发少女低下头，走向一张长椅坐下。她抚平裙摆，摆弄着裙边。一阵风吹乱了几缕发丝，拂过她的脸庞，她伸手将其拨开。眼角余光中，她看到曾经的室友将手插进夹克口袋。即便水雾轻触她的双腿，也未打破她表面的平静。然而，她的思绪却在水面上方坐着时飞速运转。

That Shinji had asked for an explanation for why she had left years ago was no surprise. She would've expected the same thing from him if their places were reversed. During the plane trip back to Japan she had sifted through her past again, especially her time in Tokyo-3, trying to organize all her thoughts and emotions. Still she had hoped he would have waited a short time for an answer, after all he hadn't had an explanation in eight years so a week shouldn't have made any difference. But here she was, less than twelve hours after arriving back in Japan, presented with the situation she had been dreading for years. A polite cough broke her musing and she looked up to see him waiting, worry evident on his features. Averting her gaze, she concentrated on her hands, which were clasped together tightly.  
真嗣要求解释她多年前为何离开，这并不令人意外。如果角色互换，她也会期待他给出同样的解释。在返回日本的飞机上，她再次回顾了自己的过去，尤其是她在第三新东京市的时光，试图整理所有的思绪和情感。尽管如此，她还是希望他能稍等片刻再寻求答案，毕竟他八年来都没有得到解释，再多等一周应该也无妨。然而，她刚回到日本不到十二小时，就面临着多年来一直害怕面对的局面。一声礼貌的咳嗽打断了她的沉思，她抬头看到他正等待着，脸上的担忧显而易见。她避开他的目光，专注于自己紧握的双手。

"I guess the easiest answer would be that I…hated you," she began, looking down at the boards. "Shinji, the good boy, was always there for others but never for me, never for me."  
“我想最简单的答案可能是我……恨你，”她开始说道，低头看着地板。“真嗣，那个总是为别人着想的好孩子，却从未为我，从未为我考虑过。”

"That's not true!" “这不是真的！”

"That's the way I saw it back then," commented Asuka. "Where were you after the 15th Angel?"  
"那时我是这么看的，"明日香评论道。"第 15 使徒之后你在哪里？"

Shinji took a step toward the woman. "I was locked in cryostasis or I would've…"  
真嗣向那位女士迈了一步。"我被锁在低温休眠中，否则我会……"

"I know now and knew then that you couldn't have come to my aid but," she comment quietly, "I said after, not during my rape."  
"我现在知道，当时也明白你不可能来救我，但是，"她轻声评论道，"我说的是之后，而不是我被侵犯的时候。"

"You pushed…" The man shut his mouth with a click of teeth.  
"你推了…" 男人咔哒一声咬紧了牙关。

"That's right. Everything was my fault because I pushed you away, hurt you or insulted you, but that was just an excuse." The next words were a susurration. "On both our parts."  
"没错。一切都是我的错，因为我推开了你，伤害了你，或是侮辱了你，但这只是个借口。" 接下来的话细如蚊吟。" 对我们双方来说都是。"

"I know," whispered Shinji.  
"我知道，" 真嗣低声说道。

The woman bowed her head. "I sort of expected that you'd figured that out by now. But still there were a couple of times when you stood up for yourself, disobeying orders because you thought you knew what was best. You even helped me out, and I never…thanked you." She wiped at her nose. "I guess it's my own fault that you always left me alone at the worst moments, at the wrong times."  
那女子低下头。“我本以为你早就明白了。但还是有几次，你为了自己挺身而出，违抗命令，因为你认为你最清楚什么才是最好的。你甚至帮助过我，而我从未……向你道谢。”她擦了擦鼻子。“我想，你总在最糟糕的时刻、错误的时间留我一个人，这大概是我自找的。”

"I thought that was what you wanted at the time," he admitted quietly. "You were always saying how you wanted to be left alone."  
“我当时以为那是你想要的，”他轻声承认。“你总是说你想一个人待着。”

"Did that do any good, leaving me alone?"  
“留下我一个人，有什么好处吗？”

"No, but Asuka I can't change the past."  
"不，但明日香，我无法改变过去。"

"Yeah, the past." The redhead nodded, looking at her feet. "But that wasn't all. After the 16th Angel you ran to see your precious Rei, brushing me aside, not caring how I was feeling at the time. And when I was at Hikari's you never called."  
"是啊，过去。"红发少女点了点头，目光落在自己的脚上。"但不仅仅是那件事。在第 16 使徒事件后，你跑去看你心爱的绫波，把我晾在一边，丝毫不顾及我当时的心情。还有，我在光家里的时候，你一个电话都没打来。"

"Again I thought I was respecting your wishes." He walked over to her and rested a hand on her shoulder.  
"再次，我以为我是在尊重你的意愿。"他走过去，将一只手轻轻放在她的肩上。

Her fists clenched tightly at the next memory. "Then…you left me alone to fight those EVAs. I know everything so I don't…hate you, but it hurt back then."  
她的拳头在下一个记忆中紧握。“然后……你留下我一个人去对抗那些 EVAs。我知道一切，所以我并不……恨你，但那时真的很痛。”

"If I could…" He stopped, remembering his words about not being able to change the past. "I was such an idiot."  
“如果我能……”他停顿了，回想起自己关于无法改变过去的言论。“我真是个傻瓜。”

"You always told me how much you cared, but your actions never matched your words. That hurt, made me feel worthless, but that wasn't all." Her voice cracked slightly. "Every time I looked at you, I didn't see the boy who saved me, but a painful memory. I hated you for what you did to me during Instrumentality. Or what you failed to do for me would be closer."  
“你总是告诉我你有多在乎，但你的行为从未与你的话语相符。那伤害了我，让我感到自己毫无价值，但这并不是全部。”她的声音微微颤抖。“每次我看向你，我看到的不是那个救了我的男孩，而是一个痛苦的记忆。我恨你，因为你在我经历人类补完计划时对我所做的一切。或者更确切地说，是你未能为我做的。”

"Asuka, I tried…" He stopped when she looked up, seeing tears on her cheeks.  
"明日香，我尝试了…" 他停了下来，当她抬头时，他看到了她脸颊上的泪水。

"Be quiet, please. You wanted to know," she told him, not caring about her tears. "You had the power of a god to do whatever you wanted! The world could have been yours, shaped to your will or desires. Nothing was outside your power during that time. I know you saw all the pain in my soul and yet you did nothing, nothing." The redhead shook her head. "Do you know what you did to me because of your inaction? The number of sleepless nights I've had since that day! Or how many times I've woken up screaming from nightmares, alone and scared!" Her fists clenched tighter, threatening to draw blood. "You brought Rei, Misato, and Ritsuko back yet for me…"  
"请安静，你不是想知道吗，"她对他说，不在乎自己的泪水。"你曾拥有神一般的力量，可以随心所欲！世界本可以任你塑造，你的意志或欲望无所不能。在那段时间里，没有什么是你力所不能及的。我知道你看到了我灵魂中的所有痛苦，但你却什么也没做，什么也没做。"红发女孩摇了摇头。"你知道你的不作为对我做了什么吗？自从那天起，我有多少个无眠之夜！或者我有多少次从噩梦中惊醒，独自一人，害怕极了！"她的拳头握得更紧了，几乎要掐出血来。"你复活了绫波、美里和律子，但对于我……"

"You healed my body, oh god, I'm so grateful for that, but…" A sob escaped her mouth. "But you left my memories unaltered. Everything I wanted to forget, every painful moment was left intact. Mama's time in the hospital and her suicide, my losses to the Angels." Her voice was picking up speed as she spoke. "Kaji's rejection of me when I needed him, the depression I slowly sank into caused by you and myself." Asuka absently ran a hand up her right arm, stopping at her eye. "My defeat and wounding by those Evangelions yet I don't have any scars, just nightmares."  
"你治愈了我的身体，哦，上帝，我对此感激不尽，但是……" 她哽咽着说。"但你没有改变我的记忆。所有我想忘记的，每一个痛苦的瞬间都完好无损。妈妈在医院的时光和她的自杀，我输给那些天使的次数。" 她的语速随着话语加快。"当我需要他时，加持对我的拒绝，你和我共同导致的我慢慢陷入的抑郁。" 明日香无意识地用手抚摸着自己的右臂，停在眼睛的位置。"被那些福音战士击败和伤害，但我身上却没有留下任何疤痕，只有噩梦。"

"Oh god!" she cried suddenly, the memories too much for her. "Why didn't you help me! Why didn't you alter my memories! If you cared so much about me why didn't you…"  
"哦，天哪！" 她突然哭喊起来，记忆的冲击让她难以承受。"你为什么不帮我！为什么你不改变我的记忆！如果你真的在乎我，为什么你不……"

Her question was interrupted as Shinji quickly pulled her to her feet. She barely had time to realize what was happening before arms wrapped around her and hugged her, tight. His chin rested lightly on her shoulder and she could hear his ragged breathing. Somehow hearing his labored breath was reassuring, that she wasn't the only one hurting. After a moment she slowly reached up, wrapping her arms around his torso.  
她的问题被真嗣迅速拉她起身打断了。她还没来得及反应发生了什么，就被拥入怀中，紧紧抱住。他的下巴轻轻搭在她的肩膀上，她能听到他急促的呼吸声。不知怎的，听到他吃力的呼吸声竟让她感到安心，意识到自己并非独自承受痛苦。过了一会儿，她缓缓抬起手，环抱住他的腰。

"Why didn't you make me happy?"  
"为什么你不让我快乐呢？"

Shinji closed his eyes at her question, hearing the hurt in her voice. "Because it would've been a lie." He paused, waiting for a response, but when one didn't come he went on. "I could've erased your memories, made you happy and my girlfriend but I couldn't have lived with myself. I would've known that we were together only because I made it so, not because we loved each other." He loosened his arms. "It would've been wrong for me to do that. But most of all because it would've taken away everything that made you special to me."  
听到她的问题，真嗣闭上了眼睛，感受到了她声音中的伤痛。“因为那会是谎言。”他停顿了一下，等待着回应，但当没有回应时，他继续说道。“我本可以抹去你的记忆，让你快乐，成为我的女朋友，但我无法面对那样的自己。我会知道我们在一起只是因为我这么安排了，而不是因为我们彼此相爱。”他松开了手臂。“那样做对我来说是错误的。但最重要的是，那会夺走你对我来说所有特别的东西。”

Asuka closed her eyes at his statement. "I never thought about it that way. I just wanted to be happy for once in my life and you could've granted my wish. And when you didn't," she sniffed lightly, "all I could do was hate you, but even then I couldn't hate you completely."  
听到他的话，明日香闭上了眼睛。“我从没那样想过。我只是想在生命中至少有一次能快乐，而你本可以实现我的愿望。但你没有，”她轻轻地吸了吸鼻子，“我所能做的只有恨你，但即便如此，我也无法完全恨你。”

The man stared out across the water for some time before speaking again. "So it was all my fault; your anger and resentment and then you leaving. I just never knew how much pain I caused you. I should've been there for you more."  
那人凝视着水面良久，才再次开口。“原来一切都是我的错；你的愤怒、怨恨，以及你最终的离去。我从未意识到我给你带来了多少痛苦。我本应该更多地陪在你身边。”

"No, it's not all your fault, not entirely." She swallowed, her voice sorrowful. "The same with how it wasn't just hatred that made me leave."  
“不，并不全是你的错，不完全如此。”她哽咽着，声音充满哀伤。“正如我离开也不仅仅是因为恨。”

Asuka reluctantly released Shinji, immediately missing his body warmth and arms around her. She didn't want to leave the embrace not knowing when she would find herself in another one. It felt nice, and as she walked to the end of the observation deck she kept that firmly in her mind. Her eyes gazed outward taking in the scenery while her mind gazed inward to the past.  
明日香不情愿地松开了真嗣，立刻怀念起他的体温和环绕她的双臂。她不想离开这个拥抱，不知道何时才能再次拥有。这感觉很好，当她走向观察台的尽头时，她将这份感觉牢牢铭记在心。她的眼睛凝视着外面的景色，而她的思绪则回望着过去。

"I wasn't just angry at you for leaving my pain intact or for never being there for me," she began. "It went deeper then that. I was…scared."  
"我不仅仅是因为你留下我的痛苦，或者你从未在我需要时出现而生气，"她开始说道，"这比那更深。我感到……害怕。"

"Scared? You?" Shinji said in disbelief. "You were never scared of anything."  
"害怕？你？" 真嗣难以置信地说，"你从未害怕过任何事情。"

"Yes, I was. Of a great many things." A sad smile formed on the redhead's lips. "Of being forgotten or being killed or not being able to pilot. But what scared me the most was being alone."  
"不，我害怕过。害怕很多事情。" 红发女孩的唇边浮现出一丝悲伤的微笑，"害怕被遗忘，害怕被杀死，害怕无法驾驶。但最让我害怕的是孤独。"

As she said those words, Asuka remembered her promise of never needing anybody made so many years ago. It had seemed like such an easy promise to keep when she was a child, just push everyone away and don't ask for help. But Instrumentality had shown just how wrong she had been; that instead of not wanting anybody she wanted others to care about her, to stay with her. And what did she do when she had the chance to never be alone again? She ran. A tear ran down her cheek as that memory raced through her thoughts. So absorbed in the past, she never heard the man approach.  
当她说出这些话时，明日香想起了多年前她许下的那个承诺——永远不需要任何人。孩提时代，这个承诺似乎很容易遵守，只需推开所有人，不求助于人。但人类补完计划揭示了她的错误；她并非不想要任何人，而是希望别人关心她，陪伴她。而当她有机会永远不再孤单时，她却逃跑了。一滴泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，那段记忆在她的思绪中飞速掠过。她沉浸在过去的回忆中，以至于没有听到那个男人走近的声音。

Shinji walked up behind her and rested his hands on her bare shoulders, feeling a tremor race through her body. "Asuka, you were never alone."  
真嗣走到她身后，将手放在她裸露的肩膀上，感觉到她的身体一阵颤抖。“明日香，你从未孤单过。”

"I know that now," she whispered. "Misato, Hikari, Rei, and even the other Stooges; all of them were my friends. And I was scared of becoming too attached to them."  
“我现在明白了，”她低声说。“美里、光、丽，甚至是其他那些家伙；他们都是我的朋友。我害怕与他们太过亲近。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

Asuka felt more tears sliding down her face at his quiet question. "Because I was afraid of losing them, okay! That if I became too comfortable with being around them something would happen to take everyone away from me. Just like what happened with mama. I lost her, found her after so many years and lost her again." She tensed as Shinji took a deep breath. "I didn't want that to happen with the others."  
听到他平静的疑问，明日香感到更多的泪水滑过脸颊。'因为我害怕失去他们，好吗！如果我太习惯于和他们在一起，就会有什么事情发生，把大家从我身边夺走。就像妈妈那样。我失去了她，多年后找到她，却又再次失去。'她紧张地感觉到真嗣深吸了一口气。'我不想同样的事情发生在其他人身上。'

"What about me?" he asked quietly.  
"那我呢？"他轻声问道。

"You," she whispered. "I didn't know what to think of you back then. At times all I wanted to do was hate you while at others I felt myself growing closer and wanting you around me. Weird isn't it, I wanted to be self-sufficient to never need anyone and yet I wanted people around me." Her head bowed and she looked down into the water. "And it's my fault that you never knew how to react to me. I was always doing and saying one thing, and wanting the opposite deep down." The redhead turned her head and looked him in the eyes. "It was a war I couldn't win, no matter how much I tried. You don't know how much you meant to me at times."  
"你，"她低声说，"那时候我真不知道该怎么看待你。有时我只想恨你，而有时我又发现自己越来越靠近你，希望你在我身边。很奇怪吧，我本想自给自足，永远不需要任何人，却又渴望有人陪伴。"她低下头，凝视着水面。"而你不知道如何应对我，都是我的错。我总是言行不一，内心深处却渴望相反的东西。"红发女孩转过头，直视他的眼睛。"这是一场我无法取胜的战争，无论我多么努力。你不知道你对我有多重要。"

Shinji felt his jaw clench. "If you cared so much then why did you run?"  
真嗣感到自己的下巴紧绷。"如果你那么在乎，为什么还要逃跑？"

Asuka sighed, turning around, refusing to back down from the glare she was receiving. Slowly, she reached up and ran a hand over his cheek, down his jaw and cupped his chin in her palm. The tension in her body fled as he followed her example, but instead of cupping her chin he stroked her cheek. She smiled inwardly at what was happening, like eight years of separation had never happened or that she was explaining her actions. Giving him a faint smile, the redhead brought her hand down to her side.  
明日香叹了口气，转身面对那道目光，毫不退缩。她缓缓抬起手，抚过他的脸颊，沿着下巴，最后用手掌托住他的下巴。随着他模仿她的动作，她身体的紧张感消散了，但他没有托住她的下巴，而是轻抚她的脸颊。她内心微笑，仿佛八年的分离从未发生，或是她在解释自己的行为。红发女孩给了他一个淡淡的微笑，然后将手放回身侧。

"Because it was too much for me to handle," she admitted. "When you asked me out, wanting to become more than just friends or roommates, it was just too much for me. I was still trying to sort out all my feelings concerning the recent events in my life." She leaned forward burying her face in his chest. When she spoke, her voice was muffled. "I wanted to say yes, but I just couldn't."  
“因为我实在承受不了，”她坦白道，“当你向我表白，希望不只是朋友或室友时，我感到压力山大。我还在努力理清近期生活中所有复杂的情感。”她倾身向前，将脸埋进他的胸膛。当她说话时，声音被闷住了。“我本想说愿意，但我就是做不到。”

"So that was why you waited a day before answering me?" His hands moved to her back, gently stroking her.  
“所以这就是你隔天才给我答复的原因？”他的手移到她的背上，温柔地抚摸着。

"Yes, it hurt so much to reach that decision because you had waited for so long. Three years is a long time to wait." She frowned against his chest. "All I could think was that you were asking me because it was convenient, not because you loved me."  
"是的，做出那个决定很痛苦，因为你已经等了太久。三年是一段漫长的等待。" 她皱着眉头抵在他的胸前，"我满脑子想的都是，你之所以向我提出，只是因为方便，并非出于对我的爱。"

"I never had the chance to learn what I felt for you, whether it was love or just a crush."  
"我从未有机会去了解自己对你的感情，究竟是爱还是仅仅一时的迷恋。"

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

Shinji closed his eyes, breathing in deeply, smelling Asuka's shampoo and perfume as they stood there. The situation was just so unreal that he was still trying to catch up. Here he was holding the woman he hadn't seen for eight years, like nothing had happened between them and listening to her cry. He hadn't even meant to hug her, only wanting an answer to his question, but when she had started asking him why he hadn't done anything it had hit a nerve. He had acted without thinking, something he had done before with the redhead. Still he was at a loss as what to do next, not knowing what to say or how to act. When her arms went around him again, he smiled faintly.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，闻着明日香洗发水和香水的味道，他们就这样站着。这情形太不真实，他还在努力跟上节奏。此刻，他正抱着八年来未曾见面的女人，仿佛他们之间什么都没发生过，听着她的哭泣。他原本并不打算拥抱她，只想得到问题的答案，但当她开始质问他为何什么都没做时，触动了他内心的某根弦。他未经思考便行动了，这种事他以前也做过，对象是那位红发女孩。然而，接下来该做什么，他依旧茫然，不知该说什么，也不知该如何是好。当她的手臂再次环抱住他时，他微微一笑。

"You hungry?" he whispered.  
"你饿了吗？" 他低声问道。

The redhead pulled back so she could look at the man, seeing tears on his cheeks. "What are you, stupid? I'm in tears and you're thinking about food"  
红发女子后退一步，以便看清男子，只见他脸颊上挂着泪珠。"你傻吗？我都哭了，你还在想吃的？"

"I'm sorry," he replied. "I just thought you'd like something to take your mind off of…"  
"对不起，" 他回答道，"我只是觉得你可能想吃点东西，转移一下注意力……"

Asuka removed her arms from around the man and took a step back. She felt herself grinning at his attempt to change the subject. "Well, if you put it like that, I'm starving."  
明日香从那人身边抽回手臂，后退一步。她发现自己正对着他试图转移话题的举动咧嘴笑。“好吧，既然你这么说，我可是饿坏了。”

"Good, I know this little restaurant," Shinji said, grinning. "That is if you don't mind a short train trip."  
“好极了，我知道一家小餐馆，”真嗣笑着说，“只要你愿意坐一小段火车。”

"As long as you're paying."  
“只要你请客就行。”

"I'm sorry I made you cry."  
"对不起，让你哭了。"

Asuka looked up from her bowl, her chopsticks halfway to her mouth, to see Shinji staring at her. Shaking her head, she quickly ate before setting her bowl down. Their meal had recently arrived and she was starving, it always seemed her hunger grew when she was emotional, and after what had just occurred, all she wanted to do was eat.  
明日香从她的碗里抬起头，筷子正要送到嘴边，看到真嗣正盯着她。她摇了摇头，迅速吃完，然后放下碗。他们的饭菜刚到，她饿极了，每当情绪波动时，她的饥饿感似乎就会增加，而刚刚发生的事情之后，她只想吃东西。

"I told you once already, it's not your fault, Shinji," she admonished him. "I've kept it all inside me for eleven years. Tears are only natural after so long."  
"我已经告诉过你一次了，这不是你的错，真嗣，"她责备他。"我已经把这一切埋在心里十一年了。这么长时间后流泪是很自然的。"

"Maybe it would've hurt less if you had told me earlier," he said. "A letter, email or even a phone call could've worked. And it wouldn't have had to been very long, just you telling me that you didn't mean what you said years ago and that you're sorry."  
"或许如果你早点告诉我，痛苦会少一些，"他说。"一封信、一封邮件，甚至一个电话都行。不需要很长，只要告诉我你多年前说的那些话并非本意，以及你为此感到抱歉。"

The redhead shook her head. "You saw what happened when you asked me why I left. It wouldn't have made it any easier do what you suggested, though I did try a couple times to write you a letter a few years back, but I never finished it."  
红发女子摇了摇头。"你看到了，当你问我为什么离开时发生了什么。尽管我确实尝试过几次，几年前想给你写封信，但我从未完成过。"

"You did?" "你真的尝试过？"

"I just said that, didn't I?"  
"我不是刚说了吗？"

"So how come…" He trailed off remembering what had happened. "Never mind."  
"那为什么……" 他话没说完，想起了发生的事。"算了。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

Shinji nodded his head, understanding she was thanking him for not continuing on about the past. Their conversation died at that, with each of them turning their attention back to the meal in front of them. Eating his meal the man found that he was enjoying it, finding the subtle flavors he had missed for so long. Looking up, he watched the redhead eat methodically moving from one part of her meal to the next, wondering if it was her company that made the meal enjoyable. But as he looked at her, he found his eyes returning to her face, now clear of her streaked make-up.  
真嗣点了点头，明白她是在感谢他没有继续谈论过去。他们的对话就此结束，各自将注意力转回到面前的餐食上。男子吃着饭，发现自己很享受这顿饭，久违的微妙味道让他回味无穷。抬头望去，他看着红发女子有条不紊地从餐盘的一角吃到另一角，思索是否是她的陪伴让这顿饭变得如此愉悦。然而，当他注视着她时，目光不由自主地回到了她那张已无泪痕妆容的脸上。

"So beautiful," he whispered, blushing.  
“真美，”他轻声低语，脸颊泛起红晕。

"You say something?" she inquired, looking up to see him studying her.  
“你说了什么吗？”她抬头询问，发现他正凝视着她。

"Nothing." "没什么。"

The former EVA pilot raised one eyebrow in disbelief; she had noticed his glances.  
前任 EVA 驾驶员扬起一边眉毛，表示怀疑；她已经注意到了他的目光。

"I don't believe you, but I'll let it go this time."  
"我不信你，但这次就算了。"

Shinji swallowed at that, even as she smiled mischievously. Tearing his eyes away from her face, he looked down at the empty dishes.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，尽管她正调皮地笑着。他移开目光，不再盯着她的脸，低头看向空盘子。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?"  
“明日香，我能问你件事吗？”

"Is it important?" she inquired.  
“这事重要吗？”她询问道。

"A little," he admitted. “有一点，”他承认道。

The redhead frowned at that, wondering what else would be of importance, besides what he had asked earlier, to Shinji on her first night back. Still she remembered what was significant for him wasn't always serious for her and she wouldn't know until he asked. Pushing her dishes off to one side, she placed her elbows on the table, and rested her chin in a palm. Her eyes locked on to his, glad to see that he returned her gaze without flinching.  
红发女子皱了皱眉，思索着除了之前他问的事情外，还有什么对真嗣来说会是重要的，尤其是在她回来的第一个晚上。她仍然记得，对他来说重要的事情并不总是对她来说同样严肃，除非他问起，否则她不会知道。她把餐具推到一边，双肘撑在桌上，手掌托着下巴。她的目光锁定在他身上，看到他没有回避她的眼神，她感到欣慰。

"Ask away," she said, bluntly.  
“问吧，”她直截了当地说。

"How long are you going to be here in Tokyo-3?"  
"你要在第三新东京市待多久？"

"Why?" She didn't get any joy at watching him squirm for a moment but her eyes softened at the pain on his face.  
"为什么？" 她并没有从看他一时局促不安中得到任何乐趣，但看到他脸上的痛苦，她的眼神柔和了下来。

"Because…I'd like to spend some time with…you, even if it's only going to be for a few days," he told her sadly. "I'd like to get to know you again without the fights and yelling. To get to know the real Asuka or at least a part of her."  
"因为……我想和你共度一些时光，哪怕只是短短几天，" 他悲伤地告诉她，"我想再次了解你，没有争吵和喊叫。去了解真正的明日香，或者至少是她的一部分。"

"Oh." She didn't have a comeback for that except, of course, for the truth. "Well, I've been transferred so I'll be around for awhile, a few years at least."  
"哦。" 她对此无言以对，除了当然，真相。"嗯，我被调职了，所以我会在这里待上一段时间，至少几年。"

"So it's your job," he said bitterly.  
"所以这是你的工作，" 他苦涩地说道。

The hand that gripped his was soft and warm, and completely unexpected. Shinji's eyes darted from where Asuka was holding his hand to her face. She was looking at him with a hurt look on her face, her blue eyes a little watery as she frowned at him.  
握住他的那只手柔软而温暖，完全出乎意料。真嗣的目光从明日香握着他的手的地方移到她的脸上。她正用一种受伤的表情看着他，蓝色的眼睛有些湿润，皱着眉头看着他。

"I came to see you first, not Misato or even Hikari but you, and I don't start work until tomorrow," she told him. "Don't ever forget that."  
"我首先来找的是你，不是美里，也不是光，而是你，而且我明天才开始工作，" 她对他说，"永远别忘了这一点。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I hurt you the most back then, and I wanted a chance to say I'm…sorry." The man watched her closely as he squeezed her hand before releasing it. "I'm so tired of running, Shinji, I want to stop." Her hand slowly slid back across the table, coming to rest in her lap. "I had few friends when I left and have even fewer now that I'm returning. I want you to be my friend again. And I want to be your friend, if you'll allow me." She smiled sadly as she continued. "Like you, I want to forget the fights, to get to know the real you." Asuka felt herself drawn to his dark blue eyes as she spoke the next words.  
""因为那时候我伤你最深，我想有机会说声对不起。" 男人紧握她的手，然后松开，目光紧盯着她。"我厌倦了逃避，真嗣，我想停下来。" 她的手缓缓滑过桌面，最终落在自己的膝上。"我离开时朋友不多，现在回来更是寥寥无几。我希望你能再次成为我的朋友。如果你愿意，我也想成为你的朋友。" 她带着一丝悲伤的微笑继续说道，"就像你一样，我想忘记那些争吵，去了解真正的你。" 明日香感到自己被他深蓝色的眼睛吸引，继续说道。

"I want to start over, Shinji."  
"我想重新开始，真嗣。"

Those last words echoed through his mind as he stared up at the ceiling of his bedroom hours later; sleep an elusive target. He had been prepared for a mediocre night of listening to former classmates and returning late, drained from the boredom. But instead Fate had decided to throw him for a loop, springing an unexpected surprise on him. It had been a shock to see Asuka there, standing behind him and waiting to see how he would react to her presence. What was even more amazing was that they had been able to have a quiet meal after a rather emotional outburst. Most important of all was that he had finally gotten an answer from the redhead, even if it wasn't what he had been expecting.  
那最后的话语在他脑海中回响，几小时后他躺在卧室里盯着天花板，睡眠成了难以捉摸的目标。他本已准备好度过一个平庸的夜晚，听着昔日同窗的闲聊，深夜归来时已是疲惫不堪。然而命运却决定给他一个转折，突然间给了他一个意外的惊喜。在那里看到明日香，站在他身后，等待着他如何反应，这让他震惊不已。更令人惊讶的是，在一番情绪爆发后，他们竟然能共进一顿安静的晚餐。最重要的是，他终于从那位红发少女那里得到了答案，即使那并非他所期待的。

Groaning, Shinji rolled onto his side and stared at the far wall, replaying that moment in his head. Over the years he had thought of various reasons of why she had left, but none of his scenarios had approached the truth. Anger and hatred had been expected but not the emotional pain or learning that she had been unable to face her feelings. What injured him the most was how much he had hurt her back then without realizing it. It had never occurred to him that his inaction at certain events would've had such an impact on the woman. Back then it seemed so simple to leave her alone, to let her heal by herself, because he thought he couldn't have done any good.  
呻吟着，真嗣侧身躺下，凝视着远处的墙壁，脑海中不断回放那一刻。多年来，他设想了各种她离开的原因，但没有一个接近真相。愤怒和仇恨是预料之中的，但情感上的痛苦，以及得知她无法面对自己的感情，却是意料之外。最让他受伤的是，当时他未曾意识到自己对她的伤害有多深。他从未想过，自己在某些事件上的不作为会对她产生如此大的影响。那时，离开她，让她独自疗伤似乎是那么简单，因为他认为自己帮不上任何忙。

Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, he sat up and rested his head in his hands for moment forcing that thought away. What mattered was she had returned and asked for the chance to be friends, to start over again. He picked up a folded piece of paper off his nightstand, staring at the neat handwriting on it and what it signified. Asuka, just before they had parted ways that evening, had written down her address and telephone numbers for both her apartment and cellphone, telling him not to be afraid to call anytime. It was the chance he had been waiting for and now that he had it, he wasn't going to screw up.  
他双腿一摆，从床边坐起，双手撑头，强迫自己将那个念头抛诸脑后。重要的是，她回来了，请求重新开始，成为朋友。他从床头柜上拿起一张折好的纸，凝视着上面工整的字迹及其所代表的意义。就在那天晚上分别前，明日香写下了她的住址和电话号码，包括公寓和手机，告诉他随时可以打电话。这是他一直等待的机会，如今机会在手，他绝不会搞砸。

"Damn it." 该死。

Across the city in a semi-dark apartment, Asuka would've agreed with Shinji's comment. She sat on a messy bed, her back against the cold wall and her knees drawn so she could rest her chin on them. Silver streaks lined her cheeks, but the crying was over and only her slow breathing could be heard in the room. With one slim hand she pushed limp auburn hair out of her face so she could see clearly. Nightmares had found her the moment she had closed her eyes, brought on by her encounter with her former roommate.  
在城市的另一端，一间半明半暗的公寓里，明日香或许会同意真嗣的话。她坐在凌乱的床上，背靠冰冷的墙壁，双膝蜷曲，下巴搁在膝盖上。银色的泪痕划过脸颊，哭泣已止，房间里只剩下她缓慢的呼吸声。她用纤细的手将凌乱的赤褐色头发拨到一边，以便能看得清楚。一闭上眼，噩梦便找上了她，这一切都源于她与前室友的遭遇。

It had felt nice to finally tell him the truth of she had felt and gone through back then. She hadn't lied when telling him she had kept it inside for eleven long years. Bits and pieces had come out in conversations over the years to Hikari, co-workers and her psychologist, but never the whole story. It was a bittersweet victory for the woman, keeping the memories to herself and never sharing them with others. They had kept her going through the years as she rebuilt her life free of EVA and Shinji. But even success could never subdue all her pain.  
终于向他坦白那时自己的感受和经历，让她感到一阵释然。她没有撒谎，告诉他这份秘密已在心中埋藏了漫长的十一年。这些年里，零星的片段曾在与光、同事以及心理医生的交谈中透露，却从未完整诉说过。对这位女士而言，这是一场苦乐参半的胜利，她独自珍藏着回忆，从未与人分享。正是这些记忆支撑着她，在摆脱 EVA 和真嗣后重建生活的岁月里坚持前行。然而，即便成功也无法完全抚平她所有的伤痛。

Sighing, she looked down at her feet and the three small containers gathered there. Reaching down she picked them up, ignoring the rattling of pills within them as she read the labels. Her face hardened and she stood up on shaky legs, the containers still in her hand as she walked to the bathroom. The bright lights caused her to shut her eyes tightly for a moment before opening them and staring at the image in the mirror. She had forgotten how many times in the past she had been confronted by her haunted visage. Shinji had called her beautiful that evening but she didn't feel like it at the moment. A tear caused her to shake her head angrily and stride over to the toilet. With deliberate motions she undid the lids of the drugs. A frown came to her face as she tried to upend the containers, her hand shaking, but failed instead falling to her knees in tears.  
她叹了口气，低头看着脚边的三个小药盒。伸手将它们捡起，无视里面药丸的碰撞声，她读着标签。她的脸色变得坚毅，颤抖着双腿站起身来，手里还握着药盒走向浴室。明亮的灯光让她紧闭双眼片刻，然后睁开，凝视着镜中的影像。她已记不清过去有多少次面对自己那张憔悴的面容。那天晚上，真嗣曾称赞她美丽，但此刻她并不这么觉得。一滴泪水让她愤怒地摇头，大步走向马桶。她用刻意的动作打开药瓶盖子。当她试图倒出药丸时，手却颤抖着，最终失败地跪在地上哭泣。

"I hate myself," she said, ashamed. She had told Shinji she wanted to start over, but she couldn't do that if she relied on pills to hide the pain. "I want to stop looking back into the past," she whispered as the containers fell from her hand, "and start looking forward into the future."  
“我讨厌自己，”她羞愧地说。她曾告诉真嗣她想重新开始，但如果依赖药物来掩盖痛苦，她无法做到。“我不想再回顾过去，”她低声说着，药盒从手中滑落，“我要开始展望未来。”

As usual I have to thank my pre-readers for putting up with me. Shinji and Asuka were written the way they were for some specific reasons. Those reasons relate to their pasts and what they've been up to in the past years and a couple of those reasons are in this chapter but the rest will come out in future chapters. So I'll have to ask you to be patient. After all how fun is a story where everything is explained in the first chapter. I still have a few different ideas for this story but they're for later chapters.  
一如既往，我要感谢我的预读者们对我的包容。之所以这样描写真嗣和明日香，是出于一些特定的原因。这些原因与他们的过去以及他们在过去几年中的经历有关，其中一些原因在本章中有所体现，但其余的将在后续章节中揭晓。因此，我必须请求大家保持耐心。毕竟，一个故事如果所有内容都在第一章就解释清楚了，那还有什么乐趣呢？我对于这个故事还有几个不同的想法，但它们将留待后续章节。
