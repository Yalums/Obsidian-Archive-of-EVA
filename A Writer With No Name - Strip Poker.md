"So...explain to me the rules again?" Shinji asked, his face slightly turning red.  
"那么...再给我解释一遍规则好吗？" 真嗣问道，脸上微微泛红。

"Oh don't be embarrassed, Shinji. Here!"  
"哦，别害羞，真嗣。看这里！"

Asuka then handed him a cheater card from the deck that showed off the different types of suits and pairs. Shinji stared at it for a minute, then looked right back up to Asuka. He cracked a tiny smile, the kind that she couldn't help, but love.  
明日香随后从牌堆中递给他一张作弊卡，上面展示了不同类型的花色和组合。真嗣盯着它看了一会儿，然后抬头看向明日香。他露出了一个微小的笑容，那种让她无法抗拒，只能心生爱意的微笑。

"Okay, I got it. Though I got to admit. Looking at you right now makes me want to show you how much I love you. Who knows how long I can contain myself after you start strip teasing me."  
“好吧，我明白了。不过我得承认，现在看着你让我很想向你展示我有多爱你。谁知道在你开始对我进行脱衣舞诱惑后，我还能忍多久。”

Asuka laughed softly at that, because she was thinking of that as well. She and him were one and the same. It was a Saturday evening and everything from dinner to homework was finished. What was their left to do aside from watching TV/playing video games or finding fun new ways to show their love? Yet, here they were trying out Strip Poker for the first time. What brought them here to begin with? Well….  
明日香轻声笑了，因为她也在想同样的事情。她和他是如此相似。这是一个周六的晚上，从晚餐到作业都已完成。除了看电视/玩游戏或寻找新的有趣方式来表达他们的爱，还有什么可做的呢？然而，他们在这里尝试第一次玩脱衣扑克。是什么让他们来到这里的呢？嗯……

Shinji arrived at his shared apartment home around late afternoon.  
真嗣在傍晚时分回到了他们合租的公寓。

"Everyone! I'm hom-MMPH!" Shinji was interrupted by the full force of the Red Demon tackling and pinning him up against the wall. Following that up with a flurry of kisses were guaranteed to leave a few marks. Granted Shinji didn't mind as he returned the favor. After about five minutes of making out in the open door way. The two of them reached out to close the door by pushing the door button.  
"大家！我回——唔！" 真嗣的话被红魔以全力冲撞并按在墙上打断。紧接着一连串的亲吻肯定会在他身上留下痕迹。当然，真嗣并不介意，他同样以亲吻回应。在大门口热吻了大约五分钟后，两人伸手按下门按钮，将门关上。

Since both of them were doing the same action, once the door was closed they locked their hands together. After that, they pulled back their heads and gazed into each other's eyes.  
由于两人都在做同样的动作，门一关上，他们就紧紧握住了彼此的手。随后，他们向后仰头，深情地凝视着对方的眼睛。

"What took you so long, Baka?" Asuka asked in a soft friendly voice.  
"你怎么这么慢，笨蛋？" 明日香用温柔友好的声音问道。

Despite using her old insult to hint at her being slightly angry at Shinji coming home later than usual. She couldn't help, but be happy at her boyfriend's return. Especially since she used said time to finish all her homework, that meant all she had to do was help him out with his and then...well.  
尽管用她那老掉牙的侮辱来暗示她对真嗣晚归有些生气。但她还是忍不住为男友的归来感到高兴。特别是她利用这段时间完成了所有的作业，这意味着她只需要帮他搞定他的作业，然后...嗯。

"You're not going to believe this. You really aren't." Shinji said  
"你不会相信的。真的不会。" 真嗣说

"Hit me with your best shot." Asuka followed it up, smirking.  
"给我来个狠的。" 明日香接着说，嘴角带着一丝坏笑。

"I got detention." "我被留校了。"

"Huh!? For what!?" Asuka said, pulling back surprised. "How could the most soft spoken and friendly boy in Tokyo-3 possibly get detention?  
"啊！？为什么！？" 明日香惊讶地后退了一步。"东京-3 最温和友好的男孩怎么可能被留校？"

"I bumped into the Principal, and accidently spilled his coffee all over his clothes."  
"我撞到了校长，不小心把他的咖啡洒了他一身。"

"And he forced you to serve a detention right then and there!?"  
"然后他当场就逼你接受留校察看！？"

"Yeah, he simply straight up shouted the word 'DETENTION' at the top of his lungs. And pointed down the hallway. I followed suit because you had already taken off to scout out the place. I'm guessing Misato is working late."  
"是啊，他直接扯着嗓子大喊‘留校察看’。还指了指走廊。我只好跟着去，因为你已经跑去探查情况了。我猜美里又在加班。"

"Very late, it's a shame that two hours of that time has been wasted on the Principal being in a bad mood. God Damn baka!"  
"非常晚，真可惜那两个小时都浪费在校长心情不好上。该死的笨蛋！"

"Me or him?" "我，还是他？"

"Who do you think?" she answered, following it up by kissing him once again. Then pulling him with her to their kitchen.  
""你认为呢？"" 她回答道，随即再次吻了他。然后拉着他一起走向厨房。

"Alright, let's get your homework done so we can finally do something interesting."  
"好吧，先把你的作业做完，这样我们终于可以做点有趣的事了。"

"Already done." "已经完成了。"

A brief silence fell over the room as Asuka put the pieces together.  
房间里短暂地陷入了沉默，因为明日香在脑海中拼凑着这些信息。

"Huh, I guess that's one plus to the Principal's Dinner Theater."  
"嗯，我想这是校长晚餐剧院的一个好处吧。"

Shinji this time pulled Asuka in for a kiss. To which he followed it up, by dancing with her for a minute. Then looking deep into her eyes yet again.  
这次，真嗣将明日香拉过来亲吻。随后，他带着她跳了一分钟的舞，再次深情地凝视着她的眼睛。

"Gehen Sie eine Dusche meine Liebe. Ich koche uns etwas Schönes. (Go take a shower my love. I'll cook us something nice.)" he said in his flawed, but cute german accent.  
“去洗个澡吧，亲爱的。我给咱们做点好吃的。”他用那略带瑕疵却可爱的德语口音说道。

He felt Asuka shiver and her entire body warm up with excitement.  
他感觉到明日香颤抖了一下，她的整个身体因兴奋而温暖起来。

"Oooo, ich liebe es, wenn du so redest. (Oooo, I love it when you talk like that.)"  
"哦哦，我就喜欢你这么说话。(Oooo, I love it when you talk like that.)"

She broke away and ran toward the bathroom. To which she closed the door before winking at her love.  
她挣脱开来，跑向浴室。关上门前，她还向她的爱人眨了眨眼。

'Mine Gott, I'm the luckiest person on Earth.' Both of them thought before focusing on something else.  
'我的天哪，我是地球上最幸运的人。'两人都这么想着，然后转而关注其他事情。

**ONE DINNER LATER 一顿晚餐后**

Shinji was in the bathroom brushing his teeth, when he noticed he still had something in his pocket. A deck of cards he "borrowed" from the study hall. It was lying next to a public computer. Probably left behind by one of the janitors or teachers. Might as well take it as a souvenir.  
真嗣在浴室里刷牙时，注意到口袋里还有东西。他从自习室“借”来的一副扑克牌。它就躺在一台公共电脑旁边。可能是某个清洁工或老师遗留下来的。不妨拿来做纪念品。

Though there was no real use for it now. He didn't know any card games. So this was basically as useful as a doorstop. As he walked out of the bathroom, he thought the doorstop idea was pretty funny. So that's what he was going to use it as, but he made the correct choice of walking past Asuka.  
虽然现在没什么实际用处。他不会玩任何纸牌游戏。所以这基本上和门挡一样有用。当他走出浴室时，他觉得门挡这个主意挺有趣的。所以他打算就这么用，但他明智地选择了从明日香身边走过。

"Hey, where are you going?" she asked.  
"嘿，你去哪儿？" 她问道。

"Oh, I got this deck of cards. I picked it up in the detention room. Though I don't know any card games."  
"哦，我拿到了这副扑克牌。是在禁闭室里捡的。不过我不懂任何纸牌游戏。"

"Really!?" Asuka lit up, and ran over to Shinji. She pulled him into the room and sat him down on the ground.  
"真的吗！？" 明日香眼睛一亮，跑向真嗣。她把他拉进房间，让他坐在地上。

"What are we doing?" Shinji asked.  
“我们在做什么？”真嗣问道。

"I'm going to show you how to play...strip poker." Asuka said with a wink.  
“我要教你玩……脱衣扑克。”明日香眨了眨眼说。

Shinji's eyes went wide, and his face became red. Though he started to smirk like Asuka did.  
真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，脸也红了。不过他开始像明日香那样咧嘴笑了起来。

"Alright, let's hope luck is on my side. What are the rules?"  
“好吧，希望幸运站在我这边。规则是什么？”

**ONE RULE EXPLANATION LATER  
一条规则解释完毕**

Shinji's confidence had faded a little.  
真嗣的信心稍稍减弱了些。

"So...explain to me the rules again?" Shinji asked, his face slightly turning red.  
"那么...再给我解释一下规则好吗？" 真嗣问道，脸上微微泛红。

"Oh don't be embarrassed, Shinji. Here!"  
"哦，别害羞，真嗣。来！"

Asuka then handed him a cheater card from the deck that showed off the different types of suits and pairs. Shinji stared at it for a minute, then looked right back up to Asuka. He cracked a tiny smile, the kind that she couldn't help, but love.  
明日香随后从牌堆中递给他一张作弊卡，上面展示了不同类型的花色和组合。真嗣盯着它看了一会儿，然后又抬头看向明日香。他露出了一个微小的笑容，那种让她无法抗拒，只能心生爱意的笑容。

"Okay, I got it. Though I got to admit. Looking at you right now makes me want to show you how much I love you. Who knows how long I can contain myself after you start strip teasing me."  
"好吧，我明白了。不过我得承认，看着你现在的样子，我真想向你展示我有多爱你。谁知道在你开始对我进行脱衣舞诱惑后，我还能忍多久。"

Asuka laughed softly at that, because she was thinking of that as well.  
明日香听到这话轻轻笑了，因为她也在想着同样的事情。

"Think of it as an experiment. With good results, no matter what the outcome is."  
"就把它当作一个实验吧。无论结果如何，都是好结果。"

"Alright...um, deal the cards I guess."  
"好吧...呃，发牌吧。"

Asuka smirked, and dealt the cards. She was more confident than ever. While she wasn't the biggest poker expert, she knew which pair beat what. All she had to do was burn the right cards, and victory was hers. And it would be satisfying….why not sweeten the deal?  
明日香微微一笑，开始发牌。她比以往任何时候都更有信心。虽然她不是最大的扑克专家，但她知道哪些牌能赢哪些。她只需要烧掉正确的牌，胜利就是她的。而且这将令人满意……为什么不增加点甜头呢？

"If one of us has a massive divide between our results. Like a Royal Flush vs. a Pair, the loser not only has to take off two pieces of clothing. They have to dance while doing it too."  
"如果我们之间的结果差距很大。比如皇家同花顺对一对，输家不仅要脱掉两件衣服。还得边脱边跳舞。"

This caught Shinji off guard, and made him gasp so hard. His nose began to bleed. He wiped the tiny amount of blood away, but Asuka sure as hell noticed.  
这让真嗣措手不及，他不禁倒吸一口凉气。他的鼻子开始流血。他擦掉了那一点点血迹，但明日香绝对注意到了。

"HA! I finally got you!" Asuka broke out into laughter.  
“哈！我终于抓到你了！”明日香爆发出笑声。

"Damn, well...let's just say it's been a fantasy of mine."  
“该死，好吧...这么说吧，这曾经是我的一个幻想。”

After catching her breath from laughing, Asuka responded.  
笑到喘不过气来后，明日香回应道。

"All you have to do is ask." she said with a nice smile. She then leaned over and kissed him. Handing him a tissue and pointing down to their card, so they could start the game.  
“你只需要问一声就好。”她带着甜美的微笑说。随后她倾身过去吻了他，递给他一张纸巾，并指向他们的牌，以便开始游戏。

Shinji nodded and picked his cards up. The two of them stared each other down as they burned the cards they didn't need. Shinji knew about the term "poker face". So he hid his mouth, that was grimacing at what cards he was getting, behind the cards. Asuka was confident, but she didn't show it. She had a stone face. And gathered her cards with ease, while trying to peak over Shinji's card shield to see his face.  
真嗣点点头，拿起自己的牌。两人对视着，烧掉了不需要的牌。真嗣知道“扑克脸”这个词，所以他用牌遮住了自己因拿到糟糕牌而扭曲的嘴。明日香自信满满，但她没有表现出来，面无表情地轻松整理着自己的牌，同时试图透过真嗣的牌盾窥视他的表情。

Though she failed, it didn't matter. She got what she needed for the first round. Shinji didn't know the game well enough, so all she needed was a one pair.  
虽然她失败了，但这无关紧要。她已经拿到了第一轮所需的东西。真嗣对游戏还不够熟悉，所以她只需要一对就够了。

"Alright sweetie, cards down." she said. Placing her cards down on the carpeted floor.  
“好了，宝贝，摊牌吧。”她说着，将手中的牌放在铺着地毯的地板上。

It was a pair of threes, nothing much, but something.  
是一对三，虽然不算什么，但总归是个开始。

Shinji then gasped with relief.  
真嗣随后松了一口气，喘息出声。

"Woo, alright. Pair of Kings."  
“哇哦，好吧。一对王。”

Asuka looked down and let her stone face crack.  
明日香低头看着，她那冷若冰霜的表情终于破裂了。

"Damn!" she said while snapping her fingers.  
"该死！" 她一边说着，一边弹了弹手指。

Shinji then put his hand up in a finger gun form.  
真嗣随后将手举起，摆出手指枪的姿势。

"Alright hotstuff, off with the shoes." Shinji said in a bad western american accent. Asuka played along.  
"好吧，帅哥，鞋子脱掉。" 真嗣用蹩脚的美国西部口音说道。明日香配合着演了起来。

"Oh no, don't hurt little old me." she said with her hands in the air. While she kicked her shoes off, one went right into Shinji's face. As Shinji flinched, she pulled out her own finger gun.  
"哦不，别伤害小小的我。" 她双手举起说道。同时，她踢掉了鞋子，一只正好飞向真嗣的脸。真嗣一缩，她便掏出了自己的手指枪。

"BANG BANG!" "砰砰！"

"Aw!" Shinji then spread out on the floor. For a couple of seconds he was silent. Then tuned in.  
"啊！" 真嗣随即摊开在地。几秒钟内他静默无声。然后又恢复了意识。

"I still won." he said.  
"我还是赢了。" 他说。

Asuka made a sour face as Shinji sat up. She was going to get him this time.  
真嗣坐起身时，明日香露出了不悦的表情。这次她一定要赢他。

She dealt the cards again. This time focusing hard on her cards. She stuck with that concentrated face, while glaring back up at Shinji. He took it as a minor threat, so...he didn't feel guilty when all he had was a Jack High. They laid their cards down, and Shinji secretly breathed another sigh of relief.  
她再次发牌，这次全神贯注地盯着牌面。她保持着那副专注的表情，同时瞪着真嗣。他将其视为小小的威胁，所以...当他手里只有一张杰克时，他并不感到内疚。他们摊开牌，真嗣暗自松了口气。

"Pair of Aces, baby!" Asuka exclaimed, sticking her arms up in the air.  
"一对 A，宝贝！" 明日香兴奋地高举双臂。

Shinji simply smiled as he took off his shoes and placed them to the side.  
真嗣只是微笑着，脱下鞋子放在一旁。

"Alright Baka, we're even. Now don't go easy on me, you want to see me dance don't you?"  
"好了，笨蛋，我们扯平了。现在别对我手下留情，你想看我跳舞对吧？"

Shinji perked up again, and let his mind slip.  
真嗣再次振作起来，任由思绪飘散。

"Yes." he said in a desperate yet loving tone.  
“是的。”他用一种绝望却又充满爱意的语气说道。

"Good, cause I want to see you do it too."  
“很好，因为我也很想看你这么做。”

Asuka dealt another pair of cards. This time Shinji tried to keep as calm of a face as possible. Though his eyes gave everything away...or were they? Asuka saw his eyes as looking desperate, especially as Shinji traded in four of his cards. Asuka ended up with two pairs of threes and fives. A pretty lucky break.  
明日香又发了一对牌。这次，真嗣尽量保持尽可能平静的表情。尽管他的眼神泄露了一切...还是说，它们真的泄露了什么吗？明日香看到他的眼神显得很绝望，尤其是当真嗣换掉了四张牌时。结果明日香拿到了两对三和五。相当幸运的一手。

"Beat that kid." she said in another mockingly bad wild west tone. As she laid down her cards.  
“打败那小子。”她用另一种模仿得糟糕透顶的狂野西部口音说道，同时摊开了她的牌。

Shinji simply stared her up and down, from her cards to her smirking face. And when he looked at his cards, he grinned a guilty smile. So, he laid his cards down.  
真嗣只是上下打量着她，从她的牌到她那得意的笑脸。当他看向自己的牌时，他露出了一个内疚的微笑。于是，他摊开了自己的牌。

"Royal flush." "皇家同花顺。"

Asuka couldn't believer eyes, and she made it known.  
明日香简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，她毫不掩饰这一点。

"HOW!" she exclaimed. "HOW IN FLYING F! #, DID. YOU? I!"  
"怎么可能！" 她惊呼道。"怎么可能！你到底是怎么做到的？！"

Shinji in response, held up the cheater card to his side. Smiling as best he could without breaking out into laughter.  
回应着，真嗣举起了那张作弊牌到自己身旁。尽量微笑着，以免忍不住笑出声来。

"I got lucky...I'm pretty used to it."  
“我运气好……我挺习惯的。”

"Oh!? You're used to it, are you!?" Asuka said, getting up in his face so he would back up. Though Shinji held his ground, he didn't mind her being this close. Even if she was pissed off.  
“哦！？你习惯了，是吗！？”明日香说着，逼近他的脸，让他后退。虽然真嗣稳住了脚步，但他并不介意她靠得这么近。即使她很生气。

"You lost the last time. Remember that!" she said while poking him.  
"你上次输了，记得吗！" 她边说边戳他。

Shinji took her hand, held it up to his mouth and kissed it.  
真嗣握住她的手，将其举到嘴边轻轻一吻。

"I wasn't referring to my luck with cards." Shinji said, while gazing into her eyes. His eyes were soft and welcoming. The kind that easily broke down Asuka's front of being pissed. She slowly started blushing, until she couldn't take it anymore. She hugged him, and kissed him on the neck.  
"我不是在说牌运。" 真嗣说着，目光深邃地凝视着她的眼睛。他的眼神温柔而包容，轻易地瓦解了明日香故作生气的伪装。她渐渐脸红，直到无法再忍受，便抱住他，在他脖子上亲了一下。

"That was awesome. You got a royal flush in your first ever poker game." she said while looking at him with a new sense of respect and love. Shinji simply enjoyed being lost in her gaze. Brushing her hair back, and feeling the urge to start making out with her. She sensed this, and took action by deep kissing him first. After a while, she pulled back while giving him a seductive look.  
“太厉害了。你第一次玩扑克就拿到了同花大顺。”她看着他，眼中流露出新的敬意和爱意。真嗣只是沉醉在她的凝视中。轻轻拨开她的头发，心中涌起亲吻她的冲动。她察觉到了这一点，便主动深吻了他。过了一会儿，她退开一步，给了他一个诱惑的眼神。

Shinji did everything he could to contain his lustful emotions, as Asuka backed up and stepped on top of their table. She danced like the strippers do in movies. Emphasizing her legs, boobs and puckering her mouth open. She reached down and removed her socks, which she threw to the side. Didn't want Shinji to be smelling her stinky feet. Then she removed her shirt all while shaking her hips.  
真嗣竭尽全力压抑自己的欲望，而明日香则后退一步，站到了桌子上。她像电影里的脱衣舞女郎一样跳舞，强调着自己的双腿、胸部，并撅起嘴唇。她弯腰脱下袜子，扔到一旁，不想让真嗣闻到她脚上的臭味。然后她一边摇摆臀部，一边脱掉了上衣。

Shinji's brain pretty much stuck right then and there. He did retain some motter functions though, because when Asuka threw her shirt at him. He ripped it off his head quicker than any action he ever did in his life. His wide eyes and open mouth pulled Asuka out of her act. She couldn't help, but laugh at her boyfriend ogling her. Granted, she did just strip for him. Though that was the name of the game.  
真嗣的大脑几乎就在那一刻停滞了。不过他还是保留了一些运动功能，因为当明日香把上衣扔给他时，他比以往任何时候都快地从头上扯下了衣服。他瞪大的眼睛和张开的嘴巴让明日香停下了动作。她忍不住笑出声来，看着男友痴迷地盯着她。当然，她刚刚为他跳了脱衣舞。不过这就是游戏的名称。

She came down from the table, pinched Shinji's nose, and kissed him again. Only to pull back a second later, and criss-cross her legs. Picking up her cards, along with his and the deck. And started dealing a new hand. Shinji slowly, but surely came back down to planet Earth. Though his eyes were still firmly planted on Asuka. Whose assets had grown over the years, and were pretty hard to ignore. He knew, however, that if he wanted to see more of her. He'd need to keep playing. So with shakey...everything, he continued the game.  
她从桌子上下来，捏了捏真嗣的鼻子，又吻了他一下。随即后退一步，双腿交叉坐下。拿起自己的牌，连同他的和整副牌，开始发新的一局。真嗣缓缓地，但确实地回到了现实世界。尽管他的目光依旧牢牢锁定在明日香身上。她的魅力随着年岁增长愈发难以忽视。然而，他知道，如果他想更多地看到她，就需要继续玩下去。于是，带着颤抖的一切，他继续了游戏。

The two continued the game in silence, mainly because Asuka was trying desperately to contain her laughter. And Shinji was focusing on four things at once. His cards, Asuka's beautiful face, and one on the left along with one on the right. Together the two starred each other down, until both of them had gone through their turns.  
两人继续默默地玩着游戏，主要是因为明日香拼命忍住不笑出声。而真嗣则同时专注于四件事：他的牌、明日香美丽的脸庞，以及左右两侧的某物。两人互相凝视，直到各自完成了回合。

"Oh...k-k-k-kay….wh-wha-what do yo-you have." Shinji stuttered out.  
“哦……好……好……好吧……你……你有什么牌？”真嗣结结巴巴地说。

With a giggle, Asuka let her cards fall to the floor. The scattered card hand showed nothing but a:  
伴随着一阵轻笑，明日香让她的牌散落一地。那散乱的牌面显示的不过是：

"Jack High, you probably got another flush with that shaky voice. Interested in seeing more?" she said, leaning in and winking. Her two arms pressing her assets together.  
“杰克高牌，你那颤抖的声音大概又凑成了同花吧。还想看更多吗？”她说着，倾身向前眨了眨眼。她的双臂紧贴着，凸显出她的曲线。

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…. *slap*" Shinji slapped himself to focus.  
“啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊……*啪*” 真嗣扇了自己一巴掌以集中注意力。

"Pair of fours, nothing special!" he blurted out. Now sitting up straight and placing his card hand on the floor. For a second, Asuka looked at the ground in disbelief. And in that second, Shinji noticed her look of disappointment. So, being the best boyfriend in the world. He proposed that:  
“一对四，没什么特别的！”他脱口而出。随即坐直身子，将手中的牌放在地板上。有那么一瞬间，明日香难以置信地看着地面。就在那一瞬间，真嗣注意到了她失望的表情。于是，作为世界上最好的男朋友，他提议道：

"I should give myself a handicap, maybe remove my two shirt layers?"  
“我应该给自己设个障碍，或许脱掉两件衬衫？”

This caught Asuka's attention, who gave Shinji a nice smile and got real close to him.  
这话引起了明日香的兴趣，她对真嗣露出了一个甜美的微笑，并凑近了他。

"Shinji, I'll beat you fairly, and to be honest with you. I too would probably lose my mind if I was looking at you shirtless."  
"真嗣，我会公平地打败你，老实说，如果看到你赤裸上身，我可能也会失去理智。"

"Now!" she exclaimed while standing up.  
"现在！"她站起来喊道。"

She stood prominently with her waist and beltline in Shinji's face.  
她挺立着，腰带和腰线直逼真嗣的视线。

"Take it off winner, but don't go too far."  
“赢家脱掉吧，但别太过火。”

Shinji smiled and laughed as he took off his girlfriend's shorts. Revealing her smooth satin panties. When the shorts fell to her feet, she kicked them off and guided Shinji's head with her finger. To look up at her face. She smirked at his dumb smile, kissed him on the four head, and then sat down on the ground. Keeping her eyes on him to make sure that, if he made the first move. She could properly react and make sure she was in charge.  
真嗣笑着，边笑边脱下女友的短裤，露出了她光滑的缎面内裤。短裤掉到她脚边时，她一脚踢开，用手指引导真嗣的头，让他抬头看她。她对他的傻笑轻蔑一笑，亲吻了他的额头，然后坐在地上，眼睛始终盯着他，确保如果他先行动，她能及时反应并保持主导地位。

Shinji looked at his cards for only a couple of seconds at a time. He mainly wanted to keep his eyes on the naked beauty in front of him. It wasn't uncommon for him to see her naked around this hour, though it was slightly painful to do nothing about it. Aside from playing a game that he knew was solely based on luck. So how long was he going to be sitting here?  
真嗣每次只看几秒钟自己的牌，主要还是想盯着眼前这位一丝不挂的美人。在这个时间看到她裸体并不罕见，尽管什么也不做有点痛苦。除了玩一个他知道完全靠运气的游戏，他还要在这里坐多久呢？

The cards were dealt and another turn passed the two by. The answer to Shinji's question was partially answered.  
牌已分发，又一轮从两人身边溜走。关于真嗣问题的答案，已部分揭晓。

"Pair of 4s." Asuka said.  
“一对 4。”明日香说道。

"*sigh* Pair of 7s." Shinji responded.  
“*叹气* 一对 7。”真嗣回应道。

"GOD DANG IT! Am I going to lose all night!?"  
"该死的！难道我整晚都要输吗！？"

"Again, we can give me a handicap."  
"再说一次，你可以给我让点分。"

"OH NO! You are getting your reward! And you're going to enjoy it."  
"哦不！你就要得到你的奖励了！而且你会享受它的。"

Asuka got up and grabbed a blanket that was laying on their couch. She covered herself with it, then pushed Shinji to the floor. She could feel his heartbeat moving faster and faster. She could feel it more as she covered both of them with the blanket. Rubbing herself against him, feeling his hands move across her body. Their kiss was more deep and intense, though her hands couldn't be found. Until Shinji noticed them undoing her bra strap.  
明日香起身，从沙发上抓起一条毯子。她用毯子裹住自己，然后将真嗣推倒在地。她能感觉到他的心跳越来越快。当她用毯子盖住两人时，这种感觉更加强烈。她摩擦着自己的身体，感受着他的手在她身上游走。他们的吻愈发深沉和激烈，尽管她的手无处可寻。直到真嗣注意到它们正在解开她的胸罩带。

"Take it off, with your teeth." Asuka whispered into his ear.  
“用牙齿脱掉。”明日香在他耳边低语。

She then pushed his head down toward her chest. As gentle as he could be, he bit the center of her bra and pulled it off. She immediately pulled back, wrapping herself in the blanket while giving Shinji a seductive look.  
随后她将他的头推向自己的胸部。他尽可能温柔地咬住胸罩的中心，将其脱下。她立刻后退，用毯子裹住自己，同时向真嗣投去一个诱人的眼神。

"If you want to see more, then you're going to have to win." she said.  
"如果你想看更多，那你得赢才行。" 她说道。

"I feel like I win either way. Considering the circumstances." Shinji responded back.  
"我觉得无论怎样我都赢了。考虑到这些情况。" 真嗣回应道。

"Oh, we're not quitting. You're going to play this out."  
"哦，我们可没打算放弃。你得把这局玩到底。"

"If you insist." Shinji said as he shuffled as best he could. Then dealt out another hand.  
"如果你坚持。" 真嗣尽可能地挪动着身体，然后又发了一手牌。

The two were practically shaking as they played their cards. Soon though they had played their hands, and again Asuka was disappointed in herself.  
两人几乎是颤抖着玩牌。不过很快他们就打完了手里的牌，而明日香又一次对自己感到失望。

"Two pair vs. Ace High? Gott this is not my night." Asuka said as she hit her forehead.  
"两对对 A 高？天哪，今晚真不是我的幸运夜。" 明日香说着拍了拍自己的额头。

"My offer for two pieces of clothing still stands." Shinji offered.  
"我那两件衣服的提议依然有效。" 真嗣提议道。

"What are you talking about? You won!" she answered, as her hands shuffled behind the blanket. Then tossed her panties into his lamp. Right as she was about to open her blanket up, Shinji stopped her.  
"你在说什么呢？你已经赢了！" 她回答，手在毯子后面摸索着。随后将她的内裤扔进了他的台灯里。正当她准备掀开毯子时，真嗣阻止了她。

"You're still wearing that blanket."  
"你还裹着那条毯子。"

Asuka thought for a minute, got a slight smile. Then took him up on the offer.  
明日香想了一会儿，露出一丝微笑。然后接受了他的提议。

"Alright, your funeral." “好吧，你自己看着办。”

"Ha, I couldn't be more alive." he said throwing out his arms. Before sitting back down.  
“哈，我从未如此充满活力。”他说着张开双臂。随后又坐了回去。

They dealt another hand, and beyond all odds.  
他们又发了一手牌，出乎所有人的意料。

"YES!" Asuka cried, as her pair of aces beat Shinji's pair of eights. "FINALLY!"  
"太好了！" 明日香欢呼道，她的两张 A 终于打败了真嗣的两张 8。"终于赢了！"

"Alright, darling. You got more than you bargained for." Shinji said, standing up and stripping his socks and shirt. All while doing his own dance that emphasized his chest, muscles, and…..mentionables. It left Asuka's jaw hanging down.  
"好吧，亲爱的。你得到的可比你预想的要多。" 真嗣说着，站起身来脱掉袜子和衬衫。他一边跳着自己的舞蹈，一边展示着他的胸肌、肌肉和……私密部位。这让明日香的下巴都快掉下来了。

"Damn, since when have you gotten so fit?"  
"该死，你什么时候变得这么健壮了？"

"Training." he said while giving her a sexy look.  
"锻炼呗。" 他说着，向她投去一个性感的眼神。

"Oh, well, keep working out. And remember, push past your limit to get the best result." she then winked.  
"哦，好吧，继续努力。记住，要突破自己的极限才能达到最佳效果。" 她随后眨了眨眼。

"Alright, deal a new hand."  
"好吧，发新牌。"

They played another, and then.  
他们又玩了一局，然后。

"WOO! DOUBLE!" Asuka shouted and stuck her hands up. Because of that, her blanket nearly fell off. She caught it just in time, and gave Shinji a semi-judgeful glance. He saw right through it, as he laid his pair of fours down next to Asuka's pair of tens.  
"哇！双倍！" 明日香喊道，双手举起。由于这个动作，她的毯子差点滑落。她及时抓住了毯子，并给了真嗣一个半带责备的眼神。他一眼就看穿了，将自己的四对放在明日香十对旁边。

Shinji paid back Asuka for before, by throwing his undershirt on her face. Asuka couldn't help, but giggle as she flung that shirt off her face. To see him strip off his pants, seeing every part of him that she wanted to see from the beginning.  
真嗣为了之前的事回报明日香，将他的背心扔到她脸上。明日香忍不住咯咯笑起来，把那件背心从脸上甩开。看到他脱掉裤子，从头到脚每一个她从一开始就想看的地方。

"Alright, one more and you get to see everything." Shinji teased her.  
"好了，再来一次，你就能看到全部了。" 真嗣逗弄她。

"Like I haven't before?" she said while dealing out the hand to decide it all.  
"难道我以前没看过吗？" 她一边说着，一边伸出手来决定这一切。

They couldn't have played through it quicker. Laying down their cards at almost light speed. To reveal….  
他们不可能更快地打完这一局了。几乎以光速放下手中的牌。揭晓的是……

"Damn." both of them said, as they looked down. Asuka had a full house, three threes and two tens. Only for it to be outdone by Shinji's four of a kind….Aces.  
“该死。”两人同时说道，低头看着。明日香有一副葫芦，三个三和两个十。结果却被真嗣的四条……四个 A 给压过了。

"What are the odds of that?" Shinji asked.  
“这概率有多高？”真嗣问道。

"Probably the same as us getting together." Asuka jokes.  
"大概和我们在一起的情况差不多吧。" 明日香开玩笑说。

"Don't say that...you make it seem like we were destined to be alone forever."  
"别说得那么悲观……你这样好像我们注定要孤独终老似的。"

"Oh, I never intended it like that and you know it." she said while grabbing his hand and pulling him in for another deep kiss. The two stayed like that, standing up to pull them closer to each other. They broke for a minute to look into each other's eyes. Then Asuka broke the silence.  
"哦，我可不是那个意思，你知道的。" 她说着，抓住他的手，拉近他再次深深地吻了上去。两人就这样站着，彼此贴近。他们分开片刻，凝视着对方的眼睛。随后，明日香打破了沉默。

"Come to bed Shinji, it's cold without you next to me."  
"来床上吧，真嗣，没有你在我身边，这里冷得要命。"

"Like I would ever leave you alone."  
"我怎么可能让你一个人孤单。"

Asuka gripped Shinji's hand and pulled him into their bedroom. And in the beautiful midnight glow of the moonlight. Shinji gazed upon the most beautiful sight in the world. The blanket flew off, and Asuka fell onto the bed. Her body was that of an Angel, and Shinji was the embodiment of everything she wanted. A strong and gentle soul, there to warm her and keep the nightmares away.  
明日香紧紧握住真嗣的手，将他拉进他们的卧室。在月光那美丽的午夜光辉中，真嗣凝视着世界上最美的景象。被子被掀开，明日香倒在床上。她的身躯宛如天使，而真嗣则是她所渴望的一切化身——一个坚强而温柔的灵魂，来温暖她，驱走梦魇。

They embraced again, through the covers over themselves. Aside from the sweet moans and cries of ecstasy. The two could only really say a couple things to each other.  
他们在被子下再次相拥，除了甜蜜的呻吟和欢愉的呼喊，两人只能彼此说上几句话。

"I love you so much." and "I know, I love you too."  
“我非常爱你。”和“我知道，我也爱你。”

**Epilogue 尾声**

Shinji woke up around sunrise. And was met with a sight he hoped he would never see again. The other side of the bed was empty. Every time this happened, he always questioned that if the last few years. Was the best dream he had ever had. He sighed, then flipped around to see Asuka standing in sunlight, looking out the window, wearing his shirt….and only his shirt. Her skin was shining in the morning light.  
真嗣在日出时分醒来，眼前的一幕是他希望永远不会再看到的。床的另一侧空无一人。每当这种情况发生，他总是怀疑过去几年的时光是否只是他做过的最美的一场梦。他叹了口气，然后翻身看到明日香站在阳光下，望着窗外，穿着他的衬衫……而且只穿着他的衬衫。她的肌肤在晨光中闪耀着光芒。

She noticed him, and was about to walk over. Though he held up his hand to stop her. She looked at him confused.  
她注意到他，正要走过来。但他举起手示意她停下。她困惑地看着他。

"Stay there." “待在那儿。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because the way you were standing was the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. And I don't have a camera on me, so I want to engrave it in my mind."  
"因为你站立的姿态是我见过的最美的景象。我身上没有带相机，所以我想把它刻在脑海里。"

A loving smile spread across her face, as she reached down to unbutton her shirt.  
她脸上绽放出温柔的微笑，伸手解开衬衫的扣子。

"Let's make sure you remember it fully." she said while dropping his shirt to the floor. Then striking a sexy pose. She got the results she wanted, as Shinji's lizard brain kicked in. She squealed in anticipation as he jumped out of bed, wrapped his arms around her and pulled her down to their bed for another round.  
""让我们确保你完全记住它。"" 她说着，将他的衬衫扔到地板上，然后摆出一个性感的姿势。她得到了想要的结果，因为真嗣的本能被激发了。她兴奋地尖叫起来，他跳下床，用双臂环抱住她，将她拉到床上，准备再来一轮。

Breakfast came late that day, and those cards from last night were still on the floor.  
那天早餐来得晚，昨晚的那些卡片还散落在地板上。

**FINALLY! I'M DONE! You guys have no idea how long that took. I'll try working on a new long running story, or work on that Corrin x Felicia story I made. Though who knows with me.  
终于！我完成了！你们不知道这花了多长时间。我可能会开始一个新的长篇故事，或者继续我写的那个科林和菲利西亚的故事。不过，谁知道我会不会坚持下去呢。**

**As always… 一如既往……**
