**************************************************************************************  
  
What was to become of him. He had no idea, as he sat in the darkened room. The door was locked, no matter how many times he tried to break it open. The door wouldn't budge.  
他将何去何从。他坐在昏暗的房间里，一无所知。门被锁上了，无论他尝试多少次破门而出，门都纹丝不动。  
  
He could hear her screams, comming from somewhere down the hall. He had no idea what they where doing to her. Images found their way into his mind. He forced them away. Her screams became louder, covering his ears couldn't block out the sound.Suddenly the screams, the crys for help stopped. Was she dead, had they finally killed her, he thought.  
他能听到她的尖叫声，从走廊的某个地方传来。他不知道他们对她做了什么。脑海中浮现出各种画面，他强迫自己不去想。她的尖叫声越来越大，捂住耳朵也无法隔绝那声音。突然，尖叫声和求救声停止了。她死了吗，他们终于杀了她吗，他心想。  
  
Foot steps echoed down the hall, and they where comming closer. He could make out the sound of something or someone being dragged. He could hear the key in the lock begin to turn. He froze not knowing if they were now comming for him,The door opened, They slug her body in, as if it was just a bag of rubbish. they locked the door again before heading away.  
脚步声在走廊回响，而且越来越近。他能听到有什么东西或某人被拖动的声音。他听到锁孔里钥匙转动的声音。他僵住了，不知道他们是否现在要来找他。门开了，他们像扔垃圾袋一样把她的身体扔了进来，然后再次锁上门，离开了。  
  
He looked at the limp body, before him. Not knowing if any life remained in it. He heard a faint noise, a wince of pain. He saw her trying with all the strength that was left in her body, to sit up. He quickly moved over, using his own body to prop her up. She turned and looked him in the eyes.  
他看着眼前那具瘫软的身体，不知其中是否还残留着生命。他听到一声微弱的呻吟，是痛苦的抽搐。他看到她竭尽残存的力量，试图坐起身来。他迅速上前，用自己的身体支撑着她。她转过头，目光与他相遇。  
  
Blood and dirt covered her face. Her hair used to be shiny flamming red. Was now dull, matted and covered in sweat. He could feel that she was cold. He pulled the blanket that was nearby, and wrapped it around her delicate frame. Pulling her close. He felt himself trying to put the life back into her. He was helping her in the fight to stay alive. Alive, but for how long, was the question.  
血迹和泥土覆盖了她的脸庞。她曾经闪耀如火焰的红发，如今黯淡无光，纠结成团，满是汗水。他能感觉到她的寒冷。他拉过附近的毯子，裹住她纤弱的身躯，紧紧拥她入怀。他感到自己在努力为她注入生命力。他在帮助她与生存的斗争中坚持下去。活着，但能坚持多久，这是个问题。

---
He felt he go limp, but steady shallow breathing indicated that she was still alive, but had fallen asleep from exchustion. He held her close, as if trying to protect her, but from what? He had no idea what these people, if thats what you could call them wanted. What signifiance could they hold.  
他感觉自己快要瘫软，但平稳的浅呼吸表明她仍活着，只是因疲惫而入睡。他紧紧抱着她，仿佛试图保护她，但究竟要防备什么？他完全不知道这些人——如果可以称之为人的话——想要什么。他们又能有什么重要性呢？  
  
  
  
Images ran through his mind of how it all happened. He remembered that he was walking to school, and how she teased him on the way. They where about half way there, when a black van pulled up, and tried to pull them in. He remembered how she fought them off, grabbing him by the arm and ran for school. But their pursuers never gave up, and hunted them down like animals. They not far left to run, when the lights went out. Knowing now that they'd used tranquiliters, to knock them out. Because the next thing he could remember was waking up in this forsaken room. Seeing her curled up in the courner, with a look he thought he would never see on her face. It was a look of complete and utter fear.  
一幕幕画面在他脑海中闪过，关于这一切是如何发生的。他记得自己正走向学校，她一路上还逗弄他。当他们走到一半时，一辆黑色货车突然停下，试图将他们拉进去。他记得她如何奋力抵抗，抓住他的手臂向学校跑去。但追捕者并未放弃，像猎物一样追捕他们。就在他们几乎无路可逃时，灯光突然熄灭。现在他知道他们使用了镇静剂来让他们昏迷。因为他接下来记得的就是在这个被诅咒的房间里醒来，看到她蜷缩在角落，脸上带着他以为永远不会在她脸上看到的表情——那是完全彻底的恐惧。  
  
A shudder swept across his body. Which caused the sleeping girl in his arms to speak in her sleep.  
他全身一阵颤抖，这让怀中熟睡的女孩在梦中喃喃自语。  
  
"Five more minutes please Misato" Misato, a smile found its way inside. He knew that at least one person on this planet would be looking for them. He could imagine her face, when she finds out that section two weren't doing there job. In a sad way it brought him some comfort. But what gave him the most comfort, was having her in his arms, at leat she was with him right now.  
“再五分钟就好，美里。”美里，一丝微笑悄然浮现。他知道，至少这个星球上有一个人会寻找他们。他能想象到她发现第二区的人失职时的表情。在某种悲哀的意义上，这给他带来了些许安慰。但最让他感到安慰的，是此刻她在他怀中，至少她现在与他同在。  
  
Loud footsteps aroused him from his sleep. The footsteps where comming closer to the door. Panic swept through his mind. Looking down at the girl in his arms.He knew she couldn't withstand another round of whatever they had instore. So laying her down on the straw bed. He stept forward somehow finding the courage to take brunt of what they had in store. He could feel his body trembling. As the door opened infront of him. A tall dark man stood infront of him. though he couldn't quite make out the mans face.  
响亮的脚步声将他从睡梦中惊醒。脚步声越来越接近门口。恐慌席卷了他的思绪。低头看着怀中的女孩，他知道她无法承受他们即将带来的新一轮折磨。于是，他将她轻轻放在稻草床上，鼓起勇气，准备独自承受即将到来的一切。他感到自己的身体在颤抖。当门在他面前打开时，一个高大黑暗的男人站在他面前，虽然他看不清那人的脸。  
  
"Come with me" The man demanded, something in the man's voice told him that it would be better to obay than to argue. Taking one look back at the reason he was doing this, before stepping forward.  
“跟我来。”那人命令道，他的语气让男孩明白，服从比争辩更为明智。他回头看了一眼自己这样做的原因，然后迈步向前。  
  
"Please sit down" the man jestered towards a quite menasing looking chair. As he took his seat the man continued. "Well Mr Shinji Ikari, as you know we spoke to your friend yesterday, May I ask have you spoken to her yet?"  
"请坐"，那人指着一把看起来颇具威胁性的椅子开玩笑地说道。他坐下后，那人继续说道："那么，碇真嗣先生，如你所知，我们昨天和你的朋友谈过了，请问你和她谈过了吗？"  
  
"No She hasn't said a word" the man thought about this for a moment.  
"没有，她一句话也没说"，那人对此沉思了一会儿。  
  
"Well let me put this simply, you can answer my questions. Or you can do it the hard way, like you friend did. I'm sure you heard how uncomfortable we can make you." Sounds of her screams filled his mind, but he didn't move a muscle, not wanting to give away his feelings. "I take it that we have an understanding" Silence just filled the room.  
"好吧，让我说得简单点，你可以选择回答我的问题，或者像你的朋友那样，用困难的方式。我确信你听说了我们能让你多么不舒服。"她的尖叫声在他脑海中回荡，但他一动不动，不想暴露自己的情绪。"我想我们达成了共识"，房间里只有沉默弥漫。  
  
"Shall we begin. Tell me what you know about NERV?"  
"我们开始吧。告诉我你对 NERV 了解多少？"  
  
"It's an organisation that was set-up after the second impact to defeat the angels" The man smiled seaming pleased that the boy was co-operating.  
"它是在第二次冲击后成立的组织，目的是击败使徒。" 男人微笑着，似乎对男孩的合作感到满意。  
  
"Good, thats good. You're the pilot of Unit one aren't you?" The boy just nodded in conformation. "And you are Commander Ikari's son" again the boy just nodded. "Then tell me what's has your father got planned for Unit one and his humanity project?"  
"很好，这很好。你是零号机的驾驶员对吧？" 男孩只是点头确认。"而你是碇司令的儿子" 男孩再次点头。"那么告诉我，你父亲对零号机和他的人类补完计划有什么打算？"  
  
"I have no idea what your talking about I've no idea what this project is"  
"我完全不知道你在说什么，我也不知道这个项目是什么"  
  
"Really then perhaps can tell me what's so special about Unit one"  
"真的吗？那或许你能告诉我，初号机有什么特别之处"  
  
"Nothing it's just an Eva. Unit two is the production model don't you want to know about that" The man seamed to be getting angry, about the lack on information he was getting. The man walked up to the boy and placed a vertual headset over his eyes. Images of people he knew, Misato, Hikari, Rei, Toji,Kensuke, flashed before his eyes.  
"没什么特别的，它只是一台 EVA。二号机才是量产型号，你不想了解一下吗？" 那人似乎因为得不到足够的信息而变得愤怒。他走到男孩面前，将一副虚拟现实头盔戴在他的眼睛上。他熟悉的人们的影像，美里、光、绫波、真嗣、健介，在他眼前闪过。  
  
"We know where these people live, we are also aware how important to you they are. If you don't tell us what we want to know. Then these people will start to die, untill we find out what we want" He couldn't stand it no matter what he was going to say people would start loosing their eyes.  
"我们知道这些人的住处，也清楚他们对你有多重要。如果你不告诉我们想知道的，那么这些人就会开始死去，直到我们找到答案为止。" 无论他怎么决定，他都无法忍受人们开始失去眼睛的情景。  
  
"I don't know" Another set of picture now flashed before his eyes. Picture that showed his friends, dead with their throats cut or with gunshot wounds.  
"我不知道" 又一组照片在他眼前闪过，照片上显示他的朋友们，有的喉咙被割开，有的中枪身亡。  
  
"Tell me what is special about Unit one, or we'll be forced to make this happen" Terror now showed in his voice.  
"告诉我一号单位有什么特别之处，否则我们将不得不让这一切发生。" 他的声音中现在充满了恐惧。  
  
"I don't know anything about Unit one, just how to pilot it" More images came into view, of children, women, and men. he had no idea of who they where, but they where shown in similar situations as his friends. He could feel the tears form in his eyes.  
"我对一号单位一无所知，只知道如何驾驶它。" 更多的图像映入眼帘，有孩子、女人和男人。他不知道他们是谁，但他们被展示在与他朋友相似的情境中。他感到泪水在眼眶中形成。  
  
"Please stop I've told you all I know. I don't know anything my father has always kept me in the dark. But images were there flashing before his eyes.  
"请停下来，我已经告诉了你们我所知道的一切。我对我父亲的事情一无所知，他总是让我蒙在鼓里。但图像就在眼前闪现。  
  
It felt like hours, no matter how much he pleaded with them to stop. The images just kept on comming. Slowly draining his energy.  
感觉像是过了几个小时，无论他如何恳求他们停止。图像只是不断涌现，慢慢地消耗着他的精力。  
  
"I don't know please stop, please." As if his prayer where answered the images stopped. And the visor was removed. No more words were exchanged. Somehow finding the strength in his legs, he was lead back to his cell.  
"我不知道，请停下来，求你了。" 仿佛他的祈祷得到了回应，那些影像停止了。面罩也被取下。没有更多的言语交流。不知怎的，他在双腿中找到了力量，被带回了他的牢房。  
  
When he returned to his cell he was tried and exchusted. He fell to his knees, once the door was locked again.  
当他回到牢房时，他已经筋疲力尽。门再次上锁后，他跪倒在地。  
  
"Shinji are you ok?" She ran to his side covering both of them with the blanket.  
"真嗣，你还好吗？" 她跑到他身边，用毯子盖住了他们俩。  
  
"I'm ok Asuka. I just need to rest" With that he laid down on the straw bed. Asuka looked on.  
“我没事，明日香。我只是需要休息一下。”说完，他便躺在了稻草床上。明日香在一旁看着。

Author's notes For those reading my other story Finding one in many do not fear I haven't abandoned it, I've just had a few ideas for other fics, and I wanted to start writing them. So keep your eye out for them. Any way you maybe wondering why I used visual torture, well these two are pritty messed up in the head really when you actually thinking about it. So a method of torture that got inside their mind was going to be more effective I thought which is why I used it.  
作者笔记：对于正在阅读我的另一部作品《在众多中寻找一个》的读者们，请不要担心，我没有放弃它，只是有了一些其他故事的想法，想要开始动笔。所以请留意这些新作。或许你们会好奇为什么我采用了视觉折磨，实际上，这两个人在精神上相当混乱，当你深入思考时就会发现。我认为一种能深入他们内心的折磨方式会更加有效，这就是我选择它的原因。

"What!" Misato slambed her fists down onto her desk. "How come Section two wasn't doing their job again?" Collapsing back into her chair, she crossed her legs and thought for a momnet.  
“什么！” 美里猛地将拳头砸在桌子上。“第二分部怎么又没做好他们的工作？”她瘫坐在椅子上，跷起二郎腿，沉思片刻。  
  
'This means that we have only one pilot' Opening her eyes she glared at the NERV agent standing in front of her. "How do you expect Rei to handle this on her own?" The agent swallowed haed, the look in Misato's eyes where making him very uncomfortable. "What if there's an Angel attack?"  
“这意味着我们只有一个驾驶员。”她睁开眼睛，瞪着站在她面前的 NERV 特工。“你指望丽一个人怎么应付这种情况？”特工咽了口唾沫，美里眼中的神情让他感到非常不安。“如果有使徒来袭怎么办？”  
  
"Errr" was all the Agent could manage before being pounced on.  
“呃……”特工还没来得及说更多，就被打断了。  
  
"I surgest that you find them pritty quickly. May I also surgest that you start with their school route. As you can see the headmaster informed me that they never showed up for class. Which if you where doing your job correctly. You would know about it wouldn't you. DISMISSED" Though sheer fear and relief to be allowed out of her sight. The agent marched out of the office as fast as he could.  
“我建议你尽快找到他们。另外，我建议你从他们的学校路线开始。如你所见，校长告诉我他们从未到校上课。如果你正确履行职责，你应该知道这一点，不是吗？退下。” 在极度的恐惧和被允许离开的庆幸中，特工尽可能快地走出了办公室。  
  
Relaxing back into her chair, Misato looked down at the two files infront of her. Their names and faces looked back at her. Worry and concern spread accross her mind But it wasn't just that of NERV tatics that concerned her. Living with the two of them had brought them close. She had started to see them as her children, and now she was concerned for them as a mother should be.  
米莎托靠回椅背，低头看着面前的两份档案。他们的名字和面孔回望着她。担忧和关切在她心中蔓延，但这不仅仅是 NERV 策略的担忧。与他们共同生活使他们变得亲密。她开始将他们视为自己的孩子，现在她像一个母亲应该做的那样为他们担心。  
  
'Oh Asuka , Shinji. Where are you? What's happened to you?' with that thought the phone rang.  
“哦，明日香，真嗣。你们在哪里？你们发生了什么？” 就在这个念头闪过时，电话铃响了。  
  
"Hello. You found what. Their school bags. Keep looking" Replacing the reciever, she knew it was at least a start. But what worried her even more, is that they hadn't ran away, something else had happened, and it frightened her.  
“你好。你找到了什么？他们的书包。继续找。”她放下电话，知道至少这是个开始。但更让她担忧的是，他们并没有逃跑，而是发生了别的事情，这让她感到害怕。  
  
Asuka looked on as Shinji laid on the straw bed, clearly exchusted. She had given him their only blanket. She sat in the corner with her knees pulled up to her chest. Her uniform was torn from the struggle. when she was interigated. She looked on at Shinji's sleeping form, wondering if he knew the answers to the questions that they wanted to know. What was so speical about unit one. She wasn't the pilot. In a way it she was hurt that they didn't want to know about her unit two. Then agian all she could tell them is what she was told herself, and she told that to Shinji when they first met on the carrier Over the Rainbow. this made her relise that she didn't know anything about NERV or the evangelions. Apart from what NERV wanted her to know.  
明日香看着真嗣躺在稻草床上，显然已经筋疲力尽。她把自己的唯一一条毯子给了他。她蜷缩在角落里，膝盖紧贴着胸口。她的制服在审讯中被撕破了。她凝视着真嗣的睡脸，想知道他是否知道那些他们想知道的答案。初号机到底有什么特别之处。她不是那个驾驶员。某种程度上，她感到受伤，因为他们不想了解她的二号机。然而，她能告诉他们的只是她自己被告知的事情，就像她第一次在“彩虹之上”号航母上遇到真嗣时告诉他的那样。这让她意识到，她对 NERV 或福音战士一无所知，除了 NERV 想让她知道的那部分。  
  
The thought of Shinji possibly knowing more than her angered her. For he had only been with NERV for eight months now. While she, well it's all she really known from the age of five. Asuka knew that she would have to put her differences aside for now. For if they wanted to stay alive and in one piece, they would have to work together, as a team.  
想到真嗣可能比自己知道得更多，她感到愤怒。毕竟他只在 NERV 待了八个月。而她，从五岁起就只知道这些。明日香知道她现在必须暂时放下分歧。因为如果他们想活下去并且完好无损，他们就必须作为一个团队合作。  
  
Opening the door to the apartment after a days work at NERV. Deadly silence greated her.  
在 NERV 工作了一天后打开公寓的门，迎接她的是死一般的寂静。  
  
"I'm home" no reply greated her. Usually by now a chaos of voices would call out to her. Ringing through out the appartment. The only thing that was there to welcome her home was a quiet hot spring penguin.  
“我回来了”，没有回应迎接她。通常这时候会有一片嘈杂的声音呼唤她，响彻整个公寓。唯一欢迎她回家的，是一只安静的热泉企鹅。  
  
"hi ya Penpen" "嗨，佩佩"  
  
Misato sat at the kitchen table in her causals. Looking at the first can of beer. She opened two hours agao. It just didn't seam right for her to enjoy her beer. When Asuka and Shinji could be God knows where. She picked up the can, and poured it down the sink.  
美里穿着便装坐在厨房的餐桌旁，盯着两个小时前打开的第一罐啤酒。当明日香和真嗣可能不知身在何处时，她觉得独自享受啤酒并不合适。她拿起那罐啤酒，倒进了水槽。  
  
"I won't have another drink untill Asuka and Shinji are safely home."  
"在明日香和真嗣安全回家之前，我不会再来一杯了。"  
  
**************************************************************************************  
  
Author's note; I know its short but I just wanted to get Misato into the story. and don't you find it scarey that she's not having her beer. I do.  
作者的话；我知道它很短，但我只是想让美里进入故事。你不觉得她没喝啤酒很吓人吗？我确实这么觉得。

### Comment
[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C): you have a nice plot here (besides a few continuity issues), but it'd be much easier to understand if you used some sort of divider to break up the scenes. Also I noticed that one moment Asuka is nearly dead and the next moment she's walking about like she's perfectly healed again. And why did they hurt Asuka so much in their interigation and not lay a finger upon Shinji? It doesn't quite add up in my opinion. Still the general concept of the story is solid.  
你在这里有一个很好的情节（除了一些连续性问题），但如果你使用某种分隔线来分解场景，它会更容易理解。我还注意到，前一刻明日香几乎死了，下一刻她又像完全痊愈了一样走来走去。为什么他们在审讯中如此伤害明日香，却不对真嗣指手画脚？在我看来，这并不完全加起来。尽管如此，这个故事的总体概念还是很扎实的。

[Black Robed One](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/147928/Black-Robed-One): A rather short, but still interesting chapter. The part about Misato's dialogue with Section 2 agent makes me suspect, that Section 2 is somehow involved in Asuka and Shinji's kindnaping (Betrayal within ranks?), for as far as I remember, Section 2 agents are quite professional, and there is NO WAY for them to be as incompentent and ignorant as you discribed, unless they want to appear this way in order to cover up their lack of to find Asuka and Shinji, and to prevent kindnaping in the first place. Anyway, keep your good writing, asuka-uk! I am egarly waiting for the next chapter of this story of yours!  
一个相当短，但仍然很有趣chapter.关于美里与第 2 节特工的对话的部分让我怀疑，第 2 节以某种方式参与了明日香和真嗣的同类（队伍内部的背叛？），因为据我所知，第 2 节特工非常专业，他们不可能像你描述的那样不顺从和无知，除非他们想以这种方式出现以掩盖他们找不到明日香和真嗣， 并首先防止打盹。无论如何，保持你的好写作，明日香英国！我正在等待你的下一个chapter故事！
