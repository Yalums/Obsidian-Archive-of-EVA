### "The Ikari Family" “碇家”

Even after months of seeing it herself firsthand, it was still an unusual sight in her eyes, watching Shinji and Asuka being together and not just as a couple of newfound lovers but acting as a proper young married couple.  
即便亲眼目睹了几个月，在她看来，这仍是一幕不同寻常的景象——看着真嗣和明日香在一起，不仅仅是作为一对新晋恋人，而是像一对真正的年轻夫妇那样相处。

But now right as she was sitting down in the kitchen area of the apartment in the late evening while drinking her fresh cup of coffee, her mind was still processing a more strange and a more unusual sight she had been seeing in the last couple of days. Seeing both her charges being dotting and loving parents to their three year old daughter Aki.  
但现在，正当她在傍晚时分坐在公寓的厨房区，啜饮着刚煮好的咖啡时，她的脑海中仍在处理着这几天看到的更为奇怪、更为不寻常的景象。看着她的两位被监护人，对他们的三岁女儿明希展现出无微不至、充满爱意的父母之态。

"NOOOOOO!"

The said daughter who was now currently in the bathroom, being forced to take a her long awaited bath by her father.  
那位被提到的女儿，此刻正被迫在浴室里洗她期待已久的澡，这一切都是她父亲的安排。

"Aki, come on, please stop struggling," Shinji said, clearly he was struggling himself from the sounds in the bathroom that the two women could hear. The sound of water splashing around could be heard soon after.  
“Aki，快点，请别再挣扎了，”真嗣说道，显然他自己也从浴室传来的声音中感到了挣扎。很快，水花四溅的声音便传了出来。

Misato looking towards Asuka who was currently washing the dishes from the dinner everyone had before. Or at least, she was doing her best, considering that while no longer in a sling, her left shoulder hadn't fully recovered from her phantom pain she experienced in the last battle.  
美里看向明日香，她正在清洗晚餐后大家用过的碗碟。至少，她正在尽力而为，考虑到尽管不再需要吊带，她的左肩在上次战斗中经历的幻痛还未完全恢复。

"Jeez you weren't kidding. The kid really doesn't like taking baths does she." Misato stated, remembering the conversations she had with Asuka about the little girl before.  
“天哪，你没开玩笑。这孩子真的不喜欢洗澡，对吧。”美里说道，回想起之前与明日香关于这个小女孩的对话。

Sighing heavily as she did her best at the dishes, Asuka could only look at the older woman with a tired yet genuine smile. "Oh believe me it gets much worse as this is just the start of getting her in the bath. Give it a minute and she'll really put up a struggle when trying to wash her.  
明日香叹了口气，尽力洗着碗，只能疲惫却真诚地对年长的女性笑了笑。“哦，相信我，这还只是让她进浴缸的开始，再过一会儿，她真的会拼命挣扎，不愿意洗。”

Misato just chuckled at this. "That bad huh?"  
美里对此只是轻声笑了笑。“这么糟糕啊？”

"Oh yes and after she's had her bath the next battle is trying to get her to properly brush her teeth. The payoff is when that's all done she'll be too tuckered out that when reading her a bedtime story she'll be out like a light before the tale is halfway over."  
“哦，是的，给她洗完澡后，下一场战斗就是设法让她好好刷牙。回报就是，这一切完成后，她会累得不行，读睡前故事给她听时，她还没听到一半就呼呼大睡了。”

Misato laughed slightly at Asuka's detail description of what tonight's events would be. The fact that this was a recurring thing for the small family just made it more funnier in her eyes.  
听到明日香详细描述今晚的活动，美里轻声笑了。对这小家庭来说，这种事屡见不鲜，在她眼里反而更显趣味。

Misato couldn't help but be truly happy for Shinji and Asuka, who after enduring the pain of the thought of never seeing their daughter again only to be reunited when the war was finally over was a miracle in itself. What also surprised Misato was when she was told that it was Rei Ayanami herself that not only found Aki but took care of the child and brought her back to Asuka and Shinji.  
美里不禁为真嗣和明日香感到由衷的高兴，他们经历了那种痛苦，以为再也见不到女儿，却在战争结束后奇迹般重聚。更让美里惊讶的是，她得知是绫波零不仅找到了爱子，还照顾她并把她带回了明日香和真嗣身边。

Also remembering when she was presented to the young girl by her parents, after her shock she tried to greet Aki but the child became incredibly shy, much to the surprise of her parents, hiding behind her mother's leg at first and only coming out after being reassured by her parents that Misato was a friend.  
还记得她第一次被父母介绍给小女孩时的情景，震惊过后她试图向 Aki 打招呼，但孩子变得异常害羞，这让她的父母大为惊讶，起初躲在母亲身后，直到父母再三保证 Misato 是朋友，才慢慢走出来。

To further reassure the little girl as well as be less intimidating, Misato went down on her knees at Aki's level and introduced herself to her, even telling Aki to call her 'Auntie Misato', a title she now did kind of regretted giving herself, though none the less it worked and Aki became more open towards the older woman and Misato clearly could see the hyperactive energy that Asuka had spoken of to her before.  
为了进一步安抚小女孩，减少她的紧张感，Misato 蹲下身来与 Aki 平视，并自我介绍，甚至让 Aki 称呼她为‘Misato 阿姨’，这个称呼她现在有点后悔自封了，但不管怎样，这招奏效了，Aki 对这位年长女性敞开了心扉，Misato 明显能感受到 Asuka 之前向她描述的那种活泼能量。

Before Misato could continue her train of thought both her and Asuka heard a great splash of water from the bathroom, followed shortly by Shinji cry of distress. Misato also saw Asuka sigh and began to walk towards the bathroom.  
在 Misato 继续思考之前，她和 Asuka 都听到了浴室里传来巨大的水花声，紧接着是 Shinji 的惊叫。Misato 还看到 Asuka 叹了口气，开始向浴室走去。

"Shinji, is everything ok in there?" Asuka said before she was opening the bathroom door.  
"真嗣，里面一切都好吗？" 明日香说着，打开了浴室的门。

"Asuka, wait! Don't open the...arg door!" Shinji tried to warn her but unfortunately the warning came too late.  
"明日香，等等！别打开...啊门！" 真嗣试图警告她，但不幸的是，警告来得太迟了。

"YAAAY FREEDOM!" Aki shouted while running out of the bathroom naked just as her mother opened the door, only thick bath bubbles still covering her hair and body as she ran out.  
"耶，自由啦！" 阿基一边喊着，一边赤裸着从浴室跑出来，正好在她妈妈开门的时候，只有厚厚的泡沫还覆盖着她的头发和身体，她就这样跑了出来。

Shocked for a few seconds after seeing her daughter run out past her, Asuka then quickly proceed to chase after the little girl.  
看到女儿从身边跑过，震惊了几秒后，明日香迅速追了上去。

"Hey, you get back here right now, kleines Fräulein."  
"嘿，你马上给我回来，小小姐。"

"Noooo!" Was the only reply back to her Mama. Still running about the apartment all while dodging her mother's attempt to catch her. Eventually Shinji joined in the chase soon after wiping away the soapy water from his eyes with a towel.  
"不要！" 这是她对妈妈唯一的回应。她仍在公寓里四处奔跑，躲避着母亲试图抓住她的尝试。最终，真嗣用毛巾擦干眼中的肥皂水后，也加入了追逐。

"Seriously baka, how could you let her escape!?" Asuka asked while still trying to catch Aki.  
"真是笨蛋，你怎么能让她跑掉！？" 明日香一边问，一边还在试图抓住阿基。

"I couldn't help it, she splashed water in my eyes and it was very soapy too." Shinji responded with the excuse.  
"我也没办法，她往我眼睛里泼水，而且还是肥皂水。" 真嗣用借口回应道。

"Honestly Shinji, you had one job," Asuka said while still trying to catch the soapy runaway girl. Eventually she stopped running to catch her breath and then noticed the older purple haired woman wasn't helping in the chase nor showing signs of getting up to help.  
"说真的，真嗣，你只有这一件事要做，" 明日香一边说，一边还在追赶那个浑身泡沫逃跑的女孩。最终她停下来喘口气，然后注意到那位年长的紫发女子既没有帮忙追赶，也没有起身帮忙的迹象。

"A little help here Katsuragi?" Asuka said while catching her breath and at this point Shinji joined the two women at the kitchen table, breathing more heavily then Asuka was and looked like he was about to collapse.  
“这里需要点帮助，葛城吗？”明日香喘着气说道，此时真嗣也加入了两位女士在厨房桌边的行列，他的呼吸比明日香还要急促，看起来快要倒下了。

Misato just looked at her while sipping her coffee, hiding her smirk behind it. "Hey, she's your kid not mine."  
美里只是啜饮着咖啡，目光扫过她，将窃笑藏在杯后。“嘿，她是你女儿，不是我的。”

Asuka's response to that was to give Misato a low growl. "Oh just wait till you start having children, Misato." Asuka started saying before once again restarting the chase to catch their daughter with Shinji, now having recovered his breath to sigh heavily before following his wife.  
明日香对此的回应是对美里低吼一声。“哦，你就等着自己开始养孩子吧，美里。”明日香说着，再次开始了追逐，试图抓住他们的女儿，真嗣此时已恢复了呼吸，重重地叹了口气，随后跟上妻子。

Till I start having children huh, Misato thought. Taking in Asuka and Shinji was one thing, with them being teenage kids but she had zero experience with actual children let alone babies and the thought of motherhood terrified her. Memories of her own parents and childhood before second impact did not help ease her worries either.  
直到我开始生孩子，是吧，美里想。收养明日香和真嗣是一回事，毕竟他们已经是青少年了，但她对真正的孩子，更别提婴儿，毫无经验，一想到做母亲就让她感到恐惧。她自己父母和童年在第二次冲击前的记忆也没有帮助她缓解担忧。

"Aki Ikari you get out of there this minute, kleines Fräulein!" Asuka's loud voice broke Misato out of her thoughts and the older woman looked up to see that during the chase Aki had somehow gotten into PenPen's fridge and locked herself inside to avoid her parents from catching her.  
“Aki Ikari，你马上从那里出来，小女士！”明日香的大嗓门打断了美里的思绪，年长的女人抬头一看，发现追逐中 Aki 不知怎么地钻进了 PenPen 的冰箱里，把自己锁在里面，以躲避父母抓她。

"No!"

"Aki if you don't come out this instant then there will be no bedti…" Asuka didn't get to finish her sentence as the familiar sound of the doorbell was heard throughout the apartment.  
“Aki，如果你不立刻出来，那么就没有床……”明日香没能说完她的句子，因为公寓里响起了熟悉的门铃声。

"Who could that be at this hour?" Shinji muttered.  
“这么晚了会是谁呢？”真嗣喃喃自语。

"Don't worry I'll get it." Misato announced to the two while getting up from her chair and making her way to the hallway. "Just don't dismantle or break PenPen's fridge trying to get little miss terror out of there ok."  
“别担心，我去开。”美里对两人宣布，同时从椅子上起身，走向走廊。“只是别拆了或弄坏 PenPen 的冰箱，试图把小魔王从那儿弄出来，好吗。”

Finally reaching the door, Misato was pleasantly surprised to see to her lover Ryoji Kaji with his already familiar charming smile.  
终于走到门口，美里惊喜地看到她的恋人加持良治，他那熟悉的迷人微笑依旧。

"Hey Misato." Kaji managed to say before Misato wordlessly threw her arms around him and kissed him deeply for moment before they both pulled back. "Guess you really missed me huh."  
“嘿，美里。”在美里无声地张开双臂紧紧拥抱他并深深一吻之后，两人稍稍分开，“看来你真的很想我呢。”

Misato slightly blushed at that, feeling embarrassed at her spontaneous reaction to seeing him since their 'emotional reunion' at the NERV HQ several days ago. Remembering how she had rushed into Kaji arms upon seeing him again months after his supposed 'death', which lead to her crying on him, slapping him for worrying her to eventually kissing him to finally dragging him to her office for passionate sex.  
听到这话，美里微微脸红，对于自己在几天前 NERV 总部那次‘情感重逢’时见到他后的即兴反应感到尴尬。她回想起几个月前，当她以为他已经‘死去’后再次见到他时，是如何冲进他的怀抱，哭泣着拍打他，责怪他让她担心，最终吻了他，并把他拉到办公室里激情缠绵。

Breaking out of her trip on memory lane she soon enough gave a deep frown towards him and Kaji knew he was in trouble.  
从回忆中抽离出来，她很快对他皱起了眉头，而加持知道麻烦来了。

"Where in the world have you been?" Misato asked interrogating. "You left without a word except a note saying 'I'll be right back' and that was several days ago!"  
“你到底跑哪儿去了？”美里质问道，“你一声不吭就走了，只留下一张纸条说‘我马上回来’，可那已经是好几天前的事了！”

Kaji sighed while rubbing his hand behind his neck. "Sorry about that Misato, had to take care of a few lose ends with the JSSDF as well as the situation with the prime minister, so I'm sorry for leaving you unexpectedly like that."  
加持叹了口气，揉了揉后颈，“抱歉，美里，我得处理一些自卫队的遗留问题，还有首相那边的事，所以很抱歉这样突然离开你。”

Giving him a puzzled look at the mention of the prime minister, Misato had to ask. "Wait, what about the prime minister?"  
听到首相这个词，美里一脸困惑地问：“等等，首相怎么了？”

Before Kaji could tell her, small footsteps were heard, quickly coming from within the apartment.  
在加治能告诉她之前，一阵细碎的脚步声传来，迅速从公寓内部接近。

"Mister Kaji you're here!"  
“加治先生，您来了！”

Both of the older adults looked back in the apartment only to see Aki staring back in the entrance hallway still slightly wet with a few thick bubbles covering her small body.  
两位年长者回头望向公寓内，只见秋正站在入口的过道里，身上还带着些许湿润，几团厚厚的泡沫覆盖在她娇小的身躯上。

The sight of seeing the kid again was enough to give Kaji a momentary look of confusion while Misato had a slight panic look on her face. How was she gonna explain the whole Ikari family situation with him?  
再次见到那孩子，足以让加持脸上闪过一丝困惑，而美里则显得有些慌张。她该如何向他解释整个碇家的情况呢？

Just as Misato was trying to figure out what to say, Aki was quickly grabbed from behind by Asuka, making the little girl shriek in surprise.  
正当美里试图想出该说什么时，明被身后的明日香迅速抓住，小姑娘惊叫出声。

"Got you!" Asuka said triumphantly while slightly out of breath. "You are gonna finish your bath kleines Fräulein and then you will brush your….Kaji!"  
“抓到你了！”明日香得意地说道，微微喘着气。“你得洗完澡，小小姐，然后刷牙……加持！”

Shinji who was once again more out of breath than Asuka just arrived behind her and also saw the older unshaven man and was just as surprised and happy to physically see him alive again too.  
再次比明日香喘得更厉害的真嗣，紧随其后赶到她身边，也看到了那位未修边幅的年长男子，同样惊讶且高兴地再次亲眼见到他活着。

After a brief pause of confusion, Kaji's face changed to that of his classic charming smile. "So are you kids finally gonna let me in on the big secret?"  
短暂的困惑停顿后，加持的脸上换上了他那经典的迷人微笑。“所以，你们这些孩子终于打算让我知道那个大秘密了吗？”

x-x-x-x-x-x

After the event in the hallway, everyone agreed to take the conversation back into the kitchen as Asuka and Shinji did owe Kaji an explanation but before that, Aki was once again forced to take and finish her bath. While the three year old did once again put a bit of a struggle, this time neither of her parents took any chances and washed her together. Plus, her running around the apartment somewhat tired her out, making the task of cleaning her easier to do.  
在走廊事件之后，大家一致同意将谈话带回厨房，因为明日香和真嗣确实欠加持一个解释。但在那之前，秋又一次被迫去洗澡并完成它。尽管三岁的她再次有些挣扎，但这次她的父母都没有冒险，而是共同为她洗澡。此外，她在公寓里跑来跑去也消耗了一些体力，使得清洁工作变得更容易进行。

After now having washed, dried and making Aki brush her teeth as well as putting the girl to bed (with a short story as compromise – her stunt deserved some form of punishment after all, but neither parent could bring themselves to skip it entirely either) the two members of the Ikari family joined the two older adults at the kitchen table. Though just when they sat down, a very tired Aki came back to remind her parents that she still needed to say her goodnight to everyone present in the apartment. Once she corrected that oversight to everyone's amusement, Shinji tucked her back in before rejoining everyone. At first no one knew what to say for a few minute but the silence was finally broken by Shinji.  
在给 Aki 洗漱、吹干头发并让她刷牙后，还将她哄上床（用一个简短的故事作为妥协——毕竟她的恶作剧值得某种惩罚，但两位家长又不忍心完全跳过这一环节），碇家的两位成员才加入厨房桌旁的两位年长者。然而，他们刚坐下，疲惫不堪的 Aki 又回来提醒父母，她还需要向在公寓里的每个人道晚安。她纠正了这个疏忽，逗得大家发笑后，真嗣再次把她安顿好，然后重新加入大家。起初，谁也不知道该说什么，但几分钟后，沉默终于被真嗣打破。

"So Kaji, I guess you read the letter I gave you." Shinji managed to say which earn a slight chuckle from the unshaven man.  
“那么，加持先生，我想你已经读了我给你的信。”真嗣勉强说道，这让那位胡子拉碴的男人轻笑了一声。

"Well to be honest Shinji, at first I threw the letter you gave me in the trash. But in the end my curiosity got the better of me and I did eventually read it. Thanks for the warning by the way, you saved my life." Kaji said, earning a small smile from Shinji.  
“老实说，真嗣，一开始我把那封信扔进了垃圾桶。但最终我的好奇心占了上风，我还是读了。顺便感谢你的警告，你救了我的命。”加持说道，这让真嗣露出了微笑。

"And thanks for helping us. You have no idea what you helped prevent."  
"谢谢你帮助我们。你不知道你帮我们避免了什么。"

"Kaji how much do you know already?" Asuka was able to ask the man.  
"加持，你已经知道多少了？" 明日香能够问这个男人。"

Kaji took a sip of his tea before given his answer. "Well at first I assumed that you two are either time travellers or have some sort of future sight thing going on. But now I'm all for the first since I've meet your kid from the future," Kaji said and his honest answer earned him the surprise looks from all not only Asuka and Shinji but Misato as well.  
加持喝了一口茶，然后给出了他的回答。"嗯，起初我以为你们俩要么是时间旅行者，要么有什么预见未来的能力。但现在我更倾向于前者，因为我见到了你们来自未来的孩子，" 加持说道，他的诚实回答让所有人都露出了惊讶的表情，不仅仅是明日香和真嗣，还有美里。

"Wait, so you knew she was our daughter!?" Asuka said before turning to look at the purpled hair woman next to Kaji. "Did you tell him?"  
"等等，所以你早就知道她是我们女儿！？" 明日香说着转向看向坐在加持旁边的紫发女子。"是你告诉他的吗？"

"I didn't say anything. Nor did I have the chance to say anything to him."  
"我什么都没说。我也没有机会对他说什么。"

Kaji looked at the two pilots. "When I first met her while she was travelling with Rei in the country side, I had a strong feeling but I wasn't a hundred percent sure. But now having seen her here with you and how you two take care of her, loving her as any parents would I'm now most certainly sure that she your kid." Kaji drank the last of his tea before giving another charming look but in Asuka's direction. "Plus that little lady's got your blue eyes, Asuka."  
加持看着两位驾驶员。"当我第一次在乡下遇见她和绫波一起旅行时，我就有种强烈的感觉，但并不完全确定。但现在看到她和你俩在一起，你们像任何父母一样爱她、照顾她，我现在可以肯定她是你们的女儿。" 加持喝完最后一口茶，又向明日香投去一个迷人的眼神。"而且那位小女士继承了你的蓝眼睛，明日香。"

Asuka blushed slightly at that compliment before she smiled. "Thanks."  
听到那句赞美，明日香微微脸红，随即笑了笑。"谢谢。"

Soon after that, Asuka and Shinji told their whole story to Kaji like they had once done to Misato, telling him of what happened in the original timeline, their survival and lives in the post third impact world and how and when they where sent back and their goal to prevent the end of the world to the present now.  
不久之后，明日香和真嗣向加持讲述了他们的全部经历，就像曾经对美里所做的那样，告诉他原时空中发生的事情，他们在第三次冲击后的世界如何生存，以及他们何时被送回，目的是阻止世界末日的到来，直到现在。

By the time they had finished it was well late into the night and everyone went off to bed and for once Kaji decided to stay the night in the apartment. Initially he had planned to sleep on the couch or the living room floor but to his surprise he was more or less pulled by his lover Misato to her room and slept together holding each other.  
当他们讲完时，夜已深沉，大家都去睡觉了。这一次，加持决定在公寓里过夜。他原本打算睡在沙发或客厅地板上，但出乎意料的是，他被恋人美里几乎是拉进了她的房间，两人相拥而眠。

### Chapter 2 Meeting PenPen  
Chapter 2 遇见 PenPen

'Ding dong'

"I'LL GET, I'LL GET IT!" shouted an overly excited Aki as she made her way to the front door of the Katsuragi/Ikari/Soryu apartment, quickly forgetting about the cartoon show she was so engrossed in a second ago.  
“我来开，我来开！”阿基兴奋地大喊着，朝葛城/碇/苍月家的前门走去，转眼间就忘了刚才还全神贯注的卡通节目。

Shinji chuckled at Aki's excitement at answering the door. Ever since discovering the door bell, Aki had begun a habit of wanting to be the first in answer the door.  
真嗣对阿基开门时的兴奋劲儿轻声笑了起来。自从发现了门铃，阿基就养成了总想第一个去开门的习惯。

The first time Aki found out about it was when Misato wanted pizza takeout once many of the fast food places began opening again in the city. The sound of the door bell was such a unique sound to the young girl that soon after, she had once just kept pressing the door bell button until she was chided for it.  
第一次得知这件事是在市内许多快餐店重新开业后，美里想叫披萨外卖的时候。门铃声对小女孩来说是如此独特，以至于不久后，她曾不停地按门铃按钮，直到因此被责备。

Shinji, who was doing laundry immediately stopped what he was doing to follow his little girl to the front door, knowing that once Aki had answered the door and greeted whoever it was she wouldn't know what to do next unless the person at the door was a familiar face to the girl such as Rei or Kaji.  
正在洗衣服的真嗣立刻停下手中的活，跟着小女儿走到前门，因为他知道一旦爱希开了门并问候了门外的人，她就不知下一步该怎么办，除非门外的人是她熟悉的面孔，比如丽或加持。

Shinji had just gotten into the hallway in time to see that Aki opened the door. On the other side was a man who Shinji knew was a delivery postman, carrying a big box in both hands.  
真嗣刚好及时走到走廊，看到爱希打开了门。门外是一个真嗣认识的邮递员，双手抱着一个大箱子。

"Hi!" Aki greeted the delivery man, getting his attention as he was momentarily confused when he didn't see anyone at first within his height range.  
“嗨！”Aki 向快递员打招呼，当他一开始没看到任何人影而有些困惑时，成功吸引了他的注意。

Looking down to see the little girl, the man gave a small smile. "Why hello there, little one. Is your mommy or daddy home?" The guy said while gently placing the box he was holding down on the ground next to the door.  
男子低头看到小女孩，微微一笑。“你好呀，小家伙。你妈妈或爸爸在家吗？”他一边说着，一边轻轻地将手中的箱子放在门旁的地上。

Aki looked up at the guy before turning her head to shout out to her parents but stopped once her Papa came into view.  
Aki 抬头看了看男子，然后转头向父母喊话，但一看到爸爸出现就停了下来。

"Papa, the man was asking for you or Mama."  
“爸爸，那个人在找你或者妈妈。”

Shinji slightly grimace at this, especially now since the delivery guy was giving him a confused and weirded-out look at Aki calling him "Papa". Both him and Asuka knew that these kind of responses and looks were just the beginning and certainly not gonna go away anytime soon.  
听到这话，真嗣微微皱眉，尤其是现在送货员正用困惑和怪异的眼神看着 Aki 称呼他为“爸爸”。他和明日香都知道，这种反应和眼神只是开始，而且肯定不会很快消失。

Wanting to end this awkward moment as soon as possible, Shinji got right to the point while he slightly ruffled his daughters hair with one hand. "Hello, can I help you?"  
真嗣想尽快结束这个尴尬的时刻，于是他直截了当地问道，同时用一只手轻轻揉了揉女儿的头发。“你好，有什么需要帮忙的吗？”

"…Ah yes, if you can sign this for me please for the package." The delivery guy responded as he handed Shinji a clipboard and pen, wanted as well to move on from the awkward moment too.  
“…啊，是的，请您在这份包裹单上签个字。”快递员边说边递给真嗣一个夹板和笔，也想尽快摆脱这尴尬的气氛。

"Yeah sure." Shinji took the clipboard and pen and writing his signature on it, all the while Aki looked at the exchange as if trying to understand the situation while also giving the big cardboard box a few looks.  
“当然可以。”真嗣接过夹板和笔，签上了自己的名字，而秋则在一旁看着这一幕，似乎在努力理解情况，同时也时不时瞥向那个大纸箱。

Shinji finished signing the delivery and returned the clipboard and pen to the guy, to which the man said his thanks and turned to leave. Aki waved goodbye to the man till he was out of sight.  
真嗣签完快递单，将夹板和笔还给了快递员，那人道了谢便转身离开。秋一直挥手告别，直到他消失在视线之外。

Shinji looked at the box for a moment before picking it up, slightly struggling with it due to the weight and walking carefully back into the apartment with Aki following him.  
真嗣盯着箱子看了一会儿，然后费力地把它提起，小心翼翼地走回公寓，阿基跟在他后面。

"Papa why did you need to write for a box?" Aki asked curiously.  
“爸爸，你为什么要在箱子上写字呢？”阿基好奇地问。

"It's to let the delivery man's work place know that the box was delivered safely, honey," Shinji told his little girl truthfully.  
“这是为了让快递员的工作地点知道箱子已经安全送达了，亲爱的。”真嗣诚实地告诉他的小女儿。

"Oh ok…..Then what's inside the box, Papa? Is it takeout again?!" Aki looked at the box expectedly with a tiny bit of drool escaping her mouth. This earned a small chuckle from Shinji.  
“哦，好吧……那盒子里是什么，爸爸？又是外卖吗？！” 阿基期待地看着盒子，嘴角不自觉地流出一丝口水。这让真嗣轻笑了一声。

"No Aki, this isn't food again, though I have a pretty good idea what's in the box."  
“不，阿基，这次不是食物，不过我大概猜到盒子里是什么了。”

Making his way to the kitchen with Aki in tow, Shinji carefully placed the box down on the floor.  
真嗣带着阿基走向厨房，小心翼翼地将盒子放在地板上。

"Ok let's see if this is what I think it is." Shinji said before he tapped on top of the box a few times, in which the box slightly shook a few times. Shinji smiled as this left no doubt to what he thought was inside and ripped-off the tape on top, making it easier for the one inside the box to open up.  
“好，让我看看这是不是我想的那样。” 真嗣说着，轻轻敲了几下箱子顶部，箱子随之微微晃动了几下。真嗣笑了，这无疑证实了他的猜测，于是他撕掉了顶部的胶带，方便箱子里的那位打开。

"PenPen, it's ok you can come out now, you're home," Shinji called out to the box and not a second later the top burst open revealing the feathered black and white bird, which made Aki yip in surprise for a second. PenPen looked back and forth around the room to collect his bearings, possibly to make sure he was indeed home. At the same time Aki moved closer to the box, looking curiously at the small warm water penguin in wonder, which got PenPen's attention, making him turn and stare at the newcomer.  
“PenPen，没事了，你现在可以出来了，你到家了。” 真嗣对着箱子喊道，话音刚落，箱子顶部突然爆开，露出了那只黑白相间的羽毛鸟，这让阿基惊呼了一声。PenPen 环顾四周，似乎在确认自己确实回到了家。与此同时，阿基好奇地靠近箱子，惊讶地看着这只小巧温暖的水企鹅，这引起了 PenPen 的注意，它转过身来盯着这位新来者。

Both eyes of the little girl and small bird looked at each other in wonder for a moment, but the magic seemed to wear off quickly as PenPen seemingly got bored at looking at the little brown haired girl and jumped out of the box, tipping it over and making a few bits of foam peanuts go everywhere as a result.  
小女孩和小鸟的眼睛彼此好奇地对视了一会儿，但这种魔力似乎很快就消失了，因为 PenPen 似乎对看着这位棕色头发的小女孩感到厌倦，跳出了箱子，把它掀翻，导致一些泡沫花生四处飞散。

"Papa, it's a big bird!" Aki exclaimed in excitement, making Shinji chuckle.  
“爸爸，那是一只大鸟！”阿基兴奋地喊道，逗得真嗣笑了起来。

"Yeah, I know honey. His name is PenPen."  
“是啊，宝贝，我知道。它叫 PenPen。”

Aki tilted her head slightly in confusion. "Pen..Pee?….Is he a present for me?"  
阿基微微歪着头，有些困惑。“Pen...Pee？……他是给我的礼物吗？”

"No Aki, he's Auntie Misato's pet."

PenPen who was getting reacquainted with his surroundings stopped and turned to Shinji, given him a mean glare. "WARK!"  
正在重新熟悉周围环境的 PenPen 停下脚步，转向真嗣，给了他一个凶狠的眼神。“哇克！”

Shinji in turn gave the penguin an apologetic look for his mistake. "Sorry, sorry, I meant roommate." His apology calmed the penguin who once again went back to getting reacquainted to the apartment - well, for a few moments, before suddenly running towards the bathroom door which unfortunately for him was currently closed.  
真嗣则对企鹅投以歉意的目光，为自己的错误道歉。“对不起，对不起，我是说室友。”他的道歉让企鹅平静下来，再次开始熟悉公寓——好吧，只平静了一会儿，然后突然冲向浴室门，不幸的是，门当时是关着的。

"Waarrkk, waarrrkk!"

At this point Asuka finally came out of the bathroom from her shower, wrapped in her red towel and looked around in confusion. "Hey, what's all the commotion abo…hey!" Just as Asuka opened the door PenPen saw his chance and ran straight in past Asuka, closing the door behind him.  
此时，明日香终于洗完澡从浴室出来，裹着她的红色毛巾，困惑地环顾四周。“嘿，怎么这么吵……嘿！”就在明日香打开门的瞬间，PenPen 看到了机会，径直冲了进去，关上了门。

Asuka looked at her husband and daughter before giving a slight smile. "Guess Hikari delivered PenPen as instructed, huh?"  
明日香看着她的丈夫和女儿，微微一笑。“看来光是按照指示把 PenPen 送来了，对吧？”

Shinji nodded to her and picked up a small piece of paper that was in the box. "Yeah and it seems she left a note as well," Shinji said while opening the folded note and began to read it out loud.  
真嗣向她点点头，拿起盒子里的一张小纸条。“是的，而且她似乎还留了一张便条，”真嗣说着，展开折叠的便条，开始大声读出来。

"Dear Miss Katsuragi. As per your instructions I am delivering PenPen back to you once everything was ok back in Tokyo 3. At first I was going to arrange something to send him back to you, but it seems now as I'm writing this, that PenPen has already made his own arrangements and that he wants me to send him back by postal delivery?  
“亲爱的葛城小姐。根据您的指示，我在东京 3 号一切都恢复正常后，将 PenPen 送回给您。起初我打算安排一些方式将他送回，但似乎在我写这封信的时候，PenPen 已经自己做了安排，他希望我通过邮递将他送回？”

He seems quite adamant, but I'm a bit unsure about this. I'm sort of afraid that the little guy will starve to death or suffocate. So to make sure he makes it through the trip I did put some edible foods in the box with him and made sure that there are enough air holes in. So I do hope that he made it back safely.  
他似乎非常坚决，但我对此有些疑虑。我有点担心这个小家伙会饿死或窒息。所以为了确保他能安全度过旅途，我在箱子里放了一些可食用的食物，并确保有足够的通风孔。我真的希望他能安全返回。

P.S Can you please do something about PenPen's drinking?! While he wasn't a bother, he did end up finding and going through my fathers secret beer and wine bottle stash and it's bad enough that I had to scold my own father for his drinking in front of me and my sisters. So if possible please, please get him some help. I mean it's not natural for a penguin to drink alcohol so do get him help and possibly for yourself as well!"  
附言：你能处理一下 PenPen 的饮酒问题吗？虽然他没惹什么麻烦，但他确实找到了我父亲藏的啤酒和葡萄酒，这已经够糟糕了，我不得不在妹妹们面前训斥我父亲。所以如果可能的话，请帮帮他。我的意思是，企鹅喝酒不正常，请帮他寻求帮助，也许你自己也需要。

Both Shinji and Asuka both looked at each other a bit dumbfounded for a second before chuckling. It seemed Hikari let out a bit of her "Class Rep" wrath into the letter. Just as they finished the letter, the sound of the bathroom toilet flushing was heard, before the mentioned Penguin came out looking relived to have done his business. However, just as PenPen came out his path was blocked by the curious Aki.  
真嗣和明日香对视了一会儿，然后笑了起来。看来光在信中发泄了一些她作为班长的怒气。他们刚读完信，就听到了浴室马桶冲水的声音，随后提到的企鹅 PenPen 一脸轻松地走了出来。然而，PenPen 刚出来，就被好奇的 Aki 挡住了去路。

Once again the two locked eyes for a moment before PenPen broke the contact and passed the three year old child, clearly not interested in the young child as of yet. Aki continued to look at the bird with curiosity, even tilted her head in a confused manner.  
两人再次对视片刻，随后 PenPen 打破了沉默，径直走过那个三岁小孩，显然目前对这幼童并无兴趣。Aki 继续好奇地盯着那只鸟，甚至困惑地歪了歪头。

This behaviour of her daughter got Asuka's interest in what was on the girls mind. "What's the matter Aki?"  
女儿的这种行为引起了 Asuka 的注意，她想知道女孩心里在想什么。"怎么了，Aki？"

Aki looked at her Mama while pointing at PenPen, who just sat down on couch and rudely changed the channel on the TV to an animal documentary. "How come Pen…Pee isn't flying Mama?"  
Aki 看着妈妈，手指向刚刚在沙发上坐下、粗鲁地切换电视频道到动物纪录片的 PenPen，问道："为什么 Pen…Pen 不飞呢，妈妈？"

Asuka laughed a little at Aki's mistake with saying PenPen's name, but just gave her daughter the simplest answer. "Well, Schätzchen, because he can't fly."  
看到 Aki 把 PenPen 的名字说错了，Asuka 轻声笑了笑，但还是给了女儿最简单的答案。“嗯，宝贝，因为他不会飞。”

"He can't fly?" Aki parroted, eyes widened at this revelation.  
“他不会飞？”Aki 鹦鹉学舌般重复道，听到这个事实眼睛瞪得大大的。

"That's right. Anyway I'll be back in a minute ok." Asuka said before walking towards the bedroom to get changed.  
“没错。总之我一会儿就回来，好吗？”Asuka 说完便走向卧室去换衣服。

Aki meanwhile turned towards the unaware penguin watching the TV with a thoughtful expression before an idea suddenly came to her. PenPen with with his animal instincts felt a cold shiver down your spine for a moment at the same moment Aki had come up with her idea.  
与此同时，Aki 转向那只毫无察觉的企鹅，它正若有所思地看着电视，突然一个念头闪过她的脑海。PenPen 凭借动物的本能，在这一刻感到脊背一阵发凉。

x-x-x-x-x-x

WAAARRKKK, WAAARRRKK!

"Hey, what's with all the noise this time!?" Asuka asked no one in particular as she came out of her and Shinji's bedroom. Shinji who was busy cooking was also wondering on what the noise was about and stopped to investigate.  
“嘿，这次怎么这么吵！？”明日香从她和真嗣的卧室里走出来，向四周问道。正在忙着做饭的真嗣也很好奇这噪音的来源，停下来准备一探究竟。

"It sounded like PenPen but what got him so…OH MY GOD!" Shinji said while screaming out the last part in shock.  
“听起来像是 PenPen，但他怎么了……哦，我的天哪！”真嗣惊叫道，最后一部分几乎是尖叫出来的。

Asuka followed her partner's line of sight and saw to her horror on the apartment's outside balcony was her daughter on top of the delivery box, holding a struggling and screaming PenPen.  
明日香顺着搭档的视线望去，惊恐地发现女儿正站在公寓外的阳台上，站在快递箱上，手里抓着一只挣扎尖叫的 PenPen。

"Fly birdy!" Aki said while unaware of what she was really about to do. And just as Aki loosened her grip on the bird, Shinji had thankfully managed to run up to them in time and caught the penguin and quickly moved him away from the edge.  
“飞吧，小鸟！”爱希说着，却没意识到自己即将要做的事。就在爱希松开鸟的那一刻，幸好真嗣及时跑到她们身边，接住了企鹅，并迅速将其从边缘移开。

"AKI!" Asuka shouted. The little girl jumped at the pitched voice of her mother and between that and the angry look she gave her, Aki knew she did something bad. Asuka grabbed her daughters shoulders and looked straight into her eyes. "Aki what were you doing!?"  
“爱希！”明日香大喊。小女孩被母亲尖锐的声音吓了一跳，再加上那愤怒的表情，爱希知道自己做错了事。明日香抓住女儿的肩膀，直视着她的眼睛。“爱希，你在干什么！？”

Aki was confused at why she was being scolded. "Well you said that PeePee can't fly Mama, so I was helping him. Since we are so high up then he would surely be able to fly from up here," Aki said. By her explanation for her actions and it dawned on Asuka and Shinji, the later who was still holding the scared and shaking penguin in his arms, what the problem was.  
Aki 不明白为什么会被责骂。“可是妈妈，你说 PenPen 不会飞，所以我才想帮他。既然我们这么高，他从这里肯定能飞起来，”Aki 解释道。她的这番话让 Asuka 和 Shinji 恍然大悟，后者还抱着那只惊恐颤抖的企鹅，明白了问题所在。

Asuka sighed before once again looking at her daughter. "Aki, when I said that PenPen can't fly, it didn't mean that he doesn't know how. It's because he really can't actually fly."  
Asuka 叹了口气，再次看向女儿。“Aki，当我说 PenPen 不会飞时，并不是说他不知道怎么飞。而是因为他真的不能飞。”

Being told this, Aki had a confused look. "But he's a bird Mama, and all birds fly, don't they?"  
听到这话，Aki 一脸困惑。“但他是一只鸟啊，妈妈，所有的鸟都会飞的，不是吗？”

"Well, no honey, not all birds actually fly," Shinji added in to the conversation. "You see, PenPen here is a special type of bird that swims in water rather than fly."  
"嗯，不，亲爱的，并不是所有的鸟都会飞，" 真嗣加入对话中。"你看，PenPen 是一种特殊的鸟，它在水里游泳而不是飞翔。"

Aki's eye lit up the mention of swimming. "So Pen..Pen really swims like a fishy?"  
提到游泳，Aki 的眼睛亮了起来。"所以 Pen...Pen 真的像鱼一样游泳吗？"

Shinji nodded to her. "That's right. Now honey you need to say sorry to poor PenPen here as you could have seriously hurt him," Shinji said a bit sternly while crouching down and holding the penguin in front of him towards Aki.  
真嗣向她点头。"没错。现在，亲爱的，你需要向可怜的 PenPen 道歉，因为你可能真的伤害到他了，" 真嗣语气略显严肃地说着，蹲下身来，把企鹅抱在身前，面向 Aki。

Aki gave the frightened and still shaken penguin an apologetic look. "I'm sorry PenPen."  
阿基给了那只受惊且仍在颤抖的企鹅一个歉意的眼神。“对不起，PenPen。”

PenPen's only reaction to this was to finally stop shaking before given Aki his best glare before given her his best intimidating cry.  
PenPen 对此的唯一反应是终于停止了颤抖，然后给了阿基一个最严厉的瞪视，接着向她发出最具威慑力的叫声。

"WAARRRKKK!"

No sooner had he finished, PenPen broke free of Shinji's hold and ran straight into his freezer and locked it behind him, with the eyes of the two parents and child all bewildered at what just happened. At the same moment everyone heard the apartment door open.  
他刚一结束，PenPen 就挣脱了真嗣的怀抱，径直跑进冰箱并把自己锁在里面，留下两位家长和孩子的眼睛都茫然地注视着刚刚发生的一切。与此同时，每个人都听到了公寓门的开启声。

"Hey everyone, I'm home!" The cheery voice of Misato was heard and Asuka and Shinji would now have to explain to their guardian on the rough start between Aki and PenPen.  
“大家好，我回来了！”美里欢快的声音响起，而明日香和真嗣现在不得不向他们的监护人解释阿基和 PenPen 之间糟糕的开始。

### Chapter 3 The Door Sign  
Chapter 3 门牌

"And this is a new picture I made of when I first met PenPen. See that's me holding him!"  
“这是我第一次见到 PenPen 时画的新图。看，那是我抱着他！”

"…I see."

Asuka couldn't help but smile at the sight of her daughter and Rei Ayanami interacting with each other in the living room of the Katsuragi apartment while she was watching from the kitchen with Shinji currently cooking dinner, with a vegetarian meal for their honoured guest.  
明日香忍不住在看到女儿和绫波零在葛城公寓的客厅里互动时露出了微笑，而她则从厨房里观察着这一幕，此时真嗣正在为他们的贵客准备一顿素食晚餐。

She still couldn't believe that Rei had not only found her baby girl but also brought her back to her and Shinji safely without so much as a scratch considering the dangers that was going on around them at the time of their little adventure. Once again she and Shinji were sure that it was a miracle in itself and that she and her husband would be forever grateful to her for that.  
她仍然无法相信绫波不仅找到了她的女儿，还将她安全地带回了她和真嗣身边，毫发无损，考虑到当时他们周围发生的种种危险。她和真嗣再次确信这本身就是个奇迹，她和丈夫将永远感激她。

It was a surprise when earlier in the day, Rei had come very early in the morning to see them just as the small family was about to go to a nearby playground for Aki to play in. It seemed that Rei was keeping her promise to see Aki now and then and the little brown haired girl was both glad and excited to see her first ever friend again.  
今天早些时候，绫波一大早就来拜访他们，当时这个小家庭正准备去附近的游乐场让阿基玩耍，这让人感到意外。看来绫波正在履行她时不时来看望阿基的承诺，这位棕色头发的小女孩既高兴又兴奋地再次见到了她第一个朋友。

It was also a rare sight for both her and Shinji, seeing Rei of all people playing with Aki around the kids playground. From swinging on the swing set, climbing on the jungle-gym, the seesaw to lastly playing in the sand box which Rei had managed to create a perfect sand pyramid much to the amazement of everyone present, especially Aki who absolutely loved it.  
对于她和真嗣来说，看到丽在儿童游乐场和阿基玩耍，这景象也颇为罕见。从荡秋千、攀爬游乐架，到玩跷跷板，最后在沙池里，丽竟然堆出了一个完美的沙金字塔，让在场所有人都惊叹不已，尤其是阿基，她对此喜爱至极。

Asuka also remembered Shinji pointing out to her of how much Rei was smiling more around Aki. It further cemented to her that Aki's childlike innocence was capable of melting the coldest of hearts. Perhaps it could have worked on Gendo Ikari himself had he and Aki met. Not that Asuka would ever let the man near her precious baby girl, even if he ever did somehow managed to recover and come out of his coma.  
明日香还记得真嗣曾向她指出，丽在阿基身边笑得更多了。这进一步让她确信，阿基的天真无邪足以融化最冰冷的心。或许如果她和碇源堂相遇，也能产生同样的效果。不过明日香绝不会让那个男人靠近她心爱的宝贝女儿，哪怕他真的奇迹般地从昏迷中苏醒过来。

After the playground everyone made a small trip to the supermarket as Shinji wanted to gets some ingredients for dinner tonight, especially some vegetarian ones since Rei was also staying for dinner. Aki also took the time to ask many questions regarding stuff round her in the shop, from what was money is and what it was for to what was in various food and drinks.  
离开游乐场后，大家顺路去了超市，因为真嗣想买些今晚晚餐的食材，特别是一些素食，因为丽也会留下来吃晚饭。阿基也趁机问了许多关于店里物品的问题，从钱是什么、有什么用到各种食物和饮料里都有些什么。

Thankfully for Asuka and Shinji, many of Aki's harder questions were answered by Rei during that time. They only needed to step in during a very brief tantrum Aki made in wanting a big bag of cookies to eat now, to which a compromise was made that she could have it but only eat them after dinner. Eventually, they ended up back at the apartment and Aki wasted no time in wanting to draw what was on her little mind while grabbing Rei to join her and occasionally show her previous works to the blue haired teen.  
幸好，在那时，许多阿基的难题都被绫波解答了。对于阿基想要一大袋饼干立即吃的短暂脾气，他们只需介入，达成妥协，允许她拥有但只能在晚饭后吃。最终，他们回到了公寓，阿基迫不及待地想画出她脑海中的小想法，并拉着绫波一起，偶尔还向蓝发少女展示她的过往作品。

Rei once again surprised both parents on her artistic talent. She had drawn a very photographic image of a smiling and happy Aki that was on the seesaw. Asuka concluded that Rei must have some sort of photographic memory to be able to remember every detail. Before Asuka could finish that train of thought she heard the front door opening.  
绫波再次以其艺术天赋让两位家长感到惊讶。她画了一幅非常逼真的画面，画中是坐在跷跷板上微笑快乐的阿基。明日香推测绫波一定有某种照相记忆能力，能记住每一个细节。在明日香还没结束这个念头时，她听到了前门打开的声音。

"Hey everyone, I'm home!" The familiar cheery voice of Misato was heard, before she walked in into the kitchen. She had a bunch of documents under her arm and held a plastic bag with her other hand.  
“大家好，我回来了！”美里那熟悉而欢快的声音传来，随后她走进了厨房。她腋下夹着一叠文件，另一只手提着一个塑料袋。

"Welcome home auntie Misato!" Aki said having already gotten up from the living room to greet the older woman home from work.  
“欢迎回家，美里阿姨！”阿基已经从客厅起身，迎接刚下班回家的年长女性。

Putting the work documents she had on the table, as well as the bag, she smiled at the energetic four year old despite her tiredness. "Hey little troublemaker, what have you been up to today?" Misato asked as she went to the fridge to get a can of juice.  
她把工作文件和包放在桌上，尽管疲惫，还是对这位充满活力的四岁小孩微笑。“嘿，小捣蛋鬼，今天都做了些什么？”美里问道，同时走向冰箱拿一罐果汁。

Aki, given the go ahead, told Misato the days events as any four year old could. "Today Mama and Papa took me to the big playground in the city and it had all the cool things in it that no other playground had but before we got of the apartment Rei came by to see me! She ended up coming with us and we played on everything there and me and Rei played in the sandbox last and Rei made this cool piromid thingy."  
得到允许后，阿基像任何一个四岁孩子那样，向美里讲述了当天的经历。“今天妈妈和爸爸带我去了城里的大游乐场，那里有其他游乐场没有的酷炫设施，但在我们离开公寓之前，丽来找我了！她最后也跟我们一起去，我们在那里玩遍了所有东西，最后我和丽在沙池里玩，丽还做了一个很酷的沙金字塔。”

"A what now?" Misato looked at the child with a tiny bit of confusion at the last unfamiliar word.  
"什么现在？" 美里看着孩子，对那个不熟悉的词略感困惑。

"The correct saying is pyramid." A soft voice said, one familiar to the Major and Misato looked up to see Rei getting up from her position from the living room to greet the older woman.  
"正确的说法是金字塔。" 一个柔和的声音说道，这是美里熟悉的声音，她抬头看到绫波从客厅的位置起身迎接这位年长的女性。

"Oh hi Rei, nice to see you," Misato said, surprised slightly at the blue haired girl here.  
"哦，嗨绫波，很高兴见到你，" 美里说道，对蓝发女孩出现在这里感到有些惊讶。

Rei politely bowed at her. "Pardon for the intrusion Major Katsuragi."  
丽礼貌地向她鞠了一躬。“打扰了，葛城美里少校。”

Misato sighed at the official title Rei used for her. "Rei it's ok you don't have to call me Major anymore. I mean the war is over now so just call me Misato."  
美里对丽使用的正式称呼叹了口气。“丽，没关系的，你不必再叫我少校了。我是说，战争已经结束了，所以就叫我美里吧。”

Rei seemed to hesitate or at least that was what Misato thought she could see on the blue haired teen's face. It was hard to tell given the girl lack of facial expressions.  
丽似乎有些犹豫，至少美里觉得她从蓝发少女的脸上看出了这一点。不过考虑到女孩缺乏表情的脸，这很难判断。

"Very well…Miss Katsuragi," was the only answer that came out of Rei mouth and Misato deeply sighed at this, but concluded that this was probably going to be the most informal greeting she was gonna get out of Rei for now.  
“很好……葛城小姐，”这是从丽口中唯一能得到的回答，美里对此深深叹了口气，但她认为这大概是目前能从丽那里得到的最为随意的问候了。

"Hey, I didn't finish my story!" Aki grumpily complained.  
“嘿，我还没讲完我的故事呢！”阿基不满地抱怨道。

Misato looked back down at the little girl. "Oh sorry kiddo, go on then." Giving Aki chance to finish her tale of today's events.  
美里再次低头看向小女孩。“哦，对不起，孩子，继续吧。”给了阿基机会来完成她今天经历的故事。

"So um…oh yeah after the playground me, Mama, Papa and Rei went to get stuff for dinner at the huge food place that had everything. I wanted to go in the big fridge thingy as it was soo cool in there but Mama and Papa said I wasn't allowed to. Oh and when we got everything I wanted to eat the bag of cookies but Mama and Papa said that I would have to wait till after we had dinner until I can have them.  
"所以嗯…哦对了，在游乐场之后，我和妈妈、爸爸还有丽一起去那个什么都有的大食品店买晚餐的东西。我想进那个大冰箱里，因为那里超级凉快，但妈妈和爸爸说不行。哦，还有当我们买完所有东西后，我想吃那袋饼干，但妈妈和爸爸说必须等到吃完晚饭后才能吃。"

"Oh a bag of cookies. Are they the multicoloured ones?" Misato asked expectedly.  
"哦，一袋饼干。是那种五彩缤纷的吗？" 美里期待地问道。"

"Hey no sweet or snacks right now," Shinji firmly said. "I'm just dishing up dinner anyway."  
"嘿，现在不能吃甜食或零食，" 真嗣坚定地说。"我正要盛晚饭呢。"

"Aaaawwww!" Both Aki and Misato said at the same time, disappointed.  
"哎呀呀！" 阿基和美里同时失望地说道。

"Misato can you move your work stuff off the table please?" Shinji asked.  
"美里，你能把工作的东西从桌子上移开吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Ok got it, and oh it's not all work stuff." Misato said while picking up her work papers. "I actually bought something else while I was coming home."  
"好的，明白了，而且哦，并不是所有都是工作的东西。" 美里一边拿起她的工作文件一边说，"实际上，我在回家的路上还买了别的东西。"

"Let me guess, you've finally gotten back on the beer wagon." Asuka snickered before given the purpled haired woman a stern glare. "But seriously Misato, no drinking alcohol around Aki!"  
"让我猜猜，你终于又回到啤酒的怀抱了。" 明日香嗤笑一声，随即对紫发女子投以严厉的目光。"但说真的美里，别在绫身边喝酒！"

"No, it isn't alcohol Asuka, it's actually..."  
"不，明日香，这不是酒，其实是……"

"What is alcohol?" Aki asked innocently while she was helped seating at the table by Shinji.  
"酒是什么？" 绫天真地问道，同时被真嗣扶着坐在桌旁。

"It's nothi-" Asuka quickly tried to dismiss the question but another voiced answered the little girls question anyway.  
"没什么-" 明日香迅速试图驳回这个问题，但另一个声音还是回答了小女孩的疑问。

"Alcohol is an ingredient found in beer, wine..." Rei began to say.  
"酒精是啤酒、葡萄酒中的一种成分……" 丽开始解释道。

""Rei, please, she doesn't need to know that yet!"" Both Asuka and Shinji said in unison.  
""丽，拜托，她还不需要知道这些！"" 明日香和真嗣异口同声地说。

"Oh…my apologies," Rei apologised for her little error.  
"哦…我的歉意，" 丽为她的这个小错误道歉。

"Anyway as I was saying, what I bought were new door signs!" Misato said to to the group, pulling out a familiar heart shaped sign. "When I saw that you gave Aki yours, Shinji, I decided to get one for myself."  
"总之，正如我所说，我买的是新的门牌！" 美里对大家说，拿出一个熟悉的心形标志。"当我看到你把你的给了明，真嗣，我决定自己也买一个。"

Misato gave both her two charges a smirk. "And I got you guys one too." Pulling another identical heart shaped sign from the plastic bag. "Maybe you can write on it 'The lovers suite'." Misato added in, her smirk widening at the blushes appearing on the two while Aki giggled at seeing her parents becoming embarrassed.  
美里向她的两个被监护人投去一个得意的微笑。"我也给你们俩准备了一个。"她从塑料袋里又拿出一个相同的心形标志。"也许你们可以在上面写上'恋人套房'。"美里补充道，看到两人脸红，明则在一旁咯咯笑着，看着她的父母变得尴尬。

"Oh, stop it, Misato," Asuka said the purpled haired woman just as Shinji set the dinner plates on the table with Aki and Rei being served their dinner first.  
“哦，别这样，美里，”明日香对那位紫发女子说道，就在这时，真嗣将晚餐盘子摆上桌，先是给绫和丽盛上了晚餐。

Eventually the evening became quiet after dinner with Rei set on returning back to her apartment despite Aki wanting her friend to stay the night, with Shinji, Asuka and Misato's giving the blue haired girl permission that she could.  
晚餐后，夜晚渐渐归于宁静，尽管绫希望好友留宿，丽还是决定返回自己的公寓，真嗣、明日香和美里都同意她可以这么做。

Much to Aki's dismay Rei politely declined the invitation, but promised Aki that she would indeed come around again soon and Asuka brought up the plan to go out into the city to get new clothes for not only Aki but for Rei herself, despite the later saying that current clothes were sufficient.  
令绫失望的是，丽礼貌地拒绝了邀请，但承诺不久后会再来，明日香提议大家一起去城里买新衣服，不仅为绫，也为丽，尽管后者表示现有的衣服已经足够。

After their guest left, it became the traditional night to prepare Aki for bedtime. However, Aki having a fun and exciting day was very tired and didn't put up much of a resistance tonight, so bath time and brushing her teeth was easy. Just as the two parents were guiding Aki to her room (formerly Shinji's) Asuka noticed the familiar heart shaped sign on her and Shinji's room but what stopped her in her dead in her tracks was what was already written on it.  
客人离开后，这晚成了传统的为 Aki 准备睡觉的时间。然而，Aki 度过了一个愉快而激动的一天，非常疲惫，今晚并没有太多抗拒，因此洗澡和刷牙都变得轻松。正当两位父母引导 Aki 走向她的房间（原先是 Shinji 的）时，Asuka 注意到了她和 Shinji 房间上熟悉的爱心标志，但让她愣在原地的是上面已经写好的字。

On it in clear bold black Kanji was "**Shinji & Asuka's Lovers Suite**".  
上面用清晰的黑体汉字写着：“Shinji 与 Asuka 的爱侣套房”。

"Wh..What the hell!?" Asuka said out loud, somewhat startling her husband and daughter just as the first opened the bedroom door.  
“什……什么鬼？！”Asuka 大声说道，有些惊动了她的丈夫和女儿，就在 Shinji 刚打开卧室门的那一刻。

"What's wrong?" Shinji enquired.  
“怎么了？”真嗣询问道。

"Don't you see, look baka!" Asuka said while pointing at the sign on their bedroom door. Shinji, now clearly seeing it too, stood there for a second before letting out a heavy sigh, immediately knowing the culprit to this crime.  
“你没看见吗，笨蛋！”明日香指着他们卧室门上的标志说道。真嗣现在也清楚地看到了，站在那里愣了一会儿，然后重重地叹了口气，立刻知道了这个恶作剧的罪魁祸首。

"Jeez Misato, how immature are you?" Asuka said out loud before grabbing the heart shaped sign on the door with one hand, intending to remove it but unfortunately it didn't budge off the door. Asuka confused for a second now grabbed it with both hands and using a bit for force but still no result. Now getting angry and impatient, Asuka kept trying to pull the thing off with even more force than before but still nothing was happening.  
“天啊，美里，你多大了还这么幼稚？”明日香大声说道，然后一只手抓住门上心形的标志，打算把它取下来，但不幸的是它纹丝不动。明日香愣了一下，现在用两只手抓住它，稍微用了点力，但还是没有结果。现在变得又气又急，明日香继续用力拉扯，比之前更加用力，但仍然没有任何动静。

"Errr God..Goddamn it Misato! What the hell did you do! Superglue this thing to the door!?"  
"哎呀天哪...该死的 Misato！你到底干了什么！把这玩意儿用超级胶水粘在门上了吗？！"

Shinji and Aki couldn't help but stand back, watching as Asuka fought against the immovable door sign. Asuka, letting go for a second, quickly turned to Shinji.  
真嗣和 Aki 忍不住后退几步，看着 Asuka 与那纹丝不动的门牌搏斗。Asuka 暂时松手，迅速转向真嗣。

"Shinji, help with me this!"  
"真嗣，帮我一下！"

"But…but Asuka, it's just one of Misato's pranks and it's not that big a deal is it?" Shinji tried to reason with his red haired wife. Unfortunately his response was not the right thing to say, judging by the mean glare she shot at him.  
"但…但明日香，这只是美里的一次恶作剧，并不是什么大不了的事，对吧？" 真嗣试图和他的红发妻子讲道理。不幸的是，他的回答似乎并不恰当，从她投来的凶狠目光可以判断。

"What are you, stupid!? We may live here but what if we're going to be having company in the future and if someone were to see this they will jump to the wrong conclusion!" Asuka resorted back at her husband.  
"你是不是傻啊！？我们虽然住在这里，但万一将来有客人来访，要是有人看到这个，他们会得出错误的结论的！" 明日香回敬她的丈夫。

"But we're going tell people eventually anyway," Shinji said back.  
"但无论如何，我们迟早都会告诉人们的，" 真嗣回应道。

"Yes Baka, but on our own terms, otherwise we'll be trying to sort out everyone's confusing conclusions and questions. So stop standing there and help me get this thing off already."  
“是啊，笨蛋，但得按我们的方式来，不然我们只会被大家混乱的结论和问题搞得晕头转向。所以别站在那儿了，快来帮我把它弄下来。”

Shinji sighed once again. "Yes dear," he said before assisting her. With both parents now struggling with the door sign, a now wide awake Aki just watched and laughed at their attempts.  
真嗣再次叹了口气。“好的，亲爱的。”他说着上前帮忙。两位家长现在正一起努力对付门牌，而已经完全醒来的 Aki 只是看着他们的尝试，笑个不停。

Across the apartment in her room Misato who was working on her laptop, could overhear the struggles going on and couldn't help but grin and giggle to herself. Her prank had been successful.  
在公寓另一头的房间里，正在笔记本电脑前工作的美里，能听到外面的动静，忍不住自己偷笑起来。她的恶作剧成功了。

### Chapter 4 Shopping Trip  
Chapter 购物之旅

"I still do not see the need for me to be part of this activity. The clothes I have are..." Rei tried to finish but was promptly cut off.  
"我还是不明白为什么我必须参加这个活动。我现有的衣服……" 丽试图说完，但很快被打断了。

"Mein Gott Rei, we've been over this already." Asuka sighed as she, Shinji, Rei and Aki walked along the road that lead to one of the many train stations of Tokyo 3. Shinji and Aki were further ahead of the girls due to the three year old's excitement at her new surroundings and Shinji being the cautious father kept her very near him and in sight while making sure she was away from any potential dangers. "It's not about being sufficient it's about both looking and feeling good about yourself."  
"我的天啊，丽，我们已经讨论过这个了。" 明日香叹了口气，她和真嗣、丽以及阿基沿着通往东京 3 众多火车站之一的道路走着。真嗣和阿基走在前面，因为三岁的阿基对新环境感到兴奋，而真嗣作为谨慎的父亲，确保她紧靠自己并处于视线范围内，同时远离任何潜在危险。"这不是关于是否足够，而是关于让自己看起来和感觉良好。"

"But the main reason for this activity is to find more clothing for Aki to wear," Rei stated.  
"但这次活动的主要目的是为 Aki 找更多衣服穿，" 丽解释道。

"Yes, that's the main reason for this trip and it's not just clothes we need to get her, there's finding her a new tooth brush, get her some toys that she can play with now, a nightgown or two and especially better shoes than the cheap ones we managed to find before," Asuka explained.  
"是的，这次旅行的主要目的就是这个，我们不仅要给她买衣服，还得找新的牙刷，买些她现在能玩的玩具，一两件睡衣，特别是要给她买比之前找到的那些便宜货更好的鞋子，" 明日香详细说明。

"I don't want any more shoes!" Aki shouted from her distance ahead, having somewhat heard her Mama say that dreaded word, especially since she was forced by her parents to wear the ones she had on currently despite her protests.  
"我不要再买鞋子了！" Aki 从前面稍远的地方喊道，她隐约听到妈妈提到那个让她害怕的词，尤其是她现在被迫穿着父母让她穿的这双鞋，尽管她抗议过。

"You're getting new and better shoes, Fräulein and that's final!" Asuka shouted firmly back to her daughter.  
"你要换新鞋了，小姐，这是最终决定！" 明日香坚定地向女儿喊道。

"Awww."

Asuka turned her focus on Rei again. "Also it's not just stuff to get her, you definitely need a new wardrobe. Trust me Rei, by the time I'm finished with helping you look for clothes, you won't even recognise yourself in the mirror," Asuka proclaimed with confidence.  
明日香再次将注意力转向丽。"而且不只是给她买东西，你绝对需要一套新衣橱。相信我，丽，等我帮你挑完衣服，你在镜子里都认不出自己了，" 明日香自信地宣称。

"I very much doubt that, my facial features are quite distinguishable," Rei said.  
"我对此深表怀疑，我的面部特征相当明显，" 丽说道。

Asuka sighed heavily at that response. Figures that Rei would take that quite literal.  
明日香对这个回答重重地叹了口气。果然，绫波会这么字面理解。

A small part of her was wondering why she was doing this for Rei Ayanami. An old and ugly part of her somewhat still resented Rei, but Asuka shook her head at that dark thought. Rei had not only prevented the end of the world but most importantly she had found, saved and brought her baby back to her and Shinji, for which she was eternally grateful to her.  
她心中有一小部分在想，为什么要为绫波·绫波这么做。一个陈旧且丑陋的部分仍然对她有些怨恨，但明日香摇了摇头，驱散了那个阴暗的想法。绫波不仅阻止了世界的终结，更重要的是，她找到了、救回了并将她的孩子带回了她和真嗣身边，为此她永远感激她。

The walk to the station was uneventful with the exception of Aki getting overexcited over everything, from the billboard and poster advertisements, moving escalators and lifts, the local stores and lastly the trains themselves which originally Aki thought were huge cars. This made Asuka and Shinji chuckle while Rei told Aki the correct name for the moving trains before they got on to one. After a few stops the group made it to their destination, the Tokyo 3 mall. Upon entering the main entrance, the trio plus the little girl noticed the lack of people.  
走到车站的路上一切都很平静，除了阿基对一切都过度兴奋，从广告牌和海报广告、自动扶梯和电梯、当地商店，到最后火车本身，阿基最初以为它们是巨大的汽车。这让明日香和真嗣笑了起来，而绫波则在她们上车前告诉阿基这些移动火车的正确名称。经过几个站点后，一行人到达了目的地——第三东京市购物中心。进入主入口时，三人加上小女孩注意到人烟稀少。

"There doesn't seem to be anybody here," Shinji said while looking around. Eventually he turned to look at Asuka. "Are you sure that the mall is open today Asuka?"  
"这里似乎没有人，" 真嗣环顾四周后说道。最终他转向看着明日香。"你确定今天商场开门吗，明日香？"

Asuka looked at her partner with a small glare. "Of course it's open today baka. I checked the news outlets and they specifically said the stores are reopening today. Look, many of the stores are open," Asuka said while pointing at the obviously open shops, many of which showed the employees inside through the clear open glass.  
明日香略带不满地看了她的搭档一眼。"当然今天开门，笨蛋。我查过新闻了，他们明确说今天商店重新开业。看，很多商店都开着，" 明日香指着明显开着的店铺说道，许多店铺通过透明的玻璃窗可以看到里面的员工。

"She is correct that the stores are indeed open. It's just that the inhabitants of the city have not returned to the city which is the reason why the mall is so devoid of people," Rei added in giving the logical reason why the mall was so empty.  
"她说的没错，商店确实都开了。只是城市的居民还没有回来，这就是为什么商场这么空旷的原因，" 绫波补充道，给出了商场为何如此空旷的合理解释。

"Well, that just means that we can do this a lot more smoothly than expected, plus it also means that we can grab the best stuff here first," Asuka proclaimed while turning and looking back at the family and Rei, especially giving Aki a grin. "So let's get to it then."  
"好吧，这意味着我们可以比预期更顺利地完成这件事，而且这也意味着我们可以先抢到这里的最好的东西，" 明日香一边转身看着家人和绫波，特别是对绫波露出了一个笑容。"那么，我们就开始吧。"

Aki was also just as excited. "Yeah, let's do this!" Aki yelled clinching her small fist before raising it. She would have run further into the mall without Rei or her parents if not for Shinji securely holding her other hand. At best Aki only managed to slightly tug her father forward, which got a chuckle out her parents and a small smile from Rei.  
绫波也同样兴奋。"耶，我们开始吧！" 绫波紧握着小拳头喊道，然后举起手。如果不是真嗣紧紧握住她的另一只手，她早就跑进商场深处，不顾绫波或她的父母了。最多绫波只能稍微拉扯一下她的父亲，这让她的父母笑出声，绫波也露出了微笑。

The group decided to get Aki's essentials first before looking for clothes. Next item was also easy as despite her dislike of brushing her teeth every morning and night, Aki took a liking to a particular bright red coloured kiddie toothbrush.  
这群人决定先给绫波买必需品，然后再找衣服。下一个物品也很容易，尽管绫波不喜欢每天早晚刷牙，但她对一个特别亮红色的儿童牙刷情有独钟。

The next stop was to get a few new toys for Aki to play with now, which turned out to be a challenge, since with her birthday coming up soon, Asuka and Shinji couldn't let her have everything she saw and thus had to restrict their desire to spoil her. They also had to limit the budget spending and had to consider the carrying capacity.  
下一站是给 Aki 买些新玩具，这竟然成了个挑战，因为她的生日即将来临，Asuka 和 Shinji 不能让她看到什么就买什么，不得不克制自己宠她的冲动。他们还得控制预算开支，并考虑携带能力。

Fortunately for them, Aki surprisingly somewhat understood after being told firmly by her parents and after they promised to buy her very top favourites for her upcoming special day to appease the little girl. After picking out a bunch of toys which Aki wanted and could have now to play with, a question came up from the little one's mind when they arrived at the cashier.  
幸运的是，Aki 在父母坚定地解释后，竟然意外地理解了，而且当他们承诺在她即将到来的特别日子里买她最喜欢的玩具来安抚她时，小女孩也平静了下来。在挑选了一堆 Aki 现在想要并能玩的玩具后，当他们到达收银台时，小家伙的脑海中冒出了一个问题。

"Hey Mama, why does Papa need to give little pieces of paper to other people?" Aki asked while pointing to the Japanese Yen notes Shinji was giving the store cashier after the items where scanned. This comment also earned a bewildered and confused look from the guy when Aki said Mama and Papa, something both parents tried to ignore.  
“嘿，妈妈，为什么爸爸需要给别人小纸片呢？”Aki 指着 Shinji 在商品扫描后递给收银员的日元纸币问道。当 Aki 称呼他们为“妈妈”和“爸爸”时，这个称呼也让 Shinji 露出了困惑的表情，但两位家长都尽量不去在意。

"Um, well, Schätzchen, the reason is…the reason is..." This question from Aki turned out to be a difficult one to explain especially to a three, soon to be four year old. Normally Asuka would try to push the more tough and difficult questions Aki wanted answers to on to Shinji (mostly getting a bit of fun watching him squirm) but since he was distracted with paying and placing the toys into the plastic bags Asuka turned to their companion Rei, deciding to let her answer this. "Oh Rei knows the answer to this, don't you Rei?".  
"呃，那个，宝贝，原因嘛…原因就是…"" 这个问题来自 Aki，对一个即将四岁的孩子解释起来确实棘手。通常情况下，Asuka 会把 Aki 那些难以回答的问题推给 Shinji（主要是想看他局促不安的样子取乐），但这次 Shinji 正忙着付款和把玩具装进塑料袋，于是 Asuka 转向他们的同伴 Rei，决定让她来回答。"哦，Rei 知道答案的，对吧，Rei？"

Rei nodded at Asuka before fully turning her attention to Aki. "The pieces of paper you see are notes of the Japanese currency called Yen. The reason why we give them to other people is because we live in a capitalised and economic society where in order to obtain goods or services one must give payment to those that service us in exchange."  
Rei 向 Asuka 点头示意后，将注意力完全转向 Aki。"你看到的那些纸片是日本货币，称为日元。我们之所以要把它们给别人，是因为我们生活在一个资本主义经济体系中，为了获得商品或服务，必须向为我们提供服务的人支付报酬。"

Aki looked up and stared blankly at Rei for a bit, clearly confused on many parts on what the blue haired teen had just told her. "Oh..um…okay?" she said while scratching your head.  
Aki 抬头看着 Rei，眼神中透露出明显的困惑，显然对蓝发少女刚才的话有许多不解之处。"哦…呃…好吧？"她一边说着，一边挠了挠头。

With the group finally gotten most of necessities for Aki, they finally could get to the main part and the biggest clothing store in the mall. One that catered to men, women and children.  
随着团队终于为 Aki 备齐了大部分必需品，他们终于可以进入购物中心的主要部分，也是最大的服装店。这家店为男女老少提供服务。

Upon arriving at the entrance, Shinji, Asuka and Rei noticed that like the rest of the mall the shop was practically empty of customers. It also seemed that there weren't many of employees present either as they saw only one female retailer plus the cashier present. The female retailer looked bored out of her mind and was on her phone either checking her texts messages or playing some game on her phone, all while not having noticing the group that had entered the store.  
到达入口时，Shinji、Asuka 和 Rei 注意到，与购物中心的其他部分一样，这家店几乎没有顾客。似乎也没有多少员工在场，他们只看到一位女售货员和收银员。这位女售货员看起来无聊至极，正在玩手机，要么是在查看短信，要么是在玩游戏，完全没有注意到进店的团队。

Asuka however decided to change this and get some decent customer service. "A-HEM!" Asuka exclaimed rather loudly, startling the woman so much that she almost dropped her phone in surprise. After the initial shock and seeing the trio plus the small child, she took a second to put her phone away before quickly going over to them and presenting them with the classical retail smile.  
然而，Asuka 决定改变这一状况，获得一些像样的客户服务。“咳咳！”Asuka 大声地清了清嗓子，吓得那位女士差点把手机掉在地上。在最初的惊吓之后，看到三人加上一个小孩子，她赶紧把手机收起来，迅速走到他们面前，露出标准的零售微笑。

"Hello there, welcome to our store, how might we be of service?" the clerk said.  
“您好，欢迎光临本店，有什么可以为您服务的吗？”店员问道。

"Um hello there, we're looking for the clothing section for children age three to four," Shinji said to the female retailer (who, according to her name tag, was named Yua), while looking down at Aki who herself gave a small smile and a wave at the two female workers.  
“呃，您好，我们在找三到四岁儿童的服装区，”真嗣对那位女店员（根据她的胸牌，名叫优）说，同时低头看着阿基，阿基本人则向两位女店员微微一笑并挥了挥手。

"And which way is the older female section? This one needs a major wardrobe overhaul asap," Asuka proclaimed while pointing at Rei. Rei herself turned her head to Asuka looking slightly confused.  
“那么，女士大码区在哪个方向？这位急需马上换新衣，”明日香指着绫波宣称道。绫波自己转头看向明日香，显得有些困惑。

If the female worker was put off by Asuka impolite directness and demand, she didn't show it as she still had that smile on her face. "Well, you're all in luck as both children and women sections are right next to each other. Please follow me."  
如果那位女店员对明日香的不礼貌直率和要求感到不悦，她并未表现出来，脸上依旧挂着微笑。“好吧，你们真幸运，儿童区和女装区正好相邻。请跟我来。”

Following the woman, Asuka looked down at her daughter with a grin. "Ready to try on some new clothes, Schätzchen?"  
跟随着那位女士，明日香低头对着女儿咧嘴一笑。“准备好试穿新衣服了吗，宝贝？”

Aki grinned back at her raising her small fist. "YEAH!"  
阿基笑着举起她的小拳头回应。“耶！”

x-x-x-x-x-x

"I DON'T LIKE IT!" Aki yelled out a cry, echoing across the shop.  
"我不喜欢这个！" 阿基大声喊道，声音在店里回荡。

"Come on honey, it's not that bad." Shinji said trying to reason with his daughter who was not happy with the childish clothes and shoes she was currently trying on. "I mean this one has cute kittens on the top and you like kittens, don't you?"  
"好了，亲爱的，没那么糟糕。" 真嗣试图说服他的女儿，她对正在试穿的童装和鞋子很不满意。"我是说这件上衣上有可爱的小猫，你喜欢小猫，不是吗？"

Aki however gave Shinji a mean glare worthy of that of her mother before she took a deep breath. "I DON'T LIKE IT! I DON'T LIKE THE SHOES AND I WANNA CHOOSE MY OWN CLOTHES!" Aki screech was heard throughout the store.  
然而，阿基给了真嗣一个足以媲美她母亲的凶狠眼神，然后深吸了一口气。"我不喜欢这个！我不喜欢这双鞋，我要自己选衣服！" 阿基的尖叫声响彻整个商店。

Shinji sighed heavily at this. Both he and Asuka knew that this was gonna be difficult as they knew all too well that Aki preferred to wear the clothes she would choose which all tended to be big and more loose fitting. But now that they were no longer in a post third impact world they had to force this issue onto her in order to fit her into normal society. Truthfully a part of him was always concerned with this even back when it was just the three of them, but Aki's stubbornness and Asuka's dismissal of the whole thing made him also give up.  
真嗣对此重重地叹了口气。他和明日香都清楚，这将是一场艰难的挑战，因为他们深知阿基更喜欢选择那些宽松肥大的衣服。但现在，他们已不再身处第三次冲击后的世界，为了让她融入正常社会，他们不得不强迫她面对这个问题。说实话，即使在只有他们三个人的时候，他内心深处也一直对此感到担忧，但阿基的固执和明日香对此事的漠视，让他也选择了放弃。

He also wished that he weren't alone with this right now. Soon after finding clothes for Aki, Asuka gave Shinji the task to make Aki try on the clothes they chose for her while she accompanied (or more like forcibly dragged) Rei into the woman's section to find clothes for the blue haired teen. Shinji suspected that she did this on purpose to avoid becoming the bad guy in this situation.  
他也希望此刻自己不是孤身一人面对这一切。在为阿基挑选完衣服后不久，明日香便将让阿基试穿这些衣服的任务交给了真嗣，而她则陪同（或者说强行拖着）绫波去女装区为蓝发少女挑选衣服。真嗣怀疑她是故意这么做的，以避免在这件事中成为坏人。

It had been forty five minutes since he had last seen them and in that time he had made Aki try on dozens of kids clothes, all of which she hated and given her state she was on the verge of running off which again made him really wish he wasn't alone in case that were to happen.  
距离他上次见到他们已经过去了四十五分钟，在这段时间里，他让 Aki 试穿了几十件童装，每一件她都讨厌，而且以她现在的状态，她几乎要跑掉了，这让他再次希望自己不是一个人，以防这种情况发生。

"Is everything ok there, Shinji?" Asuka called out.  
“那边一切都好吗，真嗣？”明日香喊道。

Shinji turned and was thankful for Asuka and Rei walking towards them. He noticed Rei wasn't wearing her usual school uniform but was now wearing a pure white sundress, which Shinji had to admit looked beautiful on her.  
真嗣转过身，对明日香和绫波向他们走来感到欣慰。他注意到绫波没有穿她平常的校服，而是换上了一条纯白色的太阳裙，真嗣不得不承认，这裙子穿在她身上非常漂亮。

"Soo what do you think you two, does this look good on her?" Asuka asked while presenting Rei to the two.  
"那么，你们两位觉得呢，她穿这个看起来不错吧？" 明日香一边展示着绫波一边问道。

"Wow, Rei you look really pretty," Aki said in amazement.  
"哇，绫波，你看起来真漂亮，" 秋赞叹道。

"Yeah you look great in that, Ayanami," Shinji added in.  
"是啊，你穿那个很好看，绫波，" 真嗣补充道。

Asuka looked incredibly proud of herself and looked to Rei with a smug look on her face. "See Rei, told you that they would think it looks good on you too."  
明日香看起来对自己非常自豪，她得意地看向绫波，脸上带着得意的表情。“看吧，绫波，我就说他们也会觉得你穿起来很好看的。”

A small tint of a blush appeared on Rei's face. "Thank you."  
绫波脸上泛起一丝淡淡的红晕。“谢谢。”

Shinji noticed that Rei was holding a basket that had not only her old clothes but also something else that was coloured blue. "Did you get anything else, Ayanami?".  
真嗣注意到绫波手里提着一个篮子，里面不仅有她的旧衣服，还有一件蓝色的东西。“绫波，你还拿了别的什么吗？”

Rei nodded to him. "Yes, pilot Soryu recommended several items of clothing that she evaluated were suiting me the best. She also instructed me to keep this particular piece on me to wear out."  
丽向他点头。“是的，飞行员索留推荐了几件她认为最适合我的衣服。她还指导我随身携带这件特定的衣物，以便外出时穿着。”

Shinji nodded to that and was happy that Rei was experiencing new things and was thankful to Asuka for doing this for her.  
真嗣对此点头表示赞同，很高兴丽能体验新事物，并对明日香为她所做的一切表示感激。

"Soo how is it coming along here with Aki?" Asuka asked her husband.  
“那么，这里和阿基进展如何？”明日香问她的丈夫。

Shinji sighed again and Asuka knew it wasn't going so great since even she heard Aki shrieking from across the store. "That bad huh?" Asuka said.  
真嗣再次叹了口气，明日香知道情况不妙，因为她甚至能听到商店另一头阿基的尖叫声。“这么糟糕啊？”明日香说道。

"She hates everything that I put on her. Even the stuff which she liked the look off on the displays she hates having to put on. And don't get me started on the shoes," Shinji mildly complained to his wife.  
“她讨厌我给她试穿的每一件衣服。就连她在展示架上看着喜欢的，穿上后也讨厌。更别提鞋子了，”真嗣向妻子轻声抱怨道。

"Baka, of course she's gonna complain. The goal today was to find anything proper that fits her when she's out in public. At home she can dress in her usual rags if it makes her happy," Asuka told Shinji while picking up a child t-shirt and trousers set from their clothes pile. "Ok Schätzchen how about we try this…on?" Asuka trailed off, realizing that Aki was no longer with them.  
“笨蛋，她当然会抱怨。今天的目标是在她外出时找到合适的衣服。在家她可以穿她平常的破烂衣服，只要她开心，”明日香一边说着，一边从衣服堆里拿起一套儿童 T 恤和裤子。“好了，宝贝，我们试试这套……”明日香话音未落，意识到阿基已经不在他们身边了。

"Aki? Aki? AKI!" Asuka shouted in panic while both she and Shinji frantically looked in all directions. Shinji also noted that someone else was missing from their group.  
"Aki？Aki？AKI！" 明日香惊慌失措地大喊，她和真嗣都疯狂地四处张望。真嗣还注意到他们小组中还有一个人不见了。

"Rei's gone too," Shinji stated.  
"丽也不见了，" 真嗣说道。

"Do you think she's with Aki?" Asuka quickly asked still somewhat worried.  
"你觉得她会和 Aki 在一起吗？" 明日香迅速问道，仍然有些担忧。

"I'm sure she is. Remember we told her to always watch Aki and Rei always follows through," Shinji said while bringing out his cellphone and calling Rei's phone number. After a couple of rings the phone was picked up with a soft and familiar voice.  
"我确信她会的。记得我们告诉过她要时刻关注 Aki，而 Rei 总是能做到，" 真嗣说着拿出手机，拨打了 Rei 的电话号码。几声铃响后，电话被接起，传来一个柔和而熟悉的声音。

"Hello?" Rei answered over the phone.  
"喂？" Rei 在电话那头应答。

"Rei w..oh hey!" Shinji tried to answer but Asuka quickly snatched away the phone from his grasp and putting it up to her ear.  
"Rei，呃...哦，嘿！" 真嗣试图回应，但 Asuka 迅速从他手中夺过手机，贴到自己耳边。

"Rei, is Aki with you!?" Asuka demanded over the phone.  
"丽，明在你那里吗？" 明日香在电话那头质问道。

"Yes," Rei simply replied but it really calmed Asuka down knowing that the blue haired girl was with her baby girl.  
"是的，" 丽简单地回答，但得知蓝发女孩和她的宝贝女儿在一起，明日香确实感到安心。

"Oh dem Himmel sei Dank." Asuka let a huge sigh of relief. Shinji hearing this also let out his relief and took back his phone from Asuka's hand.  
"哦，谢天谢地。" 明日香长舒了一口气。听到这话，真嗣也松了口气，从明日香手中接过电话。

"Rei, where are you and Aki at?" Shinji asked the most important question.  
“丽，你和明在哪里？”真嗣问出了最关键的问题。

As he expected, Rei's answer was very direct. "We're on the second floor of this store, men's department."  
正如他所料，丽的回答非常直接。“我们在商店的二楼，男装部。”

"Ok stay right there, we're on our way right now," Shinji said and turned to Asuka. "They're on the second floor, the men's department."  
“好的，就在那里别动，我们马上过去，”真嗣说道，转向明日香。“他们在二楼，男装部。”

Not saying anything both teens rushed to the second floor and upon getting there, they saw Rei just standing alone next to discount clothes pile of men's clothes.  
两人一言不发，急忙冲上二楼，到达后，他们看到丽正独自站在一堆男士打折衣服旁边。

Wasting no time, Asuka grabbed Rei by the shoulders. "Rei where is she!?"  
阿斯卡毫不犹豫地抓住丽的肩膀。“丽，她在哪儿！？”

"She's in there." Rei pointed towards the discount clothes bin pile next to her, which both parents saw was moving and shifting for a moment before a familiar little girl burst out wearing a white greyish zipper hoodie jumper that was way too big for her, given how large the hood covered her whole head and the sleeves were too long for her little arms.  
“她在那儿。”丽指向她旁边的那堆打折衣服，两位家长看到那堆衣服动了一下，随即一个熟悉的小女孩穿着一件灰白色的拉链连帽衫跳了出来，那件衣服对她来说太大了，帽子完全遮住了她的头，袖子也太长，盖过了她的小胳膊。

"BOO!" Aki shouted in an attempt to scare everyone as she got out but was disappointed that it didn't have any effect on them. "Aww, I thought I'd got you."  
“呜哇！”Aki 大喊一声，试图吓唬大家，但失望地发现这招对他们毫无作用。“哎呀，我还以为能吓到你们呢。”

Asuka however was not in the mood. "Aki, why did you go off on your own? You know your not supposed too!" Asuka said as she slightly scolded her child.  
然而 Asuka 心情不佳。“Aki，你为什么要自己跑开？你知道你不应该这样做的！”Asuka 略带责备地对女儿说道。

Aki pouted at her Mama. "I wanted to find my own clothes. Oh and I wasn't on my own, Rei was with me." Aki said while pointing at her friend at the last part, believing she's gotten away with disappointing/worrying her parents.  
Aki 对着妈妈撅起了嘴。“我想自己找衣服嘛。哦，而且我不是一个人，Rei 跟我在一起。”Aki 说着，指了指最后一部分的朋友，以为自己已经逃过了让父母失望/担心的责任。

Asuka kept up her stern look for a moment before she, along with Shinji, sighed in sync. Her worries dissipating, Asuka moved to hold Aki tightly in a bear hug with Shinji wrapping his arms around both of them.  
明日香维持了一会儿她那严肃的表情，随后与真嗣同步叹了口气。她的担忧消散了，明日香走过去紧紧地抱住阿基，真嗣则用双臂环绕着她们俩。

"Oh Schätzchen, just don't wander off without telling me or Papa, ok?" Asuka whispered to her daughter while slightly rocking her.  
“哦，小宝贝，别不告诉我或爸爸就乱跑，好吗？”明日香低声对女儿说，同时轻轻摇晃着她。

"Ok Mama," Aki agreed before breaking out of the group hug of her parents before presenting the outfit she was currently wearing. "Can I keep the ghost costume, Mama, Papa?"  
“好的，妈妈，”阿基答应着，从父母的拥抱中挣脱出来，展示她现在穿的服装，“我可以留下这个幽灵服装吗，妈妈，爸爸？”

This gave two parents a small laugh while Rei grew a small smile of her own. "Honey, that's not a ghost costume, it's a hoodie," Shinji told Aki.  
这让两位父母轻声笑了出来，丽也露出了淡淡的微笑。“亲爱的，那不是鬼怪服装，只是件连帽衫，”真嗣对秋解释道。

"A hoodee?" Aki repeated while giving her current attire a look over, as well as lifting the hood up revealing her face fully. "Well I like it! Can I have it please, Mama, Papa?" Aki asked while giving her parents the puppy dog eyes look.  
“连帽衫？”秋重复着，同时审视着自己身上的装扮，还把帽子掀起来露出整张脸。“我喜欢！妈妈，爸爸，我可以留下它吗？”秋用那双小狗般的眼神望着父母恳求道。

Shinji was about to try to say that she couldn't but Asuka intervened quickly. "Ok Schätzchen, if you want it then you can have it, but you still have to have some of the clothes that we picked ok, sounds fair?" Asuka reasoned while she gave Shinji a knowing side wink to him which he understood that his wife was trying to compromise.  
真嗣正想开口说不能给她，但明日香迅速介入。“好吧，小宝贝，如果你真的想要，那就留着吧，但你还得穿我们挑的一些衣服，这样公平吗？”明日香一边说，一边向真嗣眨了眨眼，示意他在做妥协。

It seemed to be working as Aki pondered for a second before nodding, ultimately agreeing to the arrangement.  
似乎奏效了，Aki 沉思片刻后点头同意了这个安排。

After that, the gang decided that they had done enough for today, paid for the clothing and went home, with Rei having to take a different train to her apartment but not before bidding farewell to her friends though not before Asuka and Shinji reminded her of the date of the party.  
之后，大家觉得今天已经玩够了，付了衣服的钱便各自回家，Rei 需要搭乘另一班列车回公寓，但在告别朋友们之前，Asuka 和 Shinji 提醒了她派对的日期。

Upon arriving back at the Katsuragi apartment, with Aki doing a routine 'I'm home' greeting, they were met with Misato who looked like she had just come home from another day at NERV headquarters herself. PenPen who was seen only briefly seen running into his freezer upon hearing Aki's greeting, still somewhat afraid of three year old girl.  
回到 Katsuragi 公寓时，Aki 照例喊了声“我回来了”，迎接他们的是 Misato，她看起来像是刚从 NERV 总部下班回来。PenPen 只匆匆一瞥，听到 Aki 的招呼声后便跑进了冰箱，对三岁的小女孩仍有些许畏惧。

"Hey guys welcome home. How did the shopping trip go?" Misato asked.  
"嘿伙计们，欢迎回家。购物之旅怎么样？" 美里问道。

Aki responded to the question as best as an energetic kid would. "It was fun, auntie Misato! Me, Mama and Papa and Rei walked around and went on the big ca..train thingy and we went to the shopping mall which had lots of kinds of neat things. I got new colouring books and crayons and Mama, Papa and Rei got me new toys as well but I was only allowed a few things as my birthday is coming up really soon and they told me I'd had to wait to get more. Are you gonna get me something?"  
阿基以一个充满活力的孩子的最佳方式回答了这个问题。"很有趣，美里阿姨！我和妈妈、爸爸还有丽一起逛了逛，坐了那个大大的...火车，然后我们去了购物中心，那里有很多很酷的东西。我得到了新的涂色书和蜡笔，妈妈、爸爸和丽还给我买了新玩具，但我只能拿几样，因为我的生日很快就要到了，他们告诉我得等到那时候才能得到更多。你会给我买什么吗？"

"Uh…"

"Also Rei told me about why people need the yen paper even though I still don't understand why as Papa and Mama just took things without it before. I even got new clothes though I really, really didn't like the ones Papa and Mama choose for me but they said I had to now, oh, but I was able to find something for myself which I really liked all on my own which was a hoodee even though I thought it was a ghost costume at first."  
"还有，丽告诉我为什么人们需要日元纸币，尽管我还是不明白为什么，因为爸爸和妈妈以前都是直接拿东西的。我也得到了新衣服，虽然我真的很不喜欢爸爸和妈妈给我选的那些，但他们说我必须穿，哦，但我自己找到了一件我真的很喜欢的东西，那是一件连帽衫，虽然一开始我以为它是鬼怪服装。"

Misato chuckled at the long story Aki told, petting the brown haired girls head as she sat down on the chair at the kitchen table. "Sound like you you had a great day kiddo."  
美里对秋讲述的长故事轻声笑了起来，她坐在厨房桌旁的椅子上，抚摸着棕发女孩的头。“听起来你今天过得很棒，小家伙。”

"Yeah the best day ever!" Aki said out loud.  
“是啊，有史以来最好的一天！”秋大声说道。

### Chapter 5 Best Friend  
Chapter 5 位最好的朋友

"So…um you sure you don't want me to walk you all the way home?" Toji asked with a bit of nervousness as both of them walked down the street holding each other's hand.  
"所以……呃，你确定不要我陪你一直走回家吗？" 两人手牵手走在街上，Toji 带着些许紧张问道。

"Um...no, it's ok, I have to take a detour to the supermarket near mine get some ingredients for dinner tonight," Hikari replied just as shyly to her boyfriend, a statement that she was now both proud and embarrassed about. It was bad enough that their classmates had been teasing them on their relationship status since they openly announced it not long ago but at home Hikari didn't have any solace either, since her two sisters and even her own father wouldn't stop teasing as well about Toji.  
"嗯……不用了，没事的，我得绕道去我家附近的超市买点今晚做饭的食材，" Hikari 同样羞涩地回答她的男朋友，这个回答让她既自豪又尴尬。自从他们不久前公开恋情以来，同学们就一直拿他们的关系开玩笑，但在家里 Hikari 也没有安宁，因为她的两个妹妹甚至她自己的父亲也不断拿 Toji 来调侃她。

"Oh…ok then I guess I'll see you tomorrow class re…Hikari," Toji's said looking away while rubbing his neck, himself still getting used to having a girlfriend and calling her by her name as well rather then her class representative title.  
"哦……那好吧，那我猜明天课堂上见……Hikari，" Toji 说着，目光移开，同时揉着脖子，他自己还在适应有个女朋友以及称呼她的名字而不是她的班长头衔。

Hikari, seeing a golden opportunity to be more bold, gathered a bit of courage and promptly closed the distance between them and planted a soft and quick kiss on the boy's lips. An action that froze Toji on the spot and blushing up a storm for a moment before a happy and goofy smile brightened his face.  
光看到一个大胆行动的黄金机会，鼓起了一点勇气，迅速拉近了彼此的距离，在男孩的唇上轻轻快速地吻了一下。这一举动让东二当场僵住，脸红得像风暴一样，片刻后，一个快乐而傻气的笑容照亮了他的脸。

He wasn't the only one as Hikari, now with her courage having been used in such a daring move, was blushing even more than he was, before the embarrassment was too much and overtook her body. She detached her hand from his while turning in the opposite direction and sprinted down the road that would make any olympic track runner proud.  
他并不是唯一一个脸红的，光在如此大胆的举动后，勇气已经用尽，她的脸比他还红，随后羞涩感太过强烈，占据了她的全身。她松开他的手，转身向相反方向跑去，那速度足以让任何奥运田径选手感到自豪。

_'I can't believe I actually did something so bold! I'm soo sinful!'_ Hikari erratically thought as she continued to run straight to the supermarket near her home.  
“我真不敢相信我居然做了这么大胆的事！我真是太罪恶了！”光一边想着，一边继续直奔家附近的超市。

Once there, she was able to calm herself and proceeded to get everything needed for her family's dinner tonight. On her way back her mind was still thinking on how bold she was earlier with Toji.  
一到那里，她便能平复心情，开始为今晚家人的晚餐准备所需的一切。回家的路上，她的思绪仍停留在之前对冬治的大胆举动上。

_'Oh God I still can't believe I did something so bold! I mean how does Asuka and Ikari make it look so natural?'_ Hikari thought and upon thinking on the Ikari family she began wondering on her current relationship with them and more so with Asuka herself.  
'哦天哪，我还是不敢相信我做了那么大胆的事！我是说，明日香和碇怎么就能做得那么自然呢？' 光心想，想到碇家，她开始思考自己与他们的关系，尤其是与明日香的关系。

It was still a shock to her that Asuka and Ikari were time travellers. Both having come from an alternative timeline where the third impact actually occurred despite beating the angels and that the two had not only survived but settled down together and had a child together also. It was still hard to believe but the DNA test that Doctor Akagi took on Aki all but proved they were telling the truth.  
明日香和碇是时间旅行者，这仍让她感到震惊。两人来自一个平行时空，尽管击败了使徒，但第三次冲击还是发生了，他们不仅幸存下来，还安顿下来并共同抚养了一个孩子。这虽然难以置信，但赤木博士对阿基进行的 DNA 测试几乎证实了他们的说法。

It made Hikari wonder if Asuka was still her best friend. Asuka, while still physically a teenager is mentally an adult and on top of that she's also a mother too. Both her and Ikari seem to be in their own world at the moment and don't seem to show any intention of returning to school either. The thought further brought it home to her that Asuka was way more mature now and probably wouldn't want to be associated with a young naïve girl like herself.  
这让光不禁怀疑，明日香是否还是她最好的朋友。明日香虽然外表仍是少女，内心却已成熟，更是一位母亲。她和真嗣似乎都沉浸在自己的世界里，似乎也没有重返学校的打算。这让她更加意识到，明日香如今成熟得多，可能不再愿意与她这样天真幼稚的女孩为伍。

Just as these dark and depressing thoughts we're building up, Hikari neared the local kids playground and saw a few families there with their children playing around the area.  
正当这些阴暗压抑的思绪不断累积时，光走近了当地的儿童游乐场，看到几户家庭带着孩子在那里玩耍。

"Hikari?…Hikari over here!" A familiar voice called out to her making Hikari stop and turn to see. To her surprise, there was Asuka along with Shinji and Aki. Furthermore, both of them were wearing the same "adult" clothing that she and Toji had seen them wear on the first day school started back up. Aki herself was still wearing her blue kindergarten uniform along with the "magic" hat that Toji had given her.  
“光？……光，这边！”一个熟悉的声音呼唤着她，让光停下脚步转身望去。令她惊讶的是，明日香和真嗣还有绫在那里。而且，他们都穿着开学第一天她和冬二看到的那种“成人”服装。绫自己则依然穿着她的蓝色幼儿园制服，戴着冬二送给她的那顶“魔法”帽子。

"Oh…hi you guys" Hikari said a bit sheepishly as the three walked over to her. At the moment Hikari wanted to avoid them and was not prepared to face them this soon.  
"哦…嗨，你们好" 光有些尴尬地说道，看着三人向她走来。此刻，光本想避开他们，没想到这么快就要面对他们。

"Hi Hikari!" Aki greeted her with a big smile.  
"嗨，光！" 秋以一个大大的笑容向她打招呼。

"Hello there, Aki-Chan," Hikari gave her greeting back to the four year old along with a smile although the smile itself was kind of forced a little.  
"你好，秋酱，" 光回以问候，并努力挤出一个微笑，尽管这笑容略显勉强。

Aki was a sweet and cheerful kid no doubt about it, kind of like her own little sister Nozomi but she wished that Asuka and Ikari would install more manners into her. Especially after hearing some of the wild antics Aki got up to at kindergarten from her older sister Kodama, who still didn't know the secret that Aki was connected to her best friend yet. A part of her was dreading when Kodama would eventually figure it out and demand her sister to explain everything.  
毫无疑问，阿基是个甜美又开朗的孩子，有点像她自己的小妹妹希诺美，但她希望明日香和碇能教会她更多礼貌。尤其是从她姐姐小玉那里听说了阿基在幼儿园的一些疯狂行径后，小玉至今还不知道阿基与她最好的朋友之间的秘密。她的一部分在担心，当小玉最终发现真相并要求她妹妹解释一切时，她会怎么做。

"Mama, Papa, can I go play on the playground now?" Aki's question broke Hikari out of her thoughts and saw that girl was looking back and up at her parents.  
“妈妈，爸爸，我现在可以去操场上玩吗？”阿基的问题打断了光子的思绪，她看到那女孩正回头仰望着她的父母。

"Sure you can, Schätzchen." Asuka gave her daughter the go ahead before she turned to Shinji. "Shinji can you go with her while I talk with Hikari please?" Asuka asked to which Shinji nodded.  
“当然可以，宝贝。”明日香同意了女儿的请求，然后转向真嗣。“真嗣，你能陪她去吗？我和光子有话要说。”明日香问道，真嗣点了点头。

"Sure," Shinji said before grabbing Aki's eagerly waiting hand before the child quickly pulled him in the direction of the swing set. "It was nice seeing you class rep!" Shinji quickly shouted out as they got further away.  
“当然，” 真嗣说着，抓住了秋 eagerly 等待的手，孩子迅速拉着他朝秋千架的方向走去。“见到你真好，班长！” 真嗣在他们走远时迅速喊道。

Hikari saw Asuka look at her husband and daughter with content for a moment before turning back to her with a smile. "So shall we sit down over there?" Asuka asked, pointing at the bench at the park that was unoccupied. Upon Hikari nodding they both went and sat down.  
光看到明日香看着她的丈夫和女儿，脸上露出了满足的表情，然后转回身对她微笑。“那么我们去那边坐下吧？” 明日香指着公园里空着的那个长椅问道。光点头后，她们俩便走过去坐下了。

"So Hikari, how have things been lately with you?" Asuka asked her.  
“那么，光，你最近过得怎么样？” 明日香问她。

"Um... yeah things have been ok," Hikari told her.  
"嗯... 是的，一切都还好，" 光告诉她。

"Just ok? What about things going between you and the monkey boy? Normally you'd be gushing on and on about him by now on how much progress you made," Asuka said with a bit of mock glare, clearly not wanting to know too much of the details on her friend's relationship with the jock.  
"只是还好？那你和那个猴子男孩之间怎么样了？通常你现在会滔滔不绝地谈论你们之间的进展，" 明日香带着一丝假装的不悦说道，显然不想过多了解朋友和那个运动员之间的关系细节。

"Oh no, no, me and Toji are fine Asuka, in fact I made plenty of progress with him as of late," Hikari said with a small blush brightening her cheeks.  
"哦，不，不，我和东治很好，明日香，事实上，我最近和他进展得相当不错，" 光说着，脸上泛起了一抹淡淡的红晕。

"Oh mein Gott, you two haven't started doing "that" yet right!?" Asuka said while giving her friend a look of pure horror and disgust.  
"哦，我的天哪，你们俩还没开始做“那件事”吧！？" 明日香说着，向她的朋友投去了一个充满恐惧和厌恶的表情。

Hikari's blush even deeply then before at the insinuation. "Noo! Of course not, me and Toji have only just started kissing. I don't think I'm ready for "that" yet."  
光的脸红得比之前更厉害了，因为那暗示。"不！当然没有，我和阿薰才刚开始接吻。我觉得我还没准备好做“那件事”。"

'_Even if I would be ok with that kind of stuff if Toji really wanted to do it.'_ a dark and naughty part of her mind thought before Hikari quickly locked that part of herself back in its sinful cage.  
'即使如果阿薰真的想做那种事，我也不会介意。'她脑海中一个黑暗而淘气的部分想着，但光迅速将那部分自己锁回了那个罪恶的牢笼。

Asuka sighed in relief at her friends response. "That's good to know. Lord knows I didn't want to give you or the monkey boy any ideas in making babies and start a family anytime soon. That would totally make me a bad friend," Asuka added in.  
明日香松了一口气，听到朋友的回答。“知道这一点真好。天晓得我可不想给你们俩，尤其是那个猴子男孩，任何生儿育女、组建家庭的念头。那绝对会让我成为一个糟糕的朋友，”明日香补充道。

"Am I still your best friend Asuka?" Hikari said before realising what she blurted out and begun to look down at her lap in an attempt to hid her face.  
“我还是你最好的朋友吗，明日香？”光子说完才意识到自己脱口而出的话，开始低头看着膝盖，试图掩饰自己的脸。

"Wait…what!?" Asuka clearly surprised at her friends question.  
“等等……什么！？”明日香显然被朋友的问题惊到了。

Knowing that she in too deep to back out now, Hikari continued. "I mean you and Ikari-kun have been so busy lately and you also don't seem to plan on coming back to school, plus you are mentally older then me anyway and you even have daughter to take care off now. So it wouldn't surprise me if staying friends with a schoolgirl like me would be completely pointless since you're already a grownup." Hikari finished while looking away at the side, not wanting to meet the redhead's eyes.  
深知自己已深陷其中无法抽身，光继续说道：“我是说，你和真嗣君最近都忙得不可开交，而且你似乎也没打算回学校，再加上你心理年龄本来就比我成熟，现在还有女儿要照顾。所以，如果你觉得和一个像我这样的女学生保持朋友关系毫无意义，我也不会感到惊讶，毕竟你已经是个成年人了。”光说完，目光转向一旁，不愿与红发少女对视。

Asuka didn't say anything for a second, staring at Hikari for a moment before she sighed heavily, taking off her fake grownup glasses and undid her hair letting it flow down as normal.  
明日香沉默了一会儿，盯着光看了一会儿，然后重重地叹了口气，摘下那副装成熟的假眼镜，解开头发，让它自然垂落。

"Hikari, look at me." Asuka said softly while reaching out and grasp her friend's hands in her own and kept holding them while Hikari eventually did turn back to look at her.  
“光，看着我。”明日香轻声说道，伸出手握住朋友的手，紧紧握住，直到光最终转过头来看着她。

"You are my best friend, believe me Hikari. When it was only just me and Shinji living alone in that third impact world, you had no idea how much I missed you, wanting to desperately talk to you, especially on girl stuff that heaven forbid I could never directly talk to with Shinji about."  
"你是我最好的朋友，相信我，光。在那只有我和真嗣独自生活的第三次冲击后的世界里，你不知道我有多么想念你，多么渴望与你交谈，尤其是那些女孩子的话题，天知道我绝不可能直接和真嗣谈这些。"

Asuka's smile faltered a little bit as she looked towards Aki sitting on the swing, demanding to be pushed by her Papa. "Especially when I found out I was pregnant and I just couldn't bring myself to tell Shinji. Sure, it ended up fine, but then I would have given everything to be able to talk with you – even though I'm sure you would have given me an earful for days." Asuka chuckled a little bit which Hikari also ended up doing too, making her smile a bit also.  
明日香看着坐在秋千上，要求爸爸推她的阿基，她的笑容略显动摇。“尤其是当我发现自己怀孕了，却无法鼓起勇气告诉真嗣。当然，结果一切都好，但那时我愿意付出一切，只为能和你聊聊——尽管我确信你会连着几天对我唠叨个不停。”明日香轻笑了一声，光也跟着笑了起来，这让她的笑容也多了几分。

Seeing this Asuka continued. "I mean, sure, I am somewhat more older, more wiser than I look due to the whole mental time travel thing, which is all confusing, I know. But I'm not that old that I would even think of completely dump you as a friend. I just have priorities right now that need sorting out, especially regarding where we're gonna live and getting Aki settled into normal society."  
看到这一幕，明日香继续说道：“我是说，当然，由于那次精神时空穿越的经历，我看起来比实际年龄要成熟一些，这很令人困惑，我知道。但我还没老到会完全放弃你这个朋友的地步。我现在只是有一些需要理清的优先事项，特别是关于我们将在哪里生活，以及如何让阿基适应正常社会。”

"Wait, you're going to move out of Katsuragi's apartment too?" Hikari asked.  
"等等，你也要搬出草薙的公寓吗？" 光问道。

"Eventually yes, me and Shinji are still sorting things out but my main point is that you don't have to worry about losing our friendship, ok?" Asuka asked while she let go of Hikari's hand briefly before she leaned over and wrapped her arms around her best friend in a warm hug which Hikari did the same after a second pause.  
"最终是的，我和真嗣还在整理事情，但我的重点是你不必担心失去我们的友谊，好吗？" 明日香问道，她短暂地松开了光的手，然后俯身用双臂紧紧拥抱了她最好的朋友，光在短暂的停顿后也做了同样的动作。

"Thanks you, Asuka. I'm sorry for doubting or friendship," Hikari whispered out as she continued to hold her friend.  
"谢谢你，明日香。我很抱歉怀疑我们的友谊，" 光低声说道，她继续拥抱着她的朋友。

"You're welcome, Hikari. And thank you for being my best friend too," Asuka whispered back with a smile.  
"不客气，光。也谢谢你一直是我最好的朋友，" 明日香微笑着低声回应。

### Chapter 6 Dropping in to Visit  
Chapter 6 突然造访

"Do you think those two or even Miss Misato might know if the stuff that's been going round on the net is all true or not?" Kensuke asked Toji and Hikari as they walked down the road, on route to the Katsuragi/Ikari/Soryu apartment.  
"你觉得那两位，甚至美里小姐，会不会知道网上流传的那些事情到底是真是假？" 真嗣问着走在路上，正前往葛城/碇/惣流公寓的冬二和光。

"Kensuke, would you please shut up about that stuff?" Toji said, clearly annoyed as they neared the apartment complex. "You been going on and on about this non stop for days now."  
"健介，你能别再提那件事了吗？" 当他们走近公寓楼时，冬二明显不耐烦地说，"你这几天一直在不停地念叨这个。"

"Besides, even if Asuka, Ikari and Miss Katsuragi knew about that stuff, I doubt they would tell us anyway. It would be classified information." Hikari added in, hoping that the military enthusiast friend would drop the issue.  
"再说了，就算明日香、碇和葛城小姐知道那些事，我也怀疑他们会不会告诉我们。那肯定是机密信息。" 光补充道，希望这位军事迷朋友能就此打住。

"Well, technically since it's all over the internet, it's not exactly classified anymore." Kensuke countered with his logical reasoning while pushing back his glasses to his nose.  
"嗯，严格来说，既然这些信息已经在网上到处都是，那就不再是机密了。" 健介用他的逻辑推理反驳道，同时把眼镜推回鼻梁上。

"Kensuke!" Toji replied with warning tone that was telling him to drop it. Unfortunately it didn't seem to deter Kensuke.  
"健介！" 冬二用一种警告的语气回答，似乎在告诉他别再提了。不幸的是，这似乎并没有让健介退缩。

"Aww, come on guys, aren't you at least curious about it? I mean, what about that secret society Shinji and Asuka mentioned at the party. SEELE asn't it? That they were controlling everything since World War Two, many corrupt government officials, illegal weapons and technology, especially on the stuff about cloning people!" The bespectacled teen cried out, seemingly feeling both ecstatic and also terrified on the information he was able to find.  
"哎呀，拜托，伙计们，你们难道就一点不好奇吗？我是说，关于真嗣和明日香在派对上提到的那个秘密社团。是叫 SEELE 吧？他们从二战开始就一直在操控一切，许多腐败的政府官员，非法武器和技术，尤其是关于克隆人的那些事！" 戴着眼镜的少年喊道，似乎对自己找到的信息既感到兴奋又感到恐惧。

"Yeah, it's all crazy man and that's exactly why I'm choosing not to read up on it." Toji said.  
"是啊，这一切都太疯狂了，这正是我选择不去深入了解的原因。" 冬二说。

"Oh come on man, can't we just ask…!" Kensuke tried to continue but stopped when Hikari promptly stood in front of him with a mean glare, a glare he and Toji plus everyone else in their class was all to familar with, the dreaded class rep glare.  
"哎呀，拜托了，我们不能直接问…！" 健介试图继续说下去，但当光及时站在他面前，用一种凶狠的目光瞪着他时，他停了下来。这种目光他和真嗣以及其他所有同班同学都非常熟悉，那是可怕的班长瞪眼。

"Kensuke, enough is enough, we are going to visit our friends and I don't want another word from you on government conspiracies and such for the rest of this evening, plus Asuka and Ikari-Kun explicitly said before that they don't want to talk about any of that stuff around Aki-chan. Do you understand!" Hikari said with a raised voiced while poking his chest with a finger on the last sentence.  
"健介，够了够了，我们要去看望我们的朋友，今晚我不想再听到你关于政府阴谋之类的任何一句话，而且明日香和真嗣君之前明确说过，他们不想在光面前谈论这些。明白了吗！" 光提高了声音说道，最后一句还用手指戳了戳他的胸口。

"Yes ma'am!" Kensuke responded stiffly straightened up on the spot. Toji also did the same next to him despite not being the target of his girlfriend's wraith for once.  
"是的，女士！" 健介僵硬地原地挺直了身子。真嗣也紧随其后，尽管这次他女朋友并没有针对他。

Hikari seeing the result on not only Kensuke but her boyfriend too made her smirk in triumph but she quickly turned around as to not show it to the two boys before walking ahead of them.  
光看到不仅健介，连她男朋友的结果也让她得意地扬起嘴角，但她迅速转过身去，以免让两个男孩看到，然后走在他们前面。

"Jeez Toji your girlfriend is scary, even when out of the classroom." Kensuke whispered to his friend.  
“天啊，东治，你女朋友真可怕，即使在教室外也是。”健介低声对朋友说。

"Shut up man!" was Toji's only comeback to such a response.  
“闭嘴，伙计！”东治对这样的回应只有这一句回击。

Eventually all three got to the apartment complex and it was there that they saw a familiar face and blue hair waiting for the elevator to arrive.  
最终，三人都到达了公寓楼，在那里他们看到了一张熟悉的面孔和一头蓝发，正等着电梯的到来。

"Hey Ayanami!" Toji called out as he, Hikari and Kensuke slightly rushed to meet the former Eva pilot at the elevator.  
“嘿，绫波！” 当东治、光子和真希波稍微加快脚步走向前 EVA 驾驶员所在的电梯时，东治喊道。

Rei turned to see three familiar faces of her classmates. "Hello Miss Horaki, Mr Suzuhara and Mr Aida."  
绫波转身看到了三位同学熟悉的面孔。“你好，堀崎小姐，铃原先生和相田先生。”

"Hey Ayanami, are you on your way to see the married couple." Toji said.  
"嘿，绫波，你这是要去见那对新婚夫妇吗？" 东治说道。

"If your referring to Ikari-kun and Soryu-san then yes." Rei replied with her normal stoic expression.  
"如果你指的是碇君和惣流小姐，那么是的。" 绫波回答，依旧保持着她一贯的平静表情。

"Cool, all three of us were gonna pop in to see them too, as it's been awhile since we last saw them." Kensuke said.  
"太好了，我们三个也正打算去看看他们，毕竟已经有一段时间没见了。" 真希说。

"I see." Was Rei's only reply before turning back to wait for the elevator. As usual, the three always found it difficult and even still unnerving to talk with the blue haired girl even with all the recent stuff that's been happening around her at school as of late.  
"我明白了。" 丽只是简单地回答，然后转身继续等待电梯。像往常一样，这三个人总是觉得与蓝发女孩交谈很困难，即使最近学校里发生了那么多事情，与她交谈仍让人感到不安。

Eventually, all four got into the elevator and shortly arrived at the right floor level and were walking to the apartment.  
最终，四个人都进入了电梯，很快就到达了正确的楼层，并走向公寓。

"I wonder how everyone has been lately?" Kensuke asked out loud finally breaking the long silence.  
"不知道大家最近怎么样了？" 健介终于大声打破了长时间的沉默。

"They have been fine, Aki has gotten acclimated to her time in kindergarten, Ikari and Soryu have been well and Major Katsuragi has been continuing work within NERV headquarters." Rei answered Kensuke's question just as they arrived at the door.  
"他们一切都好，Aki 已经适应了幼儿园的生活，碇和惣流也都很好，葛城美里少校一直在 NERV 总部继续她的工作。" 他们刚到门口，绫波就回答了健介的问题。

"Oh…that's cool to hear." Kensuke said, clearly he didn't expect Rei to actually answer his question for real. A part of him was tempted to ask her specifically what work Miss Misato was doing but remembered the lecture/threat earlier and wisely kept his mouth shut.  
"哦……那挺好的。" 健介说，显然他没想到绫波真的会认真回答他的问题。他有点想问美里小姐具体在做什么工作，但想起了之前的警告，明智地闭上了嘴。

Rei pressed the doorbell to the Katsuragi/Ikari/Soryu apartment and shortly after heard footsteps approaching the door. Soon the door opened and to a bit of a surprise to everyone present it was Shinji who answered the door, all having expected Aki to be the one to greet them.  
绫波按下了葛城/碇/惣流家的门铃，不久就听到了脚步声朝门口走来。门很快开了，让在场的人都有些惊讶的是，开门的是真嗣，大家都以为会是 Aki 来迎接他们。

Upon seeing his friends, Shinji smiled at them. "Oh hi guys."  
看到朋友们，真嗣向他们微笑。“哦，嗨，大家好。”

"Good afternoon, Ikari." Hikari greeted with a traditional and formal bow.  
“下午好，碇君。”光用传统而正式的鞠躬问候道。

"Hey buddy, it's been awhile." Toji said.  
“嘿，兄弟，好久不见了。”冬二说道。

"Yeah, I guess it's has been awhile." Shinji replied before stepping to the side, giving them room to enter past him. "Please come in, I was about to get dinner started soon. Are you hungry?" Shinji asked while his friends came in, removing their shoes by the hallway.  
“是啊，我想确实有一阵子了。” 真嗣回答着，侧身让开，给他们留出进门的空间。“请进，我正准备开始做晚饭。你们饿了吗？” 真嗣问道，朋友们进来时在走廊脱掉了鞋子。

"Nah, I'm fine man. I'm still kind of bloated from Hikari's excellent bento from earlier." Toji said while Hikari showed a tiny blush at Toji's compliment of her cooking.  
“不用了，我挺好的。吃了光的好吃的便当，现在还有点撑。” 阿薰说着，光在他对她的厨艺的夸奖下微微脸红。

"It's cool Shinji, my dad's working late and he gave me some yen to get takeout later." Kensuke said.  
“没事，真嗣，我爸今晚加班，他给了我一些钱晚点买外卖。” 健介说。

"Thanks for the offer Shinji, but I have to decline also. I'm cooking for my family later." Hikari added her excuse politely.  
“谢谢你的邀请，真嗣，但我也要婉拒。我稍后要为家人做饭。” 光子礼貌地补充了她的理由。

Shinji nodded at his friends before turning to Rei. "What about you, Rei? I can cook up some vegetarian Stir-fry for you?" Shinji offered.  
真嗣向朋友们点头示意后，转向绫波。“那你呢，绫波？我可以为你做些素食炒菜。” 真嗣提议道。

Rei seemed to think on the offer given her slight pause but eventually nodded. "Yes please…thank you." Rei thanked him with a slight blush on her face.  
绫波似乎在考虑这个提议，她稍稍停顿了一下，但最终点了点头。“好的，谢谢你。” 绫波带着一丝脸红向他道谢。

"So buddy, where's Aki-chan?" Toji asked. "Normally she the one that's been answering the door lately."  
“那么，伙计，Aki 酱在哪儿？”冬二问道，“最近通常是她来开门。”

"Oh she's inside with Asuka. It's just that's she kind of busy creating another work of art as she called it." Shinji laughed slightly. Clearly Aki had been trying to improve her drawings after seeing Rei photorealistic ones.  
“哦，她和明日香在里面。只是她有点忙，说是正在创作另一幅‘艺术品’。”真嗣轻笑了一下。显然，在看到绫波的逼真画作后，Aki 一直在努力提升自己的绘画水平。

As the gang entered the apartment fully and saw Asuka sitting on the couch reading a magazine, PenPen watching some swimming event on TV while laying on a beanbag a bit further away and Aki was currently drawing on the floor. Asuka, upon hearing extra voices turned to see the gang and smiled and got up to greet them  
当大家完全进入公寓，看到明日香坐在沙发上读杂志，PenPen 躺在稍远处的豆袋上观看游泳比赛，而 Aki 正在地板上作画。明日香听到额外的声音，转头看到大家，微笑着起身迎接他们。

"Hey guys, nice to see you." Asuka happy replied while she gave Hikari a quick hug before her eyes turned to see Rei who nodded back to her. Eventually her eyes landed on to Toji and Kensuke, her face turned to a deadpanned expression. "Well most of you at least."  
"嘿，大家好，很高兴见到你们。" 明日香开心地回答，她迅速拥抱了光，然后目光转向了点头回应她的丽。最终，她的目光落在了真治和健介身上，脸上露出了死鱼眼般的表情。"嗯，至少大部分人。"

Toji was about to retort to that response but he was interrupted by Aki finally looking up from her drawings before she bolted up running to greet them, with her ending up hugging Rei's leg.  
真治正要反驳那个回答，但被秋终于从她的画作中抬起头来打断了，她猛地站起来跑去迎接他们，最后抱住了丽的腿。

"Rei! Hikari! Toji! Kenny!" Aki cheerily greeted them, though Kensuke's eye slightly twitched at her mistake on his name.  
"丽！光！真治！健介！" 秋欢快地向他们打招呼，尽管健介听到她叫错自己的名字时眼角微微抽搐。

"It's Kensuke, Aki-chan." Kensuke corrected the four year old.  
"是健助，秋酱。" 健助纠正了四岁的小秋。

"Oh…Ok Kensuke!" Aki happily corrected herself.  
"哦…好的，健助！" 秋开心地纠正了自己。

After that the gang all gathered around and sat down at the kitchen table, minus Rei and Aki who went to the living room due to Aki dragging Rei there to play with her.  
之后，大家围坐在厨房的桌子旁，除了丽和秋，因为秋拉着丽去了客厅，想和她一起玩。

"So how have you guys all been?" Shinji asked as he started preparing dinner.  
“那么，你们最近都怎么样？”真嗣一边问，一边开始准备晚餐。

Toji sighed heavily. "It's been the same old cra…stuff at school." Toji quickly interjected after Asuka gave a menacing look to him, making sure that he didn't curse in Aki presence. It also wasn't just Asuka giving him the look but Hikari (both for his near swearing and disrespect of the school) and even Shinji was giving him a disapproving look.  
剑介重重地叹了口气。“学校里还是那些破……事儿。”在明日香投来威胁的目光后，剑介迅速改口，确保在绫波面前没有说脏话。不只是明日香，光和真嗣也对他投以不赞同的眼神，既是因为他差点爆粗口，也是因为他对学校的不敬。

After moment Hikari finally let up on her boyfriend and decided to take over in continuing the conversation. "It hasn't been the same old stuff, Toji." Hikari lectured her boyfriend. "School has started getting more busy now and many of the other classes and other years are starting to fill up now that more students are coming in." Hikari said and looked at Asuka and Shinji. "It wouldn't surprise me if they will start giving away your place in class since you've been absent for so long."  
片刻后，光终于不再紧盯着自己的男友，决定接过话题继续聊下去。“事情并不只是老样子，剑介。”光向男友解释道，“学校现在越来越忙了，随着更多学生的到来，其他班级和其他年级也开始变得拥挤。”她看向明日香和真嗣，“你们缺席这么久，我猜他们可能会把你们的座位让给别人。”

Asuka and Shinji knew what Hikari was trying to say. If they wouldn't come back to school soon they might not be able to was what she is implying.  
明日香和真嗣明白光在暗示什么。如果他们不尽快回学校，可能就无法再回来了。

"Yeah and a lot of people are actually missing you guys and wondering where you are," Kensuke said before grinning. "It's just not the same without the class's bickering married couple." He teased the two and saw the couple blush a tint at that before they smiled briefly.  
“是啊，很多人都在想念你们，想知道你们去哪儿了。” 剑介笑着说，“没有你们这对爱斗嘴的小夫妻，班级都不一样了。”他打趣着两人，看到他们脸颊微微泛红，随即短暂地笑了笑。

"Not only that, but you guys not coming back has started everyone making assumptions and spread rumours. And why you haven't come back yet while Ayanami has." Hikari told the two.  
“不仅如此，你们不回来也引发了各种猜测和谣言。而且为什么你们还没回来，而绫波已经回来了。”光对两人说道。

"Heck it's gotten to the point that people have been asking us about you guys." Toji added in.  
"见鬼，人们已经开始向我们打听你们的情况了。" 冬二补充道。

"You guys haven't said anything, have you?" Shinji asked, a bit wary and afraid of the implications, especially if their friends told others about the whole time travel and more importantly about their daughter Aki.  
"你们没透露什么吧？" 真嗣问道，带着一丝警惕和担忧，尤其是怕朋友们把时间旅行的事，更重要的是关于他们的女儿明的事说出去。

"No, no, we haven't said anything other then the fact that you guys are alive and ok." Hikari reassured them.  
"没有，没有，我们只说了你们还活着，并且安然无恙。" 光子安慰他们。

"Yeah, even I'm not that stupid to mention the whole time travel thing as cool as the idea is. Even when you guys have at least one prove of evidence that confirms it's true." Kensuke said while giving a quick look to Aki who was drawing along with Ayanami.  
“是啊，我还没蠢到把时间旅行这种事当成酷炫的想法来提。即便你们至少有一份证据能证明这是真的。” Kensuke 说道，同时快速瞥了一眼正在和绫波一起画画的爱子。

"And it will stay unmentioned, Kensuke." Asuka slightly warned him as she saw him looking at her daughter. "So what kind of rumours is everyone talking about us at school then?" Asuka said, trying to move the conversation along while secretly wanting to hear the school gossip and rumour mill about them.  
“而且这事不会被提起的，Kensuke。” 明日香略带警告地对他说，注意到他看向自己的女儿。“那学校里大家都在谈论我们什么谣言呢？” 明日香试图转移话题，同时暗自想听听关于他们的校园八卦和流言蜚语。

"Well many of rumours are too far fetched and just downright crazy to even mention." Hikari said, having heard from other girls at school about the said rumours regarding the two Eva pilots.  
“嗯，很多谣言都太离谱了，简直荒谬到不值一提。” 光子说道，她从学校其他女生那里听到了关于这两位 EVA 驾驶员的种种谣言。

"But a few of those rumours are kind of hitting the nail near on the head. Like the two of you eloping and that Asuka is pregnant which in their minds explains why you guys haven't come back." Toji said and grinned at the slightly shocked and amazed expression on their faces. Clearly they were surprised on how near accurate the rumours were.  
“但其中有些传言倒是挺接近真相的。比如你们俩私奔了，还有说 Asuka 怀孕了，这在他们看来解释了为什么你们还没回来。”Toji 说着，咧嘴看着他们脸上略带震惊和惊讶的表情。显然，他们对这些传言的准确性感到惊讶。

"Oh mein Gott," Asuka grumble in despair while dropping her head on the table. "Now I'm happy that me and Shinji are not back at school."  
“哦，我的天哪，”Asuka 绝望地咕哝着，把头埋在桌子上。“现在我真庆幸我和 Shinji 没回学校。”

The three friends slightly laughed at the redhead's embarrassment. "I wouldn't worry about the rumours too much. They've become overshadowed by the things Ayanami's been doing lately." Toji said.  
三个朋友对红发女孩的尴尬微微一笑。“我倒不太担心这些传言。它们已经被 Ayanami 最近做的事情盖过了风头。”Toji 说。

"Wait, what things about Ayanami?" Shinji asked, a bit surprised to hear that about Rei.  
"等等，关于绫波的什么事？" 真嗣问道，听到关于绫波的消息有些惊讶。

It was Hikari, Toji and Kensuke to look at one another before answering. "Well Ayanami's been acting differently for the last few weeks now." Hikari told them.  
光、剑介和阿薰互相看了看，然后回答道："嗯，绫波这几周的行为变得很不一样。" 光告诉他们。

"Yeah like how she's been announcing when she comes into class as well as greeting people and it's kind of freaking everyone out." Toji added clearly remembering the first day when Rei greeted everyone good morning as she walked into class causing the whole room to gasp in shock, heck even one student fainted.  
"是啊，比如她现在进教室时会大声宣布，还会向大家打招呼，这让大家都有些不自在。" 剑介补充道，显然记得绫波第一次进教室时向大家问早安，整个教室的人都惊呆了，甚至有个学生直接晕倒了。

"Also she's been drawing top notch stuff during and after class rather then just stare out of the window all day. Heck, a few people have had the courage to ask her to make pictures of them and even the arts club is trying to recruit her to join it." Kensuke finished.  
"而且她在课间和课后都在画高质量的东西，而不是整天只是望着窗外发呆。天哪，有几个人甚至鼓起勇气请她为他们画像，就连艺术俱乐部也在试图招募她加入。" 健介说完。

This got the former two Eva pilots blinking in astonishment before both turning to Rei who was still keeping Aki entertained but knew the blue haired girl was listening to their conversation. "Rei, way didn't you say anything about this?" Asuka asked, clearly wondering why Rei hadn't mentioned all this before.  
这让前两位 EVA 驾驶员惊讶地眨了眨眼，然后两人都转向了绫波，她仍在逗弄秋，但知道蓝发女孩在听他们的对话。"绫波，你怎么没提过这件事？" 明日香问，显然在想为什么绫波之前没提到这些。

"I did not think it was that important." Was Rei's only answer. Asuka and Shinji figured that this was all they were gonna get out of the blue haired girl.  
"我认为这并不重要。" 绫波只回答了这一句。明日香和真嗣明白，这是他们能从蓝发女孩那里得到的全部信息了。

"Besides all that, seriously when are you guys planning to come back? I mean are you coming back to school at all right?" Hikari asked honestly, a bit afraid of the answer.  
“除了这些，你们到底打算什么时候回来？我是说，你们还打算回学校吗？”光真诚地问道，对答案有些忐忑。

"We're sorry guys, it's just we're so preoccupied with stuff at this time that school is still the last thing on our minds." Asuka said apologetically before continuing. "With having Aki settled now in kindergarten and the main reason that we're going to have to move out of the Misato's apartment soon."  
“我们很抱歉，只是现在我们有很多事情要忙，学校仍然是我们最后考虑的事情。”明日香歉意地说，然后继续道，“现在阿基已经在幼儿园安顿好了，主要原因是，我们很快就得搬出美里小姐的公寓了。”

This slightly shocked the three friends giving there wide eyed expressions. """Wait you guys moving out!?""" All three of their friends said.  
这消息让三位朋友震惊得瞪大了眼睛。“等等，你们要搬走？！”他们异口同声地说。

"Yeah me and Asuka are moving to the outskirts of the city. To the house we lived in the alternative Third Impact future," Shinji explained. "We've already talked to the original owners and have decided to go through with the offer."  
"是啊，我和明日香要搬到城市的郊区去。搬到我们在替代第三次冲击未来中住过的那栋房子，" 真嗣解释道。"我们已经和原主人谈过了，决定接受他们的提议。"

"Yeah and we can't stay here for much longer anyway since Misato gonna need the space." Asuka added in.  
"对啊，反正我们也在这里住不了多久了，因为美里小姐很快就需要这个空间了。" 明日香补充道。"

"Wait, what do you mean Miss Misato will need the space?" Toji questioned.  
"等等，你说的美里小姐需要空间是什么意思？" 冬二问道。"

At that Asuka and Shinji looked at each other, mentally communicating on whether to tell their friends of their guardian's status. Ultimately, they both came to an agreement as both of them nodded.  
此时，明日香和真嗣对视一眼，心中交流是否要告诉朋友们他们监护人的身份。最终，他们达成了一致，两人都点了点头。

"Well, the reason being that Misato is pregnant." Shinji said.  
“嗯，原因是因为美里怀孕了。”真嗣说道。

""WHAT! MISS MISATO IS PREGNANT!?"" Toji and Kensuke both screamed out in shock, obviously both boys still had a lingering crush on the purple haired woman. Hikari was more reserved as she only brought her hands to cover her mouth in shock before finding her voice again.  
“什么！美里小姐怀孕了！？” 冬二和健介同时惊呼出声，显然这两个男孩对那位紫发女子仍怀有未消的情愫。光则是更为克制，她只是用手捂住嘴表示震惊，随后才找回了自己的声音。

"Tha…that's wonderful news! We'll have to congratulate her when I see her." Hikari said. "So who is the father? Is it Mr Kaji?" Hikari asked to which she got her answer with Asuka and Shinji nodding yes.  
“那…那真是好消息！我见到她时得祝贺她。”光说。“那么，孩子的父亲是谁？是加治先生吗？”光问道，得到了明日香和真嗣点头肯定的回答。

""Lucky bastard."" Toji and Kensuke whispered under their breath though not quietly enough since Hikari ended up giving Toji a hard pinch at his side out of annoyance and jealousy, making him yelp in pain.  
“幸运的混蛋。” 阿薰和健介低声嘀咕，但声音不够小，因为光出于恼怒和嫉妒，狠狠地掐了阿薰的腰侧，让他痛得叫出声来。

Before anyone could say anything else, they heard Aki gasp and cry out.  
在其他人能说些什么之前，他们听到阿基倒抽一口气并哭喊出声。

"MY SHOW, MY SHOW IS ON!" Aki cried out before everyone turned to see the little girl snatching the TV remote from an irritated PenPen and switching to a different channel, which from what everyone could see was a children's show with some cute bear mascot in front of a group of children on stage.  
“我的节目，我的节目开始了！”阿基大喊一声，众人转头看到小女孩从恼怒的彭彭手中夺过电视遥控器，切换到了另一个频道，从画面上看，那是一个儿童节目，一只可爱的熊吉祥物站在舞台上的孩子们面前。

"Ok kids just follow the me and the beat of the music." The costumes mascot said on the TV as the music started to pick up. At the same time everyone saw Aki copying the moves of the said mascot on TV.  
“好的孩子们，跟着我和音乐的节奏。”电视上的吉祥物服装说道，随着音乐节奏加快，大家看到阿基正在模仿电视上那只吉祥物的动作。

"This is it. Here we go! 1, 2, 3, Dance dance dance dance like you want to win! Dance dance dance dance like you want to win!" The TV mascot sang out as she was dancing, making the children on stage copying her.  
“就是现在，我们开始吧！1、2、3，跳舞跳舞跳舞，就像你想赢一样！跳舞跳舞跳舞，就像你想赢一样！”电视上的吉祥物边唱边跳，舞台上的孩子们也跟着她一起跳。

"Dance dance dance dance, like I want to win! Dance dance dance dance like I want to win!" Aki repeated and copied the movements while keeping a look of focused determination as she watched the screen.  
"跳舞跳舞跳舞，就像我要赢一样！跳舞跳舞跳舞，就像我要赢一样！" 亚纪重复着，模仿着动作，同时保持着专注决心的表情，眼睛紧盯着屏幕。

This display got a laugh out of everyone present in the apartment, even Rei showed a genuine smile at the little girl's cute dance display.  
这一幕让公寓里的每个人都笑了起来，甚至连丽也对这个小女孩可爱的舞蹈展示露出了真心的微笑。

"Oh my god that's so adorable," Hikari said while her laughter died down a little. "What is she watching anyway?"  
"哦天哪，太可爱了，" 光笑着说，笑声稍微减弱了一些。"她到底在看什么呢？"

"Oh it's just some kids show. I can't remember the name but it's been around for years. Even my little sis used to watch this." Toji said.  
"哦，这只是个儿童节目。我记不清名字了，但它已经播出很多年了。就连我小妹以前也常看这个。" 真嗣说。

"Hey, wait a minute. Doesn't this music and beat feel familiar, Shinji?" Asuka asked as the music and its beat brought up a familiar feeling.  
"嘿，等一下。这音乐和节奏感觉很熟悉，对吧，真嗣？" 明日香问道，音乐和节奏唤起了她熟悉的感觉。

"Yeah, now that you mention it, it sort of reminds me of the music we were forced to listen to during our sync training for the seventh Angel." Shinji said now clearly remembering the music back then.  
"是啊，你这么一说，它确实让我想起了我们在第七使徒同步训练时被迫听的音乐。" 真嗣现在清楚地记起了那时的音乐。

And just like that it dawned on the two former pilots that Kaji and Misato's plan to beat the Angel partially came from a damn kids TV show!  
就这样，两位前飞行员突然意识到，加持和美里击败使徒的计划竟然部分源自一部该死的儿童电视节目！

X-X-X-X-X

At the same time at NERV headquarters both Misato and Kaji felt a chill up their spine and getting the feeling that trouble was going to happen upon returning to the apartment.  
与此同时，在 NERV 总部，美里和加持同时感到脊背发凉，心中隐隐觉得回到公寓后会有麻烦发生。

If your all wondering what kind of dance Aki is doing in this chapter, just look up "Mashiro-Tan Dancing" on Youtube and you'll get the picture.  
如果你好奇在chapter中阿基跳的是什么舞，只需在 YouTube 上搜索“Mashiro-Tan Dancing”，你就能一目了然。

### Chapter 7 Sugar Rush

"You doing ok, Shinji?" Asuka said teasingly.  
"你还好吗，真嗣？" 明日香打趣地说道。

"Ahh…yeah..I'm..doing..just..fine..Asuka." Said a straggling Shinji who was carrying four big and heavy plastic bags of their grocery shopping.  
"啊……嗯……我……我……还……好……明日香。" 真嗣吃力地说，他正提着四个又大又重的塑料袋，里面装满了他们的杂货。

"Well ok, let me know when your done trying gain some extra muscle, Shinji." Asuka said while giving Shinji a knowing smirk.  
"好吧，等你练完肌肉再告诉我，真嗣。" 明日香说着，给了真嗣一个意味深长的微笑。

Shinji slightly blushed at his wife's teasing. Yeah it was no lie that he was desperately trying to improve himself physically, especially after a comment from Aki a few days ago, who was disappointed that Papa wasn't able to carry her like he used to do anymore.  
真嗣被妻子的调侃弄得微微脸红。没错，他确实在拼命努力提升自己的体能，尤其是在几天前，阿基失望地说爸爸再也抱不动她了，这让他特别在意。

This had hurt his pride as a father and he also definitely missed the times where he could easily carry his little sunshine without so much as a strain. Obviously the blame was the whole mental time travel thing and it wasn't his fault on how things turned out.  
这伤了他的父亲自尊，他也确实怀念那些能轻松抱起小太阳般的女儿而不费吹灰之力的时光。显然，这一切都要归咎于那次精神时空穿越，事情的发展并非他的错。

Yet despite this Shinji had been doing more attempts to strengthen himself, by secretly trying to do exercises without letting anyone noticing, even trying to indirectly asks Toji on his exercise regimen. This secrecy unfortunately didn't last as Asuka had caught him red handed trying to do push ups alone in their room which she found both incredibly funny but also really sweet of him, knowing that the main reason he was doing it was due to Aki's off handed comment.  
尽管如此，真嗣还是在尝试增强自己，偷偷做着锻炼，不让任何人发现，甚至试图间接向冬治请教他的锻炼计划。可惜，这份秘密并未持续多久，因为明日香当场抓到他在房间里独自做俯卧撑，这让她觉得既好笑又非常暖心，知道他这么做主要是为了回应阿基随口的一句话。

None the less Shinji was determined to gain enough strength to make his little girl happy and Asuka too as even he could tell that his wife was also missing his big and more muscular frame.  
尽管如此，真嗣决心获得足够的力量，让他的小女儿开心，也让明日香开心，因为他也能看出，他的妻子也在怀念他那高大且更加健壮的身躯。

The two didn't say anything for the rest of the journey home, other than Shinji struggling with the bags, falling into a comfortable silence as the sun began to set in the horizon. A part of them was tempted to stay out a bit longer and enjoy the evening with just the two of them having a romantic outing, even if it was just laying on the grass watching the stars together.  
回家的路上，两人没有再说什么，除了真嗣努力提着袋子，随着太阳开始在地平线上落下，他们陷入了一种舒适的沉默。他们的一部分渴望在外面多待一会儿，享受这个夜晚，即使只是躺在草地上一起看星星，也算是浪漫的约会。

Ultimately they both decided to be responsible parents and to keep going as Aki would be hungry and waiting for them. Never mind Misato likely to chew them out for making her babysit longer then she already has, which if both teens remembered correctly, had been almost couple of hours since they set out for the shopping.  
最终，他们都决定做一个负责任的父母，继续前行，因为秋会饿着肚子等他们。更别提美里可能会因为他们让她照看孩子的时间比原计划长而责骂他们，如果两个年轻人记得没错的话，他们出门购物已经快几个小时了。

They soon arrived at the apartment complex and got into the elevator.  
他们很快到达了公寓大楼，并进入了电梯。

"Seriously I can't believe that you bought something this expensive." Asuka complained, making Shinji turn to face Asuka and saw her looking more closely at the only bag she was holding throughout the journey. "Like six thousand yen for a case of glow in the dark colouring pens." Asuka said before giving Shinji a look. "Honestly, you really like to spoil her don't you?"  
"说真的，我简直不敢相信你买了这么贵的东西。" 明日香抱怨道，让真嗣转过身来面对明日香，看到她更仔细地看着一路上她一直拿着的唯一一个袋子。"就像六千日元买了一盒夜光彩色笔。" 明日香说完后给了真嗣一个眼神。"老实说，你真的很宠她，不是吗？"

"But..but Aki has been doing so well at kindergarten and I just thought that she deserved something nice as a reward for being so good…and she really wanted them to." Shinji tried to feebly explain his reasons to his wife. Asuka just sighed in resignation, a soft smile appearing after.  
"但是...但是秋在幼儿园表现得那么好，我只是觉得她应该得到一些好东西作为对她表现出色的奖励...而且她真的很想要它们。" 真嗣试图向妻子解释他的理由。明日香只是叹了口气，表示无奈，随后露出了一个温柔的微笑。

She couldn't really fault her darling idiot husband, knowing too well that it was hard to deny Aki anything. Shinji did remember clearly last week when Aki saw the toy commercial on TV and squealed in delight when the glow in the dark pens were shown. When Aki told him about them and desperately wanted them for herself like any excited child. Shinji at first was wary due to the high price for a pack of colouring pens containing thirty different colours. He only calmed an excited Aki down by telling her that he would buy them if she continued to be good in kindergarten.  
她实在无法真正责怪她那可爱的傻瓜丈夫，深知要拒绝 Aki 任何事情是多么困难。上周，当 Aki 在电视上看到玩具广告，看到夜光笔时兴奋地尖叫起来，这件事真嗣记得很清楚。当 Aki 向他提起这些笔，并像任何一个兴奋的孩子一样迫切想要拥有它们时，真嗣起初因为一包包含三十种不同颜色的彩色笔价格昂贵而犹豫。他只能通过告诉 Aki，如果她在幼儿园继续表现良好，他就会买给她，来安抚激动的 Aki。

Aki did keep her word and did very good in kindergarten that following week, telling both her parents proudly that she had gotten a happy smile gold star for one of her drawings. So as a proud father how could he not reward his little girl.  
Aki 确实遵守了诺言，在接下来的一周里在幼儿园表现非常出色，自豪地告诉她的父母，她的一幅画获得了一颗代表快乐微笑的金色星星。作为一位骄傲的父亲，他怎能不奖励他的小宝贝呢。

The two exited the elevator and walked towards the apartment door and just as the door opened, they were already met by their purpled haired guardian, slightly making both former pilots jump.  
两人走出电梯，走向公寓门，就在门打开的那一刻，他们已经遇到了他们紫发的守护者，这让两位前驾驶员都微微一惊。

"OH THANK GOD YOUR BACK!" shouted a hysterical Misato, who looked like she had been put through ringer. Shinji and Asuka saw that Misato's hair was in a mess, her clothes were stained all over the front and the older woman's face looked like it was doodled on by pen marks of different colours.  
"哦，谢天谢地，你终于回来了！" 一个歇斯底里的美里喊道，她看起来像是经历了一场磨难。真嗣和明日香看到美里的头发凌乱不堪，衣服前襟沾满了污渍，而这位年长女性的脸上仿佛被不同颜色的笔胡乱涂鸦过。

"Misato, what's wrong? What happened!?" a concerned Shinji asked as he put the grocery bags on the floor.  
"美里，怎么了？发生了什么事！？" 真嗣关切地问道，同时将购物袋放在地板上。

"Shinji, Asuka, Aki is... Aki is..." Misato said before she quickly wrapped her arms around both of them and to their surprise, the purpled haired woman started to sob.  
"真嗣，明日香，Aki 她... Aki 她..." 美里说着，突然紧紧抱住他们两人，令他们惊讶的是，这位紫发女子开始抽泣起来。

"Aki!? What happened Misato is she ok!?" Asuka now greatly worried more than before she pushed Misato off of them and grabed her shoulders tightly. "ANSWER ME!?"  
"Aki!? 发生了什么事？美里她还好吗！？" 明日香此刻比之前更加担忧，她推开美里，紧紧抓住她的肩膀。"回答我！？"

Rather than explaining the situation to the two worrying parents, Misato quickly grabbed their arms and pulled them inside, which unfortunately made Shinji drop their shopping, bringing them further into the apartment. Upon arriving to the kitchen area they saw to their surprise and horror that the entire place was trashed.  
美里并没有向两位忧心忡忡的父母解释情况，而是迅速抓住他们的手臂，将他们拉进屋内，不幸的是这让真嗣手中的购物袋掉落，使他们更深入公寓。一进到厨房区域，他们惊讶且恐惧地发现整个地方都被毁了。

"Oh mein Gott im Himmel! What the heck happened here!?" Asuka exclaimed in disbelief while Shinji looked on in horror at the state of the whole apartment, colour draining from his face.  
"哦，我的天哪！这里到底发生了什么！？" 明日香难以置信地喊道，而真嗣则惊恐地看着整个公寓的惨状，脸色变得苍白。

The kitchen had all the cupboards opened, the table and chairs where either flipped or knocked down onto their sides, what little food that was in the apartment before they left was all over the floor and walls along with all the kitchen utensils too and that all around Aki's picture drawings and crayon and pen marks where all over place too. The two teen parents also saw PenPen laying next to his freezer looking traumatised as he was slowly rocking back-and-forth and looked like he was crying with doodle arks all over him too.  
厨房里的所有橱柜都被打开了，桌椅要么被掀翻，要么侧倒在地，他们离开前公寓里仅有的那点食物，连同所有的厨房用具，全都散落在地板和墙壁上，还有 Aki 的画作、蜡笔和笔迹也遍布各处。两位青少年父母还看到 PenPen 躺在他的冰箱旁，看起来受到了惊吓，慢慢地前后摇晃，似乎在哭泣，身上还布满了涂鸦的痕迹。

As they went further in they saw the living room was also in a bad state with all the cushions and the bean bags all having been ripped open leaving feathers and bean bag fillings all over the place, nearly all of Aki's toys that had been in her room were now scattered around the living room, the TV was on its side with nothing but static on the screen and like the kitchen Aki's pictures and coloured crayon and pen draws all over the floor walls…and even the ceiling too!?  
他们继续深入，发现客厅同样一片狼藉，所有的靠垫和懒人沙发都被撕开，羽毛和填充物散落一地，Aki 房间里的几乎所有玩具现在都散布在客厅里，电视侧翻在地，屏幕上只有静态雪花，和厨房一样，Aki 的画作、彩色蜡笔和笔迹遍布地板、墙壁，甚至天花板上！？

Both Shinji and Asuka also took a quick peak down the hallway and bathroom and saw what they had feared that they too were in in complete disarray with again Aki's trademark pictures and drawings on the all over. The bathroom unfortunately looked trashed with what sounded like running water still on and the hallway and a huge buildup of bubbles coming out of there.  
真嗣和明日香也迅速瞥了一眼走廊和浴室，看到了他们最担心的情况：这里同样一片狼藉，到处都是秋的标志性涂鸦和画作。不幸的是，浴室看起来像是被洗劫过，水声依旧哗哗作响，走廊里还涌出了大量的泡沫。

"Aki! Where are you!?" Asuka called out to her daughter, seeing that she was nowhere in sight. To her relief she heard footsteps running from one of the bedrooms coming towards them. Misato paled before getting behind both her wards for cover just as Aki reemerged and both parents saw that Aki was naked with doddles drawing all over her body.  
“秋！你在哪儿！？”明日香呼唤着女儿，却不见她的踪影。让她松了口气的是，她听到了从一间卧室传来的跑步声，正朝他们这边过来。美里脸色苍白，赶紧躲到两个孩子的身后寻求掩护，这时秋再次出现，两位家长看到秋全身赤裸，身上满是涂鸦。

Aki seeing her Mama and Papa squealed in delight before running over to them and kept running around them in circles at fast speed.  
秋看到爸爸妈妈，高兴地尖叫起来，然后跑向他们，快速绕着他们转圈。

"Mama, Papa, Mama, Papa, Mama, Papa, you're home you're home you're home, yeeeaaahhh!" Aki rapidly said before she stop running in circles but now was continuously hopping up and down on the spot while looking up at them expectedly.  
"妈妈，爸爸，妈妈，爸爸，妈妈，爸爸，你们回家了，回家了，回家了，耶！" 阿基迅速地说着，停止了绕圈跑，现在不停地在原地跳上跳下，期待地抬头看着他们。

"Um, Aki, honey, are you ok?" Shinji asked his daughter in concern. He knew Aki was very energetic but the way she was currently acting was beyond anything he or Asuka have ever seen her being.  
"呃，阿基，宝贝，你还好吗？" 真嗣担心地问他的女儿。他知道阿基精力充沛，但她现在的行为方式超出了他和明日香以往所见。

"YEAH! I'M SUPER, MEGA, ULTRA, HYPER HAPPY PAPA!" Aki shouted out. "I want to run and go play at the park, climb a tree and fly to the moon and play among the stars!" Aki explained loudly of her intentions before quickly tap her hand to her father's leg. "TAG PAPA YOU'RE IT! NOW CATCH ME, CATCH ME, CATCH ME, CATCH ME!" Aki shouted before once again running around them and all over the apartment while giggling madly, never noticing that her Papa wasn't actually moving to try and catch her.  
"耶！我超级，超极，超超超开心，爸爸！" 阿基大声喊道。"我想去公园跑步，爬树，飞到月球上，在星星间玩耍！" 阿基大声解释她的意图，然后迅速拍了拍她父亲的腿。"抓我，爸爸，你被点到了！现在抓我，抓我，抓我，抓我！" 阿基喊着，再次在他们周围和整个公寓里疯跑，咯咯笑着，完全没有注意到她的爸爸并没有真正移动去抓她。

Watching their daughter run around for a moment before turning their eyes to Misato, both Shinji and Asuka once again had to ask her. ""Misato what happened here!?"" they said in sync with a bit of anger in their tone, clearly wanting an explanation.  
看着他们的女儿跑来跑去一会儿后，碇真嗣和明日香再次将目光转向美里，不得不再次问她。“美里，这里发生了什么？！”他们异口同声地说，语气中带着一丝愤怒，显然想要一个解释。

"I…I don't know what happened!? After you guys left to get groceries, she came to me as I was filling my reports complaining that she was really thirsty so went up to get her a glass of water since we had no juice and when I came back to give it to her I saw her taking a sip of one of my energy drinks I left in my room and after not even a minute she..she just exploded!" Misato explained before taking a deep breath to continue. "She ended up drinking the whole can and now won't stop running around and I've I tried everything I could think of to get her to calm down but nothing is working! She is killing me and...the look at this place! It's completely tra..tra..trashed." Misato whined as she looked around the apartment, seeing the destruction before once again sobbing in her hands.  
“我……我不知道发生了什么？！你们去超市后，她来找我，当时我正在填写报告，抱怨说她非常渴，所以我们没有果汁，我就上楼去给她拿了一杯水。当我回来给她时，我看到她在喝我留在房间里的一罐能量饮料，不到一分钟她……她就爆炸了！”美里解释道，然后深吸一口气继续说，“她喝完了整罐，现在不停地跑来跑去，我试了我能想到的一切办法让她冷静下来，但什么都没用！她快把我逼疯了，还有……看看这个地方！完全是一片狼藉。”美里抱怨着环顾公寓，看到破坏的景象，再次用手捂脸哭泣。

"Misato, why didn't you call us?" Shinji asked, wondering why they weren't called sooner.  
“美里，你为什么不给我们打电话？”真嗣问，想知道为什么他们没有被早点叫来。

"I tried! The little terror took my flip phone!" Misato exclaimed. "I can't find it in this mess and Aki even disconnected and took the apartment phone too."  
"我试过了！那个小魔头拿走了我的翻盖手机！" 美里惊呼道。"我在这堆乱七八糟的东西里找不到它，而且明日香甚至还拔掉了电话线，拿走了公寓的电话。"

Still trying to process everything and still watching Aki run around endlessly, Shinji took the time to ask Misato another question.  
仍然试图理清一切，同时看着明日香无休止地跑来跑去，真嗣趁机向美里提出了另一个问题。

"Misato, what exactly was the energy drink she had?"  
"美里，她喝的那个能量饮料到底是什么？"

Misato quickly went to to her room and came back with the now empty can and handed it to Shinji. "It was this. When I gave up beer for obvious reasons I started using these types of drinks as a substitute, though I stopped using these when I figured out I was pregnant. I even forgot that I had this one can in there." Misato explained.  
美里迅速回到自己的房间，拿着一个空罐子回来了，递给真嗣。“就是这个。出于明显的原因，我戒了啤酒，开始用这类饮料作为替代品，不过当我发现自己怀孕后，就停止使用了。我甚至忘了里面还有这一罐。”美里解释道。

Inspecting the can, Shinji gasped when he read the ingredients listed on it. "Dear God. No wonder Aki is so hyper. The caffeine and sugar levels in this are way too high even for an adult!"  
真嗣仔细检查着罐子，当他看到上面的成分列表时，不禁倒吸一口凉气。“天哪，难怪阿基这么亢奋。这上面的咖啡因和糖分含量对成年人来说也太高了！”

Taking the can from her husband, Asuka also looked at the listing herself and gasped also. "Mein Gott, Misato! We're you trying to get yourself fat and get diabetes with this!?"  
从丈夫手中接过罐子，明日香也自己看了看列表，同样惊呼出声。“我的天，美里！你这是想让自己变胖还患上糖尿病吗？！”

"Hey will you get off my back. I said I stopped drinking these when I found out I was pregnant, and I didn't know I had a can left over in my room." Misato tried to defend herself.  
"嘿，你能不能别再唠叨我了。我说过自从发现自己怀孕后就不再喝这些了，而且我也不知道房间里还剩下一罐。" 美里试图为自己辩解。

"With the way your room always is I'm surprised there isn't a dead animal buried in there as well." Asuka said.  
"就你那房间的乱劲儿，我真惊讶里面居然没埋着个死动物。" 明日香说道。

"Oh like your room was any better than mine before you and Shinji started sharing." came the comeback from Misato.  
"哦，就像你和真嗣开始同居前，你的房间比我的好到哪儿去似的。" 美里回击道。

"What was that!?" “那是什么！？”

"Ah ladies?" Shinji interjected.  
“啊，女士们？”真嗣插话道。

""WHAT!?"" Asuka and Misato shouted at the only male in the apartment, making Shinji back away slightly.  
“什么！？”明日香和美里对着公寓里唯一的男性大喊，让真嗣不由得后退了一步。

"Ah..I think the problem is over now." Shinji told the girls while pointing to Aki. The two women saw that the little girl had now stopped running around endlessly and was wobbling where she stood.  
"啊...我想问题现在解决了。" 真嗣对女孩们说，同时指向了明。两位女士看到小女孩已经不再无休止地跑来跑去，而是摇摇晃晃地站在原地。

"Aww, now I'm sad..(yawn) and tired." came Aki's tired reply and went over to a still shell shocked and unresponsive PenPen and laid next to him by his fridge before leaning over the penguin, making both fall gently to the side and all three adults watched as Aki fell asleep while using PenPen's whole body as a personal pillow.  
"哎呀，现在我好难过...（打哈欠）还很累。" 明疲惫地回答，然后走向仍然处于震惊和无反应状态的 PenPen，躺在他旁边的冰箱旁，靠在企鹅身上，两人轻轻地侧倒在地。三个成年人看着明用 PenPen 的整个身体当枕头睡着了。

Watching this cute and funny display for a moment before all three once again looked at the destruction of the apartment.  
看着这可爱又滑稽的一幕，过了一会儿，三个人再次看向被毁坏的公寓。

"So… about that…" “那么…关于那个…”

### Chapter 8 Ode to Joy  
Chapter 8 欢乐颂

"And I got another gold star for making my own story. Oh and I also drew pictures for it to!" An excited Aki told her parents. She was holding both their hands as they walked back to the apartment, after they had picked her up from kindergarten.  
“我还因为自己编故事得了个小金星呢！哦，对了，我还给它画了插图！” 兴奋的 Aki 向她的父母讲述着。他们刚从幼儿园接她回来，正牵着她的手走回公寓。

"Das ist wunderbar, Schätzchen!" Asuka praised her daughter with a proud smile on the young mother's face. She was obviously happy that Aki was doing so well at kindergarten, something Shinji was also happy about, as well as relieved that Aki was adapting to her new surroundings.  
“真是太棒了，宝贝！”明日香自豪地笑着，夸奖她的女儿。显然，她很高兴阿基在幼儿园表现出色，这让真嗣也同样感到高兴，并松了一口气，因为阿基适应了新环境。

"Yeah, that's great honey. We're soo proud of you." Shinji added in his praise to his daughter. Aki looked extremely proud of herself from hearing both of her parents' praises, given the way she held her head high and a bright grin appearing on her face. Shinji couldn't help but chuckle slightly, Aki was definitely her mother's daughter.  
“是啊，太好了，亲爱的。我们为你感到非常骄傲。”真嗣也加入了对女儿的赞扬。听到父母双方的夸奖，阿基显得非常自豪，她高昂着头，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。真嗣忍不住轻声笑了起来，阿基无疑是她母亲的女儿。

"Well, since you've been such a good girl today, how about a trip to the playground and having ice cream too, ok?" Shinji said and as soon as the words 'playground' and especially 'ice cream' left his mouth, Aki stopped walking. Her smile widened and her eyes sparkled before she squealed loudly and all but launched and attached herself to his leg in a vice grip.  
“嗯，既然你今天表现得这么乖，那我们去游乐场，再吃冰淇淋怎么样？”真嗣提议道。话音刚落，尤其是‘冰淇淋’这个词一出，阿基就停下了脚步。她的笑容更灿烂了，眼睛闪闪发光，随即大声尖叫起来，几乎像弹射一样紧紧抱住了他的腿。

"YAY! Thank you Papa!" Aki beamed up at him. "Can I have a big cone? Oh and a double cone with strawberry sauce and lots and lots of sprinkles too?" Aki asked rapidly, even giving her Papa a puppy-eyed look in hopes to get a bit extra for her ice cream treat.  
"耶！谢谢爸爸！" 阿基朝他灿烂地笑着。"我可以要一个大号的蛋筒吗？哦，还要一个双球的，加草莓酱和好多好多的彩糖针！" 阿基快速地问道，甚至用小狗般的眼神看着爸爸，希望能多要点冰淇淋。

Under that look from his little girl, Shinji couldn't help but cave in. "Ok, ok, you can have anything you want honey." Shinji said, sighing softly. Honestly, the things he would do to make her happy.  
在女儿这样的眼神下，真嗣忍不住妥协了。"好吧，好吧，宝贝，你可以要任何你想要的。" 真嗣轻叹一声说道。说实话，为了让她开心，他什么都愿意做。

"Yaaay! Ice cream, ice cream!" Aki chanted as she detached from her Papa's leg and walked a bit further ahead from her parents.  
"耶！冰淇淋，冰淇淋！" 阿基一边欢呼着，一边从爸爸的腿上松开，向前走了几步，离父母稍远一些。

Watching his daughter for a second before he turned to Asuka, having even physically felt her gaze on him. She had a look of disappointment while crossing her arms.  
在他转向明日香之前，先看了女儿一秒钟，甚至能感觉到她的目光落在他身上。她交叉双臂，脸上带着失望的表情。

"Honestly baka, you spoil her too much." the young redhead stated to her husband.  
“说真的，笨蛋，你太宠她了。”年轻的红发女子对她的丈夫说道。

Shinji sighed again as they both walked to catch up to the excited four year old. "I know, I know, but I just can't help it." Shinji tried to excuse himself.  
两人一起走向那个兴奋的四岁小孩时，真嗣再次叹了口气。“我知道，我知道，但我就是忍不住。”真嗣试图为自己辩解。

Yeah, he had to admit that as of late he was spoiling Aki with more toys and treats then ever before but as a proud and loving father, how could he not pamper his little girl? Besides, it wasn't like he was giving her everything she wanted without cause or reason. Aki doing good at Kindergarten and doing good things from time to time was enough for Shinji to treat her to a toy or a tasty treat.  
是啊，他不得不承认最近确实给 Aki 买了比以往更多的玩具和零食，但作为一个自豪又充满爱意的父亲，他怎能不宠溺自己的小公主呢？再说了，他也不是毫无缘由或理由地满足她的一切要求。Aki 在幼儿园表现良好，时不时做些好事，这足以让真嗣给她买个玩具或美味的小吃作为奖励。

Asuka couldn't keep the stern look at him any longer before she sighed as well. She gave her husband a small smile. "Seriously baka, weren't you supposed to be the typical cliché Japanese strict father? You spoil her so much that you leave no opportunity for me to do so." Asuka said as she pouted.  
明日香再也维持不住那严肃的表情，叹了口气，对丈夫微微一笑。“真是的，笨蛋，你不是应该做个典型的日本严父吗？你把她宠得太过，我都找不到机会宠她了。”明日香噘嘴说道。

Shinji couldn't help but laugh a bit as Asuka admitted that she too wished to spoil Aki like he did. "Well, I promise that next opportunity you get to spoil her, ok?" Shinji promised her.  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来，因为明日香承认她也想像他一样宠溺 Aki。“好吧，我保证下次让你有机会宠她，好吗？”真嗣向她承诺道。

"I'll hold you to that, baka." Asuka grinned at him and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before taking his hand in hers as they caught up with Aki.  
“我可记住你这话了，笨蛋。”明日香冲他咧嘴一笑，迅速在他脸颊上亲了一下，然后握住他的手，追上了绫波。

"Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, icy icy creamy creamy ICE CREAM!" an excited Aki now was singing out loud. A little too excited for Shinji's taste as Aki was becoming more vocally loud with each passing second and he saw with a glance that a few of the other people passing were giving them disapproving looks.  
“冰淇淋，冰淇淋，冰淇淋，冰冰的，奶油的，冰淇淋！”兴奋的绫波现在大声唱着。对真嗣来说，她有点过于兴奋了，随着每一秒过去，她的声音越来越大，他瞥了一眼，发现一些路人正向他们投来不满的目光。

"Aki, honey, not so loud ok?" Shinji chided her a little, though a part of him hated to do so given how happy she was.  
“绫波，亲爱的，别这么大声好吗？”真嗣稍微责备了她一下，尽管看到她这么开心，他心里有些不忍。

"Ok, Papa!" Aki said with a smile clearly not bothered or even caring of being told off for her loudness. '_Probably her mind is still on ice cream.'_ Shinji thought.  
“好的，爸爸！” 阿基笑着说，显然并不介意或根本不在乎因大声说话而被责备。‘可能她的心思还在冰淇淋上。’ 真嗣心想。

"You know if she eats now, she'll never have room for dinner." Asuka reminded Shinji.  
“你知道如果她现在吃的话，晚饭就吃不下了。” 明日香提醒真嗣。

"You sure about that?" Shinji questioned back. "I'm pretty sure that she'll still be hungry after." Shinji stated and it was true. As of late he had seen Aki eat more and more and a part of him was slightly worried that his little girl was becoming overweight.  
“你确定吗？” 真嗣反问道。“我很确定她吃完后还是会饿。” 真嗣陈述道，这是真的。最近他注意到阿基吃得越来越多，他心里有一部分开始担心女儿可能会变胖。

As if reading his mind, Asuka tightened her grip on his hand and was giving him a slight warning glare. "Baka, are you implying that my baby is getting fat!?"  
仿佛读懂了他的心思，明日香紧了紧握住他的手，投来一丝警告的目光。“笨蛋，你是在暗示我的宝宝变胖了吗？！”

"Wha..what, no, of course not!" Shinji managed quickly say. "I'm just saying that she's quickly burning off the calories playing and running around a lot." Shinji finished, hopefully that his explanation would save him from his wife's potential wrath.  
“什...什么，当然不是！”真嗣急忙解释道，“我只是说她在玩耍和四处奔跑中迅速消耗了卡路里。”真嗣说完，希望这个解释能让他免于妻子可能的怒火。

Fortunately it did, as he felt Asuka ease up on her vice grip on his hand. "Well good." Asuka said as she walked on and pulled Shinji along, almost making him trip himself before he finally got his footing.  
幸运的是，这番话奏效了，他感觉到明日香放松了对他的手劲。“那就好。”明日香说着继续前行，拉着真嗣差点让他绊倒，最后他终于稳住了脚步。

Having caught up to Aki, who thankfully didn't venture too far ahead and out of sight from them. The little girl's curiosity made her stop and look into the opening windows from passing stores, wanting to know what was inside.  
终于追上了阿基，幸好她没有走得太远，以至于从视线中消失。这个小女孩的好奇心让她停下来，透过经过的商店的窗户往里看，想知道里面有什么。

As the three continued on towards the nearby park, Shinji heard Aki humming a tune but as it continued he felt an odd familiarity to it. It hit him like a ton of bricks upon realising what it was, the 'Ode to Joy' and promptly stopped in his tracks. Asuka was confused on why Shinji stopped all of a sudden.  
当三人继续向附近的公园走去时，真嗣听到阿基哼着一首曲子，但随着曲子的继续，他感到一种奇怪的熟悉感。当他意识到这是什么时，就像被一吨砖头击中一样，那是《欢乐颂》，他立刻停下了脚步。明日香对真嗣突然停下来感到困惑。

"Hey, what's wrong?" a concerned Asuka asked her husband, especially when he had a look like he had seen a ghost.  
“嘿，怎么了？”明日香关切地问她的丈夫，尤其是当他看起来像见了鬼一样。

"It...it couldn't be...could it be possible?" Shinji mumbled to himself. His words confused Asuka even more, but before she could ask him for clarification, he called out to Aki.  
"这...这不可能...真的有可能吗？" 真嗣喃喃自语。他的话让明日香更加困惑，但还没等她开口询问，真嗣就向 Aki 喊道。

"Aki, come here please."  
"Aki，请过来一下。"

Aki stopped and turned back to her parents before obediently walking back to them and looking up at her father. "Yes, Papa?"  
Aki 停下脚步，回头看了看她的父母，然后顺从地走回他们身边，抬头看着她的父亲。"是的，爸爸？"

Shinji got down on to his knees to talk to Aki. "Honey...where did you learn that?"  
真嗣跪下来与明说话。“亲爱的...你从哪儿学来的？”

"Learn what, Papa?" a confused Aki asked, not understanding what her father was asking. Shinji realised that he would have to be more specific towards his daughter.  
“学什么，爸爸？”明困惑地问，不明白父亲在问什么。真嗣意识到他需要对女儿更具体一些。

"Learn that song you where humming a moment ago." Shinji clarified with him humming the same song to help Aki remember.  
“就是刚才你在哼的那首歌。”真嗣一边哼着同样的歌，一边澄清，帮助明回忆起来。

Hearing it Aki face brightened up. "Ooh yeah that one! I remember I heard it from someone a while back."  
听到这个，Aki 的脸色亮了起来。“哦，对，就是那个！我记得不久前从某个人那里听到的。”

At that answer, Shinji grabbed Aki's shoulders, making her jump slightly. "Who was it Aki, do you know who it was!?" Shinji asked a bit urgently. Needing to know the truth.  
听到这个回答，Shinji 抓住了 Aki 的肩膀，让她微微一跳。“是谁，Aki，你知道是谁吗？！”Shinji 有些急切地问道，迫切想要知道真相。

"It was…it was…I can't remember?" Aki said looking like she knew the answer before becoming very confused herself, looking at her Papa with a now sad face. "I'm sorry Papa, I don't remember who taught me that song."  
“是……是……我想不起来了？”Aki 说道，看起来她之前知道答案，但现在变得非常困惑，看着她的爸爸，脸上带着悲伤。“对不起，爸爸，我不记得是谁教我那首歌了。”

Now Shinji was very confused himself. He knew that his daughter had a very good memory even for someone her age, so the likelihood that she couldn't remember where or from who she heard that particular song was low.  
现在，真嗣自己也感到非常困惑。他知道女儿的记忆力非常好，即使在她这个年纪也是如此，所以她记不清是从哪里或从谁那里听到那首特定的歌的可能性很低。

"Papa?" Aki's voice broke him out of his thoughts. He saw Aki looking a bit guilty, making him believe that she maybe thought she disappointed him with not remembering. Without saying anything he just smiled at his daughter, letting go of her shoulders before ruffling her brown locks of hair for a moment, making her giggle as he stood up.  
“爸爸？” 阿基的声音打断了他的思绪。他看到阿基看起来有些内疚，这让他相信她可能以为自己因为记不清而让他失望了。他没有说什么，只是对着女儿微笑，松开她的肩膀，然后轻轻揉乱她棕色的头发，让她咯咯笑起来，他站起身来。

"It's ok honey. It's fine that you can't remember. It wasn't that important anyway. Now let's hurry to the park and get that ice cream," Shinji said as he held out his hand to Aki, which she quickly grabbed before the three continued walking towards their destination.  
“没关系，亲爱的。记不清也没关系。反正那也不重要。现在我们快去公园吃冰淇淋吧。” 真嗣说着伸出手，阿基迅速抓住，三人继续向目的地走去。

Still, despite the words he said to his daughter, Shinji's thoughts still continued on. Was it possible that it had been Kaworu after all? Had he really planned out everything that happened to them, from the time travel to Aki returning?  
尽管如此，尽管他对女儿说了那些话，真嗣的思绪依旧在继续。难道最终还是渚薰吗？他真的策划了所有发生在他们身上的事情，从时间旅行到 Aki 的归来？

Before Shinji could think of anything more he felt a hand on his shoulder, making him look back to see Asuka. Her warm comforting smile that she was giving him said everything and reminded him that in the end it didn't matter how or even why.  
在真嗣能想到更多之前，他感到一只手搭在了他的肩膀上，让他回头看到了明日香。她那温暖而安慰的微笑已经说明了一切，并提醒他，最终，如何或为何发生并不重要。

But still, Shinji couldn't help but think that Kaworu must have played a crucial hand in giving back his daughter to him and Asuka.  
但即便如此，真嗣还是忍不住认为，渚薰一定在将女儿归还给他和明日香的过程中扮演了关键角色。

'_Thank you, Kaworu, for everything. For being my friend, for telling me that you loved me, for giving me a second try to make things right and most of all thank you for bringing my daughter back to me_,' Shinji thought as he took his family to the park.  
'谢谢你，薰，感谢你的一切。感谢你成为我的朋友，告诉我你爱我，给我第二次机会去修正一切，最重要的是，感谢你把我的女儿带回我身边。' 真嗣想着，带着家人前往公园。

### Chapter 10 Laughter

As night finally set on Neo Tokyo 3, a loud squeal echoed throughout the Katsuragi apartment, one that came from an excited four year old girl.  
当夜幕终于降临新东京 3 区时，一阵响亮的尖叫声在葛城公寓内回荡，那是一个兴奋的四岁小女孩发出的声音。

"YAAY! Rei's staying over, Rei's staying over!" Aki exclaimed say as she continued to jump up and down repeatedly while running around the apartment in excitement that her friend was staying for the night.  
“耶！丽在留宿，丽在留宿！”阿基兴奋地喊着，一边不停地跳上跳下，一边在公寓里跑来跑去，因为她的朋友要留下来过夜。

"If it's too much of an inconvenience I could.." Rei tried to say but was promptly cut off.  
“如果这太麻烦的话，我可以……”丽试图说，但很快被打断了。

"Oh for the love of..Rei it's fine you can stay over, there's no trouble at all. Besides do you want to go and break her little heart by telling her that you won't be staying over now?" Asuka questioned as she gestured a look towards Aki and both girls saw that the little rascal, who still in her excitement of Rei staying was now chasing PenPen around the room in an attempt to hug the bird. "Plus you're definitely not going to be walking all the way home in that." Asuka finished saying as she gestured at the apartment balcony windows and seeing the storm outside raging on.  
"哦，看在上帝的份上...丽，没关系，你可以留宿，一点麻烦都没有。再说了，你难道忍心告诉她，你现在不留下过夜，让她那颗小心灵破碎吗？" 明日香一边说，一边向爱希示意，两个女孩看到那个小淘气，因为丽留宿而兴奋不已，现在正满屋子追着企鹅 PenPen，试图抱住它。"而且，你肯定不会想在这样的天气里走回家的。" 明日香说完，指了指公寓阳台的窗户，外面正狂风暴雨。

Just as Aki was in grasp reach of catching the runaway penguin, a loud sound of thunder was heard, startling Aki enough to make her jump in fright and stop her pursuit of the bird who took the opportunity to retreat back into the safety of his fridge. Hearing another sound of thunder Aki went up to the balcony window, looking out in the night and occasionally seeing more lightening strikes and waiting for the thunder after them.  
就在爱希即将抓住那只逃跑的企鹅时，一声响雷突然响起，吓得爱希惊跳起来，停止了追逐，企鹅趁机退回到冰箱的安全地带。听到又一声雷响，爱希走到阳台窗前，望着夜空，不时看到闪电划过，等待着随之而来的雷声。

The storm in question had literally came out of nowhere and was the main reason why Rei was now staying over. Originally the blue haired teen was more than willing to wait till the storm settled but after many hours having passed the storm not only hadn't settle down but had gotten worse to the point that the news on the tv had just issued a weather warning to the people of Tokyo 3 to stay indoors and that all train transports were to be halted.  
这场突如其来的风暴实际上是从天而降的，也是丽现在留宿的主要原因。原本蓝发少女非常愿意等到风暴平息，但随着时间的流逝，风暴不仅没有减弱，反而愈演愈烈，以至于电视新闻刚刚向第三东京市的居民发布了天气预警，要求大家待在室内，所有火车交通都已暂停。

At that Shinji and Asuka had then decided to offer Rei to stay for the night and the blue haired teen finally accepted, though only after Aki had used her ultimate weapon, her puppy dog pout look while she begged Rei to stay.  
于是，真嗣和明日香决定邀请丽留宿一晚，蓝发少女最终接受了邀请，不过是在阿基使用了她的终极武器——小狗般可怜兮兮的眼神，恳求丽留下之后。

Asuka chuckled at remembering that. Even the stoic Rei looked helpless against Aki when she brought out the big guns, something Asuka silently admitted that she had taught Aki. Mostly to let her daughter get her way over her husband but it eventually became a problem for herself when Aki started using it on her and Asuka cursed to herself on her plan backfiring on her.  
明日香想起那一幕不禁轻笑。即便是冷静的丽，在阿基使出杀手锏时也显得无可奈何，明日香暗自承认这是她教给女儿的。起初是为了让女儿在她父亲面前得逞，但当阿基开始对她使用这一招时，明日香暗自咒骂自己的计划适得其反。

As Asuka sighed while smiling weary at the memory, Shinji had finished talking to whoever was on the phone.  
当明日香带着疲惫的微笑回忆往事时，真嗣已经结束了与电话那头的人的交谈。

"Hey, I just finished talking to Misato. Looks like she's staying at NERV HQ tonight due to both her workload and the storm." Shinji told everyone. "I also told her that Rei was staying over and she said it's fine..though she did say, and I quote; 'make sure the little terror doesn't get to excited and trash the apartment again'." Shinji finished saying.  
“嘿，我刚和美里通完电话。看来她今晚因为工作量和暴风雨要留在 NERV 总部了。”真嗣告诉大家。“我还告诉她绫波要留宿，她说没问题……不过她确实说了，我引用一下；‘确保那个小魔头别太兴奋，再把公寓搞得一团糟。’”真嗣说完。

"Geez she's really never going to let that one go, is she? Besides that whole incident started mostly because of her anyway." Asuka stated while slightly defending her daughter, remembering when the apartment was trashed by Aki due to the little one being on an extreme high sugar rush by one of Misato's energy drinks she had left lying around her messy room.  
“天哪，她真是永远不会忘记那件事，对吧？再说那次事件主要也是因为她。”明日香略带辩护地说起她的女儿，回想起公寓被小爱搞得一团糟的那次，是因为小家伙喝了美里留在她凌乱房间里的一瓶能量饮料，导致极度高糖分发作。

It had taken nearly a whole week to fix the apartment after that and a new absolute rule that was established was that Aki was never to drink anything with too much sugar and that caffeine drinks were completely out of the question also.  
那次之后，修好公寓几乎花了整整一周时间，同时确立了一条绝对规则：Aki 绝不能再喝含糖量过高的饮料，咖啡因饮料更是完全禁止。

"Rei!" Aki's short cry got everyone's attention before the child latched onto the leg of the blue haired teen. "This is gonna be totally wicked! We can stay up late, tell many many bedtime stories and in the morning, Papa!" Aki exclaimed as she let go of Rei and turned towards her father.  
"丽！" Aki 短促的呼喊吸引了所有人的注意，随即孩子紧紧抱住了蓝发少年的腿。"这一定会超级棒的！我们可以熬夜，讲好多好多睡前故事，早上，爸爸！" Aki 松开丽，转向她的父亲兴奋地说道。

"Er..yes honey?" Shinji asked a bit confused on why she suddenly called attention to him.  
"呃...是的，宝贝？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道，不明白她为何突然把注意力转向他。

"You're making waffles," Aki stated while having an all too familiar grin that reminded Shinji of Asuka.  
"你在做华夫饼，" 阿基说道，脸上带着一个太过熟悉的笑容，让真嗣想起了明日香。

"First of all, kleines Fräulein, you're not staying up late. Next, you will have one bedtime story and lastly yes, Papa will be make waffles or else!" Asuka said while she gave Shinji a smirk and a wink on with the last part. "And speaking of bedtime, it's about time you started getting ready, Schätzchen."  
"首先，小女士，你不会熬夜的。其次，你只能听一个睡前故事，最后，是的，爸爸会做华夫饼，否则！" 明日香说着，对真嗣露出一个得意的笑容并眨了眨眼。"说到睡觉，你也该开始准备睡觉了，宝贝。"

Aki pouted, clearly wanting to stay up a bit more. "Oh, but Mama, I want to play with Rei more..and I'm not even tired yet." the little girl complained.  
阿基噘着嘴，显然还想再玩一会儿。"哦，但是妈妈，我还想和丽多玩一会儿……而且我还不困呢。"小女孩抱怨道。

"Well, if you're not tired yet then I guess me and Mama will make you tired then." Shinji told as Aki saw a smirk on her Papa's face while also seeing his fingers wiggling as he approached her.  
"好吧，如果你还不累的话，那我和妈妈就让你累吧。" 真嗣说道，同时明看到爸爸脸上露出一丝坏笑，手指还一边扭动着向她靠近。

Knowing what he was planning to do, Aki ran, giggling and laughing as Shinji was chasing her around the apartment while Asuka smiled as she looked on along with a confused Rei. Turning towards her former blue haired pilot before passing her some clothes. "Here Rei, I got some nightclothes for you to wear."  
知道他要做什么，明笑着跑开了，真嗣在公寓里追着她，而明日香微笑着在一旁看着，还有一脸困惑的丽。她转向曾经的蓝发飞行员，递给她一些衣服。"这是给你的睡衣，丽。"

"Thank you." Rei gave her thanks before wordlessly walking to the bathroom to change.  
"谢谢你。" 丽道谢后，默默地走进浴室去换衣服。

Just as Asuka watched Rei go into the bathroom she turned back to see that Shinji had finally managed to catch the runaway girl and began tickling her relentlessly, making Aki squeal and laugh like crazy as it went on while also falling on the floor.  
正当明日香看着绫波走进浴室时，她转过身来，看到真嗣终于抓住了逃跑的女孩，开始无情地挠她痒痒，让秋不停地尖叫和大笑，同时也跌倒在地上。

"Haha..haha! Papa, stop! Stop! I give! I give! Haha!" Aki squealed out giving the signal to surrender.  
“哈哈...哈哈！爸爸，停下！停下！我投降！我投降！哈哈！”秋尖叫着发出了投降的信号。

"Ha..ha..so..you're finally..tired and ready..for bed…sweetie?" Shinji said while gasping for air. Clearly the chase wore and tired him out more than Aki.  
“哈...哈...所以...你终于...累了，准备好...睡觉了...宝贝？”真嗣喘着气说。显然，这场追逐让他比秋更疲惫。

However the cheeky smirk Aki gave him said otherwise and seeing an opening Aki quickly got up again and ran away from her father's grasp. "Nope, not tired yet!"  
然而，Aki 那调皮的微笑却传达了不同的信息，看到机会，Aki 迅速再次起身，逃离了父亲的掌控。“不，还没累呢！”

Shinji sighed heavily before restarting the chase again though this time Shinji was unable to catch his energetic little girl and after a few minutes ended up gasping heavy as he collapsed down on the floor. Regaining enough of his senses, he looked up to see Asuka giving him a slight look of disappointment.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，再次开始追逐，但这次他没能抓住精力充沛的小女儿，几分钟后，他气喘吁吁地瘫倒在地上。恢复了一些神智后，他抬头看到明日香给了他一个略带失望的眼神。

"Um..hey Asuka..ha..tag in?" Shinji weakly asked, still somewhat winded and now extremely tired. His request made Asuka sigh.  
“呃...嘿，明日香...哈...换人？”真嗣虚弱地问道，仍然有些喘不过气，现在更是疲惫不堪。他的请求让明日香叹了口气。

"Honestly Shinji, what good is all that exercise you been doing lately if you get this tired from a simple game of chase." Asuka complained and mocked her husband while nudging him with her foot.  
“说真的，真嗣，你最近那么拼命锻炼，结果一个简单的追逐游戏就把你累成这样，有什么用啊？”明日香一边抱怨一边用脚轻轻推了推她的丈夫，语气中带着调侃。

Not receiving a response other then a now slight snoring. Asuka blinked for a second in surprise before rolling her eyes at her now sleeping husband, though to be fair both of them have been more tired today then any other. The fact that Aki had woken them both much earlier in then morning than normal and adding in the activities of travelling to the shops, the playground while walking and running around all day, it wasn't a surprise that the two teenage parents were tired.  
没有得到回应，只听到轻微的鼾声。明日香愣了一秒，随即对已经睡着的丈夫翻了个白眼，不过话说回来，今天他们俩确实比平时更累。毕竟阿基比平时早得多就把他们俩吵醒了，再加上去商店、游乐场，一整天都在走来跑去，这对年轻的父母感到疲惫也不足为奇。

Despite her own tiredness, Asuka intended to finish what Shinji had started and set to catch Aki, who came back into the living room after now noticing her Papa wasn't trying to tickle catch her.  
尽管自己也感到疲惫，明日香还是决定完成真嗣未竟的任务，开始捕捉阿基，小家伙此时回到了客厅，发现爸爸已经不再追着她玩挠痒痒了。

"Is Papa really sleeping Mama?" Aki asked her mother a bit surprised that her Papa was down for the count while also making sure that this wasn't a trap set by him to make her drop her guard.  
“爸爸真的在睡觉吗，妈妈？” 阿基问她的母亲，有点惊讶于她的爸爸居然已经睡着了，同时也确保这不是他设下的陷阱，让她放松警惕。

"Yep, he's sleeping like a little baby, Schätzchen," Asuka said with Aki giggling at her sleeping father. "You tired him out more than he did you. Which means I have to finish job." Asuka announced with a playful tone as she turned fully to her daughter with her hands ready. Aki, seeing this, was already backing away.  
“是的，他睡得像个婴儿，宝贝，” 明日香说着，阿基看着熟睡的父亲咯咯笑。“你比他更累坏了他。这意味着我得完成这项工作。” 明日香带着俏皮的语气宣布，完全转向她的女儿，双手准备就绪。阿基见状，已经开始后退。

"No..no..NOOO!" Aki screamed and laughed as Asuka continued the chase. Being more athletic than Shinji, Asuka was able to catch her little one after a quick run around the apartment and began tickle torture her baby.  
“不…不…不要！” 阿基尖叫着笑了起来，明日香继续追逐。比真嗣更灵活的明日香，在公寓里快速跑了一圈后，很快就抓住了她的小宝贝，开始对她进行挠痒痒的折磨。

"HAHA! MAMA STOP STOP! HAHAHA" Aki squealing and laughing.

"Oh so are you finally going to surrender and go to bed now, Schätzchen?" Asuka asked Aki as she paused her tickle assault.  
"哦，你终于要投降去睡觉了吗，宝贝？" 明日香在暂停挠痒攻击时问阿基。

Unfortunately Aki broke free from her mother's grasp and ran again. "No surrender!"  
不幸的是，阿基挣脱了母亲的怀抱，再次跑开。"绝不投降！"

Asuka sighed but felt a small amount of pride of Aki saying that before getting to her feet and resuming the chase. Hopefully she would eventually tire out her Aki after a few minutes before she, Shinji and their guest could hit the hay.  
明日香叹了口气，但心中为阿基说出那句话而感到一丝骄傲，她站起身来继续追逐。希望几分钟后她能让阿基累倒，然后她和真嗣以及他们的客人就能上床休息了。

x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x

"Mama, Mama, are we still playing?" Aki asked her now sleeping mother who was now lying next to her still sleeping Papa on the living room floor.  
"妈妈，妈妈，我们还在玩吗？" 阿基问她现在正躺在客厅地板上，旁边是她仍在熟睡的爸爸的母亲。

Rei had watched the whole thing play out while she sat on the couch. After changing into the nightwear provided, Rei had seen that Soryu had resumed the chase which Ikari had started but it seemed the young mother had underestimated Aki's youthful stamina. A chase which should have been a few minutes turned into thirty minutes. Asuka had caught Aki dozens of times but Aki still refused to tire out. It got to the point that even Asuka herself collapsed and dozed off to to being knackered from chasing her hyperactive four year old.  
丽坐在沙发上目睹了整个过程。换上提供的睡衣后，丽看到索鲁已经重新开始了一诚发起的追逐，但这位年轻的母亲似乎低估了阿基的青春活力。本应持续几分钟的追逐变成了三十分钟。明日香抓住了阿基几十次，但阿基仍然拒绝疲惫。最终，甚至连明日香自己都因追逐她那精力旺盛的四岁孩子而筋疲力尽，倒下睡着了。

"Are they really sleeping Rei?" Aki honesty asked her friend. Not sure if this was still a new tactic to jump her when she wasn't prepared.  
"他们真的睡着了吗，丽？" 阿基真诚地问她的朋友。不确定这是否仍是一种新的策略，趁她不备时跳起来。

Rei nodded to her. "Yes, both of them were already tired from before, so it's no surprise that they are sleeping now."  
丽点点头回应她。“是的，他们之前就已经很累了，所以现在睡着了并不奇怪。”

"Oh ok..well their plan backfired as I'm not sleepy at all." Aki proudly stated, feeling like she had won over her parents at this. "So let's play, Rei!"  
“哦，好吧……他们的计划适得其反了，因为我现在一点也不困。”阿基自豪地说道，感觉在这件事上赢过了父母。“那我们来玩吧，丽！”

Knowing that her little friend wouldn't take no for an answer, she simply agreed with a nod. "Very well. What do you want us to do?"  
知道她的小朋友不会接受否定的答案，她只是点头同意。“很好。你想让我们做什么？”

Aki had a thoughtful look for a moment before perking up, clearly she had something in mind. "Let me tickle chase you!"  
Aki 沉思了一会儿，随即眼睛一亮，显然她想到了什么。“让我来追你吧！”

Rei was baffled for a second, clearly she had thought that Aki would choose another game to play. "You wish to continue playing what your parents had started?"  
Rei 愣了一下，显然她以为 Aki 会选择另一个游戏。“你想继续玩你父母开始的游戏吗？”

"Yep! But this time I'm the one going to be chasing you. So get ready Rei!" Aki said and for some reason Rei Ayanami felt a sense of dread, especially when Aki grinned as she slowly advanced towards her with her hands ready.  
“是的！但这次轮到我来追你了。所以准备好吧，Rei！”Aki 说道，不知为何，Rei Ayanami 感到一阵不安，尤其是当 Aki 笑着慢慢向她逼近，双手准备就绪时。

x-x-x-x-x

Shinji was have a very pleasant dream of Asuka in a playboy bunny suit before he felt being roughly shaken repeatedly.  
真嗣正做着一个非常愉快的梦，梦见明日香穿着兔女郎装，直到他感觉到被人粗暴地摇晃着。

"Baka, get your ass up already. You need to see this." Shinji heard Asuka's voice.  
“笨蛋，快起来。你得看看这个。”真嗣听到了明日香的声音。

"Wha..what is it?" Shinji asked groggily, before he was yanked up by his shirt by his wife and was forcibly dragged unsteadily to his feet and moving along with her rushed movements, nearly tripping up a few times before they both stood at the entrance to Aki's room.  
“什……什么啊？”真嗣迷迷糊糊地问道，随即被妻子拽着衬衫拉了起来，踉踉跄跄地被拖着走，差点摔倒几次，最后两人站在了 Aki 的房间门口。

It took Shinji a moment realise what Asuka wanted to show him upon both seeing and even hearing it himself. In their past life, he had seen Rei smile only a total of three times. One being directed towards his father during a synch test, the next one when he himself had told Rei herself to smile after their battle with the fifth angel and the third was during Instrumentality.  
真嗣愣了一会儿才明白明日香想让他看的是什么，即便他自己亲眼所见、亲耳所闻。在前世，他只见过绫波笑过三次。一次是在同步测试中对着他的父亲，另一次是在与第五使徒战斗后他告诉绫波自己要她微笑，第三次则是在人类补完计划期间。

What Shinji and Asuka were seeing now in front of them was Rei not only genuinely smiling but she was laughing too. Granted it was soft laughing but Rei was actually laughing and from Aki tickling her. From her underarms to her bare feet which seemed to be the main reason for Rei laughing.  
现在，真嗣和明日香眼前所见的是绫波不仅在真诚地微笑，而且还在笑出声。虽然笑声很轻，但绫波确实在笑，而且是因为秋在逗她。从她的腋下到赤裸的脚丫，似乎是绫波大笑的主要原因。

"Well I'll be, would you look at that." Shinji said, amazed at what he was witnessing, sharing a look with Asuka who he knew was likewise amazed at the scene before them. Shinji had always wished for Rei to have more in her life, a bit of happiness rather then being a tool for his father's plans. Now thanks to his daughter Aki, Rei surely was getting that happiness she rightfully deserved.  
“真是没想到，你看看那。”真嗣说道，对眼前的一幕感到惊讶，他与明日香交换了一个眼神，知道她同样对眼前的情景感到惊讶。真嗣一直希望绫波能拥有更多的生活，一点幸福而不是仅仅作为他父亲计划的工具。现在多亏了他的女儿秋，绫波无疑正在得到她应得的那份幸福。

### Chapter 11 Swim Like You Want To Swim

"Wow! This is very wicked! The swimming pool is so huge!" shouted an excited Aki.  
“哇！这太棒了！游泳池好大啊！”兴奋的 Aki 大声喊道。

"Err yeah, it's very big honey." Shinji said though not with the same enthusiasm as his daughter. Giving the NERV swimming pool a concerned look and a glance at Asuka, who shared his concerns.  
“呃，是啊，很大，亲爱的。”Shinji 说道，虽然他的热情不及女儿。他担忧地看了一眼 NERV 的游泳池，又瞥了一眼同样面露忧色的 Asuka。

"Maybe this isn't the best idea after all." Asuka voiced out to everyone present, which consisted of her, Shinji, Aki, Rei and surprisingly PenPen, who Misato had asked to bring along for some reason. "I mean look at it. This pool is for swimming athletes, clearly not suitable for children, especially not for Aki's age. Even in the shallow end is still a bit too high for her." Asuka finished saying, already considering this to be a wasted journey.  
“也许这终究不是个好主意。”Asuka 向在场的每个人表达了自己的看法，包括她、Shinji、Aki、Rei，还有出乎意料的 PenPen，Misato 不知为何让他也跟来了。“我是说，看看这池子。这是给游泳运动员用的，显然不适合小孩子，尤其是 Aki 这个年纪的。即使在浅水区，对她来说也还是有点太高了。”Asuka 说完，已经开始觉得这次出行是白费功夫了。

Aki however disagreed as her face started to pout. "Oooh, but Mama I want to finally learn how to swim!" The girl complained to her overprotective mother.  
然而，阿基却不同意，她的脸开始撅起嘴来。“哦，但是妈妈，我终于想学会游泳了！”女孩向她过度保护的母亲抱怨道。

Both Asuka and Shinji sighed in sync. This had been a problem for about a week. Finding out that nearly all of her kindergarten friends already knew how to swim without the aid of floaty arm rings had struck a nerve with the little girl and Aki had all but demanded that her parents finally teach her how to swim.  
明日香和真嗣同时叹了口气。这个问题已经持续了一周。发现几乎所有幼儿园的朋友都已经知道如何在不用浮臂圈的情况下游泳，这让小女孩感到不安，阿基几乎要求父母终于教她游泳。

At first, it was adorable, especially to Shinji that Aki indeed was her mother's daughter and had that famous Soryu pride within her and that she not only wanted to be able to swim but also show off that she was the best at it. It went as far as Aki, who was infamously known not to like her bath times, willingly going into them. Her goal at that was simply to practice how long she could hold her breath underwater since her classmate Ririko had boasted that her record was twenty seconds. Heck, Aki also had attempted to practice paddling in it though the result was that she didn't have any room to move and splashed a lot of water around the bathroom, making a watery mess which she was slightly scolded for.  
起初，这很可爱，尤其是对真嗣来说，阿基确实是她母亲的女儿，有着著名的惣流骄傲，她不仅想学会游泳，还想炫耀自己是最好的。阿基甚至自愿洗澡，这是众所周知的她不喜欢的事情。她的目标只是练习能在水下憋气多久，因为她的同学莉里子曾吹嘘她的记录是二十秒。见鬼，阿基还试图在浴缸里练习划水，尽管结果是她没有足够的空间移动，溅得到处都是水，弄得浴室一团糟，因此她稍微被责备了一下。

So when that didn't work, Aki wanted to go to the family's usual spot by the lake outside Tokyo-3 where the family went fishing and enjoy swimming. And going there had been the original plan, however, it had turned out that there was a problem. Shinji and Asuka found out recently that the lake was owned by the local area and thus fishing and even swimming were prohibited much to the dismay of the family. Shinji had brought up the idea of maybe using their high school swimming pool but that was shot down quickly as bringing Aki there would create problems for their family situation.  
因此，当这一计划行不通时，Aki 提议去东京-3 郊外湖边家族常去的垂钓地点享受游泳。原本计划如此，然而却出现了问题。最近，真嗣和明日香发现该湖属于当地管辖，因此钓鱼甚至游泳都被禁止，这让全家大失所望。真嗣曾提出或许可以使用高中游泳池，但这一提议很快被否决，因为带 Aki 去那里会给家庭状况带来麻烦。

Fortune smiled upon Aki as her friend Rei, after becoming aware of the situation, had reminded them that NERV had their private pool, making the two parents mentally facepalm themselves for not remembering something like that.  
幸运之神眷顾了 Aki，她的朋友绫波在了解到情况后提醒他们，NERV 有自己的私人泳池，这让两位家长不禁在心里自责怎么忘了这回事。

So now that the group were there, Asuka and Shinji's parental instincts kicked in upon seeing the pool and the potential dangers towards Aki. But seeing that the little girl wasn't taking no for an answer, they had to accept the situation.  
现在，一行人已经到达泳池边，看到泳池及对 Aki 可能存在的危险，真嗣和明日香的父母本能立刻被激发。但看到小女孩坚决不接受否定的回答，他们只得接受现状。

Aki being overjoyed looked like she was going to jump straight in despite not having changed into her swimwear prompting Shinji to hastily grab her, making her shriek in surprise as she was quickly cooped up from behind by him.  
阿基欣喜若狂的样子，似乎要直接跳进水里，尽管她还没换上泳装，这让真嗣急忙抓住她，让她惊叫起来，被他从背后迅速抱住。

"No Aki, not yet." Shinji told his impatient daughter sternly and quickly while backing away and gently putting her down, well away from the swimming pool's edge.  
“不行，阿基，还不能去。”真嗣严厉而迅速地告诉急不可耐的女儿，同时后退并轻轻把她放下，远离游泳池边缘。

Aki pouted, obviously upset about being kept from going into the pool. "Oooh, but why, Papa?"  
阿基噘起嘴，显然对不能下水感到不高兴。“哦，可是为什么呀，爸爸？”

"You can't go in yet because you haven't changed yet. Also, you need to wait for one of us to be with you in the pool at all times too." Shinji stated as fact.  
"你还不能进去，因为你还没换衣服。而且，你还需要等我们中的一个人一直陪你在泳池里。" 真嗣以事实陈述的口吻说道。

"But PenPen is going in all by himself right now." Aki tried to argue while pointing to the penguin, which everyone in the room turned their eyes towards to and saw that PenPen was already on the diving board on the other side and started doing a few bouncing hops on the board before making a graceful dive into the pool. Well, as graceful as a warm water penguin could be.  
"但 PenPen 现在正自己进去呢。" 阿基试图争辩，同时指向那只企鹅，房间里的每个人都转头看向它，只见 PenPen 已经站在另一边的跳水板上，开始在板上做了几个弹跳动作，然后优雅地跳入池中。好吧，对于一只温水企鹅来说，已经算是相当优雅了。

Wanting to talk about the elephant (or more accurately, the penguin) in the room Shinji turned towards the older two girls for an answer.  
想要讨论房间里的大象（或者更确切地说，是企鹅），真嗣转向两位年长的女孩寻求答案。

"Um, does anyone know the reason why Misato asked us to bring him along with us again?" he asked, honestly wondering why their former guardian had asked them to bring the bird along, as well as being very confused on why PenPen came along willingly. It wasn't a big secret that PenPen was utterly terrified of the little girl. At best he would simply tolerate Aki's presence when necessary. So his willingness to come along with them was a bit of a surprise.  
"呃，有人知道为什么美里又要我们带他一起来吗？" 他问道，真心想知道他们以前的监护人为什么要他们带上这只鸟，同时也非常困惑为什么 PenPen 会自愿跟来。众所周知，PenPen 对那个小女孩完全感到害怕。充其量，他只是在必要时勉强忍受亚纪的存在。所以，他愿意和他们一起来有点出乎意料。

"Who knows? Misato probably bribed him with some expensive beer to help get along and play nice with Aki." Asuka figured, but was already dismissive of this conversation regarding the flightless bird and focused on her daughter.  
"谁知道呢？美里可能是用一些昂贵的啤酒贿赂了他，让他和亚纪好好相处。" 明日香猜测道，但对这只不会飞的鸟的对话已经不感兴趣，转而关注她的女儿。

"Ok, Schätzchen are you sure you're ok with being here?" Asuka asked as she kneeled to Aki's level.  
"好吧，宝贝，你确定你在这里没问题吗？" 明日香蹲下来问亚纪。

Aki nodded. 阿基点了点头。

"You sure it's not too deep or scary for you?" Asuka continued.  
“你确定这对你来说不会太深奥或恐怖吗？”明日香继续问道。

Aki nodded again but her brows indicated that she was slowly getting irritated.  
阿基再次点头，但她的眉头显示出她正慢慢变得不耐烦。

"You sure you don't want the rubber rings to start with first?" Shinji asked, adding his concerns. The mention of those dreaded things made Aki even madder and she gave her Papa a glare which he knew answered his question.  
"你确定不想先从橡胶圈开始吗？" 真嗣问道，表达了他的担忧。提到那些令人讨厌的东西让亚纪更加生气，她向爸爸投去一个眼神，他明白这已经回答了他的问题。

"Ok..oh, do you want to use the bathroom before you go in?" Shinji asked yet another question.  
"好的...哦，你想在进去之前用一下洗手间吗？" 真嗣又问了一个问题。

"Nooo!" Aki angrily shouted.

"You sure you don't need to use the bathroom, Schätzchen?" Asuka asked, wanting to make properly sure that Aki went before jumping into the pool.  
"你确定不需要用洗手间吗，小宝贝？" 明日香问道，想要确保亚纪在跳进泳池前去过了。

"Nooooo! I don't need to use the bathroom! I don't want to wear those stupid floaty things! I want to swim ON MY OWN!" Aki angry shrieked out while also stomping her foot on the tile floor she had enough of her parent's overbearing protectiveness.  
“不！我不需要去洗手间！我不想穿那些愚蠢的漂浮物！我要自己游泳！” 阿基愤怒地尖叫着，同时跺着脚在瓷砖地板上，她受够了父母过度的保护。

For Asuka and Shinji, it has been quite a while since their daughter was had been seriously angry with both of them. Asuka and Shinji nodded to each other, already agreeing to push their worries about this and get on with the lessons. Asuka let out a sigh before reaching out her hand to Aki. "Ok Schätzchen, let's go in, shall we?"  
对于明日香和真嗣来说，已经很久没有看到女儿对他们如此生气了。明日香和真嗣互相点头，已经同意放下担忧，继续进行课程。明日香叹了口气，然后伸出手向阿基。“好吧，小宝贝，我们进去吧，好吗？”

Aki, still somewhat angry, looked at her mother's stretched hand and looked like she was about to take it for a moment before she quickly retracted it, surprising Asuka.  
阿基仍然有些生气，看着母亲伸出的手，似乎要接受一会儿，然后迅速收回，这让明日香感到惊讶。

"I want Rei to teach me." Aki stated firmly while looking down at her feet not looking at her parents.  
“我想让丽教我。” 阿基坚定地说，目光低垂，没有看向她的父母。

'_Ouch_' both Asuka and Shinji thought in sync. It had hurt their feelings that Aki didn't want either of them to participate in this with her. They knew that they were being a bit overbearing, but they honestly couldn't help it.  
“哎哟” 明日香和真嗣同步地想。阿基不想让他们中的任何一个参与这件事，这让他们感到受伤。他们知道自己有点过分，但真的无法控制。

Asuka tried to say something to make Aki reconsider, but couldn't find any sort of words to say. She gave Shinji a quick look, hoping that he could say something to change the situation, but saw that he was in the same position as her. With a pained look, Asuka still smiled at Aki even though it was forced. "Ok Schätzchen, if that's what you want then Rei will teach you. I and Papa will be right here if you need us..ok?"  
明日香试图说些什么让阿基重新考虑，但找不到任何合适的词。她迅速看了真嗣一眼，希望他能说些什么改变局面，却发现他和自己一样无言以对。明日香带着痛苦的表情，尽管勉强，仍对阿基微笑道：“好吧，小宝贝，如果你真这么想，那就让丽教你。我和爸爸会一直在这里，如果你需要我们的话……好吗？”

Aki slowly nodded. Her decision had made her Mama and Papa sad but she was stubbornly refusing to back down from this. She wanted to swim like everyone else and her parents were just annoying and getting in the way of that.  
阿基缓缓点头。她的决定让妈妈和爸爸感到难过，但她固执地拒绝退缩。她想像其他人一样游泳，而她的父母只是令人讨厌，妨碍了她。

Aki turned and walked slowly away to the direction of the changing room, Rei who had been quiet throughout the exchange proceeded to follow her little friend.  
阿基转身，慢慢地朝更衣室的方向走去，在整个对话中一直保持沉默的丽紧随她的小朋友。

"Ayanami...Rei, wait." Shinji called out making Rei pause and turn her head to the side showing she was listening to him.  
“绫波...丽，等等。”真嗣喊道，这让丽停下脚步，侧过头来表示她在听他说话。

"Look after Aki and keep her safe for us..please." Shinji pleaded to the blued-haired teen as he took a quick look at Asuka as she quickly walked past Rei and into the changing room after Aki.  
“照顾好 Aki，确保她的安全，拜托了。”真嗣向那位蓝发少年恳求道，同时迅速瞥了一眼明日香，只见她快步走过绫波，走进了更衣室，紧随 Aki 之后。

"There is no need to worry." Rei said softly as she glanced in the direction where Aki was. "She won't drown nor will any harm come to her, because I'll protect her." Rei finished saying with such determination and certainty while she resumed following her friend.  
“无需担心。”绫波轻声说道，目光投向 Aki 所在的方向。“她既不会溺水，也不会受到任何伤害，因为我将保护她。”绫波以坚定不移的语气说完，继续跟随她的朋友。

At that moment Shinji remembered his third Angel battle with Ramiel and Operation Yashima, clearly remembering that day when Rei made a similar promise to him.  
那一刻，真嗣想起了他与雷米尔的第三次天使战斗以及耶希玛行动，清晰地记得那天绫波曾向他许下类似的承诺。

"_You won't die, because I'll protect you."_  
"你不会死的，因为我会保护你。"

Back then, he felt so reassured by her words that it had helped calm him during the battle. Even more so that Rei had put herself in direct line of the angel's blast to protect him regardless of her well-being.  
那时，她的这番话让他感到如此安心，以至于在战斗中帮助他平静下来。更让他感动的是，尽管自己安危不顾，丽还是直接站在了天使的攻击路线上保护他。

So hearing those similar words from her, Shinji knew that Rei would do anything in her power to keep that promise and look after Aki, knowing for sure that she was in safe hands.  
因此，当再次听到她类似的承诺时，真嗣知道丽会尽其所能去履行那个诺言，照顾好明，他确信她会得到妥善的保护。

After a few short minutes of changing into their swimwear, Shinji came out first, wearing some new purple swim trunks. While he was waiting for the girls proceeded to blow up a few inflatables for the pool that he bought on the way. Just as he was blowing up a lilo bed, the girls finally come out. Aki in her red kiddie swimsuit, Asuka in her red and white two-piece swimsuit (something which Shinji was once again thankful to see again), but the surprise (or lack of it) was that Rei was just wearing her standard school swimsuit.  
几分钟后，换上泳装的真嗣率先走了出来，穿着一条新的紫色泳裤。他一边等待女孩们，一边开始给路上买的几个充气泳池玩具充气。正当他给一个充气床垫吹气时，女孩们终于出来了。绫穿着她的红色儿童泳装，明日香则穿着红白相间的两件式泳装（真嗣再次为此感到庆幸），而令人意外（或并不意外）的是，丽只是穿着她平常的学校泳装。

He wasn't the only one who was surprised as Asuka gave Rei a dull look.  
感到惊讶的不止他一个，明日香对丽投以了无趣的目光。

"We need to get you some new swimwear Rei." Asuka said, making a mental note to remember to go clothes shopping with the blue-haired teen.  
“我们需要给你买些新的泳装，丽。”明日香说道，心里记下了要带蓝发少女去购物的念头。

"It's suffi.." Rei began to say.  
"这已经足够……" 丽开始说道。

"Rei, we've been over this already so please don't start that again." Asuka cried out, already feeling emotionally drained from trying to get Rei to see the error in her logical reasoning regarding clothes.  
"丽，我们已经讨论过这个问题了，所以请不要再开始了。" 明日香喊道，已经感到情绪上筋疲力尽，试图让丽看到她在逻辑推理关于衣服方面的错误。

"Can I go in now….please?" an impatient Aki asked everyone present, hoping to start.  
"我现在可以进去了吗……请？" 一个不耐烦的秋问道在场所有人，希望能开始。

Kneeling to Aki's level again, Asuka gave Aki a gentle caress to her face. "Yes, you can go in now Schätzchen." Asuka said though she was still uneasy about her baby going in a much too large pool. "Remember to follow Rei's instructions and me and Papa will be right here if you need us..ok?"  
再次跪在 Aki 的身边，Asuka 温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊。“是的，你现在可以进去了，宝贝。”Asuka 说道，尽管她对女儿进入一个过于大的泳池仍感到不安。“记得要听 Rei 的指示，我和爸爸会一直在这里，如果你需要我们的话...好吗？”

"Ooh..ok." Aki pouted, still somewhat peeved at her Mama's overprotectiveness. Hearing something soft hitting the water, Aki saw a few of the inflatables her Papa blew up being tossed into the pool by him.  
“哦...好吧。”Aki 噘着嘴，对她妈妈的过度保护仍有些不悦。听到一些柔软的东西落入水中的声音，Aki 看到她爸爸吹起的几个充气玩具被他扔进了泳池。

"Papa! I said I don't need any floaty things!" Aki called out, clearly getting angry.  
“爸爸！我说了我不需要任何漂浮的东西！”Aki 大声喊道，显然变得生气了。

"It's just a precaution sweetie. Just in case you need something to hold onto in the deep water, ok?" Shinji told her and leaving no room for discussion.  
“这只是预防措施，亲爱的。万一你在深水区需要抓点什么东西呢，好吗？” 真嗣告诉她，不容分说。

Aki again pouted but deep down she was secretly thankful to her Papa for putting those things into the pool. She wouldn't admit that even now she was a bit scared of the deep end of the pool and that having something to hold on to around just in case helped ease her worries.  
阿基再次撅嘴，但内心深处她暗自感激爸爸在泳池里放了那些东西。她不会承认，即使现在她对泳池深水区还是有点害怕，有东西可以抓着以防万一确实缓解了她的担忧。

PenPen, who had been swimming around lazily for a bit took the chance to climb onto the inflatable bed and started relaxing on it. His first attempt at making Aki jealous of his aqua prowess had failed. Maybe if he waited for a bit for the brown-haired terror to get better and challenge her later would be better, he thought.  
一直在懒洋洋游泳的 PenPen 趁机爬上了充气床，开始在上面放松。他第一次试图让阿基嫉妒他的水上功夫失败了。也许他应该等一会儿，等那个棕发小魔头进步后再挑战她，他心想。

Rei got into the shallow end of the pool first before helping Aki in. At first, Aki nervously panicked and splashed when the water came up, reaching up to her nose when her feet touched the floor, even swallowing a bit of the water an action that made Asuka almost jump straight into the pool in an attempt to rescue her daughter but Rei had grabbed Aki before she could.  
丽首先进入了泳池的浅水区，然后帮助明进入。起初，明紧张地惊慌失措，水花四溅，当她的脚触到池底时，水位上升到了她的鼻子，甚至吞下了一点水，这一举动让明日香几乎直接跳进泳池试图救她的女儿，但丽在明日香之前抓住了明。

Coughing a few times Aki was gently lowered again into the water by Rei, this time Aki tilted her head up to ensure she could breathe. Asuka seeing this was conflicted on whether to just join in but didn't want to make Aki angrier with her than she already was. Feeling her hand being gently grabbed, Asuka turned to see her beloved Idiot giving her a comforting and reassuring smile.  
明咳嗽了几声，丽再次温柔地将她放入水中，这次明抬起头确保自己能呼吸。明日香看到这一幕，内心矛盾是否应该加入，但又不想让明对她更加生气。感觉到自己的手被轻轻握住，明日香转头看到她心爱的傻瓜给了她一个安慰和鼓励的微笑。

"Hey don't worry. She's in good hands with Rei." Shinji told her.  
“嘿，别担心。她和丽在一起很安全。”真嗣告诉她。

Sighing while slumping her shoulders, trying to relieve the tension she felt. "How can you be so calm right now? Weren't you just as nervous about this as me a few minutes ago?" Asuka asked, wondering how Shinji can be ok with this now.  
叹了口气，她垂下肩膀试图缓解紧张感。“你怎么能现在这么冷静？几分钟前你不也和我一样紧张吗？”明日香问道，好奇真嗣现在怎么能接受这一切。

"Well..remember when I told you the times I had before you arrived and how Rei protected me from the Angel?" Shinji said with Asuka nodding, remembering back in the post-impact world the times when she had asked Shinji about his experience then. "Well, before the battle happened Rei had made a promise..a vow to me that I wouldn't die, that she would protect me." Shinji told her as both of them looked at Rei and Aki, the blue-haired teen was now teaching her little charge how to float on her back. "And just now Rei made a promise, a vow that nothing will happen to Aki and I trust her to keep that."  
“嗯……记得我告诉过你我来到你之前的那段时间，以及绫波是如何保护我免受使徒伤害的吗？”真嗣说道，明日香点头，回想起在冲击后的世界里她曾询问真嗣那时的经历。“好吧，在战斗发生之前，绫波曾向我许下了一个承诺……一个誓言，说我不会死，她会保护我。”真嗣告诉她，两人看着绫波和 Aki，蓝发少女正在教她的小跟班如何仰泳。“而就在刚才，绫波又许下了一个承诺，一个誓言，说 Aki 不会有事，我相信她会遵守的。”

"Well, it's so touching that you have such complete trust in her." Asuka said in a sarcastic tone as she turned her face away from him.  
“好吧，你对她如此完全的信任真是感人至深。”明日香带着讽刺的语气说道，转过脸不再看他。

'_Oh boy_.' Shinji thought. It had been a long time since he'd seen this side of Asuka, not counting when they had to 'act' during their return to this time. He could tell that Asuka was just agitated with the situation. Even now she turned her attention back to her daughter in the pool, constantly watching her, anticipating something to go wrong at any given moment.  
“哦，天哪。”真嗣心想。他已经很久没见过明日香这一面了，除了他们不得不“表演”回到这个时代的那些时刻。他能看出明日香只是对这种情况感到烦躁。即便现在，她也将注意力转回到泳池中的女儿身上，时刻注视着她，随时准备应对可能出错的事情。

Shinji wished he could do something to make his wife at ease with all this. Giving her a look, his mind shamelessly went into perverted territory upon seeing her in that red and white striped two-piece swimsuit.  
真嗣希望自己能做些什么让妻子在这种环境下放松下来。看着她，他的思绪无耻地飘向了色情的领域，尤其是在看到她穿着那件红白条纹的两件式泳衣时。

Admittedly out of all the swimsuits he had seen her wear, including some very sexy and more revealing ones before they travelled back in time, this one was both his favourite and most memorable. He chuckled at the memory of when he first learned of thermal expansion and at this very same place no doubt.  
说实话，在他见过的所有泳衣中，包括他们穿越时空前那些非常性感且更为暴露的款式，这件既是他最喜欢的也是最难忘的。他轻笑出声，想起了自己第一次学到热膨胀概念的时候，无疑就是在同一个地方。

Like a bolt of lightning, an idea had hit him, one that would benefit not only from distracting Asuka from the current situation, but would also definitely be enjoyable for them both like so many times before. He just hoped that he would be able to pull it off without being screamed at or worse smacked for suggesting it.  
犹如一道闪电，一个念头击中了他，这个主意不仅能转移明日香对当前情况的注意力，而且肯定能像以往许多次那样让他们双方都感到愉快。他只是希望自己能在不被尖叫或更糟的被扇耳光的情况下提出这个建议。

Taking a chance, Shinji kneeled behind Asuka before hugging her tightly making her flinch at the contact for a brief moment. "Hey, Asuka. Can you teach me again about thermal expansion?" Shinji whispered in her ear.  
冒险一试，真嗣跪在明日香身后紧紧抱住她，让她因这突如其来的接触而短暂地一颤。“嘿，明日香。你能再教我一次关于热膨胀的知识吗？”真嗣在她耳边低语。

"Thermal expansion? What are you talking about…" Asuka wondered what her Baka was talking about before it clicked in her head, making her gasp and turn her head back to him, her face bright red. "You..you perverted hentai." Asuka whispered, but Shinji could tell that she was getting excited.  
“热膨胀？你在说什么…”明日香疑惑她的笨蛋在说什么，随后恍然大悟，让她倒吸一口气转头看向他，脸颊通红。“你…你这个变态 hentai。”明日香低声说，但真嗣能感觉到她开始兴奋起来。

Seeing that she wasn't against it, Shinji stood up and brought Asuka up by her hand before walking away and in the direction of the changing rooms.  
见她并不反对，真嗣站起身来，牵着明日香的手，朝更衣室的方向走去。

"Wha..wait, what about..?" Asuka resisted a bit, looking towards their daughter once again, seeing that Rei was now helping Aki learn how to paddle by walking back, Aki holding on to the blue-haired girl's hands as she kicked her legs repeatedly. Neither of them paid attention to the two young parents.  
“什...等等，那...？”明日香有些抗拒，再次看向他们的女儿，只见丽正在帮助阿基学习如何划水，阿基抓着蓝发女孩的手，双腿不停地踢动。两人都没有注意到这对年轻的父母。

"She's fine, trust me and trust Rei as well." Shinji said to her as he once again pulled her along and was thankful that Asuka's resistance finally crumbled as they finally reached the entrance of the changing room before going in.  
“她没事的，相信我，也相信丽。”真嗣对她说道，再次拉着她前行，庆幸明日香的抵抗终于瓦解，他们终于到达了更衣室的入口，随后走了进去。

So hearing those similar words from her, Shinji knew that Rei would do anything in her power to keep that promise and look after Aki, knowing for sure that she was in safe hands.  
因此，当再次听到她类似的承诺时，真嗣知道丽会尽其所能去履行那个诺言，照顾好明，他确信她会得到妥善的保护。

After a few short minutes of changing into their swimwear, Shinji came out first, wearing some new purple swim trunks. While he was waiting for the girls proceeded to blow up a few inflatables for the pool that he bought on the way. Just as he was blowing up a lilo bed, the girls finally come out. Aki in her red kiddie swimsuit, Asuka in her red and white two-piece swimsuit (something which Shinji was once again thankful to see again), but the surprise (or lack of it) was that Rei was just wearing her standard school swimsuit.  
几分钟后，换上泳装的真嗣率先走了出来，穿着一条新的紫色泳裤。他一边等待女孩们，一边开始给路上买的几个充气泳池玩具充气。正当他给一个充气床垫吹气时，女孩们终于出来了。绫穿着她的红色儿童泳装，明日香则穿着红白相间的两件式泳装（真嗣再次为此感到庆幸），而令人意外（或并不意外）的是，丽只是穿着她平常的学校泳装。

He wasn't the only one who was surprised as Asuka gave Rei a dull look.  
感到惊讶的不止他一个，明日香对丽投以了无趣的目光。

"We need to get you some new swimwear Rei." Asuka said, making a mental note to remember to go clothes shopping with the blue-haired teen.  
“我们需要给你买些新的泳装，丽。”明日香说道，心里记下了要带蓝发少女去购物的念头。

"It's suffi.." Rei began to say.  
"这已经足够……" 丽开始说道。

"Rei, we've been over this already so please don't start that again." Asuka cried out, already feeling emotionally drained from trying to get Rei to see the error in her logical reasoning regarding clothes.  
"丽，我们已经讨论过这个问题了，所以请不要再开始了。" 明日香喊道，已经感到情绪上筋疲力尽，试图让丽看到她在逻辑推理关于衣服方面的错误。

"Can I go in now….please?" an impatient Aki asked everyone present, hoping to start.  
"我现在可以进去了吗……请？" 一个不耐烦的秋问道在场所有人，希望能开始。

Kneeling to Aki's level again, Asuka gave Aki a gentle caress to her face. "Yes, you can go in now Schätzchen." Asuka said though she was still uneasy about her baby going in a much too large pool. "Remember to follow Rei's instructions and me and Papa will be right here if you need us..ok?"  
再次跪在 Aki 的身边，Asuka 温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊。“是的，你现在可以进去了，宝贝。”Asuka 说道，尽管她对女儿进入一个过于大的泳池仍感到不安。“记得要听 Rei 的指示，我和爸爸会一直在这里，如果你需要我们的话...好吗？”

"Ooh..ok." Aki pouted, still somewhat peeved at her Mama's overprotectiveness. Hearing something soft hitting the water, Aki saw a few of the inflatables her Papa blew up being tossed into the pool by him.  
“哦...好吧。”Aki 噘着嘴，对她妈妈的过度保护仍有些不悦。听到一些柔软的东西落入水中的声音，Aki 看到她爸爸吹起的几个充气玩具被他扔进了泳池。

"Papa! I said I don't need any floaty things!" Aki called out, clearly getting angry.  
“爸爸！我说了我不需要任何漂浮的东西！”Aki 大声喊道，显然变得生气了。

"It's just a precaution sweetie. Just in case you need something to hold onto in the deep water, ok?" Shinji told her and leaving no room for discussion.  
“这只是预防措施，亲爱的。万一你在深水区需要抓点什么东西呢，好吗？” 真嗣告诉她，不容分说。

Aki again pouted but deep down she was secretly thankful to her Papa for putting those things into the pool. She wouldn't admit that even now she was a bit scared of the deep end of the pool and that having something to hold on to around just in case helped ease her worries.  
阿基再次撅嘴，但内心深处她暗自感激爸爸在泳池里放了那些东西。她不会承认，即使现在她对泳池深水区还是有点害怕，有东西可以抓着以防万一确实缓解了她的担忧。

PenPen, who had been swimming around lazily for a bit took the chance to climb onto the inflatable bed and started relaxing on it. His first attempt at making Aki jealous of his aqua prowess had failed. Maybe if he waited for a bit for the brown-haired terror to get better and challenge her later would be better, he thought.  
一直在懒洋洋游泳的 PenPen 趁机爬上了充气床，开始在上面放松。他第一次试图让阿基嫉妒他的水上功夫失败了。也许他应该等一会儿，等那个棕发小魔头进步后再挑战她，他心想。

Rei got into the shallow end of the pool first before helping Aki in. At first, Aki nervously panicked and splashed when the water came up, reaching up to her nose when her feet touched the floor, even swallowing a bit of the water an action that made Asuka almost jump straight into the pool in an attempt to rescue her daughter but Rei had grabbed Aki before she could.  
丽首先进入了泳池的浅水区，然后帮助明进入。起初，明紧张地惊慌失措，水花四溅，当她的脚触到池底时，水位上升到了她的鼻子，甚至吞下了一点水，这一举动让明日香几乎直接跳进泳池试图救她的女儿，但丽在明日香之前抓住了明。

Coughing a few times Aki was gently lowered again into the water by Rei, this time Aki tilted her head up to ensure she could breathe. Asuka seeing this was conflicted on whether to just join in but didn't want to make Aki angrier with her than she already was. Feeling her hand being gently grabbed, Asuka turned to see her beloved Idiot giving her a comforting and reassuring smile.  
明咳嗽了几声，丽再次温柔地将她放入水中，这次明抬起头确保自己能呼吸。明日香看到这一幕，内心矛盾是否应该加入，但又不想让明对她更加生气。感觉到自己的手被轻轻握住，明日香转头看到她心爱的傻瓜给了她一个安慰和鼓励的微笑。

"Hey don't worry. She's in good hands with Rei." Shinji told her.  
“嘿，别担心。她和丽在一起很安全。”真嗣告诉她。

Sighing while slumping her shoulders, trying to relieve the tension she felt. "How can you be so calm right now? Weren't you just as nervous about this as me a few minutes ago?" Asuka asked, wondering how Shinji can be ok with this now.  
叹了口气，她垂下肩膀试图缓解紧张感。“你怎么能现在这么冷静？几分钟前你不也和我一样紧张吗？”明日香问道，好奇真嗣现在怎么能接受这一切。

"Well..remember when I told you the times I had before you arrived and how Rei protected me from the Angel?" Shinji said with Asuka nodding, remembering back in the post-impact world the times when she had asked Shinji about his experience then. "Well, before the battle happened Rei had made a promise..a vow to me that I wouldn't die, that she would protect me." Shinji told her as both of them looked at Rei and Aki, the blue-haired teen was now teaching her little charge how to float on her back. "And just now Rei made a promise, a vow that nothing will happen to Aki and I trust her to keep that."  
“嗯……记得我告诉过你我来到你之前的那段时间，以及绫波是如何保护我免受使徒伤害的吗？”真嗣说道，明日香点头，回想起在冲击后的世界里她曾询问真嗣那时的经历。“好吧，在战斗发生之前，绫波曾向我许下了一个承诺……一个誓言，说我不会死，她会保护我。”真嗣告诉她，两人看着绫波和 Aki，蓝发少女正在教她的小跟班如何仰泳。“而就在刚才，绫波又许下了一个承诺，一个誓言，说 Aki 不会有事，我相信她会遵守的。”

"Well, it's so touching that you have such complete trust in her." Asuka said in a sarcastic tone as she turned her face away from him.  
“好吧，你对她如此完全的信任真是感人至深。”明日香带着讽刺的语气说道，转过脸不再看他。

'_Oh boy_.' Shinji thought. It had been a long time since he'd seen this side of Asuka, not counting when they had to 'act' during their return to this time.

“她没事的，相信我，也相信丽。”真嗣对她说道，再次拉着她前行，庆幸明日香的抵抗终于瓦解，他们终于到达了更衣室的入口，随后走了进去。

x-x-x-x-x-x

Shinji and Asuka didn't know actually how long they were in the changing room. Was it a few minutes, half an hour maybe? They just knew that it must have been a bit as once they returned to the pool area Aki was calling out to them, wondering where they were.  
真嗣和明日香其实并不知道他们在更衣室里待了多久。是几分钟，还是半小时左右？他们只知道一定有一段时间了，因为当他们回到泳池区时，阿基正在呼唤他们，想知道他们去了哪里。

"Ah, Mama, Papa! There you are!" Aki cheerfully called out to them, looking happy to see them as she was holding onto the pool edge, no longer having any trace of anger or annoyance at them. "Where have you been?" Aki questioned her parents.  
“啊，妈妈，爸爸！你们在这儿呢！”阿基高兴地向他们喊道，看起来很高兴见到他们，她正抓着泳池边缘，不再有任何愤怒或烦恼的痕迹。“你们去哪儿了？”阿基问她的父母。

At that question both parents tried to come up with an excuse, especially a very good one and one that would explain why the two were slightly out of breath, having a full body blush and both their hair looking a bit dishevelled with Asuka's being the wildest. Also, they prayed to God that Aki wouldn't notice the few bite and scratch marks on Shinji's body.  
面对这个问题，两位家长试图想出一个借口，尤其是非常合理且能解释为什么两人都有些气喘吁吁、满脸通红、头发凌乱，尤其是明日香的头发最为狂野。此外，他们祈祷阿基不会注意到真嗣身上那几处咬痕和抓痕。

"Oh err.." Asuka and Shinji said in sync, desperately trying to come up with something. "We were at..at the gym, Schätzchen." Asuka finally came out with an excuse.  
"哦，呃..." 明日香和真嗣异口同声地说道，拼命地想找借口。"我们在...在健身房，亲爱的。" 明日香终于编出了一个理由。

Aki looked a bit confused, tilting her head to the side as she was holding on to the pool edge. "The Jim?"  
阿基看起来有些困惑，歪着头抓着泳池边。"健身房？"

"Err yeah honey. I and Mama thought to get some more exercise while you were busy with Rei." Shinji tried to make their feeble excuse more plausible.  
"呃，是的，宝贝。我和妈妈觉得在你忙于和丽在一起的时候，我们可以多做些运动。" 真嗣试图让他们的蹩脚借口听起来更可信些。

"Yeah and we all know that Papa needs to exercise a bit more." Asuka added in with more confidence in this white lie as well as a jab at Shinji's current physique.  
“是啊，我们都知道爸爸需要多锻炼一下。”明日香带着更多的自信补充道，这既是一个善意的谎言，也是对真嗣当前体型的调侃。

"Oh…Ok!" Aki cheerfully accepted, much to the relief of Asuka and Shinji.  
“哦…好的！”绫愉快地接受了，这让明日香和真嗣都松了一口气。

However, both parents noticed that Rei was giving them a look, well her usual blank stare but the two could tell that Rei knew exactly what they had been doing and Asuka couldn't help but feel that Rei was judging them.  
然而，两位家长都注意到绫波在看着他们，虽然她一如既往地面无表情，但他们能感觉到绫波完全知道他们刚才在做什么，明日香不禁觉得绫波在评判他们。

'_Hey don't judge us.'_ Asuka thought angrily while giving the blue-haired girl a hard look.  
“嘿，别评判我们。”明日香生气地想着，同时狠狠地瞪了那个蓝发女孩一眼。

"Mama, Papa! Watch me, watch me!" Aki shouted to get their attention and Rei got the signal from her little friend as she held her afloat by her belly on the water. Now in the right plank position, Aki started kicking her feet in the water, it getting more wildly till the point that water was splashing everywhere behind her. At that Rei gently removed her hand under Aki to which to the surprise of Asuka and Shinji, Aki shot forward like a mini boat engine.  
“妈妈，爸爸！看我，看我！”阿基大喊着吸引他们的注意，而丽从小朋友那里得到了信号，她用手托着阿基的肚子让她浮在水面上。现在处于正确的平板位置，阿基开始踢动双脚，水花越来越狂野，直到她身后四处飞溅。这时，丽轻轻地从阿基下面抽出手，令明日香和真嗣惊讶的是，阿基像迷你船用引擎一样向前冲去。

Aki kept going and going, with Rei following close behind her, till she was already at the other side of the very deep end of the pool with the blue-haired teen making sure to help Aki keep afloat. PenPen, who was relaxing on the inflatable bed, was unfortunately caught in Aki's path and was knocked over and fell into the water. After surfacing his head above the water, he glared at the little terror.  
阿基继续前进，丽紧随其后，直到她已经到达泳池深水区的另一边，蓝发少女确保帮助阿基保持浮力。正在充气床上放松的 PenPen 不幸被卷入阿基的路径，被撞翻落入水中。浮出水面后，他怒视着这个小捣蛋鬼。

"Did you watch me Mama, Papa!?" Aki shouted as she waved her arm at them from afar.  
"妈妈，爸爸，你们看到我了吗！？" 阿基从远处向他们挥手大喊。

To say that Asuka and Shinji were stunned was an understatement. They were gone for a few minutes at best and Aki had already learned how to doggy paddle like a speeding torpedo.  
说真嗣和明日香震惊都太轻描淡写了。他们离开不过几分钟，阿基就已经学会了像鱼雷一样快速地狗刨游泳。

"Mama, Papa!?" Aki called out again snapping them out of their surprise.  
"妈妈，爸爸！？" 阿基再次呼唤，让他们从惊讶中回过神来。

"That's..that's wunderbar Schätzchen!" Asuka praised her daughter. It finally kicked in how proud she was that Aki had learned to swim like this so quickly in the short time they were away.  
“那真是……太棒了，宝贝！”明日香夸奖她的女儿。她终于意识到自己有多么自豪，阿基在这么短的时间内就学会了游泳，而且进步如此之快。

"Yeah, that's amazing honey, well done!" Shinji added in, also showing pride in his little girl. Granted, Aki still needed to work on swimming properly but it was still amazing for him to see.  
“是啊，太了不起了，亲爱的，干得好！”真嗣补充道，同样为自己的小女儿感到骄傲。当然，阿基还需要继续努力学习正确的游泳技巧，但对他来说，这已经非常令人惊叹了。

Heck, it had taken him way longer to swim under Asuka's tutelage, though he clearly remembered the main reason why it had taken him much longer. The times when it was just the two of them before Aki was born and that Asuka teaching him had turned into 'fun' times around the lake for the both of them, especially when Asuka decide to skinny d…  
见鬼，他在明日香的指导下学会游泳花了更长的时间，尽管他清楚地记得主要原因是什么。在阿基出生之前，只有他们两个人的时候，明日香教他游泳变成了湖边‘有趣’的时光，尤其是当明日香决定裸泳时……

Shinji's thoughts were immediately interrupted when he felt himself being pushed into the pool. Shock and confusion hit him for a moment while he splashed into the water for a second before resurfacing and looking at the culprit who pushed him - which, of course, had been Asuka herself who was now looking down at him with an annoyed look and her hands on her hip.  
当真嗣感觉到自己被推进泳池时，他的思绪立刻被打断了。震惊和困惑在他落水的那一刻袭来，他在水中扑腾了一会儿才重新浮出水面，看向那个推他的人——当然，正是明日香，她现在正双手叉腰，低头看着他，脸上带着恼怒的表情。

"You were thinking of something dirty again, you hentai." Asuka said while she lean her upper body forward while on the edge of the pool. "Honestly you pervert, haven't you had enough?" she finished with a bit of blush on her face.  
“你又在想什么下流的事情了吧，你这个变态。”明日香站在泳池边，上半身微微前倾说道，“说真的，你这个色狼，还没受够吗？”她脸上泛起一丝红晕，结束了这番话。

"Of you never." Shinji cheeky said with a smirk on his face before he quietly grabbed Asuka by her hands and pulled her into the pool too, surprising her greatly.  
“对你永远不会。”真嗣带着一丝调皮的笑容说道，然后悄悄地抓住明日香的手，将她也拉进了泳池，让她大吃一惊。

As Asuka resurfaced and was searching for Shinji, ready to give him some payback but was surprised again when she felt him grab and hug her tightly from behind, even feeling him lovingly kiss her neck before kissing her lip when she turned her head around to him.  
当明日香浮出水面寻找真嗣，准备给他点颜色瞧瞧时，却再次惊讶地感觉到他从背后紧紧抓住并拥抱了她，甚至感受到他深情地亲吻她的脖子，当她转过头来时，他又吻了她的唇。

"Mama! Papa!" Aki called out to them, breaking them out of their own little world. Aki was already once again swimming torpedoing towards them at great speed before she finally reached them; Asuka grabbing and hugging her daughter tightly in her arms.  
“妈妈！爸爸！”爱希大声呼唤他们，打破了他们的小世界。爱希再次以极快的速度向他们游来，最终到达他们身边；明日香紧紧抱住女儿，将她拥入怀中。

The gang would stay at the NERV pool for another few hours till Aki was very tired, even falling asleep long before they reached home but nonetheless, Aki's first day of learning to swim had been a great success.  
这群人会在 NERV 的泳池边再待上几个小时，直到爱希非常疲惫，甚至在回家前就已熟睡，但无论如何，爱希学习游泳的第一天取得了巨大的成功。

**Omake:**

Misato was tirelessly doing some stupid reports, even wondering why she still needed to do this even when the war with the angels was over, when PenPen walked up to see, catching her attention.  
美里无休止地做着那些愚蠢的报告，甚至在天使战争结束后还在想为什么还需要做这些，这时企鹅潘潘走了过来，吸引了她的注意。

"Oh hey, PenPen, did you have a good time today at the pool with the kids?" the purpled-haired woman asked her small roommate.  
“哦嘿，潘潘，今天在泳池和孩子们玩得开心吗？”紫发女子问她的小室友。

PenPen didn't respond, only staring at her before lifting his claw out as if expecting something.  
潘潘没有回应，只是盯着她，然后举起爪子，好像在期待什么。

Misato stared at him for a second before sighing and reaching for something next to her. A brown paper bag. "Fine here's your payment as promised."  
美里盯着他看了一会儿，然后叹了口气，伸手去拿旁边的东西。一个棕色纸袋。“好吧，这是你应得的报酬。”

PenPen grabbed the bag from the woman and opened it, finding the contents to be a bottle of whisky before quickly opening it to Misato's surprise, the bird drank the whole thing in one go before giving a big burp and falling on his side fast asleep a second later.  
企鹅 PenPen 从女人手中抢过袋子，打开一看，里面是一瓶威士忌，还没等美里反应过来，这只鸟就一口气把整瓶酒喝了个精光，然后打了个大嗝，随即侧身倒下，不一会儿就睡着了。

"Jesus, PenPen. I know Aki can be a little terror, but it couldn't have been that bad today could it?" Misato asked the penguin though she wouldn't be getting a response from the now knocked-out drunk fowl anytime soon.  
“天哪，PenPen。我知道阿基有时候挺让人头疼的，但今天应该没那么糟糕吧？”美里对着那只已经醉倒的企鹅问道，不过她知道短时间内是得不到任何回应了。

### Chapter 12 Trip to the Aquarium  
Chapter 12 水族馆之旅

"This is soo awesome! It's soo damn cool!" Kensuke excitedly voiced out loudly as he held his handheld camera, recording everything while running around the place taking in everything from the area and facility which was just the seaside in old Tokyo 2.  
"这太棒了！真是酷毙了！" 健介兴奋地大声说道，他手持便携式摄像机，一边跑来跑去记录着一切，尽情欣赏着这片旧东京海滨区域和设施。

"Fishy, fishy, fishy! I wanna see some fishies!" Aki's voiced her excitement alongside Kensuke's. The only thing preventing her from running around like the military nerd was Rei firmly securing her hand in hers, as per instruction by Asuka and Shinji.  
"鱼儿，鱼儿，鱼儿！我想看小鱼！" 阿基和健介一样兴奋地喊道。要不是丽紧紧握住她的手，按照明日香和真嗣的指示，她早就和那个军事迷一样四处奔跑了。

"Geez, I don't know who's more like a little kid. My Schätzchen or the military nut?" Asuka said to everyone present, which was her, Shinji, Toji, Hikari and Rei.  
“天哪，我都不知道谁更像小孩子了。我的宝贝还是那个军事狂？”明日香对在场的每个人说，包括她自己、真嗣、渡边、光和丽。

"Also didn't Kensuke keep saying before that his hobby was military stuff? So why is he excited over an aquarium facility?" Hikari wondered also and even looked to her boyfriend for answers to which Toji just shrugged his shoulders while he sighed.  
“话说回来，健介之前不是一直说他喜欢军事吗？那他为什么会对一个水族馆设施这么兴奋？”光也感到疑惑，甚至看向她的男朋友寻求答案，而渡边只是耸了耸肩，叹了口气。

"It's amazing a place like this even exists. After the second impact, the marine wildlife was in complete disarray and many species were on the verge of extinction so the UN made these facilities around the world in hopes of preserving the sea life," Kensuke now rambled on, completely missing the light jabs towards him in his over-excitement. Finally he turned towards his friends, especially Asuka and Shinji, him focusing his camera too close to their faces, much to the irritation on Asuka's part. "How did you get us access to this facility!?" Kensuke asked questionably.  
“这个地方能存在真是太神奇了。第二次冲击后，海洋生物完全陷入混乱，许多物种濒临灭绝，所以联合国在全球建立了这些设施，希望能保护海洋生物。”健介现在滔滔不绝地说着，完全没注意到大家对他的轻微调侃，他太兴奋了。最后，他转向他的朋友们，特别是明日香和真嗣，他把相机对准他们的脸，这让明日香感到非常不爽。“你们是怎么让我们进入这个设施的？！”健介好奇地问道。

"First of all Aida, get that camera out of my face!" Asuka firmly told Kensuke while roughly grabbing the camera with her hand and forcibly removing it from her personal space.  
“首先，Aida，把那相机从我面前拿开！” 明日香坚定地对真希波说，同时粗暴地用手抓住相机，强行将其从自己的私人空间移开。

"Yeah, come to think of it, I'm wondering how we're allowed to come here when it's not even open to the public yet? Not that I'm thankful for the invitation guys," Toji said to the Ikari family who were the ones that invited them in the first place.  
“是啊，说起来，我还在想我们怎么能在还没对外开放的时候就进来呢？虽然我并不感谢你们的邀请，” 冬二对邀请他们的碇家说道。

"Well, all thanks go to Mr Kaji. He's..err friends with some people who work here," Shinji informed his friend.  
“嗯，这都要感谢加持先生。他和这里的一些工作人员……呃，是朋友，” 真嗣向他的朋友解释道。

Shinji remembered when a few days ago that Aki along with PenPen was watching a documentary on sea life which got the little girl excited and wishing to see some of the fishies. To everyone's surprise, Kaji asked if they indeed wanted to see some. The supposedly old spy had some friends or connections to the place which Shinji even asked the man about. Kaji's response was simply, 'if I told you then I would have to make you disappear_'_, with a wink and Shinji ultimately decided to not inquire more.  
真嗣记得几天前，Aki 和 PenPen 一起看了一部关于海洋生物的纪录片，这让小女孩兴奋不已，渴望亲眼看看那些鱼儿。令所有人惊讶的是，加持问他们是否真的想去看。这位看似老练的间谍似乎与那个地方有些朋友或联系，真嗣甚至向那人询问过。加持的回答很简单：‘如果我告诉了你，那我就得让你消失’，还眨了眨眼，真嗣最终决定不再追问。

"He did tell us that there were a few conditions though," Shinji said remembering what was told beforehand.  
“他确实告诉过我们有一些条件，”真嗣回忆起之前被告知的内容。

"Wait, what conditions?" Toji asked his friend somewhat fearing what those conditions could be.  
“等等，什么条件？” 冬二问他的朋友，有些担心那些条件会是什么。

"Well, first he told us that Aki is not to cause trouble at the facility since he's well aware of how destructive err…adventurous she can be when she's overexcited and hyper." Shinji sighed, the incidents when Aki wandered around NERV HQ and her destructive rampage on the Katsuragi apartment when on a sugar/caffeine high was the solid reason why Kaji firmly told them to keep Aki on a supervised leash.  
“嗯，首先他告诉我们，阿基不得在该设施惹麻烦，因为他很清楚她过度兴奋和亢奋时能有多么破坏性……或者说多么爱冒险。”真嗣叹了口气，阿基在 NERV 总部四处游荡以及她在咖啡因/糖分高涨时对葛城公寓的破坏性狂潮，是加持坚决要求他们严加看管阿基的坚实理由。

"Err..ok and what's the other condition then?" Toji asked.  
“呃……好吧，那另一个条件是什么？”冬二问道。

"The other thing is that at the end of this, we have to..fill out a survey. It's for when they do officially start letting actual visitors come in," Shinji sheepishly let out, somewhat knowing that his friend wouldn't like that part and judging by the look on Toji's face he was right.  
“另一件事是，到最后我们得……填写一份调查问卷。这是为了在他们正式开始允许实际访客进入时准备的，”真嗣有些尴尬地透露，多少预料到他的朋友不会喜欢这部分，而从冬二的表情来看，他猜对了。

"Wait what!? Dude, I thought this was going to be a great day out and you drop the bomb on me that we have to do some stupid survey," Toji complained about not liking the idea of filling out a long survey. "Man, this is feeling like a boring school field trip already."  
"等等什么！？伙计，我以为今天会是愉快的一天，结果你突然告诉我得填个无聊的调查问卷，" 真嗣抱怨道，他不喜欢填写冗长的问卷。"天哪，这感觉已经像是一次无聊的学校实地考察了。"

"Toji! You're being rude," Hikari chastised her boyfriend. "We get a free tour around this place courtesy of Mr Kaji and our friends, so filling out a simple survey is the least we can do."  
"真嗣！你这样很没礼貌，" 明日香责备她的男朋友。"我们能免费参观这个地方，多亏了加持先生和我们的朋友们，填个简单的问卷是我们最起码能做的。"

"Ah, man," Toji whined out knowing his girlfriend was right.  
"啊，天哪，" 真嗣抱怨道，知道他的女朋友说得对。"

Before the teen jock could complain any further, a blonde long haired female with glasses and a white lab coat, who worked here finally came out to greet the group.  
在少年运动员还没来得及进一步抱怨之前，一位金发长发、戴着眼镜、身着白色实验服的女性终于走了出来，迎接这群人。她是这里的工作人员。

"Hello everyone and welcome to our facility which is Japan's top Marine Ecosystem Preservation Research Organisation. I'm Chisato Ushio, a head researcher here and you are the kids that Mr Kaji told us about, right?" the female scientist asked.  
“大家好，欢迎来到我们日本顶尖的海洋生态保护研究机构。我是这里的首席研究员，鹭森希里。你们就是加治先生提到过的孩子们，对吧？”这位女科学家问道。

Shinji being somewhat the group's leader went up to the older woman. "Yeah, that's us and thank you for having us, Miss Ushio," Shinji replied as he did a formal bow to the woman, still somewhat wondering how Kaji is connected to this place.  
作为小组领头人的真嗣走向那位年长的女性。“是的，就是我们，感谢您接待我们，鹭森小姐。”真嗣回答道，并向她鞠了一躬，心中仍有些疑惑加治是如何与这个地方联系上的。

"Oh it's fine Mr Ikari, and if I'm reading this right there are eight of you, right? Six teenagers, one child and a…err a penguin?" Miss Ushio finished reading the guest list with the last one confusing her. She took a moment to look at the group and her eyes were not deceiving her that, yes, there was a penguin among them.  
"哦，没关系，碇先生，如果我没看错的话，你们一共有八个人，对吧？六个青少年，一个孩子，还有一个……呃，一只企鹅？" 宇塩小姐念完访客名单，最后一位让她有些困惑。她稍作停顿，仔细打量了这群人，确认自己的眼睛没有看错，确实有一只企鹅混在其中。

"Wark!" PenPen let out while lifting his claw to acknowledge his presence to the woman.  
"哇克！" 彭彭举起爪子，向那位女士示意自己的存在。

"Err…ok moving on then. We're very happy and excited that you came here at this aquarium facility and very thankful for you lot being one of the many groups to come to our facility. While we are planning to open to the public in a few months, it's still nice for feedback from kids of your age group."  
"呃……好吧，那我们继续。非常高兴和激动你们能来到这个水族馆设施，也非常感谢你们成为众多来访团体中的一员。虽然我们计划在几个月后对公众开放，但能从你们这个年龄段的孩子那里得到反馈，还是非常不错的。"

"Wait, so we're not the only visitors here?" Hikari asked even looking around to see if there was anyone else besides them.  
"等等，所以我们不是这里唯一的访客？" 光环顾四周，想看看是否还有其他人。

"That's correct. A few groups who came earlier are already inside," Miss Ushio explained before reaching into her coat pockets and pulling out a remote which she pressed and the doors to the main entrance opened slowly. "Now before we enter the main facility we need you kids to go through a very short decontamination cycle," Miss Ushio said while giving the kids a strange smile.  
"没错。几组早些时候到达的人已经在里面了，" 乌城小姐解释道，然后伸手从外套口袋里掏出一个遥控器，按下按钮，主入口的门缓缓打开。"现在进入主设施之前，我们需要你们这些孩子先进行一个非常简短的除污循环，" 乌城小姐说着，向孩子们露出了一个奇怪的微笑。

The group looked at the woman in confusion. "Decontamination cycle?" Shinji, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke and Hikari all said together in confusion while Aki, while confused herself was mumbling the very difficult word of the day.  
众人困惑地看着那位女士。"除污循环？" 真嗣、明日香、阿斯、健介和光异口同声地问道，而阿基虽然也感到困惑，却喃喃自语着这个难懂的词汇。

x-x-x-x-x

"OH GOD FINALLY!" Asuka and Toji shouted out in a mix of relief and anger as the group's ordeal finally came to an end as the metal doors to the next area opened up.  
“哦，天哪，终于结束了！” 明日香和冬二带着解脱与愤怒的复杂情绪喊道，随着通往下一个区域的金属门打开，这群人的苦难终于画上了句号。

The so-called decontamination cycle the kids had to go through comprised of first taking photo headshot, which made most of the gang feel like a criminals going through police processing to the next part having to strip down to their undergarments for the worst part, to which they had to endure being sprayed and submerged in many kinds of disinfectant liquid both hot and cold at least three times in different stages before being dried off or more accurately blown with by giant wind fans in different directions of the room.  
所谓的去污程序包括首先拍摄大头照，这让大多数人都感觉像是罪犯在接受警方处理，然后是脱掉外衣，仅剩内衣的环节，这是最糟糕的部分，他们不得不忍受被喷洒和浸泡在各种消毒液中，冷热交替，至少在不同阶段重复三次，之后再用巨型风扇从房间的不同方向吹干。

The entire process was fifteenth minutes long but for everyone present, it felt an eternity, so when the kids were finally at the end and given back their clothing to wear they were happy that the doors opened up to the main facility.  
整个过程持续了十五分钟，但对在场的每个人来说，却仿佛过了一个世纪。当孩子们终于完成这一切，拿回衣服穿上时，他们欣喜地发现门已打开，通向了主设施。

"Dude, I feel both clean and very violated at the same time. Is that normal?" Toji wondered out loud while hugging himself as he shivered.  
"哥们，我既感觉干净又觉得被侵犯了，这正常吗？" 真嗣边说边抱着自己发抖。

"Is this going to be part of the facility when it officially opens?" Hikari wondered she fell to her knees on the floor, already afraid of the idea of bringing her family to this place when it opened if it would still have this decontamination cycle.  
"这会在设施正式开放时成为其中一部分吗？" 光担心地跪在地上，一想到如果这个地方开放后还有这种去污程序，她就不敢带家人来。

"I don't understand why we have to go through a decontamination thing anyway. I mean it's just fish and ones that are inside tanks..right?" Kensuke added in, questioning the logic behind this as he leaned on the wall and slowly dropped to the floor too.  
"我不明白我们为什么要经历这种去污过程。我是说，不就是鱼和鱼缸里的鱼吗？对吧？" 肯斯克靠在墙上，慢慢滑坐到地上，质疑这一逻辑。

"For once I agree with you, Aida," Asuka said as she focused on her little girl who was strangely silent upon coming out, still held by her hand by Rei who throughout the process didn't even flinch. She walking over along with Shinji, who shared the same worry that the decontamination cycle might have been a scary experience for the four-year-old. Kneeling to the child's level they saw that Aki was wide-eyed, unblinking and that her hair was wilder than ever.  
"这次我同意你的看法，Aida，" 明日香说道，她的注意力集中在刚出来时异常安静的小女儿身上，小家伙仍然被绫波牵着手，整个过程中绫波甚至没有动摇。她和真嗣一起走过去，两人都担心去污循环对四岁的孩子来说可能是一次可怕的经历。他们蹲下来看着小爱，发现她的眼睛睁得大大的，一动不动，头发比以往任何时候都要狂野。

"Ohh Schätzchen, are you ok?" Asuka asked her daughter and getting more worried when Aki didn't respond.  
"哦，宝贝，你还好吗？" 明日香问她的女儿，当小爱没有回应时，她更加担心了。

"Aki, honey, are you ok?" Shinji, too, asked his daughter and like his wife was getting worried about Aki's lack of response.  
"小爱，亲爱的，你还好吗？" 真嗣也问他的女儿，就像他的妻子一样，他对小爱缺乏回应感到担忧。

A second later Aki finally responded by blinking a few times and looking at her parents before her smile widened. "THAT WAS WICKED!" Aki cried out in excitement as she jumped up and down. "Let's do that again!"  
片刻后，Aki 终于眨了几下眼，看向她的父母，笑容更加灿烂。“太酷了！”Aki 兴奋地跳上跳下大喊，“我们再来一次吧！”

Aki's excited cry was shortly followed by the horrified Toji, Hikari and Kensuke. "NOOO!" the three friends cried out, not wanting to go through that again.  
Aki 的兴奋呼喊很快被 Toji、Hikari 和 Kensuke 的惊恐声打断。“不要啊！”三个朋友齐声喊道，他们可不想再经历一次。

Before Aki could ask why not, the main doors to the facility opened up diverting everyone's attention to the huge place filled with different marine life and all shapes and sizes.  
在 Aki 问出为什么之前，设施的主门打开了，吸引了所有人的注意力，眼前是一个巨大的场所，充满了各种海洋生物和各种形状大小的展品。

While everyone present was amazed at such a sight, Aki however couldn't contain her excitement upon seeing everything.  
在场的人无不对此景象感到惊叹，然而亚纪却按捺不住内心的兴奋，一见到这一切就激动不已。

"LOOK AT ALL THE FISHIES!" Aki cried out, breaking out of Rei's hand grip and speeding off towards the nearest fish tank and seeing the strange and exotic sea creatures before her.  
"看那些鱼儿！" 亚纪大喊一声，挣脱了丽的手，飞快地冲向最近的鱼缸，眼前是奇异而迷人的海洋生物。

Besides chuckling at the child's excitement, everyone was also in awe at seeing such marine life.  
除了对孩子的兴奋报以微笑，众人也对如此丰富的海洋生物感到敬畏。

"Wow, so all these creatures lived in the oceans before Second Impact?" Hikari voiced out. From what she could recall from TV shows, the internet and books she read in the past that many of these marine wildlife habitats became endangered when Second Impact happened.  
“哇，所以这些生物在第二次冲击之前都生活在海洋里吗？” 光问道。根据她从电视节目、互联网和过去阅读的书籍中回忆，许多这些海洋生物的栖息地在第二次冲击发生时变得濒危。

"Second Impact that was caused by.." Kensuke tried to voice his conspiracy theories, but was quickly cut off.  
“第二次冲击是由……” 真希试图说出他的阴谋论，但很快被打断了。

"Not now Kensuke!" Asuka, Shinji, Toji and Hikari voiced in sync, obviously not in the mood for Kensuke's conspiracies today. His response was to pout. When was he ever going to have a huge discussion about SEELE?  
“现在不是时候，真希！” 明日香、真嗣、渡和光异口同声地说，显然今天没心情听真希的阴谋论。他的回应是撅嘴。他什么时候才能有一次关于 SEELE 的深入讨论呢？

"Mama, Papa, Rei, look look at the fishies!" Aki cheerfully called out to them and once the three walked over to the girl they saw Aki was face pressing to the glass tanks around the room looking at some of the fish inside.  
"妈妈，爸爸，丽，快来看这些鱼！" 阿基兴高采烈地向他们喊道，当三人走近女孩时，他们看到阿基正脸贴着房间周围的玻璃水箱，盯着里面的鱼。

"Wow, I've never seen any of these fishies before!" Aki said as she saw a bunch of creatures that had shells on their backs.  
"哇，我从来没见过这些鱼！" 阿基看到一群背上有壳的生物时说道。

"Well Aki, they're called sea turtles and they're not fish but reptiles," Shinji told his daughter, trying slightly educate her that not all creatures in here are fish. And as he anticipated he saw Aki turn back to him in mild shock.  
"阿基，这些叫海龟，它们不是鱼，而是爬行动物，" 真嗣告诉他的女儿，试图稍微教育她，这里的生物并不都是鱼。正如他所预料的，他看到阿基带着轻微的震惊转过身来。

"Wha! Really!? I thought everything here was going to be fishies?" Aki said in confusion, her little young mind not knowing such a fact.  
"啊！真的吗！？我以为这里全是鱼呢？" 阿基困惑地说道，她幼小的心灵还不知道这样的事实。

"Not all creatures here are aquatic. Many mammals and reptiles can swim in the ocean, Aki," Rei told her little friend, for once not remaining silent.  
"并非所有这里的生物都是水生的。许多哺乳动物和爬行动物也能在海洋中游泳，阿基，" 丽告诉她的小朋友，这次没有保持沉默。

"Wow, I can't wait to tell everyone at kindergarten about this." Aki quickly got over such detail and continued to look around seeing more strange and unusual sea life on display.  
"哇，我等不及要告诉幼儿园的每个人这件事了。" 阿基很快忽略了这些细节，继续四处张望，看到了更多奇特和不寻常的海洋生物展示。

"Hey, what's this?" Aki voiced out seeing a creature that had eight long arms.  
"嘿，这是什么？" 阿基看到一个长着八条长臂的生物，不禁出声问道。

"Yo, it's an actual octopus." Toji came behind Aki and saw the eight-tentacled animal himself.  
"哟，真是个章鱼。" 托吉走到阿基身后，亲眼看到了这个八腕动物。

"Octopo?" Aki tried to say the name right. "Are they a fish or are they something else?"  
"章鱼？" 阿基试着正确发音。"它们是鱼类还是别的什么？"

"Well an octopus is…err…there are…" Toji tried to answer for Aki, but didn't know what exactly an octopus was himself.  
"嗯，章鱼是……呃……有……" 冬二试图替明回答，但他自己也不清楚章鱼究竟是什么。

"Octopus are cephalopods, a type of invertebrate," Kensuke explained, standing right next to them.  
"章鱼是头足纲动物，一种无脊椎动物，" 真希站在他们旁边解释道。

"Dude, how did you know that? Are you secretly a fan of fish too?" Toji looked at his friend.  
"伙计，你怎么知道的？你是不是也偷偷喜欢鱼类？" 冬二看着他的朋友。

"No, the information on the creatures here can be seen by pressing this button. See?" Kensuke told his friend and he pressed a button on the site of the tank which brought out a holographic display on the glass showing the information on the octopus in the said tank. The gang seeing this we're amazed by such advanced technology for such a place as an aquarium.  
“不，关于这些生物的信息可以通过按这个按钮查看。看？” 真希告诉他的朋友，并按下了水箱旁边的一个按钮，随即在玻璃上显示出关于水箱中章鱼的 holographic 信息。看到这一幕的伙伴们对这样一个水族馆能有如此先进的技术感到惊叹。

"Ok first a highly advanced decontamination room and now holographic display features on fish tanks? I'm starting to think this place is way too advanced and well-funded?" Asuka questioned.  
“首先是一个高度先进的消毒室，现在连鱼缸都有全息显示功能？我开始觉得这个地方太过先进且资金充足了吧？” 明日香质疑道。

"Again it makes me wonder how Kaji is connected to all this?" Shinji said also wondering again about this place and its connection to their resident spy.  
“这又让我好奇加治是如何与这一切联系起来的？” 真嗣也再次对这里及其与他们身边的间谍的联系感到疑惑。

Their questions were going to have to wait as they heard Aki gasp and the group saw the little girl and Rei further down. Catching up to them the gang saw what got Aki's attention was some sort of strange worm-like creature poking out of the ground.  
他们的疑问不得不暂时搁置，因为听到了 Aki 的惊呼，众人看到小女孩和 Rei 在更远的地方。追上他们后，团伙发现吸引 Aki 注意的，是一种奇怪的蠕虫状生物，正从地面探出头来。

"What the heck are these things?" Toji said, not having seen these things before. Even as he tapped the glass with his finger the creatures in the tank quickly retreated into the ground, an adaption that startled him slightly. Hikari not knowing herself press the button to display the holographic information.  
“这些到底是什么鬼东西？”Toji 说道，他之前从未见过这些东西。即使他用手指轻敲玻璃，水箱里的生物也迅速退回地面，这种适应性让他略感惊讶。Hikari 自己也不清楚，便按下按钮显示全息信息。

"Well, it's said here that these are spotted garden eel which is a heteroconger belonging to the family of Congridae, whatever that is," Hikari finished reading the description.  
“嗯，这里说这些是有斑点的花园鳗，属于异康吉鳗科的异康吉鳗属，管它是什么呢，”Hikari 读完了描述。

"Hey, they're coming back out," Aki chimed in as she saw the eels in the tank slowly starting to come out from the ground. After having been spooked by Toji tapping before however, they didn't come out fully upon seeing the humans still near them. Aki thought for a second before backing away slightly from the glass, raising her arms about her head and starting to move her body weirdly.  
"嘿，它们又出来了，" 阿基看到水箱里的鳗鱼慢慢地从地下钻出来时说道。虽然之前被东二敲打吓到过，但看到人类还在附近，它们并没有完全出来。阿基想了一会儿，然后稍微后退离开玻璃，举起双臂在头顶，开始奇怪地扭动身体。

Seeing this strange action from their daughter, Asuka and Shinji looked at each other before the redheaded mother decided to ask. "Err Schätzchen what exactly are you doing?"  
看到女儿这奇怪的动作，明日香和真嗣互相对视，红发的母亲决定问一问。"呃，宝贝，你到底在做什么？"

"I'm now a spotted eel, Mama, so that the eels will not be afraid," Aki explained as she continued her spotted eel impression. Her parents started to chuckle at the display, with Toji, Hikari, and Kensuke joining in after with Rei showing a smile.  
"我现在是斑点鳗鱼，妈妈，这样鳗鱼就不会害怕了，" 阿基解释道，继续她的斑点鳗鱼模仿。她的父母开始轻笑，东二、光和健介也跟着笑了起来，丽则露出了微笑。

After waiting for Aki to finish bringing out the spotted eels, which proved to be longer than expected (prompting Aki to force everyone present to mimic her eel impression which after such an embarrassing act finally got the eels out of hiding), they were able to move on, when once again something caught Aki's eye.  
在等待 Aki 把斑点鳗鱼全部拿出来，这个过程比预期的要长（Aki 还强迫在场每个人模仿她的鳗鱼印象，经过这么尴尬的表演后，鳗鱼终于不再躲藏），他们才能继续前进，这时 Aki 的目光又被某样东西吸引。

"Ooh what are these, they look like little tiny horses!" Aki said with wonder and excitement as she got to the tank.  
“哦，这些是什么，看起来像小马驹！”Aki 带着惊奇和兴奋说道，她走到了水族箱前。

"Ooh, it's seahorses," Hikari said as she smiled upon seeing the creatures herself.  
“哦，是海马，”Hikari 笑着说，她自己也看到了这些生物。

"Seahorses? So horsies can swim too?" Aki questioned.  
"海马？所以马儿也会游泳吗？" 阿基问道。

"No honey, seashores are different from regular horses. They just share similar names because of how they look," Shinji explained to his daughter as she went to press the button showing the information. "Look, it saids here that seahorses are in fact fish."  
"不，亲爱的，海马和普通马不一样。它们只是因为外形相似而共享了类似的名字，" 真嗣向女儿解释道，她走过去按下了显示信息的按钮。"看，这里写着海马实际上是鱼类。"

"Ooh..ok!" Aki quickly got over such a fact and moved on before everyone else, Rei following close behind.  
"哦...好吧！" 阿基迅速接受了这一事实，继续前行，其他人还没跟上，丽紧随其后。

"Hey here's an interesting fact. It saids here that the male seahorse is the one that carries the eggs. At least one male species on this planet doesn't mind doing the hard part of reproduction," Asuka said while giving the males of their group a stink eye. Shinji at least gave an apologetic look, remembering how the pregnancy put a strain on Asuka physically.  
"嘿，这里有个有趣的事实。上面说雄性海马是携带卵子的那一方。至少在这个星球上，有一种雄性物种不介意承担繁衍的辛苦部分，" 明日香说着，向他们小组的男性成员投去不满的目光。至少真嗣露出了歉意的表情，记得怀孕对明日香身体造成的压力。

"Wait Asuka, was being pregnant so hard?" Hikari whispered to her friend as everyone was moving along again.  
"等等，明日香，怀孕真的那么难吗？" 当大家再次移动时，光悄悄问她的朋友。

"Let me just say, Hikari, that being pregnant for months isn't great by any means especially when you have to deal with mood swings, weight gain, physical cramps, pains, sleepless nights and cravings that make you want to eat things you never even consider putting in your mouth plus the fact that none of my good clothes would fit anymore. Also, I and Shinji got really lucky that I didn't miscarriage because of my age at the time," Asuka bluntly explained to her friend.  
"让我告诉你，光，连续几个月怀孕绝不是什么好事，尤其是当你得应付情绪波动、体重增加、身体痉挛、疼痛、失眠的夜晚和让你想吃那些你从未考虑过放进嘴里的食物的渴望，再加上我那些好衣服都穿不下了。而且，我和真嗣真的很幸运，我没有因为当时的年龄而流产，" 明日香直白地向她的朋友解释道。

She didn't want to explain this to her friend but there was part of her wanting to make sure that Hikari knew of the repercussions of getting pregnant, especially if she decided to go all the way with Toji before they were truly ready. A thought that Asuka didn't want to imagine otherwise she would start gagging.  
她不想向朋友解释这一切，但内心的一部分却希望确保光知道怀孕的后果，尤其是如果她在和真嗣真正准备好之前就决定走到底。这个念头让明日香不愿去想象，否则她可能会开始作呕。

"Re..really? Is it all that bad?" Hikari asked somewhat looking disappointed maybe her initially having the belief that pregnancy was a wonderful thing.  
“真、真的吗？有那么糟糕吗？”光有些失望地问，或许她最初认为怀孕是一件美妙的事情。

"Oh, don't get me wrong it was a pain most of the time and I certainly do without most of the things I mentioned. But through all that, it gave me the best thing in the world to me," Asuka said as she fondly watched her daughter running around looking at different tanks from afar. "And maybe in the future if I and Shinji decide on having another child, I would go through it all again without hesitation," Asuka finished saying to her friend.  
“哦，别误会，大部分时间确实很痛苦，我当然希望不必经历我提到的那些事。但尽管如此，它给了我世界上最珍贵的东西。”明日香深情地看着女儿在远处跑来跑去，观察着不同的坦克。“也许将来如果我和真嗣决定再要一个孩子，我会毫不犹豫地再次经历这一切。”明日香对朋友说道。

"Oh wow, Asuka," Hikari said in awe of her friend and remembered that Asuka was mentally older and more mature than she looked. "So I guess being pregnant is worth it then after all."  
"哦哇，明日香，" 光惊叹于她的朋友，并记起明日香在心智上比外表看起来要成熟得多。"所以我想怀孕终究还是值得的。"

"Hey, just because I told you all this doesn't mean you can start doing.. stuff with monkey boy." Asuka said in clear disgust with Hikari soon blushing at many thoughts of "that" with Toji. "Also don't give him any ideas or he might exhibit himself again," Asuka finished saying, remembering her first meeting with the jock as she walked ahead to catch up.  
"嘿，就算我告诉了你这些，也不代表你可以开始和那个猴子男孩做...那种事。" 明日香带着明显的厌恶说道，光的脸颊很快因想起与真治的种种而泛红。"还有，别给他任何念头，否则他可能又会展示自己，" 明日香说完，回忆起第一次遇见那个运动员的情景，快步向前追赶。"

"O..ok." Hikari shyly said, still daydreaming of those kinds of thoughts of her and Toji before her brain finally registered the last thing Asuka said. "Hey…Hey Asuka! What do you mean exhibit it again!?"  
"好...好吧。" 光羞涩地说，仍在幻想她与真治的那些念头，直到她的大脑终于处理了明日香最后说的话。"嘿…嘿明日香！你说的'再次展示'是什么意思！？"

x-x-x-x-x

While everyone was enjoying themselves, especially Aki, Rei's mind had been somewhat distracted. Upon arriving here and entering the facility she felt a strange sense of familiarity and it took her a moment to realise why.  
尽管大家都在尽情享受，尤其是 Aki，Rei 的心思却有些飘忽。来到这里并进入设施后，她感到一种莫名的熟悉感，过了一会儿才意识到原因。

This place reminded her of her birthplace or more accurately the place where she was created, the dummy plug plant. A place where she routinely place herself in a tank of LCL where she would have her brain, her mind and soul copied and store away like a backup in case she would die allowing Gendo Ikari to create a new Rei to replace the previous one.  
这个地方让她想起了她的出生地，或者更确切地说，是她被创造的地方——模拟插入栓工厂。在那里，她定期将自己置于 LCL 溶液中，复制她的大脑、思想和灵魂，像备份一样储存起来，以防她死去，让 Gendo Ikari 能制造一个新的 Rei 来取代之前的。

So as she stared at a fish tank before her, she blinked and gasped in horror at what she saw. She was once again back in the dummy plug plant, facing the LCL tank but the tank was not the same orange colour but of crimson red, filled with blood, blood that came from the decaying and broken flesh of the soulless copies of herself.  
因此，当她凝视着眼前的鱼缸时，她眨了眨眼，惊恐地倒吸一口气。她再次回到了模拟插入栓工厂，面对着 LCL 溶液罐，但罐子不再是橙色，而是猩红色，充满了血液，这些血液来自那些没有灵魂的自己复制体的腐烂和破碎的肉体。

Just as Rei backed away slowly from the glass, she heard it and it made her freeze. The sound was giggling, giggling that she knew came from the soulless clones in the tank and as Rei looked closer she saw that from the back of the tank were near endless copies of herself moving towards the tank glass. The giggling they made was deafening the room and once the horde of decaying Reis reached the glass, it cracked under the weight and pressure of the many Rei clones that collided on it, the blood began to spill between the cracks and in mere moments the glass would break and Rei wanted to run but she couldn't move, she was afraid.  
就在丽正慢慢从玻璃前退开时，她听到了那个声音，那让她瞬间僵住。那是咯咯的笑声，她知道这笑声来自水箱中那些没有灵魂的克隆体。当丽更仔细地看去，她发现从水箱后方涌出了近乎无穷无尽的自己的复制品，正向着玻璃移动。她们的笑声震耳欲聋，当这一大群腐烂的丽们撞上玻璃时，玻璃在众多克隆体的重量和压力下裂开了，血液开始从裂缝中渗出，转眼间玻璃就要破碎，丽想逃跑却动弹不得，她害怕极了。

"Rei." A voice called out  
“丽。”一个声音呼唤道

"Rei." The voice called out again but much louder.  
“丽。”那个声音再次呼唤，这次更加响亮。

"Rei!" The voice shouted out and Rei knew that voice, it was her friend Aki and as soon as she realised that she was once again back at the aquarium facility still facing the fish tank but now she noticed her little friend was beside her, grabbing her skirt in both of hers and was worried about her.  
"丽！" 那声音喊道，丽立刻认出了那是她的朋友秋的声音。她意识到自己又一次回到了水族馆设施，依旧面对着鱼缸，但现在她注意到她的小朋友正站在她身边，双手抓着她的裙子，担心地看着她。

"Rei, are you ok?" Aki asked her friend, worried about her as Rei was just staring into the tank and was shaking before she got to her.  
"丽，你还好吗？" 秋问她的朋友，担心地看着丽只是盯着鱼缸，身体还在颤抖。

"…yes…yes, I'm fine," Rei tried to sound reassuring to her friend but her voice shook with a bit of uncertainty to it.  
"…是的…是的，我没事，" 丽试图让自己的声音听起来令人安心，但她的声音中带着一丝不确定的颤抖。

"Are you sure?" Aki asked again somewhat knowing that something was bothering her friend. "You look sad."  
"你确定吗？" 亚纪再次问道，隐约感觉到朋友有些困扰。"你看起来很悲伤。"

Rei didn't say anything for a moment, contemplating whether or not to say anything to her young friend but the choice was made when Aki grabbed her hand to comfort her.  
零没有立即回答，她在考虑是否要对这位年轻的朋友吐露心声，但当亚纪握住她的手以示安慰时，她做出了决定。

"It's just that this place reminds me of where I was..born and what I will always be," Rei explained to her friend, making it very vague enough to not tell Aki the whole truth.  
"只是这个地方让我想起了我出生的地方，以及我永远的身份，" 零向她的朋友解释道，说得足够含糊，以免向亚纪透露全部真相。

Aki didn't say anything for a second, obviously confused at Rei's answer. "Wait…you were a fishy?" came the four-year-old's reply.  
Aki 一时没说话，显然对 Rei 的回答感到困惑。“等等……你曾经是条小鱼？”四岁的小家伙回应道。

Rei looked down at her friend, giving the little girl a confused blinking stare for a moment before she did something even she didn't expect from herself, she smiled which evolved next into a light chuckle.  
Rei 低头看着她的朋友，对小女孩眨了眨眼，露出困惑的表情，随后她做了连自己都没想到的事——她笑了，接着演变成一阵轻笑。

"Rei?" Aki was again confused by Rei's sudden change in mood and chuckling.  
“Rei？”Aki 再次被 Rei 突如其来的情绪变化和笑声弄糊涂了。

"It's nothing, come." Rei held firmly to Aki's hand as they move along.  
"没什么，来吧。" 丽紧紧握住明的手，一起前行。

Unknown to the two, Shinji had been watching them from a slight distance and overheard Rei's short conversation. He felt guilty having brought her along, not realising that such a place would remind her of her "birth" place but luckily Aki had given Rei the comfort she needed.  
两人并不知道，真嗣从稍远的地方观察着他们，无意中听到了丽的简短对话。他感到内疚，带她来这里，没想到这个地方会让她想起她的"出生地"，但幸运的是，明给了丽所需的安慰。

He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to see that it was Asuka. "Hey, is everything alright?" Asuka asked, probably seeing that something was bothering her Baka.  
他感到有人拍了拍他的肩膀，转身一看是明日香。"嘿，一切都好吗？" 明日香问道，可能看出她的笨蛋有些心事。

Shinji shook his head. "Nah, everything's ok. Aki took care of it without knowing to,"Shinji explained as he gestured towards Aki and Rei who were moving along.  
真嗣摇了摇头。“没事，一切都没问题。Aki 在不知情的情况下处理好了，”真嗣解释道，同时指向正在移动的 Aki 和丽。

"Ah, I see." Asuka smiled as she leaned her head on Shinji's shoulder, already figuring out what Aki had done. "She is just like you, having this connection with Rei."  
“啊，我明白了。”明日香微笑着将头靠在真嗣的肩膀上，已经猜到了 Aki 做了什么。“她就像你一样，与丽有着这种联系。”

Shinji nodded in agreement. "Yeah, but back then I couldn't get much more than awkward conversations with her. Aki managed to do more because she is bold and brave just like you."  
真嗣点头表示同意。“是啊，但那时候我和丽之间只能进行一些尴尬的对话。Aki 能做到更多，因为她和你一样大胆勇敢。”

Asuka blushed slightly at that. Well, two could play this game. "Well, she has your kindness and compassion," Asuka fired her compliments and it worked, given that Shinji was now slightly blushing too.  
听到这话，明日香微微脸红。好吧，两个人都能玩这个游戏。“好吧，她有你的善良和同情心，”明日香回敬了一句赞美，效果立竿见影，因为真嗣现在也微微脸红了。

Asuka lifted her head off Shinji's shoulder, now looking at him and with him looking at her too, they started moving in for a kiss.  
明日香从真嗣的肩膀上抬起头，现在两人对视着，他们开始靠近，准备接吻。

"Yo Married couple! Either get a room or hurry up, you're falling behind!" Toji's voice echoed throughout the hallway which caused the two lovers to blush more in embarrassment.  
“哟，新婚夫妇！要么找个房间，要么快点，你们落后了！”东治的声音在走廊里回荡，这让两位恋人更加尴尬地脸红了。

"Damn that monkey boy, ruining the moment," Asuka grumbled.  
“该死的猴子男孩，毁了这一刻。” 明日香咕哝着。

"Mama, Papa! Come quick, come quick!" Aki called out to her parents. Something had gotten her attention on the next area.  
“妈妈，爸爸！快来，快来！” 阿基向她的父母喊道。有什么东西引起了她的注意。

Upon reaching the next area Asuka and Shinji saw a large group of familiar-looking birds.  
到达下一个区域后，明日香和真嗣看到了一大群看起来很眼熟的鸟。

"PenPen! Look it's a lot of you!" Aki called out to their penguin. The said penguin now walked over to the glass exhibit separating the group from a large number of penguins.  
“PenPen！看，好多你！”Aki 向他们的企鹅喊道。那只企鹅现在走到了玻璃展柜前，隔开了他们和一大群企鹅。

Just as PenPen got to the glass, his presence was noticed by the other penguins, who one after the other stopped and stared at the unfamiliar penguin. For a moment neither PenPen nor the other penguins did anything till finally, PenPen took what looked like a deep breath.  
就在 PenPen 到达玻璃前时，他的存在引起了其他企鹅的注意，它们一个接一个地停下来，盯着这只陌生的企鹅。一时间，PenPen 和其他企鹅都没有任何动作，直到最后，PenPen 似乎深吸了一口气。

"WARK!" PenPen cried out startling everyone, humans and penguins alike.  
“哇克！”PenPen 突然大叫起来，吓到了所有人，包括人类和企鹅。

"Wark, wark, wark, wark, wark, wark, wark!" PenPen continued to voice out as he also started moving back and forth along the glass. The penguins all followed his every move as well as listening to whatever he was saying.  
"哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克！" 企鹅 PenPen 继续发出声音，同时开始在玻璃前后来回移动。其他企鹅们也紧随其后，仔细聆听他所说的每一句话。

"Wark, wark, wark, wark, wark, wark, WARK, WARK, WAAARRRKK!" PenPen finally finished saying…whatever he was saying, even doing standing attention with his head held high.  
"哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克，哇克！" PenPen 终于说完了…无论他说了什么，甚至站得笔直，昂首挺胸。

For a moment all the other penguins simply blinked and even looked at each other before surprisingly they started squeaking loudly as if they were cheering at what PenPen just said to them.  
有那么一会儿，其他企鹅只是眨了眨眼，甚至互相看了看，然后出乎意料地开始大声尖叫，仿佛在为 PenPen 刚刚对他们说的话欢呼。

The humans on the other hand were just confused about what exactly just happened.  
另一方面，人类们只是对刚刚发生的事情感到困惑。

"Err…can somebody tell me what the heck just happened?" Toji asked out loud, hoping anyone will shed some light on this.  
"呃……有人能告诉我刚才到底发生了什么吗？" 真嗣大声问道，希望有人能解释一下。

"I'm not a hundred per cent sure but I think PenPen might have just become their king," Kensuke said and every looking back at the scene and it did kinda seem like it.  
"我不敢百分百确定，但我觉得 PenPen 可能刚刚成为了他们的国王，" 健介说道，大家回头看向那一幕，确实有点像那么回事。

"Yeah! King PenPen!" Aki cheered, happy for her penguin friend, even hugging the penguin much to his irritation.  
“耶！国王企鹅！”阿基欢呼道，为她的企鹅朋友感到高兴，甚至拥抱了企鹅，尽管这让企鹅感到恼火。

x-x-x-x-x-x

After a few more hours of going through different sections of the facility and seeing even more marine life creatures, especially larger ones like dolphins, sharks, whales, etc the gang had already seen everything the place had to offer. Aki, however, wanted to see all the creatures again but she was denied due to not only was everyone tired from the walking but the fact that it was lunchtime.  
又过了几个小时，他们穿梭于设施的不同区域，见到了更多海洋生物，尤其是像海豚、鲨鱼、鲸鱼这样的大型生物。一行人已经看遍了这里的所有展品。然而，阿基还想再看一遍所有生物，但她的请求被拒绝了，不仅因为大家都走累了，还因为午餐时间到了。

So the group eventually found the rest area where they encountered other visitors. The place looked like it was going to have a few gift shops, restaurants and sitting area for people and a view of the ocean bay outside. Unfortunately, none of the first two was officially open yet as they were still under construction.  
于是，这群人最终找到了休息区，那里已经有其他游客。这个地方看起来会有几家礼品店、餐厅和供人休息的区域，还能看到外面的海湾景色。遗憾的是，前两者都尚未正式开放，因为还在建设中。

After having finished eating the gang now had to do the gruelling task of filling out the survey for this place.  
吃完饭后，这群人现在不得不完成一项艰巨的任务——填写这家店的调查问卷。

"Ah man this sucks, couldn't they have just given us this as an attachment to an email for us to do this later?" Toji grumbled as he filled out another survey page.  
“啊，真是烦人，他们就不能直接把这问卷作为附件发到我们邮箱里，让我们晚点再填吗？” 真嗣一边填写着另一页问卷，一边抱怨道。

"Possibly, though I think they anticipated that people would just don't want to fill it in so they make us do it now," Kensuke said.  
“可能吧，不过我觉得他们预料到大家会懒得填，所以才让我们现在就做，” 健介说道。

"They must want the tourism if they making us fill in all these questionnaires then," Hikari added in as she diligently kept writing and going through each question on the page.  
"他们要是想吸引游客，才会让我们填这么多问卷吧，" 光继续说道，她认真地逐题填写着页面上的问题。

"Well glad that they at least had the decency to give Aki a kid-friendly survey instead of the one we got," Shinji said as he took a moment to glance at his daughter doing a much easier and tinier questionnaire survey with the help of Rei (who was of course already done with hers) which had fewer written answers and a lot more rate your experience from numbers one to ten with the first being the lowest and the latter being the highest.  
"至少他们还有点良心，给阿基准备了一份儿童友好的调查问卷，而不是我们这份，" 真嗣说着，瞥了一眼女儿在丽的帮助下做着一份简单得多的问卷调查，这份问卷答案更少，更多的是让你从一到十评价你的体验，一代表最低，十代表最高。

"And I liked all the fishies including the ones that weren't fishies too," Aki happily dictated her answer to Rei.  
"我喜欢所有的鱼，包括那些不是鱼的，" 阿基开心地向丽口述她的答案。

"Just to be clear, we're all agreeing to write down that the worst thing this place has was that decontamination cycle and that it's completely pointless for this place." Asuka voiced out to everyone with everyone nodding firmly in agreement, minus Aki and Rei.  
“明确一下，我们都同意写下这个地方最糟糕的是那个除污循环，而且它对这里完全没用。”明日香向大家说道，除了真希和绫波，所有人都坚定地点头同意。

"Also I didn't like that I couldn't touch or swim along with the fishies." Aki continued saying as Rei diligently wrote it down.  
“还有，我不喜欢不能触摸或与鱼儿一起游泳。”真希继续说道，绫波则认真地记录下来。

Out of nowhere, an alarm sounded and echoed throughout the entire facility, startling everyone.  
突然间，警报声响起，响彻整个设施，让所有人都吓了一跳。

"Wha..what going on!?" Shinji cried out. Fortunately, he got his answer when the head researcher Chisato Ushio burst into the rest area, somewhat relieved that everyone from each group is present in one place.  
"怎...怎么回事！？" 真嗣惊呼道。幸运的是，他很快得到了答案，首席研究员如月千里冲进了休息区，有些庆幸每个小组的成员都聚集在这里。

"Ok everyone I want everyone to not be alarmed! We're just experiencing some…er…technical difficulties, so just remain calm and stay here till I sort out what the situation is!" Miss Ushio told the visitors before running out of the area and even surprisingly shut and locked the behind her.  
"好了，大家请不要惊慌！我们只是遇到了一些……呃……技术上的困难，所以请保持冷静，待在这里直到我弄清楚情况！" 如月老师向访客们解释后，匆匆离开了区域，甚至出乎意料地关上门并上了锁。

"Did she just leave us locked in here!?" Hikari said in disbelief.  
"她就这样把我们锁在这里了！？" 光子难以置信地说道。

Before anyone could comment another alarm with a voice message rang throughout the place.  
还没等任何人发表意见，另一个带有语音信息的警报声响彻整个地方。

"WARNING, WARNING, CODE 19: ASSETS OUT OF CONTAINMENT. WARNING, WARNING, CODE 19: ASSETS OUT OF CONTAINMENT."  
"警告，警告，代码 19：资产脱离控制。警告，警告，代码 19：资产脱离控制。"

"Assets out of containment?" Shinji wondered and before anyone could comment there was a loud bang on the entrance door, which kept repeating.  
"资产脱离控制？" 真嗣疑惑道，还没等任何人发表意见，入口处就传来了一阵响亮的撞击声，且不断重复。

"What is that!? Kensuke asked worryingly but no one answered though Shinji, Asuka and Rei stepped in front of Aki just in case.  
"那是什么！？" 真希担心地问，但没有人回答，尽管真嗣、明日香和丽还是站到了亚纪前面以防万一。

The banging on the door suddenly stopped and for a moment nothing happened till the door flung open and to everyone's amazement it was a horde of penguins that either rushed or they skidded in on their bellies.  
敲门声突然停止了，一时间什么也没发生，直到门猛地被撞开，令所有人惊愕的是，一群企鹅或是疾跑或是滑行着冲了进来。

"Wait…the penguins?" Toji said in confusion as the small birds rushed past the group. He had been expecting something more dangerous coming through those doors.  
"等等……企鹅？" 冬二困惑地说，看着这些小鸟从他们身边冲过。他原本以为会有更危险的东西从那扇门里出来。

"So it was these little guys that are causing all the fuss?" Hikari wondered as she slightly jumped when a baby penguin went under and through her long skirt.  
"原来就是这些小家伙闹得沸沸扬扬？" 光看着一只小企鹅从她长裙下钻过，不禁微微跳了起来。

"Hehe look that one's trying to eat a banana whole." Aki laughed at one of the said penguins that was struggling to eat a peeled banana whole, as well as enjoying the situation going on around them.  
"呵呵，看那只正试图一口吞下整个香蕉。" 秋笑看着其中一只企鹅挣扎着吃掉剥了皮的香蕉，同时也享受着周围的情景。

"WARK!" A familiar sound echoed to the group and they saw that PenPen was at the far end of the room and pushed the emergency exit door that lead to the outside world. He gestured to his brethren to move out and they all quickly followed suit. Once all of them were outside, PenPen shut the emergency exit door, just in time as two security guards of this facility came rushing into the room, both looking like they'd been through the wringer.  
"哇克！" 一个熟悉的声音在众人耳边响起，他们看到 PenPen 在房间的另一头推开了通往外界的紧急出口门。他示意同伴们跟上，大家迅速鱼贯而出。待所有企鹅都到了外面，PenPen 及时关上了紧急出口门，正好两名安保人员冲进房间，看起来都像是经历了一场风波。

"STOP THOSE PENGUINS!" one of the guards shouted but before they had the charge forward, they had stepped on and slipped on a banana peel that was on the floor and tripped comically while also accidentally making his partner trip.  
“快拦住那些企鹅！”一名守卫大喊道，但还没等他们冲上前，就踩到了地板上的香蕉皮，滑稽地摔倒了，还不小心让他的同伴也跟着摔了一跤。

While the guards were trying to pick themselves up, the gang and all the other visitors went to the open window just in time to see all the escaped penguins start diving off the water shore.  
当守卫们挣扎着起身时，团伙和其他游客们赶到了敞开的窗户前，正好看到所有逃脱的企鹅开始从水岸边跳入水中。

Everyone could only stare in shock at what just happened. The whole facility's entire penguin exhibit just managed to escape with little resistance. The gang however all looked at their resident penguin who had joined them in looking at his brethren being freed.  
所有人都震惊地盯着眼前发生的一切。整个设施的企鹅展区就这样几乎毫无阻力地逃脱了。然而，团伙成员们都看向了他们身边的企鹅，它也加入了他们，注视着它的同伴们获得自由。

Shinji kneeled to PenPen's level, making sure the penguin was now focusing on him. "PenPen…did you do all this?" Shinji asked his feathered friend, almost afraid to do so. Sure, he was aware that PenPen was more intelligent than any animal he knew, but to cripple this place's entire security and organise a prison escape for his penguin friends, pack or subjects? It just wasn't possible right!?  
真嗣跪到与 PenPen 同一高度，确保这只企鹅现在正专注地看着他。“PenPen…这些都是你做的吗？”真嗣向他的羽毛朋友问道，几乎有些害怕得到答案。当然，他知道 PenPen 比他所知的任何动物都要聪明，但要瘫痪这个地方的整个安保系统，并为他的企鹅朋友们——无论是群体还是臣民——策划一场越狱？这怎么可能，对吧？

PenPen's only response to Shinji's question was giving him a wink and nothing else.  
PenPen 对真嗣的问题唯一的回应是向他眨了眨眼，再无其他。

Shinji wasn't the only one who saw that wink from the penguin, Asuka saw it too and giving Shinji a look, they silently agreed that it was now time to get out of here before both the staff and security realised that their little bird friend had caused all this trouble.  
看到那只企鹅眨眼的并不只有真嗣一人，明日香也看到了，她向真嗣使了个眼色，两人无声地达成共识：现在是时候离开这里了，以免工作人员和安保人员意识到他们的小鸟朋友造成了这一切麻烦。

For those wondering this chapter is a nod to the actual aquarium scene in the rebuild 2.0 movie, which is one of the few good things that came out of those movies.  
对于那些好奇的人来说，这个chapter是对《新世纪福音战士剧场版：序》（Rebuild 2.0）中实际的水族馆场景的致敬，那是这几部电影中为数不多的亮点之一。

Also the idea of PenPen becoming the king/alpha of the penguins in the aquarium is kinda based on the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes with a touch of Mission Impossible to explain how PenPen had managed to cripple a research facility security systems and staff lol.  
另外，PenPen 成为水族馆企鹅之王/首领的想法，有点基于电影《猩球崛起》，再加上一点《碟中谍》的元素，来解释 PenPen 是如何设法瘫痪了一个研究设施的安全系统和工作人员的，哈哈。

### Chapter 13 Pet Shop

"So honey, how was your day at kindergarten?" Shinji asked his daughter as he and Asuka held on to her little hands as they continued their long walk home.  
“亲爱的，今天在幼儿园过得怎么样？”真嗣问他的女儿，他和明日香握着她的小手，继续他们漫长的回家路。

"Yeah, did you have fun today Schätzchen?" Asuka inquired, wanting to know if Aki had fun or even may have learned something new and exciting.  
“是啊，你今天玩得开心吗，宝贝？” 明日香问道，想知道阿基是否玩得开心，甚至可能学到了一些新奇的东西。

Aki didn't disappoint them as she was more than ready to say what was on her mind. "Yeah, I did, Mama, Papa! Today I drew a new picture of everyone in the class, I played in the sandbox where I tried to make a pyramid as Rei does and…oh I and everyone played the game Ducky Goose though Jun-kun kinda kept forgetting to say goose when it was his turn."  
阿基没有让他们失望，她迫不及待地想要说出自己的想法。“嗯，我玩得很开心，妈妈，爸爸！今天我画了我们班每个人的新画，我在沙池里玩，试着像丽那样堆一个金字塔，还有……哦，我和大家一起玩了鸭子鹅游戏，不过淳君有点老忘记轮到他时要说鹅。”

Shinji and Asuka chuckled at their daughter's excitement but never lost their proud smiles. They were happy that Aki was fitting in well at Kindergarten and making friends her age.  
真嗣和明日香被女儿的兴奋逗笑了，但始终保持着自豪的微笑。他们很高兴阿基在幼儿园适应得很好，交到了同龄的朋友。

Before either of them could comment on anything, Aki gasped as her head was turned to the side like she was looking at something before she squealed loudly in excitement, an action which slightly scared both her parents.  
在他们俩能对任何事情发表评论之前，Aki 突然倒抽一口气，头转向一边，仿佛在看什么东西，然后兴奋地尖叫起来，这一举动稍微吓到了她的父母。

"A-Aki, what's wrong?" Shinji asked his daughter wondering what got her excited now.  
“A-Aki，怎么了？”真嗣问他的女儿，想知道是什么让她如此兴奋。

"Look! Look! LOOK!" Aki simply said as she let go of her parent's hands and started pointing at the other side of the road as she hopped up and down.  
“看！看！快看！”Aki 简单地说着，松开了父母的手，开始指着马路对面，一边跳一边喊。

Both parents looked in the direction where Aki was pointing and at first, didn't notice anything significant, just a few shops and apartments but eventually, they saw what had caught Aki's attention. It was indeed a shop, a new one if the sign which said in big words "grand opening" out front was any indication. But it was the shop's nature that made Asuka and Shinji starting to sweat a bit.  
两位家长顺着 Aki 所指的方向看去，起初并未发现什么特别之处，只是几家商店和公寓，但最终，他们看到了吸引 Aki 注意的东西。确实是一家店铺，如果门前写着“盛大开业”的大字招牌能说明什么的话，那它显然是新开的。但让 Asuka 和 Shinji 开始冒汗的，是这家店的性质。

It was a pet shop and from the open windows, they could see many cats, dogs and a few bird cages on display. As if they could see them, the cute animals were all but crying out to them for attention.  
这是一家宠物店，透过敞开的窗户，他们可以看到许多猫、狗以及几笼鸟在展示。仿佛能看见他们似的，这些可爱的动物们几乎都在向他们呼唤着关注。

It seemly was too much for Aki to bear and she slipped out of her parent's grasp and started to run towards the shop, but luckily both Shinji and Asuka grabbed her again before she could carelessly run into the semi-busy road. Aki was about to complain to her parents but she quickly shrank underneath their scolding look.  
Aki 似乎无法忍受，她从父母的掌握中溜走，开始向店铺跑去，但幸运的是，Shinji 和 Asuka 在她不小心冲进半繁忙的马路之前再次抓住了她。Aki 正要向父母抱怨，但她很快在他们责备的眼神下缩了回去。

"Aki! How many times have we told you about running into the road?" Asuka told off her daughter.  
"阿基！我们跟你说过多少次了，不要跑到马路上去？" 明日香训斥着她的女儿。

"Yeah, honey. What have we told you about that?" Shinji said in a stern tone.  
"是啊，宝贝。我们跟你说过什么来着？" 真嗣用严厉的语气说道。

"Sigh…don't run in the road, look for a traffic crossing and stop, look and above all else wait for the green light," Aki said, clearly repeating what she had been told numerous times on how to be safe while near the now busy modern-day road.  
"唉……不要在马路上跑，要找人行横道，停下来，看看两边，最重要的是等绿灯亮了再走，" 阿基说，显然是在重复她已经被多次教导的关于如何在如今繁忙的现代道路旁保持安全的知识。

"That's right honey. Always remember that, ok?" Shinji told Aki like the protective father that he was.  
"没错，亲爱的。永远记住这一点，好吗？" 真嗣像一个保护性的父亲一样对亚纪说道。

After finding a nearby crosswalk and making sure Aki did follow the instructions of crossing the road they all stood in front of the new pet store.  
在找到附近的斑马线并确保亚纪确实遵循了过马路的指示后，他们一起站在了新宠物店前。

"Awww, look at all the kitties! Look at the puppies! Ah, look at all the little birdies too!" Aki excitedly cried out as she all but planted her face against the open glass of the store. Breaking her view away from the animals, Aki turned back to her Mama and Papa. "Can we look inside Mama, Papa?"  
"哇，看那些小猫咪！还有小狗！啊，看那些小鸟儿！" 亚纪兴奋地喊道，几乎把脸贴在了商店的玻璃上。她从动物们身上移开视线，转头看向妈妈和爸爸。"妈妈，爸爸，我们可以进去看看吗？"

Both Shinji and Asuka knew that once they went inside the store, it was going to be a big battle of wills, knowing that once their little rascal saw a special animal in there, she would want it as a pet. Luckily for them, they had a good excuse this time around.  
无论是真嗣还是明日香都清楚，一旦他们走进那家店，一场意志的较量在所难免，因为他们的小捣蛋鬼一旦看到里面有特别的动物，肯定会想要把它当作宠物。幸运的是，这次他们有个不错的借口。

"We can go inside and look, but _only_ look around, ok honey?" Shinji firmly told Aki who pouted but nodded anyway.  
“我们可以进去看看，但只能看看，好吗，宝贝？”真嗣坚定地告诉爱子，她虽然撅着嘴，但还是点了点头。

"That's right Schätzchen, we can't have any pets yet due to our living situation at the moment," Asuka added, clearly on the same page as Shinji. It wasn't a complete lie anyway as them living with Misato in her already cramped apartment didn't allow them to abuse it by bringing in another housemate into it. Even when they would finally settle the moving situation with the Yamaderas, it would be a bit more time to even consider letting Aki be responsible for a pet.  
“没错，小宝贝，我们现在还不能养宠物，因为居住环境不允许，”明日香补充道，显然和真嗣想法一致。这也不算完全撒谎，毕竟他们和美里住在她那已经很拥挤的公寓里，实在不适合再添一个室友。即便他们最终解决了搬家问题，和山代家安顿下来，也要再过一段时间才能考虑让爱子负责照顾宠物。

As the trio entered the pet store they saw that the inside was much bigger than what it seemed on the outside with the room stretching way back with many glass displays showing many animals and around the entrance were many pet foods, accessories and even various books near the counter with an old man behind it who was quietly reading a book. Seeing their appearance, as well as the sound of the doorbell alerted him to their presence. Settling his book down the old man got up from his chair and walked around the counter to greet the three.  
当三人走进宠物店时，他们发现里面比外面看起来要大得多，房间一直延伸到深处，许多玻璃展示柜里展示着各种动物，入口周围摆满了宠物食品、配件，甚至还有几本书靠近柜台，柜台后坐着一位正在安静阅读的老者。看到他们的到来，以及门铃的响声，他注意到了他们的存在。老者放下书本，从椅子上起身，绕过柜台前来迎接这三位客人。

"Hello there and welcome. I'm Suzuki Taro, the owner of this new establishment." The old man gave them a short bow.  
“你们好，欢迎光临。我是这家新店的老板，铃木太郎。”老者向他们微微鞠了一躬。

Shinji gave a polite bow back to the man. "Hello sir," the young father greeted while Asuka gave a nod and Aki gave the man a shy little wave to Mr Suzuki.  
真嗣礼貌地向老者回了一礼，“您好，先生。”这位年轻的父亲问候道，而明日香点了点头，亚纪则害羞地向铃木先生挥了挥手。

"How can I help you, youngsters? Looking to buy a pet today or some accessories or even food and treats for an existing pet you already have?" the store owner was already trying to make a sale today.  
“年轻人，我能帮你们什么忙吗？今天想买宠物、配件，还是给现有的宠物买点食物和零食？”店主今天已经开始尝试推销了。

"I apologise, sir, we came in just for a look. Aki-chan here wanted to see the animals," Shinji replied as he gave the older man an apologetic smile while also giving Aki's hair a ruffle.  
“抱歉，先生，我们只是来看看。Aki-chan 想看看动物，”真嗣回答道，同时向老人歉意地笑了笑，并揉了揉 Aki 的头发。

"Oh don't worry it's perfectly fine. I understand kids wanting to see all these cute critters, I've had a few customers come in in the last few days doing the same, so have a good look around," Mr Suzuki said giving the three the go-ahead to explore his shop.  
“哦，别担心，完全没问题。我理解孩子们想看这些可爱的小动物，最近几天也有几位顾客来店里做同样的事，所以你们随意看看吧，”铃木先生说着，给了三人探索他店铺的许可。

"Yay!" Aki cried out as she was let loose to look around. She quickly turned back to the window display where the kittens and puppies were located. "Awww, hi little kitties! Ah hi, little puppies!" Aki called out and cooed at the small animal's cuteness. The kittens and puppies all cried out as they pressed their little paws to the glass wanting attention from the brown-haired little girl.  
"耶！" 阿基欢呼着被放开，可以四处看看了。她迅速转身回到展示窗前，那里有小猫和小狗。"哇，小猫咪们好可爱！啊，还有小狗狗们！" 阿基对着这些小动物的可爱模样呼唤着，发出温柔的声音。小猫和小狗们都叫了起来，它们的小爪子贴在玻璃上，渴望得到这位棕发小女孩的注意。

"Hello!" an unknown croaky voice called out diverting Aki's attention. Upon turning around, Aki was confused about who called.  
"你好！" 一个陌生的沙哑声音喊道，吸引了阿基的注意。转过身来，阿基困惑地想知道是谁在叫她。

"Er…hello?" an unsure Aki called back.  
"呃…你好？" 阿基不确定地回应道。

"Hello, hello!" the strange voice called out and to Aki's surprise, it came from a big bird cage which inside was a grey parrot.  
“你好，你好！”那个奇怪的声音喊道，让秋惊讶的是，这声音来自一个大鸟笼，里面关着一只灰色的鹦鹉。

"Wait…did he just talk?" Aki asked in wonder.  
“等等……他刚才是说话了吗？”秋惊奇地问道。

"Talk, talk!" the parrot called out as if answering Aki's question.  
“说话，说话！”鹦鹉叫道，仿佛在回答秋的问题。

Aki gasped in surprise before rushing over to the bird cage where the parrot reside. "Mama, Papa! Come over here, this birdy can talk!"  
阿基惊讶地倒吸一口气，随即冲向鹦鹉所在的鸟笼。“妈妈，爸爸！快过来看，这只小鸟会说话！”

"Oh really?" Asuka said pretending not to know that parrots could do that as she and Shinji got closer to where Aki was.  
“哦，真的吗？”明日香假装不知道鹦鹉会说话，她和真嗣一起走近阿基所在的地方。

"Yeah, he did talk. Wow, he must be really really smart, even smarter than PenPen is since he can't do that." Aki replied.  
“是啊，他确实说话了。哇，他一定非常非常聪明，甚至比 PenPen 还聪明，因为他不会说话。”阿基回答道。

x-x

Not too far away at the Katsuragi apartment a certain warm water penguin, who was reading the newspaper on the couch, let out a mighty big sneeze unexpectedly and for a moment was confused about where that sneeze came from without warning.  
在距离不远的葛城公寓里，某只温暖的热水企鹅正坐在沙发上看报纸，突然打了一个响亮的喷嚏，一时间有些困惑这喷嚏从何而来，毫无预警。

"Bless you PenPen," Misato who was grabbing a can of juice from the main fridge had heard the sneeze coming from her little roommate from the kitchen, responded kindly.  
“保佑你，PenPen。”正在从主冰箱里拿果汁的 Misato 听到了厨房里小室友的喷嚏声，亲切地回应道。

x-x

"Hello, birdy! My name is Aki! What's your name?" Aki asked the talking bird.  
“你好，小鸟！我叫 Aki！你叫什么名字？”Aki 问那只会说话的鸟。

"My name is Aki, my name is Aki," the bird mimicked back to the unknowing little girl.  
"我的名字是 Aki，我的名字是 Aki，" 鸟儿模仿着回应对这个名字一无所知的小女孩。

"Wow, no way, that's my name too!" Aki cried out in excitement, completely oblivious to her two parents snickering behind her. "What's your favourite colour Aki birdy? Mine is red."  
"哇，不会吧，我的名字也是 Aki！" Aki 兴奋地喊道，完全没有注意到身后的父母在偷笑。"你最喜欢的颜色是什么，Aki 鸟儿？我最喜欢红色。"

"Mine is red, mine is red," the parrot copied again.  
"我最喜欢红色，我最喜欢红色，" 鹦鹉再次模仿道。

"Wow, that's amazing. What's your favourite food then? I like anything with meat in it."  
“哇，太神奇了。那你最喜欢什么食物？我喜欢任何有肉的东西。”

"Anything with meat, anything with meat," the parrot again copied Aki, with the girl not realising that she was just being copied word for word.  
“任何有肉的，任何有肉的，”鹦鹉再次模仿了 Aki，而女孩并没有意识到她的话被一字不差地复制了。

Completely amazed, Aki turned to her parents who managed to hide their snickering and chuckling. "Mama, Papa! This bird is like me in every way! Can we keep him?"  
完全被惊呆了，Aki 转向她的父母，他们设法掩饰住了窃笑。“妈妈，爸爸！这只鸟和我一模一样！我们可以留下它吗？”

At this moment that Shinji knew he end this. "No Aki we said before we just came to look and that we can't have any pets yet," Shinji said as he gave his daughter a stern look to remind her. "Also the parrot is just mimicking you and isn't called Aki," Shinji finished explaining.  
就在这一刻，真嗣知道他必须结束这一切。“不，Aki，我们之前说过，我们只是来看看，还不能养宠物。”真嗣严肃地看着女儿，提醒她。“而且，这只鹦鹉只是在模仿你，它并不叫 Aki。”真嗣解释道。

"Wha! ….Really Papa!?" Aki looked back and forth between her father and the bird, a look of disappointment slowly dawning on her face.  
“啊！……真的吗，爸爸？”Aki 在父亲和鹦鹉之间来回看，脸上慢慢浮现出失望的表情。

"Wha! Really Papa, really Papa," the parrot continued to mimic, at which Aki turned fully back to him but a frown and pout were now visible on her face.  
“啊！真的，爸爸，真的，爸爸。”鹦鹉继续模仿着，Aki 完全转回身面对它，但脸上已经露出了皱眉和撅嘴的表情。

"Then this birdy is a phoney, a big fat phoney!" Aki exclaimed as she pointed her finger accusingly at the bird in the cage.  
"那这只鸟儿就是个骗子，一个超级大骗子！" 阿基指着笼子里的鸟，愤愤地指责道。

"Fat phoney, fat phoney," the bird repeated, further making Aki frown.  
"大骗子，大骗子，" 鸟儿重复着，让阿基的眉头皱得更深了。

"Way to spoil the fun, Baka," Asuka voiced while giving him a hard nudge in his rib, slightly annoyed at her husband for having ruined an amusing show.  
"真是扫兴，笨蛋，" 明日香说着，用力撞了一下他的肋骨，略带恼怒地责怪丈夫破坏了一场有趣的表演。

"Baka, Baka!" the parrot copied again, with Shinji now frowning at the bird, not amused with it using that word. Only Asuka had the right to call him that.  
"笨蛋，笨蛋！" 鹦鹉再次模仿道，这让真嗣皱起了眉头，对这只鸟使用那个词感到不悦。只有明日香有权这样称呼他。

"Baka, Baka, Baka, Baka, Baka!" the parrot now continued to use the word much to Shinji's displeasure and Asuka's annoyance. Behind them, they heard Mr Suzuki laugh.  
"笨蛋，笨蛋，笨蛋，笨蛋，笨蛋！" 鹦鹉现在继续使用这个词，让真嗣感到不快，也让明日香感到恼火。在他们身后，他们听到铃木先生笑了起来。

"Oh boy, looks like Anno found a favourite word today," the man chuckled. "Guess I'll be hearing that for a while hehe,"  
"哦，天哪，看来今日子找到了一个最喜欢的词，" 那人轻声笑道。"猜我接下来会听到这个词好一阵子，呵呵，"

Asuka had the decency to slightly blush in embarrassment before giving the old man an apologetic look. Before she could give a verbal apology they heard Aki a bit further down into the shop.  
明日香有些尴尬地微微脸红，然后向老人投去歉意的目光。在她能开口道歉之前，他们听到店里稍远处的阿基在喊。

"Mama, Papa! Look look!" Aki called out as she was looking into a glass display which housed some little tiny furry critters. As Asuka and Shinji joined her, Aki looked at them for knowledge. "What are these?"  
“妈妈，爸爸！快看快看！”阿基一边看着玻璃展示柜里的小小毛茸茸生物，一边喊道。当明日香和真嗣走近时，阿基抬头望着他们，寻求答案。“这些是什么？”

"Well, honey these are hamsters. You remember we read a book on them before," Shinji reminded Aki but then thought remembering that Aki was a bit younger back then so she probably didn't remember that particular storybook.  
“嗯，亲爱的，这些是仓鼠。你还记得我们之前读过一本关于它们的书吗，”真嗣提醒阿基，但随即想到阿基那时还小，可能不记得那本故事书了。

"Ooh, I remember that! So these are hamsters," Aki remembered as she once again stared into the small glass display and upon looking in again she laughed as she saw one hamster stuff its food into his mouth making its cheeks bulge out. "That hamster is stuffing his cheeks, hehe!"  
"哦，我记得那个！所以这些都是仓鼠，" 阿基回忆着，再次凝视着小玻璃展示柜，当她再次看进去时，她笑着看到一只仓鼠把食物塞进嘴里，使它的脸颊鼓起来。"那只仓鼠在塞满它的脸颊，呵呵！"

"Oh didn't you do that a few days ago Schätzchen," Asuka teased her daughter while pinching her cheeks making Aki giggle in response.  
"哦，你前几天不是也这么做了吗，宝贝，" 明日香逗弄着她的女儿，同时捏着她的脸颊，让阿基咯咯笑了起来。

It was true that a few nights ago Aki stuffed her mouth full of her favourite ramen dish, being pork ramen, without swallowing, which earn some laughs from everyone in the Katsuragi apartment, even more when Asuka pinched Aki's cheeks at the time the little girl had accidentally spit out the contents of her mouth which unfortunately some of it had sprayed some bits over Shinji and PenPen at the time.  
确实，几天前的晚上，阿基把她最喜欢的拉面——猪肉拉面——塞满了嘴巴，没有吞咽，这让卡茨拉吉公寓里的每个人都笑了起来，尤其是当明日香当时捏着阿基的脸颊，小女孩不小心把嘴里的东西吐了出来，不幸的是，其中一些溅到了当时的真嗣和 PenPen 身上。

Just as Asuka finished chuckling at that memory, Aki moved to the next display and saw some unfamiliar creatures.  
就在明日香为那个记忆轻笑完之际，绫波走向下一个展柜，看到了一些陌生的生物。

"Are these hamsters too?" Aki asked as she tilted her head confused at the furry creatures that were bigger than the smaller hamsters.  
“这些也是仓鼠吗？”绫波歪着头，困惑地看着那些比小仓鼠大得多的毛茸茸的生物。

"No honey, these are guinea pigs," Shinji said.  
“不，亲爱的，这些是豚鼠。”真嗣解释道。

"Gene…pigs?…They don't look piggies," Aki said with a frown, confused as she turned to the said creatures again. "Piggies are all pink and have springy little tails," Aki explained to her parents thinking she was in the right while she folded her arms. "I'm just gonna call them guineas but not piggies!"  
"基因…猪？…它们看起来不像小猪，" 阿基皱着眉头说道，困惑地再次转向那些生物。"小猪都是粉红色的，还有弹力十足的小尾巴，" 阿基向她的父母解释道，认为自己是对的，同时交叉双臂。"我只会叫它们豚鼠，但不是小猪！"

Shinji and Asuka chuckled at Aki's firm decision on the matter before the little girl moved away from the guinea pig display to a much bigger next one that was more of a cubicle enclosure at ground level, which seeing herself, Aki did a light gasp at what she saw.  
真嗣和明日香对阿基在这件事上的坚定决定轻声笑了起来，随后小女孩离开了豚鼠展区，走向一个更大的、更像是地面上的小隔间的展区，看到自己，阿基轻轻地倒吸了一口气。

"Aww it's cute little bunnies!" Aki squealed in delight at seeing a couple of the white furry creatures. "Hey what's up little bunnies?" Aki asked the bunnies, making Asuka and Shinji chuckle, though it quickly died and they gasp in shock and horror when the two parents saw the two bunnies were beginning to do something that a innocent child like Aki shouldn't be seeing.  
"哇，这些小兔子真可爱！" 阿基看到几只白色毛茸茸的小动物时兴奋地尖叫起来。"嘿，小兔子们，你们好吗？" 阿基问兔子们，让明日香和真嗣轻声笑了起来，但很快笑声就消失了，他们惊恐地倒吸一口气，因为两位父母看到那两只兔子开始做一些像阿基这样天真无邪的孩子不应该看到的事情。

"What's the bunnies do…" Aki tried to ask but her eyes were quickly covered by her parents as well as quickly pulled along by her parents.  
"兔子们在做什么…" 阿基试图询问，但她的眼睛很快被父母捂住，同时被迅速拉走。

"Nothing! I mean nothing Schätzchen, they were just err…playing," Asuka very quickly came up with an excuse. "Now let's move to the next one ok?"  
"没什么！我是说没什么，宝贝，它们只是在…呃…玩耍，" 明日香迅速找了个借口。"现在我们去下一个地方好吗？"

After clearing well away from the bunny enclosure, Asuka and Shinji let go of Aki allowing her to see the next display but upon seeing what was inside the two parents paused and grimaced seeing the creatures inside.  
在远离兔子围栏后，明日香和真嗣松开了阿基，让她去看下一个展示，但当看到里面的生物时，两位父母停下脚步，皱起了眉头。

"Mama, Papa! Look it's some little mouses!" Aki cheerfully said, unaware of her parent's discomfort.  
"妈妈，爸爸！看，有小老鼠！" 阿基高兴地说，没注意到父母的不安。

In the display cases was a pair of rodents that weren't mouses per se but actual rats. Back in the post third impact world they lived in, the family unfortunately had to deal with a bit of a rodent problem for a time.  
展示柜里是一对啮齿动物，严格来说不是老鼠，而是真正的老鼠。在第三次冲击后的世界里，他们不幸遭遇了一段时间的啮齿动物问题。

Normally Asuka and Shinji had to deal with the rats when they threw their trash at the local dump in the ruined city but one must have hitched a ride back with them when they later had to deal with a mini infestation in their home.  
通常情况下，明日香和真嗣在废墟城市的当地垃圾场扔垃圾时得对付这些老鼠，但有一次，一只老鼠可能趁机搭了便车，后来他们在家中遭遇了小规模的侵扰。

Luckily they were able to quickly deal with the problem before it got out of hand by playing rat catcher and setting traps before the rodents could multiply out of control in their home. Before that, Aki even caught one on her own much to the horror of her parents, after which Shinji gave Aki a full medical examination just in case his little girl might have caught some diseases from it, as well as a very long bath much to the irritation of the brown haired girl.  
幸运的是，他们迅速解决了问题，赶在情况失控之前扮演捕鼠人，设下陷阱，防止老鼠在家中失控繁殖。在那之前，Aki 甚至独自捉到了一只，这让她的父母大为惊恐。之后，Shinji 为了确保他的小女儿没有从老鼠身上感染任何疾病，给她做了一次全面体检，还让她洗了一个很长时间的澡，这让棕发女孩颇为恼火。

Lucky Aki didn't seem fascinated by the rats as much and they continued their look around with Aki cooing and smiling at the other pets around, from seeing the small aquarium displays with goldfish in them to seeing the small birds and budgies, which Aki even asked the small birds if they knew Mr birdy, which brought a small sad look between Asuka and Shinji knowing that their small avian visitor that came regularly to them was no longer around due to them going back in time. They were already bracing for the emotional impact when they would have to tell Aki that Mr birdy was no longer going to be coming to them when they officially move back to their home.  
幸运的是，Aki 似乎对老鼠并不那么着迷，他们继续四处参观，Aki 对着周围的宠物们咕咕叫着，微笑着，从观赏小金鱼缸到小鸟和鹦鹉，Aki 甚至还问小鸟们是否认识 Mr birdy，这让 Asuka 和 Shinji 之间闪过一丝悲伤，因为他们知道，那个经常来访的小鸟朋友因为回到过去而不再出现了。他们已经准备好面对告诉 Aki Mr birdy 不会再来的情感冲击，当他们正式搬回自己的家时。

"Hey, what's back there?" Aki questioned which broke Asuka and Shinji out of their shared thoughts and saw Aki looking at the very back of the store itself.  
"嘿，那边是什么？" 阿基的问题打断了明日香和真嗣的共同思绪，他们看到阿基正盯着商店最里面看。

"Oh back there is a few more exotic kind of animals for sale," the store owner Mr Suzuki replied, slightly making the young parents jump in surprise considering that the old man was no longer at the front and had managed to sneak up on them. They also saw the man going around and feeding the animals.  
"哦，那边是一些更珍稀的动物在出售，" 店主铃木先生回答道，这让年轻的父母吓了一跳，因为老人已经不在前面，悄无声息地靠近了他们。他们还看到老人绕着圈给动物们喂食。

"E..eroric?" Aki tried to repeat the word, having never heard such a word before.  
"珍...珍稀的？" 阿基尝试重复这个词，他从未听过这样的词汇。

"Oh that just means very special kind of creatures," Mr Suzuki explained to the brown-haired girl, who gasped in wonder before rushing towards the back. Asuka and Shinji sighed with knowing smiles following her.  
"哦，那只是意味着非常特别的生物，"铃木先生向棕色头发的女孩解释道，她惊叹一声后便急忙向后方跑去。明日香和真嗣带着会心的微笑叹了口气。

"Ooh Mama, Papa look it's a snape…no a snake!" Aki exclaimed while she pressed her face close to the glass. Inside the display was indeed a green snake which coiled up and directly looked at the family while it was repeatedly sticking its tongue out to them. "Hehe look at the way it sticks its tongue out…Wait, is it doing a raspberry at me?" Aki questioned as she turned to her parents for an answer.  
"哦，妈妈，爸爸，看，是斯内普……不，是蛇！"阿基兴奋地喊着，将脸贴近玻璃。展示柜内确实盘踞着一条绿色的蛇，它直视着一家人，并不停地向他们吐着舌头。"呵呵，看它吐舌头的样子……等等，它是在对我做鬼脸吗？"阿基转向父母寻求答案。

Chuckling at this both Asuka and Shinji shook their heads negatively. "No honey, it's just something that snakes do all the time so it's not mocking you," Shinji reassured Aki.  
明日香和真嗣听到这话都轻声笑了起来，两人都摇了摇头。"不，宝贝，这只是蛇经常做的动作，并不是在嘲笑你，"真嗣安慰阿基道。

"Oh ok…oh ooh look Mama, Papa! It's little tiny turtles," Aki cried out again having caught a glimpse at the next display case and already forgetting the snake. Inside the display had four tiny baby turtles all submerged in a small tiny pond in their enclosure.  
"哦，好的……哦，妈妈，爸爸，快看！是小乌龟，" 阿基再次兴奋地喊道，目光已经转向了下一个展示柜，忘记了刚才的蛇。展示柜里有四只小小的幼龟，全都沉浸在它们围栏里的小小池塘中。

"They're so tiny," Aki looked at the small reptiles more closely. "The ones at the aquarium were bigger than these," Aki said, clearly remembering the trip to the aquarium and having seen the bigger turtles back then.  
"它们好小啊，" 阿基更仔细地观察着这些小爬行动物。"水族馆里的那些比这些大多了，" 阿基说道，显然还记得那次去水族馆的经历，当时看到的乌龟要大得多。

Eventually, Aki got bored after a minute seeing that the turtles didn't do anything and moved on to the next display case, though she became confused when she couldn't see anything visible inside except a lone fly.  
不久，阿基在一分钟后感到无聊，因为乌龟什么也没做，于是她转向了下一个展示柜，但当她除了看到一只孤零零的苍蝇外，什么也没看到时，她感到困惑。

"Hey, this is one empty," Aki complained with a frown on her face but that changed when something long and pink quietly caught the fly on the glass, making Aki jump in fright for a second before looking in again more closely and upon focusing saw where the long pink thing came from and gasped in surprise.  
"嘿，这里真空荡荡的，" 亚纪皱着眉抱怨道，但当一条长长的粉色物体悄悄捉住了玻璃上的苍蝇时，她的表情变了，亚纪吓得跳了起来，然后更仔细地再次看向里面，集中注意力后发现了那条粉色物体的来源，惊讶地倒吸了一口气。

"Mama, Papa, it's a weird-looking lizard inside!"  
"妈妈，爸爸，里面有只奇怪的蜥蜴！"

"Yeah, Schätzchen that's a chameleon. Don't you remember that book you liked with the chameleon in different colours?" Asuka said to her daughter, trying to remind her of one of her past favourite books."  
"是啊，宝贝，那是一只变色龙。你不记得那本你喜欢的书里，有各种颜色的变色龙吗？" 明日香对女儿说，试图唤起她对过去最喜欢的一本书的记忆。"

"Wait, so this is a comeloon? It looks difficult from the book," Aki questioned as she looked at the lizard again and was fascinated when the creature slowly started changing colour as it moved to another spot.  
"等等，这是一只变色龙吗？书上看起来很难的样子，" 亚纪再次看向那只蜥蜴，当它慢慢移动到另一个位置并开始改变颜色时，她被深深吸引住了。

After the two parents explained why the chameleon changes colours all the time they eventually moved on to the next display and found a tiny white creature.  
在两位父母解释了变色龙为何会不断变换颜色后，他们最终移步到下一个展示区，发现了一只小小的白色生物。

"Aww, it's soo cute!" Aki gushed in happiness at the tiny thing.  
"哇，好可爱啊！" 亚纪看到这个小家伙，开心地赞叹道。

"Yeah it's surprisingly cute for a moth," Shinji said while looking at her tiny moth inside.  
"哇，这只蛾子出奇地可爱，" 真嗣看着她的小蛾子说道。

"Wha..what? That's not a moth, Papa!" Aki exclaimed. She knew what regular moths looked like and this cute little thing wasn't it.  
"什...什么？那不是蛾子，爸爸！" 阿基惊呼。她知道普通的蛾子长什么样，这个小可爱可不是。

"But honey, it is a moth, look it's written on the top here, it's called Venezuelan poodle moth," Shinji said as he pointed to the small paper card which had the small moth's name.  
"但是宝贝，它确实是蛾子，看这里，上面写着呢，它叫委内瑞拉贵宾犬蛾，" 真嗣指着那张小纸卡，上面写着小蛾子的名字。

"Ehhhh!? No way!" Aki cried out in disbelief.  
"诶？！不可能！" 阿基难以置信地喊道。

"Schätzchen, you need to understand that there are many different types of moth and not just ones we usually find at home. The same with other animals as there are different types of the same creature, you understand?" Asuka asked Aki to which the little girl hesitantly nodded.  
"亲爱的，你需要明白世界上有很多不同种类的飞蛾，不仅仅是我们家里常见的那种。就像其他动物一样，同一种生物也有不同的类型，你明白吗？" 明日香向阿基解释道，小女孩犹豫地点了点头。

"Well, I'm not gonna call little whitey a moth though," Aki said, stubbornly refusing to call what she had dubbed little whitey a moth, making Asuka and Shinji chuckle.  
"好吧，我可不会把小白叫做飞蛾，" 阿基固执地说，不肯承认她称之为小白的东西是飞蛾，这让明日香和真嗣忍不住笑了起来。

Again the three moved along and found that they were finally at the back of the store but found that the displays here all had a variety of bugs, worms and other creepy crawlies.  
三人再次前行，终于来到了商店的后部，却发现这里的陈列品全是各式各样的昆虫、蠕虫和其他令人毛骨悚然的小生物。

"Err…yeah I think we've seen enough," Shinji said with Asuka nodding in agreement. They began to walk back to the front of the store but noticed that Aki hadn't moved along with them and was silently staring into a display case.  
“呃…我觉得我们已经看得够多了，”真嗣说道，明日香点头表示同意。他们开始往商店前部走去，却发现亚纪没有跟上来，而是静静地凝视着一个展示柜。

"Wow…that's a really big one," Aki said in a whispered tone and as Asuka and Shinji came near to her, they froze as they also saw what their little one was looking at.  
“哇…那只真的很大，”亚纪轻声说道，当明日香和真嗣走近她时，他们也僵住了，因为他们看到了亚纪正在注视的东西。

Inside the display case was a very, very big spider or more accurately a tarantula, which seemed to be staring back at the trio.  
展示柜里有一只非常大，非常非常大的蜘蛛，或者更准确地说是一只狼蛛，它似乎正盯着三人组看。

"Ye..yeah that's a big spider honey," Shinji said while feeling unnerved and squeamish while looking at the large eight-legged arachnid. Granted the family were familiar with small local spiders given that they lived out on the edge of the countryside near the city but this was way bigger than the ones that they dealt with in the past.  
“是...是啊，亲爱的，那蜘蛛真大，”真嗣说道，同时感到不安和恶心，目光停留在那只八条腿的大蜘蛛上。当然，由于他们家住在城市边缘的乡村地带，对当地的小蜘蛛并不陌生，但这次遇到的比以往任何时候都要大得多。

"Well, we've seen a bigger pest before, right Shinji," Asuka added, giving her husband a knowing grin. For a second Shinji was confused but he soon figured out what she meant, referring to the time when he, Asuka and Rei had gone up against the ninth Angel Matarael which had the similar appearance of a giant spider with long legs.  
“好吧，我们以前见过更大的麻烦，对吧，真嗣，”明日香补充道，向她的丈夫投去一个心领神会的微笑。真嗣一时有些困惑，但他很快明白了她的意思，指的是他和明日香、丽曾经对抗过的第九使徒马塔拉尔，那家伙有着类似巨型蜘蛛的长腿。

Shinji gave a short chuckle, remembering the time when all three Eva pilots worked together before everything started going downhill and falling apart. He felt Asuka grab his hand and he looked to see Asuka giving him a smile knowing that she was remembering those somewhat good times too.  
真嗣轻声笑了一下，回想起三位 EVA 驾驶员曾经合作无间的时光，那时一切还未开始走下坡路，分崩离析。他感觉到明日香握住了他的手，转头一看，明日香正对他微笑，显然她也想起了那些还算美好的时光。

"Wait, you have seen an even bigger spider than this, Mama, Papa!?" Aki questioned in disbelief while she pointed and poked her finger at the tarantula in the box display. An action that made the big arachnid move quickly to the family, showing his huge fangs and startled the little girl making her move further back away from the big spider.  
"等等，你们见过比这个还大的蜘蛛，妈妈，爸爸！？" 阿基难以置信地问道，同时用手指着展示盒里的狼蛛。这一动作让那只巨大的蛛形动物迅速向家人移动，露出巨大的毒牙，吓得小女孩连连后退，远离那只大蜘蛛。

"Yes we have Schätzchen, but that's a story for another time, ok?" Asuka said, not wanting to give any details on their pasts of being Eva pilots to Aki. "Come on, it's time for us to get home, ok?"  
"是的，宝贝，但我们改天再讲那个故事，好吗？" 明日香说道，不想向阿基透露他们作为 EVA 驾驶员的过去。"来吧，我们该回家了，好吗？"

"Aww, but I want to stay longer," Aki whined as she was tugged along by her hand by her mother.  
“哎呀，我还想多待一会儿呢，”亚纪抱怨着，被母亲拉着手的她不得不跟着走。

As the trio came back to the front entrance they saw that Mr Suzuki had opened the store's front display that housed the kittens and was in the process of feeding them, but what surprised Asuka and Shinji was the person who they knew very well that just came into the store.  
当三人回到前门时，他们看到铃木先生已经打开了存放小猫的商店前展示柜，正在给它们喂食，但让明日香和真嗣惊讶的是，他们非常熟悉的那个人刚刚走进了店里。

"Doctor Akagi!" both Asuka and Shinji said in sync upon seeing the blonde doctor. It was a surprise for the Doctor too, as hearing her name called out caused her to slightly jump startled before she looked at the family.  
“赤木博士！”明日香和真嗣异口同声地喊道，看到这位金发医生让他们感到意外。博士也感到惊讶，听到自己的名字被叫出，她微微一惊，然后看向了这家人。

"Oh…this is a surprise. I didn't expect to see you three here," Ritsuko said.  
"哦……这真是个惊喜。我没想到会在这里见到你们三个，" 律子说道。

"That's funny we didn't expect you here either," Asuka replied.  
"真巧，我们也没料到会在这里见到你，" 明日香回答道。

"Good evening Doctor Akagi," Shinji being polite gave the doctor a light bow. "Yeah, we just came in because Aki wanted to see the pets in the store. What about you, what brings you here?" Shinji finished saying, wondering why the doctor was in a place such as this.  
"晚上好，赤木博士，" 真嗣礼貌地向医生微微鞠了一躬。"是啊，我们只是因为阿基想看看店里的宠物才进来的。你呢，是什么风把你吹到这里来了？" 真嗣说完，好奇医生为何会出现在这样的地方。

Upon this question, Ritsuko's face showed a tint of embarrassment on her face. "Well, I needed to get some cat food for my own. Since I've got so much free time now, I could bring them back to my apartment."  
面对这个问题，律子的脸上露出一丝尴尬。“嗯，我需要给我的猫买点食物。既然现在我有很多空闲时间，我可以把它们带回我的公寓。”

"…I see," was what Asuka and Shinji said together. They knew that Ritsuko had pet cats from past conversations with Misato when the purpled-haired woman even joked that the blonde doctor was becoming a crazy cat person.  
“…我明白了，”明日香和真嗣异口同声地说。他们从之前与美里交谈中得知律子养了宠物猫，连紫发的美里都曾开玩笑说这位金发博士快变成疯狂的猫奴了。

"Wait, you have kitties Ms Akagi!?" Aki asked the older woman in excitement.  
“等等，你有小猫咪吗，赤木博士？”阿基兴奋地问这位年长的女士。

"Err, yes, I have three little ones at home," Ritsuko told the four-year-old truthfully, still somewhat unsure how to approach the supposedly time travelling child of the former Eva pilots.  
"呃，是的，我家里有三个小家伙，" 赤木律子如实地告诉这个四岁的小孩，仍然有些不确定如何应对这个据称是前 Eva 驾驶员穿越时空的孩子。

"Can I see them!?" Aki exclaimed to the fake blonde doctor who was surprised by such a request. Aki turned to her parents for confirmation. "Mama, Papa can we visit and see Ms Akagi's kitties?"  
"我能看看它们吗！？" 明美兴奋地对这位金发假医生喊道，对方对这样的请求感到惊讶。明美转向她的父母寻求确认。"妈妈，爸爸，我们可以去拜访并看看赤木小姐的猫咪吗？"

"Err…maybe another time honey. Right now we need to get home and prepare dinner and I'm sure Doctor Akagi is busy and can't have visitors right now," Shinji told his daughter hoping that this would deter her from making a massive detour. Also while the two former Eva pilots had nothing against the blonde doctor and were very thankful to her for the critical help during the final battle with the mass production Eva's they both felt that she was kinda cold at times and most obviously a workaholic and giving her attitude before around them before wasn't great much less with kids around Aki's age.  
"呃…或许改天吧，亲爱的。现在我们需要回家准备晚餐，而且我相信赤木医生现在很忙，不能接待访客，" 真嗣告诉他的女儿，希望这能阻止她做出巨大的绕路。此外，尽管两位前 Eva 驾驶员对这位金发医生没有任何反感，并且非常感激她在与量产 Eva 的最终战斗中提供的关键帮助，但他们都感觉到她有时有点冷漠，显然是个工作狂，而且在他们面前之前的态度并不太好，更不用说在孩子像明美这么大的时候了。

"Ahh man," Aki pouted, clearly disappointed that she couldn't see the doctor's cats but her disappointment was cut short as she turned to the actual kittens before her just as Mr Suzuki had shut the case they were in after having given them their food.  
"哎呀，真遗憾，" 阿基噘着嘴，显然因为看不到医生的猫而感到失望，但她的失望很快就被眼前的实际小猫打断了，就在铃木先生给它们喂完食后关上了它们所在的箱子。

"Hello there miss. What can I do for you?" Mr Suzuki asked the blonde doctor.  
"您好，小姐。有什么我能帮您的吗？" 铃木先生问那位金发医生。

"Oh yes, I just came in for some cat food and in bulk if possible please?" Ritsuko asked the store owner.  
"哦，是的，我来买些猫粮，如果可能的话，请给我大量装。" 律子向店主问道。

"Oh the cat food is near the back down there," Mr Suzuki pointed in the said direction which Ritsuko gave thanks and proceeded to go down to. Mr Suzuki looked at the small family and smiled at them. "So did you kids have a good look around the store?"  
"哦，猫粮在那边靠后的地方，" 铃木先生指向所说的方向，这让 Ritsuko 表示感谢并走下去。铃木先生看着这小家庭，对他们微笑。"那么，孩子们在店里逛得还开心吗？"

"Yes we did, thanks for letting us look around Mr Suzuki," Shinji gave thanks as a did a short bow.  
"是的，我们逛得很开心，谢谢您让我们参观，铃木先生，" 真嗣表示感谢并微微鞠了一躬。

"Oh, it's alright. You are not the first kids to want to look around the store. I've had many come in today and bought many of our animals, heck I'm surprised that I've still got many cats and dogs left to sell, hehe," the man chuckled.  
"哦，没关系。你们不是第一个想在店里逛逛的孩子。今天来了很多孩子，买走了我们不少动物，说真的，我挺惊讶还有这么多猫狗没卖出去，呵呵，" 那人笑着说。

"Ok Schätzchen, ready to…go?" Asuka turned to look where Aki was only to find the little girl had disappeared. "Aki? AKI!?"  
"好的宝贝，准备好……出发了吗？" 明日香转身寻找爱希，却发现小女孩已经不见了。"爱希？爱希！？"

Fortunately, the panic attack was brief after hearing Aki's light laughing and giggling. Both Asuka and Shinji soon found the source and to their surprise their daughter was actually inside the kitten display case, hugging them as she was surrounded by the tiny felines.  
幸运的是，听到爱希轻快的笑声和咯咯笑后，恐慌发作很快就平息了。不久，明日香和真嗣找到了声音的来源，令他们惊讶的是，他们的女儿竟然在猫咪展示柜里，被一群小猫围绕着，紧紧地抱着它们。

"Mama, Papa, look look! The kitties all like me!" Aki called out and giggled once again when a kitten closest to her left side climbed on her shoulder and gave the brown-haired girl a lick to her face.  
"妈妈，爸爸，快看快看！猫咪们都喜欢我！" 爱希喊道，当一只靠近她左侧的小猫爬上她的肩膀，舔了舔她的脸时，她再次咯咯笑了起来。

As utterly adorable as the scene was, it was impolite in Shinji's eyes. "Aki honey, what are you doing in there?"  
尽管这一幕无比可爱，但在真嗣看来却有些失礼。“阿基，亲爱的，你在里面做什么呢？”

"The kitties were crying, Papa, and the door was open," Aki explained.  
“小猫咪们在哭，爸爸，门是开着的，”阿基解释道。

"Oh dear I must have forgotten to lock the display door again, hehe," Mr Suzuki gave a short laugh while scratching the back of his head. Also, the man didn't seem to mind Aki being inside with the cats. "Good thing the animals didn't get out this time, hehe," the old man laughed again and Asuka and Shinji were dumbfounded at the man's easygoing attitude to the situation.  
“哎呀，我一定是又忘了锁展示门的锁了，呵呵，”铃木先生一边挠着后脑勺一边短促地笑了一声。而且，他似乎并不介意阿基和猫待在一起。“还好这次动物们没有跑出来，呵呵，”老人再次笑了起来，而明日香和真嗣对这位老人对情况的随和态度感到目瞪口呆。

"Aki, come on, you need to get out of there right now," Shinji firmly told his daughter as he opened the case. Unfortunately for him, Aki didn't want to leave giving she hugged the small kittens more towards her as she slightly backed away as much as she could in the confines of the small space.  
“阿基，快点，你现在得马上离开那里。”真嗣坚定地对女儿说，同时打开了箱子。不幸的是，阿基并不想离开，她紧紧抱住那些小猫，尽可能地在狭小的空间里向后缩。

"Nooo! The kitties need me, Papa!" Aki childishly whined out and gave her father the puppy dog pout look, hoping to get her way. The kittens around Aki seem to be on the same wavelength as the girl as they all looked at him and were giving the young father the same big-eyed helpless look.  
“不要！小猫咪需要我，爸爸！”阿基孩子气地抱怨着，向父亲露出可怜巴巴的表情，希望能如愿以偿。围绕在阿基身边的小猫们似乎与女孩心有灵犀，它们都看着他，用同样无辜的大眼睛望着这位年轻的父亲。

'_Oh come on! Seriously this isn't fair!_' Shinji thought. It was very hard to deny Aki anything especially when she did the pout look but now the damn cats were giving him the look too. Turning to Asuka for some backup but found that Asuka was not so innocently looking well away, hands behind her back and even whistling.  
“哦，拜托！这真的不公平！”真嗣心想。拒绝阿基任何事情本来就很难，尤其是当她露出那种表情时，但现在连这些该死的猫也在用同样的眼神看他。他转向明日香寻求支援，却发现明日香并不那么无辜地望向别处，双手背在身后，甚至还吹着口哨。

"Asuka please," Shinji begged desperately to his wife hoping that she would help him with the situation. Thankfully after a moment, Asuka decided to take pity on him as her eyes turned back to him before rolling them, moving to him and whispering the solution in his ear.  
"Asuka，求你了，" 真嗣向他的妻子恳求道，希望她能帮他解决这个局面。幸运的是，过了一会儿，明日香决定可怜他，她的目光转回他身上，然后翻了个白眼，走到他身边，在他耳边低语了解决方案。

Upon hearing Asuka's solution, Shinji was wondering why he didn't think of it before and gave a silent thanks to her. He turned back to Aki. "Aki honey, if you come out now we can get ice cream on the way home, ok?"  
听到明日香的解决方案后，真嗣纳闷自己之前怎么没想到，默默地向她表示感谢。他转回对 Aki 说："Aki 宝贝，如果你现在出来，我们回家路上可以买冰淇淋，好吗？"

Once Aki heard that, her eyes lit up but they slowly dimmed as she realised that she had to make a tough choice. She whined like a lost and distressed puppy as she looked back and forth between her parents and the kittens but she ultimately made her choice.  
Aki 一听到这个提议，眼睛立刻亮了起来，但很快又黯淡下去，因为她意识到必须做出一个艰难的选择。她像一只迷路受困的小狗一样呜咽着，来回看着父母和那些小猫，但最终还是做出了选择。

"I'm sorry kitties, I have to go now, I'm gonna get some yummy ice cream! So goodbye Tommy, Scratchy, Fluffy, Momo, Kuro, Moritz and last but not least…Sassy!" Aki exclaimed as the girl lifted her magic hat to reveal the last kitten who was nestled comfortably on top of the girl's hair.  
“对不起，小猫咪们，我现在得走了，我要去吃美味的冰淇淋！所以再见了，汤米、斯克莱奇、弗拉菲、莫莫、库罗、莫里茨，最后但同样重要的是……萨西！”阿基兴奋地说道，女孩举起她的魔法帽，露出藏在女孩头发上舒适蜷缩的最后一只小猫。

'_She already gave them names_?' Asuka and Shinji thought the same thing to both surprise and amazement. They even thought it was adorable when Aki started to give each of the named kittens a goodbye kiss on their tiny heads before reluctantly making a slow crawl out of the display and being scooped up in Asuka's arms.  
“她已经给它们取名字了？”明日香和真嗣同时感到惊讶又惊喜。当阿基开始给每只取了名字的小猫在它们的小脑袋上亲吻告别时，他们甚至觉得这很可爱，然后阿基依依不舍地慢慢爬出展示区，被明日香抱在怀里。

After Shinji apologised to Mr Suzuki for the inconvenience, which the older man waved off knowing that kids would be kids and even giving Doctor Akagi a goodbye, the trio finally made their way out pf the shop. Though not before Aki wanted to say her goodbyes to the animals themselves.  
在真嗣为给铃木先生带来的不便道歉后，这位年长者笑着摆手表示理解孩子们的天性，甚至还向赤城医生道别，三人终于离开了商店。不过在那之前，阿基还想亲自向动物们告别。

"Bye kitties, bye puppies, bye little birdies, bye lizards, bye little whitey, bye big spider and…goodbye phoney bird," Aki said giving the last bird a light glare, still somewhat peeved of the bird's deception before.  
“再见，小猫咪们，再见，小狗们，再见，小鸟们，再见，蜥蜴们，再见，小白，再见，大蜘蛛，还有……再见，骗子鸟。”阿基说着，对最后那只鸟轻轻瞪了一眼，仍对它的欺骗有些不悦。

"Goodbye, goodbye…BAKA!" the parrot replied back to the girl, still using its favourite word much to Shinji's discomfort and annoyance.  
“再见，再见……笨蛋！”鹦鹉回应着女孩，依旧用它最喜欢的词，这让真嗣感到不适和恼火。

With the family now finally out of the store and walking hand in hand towards the nearest ice cream shop, the two parents noticed Aki being gloomy despite the oncoming treat and instantly knew what was the problem.  
一家人终于离开了商店，手牵手走向最近的冰淇淋店，两位家长注意到阿基虽然即将享受甜点，却显得闷闷不乐，立刻明白了问题所在。

"Hey honey, don't be sad ok. We promise that we'll have a pet in the future, ok?" Shinji reassured his daughter but also left it vague as to when exactly they would have a pet. Both he and Asuka agreed that Aki was still a bit young to take responsibility for an animal yet.  
"嘿，宝贝，别难过，好吗？我们保证将来会有宠物的，好吗？" 真嗣安慰着女儿，但也含糊其辞地没有说明具体何时会有宠物。他和明日香都认为，阿基还太小，暂时无法承担照顾动物的责任。

"I know Papa," Aki replied but still somewhat sad that she won't have a pet anytime soon.  
"我知道，爸爸，" 阿基回答道，但仍有些难过，因为她短期内无法拥有宠物。

"So Schätzchen which animals in the store did you like the most?" Asuka asked hoping to brighten her daughter's mood a bit.  
"那么，小宝贝，你最喜欢店里哪些动物呢？" 明日香问道，希望能稍微提振女儿的情绪。

"I liked all of them, even the phoney birdy too, hehe," Aki laughed.  
"我喜欢它们全部，连那只假鸟也是，呵呵，" 亚纪笑着说。

### Chapter 14 The Beach

"Mama! Papa! Everyone! It's the beach! I can see the beach!" Aki cried out energetically as she pressed her face to the van window.  
"妈妈！爸爸！大家！是海滩！我看到海滩了！" 亚纪兴奋地喊着，把脸紧贴在面包车的窗户上。

Everyone present in the big van (rented by Kaji himself) with the Ikari family, Rei, Misato, Kaji, PenPen, Toji, Hikari and Kensuke all smiled and chuckled at the young brown-haired girl's enthusiasm.  
在大货车（由加持自己租的）里，与碇家一起的每个人，包括绫波、美里、加持、PenPen、真治、光和健介，都对着那位年轻的棕发女孩的热情微笑并轻声笑了起来。

It had been more than a month since Shinji and Asuka's wedding, plus their moving out of the Katsuragi apartment and into their new (old) home and everything was turning out smoothly, so much so that when the temperature started to rise even more, despite Japan's already scorching temperatures, the gang all agreed to spend the day at the nearby beach.  
自从真嗣和明日香的婚礼过去了一个多月，加上他们搬出了葛城公寓，住进了他们的新（旧）家，一切进展得非常顺利，以至于尽管日本已经酷热难耐，气温还在不断攀升，大家还是一致同意去附近的沙滩度过这一天。

Upon arriving they found the beachside packed full of people, though luckily Kaji had managed to find a parking space very close to the beach. Once parked and getting their things out of the van they all went down a long flight of steps to the beach, though Aki, being impatient and wanting to run was held back by her mother and Rei by her hands.  
到达时，他们发现海滩上挤满了人，不过幸运的是，加持设法找到了一个离海滩非常近的停车位。停好车并取出物品后，他们沿着长长的阶梯走向海滩，而阿基因为急切想要奔跑，被她的母亲和绫波拉着双手。

"Come on, come on! The beach is right there! Come on!" Aki shouted in excitement.  
“快点，快点！海滩就在那儿！快来！” 明日香兴奋地喊道。

"Man, she is impatient, isn't she," Toji said to Shinji, chuckling at the young girl's excitement.  
“老兄，她可真急啊，不是吗，” 真嗣对绫人说，笑着看向那年轻女孩的兴奋劲儿。

"Well, Aki loves the beach and it has been a while for us. Plus I think Aki is curious about seeing a blue sea," Shinji said.  
“嗯，明日香特别喜欢海滩，我们也好久没来了。而且我觉得明日香对看到蓝色大海挺好奇的，” 真嗣说。

"Dude…was the sea red back…well in that future?" Toji whispered as they neared the bottom of the stairs. In his previous talks with his friend's daughter, Aki had always mentioned a few times visiting a "red sea" which he, Hikari and Kensuke were always baffled about but to get confirmation from Shinji that it wasn't some kid's imagination was a surprise.  
"伙计…海在那未来是红色的吗？" 当他们接近楼梯底部时，冬二低声问道。在与朋友女儿的先前谈话中，明总是提到几次去过"红海"，这让光和健司一直感到困惑，但从真嗣那里得到证实，这并非孩子的想象，确实令人惊讶。

Even more of a confirmation that it was indeed true was the look Shinji had, a variety of emotions before Shinji took a deep sigh. "Yeah you shouldn't ask any more about that, Toji."  
更进一步的确认是真嗣的表情，多种情绪交织，随后真嗣深吸一口气。"是啊，你别再问这个了，冬二。"

Toji knew to not continue probing any further on the subject and simply left it be, knowing how sensitive the whole thing was for his friend. With everyone now on the beach, they found a space perfect for everyone to set up a small changing tent, a large beach umbrella and a large towel to sit on. Once all those were set up it was time for everyone to change into their swimsuits and beach outfits, the girls going first.  
冬二知道不该再继续探究这个话题，便就此打住，明白这对朋友来说有多敏感。大家现在都在海滩上，找到了一个适合所有人搭建更衣帐篷、大遮阳伞和坐垫的地方。一切准备就绪后，大家开始换上泳装和沙滩装，女孩们先开始。

It took a few minutes for the girls to finish changing before they exited the tent, which gave the boys a nice eyeful of their swimsuits. Misato was wearing a one-piece black swimsuit that was suitable for women who were pregnant, yet despite her clearly showing a large dome still looked beautiful and worthy of any current supermodel.  
女孩们花了好几分钟才换好衣服，走出帐篷，让男孩们大饱眼福。美里穿的是一件适合孕妇的黑色连体泳衣，尽管她明显挺着个大肚子，却依然美丽动人，不输给任何当红超模。

Asuka came out in her new red bikini with a white lightweight sleeveless beach jacket along with wearing a sun hat and sunglasses.  
明日香穿着她新买的红色比基尼，外面套了一件白色轻薄的无袖沙滩外套，还戴了顶太阳帽和墨镜。

Rei was wearing a blue bikini with yellow stripes on it, that was picked out for her by Asuka and Misato, otherwise, Rei would have brought and worn her one-piece school swimsuit.  
丽穿的是一件蓝底黄条纹的比基尼，这是明日香和美里为她挑选的，否则她就会带上并穿上她那件学校泳装连体泳衣了。

Hikari was wearing a new all-white bikini while forgoing her two pigtails for a change, letting her hair down on Asuka's advice to her.  
光穿着一件全新的纯白比基尼，放弃了她一贯的双马尾，听从明日香的建议，让头发自然垂下。

And lastly, Aki was wearing a children's one-piece red swimsuit, while she had on a pair of giant swimming goggles and a snorkel strapped around the top of her head.  
最后，阿基穿着一件儿童款红色连体泳衣，头上戴着一副巨大的游泳护目镜和一根固定在头顶的呼吸管。

"You know it's rude to stare boys," Misato's voice broke through to the guys who were all but staring at them and the girls ended up giggling/chuckling at them being caught.  
“你们知道盯着人看是不礼貌的，男孩们。”美里的话打断了那些几乎目不转睛的男生们，女孩们则因为他们的窘态被抓而咯咯笑了起来。

Misato's attitude changed immediately when she looked down at herself and got depressed fast, as expected of a pregnant woman going through mood swings.  
当美里低头看向自己时，她的态度立刻发生了变化，很快就陷入了沮丧，不愧是经历情绪波动的孕妇。

"Jesus Christ, I look ridiculous in this thing. I look so fat like a damn beach whale," Misato started getting very emotional to the point of tears which Kaji, having been advised by Shinji on situations like this beforehand, quickly went to hug his fiancée and soothing her with words of encouragement.  
“天哪，我穿这身太滑稽了。我看起来胖得像个该死的海滩鲸鱼，”美里开始变得非常情绪化，甚至快要哭出来，而加持在事先得到真嗣关于这种情况的建议后，迅速拥抱了他的未婚妻，并用鼓励的话语安慰她。

While this was going on, Hikari's eyes met with Toji's, who was looking at her intensely with a bit of a blush on his face before she decided to ask him what he thought of her current attire.  
在这期间，光的眼神与冬二相遇，他正带着些许脸红深情地看着她，于是她决定问问他对自己当前装扮的看法。

"Em…Suzu…I mean Toji, do I look good, I mean do you like my new swimsuit?" Hikari sheepishly asked her boyfriend. In all honesty, she was unsure if this was the right kind of swimsuit for her, but she had asked Asuka and even Miss Katsuragi for advice on how to attract Toji's undivided attention for this trip, which got her mixed looks and reactions from the two, Asuka's being both of disgust and annoyance while Miss Katsuragi's was that of a teasing and grinning one.  
“呃…铃…我是说，阿守，我看起来怎么样，我是说，你喜欢我的新泳衣吗？”光子羞涩地问她的男朋友。说实话，她不确定这件泳衣是否适合自己，但她曾向明日香甚至葛城小姐寻求过如何在这趟旅行中吸引阿守全部注意力的建议，结果从两人那里得到了复杂的表情和反应，明日香的是既厌恶又恼怒，而葛城小姐则是带着调侃和微笑。

Ultimately Hikari was pointed by both women to this white swimsuit which apparently in their own words would bring out more of her purity and innocence that would surely grab her man's attention.  
最终，两位女士都向光子推荐了这件白色泳衣，据她们所说，这件泳衣能更好地展现她的纯洁和天真，肯定会吸引她的男人的注意。

It was working as Toji couldn't seem to keep his eyes off her. Heck, Toji even had his jaw down for a while before Kensuke, who was next to him, put his jaw back up in his mouth, making the dark-haired jock remember to say something.  
效果确实显著，阿守似乎无法将目光从她身上移开。甚至有那么一会儿，他的下巴都掉了下来，直到旁边的健介帮他合上嘴巴，才让这位黑发运动员想起要说些什么。

"Err…yeah you, you look good, no great even Hikari. The swimsuit looks great, really great and I err…like that it shows off your bellybutton." Toji finished rambling while he looked slightly away in embarrassment.  
"呃…对，就是你，小光，你看起来很好，不，是非常好。这泳装看起来很棒，真的很棒，而且我…喜欢它露出你的肚脐。" 真嗣结结巴巴地说完，有些尴尬地移开了视线。

However, his comment on her exposed belly button made Hikari more self-conscious. "Wha! What about my belly button!?" Hikari cried out in embarrassment while she covered her exposed belly button with her hands in an attempt to block Toji's eyes away from it.  
然而，他对她露出的肚脐的评论让小光更加自我意识过剩。"什么！我的肚脐怎么了！？" 小光羞愤地喊出声，同时用手遮住露出的肚脐，试图挡住真嗣的视线。

"Err…well it looks cute?" Toji answered a bit lamely.  
"呃…嗯，看起来很可爱？" 真嗣有些无力地回答道。

Hikari, from everyone's perspective, looked like she had already got sunburn due to how red-faced she'd become in embarrassment. "You…you pervert!" Hikari shouted as she turned around facing away from Toji, leaving him stunned at such a reaction.  
从大家的角度来看，光就像是因为脸红得太过而像是已经晒伤了一样。“你……你这个变态！”光喊道，转身背对着真嗣，留下他因这样的反应而愣在原地。

"…What did I do?" Toji asked in wonder, generally confused. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see his friend Kensuke who was giving him a disappointed look.  
“……我做了什么吗？”真嗣困惑地问道，感到一头雾水。他感觉到有人拍了拍他的肩膀，转身一看，是他的朋友健介，正用失望的眼神看着他。

"Dude, you could have just said that she was beautiful and left it at that instead of making it weird Toji."  
“哥们，你本可以只说她很美就打住，而不是把它搞得这么奇怪，真嗣。”

"Hey shut up man! At least I've got a girlfriend," Toji fought back with his retort, knowing that being the only single guy among their group was a sore spot for the military enthusiast.  
“嘿，闭嘴吧你！至少我有女朋友，” 真嗣反驳道，他知道在他们这群人中，自己是唯一单身的那位，这对军事迷来说是个痛点。

Kensuke however didn't seem fazed by the jab at his single status and instead grinned. "Not yet I don't. Look around man I've got an entire beach of many single girls and women to choose from,"  
但健介似乎并未被这单身状态的嘲讽所动摇，反而咧嘴一笑。“我还没呢。看看周围，老兄，我有一整片海滩上的单身女孩和女士可供选择，”

Kensuke said with confidence that today would be the day he found a girlfriend for himself.  
健介自信满满地说，仿佛今天就是他找到女朋友的日子。

However, his look of confidence wavered as he saw many of the teenage girls on the beach accompanied by guys. "…I mean there's got to be a bunch of single girls out there…right?"  
然而，当他看到海滩上许多少女都有男生陪伴时，他那自信的神情开始动摇。“……我是说，外面肯定还有不少单身女孩吧……对吧？”

The only response he got was both Toji and Shinji patting his shoulders.  
他得到的唯一回应是真治和真嗣拍了拍他的肩膀。

"Well, if they are out there, then good luck Kensuke," Shinji said.  
“好吧，如果她们真的在那儿，那么祝你好运，健介，”真嗣说道。

"Yeah, good luck to ya man, though a piece of advice in case you do meet a girl, don't talk about military stuff. It will go a long way," Toji added before he pushed his friend to start walking along the beach, Kensuke took some unsteady steps before gaining a confident stride.  
“是啊，祝你好运，伙计，不过给你个建议，万一你真遇到个女孩，别聊军事话题。这会大有帮助，” 冬二在他朋友开始沿着海滩走时补充道，真嗣推了他一把，让他在不稳的步伐中逐渐找到了自信的步伐。

Just as Kensuke was out of earshot, Toji turned to Shinji. "So…do you think he's got any chance out there, Shinji?"  
就在真嗣听不到的地方，冬二转向了真希。“那么…你觉得他在外面有机会吗，真希？”

"Well, I mean, it is possible," Shinji shrugged though he did hope that his spectacled friend would at least find someone for himself.  
“嗯，我是说，有可能吧，” 真希耸了耸肩，尽管他确实希望他的戴眼镜的朋友至少能找到一个人。

Aki, who was getting tired and impatient at just standing around with the grownups saw an opportunity to just run towards the sea, but just as she moved to dash to the water she was swiftly caught by her underarms by her mother.  
阿基，站在大人中间已经感到疲惫和不耐烦，看到一个可以直奔大海的机会，但就在她准备冲向水边时，被母亲迅速地从腋下抓住了。

"Oh no you don't, Schätzchen, not yet!" Asuka firmly told her impatient daughter.  
“哦，不行，小宝贝，现在还不行！”明日香坚定地告诉她急不可耐的女儿。

"Aww, but Mama! The sea, the SEA!" Aki whined loudly as she pointed to the sea filled with other people in the water.  
“哎呀，但是妈妈！大海，是大海啊！”阿基大声抱怨着，指着满是人在水中嬉戏的海面。

"Nein, Schätzchen we need to put some sunscreen on you first. You don't wanna get burned now do you?" Asuka told her impatient child as she got out the sunscreen, applying some of the white cream onto her hand before rubbing it into her other free hand once she put the bottle down.  
"不，宝贝，我们得先给你涂点防晒霜。你不想被晒伤吧，对吗？" 明日香一边告诉她急躁的孩子，一边拿出防晒霜，将一些白色乳液挤在手上，然后放下瓶子，用另一只空着的手揉搓。

Aki grumbled and pouted but didn't resist when her mother applied the sunscreen to her exposed face, arms and legs. Next to her Rei was also applying some sunscreen too.  
阿基嘟囔着，噘着嘴，但当母亲给她裸露的脸、手臂和腿涂上防晒霜时，她并没有反抗。旁边的丽也在涂防晒霜。

"Ok, there you go Schätzchen, all set, but remember what we told you, ok?" Asuka questioned her daughter, hoping that she memorised the rules they told her before coming here.  
"好了，宝贝，都准备好了，但记得我们告诉你的，好吗？" 明日香问她的女儿，希望她记住来这里之前他们告诉她的规则。

"I remember Mama." Aki groaned out, remembering that her parents told her the rules of the beach which were many like, stay within sight, don't go into the water alone with at least one of the group with her, don't bother other people or even talk to strangers, etc.  
“我记得妈妈的话。”阿基呻吟着回忆起父母告诉她的海滩规则，比如，保持在视线范围内，不要独自下水，至少要有一个同伴陪同，不要打扰别人，甚至不要和陌生人交谈等等。

Giving the go-ahead Aki bolted to the water nearly bumping into many of the other beach-goers till she finally reached the water, where she squealed in delight as her feet touched cool water before backing away as the water receded.  
得到许可后，阿基飞奔向海水，差点撞到许多其他海滩游客，直到她终于到达水边，当她的脚触碰到清凉的海水时，她高兴地尖叫起来，然后又随着海水的退去而退后。

Seeing this made Asuka smile, but she also saw that Rei was moving to meet up with her daughter.  
这一幕让明日香微笑，但她同时也看到丽正走向她的女儿。

"Rei," Asuka called out to which the blue-haired teen stopped and slightly turned her head back.  
"丽," 明日香呼唤道，蓝发少女停下脚步，微微回头。

"Watch over her for me, please?" Asuka asked honestly.  
"请帮我照顾她，好吗？" 明日香诚恳地请求。

"Understood," was all that Rei said before continuing towards her little friend, who was now knee-deep in the water.  
"明白了，" 丽只说了这一句，便继续向她的小朋友走去，那孩子此刻已站在水中，水深及膝。

Knowing that her little sunshine was in safe hands with Rei, Asuka turned to look at Shinji who was still conversing with Toji. An idea came into her head to which she smirked.  
得知她的小太阳丽在丽的手中安然无恙，明日香转向还在与东治交谈的真嗣。一个念头闪过她的脑海，她不禁微微一笑。

"Oh, Shinjiii..." Asuka called out in an overly sweetening tone, to which Shinji turned back to find that Asuka was now sitting down comfortably on the beach towel on the ground. He almost missed catching the sunscreen bottle that she casually chucked at him.  
“哦，真嗣——”明日香用过分甜腻的语气喊道，真嗣回头发现明日香正舒适地坐在地上的沙滩巾上。她随手扔来的防晒霜瓶子，他差点没接住。

"Can you be a dear good husband and help put that hot thick cream all over my body, please," Asuka said teasingly with a smirk as she lay down on her front. Her smirk broadened when she saw that Shinji's face lit up bright red from the blushing.  
“亲爱的，你能帮我个忙，把那热乎乎的厚厚乳霜涂满我的全身吗？”明日香调侃地说道，一边趴下，一边带着狡黠的微笑。看到真嗣的脸因羞涩而变得通红，她的笑容更灿烂了。

"Asuka, don't say it like that," Shinji said embarrassed as he walked over and kneeled beside Asuka to do as she wanted. "At least till later ok," Shinji whispered the last part in Asuka's ear which made her blush heavy and even made her giggle in excitement like an actual schoolgirl.  
“明日香，别那样说，”真嗣尴尬地说道，他走过去跪在明日香旁边，按照她的要求去做。“至少等会儿再说，好吗？”真嗣在明日香耳边低语，这让她脸颊通红，甚至兴奋得像个小女生一样咯咯笑了起来。

While the two were having a romantic moment, the others watching them were giving them a variety of mixed stares and feelings. Hikari especially looked at the two in what could be described as extreme embarrassment, anger and even a tint of envy.  
当两人沉浸在浪漫时刻时，旁观者们投来了各种复杂的目光和情感。特别是光，她看着这对情侣，脸上流露出极度的尴尬、愤怒，甚至还有一丝嫉妒。

"That, that's so sinful!" Hikari cried out as she pointed her finger accusingly at her best friend and husband.  
“那，那太罪恶了！”光哭喊着，用手指责备地指向她最好的朋友和丈夫。

"Oh come on, grow up, we're officially married," Asuka reminded not only her friend but everyone else in their group as Shinji started applying the sunscreen on her.  
"哎呀，成熟点吧，我们可是正式结婚了，" 明日香不仅提醒她的朋友，也提醒了他们小组中的每个人，因为真嗣开始在她身上涂抹防晒霜。

"A fact that scares me," Toji stated which earned him being hit in the head with the sunscreen bottle Asuka threw at him for that snarky comment.  
"这个事实让我害怕，" 冬二说道，结果被明日香扔来的防晒霜瓶子砸中了头，作为他那刻薄评论的回应。

x-x-x

"Papa, Papa! Come quick! Look, look what I found!" Aki cried out to her father as she saw him approaching her and Rei. They were in the shallow waters on the beach near some rocks and had been swimming around there for nearly half an hour.  
"爸爸，爸爸！快来！看，看我找到了什么！" 阿基向她的父亲喊道，当她看到他和绫波走近时。他们当时在海边靠近岩石的浅水区，已经在那里游泳将近半小时了。

"What is it, honey?" Shinji asked while smiling, wondering what his daughter had found to pique her interest.  
"怎么了，宝贝？" 真嗣微笑着问道，好奇女儿发现了什么引起了她的兴趣。

"I found this!" Aki presented her findings in her open hands with excitement. However, what Aki held in her small hands made Shinji freeze up and face turn pale.  
"我找到了这个！" 阿基兴奋地用摊开的双手展示她的发现。然而，阿基那双小手中所握之物让真嗣僵住了，脸色变得苍白。

"Um…Aki, Rei…what is that?" Shinji asked the two girls as he pointed at what was in his daughter's hands. At first, Shinji just assumed that his daughter had found something normal, like a fish, a crab, a seashell or just anything harmless, but what he was looking at definitely wasn't normal.  
"呃……阿基，丽……那是什么？" 真嗣指着女儿手中的东西问两位女孩。起初，真嗣以为女儿只是找到了一些普通的东西，比如鱼、螃蟹、贝壳或者任何无害的东西，但他眼前所见显然非同寻常。

It looked like a tiny lizard but it had eyes that looked like those of a fish, didn't have arms as far as Shinji could tell, had an unnaturally long tail that was sticking up and had a tint of red at the tip, had a row of gills along its long neck, had some undeveloped dorsal plates along its back and lastly, its whole body was a sticky yellowish complexion.  
它看起来像只小蜥蜴，但眼睛却像鱼的，至少在真嗣看来没有手臂，尾巴异常地长，末端带点红色，脖子上有一排鳃，背上有一些未发育的背板，全身则是黏糊糊的黄褐色。

Aki shrugged her shoulders at the question as she looked back at the creature in her hands, which strangely was also staring back at the little girl who held him. When Shinji turned to Rei, she shook her head negatively at him which surprised him a bit. He knew that Rei was very knowledgeable at almost anything, so her not knowing what type of creature was concerning.  
对于这个问题，阿基耸了耸肩，回头看着她手中的生物，奇怪的是，它也在盯着握着它的小女孩。当真嗣转向绫波时，她对他摇了摇头，这让他有点惊讶。他知道绫波几乎无所不知，所以她不知道这是什么生物让他有些担忧。

"Err…Aki, honey, maybe you should put that back where you found it, ok?" Shinji said cautiously, really hoping that the tiny creature wasn't dangerous in any way. For all he knew the creature might bite, given that Shinji could tell that the strange creature did indeed have teeth and it could be poisonous or even have diseases too.  
“呃……阿基，亲爱的，也许你应该把它放回原处，好吗？”真嗣谨慎地说道，真心希望这个小生物没有任何危险。他知道这生物可能有牙齿，可能会咬人，甚至可能有毒或有疾病。

Aki however wasn't having it as she quickly turned to her side while also shielding the small creature when Shinji tried to reach it with his hands. "No."  
然而，秋并不买账，她迅速转向一边，同时用身体护住那小生物，当真嗣试图用手去抓时。“不行。”

Shinji sighed as he knew this was going to be a battle of wills again. "Aki, we need to put that back where you found it now," Shinji said a bit more firmly hoping to end this immediately.  
真嗣叹了口气，他知道这又将是一场意志的较量。“秋，我们需要把它放回你找到它的地方。”真嗣语气更加坚定，希望能立刻结束这场争执。

"No way Papa, I like him and I'm gonna call him…err…oh "Silly", because he looks silly," Aki proclaimed happily. "See he likes it too!" Aki said as she noticed that the creature now dubbed Silly was looking up at Aki while it was also wagging its long strange tail like a happy dog.  
“不可能，爸爸，我喜欢他，我要叫他……呃……哦，‘傻乎乎’，因为他看起来傻乎乎的。”秋开心地宣布。“看，他也喜欢！”秋注意到被她称为“傻乎乎”的生物正抬头看着她，长长的奇怪尾巴像只快乐的小狗一样摇摆着。

"Yay! We're going to have so much fun, Silly, and have such the best of times and…err Silly?" Aki said who was happy a second ago was now confused as Silly was no longer in her hands, as the excited movements during her happy rant caused the small creature to drop from her open hands and into the water.  
"耶！我们会有很多乐趣的，小傻瓜，会有最美好的时光，还有……呃，小傻瓜？" 刚才还兴高采烈的亚纪现在一脸困惑，因为她在兴奋地喋喋不休时，激动的手舞足蹈让小家伙从她张开的手中滑落，掉进了水里。

"OH NO! Silly, Silly, where are you!" Aki called out to the creature, even putting on her goggles and dipping her head underneath the water to see if she could find the strange creature.  
"哦不！小傻瓜，小傻瓜，你在哪儿！" 亚纪呼唤着小家伙，甚至戴上了她的护目镜，把头潜入水下，试图找到那个奇怪的小生物。

Even after desperately searching, Aki sadly still did not find Silly. "Aww…I lost a friend," Aki sadly mumbled.  
尽管拼命寻找，亚纪还是伤心地没有找到小傻瓜。"呜……我失去了一个朋友，" 亚纪难过地喃喃自语。

Shinji, despite being relieved that the strange creature was gone and thankful that he didn't have to fight his daughter further to leave, still went to comfort his distressed daughter by stroking her head. Rei also comforted Aki by putting her hand on the girl's shoulder.  
尽管那奇怪的生物已经消失，真嗣松了一口气，也不必再与女儿继续战斗以离开，但他仍然走过去抚摸着女儿的头，安慰她。丽也通过把手放在女孩的肩膀上来安慰明。

"I'm sorry about Silly, honey, but this is perhaps for the best. Like we don't know if Silly could have survived away from the sea." Shinji comforted his daughter. Still seeing her with a sad expression Shinji remembered the reason he came out to Aki and Rei. "Come on honey, it's lunchtime and everyone's just about to eat," Shinji finished saying, hoping that food would change the mood.  
“对不起，亲爱的，关于小傻的事，但也许这样最好。我们不知道小傻离开海洋是否能生存。”真嗣安慰着女儿。看到她仍然面带悲伤，真嗣想起了他来找明和丽的初衷。“来吧，亲爱的，午饭时间到了，大家都要吃饭了，”真嗣说完，希望食物能改变气氛。

Fortunately for him, Aki's eyes lit up at the mention of lunch. "Yay! It's lunchtime!" Aki cried out as she made a mad rush out of the shallow water to back to their group's spot at the beach already forgotten about Silly. Seeing this made Shinji chuckle and Rei smile.  
幸运的是，一提到午饭，明的眼睛就亮了起来。“耶！午饭时间到了！”明欢呼着，从浅水中冲出来，直奔他们在海滩上的位置，完全忘记了小傻的事。看到这一幕，真嗣轻声笑了出来，丽也露出了微笑。

By the time Shinji and Rei caught up with the hyperactive child, they saw that Asuka was drying off Aki with her beach towel while Kaji was unpacking their lunches out of the beach bag.  
当真嗣和绫波追上那个精力旺盛的孩子时，他们看到明日香正用她的沙滩毛巾给阿基擦干，而加持则在从沙滩包里取出他们的午餐。

"Ok everyone, lunch is coming right up people, but the first order is for our lovely and impatient little lady, Aki-chan," Kaji said as he handed Aki her bento box, which Aki quickly snatched out of the old spy's hand.  
“好了，各位，午餐马上就来，但第一个订单是给我们可爱又急切的小女士，阿基酱的，”加持说着，递给阿基她的便当盒，阿基迅速从这位老间谍手中抢了过去。

"Thank you, Mr. Kaji!" Aki thanked the older unshaven man, having remembered her manners.  
“谢谢你，加持先生！”阿基向那位留着胡茬的年长男子道谢，记得要保持礼貌。

As everyone was being handed their lunches by Kaji, Aki, hungry and impatient quickly unwrapped her bento and opened the contents with some added rice balls.  
当每个人都从 Kaji 那里接过午餐时，饥饿且不耐烦的 Aki 迅速解开她的便当，打开盖子，里面还额外放了几个饭团。

"Thank you for the food!" Aki shouted out happily as she held the rice ball in her hand and was about to bite into it but felt a rush of wind and something snatched the rice ball from her fingers.  
“谢谢款待！”Aki 开心地大喊，她手里拿着一个饭团，正要咬下去，却突然感到一阵风，有什么东西从她手指间抢走了饭团。

Confused for a second Aki looked around for the rice ball thinking that it might have fallen on the ground but heard the sounds of a seagull from up above and looked up to see that the bird held her rice ball in his mouth as it was flying away.  
Aki 一时困惑，四处寻找饭团，以为它可能掉在了地上，但随即听到上方传来海鸥的叫声，抬头一看，只见那只鸟嘴里叼着她的饭团，正飞离而去。

"Hey! Mr Seagull, come back! COME BACK AND GIVE BACK MY FOOD!" Aki shouted at the bird.  
"嘿！海鸥先生，回来！回来把我的食物还给我！" 阿基对着那只鸟喊道。

x-x-x

"Baka seagull," Aki grumbled angrily as she continued to build her sandcastle alongside Rei next to her doing the same, all the while occasionally looking at any passing seagulls, flying or walking around near other beach-goers with a glare.  
"笨蛋海鸥，" 阿基一边生气地咕哝着，一边继续和旁边的丽一起建造沙堡，同时不时地用凶狠的目光盯着任何飞过或漫步在其他海滩游客附近的海鸥。

Lunch had finished nearly an hour ago, but Aki was still angry over the fact that a seagull had stolen one piece of her food. Her Mama, Papa and everyone thought it was a funny moment but once Aki started having a small tantrum, they quickly calmed Aki down by telling her that they would treat her to either ice cream or a crepe later from one of the food vendors on the beach.  
午餐已经结束近一个小时了，但阿基仍然对一只海鸥偷走了她的一块食物感到愤怒。她的妈妈、爸爸和所有人都认为这是一个有趣的瞬间，但当阿基开始有点发脾气时，他们迅速安抚她，告诉她稍后会带她去海滩上的食品摊买冰淇淋或可丽饼。

Yet despite that promise of more food, Aki's hatred of the seagulls remained and as she was about to call another seagull Baka as she was building another tower out of sand, Aki gasped as she saw a tiny crab scuttling along.  
尽管有更多食物的承诺，亚纪对海鸥的厌恶依旧未减。正当她准备再次用沙子堆砌一座塔，并打算称呼另一只海鸥为“笨蛋”时，她突然倒吸一口气，因为她看到了一只小螃蟹正匆匆爬过。

"Hi, Mr. Crab!" Aki said as she moved towards the crustacean before crouching down to see the tiny creature. Upon coming closer the crab stopped moving and appeared to look unblinkingly at the towering girl.  
“嗨，螃蟹先生！”亚纪说着，向那只甲壳动物走去，然后蹲下来仔细观察这个小家伙。靠近后，螃蟹停止了移动，似乎目不转睛地盯着眼前这个高大的女孩。

"Hey, Mr. Crab! Do you want to live in my sandcastle?" Aki asked the tiny crustacean.  
“嘿，螃蟹先生！你想住进我的沙堡吗？”亚纪向那只小螃蟹问道。

The crab just stayed still while seemingly looking up at the human girl unblinkingly, to which Aki did the same, looking down at it and waiting for some response. After a brief moment, the staring contest was broken when the crab resumed scuttling along the beach.  
那只螃蟹只是静静地待着，仿佛目不转睛地仰望着眼前的人类女孩，而秋也同样低头凝视着它，等待着某种回应。片刻之后，当螃蟹重新沿着海滩爬行时，这场对视比赛便被打破了。

"Oh…ok, bye Mr. Crab!" Aki waved to the crab before resuming building her sandcastle.  
“哦……好吧，再见，螃蟹先生！”秋向螃蟹挥了挥手，然后继续建造她的沙堡。

"And there I'm finished!" Aki declared as she finally finished her sandcastle. "Mama, Papa! Look I'm done with my castle!"  
“我终于完成了！”秋宣布道，她终于完成了她的沙堡。“妈妈，爸爸！看，我的城堡建好了！”

Hearing their daughter calling them, Asuka and Shinji got up from their towels to take a look at Aki's creation, which wasn't all that grand or even remotely spectacular given it was just a sand structure made in four cone shape buildings on each side, but it was something that their little girl created herself.  
听到女儿呼唤他们，明日香和真嗣从毛巾上起身，去看小爱创作的作品。虽然那不过是在每边堆了四个圆锥形建筑的沙子结构，既不宏伟也不特别引人注目，但这是他们的小女儿亲手创造的。

"That looks great honey," Shinji said to his daughter as he kneeled to inspect the sandcastle himself while also ruffling Aki's brown locks.  
“看起来很棒，亲爱的，”真嗣对女儿说，他跪下来仔细观察这座沙堡，同时揉乱了小爱的棕色头发。

"Yeah, it's great Schätzchen," Asuka added praising her daughter.  
“是啊，很棒，小宝贝，”明日香补充道，称赞她的女儿。

"It is right! Rei, look I finished my sandcastle! Do you like it?" Aki called out to her friend who the trio saw was in the middle of building her sandcastle or in this case a completely smooth pyramid made out of sand.  
“没错！丽，看我建好了我的沙堡！你喜欢吗？” 阿基向她的朋友喊道，三人看到她正在建造她的沙堡，或者更确切地说，是用沙子堆成的完全平滑的金字塔。

Rei looked to Aki, before looking at her unremarkable sandcastle which after a brief moment she nodded and smiled at the young girl. "It's very well made."  
丽看向阿基，然后看向她那平凡无奇的沙堡，片刻之后，她点了点头，对小女孩微笑道：“建得非常好。”

Just as Aki was about to cheer happily for her friend's praise, everyone noticed that a crowd of people were gathering near the edge of the water, apparently seeing something spectacular happening on the water.  
就在阿基准备为朋友的夸奖而高兴欢呼时，大家都注意到一群人正聚集在水边，显然是在水上看到了什么壮观的事情。

"Wait a minute, is that a bird?"

"Dude is that thing riding an actual surfboard?  
"哥们，那东西真的是在冲浪板上吗？

"Is this for real or is this a joke?"  
"这是真的还是开玩笑的？"

"Wow, that bird got some mad skills!"  
"哇，那只鸟的技能真是厉害！"

"Wait a minute, IS THAT MY SURFBOARD!?"  
"等一下，那不是我的冲浪板吗？！"

Aki, wanting to see what was going on, got up and ran into the crowd quickly followed by Asuka, Shinji and Rei. Upon being able to squeeze past the mass of people and get to the front to see what the commotion was, Aki's eyes lit up as she recognised what or more accurately who was riding a surfboard on the water high wave on the sea.  
阿基想知道发生了什么，起身迅速跑向人群，明日香、真嗣和丽紧随其后。当她能够挤过人群，到达前排看到骚动的原因时，阿基的眼睛一亮，她认出了在水面上驾驭着巨浪冲浪的人，准确地说，是那只冲浪的企鹅。

"Mama, Papa, Rei, everyone! Look it's PenPen!" Aki shouted as she pointed out to where PenPen was.  
"妈妈，爸爸，丽，大家快看！是 PenPen！" 阿基指着 PenPen 所在的地方喊道。

"Wait…WHAT!?" Asuka and Shinji shouted in disbelief after they had managed to squeeze in front of the crowd and stand alongside Aki, along with Rei who looked stoic at the scene, as everybody watched PenPen riding on a surfboard and looking like a professional surfer as he rode the high waves.  
"等等……什么！？" 明日香和真嗣挤到人群前，站在阿基旁边，还有表情冷漠的绫波零，大家都看着 PenPen 站在冲浪板上，像专业冲浪手一样驾驭着高浪。

"YAY! Go PenPen!" Aki cheered, which got the crowd of people cheering on too.  
"耶！PenPen 加油！" 阿基欢呼道，人群也随之欢呼起来。

"YEAH! GO LITTLE BIRD!" a group of people cheered loudly, edging on the penguin too. The crowd even gasped when PenPen seemingly vanished underneath a huge wave, fearing for the little guy's safety but then cheered loudly when he reappeared at the end of the wave unharmed and still on the board.  
"耶！小鸟加油！" 一群人大声欢呼，为企鹅加油。当 PenPen 似乎消失在巨浪下时，人群甚至倒吸一口凉气，担心这个小家伙的安全，但当他毫发无损地在浪尖重新出现并仍在板上时，大家又大声欢呼起来。

The crowd continued to cheer and clap as PenPen made it to shore. The small bird basked in the cheers and admiration of the crowd, especially a group of women who started to gather and circle him, some even went to pet him after some hesitation.  
人群继续欢呼鼓掌，当 PenPen 抵达岸边时。这只小鸟沐浴在人群的欢呼和赞赏中，尤其是一些女性开始聚集并围着他，有些人甚至在犹豫后上前抚摸他。

Just as PenPen was enjoying the attention of the women, PenPen was surprised when he was grabbed and held by none other than Aki, much to his anger and disappointment, obviously wishing it was one of the older mature girls surrounding him.  
正当 PenPen 享受着女性的关注时，他被 Aki 突然抓住并抱起，这让 PenPen 既愤怒又失望，显然他更希望是被周围那些成熟的大姐姐们中的一员抱起。

"That was amazing PenPen!" Aki cried out as she continued to squeeze the small bird in her grasp. "I love you!"  
“太棒了，PenPen！”Aki 喊道，同时继续紧握着小鸟。“我爱你！”

"WARK, WARK!" PenPen cried out in displeasure while also trying to break free from the brown-haired girl's hold on him, once again cursing the little terror for ruining his moment, especially to the beautiful women who were now all awe at the cute sight.  
"哇克，哇克！" 企鹅 PenPen 不满地叫着，试图挣脱棕发女孩的束缚，再次咒骂这个小恶魔毁了他的时刻，尤其是让那些美丽的女士们现在都对着这可爱的景象惊叹不已。

x-x-x

"Ok Aki-chan, are you ready?" Kaji called out loud to the little girl.  
"好了，Aki 酱，准备好了吗？" Kaji 大声向小女孩喊道。

"I'm ready!" Aki cheerfully and over-excitedly replied to the former spy as she was placed in the right position, her tiny hands holding a wooden stick as well as having her eyes covered by a blindfold by her Mama and Papa for the game to begin.  
"我准备好了！" Aki 兴高采烈地回应着前间谍，她被安置在正确的位置，小小的手里握着一根木棍，眼睛被妈妈和爸爸用眼罩蒙上，游戏即将开始。

The said game was none other than splitting the watermelon. A few minutes before Kaji had asked the others if they wanted to play the game given that he brought a few fully grown watermelons along. After explaining the game to Aki after her confusion about what it was, the brown-haired girl was overly excited to play it and wanted to be the first to give it a go.  
所说的游戏正是劈西瓜。几分钟前，Kaji 询问其他人是否想玩这个游戏，因为他带了几个成熟的大西瓜。在向 Aki 解释游戏规则后，这位棕色头发的女孩对游戏异常兴奋，迫不及待地想要第一个尝试。

"Ok, here we go, one, two, three!" Asuka and Shinji spun around their daughter three times before moving slightly to the side with the others. Aki giggled from the slight dazed from being spun and nearly fell over but regained her footing. Now she needed to find and splat that watermelon.  
“好，我们开始，一、二、三！”Asuka 和 Shinji 将他们的女儿转了三圈，然后与其他人一起稍微移到一旁。Aki 因旋转而略感眩晕，咯咯笑着，差点摔倒但稳住了脚步。现在她需要找到并击中那个西瓜。

"Aki! Turn around honey, you are going the other way!" Shinji called out as he watched Aki going way off from her target.  
“Aki！转过身来，亲爱的，你走错方向了！”Shinji 喊道，看着 Aki 偏离目标越来越远。

"Yes, yes, that's the right way Schätzchen! Just keep moving slowly forward that way," Asuka called out as well.  
“对对，就是这样，小宝贝！就这样慢慢往前走。”明日香也喊道。

"Oh Aki-Chan, you're going off course! You need to go slightly to the left!" Hikari added her help when she saw Aki was beginning to venture away to the right, away from the melon.  
“哦，秋酱，你偏了！需要稍微往左一点！”当看到秋开始向右偏离西瓜时，希卡利补充道。

"No no, Aki-Chan, that's right, you need to go left, LEFT!" Misato who was watching from her comfortable beach chair, got into the fun.  
“不不，秋酱，对了，你需要往左，往左！”坐在舒适的沙滩椅上观看的美里也加入了乐趣。

"Yeah, that's it Aki-Chan! You're nearly there!" Toji cheered the girl on.  
“对，就是这样，Aki 酱！你快到了！” 冬二为女孩加油鼓劲。

"Ok kid, just a few tiny more steps and…stop you're there!" Kaji helped the girl finally reach her target.  
“好了，孩子，再走几小步就……停，到了！” 加持帮助女孩终于到达了目标。

"Ok Schätzchen, smash that melon!" Asuka! called out to her daughter.  
“好嘞，宝贝，砸烂那个瓜！” 明日香向她的女儿喊道。

Trusting her mama, Aki tightened her grip on the wooden stick before preparing to strike at it.  
信任着妈妈，Aki 紧握住木棍，准备向它发起攻击。

"HI..YA!" Aki cried out as she put all of her strength into smashing the watermelon.  
“嗨呀！”Aki 大喊一声，全力以赴地砸向西瓜。

Unfortunately for Aki, nothing happened to the watermelon as her supposed mighty strike simply bounced off of it.  
不幸的是，对于 Aki 来说，西瓜毫发无损，她那自以为强大的攻击只是轻轻弹开了。

"Did I do it!?" Aki called out as she took off the blindfold but was disappointed to see no damage to the melon. Not wanting to give up Aki then struck the melon again with the stick but only got frustrated when again there was no damage to it. Getting even madder Aki just kept striking the watermelon.  
"我成功了吗？" 亚纪摘下眼罩，却失望地发现西瓜毫发无损。不甘心放弃的她再次用棍子击打西瓜，但又一次无功而返，这让她更加沮丧。愤怒之下，亚纪不停地敲打着西瓜。

Everyone from the side just watched in funny amusement at seeing Aki repeatedly hitting the watermelon.  
旁观的人们只是有趣地看着亚纪一次次地敲打西瓜，脸上露出好笑的表情。

"Haha I guess Aki-Chan isn't that strong yet," Kaji said.  
"哈哈，看来亚纪酱还不够强啊，" 卡吉说道。

"Or maybe Kaji the watermelon is too thick and hard to begin with," Asuka replied to the older unshaven man. "Did you overwater them?" Asuka asked, vaguely remembering something about how to handle watermelons from her years of gardening.  
"或许卡吉这个西瓜本身就皮厚肉硬吧，" 明日香回答那位年长且未刮胡子的男人。"你是不是浇水过多了？" 明日香问道，隐约记得从多年园艺经验中学到的一些关于如何处理西瓜的知识。

"Oh boy, she's definitely not happy now," Shinji sighed as he continued to watch his daughter go into an angry frenzy over the watermelon.  
"哦天哪，她现在肯定很不高兴，" 真嗣叹息着，继续观察他的女儿因西瓜而陷入愤怒的狂暴之中。

"Well, she's doing a bit of damage…I think?" Toji replied to his friend. He squinted his eyes to see that Aki was doing a bit of damage to the outer shell but not enough to penetrate or break the thing together.  
"嗯，她确实造成了些许破坏…我猜？" 冬二回答他的朋友。他眯起眼睛看到，阿基正在对西瓜的外壳造成一些损伤，但还不足以穿透或完全破坏它。

Misato, having had her fun watching seeing the scene decided to help her "niece". "Hey Aki-Chan!"  
美里看着这一幕玩得开心，决定帮帮她的“侄女”。“嘿，秋酱！”

"WHAT!" Aki angrily called back, still not stopping her attacks.  
“什么！” 秋生气地回应，攻击仍未停下。

"Use the stick to stab the melon instead of striking it, ok hun?" Misato said.  
“用棍子刺西瓜而不是敲打它，好吗，亲爱的？”美里说道。

Aki stopped her attempts, taking in her auntie's words before manoeuvring the wooden stick downward and stabbing it down, which finally penetrated the watermelon.  
阿基停止了尝试，先消化了阿姨的话，然后将木棍向下移动，用力一刺，终于穿透了西瓜。

"YAY! I did, I did it!" Aki cried out happily and continued to stab the melon till it was now reduced to chunks of pieces.  
“耶！我做到了，我真的做到了！”阿基高兴地喊道，继续刺着西瓜，直到它变成了一块块碎片。

"Ok, next it's Ayanami's turn," Kaji said already preparing the next melon.  
“好了，接下来轮到绫波了，”卡吉已经准备好了下一个西瓜。

"Oh oh, I wanna spin Rei around!" Aki quickly forgot her smashed melon and went to Rei's side.  
"哦哦，我想转丽一圈！" 亚纪迅速忘记了被砸碎的瓜，跑到丽身边。

"You ready, Rei?" Aki looked up at her blue-haired friend who had just put on the blindfold and nodded in confirmation.  
"准备好了吗，丽？" 亚纪抬头看着刚刚戴上眼罩的蓝发朋友，对方点头确认。

"Here we go! One, two, three! Go Rei!" Aki cheered for her friend after having spun the teen around.  
"我们开始吧！一、二、三！丽，出发！" 亚纪在转了少女一圈后为朋友加油。

To everyone's surprise, Rei didn't move for a moment before she turned her head in the direction of the watermelon despite not being able to see. She calmly walked over to it without any guidance from everyone and was already next to the melon before rearing back the wooden stick.  
令所有人惊讶的是，丽在转向西瓜方向之前一动不动地站了一会儿，尽管她看不见。她平静地走向西瓜，没有接受任何人的引导，已经在西瓜旁边时才后退一步，举起木棍。

The next thing everyone knew the watermelon burst into nothing but tiny bits due to the force of Rei's strike on it. Everyone on the sidelines now had bits of destroyed melon on them as a result.  
接下来大家看到的是，西瓜在丽的打击下爆裂成无数小碎片。在场边观看的每个人都因此沾上了被摧毁的西瓜碎片。

The only one who didn't seem stunned by what just happened was Aki herself who was cheering and clapping in excitement. "Yay, Rei that was wicked!"  
唯一没有被刚才发生的事情震惊的人是秋，她兴奋地欢呼鼓掌。"太棒了，丽，真厉害！"

x-x-x

It was a bit further in the day, but the sun was still high in the sky and despite having eaten many pieces of watermelon which everyone found out had mixed results as Kaji either under-watered some or gave too much water to them thus making it rather tasteless. Thus everyone agreed to get something at the local food vendor at the beach and Aki still wanted a treat from earlier due to the seagull incident. So going along with it, Shinji took Aki to the nearest one along with Kaji while Misato, Asuka, Rei, Hikari and Toji stayed behind.  
时间稍晚了一些，但太阳依旧高悬天空。尽管之前吃了许多西瓜，结果却参差不齐——Kaji 要么浇水不足，要么浇得太多，导致西瓜变得索然无味。因此，大家一致决定去海滩附近的食品摊买点东西，而 Aki 因为之前的海鸥事件还想再吃点心。于是，Shinji 带着 Aki 和 Kaji 去了最近的摊位，而 Misato、Asuka、Rei、Hikari 和 Toji 则留在了原地。

"Papa! Papa! I want that one!" Aki said what seemed like the tenth time already as she pointed to pictures of the food printed on the side of the vendor stall.  
“爸爸！爸爸！我要那个！”Aki 指着摊位侧面的食物图片，这已经是她第十次这样说了。

"Yes, honey, I know, I know," Shinji sighed as he held Aki's hand, keeping her in place. They were currently behind Kaji who was getting something for Misato. Once Kaji gave the food vendor man his money, he turned around and both Shinji and Aki saw what he had purchased, which was four grilled squid on sticks  
“好的，宝贝，我知道，我知道。”Shinji 叹了口气，握着 Aki 的手，让她站稳。他们现在正站在 Kaji 后面，Kaji 在为 Misato 买东西。Kaji 付完钱后，转身回来，Shinji 和 Aki 看到了他买的东西——四串烤鱿鱼。

"Ewe…that's nasty!" Aki said, grossed out. She still hadn't gotten over the incident ages ago on the fish subject.  
"咦…好恶心！" 阿基说，感到恶心。她还是没能从很久以前关于鱼的那个事件中恢复过来。

"Hey, don't knock it before trying it kid," Kaji chuckled at the little girl's behaviour.  
"嘿，没试过之前别急着否定，小家伙，" 卡吉对小女孩的行为轻声笑道。

"Are all those just for Misato?" Shinji inquired.  
"这些都是给美里小姐的吗？" 真嗣询问道。

"Yep, that's right. She all but demanded I get these. Think she started getting those pregnancy cravings like you warned me about," Kaji said, remembering the tips that Shinji shared with him before.  
“没错，就是这样。她几乎是在命令我买这些。我想她开始有你之前提醒我的那种孕期渴望了，”Kaji 说道，回想起之前 Shinji 给他的建议。

"Yeah, I know," Shinji chuckled lightly before sighing heavily, clearly remembering the time during Asuka's pregnancy when she wanted many unusual or outright strange things to eat. Many of which he couldn't make or find in the ruins of the city which resulted in Asuka's mood worsening many times.  
“是啊，我知道，”Shinji 轻笑一声，随即重重叹了口气，显然是想起了 Asuka 怀孕期间想要吃许多不寻常甚至奇怪的东西。其中很多他都做不出来或是在城市的废墟中找不到，这导致 Asuka 的情绪多次恶化。

Heck, many times Asuka had accompanied him to make sure he wasn't lying or making sure he did a thorough search of places of what she wanted. She once broke into an untouched sweet store and came out with a huge sack full of candy and chocolate before he could attempt to lock pick the entrance. The memory of Asuka devouring her raid of sweets like that of a hungry lion eating its prey was still fresh in his mind.  
天哪，Asuka 多次陪他一起去，确保他没有撒谎或是在她想要的东西上进行了彻底的搜索。她曾闯入一家未被触碰过的糖果店，拿着一大袋糖果和巧克力出来，而他还没来得及尝试撬锁。Asuka 像饿狮吞食猎物一样狼吞虎咽地吃掉那些糖果的情景，至今仍清晰地留在他的记忆中。

"Papa, come on," Aki whined as she was getting impatient of wanting something.  
"爸爸，快点嘛，" 阿基抱怨道，她对想要的东西越来越不耐烦了。

"Ok ok honey," Shinji chuckled and with Kaji walking back, Shinji and Aki were next in line to order.  
"好了好了，亲爱的，" 真嗣轻笑一声，随着加持走回来，真嗣和阿基排到了点餐的队伍中。

"Hello there kids. What can I get you?" The man behind the vendor asked.  
"嘿，孩子们，要点什么？" 摊位后的男子问道。

"I want that with Strawberry!" Aki cried out as she pointed to the picture of a crepe. "Oh err please mister," Aki finished when she felt a slight nudge from her father to remember her manners.  
"我要那个草莓的！" 阿基指着一张可丽饼的图片喊道。"哦，呃，请先生，" 阿基在父亲轻轻提醒她注意礼貌后补充道。

The man chuckled having seen this situation with many kids many times. "Ok one strawberry crepe coming right up, and you young man?" the man asked Shinji.  
那人轻声笑了，他见过许多孩子多次遇到这种情况。"好的，一份草莓可丽饼马上就好，你呢，小伙子？" 那人问真嗣。

"Oh, can I have three shaved ice, please? One strawberry, blueberry and green tea please."  
"哦，请给我来三份刨冰好吗？一份草莓，一份蓝莓和一份绿茶的。"

"Ok coming right up." The vendor man said before getting to work making the orders starting with Aki's order first and it was less than a minute the crepe was given to Aki while Shinji carefully took the three shaved ice in both hands after paying the man.  
"好的，马上就来。" 摊贩老板说道，随即开始制作订单，首先从 Aki 的订单开始。不到一分钟，Aki 就拿到了她的可丽饼，而 Shinji 则小心翼翼地用双手接过三份刨冰，付了钱。

Just as the two were on their way back to their spot on the beach, Aki was happily munching on the crepe, squealing at the taste and sweetness of it. Now back with everyone, Shinji handed two of the shaved ice to Asuka and Rei.  
正当两人返回海滩上的位置时，Aki 开心地啃着可丽饼，对它的味道和甜度发出惊喜的叫声。现在回到大家身边，Shinji 将两份刨冰递给了 Asuka 和 Rei。

"Mama! Look at what I got!" Aki called out to her mother while showing her a treat to her.  
"妈妈！看我拿到了什么！" Aki 向她的母亲喊道，同时向她展示手中的美食。

"Oh wow Schätzchen that looks great," Asuka exaggerated slightly at her daughter's choice for a treat. Giving Shinji a quick look she saw him looking back at her with a tired smile while shrugging his shoulders, already knowing that he was spoiling Aki again with anything she wanted.  
“哦哇，宝贝，看起来真不错，”明日香对女儿挑选的零食略带夸张地称赞道。她迅速瞥了一眼真嗣，只见他回以一个疲惫的微笑，耸了耸肩，显然已经习惯了再次满足阿基的任何要求。

Just as Aki was about to sit down on the beach towel, a loud screeching coming from above from a very familiar seagull was coming close to Aki, preparing to snatch her food again.  
就在阿基准备坐在沙滩巾上时，一只非常熟悉的鸥鸟从上方发出刺耳的叫声，迅速接近阿基，准备再次抢走她的食物。

Before another could register what to do, Rei quickly picked up a tiny seashell beside her and threw it at the descending seagull, which to everyone's shock hit the bird, causing it to fall and crash into the sand next to them before it quickly scampered and flew away from them.  
在其他人还没反应过来该做什么之前，绫波迅速捡起身边的一枚小贝壳，朝俯冲下来的鸥鸟扔去，令所有人震惊的是，贝壳击中了鸟儿，使其坠落并撞在沙地上，随后它迅速扑腾着翅膀飞离了他们。

Still in shock, everyone looked at Rei in awe.  
仍然震惊中，大家都敬畏地看着丽。

"Dude, did she just hit a seagull with a tiny shell?" Toji asked in wonder and disbelief.  
"伙计，她刚刚是用一个小贝壳打中了一只海鸥吗？" 冬二既惊奇又难以置信地问道。

"Yay! Thank you, Rei!" Aki cheered for her friend and was happy that the seagull didn't get her food again.  
"耶！谢谢你，丽！" 明日香为她的朋友欢呼，并庆幸海鸥这次没有抢走她的食物。

x-x-x-x

"Kensuke! Kensuke, where are you man!?" Toji shouted out to his friend as he and Shinji searched for their missing friend who hadn't been seen since the beginning day.  
“健介！健介，你在哪儿，伙计？！” 真嗣和 Shinji 在寻找他们失踪的朋友，自从第一天起就没人见过他。

It was now later in the evening and the sun was nearly setting on the horizon thus a lot of people on the beach were beginning to pick up and leave. The gang, having had their fun for today, decided to do the same. Aki did protest at this at first since she wanted to stay, but Asuka and Shinji had told her that they needed to get going. Of course, for all her protesting, the day full of excitement took its toll and she fell asleep almost immediately after being strapped into her child seat.  
现在已是傍晚时分，太阳几乎要沉入地平线，海滩上的人们开始收拾东西离开。今天玩得尽兴的一行人也决定如此。Aki 起初抗议，因为她想留下来，但 Asuka 和 Shinji 告诉她他们需要离开。当然，尽管她抗议，一整天的兴奋还是让她筋疲力尽，几乎一被系上儿童座椅就睡着了。

The gang were all packing up their remaining stuff into the van, but it occurred to them that they were missing Kensuke, thus his friends began searching for him.  
大家都在把剩下的东西装进货车，但突然意识到健介不见了，于是他的朋友们开始寻找他。

They had been trying to call and search for him for a few minutes now and just as Shinji and Toji were beginning to worry about their friend, they saw someone in the distance running towards them and to their relief it was Kensuke.  
他们已经尝试打电话和寻找他好几分钟了，正当真嗣和渡边开始担心他们的朋友时，他们看到远处有个人朝他们跑来，令他们松了一口气的是，那是健介。

"Hey guys!" Kensuke shouted as he waved his hand while continuing to run towards them.  
“嘿，伙计们！”健介一边挥手一边继续向他们跑来，大声喊道。

Both sighing in relief, Shinji and Toji waited for their friend to reach them, which Kensuke did and was breathing heavily due to the running he did.  
真嗣和渡边都松了一口气，等待着他们的朋友跑过来，健介终于到了，由于跑步而气喘吁吁。

"Finally man, we've been looking all over for you," Toji said.  
“终于找到你了，伙计，”冬二说道。

"Yeah I mean, you've been gone all day, Kensuke," Shinji added. "Like, where have you been all this time?"  
“是啊，我是说，你一整天都不见人影，真嗣补充道。“你到底去哪儿了？”

"Ga..guys…you never…guess…what happened," Kensuke breathed out still trying to catch his breath from the running he did.  
“大……大家……你们绝对猜不到……发生了什么，”健介喘着气说，还在努力平复因奔跑而急促的呼吸。

"What, you found some secret pirate treasure or something?" Toji joked.  
"什么，你找到了什么海盗的秘密宝藏之类的？" 冬二开玩笑道。

"No, I had a date with a girl!" Kensuke cheered happily. His exclamation left both Shinji and Toji stunned and trying to process what exactly he had just said.  
"不，我和一个女孩约会了！" 真希兴奋地欢呼。他的话让真嗣和冬二都愣住了，努力消化他刚刚说的话。

"…No way dude, you pulling our legs here right?" Toji questioned, still not believing that Kensuke managed to find and date a girl in a single day.  
"……不可能吧，兄弟，你在逗我们玩对吧？" 冬二质疑道，仍然不敢相信真希能在一天之内找到并约会一个女孩。

"No, I'm serious guys!" Kensuke said firmly, a bit insulted that his friends didn't believe he could do it. "I went on a date with a cute girl…well kinda," Kensuke finished saying but his last line was somewhat mumbled.  
"不，我是认真的，伙计们！" 真希波坚定地说，有点受伤朋友们不相信他能做到。"我和一个可爱的女孩约会了……算是吧，" 真希波说完，但最后一句话有些含糊。

Unfortunately for him, Shinji and Toji did hear that last part and the latter was giving him a look of scrutiny.  
不幸的是，对于他来说，真嗣和东治确实听到了那最后一句话，后者正用一种审视的目光看着他。

"Ah huh, what do you mean 'kinda', Kensuke?" Toji said while making it sound like an interrogation.  
"啊哈，你说的'算是吧'是什么意思，真希波？" 东治说道，语气听起来像是在审问。

Kensuke sighed as he decided just to tell his friends. "Well, what happened was that I did look around and even dared to ask a few girls on the beach if they wanted to…you know hang out, but I got turned down by all of them. After that, I was feeling down so I just went to the secluded part of the beach down by the rocks when two pretty older girls came up to me and asked if I was alone and single."  
健介叹了口气，决定还是告诉他的朋友们。“好吧，事情是这样的，我确实四处看了看，甚至鼓起勇气问了几个海滩上的女孩是否愿意……你知道的，一起出去玩，但她们都拒绝了我。之后，我感到很沮丧，就去了海边岩石附近比较隐蔽的地方，这时两个漂亮的大姐姐走过来，问我是不是一个人，单身。”

Shinji and Toji gave each other a side glance before looking back to Kensuke. "Wait, wait, wait. You went on a date with two girls!?" Toji said in more disbelief. His mind can't understand how his military nerd friend could pull off something like that.  
真嗣和东治互相交换了一个侧目，然后又看向健介。“等等，等等，等等。你和两个女孩约会了？！”东治更加难以置信地说道。他无法理解他的军事宅朋友是怎么做到这种事的。

"No man there's more to it than that, although it would have been nice if that was the case," Kensuke muttered out the last part, remembering thinking the same thing during that moment.  
“不，事情没那么简单，虽然那样的话确实不错，”健介低声说出最后一部分，回想起当时自己也是这么想的。

"Anyway when I answered, they told me that they needed my help for their friend, who it turned out was incredibly nervous and shy around guys in general. So I was picked because the girl herself picked me out of all the guys here, because I looked the least intimidating to her."  
"总之，当我接电话时，他们告诉我他们需要我帮忙，因为他们的朋友对男生特别紧张和害羞。所以我被选中是因为那个女孩从这里的所有男生中选了我，因为我看起来对她最不具威胁性。"

Shinji and Toji now understood the situation, although Toji just gave a deadpanned look.  
真嗣和渡志现在明白了情况，尽管渡志只是面无表情地看了看。

"So basically you were on a pretend date rather than an actual one."  
"所以基本上你是在假装约会，而不是真的约会。"

"Hey, that's not true!…Well, I mean sure that's what it started out as, but me and Shinobu really got to talking about a bunch of stuff after some awkwardness and she really opened up to me as well. She even told me where she used to live before moving up here, what her favourite things were and that she likes to sing too even though she's too shy to do it around people."  
"嘿，那不是真的！……嗯，我是说，虽然一开始确实是那样，但我和 Shinobu 后来真的聊了很多东西，虽然一开始有点尴尬，但她真的对我敞开了心扉。她甚至告诉我她搬到这里之前住在哪里，她最喜欢的东西是什么，还有她虽然很害羞，但也喜欢唱歌。"

"Wow, it seems you had a great time with this girl, Kensuke," Shinji said, happy that his friend was able to enjoy himself on his so-called "date".  
"哇，看来你和这个女孩玩得很开心啊，Kensuke，" Shinji 说，很高兴他的朋友能在所谓的“约会”中享受自己。"

"Yeah, too bad that it was a one-time thing and you'll never see the girl again man," Toji added, still sceptical about whether Kensuke's "date" was genuine.  
"是啊，可惜这只是一次性的事情，你以后再也见不到那个女孩了，伙计，" Toji 补充道，仍然怀疑 Kensuke 的“约会”是否真实。"

"Hey, that's not true either Toji, in fact, Shinobu even gave me her phone number," Kensuke declared which even shocked her two friends.  
"嘿，那也不对，冬二，实际上，四叶还把她的电话号码给了我呢，" 真希宣称，这让她的两个朋友都感到惊讶。

"A-huh and where is this phone number then?" Toji asked.  
"啊哈，那这个电话号码现在在哪儿呢？" 冬二问道。

"It's right here written on my hand and….oh, oh, oh no, no, no, no, it's gone!?" Kensuke freaked out as when he looked at his hand, the phone number which was written in pen ink unfortunately was smudged around his hand, making it unreadable.  
"就在这儿，写在我手上，而且……哦，哦，哦不，不，不，不，它不见了！？" 真希惊慌失措，当他看向自己的手时，那用钢笔墨水写下的电话号码不幸地被弄花了，变得无法辨认。

"This isn't fair! Curse my sweaty palms!" Kensuke cried out as he fell to his knees on the sand while Shinji and Toji gave their friend a look of pity.  
"这不公平！该死的手汗！" 真嗣和东治同情地看着朋友，只见他跪倒在沙滩上，哀嚎着。

"Hey! Are you three ready yet? We're good to go now. If we don't hurry, we'll hit more traffic on the way home!" Kaji waved to the three boys.  
"嘿！你们三个准备好了吗？我们现在可以出发了。如果不快点，回家路上会遇到更多交通堵塞的！" 加持向三个男孩挥手喊道。

"Oh…yeah we're coming, Kaji!" Shinji called back to the unshaven man, before looking down at the kneeling and depressed Kensuke for a second and back to Toji who nodded in silent agreement before both boys helped Kensuke up and dragged him back to the van.  
"哦…好的，我们来了，加持！" 真嗣回应着那位胡子拉碴的男人，然后低头看了一眼跪在地上沮丧的守，又转向东治，后者默默点头同意，两人便扶起守，拖着他回到车上。

End.

(OMAKE-ENDING)

The atmosphere in the command centre at Terminal Dogma was in panic due to what was occurring in Tokyo 3. Just when everyone thought that they never had to deal with situations like this again with the angels all gone, a giant creature coming out of the ocean was definitely unexpected.  
位于终端教条区的指挥中心内，气氛因东京 3 区正在发生的事件而陷入恐慌。就在所有人都以为随着使徒的消失，他们再也不用面对此类情况时，一只从海洋中出现的巨型生物无疑出乎意料。

On the NERV screen, everyone saw that the JSSDF was firing everything they had at the enemy but nothing was doing any sort of physical damage. At this rate everyone feared that they would have to resort to using N2 mines to destroy it, which would result in the destruction of the city.  
在 NERV 的屏幕上，众人看到日本自卫队正倾尽所有火力攻击敌人，但没有任何攻击能造成实质性伤害。照此下去，大家担心不得不动用 N2 地雷来摧毁它，这将导致整个城市的毁灭。

While everyone was looking on the situation in fear, one little girl who was being held tightly by her parents looked at the giant screen in confusion before changing into one of pure happiness and wonder.  
当众人惊恐地关注着局势时，一个小女孩被父母紧紧抱着，她先是困惑地看着巨型屏幕，随后转变成纯粹的喜悦和惊奇。

"Mama, Papa! It's Silly, he came back!" Aki cried out as she pointed at the screen, which everyone in the command centre stopped and looked back at the young girl in pure confusion.  
"妈妈，爸爸！是傻傻，他回来了！" 阿基指着屏幕喊道，指挥中心里的每个人都停下手中的工作，回头看向这个小女孩，满脸困惑。

"Wait, what did heck did she call that thing?" Aoba asked in confusion. A moment later everyone heard the load roar coming from the giant monster.  
"等等，她到底把那东西叫什么了？" 青叶困惑地问道。片刻后，所有人都听到了那只巨型怪物发出的震耳欲聋的咆哮声。

---

For all those going to say it, yes the tiny creature that Aki found was a very tiny first form Shin Godzilla.  
对于那些即将提出疑问的人，是的，阿基发现的那只小生物确实是非常微小的初代真·哥斯拉。

I kind of wanted to add it in for laughs, plus the Japanese Godzilla franchise is under Anno's shared Anno-verse along side his Evangelion, Ultraman and Kamen Rider. The last two I've never watched so don't start asking to do crossovers for them in this fic.  
我有点想加进去逗个乐，而且日本的哥斯拉系列与庵野秀明的其他作品——《新世纪福音战士》、《奥特曼》和《假面骑士》——共享同一个庵野宇宙。后两部我从未看过，所以别开始要求在这篇同人文中加入它们的交叉剧情。

Anyway hope you liked this chapter and please leave a review if you can.  
总之，希望你喜欢这篇chapter，如果可以的话请留下评论。

### Chapter 15 Pizza Time!  
Chapter 15 披萨时间！

It was a quiet evening for the Ikari family in the shared Katsuragi apartment. After doing some food shopping and arriving back they had just started putting away their stuff while Shinji started preparing to cook that evening's dinner.  
对于碇家来说，这是一个宁静的傍晚，他们共同居住在葛城公寓里。购物归来后，他们刚刚开始整理物品，而真嗣则开始准备当晚的晚餐。

As he put on his apron and heated the frying pan, he, Asuka and Aki heard the sound of the front door opening, signalling that their guardian had revived home from work.  
当他穿上围裙并加热煎锅时，他和明日香、阿基听到了前门打开的声音，这意味着他们的监护人下班回家了。

Before the two parents could vocally welcome home the purple-haired woman or even before Aki could run over to welcome her auntie, they heard Misato call out.  
在两位家长能口头欢迎那位紫发女子回家之前，甚至在阿基能跑过去迎接她的阿姨之前，他们就听到了美里呼喊的声音。

"Shinji! Turn off the cooker and put down the frying pan! We are having takeout tonight kids!" Misato hollered excitedly as she finally came into view from the entry hallway.  
"真嗣！关掉炉子，放下煎锅！今晚我们吃外卖，孩子们！" 美里兴奋地喊着，终于从玄关走了进来。

"Wait, you mean that.." Asuka tried to finish but was quickly cut off as Misato quickly dropped her work bag on the kitchen table.  
"等等，你是说……" 明日香试图说完，但很快被美里打断，她迅速将工作包扔在厨房桌上。

"Yep that's right Asuka, I got word and confirmation that our local take-out places are re-opened for business."  
"没错，明日香，我得到了消息和确认，我们当地的外卖店已经重新开业了。"

While Asuka looked as excited as Misato did, Shinji on the other hand was apprehensive of the idea, knowing full well of Misato's habit of ordering fast foods rather than at least trying to cook a decent meal. Though then again, considering the older woman's natural talent of turning even a basic meal into something that resembles toxic sludge was astounding in itself.  
尽管明日香看起来和美里一样兴奋，但真嗣对此想法却感到忧虑，他深知美里习惯于点快餐而非至少尝试做一顿像样的饭菜。不过话说回来，考虑到这位年长女性将一顿基本餐点变成类似有毒泥浆的自然天赋，本身就令人惊叹。

But in all, they had just been shopping and Shinji was going to make dinner, especially with ingredients that were on sale and had to be used today. "But Misato..," Shinji tried to voice out but was promptly cut off.  
但总的来说，他们刚刚购物完毕，真嗣打算做晚饭，特别是用那些打折且今天必须用掉的食材。“但是美里……”真嗣试图开口，却被立即打断了。

"I know what you're gonna say Shinji and any food you bought today can be used for tomorrow or another day but now it's TAKE-OUT TONIGHT!" Misato cheered loudly again, leaving no room for more discussion. Shinji sighed, heavily knowing when the purpled-haired woman got like this there was no persuading her.  
“我知道你想说什么，真嗣，今天买的任何食物都可以留到明天或另一天，但现在就是外卖之夜！”美里再次大声欢呼，没有留下任何讨论的余地。真嗣重重地叹了口气，知道当这位紫发女子如此时，是无法说服她的。

"Ok gang, what do all you fancy?" Misato said as she quickly went into one of the kitchen cupboards and pulled out a bunch of menus before displaying them like a hand of cards in her hands. "We can get Fried Chicken, Chinese food, Indian food, Pizza or.."  
"好了，伙计们，你们都想吃什么？" 美里一边说着，迅速走到厨房的一个橱柜前，拿出几本菜单，像洗牌一样在手中展开。"我们可以点炸鸡、中餐、印度菜、披萨或者……"

"What's pizza?" Aki's small voice called out.  
"披萨是什么？" 阿基的小声音问道。

Aki's innocent question made Misato stop altogether before the older woman turned and looked down at her "niece". "Wait you don't know what pizza is, kiddo?" Misato asked slightly in disbelief.  
阿基天真的问题让美里完全停了下来，她转过身，低头看着她的"侄女"。"等等，你不知道披萨是什么，小家伙？" 美里略带怀疑地问道。

Aki shook her head no. "What is it?"  
Aki 摇了摇头。“这是什么？”

Rather than quickly answer the question, Misato walked over to the small girl before snatching her up and holding her close in a comforting hug. "Oh my God, you poor thing. How on earth have you not had pizza!" Misato cried out dramatically as she rocked the girl in her arms gently before looking at both her former charges with a slight stare of disappointment. "Shinji, Asuka! How could you deprive this girl of pizza?"  
Misato 并没有迅速回答问题，而是走向小女孩，一把将她抱起，紧紧拥在怀里给予安慰。“哦，天哪，可怜的孩子。你怎么会还没吃过披萨！”Misato 夸张地喊道，轻轻摇晃着怀中的女孩，然后略带失望地看着她以前的两个孩子。“真嗣，明日香！你们怎么能剥夺这孩子吃披萨的权利呢？”

Both parents looked at the older woman in disbelief. Surely she hadn't forgotten what they had told her. The years they spent in a post-third impact world, right?!  
两位家长难以置信地看着年长的女性。她肯定没忘记他们告诉她的事吧。他们在第三次冲击后的世界里度过的那些年，对吧？！

"Err Misato, remember we were kinda preoccupied with…things," Shinji said, stressing the emphasis on "things" being them trying to survive day to day after the end of humanity.  
“呃，美里，记得我们当时正忙着……各种事，”真嗣说道，特别强调了“各种事”是指他们在人类末日后每天挣扎求生的状态。

"And it wasn't like there was a special magical button that would instantly give us food you know," Asuka said sarcastically to the woman, a bit peeved at Misato for forgetting the details of all the struggles and hard work growing their food and scavenging for supplies while insinuating that they were depriving their baby of any food.  
“而且也不是有什么神奇按钮一按就能变出食物，你知道的，”明日香讽刺地对美里说，对美里忘记他们种植食物和搜寻补给的所有艰辛感到有些恼火，同时暗示他们似乎在剥夺婴儿的食物。

"Well, didn't you at least try to make your kind of pizza!?" Misato inquired. Surly they must have tried to make some foods with the stuff they had found or had grown. Sadly, she saw both of the teen parents shake their heads negatively.  
“那么，你们至少尝试过做点披萨之类的吧！？”美里问道。她确信他们一定尝试过用找到或种出的东西做些食物。遗憾的是，她看到两位青少年父母都摇了摇头表示否定。

"We just didn't have the ingredients and we were limited to what we could grow," Shinji explained. They did try to be creative with what they could grow and scavenge occasionally for Aki's sake but there was only so much they could do at the time.  
"我们只是缺少食材，而且只能依靠自己种植的东西，" 真嗣解释道。他们确实尝试过用能种和偶尔搜寻到的食材为阿基创造些新花样，但当时能做到的也就那么多了。

"Hey! What is pizza!?" Aki called out as she looked at everyone, a bit tired of being ignored and that no one was answering her question.  
"嘿！披萨是什么！？" 阿基喊道，她看着大家，有点厌倦被忽视，而且没人回答她的问题。

"Well little troublemaker, let me weave the tale and origin of one of the greatest things ever created by mankind alongside TV, air conditioners, instant noodles, indoor plumbing and of course Bee…" Misato trailed off as she saw Asuka instantly giving her a warning glare, knowing full well that she was going to say beer.  
"好吧，小捣蛋鬼，让我来讲述一下披萨的故事和起源，这是人类创造的最伟大的事物之一，与电视、空调、方便面、室内管道系统，当然还有啤……" 美里话音未落，就看到明日香立刻向她投来警告的目光，她完全知道美里接下来要说的是啤酒。

"And bee what?" Aki asked.  
"变成什么？" 阿基问道。

"Bee…hive, yeah beehives. You know, for making honey," Misato quickly said. However, she saw that Aki was now glaring at her and pouting at her choice.  
"变成……蜂巢，对，蜂巢。你知道的，为了制作蜂蜜，" 美里迅速说道。然而，她看到阿基现在正瞪着她，对她选择的事物撅起了嘴。

"I don't like bees. One stung me on my hand when I was just being nice and I'll never forgive them!" Aki proclaimed loudly and pridefully. Even raising her small fist in the arm to show her defiance.  
"我不喜欢蜜蜂。有一次我好心对待它们，结果手上被蜇了一下，我永远不会原谅它们！" 阿基大声而自豪地宣称，甚至举起她的小拳头以示反抗。

"Well…ok no to beehive then. Anyway, we're getting off track here. Pizza was created back in a country called Italy.."  
"嗯…好吧，不要蜂窝了。话说回来，我们扯远了。披萨是在一个叫意大利的国家发明的…"

"Where is that? Is it near here?" Aki quickly cut in due to not knowing what Italy even was or how far it was.  
"那在哪儿？离这儿近吗？" 阿基迅速插话，因为他连意大利是什么、有多远都不知道。

"Oh err ok scratch that part. Well, pizza was made a long time ago about a couple of hundreds of years.."  
"哦，呃，好吧，这部分跳过。总之，披萨是很久以前，大约几百年前发明的…"

"Hundreed? I don't think I can count that many…oh but can go up to seventeen!" Aki said, being proud of her current ability to count to that particular number.  
"一百？我觉得我数不到那么多…哦，但我可以数到十七！" 亚纪说道，对自己能数到这个特定的数字感到自豪。

"Oh err…well that's good for you. Anyway, pizza is made up of flattened bread that is usually topped with tomato sauce and cheese.."  
"哦，呃…好吧，那对你来说挺好的。话说回来，披萨是由压平的面包制成的，通常上面会涂上番茄酱和奶酪.."

"Cheezz?…Oooh, I know that! Mama and Papa tried to make it before, but it always came out weird and funny." Aki giggled remembering the time her parents tried making it.  
"奶酪？…哦，我知道那个！妈妈和爸爸以前试做过，但总是变得奇怪又滑稽。" 亚纪咯咯笑着，回忆起父母尝试做奶酪的那次。

Asuka and Shinji shared a smile while also remembering their attempts at making certain products like butter and cheese during those times but unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in producing anything good or even last. Once again it was more due to the limitations of their applications and resources that had at their disposal at the time but they had some funny moments experimenting back then.  
明日香和真嗣相视一笑，同时回忆起那些日子里尝试制作黄油和奶酪的经历，可惜他们未能成功做出任何像样的东西，甚至连勉强维持都不行。这再次归咎于当时他们所拥有的应用和资源的局限性，但那时的实验确实给他们带来了不少有趣的瞬间。

"Well, this type of cheese the pizza places have, honey, is way better than what you guys were trying to make. It's rich and creamy that it melts in your mouth and with any kind of topping you want on it, it's the perfect food for any occasion," Misato went on as she walked over to the kitchen table, grabbing the pizza menu before handing it to Aki to see.  
“嗯，这种披萨店里的奶酪，亲爱的，比你们当时尝试做的要好得多。它浓郁而细腻，入口即化，无论你想在上面放什么配料，它都是任何场合的完美食物，”美里继续说道，她走到餐桌旁，拿起披萨菜单递给阿基看。

"See this, this is what pizza looks like and you love eating meat right?" Misato questioned although she already knew Aki's love of anything with meat by now. "Look, they got the perfect pizza for you. A meat lovers pizza!"  
“看这个，这就是披萨的样子，而且你不是喜欢吃肉吗？”美里问道，尽管她已经知道阿基对任何带肉的食物的热爱。“看，他们有为你量身定做的披萨。肉食者披萨！”

"A meat-lover pizza," Aki repeated, her voice filled with utmost wonder as she stared at the picture of the said pizza item on the menu.  
"一份肉食爱好者披萨，" 亚纪重复道，她的声音充满了极大的惊奇，目光紧盯着菜单上那张披萨图片。

"Yep, it's got all the toppings of pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham, bacon, pork and beef…and she's drooling," Misato said as she finally noticed Aki was no longer listening and was majorly drooling on the menu and table.  
"没错，上面有意大利辣香肠、意大利香肠、火腿、培根、猪肉和牛肉的所有配料……而她已经流口水了，" 美里说道，终于注意到亚纪不再听她说话，而是对着菜单和桌子大流口水。

"I want meat lovers," Aki voiced out like she was in a trance before taking a deep breath. "I WANT MEAT LOVERS!" Aki shouted excitedly. "I want meat, I want meat, I want meat!"  
"我要肉食爱好者披萨，" 亚纪像是在恍惚中说出这句话，然后深吸一口气。"我要肉食爱好者披萨！" 亚纪兴奋地大喊。"我要肉，我要肉，我要肉！"

"Ok, ok, we'll get you your own personal meat lovers, kiddo," Misato declared, smiling at seeing how excited the little girl was.  
“好了，好了，我们会给你弄个专属的肉食爱好者披萨，小家伙，”美里宣布道，看到小女孩如此兴奋，她笑了。

"YAAY!" Aki cheered.

"Wait, Misato, you're getting Aki a whole pizza?" Shinji said a bit concerned. He knew from experience that this pizza takeout was infamous for its sizes.  
“等等，美里，你要给阿基买一整个披萨？”真嗣有些担忧地说。他从经验中知道这家披萨外卖以其尺寸而臭名昭著。

"Oh relax, I'm not getting her a humongous eighteen-inch for crying out loud. I'll get her a twelve-inch one to start with," Misato said although Shinji still gave her a look of disapproval, believing a simple ten-inch would have been preferable for Aki.  
“哦，放松点，我又不是要给她买个十八英寸的巨无霸，哭笑不得。我会先给她买个十二英寸的，”美里说，尽管真嗣仍然给了她一个不赞成的眼神，认为给阿基买个十英寸的会更合适。

"Ok so besides Aki, what do you guys want? Are you sharing a pizza or do you want separate ones?" Misato asked the two parents as she started writing down on a piece of paper.  
“好吧，除了阿基，你们还想吃什么？是要共享一个披萨还是各自点不同的？”美里一边问着两位家长，一边开始在纸上记录。

"It's fine, me and Shinji will just share a triple pepperoni," Asuka replied giving Shinji a look who nodded in agreement, although reluctantly, still wishing to have cooked a nice dinner instead.  
“没关系，我和真嗣就共享一个三重意大利辣香肠的，”明日香回答道，同时瞥了真嗣一眼，后者虽然不情愿但还是点头同意了，心里仍希望自己能做一顿美味的晚餐。

"Ok, so a fourteen-inch triple pepperoni and oh I nearly forgot!" Misato said as she went over to the other fridge in the house, knocking on the small door at the bottom a few times. "PenPen, we're getting pizza! You want your usual seafood pizza, little guy?" Misato called out and not a few seconds later the door opened with PenPen poking his head out, looking up at the purple-haired woman.  
“好的，那就点一个十四英寸的三重意大利辣香肠，哦，差点忘了！”美里说着走向家里的另一个冰箱，敲了敲底部的小门几次。“PenPen，我们订披萨了！你想要你平常的海鲜披萨吗，小家伙？”美里喊道，没过几秒钟，门就开了，PenPen 探出头来，抬头看着紫发的女子。

"WARK!" PenPen cried in confirmation, with an additional wave of his clawed hand.  
"哇克！" 企鹅 PenPen 确认道，同时挥了挥他那带爪的手。

"Ok, then that just leaves my order and I'm getting my classic, Hawaiian pizza," Misato declared, writing down her choice before walking over to the house phone.  
"好吧，那就只剩我的订单了，我要经典的夏威夷披萨，" 美里宣布道，记下她的选择后走向家用电话。

Her choice did not sit well with a certain redhead who gave the older woman a gross-out expression. "Ughh seriously why that pizza Misato?"  
她的选择让某位红发少女颇为不满，她对这位年长的女性露出了厌恶的表情。"呃，真的吗，为什么选那个披萨，美里？"

"Hey, what's wrong with Hawaiian?"  
"嘿，夏威夷披萨有什么问题吗？"

"It's just…I don't know it's just unnatural to put fruit on a pizza," Asuka tried explaining.  
"只是……我不知道，在披萨上放水果总觉得不太自然，" 明日香尝试解释道。"

"Well, tomatoes are a fruit and they're used as the sauce on a pizza, plus the sweetness of the pineapple adds well to the saltiness of the pizza overall," Misato countered.  
"嗯，番茄也是水果，而且它们被用作披萨的酱料，再加上菠萝的甜味与披萨整体的咸味相得益彰，" 美里反驳道。"

Asuka tried to say something but ended up just giving up and leaving the whole debate. "Ah fine, whatever. Order your freaky pizza."  
明日香试图说些什么，但最终只是放弃了整个争论。“啊，好吧，随你便。点你的怪异披萨吧。”

"Hey, it's not freaky! Besides, I bet you that Aki-chan will love it too," Misato challenged the redhead mother, while she started typing in the pizza place number on the phone.  
“嘿，这并不怪异！再说了，我打赌秋也会喜欢它的，”美里向红发的母亲挑战道，同时开始在电话上输入披萨店的号码。

"She doesn't know what pineapple even is, right Schätzchen?" Asuka said as she turned to her daughter, who was still staring at the pizza menu while fidgeting where she stood.  
“她甚至不知道菠萝是什么，对吧，宝贝？”明日香说着转向她的女儿，女儿仍在盯着披萨菜单，站在那里不安地扭动着。

"Meat.." That was all Aki said and once again wiped the drool with her top sleeve.  
“肉……” 阿基只说了这么一句，然后再次用上衣袖子擦掉了口水。

"Oh yes hello, I like to order a bunch of pizzas, please," Misato hollered to the pizza place on the line. In less than a few minutes, she was able to list down everyone's orders over the phone, even including some side snacks like garlic bread and some wings to the mix.  
“哦，是的，你好，我想订一堆披萨，请，”美里对着电话那头的披萨店喊道。不到几分钟，她就能在电话里列出每个人的订单，甚至还包括了一些小吃，比如蒜蓉面包和一些鸡翅。

As Misato put the phone down, she felt a tap on her leg and looked down at the eyes of an impatient Aki. "Auntie, when's my meaty pizza coming?"  
美里放下电话，感觉到腿上被轻轻一拍，低头看到了阿基不耐烦的眼神。“阿姨，我的肉披萨什么时候来？”

"Well kiddo, it should be about thirty minutes, so don't worry it will be here in no time," Misato reassured the young child.  
"好了孩子，大概需要三十分钟，别担心，很快就会到了，" 美里安慰着年幼的孩子。

Unfortunately, patience wasn't Aki's strong suit. "Ehhh?! That long!? But I want it NOW!"  
不幸的是，耐心并不是明美的强项。"哎？！那么久？！可我现在就想要！"

x-x-x-x

"Guys, I need help here, please! Got the pizza but your little gremlin won't let go of my leg," Misato shouted as she slowly limped back from the apartment's entryway while carefully holding in both arms a stack of pizza boxes with Aki latching on to her right leg like a clingy koala bear. "She even tried to tackle the pizza guy before I stopped her."  
"伙计们，我需要帮忙！披萨拿到了，但你们的小捣蛋鬼就是不放开我的腿，" 美里一边慢慢跛行着从公寓入口回来，一边小心翼翼地用双臂抱着一堆披萨盒，而明美像只黏人的考拉熊一样紧紧抱住她的右腿。"她甚至试图在阻止她之前扑向送披萨的人。"

"Meaty, meaty!" Aki repeated, obviously so hungry for her food that her speech devolved into saying a single word.  
“肉肉的，肉肉的！”阿基重复着，显然她对食物的渴望已经到了让她的语言退化成单一词汇的地步。

Asuka came over to help grab the boxes in Misato's arms while Shinji was able to untangle and grab his hungry feral daughter before placing her on the chair at the kitchen table.  
明日香过来帮忙从美里怀里接过盒子，而真嗣则设法解开并抓住了他那饥饿如野兽般的女儿，然后将她放在厨房餐桌旁的椅子上。

"Oh man, I have been waiting for this. Shame I couldn't have used my old tricks to get a discount from the pizza guy," Misato said as she gave her "niece" a slightly irritated look. She had it all planned out after answering the door but Aki in her hunger ruined any chance of that.  
“哦，天哪，我一直在等这个。真可惜我没能用我以前的伎俩从披萨小哥那里打个折，”美里说着，给了她的“侄女”一个略带恼怒的眼神。她原本在开门后一切都计划好了，但阿基的饥饿破坏了任何机会。

"And what tricks would those be Misato?" Asuka asked, giving the woman a disapproving look, already assuming what tricks those were.  
"Misato，那些把戏是什么？" 明日香问道，给了女人一个不赞成的眼神，已经猜到了那些把戏是什么。

"Nothing like what you're probably thinking Asuka. I just flirt with them and nothing more," Misato said. It was true she did flirt heavily with the delivery guys to get discounts for her food especially if they were either cute or handsome fellows, although she did leave out that many times she would purposely dress in revealing clothes to up the ante. A few times in the past she did come to the door in nothing but a bath towel and even gave one poor guy a nosebleed.  
"不像你想象的那样，明日香。我只是和他们调调情，仅此而已，" 美里说。确实，她确实会和送货员调情以获得食物折扣，尤其是如果他们是可爱或英俊的家伙，尽管她没有提到很多时候她会故意穿暴露的衣服来增加赌注。过去有几次，她只裹着一条浴巾来开门，甚至让一个可怜的家伙流了鼻血。

"Ok gang, time to dig in, here's your guys's pepperoni, PenPen's seafood, my Hawaiian, the garlic bread and chicken wings and last of all, for the little munchkin, her little meat lovers," Misato laid out and opened the boxes containing their foods and showing Aki hers by opening the box in front of her.  
"好了，伙计们，开动吧，这是你们的意大利辣香肠披萨，PenPen 的海鲜披萨，我的夏威夷披萨，蒜蓉面包和鸡翅，最后，给小家伙，她的迷你肉食者披萨，" 美里一边说一边打开装有他们食物的盒子，并打开盒子给 Aki 看她的那份。

While everyone dug into their food, they noticed that Aki, who was before obsessed with eating this so-called pizza was simply looking over it with uncertainty.  
当大家开始享用食物时，他们注意到之前对这种所谓的披萨痴迷不已的 Aki，现在却只是带着不确定的神情审视着它。

"Hey, what's wrong Schätzchen?" Asuka asked her daughter.  
“嘿，怎么了，小宝贝？”明日香问她的女儿。

"Is something wrong with the pizza?" Shinji asked concerned.  
“披萨有什么问题吗？”真嗣关切地问道。

"Um, is the food supposed to be like this, Mama, Papa?" Aki questioned. It seemed that upon seeing her pizza she now felt unsure to even eat something that looked strange, yellow and a mixture of different toppings.  
“呃，妈妈，爸爸，这食物应该是这样的吗？”阿基问道。看到她的披萨后，她现在感到不确定，甚至不敢吃这种看起来奇怪、黄色且混合了各种配料的东西。

"Hey, of course it's supposed to look like this kiddo. That's what makes it so good," Misato quickly added. "Just have one bite I promise you'll love it. Like the old saying don't knock it till you tried it once."  
“嘿，当然应该是这样的，孩子。这就是它如此美味的原因，”美里迅速补充道，“就咬一口，我保证你会喜欢的。就像那句老话说的，不试一次别急着否定。”

Aki, still unsure, looked to her parents for support and saw them give her a smile and nod. Aki took hold of a slice, giving it a look over before finally taking a bite out of it.  
阿基仍然不确定，向父母寻求支持，看到他们向她微笑并点头。阿基拿起一片，仔细看了看，最后咬了一口。

"So what do you think, Aki?" Misato asked as she took another slice of her pizza while she, Asuka and Shinji looked on at the girl, hoping for a positive response rather than a negative one.  
“你觉得怎么样，Aki？”美里一边问，一边又切下一块披萨，她和明日香、真嗣都注视着女孩，希望她的反应是积极的而非消极的。

Aki however didn't seem to move, apparently looked frozen in place, as if her little brain and taste buds were trying to process what was put in her mouth. Just when everyone was about to voice their concerns, the girl's eyes seemed to sparkle before she quickly chewed the pizza in her mouth and ultimately devoured the rest of the slice before reaching for the next one in the box. The speed at which she was eating was starting to worry both Asuka and Shinji while Misato sighed in relief, happy that the kid was enjoying the food.  
然而，Aki 似乎一动不动，显然像是僵在了原地，仿佛她的小脑袋和味蕾正在努力处理嘴里放进去的东西。就在大家即将表达担忧时，女孩的眼睛似乎闪烁了一下，然后她迅速咀嚼着嘴里的披萨，最终吞下了剩下的那片，并伸手去拿盒子里下一片。她吃东西的速度开始让明日香和真嗣感到担忧，而美里则松了一口气，高兴地看到孩子享受着食物。

"Aki, honey, please slow down," Shinji tried to tell his daughter, worried that she might overstuff her mouth and choke at the speed she was eating but Aki was not listening. Already she finished her second slice of pizza and was going for her third at a rapid pace.  
“Aki，亲爱的，请慢点吃，”真嗣试图告诉他的女儿，担心她会因为吃得太快而噎到，但 Aki 没有听进去。她已经迅速吃完了第二片披萨，正以极快的速度去拿第三片。

"More! More!" Aki shouted as she finally gave a break from stuffing her face. She looked very happy even as pieces of cheese and meat toppings stuck around her mouth.  
“再来！再来！”阿基喊道，终于从狼吞虎咽中稍作休息。她看起来非常开心，尽管嘴边还粘着奶酪和肉片。

x-x-x-x-x

"Well, I hope you are proud of yourself Misato," Asuka voiced to the older woman as she helped cleaning the mess around the table along with Shinji who was stacking up the now empty pizza boxes.  
“嗯，希望你对自己感到骄傲，美里，”明日香对年长的女人说道，同时和真嗣一起帮忙清理桌子周围的狼藉，真嗣正在叠起已经空了的披萨盒。

"Well, yeah, of course. I think this was a very good first takeaway experience for Aki," Misato said, happy with how everything turned out.  
“嗯，当然，当然。我觉得这对阿基来说是一次非常棒的外卖初体验，”美里说道，对事情的结果感到满意。

"You turned my little sunshine into a gluttonous pizza freak," Asuka exclaimed. Looking over Asuka saw her Schätzchen now sleeping happily on one of the bean bags in the living room with a now full bloated belly.  
"你把我的小太阳变成了一个贪吃的披萨怪," 明日香惊呼道。她环顾四周，看到她的宝贝现在正幸福地在客厅的一个懒人沙发上熟睡，肚子吃得圆滚滚的。

It wasn't an exaggeration as after Aki had finished her meat lover's pizza all on her own, she had also gone after everyone else's, taking a few slices from each set and easily devouring the sides they had ordered.  
这并非夸张，因为阿基独自吃完了一份肉食爱好者披萨后，还盯上了其他人的，从每份披萨中拿了几片，轻松地吃掉了他们点的配菜。

"I'm surprised that she even ate a few slices of PenPen's seafood pizza. I mean she always made a fuss when we cooked fish before?" Shinji wondered as he finished putting away the empty boxes in a garbage bag.  
"我真惊讶她居然吃了几片 PenPen 的海鲜披萨。我是说，她以前总是对我们做的鱼大惊小怪的？" 真嗣一边说着，一边把空盒子收进垃圾袋。

It was true, Aki had always hated eating defenceless fishy, especially when it looked like it was fish to the girl, which made it difficult for Asuka and Shinji to get her to eat it. They compromised by sometimes mixing it in with other foods or cutting it up into pieces that made it easier for the girl to eat it.  
确实如此，Aki 一直讨厌吃那些毫无防备的鱼类，尤其是当它看起来像是要被女孩吃掉的鱼时，这让 Asuka 和 Shinji 很难让她吃下。他们妥协了，有时将鱼混入其他食物中，或者切成小块，这样女孩吃起来就容易多了。

So it came to the parent's surprise as when all the other pizzas were gone Aki had set her sights on trying the seafood pizza, seemly unbothered when told by everyone that it had fish in it. Despite PenPen putting up a valiant effort even his seafood pizza wasn't spared as Aki had managed to take a couple of slices from the bird despite him constantly guarding it away from the little girl.  
所以当所有其他披萨都被吃光时，Aki 却把目光投向了海鲜披萨，似乎并不介意大家告诉她里面有鱼。尽管 PenPen 竭尽全力保护自己的海鲜披萨，但 Aki 还是设法从小鸟那里抢走了几片，尽管他一直在努力不让小女孩靠近。

At the end of the night, there was no leftover pizza.  
到了晚上结束时，一块披萨也没有剩下。

"Hehe, yummy pizza," Aki mumbled happily in her sleep.  
"呵呵，美味的披萨，" 亚纪在睡梦中幸福地喃喃自语。

### Chapter 16 Strike a Pose  
Chapter 16 摆个姿势

It was an early Saturday morning in the shared Katsuragi apartment. Still so early that nearly all the occupants were still sound asleep except one individual who broke the quiet morning of the apartment with several sounds of retches, often arrhythmic and violent, interrupted only briefly by muffled groans and barely audible murmurs coming from the open bathroom.  
那是周六的一个清晨，在共用的葛城公寓里。时间尚早，几乎所有住户都还在沉睡，除了一个打破清晨宁静的人，从敞开的浴室里不时传来几声呕吐声，时而无规律，时而剧烈，间或夹杂着低沉的呻吟和几乎听不见的低语。

'Oh God, why does this feel worse than throwing up after drinking,' Misato thought as she felt possibly another urge to throw up again but thankfully the feeling started to recede allowing the older woman a moment to rest, although a bit undignified as she rested her head on the rim of the toilet.  
'哦天哪，为什么这感觉比喝醉后呕吐还难受，'美里心想，她感到可能又要呕吐了，但幸运的是这种感觉开始消退，让这位年长的女士有片刻的休息，尽管姿势有些不雅，她把头靠在马桶边缘。

Misato didn't know how long she just sat and laid her head in the bathroom, but it must have been a while and as she continued to stay put, her mind began to think of the reality of her situation.  
美里不知道自己在浴室里坐了多久，头一直靠在那里，但肯定有一段时间了。随着她继续待在原地，她的思绪开始思考自己所处现实的状况。

'God, what was I thinking of keeping the baby? I'm not fit to be a mother. I can barely look after myself let alone another human being,' Misato thought depressingly.  
“天啊，我当时怎么想的要留下这个孩子？我不配做母亲。我连自己都照顾不好，更别说另一个人了。”美里沮丧地想着。

She wished that Kaji was here, but the jerk once again had to go and sort out the mess that was happening with the Japanese government and the UN. A mess which he caused to begin with when he uploaded that computer worm to every news outlet in the world, exposing every secret SEELE had, including their involvement in starting the Second Impact and their attempt to start the Third Impact for the human instrumentality project.  
她希望加持在这里，但那个混蛋又一次不得不去处理日本政府和联合国之间的烂摊子。这个烂摊子正是他一开始造成的，当他将那个计算机蠕虫上传到全球每一家新闻机构，揭露了 SEELE 的所有秘密，包括他们启动第二次冲击和试图为人类补完计划启动第三次冲击的企图。

It was an understatement to say that every government around the world were scrambling to sort out the mess. The news channels were constantly covering the revelations uncovered and it didn't look like it was going to die down anytime soon as much of the stuff that they were showing to the public barely scratched the surface of the secrets, lies, corruption and violations of human rights SEELE did over the years.  
说全球各国政府都在争相收拾这个烂摊子都算是轻描淡写。新闻频道不断报道这些揭露出来的真相，而且看起来这股热潮短期内不会平息，因为他们向公众展示的内容只是 SEELE 多年来秘密、谎言、腐败和侵犯人权的冰山一角。

Even NERV was greatly affected as they were backed up financially by the said secret organisation for years. Their only saving grace was SEELE's attack on HQ made them look like victims in the eyes of many. Not to say that others disagreed as many also saw NERV as the ones trying to start Third Impact on their own, which wasn't that far from the truth as Gendo Ikari did try to cause an impact for his own for his selfish reasons.  
即使 NERV 也受到了严重影响，多年来他们一直由那个秘密组织提供财务支持。他们唯一的救赎是 SEELE 对总部的攻击使他们在许多人眼中看起来像是受害者。并不是说其他人不同意，因为许多人也认为 NERV 试图自行引发第三次冲击，这与事实相差不远，因为碇源堂确实为了自己的私利试图引发冲击。

She chuckled a bit. Possibly the only good thing about being pregnant right now was that she would be going on maternity leave for a year and that she wouldn't have to deal with the rest of the fallout and huge pile of paperwork till then.  
她轻声笑了一下。可能怀孕唯一的好处就是她将有一年的产假，这样她就不用在这之前处理剩下的烂摊子和堆积如山的文件了。

However, her chuckle was short-lived as she frowned deeply, her mind wandering again to more depressing thoughts. She wasn't exactly mother material and didn't know the first thing about how to be a parent. Looking after and being guardians to Shinji and Asuka was different as they were teenagers and even then, she knew that she had screwed up in the other timeline. Granted the kids never directly said it but from the information she was able to get out of them she knew for certain that she had completely failed them both and they had paid the price for that failure.  
然而，她的轻笑转瞬即逝，眉头深锁，思绪再次飘向那些令人沮丧的想法。她并非天生的母亲，对如何为人父母一无所知。照顾和守护真嗣与明日香与照顾青少年不同，即便如此，她也知道在另一个时间线中自己搞砸了。尽管孩子们从未直接提及，但从她从他们那里得到的信息来看，她确信自己彻底辜负了他们，而他们为此付出了代价。

Maybe it wasn't too late to change her mind.  
或许现在改变主意还不算太晚。

"Auntie?"

Startled at the sound of the small voice, Misato lifted her head and turned back to see in the doorway to the restroom was Aki who was wearing her pink reddish nightgown while in her hand she held her doll. A look of concern was on her young face.  
听到那细小的声音，美里吃了一惊，抬起头来，转身看到洗手间的门口站着阿基，她穿着粉红色的睡裙，手里抱着她的玩偶。她稚嫩的脸上带着关切的神情。

Putting on a brave face as well as a smile for the little girl, Misato turned herself around but still laid down sitting with her back to the toilet.  
米萨托强作镇定，对小女孩露出微笑，转身背对着马桶坐下。

"Hey munchkin," Misato greeted her "niece" as best as she could despite still feeling a bit queasy. "What are you doing up so early?" the purple-haired woman asked.  
“嘿，小家伙，”米萨托尽量亲切地向她的“侄女”打招呼，尽管她仍感到有些不适。“你怎么这么早就醒了？”紫发女子问道。

It wasn't that surprising to her as from what Asuka and Shinji had told her and seeing it firsthand herself for the past few months or so, Aki's sleeping patterns varied from either getting up at the crack of dawn to sleeping until nearly late morning.  
对此她并不感到惊讶，因为过去几个月里，从明日香和真嗣告诉她的情况以及她亲眼所见，亚纪的睡眠模式确实多变，有时天刚亮就起床，有时则睡到快中午才醒。

"My TV show is on soon and I want to watch it," Aki proclaimed happily and excitedly.  
“我的电视节目马上就要开始了，我想看，”Aki 高兴而兴奋地宣布。

Misato chuckled at that. Ever since Aki learned about TV programming, she all but overtook reign over the TV, even "battling" PenPen over what to watch which became even more funny when Aki had found the second TV remote. It reminded her of when Asuka and Shinji did their synchronised training and when they fought over what they wanted to watch.  
听到这话，美里轻声笑了起来。自从 Aki 了解了电视节目后，她几乎完全掌控了电视，甚至会和 PenPen 争夺看什么节目，当 Aki 找到第二个电视遥控器时，这场争夺变得更加有趣了。这让她想起了明日香和真嗣进行同步训练的时候，以及他们为了想看的节目而争吵的情景。

"Auntie, are you ok? Are you sick? I can go and get Papa," Aki asked out of concern.  
“阿姨，你还好吗？你生病了吗？我可以去叫爸爸，”Aki 关切地问道。

"Oh no no, it's fine Aki, I'm ok, it's just…err…something bad I ate yesterday that's coming back to haunt me," Misato told the little girl, trying to give the best excuse.  
“哦不不，没事的阿基，我没事，只是……呃……昨天吃了些不好的东西，现在有点反应，”美里对小女孩说，试图找个最好的借口。

"Really?" Aki still looked a bit unconvinced, making Misato ponder whether Aki had heard her throwing up or how long she had been watching her without the former major even knowing.  
“真的吗？”阿基看起来还是有点不相信，这让美里思考阿基是不是听到了她呕吐的声音，或者她已经偷偷观察了她多久，而前少校却浑然不觉。

"Yeah, really kiddo," Misato reassured the girl while trying her best to smile in hopes of calming the brown-haired girl, as she slowly got up off the floor. Already she felt better and no longer felt nauseous; her stomach now rather demanded something to eat.  
“真的，小家伙，”美里安慰着女孩，同时尽力微笑，希望能安抚这个棕发女孩，她慢慢地从地板上站起来。她已经感觉好多了，不再感到恶心；她的胃现在反而需要吃点东西。

"Oh…ok! Race you to the TV!" Aki challenged before quickly dashing away to the living room.  
“哦…好！电视前赛跑！”阿基挑战道，随即迅速冲向客厅。

Misato laughed a bit, knowing full well that she couldn't beat the little one even if she tried and at her best. So, walking to the kitchen she now pondered on what to make herself as she couldn't have her traditional morning beer anymore due to obviously being pregnant and unfortunately coffee was also not an option either, since she was advised that she should avoid that as well.  
美里轻笑一声，深知即使全力以赴也赢不了这个小家伙。于是，她走向厨房，思索着该给自己做些什么，毕竟由于怀孕，她不能再喝传统的早间啤酒，而且不幸的是，咖啡也不再是选项，因为她被告知也应避免饮用。

Looking into the fridge, Misato frowned as she saw there was an abundance of soft drinks that now replaced her once large stock of Yebisu beer. Another reminder that this was going to become a norm in her life once the baby was born.  
美里打开冰箱，皱起眉头，发现里面塞满了软饮，取代了她曾经大量囤积的惠比寿啤酒。这再次提醒她，一旦宝宝出生，这种生活将成为常态。

Sighing and seeing no other choice, Misato took one of the soft drinks and opened one before putting it to her lips to drink. Surprisingly she found that the taste wasn't that bad and maybe something she could get used to.  
叹了口气，别无选择之下，美里拿起一罐软饮料，打开后送到嘴边喝了起来。意外地，她发现味道并不差，或许她能逐渐习惯这种饮料。

Her stomach grumbled and she needed something to eat now. Seeing a bag full of bread, Misato settled for good old simple toast as a start. Looking to the living room, the purple-haired woman saw Aki already having settled down in front of the TV and started rapidly channel surfing using the TV remote.  
她的肚子咕咕叫了起来，急需吃点东西。看到一袋满满的面包，美里决定先来几片简单却美味的吐司。她望向客厅，只见紫发的女子亚纪已经安顿在电视机前，正迅速地用遥控器切换频道。

"Hey Aki, I'm making toast for breakfast, you want some?"  
“嘿，亚纪，我在做吐司当早餐，你要来点吗？”

"Yes please!" Aki shouted back even as she continued to channel surf in concentration to find her TV show, making Misato wonder how the little girl could tell or even find her show when all the older woman could see was rapidly blurred images changing across the screen. "Can I have butter and strawberry jam on it, please?"  
"好的，请来一份！" 亚纪大声回应着，同时专注地切换电视频道，试图找到她想看的节目，这让美里不禁好奇这个小女孩是如何辨别并找到节目的，因为屏幕上快速闪过的模糊图像对美里来说根本无法辨认。"可以给我加黄油和草莓酱吗？"

"Yeah, sure thing kiddo," Misato complied, putting the bread in the toaster and just waiting for it to get done while going back to drinking the soft juice. A minute later the toast was ready and she made Aki's toast first, spreading the butter and jam before doing her own. Knowing that Aki wasn't going to move from her spot in front of the TV, the older woman went over with the plate of toast to Aki who looked to have finally stopped switching through the channels and seemly found the network she was looking for.  
"当然可以，小家伙，" 美里答应道，将面包放入烤面包机中，等待它烤好的同时继续喝着果汁。一分钟后，吐司烤好了，她先给亚纪做了一份，涂上黄油和草莓酱，然后才做自己的。知道亚纪不会离开电视前的位置，这位年长的女性便端着装有吐司的盘子走向亚纪，只见她似乎终于停止了切换频道，似乎找到了她想要的电视台。

"Here you go Aki, butter and extra strawberry jam, just as you like it,"  
"给你，亚纪，黄油和额外的草莓酱，就像你喜欢的样子，"

"Danke schön, auntie!" Aki thanked Misato in a mixture of German and Japanese as she briefly turned to face the older woman as she placed her plate down.  
“谢谢您，阿姨！”Aki 用德语和日语混合着向美里道谢，她转身面对着年长的女性，同时放下手中的盘子。

"Oh…err…bitte?" Misato said after momentarily trying to remember her German. The one German phrase she remembered by heart was how to order a drink over the bar.  
“哦…呃…不客气？”美里在短暂地试图回忆她的德语后说道。她唯一记得的德语短语是如何在酒吧点饮料。

Her brief pause and confusion however were met with a little snicker from the four-year-old, making Misato frown. It wasn't her fault that she was very rusty with her German as it's been years since she had to use it.  
然而，她短暂的停顿和困惑却引来了四岁孩子的轻笑，这让美里皱起了眉头。她德语生疏并不是她的错，毕竟已经多年没有使用过了。

In all honesty, it was pretty amazing for her to see Aki being able to speak fluently in both German and Japanese language. When she commented to Asuka and Shinji about it, they were just as surprised that their little girl was learning two languages so quickly despite them not teaching her properly.  
老实说，看到 Aki 能够流利地说德语和日语，真是令人惊叹。当她向明日香和真嗣提及此事时，他们同样惊讶于自己的小女儿能在没有得到适当教导的情况下如此迅速地学会两种语言。

"Yes! I found the channel!" Aki shouted making Misato jump slightly unexpectedly at the announcement.  
“耶！我找到那个频道了！”Aki 大喊道，这让 Misato 意外地稍微跳了一下。

Turning to the TV Misato saw what seemed to be a cartoon channel but looked like it was finishing as she saw the ending credits.  
Misato 转向电视，看到似乎是一个卡通频道，但看起来快要结束了，因为她看到了片尾字幕。

Curious about what Aki was planning to watch she asked. "Hey Aki, what's this show you're interested in? Is it the one where you dance along with the mascot?" Misato asked with a teasing smirk on her face. Admittedly she and everyone else got a laugh at watching the girl get up and sing and dance to the program.  
"好奇 Aki 打算看什么节目，她问道：“嘿 Aki，你对这个节目感兴趣吗？是不是那个你会跟着吉祥物一起跳舞的那个？”美里脸上带着调侃的笑容问道。不可否认，她和大家都觉得看着女孩站起来唱歌跳舞的节目很有趣。”

"Nooo, it's not! I got bored at that one, plus it was for babies anyway," Aki whined and frowned but all it did was make her cute.  
"“不不不，不是那个！那个我早就看腻了，而且本来就是给小宝宝看的，”Aki 抱怨着皱起眉头，但这只是让她显得更可爱。”

"Ooh really? Aren't you still a baby?" Misato teased.  
"“哦，真的吗？你难道不是还在婴儿期吗？”美里继续调侃道。”

"Noo! I'm not a baby! I'm a big girl," Aki argued back, turning her head away from her aunt with a pout.  
“不！我不是婴儿！我是大孩子，”阿基反驳道，把头转向一边，撅起了嘴。

'Wow…she really is like her mother,' Misato thought as she was hit with a sense of déjà vu, remembering years ago, back when she was stationed at NERV's German branch for a time and was appointed as Asuka's temporary guardian and they had a very similar interaction. After coming home one day and finding a young Asuka already watching a romance sitcom, Misato suggested to watch something more befitting her age and turned the channel to a cartoon, thinking Asuka would enjoy it. But she found out that was a huge mistake, given how the young redhead had been screaming at her.  
“哇…她真的和她妈妈一模一样，”美里心想，一种似曾相识的感觉涌上心头，回忆起多年前，当她在 NERV 的德国分部驻扎一段时间，被任命为明日香的临时监护人时，她们有过一次非常类似的互动。有一天回家时，发现小明日香已经在看一部爱情情景喜剧，美里建议看一些更适合她年龄的节目，于是换到了一个卡通频道，以为明日香会喜欢。但她很快发现这是个巨大的错误，因为那个年轻的红发女孩对着她大喊大叫。

"_I'm not a child! I'm an adult and I'll watch what I want to watch!"_  
“我不是小孩！我是成年人，我想看什么就看什么！”

After that incident, Misato all but kept out of Asuka's way and allowed the headstrong Eva pilot in training to do what she wanted. Granted, the two only interacted when they were at home and even back then the time spent together was very little, due to Asuka's training and her attending school and later college lessons on top. Eventually, after Misato was due to be moved back to Japan, she remembered how hollow the goodbye to each other had been.  
那次事件之后，美里几乎避开了明日香，任由这位倔强的 EVA 训练生随心所欲。当然，两人只有在家的时才会碰面，而且即便在家，相处时间也非常有限，因为明日香既要训练又要上学，后来还要上大学课程。最终，当美里即将被调回日本时，她回忆起两人之间那空洞的告别。

Looking back, she knew she could have done more to help Asuka back then. Even then she knew of Asuka's past and didn't do anything to help.  
回望过去，她知道自己本可以为当时的明日香做更多。即便那时她已知晓明日香的过往，却未曾采取任何行动去帮助她。

Just when she was thinking again about how terrible a mother she would be, she jumped when hearing Aki squeal in delight.  
正当她再次思索自己会是个多么糟糕的母亲时，听到阿基兴奋的尖叫声，她吓了一跳。

"It's my show! It's on, it's on!" Aki cheered and looked at the TV and from there Misato was able to see what show Aki was so interested in.  
“这是我的节目！开始了，开始了！”阿基欢呼着，目光转向电视，而美里则借此机会看清了阿基如此着迷的节目内容。

"Wait…it can't be…Sailor-Moon?!" Misato said in disbelief.  
"等等……不可能……是水兵月？！" 美里难以置信地说道。

"Auntie, you know it?" Aki questioned, briefly taking her eyes off the show for a second to look at the older woman, who got down on her knees to the floor to join Aki facing the TV, still in a state of disbelief and even a sense of happiness at what she was seeing.  
"阿姨，你也知道这个？" 阿基疑惑地问，短暂地将视线从电视上移开，看向那位跪坐在地板上，与阿基一同面对电视的年长女性。她仍处于难以置信的状态，甚至带着一丝喜悦，凝视着屏幕上的画面。

"I…yeah, I do kiddo. I used to watch this when I was a kid," Misato said as she kept her eyes on the TV screen and watched as the show's intro finished, confirming to the older purple-haired woman that this was the original show that she indeed grew up with.  
"我……是的，孩子，我知道。我小时候也看过这个，" 美里说着，目光始终停留在电视屏幕上，随着片头曲的结束，她确认了这就是她童年时看过的原版动画，那位紫发女子心中涌起了回忆。

Sitting down properly, she watched the show along with Aki and Misato was hit with a way of nostalgia, remembering when she was a little girl who was so excited to get up early in the morning and rush home after school to watch the next episode of Sailor-Moon. More memories resurfaced as she could now recall and remember the times that her mother and father were still happily married together, with the latter having not yet begun being over-obsessed with his work which led to their inevitable divorce.  
她端正地坐下，与 Aki 一起观看节目，Misato 被一种怀旧之情击中，想起了自己还是个小女孩时，多么兴奋能在清晨早早起床，放学后急忙赶回家观看《美少女战士》的下一集。更多的记忆浮现出来，她现在能回忆起父母还幸福地在一起的时光，那时父亲还没有开始过度沉迷于工作，导致他们不可避免的离婚。

Heck, Misato even remembered fondly that she had a whole bunch of stuff like dolls, costumes, posters and toys of the show as she was growing up, all of which she fondly remembered her begging her parents at the time to buy those things for her birthdays and Christmas.  
天哪，Misato 甚至还记得她小时候有一大堆关于这个节目的东西，比如娃娃、服装、海报和玩具，她都记得当时恳求父母在她的生日和圣诞节为她买这些东西。

As the adult and the child continued to watch the show, Misato could not help but smile. Despite the show having such classic cheesy and cliché hero moments, seeing it again after so many years made Misato feel like she got back a bit of childhood.  
当大人和孩子继续观看节目时，Misato 忍不住微笑。尽管这个节目有着经典的俗套英雄时刻，但多年后再次看到它，让 Misato 感觉找回了些许童年。

Giving a side glance at Aki, whose attention was purely on the show itself. She didn't miss a thing as she grabbed her piece of toast from the side and bit into it. Misato couldn't help but ruffle the girl's hair, to which Aki lightly growled in displeasure and swat Misato's hand away again not turning her attention away from the TV screen.  
侧目看向 Aki，她的注意力完全集中在节目上。她一点也没错过，从旁边拿起一片吐司咬了一口。Misato 忍不住揉了揉女孩的头发，Aki 不满地轻声咆哮，再次拍开 Misato 的手，目光始终未离开电视屏幕。

'Thanks, kiddo,' Misato silently thanked the brown-haired girl before turning back to the show herself.  
'谢谢你，小家伙，' Misato 默默地向那位棕发女孩道谢，然后自己也转回节目。

x-x-x-x

It turned out that the Sailor-Moon show was a double marathon that lasted a whole hour. So, when the show finally ended, Misato couldn't help but feel like she was a kid again. The show was exactly like she remembered it and even recalled having watched this particular episode in the past but still firmly enjoying seeing it again.  
结果发现《美少女战士》节目是一场持续整整一小时的双重马拉松。因此，当节目最终结束时，美里不禁觉得自己仿佛回到了童年。这部剧完全如她记忆中的那样，甚至记得自己曾经看过这一集，但再次观看依然乐在其中。

"Hey Auntie, can I ask something?" Aki asked as she turned to the woman next to her.  
“嘿，阿姨，我能问个问题吗？”阿基转向她旁边的女人问道。

"About what kiddo?" “关于什么，孩子？”

"How come when Sailor-Moon and the others change into their hero forms the bad guys don't just attack them while they're in the middle of it?" Aki wondered.  
“为什么当水兵月和其他人变身成英雄形态时，坏蛋们不趁他们还在变身中途就攻击他们呢？”阿基疑惑道。

The question made Misato take a moment to process. "…what?"  
这个问题让美里一时间有些反应不过来。“……什么？”

"I mean it takes a bit for Sailor-Moon and her friends a while to transform so why don't the bad guys just attack them when they have the chance?"  
“我是说，水兵月和她的朋友们变身需要一段时间，那为什么坏蛋们不抓住这个机会攻击他们呢？”

"Err…well I think it's more for us viewers, as the transformation scenes are just cool to look at but in the show, the transformation is instant for them," Misato explained.  
“呃…我觉得这对我们观众来说更有意义，因为变身场景看起来很酷，但在剧中，他们的变身是瞬间完成的，”Misato 解释道。

Luckily it looked like Aki accepted this answer as she nodded in agreement. "Oh yeah, that makes sense. Oh, next question! Why does Sailor-Moon do the hand thingy?"  
幸运的是，Aki 似乎接受了这一回答，她点头表示同意。“哦，对，这说得通。哦，下一个问题！为什么水兵月要做那个手势？”

"The hand what now?" Asked a confused Misato, not entirely sure what her "niece" was on about.  
“手势？什么手势？”Misato 困惑地问道，不太确定她的“侄女”在说什么。

Seeing Misato confused, Aki stood up where she was seated on the floor. "You know this hand thingy," Aki said as she shook and waved her arms about in a clumsy manner up until the end making Misato understand what she meant and also start chuckling to.  
看到美里困惑的样子，坐在地板上的秋站了起来。“你知道这个手势吧，”秋说着，笨拙地挥动双臂，直到最后让美里明白了她的意思，也开始咯咯笑起来。

"Ooh the Sailor-Moon hero pose," Misato said as she continued chuckling at Aki's clumsy attempt a moment ago, which was nothing like how the pose was supposed to go. "Yeah, the pose is just to look cool for us the viewer's, hun."  
“哦，是水兵月的英雄姿势，”美里一边继续笑着刚才秋笨拙的尝试，那完全不像应有的姿势。“是啊，那个姿势对我们观众来说只是为了看起来酷而已，亲爱的。”

Aki didn't comment on that, looking like she was in deep thought before getting into a position.  
秋没有对此发表评论，看起来像是在沉思，然后摆出了一个姿势。

"In the name of the moon! I'll punish you!" Aki exclaimed and tried to do the pose but once again she couldn't do the gesture right as before she just clumsily waved and shook her hands about. All this just made the older woman burst out laughing and making Aki pout in displeasure.  
"以月亮的名义！我要惩罚你！" 阿基喊道，试图摆出那个姿势，但又一次，她没能正确做出手势，只是笨拙地挥舞着双手。这一切只是让那位年长的女士爆发出笑声，让阿基不满地撅起了嘴。

"That's not how you do it," Misato's laughs died down to a chuckle again as she too stood up from the floor and manoeuvred so she had plenty of space to move. "It goes like this."  
"这不是你这样做的方式，" 美里笑得渐渐平息，又变成了一声轻笑，她从地板上站起来，调整位置以便有足够的空间移动。"应该是这样的。"

"In the name of the of the moon, I will punish you!" Misato declared as she did the pose perfectly.  
"以月亮的名义，我将惩罚你！" 美里宣告着，完美地摆出了那个姿势。

For a moment both the adult and child didn't say anything. Misato for her part was just surprised that she was able to do the pose at all considering she hadn't done something like this in years since she was a child herself. Aki for her part was just amazed as her "auntie" did the hero pose just as it was done on the show.  
一时间，大人和孩子都没有说话。Misato 自己也很惊讶，她居然还能做出这个姿势，毕竟她已经很多年没有做过类似的事情了，自从她还是个孩子的时候。而 Aki 则对她的“阿姨”能像电视上那样做出英雄姿势感到惊叹。

The stunned moment was finally broken when Aki started clapping her hands and hopping up and down in delight.  
当 Aki 开始兴奋地拍手并上下跳跃时，那震惊的瞬间终于被打破了。

"That's it, that's it! Do it again Auntie!" Aki excitedly demanded.  
“就是这样，就是这样！再做一次，阿姨！”Aki 兴奋地要求道。

Despite now being a little more self-conscious of how she now looked, her grown adult doing something silly she still went along with Aki's demand.  
尽管现在她对自己的滑稽样子感到有些不自在，但作为一个成年人，她还是顺从了 Aki 的要求。

"In the name of the moon, I'll punish you!" Misato did the pose again perfectly, although a bit slower as to make Aki see it and giving Aki squealed in delight showed that she still got the touch.  
“以月亮的名义，我要惩罚你！”美里再次完美地摆出了那个姿势，尽管稍微放慢了速度以便让秋看到，秋兴奋的尖叫声表明她依然保持着那份感觉。

"That was so cool Auntie Misato! How can you do it so good?" Aki questioned in excitement.  
“那真是太酷了，美里阿姨！你怎么能做得这么好？”秋兴奋地问道。

"Well…I was a huge fan when I was your age…and I thought back then that it would be cool to do the pose too," Misato admitted to the four-year-old before her. More memories of her childhood came to her mind as she remembered that she spent hours upon hours learning to do the Sailor-Moon pose and when she had perfected it, she remembered how she had embarrassed herself to her school friends at the time who either laughed or mocked her for copying a silly move from an anime at the time.  
"嗯…我像你这么大的时候是个超级粉丝…那时候我觉得模仿那个姿势也很酷，"美里对面前四岁的小孩坦白道。随着这段回忆，她想起了自己小时候花了无数个小时学习如何做出美少女战士的姿势，当她终于熟练掌握时，她记得自己当时是如何在学校朋友面前出丑的，他们要么嘲笑她，要么取笑她模仿当时一部动漫中的愚蠢动作。

"Teach me! Teach me to do it too, Auntie!" Aki asked in excitement.  
"教我！教我怎么做，阿姨！"阿基兴奋地请求道。

"Wait…you want to learn the pose too?" Misato questioned, surprised that Aki would ask her to learn such a silly and childish thing.  
"等等…你也想学这个姿势吗？"美里惊讶地问道，没想到阿基会要求学习这么幼稚的事情。

Aki nodded excitedly. "Yeah, please teach me, Auntie, then I can show my friends at kindergarten, especially Naota and Seita as they were the ones that told me about Sailor-Moon," Aki told Misato, remembering when the two boys told her about the show before both inevitably started arguing and even fighting over whether boys should be even watching a show about girls doing girly things besides the cool hero action stuff.  
阿基兴奋地点头。“嗯，请教我吧，阿姨，这样我就可以在幼儿园向我的朋友们展示，特别是直太和诚，因为他们是告诉我《美少女战士》的人。”阿基告诉美里，回想起那两个男孩在争论甚至打架之前告诉她这部动画的情景，争论男孩是否应该看关于女孩做女孩事情的节目，除了酷炫的英雄动作。

Misato wasn't sure at first. Again, remembered how she was teased, laughed and mocked for doing the pose back during her childhood but the hopeful puppy dog-eyed look from Aki looking up at her finally made her give in.  
美里一开始并不确定。她再次想起童年时因为做那个姿势而被取笑、嘲笑和嘲弄的情景，但阿基那充满希望的、像小狗一样渴望的眼神最终让她屈服了。

"Ok, I'll teach you how to do it," Misato said with Aki hopping happily like a puppy dog. "First off you start with your stance..."  
“好吧，我来教你该怎么做，”美里说，阿基像小狗一样高兴地跳了起来。“首先，你要从站姿开始……”

x-x-x

For about thirty minutes or so, Misato proceeded to teach Aki the moves of the Sailor-Moon pose. Surprisingly Aki quickly learned how to manoeuvre and coordinate her arms in the right way till in no time at all she was able to do the pose perfectly.  
大约三十分钟左右，美里开始教秋如何做出美少女战士的姿势。令人惊讶的是，秋很快就学会了如何正确地移动和协调她的手臂，不久她就能完美地做出这个姿势了。

"In the name of the moon, I will punish you!" Aki declared.  
“以月亮的名义，我要惩罚你！”秋宣告道。

"That's it, Aki you did it!" Misato cheered.  
“就是这样，秋，你做到了！”美里欢呼道。

"Yay, I did it, I did it!" Aki happily cheered before going up to the purple-haired woman, quickly giving her a hug, surprising Misato, but she did not hesitate to hug the girl back. Breaking the hug Aki looked at Misato with a wide grin. "Let's do it together!"  
"耶，我做到了，我做到了！" 阿基高兴地欢呼着，跑到紫发女子面前，迅速给了她一个拥抱，让美里感到意外，但她没有犹豫，立刻回抱了女孩。阿基松开拥抱，对着美里露出了灿烂的笑容。"我们一起做吧！"

Seeing no harm, Misato got into position next to Aki. "Ok, you ready?" Misato asked her little companion beside her, which Aki nodded before getting into position too.  
看到没有危险，美里站到了阿基旁边。"好了，准备好了吗？"美里问她身边的小同伴，阿基点了点头，也摆好了姿势。

"In the name of the moon, I will punish you," both surrogate aunt and niece said in sync in voice and moves.  
"以月亮的名义，我要惩罚你，"代理阿姨和侄女异口同声地说着，动作也同步一致。

Both parties froze then they heard clapping behind them and turned to see both Asuka and Shinji, up and fully awake, with the former being the one clapping.  
双方都僵住了，随后听到身后传来鼓掌声，转身一看，是明日香和真嗣，两人都醒了，精神饱满，鼓掌的是明日香。

"Good job you two," Asuka said while smirking at the two, especially at Misato as she finished clapping. Shinji next to her was giving a small smile while scratching his cheek.  
“干得不错，你们俩，”明日香一边说着，一边对两人，尤其是对美里，露出得意的笑容。站在她旁边的真嗣则带着一丝微笑，挠了挠脸颊。

Misato could not help but blush in embarrassment at being caught in such a manner, Aki however just ran happily towards her mother.  
美里不禁脸红，感到尴尬，被这样抓个正着，而阿基则开心地跑向她的母亲。

"Mama, Papa!" Aki happily hugged her mother's hip, not feeling an ounce of embarrassment like Misato was feeling. "Guten Morgen!"  
"妈妈，爸爸！" 阿基开心地抱住妈妈的腰，丝毫没有像美里那样感到尴尬。"早上好！"

"Guten Morgen, Schätzchen." Asuka gave her daughter's hair a gentle stroke. "I see you were having fun with Auntie Misato," Asuka said while giving Misato another smirk. "I didn't know you were a Sailor-Moon fan, Misato."  
"早上好，宝贝。" 明日香轻轻抚摸着女儿的头发。"看来你和美里阿姨玩得很开心，" 明日香说着，又向美里投去一个得意的眼神。"我不知道你还是个《美少女战士》的粉丝，美里。"

"I... I'm not really a fan, ok? I was just helping the little munchkin learn how to do the moves," Misato tried denying, hoping to save face.  
"我……我其实不是粉丝，好吗？我只是帮这个小家伙学习怎么做出那些动作，" 美里试图否认，希望能挽回面子。"

"But Auntie you said you were a huge fan?" Aki questioned, looking back as she let go of her mother. Asuka couldn't help but snicker.  
"但阿姨，你不是说你是超级粉丝吗？" 阿基质疑道，回头看着她放开了母亲的手。明日香忍不住窃笑。

"Geez, thanks for having my back you little gremlin," Misato whispered, peeved that her surrogate niece didn't help have her back.  
"天哪，谢谢你这个小捣蛋鬼帮我撑腰，" 美里低声抱怨，恼火她的代理侄女没有帮她撑腰。

Sensing the mood, Shinji decided to make his way to the kitchen. "I'll start making breakfast," Shinji announced.  
感觉到气氛的变化，真嗣决定去厨房。"我去准备早餐，" 真嗣宣布道。

Soon after breakfast was quickly made in the span of a few minutes, courtesy of Shinji and while everyone was eating in peace, Misato thought back to her previous thoughts on being a mother. Her confidence had been boosted now after spending time with Aki, making her realise that maybe she could do this.  
早餐在几分钟内迅速完成，这要归功于真嗣，而当大家安静地用餐时，美里回想起之前关于成为母亲的思考。与秋共度的时光增强了她的信心，让她意识到也许自己能够做到这一点。

"I'm finished!" Aki declared, being the first to finish eating. Shinji was next to finish and took his and Aki's plate and went to the counter to wash up, while Aki got down from her seat and followed him.  
"我吃完了！" 阿基宣布道，她是第一个吃完的。真嗣紧随其后，拿起自己和阿基的盘子去柜台清洗，而阿基则从座位上下来，跟在他后面。

Now with only Misato and Asuka still at the table, the former looked at the redheaded mother till eventually the latter realised she was being stared at.  
现在只剩下美里和明日香还在桌旁，前者看着红发的母亲，直到后者终于意识到自己正在被注视。

"Do I have something on my face?" Asuka asked, wondering what Misato could be thinking.  
"我脸上有东西吗？" 明日香问道，不知道美里在想什么。

"I…I wanted to say I'm sorry Asuka."  
"我……我想说对不起，明日香。"

"Come again?" a visibly confused Asuka asked.  
"再说一遍？" 明日香明显困惑地问。

"You know from back when I was your guardian in Germany those years ago. I read your file back then and I knew you were this kid that desperately needed help, but I failed to understand you, let alone help you. In the end, I just left you to your own devices, thinking you were stronger than you appeared to be when it couldn't have been further from the truth. In the end, I didn't help you when I could have done more," Misato explained, her voice filled with regret.  
"你知道，从多年前我在德国做你监护人的时候起。那时我读过你的档案，知道你是个迫切需要帮助的孩子，但我没能理解你，更别提帮助你了。最终，我只是让你自生自灭，以为你比外表看起来要坚强，但实际上远非如此。最终，我没能在你需要时给予更多帮助，" 美里解释道，声音中充满了懊悔。

"…Misato, it's ok," Asuka said with a comforting smile dawning on her face.  
“…美里，没关系的，”明日香脸上绽放出一个安慰的微笑说道。

"But it's not okay..." Misato tried to say but was cut off when Asuka lifted her hand as a sign to stop.  
“但这样不对……”美里试图说些什么，但被明日香举起的手势打断了。

"I said it's ok, Misato," Asuka repeated in a firmer voice. "I know you feel guilty about how you handled me, but the truth is, even if you had tried to help me back then…it wouldn't have made a difference. I was an emotional mess, and I would have pushed you further away if you'd tried to help me, even if deep down I wanted somebody to comfort and help me," Asuka said as she made a bitter smile.  
“我说了没关系，美里，”明日香用更坚定的语气重复道，“我知道你对我当时的处理方式感到内疚，但事实是，即使你那时试图帮助我……也不会有什么改变。我当时情绪一团糟，如果你试图帮助我，我反而会更疏远你，尽管内心深处我渴望有人安慰和帮助我，”明日香苦笑着说道。

"The sad thing is that it took this whole Angel war breaking me mentally and emotionally, bringing me to my lowest point, not to mention the end of the world and finally having a certain Baka Shinji who had the courage to be there for me to make me realise that…that I didn't have to be alone, that I could rely on on someone and be honest with myself."  
“可悲的是，这一切都是因为天使战争让我在精神和情感上崩溃，让我跌至谷底，更不用说世界末日了，最后还有一个笨蛋真嗣有勇气陪在我身边，才让我意识到……我不必独自一人，我可以依靠某个人，可以对自己诚实。”

"…Asuka," Misato said, a bit speechless, not knowing what to say.  
“……明日香，”美里有些语塞，不知该说什么。

"So again, it's ok Misato as I forgive you…but if you still feel the need to make it up to me then just continue being a great aunt to my little Schätzchen, ok?" Asuka finished with a smile at Misato who eventually smiled back at her.  
"所以，Misato，我再次原谅你，但如果你仍觉得需要补偿我，那就继续做一个好姑姑，好好照顾我的小宝贝，好吗？" 明日香笑着对美里说，美里最终也回以微笑。

"In the name of the moon, I'll punish you, Papa!"  
"以月亮的名义，我要惩罚你，爸爸！"

Asuka and Misato both looked over and laughed upon seeing Aki doing the Sailor-Moon pose towards Shinji, who was still busy washing the dishes. He only gave a confused chuckle, wondering why he was being punished exactly.  
明日香和美里看到爱希对着正在洗碗的 Shinji 摆出美少女战士的姿势，都笑了起来。他只是困惑地笑了笑，不明白自己为什么会被惩罚。

For those who new or don't/didn't know the Japanese VA, Kotono Mitsuishi who voices Misato Katsuragi from Evangelion also voiced the character Sailor-Moon from the series namesake, so this chapter is a meta joke in a way, plus liked the idea of Misato being a fan of Sailor-Moon as a child, thus how the chapter came to be.  
对于那些不了解或不知道的日本声优，为《新世纪福音战士》中的赤木律子配音的三石琴乃，同时也是《美少女战士》系列同名角色月野兔的声优，因此这个chapter在某种程度上是一个元笑话，再加上喜欢赤木律子小时候是美少女战士粉丝的想法，从而形成了这个chapter。
