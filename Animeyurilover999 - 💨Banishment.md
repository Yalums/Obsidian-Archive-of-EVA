My personal interpretation of the thoughts stirring around in Asuka's mind in episode 24. As such, it may be safe to consider this an AU.  
这是我个人对第 24 集中明日香脑海中翻涌思绪的解读。因此，可以认为这是一个平行世界设定。

(以下内容与作者无关)

愤怒是一种防御机制，用来保护 Asuka 脆弱的自我，没有人理解或重视她，感到完全孤立无援，就像被 NERV 和那些她认为是盟友的人抛弃了。
她质疑自己的身份和价值，在 "弱者 "的概念中挣扎，这与她一直以来对自己的看法背道而驰，绝望与困惑，无法理解自己的处境，也找不到摆脱情绪波动的方法。
也许她需要让自己感受并处理自己的情绪，包括愤怒、悲伤和恐惧。压抑这些情绪只会延长她的痛苦，这需要她挑战对自己和他人的消极想法和信念、识别和重构认知扭曲。

Asuka 可以花时间反思她过去的行为和情感，理解她的愤怒、挫败感和孤独感的根源。通过深入了解自己，她可以开始质疑这些消极的自我认知（摒弃弗洛伊德精神创伤理论，尝试从个体心理学的角度识别既有的能力与性格特征，采用一定的正念治疗，记录自己的情感和想法、理清思绪，以更客观的方式审视自己的内心世界）。
- 重新定义自我价值，Eva不是全部，寻找新的兴趣和目标，不再仅仅依赖 Eva 驾驶员的身份来定义自我价值。她可以尝试各种活动，找到自己擅长和喜欢的事情，从中获得成就感和满足感。
- 与Shinji进行坦诚的对话，分享彼此的感受和经历。这有助于她了解Shinji的动机和情感，从而减少对他的误解和敌意，通过互相倾听和理解，他们可以建立一种新的、更健康的关系模式。
- 走出“全或无”的思维方式（即认为自己要么完全成功，要么完全失败）等认知扭曲，将负面思维转化为更现实和积极的思维，利用理性思维，质疑这些消极的信念，并寻找证据支持更积极的看法。

How long had it been since Asuka had fled from both NERV and all of the people she knew? She was honestly unable to tell; every day since the last Angel incident had become a blur. She wasn't given the opportunity to even see the battle to the end before being lowered back into headquarters. Misato, Ikari… they all saw her as useless; no longer able to fight. What good was the Evangelion if she couldn't even pilot it? Its purpose was to obey her commands, wasn't it? That's what it was built to do. So then why didn't it move? Why did it no longer accept her? Why did it have the ability to ignore her in the first place?  
自从明日香逃离 NERV 和她所认识的所有人以来，已经过去多久了？她真的无法确定；自上次使徒事件以来，每一天都变得模糊不清。在被送回总部之前，她甚至没有机会看到战斗的结局。美里、碇……他们都认为她无用；再也无法战斗。如果她连驾驶都不能，那 EVA 还有什么用？它的目的不就是服从她的命令吗？这就是它被建造的原因。那么为什么它不动了？为什么它不再接受她？为什么它一开始就有能力忽视她？

So many questions that she would most likely never receive the answers to, though none of it really mattered anymore. She had no intention of going back. There were no understanding faces. She had nowhere to call home; nowhere she felt comfortable. The only place she had once considered her safe haven no longer accepted her. She wasn't a true priority to NERV and had never really been; all the attention had been given to the idiot and that _damned doll_. What was it about that emotionless girl that had attracted so much attention from Ikari? He favored her over his own son, though Asuka never showed any sympathy to the boy. He didn't deserve any.  
太多问题，她很可能永远得不到答案，尽管这一切现在都不再重要。她无意回去。没有理解的面孔。她无处可归，无处感到自在。曾经视为避风港的地方也不再接纳她。她对 NERV 来说从来不是真正的优先，所有的关注都给了那个白痴和那该死的玩偶。那个无情的女孩究竟有什么魅力吸引了碇的注意？他偏爱她胜过自己的儿子，尽管明日香从未对那男孩表示过同情。他不配得到任何东西。

Shinji hardly looked her way. It was always about gaining praise from Misato, his father… from anyone aside from herself. Her words didn't matter. They never mattered. All she ever had was her Eva. That piece of junk was her only source of happiness; whether it was sincere or only a temporary escape was irrelevant. Fighting in that robot and showing off her potential as a pilot was her reason for being. It made her feel alive. It helped to ground her to reality.  
真嗣几乎不曾看她一眼。他总是为了从美里、他父亲……从任何人那里得到赞扬，除了她自己。她的话无关紧要。从来都不重要。她唯一拥有的只有她的 EVA。那堆破铜烂铁是她唯一的快乐源泉；无论是真心还是暂时的逃避都无关紧要。在那机器人里战斗，展示她作为驾驶员的潜力，是她存在的理由。这让她感到活着。这帮助她脚踏实地面对现实。

Was she insane for feeling that way; for gaining such immense pleasure from spilling blood? Was it acceptable to smile at her work? Though the Angels were their enemy, Asuka never really considered them as such. She viewed them as little more than opportunities for others to potentially stare at her display of abilities in awe. She wanted them to never again underestimate her skills and instead accept how valuable she was on the battlefield.  
她那样感觉是疯了吗？从流血中获得如此巨大的快感？对她的工作微笑是可以接受的吗？尽管天使是他们的敌人，但明日香从未真正将他们视为敌人。她认为他们不过是别人可能惊叹于她展示能力的契机。她希望他们永远不要再低估她的技能，而是接受她在战场上的价值。

...Why had it fallen apart? Along with losing the ability to pilot she had in turn lost her source of happiness, her self-confidence, her pride, and her world. She was alone. The wrecked house she had claimed and the lack of anyone by her side was all the proof she needed. She wasn't sure if she would ever regain the will to see them again. How could she face them in her current state? What could she even say to them? That she was sorry, that she would continue trying until it killed her? That she appreciated their presence? All they were good for was boosting her pride. If they no longer valued her skills and efforts, then they didn't deserve her. Especially not when she was so weakened.  
……为什么一切都崩溃了？随着失去驾驶能力，她也失去了她的快乐源泉、自信、骄傲和世界。她孤身一人。她所占据的破败房屋和身边无人陪伴就是她需要的所有证明。她不确定自己是否还会重新找回见他们的意愿。以她现在的状态，她怎么能面对他们？她又能对他们说什么？说她很抱歉，说她会继续尝试直到死去？说她感激他们的存在？他们所能做的只是提升她的骄傲。如果他们不再重视她的技能和努力，那么他们就不配拥有她。尤其是当她如此虚弱的时候。

...Weak. That was one word the girl had never even considered to describe herself. Proud? Yes. Skillful? Yes. But weak…?  
...软弱。这个词女孩从未想过会用来形容自己。骄傲吗？是的。技艺高超吗？是的。但软弱…？

...What had become of her? Why did her fate have to be so cruel? What did she do to deserve this? Where was the blood coming from? She didn't know. She didn't know anything. She didn't _want_ to know anything. This never should have happened, and it never would have happened if it weren't for those around her.  
...她怎么了？为什么她的命运如此残酷？她做了什么要承受这些？血是从哪里来的？她不知道。她什么都不想知道。这一切本不该发生，如果不是因为周围的人，这一切也不会发生。

Yes, that was it. It was the damn emotionless puppet's fault. It was that idiot's fault. It was the fault of Misato, Ikari, Ritsuko… everyone. She would have been just fine without them. She didn't need their assistance in combat. She was capable of handling the Angels just fine on her own. Damn Misato for encouraging her and Shinji to take out the enemy together. Damn the doll for straying attention away from her. Damn the others for not recognizing her skills.  
是的，就是这样。都是那个该死的无感情傀儡的错。都是那个白痴的错。都是美里、碇、律子……所有人的错。没有他们，她会过得很好。她不需要他们在战斗中的帮助。她完全有能力独自应对使徒。该死的美里鼓励她和真嗣一起出击。该死的傀儡分散了她的注意力。该死的其他人没有认识到她的能力。

Damn Shinji for not being hers.  
该死的真嗣，为什么不是她的。

Why did he have to look at Rei that way? Why did she smile at him? And most of all… why did he smile back?  
他为什么要那样看着丽？她为什么对他微笑？而最重要的是……他为什么还要回以微笑？

Why wasn't she enough? What did she lack? Why was it stirring so many emotions inside of her?  
为什么她不够好？她缺少了什么？为什么这会在她内心激起如此多的情感？

She was an idiot. She had to be. She was no better than Shinji. After all, she had ran away, didn't she? And after the many times she had called him a coward…  
她真是个傻瓜。肯定是。她并不比真嗣强。毕竟，她自己也逃跑了，不是吗？而且她还多次骂他是懦夫……

There was no way in hell she could face him now.  
现在她绝对无法面对他。

There was no way she could do anything.  
她什么都做不了。
