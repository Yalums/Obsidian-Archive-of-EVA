**School 学府**

Boredom. 感到无聊。

With one word, Asuka could describe how she feels at the moment. If there were a competition for boring people, their teacher would be second to none.  
仅凭一个词，明日香便能准确表达她此刻的心情。若真有无聊人士的较量，他们的老师必定无人能出其右。

'Can he start talking about something else?' She was sick of hearing about the Second Impact. To her, it was like their teacher had stopped in time at that one event.  
'他能否换个话题？' 她对第二次冲击的讨论已感到厌烦。在她看来，老师似乎永远停留在那个事件上，时间不再前进。

Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that she wasn't the only one who was bored. Shinji was looking out the window, and he wasn't the only one.  
她用眼角余光察觉到，感到无聊的不止她一人。真嗣正凝视着窗外，他并非孤例。

Suddenly, the whole class seemed to come alive when they heard the bell ring.  
铃声一响，全班同学仿佛都活跃了起来。

"Tomorrow we will continue the topic." The teacher got up from his seat and left the classroom.  
"明天我们将继续探讨这个话题。" 老师起身离开了教室。

"Finally". Asuka whispered to herself.  
"终于啊。" 明日香轻声自语。

"Want to get lunch?" When Asuka lifted her gaze, she saw Hikari. She stood over Asuka's desk with her lunch box.  
"想一起吃午饭吗？"明日香抬头一看，发现光正站在她的桌边，手里拿着午餐盒。

"Sure." 当然。

Asuka grabbed her bag and pulled out her lunch. They left the room and traversed the school grounds. It became an informal tradition that they ate together, as Hikari was the only person Asuka could truly say was her friend.  
明日香拿起背包，取出午餐。两人离开教室，漫步于校园之中。一起吃饭逐渐成为他们之间不成文的惯例，因为光是明日香唯一可以称之为知己的人。

Hikari was very likable. The other students addressed her very formally, which sometimes annoyed her. Asuka was never formal towards her. Perhaps that was why she enjoyed spending lunch breaks with her.  
光深受大家喜爱。其他同学对她总是毕恭毕敬，有时让她感到不自在。而飞鸟对她则从不拘泥于礼节。或许正因如此，她特别喜欢和飞鸟共度午餐时光。

They sat comfortably near a tree that cast a shadow over them. Hikari looked at Asuka's bento and couldn't help but comment.  
他们惬意地坐在树荫下，光瞥见明日香的便当，不禁开口评论。

"I see Shinji has prepared lunch again."  
看来真嗣又把午餐准备好了。

"He does every day." Not caring about the comment, Asuka grabbed her chopsticks and began to eat her meal. She could feel Hikari's gaze on her and it irritated her. "What?"  
他每天都这样。" 无视评论，Asuka 拿起筷子开始享用她的餐点。她能察觉到 Hikari 的注视，这让她有些不悦。"什么事？

"Do you know how many girls at school envy you? That Shinji prepares food for you?"  
你可知道，学校里有多少女生羡慕你？真嗣亲自为你下厨。

She did know. She liked it when they talked about her, and she liked it even more when they envied her. What she didn't understand was what they might be jealous of. Food? Food was nothing special. Maybe a little better than what they sell at school.  
她确实知道。她喜欢别人谈论她，更喜欢别人羡慕她。她不明白的是，他们可能会嫉妒她什么。食物吗？食物也没什么特别的，可能只是比学校卖的好一点而已。

"If you envy me, ask him. He also cooks for Wondergirl. He'd probably cook for you too."  
若你羡慕我，不妨问问他。他同样为 Wondergirl 下厨。说不定也会为你烹饪。

"Oh no no, it's not the same thing." Hikari said. She laughed, to Asuka's surprise. "I don't remember him giving lunch to Ayanami before you arrived."  
哎呀，这可不一样。"光笑着说，让明日香颇感意外。"我印象中，你来之前他可没给绫波送过午饭。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

Asuka enjoyed eating with her friend, but it was starting to annoy her a little that every lunch started with a conversation about her roommate.  
明日香虽然喜欢与朋友共餐，但每次午餐话题总是从她的室友开始，这让她渐渐感到有些不快。

"Don't you think maybe he wants to cook for you, but just so it's not so obvious, he cooks for Ayanami too?" The expression on Asuka's face was enough for an answer.  
"你没想过吗？或许他也想为你下厨，只是为了显得不那么刻意，才连带着也给绫波做了。"明日香的神情已不言而喻。

"Give me a break. Like I would bother with some boring little boy. I want Kaji."  
让我喘口气吧。我怎么可能对一个无聊的小男孩感兴趣，我想要的是卡吉。

Hikari shook her head. She wasn't sure how many times she had heard that. Still, she tried to convince her friend that it was pointless.  
光摇摇头，她记不清这是第几次听到了。尽管如此，她仍努力向朋友解释，这样做是徒劳的。

"I know, I know. But you said it yourself that you don't actually see him. And if you do see him, he's always with Miss Misato. Besides, he is much older than you. He's an adult and you're still a teenager."  
我明白，我明白。可你不是说过自己其实没怎么见过他吗？即便碰见了，他身边也总跟着美里小姐。再说了，他比你年长许多，已经是成年人了，而你还只是个青少年。

'I hate it when everyone treats me like a child!'  
'我真不喜欢大家总把我当小孩子看待！'

Asuka clenched her hand tighter on the chopsticks. She said nothing, but a scowl appeared on her face. When Hikari saw her reaction, she fell silent. She didn't want to offend her. Her comment was only out of concern. For Hikari, chasing an older man was just a childish crush, nothing more.  
明日香紧握手中的筷子，默不作声，脸上却显露出不悦。光见状，便不再言语，生怕触怒了她。光的评论本意是出于关心，在她看来，追逐年长男性不过是孩子气的迷恋罢了。

It was different with Shinji. He was her age. Hikari didn't know him very well personally, but from the way Asuka's talked about him, it was clear she knew him all too well. Asuka wouldn't admit it, of course, but Shinji had a tendency to come up a lot. It was mostly complaints about him, but there was something strange about them.  
真嗣的情况则有所不同。他和她年纪相仿。光对真嗣个人了解不多，但从明日香谈论他的语气中可以明显感觉到，她对他知之甚详。尽管明日香不会明说，但真嗣的名字频繁出现。虽然多半是抱怨，但这些抱怨中似乎隐藏着某种微妙。

"Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."  
抱歉，我无意冒犯。

Asuka turned to face Hikari and in doing so, disturbed her. Not so much the movement, but the expression on her face. There was a sly smile on her face that did not foretell anything good. A shiver ran down Hikari's spine. This didn't bode well. And she wasn't wrong.  
明日香转过身来面对光，这个动作让她感到不安。更让她不安的是明日香脸上的表情，那狡黠的微笑显然预示着不妙。光不由得打了个寒颤，直觉告诉她这不是好兆头。她的预感没错。

"Are you going to change the subject or should I do it myself? Let me warn you that you won't like it." An even more sly smile was painted on Asuka's face.  
"你是打算换个话题，还是我自己动手？先告诉你，你不会喜欢的。" 明日香的脸上露出了更加狡猾的微笑。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

Hikari's nervousness was very evident. Asuka was sometimes getting angry. She knew it from her own experience. She had witnessed her rage, mostly towards Shinji. This time it was different. She was suspiciously calm and it worried Hikari.  
光里的紧张情绪显而易见。明日香偶尔会发怒，她对此深有体会。她曾多次目睹明日香对真嗣发火。但这次情况有异，明日香异常冷静，这让光里感到不安。

"How are things going with Suzuhara?"  
铃原那边的情况怎么样了？

"What? How? I..." Hikari blushed and was shocked. How did Asuka know she had a crush on Toji? She didn't tell anyone. Not to his sister, not to her, not to anyone. "H-How did you know?"  
什么？怎么会？我..." 光脸颊泛红，震惊不已。明日香怎么会知道她对东治有好感？她可谁都没透露过。无论是东治的妹妹，还是其他人，她都守口如瓶。"你...你是怎么知道的？

"I see you staring." 我注意到你在盯着看。

"Don't tell anyone, please."  
请不要告诉任何人。

Hikari felt her face cloud up with heat. She hadn't expected anyone to notice the way she looked at Toji. "Let's change the subject."  
光感到脸颊因羞涩而发热。她未曾料到会有人察觉她凝视藤二的眼神。"我们换个话题吧。"

"I knew you'd understand."  
我就知道你会明白的。

"You know, all I wanted to say was just that you two-" Hikari paused, seeing her friend's death stare. She nodded as a sign that she definitely wanted to change the subject.  
"其实，我本想说的是关于你们俩的事——" 光顿了顿，察觉到朋友那冷冽的目光。她点头示意，确实想转移话题。

"So, are we meeting up after school? Today's Friday, and I could use a break after this boring week."  
放学后咱们见个面怎么样？今天周五了，这周过得挺乏味的，我正想放松放松。

"Sorry Asuka. My dad's away on a business trip for the weekend, and Kodama's working. I'll be taking care of my little sister."  
抱歉，明日香。我爸爸这周末因公出差，小田也在忙工作。我得照看我的小妹妹。

"Eh, that's a shame." 哎，真遗憾。

Asuka sighed. She had hoped to spend some time with Hikari. She had no other friends, and Kaji never picked up.  
明日香叹了口气。她原本期待能与光共度时光。她没有其他朋友，而卡吉总是不接电话。

**Misato's apartment 美里小姐的公寓**
"We're back." Shinji's voice echoed through the empty apartment.  
"我们回来了。" 真嗣的声音在空无一人的公寓里回荡。

Receiving no response, he kicked off his shoes and headed for the kitchen with bags full of groceries. He placed them on the table next to a message written on a piece of paper. He grabbed the piece of paper to read it.  
未获回应，他脱下鞋子，提着装满食品的袋子走进厨房。将袋子搁在桌上，旁边是一张留有信息的纸条。他随即拿起纸条细读。

Asuka entered the kitchen a moment behind him.  
明日香比他晚一步进入了厨房。

"What does it say?" 它上面写着什么？

"Misato wrote not to wait for her with dinner and that she would be back late." Shinji began unpacking his groceries.  
"Misato 留言说不用等她吃晚饭，她会回来得很晚。" 于是，Shinji 开始整理他的购物袋。

"She's probably with Kaji."  
她大概和卡吉在一起。

The disappointment was slightly audible in her voice, but Shinji didn't notice it. He continued unpacking his purchases. Asuka grabbed a pack of chips and headed toward her room.  
她的声音里隐约透出失望，但真嗣并未留意。他继续整理刚买的东西。明日香拿起一包薯片，径直走向自己的房间。

"When should I make dinner?"  
我该何时准备晚餐？

"I'm not hungry right now."  
我现在还不饿。

She disappeared into her room before he had time to react.  
她还没等他反应过来，就消失在了自己的房间里。

---

Asuka was sitting at her desk going through movie trailers on her laptop. Not only was she looking for something to watch to kill the boredom, but also her thoughts.  
明日香坐在桌前，用笔记本电脑翻看电影预告片。她这么做，既是为了找点消遣来打发无聊时光，也是为了转移自己的注意力。

She thought about Kaji. She knew that there was too much of an age difference between them and that he didn't take her seriously. It had gotten to her some time ago. She had even partially come to terms with it. Today's conversation with Hikari was like tearing open a wound.  
她想起了卡吉。她深知两人年龄悬殊，而他从未真正将她放在心上。这心结早已悄然扎根。她甚至已逐渐学会接受。然而，今日与光子的交谈，却如同揭开了旧伤疤，隐隐作痛。

She kept browsing, but no movie seemed interesting. She also looked through the television program, but found nothing interesting there either.  
她不断翻看，却找不到一部吸引她的电影。电视节目单也浏览了一遍，同样没发现什么吸引人的内容。

'Maybe I'll at least watch some dumb video.'  
'或许我至少会看些无脑视频消遣一下。'

Looking through various videos, she chose one whose thumbnail seemed funny. Before the video, commercials were displayed that annoyed the girl. She was about to skip the ad when a new one appeared. It was about a game. Some sort of role-playing game. Fantasy or medieval, she wasn't sure. She smiled under her breath as she saw the advertising slogans that praised the game. The game didn't look bad, it was just the hackneyed slogans.  
翻看了多个视频，她挑中了一个缩略图颇为逗趣的。视频开始前，播放的广告让她感到不耐烦。就在她准备跳过广告之际，一则新广告映入眼帘。这是一款角色扮演游戏的宣传。风格偏向奇幻还是中世纪，她一时难以分辨。看到那些夸赞游戏的广告词，她忍不住轻声笑了出来。游戏本身倒是不差，只是那些老套的广告词让人有些出戏。

'How typical. It's probably some terrible garbage.'  
'真是典型的。估计又是些糟糕透顶的东西。'

She looked up the review out of curiosity, wanting to see if she was right. She read some reviews and was mildly surprised. They were complimentary. As she looked through more descriptions from players, she saw a notice that the game was free for two weeks due to the release of an expansion pack.  
出于好奇，她查看了评论，想验证自己的想法。阅读了几篇评论后，她略感意外，因为它们都是好评。在浏览更多玩家描述时，她发现一则通知，提到因扩展包上线，游戏将免费开放两周。

With nothing better to do, she thought she'd try out this game. After a brief moment, a welcome screen appeared.  
闲来无事，她决定试玩一下这款游戏。不一会儿，欢迎屏幕就展现在眼前。

When it came to choosing a character, the choice seemed simple. Warrior. Brute strength, her style. It worked on angels. Well, usually. Now all that was left was to choose a name for the character. She thought about a few options, but they seemed cheesy to her. In the end, she decided, RedQueen.  
选择角色时，她毫不犹豫地选了“战士”。凭借蛮力，她的风格总能克制天使，至少大多数时候如此。接下来是为角色命名，她想了几个名字，但都觉得不够好。最终，她决定采用“红皇后”。

An animation appeared before the gameplay. It was a scene of fighting between the hero and some monster. Just a typical fight, nothing special. But there was something in that fight that caught Asuka's attention. It was the hero's sword. A beautifully drawn blade, burning with fire. She wondered if it was possible to own one. She really liked that fiery glow of the sword.  
游戏开始前，一段动画映入眼帘。画面中，英雄正与怪物激战。这场战斗并无特别之处，但英雄手中的剑却吸引了明日香的目光。那是一把绘制得美轮美奂的剑，剑身燃烧着熊熊火焰。她不禁幻想，是否有一天自己也能拥有这样一把剑。那剑上跳跃的火光，她实在爱不释手。

The game started and the introduction came on. It explained the basics, but she was impatient.  
游戏启动后，开场介绍立即播放。虽然介绍了基本规则，她却显得急不可耐。

'Give me the opponents! I'll slay them all!'  
'把对手交给我！我要将他们一网打尽！'

Asuka defeated several opponents. She completed the first quest and then the second. The game was beginning to appeal to her more and more. She completed several more quests.  
明日香接连战胜了数名对手。她先是完成了首个任务，随后又完成了第二个。游戏对她而言愈发引人入胜，她又陆续完成了几个任务。

Time passed in defeating more enemies when she heard a knock on the door.  
在击退更多敌人的间隙，她听到了敲门声。

"Dinner's ready." 晚饭好了。

It was Shinji's voice. She wanted to say she wasn't hungry, but that wasn't true. When she looked at the clock, only then did it occur to her how much time had passed. That was a surprise.  
那是真嗣的声音。她本想说自己不饿，可这并非真心话。直到她瞥见时钟，才恍然大悟时间流逝了多少。这着实让她吃了一惊。

"Coming." 就要来了。

---

When she entered the kitchen, Shinji was already sitting at the table eating dinner. She sat down at the table and looked at the plate in front of her. Looking at the dinner like this, she recalled her earlier conversation with Hikari.  
她走进厨房，发现真嗣已坐在桌旁享用晚餐。她随即落座，凝视着面前的餐盘，脑海中不禁浮现出与光子之前的交谈。

"Is something wrong?" Shinji seemed worried.  
"出了什么问题吗？" 新二显得有些担忧。

"No, nothing." She grabbed her chopsticks and began to eat her dinner.  
"没事，没什么。"她拿起筷子，开始享用晚餐。

They ate dinner in silence, not speaking to each other. Asuka raised her eyes and looked at Shinji for a moment. He was busy eating and didn't notice that she was looking at him. It was a bit of a strange sight. They lived together and she saw him every day, but she had not looked at him so closely before. His hair slightly covered his face when he had his head bowed.  
他们默默地共进晚餐，彼此间没有言语交流。明日香抬起头，目光短暂地停留在真嗣身上。他正专心用餐，未曾察觉她的注视。这一幕略显异样。尽管同住一个屋檐下，日日相见，她却从未如此细致地端详过他。他低头时，发丝轻柔地遮掩了面庞。

'Did he always have such uncombed hair?'  
'他是不是一直这样头发凌乱？'

She watched for another moment, when suddenly the boy raised his head. She was startled and quickly went back to eating.  
她又观察了一会儿，突然间男孩抬起头。她吃了一惊，随即继续用餐。

"Are you sure you're okay?" He seemed genuinely concerned.  
"你真的没事吗？"他显得十分关切。

Trying not to panic, she tried to think of an excuse. Without thinking long, she blurted out.  
她努力保持镇定，急忙寻找借口。没来得及深思，话已脱口而出。

"Did you feed PenPen?" 你给 PenPen 喂食了吗？

"Yes, before. Now he's asleep."  
是的，他之前醒着，现在睡着了。

Shinji was a little surprised when she asked about the pet. He did not remember that she had been interested in him before. Without thinking about it too long, he went back to eating.  
她突然问起宠物，让真嗣略感意外。他没印象她以前对他有兴趣。他没多想，继续埋头吃饭。

'That was close.' 真是好险。

Just why did Asuka actually care if he caught her looking? After all, she could laugh at him for imagining things if he asked. It was Hikari's fault. She was messing with her head.  
明日香为何如此在意他是否察觉到她的偷看？其实，若他提起，她大可笑他多心。这一切都是光在作祟，她让明日香的思绪变得混乱。

'Why does she say such stupid things to me? He also cooks for Misato. He's just a stupid little boy with a cute smile.'  
'她为何对我说这些无稽之谈？他也会为 Misato 下厨。不过是个带着可爱笑容的傻小子罢了。'

She froze She covered her face slightly with her free hand, feeling the blood rush to her face. How could she have thought he had a cute smile? She was too embarrassed to get mad at this moment.  
她愣住了，不由自主地用手轻掩面颊，只觉脸颊发烫。她怎么会觉得他的笑容可爱呢？此刻她尴尬至极，连生气都顾不上了。

She finished her food, trying not to think about stupid Shinji.  
她吃完了饭，尽量不去想那个蠢蠢的慎二。

"Thanks for the food. You're not so useless after all." She got up and beelined for her room.  
"谢谢你的食物，看来你还是有点用处的。"她起身径直走向自己的房间。

"Umm, thanks?" He wasn't sure if that was praise or not.  
"呃，谢谢？" 他拿不准这是否算作夸奖。

---

As Asuka closed the door behind her, she took a deep breath. A cute smile? How did such a thought even enter her mind? She had seen him smile maybe two or three times. Another thought came to her mind. Why does she remember how many times he smiled?  
明日香关上身后门的那一刻，她深深吸了一口气。一个可爱的微笑？这种念头是怎么冒出来的？她记得他笑的次数，大概也就两三次。另一个念头又涌上心头。她为何会记得他笑的次数呢？

'Stupid Hikari.' '愚蠢的光。'

She shook her head as if to get the thoughts out of her head. She glanced at the computer on her desk and thought the game would occupy her thoughts.  
她摇摇头，似乎想把杂念甩出脑海。目光落在桌上的电脑上，她觉得玩会儿游戏或许能转移注意力。

Another quest and new tasks to complete. At one point, she reached a challenge that was blocking her. She ended up with a boss who was way above her level. She fought him several times and lost each of them.  
新的任务和挑战接踵而至。某次，她碰到了一个难题，挡住了她的去路。她不得不面对一个等级远高于她的 Boss，尽管多次尝试，却屡战屡败。

'What the hell? I'm gonna show him who's boss!'  
'到底怎么回事？我要让他明白谁说了算！'

A few more fights followed, but she still couldn't beat him. She was getting more and more irritated. As she waited for her character to regenerate, she noticed a player who was different in level from the rest. He had many more levels than she did. This place was no match for him. She glanced at his nickname. LoneWolf. She smiled under her breath.  
随后的几场战斗中，她依旧未能战胜他，心中愈发烦躁。在等待角色恢复之际，她留意到一个与众不同的玩家，其等级远超其他人。这个地方对他而言显然不在话下。她瞥了一眼他的昵称——孤狼，不禁暗自微笑。

"_Why are you here? You have a much higher level than others._" Intrigued, she wrote in the chat.  
"你为何在此？你的水平远超他人。"她好奇地敲下了这些字。

"_Collecting_ _ores__."_ 正在采集矿石。

"_Ores?"_ 矿石吗？

The newly met player explained to her that he was collecting some rare minerals. Although the chances of finding them in the cave they were in were slim, it gave him more. This was because higher level players were looking for them in standard places and it was getting crowded. Here, in the beginner area, he had no competition. He also clarified some points about item creation. The topic interested Asuka because she wanted to have the most powerful items possible.  
新结识的玩家向她透露，他正在搜集一些珍稀矿石。尽管在他们所处的洞穴中寻得这些矿石的可能性微乎其微，但这里却为他提供了更多机会。原因在于，高级玩家们通常在常规地点搜寻，那儿已人满为患。而在此新手区，他并无对手。此外，他还详细解释了关于物品制作的几个关键点。这话题激起了飞鸟的兴趣，因为她渴望拥有最强大的装备。

"_And that sword from the intro? Is it possible to get it?"_  
那把开场时出现的剑，能拿到吗？

"_The burning one? Yes, you can. It's called Deathbringer. One of the best. Maybe not the most powerful, but in a set with a shield it's super good."_  
那把燃烧的剑？没错，就是它。名为死亡使者，堪称上乘之作。虽非威力最强，但若与盾牌配合，效果极佳。

In Asuka's mind, she saw herself wielding that sword and defeating every enemy that stood in her way. She had to have it. She wanted to know more so she asked for some details.  
在明日香的脑海里，她想象着自己挥动那把剑，战胜了所有阻碍她的敌人。她渴望得到它。为了了解更多，她便询问了详情。

"_There is a monster, Mister Edwin. He has a modicum chance of dropping a magic shard. You have to collect ten of them to be able to create the Deathbringer."_  
埃德温先生，这里有个怪物，它掉落魔法碎片的几率很小。您得集齐十片这样的碎片，才能打造出死亡使者。

Asuka wrote down on a piece of paper the information she had gathered, but just as she was about to ask, she got an answer to an unspoken question.  
明日香将收集的信息记录在一张纸上，正要发问之际，一个未曾言明的问题却意外得到了解答。

"_Y__our level is too low to even try. It also takes tactics to do this._ _He_ _has very complicated attacks and timing__s__. The current boss is also too strong for you._ _Want me to_ _help?_"  
你等级太低，连尝试的资格都没有。对付他需要策略，他的攻击和时机都很复杂。现在的 Boss 对你来说太强了。需要我帮忙吗？

'Damn, how did he know?' Asuka was surprised at how easily the stranger recognized her intentions.  
'真是的，他怎么察觉到的？' Asuka 对这位陌生人轻易看穿她的意图感到诧异。

She agreed to help as the current opponent was driving her crazy. Defeating him with help was no challenge at all. In fact, she didn't even have time to run to her opponent before LoneWolf defeated him. The information he gave her seemed valuable. She wondered if she would see him again.  
她答应帮忙，因为眼前的对手让她难以忍受。在协助下打败他毫无难度。实际上，她还没来得及接近对手，LoneWolf 就已将其击败。他提供的信息颇具价值。她心中暗想，不知是否还有机会再见到他。

"_Could I ask you about other information in the future?"_  
将来我还能向您咨询其他信息吗？

"_Sure, just add me as friend."_  
好的，把我加为好友吧。

She did as he suggested. A moment later he walked away. She gathered the information she had obtained and went on her journey.  
她依他的建议行事。不久，他便离开了。她整理了收集到的信息，继续踏上旅程。

**Saturday 周六**

Saturdays were the days when Shinji cleaned the apartment. The only thing he didn't clean was Asuka's room. Her room was a no-go zone. She told him that she would clean her room herself, calling him a pervert when he asked if he could clean her room.  
周六是真嗣打扫公寓的日子，唯独明日香的房间除外。她的房间是他的禁区。她曾明确表示会自己打扫，还警告他，若他提出帮忙打扫，她会视他为变态。

The day began as usual. Asuka came out of her room for breakfast and found only Shinji. This situation was no surprise to her. She knew that Misato had come because she had seen her shoes, but she had not yet left her bedroom. It seemed obvious to Asuka that Misato had returned late and was still asleep. This time Asuka didn't even bother. She knew that Kaji's eyes were solely on Misato. It irritated her every time.  
日子一如往常地开始。明日香走出房间准备吃早餐，只看见了真嗣。这种情况她并不感到意外。她知道美里已经来了，因为她看到了美里的鞋子，但美里还没从卧室出来。很明显，美里昨晚回来得晚，现在还在睡。这次明日香连理都懒得理。她清楚加持的眼里只有美里，每次想到这都让她心烦。

After breakfast, Asuka went back to her room and Shinji took care of the cleaning. She turned on her computer to play for a while. Later she will decide what to do today.  
早餐过后，明日香回到自己房间，真嗣则负责清洁工作。她启动电脑，稍作娱乐。待会儿她会决定今天的计划。

The tips she got yesterday helped her a lot. She managed to get several levels up in a fairly short time. After playing for a short time, she heard a knock on the door.  
昨天她得到的那些建议确实帮了大忙，让她在短时间内连升数级。刚玩了一会儿，就听到有人敲门。

"I'm going out. When Misato gets up, tell her the food is in the fridge."  
我出门了。Misato 起床后，告诉她食物放在冰箱里。

It was Shinji's voice. He finished cleaning up pretty quickly, which was to be expected. He kept the apartment in general order except for Misato's room. That one he cleaned on Saturdays, but she was still asleep.  
那是真嗣的声音。他打扫得很快，这很正常。他通常保持公寓整洁，唯独美里的房间例外。他会在周六打扫她的房间，但那时她还在睡梦中。

"Okay." 好的。

She did a few more quests and got stuck. The items that carried her character were already too weak. After a moment's thought, she checked her friends list and saw that LoneWolf was online. A brief exchange of words and she already knew what to do next.  
她继续做了几个任务，结果卡住了。原来，支撑她角色的装备已经力不从心。她稍作思索，便查看了好友列表，看到孤狼正好在线。经过一番简短沟通，她立刻明白了接下来的行动方向。

When she heard Misato leave the room, she decided to stop playing. It seemed to her that she had spent only a moment playing, but it was already approaching noon.  
听到碇真嗣离开房间的声音，她决定结束游戏。感觉上只玩了片刻，却已快到中午时分。

'It's such a time eater.'  
这真是耗费时间。

She decided to go for a walk. Normally she would have walked to the mall with Hikari, but she was busy. So she went alone.  
她决定去散散步。平时她会和光一起去逛商场，但那天光有事。于是她便独自一人去了。

---

At dusk, Asuka usually watched television. This time she changed her routine. There was usually nothing interesting to watch on TV anyway so she went to her room to play.  
傍晚时分，明日香一般会看电视。但这次她打破了常规。毕竟电视节目往往乏味，她便回房自娱自乐去了。

A short gameplay before she messaged LoneWolf asking if he would help her get some items and defeat one boss. He agreed and wrote back that he would join her in a moment. They played for a while exchanging messages.  
在给 LoneWolf 发消息询问是否愿意帮忙获取物品并击败 Boss 之前，她先体验了一段简短的游戏。LoneWolf 答应了，并回复说即刻加入。两人随后一起游戏，期间不断交流信息。

"_Did you have to play for a long time to get that level?_" Asuka was curious how long it would take her. She wondered if, when the free version ended, she would decide to buy the game.  
"要玩很久才能达到那个级别吗？" Asuka 对此感到好奇，想知道这得花多长时间。她还在考虑，免费体验结束后，自己是否会决定购买这款游戏。

"_About three_ _months, but don't let that fool you. I don't play much._"  
虽然接触了大约三个月，但别误会，我其实玩得不多。

'_He's_ _online every time I start_ _this_ _game.'_ She laughed to herself. _"Can you help me defeat Mister Edwin?"_  
'每次我一启动这个游戏，他就在线。'她心中暗笑，"你能帮我战胜埃德温先生吗？"

"_He's hard to beat, and you're too weak to help."_  
他难以战胜，而你力量不足，难以相助。

What kind of answer is that? He should feel honored to be playing with her. Those were Asuka's first thoughts, but then she realized that he didn't know her after all. She wrote back provocatively.  
那样的回答算什么？他本该感到荣幸能与她同台竞技。这是明日香起初的想法，但转念一想，他其实并不了解她。于是，她挑衅地回了消息。

"_Be a man, put your pants on!"_  
像个男子汉，把裤子穿上！

"_Haha, you remind me of someone."_  
哈哈，你让我想起了某个人。

She was intrigued by his answer. Writing to him was pleasant. It seemed as if they had known each other for a long time.  
她对他的回答颇感兴趣。与他通信令人愉悦，仿佛他们已是旧识。

"_Your girlfriend?"_ 你的女朋友吗？

"_No, I don't have a girlfriend. There's a girl from abroad in my class who I have a crush on. Let's just say she's not fond of me and she makes that very clear."_  
不，我没有女朋友。班上有个外国来的女生，我挺喜欢她的。不过，她对我似乎没什么好感，而且她对此毫不掩饰。

She was slightly surprised. She hadn't considered how old LoneWolf might be before, but now she knew he was a student just like her.  
她有些意外。之前没想过孤狼的年纪，现在才知道他也是学生，与她同龄。

"_I'm the one with a similar story. There's this guy I like, but he ignores me. A lot of guys at school want to go out with me, but it's not the same."_  
我也有类似的故事。我喜欢一个男生，可他对我视而不见。学校里不少男生想和我交往，但感觉就是不同。

"_A lot of girls wanted to go out with me too._"  
也有不少女孩子想和我约会。

'Is he just bragging?' She thought he was probably making up some story.  
'她心想：“他是不是在吹牛？”她怀疑他可能在编故事。'

"_Are you that handsome?"_ She wrote smiling, wanting to mock a little.  
"你真的那么帅吗？"她笑着写道，带着一丝调侃的意味。

"_Famous father. I prefer not to talk about it._"  
父亲很有名。我更倾向于不谈及此事。

'Famous? Probably some actor or politician.' A moment's thought. It doesn't hurt to ask.  
'出名？估计是哪个演员或政治人物吧。' 稍作思考。问一问也无伤大雅。

"_How old are you?"_ 您多大年纪了？

"_14. You?"_ 14 号。你呢？

"_Almost 14."_ 快满 14 岁了。

**Monday, School 周一，学校**

The long awaited moment came, the lunch break. Asuka was looking forward to it. She thought the class was boring, and she was able to talk to her only friend during the break.  
期盼已久的午餐休息终于来临，Asuka 满心期待。她觉得课堂枯燥无味，只有在这短暂的休息时间，她才能与唯一的好友畅谈。

"How was your weekend Asuka?"  
飞鸟，你周末过得如何？

"Not bad, we didn't have any training and I met a nice guy."  
挺好的，我们没参加任何培训，我还碰到了一个不错的人。

Hikari almost dropped her food from the sensation.  
光差点因为这感觉把手里的食物掉落。

"You've met some boy? Who is he? Is he cute?"  
你遇到哪个男孩了？他是谁呀？长得帅吗？

Asuka forgot that she hadn't told Hikari that she was playing a game and had met this boy online. She explained how she met him and what she knew about him, which was not much.  
明日香忘了自己尚未告知光，她在玩游戏时在网上结识了这个男孩。她说明了相遇的经过，以及她对这男孩所知甚少的情况。

"He could lie about his age," Hikari said.  
"他可以说谎关于他的年龄，"光说道。

"What do I care if it's online? Besides, I'm comfortable writing with him and that's it. Tell me, are we going somewhere after school today? I have another sync test tomorrow and I won't be able to."  
我在乎它是否在线干嘛？关键是，我和他合作写作感觉很好，这就够了。对了，我们放学后有什么安排吗？我明天还有个同步测试，恐怕没法参加其他活动。

"Yes, today it is."  
没错，今天正是。

---

**Next week, Misato's apartment  
下周，米莎托的公寓**

'Finally, my room.' 终于，我的房间。

Asuka threw herself onto the bed. She laid down on her stomach because her back hurt. The past week was tedious. They had more sync training than usual, and an angel to go with it. Said angel was the cause of her back pain.  
明日香一头倒在床上，因为背痛，她选择趴着。过去的一周异常枯燥，他们进行了超乎寻常的同步训练，还遭遇了一个使徒，正是这个使徒让她背痛不已。

When she remembered it, a slight shiver ran through her. The angel looked like a giant spider. As much as she is not afraid of spiders, her encounter with the angel was a little scary. Namely, she opened the hatch and saw it very clearly. It was so close and she was not in Unit-02.  
每当她回想起那一刻，总会感到一阵轻微的颤栗。那天使的模样酷似一只庞大的蜘蛛。虽然她对蜘蛛并无畏惧，但与天使的邂逅确实让她心生寒意。当时，她打开舱门，那景象清晰地映入眼帘。它近在咫尺，而她却不在二号机内。

She wanted to relax after that rough encounter. She sat down at her desk and started the game. LoneWolf was online, great. She had someone to talk to. Of course, she didn't tell him she was a pilot. It suited her to be able to talk to him so openly. Other guys only look at her because of her beauty and the fact that she is a pilot.  
经历了一场艰难的遭遇后，她渴望放松。于是，她坐到桌前，启动了游戏。LoneWolf 正好在线，真是太好了。她找到了可以聊天的人。当然，她并未透露自己是飞行员的身份。能如此坦诚地与他交流，正合她心意。其他男生往往只因她的美貌和飞行员身份而对她另眼相看。

"_Hi, I had a rough day. How have you been?_"  
你好，今天我过得很不顺。你最近怎么样？

"_Good. They just turned on the electricity in town."_  
好的。镇上的电力刚刚开通了。

Then it hit her. There was a power outage in the city during the attack. Could it be that he lived in Tokyo just like her? That would be an amazing coincidence.  
她突然意识到，袭击时城市恰逢停电。难道他也住在东京，和她一样？这真是太巧了。

"_Do you live in Tokyo?"_  
您住在东京吗？

For a long moment she got no answer. She wondered why. Just as she was about to send a message, she got a reply.  
她等了好一会儿，却迟迟没有回音。她不禁纳闷。就在她打算再次发信询问时，终于收到了回复。

"_Yes, how do you know?"_  
对，你怎么知道的呢？

"_Lucky guess. I also live in Tokyo. There was an angel attack and no electricity because of it._"  
真是巧了。我也在东京。刚才发生了天使袭击，导致停电了。

"_I see. Would you like to do some quests?"_  
明白了。要不要接几个任务做做？

It was exactly what she needed. A few quests would relax her. It was what she did. Unfortunately she didn't have time to do more, although she would have liked to. She had school, which she thought was pointless, but after many conversations with Misato she knew there was no point in arguing.  
这恰是她所需的。完成几个任务能让她放松。这是她的习惯。遗憾的是，她抽不出更多时间，尽管她很愿意。她还得上学，尽管她觉得那毫无意义，但与 Misato 多次沟通后，她明白争论也是徒劳。

Finally, she came up with an idea that she wasn't entirely sure about. She thought about whether to meet the LoneWolf.  
最后，她脑海中浮现出一个自己也不甚确定的想法。她思索着是否该去见那位独行侠。

"_Hey, what would you say to a meeting? But one in real life, not in a game?"_  
嘿，要不要考虑开个现实中的会议？不是游戏里的那种。

"_I don't know. I don't play this game with anyone I know, and I'd rather keep it that way."_  
我不清楚。我从不与熟人玩这个游戏，更希望维持现状。

'What does he mean? Is he afraid of something?' She didn't want to let him go. Even if he was a typical nerd, she wanted to get to meet him. Hikari's worries were probably unfounded. If he was pretending to be a kid he would want to meet her rather than avoid contact.  
'他到底是什么意思？他是不是有所畏惧？'她并不想让他走。即便他是个典型的书呆子，她还是渴望能与他相识。光的担忧或许并无根据。如果他真的在装作孩子，那他应该更愿意接近她，而非躲避。

"_I don't bite. It's a casual meeting, not a date. We'll have a cup of tea, talk. That's all."_  
别担心，我不会咬人。这只是一次轻松的聚会，不是约会。我们喝杯茶，随便聊聊，就这样。

"_Okay, although I'm not convinced. I can meet on Thursday after 4pm."_  
行吧，虽然我还没完全信服。我可以在周四下午四点之后见面。

Thursday suited her. She's pretty busy until Thursday. Mostly because of meetings at the base due to the previous attack.  
星期四对她来说正合适。她一直忙到周四，主要是因为之前基地遭受袭击，导致会议频繁。

"_Then I'll see you on Thursday. I'll write down where."_  
那我们周四见。我会把地点记下来。

She finished the game and lay down. She wasn't sure what to expect. Who could this LoneWolf be? Would she be as comfortable talking to him in person as she is in the game? Well, she would soon find out. She was betting he was some kind of nerd.  
她结束了游戏，躺下休息。心中充满疑惑，这位 LoneWolf 究竟是何方神圣？现实中与他交谈，能否如游戏里那般自如？答案即将揭晓。她猜测对方可能是个技术宅。

---

**School 学校**

"What do you mean, you asked him out?"  
你说什么？你主动约他出去了？

Hikari found it hard to believe such a bold move by Asuka. On the other hand, she was a little envious. She would like to be so bold too, though she would hate to admit it.  
光难以置信飞鸟竟有如此大胆之举。同时，她心中也隐隐羡慕。她渴望自己也能这般果敢，只是不愿明言罢了。

"Just a casual get-together to talk, nothing special."  
就是一次轻松的聚会，大家随便聊聊，没什么特别的。

'Nothing special?' Hikari envied her boldness. She wished she could be so bold with Toji.  
'真的没什么特别的吗？'光对她的勇敢感到羡慕。她希望自己也能对时生展现出这样的勇气。

"When do you want to meet him?"  
你想什么时候见他？

"On Thursday. Why do you ask?"  
星期四。你为什么这么问？

Hikari took out her notebook and started leafing through the pages. Finally, she found page that interested her.  
光拿出笔记本，翻阅着页面。终于，她找到了令她感兴趣的那一页。

"Okay, you and Shinji have cleaning duty on Thursday, but it just so happened that Miku wanted to switch and finish earlier on Friday."  
好的，你和真嗣原本安排在周四做清洁，但恰好美玖想换到周五，希望能早点完成。

"Uh?" Asuka had completely forgotten about her cleaning duty. She did not worry about such things and usually found out the day before or even the same day. "I forgot. Switch us if you can."  
哎呀？" 明日香彻底忘了还有清洁任务这回事。她向来不把这些放在心上，往往是前一天甚至当天才想起来。"我给忘了。能帮我们调换一下吗？

"Sure thing." 没问题。

There was a moment of silence. Hikari wondered if Asuka was doing the right thing by wanting to meet a boy she didn't know at all. This uncertainty begged the question, albeit asked without certainty. "What if he lied how old he was?"  
沉默片刻后，光思索着，明日香坚持要见一个素未谋面的男孩，这决定是否正确？这份疑虑不禁让人提出疑问，虽然问得并不坚定。“如果他谎称了自己的年龄呢？”

"So? I can handle myself, you worry too much."  
怎么了？我能照顾好自己，你过于操心了。

Seeing the look on her friend's face, Asuka wondered why Hikari was so twiggy. It was fine, and she didn't need to worry about her. "What?"  
看到朋友脸上的表情，明日香不禁疑惑，光为何如此瘦削。其实这没什么，她无需为她担忧。“怎么了？”

Hikari took a defensive position. She did not want to offend her friend because she knew very well how she would react.  
光采取了防御姿态。她不愿得罪朋友，深知对方的反应会如何。

"Nothing, nothing. I know you can handle it. Please just text me when you meet him."  
没事，我相信你能搞定。见到他后，记得给我发个消息。

Asuka was already about to protest when it occurred to her what had happened. She couldn't remember when someone had been worried about her. It was a nice feeling. Of course, she didn't want to admit it. To admit it would be tantamount to showing weakness.  
阿苏卡正要抗议，却猛然想起所发生的事。她已记不得上次有人为她担忧是何时，这感觉真好。然而，她并不愿承认，因为承认无异于示弱。

"Fine, I will." As they were about to return to class, Asuka added "Thanks."  
行，我会的。" 就在他们准备回教室时，Asuka 又加了一句："谢谢。

---

**Thursday 周四**

After classes at the school, Asuka went to Misato's apartment to change. She didn't have to clean the school today so she had time to change and get ready for the meeting.  
放学后，明日香来到美里的公寓换衣服。由于今天不用打扫学校，她有充足的时间换装并准备参加会议。

Standing in front of her closet, she wondered what to wear. She had two outfits she was considering. The yellow dress she came to Japan in and the green dress. She liked the yellow one, but agreed with LoneWolf that he would recognize her by the green dress. Besides, it wasn't supposed to be a date.  
站在衣橱前，她犹豫不决，不知该穿哪件。她有两套衣服可选：来日本时穿的黄色连衣裙和绿色连衣裙。虽然她偏爱黄色那件，但考虑到 LoneWolf 会通过绿色连衣裙认出她，便同意了他的建议。毕竟，这并非正式的约会。

The place she chose to meet was not too far away. It was a small café that she had been to several times with Hikari. Asuka settled on waiting next to the tree for the boy. That was how he was going to recognize her. The tree and the green dress.  
她挑选的会面地点并不遥远，是一家她曾与光多次光顾的小咖啡馆。明日香决定在树旁等候那位男孩，他正是凭此来辨识她——树与那袭绿裙。

She looked at her watch. It was a few minutes past the appointed meeting time. She was impatient, she didn't like waiting. Besides, the boys should be the ones waiting for her, not the other way around.  
她瞥了一眼手表，已经比约定的时间晚了好几分钟。她开始不耐烦，不喜欢这种等待。毕竟，按理说应该是那些男生等她，而不是她等他们。

Annoyed, she began to look around. The neighborhood was not very busy. Then she saw something that made her freeze. She recognized a figure walking in the distance. It was Aida.  
她心烦意乱地环顾四周，发现这个街区并不热闹。突然，她看到一个令她愣住的场景。远处走来的人影，她一眼就认出是艾达。

'Damn, not him!' '哎呀，怎么是他！'

She was nervous, but in her mind everything started to make sense. He was a computer geek. Just of all people, why him? She wondered if he saw her, if she still had time to escape. Then she saw the boy turn around and greet someone. They exchanged a few words and moved away together in another direction. She sighed in relief, it wasn't him.  
她感到紧张，但内心逐渐明朗起来。他是个电脑迷。偏偏是他，为什么是他？她想知道他是否注意到了她，她是否还有机会逃离。随后，她看到那个男孩转身向某人打招呼。他们简短交谈后，一同朝另一方向离去。她如释重负，那人并非他。

"Asuka?" 飞鸟？

Asuka heard a familiar voice coming from behind her. Turning around, she saw Shinji. She was surprised to see him. This café was not on the way to the apartment.  
明日香听到背后传来熟悉的声音，转身一看，原来是真嗣。她颇感意外，因为这家咖啡馆并不顺路去公寓。

"I'm waiting for someone, go away."  
我在等人，请回避一下。

She waved her hand, letting him know to leave. But he didn't respond, just looked at her. Before she could react, he asked a question with a puzzled look on his face.  
她挥手示意他离开，他却无动于衷，只是凝视着她。未等她有所反应，他便面带疑惑地提出了一个问题。

"Are you RedQueen?" 您是 RedQueen 吗？

"What?! Don't tell me, you're LoneWolf?"  
什么？！难道你就是传说中的孤狼？

When he nodded, she was overwhelmed with anger and disbelief. She couldn't believe that Shinji was LoneWolf. The stupid little boy who apologizes for everything? Is he the one she was so comfortable writing with? It couldn't be true. She was sure he'd found out she was playing and wanted to make fun of her.  
他一点头，她便怒火中烧，难以置信。真嗣竟是孤狼？那个动不动就道歉的小子？她怎能相信，那个让她畅所欲言的人竟是他？这绝非事实。她断定他已识破她的游戏，故意来嘲弄她。

"You bastard! I can't believe I let myself fall for that." Offended, with a quick step she wanted to walk away.  
"你这个混蛋！我真没想到自己会中招。"她感到被冒犯，急忙加快脚步想要离开。

"Asuka, wait!" Asuka，等一下！

He wanted to stop her, but she pushed his hand away. Standing motionless, he watched the girl move away. He didn't know what had just happened.  
他本想拦住她，她却推开了他的手。他呆立原地，目送女孩渐行渐远，心中一片茫然，不知所措。

---

**Misato's apartment 美里小姐的公寓**

Shinji entered the apartment and found silence. Asuka was back, he could see her shoes. He walked to the door of her room and paused for a moment. There was a blank in his mind. He didn't know what to say, but he felt he had to do something. He gathered up his courage and knocked.  
真嗣踏入公寓，四周静悄悄的。明日香的鞋子表明她已经回来。他缓步至她的房门前，驻足片刻。脑海中一片茫然，他不知如何开口，却深感必须有所行动。于是，他鼓足勇气，轻敲了房门。

"Go away." 请离开。

"I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you, really. Please, let's talk."  
对不起，我之前不知道是你。我们谈谈好吗？

He stood for a moment hoping for an answer, but got none. Disappointed, he went to the kitchen and began preparing dinner. He was angry with himself for agreeing to the meeting. He was comfortable writing with her, and now she was angry with him.  
他站立片刻，盼着能得到回应，却落了空。带着失望，他走进厨房着手准备晚餐。他对自己答应参加那次会议感到懊恼。原本与她合作写作让他感到自在，如今她却对他心生怒气。

Shinji felt a poke. Looking down he saw a PenPen standing next to him. He pulled a fish out of the refrigerator and put it on a plate for the penguin.  
真嗣感觉到有人轻轻戳了他一下。他低头一看，发现一只企鹅正站在他身旁。于是，他从冰箱里取出一条鱼，放在盘子上递给了企鹅。

"Here, I'll give someone a good day today."  
今天，我会让某人过得非常愉快。

"Wark?" 打仗？

He just smiled and went back to cooking. As he prepared the meal, he thought about how to ease the situation he was in. The smell of dinner wafted through the apartment. Before he could put the dish on the plate, he heard the door opening. Asuka came out of her room and headed for the kitchen. That made him happy, he didn't have to call her in for dinner. He guessed she would have ignored him then.  
他只是微微一笑，继续烹饪。一边准备晚餐，一边思索着如何缓和自己所处的困境。饭菜的香气在公寓中飘散。他还没来得及将菜肴摆盘，就听到门开了。明日香从房间走出，径直走向厨房。这让他心生欢喜，无需再唤她共进晚餐。他猜想，若那时呼唤，她或许会置若罔闻。

She sat down at the table and he handed her a plate. They ate in silence. That silence made him uneasy. He wanted to start a conversation, yet he decided he would wait until she had finished eating. He did not make it, she was the first to speak.  
她坐到桌旁，他递给她一个盘子。两人默默用餐。这份沉默令他心神不宁。他本想开启对话，却决定等她吃完再说。然而，他没能忍住，是她先打破了沉默。

"Which one of you idiots came up with this?"  
你们当中是哪个笨蛋想出这个主意的？

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

She rolled her eyes. The boy actually gave the impression that he didn't understand.  
她翻了翻白眼，那男孩似乎真的没明白。

"Don't play dumb with me! The game. Did you guys take turns playing to make fun of me?"  
别跟我装糊涂！那个游戏，你们是不是轮流玩来嘲笑我？

"No! Neither Toji nor Kensuke play this game, I play alone."  
不！东治和健介都不玩这个游戏，我独自玩。

Shinji didn't quite understand why she thought he wanted to make fun of her. It's just a game. Besides, she was the one who wanted to meet, not him.  
真嗣不太理解她为何觉得他想取笑她，毕竟这只是个游戏。再说，是她说要见面的，并非他主动。

"Liar. Why are you online even when you're cleaning or when you're not home, huh?"  
骗子。为何你明明在做清洁或不在家，却还显示在线呢？

At first he didn't understand what she meant, but then it came to him. He grabbed his phone from the table and started looking through it. Asuka didn't really know why he needed the phone. After a while, he showed it to her.  
起初他没领会她的意图，但随后恍然大悟。他迅速从桌上拿起手机翻看起来。明日香并不明白他为何要查看手机。片刻后，他将手机屏幕转向她展示。

"What?" 什么？

"Phone app. You can chat with people from the game."  
手机应用，让你能与游戏中的其他玩家进行聊天。

She grabbed his phone and started looking at it. He had their last conversation on screen. She started going through the previous messages and everything matched. Turns out he wasn't lying and it wasn't a stupid joke. She handed the phone back to him and started looking at him.  
她拿起他的手机，开始翻看。屏幕上正显示着他们上次的对话。她逐一查看之前的短信，发现内容完全吻合。看来他并未说谎，这也不是什么无聊的玩笑。她将手机递还给他，目光转向了他。

"This is no stupid joke, is it?"  
这可不是什么愚蠢的玩笑，对吧？

"No, I swear." His statement sounded sincere.  
"不，我保证。"他的话听起来十分诚恳。

"How is it possible to have such a good conversation with you in the game? Normally, you're not even half that interesting."  
游戏中与你交谈竟如此愉快，真是难得，平时你可没这么有趣。

"Normally, we don't talk much. Besides, it's easier in the game. You only see the virtual character."  
平时我们交谈甚少。况且，在游戏里沟通更为简便，你面对的只是虚拟形象。

Again there was an awkward silence. What he says makes sense. They don't talk much. Plus, she wasn't usually interested in what he had to say. She remembered what he had written to her in the game and felt the blood rush to her face.  
又一次尴尬的沉默降临。他的话确实有道理。他们之间的交流并不多。况且，她通常对他所说的话并不感兴趣。她回想起他在游戏里写给她的文字，顿时感到脸颊发烫。

"Pervert." 下流。

"Huh?" 嗯？

"You said you have a crush on a girl from abroad, and there is only one at school."  
你提到你对外校的一个女孩产生了好感，学校里仅此一位。

He turned red and looked away, unable to look at her at the moment. He had revealed his secret. That was all he needed. Now she would probably make fun of him. He was not wrong, teasing time was going to come very soon.  
他脸颊泛红，目光移向别处，此刻无法直视她。秘密已不慎泄露，这已足够。她或许会因此取笑他，他的预感没错，嘲讽的时刻即将来临。

"Um, you see, I-" 嗯，你看，我...

"I don't believe it. I bet you're peeping at me."  
我真不敢相信，你肯定在偷看我。

"No, I swear! I never lied to you or peeped at you."  
真的，我发誓！我从未对你撒过谎，也没有偷看过你。

The boy seemed nervous. It reminded her of the situation on the ship. She knew he hadn't seen her then, but that wasn't important right now. She liked his embarrassment.  
男孩显得有些紧张，这让她回想起船上的那一幕。她清楚他那时并未注意到她，不过此刻这已无关紧要。她倒是对他的窘态颇有好感。

'That cute look on his face'  
'他脸上那可爱的表情'

She shook her head as if to put those thoughts out of her head. He was just a stupid little boy. That's right. It was time to punish him. For making a fool of herself.  
她摇摇头，似乎想把那些念头甩出脑海。他只是个愚蠢的小男孩罢了。没错，该给他点教训了。谁让他让自己出丑。

"What about on the ship?"  
船上情况如何？

"I didn't know you were changing. I didn't see anything."  
我没注意到你在换衣服，什么也没看到。

"Yeah, right. I bet you're looking through my dirty underwear. Pervert."  
得了吧，你肯定在翻我的脏内衣。真是个变态。

Her eyes widened. She didn't expect what would happen. It was supposed to be a joke. Instead of defending himself, Shinji fell silent. He lowered his head and looked guilty.  
她瞪大了眼睛，没想到会有这样的发展。原本只是个玩笑。真嗣并未辩解，反而沉默下来，低着头，一副内疚的样子。

"It was supposed to be a joke, and you, you actually do it?"  
原本只是开个玩笑，没想到你真的去做了？

"But I do the laundry here. I have to separate the colors. I'm not doing anything perverted, I…"  
但在这里我负责洗衣服，得把颜色分类。我并没有做任何不妥的事，我……

He gave up. He didn't know how to convince her. All that remained was to wait for her verdict. Surely, it would not be good for him. But she didn't say anything. She sat across from him, silent.  
他放弃了，不知道怎样才能说服她。现在只能等待她的判决，显然这不会对他有利。然而，她一言不发，只是静静地坐在他对面。

Then they heard the apartment door open. Misato came home. A brief moment and she joined them in the kitchen.  
接着，他们听到公寓门开启的声音，是碇真嗣回来了。不一会儿，她就走进厨房和他们汇合了。

"Hi, how was your day? Shinji, it smells good."  
你好，今天过得如何？真嗣，味道很香呢。

"I'm done eating." Asuka got up from the table and went to her room.  
"我吃完了。" 明日香起身离开餐桌，回到自己的房间。

"Did something happen? Did you two had a fight again?"  
出什么事了吗？你们俩是不是又吵架了？

"No, nothing happened." 没有，什么事都没发生。

---

After finishing the dishes, Shinji went to his room. Before he had time to get in, he heard the door open behind him. Asuka emerged from her room and leaned her back against the door frame. She focused her gaze on him which troubled him slightly.  
洗完碗，真嗣正要回房，却听见身后门响。明日香从自己房间走出，背倚门框，目光紧锁在他身上，令他略感局促。

"Where's Misato?" 米萨托在哪儿？

"In her room with PenPen. They're probably drinking."  
她和 PenPen 在房间里，估计正在喝酒。

He wanted to say something else, but he didn't know what. She kept looking at him as if she was analyzing him. After a while she crossed her arms and her face became more serious.  
他本想再说些什么，却不知从何说起。她始终凝视着他，似乎在细细剖析。片刻后，她双臂交叉，神情愈发严肃。

"So you have a crush on me?" He wanted to look away, but she wouldn't let him. "Look at me and say it to my face!"  
所以你对我动心了？"他本想避开目光，她却不依不饶。"直视我，当面告诉我！

He looked at her slightly startled by her voice. Asuka didn't yell at him, but her voice was different than usual. Shinji didn't know what it meant, but something told him that he didn't want to know and that he had to obey her.  
他略显惊讶地望向她，她的声音出乎意料。明日香并未对他高声斥责，然而她的语调与平日迥异。真嗣不明所以，但心底有个声音告诉他，他不愿深究，只能遵从她的意思。

"I-"

He found it hard to form words when he looked at her. He hadn't had much of a chance to look at her so closely. She was beautiful, and her eyes were mesmerizing. He saw the slight annoyance on her face so he focused and forced out a confession.  
他望着她，竟一时语塞。鲜少有机会这般近距离凝视，她的美丽与那双摄人心魄的眼眸令他失语。察觉到她脸上的微愠，他定了定神，艰难地吐露了心声。

"I l-like you Asuka. I've had a crush on you for a while now." It worked, he told her. He didn't know why she wanted him to do it, but he was glad he did.  
"我对你倾心已久，明日香。" 他向她坦白，这一招果然有效。虽然不清楚她为何要他这么做，但他庆幸自己照做了。

Asuka pressed her lips together and lowered her hands. She grabbed the slightly ajar door with her hand and began rubbing it. After a moment's thought, she spoke up.  
明日香紧抿双唇，垂下双手，伸手握住半开的门，轻轻摩挲。思索片刻后，她终于开口。

"I've thought it over and decided to give you a chance."  
我经过深思熟虑，决定给你一次机会。

"A chance?" He opened his eyes wide in surprise. Had he just overheard or had she really said that?  
"机会？" 他惊讶地瞪大了眼睛。他是无意中听到的，还是她真的这么说了？

"Yes, a chance. Prove that this isn't a stupid joke and that you can be cool not just in the game. Prove it and maybe I'll let you take me out on a date."  
是的，有机会。证明这不是无聊的玩笑，你不仅在游戏里酷，现实中也能保持酷劲。做到了，或许我会考虑和你出去约会。

What he heard shocked him. She seemed not to be making fun of him. He didn't know how to react to the opportunity he had been given.  
他听到的消息令他震惊不已。她看起来并非在嘲笑他。面对这个突如其来的机遇，他不知该如何是好。

"I, yes, I mean." He took a breath to calm himself. "I'll do anything you want. I wasn't making a joke. Thank you! Than-"  
我，没错，我是认真的。" 他深吸一口气，试图让自己冷静下来。"我会按照你的要求去做。我刚才并非开玩笑。谢谢你！谢-

She silenced him by pressing her index finger against his chest.  
她用食指轻按他的胸口，使他安静下来。

"If you tell someone about it, the deal is off." After seeing him nod. "Good. Now help me get my sword."  
如果你将此事泄露出去，交易立即作废。" 见他点头同意后，"很好。现在帮我取剑。

"Yes Asuka." 好的，明日香。

Asuka turned around and just as she was about to close the door to her room, she spoke.  
明日香转身之际，正要关上房门，她开口说话了。

"I'd almost forgot. Which of my underwear do you like best?"  
差点忘了问你，我哪件内衣最得你心？

He turned red and answered. "The red one." He clapped a hand over his mouth.  
他脸一红，答道：“是红色的那个。”话音刚落，他便用手捂住了自己的嘴。

"Pervert. I knew it!" 果然是个变态。我早就料到了！

She laughed and disappeared behind the door.  
她笑了一声，随即隐没在门后。
