December 2017

The room would have seemed like a morgue, quiet and dark, if it had not been for the equipment in it. Faint green light shone from the displays of the equipment as they kept their quiet vigil. Shallow breathing could be heard from different areas of the room, showing that there was indeed life present. But even the signs of life could do nothing to dispel the impression that Death hovered in that room, waiting for the right time. Yet Death would have to wait as bright light flooded the room from the opening door. Silhouetted for a moment was the figure of a person, a nurse to be more accurate. The glare was cut off as the door closed before she turned on a lamp.

房间本会显得如太平间般静谧幽暗，若非其中的设备。微弱的绿光从设备的显示屏上透出，它们静静守望。房间各处传来轻微的呼吸声，昭示着生命的存在。然而，即便有生命迹象，也难以驱散死亡盘旋于此、伺机而动的印象。但死亡必须等待，因为开门之际，明亮的灯光涌入房间。一瞬间，人影轮廓显现，更确切地说，是一位护士。随着门扉关闭，她未及开灯，那刺目光线便被切断。

Walking over to the bed she stared at the occupant, like she had done every day for the last two years. She always felt her heart sink at the sight of her patient, especially since she had known her before she had been hospitalized. Auburn hair that used to glow with a vitality of its own was now dull and lifeless, cut off slightly above the shoulder. The nurse remembered the argument that had ensued from the girl's guardian and roommate. Reaching down, she brushed some hair off the teen’s face, saddened by the sunken cheeks and the pale complexion. The nurse knew how much her friends wanted to see her blue eyes looking back at them again, but at the moment, they were sealed shut.

她缓步走向床边，凝视着床上的病人，如同过去两年里的每一天。每当看到这位患者，她的心总是不由得一沉，尤其是因为她认识这位女孩在住院之前的样子。曾经充满生机的红褐色秀发，如今却黯淡无光，略高于肩部被剪短。护士回想起女孩的监护人与室友之间的争执。她俯身轻抚开少女脸上的发丝，为那凹陷的双颊和苍白的肤色感到悲伤。护士知道，朋友们多么渴望再次看到那双蓝眼睛回望他们，然而此刻，它们紧闭着。

Sighing, the nurse broke off her observation, to keep from getting further depressed. Moving with a purpose she started to inspect the readings and write down the results. Despite having been bedridden for a long time, her patient was in decent health, the heart monitor showed a strong, steady rhythm and though she was ten pounds under her optimal weight, it wasn't dangerous. The nurse smiled as she saw a teddy bear in the crook of the girl's arm as she recorded her blood pressure and temperature. She made a special note to have the neurologist come in and examine the readings of the EEG. They were highly active and approaching the levels of an awake state. That would be good news for everyone who had waited two years for good news. Taking down a couple more notes, the nurse left a reminder on her chart that the patient needed a bath and her clothes changed.

护士叹了口气，中断观察以免情绪更加低落。她带着明确的目的开始检查读数并记录结果。尽管长期卧床，她的病人健康状况尚可，心电监护显示心律强劲而稳定，虽然体重比最佳状态轻了十磅，但并无危险。记录血压和体温时，护士看到女孩臂弯里的泰迪熊，不禁微笑。她特意记下要请神经科医生来检查脑电图的读数，它们异常活跃，接近清醒状态的水平。这对所有等待了两年好消息的人来说，无疑是喜讯。护士又记下几笔，在病历上留下提醒，病人需要洗澡并更换衣物。

"Asuka."

The nurse started at the unexpected whisper. Looking up from her notes, she spied a figure that had escaped her notice. She should have known he would be there. Curled up in a nearby chair with his knees drawn up, slept a boy the same age as the girl. Walking over to the chair, the nurse knelt down to look at the boy. What had once been a cute face was becoming handsome, the curves becoming lines and the softness turning to hardness. She knew what had caused the hardness and could only pity the child. Like the girl, the boy had gone through so much.

护士被这突如其来的低语吓了一跳。她从笔记中抬起头，发现一个身影逃过了她的注意。她早该知道他会在那里。蜷缩在附近的一把椅子上，膝盖紧贴胸前，睡着一个与女孩同龄的男孩。护士走过去，跪在椅子旁，端详着男孩。曾经可爱的面庞正变得英俊，曲线化作线条，柔软转为坚硬。她知道是什么导致了这种坚硬，只能对这个孩子心生怜悯。和女孩一样，这个男孩也经历了太多。

"Shinji," she whispered as she shook his shoulder. "Shinji, wake up."

真嗣，"她轻声唤道，摇了摇他的肩膀。"真嗣，醒醒。

It took a few more shakes and raising the volume of her voice before the boy awoke.

经过几次摇晃和提高嗓门，男孩才醒过来。

"Akari?" The boy asked groggily, wiping his eyes. "What's the matter?"

明里？" 男孩睡眼惺忪地问道，揉了揉眼睛。"怎么了？

"Nothing, except that you should be at home sleeping." Akari saw him shake his head in the negative.

"没什么，只是你应该在家睡觉。" 明里看到他摇头表示否定。

"I can't do that. She," Shinji trailed off. "It's her birthday. She shouldn't be alone on her birthday; it's not right."

我做不到。她，" 真嗣欲言又止，"今天是她的生日。她不应该在生日那天独自一人；这不合适。

Akari shook her head sadly as she looked at the clock to reaffirm what time it was. She didn't have the heart to tell him it was three in the morning and Asuka had had her birthday the day before. The small gathering had been quiet and subdued with only a few friends showing up for the occasion. Knowing that any suggestions to go home would be ignored the nurse stood up and went to a nearby closet.

阿卡里悲伤地摇了摇头，她看向时钟，再次确认时间。她不忍心告诉他现在是凌晨三点，而明日香昨天已经过了生日。那场小型聚会很安静，气氛压抑，只有几个朋友来参加了。知道任何提议回家的建议都会被忽视，这位护士站起身，走向附近的壁橱。

"Here." She handed him a pillow, while she unfolded the blanket. "I need to finish my rounds."

给。" 她递给他一个枕头，同时展开了毯子。"我需要完成我的巡视。

"Thank you," replied Shinji as he wrapped the blanket around himself. "You've done a lot for us." She saw his face cloud. "Even when others have given up."

谢谢你，" 真嗣回答道，同时用毯子裹住自己。"你为我们做了很多。" 她看到他的脸色变得阴沉。"即使其他人已经放弃了。

"She'll wake up, just wait and see." Akari held up her notes. "I think those new drugs are working."

她会醒来的，等着瞧吧。" 茜举起她的笔记。"我认为那些新药正在起作用。

Shinji could only nod as he looked at the results, not understanding them in the least. The only thing he knew was that Asuka's brain patterns were shifting from a dormant state to something else. As the door closed behind the nurse he stood up to stretch his body, wrapping the blanket around him like a cloak. Ignoring the pain in his joints he walked over to the bed and gazed at Asuka's prone figure. Reaching down he grasped her hand, sorrow filling his being as there was no response to his touch. Giving it a gentle squeeze he placed her hand back on the bed, walked over to his chair and curled up, the pillow forgotten.

真嗣只能点头，望着结果却一头雾水。他唯一知道的是，明日香的脑电波正从休眠状态转变为其他状态。随着护士身后的门关上，他站起来伸展身体，将毯子裹在身上如同披风。他不顾关节的疼痛，走到床边，凝视着明日香躺着的身影。他伸手握住她的手，悲伤涌上心头，因为他的触碰没有得到任何回应。他轻轻地握了握她的手，然后放回床上，走到椅子旁蜷缩起来，枕头已被遗忘。

- - - -

The sound of a harsh, painful cough reached Shinji's consciousness a moment before the alarms went off in the room. His eyes snapped open and he stood up even as his brain comprehended what was going on. The blanket, wound around his legs, sent him to the ground. As his knee hit the floor, Shinji steadied himself and kicked at the blanket in an attempt to be rid of the troublesome object. By the time he was free, the nurses on duty were already at Asuka's side.

一阵剧烈痛苦的咳嗽声传入真嗣的意识，紧接着房间里的警报响起。他的眼睛猛地睁开，站起身来，同时大脑理解了正在发生的事情。裹在腿上的毯子让他摔倒在地。当他的膝盖撞到地板时，真嗣稳住自己，踢开毯子试图摆脱这个麻烦的东西。当他挣脱出来时，值班的护士们已经来到了明日香身边。

"Asuka!" Shinji yelled as he pushed his way to her side. Her heart monitor was going crazy, her mouth open in a noiseless scream.

"阿苏卡！" 真嗣大声喊着，挤到她身边。她的心率监测器疯狂跳动，嘴巴张开，无声地尖叫。

"Get him out of here," a female voice commanded.

"把他带出去，" 一个女性的声音命令道。

A hand grabbed his arm and dragged him to the door, but Shinji struggled, not wanting to leave. Another person was pulling him from outside the room and with their combined strength, they easily removed him. As the door closed and locked, Shinji could only pound his fist against it in anger. His last view of Asuka had been one of a convulsing body and ragged breathing. Turning around, he slid down the door, his arms wrapped around his legs as tears glided down his cheeks. Someone came to stand in front of him, but he ignored that person, not wanting to talk at the moment.

一只手抓住他的胳膊，将他拖向门口，但真嗣挣扎着，不愿离开。另一个人从房间外拉扯他，两人合力轻易地将他拽了出去。随着门关闭并上锁，真嗣只能愤怒地用拳头敲打门板。他最后看到的明日香是身体抽搐、呼吸急促的样子。他转过身，顺着门滑坐下来，双臂紧紧抱住双腿，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。有人走到他面前，但他无视了那个人，此刻不想交谈。

"Shinji," a man spoke. "Shinji, she'll be all right." He kept repeating that until he got a reaction from the boy.

"真嗣，"一个男人说道，"真嗣，她会没事的。"他不断重复这句话，直到男孩有所反应。

Shinji found himself talking, "Everyone keeps saying that to me like it'll make me forget the pain." He looked up, finally recognizing the person. "Damn it Hyuga, I need to see her. I need to be the one to judge whether I can let the pain go, yet."

真嗣发现自己正在说话：“每个人都这样对我说，好像这样就能让我忘记痛苦。”他抬头一看，终于认出了那个人。“该死的日向，我需要见她。我需要亲自判断我是否能放下这痛苦。”

Crouching down, Hyuga stared into Shinji's eyes, "And at the moment you can't do anything for her. Let the doctors do their jobs, okay?" Hyuga extended a hand, "Let's get out of their way and get something to eat."

日向蹲下身来，凝视着真嗣的眼睛，“而现在，你对她无能为力。让医生们做他们的工作，好吗？”日向伸出手，“我们别挡道，去吃点东西吧。”

"No," Shinji said after he had gotten to his feet.

"不，" 真嗣站起来后说道。

"You don't have a choice, Shinji. Misato sent me down here to make sure you ate and went to school." The older man smiled. "Though it looks like you won't be going to school, right?"

你没有选择的余地，真嗣。美里派我来确保你吃饭并去上学。" 年长的男子微笑着说，"不过看来你今天不会去学校了，对吧？

Shinji nodded without smiling as he moved to sit in front of the door again. But Hyuga stopped him after a couple of steps by grabbing his arm. Glancing at the hand on his arm, he started to protest but Hyuga simply gave him a look that said he had no choice but to obey. Giving the door one more glance, as another doctor entered, Shinji lowered his head and walked silently beside Hyuga, hands in his pockets. He didn't even look up as they stepped into the elevator at the end of the hall and traveled the necessary floors to their destination. He tried to ignore the rumbling of his stomach as they entered the cafeteria but found himself next to the tech in line.

真嗣面无表情地点了点头，再次挪动脚步坐到门前。但日向在他走几步后抓住了他的手臂阻止了他。真嗣瞥了一眼抓在自己手臂上的手，正要抗议，日向却用眼神告诉他别无选择只能服从。再次瞥了一眼门，又一位医生走了进来，真嗣低下头，默默地跟在日向身边，双手插在口袋里。他们走进走廊尽头的电梯，前往目的地所需的楼层，真嗣甚至没有抬头。他试图忽略肚子里的咕噜声，但发现自己还是和那位技术人员一起排队进入了食堂。

Hyuga didn't say anything as he filled both his and Shinji's trays with some breakfast food. He had gone through the same thing with Misato in the last two years. At times she would simply draw into her shell, not remembering to eat or sleep as guilt ate at her. The difference was that Shinji and Asuka could start over if they decided to, while Misato had had Kaji taken from her and nothing would change that.

日向没有说话，只是给自己的和真嗣的托盘里装了些早餐食物。过去两年里，他和美里也经历过类似的情况。有时她会完全封闭自己，忘记吃饭和睡觉，因为内疚而备受煎熬。不同的是，如果真嗣和明日香决定重新开始，他们可以做到，而美里失去了加持，这一点无法改变。

"You think," Shinji paused as he poked at his eggs. "You think she'll remember what happened to her? It was bad at the end with that Angel and her attempted," his voice dropped to a whisper. "Suicide."

你想，" 碇真嗣停下戳着鸡蛋的动作，"你想她会记得发生过的事吗？最后和那个使徒以及她试图，" 他的声音低到几乎听不见，"自杀的事。

Hyuga studied the boy for a moment, "Maybe, maybe not. She may try to suppress those memories, which is the wrong thing for her to do. Asuka might also have some mild amnesia, but I'm not a doctor." He sipped from his glass. "The question is, are you going to be there for her?”

日向审视了少年一会儿，"也许会，也许不会。她可能会试图压抑那些记忆，这对她来说是错误的做法。明日香可能也有轻微的失忆，但我不是医生。" 他啜了一口杯子里的东西，"问题是，你会陪在她身边吗？”

"I want to, ...but she told me that she hated me. That she wished I’d never been born, or that she’d never met me."

我想要...但是她告诉我她恨我。她说她希望我从未出生，或者她从未遇见过我。

"Shinji, do you know the difference between a true friend and an associate?"

真嗣，你知道真正的朋友和熟人之间的区别吗？

"No. And there's a difference?" He heard Hyuga sigh at his question.

"不，这有什么区别吗？"他听到 Hyuga 对他的问题叹了口气。

"A true friend stays with that person even through the worst of times. They know that words spoken in anger are rarely ever the truth. Friends are also there to lend an ear or a shoulder to cry on, even when their friends have hurt them. A true friend will keep any secret given to them." Hyuga stopped to see if Shinji understood. "An associate is someone there only during the good times, when there is no need to support another person. They run at the slightest sign of trouble or pain. So which one are you going be?"

真正的朋友即使在最糟糕的时刻也会陪伴在身边。他们知道愤怒中说出的话很少是真相。朋友也会在朋友伤害他们时，提供倾听或依靠的肩膀。真正的朋友会保守任何托付给他们的秘密。" Hyuga 停下来，看 Shinji 是否理解了。"而熟人只在好时光出现，不需要支持他人时才在场。他们一有麻烦或痛苦的迹象就会逃跑。所以，你会成为哪一种呢？

"It's not that easy," stated Shinji. "There are things I should have done, but didn't."

这并不容易，" 真嗣说道，"有些事情我本应该做的，却没有去做。

"Shinji," interrupted Hyuga. "It is an easy choice but one of great importance. You already know your answer. You've been at her side for the last two years, visiting for hours at times and remembering dates that hold importance for only the two of you. You hound the doctors and nurses for any new developments or changes in her condition. I also hear of a couple fights that have happened at your school concerning Asuka." He drank some of his juice before continuing. "If those aren't signs of friendship then I don't know what is."

真嗣，" 日向打断道，"这是一个简单的选择，但却意义重大。你其实已经知道答案了。这两年来，你一直陪伴在她身边，有时一待就是几个小时，记住了只有你们俩才在乎的重要日子。你不断向医生和护士询问她病情的任何新进展或变化。我还听说你在学校因为明日香发生了几次争执。" 他喝了一口果汁，然后继续说，"如果这些都不算是友情的迹象，那我就不知道什么才是了。

"But…"

"Remember what had happened before she told you that she hated you. She had just had the darkest corners of her mind exposed to the 15th Angel." The two males stared at each other, neither looking away or flinching. "Asuka needs a friend, not an associate."

记住在她告诉你她恨你之前发生了什么。她刚刚让内心的最阴暗角落暴露给了第十五使徒。"两位男性对视着，谁也没有移开视线或退缩。"明日香需要的是朋友，而不是合作伙伴。

Both of them finished their meal in silence, each lost in their thoughts. Hyuga was wondering if he had pushed Shinji too far, too fast. But he knew the boy already knew the answer, he just wanted someone to clarify the situation. As they stood up, he noticed that the indecision and confusion were gone from Shinji's posture, though there was some nervousness in his eyes. That wouldn't disappear until he told Asuka that he was her friend and discovered what her reaction would be. As they stepped through the doors Shinji confirmed his guess.

两人默默地吃完了饭，各自沉浸在思绪中。日向在想自己是否对真嗣逼得太紧，太快了。但他知道真嗣已经知道答案，只是希望有人能澄清情况。当他们站起来时，他注意到真嗣的姿态中不再有犹豫和困惑，尽管眼中还有些许紧张。这种紧张感要等到他告诉明日香他是她的朋友，并了解她的反应后才会消失。当他们穿过门时，真嗣证实了他的猜测。

"I want to be her friend." Shinji closed his eyes and sighed, "I know there will be pain and some unpleasant events between us. But…"

我想成为她的朋友。" 碇真嗣闭上眼睛，叹了口气，"我知道我们之间会有痛苦和不愉快的事情。但是……

"But maybe you two can come to terms with each other and your feelings." Hyuga couldn't help but smile as Shinji started blushing.

"但或许你们俩能相互理解，接受彼此的感受。" 日向忍不住微笑，因为碇真嗣开始脸红了。

"Yeah, but that'll come much later."

是的，但那要很久以后了。

They returned to Asuka's wing, but found themselves still barred from the room by the medical personnel. Shinji sat in a chair across from the door, hoping to get a glimpse of Asuka, while Hyuga leaned against the wall with his arms crossed. Neither spoke as they maintained their watch, hoping for the best of news. To Shinji, each minute seemed an hour as he repeatedly looked at his watch. The chatter of the nurses was driving him crazy, yet none spoke to him.

他们回到了明日香的病房区，但仍被医护人员拦在门外。真嗣坐在门对面的椅子上，希望能看到明日香一眼，而日向则双臂交叉靠在墙上。两人都保持着沉默，守望着，期待着好消息。对真嗣来说，每一分钟都像一个小时，他不停地看着手表。护士们的闲聊让他心烦意乱，却没有人跟他说话。

"Shinji, I've got to go. I'm late for my watch as it is." Hyuga started walking away. "I'll tell Misato what's happening as soon as possible."

真嗣，我得走了。我已经迟到了。" 日向开始走开，"我会尽快告诉美里发生了什么。

"Okay."

Shinji watched the man walk off to the elevator, his hand raised in a wave. Sighing, he stood up and winced at the pain in his lower back from being hunched over. As he stretched he glanced at his watch, seeing that four hours had passed since Asuka had awoken. Sticking his hand in his pocket, he pulled out his wallet and opened it to check how much money he had and started walking to the vending machines. He needed to occupy his mind with something, even if it was just something to drink.

真嗣看着那个男人走向电梯，挥手告别。他叹了口气，站起来时因长时间弯腰而感到下背部疼痛。当他伸展身体时，瞥了一眼手表，发现自从明日香醒来已经过去了四个小时。他把手伸进口袋，拿出钱包检查了一下自己有多少钱，然后开始走向自动售货机。他需要用一些事情来占据自己的思绪，哪怕是只是喝点什么。

"Damn it," He muttered as he rested his head against the machine.

"该死，" 他低声嘟囔着，将头靠在机器上。

It felt like he had just been punched in the stomach as Asuka in her yellow dress stared back at him from his wallet. Feeding the money into the slot, he shut his wallet and punched for a can of green tea, hoping it would settle his stomach. Grabbing the can and opening it, he made his way back to his chair, taking sips along the way. As he sat down, footsteps approached and he found himself analyzing them. When they got within a few feet of him, he spoke.

当穿着黄色裙子的明日香从他的钱包里凝视着他时，他感觉像是被人猛击了腹部。他将钱塞进投币口，合上钱包，按下按钮买了一罐绿茶，希望它能平复他的胃。抓起罐子并打开，他一路走回椅子，边走边啜饮。坐下后，脚步声接近，他开始分析这些脚步声。当脚步声离他只有几英尺远时，他开口了。

"Hello Misato," His voice was calm and even, almost dead. "What took so long?"

你好，美里，" 他的声音平静而均匀，几乎毫无生气。"怎么这么久？

"I had a meeting for this morning. Sorry." She gently placed a hand on his shoulder. "So how is she?"

我今天早上有个会议。抱歉。" 她轻轻地将手放在他的肩上。"她怎么样了？

"I don't know!" He growled, "They kicked me out and haven't told me anything. She could be dead or dying for all I know!"

我不知道！"他咆哮道，"他们把我赶出来，什么也没告诉我。她可能已经死了，或者快要死了，我一无所知！

Misato crouched down in front of him and gently lifted his head. She was dressed in the black uniform of her rank of sub-Commander and had tucked her beret under an epaulet. Brushing her hair out of the way, she tried to get her thoughts together. Misato knew what Shinji was feeling at the moment because she was feeling the same. A sense of hopelessness and sadness overcame Misato, as she knew that neither she nor Shinji could do anything for Asuka. Smiling nervously she tried to brush away her and Shinji's fears.

葛城美里在他面前蹲下，轻轻抬起他的头。她身着代表她副指挥官级别的黑色制服，贝雷帽塞在肩章下。她拨开头发，试图整理思绪。美里深知此时真嗣的感受，因为她自己也感同身受。一种绝望和悲伤笼罩着美里，她明白无论是她还是真嗣，都无法为明日香做些什么。她紧张地微笑着，试图驱散自己和真嗣的恐惧。

"Shinji, you have to think positively. Asuka…"

真嗣，你要保持积极的心态。明日香……

"She isn't dying or dead."

Shinji looked past Misato to see who had interrupted their conversation. Standing in the doorway of Asuka's room was a middle-aged woman with brown hair down to her shoulders, wearing a long white medical jacket. Glasses and the traditional stethoscope completed the stereotypical picture of what everyone thought a doctor should look like. Giving him a smile she gestured that they could finally enter the room.

真嗣越过美里望向打断他们谈话的人。站在明日香房间门口的是一位中年女性，棕色长发披肩，身着一件长长的白色医疗外套。眼镜和传统的听诊器构成了人们心目中医生应有的典型形象。她朝他微笑着示意他们终于可以进入房间了。

"So is she stable, Dr. Uriyaka?" Misato asked quietly.

"那么，她稳定了吗，乌里亚卡医生？" 碇真嗣轻声问道。

"Yes, but there are some things I need to explain to you two about Asuka."

是的，但我需要向你们俩解释一些关于明日香的事情。

Shinji wasn't listening as he stepped through the door and into Asuka's room once again. The blinds had been drawn and sunlight streamed into the room with a white brilliance. He swallowed as he approached the bed that had been raised so that Asuka was now sitting. She looked even worse with her pale complexion and thinness in the sunlight. His footsteps didn't get a reaction from the girl and he sat down on the edge of her bed carefully. One of the nurses glanced at him and started to speak to him but stopped as another person touched her arm and they both left.

真嗣再次踏入明日香的房间时，并没有在听。窗帘已经拉上，阳光以一种洁白的光辉洒进房间。他咽了口唾沫，走向被抬高的床，现在明日香正坐着。在阳光下，她看起来更加苍白瘦弱。他的脚步声并没有引起女孩的反应，他小心翼翼地坐在床边。一位护士看了他一眼，正要开口说话，但另一个人碰了碰她的手臂，两人便离开了。

"Oh," mumbled Shinji. "哦，" 真嗣喃喃自语。

The redhead's eyes were closed and it looked like she was resting for a moment or she was simply ignoring him. Shinji noticed that the teddy bear that had been resting in her arm was gone. Bending over he spotted it under the table next to her bed, kicked there in the rush of the emergency. Brushing it off he sat back down and was preparing to place it next to Asuka when he noticed that her eyes were open.

红发女孩的眼睛闭着，看起来她似乎在休息片刻，或者只是在无视他。真嗣注意到原本在她怀里的泰迪熊不见了。他弯腰一看，发现它被踢到了床边的桌子底下，显然是在紧急情况下的匆忙中造成的。他拍了拍熊身上的灰尘，坐回原位，正准备把它放回明日香身边时，发现她的眼睛已经睁开了。

"Asuka, you're awake!" Shinji felt his heart race and involuntarily jerked away.

"明日香，你醒了！" 真嗣感到心跳加速，不由自主地往后一缩。

He was prepared for some kind of response from the girl, but nothing happened as she stared at him. He felt a pressure on his heart as he looked back into her blue eyes. There was no trace of anger or hatred in them, just an infinite sadness of someone filled with pain. The tube that provided oxygen made her appear sadder, if that was possible. His hand reached down to hold hers but Shinji stopped, remembering what Asuka had been like before regarding him touching her. Her lips trembled and her eyes were near tears as she saw him stop and draw back.

他预料到女孩会有某种反应，但什么也没发生，她只是盯着他看。当他回望她那双蓝色的眼睛时，感到心脏一阵压迫。她的眼中没有愤怒或仇恨，只有充满痛苦的无限悲伤。那根输送氧气的管子让她看起来更加悲伤，如果这还有可能的话。他的手伸下去想要握住她的手，但真嗣停住了，记起了以前阿苏卡对于他触碰她的态度。她的嘴唇颤抖着，眼中几乎含着泪水，看到他停下来并退缩。

"She needs human contact Shinji so I think it'll be all right," spoke the doctor.

"她需要人类的接触，真嗣，所以我想这应该没问题。" 医生说道。

Shinji looked over to see the two adults watching him and Asuka as they stopped talking. He felt his cheeks blush at the comment but he finally rested his hand on top of Asuka's. Her hand trembled under his but she didn't withdraw hers or push his away. Instead she slowly and painfully lifted her hand so she could grip Shinji's hand. He couldn't guess at how much pain Asuka was in from that simple movement as she leaned her head back and sighed. He felt even more nervous as she again returned to stare at him, never speaking a word. His nervousness grew as she looked at the stuffed animal in his hand before looking at him quizzically.

真嗣转头看去，发现两位成年人正注视着他和明日香，他们停止了交谈。他感到脸颊发烫，但最终还是把手放在了明日香的手上。她的手在他的手下颤抖，但她并没有抽回自己的手，也没有推开他的手。相反，她慢慢地、痛苦地抬起手，以便能握住真嗣的手。他无法猜测明日香从那个简单的动作中感受到了多少痛苦，她将头向后仰，叹了口气。当她再次凝视着他，一言不发时，他感到更加紧张。当她看着他手中的毛绒玩具，然后疑惑地看着他时，他的紧张感加剧了。

"Umm, yesterday was your birthday and I... I didn't know what to get you." He looked down at the sheets. "You must think that this is a stupid present."

呃，昨天是你的生日，我……我不知道该送你什么。" 他低头看着床单。"你一定觉得这个礼物很愚蠢吧。

The pressure on his hand grew and he looked up to see Asuka shaking her head. She released him and with both hands reached for the bear. Shinji could only watch as she held the bear in her hands and stared at it, like she couldn't decide what to do. After a while she released it and let it fall into her lap. Shinji could only watch as the sadness combined with frustration on her face as she tried to form words. But nothing came out except a harsh cough, as she was unable to speak.

他手上的压力逐渐增大，抬头一看，只见明日香摇着头。她松开他的手，用双手去抓那只熊。真嗣只能眼睁睁地看着她双手捧着熊，凝视着它，仿佛无法决定该做什么。过了一会儿，她松开手，让熊落在自己的腿上。真嗣只能看着她脸上的悲伤与挫败交织，试图开口说话，却只发出了一声刺耳的咳嗽，因为她无法言语。

Shinji could only sit there in shock as she tried again but still nothing came from Asuka's mouth. She turned her head away from him in frustration but he saw the tears sliding down her cheeks. Moving slowly, not even worried about any harm that could come from Asuka, Shinji reached up and wiped them away. He had been so absorbed in Asuka he jumped when a hand touched his shoulder, having forgotten about Misato and the doctor.

真嗣只能坐在那里，震惊地看着她再次尝试，但明日香的嘴里依旧没有发出任何声音。她沮丧地转过头去，但他看到了泪水从她的脸颊滑落。真嗣缓缓地移动，不再担心明日香可能带来的伤害，伸手为她擦去泪水。他全神贯注于明日香，以至于当一只手触碰到他的肩膀时，他吓了一跳，忘记了还有美里和医生在场。

"What happened to her?" his voice was a whisper.

"她怎么了？" 他的声音低得像耳语。

"She's forgotten how to talk," Uriyaka answered, pausing to think. "Forgotten really isn't the right word, but at the moment it is."

她已经忘了怎么说话，"乌里亚卡回答道，停顿了一下思考着。"说‘忘记’其实不太准确，但目前来说就是这样。

"What?"

"Asuka has not spoken for two years, Shinji." At this, Asuka could only hang her head in sorrow. "During this time she has 'forgotten' how to form the words, her muscles and vocal cords are unused to speaking."

明日香已经两年没有说话了，真嗣。"听到这里，明日香只能悲伤地低下头。"在这段时间里，她'忘记'了如何发声，她的肌肉和声带已经不习惯说话了。

Misato sat on the other side of Asuka and reached out for her hand tentatively, "So what now?"

美里坐在明日香对面，试探性地伸出手去握她的手，"那现在怎么办？"

"She'll have to attend speech therapy and relearn how to speak. Then will come the other various physicals and classes to learn how to walk and get used to her body again," she paused and looked at Misato. "And she'll need to attend those sessions I told you about."

她将不得不参加言语治疗，重新学习如何说话。接下来还有各种体能训练和课程，学习如何走路以及重新适应自己的身体，"她停顿了一下，看向美里。"而且她还需要参加我之前告诉你的那些课程。

Shinji tightened his hold on Asuka's hand as she trembled, "So how long before she can go home?"

真嗣紧握着颤抖的明日香的手，问道："那她还要多久才能回家？"

"Three months, hopefully."

三个月，希望如此。

"Three months!" This came from both Misato and Shinji.

"三个月！" 这来自碇真嗣和葛城美里两人。

Dr. Uriyaka just stared at them. "Yes, three months. Asuka has been through a lot in the past and she has a lot to do in the future. Unless you want something to go wrong I'm not going to release her any sooner." She lowered her voice, "Don't worry. Those three months will fly by, trust me. Now I think we should all leave so Asuka can get some sleep, real sleep."

乌里亚卡医生只是盯着他们。“是的，三个月。明日香过去经历了很多，未来也有很多事情要做。除非你想出什么差错，否则我不会提前让她出院。”她压低了声音，“别担心。这三个月会很快过去的，相信我。现在我想我们都应该离开，让明日香好好睡一觉，真正的睡眠。”

Shinji was about to say something when he felt the grip on his hand loosen. Looking at his roommate he saw that her eyes were closed and her head was tilted off to the side. Her cheeks were smudged with tear streaks but she looked better than before. Looking at Misato, Shinji pulled his hand away and stood up, but not before lowering the bed all the way. As they moved to the door Shinji heard a slight snore come from Asuka and he couldn't help but smile at that simple sound.

真嗣正要说话时，感觉到握着他的手松开了。他看向室友，发现她的眼睛已经闭上，头歪向一边。她的脸颊上还留有泪痕，但看起来比之前好多了。真嗣看向美里，抽回手站了起来，但在离开前把床完全放低。当他们走向门口时，真嗣听到明日香轻微的鼾声，他不禁对这个简单的声音露出了微笑。

Early January 2018 2018 年初

His throat was dry, like it always was whenever he came to this specific office, but Shinji didn't stop as he was ushered past the receptionist desk. He knew he should be used to the surroundings and the person who was waiting for him, yet he wasn't. In the past two years he had memorized every detail of the office from the desk to the view out the windows, even the ceiling had been committed to memory. So, with some apprehension, he triggered the door open, and stepped through the portal and into the office, walking across the open space before sitting down in a chair in front of the desk.

他的喉咙干涩，每当他来到这个特定的办公室时总是如此，但新二没有停下脚步，他被引导着经过接待台。他知道自己应该已经习惯了这里的周围环境和等待他的人，然而他并没有。在过去两年里，他记住了办公室的每一个细节，从桌子到窗外的景色，甚至连天花板都铭记在心。因此，带着些许忐忑，他打开了门，跨过门槛走进办公室，穿过开阔的空间，然后在办公桌前的椅子上坐下。

"Hello Shinji." The man's voice was tightly controlled, giving no hints of his emotions. "It's been almost two months since our last meeting."

你好，真嗣。" 男人的声音控制得很紧，没有透露出他的情绪。"距离我们上次见面已经快两个月了。

Shinji bowed his head. "I'm sorry Dr. Leibling, I've sort of been busy lately and completely forgot."

真嗣低下头。"对不起，莱布林博士，我最近有点忙，完全忘记了。"

The young man winced, as he knew how stupid that excuse must sound to the doctor, as everyone used it when they couldn't come up with something better. Yet it was the truth since he had been spending more time with Asuka since she had woken up and scheduling an appointment with the psychologist had not been important. As he looked down at his hands, he noticed he was clenching his fists and knew it was that time with Asuka that had finally forced him to make an appointment to see Leibling. Shinji knew he needed to talk to someone about what was occurring before something happened that could not be corrected.

年轻人皱了皱眉，他知道这个借口在医生听来一定很愚蠢，因为每当人们想不出更好的理由时都会用它。然而，这是事实，因为他自从明日香醒来后，就花更多时间陪她，预约心理医生的重要性便被抛诸脑后。当他低头看着自己的手时，发现自己正紧握着拳头，意识到正是与明日香相处的时光最终促使他预约了见莱布林医生。真嗣知道，他需要找人谈谈正在发生的事情，以免发生无法挽回的后果。

"That's all right; in fact we really don't need to have monthly sessions anymore. You've progressed nicely since we started, much better than some of my patients."

没关系，实际上我们也不再需要每月会面了。自从我们开始治疗以来，你的进步也很好，比我的某些病人要好得多。

Shinji felt his cheeks heat up at the compliment and watched as the older man stood up and made his way around the desk. He flinched when Leibling rested his hand on his shoulder for a moment. As the psychologist sat in a chair across from him, Shinji started organizing his thoughts, wanting to be able to convey what he was feeling without wasting too much time. It was only this organization that had halved their sessions from three hours in the beginning to the current hour and a half.

真嗣感到自己的脸颊因赞美而发热，他看着那位年长的男士站起来，绕过桌子走过来。当莱布林将手短暂地放在他的肩膀上时，他不禁一缩。心理学家坐在他对面的椅子上，真嗣开始整理思绪，希望能够在不浪费太多时间的情况下表达自己的感受。正是这种整理，使得他们的会谈时间从最初的三小时缩短到了现在的一个半小时。

"So how is she?" Leibling asked after some silence, a smile on his face.

"那么她怎么样了？"莱布林在片刻沉默后问道，脸上带着微笑。

"Asuka… she’s better now then when she woke up."

明日香……她现在比刚醒来时好多了。

Leibling chuckled lightly, "Shinji you were a poor liar when I first met you and you still are. I can't help you if you don't tell me what’s wrong."

亲爱的轻笑一声，“真嗣，我第一次遇见你时你就很不擅长撒谎，现在依然如此。如果你不告诉我出了什么问题，我无法帮助你。”

"I wasn't lying!" shouted Shinji before calming. "I’m telling the truth. She is doing better."

我并没有撒谎！" 真嗣大声喊道，随后平静下来。"我说的都是真的。她现在好多了。

"But."

Shinji sat there with his eyes closed, willing his hands to open. "But she's starting to put her walls back up. She's trying to push people away and I know that’s wrong."

真嗣坐在那里，闭着眼睛，努力让自己的手张开。“但她又开始筑起心墙了。她试图推开别人，我知道这是不对的。”

"How do you know it's wrong?" prodded Leibling.

"你怎么知道这是不对的？" 莱布林追问道。

"It's like you told me before, if I always kept running from people, I would’ve never known what it is to live. And if I always looked to others to provide support or comfort I would never know happiness." He glanced up and smiled faintly. "That’s what finally made me realize I had been using her as a false support and forced me to reevaluate what I wanted from Asuka and what I wanted to give her."

就像你之前告诉我的，如果我一直逃避与人交往，我将永远不会知道生活的真谛。如果我总是依赖他人提供支持和安慰，我将永远不会懂得幸福。" 他抬头望去，微微一笑。"正是这一点让我最终意识到，我一直把她当作虚假的依靠，迫使我重新审视我对明日香的需求以及我想要给予她的东西。

"You didn't answer my question, Shinji. Why is it wrong for Asuka to put her walls up?"

你没有回答我的问题，真嗣。为什么明日香筑起心墙就是错的呢？

"Damn it, because it creates a cycle."

该死，因为这会形成一个恶性循环。

Leibling saw Shinji's eyes light up as he reached a crucial understanding. "A cycle of what?"

亲爱的看到真嗣的眼睛亮了起来，因为他达到了一个关键的理解。“什么循环？”

"A cycle of pain. She did it when she was piloting and fighting the Angels but I didn't see it."

“痛苦的循环。她在驾驶和对抗使徒时经历了这一切，但我当时并未察觉。”

"Hindsight is 20-20. Plus you had your own problems." The doctor leaned back in his chair and watched Shinji. "So what does this cycle do?"

事后看来总是清晰明了。况且你也有自己的问题。" 医生靠在椅背上，注视着真嗣。"那么这个循环是做什么的？

The young man took a deep breath, and slowly released it. "It just increases her pain. She pushes people away to protect herself but then she has no one to turn to for help, so she buries the pain deeper which makes her lash out even more which increases the pain and so on and so forth." Shinji's voice had filled with sorrow as he said those words and it broke. "All she’s doing is hurting herself in the hope to be free of pain."

年轻人深吸一口气，缓缓呼出。"它只会加剧她的痛苦。她推开别人以保护自己，但随后她无人可求助，于是她将痛苦深埋，这使她更加猛烈地反击，从而加剧了痛苦，如此循环往复。" 真嗣的声音充满了悲伤，说到这里时哽咽了。"她所做的只是以伤害自己的方式，希望摆脱痛苦。"

"Just like you and your running away. You realized that running does not make the pain go away but only increases it." Shinji nodded at those words and the doctor went on. "Asuka has to be shown that pushing people away and putting up walls is harmful to her well-being."

就像你逃避一样。你意识到逃避并不能减轻痛苦，反而加剧了它。" 真嗣对这些话点了点头，医生继续说道："明日香必须明白，推开别人和筑起心墙对她自己的健康是有害的。

"I know that!" Shinji abruptly stood and went to a nearby window. "But I don't know what to do to stop her from pushing me or others away!"

我知道！" 真嗣突然站起来，走向附近的窗户。"但我不知道该怎么做才能阻止她推开我或其他人！

"You're approaching the problem the wrong way Shinji. At the moment it doesn't matter if she pushes others away."

你解决这个问题的方法不对，真嗣。现在她是否把别人推开并不重要。

Shinji whirled around and stared at Leibling. "Yes it does matter!"

真嗣猛地转过身来，盯着莱布林。"不，这很重要！"

"Please Shinji, I haven’t finished?" He stood up and came over to Shinji's side. "If everyone tells her that she needs to open up, she’ll just strengthen her walls. One person can succeed where many fail. You did the same when your friends and colleagues told you to stop running."

请听我说，真嗣，我还没说完呢？" 他站起身，走到真嗣身边。"如果大家都告诉她需要敞开心扉，她只会更加筑起心墙。一个人或许能在众人失败的地方取得成功。你以前不也是这样吗，当你的朋友和同事让你别再逃避时。

"She isn't me, though." 但她毕竟不是我。

"Exactly." He beckoned for Shinji to follow him to the far side of the room. "Asuka is not like you and we can not approach her problem in the same fashion. You were filled with guilt over your friends, your father and your actions. That is not true of Asuka."

正是如此。"他示意真嗣跟他到房间的另一头。"明日香和你不一样，我们不能用同样的方式来处理她的问题。你因为朋友、父亲和自己的行为而充满内疚，但明日香并非如此。

"How do you know?" asked Shinji, his voice sharp in anger.

"你怎么知道的？"真嗣问道，声音中带着愤怒的尖锐。

"She'll be my patient and I have her psychology reports."

她将成为我的病人，我手头有她的心理报告。

Shinji pressed his forehead against the glass, staring at the sight below him. "Isn't this violating the patient-doctor code? You telling me about Asuka."

真嗣将额头紧贴在玻璃上，凝视着下方的景象。“这不是违反了医患守则吗？你竟然告诉我关于明日香的事。”

"No, because you’ve been reaching the conclusions by yourself with a little help from me." He stepped closer to the boy. "Now, you’re straying off the subject. How do you break her emotional cycle?"

不，因为你一直是自己得出结论，我只是稍加帮助。"他向男孩走近了一步。"现在，你偏离了主题。你如何打破她的情感循环？

"I don't know."

"I think you do. Look down there." Leibling pointed down at the street.

我想你确实看到了。看下面那里。" 莱布林指着街道说道。

Shinji watched the scene below him, trying to figure out what the doctor was talking about. He watched as the pedestrians crossed the street when given the correct light. The same happened with the vehicles on the different cross streets. Everything was organized, a cycle of red and green lights that allowed traffic to flow smoothly. Shinji felt like an idiot as he finally realized what the doctor was saying about Asuka and how other people didn't matter at the moment.

真嗣俯视着下方的场景，试图弄清楚医生在说什么。他看到行人在绿灯亮起时穿过街道，同样的情况也发生在不同交叉街道上的车辆上。一切井然有序，红绿灯的循环使得交通流畅。当真嗣终于明白医生关于明日香的言论，以及此刻其他人并不重要时，他觉得自己像个傻瓜。

"You break a cycle by taking away something or altering the flow of materials. Asuka's cycle of pain is dependent on certain steps to continue." Shinji turned grinning. "Thanks for your time." With that he turned to go but a hand on his arm stopped him. "What?"

打破一个循环，要么是移除某些东西，要么是改变物质的流动。明日香的痛苦循环依赖于某些步骤来维持。" 真嗣转过身，咧嘴一笑。"谢谢你的时间。" 说完他转身要走，但一只手搭在他的手臂上阻止了他。"怎么了？

"People are not like machines Shinji. They're far more delicate and require special care." He stared into Shinji's eyes. "What are you planning?"

人们不像机器，真嗣。他们更加脆弱，需要特别的关怀。" 他凝视着真嗣的眼睛。"你打算做什么？

"I'm not going to let her push me away or allow her to be alone anymore."

我不会让她再把我推开，也不会再让她孤单一人了。

- - - -

With a smile on his face, Shinji walked through the halls on his way to Asuka's room. The half-hour session with the psychologist had helped him figure out a path to help Asuka. He could only hope the experience wouldn't be a painful one, physically as he remembered the few times that Asuka had hit him before. He stopped to let a nurse and her patient go past him and it was that pause that allowed him to overhear a couple of nurses.

真嗣面带微笑，穿过走廊前往明日香的房间。与心理医生的半小时会谈帮助他找到了帮助明日香的方法。他只能希望这个过程不会太痛苦，身体上的痛苦，因为他还记得之前几次明日香打他的情景。他停下来让一位护士和她的病人先过去，正是这一停顿让他无意中听到了两位护士的对话。

"What a child she is. I don't want this, and I don't want that. I've never met someone so immature in my life, Akari."

她真是个孩子，这个不要，那个也不想要。我这辈子还没遇到过这么不成熟的人，明里。

"You just don't understand Asuka."

你只是不了解明日香。

"I understand that she can be quite the little bitch."

我明白她有时确实挺刻薄的。

Shinji stepped up to the station, standing behind the nurses who had their backs to him. Clearing his throat Shinji got their attention with the one who had called Asuka a bitch looking irritated. The irritation vanished when she saw who had stopped her conversation. While Shinji couldn't report her, he could tell Misato, who could ensure that the nurse never worked for NERV again. But Shinji ignored that nurse and looked at Akari, who had an embarrassed look on her face.

真嗣走向车站，站在背对着他的护士们身后。他清了清嗓子，引起了她们的注意，其中那位曾辱骂明日香为婊子的护士显得很恼火。但当她看到是谁打断了她们的谈话时，怒气顿时消失了。虽然真嗣不能直接举报她，但他可以告诉美里，美里有能力确保这名护士再也不会为 NERV 工作。然而，真嗣忽略了那名护士，转而看向满脸尴尬的茜。

"Why don't you go get something to drink?" suggested Akari to the other nurse, who quickly agreed and left.

"你为什么不去喝点东西呢？"茜向另一名护士提议，对方立刻同意并离开了。

Shinji waited patiently with his arms crossed for Akari to turn back to him. He knew that she would explain what was happening with Asuka and the nurses. His prediction came true as she left the station and motioned for him to follow her to a different corridor. She stopped after turning the corner and motioned for him to sit. Leaning back, Shinji looked up at the nurse and waited.

真嗣耐心地交叉双臂等待，相信茜会回头向他解释明日香和护士们的情况。果然，她离开工作台，示意他跟随到另一个走廊。转过拐角后，她停下脚步，示意他坐下。真嗣靠后坐定，抬头望向护士，静待其言。

"I'm sorry you heard that. Megumi is new and Asuka's has been giving us some trouble lately." Akari didn't look at Shinji as she spoke.

"很抱歉你听到了这些。惠是新来的，而明日香最近给我们带来了不少麻烦。" 茜说话时并未看向真嗣。

"What kind of trouble?" Shinji asked.

"什么麻烦？" 真嗣问道。

"I know she's just being stubborn but it's making our jobs harder to do."

我知道她只是固执，但这让我们的工作更难做了。

"What kind of trouble Akari?" repeated Shinji.

"什么麻烦，明里？" 新二重复道。

Akari sighed and made eye contact with Shinji. "She doesn't want to eat what’s given to her so we've had to put her back on the IV. She doesn't like the clothes she’s wearing or the colors. It's not just that; she's refusing to listen to her therapist." She stopped and looked at Shinji as he smiled. "What? This isn't funny Shinji, we're close to reporting her to Misato."

明里叹了口气，与新二目光相接。"她不想吃给她的东西，所以我们不得不让她重新用上静脉注射。她不喜欢她穿的衣服或颜色。不仅如此；她拒绝听从她的治疗师。" 她停下来，看着新二微笑。"怎么了？这不好笑，新二，我们快要向美里报告她了。"

"Nothing, except why don't you let me try?"

什么也不为，只是你为什么不让我试试呢？

"And how will you succeed?"

那你打算怎么成功呢？

Shinji shrugged his shoulders. "I know a few things about Asuka that might work. What harm is there in letting me try to help."

真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“我对明日香有些了解，或许能帮上忙。让我试试又有何妨。”

"Fine."

An hour later Shinji was again walking to Asuka's room, but this time he was prepared. He had spent the hour gathering materials for Asuka and talking to certain people. It was convincing those people to let him try that had taken so long, though he knew getting Asuka to cooperate might take longer. Stopping the cart, he opened the door and entered the room, letting the door close with a click behind him. He didn't look at Asuka as he pushed the cart next to her bed, then walked to a nearby chair and sat. She sat there staring at him with a puzzled look on her face that slowly changed to anger, as Shinji remained silent.

一小时后，真嗣再次走向明日香的房间，但这次他已做好准备。他花了一小时收集给明日香的材料，并与某些人交谈。说服这些人让他尝试花费了很长时间，尽管他知道让明日香合作可能需要更长时间。他停下推车，打开门进入房间，让门咔哒一声关上。他没有看向明日香，而是将推车推到她的床边，然后走到附近的椅子坐下。她坐在那里，用困惑的表情盯着他，这表情逐渐转为愤怒，因为真嗣始终保持沉默。

"Leave." commanded Asuka.

"离开。" 阿苏卡命令道。

"No." replied Shinji. "不。" 真嗣回答。

"I don't need you or your help." She stated before turning to look at the wall.

"我既不需要你，也不需要你的帮助。"她说完便转头望向墙壁。

Because of that, she didn't see Shinji stand and walk to her bed, only realizing that he had moved when he sat down. "Sorry but I'm not going to let you push me anymore. And I'm not going to run away from you and leave you alone. So you better accept that fact."

正因为如此，她没有看到真嗣站起来走向她的床，直到他坐下时才意识到他已经移动了。"对不起，但我不会再让你逼迫我了。我也不会逃避你，留下你一个人。所以你最好接受这个事实。"

The sound of flesh hitting flesh was heard in the room as Asuka's hand connected with Shinji's cheek. He looked down at her face to see a combination of anger and hate but also some hope and sorrow. Reaching up, Shinji gently gripped Asuka's wrist, feeling her tremble, and wondering if it was in fear or pain. Slowly he lowered her hand back to the bed and let go of Asuka. Standing, he removed the lid from the tray he had gotten from the cafeteria.

房间里传来肉体撞击肉体的声音，那是明日香的手掌打在真嗣脸颊上的声音。他低头看向她的脸，那里混合着愤怒与憎恨，却也夹杂着一丝希望与悲伤。真嗣伸出手，轻轻握住明日香的手腕，感觉到她在颤抖，不知是因为恐惧还是痛苦。他缓缓将她的手放回床上，然后松开。站起身，他揭开了从食堂拿来的托盘上的盖子。

"I don't want to be babied," Asuka commented.

"我不想被当成小孩子对待，"明日香评论道。

Shinji didn't say anything until he was seated again. "I'm not going to baby you. If you don't want to eat and be fed by an IV, fine. If you don't want to change, I won't force you." He swallowed as he saw the pain on Asuka’s face. "It’s up to you what you want to do and how long you want to stay in the hospital, but I want to help. I can buy you some new clothes, or bring you some food besides cafeteria food." Shinji glanced down in embarrassment. "The therapist said I could help you if you agreed.”

真嗣直到再次坐下才开口。"我不会把你当小孩子。如果你不想吃饭而想通过静脉注射进食，随你。如果你不想换衣服，我也不会强迫你。" 他看到明日香脸上的痛苦，咽了咽口水。"你想做什么，想在医院待多久，都由你决定，但我希望能帮到你。我可以给你买些新衣服，或者带些除了食堂以外的食物给你。" 真嗣尴尬地低下头。"治疗师说我可以在你同意的情况下帮助你。"

"Why…why are you doing this?" whispered Asuka.

"为什么……你为什么要这么做？" 明日香低声问道。

"Because I want to show you that I care about you, that you don't have to push me away or be alone." Shinji bowed his head as he continued. "Most of all I want to regain your trust. I betrayed that trust when I didn't help you when you needed it the most. It took me a while to figure out that what happened between us was because of that betrayal."

因为我想向你证明我在乎你，你不必推开我或独自一人。" 碇真嗣低下头继续说道，"最重要的是，我想重新获得你的信任。当我没有在你最需要帮助的时候伸出援手，我背叛了那份信任。我花了很长时间才明白，我们之间发生的事情是因为那次背叛。

"Stop it!" Asuka yelled. "Will you stop blaming yourself for things that you can't control! What happened to me…" She paused and wiped her eyes. "What happened to me was my own fault."

别这样了！" 明日香喊道，"你能不能不要再为那些你无法控制的事情自责了！我发生的事……" 她停顿了一下，擦了擦眼睛，"我发生的事是我自己的错。

"No, it was both our faults." Shinji said as he sat next to her again. "You trusted me to be your teammate and vice versa but we failed at that for various reasons." He gently placed his hand over hers. "Now I want you to trust me, Asuka. I don't want to see you alone or hurting, and I won't let you push me away. I will not treat you as a child but I expect you to be mature and accept my help. Please trust me." With that he squeezed her hand.

"不，这是我们两个人的错。" 真嗣说着再次坐到她旁边，"你信任我作为你的队友，反之亦然，但我们因为种种原因失败了。" 他温柔地将手放在她的手上，"现在我希望你信任我，明日香。我不想看到你孤单或受伤，我不会让你推开我。我不会把你当孩子看待，但我希望你能成熟地接受我的帮助。请相信我。" 说完，他握紧了她的手。

Asuka looked down at her lap as she thought about what Shinji had just said about trusting him or asking for help. Glancing over, she saw him staring at her, waiting for a reply, yet his eyes were not pleading with her. It would all come down to what she wanted do, not what Shinji wanted her to do. Staring at him in this setting she finally realized that Shinji had matured both physically and emotionally. She had been seeing the emotional side since waking but she was just beginning to see him in a different light physically. Reaching up, Asuka ran a finger along his jaw.

明日香低头看着自己的膝盖，思考着真嗣刚刚关于信任他或寻求帮助的话语。她瞥了一眼，发现他正凝视着她，等待着回应，然而他的眼神并没有恳求。这一切将取决于她想要做什么，而不是真嗣希望她做什么。在这样的场景中凝视着他，她终于意识到真嗣在身体和情感上都成熟了。自从醒来后，她一直在观察他的情感方面，但现在才开始从身体上以不同的眼光看待他。她伸手用手指轻抚他的下巴。

"You need to shave and get a haircut Shinji, you can't match Kaji."

你得刮刮胡子，剪剪头发了，真嗣，你没法和加持相比。

"I wasn't trying to copy Kaji."

我不是故意要模仿加持的。

"I know." Asuka let her hand fall and closed her eyes. Opening her eyes, she turned her head to look at Shinji. "I try to walk for the first time tomorrow.

我知道。" 明日香放下手，闭上了眼睛。睁开眼后，她转头看向真嗣。"我明天要尝试第一次走路。

Shinji squeezed her hand again. "I'll be there."

真嗣再次握紧了她的手。“我会在那里的。”

"Thank you." 谢谢你。

Early February 2018 2018 年初

"Please stop."

Shinji stopped ruffling through the pile of materials at a nearby table and turned to look at Asuka. She sat in her bed with her hands folded in her lap, staring at him. Her blues eyes would still fill with sadness at times, even two months after waking. Not even finally being able to talk and walk again had brightened her downcast mood. Shinji sighed, wondering if anything would make Asuka smile or just be happy. Slowly he walked over to a chair next to her bed and propped his elbows on his knees, staring at the girl, waiting for her to finish.

真嗣停止了在附近桌子上翻找资料的动作，转头看向明日香。她坐在床上，双手交叠放在腿上，凝视着他。尽管醒来已有两个月，她那蓝色的眼睛仍不时充满悲伤。即便最终能够再次说话和行走，也未能使她低落的情绪有所好转。真嗣叹了口气，思索着是否有什么能让明日香微笑或仅仅是感到快乐。他缓缓走向她床边的椅子，双肘撑在膝盖上，凝视着女孩，等待她结束。

"I'm tired of this Shinji, please no more."

真嗣，我已经厌倦了这一切，请不要再这样了。

Shinji tried not to groan in frustration, "But Asuka you need…"

真嗣试图不让自己因沮丧而呻吟，“但是，明日香，你需要……”

"Shinji!" Her voice took on a different tone. "Please just listen. I'm tired of this." She placed a hand on his knee. "It's not that I'm not grateful for the help, I am. It's just that I'm tired of this routine."

真嗣！" 她的声音变了调。"请听我说。我厌倦了这一切。" 她把手放在他的膝盖上。"并不是我不感激你的帮助，我很感激。只是我厌倦了这种例行公事。

He tried to interrupt, "But…"

他试图插话：“但是…”

"Let me finish, will you?" Her eyes brightened a little, "It's been the same thing for the last months. I get up, go to therapy, go to speech class and come back here. You haven't helped either by always having something for me to do." The corners of her mouth quivered but still she didn't smile. "I know you promised to help me, it's just…"

让我说完，好吗？"她的眼睛微微一亮，"这几个月来都是同样的事情。我起床，去接受治疗，去上语言课，然后回到这里。你也没有帮到我，总是有事情让我做。"她的嘴角微微颤抖，但仍然没有笑意。"我知道你承诺过要帮助我，只是……

"Just what?"

Asuka stared at the far wall as she spoke. "I want to go outside. I want to lie in the grass, feel the wind and sun on me." She stopped as Shinji laughed slightly. "What’s so funny?"

明日香凝视着远处的墙壁，开口说道：“我想去外面。我想躺在草地上，感受风和阳光。”她停了下来，因为真嗣轻声笑了。“有什么好笑的？”

"Nothing except that you would never have talked like that before."

除了你以前绝不会那样说话之外，什么也没有。

"Well being catatonic for two years will change anybody." At that statement she lowered her eyes to her lap and frowned.

"连续两年处于木僵状态，任何人都会有所改变。"听到这句话，她垂下眼帘，眉头紧锁。

Shinji stood up and sat next to her on the bed as she plucked at the sheets. He didn't reach out for her hands, knowing that at the moment it wouldn't be right. The times he had held her hand had been slowly growing more infrequent as Asuka went through her therapy. He knew that the time where they would no longer hold hands was fast approaching, as that was more for couples than friends. Pushing that thought out of his head, Shinji instead concentrated on how Asuka was trying to change back to her old self.

真嗣站起来，坐到她床边，看着她扯着床单。他没有伸手去握她的手，知道此刻这样做并不合适。随着明日香接受治疗，他们牵手的时候越来越少。他明白，不再牵手的日子即将到来，因为那更多是情侣之间而非朋友之间的举动。真嗣将这个念头抛诸脑后，转而关注明日香如何努力恢复成原来的自己。

Her eyes were softer as she looked up and Shinji found it hard to speak, "Um…so why didn't you…say that?"

她抬头时眼神柔和，真嗣发现难以开口：“呃……那你为什么……不早说呢？”

"Because a certain someone didn't allow me," Asuka stared into Shinji's eyes causing him to shift in his chair. "So are you up to helping me outside?"

“因为某个家伙不让我说，”明日香直视着真嗣的眼睛，让他不由得在椅子上挪动了一下。“那你愿意帮我出去吗？”

"You want to walk?" He couldn't believe what he was hearing.

"你想去散步吗？" 他简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。

"Yes."

"No." Shinji crossed his arms and glared at the girl. "You just started walking again, and that was for short distances. The gardens are on the other side of the hospital."

“不行。”真嗣交叉双臂，瞪着女孩。“你才刚恢复走路，还只能走短距离。花园在医院的另一头。”

"But Shinji I need to do this. I need to prove that I can walk by myself outside of a therapy room." Shinji found his resolve disappearing as Asuka pleaded, "Please help me do this."

但是真嗣，我必须这么做。我需要证明我能在治疗室之外自己走路。" 真嗣发现自己的决心在明日香的恳求下逐渐消失，"请帮帮我，让我做到这一点。

"No fair," muttered Shinji. "Only on one condition. No, two actually."

这不公平，" 真嗣嘟囔道。"只有一个条件。不，实际上是两个。

"And they are?" Asuka asked quietly.

"他们是谁？" 明日香轻声问道。

He held up one finger as he started, "I’m helping you." Asuka frowned, but nodded in agreement. "Two, if you feel tired or in pain you ride the rest of the way."

他竖起一根手指开始说道："我在帮你。" 明日香皱了皱眉，但还是点头同意了。"第二，如果你感到疲倦或疼痛，你就骑完全程。"

"Okay."

Asuka turned and looked out the window to the blue sky with a few clouds floating serenely in the wind. In the past month, that had been her goal, to go outside, away from the doctors and nurses, and the pain of therapy, even if it was just for a short time. Sure she was awake and trying to return to normal but as long as she was in the hospital she felt confined. As a cloud drifted in front of the sun she decided she would abide by Shinji's rules, anything to get out of her physical prison. She looked back at the boy when she felt the bed shift as he moved closer to her.

明日香转过身，望向窗外蔚蓝的天空，几朵云彩在风中宁静地飘浮。在过去的一个月里，她的目标一直是走出去，远离医生和护士，远离治疗的痛苦，哪怕只是短暂的一会儿。当然，她已经醒来，并试图恢复正常，但只要她还在医院里，她就感觉被束缚。当一朵云飘过太阳时，她决定遵守真嗣的规则，只要能逃离这个有形的牢笼。她回头看向那个男孩，感觉到床随着他的靠近而移动。

After pushing her bed table, which contained her school materials, off to one side and tossing the blankets to the foot of the bed, Asuka moved next to Shinji and let her legs hang over the side. She gasped a little when her bare feet touched the cold tiles before she slid them into slippers. Turning her head she saw Shinji staring at her with a concerned look. She had tried to avoid worrying Shinji since she had woken up but she had been unable to regain the old fire no matter how much effort she put into it.

明日香将放有学习资料的床桌推到一边，把被子扔到床尾，然后挪到真嗣旁边，让双腿悬在床边。当她的赤脚触到冰冷的瓷砖时，她微微倒吸一口气，随后将脚滑进拖鞋。她转过头，看到真嗣正关切地盯着她。自从醒来后，她一直试图不让真嗣担心，但她无论怎么努力，都无法重燃往日的激情。

Shinji tried to read Asuka but all he found was emptiness. Moving closer to Asuka he wrapped an arm around her midsection and smiled when she did the same a moment later. He tried not to think of how warm and soft she was when they tightened the hold on each other, feeling his face heat up as he failed. He turned his head and spent a few seconds pushing those thoughts out of his mind. They were completely inappropriate at the time, and he felt his hands clenching tightly as his breathing became ragged in shame and anger at the way that he was thinking of Asuka.

真嗣试图读懂明日香，但所见唯有空洞。他向她靠近，手臂环住她的腰际，当她片刻后也做出同样动作时，他微笑了。他努力不去想她有多温暖柔软，当他们彼此紧抱时，他感到自己的脸颊发热，因为这些念头挥之不去。他转过头，花了几秒钟将这些思绪赶出脑海。在当时，这些想法完全不合时宜，他感到自己的手紧握着，呼吸因羞愧和愤怒而变得急促，因为他竟然这样想着明日香。

"Can we go?" 我们能走吗？

Her quiet voice knocked Shinji out of his reverie. Turning back, he saw Asuka simply sitting there watching him. "Of course."

她轻柔的声音将真嗣从沉思中唤醒。他转过身，看到明日香只是静静地坐在那里注视着他。“当然。”

Asuka closed her eyes and started to stand, feeling Shinji rise at the same time next to her. She gritted her teeth, not wanting to worry Shinji, when pain shot through her legs as they finally straightened. Without saying a word she took a step toward the door, Asuka felt a little joy as her knees didn't tremble or threaten to send her falling and she took another step. Never removing her eyes from the door, she continued with Shinji's help until the metal doorknob was under her hand. The complaints of the nurses were a buzz in her ears, yet she didn't stop on her journey. Even Shinji's voice was muted as he talked to one of the nurses who tried to stop them. But none of that mattered to the girl at the moment, as she just wanted to go outside.

明日香闭上眼睛，开始站起来，感觉到真嗣同时在她旁边起身。她咬紧牙关，不想让真嗣担心，当她的双腿终于伸直时，一阵疼痛袭来。她没有说一句话，就向门口迈出了一步，明日香感到一丝喜悦，因为她的膝盖没有颤抖或威胁要让她跌倒，于是她又迈出了一步。她的目光始终没有离开门，在真嗣的帮助下继续前行，直到金属门把手触手可及。护士们的抱怨在她耳边嗡嗡作响，但她没有停下脚步。即使真嗣的声音也被减弱了，因为他正在与试图阻止他们的护士交谈。但对那一刻的女孩来说，这些都不重要，她只想走出去。

Ten minutes later the little joy that she had felt was gone and her spark was fading as pain shot through her body with each step. Her breathing was becoming ragged and she knew that soon Shinji would have her sitting in a wheelchair to finish her journey. Lowering her head in defeat, Asuka stumbled as she mistimed her step to Shinji's and her arm loosened. It didn't matter anymore if she reached the gardens since she failed to keep her promise to Shinji. She didn't even look up as Shinji tightened his hold on her as they stepped through another door.

十分钟后，她感受到的那点小快乐消失了，随着每一步身体传来的疼痛，她的活力也在消退。她的呼吸变得急促，她知道不久后真嗣就会让她坐在轮椅上完成旅程。低头认输的明日香，因为没跟上真嗣的步伐而踉跄，手臂也松了下来。她是否能到达花园已经不重要了，因为她没能遵守对真嗣的承诺。当他们穿过另一扇门时，她甚至没有抬头，只是真嗣更紧地抓住了她。

"We're here." Shinji whispered to Asuka.

"我们到了。" 真嗣轻声对明日香说。

He watched out of the corner of his eye as Asuka lifted her head and stared at the scene before her. Shinji had not said a word during the trip when he had started feeling Asuka tremble during walking or heard her hard breathing. He had not wanted to see the light go out of Asuka's eyes or her determination disappear before they were outside. He was saddened to see the fire die in Asuka as she gave in to the defeat. Watching Asuka look over the garden and her hair wave in the breeze he waited for a reaction.

他用眼角余光注视着，只见明日香抬起头，凝视着眼前的景象。在旅途中，真嗣并未发一言，却感受到了明日香行走时的颤抖，听到了她沉重的呼吸。他不愿目睹明日香眼中的光芒熄灭，不愿在她走出户外前看到她的决心消逝。看到明日香屈服于挫败，眼中的火焰逐渐黯淡，他感到悲伤。望着明日香眺望花园，发丝在微风中飘扬，他等待着她的反应。

"So it turns out you are capable of smiling."

“看来你还是能笑得出来的。”

Asuka lowered her gaze from the sky and turned it on Shinji, seeing tears on his cheeks. She thought that he was lying about her smiling but as she stood there she realized that she was. With her free hand she brushed her hair out of her face and stared out over the gardens. Paths lead to various areas with stone benches spaced far apart for privacy. Taking a step, she started walking down the central path toward a patch of green some distance away. Along the way she looked at the flowers and ponds, as she couldn’t remember ever just taking in the calm of nature.

明日香从天空中收回目光，转向真嗣，看到他脸颊上的泪水。她以为他在撒谎说她笑了，但当她站在那里时，她意识到自己确实笑了。她用空着的手把头发从脸上拨开，凝视着花园。小径通往各个区域，石凳间隔得很远，以保证私密性。她迈出一步，开始沿着中央小径向远处的一片绿色走去。一路上，她看着花朵和池塘，因为她不记得自己曾如此平静地感受过大自然。

As Shinji helped her to the ground and sat beside her he saw the smile disappear. "What's the matter Asuka?" He frowned as she lied back in the grass. "You have a beautiful smile."

当真嗣帮助她坐到地上并坐在她旁边时，他看到笑容消失了。“怎么了，明日香？”他皱着眉头，看着她躺在草地上。“你的笑容很美。”

She turned her head at the comment to see Shinji blushing, but instead of brightening her mood it had the opposite affect. Asuka turned on her side giving Shinji a view of her back. "Then how come I don't feel happy? I feel so empty inside, completely useless." A tear slid down her cheek. "At times I wonder why I did wake up. Why didn't I just stay catatonic? It would have been so much easier."

她听到那句话后转过头，看到真嗣脸红，但这并没有让她的心情好转，反而产生了相反的效果。明日香侧过身，让真嗣只能看到她的背。“那为什么我不觉得快乐呢？我内心感到如此空虚，完全无用。”一滴泪滑过她的脸颊。“有时候我在想，我为什么要醒来。为什么我不干脆一直处于木僵状态？那样会容易得多。”

Shinji didn't have a reply to any of that. Any response he thought of was immediately dismissed as he saw how empty it truly was. Moving over to Asuka, he grabbed her shoulders and pulled her up even as she struggled against him. He wrapped his arms around her when she was upright, feeling her tremble. His own tears soaked the shoulder of the blue T-shirt that he had bought her, while her own tears hit his arms. With her remarks, he realized why she hadn't smiled in the last month or been happy when she had made progress in therapy. He had had his own battles with depression two years ago and had only come out of it with friends and professional help.

真嗣对这一切无言以对。他想到的任何回应都立刻被自己否决，因为他看到了这些话的空洞。他走到明日香身边，抓住她的肩膀，尽管她挣扎，还是把她拉了起来。当她坐直时，他紧紧抱住她，感觉到她在颤抖。他自己的泪水浸湿了给她买的蓝色 T 恤的肩部，而她的泪水则落在了他的手臂上。听了她的话，他意识到为什么她这一个月来没有笑过，也没有在治疗中取得进展时感到高兴。两年前他自己也与抑郁症斗争过，只有在朋友和专业帮助下才得以走出阴霾。

"You're not alone Asuka. And you are not useless or anything like that." But his comments didn't do anything as the silence stretched on.

"你并不孤单，Asuka。你不是没用的，也不是别的什么。" 但他的话并没有打破沉默，沉默依旧持续着。

Her voice was barely above a whisper. "Why doesn't Misato visit me more? Where has Hikari been?"

她的声音几乎只是耳语。"为什么 Misato 不常来看我？Hikari 去哪儿了？"

"Misato's the Sub-Commander of NERV now and has a lot of meetings to attend." Shinji tried to move one hand but Asuka's grip tightened. "She cares about you a lot, and worries about you everyday. Just like me."

如今，美里是 NERV 的副指挥官，有很多会议要参加。" 真嗣试图移动一只手，但明日香的握力更紧了。"她非常关心你，每天都为你担心。就像我一样。

Asuka trembled as he finally freed one hand and placed it on her cheek. "And what about Hikari? Why hasn't she come to visit or called me?"

他终于挣脱一只手，放在她的脸颊上，明日香颤抖着。"那日向呢？为什么她没来看我，也没给我打电话？"

"She's studying abroad right now. I've emailed her and told her about you." He smiled as he remembered her reply. "Hikari said she'll try and come back when you start school next month."

她现在正在国外学习。我已经给她发了邮件，告诉她关于你的事。" 他微笑着回忆起她的回复。"光说她会尽量在你下个月开学时回来。

At the comment about Hikari, Asuka felt herself grin as she envisioned what her reply must have been like. Her grin again faded, as she wondered why Hikari hadn't called. She wasn't going anywhere and normally had nothing to do so even if Hikari called in the middle of the night it wouldn't have been a problem. Didn't she care? And she didn't want to think about school with all the problems she’d have there. Turning her head, she saw Shinji watching her carefully.

听到关于光的话，明日香不由自主地笑了，想象着她的回复会是什么样子。她的笑容再次消失，疑惑为什么光没有打电话来。她并没有什么事情要做，通常也没什么安排，所以即使光在半夜打电话来也不会有什么问题。难道她不在乎吗？而且她不想去想学校的事情，那里有一堆问题等着她。转过头，她看到真嗣正仔细地观察着她。

Asuka shifted in his arms a little. "Can you let me go?"

明日香在他怀里稍微动了动。“你能放开我吗？”

"You won't sulk, will you?"

"No promises Shinji since I really don't have any reason to be happy."

“没有承诺，真嗣，因为我真的没有任何理由感到快乐。”

He followed her example and lay on his back. "You're alive and can start over. That's enough to be happy about."

他效仿她的样子，仰面躺下。“你还活着，可以重新开始。这足以让人感到幸福了。”

Two weeks later 两周后

Shinji walked through the halls of the high school, gliding smoothly between the packs of bodies, heading to his locker to get his shoes and jacket. He hid a yawn behind a raised hand, as he had not gotten enough sleep the night before. Asuka's words had kept rolling through his head and he had tried to come up with a way to cheer her up and to see her smile again. But he had come up with nothing that would work, a movie she would find dull, same with music or a book, and dinner was out. Shinji stopped suddenly at that last thought, causing a couple of students to bump into him.

真嗣漫步在高中走廊里，在人群中穿梭自如，前往自己的储物柜取鞋和夹克。他用手遮住了一个哈欠，因为前一晚没有睡够。明日香的话一直在他脑海中回响，他试图想出一个能让她开心、再次看到她笑容的办法。但他想不出任何有效的办法，电影她会觉得无聊，音乐和书籍也一样，晚餐也不行。真嗣突然停下脚步，这个念头让他愣住了，导致几个学生撞到了他。

"That might work." He whispered to himself while working out the idea.

"这或许可行。" 他一边琢磨这个主意，一边自言自语道。

"What might work, Shinji?" inquired a quiet voice next to him.

"什么可能有效呢，真嗣？" 一个安静的声音在他旁边问道。

Shinji jumped a little and turned to find Kensuke standing beside him. His friend had given up on the military and NERV once the truth of the Angels and SEELE had been released. But that hadn't dampened his desire to find out secrets, whether it was in school or out in the public. Shinji looked over his friend, trying to find the voice recorder he had switched over to after realizing the limitations of carrying around a video camera.

真嗣微微一惊，转头发现健介正站在他身旁。他的这位朋友在天使和 SEELE 的真相被揭露后，已经放弃了军事和 NERV。但这并没有减弱他探寻秘密的欲望，无论是在学校还是在外面的世界。真嗣打量着他的朋友，试图找到他自从意识到携带摄像机的局限性后改用的录音机。

Kensuke saw the untrusting glance and grinned as they started walking. "You don't have to worry. I don't have it on today." He leaned in close, whispering, "So what might work?"

健介看到那不信任的眼神，咧嘴一笑，随即他们开始走动。“你不必担心，我今天没带。”他凑近低语，“那你觉得什么可能有效？”

"I was just thinking how to…"

我刚在想怎么……

"How to avoid your group of admirers," interrupted Kensuke pointing at the locker area as they rounded a corner.

"如何避开你的仰慕者们，" 健介打断道，指向储物柜区域，他们正拐过一个角落。

"Damn!" cursed Shinji before grabbing Kensuke and pulling him back around the corner before the girls could see them. He glared as his friend chucked. "I need a favor."

该死！" 真嗣咒骂着，一把抓住健介，将他拽回角落，以免女孩们看见他们。他瞪着朋友咯咯笑的样子，说："我需要你帮个忙。

The young man nodded. "Okay." Kensuke paused. "On one condition."

年轻人点了点头。“好的。” 健介停顿了一下。“但有一个条件。”

Shinji felt his teeth grind together. "What is it?"

真嗣感到自己的牙齿紧紧咬合在一起。“怎么了？”

"Tell me what you were thinking about."

告诉我你在想什么。

"It’s a secret," Shinji stated.

"这是个秘密，" 碇真嗣说道。

"And?" Kensuke asked. "然后呢？" 健介问道。

"Meet me in the lunch area." Shinji waited for Kensuke to nod before slipping off his school shoes and exiting a nearby door. It wouldn’t be the first time he had ruined a pair of socks but it was better than having his time wasted.

"在午餐区见。" 真嗣等待健介点头后，才脱下校鞋，从附近的门溜了出去。这已经不是他第一次弄脏袜子了，但总比浪费时间好。

Kensuke watched his friend through the window as he walked towards the school grounds used for lunch, where friends met before and after school. Shrugging his shoulders, he turned and put on his best smile in order to deal with Shinji's admirers. He didn't understand why Shinji didn't just give one of them a yes and the others a no and just be done with it. None of the girls were ugly and all were quite smart but Shinji acted like he just didn't care about dating or having a girlfriend. Kensuke's grin grew as the girls frowned when he shouldered his way to Shinji's locker, after stopping at his own, and grabbed Shinji’s stuff. He walked to the exit, hearing the footsteps of the girls behind him as they followed. Kensuke sprinted when he reached the stairs and ran through the gate taking two quick right turns before seeing the dumpsters in front of him. Jumping onto one of the dumpsters, he vaulted the school wall before any of the girls had caught up to him. Smoothing his school uniform, he started looking for his friend after passing through the athletic grounds.

健介透过窗户看着他的朋友走向学校用于午餐的场地，那里是朋友们在上学前后聚集的地方。他耸了耸肩，转身露出最灿烂的笑容，以应对真嗣的仰慕者们。他不明白为什么真嗣不直接对其中一人说“是”，对其余的人说“不”，就此了结。这些女孩都不丑，而且都很聪明，但真嗣表现得好像对约会或交女朋友完全不感兴趣。当健介挤到真嗣的储物柜前，从自己的柜子停下后，抓起真嗣的东西时，女孩们皱起了眉头。他走向出口，听到身后女孩们的脚步声紧随其后。健介在到达楼梯时开始冲刺，穿过校门，迅速向右转了两次，然后看到了前面的垃圾箱。他跳上其中一个垃圾箱，翻越了学校围墙，此时女孩们还没追上他。整理了一下校服，他穿过运动场开始寻找他的朋友。

"Here." Shinji looked up to see his black windbreaker flying toward him along with his shoes. Quietly, Shinji slid a can of juice to Kensuke as he put on his shoes and jacket.

"这里。" 真嗣抬头看见他的黑色风衣和鞋子正朝他飞来。他默默地将一罐果汁滑给剑介，同时穿上鞋子和外套。

"This goes no further than you, okay,” said Shinji as he stood.

"这事只限于你我知道，好吗，” 真嗣站起来说道。

"Fine."

Shinji took a deep breath and slowly released it. "Asuka's awake."

真嗣深吸一口气，缓缓吐出。“明日香醒了。”

"ASUKA!" Kensuke yelled before Shinji slapped a hand over his mouth. He squirmed under his friend's grip but calmed down before Shinji released him. "Asuka, pilot of Unit-02, and bane of all boys, right?"

"明日香！" 健介大喊，随即被真嗣用手捂住了嘴。他在朋友的紧握下挣扎，但在真嗣放开他之前平静了下来。“明日香，二号机的驾驶员，也是所有男生的克星，对吧？”

"Yes!" hissed Shinji. "And keep it down."

是的！" 渚薰低声说道。"而且小声点。

"Awake, awake right? Not half way awake or pretending to be awake." Kensuke stepped back at Shinji's glare. "Sorry, but it's just unreal to hear that. It’s been two years since she…" Kensuke stopped unable to form the words. "That explains why you've been acting weird lately."

醒着，完全醒着对吧？不是半醒不醒，或者装作醒着。" 剑介在真嗣的瞪视下后退了一步。"抱歉，但这听起来太不真实了。自从她……" 剑介停了下来，无法说出那几个字。"这就解释了为什么你最近行为怪异。

"What do you mean?" demanded Shinji.

"你是什么意思？" 真嗣质问道。

"You've been happier a lot more, none of your usually gloominess."

你最近开心多了，一点也没有平时的忧郁。

"I've never been gloomy." was the indignant reply.

"我从未沮丧过。"这是愤慨的回答。

Kensuke laughed at the comment. "If you say so, but you’re happier and the girls have picked up on that." He thought a little on it. "Though they're not going to be happy to hear about Asuka."

健介对这番话笑了笑。"如果你这么说，但你确实更快乐了，女孩们也注意到了这一点。"他稍微想了想。"不过，她们听到明日香的事可能不会高兴。"

"I really don't care what they think about Asuka or me." Shinji sat down hard on the bench, crossing his arms in anger.

"我真的不在乎他们怎么看待明日香或我。" 真嗣重重地坐在长凳上，愤怒地交叉双臂。

"Well you should, especially considering that she rubbed a lot of people the wrong way and those people weren't exactly filled with sorrow at hearing what had happened to her." Kensuke finished his juice and threw the can in the garbage. "And your most devoted admirers are the ones that had the greatest hatred for Asuka."

你应该在乎，尤其是考虑到她得罪了不少人，那些人在听到她的遭遇时并没有感到悲伤。" 健介喝完果汁，将罐子扔进垃圾桶。"而你最忠实的崇拜者正是那些最憎恨明日香的人。

Shinji didn't say anything as they started back to the school and its exit. He knew there were a lot of people who had hated Asuka back in junior high, either because of her superior attitude directed at the girls or the scorn toward the boys. And in her current state, he doubted if Asuka was up to the task of defending herself from her enemies. Then again maybe it would be enough to rekindle the fire of two years ago. Shinji shook his head in anger, as he knew how unlikely that was to happen while Asuka was depressed. It could drive her further down or even make her retreat back into her shell.

真嗣没有说话，他们开始返回学校和出口。他知道有很多人在初中时就讨厌明日香，要么是因为她对女生的优越态度，要么是对男生的蔑视。而在她目前的状态下，他怀疑明日香是否有能力保护自己免受敌人的伤害。或许这足以重新点燃两年前的火焰。真嗣愤怒地摇了摇头，他知道在明日香抑郁的情况下，这种情况不太可能发生。这可能会让她更加消沉，甚至让她退缩回自己的壳里。

He turned at the punch to his shoulder. "What?"

他转身面对肩膀上的那一拳，"怎么了？"

"I asked how she is and you ignored me," Kensuke stated with a smile. "What else was I supposed to do?" His grin disappeared as he put on a serious face. "So how is she?"

我问她怎么样了，你却无视我，" 健介笑着说。"那我还能怎么办？" 他的笑容消失了，换上了一副严肃的面孔。"那她到底怎么样了？

"Not so good. She's only smiled once since waking up and her eyes look dead. Asuka feels empty and useless, just like I did." He paused frowning as his hands clenched. "But I feel, no, I know she's deeply depressed and there’s not a thing I can do about it."

不太好。她醒来后只笑过一次，眼神空洞。明日香感到空虚和无用，就像我当初一样。" 他停顿了一下，皱着眉头，双手紧握。"但我感觉，不，我知道她深陷抑郁，而我却无能为力。

"You are doing something by seeing her everyday. You're showing her that she isn't alone and that you're there for her." Kensuke grinned at a sudden thought. "Don't worry, I’m sure you’ve already told her how much you love her.” He glanced at Shinji. “Though I don’t see any scars so maybe…”

你每天见她，正是在做些什么。你在向她表明，她并不孤单，你始终在她身边。" 健介突然想到什么，咧嘴一笑，"别担心，我相信你已经告诉过她你有多爱她了。" 他瞥了一眼真嗣，"不过我没看到任何伤痕，或许……

"Kensuke!" Shinji felt his face heat up despite his outburst. He relaxed as his friend chuckled.

"健介！" 真嗣虽然大声喊出，但脸颊还是不由自主地发热。随着朋友的一阵轻笑，他放松了下来。

"Don't worry. I won't say a word." He paused at the corner where they normally split. "Though don't forget your other friends, okay."

别担心，我不会透露一个字的。"他在通常分开的拐角处停顿了一下，"不过别忘了你的其他朋友，好吗？

"Touji's been asking about me?" Shinji frowned at the nod. "I'm sorry but at the moment Asuka..."

东治一直在问我的事吗？"真嗣皱眉看着点头。"对不起，但目前来说，明日香……

"I said don't worry, and anyways Touji will understand."

我说了别担心，而且无论如何，图治会理解的。

Shinji looked off into the distance. "So when does he return?"

真嗣望向远方，问道：“那他什么时候回来？”

Before Kensuke could answer, Shinji's cell phone started ringing. Holding up a finger, Shinji pulled the phone out of his pocket and looked at the display. He frowned slightly as he read the number and tried to figure out what the caller would want. Sighing, he flipped it open and held it up to his ear.

在剑助回答之前，真嗣的手机开始响了起来。他竖起一根手指，从口袋里掏出手机，看了看显示屏。当他读到号码时，微微皱起了眉头，试图猜测来电者有何意图。叹了口气，他翻开手机，举到耳边。

"Hello Misato. How are you?"

“你好，美里。你怎么样？”

"I'm fine," she answered. "Look, Shinji, where are you?"

我很好，"她回答道，"看，真嗣，你在哪里？

"On my way back to the apartment. Is something wrong?"

在回公寓的路上。有什么问题吗？

"Nothing's wrong so don't worry." Shinji could clearly hear Misato draw a deep breath, and braced himself. "Were you going to see Asuka tonight?"

没什么问题，所以不用担心。" 真嗣清楚地听到美里深吸了一口气，他做好了准备。"你今晚是要去见明日香吗？

Shinji closed his eyes. "Yes."

真嗣闭上了眼睛。"是的。"

Her breath was slowly released. "I would take it as a personal favor if you stayed home instead."

她缓缓地吐出一口气。“如果你能留在家里，我会当作是帮了我一个忙。”

"Why?"

"I can't talk about it. Will you please stay home?" Her voice was calm, not commanding him, but asking.

“我不能谈论这件事。请你留在家里好吗？”她的声音很平静，不是命令他，而是在请求。

Shinji feared the worst. "What's wrong with Asuka?"

真嗣感到最坏的情况。“明日香怎么了？”

"Nothing."

"Then why do you want me to stay home?" He felt his anger rise as Misato continued to dodge his questions.

“那你为什么想让我呆在家里？” 当美里继续回避他的问题时，他感到自己的怒气上升。

"She's had a bad day and I feel she needs some time alone." Her voice finally shifted to a command. "So stay home, Shinji!"

她今天过得很糟糕，我觉得她需要一些独处的时间。"她的声音最终转为命令。"所以，真嗣，待在家里！

"But…"

Shinji stared angrily at his phone as Misato cut the connection. She had never been that short with him and he felt embarrassed for getting angry. Still, the request was not ordinary and that had sparked his interest. He decided he would still cook a dinner and take it to the hospital later that night. Sliding his phone back into his pocket, he turned on his heel and took a step only to bump into Kensuke.

真嗣愤怒地盯着手机，因为美里切断了连接。她从未对他如此简短，他为自己发怒感到尴尬。尽管如此，这个请求并不寻常，这激起了他的兴趣。他决定还是会做一顿晚餐，晚上再带到医院去。他把手机滑回口袋，转身迈步，却撞上了剑介。

"So are you going to obey Misato?"

那么，你打算听从葛城小姐的命令吗？

Shinji shook his head slowly. "No."

碇真嗣缓缓地摇了摇头。“不。”

"You're going to get into trouble for no reason, Shinji."

你无缘无故就会惹上麻烦，真嗣。

"Misato may be my commanding officer, my roommate and a friend, but she can't order me to stay away. This does not involve the EVAs, NERV or the United Nations. It's personal and she can't order me to stay home."

虽然美里是我的指挥官、室友和朋友，但她不能命令我远离。这和 EVA、NERV 或联合国无关。这是私事，她不能命令我待在家里。

"Asuka is still an EVA pilot, which puts her under NERV and the U.N." Kensuke stopped as Shinji shook his head. "What?"

明日香仍然是 EVA 驾驶员，这意味着她隶属于 NERV 和联合国。" 健介停了下来，因为真嗣摇了摇头。"怎么了？

"They haven't reactivated her, not until they see if she can pilot. So until that happens everything concerning her is personal."

他们还没有重新激活她，要等到确认她能否驾驶 EVA。所以在那之前，所有关于她的事务都是私人的。

Kensuke shook his head, unable to believe Shinji was that ignorant. "I still say you're wrong and it's your butt on the line, but I can see nothing is going to change your mind." Kensuke turned and started walking but stopped after a few steps. Looking over his shoulder he stared at Shinji. "Touji will be back on Thursday, just to let you know."

健介摇了摇头，无法相信真嗣竟如此无知。“我还是认为你错了，而且这是你自己的责任，但看来我无法改变你的想法。”健介转身开始走，但几步后又停了下来。他回头盯着真嗣说：“顺便告诉你，彻治周四会回来。”

"Thanks and I'll see you later." With that said, each young man went his own way thinking different things.

"谢谢，回头见。"说完这话，两位年轻人各自离去，心中所想各不相同。

Shinji shifted uncomfortably in his seat on the train as stares were directed at him from the other passengers. Curfew would be starting in a few minutes but he had his ID in his pocket and nothing to worry about. Still, he would feel nervous if he had to pull rank because he outranked virtually everybody in Tokyo-3, except for a small cadre of officers. He wanted no attention drawn to him or what he was doing out so late, and so he let out a sigh of relief as they finally entered the part of the city under control of NERV. As they passed through the guarded wall surrounding the base Shinji felt the tension slowly drain from his body. He was almost there. Small floodlights illuminated the hospital, which never left his view until they pulled into the station.

真嗣在火车座位上不安地挪动，因为其他乘客的目光都投向了他。宵禁即将开始，但他口袋里有身份证，无需担忧。尽管如此，如果因为他在第三新东京市几乎比所有人都高阶而不得不行使特权，他仍会感到紧张。他不希望自己的晚归行为引起任何注意，因此当他们最终进入 NERV 控制的城市区域时，他松了一口气。穿过环绕基地的警戒墙时，真嗣感到紧张感逐渐消散。他几乎到达目的地了。微弱的泛光灯照亮了医院，直到列车进站，那座医院始终未曾离开他的视线。

Standing up, Shinji grabbed the bundle he had brought with him from Misato's and exited the train. Ignoring the various entrances that led into the Geo-Front, Shinji headed for the automatic doors of the station and walked outside. A lake surrounded by buildings of various sizes greeted him but he ignored them as he headed for the water. Following the arc of the shore, Shinji knew he would be at the hospital soon and then Asuka. At those thoughts he felt his palms grow sweaty as he wondered what Misato would be like once she learned of his disobedience. He no longer felt so strong but he would not turn back and so he straightened up as he swiped his ID card to gain entrance.

起身，真嗣抓起从美里那里带来的包裹，走出了列车。他无视通往 Geo-Front 的各个入口，径直走向车站的自动门，步出站外。眼前是一片被大小不一的建筑环绕的湖泊，但他无心欣赏，直奔水边而去。沿着湖岸的弧线前行，真嗣知道医院就在不远处，而那里有明日香在等待。想到这些，他的手掌不由自主地渗出汗水，心中忐忑，不知美里得知他的违逆后会作何反应。尽管不再感到坚定，但他决意不回头，挺直腰杆，刷卡进入。

Minutes later his footsteps echoed off the dimly lit hallway walls as he turned down the proper corridor to Asuka's room. He nodded as he passed the nurses station and got a smile in return as they all knew him and had no orders to stop the boy. Shinji smiled faintly, hoping the meal would help Asuka, even if it were late at night. Though he knew it was a long shot, he still had to try. His nature wouldn't allow him to just stand meekly to the side anymore. His head turned automatically at the sound of a door opening and closing as he tried to see if someone was leaving Asuka's room. His heart calmed as he saw it was just someone exiting the restroom but then it raced as the person stepped into the light.

片刻后，他的脚步声在昏暗的走廊墙壁间回响，他拐进了通往明日香房间的正确走廊。经过护士站时，他点头致意，换来的是她们微笑的回应，因为大家都认识他，也没有命令阻止这个男孩。真嗣微微一笑，希望这顿饭能对明日香有所帮助，尽管已是深夜。虽然他知道希望渺茫，但仍需一试。他的本性不再允许他只是温顺地站在一旁。听到开门关门声，他的头本能地转过去，试图看看是否有人正离开明日香的房间。看到只是有人从洗手间出来，他的心稍稍平静，但当那人步入灯光下时，心跳又加速了。

Crimson eyes regarded him thoughtfully as Rei stopped and waited for him to catch up to her. Shinji swallowed nervously and looked at the second most important girl in his life, hoping that she wouldn't ask anything. His wish was granted as she took a quick glance at the package in his hands and smiled faintly. That smile was enough to make Shinji feel bad for giving Asuka all of his attention, yet Rei had never held it against him. She had told him in her own strange way that she knew who he had chosen and for what reasons. Despite her reassurances and explanations, Shinji felt he had betrayed Rei in some way, and yet their friendship had grown stronger over the last two years.

深红色的眼睛若有所思地注视着他，当丽停下来等他赶上时。真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫，看着他生命中第二重要的女孩，希望她不会问什么。他的愿望实现了，她快速瞥了一眼他手中的包裹，然后微微一笑。那个微笑足以让真嗣为将所有注意力都给了明日香而感到内疚，然而丽从未因此责怪过他。她以自己独特的方式告诉他，她知道他选择了谁以及为什么。尽管她的安慰和解释，真嗣觉得自己在某种程度上背叛了丽，但他们的友谊在过去两年中却变得更加牢固。

"Why are you disobeying Misato's orders?"

你为什么不服从美里小姐的命令？

Shinji removed his hand from the cool metal and turned to face Rei. Her gaze was one of puzzlement as she waited for his answer. "Because I had to, Rei, and you know that."

碇真嗣从冰冷的金属上移开手，转身面对绫波。她带着困惑的眼神等待着他的回答。“因为我必须这么做，绫波，你也知道的。”

"Orders are meant to be obeyed." Her voice never changed.

“命令就是用来服从的。”她的声音始终没有变化。

"I have to see Asuka." Shinji grabbed the knob and started turning, putting Rei's statement out of his mind.

"我必须见见明日香。" 碇真嗣抓住门把手开始转动，将绫波的陈述抛诸脑后。

"The order was meant to protect you as much as Asuka."

这个命令是为了保护你，就像保护明日香一样。

Shinji spun around and faced Rei. "What is that supposed to mean? What has Asuka gone through today?"

真嗣转身面对绫波，问道：“那是什么意思？明日香今天经历了什么？”

Rei averted her eyes, not wanting to look at his gaze. "I can not tell you Shinji."

绫波避开他的目光，不愿直视。“我不能告诉你，真嗣。”

"Damn it Rei! We're friends aren't we?" Shinji closed his eyes, getting a hold of his anger. "Asuka's important to me, you know that. Please…tell me."

该死，绫波！我们是朋友，对吧？" 真嗣闭上眼睛，控制住自己的怒气。"你知道的，明日香对我很重要。拜托……告诉我吧。

Rei stood silently with her arms crossed, contemplating Shinji's request. Her friendship with Shinji was very important to her and she didn't want to damage or lose it. On the other hand, Rei felt that Misato was only trying to protect her children from pain and she had to help as much as possible. She also knew that orders were meant to be obeyed, even if the recipient didn't know why they were given. But as she stared into Shinji's dark blue eyes she decided her friendship with Shinji was more important than following orders.

绫波静静地站着，双臂交叉，思考着真嗣的请求。她与真嗣的友谊对她来说非常重要，她不想破坏或失去它。另一方面，绫波觉得美里只是想保护她的孩子们免受痛苦，她必须尽可能地帮助。她也知道命令就是用来服从的，即使接受者不知道为什么要给出这些命令。但当她凝视着真嗣深蓝色的眼睛时，她决定与真嗣的友谊比服从命令更重要。

"Asuka had her first session with her psychologist. They talked about her past. It has also been found necessary for her to go to counseling to deal with the rape by the 15th." Rei stepped closer to Shinji and stared hard into his eyes. "Misato judged that Asuka would be disturbed by talking about those things and felt she might lash out at you."

明日香与心理医生进行了首次会谈，他们讨论了她的过去。同时，也发现有必要让她接受咨询，以应对第 15 次发生的强奸事件。" 绫波丽走近真嗣，目光坚定地盯着他的眼睛。"美里判断，谈论这些事情会让明日香感到不安，她可能会因此对你发泄情绪。

"God," muttered Shinji as he leaned back against the door. "How could Misato think that being alone would help Asuka? At a time like this Asuka needs as many people around her as possible for support." His voice was climbing in volume and speeding up as he tried to comprehend Misato. "Doesn't she realize that Asuka is extremely depressed! Hell even I can see that!"

天哪，" 真嗣背靠着门喃喃自语，"美里怎么会认为独处能帮助明日香呢？在这种时候，明日香需要尽可能多的人围绕在她身边给予支持。" 他的声音随着对美里的不解而提高，语速加快。"难道她不明白明日香现在极度抑郁吗！连我都能看出来！

"Yes, but…"

"Misato is not a psychologist, Rei, so she does not know what is best for Asuka." With that Shinji turned around and grabbed the knob, twisting it.

碇真嗣说：“葛城并不是心理学家，绫波，所以她不知道什么对明日香最好。”说完，他转身抓住门把手，扭动它。

Again Rei's voice stopped him. "Be careful Shinji. Too much help can be as destructive as too little."

绫波的声音再次阻止了他。“小心点，真嗣。过多的帮助可能和过少一样具有破坏性。”

Shinji nodded at Rei's words but still pushed the door open. Slipping into the room, he closed the door behind him, leaving Rei out in the hallway and let his eyes adjust to the dim light. He frowned as he approached the bed as the covers were a jumbled mess and saw that Asuka was not lying there. Setting down the bundle, he turned to the source of light, which was coming from underneath the bathroom door. Swallowing, he approached the door trying to shove the dread from his mind as it conjured up different visions of what he might find. Shinji remembered the report about Asuka being found in a bathtub with her wrist slit before the 17th Angel had shown up.

真嗣对绫波的话点了点头，但还是推开了门。他溜进房间，关上门，把绫波留在了走廊里，让眼睛适应昏暗的光线。他皱着眉头走向床边，发现被子凌乱不堪，而明日香并不在那里。放下手中的东西，他转向光源，那是从浴室门下透出来的光。他咽了口唾沫，走向那扇门，试图将心中的恐惧推开，脑海中浮现出各种可能的景象。真嗣想起了关于明日香在第 17 使徒出现前被发现手腕割伤躺在浴缸里的报告。

"She wouldn't do that again," whispered Shinji, trying to reassure himself.

"她不会再那样做了，" 真嗣低声自言自语，试图安慰自己。

Stopping at the door, he reached for the handle but stopped himself. It would not do for him to open the door only to find that nothing was wrong and embarrass Asuka and himself. With his hand still on the handle, he placed his ear against the door and knocked, waiting for a reply or noise. But he heard nothing and as the silence stretched on, his nervousness grew. Knocking again, but this time harder, resulted in the same lack of response from the girl. Closing his eyes, Shinji took a deep breath and steeled himself before flinging open the door.

他停在门前，伸手去抓门把手却又停住了。如果他开门后发现什么问题都没有，只会让明日香和自己尴尬。手还放在把手上，他把耳朵贴在门上敲了敲，等待回应或声响。然而，他什么也没听到，随着沉默的延续，他的紧张感愈发强烈。再次敲门，这次更用力，依然没有女孩的回应。闭上眼睛，真嗣深吸一口气，鼓起勇气猛地推开门。

The sound of water lapping against the sides of the tub reached his ears and Shinji felt his face heat up. He had caught Asuka taking a bath and she had more than likely been resting and had not heard his knocking. Yet nothing happened as he stood there with his eyes closed, waiting for an indignant response. Slowly he opened his eyes to the scene in front of him.

水拍打浴缸边缘的声音传入他的耳中，真嗣感到脸颊发热。他撞见了正在洗澡的明日香，她很可能是在休息，没听见他的敲门声。然而，他站在那里闭着眼睛等待愤怒的回应，却什么也没发生。他缓缓睁开眼睛，眼前的景象映入眼帘。

"Oh, Asuka," whispered Shinji as tears came to his eyes.

"哦，明日香，" 真嗣低声说道，泪水涌上眼眶。

The redhead was in the tub with her face buried in her knees and arms wrapped around her legs. As he watched, her wet pale shoulders shook and her body trembled as she cried. Kneeling down next to the tub, Shinji reached out for her but stopped as his mind raged. One part argued that since Asuka was nude, he had no right to touch her while the other side pointed out that she needed comforting, regardless of her current condition. Reaching out, Shinji placed one hand on her back and the other on her knee and drew her as close as possible. But even his touch didn't elicit a response from Asuka, and Shinji frowned wondering what to do.

红发少女蜷缩在浴缸中，脸埋在膝盖间，双臂紧紧环抱双腿。他看着她，湿漉漉的苍白肩膀颤抖着，身体因哭泣而颤动。真嗣跪在浴缸旁，伸出手想要触碰她，却又停住了，内心激烈斗争。一方面认为明日香赤身裸体，自己无权触碰；另一方面又觉得她需要安慰，无论她现在是什么状态。他伸出手，一手放在她背上，另一手放在她膝盖上，尽可能地将她拉近。然而，即使他的触碰也未能引起明日香的任何反应，真嗣皱起眉头，思索着该如何是好。

Releasing her, Shinji went to the end of the tub and reached in to pop the plug, only to draw his hand back out. The water was barely lukewarm. Looking around the room, Shinji saw Asuka's clothes were in a pile and that the mirror had been fogged over. His anger rose at this conclusion. More than likely she had started out in a hot bath but as her demons attacked, she had assumed the position he found her in and the water had cooled. What made him angry was that Asuka had been in the water long enough for it to cool and yet no one had come to check on her. He plunged his hand back in and popped the plug trying not to curse. If Misato hadn't told him to stay home, which had resulted in him coming late, Asuka wouldn't be in this situation.

松开手，真嗣走到浴缸尽头，伸手去拔塞子，却又缩了回来。水只是微温。环顾四周，他发现明日香的衣物堆成一团，镜子也被雾气笼罩。得出这个结论，他的怒火升腾。很可能她起初泡在热水中，但随着心魔来袭，她蜷缩成他发现时的姿势，水温便降了下来。令他愤怒的是，明日香在水中待得够久，以至于水都凉了，却无人来查看。他再次伸手进去，拔掉塞子，尽力不让自己咒骂。若非美里让他留在家中，导致他晚到，明日香也不会陷入这般境地。

As the water drained, Shinji moved next to Asuka and squatted down, reaching underneath her. Grunting, Shinji slowly picked her up in his arms but as he straightened, Asuka's wet body threatened to slip from his arms. Glancing down to see her face, Shinji instead caught a full view her breasts. Sitting down on the edge of the tub as his face turned red from embarrassment, Shinji lifted his gaze. Asuka looked blankly at him through puffy eyes as he placed her feet on the ground. Shinji wrapped his arms around her midsection, holding her in his lap, and was careful to keep his hands away from her breasts or wandering lower.

随着水流排干，真嗣移动到明日香旁边蹲下，伸手到她身下。他哼了一声，慢慢地用双臂将她抱起，但当他站直时，明日香湿漉漉的身体差点从他怀里滑落。低头想看她的脸，真嗣却意外地看到了她的胸部。他红着脸坐在浴缸边上，抬起视线。明日香透过肿胀的眼睛茫然地看着他，他将她的脚放在地上。真嗣用双臂环抱住她的腰，让她坐在自己腿上，小心翼翼地避免手触碰到她的胸部或往下游走。

"Shinji." Her voice was full of pain and sorrow as she reached for his hands. "Where were you?"

真嗣。" 她的声音充满了痛苦和悲伤，她伸手去抓他的手。"你去了哪里？

"I'm sorry for not being here." He whispered, not telling her about Misato's orders. "Can you stand?"

我很抱歉没能在这里。" 他低声说道，没有告诉她关于碇真嗣的命令。"你能站起来吗？

The girl nodded her head before standing on shaky legs, and allowing Shinji to get off the edge of the tub. Glancing down at his wet clothes, Shinji shook his head, though he really didn't care about himself at the moment. Looking over, Shinji saw Asuka standing there, not even trying to cover herself. Turning away, Shinji spied a towel hanging on the back of the door and moved for it. Before he could reach it two arms wrapped around him and squeezed hard, pulling him backwards.

女孩点了点头，然后摇摇晃晃地站了起来，让真嗣从浴缸边缘下来。真嗣低头看了看自己湿漉漉的衣服，摇了摇头，尽管此刻他并不在乎自己。转头一看，真嗣发现明日香站在那里，甚至没有试图遮掩自己。他转过身去，看到门后挂着一条毛巾，便向它走去。就在他伸手去拿之前，两条手臂紧紧地抱住了他，用力将他向后拉。

"Oh God, I just wanted to forget," Asuka cried against his back. "I just wanted to forget everything that happened to me but I can't."

哦，上帝，我只是想忘记，" 明日香伏在他的背上哭泣。"我只是想忘记发生在我身上的一切，但我做不到。

Slowly, Shinji turned around in Asuka's arms and followed her example as he held the trembling girl close. As he stroked her back he felt the hot force of her breasts against his chest. Trying to ignore the feeling she was causing, he held her head as she cried against his shoulder. Shinji could smell Asuka's enticing scent and feel all of her as she leaned against his body for support, and it didn't upset him. All that mattered was for him to be there and hope that Asuka would dig herself out of the hole she had placed herself in. Backing up slowly, so he didn't have to let go of the frightened girl, Shinji exited the bathroom.

慢慢地，真嗣在明日香的怀抱中转过身来，模仿她的动作，紧紧抱住颤抖的女孩。当他抚摸她的背时，他感觉到她胸部的热力紧贴着他的胸膛。试图忽略她引起的这种感觉，他托着她的头，让她靠在他的肩膀上哭泣。真嗣能闻到明日香诱人的香气，感受到她全身倚靠在他身上寻求支持，这并没有让他感到不安。最重要的是他在那里，希望明日香能从自己挖的坑里爬出来。他慢慢地后退，这样就不必放开这个受惊的女孩，真嗣离开了浴室。

With each step, he moved closer to the bed and stopped when it bumped against the back of his knees. Asuka didn't notice as she was still sobbing and talking about her past, her feelings, and what had happened in the psychologist’s office. Unwilling to let her go, Shinji moved to the side of the bed and, blushing, moved his hands to grip Asuka's waist. As he fell onto the mattress he felt Asuka’s body tense at the unexpected impact and her arms squeezed tighter. Shinji gasped in pain as Asuka landed on top of a sensitive and hard part of his body. Reaching up, he brushed some auburn hair off her cheek to see her eyes twinkling and a smile on her face.

每走一步，他都更靠近床边，直到膝盖碰到床沿才停下。明日香并未察觉，因为她仍在哭泣，诉说着她的过去、她的感受以及在心理医生办公室发生的事情。不愿放开她，真嗣挪到床边，脸红着，双手握住明日香的腰。当他倒在床垫上时，感觉到明日香因这突如其来的撞击而身体一紧，她的手臂也抱得更紧了。真嗣因明日香压在他身体敏感而坚硬的部分上而痛得倒吸一口气。他伸手拂去她脸颊上的一些赤褐色头发，看到她的眼睛闪烁着光芒，脸上带着微笑。

"Well I got you to smile again but not the way I originally wanted to," whispered Shinji as he continued to stroke Asuka's moist hair.

"好吧，我又让你笑了，但不是我原本想要的方式，"真嗣轻声说道，同时继续抚摸着明日香湿润的头发。

Asuka buried her face in his shoulder, muffling her voice. "I'm sorry, Shinji."

明日香将脸埋在他的肩上，声音变得含糊：“对不起，真嗣。”

"For what?"

"I've been using you since I woke up. Every time I want to stop, you're there for me." Her voice cracked a little. "It isn't fair for me to put my troubles on you, especially with how I treated you in the past."

“自从我醒来后，我就一直在利用你。每次我想停下来，你都在那里支持我。”她的声音有些哽咽，“把我的烦恼强加给你，尤其是考虑到我过去对你的态度，这对我来说太不公平了。”

"I don't care about what happened between us in the past, Asuka." Shinji looked up at the ceiling, Hyuga's words drifting through his head. "You had your reasons for acting a certain way back then."

我不在乎我们之间过去发生了什么，明日香。" 真嗣抬头望向天花板，日向的话在他脑海中回响。"你当时那样做，肯定有你的理由。

Asuka looked up at him, tears in her eyes. "What about..."

明日香抬头看着他，眼中含着泪水。"那...怎么办..."

"Forget about it, that was then, this is now." Shinji ran his fingers along Asuka's ribs, tickling her and getting her to laugh. "I was using you back then too, but I've changed. I promised myself that I would never use you again, and that no matter what happened between us I would always be there for you."

忘了那一切吧，那时是那时，现在是现在。" 真嗣用手指沿着明日香的肋骨滑动，逗得她咯咯笑。"那时我也利用了你，但我已经改变了。我向自己承诺，再也不会利用你，无论我们之间发生什么，我都会一直陪伴在你身边。

Shinji tried to ignore the sensations going through his body as Asuka shifted on top of him. He realized that he needed to get out from underneath her before anybody walked in. But when he tried to move, the redhead wrapped her bare legs around his and tightened her hold on his torso with her arms. Her cheek brushed his as she laid her head down, causing the young man to blush even more at the little touch. Mentally sighing, he reached for the covers and pulled them over the two of them, before returning his hands to Asuka's back.

真嗣试图忽略身体上的感觉，因为明日香正坐在他身上。他意识到需要在她进来之前离开。但当他试图移动时，红发女孩用她赤裸的双腿缠住他的腿，并用双臂紧紧抱住他的躯干。她的脸颊轻触他的脸颊，当她把头放下时，年轻人因为这小小的触碰而脸红得更厉害了。他心里叹了口气，伸手拉过被子盖在两人身上，然后把手放回明日香的背上。

'How do I get myself into these situations?’ thought Shinji, as he stared up at the ceiling wondering if he would be able to sleep at all. His crotch still ached from where she had hit, but that wasn’t what would keep him awake.

'我怎么总是陷入这种境地？’ 真嗣想着，抬头望着天花板，不知道自己是否能入睡。他的胯部仍因她那一击而隐隐作痛，但这并不是让他失眠的原因。

- - -

Next morning 第二天早上

Normally Shinji didn't awake confused, as there was typically nothing to confuse him. He had memorized his bed and bedroom over the three years that he had lived with Misato. He knew what he felt like after a good night's sleep and a bad night’s sleep. All he knew was that his body was one big cramp, and he had a massive headache from not getting enough sleep. As his body slowly awoke, he realized that something warm was lying up against him in a nice kind of way. Shinji also noticed his left hand was holding something warm and soft.

通常情况下，真嗣醒来时并不会感到困惑，因为没有什么能让他感到困惑。在与美里同住三年间，他已经熟悉了自己的床和卧室。他清楚自己睡得好与不好时的感觉。他只知道自己的身体像是一团紧绷的肌肉，由于睡眠不足而头痛欲裂。随着身体逐渐苏醒，他意识到有个温暖的东西正以一种舒适的方式紧贴着他。真嗣还注意到自己的左手正握着某个温暖而柔软的东西。

"Shinji." His eyes flew open at the sound of Asuka's voice saying his name as memories flooded his mind. He had been unable to get to sleep because each time he tried to move from underneath Asuka, she had moved with him no matter how many times he shifted. He had only fallen asleep from fatigue and, guessing from the way his body felt, that had only happened a couple hours ago.

"真嗣。" 听到明日香的声音叫出他的名字，他的眼睛猛地睁开，记忆涌入脑海。他无法入睡，因为每当他试图从明日香身下挪开时，她总是随着他移动，无论他变换多少次姿势。他只是因为疲惫才睡着，而且从身体的感觉来看，那似乎只发生在几个小时前。

Looking down, he saw Asuka staring back with wide eyes as she woke up. It was her nude body that was pressed up against him, and she had her arms around his shoulders, keeping him close. He shifted against her as his body reacted to her heat and touch, just like the night before, as his eyes traveled lower. The sheets were wrapped around her slim legs while her upper body was bare, a very arousing view. As Shinji looked at Asuka he finally saw what his hand was resting on and all happy thoughts disappeared. His arm was draped over her side while his hand rested on her butt. He quickly removed the hand and tried to back away but Asuka tightened her hold on him.

低头一看，他发现明日香正睁大眼睛回望着他，她醒了。是她赤裸的身体紧贴着他，双臂环抱在他的肩上，将他紧紧拥住。他身体一动，对她的体温和触感产生了反应，就像前一晚一样，目光不由自主地向下游移。床单缠绕在她纤细的双腿上，上身裸露，这景象十分撩人。当真嗣注视着明日香时，他终于意识到自己的手放在了哪里，所有愉悦的念头瞬间消失。他的手臂搭在她的腰侧，手掌正放在她的臀部上。他急忙移开手，试图后退，但明日香却收紧了拥抱。

"Asuka, I’m sorry," he apologized.

"明日香，对不起，"他道歉道。

"What for?" Though her own face was red, the girl was oddly calm.

"为什么呢？"尽管她自己的脸也红了，但女孩却出奇地平静。

"I touched you when I shouldn't have."

我不该碰你的。

"Did you do it on purpose?" inquired Asuka and smiled when he shook his head. "Then there was nothing improper about it.

你是故意的吗？" 明日香问道，并在他摇头时露出了微笑。"那么，这并没有什么不妥。

As Shinji stared up at the ceiling, Asuka rolled onto him, resting her chin on his shoulder. Neither spoke as they mulled over what had just happened. He still felt that he had touched her improperly and his erection certainly wasn’t helping matters. Sure, he knew she was a very beautiful young lady but he had always thought of her as a person, never as an object. Shinji shifted under the girl, feeling his entire body heat up, as his brain created images of him and Asuka in compromising positions.

当真嗣凝视着天花板时，明日香翻身压在他身上，下巴搁在他的肩头。两人都沉默不语，各自思索着刚刚发生的一切。他仍觉得自己触碰她时失了分寸，而此刻的勃起无疑让情况更加尴尬。诚然，他知道明日香是个非常美丽的少女，但他始终将她视作一个活生生的人，而非一件物品。真嗣在女孩身下挪动，感到全身发热，脑海中不由自主地浮现出与明日香陷入窘境的画面。

Meanwhile, Asuka was studying his face, trying to figure out what he was thinking about, but she drew a blank. That was, until his face turned red and his eyes wandered lower. Pushing herself against his chest, she made sure that all he could see was her face. After all, him touching her last night was one thing, but him staring at her now was entirely different. She felt her own face heat up as she finally reacted to the signals her body was sending her brain. The sensations of her bare legs rubbing against his and the press of his erection against her inner thigh, not to mention her breasts lying against Shinji's chest, were making her feel strange emotions while her body got warmer. Asuka pushed off of Shinji, stood up, and wrapped a sheet around her body.

与此同时，明日香正凝视着他的脸，试图揣摩他的心思，却一无所获。直到他的脸颊泛红，目光下移，她才恍然大悟。她紧贴他的胸膛，确保他只能看到她的脸。毕竟，他昨晚触碰她是一回事，而现在他这样盯着她看，完全是另一回事。她感到自己的脸颊也跟着发烫，终于对身体的信号做出了反应。她裸露的双腿与他的摩擦，他下体的勃起紧贴她的大腿内侧，还有她的胸部紧贴着真嗣的胸膛，这一切都在她体内激起了奇异的情感，让她感到身体越来越热。明日香从真嗣身上抽身，站了起来，用床单裹住了自己。

"I think I should get going," volunteered Shinji, standing up.

"我想我该走了，"真嗣主动站起来说道。

"Yep," agreed Asuka. "And I need to take a cold shower.

是的，" 阿苏卡同意道。"我需要洗个冷水澡。

Shinji felt arms go around him in a quick hug.

真嗣感觉到有人迅速拥抱了他一下。

"Thanks for last night." 谢谢你昨晚的帮助。

Mid-March 2018

Sunlight flooded the room through the large glass windows, reflecting off of various surfaces, and filling the room with warmth. The peacefulness of the moment was disrupted when Asuka walked through the light and made her way to the balcony. A steady breeze was blowing and turning her hair from a brushed silkiness to chaos. Her short skirt was blown around, brushing against long legs. Yet all Asuka did was to move her hair out of her face with practiced ease and walk over to the corner of the balcony. A small smile graced her face as she was slowly relearning that little action. The smile disappeared, as she knew she had a long ways to go still.

阳光透过宽大的玻璃窗洒满房间，在各种表面上反射，为室内带来温暖。这一刻的宁静被阿苏卡穿过光线走向阳台的脚步打破。一阵稳定的微风吹过，将她的秀发从柔顺的丝绸变为凌乱。她的短裙随风飘动，轻拂着修长的双腿。然而，阿苏卡只是熟练地将头发从脸上拨开，走向阳台的一角。她脸上渐渐浮现出一丝微笑，仿佛在慢慢重新学会这个小动作。但微笑随即消失，因为她知道自己还有很长的路要走。

She turned at the sound of the balcony door opening, allowing Misato to step through before closing the door behind her. Asuka watched quietly as the older woman walked the short distance to her and leaned against the railing. Violet and auburn hair blew in the wind as the two females looked at each other without saying a word. So much had happened between the two of them in the past, some of it had been childish and their relationship had been damaged. Asuka opened her mouth to speak but Misato beat her to the punch.

她听到阳台门打开的声音转过身，让美里走进来，然后关上门。明日香静静地看着这位年长的女士走过来，靠在栏杆上。紫罗兰色和赤褐色的头发在风中飘扬，两位女性彼此对视，一言不发。过去她们之间发生了太多事情，有些是幼稚的，她们的关系也因此受损。明日香张口欲言，但美里抢先一步。

"You don't have to apologize for anything, Asuka. I'm just glad you're back."

你不必为任何事道歉，明日香。我很高兴你回来了。

Asuka shook her head angrily. "No, I have to say this Misato. I have to say that I'm sorry." She looked down for a moment before making eye contact with Misato. "I'm sorry, Misato, for how I treated you back then and I'm sorry that it took this long..."

明日香愤怒地摇了摇头。“不，我必须说出来，美里。我必须说我为那时对你的态度道歉。”她低头片刻后，与美里对视。“对不起，美里，为我当时那样对你，也为过了这么久才……”

Her apology was interrupted as Misato hugged her tightly. After a few awkward seconds Asuka hugged the woman back. She flinched when Misato stroked her back like Shinji had done so many times in the last months. Asuka wiped at her nose when they separated a few minutes later, causing Misato to smile faintly. She took the offered tissue with a small grin and blew her nose.

她的道歉被中断，因为碇真嗣紧紧地抱住了她。几秒钟尴尬的沉默后，明日香也回抱了这位女士。当碇真嗣像过去几个月里无数次那样抚摸她的背时，她不禁一缩。几分钟后，当他们分开时，明日香擦了擦鼻子，这让碇真嗣微微一笑。她带着一丝微笑接过递来的纸巾，擤了擤鼻子。

"Now you see what happens when you let your anger control you." Misato said as she went back to the railing.

"现在你看到了，当你让愤怒控制你时会发生什么。" 碇真嗣边说边回到栏杆旁。

"I know, but back then it was all that kept me going," whispered Asuka.

"我知道，但那时候，愤怒是我唯一坚持下去的动力，" 明日香低声说道。

Misato nodded, "What drives you now?"

碇真嗣点了点头，“你现在是什么驱使着你？”

"I don't know. At times I feel like a machine and others a hollow shell." Asuka admitted after thinking about her answer.

“我不知道。有时候我觉得自己像台机器，有时候又觉得自己像个空壳。”明日香在思考了一会儿后承认道。

"I hope you find out soon." Misato turned back to the door. "Come on. I'll drive Shinji and you to school."

我希望你很快能弄清楚。" 碇真嗣转回身去面对门。"来吧，我开车送你和真嗣去学校。

"We're going to walk, okay?"

我们走路去，好吗？

"Fine." Misato turned back to Asuka. "Speaking of Shinji, have you apologized to him?"

好的。" 碇真嗣转而面向明日香。"说到碇真嗣，你向他道歉了吗？

"We've reached an understanding." Asuka felt her face heat up. "No bringing up the past or apologizing for what happened between us during the Angels.”

"我们达成了共识。" 明日香感到自己的脸颊发热。"不要提起过去，也不要为我们在面对使徒时发生的事情道歉。”

Misato nodded and motioned for Asuka to go first back into the apartment. As the girl passed her, she leaned in close. "Shinji really has matured physically, hasn't he? I hear the girls think he's quite the find, tall, handsome, and muscled. Not to mention how his butt and eyes draw you in."

美里点头示意明日香先回公寓。当女孩从她身边经过时，她凑近了些。"真嗣真的在身体上成熟了很多，不是吗？我听说女生们都觉得他是个不错的对象，高大、英俊、肌肉发达。更别提他的臀部和眼睛有多吸引人了。"

"MISATO!" This time Asuka felt her whole body heat up. "How...how could you say such a thing?"

MISATO!" 这次，明日香感到全身都热了起来。"你...你怎么能说出这种话？

"What? It’s true." She stared at Asuka, puzzled. "Don't tell me…"

什么？这是真的。" 她困惑地盯着明日香。"别告诉我……

Asuka was half listening to Misato as she watched the young man they were talking about go about his business in the apartment. She had noticed the changes in Shinji, but had shoved them out of her mind. Their relationship was slowly mending and she didn't want to destroy the trust by thinking of him as an object. Especially since she knew that Shinji never viewed her as an object even after that night they had slept together. It also wouldn't be fair to Shinji when she didn't even know what she wanted to do with her life anymore.

明日香一边听着美里说话，一边观察着他们谈论的那个年轻人在公寓里的活动。她注意到了真嗣的变化，但把这些念头抛到了脑后。他们的关系正在慢慢修复，她不想通过把他视为物品来破坏信任。尤其是她知道，即使在那晚他们一起睡过之后，真嗣也从未将她视为物品。当她甚至不知道自己想如何安排生活时，这对真嗣也不公平。

"I've noticed." She murmured.

“我注意到了。”她低声说。

"Good, but what are you going to do about it."

好，但对此你打算怎么办呢？

"Nothing. I have to get my life in order first."

什么也不做。我得先把自己的生活理顺。

With that, Asuka stepped away from Misato and strode up to Shinji who was coming out of the kitchen. From the time they had spent together at the hospital Asuka knew that Shinji had not changed much and was still a caring person. It was with that thought in mind that she took her school bag from his hand with a smile, knowing that he would have made sure everything was in order, even after she had double checked it herself. Turning around, she waved goodbye to Misato and stepped through the door after Shinji.

就这样，明日香离开美里，走向刚从厨房出来的真嗣。在医院共度的时光里，明日香知道真嗣并没有太大变化，依旧是个体贴的人。她带着这样的想法，微笑着从他手中接过书包，心知他一定已经确保一切妥当，尽管她自己已经再次检查过。转身后，她向美里挥手告别，跟在真嗣后面走出了门。

- - - -

"Umm, Asuka?"

Asuka lifted her gaze from the ground as she walked to stare at Shinji. It was the first thing he had said that morning since asking her if she was okay going back to school. Well maybe not the first, but they had barely spoken during the walk, though that was her fault. She had been slowly preparing herself for anything that would come from the students, from hatred to snide comments to being shunned. Asuka knew how her old self would have reacted, but that Asuka had been buried. Pushing those thoughts from her mind, she waited for Shinji as they stopped outside the gates of the school.

明日香一边走一边抬起目光望向真嗣。那是他那天早上除了问她是否准备好回学校之外说的第一句话。也许不是第一句，但他们在走路时几乎没怎么交谈，尽管那是她的错。她一直在慢慢为自己可能从学生们那里遇到的任何反应做准备，从仇恨到尖刻的评论，再到被排斥。明日香知道过去的自己会如何反应，但那个明日香已经被埋葬了。她将这些念头抛诸脑后，与真嗣一起在学校大门外停下脚步等待。

"What?" She was amazed that her voice wasn't dead sounding, though it wasn't exactly full of emotion either.

"什么？" 她惊讶地发现自己的声音并未显得沉闷，尽管也并非饱含情感。

Shinji wouldn't meet her eyes for a couple seconds but when he finally did, they were calm. "I want to say that I'm sorry."

真嗣起初几秒不愿与她对视，但当他终于看向她时，眼神平静。“我想说我为之前的事道歉。”

"For what?"

"That incident in the hospital a couple weeks ago." He nervously tugged at his collar. "I didn't mean to touch you."

几周前医院里的那件事。"他紧张地拉了拉衣领。"我不是故意要碰你的。

"I told you before that I knew it was an accident Shinji." She reached forward and pulled open the gate. "There’s nothing to be sorry about, and you don’t have to keep apologizing."

我之前就告诉过你，我知道那是意外，真嗣。"她伸手推开大门。"没什么好道歉的，你也不必一直道歉。

"I just wanted to make sure there were no problems between us before school."

我只是想确保我们上学前没有矛盾。

Asuka nodded before stepping up to the small station located immediately within the walls. Reaching into her bag, the redhead pulled out a manila envelope that Misato had given her the night before. Inside were all the forms necessary for her to get back into school life. She didn't have to wait long as the staff member in the booth looked over the first sheet, which explained that Asuka and Shinji had permission to come to school late that day. Without saying a word the man simply stamped the form and let the two of them go.

明日香点头后，走向紧靠围墙内的小站台。她从包里掏出一个昨晚美里给她的牛皮纸信封，里面装着所有重返校园生活所需的表格。她没等多久，窗口的工作人员查看第一页后，上面说明明日香和真嗣当天可以晚些到校。那人一言不发，只是盖了个章便放他们进去了。

"Let's go Asuka," she whispered to herself as they walked into the three-story building.

"我们走吧，明日香。" 她自言自语道，两人走进了那座三层楼的建筑。

- - - -

The clock was taking immense pleasure in torturing her as it slowly advanced to the end of the school day. Earlier she had been grateful that Misato had pulled some strings to get her into the same class as Shinji, even if the older woman had said that it was for personal and psychological reasons, and the U.N. deemed it necessary. Now the redhead was not so grateful as she looked down, sighing, as her computer signaled that another message had been received. She had been receiving them throughout the afternoon as the shock of her return slowly wore off. Most of the messages had been comments mocking her while others were from guys who wanted a date. Only four messages had been sent welcoming her back, though she expected them except the one from Rei.

时钟似乎在享受着折磨她的乐趣，随着时间缓缓逼近放学时刻。早先她曾感激美里动用关系让她和真嗣同班，尽管那位年长女性声称这是出于个人和心理原因，且联合国也认为这是必要的。现在，这位红发少女不再那么感激了，她低头叹息，因为电脑提示又收到了一条消息。整个下午，随着她回归的震惊逐渐消退，她一直在接收这些消息。大多数消息都是嘲讽她的评论，还有一些是男生发来的约会邀请。只有四条消息是欢迎她回来的，尽管她预料到了这些，除了零发来的那条。

Turning her head slightly, Asuka glanced at the blue-haired girl sitting on her left. She was actually listening to the teacher and taking notes, a far cry from the Rei that used to sit with a bored expression on her face while staring out the window. She flinched when Rei turned and made eye contact for a moment before they both turned away. She let her eyes roam around the room, though she already knew where everyone was sitting. Touji and Kensuke were behind her, and Hikari was in front while Shinji sat on the right. The girl didn't know whether to feel mad at being boxed in or happy that they were protecting her in some way. Asuka settled on a state of indifference, as she knew that she should have been annoyed but she couldn't muster up the energy. She hadn't lied to either Misato or Shinji when she had told them that she was empty inside. And it was that emptiness that was causing her not to care about many things.

微微侧头，明日香瞥了一眼坐在她左边的蓝发女孩。她竟然在认真听讲并做笔记，与往日那个面露无聊、望着窗外发呆的零截然不同。当零转头与她短暂对视后，两人都迅速移开了视线。明日香环顾四周，尽管她早已清楚每个人的座位。东治和健介在她后面，光在前面，而真嗣坐在右边。她不知该对这种被围困的感觉生气，还是该为某种保护而感到高兴。明日香选择了漠然，因为她知道自己本应感到烦躁，却无力生气。她没有对美里或真嗣撒谎，当她说自己内心空洞时。正是这份空洞，让她对许多事情都漠不关心。

She jumped a little when the bell finally rang, as she had been lost in thought about the people around her. After saving her notes, Asuka slid her textbooks back into her bag and waited for the classroom to empty of students before she left. As she walked through the door and out into the hallway she ignored the various looks and glances that students were throwing her. The ones that had only heard of her by rumor stared at her, wondering why she wasn't living up to her reputation. The ones that knew her and had not forgiven her were not even trying to hide their contempt as she walked to her locker.

当铃声终于响起时，她微微一跳，因为她一直在沉思周围的人。保存好笔记后，明日香将课本滑回书包，等待教室里的学生离开后才起身。她走出教室，进入走廊，对学生们投来的各种目光和眼神视而不见。那些仅通过传闻听说过她的人盯着她，好奇她为何不符合她的名声。那些认识她且未曾原谅她的人，在她走向储物柜时，毫不掩饰他们的蔑视。

"Hey Soryu, what's the matter?" taunted one girl as Asuka pulled on her shoes. "Where's the stuck up prima donna or did you finally realize that you're a nobody?"

嘿，索吕，怎么了？" 一个女孩在明日香穿鞋时嘲讽道。"那个自命不凡的公主去哪了，还是你终于意识到自己什么都不是？

Asuka didn't reply to the girl's comments knowing that what she said was true. But the girl wasn't going to let Asuka leave just yet as she showed by grabbing her shoulder. Asuka looked at the girl, waiting for her to do something, and as she waited she wondered if this was how Rei had reacted to her years ago. She knew that she should do something as the girl raised her hand and swung it at her face, but Asuka just stood there. Yet the hand didn't touch Asuka as another person intervened and grabbed the offending girl's wrist and twisted.

明日香没有回应女孩的话，因为她知道女孩说的是真的。但女孩并不打算就这样让明日香离开，她通过抓住明日香的肩膀表明了这一点。明日香看着女孩，等待她采取行动，同时她想知道几年前丽是否也是这样回应她的。她知道应该有所行动，当女孩举起手向她的脸挥来时，明日香却只是站在那里。然而，那只手并没有碰到明日香，因为另一个人介入，抓住了那个冒犯的女孩的手腕并扭动。

"Let her go, Miyu." growled Shinji, increasing the pressure.

"放开她，美雪。" 真嗣咆哮着，加大了压力。

"Okay," whimpered the girl letting go of Asuka.

"好的，"女孩轻声抽泣着放开了明日香。

Shinji released the girl and turned to the redhead, "Let's go, Hikari is waiting for us."

真嗣放开女孩，转向红发少女说："我们走吧，光在等我们。"

Stunned, Asuka followed Shinji, as he made his way through the crowd that had gathered to see what was happening. Looking at some of the faces, the girl saw she wasn't the only one surprised by Shinji's actions. Yet some flinched as he touched them like this wasn't the first time that he had stepped out of character. Stepping through the door, she saw Hikari waiting with Touji, who was talking to Kensuke while Rei stood silently by. She found herself smothered in hug for the second time that day as she got within range of Hikari. Conscious of the eyes on them, she briefly returned the hug before backing away and looking at her best friend besides Shinji.

愕然中，明日香跟随着真嗣，穿过聚集起来看热闹的人群。她观察着一些面孔，发现对真嗣的行为感到惊讶的不止她一人。然而，当真嗣这样触碰他们时，有些人畏缩了，仿佛这不是他第一次做出格的事。穿过门，她看到光正和东治在一起，东治正和健介交谈，而零则静静地站在一旁。当她走近时，又一次被光紧紧拥抱。意识到众人的目光，她短暂地回应了这个拥抱，然后退开，看向除了真嗣之外最好的朋友。

Gone were the twin pigtails of junior high as Hikari's brown hair hung straight down her back. Asuka wondered if everyone had become a giant, as the two girls were eye-level but when she looked down she saw the heels that gave Hikari the necessary inches. Her skirt was longer and her blouse looser than what Asuka wore, showing that she hadn't overcome her conservative nature. Yet when Touji approached them there were no glances at the young man or any blushing.

初中时的双马尾已不复存在，光那棕色的长发笔直地垂在背后。明日香不禁疑惑，是不是每个人都长高了，因为两位女孩的视线齐平，但当她低头一看，发现是高跟鞋给了光所需的身高。光的裙子比明日香的要长，衬衫也更宽松，显示出她尚未摆脱保守的天性。然而，当东治走近时，她并没有看向那位年轻人，也没有脸红。

"Hikari was wondering if you wanted to go with Rei and her to the mall for some shopping," commented Touji as he pointed at the girls and ignored Hikari.

"光正在想你是否愿意和零还有她一起去商场购物，" 透二边说边指着那两个女孩，却忽略了光。

"I was going to ask her, Touji. I’m capable of speaking for myself," was the sharp retort.

"我本来就打算问她的，透二。我自己能说话，" 是尖锐的反驳。

"Well, the touching moment was getting to me." This time Touji was smiling as he replied.

"嗯，那个感人的时刻让我有些动容。"这次，东二微笑着回答。

Hikari stalked over to Touji and glared up at him. Her frown disappeared as Touji rested his hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes. Freeing her shoulders, Hikari backed away and turned back to Asuka.

光缓缓走向冬二，抬头瞪着他。当冬二将双手放在她肩上，凝视她的眼睛时，她的皱眉消失了。光挣脱肩膀，后退一步，转头看向明日香。

"So do you want to go?" She pleaded with Asuka.

"那么，你想去吗？" 她恳求着明日香。

Asuka looked down as Hikari grabbed her hands. "I'm sorry but I have an appointment with..." She stopped when Shinji placed a hand on her shoulder.

明日香低头看着，光抓住了她的手。"对不起，但我有个约会……" 她停了下来，因为真嗣把手放在了她的肩上。

"You're allowed to miss a session or two under certain circumstances." He held up a hand. "Dr. Leibling will understand. In fact, I'm sure he would approve of this."

在某些情况下，您缺席一两次会议是被允许的。" 他举起一只手，"莱布林博士会理解的。事实上，我相信他会赞成这一点。

Looking around at the expectant faces, Asuka nodded. "Okay."

环顾四周期待的表情，明日香点头道："好的。"

"Great."

- - - -

"What’s the matter with you, Asuka?"

你怎么了，明日香？

Asuka stopped looking through the racks of blouses at that question. Turning, she saw Hikari approaching, her arms full of clothing. As Hikari dumped the load on a chair Asuka tried to come up with an answer to the question. She knew Hikari had been waiting to ask that question since they had left school. Her lack of emotion and response during classes would have been enough to set Hikari thinking.

听到这个问题，明日香停止了浏览衣架上的衬衫。她转过身，看到光正抱着一堆衣服走过来。光把衣服堆在椅子上，明日香则试图想出一个答案。她知道自从离开学校后，光就一直等着问这个问题。她在课堂上缺乏情感和反应，足以让光开始思考。

"What?"

"Don't what me, Asuka. I'm talking about what happened to my friend that was always full of energy and life." Hikari stared hard into the redhead’s eyes. "This quiet girl in front of me isn't Asuka. The Asuka I knew would have been angry at being scorned and ridiculed. She also wouldn't have simply stood waiting to get hit."

别这样看着我，明日香。我在说那个总是充满活力和生机的我的朋友怎么了。" 光紧紧盯着红发女孩的眼睛。"我面前的这个安静的女孩不是明日香。我认识的明日香在被蔑视和嘲笑时会生气。她也不会只是站在那里等着被打。

The girl shook her head sadly. "The old me is dead and buried Hikari."

女孩悲伤地摇了摇头，"过去的我已经死了，埋葬了，Hikari。"

"I don't believe that for an instant." She watched as the teen slumped in her chair.

"我一刻也不相信。" 她看着那个少年瘫坐在椅子上。

"You don't understand Hikari. I lost the thing that gave me a purpose in life and an identity."

“光，你不明白。我失去了赋予我生活目的和身份的东西。”

Hikari stood there silently as her friend stared at the floor, not wanting to make contact. As she watched, Asuka's body trembled, causing her to kneel down in front of her friend. She was somewhat relieved to see there were no tears sliding down cheeks, but the smile Asuka gave her was forced. Standing up, she hugged the redhead, looking to see how many people were watching the activity. The only person that had noticed was Rei and she walked over to the two girls.

Hikari 静静地站在那里，看着她的朋友盯着地板，不愿与人对视。当她注视时，Asuka 的身体颤抖起来，使她跪在了朋友面前。看到 Asuka 脸上没有泪水滑落，她略感宽慰，但 Asuka 给她的微笑显然是勉强的。站起来后，她拥抱了红发的 Asuka，环顾四周，看看有多少人在注意这场面。唯一注意到的人是 Rei，她走向了这两个女孩。

"Did EVA mean that much to you?" Hikari asked.

"EVA 对你来说真的那么重要吗？" 光问道。

"Yes," Asuka's voice was barely above a whisper. "I poured everything I had into it, but when I started failing and losing…" She looked up at Hikari and Rei. "Well you saw what happened to me when I lost my purpose."

是的，" 明日香的声音几乎低不可闻。"我倾注了我所有的一切，但当我开始失败和失去……" 她抬头看向光和丽。"嗯，你们看到了我失去目标后的样子。

"And that resulted in this person we see now?" inquired Rei.

"那么，这就是我们现在看到的这个人吗？" 丽询问道。

"Yes."

Rei stood there silently as she digested what she had just heard from the redhead. A frown formed on her face as she watched Asuka sitting there, not saying a word. She reached a decision about what to do and, ignoring the noise of protest from Hikari, grabbed Asuka by the upper arm. With a little force, Rei guided Asuka to the front display of the store. Both girls remained silent as they stared through the glass, watching the boys who were waiting. Rei smiled faintly as Shinji joked with his friends.

丽静静地站在那里，消化着从红发女孩那里听到的信息。她看着坐在那里的明日香一言不发，眉头紧锁。她做出了决定，不顾光抗议的噪音，抓住了明日香的上臂。稍微用力，丽引导明日香来到商店的前窗展示区。两个女孩都沉默地透过玻璃凝视，看着那些等待的男孩们。当真嗣和他的朋友们开玩笑时，丽微微一笑。

"Rei?"

“Would you say that Shinji has changed?”

“你认为真嗣变了吗？”

Asuka nodded. “Of course he has.”

明日香点头道：“他当然变了。”

“Really?” Rei waited as Asuka watched the scene outside the store. The faint smile was all she needed.

“真的吗？”丽等待着，明日香则注视着店外的场景。那淡淡的微笑对她来说已经足够。

“He’s stronger, more confident than before, when we fought the Angels.” Asuka watched Rei out of the corner of her eye. “But he’s still the caring and gentle boy that I always made fun of.”

“他比以前更强大、更自信了，当我们对抗使徒时。”明日香用眼角余光观察着丽。“但他仍然是那个我总是取笑的体贴温柔的男孩。”

Rei shook her head. “That is not correct. Shinji is the same as before. It is just that he made some choices no one else could.”

绫波摇了摇头。“那是不对的。真嗣和以前一样。只是他做出了别人无法做出的选择。”

“But…” Asuka watched as Rei turned to her.

“但是…” 明日香看着绫波转向她。

“The strong man was always there but he hid it. You know it is true.”

“那个强壮的男人一直都在，只是他隐藏了起来。你知道这是真的。”

“Yeah, I guess so.” “是的，我想也是。”

“He made a decision to find a balance. Shinji decided he would allow his strength to show while remaining a caring person.” She took a step toward Asuka, causing the redhead to back away. “You have to make the same decision. You have to find a balance or you will become lost.”

“他决定寻找平衡。真嗣决定在展现自己力量的同时，仍然保持一颗关怀他人的心。”她向明日香迈出一步，使得红发少女后退。“你也必须做出同样的决定。你必须找到平衡，否则你会迷失自我。”

July 22, 2018, Sunday

She didn't know when she had started liking the dark again as she lay in the small living room, staring at the far wall. The darkness enveloped her like a blanket, reassuring her that she was secure and protected from everything around her. The thought that she should hate the darkness, with the feeling of loneliness that it always brought her, never even entered Asuka's mind. Even after she had spent two years in the darkness with no dreams and no comfort, just the inky blackness of her mind as she tried to escape the real world, she didn't hate it. And that was what she wanted to do now as she lay on her side, curled and twisted up. Her arms tingled as they provided support for her head. She slowly released a shaky breath as she thought about the need to be free of pain.

她不知道自己何时又开始喜欢上了黑暗，当她躺在狭小的客厅里，凝视着远处的墙壁时。黑暗如毯子般包裹着她，让她感到安全，仿佛被周围的一切所保护。她本应憎恨黑暗，因为它总是带来孤独感，但这样的念头从未在明日香的心中浮现。即便在无梦无慰藉的黑暗中度过了两年，只有她试图逃离现实世界时脑海中那浓墨般的漆黑，她也不曾憎恨。此刻，她侧卧着，蜷曲纠结，正是她想要的状态。双臂支撑着头部，微微发麻。她缓缓吐出一口颤抖的气息，思索着摆脱痛苦的必要。

Asuka didn't dare close her eyes or the scene she had witnessed at school would be shown. Yet she did close her eyes for a moment, as her body tried to get its needed rest, and saw two happy people smiling and laughing as she stood in the background. That was all her mind showed her before she awoke with a jerk from the pain and her hands clenched into fists. For all her pain Asuka had not shed a tear since that incident, and that was comforting for the girl as she remembered how much she had cried in the last few months from letting her walls down and trying to rid herself of the past. She knew Rei had been wrong in telling her that she needed to find herself, to find a balance between her personalities. Asuka's new self was just as fake as her old self in dealing with people, yet her old self had kept her heart safe.

明日香不敢合眼，否则学校目睹的那一幕便会浮现眼前。然而，身体渴望休息的本能驱使她短暂地闭上了眼睛，恍惚中，她站在背景里，看见两个快乐的人在笑语欢声。这便是她脑海中闪现的全部，随即剧痛袭来，她猛然惊醒，双手紧握成拳。自那次事件后，尽管痛苦万分，明日香未曾落泪，这份坚强让她感到慰藉，回想起过去几个月因卸下心防、试图摆脱过去而泪流满面的日子。她明白，绫波丽说她需要寻找自我、在不同人格间找到平衡是错误的。明日香的新自我在与人相处上与旧自我同样虚假，但旧自我至少守护了她的心。

The sound of a door opening down the small hallway caused her body to tremble, as if it wanted to become smaller to escape notice. She hoped that the person was going to the bathroom, as she wanted to stay alone. But that hope was dashed as footsteps told her that someone was walking toward her. Asuka felt her heart race, but exhaled in relief as the kitchen light was turned on and the sound of the faucet running indicated that she was safe. The seconds stretched as she waited for the lights to be turned off and the person to return to their room. After what seemed an hour to Asuka, the lights were finally extinguished and the person left the kitchen, but they didn't move down the hall, instead they walked into the living room.

走廊尽头门扉开启的声响，令她身躯一颤，仿佛欲缩小以避人耳目。她暗自希望那人只是去洗手间，好让她独享片刻宁静。然而，渐近的脚步声粉碎了这希冀。明日香感到心跳加速，但随着厨房灯光亮起，水龙头流水声传来，她才松了口气，确认自己未被察觉。时间仿佛被拉长，她静候着灯光熄灭，那人回房。对明日香而言，那段等待犹如漫长的一小时，终于灯光熄灭，那人离开了厨房，却并未走向走廊，而是步入了客厅。

Asuka tried to get her body to curl up tighter as she waited and listened to the nightlife. She heard the slow deliberate steps as the person walked farther into the room, coming closer to her position. Even when the footsteps stopped next to her Asuka didn't move or look up instead she tightened her hold on her legs. Even with her eyes closed she knew the other person was looking at her and wondering what was happening. A soft sigh followed by a thump alerted Asuka that the other person had sat down close to her, yet it wasn't until a hand rested on her leg that she looked up to see Misato. She could feel that her roommate was frowning when she didn't move or respond.

明日香试图让自己的身体蜷缩得更紧，同时聆听着夜生活的喧嚣。她听到那人缓慢而刻意的脚步声，正一步步深入房间，逐渐逼近她的藏身之处。即便脚步声停在了她身旁，明日香依旧纹丝不动，也不抬头，只是更用力地抱紧双腿。尽管双眼紧闭，她能感觉到对方正注视着她，心中充满疑惑。一声轻叹伴随着坐下的声响，让明日香意识到那人已坐在她附近，但直到一只手搭在她的腿上，她才抬头望去，映入眼帘的是美里。她能感觉到，当自己毫无动作和回应时，室友正皱着眉头。

Misato knelt in front of her, watching and waiting for the young woman to do something in response. She had woken up in the middle of the night, thirsty and a little hungry, and had gone to the kitchen. She had noticed Asuka’s foot in the light and it disturbed her to see the teen lying on the floor alone, and curled up. She had watched the girl carefully as she went through therapy and read every report of every incident at the school, and it had looked like the girl was finally opening up and finding a balance. Yet the scene before her presented neither a young woman who was opening up nor one who had found a balance. All she could feel was an immense pain coming from the girl as Asuka stared back with a blank face.

三笠跪在她面前，观察并等待着这位年轻女子做出反应。她半夜醒来，口渴又有点饿，便去了厨房。她注意到明日香的一只脚在灯光下，看到这个少女独自蜷缩在地板上，让她感到不安。她仔细观察了女孩的治疗过程，阅读了学校发生的每一起事件的报告，看起来女孩终于开始敞开心扉，找到了平衡。然而眼前的场景既没有展现出正在敞开心扉的年轻女子，也没有找到平衡的迹象。她只能感受到来自明日香的巨大痛苦，而明日香则面无表情地回望着她。

"You should be in bed, Asuka. You need your sleep,” said Misato mildly. "Is school going okay?" This time she saw Asuka's hands tighten. "Are the boys being idiots again?" A shake of Asuka’s head was the reply. "Or has it been one boy? I've noticed that you and Shinji..."

"你应该在床上睡觉，明日香。你需要休息，”三笠温和地说。“学校还好吗？”这次她看到明日香的手紧握起来。“是那些男生又在犯傻吗？”明日香摇头作为回答。“还是说，是一个男生？我注意到你和真嗣……”

"Don't say that name," hissed Asuka amazed at the anger in it.

"别说那个名字，" 明日香低声说道，惊讶于其中的愤怒。

Misato nodded her head. "Well that was easy, it only took me three tries compared to the normal half hour."

葛城点了点头。"嗯，这还算容易，我只试了三次，相比平时半小时可快多了。"

"Just leave me alone, Misato."

就让我一个人静一静，美里。

"Sorry, but I can't do that."

对不起，我做不到。

"Fine!" Asuka stated before falling silent.

"好吧！" 飞鸟说完便沉默了。

"What happened between the two of you?” inquired Misato after a few minutes of silence. “This last week has been tense. You've…"

你们俩之间发生了什么事？”沉默了几分钟后，Misato 问道。“这一周来气氛一直很紧张。你……

"I told you I don't want to talk about it!"

我告诉过你我不想谈这个！

Asuka heard Misato moving after her last comment and hoped that her guardian would let the conversation die. But like many of her recent hopes and wishes, this one was not granted as Misato touched her cheek, causing her to lift her head. Blue eyes stared into brown as the two women each waited for the other to make the first move. Asuka flinched as was helped to a kneeling position. As they knelt there, the redhead tried to read Misato's face but the dim light wasn't enough. She knew that Misato would have the same look on her face as Shinji when he was trying to get her to open up. Remembering that name brought a frown to her face.

明日香听到美里在她最后一句话后有所动作，希望她的监护人会让对话就此结束。但就像她最近许多的希望和愿望一样，这个愿望并未实现，美里轻触她的脸颊，使她抬起头来。蓝眼睛与棕眼睛对视，两位女士都在等待对方先行动。明日香在被扶着跪坐起来时微微一缩。她们跪坐在那里，红发少女试图解读美里的表情，但昏暗的光线不足以让她看清楚。她知道美里脸上的表情会和真嗣试图让她敞开心扉时的表情一样。想起那个名字，她的脸上露出了不悦。

"These last seven months I have watched the two of you," started Misato. "You two did everything together and were inseparable. Shinji neglected his friends and schoolwork to help and be around you. But that wasn't all since he wasn’t the only person involved. I don't know what finally made you trust him and start opening up, but you have. The two of you have been there for each other, especially Shinji..."

“过去这七个月里，我一直在观察你们俩，”美里开始说道，“你们俩形影不离，做什么都在一起。真嗣为了帮助你和陪伴你，忽视了他的朋友和学业。但这不仅仅是他一个人的事。我不知道是什么最终让你信任他并开始敞开心扉，但你们确实做到了。你们俩一直相互支持，尤其是真嗣……”

"That was in the past Misato, not now or the future."

那是过去的事了，碇真嗣，不是现在，也不是未来。

"Bullshit, Asuka!"

Asuka flinched at the words, like Misato had injured her. "You don't understand."

明日香听到这些话时畏缩了一下，仿佛碇真嗣伤害了她。"你不明白。"

"Yeah, I don't understand. I don't understand how two people who are so close aren't speaking to each other. I don't understand how two people that care for each other are deliberately hurting the other. I don't..."

是的，我不明白。我不明白两个如此亲近的人怎么会互不说话。我不明白两个彼此关心的人怎么会故意伤害对方。我不明白……

"You don't understand!" shouted Asuka. "He has led me on since I woke up with his fake caring and meaningless gestures. But it was all a game to him as he knew he was going to hurt me."

你不懂！" 阿苏卡喊道。"自从我醒来后，他就一直用虚假的关心和毫无意义的举动来误导我。但这一切对他来说只是一场游戏，因为他知道他会伤害我。

"Asuka!"

"It's true! He's betrayed my trust for someone else. I can't trust him anymore with my feelings or my…" Asuka bit back a sob, unable to say the last part.

是真的！他为了别人背叛了我的信任。我再也无法将我的感情或我的……”明日香哽咽着，无法说出最后那部分。

"Heart?" Ventured Misato, knowing it was true. "Why don't you tell me what happened?"

心脏？" 真嗣试探着问道，心里明白这是真的。"你为什么不告诉我发生了什么？

"No."

"I can't help you if you don't tell me."

如果你不告诉我，我帮不了你。

Asuka didn't say anything as she reached up and turned a lamp to its lowest setting. With the additional light, she could see that Misato was being truthful about wanting to help. Slowly, she lowered her hands back to her knees and nodded, wanting to get this over with. This time she didn't flinch as Misato rested her hand on Asuka's.

明日香没有说话，她伸手将台灯调至最低亮度。有了额外的光线，她能看出美里是真的想帮忙。她缓缓地将手放回膝盖上，点了点头，想要尽快结束这一切。这次，当美里把手放在明日香手上时，她没有退缩。

"Please trust me, Asuka."

请相信我，明日香。

Nodding, she began, her voice low and unsure. "It was nine days ago. And as you know, I was…"

她点头开始讲述，声音低沉而不确定：“那是九天前的事了。如你所知，我当时……”

July 13, 2018, Friday 2018 年 7 月 13 日，星期五

One corner of the school grounds was always empty during lunch as it was distant from the building and had no benches or tables. But Asuka didn't mind as she leaned her back against the large solitary oak that grew there. She had been coming to this particular area for the last three months as it kept her away from everybody, mainly the boys. She was still adjusting to school life even so many months later as the insults still came and boys still lusted after her. It had been the boys that had forced her out here. They grew bolder with their statements as they saw a quiet girl had replaced the loud demon. Asuka pushed those thoughts from her mind and opened the lunch she had prepared since it was her day to make the lunches.

校园的一角在午餐时分总是空无一人，因为它远离教学楼，也没有长椅或桌子。但明日香并不介意，她背靠着那里一棵孤零零的大橡树。过去三个月，她一直来这个特定区域，因为它让她远离了所有人，尤其是男生。尽管已经过了这么久，她仍在适应学校生活，因为嘲讽依旧，男生们依旧对她垂涎三尺。正是这些男生把她逼到了这里。他们看到一个安静的女孩取代了曾经的喧闹恶魔，于是愈发大胆地表达自己的想法。明日香将这些念头抛诸脑后，打开了自己准备的午餐，因为那天轮到她做午饭了。

Letting her eyes wander around the grounds, Asuka picked out groups of students that seemed interesting to her. Hikari was off with a bunch of girls talking about who knows what, while Touji and Kensuke were by themselves at another table. It had come as a surprise to learn that Touji and Hikari had been together for only a year before breaking it off. She had not asked for the details, as it was not her place to pry, considering she herself was getting her own life back together. Also it saddened her because if someone as caring as Hikari couldn't make a relationship work, what chance did she have? Yet for all that had happened between them, Hikari was still friends with Touji, just like her and Shinji. At that thought, Asuka looked around trying to find the boy but he was nowhere in sight.

让目光在校园里游走，明日香挑选出一些看起来有趣的学生群体。光和一群女生不知在聊些什么，而东治和健介则独自坐在另一张桌子旁。得知东治和光在一起仅一年就分手了，她感到意外。她没有追问细节，因为这不是她该打探的，考虑到她自己也在重新整理自己的生活。这也让她感到悲伤，因为如果像光这样体贴的人都不能维持一段关系，她又有什么机会呢？尽管他们之间发生了那么多事，光仍然和东治保持着朋友关系，就像她和真嗣一样。想到这里，明日香四处寻找那个男孩，但他却不见踪影。

"Figures," muttered Asuka as she came to her feet.

"不出所料，" 明日香一边站起来一边嘟囔道。

It was none of her business what Shinji was doing but she found herself walking to the school. She had told him that she wanted to eat by herself today, wanting to be alone for no particular reason, and he had agreed. It had probably been a mistake for him to be alone as the more determined girls always flocked to him when she wasn't around. Asuka felt a pang of nervousness in her stomach at that thought but she didn't know why. Of all the girls around, Shinji spent most of his time with her and barely talked to the others. She knew he wasn't being rude but that he was not interested in the other girls. That brought a smile to her face as she thought how close they really were, but her smile disappeared quickly. Neither of them had hinted at wanting to be more than just friends and she wondered why that suddenly worried her. She was about to open the door when a voice cried out.

真嗣在做什么与她无关，但她发现自己正走向学校。她曾告诉他自己今天想独自用餐，没有特别原因，只是想独处，他也同意了。或许他独自一人是个错误，因为每当她不在时，那些更坚决的女孩总会围着他转。想到这里，明日香感到一阵紧张，却不知为何。在所有女孩中，真嗣大部分时间都与她在一起，几乎不与其他人交谈。她知道他并非无礼，只是对其他女孩不感兴趣。这让她想到他们之间的亲密，不禁微笑，但笑容很快消失。两人都未曾暗示想要超越朋友关系，她不明白为何这突然让她担忧。就在她要开门时，一个声音喊了出来。

"Soryu!"

Turning, she saw a couple boys approaching and frowned as they came closer. She didn't have time for this. Crossing her arms under her breasts she waited, feeling the old fire building deep inside her, something that had been going on for a month. Asuka had kept that to herself, happy that she had finally started finding a balance between calmness and fire. And at the moment the fire was building, growing hotter as she saw a smirk on one of the boys’ face. Frowning, Asuka knew it was time to let everyone know that she wasn't going to tolerate this anymore. Glaring at the boys, she waited for them to come closer and start their routine.

转身间，她看到几个男孩正走近，随着他们越来越近，她皱起了眉头。她没时间应付这些。她双臂交叉在胸前等待着，感到内心深处那股旧火正在燃起，这种情况已经持续了一个月。明日香一直将此深藏心底，庆幸自己终于开始在平静与激情之间找到平衡。此刻，那火焰正愈燃愈烈，当她看到其中一个男孩脸上的坏笑时，更是如此。明日香皱着眉头，知道是时候让大家明白，她不会再容忍这一切。她怒视着男孩们，等待他们走近并开始他们的把戏。

"What?" Asuka saw them pause as they heard the anger in her voice, but they recovered.

"怎么了？" 明日香看到他们听到她声音中的怒气而停顿了一下，但很快又恢复了常态。

"Just wondering if you were doing anything this weekend," commented one of the boys.

"只是想知道你这个周末有没有安排，" 一个男孩评论道。

"I have no plans." She paused watching their reactions, seeing them grin. "To do anything with either of you."

我没什么计划。" 她停顿了一下，观察他们的反应，看到他们咧嘴笑了。"和你们俩都没什么计划。

But that didn't deter them. "Why not? It'd just be you and us having dinner and…"

但这并没有让他们退缩。“为什么不呢？只是你和我们一起吃个晚饭，然后……”

Asuka felt the fire flare. "And then what? A hotel room where you think you could get me into bed!" She shouted as she leaned in closer. "Fat chance of that. I have no interest in sleeping around with complete assholes or turning into a slut! I suggest that you pass that on to everyone, got it?"

明日香感到怒火中烧。“然后呢？去酒店房间，你以为能把我弄上床！”她大声喊着，身体前倾。“做梦去吧。我对和混蛋鬼混或变成荡妇毫无兴趣！我建议你把这话传给所有人，明白了吗？”

With that, she spun around and grabbed the handle for the door but before she could do anything, a hand grabbed her wrist. Looking over her shoulder, she glared at the boy touching her.

就这样，她转身抓住了门的把手，但还没来得及做什么，一只手就抓住了她的手腕。她回头瞪着那个触碰她的男孩。

"Let go."

"Why?" commented the boy holding her. "So you can go find your little guardian angel called Shinji Ikari. Let me tell you something Soryu, he's been playing you for a fool all these months and you've fallen for it. Mr. Ikari already has a girlfriend and he's seeing her right…"

为什么？"抓住她的男孩说道，"这样你就可以去找你的小守护天使，叫什么来着，碇真嗣。让我告诉你，Soryu，这几个月他一直在愚弄你，而你却上当了。碇先生已经有女朋友了，他现在正和她在一起……

Asuka watched the boy's face go white and his eyes widen in shock as she withdrew her foot from his crotch. The boy slowly fell to the ground clutching his injured body part in pain and trying to speak but all that came out was a squeak. Smirking, she turned to the other boy but he was already backing away from her, which was fine. Yanking the door open she strode through the hallways on a mission to find Shinji and see what was happening. She knew that Shinji wasn’t seeing anyone or at least she hoped that was the truth. If he was seeing someone she was going to…

明日香看着男孩的脸色变得苍白，眼睛因震惊而睁大，当她从他的胯部抽回脚时。男孩缓缓倒在地上，痛苦地捂着受伤的部位，试图说话，但发出的只有一声尖叫。她得意地笑了笑，转向另一个男孩，但他已经在后退了，这倒也无妨。她猛地拉开门，大步穿过走廊，决心找到真嗣，看看发生了什么。她知道真嗣没有和任何人交往，至少她希望这是真的。如果他在和别人交往，她就要……

"To do what?" she asked herself.

"要做什么呢？" 她自问。

She found that answer soon enough as she rounded a corner to head for the lockers. Asuka found that her body wouldn't move as she saw Shinji talking to another girl as they came out of a classroom. Her body started to shake as they laughed and walked away from her. At that moment, Asuka felt something break inside her. As they disappeared around a far corner, Asuka knew that her trust in Shinji had been misplaced. Swallowing the lump in her throat she turned around and walked to the classroom.

她很快就找到了答案，当她拐过一个弯走向储物柜时。明日香发现自己的身体动弹不得，因为她看到真嗣正在和一个女孩从教室里走出来交谈。当他们笑着离开她时，她的身体开始颤抖。那一刻，明日香感到内心有什么东西破碎了。当他们消失在远处的拐角时，明日香知道她对真嗣的信任是错误的。她咽下喉咙里的硬块，转身走向教室。

/ / / /

"So that's what happened. I found him with another girl and…" Asuka couldn't go on, her voice and body filled with pain.

"原来如此，我看到他和另一个女孩在一起，然后……" 明日香说不下去了，她的声音和身体充满了痛苦。

"Did you ask him for an explanation?"

你向他要求解释了吗？

Asuka shook her head. "Why, so he could deny everything? He broke my trust Misato, I can't go to him and tell him how I feel."

明日香摇了摇头。“为什么，好让他否认一切吗？他辜负了我的信任，Misato，我不能去找他并告诉他我的感受。”

"Why not?"

"I just can't." Asuka shook her head. "I just can't."

我就是做不到。" 明日香摇了摇头。"我就是做不到。

Misato sat there watching as Asuka repeated herself. She knew the two of them had been close, closer than anyone else she had known. But to see that intimacy being ripped apart was destroying them and her. The pain she had to see in each teenager’s eyes as they avoided each other or when they wouldn't talk. Standing, she went over to Asuka and helped her to her feet, trying to ignore the tremors racing through the girl’s body. With an arm around the girl, Misato walked down the hall and opened the door to her bedroom. She knelt down at the side of the bed after Asuka crawled underneath the blankets.

美里坐在那里，看着明日香重复自己的话。她知道这两个孩子曾经非常亲密，比她所认识的任何人都亲密。但眼看着这份亲密被撕裂，正在摧毁他们，也摧毁着她。每当他们避开对方或是不交谈时，她不得不在每个青少年的眼中看到痛苦。美里站起身，走到明日香身边，扶她站起来，尽力忽略女孩身体中传来的颤抖。她用一只手臂环绕着明日香，沿着走廊走去，打开了卧室的门。在明日香钻进被窝后，美里跪在床边。

"I think you need to talk to Shinji or the girl and get the truth," commented Misato as she brushed some hair out of Asuka's face. "I may be wrong but I think you jumped to conclusions without having all the facts. The bond that you two have is strong but it can get stronger." She smiled faintly at Asuka. "Don't do what I did and break something that’s very important to both of you."

我觉得你需要和真嗣或那个女孩谈谈，了解真相，" 弥薩托边说边把明日香脸上的头发拨开。"我可能错了，但我认为你在没有掌握所有事实的情况下就下了结论。你们俩之间的纽带很牢固，但还可以更牢固。" 她对明日香微微一笑。"不要像我那样，毁掉对你们俩都非常重要的东西。

"Misato..."

"Please, promise me that you'll get the truth."

请答应我，你会去了解真相。

The redhead nodded after a few seconds. "I promise."

几秒钟后，红发女子点了点头。“我保证。”

Misato leaned down and kissed Asuka on the forehead. "Good."

葛城美里俯身亲吻了明日香的前额。“很好。”

July 27, 2018, Friday 2018 年 7 月 27 日，星期五

Misato's words echoed through Asuka's head, even though it had been a five days since that night, as she walked through the halls. That week had been one of determination and fear for the girl, spilling over into her sessions with the psychologist. The funny thing was that he had told her the exact same things Misato had said about jumping to conclusions and bonds. Though Asuka had made a promise to get an explanation, it had taken some time to get the information she needed. She knew that the easiest way would have been to confront Shinji but if everything was just in her head she didn't want to hurt him anymore with false accusations. Therefore she had spent the last week searching out the little harlot who had been with Shinji.

即使已过去五天，美里的话仍回荡在明日香脑海中，她穿行于走廊间。那一周，少女心中充满了决心与恐惧，这些情绪也渗透到了她与心理学家的会谈中。有趣的是，心理学家告诉她的，正是美里关于不要妄下结论和关于纽带的同样话语。尽管明日香承诺要得到一个解释，但获取所需信息却花费了一些时间。她知道最简单的方法是直接质问真嗣，但如果一切只是她的臆想，她不想再用无端的指控伤害他。因此，她过去一周都在寻找那个曾与真嗣在一起的小妖精。

Reaching forward, she slid the door open and stepped through, not bothering to close it. Ignoring the whispers and stares that were coming from the underclassmen, Asuka walked to the far corner where the girl, Maki Kusaka, was standing with her friends, and stopped behind her. It took less than a minute for the girl's friends to recognize Asuka and make excuses to leave their friend. Patiently, Asuka waited for Maki to turn around and when she finally did, there was no surprise on her face. The two girls stood there, one glaring and the other calmly staring back.

她伸手推开门，跨了进去，并未费心关上。无视低年级学生们传来的窃窃私语和目光，明日香走向角落，那里站着女孩楠瀬真琴和她的朋友们，她停在了真琴身后。不到一分钟，真琴的朋友们就认出了明日香，纷纷找借口离开了朋友。明日香耐心等待着真琴转过身来，当她终于转身时，脸上并无惊讶之色。两个女孩就这样站着，一个怒目而视，另一个则平静地回望。

"You, come with me," commanded Asuka before turning around.

"你，跟我来。"明日香命令道，随即转身离去。

"What do you want to talk about, Soryu?" inquired Maki after they had left the building.

"你想聊些什么呢，Soryu？" Maki 在他们离开大楼后问道。

Asuka felt her nails digging into her palm as she clenched her fists. "You and Shinji. What’s going on between the two of you?"

明日香感到自己的指甲深深嵌入手掌，她紧握着拳头。"你和真嗣。你们俩之间到底发生了什么？"

"So that's what this is all about," said Maki with a smile.

"原来这就是全部的缘由，" Maki 微笑着说。

"Answer the question!" 回答问题！

"Me and Shinji? What's going on between us?" She leaned in close, catching Asuka off guard. "Absolutely nothing."

我和真嗣之间？我们之间发生了什么？" 她凑近了，让明日香措手不及。"绝对什么都没有。

"You're lying!"

Maki walked to a bench and sat down watching, Asuka. "Why would I have to lie when it's the truth? There’s nothing going on between the two of us, so I don't know why you're questioning me. If you're having a problem with Shinji you should be talking to him."

真希走到长椅旁坐下，注视着明日香。"既然是事实，我为什么要撒谎？我们俩之间什么都没有，所以我不明白你为什么质疑我。如果你和真嗣有问题，你应该直接和他谈。"

"Shut up!" screamed Asuka as she was losing control. "I saw the two of you together. Both of you looked like you were having a fun time. Now answer my question!"

闭嘴！" 明日香失控地尖叫道，"我看到你们俩在一起。你们俩看起来都很开心。现在回答我的问题！

The girl looked at her, smiling like she knew a secret that Asuka didn't. "I get it now. You're jealous."

女孩看着她，微笑中仿佛藏着阿苏卡未知的秘密。“我现在明白了，你是嫉妒了。”

"I am not!"

"Of course you are, and now you know what a lot of us feel. The anger of being passed over for another person. The pain of knowing that you'll never have a place in that person's…" Maki's tirade was cut short as Asuka slapped her.

"当然，你现在知道了我们许多人的感受。那种被别人取代的愤怒。那种知道自己永远无法在那个人心中占有一席之地的痛苦……" Maki 的咆哮被 Asuka 的一巴掌打断了。

"You bitch! I'm not jealous. You don't know what it feels like to see the person that you trust with another person. So don't say that you know what I'm feeling."

你这个贱人！我不是嫉妒。你不知道看到你信任的人和别人在一起是什么感觉。所以别说自己知道我的感受。

Maki glared at Asuka, holding her cheek. "I know that feeling, but you don't want to believe that there is nothing between us. Well let me tell you something, Shinji is my tutor."

真希瞪着明日香，捂着脸颊说：“我明白你的感受，但你不想相信我们之间什么都没有。那我告诉你，真嗣是我的家教。”

"Tutor in…" sneered Asuka.

“家教……”明日香嘲讽道。

"Mathematics." Maki stood close to Asuka with her hands on her hips. "If you think Shinji has betrayed your trust then that says your trust of him was weak to begin with. You saw something and immediately jumped to conclusions without talking to Shinji first. Instead of trusting him like you say you did, you severed all contact." She gripped Asuka's hands. "Don't let him get away, Soryu. He cares for you and is hurting without knowing why."

数学。" 麻衣站在明日香身边，双手叉腰。"如果你认为真嗣背叛了你的信任，那说明你对他的信任本来就不牢固。你看到了一些事情，没有先和真嗣沟通就立刻下结论。你所谓的信任他，实际上却切断了所有联系。" 她紧握住明日香的手。"别让他离开，惣流。他关心你，不知道原因地感到痛苦。

"But…" whispered Asuka, trying to gather her thoughts at the sudden change of subjects.

"但是…" 明日香低声说道，试图在话题突然转变时整理思绪。

"But nothing. You're lucky to have someone that cares for you so much. That is why so many girls hate you." Maki turned and started toward the school. "Don't let this opportunity pass you by."

但没什么。你有这么关心你的人，真是幸运。这就是为什么那么多女孩讨厌你。" 真希转身朝学校走去。"别让这个机会溜走了。

Asuka stood there for a few minutes trying to digest everything that had happened. She couldn't believe how right everyone had been in telling her to first get the truth. It hurt to know that she had jumped to conclusions and knew what Shinji must be feeling at the moment: alone and hurting without knowing why. As the first bell faded, the redhead shook her head, and walked to their homeroom, thinking of what must be done to correct the situation. Glancing at Shinji as she took her seat, Asuka knew she had to act fast to correct her mistake.

明日香站在那里，花了好几分钟试图消化所发生的一切。她无法相信每个人告诉她先了解真相是多么正确。知道她自己妄下结论，以及真嗣此刻一定感到的孤独和痛苦，这让她感到痛苦。随着第一声铃声消逝，红发少女摇了摇头，走向他们的教室，思考着必须采取什么措施来纠正这一局面。当她坐下时瞥了一眼真嗣，明日香知道她必须迅速行动来纠正自己的错误。

July 31, 2018, Tuesday

"Well?"

Asuka asked that question as she stepped out of the dressing room and stood in front of Misato and Hikari. Misato tried to decide if she should be angry or amused at what her roommate was wearing. The blue evening dress hung loosely on the girl, reaching to the floor, while hiding her curves, while giving a hint of what was underneath. Thin spaghetti straps held up the dress while to further draw eyes; the bodice was designed to draw eyes to the swell of the girl's bust. Glancing over, Misato saw Hikari staring at Asuka with a combination of awe and embarrassment.

明日香一边走出更衣室，一边向站在面前的美里和光提出了那个问题。美里试图决定自己应该对室友的穿着感到生气还是好笑。那件蓝色晚礼服松垮地挂在女孩身上，拖至地面，遮掩了她的曲线，却又隐约透露出底下的风光。细如发丝的肩带支撑着裙子，而紧身胸衣的设计更是为了吸引目光，聚焦于女孩胸前的隆起。美里瞥了一眼，看到光正带着敬畏与尴尬交织的表情凝视着明日香。

"Isn't that a bit much?" commented Hikari. "You're only going on a date with Shinji, not trying to take him to bed."

这会不会有点过头了？" 光评论道，"你只是和真嗣去约会，又不是要带他上床。

"Who says I don't want to take him to bed?" the redhead asked smiling.

"谁说我不想带他上床？"红发女子笑着问道。

"Asuka!" The other two females shouted in shock.

"明日香！"另外两名女性震惊地喊道。

"You two are no fun," pouted Asuka. Walking over to the mirrors she examined how she looked. "How about you, Misato? Do you agree that this is too much?"

你们两个真没劲，" 明日香噘着嘴说道。她走到镜子前，审视着自己的样子。"你呢，美里？你也觉得这太过分了吗？

"I have to agree with Hikari on this one. The dress is a little too much." Misato smiled faintly. "You don't want Shinji to faint."

我得同意光在这件事上的看法。这条裙子确实有点过分了。" 美里微微一笑。"你总不想让真嗣晕倒吧。

"Fine," Asuka said, defeated. "But I do look good, right?"

好吧，" 明日香认输了，"但我看起来不错，对吧？

Misato rested her hands on Asuka's shoulders. "Yes, you look beautiful but remember that you shouldn't move too fast. You two have all the time in the world, so don't rush it."

美里将双手搭在明日香的肩上，"是的，你看起来很美，但要记住，你们俩有的是时间，所以不要急于求成。"

"But I've made so many mistakes, Misato."

但我犯了这么多错误，美里。

"You're human just like everyone else." With that, Misato disappeared into the store reappearing moments later. "I think this would be more suitable, wouldn't you say so Hikari?"

你和其他人一样，也只是个普通人。" 说完，美里消失在商店里，片刻后又出现了。"我觉得这个更合适，你说呢，光？

"Yes."

Asuka stepped forward and took the dress from Misato's outstretched hands. Memories flashed as she unfolded it and looked at in the light of the store. It was remarkably close to the sundress she had worn when she had first met Shinji and been reunited with Misato. The dress reached mid-thigh and had sleeves but her shoulders would still be exposed and the cut seemed like it would still hug her body. Her fingers glided along the pale gold silk as she pictured what she would look like when wearing it. Turning around, she dashed back into the stall with a smile on her face, and changed quickly. Misato and Hikari were smiling as she stepped out of the room.

明日香向前一步，从美里伸出的手中接过裙子。她展开裙子，在店里的灯光下凝视，记忆如潮水般涌来。这条裙子与她第一次遇见真嗣并重逢美里时所穿的太阳裙惊人地相似。裙摆及至大腿中部，带有袖子，但肩膀依然裸露，剪裁似乎仍能紧贴她的身形。她的手指沿着淡金色丝绸滑动，想象着自己穿上它的模样。转身后，她带着笑容冲回试衣间，迅速换好衣服。美里和光看到她走出房间时都面带微笑。

"Much better," said Hikari.

“好多了，”光说道。

"Shinji's definitely going to be speechless when he sees you." Misato paused and turned a critical eye on Asuka. "How does it fit?"

当真嗣看到你时，他肯定会无言以对。" 碇真嗣停顿了一下，用挑剔的眼光打量着明日香。"合身吗？

Asuka blushed slightly. "It's a little tight in the chest." Turning, she looked in the mirror. "And the waist is too high. I thought you knew my dimensions Misato."

明日香微微脸红。"胸部有点紧。" 她转过身，照了照镜子。"而且腰身太高了。我还以为你知道我的尺寸呢，美里。"

"Why would I know them?" Misato asked before disappearing again.

"我怎么会认识他们？" 真嗣问完又消失了。

Hikari stepped up to her friend, pulling on her sleeves. "Nervous?"

光走到朋友身边，拉了拉她的袖子。"紧张吗？"

"Yeah, it's so weird for me to be doing this. I promised myself that I’d never get close to one person and here I am, shattering that promise." Asuka laughed lightly, trying to get her mind off of her date coming up on Saturday.

"是啊，我做这事感觉好奇怪。我曾发誓绝不接近任何人，现在我却打破了誓言。" 明日香轻声笑了笑，试图让自己不去想周六即将到来的约会。

"But you don't have anything to be nervous about. You've known Shinji for over three years so there shouldn't be any problems."

但你没什么好紧张的。你认识真嗣已经超过三年了，应该不会有什么问题。

The girl shook her head. "Did you forget that out of those three years I spent two of them catatonic?"

女孩摇了摇头：“你忘了那三年里，我有两年是处于紧张症状态吗？”

"Still, he is basically the same person you met on the Over the Rainbow," said Misato as she joined the conversation. "That’s what your date is about, isn't it? The three year anniversary of your moving in with us." She watched as Asuka blushed. "Thought so."

尽管如此，他基本上还是你在《彩虹之上》遇见的那个人，" 美里加入对话时说道。"这就是你们约会的意义，不是吗？你们搬来和我们一起住的三周年纪念日。" 她看着明日香脸红，"我就知道。

"But…"

"No buts, young lady. Just be the confident and energetic girl he knows. Oh, but this time leave out the superiority complex and arrogance."

没有但是，小姑娘。就做那个他所认识的自信和充满活力的女孩。哦，但这次要摒弃那种优越感和傲慢。

"I know that Misato. It was those two things that got me into trouble in the first place," Asuka admitted. "Still, I haven't been on a date for years."

我知道你说的 Misato。就是那两件事让我一开始就陷入了麻烦，" 明日香承认道，"尽管如此，我已经好几年没约会过了。

Misato shook her head. "I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Asuka. What happened to the girl that always plunged ahead without caution? The girl that didn't care how others did things because she did them her own way."

美里摇了摇头。"真不敢相信这话是从你嘴里说出来的，明日香。那个总是不顾一切勇往直前的女孩去哪了？那个不在乎别人怎么做，只按自己的方式行事的女孩。"

"This is too important for me, Misato. I get one chance to do it correctly and I don't want to make a mistake."

这对我是太重要了，Misato。我只有一次机会把它做好，我不想犯任何错误。

"Just do what comes naturally and follow your instincts. Now are you going to try on the sizes I brought or are we just going to stand around talking? We have a lot more shopping to do!"

就顺其自然，跟随你的直觉吧。现在你是要试穿我带来的尺码，还是我们就站在这里聊天？我们还有很多购物要做呢！

August 4, 2018, Saturday

Shinji looked at the note in his hand one more time before continuing his walk down the street. He didn't know what to expect as the note only told him to be at a certain place at a certain time. Pushing back the sleeve of his suit jacket, he glanced at his watch and saw that he would arrive in plenty of time, yet he wasn't excited. Three weeks had passed since Asuka had stopped talking to him and started pushing him away. Nothing he said had gotten her to tell him what was wrong or if he had screwed up in some way, her only response had been silence. Now he was on his way to see her by written request since she had been out of the house the whole day. He hoped the roses would be enough to show Asuka that he still cared, even if it meant their friendship was over.

慎二再次看了看手中的便条，才继续沿着街道前行。他不清楚会有什么等着他，便条上只告诉他要在特定的时间到达某个地点。他推开西装外套的袖口，瞥了一眼手表，发现自己会提前很多到达，但内心并无波澜。自从三周前明日香开始对他沉默并疏远以来，无论他说什么，她都不肯透露问题所在，或是他是否做错了什么，她的回应只有沉默。如今，他应她的书面请求前去见她，因为她一整天都没在家。他希望那些玫瑰足以向明日香表明，即使他们的友谊就此结束，他依然在乎她。

Shaking his head, Shinji continued toward his destination weaving through the crowd, careful not to crush the flowers. He wondered if Asuka knew the significance of the day. Three years of pain as they went through their own hells, scarred in more ways than one as one retreated from the world and the other was forced to face life. Yet Asuka had woken up and he had learned to live, and the last months had been fun in a strange way. He had watched Asuka grow from a girl who felt empty and worthless to one that was a mixture of old and new, chaos and calm. Shinji remembered the times when he had to be the strong one, a role he was not used to, but slowly their relationship had become one of friendship. That all had ended a few weeks ago.

摇了摇头，真嗣继续向目的地前进，穿梭于人群中，小心翼翼地避免压坏花朵。他思索着明日香是否知晓这一天的意义。三年的痛苦，他们各自经历了地狱般的磨难，以多种方式留下了伤痕，一个从世界退缩，另一个被迫面对生活。然而，明日香已经醒来，他也学会了生活，过去几个月在某种奇异的方式中充满了乐趣。他见证了明日香从一个感到空虚无价值的女孩，成长为新旧交织、混乱与宁静并存的人。真嗣回忆起那些不得不扮演坚强角色的时刻，那并非他所习惯，但渐渐地，他们的关系转变为友谊。这一切在几周前结束了。

It was only because he stopped to admonish himself that he didn't run into the girl standing in front of him. Shinji stared at the blue shoes a moment before letting his eyes travel up long legs, taking in the gentle curves of her hips and narrow waist. A gentle cough drew his eyes from Asuka's bust to her face and the small smile gracing her lips. He was surprised to see a small locket attached to the blue choker around her throat while diamond studs glittered in the light. Slowly he reached out and brushed some of her hair back over her shoulder, enjoying the silky feel of it. Smiling, he stared into her sky blue eyes getting lost for a moment before a hand on his cheek brought him back.

正是因为他停下来告诫自己，才没有撞到站在他面前的女孩。真嗣凝视着那双蓝色的鞋子，片刻后目光顺着修长的双腿上移，欣赏着她柔和的臀部曲线和纤细的腰肢。一声轻咳让他从明日香的胸前移开视线，看向她带着微笑的嘴唇。他惊讶地发现，她脖子上蓝色项圈上挂着一个小巧的锁骨链，而钻石耳钉在灯光下闪闪发光。他缓缓伸出手，将她的一些头发拨到肩后，享受着那丝滑的触感。微笑着，他凝视着她天蓝色的眼睛，一时迷失在其中，直到一只手轻触他的脸颊将他拉回现实。

"I'm sorry, Shinji," said Asuka lightly as she let her hand drop.

"对不起，真嗣，"明日香轻声说道，同时放下了手。

"For what?" He had an idea of what she was talking about but wanted to hear the words.

"为什么？" 他大概知道她在说什么，但还是想听她亲口说出来。

Asuka forced herself not to look away. "For these last three weeks. I've treated you like shit for no good reason."

这最后三周，我无缘无故地对你很差劲。

"At the time, it was probably a valid reason."

当时，这可能是一个合理的理由。

"No it wasn't, I was being..." Asuka stopped as Shinji stepped closer and touched her hand before backing off.

"不，并不是，我当时是……" 明日香停了下来，因为真嗣走近并触碰了她的手，然后又退了回去。

"Shhh, let's drop it for now," stated Shinji as he felt the nervousness rise at being so close to Asuka in a non-supportive role. "You look very nice, beautiful in fact."

嘘，我们暂时别提了，" 真嗣说道，他感觉到在非支持性的角色中如此接近明日香时紧张感上升。"你看起来真的很漂亮，实际上很美。

"Thank you," Asuka replied shyly as she felt her cheeks heat up. "You look good also."

谢谢，" 明日香羞涩地回答，感到自己的脸颊发热。"你也很好看。

Shinji tried not to shiver as Asuka straightened his tie and made his jacket more presentable. He ignored the glances and whispers from the pedestrians as they passed and saw this demonstration. Asuka stepped back and looked at what she had accomplished, a finger on her chin. Smiling, she glanced down at his hands before looking at him in a silent question. As she stood there waiting, Shinji finally figured out why she was acting like this. She was nervous, probably just as much as him and to hide it she was keeping busy.

真嗣试图不让自己颤抖，因为明日香正在整理他的领带，让他的外套看起来更得体。他忽略了路过的行人投来的目光和窃窃私语，他们目睹了这一幕。明日香退后一步，审视着自己的成果，手指轻触下巴。她微笑着，低头看了看他的手，然后抬头用无声的眼神询问他。当她站在那里等待时，真嗣终于明白了她为何如此行事。她也很紧张，可能和他一样，为了掩饰，她让自己忙碌起来。

"Why are you so nervous all of sudden?" she asked. "You were so confident minutes ago. Though I like both sides of you."

你怎么突然这么紧张？"她问道，"几分钟前你还很自信呢。不过，我喜欢你的每一面。

"It's just that it's finally sunk in." Shinji pulled at his collar.

"只是现在终于明白了。" 真嗣拉了拉自己的衣领。

"What has?"

"That this has suddenly turned into a real date and I'm with you."

没想到这突然变成了真正的约会，而且还是和你在一起。

"Don't you want to be with me?" teased Asuka.

"难道你不想和我在一起吗？" 明日香打趣道。

"Yes, but…" Shinji swallowed trying to form the words. When he finally spoke, it was barely above a whisper. "It's just that this is…"

想，但是…" 真嗣吞吞吐吐地试图说出话来。当他终于开口时，声音几乎低不可闻。"只是这太…

"Is what?" inquired Asuka, moving closer, almost touching him.

"什么啊？" 明日香一边问，一边靠近，几乎要碰到他了。

"My first date." 我的第一次约会。

Asuka's eyes widened at that admission. Though she had heard from her and Shinji's friends that he had never dated, she had never truly believed it. Mainly because it seemed so farfetched for her to believe that Shinji would truly wait for her to wake up in the hope that he would have a chance. After all, her last words to him had not been kind and had been designed to wound him to the core. Yet hadn't she had all the proof since waking up that she was very important to him and that he didn't care about the past? Slowly she reached for his hand, feeling her own shaking as they made contact.

听到这个坦白，明日香的眼睛睁大了。尽管她从她和真嗣的朋友那里听说他从未谈过恋爱，但她从未真正相信过。主要是因为她觉得难以置信，真嗣竟然真的会等她醒来，希望有机会。毕竟，她对他说过的最后一句话并不友好，而是有意要深深伤害他。然而，自从醒来后，她不是已经得到了所有证据，证明她对他非常重要，而他并不在乎过去吗？她缓缓地伸出手去握他的手，感觉到自己的手在接触时颤抖。

"Well, you could say that this is my first date also," admitted Asuka as she wrapped her fingers around Shinji's. She wasn’t going to count the failed outing with the medical student as a date

"嗯，你也可以说这也是我的第一次约会，"明日香承认道，她用手指缠绕住真嗣的手。她并不打算把那次与医学生的失败外出算作约会。

Shinji didn't do anything as he tried to react to her admission and gentle touch. Finally he followed her example and squeezed her hand gently. "These are for you."

真嗣面对她的坦白和温柔触碰，一时不知所措。最终，他学着她的样子，轻轻地握紧了她的手。“这些是给你的。”

"I was wondering when you were going to give them to me." Asuka took the flowers and led Shinji to a nearby door.

"我还在想你什么时候才会把它们给我呢。" 明日香接过花，领着真嗣走向附近的一扇门。

Smiling, the boy let himself be led into the foyer of the restaurant. As they walked toward the maitre d’ station, he stared at the various works of art adorning the wall. His artistic tastes ran more toward music so he was unable decide if the paintings were of quality. A tug on his arm brought his attention back to Asuka as they got in the short line, the adults giving them curious glances. Keeping his eyes from wandering was easy as Asuka was just as gorgeous as any of the other women and she hadn't even reached her full potential. However he did feel out of place. That feeling only increased as the maitre d' stared at the two EVA pilots with distaste.

微笑着，男孩任由自己被领进餐厅的大堂。当他们走向领班台时，他凝视着墙上装饰的各种艺术品。他的艺术品味更倾向于音乐，因此无法判断这些画作是否优质。手臂上的一拉让他将注意力转回到明日香身上，他们加入了短队列，成年人向他们投来好奇的目光。由于明日香和其他任何女性一样美丽，甚至还未达到她的全部潜力，所以不让自己眼神游离是容易的。然而，他确实感到格格不入。当领班带着厌恶的眼神盯着两位 EVA 驾驶员时，这种感觉愈发强烈。

"Do you have reservations?" The man asked.

"您有预订吗？" 那人问道。

"It will be under Soryu for two."

它将在 Soryu 下持续两小时。

Looking at the screen, the man nodded. "Do you have any identification?"

看着屏幕，男子点了点头。“您有身份证件吗？”

"Why?" asked Asuka, sharply.

"为什么？" 明日香尖锐地问道。

"It is the policy of this establishment that children are not to be allowed," replied the maitre d’ smugly.

"这是本店的规定，不允许儿童进入。" 餐厅领班得意地回答。

"Children," muttered Asuka as she dug through her purse. She smiled dangerously, as she slid a plastic card to the man. "Will this do?"

孩子们，" 阿苏卡低声说着，翻找着她的手提包。她危险地笑了笑，将一张塑料卡片滑向那个男人。"这个行吗？

Shinji watched the man turn white and swallow nervously when he picked up the object. After a few glances between Asuka and what he was holding, the man slid it through a card reader. A few seconds later he handed her possession back and motioned for them to follow. Weaving through the main dining room the trio walked up a flight of stairs to an upper level where the tables were spread farther apart to allow for more privacy. Shinji waited until Asuka had taken her seat before settling into his chair.

真嗣看着那个男人拿起物品时脸色发白，紧张地吞咽。在几次目光在阿苏卡和他手中的东西之间徘徊后，男人将其通过读卡器。几秒钟后，他把东西还给她，示意他们跟上。三人穿过主餐厅，走上楼梯到达一个上层，那里的桌子间隔更远，以提供更多隐私。真嗣等到阿苏卡坐下后，才在椅子上安顿下来。

"Your waiter will be along shortly," spoke the maitre d'. "Please enjoy your evening.”

"您的服务员很快就会过来，"餐厅领班说道，"请享受您的夜晚。”

"You enjoyed that didn't you?" Shinji asked after the man was gone.

"你很喜欢那个，不是吗？" 真嗣在那人离开后问道。

Asuka grinned. "Yep, it's always fun to bring someone down a notch or two."

明日香咧嘴一笑：“是啊，让人降降火总是挺有趣的。”

"Just like old times. What did you show him?"

就像往昔一样。你给他展示了什么？

"My NERV ID," replied Asuka. "No one can refuse NERV personnel."

我的 NERV 身份，" 阿苏卡回答道，"没人能拒绝 NERV 的人员。

Shinji smiled, but didn't say anything as he racked his brain for something to talk about. He wanted to ask Asuka about what had happened in the preceding weeks, yet he didn't, as he knew she would explain in time. The silence stretched as they studied the menus, the waiter hovering around, waiting for their orders. Also they wanted privacy for what they were going to discuss. It wasn't until their appetizers arrived that Shinji finally broke the ice.

真嗣微笑着，但并未言语，他绞尽脑汁寻找话题。他想询问阿苏卡过去几周发生的事情，但他没有开口，因为他知道她会在适当的时候解释。两人默默地研究菜单，服务员在一旁徘徊，等待他们点餐。他们也希望有私密空间来讨论即将讨论的事情。直到开胃菜上桌，真嗣才终于打破沉默。

"At least it wasn't windy today," Shinji commented.

"至少今天没有风，" 真嗣评论道。

Asuka looked at him puzzled. "What?"

明日香困惑地看着他。"什么？"

"We wouldn't want a repeat performance of our first meeting on a sidewalk, would we?"

我们肯定不想在人行道上重演我们的初次会面，对吧？

Understanding flashed in Asuka's eyes and her cheeks turned pink. "Yeah, that was quite a memorable first meeting, though I'm sure you enjoyed it more than me."

明日香眼中闪过理解的光芒，双颊泛起红晕。“是啊，那真是一次难忘的初次见面，尽管我确信你比我享受得多。”

"Well I was concentrating more on your face than anything else." Shinji said as the memory came forth.

"嗯，我更多地是在关注你的脸，而不是其他任何东西。" 真嗣回忆道。

"Sure you were," Asuka said blandly. "So what was I wearing?"

当然，你是在关注。" 明日香平淡地说，"那我穿了什么？

"A plain pair of white..." He stopped abruptly, realizing what he had just said. "Umm…well you see."

一双普通的白色..." 他突然停下，意识到自己刚刚说了什么。"呃…这个嘛，你看。

"Stop while you're ahead, Shinji." Asuka watched as the boy’s entire face turned red.

"适可而止吧，真嗣。" 明日香看着男孩的脸整个变红了。

"The human eye is drawn to movement you know," stated Shinji.

"你知道，人类的眼睛会被运动吸引，"真嗣说道。

Asuka shook her head. "You don't know when to quit, do you? Though I did get my revenge with the plugsuit." She grinned when he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

明日香摇了摇头。"你不知道什么时候该停止，对吧？不过我确实用插入栓服报了仇。"当他在座位上不安地挪动时，她咧嘴笑了。

"Did you do that on purpose?" he asked quietly.

"你是故意的吗？"他轻声问道。

"Maybe. Maybe not."

With that comment, both teens turned their attention back to the food in front of them. Asuka stared at Shinji thoughtfully as she slowly ate the shrimp cocktail. She watched as he stirred his soup without tasting it. The little exchange before had been one to break the ice but when it died off, neither had continued. Asuka sighed, knowing what was going on and knew that it was her turn.

那句话之后，两个少年又将注意力转回到面前的食物上。明日香一边慢慢吃着虾仁鸡尾酒，一边若有所思地盯着真嗣。她看着他搅动着汤却不尝一口。之前的简短交流本是为了打破沉默，但随着对话的结束，两人都没有继续下去。明日香叹了口气，她知道发生了什么，也知道轮到她开口了。

"Did you hate me back then? The arrogant girl who disturbed your peaceful existence."

那时候你讨厌我吗？那个打扰你平静生活的傲慢女孩。

Shinji shook his head slightly. "No, I never hated you. You were so many things that I wasn't. Energetic, confident, outgoing, and self-assured. These were traits that you had that I wished I did."

真嗣轻轻地摇了摇头。“不，我从没讨厌过你。你拥有那么多我所没有的特质。充满活力、自信、外向且自立。这些都是我所渴望拥有的。”

"So you didn't hate me, even though I was always trying to hurt your feelings? Or when I told you I wished I had never met you and you should have never been born?" Asuka's voice had started out strong, but had ended in a whisper.

"所以你并不恨我，即使我总是试图伤害你的感情？或者当我告诉你，我希望从未遇见过你，你根本不该出生？" 明日香的声音起初很坚定，但最后变成了耳语。

"No," replied Shinji. "When you said those things, I was too far gone myself to care any more."

不，" 回应的是真嗣。"当你说那些话时，我自己已经太过迷失，不再在乎了。

Asuka didn't have anything to say to that; instead she stared at a wall while sipping her water. She had just broken the promise they had made months ago to not bring up the past. Sure she could have blamed Shinji for breaking it first with his comment about the wind, but that was more of a joke. Her comments were meant to dig into the past, yet she needed to do this. Before she could go forward, she had to clear up the past.

明日香对此无言以对，只是凝视着墙壁，小口啜饮着水。她刚刚打破了数月前他们共同许下的不提过去的承诺。当然，她本可以把责任推给真嗣，因为他先开了关于风的玩笑，但那更多是玩笑而已。她的言论却是故意触及过去，然而她必须这么做。在向前迈进之前，她需要清理掉过去。

"Earlier this year, when you wanted to gain my trust, you said something that was very important." She started. "You said you had realized you had been using me as a false support. What did you mean by that?"

今年早些时候，当你想赢得我的信任时，你说了一句非常重要的话。" 她开始说道，"你说你意识到自己一直在把我当作虚假的依靠。你那话是什么意思？

Silence stretched as Shinji bowed his head, not even noticing when the waiter approached with their meals. It wasn't until they were alone again that he raised his head and stared at Asuka. Neither could look away as they were both drawn deeper into each other. Shinji broke the contact by closing his eyes and sighing.

沉默蔓延，真嗣低下头，甚至没注意到服务员端着他们的餐点走近。直到再次独处，他才抬起头，凝视着明日香。两人都无法移开视线，越陷越深。真嗣闭上眼睛，叹了口气，打破了这种对视。

"I was using you as a support back then, Asuka,” He admitted. “As long as you were the strong one, the one who enjoyed life so much, it meant that I didn't have to change. I could always turn to you and tell myself that I could be happy if I stayed with you."

"那时我把你当作依靠，明日香，”他坦白道，“只要你还是那个坚强的人，那个如此享受生活的人，就意味着我不必改变。我总能转向你，告诉自己只要和你在一起，我就能快乐。”

"Shinji, I ran away from life."

真嗣，我逃离了生活。

"Please, I need to say this," he begged. "Even when you were catatonic I was using you. I kept convincing myself for half a year that change would not be worth it because I would still fail. Even as I watched you grow thinner and pale, I told myself you were strong, that you were facing your demons." Shinji glanced down. "And I convinced myself that when you woke up that things would be the same, you the pillar of strength and me clinging to you."

求你了，我必须说出来，"他恳求道。"即使在你处于木僵状态时，我也在利用你。我不断说服自己，半年来改变不值得，因为我仍然会失败。即使看着你日渐消瘦、面色苍白，我还是告诉自己你很坚强，你在面对自己的心魔。"真嗣低头看了看。"我甚至说服自己，当你醒来时，一切都会和以前一样，你是坚强的支柱，而我紧抓着你。

Asuka sat there surprised at his words. "Why did you think that? What changed?”

明日香坐在那里，对他的话感到惊讶。“你为什么会这么想？有什么变化吗？”

"Because you were always honest with me. You don't sugarcoat things like Misato or give me cryptic statements like Rei." His face darkened. "And you never used me like my father did. You spoke your mind and pointed out things that others didn't."

“因为你总是对我坦诚相待。你不会像美里那样粉饰事实，也不会像绫波那样说些晦涩的话。”他的脸色阴沉下来。“而且你从未像我父亲那样利用我。你直言不讳，指出了别人没有注意到的事情。”

"I did that to demean you."

我那样做是为了贬低你。

Shinji continued without hearing Asuka. "Yet at times you showed a hidden inner self. The time you cried for your mother, when I saved you in the volcano and saw you smile, and what happened before the 12th Angel. Not only that but you liked my music and gave me my first kiss." He gave her a nervous smile. "It was those things and more along a rather severe chewing out that finally forced me to change. How could I even face you when you woke up if I was going to use you? The pain I felt would be nothing to yours when you realized how much time had passed. If I didn't change and learn to enjoy life, how could I ever expect to tell you how I feel or ask for the chance to start over. And it worked. I gained your trust and we're good friends but..."

真嗣没有听到明日香的声音，继续说道：“然而，你有时会展现出隐藏的内心。你为母亲哭泣的时候，我在火山救你时看到你微笑，还有在第 12 使徒之前发生的事。不仅如此，你还喜欢我的音乐，给了我第一个吻。”他紧张地笑了笑。“正是这些事情，再加上一次严厉的斥责，最终迫使我改变。如果我打算利用你，我怎么有脸在你醒来时面对你？我所感受到的痛苦与你意识到时间流逝多少时所承受的痛苦相比，根本不值一提。如果我不改变，不学会享受生活，我怎么可能期望告诉你我的感受，或请求重新开始的机会。而这一切都奏效了。我赢得了你的信任，我们成了好朋友，但是……”

"I hurt you again," Asuka interrupted.

"我又伤害了你，"明日香打断道。

"Yes," agreed Shinji, his eyes full of pain. "Is it over between us, Asuka? Is our friendship finished?"

"是的，" 真嗣同意道，眼中满是痛苦。"我们之间就这样结束了吗，明日香？我们的友谊就此终结了吗？"

"No it's not over," whispered the redhead. "I saw you with Maki Kusaka and instead of going to you, I jumped to conclusions. You betrayed me, you toyed with my feelings and I was going to hurt you or at least that's what I told myself." She frowned at the memory. "I had said that I trusted you, but it showed me I have a long way to go. That's why I asked you out today. Because I wanted to apologize and to see if you can forgive me, and give me another chance."

"不，还没结束，"红发女子低声说，"我看到你和楠坂真希在一起，却没有找你求证，而是妄下结论。你背叛了我，玩弄了我的感情，我本想伤害你，至少我是这么告诉自己的。"她回忆起这些，眉头紧锁。"我曾说过信任你，但这件事让我意识到自己还有很长的路要走。这就是为什么今天我约你出来，因为我想道歉，想看看你是否能原谅我，再给我一次机会。"

Shinji moved his chair next to Asuka, aware that people were staring at them. He took her hand in his and held it gently as he stared into her blue eyes that were full of doubt and pain. His heart sank as Asuka gave him a sad smile but he was happier now that he knew what had happened to cause trouble in their friendship.

意识到众人目光的注视，真嗣将椅子挪到明日香旁边。他握住她的手，温柔地凝视着她那充满疑虑与痛苦的蓝眼睛。当明日香向他露出悲伤的微笑时，他的心沉了下去，但得知导致他们友谊出现裂痕的缘由后，他感到一丝欣慰。

"Why wouldn't I forgive you? You're the most important person in my life. I just wish that you had come to me first."

我怎么会不原谅你呢？你是我生命中最重要的人。我只是希望你当初能先来找我。

"Shinji…"

"But I understand why you did it, though I'm partly to blame. I should have told you about Maki a long time ago." Shinji squeezed her hand harder. "And I think that no matter what happens between the two of us, we'll continue to hurt each other. Whether it's intentional or not, all we can do is trust each other and our feelings."

但我理解你为何这么做，尽管我也有部分责任。我早该告诉你关于真希的事。" 真嗣更用力地握紧了她的手。"我想，无论我们之间发生什么，我们都会继续伤害彼此。无论是有意还是无意，我们能做的只有相互信任和珍惜彼此的感情。

"I know, but you have to agree that it's hard to keep going at times."

我知道，但你必须承认有时候坚持下去很难。

"Yes, I do," Shinji ran a finger around the rim of his glass. “I’ve been wondering…”

"是的，我承认，" 碇真嗣用手指绕着杯口转了一圈。“我一直在想……”

“About what?” she interrupted, grinning at the sudden shift.

“关于什么？”她打断道，对这突然的转变咧嘴一笑。

“If I made the right decision in giving you that teddy bear for your birthday.

“如果我为你生日送你那只泰迪熊的决定是正确的。

“I like it,” the girl said quietly. “Why do you ask?”

“我喜欢它，”女孩轻声说道，“你为什么问这个？”

“Misato said something about you hating dolls.”

“Misato 提到过你讨厌玩偶。”

“I do.”

Shinji saw her frown. “So why did you keep it?”

真嗣看到她皱起了眉头。“那你为什么还留着它？”

“It’s an animal. I don’t feel threatened by it. I don’t feel like it’ll replace…” She trailed off, staring blankly past the boy.

“它只是个动物。我不觉得它有威胁。我也不觉得它会取代……”她话没说完，目光空洞地越过男孩望向别处。

Shinji didn’t want to see her depressed. "Remember Touji's response to your slap?"

真嗣不想看到她沮丧的样子。"还记得东治对你那一巴掌的反应吗？"

Asuka groaned and chuckled. "Oh god, do I remember it. A boy who had just got a peek of my panties drops his pants. How could I forget it?" She smiled at Shinji. "Thanks."

明日香哼了一声，轻笑起来。"哦，天哪，我当然记得。一个刚偷看到我内裤的男孩，竟然脱下了自己的裤子。我怎么可能忘记呢？" 她对真嗣微笑道："谢谢。"

"You're welcome." 不客气。

“Remember when Kensuke was taking all those pictures of me?” Asuka saw Shinji nod. “Well for one of them he got caught by a couple girls and…"

“还记得健介拍我那么多照片的时候吗？”明日香看到真嗣点头。“其中一次他被几个女生发现了，然后……”

- - - -

Shinji stared up at the ceiling, his arms behind his head while a cool breeze came through his window. He couldn't sleep as there was too much going through his head after their date. His usual retreat was on the floor, forgotten, and the sounds of nightlife never registered as all he could remember was Asuka laughing as they retold the fun times from the Angel War. She had a wonderful laugh, a light and airy sound like chimes, to go with her devastating smile. Shinji groaned trying to forget how much he had wanted to kiss Asuka and feel her body press up against his. He couldn't believe he was thinking those thoughts again but the night had ended so well. It had gone from one of dread to one of reassurance then finally to happiness.

真嗣仰望着天花板，双臂枕在脑后，一阵凉风从窗外吹来。约会后的思绪纷乱，让他难以入眠。平日里的避风港——地板，已被遗忘，夜生活的喧嚣也未曾留下痕迹，他脑海中回荡的只有明日香在重温天使战争趣事时的笑声。她的笑声美妙动听，轻盈如风铃，与她那令人心动的微笑相得益彰。真嗣呻吟着，试图忘却自己多么渴望亲吻明日香，感受她的身体紧贴自己的那一刻。他不敢相信自己又陷入了这些思绪，但那个夜晚结束得如此美好。它从最初的恐惧，到后来的安心，最终化为了幸福。

Not to mention that Asuka looked very nice in her dress. He was saved from further thoughts by the sound of his door sliding open and shut. With a minimal amount of movement, he reached and turned his desk light to its lowest setting and looked at his door. The girl stood there in a T-shirt that only came down to mid-thigh, clutching the teddy bear to her chest. When she smiled, Shinji was reminded of an angel, all innocence and purity. As she walked over to his bed he had to remind himself that for all her faults she was innocent. He also had to force himself to breathe when she sat on his bed, blue panties showing as her shirt rode up on her.

更不用说明日香穿着那条裙子看起来非常漂亮。他被开门和关门的声音从进一步的思绪中拯救出来。他几乎没有移动，伸手将桌灯调至最低亮度，然后看向房门。那个女孩站在那里，穿着一件只到她大腿中部的 T 恤，怀里紧抱着一只泰迪熊。当她微笑时，真嗣想起了天使，满是纯真和纯洁。当她走向他的床时，他不得不提醒自己，尽管她有缺点，但她仍是纯洁的。当她坐在他的床上，蓝色内裤随着衬衫上移而显露时，他不得不强迫自己呼吸。

"Pervert," stated Asuka, but did nothing to cover up. "I'm not here to have sex with you."

色狼，"明日香说道，但没有遮掩自己。"我不是来和你发生关系的。

"Oh," replied Shinji, hoping his relief didn't show. "Than what are you here for?"

哦，" 真嗣回答道，希望自己的宽慰没有表现出来。"那你是来做什么的？

"To talk," explained the girl. "Now turn off your light."

说话，" 女孩解释道，"现在把灯关掉。

"Okay." The room was plunged into darkness with a click of the switch and Shinji lay there waiting.

"好的。" 随着开关的咔哒声，房间陷入了黑暗，真嗣躺在那里等待着。

"Will you come out from underneath there?"

你会从那里出来吗？

Shinji slid out of his warm bed into the cool air and waited on the edge of the mattress. He sat there listening to Asuka mutter under her breath as she rearranged his sheets and blankets. After a couple minutes, a hand reached out of the darkness and fumbled on his body until she found his arm. With a quick yank Shinji fell forward to land on something warm and soft. A quick exploration with his hand told him he was laying in the girl's lap. Before he could react, her hands pulled him up into a sitting position.

真嗣从温暖的床上滑入凉爽的空气中，坐在床边等待。他坐在那里，听着明日香低声嘟囔，同时整理着他的床单和毯子。几分钟后，一只手从黑暗中伸出，摸索着他的身体，直到找到他的手臂。用力一拉，真嗣向前倒去，落在某个温暖柔软的东西上。他用手快速探索，发现自己是躺在女孩的腿上。还没等他反应过来，她的手就把他拉起来，坐直了身子。

"Better not get too frisky Shinji or something that could start won't."

真嗣，别太放肆，否则可能会引发一些不该发生的事。

"What?"

But his question wasn't answered; instead a blanket was tossed over his shoulders before she shuffled closer. When their knees touched she stopped moving and Shinji thought she would soon start talking, but Asuka wasn't done surprising him. The touch of hair on his arm was his only warning as she leaned against him and rested her head on his shoulder. It was too dark but Shinji was sure he could envision a confident look on her face. As they sat there, Shinji could smell the scent of strawberries coming from her hair.

但他的问题并未得到回答；取而代之的是，一条毯子被抛到他肩上，随后她挪动着靠近。当他们的膝盖相触时，她停止了移动，真嗣以为她很快就会开口说话，但明日香还没让他惊讶完。手臂上发丝的触感是他唯一的预警，她靠向他，将头枕在他的肩上。尽管光线太暗，真嗣确信自己能想象出她脸上自信的表情。他们坐在那里，真嗣能闻到她头发散发出的草莓香味。

"Will you stop trembling," commanded Asuka.

"你能别发抖了吗，" 明日香命令道。

"I'm not the only one trembling," retorted Shinji.

"我不是唯一颤抖的人，"真嗣反驳道。

Asuka sighed and hugged her bear tighter. "Okay so I'm just as nervous. Now you see why we have so far to go." She felt Shinji tense. "We're not even comfortable being this close together in a normal setting. It's only when one of us is helping the other that we can be so close yet so calm."

明日香叹了口气，把她的熊抱得更紧了。"好吧，我承认我也同样紧张。现在你明白我们还有多远的路要走。"她感觉到真嗣的身体紧绷。"我们甚至在不寻常的环境中都无法舒适地靠近彼此。只有在帮助对方时，我们才能如此接近却又如此平静。"

"You're talking about that one time."

你在谈论那一次。

"Yes."

The two of them sat there in silence, trying to ignore the touch of the other, and waited. Shinji had finally shoved some of his perverted thoughts out of his mind and sifted through her words. Turning his head, he saw Asuka staring at him with a neutral expression. Moving with caution, he placed one hand on the girl’s knee as he tried to figure out the meaning behind her words or what he thought she was trying to say.

他们俩静静地坐在那里，试图忽略对方的触碰，等待着。真嗣终于将一些猥琐的想法赶出脑海，仔细琢磨她的话。他转过头，看到明日香正用中性的表情盯着他。他小心翼翼地把手放在女孩的膝盖上，试图理解她话语背后的含义，或者他认为她想要表达的意思。

"Asuka, you keep saying we have so far to go," he stated. "Also you told me that something might start. And at dinner you asked for a second chance to start over. What are you trying to say?"

明日香，你一直说我们还有很长的路要走，"他说道，"你还告诉我可能会有事情开始。晚餐时你又请求再给一次重新开始的机会。你到底想说什么？

Asuka sighed in frustration. "You can be so thick at times, you know, Shinji. Back during the Angels I would have called you stupid but I know you're not." She turned her body to face him. "You have been the one talking about us since I woke up. You changed so we could have a chance, to show me that you had changed. Shinji, you've told me that you regretted what happened between us during the Angels, that we hadn't been there for each other."

明日香无奈地叹了口气。"你知道吗，真嗣，有时候你真的很迟钝。在对抗使徒的时候，我可能会说你笨，但我知道你不是。"她转过身来面对他。"自从我醒来后，一直是你提起我们之间的事。你为了给我们一个机会而改变，向我展示你已经改变了。真嗣，你告诉我你后悔在对抗使徒期间我们之间发生的事，我们没有互相支持。"

"Asuka…" But Shinji was interrupted as Asuka took his head between her hands.

"明日香…" 但话未说完，真嗣就被明日香用双手捧住了脸。

"Shinji, I'm giving you the chance for us to be more than just friends. I want to be around you." She leaned in close until her hair brushed his neck. "But I need you to say those words. I need to hear that you're going to grab this chance to prove everything you told me wasn't empty words."

真嗣，我给你机会让我们不只是朋友。我想陪在你身边。" 她凑近了，直到发丝轻拂他的颈项。"但我需要你说出那句话。我需要听到你愿意抓住这个机会，证明你之前对我说的一切并非空话。

Shinji rolled his shoulders, freeing his body of the blanket. Reaching out, his fingers traced the smooth skin of her neck down to her shoulders. Sliding his arms under Asuka's, Shinji continued until he had reached her middle back. Gently he pulled her closer, hearing the sharp intake of breath from surprise. But he smiled as she followed his example and hugged back, both feeling the heartbeat of the other. Shinji moved one of his hands up letting his fingers glide through her hair.

真嗣耸了耸肩，挣脱了毯子的束缚。他伸出手，手指沿着她光滑的颈项滑至肩头。他双臂从明日香腋下滑过，继续前行直至触及她的后背中部。他温柔地将她拉近，听到她因惊讶而急促的吸气声。但他微笑着，因为她也依样画葫芦地回抱了他，两人都能感受到对方的心跳。真嗣将一只手移至上方，让手指轻抚过她的秀发。

"I suck at speeches, so I guess the easiest thing to do is say that I want to be around you too. I want to show you that you're not making a mistake, Asuka."

我不擅长演讲，所以我想最简单的方式就是告诉你，我也想陪在你身边。我想向你证明，你不会后悔选择我，明日香。

"Anything else to say?" Asuka asked as she leaned against him.

"还有什么要说的吗？" 明日香问道，同时靠在他身上。

"Just when I piss you off, which I know I'll do, that you remember I will always care about you, and not just because you're my girlfriend," Shinji stated quietly.

"就在我惹你生气的时候，我知道我会的，希望你能记住，我永远都会在乎你，不仅仅因为你是我的女朋友，" 碇真嗣轻声说道。

"And when I get angry at you, it doesn't mean I don't want you around anymore," She told him with a smile before pressing her lips against his for a moment. When she pulled back Asuka felt her cheeks heat up. “Thank you.”

"而当我对你生气时，并不意味着我不想你再在身边了，"她微笑着告诉他，随后轻轻地将自己的唇贴上他的唇片刻。当她退开时，明日香感到自己的脸颊发热。“谢谢你。”

With a little movement, Asuka forced Shinji down onto his back and rolled on top of him. They both squirmed around as they got comfortable under the blankets. It was with disappointment that she shifted to her side and slid off of Shinji but she quickly wrapped her arms around his neck. With a blush, he felt her smooth legs wrap around his, enjoying the silky feel of her skin, not unlike how she had felt back in the hospital. He knew it was her way to tell him that she was not going to let him go or didn't want him to leave. Smiling as they shared the pillow, Shinji had no trouble falling asleep this time.

稍作动作，明日香便让真嗣仰面躺下，自己则翻身压在他身上。两人在被窝里扭动着寻找舒适的姿势。带着一丝失望，她侧过身从真嗣身上滑下，但很快又用双臂环住了他的脖子。他脸颊泛红，感受到她光滑的双腿缠绕上来，享受着她肌肤如丝般的感觉，就像在医院时那样。他知道这是她表达不会让他离开，也不希望他走的方式。微笑着共用一个枕头，这次真嗣毫无困难地进入了梦乡。

Early October 2018 2018 年 10 月初

People think the role of Sub-commander is an easy one with going to cushy meetings and assigning duties so that the orders of the Commander were carried out. At the moment, all Misato wanted to do was shove the role onto someone else and get back to a normal life. But as she slid her card through the reader, she knew she couldn't do that and that she had taken on the responsibilities of her rank for some very good reasons. Still that didn't mean she liked the late night meetings or talking to UN officers, which she had been in for the last eight hours. Kicking off her shoes, she started walking through the living room.

人们认为副指挥官的职位轻松，只需参加舒适的会议并分配任务，以执行指挥官的命令。此刻，所有碇真嗣想做的就是将这个职位推给别人，回归正常生活。但当她将卡片滑过读卡器时，她知道自己不能这么做，她承担起自己的军衔责任是有充分理由的。尽管如此，这并不意味着她喜欢深夜会议或与联合国官员交谈，她已经连续八小时在做这些事了。踢掉鞋子，她开始穿过客厅。

That was, until a strange sight caught her attention on the floor in front of the television. All she could think was that it was two of the ugliest dens, nests or whatever she had ever seen. Blankets, pillows, and sheets were all woven into two joined mounds while takeout boxes were arrayed in a half-circle. Turning the television off, she approached one of the strange constructions and poked around with her foot until she hit something that felt like a body. Prodding only got groans so Misato increased the pressure until she got a louder response.

直到一个奇怪的景象吸引了她的注意，就在电视机前的地板上。她所能想到的，就是这是她见过的最丑陋的两个巢穴、窝或随便什么。毯子、枕头和床单都被编织成了两个相连的土堆，而外卖盒则排列成半圆形。关掉电视后，她走近其中一个奇怪的构造，用脚戳了戳，直到碰到一个感觉像是身体的东西。轻轻触碰只引来几声呻吟，于是 Misato 加大了力度，直到得到更响亮的回应。

"Ow!" exclaimed a girl. "哎哟！"一个女孩叫道。

Misato watched in amazement as a tangle of auburn hair rose vertically out of the mess. Asuka ran a hand through her hair, uncovering her face while she blinked the sleep out of her eyes. A hand covered her mouth as she yawned briefly before turning to stare at her guardian with puffy eyes. The woman frowned as Asuka slid up the strap on her blue tank top. She knew who was under there beside the girl and didn't know if she should take the two of them aside for a little talk or just let it go. After all, she had read the report of them in the hospital and what she had seen the morning after their date was more stunning than the current situation. Sighing to herself, she decided she wouldn't interfere, for now.

碇真嗣惊讶地看着一团赤褐色的头发从混乱中竖直升起。明日香用手梳理着头发，露出脸庞，同时眨着眼睛驱散睡意。一只手捂住嘴，她短暂地打了个哈欠，然后转过身，用肿胀的眼睛盯着她的监护人。女人皱起眉头，看着明日香拉起蓝色背心的肩带。她知道那里除了女孩还有谁，不知道是否应该把他们俩拉到一边进行一次小小的谈话，还是就此作罢。毕竟，她已经读过他们在医院的报告，以及他们约会后的第二天早上所见到的情景，那比当前的情况更令人震惊。她暗自叹了口气，决定暂时不干涉。

"What's the matter with you, Misato?" mumbled Asuka staring up at her.

"你这是怎么了，葛城？" 明日香嘟囔着，抬头望着她。

The woman realized she was frowning and smiled. "Nothing really. Did you two have a good night?"

那位女士意识到自己在皱眉，于是微笑起来。“没什么，你们俩昨晚过得好吗？”

"It was okay," replied Asuka before leaning back as Misato bent down. "What?"

“还可以吧，”明日香回答道，随后向后一靠，这时美里弯下腰来，“怎么了？”

"Is that a hickey?" she inquired.

"那是吻痕吗？"她问道。

Asuka looked down where Misato was pointing and saw a mark barely covered by her shirt. Pushing her shirt off to the side, Asuka stared in horror for a few quiet moments. With angry scowl, she raised her fist and brought it down hard on the lump next to her. And repeated doing so until Shinji came up beside her. Looking at her scowl, he attempted to duck back down but she caught him. Misato watched in amusement as the redhead brought her face within inches of his.

明日香顺着美里所指的方向低头看去，发现一个几乎被衬衫遮住的痕迹。她将衬衫推到一边，惊恐地凝视了片刻。带着愤怒的皱眉，她举起拳头，用力砸向身旁的隆起处，并反复这样做，直到真嗣走到她身边。看着她的怒容，他试图再次蹲下，但她抓住了他。美里饶有兴致地看着红发少女将脸贴近他的脸。

"I told you that you could hold me," Asuka growled. "But I said nothing of sucking on me or trying to draw blood."

我告诉过你，你可以抓住我，" 明日香咆哮道，"但我没说过你可以吸吮我或试图吸我的血。

"But I didn't do anything Asuka. I just held you like I promised," explained Shinji before he saw Misato. "It's not what you think it was."

“但我什么也没做，明日香。我只是像承诺的那样抱着你，” 碇真嗣在看到葛城美里之前解释道，“事情并非你所想的那样。”

"So you just held me and did nothing else," Asuka stated. "Then what is that?"

“所以你就只是抱着我，没做别的，”明日香说道，“那这是什么？”

Shinji found his head being forced lower until he saw a bluish mark on Asuka's creamy skin. "Is that what you're talking about?" He giggled.

真嗣感到自己的头被压得更低，直到他看见明日香奶油般肌肤上的淡蓝色印记。“你说的就是这个吗？”他咯咯笑道。

"Yes, and what's so funny?" she demanded.

"是的，有什么这么好笑？" 她质问道。

"Nothing, except." Shinji licked his finger and wiped the mark off before tasting it. "Thought so."

“没什么，除了……” 真嗣舔了舔手指，擦去痕迹后尝了尝，“果然如此。”

Asuka felt her face heat up. "You'd better explain fast, Shinji."

明日香感到自己的脸颊发烫。“你最好快点解释，真嗣。”

He didn't say anything, instead digging around in Asuka’s pile. She shifted as his hand brushed her leg as he grabbed something she had been sitting on. With a triumphant smile, he pulled his find up so the females could see what he was holding. Misato couldn't understand what a package of candy had to do with anything as Asuka turned a darker shade of red. Shinji also wouldn't meet Misato's eyes, instead concentrating on Asuka's face.

他一言不发，转而在明日香的物品堆里翻找。当他的手触碰到她的大腿，从她坐着的物品中抓起某样东西时，她微微挪动了一下。他带着得意的微笑，举起手中的发现，让在场的女性都能看清他握着的是什么。美里不解一包糖果与这情景有何关联，而明日香的脸色愈发绯红。真嗣也避开了美里的目光，专注地凝视着明日香的脸庞。

"Remember what we were doing last night with all the candy?" he asked.

“还记得昨晚我们和那些糖果一起做的事吗？”他问道。

Asuka nodded her head, her anger turning to embarrassment. "Yes."

明日香点了点头，怒气转为尴尬。“是的。”

"I'm sure if you had looked carefully…"

"我确信如果你仔细看的话……"

"Quiet!" Asuka hissed, her eyes darting to Misato.

"安静！" 明日香低声说道，目光迅速投向了美里。

Their roommate picked up on the signal and decided to ignore it, like she had done with a lot of recent events. Leaving the two blushing teens, she went into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee for the two of them. Sticking her head back out the kitchen opening, she saw the pilots adjusting their clothing before each picked up a box of leftovers. She smiled as they walked past her into the kitchen and sat down after each grabbed a fork. Her smile faded as she thought of how she was going to break the news to the two of them. What she had to say could break Asuka again and she was doing so well with Shinji and her friends. Nothing was said between the roommates until Misato slid two cups to the teens and placed her briefcase on the table.

室友察觉到了信号，却决定置之不理，就像她对最近许多事情的处理方式一样。她留下那两位脸红的少年，走进厨房为他们煮了一壶咖啡。探头从厨房门口望去，她看到飞行员们正整理着装，随后各自拿起一盒剩菜。他们经过她身边走进厨房，坐下后各自抓起一把叉子，她微笑着。但当她想到要如何向他们透露那个消息时，笑容逐渐消失。她的话可能会再次击垮明日香，而明日香与真嗣及朋友们相处得那么好。直到美里将两杯咖啡推到少年们面前，并把公文包放在桌上，室友们之间才没有言语交流。

"Asuka." The girl looked at Misato. "I have something to ask of you."

“明日香。”女孩看着美里。“我有事想拜托你。”

"And what is that?" "那是什么？"

Misato swallowed and opened the briefcase. "The United Nations has been inquiring as to when we were going to test you to see if you could still pilot."

美里咽了咽口水，打开了公文包。"联合国一直在询问我们何时会测试你，看你是否还能驾驶。"

"Misato!" exclaimed Shinji, rising to his feet. "How could they ask that of her?"

真嗣惊呼道：“美里！他们怎么能这样要求她？”

"They have a substantial amount of money tied up with all the EVAs. Also, they have been paying both your salaries, and if Asuka can't pilot, they’ll retire her and place Unit-02 in stasis." Misato explained. "Now I have been successful in…"

他们有大量的资金与所有的 EVA 绑定。此外，他们一直在支付你们两人的薪水，如果明日香不能驾驶，他们将让她退役，并将零号机封存。" 美里解释道，"现在我已经成功地……

"That's not the point and you know it!" Shinji slammed his hands onto the table.

"那不是重点，你也清楚！" 真嗣猛地将双手拍在桌子上。

"Shinji, sit down!"

Neither of the two arguing NERV officers was paying attention to the third person sitting at the table. Asuka sat there quietly, holding her mug between her hands and staring at the tabletop. She didn't even hear the argument that was going on between Shinji and Misato, as she was lost in her own thoughts. She knew this request would have come sooner or later though she had been hoping for later. Her mother and past were still a part of her that she just couldn't throw away. She hadn't even told Shinji anything, against Doctor Leibling's suggestion, fearing that he wasn't ready to know.

两位争执中的 NERV 官员都没有注意到坐在桌边的第三个人。明日香静静地坐在那里，双手捧着杯子，凝视着桌面。她甚至没有听到真嗣和美里之间的争吵，因为她沉浸在自己的思绪中。她知道这个请求迟早会来，尽管她希望晚些时候。她的母亲和过去仍然是她无法抛弃的一部分。她甚至没有按照莱布林博士的建议告诉真嗣任何事情，因为她担心他还没有准备好知道。

"Shinji," whispered the redhead. "Please don't argue with Misato."

真嗣，"红发女孩低声说道，"请不要和美里争论。

"Asuka?" Shinji could only sit down in panic as she looked at him with pleading eyes. "Fine."

Asuka?" 当她用恳求的眼神看着他时，Shinji 只能惊慌地坐下。"好吧。

She waited until Shinji had taken his seat before turning to her commanding officer. "When is the synchronization test?"

她等到真嗣坐下后，才转向她的指挥官问道："同步测试什么时候进行？"

Misato frowned at the complete calm evident in Asuka's voice. "There's no need to rush things."

碇真嗣愤怒地问道：“她要学所有的东西吗？”

"Is she going to learn everything?" asked Shinji angrily.

明日香声音中显露出的完全平静让美里皱起了眉头。“没有必要急于求成。”

"Yes."

"What are you talking about?" Asuka asked the two of them.

"你们在说什么？" 明日香向他们两人问道。

"Before you agree to pilot again you have to learn the complete truth about your Evangelion and your mother." Misato slid a file to the middle of the table. "Only after you know everything do we want your response."

在你同意再次驾驶之前，你必须了解关于你的福音战士和你母亲的全部真相。" 美里将一份文件推到桌子中央。"只有在了解一切之后，我们才需要你的答复。

With that said, Misato stood and, ignoring how white Asuka's face had gone, left the kitchen. The room was quiet for a few minutes, as neither Shinji nor Asuka moved or spoke. A scrapping sound was heard as Shinji moved his chair next Asuka before reaching out to grab her mug. Dumping the coffee out, he filled it with milk instead and placed it in front of Asuka before sitting again. Drinking from his own mug, he watched as her chin rested on her chest and auburn hair hung limply, obscuring her face. With a shaky breath she turned to face him.

说完这些，Misato 站起身来，无视 Asuka 苍白的脸色，离开了厨房。房间里静默了几分钟，Shinji 和 Asuka 都没有动也没有说话。随着 Shinji 将椅子挪到 Asuka 旁边，一阵刮擦声响起，他伸手拿起她的杯子，倒掉咖啡，换成牛奶后放在她面前，然后再次坐下。他喝着自己的咖啡，看着她的下巴抵在胸前，赤褐色的头发无力地垂下，遮住了她的脸。她深吸一口气，颤抖着转向他。

"How bad was your report?"

你的报告有多糟？

Shinji closed his eyes. "It wasn't good. I never wanted to believe that humans could do such things to each other." He reached out and took her hand in his. "But it answered a lot of questions."

真嗣闭上了眼睛。“那并不好。我从未想过人类会对彼此做出这样的事。”他伸出手，握住了她的手。“但这解答了很多疑问。”

"Do you think I should read mine?"

“你觉得我应该看我的吗？”

"I can't answer that question."

我无法回答那个问题。

"Shinji," she pleaded. "Out of everyone I know, you know me the best. Based on everything you know about me do you think reading that…" she gestured to the file. "would be in my best interest?"

真嗣，" 她恳求道，"在我认识的所有人中，你最了解我。基于你对我的了解，你认为阅读那份文件……" 她指向文件，"对我最有利吗？

Shinji thought on that, evenly divided between protecting Asuka and letting her face the pain. He had told the truth when he had said that reading the file on his mother and Unit 01 had cleared up a lot of his questions. What he hadn't told her was the pain he had felt getting those answers and learning about his father's involvement with his mother. With sorrow he looked up and stared into eyes filled with doubt.

真嗣在思考，内心矛盾地徘徊在保护明日香和让她面对痛苦之间。他确实说过，阅读关于他母亲和零号机的文件解答了他许多疑问。但他没有告诉她的是，获取这些答案以及了解父亲与母亲之间关系的痛苦。他带着悲伤抬头，凝视着充满疑虑的双眼。

"Yes."

The next night 第二天晚上

Shinji wished he had not told Asuka to read the report. Her body lay limply in his arms as they shared her bed, but it wasn’t like the past few times. Her eyes had barely opened in the last hours and when they did, they were blank, which scared Shinji. Her head rested on his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart, finding strange comfort in it. Her eyes popped open as Shinji ran his fingers through her hair before coming to rest on her shoulder.

真嗣希望自己没有告诉明日香去读那份报告。她的身体无力地躺在他的怀里，共享着她的床，但与前几次不同。她的眼睛在过去几小时里几乎没有睁开过，偶尔睁开时也是空洞无神，这让真嗣感到害怕。她的头靠在他的胸膛上，聆听着他平稳的心跳，从中找到了一种奇怪的安慰。当真嗣用手指梳理她的头发，然后手落在她的肩膀上时，她的眼睛突然睁开了。

"Have you ever been chained to something when you want to be free?" she murmured, propping herself up on one elbow.

"你有没有试过被束缚在某物上，而你渴望自由？" 她喃喃自语，用一只手肘撑起身体。

"You're talking about EVA?"

你在谈论 EVA 吗？

"Of course I'm talking about EVA!" Asuka shifted until she straddled Shinji. She lost the scowl as he smiled up at her. "It's been part of my life and has controlled it for what seems like forever."

当然我是在谈论 EVA！" 明日香挪动身体，跨坐在真嗣身上。她脸上的怒容消失了，因为真嗣正对她微笑。"它一直是我生活的一部分，似乎永远都在掌控着我的生活。

"What about college? Did EVA affect that too?" Shinji kept his eyes firmly on Asuka’s face after a glance down her shirt where her firm breasts hung freely and exposed.

"那大学呢？EVA 也影响到那方面了吗？" 碇真嗣在瞥了一眼明日香衬衫下自由垂挂的坚挺胸部后，目光坚定地停留在她的脸上。

"In a way since my past and EVA are connected. Going to school was just one more thing to prove I was the best," she admitted. "Yet now I have a chance to be free but I'm not going to grab it."

某种程度上是的，因为我的过去和 EVA 有关联。去学校只是为了证明我是最优秀的，" 她承认道，"但现在我有机会自由了，我却不想抓住它。

Shinji tensed at that statement. "So you're going to pilot?"

听到那句话，真嗣紧张起来。“所以你要驾驶吗？”

"Yes." She lowered herself, her hair brushing his neck and face. "But I have other things I want to accomplish."

“是的。”她俯下身，头发轻拂过他的脖子和脸颊。“但我还有其他想完成的事情。”

He pulled her down until she was on top of him again. "And will you share those thoughts with me?"

他把她拉下来，直到她再次趴在他身上。"你会和我分享这些想法吗？"

Asuka smiled as she felt Shinji tremble as she kissed her way up his neck. "One of them concerns space."

明日香微笑着，感觉到真嗣在她沿着他的脖子亲吻时颤抖。"其中一个想法与太空有关。"

"A-a-and the other?" stammered Shinji as her warm moist lips made contact with his cheek.

"还、还有其他的吗？" 碇真嗣结巴着问道，她的温润双唇轻触他的脸颊。

"That's for the future." 那是留给未来的。

Shinji slumped further into the pillows and stared at the girl who was lying on him. "Have I told you how beautiful you are?"

真嗣更深地陷进枕头里，凝视着躺在他身上的女孩。“我有没有告诉过你，你有多美？”

"Yes." Asuka grinned at him savagely, seeing a way to get away from the sad thoughts. "But it’s always good to remind me about that fact. And speaking of you telling me I’m beautiful, it’s been two weeks since you told me."

是的。" 明日香狰狞地对他笑了笑，找到了逃离悲伤思绪的方法。"但总提醒我这一点总是好的。说到你告诉我我很美，你已经两周没这么说了。

"Sorry, it's just that..." Shinji tried to squirm away but she planted her fists into his shoulder joints and put all her weight on them.

"对不起，只是……" 真嗣试图挣脱，但她将拳头抵在他的肩关节上，全身重量都压了上去。

"You think a simple sorry is going to be enough?" She grinned at his discomfort. "I might take it the wrong way and think you don't think I'm attractive." Asuka leaned closer. "So am I attractive or should I strip for you?"

你以为一句简单的对不起就够了吗？" 她看着他尴尬的样子咧嘴笑了。"我可能会误会，以为你认为我不吸引人。" 明日香靠得更近了。"那我吸引你吗，还是需要我脱衣服给你看？

"No! I mean yes! You're really attractive and beautiful. It's just that you haven't gone shopping lately." He swallowed at her smile. "I thought if I complimented you too much you'd think I was staring, being perverted or just rude."

不！我是说，是的！你真的很迷人，很美。只是你最近没怎么去购物。"他咽了口口水，面对她的微笑。"我担心如果我过分赞美你，你会觉得我在盯着你看，要么是变态，要么就是无礼。

"How is complimenting me on my looks rude? Staring is fine, it's leering that I don't like and you haven't done that.” She released Shinji and immediately fell on top of him. "And I know how to remedy that lack of shopping." She heard him groan. "No whining, I promise you'll enjoy it."

赞美我的外表怎么就无礼了？盯着看可以，我不喜欢的是那种色眯眯的眼神，而你并没有那样做。”她松开真嗣，立刻扑倒在他身上。"而且我知道怎么解决那个购物不足的问题。"她听到他呻吟。"别抱怨，我保证你会喜欢的。

"You females are weird. I can never understand your fascination with shopping."

你们女性真奇怪。我永远无法理解你们对购物的迷恋。

"I think the word you're searching for is mysterious. And besides what fun would it be if I was predictable?"

我觉得你找的那个词是‘神秘’。而且，如果我变得可预测，那还有什么乐趣呢？

Mid November 2018

With a gasp, Asuka's head broke the surface of the water and she relaxed back in the tub. Reaching back, she ran her fingers through her hair, feeling no coating of LCL on it. Now that she was piloting again, it took much more time to take care of her hair. Closing her eyes, she let her body soak in the hot water, the stress and tension melting away as the minutes passed. Smiling faintly, she envisioned what Shinji's reaction would be if he could see her at that moment.

伴随着一声喘息，明日香的头冲破水面，她放松地靠在浴缸里。伸手往后，她用手指梳理着头发，没有感觉到 LCL 的粘腻。如今再次驾驶，她打理头发的时间多了许多。闭上眼睛，她让身体沉浸在热水中，随着时间的流逝，压力和紧张感逐渐消融。她微微一笑，想象着如果真嗣此刻能看到她，会是怎样的反应。

Creamy white skin flushed pink from heat and excitement while her auburn hair draped over pale shoulders. Sitting up, she cupped her breasts in her hands, letting her fingers trace over the smooth, firm flesh and brush against her nipples. Letting go of her breasts, she leaned back and brought her legs back together, while thoughts wandered through her mind. Oh yeah, she knew what Shinji's reaction would have been, all she had to do was remember what had happened at the hospital. The feeling of his erection pressing against her body, also how nice it had felt to be held, had brought forth various feelings and emotions that she had thought she would never experience. Not that they had been wrong, just weird. In fact his reaction had only encouraged her to push faster than before, like she wanted to experience those feelings again.

奶油般白皙的肌肤因热度和兴奋而泛起粉红，她的赤褐色秀发披散在苍白的肩上。坐起身来，她双手捧着自己的乳房，让手指轻抚那光滑结实的肌肤，轻触乳头。放开乳房，她向后仰靠，双腿并拢，思绪在脑海中游走。哦，是的，她知道真嗣会有什么反应，只需回想医院里发生的事就明白了。他的勃起紧贴她身体的感觉，以及被拥抱的舒适感，唤起了她以为自己永远不会体验到的各种情感。并非那些感觉是错的，只是有些奇怪。事实上，他的反应只是鼓励她比以往更急切地前进，仿佛她渴望再次体验那些感觉。

"Asuka, Asuka, Asuka what are you thinking?" she muttered.

"明日香，明日香，你在想什么呢？" 她喃喃自语。

Shaking her head, she lifted one of her legs out of the water and ran a critical eye over it. She followed the various curves and lines from her petite toes, down over a rounded calf, letting her eyes skip her knee before following a toned thigh back into the water. Frowning she bent her leg and drew it closer, allowing her hands to trace over her skin, feeling for any abnormalities. It wasn't until she was done with her other leg that the frown disappeared when she didn’t find any stubble, cuts, or scars on her pristine body. She knew the only scar on her body was across her left wrist, something she tried to avoid looking at as much as possible. Standing, she let the water flow off her curves then slipped her feet into shower shoes before wrapping a towel around her hair and sliding into a cotton robe to exit the bathroom.

她摇了摇头，从水中抬起一条腿，用挑剔的眼光审视着。她顺着小巧的脚趾，沿着圆润的小腿，目光跳过膝盖，再顺着紧实的大腿回到水中。皱着眉，她弯曲那条腿，将其拉近，双手在肌肤上轻抚，探寻着任何异常。直到检查完另一条腿，眉头才舒展开来，因为她并未在洁净的身躯上发现任何胡茬、割伤或疤痕。她清楚，自己身上唯一的疤痕横在左腕，那是她尽可能避免直视的地方。站起身，任水珠从曲线滑落，她穿上浴室拖鞋，用毛巾裹住头发，再披上棉质浴袍，步出了浴室。

An hour later, Asuka was rummaging through her closet and dresser, trying to put together what she was going to wear to the party that night. Taking a green pleated skirt from its hanger, she placed it on her bed with her other selections. She stood there with her hands on her hips, tapping her foot in annoyance as she stared at the various articles of clothing from slacks to dresses to T-shirts that lay next to expensive blouses. Flipping her hair out of the way in frustration, she went back into her closet and grabbed more clothes before storming back to the bed. Grimacing, she went to work.

一小时后，明日香正在她的衣柜和抽屉里翻找，试图决定晚上派对要穿什么。她从衣架上取下一条绿色百褶裙，将其与其他挑选出的衣物一起放在床上。她双手叉腰站在那里，不耐烦地跺着脚，盯着旁边从长裤到裙子再到 T 恤的各种衣物，以及昂贵的衬衫。她烦躁地将头发甩到一边，又回到衣柜里抓了更多衣服，然后气冲冲地回到床边。她皱着眉头，开始动手整理。

"Asuka."

The girl jumped and turned around to see Misato sliding the door closed. She turned around and grabbed the green skirt. "Ever hear of knocking?"

女孩跳起来转身，看到美里正把门关上。她转过身，抓起那条绿色裙子。“你听说过敲门吗？”

Misato waited until Asuka turned around to face her again. "I did. Three times."

碇真嗣等到明日香再次转过身来面对她时才说：“我做了。三次。”

"Obviously it wasn’t loud enough," Asuka muttered under her breath as she placed a white blouse with a blue skirt. Shaking her head at the combination, she put the shirt with a pair of khaki shorts. "So what'd you want?"

“显然声音不够大，”明日香低声嘟囔着，一边拿起一件白衬衫搭配蓝裙子。她对这组合摇了摇头，又将衬衫换成了卡其色短裤。“那你想要什么？”

"To talk."

"So why aren't you talking?"

那你为什么不开口说话呢？

Misato watched Asuka shift something again. "Will you stop that and look at me?"

美里看着明日香再次挪动某物。“你能停下来，看着我吗？”

The teen huffed and turned around to face Misato, who crossed the room and sat down on the desk. Asuka ignored the motion to join her and remained standing with her arms crossed. She smirked at how uncomfortable Misato was, knowing what had caused it.

少女哼了一声，转身面对美里，后者穿过房间坐在桌子上。明日香无视了加入她的动作，依旧站着，双臂交叉。她对美里感到不适的样子露出了一丝坏笑，心里清楚是什么原因造成的。

"Can you put some clothes on?" requested Misato.

米萨托请求道：“你能穿些衣服吗？”

"I am dressed." 我已经穿好了。

"Most people wouldn't consider a bra and panties as being dressed."

大多数人不会认为只穿胸罩和内裤算是穿好了衣服。

"It's my room, so I'll wear what I want," retorted Asuka. She smiled to herself as the conversation usually revolved around what her guardian wore.

"这是我的房间，所以我想穿什么就穿什么，"飞鸟反驳道。她暗自微笑，因为对话通常围绕着她的监护人穿什么展开。

"And what if Shinji walked in right now?" Misato asked, steering the conversation.

"如果真嗣现在走进来会怎样？" 美里引导着对话问道。

Asuka smirked. "He isn't home right now and if he did walk in, I'm sure he would appreciate my choice of clothing."

明日香咧嘴一笑，"他现在不在家，就算他真的走进来，我相信他也会欣赏我的着装选择。"

"I'm sure he would," replied Misato dryly. "Speaking of Shinji, how is he?"

我确信他会这么做，" 渚薰干巴巴地回答道，"说到真嗣，他怎么样了？

"He's fine," stated the redhead, ignoring the double meaning of her guardian's statement.

"他很好，" 红发女孩说道，忽略了她的监护人话语中的双关意味。

"That's nice to hear." Misato started tracing circles on her leg. "Having any trouble with your relationship?"

听到这个真好。" 碇真嗣开始在腿上画圈。"你们的关系有什么问题吗？

"So that's what you wanted to talk about." Asuka saw the woman blush. "It's coming along nicely."

原来这就是你想谈的。" 明日香看到那个女人脸红了。"进展得很顺利。

Misato nodded and looked at the floor, lost in thought. She questioned if she really needed to be here lecturing Asuka about something that wasn’t any of her business. But it was her business, since they were her children even if it was just legally. She had to make sure the girl understood the ramifications of some of her actions. Though she did know how the teen was going to react to what she was going to bring up.

碇真嗣点了点头，目光落在地板上，陷入了沉思。她质疑自己是否真的需要在这里对明日香进行说教，毕竟这本不关她的事。但这是她的责任，因为即使只是法律上的关系，他们也是她的孩子。她必须确保这个女孩理解她某些行为的后果。尽管她确实知道这个青少年对即将提出的问题会有什么反应。

"You do know what happens when two people are attracted to each other?" Misato started. "Especially teenagers."

你知道当两个人相互吸引时会发生什么吗？" 碇真嗣开始说道，"尤其是青少年。

"You think we're moving too fast, right?"

你觉得我们进展太快了，对吧？

"What else am I supposed to think?" Misato asked. "You two have shared a bed half a dozen times since you've woken up. I know about what happened in the hospital and I found you two in Shinji's bed after your…" She stared at Asuka who was chuckling. "What's so funny?"

那我还能怎么想呢？" 葛城美里问道。"自从你醒来后，你们俩已经共用一张床好几次了。我知道医院里发生的事，还有我在你……" 她盯着明日香，后者正在咯咯笑。"有什么好笑的？

"Just that you've jumped to conclusions, like I did." The teen finally moved over to her bed and sat down. "If you know about the hospital then you know what really happened." She glared at Misato. "If you hadn't ordered him to stay home, it would never have happened."

只是因为你已经下了结论，就像我当初那样。" 少女最终走到床边坐下，"既然你知道医院的事，那你应该清楚真正发生了什么。" 她瞪着 Misato，"如果你没有命令他留在家里，这一切都不会发生。

"But…"

"And after our date I went to ask him if he wanted to become more than just friends…"

在我们约会之后，我去问他是否愿意超越朋友关系……

"So you two are a couple," interrupted Misato.

"所以你们俩是一对，" 碇真嗣插话道。

"You just figured that out! Of course we are!" Asuka snapped. "What did you think the meaning of a relationship was, sleeping together and nothing else?"

你才明白啊！当然是我们！"飞鸟厉声说道。"你以为关系的意义是什么，只是睡在一起而没有其他吗？

"That's what it usually leads to, and I don't have to remind you how young both of you are." She watched Asuka start to blush. "You haven't! Have you?"

通常这就是结果，而且我不需要提醒你，你们俩都还这么年轻。" 她看着明日香开始脸红。"你们还没……你们真的没有吗？

"No!" Asuka glanced at the floor. "We haven't done anything because it's too soon for both of us. Our sleeping in the same bed, going out as much as possible and holding each other is making up for our pasts." She looked up and smiled. "It's nice to feel Shinji hold me in his arms. It makes me happy and comfortable that someone cares enough to hold me close. And Shinji likes being around me so I do things that encourage him to stay close, though I really don't have to. But sex…" The girl shook her head. "We're not ready. I’m not ready for something that serious."

没有！" 飞鸟瞥了一眼地板。 "我们什么都没做，因为对我们俩来说还太早了。我们睡在同一张床上，尽可能多地出去，互相拥抱，这弥补了我们的过去。" 她抬头微笑。 "被真嗣抱在怀里感觉很好。有人足够关心我，把我紧紧抱在怀里，这让我感到幸福和舒适。而真嗣喜欢和我在一起，所以我做些事情鼓励他靠近我，尽管我其实不必这么做。但是性…" 女孩摇了摇头。 "我们还没准备好。我还没准备好接受那么严肃的事情。

"Don't you love him?" 难道你不爱他吗？

“Yes, a lot!” Asuka stated, nodding her head. "It's complicated though, Misato. The true love, the kind that soul mates feel for each other, where they can give all of themselves, both body and soul, without worry is about here." She gestured at her shoulders. "Shinji and I, we're about here." This time the location was at chest level. "The thing is, I know what I want and what I’m getting out of our relationship but Shinji hasn't told me anything. All he's said is that he changed because he wanted there to be an us."

“是的，非常爱！” 明日香说道，点了点头。“但这很复杂，美里。真正的爱，那种灵魂伴侣之间的感觉，他们可以毫无保留地给予对方，包括身体和灵魂，不用担心，大概是这样的。” 她指了指自己的肩膀。“我和真嗣，我们大概在这里。” 这次位置在胸前。“问题是，我知道我想要什么，以及我能从我们的关系中得到什么，但真嗣什么也没告诉我。他只说他因为想有我们而改变了。”

"Isn't that enough, Asuka?" Misato shifted around on the desk. What she had just heard from the girl had amazed her. Most people never gave that kind of thought to relationships or love. Usually if it happened, people were grateful. Yet here was a teen, who had never known love, giving a complicated situation a simple explanation. Asuka wasn't about to do something unless she fully loved a person and that person loved her.

"这还不够吗，明日香？" 葛城美里在桌子上挪动了一下位置。她刚刚从女孩那里听到的话让她感到惊讶。大多数人从未对关系或爱情有过这样的思考。通常如果发生了，人们会感激。然而，这里有一个从未体验过爱的少女，对一个复杂的情况给出了简单的解释。明日香不会去做任何事情，除非她完全爱一个人，而那个人也爱她。

"No. It's not enough. If our relationship is one-sided then we'll never succeed at love. Shinji has to be getting something out of our relationship or it wouldn't be worth his time." Asuka lay back and put her hands behind her head. "That's why if he wants to go out with his friends, I let him. If he wants to be alone for a while, I'll give him that time. I won't give him a stupid reason to end it before it's even begun, yet I need to hear that reason to be reassured."

不，这还不够。如果我们的关系是单方面的，那么我们在爱情上永远不会成功。真嗣必须从我们的关系中得到些什么，否则这对他来说就不值得花时间。" 明日香躺下，将双手放在脑后。"这就是为什么如果他想和朋友出去，我让他去。如果他想独处一会儿，我会给他那个时间。我不会给他一个愚蠢的理由在开始之前就结束，但我需要听到那个理由来感到安心。

"What if it's just sex?" Misato rebuked herself for thinking that Shinji would be like that. "Asuka, I didn't..."

如果只是性关系呢？" 碇真嗣这样想，自己都感到惊讶。"明日香，我并没有……

"It's not like that and you know it," Asuka retorted. "If Shinji was like that he wouldn’t have waited around for me."

事情不是你想的那样，你知道的，" 明日香反驳道。"如果碇真嗣是那种人，他就不会一直等我了。

The redhead fell silent with that comment and stared up at the ceiling, knowing what she had said was true. The gestures, the little touches, the emotions he wore openly all pointed to a young man who wanted more out of a relationship. The most important thing was he had chosen her for some reason and she wanted to know what it was. Turning her head, she watched Misato as she sat there chewing on her lower lip and trying to get comfortable. Asuka knew the woman had something else on her mind.

红发女孩因那番话陷入了沉默，凝视着天花板，知道她所说的是真的。那些小动作，轻轻的触碰，他毫不掩饰的情感，都指向了一个渴望从关系中得到更多的年轻人。最重要的是，他出于某种原因选择了她，而她想知道那是什么。她转过头，看着坐在那里咬着下唇试图让自己舒服的葛城。明日香知道这个女人心里还有别的事。

"Have you thought about it?" Misato asked, while watching the girl.

"你考虑过吗？" 渚薰问道，同时注视着那个女孩。

"Sex?" Asuka felt her face heat up, remembering what had been going through her head in the tub.

"性吗？" 明日香感到自己的脸颊发烫，回想起在浴缸里脑海中掠过的念头。

Misato saw the blush, nodding to herself. "What else would I be referring to, Asuka?"

美里看到了那抹红晕，暗自点头。"我还能指什么呢，明日香？"

"I just told you, we're…"

我刚告诉过你，我们……

"I'm being serious, Asuka. Now please answer the question."

我是认真的，明日香。现在请回答问题。

"Fine," Asuka pouted. "I have thought about it, okay. Wondering what it feels like, what kind of emotions I'll feel during it. I’m a healthy teenage girl after all." She turned her back to Misato. "Can we drop it now?"

好吧，" 明日香噘嘴说，"我已经考虑过了，行了吧。我在想那会是什么感觉，我会感受到什么样的情绪。毕竟我是个健康的少女。" 她转过身背对渚薰，"我们现在能不谈这个了吗？

Misato stood up and went over to where Asuka lay. Kneeling down, she placed a hand on a bare shoulder. "Then you also know how fast things can change. A kiss that lasts too long or embraces that lead to something more involved. There are many things that can push you to the act."

碇真嗣站起身，走向明日香躺着的地方。跪下后，她将手放在裸露的肩膀上。“那么你也知道事情变化得有多快。一个吻持续太久，或是拥抱导致更深入的接触。有很多事情能促使你采取行动。”

"No." Asuka reached up to touch Misato. "No matter how frustrating it'll get, I'm going to wait."

“不。”明日香伸手触碰碇真嗣。“无论多么令人沮丧，我都会等待。”

"Still you have to acknowledge that it could happen."

你仍然必须承认，这有可能发生。

Asuka rolled her eyes, annoyed. "Yes, it could happen but it won't."

明日香翻了个白眼，有些恼火地说：“是的，这可能发生，但它不会发生。”

Misato slowly released her breath, finally reaching what she had originally come to talk to Asuka about. "Then you'll understand what I'm talking about when I say that I want you to go on birth control."

碇真嗣缓缓地吐出一口气，终于谈到了她原本想和明日香讨论的话题。“那么，当你听到我说希望你开始服用避孕药时，你应该能理解我的意思。”

Asuka shot to her feet, almost knocking Misato to the floor. She stared at Misato with wide eyes at what she had just heard. Not since being told that she could no longer pilot during the Angels had she heard something so outrageous. It was only made worse because she trusted Misato, she was like a mother to her. Closing her eyes, she leaned against the wall, trying to calm herself down. When she finally opened them they were full of anger and pain.

明日香猛地站起身来，差点把碇真嗣撞倒。她睁大眼睛盯着碇真嗣，对刚才听到的话感到震惊。自从被告知不能再驾驶对抗使徒的机体以来，她从未听过如此荒谬的事情。更糟糕的是，她信任碇真嗣，她就像她的母亲一样。她闭上眼睛，靠在墙上，试图让自己平静下来。当她最终睁开眼睛时，眼中充满了愤怒和痛苦。

"What did you say?" Asuka asked in a low, deadly tone.

"你说什么？"明日香低沉而致命地问道。

"I want you to go on birth control."

我希望你开始服用避孕药。

"That's what I thought you said." Asuka smirked but it was without humor. "I refuse, Misato."

“我就知道你是这么说的。”明日香冷笑一声，却毫无笑意，“我拒绝，葛城。”

"It's for your own good!" protested Misato.

"这是为你好！" 美里抗议道。

"It's my body, and I'll decide what happens to it." She leaned closer to Misato. "When I finally have sex it'll be on my terms. I will live with my decisions because I'm the only one who can make them."

这是我的身体，我有权决定它的命运。" 她向碇真嗣靠近了一些。"当我最终决定发生性关系时，那将是在我的条件之下。我会为自己的决定负责，因为只有我才能做出这些决定。

"But…"

"Don’t you trust me to do the right thing, Misato?" Asuka asked quietly, her anger gone. “I know I’m not ready to have children but you have to trust me to make my own decisions. I’m not a child anymore.”

难道你不相信我会做出正确的选择吗，碇真嗣？" 明日香轻声问道，她的怒气已经消散。"我知道我现在还不准备要孩子，但你必须相信我能自己做出决定。我已经不是小孩子了。

The older woman closed her eyes, knowing what the teen was getting at with the issue of trust. “I do trust you, Asuka, and I’m sorry. I should have asked you instead of demanding that of you.”

那位年长的女士闭上眼睛，明白这位少女在信任问题上所指。“我确实信任你，明日香，对不起。我本应该询问你，而不是强求你。”

“Yes, you should’ve asked me.”

“是的，你本应该问我。”

“Still…”

“I’ll think about, Misato.”

“我会考虑的，碇。”

- - - -

"Asuka!"

The girl turned at the sound of her name, seeing Shinji coming up behind her, a block from their destination. She had been lost in thought at the embarrassing conversation that had taken place with Misato. Even a half-hour later she felt the heat in her cheeks when she kept hearing the words, birth control, in her mind. How could Misato have even thought to bring up that topic was beyond her. Smiling, she turned to Shinji, letting her mind shift to the coming evening and party. Reaching out, she took his hand in hers after a quick hug from the boy.

女孩听到自己的名字转过身，看到真嗣从后面赶来，离目的地还有一街区。她刚才陷入了与碇的尴尬对话的沉思中。即使半小时后，她仍感到脸颊发热，脑海中不断回响着“避孕”这个词。碇怎么会想到提起这个话题，她实在无法理解。她微笑着转向真嗣，让思绪转向即将到来的夜晚和派对。在男孩快速拥抱后，她伸出手握住了他的手。

"You look nice," commented Shinji, rubbing his nose.

"你看起来不错，" 真嗣评论道，揉了揉鼻子。

"These are just plain clothes, nothing special."

这些只是普通的衣服，没什么特别的。

He shook his head but didn't say a word. He didn't think the dark blue mini-skirt with black pantyhose and a light peach colored blouse were plain. Learning to tell Asuka the truth when it came to her looks or clothes had been a painful, yet interesting experience. Their many trips to the mall had taught him that plain for her didn't translate into plain for him. Plain meant jeans and a T-shirt to his sense of style or lack thereof as she reminded him. He spun around as she stopped and yanked on his arm.

他摇了摇头，却一言未发。他并不认为那条深蓝色迷你裙搭配黑色紧身裤和浅桃色衬衫是朴素的。学会在她的外貌或衣着方面向明日香坦白真相，虽痛苦却也颇有趣味。多次的购物之旅让他明白，对她而言的朴素，在他看来并非如此。在他那被她提醒缺乏品味的审美中，朴素意味着牛仔裤和 T 恤。他转过身，因为她停下脚步并拽住了他的胳膊。

Asuka watched him rub his shoulder. "So what's the party going to be like?"

明日香看着他揉肩膀，问道：“派对会是什么样的？”

"Don't know," he stated. "Probably the normal stuff that goes on at parties."

不知道，" 他说。"可能是派对上常有的那些事。

"Great," Asuka blandly replied. "Just what I need. A night of loud music, kids getting drunk, and little boys and girls making more little boys and girls."

太好了，" 明日香平淡地回答。"正是我需要的。一晚上震耳欲聋的音乐，孩子们喝得烂醉，还有小男孩和小女孩制造更多的小男孩和小女孩。

"Kouji's parties are supposedly better than that."

据说浩二的派对比那更好。

"And how do you know him?"

那你是怎么认识他的？

Shinji shrugged his shoulders, walking to the door. "Literature. He was my tutor for a short time, right after you went catatonic."

真嗣耸了耸肩，走向门口。“通过文学。你陷入昏迷后不久，他曾短暂担任过我的导师。”

"So he's a senior?" Asuka asked as she reached out for the doorbell.

"那他是长辈吗？" 明日香边问边伸手去按门铃。

"Yeah."

"Good, maybe it won't be so bad."

好，或许情况不会太糟。

Asuka's upbeat attitude lasted until the door opened to reveal a thin, mousy looking guy. She frowned at the boy as his eyes traveled over her body before he nodded at Shinji and let them in. Turning her head, she made sure that no hands or body parts approached her. After the door was closed and they entered the main part of the house, Asuka couldn't help but groan at what she saw. Her prediction of loud music and drunken teens was proven correct as they threaded their way through the mass of flesh.

明日香的乐观态度持续到门打开，露出一个瘦小、看起来有些胆怯的男孩。她皱眉看着那个男孩，他的目光在她身上游走后，向真嗣点了点头，让他们进来。她转过头，确保没有手或身体部位靠近她。门关上后，他们进入房子的主要部分，明日香忍不住呻吟起来，因为她所见到的情景证实了她对嘈杂音乐和醉酒青少年的预感。他们穿过人群，艰难前行。

"I hate being right!" shouted Asuka over the noise.

"我讨厌被证明是对的！" 明日香在噪音中大声喊道。

Shinji leaned in close to be heard. "Just give it a chance. We're here to have fun."

真嗣凑近了以便能被听见。"只是给它一个机会。我们来这里是为了找乐子。"

"Fine!" Asuka guided Shinji to the back of the house, hoping she could enjoy the night.

"好的！"明日香引导真嗣来到屋后，希望自己能享受这个夜晚。

Three hours later, she was not having fun as she quickly punched her fist through a guy’s chest and withdrew his beating heart. She sighed and watched as her competition chugged his drink before throwing down the controller in anger. The four alcoholic drinks she had been forced to drink as she learned the game were slowly working their way out of her system. Still the alcohol made her become withdrawn; only smiling each time she won a match. As her head throbbed from the music and alcohol, she pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ignore the pain behind her eyes. She blinked the spots away as the couch shifted under the weight of another victim.

三小时后，她并未感到乐趣，而是迅速一拳穿透了一个男人的胸膛，取出了他跳动的心脏。她叹了口气，看着对手在愤怒中扔下控制器前猛灌饮料。被迫边学游戏边喝下的四杯酒精饮料正逐渐从她体内代谢出去。尽管如此，酒精仍使她变得内向；每次赢得比赛时，她才露出微笑。随着音乐和酒精带来的头痛，她捏了捏鼻梁，试图忽略眼后的疼痛。当沙发因另一名受害者坐下而移动时，她眨眼驱散了眼前的斑点。

"Ready to get your ass…" She trailed off at who had sat down.

"准备好让你的屁股……"她说到一半，突然停了下来，因为有人坐了下来。

"Missed me?" inquired Shinji, grinning.

"想我了吗？" 碇真嗣笑着问道。

"Idiot," Asuka said, returning the smile. "You'll still lose. I've been at this for the last hour and a half."

傻瓜，" 明日香笑着回应道，"你还是会输的。我已经玩了一个半小时了。

"Maybe I'll lose, maybe not."

或许我会输，或许不会。

"Shut up and start the game!" she commanded.

“闭嘴，开始游戏！”她命令道。

Punches, kicks, energy blasts, and swords flew as the two EVA pilots engaged in combat. Yet neither could pull off a quick victory as the health bars shrank at a snail’s pace because the teens were too evenly matched. As the fifth and final match started, a small crowd had gathered around them, commenting on what was going on. None of that reached Asuka as the pain had returned and it was taking everything she had to ignore it and win the match. She blinked as Shinji's player got a sword slash through her defense and decapitated her player. Groaning she picked up her drink and was about to chug it when Shinji grabbed her arm.

拳脚、能量波、剑光交错飞舞，两位 EVA 驾驶员激战正酣。然而，由于双方实力旗鼓相当，生命条的缩减犹如蜗牛爬行，谁也无法速战速决。随着第五场也是最后一场对决的打响，一小群人围拢过来，议论纷纷。这些声音并未传入明日香的耳中，因为疼痛再次袭来，她正倾尽全力去忽视它，只为赢得比赛。当真嗣的玩家一剑突破她的防线，将她的角色斩首时，她不禁呻吟一声，伸手去拿饮料准备一饮而尽，却被真嗣抓住了手臂。

"You don't have to," he told her, taking the glass out of her hand.

"你不必这样，" 他说着，从她手中接过了杯子。

"Thanks," Asuka whispered a couple minutes later.

"谢谢，" 几分钟后，明日香轻声说道。

Shinji nodded. "I thought that you would have whipped me easily. Is something wrong?"

真嗣点了点头。“我以为你会轻易地打败我。有什么问题吗？”

"Just a headache. Can we go..." Asuka trailed off as a girl approached.

“只是有点头疼。我们可以走了吗……” 当一个女孩走近时，明日香的话音渐渐低了下去。

She felt Shinji flinch as her nails dug into his hand and drew blood when the girl stopped in front of them. There was no way she would ever forget or forgive the girl for what had happened on the first day back at school. Not to mention that Miyu had enjoyed taking jabs at Asuka whenever she had an opening. The only reason the girl hadn't had her ass kicked was because Shinji had pleaded that he didn't want her getting suspended.

当她的指甲刺入他的手，鲜血随之涌出，女孩在他们面前停下脚步，她感觉到真嗣的颤抖。对于开学第一天发生的事，她绝不会忘记，更不会原谅那个女孩。更别提美雪总是抓住机会对明日香冷嘲热讽。那女孩之所以还未被痛打，全因真嗣恳求不要让她因此被停学。

'Bitch.' Asuka thought as she smiled. "Hello Miyu. Funny running into you here."

'贱人。' 明日香心里想着，同时微笑着说：“你好，美雪。真巧在这里遇到你。”

"Soryu," Miyu replied before turning to Shinji.

"Soryu," 美里回答后转向真嗣。

"Hey!" Asuka protested. "I was nice enough to call you by your first name, why can't you return the favor?"

嘿！" 明日香抗议道，"我好心用你的名字称呼你，你怎么就不能同样对待我呢？

Miyu frowned. "My business isn't with you, Asuka, but with Shinji. I'd like to talk to him."

绫波皱起眉头。“我的事与你无关，明日香，我想和真嗣谈谈。”

"He's right here, so talk away." Asuka tightened her hold on him.

"他就在这儿，尽管说吧。" 明日香紧紧抓住他。

"It's private and doesn't involve you." The girl smirked and stared into Asuka's eyes. "Unless of course you don't trust Shinji."

这是私事，与你无关。"女孩冷笑一声，直视着明日香的双眼。"除非你当然不信任真嗣。

With some effort, the redhead forced her hand to open and release Shinji. There were many things she did not enjoy being reminded of and the issue of trust was one of them. She had to show everyone she trusted him to do the right thing and that she could be mature about him being with other girls. Taking deep slow breaths she let the tension drain out of her body as she turned to Shinji. His eyes were full of uncertainty and worry as he alternated looking at both girls. When he realized that Asuka was staring at him, he locked gazes with her. Slowly she nodded her head at the unspoken question and backed away a couple steps.

经过一番努力，红发女孩强迫自己张开手，放开了真嗣。有很多事情她不喜欢被提醒，信任问题就是其中之一。她必须向所有人表明，她相信真嗣会做正确的事，并且她能成熟地看待他与其他女孩在一起。她深吸慢吐，让身体的紧张感逐渐消散，然后转向真嗣。他的眼中充满了不确定和担忧，轮流看着两个女孩。当他意识到明日香正盯着他时，他与她目光相锁。慢慢地，她对那个未说出口的问题点了点头，并后退了几步。

"I'll be on the front porch. I think I saw Touji out there," she said before turning.

"我会在前廊。我想我看到冬二在外面了，"她说完就转身了。

"Okay," Shinji replied. "好的，"真嗣回答道。

He stood there and watched as Asuka walked away from him to the front door. Despite her approval, it felt like he was betraying her by going some place else with another girl. When he could no longer see auburn hair, he turned to Miyu who was staring at him with a slight frown. While she was cute, she would never approach Asuka, either physically or in personality. He pulled his hand out of her grip, she had grabbed it when Asuka left, and shook his head slightly. There was only one person he would hold hands with and she had stepped outside.

他站在那里，目送着明日香离他而去，走向前门。尽管她同意了，但感觉就像他背叛了她，要和另一个女孩去别的地方。当他再也看不到那头赤褐色的头发时，他转向了美优，她正微微皱着眉头盯着他。虽然她很可爱，但她永远无法在身体上或性格上接近明日香。他抽出了被明日香离开时美优抓住的手，轻轻地摇了摇头。他只会和一个人牵手，而那个人已经走了出去。

"So what'd you want to talk about?" he asked.

"那你想谈些什么呢？"他问道。

Miyu shook her head. "Not here. Follow me."

美雪摇了摇头。"这里不行，跟我来。"

Throwing one more glance at the front door, he turned to follow the girl through the crowd of people. As they passed the small bar the girl got a drink, handing it to Shinji with a smile. Taking care, he stepped over puddles of liquid or sleeping kids who’d had too much to drink. As they walked up the stairs, he averted his eyes from a girl who was slowly being stripped by the guy on top of her. Shinji felt his heartbeat pick up as Miyu stopped at one of the doors and motioned for him to go in first. His body went cold and his face went blank as he stepped into a bedroom and the door closed behind him with a soft click. He strode over to the wall farthest from the door before turning around.

他再次瞥了一眼前门，转身跟随女孩穿过人群。经过小酒吧时，女孩取了杯饮料，微笑着递给真嗣。他小心翼翼地跨过地上的液体和醉倒的孩子。上楼时，他避开了一个女孩被压在身上的男子慢慢剥去衣物的场景。随着美优在一扇门前停下并示意他先进，真嗣的心跳加速。当他踏入卧室，门轻轻关上时，他感到身体发冷，面无表情。他快步走到离门最远的墙边，然后转过身来。

"What's going on?" he demanded.

"怎么回事？" 他质问道。

"Oh come on, Shinji. There's no need to get angry," Miyu purred as she slinked over to the bed, and struck a sensual pose with her legs positioned just right, inviting him in. Her breasts pressed against the thin fabric of her shirt. "After all, I can offer you more than Soryu."

"哎呀，真嗣，别生气嘛。" 美雪柔声说着，婀娜地走向床边，摆出一个诱人的姿势，双腿恰到好处地摆放，仿佛在邀请他靠近。她的胸部紧贴着薄薄的衬衫面料。"毕竟，我能给你的，可比苏里要多哦。"

Shinji took a gulp from his glass before turning angry eyes to Miyu. "Like what?"

真嗣从杯中猛喝一口，然后怒视着美雪。"比如什么？"

"I can make you happy for the rest of your life. Think of it, no more being yelled at or hit. I won't demean you. Your life would be perfect." As she was talking, she began unbuttoning her shirt. "Best of all, you can have me as many times as you want.”

"我能让你余生都幸福快乐。想想看，再也不会有人对你大吼大叫或动手打你。我不会贬低你。你的生活将会完美无缺。" 她边说边开始解开衬衫的扣子。"最重要的是，你可以随心所欲地拥有我。”

Shinji watched indifferently as Miyu ran a hand down her chest, pushing the cloth out of the way and baring her breasts to him. Even as she played with her mounds, moaning every once in while, he felt absolutely no attraction to the girl. Sure he had felt some stirring in his loins for a minute or two but as she continued to strip and play with her body, it disappeared. He finished off his drink, thinking she was just a girl who thought sex would get her whatever she wanted. His body tensed as she got off the bed and made her way over to him.

真嗣冷漠地看着美雪用手抚过自己的胸口，推开衣物，向他展露双乳。尽管她不时地玩弄着自己的乳房，发出呻吟，但他对这女孩毫无兴趣。确实，有那么一两分钟他感到下体有些躁动，但随着她继续脱衣并抚弄自己的身体，这种感觉消失了。他喝完了饮料，心想她不过是个以为用性就能得到一切的女孩。当她从床上下来，向他走来时，他的身体紧绷起来。

"Oh come on, Shinji. I know you want it," she cooed in his ear as she rubbed her body against his, reaching down to rub his crotch.

"哦，来吧，真嗣。我知道你想要的，"她在他耳边低语，同时用身体摩擦着他，伸手去抚摸他的胯部。

"Get away from me," He hissed, ignoring the feeling of her breasts.

"离我远点，"他嘶声说道，无视她胸部的触感。

"Why?" She screamed as he pushed past her. "What does a relationship with Asuka give you?"

为什么？" 她尖叫着，而他从她身边推过。"和明日香的关系能给你什么？

"You wouldn't understand." Shinji shook his head as he suddenly developed a strong headache.

"你不会明白的。" 真嗣摇了摇头，突然感到一阵剧烈的头痛。

Miyu wasn't to be deterred and she grabbed him and dragged him over to the bed. "Try me. Anything she can offer, I can do better."

美雪并未打算退缩，她抓住他，将他拖到床边。“试试我。她能提供的，我都能做得更好。”

"It isn't what she can offer me that is important but what she does for me." He jerked his arm out of her grasp. "Our relationship isn’t about what we get out of it but what we do for each other. I know that Asuka will always push me to do better, to become someone. I get her to open up to her gentler side, something that no one else can do." He turned and glared. "You can't offer me that because you don't have her drive."

“重要的不是她能给我什么，而是她为我做了什么。”他猛地抽出手臂，挣脱她的抓握。“我们的关系不在于我们从中得到什么，而在于我们为彼此做了什么。我知道飞鸟总是激励我做得更好，成为某个人。我让她展现出温柔的一面，这是别人做不到的。”他转过身，怒目而视。“你给不了我这些，因为你没有她的那种动力。”

"I can change," she whispered, trying to push him down, guiding his hand to between her legs.

"我可以改变，"她低声说道，试图将他推倒，引导他的手伸向她的双腿之间。

Shinji staggered to his feet and over to the door. "You can't because all you're doing is using me." He slowed, trying to keep talking as it became harder. "Asuka and my happiness are a combined effort in that when one of us is happy the other is also." He leaned back against the door as his legs trembled. "What did you do to me?"

真嗣摇摇晃晃地站起来，走向门口。"你做不到，因为你只是在利用我。"他放慢了语速，努力继续说着，因为越来越困难。"明日香和我的幸福是共同努力的结果，当我们中的一个人快乐时，另一个人也会快乐。"他背靠着门，双腿颤抖。"你对我做了什么？"

"Nothing," Miyu told him as she kissed his neck.

"没什么，" 美雪一边说着，一边吻了他的脖子。

“Don’t lie to me!” Shinji ignored the feelings of her moist lips and continued talking, trying to stay conscious. "And no matter how much you try, you'll never understand me because you never experienced what we've gone through. I know Asuka because she is me, and I am her. We're meant to be soul mates."

“别骗我了！” 真嗣忽略了她的湿润唇瓣带来的感觉，继续说着，努力保持清醒。"无论你如何尝试，你永远无法理解我，因为你从未经历过我们所经历的一切。我了解明日香，因为她就是我，我就是她。我们注定是灵魂伴侣。"

"Has your soul mate…" Miyu hissed those words. "Ever kissed..."

你的灵魂伴侣……" 美雪低声说出这些话。"曾经吻过……

Shinji watched as Miyu's eyes widened as she fell to the ground with a loud thump from his shove. He shook his head as his vision continued to get blurry and wrenched open the door, making his way down the stairs. A couple times he almost fell to the floor as his sense of balance was going fast. He ignored the muted shouts as he pushed past schoolmates and went through the front door. The clean air almost made him to faint as he searched out Asuka in the small crowd. His stomach twisted and he felt bile rise as he spotted her near the edge of the property, talking to Touji. A hand pointed in his direction and Asuka turned around. He saw her eyes go wide as he made it to them, sweating.

真嗣看着美雪的眼睛因他的推搡而瞪大，重重地摔倒在地。他摇摇头，视线越发模糊，猛地打开门，跌跌撞撞地下楼。好几次他差点摔倒，平衡感迅速丧失。他无视同学们的低声呼喊，穿过前门。清新的空气几乎让他晕厥，他在人群中寻找明日香。胃里一阵翻腾，他感到恶心，当看到她站在校园边缘与徳治交谈时。一只手指向他，明日香转过身来。他看到她的眼睛因他的到来而瞪大，满头大汗。

"What's the matter with you?" She asked, worried as she pressed a hand to his forehead.

"你怎么了？"她担心地问道，同时用手按了按他的额头。

Shinji shook his head. "Nothing."

真嗣摇了摇头。"没事。"

"Don't give us that bullshit, Shinji. You look like crap," Touji commented as he looked at his friend’s dilated pupils. "I think we should get you to a hospital."

别跟我们扯那些废话，真嗣。你看起来糟透了，" 东治看着朋友放大的瞳孔评论道。"我觉得我们应该送你去医院。

"No," slurred Shinji. "Let's just go home."

不，" 真嗣含糊地说。"我们还是回家吧。

"Fine," Asuka replied sharply. "You can be such an idiot." Yet despite her words, she took one of his arms and draped it over her shoulders before putting her arm around his waist. She brought her lips close to his ear. "I want to know everything."

好吧，" 明日香尖锐地回答，"你有时候真是个白痴。" 尽管如此，她还是拉过他的一只胳膊搭在自己肩上，然后用手臂环住他的腰。她将嘴唇贴近他的耳朵，"我想知道一切。

"I promise."

Even with the help from Asuka, Shinji found his strength fading as they walked away from the party and into the darkness. Once he stumbled and almost dragged her to the pavement before they recovered. His eyesight was gone, with everything and everyone a blur. Sometime later he heard Asuka tell Touji to go do something but he didn't know how long he had been walking or how long Touji had been gone. As his body shut down, Shinji finally fell to the pavement and didn't get up, succumbing to the darkness.

尽管有明日香的协助，真嗣在离开派对步入黑暗时，仍感到体力逐渐不支。一次他踉跄了一下，差点把明日香拖到地上，好在他们及时稳住了脚步。他的视力消失了，周围的一切人和物都变得模糊不清。不知过了多久，他听到明日香让东治去做某事，但他不知道自己走了多久，也不知道东治离开了多久。随着身体的崩溃，真嗣最终倒在了地上，再也没有起来，陷入了黑暗之中。

- - - -

“Is he going to be okay?” Shinji recognized Touji’s voice as he awoke. “We should have just gone back inside at Kouji’s.”

“他不会有事吧？”真嗣醒来时，认出了东治的声音。“我们本应该在浩二的家里就回去的。”

“Be quiet!” Asuka told him. “There was no way I was going back into the same house as Miyu.” She paused. “Thanks for your help, but I can handle it from here.”

“安静点！”明日香对他说。“我绝不会再回到有美雪的同一个房子里。”她停顿了一下。“谢谢你的帮助，但我可以自己处理了。”

“But…”

“I can handle it,” she growled.

“我能应付，”她咆哮道。

“Fine! But you have him call me no matter what, Asuka.” Touji walked away grumbling under his breath. “Never thought I’d see her cry.”

“好吧！但无论如何要让他给我打电话，飞鸟。”东治嘟囔着走开了。“从没想过会看到她哭。”

A hand on his forehead caused Shinji to moan in pain as his body throbbed. The last thing he remembered was the pain of impacting with the sidewalk and him passing into darkness. Another hand joined the first, but this time, on his cheek as something was pressed against his lips. He coughed, as he was not ready for the flow of water into his mouth. Again the person calmed him with just a touch and he took small sips, letting his parched throat soak up the water. Too soon though, the bottle was removed and he worked his tongue around, trying to get saliva going.

额头上的手让真嗣痛苦呻吟，身体阵阵剧痛。他最后的记忆是撞击人行道的痛楚和随之而来的黑暗。另一只手也加入，这次轻抚他的脸颊，有东西触碰他的唇。他未及防备，水流入口中，不禁咳嗽起来。那人仅凭触碰安抚他，他便小口啜饮，让干涸的喉咙浸润水分。然而水瓶很快被移开，他努力活动舌头，试图分泌唾液。

"Are you going to open your eyes anytime soon?" Asuka's voice was soothing to his ears. A touch of worry mixed with care and a hint of sarcasm.

"你打算什么时候睁开眼睛？"明日香的声音对他来说很抚慰。带着一丝担忧，夹杂着关心，还有一点讽刺。

Slowly Shinji allowed his eyes to open in small increments, allowing them to adjust. But it was unnecessary as it was still dark out and he stared up at the stars. The night sky was blotted out as Asuka leaned over and looked in his eyes. He frowned at the tear tracks covering her cheeks. As they gazed upon each other Shinji found himself studying her pink lips. He had never noticed how they looked like a rosebud, though they were pressed together rather tightly at the moment.

慢慢地，真嗣让眼睛一点点睁开，让它们适应。但这是多余的，因为外面还是黑的，他仰望着星星。夜空被明日香俯身遮住了，她凝视着他的眼睛。他皱眉看着她脸颊上的泪痕。当他们凝视彼此时，真嗣发现自己正在研究她的粉红色嘴唇。他从未注意到它们看起来像一朵玫瑰花蕾，尽管此刻它们紧紧地压在一起。

"And what on my face is more important than reassuring me about your health?" Asuka asked, her face worried and angry. "If you die on me I'll never forgive you."

还有，我脸上的什么比让我安心你的健康更重要？" 明日香问道，她的脸既担忧又愤怒。"如果你死在我面前，我永远不会原谅你。

"I'm not going to die." He tried to sit up but Asuka kept him down with a firm touch. "And I was looking at your lips."

我不会死的。" 他试图坐起来，但明日香用坚定的触碰让他躺下。"我刚才在看你的嘴唇。

Asuka cocked her head slightly. "What about them?"

明日香微微侧头，"他们怎么了？"

"They look like a rosebud. A pink rosebud in fact."

它们看起来像一朵花蕾，实际上是一朵粉红色的玫瑰花蕾。

"Is that so?" She growled, though the compliment was one that she never expected. "And do they look kissable?"

真是这样吗？"她低吼道，尽管这赞美是她始料未及的。"那它们看起来好亲吗？

"Very much so," he whispered, feeling his throat go dry.

"确实如此，"他低声说道，感到喉咙发干。

The corners of her mouth turned up into a faint smile at his admission. Sure he had called her beautiful but this was the first time he had specifically named a part of her body. She felt weird since she always thought he would notice other parts first, like her butt or breasts. Wiping at her tears, she stared at the young man who was lying with his head in her lap. This was the first time she had been able to return the favor. Still she wished it were under better circumstances, instead of him falling unconscious and being carried to a park bench.

听到他的坦白，她嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝浅笑。虽然他曾夸她美丽，但这是他第一次具体提到她身体的某个部位。她感到有些奇怪，因为她一直以为他会先注意到其他部位，比如她的臀部或胸部。她擦去眼泪，凝视着那个头枕在她腿上的年轻人。这是她第一次有机会回报他。尽管如此，她还是希望这不是因为他昏迷不醒，被抬到公园长椅上的情况下。

Shinji swallowed as he saw Asuka smile right before she leaned down. His attention was focused on her face as it slowly came closer to his. He licked his own lips, noticing her mouth was open slightly. The touch of her hair on his neck and face caused him to shiver at its feathery touch. Because of her hold on him, he was unable to reach up to touch her. When her breath washed over his lips, he closed his eyes in anticipation. But nothing happened; instead he heard her breathing next to his ear.

碇真嗣吞了吞口水，就在这时，他看到明日香微笑着俯下身来。他的注意力完全集中在她渐渐靠近的脸庞上。他舔了舔自己的嘴唇，注意到她的嘴微微张开。她的头发轻触他的脖子和脸颊，那如羽毛般的触感让他不禁打了个寒颤。由于她的紧握，他无法伸手去触摸她。当她的气息拂过他的唇边时，他闭上眼睛，满怀期待。然而，什么也没发生，取而代之的是他在耳边听到了她的呼吸声。

"You owe me a story," she purred.

"你欠我一个故事，"她柔声说道。

Opening his eyes, he found hers inches from his own. Even in the faint light of street lamp they were a beautiful light shade of blue. Still he made sure that no sign of disappointment appeared on his face or in his voice. But the corners of Asuka's eyes curled slightly as she smiled again. Letting his head fall back onto her lap, Shinji spent a few minutes composing his thoughts in his head and wondering how the girl would react.

他睁开眼睛，发现她的眼睛离自己的只有几英寸远。即使在街灯微弱的光线下，她的眼睛仍然是那种美丽的浅蓝色。尽管如此，他确保脸上和声音中没有流露出失望的迹象。但当明日香再次微笑时，她的眼角微微上扬。他让头靠回她的膝上，真嗣在脑海中整理思绪，并好奇这个女孩会如何反应。

"As you know, Miyu wanted to talk to me." He saw her nod. "Well, after getting me a new drink she led me upstairs..."

如你所知，Miyu 想和我谈谈。"他看到她点头。"嗯，在我拿到新饮料后，她带我上了楼……

Asuka sat there quietly as Shinji told his tale of what happened in the house after she left. She felt her body tense and the blood drain from her face as he spoke of Miyu stripping in front of him. But those feelings were soon replaced by an anger so strong she wanted to throw up. To believe someone would resort to such low tactics and demean herself just to get a boyfriend was sick. She tried to control her trembling as she knew that Miyu would have never stuck with Shinji, moving on when she got tired of him.

Asuka 静静地坐在那里，听着 Shinji 讲述她离开后房子里发生的事情。当 Shinji 提到 Miyu 在他面前脱衣服时，她感到身体紧绷，脸色苍白。但这些感觉很快被一股强烈的愤怒所取代，她甚至想吐。相信有人会采取如此卑劣的手段，仅仅为了得到一个男朋友而贬低自己，这太恶心了。她试图控制自己颤抖的身体，因为她知道 Miyu 永远不会和 Shinji 长久，一旦厌倦就会离开他。

"And then she tried to kiss me," whispered Shinji, his tale complete.

"然后她试图吻我，" 碇真嗣低声说道，他的故事讲完了。

"That fucking bitch," growled Asuka, her voice rising. "I'm going to kill her! I'm going to...I'm going to. Damn it! That whore will..." A hand on her cheek stopped her.

"那个该死的贱人，"明日香咆哮着，声音越来越高。"我要杀了她！我要...我要。该死！那个婊子会..."一只手放在她的脸颊上阻止了她。

"Just forget it, please," he begged. “You trusted me to do the right thing and I did, so let it go.”

"就请忘了吧，" 他恳求道。“你信任我去做正确的事，我也做到了，所以就让它过去吧。”

"No, I will not forget it! Shinji, she was going to have sex without your consent." She felt pain in her mouth as she clenched her jaw. "That's rape."

不，我不会忘记的！真嗣，她打算未经你同意就发生性关系。" 她紧咬牙关，感到嘴里的疼痛。"那是强奸。

"She wasn't..." He couldn't finish the sentence.

"她并不是……" 他没能把话说完。

"It wasn't fate that you suddenly started feeling the way you did. She slipped a drug into your drink." Asuka watched as the anger in Shinji's eyes grew, and she reached a decision. "Did you mean what you said?"

你突然有那种感觉，并非命运使然。是她在你饮料里下了药。" 明日香看着真嗣眼中的怒火渐盛，她做出了决定。"你刚才说的话是真心的吗？

"What?"

"About our relationship? How I wouldn't let you be average?" she asked, quietly.

"关于我们的关系？我怎么会让你平庸呢？"她轻声问道。

"Yes, I meant everything." He smiled weakly. "When you're happy, I'm happy. You force me to improve, to strive without even knowing it. Everything I've done is because I saw you do it."

是的，我说的都是真心话。"他虚弱地笑了笑。"你快乐，我就快乐。你无形中促使我进步的，让我不断努力。我所做的一切，都是因为我看到你这样做了。

"Then how come you never told me." Asuka's voice sounded strangled. "I've wanted to know why we're together."

那你怎么从没告诉过我。" 明日香的声音听起来有些哽咽。"我一直想知道我们为什么在一起。

Shinji calmly told her, his anger gone. "Because I was scared. I thought if I told you that, you wouldn't want to be around me anymore. I was frightened that all you would see was a weak little boy."

真嗣平静地告诉她，怒气已消。"因为我害怕。我以为如果我告诉你，你就不会再想和我在一起了。我害怕你只会看到一个软弱的小男孩。"

"Idiot. You just gave the reason why I wouldn't push you away." She allowed him to sit up on the bench beside her. "It took me a long time to realize it and it scared me but you're right. We are the same, and only we can be there for each other. No one else can do that because they never experienced what we've gone through."

傻瓜。你刚才说的正是我不会推开你的原因。"她让他坐到她旁边的长凳上。"我花了很长时间才明白这一点，这让我害怕，但你是对的。我们是一样的，只有我们能互相支持。其他人做不到，因为他们从未经历过我们所经历的。

"Thank you," he said after some silence.

"谢谢你，"他沉默了一会儿后说道。

"Did she kiss you?" She smiled mischievously at the shake of his head. "Good."

她吻你了吗？"她看着他摇头的样子，狡黠地笑了。"很好。

Shinji wasn't able to say anything as Asuka wrapped her arms around his neck just before she made contact. He stared into her eyes in shock but as she continued to kiss him, the shock was replaced by desire. Letting his body relax he kissed her back, losing himself in the moment. She continued to suckle him, moaning as he ran his fingers through her hair. When he pulled her closer all she did was smile, and parted her lips slightly, she slid her tongue into his mouth, seeing the surprise in his eyes before he copied her. As their tongues dueled and they remained locked Asuka felt scared at the sudden connection she felt in her soul to Shinji. But she pushed the fear down letting only happiness fill her. As his tongue retreated, she gently pulled away and smiled before resting her head on his chest.

真嗣还未来得及开口，就在即将触碰之际，明日香已将双臂环抱住他的脖颈。他震惊地凝视着她的双眼，但随着她继续亲吻，震惊被欲望所取代。他放松身体，回应她的吻，沉醉于此刻。她继续吮吸着他，当他手指穿过她的发丝时，她发出呻吟。当他将她拉近，她只是微笑，微微张开双唇，将舌头滑入他的口中，捕捉到他眼中的惊讶，随即模仿她的动作。当他们的舌头交缠，紧紧相拥时，明日香感到一种突如其来的灵魂深处的连接，这让她心生恐惧。但她压抑住恐惧，只让幸福充盈心间。随着他的舌头退去，她轻柔地抽离，微笑着将头靠在他的胸膛上。

"I'm the only one you're allowed to kiss."

我是你唯一被允许亲吻的人。

Late December 2018

"What are you doing up so late?"

这么晚了你在忙什么呢？

Shinji lazily turned from his study of the stars to see Asuka poking her head through the balcony door before the rest of her body followed. Grinning, she strode over to where he sat, and leaned down to give him a kiss before sitting in his lap. His arms went around her waist and they sat there in silence. Neither of them had been really talkative lately, as this time of the year was depressing for both of them. Asuka shifted around until she was looking into his face, frowning at what she saw.

真嗣懒洋洋地从观星中转过头，只见明日香探头探脑地从阳台门钻了进来，随后整个身子也跟了进来。她咧嘴一笑，大步走到他坐的地方，俯身给了他一个吻，然后坐在他的腿上。他的手臂环抱住她的腰，两人就这样静静地坐着。最近他们都不太爱说话，因为这个时节对他们俩来说都颇为压抑。明日香扭动着身体，直到她能直视他的脸，看到他的表情后，她皱起了眉头。

"So what are you doing up?" she repeated.

“那你到底在忙什么呢？”她又问了一遍。

"I…I couldn't sleep.”

Asuka nodded. "That explains why you weren't in your bed, but not what's keeping you awake."

明日香点头道：“这就解释了为什么你不在床上，但没说明是什么让你睡不着。”

"This is a bad time of the year for me, and nightmares..." He trailed off as he saw the dark circles under the girl's eyes. "Sorry. This isn't a good time for you either."

这个季节对我来说很糟糕，还有噩梦……" 他话没说完，就看到了女孩眼下的黑眼圈。"抱歉。对你来说也不是个好时候。

"Yeah, too many memories," she admitted. "Mama's death, the 15th Angel, and my attempted suicide." Her face was full of pain. "Everything I want to forget, I can't, and it's all lumped together."

是啊，太多回忆了，" 她承认道，"妈妈的去世，第 15 使徒，还有我那次自杀未遂。" 她的脸上写满了痛苦。"所有我想忘记的，却忘不掉，全都纠缠在一起。

"Same here. I couldn't help you, then I lost you. Rei died but was brought back, only for me to learn the sick truth about her." Shinji's eyes darkened. "Then Kaoru…"

我也一样。那时我没能帮到你，然后失去了你。绫波死了却又被复活，而我得知了关于她的残酷真相。" 真嗣的眼神变得阴沉。"然后是薰……

Asuka felt Shinji's body tremble as he said the name, whether it was in anger or fear she couldn't tell. Instead she pulled him to his feet and hugged him close, waiting as he brought his emotions under control. Even when he hugged back, it seemed forced. Swallowing, she lifted his head up, studying his eyes. Like he had done with her many times in the past, she knew that she would have to get him to talk about what hurt.

明日香感觉到真嗣在说出那个名字时身体颤抖，不知是因为愤怒还是恐惧，她无法分辨。于是她拉他站起来，紧紧抱住他，等待他控制住自己的情绪。即使他回抱，也显得很勉强。她咽了咽口水，抬起他的头，凝视他的眼睛。就像他过去多次对她做的那样，她知道必须让他谈论那些伤痛。

"Who was Kaoru?” she asked in a light tone. She tightened her hold on him. "Please."

薰是谁？”她用轻松的语气问道，同时收紧了拥抱。"拜托了。

Shinji closed his eyes, and crossed his arms over her back. He could feel strands of her hair brush against his cheek and neck while the scent of her shampoo drifted off her. Yet the comfort she had given him so many times before didn't come. They had told each other so much in the last year it was like there had never been a barrier between them. Still he knew that she had kept some things from him and he had kept some from her. But as Asuka continued to hold him, reassuring him in body and spirit, he found he wanted to tell her.

真嗣闭上眼睛，双臂交叉在她的背上。他能感觉到她的发丝轻拂过他的脸颊和脖子，而她洗发水的香味从她身上飘散开来。然而，她以往多次给予他的安慰这次却没有降临。在过去的一年里，他们彼此倾诉了太多，仿佛之间从未有过隔阂。尽管如此，他知道她对他有所保留，他也对她有所隐瞒。但随着明日香继续抱着他，以身体和精神安慰他，他发现自己想要告诉她。

"H-he was the…the 17th Angel." Shinji felt Asuka tense. "And my friend."

他...他是第...第 17 使徒。" 真嗣感觉到明日香的身体一紧。"也是我的朋友。

"How…" She couldn't finish, only shaking her head.

"怎么…" 她说不下去了，只是摇了摇头。

"No one knew…no that's not true, SEELE knew when they sent him, and maybe the Commander. I didn't know what he was. He was your replacement." He choked on the final word, knowing Asuka could never be replaced. "I was so far gone that I wouldn't have noticed or even cared but...he sought me out. He befriended me, and got me to open up. Kaoru was the first person to tell me..."

没有人知道……不，那不是真的，SEELE 知道他们派他来的时间，也许指挥官也知道。我不知道他是什么。他是你的替代品。" 他在最后那个词上哽咽了，知道明日香是无可替代的。"我当时已经迷失得太深，以至于我既不会注意到，也不会在乎，但是……他找到了我。他与我交朋友，让我敞开心扉。薰是第一个告诉我……

Asuka pulled back to look at Shinji after he went silent. She smiled, hoping to see him brighten up but this was not to be the case. Letting the smile drop, she stroked his cheek and cupped his chin in her palm. That got him to smile faintly, as he reached up to grip her hand in his.

明日香后退一步，注视着沉默下来的真嗣。她微笑着，希望看到他振作起来，但这并未如愿。笑容消失后，她轻抚他的脸颊，用手掌托起他的下巴。这让他露出了淡淡的微笑，他伸手握住了她的手。

"What did he tell you?" she asked.

"他跟你说了什么？" 她问道。

Shinji broke from her and went to the railing. Looking down at the street, he frowned. "He told me he...loved me, and he cared about me." Asuka stood there wide-eyed, barely hearing his whisper. She flinched as he punched the wall. "Then he betrayed me! He took all those feelings, and threw them away!"

真嗣挣脱她，走向栏杆。俯视街道，他皱起眉头。“他告诉我他……爱我，关心我。”明日香站在那里，睁大眼睛，几乎听不见他的低语。他一拳打在墙上，她不禁一缩。“然后他背叛了我！他把所有那些感情都抛弃了！”

"Shinji…" Asuka touched his shoulder, causing him to spin around.

"真嗣……" 明日香触碰了他的肩膀，使他转过身来。

"He made me choose between my life or his! He made me kill him, crushing his body in my EVA's hand." He bowed his head. "He forced me to choose humanity's fate!" He locked his knees to keep from falling. "Who am I to make a decision like that!"

他让我在我和他的生命之间做出选择！他迫使我杀了他，用我的 EVA 手捏碎他的身体。"他低下头。"他强迫我决定人类的命运！"他锁紧膝盖以防跌倒。"我有什么资格做出那样的决定！

"You are the only person I would trust to make that decision, Shinji," whispered Asuka as she took him in her arms again. "For all your faults and weaknesses, you always make the right choices…"

真嗣，你是唯一一个我会信任来做这个决定的人，"明日香低声说着，再次将他拥入怀中。"尽管你有种种缺点和弱点，你总是能做出正确的选择……

"No, I don't," he interrupted.

"Be quiet please." She lifted his chin to look in his eyes. "You chose life over a false friendship. If you had chosen death we wouldn't be standing here. I wouldn't be here." She felt him tremble. "If we had died, we would have never learned how much we cared for each other. We would have never been able to correct our mistakes. Even though you might wish you were dead, I'm glad you're alive because death is final. As long as you're alive you have a chance to attain happiness." She stopped at his expression. "What?"

请安静。" 她抬起他的下巴，直视他的眼睛。"你选择了生命而非虚假的友谊。如果你选择了死亡，我们就不会站在这里。我也不会在这里。" 她感觉到他在颤抖。"如果我们死了，我们就永远不会知道我们有多在乎彼此。我们永远没有机会纠正我们的错误。尽管你可能希望自己已经死了，但我很高兴你还活着，因为死亡是终结。只要你还活着，你就有机会获得幸福。" 她停下来看着他的表情。"怎么了？

"My mother said that once," Shinji murmured. “About the happiness.

"我母亲曾这么说过，" 真嗣低声说。“关于幸福。”

"She was a very smart person, like me," joked Asuka, grinning. "I did end up with you. And I will never betray your love."

她是个非常聪明的人，就像我一样，" 明日香笑着打趣道，"我最终还是和你在一起了。我永远不会背叛你的爱。

Asuka watched Shinji nod before he stepped closer, his breath on her lips. She blinked in surprise as he took the initiative and kissed her. Closing her eyes, she pressed harder against his lips, losing herself in the heat of the moment. Since finding out how enjoyable kissing was they had been doing it more often. The girl jumped a little when the wall touched her, not realizing they had moved. She moaned as his hands stroked up and down her back, shivering at each touch, before coming to rest on her butt. Her hands went from his shoulders to his torso then began pulling his shirt up, before sliding across his muscled chest. She kept kissing him while moving one of her hands lower.

明日香看着真嗣点头后，他走近了，气息拂过她的唇。她惊讶地眨了眨眼，因为他主动吻了她。闭上眼睛，她更加用力地贴紧他的唇，沉醉在那一刻的激情中。自从发现接吻的乐趣后，他们就更加频繁地这样做。当墙壁触碰到她时，女孩微微一跳，没有意识到他们已经移动了位置。她呻吟着，因为他的手在她背上上下抚摸，每一次触碰都让她颤抖，最后停在了她的臀部。她的手从他的肩膀滑到他的胸膛，然后开始拉起他的衬衫，滑过他结实的胸肌。她一边继续吻他，一边将一只手向下移动。

Shinji had never thought he would ever feel this way in his life as they stood there locked together. He jumped a little when she slipped her hands under his shirt, but her soft touch erased any fears. Even as her hand traced down his stomach to his shorts, his own hands were busy. He rubbed her smooth toned legs before slipping his hands under the hem of her T-shirt, coming into contact with firm, hot flesh. Smiling, he stroked the curves of her buttocks, enjoying the feeling as he kneaded them. His thumbs slid under the elastic band of her panties, pulling them down as he opened his eyes.

真嗣从未想过自己会在生活中有如此感受，当他们站在那里紧紧相拥时。她将手滑进他的衬衫下时，他微微一惊，但她温柔的触碰消除了所有恐惧。即使她的手顺着他的腹部滑向短裤，他的双手也忙个不停。他抚摸着她光滑结实的大腿，然后把手伸进她的 T 恤下摆，触碰到坚实而火热的肌肤。他微笑着，抚摸着她臀部的曲线，享受着揉捏它们的触感。他的拇指滑到她内裤的松紧带下，边往下拉边睁开眼睛。

The teens jumped apart in shock after they made eye contact. Each stood there with faces flushed from arousal and embarrassment. Asuka pulled her panties up, while he tucked in his shirt. The two teens kept finding something else to look at besides the other. Finally light blue met dark blue after a few minutes of silence; each reassured and scared by the combination of love and desire they saw in the other. Both felt embarrassed at how they had let things speed up and get out of control. The only redeeming factor being that nothing serious happened between the two of them.

少年少女因眼神接触而惊慌分开，各自站在那里，面颊因情欲和羞涩而泛红。明日香拉起内裤，而他则整理衬衫。两人不断寻找其他东西来转移视线，避免看向对方。几分钟后，浅蓝与深蓝的目光终于相遇；彼此在对方眼中看到了爱与欲望的交织，既感到安心又心生恐惧。两人都为事情失控加速而感到尴尬，唯一值得庆幸的是，他们之间并未发生什么严重的事情。

"Asuka, I'm…" Shinji shut his mouth upon seeing her harsh glare.

"明日香，我…" 看到她严厉的目光，真嗣闭上了嘴。

"Don't say a word," she commanded. "We both let our hormones rage. So don't go saying it's all your fault." She smirked as he turned redder. "You don't know how hard it is for me at times.”

"别说话，" 她命令道。"我们都让荷尔蒙冲昏了头。所以别说是你一个人的错。" 她看着他脸红得更厉害，得意地笑了。"你不知道我有时候有多难。”

He smiled faintly. "I know. It’s just as hard for me to ignore those feelings. You’re beautiful, very beautiful." He saw her nod. Swallowing, he averted his eyes. "But I don't think you know what that does to me. You're perfect in my eyes." He waited for a question or an outburst, but when neither came he continued. "I know you're not teasing me, but everything you do or wear, gets my attention. Everyday clothes, like your school uniform or the clothes you lounge around in are bad enough, but when you dress up, like on our date for example, I can't help but look at you."

他微微一笑，说：“我知道。要忽视那些感觉对我来说同样困难。你很美，非常美。”他看到她点了点头。他咽了咽口水，移开了视线。“但我想你不知道那对我意味着什么。在我眼里，你是完美的。”他等待着问题或爆发，但什么也没有，于是他继续说：“我知道你不是在逗我，但你所做的一切，所穿的衣服，都吸引着我的注意。日常的衣服，比如你的校服或你在家穿的休闲装已经够糟糕了，但当你打扮起来，比如我们约会那天，我忍不住要看着你。”

"Good, I'm glad I have that effect." She walked over to him and stood there. Her face flashed with anger briefly before she sat down on his lap, the earlier incident gone, but not forgotten.

“好，我很高兴我有这样的影响力。”她走过去站在他面前。她的脸上闪过一丝愤怒，然后坐在他的腿上，之前的插曲已经过去，但并未被遗忘。

"No, it's not all right!" Despite his outburst he held the girl. "You don't know the things that go through my mind at times. I've always seen you as a person, never an object. But when I look at you all I can see is…"

不，这根本不对！"尽管他情绪激动，但还是紧紧抱着女孩。"你不知道我有时脑海里会闪过什么念头。我一直把你当作一个人，从未当作物品。但当我看着你时，我只能看到……

"It's natural to feel like that, Shinji," she told him.

"感到那样是很自然的，真嗣。" 她对他说道。

"I know, and that's what makes it so frustrating," he growled. "I want to think that maybe one day we'll do it, but I don't want our relationship to suffer because of that. I don't want to force you to do anything."

"我明白，这正是令人沮丧的地方，"他低吼道，"我希望相信或许有一天我们能做到，但我不想因此让我们的关系受损。我不想强迫你做任何事。"

Asuka sat there on his lap, digesting what she had just heard Shinji say. Sure it had surprised her to hear him actually tell her that he wanted to have sex with her, but at the same time it wasn't surprising. After all, she had told Misato she wanted to experience it at some point. All his admission did was reinforce what she already knew. Leaning down, she rested her forehead against his and stared into his eyes.

明日香坐在他的腿上，消化着刚刚听到的真嗣的话。当然，听到他真的告诉她他想和她发生关系，这让她感到惊讶，但同时也不意外。毕竟，她曾告诉过美里，她想在某一刻体验这件事。他的坦白只是强化了她已经知道的事情。她俯下身，将额头贴在他的额头上，凝视着他的眼睛。

"Shinji, when we make love for the first time..." She felt him tremble. "Yes, I want to do it with you, just as much as you do," Asuka admitted. "Anyways, when we have sex for the first time I don't want any regrets between us. I don't want to wake up the next day scared that I did something I wasn't prepared to do. I only want to feel love on that night."

真嗣，当我们第一次做爱时……" 她感觉到他在颤抖。"是的，我想和你做，就像你想和我做一样，" 明日香承认道。"无论如何，当我们第一次发生关系时，我不希望我们之间有任何遗憾。我不想第二天醒来时害怕我做了一些我没有准备好的事情。我只希望那一夜能感受到爱。

"That’s all I want to feel too,” he said, looking into her eyes. “I love you, Asuka."

"那也是我想要感受的，”他说着，凝视着她的眼睛。“我爱你，明日香。”

She gave him a brief kiss. "I know, and that's why I know you'll understand when I ask you to be patient. We'll know when the time is right."

她给了他一个简短的吻，说：“我知道，正因为如此，我相信你会理解我请你耐心等待的原因。我们会知道何时时机成熟。”

March 10, 2019

“I’m home,” Shinji said as he walked into the apartment.

“我回来了，” 真嗣说着走进了公寓。

The boy saw a mess of auburn hair hanging over the edge of the couch but Asuka didn’t move. Yet as he went into the kitchen he could feel her eyes on his back, boring into him. Sighing, he placed the groceries on the counter and got out the utensils he would need. While the water heated in the double boiler, he looked for the molds but couldn’t find them. Going through the cabinets Shinji grew confused, knowing they had chocolate molds. Shaking his head, he turned off the stove, preparing to go back to the store. The boy jumped when he turned to the kitchen entrance.

男孩看到一团赤褐色的头发凌乱地垂在沙发边缘，但明日香没有动。然而，当他走进厨房时，他能感觉到她的目光盯在他的背上，仿佛要穿透他。他叹了口气，把买来的东西放在柜台上，拿出需要的厨具。当双层蒸锅里的水加热时，他寻找模具，但找不到。在橱柜中翻找的碇真嗣感到困惑，他知道他们有巧克力模具。他摇了摇头，关掉炉子，准备回商店去。当他转身面向厨房入口时，男孩吓了一跳。

“Looking for these?” growled Asuka, her eyes flashing. In her hand were the molds. “Did you expect me to sit by quietly while you made chocolates for other girls? To be insulted without giving a word of protest.”

“在找这个吗？”明日香低吼道，眼中闪着光。她手里拿着模具。“你以为我会静静地坐着，看着你为其他女孩做巧克力吗？被侮辱了连一句抗议都不说。”

“I don’t know why you’re making a big deal…”

“我不知道你为什么这么大惊小怪……”

“A big deal!” she screamed, stalking forward. “It is a big deal to me! You think I don’t see the way others look at you or the whispers I have to put up with in the locker room?”

“大惊小怪！”她尖叫着，大步向前。“对我来说这就是大问题！你以为我没看到别人看你的眼神，或是我在更衣室里不得不忍受的窃窃私语吗？”

The boy stood his ground as she stopped in front of him. “It’s just tradition to return the favor from Valentine’s Day, Asuka.”

男孩坚定地站在原地，当她停在他面前时说：“这只是为了回敬情人节的传统，明日香。”

“It’s a stupid tradition.” She jabbed him in the chest. “Where I come from when two people are dating others know they’re off limits.”

“这是个愚蠢的传统。”她戳了戳他的胸口，“在我家乡，当两个人在交往时，其他人都知道他们是禁区。”

“Asuka, they know that. They’re saying they’re just friends.”

“明日香，他们知道这一点。他们说他们只是朋友。”

“They can say it another way!” Her eyes glanced at the chocolate makings. “And so can you.”

“他们可以用另一种方式说！”她的目光扫过巧克力制作材料。“你也可以。”

“Hikari wouldn’t have cared if Touji gave chocolates to the other girls. The same with Hyuga and Misato,” he whispered, ignoring the pain in his chest.

“即使冬二把巧克力送给其他女孩，光也不会在意。对于日向和三笠也是一样，”他低声说道，无视胸口的痛楚。

The redhead recoiled like she had been slapped in the face. Throwing the plastic to the floor, her fists clenched and her eyes narrowed, she stepped forward. This time the boy gave ground, stopping when he hit the table. Yet when she spoke it wasn’t with anger.

红发女孩仿佛被扇了一巴掌般后退，将塑料扔到地上，拳头紧握，眼神锐利，她向前迈步。这次男孩退让了，直到撞到桌子才停下。然而，当她开口时，语气中并无怒意。

“I am not Misato or Hikari. I am Asuka Langley Soryu, your girlfriend,” she choked on the last word. “Or doesn’t that mean anything to you anymore?”

“我不是葛城或光。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你的女朋友，”她哽咽着说出最后那个词。“还是说，这对你已经没有任何意义了？”

“It doesn’t give you the right to control my life.” Shinji instantly regretted his words. But as he opened his mouth to explain what he meant, his head jerked to the side and he slid to the floor. Looking up in a daze, he saw Asuka standing above him.

“这并不意味着你有权控制我的生活。” 碇真嗣立刻后悔说出这些话。但当他张开嘴想要解释自己的意思时，他的头突然偏向一边，整个人滑倒在地。他晕乎乎地抬头望去，只见明日香站在他面前。

“You asshole, how could you…” She wiped at her tears. “Do you know what it did to me when you accepted those chocolates? It made me feel worthless, that all the times you told me you loved me didn’t mean anything. It felt like I didn’t have all your love, though you had all of mine.” The girl walked away, stopping for a moment. “I felt betrayed and after I told you I would never betray your feelings.”

“你这个混蛋，你怎么能……”她擦了擦眼泪。“你知道你接受那些巧克力时我是什么感受吗？我觉得自己一文不值，你曾说爱我的那些时刻都毫无意义。感觉就像我没有得到你全部的爱，尽管我已倾尽所有给你。”女孩转身离去，中途停顿了一下。“我感到被背叛了，尤其在我告诉你我永远不会背叛你的感情之后。”

Shinji watched the girl leave in a rush, her hair trailing behind her. Sitting up, he placed a hand on his stinging cheek before withdrawing it, his palm bloody. But none of that compare to the hurt that he was feeling in his heart. Standing, he went out into the living room to find it empty.

真嗣看着女孩急匆匆地离开，她的头发在身后飘扬。他坐起身，用手捂住刺痛的脸颊，然后抽回手，掌心沾满了血。但这些都比不上他心中的痛苦。站起来，他走进客厅，发现那里空无一人。

“Asuka, I do love you.”

“Asuka，我确实爱你。”

March 14, 2019

Shinji walked out of his room, dressed for school but not really wanting to go. He glanced at Asuka’s door wondering if she would be at school and what she would say. It had been four days since their fight, and he didn’t know where she was. Misato had told him to get over it, that it was time for them to have a fight, especially over something like White Day. She had said Asuka was fine and would return when she wanted to.

真嗣走出自己的房间，虽然穿好了校服，但并不想去学校。他瞥了一眼明日香的房门，思索着她是否会在学校，以及她会说些什么。自从他们吵架以来已经过去了四天，他不知道她去了哪里。美里告诉他要放下这件事，说他们之间是时候该吵一架了，尤其是在白色情人节这样的事情上。她告诉他明日香没事，想回来的时候自然会回来。

“I’m leaving,” he said out of habit, walking out the door.

“我要走了，”他习惯性地说着，走出了门。

“Shinji.”

The boy spun around at hearing his name to see Asuka leaning against the wall next to the door. She was dressed for school but looked drained of energy, her body limp. The auburn hair that normally shined was dull while her eyes were puffy and had black circles underneath them. He trembled when she moved away from the wall to stand in front of him. The girl’s eyes glanced at the bag in his hand, her hands clenching her schoolbag tighter.

男孩听到自己的名字，转身一看，发现明日香正靠在门旁的墙上。她穿着校服，但显得精疲力尽，身体无力地垂着。平日里闪耀的红褐色头发此刻黯淡无光，眼睛肿胀，眼圈发黑。当她从墙边移步到他面前时，他不禁颤抖起来。女孩的目光扫过他手中的包，双手更紧地握住了自己的书包。

“Asuka…”

“Do you love me?” she asked, quietly.

“你爱我吗？”她轻声问道。

He answered immediately. “Yes, I love you, Asuka.”

他立刻回答：“是的，我爱你，明日香。”

She stepped closer, allowing him to see the pain in her eyes. “Then please, don’t do this. I don’t care if the girls hate me but don’t put me through this, please.”

她走近了一些，让他看清她眼中的痛苦。“那么，请不要这样做。我不在乎那些女孩是否恨我，但请不要让我经历这些，求你了。”

“I can’t,” he commented. “I don’t like seeing you like this when it’s my fault but it would be more than rude if I didn’t give something in return.”

“我做不到，”他评论道。“看到你这样我很心疼，毕竟这是我的错，但如果我不有所表示，那就太失礼了。”

The girl nodded. “I knew you were going to say that, which is why…” She took a step closer to him. “You’re going to give me a promise.”

女孩点了点头。“我就知道你会这么说，所以……”她朝他走近一步。“你要给我一个承诺。”

“What kind of promise would that be?” he asked.

“那会是怎样的承诺呢？”他问道。

“You refuse any gift from any girl from this day forward,” Asuka said, her voice gaining in strength. “No accepting anything on Valentine’s Day again. No birthday or holiday presents. If you can’t make that promise, I don’t think I can…”

“从今往后，你拒绝任何女孩的任何礼物，”明日香说，她的声音越发坚定。“再也不要接受情人节礼物。不要生日或节日礼物。如果你不能做出这个承诺，我想我无法……”

“Okay,” he agreed.

“You’re just promising like that?” she asked.

“你就这么承诺吗？”她问道。

“Yes, I’ll agree if it’s the only way to reassure you.” He looked down, ashamed. “These last few days have been terrible. I missed you, your presence in the apartment.”

“是的，如果这是唯一能让你安心的方式，我会同意。”他低下头，感到羞愧。“最近这几天太糟糕了。我想念你，想念你在公寓里的身影。”

“Good, maybe that’ll teach you,” she said before walking past him. “Let’s go, we don’t want to be late.” With that the redhead strode toward the elevators, not waiting for Shinji to catch up.

“好，或许这能让你长记性。”她说完便从他身边走过。“走吧，我们可不想迟到。”话音刚落，那位红发女子便大步向电梯走去，没有等真嗣跟上。

- - - -

"I hate this holiday" Asuka complained.

"我讨厌这个节日" 明日香抱怨道。

The redhead and Shinji were walking through the school grounds during lunch, delivering small packages. The boy carried a bag that was half full of colorful boxes with little bows on them. But while he kept a smile on his face as he gave each girl a box, she wore a frown and glared at the females, not even sparing her friends. When the boy turned she scowled at the frustration on his face.

红发女孩和真嗣在午餐时间穿过校园，递送小包裹。男孩提着一个半满的袋子，里面装着色彩缤纷的盒子，上面系着小蝴蝶结。尽管他在给每个女孩递盒子时都面带微笑，她却皱着眉头，瞪着那些女生，连朋友也不例外。当男孩转过身时，她对他脸上的挫败感怒目而视。

"Then why are you here?" he asked.

"那你为什么在这里？"他问道。

Anger flashed in her eyes for a moment. "Because I want to make it clear I don’t like others flirting with you.”

她的眼中闪过一丝怒火，说道：“因为我想表明我不喜欢别人对你调情。”

"Don’t do this," growled Shinji in frustration. "I don’t want to argue with you again."

别这样，" 真嗣懊恼地低吼，"我不想再和你争吵了。

"Well then you already know my feelings regarding this subject," she retorted. “I hate repeating myself but I will say this one more time. You are mine, Shinji Ikari.

"那么你已经知道我对这个问题的看法了，"她反驳道。“我讨厌重复自己，但我会再说一次。你是我的，碇真嗣。”

"Asuka, it's not like that." He backed away as she stalked toward him.

"明日香，不是那样的。"他后退着，而她步步紧逼。

"Bullshit!" She kept her voice to a low growl, but even then students glanced at them. "These girls are flirting with you. Or haven’t you noticed that in the last hours? How they graciously accept your gift. If I wasn’t here I know a couple girls would have kissed you!” She grabbed his shirt. “So don't give me that crap about how they're just friends. They're hoping that if we have trouble you'll remember how nice they were to you and come running. It's stupid!"

胡说八道！" 她压低声音咆哮，但即便如此，学生们还是朝他们瞥了一眼。"这些女孩在跟你调情。难道你几个小时都没注意到吗？她们优雅地接受你的礼物。如果我不在，我知道有几个女孩会亲你！" 她抓住他的衬衫。"所以别跟我说她们只是朋友这种鬼话。她们希望如果我们遇到麻烦，你会记得她们对你有多好，然后跑来找她们。真是愚蠢！

"So you're saying Hikari is flirting with me?" he asked quietly, watching as she blushed.

"所以你是说光在跟我调情？" 他轻声问道，看着她脸红。

"Well no, but that's..." 嗯，不，但是那是...

"Asuka. Shinji."

The teens turned at the voice, glad that someone had broken up the argument before something was said that couldn't be taken back. They saw Maki coming at them at a slow jog, a smile on her face and dragging a boy. Asuka smiled at her friend, knowing she was one of the few girls that wasn’t interested in Shinji. She slid her hand over his, squeezing gently as the two students came to a halt in front of them. The boy stood there catching his breath and trying hopelessly to hide his embarrassment.

青少年们听到声音转过身来，庆幸有人及时制止了争吵，避免了说出无法收回的话。他们看到 Maki 带着微笑，拖着一个男孩慢跑过来。Asuka 对她的朋友微笑，知道她是少数对 Shinji 不感兴趣的女孩之一。她把手滑到他的手上，轻轻地捏了一下，当这两个学生在他们面前停下来时。男孩站在那里喘着气，徒劳地试图掩饰他的尴尬。

"Hello Maki. I see you found someone." Her smile grew as the girl pulled her boyfriend to the front.

"你好，Maki。看来你找到了某人。" 她的笑容随着女孩拉着男友走到前面而扩大。

"Yeah, Ryo finally asked me today." Maki stepped closer to Asuka. "I want to thank you for your help."

“是啊，Ryo 今天终于向我表白了。” Maki 向 Asuka 走近了一步，“我想感谢你的帮助。”

"I just told you what not to do, nothing else." She gritted her teeth as Shinji held out a box.

“我刚告诉了你不要做什么，别的没了。”她咬紧牙关，而真嗣递过来一个盒子。

"Thank you." The girl took the box and backed away. "We'll leave you two alone, bye." Her smile was mischievous as she looked at the two of them. “Don’t get too rough with each other.”

"谢谢你。" 女孩接过盒子，退后几步。"我们不打扰你们俩了，再见。" 她看着他们俩，笑容中带着一丝淘气。"别太粗暴哦。"

Shinji turned to Asuka only after the red faded from his cheeks. "Advice on relationships from you?"

真嗣直到脸颊上的红晕消退后才转向明日香，"你给我关于恋爱的建议？"

"It's not really advice, more like what not to do. I've plenty of experience in making mistakes with people." She gave him a crooked smile. “Still I think she’s disappointed that I got to you before her. The way she looks at you, I know she had a crush on you, Shinji. But she let it go instead of trying to force us apart. And for that I respect her.” Before he could say a word, she thrust a list under his nose. "You need to learn how to write better. I can't even read next name."

“这不算什么建议，更像是告诉你哪些不该做。我在与人相处上犯过的错可多了。”她朝他歪嘴一笑，“不过我觉得她挺失望的，毕竟是我先接近了你。她看你的眼神，我知道她对你动过心，真嗣。但她选择了放手，没有试图拆散我们，就凭这一点，我敬重她。”他还没来得及开口，她就把一张清单塞到他眼前，“你得学学怎么写好字，下一个名字我都看不清了。”

He took the paper, puzzled. "It's to Yuki Takashi," he read, puzzled. "Is something the matter Asuka? I've noticed that you have trouble making out…some words lately."

他接过纸条，一脸困惑。“这是给雪·高桥的，”他念道，同样不解。“有什么问题吗，飞鸟？我注意到你最近有些字认不出来……”

"Nothing's wrong," she commented. "Now let's finish this stupid delivery so I can eat lunch." She grabbed his arm and yanked. "Hurry up, idiot."

"没什么问题，" 她回应道，"现在赶紧把这无聊的快递送完，我好去吃午饭。" 她抓住他的胳膊一拽，"快点，笨蛋。"

Ten minutes later the pair was sitting at a table, done with their deliveries. With her chopsticks, Asuka drew designs in her rice and picked at her lunch. Bored she watched Shinji eat his lunch in little bites, never wasting energy or motion. Lifting a piece of shrimp, she ate it without enthusiasm before dipping down for some vegetables. Kicking her feet, she brushed against his leg, causing him to look up.

十分钟后，两人已经坐在桌旁，完成了送货任务。明日香用筷子在米饭上画着图案，一边挑拣着午餐。她无聊地看着真嗣小口吃着午餐，从不浪费一丝精力或动作。她夹起一只虾，无精打采地吃下，然后又夹了些蔬菜。她踢着脚，不经意间碰到了他的腿，让他抬头看过来。

"I've been wondering," she started. "Why you didn't give Rei any chocolates?"

我一直很好奇，" 她开口道，"为什么你没有给玲任何巧克力呢？

"I did."

"Then how come I didn't see it?" She watched as he turned red. "Well?"

那我怎么没看见呢？" 她看着他脸红起来。"怎么了？

"Umm…the reason is because…" he looked away and blurted out. "You were in the bathroom."

嗯……原因是……" 他转过头，脱口而出，"因为你当时在洗手间。

"Oh…still you could have waited."

哦……你本可以再等等的。

He played with his food, but didn’t eat it. "I thought you still hated Rei and I didn't want any hard feelings between the two of you."

他玩弄着食物，却未曾下咽。“我以为你还是讨厌零，不想你们之间有任何芥蒂。”

"I don't hate her," she said slowly. "We still have differences and she's hard to talk to, but we're slowly becoming friends."

"我并不讨厌她，"她缓缓地说，"我们之间仍有分歧，她也不太好沟通，但我们正慢慢成为朋友。"

"That's good." He flinched at her glare, the calm gone from her face. "What?"

“挺好的。”他因她的怒视而退缩，她脸上的平静消失了。“怎么了？”

"Speaking of chocolates and such, where’s mine?" she asked in a low voice. "Everyone else gets some, but your girlfriend doesn't?"

说到巧克力和这些，我的呢？"她低声问道。"别人都有，你女朋友就没有吗？

"Actually I was going to cover myself in chocolate and give myself to you tonight," he said with a straight face, not even smiling as Asuka winced at the mental image.

"其实我打算今晚把自己涂满巧克力送给你，"他一本正经地说，连一丝笑容都没有，而明日香则因为脑海中的画面皱起了眉头。

"That's disgusting, Shinji," she retorted, shuddering. "Who'd want to suck candy off your…"

太恶心了，真嗣，" 她反驳道，浑身颤抖。"谁会想从你的……

"Asuka. Shinji."

The redhead jumped, turning at the quiet voice to see Rei standing behind them. She felt her face heat up, and saw Shinji's doing the same, as they both knew their friend had heard the conversation. The proof was the slight blush on Rei’s cheeks. The only good thing was that neither Touji nor Kensuke had heard that comment because if they had, the two EVA pilots would never live it down. Looking out of the corner of her eye, the redhead saw that her boyfriend would be of no help.

红发少女一惊，转身望向那轻声呼唤之处，只见绫波站在身后。她感到脸颊发烫，瞥见真嗣亦是如此，两人心知好友已听见了对话。证据便是绫波脸颊上淡淡的绯红。唯一庆幸的是，东治和健介并未听见那番话，否则两位 EVA 驾驶员将永难摆脱这尴尬。红发少女用余光一瞥，意识到男友此刻也帮不上忙。

"Hello Rei. What'd you want?" she asked with a cheery voice.

"你好，绫波。你想干嘛？" 她用欢快的声音问道。

"I wanted to report that I was unable to cancel the tests and physicals for tonight. I am sorry." Rei's voice betrayed no hint of emotion to what she had just heard.

我想报告一下，今晚的测试和体检我未能取消。很抱歉。" 丽的声音没有透露出任何她刚听到的情绪。

"Why'd you go to so much trouble to cancel them?" Asuka asked, puzzled at Rei's actions.

"你为什么要费这么大劲去取消它们？" 明日香问道，对绫波的行为感到困惑。

"I was under the impression that you and Shinji would have wanted to spend time together, or that is what Sub-commander Katsuragi said when I asked her. She said something about the two of you having some fun tonight." She tilted her head and smiled. "Though I fail to understand the fun of Shinji covering himself in chocolate or you sucking something of his." The other teens' jaws dropped at the comment. "Good bye."

我原以为你和真嗣会想一起度过时光，或者这就是我问副指挥官葛城时她所说的。她说你们俩今晚会有点乐子。"她歪着头微笑道，"虽然我不明白真嗣把自己涂满巧克力或你吸吮他身上的东西有什么乐趣。"其他青少年的下巴都惊掉了。"再见。

"Does she even understand what we were talking about?" moaned Asuka, her head in her hands while Rei walked away. "Please, tell me she didn't just hint at us doing something perverted?”

她真的明白我们在说什么吗？"阿苏卡哀叹着，双手捂着脸，而丽则走开了。"拜托，告诉我她没有暗示我们做些下流的事？

"I-I think she was joking with us," commented Shinji still in shock.

"我-我觉得她是在跟我们开玩笑，" 真嗣仍然震惊地说道。

"Don't say that! You know what I was saying," she shot back. "Wondergirl developing a twisted sense of humor?" She glared at him. “Next thing you know Hikari will be asking those things.”

别这么说！你知道我指的是什么，" 她反驳道。"难道奇迹少女开始有扭曲的幽默感了？" 她瞪着他。"接下来你可能会听到光问那些问题了。

“Doubtful, she isn’t like that at all,” he said before groaning.

“她根本不是那样的，”他叹了口气说道。

“What?”

“Nothing, except tonight is ruined. We won’t get back to the apartment until at least eight or nine o’clock.”

“没什么，只是今晚被毁了。我们至少要到八九点才能回到公寓。”

“Yeah, it sucks,” Asuka agreed. “Let me guess, you had plans?”

“是啊，真糟糕，” 明日香同意道。“让我猜猜，你原本有计划？”

“Yeah…”

“What were they?” she asked, grinning.

“那些计划是什么？” 她笑着问道。

“It’s a secret,” he replied.

“这是个秘密，”他回答道。

The girl got up and circled the table, stopping when she was in front of Shinji, who had turned around. Giving him her best glare, she stood there tapping her foot in anger. Leaning down, she stopped before their noses touched and waited for some response. She smiled when he swallowed and tried to turn his head but her hands kept him from moving.

女孩站起身，绕着桌子走了一圈，停在转过身来的真嗣面前。她用最严厉的目光瞪着他，愤怒地站在那里跺着脚。她俯下身，在两人的鼻子即将触碰之际停下，等待着他的反应。看到他吞咽口水试图转头，而她的手却阻止了他移动，她露出了微笑。

“I think you should tell me,” she growled. Shinji shook his head. “And why not?”

“我觉得你应该告诉我，”她低吼道。真嗣摇了摇头。“为什么不呢？”

“Because I can still pull it off,” he explained with a smile. He winced at the increased pressure.

“因为我还能应付得来，”他微笑着解释道。他因压力增大而皱了皱眉。

“I better be surprised after what you put me through recently,” Asuka said with a dangerous gleam in her eyes. “You owe me.”

“经历了你最近给我带来的种种，我最好能得到一个惊喜，”明日香说着，眼中闪烁着危险的光芒。“你欠我的。”

“You will be,” Shinji stated, getting up a moment later when the bell rang. “I promise.”

“你会的，”真嗣断言道，片刻后铃声响起，他站起身来。“我保证。”

Asuka lay stretched out on the floor, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, staring at a blank wall. Every once in awhile, she let out a moan and shuddered as Shinji's fingers found certain spots on her body. He had been right in telling her that she would be surprised that night. Some snuggling on the couch watching a movie had followed a wonderful dinner, all of which ended with her on the floor getting a massage. She had always thought she was relaxed in life but as his hands found tight muscles and worked them out, she started feeling like putty. In fact, it felt so good she could barely keep her eyes open.

明日香躺在地板上，身着短裤和 T 恤，凝视着空白的墙壁。偶尔，她会发出一声呻吟，身体随之颤抖，因为真嗣的手指触碰到了她身上的某些敏感点。他之前告诉她，那晚她会感到惊喜，这话一点没错。一顿美妙的晚餐后，他们在沙发上依偎着看电影，而这一切的尾声是她躺在地板上享受按摩。她一直以为自己生活得很放松，但当他的双手找到紧绷的肌肉并加以舒缓时，她开始感觉自己像一团柔软的泥。事实上，那种舒适感如此强烈，她几乎睁不开眼睛。

“You have such wonderful fingers, Shinji,” she said lazily. “I wonder if we could find other uses for them.”

“你的手指真漂亮，真嗣，”她慵懒地说。“我在想，我们还能用它们做些什么。”

“I’m sure we could,” he replied, moving her silky hair off to one side. “Let’s wait until later to find those uses.”

“我确信我们可以，”他回答道，将她丝滑的秀发拨到一边，“我们晚些时候再找那些用途吧。”

“Umm,” moaned the girl. “That was a nice dinner you made.”

“嗯，”女孩呻吟道，“你做的晚餐真不错。”

“Thanks.”

Asuka had come home from her tests and physicals exhausted, and wanting to sleep but she forced herself to stay awake. The smell of food had greeted her when she left the bathroom after soaking for an hour. She had quickly gone to her room to get dressed before making her way to the kitchen. The table was full of food from salads and soups to steak and shrimp, while dessert had been a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. She had simply eaten as much as possible before walking to the living room. In fact, what was left of the food was still on the table.

明日香做完测试和体检后疲惫不堪，本想睡觉，却强迫自己保持清醒。她泡澡一小时后从浴室出来时，闻到了食物的香味。她迅速回房间换好衣服，然后走向厨房。餐桌上摆满了从沙拉、汤到牛排和虾的各种美食，甜点则是巧克力蛋糕配香草冰淇淋。她尽可能多地吃了些，然后走到客厅。事实上，剩下的食物还摆在桌上。

“How’d you afford everything?” she asked quietly.

“你怎么负担得起这一切？”她轻声问道。

“I do get a salary.”

“我确实有工资。”

“I know that, but the steaks alone would have cost a fortune,” Asuka pointed out. “Your bank account must be empty.”

“我知道，但光是那些牛排就得花一大笔钱，”明日香指出。“你的银行账户肯定空了吧。”

“Not when you kill the steer yourself.”

“自己宰杀牛的时候就不会了。”

The redhead turned to stare. “You’re not cut out to be a comedian.”

红发人转过身来凝视着说：“你并不适合当喜剧演员。”

“Honestly though, my account isn’t empty. I do have a year’s pay saved up,” he explained.

“老实说，我的账户并非空空如也。我确实存了一年的工资，”他解释道。

“So did you buy me a car?” she joked.

“那么，你给我买了辆车吗？”她打趣道。

“Uh, no. That’s a little too expensive.”

“呃，没有。那有点太贵了。”

“Oh well, I’m allowed to dream aren’t I?” she said before moaning as his fingers found a tight spot on her lower back. “You’re getting a little adventurous, Shinji.”

“唉，我做做梦总可以吧？”她在他手指触到腰背紧绷处时轻声呻吟，随后说道，“真嗣，你倒是越来越大胆了。”

“Sorry,” he replied, moving his hands back up her back. “Anyway we’re allowed to use Misato’s old car as long as we get permission first. Can we talk about something else now?”

“抱歉，”他回应着，将手移回她的背部，“对了，只要事先得到许可，我们就可以用美里姐的旧车。现在能换个话题了吗？”

“Why? I love talking about money, especially when I do my two favorite things with it: eating, and shopping,” she explained.

“为什么呢？我特别喜欢谈论钱，尤其是当我用它做我最喜欢的两件事时：吃和购物，”她解释道。

“Then how come you’re not fat if you like to eat so much?” he asked, feeling her tense under his hands. “Let me explain. I don’t want you to be fat, but with the amount of food you eat you should weigh a lot more.”

“那你既然这么喜欢吃，怎么没变胖呢？”他问道，感觉到她在他手下紧张起来。“让我解释一下。我并不是希望你变胖，但按照你吃的食物量，你应该重得多。”

“I just have a high metabolism, but it sounds like you want me to gain weight. Is that true?” she asked slyly.

“我只是新陈代谢快，但听起来你似乎想让我增重。是这样吗？”她狡黠地问道。

“I just said no!” he retorted. “I like you the way you are.

“我刚刚说了不！”他反驳道，“我就喜欢你现在的样子。”

Asuka smiled at how fast Shinji had recovered from his slip. The redhead didn’t want to be told that she was skin and bones or fat from her boyfriend. Though he was correct in that she never seemed to gain weight, no matter how much she ate. Sure she had gained weight after waking up but once she had reached a certain weight, gaining a couple pounds took months. She enjoyed listening to the girls that moaned about gaining a few pounds and how they would have to go on a diet.

明日香看着真嗣这么快就从滑倒中恢复过来，不禁微笑。她可不想听男友说自己骨瘦如柴或是胖了。虽然他说的没错，无论她吃多少，似乎都不会长胖。确实，醒来后她是增重了，但一旦达到某个体重，再增加几磅就得花上好几个月。她喜欢听那些女孩抱怨自己胖了几磅，嚷嚷着要节食。

What was even more fun was to listen to the girls at school wishing they had her body, not realizing that her beauty came naturally and had nothing to do with working out. Asuka couldn’t help that she had toned legs, perfect skin, and perky breasts. A couple of times she had overheard a few girls talking about extreme measures once they graduated. That had made her smile, knowing she would never have to stoop to that level.

更有趣的是，听到学校里的女生们羡慕她那副身材，却未意识到她的美貌是天生的，与锻炼无关。明日香无法控制自己拥有紧致的双腿、完美的肌肤和挺拔的胸部。有几次，她无意中听到一些女生在毕业后打算采取极端措施的谈话。这让她不禁微笑，因为她知道自己永远不会沦落到那种地步。

“Speaking of weight and bodies, how’d your physical go?” he asked after a few minutes of silence.

“说到体重和身材，你的体检怎么样了？”几分钟后，他打破了沉默问道。

“Thanks, Shinji,” she groaned, sitting up. “I wanted to forget that but you just had to bring it up.”

“谢谢你，真嗣，”她呻吟着坐起身来，“我本想忘记那件事，你却非要提起。”

“Why?”

“Because doctors are perverts!” she said in frustration. “They’re always poking and prodding my body. Not to mention they have cold hands and disapproving eyes.” She flopped onto her back. “Even when you’ve done nothing wrong they look at you like you’re hiding something.”

“因为医生都是变态！”她沮丧地说，“他们总是戳戳碰碰我的身体。更别提他们那冰冷的手和挑剔的眼神了。”她猛地躺倒在床上，“即使你什么都没做错，他们看你的眼神就像你藏着什么似的。”

“I think you’re blowing things out of proportion, Asuka. Not all doctors have cold hands.” He smiled at her glare. “Besides they’re just looking out for our health and don’t want to be caught off guard.”

“我觉得你有点小题大做了，明日香。并非所有医生的手都是冰冷的。”他对着她怒视的目光微笑道，“再说，他们只是关心我们的健康，不想措手不及而已。”

“Maybe, but I still hate going to the doctor.” She sighed. “At least my personal life is still private. The last thing I need is for them to ask about my sex life.”

“或许吧，但我还是讨厌去看医生。”她叹了口气，“至少我的私生活还是保密的。我最不需要的就是他们来询问我的性生活。”

“I hope they don’t ask.” His face went red as he envisioned that scene.

“我希望他们不要问。” 他想象着那个场景，脸都红了。

“What’s the matter, Shinji, embarrassed?” she teased. “You should get used to those questions. God, the way the girls act at school is impossible. Don’t tell me the boys haven’t been inquiring about us.”

“怎么了，真嗣，害羞了吗？” 她打趣道。“你应该习惯那些问题。天哪，学校里女生的行为真是让人难以忍受。别告诉我男生们没有打听过我们。”

“Well, yeah, but…”

“I just hope you don’t act this nervous when we do it.” Despite her calm voice, her face was red. “I mean I don’t want to be lying in bed with my eyes closed, waiting for you to take my virginity, only to open them to see you running away.”

“我只希望你到时候不要这么紧张。”尽管她的声音很平静，但她的脸却红了。“我的意思是，我不想躺在床上闭着眼睛，等着你夺走我的初夜，结果一睁眼却看到你跑掉了。”

Shinji felt his eyes bulge out at her blunt statement. “Well…I don’t think I’ll be like that, especially if we keep talking about it.” He cleared his throat. “So are you healthy?”

听到她直白的陈述，真嗣感到自己的眼睛都要瞪出来了。“嗯……我觉得我不会那样，特别是如果我们继续讨论这件事的话。”他清了清嗓子。“那么，你健康吗？”

“Yeah, except I need glasses,” she said, looking away.

“是的，只是我需要眼镜，”她说着，目光移向别处。

He sat there stunned. “G-g-glasses?”

他坐在那里，目瞪口呆。“眼...眼镜？”

“Yes, glasses, just for reading but I’ll probably have to wear them all the time soon. I can hear the taunts at school already,” she muttered.

“是的，眼镜，只是为了阅读，但可能很快我就得一直戴着它们了。我已经能听到学校里的嘲笑了，”她低声说道。

“I think you’ll look cute in glasses,” Shinji stated, blushing.

“我觉得你戴眼镜会很可爱，”真嗣说道，脸颊泛红。

“You think I look cute in anything.”

“你认为我穿什么都可爱。”

“Not everything. Purple doesn’t go with your hair or skin, neither does neon green or brown. I also don’t see you wearing anything in camouflage or combat boots. Then there are those shirts that look like you’re wearing a tent. Ow!” He rubbed his arm where she had just punched him. “What was that for?”

“并非如此。紫色与你的发色或肤色不搭，荧光绿和棕色也一样。我也从没见你穿过迷彩服或军靴。还有那些看起来像帐篷的衬衫。哎哟！”他揉了揉被她刚打过的手臂。“你打我干嘛？”

“Nothing,” she said laughing. “I guess I can count on you for an honest opinion.”

“没什么，”她笑着说，“我想我可以指望你给个真诚的意见。”

“Yep, I rely on you for the same.” He stood up. “Wait here, I’ve got to go get your present.”

“是的，我也同样依赖你。”他站起身来，“在这儿等着，我去拿你的礼物。”

Asuka nodded, reaching for the remote and turning on the television set. Shinji didn’t know how glad she was the doctor hadn’t asked about her sex life. She didn’t want to have to go through a certain examination quite yet or answer weird questions. Sure she had finally accepted her body and that certain things were needed to maintain her health, but that didn’t mean she wanted to talk about her private life with some doctor. She couldn’t believe she used to act like a little ignorant girl concerning her body, hating her period because she didn’t want children. Though she was still scared of having children in the future. Sighing, she shut the set off after finding nothing interesting on her favorite channels and waited for the boy to return. She perked up when she heard his footsteps approaching.

明日香点了点头，伸手拿起遥控器打开了电视机。真嗣并不知道她有多庆幸医生没有问及她的性生活。她还不愿接受某些检查，也不想回答奇怪的问题。虽然她终于接受了自己的身体，明白有些事情是为了保持健康所必需的，但这并不意味着她愿意与某个医生谈论自己的私生活。她无法相信自己曾经像个无知的小女孩一样对待自己的身体，因为不想生孩子而讨厌月经。尽管她对未来生孩子仍感到恐惧。叹了口气，她在喜欢的频道上没找到什么有趣的内容后便关掉了电视，等待男孩回来。当她听到他的脚步声接近时，她精神一振。

“Here you go.” “给你。”

Shinji placed two white rectangular boxes in front of Asuka before sitting across from her. He watched as the girl reached out and untied the bow and ribbon that held the boxes together. She slowly lifted the lid off, placing it to the side before unfolding the tissue paper. Her eyes widened at seeing the designer silk blouse she had been looking at for a couple weeks. The teen lifted it out to view it better and saw something below the shirt. She grabbed two movies and raised an eyebrow at what she saw next.

真嗣在明日香面前放下了两个白色的长方形盒子，然后坐在她对面。他看着女孩伸出手，解开了系着盒子的蝴蝶结和丝带。她缓缓掀开盖子，放到一边，然后展开了包装纸。看到那件她已经关注了几周的设计师丝绸衬衫，她的眼睛睁大了。少女将其取出以便更好地观赏，并发现衬衫下面还有东西。她抓起两部电影，对接下来看到的东西挑了挑眉。

“And what are these for?” she asked, holding up some panties, in various colors.

“这些又是干什么用的？”她问道，手里举着各种颜色的内裤。

“To wear of course. Think of all the compliments you’d get from the girls,” he said, grinning widely.

“当然是用来穿的。想想看，你会从女孩们那里得到多少赞美，”他笑着说，笑容满面。

“You mean the rumors,” she replied blandly. “Is this my present?”

“你是说那些流言吗，”她平淡地回答。“这是我的礼物吗？”

“There’s more and you’ll know when you get to the real present.

“那里还有更多，当你真正接触到礼物时就会明白。

Asuka sighed and went back to the box. After the underwear, she found some music and magazines. The redhead opened the next box to see a pair each of jeans and slacks. She wanted to be angry with Shinji as she pulled out a white lace and silk nightgown that would leave little to the imagination. Instead the girl was flattered that he had gone to so much trouble, taking satisfaction in knowing he would have been embarrassed buying the lingerie.

明日香叹了口气，回到箱子旁。在整理完内衣后，她发现了一些音乐和杂志。红发女孩打开下一个箱子，里面有一条牛仔裤和一条休闲裤。当她拿出一件白色蕾丝真丝睡裙时，本想对真嗣发火，因为这件睡裙几乎遮不住什么。然而，女孩却感到受宠若惊，因为他费了这么多心思，她可以想象到他购买这些内衣时会有多尴尬，这让她感到满足。

“Trying to suggest something, Shinji?” she asked, smiling.

“想提什么建议吗，真嗣？”她笑着问道。

“I remember our promise, so don’t worry.”

“我记得我们的承诺，所以不用担心。”

The girl nodded, returning to the box and her presents. As she set the nightgown down, the girl wondered where her grand surprise was; picking the box up she heard an object move inside. Reaching in, she grabbed the small box out of the tissue paper. Lifting the long narrow box, she swallowed, knowing what these boxes normally contained. With trembling fingers, the redhead pried the lid off and stared wide-eyed in shock at what she found. A silver bracelet was lying on velvet, glittering in the light. The double helix design made it look very delicate while small sapphires were set between the intertwined bands.

女孩点了点头，回到箱子旁，面对着她的礼物。当她放下睡裙时，女孩疑惑着她的惊喜究竟在哪里；拿起箱子，她听到里面有东西移动的声音。伸手进去，她从纸巾中取出了一个小盒子。举起那个细长的盒子，她咽了口口水，知道这类盒子通常装着什么。红发女孩用颤抖的手指撬开盖子，睁大眼睛，震惊地看着里面的东西。一条银质手镯躺在天鹅绒上，在灯光下闪闪发光。双螺旋设计使其显得非常精致，而小蓝宝石则镶嵌在交织的带子之间。

“Oh, Shinji, it’s beautiful,” she said dreamily.

“哦，真嗣，它真美，”她梦幻般地说道。

“Told you you’d be surprised,” he replied, reaching out to take box from her hand. Slowly, he fastened the bracelet around her wrist, getting a kiss when he was done.

“我早就说过你会惊讶的，”他回答道，伸手从她手中接过盒子。他慢慢地将手链系在她的手腕上，完成后得到了一个吻。

Later that night, the door to the apartment slid open and two figures walked in. They paused to look at the mess in the kitchen before continuing down the hall. Misato stopped in front of Shinji’s door, contemplating if she should open the door and check on them. When Rei had come asking for the tests to be postponed, the Sub-commander had joked about how if that happened, then Asuka and Shinji would have more time for fun. But now that she stood outside his door she thought maybe the tests had made them more restless.

那天深夜，公寓的门悄然滑开，两个身影走了进来。他们在厨房的凌乱前停顿片刻，然后继续沿着走廊前行。美里在真嗣的门前驻足，思索是否应该开门查看。当零来请求推迟测试时，副司令曾戏言，若真如此，明日香和真嗣便有更多时间寻欢作乐。然而此刻站在门外，她却觉得或许是测试让他们更加心神不宁。

“You think they had fun tonight?” she asked Hyuga.

“你觉得他们今晚玩得开心吗？”她问日向。

“I think they had more fun than you think,” he stated, pointing at the line of discarded clothes. The officer smirked as the trail ended with a pair of boxers and girl’s underwear. “I think you should talk to them about the birds and the bees.”

“我觉得他们比你想象的还要开心，”他指着一排丢弃的衣服说道。警官看到这条线索以一条男式内裤和一条女式内裤结束时，露出了坏笑。“我觉得你应该跟他们谈谈关于鸟和蜜蜂的事。”

“They already know about that. I’m going to kill them if they did,” she hissed, opening the door. “Asuka reassured me that they were…”

“他们已经知道那件事了。如果他们真的知道了，我就要杀了他们，”她低声说着，打开了门。“明日香向我保证过他们……”

Her voice died as she saw the two teens lying on top of the covers, holding each other. She felt her heart slow at noticing that they were clothed but she couldn’t help but notice Asuka’s apparel. The teen was barely covered by the nightgown she was wearing, something that Misato thought wasn’t proper for a girl her age. She wasn’t too thrilled to notice one of Shinji’s hands resting on Asuka’s leg. A cough caused her to turn her head to see her date nervously looking at the scene, with a smile on his face, which caused her to frown.

她的话音戛然而止，因为她看到两个少年躺在被子上，相互依偎。注意到他们衣着整齐，她的心跳缓了下来，但目光还是不由自主地落在了明日香的装束上。少女身上的睡裙几乎遮不住什么，这让美里觉得对于她这个年纪的女孩来说并不合适。她不太高兴地发现真嗣的一只手正搭在明日香的腿上。一声咳嗽让她转过头，看到她的约会对象正紧张地看着这一幕，脸上挂着微笑，这让她皱起了眉头。

“What do you find so interesting?” she whispered harshly. “You shouldn’t be looking at Asuka.”

“你到底觉得有什么好看的？”她严厉地低声说道，“你不应该盯着明日香看。”

“I wasn’t! Sure she’s good looking, but she’s ten years my junior. And anyway, I have…” he gave Misato a kiss, “you.”

“我没有！当然她是很漂亮，但她比我小十岁。再说，我有……”他给了美里一个吻，“你。”

“You didn’t answer the question.” She retorted, still whispering.

“你并没有回答问题。”她反驳道，依旧低声细语。

Hyuga chuckled. “It’s just that he must have nerves of steel. How he can sleep perfectly fine next to a gorgeous girl with no problem is beyond me. I can’t think of anyone else that could do that.”

日向轻笑一声。“只能说他的神经真是钢铁铸就的。旁边躺着一位美女还能安然入睡，我实在无法理解。我想不出还有谁能做到这一点。”

“Hmm, you’re probably right,” she commented, a grin on her face. “But they’re special, and I should really stop worrying about what they do. They’re good kids who deserve happiness.”

“嗯，你说的可能没错，”她笑着评论道，“但他们很特别，我真应该停止担心他们的所作所为。他们是好孩子，值得拥有幸福。”

With that, she closed the door and pulled Hyuga to her room. Back in Shinji’s room two sets of eyes opened once they heard the door close. Asuka shivered in the cool air, causing the boy to pull the blankets over the both of them. They both smiled, snuggling closer under the blanket, sharing body heat and the pillow once again. The girl moved slightly so she could give him a quick kiss.

说完，她关上门，拉着日向进了自己的房间。在真嗣的房间里，当听到门关上的声音时，两双眼睛同时睁开。明日香在凉爽的空气中颤抖，男孩便拉过毯子盖住两人。他们相视而笑，在毯子下依偎得更近，再次共享体温和枕头。女孩轻轻移动，以便能快速亲吻他一下。

“That was fun,” Shinji said after they were finished. Asuka had talked him into playing a small trick on Misato with their clothes. He had been against it until she had told him that she would wear what he had given her. The combination of white underwear and the nightgown had been enough for him to go along with her plans.

“那真有趣，”真嗣在他们结束后说道。明日香说服他一起对美里开个小玩笑，用他们的衣服。他原本反对，直到她告诉他，她会穿上他给她的衣服。白色内衣和睡裙的组合足以让他同意她的计划。

“So do you have nerves of steel?” she asked, resting her head on the pillow.

“那么，你有钢铁般的神经吗？”她问道，头枕在枕头上。

A finger traced its way down from her neck and over a bare shoulder, stopping on her upper arm. “Maybe.”

一根手指从她的颈项缓缓滑下，掠过裸露的肩膀，停在了她的上臂。“或许吧。”

“I can’t wait to see what other surprises you have for me.” She smiled as he lazily traced his finger over her arm. “Goodnight, Shinji.”

“我迫不及待想看看你还有哪些惊喜等着我。”她微笑着，而他则慵懒地用手指在她手臂上划过。“晚安，真嗣。”

He didn’t say anything for a few moments, content with sharing warmth with the girl.

他沉默了一会儿，满足于与女孩共享温暖。

“I’m looking forward to it.”

“我很期待。”

July 2019

Waves crashed against the shore, flowing up the sand before retreating to the expanse of the ocean. Various birds flew over the water, their cries heard in the small town. Rolling hills, covered in trees, framed the resort in green. A blue sky with light fluffy clouds completed a perfect picture that anyone would enjoy. Anyone except one person who pulled the pillow harder against her head, hoping to drown out the sounds. Failing to do that, she turned to lie on her back and stared up at the ceiling, one hand thrown up to block the glare.

海浪拍打着岸边，涌上沙滩后又退回浩瀚的海洋。各种鸟儿在水面上飞翔，它们的鸣叫声在小城中回荡。连绵的丘陵被树木覆盖，绿意盎然地环绕着度假村。蓝天上飘着轻柔的白云，构成了一幅人人都会欣赏的美景。除了一个人，她用力将枕头压在头上，试图隔绝这些声音。未能如愿后，她翻身仰躺，凝视着天花板，一只手举起遮挡刺眼的光线。

“Damn it! I’m trying to recover sleep, not lose it,” Asuka complained to no one.

“该死！我正试图恢复睡眠，而不是失去它，”明日香向着无人处抱怨道。

“You mean you miss having Shinji around,” a girl answered.

“你是说你怀念有真嗣在身边的日子，”一个女孩回答道。

The redhead turned to glare at the girl coming out of the bathroom. She had hoped her roommates had left to meet up with the rest of the class, but no such luck. It must have been earlier than she realized. Pushing the covers off to one side, the teen sat up, holding her head in her hands. Out of the corner of her eye she watched Akane Amamiya, a friend but not a particularly close one, get dressed for the day. The pilot had really wanted to be alone and get some extra sleep, especially since she had stayed up late the night before.

红发少女转头瞪向从浴室出来的女孩。她本希望室友们已经离开去和班上其他人会合，但显然没有这样的运气。一定是她意识到的时间比她以为的要早。她把被子推到一边，坐起身来，双手抱头。眼角余光中，她看着天宫茜，一个朋友但并非特别亲近的那种，为新的一天穿衣打扮。这位飞行员真的很想独自一人，多睡一会儿，尤其是因为她前一晚熬夜到很晚。

“It’s nothing like that. You wouldn’t understand…” Asuka retorted.

“根本不是那样。你不会明白的……” 明日香反驳道。

“What wouldn’t she understand?” Hikari asked as she entered the hotel room. She saw her friend sitting on the edge of the bed. “So you’re finally awake.”

“她不会明白什么？” 光问着，走进了酒店房间。她看到她的朋友坐在床边。“你终于醒了。”

“Nothing,” groaned Asuka, falling backward.

“没什么，”明日香呻吟着向后倒去。

Akane laughed. “She was complaining about wanting to get more sleep and I said it was because Ikari wasn’t…hey!” She ducked as a pillow flew past her head. “It was true.”

“她一直在抱怨想多睡会儿，我就说是因为碇没……嘿！”她低头躲过飞来的枕头。“我说的是实话。”

“No it’s not,” the redhead said tartly. “I didn’t expect my senior year to be so hectic so soon. Not to mention piloting is chewing up my free time. So I’m getting less sleep then normal. It has absolutely nothing to do with Shinji.”

“不，不是的，”红发女孩尖锐地反驳道，“我没想到大四会这么快就变得如此忙碌。更别提驾驶机甲占用我大量空闲时间了。所以我比平时睡得少。这绝对和真嗣无关。”

Hikari shook her head, disappointed. “But this isn’t a vacation, Asuka. It’s our school trip, and that means having to do school work, even if it’s only in a casual manner.”

光失望地摇了摇头，“但这不是度假，明日香。这是我们的学校旅行，意味着即使是以一种随意的方式，我们也得做学校作业。”

“It’s a vacation for me,” emphasized the girl. “I finally got out of that city, the apartment and away from LCL.” She smiled continuing to list off her reasons. “No Misato to check up on us. No United Nations officers to run us through various scenarios. Compared to a typical day, this is a vacation and I’m going to enjoy it.”

“对我来说，这是一次度假，”女孩强调道。“我终于离开了那座城市、那个公寓，远离了 LCL。”她微笑着继续列举她的理由。“没有美里来查岗，没有联合国官员给我们安排各种情景。与平常的日子相比，这就是度假，我要好好享受。”

“That’s nice,” Akane said, heading for the door. “I’m out of here so I’ll see you two at the docks.”

“真不错，”阿卡内说着，朝门口走去。“我要走了，码头见。”

Hikari watched the girl leave before turning back to her friend, only to see her disappear into the bathroom. Sighing, she moved to her dresser to pack a bag for a day of scuba diving and exploring the local reefs that were growing out in the ruins. As the shower started up, she stripped out of her clothes and slipped into her swimsuit. They had been told to come prepared to leave as soon as possible and that had meant to be dressed properly. Biting her lip, she studied the carpeted floor.

光看着女孩离开后，转头望向她的朋友，却只见她消失在浴室里。她叹了口气，走向梳妆台，开始为一天的潜水探险和探索当地珊瑚礁准备行李，这些珊瑚礁正在废墟中生长。随着淋浴声响起，她脱下衣服，换上泳装。他们被告知要随时准备出发，这意味着要穿着得体。她咬着嘴唇，凝视着铺有地毯的地面。

“Earth to Hikari, come in Hikari,” Asuka said, waving a hand in front of her friend’s face.

“光，地球呼叫光，”明日香说着，在她的朋友面前挥了挥手。

“Oh,” squeaked Hikari as she came out of her daze. “I didn’t hear the shower stop.”

“哦，”光从恍惚中回过神来，小声说，“我没听到淋浴停了。”

Asuka stood there, for a few seconds, looking at her friend, puzzled by her behavior. Giving up, she shrugged her shoulders and walked over to the mirror, toweling her hair dry before brushing out the snarls and knots, letting it hang down her back. Styling her hair now would be pointless, as the seawater would soon soak it again. Frowning, she saw that Hikari had not moved from her position, sitting there in her modest blue swimsuit. That caused the redhead to smile, wondering if her friend would ever lose her conservative nature. Dropping her towel, she retrieved her own swimsuit from her dresser, a turquoise bikini.

明日香站在那里，几秒钟内，困惑地看着她的朋友。她放弃了思考，耸了耸肩，走向镜子，用毛巾擦干头发，然后梳理开打结的部分，让头发垂在背后。现在做发型是徒劳的，海水很快又会将其浸湿。她皱起眉头，注意到光仍未离开原地，穿着她那保守的蓝色泳装坐在那里。这让红发女孩微笑起来，好奇她的朋友是否永远都会保持这种保守的天性。她扔掉毛巾，从梳妆台取出自己的泳装，一件碧绿色的比基尼。

“You ready for some diving?” inquired Asuka as she put on her swimsuit, hoping to break the silence.

“准备好去潜水了吗？”明日香边穿泳装边问道，希望能打破沉默。

“Yeah, it should be fun,” replied Hikari before turning red at seeing her friend. “You shouldn’t dress in front of others. And don’t you feel any shame in wearing something so skimpy?”

“嗯，应该挺好玩的，”光回答道，随后看到朋友脸红了。“你不该在别人面前换衣服。穿这么暴露，你不觉得羞耻吗？”

“No, I know I have a great body and so does Shinji.” The redhead grinned. “It’s fun to tease the other boys.”

“不，我知道我身材很好，真嗣也是。”红发少年咧嘴笑道，“逗弄其他男生挺有趣的。”

“Still…” the class representative trailed off. “Are you disappointed that Shinji isn’t going diving with us?”

“不过……”班长欲言又止，“你是不是有点失望，真嗣不和我们一起去潜水？”

“A little. I should’ve taught him to swim. Now he’ll be stuck hiking with the others that aren’t diving,” Asuka replied. “You could say we’ve been inseparable lately.”

“有一点。我本该教他游泳的。现在他只能和其他不会潜水的人一起去徒步了，”飞鸟回答道。“可以说我们最近形影不离。”

“Your relationship is perfect.”

“你们的关系真完美。”

“Not really. We have our fights every now and then but they’re nothing major. After a few days of not talking to each other, we make up.” The redhead explained, pulling on a pair of shorts. Though she didn’t mind showing off at the beach, walking around almost naked was another thing.

“其实不然。我们偶尔会有争执，但都不是什么大事。几天不说话之后，我们就会和好。”红发女子解释道，一边穿上一条短裤。虽然她不介意在海滩上展示自己，但几乎裸着身子四处走动又是另一回事了。

Hikari smiled faintly. “Others would call that perfect. I know I would.”

光微微一笑。“别人可能会称之为完美。我也会这么认为。”

Asuka buttoned up her shorts and pulled on a T-shirt before turning to her friend. “What is the matter with you, Hikari?”

明日香扣好短裤，套上 T 恤，然后转向她的朋友。“光，你怎么了？”

“Nothing.”

“Bullshit! You never act like this unless you have something on your mind.” She saw her friend blush and fidget on the bed. “Okay, spill.”

“胡说八道！你除非心里有事，否则不会这样。”她看到朋友脸红并局促不安地坐在床上。“好吧，说出来吧。”

The brunette didn’t say anything for a few minutes as she gathered her thoughts. She finally looked up and stared into her friend’s eyes. “Has Shinji asked you about sex?”

这位棕发女孩沉默了几分钟，整理思绪。最终她抬起头，直视朋友的眼睛。“真嗣有没有问过你关于性的事？”

“Wha…” Asuka sat down hard on the bed. “What?!”

“什…” 明日香重重地坐在床上。“什么？！”

“You heard me. Has Shinji asked you about sex?” Hikari whispered, not meeting the redhead’s gaze.

“你听到了。真嗣有没有问过你关于性的事？” 光轻声细语，没有直视红发女孩的目光。

“I don’t know what made you suddenly want to discuss that subject, but no he hasn’t brought it up.” She grinned suddenly. “I’ve brought it up, and we’ve talked about it.”

“我不知道是什么让你突然想讨论那个话题，但他确实没有提起过。”她突然咧嘴一笑。“是我提起的，我们已经谈过了。”

“I envy you in that respect,” admitted Hikari. “It’s nice to know that you two can talk about something so serious and keep your relationship together.”

“在这点上我真羡慕你，”Hikari 承认道。“知道你们俩能谈论如此严肃的事情并保持关系和谐，真好。”

Asuka realized where this was going. “It’s better to talk about it early than have it come as a surprise.” She rested her hands on her knees, smiling at her friend. “Now why don’t you tell me what’s bothering you. I really don’t want to play twenty questions.”

明日香意识到事情的走向。“早点谈总比突然来个惊喜好。”她双手放在膝盖上，对朋友微笑着说，“现在告诉我，是什么让你心烦。我真的不想玩二十个问题的游戏。”

Bowing her head, Hikari closed her eyes. “You know about me and Touji, right?”

光低下头，闭上了眼睛。“你知道我和东治的事，对吧？”

“Yeah.”

That story had been one of the first things she had gotten out of Shinji when they had gotten together. She had wanted to know why her friend's relationship had failed and for what reasons. Mainly the redhead wanted to ensure that she didn’t make the same mistakes as her friend. The redhead had drawn many conclusions on why Touji and Hikari’s relationship had failed but she had never expressed them. Now she was in a position where she would have to tell her friend those conclusions.

那个故事是她和真嗣在一起时，她从他那里得知的第一件事。她想知道她朋友的关系为何失败，以及失败的原因。主要是这位红发女孩想要确保自己不会犯同样的错误。她对为什么东治和光的关系会失败做出了许多结论，但她从未表达过。现在，她处于必须向朋友透露这些结论的位置。

“I guess Shinji told you.”

“我猜真嗣已经告诉你了。”

“Yeah, though it’s all third hand information to me.” Asuka got up and sat next to Hikari.

“是啊，虽然对我来说都是些道听途说的消息。” 明日香站起来，坐到了光旁边。

“Why do you think it failed?” Hikari saw her friend shake her head. “Please.”

“你觉得为什么会失败？” 光看到她的朋友摇了摇头。“拜托了。”

“I could say that you were possessive and controlling,” stated Asuka.

“我可以说你很占有欲强且控制欲强，”飞鸟说道。

“And you two aren’t?” the brunette asked. “I’ve seen the way you two act at times.”

“难道你们俩不是吗？”棕发女子问道。“我见过你们俩有时相处的方式。”

“It’s not the same for us, Hikari. Neither of us wants to get hurt again, so we protect what we have, even to the extent of becoming possessive of the other.” The redhead averted her eyes. “Because we just can’t go out and find another person…” She trailed off, not wanting to think about it.

“对于我们来说，光，情况并非如此。我们都不想再次受到伤害，因此我们守护着我们所拥有的，甚至到了对对方产生占有欲的地步。”红发女子移开了目光。“因为我们就是无法走出去，再找另一个人……”她话音渐弱，不愿去想这件事。

Hikari saw the sad look on her friend’s face. “I didn’t know.”

光看到了她朋友脸上的悲伤表情。“我之前不知道。”

“Don’t worry, nobody else understands our relationship.” Asuka looked up smiling. “Anyway back to you and Touji. That’s the reasons I got from Touji’s side. What’s yours?”

“别担心，没人理解我们的关系。”明日香抬头微笑着说。“言归正传，谈谈你和东治吧。这是我从东治那里了解到的理由。你呢？”

“I never knew he thought about it like that,” admitted the brunette. “But that’s not the real reason we broke up. He asked me about…”

“我从不知道他这么想过，”棕发女孩坦白道。“但这不是我们分手的真正原因。他问我关于……”

“Sex.”

“Yeah, I had never felt so shocked in my life.” She had tears in her eyes. “It came out of nowhere and I didn’t know what to do or say.”

“是啊，我这辈子从没这么震惊过。”她眼含泪水。“那完全是突如其来的，我不知所措，也不知道该说什么。”

“Tell me about it.” “说说看。”

Hikari wiped at her nose and stared at the far wall, falling into a monotone. “It was our one-year anniversary, and we had just finished dinner at this fancy restaurant. It served the nicest seafood…” She trailed off at Asuka’s bored expression. “Anyway, instead of calling for a cab, we decided to go for a walk. Over the past year I had gotten him to talk more, and not just about sports. During our conversation Shinji was brought up and then we started talking about you, wondering if you’d wake up. Touji commented on what you’d be like when you woke, whether you’d be the same demon, I’ve always hated that…”

光擦了擦鼻子，盯着远处的墙壁，语气变得单调：“那天是我们的一周年纪念日，我们在一家高档餐厅刚吃完晚餐。那里供应最美味的海鲜……”她看到明日香无聊的表情，话音渐弱。“总之，我们没有叫出租车，而是决定散步。过去一年里，我让他开口说话的次数多了，不只是聊体育。聊天中提到了真嗣，然后我们开始谈论你，想知道你是否会醒来。冬二评论了你醒来后的样子，是否会还是那个我一向讨厌的恶魔……”

“Hikari, hurry up,” interrupted Asuka, frowning.

“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” The girl brushed some hair off her shoulder. “Anyway, I told him you’d have changed, and expected you and Shinji to get together. I’m glad I was right.” She closed her eyes, pausing. “As we approached my house, he stopped me. I thought he was going to kiss me, I was wrong. He asked me where I thought our relationship was headed, if we’d have sex. He kept talking but I wasn’t listening. I pushed him away and ran the rest of the way home.” Hikari was crying as she spoke. “The next day I broke up with him as he tried to explain.”

“是啊，我想你是对的。”女孩拂去肩上的几缕发丝。“不管怎样，我告诉他你已经变了，预料到你和真嗣会走到一起。我很高兴我猜对了。”她闭上眼睛，停顿了一下。“当我们快到我家时，他拦住了我。我以为他要吻我，我错了。他问我，觉得我们的关系会走向何方，是否会有性关系。他一直在说，但我没听进去。我推开他，跑完了剩下的路回家。”说着，光已经泪流满面。“第二天，我跟他分手了，尽管他试图解释。”

“I take it that something’s happening between the two of you?” inquired Asuka.

“我猜你们俩之间是不是发生了什么事？”明日香问道。

“Yes, he sent me flowers on White Day and he wants to get together tonight at the party.” Hikari looked up, scared. “I don’t know what to do.”

“是的，他在白色情人节送了我花，还希望今晚在派对上见面。”光抬头看着，显得很害怕。“我不知道该怎么办。”

“Did you ever ask him to clarify what he meant?”

“你有没有让他澄清他的意思？”

“I know what he meant!” She saw the redhead shake her head.

“我明白他的意思！”她看到红发女子摇了摇头。

“I don’t think you do. You heard that one word and immediately pushed him away without getting an explanation. You have to lighten up,” Asuka stated, frowning. “Your relationship ended because you jumped to conclusions instead of talking it over.”

“我觉得你并没有。你听到那一个词就立刻推开他，没有寻求解释。你得放松点，”明日香皱眉说道。“你的关系之所以结束，是因为你急于下结论，而不是好好谈一谈。”

“So what you’re…” “那么你……”

“What I’m saying is that you should listen to what he has to say.” The pilot stood, sighing. “Though I don’t know what you see in him, neither now nor back then.” She grabbed Hikari’s arms. “Get dressed so we don’t get in trouble.”

“我想说的是，你应该听听他怎么说。”飞行员站起来，叹了口气。“虽然我不明白你为什么看中他，无论是现在还是以前。”她抓住了光的手臂。“快去穿好衣服，免得惹麻烦。”

“Okay.” Hikari stood up, seeing her friend grinning. “What?”

“好的。”光站起身，看到她的朋友正咧嘴笑着。“怎么了？”

“If you think my swimsuit is skimpy you should see what he got me back in March,” the redhead commented. “My nightgown barely crosses my hips and I swear you can see through it.”

“如果你觉得我的泳装太暴露，那你应该看看他三月份给我买的。”红发女子评论道，“我的睡裙几乎遮不住臀部，我发誓都能透视了。”

“Asuka!”

- - - -

“Oh man, this is too much,” moaned Touji, leaning against the wall of the diving store. “Nothing compares to seeing this.”

“哎呀，这太过了，”东二靠在潜水用品店的墙上哀叹道，“亲眼所见，无与伦比。”

The boys of the class that had either put their wetsuits on or weren’t going diving stood in the shade. Their attention was fully on the girls that were pulling on the tight rubber suits after soaking themselves. The different styles of suits were not what attracted the attention of the males but what they hid.

班上的男生们，要么已经穿上了潜水服，要么不打算潜水，都站在阴凉处。他们的目光完全集中在那些正在穿上紧身橡胶潜水服的女生身上，她们之前还特意把自己弄湿。吸引男生们注意的并非潜水服的不同款式，而是它们所遮掩的部分。

“I’ve never seen so many great examples of breasts and legs,” commented Ryo, his eyes wandering over one female that had her back to him, bent over pulling her suit on.

“我从未见过这么多出色的胸部和腿部示例，”Ryo 评论道，他的目光游移在一位背对着他、弯腰穿泳衣的女性身上。

“Isn’t Maki your girlfriend?”

“Maki 不是你的女朋友吗？”

All eyes turned to Shinji who was looking out over the ocean, ignoring the girls. The upper half of his wetsuit hung freely, ready to be put on once they were ready to dive. It was hot enough without having to be encased in black rubber, which was evident by the sweat running down his back. He looked back at the scene behind him, glad that he had taken Asuka’s advice in getting a tan before going on the trip. A few of the girls and guys were going to be feeling the affects of sunburn later in the day. The young man turned back to the sea, waiting for an answer.

所有目光转向了凝视着大海的碇真嗣，他无视了周围的女孩们。他身上的潜水服上半部分随意地挂着，只待他们准备好潜水时再穿上。在炎热的天气里，没有必要被黑色橡胶包裹，这一点从他背上流淌的汗水就能看出。他回头望向身后的场景，庆幸自己采纳了明日香的建议，在旅行前先晒了个日光浴。当天晚些时候，一些男孩和女孩将会感受到晒伤的影响。年轻人再次转向大海，等待着答案。

Ryo shrugged his shoulders. “Of course she is. But who could resist all that?” he asked, sweeping his arm out. “It’s just too much.”

绫小路耸了耸肩。“她当然是。但谁能抗拒这一切呢？”他问道，手臂一挥。“这实在是太多了。”

“I wish you had brought a camera, Kensuke,” muttered Touji.

“我真希望你带了相机，健介，”冬二嘟囔道。

“Who says I didn’t?” replied the information gatherer, pointing to his sunglasses. “I’ll have them ready after we get back.”

“谁说我没带？”情报收集者回答道，指了指他的太阳镜。“我们回去后我就把它们准备好。”

Shinji sighed, disgusted. “You know voyeurism is against the law.”

真嗣厌恶地叹了口气，“你知道偷窥是违法的。”

“Only if you…” “只有当你…”

Shinji turned when Kensuke’s voice died, hearing someone approaching quickly. A mess of auburn hair and a scowl greeted him as his girlfriend strode across the beach. The young man tried to back away but realized too late there was a railing. The feeling of everyone watching them was strong as Asuka stopped in front of him.

真嗣在听到急促的脚步声时转过身，因为剑介的声音已经消失。他的女友大步穿过海滩，一头乱糟糟的赤褐色头发和紧皱的眉头迎接着他。年轻人试图后退，但意识到太晚，身后有一道栏杆。当明日香停在他面前时，那种被所有人注视的感觉异常强烈。

“Hello Asuka,” he said cordially.

“你好，明日香。”他客气地说道。

“Hello partner,” she growled, smiling dangerously. “Unless of course you have someone else in mind. I mean you did forget to tell you could swim.”

“你好，伙伴，”她低吼道，危险地笑着。“除非你心里还有其他人选。我是说，你忘了告诉我你会游泳。”

“I guess it slipped my mind,” he replied nervously as she got closer. “And I’ll gladly be your partner.”

“我想是我忘了，”他紧张地回答，而她越走越近。“我很乐意成为你的伙伴。”

“Good, and I guess I can forgive you this time but you’re going to have to do something for me.” Her smile turned playful suddenly. “After all you do have your uses.”

“好吧，我想这次我可以原谅你，但你必须为我做点什么。”她的笑容突然变得俏皮起来。“毕竟你还是有些用处的。”

“Miss Soryu, if you don’t mind, could you hurry up and change we’re on a schedule,” their teacher interrupted.

“早乙女小姐，如果您不介意的话，能否快点换衣服？我们时间紧迫。”他们的老师打断道。

“Sorry sir!”

She spun around and strode away, dragging Shinji behind her. The redhead ignored the laughter that followed her as she went over to the outdoor showers. Stripping down to her bathing suit, she stuffed her clothes in her duffel bag before stepping under the water. Arching her back, she thrust her chest out for the young man. She laughed at the boy’s reaction as she pulled on her wetsuit. Looking up she stopped at the expression he was giving her.

她转身大步离开，拖着真嗣跟在后面。红发女孩对身后的笑声置若罔闻，径直走向户外淋浴区。脱到只剩泳装，她将衣物塞进运动包，然后站到水下。她挺直背脊，向前挺胸，对那少年展露笑颜。看着他那副表情，她在穿上潜水服时忍不住笑出声来。抬头一看，她停下了动作，凝视着他此刻的表情。

“What?”

“I can’t believe you wore that out here.” His voice was low, almost angry.

“我真不敢相信你在这里穿成这样。”他的声音低沉，几乎带着怒气。

“Are you trying to tell me what to do or wear?” she asked, harshly. “You don’t own…”

“你是想告诉我该做什么或穿什么吗？”她严厉地问道，“你并不拥有……”

“It’s not like that!” the boy hissed. “Do you like being treated like a piece of meat? Kensuke probably has a dozen pictures already.”

“不是那样的！”男孩低声说，“你喜欢被当作一块肉对待吗？健介可能已经有十几张照片了。”

“What are you talking…” She trailed off, her face red. Turning around she saw the boys staring at her with hungry eyes. “I suggest you find something else to look at!!” She yelled.

“你在说什么…”她话没说完，脸就红了。转过身，她看到那些男孩正用饥渴的眼神盯着她。“我建议你们找点别的看！！”她吼道。

Shinji watched as they turned around. “That’s not going to stop them. That suit…” He tried to turn away from a wet Asuka but she stopped him with a touch. Her bikini showed off more cleavage then he normally saw. “They’re going to see that as an invitation.”

真嗣看着他们转身。“那不会阻止他们的。那套衣服……”他试图避开湿漉漉的明日香，但她用手阻止了他。她的比基尼比他平时看到的更显胸。“他们会把那看作是邀请。”

“They better not or they’ll find themselves in the hospital,” Asuka said, watching in amusement as Shinji looked her over. “I only want one person.” She traced her fingers over his chest, feeling the muscle tremble and the sweat that covered him. “And that’s you.”

“他们最好别这样，否则他们会发现自己进了医院，”明日香说，看着真嗣打量她，感到有趣。“我只想一个人。”她用手指划过他的胸膛，感觉到肌肉的颤抖和覆盖他的汗水。“那就是你。”

“Let’s hurry before they start without us.”

“我们快点，别让他们不等我们就开始了。”

- - - - A flash of movement caught Shinji’s eye and he slowly turned, his eyes darting around. He inhaled quickly when he saw the sleek shapes of four sharks as they darted around the ruins. Moving his hand down to his thigh, he felt the weapon strapped to his leg. Keeping his eyes on the sharks, he moved to where he had last seen Asuka, only to find her gone from the building he left her at. He screamed into the air regulator as something wrapped around his torso. Streams of red floated around his head and he relaxed. Floating next to Asuka, he grabbed a square plastic sheet.

一道闪动的影子吸引了真嗣的注意，他缓缓转身，目光四处扫视。当他看到四条鲨鱼在废墟间穿梭的流线型身影时，他倒吸了一口凉气。他把手伸向大腿，摸到了绑在腿上的武器。他紧盯着鲨鱼，朝最后一次见到明日香的地方移动，却发现她已不在他留她的那栋建筑里。当有什么东西缠绕住他的腰时，他对着空气调节器尖叫起来。一缕缕红色在他头部周围漂浮，他放松下来。漂浮在明日香旁边，他抓起一块方形塑料板。

“You think that was funny?” he wrote on his dive board.

“你觉得那很有趣吗？”他在跳水板上写道。

“Of course it was, idiot,” she replied, a grin on her face. “I’ve got something to show you.”

“当然有趣，傻瓜，”她回答道，脸上带着笑容。“我有东西要给你看。”

“What is it?” “这是什么？”

But she didn’t reply, instead pushing off of him and kicking furiously. He glanced at his depth gauge as they passed 120 feet, heading for the street below. The teachers had been stern in telling everyone not to go below 100 feet, yet Shinji didn’t stop. With a few quick kicks, he was beside the redhead, staring at the weird scene around him. No vehicles of any sort were on the street while empty windows beckoned for them to explore. As they exited the street, he stopped in surprise as Asuka grabbed his arm. The park was surreal with damaged benches and shattered fountains surrounded by the remains of trees.

但她没有回答，反而推开他，拼命踢水。他们经过 120 英尺，向街道下方游去时，他瞥了一眼深度计。老师们曾严厉告诫大家不要下潜超过 100 英尺，但真嗣没有停下。几下快速踢水后，他来到红发女孩旁边，凝视着周围奇异的景象。街道上没有任何车辆，空荡荡的窗户仿佛在召唤他们去探索。当他们离开街道时，他惊讶地停下，因为明日香抓住了他的手臂。公园里一片超现实景象，破损的长椅和碎裂的喷泉被树木残骸环绕。

He had been caught up in the view that he hadn’t noticed the girl press against him. She was pointing upward with one arm. Nodding his head, the boy looked up and his breath caught in his throat. Even with the clear water, the sunlight barely made it to that depth but that wasn’t what captivated him. Swirling above their heads were a dozen sharks, darting about as they fed. He felt his heart race as Asuka drifted upward motioning for him to follow. With hiss of compressed air, he increased his buoyancy, following closely after the girl. They drifted upwards until they had reached the edge of the pack. Shinji watched horrified as Asuka stretched a hand out as a shark came close to them. He could swear his heart stopped for a moment when her hand slid along its belly before it swam off, its muscles rippling. Drifting motionless, he was surprised when she got behind him and grabbed his arm. Though he was stronger he let her guide his hand onto the side of one of the fish as it passed. Even through the wetsuit he could feel the sandpaper texture of its skin, and the pulsing muscles as it swam by.

他沉醉于眼前的景象，未曾察觉女孩已悄然贴近。她单臂指向高处，男孩点头仰望，呼吸为之一滞。即便水质清澈，阳光也难以穿透至这般深度，然而令他着迷的并非此景。头顶上方，十数条鲨鱼盘旋觅食，穿梭游弋。心跳加速间，明日香向上漂浮，示意他跟随。随着压缩空气的嘶鸣，他调整浮力紧随其后。两人缓缓上升，直至接近鲨群边缘。真嗣惊恐地目睹明日香伸出手，当一条鲨鱼靠近时。他确信那一刻心脏停跳，当她的手滑过鲨鱼腹部，后者才悠然游离，肌肉波动。静止漂浮中，他惊讶地感到她绕至身后，抓住他的手臂。尽管力气更大，他仍任由她引导自己的手触碰经过的鲨鱼侧身。即便隔着潜水服，他仍能感受到那砂纸般的皮肤质感，以及鲨鱼游动时肌肉的脉动。

- - - -

“I can’t believe they yelled at us like that,” complained Asuka. “We got the most specimens and completed our work in record time.”

“我真不敢相信他们那样对我们大喊大叫，”明日香抱怨道，“我们采集了最多的样本，并且以创纪录的速度完成了工作。”

Shinji tightened his hold on the girl as they sat on a beach blanket watching the moonrise. The crackle of bonfires and laughter came from further down the beach. He tried to ignore the smell of food as it drifted on the wind. As soon as the party had started they had left everyone and moved away to be alone. He had not protested, knowing she would explain but as time passed she had remained silent, only wrapping his arms around her, as it grew colder.

真嗣紧紧抱住女孩，两人坐在沙滩毯上观赏着月升。远处篝火的噼啪声和欢笑声传来。他试图忽略随风飘来的食物香味。派对一开始，他们就离开了所有人，移到一旁独处。他没有抗议，知道她会解释，但随着时间流逝，她一直保持沉默，只是用他的手臂环绕着自己，因为天气越来越冷。

“They didn’t do it on purpose,” he said diplomatically. “We went below the depth that they had set. Not to mention the scene with the sharks.”

“他们并非有意为之，”他圆滑地说道，“我们潜到了他们设定的深度以下。更别提遭遇鲨鱼的场面了。”

“That’s crap and you know it!” she snapped. “We’re both certified divers.” She threw up her arms. “They’re treating us like children and they have no right to!”

“你明知道这是胡说八道！”她厉声反驳。“我们俩都是持证潜水员。”她挥舞着双臂。“他们把我们当小孩对待，根本没有这个权利！”

“We are children to them,” he said quietly.

“在他们眼里，我们只是孩子，”他轻声说道。

She turned in his arms. “You don’t actually believe that do you, after everything we’ve done and gone through.” Her scowl deepened. “And you’re eighteen, an adult.”

她在他怀里转过身来，“你不会真的相信那套说辞吧，毕竟我们经历了那么多。”她的眉头皱得更深了，“况且你已经十八岁，是个成年人了。”

“No, I just think some of them are scared of us,” Shinji stated. “I can see it in their eyes, we’re too mature for them. We’re not like others who listen to authority blindly or don’t question their elders. “We’re too…”

“不，我只是觉得他们中有些人害怕我们，”真嗣说道，“我能从他们的眼神中看出来，我们太成熟了，对他们来说。我们不像那些盲目听从权威或不质疑长辈的人。我们太……”

“Independent,” finished Asuka, seeing him nod. “Still it doesn’t give them a right to dominate us.” Shinji laughed at that. “What?”

“独立，”明日香接过话头，看到他点头。“即便如此，这也不意味着他们有权支配我们。”真嗣对此笑了。“怎么了？”

The boy continued to laugh until she dug her nails into his arms. “Just the image that popped into my head. I don’t see anyone dominating you.”

男孩继续笑着，直到她将指甲深深嵌入他的手臂。“只是突然想到的画面。我看不出有人能支配你。”

“You sick pervert. Get your mind out of the gutter.” Despite her words she felt her face heat up. “I don’t like leather.”

“你这个变态，快把你的思想从阴沟里拉出来。”尽管她这么说，却感到自己的脸颊发烫。“我不喜欢皮革。”

“Can we go get something to eat? I’m starving,” he pleaded.

“我们能去吃点东西吗？我饿坏了，”他恳求道。

“No! This is our protest against being treated unfairly. Besides what’s a little hunger?” At that moment her stomach growled.

“不行！这是我们对不公平待遇的抗议。再说，饿一点又算什么？”就在那时，她的肚子咕噜咕噜叫了起来。

“Sounds like I’m not the only hungry one.”

“听起来我不是唯一一个饿的人。”

Both stood and grabbed their shoes before walking down the beach. The pilots ignored the whispers and looks from the other students when they walked into the light, striding to the tables of food. Neither said a word, splitting up to get what they needed before leaving again. Shinji walked toward the beverages while Asuka went to grab a couple plates from the main table. As she stood in line she heard someone come up behind her, standing real close. The redhead didn’t think of anything of it until the person grabbed her leg.

两人起身抓起鞋子，沿着海滩走去。飞行员们走进灯光下，无视其他学生的窃窃私语和目光，大步走向食物桌。他们一言不发，各自分散去取所需，然后再次离开。真嗣走向饮料区，而明日香则去主桌拿了几盘食物。排队时，她感觉到有人紧跟在她身后。起初红发少女并未在意，直到那人抓住了她的腿。

“If you’re not Shinji, I suggest you remove your hand. Fast,” she growled.

“如果你不是真嗣，我建议你快把手拿开，”她低吼道。

“Come on, Soryu. With what you’re wearing, you’re just begging for someone to rescue you from that wimp,” the boy said.

“来吧，索龙。你穿成这样，简直就是在求人把你从那个懦夫手里救出来，”男孩说。

She turned around, frowning and eyes narrowed. “And who are you?”

她转过身来，皱着眉头，眼睛眯成一条缝。“你是谁？”

The boy, who was shorter than her, smiled. “Yuu Nakao.”

那个比她矮的男孩微笑着说：“中尾优。”

“Nakao, huh.” Asuka grinned at him. “Wasn’t my wimpy boyfriend the one that put you in the hospital a while back?”

“中尾，是吧。”明日香朝他咧嘴一笑。“之前不就是我那没用的男朋友把你送进医院的吗？”

“Umm…you see,” Yuu stuttered trying to back away.

“呃……这个，”悠结结巴巴地试图后退。

“Not so fast, asshole.” She twisted his arm making him cry out. “I said this before but I don’t think everyone got the message.” She raised her voice. “Listen up everyone! I hate repeating myself so this is the last time! I’m not interested in any one of you! If you so much as touch me, I’ll break your fucking arm! If you make a lewd comment you’ll wish you were a priest!”

“别那么快，混蛋。”她扭住他的胳膊，让他痛得叫出声来。“我之前说过，但我觉得不是所有人都听明白了。”她提高嗓门，“大家都听好了！我讨厌重复自己，所以这是最后一次！我对你们中的任何一个都没兴趣！如果你们敢碰我，我会折断你们的胳膊！要是敢说下流话，你们会宁愿自己是神父！”

With that she twisted Yuu’s arm before shoving him away, where he fell to the ground. Whirling around, she grabbed two plates from a stunned server’s hands. She waited until a Shinji came up to her with the drinks before they walked away. They both sat down on the blanket and started eating in silence. Shinji was too shocked to say anything and Asuka too pissed to want to talk. Both quickly finished the food and sat there drinking, watching the waves come and go.

说完，她扭了扭悠的胳膊，然后把他推开，他摔倒在地。她转身从一位惊呆的服务员手中夺过两个盘子。她等到真嗣拿着饮料走过来，然后两人一起离开。他们一起坐在毯子上，默默地开始吃饭。真嗣震惊得说不出话，明日香也气得不想交谈。两人迅速吃完食物，坐在那里喝着饮料，看着海浪来来去去。

“You know,” Shinji ventured. “I heard an interesting fact yesterday.”

“你知道，”真嗣试探着说，“我昨天听到一个有趣的事实。”

“And what was that?” Asuka had a small smile. “I never knew you were into gossip.”

“那是什么呢？”明日香带着一丝微笑，“我还真不知道你对八卦感兴趣。”

“It’s not gossip,” he replied. “I got it straight from Omi Suzuki, my roommate for the trip.”

“这不是闲话，”他回答道，“我是直接从大三铃木那里听来的，他是我这次旅行的室友。”

“So what is it?” “那到底是什么事？”

“Miyu’s pregnant,” he told her.

“Oh God,” Asuka laughed. “She got what she deserved for sleeping around.”

“哦，天哪，” 明日香笑道，“她到处睡觉，这是她应得的报应。”

“Asuka! It’s not funny.” The boy glared at her until she stopped.

“明日香！这不好笑。” 男孩瞪着她，直到她停止笑声。

The redhead sat there quietly, looking at Shinji. Pulling her legs up, she wrapped her arms around them and stared out to sea, worried. Sure he was normally serious about a lot of things but he rarely snapped at her. Asuka knew that she had told Hikari that they had had their fights, but she didn’t mention that the majority of them were her fault. She didn’t want to get into a fight with Shinji over something so minor as another girl getting pregnant. After all, it wasn’t her so why should she care?

红发的女孩静静地坐在那里，望着真嗣。她把腿蜷起来，双臂环抱住它们，忧心忡忡地望向大海。她知道，虽然他平时对很多事情都很认真，但很少对她发火。明日香知道她曾告诉过光她们有过争吵，但她没有提及大部分争吵都是她的错。她不想因为另一个女孩怀孕这样的小事和真嗣吵架。毕竟，又不是她怀孕，她为什么要在意呢？

“I’m sorry.” He watched Asuka jump at his quiet words. “It’s just that…”

“对不起。”他轻声说道，看着明日香被他的话吓了一跳。“只是……”

The girl scooted closer and put an arm around his shoulder. “Why are you being so serious, Shinji? All she has to do is get an abortion.”

女孩挪近了些，伸手搭在他的肩上。“你为什么这么严肃，真嗣？她只需要去做个流产就行了。”

“No, she can’t.” He sighed when she looked at him. “Miyu’s father found out and is forcing her to have it.”

“不，她不能。”他叹了口气，当她看向他时。“美里的父亲知道了，正逼她生下来。”

“Ouch!”

“Not only that but she has to marry the father or she’ll be disowned.”

“不仅如此，她还得嫁给孩子的父亲，否则就会被逐出家门。”

Asuka’s eyes widened in shock. “Wait a minute! How did Omi know so much about what’s happening?” She saw Shinji staring at her. “Don’t tell me…”

明日香的眼睛因震惊而睁大。“等一下！小美怎么会对发生的事情知道得这么多？”她看到真嗣正盯着她。“别告诉我……”

The boy nodded. 男孩点了点头。

“He was such a nice boy. And now he has to marry that…” She stopped puzzled. “Wait! How’d they know he was the father and how are they forcing him to marry her?”

“他是个多么好的男孩啊。现在他却不得不娶那个……”她困惑地停了下来。“等等！他们怎么知道他是父亲，又是如何强迫他娶她的？”

“Omi’s been dating Miyu for the last four months. As for why he’s being forced to marry her, Miyu’s father called his parents and from what I heard they worked out the plans.”

“Omi 与 Miyu 交往已四月有余。至于他为何被迫与她结婚，据我所知，Miyu 的父亲联系了他的父母，双方已商定计划。”

“Oh…”

The redhead trailed off, trying to comprehend what she had just been told. Being forced to marry someone because you slept with him and got pregnant didn’t result in a loving marriage. Asuka tried to envision what it would be like if that happened to her, but could only realize that her life would be miserable. She wanted to marry someone because she loved him and wanted him to be a part of her life. Looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw Shinji staring blankly at the water.

红发女子话音渐弱，试图理解刚刚被告知的一切。因与某人共寝而怀孕被迫结婚，这样的婚姻难有真爱。Asuka 试图想象若此事发生在自己身上会是何种境遇，却只能意识到生活将变得悲惨。她渴望因爱而嫁，希望对方成为自己生命的一部分。她用眼角余光瞥见 Shinji 正呆望着水面。

“Why’d you tell me that?” she asked. “It’s not like I really needed to know.”

“你为什么告诉我这个？”她问道。“我又不是真的需要知道。”

“Don’t know. I just thought you’d like to hear about it since you don’t like Miyu,” the boy admitted.

“不知道。我只是觉得你会想听，因为你不喜欢美雪，”男孩承认道。

“That’s not the only reason,” she told him, wanting to get to the real issue.

“那不是唯一的原因，”她告诉他，想要触及真正的问题。

“Yes it was.” “是的，确实如此。”

Asuka rolled onto the boy, forcing him to his back. Leaning forward, she stared into his eyes. “You’re a poor liar.”

明日香翻身压在男孩身上，迫使他仰面躺下。她俯身向前，直视他的眼睛。“你真是个蹩脚的说谎者。”

Shinji swallowed, looking down her partially unbuttoned shirt instead of meeting her eyes. “Fine.”

真嗣咽了口唾沫，目光落在她半解的衬衫上，而不是与她对视。“好吧。”

The redhead saw where he was looking, hitting him lightly. “Come on, idiot.”

红发人看到他在看哪里，轻轻地打了他一下。“快点，傻瓜。”

“Have you ever thought of having children?” he asked, quietly.

“你有没有想过要孩子？”他轻声问道。

Asuka rolled off of him and onto her back, staring up at the stars. She was aware of Shinji propping himself up on one elbow and staring at her but she ignored him. Of everything they had talked about in the last year since getting together, two subjects had never been discussed: children and marriage. Marriage because they had only started dating and talking about something like that was for the future. She suspected that they’d never talked about children because it would involve marriage, there was no way Shinji would allow her to be a single mother.

明日香从他身上滚落，仰面躺下，凝望着星空。她察觉到真嗣用一只胳膊肘撑起身体，正盯着她看，但她选择无视。自从他们在一起的这一年里，谈及过无数话题，唯独两个从未触及：孩子与婚姻。婚姻未被提及，是因为他们才刚开始交往，讨论这类事似乎还为时尚早。她猜想，关于孩子的议题之所以被搁置，或许是因为它牵扯到婚姻，真嗣绝不会允许她成为单亲妈妈。

“Have you?” he repeated when she remained silent.

“你呢？”他重复道，而她依旧沉默。

“Not really,” she said, folding her arms under her head. “I don’t think I’d make a good mother with my past. I’m not ready for the responsibility of raising a child.”

“其实没有，”她说着，将双臂枕在头下。“考虑到我的过去，我不认为自己能成为一个好母亲。我还未准备好承担养育孩子的责任。”

“You handled the responsibility of fighting the Angels,” he told her, resting a hand on her shoulder.

“你承担了对抗天使的责任，”他告诉她，一只手搭在她的肩上。

“Fighting the Angels and raising a child are two different things, Shinji.” She sat up. “If we lost during the Angels, there wouldn’t have been anyone around to criticize us. We screw up with a child and it will follow us around for the rest of our lives. Not to mention everyone second guessing us.”

“与天使战斗和抚养孩子是两码事，真嗣。”她坐起身来。“如果我们输给了天使，那时不会有人来指责我们。但我们在抚养孩子上出了差错，这将会伴随我们一生。更不用说周围人的质疑了。”

“So you never want to have children?”

“所以你永远不想要孩子吗？”

She lifted her head. “I never said that. It’s just at the moment I’m not ready. Maybe sometime in the future that’ll change.” The girl smiled. “We haven’t even done it yet and you’re thinking of the next stage.”

她抬起头说：“我从没说过那样的话。只是现在我还未准备好。或许将来某一天会有所改变。”女孩微笑着说：“我们还没开始呢，你已经在考虑下一步了。”

“I know…” He stopped as she stood up and offered him her hand. He found himself pulled into a hug when he reached his feet. "Asuka?"

“我知道…”他话音未落，她便站起身来，向他伸出手。当他站起来时，发现自己被拉入了一个拥抱。"明日香？"

“You think the teachers would mind if we went skinny dipping?” She felt him tense up. “Just think of it. You, me, no clothes and the warm water.”

“你觉得老师们会在意我们裸泳吗？”她感觉到他紧张起来。“想象一下，你和我，一丝不挂，还有温暖的水。”

“Asuka!”

She tightened her hold. “I was just joking.”

她抱得更紧了。“我只是开玩笑。”

“Than what were you trying to say?”

“那你想表达的是什么呢？”

“What I’m saying is that we should enjoy ourselves for now.” She gave him a kiss on the neck. “I want to enjoy what’s left of my teenage years. I don’t want to think of responsibilities, commitments, jobs or anything else in the adult world.” Asuka stopped in front of him. “You understand what I’m saying?”

“我想说的是，我们现在应该尽情享受。”她在他的脖子上亲了一下。“我想享受剩下的青春时光。我不想考虑责任、承诺、工作或成人世界的任何其他事情。”明日香停在他面前。“你明白我的意思吗？”

“Yeah.” He took her hand in his and walked back to the bonfire. “Enjoy life now because it’ll be over before you know it.”

“是的。”他握住她的手，一起走回篝火旁。“享受现在的生活吧，因为转眼间它就会结束。”

“Close enough.” “差不多。”

November 2019

Shinji ignored the burning sensations in his legs and chest, pushing himself harder. The finish line of the indoor track came into view, as well as Kensuke standing next to it, holding a stopwatch. The pilot could hear Touji behind him but knew there was no way his friend, with his prosthetic leg, would catch up to him. With a final burst of speed, he crossed the line hearing the click of the watch being stopped. He slowed down to walk, waiting for Touji to catch up to him so they could do their warm down laps. Two pairs of footsteps made him turn his head to see both his friends coming up to him.

真嗣无视腿上和胸口的灼热感，更加用力地奔跑。室内跑道的终点线映入眼帘，健介站在旁边，手里拿着秒表。真嗣能听到身后东治的声音，但他知道，装着假肢的朋友不可能追上他。随着最后一股劲的爆发，他冲过终点线，听到了秒表被按停的咔哒声。他放慢速度开始走动，等待东治追上来，以便一起做放松跑。两对脚步声让他转过头，看到两位朋友正向他走来。

“Good time, Shinji. You took ten seconds off your best record,” commented Kensuke, holding out a towel.

“不错的时间，真嗣。你比最好成绩快了十秒，”健介递过一条毛巾评论道。

Shinji accepted it and smiled at the news but didn’t say anything as he was still winded. He saw the scowl on Touji’s face when he heard that he had made no progress on his time. Even with the advanced technology built into Touji’s leg he couldn’t maintain a long distance pace. The pilot wiped the sweat from his face before draping a towel around his neck. The banter continued between the friends as they talked about various things from school to money to girls. Well Touji and Kensuke talked about girls with Shinji joining in once in a while with a comment.

真嗣接受了消息，微笑着，但并未言语，因为他仍喘息未定。他注意到当听说自己时间上没有进展时，东治脸上的怒容。尽管东治的腿植入了先进技术，他仍无法保持长距离的步伐。飞行员擦去脸上的汗水，然后将毛巾搭在脖子上。朋友们之间的玩笑继续着，他们谈论着从学校到金钱再到女孩的各种话题。东治和健介谈论女孩时，真嗣偶尔也会插上一两句。

“So where’s the old ball and chain, Shinji?” asked Touji as they sat on the workout mats, stretching.

“那么，老伙计，真嗣，你的另一半在哪里呢？”东治边伸展边坐在健身垫上问道。

“She’s not a ball and chain,” he replied darkly.

“她又不是枷锁，”他阴沉地回答。

“Oh come on. You two are joined at the hip. I’ve never seen a worse case of love before,” Kensuke joined in. “You guys are so sappy at times, it’s disgusting.”

“得了吧。你们俩简直是形影不离。我从未见过比这更严重的恋爱症状，”健介插话说，“你们有时候腻歪得让人恶心。”

Shinji shook his head. “We are not sappy at school or in public and you know it.” He glared at his friend. “And besides I like being around her, she’s nice. We do a lot of fun things together.”

真嗣摇了摇头。“我们在学校或公共场合并不腻歪，你知道的。”他瞪了朋友一眼。“而且我喜欢和她在一起，她人很好。我们在一起做了很多有趣的事情。”

“Nice! She punched me on the school trip,” exclaimed Kensuke.

“太棒了！她在学校旅行时给了我一拳，”健介惊叹道。

“Maybe if you had given her the pictures you had taken of her, you wouldn’t have been hit.”

“或许如果你把拍她的照片给她，你就不会被打。”

“Oh man! I can’t believe you’re defending her!” Kensuke looked over at Touji. “Some help, please.”

“哦，天哪！我真不敢相信你竟然在为她辩护！” 健介看着冬二说，“帮帮忙吧。”

The boy shrugged his shoulders. “You got yourself into this mess, get yourself out of it.” He leaned back against a wall. “I just barely understand her but it’s enough to keep us from fighting.” His eyes shifted to look at Shinji. “Besides you love her, so I won’t provoke her. You do love her, don’t you?”

男孩耸了耸肩，“你自己惹的麻烦，自己解决吧。”他靠在墙上，“我虽然不太懂她，但足以让我们不至于争吵。”他的目光转向真嗣，“再说你爱她，所以我不会去招惹她。你是爱她的，对吧？”

“Of course I do, but…” He couldn’t finish his statement, scared of what he would say.

“我当然爱她，但是……”他没能说完，害怕自己会说出什么。

“Has she told you?” “她告诉你了吗？”

“No, not outright,” was the quiet admission. “And that’s what scares me. Like she’ll never be able to say those words to me. That she’ll keep a part of herself from me, never loving me fully.”

“不，没有明说，”是那低沉的承认。“而这正是让我害怕的。好像她永远无法对我说出那些话。她会对我保留一部分自己，永远不会全心全意地爱我。”

Touji sat there silently for a few seconds. “I wouldn’t worry. If she didn’t love you, she wouldn’t have stayed with you this long.”

冬二静静地坐在那里几秒钟。“我不担心。如果她不爱你，她不会和你在一起这么久。”

“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”

“嗯，我想你是对的。”

“So don’t think about it at the moment, instead worry about the dance tonight…hey!” Kensuke got both wet towels in the face at his comment, pulling them off with a disgusted look. “What’d I say?”

“所以现在别想这事了，还是担心今晚的舞会吧……嘿！” 听到这话，健介脸上被扔了两块湿毛巾，他一脸厌恶地扯下来，问道：“我说错什么了？”

“Nobody was supposed to mention the dance. Remember our agreement?” growled Touji. “That’s why we’re here, to keep our minds off of it. I just wish we had some time for more weightlifting.”

“本来就不该提舞会的事。记得我们的约定吗？” 冬二低吼道，“我们之所以在这里，就是为了不去想它。真希望我们能有更多时间来举重。”

“Or swimming,” Shinji commented, but was ignored as Kensuke zeroed in on Touji.

“或者游泳，”真嗣评论道，但被无视了，因为健介将注意力集中在了东治身上。

“So you’re going tonight?” asked Kensuke, seeing his friend nod. “With Hikari.” This time the young man’s face grew bright red. “So I wonder which one of you is going to have fun tonight.”

“那你今晚去吗？”健介问道，看到他的朋友点头。“和光一起。”这次，年轻人的脸变得通红。“所以我想知道你们俩今晚谁会更开心。”

Touji shook his head. “I’m not going to do anything stupid tonight. If Asuka and Shinji can get together, then I better try again with Hikari.”

冬二摇了摇头。“今晚我不会做任何蠢事。如果明日香和真嗣能在一起，那我最好再试试和光子。”

“What about you?” The question was directed at the quiet boy.

“你呢？”这个问题是向那个安静的男孩提出的。

Shinji shook his head. “Nothing’s going to happen tonight. We promised each other we’d wait.” He looked up in shock, realizing what he had said. His friends’ eyes were wide. “Forget what I just said.”

真嗣摇了摇头。“今晚什么都不会发生。我们答应过彼此要等待。”他震惊地抬头，意识到自己说了什么。他的朋友们眼睛瞪得大大的。“忘了我刚才说的话吧。”

Kensuke grinned, shaking his head. “Oh no, Ikari, we’re not going to forget it. It sounded like you and Asuka are planning to…”

健介咧嘴一笑，摇了摇头。“哦不，碇，我们不会忘记的。听起来你和明日香打算……”

Shinji stood up, grabbing hold of his friend, putting him in a headlock. “It’s none of your business what Asuka and I do in the future.” He smiled faintly, knowing that he wasn’t hurting Kensuke. “Besides who’s the one not going to the dance?”

真嗣站起身来，抓住他的朋友，给他来了个锁头。“我和明日香将来做什么，与你无关。”他微微一笑，知道自己并没有弄疼健介。“再说了，谁才是那个不去舞会的人？”

“Okay, okay I understand. Now can you let me go?” Kensuke didn’t enjoy being twisted. He jumped out of arm’s reach when he was released. “So what’s her best feature.”

“好吧，好吧，我明白了。现在能放开我了吗？”健介不喜欢被扭着。一被放开，他就跳出了手臂可及的范围。“那她最吸引人的特点是什么？”

“Kensuke,” growled Shinji, but looked down when Touji caught his arm.

“谦介，”真嗣低吼道，但当东治抓住他的手臂时，他低下了头。

“Just humor him.”

Shinji smiled both at the comment and what he was about to say. “Her best feature is…”

真嗣对这番评论以及他即将说出的话都笑了笑。“她最出色的特点是……”

“What?” They leaned forward in anticipation.

“什么？”他们向前倾身，满怀期待。

“Her face.”

- - - -

Shinji slid his card through the reader, smiling faintly as the memory of his friends’ reactions to his admission. Even after all the years of asking him that question, they still had been expecting him to admit to liking her breasts or butt, not her face. While he did like those parts of her, he didn’t get to see them that often. Even when they slept together she made sure that she was covered as much as possible. Glancing down, he saw a new pair of shoes as he kicked his own off.

真嗣将卡片滑过读卡器，回想起朋友们对他被录取的反应，不禁微微一笑。尽管多年来他们一直问他那个问题，他们仍然期待他会承认喜欢她的胸部或臀部，而不是她的脸。虽然他的确喜欢她那些部位，但他并不经常看到。即使他们同床共枕，她也总是确保自己尽可能地遮盖好。他低头一看，发现了一双新鞋，便将自己的鞋子踢掉。

Walking into the apartment, he groaned at the mess in the living room, knowing that he would be expected to pick it up. Instead, he kicked the boxes out of the way and sat down on the couch, flipping through the channels. He knew he was early in returning from the gym, but also knew that no matter how much time Asuka was given she always required more. The boy turned his head slightly as a door opened and closed down the hall.

走进公寓，他对着客厅的凌乱叹了口气，知道自己得收拾。然而，他只是把箱子踢到一边，坐在沙发上，翻看着电视频道。他知道自己从健身房回来得早，但也清楚，无论给明日香多少时间，她总是需要更多。男孩微微转头，听到走廊里一扇门开了又关。

“What are you doing home so early, young man?” Misato asked as she stood in front of him.

“你怎么这么早回家了，小伙子？” 美里站在他面前问道。

“I’m five minutes early,” he said after looking at his watch. “So is it safe to take a shower?”

“我早到了五分钟，”他看了看手表后说，“现在洗澡安全吗？”

“Yeah, Asuka just got out.”

“嗯，明日香刚洗完。”

“What!” he exclaimed, “What’s she been doing all day?”

“什么！”他惊呼道，“她一整天都在干什么？”

His guardian smiled faintly. “Shopping. I’ve never known a girl that takes so long to make up her mind.” Her smiled turned sly. “Though I think you’ll enjoy what she picked out.”

他的监护人微微一笑。“购物。我从没见过哪个女孩做决定要花这么长时间。”她的笑容变得狡黠。“不过我想你会喜欢她挑的东西。”

The boy smiled and backed away from his guardian, who was giving him a knowing look. “I think I’ll go take that shower now.”

男孩微笑着，从他的监护人身边退开，后者正用一种心照不宣的眼神看着他。“我想我现在要去洗个澡了。”

“You’re no fun,” muttered Misato as she watched the boy run to the bathroom.

“真没劲，” 真嗣嘟囔着，看着男孩跑向浴室。

Shrugging her shoulders, she went to one of her bags and pulled out a small box. Misato stared at it for moment, before walking over to Asuka’s purse, and putting the box in it. The older woman knew all too well what could happen tonight between the teens, the possibility of them giving in to temptation and doing something more intimate. Even Asuka’s reassurances that they were going to wait weren’t enough; all it did was prolong her worry. Knowing they would do it but not when was driving her crazy.

她耸了耸肩，走向其中一个包，从中取出一个精致的小盒子。Misato 凝视了片刻，然后走向 Asuka 的包，将盒子放了进去。这位年长女性深知今晚两个年轻人之间可能发生的事情，他们屈服于诱惑并做出更亲密举动的可能性。即便 Asuka 一再保证他们会等待，这仍不足以消除她的忧虑；这只会延长她的担忧。明知他们会这么做，却不知何时，这让她几近疯狂。

“Misato…” The woman looked up and, upon seeing Asuka, arrived at the conclusion that it would be a long night indeed.

“Misato…” 女子抬头看见 Asuka，便意识到这将是一个漫长的夜晚。

Shinji paced around his room, unable to sit down and barred from leaving it. He pulled at the collar of his shirt, loosening the black tie. Asuka had been adamant that he should wear a tuxedo to the school dance no matter what. She had allowed him to forgo the cummerbund and bow tie. Instead he had a dark blue vest and a straight tie to go with the jet-black pants and white shirt. His jacket lay on the bed while he waited. He looked at his new watch, seeing that an hour had passed since he had gotten home. As he turned, someone knocked on his door.

真嗣在他的房间里来回踱步，无法坐下，也无法离开。他拉扯着衬衫领口，松开了黑色领带。明日香坚持要他无论如何都要穿燕尾服去参加学校的舞会。她允许他省去了腰封和领结。取而代之的是一件深蓝色马甲和一条直领带，与黑色裤子和白色衬衫相配。他的外套放在床上，等待着。他看了看新手表，发现自从回家后已经过去了一个小时。当他转身时，有人敲了他的门。

“You ready?” asked Misato, not even waiting for a reply before she opened the door.

“你准备好了吗？” 问完这句话，碇真嗣甚至还没来得及回答，她就已经打开了门。

“Is she finally ready?” “她终于准备好了吗？”

“Yes.”

Shinji started to the door, but Misato grabbed his arm stopping him. He looked back and blushed as she held up the jacket with a smile. The boy slid the jacket on with his guardian’s help, buttoning the jacket closed, which drew a frown from the older woman. Sighing, he let Misato make any last minute correction to his appearance. He stood there quietly as she pulled on his sleeves, tightened his tie, and brushed the jacket of any dust. After what seemed like an eternity she finally stopped in front of him holding a corsage.

真嗣正要走向门口，但美里抓住了他的手臂阻止了他。他回头一看，脸红了，因为美里微笑着举起了外套。在监护人的帮助下，男孩穿上了外套，扣上扣子，这让年长的女士皱起了眉头。叹了口气，他让美里对他的外表做最后的调整。他静静地站在那里，她拉了拉他的袖子，紧了紧领带，拍掉了外套上的灰尘。仿佛过了一个世纪，她终于在他面前停下，手里拿着一朵胸花。

“I know she said she didn’t want one but only a fool would believe that.”

“我知道她说过她不想要，但只有傻瓜才会相信那话。”

“I know, Misato.” The boy smiled. He walked over to his desk and picked up a bundle of red and white roses.

“我知道，Misato。”男孩微笑着，走到自己的桌前，拿起一束红白相间的玫瑰。

“She can’t wear those,” she retorted.

“她不能穿那些，”她反驳道。

“Thank you,” he said, taking the corsage from Misato’s hands.

“谢谢你，”他说着，从碇真嗣手中接过花束。

With that, the two of them left and went back to the living room. Shinji felt his heart skip a beat when he saw Asuka standing there, waiting. The knee-length dress was very suggestive, clinging to Asuka's curves and was held up by thin spaghetti straps. To further draw eyes the bodice was cut low showing off the swell of the redhead's bust while two slits ran up her sides, allowing her shapely legs to show. The boy thought the black silk was a good choice as it contrasted nicely with her skin. Her hair had been cut to shoulder length and styled, the curls resting on her shoulders. He smiled at seeing the bracelet on her wrist, along with the diamond studs from their first date.

就这样，两人离开了，回到客厅。当真嗣看到明日香站在那里等待时，他的心跳漏了一拍。那条及膝裙非常诱人，紧贴着明日香的曲线，仅靠细如意大利面的肩带支撑。为了更加吸引目光，紧身胸衣的剪裁很低，展现出红发女孩胸部的隆起，而两侧的开叉则让她的修长双腿若隐若现。男孩觉得黑色丝绸是个不错的选择，因为它与她的肤色形成了很好的对比。她的头发剪到了肩膀长度并做了造型，卷发轻轻落在肩上。看到她手腕上的手链和第一次约会时的钻石耳钉，他微笑了。

“I take it from your drool that you’re impressed,” she said with a smile. Shinji nodded his head as she spun around, letting him see all of her.

“从你流口水的样子来看，你应该是被惊艳到了。”她微笑着说。真嗣点头，她便转了一圈，让他尽情欣赏。

“You’re gorgeous,” he admitted.

“你真美，”他承认道。

“I’m glad you’re impressed. I’d hate to think I lost my touch,” she commented walking up to him. The girl took the flowers from his hands and gave him a smaller, more meaningful smile. “Thank you. And you don’t look bad either.” She frowned at the look Misato was giving her. “What?”

“我很高兴你印象深刻。我可不想认为自己失去了魅力，”她边说边走向他。女孩从他手中接过花，给了他一个更小却意味深长的微笑。“谢谢你。你看起来也不错。”她对美里投来的目光皱了皱眉。“怎么了？”

“Are you wearing any underwear, young lady?”

“小姐，您现在穿着内衣吗？”

“Yes,” Asuka replied matter-of-factly.

“是的，” 明日香实事求是地回答道。

“It doesn’t look like it.” Misato scowled when the girl laughed. “What?”

“看起来不像啊。”当女孩笑起来时，碇真嗣皱起了眉头。“怎么了？”

“Trust me, I’m wearing some. Unless of course you want to look?” the redhead asked, sharply.

“相信我，我穿着呢。除非你想看看？”红发女孩尖锐地问道。

“No.” The older woman frowned slightly. “I just thought you were trying to be daring.”

“不。”年长的女士微微皱眉。“我只是以为你在尝试大胆一些。”

“I have no desire to copy your old dressing style, Misato,” the girl retorted. “I heard from Ritsuko how you used to dress in college when going out with Kaji.”

“我可不想模仿你过去的着装风格，Misato，”女孩反驳道。“我从 Ritsuko 那里听说，你大学时和 Kaji 出去时的打扮。”

“That’s…”

“Please, let’s just drop this,” begged Shinji, looking at the two women. “We’re supposed to be having fun, not talking about…”

“求求你们，我们就此打住吧，”真嗣恳求道，看着两位女士。“我们本应该享受快乐的，而不是谈论……”

Asuka stared at Shinji when he trailed, seeing his pleading eyes and nodded.

明日香盯着真嗣，见他欲言又止，看到他恳求的眼神，便点了点头。

“You’re right.” She held out her arm.” Let’s go.”

“你说的对。”她伸出胳膊。”我们走吧。”

- - - -

The two teens walked into the crowded banquet hall, its lights dimmed to provide a formal atmosphere. They paused to let their eyes adjust before making their way to the registration desk off to one side of the main entrance. Two teachers gave Asuka disapproving stares at what she was wearing, which the redhead ignored. She smirked when they were allowed to go inside. Her dress, while a little risqué, didn’t violate the dress code for the dance. She tightened her hold on the boy’s hand as a couple of girls passed them, looking at Shinji.

两位少年走进了熙熙攘攘的宴会厅，厅内的灯光调暗以营造正式氛围。他们停下脚步，让眼睛适应光线后，才向主入口一侧的登记台走去。两位老师对明日香所穿的服装投以不赞成的目光，但这位红发少女对此视而不见。当他们被允许进入时，她得意地笑了。她的裙子虽略显大胆，却并未违反舞会的着装规定。一对女孩从他们身边经过，打量着真嗣，她便更紧地握住了男孩的手。

“Asuka, the tables are that way.” The boy pointed in the opposite direction.

“明日香，桌子在那边。”男孩指向相反的方向。

“I know but there’s something I need to take care of first,” she replied, feeling him tense as they stopped outside a door. “Wait here and don’t move.”

“我知道，但有件事我得先处理一下，”她回答道，感觉到他随着他们停在一扇门外而紧张起来。“在这儿等着，别动。”

Shinji swallowed and turned around quickly as his girlfriend went through the door. He could almost hear the rumors starting as other girls approached the restroom. Slowly, he moved away from the door so that others didn’t think he was scoping out the bathroom. The young man walked inward toward the tables, staying within sight of the restroom door. He was so absorbed in looking for his friends that he didn’t notice when Asuka came out of the room.

真嗣咽了口唾沫，迅速转身，看着女友走进门去。他几乎能听到谣言开始四起，因为其他女孩正朝洗手间走来。他慢慢远离那扇门，以免别人以为他在偷窥女厕。这位年轻人向内走向餐桌，始终保持在能看见洗手间门的范围内。他全神贯注地寻找朋友，以至于没注意到明日香已经从房间里出来了。

His only warning was the feeling of a warm body pressed up against him as she leaned on him. He could smell her perfume as she gave him little kisses on the back of his neck working her way up. The boy felt his knees tremble as her soft lips stopped behind his ear, her tongue probing the small depression behind it. Moaning, he tried to turn around but she held him fast, squeezing him gently.

他唯一的警告是感觉到一个温暖的身躯紧贴着他，她靠在他身上。随着她在他的后颈上轻吻，他能闻到她的香水味，一路向上。当她柔软的嘴唇停在他的耳后，舌头探寻着耳后的凹陷时，男孩感到膝盖发软。他呻吟着试图转身，但她紧紧抓住他，温柔地挤压着他。

“Close your eyes, Shinji,” she purred in his ear.

“闭上眼睛，真嗣，”她在他的耳边低语。

The boy nodded and obeyed her wishes.

男孩点了点头，顺从了她的意愿。

“Hold out your hands,” Asuka commanded, humor in her voice.

“伸出你的手，”明日香命令道，语气中带着幽默。

Again Shinji obeyed the girl, keeping his eyes closed when something was pressed into his palm.

新二再次听从了女孩的命令，闭着眼睛时，有东西被塞进了他的手掌。

“Open your eyes.”

The boy opened his eyes and stared at what had been given to him. A small folded up piece of cloth was the only thing he saw but he saw Asuka smirk, urging him to go on. Slowly, he picked up the corners and watched it unfold into a pair of black panties trimmed in lace. Shinji stood there in shock. They were so small that he didn’t know how they would have covered her. But he didn’t let go, feeling her heat trapped in the cloth and a hint of moisture from where he was holding it.

男孩睁开眼睛，凝视着递给他的东西。他只看到一块小小的折叠布料，但看到明日香露出了坏笑，示意他继续。他缓缓地提起布料的角，看着它展开成一条镶有蕾丝边的黑色内裤。新二震惊地站在那里。内裤如此小巧，他不知道它如何能遮住她。但他没有放手，感受到布料中残留的她的体温，以及他握住的地方微微的湿润。

“A present from me,” Asuka whispered in his ear. “But next time, you get to remove them.”

“这是我给你的礼物，”明日香在他耳边低语，“但下次，你得自己来脱。”

The boy nodded, slowly folding the panties back up before slipping them in his pocket. “I don’t know what to say.”

男孩点点头，缓缓将内裤重新叠好，然后塞进口袋。“我不知道该说什么好。”

“A thank you would do, but then again the night isn’t over.”

“说声谢谢就行，不过话说回来，夜晚还没结束呢。”

“Asuka?” The boy stopped as the redhead gave him a naughty smile.

“Asuka？”男孩停下脚步，红发女孩朝他调皮一笑。

“Just wait, Shinji.”

- - - -

The streetlights flashed past the window and Shinji found himself tapping his foot as they passed. He was very tired but Asuka had promised as they left the dance, that the night wasn’t over. Glancing over he saw the redhead smile as she downshifted to take a corner. The dance had been fun, though he had had trouble keeping his mind from wandering when dancing. His brain kept reminding him that the only thing keeping his fingers from Asuka’s warm skin was less than two square yards of black silk. The boy’s eyes widened as the car pulled into the parking deck of an expensive hotel.

路灯的光影掠过车窗，真嗣发现自己随着灯光的闪过而轻敲脚尖。他非常疲惫，但离开舞会时，明日香承诺夜晚还未结束。他瞥了一眼，看到红发女孩在转弯时下换挡位，脸上挂着微笑。舞会虽然有趣，但他跳舞时却难以集中注意力。脑海中不断提醒他，手指与明日香温暖肌肤之间仅隔着不到两平方码的黑色丝绸。当车子驶入一家豪华酒店的停车场时，男孩的眼睛瞪大了。

“What are we doing here?” he asked after they had gotten out of the car.

“我们在这里做什么？”他们下车后他问道。

“This is the rest of the night,” she replied.

“这就是今晚剩下的时间了，”她回答说。

Shinji followed nervously behind, centered on Asuka as she sauntered to the elevators. He shook his head and ran to catch up to her as the doors opened. The boy wasn’t surprised when she keyed the top floor. He smiled as she turned toward him, listening to the elevator hum as it rose. Slowly he took her hand in his and drew her close, wrapping his arms around her. The kiss they shared was deep and meaningful, a reassurance of their love. Only when the doors opened did they separate.

真嗣紧张地跟在后面，目光始终不离昂首阔步走向电梯的明日香。他摇了摇头，快步追上，正好赶上电梯门打开。当她按下顶楼的按钮时，他并不感到惊讶。她转过身来，他微笑着，听着电梯上升时的嗡嗡声。他缓缓地牵起她的手，将她拉近，双臂环抱住她。他们分享的吻深沉而有意义，是对彼此爱情的确认。直到电梯门开启，他们才依依不舍地分开。

“Follow me,” Asuka said with a smile.

“跟我来，”明日香微笑着说。

The boy followed behind her as she ran ahead, pulling his arm. He ran into her when she stopped in front of a door and reached into her purse. She had a puzzled look on her face as she pulled out a box, reading the label. Her face turned bright red before she put it back in her purse. Asuka rummaged around a little longer before pulling out a key card with a triumphant smile. With a flourish, she swiped the card and pushed Shinji through the door.

男孩跟在她后面，她跑在前面拉着他的胳膊。她突然在门前停下，他撞到了她，只见她伸手到包里摸索。她拿出一个盒子，看着标签，脸上露出困惑的表情。随后她的脸变得通红，又把盒子放回了包里。明日香又翻找了一会儿，然后得意地拿出一张门卡，笑容满面。她潇洒地刷了卡，推着真嗣进了门。

“This is nice,” Shinji commented as he looked at the suite.

“这里很不错，”真嗣环顾套房时评论道。

He had heard of arrangements like this for honeymoons and retreats, but never thought he would be staying in such a place. The suite was one large bedroom, dominated by a four-poster on one side while a bar and kitchen were off to other side. Shinji swallowed as he saw the rows of mirrors, while making his way to the large windows that overlooked the city. Pressing his fingers against the glass, he felt the chill of the night through them, contrasting with how hot his body felt.

他曾听闻过这样的布置用于蜜月或静修，却未曾想过自己会住进这样的地方。套房是一间宽敞的卧室，一侧被四柱大床占据，而另一侧则设有吧台和厨房。真嗣在走向俯瞰城市的巨大窗户时，看到一排排镜子，不禁咽了口唾沫。手指轻触玻璃，夜的寒意透过指尖传来，与体内燥热形成鲜明对比。

“Shinji?”

The boy turned at her call, not hearing her come up behind him. The girl stood there with an arm under her breasts and the straps of her dress off her shoulders. As Shinji watched, she relaxed her arm, the dress sliding off of her and onto the floor. He couldn’t help but feel his heart race as the redhead stood there in the nude, waiting for his reaction. His eyes traveled over her body from her luscious breasts over her flat stomach to her mound, accented with the same soft red hair as her head and finally over the gentle swell of her hips. As he lifted his eyes, he saw her tremble, dismissing it as a reaction to the cold. But when the boy stared into her eyes he saw the fear, the nervousness that she was trying to hide. Stepping closer he raised a hand, watching her flinch, before he brushed some hair off her cheek.

男孩听到她的呼唤转过身来，并未察觉她已悄然来到身后。女孩站在那里，一只手臂托着胸部，裙子的肩带滑落至肩下。当真嗣注视着她时，她放松了手臂，裙子随之滑落至地板。他不禁感到心跳加速，因为那位红发女孩就这样赤裸地站在那里，等待着他的反应。他的目光从她丰满的胸部移至平坦的腹部，再到她那与头发同样柔软的红色发丝点缀的私密处，最后掠过她柔和的臀部曲线。当他抬起视线时，看到她在颤抖，以为是寒冷所致。但当男孩凝视她的眼睛时，他看到了她试图隐藏的恐惧和紧张。他走近一步，举起一只手，看着她畏缩，然后轻轻拂去她脸颊上的发丝。

“You don’t have to do this.” He held her gently in his arms.

“你不必这么做。”他温柔地拥抱着她。

Asuka stood there trembling. “Don’t you want me?”

明日香站在那里颤抖着。“难道你不想要我吗？”

“Yes, but you’re not ready.” He stopped as his own body reacted. “I’m not ready. Please, don’t force yourself to do this.”

“是的，但是你还没准备好。”他停了下来，因为自己的身体也有了反应。“我也没准备好。请不要勉强自己做这件事。”

She pulled back, staring into his eyes. “Who said I was forcing myself?”

她后退一步，凝视着他的眼睛。“谁说我是在勉强自己？”

“I can see it in your eyes. The fear, and the doubt.” He pressed his forehead against hers, ignoring his own trembling body. “You don’t have to go through with this. You can trust me.”

“我能从你的眼中看出。恐惧，还有疑虑。”他将自己的额头紧贴着她的，无视自己颤抖的身体。“你不必非得这么做。你可以信任我。”

The young man was prepared for anything except the reaction he got. He was suddenly holding a trembling, crying young woman in his arms as tears streamed down her cheeks. His arms tightened their hold, his hands rubbing her back and shoulders as her tears soaked his shirt and jacket. Her breathing became ragged gasps minutes later as the tears slowly ended and the tremors died down. Shinji felt his own tears on his cheeks as she stared up at his face, her eyes puffy and red from crying.

那位年轻人做好了应对一切的准备，唯独没料到会得到这样的反应。他突然间怀中抱着一个颤抖哭泣的年轻女子，泪水顺着她的脸颊流淌。他的手臂紧了紧，双手轻抚她的背部和肩膀，她的泪水浸湿了他的衬衫和外套。几分钟后，她的呼吸变得急促，抽泣声渐渐平息，颤抖也停止了。当她抬头凝视他的脸庞，眼中因哭泣而红肿时，真嗣也感觉到自己的泪水滑落脸颊。

“I’m so stupid,” she whispered. “I should have trusted you like I said I did.”

“我真傻，”她低声说，“我本该像我说的那样信任你。”

“No, you’re not,” he stated, stroking her shoulders.

“不，你不是的，”他边说边抚摸着她的肩膀。

“Still…” Asuka angrily wiped at her eyes. “Because of what some of the girls had told me earlier I make a fool of myself.”

“还是……”明日香气愤地擦了擦眼睛。“因为之前一些女生告诉我的话，我让自己出丑了。”

“What’d they tell you?” Shinji asked tentatively.

“她们跟你说了什么？”真嗣试探性地问道。

“That given a chance, any boy would jump at the opportunity for sex. They said that our promises were stupid and in vain, since you’re just a guy.” Her fists clenched at the end.

“如果给任何男孩一个机会，他们都会抓住性机会。他们说我们的承诺愚蠢且徒劳，因为你只是个男生。”她说到最后握紧了拳头。

“Don’t worry. I’d never do something like that.”

“别担心，我绝不会做那样的事。”

“Damn it, I know that!” She shook her head angrily. “It’s just when I thought about their words, I started doubting myself…” She paused, looking like she wanted to punch someone, “and you. And then came the dance announcement and their comments came faster.” She took a few deep breaths before looking at him. “I’m sorry.” Slowly she backed away, letting her arms hang down. “I’ll make it up to you somehow.”

“该死，我知道的！”她愤怒地摇了摇头，“只是当我回想起他们的话时，我开始怀疑自己……”她停顿了一下，看起来很想揍人，“还有你。然后舞会通知来了，他们的评论也接踵而至。”她深吸了几口气，然后看向他，“对不起。”她缓缓后退，双臂垂下，“我会想办法补偿你的。”

“You don’t have to do anything.”

“你不必做任何事。”

“Yes, I do,” she stated. “I have to show you I trust you. Or else…”

“是的，我确实如此，”她声明道，“我必须向你证明我信任你。否则……”

“If that’s how you feel.” The boy grinned. “Then I know the perfect punishment.”

“如果你这么觉得。”男孩咧嘴一笑。“那我知道最合适的惩罚了。”

“Shinji…” Asuka backed away, but stopped. Despite his grin, she saw his nervousness.

“真嗣…”明日香后退了几步，却又停了下来。尽管他面带笑容，她还是察觉到了他的紧张。

The young man shook his head and stepped toward her, grabbing her shoulders. Slowly he drew her closer and pressed his lips against hers, feeling her tremble. While they kissed he ran his hands along her sides but instead of coming to rest on her butt, he started tickling her. As his fingers ran across her ribs, the young woman broke the kiss, giggling. The giggling turned to laughter when he moved to under her arms. When he reached her stomach, she fell, pulling him down on top of her. As they lay on the floor, the redhead ran her fingers through his hair, twirling it around her fingers. She went flat as he placed his hands on either side of her head. Asuka couldn't help but moan as he placed kisses on her neck and upper chest before stopping on her lips. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she pulled him down, kissing him harder and letting passion flood her mind and body. She looked at him sadly as he broke the kiss.

年轻人摇了摇头，向她走去，抓住她的肩膀。他缓缓将她拉近，双唇紧贴，感受到她的颤抖。在亲吻中，他的手沿着她的身侧游走，但并未停留在她的臀部，而是开始挠她痒。当他的手指划过她的肋骨时，年轻女子忍不住笑出声来，打断了亲吻。当他移到她的腋下时，笑声变成了大笑。当他触到她的腹部时，她倒下了，把他拉倒在身上。他们躺在地板上，红发女子用手指穿过他的头发，缠绕在指间。她平躺着，他双手撑在她头两侧。当他在她的脖颈和胸口亲吻时，明日香不禁呻吟出声，最后停在了她的唇上。她双臂环抱他的脖颈，将他拉下，更热烈地吻他，让激情充盈她的身心。当他结束亲吻时，她悲伤地看着他。

“That’s all I want for now,” he said, lovingly.

“这就是我现在想要的全部，”他深情地说。

Asuka sat up, her chest rising and falling. “We can do other things besides intercourse, like…” She stopped as Shinji sat in front of her.

明日香坐起身来，胸口起伏着。“除了性交，我们还可以做些别的事情，比如……”她话音未落，真嗣便坐到了她面前。

“You’re so stubborn at times,” he told her quietly. “Don’t you remember saying you want no regrets when we finally do it?” He saw her nod. “Then how can you suggest we do other things? Wouldn’t that lessen our relationship because it shows that we couldn’t keep our promise?”

“你有时候真固执，”他轻声对她说。“你不记得自己说过，当我们最终行动时，不希望有任何遗憾吗？”他看到她点了点头。“那你怎么能提议我们做其他事情呢？那样不会削弱我们的关系吗，因为它表明我们无法遵守我们的承诺？”

“Still I owe you for not trusting you fully.”

“尽管如此，我还是欠你一个完全信任。”

“I know you trust me or you wouldn’t be here.” Shinji sighed at her expression. “You’re not going to give up until you get your way, are you?”

“我知道你信任我，否则你不会在这里。” 真嗣看着她的表情叹了口气。“你不会放弃直到你得到你想要的，对吧？”

“Nope,” she answered, smirking. “So if you don’t mind matching my dressing style, why don’t we carry on in the Jacuzzi?”

“没错，” 她回答道，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。“那么，如果你不介意配合我的着装风格，我们何不继续在按摩浴缸里呢？”

“Okay,” he agreed after a few seconds of silence.

“好的，”他沉默几秒后同意道。

Asuka laughed slightly and stood up, giving the young man an entertaining view before walking over to the Jacuzzi. Bending over, she turned on the water before glancing over her shoulder to see him stripping out of his clothes. As her eyes lowered she felt her face heat up, the same way Shinji’s had when he had looked her over. As the liquid passed the nozzles, she turned the jets on low and dumped in a cap full of soap. After the bubbles reached the top of the marble edge, she slid into the Jacuzzi, relaxing in the hot churning water. She opened her eyes when she heard the chink of glass hitting stone.

明日香轻笑一声站起身，给那年轻人留下一瞥有趣的景象，随后走向按摩浴缸。她弯腰打开水龙头，回头瞥见他正脱下衣物。当她的目光下移时，她感到脸颊发烫，正如真嗣之前打量她时的反应。随着水流过喷嘴，她将水流调至低档，并倒入一盖子沐浴露。待泡沫溢出大理石边缘，她滑入按摩浴缸，在热腾腾的水中放松。听到玻璃撞击石头的声音，她睁开了眼睛。

“I’ve never taken a bubble bath before,” he commented as he slid into the tub, opposite her.

“我以前从未泡过泡泡浴，”他一边说着，一边滑进浴缸，与她相对。

“Well this way we’re together but everything’s hidden, and we can let our imaginations run wild.”

“这样我们虽然在一起，但一切都隐藏起来了，我们可以让想象力尽情驰骋。”

“You have a perverted mind, Asuka,” he said, relaxing against the cool marble.

“你脑子里尽是些不正经的东西，明日香。”他靠在冰凉的大理石上，放松地说。

She gave him a crooked smile. “You agreed to this, so you’re just as perverted.”

她朝他露出一抹狡黠的微笑。“你既然同意了，说明你也不比我正经到哪儿去。”

“Guess so.” The boy held up the bottle of champagne that had been sitting on the bar along with two glasses. “Should we?”

“应该是这样。”男孩举起一直放在吧台上的那瓶香槟，旁边还有两只杯子。“我们该不该开呢？”

“Just one glass,” she told him, glad to see the hotel had followed her request.

“就一杯。”她对他说，很高兴酒店遵循了她的要求。

Shinji nodded, taking hold of the bottle while working the cork out.

真嗣点头，握住瓶子并拔出软木塞。

As it came out with a loud pop, the two teens jumped before laughing at their reactions. Asuka moved to the middle of the tub and held out the crystal glasses as the man poured the champagne. Once he was done, he placed the bottle on the floor within easy reach. Taking one of the glasses from the redhead’s hand, he stared at the bubbly pale liquid as the redhead returned to her side of the tub.

随着一声响亮的“砰”，两个少年吓了一跳，随后笑了起来。明日香移到浴缸中央，递出水晶杯，男子倒着香槟。倒完后，他将瓶子放在伸手可及的地板上。从红发少女手中接过一杯，他凝视着那泡沫丰富的淡色液体，红发少女则回到浴缸的另一侧。

“Different,” he commented after taking a sip. The champagne had a light, almost sweet taste, unlike the bite of hard alcohol.

“不一样，”他喝了一口后评论道。这香槟口感轻盈，几乎带点甜味，与烈酒的辛辣截然不同。

“Of course it is, Shinji,” Asuka said, drinking slowly. “You’re not supposed to get roaring drunk off it. Instead it helps you relax and lighten up.”

“当然啦，真嗣，”明日香慢慢喝着说。“你不是为了喝得酩酊大醉才喝它的。它是为了帮你放松，让你心情愉快。”

“So are you relaxed?” “那么你放松了吗？”

The girl laughed. “I’m always relaxed.”

女孩笑了。“我总是很放松。”

They sat in the Jacuzzi looking at each other, and slowly drinking the champagne. Asuka lazily reached over the side and placed her glass on the floor, holding to their promise of one drink. The combination of hot water and alcohol was having a soothing effect on the girl as she stared at her boyfriend. Smiling, she leaned back, sinking into the water until only her head was exposed; her legs stretched out and she rubbed her foot over Shinji’s.

他们坐在按摩浴缸里，彼此对视，慢慢地喝着香槟。明日香懒洋洋地伸手越过浴缸边缘，将杯子放在地板上，遵守着只喝一杯的承诺。热水和酒精的结合对女孩产生了舒缓的效果，她凝视着她的男朋友。她微笑着，向后靠去，沉入水中，直到只有头部露出水面；她的腿伸展开来，用脚蹭着真嗣的脚。

“I heard an interesting fact from Hikari,” she said.

“我从光那里听到了一个有趣的事实，”她说。

“And what’d that be?” inquired the boy as he felt her foot trace over his leg. Smirking, he returned the touch, running his toes up her smooth flesh.

“那会是什么呢？”男孩问道，感觉到她的脚在他的腿上划过。他坏笑着回应，用脚趾轻抚她光滑的肌肤。

“Something Touji told her about you describing my best feature.” She closed her eyes, bringing her other foot into play. He was a fast learner she admitted as he countered her. “So you favor my face?”

“是图治告诉她的，你描述我的最佳特征。”她闭上眼睛，用另一只脚加入游戏。她承认，他学得很快，因为他迅速应对了她的动作。“所以你偏爱我的脸？”

“Yep.” He felt her feet trap one of his before darting his other one forward, getting her to start in surprise.

“嗯，没错。”他感觉到她的脚夹住了他的一只脚，然后迅速将另一只脚向前伸，让她惊讶地开始动起来。

“Hmm, is that so?” Her eyes opened and she flashed him a mischievous grin. “What do you like the most…”

“哦，是吗？”她睁开眼睛，朝他露出了一个调皮的笑容。“你最喜欢的是什么呢……”

“I just…”

“Below my neck,” she finished.

“在我脖子以下，”她补充道。

Shinji didn’t hesitate. “Your legs.”

真嗣毫不犹豫地说：“你的腿。”

He wasn’t expecting the reaction he got from the young woman at his admission. The man watched as a slim leg rose out of the water in front of him, soap bubbles sticking to her pink skin. He gently held her foot, massaging it before running a finger up the bottom. Even as she tried to break free, laughing, he kept it up. Shinji heard her give a small content sigh, closing her eyes while she relaxed further in the hot water.

他没想到自己的加入会引起那位年轻女子如此反应。男子注视着，一条纤细的腿从他面前的水中抬起，泡沫粘附在她粉嫩的皮肤上。他轻柔地握住她的脚，按摩着，然后用手指沿着脚底向上滑动。尽管她试图挣脱，笑着，他还是继续这样做。真嗣听到她发出一声满足的轻叹，闭上眼睛，在热水中更加放松了。

Asuka settled back against the warm marble, giving in to his gentle caress. She felt the last of her soreness slowly disappearing at his touch. Her eyes flew open and she coughed on her drink when he started suckling on her toes. When she opened her mouth to protest, the man looked up with mischief in his eyes. Relaxing her shoulders, the young woman leaned back, letting herself succumb to the pampering while bringing her other foot out of the water. When she reached the end of her drink she felt her boyfriend kiss each of her toes, slightly disappointed when he finished. But as she set her glass down on the floor, the girl saw him smiling at her.

明日香靠在温暖的玛瑙石上，任由他的轻抚。她感到最后一点酸痛在他的触碰下慢慢消失。当他开始吮吸她的脚趾时，她的眼睛猛地睁开，呛到了饮料。当她张开嘴想要抗议时，男子抬头，眼中闪烁着调皮的光芒。年轻女子放松了肩膀，向后靠去，让自己沉溺于这种宠爱，同时将另一只脚从水中伸出。当她喝完饮料时，她感觉到男友亲吻了她的每一个脚趾，当他结束时，她略感失望。但当她把杯子放在地板上时，女孩看到他在对她微笑。

“That’s no fair,” she said, gliding over to him. “Now I’ll have to pay you back properly.”

“这不公平，”她说着，滑向他。“现在我得好好还你一次。”

The girl ignored the water splashing over the side as she closed the remaining distance between them. She forced his hands away from her body as he tried to hold her, pinning him to the side of the Jacuzzi. Pausing she looked him in the eyes, nervously, before leaning down tentatively and placing small kisses over his upper chest and neck, feeling him tremble at her touch. Her own body was shaking slightly as she rubbed against Shinji. Yet the feeling of control over the boy and touching him excited her. She didn’t shy away from the images her mind sent her, instead embracing them. Their lips met for an instant before she pulled away, smiling.

女孩无视水花四溅，拉近了与他的距离。她用力推开他试图抱住她的手，将他按在按摩浴缸边。她停顿了一下，紧张地看着他的眼睛，然后小心翼翼地俯身，在他胸口和脖子上轻吻，感觉到他在她的触碰下颤抖。她自己的身体也在轻微颤抖，她摩擦着真嗣。然而，控制这个男孩并触碰他的感觉让她兴奋。她没有回避脑海中的画面，反而拥抱了它们。他们的嘴唇短暂相触后，她退开，微笑着。

Shinji lay beneath her, returning the kiss and feeling desire replace his nervousness. In the back of his mind he remembered their promise but as he closed his eyes, he wondered if it would be broken that night. He thought about that for only a few seconds before her lips smothered any ability to reason. She stretched out next to him, her legs rubbing his. A gasp escaped her lips as he wrapped his arms around her, pulling the girl tighter to him, her firm breasts rubbing against his muscled chest. He moaned when a hand ran up his thigh, slowly moving to his crotch and erection.

真嗣躺在她身下，回应着她的吻，欲望取代了紧张。他脑海深处记得他们的承诺，但当他闭上眼睛时，他怀疑那晚是否会打破承诺。他只思考了几秒钟，她的唇便淹没了他的理智。她伸展身体躺在他旁边，双腿摩擦着他的。当他双臂环抱她，将女孩紧紧拉向自己，她坚实的胸部摩擦着他结实的胸膛时，她不禁轻呼一声。当一只手沿着他的大腿缓缓移向他的腹股沟和勃起时，他呻吟出声。

“I can think of things that are more interesting than legs,” she purred.

“我能想到比腿更有趣的东西，”她低声说道。

Asuka ran an exploratory hand up his hardened penis, her palm trembling as she ran it along the underside, feeling him shudder at her touch. She smiled at Shinji, as her fingers played with the head, excited at his reactions. Her hand closed around him, beginning to slowly stroke his erection while she kissed his neck. Asuka’s confidence grew at hearing the man moan, her body slowly calming at touching him. She picked up speed, her hand easily sliding along his manhood, before gripping him tighter. She listened to his breathing get heavier, watching in amusement as he closed his eyes.

明日香试探性地用手抚摸他坚硬的阴茎，手掌因激动而微微颤抖，沿着下方滑过时感受到他的颤栗。她对真嗣微笑，手指玩弄着龟头，对他的反应感到兴奋。她的手握住他，开始缓慢地抚弄他的勃起，同时亲吻他的脖子。听到男人的呻吟，明日香的信心增强，身体在触碰中逐渐平静下来。她加快了速度，手轻松地沿着他的阳具滑动，然后更紧地握住。她听着他的呼吸变得沉重，饶有兴致地看着他闭上眼睛。

“Do you want me to stop?” she asked quietly, feeling him still trembling.

“你想让我停下来吗？”她轻声问道，感觉到他仍在颤抖。

His eyes opened briefly and he shook his head.

他的眼睛短暂地睁开，然后摇了摇头。

“So isn’t this much better than legs?” she purred, tightening her grip before relaxing it.

“所以，这难道不比双腿好得多吗？”她低声说着，收紧了她的抓握，然后又放松了。

Shinji lay there moaning as she continued to caress him, her touch gentle while she worked him to a climax. He opened his eyes as she changed her technique once again, concentrating on the head. The girl’s fist closed around him, her fingers and palm giving constant stimulation. It was too much when her other hand cupped his testicles, kneading them. His body tensed and he gritted his teeth to fight the sensations.

真嗣躺在那里呻吟着，她继续抚摸他，她的触碰温柔而细腻，使他逐渐达到高潮。当他睁开眼睛时，她又一次改变了手法，专注于他的头部。女孩的拳头紧紧包裹着他，手指和手掌不断地给予刺激。当她的另一只手捧住他的睾丸并揉捏时，他再也承受不住了。他的身体紧绷，咬紧牙关以抵抗这感觉。

“Asu…” he couldn’t finish saying her name as he released all his pent up passion.

“明…”他还没来得及叫出她的名字，就释放了所有积压的激情。

Asuka grinned at the results of her work as he climaxed. She didn’t stop her hand job, picking up the pace, determined to get all she could out of him, even as she felt a hot rush against her hand. Leaning closer, she kissed him lightly on the cheek, groaning as he squeezed her butt, hard. When he finally grew limp in her hand she released him, sliding around in front of him. She smiled nervously when his eyes opened.

明日香看着自己的成果，他达到高潮时露出了笑容。她没有停止手上的动作，反而加快了速度，决心要从他身上得到所有能得到的，即使感觉到一股热流涌向她的手。她倾身向前，轻轻地吻了他的脸颊，当他用力捏她的臀部时，她不禁呻吟。当他终于在她手中变得无力时，她放开了他，滑到他面前。当他的眼睛睁开时，她紧张地笑了。

“Now it’s my turn,” she said.

“现在轮到我了，”她说。

The boy watched, tired, as Asuka stood up and stepped out of the tub. He continued to stare as the redhead walked over to the bed, water dripping off her body. She didn’t say anything as she lay on the bed, staring at him and waiting. Shinji got out of the Jacuzzi, dimming the lights, and walked over to her. He paused when he reached the edge of the bed, staring at the gorgeous young woman on it. She lay stretched out, her long, sexy legs crossed at the ankles while she looked up at him, propped up on her elbows. Her skin was a lovely shade of pink while her beautiful, pale mounds shone in the moonlit room. Shinji swallowed as he stared at her beautiful face: the high cheekbones, soft pouting lips, her small delicate nose. But what captivated him the most were her big blue eyes, shining with excitement and desire.

男孩疲惫地看着，只见明日香站起身，跨出了浴缸。他继续凝视着，红发少女走向床边，水珠从她身上滴落。她躺在床上，望着他，一言不发地等待着。真嗣从按摩浴缸中起身，调暗灯光，走向她。当他走到床边时，停下脚步，凝视着床上那位美丽的年轻女子。她伸展开来，修长迷人的双腿在脚踝处交叠，仰望着他，肘部支撑着身体。她的肌肤呈现出迷人的粉红色，而她那美丽的苍白山峰在月光照耀的房间里闪闪发光。真嗣凝视着她美丽的脸庞，咽了口口水：高高的颧骨，柔软的噘嘴，小巧精致的鼻子。但最让他着迷的是她那双大而蓝的眼睛，闪烁着兴奋和渴望的光芒。

“Still think my face and legs are my best features?”

“还觉得我的脸和腿是我最好的特征吗？”

“I’ll have to think about that now.”

“我现在得考虑一下这个问题。”

Asuka smiled, looking at him as he stared at her. Licking her lips, she definitely knew he was no longer the little boy she had met years ago. The scrawny chest and arms were gone, replaced by well-defined muscles. His legs were ones of a runner, muscled but not bulging. She blushed as she wondered how good his stamina would be. Her eyes fell lower when she thought of that, staring at his manhood. Smirking, she looked up at him, losing herself in his eyes, always full of love. As he lowered himself onto the bed, she ran a hand down his back like he had done to her.

明日香微笑着，看着他凝视她的眼神。她舔了舔嘴唇，确信他已不再是多年前她遇到的小男孩。那瘦弱的胸膛和手臂已不复存在，取而代之的是线条分明的肌肉。他的双腿像是跑者的腿，肌肉结实而不臃肿。她脸颊泛红，好奇他的耐力会有多好。当她想到这里，目光不由自主地向下移，凝视着他的男性象征。她嘴角上扬，抬头望向他，沉醉在他充满爱意的眼神中。当他俯身躺到床上时，她像他曾经对她做的那样，用手轻抚他的背。

Shinji gasped when she grabbed him but continued to lower himself until he was just above the woman. He leaned down and kissed her, feeling Asuka wrap an arm around his neck, pulling him down. She snaked her tongue into his mouth, groaning when he captured it with his lips, before darting his own tongue into her mouth. They separated only when he was fully on the bed. Slowly the two young lovers reached out for each other.

当她抓住他时，真嗣倒吸一口凉气，但还是继续俯身，直到他刚好悬在那女子上方。他俯身吻了她，感觉到明日香用一只手臂环住他的脖子，将他拉下。她将舌头探入他的口中，当他用嘴唇捕捉住她的舌头时，她发出了一声呻吟，随后他的舌头也探入她的口中。直到他完全躺在床上，他们才分开。慢慢地，这对年轻的恋人伸出手去触碰对方。

The girl stared at him in anticipation, moaning when he cupped one of her breasts. She frowned at feeling his hand quiver.

女孩满怀期待地盯着他，当他捧起她的一只乳房时，她发出了一声呻吟。感觉到他的手在颤抖，她皱起了眉头。

“Quit trembling, you’ll be fine.” Asuka placed her hand on his, holding it in place. “Just…don’t be rough.”

“别发抖了，你会没事的。” 明日香把手放在他的手上，稳住它。“只是……别太粗暴。”

“Are you sure?” whispered Shinji.

“你确定吗？” 真嗣低声问道。

“Yes!”

She shivered as he squeezed her gently before running his fingers over her flesh. Squirming under his touch, she wanted more and was shocked when he stopped. Glaring up at him, she saw him smiling. The redhead gasped when his finger made contact with a small delicate nipple, pressing down on it. Her back arched as he took the erect bud between his fingers and pinched gently. Snuggling against the pillows, she sighed as he cupped both her breasts, his hands brushing over them.

他轻柔地握住她，随后手指滑过她的肌肤，她不禁打了个寒颤。在他的触碰下扭动着，她渴望更多，却在他停下时感到震惊。她怒视着他，只见他面带微笑。当他的手指触碰到一个小巧精致的乳头并施加压力时，红发女子倒吸一口凉气。她的背部弓起，他捏住那挺立的乳尖，轻柔地夹紧。她依偎在枕头上，叹了口气，他双手捧住她的双乳，手指轻抚其上。

“Don’t tease me anymore,” she begged, her voice trembling after several minutes of his massaging.

“别再逗我了，”她恳求道，声音在经过他数分钟的按摩后微微颤抖。

Shinji nodded, releasing his hold. He felt Asuka resist when he made her lay on her side, facing away, but soon felt her relax against him. She looked over her shoulder, smiling, as she felt his manhood against her backside. He grinned back as he felt her skin against his torso. Slowly he snaked an arm under her, cupping one of her breasts, and started kneading it. He was careful not to squeeze too hard, knowing the goal was to pleasure her, not hurt her.

真嗣点了点头，松开了手。当他让明日香侧躺，背对着他时，他感觉到她有所抗拒，但很快她就放松下来，依偎在他怀里。她回头微笑着，感觉到他的男性象征紧贴着她的背部。他回以微笑，感受着她肌肤与自己胸膛的接触。他缓缓地将一只手臂伸到她身下，握住她的一侧乳房，开始轻轻揉捏。他小心翼翼，不捏得太紧，知道目的是让她愉悦，而非伤害她。

The young man couldn’t believe what he was doing with Asuka. Her body was soft and warm, he wanted to hold her forever. It seemed all a unreal, remembering the girl who hated anyone touching or staring at her. Now she was letting him massage her in the most intimate of places, showing her complete trust. Still his hands trembled, testament to his fear of doing something wrong. The thought disappeared when she moaned while he ran his hand over her silky skin on the way to her lower body. Every little sound and movement was a reminder she was enjoying what he was doing. Without stopping he placed a couple of quick kisses on her neck.

年轻人难以置信自己正与明日香所做之事。她的身体柔软而温暖，他渴望永远拥抱着她。这一切仿佛不真实，回想起那个厌恶任何人触碰或凝视的女孩。如今她却允许他在最私密之处为她按摩，展现出全然的信任。尽管如此，他的双手仍微微颤抖，这是他害怕做错事的明证。当他的手滑过她丝滑的肌肤，向她下身移动时，她的一声呻吟让这念头烟消云散。她每一个细微的声音和动作都在提醒他，她正享受着他的抚慰。他未曾停歇，迅速在她的颈间印下几个吻。

The girl’s moans increased as his fingers danced along her stomach, working their way over her body. She trembled as his fingers brushed against the swell of her free breast but never cupping it. The redhead pushed against him harder as he reached her lower body, stroking her slender legs. A groan escaped her lips at his fingers finding a spot behind her knee before working his way up her slender leg to her waist. She started squirming as the pleasure slowly built in her body. Opening her mouth, she was about to tell him to get to work when his hand stroked her inner thigh. Her nails dug into his hand as he worked his way higher, crying out when he made contact.

随着他的手指在她的腹部舞动，沿着她的身体游走，女孩的呻吟声越来越大。当他的手指轻触到她那自由晃动的乳房的隆起时，她颤抖了，但并未握住它。红发女孩更加用力地推着他，当他抚摸她纤细的双腿时。他的手指触碰到她膝盖后方的某个位置，随后沿着她修长的腿向上移动至腰际，她不禁发出一声呻吟。随着快感在体内逐渐累积，她开始扭动身体。她张开嘴，正要告诉他开始工作时，他的手抚摸到了她的大腿内侧。随着他继续向上探索，她的指甲深深嵌入他的手中，当他的手指触碰到她时，她忍不住叫出声来。

“Asuka?”

“I’m okay,” she moaned, encouraging him to continue.

“我没事，”她呻吟着，鼓励他继续。

“I’m not hurting you?” “我没有弄疼你吧？”

“No!” she replied, her fingers resting over his as she guided him. When he began to stroke her moist, delicate petals, the redhead closed her eyes, surrendering to the sensations running through her body.

“没有！”她回答道，手指轻轻搭在他的手上引导着他。当他开始抚摸她湿润娇嫩的花瓣时，红发女子闭上了眼睛，任由身体中的感觉席卷全身。

Shinji lay there gently caressing her warm folds while she mewled in ecstasy, enjoying the feeling of her body as she trembled in his arms. Slowly he spread her lips, letting his middle finger trace small circles around her sensitive flesh. He continued to gently rub her, amazed by her reactions. The girl started writhing against him as he tickled her lightly, before gently sliding his finger into her. He was surprised at how hot and wet her vagina was, as he wiggled his finger before withdrawing. He smiled, listening to the redhead’s fast breathing as she gripped his hand tighter. The man was shocked when she wrapped her leg over him, but returned to pleasuring her. Her body tensed when his finger made contact with her clitoris.

真嗣轻柔地抚摸着她温暖的褶皱，而她则在极乐中轻声呻吟，享受着身体在他怀中颤抖的感觉。他缓缓分开她的唇瓣，用中指在她的敏感肌肤上画着小圈。他继续温柔地抚弄她，对她反应之强烈感到惊讶。女孩开始在他身上扭动，当他轻挠她时，然后温柔地将手指滑入她的体内。他惊讶于她的阴道如此炽热湿润，他扭动手指后又抽出。他微笑着，听着红发女孩急促的呼吸，她紧紧抓住他的手。当她用腿缠绕住他时，男子感到震惊，但他又继续取悦她。当他的手指触碰到她的阴蒂时，她的身体紧绷起来。

Asuka stared at the far wall, enjoying the feeling of his fingers on her body. He was so gentle with his touches, never groping or playing rough. Here she was, letting a boy touch her most private parts, and she was enjoying it. She could feel her body slowly heating up from her desires and his constant massaging. Every time he touched her warm flesh her pleasure grew.

明日香凝视着远处的墙壁，享受着他手指在身上的触感。他的触碰如此温柔，从不粗鲁或用力。此刻，她正让一个男孩触摸她最私密的部位，而她正享受着这一切。她能感觉到自己的身体因欲望和不断的按摩而逐渐升温。每当他触碰她温暖的肌肤，她的快感就愈发强烈。

“Do you like this?” Shinji whispered timidly.

“你喜欢这个吗？” 真嗣怯生生地低声问道。

“Mmmhmm,” the redhead moaned when Shinji tickled her clitoris through its hood, caught between pleasure and pain. Pleasure at how good he was making her feel and pain at how strong the pleasure was.

“嗯嗯，”红发女孩在真嗣轻触她的阴蒂时呻吟着，夹杂着快感与痛楚。快感来自于他让她感觉如此美妙，痛楚则源于快感之强烈。

“Harder.”

“What?”

Gripping his hand on her breast she encouraged him to squeeze her harder, groaning when he did. She closed her eyes, concentrating on relaxing after he picked up his stimulation. Her breath caught in her throat when he squeezed her clitoris gently before returning to his stroking. As his finger brushed up against her directly, the sensations overwhelmed her, pushing her over the edge. It felt like something inside of her snapped as she let out a long, piercing scream. Her inner muscles contracted as she orgasmed, her nails digging into Shinji’s hand.

她紧握着他的手放在自己的胸前，鼓励他用力挤压，当他这样做时，她不禁呻吟出声。她闭上眼睛，集中精力放松，因为他在加强刺激。当他轻轻捏住她的阴蒂时，她的呼吸在喉咙里停滞了，随后他又恢复了抚摸。当他的手指直接触碰到她时，强烈的快感让她无法自持，将她推向了高潮的边缘。她感觉体内仿佛有什么东西断裂了，随之发出一声长长的、尖锐的尖叫。她的内部肌肉紧缩，达到了性高潮，指甲深深嵌入真嗣的手中。

The young man wasn’t ready for what happened when Asuka reached her climax. He thought he had hurt her when she had screamed suddenly and her body went ridged. His hand ached where she had gripped him, and he felt a film of hot fluid on his fingers. Holding her in his arms, he waited for her tremors to subside and her breathing to return to normal. Removing his hand from between her legs, he wiped it off on the sheet behind him, before wrapping his arms around her again. Gently he pulled her onto him, after she had turned to face him again, so they were staring at each other.

当明日香达到高潮时，这位年轻人并没有准备好迎接接下来发生的事情。她突然尖叫，身体僵硬，他以为自己弄痛了她。她的紧握让他的手感到疼痛，手指上还残留着温热的液体。他抱着她，等待她的颤抖平息，呼吸恢复正常。他从她双腿间抽出手，在身后的床单上擦干净，然后再次将她拥入怀中。当她再次面向他时，他温柔地将她拉到自己身上，两人就这样对视着。

Asuka lay on top of Shinji lost in the euphoria of her orgasm. Her body still trembled as pleasure continued to run through her. It had come as a total surprise to the girl, thinking she would have had more signs of reaching her climax. One moment she was moaning as the pleasure continued to grow from fingers stroking her and the next her entire body was a conductor of pleasure and excitement. She was sure there was no way to top what she had just experienced but she reminded herself they hadn’t had sex yet. Her opinion could change when she had experienced everything. For now she looked down weakly at her boyfriend.

明日香躺在真嗣身上，沉浸在高潮的狂喜中。她的身体仍在颤抖，快感持续流遍全身。这对女孩来说完全出乎意料，她本以为会有更多迹象表明自己即将达到高潮。前一刻她还在呻吟，快感随着手指的抚摸不断增长，下一刻她的整个身体就成了快感和兴奋的导体。她确信没有什么能超越刚才的体验，但她提醒自己他们还没有发生性关系。她的看法可能会在体验过一切后改变。此刻，她虚弱地低头看着她的男朋友。

“I knew we could find some other uses for those fingers, Shinji,” she purred, suddenly feeling tired. Giving him a small smile, she closed her eyes falling asleep against him, missing his own smile as he covered them.

“我就知道你的手指还有别的用处，真嗣。”她低声说道，突然感到疲倦。她对他微微一笑，闭上眼睛，靠在他身上睡着了，错过了他盖住他们时的微笑。

- - - -

Shinji awoke to bright light and the sound of a door being opened. He had to blink when he opened his eyes, the mirrors reflecting the late morning sun directly into his face. Sitting up, he saw what had woken him. Asuka, with a robe wrapped around her, was at the door to the suite, talking to someone in a quiet voice. He tensed and pulled the sheets tighter around himself, when a man dressed in the uniform of the hotel pushed a small cart into the room. The young man blushed when he made eye contact with the older gentleman, who smiled knowingly before leaving.

真嗣醒来时，眼前是明亮的光线和开门的声音。他睁开眼睛时不得不眨了眨，因为镜子反射着上午的阳光直射他的脸。坐起身来，他看到了是什么唤醒了他。明日香裹着一件浴袍，站在套房的门口，正低声与某人交谈。当一个穿着酒店制服的男子推着一辆小推车进入房间时，他紧张起来，把床单拉得更紧了。年轻男子与那位年长的绅士对视时脸红了，后者会意地微笑后离开了。

“So you’re finally awake,” she commented, walking toward the bed, carrying a bowl of fruit. “Was last night too much for you?” She said the last part with smile on her lips, setting the bowl on the nightstand.

“你终于醒了啊，”她评论道，端着一碗水果走向床边。“昨晚是不是太过了？”她说到最后，嘴角带着微笑，将碗放在床头柜上。

“Nope.”

He reached out and drew her closer, holding Asuka gently in his arms. Shinji didn’t know how one person could mean so much to him and make him feel so lost at the same time. The night before seemed like a blur: from the dance and dinner to the hotel room with the Jacuzzi and champagne. But it was the last part of the night that held the most significance. All the touches and kisses came back to him while he slowly undid her robe, seeing her gorgeous warm body underneath as he pulled it open.

他伸出手，将她拉近，温柔地拥抱着明日香。真嗣不知道一个人怎么能对他如此重要，同时又让他感到如此迷茫。前一晚的记忆如同模糊不清：从舞蹈和晚餐到带有按摩浴缸和香槟的酒店房间。但正是夜晚的最后部分，意义最为重大。所有的触碰和亲吻在他缓缓解开她的睡袍时涌上心头，他看到她那美丽温暖的身躯在睡袍下显露出来。

Asuka yelped in surprise when he pulled her down onto the bed, rolling her onto her back. She looked up, dazed, as Shinji straddled her, his hands on her shoulders. The redhead nodded at the unspoken question in his eyes. She had never thought that one person could ever excite her so much or capture her heart like Shinji had done.

当真嗣将她拉倒在床上，让她仰面躺下时，明日香惊讶地叫了一声。她抬头望去，眼神迷离，只见真嗣跨坐在她身上，双手搭在她的肩上。红发女孩对上他眼中未言明的问题，点了点头。她从未想过有谁能像真嗣那样让她如此激动，或是像他那样俘获她的心。

“Close your eyes,” instructed Shinji, giving her a kiss on the forehead.

“闭上眼睛，”真嗣指导道，并在她额头上亲了一下。

“This had better be good,” she said before snuggling against the pillows.

“这最好是有趣的，”她说完便依偎在枕头里。

The redhead chuckled at his mischievous smile and remembering the night before, closed her eyes, relaxing in anticipation of what he would do to her. She frowned when he didn’t move for a few moments. She was about to open her eyes when he shifted around but didn’t as he hadn’t left the bed.

红发女子对他的调皮笑容轻声笑了出来，回想起前一晚，她闭上眼睛，放松地期待着他将对她做什么。当他在几秒钟内没有动作时，她皱起了眉头。正当她准备睁开眼睛时，他动了一下，但没有离开床。

She reached out blindly for his body when she felt his lips on her neck, pulling him closer as he worked his way up, kissing her chin and cheeks tenderly. His tongue ran across her lips, causing her to press back harder against him, all the while rubbing his back. Her eyes opened in surprise when he pulled back, seeing him holding a strawberry in his hand.

当她感觉到他的嘴唇贴在她的脖子上时，她盲目地伸手去抓他的身体，将他拉得更近，而他则温柔地亲吻她的下巴和脸颊。他的舌头滑过她的嘴唇，使她更加用力地回吻他，同时抚摸着他的背。当他突然退后时，她惊讶地睁开了眼睛，看到他手里拿着一颗草莓。

“I guess it would have worked out better if I had followed your request,” she muttered, slowly eating the strawberry. She stroked his cheek when she was done. The redhead grinned mischievously. “Though we share it next time in a different way.”

“我猜如果我按照你的要求去做，结果可能会更好，”她喃喃自语，慢慢地吃着草莓。吃完后，她抚摸着他的脸颊。红发女子狡黠地笑了。“不过下次我们换个方式分享。”

“Okay,” he replied. “So do you…”

“好的，”他回答道。“那你……”

“Yes.”

The young man grinned, giving her a kiss before starting his way down her body. He kissed her tenderly over her beautiful upper chest, giving each of her luscious breasts a couple quick kisses. Her wiggling caused him to smile when he kissed around her belly button. Rubbing her shoulders and arms, he traced his way back up between her breasts with his tongue before going back down to her navel. Her back arched and she wrapped her legs around him when he started going lower toward her mound. Shinji placed a couple kisses just above her pubic hair, his hands massaging her lower body, gliding over her smooth skin. Asuka loosened her legs, sitting up when he stopped kissing her, allowing him to come back up to her head.

年轻人咧嘴一笑，在她唇上轻啄后，便开始沿着她的身体向下探索。他温柔地吻过她美丽的上胸，对那对诱人的乳房轻快地吻了几下。她扭动的身姿让他微笑，当他的吻围绕着她的肚脐时。他轻抚她的肩膀和手臂，用舌头在双乳间缓缓上溯，随后又回到她的肚脐。当他继续向下，朝她的私密处进发时，她背部拱起，双腿紧紧缠绕住他。真嗣在她阴毛上方轻吻几下，双手按摩着她的下身，滑过她光滑的肌肤。当他停止亲吻，明日香松开双腿，坐起身来，让他得以重新回到她的头部。

“I always knew you were a pervert,” she whispered in his ear, while he held her.

“我一直知道你是个变态，”她在他耳边低语，而他正抱着她。

“Didn’t you say…” “你不是说过……”

The woman smirked at his gasp when she made contact with his manhood. She slowly drew her hand up his member, feeling him grow hard at her touch. Pushing Shinji onto his back, she knelt next to him, picking up her pace while her other hand rubbed his chest. Leaning down, she kissed him on the neck listening to his heavy breathing before reaching his lips. Snaking her tongue into his mouth, Asuka stared into his eyes while they kissed, feeling him rubbing her shapely butt with one hand. Breaking the kiss and her touch, she laid on top of him, rubbing her breasts against his chest.

女子对他因接触到他的男性部位而发出的惊呼报以一抹微笑。她缓缓地用手抚上他的那部分，感受着他在她的触碰下逐渐坚硬。她将真嗣推倒在床上，跪在他身旁，加快了手上的动作，另一只手则揉搓着他的胸膛。俯身下去，她在他的脖颈上亲吻，聆听着他沉重的呼吸声，随后吻上了他的唇。在舌尖探入他口中时，明日香凝视着他的双眼，感受他用一只手抚摸着她那曲线优美的臀部。结束亲吻和抚摸后，她伏在他身上，让双乳与他的胸膛摩擦。

“Does that answer your question?” she asked, getting a moan for an answer. “It’s nice that I can get your full attention with a soft touch.”

“这个回答你满意吗？”她问道，换来了一声呻吟作为回应。“真好，我只需轻轻一触就能完全吸引你的注意。”

Asuka smiled softly, waiting to see what he’d do. She wrapped her arms around him as he gripped her shoulders and rolled, switching their positions so he was above her. She squirmed when he grabbed her arms, holding her in place for a moment as he grinned at her. Her breathing quickened when he released her and he leaned down, placing tender kisses on her breasts, working his way to her small, delicate nipples. Relaxing, the redhead lay on her back, staring up at the ceiling letting the pleasure run through her slim body.

明日香温柔地微笑着，等待看他会做什么。她双臂环抱住他，而他紧抓她的肩膀，翻身交换了他们的位置，使自己位于她上方。当他的手抓住她的手臂，将她固定住片刻时，她扭动着身体，而他则对她咧嘴一笑。当他放开她，俯身轻吻她的胸部，一路吻至她小巧精致的乳头时，她的呼吸急促起来。红发的她放松地躺在背上，仰望天花板，任由快感流遍她纤细的身体。

Shinji listened to the young woman whimper, feeling her tremble as his tongue circled around her warm flesh, getting closer to the center. With just the tip he traced around her pink areola before brushing across her nipple, getting the redhead to arch her back. He continued to tease her with feathery touches, feeling the nub of flesh hardening from his work. The young man released Asuka’s arms when he switched to her other breast, repeating his technique, while one hand massaged the pale mound he had just left.

真嗣聆听着年轻女子的啜泣声，感受着她因他的舌头在温暖的肌肤上打转而颤抖，逐渐逼近中心。他仅用舌尖描绘着她粉红色的乳晕，随后轻拂过她的乳头，使得红发女子不由自主地挺直了背。他继续用羽毛般的触感挑逗她，感受到那肉粒因他的动作而变得坚硬。当年轻男子转向她的另一侧乳房，重复他的技巧时，他松开了明日香的手臂，同时一手揉捏着刚刚离开的苍白丘陵。

“Looks like I’m not the only one to get hard at a gentle touch,” he commented, giving her erect nubs a kiss. “And it wasn’t nice what you did to me.”

“看来我并非唯一一个因温柔触碰而兴奋的人，”他评论道，亲吻了她挺立的乳头。“而你之前对我的所作所为可不太友好。”

“So how do you want to correct that transgression, Shinji?” she asked, smirking.

“那么，你想如何纠正那个过失呢，真嗣？”她带着一丝戏谑问道。

His fingers traced over the delicate skin of her thigh before he replied. “We could just repeat last night.”

他的手指轻抚过她大腿上细腻的肌肤，然后回答道：“我们何不重温昨晚呢？”

“Such a boring little boy, aren’t you? Don’t you have an imagination?” She grinned at his expression. “Care to join me in the shower?”

“真是个无趣的小男孩，不是吗？你没有想象力吗？”她看着他的表情咧嘴一笑，“想和我一起洗澡吗？”

Minutes later, the aroused teens were surrounded by sprays of hot water, their lips locked together in a passionate kiss. Asuka slowly backed away from Shinji, a grin on her face as she altered the settings of the shower. Soon the enclosure was filled with a gentle mist, keeping their bodies slick with moisture. Licking her lips, the redhead grabbed the body shampoo and a wash cloth, advancing on the young man. Her eyes dropped to his hardness and she wondered how much longer she could wait.

几分钟后，被激发的青少年们被热水喷雾包围，他们的嘴唇紧紧相扣，热情地亲吻着。明日香缓缓从真嗣身边退开，脸上带着一丝笑意，调整着淋浴的设置。很快，这个空间充满了柔和的雾气，让他们的身体保持湿润。红发女孩舔了舔嘴唇，抓起沐浴露和浴巾，向年轻男子逼近。她的目光落在了他的坚挺上，心中暗自思忖还能等多久。

“Hey!” she protested when he grabbed the lathered cloth out of her hands. “You were…”

“嘿！”她抗议道，当他从她手中夺走那块涂满肥皂的布时。“你刚才……”

“Umm…I went first yesterday,” he whispered.

“嗯……我昨天先洗的，”他低声说。

She smiled. “Ladies first, huh?”

她微笑着说：“女士优先，对吧？”

“I guess so.” Still his hand shook lightly at what he was going to do.

“我想是的。”尽管如此，他的手还是因即将要做的事而微微颤抖。

“Then stop shaking,” she said, wrapping her arms around his neck. “You’re not going to hurt me.”

“那就别抖了，”她说着，双臂环抱住他的脖子。“你不会伤害我的。”

“I know,” he replied. “And you’re trembling also.”

“我知道，”他回答道，“而且你也在发抖。”

“Not as much as you.” She smirked suddenly.

“没你抖得厉害。”她突然咧嘴一笑。

Shinji watched as the redhead broke contact with him and turned her back to him, placing her hands against the wall. The way rivulets of water slid down her body and how her smooth skin had taken on a pink hue once again was almost too much for the young man. It took a lot of willpower to resist asking her to go all the way when she looked over her shoulder, her auburn hair sticking to her skin.

真嗣看着红发女孩与他断开接触，转身背对他，双手撑在墙上。水珠顺着她身体滑落的模样，以及她光滑肌肤再次泛起的粉红色泽，几乎让这位年轻人难以自持。当她回头望向他，赤褐色头发贴在肌肤上时，他费了很大劲才克制住自己没有请求她彻底放纵。

“Come on,” she told him giving him a small nervous smile.

“来吧，”她对他说道，给了他一个略带紧张的微笑。

Shaking his head, he closed the distance between them, dropping to a knee behind her. Working slowly, he ran the cloth up her long, slender legs, covering them in white lather while working his way up her body.

他摇了摇头，缩短了与她之间的距离，跪在她身后。他动作缓慢，用布从她修长的双腿向上擦拭，覆盖上一层白色泡沫，并继续向上涂抹至她的身体。

The redhead groaned in frustration as he avoided massaging her wet petals, instead running his hands over her firm rear, kneading her flesh. As his fingers ran up her back and up over her shoulders, Asuka found herself again slipping into a state of complete relaxation at his actions. She trembled when he leaned against her back, feeling his erection pressed against her butt, his hands slipping around to her front. Looking over her shoulder, she tried to stop shaking, seeing he was just as nervous as she was. Pleasure rose as slick fingers traced over the curves of her breasts, brushing against her erect nipples. A whimper escaped her lips when he pinched one of the hardened nubs, grabbing his hand when he pulled on it.

红发女子懊恼地呻吟着，他避开抚摸她湿润的花瓣，转而双手游走在她结实的臀部，揉捏着她的肌肤。当他的手指沿着她的背部向上，越过她的肩膀时，明日香再次在他的动作中陷入了完全的放松状态。当他靠在她的背上，感受到他的勃起紧贴着她的臀部，双手滑向她的前方时，她颤抖了。她回头望去，试图停止颤抖，发现他同样紧张。随着滑腻的手指沿着她乳房的曲线游走，轻触她挺立的乳头，快感升腾。当他捏住其中一个硬挺的乳头时，她不由自主地发出一声呜咽，抓住他的手阻止他拉扯。

“Sorry,” mumbled Shinji at her glare.

“对不起，”真嗣在她怒视下嘟囔道。

She smiled as she turned around. “It’s all right. Just remember…”

她转过身来，微笑着说：“没关系。只是要记住……”

“Be gentle.”

They both laughed when Shinji completed her instructions; the mood relaxed further. The young man looked her over, his breath catching in his throat at having a gorgeous woman for a girlfriend. He found himself lost in her big blue eyes, forgetting what he was supposed to do until she brought him back with a kiss and a touch. She wrapped an arm around his neck, getting their bodies to touch as he ran the cloth over her lovely skin. She started wiggling as he crossed over her flat stomach.

当真嗣完成她的指示时，两人都笑了，气氛更加轻松。年轻人打量着她，因为拥有一位美丽的女友而感到呼吸一窒。他发现自己迷失在她那双大大的蓝眼睛里，直到她用一个吻和一次触碰将他拉回现实。她用一只手臂环住他的脖子，让他们的身体紧贴，而他则用布轻轻擦拭她美丽的肌肤。当他越过她平坦的腹部时，她开始扭动身体。

A long shuddering moan escaped her lips when the cloth rubbed over her hips, slowly working inward. Asuka felt Shinji cup one of her round breasts with his free hand, and squeeze gently when he made contact with her wet petals. She started squirming when the cloth was replaced with slick fingers, gliding up and down her lips. Reaching down she took his hardness in her hand, slowly stroking when she felt the man spread her labia. She kissed Shinji hard as they continued to pleasure each other, their hands remembering the pleasurable places.

当布料摩擦过她的臀部，缓缓向内移动时，她发出了一声长长的颤抖呻吟。阿苏卡感觉到真嗣用空闲的手握住她圆润的乳房，当他的手指触碰到她湿润的花瓣时，他轻轻地捏了一下。当布料被滑腻的手指取代，沿着她的唇瓣上下滑动时，她开始扭动身体。她伸手握住他的坚硬，当她感觉到男人分开她的阴唇时，她慢慢地抚摸着。她用力吻了真嗣，他们继续互相取悦，他们的手记得那些愉悦的地方。

Asuka groaned into the kiss when he made contact with her sensitive clitoris. Her breathing became faster as he stroked the little nub through its hood. Remembering the night before, she picked up the pace, not knowing how soon she’d reach her climax. She smiled at the expression on his face as he tried to hold back. Concentrating on just his hard shaft, she gripped him harder staring into his eyes. A whimper escaped their kiss when his finger made direct contact, giving slow steady stimulation. Each knew the other couldn’t last much longer and increased their pace.

当他触碰到她敏感的阴蒂时，阿苏卡在亲吻中呻吟起来。随着他通过包皮抚摸那个小突起，她的呼吸变得急促。回想起前一晚，她加快了节奏，不知道自己何时会达到高潮。她对着他试图抑制的表情微笑。专注于他坚硬的阴茎，她握得更紧，凝视着他的眼睛。当他的手指直接接触到那里，给予缓慢而稳定的刺激时，他们的亲吻中漏出了一声呜咽。两人都知道对方坚持不了多久，于是加快了节奏。

Both broke the kiss at the same time; their mouths open gasping for breath. Asuka again let out a long, shuddering moan as she orgasmed. She felt her body trembling as it succumbed to the orgasm. Her nails dug into Shinji’s shoulder, feeling his hardened penis pulse in her other hand. Pain shot through her chest as Shinji squeezed her breast, lost in his own climax. When her orgasm died, she leaned against Shinji for support, feeling him do the same.

两人同时结束了亲吻，嘴巴张开急促地呼吸着。阿苏卡再次发出长长的、颤抖的呻吟，她在高潮中释放了自己。她感觉到自己的身体在颤抖，屈服于高潮之中。她的指甲深深嵌入真嗣的肩膀，感受到他坚硬的阴茎在她另一只手中跳动。当真嗣在高潮中紧握她的乳房时，疼痛穿透了她的胸膛。当她的高潮消退后，她靠在真嗣身上寻求支撑，感觉到他也在做同样的事。

The young man pulled back and looked at Asuka, passion and excitement still flooding his mind and body. He felt this session was better than the night before. Her body had taken on a rosy color from the pleasure and the heat of the shower. As they stood there catching their breaths, he wrapped his arms around her wet body; her breasts rubbing against his chest, eliciting slight moans from the redhead. He froze as she gently stroked him, rubbing the head of his penis against her mound. Feeling she wanted more he slid one of his hands down her back, gliding between the firm cheeks of her butt.

年轻人退后一步，凝视着阿苏卡，激情和兴奋仍在他的脑海和身体中涌动。他觉得这次比前一晚更胜一筹。她的身体因快感和淋浴的热气而呈现出玫瑰色。当他们站在那里喘息时，他双臂环抱住她湿漉漉的身体；她的乳房摩擦着他的胸膛，让红发女孩发出轻微的呻吟。当她温柔地抚摸他，用他的阴茎头轻触她的阴部时，他僵住了。感觉到她想要更多，他的一只手滑过她的背部，滑入她紧实的臀部之间。

“No, Shinji.”

“But…”

“I said no,” she replied firmly before smirking at his expression. “You’ve already made enough of a mess today.”

“我说了不行，”她坚定地回答，然后朝他的表情微微一笑。“你今天已经够乱的了。”

The young man glanced down between them to see her fingers wiping at her legs. He blushed, realizing his semen had landed on her thigh. Kneeling down, he grabbed the wash cloth, which had landed behind them. With careful movements he wiped off her pristine body. His breath caught in his throat when she shifted, giving him a view of the treasure between her legs. Asuka gave him a smile when he looked up.

年轻人低头看向他们之间，发现她的手指正在擦拭腿上的痕迹。他脸红了，意识到自己的精液溅到了她的大腿上。他跪下来，抓起落在他们身后的毛巾，小心翼翼地擦去她身上那片纯净。当她移动身体，让他瞥见她双腿间的宝藏时，他的呼吸一窒。当他抬头时，明日香对他露出了微笑。

“Do you regret it?” “你后悔吗？”

Shinji stopped rubbing Asuka’s shoulders at her question, embracing her when she looked back at him. The sunlight flooded the room and sounds of the city could be heard through the open balcony doors. His memory of their recent activities was fresh in his mind and he knew it wasn’t going to fade soon. Still she had asked a very important question.

听到她的问题，真嗣停止了给明日香揉肩，当她回头看他时，他拥抱着她。阳光洒满了房间，城市的声音透过敞开的阳台门传来。他对他们最近的活动记忆犹新，知道这不会很快消退。尽管如此，她还是问了一个非常重要的问题。

“A little,” he admitted. “But not enough to leave you or get depressed over it.” The boy rested his chin on her shoulder as she leaned back. “Still I think it was good it happened.”

“有一点，”他承认道，“但不足以让我离开你或因此抑郁。”男孩将下巴搁在她肩上，她向后靠去。“不过，我认为发生这件事是好的。”

She gripped his arms tighter. “What do you mean by that?”

她更紧地抓住他的手臂。“你这么说是什么意思？”

“Well instead of letting our frustrations keep building to the point where we’d break our promise, we blew off a little steam.”

“与其让我们的挫败感不断累积到违背承诺的地步，不如释放一些压力。”

“A little!?” The girl turned bright red at his statement.

“一点点！？”女孩听到他的话，脸涨得通红。

“Do you regret it, Asuka?” he asked quietly, worried at her answer.

“你后悔了吗，明日香？”他轻声问道，担心她的回答。

She shook her head. “No. I want to say I regretted it, but I can’t.” The girl sniffled. “I can’t because…”

她摇了摇头。“不，我想说我后悔了，但我不能。”女孩抽泣着说，“我不能，因为……”

The young man crossed to her front in time to see a tear escape her closed eyes. She was trembling and biting her lower lip, looking completely vulnerable. Yet as he was about to touch the girl, her eyes opened.

年轻人及时走到她面前，看到一滴泪从她紧闭的眼中溢出。她颤抖着，咬着下唇，显得无比脆弱。然而，就在他即将触碰女孩时，她的眼睛睁开了。

“Because I love you too much.”

“因为我太爱你了。”

“Asuka?” He didn’t know what else to say at her admission.

“明日香？” 面对她的坦白，他不知该说什么好。

“I love you too much to regret what we did.” She wiped at her tears. “Damn it! If I regretted it that’d mean that this last year has been a lie. I’d be telling myself that my life since waking up has been fake.” The teen shook her head. “And I don’t want that.”

“我太爱你了，以至于无法后悔我们所做的一切。”她擦了擦眼泪。“该死！如果我后悔了，那就意味着这一年来都是谎言。我等于在告诉自己，自从醒来后我的生活都是假的。”少女摇了摇头。“而我不想那样。”

Shinji stared at his girlfriend as she cried, reaching out to grab her, pulling her close. She kept sniffling as she rested against him, her face pressed against his neck. But for all her crying and talking about the night before, all he had heard was that she loved him and that was all that mattered.

真嗣凝视着哭泣的女友，伸手将她拉近，紧紧抱住。她依偎在他怀里，脸贴着他的脖子，不停地抽泣。尽管她一直在哭诉前一晚的事，但他听到的只有她爱他，而这才是最重要的。

“I’m pathetic, aren’t I, Shinji?” she asked, quietly.

“我真没用，对吧，真嗣？”她轻声问道。

“No, you’re not.” “不，你不是。”

Asuka pulled away, looking into his eyes. “Yes, I am. It took me over a year to tell you that I love you. A whole stupid year! And only after we did something intimate.” She was trembling now. “If that isn’t pathetic, than I don’t know what…”

明日香退开一步，凝视着他的眼睛。“是的，我是。我花了超过一年的时间才告诉你我爱你。整整愚蠢的一年！而且是在我们有了亲密接触之后。”她现在颤抖着。“如果这还不算可悲，那我就不知道什么才算……”

Shinji cut off her protests, kissing her, hard. “The thing that matters is you finally admitted it, not just to me but to yourself,” he told her after they were done. “And I would love you even if you never told me.”

真嗣打断了她的抗议，用力吻了她。“重要的是你终于承认了，不仅是对我，也是对你自己，”他们在结束后他告诉她。“即使你从未告诉我，我也会爱你。”

“Stop lying, Shinji. I can tell you were worried I’d never tell you.”

“别撒谎了，真嗣。我知道你担心我永远不会告诉你。”

“Okay, so I was,” he admitted, backing away. “Still it wouldn’t change how I feel about you.” The young man looked at the room and sighed wistfully. “We better get going. Misato’s probably read over the preliminary report from Section 2 already. If we don’t get moving she’s not going to have any fingers left.”

“好吧，我承认我是担心过，”他边说边后退。“但这不会改变我对你的感情。”年轻人环顾房间，惆怅地叹了口气。“我们最好快点走。美里大概已经看完了第二课的初步报告。如果我们不快点，她可能连手指都要咬没了。”

“Yeah,” Asuka replied, moving to the door, stopping before she opened it. “Just a minute.”

“嗯，”明日香回答道，走向门口，在开门前停了下来。“稍等一下。”

Shinji watched as she dug a box out of her purse, blushing when she showed it to him. Opening the container, she removed one of the condoms, ripping open the wrapping. He stood, puzzled as she unrolled it before handing it to him. Holding it, he looked between the condom and Asuka.

真嗣看着她从包里翻出一个盒子，当她向他展示时，脸颊泛起了红晕。她打开盒子，取出一个避孕套，撕开包装。他站在那里，一脸困惑地看着她将避孕套展开，然后递给他。他拿着避孕套，目光在避孕套和明日香之间来回游移。

“Well go on, spit in it. And make sure you get a lot or no one will be fooled,” she commanded, opening another package.

“快点，往里面吐口水。一定要多吐点，不然没人会被骗的，”她命令道，同时又打开了一个包装。

Shrugging his shoulders, the man got to work in generating a large quantity of saliva. When he was on the verge of swallowing he grabbed the condom. Careful not to touch his lips to it, he let a steady stream of saliva flow into the prophylactic. He looked at Asuka to see that she was doing the same on the other condom, but with a blank face. When they were done she went back to the bed, stretched out on it and dropped the condoms at arms-length over the side.

男子耸了耸肩，开始努力分泌大量唾液。当他快要吞咽时，他抓住了避孕套。小心翼翼地不让嘴唇触碰到它，他让一股稳定的唾液流进避孕套中。他看向明日香，发现她也在另一个避孕套上做着同样的事情，但面无表情。完成后，她回到床上，伸展开来，将避孕套放在手臂长度外的床边。

Standing up, she scattered the rest of the condoms on the floor, tossing the box next to the garbage can. The girl knew that at least one person on the cleaning crew would be from NERV and once they made their report Misato would go crazy. When she returned to his side, the teen was smiling and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.

她站起身，将剩下的避孕套撒了一地，把盒子扔到垃圾桶旁边。女孩知道清洁队至少有一人来自 NERV，一旦他们报告上去，美里肯定会抓狂。回到他身边时，少女微笑着，在他脸颊上轻吻了一下。

“You know it’s not nice to play with Misato’s mind like that,” he commented.

“你知道这样捉弄美里的心思不太好吧，”他评论道。

“Are you going to tell her?” she asked.

“你要告诉她吗？”她问道。

“Nope.”

February 2020

“That jerk!”

Misato sighed, looking up from the television to see Asuka storming down the hall. The teen’s tone of voice and her words were enough to warn the older woman that any chance of a night of relaxation was gone. She had finally gotten a weekend off, though Hyuga was gone for a class and all she had had planned was to do some light drinking, eating take-out and watching movies. What she had not planned on was for Shinji to upset Asuka in some minor way. Now she was going to pay for that oversight as the teen sat down next to her with a huff.

惣流叹了口气，从电视上抬起头，看到明日香怒气冲冲地从走廊走来。少女的语气和话语足以警告这位年长女性，今晚的放松时光已经泡汤了。她好不容易有个周末休假，本打算喝点小酒，吃些外卖，看看电影。但她没料到，真嗣会以某种小方式惹恼明日香。现在，她将为这一疏忽付出代价，因为少女气呼呼地坐在了她旁边。

“Asuka, what’s…” “明日香，这是…”

“I can’t believe the nerve of that guy. He’s gone for two weeks in December to study for entrance exams.” The girl threw up her arms. “Then he locks himself in his room until he’s done taking the stupid tests.”

“真不敢相信那家伙的胆量。他十二月请了两周假去准备入学考试。”女孩挥舞着双手说，“然后他就把自己关在房间里，直到考完那些愚蠢的考试。”

“They’re not stupid,” Misato said quietly. “He needs to make sure that he scores…

“他们并不傻，” 美里轻声说，“他需要确保自己得分……”

“Don’t give me that,” the girl growled. “The idiot scored in the top ten on the first battery. Not in the top ten percent of the test takers, but in the top ten students. He’s already guaranteed himself a slot at Kyoto University. The same with Tokyo-2 University.”

“别跟我说这些，”女孩咆哮道，“那个笨蛋在第一轮测试中就进入了前十名。不是前百分之十，而是前十名学生。他已经被京都大学录取了。东京二大学也是一样。”

The older woman closed her eyes, counting to ten before opening them. “Shinji just wants to make sure he lives up to your expectations.” She saw that was the wrong thing to say. “Just wait…”

年长的女士闭上眼睛，数到十才睁开。“真嗣只是想确保他能满足你的期望。”她意识到这话不妥。“等等看吧……”

“My expectations?” The redhead repeated. “My expectations of him are real simple. As long as he does his best I don’t care what he is.”

“我的期望？”红发女子重复道，“我对他的期望很简单。只要他尽了全力，我不在乎他是谁。”

“To him, it’s not that simple. He wants to be someone that others can look up to.” Misato took a sip from her can of beer. “So have you put in your applications?”

“对他来说，这并不简单。他希望成为别人可以仰望的人。” 葛城美里喝了一口啤酒，“那么，你提交申请了吗？”

The girl nodded. “Already sent in and I’ve been accepted at three colleges. Just have to wait…” She trailed off, “Guess I have been putting pressure on him.”

女孩点了点头。“已经提交了申请，有三所大学录取了我。只需等待……”她话音渐弱，“看来我确实给他施加了压力。”

“Yep,” agreed Misato.

“Still it doesn’t give him the right to push me away.” Asuka paused, standing. “Only one way to take care of that.”

“即便如此，他也没有权利把我推开。”飞鸟停顿了一下，站起身来。“只有一种方法可以解决这个问题。”

The older woman turned to watch the redhead walk away from the couch and down the hall. The sound of a door being forcefully opened soon reached her as she saw the teen disappear into Shinji’s room. A surprised squawk came from the boy and a quiet reply from the girl. Their conversation went on for a few minutes before Asuka reappeared dragging a reluctant Shinji behind her. She kept ignoring his protests as she stopped at the couch.

那位年长的女士转头望去，只见红发少女从沙发旁走向走廊。不久，她听到门被用力打开的声音，随即看到那名少年消失在真嗣的房间里。男孩发出一声惊讶的叫声，女孩则轻声回应。他们的对话持续了几分钟后，明日香再次出现，拖着不情愿的真嗣跟在后面。她对真嗣的抗议置若罔闻，一直把他拉到沙发前。

“Idiot boy and I will be gone for awhile so don’t worry.” With that the pair turned and walked to the door. Well one walked and other was dragged.

“这个笨蛋男孩和我一会儿就出去，不用担心。”说完，两人转身向门口走去。确切地说，是一个人走，另一个是被拖着。

Misato sighed as the door closed behind the teens. “I got my peace and quiet.”

美里叹了口气，随着门在少年们身后关上。“我终于得到了片刻的宁静。”

“Asuka, what are you doing,” protested Shinji as they left the apartment building. “I need to…”

“明日香，你在做什么？” 真嗣抗议道，他们正离开公寓大楼。“我需要……”

The boy’s eyes flew open and he coughed when the woman slammed him against the side of the building. He started to protest until he saw the look in her eyes. She grabbed his chin and held the young man in place when he tried to turn his head. Leaning closer until their noses touched, the redhead didn’t say anything, only frowning. They stayed like that for a few seconds until Asuka smiled faintly.

男孩的眼睛猛地睁开，当女人将他猛撞到建筑物一侧时，他咳嗽起来。他本想抗议，但看到她眼中的神情后便止住了。她抓住他的下巴，当他试图转头时，她紧紧固定住他。她倾身靠近，直到他们的鼻子相触，红发女子一言不发，只是皱着眉头。他们就这样僵持了几秒钟，直到明日香微微一笑。

“Listen. Studying is fine, especially for something as important as college but there is a limit. Burning yourself out isn’t going to do you any good,” she told him calmly. “Your test is in two days and if you don’t know it by now you’re never going to know it, so relax.” The girl pulled on his arm, smiling. “You don’t have to get all tense now.”

“听着，学习是好事，尤其是对于像大学这样重要的事情，但也要有个限度。把自己累垮了对你是没有好处的，”她平静地对他说。“你的考试就在两天后，如果现在还不懂，那你永远也不会懂了，所以放松点。”女孩拉了拉他的胳膊，微笑着说：“你现在不必这么紧张。”

The young man slid his hand down to hers, intertwining their fingers. “I guess you’re right.”

年轻人将手滑向她的手，手指交缠在一起。“我想你说得对。”

“I’m always right, Shinji,” the redhead said, smirking.

“我总是对的，真嗣，”红发女子说着，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。

“Still this is a big decision for me.”

“对我来说，这仍然是一个重大的决定。”

The teens exited the parking lot of the apartment complex and headed out into the hills behind it. Ten minutes later they had reached the top of the hill and sat facing away from the city. They had discovered that watching the city was neither fun nor interesting so they had started staring out into the countryside. It was a clear moonless evening and the teens could see for miles, the various houses standing out in the distance. Shinji sat there quietly, his arms wrapped around his legs, staring blankly into the distance. He jumped when Asuka put an arm around him.

少年们离开了公寓楼的停车场，向着后面的山丘进发。十分钟后，他们到达了山顶，背对着城市坐下。他们发现，观看城市既不有趣也不吸引人，于是开始凝视着乡村。这是一个晴朗无月的夜晚，少年们能望见数英里之外，远处的各种房屋在夜色中格外显眼。真嗣静静地坐在那里，双臂环抱着双腿，目光空洞地望向远方。当明日香伸手搭在他肩上时，他吓了一跳。

“Come on, don’t sulk. We haven’t talked or done anything together lately.”

“别这样，别生气了。我们最近都没有好好谈过或一起做过什么。”

“I know. It’s just that this is very important,” he said, lying on his back, feeling Asuka copying him.

“我知道。只是这件事非常重要，”他躺在地上说，感觉到明日香在模仿他。

“I agree choosing a college is a significant decision but what makes Kyoto University so important?”

“我同意选择大学是一个重要的决定，但京都大学为何如此重要呢？”

Shinji sat up, looking off in the distance. “My mother and father went there. You could say I want to follow in their footsteps.”

真嗣坐起身来，望向远方。“我的父母曾在那里就读。可以说，我想追随他们的脚步。”

“I hope not!” exclaimed Asuka. “Your mother’s dead and your father’s in jail. I don’t want you to become like them.” She calmed down at his expression. “What about Tokyo-2?”

“希望不是这样！”明日香大声说道。“你母亲已经去世，你父亲在监狱里。我不想你变得像他们一样。”看到他的表情，她平静了下来。“那东京二号呢？”

“Misato.”

“Oh.”

The silence lasted a few minutes as the young adults sat there, lost in thought. Shinji glanced at Asuka who had a distant look on her face and moved closer. He frowned when she flinched at his touch after he put an arm around her. The scowl disappeared when she smiled and rested a hand on his leg.

沉默持续了几分钟，年轻人们坐在那里，陷入了沉思。真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，她脸上带着遥远的神情，于是他挪近了一些。当他伸手搂住她时，她因触碰而退缩，他皱起了眉头。但当她微笑着将手放在他的腿上时，他的皱眉消失了。

“What about you?” he inquired. “Did you go to the same school as your mother or father.”

“你呢？”他问道，“你是和你母亲还是父亲上同一所学校？”

“No.” She shook her head angrily. “I hated both of them back then. There was no way I’d go the same school as them. And I made sure my degree was different.”

“不。”她愤怒地摇了摇头。“我当时讨厌他们俩。我绝不会和他们上同一所学校。我还特意选了不同的专业。”

The redhead broke from Shinji’s embrace, standing and walking down the hill a short distance. Her hair blew in the light breeze while she stared out into the countryside. Even the sound of footsteps coming closer didn’t make her look back at her companion. When he stopped beside her, the woman didn’t look, only moving her hand to grip his gently. At his sigh, she glanced over at him to see a worried look on his face.

红发女子挣脱了真嗣的拥抱，站起身来，向山坡下走了几步。她的头发在微风中飘扬，她凝视着乡野。即使听到脚步声逐渐靠近，她也没有回头看向同伴。当他停在她身边时，女子并未转头，只是移动手轻轻握住他的手。听到他的叹息，她瞥了他一眼，看到他脸上满是担忧。

“What’s wrong, Asuka?” “怎么了，明日香？”

“Nothing.”

“Something’s on your mind,” he stated to her blunt reply.

“你心里有事，”他对她直率的回答说道。

“It’s nothing important, just thinking.”

“没什么重要的，只是随便想想。”

Shinji smiled. “About what?”

真嗣微笑着问：“想什么呢？”

“The past, the future. How I hated my childhood and how much I wanted to become an adult.” She gripped his hand tighter. “In a couple months we’ll be adults in the eyes of the law, with adult responsibilities. We’ll soon have to make some mature decisions that’ll affect us the rest of our lives.”

“过去，未来。我多么憎恨我的童年，又多么渴望长大成人。”她紧紧握住他的手。“再过几个月，在法律眼中我们就是成年人了，将承担成人的责任。我们很快就得做出一些会影响我们余生的成熟决定。”

“We’ll be okay.” He hugged her tightly. “We always make the right decisions.”

“我们会没事的。”他紧紧拥抱她。“我们总是能做出正确的决定。”

Late October 2020

“Can you get that, Shinji?”

“你能去拿一下吗，真嗣？”

The young man stopped typing and looked up from the computer to stare at Asuka. She was stretched out on the floor watching television and eating a bag of potato chips. He didn’t flinch as the redhead sat up, annoyed when the doorbell rang again, and glared at him. Shinji was determined not to give into her commands this time; the paper he was writing was top priority. Slowly, he shook his head when she gave him a cute pout and crossed her arms.

年轻人停止了打字，从电脑前抬起头来，盯着明日香。她正躺在地板上，边看电视边吃着一袋薯片。当红发女孩坐起身来，因为门铃再次响起而显得不耐烦，并瞪着他时，他并没有退缩。这次，真嗣决心不屈服于她的命令；他正在写的论文是首要任务。当她撅起嘴，双手交叉时，他缓缓地摇了摇头。

“I’m busy,” he told her calmly.

“And I’m not?” She stood up and advanced on him. “Do I have to remind you I was at the lab all day? Or how I have to grade papers for a couple of professors.”

“难道我不是吗？”她站起来，向他逼近。“需要我提醒你我一整天都在实验室吗？或者我得为几位教授批改论文。”

“No, you don’t have to remind me but…” He grinned slyly. “Since you’re up you might as well get the door.”

“不，你不需要提醒我，但是……”他狡黠地笑了。“既然你已经站起来了，不妨去开下门。”

“Idiot,” growled Asuka. “白痴，”明日香低吼道。

The redhead turned from her roommate and strode to the door, her fists clenched. She couldn’t believe she had fallen into such an easy trap. Glancing over her shoulder, the woman saw Shinji staring at her with desire, feeling the same. They both had been too busy in the last months to do anything or even plan a special trip. She muttered under breath as the doorbell rang once again. Whoever had interrupted her leisure time was surely going to pay. Wrenching open the door, she prepared to chew out the offender.

红发女子转身离开室友，大步走向门口，拳头紧握。她不敢相信自己竟落入如此简单的陷阱。回头一瞥，只见女人看到真嗣正用渴望的眼神盯着她，感受相同。过去几个月里，他们都忙得无暇他顾，甚至没时间计划一次特别的旅行。她低声咒骂着，门铃再次响起。无论谁打断了她的闲暇时光，都必将付出代价。猛地打开门，她准备好好训斥那个冒犯者。

“What the hell do you…” Her rant stopped when she saw who it was. “Oh, it’s you two.”

“你到底想干……”当她看清来人时，怒斥戛然而止。“哦，是你们俩啊。”

“Such a warm welcome, Asuka,” a woman said before grabbing the redhead.

“多么热情的欢迎啊，明日香，”一位女士说着，随即抓住了红发女孩。

“Ahh, let go, Misato.” “啊，放开我，美里。”

The young woman struggled out of the hug her former roommate had wrapped her in, pointing to the man at the computer. Standing off to the side, she watched with smile when Shinji was smothered in a bigger hug. She shared a knowing look with Hyuga as he entered the apartment, closing the door behind him. As they approached the pair, the redhead felt a twinge of jealously at how Misato was acting with her boyfriend. With a frown she pushed herself between them, getting a laugh from the older woman.

年轻女子从昔日室友的拥抱中挣脱出来，指向电脑前的男子。她站在一旁，微笑着看着真嗣被一个更大的拥抱淹没。当日向走进公寓并关上门时，她与他交换了一个心照不宣的眼神。当他们走近那对情侣时，红发女子感到一丝嫉妒，因为美里对她男友的举动。她皱着眉头挤到两人中间，引得年长女子一阵大笑。

“I’m not going to steal him.”

“我不会抢走他的。”

“Like I’d let you take him.” The redhead brightened a little. “So what’s with the visit? You could’ve called so we’d run to the store.”

“我怎么可能让你带走他。”红发女子稍稍振作了一些。“那么这次来访有什么事？你本可以打个电话，我们好去商店。”

NERV’s Sub-Commander grinned. “That’s why it’s called a surprise visit. What fun would it be if you knew we were coming?”

NERV 的副司令笑着说：“这就是为什么称之为惊喜访问。如果你们事先知道我们要来，那还有什么乐趣呢？”

Hyuga chuckled. “Don’t worry we brought dinner.” He looked at the younger man. “You do have a grill, don’t you?”

日向轻笑道：“别担心，我们带了晚餐来。”他看向那位年轻人。“你有烧烤架吧？”

Shinji nodded and saved his paper before shutting the computer down and heading to the dining room. The other three adults followed him, crowding into the small room. Misato quickly designated certain tasks for everyone there, shooing the males out onto the balcony while she guided Asuka to the kitchen. The kitchen filled with the sounds of food being prepared, but empty of conversation.

真嗣点头保存了论文，然后关闭电脑，走向餐厅。其他三位成年人跟随其后，挤进了狭小的房间。美里迅速为在场的每个人分配了任务，将男性们赶到了阳台上，同时引导明日香进入厨房。厨房里充满了食物准备的声音，却缺少了交谈。

“So have you and Shinji done it yet?” Misato asked after minutes of silence. “I remember the looks you two would give each other before you moved out.”

“那么，你和真嗣已经做了吗？”美里在几分钟的沉默后问道。“我记得你们俩搬出去之前看对方的眼神。”

“Misato!” The redhead turned, red in the face. “How could you ask such a thing?”

“美里！”红发女子转过身来，满脸通红。“你怎么能问出这种问题？”

“What? I’m just inquiring into the well being of two NERV officers.” She smiled. “After all it is important you two have a healthy relationship, especially when sex is involved.”

“什么？我只是关心一下两位 NERV 官员的安康。”她微笑着说，“毕竟，你们俩保持健康的关系很重要，尤其是当涉及到性的时候。”

“Still you just don’t show up for a visit and bring up a subject like that,” Asuka stated. “Have you no sense of decency?”

“但你也不能就这样突然来访，还提起这种话题，”明日香说道，“你就没有一点体面吗？”

“Of course I do, but…”

“当然，我会的，但是……”

“It’s none of your business,” growled the redhead. “We’ve been too busy with school, moving, and work.”

“这不关你的事，”红头发的人咆哮道。“我们一直忙于学校、搬家和工作。”

“Well I got my answer. Besides it’s not my fault you both bought new cars and wanted to live in an apartment instead of the dorms.” She paused lifting the lid on the soup. “If you had done what I asked, you’d have plenty of free-time.”

“好吧，我得到答案了。再说，你们俩买了新车，想住公寓而不是宿舍，这也不是我的错。”她停顿了一下，揭开汤锅的盖子。“如果你们按我说的做，你们会有很多空闲时间。”

“Is that what this visit is about? Whether we’ve had sex yet?” Asuka frowned at the thought. “You could have just called and saved yourself a trip.

“这次来访就是为了问我们是否已经发生关系吗？”明日香对这个想法皱起了眉头。“你本可以打个电话，省得自己跑一趟。”

“I’ve missed the two of you; the apartment seems too empty now. But…” The violet haired woman turned from the stove. “No. We came to tell you some news and give you two something.” She moved next to Asuka. “So is it only your lack of free-time that has stopped you from going all the way, or something else?” She grinned before whispering. “Still scared?”

“我好想念你们俩；现在公寓显得太空荡了。但是……”紫发女子从炉子旁转过身来。“不。我们来是要告诉你一些消息，并给你们俩带点东西。”她走到明日香旁边。“所以，是你们没有空闲时间才没走到那一步，还是别的什么原因？”她窃笑后低声说：“还是害怕吗？”

“You’re impossible! No, I’m not scared anymore, Misato!” snapped Asuka, before blushing. “I’m finally ready, and I know he’s ready. But it has to be…” The redhead shook her head slightly. “Why am I even trying to explain anything, you wouldn’t understand what this means to us.”

“你真是不可理喻！不，我不再害怕了，美里！”明日香急忙反驳，随后脸红。“我终于准备好了，我知道他也准备好了。但必须得是……”红发少女轻轻摇头。“我干嘛还费劲解释，你不会明白这对我们意味着什么。”

“I think I do.” The older woman paused. “You know you could just rent the same suite you did for after the dance?”

“我想我是的。”年长的女士停顿了一下。“你知道你可以租用舞会后住过的那个套房吗？”

“No. That was something completely different.” The younger woman glared at Misato. “Which reminds me. I never thanked you for that special physical the next day.”

“不，那完全是两码事。”年轻女士瞪了 Misato 一眼。“这让我想起，我还没感谢你第二天安排的那次特殊体检呢。”

“You deserved it after the stunt you two pulled.” The woman shook a finger at the redhead before grabbing her again. “I just want what’s best for you two.”

“你们俩搞的那一出，这是你们应得的。”女人对着红发女孩摇了摇手指，然后再次抓住她。“我只是希望你们俩能好。”

“I know.” Asuka felt herself blush as she broke from the embrace. “Still you don’t have to hug me so much?” She looked at Misato, who was failing to hide a grin. “So you going to tell me the real reason you’re here?”

“我知道。”明日香感到自己脸红了，她从拥抱中挣脱出来。“不过，你也不用这么频繁地抱我吧？”她看着美里，后者正努力掩饰着笑意。“所以，你打算告诉我你来这里的真正原因了吗？”

“Nope.” The woman’s smile grew wider.

“不。”女人的笑容更灿烂了。

“You have something planned, don’t you?”

“你有什么计划，对吧？”

The older woman turned around, laughing. “I’m not telling you anything, Asuka.”

那位年长的女士转过身来，笑着说：“我不会告诉你任何事的，明日香。”

“You’re no fun,” pouted the redhead.

“你真没趣，”红发女孩噘嘴说道。

Shinji leaned against the railing of the balcony, staring out across the brightly lit city. He remembered how hard it had been to fall asleep when they first moved into the apartment. The shades hadn’t been able to block all of the light, so their rooms never completely got dark. It had been only one of many adjustments they had to make in moving into a city instead of living on the outskirts of one. Misato’s visit had reminded him how much he had enjoyed the quietness of her apartment. But that wasn’t the only thing forcing him out to balcony instead of sleeping next to Asuka.

真嗣倚靠在阳台的栏杆上，凝视着灯火辉煌的城市。他回忆起初搬进公寓时，入睡是多么困难。窗帘无法完全遮挡光线，因此他们的房间从未彻底变暗。这只是他们从郊区搬到城市所必须做出的众多调整之一。美里来访时，他才意识到自己多么怀念她公寓的宁静。但促使他来到阳台而不是睡在明日香身边的，并不只有这一点。

“Marriage. I can’t believe it,” he muttered to himself.

“结婚。我真不敢相信，”他自言自语道。

It had come as a shock when Hyuga had told them he was quitting NERV. The rumors and complaints had grown too much for the couple to perform their duties properly. The two loved each other and were not about to break it off; instead deciding retirement was the easiest solution. That bit of news had been enough to stun him and Asuka but it was only the beginning. Soon after telling them he was quitting, Misato had broken the news of their engagement by showing off her ring. That had resulted in the two younger adults being shocked speechless. They had never thought their guardian would get married. In fact they had stayed up late talking about it and their own plans for the future, but had reached no conclusion.

当日向告诉他们他要退出 NERV 时，这消息令人震惊。流言蜚语和抱怨已经多到让这对夫妇无法正常履行职责。两人深爱着对方，并不打算分手；相反，他们认为退休是最简单的解决办法。这个消息足以让真嗣和明日香目瞪口呆，但这只是开始。在告诉他们自己要退出后不久，美里宣布了他们的订婚消息，并展示了她的戒指。这让两个年轻人震惊得说不出话来。他们从未想过他们的监护人会结婚。事实上，他们熬夜讨论了这件事以及他们自己的未来计划，但并未得出结论。

“Shouldn’t you be in bed?”

“你不是应该在床上吗？”

Shinji jumped at the quiet voice next to his ear just before Asuka gave him a quick hug. She leaned forward grinning, flicking his nose with a finger. The redhead had woken up, missing the heat of the young man sleeping next to her, and saw him standing at the balcony. Whatever he had been thinking about must have been important because he never realized she was behind him. But that wasn’t what was making her grin; it was the way he was looking at her.

真嗣被耳边轻柔的声音吓了一跳，紧接着明日香迅速拥抱了他一下。她倾身向前，咧嘴笑着，用手指轻弹他的鼻子。红发女孩醒来后，因为身边少了那个年轻人的体温而感到失落，看到他正站在阳台上。他思考的事情一定很重要，因为他完全没有意识到她就在他身后。但这并不是让她咧嘴笑的原因；而是他看她的方式。

“What are you staring at?” she asked.

“你在看什么？”她问道。

“Just you,” he admitted. “I do like your other attire better.”

“就看你，”他承认道，“我确实更喜欢你其他的装扮。”

Though she was still beautiful dressed in red boxers and a blue halter-top, he liked her better in her lingerie. He found his eyes roaming over the redhead, taking in her beauty. The light made her creamy skin even more beautiful, while her hair glowed in the lights of the city. The woman grinned wider at the admission and his look. Leaning forward, she kissed him hard on the lips, grinning to herself. All the looks they received when they hugged and kissed in public came back to her, amusing the redhead. She didn’t care if others thought that kissing or hugging was improper in public, she obeyed only her own rules. Breaking the kiss, she pressed herself against, shivering at the cold on her back.

尽管她穿着红色短裤和蓝色露背上衣依然美丽动人，但他更喜欢她穿内衣的样子。他的目光不由自主地游走在那位红发女子身上，欣赏着她的美貌。灯光让她的奶油色肌肤更显迷人，而她的头发在城市灯光下熠熠生辉。女子听到他的赞美，看到他的眼神，笑得更开了。她倾身向前，用力吻上他的唇，心中窃喜。他们在大庭广众之下拥抱亲吻时所受到的目光，此刻都涌上她的心头，逗得这位红发女子乐不可支。她不在乎别人是否认为在公共场合亲吻或拥抱不妥，她只遵循自己的规则。结束这个吻后，她紧贴着他，因背上的寒意而微微颤抖。

“Don’t worry, I’ll go back to my usual attire when we go on the trip.” She glanced back, grinning. “Remember what I said at the dance.”

“别担心，我们旅行时我会换回平常的装束。”她回头一笑，“记得我在舞会上说的话。”

“I remember,” he said blushing. “Speaking of the trip…”

“我记得，”他脸红着说，“说到旅行……”

“Don’t worry,” she told him. “We’ll enjoy ourselves.”

“别担心，”她对他说，“我们会玩得很开心的。”

The engagement and retirement weren’t the only surprises the older couple had for Asuka and Shinji. After the shock had worn off and they were sitting around talking about the news, Misato had pulled out a large manila envelope and handed it to Asuka. When the redhead had opened the packet she had sat there stunned at what they had been given. A paid ten-day trip to Vienna, right after finals were over. The younger couple had asked what the occasion was but were only told they deserved a vacation and what better place than Europe. Asuka had realized then what Misato had been smiling about earlier in the kitchen.

订婚与退休并非这对年长夫妇给明日香和真嗣的唯一惊喜。震惊过后，当他们坐在一起谈论这个消息时，美里拿出一个大号牛皮纸信封递给明日香。当红发少女打开信封时，她坐在那里惊呆了，原来他们收到了一份礼物——期末考试结束后的一趟为期十天的维也纳之旅。这对年轻情侣询问缘由，却只被告知他们应得一次度假，而欧洲无疑是最佳选择。那时，明日香才明白之前在厨房里美里为何面带微笑。

“I’m just wondering why they spent that much money on us,” Shinji said. “It’s like she wants to get rid of us.”

“我只是想知道他们为什么在我们身上花这么多钱，”真嗣说，“好像她想摆脱我们似的。”

“Don’t be stupid. Misato still loves us. It’s probably her way of saying we deserve to get away from everything for once,” the redhead said, glancing over her shoulder. “Unless you’re saying you don’t want to spend ten days alone with me in a foreign country.”

“别犯傻了。Misato 依然爱着我们。这大概只是她表达我们值得暂时逃离一切的方式，”红发女子说着，回头瞥了一眼。“除非你是在说，你不想和我单独在异国他乡共度十天。”

The man bent his head, kissing Asuka. “Of course I do. It’s just that…” He paused for a moment. “Never mind. I’m sure we’ll find ways to entertain ourselves.”

男子低下头，吻了吻 Asuka。“我当然愿意。只是……”他顿了一下。“算了，我们肯定能找到自娱自乐的方法。”

“You’re right about that, Shinji,” whispered the redhead, smiling to herself.

“你说的没错，真嗣，”红发女孩低声说道，脸上带着微笑。

December 2020

“I’m done.”

Shinji looked up from his meal to see Asuka setting down her fork and pushing her plate away. He frowned, seeing she had barely touched the food, normally she’d eat twice as much as he would. But tonight she had eaten a salad and taken a small portion of the main course. She had also held herself to a single glass of wine, seeming to savor the taste with each sip. To say it was unusual was true but the man had seen her do many things she normally didn’t do on their trip so far.

真嗣从餐盘中抬头，看见明日香放下叉子，推开了自己的盘子。他皱起眉头，注意到她几乎没怎么吃东西，通常她会吃下他两倍的食物。但今晚，她只吃了一份沙拉，主菜也只取了少量。她还限制自己只喝了一杯葡萄酒，每一口都似乎在细细品味。说这很反常是没错，但到目前为止的旅行中，他已经见过她做了许多平时不会做的事。

“Is something wrong?” “有什么不对劲吗？”

The quiet voice with a touch of worry broke him out of his introspection and he looked up. His shook his head slightly as he looked at the gorgeous woman in front of him. When she had come out of the bedroom earlier he had thought only an angel could match her beauty. That thought was again going through his mind as she stood behind her chair, hands crossed on the top of it as she looked at him. Her shiny auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders while blue eyes twinkled as she smiled. The modest white dress matched her creamy skin perfectly and presented an image of innocence. He frowned, remembering she had asked a question.

那带着一丝忧虑的轻声细语将他从沉思中唤醒，他抬头望去。他轻轻摇了摇头，目光落在眼前这位美丽的女子身上。早先她从卧室走出来时，他觉得只有天使才能与她的美貌相媲美。此刻，这个念头再次掠过他的脑海，她站在椅子后面，双手交叉放在椅背上，注视着他。她那闪亮的赤褐色长发披散在肩上，蓝色的眼睛因微笑而闪烁。朴素的白色裙子与她奶油般的肌肤完美相衬，呈现出一种纯洁无瑕的形象。他皱起眉头，想起她刚才问了一个问题。

“Just you’ve barely touched your food.”

“你几乎没怎么动过你的食物。”

The redhead chewed on her bottom lip, her fingers dancing. “I…I just have something on my mind.” She smiled briefly. “It’s nothing to get worried over.”

红发女子咬着下唇，手指轻舞。“我……我只是心里有事。”她短暂地笑了笑。“没什么好担心的。”

With those words she turned around, slowly striding over to the bedroom door. Asuka could feel Shinji’s eyes on her backside and smiled to herself, putting a little more movement into her walk. Still her hands were busy in front of her body, away from his view. The redhead didn’t like the butterflies in her stomach but knew there was no way to get rid of them. Well there was one way but she wasn’t going to use it. Pausing in front of the door, she looked over her shoulder, smiling mischievously.

说完这些话，她转过身，缓缓走向卧室门。明日香能感觉到真嗣的目光落在她的后背上，她暗自微笑，故意在步态中加入更多摇曳。尽管如此，她的双手仍忙于身前，避开他的视线。红发女孩不喜欢胃里的蝴蝶，但也知道无法摆脱它们。虽然有一种方法，但她并不打算使用。在门前停下，她回头一瞥，狡黠地笑了。

“Don’t take too long coming to bed.”

“别让我等太久上床。”

Shinji watched her white clad body disappear into the room, leaving the door open behind her. Smiling to himself he stood and went over to the large French doors leading out to the balcony and looked at the scene in front of him. Snow capped mountains rose far into the night sky lit by the half moon climbing to its own zenith. A turn to the left showed Vienna far in the distance, sprawling out in all directions. The mountains displayed the beauty of nature, and also its might. The city was man’s attempt at copying the beauty of nature with its grand designs, and the bright lights. As he looked at the scene out the windows, he listened to the crackle of fire in the background.

真嗣看着她身着白衣的身影消失在房间里，留下门敞开着。他微笑着站起身，走向通往阳台的巨大法式门，凝望着眼前的景象。积雪覆盖的山峰高耸入夜空，半轮月亮正向着自己的天顶攀升。向左一转，维也纳远在视线之外，向四面八方蔓延。群山展现了自然的美丽，也彰显了它的力量。这座城市是人类试图模仿自然之美的宏伟设计，以及璀璨灯光的尝试。当他透过窗户凝视着这一幕时，耳边响起了火堆的噼啪声。

“Shinji, you coming to bed?”

“真嗣，你要来睡觉了吗？”

The man turned from the view, frowning when he heard Asuka call his name, not realizing how long he had been standing there. His feet made no sound as he crossed the thick rug to the open door leading to the bedroom. Taking a step into the large room, he started closing the door before remembering no one would disturb them. Looking at the door, he chuckled at his foolishness and took another step into the room he had been sharing with Asuka for the past four days. His laugh disappeared at the scene in front of him.

男子从窗景前转身，听到明日香呼唤他的名字时皱起了眉头，未曾察觉自己已伫立多久。他踏过厚实的地毯，脚步无声地走向通往卧室的敞开门。迈入宽敞的房间，他开始关门，却又想起无人会来打扰。望着门，他自嘲地笑了笑，再进一步踏入这四天来与明日香共处的房间。然而，眼前的景象让他的笑声戛然而止。

The room’s lights had been dimmed and moonlight shone through the large, arched windows, illuminating the room with a pale silver light. Yellow points flickered and danced from candles placed on each side of the large bed. Bouquets of flowers, bought that day, filled the room with their light scent. Yet all that was of no importance as he approached the side of the bed, his eyes fastened on the woman laying in the middle. The white negligee only accented the beauty of her stunning body, pale shoulders showed while her ample chest pressed against the fabric. More of her lovely skin was exposed, as long, slender legs lay bare on top of the silk sheets. Her illustrious auburn hair trailed down the woman’s back, a few strands resting on a smooth cheek. Blue eyes twinkled in the light when she patted the bed next to her.

房间的灯光已经调暗，月光透过高大的拱形窗户洒落，以苍白的银辉照亮了整个空间。大床两侧摆放的蜡烛闪烁着黄色光点，轻盈地舞动。当天购买的花束为房间增添了淡淡的香气。然而，这一切都不重要，因为他正走向床边，目光紧紧锁定在躺在中间的那位女士身上。白色的睡裙更衬托出她那令人惊艳的身躯，白皙的肩膀显露无遗，丰满的胸部紧贴着面料。她那修长纤细的双腿裸露在丝绸床单之上，更显迷人。她那光泽的赤褐色长发垂落在背上，几缕发丝轻抚着光滑的面颊。当她轻拍身旁的床铺时，蓝色的眼睛在光中闪烁着光芒。

“Asuka?” His voice held a hint of nervousness as he sat on the edge.

“明日香？”他坐在床沿，声音中带着一丝紧张。

“You know I won’t hurt you.” Her voice was soft, almost a whisper.

“你知道我不会伤害你。”她的声音柔和，几乎是在耳语。

Shinji swallowed when she sat up, the cloth riding up her hips. He nodded as her fingers traced lightly over his hand, barely touching his skin. Carefully, he slid onto the bed, laying on his side in front of her, waiting to see what she would do next. What Asuka did next wasn’t what he had been expecting. She pushed him flat before snuggling against him, her head resting on his chest. Both remained silent as her fingers traced over his chest, plucking at the buttons of his shirt, and he wrapped an arm around her slender body.

当她坐起来时，真嗣咽了咽口水，布料随着她的动作滑到臀部。她轻抚他的手，指尖几乎不触碰他的皮肤，他点头回应。小心翼翼地，他滑到床上，侧身躺在她面前，等待着看她下一步会做什么。明日香接下来的举动出乎他的意料。她将他推倒，然后依偎在他身边，头枕在他的胸膛上。两人都沉默着，她的手指在他胸前游走，轻扯着他衬衫的扣子，而他则用一只手臂环抱住她纤细的身体。

“I remember when I never wanted to get close to anyone,” she started minutes later. “You’ve been with me the longest, not counting mama.” Asuka smiled faintly. “Four years is a lot of memories. You’ve made me angry and sad at times. At other times you’ve made me feel worthless…shhh.” She placed a finger on his lips. “You also make me feel like the most important person in the world. But you’ve given me the thing that matters the most, your love.”

“我记得以前我从不愿与人亲近，”几分钟后她开口说道，“你陪伴我的时间最长，除了妈妈。”明日香微微一笑，“四年积累了许多回忆。你有时让我生气和难过，有时又让我觉得自己一文不值……嘘。”她将手指轻放在他的唇上，“你也让我感到自己是世界上最重要的人。但你给予我最重要的，是你的爱。”

Shinji tightened his hold on the redhead. “That’ll never change.”

真嗣紧了紧对红发女孩的拥抱，“这永远不会改变。”

“I know.” She lifted herself a little, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek, before returning to her former position. Asuka looked at him sadly. “And you still loved me after that incident.”

“我知道。”她稍稍起身，在他脸颊上轻吻一下，随即又回到原来的姿势。明日香悲伤地看着他。“那次事件后，你依然爱着我。”

“I already explained…”

“Be quiet, Shinji. I’m talking here.”

安静点，真嗣，我正在说话。

“Sorry.”

Asuka glared at him for a moment, then smiled. She lay against him soaking up his body heat, content to stay in the comfort he was providing. Yet she knew she would have to move soon to finish telling him what she wanted. And that was what was scary. The redhead didn’t know what his reaction would be. Fear was still in the back of her mind because of the importance of her proposal, and she was afraid he would misinterpret it. Once they breached that last barrier, things would never be the same again.

明日香瞪了他一会儿，然后笑了。她靠在他身上，吸收着他的体温，满足于他所提供的舒适。然而她知道不久就得动身，继续告诉他自己的想法。而这正是令人害怕的。红发女孩不知道他的反应会如何。由于她的提议至关重要，恐惧仍在她脑海深处徘徊，她担心他会误解。一旦他们突破了最后的障碍，一切都将不再相同。

“But that only made me love you more.” She paused. “It also made it harder for me to wait.”

“但这只会让我更爱你。”她停顿了一下。“也让我更难等待。”

“Asuka?” Shinji stared at the redhead when she looked up. “Are you…”

“明日香？” 真嗣盯着抬起头的红发女孩。“你…”

The woman rolled on top of him, shivering at the cold air on her back, contrasting with the heat coming from the warm body underneath her. Staring into dark blue eyes, she ignored the slight shaking of her body as she built up her courage. Taking a deep breath, she opened her mouth to speak but laughed when fingers traced along her ribs, tickling her. Glaring at the man, she grabbed his arms, forcing his hands away from her body for a moment. Releasing him, she smiled sadly, letting his hands return to her beautiful body. Sighing in relief when his fingers danced along her lower back, the redhead stared at Shinji.

女子翻身压在他身上，冷风拂过她的背脊，与身下温暖的躯体形成鲜明对比，令她不禁打了个寒颤。她凝视着那双深蓝色的眼睛，无视自己身体的轻微颤抖，鼓起勇气。深吸一口气，她张口欲言，却被沿着肋骨游走的指尖逗得笑出声来。她瞪了男子一眼，抓住他的手臂，迫使他的手暂时离开自己的身体。松开手后，她带着一丝哀伤的微笑，任由他的双手再次回到她美丽的身躯上。当他的手指轻抚过她的后腰时，红发女子如释重负地叹了口气，凝视着真嗣。

“I think I’m as…ready as I’ll ever be,” she finally told him, working on his shirt.

“我觉得我……已经准备得不能再好了，”她终于对他说道，一边整理着他的衬衫。

He felt her reach the last of the buttons, a hand slipping under the cloth and running across his chest. The shaking he felt from the redhead was mutual.

他感觉到她解开了最后一颗扣子，一只手伸进衣襟，轻抚过他的胸膛。从这位红发女子身上感受到的颤抖，他感同身受。

She pulled his shirt out of his pants, staring at him the whole time. “This is one of those decisions I was talking about earlier. So if you don’t want to do…”

她将他的衬衫从裤子里拽出来，全程盯着他。“这就是我之前说的那种决定。所以如果你不想做……”

Shinji reached up stroking her hair, causing her to stop and smile nervously. His hand trembled, knowing what she was saying. He could also feel the slight tremor in her hands as she pulled his shirt off. When Asuka started undoing his pants, he lay there watching her with wide eyes. Sky-blue eyes held him in place as she moved upward, her mouth coming closer. The man felt her breath on his lips when she stopped millimeters from his own. With the barest of movements he raised up, bringing their lips together, feeling Asuka tremble before she relaxed into the kiss. He held onto her gently, feeling her holding his head.

真嗣伸手轻抚她的头发，让她停下并紧张地笑了。他手在颤抖，明白她的话中之意。当明日香开始解他的裤子时，他躺在那里，睁大眼睛看着她。天蓝色的眼睛将他定住，她向上移动，嘴巴越来越近。当她停在他的唇前仅几毫米时，他感受到了她的呼吸。他微微抬起头，让他们的唇相触，感觉到明日香在放松进入这个吻之前颤抖了一下。他温柔地抱着她，感觉到她在捧着他的头。

The young couple moaned, their kiss becoming more enthusiastic, their bodies heating up. Shinji slid a hand over the cloth covering the redhead’s soft body, trailing it up her back. He felt her tremble and almost break the kiss when he reached her shapely posterior, caressing the warm flesh. Instead blue eyes narrowed in amusement before closing as she suckled on his lips, moaning at the touch. He closed his eyes when the redhead continued to kiss him. One hand moved to her slender neck, holding her gently while they remained locked together. He found himself moaning when she slid her tongue into his mouth and returned the favor. As their tongues battled, he couldn’t believe the intensity of their kiss. It was like all their other kisses had been little pecks between children.

年轻夫妇的呻吟声渐起，亲吻愈发炽烈，身体也热了起来。真嗣一手轻抚过红发女子柔软身躯上的布料，顺着她的背脊向上游走。触及她那曲线优美的臀部时，他感受到她的颤抖，几乎要中断这吻，只是轻抚着那温热的肌肤。然而，她那蓝色的眼眸先是闪过一丝戏谑，随后闭上，全心吮吸他的唇瓣，因触感而呻吟。当红发女子继续深吻时，他闭上了眼睛。一只手移至她纤细的颈项，温柔地拥住她，两人紧紧相依。当她将舌尖探入他口中，他也予以回应，不禁发出呻吟。随着舌尖的交缠，他难以置信这吻的激烈程度，仿佛之前所有的亲吻不过是孩童间的轻啄。

Asuka started gyrating her pelvis against his, groaning at the sensations going through her body, feeling him getting harder. The sensations only made the kiss more intense as she suckled his lips. It scared her that she wanted Shinji so badly, and at the same time it was exciting. She had never wanted anyone as much as him, to want him physically. Continuing to kiss him, sliding her tongue into his mouth, the redhead knew she had made the right decision when they became a couple. Her hands slipped under his shoulders, pulling him closer against her, feeling his body heat through the satin material. A string of saliva connected them for a moment when she finally broke the kiss.

明日香开始扭动她的骨盆贴合他的，随着身体感受到的刺激而呻吟，感觉到他变得更加坚硬。这种感觉让吻变得更加激烈，她吮吸着他的嘴唇。她害怕自己如此渴望真嗣，同时又感到兴奋。她从未如此渴望过任何人，渴望与他有身体的接触。继续亲吻他，将舌头滑入他的口中，这位红发女孩知道当他们成为一对时，她做出了正确的决定。她的手滑到他的肩膀下，将他拉得更近，透过缎面材料感受他的体温。当她最终结束这个吻时，一串唾液将他们短暂地连接在一起。

“I love you so much, Shinji.” She placed her mouth next to his ear. “And I want all of you,” Asuka whispered, huskily.

“我如此爱你，真嗣。”她将嘴唇贴近他的耳边。“我想要你的全部，”明日香低声耳语，声音略带沙哑。

The man tensed at her voice and admission.

听到她的声音和坦白，男子紧张起来。

“Shinji?” Her voice held a hint of worry. She lifted herself up, kneeling, and staring down at his face

“真嗣？”她的声音带着一丝忧虑。她起身跪坐，凝视着他的脸庞。

“I want you too, Asuka,” he said, after sitting up. “I love all of you, not just your physical beauty but your personality too.” He smiled at her expression. “You bring so much into my life each day.”

“我也想要你，明日香，”他坐起身来说道，“我爱你的全部，不仅仅是你的外貌，还有你的个性。”他对着她的表情微笑，“你每天给我的生活带来了这么多。”

She leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek.

她倾身向前，亲吻了他的脸颊。

The two sat there for a few moments waiting for the other to make the first move. Smiling nervously, Shinji moved closer to the woman, coming to a stop when he was in front of her and their knees were touching. His eyes wandered over her exquisite body before coming to rest on her face. Despite her words, she wouldn’t hold his gaze and her smile was a little forced. With a light touch his fingers ran up her arms, coming to rest on her shoulders, feeling the tight muscles under her smooth skin.

两人坐在那里，等待对方先行动。紧张地微笑着，真嗣向女子靠近，停在她面前，膝盖相触。他的目光在她精致的身躯上游走，最终停留在她的脸上。尽管她的话语如此，她却无法直视他的目光，笑容略显勉强。他轻触她的手臂，手指滑至她的肩膀，感受到她光滑皮肤下紧绷的肌肉。

As they sat there, he knew he couldn’t deny her wishes or desires without hurting her. She was the most beautiful person he had ever known and loved in his entire life, both in body and soul, strong yet fragile at the same time. And she had just told him she wanted all of him, and he had said the same. As he rubbed her shoulders getting her to relax. Leaning forward he brushed her silky hair over a pale shoulder.

他们坐在那里，他知道不能拒绝她的愿望或欲望，否则会伤害她。她是他一生中遇到的最美丽的人，无论是身体还是灵魂，既坚强又脆弱。她刚刚告诉他，她想要他的全部，他也这样回应了。他揉着她的肩膀，让她放松。他倾身向前，将她丝滑的头发拂过苍白的肩膀。

“I love you, Asuka.” “我爱你，明日香。”

The redhead smiled at those words, his tone carrying the emotions regardless of the words he chose. Something had changed as they had sat there, looking at each other. He was finally ready and it made Asuka want to cry in joy. A couple of tears slid down her cheeks as she reached out for him, holding him gently. She felt his hands move from her shoulders to her back, leaving a trail of warmth as they moved downward before coming to rest at her waist. Her body trembled at the touch, knowing what was happening and what was soon to come.

红发男子听到这些话，露出了微笑，他的语气中带着情感，无论他选择说什么。当他们坐在那里，彼此凝视时，有些东西已经改变了。他终于准备好了，这让明日香感动得想哭。几滴泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她伸出手去拥抱他，温柔地抱着他。她感觉到他的手从她的肩膀移到她的背部，留下了一道温暖的痕迹，然后向下移动，最终停在了她的腰间。她的身体因触碰而颤抖，知道正在发生的事情以及即将到来的事情。

“Don’t stop.” Her voice wavered. “I want do to this, Shin…mmmm.”

“别停下。”她的声音颤抖着。“我想这么做，真……嗯嗯。”

Her voice died as their lips met in a kiss filled with desire. A moan came from the redhead as she suckled on his lips, one hand on the back of Shinji’s head, keeping him in place. Her other hand traced over his torso, her nails scratching his skin ever so lightly, feeling him tremble at her touch. His own hands were busy on her body as he rubbed her smooth skin. The redhead found his trembling hands to be somewhat exciting yet she was aware he wasn’t the only one nervous. She stopped at the waist of his boxers, scared suddenly at what was going to happen. Looking at him, she saw shock on his face for an instant when she pushed the material downward, finally pulling it off with his help.

随着他们的唇瓣相触，她的声音消失了，取而代之的是一个充满欲望的吻。红发女子吮吸着他的嘴唇，一只手放在真嗣的后脑勺上，将他固定住。另一只手则在他的胸膛上游走，指甲轻轻刮过他的皮肤，感受到他在她的触碰下颤抖。他自己的手也在她的身体上忙碌着，抚摸着她光滑的肌肤。红发女子发现他颤抖的手有些令人兴奋，但她意识到紧张的不仅仅是他一个人。她停在他的内裤边缘，突然对即将发生的事情感到害怕。看着他，她看到当她将布料往下推时，他脸上闪过一丝震惊，最后在他的帮助下将其脱下。

“You can’t do it with these on.”

“戴着这些你做不了。”

Shinji gasped, when her hand gripped his erection and began stroking him. He was aware that her other hand had moved from the back of his head to his chest. A moan escaped his lips at the sensations running through his body at her gentle touch. As she continued to stroke him, he slid one hand under the hem of her negligee squeezing the warm flesh of her tight butt while his other continued to rub a tone, slender leg. When she trembled and moaned at his touch, Shinji looked at her, seeing her nod after a moment. Stopping his gentle caresses, he gripped the nightgown and slowly drew it upward, exposing her stunning body to the cool air. She had to stop her own rubbing, lifting her arms so he could remove the garment.

当她的手握住他的勃起并开始抚摸时，真嗣倒吸了一口气。他意识到她的另一只手已从他脑后移到了他的胸前。一阵快感袭来，他不禁轻声呻吟。随着她继续抚摸，他一只手滑到她的睡裙下，紧握着她紧实的臀部温暖的肌肤，另一只手则继续抚摸着她修长纤细的腿。当她因他的触碰而颤抖呻吟时，真嗣看着她，片刻后看到她点头。他停止了温柔的爱抚，抓住睡裙缓缓向上提起，让她的迷人身体暴露在凉爽的空气中。她不得不停下自己的抚摸，举起双臂以便他能脱下那件衣物。

“You’re…gorgeous,” he whispered.

“你真是…太美了，”他低声说道。

Those were the only words that could describe her once the thin negligee had been removed, baring her exquisite body to his view. Her creamy skin glowed in the light of the moon and candles, making her seem almost like an illusion. His eyes looked over her with desire and love. From her luscious breasts over her flat stomach to her mound, and finally over the gentle swell of her hips; she was the definition of perfection. Lightly he placed a hand over her heart, feeling her quiver at his touch.

那薄薄的睡衣一脱下，她的绝美身姿便展露无遗，唯有“惊艳”二字能形容。她那如奶油般细腻的肌肤在月光和烛光的映照下熠熠生辉，仿佛幻影一般。他的目光充满渴望与爱意，从她丰满的胸部，到平坦的小腹，再到她的私密之处，最后落在她柔和的臀线上；她完美得无可挑剔。他轻柔地将手放在她的心口，感受到她因他的触碰而微微颤抖。

“I mean it, Asuka. You’re the most beautiful person I have ever known.”

我是认真的，明日香。你是我所认识的最美的人。

“I know,” she replied smiling before gently removing his hand from her chest and wrapping her arms around him.

“我知道，”她微笑着回答，然后轻轻地从胸前移开他的手，双臂环抱住他。

She sat there waiting, worrying about what his inaction meant until his arms moved to her back. She guided him to the sheets, never releasing the hold on him until they lay on the bed facing each other. Watching his face, she removed a hand from his neck and brought it to rub his torso. As her fingers massaged his chest, she moved closer before draping a leg over one of his own. Eyes widened for a moment at the unexpected touch as her silky skin rubbed against him.

她坐在那里等待，担心他的无动于衷意味着什么，直到他的手臂移到她的背上。她引导他走向床单，始终没有放开对他的拥抱，直到他们躺在床上面对面。注视着他的脸，她从他的脖子上移开一只手，放在他的胸膛上按摩。随着手指在他的胸口按摩，她靠得更近，一条腿搭在他的腿上。她的丝滑肌肤触碰到他时，他的眼睛因这意外的触碰而睁大了一瞬间。

Shinji lay beside Asuka losing himself in the sensations of her gentle caresses. He trembled at the feeling of her smooth skin as she rubbed against his leg. Her body quivered when he finally shifted and returned the soft touch. Fingers slid down her side over her ribs and across her flat stomach, making a couple circles around her belly button as they made their way downward. He felt her tense when his fingers glided over the sensitive flesh of her mound. Nails dug into his chest and she gasped when he made contact with her inner thigh, stroking the soft flesh.

真嗣躺在明日香身边，沉醉于她温柔的抚摸中。当她光滑的肌肤摩擦着他的腿时，他不禁颤抖。当他终于移动并轻柔地回应时，她的身体也微微颤动。手指滑过她的侧腹，越过肋骨，横过平坦的腹部，绕着她的肚脐转了几圈，然后继续向下移动。当他的手指掠过她敏感的阴阜时，他感觉到她紧张起来。当他的手指触碰到她的大腿内侧，轻抚那柔软的肌肤时，她的指甲深深嵌入他的胸膛，她不禁倒吸一口气。

“Sorry,” she whispered, kissing him. A look of disappointment crossed her face when he stopped. “What are you…”

“对不起，”她轻声说着，吻了他一下。当他停下来时，失望的表情掠过她的脸庞。“你怎么了……”

Asuka found out what he was doing when he gently pushed her onto her back and climbed above her. Staring up at him, she stroked his cheek lightly as he lowered himself. A moan escaped her mouth when his fingers returned to massaging her legs, working their way inward and upward. She lay on her back with eyes closed, feeling her tension draining as the pleasure slowly built within her. It wasn’t like what they had done after the dance. As she rubbed his neck, Asuka knew this time was different. A whimper escaped her lips when a hand traced over the smooth flesh of her bust, brushing against an erect nipple.

当他在她背后轻轻一推，顺势爬到她上方时，明日香察觉到了他的意图。她仰望着他，轻抚他的脸颊，而他正缓缓俯身。当他的手指重新开始按摩她的双腿，逐渐向内向上移动时，她不禁发出一声轻吟。她闭着眼睛平躺着，感受到紧张感在愉悦的积累中慢慢消散。这与他们在舞蹈后的亲昵不同。当她抚摸他的脖颈时，明日香知道这次是另一番体验。当一只手滑过她胸前光滑的肌肤，轻触那挺立的乳头时，她忍不住发出一声呜咽。

Watching pleasure and excitement cross her face, Shinji took one of her breasts in hand, kneading the warm flesh. Each time his thumb brushed against a small pink nipple, a gasp escaped from her mouth. Continuing to massage her chest for a few minutes, alternating between breasts, he finally lowered his head to one, placing kisses on the pale mound, feeling her quiver at the touch. Slowly, with each kiss, he worked his way inward until finally reaching the erect nub. The tip of his tongue traced around her areola, getting the woman to arch her back and growl in frustration as he teased her.

看着她脸上交织的愉悦与兴奋，真嗣握住她的一侧乳房，揉捏着温热的肌肤。每当他的拇指轻触那小巧的粉红乳头，她便不由自主地发出一声轻喘。持续交替按摩她的双乳数分钟后，他终于俯下头，轻吻那苍白的隆起，感受到她因触碰而颤抖。随着每一次亲吻，他缓缓向内移动，直至触及那挺立的顶端。他用舌尖轻绕她的乳晕，使她不禁挺直背脊，发出一声夹杂着挫败感的低吼，因他的挑逗而愈发焦躁。

A cry of pain came from Asuka when he gently bit down. She held his head in her hands when he looked up in surprise and worry, drawing him up. Slowly she locked her lips against his, sliding her tongue into his mouth and moaning into the kiss when he went back to playing with her breasts. His touches were softer, slower so as not to hurt her unintentionally. She had to break the kiss when he stopped rubbing her legs, finally making contact with her moist folds. His fingers rubbed her flesh in gentle strokes, letting the pleasure build slowly. Gently he spread her lips, never stopping his rubbing as he let a finger trail up her inner labia. A frustrated whimper came from her lips as he avoided her most sensitive spot.

当阿斯加轻咬时，一声痛苦的呻吟从她口中逸出。他惊讶而担忧地抬头，她便用手捧住他的头，将他拉起。她缓缓地吻上他的唇，舌尖探入他的口中，当他再次轻抚她的乳房时，她在这吻中发出低吟。他的触碰更加轻柔缓慢，以免无意中弄疼她。当他停止摩挲她的双腿，终于触及她湿润的褶皱时，她不得不中断这个吻。他的手指以温柔的抚触滑过她的肌肤，让快感逐渐累积。他轻柔地分开她的唇瓣，手指沿着她的内阴唇轻抚，却始终避开她最敏感的部位，让她不禁发出一声挫败的呜咽。

Shinji relaxed when she started wiggling underneath him, her breath becoming faster as he rubbed her soft petals. He had been worried the mood and night had been ruined when she had cried out. That was not the case as was evident when she gripped his neck tighter with one hand, moaning. His own excitement grew from hearing those simple sounds coming from the woman. Leaning down he pressed his lips against hers, muffling a cry of pleasure as he spread her moist petals letting his thumb brush against her clitoris. He watched her close her eyes, surrendering to the sensations running through her body.

当她开始在他身下扭动，呼吸变得急促，他轻抚她柔软的花瓣时，真嗣放松了下来。他曾担心她的哭喊会破坏气氛和夜晚，但显然并非如此，因为她用一只手更紧地抓住他的脖子，呻吟着。听到女人发出这些简单的声音，他自己的兴奋也随之增长。他俯身吻住她的唇，抑制住愉悦的呼喊，同时分开她湿润的花瓣，让拇指轻触她的阴蒂。他看着她闭上眼睛，任由身体中的感觉席卷全身。

She broke the kiss, crying out in pleasure as his fingers gently squeezed the little nub before letting go. The stimulation kept building as he returned to stroking her, his thumb brushing against her sensitive spot every few strokes. She tensed when a finger slid into her, mewling at the sensations. It was too much for her body to handle and Asuka’s eyes clenched shut as her orgasm hit. Her vaginal muscles clenched around the invading finger, while her body quivered in pleasure.

她结束了这个吻，随着他的手指轻轻挤压那小巧的突起后又松开，她发出愉悦的呼喊。刺激不断累积，他继续抚摸她，每隔几次就用拇指轻触她的敏感点。当一根手指滑入她体内时，她紧张起来，对这种感觉发出呜咽声。她的身体难以承受，明日香的眼睛紧闭，随着高潮的到来。她的阴道肌肉紧缩着侵入的手指，身体在快感中颤抖。

The young man watched as her eyes cracked open and she gave him a dreamy smile. Returning the grin he bent down and kissed her tenderly over her upper chest, giving each of her luscious breasts a couple quick kisses before slowly moving. Her wiggling prompted him to smile when he kissed around her belly button. Rubbing her shoulders and arms, he traced his way back up between her breasts, his lips making contact every couple inches before going back down to her navel. Her back arched and she wrapped her legs around him when he started going lower toward her mound. He placed a couple kisses just above her pubic hair, his hands massaging her lower body, gliding over smooth skin.

年轻人注视着她眼眸缓缓睁开，那梦幻般的微笑浮现。他回以微笑，俯身在她胸口上方温柔地吻下，对那对诱人的乳房轻啄几下后，缓缓移动。她扭动的身躯让他吻至肚脐周围时露出笑容。他轻抚她的肩臂，沿着乳房间的轨迹再次上移，每过几寸便轻触其唇，随后又回到她的肚脐。当他开始向下探向她的私密处时，她背部弓起，双腿紧紧缠绕住他。他在她阴毛上方轻吻几下，双手按摩着她的下身，滑过那光滑的肌肤。

“Shinji.”

Asuka saw the man stop his massage and look up. Lifting her arms, she beckoned for him, seeing him flash a nervous smile before moving toward her upper body. Gently she pulled him down until she could feel his breath on her neck. One hand traced up and down his back feeling the tight muscles quiver at the light touch, but as she continued her work she felt him relax. With her other hand she played with his hair, letting it slide between her fingers before ruffling it into a tousled mess. Her lips made brief contact with his neck and shoulder.

明日香看到那个男人停止按摩，抬头望向她。她举起双臂，示意他过来，只见他露出一丝紧张的微笑，然后向她的上半身移动。她轻轻地将他拉下，直到能感受到他的呼吸拂过她的脖颈。一只手沿着他的背部上下游走，感受到紧绷的肌肉在轻触下微微颤抖，但随着她继续按摩，她感觉到他逐渐放松。另一只手则玩弄着他的头发，让它在指间滑动，然后将其揉成一团凌乱。她的嘴唇短暂地触碰了他的脖颈和肩膀。

“We both want this,” she whispered in his ear.

“我们都渴望这样，”她在他耳边低语。

“I know.” His voice wavered.

“我知道。”他的声音颤抖着。

“Then what’s the matter?”

“那有什么问题吗？”

He lifted himself up and looked into her eyes. “Just a little scared.”

他撑起身子，凝视着她的眼睛。“只是有点害怕。”

Her laugh was full of amusement. Gripping him by the shoulders, she pulled him back down. “And I’m not? This is very important to me, giving myself to you.” She kissed his cheek. “We’ve been working toward this moment for a long time. It’s the natural progression of a relationship. You go from friends to a couple to…”

她的笑声充满了乐趣。她抓住他的肩膀，把他拉回来。“难道我不是吗？这对我来说非常重要，把自己交给你。”她吻了他的脸颊。“我们为这一刻努力了很久。这是关系的自然发展。从朋友到情侣再到……”

“Lovers.”

“Yes.”

He stared into her wide-eyes. “I love you, Asuka.”

他凝视着她那双大眼睛。“我爱你，明日香。”

“And I love you, Shinji.”

“我也爱你，真嗣。”

“I don’t want to hurt you.” He swallowed nervously.

“我不想伤害你。”他紧张地咽了咽口水。

“It can’t be helped.” “没办法了。”

“I’ll be gentle.” “我会温柔的。”

She pulled him down until her mouth was next to his ear. “I know but whatever happens, don’t stop unless I tell you to.” He tensed in her hands.

她把他拉下来，直到她的嘴靠近他的耳朵。“我知道，但无论发生什么，除非我告诉你，否则不要停。”他在她的手中紧张起来。

“I promise.”

Shinji watched as Asuka snuggled deeper into the soft bed, looking up at him as he moved between her legs. Their eyes met again and she nodded to him. His fingers rubbed over the soft skin of her slender legs, feeling her tremble at his touch. Slowly he worked toward her glistening flower, all the while watching Asuka’s face. Her stomach tensed when he made contact, his hand resting lightly on her folds. Moans came from her mouth as he brushed his thumb across her clitoris, exciting her. Her eyes closed as he took his hardened manhood in hand, rubbing it against her moist folds. A moan escaped his lips as he made contact with her, sliding deeper into her. It was the most intense pleasure he had ever felt.

真嗣看着明日香更深地蜷缩进柔软的床里，抬头望着他移动到她的双腿之间。他们的目光再次相遇，她向他点了点头。他的手指抚摸着她纤细腿上的柔软肌肤，感觉到她因他的触碰而颤抖。他慢慢地向她那闪亮的花朵靠近，同时一直注视着明日香的脸。当他的手轻轻触碰到她的花瓣时，她的腹部紧绷起来。当他用拇指轻拂她的阴蒂时，她发出了呻吟，使她兴奋不已。她的眼睛闭上了，他握住自己坚硬的阳具，在她的湿润花瓣上摩擦。当他与她接触时，一声呻吟从他的唇边逸出，他更深入地滑入她的体内。这是他感受到的最强烈的快感。

Asuka whimpered in excitement as she felt the tip of his penis part her labia and introduce itself into her hot vagina. The excitement turned to pain, her inner muscles stretched as he thrust in deeper. She felt a finger stroke her cheek, wiping away a tear. Dark blue eyes stared at her, full of worry as he had stopped at her cry of pain. Reaching up, she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and gave him a small smile as they looked at each other. The moment she had been waiting and longing for was finally here. The fear that had been in the back of her mind, telling her she could be making a mistake, was gone. And as she lay there Asuka knew she had no regrets about anything. She wanted this, to finally give all herself to the man she loved.

当她感觉到他的阴茎尖端分开她的阴唇，进入她火热的阴道时，明日香兴奋地呜咽着。兴奋转为痛苦，她的内肌随着他更深的插入而拉伸。她感觉到一根手指抚摸着她的脸颊，擦去了一滴泪水。深蓝色的眼睛注视着她，充满了担忧，因为他听到她的痛苦呼喊而停了下来。她伸手环抱住他的肩膀，给了他一个微笑，两人对视着。她一直期待和渴望的时刻终于到来了。一直潜伏在她脑海中的恐惧，告诉她可能会犯错，已经消失了。当她躺在那里时，明日香知道自己对任何事情都没有后悔。她想要这个，终于把自己完全献给她所爱的男人。

“Don’t stop,” she whispered.

“别停下，”她低声说。

Kissing him, she kept their lips locked as he drew back slightly. Her nails dug into his shoulder and she cried into the kiss, her eyes squeezed shut, when he thrust into her completely. Tears trickled down her cheeks as she held him against her, the pain greater then she had thought it would be. She could feel his hardness within her, his warmth surrounding and filling her, as they remained perfectly still. Minutes later, she looked up and gave him a small nod. Her legs wrapped around his waist, holding him in place, rocking her hips to get comfortable. Even with the pain she was feeling, a moan escaped as he pulled back before thrusting into her again.

她亲吻着他，当他的唇稍稍退后时，她仍紧锁着双唇。她的指甲深深嵌入他的肩膀，在他完全进入她时，她紧闭双眼，泪水伴随着亲吻涌出。泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她紧紧抱住他，疼痛比预想的还要强烈。她能感受到他的坚硬在她体内，他的温暖环绕并填满了她，两人静止不动。几分钟后，她抬头给了他一个小小的点头。她的双腿缠绕在他的腰间，将他固定，扭动臀部以寻求舒适。尽管疼痛袭来，当他在抽出后再次挺进时，她还是忍不住发出了一声呻吟。

Shinji moaned as he slowly thrust into her over and over, her muscles gripping him in a hot, wet embrace. It was the most intense feeling he had ever felt and he fought to keep control. Looking down, he saw Asuka with her eyes closed, moaning at the pleasure of their joining. He could feel her warm body beneath him, writhing as he kept up his pace. His hips slid across hers as she moved upward, letting his manhood go as deep as possible before they withdrew before meeting again. Each joining only increased the pleasure and excitement going through their bodies. Strong hands pulled him down, her breasts rubbing against his chest in time with the thrusts. Her eyes opened when he slowed his thrusting even more.

真嗣低声呻吟着，缓缓地一次次深入她体内，她的肌肉紧紧地包裹着他，带来炽热而湿润的拥抱。这是他从未体验过的强烈感受，他努力维持着控制。低头望去，只见明日香双眼紧闭，因结合的快感而呻吟。他能感受到她温暖的身躯在下方扭动，随着他保持节奏。他的臀部在她向上移动时滑过她的，让他的男性象征尽可能深入，然后撤出，再次相遇。每一次结合都让快感和兴奋在他们的身体中愈发强烈。有力的双手将他拉下，她的乳房随着他的冲击与他的胸膛摩擦。当他进一步放慢冲击时，她的眼睛睁开了。

The redhead kissed his neck, her hands running along his back. The smooth skin of her thighs rubbed against his hips as they moved in time with each other. Closing her eyes, she let the sensation of him penetrating her course through her body. The way his member rubbed against her tight vagina, providing constant stimulation was exhilarating. Her pain was still there, contrasting with the pleasure as he made love to her. She held him close, ignoring the pain, feeling her body heating up as they worked to their climax. A grunt came from above her and she opened her eyes. She stroked his cheek while moving her other hand off his back.

红发女子吻着他的脖子，双手沿着他的背部游走。她光滑的大腿肌肤摩擦着他的臀部，两人随着彼此的节奏移动。她闭上眼睛，任由他进入自己体内的感觉传遍全身。他的阳具在她紧致的阴道内摩擦，持续的刺激令人兴奋。她的痛楚依旧存在，与快感形成对比，他在与她做爱。她紧紧抱住他，无视疼痛，感受着身体因他们的努力而升温，直至高潮。上方传来一声咕哝，她睁开眼睛。她抚摸着他的脸颊，另一只手从他的背上移开。

Sweat dripped off Shinji’s chin as he gritted his teeth, fighting his body. Her inner walls hugged and surrounded him in a tight grip. Each time he rocked against her, going deeper into her, brought him nearer to his climax. Still he would make it last as long as possible for her, never picking up his pace. He looked into her face, startled, when he felt her hand slide to their joining.

汗水从真嗣的下巴滴落，他咬紧牙关，与自己的身体抗争。她的内壁紧紧包裹并环绕着他，每次他向她深处推进，都让他更接近高潮。尽管如此，他仍会尽可能延长这一刻，为她而坚持，从不加快节奏。当他感觉到她的手滑向他们结合之处时，他惊讶地看向她的脸。

Asuka started panting, moaning into Shinji’s ear as her fingers stroked and rubbed her clitoris. She felt herself quickly approaching the ultimate ecstasy from his thrusting and her own stimulation. Her free hand moved up and down his back, feeling the muscles moving and tensing as he pleasured her. A tingling sensation she had felt during their joining reached its peak as she climaxed. She felt her stomach tense and her back arch as her inner muscles tightened around Shinji’s manhood. Warmth spread out from her belly as his essence filled her. She smiled as he fell limply onto her, one arm draped over her shoulder.

明日香开始喘息，呻吟声传入真嗣的耳中，她的手指轻抚并揉搓着自己的阴蒂。她感觉到自己正迅速接近由他的冲刺和自我刺激带来的极致快感。她空着的那只手在他的背上上下移动，感受着肌肉随着他给予的愉悦而移动和紧绷。当她达到高潮时，那种在结合过程中感受到的刺痛感达到了顶峰。她感到腹部紧绷，背部拱起，内肌紧紧包裹着真嗣的阳具。随着他的精华填满她，一股暖流从她的腹部扩散开来。当真嗣无力地倒在她的身上，一只手臂搭在她的肩膀上时，她微笑了。

Gently he gripped her shoulders, rolling onto his back and bringing her with him. He smiled weakly at her, seeing her face flushed from excitement and with a sheen of sweat. Shinji think was how beautiful she was and how much he wanted her to stay in his life. He watched as Asuka lowered herself, smiling, with her eyes slowly closing as their lips met.

他轻轻地抓住她的肩膀，翻身仰卧，并带着她一起。他虚弱地对她微笑，看到她的脸因兴奋而泛红，额头上有一层薄汗。真嗣心想她有多美，他多么希望她能留在他的生活中。他看着明日香低下身子，微笑着，眼睛慢慢闭上，他们的嘴唇相遇。

- - - -

Shinji awoke to a warm weight lying on his chest. Opening his eyes, he saw a mess of red hair as Asuka rested on him. A smile formed when he saw how relaxed and innocent her face looked. Looking up at the ceiling all he could remember was the night before, the excitement and feelings as they had sex for the first time. It only made him love her more, knowing they had shared something special together. Gently he slipped an arm around her warm, nude body pulling her up so her head soon rested in the crook of his neck. His hand slid over the soft skin of her arm as he rubbed her.

真嗣醒来时，感到胸口有一股温暖的重量。睁开眼，他看到一团红发，原来是明日香正躺在他身上。看到她那放松而纯真的面容，他不禁微笑起来。抬头望向天花板，他只记得前一晚的情景，那种兴奋和情感，因为他们第一次共度云雨。这让他更加爱她，知道他们共同分享了某种特别的东西。他轻柔地将一只手臂环绕在她温暖赤裸的身体上，把她拉起来，让她的头靠在他颈窝里。他的手滑过她柔软的肌肤，轻抚着她的手臂。

“Mmm…Shinji,” she mumbled.

“嗯……真嗣，”她喃喃道。

It was obvious she was dreaming from her words, and his smile grew wider. He was happy he had been able to make such an impression. Shifting, he reached down to pull the sheet over the both of them, amazed they had been able to sleep in the cool room, though they had been quite warm when they had fallen asleep. His movement stopped when he saw what time it was, and he rolled on to his back again, sighing. Finally he gripped her shoulders and gently shook her.

从她的话语中明显看出她在做梦，他的笑容更加灿烂。他很高兴自己能留下如此深刻的印象。他挪动身体，伸手拉过被子盖住两人，惊讶于他们竟能在凉爽的房间里入睡，尽管入睡时他们感觉很温暖。当他看到时间时，动作停了下来，又翻身仰躺，叹了口气。最终，他握住她的肩膀，轻轻摇醒她。

“Asuka, wake up. It’s late,” he whispered while trying to wake her. Seeing his shaking wasn’t working, Shinji traced his fingers over her ribs and stomach. He continued this, feeling the woman squirm and chuckle at the feeling, until she grabbed his hand.

“明日香，醒醒。已经很晚了，”他低声说着，试图唤醒她。见摇晃无效，真嗣便用手指轻抚她的肋骨和腹部。他持续这样做，感受到女子因触感而扭动并轻笑，直到她抓住了他的手。

“Stop it,” she mumbled. “别闹了，”她含糊地说。

She awoke slowly, her eyes opening in increments. Her nails scratched him lightly as her hand flexed a couple of times, working the tension out. A smile formed on her lips as she realized where she was and pushed herself off his chest. The smile didn’t fade but instead grew wider as she straddled him, her hands holding his head. She licked her lips before leaning down, her tongue tracing up his neck and around his ear.

她缓缓醒来，眼睛一点点睁开。她的指甲轻轻刮过他的皮肤，随着手的几次伸展，缓解了紧张。当她意识到自己身在何处时，嘴角浮现出微笑，并从他的胸膛上撑起自己。那微笑并未消退，反而更加灿烂，她跨坐在他身上，双手捧着他的头。她舔了舔嘴唇，然后俯身下去，舌头沿着他的脖子滑至耳边。

“Morning lover,” she purred after giving him a peck on the lips.

“早上好，亲爱的，”她亲吻了他的嘴唇后柔声说道。

“Good morning,” he replied with a smile.

“早上好，”他微笑着回答。

They lay there looking at each other not saying a word for a few moments. Shinji reached up and brushed some of her hair out of her face. He shifted under her as she rubbed her crotch against him, feeling his manhood reacting. His hands trailed over her soft body, stopping at her slender waist. With a little difficulty he sat up, holding her in a gentle embrace. He looked into her eyes as he ran his fingers through her hair.

他们躺在那里，彼此凝视，几秒钟内没有说一句话。真嗣伸手将她脸上的几缕头发拨开。随着她用胯部摩擦他，感受到他的男性反应，他在她身下动了动。他的手抚过她柔软的身体，停在纤细的腰间。他费了点劲坐起来，温柔地拥抱着她。他凝视着她的眼睛，手指穿过她的发丝。

“Ummm…so how are you?” he asked quietly.

“嗯……你怎么样？”他轻声问道。

“Loved. A little giddy.” After each word she kissed him. “I feel very good at the moment. Why?”

“被爱着。有点飘飘然。”她每说一个字就吻他一下。“我现在感觉非常好。怎么了？”

“It’s just that…” He averted his eyes, but a finger on his chin made him look up. “A couple of times last night you looked like you were in pain.”

“只是……”他移开目光，但一根手指轻触下巴，让他抬起头来。“昨晚有几次，你看起来像是在痛苦中。”

Asuka sat there looking him in the eyes, a little shocked at the statement. She draped her arms over his shoulders, crossing her wrists behind his neck. A frown crossed his face as she pouted. It had hurt quite a bit and as she thought about it she became aware of the soreness in her lower body.

明日香坐在那里，直视他的眼睛，对这番话感到有些震惊。她将双臂搭在他的肩上，手腕交叉于他颈后。她噘嘴时，他皱起了眉头。确实相当痛，当她回想起时，她意识到下半身传来的酸痛感。

“It did hurt but there was nothing you could have done.” She felt him tense at her statement. “And it will hurt our first few times.”

“虽然当时很痛，但你也无法做什么。”她感觉到他在她的话语中紧张起来。“而且最初几次都会痛。”

“But…”

“I know you don’t want to hurt me or see me in pain but this is natural.” Her cheeks blushed. “There are two ways to ease it.”

“我知道你不想让我受伤或看到我痛苦，但这是自然的。”她的脸颊泛起红晕。“有两种方法可以缓解。”

Shinji felt his own cheeks heat up. “What are they?”

真嗣感到自己的脸颊发热。“那是什么？”

“We never have sex again.” She laughed at his look. “Don’t worry I’m not going to do that.” He trembled at her words. “It’s just too much fun.”

“我们再也不做爱了。”她看着他惊讶的表情笑了起来。“别担心，我不会那么做的。”他因她的话而颤抖。“只是太有趣了。”

“So what’s the other option?” he asked.

“那另一个选项是什么？”他问道。

Asuka laughed at both his question and his tickling her. “Stop that! I wish you’d never found out I was ticklish.”

明日香对他的问题和挠她痒痒都笑了。“别这样！真希望你从没发现我怕痒。”

“Don’t you like it?” He sounded hurt.

“难道你不喜欢吗？”他的声音听起来很受伤。

“Of course I do.” She held his hands in a gentle grip. “But I’m trying to be serious here.”

“我当然喜欢。”她温柔地握住他的手。“但我现在想认真一点。”

“Sorry.” Their fingers intertwined. “So what’s the second option?”

“对不起。”他们的手指交缠在一起。“那么第二个选项是什么？”

Asuka fell backward pulling him with her, laughing so hard, tears came to her eyes. Looking at his frown, she pulled her laughing under control and wiped her eyes. She tousled his hair, making it messier than it already was. Her fingers traced over his lips, seeing him smile at the touch. Suddenly she pushed him upward before sitting up herself and turning around. She squirmed backward until she was sitting in his lap, his arms around her.

明日香向后倒去，拉着他一起，笑得如此厉害，眼泪都涌了出来。看着他皱眉的样子，她努力控制住笑声，擦了擦眼睛。她弄乱了他的头发，比之前更乱了。她的手指划过他的嘴唇，看到他因触碰而微笑。突然，她将他推起，然后自己也坐起来，转过身去。她扭动着向后挪，直到坐在他的腿上，他的手臂环绕着她。

“We do it more often. That’s the second option.” Her voice was cheerful.

“我们更常这么做。那是第二个选项。”她的声音很欢快。

“Okay!” he replied, smiling widely. One of his hands glided over her stomach. “So…”

“好的！”他回答道，笑容满面。他的手轻轻滑过她的腹部。“那么……”

She grabbed his hand, turning her head to glare. “I didn’t mean now, you idiot!” She released his hand. “Just hold me. I’m still sore.”

她抓住他的手，转过头来怒目而视。“我不是说现在，你这个笨蛋！”她松开他的手。“就抱着我吧，我还疼着呢。”

“I wasn’t suggesting we do it.” He kissed the back of her neck gently. “I was going to ask what you wanted to do today.”

“我并不是提议我们要做那件事。”他轻吻她的后颈，“我本想问你今天想做什么。”

“Oh.” She turned around in his arms, lazily leaning up against him. “Well since it’s my decision, how about…” Her fingers scratched his skin lightly as she dragged them across his torso. “How about you just hold me for now? We can decide what else to do later.”

“哦。”她在他的怀里转过身，慵懒地靠在他身上。“既然是我做决定，那不如……”她的手指轻轻地划过他的皮肤，沿着他的胸膛轻挠。“不如你现在就抱着我吧？我们晚点再决定还要做什么。”

“There’s the opera tonight.”

“今晚有歌剧。”

“I said we can decide later.”

“我说了我们晚点再决定。”

Shinji nodded at her words, slowly moving backward as she pushed him. He soon found himself in the same position he had woken up in, with Asuka laying half on top him. Her silky hair was like a blanket covering his shoulder and upper chest. A tremor ran through her body as his fingers went down her back and over her hip before dragging the sheet over the both of them. His hand returned to her back as she snuggled up against him, wrapping her arms around him.

真嗣对她的话点了点头，随着她的推动慢慢后退。不久，他发现自己又回到了刚醒来时的姿势，明日香半趴在他身上。她那如丝般顺滑的头发像毯子一样覆盖在他的肩膀和胸口。当他的手指沿着她的背部滑到臀部，然后拉过床单盖住两人时，她的身体微微颤抖。他的手回到她的背上，而她则依偎在他怀里，双臂环绕着他。

“Did you enjoy it?” he asked after some time.

“你享受了吗？”过了一会儿他问道。

“Yes, though it wasn’t exactly what I was expecting.”

是的，虽然它并不完全符合我的预期。

“What were you expecting?”

“你在期待什么呢？”

“Don’t really know. Still it was fun.” She looked up to see him frowning. “What?”

“其实不太清楚。不过还是挺有趣的。”她抬头看见他皱着眉头。“怎么了？”

“Parties are fun,” Shinji remarked, his frown deepening. “Sex isn’t fun.”

“聚会很有趣，” 真嗣说道，眉头皱得更深了。“性爱并不有趣。”

“It isn’t? It was for me,” Asuka replied with a grin.

“不是吗？对我来说很有趣，” 明日香笑着回答。

“You know what I mean.”

你懂我的意思。

“Sorry, I don’t really know how to put it into words. Fun just seemed like the right emotion. But don’t worry, it was much more than that.”

“抱歉，我真的不知道该如何用言语表达。快乐似乎是最恰当的情绪。但别担心，它远不止于此。”

His frown eased, turning into a sad smile. “You had fun even though you had to…” He blushed and trailed off, unable to say the last words.

他的皱眉舒缓了，转变成一个悲伤的微笑。“你玩得很开心，尽管你不得不……”他脸红了，话没说完就停了下来，无法说出最后几个字。

Again she laughed. “That was our first time. I wanted it to be special, to reach my climax with you.” She stroked his cheek lovingly. “There are a variety of positions, Shinji. We’ll find one that works for us.”

她又笑了。“那是我们的第一次，我想让它特别，想和你一起达到高潮。”她温柔地抚摸着他的脸颊。“有很多种姿势，真嗣。我们会找到适合我们的。”

“Still…”

“I said don’t worry!” Asuka grimaced. “Don’t worry about it, okay? If you think about it then when we make love again, you’ll be all tense and won’t enjoy it.” She wiggled against him, draping a leg over his. “Sex is about pleasing each other and having fun. And I want you to enjoy it as much as I do.”

“我说了别担心！”明日香皱眉道。“别担心这个，好吗？如果你一直想着这事，那下次我们亲热时，你会紧张得无法享受。”她在他身上扭动，一条腿搭在他身上。“性爱是关于彼此取悦和享受的。我希望你能像我一样享受它。”

“Okay.” He mumbled “好的。”他嘟囔道

“Don’t pout.” She stared into his eyes. “I love you, Shinji. Nothing will ever change that, especially after last night.”

“别撅嘴了。”她凝视着他的眼睛。“我爱你，真嗣。尤其是经历了昨晚之后，这一点永远不会改变。”

Asuka returned her head to his chest after seeing him smile at her words. As she listened to his heartbeat she knew it was the truth and so did he. After the night before she knew she had not made a mistake in making love to him. He was meant for her and she was meant for him. Her smile grew at the thought and she purred as he rubbed her back and shoulder, slowly falling asleep against his warmth.

明日香在看到他对自己的话露出微笑后，将头靠回他的胸膛。听着他的心跳，她知道这是真的，他也一样。经过昨晚，她知道自己没有在和他做爱这件事上犯错。他注定属于她，她也注定属于他。想到这里，她的笑容更灿烂了，当他在她背上和肩膀上轻抚时，她发出满足的咕噜声，渐渐在他温暖的怀抱中睡去。

- - - -

“Hey, Shinji! Could you come and help me with something.”

“嘿，真嗣！你能过来帮我个忙吗？”

The man grinned and left the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He knew what the redhead wanted from the way she had been acting ever since they had returned from the opera. She had sent every signal from rubbing herself against him to the kissing and petting in the limousine on the way back to the hotel. But the obvious was when she had asked him to help her out of the green dress she had worn and then telling him to take a shower. So he wasn’t surprised when he saw her sprawled out in the bed again. She crossed her arms and glowered at him.

男人咧嘴一笑，裹着浴巾离开了浴室。他知道那个红发女子想要什么，从他们从歌剧院回来后她的行为就一目了然。她从紧贴着他摩擦到在回酒店的豪华轿车里亲吻抚摸，无一不在传递信号。但最明显的是，她让他帮忙脱下那件绿色裙子，然后又让他去洗澡。所以当他再次看到她躺在床上时，并不感到惊讶。她交叉双臂，怒视着他。

“You knew, didn’t you?”

“You were quite direct with your signals, Asuka.” He leaned down and kissed her. “All you had to do was just come out and say it. I wouldn’t have said no.”

“你的信号相当直接，明日香。”他俯身吻了她。“你只需直说就行，我不会拒绝的。”

“Didn’t you like the attention?” She pouted, drawing a laugh. “The little touches and kisses.”

“难道你不喜欢这种关注吗？”她噘起嘴，引得一阵笑声。“那些小动作和亲吻。”

“I enjoyed them.” He eased himself onto the bed, grinning. “So what did you want my help with?”

“我很享受。”他轻松地坐到床上，咧嘴笑道。“那你需要我帮什么忙呢？”

She pushed him on to his back and straddled him, the soft skin of her thighs rubbing against his waist. A smile formed as she forced his hands away from her body, pinning him to the bed. Ever so slowly she rubbed herself against his lower body, listening to him moan. He wasn’t the only one enjoying the sensations as she felt him grow hard, his manhood rubbing against her. Leaning down she placed her mouth next to his ear, letting out a small whimper and feeling him tense.

她将他推倒在床上，跨坐在他身上，柔软的大腿肌肤摩擦着他的腰际。她微笑着，将他的双手从自己身上推开，按在床上。她缓缓地在他下身摩擦，听着他呻吟。享受这感觉的不止他一人，她感觉到他变得坚硬，他的男性象征与她摩擦。她俯下身，将嘴唇贴近他的耳朵，发出一声轻呜，感觉到他紧张起来。

“Nothing, since you obviously don’t want to do anything with me tonight,” she said smirking.

“没什么，既然你今晚显然不想和我做任何事。”她带着一丝戏谑说道。

“I never said that!” “我从未说过那样的话！”

The redhead laughed. “You’re so easy. So do you like what I’m wearing?”

红发女子笑道：“你真好骗。那你觉得我这身打扮怎么样？”

Shinji looked at the blue bra and bikini-cut panties and nodded his head enthusiastically. He loved the way the color contrasted with her creamy skin and auburn hair. As she leaned down, a scent of perfume drifted off her body, increasing his arousal. Gently he placed his hands on her shoulders, pulling her down, until he felt the satin material on his chest. His fingers inched slowly down her back, stopping at the clasp to her bra. Sky blue eyes narrowed in humor as she wiggled on top of him.

真嗣看着那蓝色的胸罩和比基尼式内裤，热情地点了点头。他喜欢这种颜色与她奶油般的肌肤和赤褐色头发形成的对比。当她俯身时，一阵香水味从她身上飘散开来，令他更加兴奋。他轻柔地将手放在她的肩上，拉她下来，直到感受到胸前的缎面材质。他的手指缓缓滑下她的背部，停在胸罩的搭扣处。天蓝色的眼睛因幽默而眯起，她在他身上扭动着。

“Well go on. I don’t have to tell you what to do, do I?” Her smile grew after that, feeling his fingers fumbling to undo her bra.

“那就继续吧。我不需要告诉你该做什么，对吧？”她的笑容在那之后更加灿烂，感受到他的手指在努力解开她的胸罩。

A small click signaled his success and she let out a sigh as his hands slid over her now bare back. Sitting up, she held the garment in place with an arm across her chest. Grinning widely she withdrew the arm and slowly drew the straps down her shoulders one at a time, before tossing the bra to the floor. She leaned back down, letting her hair gently caressing his chest. A whimper came from her lips as Shinji reached up to grasp her breasts.

一声轻响标志着他的成功，她叹了口气，任由他的手滑过她现在裸露的后背。坐起身来，她用一只手臂横在胸前，紧紧抓住衣物。她咧嘴一笑，收回手臂，慢慢地将肩带逐一拉下肩膀，然后将胸罩扔到地上。她再次俯身，让头发轻轻拂过他的胸膛。当真嗣伸手握住她的乳房时，她唇间发出了一声呜咽。

The man watched as Asuka closed her eyes at his rubbing of her breasts. He loved the feeling of her mounds, firm yet soft, squeezing her gently and eliciting a moan for his efforts. Each time he touched her, a tremor would course through her body. Her moans changed to gasps and she opened her eyes to stare at him, hungrily.

男子注视着，当他的揉搓让明日香闭上了眼睛。他喜欢她那坚实而柔软的乳房，轻柔地挤压着，为了他的努力而发出一声呻吟。每次他触碰她，她的身体都会掠过一阵颤栗。她的呻吟变成了喘息，睁开眼睛，饥渴地盯着他。

A gasp escaped the redhead’s lips as Shinji brushed across a small erect nipple, sending pleasure shooting through her body. She eased herself forward until she was sure her breasts were above his face. Slowly Asuka lowered herself, feeling him cup her breasts a moment before his mouth made contact with her sensitive flesh. The tip of his tongue flicked across her nipple, making her moan more as he traced circles around the erect nub. Her arms quivered as his lips sealed around it and he started sucking on the nipple gently. She was barely aware when he switched to her other breast, repeating his technique. As the pleasure grew, she lifted herself up, breaking the contact.

红发少女不禁倒吸一口气，因为真嗣轻触到了她那挺立的小乳头，一股快感瞬间传遍全身。她缓缓前倾，确保自己的胸部悬在他的脸上方。慢慢地，明日香俯下身，感觉到他在用嘴触碰她敏感的肌肤前先捧住了她的乳房。他的舌尖轻弹她的乳头，随着他在那挺立的小点周围画圈，她的呻吟声愈发强烈。当他的嘴唇含住乳头并开始温柔地吮吸时，她的手臂微微颤抖。她几乎没注意到他已换到另一侧乳房，重复着同样的技巧。随着快感的增强，她抬起身体，中断了接触。

Shinji lifted himself up after her, bringing his lips into contact with hers as one hand slid along her stomach. He felt her tremble when he slipped his fingers into her panties. She groaned at his touch when his fingers started stroking her moist petals. Slowly she started gyrating her crotch against his, increasing the pressure on his hand, which increased her own pleasure. A frown crossed her face when she felt his fingers retreat from her panties, feeling him grip her shoulders.

真嗣在明日香起身之后也坐了起来，将嘴唇贴上她的，同时一只手沿着她的腹部滑过。当他的手指伸进她的内裤时，他感觉到她在颤抖。他的手指开始轻抚她湿润的花瓣，她因他的触碰而呻吟。慢慢地，她开始扭动胯部抵住他，增加他手上的压力，从而也增加了自己的快感。当她感觉到他的手指从内裤中抽离，转而抓住她的肩膀时，她的脸上掠过一丝不悦。

“Not tonight,” she said, giving him a naughty smile. “It’s my turn to be on top.”

“今晚不行，”她笑着说，给了他一个调皮的微笑。“这次轮到我在上面了。”

“Oh…okay.”

Asuka laughed at his disappointment. “It’ll be fun, I promise.” She leaned down. “Now why don’t you help me get out of these.”

明日香对他的失望笑了笑。“我保证会很有趣的。”她俯下身。“现在，你何不帮我脱掉这些呢。”

Her smile grew as Shinji sat up and reached for her underwear, after a moment’s hesitation. He hooked his thumbs under the elastic band and with a gentle tug started pulling them down. A tremor went through her body as he pulled them down across her hips and down her legs. She laughed at his expression as he reached her knees, before quickly removing the small garment herself, dropping it on him. Her other hand slipped down to the towel around his waist, and tugging it open. Picking up the lace and silk underwear, she held it in front of his face while she gently stroked him to full hardness.

她的笑容随着真嗣坐起身来并伸手去拿她的内裤而绽放，犹豫片刻后，他用拇指勾住松紧带，轻柔地一拉，开始往下褪去。随着内裤滑过她的臀部和双腿，她的身体微微颤抖。当内裤褪至膝盖时，她看到他的表情，不禁笑出声来，随后迅速自己脱掉那小巧的衣物，扔在他身上。她的另一只手则探向围在他腰间的毛巾，轻轻一拉将其解开。她拾起蕾丝丝绸内裤，举在他面前，同时温柔地抚摸他，直至他完全坚挺。

“Do you like it so far?”

“到目前为止，你喜欢吗？”

He swallowed at her touch. “Yes.”

她一触碰，他便不由自主地吞咽了一下。“是的。”

“Good.”

Dropping the underwear over the side, she felt Shinji grip her hips when she lifted herself and shifted backward. Gently she held his hardened penis with one hand, guiding him into herself as she lowered her body. Moans came from the two young lovers as the tip of his manhood parted her soft lips and slowly entered her wet tunnel. She released him, feeling his hardness rubbing against her inner muscles, and placed her hands next to his shoulders. It still hurt but a sigh came from her mouth when he was fully inside her, feeling different areas of her body being stimulated.

她将内裤丢到一旁，当她抬起身体并往后挪动时，感觉到真嗣抓住了她的臀部。她用一只手轻轻握住他坚硬的阴茎，引导他进入自己体内，同时身体缓缓下沉。两位年轻恋人发出呻吟，他的阴茎尖端分开她柔软的唇瓣，慢慢进入她湿润的通道。她松开手，感受到他的坚硬在她的内肌上摩擦，然后将双手放在他的肩膀旁。虽然还有些痛，但当他完全进入她时，她还是不由自主地发出了一声叹息，感觉到身体各处被刺激着。

Shinji watched the redhead’s face as she panted above him, moans coming from his lips as she rocked against him. Gently he stroked her back while he slid his other hand down to their union, remembering the night before. Her eyes looked onto his in surprise, before filling with passion as he nodded his head. He held her as he felt her rise up before bringing herself back down. Pressing his lips against her throat, he felt her moans, even as his pleasure grew.

真嗣注视着红发女孩在他上方喘息的面庞，随着她的摇摆，他的唇间逸出呻吟。他轻抚她的背，另一只手则滑向两人的结合处，回忆起前一晚。她的目光惊讶地投向他，随后被激情填满，他点头回应。他紧抱着她，感受她起身又回落。他的唇紧贴她的喉咙，感受着她的呻吟，同时自己的快感也在增长。

Asuka slowly slid up and down his hard manhood, cataloguing the range of sensations she was getting. The back walls of her vagina were getting the most stimulation, as was her clitoris. She had been surprised to feel her bud being rubbed when she had initially come down on him. But as she continued to drive herself onto him, she gave into the pleasure. Looking her lover in the eyes, she grinned, picking up her pace.

明日香缓缓地在他坚硬的男性象征上上下滑动，细细体会着各种感觉。她的阴道后壁和阴蒂得到了最多的刺激。最初坐下时，她惊讶地感觉到自己的阴蒂被摩擦。但随着她继续将自己推向他，她沉溺于快感之中。她凝视着爱人的眼睛，露出了笑容，加快了节奏。

“Let’s go faster.”

Shinji looked up into Asuka’s face as she picked up the pace of her lovemaking. Her eyes excited him as they were filled with a wild passion and hunger. Still grinning she lowered herself, not slowing, bringing her lips into contact with his. The kiss ended when she gasped in excitement as he planted his feet on the bed and bucked upward. He moved his hand from their joining to her waist as he thrust upward each time she came down. Soon he was using both hands to bring her down harder on him.

真嗣抬头望向明日香的脸庞，她加快了爱抚的节奏。她眼中充满狂野的激情与渴望，令他兴奋不已。她依旧带着笑容，身体不减速度地下降，将双唇贴上他的。当她因他双脚蹬床、向上猛挺而兴奋地喘息时，这个吻结束了。他把手从两人结合处移到她的腰间，每当她下压时，他便向上挺进。很快，他用双手将她更用力地压向自己。

A whimper escaped her lips as she drove herself down on Shinji, feeling him penetrate her deeper. Still she didn’t slow, feeling the pleasure and excitement building in her body, the telltale signs of an approaching climax. Instead she came down on him faster, feeling him respond to her desire, bucking harder and faster as his own end neared. She felt him thrusting into her as deep as possible before withdrawing, only to feel him inside her again and again. Time seemed to have slowed as she lost track of how long they had been joined.

随着她对真嗣的深入，一声呜咽从她唇间逸出。她并未放慢速度，体内的快感与兴奋不断累积，预示着高潮即将来临。她反而加快了下压的速度，感受到他对她欲望的回应，他愈发猛烈和迅速地向上挺动，自己的终点也近在咫尺。她感觉到他一次次深深地插入，然后抽出，再次进入她的身体。时间仿佛放慢了脚步，她已记不清他们结合了多久。

Shinji barely heard Asuka scream in ecstasy as she reached her orgasm, lost in his own. His voice caught in his throat as he thrust up into her body one more time; his back arched and hips locked. He could feel himself pulsing inside of her as her walls clenched at his manhood tightly. A groan escaped his lips as he felt her whole body trembling in pleasure. Opening his eyes, he watched Asuka’s head snap back, her mouth open in excitement while her hair formed a halo around her. Surprise filled him as she fell forward, gently landing on him. As their orgasms faded he slid an arm around her shoulders. At his touch she lifted her head and gave him a small smile.

真嗣几乎没听见明日香在达到高潮时的尖叫，他自己也沉浸其中。他的声音卡在喉咙里，再次向上挺身进入她的身体；他的背弓起，臀部紧绷。他能感觉到自己在她体内脉动，她的内壁紧紧夹住他的阳刚。一声呻吟从他唇间逸出，他感觉到她整个身体因快感而颤抖。睁开眼，他看到明日香的头猛地后仰，嘴巴张开，兴奋不已，头发在她周围形成一个光环。她突然向前倒下，轻轻落在他身上，让他惊讶。随着高潮的消退，他伸手环抱住她的肩膀。他的触碰让她抬起头，给了他一个浅浅的微笑。

“Thank you,” she said quietly.

“谢谢你，”她轻声说道。

“You’re welcome.” He softly kissed her head before laying back. Staring up at the ceiling he thought about their recent activities.

“不客气。”他轻吻了她的额头，然后躺下。仰望着天花板，他回想起他们最近的活动。

“What’s so funny?” Asuka asked hearing him chuckle a few minutes later.

“什么这么好笑？”几分钟后听到他轻笑，明日香问道。

“Nothing.”

“Is that so?” She pressed her nails into his skin, getting him to grimace. “Don’t make me have to drag it out of you.”

“是吗？”她用指甲压进他的皮肤，让他不禁皱眉。“别逼我非得逼你说出来。”

Shinji smiled. “Just thinking of what Kensuke and Touji would do if they saw us.” He looked down at her groan. “What?”

真嗣微笑着说：“只是想到如果健介和彻看到我们，他们会怎么做。”他低头看着她呻吟。“怎么了？”

“You have me, your soul mate and lover here and all you can think about is the Stooges.” She pouted. “Idiot.”

“你有我，你的灵魂伴侣和爱人在这里，而你满脑子想的都是那三个傻瓜。”她噘起嘴。“傻瓜。”

“It’s not like that!” He held her close. “Nothing will ever make me forget what we’ve done. The pleasure of your…”

“不是那样的！”他紧紧抱住她。“没有什么能让我忘记我们所做的一切。你的快乐……”

“So you finally realized sex is fun?” Her smirk grew at his nod. “It’s about time. I thought you’d never admit to liking the physical pleasure.”

“所以你终于意识到性是愉快的了？”她看到他点头，笑容更甚。“真是时候了。我还以为你永远不会承认喜欢这种肉体上的快感呢。”

“That’s not a problem,” he muttered. “Nothing compares to making love with you.”

“那不是问题，”他低声说，“没有什么能比得上与你亲热。”

“Then why are you thinking of the Stooges?” Her hand slid down his torso. “If you’re so rested, we could…”

“那你为什么在想那些滑稽的家伙？”她的手滑过他的胸膛，“如果你这么精神，我们可以……”

“No.”

“I was just joking.” She placed her head on his chest. “Still you want to know what your two friends would be doing? Kensuke would be taking pictures and Touji would be shrieking in horror.”

“我只是在开玩笑。”她把头靠在他的胸口。“不过你还是想知道你的两个朋友会做什么吗？健介会拍照，而冬二会吓得尖叫。”

“Probably, though that’s not what I was thinking about,” he answered smiling.

“可能吧，但那不是我在想的，”他笑着回答。

“Hurry up and tell me before I fall asleep,” she said, smothering a yawn.

“快点告诉我，不然我就要睡着了，”她说着，强忍住一个哈欠。

“They’d just be surprised to see this side of you.” He looked up at the ceiling. “The calm, gentle woman who loves me. All they’ve ever known is the tough exterior; the one who would never admit to wanting anyone, much less make love to that…” He trailed off as she squeezed him.

“他们要是看到你这一面，肯定会大吃一惊。”他抬头望向天花板。“那个温柔、平和、爱我的女人。他们所了解的，只是你坚强的外表；那个从不承认需要任何人，更别说与那人……”他话没说完，她便紧紧地抱住了他。

“And they will never know that side of me. I know I can be nice with you, show the other side of me because you’ll never hurt me. That can’t be said of others.” She looked up at him. “I love you and only you. No one else matters.”

“他们永远不会了解我那一面。我知道我可以对你好，展现我的另一面，因为你永远不会伤害我。其他人就不好说了。”她抬头望着他，“我爱你，只爱你一个。其他人都不重要。”

Four days later 四天后

“What’s the matter?” “怎么了？”

Shinji turned from the window as Asuka came to stand next to him, resting her head on his shoulder. He was somewhat disappointed at her casual attire; all her dresses had been packed away. Their hands brushed against each other before curling each of their fingers around the other. A sigh of contentment came from the both of them as they stood there silently.

当明日香走过来站在他身边，将头靠在他肩上时，真嗣从窗边转过身来。他对她随意的着装有些失望；她所有的裙子都已打包收好。他们的手轻轻触碰后，彼此的手指缠绕在一起。两人站在那里，默默地发出满足的叹息。

“So are you going to answer the question?” she asked quietly.

“那么，你打算回答这个问题吗？”她轻声问道。

“I’m just going to miss this place. We made some good memories these last ten days.”

我只是会想念这个地方。这十天里，我们留下了许多美好的回忆。

Asuka smiled. “Yeah, but Kyoto and Tokyo-3 hold a lot more.”

明日香微笑着说：“是的，但京都和第三新东京市承载得更多。”

“Not all of them are happy ones, though.”

“不过，并非所有的记忆都是美好的。”

“We can keep making those happy memories until they outnumber the bad ones.” She broke their contact and moved in front of him, staring into his eyes. “That’s all I want from now on, Shinji; happy memories.”

“我们可以继续创造那些快乐的记忆，直到它们比不好的记忆还要多。”她结束了与他的接触，走到他面前，凝视着他的眼睛。“这就是我今后想要的，真嗣；只有快乐的记忆。”

He pulled her closer, wrapping his arms around her and resting his chin on a small shoulder. “I promise I’ll do everything I can to make sure you only have good memories.” Shinji rocked and held onto Asuka for a few minutes, feeling her body heat radiating off her. “So how should we thank Misato for the trip?”

他把她拉近，双臂环绕着她，下巴轻轻搁在她的一个小肩膀上。“我保证，我会尽我所能，让你只留下美好的回忆。”真嗣轻轻摇晃着，紧抱着明日香几分钟，感受着她身上散发的热量。“那我们应该怎么感谢美里安排的这次旅行呢？”

“I don’t know but it’ll have to be something special.” She trembled as a hand rubbed her stomach.

“我不知道，但必须得是特别的东西。”她颤抖着，一只手抚摸着她的肚子。

“Grandkids?”

“Not yet.”

He wrapped his arms around her waist. “Are you sure? We didn’t exactly use any protection.”

他双臂环抱住她的腰。“你确定吗？我们并没有采取任何保护措施。”

“Idiot!” Asuka laughed, feeling him tense. “Just because you weren’t protected doesn’t mean I wasn’t.”

“傻瓜！”明日香笑着说，感觉到他紧张起来。“你没被保护，不代表我也没有。”

“Birth control?”

“Yes.” She kissed his cheek after her admission. “I love you, Shinji. More than anything else in the world, but like I said earlier I’m not ready for kids. Remember?”

“是的。”她承认后吻了他的脸颊，“我爱你，真嗣。比世界上任何事物都要爱，但就像我之前说的，我还没准备好要孩子。记得吗？”

“Yeah, I remember.” A ghost of a smile crossed his lips at the memory.

“是的，我记得。”一丝微笑掠过他的唇边，回忆涌上心头。

Asuka pulled him closer. “But back to your question. We could get Misato a card, thanking her for all she’s done for us.”

明日香将他拉近，“但回到你刚才的问题，我们可以给美里买张卡片，感谢她为我们所做的一切。”

“Asuka!” He paused at her wide smile.

“明日香！”他停下脚步，被她灿烂的笑容所吸引。

“Honestly though, I don’t think she is expecting anything. That our relationship is still going strong after so much trouble is probably enough for her.” The redhead sighed sadly. “After everything we put her through, us being happy is all she wants. The little arrogant girl who never wanted anybody and the shy quiet boy who didn’t want to get close to a person. No one would have expected us to get together and reach this stage but we’ve shown them.” She ran a hand up his back. “Despite our pasts, our fears and doubts we won.”

“老实说，我觉得她并没有期待什么。经历了那么多波折，我们的关系依然稳固，这对她来说或许已经足够了。”红发女子忧伤地叹了口气，“经历了我们给她带来的种种，我们能幸福就是她所愿。那个曾经目中无人、不愿与任何人亲近的小女孩，和那个害羞寡言、害怕与人亲近的男孩。没人会料到我们能走到一起，达到今天这一步，但我们证明了他们的错误。”她轻抚他的背，“尽管过去充满恐惧和疑虑，我们终究是赢了。”

They stood there silently thinking of those words and how true they were. So much had happened in the three years since she had woken up in the hospital. Tears had been shed in anger and sorrow while kisses and touches had been shared in happiness. Each had shown the other they were there for them, no matter the circumstances. Trust had been weakened before becoming stronger as they became closer. And most important was their love as it grew, slowly and steadily; showing each they no longer were alone, that they had someone who understood them.

他们静静地站在那里，思索着那些话语的真实性。自从她在医院醒来后的三年里，发生了太多事情。愤怒与悲伤中流过泪，幸福中分享过亲吻与抚触。彼此都表明了无论境遇如何，都会相互支持。信任曾一度动摇，但随着关系的加深，又变得更加坚固。最重要的是，他们的爱在缓慢而稳定地增长，向彼此证明他们不再孤单，找到了理解自己的人。

Shinji brushed her hair over shoulder before lifting her chin with a finger. He smiled sadly at her eyes; that were happy and sad.

真嗣将她的头发拂至肩后，用手指轻轻托起她的下巴。他对着她那既快乐又悲伤的眼睛，露出了悲伤的微笑。

“We won didn’t we?”

“Yes.”

A/N:

Well thanks are in order for my pre-readers for staying with this project, even if at times they seemed like slave drivers. Special thanks goes out to Weltall Elite for helping with this story over the last eight months. At times I’m sure he has wanted me just to finish it and get it out. Yet without him to bounce ideas off of, things wouldn’t have gone so well and I might have stopped. We’ve had long discussions concerning Asuka/Shinji in a relationship and how it would develop. You could say this story is much his as mine though I did all the writing. Thanks also goes out to Alnilam and Jeff Alan for not throwing up their hands up in anger or disgust when they had to correct all my technical errors. Without them, the story would be a mess and wouldn’t flow properly. I just hope Alnilam doesn’t think I’m too perverted.

首先，感谢我的预读者们一直陪伴着这个项目，尽管有时他们似乎像监工一样。特别感谢 Weltall Elite 在过去八个月中对故事的帮助。我确信，他有时一定希望我能快点完成并发布。然而，没有他作为我交流想法的对象，事情不会进展得如此顺利，我可能早已放弃。我们曾就明日香与真嗣的恋爱关系及其发展进行了深入讨论。可以说，这个故事既是我的，也是他的，尽管所有的文字都是我写的。同样感谢 Alnilam 和 Jeff Alan，他们在纠正我所有技术错误时，没有愤怒或厌恶地举手投降。没有他们，故事将是一团糟，无法流畅进行。我只希望 Alnilam 不会觉得我太过分。

Well the sex scenes were the hardest things to write and not for the obvious reasons. I was burned out at the time I wrote them from work and family so hopefully they turned out properly. Also I was determined not to use any slang to describe their bodies or acts, which is very hard. I aimed for physical description because sex is a physical act. And the way to present a physical act is to describe it. Don’t worry in the following parts the detail will go down since everything has been established here. Also I aimed for more emotion before and after the sex for various reasons. I hope I succeeded.

性爱场景的描写最为艰难，并非出于显而易见的原因。当时我因工作和家庭事务精疲力尽，写这些部分时，只愿它们能恰如其分。我坚决避免使用任何俚语来描绘他们的身体或行为，这实属不易。我力求通过身体描述来呈现性行为，因为性本身就是一种身体活动，而展现身体活动的途径便是细致描绘。放心，后续章节的细节会减少，因为此处已奠定基础。此外，我试图在性行为前后注入更多情感，出于多种考量。希望我已达成所愿。

Long and slow is how I see a relationship between Asuka and Shinji before they even think about sex. Sex is something neither will jump into immediately because it is too easy to get hurt. The number of times they have either been hurt or betrayed by those they loved is going to make them cautious. They are going to make sure they love each other and won’t be abandoned after doing something so serious. And it would be a serious act to them despite what many say. They’re not going to treat it casually because it would be their way of saying they completely trust each other, that they love each other. It would be lowering that last wall, the last defense and it will not come easily. Or that’s my opinion at least.

在我看来，明日香和真嗣之间的关系是缓慢而长久的，他们在考虑性之前就是如此。性对他们来说不是会立刻投入的事情，因为太容易受伤了。他们被所爱之人伤害或背叛的次数，使得他们变得谨慎。他们会确保彼此相爱，且不会在做出如此严肃的事情后被抛弃。尽管许多人怎么说，这对他们来说将是一件严肃的事。他们不会轻率对待，因为这是他们表达完全信任和爱对方的方式。这将意味着拆除最后一道墙，最后的防线，而这不会轻易发生。至少这是我的看法。
