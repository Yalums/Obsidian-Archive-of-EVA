Asuka is rougher than usual in one of their daily fights. Mari has to find out why. MarixAsuka
明日香在日常的争吵中比平时更加粗暴。真里必须找出原因。

_* Author's Note: I'm shocked at the surge of response I got from that first story I posted on tumblr. Here's another I started and then got lazy towards the end, there may be a sequel to the first story I posted of them.  
* 作者的话：我对在 Tumblr 上发布的第一篇故事所获得的强烈反响感到震惊。这是另一篇我开了头却因懒惰而草草收尾的作品，或许会有关于他们第一篇故事的续集。_

_This is dedicated to the anon who left a review on Refuse to Accept who thinks MarixAsuka is bandwagon trash.  
这是献给那位在‘拒绝接受’上留下评论的匿名者，他认为 MarixAsuka 是随大流的垃圾。_

"Being extra rough today aren't you princess?"  
“今天特别粗暴啊，公主？”

"Shut the fuck up." “闭嘴。”

They were rolling around, having ended up on the floor in one of their usual tussling sessions. It always seemed to happen right after a training session. Mari would do something that would annoy Asuka or in some extreme cases cause her to start cursing in German in low utterances during the entire hour they were training in their EVAs.  
他们滚作一团，又一次在训练后的常规打闹中摔到了地上。这种情况总是在训练结束后不久发生。真希总是会做出些惹恼明日香的事情，或者在极端情况下，让她在整个 EVA 训练的一个小时里低声用德语咒骂。

It seemed to be much worse today though since strangely Asuka had remained completely quiet during the entire time of training. Mari was worried (only a _little_) that she might've actually crossed the line for once. Well she normally did, but usually it wasn't anything that Asuka wouldn't just curse her out later on for, and they'd move onto the next fight without issue.  
但今天似乎格外严重，因为奇怪的是明日香在整个训练过程中完全保持沉默。真希有点担心（只是有点）自己这次可能真的越界了。虽然她通常都会越界，但通常明日香只会事后咒骂她一顿，然后他们就会毫无问题地进入下一场战斗。

Today though, Asuka had not only taken to tackling her to the floor once they returned to their quarters, but she had also taken to grabbing at her in a rougher manner than usual. Mari had to respond, gripping onto the woman who was just slightly shorter and smaller than herself. They'd ended up rolling over near the glass door that led to the balcony outside.  
然而今天，明日香不仅在他们回到房间后将她扑倒在地，而且她抓她的方式也比平时更粗暴。真里不得不回应，抓住那个比自己稍矮小一点的女人。她们最终滚到了通往阳台的玻璃门旁。

Asuka sat on top of her, the sound of her breathing heard as she exhaled through her nose, her mouth staying firmly shut. Having grabbed at the woman's hands, she pinned them on the floor somewhat above her head, staring down at her with her right eye.  
明日香坐在她身上，通过鼻子呼气的声音清晰可闻，她的嘴紧闭着。她抓住了对方的手，将它们按在地板上，略高于她的头部，用右眼凝视着她。

"As much as I enjoy our little fights, are you going to keep up with this or are you going to tell me what's wrong with you?"  
“尽管我很享受我们的这些小打斗，你是打算继续这样，还是告诉我你到底怎么了？”

Her being stubbornly silent wasn't surprising to Mari. With a sigh she tilted her head to the side, trying to think of just what might have put the other into such a state. Clearly she wasn't going to give up what was really wrong with her, which wasn't really a surprise to her since she was like a spoiled princess after all. The only challenge was that she expected you to figure out what the problem was. She should've expected that from her out of anyone.  
她固执地保持沉默并不让玛丽感到意外。她叹了口气，歪着头，试图思考究竟是什么让对方陷入了这样的状态。显然，她不会透露真正的问题所在，这并不出乎玛丽的意料，毕竟她毕竟像个被宠坏的公主。唯一的挑战是她期望你能猜出问题所在。她本该从她那里预料到这一点。

"I'll take that as a no." She muttered mostly to herself, still feeling that blue eye staring at her. Remaining in her pinned down state; she let her thoughts drift back to the past day or two. She could recall how the woman had been her normal self during the training session yesterday. So it had to of been something that happened after that.  
“我猜这就是个‘不’了。”她喃喃自语，仍然感觉到那只蓝眼睛盯着她。保持被压制的状态，她让自己的思绪飘回到过去的一两天。她记得昨天训练时那个女人还一切正常。所以问题一定是那之后发生的。

Replaying the events from that afternoon to evening, the only thing that seemed to stand out was how Sakura had asked her to have dinner with her. She had mentioned something about not having seen her for a while, so yeah she agreed. What was the harm in dinner with a friend? Besides the girl was pretty cute and sweet, but getting back on track it was then that Mari realized that _had_ to of been it. Otherwise she had just gone to bed alone, well rather late seeing as they ended up talking for a long time out on the front deck of the ship.  
回想起那天从下午到晚上的种种，唯一让人印象深刻的是樱邀请她共进晚餐。樱提到已经有一段时间没见面了，所以她欣然同意。与朋友共进晚餐有何不可呢？况且樱既可爱又甜美，不过回到正题，那时玛丽意识到这应该就是全部了。否则她只会独自上床睡觉，而且相当晚，毕竟她们在船的前甲板上聊了很久。

"It's Sakura isn't it?" “是樱，对吧？”

The grip on her arms tightened in that moment. Letting her gaze move back to stare up at her again, she kept her voice in its normal tone, still feeling somewhat amused at what this all meant.  
那一刻，手臂上的握力加重了。她将目光移回，再次抬头凝视着对方，保持平常的语调，心中仍对这一切的意义感到几分好笑。

"You're mad because I went out with her last night?"  
"你生气是因为我昨晚和她出去了？"

Asuka said nothing as she released the grip on her arms, starting to move up off of her to stand up and head towards the door.  
明日香一言不发，松开了抓着她手臂的手，开始起身离开她，走向门口。

"I don't see why, all we did was have dinner and talk."  
"我不明白为什么，我们只是吃了顿饭，聊了聊天。"

Stopping at the door, Asuka finally spoke again in that low, harsh tone she had when she was severely pissed off about something.  
在门口停下脚步，明日香终于再次开口，用那种低沉而严厉的语气，显然是对某件事极度恼火。

"Sure as hell didn't look like that from where I was standing."  
“从我站的地方看，绝对不是那样。”

Sitting up from off the ground, Mari started to stand up, her jeans resting back on her hips properly as she stood there with an amused expression on her face.  
玛丽从地上坐起来，开始站起来，她的牛仔裤恰当地回到了腰间，她站在那里，脸上带着一抹戏谑的微笑。

"So you were following us?"  
"所以你一直在跟踪我们？"

"Not following. You just never came back to your room at the time you normally do."  
"不是跟踪。只是你一直没有在平时的时间回到房间。"

"So you were **_stalking_** me."  
"那你就是在监视我了。"

Asuka made a sound almost similar to a '_tch_' as she started moving to hit the button for the door to open.  
明日香发出一声近乎'啧'的声响，随即开始移动去按开门按钮。

"Doesn't matter. Do whatever the fuck you want."  
“无所谓。你爱干嘛干嘛。”

Mari moved before she could even completely press her palm onto the button.  
在明日香还没完全按下按钮之前，真希波就已经抢先一步行动了。

Her own hand reaching the keypad, she swiftly pressed the code to lock the door instead, grabbing onto the woman's shoulders to force her back onto the bed nearby as she crawled on top of her.  
她自己的手伸向键盘，迅速按下密码锁门，同时抓住女人的肩膀，将她强行按倒在旁边的床上，随即爬到她身上。

Asuka had barely had enough time to register what had happened. Seeing how she had ended up on the bed, the weight from the other woman shift onto her, and she forced herself to look away just before starting to try and move away.  
明日香几乎还没来得及反应发生了什么。看到自己怎么就躺在了床上，另一个女人的体重压了上来，她强迫自己移开视线，就在开始试图挪动身体之前。

Mari never allowed her that chance either, pressing her hands onto her shoulders again to keep her pressed down against the bed. "No, you're not going anywhere."  
玛丽也不给她任何机会，再次将双手按在她的肩膀上，让她紧贴着床。“不，你哪儿也别想去。”

"Cut this shit out four-eyes-"  
“别再搞这些花样了，四眼——”

"You started it." “是你先挑起的。”

"Yeah because, you know what why don't you just go and get Sakura to do this with instead?"  
“是啊，你知道吗，为什么不直接去找樱来一起做这件事呢？”

"**No**." "不。"

The reply was simple, but Asuka never took simple answers.  
回答很简单，但明日香从不接受简单的答案。

"What do you mean _no_?" She stated the questions almost as a demanding for an explanation.  
"你说的‘不’是什么意思？" 她几乎是以要求解释的口吻提出这个问题。

"I'd much rather have you here." Mari leaned in, muttering hotly against her neck. "I've always wanted you here…ever since the first day I met you, of course you were always too busy yelling at me to notice."  
"我更希望你在这里。" 玛丽靠过来，热切地在她脖子上低语。"我一直希望你在这里……自从我第一次遇见你那天起，当然你总是忙着对我大喊大叫，没注意到。"

"What-you're lying." "什么——你在撒谎。"

Leaning back enough to stare at her, Asuka felt her heart actively stop as she saw the seriousness in blue eyes. It was a look that she rarely ever saw.  
Asuka 向后仰去，足以凝视着她，当她看到那双蓝眼睛中的严肃时，她的心跳仿佛骤然停止。这是一种她极少见到的神情。

"I'd never lie to my princess." Mari spoke in a whisper before tilting her head down, pressing a soft kiss over the woman's lips.  
“我绝不会对我的公主撒谎。”玛丽低语着，然后轻轻低下头，温柔地吻上了女人的唇。

Asuka was shocked, unable to do anything for the first few seconds. Upon realizing that Mari was kissing her, she felt any fight she had left in her completely disappear. For once she didn't want to fight with her; she just wanted to be with her.  
Asuka 震惊不已，最初几秒内什么也做不了。意识到玛丽正在吻她，她感到自己仅存的那点斗志彻底消失了。这一次，她不想与她争吵；她只想与她在一起。

With a noise of approval, Mari moved her hands down to wander over the slim figure beneath her, taking to pushing at the red tank top resting on her chest. Humming in satisfaction with how it felt to have her skin on her fingertips, she licked at her lips, making Asuka part her lips to actually make the kiss deeper.  
玛丽满意地哼了一声，双手向下游移，探索着身下纤细的身躯，开始推挤着压在胸前的红色坦克背心。指尖触感让她心满意足，她舔了舔嘴唇，使得明日香张开双唇，加深了这个吻。

Asuka had taken to shifting her knee up between Mari's legs, letting it rub up between her legs which caused a noise to be heard in the kiss that she found pleasing to her senses. She'd always wondered what all she would have to do to make Mari weak, it was always nice knowing more weaknesses she could use on her later on.  
明日香则开始将膝盖移到玛丽双腿之间，让它在她双腿间摩擦，这使得接吻中传来一声令她感到愉悦的声响。她一直想知道要让玛丽变得软弱需要做些什么，现在能发现更多可以利用的弱点总是件好事。

Mari only seemed to retaliate though by gripping underneath the fabric of what felt to be a lace bra. Taking a breast firmly in her hand, she groped and let her fingers rub at the nipple to make Asuka almost gasp into her mouth. The kiss was broken for a second only to be reinitiated again in a rougher manner, Mari pushing herself against the knee that was brushing up against her as her hand still teased at the perky breasts in her grasp.  
玛丽似乎只是通过抓住感觉像是蕾丝胸罩的布料来反击。她紧紧握住一只乳房，揉捏着，并用手指摩擦乳头，让明日香几乎在她的嘴里喘息。这个吻只中断了一秒钟，随即以更粗暴的方式重新开始，玛丽将自己推向那只仍在她手中挑逗着挺拔乳房的膝盖。

Their tongues licked and ran together, the battle from earlier seemingly restarting again as they bit and nipped in between as well. Asuka moaned uneasily, the kiss breaking as Mari took to biting at her neck, pushing down the knee that had been torturing her and moving her hands down to undo the black jeans on the woman's small frame.  
他们的舌头交缠舔舐，先前的争斗仿佛再度重启，间或轻咬啮咬。明日香不安地呻吟着，吻被中断，真希波开始咬啮她的脖颈，压下那折磨她的膝盖，双手向下探去，解开女人娇小身躯上的黑色牛仔裤。

"I didn't do this with Sakura last night did I?"  
“昨晚我没和樱做这事，对吧？”

"Why do you have to mention that right now?" Asuka almost growled out as she felt her frustration at an all-time high. She certainly didn't want to hear about Mari's date or night out or whatever it was, not when she felt her pants being unzipped by her.  
“你干嘛非得现在提这个？”明日香几乎咆哮道，她感到自己的挫败感达到了前所未有的高度。她当然不想听到关于真梨的约会或夜出之类的任何事，尤其在她感觉到自己的裤子被她拉链拉开的时候。

"Just stating fact. She grabbed my hand, but I believe I'm grabbing something else belonging to someone else right now." Mari smirked against her neck as she then leaned her head up, wanting to see her expression as she unzipped the jeans and ran her hand down into the white panties that had been hiding what she wanted.  
"只是陈述事实。她抓住了我的手，但我想我现在正握着属于别人的某样东西。" 玛丽在她脖颈间轻笑，随即抬起头，渴望看到她的表情，当她拉开牛仔裤拉链，手指探入那隐藏着她渴望之物的白色内裤时。

Asuka clutched at the sheets, feeling her hips jerk as she felt fingers brushing at her clit and then forcing themselves inside of her.  
明日香紧紧抓住床单，感觉到自己的臀部随着手指轻拂她的阴蒂，然后强行进入她的体内而猛地一颤。

Tilting her head down, she spoke against the side of her mouth as she let her thumb coat with a bit of wetness before rubbing at her clit. "You feel and taste as delicious as I thought you always would."  
她低下头，对着她的嘴角说话，同时用沾了些湿润的拇指摩擦她的阴蒂。“你感觉和味道都如我想象中一样美妙。”

With an uneasy gasp turned to a moan, Asuka moved a hand to latch onto the brunette's side, gripping tightly as she felt the fingers pushing deeper into her.  
随着不安的喘息转为呻吟，明日香伸手紧紧抓住了棕发女孩的侧身，感觉到对方的指尖正深入自己体内。

"I want you." Her voice was rougher than usual from how the pleasure was already coursing through her.  
"我想要你。" 她的声音因快感涌动而比平时更为沙哑。

"You have me." "你拥有我。"

"No, I _want_ you." “不，我想要你。”

Asuka gave her an almost dangerous gaze which made Mari lick her lips.  
明日香投来一个近乎危险的目光，让玛丽不禁舔了舔嘴唇。

"What makes you think I can do such things?"  
"你怎么会认为我能做这样的事？"

"Stalking includes going through all of your things."  
"跟踪包括翻遍你所有的东西。"

"If that's the case, then you need to be punished for that."  
"如果是那样的话，那你需要为此受到惩罚。"

"I thought I was a princess?"  
"我以为我是公主呢？"

Mari leaned back, a smirk taking over her lips entirely.  
玛丽向后靠去，嘴角完全被一抹得意的笑容占据。

"Even princesses can commit treason."  
"即使是公主，也能犯下叛国之罪。"

_~ fin. ~ 完。_
