### Chapter 1

_The feel of cold wind against my skin.  
冷风拂面的感觉。_

_The loud sound of raindrops as they hit the ground.  
雨滴重重砸在地上的响声。_

_Time seemed to slow down and everything went blurry.  
时间仿佛慢了下来，一切变得模糊不清。_

_I didn't know what I was thinking back then.  
那时我真不知道自己在想些什么。_

_My filthy feet continuously hit the ground.  
我那肮脏的双脚不停地踏在地面上。_

_I ran having no second thoughts, coated with only pajamas, bared feet and the crazy loud thumping of my heart beat.  
我毫不犹豫地奔跑着，只穿着睡衣，赤着脚，心中那疯狂而响亮的跳动声回荡不已。_

_I was holding it tightly, a letter soaking wet with his words washed out.  
我紧紧握着它，一封被他的字迹浸透的信，湿漉漉的。_

_That time, I wasn't thinking of all the possible outcomes of what I was about to do.  
那时，我并没有考虑即将要做的事情可能带来的所有后果。_

_I don't care if I look crap.  
我不在乎自己看起来有多糟糕。_

_That time, nothing really matters, all I wanted was to reach him.  
那一刻，世间万物皆无关紧要，我只想触碰到他。_

_And when I did, he gazed at me like he never did before.  
当我终于做到时，他凝视我的眼神，是前所未有的深邃。_

_That moment felt like an eternity.  
那一瞬，仿佛跨越了永恒。_

_I couldn't contain myself.  
我无法抑制自己。_

_I held him tight as I locked his lips with mine.  
我紧紧抱住他，双唇紧锁他的唇。_

_It was bitter, salty... but sweet.  
那是苦涩的，咸的……但又甜美。_

_It was long, deep... but soothing.  
它漫长、深邃...却抚慰人心。_

_It was my first kiss... with my brother.  
那是我和哥哥的初吻。_

---

"I saw you." “我看见你了。”

I don't hate her but I don't like her either.  
我不讨厌她，但也不喜欢她。

I think we don't get along pretty well, we converse not so often.  
我觉得我们相处得不太好，交流也不多。

She makes me go nuts.  
她让我抓狂。

She isn't an annoyance but her presence disturbs me a lot.  
她并非惹人厌烦，但她的存在让我深感困扰。

Probably because... she's my brother's lover.  
或许是因为...她是我的嫂子。

Every single day that I see them together, that sight disgusts me.  
每当我看到他们在一起的情景，那画面令我作呕。

Not because I hate her, I really don't.  
并非因为我讨厌她，我真的不讨厌。

It's because I hate them... together.  
是因为我讨厌他们...在一起。

It may sound too hypocritical but that's my reality.  
这听起来可能过于虚伪，但这就是我的现实。

I love my brother, I really do and her, I don't give her that much attention but when they are together, it makes me sick to my stomach.  
我爱我的哥哥，真的，还有她，我并没有给予她太多关注，但当他们在一起时，我感到胃里一阵恶心。

I'm deeply aggravated... and still I couldn't take my eyes off them.  
我深感恼火……然而我还是无法将目光从他们身上移开。

"What did you see." “你看到了什么？”

My words were not that of a question, they're a statement boldly challenging her if she has the guts to tell me what she witnessed.  
我的话并非疑问，而是大胆的挑战，看她是否有胆量告诉我她所目睹的一切。

I know what she meant, I know what she saw, I know what she wanted.  
我明白她的意思，我知道她看到了什么，我知道她想要什么。

Say it.. if you could, if you would.  
说出来吧……如果你愿意，如果你敢。

Not a word, even a mere sound left her mouth.  
她一言不发，甚至连一丝声音都未曾发出。

We stood there, staring back into each other's orbs, gazes peeking through our very soul.  
我们站在那里，凝视着彼此的眼眸，目光穿透了灵魂深处。

We're both aware of what's happening and how chaotic some things turned out.  
我们都清楚正在发生什么，以及某些事情变得多么混乱。

If we could patch it up, that's something neither of us can do.  
如果我们能修补它，这是我们俩都无法做到的事。

It came to a point where we both know that we were doing nasty schemes, idiotic schemes... yet neither of us cared.  
到了一个地步，我们俩都知道自己在搞些卑鄙的、愚蠢的计划……然而我们谁也不在乎。

Not even my brother. 甚至我哥哥也不例外。

"You know what it was, stop playing dumb."  
"你知道那是什么，别装傻了。"

---

You're no different, was what I thought.  
我以为你也没什么不同。

It doesn't matter who's dumber, we both are, or she was, and I am.  
谁更笨不重要，我们都一样，或者她曾经是，而我如今是。

She first broke eye contact and turned to get her coat.  
她首先移开了目光，转身去拿她的外套。

She isn't staying for the night even though there was heavy pouring rain.  
尽管外面大雨倾盆，她并不打算留宿。

My eyes were fixed at the sight of her back as she busily puts on her boots.  
我的目光紧随着她忙碌地穿上靴子的背影。

I wasn't mad, not even irritated in the slightest but... there's a weird feeling welling up inside me and it's a bit... painful, I guess.  
我并没有生气，甚至一点儿也不烦躁，但...心里涌起一种奇怪的感觉，有点...痛苦吧，我想。

I caught a glimpse of her face while she was grabbing an umbrella and I don't know, at some point my breathing got heavy.  
她在拿伞时我瞥见了她的脸，不知怎么的，我的呼吸变得沉重起来。

"I am sorry." "我很抱歉。"

i wasn't waiting for a response, I wasn't expecting any.  
我并没有在等待回复，也没有期待任何回应。

"Don't say things you don't actually mean. We've been way too pretentious for a long time. Don't you think it's about time we stop spitting lies in the others faces."  
“不要说那些你并不真心的话。我们长期以来都太过矫情了。你不觉得是时候该停止向他人脸上吐露谎言了吗？”

Are what she was supposed to tell me but they're all in my head.  
本是她该告诉我的，但这些话已全在我脑海中。

Maybe she didn't really hear what I said, or she just completely ignored me.  
或许她并未真正听清我的话，或者她完全忽视了我。

She left, not saying a word.  
她一言不发地离开了。

The door clicked and I was alone in the hallway unable to move a part of my body.  
门咔嗒一声关上，我独自站在走廊里，身体的一部分动弹不得。

The loud silence together with the sound of rain enveloped me.  
那响亮的寂静连同雨声一起将我包围。

---

"Hey... Do you think... Do time machines really exist? Mm, mm.. No, not that. Is there.. such a thing that could change things according to what I really wanted? Or, are there genies in this world? They could grant wishes, right?"  
“嘿...你觉得...时光机真的存在吗？嗯，嗯..不是那个。有没有...那种能按照我真正想要的改变事情的东西？或者，这个世界上有精灵吗？它们能实现愿望，对吧？”

His room feels different since the last time I set foot in here.  
自从上次我踏进这里以来，他的房间感觉不一样了。

I looked around, it was the same room after all, his things were in the exact same places, the smell wasn't anything new either, but... it still, it felt like a whole different place.  
我环顾四周，毕竟还是那个房间，他的东西依旧摆在原处，气味也并无新意，但...这里依然，感觉像是完全不同的地方。

Also the sleeping form before me remained the same, and what I feel inside didn't change, too.  
同样，躺在我面前的睡姿依旧如故，我内心的感受也未曾改变。

I fell down on the side of his bed and lay my head not far from his.  
我跌坐在他床边，将头靠在他不远处。

My mind went blank momentarily, I just watched him resting, wearing a soft look on his face, and no, he doesn't look like a baby.  
我的思绪瞬间空白，只是静静地看着他休息，脸上带着柔和的表情，不，他看起来并不像个婴儿。

Those long lashes, the lines on his jaw and lips, his steady breathing... watching him like this calms me.  
那长长的睫毛，他下巴和唇上的线条，还有他平稳的呼吸……这样看着他让我感到平静。

I caressed a few strands of his hair, traced a short line on the side of his face.  
我轻抚着他几缕发丝，在他脸颊一侧勾勒出短短的线条。

"We are always this close... and I wanted to do a lot of things... I could, but I must not, and that.. it sucks. You're within reach... but if I selfishly do this and that, it might hurt me, it hurts me. Not just me, not just you. And its all because I started playing this game. A crazy game called reality."  
我们总是如此亲近...而我曾想做许多事...我可以，但我不能，那...真是糟糕透顶。你近在咫尺...但如果我自私地这么做，那么做，可能会伤害到我，也会伤害到我。不只是我，也不只是你。这一切都是因为我开始玩这个游戏。一个名为现实的疯狂游戏。

Those were what I've always wanted to tell him, even though its only to his sleeping form.  
这些话，我一直想告诉他，尽管只是对着他沉睡的模样。

I wonder if the rain decided to creeped inside his room, because the moment I closed my eyes and my body succumbed to weariness, a few drops hit my cheek.  
不知是否雨水悄悄潜入了他的房间，就在我闭上眼，身体屈服于疲惫的那一刻，几滴雨点落在了我的脸颊上。  
It trailed down, to my lips, it tasted salty, really salty.  
它顺着滑落，触到我的唇，尝起来咸咸的，真的很咸。

---

"Rei." "丽。"

My whole body feels warm.  
我的全身都感到温暖。

I could still hear the sound of the rain and I know that I should be feeling frozen cold right now but I really feel warm and... happy, and guarded.  
我仍能听到雨声，我知道我现在应该感到冰冷刺骨，但我真的感觉温暖，而且……快乐，被守护着。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

I don't need to open my eyes to know who called out my name, I recognized it right away.  
我无需睁眼便知是谁呼唤了我的名字，我立刻就认出了那个声音。

I'm also in his room so, there's no doubt its him.  
我也在他的房间里，所以毫无疑问是他。

"Why did you end up in my room? Did you have a strange dream again?"  
"你怎么跑到我房间来了？又做了什么奇怪的梦吗？"

I shook my head, inhaling his scent and enjoying the rare moment that we share when his phone rang.  
我摇了摇头，深吸着他身上的气息，享受着这难得的共享时刻，直到他的手机铃声响起。

"Hello. Yes. What? How did that happen? Okay. I'll be right there."  
"喂。是的。什么？怎么会这样？好吧。我马上过去。"

It was her. Its always her. Why.  
就是她。总是她。为什么。

"Rei, I'm going out for a bit. It's Asuka, she's in the hospital right now."  
丽，我出去一下。是明日香，她现在在医院。

I quickly sat up, out of his bed and walked right behind him.  
我迅速坐起身，离开他的床，径直走到他身后。

I clutched the hem of the back of his shirt, tightly.  
我紧紧抓住他衬衫的后摆。

"Don- Take care." “唐——保重。”

I lightly pushed him passed the half opened door, closed and locked it, and sunk to my knees.  
我轻轻推他穿过半开的门，关上并锁好，然后跪倒在地。

I say things even if I don't mean it.  
即使并非本意，我也会说出口。

I do things even if they are against my will.  
即使违背意愿，我也会去做。

That's simply because I know its the right thing to say, its the right thing to do.  
那只是因为我知道这是该说的话，这是该做的事。

But there are still that are inevitable, that even if I want to say, do and feel otherwise, they're still unavoided. Just like this pain I'm feeling inside me.  
但有些事情是不可避免的，即便我想说、想做、想感受不同，它们依然无法避免。就像我内心此刻感受到的痛楚。

Whatever I do, I can't just ignore it... As it continues to grow, eating me.. and crushing me...  
无论我做什么，我都无法忽视它...随着它不断增长，吞噬着我...并碾压着我...

Little.. by little. 一点...一点地。

**t.b.c. 待续。**

**A/N:** Rrr! This time, I decided to do something that is completely out of my comfort zone... To write a fic with Rei as my heroine. I honestly don't like Rei but I don't hate her either. [That line was... haha, familiar, right.] But I would like to try something different and if it'll work out. If you're totally against incest, which is obviously what this fic is about then I'm sorry, just stay away from this fic. This is going to be different from my usual writing style. I don't know what's gotten into me. haha. Oh well. Feel free to judge, tell me your thoughts regarding the fic. Thank you and let's all have a great day. ^_^ Laters.  
作者有话：呃！这次，我决定做一件完全超出我舒适区的事情……以丽为女主角写一篇同人文。老实说，我不太喜欢丽，但也不讨厌她。[那句话……哈哈，很熟悉吧。] 不过我想尝试点不同的，看看效果如何。如果你完全反对乱伦题材，这显然是本文的主题，那么抱歉，请远离这篇文。这将不同于我平时的写作风格。不知怎的，我就这么决定了。哈哈。算了。欢迎评判，告诉我你对这篇文的看法。谢谢大家，祝我们都有美好的一天。^_^ 回见。

### Chapter 2

_I have always been completely honest with myself.  
我向来对自己完全坦诚。_

_I never looked at my brother as merely a sibling.  
我从未将我的兄弟仅仅视为手足。_

_Yes, pretty twisted but these are my feelings and it is my choice to hold onto them.  
是的，相当扭曲，但这些是我的情感，我选择坚持它们。_

_I never realized how much I cared for him right before Asuka snatched him away.  
我从没意识到在明日香把他抢走之前，我有多在乎他。_

_I felt extremely betrayed when he told me about them.  
当他告诉我他们的事时，我感到极度背叛。_

_Is he doing this on purpose to stop something that hasn't been started yet.  
他这么做是故意的吗？为了阻止一件尚未开始的事情。_

_Actually, who am I deceiving, I already know the answer to my questions even before I asked those myself.  
实际上，我在欺骗谁呢，我甚至在问自己之前就已经知道答案了。_

_I've been watching you all my life and I may have overlooked various things but I'm not a complete idiot who will fool myself over and over, feeding with lies that you felt the same when it was served right before me, that bitter reality. I didn't take a bite but through seeing it alone makes me want to puke.  
我一生都在观察你，虽然可能忽略了许多事情，但我不是那种会一次又一次自欺欺人的傻瓜，用那些你同样感受过的谎言来喂养自己，当那苦涩的现实就摆在我面前时。我没有咬一口，但光是看到它就让我想吐。_

_I've been blinded by my own desires and failed to notice that we aren't the only ones in this world, in your world.  
我被自己的欲望蒙蔽了双眼，没有注意到我们并不是这个世界上，在你的世界里唯一的两个人。_

_I am simply doing what I know is the right thing for me, not the right thing in front of the eyes of the people who only knows what and how to judge.  
我只是在做我认为对自己正确的事，而不是在那些只知道如何评判的人眼前做正确的事。_

_But at the same time, I am considering your feelings because if not, I might've taken actions that are totally against the rule of society.  
但与此同时，我也在考虑你的感受，否则我可能会采取完全违背社会规则的行动。_

_I wanted to see you happy Shinji but I am deeply sorry because I truly wished for my own happiness, as well.  
我想看到你快乐，真嗣，但我也深感抱歉，因为我同样真心希望自己能幸福。_

_Other than that.. to hell who cares.  
除此之外...管他呢，谁在乎。_

---

"Do you hate me? Are you disgusted now that you know everything? Us, is this something not worth trying because you don't feel the same? Or, you're only escaping because you know that its dirty?"  
“你恨我吗？现在你知道了一切，是不是觉得我恶心？我们，是不是因为你的感觉不同，就不值得尝试？还是说，你只是在逃避，因为你明白这很肮脏？”

"Rei, stop. This is wrong. I'm your brother. What are you thinking?"  
“丽，停下来。这是不对的。我是你哥哥。你在想什么？”

"I am thinking... What would you do if I kill your lover."  
"我在想……如果我杀了你的爱人，你会怎么做。"

That was the first time he slapped me.  
那是他第一次打我。

The sound of skin hitting another skin echoed and that sudden action was beyond my expectation.  
皮肤撞击的声响回荡着，那突如其来的举动超出了我的预料。

"Don't drag her into this game of yours. Tell me, are you troubled by something? What is it, because I can't understand you at all."  
"别把她卷进你的这场游戏里。告诉我，你是不是有什么困扰？是什么事，因为我完全搞不懂你。"

"You don't have to. It's not that you can't, you just don't want to. I didn't mean it when I said I was having thoughts of killing her but the rest are true. You don't have to answer right away."  
"你不必这样。不是你做不到，只是你不想。我说想过杀她只是随口一说，但其他的都是真的。你不必立刻回答。"

He isn't looking directly at me, he's staring back at my eyes but they were blank.  
他没有直接看我，他回望着我的眼睛，但那眼神空洞无物。

I could feel it, my whole body started trembling, that sight of him frightened me, he never looked at me like that.  
我能感觉到，我的整个身体开始颤抖，他那样的眼神让我害怕，他从未那样看过我。

He gradually took small steps, kissed me goodnight, then he was out of my sight.  
他渐渐地迈出小步，吻别了我，随后便消失在我的视线之外。

It was a small gesture, a simple tradition between siblings.  
这只是一个小动作，兄弟姐妹间的一个简单传统。

I lightly touched my forehead, the spot where his lips just made in contact not so long ago, and unconsciously brought my fingers to my lips.  
我轻轻触碰额头，那里不久前还留有他的唇温，不自觉地将手指移至唇边。

That night, I felt an incredibly different pain for the first time.  
那一夜，我首次感受到了一种截然不同的痛楚。

A pain that continues to grow but.. I don't give a crap.  
痛楚不断加剧，但……我毫不在乎。

I'm willing to cross the borderline. I do know what lies beneath.  
我愿意跨越那条界线。我确实知道下面潜藏着什么。

I'm not prepared but I'll gladly accept whatever are the consequences.  
我虽未准备好，但我会欣然接受任何后果。

---

"What are you doing here?"  
“你在这里做什么？”

"We are classmates. I know what happened and I felt the need to pay you a visit somehow."  
我们是同学。我知道发生了什么，觉得有必要以某种方式来看望你。

No, she wasn't involved in a car accident and she didn't commit suicide.  
不，她没有遭遇车祸，也没有自杀。

Asuka fainted, fell on the stairs and sprained her right ankle.  
明日香晕倒了，从楼梯上摔下来，扭伤了右脚踝。

"And you're the girlfriend of my brother. Why didn't you include that? Speaking of which. I'll be completely honest with you and plainly ask you straight to the point, why did you do that?"  
“而且你是我哥哥的女朋友。为什么没提到这一点？话说回来，我会对你完全坦诚，直截了当地问你，你为什么要那么做？”

I thought she's going to hit the bull's eye but she's still a little hesitant after all.  
我以为她会正中红心，但毕竟还是有些犹豫。

"I kissed him because that's what I always wanted to do. I was holding back for a very long time and that night, I was at my limit."  
“我吻他是因为那是我一直想做的事。我忍了很久，那晚，我到了极限。”

It had began, you didn't initiate a move yet, I am wondering, how you are going to play this so-called game, just how my brother described it, Soryu-san.  
已经开始了，你还没出手，我在想，你要怎么玩这个所谓的游戏，就像我哥哥描述的那样，Soryu-san。

"Haha! Rei... Okay. This is... How should I... Damn. I didn't know what proper thing to say. You may be his half-sister but still.. Everyone knows you two are siblings and Shinji sees you as his sister. Only his sister. I'm totally confused. I didn't see this coming."  
"哈哈！丽...好吧。这真是...我该怎么...该死。我不知道该说什么才合适。你虽然是他的同父异母妹妹，但大家还是知道你们是兄妹，真嗣也一直把你当亲妹妹看待。只是他的妹妹。我完全糊涂了。没想到会这样。"

I didn't see you coming either.  
我也没料到你会来。

Both of us were pre-occupied inside our little universe that we completely ignored the smallest events that could greatly affect our lives.  
我们俩都沉浸在自己的小世界里，完全忽略了那些可能极大影响我们生活的小事。

"I love him." “我爱他。”

I already predicted what you're about to answer and you're mistaken, its not something you could understand right away and I think its something that you will never ever want to understand.  
我已经预料到你会怎么回答，你错了，这不是你立刻就能理解的事情，我想这是你永远都不想理解的事情。

"What are you stupid?" “你是不是傻？”

In life, if things don't go our way, we build a wall and shut ourselves behind that wall to avoid being wounded as much as possible.  
在生活中，如果事情不如我们所愿，我们会建起一堵墙，将自己封闭起来，尽可能避免受到伤害。

That wall covers our eyes, mind, heart to understanding endless possibilities and even if we do, we ignore it, simply because we know its beyond our beliefs.  
那堵墙蒙蔽了我们的双眼、心灵，让我们无法理解无尽的可能性，即便意识到了，我们也选择忽视，只因我们知道那超出了我们的信念。

I don't think people like that are stupid, its just how they want to live life.  
我认为那样的人并不愚蠢，只是他们选择的生活方式如此。

We see one side of something and we thought we know the entirety.  
我们只看到事物的一面，便以为已洞悉全貌。

"Yes. I think I am."  
“是的，我想我是。”

I bowed and bid my farewell.  
我鞠了一躬，告辞离去。

She had this sour look painted all over her face, an evident truth showing how she's totally against my confession.  
她脸上写满了厌恶的表情，明显地表明她完全反对我的告白。

"What did you really come for?"  
"你究竟是为了什么而来？"

"I think I told you what my real intentions are right from the start. You asked me about my brother first-"  
"我想我从一开始就告诉过你我的真实意图。是你先问起我哥哥的——"

"And you have the guts to call him your brother when you said filthy things-"  
"你居然有脸称他为兄弟，当你说出那些肮脏的话——"

"STOP." "停下。"

I didn't face her. 我没有面对她。

I don't know what I could've done if I did.  
我不知道如果我那样做了，我能做些什么。

I took a short but deepest breath.  
我深吸了一口短暂的气。

"You're no saint Soryu, I believe you have no rights to call what I feel for him filthy."  
"草薙，你也不是圣人，我认为你没有资格称我对他的感情为肮脏。"

"What the hell are you talking about."  
“你到底在说什么鬼话。”

"I know about Ryoji-san."  
"我知道关于凌司先生的事。"

It just came out of the blue.  
这突如其来，毫无预兆。

Though I couldn't see her with my ow eyes, I could feel her hatred growing on me.  
虽然我无法亲眼看见她，但我能感觉到她对我的恨意在不断加深。

"You piece of.. Are you threatening me? Is this blackmail to stay away from your, ahem. brother?"  
"你这个...你在威胁我吗？这是要我远离你的，呃，哥哥吗？"

A nurse peeped through the small opening of the door, excused herself as she appeared from the other side grabbing some of Asuka's attention.  
一名护士从小门的一角探出头来，她一边道歉一边从另一侧出现，吸引了明日香的注意。

She bowed and hesitantly smiled at me.  
她鞠了一躬，对我犹豫地笑了笑。

"I am not and no, it isn't. I'm just letting you know. And again, I only answered your question."  
我不是，也不是。我只是告诉你一声。再说一遍，我只是回答了你的问题。

I continued. 我继续说道。

I stepped out of the room having no regrets at all. Unhappy but composed.  
我毫无遗憾地走出了房间。虽不快乐，但心境平和。

If its easy to restrain myself from falling my brother, I would've done so, a long time ago.  
如果我能轻易克制住自己不坠入情网，兄弟，我早就这么做了，很久以前。

---

"Happy Birthday!" "生日快乐！"

I want you so bad that its killing me.  
我如此渴望你，以至于这让我快要疯了。

"I... wanted to apologize for my behavior. And.. and the things I said and did earlier."  
"我...想为我的行为道歉。还有...还有我之前说的和做的事。"

I could stare at you all day.  
我可以整天凝视着你。

"I could... dn't understand what's happening. You know you can tell me whatever's bugging you."  
"我...搞不懂现在是什么情况。你知道的，无论什么困扰你，都可以告诉我。"

I actually don't know what you're saying right now.  
我其实不太明白你现在的意思。

"Rei? Hey. Are you even listening to me?"  
"丽？嘿。你有在听我说话吗？"

We both blinked at the same time.  
我们同时眨了眨眼。

"Let's kiss." "我们接吻吧。"

Unconsciously, I mouthed those words.  
下意识地，我喃喃念出了那些话。

Words that were only meant to be heard by me.  
只应被我听见的私语。

I didn't ask. 我没问。

I didn't dare. 我不敢。

I said it casually like let's eat or let's go.  
我随口一说，就像说‘我们去吃饭’或‘我们走吧’那样。

He ran his fingers at my bangs, dipping them all the way to the top of my head, finally settling at the back.  
他轻抚我的刘海，指尖一路滑至头顶，最终停留在脑后。

I never averted my gaze and so did he.  
我从未移开视线，他亦如此。

Using his free hand, he grabbed my right arm, I didn't flinch.  
他用空着的那只手抓住了我的右臂，我没有退缩。

It was dark and I couldn't properly see his face but his heavy breathings were evident.  
四周昏暗，我看不清他的脸，但他的沉重呼吸声清晰可闻。

His the left hand dancing on the skin of my right arm, down, slowly, until it came to rest on the back of my hand.  
他的左手在我右臂上游走，缓缓向下，最终停在了我的手背上。

Noncholantly shutting my eyes as he bring his face on the crook of the right side of my neck.  
他将自己的脸埋在我右颈窝时，我漫不经心地闭上了眼睛。

Burying the tip of his nose, it just felt so... exhilarating.  
他用鼻尖轻触，那种感觉真是……令人兴奋。

What on earth is this man doing to me.  
这个男人到底对我做了什么。

I feel hot, absolutely hot, bloody crazy hot.  
我觉得热，绝对热，热得要命，疯狂的热。

He deliberately brought his nose from my neck to me ear, as he whispers at his lowest voice.  
他故意将鼻子从我的脖子移到耳边，用他最低沉的声音耳语。

"We can't be doing that when you have a high fever like this."  
“你发这么高的烧，我们不能做那事。”

"I'm..." "我……"

"Shhhhh." "嘘……"

It's a part disappointing.  
这有点令人失望。

I was wondering, if it wasn't for the fever, will he really do it.  
我在想，若不是因为发烧，他真的会这么做吗。

But the night is still young.  
但夜晚还早着呢。

The sheer fact that i'm going to spend it with my brother makes me delighted.  
光是能和我哥哥一起度过这件事，就让我感到无比高兴。

Call it strange, but here is my sanctuary.  
说来奇怪，但这里是我的避风港。

Right here, in his arms.  
就在这里，在他怀里。

**t.b.c. 待续。**

**A/N:** First of all thank you reviewers and readers. Yes, chapter two and I'm actually enjoying writing this one. Haha. [Not as much as writing an SxA fic, but still, who would've thought.] I'm kind of shocked, myself, that I could write an Ayanami POV, we're complete opposites. XD Well Asuka's for a fact an open book in the Anime and the manga [with her past and all] but Ayanami... for me was an enigma all throughout. She being a clone is a factor but what would she be if she wasn't, that's what I was thinking. I'm trying my best to keep them in character as much as possible, I sure do hope I am. But, I wanted to give them a touch of my own, something to spice things up. My Rei was... madly inlove. Lol. Transparently. But she's still in a way reserved and more straightforward. My Asuka wasn't a complete bitch but still outspoken. And, Shinji... he's Shinji and emotionally unstable and... I'm still thinking what I should do with him. :P  
作者的话：首先感谢评论者和读者们。没错，chapter两篇，我其实很享受写这篇。哈哈。[虽然不如写 SxA 文那么带劲，但谁能想到呢。]我自己也挺惊讶的，居然能写绫波的视角，我们完全相反嘛。XD 嘛，动漫和漫画里的明日香确实是个透明人[关于她的过去等等]，但绫波...对我来说一直是个谜。她是克隆人这一点有影响，但我在想，如果她不是克隆人，她会是什么样呢？我尽力让她们保持角色本色，希望我做到了。不过，我也想给她们加点自己的特色，让故事更有趣。我的丽...疯狂地爱着。哈哈。透明地。但她还是有点保留，更直接。我的明日香不是完全的泼妇，但依然直言不讳。至于真嗣...他就是真嗣，情绪不稳定，而我还在想该怎么处理他。:P

**qwertyui:** I love weird, creepy, eccentric. And good to know incest isn't a bother to you at all. Yes, i'll definitely continue and sorry if it might take some time for updates. And right now, I have three fan fictions in progress.  
qwertyui: 我热爱那些古怪、诡异、特立独行的元素。很高兴得知乱伦题材对你毫无困扰。是的，我肯定会继续更新，但若更新稍有延迟，还请见谅。目前，我有三篇同人小说正在创作中。

**Gob Hobblin:** I, honestly, am not good with descriptive writing. I'm still working on it but I must say that this style suits me better. And yes, this universe that I created is without a doubt messed up. The more damage I make the better. And actually, I haven't even read a Shinji x Rei fan fiction, ever. O.o Hehe.  
戈布·霍布林：老实说，我不擅长描写性写作。我还在努力提升，但必须承认这种风格更适合我。没错，我创造的这个宇宙无疑是一团糟。我造成的破坏越多越好。实际上，我甚至从未读过任何碇真嗣 x 绫波零的同人文。O.o 呵呵。

**KendrixTermina:** Yeah, I was a bit hesitant if I would continue with this incest thingy but well I did and I don't have any regrets at all. I'm striving for a unique Shinji x Rei tale in spite of the short chapter lengths. I still hope I could properly convey what the characters are going through, specially Rei.  
KendrixTermina：是的，我曾有些犹豫是否要继续这个乱伦题材，但最终我还是做了，并且毫不后悔。我努力在有限的chapter篇幅内，打造一个独特的真嗣与丽的故事。我依然希望能恰当地表达角色们的内心世界，尤其是丽。

Man, I was overly touched with these people. Really, thank you so much. I never thought it would caught anyone's interest. It was a great Christmas gift. hahaha. I know I have a lot to learn and your words make me want to push forward. Thanks again guys! [And sorry for all grammar mistakes, English is not my main language.] Happy Holidays everyone. ^_^  
伙计，我被这些人深深打动了。真的，非常感谢你们。我从没想过会有人对它感兴趣。这真是个美妙的圣诞礼物，哈哈哈。我知道我还有很多要学习的地方，你们的鼓励让我更想向前迈进。再次感谢大家！[还有，抱歉我的语法错误，英语不是我的母语。]祝大家节日快乐。^_^

### Chapter 3

"You shouldn't have left the house if you aren't feeling well."  
"如果你感觉不舒服，就不该出门的。"

"Uhm.." "呃..."

"No arguments ojou-sama. Rest well while I visit the other hard-headed hime-sama. Hahaha. But, thank you for taking the time to visit Asuka."  
"别争了，大小姐。你好好休息，我去看看那位顽固的公主大人。哈哈哈。不过，谢谢你抽空来看望明日香。"

And I thought I could stay with you all night.  
我还以为我能整晚陪着你。

Together at this special day.  
在这特别的日子里，我们在一起。

"Shin... Can't you stay?"  
“真……你不能留下来吗？”

I probabyly know what you're about to say... yet I keep my hopes up.  
我大概知道你接下来要说什么...但我仍抱有希望。

"Hmm.. I would love to. But.. I already promised i'll spend the night with her. And!  
嗯...我很愿意。但是...我已经答应和她共度今晚了。而且！

She's going to be discharged tomorrow. Hehe."  
她明天就要出院了。呵呵。

You look genuinely happy.  
你看起来真的很开心。

Very contradicting from what I saw not too long ago.  
这与不久前我所见到的截然相反。

"Is that so. Good for her."  
“是吗。那她真幸运。”

Good for her. 她做得好。

You never neglected me before, but lately.. I just became the other option.. the less priority..  
你以前从未忽视过我，但最近……我只是成了次要选择……优先级更低了……

Or maybe you're just running away because of what i've said.  
或者也许你只是因为我说的话而逃避。

"I'm really sorry I won't be able to look after you. I'll call once I get there, alright?  
"我真的非常抱歉不能照顾你了。我一到那儿就给你打电话，好吗？

My Rei's a big girl now."  
我的丽现在是个大姑娘了。

You softly ruffled my hair.  
你轻轻地揉乱了我的头发。

Once again, i'm lost, deep within your unknown gaze.  
又一次，我迷失在你深邃未知的目光中。

We left the living room.  
我们离开了客厅。

The walk through the hallway, I wonder if I can make it a little further.  
穿过走廊的每一步，我在想是否能再走远一点。

Should I cast a spell on my room to make it disappear?  
我应该对我的房间施个咒让它消失吗？

We both stopped right outside my room.  
我们俩就停在我的房间外。

You held you right hand up and lay it on my left cheek.  
你举起右手，轻轻放在我的左脸颊上。

You swiftly ran your thumb across my lower lip and walked away.  
你迅速地用拇指划过我的下唇，然后转身离开。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

What was that. 那是什么意思？

I was seeking for an answer.  
我在寻找一个答案。

None, I couldn't read you at all.  
没有，我完全读不懂你。

I can't grasp the meaning of your actions.  
我无法理解你的行为意图。

"Mm-mm. See you. Take care."  
“嗯嗯。再见。保重。”

"Yes, ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

You smiled, like nothing happened.  
你微笑着，仿佛什么都没发生。

I gasped, a lot has happened.  
我倒吸一口凉气，发生了很多事。

The previous events, due to my fever, were nothing but misconceptions, yet again.  
由于发烧，之前的事件不过又是一连串的误解。

A never-ending cycle. 一个永无止境的循环。

You would always choose her.  
你总是会选择她。

I'd let you, knowing you'll always come back.  
我会让你走，因为我知道你总会回来。

Right? 对吧？

You'll always come back to me, right?  
你总会回到我身边，对吧？

No matter what happens, at the end, yo'll end up needing me most.  
无论发生什么，到最后，你最需要的人还是我。

I know it, no, i'm certain of it.  
我知道这一点，不，我确信无疑。

The thought brought a small smile to my lips.  
这个念头让我的嘴角泛起一丝微笑。

I entered my room and sat on my bed.  
我走进房间，坐在床上。

I saw it.. my own expression at the mirror.  
我看到了...镜中自己的表情。

and honestly it creeped me out... just a little.  
老实说，这让我有点毛骨悚然...只是稍微。

xoxo 亲亲抱抱

---

I was sheated in a calm and warm feeling of his embrace when I opened my eyes the following day.  
次日睁眼时，我沉浸在他拥抱的宁静与温暖之中。

He was in deep forty winks I didn't dare mess it up.  
他正酣睡，我不敢打扰。

Dozing my mind off from life's actuality through studying his unconscious form is like listening to an unfamiliar song with a pleasing melody.  
通过凝视他无意识的样子来逃避生活的现实，就像聆听一首旋律悦耳的陌生歌曲。

I can't fathom a distinct word but the harmony alone makes me want to continually listen to it as I fall in abysmal serenity.  
我无法用一个确切的词来形容，但仅是那和谐之音就让我渴望不断聆听，沉醉于深邃的宁静之中。

"Rei... You... You're sleeping in my room again."  
丽...你...你又在我的房间里睡觉了。

He 他

I engulfed my face on the crook of his neck.  
我将脸埋在他颈窝处。

Lost in his scent mixed with hers.  
迷失在他与她的混合香气中。

Its too bittersweet but nothing I couldn't handle.  
这太过苦涩，但并非我无法承受。

After all i'm sure she felt stingy when she caught mine last night.  
毕竟，我确信她昨晚发现我的秘密时感到有些小气。

"Good. Your fever's gone."  
“好。你的烧退了。”

It started when we were young, probably 7 years old.  
这一切始于我们年幼时，大概七岁那年。

That's when I started having strange dreams.  
就在那时，我开始做起了奇怪的梦。

A time when kids would normally run to their parents room to seek comfort, I don't.  
通常孩子们会跑向父母的房间寻求安慰，而我不会。

I always found my way inside my brother's arms.  
我总是能找到进入哥哥怀抱的路。

"You're here, what about her."  
“你在这里，那她呢？”

He let out a deep breath.  
他深深地呼出一口气。

Silence means they fought, yet again.  
沉默意味着他们又吵架了。

"She's so stubborn. I told her you're sick and you didn't respond to my messages and calls so I was worried I want to go home right after I bring her home. She wouldn't let me."  
“她太固执了。我告诉她你病了，没回我消息和电话，我很担心，想送她回家后就立刻回去。她就是不让。”

So this time I was the cause of her tantrums.  
所以这次是我引发了她的脾气。

Its a first, might've been because of that.  
这是第一次，可能就是因为这个。

Well, its partly my fault for leaving my phone inside my room.  
嗯，部分是我的错，我把手机留在房间里了。

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"Shhh. You're not at fault."  
"嘘。这不是你的错。"

He arose from the bed as my head fell hitting his pillow.  
他从床上起身，我的头垂下，撞上了他的枕头。

He never, even once blamed me, even if its entirely my wrong doing.  
他从未，哪怕一次，责怪过我，即便全然是我的过失。

"You should stop going to my room, Rei."  
"你应该停止去我的房间，丽。"

But most of the time, he does things that make me bitter.  
但大多数时候，他做的事情让我感到苦涩。

"Why." "为什么。"

Its as if he wanted to shut down the place where I freely roam my thoughts somewhere else so that I can mindlessly lock myself inside the tranquility I could only seek when we're together, alone.  
仿佛他想关闭我自由游走思绪的地方，让我能在别处无意识地将自己锁进只有在两人独处时才能寻得的宁静。

"We're adults. Siblings don't normally sleep together at this stage."  
"我们都成年了。这个年纪，兄妹通常不会一起睡。"

His back was facing me so I didn't know how he looked like.  
他的背对着我，所以我不知道他长什么样。

"Who says so." "谁说的。"

I sat up, sheets falling flat on the ground exposing my skin to the cold.  
我坐起身，床单平铺在地上，让我的皮肤暴露在寒冷中。

"When you find yourself a guy, you'll know what i'm talking about."  
"等你找到心仪的人，就会明白我在说什么了。"

"You know who I really-"  
"你知道我真正指的是谁——"

"Stop it, please." "请别说了。"

*Ding Dong* *叮咚*

He got a hold of the fallen sheet.  
他捡起了掉落的床单。

*Ding Dong Ding Dong* *叮咚叮咚*

We fixed our eyes against each other, his' practically wandered on my exposed skin but then he darted his eyes away.  
我们彼此凝视着对方，他的目光几乎在我裸露的肌肤上游移，但随即又迅速移开了视线。

He wrapped the blanket on me and before I could mouth a word, he's out of my sight.  
他将毯子裹在我身上，我还没来得及吐出一个字，他就已经消失在我的视线之外。

I lunged backward, crumbling rocklike in the mattress, bringing my left hand up to my face making sure I put enough pressure in my eyes to prevent something.  
我猛地向后一缩，像岩石般瘫倒在床垫上，抬起左手捂住脸，确保用力压住眼睛，以防万一。

To cease a release. 停止发布。

While at it, I felt something hard against my face and a little added weight on my wrist.  
就在这时，我感觉有什么硬物抵在脸上，手腕上也多了些许重量。

I held it up, my eyes appraising the simple chains entwined together, encircling my wrist.  
我举起它，目光审视着那简单交织在一起的链条，环绕在我的手腕上。

"Insensitive bastard.." “没心没肺的混蛋……”

_So this is what taking you so long.  
原来这就是你花了这么长时间的原因。_

I searched for him throught the whole house only to find him in the entrance hallway, liplocking her.  
我在整个房子里找他，结果发现他在门厅入口处和她热吻。

They've been doing this scheme for so long, don't know why it never gets old.  
他们这套把戏玩了这么久，不知道为什么从来不会过时。

She'd start an argument, most of the time childish nonsense ones but will eventually approach him first.  
她会挑起争端，大多时候是些幼稚无理的争吵，但最终总是她先去找他。

Not to apologize, he'll do all the talking, owning the blame.  
并非为了道歉，他会承担所有对话，揽下所有过错。

She gets mad like nothing but cools off her head in a haste.  
她会气得不行，却又急匆匆地平息怒火。

Shinji gets annoyed at her too but when he sees her, he'd yet again fall in her bewitchery in the course of time.  
真嗣对她也感到恼火，但当他看到她时，随着时间的推移，他再次陷入了她的魅力之中。

Asuka opened her eyes and immediately caught mine, concluding the kiss they shared.  
明日香睁开眼睛，立刻捕捉到了我的目光，结束了他们之间的吻。

She then caught him in her arms, still sharply gazing at me.  
她随即拥他入怀，依旧锐利地凝视着我。

"How's Rei doing?" "丽怎么样了？"

"Her fever's gone. She's a lot better."  
“她的烧退了。她好多了。”

"That's great." “那太好了。”

She pushed her mouth in a sardonic smile.  
她嘴角勾起一抹嘲讽的微笑。

She's transparently doing this on purpose.  
她明显是故意这么做的。

She nibbled his ear. 她轻咬了一下他的耳朵。

Really intentionally. 真的，故意的。

My eyes are glued, I couldn't drift them away.  
我的目光被牢牢吸引，无法移开。

No. 不。

I don't want to take my eyes off them.  
我不想将视线从他们身上移开。

Still.. it pricks like hell.  
还是...疼得要命。

Shinji tightened his grip on her waist.  
真嗣紧紧搂住了她的腰。

She whispered at him. 她对他低语。

He turned his head. 他转过头来。

"Rei? What..." “丽？什么……”

She.. This woman. 她...这个女人。

Her quirky behavior is really something.  
她那古怪的行为真是与众不同。

"I'm going out." “我要出门了。”

I softly said. 我轻声说道。

Just enough for them to hear.  
刚好让他们听见。

My voice might've cracked a bit.  
我的声音可能有点儿颤抖。

I don't think they took notice.  
我想他们没注意到。

I walked past them. 我走过他们身边。

"Rei! I'll come with you."  
"丽！我跟你一起去。"

You shouldn't say that when she's around.  
她在这儿的时候，你不该这么说。

"Let me just get the umbrella."  
"让我来拿伞。"

"Wait Shin-" "等等，真-"

Shinji dashed to get the umbrella, inbetween Asuka's attempt to stop him.  
真嗣冲过去拿伞，而明日香试图阻止他。

"Tell him I went ahead."  
"告诉他我先走了。"

I ordered, my back facing her.  
我命令道，背对着她。

"Stop. What do you think you're doing?"  
"停下。你以为你在做什么？"

She asked coldly. 她冷冷地问道。

"And I don't accept questions as a feedback."  
“而我也不接受提问作为反馈。”

She added, as if she already knew I didn't intend to counterclaim directly.  
她补充道，仿佛早已知道我不打算直接反驳。

"I don't want to see you together."  
"我不想看到你们在一起。"

You want honest, i'll give you honest.  
你想要实话，我就给你实话。

"Hah! Are you making me laugh? You didn't take your eyes off the whole time. If I didn't tell him, you might've seen something you wouldn't want to witness at all. You're pretty brave.. but crazy."  
"哈哈！你在逗我笑吗？你全程眼睛都没离开过。要不是我告诉他，你可能已经看到了一些你根本不想看到的东西。你挺勇敢的……但也很疯狂。"

You just don't get it do you, Soryu.  
你就是不明白，对吧，Soryu。

You'll never know how it feels to have something that is within your reach yet still you couldn't get a hold of it.  
你永远不会知道那种感觉，明明近在咫尺，却始终无法抓住。

Running away is not my thing.  
逃跑可不是我的风格。

Right now, all I want is to cool my head off.  
眼下，我只希望能冷静一下头脑。

As long as I know i'm capable of enduring, I will.  
只要我知道自己能坚持下去，我就会坚持。

As long as he is existing, so do I.. and so are these feelings.  
只要他存在，我便存在.. 这些情感亦然。

"I'm going." “我要走了。”

But with your existence invading, there's nothing more I could do.  
但你的存在侵入，我已无计可施。

Just holding onto this little hope.  
只是紧紧抓住这微小的希望。

I recalled, I said I don't hate this woman.  
我记得，我说过我不讨厌这个女人。

I lied. 我撒谎了。

"I'll go with you, I have an umbrella."  
“我跟你一起去，我有伞。”

"You don't have to." "你不必这么做。"

I might do things offhandedly.  
我可能会随意行事。

"I insist! Let's go."  
“我坚持！我们走吧。”

Her way of thinking, so impervious.  
她的思维方式，如此固执己见。

I took off while she's busy with her umbrella.  
趁她忙于摆弄伞时，我溜之大吉。

"HEY! I said! What! Argh. REI!"  
“嘿！我说了！什么！啊。丽！”

I don't know why she wanted to come, she doesn't give a damn.  
我不知道她为什么想来，她根本不在乎。

I walked fast. 我快步走。

She won't be able to catch up, she's got a sprained ankle after all.  
她追不上了，毕竟脚踝扭伤了。

I needed to go as far as I could before he comes.  
我得尽可能地走远，在他回来之前。

I don't want to see it.  
我不想看到那一幕。

Him taking her side. 他站在她那边。

Of course I want him to choose me.  
当然，我希望他选择我。

But he doesn't have to, because he knows, we both know.. he already got me.  
但他不必这么做，因为他知道，我们都知道……他已经得到了我。

Just not in the way I want it to be.  
只是并非以我期望的方式。

Because i'm greedy.. 因为我太贪心了……

..and I think so is he.  
……我想他也是。

**t.b.c. 待续。**

**A/N:** I read a disturbing manga last night. Argh. It was soo dark and its yaoi. And, its still ongoing which is torture. Reading manga such as that was a punch in the face. But it might also get me in the mood. Kekeke.  
作者笔记：昨晚看了一部令人不安的漫画。啊。太黑暗了，还是耽美题材。而且，它还在连载中，简直是折磨。看这种漫画就像被打了一拳。但也许它能让我进入状态。呵呵呵。

If you guys wanted to read something for fun after reading my gloomy story, read this webtoon entitled **My Heart is Beating**. Interesting fun.  
如果你们在我这阴郁的故事后想找点乐子读读，不妨看看这部名为《我的心在跳动》的网络漫画。有趣又好玩。

NapalmInTheRain: 嗯嗯。很快就会了。^_^ 谢谢。

**KendrixTermina**: Thanks for reviewing and nope, i'm not going to create a yandere Rei. haha. Definitely, not heading that way. There are instances that we do things impulsively, and we don't even know we're capable of such actions.  
KendrixTermina：感谢你的评论，不，我不会创造一个病娇丽。哈哈。绝对不会朝那个方向发展。有时候我们会冲动行事，甚至不知道自己能做出这样的举动。

邪恶黑暗映像：我的故事也爱你……呵呵。丽只是……恋爱了。爱上了一个她不该有那种感觉的人。感谢你的评论。

Been dealing with personal matters of my own. Actually, these fics.. some of it are of my own experience then i'll just add some twist and turns. And as always, I really appreciate my readers and reviewers. Its awesome to know somebody appreciates...  
一直在处理自己的私事。实际上，这些同人文...其中一部分源自我的亲身经历，然后我会加入一些曲折和转折。一如既往，我非常感激我的读者和评论者。知道有人欣赏...真是太棒了。

Thanks once again, lets all have an epic day(s), laters.  
再次感谢，让我们都拥有一个精彩的日子（们），再见。

### Chapter 4

I love her. 我爱她。

I know and believe that I truly do.  
我深知并坚信这一点。

But I was caught up between the idea of being her brother or, a man who sees her as a woman.  
但我陷入了两难：是作为她的兄长，还是作为一个将她视为女人的男人。

I think this is entirely my fault.  
我觉得这完全是我自己的错。

Lately, my sister's been acting strange. I showed her something I shouldn't have. I wanted to stop her. I think its too late for that.  
最近，我妹妹的行为变得很奇怪。我给她看了不该看的东西。我想阻止她。但我觉得现在可能已经太晚了。

I can't entriely put all the blame on her, because I can't even control my own emotion.  
我不能完全把责任都推给她，因为我甚至无法控制自己的情绪。

Often times, its just too overwhelming that I really have to repeatedly curse at myself to cease it.  
很多时候，这种感觉太过强烈，我不得不反复咒骂自己来停止它。

The last thing I would want to do is to see her hurt. Knowing that i'm capable of hurting her kills me.  
我最不想看到的就是她受伤。知道我有能力伤害她，这让我心如刀割。

We're the same but we're also different.  
我们相似，但也不同。

We get along pretty well unlike any other siblings.  
我们相处得非常好，不像其他兄弟姐妹那样。

We share a lot of common things, from food to movies.  
我们有很多共同点，从食物到电影。

But we most likely don't look alike.  
但我们很可能长得不像。

Yeah, we're not twins so that kind of explains it but, there really is a huge difference in our appearance that people have mistaken us as an item when we're together.  
是啊，我们不是双胞胎，所以这解释了为什么，但我们的外表确实有很大差异，以至于人们误以为我们是一对，当我们在一起时。

I look normal. 我看起来很正常。

Not that my sister looks abnormal, she is beautiful.  
并不是说我妹妹看起来不正常，她很漂亮。

She stands out in a crowd.  
她在人群中格外显眼。

She gives off this mysterious aura, you would want to know her more.

I'm most definitely not a ladies' man.  
我绝对不是什么情场高手。

I can't hold a proper conversation with strangers.  
我无法与陌生人进行正常的对话。

I'm utterly surprised that Asuka is my girlfriend, she's my complete opposite.  
我完全没想到明日香会成为我的女朋友，她和我简直是天壤之别。

I give off this I don't really care vibe. Asuka is probably just one nosy girl to begin with.  
我给人的感觉就是不太在乎。明日香可能一开始就是个爱管闲事的女孩。

Our parents work in different countries.  
我们的父母在不同的国家工作。

They don't spend most of their time with us.

They clearly set their priorities, and obviously its not us.

During those times we welcome them with fake smiles painted on our faces.

Of course they would always believe us.

They're pretty proud of themselves that even though they're not around, we grew up excelling in our studies.  
他们颇为自豪，即便不在身边，我们依然在学业上出类拔萃。

Never did they hear a single complain from any of us.  
我们从没有人发出过一句怨言。

We lived the life they wanted us to have.  
我们过着他们希望我们拥有的生活。

We've relied on each other all our lives, we've got no one else to lean on.

Our parents don't have a clue to any of the shits we're facing in school.

We've never opened our hearts to others.  
我们从未向他人敞开心扉。

We only have each other, and to us that was enough.  
我们只有彼此，对我们来说，这就足够了。

That was what I thought.  
我原本就是这么想的。

Not until I have crossed that borderline.  
直到我跨越那条界限之前。

Not until she have accepted me beyond that borderline.  
直到她接受我超越那条界限之前。

To her, this is unfair. She is so naive. She is one of the most gentle persons that I have known, not that I know too many.  
对她来说，这太不公平了。她如此天真。她是我所认识的最温柔的人之一，虽然我认识的人也不算太多。

I want her untainted, she is special.  
我希望她保持纯净，她是特别的。

After some time, after certain events took place, slowly, I distanced myself from Rei.  
一段时间后，某些事件发生后，我慢慢地疏远了丽。

I spend more time with Asuka which makes her totally happy, but I make sure that I still do my responsibilities as her brother.

It just came out of the blue.  
这突如其来，毫无预兆。

Its as if the pain I was forcing on her wasn't enough.  
仿佛我强加给她的痛苦还不够多。

I couldn't be any less sensitive about her feelings.  
我对她的感受毫不敏感。

What reaction should I expect from the girl across me.  
对面女孩会有什么反应呢？

What is it that I want to get from starting this conversation.  
我想通过这场对话得到什么呢？

She isn't moving. 她一动不动。

She didn't even flinch. 她甚至没有退缩。

In a brief moment, our whole world stopped.  
在那一瞬间，我们的整个世界都静止了。

I'm just intently studying her, still waiting for whatever that is bound to happen.  
我只是专注地观察着她，依旧等待着那注定会发生的事情。

After what seemed like an eternity, she stands up.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，她站了起来。

I remain sitted, still waiting.  
我依旧坐着，仍在等待。

She is clearly avoiding any eye contact, keeping her eyes locked on the ground.  
她明显在避免任何眼神接触，双眼紧盯着地面。

Finally, words she carefully chose to spit out come out of her mouth.  
终于，她精心挑选的言辞从口中吐露出来。

"How do you want me to respond to that?"  
“你希望我如何回应呢？”

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Well, _brother_, I really don't know what to say."  
“唉，兄弟，我真不知道该说什么了。”

The emphasis in the word brother shows that she is on the verge of emotional breakdown.  
"brother"一词中的强调表明她正处于情绪崩溃的边缘。

Without looking up, Rei wa about to leave the dining area before I got a hold of her arm.  
没有抬头，丽正要离开餐厅，我及时抓住了她的手臂。

"What do you really want me to do?"  
“你到底想让我做什么？”

She said in a shaky voice.  
她用颤抖的声音说道。

I wanted to hug her.  
我想拥抱她。

I wanted to apologize.  
我想道歉。

If I could change how things are, I would've done that ages ago.  
如果我能改变现状，早就那么做了。

But what am I doing?  
但我到底在做什么呢？

I tightly chained my hand in her arm.  
我紧紧地将手扣在她的臂弯里。

What do I really want from her?  
我究竟想从她那里得到什么？

"You're a coward." "你是个懦夫。"

This is surprising to me.  
这让我感到意外。

She is doing all the talking.  
她一直在滔滔不绝地说。

I could feel the weight of her heavy breathing and how she is managing to hold back the tears so badly.  
我能感受到她沉重的呼吸，以及她多么艰难地忍住泪水。

The grip of my hand in her arm just tightens even more as the atmosphere around us continues to darken.  
我握住她手臂的手愈发收紧，随着我们周围的氛围愈发阴沉。

"How about me? How about Asuka? You're only thinking of yourself."  
“那我呢？明日香呢？你只考虑你自己。”

I always thought I was doing things for Rei's sake.  
我一直以为我所做的一切都是为了丽。

Growing up together and playing the good ol role of being the great big brother.  
一起长大，扮演着那个伟大兄长的角色。

I thought that I was doing a great job, tending to her needs as she blooms into a fine young lady that I would be proud of.  
我原以为自己做得很好，在她成长为一位令我骄傲的优秀少女的过程中，尽心照顾她的需求。

I think I overdid it.  
我觉得我做得有点过头了。

"If you're going to abandon me, just do so. Why do you have to use her to hurt me!"  
“如果你打算抛弃我，那就直接做吧。为什么要利用她来伤害我！”

Rei falls down to her knees as she brings her free hand to cover her face.  
丽跪倒在地，用空着的手捂住脸。

I stand up and kneel beside her, not letting go of her arm.  
我站起身，跪在她身边，没有放开她的手臂。

I don't want for any of these to happen.  
我不希望这些事情中的任何一件发生。

It pains me most to see her like this.  
看到她这样，最让我心痛。

She is right, i'm nothing but a coward.  
她说的没错，我不过是个懦夫。

A selfish coward who thinks nothing but his own happiness.  
一个自私的懦夫，只想着自己的幸福。

I've been blinded by the beauty of love I was receiving from my sister.  
我被从妹妹那里得到的爱之美所蒙蔽。

Mindlessly doing things that I thought would benefit her in the uttermost, the truth is i'm doing it because it makes me satisfied.  
无意识地做着那些我以为对她最有益的事，实则我这么做只是因为它让我感到满足。

I needed her to need me.  
我需要她需要我。

Fascinated to the thought that she would always lean on me, I shut her in a world I created.  
对她会永远依赖我的想法着迷，我将她封闭在我创造的世界里。

I made her unable to trust no one but me.  
我让她无法信任除我之外的任何人。

I am the sole root of her destruction.  
我是她毁灭的唯一根源。

I wanted her all for myself. I craved beyond what she was supposed to give, but the idea of an outlawed affair scares me.  
我想要她完全属于我。我渴望超越她应给予的，但非法恋情这个念头让我害怕。

"I feel sorry for myself. That no matter what you do to me, no matter how harsh this reality you are pushing on me, I will always choose you. After endless rejections. It will always be you Shinji. Over and over."  
"我为自己感到难过。无论你对我做什么，无论你强加给我的现实有多么残酷，我总会选择你。在无数次的拒绝之后。永远都是你，真嗣。一遍又一遍。"

There's a silent pause before she continues.  
她继续之前，有一阵沉默。

"But don't you think this is too much?"  
"但你不觉得这太过分了吗？"

After that, everything was a blur. Next thing I know, Asuka is the one sitting beside me.  
在那之后，一切都变得模糊不清。当我回过神来时，坐在我身边的是明日香。

"What did you do this time?"  
“这次你又做了什么？”  
We are at my room. I can't clearly remember when and how.  
我们在我的房间里。我不太记得具体的时间和方式了。

We are both sitting on the bed, lights are off.  
我们俩都坐在床上，灯已经关了。

"Where is Rei?" “丽在哪里？”

I mumbled. 我咕哝道。

I can't remember anything. I think I blacked out. So ironic I was the one who blacked out. Such a sorry ass.  
我什么也记不起来。我想我是昏过去了。真是讽刺，居然是我昏倒了。真是个可怜虫。

"I checked on her just a while ago. She is resting. Took me forever to drag her inside her room. Your sister was a mess when I came. You were lying flat on the ground while she was sobbing uncontrollably. She wouldn't even tell me what happened. Damn, I thought you're hurt or something. Looking at you right now, you seem okay. I mean, physically you're good. Mentally, not so sure. Did you two fight?"  
我刚刚去看了她，她在休息。费了好大劲才把她拖进房间。我来的时候你妹妹一团糟，你躺在地上，她哭得不能自已。她连发生了什么都说不出来。该死，我还以为你受伤了什么的。现在看着你，似乎还好。我是说，身体上没问题。心理上，就不太确定了。你们俩吵架了吗？

I wasn't really listening to her.  
我其实没怎么听她说话。

My mind is filled with countless things, its really hard to focus.  
我脑子里装满了无数的事情，真的很难集中注意力。

"Hey. Are you even with me right now? What the heck is happening? This is bugging me out."  
“嘿。你到底有没有在听我说话？这到底是怎么回事？我快被烦死了。”

She pushes me, my back crashing softly on the supposed to be warm thick sheet of the bed, but I feel cold, I didn't even notice Asuka lying on top of me.  
她推了我一把，我的背轻轻地撞上了本应温暖厚实的床单，但我感到寒冷，我甚至没注意到明日香正躺在我身上。

"You've been so out of it lately. Tell me about it."  
“你最近总是心不在焉。告诉我怎么了。”

She whispers ever so softly on my ear as I slowly come back to my senses then she begins to play with my hair. Gently swirling the locks in her fingers.  
她在我耳边轻声细语，我慢慢回过神来，她开始玩弄我的头发，温柔地用手指卷起一缕缕发丝。

I close my eyes as I start to relax against her warmth and once again get lost in my train of thought.  
我闭上眼睛，开始在她温暖的怀抱中放松，思绪再次飘远。

I love her. 我爱她。

But its half-baked. 但它是半成品。

Reality is I, desperately, try so hard to love her.  
现实是，我拼命地、努力地去爱她。

But Asuka is controlling and meddlesome.  
但明日香控制欲强又爱管闲事。

That's when I hold back, can't help it, I hate that part of her.  
就在那时我忍住了，控制不住，我讨厌她那一部分。

We never run out of stories to tell, words to say, actions to do.  
我们总有说不完的故事，道不尽的话语，做不完的行动。

Still, you know that feeling when someone struggles real hard to strike a conversation because, well, that someone just hungers for attention.  
不过，你知道那种感觉吗？当某人费尽心思想要开启对话，因为，嗯，那个人就是渴望关注。

I always feel it when i'm with her, its so unnatural that it could get really tiring.  
每当我与她在一起时，我总能感受到那种不自然，它如此强烈，以至于真的会让人感到疲惫。

Why do I stay, tolerating this facade.  
我为何还要留下，忍受这层伪装。

'Cause I know she wants me to.  
因为我知道她希望我这么做。

That's what I really needed. It could be anybody, it just happened to be her.  
那正是我真正需要的。可以是任何人，只不过碰巧是她。

To put it simple, I'm just an attention freak, its the only possible explanation.  
简而言之，我只是个渴望关注的人，这是唯一合理的解释。

At least when i'm with her, I don't feel any guilt.  
至少和她在一起时，我没有任何愧疚感。

I feel like i'm just a normal man in love with another woman.  
我感觉自己就像一个普通的男人，爱上了另一个女人。

We would walk in the streets, hand in hand, without caring what others are thinking.  
我们会手牵手走在街上，不在乎别人怎么想。

_Aren't the two of them siblings? Don't you think they're way too close. They stick together all the time.  
他们俩不是兄妹吗？你不觉得他们过于亲密了吗？总是形影不离的。_

We won't have to put up with dirty stares and whispering.  
我们不必再忍受那些厌恶的目光和窃窃私语了。

_She is old enough to take care of herself, I think he is being overprotective of her sister, he couldn't keep his sight off her for a second.  
她已经足够成熟，能够照顾自己了，我觉得他对妹妹的保护过度了，他一刻也不肯将视线从她身上移开。_

Other people won't be able to hurt us because in their eyes, we are doing something indecent and unacceptable.  
在别人眼里，我们所做之事不雅且不可接受，因此他们无法伤害我们。

_You know you're being a bit of a spoiled brat for always clinging on your brother right? Are you in love with him? Ew! You can't do that! You guys make us sick!  
你知道你总是黏着你哥有点像被宠坏的小孩吗？你爱上他了吗？咦！那可不行！你们这样让我们恶心！_

We would end the day with smiles plastered on our lips, engulfed in the swarm of happiness.  
我们会在笑容满面中结束这一天，沉浸在幸福的包围中。

_I think they're together.  
我想他们在一起了。_

_Really? Yuck. That's the grossest thing ever. Haha!  
真的吗？好恶心。这是最糟糕的事情了。哈哈！_

_Look at how close they are. I'm not like that when i'm with my siblings.  
看他们多亲密。我和兄弟姐妹在一起时可没这样。_

_Yeah, you're right. They're probably doing things that lovers do. Hahahahaha!  
是啊，你说得对。他们可能在干情侣之间的事。哈哈哈哈哈！_

_Oh my gosh! You did not!  
哦天哪！你没开玩笑吧！_

_Hahahahahahaha. 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。_

_Whoa. Stop it, I think they can hear us.  
哇哦。停下，我觉得他们能听见我们。_

_Who cares, they're weirdos.  
谁在乎呢，他们都是怪人。_

Because some people don't understand what we've been through.  
因为有些人不明白我们经历了什么。

That life is not always rainbows and sunshines.  
生活并不总是彩虹和阳光。

That some people like us are having a hard time sucking that fact up.  
有些人就是难以接受这个事实，我们也不例外。

_My, look at her. She is such a slut. Smiling like that while flirting with her brother.  
天哪，看她那样。真是个荡妇，一边对她哥哥卖弄风情一边笑得那么灿烂。_

_I know right! 就是啊！_

_Such a shame, she is so pretty.  
真是可惜，她那么漂亮。_

_Nah, she is a big flirt. I hate her.  
算了吧，她是个大花痴。我讨厌她。_

_You're just jealous. Haha!  
你就是嫉妒。哈哈！_

_Shut up! 闭嘴！_

Don't listen to them Rei, you're not any of what they are saying.  
别听他们的，丽，你绝不是他们说的那样。

It is normal to take care of each other, we have no one else.  
互相照顾是常事，我们别无他人。

I won't let them hurt you so just stay close to me.  
我不会让他们伤害你，所以请紧跟着我。

You don't need them, they're not friends.  
你不需要他们，他们不是朋友。

You have me, don't let their words bother you.  
你有我，别让他们的言语困扰你。

They're just going to use you, they can't do that.  
他们只是想利用你，这可不行。

Not when I'm here protecting you.  
不是有我在这儿保护你吗。

"Who is using who? Will you always protect me?"  
"谁在利用谁？你会一直保护我吗？"

"Rei?" "丽？"

I thought I heard her voice.  
我以为我听到了她的声音。

I thought she's the one lying with me.  
我以为她就是和我躺在一起的那个人。

I fell asleep unknowingly.  
我不知不觉地睡着了。

The weight against me moves.  
压在我身上的重量动了动。

"Go check on her." “去看看她。”

Asuka stands up and fixes her clothes.  
明日香站起身，整理了一下衣服。

I sit up, encircle my arms around her waist and rest my head against her stomach.  
我坐起身，双臂环绕在她的腰间，将头靠在她的腹部。

"Did you tell her?" “你告诉她了吗？”

I nodded. 我点点头。

She sighs. 她叹了口气。

"That explains why. I need to go. Check up early in the morning"  
"原来如此。我得走了。明早早点检查"

She removes my arms, pecks me on the lips and grabs her bag.  
她移开我的手臂，轻吻我的唇，然后抓起她的包。

"I'll see you out." "我送你出去。"

We walked out of my room, descending in the hallow darkness of the hallways.  
我们走出我的房间，在空荡荡的走廊的黑暗中缓缓下行。

I'm absent-mindedly taking my time to drag my feet on the floor, slowly, each step getting heavy as we near the front door.  
我心不在焉地拖着脚步，慢慢地，每走一步都显得越来越沉重，当我们接近前门时。

The wide-opened front door.  
那扇敞开的大门。

It didn't take me another second before I hurriedly fly my way to her room.  
我几乎没再耽搁一秒，便急忙飞奔向她的房间。

My whole body shaking and feet a lot heavier than before.  
我全身颤抖，双脚比以往任何时候都要沉重。

The journey from the front door to her room was the longest i've had in my entirely life.  
从大门到她房间的这段路，是我一生中走过最漫长的。

The loud thumping of my heart that wanted to explode any minute from now.  
心脏剧烈跳动，仿佛随时都会爆炸。

Her door is open.  
她的门敞开着。

Her wardrobe is open.  
她的衣柜敞开着。

Some clothes are gone. 有些衣服不见了。

Her bag is gone.  
她的包不见了。

Phone is gone. 手机不见了。

I fall to my knees, wishing I could sink further.  
我跪倒在地，真希望自己能陷得更深些。

She is gone. 她已离去。

I love her. 我爱她。

**A/N:** I knoooow. This took me forever. Hahaha. My deepest apologies guys. It is hard to write a first person POV but I really wanted to properly show certain scenarios that only one's personal experience is able to properly convey. I did try my best to stay true to the character's own personalities but I wanna give it a touch of my own. I've always wondered, when reading a literary work or watching a motion picture, what is happening inside their heads. While other works tend to leave you hanging or craving for more, I wanted to take a peak at the characters mind and crazy thoughts. I would always put something different once in a while, life is full of surprises after all. One advice that I could probably give you readers, and i'm doing this myself, is that don't expect anything, don't predict, predict, and predict... just lose yourself in reading and you'll enjoy a whole lot of stories. Hihi. Love you guys.  
作者笔记：我知道，我知道。这花了我好久时间。哈哈哈。向大家深深致歉。写第一人称视角确实不易，但我真的很想恰当地展现某些只有亲身经历才能充分传达的情景。我尽力忠于角色的个性，但也想融入一些自己的风格。我一直好奇，在阅读文学作品或观看电影时，他们的内心世界究竟是怎样的。有些作品会让你悬念重重或渴望更多，而我则想窥探角色的内心和疯狂想法。我总会时不时加入些不同的元素，毕竟生活充满了惊喜。给读者的一条建议，也是我自己正在实践的，就是不要期待，不要预测，预测，再预测……只需沉浸在阅读中，你会享受到更多故事的乐趣。嘻嘻。爱你们哦。

### Comment
[Gob Hobblin](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4040599/Gob-Hobblin): 
It's a very unique way to pace a story. The choppy sentences and almost steam-of-consciousness style fits Rei to a tee, at least the first iteration of her. It helps to convery the sense of self, sense of place, and what has to be her general thought process. I agree that the incest angle is always a strange route to go (not my preferred pairing, either), but I do like reading Rei and Shinji stories, simply because there's something so Greek to the whole thing (like the reference in the title, by the way). It's not that it's PRECISELY messed up, but it is something well outside the bell curve of normal or accepted human behavior. But as one of the earlier reviewers pointed out, it's a messed up universe.
这是一种非常独特的故事节奏方式。这种句子不连贯、近乎意识蒸腾的风格非常适合玲，至少是她的第一版。这有助于凝聚自我意识、地方意识以及她的总体思维过程。我同意乱伦的角度总是很奇怪（也不是我喜欢的配对），但我确实喜欢阅读玲和真嗣的故事，只是因为整件事有一种希奇的感觉（顺便说一下，就像标题中提到的那样）。这并不是说他们真的很糟糕，而是他们的行为远远超出了正常或公认的人类行为的钟形曲线。但正如前面一位评论者所指出的，这是一个混乱的宇宙。

Despite that, I think you handled it in a very touching and sad sort of way. You really feel for Rei, the pain she's going through, and the sense that she's doing something flawed and wrong. At the same time...well, gosh darn it, you just want her to be happy and to hell with the consequences!
尽管如此，我认为你还是以一种非常感人和悲伤的方式处理了这件事。你真的能感受到玲，感受到她所经历的痛苦，感受到她所做的事情是有缺陷的、错误的。同时......天哪，你只想让她快乐，让后果见鬼去吧！

I hope this isn't a one-off chapter (I'm guessing it's not, based on some of your comments), and you continue this story. I'm curious to see where you go with this. Thanks for the excellent read!
我希望这不是一个一次性的章节（根据你的一些评论，我猜这不是），希望你能继续这个故事。我很想知道你会怎么写。感谢您的精彩阅读！

[Malevolent Dark Reflection](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2251159/Malevolent-Dark-Reflection): I love this story! Don't really care if it's incest. The Rei x Shinji stories I've read haven't addressed it to the degree that you do, so it actually makes this story more interesting. For someone who doesn't "get" Rei, you've made me very sympathetic towards her situation. Her feelings are so strong as to be almost yandere like. I'm really pulling for her. Update soon!
我喜欢这个故事！不在乎是否有乱伦。我读过的丽×真嗣故事并没有如你这般深入探讨，所以这实际上使得这个故事更有趣。对于一个不"理解"丽的人来说，你让我对她的处境非常有同情心。她的感情是如此强烈，几乎像是病态的。我真的为她加油。快更新吧！

[KendrixTermina](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1445526/KendrixTermina): 
Most R/S material tends to circumvent that angle, and if AU is used, then mostly to remove that angle, not to highlight it, but I guess an "outsider's" (that is, not-a-fanatical-Rei-fan's) perspective might help to create one unique story there.
大多数的丽嗣文作者都倾向于绕过这个角度，如果使用AU，那么大多数情况下是为了消除这个角度，而不是突出它，但我想一个"局外人"（也就是，不是狂热的罗伊斯粉丝）的观点可能有助于创造一个独特的故事。

I liked that stream-of-conciousness writing style you used. It feels like it could become really good in due time/already is pretty nice. The parts actually involving Shinji as an active player seemed remarkably IC, just the... hesitation there.
It's the mark of a good writer than you can emphasize with Rei like this even though she's not your favorite. I can never tell if I got Asuka right or not, I just don't get her.
我喜欢你使用的意识流写作风格。感觉在适当的时间内/已经很好了。实际上涉及到真司作为一个活跃参与者的部分似乎非常符合人物形象，只是... 在那里有一些犹豫。一个好作家的标志就是你能这样强调丽，即使她不是你最喜欢的人。我永远无法确定我是否正确地描绘了明日香，我只是无法理解她。

It is something that's often overlooked that Rei, at least her second incarnation that we saw for most the show, had a certain straightforward bluntness, a brutal honesty as one of her defining traits. You got that down quite well.
人们常常忽视的一点是，丽，至少在我们大部分时间看到的二代丽，有一种直白率，作为她的主要特征之一的残酷诚实。你表现得相当好。

But be careful not to make her too yandere, we're talking about someone who had some compassion left for a rival who was always pushing her around (ep 22) and even for a thing that was trying to absorb her...
但要小心不要让她变得太病态，我们谈论的是一个对一直欺负她的竞争对手留有一些同情心（第22集）甚至对一个试图吸收她的东西留有同情心的人...

Sorry, this no longer really felt like Rei/things she would think. If making her all yandere/possesive wasn't your intention, it sorta does seem like it, a little bit.Don't think she'd say something like "insensitive bastard".
抱歉，这实际上不再像是丽/她会思考的事情了。如果你的意图并不是让她变得病态/占有欲强，但看起来似乎是，至少有一点。我认为她不会说出"无情的混蛋"这样的话。
